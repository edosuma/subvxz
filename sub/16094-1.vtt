They say the great thing aboutbeing a kidis,
it's so easy to pretend.

00:33.445 --> 00:38.883
You can have a conversation
with your dog, ora baseball, ora banana.

00:39.017 --> 00:43.078
Well, whatifit wasn'tpretend?
What ifyou couldhave a conversation?

00:43.188 --> 00:47.420
l mean, not with a baseball ora banana -
that's ridiculous. But with your dog...

00:47.492 --> 00:52.395
l mean, we don't have the same concept
of time that, for instance, people do.

00:52.464 --> 00:56.059
Because you have watches and clocks.

00:56.168 --> 01:01.265
But we do know that you go away. And it's
not like we don't know that you're gone.

01:01.373 --> 01:04.171
So, we don't know exactly how long, no.

01:04.242 --> 01:07.871
Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?

01:07.980 --> 01:11.677
Well, that's just kinda
our way of shaking hands.

01:11.783 --> 01:15.844
lf you really wanna get a sense of
who somebody is, you gotta snifftheir butt.

01:15.921 --> 01:19.254
Son. Stop talkin' to the dog.

01:19.324 --> 01:21.588
She doesn't understand a word.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.288
At firsthis dad thought ''Hey, it's harmless.''

01:24.396 --> 01:29.527
But as time went on, John crossed that
fine line between harmless andjust weird.

01:29.635 --> 01:30.659
Mr Galvin.

01:30.736 --> 01:32.897
- Mr Dolittle.
- This is my son John.

01:33.005 --> 01:37.442
- John, this is your new principal, Mr Galvin.
- Nice to meet you, John.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.877
That's not good.

01:43.949 --> 01:46.247
- Nice to meet you.
- John...!

01:48.654 --> 01:51.145
lt was time to putan end to it.

01:52.557 --> 01:55.355
Thank you for coming, Reverend.

02:02.734 --> 02:08.330
Leave this boy, devil man. Go now, Satan.
Take the serpent's voices with you.

02:08.440 --> 02:13.434
l command you to come outta this boy.
Come on outta this boy.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.571
God said it. Come on!

02:15.681 --> 02:17.842
l'm gonna bite ya.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.141
Get off.

02:20.252 --> 02:23.449
Get this dog... get this dog off of me.

02:29.194 --> 02:31.685
She was my best friend.

02:31.763 --> 02:35.199
You'll make some real friends now.

02:35.801 --> 02:38.964
From that day on, John Dolittle
never spoke to animals again.

02:39.071 --> 02:42.336
Someday, you're gonna thank me for this.

02:42.407 --> 02:44.671
And aftera while allhe couldremember

02:44.743 --> 02:47.371
was that deep down
there was something missing.

02:47.879 --> 02:53.317
And, justlike his dad wanted, he grew up
to be a regularguy. You know, miserable.

02:53.385 --> 02:55.615
Hey! Hey, get outta here.

03:06.098 --> 03:09.363
Stupid mutt.
A vicious animal's in the hallway.

03:10.836 --> 03:17.105
Did lmention he was a father? A lotlike his
own father, who was a father to him before

03:17.209 --> 03:18.904
he himselfbecame...

03:19.711 --> 03:21.542
She's gota giant egg.

03:25.617 --> 03:30.350
- Good morning, Charisse.
- l have changed my name to Paprika.

03:30.422 --> 03:33.516
Paprika? Paprika Dolittle.
That has a nice ring to it.

03:33.592 --> 03:36.959
Not Dolittle. Just Paprika.

03:37.028 --> 03:39.963
Well, l don't understand it.
What is that about?

03:40.031 --> 03:42.829
You know, Salt-n-Pepa? Paprika?

03:42.934 --> 03:47.200
- OK. Paprika. l get it.
- l think Paprika is a beautiful name.

03:47.272 --> 03:49.934
Really? l think Paprika
sounds like a seasoning.

03:51.777 --> 03:54.803
- Dolittle.
- He doesn't take anything we want seriously.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.745
Tell me about it.

03:56.815 --> 03:59.249
l did go over the proposal. lt's unbelievable.

03:59.351 --> 04:03.287
- OK, l'm on my way in now.
- Maya, where are you goin' with that?

04:03.388 --> 04:07.154
- lt's for my swan egg l found.
- Looks like it'd be a good omelette.

04:07.459 --> 04:11.361
- lt's gonna hatch any day now.
- You'll miss that cos you'll be at camp.

04:11.429 --> 04:17.231
l can't go. When a bird hatches, the first thing
it sees, it bonds with it. l want it to be me.

04:17.302 --> 04:21.500
You know, it is not healthy for you
to spend all your time with your experiments.

04:21.606 --> 04:25.702
An experiment for you would be to spend
time with kids your own age at camp,

04:25.811 --> 04:29.076
which is exactly where you're goin'
this Sunday - camp.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.843
And what about my pet egg?

04:31.917 --> 04:35.444
Here. Here's half a dozen pet eggs
to take with you to camp.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.250
- Stop it.
- l don't know what all the fuss is about.

04:38.323 --> 04:42.384
We went and bought you that thing -
what was that pet rat thing that we bought?

04:42.460 --> 04:46.829
- A guinea pig.
- The thing died. And it's not our fault.

04:46.898 --> 04:49.867
lt didn't die.
His name is Rodney and he's in my room.

04:49.935 --> 04:52.426
So why are you bothering me
about the swan...?

04:52.504 --> 04:55.064
- l'm goin' to work. Goodbye.
- Bye.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.405
Have a nice day, everybody. Nice day.

05:03.882 --> 05:07.750
Johnny. Gene has got some qualms
about the new proposal. Talk to him.

05:07.853 --> 05:11.687
- No room for qualms, Gene.
- No room for qualms.

05:11.756 --> 05:15.522
- Qualms are bad.
- Qualms are bad. Listen to Johnny.

05:15.627 --> 05:17.959
l have qualms l'd like to discuss.

05:18.063 --> 05:22.762
l'm just afraid that ifwe let a big company
like Calnet take us over,

05:22.868 --> 05:25.701
you know, we're not gonna be us any more.

05:25.937 --> 05:29.873
- You know? We'd be them.
- Let me explain.

05:30.442 --> 05:33.275
''Them'' has the best hospitals,
the best labs,

05:33.345 --> 05:37.509
and ''them'' is gonna pay us
a very big, giant amount of money.

05:37.582 --> 05:41.313
l swear to God that
when l think about the money, l get teary.

05:41.386 --> 05:45.288
- Look at me.
- Those are real tears in his eyes.

05:45.357 --> 05:49.691
So Saturday we're sitting down with the
Calnet people. l'm very excited about it.

05:49.761 --> 05:54.061
Hey, wait. Whoa. Saturday morning? l'm
supposed to take my family to the country.

05:54.132 --> 05:56.191
Well, don't.

05:56.801 --> 05:59.065
You see? lt's happening already.

05:59.137 --> 06:03.130
- What?
- You're being forced to neglect your family.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.608
Gene, relax. No such thing.

06:06.711 --> 06:09.578
- Mrs O'Brien?
- Yes.

06:09.681 --> 06:12.946
How are you? ls your tummy still...?

06:13.018 --> 06:17.079
Saturday morning, guys.
Gene, no tank tops, please.

06:17.155 --> 06:20.022
- Mrs Parkus.
- Yes, Doctor?

06:20.125 --> 06:23.993
- Mrs Parkus. Have you eaten shellfish again?
- Just soft-shell crab.

06:24.095 --> 06:26.427
- And what's the middle word?
- Shell.

06:27.565 --> 06:30.033
Rodney's lost. He's not in his cage.

06:30.135 --> 06:32.399
Y'all get goin'. l'll find your hamster.

06:32.504 --> 06:36.235
- He's a guinea pig.
- Whatever. lt's a rodent. l'll find the rodent.

06:36.374 --> 06:38.433
Hey, Nutmeg, let's go.

06:40.011 --> 06:43.572
You better wipe that look offyour face.

06:43.648 --> 06:45.639
That's better.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.810
- She's turnin' into a wiseass.
- She's turning into you.

06:49.254 --> 06:54.590
You know, there's more to this HMO deal
than money. You sell, they own you.

06:54.659 --> 06:56.752
This will be good for us.

06:56.828 --> 07:02.198
l am so tired ofthat rap. lt's always for us.
But sometimes l don't know who ''us'' is.

07:02.267 --> 07:06.203
What do you mean? Us is us.
Me and you and Maya and Charisse.

07:06.271 --> 07:11.834
Lisa, the more money you have, the more
time you can spend with your family.

07:11.943 --> 07:16.573
Meanwhile you'll just have to make do with
this fancy sports car you always wanted.

07:16.648 --> 07:20.140
- Right here. Beautiful.
- Oh, my God, John. You didn't!

07:20.218 --> 07:25.053
No, l didn't. But l saw how fluttery you got,
so don't tell me you don't care about money.

07:25.156 --> 07:29.456
- ''John, you didn't!''
- That's not funny.

07:29.561 --> 07:32.621
So, Daddy, you have to find Rodney.

07:32.697 --> 07:36.098
- l'll put down some ofthat sticky paper.
- No, don't.

07:36.201 --> 07:39.864
Don't worry. You peel him
right off it and he'll live.

07:39.971 --> 07:45.671
Tell you what. l will turn the house upside
down and l will find Rodney for you. Yes?

07:45.777 --> 07:50.407
- And call me if my egg starts to hatch.
- l will call you ifyour egg starts to hatch.

08:31.823 --> 08:33.347
Ma!

08:38.696 --> 08:40.323
Let's go. Let's go.

08:40.465 --> 08:43.457
Get in there. And you stay in there.

08:57.849 --> 08:58.873
Dolittle.

09:02.487 --> 09:05.047
Mrs Parkus, do you have a death wish?

09:05.123 --> 09:07.353
But l took it out ofthe shell.

09:08.793 --> 09:11.887
- Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

09:12.864 --> 09:16.061
- You couldn't tell what it was without me?
- l knew what it was.

09:16.134 --> 09:18.329
She was frightened. She wanted her doctor.

09:18.403 --> 09:22.169
- lt's a beautiful thing.
- That's a beautiful thing?

09:22.273 --> 09:24.298
- How old are you?
- 26.

09:24.375 --> 09:29.711
You spend all your time here, right? Probably
grab your naps curled up in the break room.

09:29.781 --> 09:32.944
Occasional nooky with
one ofthe interns in the closet.

09:33.017 --> 09:37.920
l have a real life. And l'd appreciate it ifyou
only called me when it was a real emergency.

09:37.989 --> 09:40.890
lf a patient comes in
carrying his own head, call me.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.985
Somebody has a bicycle up their ass,
call me. Understand?

09:44.095 --> 09:47.758
Yeah, l understand.
So, you want me to give her the injection?

09:47.832 --> 09:51.393
l would not be a smartass right now
if l was you.

09:51.536 --> 09:56.906
Making little smart statements to me
at two o'clock in the morning after l came...

10:08.920 --> 10:11.184
ls there something wrong, Doctor?

10:11.923 --> 10:13.982
No, Mrs Parkus.

10:16.361 --> 10:18.056
There we go.

10:18.163 --> 10:19.858
- OK.
- Thank you.

10:19.964 --> 10:21.556
You're welcome.

11:07.712 --> 11:10.442
Watch where you're goin'
next time, bonehead.

11:34.005 --> 11:38.237
Let me start by saying thank you very much
for giving up part ofyour weekend.

11:38.309 --> 11:42.268
We just want to make sure
we can answer any and all ofyour questions.

11:42.347 --> 11:45.407
We want you to be comfortable
with what we're proposing.

11:45.483 --> 11:49.749
And, speaking ofwhich,
that explains the details ofthe buyout.

11:49.854 --> 11:54.291
The information you're probably
most interested in is on page four.

11:54.359 --> 11:57.692
Wow, four million dollars.
That's pretty comfortable.

11:57.762 --> 12:01.960
- l'm comfortable. You comfortable, Geno?
- l have some questions.

12:02.066 --> 12:04.330
- No, you don't.
- Yes, l do.

12:05.236 --> 12:07.670
Are we gonna have to cut back on our staff?

12:07.739 --> 12:10.503
Yes. Unfortunately,
we'll have to make some cuts.

12:11.109 --> 12:12.667
Bread?

12:12.744 --> 12:14.837
No, thank you.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.843
- ''No, thank you''?
- Yeah. You offered me some bread.

12:18.916 --> 12:23.114
- l don't want any, thanks.
- So you have no problem with staff cuts?

12:23.187 --> 12:26.748
- You gonna share that bread?
- You just said you didn't want any.

12:26.858 --> 12:30.089
- What is it, some kind ofjoke?
- Absolutely not.

12:30.161 --> 12:32.994
- Bagel chips!
- Back off or you'll find your nuts in a tree.

12:33.097 --> 12:34.689
Where's the love?

12:34.766 --> 12:38.930
So, John, do you have a problem
with that or not? John?

12:39.003 --> 12:42.769
- Watch your head.
- That's enough meeting for me. l gotta go.

12:42.874 --> 12:45.399
This was a great meeting. Very productive.

12:45.510 --> 12:47.978
Wonderful meeting.
See you guys on Monday.

12:48.079 --> 12:50.980
l'll talk to you later. 'Scuse me.

12:52.150 --> 12:56.314
Johnny's been on call all night,
Mr Calloway. He's very excited.

13:05.730 --> 13:07.789
You gotta move it.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.966
l said let's go. You can't park here.

13:12.036 --> 13:16.302
Oh, jeez. Thanks, man.
OK, l'm movin' it. Thank you.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.788
This is ridiculous.

13:47.138 --> 13:49.868
Boy, we gotsome fresh airhere.

13:49.974 --> 13:53.842
That's the thing about the city.
You don't realise it...

13:53.945 --> 13:56.004
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.182
l should've put on my seat belt.

13:59.250 --> 14:04.483
Easy now. Easy now.
Slow your butt down! Whoa.

14:07.158 --> 14:09.353
Jeez, Louise! That didn't seem too safe.

14:10.194 --> 14:12.185
My back hurt.

14:12.263 --> 14:16.495
This is a dream. l'm dreaming right now.

14:16.601 --> 14:20.059
Hold it. Stop.
You're talkin' and l understand you.

14:21.072 --> 14:26.908
Those guys in my dorm told me that stuff
was safe. 15 years later, this starts happenin'.

14:27.011 --> 14:29.502
Let's chill. Let's just chill.

14:30.848 --> 14:33.817
l'm not gonna chill. You gonna chill.

14:33.885 --> 14:36.649
- Are you switchin' sides?
- All right, you. Come on.

14:36.788 --> 14:40.781
- Hey, l can't drive.
- Out. Let's go.

14:41.826 --> 14:44.090
- Need some help?
- No. We're fine.

14:44.195 --> 14:47.824
- l'm just stretchin' my legs.
- Ask her if she's got any lettuce.

14:47.899 --> 14:52.666
- Shut your little furry mouth right now.
- Are you sure you're OK?

14:54.472 --> 14:56.997
Yeah. l'm fine.

14:57.074 --> 15:00.202
- That's good.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:00.278 --> 15:02.337
- Goodbye.
- Now what?

15:05.149 --> 15:06.013
Monster!

15:06.083 --> 15:08.483
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Leave me alone.

15:08.553 --> 15:11.954
- What are you, nuts? l'll roast.
- Stay away or l'll kill you.

15:12.056 --> 15:16.516
Don't leave me out here. lt's hot.
Hey, what kind of doc are you?

15:16.627 --> 15:19.425
Hey, doc. This is cruel to animals.

15:22.099 --> 15:24.226
Come on. l'm your friend.

15:24.302 --> 15:26.361
l'm your buddy.

15:26.971 --> 15:29.064
Reverse.

15:30.174 --> 15:35.908
That's it. Back up. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't run over the cage now.

15:38.916 --> 15:42.147
Man, you scared the crap outta me.
See? There it is.

15:42.253 --> 15:44.517
Shut up. Shut up right now.

15:45.256 --> 15:48.919
Say one more word and l'll leave you
here in the road. Understand?

15:48.993 --> 15:50.654
OK, OK, OK.

15:53.698 --> 15:55.928
Stop. Slow down.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.298
Shut up. l can hear you up there. Shut up.

15:58.369 --> 16:00.860
l'm gettin' whisker-whipped up here.

16:00.938 --> 16:06.774
One more word and l'm gonna pull over, let
you out your cage and leave you in the wild.

16:06.911 --> 16:10.312
See how much you talk
with real squirrels kickin' in your ass.

16:10.381 --> 16:12.281
Fine, then l'll sing.

16:16.087 --> 16:18.578
- You know it is.
- Turnin' up the radio.

16:20.091 --> 16:22.992
- l can't hear you. l'm groovin'.
- Come on. Let me in.

16:23.094 --> 16:28.157
Hey, why they call me guinea pig anyway?
l'm not ltalian and l'm not pork.

16:32.603 --> 16:35.902
Grandpa, did Daddy learn
how to be bossy from you?

16:35.973 --> 16:38.771
Maya, don't talk to your grandfather that way.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.937
He certainly didn't learn it from his mother,
God rest her soul.

16:43.014 --> 16:49.146
One day you'll understand that sometimes
your parents do know what they're doing.

16:53.991 --> 16:57.552
- l made it.
- Daddy, what's Rodney doing on the roof?

16:57.628 --> 17:01.120
l thought the fresh air
would do him some good, honey.

17:01.198 --> 17:02.927
- Hey.
- Are you OK?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.126
l'm fine.

17:04.201 --> 17:05.930
- Hey.
- Lunatic.

17:06.002 --> 17:08.733
Daddy, we still got those BB guns
l used to play with?

17:08.806 --> 17:11.273
- Crazy man.
- BB gun?

17:11.375 --> 17:12.773
Psycho.

17:12.877 --> 17:16.938
- Son, l think you need a vacation.
- And l'm gonna have one too.

17:17.013 --> 17:22.816
This is beautiful. 'Scuse me, honey.
Hey, what's that step called?

17:25.021 --> 17:27.217
Let's get rid of Maya's little rat thing.

17:27.290 --> 17:32.422
He's a guinea pig.
l don't know why you let him get to you.

17:32.496 --> 17:36.557
l goan get gim. l guss... Gugga geggond.

17:42.440 --> 17:46.103
l'm not lettin' him get to me. Not the least bit.

17:46.210 --> 17:48.269
Good.

17:52.650 --> 17:56.780
- l'll be right back.
- ls it all right if l wait in the bed naked?

17:56.854 --> 17:58.583
Yes.

17:58.656 --> 18:01.386
Time to come out ofthese drawers, then.

18:01.459 --> 18:03.518
Hello!

18:04.495 --> 18:06.520
Out here.

18:06.631 --> 18:08.292
Yeah.

18:08.399 --> 18:11.493
- There you are.
- Oh, my God.

18:12.069 --> 18:13.832
Hello.

18:15.139 --> 18:18.870
That's right. You're the one
who can hear us, aren't you?

18:19.010 --> 18:21.478
No, l'm not hearing anything.
l can't hear you.

18:21.545 --> 18:25.447
The whole woods are talking about you,
you know.

18:25.516 --> 18:27.677
Listen, can you do me a favour?

18:27.752 --> 18:32.246
Can you just take this stick out of my wing?
lt's killin' me. Can ya, huh?

18:34.291 --> 18:37.317
Don't worry. l won't hurt you.

18:44.101 --> 18:47.036
Much better. Good job. Thank you.

18:51.308 --> 18:53.435
What's happenin' to me?

18:53.511 --> 18:57.504
You're gonna be
pleasantly surprised, that's what.

19:00.051 --> 19:03.748
- Oh, my goodness. lt's an owl.
- Yeah, a big, nasty owl. Let's go in.

19:03.854 --> 19:06.288
- lt's beautiful.
- They're very dangerous.

19:06.357 --> 19:09.292
- No, they're not.
- They are. They can poke your eye out.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.852
- Come on!
- Yes, they can. Very easily.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.865
- Take a finger off.
- What you doin' with that owl?

19:15.933 --> 19:19.596
Go get into bed.
l'm gonna go check on Charisse and Maya.

19:19.704 --> 19:21.365
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine.

19:21.472 --> 19:24.305
- Are you sure?
- Get to bed. Please?

19:24.375 --> 19:26.309
- OK.
- Five minutes.

19:32.516 --> 19:35.076
Crazy man! You havin' fun in there.

19:40.591 --> 19:44.391
Can l make a request?
Can l get tuna in oil instead ofwater?

19:44.495 --> 19:46.554
Who put in that bug-zapper?

19:50.534 --> 19:52.695
l'm nasty.

19:52.770 --> 19:59.175
Yo, looky here. Hey, buddy, my old lady
asks, l been eatin' trash all night. You dig?

19:59.243 --> 20:01.336
You're on my tail, you idiot.

20:01.412 --> 20:04.210
Got to lose that bug light.
l know you can hear me.

20:04.315 --> 20:07.580
Hey, doc, while you're out, get some salmon.

20:07.651 --> 20:10.711
- Hey, buddy. All night.
- You broke Mr Stinky, l think.

20:10.788 --> 20:13.348
- Keep away!
- John? What are you doing?

20:13.424 --> 20:16.621
- l have to go back to the city, honey.
- Wait! John, why?

20:16.727 --> 20:18.957
- John, you just got here.
- l need a doctor.

20:19.063 --> 20:22.328
l mean, l am a doctor
and l got beeped, so l gotta go.

20:22.399 --> 20:26.165
l'm very sorry, hon. l'll talk to you later.

20:27.171 --> 20:29.731
l love you so much.

20:29.807 --> 20:31.001
(coughs)

20:34.745 --> 20:36.804
(squawks)

20:40.251 --> 20:43.379
- (ringing tone)
- Come on. Pick up the phone. Pick it up!

20:43.454 --> 20:47.857
- DrLitvack.
- Hello, Sam, how are you? lt's John Dolittle!

20:47.958 --> 20:52.452
- John?
- How you doin'? So, enjoying your summer?

20:52.563 --> 20:56.397
Jeez, it's really late, John.
lt's one o'clock in the morning.

20:56.467 --> 21:01.268
ls it really? Wow! l didn't realise it was
that late. l'm sorry. l'm on my way into town.

21:01.372 --> 21:06.002
l wondered ifyou wanted to get together
for a drink or a CAT scan or somethin'.

21:06.110 --> 21:08.408
A CATscan?

21:08.479 --> 21:10.572
Can it wait tillmorning?

21:10.648 --> 21:12.980
l love you.

21:15.219 --> 21:17.278
No, l have to come right now.

21:27.264 --> 21:29.232
- What's wrong?
- Your face.

21:29.300 --> 21:33.828
- l'll hit you so hard you'll see ten more of me.
- lt already smells like ten more ofyou.

21:33.904 --> 21:36.737
Come on. Bring it on. l'll tear you to pieces.

21:36.841 --> 21:40.038
- You are tempting fate now, buddy.
- Right here, fat boy.

21:40.144 --> 21:42.237
Put it right here. l'll murderise you.

21:42.313 --> 21:46.272
- Stick 'em up, you little rat.
- Hey, come here, you gerbil.

21:46.350 --> 21:48.511
- Hey, what are you looking at?
- Me?

21:48.619 --> 21:51.520
Yeah, you. Who else, buddy?

21:51.622 --> 21:54.921
l'm lookin' at a couple of greasy rats
fightin' over garbage.

21:55.025 --> 21:58.119
Come here and say that,
you four-eyed dufus biped!

21:58.229 --> 22:00.891
l'll get bubonic on your ass. Come here.

22:01.232 --> 22:04.861
What if l take that light bulb,
put it between your butt cheeks

22:04.935 --> 22:07.165
and make a rodent lamp out ofyou?

22:07.271 --> 22:10.468
Let me tell you somethin'.
l'm a human. l'm a human.

22:10.541 --> 22:14.944
Hey. Sam, how are you? How are you?
Thanks for comin' down, Sam. Thanks.

22:16.347 --> 22:21.080
- There's no abnormalities of any kind.
- All right, then.

22:21.185 --> 22:23.915
- Why are you hearing animal voices?
- Exactly.

22:23.988 --> 22:27.287
Why do l think l am if everything is fine?
l tell ya, Sam,

22:28.525 --> 22:32.791
l don't wanna wind up like one ofthese guys
on the street, talking to myself

22:32.897 --> 22:36.355
and stinking, with my hair all matted.
lt's not a cool look.

22:36.467 --> 22:40.494
Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?

22:41.071 --> 22:46.304
Not really. My wife's been givin' me
a hard time about Calnet, but that can't be it.

22:46.610 --> 22:49.408
- Small potatoes.
- l did hit a dog the other day.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.378
Oh, my God! A dog?

22:52.483 --> 22:56.214
- Hey, make me feel worse, huh?
- Well, l'm sorry, but a little doggie?

22:56.320 --> 22:59.312
- The dog was fine. lt got up and ran off.
- He was injured?

22:59.390 --> 23:02.723
He felt well enough to scream out
''bonehead'' before he left.

23:04.094 --> 23:08.428
- John, the dog couldn't have spoken to you.
- Well, Sam, with all due respect...

23:08.532 --> 23:13.231
No, John. The dog did not speak to you.

23:14.571 --> 23:18.507
Maybe you're right.
l'm sorry l woke you up for this.

23:19.510 --> 23:21.034
Thanks.

23:21.145 --> 23:22.908
- Hi, honey.
- Are you all right?

23:22.980 --> 23:25.574
- l'm OK.
- Are you sure?

23:25.649 --> 23:27.981
Really. l just freaked out a little bit.

23:28.052 --> 23:30.520
- What's wrong?
- l got stress l been under.

23:30.587 --> 23:33.147
- From what?
- The merger and the practice.

23:33.257 --> 23:35.521
lt's all come to a head, and l'm sorry.

23:35.592 --> 23:38.459
OK, John, just come back out here, OK?

23:38.562 --> 23:41.531
Yeah, l'm on my w...
Yeah, l'm on my way out now.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.732
Bonehead!

23:45.803 --> 23:47.930
- l'll see you in a few.
- John?

23:49.139 --> 23:49.969
John?

23:57.948 --> 24:02.681
- 'Scuse me. Where's the stray dogs?
- Right this way.

24:05.489 --> 24:07.616
- Yo!
- What's up?

24:09.660 --> 24:11.753
Hey, buddy.

24:11.829 --> 24:13.421
Over here.

24:13.497 --> 24:17.558
Hey, mister.
Bet you l won't bite nobody again.

24:18.969 --> 24:21.028
l am Keyser Soze.

24:21.105 --> 24:24.097
l have owners.
They've just been out oftown for a few...

24:24.208 --> 24:26.301
..a few years.

24:27.211 --> 24:30.908
- Dead dog walkin'.
- That does not sound good.

24:31.015 --> 24:35.213
When are we gonna get
some decent chow in here?

24:36.420 --> 24:39.446
Hey, thanks a lot. Whoa, that was close, huh?

24:39.523 --> 24:42.390
Hey, hey, you got kids?
Kids, they're the greatest.

24:42.459 --> 24:45.986
- Kids are great(!) What the hell is goin' on?
- Hey, you understood me.

24:46.063 --> 24:49.294
You don't say.
How come l can understand you talkin'?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.664
l don't know. Maybe you're just weird.

24:51.735 --> 24:54.295
Hey, shut up. You're a dog. Dogs can't talk.

24:54.405 --> 24:57.067
What do you think barking is?
An involuntary spasm(?)

24:57.141 --> 25:00.008
l don't know what it is.
l know you're not barking.

25:00.077 --> 25:02.875
And l'm going to be with my family.
Good luck to you.

25:02.946 --> 25:05.141
That's it?

25:07.718 --> 25:12.849
lt must be that truck exhaust or something.
Oh, no! Everything's going black.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.150
lt's not good.

25:26.737 --> 25:28.898
Thank you. Oops.

25:30.140 --> 25:33.701
ls that the biggest ass you've ever seen?

25:33.777 --> 25:35.836
Lie down.

25:35.913 --> 25:40.782
Lie down. Lie down, Chauncy.

25:42.352 --> 25:46.755
- He's deaf.
- l'm not. l just can't stand listening to her.

25:46.857 --> 25:51.191
Just don't fix me, OK? Please. Don't fix me.

25:51.995 --> 25:54.657
l won't look at another female ever, l swear.

25:54.731 --> 25:59.998
Anything but my manhood, man.
Not my manhood, please! l'm...

26:00.604 --> 26:04.404
Yo, baby, what's up?
You lookin' sweet there, sugar. ls it the...

26:04.508 --> 26:08.274
No. Don't, please.
Please, ju... No, no, no, don't.

26:08.378 --> 26:10.539
Please, l'm begging you.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.175
Dolittle.

26:14.284 --> 26:16.309
Come on.

26:24.828 --> 26:27.797
So, what seems to be the problem?

26:27.898 --> 26:32.335
Well, l really think it's pulmonary distress.
And he might have fluid on his lungs.

26:32.903 --> 26:36.202
- Let me guess. You're an MD.
- Yes, l am.

26:36.306 --> 26:41.209
l can always tell when a real doctor comes in.
They always do a little amateur diagnosis.

26:41.311 --> 26:46.510
- Tell him to get away from my butt.
- l did go to veterinary school for five years.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.916
ls itjust me,
or is he hovering around my butt a lot?

26:49.987 --> 26:53.946
And unlike an MD,
my patient cannot tell me where it hurts.

26:54.024 --> 26:56.652
Seriously,
could you tell him my butt is great?

26:56.760 --> 27:00.321
So, Doctor, ifyou don't mind...

27:00.430 --> 27:02.591
Hey, where's he's gonna put that?

27:02.666 --> 27:06.796
Look, look, l was faking it, OK? l feel fine.
Just don't let him stick that...

27:06.870 --> 27:08.599
Hello!

27:08.672 --> 27:10.970
Let's just have a listen to those lungs.

27:11.041 --> 27:13.942
l'm gonna swallow it.
And l don't mean in my mouth.

27:14.011 --> 27:16.639
Dr Fish, l should pull that out a little bit.

27:16.747 --> 27:20.615
- Don't you touch that.
- lt's headin' in. lt's goin' south for the winter.

27:22.352 --> 27:26.652
Now, you see? l have to interpret
what the dog is moaning about.

27:26.757 --> 27:30.488
What's to interpret?
There's a thermometer. lt's in my butt.

27:30.961 --> 27:34.294
- Take it easy. lt'll be over in a minute.
- What?

27:34.431 --> 27:38.367
- Yes.
- Well, there it goes. Buttjust swallowed it.

27:39.102 --> 27:44.301
Doctor? l'm just guessing, but l think
you might have just lost your thermometer.

27:52.783 --> 27:54.512
lt's gone.

27:55.986 --> 27:58.318
All right, l have... l have three options.

27:58.655 --> 28:01.783
- One: l can manually retrieve it.
- What's he sayin'?

28:01.858 --> 28:03.917
Options. Retrieve it manually.

28:04.027 --> 28:08.987
- Pass.
- Two: give the dog a laxative and wait it out.

28:09.066 --> 28:11.830
And three: surgically remove it.

28:11.902 --> 28:14.063
- A laxative or surgery.
- Laxative!

28:14.638 --> 28:18.506
Why don't you just give him a laxative?
lt'd probably come out later on.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.510
- Never works.
- So what would you suggest?

28:24.314 --> 28:27.010
l'd like to go in manually.

28:31.822 --> 28:34.518
- Here we go.
- Oh, my Lord!

28:34.658 --> 28:38.059
This is not good. Lassie go home!

28:45.902 --> 28:50.168
Why on earth would a guy
go into a line ofwork like that?

28:50.274 --> 28:54.904
- All right. That's it for you. Hit the road.
- What? But l'm your pet.

28:54.978 --> 28:59.915
You are not my pet. lf l were gonna get a pet,
l wouldn't get one as annoying as you. Go.

29:00.350 --> 29:04.343
Hey, don't worry about it.
You sprung me from the joint. l'm thankful.

29:04.454 --> 29:06.945
- Yeah. Just go.
- Don't worry about me.

29:07.057 --> 29:10.549
l'll just be goin' down the road,
disappearing without a trace.

29:11.728 --> 29:14.196
l hope a car doesn't hit me.
Oh, well, one less dog.

29:14.298 --> 29:16.198
- Dolittle.
- Hi, Daddy.

29:16.300 --> 29:20.566
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?
- Am l gonna see you before l go to camp?

29:20.671 --> 29:23.469
l'm really workin' on it.

29:23.573 --> 29:25.370
Get outta here.

29:25.475 --> 29:28.171
- Daddy, is that a dog?
- Yeah, but it's a...

29:28.779 --> 29:32.271
- Mommy, guess what. Daddy got me a dog.
- No! Daddy didn't...

29:32.349 --> 29:35.341
Hey. ls that what you've
been up to, you sneak?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.384
You caught me.

29:39.489 --> 29:42.424
What? l have allergies.

29:42.559 --> 29:45.323
Yeah, l guess we'll see you at camp.

29:46.296 --> 29:49.356
Grandpa, Daddy got me a dog.
He got me a dog.

29:49.433 --> 29:51.924
Can you believe it? My own dog.

29:53.770 --> 29:55.567
Hi.

29:55.639 --> 29:59.302
- They're gonna want to know your name.
- l don't have one.

29:59.376 --> 30:01.936
- We'll have to think of one.
- Let me see.

30:02.012 --> 30:06.142
A little girl once called me
''Please, Mommy, not him.'' How 'bout that?

30:06.216 --> 30:10.653
Nah, that's not gonna work.
You got red hair. How 'bout Lucy?

30:10.754 --> 30:13.314
Yes, l like that. Lucy. Just one problem.

30:13.390 --> 30:17.019
- l'm a guy.
- Really? How 'bout Lucky?

30:17.127 --> 30:20.654
Perfect. Lucky, yes. ''Hi, l'm Lucky.''

30:20.764 --> 30:23.164
Hey, it works on two levels. l love it.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.201
Daddy!

30:25.268 --> 30:29.398
- That's my daughter. Be nice.
- Oh, you got me a dog. Oh, he's adorable.

30:29.473 --> 30:32.340
Oh, you're such a cute dog.

30:35.245 --> 30:37.236
- What's his name?
- Lucky.

30:37.347 --> 30:41.443
- Does he do any tricks?
- He does a neat trick with a thermometer.

30:41.551 --> 30:43.246
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

30:43.353 --> 30:47.380
- You got her a dog.
- Yeah, well, l got us a dog.

30:48.258 --> 30:50.351
Are you OK?

30:51.228 --> 30:52.252
Yeah.

30:52.362 --> 30:54.455
Come on, let's get you all set up here.

30:54.564 --> 30:59.365
- Come on, Maya.
- Look at this nice rabbit on your door.

31:00.470 --> 31:02.870
This is nice.

31:02.973 --> 31:05.168
- Yeah!
- What a fun cabin.

31:07.444 --> 31:09.503
You smell the air here?

31:09.646 --> 31:12.979
What a wonderful place.
What a wonderful camp.

31:13.049 --> 31:15.449
Daddy, can l go home with you and Lucky?

31:17.421 --> 31:21.414
Hey, Maya. Look, here's the deal.

31:21.491 --> 31:25.484
You stay here for a while,
have a great time, then Lucky's all yours.

31:25.595 --> 31:28.291
Three weeks is a long time.
Can't l go home with...

31:28.398 --> 31:31.265
No. No camp, no dog.

31:34.938 --> 31:37.907
- OK, l'll stay.
- You're gonna have a great time.

31:38.008 --> 31:43.275
When you get older you're gonna thank me,
cos you'll have so many friends. You'll see.

31:43.847 --> 31:45.337
You'll see.

31:51.755 --> 31:55.122
- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's goin' by so fast.

31:55.225 --> 31:58.717
Don't you dare throw up in this car.
What are you lookin' at?

31:58.829 --> 32:01.764
The lines on the road.
They're just whippin' by.

32:01.865 --> 32:05.096
Lines. Line, line, line, line, line, line.

32:05.168 --> 32:08.569
Don't focus on somethin' so close.
Don't look at the lines.

32:09.072 --> 32:10.334
OK.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.932
Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

32:14.978 --> 32:17.173
Tree, tree, tree.

32:18.348 --> 32:20.543
Sir, could you just...

32:22.185 --> 32:24.278
Who knew?

32:26.389 --> 32:29.950
And not only could he understand me,
but it turns out he's a doctor.

32:30.060 --> 32:32.494
Look. Not even a scar.

32:32.562 --> 32:37.966
And it hurt so bad. l don't know
what l would have done without him.

32:38.068 --> 32:40.400
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yup.

32:41.471 --> 32:43.939
Oh, what a day.

32:44.007 --> 32:46.407
You have knots all over the place.

32:46.510 --> 32:50.071
l'm all messed up. l'm fallin' apart.

32:53.783 --> 32:56.775
- How's that feel?
- Mrs Dolittle!

32:56.887 --> 32:59.185
Yeah, baby!

33:02.292 --> 33:04.226
- Excuse me one second.
- OK.

33:04.327 --> 33:06.591
Excuse me just one second.

33:07.631 --> 33:10.759
- Come on. Let's go.
- What a gyp.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.962
You mind if l have a little privacy, please?

33:14.037 --> 33:17.370
Oh, yeah, but it's fine
when people watch us do it, huh?

33:17.440 --> 33:19.533
Fine to turn on the garden hose.

33:19.609 --> 33:22.510
Hey, you want a tip on a good position?

33:22.579 --> 33:25.514
- You were barking.
- Well, l'm excited.

33:25.582 --> 33:28.415
When l get excited l make all kinds of sounds.

33:29.619 --> 33:33.146
- You never barked before.
- Oh.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.060
Hello.

33:44.868 --> 33:49.328
- Yoo-hoo, doc. We got trouble here.
- Let's go.

33:49.406 --> 33:51.840
Hey! No. You take the ducks.
l'll take the goat.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.240
Me?

33:54.344 --> 33:56.471
All right. l'll get the ducks.

34:02.252 --> 34:03.651
What's goin' on?

34:03.787 --> 34:08.815
Mark just showed up. So l'm gonna have to
go over the proposal. We have to...

34:08.891 --> 34:10.449
- Come on!
- Don't do that.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.996
Lucky wants me to take him for a walk.
So l gotta do that, then l gotta deal with Mark.

34:15.065 --> 34:18.466
Great. l'll be the one cooking breakfast.

34:19.101 --> 34:20.831
Tomorrow.

34:23.039 --> 34:25.632
Hey, Mark! How you doin'?

34:25.708 --> 34:28.871
You're trying to destroy my life, all ofyou.
Aren't you?

34:28.978 --> 34:31.846
Freeze! Stop right there. Don't you move.

34:31.915 --> 34:36.318
- What are you doin' in the hallway?
- Going to the bathroom. What are you doin'?

34:37.020 --> 34:42.253
l'm p-p-patrolling the hallways. l'm the father.
l make sure it's safe while you're asleep.

34:42.324 --> 34:45.021
l patrol these halls.
You wait. Don't you move.

34:45.495 --> 34:50.626
The reason you're up this time of night is cos
you spend too much time drinkin' liquids.

34:50.699 --> 34:54.329
You're old enough to be able to hold it in.
So go on back to bed.

34:54.437 --> 34:57.099
But, Dad, l have to go.

34:58.475 --> 35:00.705
Lucky's in the bathroom right now.

35:01.411 --> 35:03.470
The dog is using the bathroom?

35:13.223 --> 35:18.058
Let me make sure he put the seat down.
Then it's your turn, OK? Don't you move.

35:20.697 --> 35:24.497
- You heard of knockin'?
- Not one quack. Not one quack.

35:30.507 --> 35:34.967
Here's the toilet. lt's all down
like y'all like it, ready for you.

35:36.046 --> 35:40.779
No little sprinklets on it or anything.
lt's waitin' for you to come and do your thing.

35:41.384 --> 35:45.115
- Dad, l don't need adult supervision.
- OK.

35:46.690 --> 35:49.955
- Somebody get this thing off me.
- Come here.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.585
Get this thing off... Whoa.

35:52.696 --> 35:54.459
Take it easy.

35:58.535 --> 36:00.901
- Night, Dad.
- Night, honey.

36:00.970 --> 36:02.801
Yeah, yeah.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.340
OK, let's go.
See what you almost made happen?

36:06.409 --> 36:09.139
What l almost made happen? What did l do?

36:09.212 --> 36:11.942
- Beep, beep! We're the sheep.
- Oh, no.

36:12.015 --> 36:14.677
- Not these clones.
- Where you goin'?

36:14.751 --> 36:17.618
- Move aside.
- Am l late?

36:17.721 --> 36:20.212
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Oh, no, no.

36:20.323 --> 36:23.486
You gonna have to take your fat ass back...
l don't...

36:23.560 --> 36:27.360
- Oh, my God! What a zoo.
- Obviously not a kosher establishment.

36:27.430 --> 36:31.628
- Everybody, just come in...
- Where are the chicks? l'm cool.

36:38.308 --> 36:40.367
Landing! Make way.

36:43.346 --> 36:45.610
Very well appointed sty.

36:48.184 --> 36:48.218
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, there's the guy.

36:48.218 --> 36:51.415
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, there's the guy.

36:51.521 --> 36:54.251
l don't know. You know, tell a friend.

36:54.357 --> 36:56.985
Looks like they need to talk to a doctor, doc.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.255
Our butts hurt.

37:00.263 --> 37:02.356
OK, let's do this.

37:02.432 --> 37:05.959
- Watch your droppings.
- This is the house of love.

37:06.035 --> 37:09.971
East coast, west coast, let's unite!
ls Brooklyn in the house?

37:10.039 --> 37:14.339
This should take care ofthe inflammation.
But who'll wipe it on for you?

37:14.410 --> 37:16.173
Does Brad Pitt need a goat?

37:16.246 --> 37:19.841
Don't be ashamed.
lt happens to most men occasionally.

37:19.983 --> 37:23.419
- You're probably under a lot of pressure.
- He's not.

37:23.486 --> 37:26.353
He's not interested because l'm just a pigeon.

37:26.422 --> 37:28.390
- But...
- He's a self-hating pigeon.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.450
- That is not true.
- Ask him what he does all day.

37:31.561 --> 37:33.688
- What do...
- l sit in a tree by myself.

37:33.897 --> 37:38.197
He's too good to eat with the rest of us
when the old people feed us in the park.

37:38.268 --> 37:41.101
- Can l speak?
- The way he stares at a robin's breast...

37:41.204 --> 37:45.834
- lt's enough to make you sick.
- l happen to be attracted to orange breasts.

37:45.909 --> 37:50.039
You're not a robin. Or a dove or a hawk.
You're a pigeon and l'm a pigeon.

37:50.113 --> 37:55.380
l'm sorry. She sits on that nest all day long,
and she just gets a little crazy.

37:55.451 --> 38:00.388
May l ask you something? lf l turn this way,
don't l look a little like a blue jay?

38:00.456 --> 38:02.856
Poor equilibrium may mean an ear infection.

38:05.895 --> 38:11.800
- Or it may be due to this.
- l'm a social drinker. Very social.

38:11.868 --> 38:14.234
Stand up. Stand up.

38:14.737 --> 38:18.730
- Touch your nose and raise your left foot.
- Nose. Leg.

38:20.910 --> 38:23.276
l don't know. l think you're wasted.

38:23.346 --> 38:26.713
- l want to see you walk this line.
- Oh, my goodness.

38:26.816 --> 38:28.443
Ooh-la-la!

38:29.886 --> 38:33.287
You have a drinking problem.
l suggest that you stop drinking.

38:33.356 --> 38:35.449
- l think you may be an alcoholic.
- Really?

38:35.525 --> 38:38.494
- Nobody likes a drunk monkey.
- Sorry.

38:38.561 --> 38:41.894
You're suffering from
obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

38:42.031 --> 38:43.089
Throw!

38:43.166 --> 38:46.533
Whenever you want the ball,
think about something else.

38:46.636 --> 38:49.571
- Just throw the ball.
- Can you relax your mind?

38:49.672 --> 38:54.336
This is the way it works. You're the person.
You throw the ball. l'm the dog. l get it.

38:54.444 --> 38:57.038
- Look at you goin'!
- l'll pee on your carpet.

38:57.113 --> 39:00.514
- lt's very irritating, this ball thing.
- Shut up and throw it.

39:00.583 --> 39:06.078
Am l alone here? Am l by myself?
Am l in another universe?

39:06.155 --> 39:10.387
- Throw the damn ball.
- He threw the ball. He threw the ball.

39:10.493 --> 39:12.859
l'll get it. Hold on. l'll get it, l'll get it.

39:12.929 --> 39:15.523
l love you. l love you. You threw the ball.

39:15.899 --> 39:18.129
You can't save 'em all, Hasselhoff.

39:18.201 --> 39:20.396
'Ey, is there a doctor in the house?

39:22.205 --> 39:23.467
Up here.

39:23.539 --> 39:26.906
Doc, they're gonna kick me offthe force.
l'm as blind as a bat.

39:26.976 --> 39:29.877
- Can you help me?
- Just gimme a minute, all right?

39:29.946 --> 39:32.141
- All right.
- Keep it quiet.

39:32.215 --> 39:34.911
Tell me what you think ofthese.

39:37.487 --> 39:41.890
Holy road apples! l can see!
No deskjob for me.

39:41.958 --> 39:44.518
- Thanks a million.
- You are most welcome.

39:45.161 --> 39:50.622
This is gonna be great. l'll make lieutenant.
Nothing can stop me. Look, a doughnut shop.

39:50.867 --> 39:50.900
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.993
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

39:53.136 --> 39:56.731
And l bet that's just the tip ofthe iceberg.
When word gets around...

39:56.806 --> 39:59.969
- Doctor, you must help us, quick.
- What happened?

40:00.209 --> 40:02.541
lt is all my fault.
l should not have let him out.

40:02.612 --> 40:05.308
- Calm down.
- The circus tiger, he will jump.

40:05.415 --> 40:08.612
- l told you to stop drinkin'.
- Drinking. l give it up.

40:08.718 --> 40:12.449
- That's better. Let's go.
- Wait for me. You don't know where it is.

40:12.755 --> 40:15.315
And now, on the day l end it all,

40:15.391 --> 40:19.919
l'd like to leave Margaret the bearded lady
my rhinestone collar and my wet-dry shaver.

40:19.996 --> 40:24.524
l'd like to leave Jack the midget nothing.
lt's too late for you. You're a short...

40:24.600 --> 40:27.433
Hey, get outta there.
You're in my landing space.

40:27.537 --> 40:30.438
- Man!
- See ifyou land on your feet, road kill.

40:30.540 --> 40:33.338
Why don't you bloodsuckin' vermin
take a break?

40:33.743 --> 40:35.870
- Blood sucking!
- Look out below.

40:35.979 --> 40:38.038
- Hey, Lucky, come on.
- Come on what?

40:38.181 --> 40:41.617
- Come on. We gotta go up there.
- Are you crazy? That's a tiger.

40:41.684 --> 40:45.643
- l'm jumping now. Don't try and stop me.
- Will you come on?

40:45.755 --> 40:48.883
Comin' right up.
One order of man, side of dog.

40:49.792 --> 40:51.657
l need a drink.

40:51.761 --> 40:53.854
Goodbye, cruel world.

40:53.963 --> 40:58.491
Oh, no, l just remembered.
l wanted to leave the whip to the baboon.

40:59.369 --> 41:01.633
One ofthe few animals that enjoys that stuff.

41:01.704 --> 41:04.502
- Hi.
- Who are you?

41:04.807 --> 41:07.571
- l'm Dolittle.
- Yeah, well, get outta here.

41:07.643 --> 41:11.909
- l'm in a lot of pain and l'm gonnajump.
- Whoa, take it easy now.

41:12.015 --> 41:15.883
- l'm a doctor. Maybe l can help.
- l don't need a doctor. l need a miracle.

41:15.985 --> 41:21.719
l'm a train wreck. l have headaches, nausea...
The worst thing is this double vision.

41:22.492 --> 41:26.622
What's the use?
lt's not like anybody cares about tigers.

41:26.696 --> 41:30.462
Now stop, you're being silly.
There have been lots of loveable tigers.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.626
Yeah? Name one.

41:34.337 --> 41:36.464
How about Tony?

41:36.539 --> 41:40.100
- Tony the cereal tiger?
- l didn't hear you come up with anything.

41:42.278 --> 41:45.338
Remember that song
''Eye ofthe Tiger'' from Rocky lll?

41:48.418 --> 41:52.548
That one from Rocky lll, when Rocky
was fightin' Mr T, couldn't beat Mr T,

41:52.655 --> 41:55.021
Apollo Creed played ''Eye ofthe Tiger'',

41:55.091 --> 42:01.052
he went back and beat the snot out of Mr T
because ofthat song. lt moved him inside.

42:01.130 --> 42:04.429
Not ''Eye ofthe Moose'', not ''Eye ofthe Bull''.
''Eye ofthe Tiger''.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.764
- That's it. l'm jumping.
- No, no, don't.

42:06.869 --> 42:11.329
Jump, you big pussy. l'll catch ya - not!

42:12.375 --> 42:15.037
Didn't l say take a break?

42:15.111 --> 42:18.274
All right, doc. Then youjump!

42:18.347 --> 42:21.839
- Why do you want to help me?
- Because l'm the only one who can.

42:21.918 --> 42:26.480
Maybe it's my destiny. And maybe it's yours
to be the one tiger everybody remembers.

42:26.556 --> 42:32.358
- Why else would l be here talkin' to you?
- Cos the monkey can't keep his mouth shut.

42:32.462 --> 42:35.863
- Are you gonna let me help?
- What ifyou can't?

42:35.932 --> 42:40.266
- lf l can't help, you can eat me and Lucky.
- Yeah, orjust him.

42:40.336 --> 42:44.966
- Really? Will you take me back to the circus?
- l will take you back to the circus.

42:45.074 --> 42:49.340
All right. But don't think
l wasn't gonnajump, because l was.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.608
Hope you're a better doctor
than you are a singer.

42:53.716 --> 42:59.518
Good job, doc. Although seein'
a tigerjump five stories would've been cool.

42:59.589 --> 43:01.819
l heard that.

43:02.058 --> 43:02.091
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

43:02.091 --> 43:07.586
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

43:07.697 --> 43:11.758
You're not gonna believe what l got for us.
Corporate cars - every two years.

43:11.834 --> 43:14.325
Why aren't you paying attention to me?

43:14.403 --> 43:19.102
Atlas ofFeline Anatomyfor Veterinarians.
But, John, we treat humans.

43:19.175 --> 43:22.838
Hey, Mark, sit down a second. Just a minute.

43:22.945 --> 43:26.642
- OK.
- Do you remember when we started out?

43:26.749 --> 43:31.243
We had crummy offices in the worst
neighbourhood and got paid almost nothing.

43:31.354 --> 43:33.345
- l've blocked it out.
- Really?

43:33.523 --> 43:37.118
- l guess so, yeah.
- Those were the most exciting times to me.

43:37.193 --> 43:41.459
lt was like, you felt like
you were making a difference, you know?

43:41.564 --> 43:45.432
And last night l had to treat some...
some emergencies.

43:45.535 --> 43:48.402
And l was challenged, and it was difficult,

43:48.471 --> 43:51.269
and l got the same kind of rush
l had back then.

43:51.374 --> 43:54.810
l felt like l was doin' somethin',
like l was makin' a difference.

43:54.877 --> 44:01.043
And l started thinkin' that here l'm not giving
my patients the right amount of attention.

44:01.851 --> 44:06.345
Do me a favour. Don't confide in me.
l'm utterly useless. l'm very self-absorbed.

44:06.422 --> 44:08.481
Let's get Geno.

44:08.591 --> 44:10.456
Hey, Geno?

44:10.560 --> 44:14.792
You did yourjob just by pretending
you were listening. lt was very helpful.

44:14.864 --> 44:16.957
- Any time.
- OK.

44:18.067 --> 44:21.901
- Calnet, three o'clock.
- Three o'clock sharp.

44:30.513 --> 44:34.574
- This is Dr Fish.
- The author of Feline lllnesses andDiseases?

44:34.884 --> 44:37.045
Yes it is. You've read my book?

44:37.119 --> 44:41.613
Have l read your book? l sleep with
your book next to your bed. lt's my bible.

44:41.691 --> 44:46.890
Well, some people consider it
the definitive work on cats, but

44:46.996 --> 44:50.090
bible? l... l... l...

44:50.199 --> 44:52.599
Well, no, l can... l can see your point.

44:52.668 --> 44:57.105
Dr Fish, l have a very very sick,
very very big cat.

44:58.140 --> 45:01.871
l'm concerneditmightbe serious
because his vision's impaired.

45:01.944 --> 45:04.344
And he seems to be in a lot ofpain.

45:04.447 --> 45:08.474
Unfortunately,
ifitis in the head there's only two options.

45:08.551 --> 45:12.612
One is surgery
and the otheris putting it down.

45:14.557 --> 45:16.821
l have no idea how l'm gonna do this.

45:16.892 --> 45:21.955
- l'm gonna try to take care ofyou. l promise.
- Just hurry back.

45:22.064 --> 45:25.295
Every minute you're gone
l'm one minute closer to death.

45:25.434 --> 45:28.767
l just might hang myself by my underpants.

45:28.871 --> 45:31.135
l can get underpants.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.571
Not really.

45:32.675 --> 45:36.042
- He blew offthe Calloway meeting.
- l don't care about that.

45:36.112 --> 45:40.981
l need to speak with John.
You wouldn't believe what's goin' on here.

45:45.488 --> 45:47.285
Doc!

45:47.390 --> 45:50.518
You gotta help me. He's dead.
You gotta help me.

45:51.727 --> 45:54.890
- He's not dead.
- Oh, no, no, don't go, old buddy, old pal.

45:54.964 --> 45:57.990
- You gotta help him.
- Really? Why's that?

45:58.100 --> 46:01.263
Cos... cos... cos you're the man.
You're the man!

46:01.337 --> 46:04.397
Oh? l thought l was the guy
you wanted to get bubonic with.

46:04.507 --> 46:07.908
- l'm going towards the light now.
- l was kiddin'. We were riffin'.

46:07.977 --> 46:10.946
Serious? Come on!

46:11.013 --> 46:13.538
Goodbye, world. l smell flowers.

46:13.616 --> 46:16.881
l'm begging you. Don't let him die.
Don't let my buddy go.

46:16.952 --> 46:19.147
l'm sinking fast.

46:20.690 --> 46:22.885
- John...! Where have you been?
- Hi.

46:22.958 --> 46:24.892
- What?
- The meeting.

46:24.960 --> 46:27.588
l had an emergency. Excuse me. Sorry.

46:27.697 --> 46:29.528
Excuse you!

46:29.598 --> 46:32.726
- Hang in there, brother.
- Does it hurt when l do this?

46:32.802 --> 46:35.532
- lt ain't no day at the dump.
- lf he dies

46:35.604 --> 46:37.765
- l don't know what l'll do.
- He'll eat me.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.638
Only out of respect.

46:40.743 --> 46:43.337
Be quiet. l can't hear while you're talkin'.

46:43.446 --> 46:45.641
- Sorry, doc.
- John.

46:47.650 --> 46:50.346
He said he was suffering
from abdominal cramps.

46:51.020 --> 46:52.578
''He said''?

46:52.655 --> 46:56.716
l wouldn't be working on this rat
unless it was an emergency. Take a look.

46:58.794 --> 47:02.457
- What happened?
- He's gone into arrest. l don't feel a pulse.

47:02.565 --> 47:05.557
- Oh, my God, he's a goner.
- He's not breathing.

47:05.634 --> 47:08.068
- Johnny.
- Maybe we should shock him, huh?

47:08.170 --> 47:11.970
- l don't know.
- The paddles'll be too big. He needs CPR.

47:12.041 --> 47:15.636
- You know how to do CPR?
- l can't even spell it.

47:15.745 --> 47:19.146
- OK.
- l can't even look. Doc, no.

47:19.215 --> 47:21.683
- No, Johnny.
- For Chrissakes.

47:21.784 --> 47:26.949
You didn't even wine him or dine him, doc.
l think my friend would rather die.

47:27.022 --> 47:29.081
No tongue, doc.

47:30.693 --> 47:33.218
- Come on. l got no pulse.
- Doc, do somethin'.

47:33.295 --> 47:35.661
- John...
- Not now.

47:35.765 --> 47:38.097
- Honey...
- Lisa, please!

47:40.503 --> 47:42.164
l'm hungry.

47:42.238 --> 47:46.572
lt's a false alarm. There's nothing wrong
with him. He just has gas.

47:46.642 --> 47:49.702
- Whoa, you're telling me!
- He just had gas.

47:50.679 --> 47:54.115
You're back.
l don't care ifyou stink. l love ya, pal.

47:54.216 --> 47:57.674
Thanks a lot, little buddy. l felt your presence.

47:58.521 --> 48:01.820
Lisa, stop lookin' at me like that.

48:07.329 --> 48:09.524
John Dolittle.

48:10.299 --> 48:15.100
Who'd have ever thought
you would end up in a mental institution?

48:15.204 --> 48:18.332
Number one in our medical school class.

48:18.441 --> 48:23.071
Not that l'm jealous, John.
Someone had to finish first.

48:23.145 --> 48:26.137
And someone had to finish last too.

48:27.049 --> 48:30.314
So, John. You talk to animals now, do ya?

48:31.287 --> 48:35.314
Would you like to tell me about it?
Or would you rather tell Bettelheim?

48:36.325 --> 48:41.092
- l don't need to talk to your cat, Blain.
- Why? Do you think he'd talk back to you?

48:41.163 --> 48:44.929
- You know, he just might.
- And what would he say?

48:45.034 --> 48:47.366
l'd say you were a butthead.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.933
l really like this cat.

48:54.310 --> 48:57.643
He's recommending you stay
a minimum often days.

48:57.713 --> 49:01.740
You really think l need to be here
for that long?

49:02.785 --> 49:05.686
You said that you can talk to animals.

49:07.156 --> 49:09.386
You know, l can really hear 'em.

49:10.893 --> 49:13.088
l can.

49:13.162 --> 49:15.255
You gotta believe me.

49:16.699 --> 49:18.758
l can't.

49:27.743 --> 49:30.473
Here you go. Your medicine.

49:33.182 --> 49:34.911
OK, then.

49:37.887 --> 49:40.913
l can get you anything you need.
Saucers, coasters...

49:40.990 --> 49:42.514
Go away.

49:42.625 --> 49:45.219
lf you have any extra medication
l could use it.

49:45.327 --> 49:48.023
You're not following me, are you? Whoa.

49:49.431 --> 49:53.993
- Now, what is all this?
- This is to prove to me and the world

49:54.103 --> 49:56.435
that you can actually talk to animals.

49:56.539 --> 50:01.772
Now, the orang-utan is attached to
this brain-wave monitor.

50:02.344 --> 50:06.007
Normally he responds to
visual stimulation, but

50:06.115 --> 50:11.849
since you have got the gift of gab, you won't
need pictures to make him respond, will ya?

50:11.954 --> 50:14.514
Get acquainted, John.

50:15.824 --> 50:20.454
OK, listen. l need your help. l need you
to make that needle over there move,

50:20.563 --> 50:23.657
cos ifyou don't
they'll make me stay here for ever. OK?

50:23.766 --> 50:27.167
So just make the little needle jump.

50:28.971 --> 50:30.165
Come on.

50:30.239 --> 50:34.266
l know you can hear me now, so don't play.
This is very serious right now.

50:35.044 --> 50:37.979
l guess he's just not a big talker, John.

50:38.581 --> 50:42.415
Look, gimme a break. Say somethin', please.

50:51.994 --> 50:54.656
Please escort Dr Dolittle back to his room.

51:02.972 --> 51:05.702
Wait. You speak Spanish?

51:05.808 --> 51:09.437
That's why he couldn't understand.
He's from south ofthe border.

51:09.511 --> 51:13.709
- Remove him. Go.
- Turn that machine back on.

51:13.816 --> 51:15.579
Spanish...

51:19.989 --> 51:22.048
l'm worried, John.

51:22.124 --> 51:26.458
Who are you trying to fool?
You're worrying about Calnet.

51:26.862 --> 51:29.330
John l admit it.

51:29.431 --> 51:32.195
l want the money. l'm not ashamed ofthat.

51:32.267 --> 51:35.236
Look, here's what l want you to do for me.

51:35.304 --> 51:38.239
Just stop barking and chirping for one day.

51:38.307 --> 51:40.832
lf you do, l'm pretty sure
you can get out of here.

51:40.909 --> 51:43.275
And that'd be a really good idea,

51:43.345 --> 51:48.942
because Calloway said ifyou're not back
for Friday's press conference, the deal's off.

51:49.051 --> 51:53.750
lf you would do that for me, Johnny,
l'll buy you a rat farm.

51:53.856 --> 51:58.623
And you can... you can burp and fart
the little rats till you pass out.

51:58.727 --> 52:02.254
But let's just get it signed. OK, my shot.

52:09.471 --> 52:11.735
Pick it up. Pick the phone up, please.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.241
Hi. We're nothere. Leave a message.

52:15.310 --> 52:17.369
Hey. Hi, it's me.

52:19.481 --> 52:22.314
l'm really startin' to miss you guys.

52:22.384 --> 52:25.785
l'm startin' to wonder what l'm doin' here too.

52:25.888 --> 52:28.914
Maybe you were right.
Maybe it was all my imagination.

52:28.991 --> 52:31.323
- Hey, honey, feelin' better?
- Who's this?

52:31.393 --> 52:35.853
l'll give you a hint. l'm cute, l'm furry
and l make 500 babies a year.

52:36.298 --> 52:38.357
Rodney. Get back in your cage.

52:38.467 --> 52:41.994
What's up with that trap behind the fridge?
You tryin' to kill me?

52:42.104 --> 52:45.335
Never mind that.
Get your little furry ass back in your cage.

52:45.407 --> 52:47.875
Now. l don't want your droppings on...

52:48.711 --> 52:50.576
Bye-bye.

52:50.679 --> 52:53.580
My son Rodney.
Little hairy boy, sleeps in the cage.

52:53.682 --> 52:57.709
l have to keep him in the cage
cos he has hygiene problems.

52:58.420 --> 53:00.513
He's not coming back.

53:01.023 --> 53:03.958
l can't believe l fell for it.

53:04.493 --> 53:08.395
- Oh, boy, l'm getting dizzy.
- Man, you don't look so good.

53:08.497 --> 53:11.364
Look who's talking!
What do the three ofyou know?

53:12.801 --> 53:14.894
l'm in bad shape.

53:15.804 --> 53:17.328
My head!

53:17.406 --> 53:19.533
What kind ofa name is Edfora horse?

53:19.608 --> 53:22.600
What kind ofa name is Wilburfora man?

53:22.711 --> 53:26.112
Peanut butter. That's how they
got the horse to move his lips.

53:26.181 --> 53:29.207
- ln the back ofthe mouth.
- l disagree, sir.

53:29.318 --> 53:31.752
- Side. The side.
- Look, look. See his jaw?

53:31.854 --> 53:34.152
- See? See?
- The oesophagus, yes.

53:34.223 --> 53:37.124
- He's not talking. That's an act.
- No, no, no.

53:41.597 --> 53:44.031
Finish what you were talking about.

53:44.133 --> 53:46.863
- No, he's...
- Full teeth. Full teeth.

53:46.969 --> 53:48.561
Doc. Out here.

53:48.637 --> 53:50.832
Doc. Hey, over here.

53:57.980 --> 54:00.141
What are you doin' here?

54:00.215 --> 54:05.278
l crossed three freeways to rescue you,
and all l get is ''What are you doing here?''

54:05.754 --> 54:09.087
- This isn't a prison. lt's a clinic.
- The tiger's in bad shape.

54:09.191 --> 54:11.785
The tiger? Listen, forget the tiger.

54:11.894 --> 54:15.762
l had a perfect life until you came along
and started talkin' to me.

54:15.864 --> 54:19.095
Now l'm sittin' here in a robe
discussin' Mr Ed with these guys.

54:19.201 --> 54:22.193
You've ruined my life enough. Just go away.

54:22.271 --> 54:24.705
Just get outta here, please. This is crazy.

54:25.007 --> 54:28.033
l get it.
Now it's crazy to want to save a tiger's life.

54:28.110 --> 54:30.840
Listen, tigers die every day.
lt's called nature.

54:30.913 --> 54:35.179
Let me tell you a little about nature.
l'm a dog, and l act like a dog.

54:35.250 --> 54:37.878
l don't try to be anybody else.
We are who we are.

54:37.986 --> 54:42.389
And you are a doctor who can talk to animals.
That's who you are.

54:42.457 --> 54:45.426
- That is not who l am.
- Stop lying to yourself.

54:45.494 --> 54:48.622
Didn't l tell you to get outta here?
Go. Get outta here.

54:48.697 --> 54:50.460
- Get outta here.
- Fine.

54:50.532 --> 54:53.399
- Stop talkin' to me.
- With pleasure.

54:53.468 --> 54:56.301
You better not come back.

54:56.905 --> 54:59.203
- Bonehead.
- That's all ofyou.

54:59.675 --> 55:02.041
Leave me alone. Stop talkin' to me.

55:02.110 --> 55:04.670
Ruined his life. That's a laugh.

55:24.900 --> 55:29.894
- OK, Blain, look. l wanna go home.
- So soon? And miss the field trip to the zoo?

55:30.472 --> 55:33.305
Listen.
You've hated me since medical school,

55:33.375 --> 55:36.310
but we are both adults now.
Let's put that behind us.

55:36.378 --> 55:39.711
We both have families.
l want to get back to mine. How do l do that?

55:39.781 --> 55:44.275
Well, it's very simple.
Stop talking to animals, John.

55:44.353 --> 55:45.445
Simple.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.455
All right, listen.
You're right. l made a mistake.

55:48.523 --> 55:54.120
Maybe it was a case oftemporary insanity,
but it's over. l don't talk to animals any more.

55:55.530 --> 56:00.331
l'm not convinced.
We'll talk again in a month or so, OK?

56:01.336 --> 56:04.169
Tell you what, Blain.
You sign my release form

56:04.273 --> 56:09.267
and l won't tell our fellow-doctor friends
about that pink tutu you keep in your closet.

56:09.344 --> 56:11.972
With the thong back.

56:22.090 --> 56:24.718
- Daddy's home.
- Daddy? Hey, Daddy.

56:24.793 --> 56:28.695
- Hey, beautiful, how are you?
- Oh, l'm fine.

56:28.764 --> 56:31.130
- Hey, baby.
- Wh...?

56:31.767 --> 56:35.726
- Why didn't you call me?
- l wanted to surprise you.

56:35.804 --> 56:40.002
- Hey, why aren't you in camp, young lady?
- Mom brought her home.

56:41.043 --> 56:43.910
l didn't fit in.

56:45.580 --> 56:49.812
You're just gonna have to try a little harder
next year. Gimme a hug. l missed you.

56:49.918 --> 56:52.409
- Still Daddy's baby, huh?
- Honey?

56:52.521 --> 56:54.921
Do they know that you left?

56:55.023 --> 57:00.017
No, l escaped. Of course they know l left.
l'm better. Time to spend some time with you.

57:00.862 --> 57:03.023
Are you not talkin' to me?

57:03.131 --> 57:05.725
- You're sure you're OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

57:05.801 --> 57:09.168
Cos l got scared,
wonderin' when you were comin' home.

57:09.638 --> 57:14.405
Well, l am back and l'm fine, and everything's
gonna be just like it was in the old days.

57:14.476 --> 57:19.072
l know what you're doin'. Two can play at
that game. l don't have to listen to you either.

57:19.181 --> 57:22.150
l was thinkin' maybe
we should get rid ofthat dog.

57:22.217 --> 57:27.450
Comin' home empty-handed...! Don't tell me
there wasn't a gift shop at the loony bin.

57:28.156 --> 57:32.183
Diane, please call down to Radiology
and get me the x-rays on Mr Galvin.

57:32.260 --> 57:36.094
Also, see if Mrs Rivers
can switch her appointment to 3.15.

57:36.198 --> 57:39.099
- l may need Gene for a consultation.
- Yes, Doctor.

57:39.468 --> 57:43.427
Gene can you check your schedule
and see ifyou can do a 3.15 consult?

57:43.505 --> 57:45.439
- Sure.
- Good. And Mark.

57:45.507 --> 57:49.773
- Did you get back the tests on Mr Freeman?
- l think they're comin' in this afternoon.

57:49.845 --> 57:52.780
Good. Keep me informed, OK?

57:52.848 --> 57:56.443
Hey, doc, do you think
l should get my beak done?

57:58.687 --> 58:02.646
Tell Maintenance we need to put some
permanent screens up, set some traps.

58:02.724 --> 58:06.285
This is a doctor's office, not a zoo.

58:06.395 --> 58:09.091
He's back. We're gonna be rich.

58:12.534 --> 58:17.335
This is where he lives,
and this is where he exercises.

58:17.439 --> 58:21.432
- Does he do aerobics?
- Yeah, the guinea pig aerobics.

58:21.510 --> 58:26.345
Let's get this show on the road. Put that thing
away. You're gonna get your dress dirty.

58:26.448 --> 58:28.541
Pop, help out. l can't be late for this.

58:28.650 --> 58:31.619
- But Rodney wants to come.
- Rodney cannot come.

58:31.686 --> 58:34.883
This is a press conference for people.
No animals allowed.

58:34.956 --> 58:39.325
- Why don't you tell him? He'll listen to you.
- No, l am not going to tell him.

58:43.432 --> 58:45.957
Help out.

58:47.369 --> 58:48.893
Come on, Pop.

58:48.970 --> 58:51.564
- Can l tell you a secret?
- Yes.

58:52.941 --> 58:57.469
When Mommy told me what happened
to Daddy, l wasn't afraid - l was happy.

58:57.546 --> 59:00.947
Because l believed
that he can talk to animals.

59:01.049 --> 59:04.143
Cos l wanted Dad to be weird. Like me.

59:04.252 --> 59:07.346
- ls that wrong?
- No. No, it's not wrong.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.323
lt's just, sometimes
l don't think he likes me much.

59:10.759 --> 59:13.887
Honey, he loves you.

59:14.262 --> 59:17.720
l know he loves me. l don't think he likes me.

59:18.767 --> 59:21.167
And l really want him to.

59:21.269 --> 59:23.499
l'm gonna try to do things his way.

59:24.539 --> 59:27.667
And stop doing these stupid experiments.

59:29.878 --> 59:31.937
No, Maya.

59:32.781 --> 59:35.011
Don't stop your experiments.

59:36.184 --> 59:41.144
Sometimes daddies are the ones
who need to change.

59:53.902 --> 59:58.965
- Let me park this car.
- All right. Come on, girls. Let's go.

59:59.441 --> 01:00:01.909
Maya. Let me talk to you a second.

01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:05.174
- We'll be in there in a second.
- OK.

01:00:05.247 --> 01:00:07.340
Hey, listen.

01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:11.216
l don't think your egg is a stupid idea.
lt's kinda cool.

01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:13.048
- You do?
- Yes.

01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:16.749
You have curiosity and ideas,
and that's what makes you special.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:20.261
- You mean weird.
- l didn't say weird. l said special.

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:27.026
Being weird's not so bad. A lot ofthe greatest
people in history were considered weird.

01:00:27.169 --> 01:00:30.229
- Like who?
- Lots of people. Albert Einstein.

01:00:30.338 --> 01:00:35.571
With his crazy hair, people thought he was
weird. A guy that smart was weird to people.

01:00:35.644 --> 01:00:39.410
Muhammad Ali, when he said what round
he was gonna knock out people in

01:00:39.481 --> 01:00:43.611
and screamed ''l'm the greatest.''
People thought that was super-weird.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:47.348
- And Joan ofArc, she heard voices.
- Like you, Daddy?

01:00:49.591 --> 01:00:51.650
Yeah, like me.

01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:57.793
Listen, this is what l'm tryin' to tell you.
No matter what happens, you be who you are.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:00.198
And you love who you are.

01:01:01.236 --> 01:01:03.295
Cos l love you.

01:01:05.674 --> 01:01:07.801
Gimme a kiss.

01:01:09.244 --> 01:01:09.835
Yes.

01:01:09.911 --> 01:01:13.005
- You know, you're a great person.
- Oh, thank you.

01:01:13.081 --> 01:01:16.073
And a weird one too.

01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:18.686
- See you inside.
- OK.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.297
That was beautiful, man.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.892
- Lucky! What are you doin' here?
- Do you have a tissue?

01:01:36.004 --> 01:01:39.337
Yes, l do.
Right in the back in that pocket over there.

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:42.137
Listen. l'm sorry l ignored you
back at the house.

01:01:44.145 --> 01:01:47.114
You were the one who said
''Be who you are.'' You were right.

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:53.415
Put me back in touch with the part of me
that l'd forgotten years ago, Lucky.

01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:57.881
Can you take it easy?
l'm tryin' to say somethin'.

01:01:57.959 --> 01:02:01.451
- Well, then just say it.
- l'm trying to say it.

01:02:01.529 --> 01:02:04.657
- What do you think l'm tryin' to say?
- ''l love you, Lucky.''

01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:07.293
- That's not what l'm tryin' to say.
- Yes, it is.

01:02:07.369 --> 01:02:09.462
That is not what l'm tryin' to tell you.

01:02:09.537 --> 01:02:13.268
Come on. Deep down inside
that's exactly what you want to say.

01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:16.276
Come on, now.
You'll feel a lot better. Come on.

01:02:16.344 --> 01:02:19.711
Let it out. Go ahead. You know it. l know it.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:22.375
- l love you.
- You love me?

01:02:23.518 --> 01:02:25.645
l'm gonna need another tissue.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.917
- Where are we offto?
- We are offto ruin my life.

01:02:31.526 --> 01:02:34.086
Wake up!

01:02:35.063 --> 01:02:37.930
Hey, doc. You came back.

01:02:38.566 --> 01:02:40.761
You need help. l wanna take you for tests.

01:02:40.869 --> 01:02:44.999
- Tests? That's good, right? Tests?
- Yeah. Come on.

01:02:46.941 --> 01:02:49.102
l hate these stairs.

01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:52.407
Take good care of him, doc. He's our star.

01:02:52.514 --> 01:02:54.311
He'll be OK.

01:02:54.382 --> 01:02:56.577
- Great. More steps.
- Come on. Get in.

01:02:58.386 --> 01:03:01.947
Wait a minute. The dog gets to ride up front?

01:03:02.023 --> 01:03:06.187
- Stop looking at me like l'm a side dish.
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:03:06.328 --> 01:03:09.354
- Now, you two guys shut up. Quiet.
- Hey, look. Jerry.

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:12.025
- Can you keep your voice down?
- He's a big fan.

01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:16.729
Hey, Jerry. How you doin', dude?
Just goin' for some tests.

01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:21.231
l'm fine! ''The tiger's fine.'' l'm sick.

01:03:22.644 --> 01:03:25.909
- l told you they'd get away.
- No thanks to you.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.848
No? Three armed guards
versus a pigeon - that's a fair fight?

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.388
He's not at home and he's not
answering his pager. l'm worried.

01:03:36.925 --> 01:03:38.358
- Mom.
- Yes?

01:03:38.426 --> 01:03:41.554
Guess who Maya brought to the party.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.464
Rodney. Rodney, there you are.

01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:48.264
- Man...
- Where the hell is Dolittle?

01:03:48.403 --> 01:03:53.238
You know, l just talked to him. He stopped
at an orphanage to take care of a sick child.

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.175
That is so John. lt's so typical ofthe man.
He just cares.

01:03:57.245 --> 01:04:03.480
Weller. Take your lips off my butt
long enough to hear what l'm going to say.

01:04:03.585 --> 01:04:07.783
lf Dolittle's not here in ten minutes,

01:04:07.856 --> 01:04:10.222
- l'm pulling the plug.
- You won't have to.

01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.657
He's gonna be here in five minutes.

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:17.198
- l hope so.
- He will be. He'll be here in five minutes.

01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:21.058
Hey.

01:04:21.169 --> 01:04:25.401
Where's the kitchenette? l gotta get in here.
Where's the food?

01:04:26.608 --> 01:04:29.634
- Rodney.
- She's comin' to get me.

01:04:30.278 --> 01:04:32.405
Rodney.

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:44.119
- Who's Rodney?
- Sorry.

01:04:49.297 --> 01:04:53.495
This ain't no kitchen. Smell bad.
Must be cookin' chitlins.

01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:59.065
Now what's this for?

01:05:01.743 --> 01:05:03.836
Somebody help me.

01:05:08.049 --> 01:05:10.108
l can't swim.

01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:14.652
Aaaggghhh yourself!

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:24.430
Where you goin'? Get me outta here.

01:05:27.902 --> 01:05:33.738
Somebody get the license plate number.
l have just been violated.

01:05:43.952 --> 01:05:47.649
- This is where you work?
- Come on.

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:56.954
Don't throw that away. That's
the marrow - it's the best part ofthe bone.

01:05:58.132 --> 01:06:01.693
- Look who's here.
- Well, if it isn't Siegfried and Roy!

01:06:01.769 --> 01:06:02.929
Quiet.

01:06:03.004 --> 01:06:06.667
- Lucky, keep an eye out. You rats help him.
- We don't work for you.

01:06:06.741 --> 01:06:10.336
- Gimme a break. l saved your life.
- That's yesterday's news.

01:06:11.312 --> 01:06:13.371
You want gratitude, get a hamster.

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:16.882
''Get a hamster.'' You kill me!

01:06:16.951 --> 01:06:18.578
l gotta get help.

01:06:18.686 --> 01:06:21.621
Yeah, l got a plate lD on the catnapper.

01:06:21.723 --> 01:06:23.588
Do something.

01:06:23.691 --> 01:06:26.683
The heart of a hawk.
The heart of a hawk.

01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:30.629
- A chicken hawk
- The heart of a hawk.

01:06:41.242 --> 01:06:43.972
That feels good.

01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:48.379
l enjoy my personal relationships
with my patients.

01:06:48.516 --> 01:06:51.041
- You'll get over that.
- l just might not.

01:06:51.152 --> 01:06:53.313
l'm joking. Gene, l'm...

01:06:54.722 --> 01:07:00.820
This is the kind of guy who would rather be
trudging through the snow with a black bag

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:03.659
- makin' house calls.
- Exactly.

01:07:05.433 --> 01:07:08.061
- That hurt me.
- Oh, my gosh, l'm sorry.

01:07:08.169 --> 01:07:11.036
- l may have broken my nose.
- l think l broke his nose.

01:07:11.139 --> 01:07:13.334
- ls it broken?
- Let me check.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:16.434
Oh, my God! l broke his nose.

01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:20.570
- Let me take him to X-ray.
- l'm blackin' out.

01:07:29.857 --> 01:07:36.023
Thaaaat feeeeels goooood!

01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:39.999
- This really hurts. l think...
- Of course it hurts.

01:07:40.068 --> 01:07:42.263
You walked right into a door.

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:44.463
Oh, God, l'm bleeding.

01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:47.803
l'm bleeding.
Do we have any morphine in the vault?

01:07:47.875 --> 01:07:50.002
- Hey, guys.
- John.

01:07:50.378 --> 01:07:52.778
- What happened to you?
- l walked into a door.

01:07:52.847 --> 01:07:55.179
- l crushed his septum.
- Really?

01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:58.685
Look, this is not really a good time.
l'm kinda

01:07:58.786 --> 01:08:00.879
- here with somebody.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:04.857
l-l-l do not approve.
Lisa is a wonderful woman!

01:08:06.828 --> 01:08:08.261
- Jesus.
- lt's OK.

01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:10.422
- lt's a friggin' tiger.
- He won't hurt you.

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.830
- l know him.
- Be afraid. Be very afraid.

01:08:14.902 --> 01:08:17.393
Oh, my goodness. l have to sit.

01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:23.308
Here's what we do. We tell Johnny
we're gonna fix his little tiger up

01:08:23.411 --> 01:08:25.504
after he signs. OK?

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:29.743
Then we'll have him committed.
lt's perfect! That way we get our money.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:39.118
lt's shifted to the left.
So there's something applying pressure to it.

01:08:39.227 --> 01:08:43.425
You can't operate on a tiger.
Especially as you don't know the symptoms.

01:08:43.497 --> 01:08:48.060
- Double vision and headaches. He told me.
- You'll wind up back at Hammersmith's.

01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:50.069
l've been supportive,

01:08:50.138 --> 01:08:53.904
but ifyou expect me to believe
that a tiger told you his symptoms,

01:08:54.308 --> 01:08:56.537
l might have to draw the line.

01:08:58.645 --> 01:09:01.136
You have to do something. Quick.

01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:04.548
We gotta get him into OR fast.
lt's the only chance he's got.

01:09:04.685 --> 01:09:07.779
What about the press conference?

01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:10.288
20 bucks says this guy never shows.

01:09:10.358 --> 01:09:13.657
Watch your back.
Trying to get to the operating room.

01:09:13.728 --> 01:09:19.359
- Outta the way, please.
- Clear a spot. We have an emergency here.

01:09:19.466 --> 01:09:22.095
Clear the way, please. Comin' through.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:26.538
- There you are. Let's do this.
- Mr Calloway, Mark broke his nose.

01:09:26.674 --> 01:09:30.770
- The nose can wait. The press is waiting.
- l-l-l-l...

01:09:30.877 --> 01:09:35.314
- We're announcing.
- l really don't know ifwe should...

01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:38.578
- Where were you?
- l'll explain.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.589
Thank you all for coming,
and thank you all for being so patient.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:48.354
As you all know, the practice of medicine
and the business of medicine

01:09:48.429 --> 01:09:52.091
have been undergoing
very big changes in this country.

01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:56.227
We at Calnet strive to be
at the forefront ofthese changes.

01:09:56.337 --> 01:09:59.898
That is why l'm proud to announce
the acquisition of...

01:09:59.974 --> 01:10:04.138
This is the life! Hot wings, nuts.
l love nuts.

01:10:05.046 --> 01:10:08.709
Oh, my! Live prey.

01:10:15.056 --> 01:10:19.459
- That's a big cat!
- lt's all right. lt's OK.

01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:22.521
lt's OK. He's not gonna hurt anybody.

01:10:23.998 --> 01:10:26.057
He's just a very, very sick tiger.

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:29.261
You'd better have a rational
explanation for all this.

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:34.569
Mr Calloway, l don't have a rational
explanation. l wish l did, but l don't.

01:10:34.842 --> 01:10:39.370
Right now l got a sick tiger on my hands. l'm
gonna try to save it. That's all that matters.

01:10:39.447 --> 01:10:41.608
Dolittle, you go through with this...

01:10:46.154 --> 01:10:48.486
So ifyou'll excuse me...

01:10:50.224 --> 01:10:52.988
- Stupid cat. Ruined the party.
- Shut up.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.893
What do you mean, shut up?
l was gonna do karaoke!

01:11:10.077 --> 01:11:12.807
What the hell is this?

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.713
- No more bacon.
- One, two, three, four.

01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:18.911
You ain't gettin' through this door.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.113
Make love, not war.

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:24.784
Fur is murder. Free Willy.

01:11:24.859 --> 01:11:29.262
Pigs go home. Pigs go home. Pigs go home.

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:30.627
Huh?

01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:33.131
No, no, not you. The police.

01:11:33.234 --> 01:11:35.464
Wow, this is great.

01:11:35.536 --> 01:11:38.903
- Are you OK?
- The man's comin' down hard, but

01:11:39.006 --> 01:11:42.533
- we're holdin' strong.
- l got such a chill.

01:11:42.643 --> 01:11:45.669
l'm gonna give you a local.
lt's not gonna hurt.

01:11:45.813 --> 01:11:48.304
lt'll feel like a little bee sting.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:51.852
A little pressure. That's about it.

01:11:51.919 --> 01:11:54.012
OK? Here l come.

01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:57.514
There you go.

01:11:57.758 --> 01:11:59.692
He can't do this.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.130
- He still thinks he can talk to animals.
- He can, Lisa. He can talk to animals.

01:12:05.233 --> 01:12:08.464
lt all started when he was a kid.
l didn't know what to do.

01:12:08.536 --> 01:12:11.903
- What are you saying, Dad?
- l thought it was a handicap,

01:12:11.973 --> 01:12:14.066
but it's a gift, Lisa.

01:12:14.141 --> 01:12:17.269
Don't you believe it? Look. See for yourself.

01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:26.517
l need you to stay alert and tell me ifyou feel
numbness in your paws or on your right side.

01:12:26.587 --> 01:12:30.853
Have you ever done this operation before?

01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:33.325
Yeah, once in medical school.

01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:35.658
But it was to a cadaver.

01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.723
My professor told me that had my patient
not been dead, he would have lived.

01:12:40.167 --> 01:12:42.397
Very comforting, doc.

01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:53.343
lt's like Noah's ark out here.
lt truly is a remarkable sight.

01:12:53.414 --> 01:12:59.148
This collection of animals has prevented San
Francisco's finest from entering the building.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.519
Which is apparently
where the stolen tiger is being held.

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:02.723
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

01:13:02.723 --> 01:13:06.090
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

01:13:10.231 --> 01:13:14.429
All right, Jake, l need you to be alert.
Tell me ifyou feel anything at all.

01:13:14.535 --> 01:13:16.628
- Can you feel anything now?
- No.

01:13:16.737 --> 01:13:18.830
Just the same old pain.

01:13:20.174 --> 01:13:24.133
How about now?
You feeling any numbness at all?

01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:27.408
l... l can't. l don't know!

01:13:27.515 --> 01:13:30.382
Just relax and listen to
the sound of my voice, OK?

01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:34.785
- l'm scared.
- Don't be scared. l'm not gonna let you go.

01:13:34.922 --> 01:13:36.981
John?

01:13:38.993 --> 01:13:42.986
- What did he say?
- He said he's a little scared.

01:14:25.473 --> 01:14:28.772
Pulse is dropping fast.

01:14:28.843 --> 01:14:32.973
His dura is bulging.
There's too much pressure.

01:14:33.047 --> 01:14:35.607
- My left side went numb.
- Pulse still dropping.

01:14:35.683 --> 01:14:39.619
All right. Hey, you just hang in there,
OK, Jacob? Hang in there for me.

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:42.815
- OK, doc.
- lt's a blood clot. lt has to be.

01:14:42.923 --> 01:14:47.383
All l gotta do is find it. We're too close
to his motor strip. More suction, Gene.

01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:50.794
- We're losin' him. We gotta relieve pressure.
- Come on, Jake.

01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:55.325
- Don't let go yet. We're almost there.
- l can feel it.

01:14:55.436 --> 01:14:57.267
- There.
- There?

01:14:57.338 --> 01:14:59.738
OK. OK, here we go.

01:15:05.312 --> 01:15:08.145
lt's gone. The pain is gone.

01:15:08.249 --> 01:15:11.446
Blood pressure stabilising.

01:15:11.519 --> 01:15:14.818
lt's gone. lt's really gone.

01:15:15.122 --> 01:15:17.682
He's OK.

01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:27.726
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome.

01:15:27.835 --> 01:15:32.636
You just lay back and relax. We're gonna
have you back in the centre ring in no time.

01:15:37.845 --> 01:15:39.710
Why'd you do that?

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.716
lf he tries to eat me again, l'm gonna
smack that moustache offyour face.

01:15:47.488 --> 01:15:51.185
He's a lunatic.
He has a history of mental illness.

01:15:51.292 --> 01:15:53.385
- He's frankly...
- He's the most

01:15:53.494 --> 01:15:58.397
- remarkable surgeon l have ever seen.
- He's here to stay.

01:15:58.499 --> 01:16:02.799
- He is the straw that stirs the drink.
- l want exclusive rights to him.

01:16:02.903 --> 01:16:05.599
He's dynamic, caring. l can't imagine...

01:16:05.706 --> 01:16:08.504
- What's the matter?
- Dolittle. Wonderful work.

01:16:08.576 --> 01:16:12.672
- Bravo. Bravo, Johnny. l'm so inspired.
- Welcome aboard.

01:16:12.746 --> 01:16:16.739
- l feel like l bought a winning franchise.
- Yeah.

01:16:17.151 --> 01:16:20.416
You haven't bought anything.
We're not for sale.

01:16:20.588 --> 01:16:25.525
Look. We don't need these namby-pamby
wacko freaks. lt's you and me,

01:16:26.093 --> 01:16:30.120
- straight to the top.
- You want pigeon? You'll get pigeon.

01:16:35.836 --> 01:16:40.637
- Are ya happy now?
- l'm right behind ya.

01:16:50.117 --> 01:16:52.415
Hey. Somebody come here.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.114
l think we got birth here.

01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:58.852
Hey, hey! Somebody!
l see some shakin' in that egg.

01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:01.154
l see shakin' in the egg.

01:17:01.228 --> 01:17:03.719
Hey, how's it goin', McGruff?

01:17:03.797 --> 01:17:06.197
You know what? A Tic Tac wouldn't kill you.

01:17:06.267 --> 01:17:09.395
Hey, girl, get up. We got birth comin'.

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.597
A swan egg. This is gonna be great.

01:17:11.672 --> 01:17:14.163
- Come on, girl.
- One question. What is a swan?

01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:16.971
- That's my egg hatching.
- OK, just breathe.

01:17:17.077 --> 01:17:20.069
Yeah, here it come, the magic moment.

01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:23.548
Oh, no. Just like Jurassic Park.
lt's gonna kill us.

01:17:23.617 --> 01:17:26.347
My swan egg's hatching. lt's hatching. lt...

01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:31.150
Good lord, doc. What on earth is that?

01:17:31.692 --> 01:17:35.355
That would be Maya's
brand-new baby alligator.

01:17:35.429 --> 01:17:37.294
Cool.

01:17:37.398 --> 01:17:39.832
- Momma?
- Momma? l'm not your momma.

01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:45.164
- Momma?
- Oh, no, don't look at me.

01:17:45.239 --> 01:17:49.801
Although there was that one time
l got drunk in the Everglades...

01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:52.501
Doc, wait up.

01:17:52.613 --> 01:17:55.446
So, you're gonna treat humans andanimals.
l love it.

01:17:55.516 --> 01:17:58.178
lt's no big thing. We're all basically the same.

01:17:58.252 --> 01:18:02.279
My thoughts exactly. First l want to
move my bowl up on the dining-room table.

01:18:02.389 --> 01:18:05.381
Second, no more dog food.
That stuff's just gross.

01:18:05.459 --> 01:18:08.724
l want my own room, with a TV.
Basic cable will be fine.

01:18:09.029 --> 01:18:11.998
l hate stories with happy endings.

01:18:12.099 --> 01:18:13.896
- Yoo-hoo.
- What?

01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:17.129
- l didn't say nothin'.
- Then who...?

01:18:17.238 --> 01:18:21.106
Run for your lives.
Oh, my God. l don't wanna die.

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:24.109
Hang a left. No, hang a right.

01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:30.275
- Legs, do your thing. Outta my way.
- This circle of life really stinks.
