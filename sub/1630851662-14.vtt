WEBVTT

00:44.961 --> 00:47.630
- You okay?
- It is hard.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.508
We have done our duty.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.218
Notified Conner's friends
and family,

00:52.302 --> 00:54.804
attended multiple
memorial services,

00:54.888 --> 00:56.514
and the lighting
of this hologram.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.018
Yet, it still does not
seem real.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.937
Maybe you need to
take a moment to process.

01:03.021 --> 01:07.025
You know, when Tula died,
you never had time to mourn.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.195
Instead, you immediately went
undercover with Black Manta.

01:10.195 --> 01:13.364
And when Wally died,
I was a total jerk,

01:13.448 --> 01:15.033
and dumped the whole team
on you,

01:15.033 --> 01:17.744
not thinking about
your grief at all.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.703
I understood.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.913
And Aquaman resigned,

01:19.913 --> 01:21.873
and you not only took up
his mantle,

01:21.873 --> 01:26.085
but lead the Justice League
through some of
its darkest hours.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.254
And now Conner?

01:28.338 --> 01:32.509
Kaldur, you've always been
the leader, the adult,

01:32.509 --> 01:35.345
the rock we all lean on,

01:35.345 --> 01:37.639
but maybe you need to
take a break,

01:37.639 --> 01:39.724
before all this breaks you.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.647
No, I will be fine.
I have to be.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.232
Thank you for your concern,

01:47.232 --> 01:49.567
but I have
a conference tomorrow
in Poseidonis

01:49.651 --> 01:51.110
which I must prepare for.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.921
Delegates of
the great city-states
of Atlantis,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.548
I welcome you to
the opening ceremonies

03:35.632 --> 03:37.800
of our annual conference.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.053
Since we have new faces here,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.221
allow me to introduce
my cabinet.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.016
Mera Nereus, Princess of Xebel,

03:45.016 --> 03:46.476
Queen of Atlantis,

03:46.476 --> 03:49.187
Headmistress of
the Conservatory of Sorcery,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.314
and Minister of Magic.

03:51.314 --> 03:55.151
Vulko of Poseidonis,
Minister of Science.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.988
Commander Ondine of Poseidonis,
Minister of Security.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.992
Garth of Crastinus,
Minister of Diplomacy.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.495
And Kaldur'ahm of Shayeris,

04:05.495 --> 04:07.538
Aquaman of the Justice League,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.791
and Minister of Justice.

04:09.791 --> 04:13.086
And now, if the delegates
would be so kind.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.548
I am Lord Ronal of Crastinus
in the Arctic Ocean.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.135
Prime Minister Topo
of Lemuria
in the North Pacific.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.305
Emissary Coral of Neptunos
in the South Pacific.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.349
I am Nanaue Sha'ark,

04:26.349 --> 04:29.686
King of Nanauve
and the Southern Ocean.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.356
General Lori Lemaris
of Tritonis
in the Indian Ocean.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.276
First Citizen Calvin Durham
of Shayeris
in the North Atlantic.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.405
And from Xebel
in the South Atlantic,

04:40.405 --> 04:41.864
no one.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.950
Xebel insults us
with this absence.
I'm leaving.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.286
Seems a shame to depart
without accomplishing anything.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.749
My friends, I am certain
the delegate from Xebel
will join us

04:51.833 --> 04:54.419
by the time
the conference proper
begins tomorrow.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.714
We did have plans for this day,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.216
but let us adjourn.

05:00.216 --> 05:04.554
We invite you all to
sample the pleasures
of Poseidonis.

05:04.554 --> 05:10.351
See how Orin
flaunts the wealth
of Poseidonis to shame us.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.270
You must contact
your father again.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.480
He must send someone.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.607
Anyone who can be here
by tomorrow.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.318
I will try.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.989
Artur, help me.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.907
I'm completely surrounded.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.492
Never fear, La'gaan.

05:26.576 --> 05:31.581
Aquaboy will save you.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.459
Neptune's beard.
You saved me, Aquaboy.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.002
You're a hero.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.839
Hi.
How did it go?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.091
As expected.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.427
And, as expected,

05:44.427 --> 05:48.598
you are going to be
a wonderful father.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.141
You'll do all right.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.271
We appreciate you keeping
an eye on the prince.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.106
He was keeping an eye on me.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.359
Aquaboy keeps his eyes
on everyone.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.322
I will see you
back at the palace.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.157
Where's Mother going?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.950
To talk to your grandfather.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.204
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, indeed. Come on.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.042
- Up for a night on the town?
- A short one.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.920
- I get tired.
- Lori, General Lemaris, wait.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.256
- You are off duty?
- For the night, yes.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.800
A year ago,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.886
I never would have believed
I could have this life.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.721
What say
you show Delphis around?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.640
She rarely gets to
see Poseidonis.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.268
Uh, Sha'lain'a, I'm sure
Kaldur and Wyynde...

06:34.352 --> 06:37.396
- Would love to host you.
- It would be our pleasure.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.497
Always.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.215
Whoa, that bomb really
knocked me for a loop.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.301
M'gann?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.096
M'gann, where are you?

07:11.430 --> 07:12.306
Uh...

07:13.266 --> 07:14.517
Or where am I?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.270
M'gann.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.066
Our mental link... is severed.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.530
Hey... Hey, are you okay?

07:30.783 --> 07:31.742
Ma'al.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.839
No heat signatures
for either of us.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.010
That's impossible. Unless...

07:50.469 --> 07:51.804
Are we dead?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.979
Ah, this is amazing.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.482
Poseidonis is so much shinier
than Shayeris.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.821
That is one source of trouble
between the city-states,
is it not?

08:08.905 --> 08:12.617
The conflict between the haves
and have nots?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.119
Mm, I saw the same thing
in Mumbai.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.954
Indeed. Bridging those gaps

08:17.038 --> 08:18.789
is one of King Orin's
greatest challenges.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.626
Save politics
for the conference.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.919
Algae, anyone?

08:28.466 --> 08:31.594
Three orders of Black Gold. Enjoy.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.888
Thank you, Minkis. We will.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.098
Uh, how do I...

08:36.182 --> 08:38.768
Simply squeeze and chew.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.397
Whoa! It's good.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.607
Go easy.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.359
Wyynde always orders
the hard stuff.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.611
Why bother with anything else?

08:48.611 --> 08:53.449
It is still hilarious
that one can get drunk
on algae.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.494
- I should go say hello.
- We all should.

08:57.870 --> 08:58.996
Kaldur'ahm.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.414
Lori Lemaris.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.125
Allow me to introduce you
to our friend, Delphis.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.628
Hello, Delphis,
lovely to meet you.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.338
You look well, Lori.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.798
And you look the same, Wyynde.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.217
Like an eel eager to
slither back to Orm

09:11.217 --> 09:13.219
now that he has escaped
from prison.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.346
Lori, please,
that was ten years ago.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.306
Wyynde was young, impressionable.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.184
An idiot. A Purist idiot.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.978
I am ashamed of my actions,

09:21.978 --> 09:24.438
even my thoughts, back then.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.733
And someday I hope to
prove to you that
I have changed.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.152
Well, if Kaldur loves you,

09:30.236 --> 09:31.404
I suppose there's hope.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.865
Well, if it isn't
the little General.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.159
Get drunk
somewhere else, Sha'ark.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.537
Finally, you show some teeth.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.831
If only the rest of Tritonis

09:41.831 --> 09:45.376
had your mettle
when I annexed
its lower territory.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.336
You attacked
without provocation.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.673
Weakness is
its own provocation, chum.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.757
<i>Ah-poh-shohn!</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:58.472
Now, this is
my kind of diplomacy.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.016
Stop this!

10:01.309 --> 10:03.227
We are here to put
old conflicts behind us.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.563
Save your grievances
for the delegates' table.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.939
You must not forget,

10:07.023 --> 10:09.025
we were all friends
and schoolmates once.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.988
Hm. I respect
your strength, schoolmate,

10:13.988 --> 10:17.992
but don't hold out
too much hope
for tomorrow's conference.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.038
Our High King needs
more than a translation spell

10:22.038 --> 10:25.249
to understand our grievances.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.627
For once, I am forced to agree.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.104
Gabrielle?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.231
No, I mean Violet.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.692
I had no wish to
startle you, mo-- Madia...

10:51.776 --> 10:54.362
Mrs. Daou, or Dr. Daou.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.030
Uh, it's fine.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.574
I know it must be strange
to see...

10:58.574 --> 11:00.618
Yes, strange.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.536
But I'm glad you came.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.580
I wanted to thank you.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.249
I believe Samad and I
owe our visas to you.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.920
Oh, it was
Secretary General Troia.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.256
Who only knew about us
because of you, correct?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.716
Please, come in.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.596
- Thanks.
- You just missed Samad.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.847
Did I?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.265
Um, how is he?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.768
He has a new job
on a fishing boat.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.063
This child of the desert
has never fished
a day in his life,

11:29.063 --> 11:31.482
but he seems to love it.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.942
And how are you doing?

11:32.942 --> 11:36.612
Well, I was an eye surgeon
in Qurac before the war.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.698
Now I sell sunglasses
at the Sunglass Igloo.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.910
I'm hoping
my medical credentials
will transfer,

11:42.910 --> 11:44.787
but for now, it's a living.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.793
Is... there a reason
you came by?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.254
The thing is,

11:53.254 --> 11:55.756
I know Gabrielle's faith
was very important to her,

11:55.840 --> 11:59.135
and I wanted to explore

11:59.135 --> 12:04.056
whether Islam
might hold meaning for me.

12:04.140 --> 12:09.186
Uh... Oh?
Well, I'd love to help you.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.230
What would you like to know?

12:13.482 --> 12:16.318
Was he really the best
we could get?

12:16.402 --> 12:19.447
It was all I could do
to get my father to send him.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.869
I hereby call
this conference to order,

12:24.869 --> 12:29.999
and welcome the delegate
from Xebel. Bishop Beluga.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.668
King Nereus continues to
mock us

12:32.668 --> 12:35.671
by sending one
so insignificant.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.174
More experienced leaders
would be here

12:38.174 --> 12:42.094
if Nanauve wasn't killing them
in raids staged across
our borders.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.221
I'll take that as a compliment.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.183
We have lost
some of the old guard
to recent battle.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.977
While others have
voluntarily stepped down

12:49.977 --> 12:53.022
in accordance with
our teachings and prophecies.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.192
We are here to discuss
many issues,

12:56.192 --> 13:00.321
including increased hostility
between our borders,

13:00.321 --> 13:02.698
and inside our algae bars.

13:02.698 --> 13:07.703
But we must remain civil
if we hope to find solutions.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.039
Nanauve's incursions
upon the territories...

13:10.039 --> 13:11.749
Our waters are
warming, thanks to

13:11.749 --> 13:14.126
your surface friends, Orin.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.337
It's killing
my kingdom's krill,

13:16.337 --> 13:18.506
the backbone of our food chain.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.634
Nanauve must take
more territory to survive.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.261
- Keep moving or die.
- Exactly!

13:25.804 --> 13:29.308
No, I can't be dead.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.687
I can feel my heart beat,
so I'm alive,

13:33.771 --> 13:36.815
unless heartbeats are
just a ghostly habit.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.734
But you've got one too.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.444
And you're breathing.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.530
So if we're both alive,

13:42.530 --> 13:44.698
why can't I touch you?

13:44.782 --> 13:47.660
I mean, the ground
feels solid enough

13:47.660 --> 13:50.829
or is that just because
I took it for granted.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.208
Did I take for granted
that you are a ghost
I can't touch?

13:55.334 --> 13:58.003
Maybe if I believe
you're solid.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.799
Okay, then.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.511
Tell you what.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.764
I'll believe you're alive
if you believe I'm alive.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.140
Deal?

14:14.603 --> 14:16.063
Um...

14:21.694 --> 14:25.447
I'm searching for answers
to so many questions,

14:25.531 --> 14:29.451
but maybe we can
start with the hijab.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.954
Gabrielle wore it,
and I've been

14:31.954 --> 14:35.249
reluctant to stop,
but I don't know why.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.835
Why do you wear it?

14:37.835 --> 14:44.049
Like most things of import,
the hijab is many things
to many people.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.344
Different Muslim women wear it
for different reasons,

14:47.428 --> 14:50.306
and some don't wear it at all.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.518
Personally, I choose
to wear the hijab as,

14:54.602 --> 14:59.064
a constant and comforting
reminder of my faith.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.651
A reminder that life
on Earth is temporary.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.820
And I must use
my time wisely

15:04.820 --> 15:07.906
to do good and be
the best person I can be.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.535
I imagine it's not
unlike the reasons

15:11.619 --> 15:15.164
why your super friends
wear such a variety of symbols.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.832
Isn't that true, Halo?

15:16.832 --> 15:18.751
Uh... You know?

15:18.751 --> 15:23.297
Of course, you know.
You saw the footage
from Markovia last year.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.090
It was hard to miss...

15:25.174 --> 15:26.133
Agh!

15:30.763 --> 15:31.639
Ah!

15:32.931 --> 15:35.100
This is your gift. It's...

15:35.184 --> 15:36.602
A work in progress.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.188
Healing other people
is difficult.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.606
But I'm trying.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.776
Trying is all
any of us can do.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.071
With the hijab,
I try to invite others

15:47.071 --> 15:50.449
to focus on more than
my outer appearance,

15:50.449 --> 15:54.078
to look past the unrealistic
standards of society

15:54.078 --> 15:56.580
and see the woman I am inside.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.708
I would like to be judged on
who I am inside,

15:59.792 --> 16:03.420
but would that still work
if I wasn't exactly a woman?

16:03.504 --> 16:04.546
What do you mean?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.216
I just have
so many questions.

16:07.216 --> 16:11.929
Would it be all right to
continue to wear the hijab
while I seek answers?

16:13.472 --> 16:16.600
Many Muslim women,
especially young women
like you,

16:16.684 --> 16:20.729
begin wearing the hijab
inspired by family
or tradition,

16:20.813 --> 16:24.858
before deciding why
or whether it matters to them.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.570
In the end, you must
follow your heart.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.909
Climate change and pollution
from the surface

16:33.909 --> 16:35.911
is devastating our oceans.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.330
Thought your embassy
was supposed to fix that.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.165
It is my highest priority.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.085
But too many surface dwellers
are foolish and stubborn,

16:43.085 --> 16:45.879
obsessed with short-term
economic concerns

16:45.963 --> 16:48.924
that blind them to
the larger issues
facing our planet.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.385
We have larger issues
down here.

16:51.385 --> 16:56.140
I left the surface world
because a lack of opportunity
created an anger

16:56.140 --> 16:58.642
which Black Manta
was eager to exploit.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.437
Yes, yes. We all
know your history.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.398
How you betrayed Manta,
took his woman,

17:04.398 --> 17:06.358
and raised his son
as your own.

17:06.442 --> 17:10.612
Let me be clear,
my biological father
is immaterial.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.198
Calvin Durham is my father
in every way that matters.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.452
Indeed. For how else
does a man of his low status

17:16.452 --> 17:18.912
and dubious history
merit this table

17:18.996 --> 17:21.707
were he not father
to the great Kaldur'ahm.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.001
Ronal, can you please,
for one minute,

17:24.001 --> 17:26.420
stop being
such a pompous codfish.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.423
I... I'm sorry.
I meant no offense.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.133
Everything said of me is true.

17:31.133 --> 17:35.387
My absence of options on land
caused me to make bad choices.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.806
Now I see many of
the same problems

17:37.890 --> 17:40.851
in Shayeris that I saw
in my native San Diego.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.895
The wealth that
begets opportunity,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.689
seen on easy display
in Poseidonis

17:45.773 --> 17:47.983
is largely absent
from the other cities.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.486
Aye, that we can agree on.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.947
I appreciate your
directness, all of you.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.700
I will not pretend
the way forward
will be easy,

17:56.784 --> 18:00.954
but my Cabinet and I believe
we have viable solutions

18:01.038 --> 18:02.247
if we work tog...

18:16.261 --> 18:18.764
Maybe we are dead.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.601
Maybe this is some sort of
Kryptonian afterlife.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.311
You're not Kryptonian, are you?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.773
Hmm. Don't even
know your name.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.026
I gotta call you something,

18:31.026 --> 18:34.029
Maybe... Ghosty?

18:34.029 --> 18:37.282
Yeah, everyone tells me
I suck at naming.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.078
Still it's better than
"Coma Girl," right?

18:41.078 --> 18:43.622
What am I
babbling about?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.208
I need to get you help
and there's none here.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.585
So I guess we keep moving.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.212
But which way?

18:50.212 --> 18:53.131
There's only mist and rocks
for miles in every direction.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
Except...

18:56.385 --> 18:57.719
In infrared.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.555
A heat trail.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.682
That's something anyway.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.975
What do you think, Ghosty?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.520
My sentiments exactly.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.997
Agh!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.124
Brother, you have
made a grave error.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.293
Do not think of me
as your brother, Orin.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.628
I am sure I do not.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.016
Agh!

19:47.019 --> 19:48.103
Rodunn!

19:48.103 --> 19:49.813
Coral, please!
The baby!

19:49.897 --> 19:52.858
Rodunn is hurt.
I must go to my husband.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.536
Move!

20:04.620 --> 20:06.330
My wife and husband are there.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.291
Coral, is he...
Is the baby.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.753
We will all be fine
if Ocean-Master
is stopped.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.338
The trident's too powerful.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.299
- Agh!
- I can't maintain my construct.

20:20.928 --> 20:21.970
Agh!

20:35.275 --> 20:37.152
Kaldur!/ La'gann!

20:39.071 --> 20:41.198
Time to cull...

20:43.659 --> 20:46.036
Who dares?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.862
What is Islam?

21:20.946 --> 21:24.574
Again, like all faiths,
it is many things
to many people.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.578
And the Muslim community
is hardly monolithic.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.748
But the basic tenets
are not complicated.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.834
There is no God but God.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.587
No God but the creator
of the heaven and the earth

21:37.671 --> 21:39.089
and everything.
in between.

21:39.089 --> 21:43.051
I met one who
called herself a god.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.594
<i>She had tremendous power,</i>

21:44.678 --> 21:48.890
<i>but was abusive,
petty, spiteful,</i>

21:48.974 --> 21:51.059
<i>greedy, destructive,</i>

21:52.019 --> 21:53.353
poisonous.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.147
Then she was not a god.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.399
She was not God.

21:57.399 --> 22:03.530
God would never cause
such pain and hardship,
nor condone such abuse.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.365
Then what is God?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.200
In our teachings,

22:07.284 --> 22:12.247
God has 99 names,
including <i>Al-Rahim,</i>
The Most Compassionate.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.750
<i>Al-Ra'uf,</i> The Most Merciful,

22:14.750 --> 22:18.086
and <i>Al-Hafiz,</i>
The Protector.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.922
These are all attributes
you may reflect upon

22:21.006 --> 22:23.925
should you continue
this journey.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.595
I found I was proud of you
for turning down

22:26.595 --> 22:29.723
King Brion's offer
to be his queen.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.851
I believe you are
on a good path,

22:32.851 --> 22:34.603
and I believe
I would like to see

22:34.603 --> 22:36.521
where this path leads you.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.857
Wherever it leads you.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.281
Thank you.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.283
Where's the man who saved us?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.077
Who was he?

22:52.496 --> 22:54.372
He had power.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.375
True power.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.335
Orin, the Prophecy.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.212
We'll discuss it later.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.214
Poseidonis needs us.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.175
Are you all right?

23:05.175 --> 23:06.301
I am fine.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.719
I have to be.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.763
Ocean-Master is out there

23:09.763 --> 23:11.681
and we must find him.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.241
Who was that man?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.159
Who in all the Seven Seas

23:31.243 --> 23:33.912
could command such power
and defeat me?

23:33.912 --> 23:36.498
I do not know,
but please calm yourself.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.958
You are injured.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.168
And in the end,
you will triumph,
my Prince.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.837
Do not call me Prince!

23:41.837 --> 23:43.922
I reject that title.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.551
Now and forever,

23:47.551 --> 23:52.264
I am Orm, the Ocean-Master.

23:58.645 --> 24:02.232
It went well,
but the search for
any answer reminds me

24:02.232 --> 24:05.026
of how many more
questions I have.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.361
Like what?

24:06.361 --> 24:08.238
I have been
considering my gender.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.992
And I believe it's time
I decide upon my
preferred pronouns.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.076
Okay, cool.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.036
Uh, what are you thinking?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.371
I'm not sure.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.249
I am not troubled
by she and her.

24:19.249 --> 24:23.086
Yet, perhaps they and them
are a better fit for me?

24:23.170 --> 24:26.798
The whole point is
for you to decide
what fits you best.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.550
Hmm.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.387
Aside from the fact that
I am the sum of both
Gabrielle and Motherbox,

24:32.471 --> 24:35.891
I feel my true gender
is non-binary

24:35.891 --> 24:38.894
neither just female
nor just male.

24:38.894 --> 24:43.023
So I believe I prefer "they."

24:43.023 --> 24:44.524
That's great!

24:44.608 --> 24:47.903
World, allow me
to introduce you
to Violet Harper.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.031
They are the best person
I know.

24:51.031 --> 24:54.326
Hello, world.
Nice to meet you.
