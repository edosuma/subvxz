WEBVTT

02:56.500 --> 02:58.291
Follow me.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.833
The first Choctaw's name

03:02.833 --> 03:04.583
was Chafa.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.625
She saved her family from their cave.

03:18.958 --> 03:23.000
And that's the story
of the first Choctaw people.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.416
You're

03:29.416 --> 03:31.166
my family.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.583
My sister.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.541
No.

03:33.541 --> 03:35.000
We're cousins.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.916
No. Sisters.

04:58.916 --> 05:02.916
Will they stay outside in the tent?

05:04.166 --> 05:07.875
I give it five minutes or less.

05:11.583 --> 05:14.250
It's raining in the tent!

05:14.250 --> 05:16.625
We need hot chocolate.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.083
Sorry lovebug, we're out.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.125
But, I'll go to the store.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.708
Come with me

05:25.833 --> 05:27.208
and help me choose.

06:06.541 --> 06:07.791
What's wrong Mama?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.416
She will love it.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.875
She misses you.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.791
I miss her.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.958
And Mama.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.666
I know, sweetie.

09:20.541 --> 09:23.458
Will you tell Mama

09:23.458 --> 09:24.875
I'm sorry?

09:25.208 --> 09:26.875
It's my fault

09:26.875 --> 09:28.916
that she's hurt.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.333
I made her

09:33.333 --> 09:35.708
take me to the store.

09:37.708 --> 09:38.500
Maya.

09:39.458 --> 09:40.000
No.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.333
Is she gonna be okay?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.125
Can Bonnie come?

10:29.833 --> 10:30.916
I go too.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.125
Bonnie too.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.250
Bonnie too.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.958
Bonnie.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.333
Are dragons real?

11:25.666 --> 11:26.500
No.

11:26.708 --> 11:28.458
Or maybe they are

11:28.875 --> 11:30.083
but dragons

11:30.458 --> 11:32.250
live in a different world.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.791
What if

11:34.791 --> 11:37.041
they learned

11:37.041 --> 11:38.458
to come

11:38.458 --> 11:40.333
into our world?

11:41.291 --> 11:43.208
That would

11:43.208 --> 11:44.833
make them

11:44.833 --> 11:45.916
stronger.

11:46.416 --> 11:48.666
You have to learn

11:48.666 --> 11:49.541
to jump

11:49.541 --> 11:52.041
between two worlds.

11:54.125 --> 11:54.958
How?

11:56.333 --> 11:58.500
By watching.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.208
I want to be like you.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.125
I know, but

12:08.458 --> 12:09.708
remember

12:10.416 --> 12:12.000
school is your focus.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.291
You're going to grow up

12:15.291 --> 12:17.791
and have a different life

12:18.083 --> 12:19.000
than me.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.291
I want yours to be better.

14:36.125 --> 14:36.958
Please, just go.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.500
I won't leave you.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.041
I'm already gone.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.708
Do you?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.333
How?

19:07.500 --> 19:08.083
Ready?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.666
You again?

25:14.083 --> 25:15.375
Immensely.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.041
Thank you, Uncle.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.583
When you find him, he's mine.

26:44.583 --> 26:45.791
You

26:46.416 --> 26:47.833
and I, we're the same.

26:49.666 --> 26:51.000
When you're filled with rage,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.083
it makes you blind.

26:54.791 --> 26:55.583
You can be used.

26:57.625 --> 26:58.541
You can be manipulated.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.083
Your boss

27:00.083 --> 27:01.833
wanted your father dead.

27:03.833 --> 27:04.500
Yes.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.583
Your...

27:06.250 --> 27:07.375
boss.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.000
You're lying.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.000
Maya?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.583
You look the same...

33:35.250 --> 33:38.333
after 20 years.

33:39.791 --> 33:40.583
How long...

33:41.583 --> 33:43.541
...are you in town?

33:44.041 --> 33:45.166
Not long.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.166
That's...

33:48.916 --> 33:51.791
Billy Jack.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.375
This is Maya...

33:55.791 --> 33:56.833
She's our cousin.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.416
She's good people.

33:59.666 --> 34:00.875
Yes, I know.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.083
She was busy...

34:04.041 --> 34:04.750
New York.

34:05.875 --> 34:06.791
Huge.

34:10.041 --> 34:11.791
Is this yours?

34:13.041 --> 34:13.958
Oh the truck?

34:14.291 --> 34:15.958
No no no, that's Grandma's.

34:16.791 --> 34:17.291
Come here.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.250
I wish I knew you were coming.

34:26.541 --> 34:28.208
I'm here for a business thing.

34:28.416 --> 34:29.333
In and out.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.791
I want you to keep quiet about this.

34:34.250 --> 34:34.916
No one

34:35.166 --> 34:36.333
needs to know I'm here.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.041
If Grandma asks me...

34:38.250 --> 34:39.500
Whatever.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.833
Just do what you can
to keep it between us.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.416
Understood.

34:47.416 --> 34:48.791
Good to see you.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.125
Cousin.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.375
We've been playing this since the 90s.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.916
You should switch it up.

37:56.125 --> 37:57.208
Are you nuts?

37:57.833 --> 38:00.583
Look at those glowing faces.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.083
What's going on?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.250
Let's talk somewhere private.

38:58.416 --> 39:01.291
That guy you have working for you sucks.

39:02.625 --> 39:03.458
Vickie?

39:05.416 --> 39:06.125
He's alright.

39:07.750 --> 39:08.916
Pain in my ass

39:09.708 --> 39:11.708
but he's worked for me

39:12.041 --> 39:13.166
many years.

39:13.708 --> 39:15.125
Not only at the rink.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.291
You know?

39:17.541 --> 39:18.958
So they finally caught up to you.

39:22.250 --> 39:23.833
Bullet or blade?

39:24.583 --> 39:25.333
Bullet.

39:29.208 --> 39:31.000
What are we working with here?

39:31.541 --> 39:33.250
Hopefully, not that thing.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.625
She's not embalming you today.

39:44.166 --> 39:45.000
Gretchen's

39:45.000 --> 39:47.250
our resident mortician.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.583
You're an undertaker?

39:49.583 --> 39:52.416
If you want a body fixed...

39:52.875 --> 39:55.250
If you want a body gone...

39:55.708 --> 39:57.291
She's the person you call.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.125
You want me fixed...

40:01.500 --> 40:02.625
or gone?

40:04.125 --> 40:05.541
Let's start

40:05.541 --> 40:07.083
with fixed.

41:13.041 --> 41:14.208
If she

41:14.583 --> 41:16.500
finds out you were here

41:18.041 --> 41:18.958
and you

41:19.291 --> 41:20.750
didn't see her

41:22.333 --> 41:24.708
you will break

41:24.708 --> 41:25.750
her heart.

41:26.166 --> 41:28.875
Her feelings aren't my business.

41:30.750 --> 41:31.708
I disagree.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.000
Also not my business.

41:46.083 --> 41:47.208
Your turn.

42:06.875 --> 42:08.500
I figured you needed more from me

42:08.500 --> 42:09.958
than stitches.

42:13.041 --> 42:15.750
I need just one train car.

42:16.041 --> 42:19.416
To send Fisk's men a message.

42:19.416 --> 42:21.833
With your shipping route.

42:22.666 --> 42:25.208
I won't bring a war here.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.250
To the people I love

42:27.958 --> 42:29.125
and who

42:29.875 --> 42:30.916
love you.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.083
Why are you doing this?

42:33.583 --> 42:35.541
Kingpin had his run.

42:36.541 --> 42:38.416
It's time for a queen.

42:49.291 --> 42:50.833
I never saw you.

42:50.833 --> 42:52.750
We didn't have

42:52.750 --> 42:54.208
this conversation.
