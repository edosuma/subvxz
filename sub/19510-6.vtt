THAT IS MY COT!

19:25.895 --> 19:28.798

THAT IS NOT MY COT!

19:28.798 --> 19:29.939
SOCK, WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:29.939 --> 19:31.271
HE VANDALIZED
POLICE PROPERTY.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.872
OH, IS THIS
REALLY NECESSARY?

19:32.872 --> 19:33.603
DEGENERATE! LAST NIGHT,

19:33.603 --> 19:36.206
HE SHARED A BED
WITH HIS OWN SISTER.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.347
NO, NO. STEPSISTER.

19:37.347 --> 19:38.348
IT'S THE SAME THING.

19:38.348 --> 19:39.749
NO! REALLY, IT'S NOT.

19:39.749 --> 19:41.751
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

19:41.751 --> 19:42.712
NO, NO, NOT SICK.
HEALTHY.

19:42.712 --> 19:45.685
YOU'RE A VERY

I'M STILL GONNA RELEASE
YOUR CAR TO YOU

20:48.448 --> 20:51.551

21:50.710 --> 21:51.741
NO, I'LL TAKE HER, SAM.

21:51.741 --> 21:54.584
I GOT A COUPLE THINGS

I'M REALLY SORRY

22:19.609 --> 22:21.811
DIDN'T TURN OUT THE WAY
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

22:21.811 --> 22:23.743
IT WAS NEVER GONNA BE
A VACATION, SAM.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.646
THE SOUL WAS ALWAYS
YOUR FIRST PRIORITY.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.749
WHY DON'T WE JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS WHEN I GET BACK?

22:29.749 --> 22:33.423
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'LL BE FINE.

22:33.423 --> 22:35.725

22:57.146 --> 22:59.048

CAN I HELP YOU?

22:59.048 --> 23:01.511
I AM LOOKING
FOR MY FRIENDS.

23:01.511 --> 23:02.812
THEY ENJOY
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES,

23:02.812 --> 23:04.113
SO I THOUGHT
THEY MIGHT BE HERE.

23:04.113 --> 23:06.055
OH. UH, 3 GUYS,
2 GIRLS,

23:06.055 --> 23:07.787
KIND OF

SO NOBODY KNOWS
YOU'RE HERE, THEN.

23:36.986 --> 23:39.449

24:13.983 --> 24:14.824
SHE BOOGIED OUT OF HERE?

24:14.824 --> 24:17.757
DID SHE ASK ABOUT ME?
DID SHE SEND ME A MESSAGE?

24:17.757 --> 24:19.629
IN A BOTTLE OR PIGEON
OR SOMETHING?
NO!

24:19.629 --> 24:22.191
WE GOTTA FOCUS, GET YOU
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

24:22.191 --> 24:23.663
WE COULD
GO SHAWSHANK.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.534
SHAWSHANK?

24:24.534 --> 24:25.464
WE SMUGGLE IN
A ROCK PICK,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.536
AND SOCK COULD DIG
HIS WAY OUT.

24:26.536 --> 24:27.667
THAT WAS A MOVIE, BEN.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.167
IT WAS BASED
ON A BOOK.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.468
YEAH. DIDN'T IT TAKE HIM,
LIKE, 20 YEARS?

24:29.468 --> 24:30.840
YOU GUYS, WE DON'T
HAVE 20 MINUTES.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.642
THE SHERIFF COULD
BE HERE ANY SECOND.

24:32.642 --> 24:33.603
ALL RIGHT. OK.

24:33.603 --> 24:35.505
THEN WE BREAK
THE LOCK.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.678

I COULD BORROW SOMETHING--

24:53.863 --> 24:55.494

24:56.526 --> 24:58.127
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT OLD THING FOR?

24:58.127 --> 25:03.232
UH, J--I JUST NEED
TO AX SOMETHING.

25:03.703 --> 25:04.734

25:04.734 --> 25:07.607
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.639

SORT OF AN ANTIQUE.

NINA'S PURSE.

25:24.854 --> 25:27.196
YOU CAN BORROW MY AX.

COME BACK HERE
AND TAKE IT DOWN.

HE JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.

26:10.740 --> 26:12.201
I'VE BEEN ALL ALONE
WITH THIS THING

26:12.201 --> 26:12.942
GOIN' ON 10 YEARS NOW.

26:12.942 --> 26:14.343
THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE
STARTED DISAPPEARIN'.

26:14.343 --> 26:16.005
THEY DIDN'T
JUST DISAPPEAR.

26:16.005 --> 26:17.046
THAT THING ATE THEM,

26:17.046 --> 26:18.908
AND YOU
FED THEM TO IT.

26:18.908 --> 26:20.179
WELL, I HAD NO CHOICE.

26:20.179 --> 26:24.313
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO STOP PEOPLE FROM COMIN' HERE.

26:24.313 --> 26:25.785
I DROVE THE LOCALS OUT.

26:25.785 --> 26:30.189
I--I TURNED AWAY
WHOLE BUSLOADS OF TOURISTS.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.061
NOW LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

26:32.061 --> 26:33.292
IT'S A GHOST TOWN.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.694
I'VE NOTICED.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.165
IF I'M NOT HERE
TO STOP IT,

26:36.165 --> 26:39.368
THEN IT MIGHT GO ON
TO THE NEXT TOWN,
THE NEXT STATE.

26:39.368 --> 26:43.332
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE

26:43.332 --> 26:44.373
TO BE STUCK IN A SITUATION

26:44.373 --> 26:47.807
WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANNA DO
AND THERE'S NO WAY OUT?

26:47.807 --> 26:51.811
YEAH. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

26:51.811 --> 26:55.715
UM, IS EVERYBODY
IN THE TOWN THAT THING?

26:55.715 --> 26:58.387
I MEAN, ARE THEY
ALL TENTACLES?

26:58.387 --> 26:59.118
YEAH.

26:59.118 --> 26:59.819
IT--IT MIMICS PEOPLE,

26:59.819 --> 27:01.290
AND IT USES THEM
LIKE FISHING LURES,

27:01.290 --> 27:04.994
AND THEN IT TAKES
EVERYBODY UP IN THE MINE
WHERE IT FEEDS.

27:04.994 --> 27:06.996
SO WHY'D YOU DECIDE
TO HELP US NOW?

27:06.996 --> 27:09.328
WHEN I READ
YOUR DEVIL FOLDER,

27:09.328 --> 27:13.132
I FIGURED MAYBE YOU
WERE SENT TO HELP.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.234
I TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.037
NOW YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU ARE.

27:23.072 --> 27:26.015
I SAVED YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.248
EVERYTHING YOU SAW
IN THAT FOLDER,

27:29.248 --> 27:31.320
IT'S FOR REAL.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.922
I CATCH SOULS
FOR THE DEVIL,

27:32.922 --> 27:34.323
SOULS THAT HAVE
ESCAPED FROM HELL,

27:34.323 --> 27:37.356
LIKE THE ONE
IN YOUR MINE HERE.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.759
HAS ANYONE
ESCAPED FROM IT?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.330
I MEAN, MAYBE IT--
THAT THING

27:41.330 --> 27:43.232
DIDN'T EAT NINA RIGHT AWAY.

27:43.232 --> 27:44.994
OH, NO. SORRY, SON.

27:44.994 --> 27:48.868
TAKES EVERYTHING
IN ONE BIG GULP.

27:49.338 --> 27:51.701
THINK SHE WENT DOWN
SWIFTLY, RIGHT?

27:51.701 --> 27:54.273
TILL DIGESTION STARTS.

27:55.204 --> 27:57.376
IF YOU'RE WORKIN'
FOR THE DEVIL,
HOPE YOU GOT A PLAN.

27:57.376 --> 28:02.151
YEAH. I'M GONNA
SEND IT BACK TO HELL...

28:02.151 --> 28:02.952
WITH THIS.

28:02.952 --> 28:04.914
WELL, THAT--THAT'S JUST
GONNA MAKE IT ANGRY.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.685
IT'S NOT
A NORMAL GRENADE.
IT'S A VESSEL.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.689
I JUST NEED TO GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE
SOUL TO CATCH IT.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.292
OK.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.323
NICE.

28:14.323 --> 28:19.999
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I KNOW HOW I CAN HELP.

28:24.273 --> 28:24.403
GAS?

28:24.403 --> 28:27.206
WELL, THE TRICKY THING ABOUT
THIS CREATURE IS FINDIN' IT,

28:27.206 --> 28:29.108
SO I'M GONNA
SMOKE IT OUT.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.410
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AT THE MINE ENTRANCE.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.783
I'M GONNA DRIVE IT TO YOU.

28:33.783 --> 28:35.484
GOOD IDEA.

28:40.950 --> 28:42.752
DO YOU SMELL SMOKE YET?

28:42.752 --> 28:44.854
ALL I CAN SMELL
IS KRISTEN.

28:44.854 --> 28:48.157
SHE WAS LIKE
VANILLA, BOYS.

28:48.157 --> 28:49.158
VANILLA.

28:49.158 --> 28:51.260
THIS IS TAKIN'
TOO LONG.
YEAH.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.762
SCREW IT.
WAIT! NO, BEN!

28:52.762 --> 28:54.303
Sam: WHAT THE HELL
YOU DOIN', MAN?

28:54.303 --> 28:56.806
SHE'S DEAD.
NINA'S DEAD.

28:56.806 --> 28:57.506
I HAVE NOTHING
TO LIVE FOR.

28:57.506 --> 29:00.009
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THIS THING MYSELF.

29:00.009 --> 29:01.270
NO! BEN, YOU'RE
BEING CRAZY. COME ON.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.913
YOU'RE GONNA
GET EATEN IN THERE.
LISTEN! HEY, LISTEN!

29:03.913 --> 29:05.875
YOU WERE DATING NINA
FOR, WHAT, LIKE 3 WEEKS?

29:05.875 --> 29:08.978
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
JUST LOST A SISTER
AND A LOVER.

29:08.978 --> 29:10.850
I THINK IF WE STICK
TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE IT

29:10.850 --> 29:12.852
THROUGH THIS AS A TEAM,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:12.852 --> 29:15.284
NO. I'M NOT GONNA
FIND ANYONE ELSE.

29:15.284 --> 29:17.987
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF FISH IN THE SEA.

29:17.987 --> 29:19.088
DOESN'T MATTER.

29:19.088 --> 29:21.090
I MEAN,
WHO'S GONNA WANT ME?

29:21.090 --> 29:22.231
YOU BITE YOUR
TONGUE, BENJAMIN.

29:22.231 --> 29:25.795
YOU BITE YOUR TONGUE
TILL IT BLEEDS
IN YOUR MOUTH.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.166
YOU ARE
A BEAUTIFUL MAN,

29:27.166 --> 29:28.898
ON THE OUTSIDE
AND THE INSIDE.

29:28.898 --> 29:31.140
YOU GOT THAT--
YOU GOT THAT SMILE

29:31.140 --> 29:32.241
THAT LIGHTS UP
A ROOM,

29:32.241 --> 29:34.243
THAT LAUGH, THAT

KRISTEN.

40:08.076 --> 40:08.877
HI.

40:08.877 --> 40:12.581
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE BECOME FRIENDS.

40:12.581 --> 40:14.082
WE...

40:14.082 --> 40:15.614
CERTAINLY HAVE.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.585
WE WERE, UH...

40:16.585 --> 40:19.117
JUST ON OUR WAY
OUTSIDE TO PLAY HORSIE,

40:19.117 --> 40:20.889
DO A LITTLE ROUGHHOUSING,
MAYBE.

40:20.889 --> 40:22.551
I DON'T KNOW. LAWN DARTS.

40:22.551 --> 40:24.523
HEH. COME ON, SIS.
LET'S GO.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.954
OK!

40:30.959 --> 40:34.002
HEY, BUDDY.

40:34.463 --> 40:36.434
OH. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.906
OH, JUST TO TELL YOU
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

40:37.906 --> 40:40.509
IT WAS A TOUGH ONE,
BUT YOU CAME THROUGH
WITH FLYING COLORS.

40:40.509 --> 40:42.741
I'M SO PLEASED TO SEE YOU
COMING INTO YOUR OWN.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.573
YEAH, WELL, THANKS FOR
SETTING ME UP

40:44.573 --> 40:45.914
FOR A TRAIN WRECK
OF A WEEKEND GETAWAY.

40:45.914 --> 40:49.548
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW IMPOSSIBLE YOU'VE
MADE MY LIFE?

40:49.548 --> 40:50.018
ANDI IS FURIOUS WITH ME,

40:50.018 --> 40:52.551
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT UP TO HER.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.452
SAM, I WANNA TELL YOU
THAT I DON'T PUT YOU

40:54.452 --> 40:55.684
IN HARM'S WAY
JUST TO GET MY JOLLIES.

40:55.684 --> 41:00.629
I PUT YOU
IN THESE SITUATIONS BECAUSE
I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU.

41:00.629 --> 41:03.231
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.

41:03.231 --> 41:04.162
OH. THAT'S GREAT.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.463
AND I ALSO WANNA TELL YOU

41:05.463 --> 41:09.498
YOU CAN HANDLE MUCH MORE
THAN YOU REALIZE.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.471
YOU CAN WITHSTAND ANY BLOW,

41:13.471 --> 41:14.042
ANY BLOW.

41:14.042 --> 41:16.605
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

41:23.652 --> 41:24.953
DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE BACK.

41:24.953 --> 41:29.217
UH, YEAH. I--I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO COME AND FIND YOU.

41:29.217 --> 41:29.958
MMM.

41:29.958 --> 41:31.259
I WANNA APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS WEEKEND.

41:31.259 --> 41:34.793
IT GOT MESSED UP
IN A LOT OF WAYS,
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.666
BUT I--I THINK
WE SHOULD TRY IT AGAIN.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.067
YOU KNOW,
JUST YOU AND ME,

41:39.067 --> 41:43.201
WE TAKE ANOTHER LONG WEEKEND.
H-HOW ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK?

41:43.201 --> 41:44.102
I CAN'T.

41:44.102 --> 41:47.275
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE THE MANAGER NOW.

41:47.275 --> 41:49.007
JUST REWORK THE SCHEDULE
A LITTLE.

41:49.007 --> 41:54.042
SAM, I CAN'T MAKE PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE,

41:54.042 --> 41:55.584
NOT WITH YOU.

41:55.584 --> 41:56.014
WHAT?

41:56.014 --> 41:58.086
YOU KNOW, EVIL HAS
WORKED ITS WAY

41:58.086 --> 41:59.688
INTO EVERY PART
OF YOUR LIFE.

41:59.688 --> 42:03.992
I MEAN, EVERY DAY,
IT SURROUNDS YOU--

42:03.992 --> 42:06.955
DEMONS, HELL.

42:06.955 --> 42:11.199
I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK THAT YOU'RE
STARTING TO LIKE IT...

42:12.631 --> 42:14.532
THAT IT'S CHANGING YOU.

42:14.532 --> 42:18.206
M-MAYBE IT'S
ALWAYS BEEN IN YOU.

42:18.206 --> 42:21.309
I JUST NEVER SAW IT.

42:22.671 --> 42:25.013
I'M SORRY, SAM.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.649
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

42:31.219 --> 42:33.051
ANDI, WAIT.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.954
ARE YOU
BREAKING UP WITH ME?
