WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:10.885
[Clint] Maggie?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.016
It's like three o'clock in the morning.
You okay?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.268
Yeah. Little hungover.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.772
Trying to figure out the rest of my life.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.609
[sighs] You wanna talk about anything?

00:28.820 --> 00:32.532
I got up, I got dressed, I was gonna
steal your wallet and sneak out.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.991
There's no money in my wallet.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.785
Trust me, I know.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.206
I was about to leave...

00:40.790 --> 00:42.750
but that would mean heading back

00:42.834 --> 00:46.129
to the same old thing
I've been doing for the last 40 years.

00:47.004 --> 00:48.005
Same people.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.508
Same conversations.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.177
Same ol' Maggie.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.058
Do you have any idea
how much fun I had last night?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.892
Well, I have a pretty good idea.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.105
Yeah, yeah, the sex was fine.

01:03.771 --> 01:05.773
Okay. [chuckles softly]

01:05.857 --> 01:08.025
I'm sorry, it was great.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.902
But it was more than that.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.654
It was the whole night.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.656
You know, I... I was free.

01:14.907 --> 01:15.950
I don't know...

01:16.534 --> 01:20.080
it's like the feeling you get
when you're 17 years old,

01:20.163 --> 01:22.082
and it's the first day of summer vacation,

01:22.165 --> 01:25.585
and you just discovered
where your sister hides her weed.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.044
I don't wanna lose that feeling.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.130
[grunts]

01:29.714 --> 01:31.007
I get it.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.552
Freedom like that's
the best thing in the world.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.179
[sighs]

01:36.846 --> 01:37.847
Except for cocaine.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.643
Fuck, I miss getting high.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.230
Where are you headed next?

01:45.855 --> 01:46.981
Well, after what I just said,

01:47.064 --> 01:49.359
I should probably hit a meeting up
somewhere around here.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.155
Then I got a gig in Albuquerque
in a few days.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.698
I'm playing the Bernalillo Winter Harvest.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.119
I go on right after they crown
the Bernalillo Armadillo Princess.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.455
You want a ride?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.166
You wanna go on the road with me?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.627
Well, I wanna go to Albuquerque with you.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.003
After that, who knows?

02:09.086 --> 02:10.838
Maybe I'll go to the next town,

02:10.922 --> 02:14.426
or maybe I'll just settle down
in Albuquerque and open a candle shop.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.720
Well, probably not that
'cause it sounds fucking awful.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.350
Either way, I'm not going back.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.519
Great. So what's the next step?

02:24.602 --> 02:25.770
I gotta go back.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.232
I have a few things
I have to take care of.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.776
And I can't leave without saying
goodbye to my family.

02:31.859 --> 02:34.946
'Cause last time I did that,
they just got all pissy.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.739
They're real drama queens. [chuckles]

02:37.949 --> 02:40.202
Yeah. Family comes first.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.288
Unless, of course,
you have a chance to buy a really pure,

02:43.371 --> 02:44.997
uncut eight-ball of cocaine.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.503
[theme song playing]

03:53.233 --> 03:54.317
Hey!

03:54.984 --> 03:56.236
Mornin'.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.195
Did you get any sleep last night?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.157
[groans] I got about three hours.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.662
Had a 20-minute break at the Safeway,
slept for half of that.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.165
I fell asleep at that stoplight on Mesa.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.043
Cop woke me up.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.963
Uh, neither one of us could believe
I wasn't drunk.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.299
[both chuckle]

04:19.342 --> 04:21.052
Shit. You wanna get breakfast together?

04:21.135 --> 04:24.472
Oh, I can't. I promised my friend, Linda,
I'd meet her at the gym before school.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.559
We like to go on the elliptical
and watch  The Today Show.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.062
I love when Al Roker
wishes old people a happy birthday.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.064
-I don't know why.
-[chuckles]

04:34.440 --> 04:35.858
How 'bout dinner tonight?

04:35.942 --> 04:39.236
Uh, it'd have to be early.
I picked up another shift at Safeway.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.407
Oh, and I got an open house
at school till 7:30.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.826
Longer if I get cornered by Mrs. Bayles.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.619
"Katie isn't being challenged enough."

04:46.703 --> 04:48.455
Having you as a mom, I bet she is.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.001
This sucks.
When the hell we gonna hang out?

04:54.752 --> 04:57.297
I get off early on Friday.
I could be here by 4:00.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.174
Perfect. I don't have to be
at the Safeway till 6:00,

05:00.258 --> 05:01.968
so, Friday at 4:00.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.388
Ooh. Well, maybe you can put on the apron,

05:05.471 --> 05:07.724
and we can play
the stock boy and the...

05:08.558 --> 05:10.977
I don't know, customer who wants
to hook up with the stock boy?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.062
[both chuckle]

05:13.145 --> 05:14.814
[grunts] Yeah!

05:14.897 --> 05:16.190
[gasps]

05:16.273 --> 05:18.318
-And you'd make a cute stock boy.
-[chuckles]

05:19.276 --> 05:20.862
[giggling]

05:22.780 --> 05:24.866
All right, you guys about to do it?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.161
And I'm gonna go to the gym.

05:29.912 --> 05:30.913
Bye, guys.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.206
[Beau] Take care, Abby.

05:32.289 --> 05:36.252
Hey, Ab, uh, if that hot redhead
from the DQ is there,

05:36.335 --> 05:38.087
would you get behind her
and sneak some video?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.467
You know, like, of her butt?

05:44.135 --> 05:46.137
How do you not have to register
where you live?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.976
I'm always impressed at your ability

05:52.059 --> 05:54.061
to make women run out of the room.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.274
[chuckles] Thank you very much, Daddy.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.151
Glad to see you're finally awake.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.487
What are you talking about? It's 5:30.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.113
We start at 5:30. I'm on time.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.032
Early is on time.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.450
On time is late.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.869
Yeah, you didn't know that?
How long you been working here for?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.289
Every day feels like his first day.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.920
You know, at Safeway,
every team member is valued and respected.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.674
Hey, respect this.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.384
[vehicle approaching]

06:28.888 --> 06:30.139
-[Beau] Maggie?
-[Rooster] Hey, Mom.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.226
-[Colt] What you doing here so early?
-It's not early for some people.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.062
On time is on time!

06:37.980 --> 06:39.524
I wanted to talk to you guys
about something.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.025
I figured you'd be up.

06:41.108 --> 06:42.485
I didn't figure you'd be here.

06:42.569 --> 06:46.781
Yeah, well, Dad came a-knocking,
told me Colt was fucking everything up.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.577
Needed to come on back
and clean up his mess, so...

06:50.660 --> 06:53.079
Ha. Ha. That's not what Dad said.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.915
That's not what you said, is it?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.042
What's going on?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.127
You know, you smell like a bar.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.339
But not... not your bar.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.759
Like a... like a bar far away.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.722
You know that lowball offer
I got on the bar?

07:10.805 --> 07:11.806
I'm gonna take it.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.683
You're actually selling the bar?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.518
Yep. I'm leaving.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.856
Oh, shit, I kinda thought that was one of
those crazy things you say you're gonna do

07:19.939 --> 07:22.817
but you're never actually gonna do it.
You know, like reading a book.

07:25.277 --> 07:26.738
Hold on. Wait, no, no, no.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.781
You can't leave.
You got a grandkid on the way.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.326
Colt, I know that,
but that's like six, seven months away.

07:32.409 --> 07:33.786
Okay, what... what if it comes early?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.079
You mean on time?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.209
Where you going?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.170
I have a friend who's playing
a show in Albuquerque.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.464
Who's your friend?

07:45.131 --> 07:47.174
His name is Clint. He's a musician.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.051
I'm driving him to his next gig.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.136
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.679
This that dude
from the bar the other night?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.055
That guy?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.309
No, no, hold on. You can't trust that guy.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.020
That guy don't even drink.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.939
Are you fucking kidding?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.441
You're going down the road
with some guy you met in the bar?

08:04.526 --> 08:06.110
It's not about the guy.

08:06.193 --> 08:07.319
Yeah, right.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.489
You could've sold that place
three weeks ago.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.700
I don't have to explain myself to you.
I'm doing it. That's it.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.161
Great. Good for you.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.416
Gee, I just don't think he meant that.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.586
I don't like it either.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.672
You're just walking out on us.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.258
Well, go on, you going, too?

08:29.341 --> 08:31.343
[chuckles] No, I'm happy for you.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.596
You know, get the fuck outta this town,
follow your dreams.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.931
Thank you, Rooster.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.892
And if you gotta come
crawling back a complete failure,

08:37.975 --> 08:40.687
don't you worry,
I'll accept you just like I did Colt.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.402
Hey, Heather!
Your baby daddy's here!

08:50.196 --> 08:53.199
Well, I was just getting used to
you calling me shithead.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.491
[both chuckle softly]

08:54.576 --> 08:56.035
Give it time, it'll come back.

08:57.369 --> 08:58.996
Hey, Colt. [chuckles]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.957
Wow, you look great.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.292
You got that pregnancy glow.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.379
All that weight you're gaining
is going to all the right places.

09:08.798 --> 09:09.841
Thanks.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.759
Real smooth, shithead.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.930
No, it's... it's not what I meant.
I mean, you look great.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.056
It's okay.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.603
Hey, uh, I got a doctor's appointment
on Friday at 4:00.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.062
You wanna come?

09:23.145 --> 09:24.856
[whispering] Friday at 4:00?

09:24.939 --> 09:28.568
I, um, is... is there any way
we could do it, like, right now?

09:29.902 --> 09:32.529
Yeah, I'm sure there's, like,
a drive-through or somethin'.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.117
Look, Colt, it's not that big of a deal,

09:36.200 --> 09:39.954
it's just they said I might be able
to find out the sex of the baby this time.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.873
[stammers] Yeah, no, I'll be there.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.083
I'm gonna be there
every step of the way with this kid.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.961
And... and, uh, not only will I come,

09:47.044 --> 09:49.213
I'll, uh, pay for it too.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.509
Whoa. Did a baby daddy just hand us money
without a court order?

09:55.469 --> 09:58.014
Should cover all the doctor's bills.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.224
And... and I'll have more
once I get paid from Safeway.

10:00.307 --> 10:01.308
Safeway?

10:01.392 --> 10:04.020
What happened? One of their trucks
hit you in the parking lot?

10:05.562 --> 10:08.775
I, uh, I got a second job
stocking shelves.

10:09.651 --> 10:13.320
So I... I also, uh, opened up
a savings account for the baby.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.864
You opened up a savings account?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.574
That is really sweet, Colt.

10:17.659 --> 10:21.120
Somethin' I wanna do for the little guy,
or girl. Hopefully it's a boy. [chuckles]

10:22.496 --> 10:24.081
Either way,
as long as it's healthy, right?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.333
Ten fingers, ten toes, and a penis.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.884
All right, here you go.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.387
I suppose you heard what happened
last night when you was gone.

10:38.470 --> 10:41.598
-No, what?
-Maria told me I was cut off.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.561
Don't worry. I fired her.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
Hank, you can't fire people here.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.858
Agree to disagree.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.321
-Hey, Maggie.
-Oh, hey, Jerry.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.532
Wait. Jerry's the guy
trying to sell your bar, right?

10:58.615 --> 11:00.409
-Yes.
-You're fired.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.372
Well, it's not the first time
I've heard that today. [chuckles]

11:05.456 --> 11:07.541
-What?
-Oh, it's not important.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.086
We should talk.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.673
Wow. Okay.
I had no idea you were color-blind.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.800
[chuckles]

11:15.883 --> 11:17.593
Well, point of fact, I am.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.387
But that's not why
I'm wearing my green shirt.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.812
I am actually en route
to a Jimmy Buffett concert in Denver.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.607
I've been a Parrot Head
since before it was cool. [chuckles]

11:33.317 --> 11:35.945
Okay, I'm just gonna
let that one slide right by.

11:36.653 --> 11:39.991
And if you'd like to join me,
I have an extra ticket.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.871
And an extra passport
to the fifth dimension.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.457
Acid.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.542
Okay, what's up?

11:50.626 --> 11:53.670
Well, um, two bits of bad news.

11:54.546 --> 11:56.340
First, the offer's gone.

11:56.423 --> 11:57.674
You're fired.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.219
I'm sorry.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.972
After you passed, the buyers moved on

12:03.055 --> 12:05.724
and decided to purchase
the Yarn Barn instead.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.560
And that's the second piece of bad news.

12:09.436 --> 12:12.189
The Yarn Barn is closing.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.444
Fuck the Yarn Barn.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.739
Oh, look who's here.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.449
Hey, Mom. Hey, Jerry.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.077
Hey, did you guys see
they closed the Yarn Barn?

12:25.161 --> 12:27.746
[in sad voice] Oh. I know.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.458
Can I talk to my mom for a sec?

12:31.542 --> 12:34.586
Oh, yeah, of course.
I was just on my way out.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.754
But check this out.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.300
[chuckles] I got this
at last year's concert.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.805
Oh, shit! The Froot Loops bird!

12:45.681 --> 12:47.433
[stutters] Yeah, it's a parrot.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.768
Uh-uh-uh-uh. It's a toucan.
[chuckles softly]

12:51.770 --> 12:53.064
Smarter than a lawyer. [chuckles]

12:54.648 --> 12:56.608
Yeah, well, have a good night.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.903
-Goodbye, Jerry.
-Bye.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.822
What's up with you?

13:01.989 --> 13:03.282
[sighs]

13:05.409 --> 13:08.913
I'm sorry...
for walking away this morning.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.458
You can't leave.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.253
You're my mom.
I'm about to have a kid.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.257
[stammers] And Dad can't be
the only grandparent around.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.800
[stammers] I mean, readin'  Goodnight Moon?

13:21.884 --> 13:25.262
More like readin'  Government Conspiracy
Theory Shot on a Soundstage.

13:28.265 --> 13:32.019
Well, looks like I'm gonna be around,
for a while anyway.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.729
The offer for the bar fell through.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.522
Shit.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.441
You want me to kick his ass?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.277
Whose?

13:40.361 --> 13:43.030
Yeah, I don't know. That's just my
go-to move when something goes wrong.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
[sighs]

13:45.407 --> 13:46.575
Guess, uh...

13:47.869 --> 13:49.578
Guess, in the end,
it's probably a good thing, huh?

13:50.329 --> 13:51.372
Good thing?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.374
Yeah. Like you said,
now you're gonna be around.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.126
Seriously?

13:55.877 --> 14:00.589
So, I just tell you that all my plans
for the future fell apart,

14:00.672 --> 14:03.467
and all you have to say is,
"It's a good thing"?

14:03.550 --> 14:05.719
[scoffs] Are you really that selfish?

14:06.470 --> 14:07.889
I'm selfish?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.642
[stammers] You're the one that's leaving
the family for some guy named Clint.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.185
Ain't even Eastwood.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.648
You know what, Colt? I'm done.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.442
Oh, oh, that's...
[stutters] You're just gonna walk away?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.944
[sighs]

14:22.028 --> 14:23.112
Fine.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.656
Do you wanna have this conversation?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.617
I've devoted my entire life
to this family.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.829
And somewhere along the line,
I just became invisible.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.375
I'm Beau's wife, or your mother,
or Hank's bartender.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.964
[sighs] I just stopped being Maggie.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.467
And I got a whole list of things
that Maggie never got to do.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.137
You know, go to Paris, learn to paint,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.431
go on  The Price Is Right
and kiss Bob Barker.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.725
And that's already gone!

14:55.937 --> 14:59.773
So if it makes me selfish
to wanna go to New Mexico,

14:59.856 --> 15:04.861
not even Mexico, Colt, New Mexico,
then I'm fucking selfish.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.166
[Beau] Hey, Colt.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.461
Oh. Hey, guys.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.755
Hey, man. I just saw that sweet display
where they put the, uh,

15:23.839 --> 15:26.175
Bud and the Bud Light cans
and made it into the American flag.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.593
Did you make that?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.887
I wish. I had a little problem
with the Charmin pyramid.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.182
Now they won't let me stack anything
higher than my waist.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.935
[chuckles] That's cool.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.145
Hey, uh, remember when you used
to be a pro football player?

15:40.064 --> 15:42.691
-What do you want?
-[sighs] Well, I just came here

15:42.774 --> 15:45.444
to get a case of beer
and make fun of you, so one down.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.779
I'm just here for dog food.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.449
-[chuckles]
-Dog food's on aisle seven.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.700
No, it's on six.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.660
Dad, I work here.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.747
For two days.
I've been coming here for 30 years.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.750
Dog food's on six, razors are on eight...

16:00.459 --> 16:05.589
and ten items or less seems to be more
of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule.

16:05.672 --> 16:06.673
[Rooster chuckles]

16:07.341 --> 16:09.969
[inhales deeply] Oh, man...

16:12.096 --> 16:14.056
what a fucking day.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.810
Dude, you can't drink beer in here.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.980
All right,
my manager made that very clear.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.066
I'm not drinking it, just sampling it.

16:24.691 --> 16:26.610
How else am I
supposed to know if I like it?

16:26.693 --> 16:28.279
You're gonna get me in trouble.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.658
You serious? We ate an entire
rotisserie chicken in here one time.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.577
That was a pretty good birthday.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.372
[chuckles] Hey, you wanna swing by the bar

16:38.455 --> 16:40.249
and grab drinks tomorrow night
while it's still free?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.127
I can't. I already had to blow off Abby

16:43.210 --> 16:44.920
-to take Heather to the doctor.
-Ooh.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.880
Plus, you're gonna get
plenty more chances.

16:46.963 --> 16:48.465
That offer on the bar fell through.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.841
What's Mom gonna do?

16:49.925 --> 16:52.886
I don't know,
stick around here for a while, I guess.

16:52.969 --> 16:56.140
I tried to talk to her.
[scoffs] All she did was yell at me.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.392
Fuck it. I'm confiscating this.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.897
Man, oh, man.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.736
Things get any tougher for Mom, you know?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.405
She can't sell her bar

17:11.488 --> 17:14.533
and now her son
is stocking shelves at the Safeway.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.911
You know, the hair straighteners
are on aisle eight

17:17.994 --> 17:20.081
if you're sick of looking
like a fucking poodle.

17:20.956 --> 17:21.957
[chuckles softly]

17:22.583 --> 17:23.709
That was a good one.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.964
Oops.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.727
-[screams]
-[screams] Whoa!

17:41.810 --> 17:43.145
You scared the shit out of me!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.730
What the hell are you doing on the couch?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.983
[sighs] I was trying to stay up
until you got home.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.986
Aw, that's sweet.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.907
I even cooked you a lasagna,
but I fell asleep and it burned.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.077
Do you know none of the smoke alarms
work in this house?

17:58.160 --> 18:02.331
Oh, yeah, my dad claims he can detect
the smoke before they can.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.169
Well, there is a black brick of lasagna
in the trash that says he can't.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.921
[groans]

18:10.464 --> 18:11.590
[sighs]

18:12.883 --> 18:13.884
[exhales]

18:14.468 --> 18:16.178
Is this gonna be the rest of our lives?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.263
Hmm.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.476
I just started this job and we're already
like two shits passing in the night.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.773
Did you just say, "Two shits"? It's two...

18:27.856 --> 18:29.441
You know what? Yes, we are.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.862
But hey, we've got Friday.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.449
-Yeah.
-Yeah...

18:39.410 --> 18:40.619
Friday.

18:44.873 --> 18:45.874
About that.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.626
What?

18:47.709 --> 18:50.671
I promised Heather
I'd take her to the doctor on Friday.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.426
-Seriously? What about our plans?
-Sorry. I know, but--

18:55.509 --> 18:58.387
I made a sex playlist on Spotify.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.972
I just...

19:01.056 --> 19:02.098
She asked...

19:02.183 --> 19:03.892
And then she said
we're supposed to find out

19:03.975 --> 19:06.019
whether or not it's a boy or girl.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.479
You know, hopefully it's a boy.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.607
But either way, you know, boy.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.527
Well, of course you should go.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.654
-It's just...
-Are you mad?

19:15.737 --> 19:17.113
No, I'm...

19:17.906 --> 19:20.867
-disappointed.
-Aw, that's even worse!

19:20.951 --> 19:23.287
It's fine, okay.
I wanted to hang out with you, that's all.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.705
-I'm sorry.
-But we can't. So whatever.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.582
We'll just go to bed.
We're both tired.

19:27.874 --> 19:29.168
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.420
Nah, it's fine.
We'll talk about it in the morning.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.964
Do I smell smoke?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.434
Hey, Ma, can I talk to you?

19:46.017 --> 19:48.437
Oh. Can it wait?
It's been a really long day.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.316
I just want to finish up, smoke a joint,
eat a whole pan of brownies.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.528
You know, you could save some time,
you combine those last two things.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.239
Well, that's a dangerous game.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.366
'Cause the higher you get,
the more brownies you want,

20:00.449 --> 20:01.492
and before you know it,

20:01.575 --> 20:03.910
you're buying a fucking buffalo
to put in your bar.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.496
[laughs]

20:06.747 --> 20:07.789
So, what's up?

20:07.873 --> 20:10.667
Oh, so, uh,
I went over to see Colt at Safeway,

20:10.751 --> 20:13.420
you know, mostly 'cause
I wanted to see him in an apron.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.341
That was a great call,
'cause he looked fucking stupid.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.676
And that's why you came over?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.513
I mean, that would be enough, but, no.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.015
He, uh...
He told me the offer fell through.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.475
So, I got a plan.

20:26.558 --> 20:31.021
Look, he already had that idea.
There's no one's ass to kick.

20:31.938 --> 20:33.774
First of all,
there's always someone's ass to kick.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.237
And second, I don't need to,
because I'm gonna take over the bar.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.072
We talked about this. You're a rancher.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.575
Ma, the point is you sacrificed
your whole life for us, all right?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.993
It's about time we do something for you.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.913
Aw, you don't know how sweet
that is to hear, but I--

20:47.996 --> 20:50.541
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There are no buts, okay?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.251
Now you were the best mom.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.628
You used to let us sneak
into R-rated movies.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.588
You looked the other way
when you found my  Playboys.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.508
You pretended not to notice

20:59.591 --> 21:02.678
when we were re-filling the Jack Daniels
bottle full of apple juice.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.847
[stutters] What?
I never did any of those things.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.600
And you just described a horrible mother.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.188
Don't matter. I'm taking over the bar
and you don't got a say about it.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.693
Rooster, I can't let you give up
on your dreams so I can chase mine. No.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.986
Even if ranching is my dream,

21:20.070 --> 21:23.073
being given a building full of alcohol
is a very close second.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.160
Now, I'm taking over the bar.

21:27.243 --> 21:28.995
You don't like it,
I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.497
[laughs]

21:32.583 --> 21:34.418
Like you could kick my ass.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.588
So, can I take over the bar?

21:38.755 --> 21:39.923
I guess you are.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.092
[Hank] Hold on.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.844
I'm not sure I like this.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.474
Well, how 'bout we celebrate
with a free beer?

21:49.015 --> 21:50.976
But then, life moves on.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.938
[whistling]

22:03.655 --> 22:06.157
Hmm. Got a little kick.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.285
Oh.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.913
Oh, my.

22:13.039 --> 22:14.583
[pants]

22:15.376 --> 22:16.918
[grunts]

22:17.002 --> 22:18.044
Colt, are you okay?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.212
Huh?

22:19.295 --> 22:21.507
[grunts] Oh, yeah.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.841
[scoffs]

22:22.924 --> 22:25.386
I just, uh, ate a pepper.
Wasn't even hot.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.638
What're you doing here?

22:27.721 --> 22:31.392
Well, I figured we couldn't
make time after work, so...

22:31.475 --> 22:33.268
maybe we can make time during work.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.523
And I just... I felt bad for getting pissy
about the doctor's appointment.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.315
That's so sweet.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.985
[chuckles] Well,
if you were the type of guy

22:42.069 --> 22:44.279
to blow something like that off,
I wouldn't want to be with you.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.531
[Colt] Mmm...

22:47.616 --> 22:49.367
So, when's your break?

22:49.451 --> 22:53.121
Oh, fuck! Fuck, that is spicy. Whoo!

22:53.204 --> 22:54.372
-Really?
-Yeah!

22:54.456 --> 22:56.417
I hardly felt it. [clears throat]

22:56.500 --> 22:57.626
[chuckles] Shut up.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.961
A break...
I... I gotta put these cucumbers out.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.463
-All right.
-Yeah.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.218
All right, I'm done.
[sighs] What do you wanna do?

23:08.219 --> 23:09.220
Well...

23:11.139 --> 23:13.016
does the break room have
a lock on the door?

23:14.142 --> 23:15.310
It does.

23:15.393 --> 23:16.853
Do you know what I'm thinking?

23:17.646 --> 23:19.355
Pretty sure you're thinking about sex,

23:19.440 --> 23:21.858
but I'm afraid it's one of them
situations where I say, "Sex,"

23:21.942 --> 23:23.652
and then you say,
"Is everything about sex to you?"

23:23.735 --> 23:25.904
-And then I gotta act like I was kidding.
-It's sex.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.824
Abby, come on.
Is everything about sex to you?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.075
[laughs]

23:33.620 --> 23:35.246
Fuck, that's hot!

23:35.330 --> 23:37.458
-Whoo. [laughs]
-And it's about to get hotter.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.715
I'm sorry,
I really thought that door was locked.

23:44.798 --> 23:45.966
It's fine.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.552
It was their fault, really.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.471
I mean,
who throws a surprise retirement party

23:50.554 --> 23:52.055
without telling the entire staff?

23:53.599 --> 23:55.934
I never want to show my face
in there ever again.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.728
I doubt anyone saw your face, Ab.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.145
[chuckles]

24:02.524 --> 24:06.194
Well, got the rest of the night off,
what do you wanna do?

24:06.987 --> 24:10.198
Well, school is two blocks from here.

24:11.282 --> 24:13.409
Pretty sure the teachers' lounge is empty.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.581
I don't think I've ever said this before,
but let's go to school!

24:17.664 --> 24:18.915
[laughs]

24:26.047 --> 24:27.048
Hey.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.967
What're you doing here?

24:29.050 --> 24:32.220
Well, I came to return your mother's ring.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.223
'Cause I still remember at the wedding
when she said,

24:35.306 --> 24:39.728
"This ring stays in the Bennett family
whether you do or not." Charming toast.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.023
Okay.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.358
So, I'm leaving tomorrow.

24:45.441 --> 24:46.735
Good luck to you.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.612
Really? That's all you have to say?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.238
What do you want me to say?

24:50.321 --> 24:53.366
You're running off with some musician
like a damn teenager.

24:53.449 --> 24:55.619
I tried to get you
to go with me last time,

24:55.702 --> 24:56.828
but you didn't want to leave.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.664
This town isn't good enough for you?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.457
There's more to the world than this town.

25:02.417 --> 25:07.255
God. Once in your fucking life,
why can't you just be supportive?

25:07.338 --> 25:09.424
Because I don't want you to leave.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.595
Okay, well, when's it gonna matter
what I want?

25:13.679 --> 25:16.431
I don't know what life
looks like without you.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.517
I mean, we get separated.
And now divorced.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.728
But you were always close by.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.774
You're the one I'd come talk to
when times got tough.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.193
I mean, who am I going to disagree with?

25:28.276 --> 25:30.070
Well, you disagree with everyone.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.362
No, I don't.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.240
Beau, I'm not dying.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.994
I'll be back when the baby's born.
I have friends here,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.538
and Lord knows I'm gonna have
to check in on the boys.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.457
And believe it or not,

25:42.540 --> 25:46.252
I'm gonna wanna see
your cranky old ass once in a while.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.048
I still think you're making a mistake.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.718
Oh, that was another thing
your mother said in the toast.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.679
Just so you know...

25:56.597 --> 25:58.139
I'm not doing this for a man.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.017
I did that once.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.270
When I left Nebraska for Colorado

26:04.354 --> 26:07.023
to come live with a tall,
skinny rancher...

26:08.066 --> 26:09.651
who voted for Jimmy Carter.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.946
Even though to this day
will not admit it.

26:14.865 --> 26:18.534
If I had the chance to do it again,
I'd do it the exact same way.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.039
Except for letting your mom talk
at the wedding.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.169
I wouldn't change anything either.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.297
Except for voting for Carter.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.594
Do you really want this?

26:37.178 --> 26:38.554
I do, Beau.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.977
I'm gonna miss you, Mags.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.771
I'm gonna miss you, too.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.148
And I love you, Beau.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.942
I love you, too.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.154
[sighs]

26:56.114 --> 26:59.200
Also, um,
the offer fell through on the bar,

26:59.284 --> 27:01.745
so Rooster is gonna
stop working here to run it.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.246
What?

27:03.329 --> 27:04.665
Okay, bye!

27:11.462 --> 27:12.463
I'm so sorry.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.299
I had no idea the janitor
was gonna be there.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.219
Why the fuck did he try to join in?

27:20.430 --> 27:21.890
It's a lonely job.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.606
All right, check it out.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.442
First official pour as a bartender.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.526
[chuckles]

27:34.277 --> 27:36.988
Who would've thought
I'd be slinging drinks for a living?

27:37.823 --> 27:41.242
I feel like you've been training for it
your whole life.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.495
Yeah, I was a bit of a child prodigy.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.456
[inhales deeply]

27:46.539 --> 27:48.208
So, you're not mad?

27:48.291 --> 27:50.168
Nah, I'm tired of fighting.

27:51.419 --> 27:54.172
You're making your mom happy
and that's a good thing.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.465
Seems like a trap, but I'll take it.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.013
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.139
What's going on?

28:03.849 --> 28:05.934
Why are you guys toasting?
Were you making fun of me?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.439
Huh. Dad...

28:11.522 --> 28:13.024
did you change your will?

28:14.442 --> 28:17.528
Nope. Still leaving everything
to the fucking dog.

28:19.655 --> 28:20.698
What are you doing here?

28:21.324 --> 28:23.243
Saying goodbye. I'm leaving tomorrow.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.621
What? I thought the offer
on the bar fell through.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.499
Yeah, it did. I'm taking it over,
so she can get out of here.

28:29.582 --> 28:33.378
You know, some would say best son,
some would say favorite.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.672
But the headline will read,

28:36.757 --> 28:39.801
"Jameson 'the Rooster' Bennett,
motherfucking hero."

28:42.012 --> 28:45.891
Yeah, so, everyone's just okay
with Mom abandoning us?

28:45.974 --> 28:48.643
I mean, I'm not excited about it
like when you left.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.521
Why are you enabling this shit?

28:51.604 --> 28:55.150
Dude, I'm running a bar now.
I'm gonna be enabling all kinds of shit.

28:57.944 --> 29:00.196
Did you hear anything
I said to you earlier?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.824
No, I heard you,
but I don't have to like it.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.659
It's not up to us.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.620
Yeah, hit him, Mom. He deserves it.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.540
I know this isn't what you want.

29:10.623 --> 29:13.794
No, it's not. Right now
is not a good time for you to go.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.171
Well... [scoffs]
But that's just the thing, Colt,

29:16.254 --> 29:18.256
there'll always be a reason not to go.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.258
A baby, a wedding,

29:20.341 --> 29:22.468
Rooster screwing up at the bar.

29:23.845 --> 29:27.348
But all those things
will also be reasons to come back.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.643
[sighs] Look, you don't have to like it.

29:31.686 --> 29:36.441
I'd just feel a whole lot better leaving
if I didn't think you hated me.

29:37.608 --> 29:40.320
I don't hate you. I'll never hate you.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.571
I just...

29:41.654 --> 29:44.574
I'm not gonna apologize for wanting
to have my mom in my life.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.162
Okay, I'll take that.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.414
Let's drink some fucking whiskey.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.794
Finally something we can all agree on.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.755
All right.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.801
To the Bennetts,
the best goddamn family in Colorado,

30:02.884 --> 30:04.427
and to their best son.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.346
[clicks tongue]

30:06.429 --> 30:08.849
Even when we're apart,
we're always together.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.933
[Rooster chuckles]

30:12.393 --> 30:13.895
[cell phone ringing]

30:15.563 --> 30:16.606
[grunts]

30:18.774 --> 30:20.944
Hey, Mary, uh, now is not really a good--

30:23.696 --> 30:24.739
Is everything okay?

30:26.616 --> 30:28.451
-What happened?
-[glass thuds]

30:28.534 --> 30:30.745
Oh, fuck, yeah, I'll be...
I'll be right there.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.456
Everything okay?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.459
Uh, Heather's in the hospital.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.962
-What?
-There's something wrong with the baby.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.714
Thought you saw her today at the doctor.

30:41.797 --> 30:45.135
I did. Everything was fine.
I... I don't know what's going on.

30:46.552 --> 30:48.554
[country music playing]
