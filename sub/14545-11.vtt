WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:04.338
(Tessa) IF SOMEBODY PUT
A GUN TO MY HEAD

00:04.405 --> 00:06.574
AND FORCED ME TO SAY
MY FAVORITE THING

00:06.640 --> 00:08.276
ABOUT THE SUBURBS,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.611
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
IT'S THE WATER PRESSURE.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.413
AFTER ALL, THE WATER DOESN'T
HAVE TO INCH ITS WAY

00:12.480 --> 00:14.515
UP TO THE TENTH FLOOR
LIKE IT DID IN THE CITY.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.750
IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT THERE
WHEN YOU NEED IT--

00:16.817 --> 00:20.854
GUSHING, POWERFUL, HOT...

00:20.921 --> 00:23.191
(drain gurgles)

00:23.257 --> 00:25.626
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

00:25.693 --> 00:27.895
(water drops)

00:27.961 --> 00:29.397
YOUR WATER SHUT OFF, TOO?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.199
I STILL HAVE SHAMPOO
IN MY HAIR.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.900
TRUST ME,
I HAVE A WORSE SITUATION

00:32.966 --> 00:34.202
INVOLVING SOFT SOAP.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.636
WELL, SHOULD WE CALL
THE SUPER?

00:35.703 --> 00:36.904
I AM THE SUPER!

00:36.970 --> 00:37.938
(doorbell rings)

00:38.005 --> 00:39.307
(water gushing)

00:39.373 --> 00:40.074
OKAY.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.376
HEY. UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:42.443 --> 00:44.178
I TOLD YOU HE HAD
A GOOD BUILD.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.513
I STAND CORRECTED.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.248
(chuckles) OKAY. WHAT, UH,
CAN I--CAN I HELP YOU?

00:47.315 --> 00:49.250
BAD NEWS, GEORGE. SOMEBODY RAN
OVER THE FIRE HYDRANT

00:49.317 --> 00:50.618
ON YOUR FRONT LAWN.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.220
OKAY, WE--WE DON'T HAVE
A FIRE HYDRANT

00:52.286 --> 00:53.487
ON OUR FRONT LAWN.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.488
WELL, YOU DO NOW.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.056
(chuckles)

00:56.124 --> 00:57.658
UH...

00:57.725 --> 00:59.727
(sighs)

00:59.793 --> 01:00.861
OH.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.596
(water gushing)

01:02.663 --> 01:04.198
WOW.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.436
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:08.502 --> 01:13.507
(Alih Jay) * LAST NIGHT I HAD
A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

01:13.574 --> 01:16.310
* DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA, DA, DA, DA *

01:16.377 --> 01:17.678
THIS IS A FIRST
FOR CHATSWIN HIGH,

01:17.745 --> 01:20.381
HAVING AN UNDERCOVER NARC
ON THE PREMISES.

01:20.448 --> 01:24.352
IT'S VERY EXCITING.
IT'S LIKE "THE WIRE"!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.086
I DON'T KNOW
HOW EXCITING IT IS

01:26.154 --> 01:28.856
THAT KIDS ARE USING
AND DISTRIBUTING STEROIDS.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.458
VERY...

01:30.524 --> 01:32.226
(lowered voice) BUT I PROMISE
TO KEEP THIS SHIZZLE ON THE D.L.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.129
SO'S I DON'T BLOW UP
YOUR SPOT.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.330
I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.631
NOW I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU

01:37.698 --> 01:39.500
INTO THE SCHOOL POPULATION
THE WAY I INTRODUCE

01:39.567 --> 01:43.003
EVERY NEW STUDENT--
BY ASSIGNING YOU A BUDDY.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.672
TESSA!

01:44.738 --> 01:47.107
TESSA!

01:47.175 --> 01:49.943
(telephone ringing)

01:50.010 --> 01:51.912
THIS IS JOSH SHERMAN.

01:51.979 --> 01:56.016
JOSH IS A NEW STUDENT HERE
AT OUR SCHOOL,

01:56.083 --> 01:57.918
AND SINCE YOU'RE
OUR MOST RECENT ADDITION

01:57.985 --> 01:59.220
TO CHATSWIN, I COULDN'T THINK

01:59.287 --> 02:01.121
OF ANYONE BETTER
TO SHOW JOSH THE ROPES.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.723
ARE YOU SURE?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.159
I'M STILL LOOKING FOR ONE
TO HANG MYSELF WITH.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.995
(laughs) SHE'S SO WRY.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.498
(bell rings)

02:10.564 --> 02:12.633
MOVING HERE FROM A CITY
IS CHALLENGING AT FIRST.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.968
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
YOU'VE GOT TO GET USED TO.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.404
LIKE WHAT?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.707
WHO'S THIS LOSER?

02:19.773 --> 02:20.674
I'M JOSH.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.843
IS TESSA SHOWING YOU
AROUND LOSERTOWN?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.646
WELL, IF THIS IS LOSERTOWN,

02:25.713 --> 02:28.749
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE YOU A LOSER?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.519
OH, WOW. LOGIC.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.391
IS EVERYBODY LIKE--
MOST.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.160
MOST.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.363
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
MANHATTAN COST A FORTUNE.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.498
THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE DAY
SINCE I MOVED HERE THAT

02:44.565 --> 02:48.502
SOMETHING HASN'T BROKEN DOWN
OR NEEDED PAINTING OR CAULKING

02:48.569 --> 02:51.439
OR WEATHER-STRIPPING
OR RESURFACING.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.541
SOUNDS LIKE MY WIFE.
(laughs) I'M JUST KIDDING.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.244
JILL LOOKS GREAT
FOR A WOMAN IN HER 40s.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.412
(laughs) I'M JUST JOKING.

02:58.479 --> 03:02.149
I MARRIED TOO YOUNG.
(laughs) STOP ME!

03:02.216 --> 03:04.552
(chuckles)

03:04.618 --> 03:06.220
(mouths word)

03:06.287 --> 03:09.290
(lowered voice) AND THAT IS
MY OTHER PROBLEM.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.758
DALLAS?
YEAH.

03:10.824 --> 03:14.695
LOOK AT THE WAY SHE'S SMILING
AT ME. (clears throat)

03:14.762 --> 03:17.431
THAT'S THE WAY SHE SMILES
AT EVERYBODY.

03:17.498 --> 03:21.335
LOOK AT THE WAY
SHE'S EATING THAT BANANA.

03:21.402 --> 03:25.439
(man) * THIS IS YOUR FANTASY

03:25.506 --> 03:27.541
THAT'S THE WAY
SHE EATS EVERYTHING.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.277
WHAT? NO, IT IS NOT.
TRUST ME.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.312
THINGS HAVE BEEN WEIRD
EVER SINCE SHE KISSED ME.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.315
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA
AND WAIT AND WHAT AND HUH?

03:34.382 --> 03:35.616
SHE KISSED YOU? WHERE?

03:35.683 --> 03:36.417
ON THE LIPS.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.551
NO, WHERE IN THE WORLD?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.819
OH, AT MY HOUSE
ON CHRISTMAS.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.020
I TOLD YOU THAT.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.855
(chuckles) YOU MOST CERTAINLY
DID NOT TELL ME THAT.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.992
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT.
SHE'S SMOKIN' HOT!

03:45.058 --> 03:45.959
SHE'S MARRIED.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.761
WHICH MAKES IT HOTTER.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.463
YOUR WIFE'S MARRIED.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.732
YEAH,
BUT SHE'S MARRIED TO ME.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.534
LISA, THIS IS JOSH.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.569
HE JUST MOVED HERE
FROM CHICAGO.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.637
HI, LISA.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.476
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO CHICAGO,
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF THE MUSICAL

04:02.543 --> 04:04.778
AND FOUND QUEEN LATIFAH TO BE
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE

04:04.845 --> 04:07.748
IN THE MOVIE VERSION.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.818
NICE MEETING YOU.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.322
I THINK I HAVE A SHOT
WITH HIM.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.989
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.658
'CAUSE HE HASN'T HAD TIME
TO FORM AN OPINION ABOUT ME

04:17.725 --> 04:19.893
BASED ON WHAT
EVERYONE ELSE THINKS.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.763
JUST DO ME A FAVOR AND PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.898
JUST, I DON'T KNOW,
TELL HIM I'M NICE

04:24.965 --> 04:27.601
AND SMART AND...

04:27.668 --> 04:29.937
(Lisa)
AND NOT RELATED TO HIM.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.906
**

04:32.973 --> 04:35.509
TELL HIM I'M ADOPTED.

04:35.576 --> 04:39.613
I THINK I LEFT MY CAR KEYS.
(slurping)

04:39.680 --> 04:40.681
(jangling)

04:40.748 --> 04:41.615
OH.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.684
LOOKIN' FOR THESE, DADDY?
OH!

04:43.751 --> 04:44.818
OH. (chuckles)

04:44.885 --> 04:46.153
DALLAS.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.921
MR. SNEAKY-FACE TRIED TO SNEAK
OUT WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.791
NO, ACTUALLY, MR.
I-DIDN'T-WANT-TO-BOTHER-YOU-FACE

04:50.858 --> 04:52.693
DIDN'T WANT
TO... BOTHER YOU.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.127
WELL, I WANT YOU
TO BOTHER ME, GEORGE.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.529
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

04:55.596 --> 04:59.767
I DO KNOW THAT, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.003
I THINK
YOU AND I SHOULD TALK.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.037
SO TALK.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.473
WELL, NOT HERE.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.108
THIS CLUB IS FULL OF BUSYBODIES
AND NUDGY-NOSES.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.310
(lowered voice)
THIS IS PRIVATE.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.312
(normal voice)
I'LL CALL YOU.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.648
(sighs)

05:17.718 --> 05:20.053
SHE STILL HAS MY CAR KEYS.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.155
(latch clicks)
SO, JOSH, YOU REMEMBER
THAT GIRL LISA

05:22.222 --> 05:23.557
I INTRODUCED YOU TO
YESTERDAY?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.158
(latch clicks)
NOPE.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.360
YOU KNOW,
KINDA DIRTY BLONDE HAIR,

05:26.427 --> 05:28.762
HAZEL BROWN EYES,
LOVES QUEEN LATIFAH.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.330
OHH.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.265
LISA.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.867
NO.

05:33.934 --> 05:34.502
JOSH.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.003
(locker door closes)

05:36.069 --> 05:40.741
SHE'S SUPER NICE AND SMART
AND... ADOPTED,

05:40.808 --> 05:43.010
IF YOU'RE INTO THAT SORT
OF THING,

05:43.076 --> 05:46.947
WHICH SOME PEOPLE... ARE.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.849
WHO'S THAT?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.551
WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAD SPENT ENOUGH TIME

05:50.618 --> 05:52.085
IN THE WEST VILLAGE
TO RECOGNIZE THAT LOOK.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.623
THAT LOOK MEANT JOSH
WAS NEVER GONNA LIKE LISA

05:55.689 --> 05:57.057
BECAUSE JOSH WAS GAY,

05:57.124 --> 06:00.060
AND IT WAS,
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD...

06:00.127 --> 06:01.895
(singsongy) FABULOUS.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.337
WHATCHA DOIN'?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.305
STUDYING FOR A SPANISH TEST.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.408
OH. WELL, IF YOU'RE STUCK
ON "CEILING,"

06:14.475 --> 06:17.177
I THINK IT'S EL TECHO...

06:17.244 --> 06:18.512
OR IS THAT ARMPIT?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.848
SO THIS NEW GUY STARTED
AT CHATSWIN TODAY.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.749
YEAH?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.951
HE'S SUPER NICE, REAL GAY,

06:24.017 --> 06:26.687
BUT I THINK HE'S IN THE CLOSET,
WHICH IS BUMMING ME OUT.

06:26.754 --> 06:29.322
RIGHT, BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS
TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHO THEY ARE.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.424
EXACTLY.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.959
HAVE YOU MET PEOPLE?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.428
VERY FEW OF THEM ARE COMPLETELY
HONEST ABOUT WHO THEY ARE.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.163
I AM.
THEN YOU'D HAVE NO PROBLEM

06:36.229 --> 06:38.899
WITH PEOPLE KNOWING YOU DVR
"FOR THE LOVE OF RAY J."?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.470
(whispers)
WE ALL HAVE OUR SECRETS.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.938
(cell phone rings)

06:45.005 --> 06:46.139
(sighs)

06:46.206 --> 06:48.275
(ring)

06:48.341 --> 06:50.478
UGH. (sighs)

06:50.544 --> 06:54.748
Â¿TU NO SABER POR TELEFONO...
DECIR SALUDO?

06:54.815 --> 06:59.152
NON, PARCE QU'ELLE QUI APPELLE
QUI VEUT LES SEXUELS AVEC MOI.

07:02.255 --> 07:06.359
I TOOK FRENCH.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.761
(Dallas) SQUEEZE IT.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.396
YOU GOTTA SQUEEZE IT, GEORGE.
HMM?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.499
(woman over P.A.)
NO WAITING ON CHECKSTAND 2.

07:11.565 --> 07:15.402
OH. HEY, DALLAS.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.204
NOT REALLY.
I FOLLOWED YOU HERE.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.772
YEAH?
HERE. FEEL THESE.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.541
FEEL MY MELONS.
OKAY.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.110
SEE HOW FULL THEY FEEL
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.245
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
THEY'RE JUICY AND READY TO EAT.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.080
OKAY, YOU KNOW, I-I DON'T
THINK I'M GONNA GET

07:27.147 --> 07:31.084
ANY MELONS ANYWAY,
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.321
GEORGE, I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
AND YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED,

07:34.387 --> 07:37.591
AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
MAYBE YOU'RE AVOIDING ME.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.460
AVOIDING YOU? THAT'S CRAZY.
I--WHY WOULD I--

07:40.528 --> 07:41.762
I-I WOULDN'T. I'M NOT.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.097
GOOD, 'CAUSE I HAVE
A PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.398
I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU

07:45.465 --> 07:47.167
TO DESIGN MY BOUTIQUE.
DALLAS,
YOU ARE A MARRIED WOMAN!

07:47.234 --> 07:52.072
(Muzak playing)

07:52.139 --> 07:53.440
(sighs)

07:53.507 --> 07:54.975
WHAT DOES MY BEING MARRIED
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

07:55.042 --> 07:56.577
WITH YOU DESIGNING
MY BOUTIQUE?
NO, NO. NOTHING. NOTHING.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.345
NOTHING. I-I JUST THINK
THE TWO OF US--

07:58.411 --> 08:00.213
OH, LOOK WHO IT IS!
(thuds)

08:00.280 --> 08:01.214
GOLDEN RAISINS.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.550
GEORGE.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.417
(man) MANAGER TO REGISTER 4,
PLEASE.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.786
WOULD YOU LIKE A COUPON
FOR GROUND CHUCK?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.154
NO, THANKS. I'M FINE.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.289
TAKE THE COUPON, GEORGE.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.858
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

08:10.924 --> 08:13.360
IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA HIT YOU
WHERE IT HURTS, RIGHT IN THE--

08:13.426 --> 08:14.394
CINNAMON ROLLS.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.462
WHAT?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.030
GEORGE, THAT GEYSER
ON YOUR LAWN

08:17.097 --> 08:19.132
CAUSED EXTENSIVE WATER DAMAGE
TO OUR DRIVEWAY.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.769
AND, SADLY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HAVE THE WHOLE THING REPAVED.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.137
OOH, THAT SOUNDS
EXPENSIVE, GEORGE.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.374
OH, IT WILL BE, AND IF GEORGE
DOESN'T PAY FOR IT, WE'LL SUE.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.709
DON'T WANT TO.
BUT WE WILL.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.278
THE SHAYS ARE
A LITIGIOUS PEOPLE.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.580
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
GEORGE?

08:32.646 --> 08:34.247
HALF PRICE
ON YOUR GROUND CHUCK

08:34.314 --> 08:36.383
OR DESIGN MY BOUTIQUE?

08:36.449 --> 08:39.286
(woman) DELI, LINE 1.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.287
WHEN DO I START?

08:40.353 --> 08:42.289
(bell ringing)

08:42.355 --> 08:46.359
(indistinct conversations)

08:46.426 --> 08:48.328
HEY! TESSA.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.529
DO YOU KNOW RYAN SHAY?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.231
AFTER ALL THIS TIME
IN SUBURBIA,

08:51.298 --> 08:55.368
MY GAYDAR WAS STILL AS FINELY
TUNED AS LIBERACE'S PIANO.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.171
YEAH. I KNOW RYAN. WHY?

08:58.238 --> 09:00.608
I DON'T KNOW. JUST...
SEEMS KINDA POPULAR.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.409
MAYBE THE SORTA GUY
I SHOULD KINDA GET TO KNOW.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.311
SORTA KINDA, HUH?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.579
YEAH.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.716
BECAUSE HE'S... "POPULAR."
(chuckles)

09:08.782 --> 09:10.818
YEAH.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.253
LOOK, JOSH,
YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.556
THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE YOU.
I'M FROM NEW YORK.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.594
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.162
FINE, FINE.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.132
I WON'T ASK,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.600
(under breath)
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

09:26.667 --> 09:27.835
YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE

09:27.901 --> 09:29.169
AS FAR AS RYAN SHAY
IS CONCERNED.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.673
HE IS... (click teeth)
STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.474
BUT HIS BODY...

09:34.541 --> 09:35.909
IT'S SO MUSCULAR.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.312
I KNOW. AND THAT'S USUALLY
A TELLTALE SIGN, BUT--

09:39.379 --> 09:41.749
OH, MY GOD. YOU DO KNOW.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.821
YOU CAN'T OUT ME.
I WON'T.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.089
NOBODY'S EVER
FIGURED IT OUT BEFORE.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.323
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
IF EVERYONE KNEW,

09:50.390 --> 09:51.625
AND IT WAS ALL
OUT IN THE OPEN?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.293
WHAT? NO! ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT WOULD RUIN ME.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.462
MAN, I WISH THE WORLD
WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.031
YEAH! (scoffs)

09:58.098 --> 09:59.499
OKAY, SO RYAN SHAY'S
NOT MY GUY.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.736
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
WORTH CHECKING OUT?

10:02.803 --> 10:06.406
I DO HAVE THE SNEAKY SUSPICION
OF DAVE DONSKY.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.574
SCHOOL QUARTERBACK?

10:07.641 --> 10:10.310
DONSKY. GOT IT.

10:10.377 --> 10:14.648
I'LL SNIFF AROUND,
SEE WHAT HE'S INTO.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.118
NOT A WORD TO ANYONE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.086
THANKS, TESSA.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.553
(slaps arm)

10:20.620 --> 10:21.889
(sighs)

10:21.955 --> 10:24.658
I GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS CLOSET.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.960
(bell ringing)

10:32.933 --> 10:35.502
SO I SAW YOU AND JOSH
TALKING YESTERDAY.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.437
YOU THINK HE LIKES ME?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.106
ALMOST.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.440
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:40.507 --> 10:42.776
HE LIKES YOUR BROTHER.
JOSH IS GAY?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.912
WE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.615
JOSH CAN'T BE GAY.
THE GUY WHO CARVES OUR MEAT...

10:48.682 --> 10:49.750
* TA-DA

10:49.817 --> 10:52.352
NOW HE'S GAY, BUT JOSH?

10:52.419 --> 10:53.721
EASY TO SPOT
THE OBVIOUS ONES.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.990
YOU'RE FORGETTING ABOUT GUYS
LIKE DAVE DONSKY.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.492
THE QUARTERBACK? HE'S THE MOST
MASCULINE GUY IN SCHOOL.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.660
GAY.
NOT GAY.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.429
CLAY AIKEN-GAY.
CLAY AIKEN'S NOT GAY.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.097
HE'S JUST A TENDER SOUL.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.467
LISA, HE'S OPENLY GAY.
HE'S AS GAY AS JOSH...

11:07.534 --> 11:08.769
WHO IS GAY.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.870
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.538
JOSH IS MY DESTINY.
I KNOW HE IS.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.707
I'VE ALREADY GONE ONLINE
AND ORDERED COMPUTER RENDERINGS

11:13.774 --> 11:18.011
OF WHAT OUR FUTURE CHILDREN
WILL LOOK LIKE.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.813
WHERE DID YOU OBTAIN
THIS PHOTOS?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.314
BuildMyBabies.com.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.616
THE LITTLE BOY LOOKS LIKE
A SERIAL KILLER.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.219
WHO, LOSH?
HE'S JUST MISUNDERSTOOD.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.620
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE

11:27.687 --> 11:28.756
TO PROCREATE WITH.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.390
JOSH IS PLAYING
FOR THE OTHER TEAM.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.025
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

11:32.092 --> 11:36.563
IT'S DRAFT SEASON, AND I PREDICT
JOSH WILL SWITCH TEAMS.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.831
I CAN TURN HIM.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.233
I AM BALLSY ENOUGH TO TRY.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.803
I'M SURE JOSH WILL LIKE
THAT QUALITY.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.837
UHH! YOU THE MAN.

11:43.904 --> 11:44.938
NO, YOU THE MAN.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.740
(both) UHH!
YOU THE MAN, MAN!

11:46.807 --> 11:47.775
YOU THE MAN, TOO, MAN.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.210
COME ON, MAN.
(boys grunt)

11:50.277 --> 11:51.244
WHOO!

11:51.311 --> 11:53.580
(all grunting)

11:53.646 --> 11:55.448
(yelling)

11:55.515 --> 11:57.484
(telephone ringing)

11:57.550 --> 11:59.086
MR. WOLFE,
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.589
ABSOLUTELY. I'M JUST BIDDING
ON A "PERFECT STRANGERS" BOX SET

12:02.655 --> 12:04.457
AND...
(taps key)

12:04.524 --> 12:09.029
I'M ALL YOURS. I'M NOT SURE
THEY REALLY WERE COUSINS.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.198
WHO KNOWS?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.333
ANYWAY...

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
I FEEL SORT OF EMBARRASSED
COMING TO YOU ABOUT THIS,

12:15.468 --> 12:20.573
BUT... I HAVE THIS FRIEND
WHO'S ASHAMED TO BE GAY,

12:20.640 --> 12:23.643
AND... REFUSES
TO COME OUT.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.513
LET ME GUESS. IT'S YOU.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.481
NO, IT'S A FRIEND.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.850
IT ALWAYS IS.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.885
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME

12:31.952 --> 12:35.155
HOW... YOU HANDLED IT.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.224
HANDLED WHAT?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.291
COMING OUT.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.693
FROM INDIANA?
OH, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.031
I JUST PACKED SOME BAGS
AND JUMPED ON A BUS.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.000
UH...

12:47.067 --> 12:48.001
OKAY.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.137
BUT LET'S GET BACK
TO YOUR "FRIEND."

12:50.203 --> 12:51.872
RIGHT. UH...

12:51.939 --> 12:53.440
HE JUST SEEMS LIKE
SUCH A GREAT GUY,

12:53.506 --> 12:58.111
AND... I KNOW HE'LL NEVER BE
HAPPY LIVING A LIE.

12:58.178 --> 13:02.049
(opens drawer)
IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY
TO MY G.F., HEIDI.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.385
"HEIDI, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE BEING
HETEROSEXUAL WITH YOU.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.387
"BUT IF FOR SOME REASON
YOU'RE NOT FEELING IT,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.522
"JUST LET ME KNOW
SO I CAN FIND ANOTHER WOMAN

13:09.589 --> 13:13.360
TO BE HETEROSEXUAL WITH,
BECAUSE I HAVE NEEDS."

13:13.426 --> 13:16.830
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.231
I JUST WISH MY FRIEND
WOULD REALIZE

13:18.298 --> 13:21.134
THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T
ACCEPT YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE

13:21.201 --> 13:22.769
AREN'T WORTH KNOWING ANYWAY.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.337
TOTALLY.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.206
ISN'T SHE GORGEOUS?
SHE'S A VIRGO.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.077
OH, GEORGE.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.580
DOESN'T THIS SPACE
JUST OOZE POTENTIAL?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.015
IT OOZES, ALL RIGHT.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.351
I AM FINALLY READY TO SHARE
MY PASSION WITH THE WORLD.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.887
SO WHAT, SHOES? PURSES?

13:39.953 --> 13:43.590
SHOES AND PURSES? HOW SHALLOW
DO YOU THINK I AM?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.592
I'M SELLING PAPERWEIGHTS.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.960
P-P-PAPERWEIGHTS?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.828
OH, NOT JUST PAPERWEIGHTS.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.899
CRYSTAL PAPERWEIGHTS
WITH 3D LASER-ETCHINGS

13:51.965 --> 13:54.234
OF YOUR LOVED ONES.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.068
LOOK.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.436
THIS IS ME AND YAKULT.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.006
SEE HOW IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE HOLOGRAM IN THERE?

13:59.072 --> 14:03.076
HERE'S DALIA.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.046
AND THIS ONE...
(gasps) IS YOU.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.850
OH!

14:10.918 --> 14:13.486
I BET YOUR BRAIN
IS JUST SPINNING,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.855
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
WE CAN DO IN HERE,

14:15.923 --> 14:18.691
ON THE CEILING,
ON THE FLOOR.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.828
(gasps)
UP AGAINST THIS WALL.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.964
OKAY, DALLAS, THAT IS ENOUGH.
BEG PARDON?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.699
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.136
THIS JOB,
THIS... WHOLE STORE--

14:29.202 --> 14:31.071
IT'S AN EXCUSE
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.805
(laughs and gasps)

14:32.872 --> 14:34.441
WELL, SOMEONE'S SELF-ESTEEM
IS INTACT.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.610
OH, COME ON. LASER-ETCHED 3D
CRYSTAL PAPERWEIGHTS?

14:37.677 --> 14:38.745
WHO THE HELL WANTS THOSE?

14:38.811 --> 14:39.879
PEOPLE WHO LOVE
THE SPECTACULAR.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.214
OH, PLEASE.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.550
THE ONLY THING SPECTACULAR HERE
IS THE LENGTHS

14:43.616 --> 14:46.453
YOU ARE WILLING TO GO TO
TRYING TO SEDUCE ME.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.587
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.990
BUT I AM DONE THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO

14:50.057 --> 14:52.459
UP AGAINST THAT WALL.

14:52.525 --> 14:56.896
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT A DISPLAY CASE!

14:56.964 --> 14:59.032
OHH!
(books thud)

14:59.099 --> 15:01.801
SORRY, DUDE. HIGH FIVE.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.070
LISA?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.637
DON'T HARSH ME, DUDE.
HIGH FIVE.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.408
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED--

15:08.475 --> 15:10.243
DRESSED LIKE A MAN?

15:10.310 --> 15:13.346
'CAUSE I... AM THE MAN.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.648
HIGH FIVE.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.651
I DON'T... WANT TO.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.887
THAT'S COOL.

15:20.954 --> 15:21.788
(chuckles)
BYE, LISA.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.791
BYE, BRO.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.727
HEY, TESSA. TESSA.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.662
HEY, I JUST WANTED TO, UH,
THANK YOU

15:29.729 --> 15:31.131
FOR TURNING ME ON TO DAVE.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.432
SO THINGS WORKED OUT?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.167
HMM. ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.936
I'M GONNA NAIL THIS GUY,
TESSA...

15:37.004 --> 15:39.839
TODAY.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.374
TODAY?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.110
DON'T YOU WANNA TAKE THINGS
A LITTLE SLOWER?

15:43.176 --> 15:46.079
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
HE'S THE ONE.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.215
CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY.
IN FACT...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.051
(clenches teeth) DO YOU
WANNA WATCH IT GO DOWN?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.220
WH-WHERE'S IT GONNA GO DOWN?

15:53.286 --> 15:57.790
RIGHT HERE...
IN THE HALLWAY.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.760
RIGHT... NOW.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.696
POLICE. FREEZE!
JUMP HIM!

16:03.763 --> 16:04.897
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.633
(grunts)
(bag thuds)

16:06.699 --> 16:08.401
NARCOTICS DIVISION,
NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.303
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE POSSESSION

16:10.370 --> 16:12.872
AND SALE OF STEROIDS. YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
(handcuffs clicking)

16:12.939 --> 16:14.774
UHH!

16:14.841 --> 16:16.976
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU...

16:17.044 --> 16:19.079
AS I WATCHED IT GO DOWN,

16:19.146 --> 16:20.980
I REALIZED I SHOULDN'T BE
PULLING ANYONE OVER

16:21.048 --> 16:22.649
ON THE HOMOSEXUAL HIGHWAY,

16:22.715 --> 16:25.452
BECAUSE MY GAYDAR
WAS CLEARLY BROKEN.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.424
SO HOW IS
MY FAMOUS CHICKEN PARM?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.692
KIND OF DRY.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.328
WELL, YEAH, THAT--
THAT'S WHAT IT'S FAMOUS FOR.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.797
REMEMBER THAT NEW KID I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT AT SCHOOL?

16:37.864 --> 16:39.132
THE GAY ONE?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.367
TURNS OUT
HE WASN'T SO MUCH GAY

16:40.433 --> 16:42.535
AS HE WAS
AN UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS OFFICER

16:42.602 --> 16:43.936
WHO WASN'T GAY.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.739
A NARC? (laughs)
THEY STILL DO THAT?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.575
(scoffs) APPARENTLY.
WOW.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.877
AND APPARENTLY I'M THE IDIOT FOR
THINKING I UNDERSTOOD THE GUY

16:50.943 --> 16:53.180
WHEN I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.981
I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUMPED
TO A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.850
I FEEL SO STUPID.

16:57.917 --> 17:02.222
YOU'RE NOT STUPID, TESS.
YOU'RE JUST AN ALTMAN.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.857
(TV playing indistinctly)

17:04.924 --> 17:07.860
...ON THE CEILING,
ON THE FLOOR.

17:07.927 --> 17:12.432
OH, WE COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE
RIGHT UP AGAINST THIS WALL.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.300
UH, DALLAS.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.668
OH, GEORGE!
(door closes)

17:15.735 --> 17:18.338
JOE, WHY DON'T YOU GET
THAT BID TO ME A.S.A.P.,

17:18.405 --> 17:21.474
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
EVEN A.S.A.P.er, OKAY?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.111
OKAY, FINE.

17:24.177 --> 17:28.014
HEY.
HEY.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.016
(door opens)
SO JOE SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD GUY.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.884
HE IS.
YOU MUST BE SHOCKED TO SEE

17:31.951 --> 17:33.586
I'M GOING FORWARD
WITH MY STORE...
(door closes)

17:33.653 --> 17:35.688
CONSIDERING IT WAS ALL JUST
A PLOY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.292
OKAY, SO MAYBE I JUMPED
TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.261
I THINK IT'S HEREDITARY.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.863
BUT LOOK, I MEAN, AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED AT CHRISTMAS--

17:43.930 --> 17:48.501
CHRISTMAS?
OH, OF COURSE. THE KISS?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.602
YES, THE KISS.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.771
GEORGE, THAT KISS
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.474
THAT WAS ABOUT ME
AND STEVEN.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.042
HOW SO?

17:56.109 --> 17:58.578
IT'S NO SECRET THINGS AREN'T
PERFECT BETWEEN HIM AND I.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.880
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME
KEEPING MY HEAD DOWN,

18:00.947 --> 18:03.950
JUST CARRYING OUT MY DUTIES
AS A WIFE, AS A MOTHER,

18:04.016 --> 18:05.352
AS A SIZE 2.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.854
SOMETIMES I HAVE
TO REMIND MYSELF TO LOOK UP

18:07.920 --> 18:10.457
AND THINK ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT I WANT, AND THEN I DID,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.226
AND... (sighs)
AND THERE YOU WERE,

18:13.293 --> 18:17.029
STANDING IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME, I GUESS.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.231
I GUESS.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.799
MY MARRIAGE
MAY NOT BE PERFECT,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.602
BUT, GEORGE, I'M FIXING
TO REDISCOVER MYSELF.

18:22.669 --> 18:26.005
I'M FIXING TO LASER-ENGRAVE
MY OWN HAPPINESS

18:26.072 --> 18:28.375
INTO A GLISTENING BALL
OF CRYSTAL.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.810
I'M A STORE OWNER.
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.580
I'M AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN
IN THE 2000-TEENS.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.515
(singsongy) HOLLA!

18:35.582 --> 18:37.217
(normal voice)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.686
THE JOB IS STILL YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.
I WANT IT.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.654
AHH! GEORGE.
(chuckles)

18:41.721 --> 18:43.323
OKAY, I'M GONNA HAVE
MY LAWYER DRAW UP

18:43.390 --> 18:46.159
SOME CONTRACTS
JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
YEP. OKAY.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.460
SO THAT--THAT KISS--

18:47.527 --> 18:50.463
THAT WAS... ABOUT YOU
AND STEVEN, THEN?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.431
YEP.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.833
BECAUSE... I MEAN...
YOU KNOW, IT FELT

18:53.900 --> 18:56.203
LIKE IT WAS
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.605
NO. IT WASN'T.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.587
(switch clicks)

19:18.458 --> 19:20.827
(indistinct conversations)

19:20.893 --> 19:22.195
SO HE'S NOT GAY?

19:22.262 --> 19:25.164
NO. BUT HE IS MARRIED.

19:25.232 --> 19:29.035
OKAY. SO... WE'RE LOOKING AT
A SISTER-WIFE SITUATION HERE.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.937
RIGHT.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.171
SO LOSE THE HAT.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.906
(amplified voice)
ANNOUNCEMENT, EVERYBODY.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.308
ANNOUNCEMENT.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.876
AS I'M SURE YOU HEARD BY NOW,

19:36.943 --> 19:41.548
CHATSWIN HIGH HAD ITS VERY OWN
UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS OFFICER

19:41.614 --> 19:44.584
SNOOPING AROUND THE SCHOOL
FOR ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.787
(chair scrapes floor)
LAXATIVES ARE NOT ILLEGAL.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.155
(students murmur)

19:49.222 --> 19:51.791
ANYWHO, I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO REMEMBER

19:51.858 --> 19:57.029
THAT IF SOMEONE OFFERS YOU DRUGS
OF ANY KIND, SAY NO.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.933
AND IF A STRANGER OFFERS
TO DRIVE YOU HOME FROM SCHOOL,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.702
SAY NO.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.773
AND IF THE CAFETERIA EVER SERVES
VEAL MEDALLIONS AGAIN,

20:06.839 --> 20:08.941
SAY NO.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.843
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.279
(murmuring)

20:14.781 --> 20:16.883
OH, AND ONE MORE ANNOUNCEMENT.
I'M GAY.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.218
(students gasp)
SO FROM THIS POINT ON,
I WILL BE DRIVING A MIATA.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.953
PLEASE LET ME KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.031
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THE ENCOURAGEMENT, TESSA.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.501
I CAN FINALLY BE OPEN
ABOUT MY PASSION

20:34.567 --> 20:38.905
FOR DEEP V-NECK T-SHIRTS
AND ANTI-AGING FACE CREAMS

20:38.971 --> 20:42.842
AND ICE SKATING IN AUGUST
AND STEPHEN SONDHEIM

20:42.909 --> 20:44.677
AND DIEUX DU STADE...

20:44.744 --> 20:48.381
SO JOSH WASN'T GAY, AND DONSKY
WAS GOING TO JUVIE,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.750
BUT AT LEAST SOMETHING GOOD
CAME OUT OF ALL THIS,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.985
AND THAT SOMETHING
WAS MR. WOLFE.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.287
..."CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF."
