WEBVTT

02:04.287 --> 02:06.205
That was impressive.

02:07.081 --> 02:08.666
I modified
the Frankish weapon.

02:08.749 --> 02:10.710
It has a much
greater range now.

02:10.793 --> 02:13.671
The Franks will not expect
to be attacked by
their own weapon.

02:25.808 --> 02:27.476
Bjorn must have
murdered our Berserker.

02:28.311 --> 02:29.437
It's a pity.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.105
It doesn't matter.

02:31.189 --> 02:33.191
Really?
How can you say so?

02:33.316 --> 02:35.193
Because we have eyes
in Ragnar's household.

02:36.027 --> 02:38.696
Anything we need to know,
we'll find out.

02:38.821 --> 02:40.865
Bjorn's weakness.
Ragnar's weakness.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.450
The time to strike.

02:42.533 --> 02:43.701
Through Torvi?

02:43.826 --> 02:44.994
Of course, through Torvi.

02:45.369 --> 02:46.704
Otherwise,
I'll kill her child.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.789
She knows
I'll do it, too.

02:56.047 --> 02:58.216
Lagertha must
never know what we did.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.222
Who would tell her, hmm?

03:08.184 --> 03:10.186
What were you
two talking about?

03:10.853 --> 03:13.898
Erlendur was telling me
how he has forgiven
Torvi for leaving him.

03:15.399 --> 03:16.651
Really?
Hmm.

03:20.404 --> 03:23.074
That young man
still surprises me sometimes.

03:24.408 --> 03:27.411
I, too, have a surprise.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.418
I am with child.

03:38.339 --> 03:40.091
That makes me so very happy.

03:40.216 --> 03:41.342
Me, too.

03:41.926 --> 03:43.594
More than I can say.

03:44.595 --> 03:46.514
Although it is
still early days.

03:48.432 --> 03:49.600
Marry me, Lagertha.

03:50.601 --> 03:54.063
Marry me. I have always
known that we were
fated to be together.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.775
Lagertha?

04:01.946 --> 04:04.073
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

04:05.283 --> 04:07.034
Don't ever be sorry.

04:07.118 --> 04:09.120
Say that you'll marry me.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.173
Who is he?

04:22.216 --> 04:23.509
You heard.

04:23.592 --> 04:25.344
He's a king.

04:25.428 --> 04:27.888
From Tamdrup,
wherever that is.

04:28.472 --> 04:30.224
And you trust him?

04:30.308 --> 04:31.392
No.

04:32.351 --> 04:34.312
I don't trust him either.

04:38.774 --> 04:41.193
Why do you not care
for your daughter, Siggy?

04:43.863 --> 04:45.489
I care for her.

04:46.324 --> 04:48.826
She just reminds me
of things I'd rather forget.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.663
What kind of man
takes a mother
away from her child?

04:56.542 --> 04:57.835
You tell me.

04:58.878 --> 05:01.005
You tried to take me
away from my mother.

05:02.757 --> 05:04.842
That is not the way it went.

05:05.634 --> 05:08.512
If you remember,
your mother left me.

05:11.015 --> 05:13.684
You left me.

05:21.817 --> 05:24.028
It is not easy
being a father.

05:24.362 --> 05:26.614
It is even harder
being a husband.

05:28.324 --> 05:30.326
Maybe I have
failed at both.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.288
No.

05:34.372 --> 05:36.248
I need a bit
more slack on the sail.

05:36.332 --> 05:38.918
I have
definitely failed
at being a husband.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.337
Need a hand?

05:41.420 --> 05:42.880
Take more than that.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.091
No, three will do.

05:47.593 --> 05:49.136
- Bring it here.
- Where do you think?

05:49.220 --> 05:51.305
I want that close to me.

05:51.389 --> 05:53.140
Why would we?

05:53.599 --> 05:54.809
Oil these oars!

05:56.310 --> 05:58.187
How many boats
and men do you have?

05:58.270 --> 06:00.022
More? No, take more.

06:00.106 --> 06:01.982
Take one more.
I will go get one.
Do you have enough?

06:02.066 --> 06:03.526
Twenty boats.

06:04.527 --> 06:06.112
About 600 men.

06:07.613 --> 06:10.866
I told Ragnar mine
is a small kingdom

06:11.951 --> 06:13.160
for now.

06:13.744 --> 06:14.870
Better for the night.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.832
And when will they arrive?

06:18.958 --> 06:21.252
They must already
be on their way.

06:22.586 --> 06:24.755
My brother,
Halfdan, is bringing them.

06:24.964 --> 06:26.257
Bring him on board.
Can you fill these?

06:26.340 --> 06:27.925
Is your brother like you?

06:28.676 --> 06:29.927
No.

06:31.262 --> 06:32.847
He's much worse.

06:35.558 --> 06:37.435
He's much worse!

06:38.769 --> 06:40.771
You have such ambitions.

06:41.522 --> 06:43.274
What else is there?

06:43.691 --> 06:48.320
What are we here
for except to achieve
fame, just like your father?

06:49.697 --> 06:53.409
Isn't that what
you want too, Bjorn Lothbrok?

06:53.492 --> 06:54.827
Be honest.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.454
You don't know me.

06:58.289 --> 07:02.626
And fame won't make
your small kingdom any bigger.

07:17.725 --> 07:18.767
Rider!

07:24.064 --> 07:25.399
How many are there?

07:28.944 --> 07:30.112
Open the gates!

07:35.451 --> 07:36.702
Werferth.

07:38.412 --> 07:41.916
We are met to decide
how to deal with Mercia.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.753
Now, I am almost decided
that the only way now

07:45.836 --> 07:49.256
is a full-scale
invasion of their kingdom.

07:49.340 --> 07:52.218
And, yet, if there
were some other way of

07:52.343 --> 07:55.179
restoring Queen
Kwenthrith to her throne,

07:55.304 --> 07:56.847
I think we must explore it.

07:56.972 --> 07:59.141
Have you any more
idea of the identity

07:59.266 --> 08:01.435
of the nobleman
you knew as "W"?

08:01.519 --> 08:03.187
Let me help you
please, Sire.

08:03.812 --> 08:05.856
The warring factions
of my kingdom

08:05.940 --> 08:09.527
are always known
by the first letter of
their leader's name.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.529
"W" stands for Wigstan.

08:11.946 --> 08:13.364
He has royal blood,

08:13.489 --> 08:16.784
as well as being one of
the most powerful
warlords in Mercia.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.661
Yet, he is obviously not
part of the Ruling Council.

08:19.036 --> 08:23.040
No. Wigstan would find it
unbearable to
belong to any group.

08:23.123 --> 08:25.459
His interests are
always personal.

08:25.793 --> 08:27.127
Then you don't trust him?

08:27.336 --> 08:28.629
Trust him?

08:28.712 --> 08:32.299
My Lord, no one
should ever trust Wigstan.

08:32.383 --> 08:34.885
So there is no
dealing with him?

08:35.010 --> 08:36.636
Absolutely not!

08:36.720 --> 08:39.640
The only way forward,
the only choice now,

08:39.722 --> 08:44.979
is for both of you noble kings
to raise your armies
and invade Mercia

08:45.062 --> 08:49.400
and rid my kingdom
of all the factions
who want to ruin me!

08:49.483 --> 08:50.651
Me!

08:50.734 --> 08:52.820
The only legitimate
ruler of that poor,

08:52.945 --> 08:55.072
ravaged,
raped and abused land.

08:56.907 --> 08:58.242
I agree with the Queen.

09:00.077 --> 09:02.329
There is no other choice now.

09:04.373 --> 09:05.416
Huh.

09:07.418 --> 09:08.502
So it seems.

09:09.503 --> 09:12.006
Very well.
We shall take your advice.

09:37.656 --> 09:38.782
Wife,

09:40.117 --> 09:41.535
come to bed.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.247
I said...

09:46.373 --> 09:47.416
No.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.880
Why not?

09:54.632 --> 09:56.300
I don't want to.

10:03.599 --> 10:05.976
Very well.

10:08.228 --> 10:11.482
Then go sleep with my father,

10:12.232 --> 10:13.651
you whore!

10:13.734 --> 10:15.653
Yes, yes, and why don't
you go

10:15.778 --> 10:17.696
and sleep with your mistress,
the Queen?

10:17.780 --> 10:20.574
Gives you another reason
to flagellate yourself!

10:21.700 --> 10:22.743
Go on. Hit me.

10:22.826 --> 10:25.537
Hit me if it
pleases you, husband.

10:25.621 --> 10:29.458
But it makes no difference,
either to you or me.

10:31.502 --> 10:37.091
You are husband
to me in name only,
as I am wife to you.

10:38.425 --> 10:41.720
But you're otherwise
free to do as you will.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.791
We had an argument.

11:10.874 --> 11:12.167
Aethelwulf?

11:12.251 --> 11:14.253
He called me your whore,

11:14.336 --> 11:18.257
which I am and have
freely chosen to be.

11:23.429 --> 11:25.305
Do you want me to leave?

11:40.821 --> 11:42.948
This was my wife's ring.

11:44.283 --> 11:46.493
My wife died in childbirth.

11:47.077 --> 11:49.997
I cannot tell
you the pain of it.

11:50.414 --> 11:54.376
And I was resolved
never to marry again.

11:55.377 --> 11:58.589
But I would
like you to wear it

12:03.135 --> 12:04.511
if you will.

12:18.442 --> 12:20.819
I cannot wait to take control
of my northern lands

12:20.944 --> 12:22.279
and set up my own court.

12:22.404 --> 12:24.948
You have some business
here first, remember?

12:25.324 --> 12:27.367
Some family business.

12:27.451 --> 12:28.660
I know.

12:28.785 --> 12:32.331
A man can dream, can he not,
of dancing naked on the sand?

12:32.456 --> 12:34.791
In any case,
my father needs you.

12:34.917 --> 12:38.420
He needs a strong man
to support him
and to guide him.

12:39.421 --> 12:41.006
He has Count Odo.

12:41.131 --> 12:42.674
I don't like Count Odo.

12:42.799 --> 12:44.343
Nor do I trust him.

12:44.968 --> 12:48.597
Of course, it's possible that
he could die in the fighting.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.766
Slain by some
unknown assailant.

12:50.849 --> 12:53.977
And then the Emperor
would just have to
rely more on you.

12:54.811 --> 12:56.813
Only a coward

12:58.315 --> 13:02.027
kills a man by
stabbing him in the back.

13:02.152 --> 13:03.820
That is what
a Viking would say.

13:03.904 --> 13:06.114
But you are no
longer a Viking.

13:06.198 --> 13:09.243
In Frankia, we do
certain things differently.

13:09.326 --> 13:12.204
That is something
you'll have to learn, my love.

13:12.663 --> 13:15.415
Something you'll certainly
have to learn.

13:38.855 --> 13:41.275
You asked
for a private audience.

13:44.611 --> 13:45.779
Why?

13:45.862 --> 13:47.739
Your Highness, forgive me,

13:47.823 --> 13:50.200
I am reluctant
to discuss matters

13:50.367 --> 13:52.744
which relate
directly to my superior.

13:52.828 --> 13:54.496
You mean Count Odo?

13:55.872 --> 13:58.041
Then absolve
yourself of any guilt

13:58.166 --> 14:00.377
and just say what
you have to say.

14:00.836 --> 14:04.965
Highness, I am troubled
that you always
trust his word.

14:05.757 --> 14:06.883
Why?

14:07.593 --> 14:10.387
Should...
Should I not trust his word?

14:10.971 --> 14:13.473
Because he is not
always worth believing.

14:14.141 --> 14:17.394
Why, pray,
is he not worth believing?

14:17.477 --> 14:19.563
Because he is ambitious.

14:19.646 --> 14:22.316
Ambitious beyond ambitious.

14:22.649 --> 14:24.860
So that even
an Emperor's crown

14:24.985 --> 14:27.195
would not sit
untidily upon his head.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.539
An Emperor's crown?

14:42.836 --> 14:44.087
I cannot believe it.

14:44.921 --> 14:46.882
What...
What are you saying?

14:47.341 --> 14:49.051
Do...
Do you have any proof of this?

14:49.134 --> 14:50.344
I have the word
of his mistress.

14:51.928 --> 14:53.472
And, as Your Highness knows,

14:53.555 --> 14:57.059
a man will always
divulge the truth
first to his mistress,

14:57.601 --> 15:01.480
and only afterwards,
if at all, to his wife.

15:02.481 --> 15:03.899
Very well.

15:05.150 --> 15:07.569
Let me talk to his mistress.

15:18.497 --> 15:19.998
For God's sake!

15:20.082 --> 15:22.417
How should I trust
the evidence of this woman?

15:23.877 --> 15:26.254
Because this
woman is my sister.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.303
Is it true?

15:35.138 --> 15:36.473
Yes, Your Highness.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.724
And?

15:37.808 --> 15:43.480
Does Count Odo talk
freely of his ambitions?

15:44.481 --> 15:45.982
Yes, he does.

15:46.566 --> 15:47.651
Very freely.

15:52.155 --> 15:55.659
His ambition to replace me?

15:58.954 --> 16:02.290
To become Emperor?

16:03.417 --> 16:05.335
Yes, exactly.

16:06.336 --> 16:10.298
His ambition to
become Emperor.

16:10.799 --> 16:11.967
Then...

16:12.801 --> 16:13.510
Then I beg you,

16:16.138 --> 16:19.850
please,
stay close, to Count Odo.

16:20.475 --> 16:24.938
Report to me
anything which might
signal his treachery.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.525
Now, go! Leave me!

16:45.667 --> 16:47.210
The forts have
been built according

16:47.335 --> 16:48.879
to your instructions,
Your Grace.

16:48.962 --> 16:50.213
Eventually,
there will be an iron chain

16:50.380 --> 16:51.631
which can be
raised between them

16:51.715 --> 16:53.550
to prevent the passage
of any boat upriver.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.719
We should still
place some boats
beyond this barrier,

16:55.802 --> 16:57.220
in case they break through.

16:57.345 --> 16:59.473
Hopefully,
they will be unable
to do so.

16:59.890 --> 17:01.975
You don't know my
people like I do.

17:02.058 --> 17:03.560
They don't
recognize any barriers,

17:03.685 --> 17:05.145
except as obstacles
to be overcome.

17:05.228 --> 17:08.315
What has become clear
to both the Emperor
and myself

17:08.397 --> 17:11.401
is that,
if we were to lose Paris,
we would lose everything.

17:11.526 --> 17:13.236
For then,
the enemy would command

17:13.361 --> 17:15.070
the Marne, the Seine
and the Yonne rivers,

17:15.196 --> 17:17.073
and the country would lie open
as far as Rheims.

17:17.199 --> 17:19.576
We must hold Paris
whatever the cost.

17:19.701 --> 17:23.246
There is no alternative.
No other choice.

17:23.371 --> 17:26.540
When my brother returns,
everything will
be decided here.

17:57.948 --> 17:59.866
Is this how you looked?

18:00.784 --> 18:01.910
Yes.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.456
Though my hair
was much shorter.

18:10.794 --> 18:13.463
What is the name
of your kingdom?

18:14.798 --> 18:15.966
China.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.426
And who rules it?

18:19.261 --> 18:23.056
The Emperor Dezong,
of the Tang Dynasty.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.396
I want to know
about your father.

18:30.605 --> 18:32.941
My father was a...
A merchant.
Oh.

18:33.441 --> 18:34.985
Well respected.

18:35.819 --> 18:38.154
Rich enough
to own a boat.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.573
What about the Emperor?

18:39.656 --> 18:41.241
Tell me about him.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.452
The Emperor had
many daughters...

18:44.661 --> 18:45.662
Hmm.

18:45.954 --> 18:48.456
...with his
wives and concubines.

18:49.583 --> 18:53.628
His concubines
were looked after
by the palace eunuchs.

18:54.671 --> 18:55.839
Eunuchs?

18:56.464 --> 18:58.300
Men who are not men.

18:59.676 --> 19:01.094
Why are they not men?

19:01.177 --> 19:03.179
Their manhood was cut off,

19:04.472 --> 19:08.602
so they could not have sex
with the Emperor's wives
or slaves.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.147
I don't like that.

19:12.355 --> 19:13.356
No.

19:13.523 --> 19:15.692
They didn't like it either.

19:43.178 --> 19:45.889
Are you one
of the Emperor's daughters?

19:56.149 --> 19:57.400
My father was a merchant.

19:57.525 --> 19:58.735
I know.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.737
You told me that before.

20:04.366 --> 20:05.533
I don't know you.

20:06.409 --> 20:08.078
And you don't know me.

20:08.203 --> 20:12.415
Yet I want to tell you
my most terrible secrets.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.292
Do you want to hear it?

20:14.417 --> 20:15.502
Yes.

20:15.585 --> 20:16.711
Mmm-hmm?

20:18.338 --> 20:20.340
I can share your burden.

20:20.757 --> 20:22.258
Mmm.

20:22.342 --> 20:25.929
I am small,
but I have broad shoulders

20:26.596 --> 20:28.556
and I am not afraid.

20:30.892 --> 20:34.270
I will tell you
when you tell me
the truth about your father.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.111
All right.

20:42.404 --> 20:44.781
Then give me more
of that medicine.

21:19.983 --> 21:23.319
Bjorn Ironside,
come and sit with me.

21:29.659 --> 21:31.536
We should talk
to one another.

21:34.664 --> 21:35.957
You don't trust me.

21:36.499 --> 21:38.460
I have no reason
to trust you.

21:38.835 --> 21:40.837
You have told me
of your ambitions.

21:41.796 --> 21:44.716
Whether my
ambitions come true or not,
it's not up to me.

21:45.550 --> 21:46.634
As well you know.

21:47.218 --> 21:49.179
'Cause I can make
sure they don't.

21:53.558 --> 21:56.102
I will never give you
any cause to kill me.

21:58.646 --> 22:00.064
That is not for you to say.

22:01.024 --> 22:03.026
I may find cause
where others may not.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.695
Who knows?

22:11.659 --> 22:15.538
But for now anyway,
we are allies.

22:17.373 --> 22:20.543
And we shall go
together to Paris.

22:21.211 --> 22:23.713
And we shall fight together.
Is it not so?

22:25.215 --> 22:29.177
You and Ragnar
need my warriors.
You need my ships.

22:31.221 --> 22:34.474
I can't wait for Paris,
Bjorn Ironside.

22:34.557 --> 22:35.892
I cannot wait.

22:36.017 --> 22:38.937
We shall destroy
those Christian folk!

22:39.062 --> 22:41.105
They have seen nothing yet.

22:41.231 --> 22:42.732
We are the masters now!

22:42.857 --> 22:44.484
- Is it not so?
- Yes! Yeah!

22:44.567 --> 22:45.652
Is it not so?

22:45.777 --> 22:46.861
Yes!

22:53.618 --> 22:57.372
So we are agreed,
we'll raise an army
and attack Mercia.

22:57.455 --> 22:59.165
There is no alternative,
my Lord Aelle.

22:59.249 --> 23:02.460
Not if we wish to see
Queen Kwenthrith placed
once more upon the throne.

23:04.462 --> 23:06.005
Travel safely, my Lord.

23:06.089 --> 23:08.716
You are the best of allies.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.385
I'm a simple man at heart,

23:10.468 --> 23:12.220
but full of conviction.

23:12.345 --> 23:14.055
Your
convictions do you credit.

23:16.057 --> 23:17.725
Farewell, my child.

23:20.395 --> 23:21.938
Take heed of
what I've told you.

23:22.939 --> 23:25.108
I will always
listen to you, Father.

23:25.233 --> 23:26.609
But also to
my own conscience,

23:26.734 --> 23:28.987
and weigh such
things in the balance,
as it please you.

23:29.112 --> 23:31.489
It does not always
please me.

23:31.614 --> 23:32.824
But enough.

23:32.949 --> 23:34.075
Women are frail.

23:35.118 --> 23:36.286
Farewell, children.

23:37.412 --> 23:40.707
Remember your duties,
say your prayers,

23:40.790 --> 23:42.375
and banish the Devil
from your thoughts.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.335
Such good advice,
my Lord Aelle.

23:45.128 --> 23:46.296
Farewell.

23:48.631 --> 23:50.008
King Ecbert?

23:50.133 --> 23:51.134
Front King's Guard!

23:51.259 --> 23:52.385
Yes, Queen Kwenthrith?

23:52.510 --> 23:53.636
All men forward!

23:54.178 --> 23:55.346
Move out!

23:55.471 --> 23:57.849
I need to know
that I can trust you.

23:57.974 --> 23:59.934
That you will do
what you promised me.

24:00.018 --> 24:01.853
Why would you doubt me?

24:02.645 --> 24:05.523
You've heard me speak
plainly and in public.

24:06.274 --> 24:08.610
I doubt you for
one reason only.

24:08.693 --> 24:12.488
And that is that you and I
are somewhat alike.

24:13.323 --> 24:16.284
Then do not judge
yourself too harshly.

24:39.682 --> 24:41.017
Lord,

24:44.646 --> 24:46.648
you know me for a sinner.

24:50.735 --> 24:52.695
My sins are

24:53.905 --> 24:57.200
carnal, venal,

24:59.035 --> 25:01.412
and unforgivable.
I know that.

25:04.874 --> 25:10.546
And I think you
have already decided to
cast me out into the darkness,

25:11.381 --> 25:13.091
like a fallen angel,

25:13.716 --> 25:18.096
to suffer in purgatory,
or the fires of hell,
for all eternity.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.227
Think you, Lord,

25:25.436 --> 25:28.731
that I can look upon such
scenes with equanimity?

25:30.108 --> 25:32.360
That I do not dream,
in the dead of night,

25:32.443 --> 25:35.029
of returning to your light
and the promises of heaven?

25:35.113 --> 25:37.532
Am I not a man
like other men?

25:44.414 --> 25:45.873
And yet,

25:47.250 --> 25:49.377
I would sup with the Devil

25:49.460 --> 25:52.964
if he would show me
how to achieve
my earthly goals.

25:53.089 --> 25:58.678
Your kingdom, Lord,
as you have said,
is not of this world,

25:58.761 --> 26:01.097
but my kingdom is.

26:07.603 --> 26:09.564
And therefore,

26:10.565 --> 26:13.109
there is no help for me.

26:15.111 --> 26:18.156
No other way for me

26:21.117 --> 26:23.786
but eternal damnation.

27:09.832 --> 27:11.667
A boat's come in!
They're here!

27:14.504 --> 27:17.632
Bring him in!
Over here!

27:26.641 --> 27:28.184
Brother.
Brother!

27:31.187 --> 27:32.396
This is Kattegat!

27:32.522 --> 27:34.649
This is Kattegat.

27:36.859 --> 27:37.902
Come.

27:46.494 --> 27:47.537
King Ragnar,

27:49.872 --> 27:52.208
this is my brother Halfdan.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.753
Meet the notorious
King Ragnar.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.550
It's a great honor.

28:03.344 --> 28:04.846
When do we sail for Paris?

28:05.930 --> 28:07.390
You seem eager to fight.

28:07.515 --> 28:09.058
Yes, it's true.

28:09.934 --> 28:12.603
Not just for
the sake of fighting,
but for the beauty of it.

28:18.526 --> 28:20.152
And against the Christians,
yes.

28:20.236 --> 28:21.612
I hate the Christians.

28:22.113 --> 28:23.906
In the name of Odin,
I would kill them all.

28:25.366 --> 28:28.369
You'll have the opportunity
to kill a great number of them

28:30.454 --> 28:32.039
once we reach Paris.

28:50.433 --> 28:51.976
Faster!

28:52.435 --> 28:54.186
Argh!

29:26.302 --> 29:28.763
They'll be
wondering where you are.

29:30.514 --> 29:31.933
I doubt it.

29:56.666 --> 29:58.459
What are
you thinking about?

29:58.542 --> 29:59.794
Paris.

30:01.629 --> 30:04.757
You must be
excited to be going back.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.092
No.

30:10.513 --> 30:12.014
I feel so old.

30:16.268 --> 30:18.896
When I was young,
I had the passion to win,

30:19.021 --> 30:23.734
but now, with age
and all that comes with it,

30:25.361 --> 30:27.279
I have lost the desire.

30:29.115 --> 30:30.783
And the strength.

30:42.503 --> 30:44.714
A few years ago,
I established a settlement

30:44.797 --> 30:48.843
in a distant country
where I took many of
my people and friends

30:48.926 --> 30:51.387
to make a new
life for themselves.

30:55.224 --> 30:57.893
But shortly
after my departure,
they were all slaughtered.

30:57.977 --> 31:00.229
Their homes
destroyed and burned.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.568
I live with such
guilt because of it.

31:13.409 --> 31:15.077
And nobody knows.

31:32.511 --> 31:34.555
My father's the Emperor.

32:01.082 --> 32:05.294
They say he left Kattegat
a boy and came back a man.

32:06.462 --> 32:08.255
Killed a bear
with his bare hands.

32:09.131 --> 32:10.800
With his own hands?
Hmm.

32:27.942 --> 32:29.360
Who is that?

32:29.902 --> 32:32.154
It is Floki,
the boat builder.

32:32.446 --> 32:34.281
For some reason
no one will tell me,

32:34.406 --> 32:36.242
he has fallen out
with King Ragnar.

32:36.992 --> 32:38.244
Ask him.

32:39.245 --> 32:41.455
Floki. Boat builder.

32:41.539 --> 32:42.957
Sit down with us.

32:43.499 --> 32:45.751
Yes, Floki.
Sit down. Make room.

32:51.841 --> 32:53.092
Both of you join us.

32:53.175 --> 32:54.635
Fill the horns.
Sup.

32:54.718 --> 32:57.221
This is my younger brother,
Halfdan.

32:58.514 --> 32:59.598
He's keen to know you.

32:59.723 --> 33:00.808
All right.

33:04.728 --> 33:06.480
So, you are the genius
that built

33:06.605 --> 33:08.357
the boats that
changed our world,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.943
and helped make
Ragnar so famous!

33:11.026 --> 33:13.320
Why would he fall out
with someone like you?

33:13.904 --> 33:15.739
Because I killed
his pet Christian.

33:15.823 --> 33:16.866
Floki!

33:18.868 --> 33:19.994
Skol.

33:21.370 --> 33:22.538
To new friendships.

33:22.997 --> 33:24.206
Skol!

33:24.790 --> 33:25.833
Skol!

33:26.208 --> 33:27.251
Skol.

38:23.505 --> 38:25.215
My turn!
Here, catch it!

38:25.966 --> 38:27.050
Mine!

38:40.981 --> 38:42.941
Ivar, do you want to play?

38:49.406 --> 38:50.490
Got it!

38:53.118 --> 38:54.912
It's mine, give it back!

38:56.246 --> 38:57.623
Now you go!

38:59.124 --> 39:00.500
Here! To me!

39:04.671 --> 39:05.714
Throw it!

39:06.965 --> 39:08.008
Here!

39:08.508 --> 39:09.885
Give it here!

39:13.513 --> 39:15.432
- Not to him.
- No, you...

39:15.515 --> 39:16.558
Higher!

39:18.518 --> 39:20.103
My turn!

39:20.187 --> 39:21.230
To me!

39:27.778 --> 39:29.363
Come on! Here!

39:56.390 --> 39:57.641
Do not be afraid.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.893
It's not your fault.

39:59.977 --> 40:01.853
Everything is all right.

40:05.023 --> 40:07.234
Everything will be all right.

40:56.575 --> 40:57.909
What is that?

41:00.620 --> 41:01.955
Can I see?

41:05.917 --> 41:07.210
Where did you find this?

41:07.294 --> 41:09.004
I took it from someone.

41:09.629 --> 41:10.797
Why are you so interested?

41:13.842 --> 41:15.343
I want to talk to you.

41:15.761 --> 41:17.137
What about?

41:18.513 --> 41:19.598
Us.

41:20.974 --> 41:23.518
We have moments
when I feel so close to you,

41:23.643 --> 41:24.978
especially when
you're inside me,

41:25.103 --> 41:26.438
but then you
don't want to talk,

41:26.521 --> 41:28.231
and I wonder why
you really came for me

41:28.356 --> 41:30.025
and took me
away from my child.

41:37.532 --> 41:38.658
Torvi.

41:44.456 --> 41:45.999
I talk to you.

42:03.183 --> 42:04.559
By the way,

42:05.519 --> 42:06.895
that was Erlendur's ring.

42:11.066 --> 42:13.693
He got it from his father,
King Horik.

42:55.360 --> 42:59.114
You look... Lagertha,
you look so beautiful.

43:03.076 --> 43:05.745
This is always how I imagined
this moment.

43:06.913 --> 43:08.540
Wherever I am,

43:08.623 --> 43:12.544
I don't ever want to forget
how you looked on
our wedding day.

44:36.544 --> 44:38.213
Earl Kalf is dead.

44:38.296 --> 44:40.298
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:41.216 --> 44:43.301
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:43.385 --> 44:46.137
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:46.221 --> 44:48.390
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:48.515 --> 44:51.226
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:51.309 --> 44:55.313
Long live Earl Ingstad!
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:55.647 --> 44:57.816
Long live Earl Ingstad!

44:57.899 --> 45:00.235
Long live Earl Ingstad!

45:00.318 --> 45:02.821
Long live Earl Ingstad!

45:02.904 --> 45:05.240
Long live Earl Ingstad!

45:05.323 --> 45:07.909
Long live Earl Ingstad!
