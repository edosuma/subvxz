Announcer:
You're watching the simpsons.

00:02.670 --> 00:05.604
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.039
Catch all-new episodes sundays,

00:07.041 --> 00:09.475
And check out our other fox
programs, brooklyn nine-nine,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.610
Bob's burgers <i>and</i> family guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Only on fox.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.157
Homer:
Come on, marge, where's dinner?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.525
What's the holdup
in there?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.028
(to "charge" fanfare):
♪ pot-pop-pot-pot pot pies!

00:29.030 --> 00:30.362
A pie for bart...

00:30.364 --> 00:31.797
Come on,
put them down already.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.065
...A veggie pie
for lisa...

00:33.067 --> 00:34.800
Why do you have
to describe everything?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.201
...A baby pie for maggie.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.970
The pies know
who they're for.

00:37.972 --> 00:39.805
A dog pie for
santa's little helper.
What? The dog...

00:39.807 --> 00:41.073
The dog before me?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.075
Now, be sure to
cut it open first

00:43.077 --> 00:44.977
So the pie has time to cool.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.412
(screams) I'm done.

00:46.414 --> 00:49.415
I know you're in a hurry to go
to the bar to watch football,

00:49.417 --> 00:52.151
But first I want you
to put the kids to bed.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.185
(groans loudly)

00:53.187 --> 00:54.553
(strains, grunts)

00:54.555 --> 00:57.389
"everything after the tornado
was a dream. The end."

00:59.159 --> 01:00.325
(tires screech)

01:00.327 --> 01:01.693
Announcer:
Going into halftime,

01:01.695 --> 01:04.530
It's springfield atoms 7,
boston americans 10.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.399
Oh, come on,
we cannot lose again

01:07.401 --> 01:10.235
To those no-good
boston cheaters!

01:10.237 --> 01:12.671
I-I can't stand that
pretty-boy quarterback.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.339
Thinks he's so handsome,

01:14.341 --> 01:16.408
Just 'cause he's
drop-dead gorgeous.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.044
The only boston wins
is because they cheat!

01:19.046 --> 01:21.080
Listening in
on our teams' headsets,

01:21.082 --> 01:22.247
Fattening our cheerleaders.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.916
You know,
for three games last year,

01:23.918 --> 01:26.051
Boston used a volleyball
painted brown.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.020
(boston accent):
That was never proven,

01:28.022 --> 01:30.222
You springfield screw-job.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.790
Ugh, boston fans.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.626
In town for the
dennis lehane book tour.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.896
Go kiss a kennedy, you rule-
breaking cranberry squeezers!

01:37.898 --> 01:39.231
We don't cheat.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.200
We won 12 division
titles in ten years,

01:41.202 --> 01:42.701
Fair and square.

01:42.703 --> 01:46.438
You dorks are just jealous
of all our championship rings.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.141
All:
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

01:49.143 --> 01:50.542
You're the one
who's jealous.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.112
I only wish I could be
as jealous as you.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.613
Geez, jay, this place has got

01:54.615 --> 01:56.281
More knobs
than a hardware store.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.417
I hate this town.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.586
So don't I.
Friggin' doorknobs.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.387
(laughter)
automatic.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.156
Both:
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.291
Announcer:
It's fourth and long,

02:06.293 --> 02:07.626
The americans' last chance

02:07.628 --> 02:08.760
For a miracle.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.929
Come on, springfield,
put it away!

02:10.931 --> 02:13.132
We're gonna win one.
We're finally gonna win one!

02:13.134 --> 02:15.134
Announcer: The qb handsomely
takes the snap,

02:15.136 --> 02:16.635
Sexily steps back to pass,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.904
And with god-given good looks,
fires it downfield!

02:18.906 --> 02:20.472
But there's no one there
to receive it!

02:20.474 --> 02:21.406
(groaning)

02:21.408 --> 02:23.175
(scoffs)
nice pass.

02:23.177 --> 02:26.245
What a first-ballot
hall-of-fame loser.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.280
Announcer: But the ball is
caught by the americans' mascot,

02:28.282 --> 02:29.748
Flappy the flag!

02:29.750 --> 02:31.517
Flappy running unopposed
into the end zone

02:31.519 --> 02:34.253
For a surely illegal touchdown.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.155
Throwing to the mascot?

02:36.157 --> 02:39.958
After further review,
flappy the flag is listed

02:39.960 --> 02:43.795
On the americans' 53-man roster
and reported eligible.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.597
The result of the play
is a touchdown.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.665
(crowd cheering)

02:46.667 --> 02:47.866
Announcer:
Once again, the americans

02:47.868 --> 02:49.101
Found a way to win.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.802
(chuckles)
oh, that'll put a smile

02:50.804 --> 02:52.104
On coach bonderchuck's face.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.806
(crowd cheering)

02:54.808 --> 02:56.808
(cheering)
oh, not again!

02:56.810 --> 02:59.211
They cheated! You cheated!

02:59.213 --> 03:01.547
Did not. You got to
cover the mascot.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.382
Use your noggin. Play smart.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.150
Flappy's on the roster.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.019
(chanting):
On the roster!

03:07.021 --> 03:10.522
On the roster!
On the roster!

03:10.524 --> 03:12.391
On the roster, my butt.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.693
Once again,
those boston cheaters

03:14.695 --> 03:16.695
Think the rules
don't apply to them.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.997
And they're so smug
about winning.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.700
If I ever won anything,
I wouldn't be smug about it.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.869
I'd be class
all the way,

03:23.871 --> 03:27.072
Like mark harmon--
pure american elegance.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.008
I tell ya, the next
boston fan I see,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.343
I'm just gonna lose it.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.045
Lose it so hard.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.413
And... What the...

03:35.648 --> 03:37.182
What is... How could...

03:37.184 --> 03:39.985
That hat! Your head!

03:39.987 --> 03:41.153
That team.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.055
My son!

03:43.057 --> 03:45.023
Hey, dad, caught
the game last night.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.391
Tough loss
for your guys.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.060
Guess we just
wanted it more.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.195
(sarcastically):
Oh, am I in the right house?

03:50.197 --> 03:51.897
Because no one
in my house

03:51.899 --> 03:56.668
Would ever be caught <i>dead</i>
<i>wearing boston americans gear.</i>

03:56.670 --> 03:58.237
Dead!

03:58.239 --> 03:59.504
I feel ya, homer.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.006
Sucks to be a loser.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.375
Unlike the six-time
mega-bowl champion

04:03.377 --> 04:04.876
Boston americans.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.411
Mwah! (smooches)

04:06.413 --> 04:07.946
Ring, ring, ring.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.181
(frustrated grunts)

04:09.183 --> 04:10.415
Give me that hat.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.285
(growls)

04:13.287 --> 04:15.254
(grunting, snorting)

04:16.256 --> 04:18.123
Olé!

04:19.225 --> 04:22.461
(sighs) your father never
could resist an "olé."

04:22.463 --> 04:24.229
Eh, he'll run out
of steam soon.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.999
(homer groaning)

04:28.234 --> 04:31.036
(laughter)

04:31.038 --> 04:32.271
Get in.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.139
(milhouse and nelson scream)

04:34.141 --> 04:35.307
(gulps)

04:35.309 --> 04:37.075
Look around, son.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.744
This is your hometown.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.880
And the springfield atoms
are your hometown team--

04:41.882 --> 04:44.116
Since 2003, when we stole them

04:44.118 --> 04:46.218
In the middle of the night
from portland.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.253
What kind of life
can you have here

04:48.255 --> 04:49.988
As a boston fan?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.123
See?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.458
Why are you wearing
that boston hat?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.427
This is
atoms country, bro!

04:55.429 --> 04:59.431
I would pluck out my own eyes
if I did not have a call-back

04:59.433 --> 05:02.701
For a web-only
olive garden commercial.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.439
They're just trying
to hat shame me.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.742
Face it, dad, boston is
the bart simpson of cities.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.744
All those awesome southies
in   <i>the departed,</i>

05:12.746 --> 05:14.479
(chuckles)
those are my people.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.983
People? The dog and the
baby are your people.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.119
(sighs) it all goes back
to the boston tea party,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.822
A prank so kick-ass
it started a country.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.023
(tires screech)

05:25.025 --> 05:26.958
Come on, pal, what do you say?

05:26.960 --> 05:30.329
Just lose the hat,
for your old man.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.566
Nope, I think I'll stick
with the bad boys.

05:36.803 --> 05:40.005
Get it off before god sees.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.941
(whimpering)

05:42.943 --> 05:44.176
(groans):
Oh!

05:47.547 --> 05:50.449
And the people from boston
are so obnoxious.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.452
They think their stupid city
has the best everything:

05:53.454 --> 05:55.854
Bands, comedians, chowder,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.724
Their so-called cream pies,
which are actually cakes.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.325
And there's...
Why don't you let me

06:00.327 --> 06:02.961
Take your mind off
your problems?

06:02.963 --> 06:04.629
And what's
with aerosmith?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.365
That's not how
you spell "arrow."

06:06.367 --> 06:07.666
The... Oh.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.369
(both moaning)

06:10.371 --> 06:11.603
(confused grunting)

06:14.340 --> 06:15.707
(whimpering)

06:20.012 --> 06:21.346
Do your job, homer.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.215
(homer screams)

06:24.417 --> 06:25.684
Bart, you're my son.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.586
There's no neck
tattoo so crass,

06:27.588 --> 06:30.155
No gender reassignment
too ambiguous

06:30.157 --> 06:31.590
That I would not love you.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.659
Which is why I must show you
the error of your ways,

06:34.661 --> 06:38.930
Even if it means dragging
this family all the way to hell.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.601
A vacation to boston?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.936
No, not a <i>vay-cation,</i>

06:44.938 --> 06:46.538
A <i>hate-cation!</i>

06:46.540 --> 06:49.541
Where you experience
the worst a place has to offer,

06:49.543 --> 06:51.710
And then say, "told ya!"

06:51.712 --> 06:55.247
Hate-watching, hate-voting
and now a hate-cation?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.016
Why can't everyone just
enjoy things they like?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.051
Because things you like
don't fill you

07:00.053 --> 07:02.921
With delicious,
delicious rage.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.256
Hmm, I'm gonna
love this trip.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.191
I'm gonna love it
right in your face.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.060
That's it,
build it up in your head.

07:09.062 --> 07:12.030
High hopes just make
the hate-cation stronger.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.031
You're crazy.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.033
Boston can't
be that bad.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.905
(horns honking)

07:19.907 --> 07:23.108
I've never loved
hating anything so much!

07:23.110 --> 07:25.076
Move your
garbage car!

07:25.078 --> 07:28.180
I got to get to the packy
before the b's drop puck!

07:29.148 --> 07:30.282
Told ya!

07:37.790 --> 07:41.293
See, boy? Notice how bostonians
aren't exactly ugly,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.628
But they're not
sexy either.

07:43.630 --> 07:47.132
Homer, your negative attitude
is ruining this hate-cation.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.167
So, what to hate first?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.235
The freedom trail?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.170
The touch tank
at the new England aquarium?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.605
Ooh, that could blow.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.173
I want to go to southie.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.610
That part of town has the
towniest townies of any town.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.979
(scoffs) you think your
bostonians are so great?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.348
Watch as your
beloved hooligans

08:03.350 --> 08:05.951
Tear your innocent father
limb from limb

08:05.953 --> 08:08.653
With just
the slightest provocation.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.358
Listen up, you clam-gargling
tea-tossers!

08:13.360 --> 08:16.595
Fenway is a terrible ballpark!

08:16.597 --> 08:18.096
Dad, don't!

08:18.098 --> 08:20.031
Out of my way, ladies.
You're blocking my shot.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.034
The seats at fenway park
are too narrow,

08:23.036 --> 08:26.171
And many of them
face center field!

08:26.173 --> 08:30.509
It's not charming,
it's a teardown!

08:30.511 --> 08:31.710
(boston accent):
The bobbleheads!

08:31.712 --> 08:32.944
They're tippin'!

08:32.946 --> 08:34.613
(boston accent):
Kid, mind the cart!

08:34.615 --> 08:36.014
The what?
The cart!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.983
The cot?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.217
Cot!

08:39.219 --> 08:43.054
(grunting)

08:43.056 --> 08:44.189
No, don't struggle!

08:44.191 --> 08:46.057
It only makes them
bobble harder.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.159
They keep coming.
Bobblehead steven wright,

08:48.161 --> 08:51.997
Bobblehead aimee mann,
bobblehead bell biv devoe!

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
The vibrations are killing him!

08:54.001 --> 08:55.200
Don't worry, sweetheart,

08:55.202 --> 08:56.668
I'm a doctor.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.470
I'm also a doctor, kid.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.672
(groaning)

09:00.674 --> 09:02.974
Mm, so many doctors.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.477
He's got a pedro
lodged in his airway.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.745

09:06.747 --> 09:08.179
He'll be fine, ma'am.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.049
And because of our state's
super-socialized health care,

09:11.051 --> 09:14.219
No matter how much your husband
abuses his body,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.254
Someone else will pay for it.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.924
What a relief for women
with hot-tempered,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.892
Accident-prone husbands.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.928
Oh, yeah, we got
a whole surgical center

09:22.930 --> 09:25.931
For injuries from falling off
icy roofs and gutters.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.599
Both:
Ooh.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.371
While the doctors pull tiny
bruins helmets out of your skin,

09:33.373 --> 09:36.274
Lisa and I are going to
explore the hub on our own.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.577
Remember, this is
a hate-cation.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.078
You better go
someplace bad.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.614
Isn't mayor quimby from
somewhere around here?

09:44.216 --> 09:47.285
(all muttering
with thick accents)

09:49.956 --> 09:52.090
People are so fit here.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.193
Everyone looks like they're
in a financial services ad.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.697
Free sunscreen?
So progressive.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.732
Do you vaccinate
your children?

10:00.734 --> 10:01.866
Of course.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.736
But not <i>stupid</i>
<i>progressive.</i>

10:04.738 --> 10:07.639

10:07.641 --> 10:10.575
(gasps)
it's-it's nerds!

10:10.577 --> 10:14.546
They've got every
recognized species of nerd!

10:14.548 --> 10:15.947
A jester-hatted

10:15.949 --> 10:17.749
A wild west-afarian!

10:17.751 --> 10:19.584
A  <i>magic: The gathering</i>
<i>gathering!</i>

10:20.887 --> 10:23.121

Yo-yo girls!

10:23.123 --> 10:25.423
A chain mail ping pong player.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.725

10:26.727 --> 10:28.627
So much education.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.662
If they did
a  <i>real housewives</i>here,

10:30.664 --> 10:32.764
It would be a total snooze.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.899
Ah, it's like
heaven for people

10:34.901 --> 10:36.968
Who don't believe
in heaven.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.137
Homer:
<i>What the crap is this bs?</i>

10:39.139 --> 10:42.073
What? I thought you'd want
to try candlepin bowling.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.845
Hey, mccarthy,
nice half-worcester.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.680
Get bent, mcdonald.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.649
A lot of wood
to work with out there.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.150
(sputters)
boston.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.452
They even found a way
to mess up bowling.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.654
Just try it.

10:55.656 --> 10:56.855
(groans)

10:56.857 --> 10:58.556
Eh, all right.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.027
(grunts)

11:03.129 --> 11:06.097
None of the usual pain
in my knees, back,

11:06.099 --> 11:08.366
Wrist, shoulder,
neck, and chest.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.504
(grunts)

11:14.140 --> 11:16.341
(groans)
one pin standing.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.842
Story of my life.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.344
Whoa there, pal.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.379
Don't forget
your third ball.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.647
Hold on, wait.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.182
Wait. Hold on.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.250
Wait.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.519
What?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.654
This is candlepin bowling.

11:29.656 --> 11:30.955
You get three.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.224
Hmm? Hmm.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.726
(grunts)

11:40.232 --> 11:42.167
(gasps)
three balls.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.036
I see it all so clearly now.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.905
What, dad? What is it?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.708
This regional bowling
with its one extra roll

11:49.710 --> 11:53.511
Has knocked my misguided hate
into the gutter.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.512
Mwah!

11:54.514 --> 11:57.182
I like boston!

11:57.184 --> 11:59.984
Dad, you and me are real

That values education,
with great health care,

12:47.534 --> 12:49.234
And everyone's outdoorsy

you, of all people...

13:01.148 --> 13:04.249
Honey, this could be the chance
we never thought we'd get.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.986
The chance to knock down
all of life's pins.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.989
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

13:10.991 --> 13:15.660
I am. Fate is offering us
a third ball.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.329
Do you mean it?
Are we going to move to boston?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.933

14:17.656 --> 14:20.391

Don't worry, baby.

straight to running numbers

19:26.199 --> 19:29.333
(struggling):
Just... A... Hat.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.668
You can do it, homie.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.136
Think of the candlepins.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.672
This is our extra ball!

19:34.674 --> 19:38.176
A... Better... Life.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.477
(yells)

19:39.479 --> 19:41.679
(all gasping)

19:43.882 --> 19:45.483
(quacking)

19:45.485 --> 19:47.051
Derrr!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.120
Stupid cheaters!

19:49.122 --> 19:50.221
You cheat,

19:50.223 --> 19:52.356
You flip out when people
say you cheat,

19:52.358 --> 19:53.558
And everybody knows

19:53.560 --> 19:56.127
You're nothing but a big bunch
of cheaters!

19:56.129 --> 19:59.130
(chuckling)

19:59.132 --> 20:00.898
You made us leave
that lovely city

20:00.900 --> 20:03.067
Rather than just
put on a stupid hat.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.535
It wasn't even fitted.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.238
(sighs)
I just couldn't wear the hat.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.006
Well, I'm still mad at you.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.976
I never even got to experience
one of those boston winters

20:11.978 --> 20:13.477
Everyone raves about.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.047
Come on, baby, we could
never escape our problems

20:16.049 --> 20:17.748
By moving somewhere else.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.052
Our problems are <i>who</i> we
are, not where we are.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.987
Well... Maybe.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.089
The traffic was
pretty annoying.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.491
Not to mention
the unspoken racism.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.161
It wasn't that unspoken.

20:31.263 --> 20:32.897
At least someone
in this family

20:32.899 --> 20:34.765
Is happy about
where they came from.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.069
Oh, don't worry, lisa.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.037
You'll get back
to boston someday.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.906
What are you
talking about?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.207
I never left.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.509
I'm in boston now.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.013
Welcome home, lisa.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.681
Class is about to start.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.650
(classical music playing)

20:53.619 --> 20:54.685
Eh.
