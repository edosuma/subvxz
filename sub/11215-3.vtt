WEBVTT

00:31.732 --> 00:34.368
Previously on Southland:
I can smell the
booze on you.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.803
From two days ago!

00:35.836 --> 00:39.073
Turn him in.
You do it or I'll do it.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.542
You know I have
your back, partner.
Yeah.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.845
Wait a minute, who are you?
I'm Rene Cordero,
your new partner.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.148
You said I could work alone
until Russ gets back.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.816
We're not sure Russ
is coming back.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.120
Dewey, stop. You're being
like a fucking kid!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.088
(engine revving)

00:54.122 --> 00:55.523
(tires squealing)
Dewey!

01:03.197 --> 01:06.634
(siren wailing)

01:11.139 --> 01:12.773
(panting)

01:30.224 --> 01:32.726
MAN:
Sooner or later,
every police officer

01:32.760 --> 01:36.164
will learn you can't
save everyone.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.467
(keypad beeping)

01:42.770 --> 01:43.804
(gasps)

01:43.837 --> 01:46.374
I think everything
is fine, okay?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.808
I just thought
I heard something

01:47.841 --> 01:49.243
and I need to be sure.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.511
(clattering, crashing
in distance)

01:52.313 --> 01:55.183
Okay, I want you to
get into the tub.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.518
Use this only
if you have to.
(whimpering)

01:57.551 --> 01:58.519
Take it.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.870
(footsteps in distance,
approaching)

02:29.783 --> 02:32.253
(gasping)

03:02.983 --> 03:06.487
Be on the lookout
for a homeless man
with active TB.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.888
He's carrying
an orange blanket.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.990
Most of you know him
as Homeless Joe.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.992
If you see him,
don't approach.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.394
Call the Health
Department.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.895
They'll come
and contain him.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.699
Okay, Cooper and Sherman
are working in A43.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.535
Garcia and Montoya
are in A91.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.671
Becker's on the front desk.
Park, you're in U-2.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.938
Brown, you're assigned
to the kit room.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.308
I'm not on light duty.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.009
You got a problem with it,
see me after the roll call.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.912
Animal Control is doing
roundups today.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.814
If they ask for
backup, do it.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.992
What are you putting me
in the kit room for?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.898
It's for your own good.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.433
You're not safe
out there.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.002
For now, you're in
the kit room.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.543
You told me
to turn in Dewey.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.746
I do the right thing and
now I'm the bad guy?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.415
This is such bullshit.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.782
Go get the gear.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.387
Dewey gets a paid vacation
in Palm Springs

04:13.421 --> 04:16.056
like he's some kind of celebrity
and I get stuck in the kit room?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.992
You told me
to do it, John.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.894
You made me do it.
Okay.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.841
I already have the keys.

04:33.874 --> 04:34.942
I'm taking it.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.510
You're in a U-boat
by yourself.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.778
You got your
book signed.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.513
You can ride alone.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.881
It's your first time
without a partner,

04:40.914 --> 04:41.882
so pay attention.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.016
Yeah, okay.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.718
You be safe out there.
Yeah.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.919
Smart.
Mm-hmm.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.688
Remember your training.
Yeah.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.757
Hands-- watch the hands.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.992
Okay, Dad.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.897
Hey.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.065
Thanks.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.435
Don't thank me yet.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.553
It's not even funny!

05:19.587 --> 05:22.756
LYDIA:
Niecy James, please.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.925
Hey, Niecy, you called me?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.628
Whoa! Hey, okay!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.029
Look, I'm sorry.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.098
I just-- I've been
busy, all right?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.734
I promise, I'm gonna
get by there today.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.969
Come on. Wait a minute.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.138
Of course I care about her,
all right?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.973
I've just been busy.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.910
People are still killing each
other out there, all right?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.112
Okay, bye.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.916
I never heard you apologize
to no one.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.519
You don't know
me that well.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.021
What are you
sorry about?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.790
It's this case
from a while back.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.960
We found this baby, Jimmy,
crawling across the street

05:59.993 --> 06:01.429
by himself.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.030
His dad put him
in a box

06:03.063 --> 06:04.932
and left him in front
of a power station.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.635
He thought it was okay
to just drop him off there.
No way.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.903
Yeah.
But the mom, Brianna,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.805
she's really
a sweet kid,

06:11.839 --> 06:14.842
so I told Family Services
that I would become
part of her team.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.011
You know, help her make
decisions, things like that.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.747
Anyway, she's up for review

06:19.780 --> 06:21.849
and I've got to get
by there and make sure

06:21.882 --> 06:24.452
she's set up right and doing all
the right things for Jimmy.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.986
You want a ride?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.055
Yeah, I mean,
can we do this?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.057
There aren't any dead bodies
since last night,

06:30.090 --> 06:31.459
so we have a window.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.460
Okay, let's go.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.927
Give me a minute.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.966
Yeah, Russell Clarke's room.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.602
(phone ringing)

06:43.937 --> 06:46.574
Can you tell him that
his partner called?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.842
All right, thanks.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.082
Hey, Jerry, you listen to music?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.884
I'm on to you.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.961
I mean it, Coop--
thanks for riding with me.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.965
You know how
much this sucks?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.967
Everyone's mad at me;
thinks I'm a rat.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.135
Oh, come on, stop, okay?

07:15.168 --> 07:17.104
It's not fucken Serpico.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.607
It's not why no one
wants to ride with you.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.108
Of course that's why.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.976
No, it's not, okay?
It's not, all right?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.712
You're a crap cop,
okay, Chickie?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.014
You used to be a good one,
but you're not anymore.

07:27.047 --> 07:31.018
You know, say what you
want about Dewey,

07:31.051 --> 07:34.121
but, man, he would, he would
charge right in there,

07:34.154 --> 07:35.889
right in there!

07:35.923 --> 07:38.091
You, you have been hiding
behind him for years.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.860
You should have drug
his ass into rehab

07:39.893 --> 07:41.529
a long time ago,
but you didn't.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.798
Now I don't know what the hell
happened to you,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.967
but you are nothing
like the girl that I met.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.015
Hey!

08:04.752 --> 08:05.986
Hey.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.689
Hey! Hey!

08:08.722 --> 08:10.023
Whoa. Cut it.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.291
(lawnmower engine shuts off)

08:11.324 --> 08:12.793
You all right?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.027
Yeah.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.663
I'm fine.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.198
Parents home?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.934
Just my dad.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.810
(dog barking)

08:36.283 --> 08:38.218
What do you want?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.957
Sir, can you explain why
your kid is dressed like that?

08:43.991 --> 08:46.727
None of your fucking business.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.029
Seems kind of upset.
Yeah.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.330
Well, he should
have thought about that

08:50.363 --> 08:51.865
before he let
those assholes

08:51.899 --> 08:53.601
take a brand-new,
$100 pair of sneakers

08:53.634 --> 08:55.102
off his skinny ass.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.171
Act like a pussy,
dress like a pussy.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.314
How long you going
to make him do this?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.849
Long as I feel
like it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
You got a problem
with it?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.019
Yeah, I do.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.958
So, arrest me, you little punk.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.662
You think humiliating him
is the answer?

09:21.695 --> 09:23.130
Look, Junior G-man,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.298
why don't you just
get the hell out of here.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.800
This is private property.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.006
You're a total dick,
you know that?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.114
He touches you,
call me.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.989
Cut the grass.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.904
Yeah, but I changed the locks.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.305
So, how do you think
he got in?

10:05.338 --> 10:06.940
I don't know.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.809
That's why I'm
freaking out so much.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.844
I... um, I was out

10:10.878 --> 10:13.213
for a couple of hours
for a job interview,

10:13.246 --> 10:16.850
and when I got back,
my shower's on,

10:16.884 --> 10:18.986
and there's towels
all over the floor.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.088
(sighs)

10:21.121 --> 10:23.023
And...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.029
(sighs)

10:29.062 --> 10:30.998
And this.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.267
He pissed on it.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.803
Wow.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.905
Right?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.339
I'm terrified of him.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.909
He's totally obsessed with me.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.711
How long did
you guys go out?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.312
About six months.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.981
That's what's so awful--
it wasn't even that long.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.683
And then, he just
went insane,

10:49.717 --> 10:51.118
fired me
from my job.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.021
And he's a really big deal
in the culinary world.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.323
Thomas Sorensen.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.158
Yeah, yeah, I've
heard of him.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.993
Right?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.865
Water?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.199
BEN:
No, thanks.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.903
Anyway, I find out
later that...

11:09.937 --> 11:11.905
this is his thing.

11:11.939 --> 11:15.008
I mean, he has a history
of violence against women.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.477
I know that he's stalked
other women before.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.847
Well, did you get
a restraining order?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.015
No, I got an emergency
protective order,

11:22.049 --> 11:23.984
because that's what
they give you first.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.119
But every time that
they try to serve him,

11:26.153 --> 11:28.756
the people that work
in his kitchen,
they protect him.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.357
I can't even get work!

11:30.390 --> 11:32.993
Because he's spreading
all of these rumors about me,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.029
and it's really crazy because
I'm a really good chef!

11:36.063 --> 11:39.099
Sorry.
Okay; it's okay.
It's all right; it's all right.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.069
Okay, look, I'm gonna fill
this out, you're gonna sign it,

11:42.102 --> 11:44.905
and that way we can start
documenting this, all right?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.373
Create a paper trail.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.141
Okay?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.342
All right.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.179
Sign right there.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.487
I'm gonna give you
one of these, too.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.224
All right, if anything happens,
you call 911,

12:04.257 --> 12:06.493
but... you can call me, too.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.095
Thank you.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.329
Yeah.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.865
Ben.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.801
Thank you, Ben.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.502
Yeah.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.842
It's, like, all I've
been doing all day
is handing out cards.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.110
Oh, man.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.377
(laughs)

12:24.411 --> 12:26.046
Sorry.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.148
Just thought maybe
I was special.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.283
(wry laugh)
There's a term for that.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.919
Really.
Yeah.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.987
It's called converting
an on-duty contact

12:34.021 --> 12:36.123
into an off-duty
relationship.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.392
We're not supposed to do it.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.362
Dang.
(laughs)

12:46.900 --> 12:48.836
All right, I'm gonna go.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.973
Really, thank you.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.076
Ben.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.879
(over radio):
U-3, call the watch commander.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.380
U-3, copy.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.287
Sherman.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.224
Can you swing by 2622
South Ardmore, number 12?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.260
Woman wanted to make a report.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.528
There's some kind
of language problem.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.866
I'll have a Korean-speaking
officer meet you there.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.433
Roger that.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.004
Lock your doors.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.943
Look at that.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.378
Look at it.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.081
He's so handsome.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.883
Aw...

13:38.151 --> 13:40.888
Brianna, where's
his crib?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.422
It broke.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.558
I got it second-hand,
and it just fell apart.

13:45.592 --> 13:49.096
He was trying to get out,
and it just busted up.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.964
Brianna, he needs
to have a crib.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.466
Why? He loves sleeping
with me so much.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.904
Hello? You're being
evaluated tomorrow.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.940
Do you want to lose him
for real this time?

13:59.973 --> 14:01.574
LYDIA:
He needs a safe place

14:01.608 --> 14:03.210
to sleep, Brianna.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.378
Do you know how many parents
have killed their children

14:05.412 --> 14:07.948
by rolling over on them
in the middle of the night?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.350
I'm working at the
bakery and at one of
the shelters now,

14:10.383 --> 14:11.919
and baby-sitters
cost a fortune.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.321
I can't afford a new crib.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.189
Why didn't you call me?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.926
I'm a part of
your team, remember?

14:20.127 --> 14:21.594
(sighs)

14:22.996 --> 14:24.932
I'm gonna get you
a crib, okay?

14:24.965 --> 14:28.335
I'll probably have
to have it delivered,
so you need to be here.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.370
I will, I promise.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.372
Thank you so, so much.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.142
I'll pay you back,
I promise.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.409
Okay.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.111
Won't we, Jimmy?
(chuckles)

14:38.145 --> 14:41.048
LYDIA: I'll give you a
call with an ETA.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.053
Bye, Jimmy.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.022
See you later.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.629
(speaking Korean)

14:56.663 --> 14:59.266
So, they got the call
from the school around 9:00.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.969
Their son said his sister
didn't get on the bus with him.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.370
How old are they?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.638
Son Matthew is seven,
and the girl is nine.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.074
Her name is Jane.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.376
(speaking Korean)

15:12.980 --> 15:14.547
The father said
it's not a problem.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.184
She wanders a little bit;
she always comes home.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.987
She "wanders" a lit...
She's nine years old.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.989
(speaking Korean)

15:23.991 --> 15:27.094
(speaking angrily)

15:29.429 --> 15:30.663
He's saying...

15:30.697 --> 15:32.165
he's saying no problem,

15:32.199 --> 15:34.334
they'll take care of it.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.003
(sighs):
All right.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.105
Tell him we're going
to the school right now.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.339
They can follow with you.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.308
(speaking Korean)

15:43.676 --> 15:46.079
Hey, Sarge,
we might have a missing child.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.049
I'm gonna go to the school,
see if she turned up,

15:49.082 --> 15:51.151
talk to the brother.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.326
You gonna sulk now?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.294
I'm not sulking.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.033
Oh, damn. Come on.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.704
(siren chirps)

16:11.738 --> 16:13.673
You're contact;
I'm cover.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.545
Hey! You!

16:18.578 --> 16:20.680
Over here, pull it over.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.189
I'm sitting at the intersection,
he jumps in the car,

16:29.222 --> 16:31.424
says he won't get out
unless I pay him.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.093
I know, sir,
we saw it.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.327
Get out of the
car, please.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.096
That's not what happened.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.664
It was a business
transaction.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.199
I'll pay him.
Get out

16:39.232 --> 16:41.701
of the car, please.
DRIVER:
Here.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.270
Here.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.372
Please, just get
out of my car.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.807
Give him back
the money, Donna.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.809
Dude beckoned me.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.444
Dude didn't
beckon you.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.081
JOHN:
Get out.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.285
Get out of the car.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.552
Now.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.124
How else am I supposed
to make a living?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.292
Business is slow.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.559
We're in a recession.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.295
Next time I'm
gonna arrest you.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.602
This is Hollywood, idiot.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.470
Keep your doors locked.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.507
(starts engine)

17:24.644 --> 17:27.280
Ask 'em, tell 'em, make 'em.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.284
(engine starts)

17:34.854 --> 17:36.856
She didn't get on the bus.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.126
She just walked away.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.128
She does that a lot.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.365
I started crying,
and when I got to school,

17:45.398 --> 17:46.599
I told Miss Pitts.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.335
You did the right
thing, Matthew.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.802
Anybody ever call you Matt?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.239
No.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.175
(quietly):
Okay.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.509
Uh...

17:56.543 --> 17:58.811
Matthew, did you see anybody
at the bus stop

17:58.845 --> 18:02.415
waiting for her
or talking to her
or anything like that?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.151
You sure?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.254
All right, come.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.556
(laughs):
Thank you.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.693
(sighs)

18:13.726 --> 18:15.695
You searched the school
for her, right?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.264
Yeah, of course.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.399
Look, I think she
has Asperger's.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.269
I told the parents, and
the father got very angry,

18:22.302 --> 18:23.870
said she was normal.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.339
We brought in an interventionist
to work with her,

18:26.373 --> 18:27.874
and the father
threatened to sue.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.210
I worry about her
all the time.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.412
She has almost
no friends.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.747
Uh... she likes art.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.384
(gentle laugh)
She keeps building these--

18:37.417 --> 18:39.719
sorry-- these...

18:39.752 --> 18:41.288
structures.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.922
It's weird, huh?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.824
She's kind of
a savant.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.193
Hmm.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.727
Can I keep this?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
Yeah, of course.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.832
I gotta call this in.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.207
Hey, Sarge, we got an
at-risk missing child.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.210
Last seen at a bus stop at
Ardmore and Harvard around 8:00.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.848
She's got a disability.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.351
I think she may have Asperger's.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.690
SALESWOMAN:
You really can't go wrong
with the Storecraft.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.226
LYDIA:
And that's this one
here, right?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.393
We stopped carrying
some others.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.461
Lead problems,
bracket problems,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.463
mattress collapses,
you name it.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.465
Mattress collapses.
Really?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.235
I really like this
one, honey.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.403
You're a gorgeous couple.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.971
Well, thank you.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.440
When are you due?

19:33.473 --> 19:34.841
I'm not pregnant.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.244
I run six miles a day,
do I look fat to you?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.245
Sorry.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.379
Give me your credit card,

19:39.412 --> 19:40.980
we're splitting
this, honey.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.250
That's crazy-- why would
I have to split this with you?

19:43.283 --> 19:45.552
I'm going to pay you back,
it's just for right now.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.260
Thanks, sweetie.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.262
I'll need to have it
delivered.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, room 617, please.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.002
You have an incisional hernia.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.871
What were you doing, sit-ups?

20:04.904 --> 20:07.240
Going for a new
personal best?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.575
Heavy weights?

20:08.608 --> 20:09.976
So what happens now?

20:10.009 --> 20:12.011
The bulge has a loop
of intestine in it.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.980
We gotta go in
and get it.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.717
How about the colostomy
takedown?

20:17.750 --> 20:18.818
Not, not yet.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.353
(phone vibrating)

20:20.387 --> 20:22.622
What about the numbness
and weakness in his leg?

20:22.655 --> 20:23.790
Totally normal.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.325
The blast wave from
the bullet

20:25.358 --> 20:27.026
caused damage to the
lumbrosacral plexus.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.529
Nerves need to heal.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.498
(vibrating continues)
Takes time.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.874
Hey, Russ, I tried you at the
hospital a couple times.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.444
Um, just want to hear
your voice,

20:44.477 --> 20:47.314
say hello, something.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.317
I went and saw Brianna,
um, today.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.320
Jimmy is getting so big.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.323
Anyway, um, give me
a call, partner.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.457
All right?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.426
I love you. Bye.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.342
Yeah, that's it.
Uh, she was last
seen at a bus stop

21:15.375 --> 21:16.743
at, uh, Ardmore and
Harvard around 8:00.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.446
I spoke to your
watch commander.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.880
You're clear from this;
you go back

21:20.913 --> 21:22.549
to handling your calls.
Thanks for your help.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.517
Good work.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.529
(phone rings)

21:36.563 --> 21:37.530
Sherman.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.432
It's, uh, Stella.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.434
Um, Stella Holmes.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.102
Hey. You all right?

21:43.135 --> 21:46.373
No, he keeps calling me
and threatening me.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.874
Where is he right now?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.409
He's at the restaurant.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.410
I can hear the kitchen
in the background.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.444
Um, it's called "Soren."

21:51.478 --> 21:53.380
It's in Silverlake.

21:53.380 --> 21:57.650
I'm sorry. I wouldn't bother you
if I wasn't so scared.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.386
It's just, it was so bad,
you know?

21:59.386 --> 22:01.954
He just, he kept ranting.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.890
Yeah, all right.
Sit tight for a minute.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.392
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

22:05.392 --> 22:06.893
Bye.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.792
MAN:
All right, people,
let's go!

22:39.826 --> 22:42.128
It's gonna be
a full house tonight!

22:42.161 --> 22:43.830
Pick up the energy!

22:43.863 --> 22:45.432
Who are you?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.066
What are you doing
in my kitchen?!

22:47.099 --> 22:49.802
Can I talk
to you outside, please?

22:49.836 --> 22:52.071
Oh, all right,
here we go.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.441
What did she say
I did this time?

22:54.474 --> 22:56.075
Tom Sorenson.

22:56.108 --> 22:59.078
The day I hired
this chick was

22:59.111 --> 23:01.180
the worst day of my life.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.582
Did you meet her?

23:02.615 --> 23:05.051
She seems great, right?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.720
At first, yeah,
she's a total doll,

23:07.754 --> 23:08.721
and then...

23:08.755 --> 23:09.956
I'm onto you.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.058
What'd you just say to me?

23:12.091 --> 23:13.726
I'm onto you.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.765
Arrested for stalking
and trespass in 2008.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.966
Come on, man.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.568
Battery, 2006.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.035
Case dismissed.
D.A. reject.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.571
Date rape, 2006.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.572
No charges filed.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.939
Is that how you do it?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.841
Do you scare 'em into
dropping the charges?

23:32.545 --> 23:35.214
This is no longer
a consensual encounter.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.217
Good-bye.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.952
Where'd you learn
that term?

23:39.986 --> 23:43.523
From the lawyers you hire
after you beat up women?

23:43.556 --> 23:46.526
She was a lousy cook,
and I fired her, okay?

23:46.559 --> 23:49.128
Now you tell her
to stop stalking me!

23:52.064 --> 23:55.101
You touch her...
I'm coming after you.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.674
Have a nice day.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.544
Stay for dinner!

24:04.577 --> 24:05.778
Let's go, people!

24:05.812 --> 24:06.746
Keep it up!

24:09.248 --> 24:11.117
(siren wails briefly,
helicopter flies over)

24:21.060 --> 24:24.163
LYDIA:
Why wasn't he
wearing a helmet?

24:24.196 --> 24:25.965
I told him not to.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.534
You what?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.835
We were filming it.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.538
It's like a Jackass
kind of thing.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.740
Okay.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.608
Famous people
never wear helmets.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.044
You gotta be able
to see their face.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.613
Otherwise,
it could be anyone.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.914
Let me get this
straight.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.884
The end of the stunt
going at 35 miles an hour,

24:44.917 --> 24:48.054
jumping into an
empty swimming pool,

24:48.087 --> 24:49.856
and you told him
not to wear a helmet?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.124
We were gonna put it
on YouTube, man.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.626
It was gonna be radical.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.695
(forced laugh)
I bet.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.297
You know,
it's manslaughter.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.566
He acted recklessly.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.000
Yes, that's exactly why

25:01.033 --> 25:02.635
they're not gonna file
for manslaughter.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.003
So you're saying it's
reckless endangerment?

25:04.036 --> 25:06.172
I'm saying the parents
will never let him say

25:06.205 --> 25:07.874
that he made him
take the helmet off.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.078
It's your call.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.715
These kids aren't
going anywhere.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.950
We'll run it by the DA.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.752
They've got to live
with this

25:19.786 --> 25:21.688
for the rest
of their lives.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.257
(Lydia sighs)

25:27.760 --> 25:29.696
What are you
looking at, pig?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.169
Want to grab
a quick bite?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.639
No, I'm gonna run
by the hospital

25:39.672 --> 25:41.674
and say hi to Russ.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.713
I'lll drop you off
at the station, all right?

25:46.746 --> 25:48.615
You think that's a good idea,

25:48.648 --> 25:50.617
you going to see him
all the time?

25:50.650 --> 25:52.151
What?

25:52.184 --> 25:54.621
I mean, he's lying
in a hospital bed,

25:54.621 --> 25:56.656
and you're still
calling him "partner."

25:56.689 --> 25:58.324
That can't make him feel good.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.227
You should let him go
a little bit.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.062
You're telling me
how to treat this man

26:03.095 --> 26:05.164
you've never even
met before?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.666
You're kidding me, right?

26:06.699 --> 26:09.636
Look, you don't know
anything about us.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.938
You don't know anything
about our bond.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.674
I'm just trying
to give him hope

26:14.707 --> 26:17.076
and let him know
I'm still there for him.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.711
I'm sorry.

26:18.745 --> 26:22.014
I'm just saying calling him
"partner" all the time

26:22.048 --> 26:23.816
and trying to keep him
up-to-date with cases,

26:23.850 --> 26:26.719
I just think,
I don't know...

26:26.753 --> 26:30.757
Look, just stay out of it,
all right?! It's none...!

26:30.790 --> 26:34.060
It's none of your business,
all right?

26:44.871 --> 26:47.039
You're driving

26:47.073 --> 26:48.307
too close to them.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.810
What are you trying
to do, the PIT maneuver?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.411
(siren blips)

26:52.444 --> 26:54.814
Look in your rearview mirror.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.749
See the dope they
just threw

26:56.783 --> 26:58.117
out of the car?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.688
If you weren't so far
up their ass,

27:01.721 --> 27:03.723
you'd have seen that.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.697
Go get the dope.

27:13.766 --> 27:17.336
(over P.A.):
Driver, put your hands outside
the car where I can see them.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.739
Passenger!

27:19.772 --> 27:22.408
Put your hands outside of the
vehicle where I can see them.

27:22.441 --> 27:26.412
COMMUNICATIONS (over radio):
U-3, report back
to 2622 South Ardmore.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.748
See the mother
of the missing child.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.117
U-3. Roger that.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.724
Ma'am, please
come over here,

27:37.724 --> 27:41.093
kneel down, and lay flat
on your stomach.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.929
I can't.
CHICKIE:
Ma'am?

27:42.962 --> 27:45.164
I'm pregnant.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.833
Keep your eyes on her.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.300
Control her.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.769
Don't look at me!

27:51.470 --> 27:54.106
Ma'am, come over here.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.744
Felony kneeling.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.812
Kneel down,
put your hands above your head.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.047
Now!

28:01.080 --> 28:02.314
Do it!

28:02.348 --> 28:03.816
(clears throat)

28:03.850 --> 28:05.785
Hands above your head!

28:05.818 --> 28:07.854
(woman grunts)

28:11.490 --> 28:13.259
(quietly):
No frigging command presence.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.796
(sighs)

28:16.829 --> 28:19.365
She said you
had kind eyes.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.333
(speaking Korean)

28:24.771 --> 28:27.373
She wants to show you something
in the house.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.341
(speaking Korean)

28:47.860 --> 28:49.796
(speaking Korean)

28:53.399 --> 28:56.235
Yeah? Uh, ask her if
they've ever taken Jane there.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.370
(speaking Korean)

29:00.339 --> 29:02.141
JASON:
Never.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.999
Jane!

29:27.033 --> 29:28.134
Jane?!

29:30.469 --> 29:33.372
Jane?!
WOMAN:
Hey!

29:33.405 --> 29:34.573
What...?

29:34.606 --> 29:37.209
I'm sorry.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.311
I'm sorry; I'm looking
for somebody; I'm sorry.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.988
Yo! Yo, excuse me.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.857
Great. Thanks.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.992
I'm looking for a little girl,
nine years old, Korean.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.226
You see anything
like that?

29:54.260 --> 29:56.896
Uh, what kind of
car was she driving?

29:56.929 --> 30:00.232
Look, if I had seen a little
girl walking by herself,

30:00.266 --> 30:02.969
don't think I'd
turn her in?

30:03.002 --> 30:04.103
Try the west garage.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.471
Um, got a card?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.439
Yeah.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.078
Okay. Give you a call
if she turns up.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.850
What are you doing?

30:17.884 --> 30:18.851
I'm writing.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.087
What are you writing?

30:22.121 --> 30:23.555
My blog.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.192
Thought you were gonna
give that up.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.493
No.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.362
Why would I stop
blogging about my life?

30:30.396 --> 30:33.499
Did you write
about me getting shot?

30:33.532 --> 30:35.467
Yes.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.438
It happened to me,
too, Russell.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.572
Oh, did it, Dina?

30:40.606 --> 30:42.274
(scoffing laugh)

30:42.308 --> 30:43.910
'Cause I don't see you
lying in bed

30:43.943 --> 30:45.477
with a piss bag
and tubes coming out of you.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.079
I don't see you having
your intestines carved out.

30:47.113 --> 30:48.647
I don't see you
limping around here...

30:48.680 --> 30:50.049
WOMAN: You got time.
Visiting hours are
still another hour.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.517
Come on in.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.285
...you're probably never gonna
get to do again!

30:55.187 --> 30:58.157
It's not a good time.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.327
Um, yeah. I'm sorry.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.069
...'cause she's obsessed
with the Nokia Center.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.503
She does drawings,
paintings.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.672
I don't know.
She's...

31:13.705 --> 31:16.442
Is there any way people
can get back up in here?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.655
You got
any other monitors?

31:29.688 --> 31:31.023
Mm-mm.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.091
Any other angles, anything?

31:32.124 --> 31:33.592
(Ben sighs)

31:33.625 --> 31:34.961
All right.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.677
Are you Jane?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.513
The stage measures
14,000 square feet.

31:54.546 --> 31:58.284
No seat is further than
220 feet from the stage.

31:58.317 --> 32:02.054
Orchestra has 4,340 seats.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.124
The seats are
23 1/2 inches wide.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.259
That's great.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.595
Great.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.698
Okay. Come on.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.369
BEN:
It's not a problem.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.570
MOTHER:
Thank you. Thank you.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.139
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.408
You just make sure
you get her some help.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.576
Okay? Make sure you
get her help? Yeah?

32:25.444 --> 32:26.545
It's okay.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.713
No problem.
No problem.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.615
(phone ringing)

32:29.648 --> 32:31.150
Sherman.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.551
STELLA (on phone):
Ben, it's Stella.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.086
I think he's here.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.055
I keep hearing things
outside my doorway

32:36.088 --> 32:37.256
and I think he's got a key.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.358
All right.
Hang up and call 911.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.193
Do it now, Stella!

32:41.227 --> 32:44.530
See, the thing
with police work?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.298
It's a perishable skill.

32:46.332 --> 32:50.502
You know, you don't
use it, you lose it.

32:54.040 --> 32:58.077
Maybe you're not cut out
for the street anymore.

32:58.110 --> 33:02.548
Then you can go over to the
communications division.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.384
Just... shut up.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.187
Okay?

33:10.456 --> 33:12.424
You want to take a gun
off the street?

33:20.266 --> 33:22.134
Sir. Stop.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.435
Turn around.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.105
Put your hands
in the air.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.207
Turn around.
Put your hands in the air.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.112
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.081
Spread your legs.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.151
(siren approaches)

33:55.201 --> 33:56.602
How'd you know
he had a gun?

33:56.635 --> 33:59.171
I have cop eyes,
just the same as you.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.454
You missed this one.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.136
(siren wailing)

34:55.927 --> 34:57.829
(grunts)

35:02.301 --> 35:04.636
(sirens approach)

35:06.238 --> 35:07.639
Breathe!

35:07.673 --> 35:10.242
Breathe!
Breathe!

35:10.276 --> 35:11.743
Come on, breathe!
Breathe!

35:11.777 --> 35:13.645
Sherm! Sherm,
we got this!
Breathe!

35:13.679 --> 35:15.247
We got it!

35:15.281 --> 35:17.849
(panting)

35:17.883 --> 35:21.287
Do something!
Help her!

35:21.320 --> 35:25.691
OFFICER:
Control 118-16 to 1097.
We're code four on that 242.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.594
Be advised. Victim is
nonresponsive at this time.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.666
(shouts)

35:34.700 --> 35:36.668
(enraged yelling)

35:36.702 --> 35:39.405
(panting)

35:43.975 --> 35:45.211
(angry grunt)

35:49.848 --> 35:52.251
(lock buzzes)

35:52.284 --> 35:54.220
(door thuds open)

36:14.005 --> 36:15.607
You okay?

36:15.641 --> 36:17.643
Fine.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.819
Everybody's congratulating me
like I did something great.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.788
I hit that guy, hard.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.892
He had cuffs on.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.930
I don't know
where the lines are.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.438
You got a lot of
power out there.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.809
You can't get control of it,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.847
Look, everyone, when
they get out of the academy,

36:55.881 --> 36:57.449
thinks it's all
black and white.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.285
But you know what?
It isn't.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.424
We live in the gray.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.462
We live there.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.401
Now you know what
you're capable of.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.858
That's it!

37:39.891 --> 37:42.961
Huh? Who...?

37:42.994 --> 37:44.430
You?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.465
How could you
do this to me?

37:46.498 --> 37:47.899
You deserved it.

37:47.933 --> 37:52.070
Coming in here
with your fancy pictures,

37:52.103 --> 37:54.039
thinking you're
all that.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.515
Hey, I'm sorry
about before.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.485
No, it's all right.
I...

38:06.518 --> 38:09.020
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.757
Like you said,
none of my damn business.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.361
No, I think
you're right.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.828
(sighs)

38:16.862 --> 38:18.564
I need to give
him his space.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.868
I woke up today

38:22.901 --> 38:24.503
'cause I had a
dream about him.

38:24.536 --> 38:27.373
I was in the shoot-out,

38:27.373 --> 38:29.375
but I wasn't
shooting Marta's kid.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.976
I was...

38:31.009 --> 38:32.944
shooting Russell.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.047
It just... I don't know.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.016
It just stuck
with me all day.

38:40.386 --> 38:43.088
It must be hard.

38:43.121 --> 38:45.090
Knowing how much
he loved it.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.859
Not knowing
if he'll make it back.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.965
Survivor's guilt
or whatever they call it.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.436
You know what?

38:57.469 --> 38:59.538
Let's go get a drink.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.672
Yes.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.408
Yes, okay.
Let's go.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.542
Oh, w-where?

39:03.575 --> 39:05.143
Where?

39:05.176 --> 39:07.913
Yeah, Hollywood,
you're so slick.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.115
I don't want to end
up on Sunset Strip

39:10.148 --> 39:13.985
with a bunch of teenagers
drinking fancy $20 martinis.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.754
Did you just call me
Hollywood?

39:15.787 --> 39:17.456
I did.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.425
Hollywood?

39:19.458 --> 39:20.559
* Hollywood.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.694
You do know
I'm from the Bronx?

39:22.728 --> 39:24.430
(siren wailing in distance)

39:24.430 --> 39:26.432
(dog barking in distance)

39:53.959 --> 39:55.894
(sniffs)

40:03.001 --> 40:04.936
Thanks for coming.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.145
I once had to do
CPR on a baby.

40:16.247 --> 40:21.487
Was eight...
nine months old.

40:23.555 --> 40:27.225
(grunts)

40:27.258 --> 40:31.763
She had choked on
a piece of apple.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.833
(sighs)

40:34.866 --> 40:39.805
By the time I got there,
she was dead, but, uh...

40:39.838 --> 40:41.773
I couldn't stop.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.546
I'd give her two breaths,
compressed her chest,

40:47.579 --> 40:49.147
two more breaths,
compressed again,

40:49.180 --> 40:52.083
just over
and over and over.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.254
(sighs deeply)

40:56.287 --> 40:58.824
I dreamt about her
for a long time after that.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.027
A couple years.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.533
(sighs)

41:09.234 --> 41:11.637
Once in a while,
I still dream about her.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.643
That I save her.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.551
You can't save
everyone.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.966
Owes me a favor.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.935
(lift whirring)
