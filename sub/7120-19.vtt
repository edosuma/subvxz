00:18.781 --> 00:20.113
Happy birthday!

00:20.182 --> 00:21.650
Jake? Is that you?

00:21.717 --> 00:22.717
I can't see.

00:22.785 --> 00:23.878
Right. That's because...

00:23.953 --> 00:24.852
I'm blind!

00:24.920 --> 00:26.388
Jake, I'm blind on my birthday!

00:26.455 --> 00:28.447
No, dude, you're blindfolded.

00:28.524 --> 00:30.720
- Oh.
- Keep the blindfold on.

00:30.793 --> 00:31.988
I've got a surprise for you.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.700
Surprise!

00:38.734 --> 00:40.965
Orange blindfold?

00:41.036 --> 00:42.732
<i>That is a surprise!</i>

00:42.805 --> 00:44.330
That's not the surprise.

00:44.406 --> 00:45.499
This is.

00:45.574 --> 00:47.042
You got me a train?

00:47.109 --> 00:49.078
Thank you, Jake!

00:49.144 --> 00:50.840
This isn't the gift.

00:50.913 --> 00:51.846
Huh?

00:51.914 --> 00:54.110
We have to take the train
to get to the gift.

00:54.183 --> 00:55.183
Oh.

00:55.217 --> 00:56.981
Almost as cool as a free train.

00:57.052 --> 00:58.350
Eh.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.820
I'll go get the tickets.

00:59.888 --> 01:01.151
Okay.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.627
Hey, Mr. Conductor!

01:07.696 --> 01:09.255
It's my birthday!

01:09.331 --> 01:10.924
Oh?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.469
Climb aboard my
train, little boy.

01:13.535 --> 01:15.026
You're my new friend.

01:17.973 --> 01:21.410
All aboard!

01:22.378 --> 01:24.313
This is gonna be the
best birthday ever.

01:25.314 --> 01:28.580
I'm gonna go grab a schedule.

01:29.585 --> 01:30.780
Whoa!

01:30.853 --> 01:33.584
Oh, t-terribly sorry, Colonel.

01:33.656 --> 01:35.989
Oh, oh, well, that's all right.

01:36.058 --> 01:38.027
Just don't let it happen again.

01:40.095 --> 01:41.893
Sorry about that, folks.

01:41.964 --> 01:44.695
We are approaching
Gumball Gulch now.

01:44.767 --> 01:46.633
The ride's gonna
get a little bumpy

01:46.702 --> 01:47.982
until we reach the straightaway,

01:48.037 --> 01:50.199
so you might want to buckle up.

01:56.078 --> 01:57.569
Found a schedule.

01:57.646 --> 01:58.646
Great.

01:58.681 --> 02:00.673
Now find your seatbelt.

02:03.686 --> 02:05.052
Geez Louise.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.715
Uh, s-sorry about that, Colonel.

02:07.790 --> 02:08.917
B-Beg your pardon.

02:08.991 --> 02:10.151
Oh, sorry.

02:10.225 --> 02:11.386
Uh... whoa!

02:11.460 --> 02:13.190
Ugh! Aah!

02:16.131 --> 02:18.623
Colonel, I am so sorry.

02:18.701 --> 02:20.636
Hey, we're in the straightaway.

02:20.703 --> 02:21.727
Ooh, I want to see.

02:24.006 --> 02:26.202
I'm gonna kill you!

02:31.480 --> 02:33.073
Aah! Aah!

02:33.148 --> 02:34.480
Aah!

02:34.550 --> 02:36.849
A skeleton.

02:36.919 --> 02:39.184
Is he going to be okay, Dr.
Donut?

02:39.254 --> 02:40.347
He doesn't look good.

02:40.422 --> 02:42.618
Hey, man, this is
kind of a bad scene.

02:42.691 --> 02:44.159
Maybe we should get
off this train

02:44.226 --> 02:45.694
and hoof it to your surprise.

02:45.761 --> 02:47.423
Are you kidding?

02:47.496 --> 02:49.465
It's a murder
mystery on a train,

02:49.531 --> 02:51.397
and we're gonna solve it.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.265
All right.

02:53.335 --> 02:55.964
What do you think, Dr.
Donut? Any clues?

02:56.038 --> 02:56.869
Hmm.

02:56.939 --> 02:58.669
I think it was the
guy who screamed,

02:58.741 --> 03:00.403
"I'm gonna kill you."

03:02.745 --> 03:04.805
Uh, no, no, it... it...
it wasn't me.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
I swear!

03:05.948 --> 03:07.780
Passengers, passengers,

03:07.850 --> 03:09.819
I don't think it was
Colonel Candycorn.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.353
Oh, well, well, thank you.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.820
No, in murder mysteries,

03:12.888 --> 03:14.789
it's never the first
person you think of...

03:14.857 --> 03:16.189
Never, ever.

03:16.258 --> 03:17.886
So, who do you think it is?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.725
Colonel, do you have any
enemies on this train?

03:20.796 --> 03:23.857
Well, uh... well, just one.

03:23.932 --> 03:26.492
And his or her name is...

03:30.539 --> 03:31.768
See?

03:31.840 --> 03:33.308
I knew it wasn't him.

03:33.375 --> 03:36.641
But now we have to figure
out who his enemy is.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.977
It could be anybody.

03:39.047 --> 03:41.016
It could even be you.

03:41.083 --> 03:45.248
Yes, it could, except
I didn't do it.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.913
But we don't know that.

03:46.989 --> 03:49.982
You singled me out to take
suspicion off yourself.

03:50.058 --> 03:51.583
Are you Colonel
Candycorn's enemy?

03:51.660 --> 03:52.753
What? No.

03:52.828 --> 03:54.888
I was just trying to join
in on the conversation.

03:54.963 --> 03:56.591
Suspect numero uno!

03:59.468 --> 04:01.027
Rat traps.

04:01.103 --> 04:03.163
I really thought I
was on to something.

04:03.238 --> 04:05.173
Now, I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

04:05.240 --> 04:07.141
but what about the conductor?

04:07.209 --> 04:09.508
No, it's definitely not him.

04:09.578 --> 04:10.705
Aw. Why not?

04:10.779 --> 04:12.338
Because he's weird and creepy,

04:12.414 --> 04:14.007
and you never suspect
the creepy guy

04:14.082 --> 04:15.209
because it's too obvious.

04:15.284 --> 04:16.284
Whatever, man.

04:16.351 --> 04:18.115
I'm gonna go sit and
look at the schedule.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.486
We're running out of suspects.

04:23.559 --> 04:25.050
And we're running out of time.

04:25.127 --> 04:26.127
Attention.

04:27.095 --> 04:29.655
Attention, passengers.

04:29.731 --> 04:30.731
Gnarly.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.969
Yeah. Hi. It's me...
the conductor.

04:36.405 --> 04:37.930
Anyway, I couldn't
help overhearing

04:38.006 --> 04:41.033
that someone here thinks
I'm weird and creepy.

04:41.109 --> 04:43.943
And, you know, I'm not
weird and creepy.

04:46.381 --> 04:47.747
I'm cool and awesome.

04:54.957 --> 04:57.825
Happy birthday, Finn.

05:00.262 --> 05:01.560
Hey, Jake?

05:01.630 --> 05:02.654
Yeah?

05:02.731 --> 05:04.632
The conductor was just here,

05:04.700 --> 05:07.260
and he was weirder and
creepier than before.

05:07.336 --> 05:08.929
What?! No way.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.438
He was cool and awesome.

05:10.505 --> 05:12.565
Anyway, it's still not him.

05:12.641 --> 05:16.009
No, the murderer is
right here among us.

05:16.078 --> 05:19.412
Isn't that right, doctor?

05:19.481 --> 05:21.313
You think it was me?

05:21.383 --> 05:23.318
When Candycane guy was murdered,

05:23.385 --> 05:26.184
you diverted suspicion
towards Colonel Candycorn,

05:26.255 --> 05:29.487
then killed him to
protect your alibi.

05:29.558 --> 05:31.322
Are you kidding?

05:31.393 --> 05:33.828
Dude, I think you're way off.

05:33.896 --> 05:37.094
Am I? Or am I way on?

05:40.269 --> 05:41.269
Son of a...

05:43.171 --> 05:44.935
My hunches aren't
getting me anywhere.

05:45.007 --> 05:46.805
The killer is
laughing at us, Jake.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.571
What do you think we should do?

05:48.644 --> 05:50.044
Hmm.

05:50.112 --> 05:52.138
We need hard evidence.

05:53.282 --> 05:54.841
Ha!

05:56.718 --> 05:58.380
A basket of eggs,
fish, and cabbage.

06:01.723 --> 06:03.817
It's a receipt from an
earlier train ride,

06:03.892 --> 06:06.293
from another train.

06:06.361 --> 06:08.296
Jake, I found a book.

06:08.363 --> 06:10.855
It's a dictionary.

06:13.101 --> 06:15.661
It's sheet music!

06:17.239 --> 06:19.265
It doesn't make any sense to me.

06:19.341 --> 06:20.274
Me neither.

06:20.342 --> 06:22.053
Maybe the murderer is
just too smart for us.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.103
Yes! Jake, that's it.

06:24.179 --> 06:25.579
It's all so clear now.

06:25.647 --> 06:27.115
Gather everyone in the caboose,

06:27.182 --> 06:31.119
and I will reveal a murderer.

06:31.186 --> 06:33.553
You're the only
remaining passengers,

06:33.622 --> 06:36.217
so the murderer is
in this caboose.

06:39.594 --> 06:42.359
Let me explain how I know
who the murderer is.

06:42.431 --> 06:45.230
I saw Pineapple Guy skim
through the sheet music,

06:45.300 --> 06:47.201
sheet music to a song

06:47.269 --> 06:49.738
that's very special
to Lollipop Girl,

06:49.805 --> 06:53.606
a song that reminds
her of Ice Cream Guy.

06:53.675 --> 06:55.405
Before Colonel Candycorn died,

06:55.477 --> 06:58.311
Dr. Ice Cream was in
possession of a basket

06:58.380 --> 07:01.214
of cabbage, fish, and eggs.

07:01.283 --> 07:03.115
And you, Pineapple Guy,

07:03.185 --> 07:06.349
have cabbage bits on your socks.

07:06.421 --> 07:09.414
And you, Chocolate Bar Guy...

07:09.491 --> 07:11.653
Does this dictionary
look familiar,

07:11.727 --> 07:15.255
a dictionary which happens
to contain the words

07:15.330 --> 07:16.370
"rid," "guests," "at once."

07:21.003 --> 07:24.804
But the real murderer is
someone no one suspects.

07:24.873 --> 07:27.274
The real murderer is...

07:30.212 --> 07:31.840
No one was the murderer?

07:31.913 --> 07:33.745
The conductor's
still on the train.

07:33.815 --> 07:35.807
Oh, yeah. He did it.

07:35.884 --> 07:38.149
Yay! You did it! You
solved it, Finn!

07:38.220 --> 07:40.052
I knew it... because
he's creepy.

07:40.122 --> 07:41.954
What?! Hmph.

07:42.024 --> 07:45.085
I know... you knew he was
the murderer all along.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.994
I couldn't have done
it without you,

07:48.063 --> 07:50.532
you, you, you.

07:50.599 --> 07:51.760
Thank you.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.667
We make a great team, pal.

07:56.638 --> 07:57.936
You feel kind of bony.

07:58.006 --> 08:00.566
Aah!

08:00.642 --> 08:01.642
Jake?

08:03.478 --> 08:04.478
No!

08:09.351 --> 08:10.284
Hey.

08:10.352 --> 08:12.685
How could you murder all
those candy people?

08:12.754 --> 08:15.246
And you murdered
Jake on my birthday!

08:15.323 --> 08:18.259
Yes, and you're next.

08:20.128 --> 08:21.128
Wrong.

08:22.064 --> 08:24.124
Grr!

08:24.199 --> 08:25.199
Hunh!

08:25.233 --> 08:26.233
Unh!

08:30.872 --> 08:32.465
Mnh!

08:32.541 --> 08:36.376
No!!

08:43.784 --> 08:45.253
Ah!

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
Unh!

08:57.132 --> 08:59.101
I'm coming for you!

08:59.167 --> 09:00.897
Unh!

09:00.969 --> 09:01.969
Ugh!

09:04.906 --> 09:06.374
This is for Jake!

09:06.441 --> 09:07.272
Hunh!

09:07.342 --> 09:08.173
Unh!

09:08.243 --> 09:09.404
Hyah!

09:12.114 --> 09:13.241
You're going down,

09:13.315 --> 09:14.681
or both of us are going down.

09:16.785 --> 09:19.880
My birthday wish is vengeance!

09:19.955 --> 09:21.981
Happy birthday to me!

09:22.057 --> 09:23.525
Wait!

09:25.961 --> 09:27.429
Y-You're alive!

09:28.864 --> 09:30.341
You were the conductor
the whole time?

09:30.365 --> 09:31.389
Yep.

09:31.466 --> 09:32.991
You were so busy
focused on the murders

09:33.068 --> 09:35.435
that you never even noticed.

09:40.575 --> 09:42.009
The skeletons were
the hardest part.

09:44.379 --> 09:45.379
Aah! Aah!

09:45.413 --> 09:47.746
Aah!

09:47.816 --> 09:49.148
It was all an elaborate setup

09:49.217 --> 09:50.412
for your birthday present.

09:50.485 --> 09:52.078
So nobody was murdered?

09:52.154 --> 09:55.318
Nope, not unless you count
the train's control panel.

09:59.661 --> 10:01.857
Aah!

10:01.930 --> 10:02.930
Aah!

10:05.934 --> 10:07.266
Aah!

10:07.335 --> 10:10.271
Dude, open your eyes.

10:10.338 --> 10:13.001
Hey, we're alive!

10:14.576 --> 10:17.637
♪ ...to you ♪

10:17.712 --> 10:19.112
Wow.

10:19.181 --> 10:20.877
This is the best birthday ever.

10:20.949 --> 10:22.042
Thanks, Jake.

10:22.117 --> 10:23.117
You deserve it, buddy,

10:23.185 --> 10:24.585
'cause you're a great friend.

10:24.653 --> 10:26.144
I think my favorite part

10:26.221 --> 10:27.655
was landing on the gelatin.

10:27.722 --> 10:29.384
That must have taken
forever to plan.

10:29.457 --> 10:30.857
Nope.

10:30.926 --> 10:32.326
That part was a total accident.

10:34.696 --> 10:35.629
Oh.

10:35.697 --> 10:37.689
So we could have...
- Died horribly?

10:37.766 --> 10:39.598
Yes.

10:39.668 --> 10:42.297
Happy birthday, pal!
