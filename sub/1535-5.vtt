WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:05.814
Hey, I read
that someone invented a way

00:05.817 --> 00:08.234
to convert your footsteps
into electromagnetic energy

00:08.236 --> 00:10.153
so you can charge
your cell phone while walking.

00:10.155 --> 00:12.405
We had that idea years ago.

00:12.407 --> 00:14.273
How come we never
did anything with it?

00:14.275 --> 00:16.776
Probably because we left the
diagram of it in the restaurant,

00:16.778 --> 00:19.212
and none of us
wanted to walk back.

00:19.214 --> 00:23.082
I know the real reason you never
made progress with that idea.

00:23.084 --> 00:24.534
You thought of it

00:24.536 --> 00:26.586
September 22, 2007.

00:26.588 --> 00:28.955
Two days later, Penny moved in,

00:28.957 --> 00:31.124
and so much blood rushed
to your genitals,

00:31.126 --> 00:33.042
your brain became a ghost town.

00:34.763 --> 00:36.746
That's not what happened.

00:36.748 --> 00:38.464
I remember it distinctly

00:38.466 --> 00:40.767
because I had just
composed my annual poem

00:40.769 --> 00:43.720
commemorating the anniversary
of Dr. Seuss's death.

00:43.722 --> 00:44.971
No one wants
to hear it.

00:44.973 --> 00:46.472
Why, die.

00:46.474 --> 00:48.024
Why did he die?

00:48.026 --> 00:49.359
Old, told.

00:49.361 --> 00:51.310
I was told he was old.

00:51.312 --> 00:54.614
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

00:54.616 --> 00:56.733
Oh, really?
Since meeting her,

00:56.735 --> 00:58.901
what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

00:58.903 --> 01:00.036
Easy.

01:00.038 --> 01:02.038
Sleeping with Penny.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.824
Getting Penny to go back out
with him after she dumped him.

01:04.825 --> 01:07.160
Tricking Penny
into getting engaged.

01:07.162 --> 01:10.329
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

01:11.416 --> 01:14.484
I think
someone owes me an apology.

01:14.486 --> 01:16.836
Well, don't feel bad.

01:16.838 --> 01:18.971
I think we've all
been distracted

01:18.973 --> 01:20.790
since the girls
entered our lives.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.592
You admit Amy's a distraction?

01:22.594 --> 01:25.178
Oh, very much so.
Listen to this.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.180
This is from two days ago.

01:27.182 --> 01:29.849
“Hi. Hope you're having
a good day.”

01:29.851 --> 01:32.385
Who has time
for this constant sexting?

01:33.188 --> 01:36.689
Well, maybe
we <i> have</i> lost our focus.

01:36.691 --> 01:40.326
It wouldn't kill us to get
together and brainstorm ideas.

01:40.328 --> 01:42.862
Ooh, we could have one
of those retreats.

01:42.864 --> 01:44.247
Like our own science retreat.

01:44.249 --> 01:46.499
My cousin has a cabin
out in the woods.

01:46.501 --> 01:48.868
I'm not going to a
cabin in the woods.

01:48.870 --> 01:52.121
Did you see the movie
<i>Cabin in the Woods?</i>

01:52.123 --> 01:53.423
Then we'll go to a hotel.

01:53.425 --> 01:56.592
A hotel?
Did you see <i> The Shining?</i>

01:56.594 --> 01:58.511
We could go up

01:58.513 --> 02:00.763
to Big Bear
and get a house on the lake.

02:00.765 --> 02:03.382
Did you see
<i>The Lake House?</i>

02:03.384 --> 02:05.718
Nothing bad happens
in <i> The Lake House.</i>

02:05.720 --> 02:09.088
Yeah, well, no,
not to them. To me.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.223
Time traveling mailbox.

02:10.225 --> 02:11.441
The only time that traveled

02:11.443 --> 02:14.143
was an hour and half
of my life down the toilet.

02:14.145 --> 02:15.945
Fine. Then we'll just stay here
and do it.

02:15.947 --> 02:17.647
Well, you didn't suggest
a beach house.

02:17.649 --> 02:18.998
You would go to a beach house?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.367
Well, good Lord, no--
have you seen <i> Jaws?</i>

02:51.660 --> 02:53.276
Hey.
Hey.

02:53.278 --> 02:54.911
So, the guys and
I are talking

02:54.913 --> 02:57.113
about having kind of a
science retreat this weekend.

02:57.115 --> 02:58.365
I just wanted to
know if that's okay.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.333
You and I had talked about
going to brunch on Sunday...

03:00.335 --> 03:01.785
Want to go to Vegas
this weekend?

03:01.787 --> 03:02.919
Of course I do.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.087
Bernadette?

03:04.089 --> 03:05.422
Girl's weekend.
Vegas. You in?

03:05.424 --> 03:07.007
Hell, yeah!
Yes!

03:07.009 --> 03:09.125
I'll check flights.
I'll check hotels.

03:09.127 --> 03:11.544
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited, I think I peed.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.288 --> 03:22.472
They seem okay with it.

03:26.028 --> 03:28.194
Hey.

03:28.196 --> 03:30.113
Hey.
Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.

03:30.115 --> 03:31.614
Why not?
Well, 'cause you have

03:31.616 --> 03:33.149
a steady girlfriend now,
and we assumed

03:33.151 --> 03:36.369
you'd have to stay home to lower
the food down to her in the pit.

03:40.909 --> 03:44.160
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

03:44.162 --> 03:46.446
Yeah, one would assume,
on getting out of the pit.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.133
Okay, let's focus.

03:50.135 --> 03:52.052
The girls are gone,
we have 48 hours.

03:52.054 --> 03:54.387
There are no distractions.
Let's change the world.

03:54.389 --> 03:56.973
Thinking caps on.
Here we go.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.475
Ooh, this is exciting.
We're innovating.

03:58.477 --> 04:00.477
I feel like
we're in the Facebook movie.

04:00.479 --> 04:02.095
Oh. I never saw that.

04:02.097 --> 04:03.897
- Yeah. Really?
- Oh.

04:03.899 --> 04:06.015
It's wonderful, and I swear
I'm not saying that

04:06.017 --> 04:08.184
because Justin Timberlake
is in it.

04:09.354 --> 04:11.154
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

04:11.156 --> 04:12.522
We should watch it.

04:12.524 --> 04:14.741
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

04:15.577 --> 04:16.993
Guys...

04:16.995 --> 04:18.327
in 30 seconds, we went from

04:18.329 --> 04:20.713
“Let's change the world”
to “Let's watch TV.”

04:21.450 --> 04:24.317
I'm sorry. Is that a “no”?

04:24.319 --> 04:25.668
Okay. No.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.920
Leonard's right.
We're here to focus.

04:26.922 --> 04:29.005
Didn't we used
to have a list of all our ideas?

04:29.007 --> 04:30.707
I-I think I still have it.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.392
I did not get a clear answer.

04:32.394 --> 04:34.511
I'm gonna set this down now.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.097
Ah, here it is.

04:37.099 --> 04:38.765
Whoa.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.550
I haven't looked
at these in years.

04:40.552 --> 04:42.218
“Robot girlfriend.”

04:42.220 --> 04:44.521
Mm, that was mine.

04:44.523 --> 04:47.891
“Robot prostitute.”

04:47.893 --> 04:50.443
Also mine.

04:50.445 --> 04:51.711
Wait. I'm confused.

04:51.713 --> 04:53.663
Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend

04:53.665 --> 04:55.231
and a robot prostitute?

04:55.233 --> 04:56.900
There's just some things
you don't do

04:56.902 --> 04:58.518
with your robot girlfriend.

05:00.739 --> 05:02.405
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

05:02.407 --> 05:05.158
the field of robotics
really took a hit.

05:06.077 --> 05:07.293
Okay, let's just skip

05:07.295 --> 05:09.913
all the inventions
you can have sex with.

05:15.754 --> 05:17.887
All right, no-- here we go:

05:17.889 --> 05:19.722
“Ergonomic heated seat cushion”"

05:19.724 --> 05:21.257
No, it vibrates.
Keep going.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.729
You know, let's just come up
with something new.

05:26.731 --> 05:28.064
You know,

05:28.066 --> 05:30.266
a number of significant
innovations have been inspired

05:30.268 --> 05:31.768
by science fiction.

05:31.770 --> 05:34.437
The-the geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

05:34.439 --> 05:37.607
The Motorola flip phone--
that came from <i> Star Trek.</i>

05:37.609 --> 05:39.943
Yeah, and I've long suspected
that the idea

05:39.945 --> 05:42.045
of an African-American president
was stolen

05:42.047 --> 05:44.797
from the movie <i> Deep Impact.</i>

05:45.784 --> 05:47.417
Hey,

05:47.419 --> 05:49.936
the future they show
in <i> Back to the Future II</i>

05:49.938 --> 05:51.671
is only a year away.

05:51.673 --> 05:54.207
A lot of the things in that
movie haven't been invented yet.

05:54.209 --> 05:55.425
How cool would that be

05:55.427 --> 05:56.960
if we could make
one of those a reality?

05:56.962 --> 05:59.045
If we could figure out
the scientific basis

05:59.047 --> 06:00.296
for Marty's hover board,

06:00.298 --> 06:02.732
that would have
universal application.

06:02.734 --> 06:04.968
Well, it's-it's possible
at absolute zero,

06:04.970 --> 06:06.119
but we would
have to remove

06:06.121 --> 06:07.804
the temperature restrictions.

06:07.806 --> 06:09.088
Oh, I have an idea.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.356
I think I have the same one.

06:10.358 --> 06:12.492
We got to watch
<i>Back to the Future II!</i>

06:13.311 --> 06:16.529
I'll make the popcorn.

06:18.984 --> 06:20.533
So, where should
we go first?

06:20.535 --> 06:21.668
Ooh.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.319
There's a cover band
in the lounge.

06:23.321 --> 06:25.388
Nah.
But they play Barry Manilow.

06:25.390 --> 06:29.342
No.
But they're called “Fairly Manilow”"

06:30.245 --> 06:31.628
Oh. Okay.

06:31.630 --> 06:33.162
Great!
No!

06:34.082 --> 06:36.132
Well, what do you want
to do?

06:36.134 --> 06:37.467
Well, we're in Vegas.

06:37.469 --> 06:39.819
I want to go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas,

06:39.821 --> 06:42.005
dance until I vomit
all over a roulette wheel

06:42.007 --> 06:43.523
and watch it go everywhere.

06:44.843 --> 06:46.342
What if we don't want to vomit?

06:46.344 --> 06:49.262
Oh, you will. That's why
they give you the bucket.

06:50.432 --> 06:52.098
Uh-oh.
What?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.600
It's my boss.

06:53.602 --> 06:55.685
They moved my field ride
up to Monday.

06:55.687 --> 06:56.819
What does that mean?

06:56.821 --> 06:58.938
It means instead
of having a week to study,

06:58.940 --> 07:00.189
I only have two days.

07:00.191 --> 07:01.324
That sucks.

07:01.326 --> 07:02.976
Can you start
in the morning?

07:02.978 --> 07:04.027
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

07:04.029 --> 07:05.695
You know,
let me do a little tonight,

07:05.697 --> 07:07.363
and I'll catch up
with you guys later.

07:07.365 --> 07:09.699
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

07:11.536 --> 07:13.503
So, um, now that
Penny's not coming...

07:13.505 --> 07:15.755
We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Okay.

07:23.298 --> 07:25.281
Hold on. Pause.

07:25.283 --> 07:27.467
Something doesn't make sense.
Look...

07:29.054 --> 07:31.688
In 2015, Biff steals
the sports almanac

07:31.690 --> 07:33.640
and takes the time machine

07:33.642 --> 07:37.477
back to 1955, to give it
to his younger self.

07:37.479 --> 07:40.647
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future,

07:40.649 --> 07:42.982
so the 2015 he
returns to would be

07:42.984 --> 07:47.070
a different 2015, not the 2015
that Marty and Doc were in.

07:47.072 --> 07:50.089
This is <i> Hot Tub Time Machine</i>
all over again.

07:53.161 --> 07:55.411
If future Biff
goes back to 2015

07:55.413 --> 07:57.297
right after he gives
young Biff the almanac,

07:57.299 --> 08:00.416
he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

08:00.418 --> 08:03.720
Because it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

08:03.722 --> 08:05.838
that 1955 Biff
placed his first bet.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.973
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

08:06.975 --> 08:08.725
Is “placed” right?

08:08.727 --> 08:09.642
What do you mean?

08:09.644 --> 08:11.811
Is “placed” the right tense

08:11.813 --> 08:14.013
for something that would have
happened in the future

08:14.015 --> 08:17.100
of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

08:17.102 --> 08:21.070
Had will have placed?

08:21.072 --> 08:23.606
That's my boy.

08:24.776 --> 08:28.661
Okay, so, it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

08:28.663 --> 08:30.697
that Biff had will have
placed his first bet

08:30.699 --> 08:32.115
and made his millions.

08:32.116 --> 08:34.250
That's when
he altered the timeline.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.969
Yeah, but he had will
haven't placed it!

08:38.256 --> 08:41.457
What?!

08:41.458 --> 08:43.458
Unlike <i> Hot Tub Time Machine,</i>

08:43.461 --> 08:45.545
this couldn't be more simple.

08:45.547 --> 08:47.547
When Biff gets the almanac
in 1955,

08:47.549 --> 08:49.966
the alternate future
he creates isn't the one

08:49.968 --> 08:52.852
in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine

08:52.854 --> 08:54.187
to travel to 2015.

08:54.189 --> 08:55.138
Therefore,

08:55.140 --> 08:56.606
in the new timeline,

08:56.608 --> 08:58.608
Marty and Doc never brought
the time machine...

08:58.610 --> 08:59.692
W-Wait.

08:59.694 --> 09:01.277
Is “brought” right?

09:05.166 --> 09:09.635
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought?

09:10.488 --> 09:12.789
I don't know.
You did it to me.

09:12.791 --> 09:15.375
Oh, I'm going with it.

09:15.377 --> 09:18.161
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought

09:18.163 --> 09:20.463
the time machine to 2015.

09:20.465 --> 09:23.049
That means 2015 Biff could also

09:23.051 --> 09:27.003
not had have had brought
the almanac to 1955 Biff.

09:27.005 --> 09:31.674
Therefore, the timeline in which
1955 Biff gets the almanac

09:31.676 --> 09:33.176
is also the timeline

09:33.178 --> 09:36.012
in which 1955 Biff
<i>never</i> gets the almanac.

09:36.014 --> 09:37.847
And not just “never gets.”

09:37.849 --> 09:41.834
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

09:46.891 --> 09:48.124
He's right.

09:50.028 --> 09:52.912
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

09:52.914 --> 09:55.481
Sounds like when you pop open
a can of Pillsbury dough.

09:55.483 --> 09:58.084
Biff.

09:59.587 --> 10:02.672
Oh, that stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

10:02.674 --> 10:03.623
Guys...

10:03.625 --> 10:04.841
Do you know that
the word “wiener”

10:04.843 --> 10:06.042
comes from the German name

10:06.044 --> 10:07.376
of the Austrian capital
Vienna, or “Wien”?

10:07.378 --> 10:09.712
Do you know if you look
at Austria on a map

10:09.714 --> 10:11.130
it actually looks like a wiener?

10:12.600 --> 10:13.800
Guys, what are
we doing?

10:13.802 --> 10:14.967
W-We sent the girls away

10:14.969 --> 10:16.185
so we could focus.

10:16.187 --> 10:19.305
I don't think it worked.

10:34.708 --> 10:38.944
Maybe after this, you'll be
in the mood for some Manilow.

10:38.946 --> 10:42.030
I think after this,
I'll be dead.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.065
Look at us out,

10:44.067 --> 10:45.951
while Penny's in
the room studying.

10:45.953 --> 10:47.202
I'm proud of her.

10:47.204 --> 10:48.336
This is a great opportunity.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.205
It's nice to see her take it
seriously.

10:50.207 --> 10:51.207
It is.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.208
But enough about Penny.

10:52.209 --> 10:54.009
Let's talk about us.

10:54.011 --> 10:56.344
We're looking good.

10:56.346 --> 10:58.430
We are...

10:58.432 --> 11:00.098
Better than good.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.518
I mean, look at you.
Your body's bangin'!

11:03.520 --> 11:05.303
Amy!

11:05.305 --> 11:06.638
Don't “Amy” me.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.639
We're always talking
about how hot Penny is.

11:07.641 --> 11:09.975
Come on-- scientist
to scientist,

11:09.977 --> 11:13.645
how big are those
Hadron Colliders?

11:15.482 --> 11:17.899
You're embarrassing me.

11:17.901 --> 11:18.984
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

11:18.986 --> 11:21.319
I'll show you the divot
in my spine.

11:21.321 --> 11:21.930
What?

11:21.954 --> 11:23.873
No, no, it's okay.
I was born with it.

11:23.874 --> 11:26.074
If you put a double-A
battery in there,

11:26.076 --> 11:28.960
it makes my leg kick.

11:31.131 --> 11:32.163
All right.

11:32.165 --> 11:34.416
Oh, this is already better.
There are

11:34.418 --> 11:36.801
far fewer distractions in here.

11:36.803 --> 11:37.919
Plus, this is where our minds

11:37.921 --> 11:39.220
are conditioned
to focus on work.

11:39.222 --> 11:40.922
So, I've been thinking
about the hover boards,

11:40.924 --> 11:43.641
and maybe there's a way
we could use Maglev technology.

11:43.643 --> 11:46.344
Or if we could figure out a
way to supercool the materials,

11:46.346 --> 11:47.979
we could utilize
quantum coupling.

11:47.981 --> 11:50.148
Well, I wonder
if anyone's tried that.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.649
Go online and look it up.

11:51.651 --> 11:53.234
Oh, I can't argue with him.

11:53.236 --> 11:54.686
It's right there on the screen.

11:54.688 --> 11:58.239
Austria does look like a wiener.

11:59.276 --> 12:00.408
That's nothing, dude.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.560
Go check out
how hung Florida is.

12:04.664 --> 12:06.781
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's
walking funny.

12:06.783 --> 12:08.199
Can we get back to work?

12:09.453 --> 12:10.952
Yeah... he's right.

12:10.954 --> 12:13.171
Oh, here's a thought.

12:13.173 --> 12:16.624
What if we use some form of
operant conditioning techniques

12:16.626 --> 12:18.593
to keep us from
getting off topic?

12:18.595 --> 12:20.462
Like behavior modification?

12:20.464 --> 12:21.513
Yeah, exactly.

12:21.515 --> 12:22.781
Did you know

12:22.783 --> 12:25.216
those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons

12:25.218 --> 12:26.768
to play ping-pong?

12:26.770 --> 12:28.803
That cannot be true.

12:38.648 --> 12:41.649
Hey, it was match point.

12:42.486 --> 12:44.202
Some psychologists

12:44.204 --> 12:46.154
perform operant conditioning
with punishment.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.622
Maybe we can come up
with a punishment

12:47.624 --> 12:49.491
for straying off topic.

12:49.493 --> 12:54.245
Not getting to see who wins at
pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

12:54.247 --> 12:56.414
We could snap a rubber
band on our wrists

12:56.416 --> 12:58.383
every time we
get sidetracked.

12:58.385 --> 13:01.836
Mmm, not bad.
You know, in medieval times,

13:01.838 --> 13:04.005
idle chatter was punished
with a device called

13:04.007 --> 13:05.673
the scold's bridle.

13:05.675 --> 13:07.258
It's an iron cage

13:07.260 --> 13:11.346
that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

13:11.348 --> 13:14.549
If only we had one.

13:15.619 --> 13:17.819
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

13:23.143 --> 13:25.493
Housekeeping!

13:27.330 --> 13:28.947
We had a complaint

13:28.949 --> 13:32.467
about somebody pooping
on a party in there!

13:34.888 --> 13:37.539
It was us the whole time!

13:38.675 --> 13:40.542
Why'd you tell her?
It was working.

13:40.544 --> 13:42.010
Was it working?

13:42.012 --> 13:44.429
Yeah.

13:44.431 --> 13:47.182
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:47.184 --> 13:50.051
You guys look
like you're having fun.

13:50.053 --> 13:51.553
We're having
the best time.

13:51.555 --> 13:56.057
Guess who won $100
playing craps.

13:56.059 --> 13:57.559
That's a dollar.

13:57.561 --> 14:01.146
Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

14:01.148 --> 14:03.615
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

14:03.617 --> 14:06.951
We found a place that has
Australian male strippers.

14:06.953 --> 14:08.069
We want to see

14:08.071 --> 14:10.405
if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.750
That sounds so great.

14:22.752 --> 14:25.253
But I have
a little more studying to do.

14:25.255 --> 14:28.056
Can you
believe this nerd?

14:29.092 --> 14:31.926
Come on, do you want to
sit here being a loser,

14:31.928 --> 14:33.094
or do you want to watch me climb

14:33.096 --> 14:34.596
into an Australian man's
G-string

14:34.598 --> 14:36.764
like a baby kangaroo?

14:42.105 --> 14:45.240
All right, guys, look,
I would love to go out,

14:45.242 --> 14:46.774
but I've got
to get this done, okay?

14:46.776 --> 14:48.943
So have fun at the club.
And if you get

14:48.945 --> 14:50.445
in trouble, find a policeman.

14:50.447 --> 14:52.280
And if he's taking off
his pants,

14:52.282 --> 14:54.666
he is not a real policeman.

14:54.668 --> 14:58.203
Okay, okay, this is obviously
very important to her.

14:58.205 --> 15:01.372
Let's just, we'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

15:01.374 --> 15:03.091
Here...
here, I'm gonna quiz you.

15:03.093 --> 15:05.760
I'm gonna quiz you.

15:05.762 --> 15:08.129
I got your notes!

15:08.131 --> 15:09.347
I got your notes!

15:09.349 --> 15:11.266
I got your notes!
If you want these,

15:11.268 --> 15:14.369
they're gonna be
at the strip club!

15:15.855 --> 15:17.805
Aren't you gonna chase her?

15:17.807 --> 15:20.108
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

15:27.817 --> 15:29.150
Okay, so we agree,

15:29.152 --> 15:30.485
whenever someone
takes us off topic

15:30.487 --> 15:33.788
they get their arm
hair yanked off.

15:33.790 --> 15:34.906
And I really
can't let that happen

15:34.908 --> 15:36.291
or the girl who does
my eyebrows will think

15:36.293 --> 15:37.792
I've been cheating on her.

15:38.828 --> 15:42.330
All right, now, one benefit
of quantum coupling...

15:42.332 --> 15:43.715
Wait, no, question:

15:43.717 --> 15:45.750
who decides if someone's
gone off topic?

15:45.752 --> 15:48.336
I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.054
Oh, and also...

15:50.056 --> 15:52.674
Ow!

15:52.676 --> 15:54.759
W-We didn't vote!

15:54.761 --> 15:56.928
We didn't have to--
that was clearly a tangent.

15:56.930 --> 15:58.596
Now come on.
Back to work.

15:58.598 --> 16:00.481
If we're leaning towards
quantum coupling...

16:00.483 --> 16:02.600
Aah! Why?

16:02.602 --> 16:04.319
You said
“quantum coupling.”

16:04.321 --> 16:06.521
That made me think
of the show <i> Quantum Leap.</i>

16:06.523 --> 16:08.213
That's a tangent
and it's your fault.

16:08.213 --> 16:09.602
That's ridiculous.

16:09.626 --> 16:11.626
Sheldon, I vote that
is not a tangent.

16:12.078 --> 16:13.695
Thank you.
And now I owe you one.

16:13.697 --> 16:15.780
Ow!

16:15.782 --> 16:17.532
That was your fault.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.083
Hey!

16:19.085 --> 16:21.336
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.588
Ow!

16:23.590 --> 16:27.008
And now I'm gonna hear it
from Jenny.

16:27.010 --> 16:29.010
Everyone stop.

16:29.012 --> 16:30.261
This was a stupid idea.

16:30.263 --> 16:32.547
Negative reinforcement
isn't working.

16:32.549 --> 16:34.382
I think you mean
positive punishment.

16:34.384 --> 16:37.835
Negative reinforcement is the
removal of a positive stimulus.

16:37.837 --> 16:39.220
It's a common mistake.

16:39.222 --> 16:41.472
Negative reinforcement
is really wrong?

16:41.474 --> 16:43.224
Oh, it's used incorrectly
all the time.

16:43.226 --> 16:45.026
Even Bill Murray
makes that mistake

16:45.028 --> 16:47.045
in the first scene
of <i> Ghostbusters.</i>

16:47.047 --> 16:50.682
No way. Not Bill Murray.

16:50.684 --> 16:53.234
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement

16:53.236 --> 16:55.153
on ESP ability.

16:55.155 --> 16:56.237
Huh.

16:56.239 --> 16:59.407
Bill Murray did get it wrong.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.209
Jump ahead to the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

17:01.211 --> 17:02.910
No!

17:02.912 --> 17:04.878
Leonard's right.

17:04.881 --> 17:06.414
We can't just jump ahead.

17:06.415 --> 17:09.083
We have to watch the whole movie.
Look.

17:09.085 --> 17:11.219
We keep procrastinating.

17:11.221 --> 17:13.054
We saw <i> Back to the Future II,</i>

17:13.056 --> 17:14.204
pigeons playing
ping-pong,

17:14.207 --> 17:15.757
a bunch of countries
that look like genitals

17:15.759 --> 17:18.760
and one guy whose genitals
look like Denmark!

17:19.929 --> 17:22.829
Yeah, sorry for
clicking on that.

17:24.651 --> 17:26.401
It's late.
We've wasted hours.

17:26.403 --> 17:28.185
Can we please find it
in ourselves

17:28.188 --> 17:29.987
to do any amount of work
tonight?

17:29.989 --> 17:33.574
But we didn't see them bust
one ghost.

17:35.078 --> 17:37.745
So y-you're saying
we should stand here

17:37.747 --> 17:39.580
in my lab on a
Saturday night

17:39.582 --> 17:40.782
and watch the rest
of <i> Ghostbusters</i>

17:40.784 --> 17:42.450
on a crappy laptop?

17:42.452 --> 17:43.918
No.

17:54.064 --> 17:56.431
It really does hold up.

18:05.225 --> 18:08.643
See? Isn't this better
than a hotel room?

18:08.645 --> 18:11.646
Yep. Shake that thing!

18:11.648 --> 18:15.933
Have you ever seen a body
so fine?

18:15.935 --> 18:18.619
We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class,

18:18.621 --> 18:21.122
but none of them
moved like that!

18:35.968 --> 18:38.505
Good morning.

18:38.506 --> 18:40.139
You want to go
to the pool?

18:42.510 --> 18:45.511
Come on...
you said it yourself.

18:45.513 --> 18:48.380
Only nerds and losers
stay in the room.

18:48.382 --> 18:51.633
Oh! Oh!
Oh!

18:51.635 --> 18:53.352
Wow, it's bright out.

18:53.354 --> 18:56.021
Isn't it bright? I should
probably close these curtains.

18:56.023 --> 18:57.639
Nah. Bye!

18:58.726 --> 19:01.593
Would you please close
the drapes?

19:01.595 --> 19:02.895
Okay.
