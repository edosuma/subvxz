PRESENT, FEBRUARY 2019

00:59.059 --> 01:02.270
<i>It's been two years</i>
<i>since you've been gone.</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:06.107
<i>It's already 2019 here.</i>

01:10.653 --> 01:12.989
<i>Ohri Ramen is no longer trendy.</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:20.121
<i>Ryu Sun-kwang really did become</i>
<i>the president.</i>

01:21.539 --> 01:26.127
<i>I saw the Im Yo-hwan game</i>
<i>with Se-young and Ki-doong.</i>

01:26.211 --> 01:29.339
-Im Yo-hwan wins.
-We have to watch to know.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.758
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:32.717 --> 01:33.968
Im Yo-hwan does win.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.554
What the heck!

01:38.098 --> 01:40.809
Well, Alpha Craft will win.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.520
-What?
-Im Yo-hwan will win.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.480
Stop it, you two.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.400
-So, who's going to win?
-Just watch and you'll know.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.362
<i>I knew who'd win, so it wasn't fun.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:56.157
<i>All the future items you bought for me</i>

01:56.407 --> 01:59.369
<i>are now all things of the past.</i>

02:00.912 --> 02:04.666
<i>I'm worried that our time together</i>
<i>will become a thing of the past.</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:06.751
<i>So, I feel a little lonely lately.</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:12.423
<i>From your wife, Ma-rin.</i>
<i>February, 2019.</i>

02:17.512 --> 02:20.265
SCHEDULE SEND
ON FEBRUARY 11, 2022

02:27.188 --> 02:29.899
FUTURE, FEBRUARY 2022

02:45.748 --> 02:48.209
<i>Where am I?</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:50.837
<i>It's my house.</i>

02:56.676 --> 02:57.677
Are you awake?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.099
Can you see me?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.481
<i>Where is Ma-rin?</i>

03:12.233 --> 03:13.943
<i>This must be a dream.</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:20.033
Hello.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.786
What's going on with So-joon?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.623
I think it was a temporary condition
this time, too.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.499
The doctor is with him right now.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.794
You said he woke up.
He opened his eyes and moved his fingers.

03:31.878 --> 03:36.132
-He's been doing that often.
-Doesn't that mean he's recovering?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.179
Oh, hello.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.561
It seems to have been
a temporary myoclonic twitch.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.314
That is what caused the physical movement.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.524
It can happen.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.196
He hasn't moved at all for two years,
but it's beenÂ four times this month.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.781
Is this a common thing?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.866
It is a unique case.

04:02.742 --> 04:08.081
I don't know
why Chairman Yu ended up this way.

04:08.623 --> 04:12.001
He has no damage to his brain.
Everything is normal.

04:13.461 --> 04:17.799
When he was first found in the subway,
he was bleeding severely.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.053
He was not under cardiac arrest or shock.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.724
I don't know why he would be in a coma.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.362
Give it to me.

04:47.912 --> 04:48.955
Strictly speaking,

04:49.706 --> 04:52.875
So-joon doesn't belong here, you know.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.588
He should be in the past,
but he's been here too long.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.675
I know he should wake up.

05:01.884 --> 05:06.514
But, sometimes I think it might be better
for So-joon to be asleep.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.768
How will he deal with reality
once he wakes up?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.563
If he learns
what happened to Ma-rin...

05:15.982 --> 05:18.276
Isn't the anniversary of Ma-rin's death
next month?

05:18.651 --> 05:19.569
I think so.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.655
Ah, it's already been three years.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.245
There's hope for So-joon, right?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
Of course there is.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.042
No matter how hard,
he should wake up.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.794
He should go back home or live here.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.006
So-joon needs to live his life.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.717
Yeah, he should.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.011
Let's go.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.744
He's doing it again.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.289
It's twice today.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.887
Are you awake?

06:29.555 --> 06:30.556
Yu So-joon.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.811
So-joon, it's me. Are you awake?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.605
Ki-doong.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.361
What year is it now?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.532
Can you really see me?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.326
You can really talk, and hear me?

06:51.786 --> 06:55.581
I asked you what year it is.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.962
It's the year... 2022.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.315
<i>This stop is Namyeong Station.</i>
<i>The door is on the right...</i>

07:21.399 --> 07:24.444
FUTURE
ONE MONTH LATER, MARCH 2022

07:24.527 --> 07:26.404
<i>One month has passed since I woke up.</i>

07:27.738 --> 07:30.700
<i>And I failed again today.</i>

07:34.245 --> 07:35.872
<i>I don't know why.</i>

07:36.497 --> 07:39.500
<i>But, I can't return to my time.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:45.590
November 30, 2019.

07:46.924 --> 07:47.842
So...

07:50.511 --> 07:52.680
after you got stabbed by Kim Yong-jin,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.558
you showed up three years later.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.060
You were passed out in the subway.

08:00.104 --> 08:05.109
I skipped the last day, didn't I?

08:05.860 --> 08:06.903
Last day?

08:09.822 --> 08:14.285
Since then, I have never been conscious.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.915
You're saying I've been in bed
for two years, like this.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.416
Yeah.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.168
How did you know?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.337
While I've been here...

08:25.338 --> 08:28.049
I could hear things every now and then.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.010
I thought they were dreams.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.096
Oh, right.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.224
It's late, but congratulations.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.727
You got married to Se-young.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.066
Yeah, you really did hear everything.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.694
I was so shocked.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.784
Then, by any chance...

08:57.578 --> 08:59.455
did you hear about Ma-rin too?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.625
Why aren't you asking about Ma-rin?

09:06.045 --> 09:09.090
Let's not talk about that.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.190
<i>Ma-rin met her fate as expected.</i>

09:28.025 --> 09:30.653
<i>Ma-rin is not here.</i>

09:31.112 --> 09:32.863
<i>I survived by myself again.</i>

09:34.156 --> 09:35.116
<i>Thankfully...</i>

09:36.033 --> 09:39.954
<i>if I go back to my time,</i>
<i>I can still see Ma-rin.</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:43.624
<i>The problem is that I can't go back.</i>

09:46.085 --> 09:50.298
<i>Ma-rin only has a few days left now.</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:54.176
I'm sure it's straight.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.012
Why does it look crooked?

09:58.639 --> 10:00.891
It looks straight
when I look at it like this?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.230
So-ri.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.900
I think my eyes are weird.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.448
Straight things look crooked.
Crooked things look straight.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.618
What a mystery.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.538
Hey, this is the true mystery.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.666
No, I don't want to hear about it.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.919
Time travelers must really exist.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.671
This is so crazy.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.882
-Time traveler?
-Yeah.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.344
-There's a time traveler somewhere?
-It's really big news.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.721
I usually don't believe in things
like this.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.432
You can't explain it
unless there are time travelers.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.602
Is there a picture? Man or woman?

10:44.977 --> 10:47.146
Probably a woman. Her nickname is Flower.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.440
Flower?

10:49.982 --> 10:53.152
She used the ID "Flower"
and put up predictions here and there.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.196
It's one hundred percent correct.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.157
Big fires, earthquakes, tsunami...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.242
She predicts all of these things.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.750
<i>Hello. I am BJ Hwang.</i>
<i>Thank you for tuning in today.</i>

11:07.833 --> 11:11.170
<i>I see there are many comments</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

11:11.879 --> 11:14.548
<i>Everyone, have you heard of Flower?</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:19.178
She's like a living Nostradamus.
Possessed by the spirits.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.765
She is already famous on the internet.

11:22.890 --> 11:27.937
It's my belief
that Flower is a time traveler.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.855
That is my claim.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.442
Why is Secretary Hwang doing this?

11:34.443 --> 11:35.486
You know him?

11:37.113 --> 11:37.988
Yeah.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.117
Why would you watch these childish things?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.868
You should watch it too.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.870
It's all coincidence.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.914
All the dates are correct, too.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.418
December 21, she said to be careful
of electric blankets in a fire.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.377
She wrote that.

11:52.002 --> 11:55.673
An entire apartment went up in fire
because of an electric blanket.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.591
I'm sure it's all just fake.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.721
They were going crazy,
they couldn't find the Janghan killer.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.473
Flower wrote a comment with his name.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.725
She wrote where he lives.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.728
When they caught him,
it turned out to be true.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.355
She predicted
who the president would be.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.774
Everything I've said so far...

12:13.899 --> 12:16.318
one could just say,
"Is she possessed by a spirit?"

12:17.194 --> 12:19.530
This is the biggest piece of evidence.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.782
What now?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.492
You know Ohri Ramen?

12:24.618 --> 12:25.870
It was popular for a while.

12:26.162 --> 12:30.499
A year before it had been released,
she put a picture of it online.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.170
The only way to explain that
is she brought it from the future.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.050
People who find that stuff out
have skills.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.721
The comments were left all over the place
so how were they found?

12:44.221 --> 12:47.099
She hasn't been commenting lately.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.935
People are saying Flower is in the future.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.105
They're asking for lottery numbers
and college entrance exams.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.733
People are just making wishes
and going nuts.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.193
Just get to work.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.986
How ridiculous.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.071
You shouldn't ignore Flower.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.990
She's on a different level.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.369
She must be flustered.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.585
It's getting so many hits.
I'll be catching up to Psy.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.547
The strength of Flower.
You're doing great.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.886
-You're here.
-Yes. Good morning.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.888
You're in very late today.

13:26.096 --> 13:30.017
I had a late night yesterday.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.186
With who?

13:32.311 --> 13:34.730
You didn't get
our business partners to pay, did you?

13:34.855 --> 13:37.650
I paid for it myself, okay? I paid.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.736
You didn't lobby with your own money,
did you?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.280
I was out with an old friend from school.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.574
You look very tired in the morning.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.159
Oh, the nagging!

13:47.243 --> 13:51.038
Hey, I have a meeting,
so just get out and do your thing.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.248
I'll be in that meeting.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.584
Is there something
I can't hear in this meeting?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.839
You and your suspicions. Hey!

14:00.214 --> 14:03.467
I, Wang Jong-chul, am
the Interim President of this company.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.929
Must I always hear lectures from you
and receive suspicion?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.139
You are always nagging away.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.307
Director, Director.

14:10.474 --> 14:15.020
It is my duty to say these things
in order to make<i> </i>you walk the right path.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.188
Hey!

14:16.272 --> 14:19.567
Please get over the trauma
you had with Kim Yong-jin.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.277
Why are you taking it out on me?

14:21.443 --> 14:24.113
-Go get some counseling.
-Pleaseâ¦

14:24.238 --> 14:26.115
-Don't bring up his name.
-What?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.200
Don't say that name. I just..

14:28.284 --> 14:30.077
-Yeah.
-It hurts me. Hold on.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.996
-Don't you--
-Is it because of Yong-jin?

14:32.079 --> 14:34.915
-Don't say it. If you say his name...
-What...

14:34.999 --> 14:36.584
Yong-jin is still bothering you!

14:36.667 --> 14:37.960
-Right?
-Oh, I can't breathe.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.504
-I told you not to say his name.
-Oh, don't faint.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.135
I'm going insane.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.679
I didn't know this was going on.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.100
What do I do?
What if people take me away?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.607
<i>Ma-rin, what are you doing?</i>

15:01.483 --> 15:04.153
-There will be an apartment fire.
-Really?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.405
-Let's tell people.
-We can't.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.242
Electric blankets...

15:10.326 --> 15:12.328
What are you thinking?

15:12.703 --> 15:15.080
Don't write these things.
Who would believe you?

15:15.331 --> 15:19.376
Once the fire happens,
they could come after you for arson.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.586
Then what will you do?

15:21.879 --> 15:25.925
Still, how can I pretend not to know?
The whole building is going to burn down.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.968
Don't worry about others.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.471
You said you want to focus on ourselves
and live well.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.932
We can just use anonymous IDs.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.516
No, you can't.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.311
There's no end to it
if you get involved in people's lives.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.064
-Give it to me.
-No, you can't.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.649
-Give it back.
-No.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.739
This isÂ pretty steamy.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.747
What are you looking at?

16:01.335 --> 16:04.672
It must have been hard
to ignore things all by yourself.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.133
You have such a soft heart.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.804
I'm really strong.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.516
You had all the world's secrets.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.437
He must've been so frustrated.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.691
What are you doing? You're heavy.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.360
I'm listening.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.904
Yes.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.907
Oh, yes. You can tell me.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.368
Oh, is that right?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.121
Oh no.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.123
I didn't know that.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.208
What did he say?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.629
He said he was sometimes sad and lonely.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.174
What else?

16:50.175 --> 16:53.512
Oh, I see. That's how it was.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.347
What did he say?

16:56.223 --> 16:57.850
Now, he's okay because I'm here.

16:59.059 --> 17:02.062
What now? He sure talks a lot.

17:02.813 --> 17:06.316
Oh, I see. Yes.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.278
He says to never let him go.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.741
He is very clingy, just like Song Ma-rin.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.952
What else now? I just need to stay here.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.787
You say you love me?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.165
You are right about that.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.642
-I can't believe it.
-Why is there so much?

17:43.103 --> 17:46.607
People keep calling me Nostradamus.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.778
How much do you think
I was dying to mention I did this?

17:50.861 --> 17:53.614
I know exactly how you feel.
You can't tell anyone.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.200
-You can't tell.
-It's so incredibly frustrating.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.993
You could've told me.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.536
<i>-</i>How could you not?
-I couldn't.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.039
So-joon should be here to see this.

18:10.297 --> 18:14.551
If he knew I put all this up,
he would've lectured me so much.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.264
Well, I don't know anything
more about the future.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.850
I can't cause more trouble
even if I want to.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.437
Gosh, seriously.

18:26.146 --> 18:30.025
All the people on the internet are
looking to Flower right now.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.070
I can't tell them
that I have nothing to show.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.323
-It's pretty hopeless.
-It really is.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.076
How do you feel
about your exhibition?

18:39.159 --> 18:40.536
Are you nervous?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.288
I feel good.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.541
Oh, the arrogance.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.876
-I guess I am arrogant.
-Oh...

18:50.587 --> 18:52.756
Honestly, it makes me think a lot
about So-joon.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.096
I'm wondering
if it's okay for me to be happy on my own.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.517
I want to be congratulated by So-joon.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.270
So-joon would have been happy
to know.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.523
I feel very restless.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.317
Oh, restless.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.736
We should drink to that.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.113
What is this?

19:16.822 --> 19:21.285
Anyway, I'm so happy being here
with you guys.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.369
Oh, it's nothing.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.954
Cheers. Thank you so much.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.206
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.797
This beer is good.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.842
Oh, that was good.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.886
-We said we would pay.
-No, it's okay.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.637
-The bill seemed large.
-It's fine.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.805
Gosh...

19:41.889 --> 19:43.640
-We had too much.
-We'll take you home.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.559
No. You should get going.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.060
No, we'll take you.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.231
Thank you for today.
It was really so much fun.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.984
-Good luck with the preparations.
-Hurry back home.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.611
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.529
Get home safely. Good luck.

20:53.085 --> 20:53.961
How much?

20:54.461 --> 20:55.712
8,800 won.

20:56.046 --> 20:56.922
I'll pay.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.258
-It's okay.
-I'll pay.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.343
-It's fine.
-You always pay for me.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.012
-I'll pay.
-You have such a great heart.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.640
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.070
This stop is Namyeong Station.

21:20.153 --> 21:23.240
<i>Please. Please.</i>

21:45.595 --> 21:47.431
Flower is home.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.099
Come here.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.984
Follow me. Come here.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.409
Come here.

22:21.715 --> 22:22.632
Come here.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.730
I just can't seem to go.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.693
Even if I go now,
it's the day after tomorrow.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.196
That will be the end.

22:52.120 --> 22:52.996
So-joon.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.249
I know I shouldn't be saying this.

22:59.669 --> 23:03.298
Can't you accept it as fate
and adjust to living here?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.803
What if you go back and can't save Ma-rin?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.764
How will you handle that and carry on?

23:15.769 --> 23:18.814
Could you do that if it were Se-young?

23:23.985 --> 23:24.820
I'm sorry.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.117
There are only two days left.

23:31.201 --> 23:34.371
After two days, I won't ever be able to
see her ever again.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.168
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.671
Until the very end...

23:44.464 --> 23:45.966
she must've been so lonely.

23:50.011 --> 23:50.887
Yeah.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.598
She did say she thought about you a lot.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.226
She had her first photo exhibition then.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.606
Is it because of my poor health?

24:02.399 --> 24:05.944
Or... is it because
I've been here too long--

24:06.027 --> 24:08.029
It's not something
you can do anything about.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.784
Then should I just live here by myself?

24:13.910 --> 24:15.412
My home is back there.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.999
I should be where Ma-rin is.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.587
If I could be with her for even one hour,
no...

24:25.547 --> 24:27.674
If I could see her for even ten minutes...

24:29.593 --> 24:31.303
I'd do anything to return.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.434
Where should I send it to today?

25:21.353 --> 25:24.773
One year later or two years later?

25:28.109 --> 25:28.944
Okay.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.864
Today, I'll send it to three years later.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.044
NEW MAIL

26:02.060 --> 26:03.603
<i>Are you dead or alive?</i>

26:05.105 --> 26:06.398
<i>I'm a little drunk.</i>

26:08.441 --> 26:10.193
<i>Are you cheating on me in the future?</i>

26:11.069 --> 26:12.696
<i>Otherwise, why can't you come back?</i>

26:14.239 --> 26:16.950
<i>You're cheating on me</i>
<i>with a futuristic woman, aren't you?</i>

26:17.867 --> 26:22.122
<i>You said you wanted to see the fireworks</i>
<i>on March 25, 2019.</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.250
<i>That's the day after tomorrow.</i>

26:26.876 --> 26:28.837
<i>You better come back</i>
<i>before I get angry.</i>

26:29.796 --> 26:31.506
<i>We need to go see the fireworks.</i>

26:32.799 --> 26:35.885
<i>P.S. Do you like it there that much?</i>

26:37.137 --> 26:40.223
<i>Why? Do the cars fly in the sky?</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:12.756
I REALLY MISS YOU

27:37.113 --> 27:38.365
FROM SONG MA-RIN

27:38.448 --> 27:41.326
ALL THE FUTURE ITEMS
YOU BOUGHT FOR ME ARE NOW...

27:50.627 --> 27:51.503
DEAR FUTURE SO-JOON

27:51.586 --> 27:58.051
HI, I JUST READ YOUR LETTER YOU SENT
FROM THE BEACH.

27:58.426 --> 28:03.014
FROM YOUR WIFE, MA-RIN. JANUARY, 2017

28:19.989 --> 28:23.451
<i>Nothing much has changed in 2022.</i>

28:25.412 --> 28:27.497
<i>I still can't reach out and touch the sky.</i>

28:29.416 --> 28:32.460
<i>People end up becoming dust, in the end.</i>

28:35.964 --> 28:37.966
SONG MA-RIN

28:41.553 --> 28:44.681
<i>It's not vastly different than</i>
<i>where I'm from.</i>

28:46.891 --> 28:48.685
<i>I feel so out of place here.</i>

28:50.145 --> 28:51.980
<i>I don't think I can live here alone.</i>

29:16.588 --> 29:22.135
SONG DOO-IL

29:22.260 --> 29:27.015
SONG MA-RIN PHOTO EXHIBITION
THE TIME WHERE WE USED TO BE

29:39.736 --> 29:41.029
Why isn't anyone here?

29:41.946 --> 29:43.323
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.784
I sent so many invitations.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.789
-Did they get sent to the wrong address?
-Why are you nervous?

29:51.289 --> 29:52.791
You just opened.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.586
-Is it raining?
-No.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.547
Then why aren't people coming?

29:59.964 --> 30:01.674
I don't see any of my friends.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.135
Ma-rin.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.599
Am I not allowed to come in?

30:10.266 --> 30:11.851
You can come in.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.437
It's been a long time.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.147
Yes, it has been.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.983
I noticed you won a rookie award.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.739
It was just a small newspaper.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.366
I was one of the judges.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.913
I wanted to make sure a photographer
I chose was deserving of the award.

30:31.996 --> 30:32.956
That's why I came.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.961
Ah, back then...

30:38.628 --> 30:40.630
I don't remember
how many years ago that was.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.259
It was the day Chairman Yu
brought you to my studio.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.552
Do you remember?

30:46.427 --> 30:47.720
Ah, yes.

30:48.888 --> 30:52.225
I wasn't accepting you
because of any connections.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.478
It was because
your pictures were really good.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.773
Do you still have
that inferiority complex?

31:01.776 --> 31:02.735
I didn't know.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.197
I did get too excited and go overboard.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.409
But, in the end...

31:10.910 --> 31:12.787
I think it's good
you didn't work with me.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.541
You must have met many good people.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.378
You're my first guest today.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.380
Really?

31:23.339 --> 31:24.257
I'm honored.

31:24.966 --> 31:25.800
Pardon?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.136
Nevermind if you didn't hear me.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.347
Aren't you going to say hello?

31:31.973 --> 31:34.475
I guess you didn't see. I said hello.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.400
-Welcome.
-Hello.

31:43.067 --> 31:43.943
Manager Cheon.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.906
-What took you so long?
-There was so much traffic.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.325
Take a look at this.
It's Photographer Song's work.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.662
-I knew how talented she is.
-Gosh!

31:54.746 --> 31:56.164
What a work of art.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.044
Hello.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.672
How have you been?

32:06.382 --> 32:08.885
-Se-young.
-Oh, hello!

32:09.177 --> 32:11.554
-This is my wife.
-Hello.

32:11.638 --> 32:12.972
-Isn't she pretty?
-Yes.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.724
-So-ri!
-Ma-rin is over there.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.268
-Oh, Ma-rin!
-Ma-rin.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.978
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations.

32:19.062 --> 32:19.896
Thank you!

32:19.979 --> 32:21.898
-We're here!
-Hey, Ma-rin!

32:21.981 --> 32:24.901
-You're really something.
-It's really great.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.403
-Congratulations!
-You're really a photographer.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.905
You took good photos.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.115
They're better than I thought they'd be.

32:31.574 --> 32:32.867
I'm a good photographer.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.498
They look great.

There's construction going on.
You can't come in.

33:46.232 --> 33:49.819
I have some stuff to do.
Can I just come in?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.362
The subway is not running.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.700
I need to go home.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.201
What?

33:57.785 --> 33:59.370
Can I go in just for a moment?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.122
Are you an official?

34:01.539 --> 34:03.708
No, that's not it.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.212
I just have something important to do.
If I don't go now...

34:09.088 --> 34:10.089
-What?
-I...

34:11.257 --> 34:14.135
I'll give you everything I have.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.887
What? Just get out.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.097
-Wait, Mister.
-Get out.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.724
Help me out here.

34:19.807 --> 34:20.808
What's going on?*

34:20.892 --> 34:23.478
Nothing's going to happen
just because I go in.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.354
-You need to get out.
-Wait.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.023
I'll be in and leave quickly.

34:27.106 --> 34:30.109
-Just leave.
-I have to go in there.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.694
-Please leave.
-I really need...

34:31.778 --> 34:33.863
-I really have to go.
-Mister, please get out.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.115
Gosh, seriously!

34:36.199 --> 34:38.493
Hey, catch him!

34:38.743 --> 34:40.078
Get back here. Stop!

34:49.629 --> 34:51.214
Get back here. Stop!

34:51.297 --> 34:52.340
Stop!

<i>I'd do anything to return.</i>

35:06.938 --> 35:08.064
Don't leave.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.736
I'm sorry.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.582

<i>I'm scared.</i>

35:30.044 --> 35:31.003
<i>Don't leave.</i>

35:32.463 --> 35:33.840
The thing you can't tell me...

35:35.424 --> 35:37.593
<i>it's something</i>
<i>I should be worried about?</i>

35:37.677 --> 35:39.387
FROM YOUR WIFE, MA-RIN.
JANUARY, 2017

35:39.470 --> 35:40.847
DEAR FUTURE SO-JOON

35:54.235 --> 35:55.444
Stop right there!

35:55.778 --> 35:56.612
What's going on?

35:57.363 --> 35:58.698
Where did he go?

35:59.740 --> 36:00.825
Where did he go?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.706
-What happened?
-What?

36:08.332 --> 36:09.417
Where did he come from?

36:11.711 --> 36:12.962
THE NEXT STOP IS NAMYEONG

36:13.963 --> 36:15.047
What's going on?

36:47.872 --> 36:48.706
Song Ma-rin!

37:06.557 --> 37:07.475
I'm sorry.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.360
Ma-rin.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.118
You're So-joon from the past, aren't you?

37:29.705 --> 37:32.708
I don't want to see you. Please leave.

37:39.131 --> 37:42.385
Even if I go back into the past,
I wouldn't break up with you.

37:43.886 --> 37:47.014
Even if I die,
I would never regret meeting you.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.978
Do you know how much I suffered
because you lied for my sake?

37:52.270 --> 37:54.438
I thought our relationship
was going to get bad.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.943
You asked the past me
to break up with you.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.445
Then you ask the future me to come back.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.656
That's something you'd do.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.293
Who are you?

38:16.043 --> 38:19.547
Why would you be so foolish
and send over a hundred emails?

38:24.635 --> 38:26.929
I'm not cheating on you
with a girl in the future.

38:29.098 --> 38:32.893
I received the email you sent yesterday,
three years in the future.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.813
You told me to come back quickly.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.737
What took you so long?

38:47.408 --> 38:48.826
I'm sorry for taking so long.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.668
I waited so long for you.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.838
I waited so long.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.593
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.429
I'm sorry, Ma-rin.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.684
<i>I'm back. No phone calls.</i>

40:37.601 --> 40:39.228
<i>Will call you soon.</i>

40:43.816 --> 40:44.900
He came back.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.116
You'll keep working?

40:52.825 --> 40:55.286
Just one more hour. You should go first.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.414
Doesn't your husband say anything
if you work late?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.917
My Doong gives me massages every day
because I work hard.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.503
He cooks for me, and cleans too.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.297
He even carries me to the bathroom.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.423
My Doong?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.343
-Can you not say those things?
-Why not?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.471
-Isn't it cute?
-It's not cute.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.055
I shouldn't have brought it up.

41:16.891 --> 41:20.102
I'll get going since I have no one to give
me massages or cook for me.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.479
-Bye.
-Okay.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.278
Se-young! Honey! Se-young,...

41:29.487 --> 41:31.238
-Oh!
-Oh, hello.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.157
You should get going, sexy guy.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.494
-Se-young!
-Did you come to pick me up?

41:40.039 --> 41:40.956
What is it?

41:43.834 --> 41:44.960
So-joon is back.

41:46.754 --> 41:47.838
-What?
-Hey...

41:48.464 --> 41:50.174
I even got a text from him.

41:50.257 --> 41:51.217
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.845
So, even his number is the same.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.347
I was going to call him.

41:56.430 --> 41:59.767
But I think he's with Ma-rin
and I don't want to interrupt.

42:00.267 --> 42:02.353
You should have called.
Why did you come here?

42:02.436 --> 42:04.813
We have to share the good news.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.108
I am so relieved.Â I'm so happy.

42:08.984 --> 42:11.612
Hey, don't cry though. I'll get jealous.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.868
I have one more thing.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.203
What is it?

42:19.286 --> 42:21.580
It's not much,
so don't get too disappointed.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.043
<i>2, 7, 14.</i>

42:26.168 --> 42:27.836
<i>10, 20, 26.</i>

42:28.128 --> 42:31.507
<i>These are the winning lottery numbers</i>
<i>for the second week of March in 2022.</i>

42:31.632 --> 42:32.675
<i>Your wedding gift.</i>

42:33.842 --> 42:34.927
Awesome.

42:37.763 --> 42:38.889
It's been a long time.

42:39.348 --> 42:42.560
-Have you been doing well?
-I have.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.897
I run a coffee shop on Jeju Island.

42:47.481 --> 42:49.525
-Living with nature.
-Oh...

42:49.692 --> 42:50.651
You know what I mean?

42:51.527 --> 42:54.321
I only came up because of
Ma-rin's photography exhibition.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.365
That sounds very cool.

42:57.157 --> 43:01.537
I'm trying to let go of everything.
Iâve been healing within nature.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.666
I still have nightmares, though.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.377
How about you, Secretary Hwang?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.170
Do you have nightmares?

43:10.504 --> 43:14.049
I'm still not in a good state.
I can't go out at night.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.969
It was a dream of mine
to become a celebrity.

43:17.052 --> 43:20.431
I've started doing an internet broadcast
as a hobby, and that has helped.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.183
-I knew about that.
-What?

43:23.767 --> 43:25.227
I even recommended and liked it.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.063
Oh, gosh. You did?

43:28.522 --> 43:30.899
Did you see it?

43:32.484 --> 43:33.777
Would you like my autograph?

43:34.236 --> 43:35.654
No, I don't need that.

43:36.822 --> 43:39.783
-I saw your episode on Flower.
-Yes.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.577
Do you know anything else?

43:42.202 --> 43:44.413
I really want to meet her.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.416
I only know about her from the internet.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.128
Flower is the mystery of this age.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.677
My future just seems so bleak.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.514
Come on.Â Cheer up.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.060
You are still young.

44:07.436 --> 44:12.066
If I look at you closely like this,
I can see...

44:12.775 --> 44:16.612
your charm. Your strength.
No, your charm.

44:16.862 --> 44:17.821
I can see your charm.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.157
"Ma'am"? That was ages ago.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.204
Anyway, thank you.

44:26.789 --> 44:31.085
I'm sorry and grateful about the past too.
That's how I feel.

44:32.586 --> 44:35.464
I thought about you often
when things were hard.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.592
I must have depended on you a lot.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.889
Even in the future...

44:44.556 --> 44:46.058
you can call me

44:47.351 --> 44:48.519
if you have difficulties.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.940
Can I do that?

44:55.109 --> 44:55.943
Yes.

44:56.944 --> 44:57.903
Okay.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.116
For two years?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.828
What about now? Are you okay now?

45:06.620 --> 45:08.288
Yes, I'm fine.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.459
Was I a good nurse?

45:16.338 --> 45:17.214
Of course.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.468
Then...

45:23.053 --> 45:26.974
you must've had to break up with me
in the other world.

45:27.599 --> 45:29.727
I'm back where I belong.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.856
I'm sure the future has changed
for the better too.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.526
I like how you said you belong here.

45:39.278 --> 45:42.197
We can talk about me later.
Tell me about you.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.032
How have you been?

45:46.660 --> 45:50.414
I opened my first photo exhibition today.

45:52.082 --> 45:52.916
I know that.

45:53.333 --> 45:57.546
I even won a rookie award
from a small newspaper.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.630
Really?

45:59.089 --> 46:01.425
That's great. That's very cool.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.473
I've been doing well.

46:09.808 --> 46:10.976
It wasn't that hard.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.440
That's not true.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.570
It was kind of hard.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.531
Suddenly, I can't remember it at all.

46:25.783 --> 46:26.867
Because I'm so happy.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.876
-Let's go.
-Where?

46:40.547 --> 46:42.758
There are lots of Happiness pictures here.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.149
Isn't this a violation of rights
to my image?

47:01.109 --> 47:03.529
I didn't know I'd get caught like this.

47:04.571 --> 47:06.114
Who knew you'd come today?

47:06.573 --> 47:11.411
You really are a faithful wife.
Song Faithful Wife.

47:12.996 --> 47:16.250
Let's not call you Flower anymore.
I'll call you Song Faithful Wife.

47:18.752 --> 47:19.878
Faithful Wife.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.423
How did you endure it
when you wanted to see me so much?

47:24.299 --> 47:26.468
Did you poke yourself with a needle
every night?

47:28.804 --> 47:30.472
I had my ways.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.479
You came to me
whenever I thought I'd forget you.

47:41.233 --> 47:43.026
You came to me from the past.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.240
You sent me a video message, too.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.118
You brought me dumplings.

47:52.077 --> 47:52.995
Also...

47:54.329 --> 47:55.956
We ran into each other by chance.

47:58.792 --> 48:00.752
And when I really missed you...

48:02.838 --> 48:04.506
I went looking for you.

48:31.116 --> 48:33.076
<i>I went to places you went to often.</i>

48:34.244 --> 48:35.245
<i>In front of the house.</i>

48:38.790 --> 48:40.167
<i>In front of Ki-doong's house.</i>

48:42.628 --> 48:46.423
<i>Also, the Seoul Station subway train</i>
<i>you took from the past.</i>

48:50.928 --> 48:52.429
<i>If I went looking for you...</i>

48:54.056 --> 48:57.726
<i>I would be lucky enough to see you</i>
<i>every now and then.</i>

49:00.771 --> 49:02.439
Oh, Ma-rin.

49:03.690 --> 49:05.025
What brings you here?

49:06.777 --> 49:10.572
You're not the Yu So-joon that I know,
are you?

49:14.409 --> 49:15.869
You're from the past.

49:17.788 --> 49:21.208
You found out everything.

49:22.459 --> 49:23.543
I know everything.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.380
I know you're a time traveler.

49:27.923 --> 49:28.757
Yeah.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.385
You must've been shocked.

49:34.388 --> 49:35.931
You're being very cold to me.

49:37.182 --> 49:41.019
<i>When I did run into you,</i>
<i>all I could do was act like that.</i>

49:43.480 --> 49:44.648
Then, that day...

49:46.316 --> 49:48.777
-...were you there looking for me?
-Of course.

49:50.278 --> 49:52.239
Why else would I be there?

49:53.115 --> 49:55.117
Ki-doong moved
and didn't live there anymore.

50:12.551 --> 50:14.177
Goodbye.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.763
Oh, the flowers smell great.

50:17.472 --> 50:19.057
I feel like a young girl.

50:19.975 --> 50:20.809
Let's go.

50:21.393 --> 50:23.937
I must be a woman, after all.
I just love flowers.

50:24.521 --> 50:25.564
Men like flowers too.

50:27.149 --> 50:27.983
So, how is it?

50:28.775 --> 50:31.153
How does it feel
to go to your daughter's exhibition?

50:32.404 --> 50:33.321
Good, I suppose.

50:33.905 --> 50:35.032
But why the long face?

50:35.115 --> 50:37.075
DAY OF ACCIDENT, MARCH 2019

50:37.242 --> 50:39.036
I'm just happy.

50:40.078 --> 50:43.498
We're going as a couple today.
Let's link arms.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.125
I don't want to.

50:45.709 --> 50:49.171
My goodness, I'm trying to open up here.

50:49.588 --> 50:50.672
You don't need to.

50:52.174 --> 50:54.468
You want to get back together
with me, right?

50:55.177 --> 50:56.928
You do, don't you?

51:00.140 --> 51:01.475
Aren't you sick of me yet?

51:01.975 --> 51:03.393
My goodness.

51:04.019 --> 51:07.105
You must feel too ashamed.
It's because I'm too good for you, right?

51:07.939 --> 51:08.899
Goodness.

51:13.945 --> 51:15.697
You're too good for me, it won't work.

51:18.325 --> 51:23.080
If I knew it would be like this,
I should've been better.

51:24.664 --> 51:27.334
I don't know why I was curious
about everything back then.

51:27.417 --> 51:30.003
Everything in the world seemed so fun.

51:31.421 --> 51:33.006
Is that why you left us?

51:36.426 --> 51:37.594
I must have been crazy.

51:39.471 --> 51:41.556
Here. I'll hold onto your arm.

51:41.932 --> 51:42.766
Let's go.

51:43.725 --> 51:45.477
What are you doing? Oh my!

51:46.603 --> 51:48.730
-Why such a small bouquet?
-It's big enough.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.148
If it's too big--

51:50.607 --> 51:52.567
-You took really great photos.
-I know.

51:54.903 --> 51:57.072
-Mom.
-My son!

51:57.864 --> 51:58.865
Oh, son!

52:01.118 --> 52:03.411
I'm sorry I couldn't call.

52:03.495 --> 52:08.208
I heard you were in the US.
I didn't see you at all for two years.

52:08.458 --> 52:10.502
You know how large the US is.

52:10.919 --> 52:13.046
Do you know how worried I was?

52:13.171 --> 52:16.091
I wondered if your relationship was bad
or if something happened.

52:16.299 --> 52:18.343
Why didn't you ever call?

52:18.426 --> 52:20.887
Mom. So-joon's not feeling well.

52:21.054 --> 52:22.722
Let's go talk.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.937
-I'm going to go talk to him.
-Okay.

52:32.190 --> 52:33.024
Hey.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.610
How does your dad--

52:35.694 --> 52:37.863
Mom, let's look at the photos.

52:37.946 --> 52:41.074
Look at these here,
and the ones downstairs too.

52:46.496 --> 52:48.748
Why would you be so stupid
and come back here?

52:48.874 --> 52:50.709
You should have stayed there and lived.

52:50.792 --> 52:53.461
That's enough. Don't waste your breath.

52:55.547 --> 52:57.966
Today, Mister...

52:59.759 --> 53:03.054
I shouldn't call you Mister anymore.

53:03.305 --> 53:04.139
Forget it.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.766
Once Mister, forever Mister...

53:07.767 --> 53:09.352
What am I saying?

53:11.730 --> 53:14.149
It's your last day today, too.

53:17.527 --> 53:20.906
The Namyeong Station accident
ten years ago.

53:22.949 --> 53:24.868
I heard that you were there too.

53:26.119 --> 53:27.370
Ma-rin told me.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.290
Then you too...

53:31.791 --> 53:33.793
-will face the same fate as us.
-No, I don't.

53:34.794 --> 53:36.046
I live for three more days.

53:36.838 --> 53:40.842
You could say that I suffer
for three more days.

53:42.677 --> 53:44.387
We should stop talking about this.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.848
If you think about it...

53:48.391 --> 53:53.146
No oneÂ in the world knows
what's going to happen today.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.652
Ever since I could travel to the future...

54:00.528 --> 54:03.198
I have never not worried about my future.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.576
Now that today has come...

54:08.328 --> 54:09.663
I feel strangely at peace.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.332
How should I put it?

54:13.750 --> 54:15.085
I didn't really give up.

54:17.128 --> 54:19.005
It doesn't make any sense at all.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.218
But I feel I've done enough.

54:24.552 --> 54:26.221
It's a feeling similar to that.

54:27.847 --> 54:31.935
Maybe it's more like
I don't have any thoughts at all.

54:34.104 --> 54:35.188
That's how I feel.

54:37.148 --> 54:38.483
I can't put it into words.

54:38.733 --> 54:41.486
Still, you can't give up hope.

54:41.903 --> 54:45.991
Of course, I won't.
We'll go watch the fireworks tonight.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.867
I have so much more to do.

54:48.743 --> 54:49.577
Yes.

54:51.037 --> 54:53.248
Things will really end once you give up.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.876
I'm not giving up.

54:58.003 --> 54:58.962
For this one day...

55:01.298 --> 55:03.717
I want to spend it being truly happy.

55:07.387 --> 55:08.221
Okay.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.559
Have you been getting along well
with Ma-rin?

55:14.769 --> 55:17.314
Well, we're still awkward
around each other.

55:18.773 --> 55:20.317
Why bother getting attached?

55:22.193 --> 55:24.321
That's why you never showed yourself
to Ma-rin.

55:24.863 --> 55:26.489
And protected her from the shadows.

55:27.365 --> 55:28.658
I'm not a good dad.

55:29.492 --> 55:31.911
I don't want to make her
lose her father twice.

55:33.413 --> 55:37.584
If we can get past this,
I'll be a really good dad to her.

55:43.923 --> 55:47.510
Do you remember what I said?

55:49.846 --> 55:51.431
That I have a daughter.

55:52.432 --> 55:56.311
I said she met a good man
and they were living a lovey-dovey life.

55:56.728 --> 56:01.107
Then you threatened me, saying
I would die if IÂ didn't marry Ma-rin.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.653
It was just what I hoped for.

56:08.073 --> 56:11.409
To tell you the truth,
I knew that you could foresee the future.

56:11.701 --> 56:15.997
I was only thinking about
how to save Ma-rin.

56:17.999 --> 56:19.376
I manipulated you.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.296
Also...

56:24.714 --> 56:27.842
I thought
you two would suit each other well.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.429
Whether you lived one or ten years,

56:31.513 --> 56:34.641
I thought
you would be happier living together.

56:36.518 --> 56:39.687
But, I don't know
if I did the right thing or not.

56:45.860 --> 56:49.531
Thank you for letting me meet Ma-rin.

56:52.617 --> 56:53.785
If I see you tomorrow,

56:55.620 --> 56:56.830
I will call you Father.

56:59.707 --> 57:00.542
Okay.

57:03.461 --> 57:06.131
Good luck... father.

57:07.966 --> 57:09.467
Do it tomorrow.

57:10.009 --> 57:13.471
Why would you change your mind
after one second?

57:13.680 --> 57:14.889
Start tomorrow.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.599
So-joon.

57:17.350 --> 57:18.184
-Yeah.
-Gosh.

57:18.768 --> 57:21.062
I got scared for a second
thinking you disappeared.

57:25.900 --> 57:27.318
Should I give you two a moment?

57:27.444 --> 57:29.529
-No, no.
-We're done talking.

57:29.612 --> 57:30.864
We're finished.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.617
We have somewhere we have to go today.

57:34.909 --> 57:37.829
-Can I take So-joon?
-Of course. Go, go.

57:38.204 --> 57:39.539
Where are we going?

57:41.291 --> 57:42.834
Thank you for coming today.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.796
We should all have a meal together
very soon.

57:48.715 --> 57:52.385
-You should talk more with your father.
-I can't today.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.556
Let's make sure to have that meal.

57:57.348 --> 57:58.516
Sure. Okay.

57:59.684 --> 58:01.436
-I'll call you, Mister.
-Okay.

58:01.644 --> 58:02.604
Bye.

58:03.438 --> 58:05.940
There was a place I wanted to go
when you got here.

58:12.947 --> 58:14.282
They suit each other well.

58:15.950 --> 58:17.327
You two look great together!

58:19.120 --> 58:22.499
We were supposed to register our marriage
the day you went missing.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.543
Right, we were.

58:27.962 --> 58:28.880
Here it is.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.175
Birth registration,
marriage registration...

58:34.636 --> 58:35.720
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

58:35.803 --> 58:37.096
Gosh, what is this?

58:37.805 --> 58:40.099
Why did they put
the divorce form right beside it?

58:41.226 --> 58:45.355
Even if it's just for organization,
it's really so thoughtless, right?

58:46.397 --> 58:48.233
We went through so much
to come here.

58:49.317 --> 58:50.527
Shall we complain?

58:52.278 --> 58:55.448
No. We shouldn't do that
on a good day like today.

58:55.532 --> 58:56.741
Let's be positive.

58:58.952 --> 59:00.411
Okay. I'll fill mine out.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.416
Seriously, I'm so nervous.

59:06.751 --> 59:07.752
You can't write it?

59:08.127 --> 59:10.421
-I'm nervous.
-I'll write mine first.

59:16.678 --> 59:17.679
Hold on.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.766
What are you doing?
People are looking at us.

59:22.350 --> 59:24.894
It's a historical moment,
so I have to record it.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.605
You're such a typical photographer.

59:31.276 --> 59:32.569
Smile, would you?

59:32.694 --> 59:34.612
You look like
you're being forced to marry.

59:37.323 --> 59:38.324
Yu So-joon?

59:39.492 --> 59:41.953
How does it feel
to register your marriage?

59:43.788 --> 59:44.956
I am happy.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.458
You don't really seem it.

59:50.420 --> 59:51.296
I love you.

59:52.755 --> 59:53.756
Me too.

59:55.174 --> 59:56.175
Wait, wait.

59:57.218 --> 59:58.052
Here.

59:58.595 --> 1:00:00.179
-I'm giving it to him now.
-Okay.

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:02.265
-Here you go.
-Yes.

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:04.058
-Are you done?
-Yes.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:15.945
-Are you that happy?
-Yes.

1:00:17.238 --> 1:00:19.115
Brand new marriage certificate.

1:00:20.116 --> 1:00:22.201
It's really amazing.

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:26.080
This feels different than a wedding.

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:29.542
Stop staring at it. You'll wear it down.

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:34.964
Now, what will happen
when we get a family relation certificate?

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:38.801
You'll see both of our names
on the certificate.

1:00:39.427 --> 1:00:40.928
That means we'reÂ  a family now.

1:00:42.347 --> 1:00:43.264
That's so amazing.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.184
You sure find many things amazing.

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:51.189
We can't break up
unless the judge says we can.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:53.191
Gosh, I love it.

1:00:54.525 --> 1:00:56.778
You're so obsessed.

1:01:04.744 --> 1:01:05.620
-Ma-rin.
-Yeah?

1:01:05.703 --> 1:01:06.537
Look at this.

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:13.711
VISITOR BY JUNG HYUN-JONG

1:01:14.128 --> 1:01:17.590
<i>Having someone walk into your life is</i>
<i>actually an incredible thing.</i>

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:19.842
<i>That person...</i>

1:01:20.551 --> 1:01:23.096
If I die now, people will say this.

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.557
"I pity Bap-soon's life."

1:01:29.727 --> 1:01:32.480
People will make fun of me
even after I die.

1:01:32.772 --> 1:01:34.023
<i>And that person's past...</i>

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:35.733
You promised me.

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:38.319
We're going to live together.

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:39.612
<i>And the present....</i>

1:01:40.905 --> 1:01:44.701
<i>Also, that person's future comes attached.</i>

1:01:45.952 --> 1:01:48.788
<i>A person's entire life comes.</i>

1:01:49.789 --> 1:01:51.457
It totally sounds like our story.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:56.295
I guess this cafe lets its customers
leave notes like this.

1:01:56.963 --> 1:02:00.842
Let me see.
It was written by Jung Hyun-jong.

1:02:00.925 --> 1:02:04.095
-Oh, that...
-It's very well written.

1:02:04.178 --> 1:02:06.889
It's just like our story.
Shall we write something too?

1:02:07.932 --> 1:02:09.142
-Excuse me.
-Shall we?

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:10.727
We'll leave a note too.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:12.270
-Can we get one of these?
-Sure.

1:02:12.395 --> 1:02:13.312
We'll write one.

1:02:13.855 --> 1:02:16.107
That's a poem.

1:02:16.774 --> 1:02:18.109
"Visitor" by Jung Hyun-jong.

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:20.194
It's not a guestbook.

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:26.451
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1:02:28.286 --> 1:02:29.287
Where are you going?

1:02:30.913 --> 1:02:31.748
Ma-rin.

1:02:33.124 --> 1:02:36.419
I also thought
it was part of their guestbook.

1:02:36.544 --> 1:02:37.712
It was so embarrassing.

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:41.466
-Let's read some books. What is this?
-Okay.

1:02:43.801 --> 1:02:45.720
Where should we go now?

1:02:46.387 --> 1:02:48.055
We should go look at the fireworks.

1:02:49.348 --> 1:02:50.933
Yeah. Let's go.

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:57.565
Let's take the bus. I don't like subways.

1:02:58.441 --> 1:02:59.901
Yeah, it's been a while.

1:03:01.694 --> 1:03:02.945
Let me see.

1:03:03.488 --> 1:03:04.906
Where's the bus stop?

1:03:06.073 --> 1:03:07.617
I'll find it. Wait here.

1:03:08.159 --> 1:03:09.577
Ma-rin, be careful.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:12.246
Oh, I found it.

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:17.752
Sorry about that.

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:19.629
My papers.

1:04:15.893 --> 1:04:18.479
<i>I don't want to talk about it anymore.</i>

1:04:19.522 --> 1:04:21.566
<i>Like the time I was riddled with guilt</i>

1:04:21.649 --> 1:04:23.568
<i>when I lost my parents</i>
<i>at Namyeong Station,</i>

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:29.824
<i>Ma-rin and I would have to be in pain</i>
<i>over this dayÂ for many days to come.</i>

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:33.661
<i>But at the same time, we will forget...</i>

1:04:33.744 --> 1:04:34.829
THREE YEARS LATER, 2022

1:04:34.912 --> 1:04:37.748
<i>how desperate we were for this one day.</i>

1:04:38.624 --> 1:04:39.584
Realtor.

1:04:41.794 --> 1:04:43.796
-Realtor.
-What?

1:04:45.631 --> 1:04:48.259
Why are you yelling
so early in the morning?

1:04:48.926 --> 1:04:50.469
I'm getting really angry.

1:04:50.970 --> 1:04:52.179
What is it again?

1:04:52.305 --> 1:04:54.891
Gosh, it's unbelievable.

1:04:55.266 --> 1:04:58.477
Ma-rin, I told you
to take some cooking classes.

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:01.606
-We're eating toast for breakfast.
-I got the credit card statement

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:04.942
Do you know
how much the public transit cost is?

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:08.070
You've been on the subway,
haven't you?

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:11.115
Your clothes, your shoes, and your bag.

1:05:11.198 --> 1:05:13.492
They're all from the other world.

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:15.161
Don't use me as an excuse.

1:05:15.870 --> 1:05:19.874
I'm not getting pregnant
because you keep going to the other world.

1:05:20.791 --> 1:05:23.169
Why would you bring that up now?

1:05:23.878 --> 1:05:27.715
Do you think your sperm could be normal
when you keep traveling there?

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:33.596
Hey, you're being kind of harsh.

1:05:33.804 --> 1:05:35.848
What's wrong with my sperm?

1:05:36.265 --> 1:05:39.936
You even wrote a contract
saying you wouldn't go toÂ the other world.

1:05:40.519 --> 1:05:42.229
Do your promises to me not matter?

1:05:43.064 --> 1:05:45.608
I 'm disappointed
every time you break your promises.

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:47.652
But you want me to buy your stuff.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.695
-When it's for me--
-Yours and mine?

1:05:50.696 --> 1:05:52.198
Why do you say things like that?

1:05:52.281 --> 1:05:55.242
-You are so egocentric.
-You are hopeless.

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:56.661
That expression is outdated.

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:57.787
Are you mocking me?

1:05:57.870 --> 1:06:00.081
You're being too much every morning.

1:06:00.331 --> 1:06:01.916
Let me go to work in a good mood.

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:04.460
-What work do you do?
-I do work.

1:06:04.543 --> 1:06:06.504
-Have you seen me?
-I don't have to see it.

1:06:06.629 --> 1:06:09.715
-Stop mistreating me!
-Why are you yelling?

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:11.175
Did I?

1:06:14.053 --> 1:06:17.014
Don't get all angry. Don't be like that.

1:06:17.306 --> 1:06:18.516
You've changed so much.

1:06:20.518 --> 1:06:24.689
If I think about those two years
that I suffered waiting,

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:26.440
I feel so bad for myself.

1:06:26.565 --> 1:06:29.360
I'm running late, so I have to go.

1:06:30.361 --> 1:06:32.822
You made this mess
and you're going to leave?

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:36.367
-I have to work to make a living for us.
-Go!

1:06:37.868 --> 1:06:38.744
Go...

1:06:43.290 --> 1:06:44.625
I'm going to work.

1:06:45.209 --> 1:06:46.585
I'm not running away.

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:55.511
What did I do so wrong?

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.388
Why does she always mistreat me?

1:07:01.684 --> 1:07:03.436

<i>Every now and then...</i>

1:07:20.619 --> 1:07:23.164

<i>It's from the time</i>
<i>when every second was precious.</i>

1:07:56.447 --> 1:07:57.281

1:07:59.283 --> 1:08:00.242
I am sorry.
