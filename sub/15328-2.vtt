00:01.876 --> 00:04.254
- James!
Set the table!

00:04.337 --> 00:08.591
- JAMES: On it!
Aaron, set the table!

00:08.675 --> 00:10.677
- On it!

00:10.760 --> 00:13.221
- Okay, what'd I miss
and how'd I miss it?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.223
- I lost to James in
rock, paper, scissors.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.767
Now I have to do
his chores and mine.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.978
- When I tell you boys
to take out the trash,

00:20.061 --> 00:21.980
I don't mean take it
out of the can

00:22.063 --> 00:23.982
and leave it in
the middle of the floor.

00:24.065 --> 00:27.360
James, take out the trash--
all the way!

00:27.444 --> 00:28.945
- JAMES: On it!

00:29.028 --> 00:31.114
Aaron, take out the trash--
all the way!

00:31.197 --> 00:32.991
- On it!

00:33.074 --> 00:34.659
- Do you wanna watch
something before dinner?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.619
- Charlie, don't you wonder
why you asked one kid

00:36.703 --> 00:38.621
and the other kid's
doing it?

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
- I know why.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.250
They play rock, paper,
scissors for chores.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.793
- And James always wins.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.795
- That's because Aaron
hasn't figured out

00:45.879 --> 00:47.714
that when you play
rock, paper, scissors,

00:47.797 --> 00:50.800
you shouldn't always throw
it in exactly that same order.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.010
- And we're just
gonna let James

00:52.093 --> 00:54.262
keep taking advantage
of Aaron.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.014
- It's what brothers do.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.725
As long as no one's holding
someone's head in the toilet,

00:58.808 --> 01:01.519
we stay out of it.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.857
Even then, give them a minute.
It might be consensual.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.152
- The good news is--I got
the trash bag to the curb.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.403
- Thanks, buddy.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.821
- Hang on.

01:11.905 --> 01:16.576
The bag made it to the curb,
but the trash did not.

01:16.659 --> 01:21.331
It made it as far as
all over your car.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.874
- Aaron!

01:22.957 --> 01:25.168
Well, thank goodness James
is washing my car tomorrow.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.838
- Oh, can I just
do a regular wash?

01:28.922 --> 01:33.092
A detail takes forever.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.761
- He makes you wash
my car, too?

01:34.844 --> 01:38.890
- Stephanie, rock, paper,
scissors is a powerful thing.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.726
- All right, buddy,
here's a little tip.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.563
When you play James
in rock, paper, scissors,

01:45.647 --> 01:48.024
don't always go rock,
then paper, then scissors.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.568
- But that's the name of it.
- [laughing]

01:50.652 --> 01:53.196
The thing is he knows
what you're gonna do.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.365
And now that you know
what he's gonna do,

01:55.448 --> 01:58.159
you can go scissors,
then rock, then paper,

01:58.243 --> 02:00.119
and then you'll win.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.413
- Scissors, then rock,
then paper?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.499
- Mm-hm.
- I do wanna win.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.501
I can't do manual labor.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.922
I'm trying to save these
babies for hand modeling.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.800
- Hey, Aaron, am I done
setting the table?

02:13.883 --> 02:15.552
- Oh, not yet.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.763
Do you wanna rock, paper,
scissors for setting the table

02:18.847 --> 02:20.431
and a whole nother
week of chores?

02:20.515 --> 02:24.227
- You're on.
Just let me warm up.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.312
Ah...

02:26.396 --> 02:28.565
[grunting]

02:31.234 --> 02:32.443
[grunting]

02:32.527 --> 02:35.071
Okay, let's go.
Best two out of three.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.781
- BOTH: Ready, set, shoot!

02:36.865 --> 02:38.700
- [gasping]
Scissors cut paper!

02:38.783 --> 02:42.203
- Wait? What? You won?

02:42.287 --> 02:46.249
- That's weird.
I never win.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.960
- Yeah, it was weird.
Let's go again.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.712
- BOTH: Ready, set, shoot!

02:50.795 --> 02:53.590
- Rock smashes scissors!

02:53.673 --> 02:56.009
You wanna play a third--
just 'cause?

02:56.092 --> 02:57.510
- BOTH: Ready, set, shoot!

02:57.594 --> 03:00.179
- Paper covers rock!

03:02.807 --> 03:05.560
- Yeah, let's...
best three outta five.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.395
- I hate to break it to ya,

03:07.478 --> 03:10.273
but I already won
three outta five.

{\an8}- Hey, James, do you
remember that time

03:42.931 --> 03:44.599
{\an8}when my rock smashed
your scissors

03:44.682 --> 03:47.060
{\an8}into a million,
billion tiny pieces?

03:47.143 --> 03:50.438
{\an8}- Yes, that was
five minutes ago.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.231
{\an8}- Hey, James, do you
remember that time

03:52.315 --> 03:53.900
{\an8}my scissors cut your paper

03:53.983 --> 03:58.321
{\an8}into a million,
billion tiny pieces?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.865
{\an8}- It rings a bell, yes.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.076
{\an8}- Hey, James, do you
remember that time--

04:03.159 --> 04:05.620
{\an8}- No, tell me, and go
slow so I can take notes.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.956
{\an8}- I don't think you're being
sincere now, James.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.502
{\an8}- Aaron beat James
at something?

04:12.585 --> 04:15.797
{\an8}That happened conveniently close
to when we talked about it.

04:15.880 --> 04:20.468
{\an8}- No, no, I intervened.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.220
{\an8}- Yeah, I got that part.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.638
{\an8}I wanna know why.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.556
{\an8}- I was tired of seeing Aaron
get stepped on by James.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.183
{\an8}- He's the little brother.

04:27.266 --> 04:28.685
{\an8}Gettin' stepped
on is his job.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.103
{\an8}- Charlie, that's ridiculous.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.604
{\an8}I mean, if he keeps on losing,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.481
{\an8}he's just gonna end up
resenting his brother.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.776
{\an8}- Resentment is one of
nature's great motivators.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.861
{\an8}I wouldn't be a doctor today
if I didn't hate my brother

04:38.945 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}for always kickin' my butt
at that operating game.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.576
{\an8}Who's steady now, Louis?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.412
{\an8}- That's insane, Charlie.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.705
{\an8}- It's not insane.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.748
{\an8}It's the natural
order of things.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.500
{\an8}Older brother beats younger.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.127
Father beats son.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.921
That's why I don't let James
beat me when we play chess.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.549
Some day, he'll win.
No day soon.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.385
But, when he does,
he'll know that he earned it.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.137
- Oh, I thought you
didn't let him win

05:04.220 --> 05:06.472
so you could do your
little victory dance.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.682
- I do like the part where

05:07.765 --> 05:10.727
I put him in a headlock
and give him a little polish.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.438
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:13.521 --> 05:14.397
- Hi, Mom.
Want something to eat?

05:14.480 --> 05:18.401
- Oh, that would be great.
I'm starvin'.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.737
- Too bad. There's no
food for you here.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.531
- [laughing]

05:23.614 --> 05:26.451
Well, I was just tryin'
to be polite.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.954
Don't nobody want
your nasty food.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.497
- Are you guys still
at each other's throats

05:31.581 --> 05:33.082
because of that jacket thing?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.586
- If by "jacket thing"
you mean Stephanie borrowing

05:36.669 --> 05:41.466
my best white brocade jacket
and draggin' the sleeve

05:41.549 --> 05:45.636
through some
church-basement lasagna?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.306
- Only because you shoved
me out of the way

05:48.389 --> 05:51.684
when sister Reynolds brought
out her shrimp toast.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
- It's her specialty dish.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.439
If you don't get one--
you don't get one.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.693
- I told you I would get
your stupid jacket cleaned.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.153
- Yeah, but you wanted to
take it to the cheap place--

06:02.236 --> 06:06.282
the one that uses
the dirty water.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.159
- They don't use dirty water.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.078
They don't use water.
It's dry cleaning.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.913
- They also don't
wash their hands.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.833
- Pffft! That's crazy.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.169
- Oh. [laughs]
So now I'm crazy.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.128
- Oh, nobody said "now".

06:19.212 --> 06:22.006
- Oh!
- Can you believe her?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.925
- What I can't believe
is that this

06:24.008 --> 06:24.884
has been going on for a week.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.345
It's just a jacket.

06:27.428 --> 06:31.849
- If by "just a jacket,"
you mean a white brocade sleeve

06:31.933 --> 06:36.562
that she dragged through
church lasagna.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.939
- Only because you shoved me

06:38.022 --> 06:40.691
trying to get to sister
Reynold's shrimp toast!

06:40.775 --> 06:45.947
- We were just there.
I am on Satan's merry-go-round.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.783
Look, you apologize.
- Hm!

06:48.866 --> 06:51.244
- And you take it.
- [huffs]

06:51.327 --> 06:53.996
- Way to support me,
Charlie.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.039
- And don't be tellin'
me to just take it!

06:55.123 --> 06:58.167
Now give it!
[grunting]

07:01.796 --> 07:02.630
- [door slams]

07:02.713 --> 07:05.341
- Are they gone?
- Where have you been?

07:05.424 --> 07:06.884
- Hiding in the garage.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.761
I know better than to get
in the middle of that mess.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.097
They both keep trying
to get me to take sides.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.723
- Yeah, what if you get
stuck with one of 'em?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.684
- Then I just let them
talk, keep texting my friends,

07:14.767 --> 07:18.437
and make the occasional
noise so they'll think I care.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.021
- That's a good way
to tune 'em out.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.690
I'll have to try that.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.527
Hey, uh, you wouldn't do that
to your old man, would ya,

07:24.610 --> 07:27.238
'cause you and I,
we get each other, right?

07:27.321 --> 07:29.490
- Mm-hm.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.701
- That's my girl.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.997
- Make way for
the undefeated champion.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.415
- You beat me once.

07:37.498 --> 07:43.045
- I'm one-for-one.
That makes me undefeated.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.298
I'm gonna go upstairs,
look in the mirror,

07:45.381 --> 07:48.426
and say, "Aaron,
you're da man!"

07:48.509 --> 07:50.970
Then I'm gonna look right
back at myself and say,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.890
"Don't I know it!"

07:56.350 --> 07:57.935
- How did Aaron beat you?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.729
You've got a half
a foot on him.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.314
- I don't know.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.858
The garage light was like
all up in my face and...

08:03.941 --> 08:05.818
there was this cricket
and it just kept chirping

08:05.902 --> 08:07.945
and chirping and chirping.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.115
- Hm, it seems like that cricket
should have known better

08:11.199 --> 08:14.452
than to intervene and throw
James' game off.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.704
- [groans]
It was only one game.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.289
James is still James.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.708
- Of course, I am.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.671
- Son, why is your hand
on my wallet?

08:25.755 --> 08:26.881
- You can feel that?

08:26.964 --> 08:29.967
- Feel it, yes.
Explain it, not so much.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.886
- Well, you see, I was
trying to steal your money--

08:31.969 --> 08:33.679
Oh, did I just say that?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.014
First, I can't even
pick his pocket

08:35.097 --> 08:35.890
and now I'm confessing
that I take

08:35.972 --> 08:39.769
little advances on
my inheritance?

08:39.852 --> 08:40.394
- You do what?

08:40.477 --> 08:42.605
- What's happening to me?

08:42.688 --> 08:47.068
- ♪

08:47.151 --> 08:50.071
- We have got to talk
about Stephanie.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.657
- [groaning]

08:52.740 --> 08:53.824
- Can you believe her?

08:53.908 --> 08:57.161
- Mm-hm.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.456
- Mad at me because
she ruined my jacket.

09:00.539 --> 09:01.374
- Word. Mm-hm.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.919
- I've got a lotta
words for Stephanie.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.838
- Run and tell that.
- Don't run too fast.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.007
You might slam into
someone's lasagna.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.676
- [huffs]

09:11.759 --> 09:14.720
You know, I don't have to
stand here and take this.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.432
I am going to remove myself
from this location

09:18.516 --> 09:24.230
and find a place where
people are not stank!

09:26.857 --> 09:28.526
- Stephanie, where are
my mustard-colored pants?

09:28.609 --> 09:31.904
- Uh, sweetie, they're
right there on top.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.572
- This is mustard?

09:33.656 --> 09:35.658
Has it always been this bright?
I can't pull this color off!

09:35.741 --> 09:37.702
I don't look good
in any of these clothes!

09:37.785 --> 09:39.787
Why'd you let me
buy these clothes?!

09:39.870 --> 09:42.707
- James, just calm down.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.625
Where is this coming from?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.871
I guess he's the man
of the house now.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.122
I'll go dig a hole out
in the back pasture.

20:07.205 --> 20:12.294
Promise me you'll
try to love again.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.546
- Charlie, this who
beats who nonsense

20:14.630 --> 20:15.756
is all in your head.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.466
- No, it is not.
The natural order is very clear.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.637
A man is only a man as long as
he can still defeat his son.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.139
- Hey, guys.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.767
- But it doesn't
say which son.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.770
Hey, Aaron, would
you like to play some chess?
