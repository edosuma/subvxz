WEBVTT

00:02.126 --> 00:03.268
- It's so nice to be back.

00:03.368 --> 00:05.189
It is a little cramped, but...

00:05.289 --> 00:06.791
[chuckles]
It is home.

00:06.891 --> 00:08.872
- Kelvin, stop being
everywhere I am!

00:08.972 --> 00:10.554
- You stop being
everywhere I am!

00:10.654 --> 00:12.516
- Oh, my gosh,
you're so annoying!

00:12.616 --> 00:13.677
Just move!
- Whatever.

00:13.777 --> 00:15.718
- Yeah, no one missed
having brunch here.

00:15.818 --> 00:16.679
- Ah!
- Ah!

00:16.779 --> 00:17.840
- Ah, sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:17.940 --> 00:20.683
Ah, I'm just a little on edge
because it's Halloween.

00:20.783 --> 00:21.764
- Oh, right.

00:21.864 --> 00:24.046
You're still waiting
for Connor to prank you?

00:24.146 --> 00:25.927
- The old Scare-a-Sarah.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.168
- Yeah, every freakin' year,

00:27.268 --> 00:29.731
even though it's not funny
anymore, Connor.

00:29.831 --> 00:32.053
- [evil laugh]

00:32.153 --> 00:33.094
- Ah!
- Ah!

00:33.194 --> 00:35.796
- [laughs]
- Ugh, Connor!

00:36.436 --> 00:37.457
Stop it!
Ah!

00:37.557 --> 00:39.699
Connor!
- [laughs]

00:39.799 --> 00:41.181
[mechanical laughter]
- Ah!

00:41.281 --> 00:43.343
Connor!
- [evil laugh]

00:43.443 --> 00:44.544
- Every year.

00:44.644 --> 00:47.466
I wish I had a little sister.

00:47.566 --> 00:50.549
Even though this year...
[chuckles]

00:50.649 --> 00:54.032
The scarer becomes the scaree.

00:54.132 --> 00:54.712
[laughs]

00:54.812 --> 00:56.234
Look at that.
Look how good that is.

00:56.334 --> 00:57.395
- That looks real.
- Right?

00:57.495 --> 00:59.276
- Just one normal holiday.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.038
- Well, if it's
any consolation,

01:01.138 --> 01:02.559
I'm a little on edge, too.

01:02.659 --> 01:03.720
I got a book reading tonight,

01:03.820 --> 01:05.322
and I don't think
anyone's going to show up.

01:05.422 --> 01:07.564
- Aw.
That's no consolation, no.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.726
- Tom, you wanted a reading
at Bayside Books,

01:09.826 --> 01:11.527
I got you a reading
at Bayside Books.

01:11.627 --> 01:12.688
- Yeah, but not on Halloween.

01:12.788 --> 01:14.770
Everyone's going to be
too busy to go to some reading.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.732
- OK, well, that was
the only time slot they had.

01:16.832 --> 01:19.214
- Yes, again,
because Halloween.

01:19.314 --> 01:21.656
- I think it's going
to be great, Daddy.

01:21.756 --> 01:22.697
- Oh, thank you.

01:22.797 --> 01:24.659
- Do the kids have to go too?

01:24.759 --> 01:25.579
- No, don't worry.

01:25.679 --> 01:27.221
You're going
trick-or-treating with Lupe.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.302
- [whispering]
Yes!

01:28.402 --> 01:29.383
- I can hear all of that.

01:29.483 --> 01:30.664
- And people might show up.

01:30.764 --> 01:32.185
Tom has fans.

01:32.285 --> 01:34.387
He--he has one fan.

01:34.487 --> 01:36.949
- Good ol' HappyHarmony99.

01:37.049 --> 01:37.630
- Who?

01:37.730 --> 01:39.111
- It's this woman
who's like the first

01:39.211 --> 01:40.673
to comment on every post
I do about the book,

01:40.773 --> 01:42.034
like when I linked
to the review

01:42.134 --> 01:43.395
in "The Chronicle,"
which called it

01:43.495 --> 01:45.917
a "winning and winsome
return to form."

01:46.017 --> 01:47.439
- We know.
We don't need to see it again.

01:47.539 --> 01:48.640
- Please don't read it again.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.681
- Oh, yeah, there she is,
HappyHarmony99.

01:50.781 --> 01:51.922
Wow, she loves that caps lock.

01:52.022 --> 01:54.725
- Well, she's a very
passionate person.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.006
- Tom's got a super fan.

01:56.106 --> 01:57.808
- Oh, I don't know about that.

01:57.908 --> 01:59.409
Heh.

01:59.509 --> 02:00.570
Super fan.
[chuckles]

02:00.670 --> 02:04.694
- Mom, tell Shamiah
to stop almost touching me!

02:04.794 --> 02:05.654
- Ease up, Shamiah, OK?

02:05.754 --> 02:07.576
I don't want to take away
your Halloween candy

02:07.676 --> 02:08.537
before you even get it.

02:08.637 --> 02:09.938
- Oh, Sarah,
what's that on your--

02:10.038 --> 02:10.939
- Ah!
- Ah!

02:11.039 --> 02:12.140
- Oh. Connor!

02:12.240 --> 02:13.021
- [chuckles]

02:13.121 --> 02:14.702
- Just one holiday.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.165
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

02:19.166 --> 02:19.987
[upbeat music]

02:20.087 --> 02:21.348
- ♪ Mr. Werewolf ♪

02:21.448 --> 02:23.190
♪ Mr. Werewolf ♪

02:23.290 --> 02:25.312
- Please don't kill me,
Mr. Werewolf!

02:25.412 --> 02:27.313
- [howls]

02:27.413 --> 02:27.954
- Great.

02:28.054 --> 02:29.795
Great, I was afraid
people weren't going to be

02:29.895 --> 02:31.157
taking the night seriously.

02:31.257 --> 02:34.239
- At least they're dressed
as literary characters.

02:34.339 --> 02:36.361
- But--OK.

02:36.461 --> 02:37.843
- Mr. Hayworth!

02:37.943 --> 02:38.603
Oh, sorry.

02:38.703 --> 02:40.805
Mr. Hayworth,
I'm Tod, with one D,

02:40.905 --> 02:42.447
co-manager of Bayside Books.

02:42.547 --> 02:45.129
- Oh, hey, OK.
Tom, with one M.

02:45.229 --> 02:46.170
- [laughs]
Nice.

02:46.270 --> 02:48.492
- It's actually a pretty
good turnout, tonight.

02:48.592 --> 02:50.854
Is like, another reading
letting out or something?

02:50.954 --> 02:52.455
- Tom, people love your book.

02:52.555 --> 02:53.736
Is that so hard to believe?

02:53.836 --> 02:55.778
- [whispering]
Is this an AA meeting?

02:55.878 --> 02:56.779
- Is Dean Koontz here?

02:56.879 --> 02:58.621
- No, no,
everyone is here for Tom.

02:58.721 --> 02:59.982
It should be
a pretty full house.

03:00.082 --> 03:02.464
If you'll follow me, I'll set
you up before the reading.

03:02.564 --> 03:03.825
Now, we have three
types of water--

03:03.925 --> 03:05.947
still, sparkling, and coconut.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.709
[whispering]
Go for the coconut.

03:07.809 --> 03:09.390
- OK, I'll go coconut.
[chuckles]

03:09.490 --> 03:13.053
Sparkling can be a little
too intense for me anyway.

03:13.373 --> 03:15.315
- Did you pay for people
to be here?

03:15.415 --> 03:16.356
- I did not, no.

03:16.456 --> 03:19.999
I mean, I brought money
for that exact purpose.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.522
But guess I don't need it.

03:22.622 --> 03:24.323
Now I have all this cash.

03:24.423 --> 03:25.164
You want some?

03:25.264 --> 03:26.765
- Is today actually
going to be a success?

03:26.865 --> 03:28.206
I mean, obviously,
I'm not surprised.

03:28.306 --> 03:29.768
It's just--
- Surprising, yeah.

03:29.868 --> 03:30.769
- It's so surprising.

03:30.869 --> 03:33.251
- Like seriously,
like that woman over there,

03:33.351 --> 03:34.212
she's legit attractive.

03:34.312 --> 03:38.295
And you're telling me she's
here for Tom's book reading?

03:38.395 --> 03:39.737
That doesn't make sense.

03:39.837 --> 03:40.697
- [shouts]

03:40.797 --> 03:43.520
- Hey, Sarah.
- Aw, dang it!

03:47.123 --> 03:48.264
- Nice try.
- Ah!

03:48.364 --> 03:49.225
Oh, my God.

03:49.325 --> 03:53.108
- Let the Hayworth Halloween
Fashion Show begin!

03:53.208 --> 03:54.549
So that then it can be over.

03:54.649 --> 03:57.792
First, I give you Camila,
dressed as Mirabel

03:57.892 --> 04:00.835
from the hit movie, "Encanto."

04:00.935 --> 04:02.476
Ay, que linda.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.718
Next is Gretchen as Isabela,

04:04.818 --> 04:07.120
also from the hit movie,
"Encanto."

04:07.220 --> 04:09.202
And if you're sensing a theme,

04:09.302 --> 04:11.765
I give you Kelvin as Bruno,

04:11.865 --> 04:15.728
the guy we don't talk about
from "Encanto."

04:15.828 --> 04:16.809
And finally,

04:16.909 --> 04:19.651
Shamiah as Luisa,

04:19.751 --> 04:21.953
from, you guessed it--

04:23.555 --> 04:24.496
That's not "Encanto."

04:24.596 --> 04:26.778
- Has she not seen "Encanto"?

04:26.878 --> 04:28.339
- Where's your Luisa costume?

04:28.439 --> 04:30.181
- I decided to do
something different.

04:30.281 --> 04:34.264
- KnifeEdge Nakasuke
from "Boom Boom Dojo?"

04:34.364 --> 04:34.905
Why?

04:35.005 --> 04:36.866
- Whenever I watch anime,
you say it's stupid.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.268
[doorbell rings]
- Oh.

04:38.368 --> 04:40.390
I got it, I got it.

04:40.490 --> 04:41.831
Hey, Xander.

04:41.931 --> 04:42.832
Hi, come on in.

04:42.932 --> 04:44.713
- I like your costume.

04:44.813 --> 04:45.554
- Thanks.

04:45.654 --> 04:47.356
I like yours, too. So cool.

04:47.456 --> 04:50.078
- When you told me how much
you like anime, I was psyched.

04:50.178 --> 04:52.440
- Who's this bozo?
- Hm.

04:52.540 --> 04:56.564
- Whew, that coconut water's
got a little kick.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.685
This is crazy, even though

04:57.785 --> 04:59.326
it's one of the busiest nights
of the year,

04:59.426 --> 05:01.448
folks really showed up.

05:01.548 --> 05:02.289
It's really...

05:02.389 --> 05:03.730
- Surprising.
- Gratifying.

05:03.830 --> 05:04.811
What'd you say?

05:04.911 --> 05:06.212
- That's what
I was going to say.

05:06.312 --> 05:09.615
You writers always
have the exact word.

05:09.715 --> 05:11.016
- Hi, sorry. Hi.

05:11.116 --> 05:14.860
It is so nice to meet you
in the flesh.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.460
Wow.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.622
- Oh, well, nice to meet you.
I'm Tom.

05:17.722 --> 05:19.464
- Oh, I know.
[laughs]

05:19.564 --> 05:20.865
- [laughs]
OK.

05:20.965 --> 05:23.107
You are?
- Right, sorry.

05:23.207 --> 05:24.468
Stupid. I'm Harmony.

05:24.568 --> 05:26.510
- Oh, HappyHarmony99.
- Yes!

05:26.610 --> 05:29.072
Oh, my gosh, you're like--
like, aware of me.

05:29.172 --> 05:30.033
- Oh, he really is.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.555
- Well, I'm always happy
to read your comments.

05:32.655 --> 05:36.438
- I mean, I'm happy, too,
to be here with you.

05:36.538 --> 05:37.519
Sorry, I'm really nervous.

05:37.619 --> 05:40.122
- Oh, no, come on,
don't be nervous.

05:40.222 --> 05:40.962
I'm--

05:41.062 --> 05:43.164
I'm just a writer.
[chuckles]

05:43.264 --> 05:44.606
- But you're so much more
than that.

05:44.706 --> 05:47.528
- This is my wife, Marina,
and Denise.

05:47.628 --> 05:49.210
both: Hi.
- Really nice to--

05:49.310 --> 05:52.492
- I read "Home Economics"
three times, actually.

05:52.592 --> 05:54.975
- Right.
- Because it's a revelation.

05:55.075 --> 05:55.815
- Oh, well...

05:55.915 --> 05:57.777
[chuckles]
Thank you.

05:57.877 --> 05:58.658
- Stop, thank you.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.620
'Cause it really spoke to me,
like, personally.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.301
Like every word
was, like, a puzzle piece

06:02.401 --> 06:07.466
just falling into place,
like, yes, yes, yes.

06:07.566 --> 06:08.106
[laughs]

06:08.206 --> 06:09.627
- Well, "The Chronicle"
did say that my writing

06:09.727 --> 06:12.270
"fairly dances across the
page," whatever that means.

06:12.370 --> 06:13.631
[chuckles]
- I know that you need

06:13.731 --> 06:15.553
to get ready for the reading,
but I would--

06:15.653 --> 06:20.397
is there any way we could
talk after, kind of in private?

06:20.497 --> 06:21.798
- Anything for
my number one fan.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.159
[both laugh]
- Thank you so much.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.842
OK, so I'll see you after,
and we'll talk.

06:25.942 --> 06:27.003
- Looking forward to it.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.444
- Should I have worn the hat?

06:28.544 --> 06:29.845
- No, yes, the hat's fine.

06:29.945 --> 06:31.326
- Thank you.
- It looks great, right?

06:31.426 --> 06:33.368
- It looks great.
- It looks great.

06:33.468 --> 06:36.291
- That right there,
that connection...

06:36.391 --> 06:38.613
[chuckles]
That's why you write.

06:38.713 --> 06:42.296
- Um, there's something
really wrong with her.

06:42.396 --> 06:44.218
- Yeah,
I think a bunch of things.

06:44.318 --> 06:46.460
- Come on, what,
just 'cause she likes my book,

06:46.560 --> 06:47.981
she's got to be
some kind of weirdo?

06:48.081 --> 06:49.302
Ever occur to you
that my writing

06:49.402 --> 06:50.423
might mean something to her?

06:50.523 --> 06:51.904
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
You're right.

06:52.004 --> 06:54.587
- [laughs]
OK, come on.

06:54.687 --> 06:58.790
- So do you want to go
figure out what her deal is?

06:58.890 --> 07:01.112
- Yeah, we got
15 minutes to kill.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.914
- Yeah.

07:03.014 --> 07:05.196
- So I assume you
scaring me with my own spider

07:05.296 --> 07:08.279
this morning was not
my official scare.

07:08.379 --> 07:09.079
- Maybe.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.241
Or maybe this year,
there is no scare,

07:11.341 --> 07:15.205
and the wait for the scare
is the scare itself.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.886
But no, there's definitely
a scare coming your way.

07:16.986 --> 07:19.288
- Great. I don't understand
why you keep doing this.

07:19.388 --> 07:20.850
You've been at it
since we were like 10.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.651
- Why does the caged bird sing,
Sarah?

07:22.751 --> 07:25.694
- That is not what that means.
Please let me buy you a book.

07:25.794 --> 07:29.257
- Oh, man, did you hear about
that giant crypto crash today?

07:29.357 --> 07:32.420
- Yeah, the entire market
collapsed overnight.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.021

16:03.806 --> 16:06.589
he's just trying to stay
in his big sister's life.

16:06.689 --> 16:08.470
- OK, but he's being a jerk.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.591
- OK, good talk, have fun.

16:09.691 --> 16:12.354
- No, you didn't even--
[line beeps]

16:12.454 --> 16:15.837
[soft music]

16:15.937 --> 16:16.477
- What?

16:16.577 --> 16:19.680
- Nothing, little brother.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.482
- Is this you
trying to scare me?

16:21.582 --> 16:22.442
'Cause this is working.

16:22.542 --> 16:27.287
- Good evening, and welcome
to Bayside "Boo-ks."

16:27.387 --> 16:28.207
[both laugh]

16:28.307 --> 16:29.368
Just kidding.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.530
Halloween.
I'm not actually a vampire.

16:31.630 --> 16:34.893
It is my pleasure to introduce
tonight's author,

16:34.993 --> 16:37.456
who I'm proud to call
my new friend,

16:37.556 --> 16:38.937
reading from his new novel,

16:39.037 --> 16:41.699
"Home Economics," Tom Hayworth.

16:41.799 --> 16:42.620
[applause]

16:42.720 --> 16:44.722
- Yeah!
- Bravo!

16:45.482 --> 16:46.864
- Whoo.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.986
- Thank you all for coming out.

16:49.086 --> 16:51.087
- Go, Tom!

16:52.288 --> 16:53.550
- Heh.

16:53.650 --> 16:56.312
"Chorpter" 17--
[nervous laughter]

16:56.412 --> 16:57.873
Right off the bat.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.356
[clears throat]
Obviously, chapter 17--

17:00.456 --> 17:02.678
- Shake it off.

17:02.778 --> 17:03.839
- Tim Hayward loved Halloween.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.761
When he was a kid, he'd swear
it was because of the candy.

17:06.861 --> 17:08.403
But deep down,
he loved Halloween,

17:08.503 --> 17:10.204
because it was a day
he didn't have to be himself.

17:10.304 --> 17:13.487
Tim, even as a boy, was already
trying on the heavy sweater

17:13.587 --> 17:16.049
of self-doubt that he'd come
to wear full-time

17:16.149 --> 17:18.051
as he made his way
into adulthood.

17:18.151 --> 17:19.212
The opportunity to be someone...

17:19.312 --> 17:21.214
- Wow, this is so good.

17:21.314 --> 17:23.015
- You still haven't read it?

17:23.115 --> 17:25.698
- [chuckling]
Sarah, I've read it.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.779
I just haven't, like, read it.

17:27.879 --> 17:31.022
- Hovered above the
Hayward House in 1988.

17:31.122 --> 17:32.784
Their mom and dad
hit a rough patch.

17:32.884 --> 17:35.907
Dad was finding reasons
to spend more and more time

17:36.007 --> 17:36.867
traveling for work.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.710
To Tim and Tara,
he seemed to be in Colorado

17:39.810 --> 17:41.592
more than he was at home.

17:41.692 --> 17:44.954
[shady music]

17:45.054 --> 17:47.557
Colorado--uh, sorry.

17:47.657 --> 17:49.478
For weeks at a time--
[clears throat]

17:49.578 --> 17:51.760
He was off in
a different time zone,

17:51.860 --> 17:55.003
toiling away in a research lab.

17:55.103 --> 17:56.004
- Research lab.

17:56.104 --> 17:57.285
- She said '88, right?

17:57.385 --> 17:59.207
- Uh, but he'd
call every night.

17:59.307 --> 18:00.608
Mom would pass the phone
over to the kids

18:00.708 --> 18:03.571
with barely a word, not that
he ever had much to report,

18:03.671 --> 18:06.573
just that his days
working in the lab,

18:06.673 --> 18:10.056
with a fellow scientist
named Chris,

18:10.156 --> 18:13.019
who I'd always assumed
was a man,

18:13.119 --> 18:15.741
but could just as easily
be Christine.

18:15.841 --> 18:17.022
both: Christine.

18:17.122 --> 18:20.145
- [softly]
My mom.

18:20.245 --> 18:21.907
- And the long weeks
of traveling--

18:22.007 --> 18:24.549
- OK, please tell me
this is your prank.

18:24.649 --> 18:26.231
You did it.
I'm scared.

18:26.331 --> 18:27.472
Now just make this stop.

18:27.572 --> 18:29.473
- I was hoping this
was you scaring me.

18:29.573 --> 18:32.036
- What? No, I was just going
to put this rubber vomit

18:32.136 --> 18:34.478
on your car later.
- So this is not a prank?

18:34.578 --> 18:35.639
- This is really happening.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.121
- Dad would always return
from these marathon trips

18:38.221 --> 18:40.683
exhausted, talking about
experiments that lasted

18:40.783 --> 18:42.405
late into the night with Chris.

18:42.505 --> 18:44.166
Oh, my God.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.128
- [inhales]

18:46.228 --> 18:48.410
- [exhales]
Yeah.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.732
- This morning,
I wished for a sister.

18:50.832 --> 18:51.773
And now I just get one?

18:51.873 --> 18:53.334
I mean, what kind of
superpower is that?

18:53.434 --> 18:55.976
- She can't be our half-sister.
She just can't.

18:56.076 --> 18:57.658
- Well, all the details line up.

18:57.758 --> 18:58.579
- No, no, no, no.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.541
Because that would mean that I
thought my half-sister was hot.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.863
And that is just--
that is just not ideal.

19:03.963 --> 19:06.105
- That's why she took
Tom's water bottle,

19:06.205 --> 19:07.026
to match his DNA.

19:07.126 --> 19:08.988
- And that's why I sensed
a weird aura around her,

19:09.088 --> 19:11.030
because she's a Hayworth.

19:11.130 --> 19:12.311
No offense.

19:12.411 --> 19:13.031
- Hey.

19:13.131 --> 19:14.232
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

19:14.332 --> 19:15.273
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:15.373 --> 19:16.554
- Look who it is.

19:16.654 --> 19:19.077
- Hey, soul sistah.

19:19.177 --> 19:19.717
No? OK.

19:19.817 --> 19:22.720
- Yeah, it's a lot to process
all at once.

19:22.820 --> 19:23.681
- Nah.
- No.

19:23.781 --> 19:24.882
- W-we're super--
- No.

19:24.982 --> 19:25.923
It's what it is.
- Chill.

19:26.023 --> 19:27.684
- And I'm really sorry
about what happened before.

19:27.784 --> 19:29.486
I was just so wired
from the drive

19:29.586 --> 19:32.568
and freaking out about meeting
a family I never knew I had.

19:32.668 --> 19:34.930
And you guys must have
thought I was a stalker.

19:35.030 --> 19:36.011
- What?
- No.

19:36.111 --> 19:37.092
- No.
- The ruler?

19:37.192 --> 19:39.054
- We are go-with-the-flow
type people.

19:39.154 --> 19:41.696
- And Tom thought you were hot.
And I said, no, Tom.

19:41.796 --> 19:43.738
- Yeah, there's definitely
no way we wanted

19:43.838 --> 19:44.899
to start a podcast about you.

19:44.999 --> 19:47.461
- So yes, I saw an interview
where you talked about

19:47.561 --> 19:48.582
how much was based on your life.

19:48.682 --> 19:50.985
And I just pieced it together
with clues from my own.

19:51.085 --> 19:55.348
And yeah,
it seems like your dad is,

19:55.448 --> 19:56.870
well, my dad.

19:56.970 --> 19:57.871
♪ ♪

19:57.971 --> 20:01.594
- Well, we did know
he had an affair years ago.

20:01.694 --> 20:05.557
- Yeah, we just didn't know
that anything came of it.

20:05.657 --> 20:06.398
- Right.

20:06.498 --> 20:10.121
Like...you.

20:10.221 --> 20:12.723
- Well, hi.

20:12.823 --> 20:14.645
I'm Harmony.

20:14.745 --> 20:17.748
both: Hey.
[together] Hi.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.992
- But you did like
the book, right?

20:24.394 --> 20:25.655
- Uh, which one is he again?

20:25.755 --> 20:26.656
- That's Baron Yohiro.

20:26.756 --> 20:28.417
He acts like a friend
to the Boom Boom Brotherhood,

20:28.517 --> 20:31.019
but you're going to want
to keep an eye on him.

20:31.119 --> 20:31.700
- Hmm.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.382
Well, let's watch one more
episode after this one's over.

20:34.482 --> 20:36.384
- Whatever.

20:36.484 --> 20:37.145
- Oh, boy.

20:37.245 --> 20:38.866
Guys, our DNA tests are in.

20:38.966 --> 20:40.348
- Well?
- Oh.

20:40.448 --> 20:44.992
- Uh, we officially
have a half-sister.

20:45.092 --> 20:47.434
- [exhales]

20:47.534 --> 20:49.896
Whoa.

20:51.137 --> 20:53.959
Oh, also,
we're 2% Ashkenazi Jew.

20:54.059 --> 20:54.760
Huh.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.362
- Oh, I'm 4% Italian.

20:56.462 --> 20:57.322
Mama mia.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.044
- Wait, why did you
get a DNA test?

20:59.144 --> 21:01.246
- What, everything has
to be about the Hayworths?

21:01.346 --> 21:02.367
- Well, who's going to tell Dad?

21:02.467 --> 21:03.808
- Yeah, and what's Mom
going to think?

21:03.908 --> 21:05.530
- I mean, she barely
forgave him for the affair.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.051
This is like
a whole other level.

21:07.151 --> 21:07.852
- That's it.

21:07.952 --> 21:09.533
I can't take this
emotional stress.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.415
Tonight I'm having cookies.

21:11.515 --> 21:14.017
- Ah!
- [laughs]

21:14.117 --> 21:14.898
Yes!

21:14.998 --> 21:17.560
I got you, finally!

21:18.201 --> 21:21.263
Not the best timing,
really, really bad timing.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.625
But I finally did it.

21:23.725 --> 21:25.727
Whoo!
