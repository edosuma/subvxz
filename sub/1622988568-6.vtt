13:56.210 --> 13:57.253
Yeah.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.587
Look, I mean,

13:58.671 --> 14:01.423
it's not like I haven't tried it your way,

14:02.049 --> 14:05.094
but, trust me, this way is much better.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.430
I'll be sure to ask Brad all about it.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.015
If he ever gets here.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.727
Uh, can we get
to the drinking part of this toast?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.354
Indeed. Published is published.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.608
I'm sure this is gonna be
Psychology Today's best-selling issue yet.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.026
To the women of the world,

14:21.652 --> 14:24.154

to you forever.

-Hear, hear! Yes.

[Kossi] Hey!

14:27.449 --> 14:28.659
You made it.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.455
Excuse me. [clears throat]

Where have you been? Are you flipping out?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.838
If you're flipping out,
then just tell me now.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.549
I'm not flipping out.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.429
I'm late because I was cleaning out...

14:51.140 --> 14:54.768
every bodega between here and...

14:56.729 --> 14:57.688
Houston.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.985
Get used to me coming home.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.699
I got a real family for the first time.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.077
And I'm not going anywhere.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.163

15:24.173 --> 15:27.176
And crawling back to me a good two
to five years ahead of schedule?

15:27.259 --> 15:28.135
Hmm?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.304
Are you okay?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.683
I need to talk to you.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.186
Sure. Come on in.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.486
So...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.113
what's going on?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.073
I don't know.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.077
I have a beautiful life.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.665
I have a beautiful husband.

15:58.832 --> 15:59.667
Or I...

16:01.168 --> 16:02.711
did, but I'm, um...

16:03.837 --> 16:05.172
I'm messing it all up.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.175
You know I have to ask,
but do you think you're messing it all up

16:08.258 --> 16:12.596
because you've convinced yourself
that it's more beautiful than it is?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.681
No. God, no.

16:14.515 --> 16:19.061
I mean, 85% of my marriage is
the stuff that people dream about.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.062
It's--

16:21.230 --> 16:23.607
It's just that 15%...

16:23.691 --> 16:24.942
Which is?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.111
-Sex.
-Ah.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.656
Which I know is a dumb reason
to screw up your marriage.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.658
Sex is rarely just about sex.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.994
What's it about for you?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.121
Desire.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.500
Feeling desired.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.087
But then also...

16:46.922 --> 16:47.965
freedom.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.136
To be anyone...

16:53.429 --> 16:54.930
to do anything.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.184
I just haven't felt that way since...

16:59.268 --> 17:00.185
Brad.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.314
There's no judgment here.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.776
A few months ago, I--

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
[dramatic music playing]

17:12.031 --> 17:13.949
I started writing in my journal.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.787
I was fantasizing about...

17:21.707 --> 17:26.670
all the... crazy chemistry
that we used to have...

17:30.257 --> 17:31.133
and things...

17:35.721 --> 17:36.972
just snowballed.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.557
Billie...

17:42.936 --> 17:43.771
You're beautiful.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.651
That's the 15% reminding you
it's still there.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.153
But I have Cooper.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.699
I mean, you should see
my children and this man

17:56.450 --> 17:58.077
who would give me anything.

17:59.119 --> 18:04.208
Who's trying to give me everything
that I want, but somehow it's just--

18:06.752 --> 18:08.003
It's not the same.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.630
It can't be.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.008
The person who gives you all that security

18:13.092 --> 18:16.929
can't be the same person
who gives you the... thrill,

18:17.012 --> 18:19.807
the risk, the excitement, the lust. It...

18:21.141 --> 18:22.142
doesn't work that way.

18:24.686 --> 18:29.108
So there's no solution that doesn't
involve me cheating on my husband?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.069
Isn't that why you came to see me?

18:32.152 --> 18:35.280
I came to see you because you're
the closest thing I have to a shrink.

18:35.364 --> 18:39.701
But I'm also the guy who doesn't believe
in that "till death do us part" crap...

18:40.744 --> 18:42.913
so maybe you came here looking for a pass.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.041
And maybe that's okay.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.086
But you never would, right?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.338
You're the monogamist.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.298
And it's 85/15, so...

18:55.259 --> 18:56.260
Cooper wins.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.557
Unless...

19:03.851 --> 19:05.602
Unless what?

19:06.770 --> 19:11.608
Unless you think there's a world
in which Brad could somehow give you both.

[cell phone unlocks]

19:35.090 --> 19:36.133

19:41.388 --> 19:43.223
I'm in the city. Where are you?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.438
Now, this is a unique opportunity
that could make a real difference

19:49.521 --> 19:51.732
in millions of people's lives,

19:51.815 --> 19:53.984
and we're hoping
you'll see it that way too.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.286
Any questions?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.622
I think we're all set.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.832
Thank you, Cooper.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.377
This technology is revolutionary.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.796
I mean, this is the future
of modern medicine.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.965
Right. We got it.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.928
Can we have a minute alone with Francesca?

Sure. Yeah, no problem.

What the hell happened in there?

20:57.756 --> 21:00.592
What, they liked the idea,
but they didn't like me or something?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.844
I know I'm exhausted and distracted.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.971
They loved you.

21:04.596 --> 21:08.141
So much so, they asked me
how I felt about making you partner.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.648
Holy shit.

21:14.731 --> 21:19.361
I told them it's an interesting idea
and, frankly, overdue.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.905
Oh, my God.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.533
You deserve it, Cooper.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.412
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.164
Best decision I ever made.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.836
Hey, can we talk?

21:37.004 --> 21:37.879
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.344
Thank you.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.181
Um...

21:49.474 --> 21:51.893
So about last night.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.981
Uh... you are an amazing listener,

21:56.064 --> 21:57.774
and I so appreciate that.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.739
Obviously, I have some things
that I need to work out at home.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.324
-Um...
-Or not.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.121
Look, I would never break up a happy home.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.542
But since your home doesn't seem
so happy at the moment...

22:17.753 --> 22:20.047
You're the full package, Cooper.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.632
And I've had to learn the hard way

22:22.716 --> 22:25.802
that when a great guy like you
gets divorced,

22:25.886 --> 22:28.055
they get snatched up real fast.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.390
And I don't wanna miss my shot.

22:30.474 --> 22:35.395
Oh, Francesca,
I'm... flattered, really. Uh...

22:36.355 --> 22:39.483
It's just that's-- That's not where
Billie and I are at right now.

for me to find someone

22:46.990 --> 22:49.868
who feels like he can be a real partner?

22:53.538 --> 22:56.500
I like who I am when I'm with you.

22:57.918 --> 23:02.047
And I think you like who you are
when you're with me.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.298
No, of course I do.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.884
And I realize
this is wildly inappropriate,

23:05.967 --> 23:07.969
not just because you're married.

23:08.512 --> 23:12.557
I'm your boss, and we know I had to work
twice as hard to get to where I am.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.809
Sure.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.479
So I wouldn't risk this for just anyone.
