00:06.172 --> 00:08.216
(grand music playing)

00:08.299 --> 00:11.177
(commotion)

00:11.261 --> 00:14.305
(indistinct chatter)

00:16.266 --> 00:18.184
I'm here live outside
of Santa's mansion,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.311
where he and The Board
have been meeting all day

00:20.395 --> 00:23.398
on the decision for who
will be the next Successor.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.941
Recent polls show
Candy Smalls

00:25.024 --> 00:26.901
has a commanding
lead over her rivals,

00:26.985 --> 00:29.028
despite initial
concerns that
the public

00:29.112 --> 00:30.613
would reject
a female Santa.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.324
Now, as soon as
that Christmas tree
behind me lights up,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.785
the choice for Successor
will have been made.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.164
Candy Smalls is
the worst boss ever!

00:39.247 --> 00:40.707
She forced me to do
horrible things,

00:40.790 --> 00:42.292
and then fired me
when I wouldn't.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.628
Breaking news!
Are you referring
to coerced sexual acts?

00:45.712 --> 00:50.717
Ew, no!
She made me work even
when I was hungover.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.427
(cheers and applause)

00:52.510 --> 00:53.553
Mazel Tov!

00:53.636 --> 00:55.513
There is a new Successor, folks.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.600
And keeping with tradition,
in exactly 30 minutes,

00:58.683 --> 01:01.019
Santa will announce
who will be the next

01:01.102 --> 01:02.896
face of Christmas!

01:02.979 --> 01:07.609
T-minus 30 until
a vagina finally
sits in the red suit!

01:07.692 --> 01:09.778
Or another penis.
Who knows?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.613
Everybody, drink up!

01:11.696 --> 01:13.031
(cheering)

01:13.573 --> 01:15.200
Ha, ha.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.786
I have a really good
feeling about tonight.

01:17.869 --> 01:21.289
(joyful music playing)

01:26.252 --> 01:28.296
♪ ♪

01:33.968 --> 01:36.888
I'm Jonathan Silverbell,
and we are 28 minutes away

01:36.971 --> 01:38.556
from this historic moment.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.141
Any thoughts on Candy Smalls?

01:40.225 --> 01:44.020
This "Candy-monium" may be
"inspiring" and "cute,"

01:44.103 --> 01:45.146
but it's unearned.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.689
Santas have always been male.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.276
For the same reason there
have only been male explorers

01:50.360 --> 01:53.363
or U.S. Presidents
or serial killers.

01:53.446 --> 01:57.784
I think Timmy the Toy Guy would
make a much more solid choice.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.036
But not from
a psychological standpoint.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.205
For Santa, every chimney jump

02:02.288 --> 02:06.167
is a trip down
the vaginal canal, a re-birth.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.127
Since Timmy was
a C-section baby,

02:08.211 --> 02:09.420
this is irrelevant to him.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.006
Are you all crazy?
Timmy's a fucking Neo-Nazi!

02:12.090 --> 02:14.175
And I know I call
a lot of people that,

02:14.259 --> 02:15.552
but he really is.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.764
Keep the rumors
in your annex, Anne Frank.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.059
Oh my!
You have to watch
this, Nick.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.102
Look at that crowd.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.603
It's like
I'm headlining Coachella!

02:25.687 --> 02:26.855
It's exciting.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.566
The announcement
of the first female Santa.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.818
I assume you're
picking Candy, right?

02:31.901 --> 02:34.237
You know I'm sworn
to secrecy but trust me,

02:34.320 --> 02:37.073
I'm makin'
the right choice,
a solid choice.

02:37.156 --> 02:40.076
C'mon, just tell me
it's Candy so I can relax.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.579
I know how to get
it out of you.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.289
Yes, I do.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.041
(laughs)
Oh-ho, I can't tell!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.418
I took an oath!
(laughs)

02:48.501 --> 02:51.462
It's serious business
even though I'm laughing!

02:51.546 --> 02:53.464
Fucking stop!
I don't like it. Stop.

02:53.548 --> 02:58.469
When you chose Brent,
I was in on every moment
of that decision.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.847
Oh yes, that's when
I was a partner,

03:00.930 --> 03:02.765
and not just
some idiot wife.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.227
Honestly, I don't have
the energy for this
fuckin' shit, dude, okay?

03:06.311 --> 03:09.439
Tonight's clutch time.
All I need is support.
Thank you.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.442
Candy Smalls, insiders say
you've got this locked up.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.485
Well, there are
several contenders

03:14.569 --> 03:16.738
here who would make
fantastic Santas.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.574
I guess what I'm saying,
Cuthbert, is I'm hopeful,

03:19.657 --> 03:22.452
but I'm not measuring
the drapes quite yet.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.287
Measure this, viper!

03:24.370 --> 03:26.247
Hello, eligible men
of the world!

03:26.331 --> 03:27.081
I'm the Mommy.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.333
Uh, no.
Not my Mother.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.585
Just a schizophrenic
drug-addicted rapist.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.921
I, I should probably
get her back to prison.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.964
Too bad, I was hoping
to interview your

03:35.048 --> 03:36.007
nearest and dearest.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.217
Get the insight
on the real you.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.261
Well, you should talk
to my best friends.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.972
They're, uh, um,
where are they?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.766
We really have
to go to this shit?

03:44.849 --> 03:46.851
Stop asking
me that, yes!

03:46.935 --> 03:50.104
Our best friend
is about to become
the next Santa.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.356
We have to be there.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.524
She just doesn't seem
like my best friend anymore.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.651
Come on. She's busy.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.486
And that allows her
to completely blow us off

03:56.569 --> 03:58.237
after 20 years
of friendship?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
We just need to rally
for the bitch.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.619
(gasps)
Wow, when I say "bitch,"
I kind of mean "bitch."

04:04.702 --> 04:06.704
That's intense.
C'mon, Craig!

04:06.788 --> 04:09.666
Jemma, keep Fun Size
away from the scissors.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.919
He's obsessed
with them lately.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.213
Larson, uh, polls show
that you're way down

04:15.296 --> 04:17.674
because of recent
allegations of infidelity,

04:17.757 --> 04:20.259
sexual harassment,
and statutory rape.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.302
Would you like
to say anything

04:21.386 --> 04:23.346
to the women who feel
betrayed by you?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.389
L-Look, let me be clear.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.349
I am a man
who loves women.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.435
Like my hot wife,
and hot adult stepdaughters.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.355
But a woman doesn't have
to be hot for me to love her.

04:32.438 --> 04:36.317
To me, the sexiest woman who
ever lived is Eleanor Roosevelt.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.319
(retches)

04:38.403 --> 04:40.154
(laughs)
I don't believe any

04:40.238 --> 04:42.031
of these insane
allegations.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.367
How could my husband
be such a monster

04:44.450 --> 04:46.661
when he surprised me
with Celine Dion tickets

04:46.744 --> 04:49.831
-for our anniversary?
-And in the mezzanine, too!

04:49.914 --> 04:51.082
Not cheap.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.459
Everyone knows
how much I care

04:53.543 --> 04:55.545
about the welfare
of women.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.298
Grandpa Smalls:
Everybody!
This is the big night!

04:59.382 --> 05:03.094
But let's not forget
what's truly important:

05:03.177 --> 05:06.556
we get 10% of all
winners' bets. Ha-hoo!

05:06.639 --> 05:10.184
You can't do that in here.
It's fucking illegal!

05:10.268 --> 05:12.186
(softly):
But let's see
how I'm doing.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.981
Ooh, even odds!
Woo! Yes, bitch!

05:15.064 --> 05:17.734
All the retired coal miners
bet on you, even though

05:17.817 --> 05:21.112
I told them you suck,
and you turned your
back on us elves.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.156
Grandpa, just
please calm down.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.158
I have a strategy, trust me.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.996
Ooh, a stratège.
Fancy-schmancy.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.456
You're ruthless,
Candy.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.790
I told you
to be a snake,

05:32.874 --> 05:35.501
and you turned into
a fucking anaconda.

05:35.585 --> 05:40.256
Somehow, I suspect you're
all gonna magically love me
again once I'm made Santa.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.592
Candy, I know you're
ashamed of me,

05:42.675 --> 05:44.927
but I never, ever thought
the day would come

05:45.011 --> 05:46.929
where I would be
ashamed of you.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.057
You've been ashamed
of me my entire life.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.768
That was just
a motivational
parenting tactic.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.395
This is the first time
I mean it.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.608
(huffs)

05:59.776 --> 06:01.944
-There she is! Candy!
-Woo!

06:02.028 --> 06:04.113
Frat Guys (chanting):
Candy!

06:04.197 --> 06:05.782
Frat Guy 1:
Candy's the man!

06:05.865 --> 06:08.576
Frat Guy 2:
Igma Loo's goes big for Smalls!

06:08.659 --> 06:10.953
(laughs)
Thanks for the love,
everybody!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.622
Candy forever!

06:12.705 --> 06:14.207
Junior:
Tonight is momentous!

06:14.290 --> 06:17.794
Like Jesus' resurrection
and the Book of Revelation
rolled up in one.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.504
But if God doesn't
want me to be Successor,

06:19.587 --> 06:21.297
then I will accept
His other gift to me:

06:21.380 --> 06:23.674
being the leader
of His reindeer disciples.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.469
Which is probably way more
important than Santa anyway.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.137
Unless he chooses
me as Successor.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.972
And then, that's the shit!

06:30.056 --> 06:31.432
It's in the
Book of Revelations!

06:31.516 --> 06:34.435
-Congregation: Yes!
-Jesus take me!

06:34.519 --> 06:36.938
(speaking tongues)

06:37.021 --> 06:39.065
What the fuck?
Quick, cut to
something else!

06:39.148 --> 06:40.525
The terror you feel?

06:40.608 --> 06:42.485
Multiply that
by a thousand,

06:42.568 --> 06:43.861
and that's how women

06:43.945 --> 06:46.656
and BIPOC feel
at every moment.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.117
Shit,
that bitch
is pissed.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.829
Yeah, girl!
Millennial the shit
outta that old fuck!

06:55.540 --> 06:58.334
Great, my buds!
You're finally here!

06:58.417 --> 07:00.294
-(customer coughs)
-(customer clears throat)

07:01.420 --> 07:02.296
(groans)

07:03.256 --> 07:04.215
Hey, look, you guys,

07:04.298 --> 07:06.926
I, I know a lot
has been going on,

07:07.009 --> 07:09.637
and I just wanna tell you...

07:10.930 --> 07:12.431
you have impeccable timing.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.433
The HNN reporter
wants to do an interview

07:14.517 --> 07:16.227
with my best friends.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.520
All right,
where'd he go?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.272
Devin:
Babe!

07:21.440 --> 07:23.067
Hold on, wait.
What is this?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.528
Devin and I
are dating.
And fucking.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.157
And fingering with
an eye towards anal?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.241
Yes! Score!

07:30.324 --> 07:32.493
You guys are together?
Since when?

07:32.577 --> 07:33.870
Right after Halloween.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.164
Oh no, Horse Cock is wasted.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.915
He's trying to fuck
the pool table.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.375
(shouts):
That's not a lady, bud!

07:39.458 --> 07:41.252
You've been together
for almost a month,

07:41.335 --> 07:42.545
and you didn't tell me?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.505
I've called you and text you,

07:44.589 --> 07:46.841
but I never, ever,
ever heard back.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.093
I know,
and I've been meaning to,

07:49.177 --> 07:50.970
but time is just--
it's flying by,

07:51.053 --> 07:54.182
and... whatever, if, if
this is what you want,

07:54.265 --> 07:56.809
they hey...
Mazel Tov!

07:56.893 --> 07:59.270
Yay!
Jewish phrases of joy!

07:59.353 --> 08:00.688
We're all happy now!

08:00.771 --> 08:02.106
Can we table
this tension

08:02.190 --> 08:04.775
for, maybe, not
the biggest night
of my life?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.445
Here we are live
with Candy Smalls
and her friends.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.031
It's been said that
behind every great Santa,

08:10.114 --> 08:13.242
there is an entourage
of close buds.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.535
Here's my crew.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.662
My BFFs since
high school,

08:16.746 --> 08:17.914
Goldie and Cookie.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.291
Goldie, Cookie,
we know so little

08:20.374 --> 08:22.210
about Candy,
the person.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.878
Who is Candy Smalls to you?

08:23.961 --> 08:27.215
I'm talking real-life
details of who she is.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.134
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.303
(tense music plays)

08:32.386 --> 08:34.013
But even way back when,

08:34.096 --> 08:35.765
there was always something

08:35.848 --> 08:37.516
different about Candy.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.145
I mean, what girl forces
everyone to watch CSPAN

08:41.229 --> 08:43.105
at her Sweet 16?

08:43.189 --> 08:44.774
It's a little weird, right?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.777
Ugh, why you?!
You're nothing!

08:47.860 --> 08:49.445
Ugh. Let's kill her.

08:49.528 --> 08:52.949
Actually, let's kill
her stylist 'cause
her outfit is pure ass.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.451
-Ha ha! Ha ha!
-Snow Angel:
Maybe you heard Santa wrong.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.954
Maybe the next Santa
will actually be you.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.789
Santa's never
taken me seriously!

08:59.872 --> 09:01.207
I thought we
had a special bond,

09:01.290 --> 09:02.625
but he just left me
out in the back alley

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
with my pants
around my ankles!

09:04.335 --> 09:07.255
Like everyone else!
Except you!

09:07.338 --> 09:09.423
I'm being nice.
Why am I yelling?

09:09.507 --> 09:10.841
Thank you
for staying with me!

09:10.925 --> 09:12.468
I am so fucked up!

09:12.551 --> 09:14.136
Aw, thanks, baby.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.638
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.848
I know who's selling
Santa's beard hair--

09:17.932 --> 09:20.977
Sparky Fontaine:
Jingle Jim! J-Jingle Jim!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.813
-Sparky Fontaine, HNN News.
-Ugh! The press?!

09:23.896 --> 09:27.567
Sparky:
Any comments about your chances
of becoming Successor?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.819
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

09:29.902 --> 09:32.738
Jingle Jim says,
"Guzzle my piss!"

09:32.822 --> 09:35.283
Subheader,
He's very dehydrated.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.159
Sparky:
God, it's in
my eye! God!

09:37.243 --> 09:38.911
Don't help me,
keep rolling!

09:38.995 --> 09:39.954
(laughs)

09:40.037 --> 09:44.709
(cries) I wanted
to be Santa so bad.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.169
Don't worry.
We'll be okay.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.089
You really are an angel.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.842
What would it be like
if your closest friend

09:52.925 --> 09:55.761
became the next Santa?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.054
Great, right?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.681
(cries)
I'm afraid
I'll never

09:58.764 --> 09:59.974
see her again.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.142
And that she'll become an even

10:01.225 --> 10:02.310
bigger asshole than she

10:02.393 --> 10:03.227
already is.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.520
Oh my god.
I love you, too,

10:04.603 --> 10:05.646
asshole.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.731
We call each other
asshole.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.982
It's an inside joke,
you know?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.443
Long history.
The bonds between women.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.445
Re-claiming words
and making them our own.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.280
It's kind of
beautiful, you know?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.781
It's gorgeous.
Now, Goldie,

10:15.865 --> 10:17.158
has all this attention

10:17.241 --> 10:19.702
changed your
old friend, Candy?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.037
Ah, not sure.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.540
Candy, have you always
been ruthless and cutthroat?

10:24.623 --> 10:28.169
(laughs)
You guys!
Be serious!

10:28.252 --> 10:29.545
Women's friendships.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.630
Our, our chosen families,
so to speak,

10:31.714 --> 10:35.217
so, so complicated,
so invaluable, ha, ha.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.803
Oh, I think that's Santa.
I'd recognize that red hat

10:37.887 --> 10:40.139
with the white fuzzy ball
on top from a mile away.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.558
Santa!
Get out of my way!

10:42.641 --> 10:44.810
May we speak
privately?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.730
With only eight minutes left
until Santa's announcement,

10:47.813 --> 10:50.816
I'm at the toy factory
where Timmy the Toy Guy

10:50.900 --> 10:52.276
was literally born,

10:52.360 --> 10:55.696
the only child
of a stock boy
and gift wrapper.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.698
Let's see what Timmy's up to.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.910
On this frosty, sacred soil,

11:00.993 --> 11:03.120
in this very toy shop,

11:03.204 --> 11:06.248
my papa asked my mama to have

11:06.332 --> 11:09.794
sexual intercourse
and she consented.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.798
And 18 seconds later,
I was conceived.

11:13.881 --> 11:18.135
And here we are today
in the same toy shop.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.180
Another decision to be made.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.724
Timmy, do you
think your chances
at succession

11:23.808 --> 11:25.559
have been impacted
by rumored ties

11:25.643 --> 11:27.269
to the white nationalist
movement?

11:27.353 --> 11:30.064
What holiday
are you from,
by the way?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.774
-Diwali.
-Di-what-i?

11:31.857 --> 11:36.362
-Must be a new one.
-It's 2,500 years old,
older than Christmas.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.824
Sounds made up
to me, Four Arms.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.370
Mader Chod,
that was weird.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.289
Why would you say that shit?
That is a major new outlet.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.791
The whole world
will see it.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.292
So? What we
said is true.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.087
-You pushed us there.
-And you agree
with that, Cookie?

11:53.170 --> 11:56.632
I can't answer that
because if I start
to talk, I'll cry.

11:56.715 --> 12:00.219
And it's really hard
to talk and cry
at the same time.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.554
You guys, listen,

12:01.637 --> 12:04.140
I understand I've done some
really messed up stuff,

12:04.223 --> 12:07.476
but in a few minutes,
I might be named the next Santa.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.770
And I can start
fighting for all of us.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.313
I know it started out that way,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.482
but you're not fighting
for us anymore, okay?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.484
You've become
completely selfish.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.903
I'm sorry, did you
just call me Elf-ish?

12:17.987 --> 12:21.365
Because I will fight you
right now for judging
my people like that.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.658
Let's go! Right now!

12:22.741 --> 12:25.661
Stop!
She said selfish.
You're selfish.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.788
Oh, okay.
Well, that's
insulting, too,

12:27.872 --> 12:30.291
but I'm not gonna
fight a jacked
reindeer over it.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.668
But I would take you.
If I had to, I would.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.922
-(cries)
-Oh, Cookie, don't cry.
Not tonight.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.382
Not on my special night.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.926
Not on the night
my dreams are
coming true.

12:41.010 --> 12:47.391
You are such a--
I can't talk and cry.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.517
Good luck, kids!

12:48.601 --> 12:51.312
You're about to have
the worst Santa ever!

12:51.395 --> 12:53.022
The worst Santa?
Oh my god.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.691
What I'm hearing is that you
think I have this in the bag.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.320
Woo! Oh, let's go in!
It's almost time!

13:01.238 --> 13:02.865
Okay, fine,
if you will excuse me,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.701
I am going to spend the most
exciting moment in my life

13:05.784 --> 13:07.620
with my new best friend,
Horse Cock.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.871
We totally get each other.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.373
He loves to read
recovery memoirs, too.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.875
It's fucking beshert!

13:12.958 --> 13:13.876
That's "meant to be"

13:13.959 --> 13:16.045
in the language
of my Jewish peeps.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.672
I'm out. Shalom!

13:18.756 --> 13:20.591
Devin:
Candy, I have to show
you something.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.802
-Now? But it's almost time to--
-Real fast. You won't be sorry.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.472
Okay, you can look.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.973
Oh my god,
oh my god,
oh my god.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.099
(angelic singing)

13:29.183 --> 13:31.727
Devin, this is
so thoughtful.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.605
I'm, I'm seriously moved.
Is my makeup okay?

13:34.688 --> 13:37.608
Yeah, you're good.
And you'll look
amazing in this.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.818
Red really brings
out your veins.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.403
I'm so happy
for you, Candy.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.030
No one deserves
this more than you.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.032
I'm so happy for us.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.992
And, you know, even though
you're still in college,

13:47.076 --> 13:48.911
I have such a great
feeling about you.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.665
So, forget about what
I said about years
of training and all that.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.709
When you graduate,
you're gonna be
my number two.

13:55.793 --> 13:59.004
What do ya think?
Ready to stroll
into history by my side?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.090
Ho-oh! Yes, ma'am!

14:01.173 --> 14:02.841
Crowd in bar:
One minute to go!

14:02.925 --> 14:03.884
You ready?

14:06.512 --> 14:07.680
Here we go.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.099
All right, here we go.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.935
Again. Fuckin' Brent.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.564
Crowd:
15, 14, 13,

14:16.647 --> 14:19.942
12, 11, 10,

14:20.025 --> 14:24.446
nine, eight, seven, six,

14:24.530 --> 14:29.076
five, four, three, two,

14:29.159 --> 14:30.035
one!

14:30.119 --> 14:31.579
Wow, this is it.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.124
Candace Smalls,
your big moment
has arrived.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.751
People of the North Pole,

14:37.835 --> 14:40.254
or as you are known,
North Pollocks.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.132
Crowd (chanting):
Santa! Santa! Santa!

14:43.215 --> 14:47.303
It is with much pride that I
and The Board of Santa Inc.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.680
tell you of our choice
of a new Successor.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.891
But, before I give you the name,
I wanna assure you

14:52.975 --> 14:56.186
that I've chosen not only
the best future Santa,

14:56.270 --> 14:58.981
but an exciting choice,
an innovative choice,

14:59.064 --> 15:03.819
and someone who
exemplifies the qualities
the job of Santa requires:

15:03.902 --> 15:08.449
compassion, joy,
devotion to Santa Inc.,
but most of all,

15:08.532 --> 15:12.119
an unwavering love of Christmas,
and the belief in its ability

15:12.202 --> 15:13.912
to make the world
a better place,

15:13.996 --> 15:16.540
even if it's just
for one day a year.

15:16.624 --> 15:22.171
And now may I announce
the next Santa Claus...

15:22.254 --> 15:25.341
(intense music plays)

15:28.260 --> 15:30.262
Devin Johnson!

15:30.346 --> 15:32.181
(crowd gasps)

15:32.264 --> 15:34.516
(Santa's voice echoing)

15:34.600 --> 15:37.311
(muffled audio)

15:40.147 --> 15:42.358
Who the fuck
is Devin Johnson?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.776
(all gasping)

15:43.859 --> 15:45.361
-(cries)
-(grunts)

15:46.654 --> 15:48.822
We're rich!

15:49.698 --> 15:52.159
(cheering)

15:53.202 --> 15:54.536
(person coughing)

15:58.457 --> 16:00.042
Congratulation--
(clears throat)

16:00.125 --> 16:02.503
Congratulations,
Mr. Successor.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.505
-(stomach gurgling)
-Oh!

16:06.507 --> 16:08.258
-(commotion)
-(shutters clicking)

16:08.342 --> 16:09.426
Whoa!

16:09.510 --> 16:12.388
Devin Johnson,
we spoke earlier,
remember?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.723
You know me!
Ugh, fucker!

16:14.807 --> 16:16.725
Devin! Devin!

16:17.768 --> 16:19.311
(toilet flushes)

16:21.480 --> 16:23.649
D-D-Did ya win?

16:23.732 --> 16:25.609
Baby Meatball's
in the manger.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.821
Mmm, meatball.
Excuse me, sir?

16:28.904 --> 16:31.156
I, I just puked,
so I'm starving.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.409
Oh, oh, c-can we stop
at a drive-through?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.411
(crowd shouting)

16:37.955 --> 16:39.623
(horn honking)

16:41.125 --> 16:43.293
Here, this should work.
Take it from me.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.046
I've seen my fair share
of puke-covered suits.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.424
Used to work at a bar
on Wall Street in the '80s.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.218
Ah, there's a lot of it.
What did that guy eat?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.595
Hey, you don't
have to hold it
in for me, Candy.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.682
I know you're upset.
You can let it all out.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.935
Oh, I'm fine. I'm so fine.
It's all good, man.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.645
I mean, I'm,
I'm not fine,

17:01.729 --> 17:03.105
and not all good, no,

17:03.188 --> 17:05.274
but, uh, I don't know,
what am I gonna do?

17:05.357 --> 17:07.985
Cry like a baby because
I didn't get my way?

17:08.068 --> 17:11.572
You know?
"Wahhh, I didn't
get to be Santa."

17:11.655 --> 17:13.031
It's just--
It's not productive.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.117
I need to suck it up,
and move on, and--

17:15.200 --> 17:16.285
Oh god!
Please don't gloat.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.786
Please don't say,
"I told you so."

17:17.870 --> 17:19.163
Or steal
my credit cards.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.165
I just-- I'm not strong
enough right now to--

17:21.248 --> 17:22.166
You wish.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.501
We don't need your
money anymore, ha, ha.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.296
Nope. I put all
of my savings on Devin.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.381
He was 10,000-to-one.
I'm worth millions now!

17:29.465 --> 17:31.967
But how could you possibly
know it would be Devin?

17:32.050 --> 17:35.137
You mean the fat kid
with the beard?

17:35.220 --> 17:37.306
It was always gonna be him.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.474
You put up a good fight,

17:38.557 --> 17:40.601
but ya can't beat
tradition, baby.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.478
That's Christmas.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.606
Ohh! Who's rich?
Cha-cha-cha!

17:45.689 --> 17:48.025
Grandpa's rich!
Cha-cha-cha!

17:48.108 --> 17:50.444
Today has been
way too intense.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.529
The holidays are
too stressful.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.448
Girl, they haven't
even started yet.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.450
(sighs)
I hate Christmas.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.703
-(phone ringing)
-Ugh, it's Candy again.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.498
She's called me twice.
Maybe we should talk to her.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.501
She must be so miserable.
She wanted this so bad.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.461
I mean, I know she
was a bitch to us,

18:07.544 --> 18:08.837
and said some
fucked-up shit--

18:08.921 --> 18:11.924
And did fucked-up shit!
The girl needs a timeout.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.635
Maybe she'll go back to being
the person we used to know.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.262
Maybe not. But right now,
I can't deal with her shit.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.849
I guess you're right,
but everything is so stressful.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.684
Oh god!
I'm losing it!

18:22.768 --> 18:25.437
I am this close
to eating my clavicle.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.815
-(line ringing)
-Devin's not picking up.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.275
-Do you think he's ghosting me?
-Where's Craig?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.986
I wanna go home
and watch
Leprechaun's Kitchen.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.822
-Girl: Ahh!
-Is that your babysitter?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.573
-Ahh!
-(Fun Size laughs)

18:36.657 --> 18:40.118
-Ahh!
-Fun Size! Scissors bad!

18:41.453 --> 18:45.749
(yelling)
Oh, man!

18:45.833 --> 18:49.586
The best aphrodisiac really is
a sweet dose of schadenfreude.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.464
Now how 'bout you
get back there
and toss my salad a little?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.216
Okay, but do you wanna know

18:54.299 --> 18:56.468
who is selling
Santa's beard hair first?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.929
Or do you want me
to toss your salad first?

18:59.012 --> 19:01.890
-Tell me fast, then salad.
-Okay.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.309
(ominous music playing)

19:06.144 --> 19:09.648
Pardon me, are you the one
selling Santa's beard hair?

19:10.732 --> 19:12.985
Yeah, how much you want?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.487
(gasps)

19:19.408 --> 19:20.784
Beat it, man.
We're closed.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.746
Oh! Oh, I'm,
I'm, I'm sorry.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.373
I didn't realize
it was you.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.833
I was looking for Candy.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.918
Candy, she left
a while ago.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.795
She was pretty
devastated.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.589
So am I.
I just--

19:33.672 --> 19:37.593
How could he-- Gah!
I cannot believe--

19:37.676 --> 19:40.429
I left Santa,
not that he noticed.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.471
I didn't know where to go,

19:41.555 --> 19:44.057
and you said I could
always come here

19:44.141 --> 19:45.601
to the Thirsty Deer.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.603
Well, I am glad you're here.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.731
Can I, uh, buy you
a drink, Mrs. Claus?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.942
Call me Leonard.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.404
Woo! Sexy... Why?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.325
Santa:
Thanks for meeting me.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.786
Santa calls
and I come running.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.246
Story of my life.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.416
I know you're pissed,
and I wanted to explain myself.

20:09.499 --> 20:14.463
Yeah, mansplain...
S-Sant... Sants-plain...

20:14.546 --> 20:16.298
Nick, Saint Nick-splain--

20:16.381 --> 20:18.467
Whatever! There's,
there's something there.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.844
You really blew me away
these last few months.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.472
You did.
You proved you have
a million qualities

20:23.555 --> 20:27.643
that make you
so awesome
for this job.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.311
I knew you were
my next Successor.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.813
I had every intention
of choosing you,

20:31.897 --> 20:33.857
but then I saw you
with the kids.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.734
-What kids?
-At the hospital.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.986
You know,
when they all came
in my room to say hi?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.822
That's really when it
became clear to me.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.824
You don't like
being around children,

20:42.908 --> 20:45.118
and they feel
the awkwardness.
They know it.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.787
And they don't like you
as a result of it.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.164
-Fine, but that doesn't--
-L-Let me just
get this out, okay?

20:49.247 --> 20:52.876
You can talk all day
about making Christmas
great for the children

20:52.960 --> 20:56.171
who will one day lead the world,
but can you talk to them?

20:56.254 --> 20:58.590
Connect with them?
No. They ran away from you,

20:58.674 --> 21:00.050
and straight to Devin.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.427
So I'm not
warm and cuddly.
Big deal.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.221
I know how to get
the job done.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.682
Warm and cuddly is the job.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.684
Don't you see my dilemma?
Yo-You-- (sighs)

21:08.767 --> 21:11.311
You don't understand
the pressure of a man
in my position.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.896
How could I, in good conscience,

21:12.980 --> 21:15.399
choose a Santa who is
not good with kids?

21:15.482 --> 21:17.484
-That's something
I could learn.
-Not true.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.778
When it comes to kids,
you either have it or you don't.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.781
-Oh.
-But... you're right.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.866
You do know how
to get shit done.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.576
Better than anyone.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.871
And Devin isn't anywhere
near ready to be Santa,

21:29.955 --> 21:33.083
and that's why you're
going to guide him.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.252
Devin will be
the fun and jolly
face of the company,

21:35.335 --> 21:39.172
but you will be
doing the real work,
behind the scenes,

21:39.256 --> 21:42.009
making sure Santa Inc.
runs perfectly.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.804
And you'll be able
to make all your great
new innovations come true.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.431
Yeah, behind the scenes.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.641
Don't let your ego
get in the way, okay?

21:49.725 --> 21:52.227
It doesn't matter who
actually wears the red suit.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.105
You and Devin will both have
the jobs you were meant to do,

21:55.188 --> 21:57.399
but Santa Inc. will
be a better place

21:57.482 --> 21:58.567
because of you.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.318
This wasn't
an easy decision,

22:00.402 --> 22:01.945
but it's right
and it's final.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.697

22:11.455 --> 22:12.873
