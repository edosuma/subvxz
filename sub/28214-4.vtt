WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.613
[rain falling, thunder rumbling]

00:06.441 --> 00:08.399
[distant siren wailing]

00:10.575 --> 00:12.838
So, this is global warming?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.058
I think it's just Chicago.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.061
We should move to San Diego.Mm.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.237
[chuckles]

00:21.760 --> 00:23.980
Doesn't look good.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.070
She'll be fine.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.422
And what is
the current disposition

00:31.596 --> 00:32.945
of the drug charges?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
Under review.JULIUS:
Forgive me, Maia,

00:35.383 --> 00:37.385
but as managing partner,
I have to ask this.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.430
Do you have a drug problem?

00:39.604 --> 00:40.953
No. God, no.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.435
The drugs were foisted upon me
by Roland Blum.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.437
And these were the drugs
the police found in your car?

00:46.611 --> 00:48.396
Yes.Foisted

00:48.570 --> 00:50.180
but not planted?

00:50.354 --> 00:52.574
MADELINE:
So, if you weren't
using yourself,

00:52.748 --> 00:55.011
why'd you allow him
to foist anything on you?

00:55.185 --> 00:58.797
I don't know how much experience
you've had with Roland Blum.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.452
The, uh, the standard playbook

01:01.626 --> 01:02.671
goes out the window.

01:02.845 --> 01:03.933
BARRY:
Does that extend to throwing

01:04.107 --> 01:05.108
a computer through a glass wall?

01:05.282 --> 01:06.501
ADRIAN:
Admittedly,

01:06.675 --> 01:08.633
we've all lost our temper
on occasion.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.157
I didn't lose my temper.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.159
Blum thought
that he could intimidate me,

01:12.333 --> 01:15.162
and I had to let him know
that I wasn't intimidated.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.338
There may be better ways
of doing that.MAIA: There are.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.644
And I apologize.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.951
I've agreed to pay
for both the computers

01:22.125 --> 01:24.475
and for the glass,
and I promise,

01:24.649 --> 01:27.043
this will never happen again.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.827
ADRIAN:Okay.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.742
Thank you, Maia.MAIA:
Thank you.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.401
[door opens, closes]So, what do we think?

01:38.663 --> 01:39.490
Fire her.

01:39.664 --> 01:40.796
No, no.What?

01:40.970 --> 01:42.319
I agree.BARRY:
We fired Alan North

01:42.493 --> 01:44.191
last month
for the identical drug charge.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.845
Not identical. He was using.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.238
That was never proved.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.240
This is just holding,
and Maia's never had

01:50.414 --> 01:52.024
any other issues.JULIUS:
Actually, that's not true.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.114
She was arrested
two years ago.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.463
For her father's crimes.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.334
But then she was found
not guilty.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.814
But don't we have
to be consistent?

01:58.988 --> 02:02.383
I argued against
firing Alan North

02:02.557 --> 02:04.820
for his drug arrest,
but I was overruled

02:04.994 --> 02:07.910
because we agreed
there's zero tolerance.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.607
Zero tolerance
for using, not for...

02:09.781 --> 02:11.914
I don't think we ever agreed
on that distinction.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.394
It's a huge distinction.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.309
[overlapping arguing]Wait. Wait.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.442
Wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Wait. Wait.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.357
We will review all the
evidence against Maia

02:20.531 --> 02:22.403
and then consider
suspending her for a week.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.753
So we're just gonna
let this slide?

02:24.927 --> 02:26.450
We're not gonna let it slide.We're not letting it slide.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.539
I know how this works.Just saying due diligence.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.193
BARRY: We kick it
down the road

02:30.367 --> 02:31.934
so we can bury it.No.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.893
We will come back in four
days, and we will vote.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.505
Everybody will be heard.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.811
Okay?BARRY: Okay.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.726
So, you coming with me?

02:41.900 --> 02:43.685
To tell Maia?No, to the noon meeting.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.470
Oh, your leftie rebellion?

02:46.644 --> 02:48.864
Mm, trust me, Liz,
you'll be impressed.

02:49.038 --> 02:52.084
I-I've had my fill
of left-wing anger.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.871
Yeah, well,
this is different.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.439
All right, let me
think about it.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.317
Should I close the door?

03:07.491 --> 03:09.493
[chuckles softly]

03:11.539 --> 03:13.367
Am I fucked?

03:13.541 --> 03:15.847
Wow, Maia. All grown up.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.936
No, you are not fucked.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.636
Boseman is doing the bare
minimum to discard of this.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.855
Drug test and a
standard investigation.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.857
A drug test?Yeah. Standard.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.904
But you have the
votes, so don't worry.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.863
Uh, things will be back
to normal in four days.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.517
[sighs]

03:34.692 --> 03:36.564
I'm so sorry
about all of this, Diane.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.175
No, no, no. You should've had
some supervision with Blum.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.872
That was my mistake.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.961
Well, it was an education.[chuckles]

03:44.528 --> 03:46.400
That's an odd couple.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.272
MAIA:
I know. They've been spending
a lot of time together.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.580
I think Julius is helping
her out with some legal issue.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.669
No, don't walk back
your pro-life argument.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.540
That's why they want you
for a federal judgeship.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.977
You don't think
it's too controversial?

03:59.151 --> 04:00.936
It's controversial here
because everybody's pro-choice,

04:01.110 --> 04:03.199
but you're at the
Historical Law Society.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.940
They're like the Federalist
Society Version Two.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.376
They want true believers.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.944
So I should just bring it up,
abortion?

04:09.118 --> 04:11.294
No, you bring up
your biography.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.688
The dog whistles.
You have 12 kids.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.994
Six.Whatever. And you're Catholic,

04:16.168 --> 04:18.258
and you live that
whole philosophy.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.607
What's that mean?

04:19.781 --> 04:21.870
Mass once a week
and a disabled son.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.655
Seriously?
I should just bring that up?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.222
Are you kidding me?
They'll eat that up.

04:26.396 --> 04:29.399
Julius, this is
Stockholm syndrome here.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.096
You've been here
with liberals so long

04:31.271 --> 04:32.620
you don't know what you should
be humblebragging about.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.013
Aren't you one
of those liberals?Sure.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.712
But my dad poisoned me.
He made politics chess,

04:37.886 --> 04:40.367
so it was more important to
win than to make life better.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.891
[laughs] You're a funny bird.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.501
Let's start again.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.199
When they ask you about your
family, what do you say?

04:47.374 --> 04:49.332
Well, as the father
of six children,

04:49.506 --> 04:51.900
one of them
with muscular dystrophy,

04:52.074 --> 04:54.511
I'm well aware
of the problems of family,

04:54.685 --> 04:57.819
and that's one of the reasons
I supported Donald Trump.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.690
Trump is down in the suburbs,

04:59.864 --> 05:02.389
but his evangelical,
rural support is strong

05:02.563 --> 05:05.000
and unlikely to decrease
given his court appointments

05:05.174 --> 05:06.436
and grip
on the right-wing media.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.438
If you turn to chart three,

05:08.612 --> 05:10.266
you'll see
that looking ahead to 2020,

05:10.440 --> 05:12.834
we need to change our focus.

05:13.008 --> 05:16.751
Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.841
Trump won the 2016 election

05:20.015 --> 05:21.799
because of these...

05:21.973 --> 05:25.977
79,646 votes.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.719
That's all it took to get him
the 46 electoral votes

05:28.893 --> 05:30.242
that put him in the White House.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.723
He lost the popular vote
by almost three million.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.422
So shouldn't we, in fact,
change Valerie's goal?

05:35.596 --> 05:38.294
What do you mean?Well,

05:38.468 --> 05:40.340
she challenged us to find a way

05:40.514 --> 05:43.952
to shave nine points off
of Trump's approval rating.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.128
But isn't that too broad?

05:46.302 --> 05:49.784
Shouldn't we just focus
on these needed votes?

05:49.958 --> 05:51.481
Should we check
with Valerie first?

05:51.655 --> 05:54.397
Um, she left it to us.RACHELLE:
So, let's do it.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.138
WOMAN:
Can I make a suggestion?

05:56.312 --> 05:58.053
Go for it.Isabella Burns.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.360
I'm working
with social media innovators,

06:00.534 --> 06:02.971
trying to follow tastes
across the country.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.582
And if you want
to sway 79,000 votes

06:05.756 --> 06:08.368
in Michigan, Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania,

06:08.542 --> 06:11.109
you need to swiftboat
a pop star.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.894
Swiftboat?

06:13.068 --> 06:15.331
As in Taylor Swift.
She came out for a candidate,

06:15.505 --> 06:17.377
and within 24 hours,

06:17.551 --> 06:21.076
65,000 new young voters
registered.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.904
By Election Day, there were
half a million new voters.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.776
So we need an influencer who
matters in these three states.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.778
And who might that be?

06:27.952 --> 06:29.214
RACHELLE:
We also need an influencer

06:29.389 --> 06:30.912
we can influence.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.740
Diane.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.749
Sounds like you already
have somebody in mind?

06:41.923 --> 06:43.272
Well, yes.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.795
One of your clients.

06:44.969 --> 06:45.927
Uh-oh.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.189
ISABELLA:
The country star,

06:47.363 --> 06:48.930
Sabrina Wynne.

06:49.104 --> 06:52.107
Her Q score is 56 or better
in these three states.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.675
Especially among
18 to 32-year-olds.

06:54.849 --> 06:58.722
Oh. So you all discussed this
before we got here?

06:58.896 --> 07:01.421
We went through
our client lists. You won.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.206
[ringtone playing]

07:07.252 --> 07:09.690
It's my day off.
This better be good.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.518
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a moment?

07:11.692 --> 07:12.954
I need some advice.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.172
How did
the disciplinary hearing go?

07:14.346 --> 07:15.696
Good, I think.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.045
I mean, they want
to give me a drug test.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.916
I've-I've never done one before.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.702
Do I have to worry
about a false positive?

07:21.876 --> 07:25.662
You know, from, like,
a-a lemon poppy seed muffin?

07:25.836 --> 07:28.448
No. Poppy seeds are
in such low quantities,

07:28.622 --> 07:30.754
it won't matter.
Everything should be fine.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.234
Just don't get arrested again.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.802
But for how long does a, uh,

07:34.976 --> 07:36.978
drug test flag
something like poppy seeds

07:37.152 --> 07:38.327
in your system?LUCCA: Ah.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.937
A week at the most.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.417
You know, they found drugs
in your car, Maia.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.897
It's not like you diddrugs.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.420
I'm so relieved.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.074
I feel like I want
to get blackout drunk.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.597
I need a drink, too.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.077
We just came
from a "mommy and me" class.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.340
MAIA: Oh, God.Yeah, we had to clap and sing

07:51.514 --> 07:53.385
and shake tambourines.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.779

somebody would
pay attention to you?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.502
[gasps] It's okay.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.678
She's off the phone now.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.159
It's cold outside.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.552
You should put a
scarf around him.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.988
He doesn't like scarves.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.337
Did he tell you that?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.817
When you get home,

08:33.991 --> 08:35.297
you should give him
Tylenol right away

08:35.471 --> 08:36.690
so he doesn't get a cold.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
Yeah, that's not how
Tylenol works.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.651
I'm guessing that you haven't
been a nanny for very long.

08:43.740 --> 08:48.005
I found him at Whole Foods
near the bulk peanuts.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.225
I like peanuts.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.575
Is that a joke?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.491
Okay, strange baby.

08:55.665 --> 08:59.060
Let's go.
Time to sell you on eBay.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.282
Do you know who that woman was?

09:04.456 --> 09:05.675
No.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.416
Did she come here

09:07.590 --> 09:09.766
with that baby?

09:09.940 --> 09:11.812
Yes. Look, I-I'm not sure what
I'm dealing with here,

09:11.986 --> 09:13.814
but it's a woman who says
she isn't the nanny,

09:13.988 --> 09:15.990
but she's African-American,
and the baby is white.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.645
Now, this is not racist.
I'm just concerned be...

09:18.819 --> 09:20.560
Oh, sh-she's looking
at me right now.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.387
Oh, my God.She said something
about drugs,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.954
about how her
friend has drugs

09:24.128 --> 09:25.652
in her car, and I just...
I always told myself

09:25.826 --> 09:27.436
it's always better
to be safe than sorry.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.481
Are you fucking kidding me?Uh, she's about 30 years old,

09:29.656 --> 09:32.354
dressed in baggy clothes, fancy
sneakers. Oh, and she told me

09:32.528 --> 09:34.182
she found the baby
at a Whole Foods. Thank you.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.705
[camera clicks]Um, excuse me,
I think you should wait

09:35.879 --> 09:37.141
until the police come.Ma'am,

09:37.315 --> 09:38.578
you need to get a fucking grip.

09:38.752 --> 09:39.927
Okay, don't swear.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.450
I have your license number,

09:41.624 --> 09:42.973
and I gave the police
your description.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.367
Jesus.You are not leaving
with this baby.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.282
With my baby?
Yes, I fucking am.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.544
He's not your baby.Don't!

09:48.718 --> 09:50.285
Get your hands off my stroller.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.722
Okay, help!
She's trying to take a baby!Lady...

09:52.896 --> 09:54.985
Can you stop? Stop.If you don't get the
fuck away from my car,

09:55.159 --> 09:56.770
I'm gonna take you down...Help!

09:56.944 --> 09:58.946

I've known quite a few judges

11:47.924 --> 11:49.404

11:49.578 --> 11:52.799
I understand how important
your work is,

how important it is

11:55.802 --> 11:58.239
of liberal judges legislating
from the bench.

11:58.413 --> 12:01.024
I've been a congregant

How is that consistent

12:33.753 --> 12:35.015
Fantastic job.Thank you.

You didn't like them?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.064

Some of them were... expensive.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.417

should've warned you.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.855

you some PAC money.

What's wrong?

14:35.570 --> 14:36.484
Okay, so...

14:36.658 --> 14:38.268
what is it?

14:38.442 --> 14:42.142
Uh, okay, so this is
gonna sound bad, but...

14:42.316 --> 14:43.795
I was wondering how long

14:43.970 --> 14:45.449
something will stay
in your system

14:45.623 --> 14:48.148
for it to be detected

the poppy seeds?

14:52.326 --> 14:53.675
[quietly]:
No.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.807
What drugs?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.941
Fentanyl.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.770
Fentanyl?

15:03.032 --> 15:04.338
How did you...

15:04.512 --> 15:06.209
Uh, Blum, he...

15:06.383 --> 15:09.473
he gave me
a fentanyl lollipop to try.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.999
And you tried it?Mm-hmm. I'd never
done drugs before,

15:13.173 --> 15:15.001
ever, and, uh...

15:16.654 --> 15:19.440
I wanted to see
what it would be like.

15:20.658 --> 15:21.833
Okay.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.183
So...

15:23.357 --> 15:25.402
it depends on how
much you took.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.492
Mm-hmm.Usually it metabolizes
in one and a half days,

15:28.666 --> 15:30.538
but it could take
up to five days.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.932
How long ago since
you took it?Four days ago.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.238

for a drug test,

15:35.412 --> 15:37.327

here to serve.

[chuckles]

18:19.272 --> 18:21.535
Uh, please, sit.

18:21.709 --> 18:25.147
So, we keep track
of mentions on social media.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.541
This was just posted today.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.457
It's obviously photoshopped,
but a lot of the discussion's

18:30.631 --> 18:33.155
about Sabrina really being
there in Charlottesville.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.939
SABRINA: They call
themselves Wynners.DIANE: Who does?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.289
These fans on
the alt-right.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.117
They think she's
their Aryan savior.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.640
Where's this coming from?Some conspiracy theorist

18:39.814 --> 18:42.382
on 4chan who
calls himself P-Anon.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.732
SABRINA: He supposedly
has all this information

18:44.906 --> 18:46.821
on the coming
civil war.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.171
He says I'll be married
off to Donald Trump Jr.,

18:49.345 --> 18:52.043
who will rule for
the next 50 years.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.524
And you want to sue him?NATE: Well, no,
he's anonymous.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.439
I mean, who would we sue?DIANE:
You'll still make

18:56.613 --> 18:58.398
a statement with this suit.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.487
You'll come out
as against the alt-right

19:00.661 --> 19:02.097
and neo-Nazis.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.839
No. We are committed
to staying neutral.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.624
Neutral with regards
to Nazis?

19:07.798 --> 19:09.713
Look...

19:09.887 --> 19:12.977
I-I know this is hard
for people to understand,

19:13.152 --> 19:16.764
but music, to me, is
bigger than politics.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.027
It's my whole life.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.247
But if you bring music
down to politics,

19:21.421 --> 19:23.466
that is all
that people see.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.252
And the ugly thing
about right now is:

19:26.426 --> 19:27.949
beauty is secondary.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.690
Politics is everything.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.388
Families break apart
because of politics.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.347
Paintings are
about politics.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.044
TV shows and jokes,

19:36.218 --> 19:38.351
poems, comic books.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.309
I always promised myself,

19:40.483 --> 19:42.616
no matter how much
money I'd lose,

19:42.790 --> 19:45.314
to never let my music
be used for anything

19:45.488 --> 19:47.011
except as music.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.144
So no statements,

19:49.318 --> 19:51.320
even about
alt-right assholes.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.585
Then... what wouldyou
like us to do?

19:55.759 --> 19:57.108
NATE: One of
Sabrina's fan sites

19:57.283 --> 19:59.459
has reprinted this photo
and called on Sabrina

19:59.633 --> 20:01.678
to condemn the alt-right.
We want you

20:01.852 --> 20:04.942
to send a cease-and-desist
order to that site.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.031
Oh, well, uh, that
would be a mistake, Sabrina.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.209
Why?Well, doing that
would make it seem

20:10.383 --> 20:12.298
like you support
the alt-right.

leave us for better paying jobs.

than white people

42:26.500 --> 42:27.980
I'm not surprised.

42:28.154 --> 42:29.982
Look at the clients
they're going after.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.636
Right, this is not just Chumhum.

42:31.810 --> 42:32.985
When's the last police brutality
case we took on?

42:33.159 --> 42:34.769
LEAH:
And Jenna's office.

42:34.943 --> 42:36.771
They took it from her
and give it to Maia.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.120
Wait a minute. She only got
that office temporarily.

42:38.294 --> 42:39.687
Why are you defending them?

42:39.861 --> 42:41.297
That's right.
Marissa is taking your job.

42:41.471 --> 42:42.908
LEAH:
Oh, I know for a fact

42:43.082 --> 42:44.605
that all the white associates
are going

42:44.779 --> 42:46.694
to Marissa with their cases
and not you.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.653
ROSALYN:
And if I have to jump six feet
to get the same thing

42:48.827 --> 42:50.785
you have to jump two feet for--
well, then that's racism.

42:50.959 --> 42:52.570
[chatter continues]

42:52.744 --> 42:54.397
Has anyone seen Marissa?

42:58.010 --> 42:59.620
Probably busy.

42:59.794 --> 43:01.448
But Jay is here.

43:03.276 --> 43:05.191
Thank you.

43:05.365 --> 43:07.846
LEAH:
That's who got Jenna's office.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.936
Trust fund baby kicked her out.

43:11.110 --> 43:14.026
[loud chatter continues]

43:19.466 --> 43:21.207
[crying]:
She was happy.

43:21.381 --> 43:23.078
People didn't know, or the ones
who did, didn't care.

43:23.252 --> 43:25.733
What's going on?

43:25.907 --> 43:27.822
Sabrina has a sister
who's transitioning.

43:27.996 --> 43:30.216
The alt-right came
out against her.

43:30.390 --> 43:32.131
SABRINA:
They said she's demented,

43:32.305 --> 43:33.959
perverted, castrated.

43:34.133 --> 43:35.482
They posted her photo
everywhere.

43:35.656 --> 43:38.267
Who, who did?Someone called P-Anon.

43:38.441 --> 43:40.574
SABRINA:
They spray-painted her house,
"Move or die."

43:40.748 --> 43:43.664
I don't know if I'm more scared
someone will kill her,

43:43.838 --> 43:45.971
or she'll kill herself.

43:46.145 --> 43:47.276
Sabrina wants to make
a statement.

43:47.450 --> 43:50.149
I want to get everyone out
to vote.

43:50.323 --> 43:51.629
You two were right.

43:51.803 --> 43:54.066
You can't stay neutral.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.763
No.

43:55.937 --> 43:58.287
LIZ:
Rachelle.

43:59.811 --> 44:01.334
This was you, wasn't it?

44:01.508 --> 44:02.944
Going after Sabrina's
trans sister?

44:03.118 --> 44:04.250
Why? Did it work?

44:04.424 --> 44:05.904
It devastated her.

44:06.078 --> 44:07.470
Is that what you wanted?

44:07.645 --> 44:08.907
No, but is she
making a statement?

44:09.081 --> 44:10.648
Yes, she's disgusted.

44:12.562 --> 44:14.129
It worked!
Sabrina's speaking out.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.870
[cheering]

44:16.044 --> 44:18.438
You put those words
in P-Anon's mouth?

44:18.612 --> 44:20.266
Of course I did.
That was the whole point.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.181
You smeared her trans sister.

44:22.355 --> 44:24.444
We had to get Sabrina to commit.

44:24.618 --> 44:25.967
The alt-right would've
done it if we didn't.

44:26.141 --> 44:28.361
But they didn't.RACHELLE: Yet. Diane.

44:28.535 --> 44:31.146
We said up front:
do what works.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.626
Well, this worked.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.802
Sabrina's gonna get
200,000 kids to register.

44:34.976 --> 44:36.195
And in all the right states.

44:36.369 --> 44:38.414
This is good.

44:38.588 --> 44:40.634
You did good.

44:46.901 --> 44:48.250
[overlapping chatter]

44:48.424 --> 44:49.469
ADRIAN:
All right, all right.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.079
Okay. All right.
All right!

44:51.253 --> 44:53.778
All right. All right.

44:53.952 --> 44:56.476
We cannot address any of these
concerns if we can't hear you.

44:56.650 --> 44:58.217
Kevin, you're first.
What?

44:58.391 --> 45:00.654
Why are so many
of the new hires white?

45:00.828 --> 45:03.570
We made offers to a number
of African-American graduates

45:03.744 --> 45:05.790
who decided they didn't want
to move to Chicago.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.748
That's just what happened.But the new white associates

45:07.922 --> 45:09.228
are earning more
than the black ones.

45:09.402 --> 45:11.926
Salaries are driven
by seniority, Lucca.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.798
Now, this year,
all of our white recruits

45:13.972 --> 45:16.148
happen to have
more experience.

45:16.322 --> 45:17.976
The white attorneys favor
the white staff.

45:18.150 --> 45:19.717
Look at the investigators;
the white lawyers

45:19.891 --> 45:21.936
always ask for Marissa.BARRY: Okay,
we'll look into that.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.938
ADRIAN:
We will look into it.Anything else?

45:24.112 --> 45:25.461
What about what
happened with Maia?

45:25.635 --> 45:28.029
Okay. Hold on. Let's not
overwhelm the partners.

45:28.203 --> 45:30.031
No. If this is about the spare
office, we gave that office

45:30.205 --> 45:31.772
to Maia Rindell
because of the work...

45:31.946 --> 45:34.732
No. This is about
her drug arrest.
Right.

45:34.906 --> 45:38.300
KEVIN:
Alan North got fired
after one arrest.

45:38.474 --> 45:41.826
Maia Rindell gets arrested, goes
to trial, gets arrested again,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.045
and you gave her
a one-week suspension.

45:44.219 --> 45:45.743
Every case is different, Kevin.ROSALYN: She's white.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.006
Whoa. Whoa. W-W-Whoa.Isn't that what's different?

45:48.180 --> 45:49.790
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.BARRY: Okay, wait.
We haven't decided

45:49.964 --> 45:51.487
whether to suspend her.

45:51.661 --> 45:52.619
We were fact-finding.

45:52.793 --> 45:54.621
And we're voting
on it today.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.101
KEVIN:
Something's changed.

45:56.275 --> 45:57.406
We all feel it.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.582
We appreciate
all your opinions.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.934
We will consider everything
you've said very carefully,

46:03.108 --> 46:06.241
and get back to you
as soon as we can.

46:06.415 --> 46:07.939
Are you sticking
with them?

46:08.113 --> 46:09.157
Yes.

46:09.331 --> 46:10.506
Me, too.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.117
Why?

46:12.291 --> 46:13.901
Ah, they are effective.

46:14.075 --> 46:15.468
Yep.

46:15.642 --> 46:16.904
KEVIN: Fuck you.TOMMY: What the fuck did I do?

46:17.078 --> 46:18.210
Like you don't know.

46:18.384 --> 46:20.038
Kevin, can you not
just talk to me?

46:20.212 --> 46:21.039
KEVIN:
Do you honestly think
that you should be

46:21.213 --> 46:22.344
making more money than me?

46:22.518 --> 46:23.563
TOMMY:
That's not my decision.

46:23.737 --> 46:25.739
[indistinct arguing]

46:36.881 --> 46:38.883
[loud, overlapping chatter]

46:40.710 --> 46:42.234
ADRIAN:
All right.

46:42.408 --> 46:45.324
So we said we would reconvene,
we are reconvening.

46:45.498 --> 46:47.413
Here we are.

46:47.587 --> 46:49.328
What's going on?A number of people think

46:49.502 --> 46:51.939
we're being inconsistent
with our punishment for Maia.

46:52.113 --> 46:53.767
So we're voting
on it right now.

46:53.941 --> 46:56.335
I say we do the same thing
that we did to Alan North.

46:56.509 --> 46:58.772
We relieve her of her position
with cause.

46:58.946 --> 47:00.730
Wait a minute.
I thought we decided

47:00.905 --> 47:02.341
on a punishment for Maia.

47:02.515 --> 47:04.996
A one-week suspension.

47:05.170 --> 47:07.085
No, we said we were waiting
for her drug test.

47:07.259 --> 47:08.303
And? And what
was her drug test?

47:08.477 --> 47:10.001
It came back clean.

47:10.175 --> 47:11.829
No, it came
back inconclusive.

47:12.003 --> 47:14.919
I say we vote. Now. Our Rules
of Corporate Governance

47:15.093 --> 47:17.182
call for it to be
put to a vote

47:17.356 --> 47:18.923
whether an associate's
employment is to be terminated.

47:19.097 --> 47:21.403
I vote for firing.

47:21.577 --> 47:25.146
Wait. We have no concrete proof
that she used those drugs.

47:25.320 --> 47:27.279
At a minimum, Diane,
she showed bad judgment.

47:27.453 --> 47:29.324
To carry around a box
of illegally obtained

47:29.498 --> 47:32.023
Schedule C drugs in her car?

47:32.197 --> 47:33.938
DIANE:
Well, in that case I should be
removed for cause, as well.

47:34.112 --> 47:37.767
I carried illegally obtained
psilocybin,

47:37.942 --> 47:39.900
a Schedule C drug, in my car.

47:40.074 --> 47:43.382
If we're being consistent,
then I should be fired.

47:43.556 --> 47:44.687
You're a partner, Diane,
you have protections

47:44.862 --> 47:46.994
an associate doesn't.

47:47.168 --> 47:48.996
And, I recall,
you voted against Alan.

47:49.170 --> 47:50.955
Let's vote now.

47:51.129 --> 47:53.305
But, Adrian,
why are we rushing this?

47:53.479 --> 47:54.828
We had a consortium
of associates complain

47:55.002 --> 47:56.264
about disparities in pay,

47:56.438 --> 47:58.527
disparities in handling
infractions, Diane.

47:58.701 --> 48:00.703
They think the disparities
were based on race.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.618
But they aren't.BARRY: I said that, too.

48:02.792 --> 48:05.708
But the difference is,
I didn't believe it.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.449
Well, then why didn't you say
something at the time?[overlapping arguing]

48:07.623 --> 48:09.321
This is a young woman's life
for God's sake.

48:09.495 --> 48:11.018
ADRIAN:
Okay. Okay, everybody. Okay.

48:11.192 --> 48:12.977
Let's not try and settle
all our racial issues

48:13.151 --> 48:15.675
in this disciplinary committee.

48:15.849 --> 48:17.459
BARRY:Okay.

48:17.633 --> 48:20.375
Should we suspend Maia Rindell
for a week,

48:20.549 --> 48:22.203
or should we be consistent?

48:22.377 --> 48:23.813
Oh, come on.You're right.

48:23.988 --> 48:26.512
Strike that. Or should we
fire her with cause?

48:26.686 --> 48:30.559
All those in favor
of suspension...

48:32.561 --> 48:35.086
Five for suspension.

48:35.260 --> 48:39.133
All those in favor of removing
Maia from her position...

48:48.838 --> 48:52.059
Six for removal.

48:53.191 --> 48:54.757
Adrian.
