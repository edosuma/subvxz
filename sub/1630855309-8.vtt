WEBVTT

00:09.458 --> 00:12.500
So, anyone got any fun plans tonight?

00:12.500 --> 00:16.791
Oh, I was gonna take a Klonopin
and go to bed at 5:00 p.m.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.500
Same, but 3:00 p.m.

00:18.500 --> 00:23.875
And I plan to examine my nude body
in the mirror until I cry myself to sleep.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.083
Ah, so, no. No fun plans.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.500
- Hey!
- A-ahem!

00:27.500 --> 00:30.958
Attention, everyone!
Party at my house tonight.

00:30.958 --> 00:34.041
It's BYOB. Bring Your Own Bussy.

00:35.125 --> 00:38.791
I'm gonna bring extra bussy
because someone always forgets.

00:38.791 --> 00:41.416
Oh-oh-oh! I have the perfect playlist.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.250
It's all Morrissey,
but not his music, no, no.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.041
It's just him complaining
about immigration.

00:47.041 --> 00:52.875
Oh, sorry. Everyone's invited except
you downers at this sad table right here.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.333
What? Why not?

00:54.333 --> 00:58.916
Nobody wants to be anxious, depressed,
or ashamed at a party, darling.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.416
They wanna drink and fuck

01:00.416 --> 01:03.291
and not hang out
with you wimpy piss stains.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.708
- Party! Party!
- Wow. Tight exit.

01:05.708 --> 01:09.166
Oh God, it's like secondary school
all over again.

01:09.166 --> 01:13.375
It's not fair. Why don't we ever
get invited to their cool parties?

01:13.375 --> 01:15.416
I know. We got all the good drugs.

01:15.416 --> 01:18.791
It's because we're not cool.
We're losers. We suck eggs.

01:18.791 --> 01:22.041
Oh, come on, Lionel.
I don't think you suck eggs.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.500
You, uh... You don't?

01:23.500 --> 01:27.125
No, I think you're very cool...
in your own way.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.666
- You think I'm cool?
- In your own way.

01:29.666 --> 01:33.666
Right, yes. I'm fu--
I'm fucking cool, daddy-o.

01:33.666 --> 01:37.791
In fact, you know what?
I should throw my own party.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.916
Yes... [stammers] ...hoes?

01:39.916 --> 01:42.625
You hoes will attend, right?

01:42.625 --> 01:43.541
- Well...
- Uh...

01:43.541 --> 01:44.958
- I, uh...
- I'll check my schedule.

01:44.958 --> 01:49.291
Hey, man. Sorry about the party,
but can you hold this for me real quick?

01:49.291 --> 01:50.875
Oh, yeah, sure--

01:50.875 --> 01:55.208
Ha! I bought an extra lunch
just to slap this one in your face.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.375
Now you smell like lunch.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.666
God. Why do you guys
have to be such assholes?

02:00.666 --> 02:03.708
You heard Mona. We're cool,
and well, he's a fucking freak.

02:03.708 --> 02:06.333
The weak and the weird need to be pruned.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.458
Well, for your information,
the weak and the weird

02:08.458 --> 02:10.333
are throwing their own party tonight...

02:10.333 --> 02:12.708
...and you're not invited.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.208
- Oh, no! Did you hear that, Connie?
- Well, shoot.

02:15.208 --> 02:18.583
Lionel, I'm so upset.
Could you please hold my other tray?

02:18.583 --> 02:20.458
Oh...

02:20.458 --> 02:22.500
All right. Let's go buy some more lunches.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.750
<i>♪ That's just the way you make me feel ♪</i>

02:26.750 --> 02:30.291

02:58.250 --> 03:03.041
As you know, our client, Sal,
has wanted a truck for some time now.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.416
What are we gonna do?

03:05.416 --> 03:07.166
Don't look at me, monkey-man.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.916
I'm a Need Demon,
not a "Really-Really-Want" Demon.

03:10.916 --> 03:13.791
Well, sweet Sal
loves that truck desperately.

03:13.791 --> 03:15.375
And I don't normally do this,

03:15.375 --> 03:18.125
but I think it's time
we bring in the big guns.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.166
Okay, so what's the fucking problem?

03:21.166 --> 03:23.375
Your client wants a truck?
Get him a fucking truck.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.083
If only it were that easy.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.583
Why? This guy Sal
got bad credit or something?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.750
Well, no.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.291
- Uh, Sal is four years old.
- What?

03:31.291 --> 03:33.333
And the truck in question is...

03:33.333 --> 03:34.500
A fucking toy?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.291
That's right. It's a Tonka.

03:36.291 --> 03:40.000
I worked with human quagmire
Robert McNamara

03:40.000 --> 03:42.916
for seven years during the Vietnam War,

03:42.916 --> 03:45.250
and you brought me in
for a fucking toy truck?

03:45.250 --> 03:46.583
Who's Robert McNamara?

03:46.583 --> 03:50.458
I don't have a clue, but it sounds like
he's some sort of human quagmire.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.375
Just ask the kid's parents for the truck.
Case closed.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.375
Flanny, allow me.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.000
Oh, yes, Mr. DNApe. Here you are.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.875
Sal has an extremely rare genetic variant
called KCNB1.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.416
Enhance. You see, humans
are made up of billions of cells.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.416
Enhance. And in each of these cells
are chromosomes.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.000
Enhance.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.458
Say "enhance" one more fucking time,

04:14.458 --> 04:16.666
and I'm gonna shove a banana
so far up your ass,

04:16.666 --> 04:18.416
you're gonna think you're a banana split.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.250
Right, well, uh, zoom in a little bit.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.583
One tiny little change
in one of Sal's genes

04:23.583 --> 04:25.333
has made Sal neurodiverse,

04:25.333 --> 04:28.791
causing him to be,
among other things, nonspeaking.

04:28.791 --> 04:33.083
So we can't just ask for the truck,
and we've tried everything else.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.416
- We've thrown tantrums.
- Shitty idea.

04:35.416 --> 04:38.916
- Hugged Sal's moms for hours on end.
- Even shittier.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.583
We even tried extortion.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.916
But no one in the house noticed
when the Nespresso pods went missing.

04:43.916 --> 04:48.041
That idea is so shitty,
I need toilet paper to wipe my ears.

04:48.041 --> 04:52.208
Please, Petra, we're at our wits' end.
You have to help us.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.708
- Ambition is all we've got left.
- Okay. Jesus. Just stop!

04:55.708 --> 04:59.166
I'll do the truck job,
but I'm doing it my way. Alone.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.291
Uh, bu-bu-but you can't handle
a case like Sal's by yourself.

05:02.291 --> 05:05.916
In the immortal words
of another ambitious gremlin I know,

05:05.916 --> 05:07.875
"Don't believe me? Just watch."

05:07.875 --> 05:10.166
Was she talking about Robert McNamara?

05:10.166 --> 05:13.583
No, I believe she was referring
to Bruno Mars.

05:13.583 --> 05:15.000
Fuckin' dipshits.

05:16.083 --> 05:20.583
Oh my God. My mom sent me
another goddamn Facebook post.

05:20.583 --> 05:24.125
Seriously? More inspiration porn
from mommy dearest?

05:24.125 --> 05:27.083
 "The only disability
is a bad attitude."

05:27.083 --> 05:29.958
- Ugh, barf.
- Goddamn ableist bullshit.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.958
You know,
I'm never gonna be enough for her.

05:31.958 --> 05:36.375
After 30 years trying to "fix you"
with all those damn doctors and therapies,

05:36.375 --> 05:37.833
your mom still doesn't get it.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.958
Ugh, I gotta take this.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.208
It's Traci and Olivia.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.250
Oh, that cute motherfucker's parents?

05:43.250 --> 05:46.416
<i>- Alice, we have some great news.</i>
- Did you win the appeal?

05:46.416 --> 05:50.458
<i>Yes! Wow. Wait, how did you know?
Did Dev tell you already?</i>

05:50.458 --> 05:53.416
Yeah, we've been, uh, emailing.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.583
Did someone mention Dev?

05:55.583 --> 05:59.916
That hunk lawyer with the long eyelashes
and ass for days?

05:59.916 --> 06:02.541
- Connie, what the fuck are you wearing?
- I'm a sex genie.

06:02.541 --> 06:05.750
I pop out when someone rubs
their magic damp.

06:05.750 --> 06:08.083
- Alice!
- What? Dev's hot.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.625
She can hate and be horny
at the same time.

06:10.625 --> 06:14.125
Look at Pol Pot.
He was horny for genocide.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.750
<i>We're just so excited that Sal
and the other disabled students</i>

06:16.750 --> 06:18.375
<i>get to stay with their class.</i>

06:18.375 --> 06:19.375
<i>It's huge.</i>

06:19.375 --> 06:22.958
- That's amazing news.
- Oh, come on! It's the bare minimum.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.541
<i>And we wanted to invite you
over to dinner to celebrate.</i>

06:25.541 --> 06:28.750
Are these people gonna have a party
every time one little good thing happens?

06:28.750 --> 06:30.875
- It's nice to celebrate.
- Ugh!

06:30.875 --> 06:34.416
The world is nonstop diarrhea,
and they're celebrating a fart.

06:34.416 --> 06:36.333
I celebrate every fart.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.916
They make my genie pants go floof.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.666
<i>Dev is coming tonight too,</i>

06:40.666 --> 06:43.833
<i>but maybe you already knew that
since you two are pen pals, hmm?</i>

06:43.833 --> 06:45.416
More like penis pals.

06:45.416 --> 06:48.833
- Yeah. Maybe I should go.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

06:48.833 --> 06:51.833
Oh, yeah, Connie? Like the last time
she went on a date. Was that fun?

06:51.833 --> 06:53.500
- That does it, Rochelle.
- Get back!

06:53.500 --> 06:57.166
It doesn't have to be a date
to catch some dick.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.291
Connie!

06:58.291 --> 07:00.125
There. Lady, you're going.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.583
Okay, okay. I am in.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.833
- Text me the address.
- Don't go, Alice!

07:04.833 --> 07:09.041
Hey. You be good in there
or I'm gonna turn you into some boots.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.041
I'm not afraid to skin a bitch.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.250
Jesus, look at that thing.

07:14.250 --> 07:18.000
That Tonka's got a badonka. Yeah!

07:18.000 --> 07:21.250
I totally get it now.
That is one fuckable truck.

07:22.416 --> 07:25.083
But, hey, kid, what about all of these?

07:25.083 --> 07:28.541
- You're right, you're right.
- Settling's
for the Southern District of New York.

07:28.541 --> 07:32.625
Eye on the prize. All right,
just spitballing here, but first idea.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.625
Let's just take the thing.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.500
No, Sal. It's <i>my</i> truck.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.833
Oh, don't be a dick.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.458
He just wants to vroom it
a couple of times.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.000
You're gonna take that, Sal?
Curb stomp this kid.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.791
Take a shit in his Huggies.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.416
Sal pushed me.

07:52.416 --> 07:54.458
That was self-defense.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.375
Hey, hey, hey, hey now.
Are-- Are you okay, Jacob?

07:57.375 --> 08:02.541
Sal took my truck
and then he hit me.

08:02.541 --> 08:06.375
Oh, please. Don't be such a Karen, Jacob.
He barely touched you.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.333
Sal, we do not hit.

08:10.708 --> 08:13.750
All right, all right, this might be
a little harder than I thought,

08:13.750 --> 08:17.500
but, hey, if I can keep America
in a pointless war for ten years,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.333
I can get you a fuckin' toy.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.708
Hey, I'd love a tour after I ejaculate,
if that's all right?

08:23.708 --> 08:27.208
Appetizers! Hors d'oeuvres, yes!
Crudités! Yes.

08:27.208 --> 08:30.708
Okay, everyone, keys in this bowl
if you need a designated driver.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.291
Keys in this bowl
if you wanna swap sex partners, okay?

08:33.291 --> 08:37.000
I, of course, had my keys copied
because I would like both.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.875
Oh, and there's a punch bowl of K-Y
by the pool.

08:39.875 --> 08:42.916
Please don't forget to lubricate properly.

08:42.916 --> 08:47.333
Wow, Mona, I had no idea
you lived in the lap of luxury.

08:47.333 --> 08:50.083
Oh, are you not rich, Emmy?

08:50.083 --> 08:53.333
Well, I'm currently living
under the kitchen sink at the office

08:53.333 --> 08:55.166
because crabs took over my apartment.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.625
Oh, that's quite sad.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.791
Whoa, is that lube for free?

08:58.791 --> 09:01.625
Of course, sweetie. I'm rich.

09:01.625 --> 09:06.000
Now, people, get slippery
and enjoy yourself

09:06.000 --> 09:07.750
because tonight, we--

09:07.750 --> 09:10.333
- Fuck!
- What's wrong?

09:10.333 --> 09:11.583
Tito just canceled,

09:11.583 --> 09:15.041
and Kitty texted she was never planning
on coming in the first place.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.458
W-Why did Tito cancel?

09:16.458 --> 09:19.208
Well, apparently, she doesn't like
driving at night.

09:19.208 --> 09:23.333
- Doesn't she have wings?
- Oh, Montel, who was I kidding?

09:23.333 --> 09:27.000
I really am a freako weirdo loser.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.375
Quit your bellyaching.
There's someone now.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.916
- Hello! Please don't leave.
- Hi, Lionel.

09:31.916 --> 09:35.750
I didn't see any cars out front.
Is no one coming?

09:35.750 --> 09:38.958
Oh, Schmitty from Pity, I feel so shitty.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.958
My party is a total bust.

09:40.958 --> 09:44.291
Oh, you poor guy. My heart breaks for you.

09:44.291 --> 09:48.000
You really put it all out there,
and nobody wanted it.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.791
Jesus, Schmitty. Your pity is not helping.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.708
No, no, Schmitty's right.

09:52.708 --> 09:56.583
It seems the harder I try,
the less everybody likes me.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.250
Yeah, that's the thing
about being a loser.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.333
There's only one thing to do.
Drown your sorrows.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.166
<i>♪ Da na na na na na na ♪</i>

10:04.166 --> 10:05.083
Tequila.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.000
Oh, put it away!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.041
It's just booze, Lionel.

10:08.041 --> 10:13.375
No, no! In my culture,
tequila is the Forbidden Elixir.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.958
It makes you do such shameful things.

10:15.958 --> 10:17.791
Honey, what have you got to lose?

10:17.791 --> 10:19.958
It's not like people
can like you any less.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.333
Ooh!

10:28.875 --> 10:30.500
Oh!

10:30.500 --> 10:34.041
It really hits you fast
when you only weigh 38 kilos.

10:35.625 --> 10:38.291
Oh my God, babe.
Sal hit a kid at school today.

10:38.291 --> 10:41.250
- Really?
- Goddamn heart of a tiger, this one.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.416
We literally just fought
to keep him at that school,

10:43.416 --> 10:45.083
and now he's fighting kids there?

10:45.083 --> 10:48.958
Not fighting, exactly.
He just-- He hit Jacob.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.375
Oh, Jacob? Yeah, nobody likes Jacob.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.958
But, still, Sal, you shouldn't
be hitting people for no reason.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.416
But there was a reason. A really good one.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.041
Tell 'em, Sal. What words you got?

11:00.041 --> 11:02.833
Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay, "want."
Uh-huh, "want."

11:02.833 --> 11:04.875
Okay, what do you want, buddy?

11:04.875 --> 11:07.250
Are you hungry?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.250
There's popcorn with nutritional yeast
and <i>furikake</i> on the stove.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.250
The fuck did popcorn ever do to you?

11:13.250 --> 11:14.875
Sal, what's going on?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.250
Lady, can't you see he doesn't want

11:17.250 --> 11:19.750
a yeast infection
from your <i>bukkake</i> snacks?

11:19.750 --> 11:23.416
He wants you to take a goddamn second
and listen to him.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.125
Okay, okay, okay.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.958
I can see you're having
a lot of feelings right now.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.666
Just one, bitch.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.291
Sal! Okay, buddy.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.291
You definitely need a nap
before your therapies.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.666
This is total bullshit.

11:37.666 --> 11:41.166
It is not your fault
that they don't wanna learn Salanese.

11:41.791 --> 11:45.875
Ugh, kid, you're killing me
with this sad Sundance bullshit.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.250
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

11:48.250 --> 11:51.125
You can't give up on me.
We may be down, but we're not out.

11:51.125 --> 11:55.208
You gotta have a little hope.
Aw, shit. Goddammit!

11:55.208 --> 11:58.625
All right, listen. I might know someone
who could maybe help us.

11:58.625 --> 12:02.250
But if I do this for you,
and I'm not saying that I will,

12:02.250 --> 12:04.333
you're gonna have to let me
play with the truck.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.041
What? It's a cool fucking truck.

So who lives in your pool house?

12:18.791 --> 12:21.000
Oh, my very sick grandmother.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.250
Is she looking for a roommate?

12:25.250 --> 12:27.625
Uh, if you don't mind living
with a sex offender,

12:27.625 --> 12:28.833
it's all yours, darling.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.083
I mean, it beats living under a sink.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.250
I-Is something burning?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.708
<i>- ♪ Da da da da da da! ♪</i>
- Oh, shit. What the hell?

12:35.708 --> 12:39.041
Don't tell anyone,
but I spiked the lube, dude.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.416
But Rick, alcohol is flammable.

12:41.416 --> 12:44.083
Everyone, stop humping! Stop humping!

12:44.083 --> 12:45.791
Rick spiked the lube!

12:45.791 --> 12:48.125
Oh, yeah, right, Maury. Such a kidder.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.125
Oh, no! Oh, no, he's right!

12:50.125 --> 12:51.708
He's not a kidder!

12:51.708 --> 12:53.916
Oh, this is burning in a bad way.

12:53.916 --> 12:55.625
Quick, quick! Jump-- Jump in the pool!

12:55.625 --> 12:58.416
Uh-oh, I spiked the pool too, baby.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.708
Look! The roof! The roof is ablaze.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.708
Well, at least the pool house
is still standing.

13:07.708 --> 13:08.791
Oh, no.

13:08.791 --> 13:11.250
Farewell, sick Grandmother.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.791
I guess now heaven has another pervert.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.916
Huh.

13:16.916 --> 13:19.458
Shit, man. Where we gonna party now?

13:19.458 --> 13:21.791
My drugs pill just kicked in.

13:21.791 --> 13:25.208
Well, we know someone
who's having a party, don't we, Maury?

13:25.208 --> 13:29.041
Hey, hey, everybody.
Let's go crash Lionel's loser party.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.000
That's okay. You guys go ahead.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.541
Yeah, we're gonna stay here

13:33.541 --> 13:36.250
and look at Mona's
dead grandma's ghost tits.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.166
Oh no, I don't like it if you're into it.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.083
Oh, fuck. Look, I dropped all my pens,
right in front of you.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.458
Petra, can I help you with something?

13:51.458 --> 13:53.916
I don't need your fuckin' help, okay?

13:54.416 --> 13:57.333
But since you asked,
I have an opportunity for you

13:57.333 --> 13:59.416
that involves me getting something I need.

13:59.416 --> 14:03.583
Hold on.
Are you asking me for a favor?

14:03.583 --> 14:06.583
No, I don't need nothing from nobody.

14:06.583 --> 14:10.166
But... there is this cool kid
I'm working with,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.375
and if you could give him
some of your hope mumbo jumbo...

14:12.375 --> 14:13.291
Uh-huh.

14:13.291 --> 14:18.625
...at the end of the day, there's a scenario
where you might have access to a truck.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.583
Okay.

14:19.583 --> 14:23.291
Oh, fuck this and fuck you
if you're gonna say "okay" like that.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.875
Petra, stop. If you want my help,
why don't you just ask for it?

14:26.875 --> 14:30.541
Because I don't like it.
But I gotta do it for this kid.

14:30.541 --> 14:31.791
All right.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.666
- But only because you asked.
- Great.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.875
And technically, I did not ask.
You offered.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.291
And yes, I'm recording this.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.208
Mama Maury?

14:41.208 --> 14:43.375

What are you doing here?

14:43.375 --> 14:45.125

14:45.125 --> 14:48.125
What's up is we're crashing
your party, dork.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.291
Yeah, and there's nothing
you can do about it.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.500
- Magnificent.
-"Magnificent"?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.791
Yes, yes, come in, come in.

14:54.791 --> 14:59.625
I know how you lot like to ejaculate,
and you may do so wherever you please,

14:59.625 --> 15:02.541
for I am inebriated.

15:02.541 --> 15:04.291
Um, okay?

15:04.291 --> 15:07.958
Whoa, Lionel, your place is huge.
Do you live here alone?

15:07.958 --> 15:11.625
Yeah, of course, of course.
Before this evening, everyone hated me.

15:11.625 --> 15:15.166
But now look, my home is full of revelers,

15:15.166 --> 15:18.541
and Rick is spiking the baptismal font.

15:18.541 --> 15:20.750
I do not learn from my mistakes.

15:20.750 --> 15:25.875
Oh! A house fire and a dead pervert
can't stop our party, people.

15:25.875 --> 15:30.958
So, ladies and gentlemen,
once again, tonight we--

15:30.958 --> 15:33.250
Fuck, in a church.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.541
Aw, what's up, Sal?

15:38.541 --> 15:40.000
Oh.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.125
You wanna go to the playground.
Maybe after your therapies. Okay, bud?

15:44.208 --> 15:46.625
No. We don't wanna go
to the goddamn playground.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.208
I mean, maybe. Later.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.750
But first, Sal, my man, this is Hope.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.916
Hey there, Sal.

15:52.916 --> 15:56.291
She's here to make you feel
like you can go on living or whatever.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.541
Humans are such fuckin' babies.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.541
Not you. I know you're a big boy.
But humans in general.

16:01.541 --> 16:05.291
Okay, Big Boy.
We're gonna manifest that truck.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.750
-"Manifest"?
- Now, here's the plan, baby.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.708
When you go into your therapies,

16:09.708 --> 16:13.041
I want you to stay focused
on that truck you want so bad.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.041
And to help you do that,
Petra's gonna sing you a song.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.333
I am?

16:17.333 --> 16:18.916
- I fuckin' hate singing.
- Petra.

16:18.916 --> 16:20.916
All right.

16:20.916 --> 16:24.166
If 58,000 young men
can die in the Vietnam War,

16:24.166 --> 16:25.375

with a flaxseed protein crust.

17:37.416 --> 17:40.833
- I'm sorry. It's straight-up gross.
- It's healthy.

17:40.833 --> 17:44.416

and go get some actual dessert after this.

Tequila, man.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.291
Oh, man, tequila makes me wanna suck dick.

18:32.291 --> 18:35.208
Or maybe sucking dick
makes me thirsty for tequila?

18:35.208 --> 18:38.500
Tequila and dick, man.
That's chocolate and peanut butter.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.291
Okay, I think maybe
everyone should go easy on the tequila.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.250
- Boo!
- Fuck you, party pooper.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.000
Yeah, stop defecating
on our fiesta, you ho.

Señor Frog's energy, and I don't need it.

they're blowing smoke
up each other's asses.

19:07.666 --> 19:10.875
- Perfect time to demand a toy.
- You can do this, baby.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.958
Mm-hmm.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.875
Hey, my love. Would you like some pie?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.416
Ooh, see?

19:17.416 --> 19:20.250
Even Sal knows what's up
with the desserts in this house.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.208
Oh, he-- He probably wants tubby time.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.500
Make these <i>fakakta</i> women
understand you, kiddo.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.000
I'm listening, Sal. I'm listening.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.166
Okay, he's signing "wants."
You want... What do you want Sal?

19:34.375 --> 19:37.166
- A block?
- No, a-- A toy, maybe?

19:37.166 --> 19:38.833
Come on, kid.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.666
Be the truck you wanna see in your house.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.333
- You're honking. Oh, you're a goose!
- You wanna go to Canada?

19:50.333 --> 19:52.625
I think he's a car.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.250
Yes, yes, a car honks. You're a car.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.791
Oh, okay.
Oh, no, you're bigger than a car.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.250
- A crossover?
- A midsize SUV?

19:59.250 --> 20:00.333
A Sprinter van!

20:00.333 --> 20:02.666
No, it's a truck. Duh!

20:02.666 --> 20:05.791
- He was pointing to one in the car today.
- You want a toy truck?

20:05.791 --> 20:07.750
Better believe it's a truck!

20:07.750 --> 20:09.458
Yes! He wants a toy truck.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.666
- Yeah!
- We did it!

20:10.666 --> 20:12.291
Choke on it, haters!

20:12.291 --> 20:15.000
Our son wants a truck, and he told us.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.708
Fuck that neurologist
and his bullshit benchmarks.

20:17.708 --> 20:21.208
See, Sal? You can do anything
with the right attitude.

20:21.208 --> 20:25.500
Because "the only disability
is a bad attitude," right, Alice?

20:25.500 --> 20:28.625
- Oh, man.
- It's your mom all over again.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.750
- Yeah, it is.
- Rochelle, stop.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.916
We can't let them do to Sal
what your mom did to you.

20:34.916 --> 20:37.083
This family needs this moment.

20:37.083 --> 20:40.375
Alice, it is okay
to celebrate small victories.

20:40.375 --> 20:43.750
- Oh God, you're gonna go to high school.
- Maybe even college.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.916
We could be on <i>The Amazing Race</i> together
as mother and son.

20:46.916 --> 20:50.250
Listen to them.
The expectations. The pressure.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.208
- The disappointment.
- Stop it.

20:52.791 --> 20:54.083
- Stop what?
- Tell them.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.708
Don't do it, girl.
Please. Don't take this from them.

20:57.708 --> 21:02.458
I... I just think this is
a lot of pressure to put on him.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.666
- Excuse me?
- Sis, chill.

21:04.666 --> 21:07.708
- No, please, continue.
- I should not have said anything.

21:07.708 --> 21:11.333
Are you scared
we'd be disappointed in him?

21:11.333 --> 21:14.041
- Because we could never be.
- Sal is perfect as he is.

21:14.041 --> 21:17.375
Yeah, you say that,
but you still expect him to do more.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.583
Maybe more than he even wants to do.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.666
And when he fails, and he will fail,

21:22.666 --> 21:26.208
he will feel like shit,
and he's going to hate you.

21:28.916 --> 21:29.875
Oh, fuck.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.500
- Um... "Fuck"?
- Uh...

21:31.500 --> 21:34.125
Did he just say his first word?

21:34.125 --> 21:36.458
Don't look at me.
He didn't hear that fucking word from me.

21:36.458 --> 21:40.083
Are we allowed to celebrate <i>that,</i> Alice?
Is that okay with you?

21:40.083 --> 21:43.625
I'm so sorry.
I knew I should not have said anything.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.875
No, it's fine. [chuckles] We get it.
Our son's gonna hate us.

21:46.875 --> 21:51.000
- Oh, shit, Rochelle. What did we do?
- We told them the truth.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
For the record,
I fuckin' hate you as a Hate Worm.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.333
Let's blow this joint, Hope. Hope?

21:56.333 --> 21:59.541
Oh, that bitch is gone.
Here one moment, gone the next.

21:59.541 --> 22:04.958
- That's her whole gestalt, baby.
- Well, my whole gestalt is "eat my ass."

22:05.625 --> 22:08.333
All right, drunks, sluts,
and drunken sluts,

22:08.333 --> 22:10.666
you don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

22:10.666 --> 22:11.666
Oh!

22:11.666 --> 22:15.291
Emmy, I said "drunken sluts."
Let's go. Come on.

22:15.291 --> 22:19.291
Actually, Lionel said I can crash here
until I get my life together,

22:19.291 --> 22:22.166
so, yeah, I'll be staying here forever.

22:22.166 --> 22:27.333
Ooh! Bye, darling. You tell that freak
he throws one fuck of a party.

22:27.333 --> 22:30.083
And where is said freak?

22:30.666 --> 22:32.958
Lionel, where are you?

22:32.958 --> 22:34.375
Everyone's going home.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.291
Ooh! Ahh!

22:36.291 --> 22:38.000
Lionel?

22:41.333 --> 22:43.833
- Montel!
- It's not what it smells like.

22:43.833 --> 22:47.375
So my parents aren't having
a mushy threesome with my mentor?

22:47.375 --> 22:50.625
Oh, no. Yeah. Well, then, no,
it's exactly what it smells like.

22:50.625 --> 22:53.500
Oh, you poor kid.
This is gonna be a core memory.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.583
Ugh, the wetness!

22:55.583 --> 23:00.416
A sexual betrayal by your mentor
tends to be foundational.

23:00.416 --> 23:02.375
I gotta go scoop out my eyeballs.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.750
Montel, wait!

23:04.750 --> 23:06.916
I thought you wanted us to get along.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.291
You basically begged us to do this.

23:09.291 --> 23:14.000
Speaking of begging,
can I pleeease get in on your orgy?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.666
- Uh... no.
- No way.

23:15.666 --> 23:18.791
Eh, my penis doesn't work anyway.
It has too many holes.

23:18.791 --> 23:22.416
- What? Like a-- Like a flute?
- No, more like a colander.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.083
Okay, now I'm intrigued.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.666
- So...
- Yeah.

23:27.666 --> 23:31.458
- Uh, do you still wanna get some dessert?
- Are you serious?

23:31.458 --> 23:34.750
Alice, my nephew finally advocated
for something he wanted,

23:34.750 --> 23:37.916
and you somehow
made his whole family feel terrible.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.291
I was just trying to protect Sal.

23:40.291 --> 23:43.625
I get that, I do,
but it was still a dick move.

23:43.625 --> 23:44.833
Dev, come on.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.958
Yeah, I think I-- I think I should go.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.583
- Uh, I'll see you around.
- Ah, shit.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.375
Nuh-uh. Don't let that asshole
make you feel bad.

23:52.375 --> 23:55.166
- Yeah, fuck him.
- We don't need his judgment.

23:55.166 --> 23:58.125
- Fuck everybody.
- We don't need nothing from nobody.

23:58.125 --> 24:01.208
- Yeah, we've got Postmates.
- And a vibrator.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.583
Rochelle, I may never
leave the house again.

24:04.333 --> 24:08.708
So, yeah, Sal's mom ordered it on Amazon,
and they delivered it that night.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.708
Wow, Petra. I can't believe it.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.041
You got Sal his truck

24:13.041 --> 24:15.666
with no help whatsoever
from nobody at all.

24:15.666 --> 24:18.750
Hey, there's no shame
in asking for help if you need it.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.041
Fortunately, I did not.

24:21.041 --> 24:22.708
What happened to you? You look like shit.

24:22.708 --> 24:26.208
I don't know. I could say this.
I know I didn't fuck anyone last night.

24:26.208 --> 24:29.250
Connie, could you say that?
You didn't fuck anyone last night?

24:29.250 --> 24:33.875
I took a Xanax and fell asleep watching
the Netflix Original Series <i>Lupin.</i>

24:33.875 --> 24:37.458
Oh, good. Maurice, Constance.
Morning, lovers.

24:37.458 --> 24:41.000
Eh, I wanted to make sure
you both got home all right.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.041
- Um, from what?
- My party last night.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.125
Oh, you had a party last night?

24:46.125 --> 24:49.833
Uh, yes, remember?
We all fornicated each other. No?

24:49.833 --> 24:52.208
Oh my God!
You two fucked the Wizard?

24:52.208 --> 24:54.916
- What?!
- No! Uh... Uh-uh, I watched <i>Lupin.</i>

24:54.916 --> 24:57.208
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Sure you did.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.625
Oh, I see. You two are ashamed.

25:00.625 --> 25:04.416
Afraid your stock as cool individuals
will take a hit

25:04.416 --> 25:06.958
after making sweet love to me.

25:08.625 --> 25:12.541
Everyone! I have an announcement to make.

25:12.541 --> 25:15.583
- Oh, he's gonna tell everyone, isn't he?
- Yup.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.916
- And we, uh...
- We wanna fuck him again?

25:18.916 --> 25:20.583
- Yup.
- Big time.
