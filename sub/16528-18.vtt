00:00.034 --> 00:02.868
ADULT ADAM:<i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> there was one TV doctor</i>

00:02.870 --> 00:04.703
<i> that stood out</i>
<i> more than the rest...</i>

00:04.705 --> 00:06.205
<i> Doogie Howser, MD.</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:07.740
<i> He was a genius</i>
<i> teenage physician</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:11.110
<i> who operated on, and won...</i>
<i> America's hearts.</i>

00:11.112 --> 00:13.946
<i> And there was no bigger</i>
<i> Doogie-head than my brother,</i>

00:13.948 --> 00:17.049
<i> who realized</i>
<i> his calling in life was</i>
<i> to be a doctor, too.</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:19.585
Can we turn this off
and make out now?
Shh!

00:19.587 --> 00:23.322
Doogie's changing
how old, stuffy doctors
look at medicine.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.824
ADULT ADAM:<i> Which is exactly</i>
<i> what Barry wanted to do,</i>

00:25.826 --> 00:26.992
<i> so he gave it a shot.</i>

00:26.994 --> 00:28.627
Doctoring!
Oh, no! Why?!

00:28.629 --> 00:29.928
Just checking
your reflexes.

00:29.930 --> 00:33.499
Patient lacks muscle response
and also seems
highly agitated.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.800
Damn right I'm agitated!

00:34.802 --> 00:37.002
You just hit my knee
with a hammer!

00:37.004 --> 00:38.704
(SNORING)

00:38.706 --> 00:39.471
(GAGS)

00:39.473 --> 00:40.406
Oh, God!
What's happening?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.741
Patient's throat
seems red and inflamed,

00:42.743 --> 00:45.210
especially that dangly part
in the back.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.412
Stay away from me!

00:46.414 --> 00:50.249
Damn it! Come back
and get the remote
I just threw at you!

00:51.652 --> 00:53.419
Aah! I just want
to sleep, moron!

00:53.421 --> 00:57.022
Patient appears to be
emotionally unstable
and also gassy.

00:57.024 --> 00:57.990
What the hell's
on your face?

00:57.992 --> 01:00.893
Looks fancy and expensive.
Who's buying you this crap?

01:00.895 --> 01:02.528
There's my little
Schmoopie Howser!

01:02.530 --> 01:04.263
Look what I got you
at the medical-supply
store today.

01:04.265 --> 01:08.100
Noice! Good to know
at least<i> someone</i> around here
supports my dream.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.870
Shame on you, Murray,
for not believing
in your future-doctor son.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.472
I just want
to get some sleep!

01:13.474 --> 01:14.373
Stop encouraging
the moron!

01:14.375 --> 01:17.242
No! That's my doctor recorder
I talk into for some reason!

01:17.244 --> 01:19.211
I just want to get
the damn tape!
Murray! That was expensive!

01:19.213 --> 01:21.814
I just want to get the tape!
Stop it! Get away!
Stop it!

01:21.816 --> 01:23.582
Okay, I've decided
I'm either gonna be

01:23.584 --> 01:27.553
a doctor for the Phillies
or the president's
personal brain surgeon.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.688
Hey, guys.
I heard the amazing news.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.157
That my idea
for Barry Goldberg
appreciation day

01:32.159 --> 01:33.692
has been approved
by the school board?

01:33.694 --> 01:34.993
I told you they said no.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.829
I'm referring to how
Lainey got accepted

01:36.831 --> 01:39.064
into the Savannah College
of Art and Design.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.732
I think Mr. Glascott
might be mistaken.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.734
No, it's right here
on official stationery.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.903
How is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.939
Well, I must have gotten in
this very second. Yay!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.640
No, this letter says
you got in over a month ago.

01:48.642 --> 01:52.111
That's impossible!
Lainey would never hide
something so big from me.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.245
Yes, that would be
a terrible betrayal

01:53.247 --> 01:56.815
that would rock the very
foundation of everything
that you hold dear.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.551
Read the room, dude.
Roger that.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.020
How could this happen?
We had a plan.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.388
You graduate
and take a year off,

02:03.390 --> 02:06.959
and then<i> I</i> graduate,
and you follow me
to the college of my choosing.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.594
I<i> never</i> officially agreed
to that.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.430
Okay, fine.
But you can't go to that
school without me

02:11.432 --> 02:13.132
and surround yourself
with all those fashion boys.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.834
Fashion boys?
Yeah, they're all
stylish and tan

02:15.836 --> 02:17.536
and love dancing
the night away
with each other.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.705
I really don't think
you have to worry about
fashion boys.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.873
This changes everything
between us.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.542
I guess it was my dream
and I just wanted
to give it a shot.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.744
Well, I don't want you
to give up your dream.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.212
Oh, baby.
Idea!

02:27.214 --> 02:28.447
I'll just go to
the medical school

02:28.449 --> 02:30.182
at the Savannah College
of Art and Design!

02:30.184 --> 02:32.084
I checked... They don't have
a pre-med program.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.519
Ugh! That school makes
no sense!

02:33.521 --> 02:36.221
Look, nothing's written
in stone.
I may not even go there.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.523
But you got a full
scholarship!

02:37.525 --> 02:39.124
You'd be a fool
not to attend!

02:39.126 --> 02:40.259
Not now!
Roger that.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.028
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I love you.
We'll talk about this later.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.096
Sure. We'll figure it out.

02:44.098 --> 02:48.000
Man, nothing...
And I mean nothing
survives long distance.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.970
How is this helping?
I get that a lot.
Toodles!

02:51.972 --> 02:53.405
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:53.407 --> 02:57.576
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:59.914 --> 03:00.812
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:00.814 --> 03:04.583
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:04.585 --> 03:06.919
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was March 15th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:06.921 --> 03:08.754
<i> and my dad was</i>
<i> coming home from work</i>

03:08.756 --> 03:10.923
<i> excited to see</i>
<i> his favorite child...</i>

03:10.925 --> 03:12.991
I'm home!
<i> ...our dog, Lucky.</i>

03:12.993 --> 03:15.427
There she is!
Oh, I love you.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.562
I love you, I love you.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.996
<i> And as the favorite</i>
<i> Goldberg child,</i>

03:17.998 --> 03:22.601
<i> Lucky got a lot of privileges</i>
<i> the rest of us didn't,</i>
<i> like free snacks.</i>

03:22.603 --> 03:23.502
Soft pretzels... Nice.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.838
Hey! I'm sorry.
Are you an adorable pooch?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.874
(LAUGHING)
I don't think you are.
Hands off.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.345
<i> She also got showered</i>
<i> with love and kisses</i>
<i> and whatever</i> this<i> is.</i>

03:33.347 --> 03:35.414
Come on!
This is the way I talk!

03:35.416 --> 03:38.483
I'm Lucky,
the Goldberg mascot!

03:38.485 --> 03:41.553
<i> My dad taught her tricks,</i>
<i> bought her outfits...</i>

03:41.555 --> 03:42.621
<i> Even a fancy dog bed.</i>

03:42.623 --> 03:44.489
<i> The rest of us...</i>
<i> Not so much.</i>

03:44.491 --> 03:45.657
Okay,
very important question...

03:45.659 --> 03:47.726
On one hand,
Florida has beaches,

03:47.728 --> 03:50.128
but on the other hand,
Georgia has peaches.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.565
So it's beaches
versus peaches.
See my predicament?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.766
What is this?
Why are you talking to me?

03:54.768 --> 03:57.603
For school. I'm trying
to decide between
Emory and Miami.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.471
They both have
awesome music programs.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.441
Oh! I can actually
help you with this.
Neither.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.577
You're telling me
you'll pony up
for a designer dog bed

04:05.579 --> 04:07.679
but not your own
daughter's future?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.914
Yes.
Oh, my god!

04:08.916 --> 04:09.648
(WHINES)
MURRAY: Ohh!

04:09.650 --> 04:14.152
Doesn't she look like
a handsome lady
from the 1850s?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.088
ERICA:
Guess what, nerd.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.956
The dog is definitely
dad's favorite.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.625
Oh, you saw Lucky's
new waterbed, huh?

04:19.627 --> 04:22.794
It's a waterbed?
<i> I</i> don't even have one!

04:22.796 --> 04:24.563
It's like he loves the dog
more than his own kids.

04:24.565 --> 04:28.500
I've tried to point it out
to him like a hundred times,
but he won't admit it.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.701
Well, it's time
I get him to.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.503
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my sister</i>
<i> cooked up a plan,</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:33.505
<i> Barry was searching</i>
<i> for answers.</i>

04:33.507 --> 04:36.642
Pops, you've lived
an impossibly long time.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.244
Tell me an old-timey story
that reassures me

04:39.246 --> 04:41.280
a long-distance relationship
can work.

04:41.282 --> 04:44.883
Well, I once dated
a Tunisian woman
named Marwa.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.985
We would swim
in the warm waters

04:46.987 --> 04:49.187
of the Mediterranean
during the day

04:49.189 --> 04:51.623
and become one
on the beach at night.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.391
So it<i> can</i> work.
It did...

04:52.393 --> 04:56.361
Until her father chased me
around an open-air bazaar
with a scimitar.

04:56.363 --> 04:59.898
Why did I go down
this incredibly long road
with you for nothing?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.066
I'll be honest with you,
kiddo...

05:01.068 --> 05:04.636
When I started that story,
I didn't remember
how it ended.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.370
I don't know
what I'm gonna do!

05:05.372 --> 05:09.041
Lainey was supposed to be
by my side my entire time
in medical school.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.943
See? That's the point
of my story!

05:11.945 --> 05:13.578
Love is unpredictable.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.547
Don't try to salvage
your stupid story.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.983
I have to figure out
how to be with the girl I love

05:17.985 --> 05:19.951
and go to medical school
at the same time!

05:19.953 --> 05:22.020
ADULT ADAM:<i> But then,</i>
<i> there he was...</i>

05:22.022 --> 05:24.756
<i> The man-boy that would</i>
<i> give barry the answer!</i>

05:24.758 --> 05:25.557
Unless...
No!

05:25.559 --> 05:30.262
Don't look at the boy surgeon
and get some<i> farkakte</i> idea.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.664
Nice chat, Pops.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.801
Mother, you relentlessly
and unrealistically

05:35.803 --> 05:37.836
support my dreams
more than anyone, right?

05:37.838 --> 05:38.403
Of course I do, pumpkin.

05:38.405 --> 05:42.441
Not to overstate it,
but I'd like to bottle you up
and sell you at Bergdorf's.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.043
That's why I need your help
to make sure I become

05:45.045 --> 05:47.279
a fully licensed
and accredited doctor

05:47.281 --> 05:48.613
before Lainey leaves
for college.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.416
Um, boopie? It takes<i> years</i>
to become a doctor.

05:51.418 --> 05:55.220
But Doogie's 16
and already does that thing
when he yells "clear!"

05:55.222 --> 05:56.621
Then shoots lightning
into some dude's heart.

05:56.623 --> 06:00.959
That sounds fun!
But you're still
just a boy in high school.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.662
Step 1... Take my GED,
graduate tomorrow.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.164
What's next?
Four years of pre-med
at college.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.000
I'll do it in six weeks.
Done. Next.
What else you got?

06:09.002 --> 06:12.371
Actual medical school,
which takes another
four years.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.005
I'll knock it out
in a month.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.708
Boom! Cutting out hearts
and playing God.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.876
But to be a cardiologist,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.978
you need to do
a residency at a hospital,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.980
and that's at least
another two years.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.682
I'll do it in two<i> days.</i>
Done!

06:23.684 --> 06:27.119
Where are my golf clubs?
Dr. Tasty's ready
to save lives.

06:27.121 --> 06:27.586
Honey, I love you,

06:27.588 --> 06:31.156
but even<i> I</i> don't believe
all that can happen
before Lainey leaves.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.158
This is so typical
of you...

06:33.160 --> 06:34.393
Never supporting
anything I do!

06:34.395 --> 06:38.163
Don't you say that!
I support<i> everything</i>
about you!

06:38.165 --> 06:39.431
Except this.
This is insane.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.366
I know!
This is hopeless!

06:41.368 --> 06:44.636
So if I got to choose between
being a regular-aged doctor

06:44.638 --> 06:46.705
and being with Lainey,
I choose her!

06:46.707 --> 06:48.039
Stop.
What are you saying?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.809
If it's between saving
millions with my doctoring

06:50.811 --> 06:52.277
or saving one
with my loving,

06:52.279 --> 06:53.512
then I choose
to let millions die.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.847
But I was looking forward
to letting my friends

06:55.849 --> 06:57.883
ramble on
about their boring sons,

06:57.885 --> 06:58.850
and when they asked me
about you,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.319
I'd smugly say,
"He's a doctor."
Not anymore.

07:01.321 --> 07:05.624
But I was gonna get
personalized license plates
that say "Doc's Mom"

07:05.626 --> 07:06.725
And steal
all your cream samples

07:06.727 --> 07:10.362
and bother you
on family vacations
when I find a weird bump!

07:10.364 --> 07:11.930
Not anymore.
Honey?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.331
Goodbye, tongue depressors.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.468
I guess I ate all those
popsicles for nothing.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.672
ADULT ADAM:<i> As Barry's plan</i>
<i> for his future</i>
<i> was losing steam,</i>

07:20.674 --> 07:22.707
<i> Erica heated things up</i>
<i> in the kitchen.</i>

07:22.709 --> 07:24.142
<i> Yep, she used</i>
<i> a single smoke alarm</i>

07:24.144 --> 07:27.879
(ALARM BEEPING)
<i> To prove that lucky</i>
<i> was our dad's favorite.</i>

07:27.881 --> 07:30.048
(MUTTERING) Fire.

07:30.050 --> 07:30.982
Fire!

07:30.984 --> 07:33.418
Come here, Lucky.
I gotcha.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.853
I'll rescue you,
my little princess!

07:34.855 --> 07:39.257
ADULT ADAM:<i> And so my dad</i>
<i> proved her point...</i>
<i> Insultingly quick.</i>

07:39.259 --> 07:40.425
I can't believe you, dude!

07:40.427 --> 07:41.993
How could you save
the dog over us?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.363
It's a dog! She doesn't
know from fire alarms!
You<i> do!</i>

07:45.365 --> 07:46.965
Just admit it...
Lucky's your favorite child.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.602
You're just upset
'cause I won't pay for some
fancy out-of-state school.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.671
No, I'm upset
because you don't care.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.740
If Lucky was going to college,
you'd be a hysterical mess!

07:55.742 --> 07:58.143
Don't be a moron.
There's no such thing
as dog college.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.145
What would she even study?
Frisbee catching?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.080
Please, Lucky hates Frisbee.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.114
Fine, tail chasing.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.483
Lucky doesn't
chase her tail!

08:04.485 --> 08:06.852
Duh! That's why
she'd take the class,
to learn.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.989
Okay! I'm sorry I introduced
dog college as a concept!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.023
My point is,
I'm moving out,

08:12.025 --> 08:15.260
and you haven't shown
a shred of emotion about it.

08:15.262 --> 08:15.861
Stop.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.862
Well, I feel sorry
for this dog,

08:16.864 --> 08:18.163
because she's stuck
in this crazy family!

08:18.165 --> 08:21.600
Let me tell you something.
This dog loves this house,
loves me,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.468
and isn't running off
anywhere.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.237
ADAM: (GASPS) Oh, no!
ERICA: Stop!

08:25.239 --> 08:26.371
Lucky! Come to Daddy!

08:26.373 --> 08:27.906
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As our dog was taking off,</i>

08:27.908 --> 08:30.509
<i> Barry's new career</i>
<i> was on the runway.</i>

08:30.511 --> 08:32.744
People of this house!

08:32.746 --> 08:35.947
Are you ready to witness
the future of fashion?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.616
What's with the getup,
Barry?

08:37.618 --> 08:39.317
I no longer respond
to "Barry."

08:39.319 --> 08:41.620
From now on,
I am the fashion designer

08:41.622 --> 08:44.122
known only as... Bare.

08:44.124 --> 08:44.856
Stop it right now.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.359
You're becoming a doctor,
end of story!

08:47.361 --> 08:50.629
Never! I am and forever
will be a fashion boy.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.031
And I must get my portfolio
together for Savannah.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.400
Bare has it all,
shirts, shorts, pants,

08:55.402 --> 08:57.969
also pants shorter
than normal pants.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.404
So... Shorts.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.171
Damn it!

09:00.173 --> 09:01.706
I'm ignoring that
and moving on.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.041
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)
I give you Bare...

09:03.043 --> 09:08.179
formal active wear
for going to a ball
or slam-dunking one.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.248
I'm a model!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.149
(SIGHS)

09:11.151 --> 09:13.251
Next,
we got Naked Rob.

09:13.253 --> 09:17.088
BareStyles is the
only clothing
this nudist will wear.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.623
It really breathes, bro.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.625
For the tiny man
who can live in a shoe,

09:20.627 --> 09:24.729
we got Andy Cogan
modeling the petite line.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.665
Aw, come on, dude!
I'm helping you!

09:26.667 --> 09:29.534
And finally,
we got Matthew Bradley

09:29.536 --> 09:31.970
showing off
our sportsedo.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.239
He shoots and scores...

09:35.208 --> 09:36.875
With the ladies.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.108
Oww!

09:37.110 --> 09:40.612
Okay, he's making
these poor boys
wear a bunch of schmattas.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.914
You got to
get involved now!

09:42.916 --> 09:44.616
(INHALES SHARPLY)

09:44.618 --> 09:46.284
(BLEEP) me.

09:47.321 --> 09:51.189
ADULT ADAM:
<i> We'd been all over Jenkintown,</i>
<i> and still no sign of Lucky.</i>

09:51.191 --> 09:55.760
Oh, damn it!
She lost her collar!
Now we'll never find her!

09:55.762 --> 09:57.495
Balls! I'm freaking out!

09:57.497 --> 09:58.797
This is your fault, Dad!

09:58.799 --> 10:00.865
Who ties a dog to the lid
of a garbage can?

10:00.867 --> 10:03.535
She was only out there
'cause you staged a fake fire

10:03.537 --> 10:05.971
and ruined
perfectly good fish sticks!

10:05.973 --> 10:07.005
None of this
would have even happened

10:07.007 --> 10:09.507
if you could just talk to
each other like normal people!

10:09.509 --> 10:11.776
I'm always willing
to talk about my feelings,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.445
unlike Closed Off Johnson
over here.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.214
You want feelings?
I love that damn dog!

10:16.216 --> 10:19.451
It never asks for anything,
never gives me any lip,

10:19.453 --> 10:22.554
and then when I come home,
she runs right up to me!

10:22.556 --> 10:24.723
Forgive me for not
charging into your arms

10:24.725 --> 10:26.091
as you shed
your swampy pants

10:26.093 --> 10:27.058
and head to
your disgusting chair.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.328
When you were a little girl,
you used to
run through the door

10:30.330 --> 10:32.130
into my arms
every time I came home,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.098
and that was
the best part of my day.

10:33.100 --> 10:37.802
(VOICE BREAKING)
And now that's gone too,
and my heart is broken!

10:37.804 --> 10:38.403
Oh, okay.
Yikes.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.940
But now you're leaving,
and it's so painful,
I can't stand it!

10:41.942 --> 10:43.274
Please make him stop.
I can't.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.278
I used to have a dog
that would sit by my side
and not leave,

10:47.280 --> 10:50.015
(SOFTLY)
and now she's gone, too.

10:50.017 --> 10:50.849
No! Don't cry-whisper!

10:50.851 --> 10:54.285
(WHISPERING) The only thing
that still loves me is gone.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.620
I'm so lonely.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.589
What have you done?
What have I done?

10:57.591 --> 10:59.958
(WEAKLY) I'm scared!
I'm scared to be alone!

10:59.960 --> 11:00.725
We need to find the dog!

11:00.727 --> 11:03.261
Maybe she went in the
dumpster for food scraps.

11:03.263 --> 11:03.695
Is she in there?

11:03.697 --> 11:07.632
Of course she's not!
She's a foot high
and doesn't have thumbs!

11:07.634 --> 11:08.633
Aah!

11:08.635 --> 11:09.634
ADULT ADAM:
<i> I may have hurt my hand,</i>

11:09.636 --> 11:13.405
<i> but Lainey was in for</i>
<i> a way more painful surprise.</i>

11:13.407 --> 11:15.240
Hello, Lainey Lewis.
Aah!

11:15.242 --> 11:17.075
Not a fan of seat belts,
I see.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.810
I was just
getting situated.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.811
We need to talk
about your plans

11:19.813 --> 11:24.015
to drag my boy
to the Deep South to
become a fashionista.

11:24.017 --> 11:24.916
How is this on me?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.451
I've always
supported his dreams,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.086
even when they've been
highly questionable,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.921
like when he wanted to be
a yo-yo champion

11:29.923 --> 11:31.790
or start a shelter
for wayward lizards.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.291
Look, I know
you love Barry...

11:33.293 --> 11:35.827
Not as much as me,
but close.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.128
And we share him now,

11:37.130 --> 11:40.331
and both have to think
about what's best for him.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.066
I get it.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.801
I really do want
what's best for him,

11:42.803 --> 11:46.371
even if what's best for him...
Doesn't include me.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.338
Then talk to him.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.642
The future of Dr. Goldberg
is in your hands.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.111
Otherwise, he's Bare.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.846
ADULT ADAM:
<i> After my mom made her point,</i>

11:54.848 --> 11:57.048
(CREAKING)
<i> she made a very dramatic exit.</i>

11:57.050 --> 11:58.817
Just got to squeeze... Aah!

11:58.819 --> 11:59.818
Stupid tiny teenage car.

11:59.820 --> 12:04.289
<i> Meanwhile, my sister and I</i>
<i> were hoping to end our drama</i>
<i> and find Lucky.</i>

12:04.291 --> 12:05.523
I don't know
what hurts worse,

12:05.525 --> 12:06.991
my shattered heart
or my broken hand.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.794
Forget the fact your fingers
look like mangled sausages.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.429
We need to find Lucky
so we don't have to

12:11.431 --> 12:13.965
watch Dad cry-whisper
over her ever again.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.633
Yeah, I don't think
it was about the dog.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.902
He was crying over you.
Don't you say that.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.104
It's true.
You're his Lucky.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.505
You didn't think
he cared about you leaving,

12:20.507 --> 12:25.310
but he, like, loves you
so hard that
he's... He's broken.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.811
He's a broken man!

12:26.813 --> 12:27.112
I know!

12:27.114 --> 12:30.949
He was so vulnerable
and raw and real
and devastated over me.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.717
But this is
what you wanted.

12:32.719 --> 12:33.918
No. No way.
It's too much.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.255
We got to find Lucky
so that Dad can
put his walls back up

12:37.257 --> 12:38.823
and close himself off
forever.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.525
Let's put up those fliers,
and fast.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.026
Move, move, move!

12:42.028 --> 12:42.494
Stop, stop, stop!

12:42.496 --> 12:45.730
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But as fate would have it,</i>
<i> Lucky found us.</i>

12:45.732 --> 12:47.799
<i> All we had to do was grab her.</i>

12:47.801 --> 12:49.667
Shh. No sudden movements.

12:49.669 --> 12:53.304
She'll think we're
playing and bolt
if we try to grab her.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.038
(WHINES)

12:54.040 --> 12:56.574
I got this.
Hey, Lucky, Lucky.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.575
That's a good girl.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.677
I got a doggie treat for...

12:59.679 --> 13:00.945
Oh, balls!
She's running!

13:00.947 --> 13:02.747
Don't worry.
I got this.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.116
Ohh! My leg not good!

13:05.118 --> 13:08.286
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out finding Lucky</i>
<i> was a painful experience.</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:11.689
<i> Meanwhile, Lainey had</i>
<i> some hurt in store for Barry.</i>

13:11.691 --> 13:12.957
'Sup?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.494
Oh, my God!
What is on your
body right now?

13:16.496 --> 13:16.895
Oh, this?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.663
Just my favorite
Rangers jersey, sweats,
hat, and scarf.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.965
But they're the sworn enemy
of the Broad Street Bullies.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.435
That's like saying
New York is a better city
than Philadelphia.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.570
Ooh. Honestly, it is.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.071
Whoa, whoa.
What are you saying?

13:27.073 --> 13:28.139
I guess I hate Philly.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.207
What?
And cheesesteaks.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.341
(GASPS)
And Rocky Balboa.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.310
No!
I also hate rap
and BMX biking

13:32.312 --> 13:35.079
and Macho Man Randy Savage, as
well as Jean-Claude Van Damme.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.248
You must've hit your head.
You're not thinking straight.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.583
Speaking of
stupid karate people,

13:38.585 --> 13:41.953
I also hate Chuck Norris,
and Bruce Lee is a wuss!

13:41.955 --> 13:43.488
Don't! Just don't!

13:43.490 --> 13:45.156
Whatever. I'm off
to watch<i> Breakin' 1,</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:46.624
which is far superior
to<i> Breakin' 2.</i>

13:46.626 --> 13:49.561
Oh, God, no!<i> Breakin' 2</i>
is the<i> Electric Boogaloo!</i>

13:49.563 --> 13:51.362
What happened
to the woman I love?

13:51.364 --> 13:52.497
Hey, if you don't like it,

13:52.499 --> 13:56.067
I guess you'll just
have to break up with me.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.769
You leave me no choice.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.772
Lainey,
if it makes you happy...

14:00.774 --> 14:03.808
I will completely change
everything about myself.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.711
The things I cherish,
what defines who I am

14:06.713 --> 14:09.981
are meaningless
if you don't like them, too.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.150
That means
no more Flavor Flav,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.452
and hit the bricks,
Ron Hextall!

14:14.454 --> 14:15.987
Damn it!
Why are you so sweet?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.690
All that matters
is me and you.

14:18.692 --> 14:19.791
Okay, fine!
I admit it.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.393
The Flyers are superior
to the Rangers...
Yes!

14:22.395 --> 14:23.728
<i> Breakin' 2</i> is rad...
Yes!

14:23.730 --> 14:26.231
And Van Damme's
oiled-up, shredded body

14:26.233 --> 14:28.333
and insane flexibility
are sick.

14:28.335 --> 14:28.867
Come back to me, baby!

14:28.869 --> 14:31.603
I just didn't want
to stand in the way
of you being a doctor,

14:31.605 --> 14:33.771
but I couldn't bear
to break up with you myself,

14:33.773 --> 14:35.106
so I wanted you
to do it for me.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.475
But screw it.
I can't lose you next year.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.476
Come to Savannah with me.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.711
I don't care
what your mother thinks.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.913
Wait. What does she
have to do with this?

14:41.915 --> 14:43.248
Did she
put you up to this?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.949
No. Kinda.
I don't know.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.518
She got in my head,
and my car.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.454
(GROWLING) Mmnh!

14:49.689 --> 14:51.356
Mmnh!

14:51.358 --> 14:53.091
Mmnh!

14:53.093 --> 14:53.992
Mmnh!

14:53.994 --> 14:57.095
Must... Release...
Extreme... Rage!

14:57.097 --> 15:00.164
ADULT ADAM:<i> And so</i>
<i> the rage was released.</i>

15:00.166 --> 15:00.565
Barry, wait.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.767
I know you're mad, but please
keep my name out of it.

15:02.769 --> 15:03.735
Of course, my love.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.837
Lainey told me
everything, Mom!

15:05.839 --> 15:08.139
Come on, dude.
You didn't even
make it two seconds.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.040
Everybody stop yelling

15:09.042 --> 15:12.844
and have a calming hunk
of my homemade banana bread.

15:12.846 --> 15:13.745
Come on.
No!

15:13.747 --> 15:17.215
Warm, moist dessert bread
will not stop our rage.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.383
In fact, Lainey agrees.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.318
I'm going with her
to Savannah, Tennessee.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.620
It's in Georgia.
Ugh. Really?

15:22.622 --> 15:23.421
Doesn't matter.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.657
In fact, I will never
break up with Lainey.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.426
The only person I'm gonna
break up with is you.

15:28.428 --> 15:28.960
So what are you saying?

15:28.962 --> 15:32.397
You're just gonna get married
and have kids
and never see me?

15:32.399 --> 15:33.398
Is that what you wish on me?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.200
More than anything!
Lainey and I
will have six boys.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.435
Wait. What?
And three girls,

15:37.437 --> 15:38.903
and they'll be
strangers to you.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.204
Nine kids?
Are you crazy?

15:40.206 --> 15:40.939
Shh! This doesn't
concern you.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.409
You will only be known
as the weird blond lady
who lives down the street,

15:44.411 --> 15:48.479
and you will never,
ever be allowed
in our one-bedroom condo.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.747
Whoa! Nine kids in one room?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.949
The complex has
a large common area.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.218
Don't worry, Lainey.
Gam Gam will babysit
whenever you want.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.355
Okay, we're getting just
a smidge ahead of ourselves.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.489
We have to!

15:58.491 --> 15:59.757
Just listen to me.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.193
Lainey, we had
all these big plans.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.330
Now everything's
falling apart.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.131
¶¶

16:09.069 --> 16:10.568
ADULT ADAM:
<i> With his future in shambles,</i>

16:10.570 --> 16:12.203
<i> Barry did what</i>
<i> any reasonable man would...</i>

16:12.205 --> 16:14.939
<i> Lock himself in a closet.</i>
Barry,
please come out of there.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.608
BARRY: No! I'm staying in here
until I've figured out

16:17.610 --> 16:18.576
what I'm supposed to do
with my life.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.746
If you only would've agreed
to the nine kids,
he wouldn't be in there.

16:21.748 --> 16:22.914
This is your fault.
Hey!

16:22.916 --> 16:24.615
You're the one
forcing him to be a doctor

16:24.617 --> 16:26.417
to make your friends
feel like losers.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.952
(LAUGHS) Duh. Yeah.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.054
Uh, good news,
we found the dog.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.423
Bad news,
all of Adam is broken.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.758
So much hurting, Mama!

16:33.760 --> 16:34.625
Oh, my God!
Call the hospital!

16:34.627 --> 16:37.829
This is the worst
medical emergency
the world has ever seen!

16:37.831 --> 16:39.597
There's
a medical emergency?

16:39.599 --> 16:40.398
Clear a path!

16:40.400 --> 16:42.100
Where's the pain,
little bro?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.502
In my arm and my leg.

16:44.771 --> 16:45.970
Do you know
what you're doing?

16:45.972 --> 16:48.106
Don't worry.
I'll fix everything.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.540
You didn't
answer the question!

16:49.542 --> 16:51.376
Lainey, I need
50cc of ice, stat!

16:51.378 --> 16:53.745
I don't know
how much that is,
but I'm on it.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.847
BARRY: Come on, fast!
I need it fast!

16:55.849 --> 16:56.981
Mom, I need
a morphine drip.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.884
If you can't find that,
two aspirin.
On it, Schmoo.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.919
BARRY: Hurry! Move, move!

17:01.921 --> 17:03.588
Why is everyone
listening to him?

17:03.590 --> 17:04.956
He's not
a medical professional!

17:04.958 --> 17:07.125
BARRY: Ice! Give me my ice!

17:07.327 --> 17:08.226
Whew! That's cold.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.328
It's okay, little buddy.
Stay with me.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.729
Clearly,
I can't go anywhere!

17:11.731 --> 17:13.931
I'm pretty sure
my leg and arm are broken!

17:13.933 --> 17:15.700
Nothing is broken!
Look at me!

17:15.702 --> 17:18.469
You're gonna
pull through just fine!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.238
Open, damn it!

17:20.573 --> 17:22.407
Yes! Doctoring!

17:22.876 --> 17:24.475
He's gonna pull through!

17:24.477 --> 17:27.512
My one baby
saved my other baby.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.213
I really did.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.481
I cured him.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.083
ADULT ADAM:<i> Except he didn't.</i>

17:32.085 --> 17:32.784
Well, I was crazy-wrong.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.420
Good thing you went to the
hospital for a second opinion.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.522
The first and only opinion!

17:37.524 --> 17:39.624
Seriously, what's wrong
with everyone?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.793
Doesn't matter.
My doctoring days are done.

17:41.795 --> 17:45.563
I can't believe
I'm saying this,
but I got to admit.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.667
When everyone
was freaking out,
you really did take charge.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.935
How did you know
what to do?

17:50.937 --> 17:54.472
I guess I kind of
felt it in here...

17:54.574 --> 17:55.640
My heart.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.507
The other side, dude!

17:56.509 --> 17:59.010
I got a lot to learn.
So much, it's scary.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.178
Let me re-adjust
your pillow.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.712
(BILLY JOEL'S
<i> THIS IS THE TIME</i> PLAYS)

18:01.714 --> 18:04.482
Look at that.
He's a natural.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.284
He really is.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.122
Lainey, I'm sorry.
I should've never mixed in.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.192
I just want
what's best for him.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.561
Me, too.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.662
But at the end of the day,

18:17.664 --> 18:19.197
it doesn't matter
what we want.

18:19.199 --> 18:23.034
It's up to Barry
to decide
where his life goes.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.637
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Yep, my mom and Lainey</i>
<i> finally realized</i>

18:26.639 --> 18:29.507
<i> they couldn't control</i>
<i> Barry's future,</i>

18:29.509 --> 18:31.776
<i> while Erica was realizing</i>

18:31.778 --> 18:33.811
<i> that it was time</i>
<i> to take control of hers.</i>

18:33.813 --> 18:35.746
Hey. Can we talk?

18:35.748 --> 18:36.981
I'm fine.

18:36.983 --> 18:37.682
(SNIFFLES)

18:37.684 --> 18:39.083
I was just worried
about the dog.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.518
I didn't mean
half the things I said.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.588
Fine. If you don't want
to talk, then I will.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.823
I never knew
that you felt that way.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.459
And now that I do,
maybe...

18:48.728 --> 18:51.496
I'll just go to college
in Philly.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.730
You don't want to do that.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.199
It's okay. There's plenty
of good schools close-by.

18:55.201 --> 18:59.303
Look, as much as I'll hate it
having you gone,

18:59.305 --> 19:03.641
I'll hate it even worse
if you stay here
because of me.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.509
Really?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.677
Yeah, you got to
get out there.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.713
As hard as it is for me,

19:08.715 --> 19:11.315
it's time for you
to start your life.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.484
<i> ¶ ...although we'll want to</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:17.021

19:17.023 --> 19:18.923

19:18.925 --> 19:19.824
ADULT ADAM:<i> When we're young,</i>

19:19.826 --> 19:23.361
<i> we want our future to go</i>
<i> exactly as planned.</i>

19:23.463 --> 19:25.530
<i> But then reality hits.</i>

19:25.532 --> 19:28.232
<i> And sometimes it hits hard.</i>

19:30.003 --> 19:31.335
Barry?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.638
You have to be a doctor.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.106
But that means that we...

19:35.108 --> 19:36.474
I know what it means.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.443
But look at how great
you were with Adam.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.745
It's what
you're meant to do.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.315
What about us and our plan
to be together forever?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.416
I guess...

19:45.418 --> 19:48.653
Life's something you just
can't always plan out.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.454
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.257
We still have the rest
of school, the whole summer.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.526
I hate we have
this ticking clock on us.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.829
Then I guess it only
leaves us one choice.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.334
To make the next few months
the best ever.

now that my dreams

are back on track,
so are yours.

a matter of time
