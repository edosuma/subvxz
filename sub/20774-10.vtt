[John] I used to think the greatest thing
that ever happened to me

01:26.461 --> 01:28.046
was being born a Rayburn.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
It's what I thought since I was a kid.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.971
Welcome, welcome.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.933
We're so happy to have you honeymooning
with us.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.227
-We have the matching set.
-Don't worry about a thing.

01:42.310 --> 01:46.105
Oh, I see you brought your diving gear
all the way from Stockholm.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.607
I've been waiting three years
for my brother to turn 40.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.361
Happy birthday. Would you like
a mimosa or a glass of champagne?

01:51.444 --> 01:52.821
Two mimosas. Thank you.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.572
[John] That never changed...

01:54.656 --> 01:57.158
Bungalow two and six. I will give you...

01:57.742 --> 01:58.785
...till now.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
We'll take the scenic route.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.089
[John] Now I know it was a lie
we were taught to believe.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.468
Two guys were nosing around
asking questions,

02:15.552 --> 02:17.929
checking out the boats
that we worked on for him.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.223
-So?
-I think it was the Feds.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.767
-You don't know it was Feds.
-I know what Feds look like.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.147
They were asking questions about Gilbert.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.399
What kind of questions?

02:29.482 --> 02:33.444
[John] A lie that bonded us
when we didn't know any different.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.072
What was here before you built the inn?

02:36.656 --> 02:40.076
Oh, nothing. It was just nature.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.746
-May I ask how you found it?
-Oh...

02:43.830 --> 02:45.623
Years ago, my husband was in the Navy.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.917
He was stationed off the coast
of Key West.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.546
We were flying up to Miami Beach
in a friend's seaplane.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.506
And Robert looked out the window

02:53.590 --> 02:56.467
and he said,
"Wait, wait. Circle back. Right there.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.014
Right there,
that's where we're gonna live our lives."

03:01.890 --> 03:05.476
And we've been here
for some 40-something years.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.856
All right. We're never leaving.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.983
[chuckles] I know the feeling.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.445
[John] A lie that became our truth.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.282
And it would eventually break us apart.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.378
[Kevin] Jake, just wait. Don't quit.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.505
Jake, Jake, Jake.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.800
-Please.
-Kevin.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.764
You're smart. Get you a lawyer, man.

03:42.847 --> 03:46.309
[John] There was a time when
we were innocent, my siblings and me.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.564
But that's long past.

03:54.525 --> 03:59.030
I asked you here because
nothing matters to me more than the truth.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.409
And I'm gonna tell it.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.996
I don't need to be read my rights.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.291
I'm here to confess.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.086
Jesus fucking Christ.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.382
I'll do everything that I can
to make things better.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.844
Go fuck yourself in hell, please.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.392
I wanna do everything that I can
to help make things right.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.311
So, you can sleep? Is that why?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.566
-I was wrong.
-I don't really want you to do anything.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.194
Okay, because I get it now.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.947
Your fucking brother,
your mother, your sister,

04:41.030 --> 04:44.450
you all have to live with what you did,
you know? You're pathetic.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.786
-I'm over it. Yes, sir.
-Back to work.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.831
Know what you can fucking do?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.376
Just keep Danny's kid out of it.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.837
-Do that.
-Out of what?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.340
"Out of what?"

05:01.134 --> 05:03.052
I didn't fucking tell him what you did.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.099
He doesn't need to know the truth.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.185
About who killed his dad,
he doesn't fucking need that.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.397
I said back to work.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.524
Yes, sir.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.032
Oh, and may I suggest
that you all take your shoes off

05:24.115 --> 05:26.034
and walk barefoot on the warm sand.

-It's lovely.
-Come on, Worsham.

to watch and learn from you.

-Oh, good.

-Thank you.

but are you sure you wanna sell this?

always be open to you, Sally.

Listen, I told Nicolas
I didn't tell anybody anything.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.770
I didn't say shit to anybody.
I don't even know what is going on.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.147
Roy had a heart attack.
I got him to the hospital.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.525
-I was trying to help.
-What else did you tell Nicolas?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.944
I didn't tell him anything.
I don't know anything.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.114
If he calls again, you do not
tell him about me, you understand?

06:46.197 --> 06:47.281
Yes, yes.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.284
Can you tell me what is going on here?

-Nicolas is a Fed.
-What?

06:53.204 --> 06:56.040
-DEA, FBI, I don't fucking know.
-What are you talking about?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.293
That's probably not his real name.

have been in my boatyard, man.

-They're looking for me now.
-Get me a boat.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.850
I can't get you a boat.
That's what I'm telling you.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.104
-All right. All right. Just calm down.
-Think I give a shit about your family?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.272
-Hmm?
-Just--

07:19.355 --> 07:22.692
-You wanna see your Rocky grow up, huh?
-Calm down. Calm down.

I wanna say and I can't think of the word.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.627
Well, your bloodwork is completely normal.

And your EKG is good.
I don't see anything wrong with you.

Shortness of breath? That's not normal.

John, you've been under a lot
of stress lately, okay?

You had a major event
with that diving accident. Take it easy.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.725
-It's my heart.
-It's not your heart.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.894
-What else could it be?
-What do you think?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.521
-You missed some--
-You don't have cancer.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.566
-There's other tests. There's other scans.
-John, you are perfectly fine.

Just take a deep breath for me.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.211
Hmm.

09:06.837 --> 09:11.008
There is one thing I'd like you to try.
I want you to stop taking your medication.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.262
-My blood pressure pills?
-Yes.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.557
Why would I do that?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.518
On rare occasions,
there could be side effects.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.817
-All right.
-Okay.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.652
Good. Thank you.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.781

10:03.853 --> 10:07.815

He just says I need rest is all.

He wants to see you.

-About what?
-Danny.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.453
He wants to ask you some questions.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.997
Come sit with me.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
I told him you'd be happy to talk,

10:27.418 --> 10:30.671
but to give you a few days
when you're feeling better.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.091

-So, you're just friends?
-Oh, come on, now. Don't--

What're you talking about?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.629
Tell her, John.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.721
He thinks that Dad had an affair.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.641
That woman had a kid.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.813
Mom found out,
which is why she was leaving

12:10.896 --> 12:15.276
on the day that Sarah and I went out
on the boat.

12:15.359 --> 12:20.030
Sarah drowned, and on, and on, and on.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.284
I don't know anything about that.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.457
Yeah, I've told him it's not true,
but he doesn't believe me.

12:31.709 --> 12:36.547
Thirty-five years later,
he's still just a kid.

-You're not fucked.

-Yes.
-Okay.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.185
You listen to me.

15:38.520 --> 15:44.068
You're gonna go,
and you're gonna tell John to fix this.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.821
-He started all of this.
-He can't fix it, Belle.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.532
This is what I'm trying to tell you.
No one can fix this.

15:51.283 --> 15:55.788
You're better off without me.
Rocky, he's better if I'm gone.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.958
This is the only thing
that I can do to help.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.044
You shut up. You listen to me.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.091
You listen to me.
If anyone deserves to go, it's John.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.511
He's not gonna take you away from me.
You understand that?

16:10.594 --> 16:13.639
-I can't.
-You're gonna go to him.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.766
And you're gonna make him fix this.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.561
And he's gonna save you,
and he's gonna save your family.

16:20.145 --> 16:25.025
And I don't care what he has to do
or who he has to fuck over.

16:25.401 --> 16:30.656
The Cubans, or Roy, Diana,
his own fucking children.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.032
Do you understand me?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.744
He's gonna fix this,
and he's gonna save you,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.038
and he's gonna save me and our baby.

16:38.872 --> 16:39.915
Okay?

16:41.542 --> 16:42.376
Yeah.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.812
[knocking]

17:20.122 --> 17:21.832
[keypad beeps, then line ringing]

17:25.878 --> 17:28.297
Chelsea, it's John.
Listen, I'm looking for Nolan.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.924
I need a number on him.
Can you give me a call, please?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.509
Thank you.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.023
[engine starts]

17:47.149 --> 17:49.860
-[Chelsea] Did he leave?
-Yeah, he's gone.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.530
Un-fucking-believable.
He's still coming around.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.660
I gotta get to work.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.506
What do you want me to do, Kevin?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.468
Nothing, John. Fuck.
I knew this was a bad idea.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.887
I told Belle this was a mistake
to talk to you.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.473
I knew you were gonna
give me that judgment.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.895
That thing you do. That "you're such
a fuckup" stare. I knew it.

18:26.980 --> 18:32.152
Why do you do that?
I mean, I'm seriously asking you. Why--?

18:33.862 --> 18:36.907
Why is it so important for you
to be superior to me?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.284
Me? I mean, I'm a fucking--

18:40.911 --> 18:44.164
I'm an asshole. Everybody knows it.
I've fucked up my whole life.

18:45.916 --> 18:50.712
But why do you get so much
satisfaction by feeling superior to me?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.257
-I don't.
-Yes, you do, John.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.509
You've done it my whole life.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.720
I shouldn't take it personally.
You've done it to me, to Meg.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.766
-You did it to Danny.
-I don't feel like I'm better than you.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.278
Nolan came by to see me earlier.
He wanted to talk about Danny.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.991
-Did you talk to him?
-Fuck no.

19:19.449 --> 19:22.870
You know he was talking to Chelsea
at the trial, right? Did you see that?

19:24.246 --> 19:25.789
What do you think he knows, John?

19:30.085 --> 19:31.420
I'm not sure.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.634
-You don't have a number on him, do you?
-Fuck no.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.636
I don't know shit about that kid.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.233
What exactly is it
that you want me to do for you?

19:58.822 --> 20:00.824
[duck quacking]

20:03.452 --> 20:06.872
[Diana] I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to tell you at first.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.628
And then you had your accident and I--

20:17.049 --> 20:18.967
It's horrible timing. You can say so.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.681
-Where's Janey?
-She's at the new place.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.142
Where is the new place?

20:27.893 --> 20:30.729
It's north of Marathon, on the ocean side.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.900
[Diana sighs]

20:34.983 --> 20:37.444
I tried to leave you
half of everything and--

20:38.028 --> 20:41.448
If there's anything you still want,
you just come and take it.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.825
I don't want any of it. Take it all.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.536
I don't need it.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.382
I was thinking about the first time
I came to dinner at the inn.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.841
I was 16.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.387
We'd been going out
for a few months,

21:03.470 --> 21:07.140
but that was the first time
that I met everybody.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.143
And I was really excited.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.231
But you kept checking on me
the whole night because

21:14.314 --> 21:16.358
you'd warned me that
Danny was a loose cannon,

21:16.441 --> 21:19.111
and your dad can run hot and cold.
Do you remember that?

21:22.072 --> 21:24.491
And I remember when
I went home that night,

21:25.701 --> 21:27.911
my mom asked how it went, and I said--

21:29.079 --> 21:34.960
Before I even understood what it meant,
I said that, "Everybody seemed so sad."

21:36.753 --> 21:39.089
What--? What are you talking about?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.467
I remember that dinner.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.096
Everyone was happy at that dinner.

21:46.179 --> 21:50.809
We were all laughing 'cause Kevin was
trying to breakdance or something.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.853
-We were all happy.
-I know. You're right.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.980
You never say-- You never say.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.900
You never said we were sad, ever.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.239
It wasn't like anybody said anything
or anybody did anything.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.574
It was just a feeling.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.124
I couldn't have even told you then
what it meant.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.545
But there was a heaviness in the air.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.924
And I tried.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.345
I really tried to put it
out of my mind for years.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.517
But I was right.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.564
You are, all of you.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.735
But you more than anybody.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.160
You've never really been happy.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.667
I could feel that.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.757
And I guess I just thought that I--

23:05.425 --> 23:07.761
I was so in love with you that...

23:09.012 --> 23:12.516
maybe... maybe I could help change that.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.855
I waited for you.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.903
I tried to show you in a thousand
different ways that I was here waiting.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.697
That when you were done with it,
with all that your family does to you,

23:27.781 --> 23:30.909
that I would still be here for you.

23:34.496 --> 23:38.375
But that sorrow,
that torment in you, it's never changed.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.589
I love you.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.219
God, I love you.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.680
[sighs deeply]

23:54.766 --> 23:56.434
You're the only man that I have--

24:03.942 --> 24:05.152
That I've ever loved.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.159
It's not enough.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.377
I'm sorry.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.756
[sighs] God, I know you are.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.346
I never meant it to be like this.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.602
Of course you didn't.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.302
[sobbing]

25:26.149 --> 25:28.151
[♪♪♪]

25:47.003 --> 25:49.589
-[Ben] He's just like his dad.
-How do you know?

25:49.673 --> 25:51.007
He's not coming.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.593
-[Janey] You don't know anything.
-[Ben] I don't know anything?

25:53.677 --> 25:56.137
-[Janey] No.
-I get it. You're buddies with him now.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.640
-You guys are pals?
-Look, Nolan is your cousin.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.434
He's part of the family.
You can't blame him

26:01.518 --> 26:04.729
for not being as comfortable
around all this as you are.

26:05.814 --> 26:10.944
It's no surprise he's not as...
well adjusted to this as you.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.071
He's better adjusted
than everyone thinks.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.447
Yeah, right.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.575
I wanted to talk
to the three of you together,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.496
but I'll just have to talk
to Nolan another time.

26:26.751 --> 26:30.088
So, I'm selling the inn.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.173
-Why?
-What?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.510
Well, this house, this home.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.014
All these years, whenever I thought
about my family

26:39.097 --> 26:41.224
or the blessings I've been given, I--

26:42.976 --> 26:46.313
I saw this house, not the people.

26:46.938 --> 26:52.694
Not your parents or your aunt and uncles,
not even me or your grandfather.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.696
I saw a building.

26:55.989 --> 27:00.243
Not the family.
I saw a symbol of the Rayburn family.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.080
And that's wrong.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.127
I don't want you all
to try to hold on to it.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.465
Or all the sorrow that it's brought on.
You're free of all that.

27:16.384 --> 27:20.096
So I'm selling the inn,

27:20.180 --> 27:22.891
and I'm giving the money
to my grandchildren.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.812
-But what about you?
-What are you gonna do?

27:27.896 --> 27:28.730
Oh...

27:29.314 --> 27:31.775
I don't know. I'll be fine.
Maybe I'll travel.

27:31.858 --> 27:36.404
I can see some of the places
your grandfather and I wanted to see.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.864
You can't leave.

27:38.531 --> 27:39.741
Honey.

27:41.951 --> 27:46.206
Maybe things feel like
too much is moving too fast.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.086
And maybe it is, but we'll be okay.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.132
-Does Dad know you're doing this?
-Not yet.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.635
No, I didn't want him
to try to talk me out of it.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.012
But I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.556
And I won't change my mind.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.518
This money belongs to you, just you.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.313
This is your inheritance.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.360
[truck pulls up, then truck door opens]

28:24.327 --> 28:26.037
[door opens]

28:27.580 --> 28:29.666
-[waitress] More coffee?
-[woman] Yeah, please.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.211
Detective Rayburn. Agent Kimball.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.046
[John] Thank you for coming.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.801
-Do you want something to eat?
-I'm good.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.850
-My brother Kevin.
-What about him?

28:48.101 --> 28:50.061
I know you've got
an ongoing investigation.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.021
-You can't talk about it.
-That's right.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.526
Kevin feels that he's the target
of the investigation

28:56.609 --> 28:59.738
because of possibly his association
with Roy Gilbert.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
As you said, I can't comment on that.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.367
I'm not asking for any special favors,
believe me.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.497
I do think it's possible that
you and I could help each other out here.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.168
I know you've had a rough year.
I don't wanna make it worse.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.172
But your brother Kevin is
in a whole world of trouble.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.425
Whatever my brother has done,

29:21.092 --> 29:23.845
you have to know that
he's entry level at best.

29:25.722 --> 29:26.848
We know that.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.476
So, we can talk then?

29:33.062 --> 29:34.814
You think he'd turn State's Witness?

29:36.316 --> 29:39.652
I can't be positive,
but I'm pretty damn sure.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.907
Our primary interest is Gilbert.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.577
His networks, his associates,
his international connections.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.581
Kevin and his family,
they are not safe down here.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.334
If he testifies,
he'll need witness protection.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.963
If he's helpful, we'll figure it out,

29:59.047 --> 30:01.800
but things are moving really fast,
Detective.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.345
It always does, doesn't it?

30:07.305 --> 30:10.266
-"Moving fast"? What does that mean?
-We're running out of time.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.228
So, they'd put us
like in witness protection?

30:13.311 --> 30:15.647
-Where? Where would we go?
-It doesn't matter.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.524
-That's not gonna work.
-Why?

30:17.857 --> 30:19.943
Kevin, if you turn on Gilbert,

30:20.026 --> 30:22.862
he's gonna use Marco's murder
as leverage to protect himself.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.657
He won't do that. He's not gonna do that.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.243
He said I'm like a son to him.
He wouldn't do that.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.703
Have you ever wondered
where the murder weapon is?

30:32.497 --> 30:33.540
The night everything happened,

30:33.623 --> 30:36.209
Shakowski tells you to go out
and bring it back to him.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.337
Why would he do that, Kevin?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.966
'Cause Roy has it now. That's why.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.177
I'm telling you because you need
to know where the investigation is.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.763
You need to know how much
investment they have in you.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.516
You need to understand
that there is another option.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.811
Prison, that's the other option?
The only thing left. That's the best.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.564
They'd get me for trafficking.
They don't have anything else on me.

30:58.815 --> 30:59.816
I'll be--

31:03.069 --> 31:04.070
Fuck.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.281
Fuck, I don't know what to do.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.408
I'm telling you what to do.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.244
Turn yourself in.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.497
[cell phone chimes]

31:17.709 --> 31:18.710
Yeah?

31:20.628 --> 31:23.423
I'm gonna need, uh--
I'm gonna need some more time.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.718
Um, a few more hours.
It's not easy to find someone.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.595
[Esteban] Fuck your family--

31:28.678 --> 31:31.598
Shut the fuck up.
Don't you fucking say that!

31:32.891 --> 31:34.142
Listen, just--

31:34.767 --> 31:37.604
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just give me a couple more hours.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.815
-I'll call you back in two hours.
-[Esteban speaks indistinctly]

31:44.861 --> 31:47.614
-That's the Cuban guy.
-You gotta listen to me.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.199
He says he's gonna kill my family
if I don't help him.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.076
-Listen--
-I'm gonna see Roy.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.288
-I gotta talk to Roy one more time.
-You can't fucking do that.

31:55.371 --> 31:59.667
You can't-- Kevin, that's the
wrong decision. You can't do that!

32:11.179 --> 32:13.097
-[knocking on door]
-Roy?
