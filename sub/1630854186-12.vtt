WEBVTT

00:00.336 --> 00:02.250
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.666 --> 00:04.945
Well, I will
watch this and let you know.

00:05.563 --> 00:06.750
She was totally hitting on you.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.435
All she did was rent a movie.

00:08.435 --> 00:10.562
Yeah, and then she laughed
and she touched your arm.

00:10.562 --> 00:12.647
That's textbook flirting.
I wasn't trying to.

00:12.647 --> 00:14.774
All I'm saying is
you're not tied down.

00:14.774 --> 00:16.610
I'm getting parenting advice
from a woman

00:16.610 --> 00:19.613
whose 17-year-old son
got my daughter pregnant.

00:19.613 --> 00:22.407
Grow up, call your daughter,
and make it right.

00:22.407 --> 00:23.575
Now.

00:23.575 --> 00:25.327
Well, I need...
I said now.

00:25.327 --> 00:27.787
I was gonna say

00:27.787 --> 00:29.873
I need the phone number.

00:30.957 --> 00:33.043
Do you have a pen?

00:35.003 --> 00:37.964
Every culture has its own
traditions to celebrate

00:37.964 --> 00:39.466
important life events:

00:39.466 --> 00:40.884
bar mitzvahs,

00:40.884 --> 00:42.260
quinceañeras,

00:42.260 --> 00:43.887
baby's first Comic-Con.

00:43.887 --> 00:47.223
My favorites are funeral
and baby shower.

00:47.223 --> 00:49.100
They're the only two
thrown in your honor

00:49.100 --> 00:50.977
you're not expected to attend.

00:50.977 --> 00:52.145
Love it.

00:52.145 --> 00:54.189
Oh, and after we do gifts,

00:54.189 --> 00:56.650
we could take pictures
holding Mandy's belly.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.234
No.

00:58.234 --> 00:59.486
Okay.

00:59.486 --> 01:00.737
Here's one.

01:00.737 --> 01:02.405
We can fill baby bottles
with juice

01:02.405 --> 01:03.907
and see who can
drink it the fastest.

01:03.907 --> 01:06.743
Don't go drinking
out of my bottle.
Why?

01:06.743 --> 01:08.328
'Cause it ain't
gonna be juice.

01:08.328 --> 01:10.080
When is this thing
anyways?

01:10.080 --> 01:11.206
Sunday.

01:11.206 --> 01:13.333
Oh, shoot.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.585
I got a date with Amber.
I got to cancel.

01:15.585 --> 01:17.128
You ain't invited.

01:17.128 --> 01:18.713
But I'm the dad.

01:18.713 --> 01:21.591
No boys allowed.
Southern Living says so.

01:21.591 --> 01:23.843
Who is Amber?
A girl I'm seeing.

01:23.843 --> 01:25.220
Does Mandy know?

01:25.220 --> 01:27.389
Know what?
Oh, nothing.

01:27.389 --> 01:29.182
It was actually
her idea.

01:29.182 --> 01:31.851
What, Amber?
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:31.851 --> 01:34.020
She's divorced.
What?

01:34.020 --> 01:35.730
Don't worry, she ain't old.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.482
It's just she got married
too young.

01:37.482 --> 01:40.110
Okay. Uh...

01:40.110 --> 01:41.236
So, Mandy,

01:41.236 --> 01:43.905
have you given any thought

01:43.905 --> 01:46.282
to which friends or family
you want to invite?

01:46.282 --> 01:48.284
Well, given the circumstances,

01:48.284 --> 01:50.203
I'm thinking maybe
we keep it small.

01:50.203 --> 01:52.997
'Cause your friends
don't know about this?

01:52.997 --> 01:55.709
They don't know about this.
They don't know about that.

01:55.709 --> 01:57.085
They don't know about any of it.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.088
Can I invite your mom?

02:00.088 --> 02:01.589
Um...

02:01.589 --> 02:03.216
That's a no.

02:03.216 --> 02:05.593
Well...
we would love to have her,

02:05.593 --> 02:07.262
but it's totally up to you.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.723
Fine.

02:09.723 --> 02:11.599
Great.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.767
Is it great?

02:14.477 --> 02:17.564
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:17.564 --> 02:20.066
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:20.066 --> 02:22.485
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:22.485 --> 02:25.572
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:25.572 --> 02:29.576
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:33.705 --> 02:36.124
Oh, I thought of another
game we could play.

02:36.124 --> 02:38.960
First, you melt chocolate
in a diaper...
Keep thinking.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.795
We're coming up
with games to play?

02:40.795 --> 02:43.590
Because I have a good one:
intelligent animal technology.

02:43.590 --> 02:45.008
For example,
if rhinoceroses

02:45.008 --> 02:47.260
were intelligent,
how would they type?

02:47.260 --> 02:48.928
This is for Mandy's baby shower.

02:48.928 --> 02:50.638
Oh. I don't want to go to that.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.016
Thankfully,
it's for ladies only.

02:53.016 --> 02:54.559
Yeah, even if
you're the father.

02:54.559 --> 02:56.352
Why do you want to go?

02:56.352 --> 02:58.521
Well, I'm gonna be at the birth,
but I can't go to the party?

02:58.521 --> 03:00.148
How do you know she
wants you at the birth?

03:00.148 --> 03:01.775
Who's gonna catch the baby?

03:01.775 --> 03:03.026
You may not
want to be there.

03:03.026 --> 03:04.527
It's a rough one.

03:04.527 --> 03:05.570
George.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.280
Oh, you're right, dear.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.866
It's a beautiful event
which I will never forget.

03:09.866 --> 03:12.118
Wait, you said it was beautiful

03:12.118 --> 03:13.912
and then made a face
to imply that it wasn't.

03:13.912 --> 03:15.288
So, which is it?

03:15.288 --> 03:17.791
Oh, my God, Sheldon,
it's disgusting.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.125
He could've just said that.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.752
Pretty good game Sunday,

03:20.752 --> 03:22.921
if you want to watch
with me instead.
All right.

03:22.921 --> 03:25.507
You should invite Mandy's dad
and brother to join you.

03:25.507 --> 03:27.801
It might be awkward.
Don't really know them.

03:27.801 --> 03:28.968
That's how
you get to know them.

03:28.968 --> 03:30.595
Yeah, yeah.

03:30.595 --> 03:32.597
Wait, I don't have to watch
football, do I?

03:32.597 --> 03:33.807
No.
Please don't.

03:33.807 --> 03:35.016
Sweet.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.813
Hi, Jim.

03:39.813 --> 03:41.105
Hey, Mary.
Good to see you.

03:41.105 --> 03:42.816
You looking
for some tires?

03:42.816 --> 03:45.193
Actually, I'm looking
for your wife.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.694
Oh.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.614
You're not gonna yell
at her again, are you?

03:49.614 --> 03:50.824
No, no.

03:50.824 --> 03:52.200
Okay, you sure about that?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.369
'Cause I wouldn't mind
seeing it.

03:54.369 --> 03:56.830
I just wanted
to drop off an invitation

03:56.830 --> 03:58.331
to Mandy's baby shower.

03:58.331 --> 04:00.875
Oh. Well, that's-that's
real kind of you.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.294
And George is hoping
that you'll come over

04:03.294 --> 04:05.004
and watch the game
with him and Georgie.

04:05.004 --> 04:07.173
Huh. Well, that
sounds like fun.

04:07.173 --> 04:08.925
And your son is welcome, too.

04:08.925 --> 04:11.511
All right, well, you know,
Connor ain't all that much

04:11.511 --> 04:14.180
into football or baseball.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.432
Or, shoot,
anything with a ball, really.

04:16.432 --> 04:18.268
Well, if you do come,

04:18.268 --> 04:20.228
I know that George
is making brisket.

04:20.228 --> 04:22.188
Brisket and football?

04:22.188 --> 04:24.274
Well, you drive a hard bargain.

04:26.234 --> 04:27.861
Hello, Mary.

04:27.861 --> 04:29.112
Hi.

04:30.864 --> 04:34.242
All right, well,
I'm gonna go help, uh...

04:34.242 --> 04:35.743
somebody.

04:39.998 --> 04:41.833
I want to apologize

04:41.833 --> 04:44.377
for getting off
on the wrong foot last time.

04:44.377 --> 04:47.589
Oh. You mean when you called me
a terrible mother?

04:47.589 --> 04:51.509
The important thing is
you and Mandy are talking again.

04:51.509 --> 04:52.886
Mm-hmm.

04:52.886 --> 04:55.597
Anyway, I just
wanted to drop off

04:55.597 --> 04:59.851
this invitation
to her, uh, baby shower.

05:01.102 --> 05:02.729
Thank you for including me.

05:02.729 --> 05:03.813
Of course.

05:06.816 --> 05:08.109
You'd think her own mother
would know

05:08.109 --> 05:09.694
she was having a girl.

05:09.694 --> 05:12.655
Well, Georgie wants it
to be a surprise,

05:12.655 --> 05:14.782
so she's barely told anyone.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.783
She told you.

05:16.565 --> 05:17.702
Barely.

05:17.702 --> 05:18.828
Um...

05:18.828 --> 05:20.413
you know what'd be great is

05:20.413 --> 05:23.207
if you could come
and help us plan it.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.920
I'd like that.
Thank you very much.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.713
Then it's settled.

05:28.713 --> 05:30.965
All right, please, uh,
say goodbye to your husband.

05:30.965 --> 05:32.467
Well, you can
tell him yourself.

05:32.467 --> 05:35.178
He's hiding behind
that stack of tires.

05:37.639 --> 05:39.515
Bye.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.578
It's open.

05:45.796 --> 05:47.131
Hello.

05:47.793 --> 05:48.457
I was wondering

05:48.574 --> 05:50.738
if I could have access
to the lab on Sunday.

05:50.871 --> 05:53.290
I'm not here on Sunday.
Where will you be?

05:53.290 --> 05:55.167
If I tell you that,
you might go there.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.878
Well, I told you
where I'll be: the lab.

05:57.878 --> 06:00.251
How about this?
Here's the key. Go nuts.

06:00.392 --> 06:02.602
But I'm a minor.
I require adult supervision.

06:02.602 --> 06:03.770
I won't tell anyone.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.313
I will. I'm quite the tattler.

06:05.313 --> 06:07.023
Then you'll have to wait
till Monday.

06:07.023 --> 06:09.401
But I'm trying to get
out of the house on Sunday.

06:09.401 --> 06:11.903
Why?
The father and
the brother of the woman

06:11.903 --> 06:13.530
my brother impregnated
are coming over to watch sports

06:13.530 --> 06:15.240
with my brother and my father.

06:15.774 --> 06:18.618
So you're trying to avoid
a male bonding experience?

06:18.618 --> 06:19.786
At all cost.

06:19.786 --> 06:21.705
You know, son, as scientists,

06:21.705 --> 06:24.416
we're often teamed with
people that we don't know.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.501
The ability to bond
and build relationships,

06:26.501 --> 06:28.753
that's-that's
an essential skill.

06:28.753 --> 06:31.631
So you're suggesting
I use this gathering

06:31.631 --> 06:34.217
as an opportunity
to better those skills?

06:34.217 --> 06:35.969
Exactly.

06:35.969 --> 06:37.345
Very well. I'll give it a go.

06:37.345 --> 06:39.597
Great.
Would you like to join us?

06:39.597 --> 06:41.808
I can't.
Why? Where will you be?

06:45.228 --> 06:48.398
So, I was thinking we could do
something sweet and simple,

06:48.398 --> 06:50.191
like a garden party.

06:50.191 --> 06:51.776
Oh, that sounds good.

06:51.776 --> 06:53.737
I know Mandy doesn't like
to make a big fuss.

06:53.737 --> 06:55.613
Since when?

06:55.613 --> 06:58.199
That girl has always wanted
to be the center of attention.

06:58.199 --> 07:00.869
Oh, well, I guess
you would know.

07:00.869 --> 07:02.620
And garden party sounds lovely,

07:02.620 --> 07:04.664
but maybe we could do something
a little more fun.

07:04.664 --> 07:06.374
Like princess

07:06.374 --> 07:08.585
or "around the world"--
you know, all the places

07:08.585 --> 07:11.171
she was gonna go,
but now she can't

07:11.171 --> 07:13.089
'cause she ruined her life.

07:14.090 --> 07:15.633
I like princess.

07:15.633 --> 07:17.761
Oh, great.
I know this wonderful bakery

07:17.761 --> 07:21.097
that makes a cake that looks
just like a fairy-tale castle.

07:21.097 --> 07:23.850
I was gonna make
my German chocolate cake.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.187
She's having a girl,
not starting World War II.

07:29.105 --> 07:30.899
Castle cake it is.

07:30.899 --> 07:32.317
Yay.

07:35.987 --> 07:37.322
Hello.

07:37.322 --> 07:39.824
Ugh, nerd movies
are over there.

07:39.824 --> 07:42.494
No, I need to bond
with Mandy's father and brother,

07:42.494 --> 07:44.454
so I'm looking for movies
they might've seen,

07:44.454 --> 07:46.915
so that we can engage in
some testosterone-rich banter.

07:46.915 --> 07:50.585
Okay, I can
help you.

07:50.585 --> 07:52.545
A lot of dudes have
been renting this.

07:52.545 --> 07:53.880
"Bingo.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.132
He's every family's
best friend."

07:56.132 --> 07:57.300
Are you tricking me?

07:57.300 --> 07:58.426
No.

07:58.426 --> 08:00.678
Glad I asked.
Ring me up.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.518
That was fun. Thanks.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.397
That was fun. Thanks.

08:11.397 --> 08:13.441
Are we still on
for Sunday?

08:13.441 --> 08:16.152
Sorry, can't.
Mandy's having a baby shower.

08:16.152 --> 08:18.154
You're going to that?

08:18.154 --> 08:20.756
No, but I promised I'd hang out
with her dad and brother, so...

08:22.075 --> 08:23.910
Is it weird to talk
about this stuff?

08:23.910 --> 08:27.956
Would it be weird if
I talked about my ex-husband?

08:27.956 --> 08:29.499
Depends.
What would you say?

08:29.499 --> 08:31.835
I don't know.

08:31.835 --> 08:34.671
Maybe that he's six-four,
weighs about 240 pounds,

08:34.671 --> 08:35.839
got a short fuse.

08:35.839 --> 08:37.674
Yeah, I don't want to hear that.

08:37.674 --> 08:41.136
Well, I'm fine if you want
to talk about your situation.

08:41.136 --> 08:43.555
Oh, great,
'cause I need some advice.

08:43.555 --> 08:45.306
So, should I get Mandy
a present?

08:45.306 --> 08:47.225
You mean, like a baby gift?

08:47.225 --> 08:50.937
Or for her. You know, like,
"Thanks for making the effort"?

08:50.937 --> 08:54.941
I don't think I would
engrave that on anything,

08:54.941 --> 08:57.402
but... could be sweet.

08:57.402 --> 08:58.736
Cool.

08:59.696 --> 09:02.031
You were just playing about
your ex being that big, right?

09:03.199 --> 09:06.452
But the divorce was a mutual
thing? He wanted it, too?

09:09.414 --> 09:11.958
He ain't in there, is he?

09:14.627 --> 09:16.254
Hey.

09:16.254 --> 09:17.922
I hate that woman.

09:17.922 --> 09:20.049
Your mother? Eh, she ain't
gonna live forever.

09:20.049 --> 09:21.759
Mandy's mom.

09:21.759 --> 09:24.179
Oh. Yeah, that one
we're stuck with for a while.

09:24.179 --> 09:25.889
I extended an olive branch

09:25.889 --> 09:27.724
to make her feel
part of the baby shower,

09:27.724 --> 09:29.601
and then she just took over
the whole dang thing.

09:29.601 --> 09:31.936
All right, I'll run her over
with my truck.

09:31.936 --> 09:34.439
I'm not ready
to laugh yet, George.

09:36.065 --> 09:37.358
When you are ready to laugh,

09:37.358 --> 09:38.693
I have got the
movie for you.

09:38.693 --> 09:40.195
Bingo. It's for men,

09:40.195 --> 09:41.571
but I think you'll get it.

09:50.663 --> 09:52.207
Anybody home?

09:52.207 --> 09:53.541
Hey.

09:53.541 --> 09:55.043
What's with all the pink?

09:55.043 --> 09:57.003
Uh, it's 'cause...

09:57.003 --> 09:59.130
it's my party, and I'm a girl.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.548
Makes sense.

10:00.548 --> 10:03.551
So, uh, what are
you doing here?

10:03.551 --> 10:05.386
You know you're not invited
to the shower, right?

10:05.386 --> 10:07.555
I know. It's just,
everybody's bringing presents

10:07.555 --> 10:10.808
for the baby today, so
I wanted to bring one for you.

10:10.808 --> 10:13.061
Georgie, thank you.

10:13.061 --> 10:14.395
Open it.

10:14.395 --> 10:15.980
Okay.

10:17.023 --> 10:19.776
Sorry for the Christmas paper.
That's all we had.

10:25.281 --> 10:26.616
It's beautiful.

10:26.616 --> 10:27.867
Look inside.

10:30.954 --> 10:32.830
What am I looking at here?

10:32.830 --> 10:35.166
It's the sonogram
of our little girl.

10:37.752 --> 10:39.170
I'm not an idiot.

10:41.923 --> 10:43.925
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever seen.

10:43.925 --> 10:46.928
I-I... I love it.

10:46.928 --> 10:48.513
Good. It was actually
Amber's idea.

10:51.099 --> 10:52.433
Oh.

10:54.394 --> 10:56.980
Well, that's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.315
And thank her.

10:59.315 --> 11:01.109
I will.

11:01.109 --> 11:02.588
All right, well,
I'll let you get back

11:02.588 --> 11:04.948
to your party. Okay.

11:08.116 --> 11:10.118
You look great, by the way.

11:24.172 --> 11:25.195
Hey, Jim.

11:25.281 --> 11:27.074
Good to see you again.
Hey, come on in.

11:27.074 --> 11:29.368
Yeah. Thanks for having us.
This here is Connor.

11:29.368 --> 11:32.079
Hey, Connor.
Good to see you. Hey.

11:32.079 --> 11:34.206
Good to see you again,
Mr. McAllister.

11:34.206 --> 11:35.334
Georgie.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.626
Oh, you got some paint on you.

11:37.626 --> 11:38.919
Been doing some work
around the house?

11:38.919 --> 11:40.504
No.

11:40.504 --> 11:42.298
I'm a painter.

11:42.298 --> 11:44.633
Yeah, yeah,
he's always in his room

11:44.633 --> 11:47.344
painting stuff, until
you ask him to paint the garage.

11:48.345 --> 11:49.847
You're hilarious.

11:49.847 --> 11:51.849
All right, sorry. Uh...

11:51.849 --> 11:53.642
He's an artist. Cool.

11:53.642 --> 11:56.937
Like, the, uh... the guy on TV
that paints the clouds.

11:56.937 --> 12:00.608
Uh, my stuff is
a little more, uh, abstract.

12:00.608 --> 12:01.942
Oh, sure.

12:01.942 --> 12:03.569
That means
it doesn't look like stuff.

12:03.569 --> 12:05.362
I hope
you're a starving artist

12:05.362 --> 12:06.822
'cause I got a brisket

12:06.822 --> 12:08.949
on the smoker out there
with your name on it.

12:08.949 --> 12:11.160
Connor, uh, is also, uh,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.329
a-a vegetarian.

12:13.329 --> 12:15.706
No problem.

12:15.706 --> 12:17.666
We got beans.
That's a vegetable.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.251
Right?
Come on.

12:29.803 --> 12:31.513
This cake is amazing.

12:31.513 --> 12:33.974
To look at, sure.

12:33.974 --> 12:35.643
I prefer cakes for eating.

12:35.643 --> 12:38.062
What's your problem?

12:39.313 --> 12:41.857
So, Audrey, is this
your first grandkid?

12:41.857 --> 12:42.983
Yep.

12:42.983 --> 12:44.360
You must be excited.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.903
Sure.

12:47.529 --> 12:50.282
Can't say I'm thrilled
with the circumstances, but...

12:50.282 --> 12:52.743
Amanda's always
done things her way.

12:52.743 --> 12:54.620
I have a lot
of grandkids.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.456
At some point, you just
stop caring how they got here.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.460
I'm gonna get some punch.
It's nonalcoholic.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.586
Oh.

13:06.507 --> 13:07.508
You coming down?

13:07.508 --> 13:09.259
In a sec.

13:09.259 --> 13:11.762
You're not missing much.
It's real awkward down there.

13:14.890 --> 13:15.933
Something wrong?

13:15.933 --> 13:17.267
No.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.186
Is it your mom?

13:19.186 --> 13:20.854
'Cause something's
definitely wrong with mine.

13:20.854 --> 13:22.439
No, she's fine.

13:22.439 --> 13:26.110
Well, she's a nightmare,
but, uh, that's not it.

13:26.110 --> 13:27.403
Pretty.

13:27.403 --> 13:30.322
Yeah, Georgie
got it for me.

13:30.322 --> 13:32.866
There's a sonogram
of our baby inside.

13:32.866 --> 13:34.702
Good for Georgie.

13:34.702 --> 13:37.579
Yeah.

13:37.579 --> 13:39.623
Good for Georgie.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.668
I got to tell you,

13:42.668 --> 13:45.379
I think the Cowboys are gonna
take it all the way this year.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.090
Not really
into football.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.341
Seriously?

13:51.635 --> 13:54.263
That's cool. You like cars?

13:54.263 --> 13:56.140
Not really.

13:57.224 --> 13:58.517
Music?

13:58.517 --> 13:59.893
Yeah.

13:59.893 --> 14:01.270
Great. Who do you like?

14:01.270 --> 14:03.522
The Smiths.

14:03.522 --> 14:05.065
I don't know them.

14:05.065 --> 14:06.275
Guns N' Roses?

14:06.275 --> 14:09.153
Corporate rock sellouts.

14:09.153 --> 14:11.530
Yeah, well,
sellouts who kick ass, so...

14:11.530 --> 14:13.240
Hello.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.492
Sheldon, this is
Mandy's brother, Connor.

14:16.326 --> 14:18.620
Are you watching the game?
Because I heard the Cowboys are

14:18.620 --> 14:20.247
going to go all
the way this year.

14:20.247 --> 14:22.249
It's okay.
He don't watch football either.

14:22.249 --> 14:25.794
Great. I learned who Troy Aikman
is for nothing.

14:27.045 --> 14:29.757
So, Connor seems like
a good kid.

14:29.757 --> 14:32.134
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a good kid.

14:32.134 --> 14:33.469
From another planet.

14:33.469 --> 14:35.512
Oh, I got one of those.

14:35.512 --> 14:36.847
Georgie's little brother.

14:36.847 --> 14:38.932
Is he a 22-year-old
art school graduate

14:38.932 --> 14:40.976
with no prospects of ever
holding down a real job?

14:40.976 --> 14:43.562
Actually,
he's a science genius

14:43.562 --> 14:46.315
who started college
when he was 11.

14:48.025 --> 14:49.860
Let's just talk
about the brisket. Mm.

14:49.860 --> 14:51.695
All right, Missy, you're first.

14:51.695 --> 14:53.572
How much do you think
the baby's gonna weigh?

14:53.572 --> 14:55.783
Uh, I'm gonna say...

14:55.783 --> 14:57.034
Hmm.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.619
18 pounds.

14:58.619 --> 15:00.412
Ooh, ouch.

15:00.412 --> 15:02.539
Too much?
Too much.

15:02.539 --> 15:04.875
But then again,
Georgie was a big'un.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.835
How big?

15:06.835 --> 15:08.170
Almost ten pounds.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.505
Ten pounds?

15:09.505 --> 15:12.049
She walked like a cowboy
for months.

15:13.300 --> 15:16.136
Both my children
were normal weight.

15:16.136 --> 15:18.430
Well, good job.

15:18.430 --> 15:20.057
My turn.

15:20.057 --> 15:22.726
Mm-kay, the belly button's
still got a little give.

15:24.436 --> 15:26.146
So, I'm gonna say...

15:26.146 --> 15:29.233
a quick and easy
six pounds, two ounces

15:29.233 --> 15:31.485
gonna slide
right out of there.

15:31.485 --> 15:33.612
I love you.

15:35.155 --> 15:38.200
So, Connor, what was
your sister like as a kid?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.787
Um... we really
didn't get along.

15:41.787 --> 15:43.455
Mm.
Yeah, she was older

15:43.455 --> 15:45.165
and loved
picking on me.

15:45.165 --> 15:47.000
The same thing with
me and Georgie.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.170
Once, she replaced my toothpaste
with a tube of hemorrhoid cream.

15:51.588 --> 15:52.965
Remember when I used to
sit on your head

15:52.965 --> 15:54.258
when you'd watch Star Trek?

15:54.258 --> 15:55.801
I do.

15:55.801 --> 15:57.427
Guess what I did
when they'd fire their phasers.

15:57.427 --> 15:58.929
You don't need
to say it.

15:58.929 --> 16:00.848
I farted.

16:02.391 --> 16:03.642
Hilarious.

16:04.852 --> 16:06.270
Okay.

16:06.270 --> 16:08.480
Oh, a nursing bra.

16:09.857 --> 16:13.610
"Includes removable pads
to prevent leakage."

16:13.610 --> 16:15.195
Wow.

16:15.195 --> 16:17.865
Thanks.
That's... really thoughtful.

16:17.865 --> 16:19.533
Mine dripped like a faucet.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.577
Wait, I have a question.
Please ask it later.

16:21.577 --> 16:23.662
All right,
next present.

16:23.662 --> 16:24.705
Okay.

16:24.705 --> 16:25.956
That one's from me.

16:27.457 --> 16:29.793
What leaks? The boob?
Later.

16:34.506 --> 16:35.966
What's this?

16:35.966 --> 16:38.427
We set up a nursery
in the guest room.

16:38.427 --> 16:40.053
You can move
back in.

16:40.053 --> 16:42.472
Can we not talk
about this now?

16:42.472 --> 16:45.559
What's the problem?
You're gonna need help.

16:45.559 --> 16:48.228
Who do you think's been
helping her this whole time?

16:48.228 --> 16:51.273
And I appreciate it,
but you're not her family.

16:51.273 --> 16:52.691
We're that baby's family.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.610
Georgie's right across
the street.

16:54.610 --> 16:58.238
Oh, yes, I'm sure a teenage boy
is gonna be a lot of help.

16:59.573 --> 17:01.033
You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:01.033 --> 17:04.453
Georgie has been there
for me the whole time,

17:04.453 --> 17:06.121
and you come in
at the last minute

17:06.121 --> 17:08.248
with a store-bought
castle cake,

17:08.248 --> 17:10.417
and-and you think that's
gonna make up for everything?

17:10.417 --> 17:13.795
Okay, I can see you're
a little emotional.

17:13.795 --> 17:15.589
Yeah, I am a little
emotional right now,

17:15.589 --> 17:17.215
and you being here
isn't helping.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.719
You do not get
to bad-mouth Georgie.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.515
He's gonna be a better parent
than you ever were.

17:26.398 --> 17:27.434
Damn.

17:27.434 --> 17:30.020
Now, if someone would help me
up, I would like to storm out.

17:31.873 --> 17:33.541
Thank you.

17:35.901 --> 17:37.444
So, who wants cake?

17:37.444 --> 17:40.113
Bingo, it's a subpoena.

17:40.113 --> 17:42.658
How's a dog supposed
to read a subpoena?

17:42.658 --> 17:44.993
Look how gritty
this is.

17:44.993 --> 17:47.037
Frank Miller really brought
a whole new aesthetic

17:47.037 --> 17:48.705
to comic books.

17:48.705 --> 17:51.124
Hmm. I've never really
thought of it that way.

17:51.124 --> 17:53.210
I was doing it. I was bonding.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.711
Now, would you please
put it back in the bag?

17:54.711 --> 17:56.213
Oh. Sure.

17:56.213 --> 17:57.756
And I was great at it.

17:59.758 --> 18:02.970
14 hours
of smoke and love.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.471
Trying not to drool.

18:04.471 --> 18:07.474
Jim, Connor,
we're leaving!

18:07.903 --> 18:10.322
All right, hon,
but the brisket...
Now!

18:10.727 --> 18:12.062
I'll make you
a doggy bag.

18:12.062 --> 18:13.855
Jim.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.093
Poor bastard.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.647
Hey.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.005
I didn't know
you were here.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.588
Just checking out the loot.

18:29.588 --> 18:32.216
This is amazing.
Why don't all bras do this?

18:32.216 --> 18:33.759
Take that off.

18:33.759 --> 18:35.886
Well, that's what's great:
you don't have to.

18:35.886 --> 18:37.846
Look at this.

18:37.846 --> 18:40.265
The father of my child.

18:41.558 --> 18:43.268
Ooh, nipple cream.

18:43.268 --> 18:45.212
Maybe I should've went
to this party.

18:46.271 --> 18:47.666
Sounds fun.
