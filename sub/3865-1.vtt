00:48.740 --> 00:51.827
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

00:53.370 --> 00:56.915
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.

00:57.082 --> 00:59.877
And I'd like to say
a few words, if you please.

01:00.043 --> 01:02.588
Regarding the story
that you're about to see

01:02.754 --> 01:05.716
it actually happened.
Just take it from me.

01:05.883 --> 01:08.927
But there's more to this story
than what's on the page,

01:09.094 --> 01:12.222
so please pay attention
while I set the stage.

01:13.557 --> 01:18.687
<i>We open in Thneedville, a city they
say that was plastic and fake,</i>

01:18.770 --> 01:20.731
<i>and they liked it that way!</i>

01:20.898 --> 01:24.818
<i>A town without nature,
not one living tree.</i>

01:24.943 --> 01:26.570
<i>So, what happened to them?</i>

01:26.778 --> 01:30.032
<i>Cue the music! Let's see.</i>

01:39.917 --> 01:41.418
<i>Buzz. Buzz.</i>

02:03.690 --> 02:09.488
<i>In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn</i>

02:11.114 --> 02:14.868
<i>With brand new cars
and houses and lawns</i>

02:15.035 --> 02:17.954
<i>Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville</i>

02:18.288 --> 02:23.710
<i>In Thneedville,
we manufacture our trees</i>

02:25.629 --> 02:30.384
<i>Each one is made in factories</i>

02:30.550 --> 02:33.303
<i>And uses 96 batteries</i>

02:33.887 --> 02:39.476
<i>In Thneedville,
the air's not so clean</i>

02:41.061 --> 02:42.729
<i>So we buy it fresh</i>

02:42.896 --> 02:45.023
<i>It comes out this machine!</i>

02:45.148 --> 02:47.901
<i>In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville</i>

02:48.402 --> 02:53.407
<i>In Thneedville,
we don't want to know</i>

02:55.700 --> 02:59.496
<i>Where the smog and trash
and chemicals go</i>

02:59.663 --> 03:03.834
<i>I just went swimming,
and now I glow</i>

03:03.917 --> 03:07.504
<i>In Thneedville,
we have fun year round</i>

03:07.671 --> 03:11.007
<i>We surf and snowboard
right in town</i>

03:11.174 --> 03:14.845
<i>We thank the Lord
for all we've got</i>

03:15.011 --> 03:18.682
<i>Including this
brand new parking lot!</i>

03:18.849 --> 03:24.938
<i>Parking lot!</i>

03:28.441 --> 03:31.862
<i>Oh, look, it's Aloysius O'Hare</i>

03:32.028 --> 03:35.407
<i>Aloysius O'Hare</i>

03:35.657 --> 03:39.870
<i>The man who found
a way to sell air</i>

03:40.245 --> 03:42.372
<i>And became a zillionaire</i>

03:44.416 --> 03:46.543
Hip-hip-hooray!

03:46.626 --> 03:49.880
<i>In Thneedville,
we love living this way</i>

03:50.380 --> 03:53.800
<i>It's like living in paradise</i>

03:53.884 --> 03:56.803
<i>It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay</i>

03:56.887 --> 03:57.971
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

03:58.054 --> 04:00.640
<i>Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville</i>

04:00.724 --> 04:02.475
<i>Destined-to-succeed-ville</i>

04:02.559 --> 04:04.644
<i>We-are-all-agreed-ville</i>

04:04.728 --> 04:07.814
<i>We love it here in...</i>

04:09.774 --> 04:11.443
<i>Thneedville!</i>

04:51.107 --> 04:52.400
Yes!

05:07.290 --> 05:08.375
Oh, hi, Ted.

05:09.626 --> 05:11.836
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.

05:12.128 --> 05:14.798
Did your ball land
in my backyard again?

05:14.923 --> 05:16.383
What? No.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.426
A model airplane, this time.

05:19.469 --> 05:21.846
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?

05:22.013 --> 05:23.181
Come on.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.147
Whoa!

05:37.904 --> 05:39.447
Did you...

05:39.739 --> 05:41.616
Did you paint this?

05:41.741 --> 05:43.618
Do you like it?
What?

05:43.952 --> 05:47.539
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!

05:47.789 --> 05:48.873
What are those?

05:48.957 --> 05:52.085
Those are trees.
Real ones.

05:52.377 --> 05:55.463
They used to grow
all around here.

05:56.381 --> 05:59.259
And people said that
the touch of their tufts

05:59.342 --> 06:01.886
was softer than
anything, even silk.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.722
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!

06:04.806 --> 06:07.016
Wow! What does
that even mean?

06:07.308 --> 06:08.518
I know, right?

06:10.895 --> 06:11.980
Oh, yeah.

06:12.063 --> 06:15.567
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see

06:16.025 --> 06:18.111
a real living tree

06:18.820 --> 06:19.988
growing in my backyard.

06:20.363 --> 06:23.116
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.

06:23.199 --> 06:25.952
If a guy somehow got you one...

06:26.161 --> 06:28.329
I'd probably
marry him on the spot.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.166
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?

06:31.416 --> 06:33.251
No! Not crazy.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.670
Not crazy at all.

06:42.844 --> 06:45.555
Ted, honey,
don't play with your food.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.015
You, either, Mom.

06:51.060 --> 06:56.649
So, Mom, do you happen to
know if there's any place

06:56.816 --> 06:59.235
where I could get a real tree?

06:59.402 --> 07:02.155
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.

07:02.405 --> 07:04.616
Yeah, but I mean a real one

07:04.699 --> 07:07.785
that grows out of
the ground or whatever.

07:07.869 --> 07:09.370
You know, a real tree.

07:09.537 --> 07:10.580
Really?

07:10.663 --> 07:13.499
You would rather
have some dirty, messy

07:13.750 --> 07:16.085
lump of wood that just
sticks out of the ground?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.545
And it does what? I don't
even know what it does.

07:17.629 --> 07:18.755
What's its purpose?

07:18.838 --> 07:20.131
Look at what we've got.

07:20.215 --> 07:23.509
It's the Oak-amatic. The only
tree with its own remote.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.638
Summer, autumn, winter,

07:26.721 --> 07:27.931
and disco!

07:32.769 --> 07:34.395
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.

07:34.479 --> 07:35.563
Dance with the tree.

07:35.647 --> 07:37.690
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.

07:38.232 --> 07:40.234
So' anyway...

07:40.360 --> 07:42.195
Let's just say I need a tree.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.863
Where would I go?
What do I do?

07:44.072 --> 07:47.075
Then you know what? You
need to find the Once-ler.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.160
The what?

07:49.243 --> 07:54.499
Mom, it's not really the time for
one of your magical fables, okay?

07:54.791 --> 07:56.876
That's right, I forgot.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.546
I'm old and can't even
remember to put my teeth in.

08:00.797 --> 08:02.590
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.

08:02.674 --> 08:04.634
No, really, I forgot my teeth.

08:04.926 --> 08:07.512
Would you be a dear
and go get them for me?

08:07.595 --> 08:09.514
Sure, Mom.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.313
Okay, here's the deal.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.525
The Once-ler is the man who knows
what happened to the trees.

08:20.608 --> 08:22.944
You want one,
you need to find him.

08:23.027 --> 08:25.697
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.

08:25.780 --> 08:28.199
Okay. Grammy,
is this a real thing

08:28.282 --> 08:29.659
that we're talking about now?

08:29.784 --> 08:31.452
Oh, he's real all right.

08:31.786 --> 08:33.538
Well, where can I find him?

08:36.249 --> 08:40.294
Far outside of town
where the grass never grows

08:40.586 --> 08:44.131
and the wind smells slow
and sour when it blows.

08:46.467 --> 08:50.680
And no birds ever sing,
excepting old crows.

08:53.808 --> 08:54.976
Quit doing that.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.520
That's the place
where the Once-ler lives.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.939
Wait, outside of town?

09:00.857 --> 09:04.485
People used to say
if you brought him 15 cents,

09:04.652 --> 09:05.695
<i>a nail</i>

09:05.945 --> 09:09.866
<i>and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,</i>

09:11.826 --> 09:14.662
<i>he would tell you everything.</i>

09:44.692 --> 09:45.735
Hmm.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.685
Mr. O'Hare,
what we've got for you

10:19.769 --> 10:22.063
is something that is
going to take O'Hare Air

10:22.230 --> 10:23.898
to the next level.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.983
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.

10:26.067 --> 10:28.194
One, "I've gotten rich
selling people air that's"

10:28.277 --> 10:30.363
"fresher than
the stinky stuff outside"

10:30.446 --> 10:32.073
Two, and here is
the important one,

10:32.156 --> 10:34.575
"How can I possibly make
even more money?"

10:34.784 --> 10:36.577
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.

10:36.744 --> 10:39.413
Check out this commercial, huh?

10:41.958 --> 10:44.377
Well, here goes
another lame Saturday.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.922
Dude, I don't think so!

10:49.423 --> 10:50.508
Huh!

10:51.592 --> 10:52.718
Hey!

10:55.304 --> 10:56.347
Man!

10:56.430 --> 10:57.515
Oh, yeah!

10:58.474 --> 10:59.600
What!

11:03.270 --> 11:04.480
Yeah!

11:05.147 --> 11:07.942
<i>O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.</i>

11:08.025 --> 11:09.360
<i>Please breathe responsibly.</i>

11:09.443 --> 11:10.569
Ah?

11:10.653 --> 11:12.405
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.

11:12.947 --> 11:14.907
You got to be kidding me.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.952
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?

11:18.244 --> 11:21.706
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle,

11:21.789 --> 11:22.957
people will buy it.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.166
Exactly. And...

11:24.250 --> 11:26.252
And what's more, when
we build a new factory

11:26.335 --> 11:27.920
to make the plastic bottles,

11:28.045 --> 11:30.506
the air quality is
just going to get worse.

11:30.715 --> 11:32.717
Which will make people
want our air even more,

11:32.800 --> 11:34.760
and drive sales where?

11:34.885 --> 11:35.928
Through the roof!

11:36.220 --> 11:40.641
So, in other words,
the more smog in the sky

11:42.518 --> 11:43.978
the more people will buy.

11:46.188 --> 11:49.608
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!

11:50.443 --> 11:52.445
I'm aware it rhymes.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.488
Coats. Big.

11:54.572 --> 11:56.073
What do you two
knuckleheads want?

11:56.157 --> 11:57.616
I'm in the middle of a meeting!

12:00.619 --> 12:01.704
What?

12:01.996 --> 12:03.456
Why is he leaving town?

12:03.581 --> 12:05.499
No one ever leaves town!

12:05.791 --> 12:07.626
See what he's up to.

12:18.929 --> 12:20.264
Whoa!

13:12.191 --> 13:13.317
Huh?

13:15.152 --> 13:16.487
Whoa! Whoa.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.116
Oh, man.

14:21.343 --> 14:22.636
Whoa!

14:22.928 --> 14:24.430
All right.

15:03.093 --> 15:04.178
Okay.

15:05.012 --> 15:07.181
What the...

15:07.264 --> 15:08.766
Whoa!

15:16.482 --> 15:17.566
Who are you?

15:17.816 --> 15:20.068
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

15:20.235 --> 15:22.654
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.

15:22.905 --> 15:25.491
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?

15:25.657 --> 15:27.868
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.287
No one is
supposed to come here.

15:30.579 --> 15:32.581
Get out of here
and leave me alone!

15:32.664 --> 15:34.666
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.834
The boot?

15:36.627 --> 15:37.669
Hello!

15:37.753 --> 15:38.837
Ow!

15:39.004 --> 15:42.049
Listen! People say that if
someone brings you this stuff

15:42.341 --> 15:44.218
that you will tell
them about trees.

15:44.593 --> 15:45.677
No, no, no!

15:48.263 --> 15:49.473
Trees?

15:49.681 --> 15:51.016
Yeah, real ones.

15:51.141 --> 15:53.852
You know,
that grow out of the ground?

15:55.354 --> 15:56.480
Hello?

15:56.563 --> 15:58.023
Sorry, it's just...

15:58.190 --> 16:00.651
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

16:00.734 --> 16:04.238
Well, that's me. The guy
who still cares. I'm here.

16:04.404 --> 16:06.615
Hey! What?

16:07.783 --> 16:09.159
Do you want to
know about trees?

16:09.243 --> 16:11.578
About what happened to them?

16:11.745 --> 16:15.666
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.

16:15.749 --> 16:16.792
Wait, what?

16:22.631 --> 16:24.841
It's because of me!

16:26.927 --> 16:30.556
And my invention, the Thneed.

16:30.931 --> 16:35.102
It was an amazing product that
could do the job of a thousand.

16:36.478 --> 16:37.521
All right.

16:37.980 --> 16:39.731
Sounds ridiculous,
but I mean, that's cool.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.942
You're darn right it was cool!

16:43.110 --> 16:45.988
It all started a long time ago.

16:46.613 --> 16:48.240
Can we start not
so long ago, maybe?

16:48.448 --> 16:49.533
Do you want a tree?

16:49.783 --> 16:51.076
Yes, yes.

16:51.493 --> 16:56.790
Then it all started
a long, long time ago.

16:57.749 --> 17:00.460
<i>I was a young man leaving home.</i>

17:00.544 --> 17:04.172
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.759
I'm actually doing it!

17:07.843 --> 17:10.512
Yes, but just remember, Oncie,

17:10.679 --> 17:13.432
if somehow your invention
ends up a failure

17:13.515 --> 17:15.684
instead of a success,

17:15.851 --> 17:18.228
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all!

17:20.146 --> 17:21.315
Nice wheels.

17:21.815 --> 17:22.898
Burn!

17:23.233 --> 17:25.068
Ow!

17:25.152 --> 17:26.319
Yeah, "Burn!"

17:26.486 --> 17:29.698
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.

17:29.823 --> 17:31.241
Come on, Melvin!

17:31.658 --> 17:34.202
<i>So, there I was
at the very bottom.</i>

17:34.286 --> 17:36.580
<i>With nothing
but a wagon, a mule,</i>

17:36.872 --> 17:40.959
<i>and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.</i>

17:45.672 --> 17:47.049
<i>I was searching the globe,</i>

17:47.299 --> 17:50.635
<i>obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.</i>

17:53.013 --> 17:56.099
<i>But I'd had
absolutely no success.</i>

17:56.349 --> 18:01.146
<i>Until one day, I found paradise.</i>

18:01.313 --> 18:02.355
Oh!

18:02.439 --> 18:04.816
We're going to be
there soon, I'm sure.

18:05.025 --> 18:06.109
Whoa!

18:15.202 --> 18:19.915
This is the most
beautiful place,

18:20.082 --> 18:22.000
okay, I have ever seen.

18:23.710 --> 18:24.920
Oh.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.546
Ta-da!

18:28.215 --> 18:29.299
Whoa!

19:00.747 --> 19:02.666
<i>Yeah</i>

19:02.833 --> 19:04.709
<i>This is it</i>

19:07.087 --> 19:10.090
<i>This is the place</i>

19:10.590 --> 19:15.095
<i>These Truff ula trees
are just what I need</i>

19:15.262 --> 19:20.267
<i>Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed</i>

19:21.476 --> 19:23.144
<i>But first...</i>

19:27.607 --> 19:28.692
Now you!

19:31.361 --> 19:32.612
That's great!

19:43.999 --> 19:46.585
<i>So now our friendship can begin</i>

19:46.668 --> 19:48.962
<i>Hand in hand, and wing and fin</i>

19:49.045 --> 19:51.715
<i>There's nothing
you and I can't do</i>

19:51.798 --> 19:54.759
<i>So let's all make
my dreams come true</i>

20:16.323 --> 20:17.657
Hey, guys!

20:18.158 --> 20:20.910
Come on, where is
my back-up chorus?

20:23.330 --> 20:24.456
What?

20:25.999 --> 20:27.876
Ah-ha! Oh.

20:34.841 --> 20:36.217
Ooh!

21:04.788 --> 21:07.957
<i>Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.</i>

21:08.208 --> 21:09.250
Excuse me?

21:09.876 --> 21:11.920
Yeah, that's awesome.

21:12.087 --> 21:15.090
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.

21:15.423 --> 21:17.383
But, uh, is there
a musical number

21:17.467 --> 21:18.927
where you show me
how to get a tree?

21:19.135 --> 21:20.345
Because I would
love to hear that one.

21:20.595 --> 21:23.389
Oh, yes. Right after the
musical number about the kid

21:23.556 --> 21:25.308
who kept
interrupting the story,

21:25.391 --> 21:27.227
and was never heard from again.

21:27.811 --> 21:29.938
Right, got it. Proceed.

21:31.481 --> 21:33.316
All right, here we go.

21:33.483 --> 21:36.820
About to make a Thneed,
about to change the world.

22:09.269 --> 22:10.562
Check it out, guys...

22:12.021 --> 22:13.106
Where did everybody go?

22:19.737 --> 22:23.074
Little did I know that by
chopping down that tree

22:23.157 --> 22:28.079
I had just summoned a mystical
creature as old as time itself.

22:28.830 --> 22:32.542
The legendary,
slightly annoying

22:32.709 --> 22:34.836
guardian of the forest.

22:35.628 --> 22:37.213
The Lorax.

24:34.789 --> 24:35.832
Hey!
Whoo!

24:37.333 --> 24:38.668
Did you chop down this tree?

24:39.127 --> 24:41.129
Uh... No.

24:42.296 --> 24:43.506
Who did it?

24:43.798 --> 24:45.466
What's that?

24:47.135 --> 24:48.469
I think he did it.

24:50.805 --> 24:52.390
Leave!
Vacate the premises!

24:52.473 --> 24:54.600
Take your ax and get out!

24:54.767 --> 24:57.019
And who are you?

24:57.770 --> 25:01.315
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.

25:01.482 --> 25:03.442
I speak for the trees.

25:05.153 --> 25:07.530
So you're telling me,
you just didn't see me

25:07.613 --> 25:09.490
magically appear
out of that stump?

25:09.657 --> 25:11.576
With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

25:11.659 --> 25:12.785
You didn't see any of that?

25:12.869 --> 25:15.746
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

25:15.913 --> 25:19.876
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

25:20.293 --> 25:21.335
Okay. Um...

25:21.878 --> 25:23.004
Didn't really happen.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.756
Oh, I know what you want!

25:25.840 --> 25:32.221
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy lever saw!

25:32.388 --> 25:35.016
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy...

25:35.308 --> 25:38.185
How dare you!
Give me that!

25:38.519 --> 25:40.146
Mmm.

25:40.938 --> 25:42.356
I'm going to eat this,

25:42.440 --> 25:44.650
but I am highly offended by it.

25:50.072 --> 25:53.868
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?

25:55.369 --> 25:57.079
What's your deal, man?

25:57.204 --> 25:59.498
Pull them right out Time
for you to go, Beanpole!

25:59.707 --> 26:01.834
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.

26:08.049 --> 26:09.425
Stop right there! Stop it!

26:10.926 --> 26:15.931
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

26:17.516 --> 26:18.684
What? No!

26:18.934 --> 26:21.687
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

26:21.979 --> 26:23.189
I would gladly pound you

26:23.272 --> 26:25.066
and your mustache
into the ground!

26:25.232 --> 26:30.029
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

26:30.112 --> 26:33.199
Shame on you.
For shame!

26:34.408 --> 26:36.369
All right, you know what?
That's it!

26:36.452 --> 26:38.371
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

26:38.454 --> 26:40.998
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

26:41.082 --> 26:43.417
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!

26:44.794 --> 26:46.545
End of story.

26:47.380 --> 26:48.839
Then you leave me no choice.

26:51.967 --> 26:56.138
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

26:56.222 --> 27:00.476
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

27:00.768 --> 27:05.106
and curse you until
the end of your days!

27:05.272 --> 27:09.110
You have been warned.

27:15.908 --> 27:17.451
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.

27:17.535 --> 27:19.912
You have been warned.

27:20.871 --> 27:23.207
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

27:23.374 --> 27:25.626
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

27:25.709 --> 27:26.752
What?

27:26.836 --> 27:29.004
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

27:29.588 --> 27:31.590
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

27:31.674 --> 27:32.967
Whoa!

27:33.050 --> 27:34.760
Whoa-ho-ho.

27:34.844 --> 27:35.970
Are you serious right now?

27:36.053 --> 27:38.681
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!

27:38.973 --> 27:41.350
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!

27:41.600 --> 27:44.061
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

27:49.900 --> 27:50.985
No, no.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.029
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

27:54.113 --> 27:57.116
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

27:57.366 --> 27:59.827
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.

28:03.539 --> 28:05.666
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

28:05.749 --> 28:06.917
It's no problem.

28:07.084 --> 28:10.921
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

28:11.213 --> 28:12.548
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:13.299 --> 28:14.383
Mmm.

28:15.176 --> 28:18.387
Maybe. Just maybe.

28:27.855 --> 28:29.315
What did you wish for, Audrey?

28:29.565 --> 28:30.774
Well, I would love to tell you,

28:30.858 --> 28:34.820
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.

28:36.447 --> 28:38.282
I know what she wished for.

28:50.461 --> 28:52.171
Was it, perhaps...

28:53.756 --> 28:55.174
This?

29:03.849 --> 29:05.851
Ted, you didn't.

29:05.935 --> 29:09.146
Oh, no. I totally did.

29:09.313 --> 29:12.191
Happy birthday, Audrey.

29:13.275 --> 29:15.110
Kiss him! Kiss him!

29:28.290 --> 29:29.416
Ted.

29:29.541 --> 29:30.876
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!

29:30.960 --> 29:34.213
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

29:34.380 --> 29:37.216
I just...
I like this cereal.

29:37.299 --> 29:38.509
What one is this?
Yeah!

29:38.676 --> 29:40.260
Okay.

29:40.427 --> 29:43.055
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

29:43.305 --> 29:45.974
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.

29:46.058 --> 29:47.726
So, I'll see you guys.

29:47.976 --> 29:49.895
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

29:49.978 --> 29:51.772
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

29:51.939 --> 29:54.233
It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

29:54.400 --> 29:57.319
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

29:57.403 --> 29:58.529
But...

30:00.572 --> 30:01.657
Hmm.

30:01.740 --> 30:03.117
Mmm?

30:03.617 --> 30:04.952
Oh, man.

30:05.202 --> 30:06.912
Mom, seriously every turn?

30:06.995 --> 30:08.664
Hey, back off!

30:10.165 --> 30:11.417
Ooh!

30:11.500 --> 30:14.712
No.
Okay! Family time is over.

30:14.837 --> 30:18.048
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

30:19.466 --> 30:21.885
Okay, dear. Have fun.

30:24.638 --> 30:26.849
I knew I could break her.

30:27.057 --> 30:28.142
Go.
Huh?

30:28.225 --> 30:29.393
Go see him!

30:29.476 --> 30:30.811
Oh, yeah!

30:32.729 --> 30:35.274
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.

30:40.112 --> 30:41.196
Whoa!

30:55.794 --> 30:57.713
Hey! Ted, right?

30:58.922 --> 31:01.300
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

31:01.467 --> 31:04.678
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.

31:04.845 --> 31:06.513
What's that all about?

31:07.097 --> 31:08.182
Oh. Um...

31:09.183 --> 31:10.559
Where did you hear that?

31:10.642 --> 31:11.727
Oh.

31:11.810 --> 31:13.562
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

31:13.645 --> 31:15.439
that I don't know about.

31:15.522 --> 31:19.359
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

31:19.526 --> 31:22.070
Trees?
They make it for free.

31:22.237 --> 31:24.990
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

31:25.073 --> 31:28.577
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

31:29.411 --> 31:31.455
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

31:31.580 --> 31:33.582
You listen to me, boy.

31:33.790 --> 31:37.252
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

31:37.419 --> 31:39.504
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

31:39.671 --> 31:42.507
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

31:43.467 --> 31:44.760
Yeah, um...

31:45.886 --> 31:47.888
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

31:48.722 --> 31:52.809
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

31:53.435 --> 31:55.687
Grandma just finished her turn.

31:56.605 --> 31:57.731
How did you know?

31:58.649 --> 32:00.567
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

32:05.739 --> 32:06.782
Huh!

32:06.865 --> 32:09.326
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

32:09.409 --> 32:12.913
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

32:13.163 --> 32:15.165
Why, I can't
think of any reason

32:15.332 --> 32:20.045
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

32:20.128 --> 32:21.213
Ever.

32:26.885 --> 32:31.098
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

32:56.456 --> 32:57.499
Oh, no.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.543
Look out!

33:02.838 --> 33:06.383
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.219
Oh, you missed me.
What?

33:09.553 --> 33:13.682
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

33:13.974 --> 33:17.728
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

33:17.811 --> 33:19.521
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

33:19.604 --> 33:21.064
Why aren't you like other kids,

33:21.148 --> 33:23.483
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

33:23.567 --> 33:25.736
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

33:25.819 --> 33:29.573
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

33:30.073 --> 33:34.327
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

33:34.536 --> 33:35.704
Huh?

33:35.787 --> 33:37.330
It's a girl, isn't it?

33:37.664 --> 33:39.332
What? No!

33:39.666 --> 33:42.335
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

33:42.419 --> 33:44.045
well, that's because
he's a guy.

33:44.129 --> 33:46.673
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

33:46.756 --> 33:49.509
it's usually to
impress some girl.

33:49.801 --> 33:51.511
Hey, she is not some girl!

33:51.595 --> 33:54.639
She's a woman, in high school.

33:54.806 --> 33:57.893
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.

33:58.101 --> 33:59.311
Aw!

33:59.394 --> 34:03.398
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

34:03.523 --> 34:04.608
Thank you.

34:04.691 --> 34:06.610
All right,
but where did we leave off?

34:28.089 --> 34:30.467
Now that's a Thneed.

34:30.634 --> 34:33.386
Nothing unmanly
about knitting. No, sir.

34:55.659 --> 34:56.743
Look at that...

34:58.078 --> 34:59.120
Oh!

34:59.204 --> 35:01.206
Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?

35:06.503 --> 35:07.754
Shh!

35:27.524 --> 35:29.609
Okay, nice and easy.

35:36.616 --> 35:39.786
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.

35:42.288 --> 35:45.625
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

35:46.418 --> 35:47.585
Of course he can't swim!

35:47.877 --> 35:50.547
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!

35:55.677 --> 35:57.721
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!

36:02.392 --> 36:04.019
Whoo! Whoo!

36:09.065 --> 36:10.525
Jump, jump!

36:11.109 --> 36:12.944
Come on, get up there.
Come on.

36:13.361 --> 36:15.989
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!

36:18.867 --> 36:20.201
Now what?

36:21.911 --> 36:23.121
Mmm-mmm.

36:24.247 --> 36:25.749
Get up there.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.003
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.

36:30.086 --> 36:31.129
Come on,
reach out for the Lorax.

36:34.966 --> 36:36.217
Where did you go?

36:39.512 --> 36:40.764
Bar-ba-loots.

36:49.439 --> 36:50.565
Oh, that's bad.

36:55.111 --> 36:56.613
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!

37:06.080 --> 37:08.041
What's happening?
Where am I?

37:08.124 --> 37:11.544
Hey! We got trouble,
and it's coming up fast!

37:14.214 --> 37:15.256
Whoo!

37:15.340 --> 37:16.841
We're in a river!

37:35.276 --> 37:36.319
Whew!

37:40.573 --> 37:41.741
Oh, no.

37:44.953 --> 37:46.412
Just do something!

37:47.539 --> 37:49.123
Help is on the way!

37:52.168 --> 37:53.795
No, no!

37:55.421 --> 37:56.673
Just a minute!

38:18.152 --> 38:19.237
Oh, no!

38:22.991 --> 38:24.284
Wake up! Wake up!

38:25.326 --> 38:27.453
Yuck!

38:32.583 --> 38:33.710
Clear!

38:33.793 --> 38:35.003
Ah!

38:38.047 --> 38:39.590
I was heading into the light,

38:39.674 --> 38:41.592
and you pulled me
right back and here I am!

38:41.884 --> 38:43.219
You saved my life!

38:43.303 --> 38:46.222
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.

38:46.306 --> 38:47.473
It is a big deal!

38:47.682 --> 38:51.728
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...

38:52.437 --> 38:55.189
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?

38:55.314 --> 38:57.984
Uh... About that...

38:58.735 --> 39:02.655
Actually... I put your
bed in the water.

39:03.364 --> 39:04.866
I didn't mean you any harm.

39:04.949 --> 39:07.452
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.

39:08.453 --> 39:10.913
Look, everyone here
needs the trees

39:10.997 --> 39:13.124
and you're chopping them down!

39:13.833 --> 39:17.211
So, we've got a big problem.

39:23.342 --> 39:24.427
All right, look.

39:24.594 --> 39:28.931
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

39:30.016 --> 39:31.559
I promise.

39:32.101 --> 39:35.313
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

39:35.772 --> 39:37.815
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow

39:37.899 --> 39:39.734
so I'm going to get some sleep.

39:42.737 --> 39:44.947
Right after I find my bed.

40:05.802 --> 40:06.844
Ow!

40:06.928 --> 40:09.096
Okay, what are you...

40:10.807 --> 40:12.850
Question, what are
they doing here?

40:13.476 --> 40:17.688
And follow up, if I may,
what are you doing here?

40:18.564 --> 40:20.775
Well, after
the incident last night,

40:20.983 --> 40:23.611
we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

40:23.945 --> 40:26.364
But when we got here,
you were asleep. What?

40:26.739 --> 40:27.907
Ew!

40:27.990 --> 40:30.451
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

40:30.535 --> 40:32.870
of telling
other people to go away.

40:33.037 --> 40:35.957
I know, but you looked so cozy.

40:36.123 --> 40:39.961
And it was cold outside, and we
just fell asleep. No harm done.

40:40.044 --> 40:43.422
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.

40:44.549 --> 40:48.261
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.806
Ew.

40:51.889 --> 40:54.225
Did you just...
In my bowl!

40:57.770 --> 40:59.146
Why do you have one of these?

40:59.230 --> 41:01.566
You don't even have a mustache.

41:03.276 --> 41:04.777
Okay, that's it!

41:04.860 --> 41:06.862
What? I thought
we made a deal last night.

41:07.196 --> 41:08.239
Yes, we did.

41:08.322 --> 41:10.700
And I said I wouldn't
chop down any more trees.

41:10.783 --> 41:12.827
And I said I was going
to keep an eye on you.

41:12.994 --> 41:14.996
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

41:17.707 --> 41:19.125
Breakfast is overrated.

41:21.460 --> 41:24.297
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.

41:24.380 --> 41:28.718
I got to go into town
and sell my Thneed.

41:29.969 --> 41:31.595
You chopped down
one of my trees

41:31.679 --> 41:33.431
to make that piece of garbage?

41:33.597 --> 41:34.682
Look at that...

41:35.016 --> 41:39.395
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.

41:39.645 --> 41:42.023
This is a revolutionary product

41:42.106 --> 41:44.483
that will change
the world as we know it.

41:45.151 --> 41:46.527
It has a million uses!

41:47.320 --> 41:50.323
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!

41:50.531 --> 41:52.992
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?

41:53.159 --> 41:56.120
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!

41:57.330 --> 41:58.622
But wait, there's more!

41:58.789 --> 42:00.374
Thanks to its
all-natural microfibers,

42:00.458 --> 42:02.918
the Thneed is
super-absorbent!

42:03.085 --> 42:04.587
It also works as a hat.

42:06.172 --> 42:07.673
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.

42:07.882 --> 42:09.967
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

42:10.843 --> 42:12.678
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.

42:12.762 --> 42:14.305
Good to know.

42:14.388 --> 42:18.851
Well, fortunately, you are not
the target market, weirdo.

42:19.018 --> 42:20.436
You're bringing a guitar?

42:20.561 --> 42:22.396
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.107
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!

42:25.191 --> 42:26.275
Yeah.

42:28.444 --> 42:31.989
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

42:32.073 --> 42:34.658
<i>A fine thing that all people...</i>

42:36.035 --> 42:37.703
Sit down, go on.

42:38.162 --> 42:40.664
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.

42:40.790 --> 42:42.708
<i>The Thneed is good</i>

42:42.958 --> 42:44.877
<i>The Thneed is great...</i>

42:44.960 --> 42:46.087
Hey!

42:49.632 --> 42:50.966
Or the second day.

42:52.343 --> 42:53.427
Hey!

42:53.511 --> 42:56.180
<i>Or the third,
or fourth, or fifth day.</i>

42:56.639 --> 42:59.433
Okay, that one
hit the tender spot.

43:00.643 --> 43:01.685
<i>Until finally...</i>

43:01.769 --> 43:03.312
That's it!
You know what?

43:03.395 --> 43:05.856
I'm done with this thing.

43:06.232 --> 43:07.691
Aw.

43:08.192 --> 43:10.152
My family was right.
I quit!

43:18.953 --> 43:20.621
Hey. Cool hat.

43:20.913 --> 43:23.249
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.

43:23.415 --> 43:25.751
That thing makes me
like you more.

43:34.844 --> 43:37.137
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?

43:37.346 --> 43:40.224
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.

43:40.558 --> 43:43.102
Turns out, it's ahead
of its time, I guess.

43:43.185 --> 43:46.605
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?

43:46.689 --> 43:48.691
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.

43:49.358 --> 43:50.442
What are we playing?

43:50.526 --> 43:54.280
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.

43:55.823 --> 43:56.949
Oh.

44:00.661 --> 44:02.162
<i>Pancake, the pancake</i>

44:04.039 --> 44:05.165
Up!

44:09.128 --> 44:11.422
Who is up for ninths?

44:12.047 --> 44:14.383
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

44:15.551 --> 44:16.719
Whoa!

44:16.802 --> 44:18.345
All right, pass them over.

44:18.596 --> 44:19.930
Yeah, see?

44:20.347 --> 44:22.016
What's going on?

44:30.357 --> 44:32.943
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.

44:40.409 --> 44:43.704
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

44:43.996 --> 44:47.416
<i>A fine thing
that all people need</i>

44:47.499 --> 44:50.878
<i>The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great</i>

44:51.170 --> 44:56.175
<i>Let's hope we're not too late</i>

44:57.634 --> 45:00.137
<i>It's a super trendy hat</i>

45:00.220 --> 45:04.224
<i>It's a tightrope for an acrobat</i>

45:04.308 --> 45:07.936
<i>A net for catching butterflies</i>

45:08.228 --> 45:13.025
<i>A thing we use for exercise</i>

45:14.651 --> 45:18.155
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

45:18.238 --> 45:21.742
<i>A fine thing
that all people need</i>

45:21.825 --> 45:24.370
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

45:24.453 --> 45:27.289
Oh, yeah!
We're in business, baby!

45:27.456 --> 45:29.917
<i>We need a Thneed</i>

45:30.167 --> 45:34.421
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!

45:34.630 --> 45:37.341
You need to bring the whole
family here right now.

45:37.424 --> 45:39.551
We're going to be rich!

45:40.260 --> 45:44.681
What? I'm going to need all the
help I can get. Don't worry.

45:45.766 --> 45:48.519
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?

45:48.811 --> 45:50.312
Actually, no.

45:50.395 --> 45:53.899
But I think he's going to get
to that part really soon.

45:54.942 --> 45:56.944
Here we are.
What?

45:57.736 --> 45:58.946
I'll just be a minute.

46:01.698 --> 46:03.867
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!

46:04.618 --> 46:06.537
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?

46:06.829 --> 46:09.915
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.

46:09.998 --> 46:11.917
Just me and my thoughts.

46:13.168 --> 46:15.546
Oh, is this the girl
you're always talking about?

46:15.629 --> 46:17.089
Grandma!
Stop making things up.

46:17.172 --> 46:19.842
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.

46:22.344 --> 46:25.097
Okay, Grammy,
let's get you home!

46:56.503 --> 46:57.629
Yeah!

46:59.715 --> 47:00.799
Whoa!

47:00.883 --> 47:02.885
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

47:04.219 --> 47:05.304
Did not wanna see that.

47:05.470 --> 47:06.597
Whoa!

47:10.517 --> 47:11.768
Whoa!

47:15.606 --> 47:16.940
Whoa-ho-ho!

47:23.530 --> 47:24.698
Hey!

47:30.120 --> 47:31.246
Hey, I'm back.

47:31.330 --> 47:32.664
What have you got there?

47:33.040 --> 47:34.124
Yes!

47:37.628 --> 47:38.795
Whoa!

47:41.632 --> 47:43.050
Thank you, Ted.

47:46.595 --> 47:47.638
Now, picture this.

47:48.305 --> 47:53.268
<i>Sun shining,
a blue sky, a perfect day.</i>

47:57.272 --> 48:00.150
<i>It was all downhill from there.</i>

48:17.876 --> 48:19.127
Whoa!

48:32.224 --> 48:33.934
What a dump.

48:34.101 --> 48:36.311
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

48:38.188 --> 48:40.232
Hey, Chet, check this out!

48:40.315 --> 48:41.358
Go long!

48:42.067 --> 48:43.944
No, Brett,
that's actually not a...

48:44.027 --> 48:45.070
Okay.

48:45.153 --> 48:46.822
Go long! Go long!

48:46.905 --> 48:48.365
I got it! I got it!

48:51.118 --> 48:52.160
Got it!

48:53.495 --> 48:55.622
He totally ran into that tree!

48:56.373 --> 48:57.457
Ow!

48:58.458 --> 49:00.460
Oncie, is that you?

49:00.544 --> 49:01.837
Mom!

49:01.920 --> 49:06.633
There he is! There's my big,
suddenly successful son!

49:08.593 --> 49:11.346
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?

49:12.055 --> 49:14.474
Hey! I love this guy!

49:14.850 --> 49:17.894
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?

49:18.103 --> 49:20.981
Hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you!

49:21.189 --> 49:23.024
I am really glad
that you clarified that

49:23.108 --> 49:26.111
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.

49:26.736 --> 49:30.532
Anyway, you're all here, you all
work for me, and that's cool.

49:30.615 --> 49:32.033
So, let's get to work.

49:32.701 --> 49:34.703
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!

49:34.786 --> 49:37.247
Would you stop
throwing that bear?

50:06.818 --> 50:10.697
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.

50:10.864 --> 50:11.990
You got to go. Goodbye.

50:12.324 --> 50:15.619
So, who invited
the giant, furry peanut?

50:15.744 --> 50:16.912
You calling me a peanut, huh?

50:16.995 --> 50:18.246
I'll go right up your nose!

50:19.372 --> 50:20.874
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

50:20.957 --> 50:22.042
You wouldn't hit a woman.

50:22.876 --> 50:24.377
That's a woman?

50:24.753 --> 50:27.172
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.

50:27.255 --> 50:29.424
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.

50:29.507 --> 50:32.677
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.

50:32.761 --> 50:36.556
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good
acquaintance, the Lorax.

50:36.723 --> 50:39.267
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.

50:39.434 --> 50:42.145
And on behalf
of the trees, get out!

50:43.438 --> 50:48.068
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.

50:48.193 --> 50:49.235
And I'm going to
need their help

50:49.319 --> 50:51.655
if my company is
going to get bigger. Okay?

50:51.905 --> 50:53.031
Bigger?

50:53.281 --> 50:56.534
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation any more.

50:56.701 --> 50:58.870
I got plans. Big plans!

50:59.037 --> 51:03.667
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!

51:05.752 --> 51:07.170
Which way does a tree fall?

51:07.712 --> 51:09.172
Uh, down?

51:09.923 --> 51:12.217
A tree falls the way it leans.

51:12.884 --> 51:15.512
Be careful which way you lean.

51:25.772 --> 51:28.608
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

51:29.442 --> 51:31.444
I am so proud of me.

51:32.028 --> 51:35.323
Oncie, we've got us
a little problem.

51:35.782 --> 51:36.866
Problem?

51:36.950 --> 51:38.159
Mmm-hmm.

51:38.243 --> 51:41.413
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.

51:41.621 --> 51:44.958
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long!

51:53.049 --> 51:54.884
Well, what else can we do?

51:55.051 --> 51:59.222
Well, and this just came to me,

51:59.389 --> 52:02.475
we could always start
chopping down the trees.

52:03.101 --> 52:04.269
What?

52:04.519 --> 52:07.313
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!

52:07.605 --> 52:09.107
But...
No "but" s, Oncie.

52:09.190 --> 52:10.650
You're running a business now.

52:10.859 --> 52:12.610
You have to do what's
best for the company,

52:12.694 --> 52:14.237
and your momma.

52:15.905 --> 52:20.034
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

52:21.411 --> 52:24.581
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!

52:24.831 --> 52:27.458
Hey! I love this guy!

52:37.218 --> 52:40.597
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.

52:41.139 --> 52:43.892
Take that, you stupid tree!

52:49.147 --> 52:51.191
Where do you
think you're going?

52:51.816 --> 52:54.611
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

52:55.987 --> 52:57.989
Oh, I'm sorry,

52:58.156 --> 53:01.451
but Mr. Once-ler's
not seeing anyone right now.

53:01.534 --> 53:02.827
Yeah, well,
he'll see me. So...

53:02.911 --> 53:04.412
Hey, keep your paws off me!

53:04.579 --> 53:06.497
Give me a reason, Shorty.

53:06.581 --> 53:08.291
Hey, you broke your promise.

53:08.374 --> 53:09.751
You're better than this.

53:09.959 --> 53:12.670
You gotta stop!
This is bad!

53:13.046 --> 53:15.632
Have a nice day!

53:19.218 --> 53:20.261
Bad?

53:20.428 --> 53:23.765
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.

53:24.307 --> 53:25.808
Do you think I'm bad?

53:26.142 --> 53:27.435
Thank you!

53:27.518 --> 53:30.438
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

53:30.521 --> 53:33.733
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

53:33.983 --> 53:35.360
What's his problem?

53:35.985 --> 53:37.111
See?

53:40.239 --> 53:42.492
Yeah, bad! Right.

53:54.087 --> 53:56.756
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

53:56.839 --> 53:58.925
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

53:59.008 --> 54:01.427
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:01.761 --> 54:03.846
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

54:03.930 --> 54:06.391
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:06.474 --> 54:08.768
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

54:08.851 --> 54:11.187
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:11.270 --> 54:13.314
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

54:13.564 --> 54:14.816
<i>Well, there's
a principle in nature</i>

54:14.899 --> 54:16.150
<i>Principle in nature</i>

54:16.234 --> 54:18.277
<i>That almost
every creature knows</i>

54:18.569 --> 54:19.737
<i>Called survival of the fittest</i>

54:19.821 --> 54:20.988
<i>Survival of the fittest</i>

54:21.072 --> 54:23.658
<i>And check it,
this is how it goes</i>

54:23.741 --> 54:25.952
<i>The animal that wins
gotta scratch and fight</i>

54:26.035 --> 54:28.162
<i>And claw and bite and punch</i>

54:28.413 --> 54:30.832
<i>And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't</i>

54:30.915 --> 54:35.670
<i>Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch</i>

54:36.045 --> 54:38.131
<i>Munch, munch, munch, munch,
munch I'm just sayin'</i>

54:38.214 --> 54:40.800
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:40.967 --> 54:43.094
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

54:43.177 --> 54:45.596
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:45.847 --> 54:47.932
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

54:48.015 --> 54:50.685
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:50.768 --> 54:52.895
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

54:52.979 --> 54:55.314
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

54:55.440 --> 54:57.650
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

54:57.733 --> 54:59.193
<i>There's a principle in business</i>

54:59.277 --> 55:00.319
<i>Principle in business</i>

55:00.403 --> 55:02.363
<i>That everybody knows is sound</i>

55:02.613 --> 55:05.158
<i>It says the people with the
money People with the money</i>

55:05.241 --> 55:07.452
<i>Make this
ever-loving world go round</i>

55:07.577 --> 55:10.079
<i>So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory</i>

55:10.163 --> 55:11.372
<i>I'm biggering my corporate sign</i>

55:11.456 --> 55:12.540
<i>Bigger, bigger!</i>

55:12.623 --> 55:15.126
<i>Everybody out there
You take care of yours</i>

55:15.960 --> 55:20.047
<i>I'll take care of
mine-mine-mine-mine-mine</i>

55:20.131 --> 55:21.424
<i>Shake that bottom line</i>

55:21.549 --> 55:23.509
<i>Let me hear you
say Smogulous Smoke!</i>

55:23.593 --> 55:24.760
<i>Smogulous Smoke!</i>

55:24.886 --> 55:27.138
<i>Schloppity-Schlopp!</i>

55:27.221 --> 55:30.475
<i>Complain all you want It's never,
ever, ever, ever gonna stop</i>

55:30.600 --> 55:31.976
<i>Stop!</i>

55:32.059 --> 55:34.562
<i>Come on,
how bad can I possibly be?</i>

55:34.645 --> 55:37.064
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

55:37.356 --> 55:39.442
<i>I'm just building the economy</i>

55:39.525 --> 55:42.153
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

55:42.236 --> 55:44.322
<i>Just look at me
petting this puppy</i>

55:44.405 --> 55:46.782
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

55:46.866 --> 55:49.285
<i>A portion of proceeds
goes to charity</i>

55:49.368 --> 55:51.662
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

55:51.746 --> 55:54.707
<i>How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!</i>

55:56.626 --> 55:59.212
<i>All the customers are buying</i>

56:01.547 --> 56:04.300
<i>And the money's multiplying</i>

56:06.510 --> 56:08.846
<i>And the PR people are lying</i>

56:11.390 --> 56:14.143
<i>And the lawyers are denying</i>

56:16.312 --> 56:18.731
<i>Who cares if
a few trees are dying?</i>

56:21.275 --> 56:23.444
<i>This is all so gratifying!</i>

56:23.611 --> 56:25.905
<i>How bad?</i>

56:26.072 --> 56:31.327
<i>How bad can this possibly be?</i>

57:12.660 --> 57:13.911
So, how are things?

57:14.662 --> 57:16.539
What are you doing here?

57:16.831 --> 57:20.543
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

57:20.668 --> 57:22.670
Or do you still need more?

57:22.753 --> 57:25.464
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

57:25.840 --> 57:30.428
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

57:32.304 --> 57:34.974
I told you,
that's not how it works.

57:35.182 --> 57:38.102
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

57:38.352 --> 57:41.021
I need you
to get out. Now!

57:41.939 --> 57:44.066
Why? Do I make
you uncomfortable?

57:44.150 --> 57:46.026
Remind you of
the promises you made?

57:46.444 --> 57:48.070
The man you used to be?

57:48.154 --> 57:49.196
You know what?

57:49.280 --> 57:52.742
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

57:52.992 --> 57:54.577
I have done nothing illegal.

57:54.660 --> 57:57.246
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

57:57.371 --> 58:00.499
and biggering, and turning more
Truff ula trees into Thneeds.

58:01.834 --> 58:04.795
And nothing is
going to stop me!

58:21.187 --> 58:23.022
Well, that's it.

58:23.189 --> 58:25.232
The very last one.

58:26.275 --> 58:28.777
That may stop you.

58:48.964 --> 58:51.634
Somebody sure made
a bundle on that thing.

58:51.717 --> 58:55.137
I wonder what the next million
dollar invention's going to be.

59:01.018 --> 59:04.063
Yeah, I wonder...

59:14.782 --> 59:18.452
Son, you have let me down.

59:18.619 --> 59:21.497
Brett, you are now
my favorite child.

59:40.641 --> 59:42.726
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

59:42.977 --> 59:46.897
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

59:47.940 --> 59:50.818
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

59:50.901 --> 59:52.903
they can't live here any more.

01:00:01.203 --> 01:00:02.746
So, I'm sending them off.

01:00:02.913 --> 01:00:04.373
Hopefully,
they'll be able to find

01:00:04.456 --> 01:00:06.375
a better place
out there somewhere.

01:00:10.295 --> 01:00:11.380
Melvin?

01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:14.883
Melvin...

01:00:15.926 --> 01:00:17.261
Hey, Pipsqueak...

01:00:21.473 --> 01:00:22.683
Hey...

01:01:34.713 --> 01:01:37.299
So, this is
really all your fault.

01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:39.301
You destroyed everything.

01:01:40.052 --> 01:01:41.386
Yes.

01:01:41.595 --> 01:01:43.847
And each day
since the Lorax left,

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:47.100
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

01:01:47.267 --> 01:01:51.605
staring at that word, "unless,"

01:01:52.397 --> 01:01:55.359
and wondering what it meant.

01:01:55.526 --> 01:01:57.277
But now I'm thinking...

01:01:57.694 --> 01:01:58.779
Well, maybe you're the reason

01:01:58.862 --> 01:02:01.156
the Lorax left that word there.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.493
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:08.163
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

01:02:08.455 --> 01:02:10.457
nothing is going to get better.

01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:12.918
It's not.

01:02:31.186 --> 01:02:33.397
The last Truff ula seed.

01:02:34.731 --> 01:02:36.900
You need to plant it, Ted.

01:02:37.192 --> 01:02:40.404
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees any more.

01:02:40.612 --> 01:02:41.905
Then make them care.

01:02:42.197 --> 01:02:45.450
Plant the seed in the middle of
town, where everyone can see.

01:02:45.867 --> 01:02:48.078
Change the way things are.

01:02:48.328 --> 01:02:50.789
I know it may seem
small and insignificant,

01:02:50.872 --> 01:02:53.166
but it's not about what it is,

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:55.502
it's about what it can become.

01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.045
That's not just a seed,

01:02:57.713 --> 01:03:00.215
any more than
you're just a boy.

01:03:08.473 --> 01:03:09.725
I won't let you down.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.061
I know.

01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:56.813
Hey, Audrey!

01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:58.440
Audrey!

01:03:59.441 --> 01:04:00.484
Ted?

01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:02.736
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:04.071
Wait, but...

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:05.739
My house, okay?

01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:09.284
Got to plant the seed.

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:11.912
Okay, we're going
to need water.

01:04:12.454 --> 01:04:14.039
And uh, something to dig with.

01:04:14.331 --> 01:04:16.082
Um, what do I have...
Ted?

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.376
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:20.295
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

01:04:20.378 --> 01:04:22.380
and I am not kidding with you!

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:31.097
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:33.642
the most powerful man in town.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.561
There he is!

01:04:36.812 --> 01:04:38.063
Hello, Ted.

01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:39.981
Uh...

01:04:40.065 --> 01:04:42.818
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:45.654
He knows his own
name and everything.

01:04:47.322 --> 01:04:50.575
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

01:04:50.659 --> 01:04:52.661
A delicious cookie.

01:04:54.496 --> 01:04:55.539
Wonderful.

01:04:55.622 --> 01:04:57.624
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.

01:04:57.707 --> 01:05:00.418
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

01:05:01.086 --> 01:05:04.548
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.

01:05:05.632 --> 01:05:07.092
I'll get your cookie.

01:05:08.843 --> 01:05:10.512
I know you have it, Ted.

01:05:10.595 --> 01:05:12.806
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

01:05:14.391 --> 01:05:15.559
Hand it over.

01:05:15.684 --> 01:05:16.893
I'm sorry...

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.187
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:19.396 --> 01:05:21.064
Really? Well, then...

01:05:21.231 --> 01:05:23.692
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

01:05:23.817 --> 01:05:24.901
No, no, no!

01:05:24.985 --> 01:05:26.736
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.113
No, you can't go up there!

01:05:28.196 --> 01:05:29.781
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.784
Hey!

01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.786
No, you can't come in my room!

01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:37.247
Find it!

01:05:43.253 --> 01:05:44.504
Find it!

01:05:45.338 --> 01:05:46.673
What is going on here?

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.468
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:51.886
Excuse me, down there!

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:54.264
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:57.600
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:00.145
Fine. Sorry.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:03.440
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:06.318
And my apologies, Ted.

01:06:08.987 --> 01:06:10.322
You be safe.

01:06:12.991 --> 01:06:14.451
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

01:06:14.534 --> 01:06:16.286
The seed! Where is it?

01:06:16.369 --> 01:06:17.495
Seed?

01:06:18.872 --> 01:06:19.956
Where's Grammy?

01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:24.044
It's alive!

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.799
I remember you.

01:06:30.675 --> 01:06:32.510
Ted, what...

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.644
Audrey!

01:06:44.022 --> 01:06:46.191
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!

01:06:47.192 --> 01:06:49.194
Ted, what is this about?

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:51.404
It's about this.

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.239
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:53.406 --> 01:06:56.117
Is that... Yes. The
last Truff ula seed.

01:06:56.284 --> 01:06:58.286
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

01:06:58.369 --> 01:07:00.163
where everyone can see it.

01:07:00.497 --> 01:07:02.207
I could just
kiss you right now!

01:07:06.211 --> 01:07:07.295
We don't have time for that.

01:07:07.587 --> 01:07:09.464
I don't know,
we have a little time.

01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:13.635
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:43.122
Maniac!
Hey!

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:46.543
Ah!

01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:49.754
Here it comes!

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:54.759
I'm going for it.

01:08:12.777 --> 01:08:14.237
Oh, hello!

01:08:27.292 --> 01:08:29.502
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.265
Whoa!

01:08:42.807 --> 01:08:44.975
<i>You won't get away
with this, boy!</i>

01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:46.560
Bam!

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.823
<i>Go faster, you idiot!</i>

01:08:59.866 --> 01:09:00.950
Yeah!

01:09:01.326 --> 01:09:03.161
Step on it, Ted!

01:09:03.786 --> 01:09:04.953
Whoa!

01:09:14.171 --> 01:09:16.006
You're fired!

01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:19.260
Whoa! Ted, look out!

01:09:22.889 --> 01:09:25.892
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

01:09:37.362 --> 01:09:38.821
This is not good.

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.865
How's it doing?

01:09:47.872 --> 01:09:48.956
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:09:51.626 --> 01:09:52.667
Loser!

01:09:52.752 --> 01:09:54.754
Oh, really?

01:09:56.381 --> 01:09:57.924
Oh, no. The seed!

01:10:01.052 --> 01:10:02.428
Get that seed!

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.853
Hang on! Here we go!

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.024
Grammy!

01:10:23.241 --> 01:10:25.827
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:34.335
No!

01:10:37.922 --> 01:10:39.006
Come on!

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:40.883
Yeah, that's right.

01:10:41.384 --> 01:10:42.468
There it is!

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:55.022
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:56.274
Ah!

01:11:02.321 --> 01:11:03.364
Hey, ow, ow!

01:11:04.156 --> 01:11:05.366
Oh, come on!

01:11:15.334 --> 01:11:16.460
What the...

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.298
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!

01:11:22.466 --> 01:11:24.135
Bring it on, Teddy!

01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:26.929
You don't have the guts!

01:11:27.638 --> 01:11:28.723
Ted!

01:11:36.272 --> 01:11:37.690
Grammy!

01:11:43.195 --> 01:11:44.238
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

01:11:47.033 --> 01:11:48.117
Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:48.284 --> 01:11:49.785
Hey! It's Mr. O...

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:53.706
Take that, shorty!

01:12:11.307 --> 01:12:13.517
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:16.312
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:21.484
No, Grammy...

01:12:27.239 --> 01:12:28.282
Hey, get out of there!

01:12:30.076 --> 01:12:31.160
Ah!

01:12:33.913 --> 01:12:34.997
Hey!

01:12:36.332 --> 01:12:38.209
What?

01:12:39.418 --> 01:12:42.129
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

01:12:42.588 --> 01:12:45.007
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

01:12:45.174 --> 01:12:47.301
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

01:12:48.594 --> 01:12:50.930
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

01:12:51.097 --> 01:12:52.181
A real one.

01:12:52.264 --> 01:12:53.682
Why would we need a tree?

01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:55.810
Exactly.

01:12:58.687 --> 01:13:00.106
Oh, man.

01:13:00.689 --> 01:13:01.774
Folks...

01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:06.112
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

01:13:06.278 --> 01:13:07.863
They're filthy!

01:13:08.114 --> 01:13:14.036
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:19.083
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.793
Hey!
Ouch.

01:13:20.876 --> 01:13:22.378
Think about the kids.

01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:27.049
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

01:13:27.216 --> 01:13:28.384
You know that, right?

01:13:28.467 --> 01:13:30.386
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:32.304
They just fall
wherever they want!

01:13:33.556 --> 01:13:35.766
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

01:13:35.975 --> 01:13:38.144
Because they produce fresh air.

01:13:38.227 --> 01:13:39.478
For free!

01:13:39.562 --> 01:13:41.188
Oh!

01:13:41.272 --> 01:13:45.025
I am wounded!
You have lied!

01:13:45.151 --> 01:13:48.779
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:51.073
Come on.
She's making that up!

01:13:51.157 --> 01:13:53.993
That's a
made-up word, people!

01:13:54.243 --> 01:13:57.955
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

01:13:58.122 --> 01:14:00.124
We don't need trees!

01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:02.668
That boy has a seed.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.671
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

01:14:05.796 --> 01:14:07.089
O'Hare is right!

01:14:07.339 --> 01:14:09.466
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

01:14:10.593 --> 01:14:13.220
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:15.014
Where do you think
you're going?

01:14:15.181 --> 01:14:16.640
Come on, let's go!

01:14:16.807 --> 01:14:18.851
Get in, get in!

01:14:20.686 --> 01:14:21.979
Hey!

01:14:22.104 --> 01:14:23.939
Stop that maniac!

01:14:25.774 --> 01:14:28.569
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

01:14:32.823 --> 01:14:35.492
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

01:14:35.659 --> 01:14:37.536
Yeah. I know.

01:15:01.393 --> 01:15:03.729
Wow. Did you see that?

01:15:04.438 --> 01:15:06.815
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:10.194
I am Ted Wiggins.

01:15:10.903 --> 01:15:13.155
And I speak for the trees.

01:15:13.822 --> 01:15:18.494
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

01:15:18.744 --> 01:15:20.162
And they're only
going to get worse,

01:15:20.245 --> 01:15:22.581
unless we do
something about it,

01:15:23.165 --> 01:15:25.334
unless we change our ways.

01:15:25.542 --> 01:15:28.796
And we can start
by planting this!

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.724
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

01:15:41.558 --> 01:15:42.685
Right?

01:15:42.768 --> 01:15:46.563
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

01:15:49.525 --> 01:15:51.193
People, come on!

01:15:54.947 --> 01:15:57.074
You! Get out there right now

01:15:57.157 --> 01:16:01.078
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

01:16:02.204 --> 01:16:04.957
Go on, tell them
what you think.

01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:12.631
<i>You don't know me,
but my name's Cy</i>

01:16:13.382 --> 01:16:17.594
<i>I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy</i>

01:16:17.761 --> 01:16:21.974
<i>But it seems like
trees might be worth a try</i>

01:16:22.224 --> 01:16:25.644
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:30.065
<i>My name is Dan</i>

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:31.358
<i>And my name's Rose</i>

01:16:31.442 --> 01:16:34.153
<i>Our son Wesley kind of glows</i>

01:16:34.403 --> 01:16:37.197
<i>And that's not good,
so we suppose</i>

01:16:37.281 --> 01:16:39.032
<i>We should let it grow</i>

01:16:39.116 --> 01:16:41.577
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.580
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:46.999
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:49.543
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

01:16:49.626 --> 01:16:52.171
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

01:16:52.421 --> 01:16:54.089
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:16:54.173 --> 01:16:56.592
<i>My name's Marie,
and I am three!</i>

01:16:56.925 --> 01:16:59.845
<i>I would really
like to see a tree</i>

01:17:02.514 --> 01:17:04.057
<i>I say let it grow</i>

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:07.519
<i>I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair</i>

01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:11.106
<i>But I remember when
trees were everywhere</i>

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:13.775
<i>And no one had to pay for air</i>

01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:15.611
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

01:17:15.694 --> 01:17:18.030
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

01:17:18.322 --> 01:17:21.366
<i>Like it did so long ago</i>

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:23.702
<i>It is just one tiny seed</i>

01:17:23.827 --> 01:17:26.205
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

01:17:26.288 --> 01:17:28.957
<i>It's time to change
the life we lead</i>

01:17:29.041 --> 01:17:30.792
<i>Time to let it grow</i>

01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:34.213
<i>My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you</i>

01:17:34.463 --> 01:17:39.218
<i>I live here in Thneedville, too</i>

01:17:39.384 --> 01:17:42.846
<i>The things you say
just might be true</i>

01:17:43.013 --> 01:17:46.308
<i>It could be time to start anew</i>

01:17:46.475 --> 01:17:51.480
<i>And maybe change
my point of view</i>

01:17:52.147 --> 01:17:55.025
Nah! I say let it die!

01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:57.194
<i>Let it die, let it die</i>

01:17:57.444 --> 01:17:59.112
<i>Let it shrivel up and...</i>

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:00.948
Come on, who's with me?

01:18:01.573 --> 01:18:02.741
Nobody.

01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:05.118
<i>You greedy dirt-bag!</i>

01:18:05.243 --> 01:18:07.746
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

01:18:07.829 --> 01:18:10.832
<i>Let the love inside you show</i>

01:18:10.916 --> 01:18:13.418
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

01:18:13.502 --> 01:18:15.504
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

01:18:15.587 --> 01:18:18.256
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

01:18:18.423 --> 01:18:22.678
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:18:22.844 --> 01:18:25.305
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

01:18:25.389 --> 01:18:28.850
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

01:18:28.934 --> 01:18:31.144
<i>It's just one tiny seed</i>

01:18:31.269 --> 01:18:33.605
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:35.857
<i>It's time to
banish all your greed</i>

01:18:35.941 --> 01:18:38.777
<i>Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed</i>

01:18:38.902 --> 01:18:43.907
<i>Let this be our solemn creed</i>

01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:46.660
Thank you, Ted.

01:18:47.786 --> 01:18:51.248
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:18:51.415 --> 01:18:53.834
<i>In Thneedville</i>

01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:57.546
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:18:57.629 --> 01:19:00.048
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

01:19:00.132 --> 01:19:03.635
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:05.470
<i>In Thneedville</i>

01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:09.307
<i>We say let it grow</i>

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:14.396
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:19.169
You done good, Beanpole.

01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:22.047
You done good.

01:20:35.685 --> 01:20:38.355
By the way, nice mustache.
