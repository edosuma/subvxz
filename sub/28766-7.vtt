WEBVTT

00:16.546 --> 00:17.671
I'm glad you came.

00:27.546 --> 00:28.546
Are you OK?

00:33.713 --> 00:34.921
Are you paid to be here?

00:39.046 --> 00:42.880
OK... I was going to tell you tonight.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.713
It's all true?

00:50.380 --> 00:51.671
So, it was all fake.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.088
The aquarium. Roger la Grenouille.

00:56.963 --> 00:58.046
My dad's couch.

00:59.213 --> 01:00.171
Boby Lapointe.

01:01.546 --> 01:02.713
You must have had fun.

01:05.255 --> 01:06.380
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06.463 --> 01:07.921
Because I would have lost you.

01:09.171 --> 01:10.380
I was caught off guard.

01:11.213 --> 01:12.296
What could I do?

01:12.505 --> 01:13.880
Does it matter? You lost me.

01:15.796 --> 01:17.963
But I must have made it easier for you.

01:18.046 --> 01:19.380
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:20.338 --> 01:23.463
I was so scared you wouldn't like me
that I didn't ask anything.

01:25.296 --> 01:27.880
-I'm such a fucking idiot...
-I'm being sincere.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.005
Elsa!

01:38.671 --> 01:39.713
I'm in love with you.

01:50.838 --> 01:53.380
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:53.463 --> 01:55.421
THE LAME PLAN

01:55.505 --> 01:57.171
THE CRAZY PLAN

01:57.255 --> 01:59.796
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:59.880 --> 02:01.755
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

02:11.046 --> 02:12.671
You're pissing <i>me</i> off, not Milou.

02:12.755 --> 02:15.505
Whatever. We can make noise now.

02:15.588 --> 02:18.005
The failure is late for her shitty job!

02:22.713 --> 02:23.713
What's this?

02:25.046 --> 02:26.546
I couldn't sleep.

02:26.838 --> 02:29.005
So, I worked all night. Well, "worked."

02:29.088 --> 02:31.171
I had another stupid idea: Pink Cars.

02:31.255 --> 02:32.755
Uber by women for women.

02:33.338 --> 02:34.338
Pink Cars?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.630
See, you think it's lame too.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.588
At least wait till I'm gone to laugh.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.338
A gift.

02:46.671 --> 02:48.671
Stop clomping around. I'm going crazy.

02:49.046 --> 02:50.088
Yes, OK.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.338
Thanks, Antoine, for the Weetabix!

02:59.255 --> 03:01.046
Milou, for fuck's sake!

03:05.505 --> 03:06.921
Love you, bro!

03:08.963 --> 03:09.963
It's hell. I'm sick of them.

03:19.588 --> 03:20.588
Oh, it's you?

03:20.921 --> 03:22.296
No, it's Catherine Deneuve.

03:30.255 --> 03:32.671
-Where are you going?
-To yoga. For real.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.296
That's how out of control I am.

03:36.838 --> 03:38.380
Now we both feel left behind.

03:39.838 --> 03:42.963
I know.
That's what you told Manon in those texts.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.296
OK, I kind of asked for it.
But we could have talked about it all.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.005
About Jules.

03:55.088 --> 03:57.005
About the construction site, about yoga.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.671
About Manon.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.380
I don't care about Manon. Honestly.

04:04.005 --> 04:05.046
You don't believe me? No.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.796
I don't believe in myself.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.755
I thought I could deal with it all.

04:13.088 --> 04:14.463
I feel like such a loser.

04:21.005 --> 04:22.005
Come here. Listen to me.

04:27.963 --> 04:31.088
The Emilie I love is a strong woman.

04:32.088 --> 04:33.755
A super talented architect.

04:34.505 --> 04:36.880
She makes me proud
to be the father of her child.

04:38.921 --> 04:41.963
She's not this selfish Emilie
who thinks only of herself.

04:42.671 --> 04:44.380
Who lies and destroys everything.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.380
I'll be careful. Thank you.

04:59.421 --> 05:01.880
DELETE PHOTO
CANCEL

05:05.088 --> 05:07.963
Right, Jules works the streets. So what?

05:08.588 --> 05:09.588
I'm sorry?

05:11.671 --> 05:15.630
You're on a date.
One of you pays the bill. Prostitution.

05:16.588 --> 05:20.505
In a club. A guy, or a girl,
gets bought a drink. Prostitution.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.796
At work. Sleeping with your boss.
Prostitution.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.130
-That's borderline.
-OK, bad example.

05:26.213 --> 05:28.755
-That's going too far.
-A little, but lighten up.

05:30.046 --> 05:31.171
I'm pathetic.

05:31.921 --> 05:33.713
Wow, you're good at lightening up.

05:33.796 --> 05:37.546
But how do I crawl out
of this loser's spiral?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.296
Chantal, I...

05:39.380 --> 05:41.921
It has to stop, it has to change.

05:43.505 --> 05:46.671
-That PR dick is the last thing we need!
-Elsa, we need to talk.

05:47.630 --> 05:50.671
-Oh, no...
-Or I'll talk and you don't have to.

05:51.213 --> 05:52.838
I'm on mat leave, I have time. -Please.
-No, no, no...

05:56.255 --> 05:57.255
Tell her no.

05:57.338 --> 06:00.005
Two minutes, they won't let me in.
Please, I miss you.

06:00.546 --> 06:02.088
Elsa, I beg you, come back.

06:02.171 --> 06:04.963
-I know I fucked up. Elsa!
-She can't hear you.

06:05.463 --> 06:06.463
Sorry.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.255
BIZET HOSPITAL

06:23.296 --> 06:24.296
What's up?

06:25.088 --> 06:27.755
Mehdi told me you taught him
to draw rockets.

06:28.171 --> 06:29.171
Well, yeah.

06:29.505 --> 06:31.296
He was struggling so I showed him.

06:33.005 --> 06:34.505
FOR MANON

06:34.588 --> 06:35.588
Oh, right.

06:36.421 --> 06:37.755
We need a different method.

06:37.838 --> 06:40.088
Right. His parents would appreciate that.

06:42.505 --> 06:43.505
I'm sorry. About Emilie.

06:46.421 --> 06:47.463
I know she came by.

06:48.296 --> 06:51.713
-She read our texts and I didn't want...
-Don't worry about it.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.421
Did you say anything?

06:54.505 --> 06:56.171
Did you tell her...

06:56.505 --> 06:57.505
The truth.

06:57.588 --> 06:58.838
So, nothing.

06:59.630 --> 07:02.005
Well, enough for her
not to want to come back.

07:04.088 --> 07:05.588
Your wife is sweet, you know.

07:14.296 --> 07:16.338
Free ice-cream tasting!

07:18.880 --> 07:20.588
Ice-cream tasting!

07:20.671 --> 07:21.671
Come on, ice...

07:22.671 --> 07:23.880
Fucking hell!

07:25.255 --> 07:26.421
Fuck!

07:26.880 --> 07:27.880
Are you OK? Are you coping?

07:30.421 --> 07:32.380
You came all the way to laugh at me?

07:37.755 --> 07:39.671
-Pink Cars.
-Oh, yeah, that.

07:39.755 --> 07:42.088
I've been thinking about it.
It's a great idea.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.630
-Yeah, whatever.
-I'm serious.

07:47.921 --> 07:49.588
-Madam, free ice--
-No, thanks.

07:49.671 --> 07:50.921
As if you were on a diet.

07:53.046 --> 07:54.755
Hey. I'll help you.

07:54.838 --> 07:57.088
-Do what? Sell dodgy ice cream?
-No!

07:58.505 --> 07:59.796
You really think it's good?

08:00.546 --> 08:02.838
Are you motivated to work
on the project or not?

08:03.755 --> 08:05.463
Maybe, I don't know. Forget it.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.546
Sir? Ice-cream tasting? Chili rose?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.921
-See? I'm useless!
-No, you're motivated.

08:11.005 --> 08:13.338
You're direct, you're frank, it's great.

08:13.421 --> 08:16.713
-Would saying "No, thanks" burn your ass?
-Maybe a little too frank.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.630
It's OK, we'll work on it.

08:19.963 --> 08:22.546
Are you saying that to make me happy?
To be "couply"?

08:22.963 --> 08:25.338
You're so fucking annoying,
you're unbearable.

08:34.421 --> 08:37.046
-Nice hat...
-Stop it!

09:01.171 --> 09:02.171
Jules? Jules Dupont?

09:04.880 --> 09:05.880
Himself.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.546
Right... Well, come in.

09:17.880 --> 09:18.880
<i>Let me talk to her.</i> Well...

09:22.380 --> 09:23.380
Yeah.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.380
So, what do I do now?

09:27.505 --> 09:30.046
Let me talk to her
so she can tell me herself.

09:30.713 --> 09:31.713
Karine? How are you?

09:38.421 --> 09:41.380
I'm sorry about Jules,
what happened with the girls.

09:41.796 --> 09:43.630
Don't be, it's not your fault.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.755
You're the only one who's not been a dick.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.963
I saw Milou came by?
I thought I saw her...

09:50.046 --> 09:51.046
She left.

09:54.421 --> 09:57.421
Is Karine not Gaïa's sister?

09:58.463 --> 09:59.755
She cancelled the wedding.

10:01.505 --> 10:02.505
Oh, right... Shoot, I...

10:04.421 --> 10:06.713
I'm the one who's sorry. Why?

10:06.796 --> 10:08.296
Too many doubts.

10:09.046 --> 10:11.421
That Gaïa may not be
as stupid as she looks.

10:14.130 --> 10:15.546
Have you got your coffee now?

10:18.255 --> 10:19.088
Sweetener.

10:22.463 --> 10:25.713
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.046
I don't fancy anything.

10:28.296 --> 10:29.296
Do you want to... Stirrer.

10:33.338 --> 10:34.755
And you're stirring here?

10:34.838 --> 10:36.338
I don't know if I want milk.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.463
Don't you want to talk to a friend?
I could do with that.

10:44.588 --> 10:45.421
Please. OK.

10:54.463 --> 10:55.463
Cool. OK, so...

10:57.921 --> 10:59.463
-I'll pick you up.
-OK.

11:00.755 --> 11:01.588
Great. What?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.588
It's all right, he's a mate now.

11:16.296 --> 11:17.213
Yeah.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.546
NEW MESSAGE TO: ROMAN

11:24.380 --> 11:27.088
CHANTAL: ELSA IS SEEING HER EX TONIGHT!

11:34.171 --> 11:35.171
Where are you going?

11:35.755 --> 11:38.296
To sell my suits and the scooter.
For rent money.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.796
I need to tell you something.

11:41.296 --> 11:42.296
I'm listening.

11:43.796 --> 11:44.838
It's about Elsa.

11:48.796 --> 11:51.130
We last fought just after your birthday.

11:51.213 --> 11:52.213
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.921
She thought there was
still something between us.

11:55.713 --> 11:56.713
Stupid, right?

11:57.463 --> 11:58.546
Yeah, it's... That's stupid.

12:00.255 --> 12:02.921
Then I told her
I'd never seen you look so beautiful.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.755
That's really stupid.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.463
But... thanks.

12:17.921 --> 12:19.296
Elsa? Elsa?

12:20.963 --> 12:23.505
I'll always be here for you.
You know that, right?

12:24.838 --> 12:25.671
Sorry.

12:26.588 --> 12:28.255
-Excuse me.
-No worries.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.713
My name is Julio Saldenha.

12:38.796 --> 12:39.630
Jules?

12:39.713 --> 12:42.838
I was born
on 24th September 1987. I'm 31.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.963
6 foot, 12.5 stone, Libra.

12:46.421 --> 12:47.421
Libra ascendant.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.880
I'm a man-whore, an escort, a gigolo.

12:51.963 --> 12:54.796
I did it to help my mom
and then I continued.

12:55.838 --> 12:58.463
160 euros an hour,
two hours a day for four years.

12:58.755 --> 13:02.005
-That's 573 clients aged 23 to 72.
-We're out of here.

13:02.088 --> 13:04.630
I support my mom and roommate
but they're not a burden.

13:04.713 --> 13:06.005
I have to pay my dad's debt,

13:06.088 --> 13:08.380
which will be hard,
as I've stopped everything.

13:11.130 --> 13:14.171
I have no diploma,
and even less experience.

13:14.838 --> 13:17.338
-And my mom will be homeless soon.
-That's enough.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.713
Wait! I control everything.

13:18.796 --> 13:20.921
I predict everything.
I separate everything.

13:21.380 --> 13:22.380
Except Miss Piggy. 43 days ago.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.713
She eats like an ogre,
laughs like a Viking, talks to the fish.

13:28.796 --> 13:30.213
She freaks me the hell out.

13:30.296 --> 13:32.255
-Thanks.
-But there you go.

13:32.838 --> 13:35.796
With a simple smile,
she makes me want to start over.

13:37.046 --> 13:39.755
If my dad was alive,
I'd tell him I'd met my dream girl.

13:43.380 --> 13:44.380
I got lost.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.046
But thanks to you,
I want to believe in myself again.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.380
Start over.

13:54.338 --> 13:55.463
We can start over.

14:07.963 --> 14:09.463
Good luck, Julio Saldenha.

14:10.755 --> 14:12.630
I hope it works out for you. Let's go.

14:16.338 --> 14:17.296
Elsa!

14:17.380 --> 14:19.630
Wait. I get that you need time to think.

14:19.713 --> 14:21.463
But I will wait for you.

14:21.546 --> 14:23.463
This isn't a rom com!

14:24.505 --> 14:26.130
Listen, next Thursday.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.296
Next Thursday, in a week, I'll wait here.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.171
Until close at 8 p.m.

14:30.755 --> 14:33.921
Until close, please,
and if you don't come, I'll disappear.

14:35.171 --> 14:36.171
Next Thursday! Hi, honey.

14:50.463 --> 14:52.338
THURSDAY / FRIDAY

15:30.046 --> 15:31.046
I'M EXPECTING A BABY FRIDAY / SATURDAY

15:43.088 --> 15:43.921
Hello?

15:50.046 --> 15:51.421
SATURDAY / SUNDAY

16:43.796 --> 16:45.630
WEDNESDAY / THURSDAY

17:09.255 --> 17:10.796
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

17:13.588 --> 17:15.380
WHY, WHERE ARE YOU?

17:17.046 --> 17:18.755
CITY HALL, BY THE FOUNTAINS

17:24.338 --> 17:25.921
So, this guy is waiting for you.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.380
And you ditched him.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.213
Yes. Him and...

17:34.421 --> 17:35.421
everyone else. What?

17:42.671 --> 17:44.046
I'm leaving, Anaïs.

17:45.463 --> 17:47.296
Far away. Like you did.

17:47.713 --> 17:50.338
-You can't do that, my dumpling.
-Stop that already!

17:50.421 --> 17:51.421
OK!

17:57.296 --> 17:59.213
Trust me, it won't solve your problems.

18:00.088 --> 18:01.088
I know but I...

18:02.296 --> 18:05.880
I want to create my own problems,
I'm tired of people deciding for me.

18:06.338 --> 18:07.338
I...

18:07.963 --> 18:10.088
-I'm stagnating.
-Huh?

18:14.046 --> 18:15.046
I'm a sole.

18:16.380 --> 18:17.546
A sole?

18:17.630 --> 18:21.130
Yes, you know, the fish that hides
at the bottom of the sea.

18:21.213 --> 18:23.171
I'm the same, I hide.

18:23.255 --> 18:25.171
I hide behind Mom and Dad.

18:25.255 --> 18:27.296
At work, behind Maxime, I...

18:27.963 --> 18:30.505
I'm a hider. A hider. I...

18:33.713 --> 18:36.463
Gosh, it looks like
that needed to come out.

18:36.963 --> 18:37.963
Come here. My love...

18:44.463 --> 18:46.338
Thanks for coming to see me this time.

18:48.088 --> 18:49.130
It does me good.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.838
Me too.

18:56.130 --> 18:57.505
-You know what?
-What?

18:58.421 --> 18:59.671
-Go.
-No.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.046
Go and ask him for his side of the story.

19:03.213 --> 19:05.505
If he wants to see you,
there must be something.

19:05.588 --> 19:08.213
-Apart from all your things.
-Stop it! No.

19:08.296 --> 19:09.505
Go back to Daddy's, then.

19:09.588 --> 19:12.005
Listen to a sad song,
have a good cry and then go.

19:12.088 --> 19:13.838
-No!
-You've got nothing to lose!

19:16.255 --> 19:17.255
Oh, boy!

19:18.171 --> 19:20.088
Shit! You're going to miss your flight.

19:20.588 --> 19:21.588
We need to go. Elsa!

19:41.630 --> 19:43.588
SORRY, ELSA

20:15.213 --> 20:16.213
Hey. OK.

20:25.005 --> 20:26.005
Elsa won't come.

20:27.088 --> 20:29.838
-She wants to forget you.
-How would you know?

20:31.463 --> 20:33.588
-You won't give up, will you?
-No.

20:35.338 --> 20:37.255
Too bad, I'd prepared some money.

20:37.963 --> 20:39.671
You know, to tide you over.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.213
So you disappear out of her life.

20:43.505 --> 20:46.088
-But you wouldn't have accepted, right?
-No.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.588
And your mother...

20:50.130 --> 20:52.046
Would she accept a City Hall flat?

20:52.713 --> 20:55.338
Capped rent. Nice location.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.588
What are you playing at?

20:57.421 --> 20:58.880
Is this a quarter-life crisis?

21:00.005 --> 21:03.255
You were engaged but couldn't deal
with your ex seeing someone else.

21:04.255 --> 21:05.380
What's that about?

21:06.088 --> 21:08.380
I know guys like you. You know why?

21:08.921 --> 21:10.338
Their girlfriends pay for me.

21:14.046 --> 21:15.213
Maybe you're right.

21:16.255 --> 21:17.546
Maybe I am a dick.

21:18.338 --> 21:20.046
But I've known Elsa for 13 years.

21:20.588 --> 21:21.755
I know her by heart.

21:22.463 --> 21:24.755
And you're making her suffer like a dog.

21:25.296 --> 21:27.380
I gave her a hard time too but you...

21:27.463 --> 21:29.213
Fuck! You're destroying everything.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.213
Her self-esteem, her bearings.

21:32.630 --> 21:36.130
You even separated her
from her best mates, her sisters.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.755
And that's not about to improve.

21:39.088 --> 21:41.963
-I don't get it, what do you want?
-What do <i>you</i> want?

21:43.088 --> 21:44.338
You don't love Elsa. You want to own her.

21:47.296 --> 21:49.130
Except the Elsa you knew has changed.

21:50.213 --> 21:53.171
And you won't accept
that she's better off without you.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.255
What can you offer her?

21:59.296 --> 22:02.130
Huh? You know nothing apart from hustling.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.588
You can't even make your loved ones happy.

22:06.421 --> 22:08.713
Do you really want
to involve Elsa in that shit?

22:20.255 --> 22:22.755
I really went. Crazy, right?

22:23.296 --> 22:24.963
I went to yoga.

22:25.796 --> 22:28.880
But don't get too excited,
I've never been so bored.

22:29.421 --> 22:33.213
And you should see the other students
with their tight Buddhist nympho asses...

22:36.088 --> 22:37.088
Anyway...

22:37.630 --> 22:40.796
Apparently, I do the butterfly
and lightning bolt quite well so...

22:41.921 --> 22:42.921
I'm trying.

22:44.671 --> 22:46.338
It's a good start, right?

22:48.505 --> 22:50.963
You'll need to tell your daddy.

23:10.838 --> 23:11.838
SORRY, ELSA

23:11.921 --> 23:13.755
So, you have threats...

23:15.380 --> 23:16.380
opportunities... strengths...

23:21.671 --> 23:22.671
weaknesses.

23:24.338 --> 23:27.546
Bit of a pain but it's the basics.
You kind of have to do it.

23:27.630 --> 23:29.296
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.338
-It's nothing.
-No, but...

23:31.838 --> 23:33.713
It's true, though, studying,

23:33.796 --> 23:34.880
traveling,

23:36.630 --> 23:37.796
working,

23:37.880 --> 23:39.255
I don't really relate.

23:39.671 --> 23:41.463
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

23:41.880 --> 23:46.005
This is two years of business school,
a couple of books on marketing, it's nada.

23:46.588 --> 23:49.463
-Your talent is priceless.
-Yeah...

23:50.171 --> 23:51.880
You can sell ice cream to anyone.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.755
You smash every job you get.

23:54.213 --> 23:56.713
You have the gift of the gab,
you're radiant.

23:56.796 --> 23:58.463
People want to listen to you.

23:59.880 --> 24:00.880
That's priceless. That's talent.

24:03.046 --> 24:04.171
You can't learn that.

24:04.713 --> 24:07.255
So, what could your threats be?

24:09.130 --> 24:10.130
Uber. Potentially.

24:12.130 --> 24:13.130
G7 Taxis.

24:15.463 --> 24:18.005
Strengths. What are your strengths?

24:19.546 --> 24:20.963
-Your strengths?
-My concept.

24:21.046 --> 24:22.421
Your concept. Pink Cars.

24:30.088 --> 24:31.963
-Here.
-Thanks, Daddy.

24:33.755 --> 24:35.838
DELETE

24:47.005 --> 24:48.421
Back to square one.

24:50.546 --> 24:51.838
Things will work out.

24:54.296 --> 24:55.296
They meant well.

24:58.838 --> 25:00.463
What if he was a good guy?

25:03.671 --> 25:05.380
Why are you talking about him?

25:05.463 --> 25:07.713
You've been going around
in circles for a week.

25:10.463 --> 25:12.755
Only Jules can answer your questions.

25:12.838 --> 25:15.380
So, if I were you, I'd go and see him.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.380
