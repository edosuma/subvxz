00:13.013 --> 00:15.947
I'm Wolf Blitzer.
This studio is my home.

00:15.949 --> 00:19.751
I'm standing inches from my bed.
Let's go live to

00:19.752 --> 00:21.986
the Conservative
Political Action Conference,

00:21.988 --> 00:23.654
where President Trump is speaking

00:23.656 --> 00:26.857
while avoiding eye contact
with the breakfast buffet.

00:26.859 --> 00:28.892
Good morning, supporters,

00:28.894 --> 00:32.095
disgraced sheriffs,
spineless pastors,

00:32.097 --> 00:33.664
French Nazis,

00:33.665 --> 00:37.201
and, of course,
schizophrenic YouTubers!

00:37.203 --> 00:40.971
People are saying the Republican
party lacks integrity,

00:40.973 --> 00:44.340
and I say, "Don't you talk
about Mitt Romney like that!"

00:44.342 --> 00:47.109
Welcome to my
endorsement club, Mitt.

00:47.111 --> 00:50.346
You're seated next to Roy
Moore and his "nieces."

00:50.348 --> 00:53.115
As a Mormon,
Mitt can't drink coffee,

00:53.117 --> 00:56.118
but apparently,
he can spit-shine my nipples

00:56.120 --> 00:59.487
all the way to the
United States Senate!

00:59.489 --> 01:01.122
<i> Party of Lincoln!</i>

01:01.124 --> 01:02.924
But look.
I want to make sure

01:02.926 --> 01:05.827
that only mentally stable people
can buy a gun

01:05.829 --> 01:07.363
that would've single-handedly

01:07.364 --> 01:09.797
brought the Roman empire
to its knees.

01:09.799 --> 01:12.000
That's why I consulted the top minds

01:12.002 --> 01:14.002
near the Mar-A-Lago
wet-towel bin ...

01:14.004 --> 01:15.936
three buck-naked guys
named Murray.

01:15.938 --> 01:18.505
And Murray, with
the second-biggest dong,

01:18.507 --> 01:20.607
mentioned that Australia
banned big guns,

01:20.609 --> 01:25.080
and now it's overrun with scorpions
and crocodiles! Not much better.

01:25.081 --> 01:29.216
Speaking of reptiles, NRA
sweetheart Wayne LaPierre is here.

01:29.218 --> 01:30.985
Waiter, bring Wayne a wet nap.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.986
He's got blood all over his hands.

01:32.988 --> 01:35.521
Do you know how complicit
Wayne LaPierre is?

01:35.523 --> 01:37.723
<i>How complicit is he?!</i>

01:37.725 --> 01:39.926
Wayne LaPierre is so complicit,

01:39.928 --> 01:42.996
Poland just made it illegal
to talk about him.

01:42.998 --> 01:46.332
Ah, we love Wayne, don't we?
Good guy with a tough job.

01:46.334 --> 01:48.868
Devin Nunes!
Get him a seltzer, will you?

01:48.870 --> 01:50.502
Hurry up, you putz!

01:53.595 --> 01:56.442
<b>1x04 - Family Leave</b>

01:56.443 --> 01:57.977
<i>Cool.</i>

02:05.920 --> 02:08.585
You know,
the mainstream media

02:08.586 --> 02:11.422
makes it sound like
no women support me.

02:11.424 --> 02:16.227
But did you know that 52%
of white women voted for me?

02:16.229 --> 02:18.595
That means, between Hillary and Chelsea,

02:18.597 --> 02:21.132
I got one of them
and 2% of the other.

02:21.134 --> 02:23.767
And here's a white woman who
doesn't just make children,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.969
she makes jobs for children.

02:25.971 --> 02:30.606
Please welcome America's
daughter, Ivanka Trump!

02:32.644 --> 02:35.946
American working women,
after far too many years,

02:35.948 --> 02:38.781
are finally being judged
for what they can do,

02:38.783 --> 02:42.818
- not just for their appearance.
- Isn't she beautiful, folks?!

02:42.820 --> 02:45.020
Give 'em a twirl, honey!
Come on!

02:46.824 --> 02:50.392
And that means more women
than ever are getting jobs.

02:50.394 --> 02:52.894
Right, ladies?
Woot, woot.

02:52.896 --> 02:56.231
That's why programs such as
paid family leave are so vital.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.673
- Uh, the end.
- Wow! I don't know

02:59.708 --> 03:01.169
what the hell she was talking about,

03:01.171 --> 03:03.537
but she looked good
doing it, right, folks?

03:06.818 --> 03:09.085
<i>♪ Three white people on a couch ♪</i>

03:09.087 --> 03:11.487
<i>♪ It's "Fox & Friends" ♪</i>

03:11.489 --> 03:13.422
<i>Did you see Donald
and Ivanka's rally?</i>

03:13.424 --> 03:15.991
<i>What a great relationship
between those two!</i>

03:15.993 --> 03:17.260
<i>I tell you, watching that rally</i>

03:17.261 --> 03:19.294
<i>was the best thing

03:19.296 --> 03:21.496
<i>since I learned where to

03:21.498 --> 03:25.033
<i>No kidding. I've never been in
a more flammable back seat.</i>

03:25.035 --> 03:27.602
Wow! They all really
liked it, Daddy.

03:27.604 --> 03:29.571
Yeah, but Kilmeade's
the one that matters.

03:29.573 --> 03:32.006
He swallowed
two Daytime Emmys.

03:32.008 --> 03:35.542
Jared, can you believe
Chelsea Clinton got invited

03:35.544 --> 03:38.379
to the Glamour Woman of the
Year Awards and I didn't?

03:38.381 --> 03:40.081
And the Bush twins got invited

03:40.083 --> 03:42.549
to Sheryl Sandberg's
Festival of "Leaning."

03:42.551 --> 03:46.354
WhatTheHell.com, promo code
"bullshit" is going on here?

03:46.356 --> 03:49.340
Gee, uh, I can't believe your entire
social circle's turning against you

03:49.341 --> 03:52.325
just because your dad made
eating Taco Bell a subversive act.

03:52.327 --> 03:56.196
Okay. So my dad said some
naughty things about Mexicans.

03:56.198 --> 03:58.865
That doesn't mean
I believe those facts.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.201
So, here's what I'm thinking, Ivanka.

04:01.203 --> 04:03.536
You, me, tour bus ...
Ivanka/Donald Road Show.

04:03.538 --> 04:06.071
You know, just sort of
bounce back and forth

04:06.073 --> 04:11.277
- between Skokie and Charlottesville.
- Uhh... I'd love to,

04:11.279 --> 04:13.946
but between making the future
female and hustling 24/7,

04:13.948 --> 04:16.815
I'm booked solid.

04:16.817 --> 04:19.985
- Daddy?
- Sorry. You lost me at "book."

04:19.987 --> 04:23.121
But I heard enough to know that
you don't want to go. Fine.

04:23.123 --> 04:25.223
More frothed-up mobs for me.

04:25.225 --> 04:28.726
Daddy, do we have to do this
in front of everyone?

04:28.728 --> 04:30.962
Honey, there are no leaks
in this room.

04:30.964 --> 04:34.799
The media only gets quotes from
unnamed White House sources.

04:34.801 --> 04:38.002
I filled my Cabinet with nothing
but people who have names.

04:38.004 --> 04:40.003
Dad, I'm the only one of your kids

04:40.005 --> 04:42.272
you've never had to bail
out of SeaWorld jail,

04:42.274 --> 04:44.607
so the least you can do is
allow me to protect the company

04:44.609 --> 04:47.644
I worked so hard to pay
other people to create!

04:47.646 --> 04:49.213
I love moments like this that bring

04:49.214 --> 04:51.248
my 40 years of military service to bear,

04:51.250 --> 04:53.984
but I just want to remind you
that our intelligence indicates

04:53.986 --> 04:59.021
that a Turkish splinter group
is trying to obtain a nuclear warhead.

04:59.023 --> 05:00.722
Hey, so long as they don't hit Skokie

05:00.724 --> 05:02.292
and Charlottesville, we're good.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.597
- Sir?
- Sorry. It's only a jumbo size.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.000
No, sir. These two ...
what are they doing here?

05:11.002 --> 05:13.669
Oh, them?
Well, as I'm sure you all know,

05:13.671 --> 05:17.538
since you visit IvankaTrump.com
every morning like I ordered,

05:17.540 --> 05:21.109
my daughter's busy launching her
new line of cowl-neck sweaters.

05:21.111 --> 05:23.478
I hear cowl necks are gonna be
hot this year, Mr. President!

05:23.480 --> 05:26.614
Anyway, she's out, they're in.
Just pretend they aren't here.

05:26.616 --> 05:29.217
- Worked for me for 18 years.
- Fine.

05:29.219 --> 05:31.718
Let's begin with the contested
territory of Turkestan ...

05:31.720 --> 05:34.621
- What are our options?
- I didn't say what the problem was.

05:34.623 --> 05:36.857
We should send in SEAL Team Six!

05:36.859 --> 05:39.759
It's too risky, Eric!
Those soldiers have families!

05:39.761 --> 05:41.761
Well, if we don't do something now,

05:41.763 --> 05:44.965
tomorrow, those territorials
will be at our goddamn door!

05:44.967 --> 05:47.334
What the hell are you two
talking about?

05:47.336 --> 05:49.668
We're talking about the
future of the free world.

05:49.670 --> 05:51.971
We're talking about the land
General Washington saw

05:51.973 --> 05:53.906
when he crested
the Rocky Mountains,

05:53.908 --> 05:56.675
the land that inspired him
to turn to Lincoln and say,

05:56.677 --> 05:59.345
"Holy shit.
Can you believe this shit?

05:59.347 --> 06:01.214
This place is dope.
Was that a yak?

06:01.216 --> 06:03.282
Did I just invent the word 'yak'?"

06:03.284 --> 06:07.085
So I will ask you again ...
are you in or are you out?

06:07.087 --> 06:09.821
- I'm in!
- McMaster! You just ...

06:09.823 --> 06:13.158
Mr. President,
patch things up with Ivanka.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.994
<i>Are you staying up
to see if Brian Kilmeade</i>

06:15.996 --> 06:17.996
<i>eats the cookies and milk
you left on the TV?</i>

06:17.998 --> 06:20.899
I miss when she and I would
go to fancy benefits

06:20.901 --> 06:22.866
for whatever progressive cause

06:22.868 --> 06:25.002
rich people were paying
lip service to that week.

06:25.004 --> 06:27.604
Maybe Ivanka would want to
spend more time with you

06:27.606 --> 06:31.308
if your views weren't so...
against hers?

06:32.512 --> 06:35.846
You're right. There comes
a time in every presidency

06:35.848 --> 06:38.782
when he must choose between
the love of his daughter

06:38.784 --> 06:40.450
and the satisfaction of making

06:40.452 --> 06:43.886
an incendiary nationalist
powder keg go kaboom.

06:43.888 --> 06:46.856
It's a choice I must make alone.

06:46.858 --> 06:48.658
Give me till dawn.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.029
Tell me what to do.

06:53.031 --> 06:56.465
Tell me how a president
balances his family life

06:56.467 --> 06:59.801
with his obligation to demonize
the margins of society.

06:59.803 --> 07:01.204
<i>I love you, Daddy!</i>

07:01.205 --> 07:03.905
<i>Jews will not replace us!</i>

07:03.907 --> 07:06.608
What would you do?

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here

07:16.752 --> 07:21.556
Melania, I'm going to abandon
my previously held beliefs

07:21.558 --> 07:24.125
in service of what I want right now.

07:24.127 --> 07:26.260
I'm going to be so progressive

07:26.262 --> 07:28.796
that my daughter
has to take me back.

07:28.798 --> 07:31.664
Thanks, George.

07:36.938 --> 07:40.607
Look, we need ideas to
win over women like Ivanka.

07:40.609 --> 07:42.775
So what do women want?
Stephen Miller.

07:42.777 --> 07:44.811
To be demeaned and then seduced!

07:44.813 --> 07:48.614
To just be friends until things
get less crazy for them at work!

07:48.716 --> 07:53.419
The thing about women is they
have delightfully large feet,

07:53.421 --> 07:57.556
and so what they're really
looking for is ankle kickstands

07:57.558 --> 07:59.625
to make sure they do not fall

07:59.627 --> 08:02.328
when walking on the side
of windy rivers.

08:02.330 --> 08:05.230
I know I'm only
Second Lady Karen Pence,

08:05.232 --> 08:08.899
but women just want a paperboy
who doesn't look like he swears,

08:08.901 --> 08:12.970
Enya on the Discman, and, on
the occasional Thursday night,

08:12.972 --> 08:16.108
a movie with Richard Gere!
Ooh!

08:16.109 --> 08:18.843
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God! I love Mr. Gere!

08:18.845 --> 08:20.212
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

08:20.213 --> 08:22.779
I'm not gonna let this devolve
into another Gere-fest.

08:22.781 --> 08:24.881
Mr. President,
Ivanka passed along

08:24.883 --> 08:27.184
a proposal in support
of paid family leave.

08:27.186 --> 08:30.053
I would've given it to you,
but it only had one picture,

08:30.055 --> 08:33.722
and due to its lack of cool
spaceships, I chose not to share it.

08:33.725 --> 08:36.961
Mm. Paid family leave.
Would women want that?

08:36.962 --> 08:39.094
Speaking as a woman ...

08:39.096 --> 08:41.664
- Definitely!
- They're gonna love it!

08:41.666 --> 08:44.987
They'll take what we give
them, and they'll like it.

08:46.437 --> 08:49.639
<i>President Trump's come out in
support of a paid family leave bill.</i>

08:49.641 --> 08:52.775
<i>Working moms shouldn't risk
bankruptcy to care for babies.</i>

08:52.777 --> 08:55.544
It's called family values, people.

08:55.546 --> 08:57.412
And you know what
the Democrats want?

08:57.414 --> 09:00.148
To use babies on Big Wheels
to deliver kale smoothies

09:00.150 --> 09:03.085
to their ivory-tower loft parties
where they're watching TED talks

09:03.086 --> 09:06.120
and listening to NPR about
how genders are fluid?

09:06.122 --> 09:07.855
You got all that right.

09:07.857 --> 09:11.493
And they also want babies
to be taken care of...

09:11.495 --> 09:14.895
- by the unions.
- Brian, you're awfully quiet over there.

09:14.897 --> 09:17.331
Tell the people your thoughts
on paid family leave.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.068
I'm just trying to wrap
the old noggin around

09:20.069 --> 09:22.803
why we're okay with moms
taking Trump's handouts

09:22.805 --> 09:25.072
and we call moms who
accept other handouts

09:25.074 --> 09:26.641
crack-addicted parasites.

09:26.642 --> 09:29.609
We'll let you get back to that!

09:29.611 --> 09:31.578
After the break, a creationist chef

09:31.580 --> 09:33.513
teaches us how to un-kosher beef.

09:36.751 --> 09:40.253
We need parents taking care
of babies, people. Am I right?

09:40.255 --> 09:42.255
I mean, right now,
babies get sick,

09:42.257 --> 09:43.657
Mommy and Daddy are at work,

09:43.658 --> 09:46.592
baby puts on a hat and coat
and hitchhikes to treatment.

09:46.594 --> 09:49.428
No good. This one's
personal for me, folks.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.730
Eric got the sniffles
when he was a baby,

09:51.732 --> 09:54.032
so I dunked his head
in a bucket of Robitussin.

09:54.034 --> 09:55.834
Imagine if I wasn't there.

09:55.836 --> 09:58.737
The world would've been robbed
of those beautiful gums!

09:58.739 --> 10:03.375
Speaking of beautiful, Ivanka,
come on up, honey. Come on.

10:03.376 --> 10:06.310
Family is the foundation of society.

10:06.312 --> 10:09.480
Without family, there can
be no "family" subsection

10:09.482 --> 10:13.150
on your e-commerce website.
Applause.

10:13.152 --> 10:15.486
We're reporters, ma'am.

10:15.488 --> 10:17.021
Pretty quiet out there today, Bri.

10:17.022 --> 10:20.257
For a guy without any lips, you
sure know how to keep yours sealed.

10:20.259 --> 10:21.559
Sorry, Doocy.
I-It's just ...

10:21.560 --> 10:24.527
I'm having trouble understanding
the logic of Trump's bill.

10:24.529 --> 10:27.631
Is it called "paid family leave"
because it gives businesses

10:27.633 --> 10:29.666
the power to deny employees
birth control

10:29.668 --> 10:32.068
even after they leave the company?

10:32.070 --> 10:34.237
Because I can praise that for days.

10:34.239 --> 10:36.873
Brian, the best way to
understand our President

10:36.875 --> 10:39.508
isn't through logic ...
it's through faith.

10:39.510 --> 10:41.710
Right.
If the President is doing it,

10:41.712 --> 10:43.280
he must be doing it for a reason.

10:43.281 --> 10:45.356
It can't just be random.

10:45.391 --> 10:47.441
Because if it is...

10:50.053 --> 10:51.887
Guh! Oh, God.

10:51.889 --> 10:53.622
Pull yourself together, Kilmeade!

10:54.224 --> 10:57.124
Sir, I don't know how
else to say this,

10:57.126 --> 10:59.761
but a Turkish splinter group
has gained control

10:59.763 --> 11:02.163
of a fully operational
nuclear missile silo.

11:02.165 --> 11:05.333
- Yipes!
- If the group detect any resistance,

11:05.335 --> 11:07.001
they've vowed
to send those birds

11:07.003 --> 11:09.370
straight to New York City,
Los Angeles,

11:09.372 --> 11:11.838
and Colonial Williamsburg
for some reason.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.774
Should we send in SEAL Team Six

11:13.776 --> 11:16.410
and potentially lose
two metropolitan cities

11:16.412 --> 11:18.845
and a bunch of butter-churners,

11:18.847 --> 11:23.550
or do the unthinkable and launch
a preemptive nuclear strike?

11:23.552 --> 11:26.553
Uh-huh...
Ivanka, you want to take this one?

11:26.555 --> 11:28.354
Whoa! Hold on, sir!

11:28.356 --> 11:30.690
Let me just remind you
the stakes here.

11:30.692 --> 11:35.361
We are about to either stop
World War III or cause it.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.830
And the Oscar goes to...

11:37.832 --> 11:40.433
You could've just said
it's kind of important.

11:40.435 --> 11:43.402
How exclusive is
Turkish splinter group?

11:43.404 --> 11:46.237
Like Soho House
or Harvard Club?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.940
Mr. Trump, I've managed
to hold my tongue

11:48.942 --> 11:52.677
out of respect for the office,
but now that we're about to die,

11:52.679 --> 11:56.280
I got something I've wanted to
say for a long, long time.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.351
You, sir, are without a doubt
the single most ...

11:59.353 --> 12:01.553
<i>Stand down.
Target neutralized.</i>

12:01.555 --> 12:03.754
Everybody, shut up!

12:03.756 --> 12:06.957
General Kelly was in the middle
of giving me a compliment.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.992
<i>And we're out!
Back in 30!</i>

12:08.994 --> 12:11.562
Ainsley, you wouldn't believe
where I saw Brian this morning.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.098
There was lightning and thunder ...
a storm so violent,

12:14.099 --> 12:15.165
it was practically Biblical.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.834
And I look over,
and there's Bri Guy

12:16.836 --> 12:19.569
standing in the middle of
the street in his skivvies!

12:19.571 --> 12:21.971
- You okay, Bri?
- Of course I'm not okay.

12:21.973 --> 12:24.507
Since he won the
Republican nomination,

12:24.509 --> 12:26.342
we've supported Donald Trump,

12:26.344 --> 12:28.544
and he's given us no reason not to.

12:28.546 --> 12:31.447
But then he pushes this
paid family leave bill,

12:31.449 --> 12:33.349
pulling the ground out
from under me

12:33.351 --> 12:35.918
and leaving me in a total
spiritual free fall!

12:35.920 --> 12:38.520
Whoa! Bri! Wear a tie,
say prompter, go home ...

12:38.522 --> 12:40.489
that's all you need to think.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.667
new initiative, right, Ainsley?

12:52.669 --> 12:54.702
I remember looking
across the dance floor,

12:54.704 --> 12:56.470
seeing that initiative,
and thinking,

12:56.472 --> 12:58.739
"I'm gonna marry
that boy one day."

12:58.741 --> 13:02.443
Right, Bri? We love it...
Where's Brian?

13:02.445 --> 13:03.645
Yesterday, I walked through

13:03.646 --> 13:06.647
several forbidden doors
in my consciousness,

13:06.649 --> 13:09.885
where I discovered realms
of chaos that I must explore.

13:09.886 --> 13:12.819
Yesterday, I counted myself
among the friends.

13:12.821 --> 13:15.221
Today, I am the fox.

13:15.223 --> 13:16.856
<i>The yeas have it.</i>

13:16.858 --> 13:20.460
The Family Leave Act, brought

the number-one source
for brilliant jewels

13:41.882 --> 13:44.449

13:56.329 --> 13:58.062
Isn't he beautiful, folks?

13:58.064 --> 14:00.665
But the real guest of honor
is my dad,

14:00.667 --> 14:03.467
who surprised everyone
and proved that he's capable

14:03.469 --> 14:06.002
of doing a wonderful thing
for working moms...

14:06.004 --> 14:08.572
if it will benefit someone
in his immediate family.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.010
Ted Cruz!

14:14.012 --> 14:16.713
Just like that cute little guy
from "Alien."

14:16.715 --> 14:19.615
Paid family leave
is a fiscal abomination

14:19.617 --> 14:24.286

14:29.093 --> 14:32.895
Well, now that I've sufficiently
made this entire event about moi,

14:32.897 --> 14:37.264

Of course I can take my dad

14:45.942 --> 14:48.743
The Paid Family Leave bill's
given him a whole new image.

14:48.745 --> 14:50.178
It's given you a new image.

14:50.179 --> 14:53.079
A-And as far as your dad goes,
I still can't turn on the TV

14:53.081 --> 14:55.883

for a Deep State military junta.

14:55.885 --> 14:59.052
Um, I think you've been watching
a little bit too much MSNBC.

14:59.054 --> 15:02.086

A-And you know what?

15:02.121 --> 15:03.540

15:03.575 --> 15:05.125

shaking their heads, trying

15:05.127 --> 15:07.127

recognized their own country!

15:07.129 --> 15:10.963
- Well, what am I going to tell him?
- It's called lying, babe. Okay?

15:10.965 --> 15:12.949
You got to get comfortable
with it now, because there's

15:12.950 --> 15:14.934
gonna be a lot of it going

15:15.136 --> 15:18.070
So, here's what I'm thinking
next for us, Ivanka.

15:18.072 --> 15:21.440

anything goes.

15:24.546 --> 15:29.080
Yes! Uh, that sounds so great.
I'd love to do that.

15:29.082 --> 15:31.516
It's just, unfortunately,
I have to go right now.

15:31.518 --> 15:34.753
Well, w-where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?

15:34.755 --> 15:39.925
Oh, um, it's just this dumb party
hosted by... Michael Wolff.

15:39.927 --> 15:42.460

- Fair enough.

Same for you, I guess?

20:30.566 --> 20:33.133
I realized all I knew
was built on a lie,

20:33.135 --> 20:35.068
so I decided to cast aside society

20:35.070 --> 20:37.503
and wander the desert
in search of answers.

20:37.505 --> 20:39.605
If it's solitude you seek,

20:39.607 --> 20:42.775
then follow my serpentine
friendless path,

20:42.777 --> 20:46.346
and you will never be troubled
by social obligations again!

20:46.348 --> 20:49.415
I contemplate the big questions
without worrying

20:49.417 --> 20:52.218
I might be invited out
for a coffee or a drink

20:52.220 --> 20:54.486
or to the funeral
of a dear relative!

20:54.488 --> 20:58.690
And, sure, it's a lonely life,
but on the bright side...

20:58.692 --> 21:00.392
What was I saying again?

21:00.394 --> 21:02.828
I think I should go back
to my friends now.

21:02.830 --> 21:06.832
Your best bet is the Greyhound
station just over the hill there.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.699
Don't tell them who sent ya!

21:08.701 --> 21:11.222
♪ Ah-Ted Cruz,
Ted Cruz, Ted-ed Cruz ♪

21:12.104 --> 21:14.005
That Women for Trump rally
was the tits!

21:14.007 --> 21:17.158
Here's what I'm thinking, Dad.
You, us, tour bus ...

21:17.159 --> 21:18.709
Trump Boys Road Show.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.980
Hit up every Vineyard Vines
location in the country.

21:21.982 --> 21:25.282
I don't know, boys.
Maybe Ivanka was right.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.218
Tour-bus toilets aren't
exactly tweet-friendly.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.287
You miss Ivanka, huh?
You know, Dad,

21:30.289 --> 21:32.890
I learned something all
those weeks ago at SeaWorld.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.026
Orcas don't love being in their
tank, and they really don't like

21:36.028 --> 21:38.461
having soft pretzels
jammed into their blowholes.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.630
But more importantly,
after growing up in captivity,

21:41.632 --> 21:44.267
they can't survive out there
on their own.

21:44.269 --> 21:47.020
Just wait, Dad.
Ivanka will get hungry

21:47.021 --> 21:50.106
for a nice bucket of fish,
and she'll be back.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.043
Filthy bum!
Go back to hell!

21:54.045 --> 21:55.512
Hey! Hey!

21:55.513 --> 22:00.048
Brian Kilmeade?
It's me, IvankaTrump.com.

22:00.050 --> 22:02.667
- What's going on?
- I was trying to get back

22:02.668 --> 22:05.353
to the Fox News building,
but I ran out of money.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.989
Only had enough to get
from Texas to here.

22:07.991 --> 22:10.524
I could desperately use
some bus fare for those

22:10.532 --> 22:14.062
- last nine blocks.
- Yeah... No.

22:14.064 --> 22:16.696
Anyway...
what are you doing here?

22:16.698 --> 22:19.466
I'm tired of being trapped
in my father's orbit,

22:19.468 --> 22:22.336
so I'm going to spin off and
move to Trump Tower, New York,

22:22.338 --> 22:24.071
or maybe Trump Tower, Chicago.

22:24.073 --> 22:28.442
Or go to a different galaxy entirely,
like Trump Tower, Toronto.

22:28.444 --> 22:31.378
Ivanka, I know it's tempting
to forge your own path,

22:31.380 --> 22:33.546
but before long, you will be
holding conversation

22:33.548 --> 22:35.982
with the rotting carcass
of an armadillo

22:35.984 --> 22:38.584
and realize that your path
is a lonely one.

22:38.586 --> 22:42.700
Soon, you'll just want to return
home to those who love you.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.428
Seriously, though, can you loan
me like 80 cents? I'm so close.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.262
<i>♪ Three white people on a couch ♪</i>

22:50.264 --> 22:53.231
<i>♪ It's "Fox & Friends" ♪</i>

22:53.233 --> 22:55.533
It's with a heavy heart
that Ainsley and I announce

22:55.535 --> 22:58.403
that this will be our last
"Fox & Friends."

22:58.405 --> 23:01.706
But don't worry. This won't be
the last time you see us,

23:01.708 --> 23:05.110
assuming you watch
hit Hollywood movies!

23:05.112 --> 23:06.944
That's right. Me and Ainsley

23:06.946 --> 23:09.013
got ourselves
a North Hollywood sublet,

23:09.015 --> 23:10.215
where we'll take
each other's headshot

23:10.216 --> 23:14.251
and try our hand at the
old actor/Uber driver game.

23:14.253 --> 23:18.922
We're really doing it!
# We're going to be famous #

23:18.924 --> 23:21.425
I'm already writing my Oscar speech!

23:21.427 --> 23:24.694
Don't forget to thank your
old friend Brian Kilmeade

23:24.696 --> 23:26.463
- Brian!
- Brian!

23:26.465 --> 23:30.400
Momentarily, sir, we will write
the history of humanity,

23:30.402 --> 23:33.136
because once again,
the Turkish splinter group,

23:33.138 --> 23:35.372
and God bless them,
has gained control

23:35.374 --> 23:39.443
of a completely different fully
operational nuclear missile silo.

23:39.444 --> 23:41.176
SEAL Team Six, who at first

23:41.178 --> 23:44.046
just assumed they'd received
a duplicate e-mail,

23:44.048 --> 23:47.516
is now off the coast,
within striking distance.

23:47.518 --> 23:49.584
- Hello, Daddy!
- God damn it!

23:49.586 --> 23:51.620
I shouldn't have left, Daddy!

23:51.622 --> 23:53.922
I'm sorry I lied to you
about the fashion show.

23:53.924 --> 23:57.158
Baby, I was wrong. I should've
given you your space.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.093
Yes, I wanted some space.

23:59.095 --> 24:01.595
But once I got some, I realized

24:01.597 --> 24:04.298
I will always be a subsidiary
of the Trump organization.

24:04.300 --> 24:08.270
- Sir! We need your permission to launch.
- I love you, sweetie.

24:08.271 --> 24:10.405
Gentlemen, the President
is incapacitated,

24:10.407 --> 24:12.840
and I'll go out on a limb here
and say Vice President Pence

24:12.842 --> 24:16.309
would be okay with us
killing Turkish people.

24:16.311 --> 24:20.013
- It's "kill everyone" time.
- An invitation for the Met Gala?

24:20.015 --> 24:23.550
- But how did you do it?!
- Don't worry about it.

24:23.552 --> 24:28.125
But if anyone asks,
your name is Zac Posen.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.957
Why, thank you, Daddy.
And I got you something, too.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.293
<i>Good morning!</i>

24:33.294 --> 24:36.028
<i>It's a beautiful day
here at "Fox & Friends."</i>

24:36.030 --> 24:39.231
Holy shit!
Brian's back!

24:39.233 --> 24:40.633
I went looking for some truth,

24:40.634 --> 24:43.602
but if there was any truth
out there, I couldn't see it.

24:43.604 --> 24:46.972
You see, I've had no formal
or informal education.

24:46.974 --> 24:50.141
I was found in a barn loft
when I was 32 years old.

24:50.143 --> 24:51.876
Whenever I take off a scarf,

24:51.878 --> 24:54.645
I'm always a little worried
that my head will fall off.

24:54.647 --> 24:58.183
But I learned that sometimes
you have to test your faith

24:58.185 --> 25:00.718
to find out how strong it can be.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.788
Good morning, Mr. President.

25:03.790 --> 25:07.857
I'm so happy to be here.
I love you!

25:07.859 --> 25:10.199
I love you, too, Brian.

25:11.464 --> 25:14.531
Jared! We're going to be late
for the Met Gala!

25:14.533 --> 25:16.467
<i>Oh, no!
Wouldn't want to miss</i>

25:16.469 --> 25:19.336
<i>the chance of getting booed
on the red carpet!</i>

25:22.707 --> 25:24.640
<i>The theme of tonight's Met Gala</i>

25:24.642 --> 25:27.743
<i>is Fashion and
the Catholic Imagination.</i>

25:27.745 --> 25:29.845
<i>And Rihanna is looking stunning</i>

25:29.847 --> 25:34.450
<i>covered in a swarm of live
locusts by Alexander Wang!</i>

25:34.452 --> 25:36.119
Hey!
Wh-What are you doing here?!

25:36.121 --> 25:37.920
You're supposed to be in the TV!

25:37.922 --> 25:40.888
Oh, Daddy, it's great
that you got me in,

25:40.890 --> 25:43.091
but I'd rather spend time with you.

25:43.093 --> 25:45.827
Also, my nanny asked to be paid
while she cared for her sick kid.

25:45.829 --> 25:48.029
What?
So I fired her.

25:48.031 --> 25:52.334
Jesus. What kind of moron expects
to be paid for not working?

25:52.336 --> 25:54.302
I know, right?
It's crazy.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.703
<i>What's the nanny's name?
I'll attack her in the press.</i>

25:56.705 --> 25:59.406
<i>Daddy, you spoil me.
Here. I'll write it down for you.</i>
