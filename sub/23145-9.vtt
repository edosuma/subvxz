WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:05.203
I have a premonition
that all this will end

00:05.272 --> 00:09.007
with Principal Lewis
buying a mattress factory.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.342
Unbelievable premonition.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.811
- Love those omens.
- Go, Billy!

00:13.280 --> 00:15.712
_

00:16.831 --> 00:19.017
Oh, no. It finally happened.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.953
Klaus got the lunch lady job.

00:21.889 --> 00:22.921
Next.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.957
Oh, Steve! It's me, Klaus!

00:25.025 --> 00:26.425
You know, from home?

00:26.493 --> 00:27.960
Oh, God, don't talk to me.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.361
Come here, honey.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.363
I saved you the crustiest
corner of mac and cheese.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.699
It's so hard.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.435
Steve, I know I should know this,

00:36.503 --> 00:38.436
but how are you related to Klaus?

00:38.505 --> 00:39.904
I thought they were a couple!

00:39.906 --> 00:41.906
I don't want to talk
about Klaus anymore.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.007
I can't even eat.

00:44.244 --> 00:45.978
Is someone having Crepes Suzette?

00:46.609 --> 00:48.180
Ugh, the hall monitors.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.248
I hate how they get special treatment.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.450
Come on.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.986
Principal Lewis takes
troubled kids from juvie

00:54.054 --> 00:57.322
and molds them into
productive members of society.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.657
Yeah, they made the cover

00:58.725 --> 01:01.627
of Appropriate Relationships Magazine.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.697
Uh-oh.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.011 --> 01:18.276
Wow.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.213
Look at how fast the
sawdust absorbs the puke.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.748
This is why I became a janitor.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.018
I became a janitor because it was fate.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.619
As you can see...

01:27.688 --> 01:31.156
this birthmark across my body
looks somewhat like a mop.

01:34.708 --> 01:37.247

01:58.394 --> 02:01.253
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

02:02.290 --> 02:03.695
Well, they fired me.

02:03.763 --> 02:06.164
They blamed me for all
those kids getting sick.

02:06.232 --> 02:09.233
It's ridiculous.
I always said "excuse me"

02:09.235 --> 02:11.435
when I farted into the mashed potatoes.

02:11.437 --> 02:14.772
It is a little odd how often
students are throwing up.

02:14.841 --> 02:16.975
That was the third puke-fest this month.

02:17.043 --> 02:18.910
And they always blame a lunch lady.

02:18.979 --> 02:20.979
I was the eighth one fired this year.

02:21.047 --> 02:23.447
Eighth... third.

02:23.449 --> 02:24.916
That's a lot of numbers.

02:24.985 --> 02:27.352
Maybe we should go take a
look around the cafeteria.

02:33.023 --> 02:35.423
Whoa. Sawdust.

02:35.492 --> 02:37.559
Hmm...

02:37.628 --> 02:40.895
Whoa. Sawdust.

02:40.965 --> 02:42.331
Hmm...

02:46.503 --> 02:47.836
That's odd.

02:47.904 --> 02:49.304
No sawdust.

02:49.373 --> 02:51.105
Or is it?

02:51.107 --> 02:52.116
What do you mean?

02:52.176 --> 02:54.309
I don't know.

02:55.732 --> 02:57.712
Just the usual dry, aged beef you'd find

02:57.714 --> 03:00.382
in any public high school cafeteria.

03:00.450 --> 03:01.750
Unless...

03:03.720 --> 03:05.920
- Hmm...
- Hey! Who's in there?

03:06.900 --> 03:08.791
Hank Turlington, school detective.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.058
We need to talk.

03:10.126 --> 03:11.593
And you need to walk.

03:11.662 --> 03:13.796
Me and my partner are
also school detectives,

03:13.864 --> 03:15.930
and we're already on the case.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.066
Maybe we can join...

03:18.134 --> 03:20.068
- forces.
- Maybe.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.203
Is that a yes?

03:21.271 --> 03:23.271
Yes. We have joined forces.

03:23.340 --> 03:24.673
Three man handshake?

03:24.741 --> 03:27.258
Yes. Steve, please join us?

03:27.293 --> 03:28.310
Yes.

03:35.881 --> 03:38.720
Great idea to start mall walking, Stan.

03:38.789 --> 03:40.722
Hey, what's the name of Steve's tailor?

03:40.791 --> 03:42.591
- Petruchio?
- No, his other tailor.

03:42.659 --> 03:44.192
- Carbunkle.
- Yes, that's right.

03:44.261 --> 03:45.327
Hey, Carbunkle!

03:57.274 --> 03:59.541
What's wrong, bud?
Looking a little pale.

03:59.610 --> 04:00.875
Lemme guess, you saw the price

04:00.945 --> 04:02.677
of a pan at Williams Sonoma.

04:02.746 --> 04:04.679
He's coming back out the top!

04:11.155 --> 04:12.754
Hey there, fellas. You mall walking?

04:12.823 --> 04:14.422
I've always wanted to try that out.

04:14.491 --> 04:16.558
Got room for one more?

04:16.627 --> 04:18.091
Guys?

04:18.161 --> 04:19.962
Eh, they're right, Al,
you'd just slow them down.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.764
So smile, you fat clown, and walk away.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.700
Catch ya next time, homies!

04:28.934 --> 04:30.305
Something strange is
going on at this school,

04:30.374 --> 04:32.707
and it all centers
around Principal Lewis

04:32.709 --> 04:33.775
and the hall monitors.

04:33.844 --> 04:35.109
I've been working undercover

04:35.179 --> 04:37.512
as social studies teacher
"Mrs. Womanface."

04:37.581 --> 04:39.514
I'm also the teacher in charge of

04:39.583 --> 04:40.915
the Sadie Hawkins dance.

04:40.985 --> 04:42.450
This year's theme?

04:42.519 --> 04:43.986
"Everyone Must Get Laid."

04:44.054 --> 04:46.521
So, what can I do? I-I want to help.

04:46.523 --> 04:47.722
With the sex dance?

04:47.791 --> 04:48.857
Or the school mystery?

04:48.925 --> 04:50.192
The... second thing.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.861
I need someone undercover
in the hall monitors.

04:52.929 --> 04:54.863
Lewis only recruits bad kids.

04:54.931 --> 04:57.099
So you're about to get sent to juvie.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.271
Help! A student is attacking me!

05:04.268 --> 05:05.674
Wow. You think you know

05:05.742 --> 05:07.075
all the things that turn you on,

05:07.143 --> 05:09.077
but then you see something like this,

05:09.146 --> 05:11.479
and suddenly you're at half-mast.

05:11.548 --> 05:13.148
Aah!

05:13.217 --> 05:14.816
It was this boy right here.

05:14.885 --> 05:17.753
He overpowered me, then he sat down.

05:20.691 --> 05:22.691
AJ Slick,
the head of the hall monitors,

05:22.759 --> 05:24.292
has a brother in juvie, TJ Slick.

05:25.099 --> 05:27.161
I pulled some strings to
make you his cellmate.

05:27.769 --> 05:28.830
That's the easy part.

05:28.899 --> 05:32.367
The hard part's gonna be getting
this monster to trust you.

05:32.436 --> 05:33.568
Trust fall!

05:34.873 --> 05:38.107
You passed my test. Now
we're friends forever.

05:39.043 --> 05:40.775
With TJ's trust earned,

05:40.777 --> 05:42.878
I spent the next month in the yard.

05:46.223 --> 05:47.182
Steve Smith?

05:47.251 --> 05:48.783
You're gettin' out today.

05:48.853 --> 05:50.052
Already?

05:50.120 --> 05:51.920
I've only been slamming my gams.

05:51.988 --> 05:54.056
Didn't even get a
chance to jack my sides

05:54.124 --> 05:56.759
or fran my front or clunk my neck.

05:59.212 --> 06:02.330
- Klaus?
- I fell asleep in your pocket.

06:02.399 --> 06:04.132
I've been in this storage locker

06:04.200 --> 06:07.402
for a month surviving on
leaky AC unit drippings,

06:07.404 --> 06:12.274
rat piss, and, ucch, coconut LaCroix.

06:16.678 --> 06:20.348
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Steve Smith.

06:20.417 --> 06:23.285
Yeah, don't splooge
in your pants or anything.

06:23.353 --> 06:24.553
You wish.

06:24.621 --> 06:28.290
My anti-depressants make
that absolutely impossible.

06:28.358 --> 06:30.158
Told you this guy's a dork.

06:30.226 --> 06:31.493
I thought that, too.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.296
But I heard you were tight
with my big bro in juvie.

06:34.364 --> 06:37.863
I think Steve should be
our new hall monitor.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.634
Yo, I don't know about this guy, AJ.

06:39.636 --> 06:40.835
He seems like a narc.

06:40.837 --> 06:43.505
Oh, yeah? Would a narc do this?

06:43.574 --> 06:45.173
Oh, hey, Steve.

06:45.242 --> 06:46.508
We miss yo... Ooh!

06:46.577 --> 06:47.709
Aah!

06:47.778 --> 06:50.779
Aaah!

06:51.541 --> 06:54.783
Sorry! But I! Have to! Do this!

06:56.171 --> 06:57.920
Cold-blooded, Smith!

06:57.988 --> 06:59.854
Your cruel whispers
that we couldn't hear

06:59.856 --> 07:01.456
really added insult to injury.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.792
Welcome to the hall monitors, Smith.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.127
Here's your hat.

07:05.195 --> 07:06.861
Are the fanny packs part of the uniform?

07:06.863 --> 07:08.863
Nah. They're part of our bodies.

07:08.865 --> 07:10.299
You'll grow one, too.

07:15.576 --> 07:17.271
Steve, forget class.

07:17.341 --> 07:18.806
You're a hall monitor.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.875
Lewis lets us do whatever we want.

07:20.944 --> 07:22.410
You wanna go to my house and watch

07:22.478 --> 07:25.279
"Wall Street:
Money Never Sleeps" on my bed?

07:25.281 --> 07:27.149
Oh, here we go. Hall pass?

07:27.217 --> 07:28.282
Um...

07:28.352 --> 07:29.217
Aah!

07:29.232 --> 07:32.220
You remind me of a dog
turd I once stepped in.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.422
It got into all the grooves of my shoe,

07:34.491 --> 07:37.025
and it took my mom weeks to clean it.

07:37.093 --> 07:38.560
Yeah, Steve! Yeah!

07:38.628 --> 07:40.628
He's hiding something.

07:40.697 --> 07:43.565
Let's see what he's
got in that backpack.

07:45.101 --> 07:46.234
It's everything

07:46.302 --> 07:48.102
we need to make a spaghetti dinner.

07:48.172 --> 07:49.771
Nice haul, Double S.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.639
Any chance you snagged a cabernet?

07:51.708 --> 07:53.641
No, but I got this kid's clarinet.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.643
Clarinet sounds like cabernet.

07:55.712 --> 07:59.113
No, it don't! Clarinet sound like this!

08:09.375 --> 08:10.324
Aah!

08:10.326 --> 08:12.194
Klaus? What are you doing?

08:12.262 --> 08:13.328
What are you doing?

08:13.406 --> 08:15.930
You're supposed to be getting
clues for the school mystery,

08:15.932 --> 08:18.266
not becoming a
Richard-Grieco-type bad boy

08:18.334 --> 08:19.801
who plays by his own rules.

08:19.870 --> 08:22.537
Klaus, I'm fine. I-I'm undercover.

08:22.539 --> 08:23.738
It's all an act.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.540
I hope so. You're supposed to be

08:25.542 --> 08:27.275
getting my lunch lady job back.

08:27.343 --> 08:29.343
And hey, bro, why you peeing

08:29.413 --> 08:31.345
in the stall like a shy guy?

08:31.415 --> 08:33.548
Your dick's super cool.

08:35.684 --> 08:37.018
You guys sure about

08:37.087 --> 08:38.285
this goody-two-shoes?

08:38.354 --> 08:40.422
I don't trust you, Smith.

08:40.490 --> 08:42.690
Maybe you need a little test.

08:42.759 --> 08:43.892
Jerk off in front of these prudes.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.760
- What?
- Yo, we've been over this.

08:45.762 --> 08:48.430
You can't ask kids to jerk
off to prove their loyalty.

08:48.498 --> 08:50.899
Fine. Option two...

08:50.967 --> 08:53.167
go to this pet store
tonight and vandalize it.

08:53.237 --> 08:54.569
Why this pet store?

08:54.638 --> 08:56.871
Because years ago,
I bought a pet gecko there

08:56.940 --> 08:57.972
and it bit me.

08:57.974 --> 09:00.508
It's time to settle the score.

09:06.382 --> 09:08.116
Steve, I don't know about this.

09:08.184 --> 09:09.517
You're breaking into a pet store,

09:09.586 --> 09:11.586
you've driven all your friends away,

09:11.588 --> 09:12.854
and don't think I don't smell

09:12.923 --> 09:14.989
those clove cigarettes on your breath.

09:14.991 --> 09:17.826
- Whatever.
- It's a slippery slope, Steve.

09:17.851 --> 09:18.893
First it's cloves.

09:18.956 --> 09:20.094
Then it's e-cigs.

09:20.171 --> 09:21.596
Then it's regular cigs.

09:21.598 --> 09:22.607
Then it's mary jane.

09:22.666 --> 09:23.675
Then it's cocaine.

09:23.733 --> 09:25.267
Then it's black tar heroin.

09:25.335 --> 09:27.001
That is the order.

09:27.003 --> 09:28.470
You think I like this?

09:28.538 --> 09:30.939
You think I'm enjoying
doing whatever I want

09:31.007 --> 09:34.408
with total impunity,
basically running the school

09:34.478 --> 09:37.479
and being less a student and more a god?

09:37.547 --> 09:40.414
Pray to me!

09:41.137 --> 09:42.350
Sorry, I missed all that.

09:42.418 --> 09:44.018
The lunch ladies and
I just about had our

09:44.087 --> 09:46.755
escape room night planned,
and now Gretchen wants to change

09:46.823 --> 09:49.223
everything around for her son's funeral.

09:49.293 --> 09:51.025
I'm not a bad kid.

09:51.027 --> 09:53.495
I just need to gain Lewis' trust.

09:53.563 --> 09:55.563
I'll only release one animal.

09:55.632 --> 09:58.232
No harm, no foul, no big whoop.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.436
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:01.505 --> 10:02.514
No, no, no, no!

10:02.572 --> 10:04.105
Not the snakes!

10:04.174 --> 10:05.183
No!

10:05.241 --> 10:06.574
Oh!

10:06.643 --> 10:08.510
Not the pretty peacocks!

10:13.383 --> 10:14.950
I'm sure they'll come back.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.987
How do these stupid birds

10:19.055 --> 10:20.388
keep getting in our house?

10:21.303 --> 10:25.860
Oh, ladies, ladies,
this dancing has exhausted me.

10:25.862 --> 10:28.963
Let us step inside
for some refreshments.

10:29.039 --> 10:31.333
Myah! Myah!

10:31.401 --> 10:32.534
That laugh.

10:32.602 --> 10:34.268
It's enchanting!

10:35.939 --> 10:38.540
Hey, it's that wonderful
working-class Brit

10:38.608 --> 10:40.542
who owns the sunglass place at the mall.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.344
I found yer 'usband

10:42.412 --> 10:44.090
and this grey boy at the mall.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.747
Why are they frozen like this?

10:45.816 --> 10:48.750
These geezas saw sum'ing terrible.

10:48.818 --> 10:52.086
Sum'ing that made them lose their words.

10:52.088 --> 10:57.425
Sum'ing that even $4,000
of sunglasses couldn't fix.

10:57.494 --> 10:59.161
I charged it to a credit card

10:59.229 --> 11:02.564
I found stickin' out the grey one's ass.

11:02.632 --> 11:04.232
Anyway, I gotta get back.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.603
I'm expectin' a
'uge shipment of Oakley's.

11:09.573 --> 11:12.506
- What did he say?
- I think it was a poem.

11:12.508 --> 11:14.642
It was so beautiful.

11:14.711 --> 11:16.378
'Sup with them?

11:19.786 --> 11:22.517
Today's chicken provencal was amazing.

11:22.586 --> 11:26.921
Really made up for yesterday's
pitiful trout almondine.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.723
You should smile more.

11:28.725 --> 11:30.859
Steven. I need to see you.

11:30.927 --> 11:31.793
Now.

11:31.862 --> 11:33.528
I'm worried about you, Steve.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.463
- I have half a mind to pull you out.
- You can't...

11:35.532 --> 11:36.798
Don't listen to Steve!

11:36.867 --> 11:39.201
He's been seduced by the
hall monitor lifestyle.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.869
I have not.

11:40.937 --> 11:42.404
Then you won't have a problem...

11:42.472 --> 11:43.538
wearing a wire.

11:43.607 --> 11:45.874
Ooh, tonight's bad for a wire.

11:45.942 --> 11:47.609
We have a big dinner with Lewis.

11:47.677 --> 11:49.744
L-Let's pencil it in
for after Labor Day.

11:49.813 --> 11:53.748
That would give me a chance
to focus on the sex dance.

11:53.750 --> 11:54.883
Steve doesn't want to catch Lewis

11:54.951 --> 11:56.751
because he's in too deep.

11:56.753 --> 11:58.286
Right. Steve wears the wire.

11:58.354 --> 11:59.421
Tonight.

11:59.489 --> 12:01.380
- Fine.
- I'm coming with.

12:01.458 --> 12:04.158
And if we get in trouble,
I have cyanide pills.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.628
We cannot fall into enemy hands.

12:06.696 --> 12:08.963
Wait, they look just like my Tic Tacs.

12:08.965 --> 12:10.765
Why did I mix them together?

12:10.767 --> 12:15.503
Oh, man, I was handing these out
like crazy at the post office.

12:19.576 --> 12:22.043
Damn, guys. Smith cracks me up!

12:22.112 --> 12:24.178
They're on to us.
We got no way out.

12:24.248 --> 12:25.713
Take the pill.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.715
As you know, I gathered you here

12:27.784 --> 12:29.851
to reveal my diabolical scheme.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.385
That sounds like dessert talk.

12:31.387 --> 12:32.921
It all started when I was wasted

12:32.989 --> 12:34.522
and bought a Christmas tree farm.

12:34.591 --> 12:37.259
But that thing makes no
money 11 months a year!

12:37.327 --> 12:40.194
I had to find a way to
make money year round,

12:40.196 --> 12:43.798
so I cooked up this
totally illegal idea.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.267
Hold that thought, I gotta take a dump.

12:45.335 --> 12:47.401
Hold that dump, I gotta share a thought.

12:47.403 --> 12:49.604
I've been grinding up
the trees for sawdust,

12:49.606 --> 12:50.939
but nobody wanted this stuff.

12:51.101 --> 12:53.808
So I finally had the excuse

12:53.877 --> 12:56.544
to do something I've
wanted to do for years...

12:56.613 --> 12:58.146
poison children.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.682
Lots of vomit means lots of sawdust.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.085
I-I don't think any of
that could be tied to you.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.019
But that was small potatoes.

13:05.021 --> 13:06.888
This next part is big potatoes.

13:06.957 --> 13:08.090
If someone were to record it,

13:08.158 --> 13:09.757
there's not a jury in the world

13:09.826 --> 13:12.160
that wouldn't lock me up
and throw away the key!

13:12.228 --> 13:15.630
I'm going to poison the
town's water supply!

13:15.632 --> 13:19.301
Me! Principal Brian Lewis!

13:19.369 --> 13:20.702
Oh, boy.

13:20.771 --> 13:23.104
Oh, man. What a sting.

13:23.173 --> 13:25.173
We got Lewis dead to rights.

13:25.241 --> 13:26.908
Didn't you think some
of the things he said

13:26.977 --> 13:29.444
had a jokey, inadmissible quality?

13:29.513 --> 13:31.846
Oh, no. This is airtight.

13:31.848 --> 13:33.047
Whoo-hoo!

13:33.049 --> 13:34.750
I'm gonna hit the sack.

13:38.655 --> 13:39.787
I can't sleep.

13:39.856 --> 13:41.189
I'm buzzing.

13:41.257 --> 13:43.658
Where are those cyanide pills?

13:43.660 --> 13:44.793
I'll just take a little half.

13:44.861 --> 13:47.529
Slow down the old super-computer.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.063
What are you doing?!

13:49.065 --> 13:50.074
I-I have to do it!

13:50.134 --> 13:51.933
I have to! I'm in too deep!

13:52.002 --> 13:54.802
Before you do it,
just let me say three words to you...

13:54.871 --> 13:56.738
telescoping driving cane.

13:56.807 --> 13:58.540
That means nothing to me.

13:59.237 --> 14:00.608
Hi-yaaaa!

14:02.679 --> 14:04.679
He's coming to!

14:04.748 --> 14:06.614
Wh-What's going on?

14:06.683 --> 14:08.883
These are the women Lewis fired.

14:08.952 --> 14:12.220
They wander the streets,
still dressed as lunch ladies.

14:12.288 --> 14:14.822
They just want to put slop on plates.

14:14.891 --> 14:17.492
- Won't you help them, Steve?
- I will.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.162
Your whack on the head
knocked some sense into me.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.430
We've got to get this
evidence to Turlington.

14:23.284 --> 14:25.033
I'll drive.

14:25.101 --> 14:27.569
Where does one buy a
telescoping driving cane?

14:27.637 --> 14:28.903
- Eddie Bauer.
- Oh.

14:33.258 --> 14:34.843
Do you think it was suicide?

14:34.911 --> 14:36.444
At least we have the recording.

14:36.513 --> 14:38.046
We can still take it to the cops.

14:38.114 --> 14:41.183
We should close his eyes.

14:41.251 --> 14:42.316
Oh, shit.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.853
This freak doesn't have any eyelids.

14:45.616 --> 14:46.755
Gather round.

14:46.768 --> 14:48.990
All you cops are gonna
want to hear this.

14:49.059 --> 14:51.259
Yeah, so put down
your doughnuts, piggies,

14:51.327 --> 14:52.360
and listen up!

14:58.268 --> 14:59.934
It's so dang hot under this.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.335
I'm dying.

15:01.337 --> 15:04.539
Why did I guzzle that Arizona Iced Tea?

15:06.009 --> 15:09.544
Steve's wearing a jacket
and a long-sleeve tee?

15:09.613 --> 15:11.079
What is wrong with him?

15:12.350 --> 15:14.082
Well, we have nothing.

15:14.150 --> 15:15.617
Wait, don't turn it off.

15:15.685 --> 15:18.086
I'm about to sing a song from "Wicked."

15:18.154 --> 15:20.021
The wizard is ready for you.

15:27.631 --> 15:29.631
Turlington's dead,
the whole town's about

15:29.699 --> 15:30.765
to get poisoned...

15:31.686 --> 15:34.969
And now Lewis wants to take
me up to the tree farm.

15:34.971 --> 15:36.704
Oh, God! He's gonna kill me!

15:36.773 --> 15:38.973
No. He's gonna kill us.

15:38.975 --> 15:40.374
You're not coming.

15:40.376 --> 15:43.377
It's sweet of you to worry about me,
but I'm coming.

15:43.379 --> 15:45.046
Fine. But to be clear,

15:45.115 --> 15:46.514
I wasn't trying to keep you safe.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.450
I just didn't want to be around you.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.452
Your little bowl bothers me.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.320
All the scooting and scraping.

15:52.388 --> 15:54.656
It's... very unpleasant.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.796
_

15:58.528 --> 16:00.262
I thought it was about time you all saw

16:00.330 --> 16:01.463
where the magic happens.

16:01.531 --> 16:03.131
I call it magic because I don't know

16:03.199 --> 16:05.133
what any of these machines do.

16:05.201 --> 16:09.203
I have a bunch of fat guys who
make the machines eat the trees.

16:09.205 --> 16:10.672
They're so fat.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.140
You should see their work pants.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.276
The size! When they hang them up to dry,

16:14.344 --> 16:16.278
they look like medieval tapestries!

16:16.346 --> 16:18.814
Some of them are truly gorgeous.

16:19.816 --> 16:22.484
I'm gonna sneak off and do some recon.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.486
Klaus, it's super-dangerous.

16:24.554 --> 16:28.290
Don't worry.
Ol' Klaus can take care of himself.

16:46.376 --> 16:47.709
This isn't funny anymore.

16:47.778 --> 16:50.712
We gotta do something about
these Catatonic Cathys.

16:50.781 --> 16:52.381
It's been days.

16:53.383 --> 16:54.516
Okay, that was a little funny.

16:55.335 --> 16:57.452
Don't worry, Mom. I called in some help.

16:57.521 --> 16:59.654
Dr. Ray?

16:59.723 --> 17:01.323
I-I thought you died.

17:01.391 --> 17:03.257
- No.
- Oh, okay.

17:03.259 --> 17:05.327
Let's see what we've got here.

17:05.395 --> 17:06.404
Mm-hmm.

17:06.462 --> 17:07.929
With extreme cases like this,

17:07.998 --> 17:11.598
I find that returning to the
scene of the initial event

17:11.667 --> 17:15.002
sometimes helps snap
the patient out of it.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.672
How long could this take?

17:17.674 --> 17:19.674
I don't know. I gave up 30 minutes ago.

17:19.742 --> 17:21.474
Ooh! A Cinnabon!

18:03.453 --> 18:05.587
They're gonna be vegetables forever!

18:13.864 --> 18:15.129
Oh, hey, fun.

18:15.199 --> 18:16.931
The whole family's mall walking.

18:16.933 --> 18:20.068
What do you think?
Could old Al use a few laps?

18:21.405 --> 18:23.471
Do you even hear yourself?
"Oh, hey, fun.

18:23.540 --> 18:24.606
"The whole family's mall walking.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.608
Yeah." Oh, you're the town fool.

18:26.676 --> 18:28.676
Just get of here with your dignity.

18:28.745 --> 18:30.945
Smell ya on the flip side, skater bois.

18:30.947 --> 18:33.147
What the hell was that?

18:35.219 --> 18:37.151
Huh? Huh?

18:37.153 --> 18:39.221
Ha. Those are funny.

18:39.289 --> 18:40.889
They're not supposed to be funny.

18:40.957 --> 18:42.757
I think they're incredibly moving.

18:42.759 --> 18:46.828
And now for the main event...
making the whole town puke.

18:46.897 --> 18:49.431
With this gross stuff
I found in my trunk.

18:50.593 --> 18:51.499
Ugh!

18:51.568 --> 18:55.570
This pipe leads directly
to the town's water supply.

18:56.476 --> 18:57.906
You think that's bad?

18:57.974 --> 18:59.641
Get ready to gasp again.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.910
There's a mole among our ranks.

19:04.248 --> 19:05.980
This is Turlington's phone,

19:06.049 --> 19:10.518
and this is the contact labeled
"hall monitor spy."

19:13.523 --> 19:15.189
We could have made a great team, Smith.

19:15.259 --> 19:17.992
But instead, you chose to be
murdered by your classmates.

19:18.061 --> 19:19.261
Get him!

19:20.931 --> 19:22.931
You almost thought
of everything, Lewis.

19:22.999 --> 19:26.334
But there's one thing you
forgot to have thought of...

19:26.402 --> 19:30.204
In juvie, I only worked out my legs!

19:34.945 --> 19:36.047
Ooh!

19:39.549 --> 19:41.549
Lewis, you've poisoned
your last person...

19:43.920 --> 19:44.953
...me.

19:46.022 --> 19:48.222
Hold it right there!

19:48.292 --> 19:50.358
Hey! I thought we flushed you!

19:50.426 --> 19:54.296
When you flush,
you've gotta check the bowl.

19:54.364 --> 19:56.765
Lunch ladies, attack!

19:57.968 --> 20:00.168
Oh!

20:05.075 --> 20:06.110
Ooh!

20:11.247 --> 20:13.047
Aah!

20:13.687 --> 20:15.384
Aaah!

20:16.987 --> 20:19.453
Aaah!

20:23.527 --> 20:25.760
Wh-Wh-What happened?

20:25.762 --> 20:26.795
Easy, bud.

20:26.863 --> 20:29.463
You're home safe in
the school cafeteria.

20:29.465 --> 20:31.265
Wh-What's going in my arm?

20:31.267 --> 20:32.800
You lost a lot of fluids,

20:32.869 --> 20:35.403
so Agnes put you on a Salisbury IV.

20:35.472 --> 20:38.606
Look, the brown's returning
to your cheeks already.

20:38.675 --> 20:42.276
Thanks for saving me from Lewis,
and from myself.

20:42.346 --> 20:44.078
Hey, what happened to Lewis?

20:44.148 --> 20:45.613
He got away basically.

20:45.682 --> 20:47.749
Lewis gets away again!

20:47.818 --> 20:50.218
Hey, you wanna buy a mattress factory?

20:50.286 --> 20:53.155
[BLEEP] yeah, I do!

20:54.791 --> 20:58.893
