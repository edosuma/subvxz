WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:10.044
Do you have any idea
how much water it takes

00:10.144 --> 00:11.479
to grow one almond?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.013
Why would I possibly
know that?

00:13.114 --> 00:15.583
I'm just saying if you really
cared about the environment,

00:15.683 --> 00:17.085
you would switch to oat milk.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.986
Says the girl who insists
on driving everywhere,

00:19.087 --> 00:21.389
even if she's only
going two blocks.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.891
I have plantar fasciitis.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.460
ESME:
Yeah, and last week
you had valley fever.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.097
Whatswrongwithme.com
is not your friend.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.999
Um, are you seeing this?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.202
Oh, this is so going viral.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.836
(panting)

00:38.339 --> 00:39.707
Uh...

00:40.441 --> 00:42.743
What are you
doing? (gasps)

00:42.843 --> 00:43.944
Are you okay?

00:44.044 --> 00:47.115
No, I was just assaulted!
(honks)

00:47.215 --> 00:48.182
Oh, my God!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.950
(people exclaiming)

00:50.951 --> 00:55.323
Well, don't just stand
there, call 911!

00:55.423 --> 00:57.658
* *

01:25.786 --> 01:29.523
(chuckles) No. It is an
all-girls weekend.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.791
All right,
all I'm saying is that

01:30.891 --> 01:32.360
I bring a lot to the table,
all right?

01:32.460 --> 01:35.429
Morning, McGee.
Morning.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.966
Earth to McGee.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.201
(hits key)

01:40.301 --> 01:42.236
Sorry, I was in the zone there.
Morning.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.472
I will never understand
how you find

01:44.572 --> 01:46.640
after action reports so...

01:46.740 --> 01:48.442
Gripping and fascinating.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.643
Mm-hmm.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.379
Well, I do love
a good AAR,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.647
but, uh, no, this is
more of a personal project.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.983
You gonna make us ask?

01:57.885 --> 01:59.720
Thom E. Gemcity is back, baby.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.521
(gasps)

02:00.621 --> 02:03.257
(gasp) Yes!

02:03.357 --> 02:05.058
Cool.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.894
Oh, Knight...

02:09.263 --> 02:10.831
Thom E. Gemcity?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.334
That's his pen name.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.603
Yeah. Anagram of Timothy McGee.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.839
McGee. You're a novelist?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.741
Yeah.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.377
So the John Grisham
of NCIS has been sitting

02:23.477 --> 02:25.513
six feet away from me
for two years now,

02:25.613 --> 02:26.680
and I had no idea?

02:26.780 --> 02:27.915
Well, I like to think
of myself

02:28.015 --> 02:29.750
more as a Tom Clancy type,
but yeah.

02:29.850 --> 02:34.655
Okay, so what mystery
is Special Agent, uh, Tibbs

02:34.755 --> 02:36.056
embarking on next?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.558
Are you guys messing with me?

02:37.658 --> 02:38.959
Why would you say that?

02:39.059 --> 02:43.063
Your lead character's name
is Special Agent Tibbs?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.832
Yeah.
Because

02:44.932 --> 02:47.668
"Gibbs" couldn't clear legal?
(chuckles)

02:47.768 --> 02:50.638
Oh, no, Gibbs and Tibbs
are wildly different people.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.506
Okay, man, so what?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.974
Spit it out.
What's the story?

02:54.074 --> 02:55.976
Well, since, uh, Gibbs
is off doing his thing,

02:56.076 --> 02:58.812
I figured that L.J. Tibbs
deserves a little R and R.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.048
You're just gonna have to
wait and see what comes next.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.651
Fine, I'll wait.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.119
I do have a new
character idea for you.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.421
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.557
He's a badass Miami detective

03:09.657 --> 03:12.726
by the name of Rick Soares.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.529
Ooh, I wonder
who that could be.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.831
Oh, uh,
Detective Rick Soares is

03:17.931 --> 03:19.233
only inspired by me,
but I do have

03:19.333 --> 03:20.834
some cool ideas I think
you're gonna love.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.670
Mm.
(phones chiming)

03:24.705 --> 03:26.774
Dead body in Alexandria.
Parker will meet us there.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.442
All right, duty calls.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.678
Well, I guess you'll have to
save those stories for later.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.946
Oh, it's all good.
I'll just tell you on the way.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.618
All right, so,
we first meet Soares

03:37.718 --> 03:40.053
in a seedy downtown bar, okay?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.055
Now, he's undercover.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.992
And then, like, just randomly,
this mysterious woman

03:45.092 --> 03:49.129
rolls up and just starts
making out with him.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.670
So then Detective Soares
wakes up in a brothel

03:56.770 --> 03:58.406
in the middle
of the Nevada desert

03:58.506 --> 04:01.875
with, like, multiple
guns in his face. Right?
Mm-hmm.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.143
It's cool so far, right?
Yeah, yeah.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.513
It's good, right?
Yeah, no, very cool.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.047
So, then, we think he's dead,
Here you go.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.418
all right, but then
he, like, kinda like,

04:10.518 --> 04:11.852
"I recognize, like, that guy

04:11.952 --> 04:14.054
from the sting
at the-at the riverboat."
Mm.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.490
Hey, McGee, did I hear
that you're writing again?

04:16.590 --> 04:17.858
I mean, it's been a while, huh?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.793
Well, now that we're
past the toddler phase,

04:19.893 --> 04:22.863
Delilah and I have decided
that we're gonna do, uh,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.832
well, whatever it is
we were, uh, doing

04:24.932 --> 04:26.166
before we had small children.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.368
That is so great to hear.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.602
I know you're always happiest

04:28.702 --> 04:29.537
when you're in front
of a typewriter.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.771
Better not be any

04:30.871 --> 04:32.272
thinly-veiled versions of me

04:32.373 --> 04:34.174
in your new book, McGee.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.509
Ooh, I would never.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.978
Well, maybe Thom E. Gemcity's
next case can be

04:38.078 --> 04:41.549
based on our
nearly naked victim here.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.050
Oh, yeah, okay, Jimmy.
(chuckles)

04:43.150 --> 04:45.252
Tim's got plenty
of great ideas coming his way,

04:45.353 --> 04:46.854
so, uh, what do we got?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.221
PARKER:
According to the CAC

04:48.322 --> 04:49.890
he was carrying, his
name is William Watson.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.660
He was supposed to participate
in NROTC drills

04:52.760 --> 04:54.227
at the base this morning,

04:54.328 --> 04:56.830
but multiple cell phone videos
show him stripping off

04:56.930 --> 04:59.567
all of his clothes and running
into the street instead.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.835
No offense, Jimmy, but
doesn't sound like

05:01.935 --> 05:03.203
a very compelling story.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.706
Well, you haven't even heard
the mystery yet.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.609
This guy's body temperature
was 107 degrees.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.478
He was suffering from
heatstroke.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.812
In the middle of winter?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.614
Therein lies the mystery.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.282
Well, maybe he was
trying to jump

05:15.383 --> 05:16.850
into that fountain over there.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.552
Any idea why the spike
in temperature?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.154
Yeah.
Drugs, poison, hot yoga.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.190
We'll know more when
we get him back to autopsy.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.125
This is everything
that he had on,

05:25.225 --> 05:27.895
plus wallet and keys.
Where's his phone?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.897
Either somebody stole it
or he wasn't carrying one.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.534
But I did find this receipt
in his wallet.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.503
Café in Alexandria
couple hours ago.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.637
Paid cash.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.838
Hey, who wants
to go check it out?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.473
Uh, I could use
a caffeine boost.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.608
I'll go check it out.
Are those

05:40.708 --> 05:41.909
Watson's?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.944
Uh, unless somebody else
left their shoes

05:44.044 --> 05:45.178
in the middle of the sidewalk.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.648
Ooh.
Uh, why?

05:47.748 --> 05:49.683
Because these are LV Trainers

05:49.783 --> 05:51.685
that happen to be in
my dream colorway.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.253
Those are nice, man.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.655
Right?
Yeah.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.924
McGee, are you a novelist
and a sneaker head?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.426
Oh, yeah, but, uh,
Delilah would kill me

05:58.526 --> 06:01.094
if I paid $1,500
for a pair of shoes.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.530
Yeah.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.064
You know, if only
we had another way

06:04.164 --> 06:06.099
to expand on that
shoe collection.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.835
McGEE:
You know, sometimes,
when the case

06:07.935 --> 06:09.870
is done, the victim's families
don't always pick up

06:09.970 --> 06:11.004
their personal belongings.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.006
That's all I'm saying.
Just saying.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.976
Here's an idea. Let's spend
less time shoe shopping

06:16.076 --> 06:18.211
and more on the crime
right in front of us.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.346
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.314
I will take those.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.017
And I'll see if I can
find our victim's phone.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719
And I'll see if I can find out

06:25.819 --> 06:26.820
what he was doing at the café.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.055
Let's not bury the lede here.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.491
We need to find out
how a midshipman

06:30.591 --> 06:32.793
can afford $1,500 shoes.

06:34.261 --> 06:37.665
KNIGHT:
So I ran Watson's financials,
or lack thereof,

06:37.765 --> 06:39.199
and there is no credit history,

06:39.299 --> 06:40.501
no savings and no checking
accounts.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.870
And yet his shoes cost more than

06:42.970 --> 06:44.104
most people make in a week.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.906
And no traditional
phone plan either.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.042
Uh, the wireless company said
he had a pay-as-you-go account.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.912
Uses burner phones, pays cash.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.015
So, multiple witnesses
at the café report

06:55.115 --> 06:58.385
seeing Watson hanging around
the back alley

06:58.486 --> 07:00.954
early this morning.
Could have been dealing.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.223
Café have any cameras?
Well, none that work.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.825
But I was able to score
some security footage

07:04.925 --> 07:07.160
from a business
across the alley.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.366
Well, there's our victim.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.436
Back alley is a good place
for a drug deal.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.276
McGee.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.480
Isn't that your wife?

07:26.580 --> 07:30.350
Tim, what is Delilah doing
meeting with our victim?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.255
That's a good question.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.097
(line ringing)
(sighs) She's not answering.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.834
My wife just met with a drug
dealer, and she's not answering.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.803
Possible drug dealer.

07:49.903 --> 07:50.938
(phone vibrates)

07:52.005 --> 07:53.140
Oh, thank God, it's Delilah.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.407
She's okay?

07:54.508 --> 07:56.544
Yeah. I don't know why
I-I panicked.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.345
Well, maybe because
she just met with

07:58.445 --> 07:59.580
a possible drug dealer.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.314
No, I forgot she had class.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.684
Back alley meeting class?

08:03.784 --> 08:07.154
Fundamentals in Cryptography.
She's teaching.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.622
Since when?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.124
Well, since the, uh, twins
started school.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.726
Something she always
wanted to do

08:12.826 --> 08:14.294
and she was offered
a part-time professorship

08:14.394 --> 08:15.529
at Waverly, so...

08:15.629 --> 08:17.765
Waverly University?

08:17.865 --> 08:18.899
Yeah.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.403
Our victim went to that school.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.639
He must have been
one of her students.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.107
A student she never mentioned?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.743
Well, Delilah tells me
about all her students,

08:29.843 --> 08:30.844
just not by name.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.813
Pull up the roster.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.816
There he is.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.517
Why would she and
a student sneak into

08:37.618 --> 08:41.088
an off-campus café
through the back door?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.522
Delilah doesn't sneak anywhere.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.391
That café isn't
wheelchair-accessible,

08:44.491 --> 08:46.894
so she would have had to
go through the kitchen.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.461
The kitchen?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.431
Yeah. Sucks, but we run into
that type of thing all the time.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.166
That's not cool.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.367
Yeah, whose heads
are we busting?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.869
Busting heads sounds
about right.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.505
Or I've got a friend at
DoJ's civil rights division.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.173
He can help file a complaint.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.374
Oh, give me that number.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.810
After we solve the case.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.112
Whether she's involved or not,
Delilah may be

09:05.212 --> 09:06.880
our best lead on
this right now.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.216
Torres, Knight, keep digging
into our victim.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.151
McGee, with me.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.552
Where to?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.356
To find out
what your wife knows.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.561
DELILAH:
So, to review,

09:21.662 --> 09:23.864
Alice and Bob
first need to decide

09:23.964 --> 09:25.733
on a prime modulus
and a generator,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.534
where P is prime

09:27.635 --> 09:29.803
and G is a primitive root mod P.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.005
You have any idea
what she's talking about?

09:32.105 --> 09:34.808
Not a clue, but
they're eating it up.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.680
She's good, isn't she?
Unless she has one
of their secret integers.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.549
And that is Diffie-Hellman
in a nutshell.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.351
We'll leave it there for today.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.658
Tim, what's going on?
Are the kids okay?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.192
Kids are fine.
Kids are fine.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.561
Then why are you showing up
at my work unannounced

09:54.662 --> 09:55.729
with that look on your face?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.530
You must be Delilah's husband.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.432
Uh, you must be Evelyn.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.567
I am.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.002
You a student here?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.071
Well, I consider myself
a lifelong learner.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.372
But I am
actually

10:05.472 --> 10:07.207
Delilah's T.A.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.308
I cannot believe

10:08.408 --> 10:09.609
that I am finally meeting

10:09.710 --> 10:12.479
the famous Agent Tim McGee
in person.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.247
A federal agent and

10:14.347 --> 10:15.448
a best-selling author?

10:15.548 --> 10:18.185
I can see why
Delilah married you.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.654
Uh, I'm the one
that married up.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.923
No disagreement there.
But, uh,

10:23.023 --> 10:24.557
this isn't a social visit,
Evelyn.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.593
We, uh, we need to have a word
with Delilah.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.228
Evelyn, how about
we start

10:28.328 --> 10:29.863
grading last week's
assignment

10:29.963 --> 10:31.498
on AES?
It'll be just a minute.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.166
Consider it done.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.803
Again, so lovely to meet you.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.606
So, what's going on?

10:39.707 --> 10:42.342
We're here about William Watson.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.811
Oh, he's not here.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.814
He had some NROTC
training today.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.883
He was hit by a car
this morning.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.185
What? Is he okay?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.922
Afraid not.
He didn't make it.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.858
What? Oh, my God.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.427
(sighs)
He had so much potential.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.296
He was one of my
brightest students.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.165
He reminded me of you, actually.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.633
I'm sorry, honey.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.136
You met with Watson
this morning?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.204
We met every week.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.407
So this was ongoing?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.843
No, it's-it's fine.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.411
She can be with a student
without it being a thing.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.713
Thank you, Tim.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.682
So why, exactly,
were you meeting?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.652
To discuss his
research project

11:25.753 --> 11:29.656
on modern cryptologic uses
for dead languages.

11:29.757 --> 11:30.958
Did you notice anything

11:31.058 --> 11:32.726
out of the ordinary
this morning?

11:32.826 --> 11:36.463
Why? I thought you said
he was hit by a car.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.299
After he, uh,
stripped off his clothes

11:39.399 --> 11:41.568
and ran into the street.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.375
Vanilla latte, extra hot.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.377
I love that you know
my coffee order.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.145
I love that you are
secure enough

11:52.245 --> 11:53.981
to unashamedly drink
vanilla lattes.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.016
Life's too short
for bad coffee.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.486
Mm. Cheers to that.
Give me the good stuff.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.854
Well, speaking
of the good stuff, uh,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.756
Kasie just sent down
Watson's tox report.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.892
Anything interesting?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.526
Only if you count
incredibly high levels of

12:06.626 --> 12:08.461
methylenedioxymethamphetamines,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.030
more commonly known as...

12:10.130 --> 12:11.765
MDMA.
Mm-hmm.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.133
Ecstasy.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.168
But even levels that high
wouldn't kill him.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.039
Not that I'm speaking
from personal experience,

12:19.139 --> 12:21.341
because I wouldn't want you
to think that I've dabbled,

12:21.441 --> 12:24.244
because I wouldn't assume
that you've dabbled.
Oh, no.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.146
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.314
Um, yes, I have.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.316
Um, it was a clinical trial

12:29.416 --> 12:30.750
for science.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.620
Closely monitored by
medical professionals.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.523
I was broke and
it really paid well.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.325
We should come back to that.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.960
Yeah, I think so.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.162
Watson's very high
body temperature

12:42.262 --> 12:43.463
was not caused by MDMA.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.665
It was caused
by serotonin syndrome.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.868
It's an incredibly rare
complication when

12:47.968 --> 12:51.204
MDMA interacts with
MAOI antidepressants.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.074
So you're saying this was just

12:54.174 --> 12:55.408
an unfortunate accident?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
I don't know.
I-I don't know of anyone

12:57.110 --> 12:59.446
who takes this amount of MDMA
at 8:00 in the morning

12:59.546 --> 13:00.713
unless they're
Hunter S. Thompson,

13:00.814 --> 13:02.682
and I did not see
gonzo journalism

13:02.782 --> 13:04.885
on this kid's class list.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.519
His school records did say that

13:06.619 --> 13:08.255
he was, uh,
pledging a fraternity.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.524
Maybe hazing gone wrong?

13:11.624 --> 13:15.028
* I'm an all star
in every sport *

13:15.128 --> 13:16.864
* Bases loaded, we running *

13:16.964 --> 13:18.832
* Full court,
it's a touchdown... *

13:18.932 --> 13:21.234
Hi, we're...
Yo, someone's parents are here.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.370
* With rings
but I need more... *

13:23.470 --> 13:24.771
Ouch.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.739
Do I have crow's feet
or something?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.275
No, you look beautiful.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.642
So do you.
Thank you.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.211
* It's a touchdown *

13:31.311 --> 13:33.446
* You better press record,
I'm a champion... *

13:33.546 --> 13:35.582
We're no one's parents.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.850
NCIS.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.618
We're not the alcohol police

13:38.718 --> 13:41.088
but we are gonna
need to see some IDs.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.859
We're here about
Will Watson.
Will?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.694
Hasn't been here all day.

13:47.794 --> 13:48.761
And you are?

13:48.862 --> 13:51.231
Logan. Will's roommate.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.600
You find Will, let him know
Mike's looking for him, too.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.268
Why are you looking for him?

13:55.368 --> 13:58.171
Since he went MIA I had to
do my own laundry this morning.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.107
This was my
favorite shirt.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.142
You're supposed to use
non-chlorine bleach

14:02.242 --> 14:03.376
when washing colors.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.612
And you'll speak
when spoken to, pledge.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.515
Soon as Will walks through
those doors I'm gonna kill him.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.885
Well, you're gonna
be waiting a while.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.090
(sighs) I can't
believe Will's dead.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.292
He was such
a good guy.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.996
A little stiff, but cool.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.165
Did the active brothers
subject you

14:25.265 --> 14:27.734
to any kind of hazing?
Not really.

14:27.834 --> 14:31.038
Just normal stuff
like writing their papers,

14:31.138 --> 14:33.740
running errands, doing laundry.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.343
That doesn't feel like
hazing to you?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.211
Well, the beer's free.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.813
But that's the only drug
we do here.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.883
What about Will?
Did he take anything?

14:43.984 --> 14:46.987
You obviously never met Will.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.189
He was too straightlaced
for that.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.125
The straightlaced are always
the ones hiding something.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.761
(chimes)

14:54.861 --> 14:56.396
that's probably
the dean's list announcement.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.366
We were gonna celebrate
after we made it.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.402
The guys in this house
don't strike me

15:02.502 --> 15:03.736
as the honor roll type.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.538
Most of them aren't.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.140
But Will was different.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.841
He knew there were
more important things

15:08.942 --> 15:10.310
to being a
Delta Pi Beta.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.713
Though none of that
seems important right now.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.020
Hmm. What do we have here?

15:22.822 --> 15:24.491
I've never seen that before.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.693
Well, let's see what's on it.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.029
Do I really want to know
what a college freshman

15:29.129 --> 15:31.364
is hiding on a computer
underneath his bed?

15:31.464 --> 15:34.001
Get your mind out
of the gutter, Knight.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.007
I have no idea what this is,

15:40.107 --> 15:42.675
but it is the last thing
I expected.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.411
Oh, you don't read C++?

15:44.511 --> 15:45.645
Uh, we're not nerds.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.913
Oh...

15:47.014 --> 15:48.081
And I mean that in the most
(chuckles)

15:48.181 --> 15:50.650
loving way possible.
But what is it?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.585
Wait a minute.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.756
This is a root-based algorithm
belonging to the U.S. military.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.492
And ROTC midshipmen
don't have access

15:59.592 --> 16:00.527
to classified intel.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.894
So, how did Watson get it?

16:01.995 --> 16:04.464
And why was he hiding it
under his mattress?

16:04.564 --> 16:05.732
(typing)

16:06.533 --> 16:08.701
This could be why.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.770
Restricted
coding libraries

16:10.870 --> 16:12.705
for several government agencies.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.543
DIA, CIA, NSA?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.111
Well, that doesn't sound good.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.681
They're each pretty
harmless on their own, but

16:21.781 --> 16:23.483
somehow this kid found a way

16:23.583 --> 16:26.853
to use them to build an
incredibly power cipher.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.522
Kasie.
How powerful?

16:29.622 --> 16:33.326
Think a digital key that
could be used to bypass

16:33.426 --> 16:35.928
any security measure
imaginable.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.399
From simple passwords to
state-level encryption.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.068
Well, that definitely
sounds bad.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.903
A universal key like
this could be used to

16:44.003 --> 16:45.805
rob banks, to hold

16:45.905 --> 16:48.575
entire cities'
power grids hostage.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.942
Take down planes?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.911
In the wrong hands,

16:52.011 --> 16:53.613
it could create

16:53.713 --> 16:56.483
global chaos.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.127
How could a single
college kid compromise

17:07.227 --> 17:08.495
so many government agencies?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.029
Anacostia's home to the DIA.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.999
It's possible that
Watson used his base access

17:13.100 --> 17:14.234
to get into their system.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.535
From there he could
have leapfrogged

17:15.635 --> 17:17.370
from one agency
server to another.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.072
Homeland security
is in the process of

17:19.172 --> 17:22.609
changing the access codes
across all government servers.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.511
That's gonna take some time.
Right.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.778
Meanwhile, their director's

17:25.878 --> 17:27.147
breathing down my neck
for answers.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.649
JBAB technicians just confirmed

17:29.749 --> 17:31.084
that all servers there
are secure.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.986
Well, that rules out DIA
as an access point.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.690
So how the hell
did this kid get in?

17:37.790 --> 17:41.060
There's a possibility that
we have yet to discuss.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.865
DELILAH:
I can't believe

17:45.965 --> 17:48.268
Vance and Parker think I
have something to do with this.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.836
Honey, we wouldn't
be doing our job

17:49.936 --> 17:52.305
if we didn't look into this,
given your proximity

17:52.405 --> 17:53.740
to Will and your
government clearance.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.242
I'm-I'm sure
there's nothing there.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.044
Do you realize how dangerous
this thing could be

17:58.145 --> 17:59.146
in the wrong hands?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.380
Of course.
I told them

18:00.480 --> 18:01.948
you'd never be this reckless.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.816
Will wouldn't either.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.619
He was a first-year
computer science major.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.289
I mean, he was brilliant,
but this is beyond.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.923
He could not have done this.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.393
Well, maybe he had help.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.429
(gasps)

18:16.529 --> 18:18.331
What? You-you okay?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.032
He did have help.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.434
You see this?

18:21.534 --> 18:22.502
Yeah, it's how Will was able

18:22.602 --> 18:24.003
to hop from server to server.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.440
This is a program
I wrote in grad school

18:27.540 --> 18:30.143
that would allow computers
to talk to each other offline.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.412
I could never get it to work.
I guess Will did.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.515
How did he get your code?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.418
He was struggling and-and
wanted to drop the class

18:38.518 --> 18:40.086
and I thought that maybe
showing him

18:40.187 --> 18:43.523
some of my past failures
would help him realize

18:43.623 --> 18:44.624
that we all start somewhere.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.426
He must have copied it.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.560
Well, you had
no way of knowing

18:47.660 --> 18:49.162
what he was gonna do with it.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.831
But that doesn't change the fact
that I'm responsible for this.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.367
I could lose my job,
my government clearance.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.702
I could go to prison.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.036
Honey, you are not
gonna go to prison.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.872
Listen, I will explain
to the director that

18:59.972 --> 19:01.774
you were an unwilling
participant, okay?

19:01.874 --> 19:05.512
I just wish you hadn't
kept him a secret.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.779
You know, it
makes it harder

19:06.879 --> 19:08.248
to get out in front
of this thing.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.882
I didn't keep him a secret.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.718
Well, you didn't tell
me about him either.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.621
I'm sure I must have
mentioned him at some point.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.156
Delilah, I would have remembered
you having weekly

19:17.257 --> 19:19.125
off-campus meetings, okay?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.394
What are you getting at?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.063
Uh, forget I said anything.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.465
Never-never mind.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.435
Sounds like you're jealous.
I am not jealous.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.737
Tell me what it is, then.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.608
You know what, I'll give you
some time to think about it

19:35.708 --> 19:37.777
while I go explain
to the director

19:37.877 --> 19:39.779
what's going on myself.
Delilah, wait.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.815
Don't follow me, Tim.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.686
We'll finish this
conversation tonight.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.825
Oh, uh, i-is it just me

19:52.925 --> 19:55.228
or was it exceptionally
brisk this morning?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.430
KNIGHT:
I felt a chill
this morning, yes.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.832
Alexa, how cold is it outside?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.535
ALEXA:
Today in Washington D.C.,

20:02.635 --> 20:05.638
expect a low of 44 degrees
Fahrenheit.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.540
I would have said 43.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.975
KASIE:
It is a good thing that

20:09.075 --> 20:11.344
you are a federal agent
and not a meteorologist.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.679
(both laugh weakly)

20:12.779 --> 20:14.213
Oh.
Oh, hey.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.517
Hey. Um, how much of that
did you hear?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.218
Ninety percent, tops.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.254
I'd say about 95.
Mm.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.423
I hate to add to your
problems right now,

20:23.523 --> 20:25.057
but we got a big one.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.526
Well, lay it on me.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.461
Metadata from Watson's laptop

20:28.561 --> 20:33.466
shows the key was downloaded
to an external drive.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.001
He made a copy.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.136
But we didn't find any
external drives in his room.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.838
So where is it?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.174
I didn't think anything
about it at the crime scene,

20:42.275 --> 20:45.712
but it looks like something's
been ripped off here.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.315
Uh, Kase, pull up
the CCTV footage from the alley.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.652
Punch in.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.456
There it is.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.391
It looks like a USB drive.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.859
It's gone now.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.993
Someone could have stolen it.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.562
Any DNA or prints
on the key ring?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.597
Uh, no, it was wiped.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.132
Super wiped.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.036
With bleach.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.805
Remind me again what happened
to your shirt.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.344
I accidentally used bleach
instead of laundry detergent.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.745
That's not a crime.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.780
Well, some would say
a grown man not knowing

21:20.880 --> 21:22.449
how to wash his own
laundry is a crime,

21:22.549 --> 21:24.517
but potato, "potahto."
(chuckles)

21:24.617 --> 21:27.787
I think you used
the bleach on purpose...

21:33.926 --> 21:35.695
...to wipe off Will's keys.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.330
Why would I do that?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.666
To cover up the fact that
you took something off of them

21:39.766 --> 21:41.033
before he died.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.436
I mean, you did say that
you wanted to kill Will.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.605
I was being funny.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.640
That was hilarious.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.008
I never touched Will's keys

21:49.108 --> 21:50.477
and I didn't give him drugs.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.045
You can't arrest me
for something I didn't do.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.583
What could we arrest him for?

21:56.683 --> 21:57.884
Obstruction of justice?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.452
Oh, that's a good one.
That's, like, five.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.053
Ten years, actually.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.623
Especially if the obstruction is
related to domestic terrorism.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.691
Terrorism?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.125
Ooh, you know what that means.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.560
Mm-hmm. Supermax.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.429
Okay, okay, I'll tell you
whatever you want to know,

22:09.529 --> 22:11.130
but I didn't kill him.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.000
Okay, let's try this again.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.104
What's missing here?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.473
Some kind of flash drive,
I think.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.874
I don't know what's on it.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.309
You spent almost every
waking moment with Will.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.877
He never mentioned
anything about it?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.814
He never mentioned
anything to anyone.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.949
I tried to be a good brother,
get to know him,

22:30.049 --> 22:32.184
but the dude
was weirdly secretive.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.586
Paranoid, even.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.221
What makes you say that?

22:35.321 --> 22:37.657
How about the time
will punched Jared in the face?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.025
Which one was Jared again?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.828
He's the one who called us old.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.930
For the record,
she and I are very young.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.132
Why did Will
punch Jared in the face?

22:46.232 --> 22:48.067
Will found Jared
poking around his room,

22:48.167 --> 22:50.870
assumed he was stealing,
just started whaling on him.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.872
Did Will get
written up for that?

22:52.972 --> 22:55.307
Yeah, that's not how it works.
And to be honest, that

22:55.408 --> 22:57.877
dude was bound
to get punched eventually.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.812
Elaborate on that.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.450
So, pledges are supposed to wait
on active members hand and foot.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.917
Jared was never around.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.319
Other guys had enough
picking up his slack.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.988
Will wanted to report him
to the national board.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.323
So you're saying that
Jared killed Will

23:11.424 --> 23:13.826
because Will was gonna
tattle on him?

23:13.926 --> 23:17.363
You're the investigators.
You tell me.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.469
KNIGHT:
There's a lot about Jared Baker
that doesn't add up.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.771
First red flag:

23:24.871 --> 23:26.238
he has about

23:26.338 --> 23:28.941
$500,000 tied up
in an offshore account.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.843
Where'd he get
that kind of money?

23:30.943 --> 23:32.879
The money was deposited
right around the same time

23:32.979 --> 23:34.547
as he joined, uh, Delta Pi Beta,

23:34.647 --> 23:37.517
six weeks after the rest
of the pledge class.
All right.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.887
So Jared somehow finds out
about the access key, then

23:40.987 --> 23:42.421
joins the fraternity
to get close enough

23:42.522 --> 23:43.956
to Watson to steal it?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.925
Maybe that's why Jared
was poking around his room.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.027
And why Watson punched
him in the face for it.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.830
(sighs) Technology like that
would sell for way more

23:50.930 --> 23:52.732
than 500K
on the black market, right?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.333
Well, could be a down payment.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.402
And Jared could be getting
the other half on delivery.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.037
All right,
then let's scoop him up

23:58.137 --> 24:00.239
before he has a chance
to close the deal.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.043
(indistinct chatter)

24:05.912 --> 24:08.214
Circled the perimeter.
House seems pretty quiet.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.517
Probably out
on a beer run.
Mm.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.151
Parker, anything?

24:13.019 --> 24:14.887
PARKER:
Torres, where's
that pizza from?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.956
Pizzeria Diablo. Why?

24:17.056 --> 24:19.592
That's the best
Neapolitan place in town.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.494
Frat parties have changed

24:21.594 --> 24:23.029
since I was in college.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.697
I'm guessing a lot has changed

24:24.797 --> 24:26.599
since he was in college.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.902
Guessing you, uh, didn't mean
to say that one out loud, huh?

24:30.002 --> 24:32.705
(exhales)
You guessed correctly.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.374
(music playing)
(engine revs)

24:35.474 --> 24:36.709
All right, Torres, Knight,

24:36.809 --> 24:38.310
there's our guy.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.481
(car doors close)

24:43.650 --> 24:45.618
Hey, Jared.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.887
You remember us?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.222
Got a runner!
Stop!

24:52.191 --> 24:53.125
He's headed your way!

24:53.225 --> 24:54.694
All right, we got him.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.929
NCIS! Stop!

25:01.734 --> 25:03.035
He's going for the van!

25:06.272 --> 25:08.340
Damn it!

25:08.440 --> 25:09.475
Parker, let's go.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.077
Don't bother.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.080
Hey, what the
hell was that?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.415
Did that kid just
carjack a dog groomer?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.784
PARKER:
No, he did not.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.819
Molly's Mobile Dog Grooming
is a fake business

25:19.919 --> 25:21.654
used for undercover operations.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.123
Undercover operations by whom?

25:24.223 --> 25:26.559
The FBI.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.896
We've been chasing an agent.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.871
NCIS should have been read in

25:38.971 --> 25:40.907
the minute this became
a murder case.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.375
I'm supposed to be the one
who's mad here. Your team almost

25:43.475 --> 25:45.511
blew my cover.
Agent Clarkson,

25:45.612 --> 25:47.246
might I remind you

25:47.346 --> 25:49.481
Director Sweeney himself
sent you over here this morning

25:49.582 --> 25:51.550
so you'd cooperate
with our team.

25:51.651 --> 25:55.688
So, what's an undercover
FBI agent doing in a frat house?

25:56.488 --> 25:57.957
I'm part of a special unit
responsible

25:58.057 --> 26:00.627
for ferreting out foreign spies
on college campuses.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.961
IP theft has become one

26:02.061 --> 26:03.495
of our biggest
national security concerns.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.964
Not a bad gig.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.934
You try being 37
and living in a frat house.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.737
Did he say thirty seven?

26:10.837 --> 26:12.238
Hey, you called me old.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.973
I didn't use those words.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.308
And I'm sorry
about the "parents" dig,

26:16.408 --> 26:17.677
but I had to maintain my cover.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.311
Yeah. Sure, whatever.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.480
How do you keep your skin
that smooth?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.515
More importantly,

26:23.616 --> 26:26.418
how does an NROTC midshipman

26:26.518 --> 26:27.954
factor into
a collegiate spy ring?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.221
Our intel says

26:29.321 --> 26:30.757
that Will Watson was recruited

26:30.857 --> 26:32.458
by Belarus
to build the access key.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.861
I was placed
in the frat house to recover it.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.096
I assume you didn't succeed
or we wouldn't be here now.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.632
No, but I was able
to clone the burner Watson used

26:39.732 --> 26:41.233
to communicate with his handler.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.235
You got an ID on the handler?

26:43.335 --> 26:44.570
They used a cipher so advanced

26:44.671 --> 26:46.238
that even our best techs
haven't been able

26:46.338 --> 26:47.907
to decode the messages.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.508
Well, maybe NCIS
can make some progress

26:49.608 --> 26:51.510
where the FBI could not.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.980
Look, I'll give you
whatever I have

26:54.080 --> 26:55.614
if it means
I never have to step foot

26:55.715 --> 26:57.750
in that disgusting
frat house ever again.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.485
KASIE:
We have already tried

26:59.585 --> 27:00.820
every cipher
known to man.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.488
(sighs)
I'm out of ideas.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.523
Well, we could try
a brute force attack.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.392
And be here till next Wednesday?

27:06.492 --> 27:08.327
(scoffs)
Oh.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.496
You know who we should call?

27:10.596 --> 27:12.899
No. No, no, no.
She's been through enough.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.634
It is very nice that you are
trying to protect your wife,

27:15.735 --> 27:19.538
but this is Delilah's
exact area of expertise.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.907
I am sure she'd like to help.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.109
Delilah does not
need my protection, okay?

27:23.209 --> 27:25.011
And we can handle this
on our own.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.680
Please tell me
you apologized for yesterday.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.182
I did.
But I'll be honest with you.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.819
I don't feel great about
where we left things last night.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.154
I don't feel great
about it, either.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.725
I was just about
to tell you that...

27:38.825 --> 27:41.227
Kasie called me 20 minutes ago.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.629
You know what?

27:43.730 --> 27:46.498
I am going to...

27:47.166 --> 27:49.969
Alexa, what's on
my to-do list for today?

27:50.069 --> 27:53.639
ALEXA:
You have one item
on your to-do list.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.975
Drink more water.
Thank God.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.110
Um, Kasie?
You heard the lady.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.411
I got to hydrate.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.513
You have a fridge
full of bottled water.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.115
We are in
a climate crisis, McGee,

28:03.215 --> 28:05.317
and I'm trying to reduce
my carbon footprint, so...

28:05.417 --> 28:06.886
Can't argue with that.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.889
Please fix this
by the time I get back.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.559
We have work to do
and we need her help.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.632
Well, Kasie's right.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.601
We got work to do.
We need to talk.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.203
We can't work together

28:24.303 --> 28:26.672
unless we're gonna
be honest with each other.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.008
I wasn't intentionally
keeping anything from you.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.376
I'm so sorry.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.911
No, I-I... I know you weren't.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.846
And I'm the one that's sorry,
okay? I-I feel terrible.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.782
Oh, not as terrible as I feel

28:35.882 --> 28:38.650
watching you torture yourself
over this novel.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.120
What do you mean?
The novel is going great.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.623
I'm just, you know,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.725
having some trouble
getting started.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.929
You've been stuck
on page three for weeks.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.431
In fact...

28:52.531 --> 28:57.169
you've barely written a word
since Gibbs left for Alaska.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.271
Hey.

28:59.371 --> 29:02.208
Gibbs is not
what makes you great.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.575
Yeah, but Thom E. Gemcity

29:03.675 --> 29:05.077
may never have
another idea without him.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.614
You are the most creative person
I have ever met.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.682
You will have more ideas.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.684
You just need a new muse.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.954
Yeah, you're probably right.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.189
You usually are.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.558
I wish you would have
told me this earlier.

29:19.658 --> 29:21.160
I could have helped.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.562
Well, you've been so happy
since you started teaching.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.197
I didn't want
to bring you down with me.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.499
I love solving problems
with you, Tim.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.069
We're a team.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.239
Well, can we
work on solving

29:33.339 --> 29:35.207
this particular problem
a little bit later?

29:35.307 --> 29:38.077
I think Kasie's water bottle
is probably overflowing by now.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.212
Mm-hmm. Okay.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.716
KNIGHT:
Our victim was a spy?

29:44.817 --> 29:46.352
The FBI believes that

29:46.452 --> 29:49.989
Watson was recruited by Belarus
after he got to campus,

29:50.089 --> 29:51.991
by a handler who was already
embedded at the school.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.126
Assuming they stuck
to their regular schedule,

29:54.226 --> 29:56.595
Watson was supposed to meet
the handler the day he died.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.664
Well, maybe
our handler's the killer.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.032
Oh, that makes sense.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.834
Once the access key
is operational,

30:01.934 --> 30:04.536
Watson becomes more
of a liability than an asset.
Ah.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.605
If we can figure out
where they met,

30:06.705 --> 30:09.241
maybe we can ID the handler.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.944
Well, Watson lost the USB drive
somewhere between the café

30:12.044 --> 30:15.014
where he met Delilah
and the street where he died.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.916
Yeah, we did our best
to track his movements,

30:17.016 --> 30:18.918
but there is a ten-minute period
where he's unaccounted for.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.521
So, if the handler
did steal the access key

30:22.621 --> 30:24.756
they would have done so
within a five-block radius

30:24.857 --> 30:25.824
of the café.

30:25.925 --> 30:26.859
That still leaves us

30:26.959 --> 30:28.160
with hundreds of suspects.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.695
I don't like those odds.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.763
Well, our odds are about
to improve significantly.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.166
I know how we can decode
the messages on Will's burner.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.534
How?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.769
Use Will's own invention
against him.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.040
FBI techs said the messages
were undecipherable,

30:41.140 --> 30:42.708
even with Watson's access key.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.176
Which is why I made my own.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.213
Watson developed his key
using pieces of a program

30:47.313 --> 30:49.781
that Delilah created
15 years ago.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.551
(sighs) I could never
get it to work back then,

30:52.651 --> 30:54.853
but after seeing the way
Will modified it,

30:54.954 --> 30:57.256
I realized my mistake.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.292
Does creating
an even more powerful cipher

31:00.392 --> 31:02.628
sound like a bad idea
to anyone else?

31:02.728 --> 31:03.963
Oh, it's a very bad idea.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.264
Which is why
we are going

31:05.364 --> 31:07.099
to destroy the cipher
immediately after

31:07.199 --> 31:08.968
we figure out
who Watson was working with.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.803
And the rest of you are going
to forget you ever saw this.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.539
That will not be a problem.

31:13.639 --> 31:14.840
I don't even know what this is.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.842
All right. Here we go.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.681
Nice work, Delilah.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.084
Seems like
NCIS hired the wrong McGee.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.655
McGEE:
You got to be kidding.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.557
You know who the handler is?

31:31.657 --> 31:34.326
Yeah. We've met.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.298
(door opens)

31:39.398 --> 31:40.732
Hello, Evelyn.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.434
Agent Torres.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.103
You know Agent McGee.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.471
Tim, hi.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.605
Oh.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.407
I mean, Agent McGee.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.542
I'm sorry. I just feel like
I know you so well.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.980
Thanks for, uh, coming in
on such short notice.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.215
Are you kidding?
This is so cool.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.217
I feel like
I'm in one of your books.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.819
Yeah, and tell me something,
Agent Torres.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.888
As an investigator yourself,

32:02.989 --> 32:05.224
how accurate
is the Deep Six series?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.126
All right, let's
leave the book club thing

32:07.226 --> 32:08.794
till after we're done, yeah?

32:08.894 --> 32:10.929
Of course.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.832
I am more than happy
to assist NCIS

32:13.932 --> 32:15.234
in your investigation.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.136
Great.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.138
All right, well, let's start
with, uh, where you were

32:19.238 --> 32:21.940
between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m.
on the day Will died.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.477
Uh, in the library prepping
for Delilah's class.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.280
Okay, we'll have to have
an agent verify that.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.449
Mm, uh, yeah, go ahead.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.051
(chuckles)
Why would I lie?

32:32.151 --> 32:34.386
Well, you've been lying
to us this whole time,

32:34.486 --> 32:37.023
so, why stop now?

32:37.823 --> 32:40.526
I'm telling the truth,
Agent Torres.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.761
Okay, then what can you tell us

32:42.861 --> 32:44.296
about your relationship
with Will?

32:44.396 --> 32:47.399
I mean, outside
of grading his papers,

32:47.499 --> 32:49.135
I didn't really know him.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.770
Do you often text coded messages

32:51.870 --> 32:54.106
to people you don't really know?

32:54.206 --> 32:55.907
Ugh.

32:56.008 --> 32:59.578
Okay. Okay, that's
what this is about?

32:59.678 --> 33:01.547
Oh. I can explain.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.914
Well, I can't wait to hear.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.250
Yeah, it was for class.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.385
So, um, everyone
created their own code

33:06.485 --> 33:08.454
and then swapped
to see whose they could break.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.756
Will's code is
pretty sophisticated.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.324
(scoffs)
I know, right?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.093
I was really impressed.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.863
It's actually what attracted me
to him in the first place.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.299
Ah, so you two were involved?

33:20.399 --> 33:24.070
If anyone found out,
I-I could lose my scholarship.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.438
So-so we just figured that if...

33:26.538 --> 33:28.874
if we communicated
using his code,

33:28.974 --> 33:31.143
we'd keep our secret.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.245
Hmm. Yeah, that's a cool story.

33:33.345 --> 33:37.216
Except the messages
tell a different one.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.617
We decoded them.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.019
Yeah. Okay.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.022
Now who's lying, Agent Torres?

33:44.123 --> 33:46.292
That's impossible.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.826
For most people.

33:47.926 --> 33:50.229
Yeah, his wife
is not most people.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.466
See, the real
story is that

33:54.566 --> 33:57.603
Will Watson was a foreign agent
and you were his handler.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.438
But you two had

33:59.538 --> 34:01.107
different ideologies.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.908
You were mission-focused

34:03.008 --> 34:05.311
but Will was starting to care
more about having a traditional

34:05.411 --> 34:08.914
college experience and he
felt bad about using Delilah.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.916
He became a liability,

34:11.016 --> 34:13.085
so you had to take him out.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.787
You poisoned him
and you stole the USB drive.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.257
Mission accomplished.

34:20.759 --> 34:24.530
I already told you I was
in the library, Agent McGee.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.234
Will was never in the library
that morning, was he?

34:28.334 --> 34:30.436
Really got to
hand it to her.

34:30.536 --> 34:31.937
She's a phenomenal liar.

34:32.037 --> 34:35.941
I know. I thought she was
a cheerleader from Fresno.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.543
By way of Minsk.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.211
She left out that part.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.180
VANCE:
Breaking her

34:41.280 --> 34:43.014
is the only way
we're gonna find the key.

34:43.115 --> 34:44.950
Let's not waste
our time, Director.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.818
She was telling the
truth about one thing.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.820
She really was in the library?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.622
Yup. Her alibi checks out.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.925
She is a foreign agent but she
could not have killed Watson.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.563
Which means that access key
is still out there.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.176
The FBI thanks you,
Ms. Fielding.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.344
Is thanks really enough?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.780
I mean, you should be
sending her a fruit basket.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.652
I did kind of catch a spy
for them, didn't I?
Hmm.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.053
But we still have
to find that access key.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.655
Can you text the nanny
and tell her

35:23.755 --> 35:25.457
we will be home late?

35:25.557 --> 35:26.925
Uh, no, but I can ask her
to watch the kids

35:27.025 --> 35:28.494
while you go home
and get some rest.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.828
(short chuckle)
Are you being serious right now?

35:29.928 --> 35:32.264
I am not going anywhere
until we find the key.

35:32.364 --> 35:35.234
Hey, if Delilah is offering
to help, we'll take it.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.670
Not that you're not enough
all by yourself, McGee.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.473
So, where are we?
Classic dead end.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.275
Watson's classmates
are the obvious suspects.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.344
They're the only ones
who might have understood

35:45.444 --> 35:46.945
the value of the access key.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.147
We triple-checked their alibis,
and they're all solid.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.116
There's got to be something
we're missing.

35:51.217 --> 35:54.220
Not something. Someone.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.087
This isn't
the original roster.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.389
There was this kid--

35:57.489 --> 35:58.490
um, Logan--

35:58.590 --> 35:59.625
who failed the first project

35:59.725 --> 36:01.760
and-and quit
the class after that.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.731
You mean this Logan?
Yeah, that's him.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.866
That's Watson's roommate.
Where do we find him?

36:07.966 --> 36:10.101
I'm logging in
to his student account.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.608
This is strange.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.110
Looks like
Logan backdoored his way

36:19.211 --> 36:21.146
into Waverly's main server
two days ago.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.349
Well, he must have
used the access key.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.750
What was he after?

36:24.850 --> 36:27.152
On Waverly's server?
Could be anything from

36:27.253 --> 36:28.687
government R and D to

36:28.787 --> 36:31.657
contact information
of the nation's top officials.

36:31.757 --> 36:32.824
Well, it looks like
we didn't get rid

36:32.924 --> 36:34.460
of all the Waverly spies.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.161
All right, let's go
finish the job.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.900
McGEE:
Anyone have eyes on our target?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.271
Cell phone ping
puts him within 50 yards.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.206
Negative. Knight?

36:48.307 --> 36:49.441
Negative.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.477
A lot of civilians.
I don't like it.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.480
That's why we got to move fast,
take him down without weapons.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.415
KNIGHT:
So, I have a question.

36:56.515 --> 36:59.251
With all the undercover agents
and foreign spies,

36:59.351 --> 37:01.353
are there any students
who actually go to Waverly?

37:01.453 --> 37:04.790
I don't know, but if we lose
this guy to another dog groomer,

37:04.890 --> 37:06.892
it's gonna be bye-bye,
calm Torres.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.760
Ooh, what would
Dr. Grace say?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.597
McGee, got a visual
on, uh, the suspect.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.131
Guy on a scooter.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.267
All right, I'm on him.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.569
(indistinct conversations)

37:21.473 --> 37:22.708
Oh, he made me.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.714
If you can slow him down,
I got him.

37:28.814 --> 37:29.981
No problem.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.919
Sorry.
Official government business.

37:35.554 --> 37:38.924
NCIS!
All right, back off, back off.
Give us some room.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.892
Get up.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.363
Way to improvise, Knight.
Your aim is impeccable.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.532
Thanks. I was captain

37:46.632 --> 37:48.700
of the disc golf team
in college.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.135
Where's the USB drive?

37:50.235 --> 37:51.803
It's in my pocket.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.543
I-I would have given it
back if you'd asked.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.778
Well, you didn't give us a
chance to. You started running.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.280
I thought you were gonna
arrest me for giving Will drugs.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.750
I did it so I could get
to his flash drive.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.284
I didn't know he'd have
that kind of reaction.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.219
That's the least
of your problems right now.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.855
PARKER:
You know what's
worse is violating

38:09.955 --> 38:11.457
the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act.

38:11.557 --> 38:14.826
Or the Espionage Act.
You're not a very good spy.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.896
Spy? That's because I'm not one.
TORRES: Yeah,

38:17.996 --> 38:19.130
that's what they all say.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.566
All right, look,
just hold up, hold up.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.234
Logan, right?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.704
If you weren't spying

38:25.804 --> 38:28.674
then why did you access
the school's server?

38:28.774 --> 38:30.609
(sighs)

38:30.709 --> 38:32.411
DELILAH:
Changing his grades?

38:32.511 --> 38:35.213
(laughs) Like Matthew Broderick
in WarGames?

38:35.313 --> 38:38.216
Yup. Solid reference,
by the way.
Hmm.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.752
Well, I guess it's nice to know
at least one of my students

38:40.852 --> 38:43.221
was just a cheater, not a spy.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.223
Logan said he didn't
consider it cheating.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.858
Said he would have gotten

38:46.958 --> 38:50.061
all A's if he hadn't spent
so much time pledging DPB.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.231
Nowhere in the multiverse is
that kid getting straight A's.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.266
Well, I'm just glad
the last few days

38:55.367 --> 38:58.036
haven't ruined your passion
for teaching, you know?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.138
I mean, you're so good at it.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.240
Well, I might have you
do background checks

39:02.340 --> 39:03.609
on future students.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.876
Hmm.
But

39:04.976 --> 39:06.445
I don't know,
how many professors

39:06.545 --> 39:08.013
get to say
their side gig is

39:08.113 --> 39:10.749
catching spies
with their husband?
Hmm.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.485
Tim?

39:13.585 --> 39:14.620
Hmm?

39:14.720 --> 39:16.087
You okay?

39:16.187 --> 39:18.824
Yeah. Sorry.
I'm, uh, I'm just tired.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.627
(sighs)
You can't stay up all night

39:21.727 --> 39:23.061
staring at a blank page.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.930
I'm really starting to worry.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.198
Well, if it makes you
feel any better, I actually

39:27.298 --> 39:30.035
got more writing done last night
than I have in months.

39:30.135 --> 39:30.902
Yeah?

39:31.002 --> 39:31.970
Yeah. You were right.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.338
Just needed a new muse.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.206
That's so great.
Mm.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.875
Oh, and your fans
will be so excited

39:36.975 --> 39:39.010
to read a new Deep Six mystery.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.346
L.J. Tibbs is retired, remember?
Yeah.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.582
So I have a new main character

39:43.682 --> 39:46.652
that I think the fans are
gonna love just as much as I do.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.654
Well, are you gonna
tell me about him?

39:48.754 --> 39:50.255
It's a her.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.559
She is a beautiful,
brilliant, cryptologist

39:53.659 --> 39:56.261
by the name of Delena Fleming.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.765
And does Delena

39:59.865 --> 40:03.902
get to solve cases with
her equally-brilliant husband?

40:04.002 --> 40:06.705
Well, you'll just
have to wait and see.
