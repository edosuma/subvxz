00:02.903 --> 00:04.238
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.406
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.608
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.211
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.244 --> 00:11.479
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.512 --> 00:13.281
or to tear us apart.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.548
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.582 --> 00:16.484
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.517 --> 00:18.619
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.652 --> 00:20.454
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.523
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.392
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.425 --> 00:26.394
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.427 --> 00:28.129
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.162 --> 00:30.164
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.133
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.166 --> 00:34.568
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.602 --> 00:37.405
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.438 --> 00:40.374
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.408 --> 00:42.810
you.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.044
Let's get to work.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.515
(panting)

00:49.317 --> 00:51.385
YOUNG MAN:
I'm almost to the top.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.427
I'm on top of the parking lot
right now.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.629
It's close, I can see it.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.503
(exhales)

01:12.506 --> 01:14.475
(exhales)

01:23.584 --> 01:27.321
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.458
(mutters indistinctly)

01:33.727 --> 01:35.529
(distant thump)
(car alarm wails)

01:37.465 --> 01:39.267
(car alarm continuing)
(quietly): Oh...

01:39.300 --> 01:43.204
Man. That is rough.

01:43.237 --> 01:47.375
How old was he?

01:47.408 --> 01:49.677
15. His name's
Evan Zymuski.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.481
So, I mean, on the one hand,

01:53.514 --> 01:55.616
it's a cut-and-dried
suicide, right?

01:55.649 --> 01:56.884
But?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.586
But I don't know, it's just...

01:58.619 --> 02:00.221
something strange about it.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.655
Did he leave
a message

02:01.689 --> 02:04.292
or a note anywhere?
That's what's weird.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.893
No message, no note.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.495
Look...

02:07.528 --> 02:09.563
he erased all social media,

02:09.597 --> 02:11.299
but he leaves his phone behind
on the roof.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.302
The only thing on them
were these videos.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.403
There are more videos?
Yeah.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.638
Ten of 'em,
including the jump.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.242
They're all just selfies
and stupid stunts.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.676
It's everything from
cutting himself

02:22.710 --> 02:25.946
to climbing a
construction crane.
So maybe

02:25.979 --> 02:28.616
he was an adrenaline junkie
that just took it too far.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.220
No, his parents say that
he's the quiet loner type.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.389
He never liked to take risks.
And there's something

02:35.423 --> 02:37.425
that he says at the end here,
I just...

02:37.458 --> 02:41.295
can't quite get it.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.163
(mutters indistinctly)

02:45.699 --> 02:47.268
Yeah, I can't hear him either.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.371
Well, I know who can.

02:53.607 --> 02:57.411
Jeffrey.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.280
Can I have a moment?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.514
Yeah. What
you got?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.416
So ever since

03:02.450 --> 03:04.418
we posted all of Mia's
personal stuff online,

03:04.452 --> 03:06.687
there's this sub-group of users

03:06.720 --> 03:09.323
who've been obsessed
with her last video.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.492
Do I want to hear this?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.295
No, no, relax, they're not...
they're not fixated on Mia.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.964
They're fixated on something
in the background.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.666
This.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.536
What is that?

03:22.570 --> 03:25.339
Is that a sweater?
SARA: Mm-hmm.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.576
Not a single photo has ever
been posted of her wearing it.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.644
Or of her with anyone
wearing it, either.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.646
I've seen this video
a million times

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
and I've never noticed that.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.550
My eyes were always
on Mia.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.589
The group who posted it,

03:41.622 --> 03:44.258
it's a bunch of young mothers
who call themselves

03:44.292 --> 03:45.526
the "Mama Mias."

03:45.559 --> 03:47.695
Well...
They think it's important.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.465
What do
you think?

03:51.499 --> 03:52.533
I think we should let

03:52.566 --> 03:55.569
Sophe decide.
Agreed.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.238
Move it to the front page.
Let's see what we get.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.010
Ah.
(clears throat)

04:03.043 --> 04:05.279
Incoming.
Mm.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.650
Admit it, you're starting
to like it around here.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.819
Like a root canal.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.588
What can we, uh,
do for you, Detective?

04:14.622 --> 04:17.525
Sophe's good at deciphering
garbled audio, right?

04:17.558 --> 04:18.792
Something crowds are
useful for.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.596
Look at him.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.699
What? I read Crowdsourcing
For Dummies, okay? Sue me.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.536
As it happens,
the Dummies guide is not wrong.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.671
Yes, that is something the crowd
is very good at.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.373
What have you,
uh, got there?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.408
(sighs)

04:34.442 --> 04:35.809
The last words
of a 15-year-old kid

04:35.843 --> 04:37.345
before he killed himself.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.549
Let's listen to it.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.654
EVAN (voice distorted):
I'm sorry, Mom...

04:46.687 --> 04:48.489
(indistinct muttering)

04:50.391 --> 04:52.460
See, there's a lot
of car noise and wind.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.727
It makes it hard to hear.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.330
To me it sounds like
"Cat had ticks..."

04:56.364 --> 04:58.632
(all quickly groan)

04:58.666 --> 05:00.701
What?
I really wish you hadn't
said that.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.670
Why, what does that mean?
Nothing.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.405
But you've just created
a confirmation bias.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.707
What?
In essence, you've
infected our ears.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.076
What the hell's that mean?
It means that that's now

05:09.109 --> 05:10.678
all we can hear.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.913
(indistinct muttering repeats)

05:12.946 --> 05:14.682
Damn that cat.
It's not a problem.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.083
When I put the phrase
out on Sophe,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.585
we'll compartmentalize
the users

05:17.618 --> 05:19.753
to make sure there's
no cross-talk.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.854
Perfect. That way,
each user will hear

05:20.888 --> 05:22.390
the phrase fresh,
with no bias.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.425
Now we wait.
(phone rings)

05:24.458 --> 05:26.394
Cavanaugh.

05:34.802 --> 05:38.372
SARA: Jeffrey...
Sophe deciphered Evan
Zymuski's last words

05:38.406 --> 05:39.373
The reason we couldn't
understand is because

05:39.407 --> 05:40.508
it's in Russian.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.643
"Desyats zolotix shagov."

05:42.676 --> 05:44.712
It means "The Ten
Golden Steps."

05:44.745 --> 05:46.614
Ten golden steps?
SARA:
Mm-hmm.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.816
We couldn't find any reference
to the exact phrase online,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.484
so we broadened
the search, and...

05:50.518 --> 05:51.619
We found the
"Ten Steps to Nirvana."

05:51.652 --> 05:53.854
It's tied to a string
of suicides

05:53.887 --> 05:56.924
last year in Argentina--
12 kids died.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.527
JOSH: Here's another from Russia
four years ago.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.694
"Ten Steps to Immortality."

06:00.728 --> 06:02.463
11 kids.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.665
Japan had one, too--
"The Ten Steps of Solace."

06:04.698 --> 06:06.967
14 kids.
And now we have this.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.602
Every one of these
outbreaks

06:08.636 --> 06:09.970
started with a single suicide,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.739
and then it just spread.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.507
Like a virus.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.948
(phone ringing)

06:20.981 --> 06:23.484
What do you got for me?
TANNER: Nothing good.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.718
Based on our findings,

06:24.752 --> 06:27.421
this kid's suicide
may just be the first.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.922
I'm way ahead of you.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.492
We got another one.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.628
Desyats zolotix shagov.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.470
*

06:53.013 --> 06:54.848
Two teen suicides, ten
almost-identical selfie videos

06:54.882 --> 06:56.584
and the same Russian phrase.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.519
I mean, what the hell are we
dealing with here, guys?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.187
From what we can tell,
the first of these

07:00.220 --> 07:02.189
suicide games was in Russia
four years ago.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.824
Did you just call this a game?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.193
Dude, don't blame us,
blame the press.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.897
Alexei Kerlov-- he's
a Russian online troll.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.898
He launched the first version.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.466
He was caught, but not before

07:12.500 --> 07:14.535
12 Russian teenagers
had killed themselves.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.537
Yeah, this is the third
documented copycat.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.539
The specifics change,
the outcome doesn't.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.641
In every version we've seen,
this is the first step--

07:20.674 --> 07:22.510
the self-harm,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.945
followed by the increasingly
dangerous behavior.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.814
It's like they've
been programmed.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.948
CAVANAUGH: Yeah, but
what I don't get is

07:27.981 --> 07:29.550
who would fall for this?

07:29.583 --> 07:32.219
Why play along knowing
it ends in suicide?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.153
Maybe they didn't know that
when it started,

07:33.186 --> 07:35.623
and then by the time
they figured it out,

07:35.656 --> 07:37.825
they couldn't break away.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.226
What I don't get is how
these kids are finding the game,

07:39.259 --> 07:41.194
where they get the instructions.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.530
I mean, there's not a single
mention of it online.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.097
It's completely off the radar.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.667
Well, look, they have
to connect somewhere.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.538
To get ahead of this thing,
we need to figure that part out.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.106
Maybe one of the victims'
families might have an idea.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.976
The girl today, she was
a freshman at UCSF,

07:56.009 --> 07:57.110
and her parents are
flying in.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.580
But maybe we can go back
and talk to the Zymuskis again.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.981
Take Tariq with you.
TARIQ: Sure.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.249
Tariq?
No, I've got this.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.117
Are you sure?
Yes.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.987
Uh...

08:11.224 --> 08:13.060
...do you want us to post
all this on Sophe, or...?

08:13.093 --> 08:15.262
No, no, no, not yet.
Okay.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.602
It's right here.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.137
(clears throat)
Thank you.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.913
Sorry, it's
kind of messy.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.582
I haven't straightened up yet.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.917
No, no, it's fine,
Mrs. Zymuski.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.019
We're just trying to
get a feel for Evan, that's all.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.688
I'm sorry for
the intrusion.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.957
We're just still
so confused,

08:43.991 --> 08:47.294
so anything that
brings answers...

08:47.327 --> 08:49.697
CAVANAUGH:
Was there anyone new
in Evan's life

08:49.730 --> 08:50.964
in the past few weeks?

08:50.998 --> 08:53.100
Any new behavior?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.036
I don't know.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.707
To be honest,
Evan really didn't

08:59.740 --> 09:02.009
share much with us,
even when we asked him.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.179
Sometimes the three of us,
we'd be out for dinner,

09:06.213 --> 09:10.317
and I'd watch
the other families.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.653
They'd be talking
with their kids

09:12.686 --> 09:14.121
and laughing

09:14.154 --> 09:15.122
and sharing things.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.657
We never had that, ever,

09:16.690 --> 09:19.126
and I don't know why.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.329
Did Evan ever mention
something called

09:22.362 --> 09:24.632
the Ten Golden Steps?

09:24.665 --> 09:28.101
No.
What's that?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.673
We think someone
might have been

09:32.706 --> 09:34.341
communicating with Evan--

09:34.374 --> 09:37.778
that he was getting
instructions from someone.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.346
Instructions
for what?

09:39.379 --> 09:40.580
We don't know yet.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.684
Are you saying
someone told Evan

09:43.717 --> 09:45.085
to kill himself?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.954
Mr. Zymuski, we're
just trying to

09:46.987 --> 09:47.788
put the pieces
together.

09:50.057 --> 09:50.958
SARA: It would
help to figure out

09:50.991 --> 09:54.094
how someone contacted your son.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.630
I have no idea.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.069
I don't know if I ever really
knew anything about my son.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.374
Is this Evan's computer?

10:10.844 --> 10:13.113
Would it be all right
if we borrow this?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.348
I promise you that
we will get this back to you.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.650
Yeah.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.318
Thank you.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.021
WOMAN:
In my practice, I see

10:21.054 --> 10:23.156
a lot of teens who
struggle with depression

10:23.190 --> 10:25.258
and anxiety--
it's a difficult time.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.727
Teens are malleable.
They're wrestling

10:26.760 --> 10:27.828
with who they are
and who they want to be.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.429
Yeah, I remember that.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.198
Unfortunately,

10:31.231 --> 10:33.166
for some of them,
it's just too much.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.203
They may be looking
for a way out.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.405
These are the kids
that a game like this

10:38.438 --> 10:40.674
preys on.
Okay, because
they're susceptible.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.842
Exactly.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.744
You may have hundreds of kids

10:43.777 --> 10:45.412
exposed to the game,

10:45.445 --> 10:48.115
but only these vulnerable few
will go through with it.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.717
Look, well, what about
the guy behind it?

10:49.750 --> 10:51.284
What can you tell me about him?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.720
Hmm.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.289
Maybe a background of abuse,

10:56.323 --> 10:59.226
mental illness,
a victim of bullying.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.028
I wish I could give you
a profile,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.030
but it's just not that simple.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.065
Here's the real question:
what can Sophe do about it?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.334
I'm worried
that if we put it out there,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.169
I'm gonna be publicizing
the game,

11:09.202 --> 11:10.403
glorifying suicides.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.839
No. Highlighting suicide

11:11.872 --> 11:13.874
isn't going to inspire people

11:13.907 --> 11:15.308
to seek it out. That's a myth.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.178
Talking about suicide
and the permanence of it,

11:18.211 --> 11:21.749
raising awareness
in a positive way,

11:21.782 --> 11:24.051
that's one of the best
preventative things you can do.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.452
Great. Thank you so much.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.054
Listen, it's rare that I get

11:27.087 --> 11:28.488
to talk to a Sophe user
face-to-face,

11:28.521 --> 11:30.758
so this has been... Thank you.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.093
(chuckles)
Well, it's my pleasure.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.796
But, uh, how are you holding up,

11:35.829 --> 11:37.831
Mr. Tanner?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.167
Obviously, I know
what you've been through

11:40.200 --> 11:41.468
over the past year.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.104
Have you ever considered
talking to somebody?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.873
Well, yeah,
I did that for a while,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.908
and, uh, right now my-my work
is my therapy, so...

11:47.941 --> 11:49.743
(chuckles)

11:49.777 --> 11:51.411
That's a fairly common
mechanism of avoidance.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.180
That's me.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
I can avoid
with the best of them.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.917
Well, if you ever
need to talk,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.919
we could make this
a weekly thing.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.755
Oh. Yes, I will...
I will get back to you.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.091
Thank you so much. Tariq.

12:04.124 --> 12:04.925
Post it.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.202
(evidence alert blaring)

12:18.471 --> 12:21.508
That was fast.
I just told you to post it.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.510
No, it isn't about the suicides.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.278
It's about the sweater
in Mia's video.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.780
What about it?

12:26.814 --> 12:28.849
They're guessing the size

12:28.882 --> 12:30.383
by measuring it
relative to the door.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.185
Top vote-getter
is a men's extra large.

12:32.219 --> 12:35.488
That's way too big
for Carlos Ochoa.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.224
Users also combed through
the evidence logs

12:37.257 --> 12:39.159
and crime scene photos
from the trial.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.394
The sweater's not
in any of them.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.264
So it was in her apartment
the day before she was killed...

12:44.297 --> 12:45.398
But gone when the
police arrived.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.834
One more piece of evidence

12:46.867 --> 12:49.269
that says there was another guy.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.838
We find that sweater,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.906
we find Mia's killer.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.876
I can't imagine what
those parents are going through.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.412
To lose your kid like that.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.182
Just...

13:06.519 --> 13:09.289
Are you okay?

13:09.322 --> 13:12.192
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.562
(evidence alert beeping)

13:18.298 --> 13:20.901
It's from a high school teacher
in Broadmoor.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.203
A student there broke
her arm yesterday

13:23.236 --> 13:26.239
after trying to climb
the stadium scoreboard.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.375
When the paramedic
took her blood pressure,

13:28.408 --> 13:31.244
the teacher noticed that there
were scratch marks on her arm.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.913
Recent scratch marks.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.982
They were laid out
like tally marks.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.583
The same
as the other two victims.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.318
Exactly.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.253
(siren wailing)

13:51.031 --> 13:52.465
Do you mind if
I talk to her?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.301
Yeah.
Thank you.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.242
Hi, Zoe.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.513
I'm Sara.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.420
We...

14:13.453 --> 14:16.856
we need to talk to you
about what happened.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.430
I know why you were up
on that scoreboard.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.502
It's part of the
Ten Golden Steps,

14:29.536 --> 14:33.006
isn't it?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.574
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.476
The scoreboard thing,

14:36.509 --> 14:39.512
it was... it was a goof.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.482
That's all.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.651
A friend dared me to do it.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.486
(door opens)

14:46.519 --> 14:48.555
Tyler, get out.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.464
(door closes)

14:57.497 --> 14:59.466
I know what these
scratches are.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.969
It's just a game.
No, Zoe.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.036
It's not.
Okay, look,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.305
I just do it for the thrill.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.706
Or whatever. I...

15:06.739 --> 15:08.475
It doesn't mean anything.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.110
Do you know how this game ends?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.612
What you're doing

15:12.645 --> 15:14.614
is-is so stupid and selfish

15:14.647 --> 15:16.950
and-and cruel.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
You're not thinking
about anyone but yourself.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.954
You don't know
anything about me.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.655
I know exactly
who you are.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.690
I need to know

15:23.723 --> 15:25.525
how you access the game.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.493
I need to know how
you made contact

15:26.526 --> 15:27.560
with this man.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.962
Zoe, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.098
Zoe, Zoe...
Go away! I said I don't want

15:31.131 --> 15:33.100
to talk to you. Get off of me!
(overlapping chatter)

15:33.133 --> 15:34.567
Stop, everybody!
Please, get out.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.568
Please.
We're leaving,
we're leaving.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.037
That's enough.
So sorry.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.038
Please.
Ms. Sanford, we're leaving.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.572
She needs to know that you...

15:39.606 --> 15:41.074
that you love her
and that she's wanted

15:41.108 --> 15:43.410
and that she's not a burden.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.112
I don't know
how to make it better.
Yeah, I know.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.713
But just be more vigilant.
Take away her phone

15:46.746 --> 15:49.082
and her computer.
Keep tabs on her.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.117
Okay? Sh-she'll be mad,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.019
but she'll know that you care.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.454
Okay?
Sara, we are leaving now.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.123
Let's go.
Okay.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.125
CAVANAUGH:
Thank you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.129
Hey.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.496
Hey.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.466
Hey!

16:06.499 --> 16:08.168
Hey, you want to tell me
what happened in there?
I don't know.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.138
I am... I blew it.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.041
I'm sorry.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.743
(sighs) It's fine.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.146
I'll call Ruiz,
see if she can get a warrant

16:19.179 --> 16:21.448
for her laptop and her phone.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.116
Maybe we'll find
what we're looking for in there.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.621
What? What is it?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.490
That sticker.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.793
Evan Zymuski had the
same one on his laptop.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.562
Yeah, those are popping
up everywhere.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.431
All right? I saw one at
a pizza joint last night.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.500
Only this is not just a sticker.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.036
See? That's a QR code
hidden in the face.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.475
"Want to play a game?"

16:50.543 --> 16:52.045
(sighs)

16:58.851 --> 17:01.188
TARIQ:
"Want to play a game?"

17:01.221 --> 17:03.123
"What kind of game?"

17:03.156 --> 17:04.291
"One with purpose.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.826
One that will change your life."

17:06.859 --> 17:09.362
Do you think it's a
bot or a real person?
Let's find out.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.767
SARA:
"Are you worthy?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.836
Most people aren't."

17:16.869 --> 17:18.805
"I'm not like most people."

17:18.838 --> 17:21.774
"Then prove your mettle

17:21.808 --> 17:23.843
by completing
the Ten Golden Steps."

17:23.876 --> 17:25.445
"Mettle"?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.180
This guy's
going a little D&D on us.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.149
SARA: Easy, Tariq.
Don't push it.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.817
She's right.
We don't want to spook him.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.420
It is what we want
to know, right?
Yeah.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.823
CAVANAUGH: Oh. "I am
the Gamemaster.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.126
And the game is played
by my rules, not yours."
(laughs)

17:39.159 --> 17:40.827
All right, prick.
This guy's pissing me off.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.863
SARA:
Tariq!

17:43.896 --> 17:46.499
Oh.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.736
What the hell is wrong with you?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.738
What? We can just scan
another sticker

17:51.771 --> 17:53.473
and use a different IP.
He won't even know it's us.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.209
Except, thanks to you, he'll
now know someone's onto him.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.811
Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You are so much smarter
than everyone, aren't you?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.547
Why should you ever
have to listen?
Hey, take it easy.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.382
No! He treats everything...
Calm down.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.750
...like it's a game.
He's bloody irresponsible.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.585
Sara.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.188
Sara, what are you doing?
Do not talk to me

18:08.221 --> 18:09.322
right now, Jeffrey.
No, come on.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.590
I'm fine.
Sara, look.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.892
Hey, Sara. You just
yelled at Tariq

18:12.925 --> 18:14.261
in front of everyone,
all right?

18:14.294 --> 18:15.495
As if you've never
yelled at anyone.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.764
We've had
this conversation before.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.767
I discipline my staff
how I see fit.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.771
Look, we both know
this isn't about Tariq.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.873
(laughs)
All right? I'm...
Look at... Sara.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.508
I'm worried about you.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.410
Oh, my God, Jeffrey.
It was 15 years ago.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.346
I've dealt with it,
so just stop trying to fix me.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.249
I am not trying to fix you.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.485
You lost your brother.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.320
It actually...
No, I didn't lose my brother.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.555
He killed himself. Okay?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.391
It's part of who I am.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.359
Nothing's ever
gonna make that go away,

18:46.393 --> 18:47.627
and nothing's ever
gonna bring him back,

18:47.660 --> 18:49.929
anymore than Sophe
is going to bring back Mia.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.831
So just...

18:54.267 --> 18:55.935
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.870
No, no.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.906
Listen.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.610
Take all the time that you need.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.153
How fired am I?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.290
Let me put it this way:

19:17.324 --> 19:19.959
I wouldn't plan
any big purchases anytime soon.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.429
Yeah.
All right, but you need
to snap out of it.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.463
All right, what about
hacking this guy?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
Can we find him that way?
No way.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.567
The whole point of ChumHum Vault
is the anonymity.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.403
Without his phone,
the encryption is bulletproof.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.206
Even for me.
The stickers.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.209
They're the key to
finding this guy.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.911
They popped up all over the city
pretty fast, right?
Almost overnight.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.581
I mean, one day I was driving
to work and they're everywhere.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.317
I mean, on buildings,
lampposts, shop windows.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.219
Why?
What are you thinking, mathlete?

19:46.253 --> 19:48.588
It's a long shot, but I could do
a distribution pattern analysis.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.956
If this guy went out

19:49.989 --> 19:51.324
and plastered these
all over town,

19:51.358 --> 19:52.592
the location
of these stickers

19:52.625 --> 19:53.893
could tell us
roughly where he's based.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.428
We just need to map out
where they are.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.696
Okay. How do you do that?

19:56.729 --> 19:57.897
Really, Columbo?

19:57.930 --> 19:59.332
Sophe. Sophe.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.600
We get users to photograph them,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.435
then use the geotag info
to map them out.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.670
And then I find this guy.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.004
All right, well,
let's do this.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.939
All right.
Come on. Sounds good.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.455
Hey, what can I get for you?
Hey. You got a sticker

20:22.489 --> 20:24.691
like this in your window.
Any idea who put it there?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.293
Couldn't tell you.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.994
People post crap
in here all the time.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.696
If you want one,

20:29.729 --> 20:31.464
I think we've got a stack
of them over there.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.018
Something
isn't working.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.321
I-I assumed a somewhat
random distribution, right?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.356
Guy has hundreds
of stickers to get rid of.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.391
He runs around,
he puts them up everywhere.
But the distribution

20:58.425 --> 21:00.493
isn't random-- the array
is clustered, right?

21:00.527 --> 21:01.628
Because he targeted
specific spots.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.929
You know, schools,
record stores,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.364
pizza places...

21:04.397 --> 21:06.499
Places teenagers
hang out.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.067
Well, still,
I can account for that

21:08.100 --> 21:10.303
using geographic profiling
and probability theory,

21:10.337 --> 21:12.439
I should still be able
to pinpoint his hot spot.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.407
I don't get it.
And you're not gonna.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.775
Cavanaugh.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.644
Whoever this guy is,
he left a whole stack

21:17.677 --> 21:19.579
of stickers at the pizza place,
probably other places, too,

21:19.612 --> 21:20.413
which means
kids grab them,

21:20.447 --> 21:21.414
carry them around,

21:21.448 --> 21:22.782
and stick them up other places.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.317
Well, there
goes any hope

21:24.351 --> 21:25.418
of deducing his location.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.553
Whoever our
Gamemaster is,

21:26.586 --> 21:28.655
he's clever, or maybe lazy.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.089
Either way...
Damn it,

21:30.122 --> 21:31.524
I-I should
have seen it.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.425
The sticker on
Evan's laptop,

21:32.459 --> 21:33.960
the one on
Zoe's car.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.396
I... I just need to
make some adjustments.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.364
If I, if I change the
cumulative density function

21:37.397 --> 21:38.798
from sum to integral,

21:38.831 --> 21:40.800
that'll redefine
the variate...
Dude.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.636
Going all Rain Man on me
isn't gonna do it.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.806
It's just not gonna work.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.552
(game chiming and clanking)

22:06.493 --> 22:08.595
Listen, man,
we're gonna find him.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.030
It's just gonna take
a little longer.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.133
That's all.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.503
(clanking and chiming continue)

22:22.041 --> 22:24.577
You know what I was doing
before I started here?

22:24.611 --> 22:26.646
Sitting in my
parents' basement,

22:26.679 --> 22:28.748
grey-hatting
corporate databases

22:28.781 --> 22:31.518
and screwing with
frog meme-ers all day.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.055
Then I heard what
Tanner was doing,

22:36.088 --> 22:38.391
and I figured, "Hell,
I could do that."

22:38.425 --> 22:41.528
So I hacked my
way into a job.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.763
But I still can't
compete with you.

22:43.796 --> 22:47.867
(loud clacking)

22:47.900 --> 22:49.702
So I cover with attitude.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.771
(sighs)
Look how well

22:51.804 --> 22:53.506
that worked
out today.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.174
But you...

22:55.207 --> 22:56.709
You've got the
mad math skills

22:56.743 --> 22:58.645
and the degrees and
the discipline.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.548
And I'm only gonna say this
once, so pay attention.

23:01.581 --> 23:02.882
You're pretty
much the man.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.086
I could have been
one of these kids.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.188
When I was that age,

23:09.221 --> 23:10.823
I had no friends.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.659
My brother and sister were
grown and out of the house.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.193
My parents were divorced.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.563
I was alone and isolated.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.668
This game is targeting kids
just like me.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.836
Josh, seriously, you're giving
this creep way too much credit.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.539
He's a troll, that's all.

23:26.573 --> 23:30.076
Even in San Francisco,
growing up a

23:30.109 --> 23:33.079
crazy-handsome brown kid,
I got bullied non-stop.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.082
And it sucked,
but I survived.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.084
And you survived.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.786
And these kids
will survive, too.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.554
We just got to...

23:41.588 --> 23:43.456
We just got to
get this loser.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.824
(sniffles)

23:44.857 --> 23:47.827
(evidence alert beeping)

23:53.600 --> 23:55.167
There you are.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.104
I just got a direct message
to my internal channel.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.872
Some user

23:59.906 --> 24:01.608
claiming that
he saw the post

24:01.641 --> 24:03.142
about the stickers
and wants to help.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.244
Wait. How is a user accessing
our internal channel?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.246
His IP's bouncing
all over the place--

24:07.279 --> 24:09.148
Idaho, Namibia, Fiji.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.917
This is black-ops stuff.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.585
Okay. What do you want to do?

24:12.619 --> 24:13.853
Open up a
video channel.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.489
Yeah.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.493
(trilling, static)

24:24.631 --> 24:27.166
Um... hello?

24:27.199 --> 24:28.935
Thanks for pinging me back.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.236
TARIQ:
What is this,
Deep Throat?

24:30.269 --> 24:31.604
This is Cigarette-Smoking Man.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.139
My guess is NSA.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.741
Am I right?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.909
Sophe has friends everywhere,
Mr. Tanner.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.145
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.
Except we can't see your mouth.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.947
You could be talking
out of your...

24:40.980 --> 24:42.281
You said you could help us
track down the stickers. How?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.950
You'll need

24:43.983 --> 24:46.185
to send me a high-resolution
scan of one of them.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.888
Well...
I'm on it.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.189
SARA:
Well, what good
would that do you?

24:50.222 --> 24:51.991
Set.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.161
Since the '90s, all U.S.
printers are built to record

24:55.194 --> 24:56.963
tiny, invisible marks
on every page.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.298
The marks enable us to pinpoint
the origin of a document.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.000
You're talking
about microdots.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.770
Sounds like Big Brother's
big brother to me.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.938
The point was to hedge against
currency counterfeiting.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.808
The marks are only visible under
a narrow spectrum of light.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.243
But when you strip out
the proper color bands...

25:11.277 --> 25:13.546
So do we know
where they were printed?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.982
For that, you need a key,
or a friend who has one.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.817
I'll get back to you.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.688
(scoffs)
Okay.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.756
This is either the most
exciting, or most terrifying day

25:23.790 --> 25:25.592
of my entire life.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.998
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.266
Hey.
Sophe was able

25:34.300 --> 25:35.868
to track down
the stickers.
Okay.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.771
It was ordered online
from a print shop in Maine,

25:38.805 --> 25:40.707
mailed to some guy
named Jason Forde.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.208
This is the address.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.610
Unit B. He rents
the back house.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.812
We need to talk
to you, Jason.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.782
RUIZ:
Put your hands

25:49.816 --> 25:51.584
where I can
see them!
Hey! Hey!

25:51.618 --> 25:53.586
Drop it.
Hands. Where I can
see them.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.688
Damn it, let's go.
Drop it!

25:55.722 --> 25:59.358
Drop it! (sighs)

25:59.391 --> 26:01.060
What do you
got? What?
It's locked.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.663
What'd you do?
What did you just do?

26:03.696 --> 26:04.864
Oops. (laughs)

26:04.897 --> 26:07.600
Too late.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.943
(door opens)

26:16.976 --> 26:18.811
Hey.
Hi.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.282
That's him?

26:23.315 --> 26:25.985
He just looks
so normal.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.720
You do this long enough,

26:27.754 --> 26:31.157
your expectations
of normal all fade away.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.125
All I got is hope
that somebody like this

26:33.159 --> 26:35.695
never comes
within a mile of my kid.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.930
I thought you didn't have kids.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.700
No, I said I wouldn't
talk about it.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.905
(sighs)

26:45.938 --> 26:48.908
He's 14, he lives
in L.A. with my ex.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.043
Hmm.

26:51.077 --> 26:54.013
So this one's got
to be tough for you.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.015
(door opens)
Well...

26:56.048 --> 26:57.316
It's in the works.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.819
All right.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.021
I'll be back.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.958
And to answer
your question,

27:05.992 --> 27:08.327
yes, it's tougher
than most.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.144
You don't seem too concerned
with your situation there,

27:25.177 --> 27:27.079
Jason.

27:27.113 --> 27:30.116
No visionary is ever
accepted at first.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.819
I read that... somewhere.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.253
CAVANAUGH:
A visionary, huh?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.889
So is that what that is?

27:36.923 --> 27:38.190
Is that your vision?

27:38.224 --> 27:39.992
You like?

27:40.026 --> 27:43.830
It's a...
It's an art project of mine.

27:43.863 --> 27:48.167
Viral campaigns are
a big thing, you know?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.937
What about what happens to
the kids who scan those things?

27:50.970 --> 27:55.374
Nothing much happens
to most of them.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.845
As for the rest... I mean,

27:58.878 --> 28:02.014
I feel terrible if
anybody gets hurt, but

28:02.048 --> 28:05.384
all in all, it seems
like a net positive, no?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.887
RUIZ:
How do you figure?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.889
Well, there's too many
people on the planet

28:09.922 --> 28:11.758
as it is.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.893
Most of them are
too stupid or weak to make

28:13.926 --> 28:17.196
any sort of real contribution,
so, why complain

28:17.229 --> 28:19.899
if the runts of the litter
decide to call it quits?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.801
And the Ten Golden Steps,

28:21.834 --> 28:25.404
that's your way of helping
the runts along, right?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.307
Like I said,
it's a... an art project.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.009
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.811
JASON: All I did was
put up some stickers.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.046
Which, at worst,
could be

28:34.080 --> 28:36.015
a 594, destruction
of property charge,

28:36.048 --> 28:37.316
or more likely, a misdemeanor.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.418
Littering citation.

28:39.451 --> 28:43.222
You know how liberal
this city is with its artists.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.390
(knocking on door)

28:44.423 --> 28:46.258
(door opens)

28:46.292 --> 28:47.960
OFFICER:
Here you go, sir.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.195
Thank you.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.063
Yes, I do.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.965
(door closes)

28:56.202 --> 28:58.337
RUIZ: So you probably know
about penal code 401.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.073
Assisted suicide, sure.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.075
But if people choose,
of their own free will,

29:03.109 --> 29:06.212
to end their life, again,
that's not on me.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.413
Unless you encourage them.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.248
Then it becomes a felony.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.217
(chuckles)

29:11.250 --> 29:12.919
Look, here's the thing. Um...

29:12.952 --> 29:14.186
(clears throat)

29:14.220 --> 29:15.988
Not that you'd find
anything on it,

29:16.022 --> 29:17.389
but even with a warrant,

29:17.423 --> 29:20.059
you can't compel me
to give up the password

29:20.092 --> 29:22.361
to open my phone.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.130
I know my rights.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.331
CAVANAUGH:
You do.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.200
Except,

29:28.234 --> 29:31.437
your lazy ass uses biometrics.

29:31.470 --> 29:36.108
And this warrant says that we

29:36.142 --> 29:38.477
can compel your fingerprint
to open it.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.313
(scoffs)

29:41.347 --> 29:43.382
So you see, Jason,

29:43.415 --> 29:46.385
we can do this the easy way,

29:46.418 --> 29:48.888
or the hard.

29:50.923 --> 29:54.026
And I'm leaning
toward the latter.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.067
(phone beeps)

30:02.301 --> 30:04.236
Phone's unlocked. Go.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.006
Got to admit, this is
virgin territory for me.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.507
Hacking under a warrant.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.109
You guys think I can get
a framed copy or something?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.377
Come on. Focus up,
Tariq. Come on.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.112
TARIQ:
All right, all right.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.146
Bad news is that
the Tenth Step was sent

30:14.180 --> 30:15.214
to three different players.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.884
The good news is,
I got usernames on all three.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.318
Josh, I'm gonna send them
to you, so maybe

30:19.351 --> 30:21.220
you can link up some numbers?
Yeah. I'll start scouring

30:21.253 --> 30:23.022
social media,
see what I can find.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.157
I'll start a thread,
and get some user help.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.526
These kids already have
a head start on us.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.096
Here we go. I've got one.
I've got a mobile number.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.031
Tariq, take it
while I work on number two?

30:32.064 --> 30:32.865
All right, I'll do
a little magic, see if I can

30:32.899 --> 30:35.201
pinpoint a GPS.
We got cars on alert.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.003
Just waiting on your word.
I've got an ID on Creeper.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.273
The kid's only 14.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.508
First one's
on Fell near Buchanan.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.276
I'll let dispatch know.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.544
And the second one is Creeper,

30:45.577 --> 30:48.214
who's on Claymore, by Mullen.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.249
SARA:
That matches his home address.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.383
Maybe he hasn't
left the house yet.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.052
I'll take that one.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.053
All right, what about
the third one?

30:54.086 --> 30:55.154
Where is he?

30:55.187 --> 30:56.222
JOSH:
Um...

30:56.255 --> 30:57.523
We've got a problem.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.958
You can't locate the third kid?

30:58.991 --> 31:00.326
No, I found him.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
But according to his GPS,
he's in Portland.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.462
TANNER:
Portland?

31:03.495 --> 31:05.164
What does-what does that mean?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.465
Does it mean
that the game has spread?

31:06.498 --> 31:08.334
I don't think so. I'm
on his ChumHum page.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.070
He visited San Francisco
last week.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.939
RUIZ:
I'll reach out to Portland PD,

31:12.972 --> 31:14.473
but it's gonna take some time.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.208
(line ringing)

31:16.242 --> 31:18.978
(phone ringing, vibrating)

31:20.579 --> 31:22.081
(phone beeps)

31:22.114 --> 31:23.215
(sniffles)

31:23.249 --> 31:24.984
Who is this?

31:25.017 --> 31:26.452
JOSH:
Dylan. My-my name's Josh.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.355
Look, you don't know me,
but I-I know what you're doing.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.489
I know about the game.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.192
I can't do it.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.495
I want to, but I can't.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.365
I'm just too scared.
No. That-that-that's good.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.200
That's good that you can't
do it. I don't want you to.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.569
(crying):
But I have to complete the game.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.471
I can't fail at this, too.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.073
No. No, listen to me.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.108
You only fail
if you follow through.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.210
The-the guy behind this,
he's a bully.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.445
He-he wants you to hurt
yourself. You can't let him win.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.247
Do you hear me?
(Dylan crying)

31:55.281 --> 31:59.118
Look, I-I have a friend calling
the police right now.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.987
Just promise me
you'll wait for them, okay?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.089
No, you don't understand.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.390
The first two are safe.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.224
What about Portland?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.296
Look, I-I can't pretend
to know exactly

32:10.329 --> 32:13.265
what you're going through,
but...

32:13.299 --> 32:15.501
I do know what it's like
to feel different.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.270
You know, to-to not belong.

32:18.304 --> 32:22.608
And-and not to go all
after-school-special on you,

32:22.641 --> 32:26.245
but it does get better.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.080
(siren wailing in distance)

32:29.281 --> 32:32.284
They're here.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.520
I should go.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.255
This is my number, okay?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.456
Use it.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.628
TARIQ: Nice one, Josh.
Just like we called it.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.463
Score another for the good guys,
I guess.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.532
Uh, guys?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.134
I was digging a little
deeper in the chat logs

32:48.167 --> 32:49.601
to look for players
at lower levels.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.303
And?

32:51.337 --> 32:53.505
He sent out a Step Ten
to another user...

32:53.539 --> 32:55.674
two days ago.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.611
(phone rings)

33:05.517 --> 33:08.287
Zoe's lost her phone privileges.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.322
You're gonna have to talk
to her at school.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.059
Oh, Detective?

33:13.092 --> 33:16.562
Well, I just checked on her
ten minutes ago.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.563
Zoe?

33:19.265 --> 33:20.366
Zoe.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.507
(insects trilling outside)

33:29.575 --> 33:32.178
Oh, no.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.653
I guess it's time.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.274
Her mother says her car's
still in the driveway,

34:02.308 --> 34:03.675
so she can't have gone far.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.478
I've got a thread up.
Anything?

34:06.512 --> 34:09.315
The neighbors are searching
nearby, and it's up on Sophe.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.251
Listen, what about
tracking her cell phone?
She doesn't have it.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.220
Her mother took it away from
her, like I told her to.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.188
Look, the-the rules of the game
are she's supposed

34:16.222 --> 34:17.489
to record herself.
Right, which is why

34:17.523 --> 34:19.358
she's taken her
mother's camera instead.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.293
Cops have as many cars
out there as they can.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.195
No. We've got far more eyes
with Sophe.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.700
*

34:34.773 --> 34:36.442
(car beeps)

34:36.475 --> 34:37.576
Let's go home.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.710
Is-is that her?

34:40.446 --> 34:41.713
I think so.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.815
Message them.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.225
Let's go.
Come on.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.295
Someone spotted her.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.729
A parking garage
on Lafayette.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.332
Put it out.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.800
I'm gonna call Cavanaugh.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.670
I'll start a thread
with Sophe users.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.641
Zoe!

35:11.610 --> 35:12.744
ZOE:
Who... ?

35:12.778 --> 35:14.413
We're here to help.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.748
ZOE: What is this?
Just get away from me.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.550
She's panicking.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.319
Someone needs
to calm her down.
You know what?

35:20.352 --> 35:21.420
Connect us with one
of the Sophe users

35:21.453 --> 35:23.422
in that area and
put him on a video chat.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.723
On it.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.226
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

35:27.259 --> 35:29.561
(phone ringing)

35:31.430 --> 35:33.432
Steve, it's Josh from Sophe.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.666
We need you to take
your phone to Zoe.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.268
Okay.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.737
Give me a second.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.839
JOSH:
He's getting it to her.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.678
Go on.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.653
ZOE:
J-Just get away from me.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.888
Just, please.
I have to do this.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.524
They want to talk to you.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.725
Zoe, do you remember me?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.829
Zoe, it's Sara.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.797
I-I was at your house.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.899
Do you remember me?

36:07.933 --> 36:10.569
Please.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.671
Please, just tell these people
to leave me alone.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.506
Zoe, I need you
to listen to me.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.542
ZOE:
No. I told you,

36:16.575 --> 36:18.344
you don't understand.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.512
No. I-I do understand.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.747
Zoe...

36:23.682 --> 36:25.651
I had a brother called Patrick,

36:25.684 --> 36:28.820
who killed himself
when he was your age.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.824
And my whole life,
I've told people that...

36:32.858 --> 36:35.727
that I felt guilty,
as if it was

36:35.761 --> 36:38.597
somehow my fault,

36:38.630 --> 36:41.867
but you know
what I've just realized?

36:41.900 --> 36:45.771
It's not, it's not guilt
that I feel.

36:47.639 --> 36:50.409
It's anger.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.578
I'm so angry at him.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.913
He abandoned me.

36:54.946 --> 36:59.451
He robbed me of my big brother.

36:59.485 --> 37:03.955
Took memories that we
were meant to have together.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.458
Is that what you want to do
to your brother?

37:06.492 --> 37:09.561
To Tyler?

37:09.595 --> 37:12.331
He needs you,

37:12.364 --> 37:13.932
he really does.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.801
Look around you,
we all do.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.805
Look at all these people
on a rooftop

37:19.838 --> 37:22.374
in the middle of the night
because of you.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.477
You have this...

37:25.511 --> 37:28.847
huge choice.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.783
Are you going to steal
from them?

37:31.817 --> 37:34.620
From-from Tyler,
from your family?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.555
Take away memories

37:36.588 --> 37:39.825
that they deserve to have?

37:42.027 --> 37:44.663
You hurt, I know.

37:44.696 --> 37:48.534
Worse than anyone can imagine,

37:48.567 --> 37:51.603
but this is not the way.

37:51.637 --> 37:55.774
So let us help you.

38:01.046 --> 38:03.515
Yeah, we're just
getting to the roof.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.016
She's coming down.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.618
Zoe!

38:06.652 --> 38:08.454
Mom.
Zoe! No, baby!

38:08.487 --> 38:11.457
(crying):
No, no. No.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.760
Zoe. Oh, my baby.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.828
(Karen crying)

38:16.862 --> 38:18.830
(exhales)

38:21.900 --> 38:24.002
(sniffles)
Are you okay?

38:24.035 --> 38:26.037
Yeah.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.507
(crying): She's gonna
need so much help.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.543
No. You're incredible.

38:31.577 --> 38:32.611
(laughs)
You know that?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.012
I've heard tell, yes.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.665
My mother told me
to never take delight

38:53.699 --> 38:55.701
in the misfortune of others.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.035
Well, this one time
I think she'd allow it.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.571
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.973
I'm taking
a couple days off.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.810
Going down to L.A.,
pick up my son for a visit.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.945
Well, I think
that's a good idea.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.883
(both moaning)

39:11.917 --> 39:14.052
Have I mentioned
how sorry I am?

39:14.085 --> 39:15.487
Really? Good.

39:15.521 --> 39:15.987
(grunts)

39:18.490 --> 39:21.560
(evidence alert beeping)

39:21.593 --> 39:22.594
You know what, let it go.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.029
No.
Just let it go.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.497
No, it doesn't matter.
There is literally

39:25.531 --> 39:27.999
no version of what
I'm about to do to you

39:28.033 --> 39:29.801
that is made better

39:29.835 --> 39:31.670
by you being distracted.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.978
They've sourced the sweater.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.614
It's an exclusive European label

39:42.648 --> 39:43.882
available only
at a single boutique.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.117
TANNER:
$550.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.120
Rich people,
am I right?
Yeah.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.823
Under a thousand sweaters
manufactured.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.559
It's a start.
Yeah.

39:53.592 --> 39:54.660
Post it.
