01:03.897 --> 01:06.634
I dropped her off at school
that morning like I always do,

01:07.635 --> 01:11.539
and expected to pick her up
about 5:30 from track practice.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.811
She snuck out of the house with

01:15.813 --> 01:18.447
her friends to a back-to-school party.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.482
They ended up at a Hardees

01:21.582 --> 01:24.485
not too far from where I was living.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.189
Later that afternoon,

01:28.556 --> 01:32.526
about four o'clock, I got a phone call
from one of her friends,

01:33.261 --> 01:35.863
and he said that he had a note for me,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.799
telling us that she loved us

01:38.932 --> 01:41.802
and she needed to leave
and go find herself.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.438
One went back home,

01:44.538 --> 01:48.209
the other young lady got into
a car with several men,

01:48.309 --> 01:52.213
and M.A. did not want
to get into that car.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.284
And that is when a woman approached her,

01:56.784 --> 01:59.853
told her that she was going
to help her to get back home.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.758
And what she did was she...

02:05.659 --> 02:08.862
Brought her into a life of hell.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.402
Kubiiki's daughter, M.A., who is 13,

02:14.568 --> 02:17.371
and Nacole's daughter, J.S., who is 15,

02:18.206 --> 02:20.708
are now among the 1.6 million homeless

02:20.808 --> 02:22.476
and runaway children in America.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.780
Within hours of dropping off the radar,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.250
thousands of them
will be sex trafficked.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.220
A polite term for
being repeatedly raped.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.325
This is the story of
the girls and their parents,

02:37.425 --> 02:39.793
and their fight against
a legal and political system

02:39.893 --> 02:42.763
which protects a website earning
millions of dollars a year.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.167
A website where children
are bought and sold,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.170
with little more than
a click of a mouse.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.541
It was the third link from the top.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.977
It had stars and hearts.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.946
And it said, "Young and new."

03:33.347 --> 03:36.384
But those stars and the hearts
caught my attention.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.420
And so I clicked it and...

03:40.621 --> 03:42.823
There was the pictures of my daughter.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.564
I called and asked to purchase
the services myself.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.302
We got her back,
but she was addicted to drugs.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.836
She had been very abused.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.238
She ran away two more times.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.474
I said, "Why are you running away?"

04:00.574 --> 04:03.577
And she said, "Well, mom,
I have to go and get these pills."

04:03.677 --> 04:04.845
And I'm like, "What pills?"

04:06.013 --> 04:07.881
And that's when I learned
about the other things that,

04:07.981 --> 04:10.017
you know, that she had shot her...

04:16.589 --> 04:17.757
Next thing you know, boom.

04:19.927 --> 04:23.030
My daughter was stabbed and burned,

04:23.130 --> 04:25.265
and her head shaved,

04:25.366 --> 04:26.767
and she was beaten.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.703
The trafficker was prosecuted.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.572
She was given a five-year sentence.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.575
She was held responsible
for her part of the crime.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.410
Once I told her

04:37.745 --> 04:38.612
about all the pain and suffering
that I went through

04:39.547 --> 04:41.382
and that I wanted revenge, she also did.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.712
For the company that assisted by

04:44.714 --> 04:46.888
advertising my 13-year-old
child for sale,

04:46.987 --> 04:48.789
they were not held responsible.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.392
Backpage.com.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.836
We used it for buying and selling
couches, TVs, video games.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.038
I just never knew

05:05.773 --> 05:08.041
that there were also humans for sale.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.884
Kubiiki then calls Backpage.com.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.819
She calls them repeatedly,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.456
asking them to remove the pictures
of her 13-year-old daughter,

05:22.590 --> 05:24.392
which still remain online.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.093
They refuse.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.398
This sets Kubiiki on a collision
course with Federal Judges,

05:30.631 --> 05:33.066
special interest groups,
and corporate money,

05:33.767 --> 05:36.537
all clinging to a law which
has been interpreted

05:36.637 --> 05:39.106
to provide a safe haven
for many things online,

05:40.140 --> 05:43.110
including the purchase
and sale of children.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.914
Because her daughter's photos
are still online,

05:47.014 --> 05:50.618
Kubiiki then takes direct aim
at Backpage.com.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.758
Pedroli and Gauthier,
how may I help you?

05:58.191 --> 06:01.028
I believe we were
the first people to sue Backpage

06:01.128 --> 06:03.697
on behalf of a trafficked minor.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.601
I was thinking that
everyone that played a part

06:07.701 --> 06:10.404
in the damage to my child
should be held responsible.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.805
And that meant everyone.

06:21.615 --> 06:25.653
We would find pornographic
pictures of sexual acts,

06:25.753 --> 06:27.755
and it was all open and obvious.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.790
It doesn't take much common sense

06:29.890 --> 06:31.792
to figure out what the deal really is.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.533
That number is just
the tip of the iceberg.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.702
It is a crime that happens
against children

06:41.802 --> 06:44.838
in every neighborhood, in every
city and state in the country.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.641
I think I was like anybody else that
hears about it for the first time.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.876
There's that disbelief.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.979
There is no possible way this is true,

06:52.079 --> 06:53.847
because this is the United States.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.983
It's an incredibly profitable,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.486
as horrifying as it is to say, business.

06:58.886 --> 06:59.887
Here are the economics.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.490
You're a drug trafficker,
you can sell drugs once.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.857
You're a human trafficker,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.094
you can sell a kid
over and over and over again.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.931
A lot of the data on underage
trafficking is very difficult.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.833
And there's numbers all over the place.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.002
We think it's around the 100,000 mark.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.571
Twelve to fifteen percent
of the kids we serve

07:17.871 --> 07:19.607
were victims of human trafficking.

07:19.707 --> 07:23.677
There are estimates out there
that 1.6 million homeless kids

07:23.777 --> 07:25.212
are out on the street at any given time.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.148
You could be talking
about 100, 150,000 kids

07:28.248 --> 07:30.484
who have been victims
of human trafficking.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.687
Our kids are not visible.
The number could be even higher.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.558
These children, who were
once visible on street corners,

07:37.725 --> 07:41.829
are now quickly, efficiently,
and anonymously sold online.

07:42.029 --> 07:45.566
Wherever you look, however you slice it,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.935
the numbers are huge.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.570
And the demand is huge.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.740
The majority of children
that we see trafficked online

07:52.840 --> 07:54.675
have been trafficked on Backpage.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.218
Across the country in Seattle,
at roughly the same time,

08:05.853 --> 08:09.623
Nacole is desperately trying to
locate her own daughter, J.S.,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.525
who is 15 years old.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.196
Forty-five days into it,
I got a phone call from her.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.065
It was my birthday.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.669
She called to tell me that she loved me.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.371
It's kind of a blur.
I was just...

08:25.873 --> 08:28.141
in shock. I just couldn't
believe what was happening.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.945
My first instinct as a dad,
you want to go out and look.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.782
You feel out of control.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.118
Hopeless.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.988
I went out and started
searching every day.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.924
I was becoming angrier and angrier.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.961
I couldn't stop the tapes
in my mind, the...

08:48.228 --> 08:52.132
I couldn't stop thinking about what
was possibly happening to her.

08:52.833 --> 08:57.137
I was really frightened for her
and I was determined to find her.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.710
She told us that she was being hurt,

09:02.876 --> 09:04.177
that she wasn't a good daughter,

09:04.277 --> 09:05.746
she wasn't a good person,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.649
and that we wouldn't want her.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.619
You don't know whether
she's alive or dead,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.553
you don't know what's happened to her.

09:13.821 --> 09:17.257
I went to every bad
neighborhood and I went to motels.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.793
I canvassed where I thought
they could have her.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.595
It was really hard.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.333
I remember a detective called
sometime after the 45-day mark

09:26.767 --> 09:28.168
and asked for dental records,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.203
and you can only assume

09:31.772 --> 09:33.807
that they're trying to identify a body.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.846
Every day that it went on,
I just got more angry.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.248
Then I went to the liquor store

09:41.348 --> 09:43.684
I grabbed a bottle,
and I started drinking.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.919
And that's how I dealt with it.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.757
She started advocating,
and doing advocacy work.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.824
And praying.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.292
I was the opposite.
I was angry.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.728
I wanted to hurt a pimp.
That's what I wanted to do.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.796
I wanted to get even.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.076
In September of 2010,

10:09.176 --> 10:11.311
several months after filing the lawsuit,

10:11.945 --> 10:14.247
Kubiiki's attorney, Robert Pedroli,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.817
receives a phone call
from Village Voice Media,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.619
the parent company of Backpage.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.623
They contacted me to feel me out,

10:23.724 --> 10:27.027
and to tell me what
wonderful people they were,

10:27.127 --> 10:31.164
and how their founders were really
cool guys from Greenwich Village,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.033
and what did I know about that.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.402
The conversation swings around
to, you know,

10:35.502 --> 10:37.805
"What are you guys looking for?
You looking for a little settlement?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.873
"We might be able
to get you a little settlement

10:39.973 --> 10:41.174
to help the girl out."

10:42.309 --> 10:44.644
And I told him, "I doubt that
that would work."

10:45.846 --> 10:49.917
It wasn't about the money,
it was just about the anger.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.286
At that point in time,
they issued a press release

10:53.386 --> 10:56.423
talking about how we're
just looking for a payday.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.059
That was not what we were looking for.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.830
We were looking to prevent them
from doing what they were doing

11:02.996 --> 11:05.332
by having a judgment
rendered against them.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.092
I didn't even recognize her.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.261
She had long, beautiful brown hair

11:34.361 --> 11:37.765
and now she had very short,
choppy red hair.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.132
She had different clothes on.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.803
On the ride home she told us that
she had been raped and sold.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.139
As bad as it was having her missing,

11:46.339 --> 11:49.009
it was so traumatizing
to hear these words coming

11:49.109 --> 11:50.911
from your 15-year-old child.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.245
It was devastating.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.783
It took me a long time to realize

11:55.883 --> 11:58.752
that I wasn't at fault
for what happened to me.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.823
I don't think everybody
goes through life thinking

12:02.923 --> 12:04.958
about child sex trafficking
in the United States.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.829
I know for me I didn't, not
until it happened to my family.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.999
I always believed it was something
that happened in foreign countries.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.901
You hear about it on the news.

12:14.001 --> 12:17.237
But to find out that it
happened in my own backyard

12:17.404 --> 12:20.507
and that it can happen
to the most normal of families

12:20.607 --> 12:22.309
and the most normal of children,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.111
and how quickly it could happen.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.947
That's when I decided
to take up the fight

12:27.047 --> 12:30.851
and to pursue trying
to shut down Backpage.com.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.921
I am on a mission.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.892
The most popular Internet site for
escorts is called Backpage.com.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.928
And in recent weeks, we've
reported on growing pressure

12:41.028 --> 12:43.797
by law enforcement officials
and anti-sex trafficking groups

12:43.897 --> 12:46.967
for Backpage to shut down
its adult services section,

12:47.067 --> 12:48.986
the section where
authorities say underage

12:48.987 --> 12:50.503
girls are sometimes sold for sex.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.210
In October of 2010,
Craigslist shuts down its adult section

12:57.978 --> 13:00.881
and the number of sex ads
on Backpage skyrockets.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.851
Backpage offers to meet

13:05.285 --> 13:06.386
with the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children,

13:06.486 --> 13:07.855
or NCMEC,

13:08.956 --> 13:10.824
to discuss the issue
of child sex trafficking.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.827
Well, there was a period of years

13:15.028 --> 13:16.997
where NCMEC representatives
and Backpage representatives

13:17.097 --> 13:18.198
met fairly frequently.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.501
We wanted to suggest ways
that they can improve the site

13:21.601 --> 13:23.336
and try to get rid of trafficking.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.273
Backpage would always
ask us what more they could do,

13:27.707 --> 13:30.043
was always in discussions
exploring those options with us.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.313
One of Backpage's solutions
was to hire moderators.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.450
Their plan was to review
every sex ad, every adult ad,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.087
to screen for potential illegality.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.423
We had a list of words that we went by

13:43.556 --> 13:45.525
that were not supposed
to be used in the ads.

13:51.031 --> 13:54.534
The moderation rules and banned
term list changed often.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.508
On an average eight-hour day,

14:01.608 --> 14:04.511
I would go through seven
to eight hundred ads.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.381
A lot of times, I felt like we were
flying by the seat of our pants.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.188
In St. Louis,

14:16.323 --> 14:18.325
Kubiiki's case against Backpage
is finally decided,

14:18.591 --> 14:21.328
eighteen months
after it was first filed.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.432
Backpage argued that Kubiiki's
case should be dismissed

14:25.532 --> 14:29.937
under Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act, or CDA,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.573
a law which was enacted
by Congress in 1996.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.644
The CDA, put in place when the
Internet was just beginning,

14:37.744 --> 14:40.280
protects websites
from being sued for content

14:40.380 --> 14:42.215
that third parties might post.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.054
Some courts have ruled that this
immunity also covers illegal content.

14:48.121 --> 14:53.226
I was well aware of the immunity
created by Congressunder Section 230,

14:53.426 --> 14:57.965
although it had not been applied
against sexual trafficking cases.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.501
The law simply says,
as a website operator,

15:01.601 --> 15:04.471
I am not responsible as the publisher

15:04.571 --> 15:07.240
of what people are putting up
on my website.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.444
We argued, even if that's true,
we're not suing you

15:11.544 --> 15:14.681
solely as a publisher
or developer of that content.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.350
We're suing you because you've created

15:17.450 --> 15:20.387
this highly-focused, honed website

15:20.487 --> 15:23.623
that facilitates prostitution.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.494
We thought anybody can understand this.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.097
We lost the case,

15:30.197 --> 15:34.401
and it was because of
the Communication Decency Act.

15:35.068 --> 15:39.572
The judge determined that it was
the policy of the United States

15:39.672 --> 15:43.176
to allow for the unfettered
growth of the Internet.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.212
She was torn up.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.661
At the same time Backpage
wins its case in St. Louis,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.597
Nacole takes steps
to file her own lawsuit

16:04.697 --> 16:06.399
against Backpage in Seattle.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.604
I knew that there had been
a trial out of Missouri,

16:11.704 --> 16:14.274
so my first thought was
to contact that attorney

16:14.374 --> 16:17.310
and see how it was going over there.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.346
He wasn't going to appeal the case.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.115
He said that I should try to
contact a different attorney.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.417
At that point,
I pulled out the phone book

16:24.517 --> 16:26.653
and I started contacting attorneys.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.688
I was turned down by several.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.058
They told me it was too big.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.327
I believe they were probably scared
by what had happened in Missouri.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.263
Didn't want to take it on.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.037
When I first arrived at Erik's office,

16:44.137 --> 16:46.773
it's this little, tiny,
house-looking thing.

16:46.873 --> 16:50.243
I remember walking in and I sat in just,
like, a little side chair,

16:50.343 --> 16:52.312
and my mother was nervous.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.147
And I thought,

16:55.348 --> 16:59.052
"Hmm, what kind of an attorney operates

16:59.152 --> 17:02.455
out of what looks to be a house
turned into a law office?"

17:03.090 --> 17:05.291
What was your first impression of Erik?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.294
He was short.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.335
Everybody thought and told me
that we were going to lose,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.069
99 to 1, we're gonna lose.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.637
He doesn't just take no as an answer.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.508
Well, at first I thought,
this is insurmountable.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.243
And I just disagreed
with them, completely.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.747
How is it possibly legal

17:27.847 --> 17:31.551
that a company makes
millions of dollars every year

17:31.651 --> 17:35.722
helping pimps sell
human sex trafficking victims,

17:35.822 --> 17:37.190
including children.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.659
Why would Congress ever grant immunity

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
to a company that engages
in conduct like this?

17:42.462 --> 17:43.630
And he said, "Let's do this.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.632
Let's stop Backpage
for what they've done to you."

17:46.466 --> 17:47.834
And he was on board from day one.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.405
She was right out of seventh grade,

17:52.505 --> 17:55.342
and she was trafficked for a long time.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.643
And very heavily.

17:57.977 --> 18:03.483
Getting raped on a daily basis
by upwards of 20 adults a day,

18:03.783 --> 18:06.153
having at these seventh grade kids

18:06.419 --> 18:07.387
any way they want.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.822
And that happens.
And it's real.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.658
Of the kids that we serve,

18:11.758 --> 18:15.295
almost half of them are meeting
their exploiters online.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.729
They're using well-known

18:16.829 --> 18:19.432
and sophisticated recruitment
and grooming tactics.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.176
Love, charm, and violence.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.279
And fear. Fear comes with violence.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.347
They'll have a spotter.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.716
Maybe in a mall.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.719
Fast-food places like
Burger King and McDonald's.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.621
If they see any low self-esteem,

18:41.721 --> 18:43.156
or they're holding their head down

18:43.256 --> 18:45.158
they're walking, and they don't
make eye contact,

18:45.258 --> 18:47.227
those are the ones that they go after.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.662
Frankly what we see
most frequently is seduction.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.265
You used seduction, you used love.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.600
Did you...

18:54.567 --> 18:55.835
I wouldn't say love,
but I used seduction.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.405
Until she feels like
this person's her whole world.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.640
The easiest way tocontrol these girls is

19:00.740 --> 19:02.275
through the use of narcotics.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.178
And what we primarily see
is meth and heroin.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.379
Which they call the leash.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.749
We typically see the recruiting
process happen at methadone clinics.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.851
We're looking at economic instability,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.453
we're looking at housing instability.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.288
What do you tell her to watch out for?

19:16.356 --> 19:20.159
A guy that's talking about he's
gonna solve all your problems.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.629
Who in the world can do that?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.865
For a lot of folks that trade sex,

19:25.965 --> 19:28.535
very often it's the least shitty

19:28.635 --> 19:30.670
of a lot of shittier options.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.207
How much money did
any of these women make?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.543
- How much did you make?
- It wasn't their money, it was mine.

19:36.643 --> 19:40.179
I made an undetermined amount of money

19:40.280 --> 19:41.414
that was not their money.

19:41.748 --> 19:46.853
Don't play with my money.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.823
Ever.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.361
When you step back and
you look at the dynamics,

19:54.727 --> 19:58.531
this is nothing less
than modern day slavery.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.433
You're just a product.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.836
Backpage is the Walmart
of human trafficking.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.872
It's the public square.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.683
Shut it down! Shut it down!

20:16.816 --> 20:20.487
Shut it down!
Shut it down! Shut it down!

20:20.987 --> 20:22.989
By the Spring of 2012,

20:23.089 --> 20:25.725
several anti-trafficking groups
begin mounting

20:25.825 --> 20:27.727
public pressure on Backpage.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.699
My name is Liz McDougall,

20:34.033 --> 20:35.768
and I am here on behalf of
Village Voice Media Holdings,

20:35.868 --> 20:37.804
which owns Backpage.com.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.908
I did not join Village Voice
and Backpage

20:42.008 --> 20:48.648
and to defend a company for engaging
in illegal activity for profit.

20:48.748 --> 20:53.353
I came with their commitment that I
had the power and the free reign

20:53.453 --> 20:56.323
to figure out the best ways
to fight trafficking online...

20:56.423 --> 20:59.759
I think hat you're missing is that
you are a key part of the problem.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.863
I don't deny that Backpage
is part of the problem, but

21:03.963 --> 21:05.465
the problem is the internet.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.635
You're making a profit off these pimps,

21:08.735 --> 21:11.037
putting these girls on your website.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.939
I have to tell you this is something...

21:13.039 --> 21:14.707
This is the fourth hearing that I have,

21:14.841 --> 21:16.709
and I've said this
throughout this afternoon.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.746
Every one of my hearings,
Backpage is mentioned.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.548
I'd like to have a dialog with you,

21:21.648 --> 21:22.982
not a confrontation
and not an argument...

21:23.082 --> 21:25.352
This is a hearing,
so I'm questioning you.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.820
Right now, we are doing
more than anybody else

21:27.954 --> 21:29.356
to help in the fight...

21:29.456 --> 21:30.723
I want to just stop...

21:30.823 --> 21:32.325
You're talking about being genuine.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.993
You need to be transparent
and accountable.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.029
If you're not gonna do that, then
really you're not being truthful.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.666
Are you thinking about setting
up a drug dealing section

21:39.766 --> 21:41.568
of the Backpage.com website?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.537
I refuse to answer that question.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.374
How about a gun trading
or weapons trading section.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.308
I'm sorry, are we here to have
a sarcastic back and forth,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.010
or would you like to exchange
useful information?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.979
So far you haven't
given us any information

21:53.079 --> 21:55.615
on the volume of what's
happening on Backpage.com.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.817
You haven't given us any
information on your profits.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.519
You get up there and make statements.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.821
The way a hearing works is
that we ask tough questions.

22:01.921 --> 22:02.889
Yes, that's how it works.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.657
You're welcome to ask tough questions,

22:05.792 --> 22:07.394
but you have to give me
the opportunity to reply fully,

22:07.494 --> 22:08.495
and you've interrupted me twice.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.697
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me answer fully.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.899
My point is there is a protocol

22:12.999 --> 22:15.502
with the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.370
We're actually very proud.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.407
We've been praised by that organization,

22:20.507 --> 22:22.375
the CEO of that organization,

22:22.475 --> 22:25.978
for the 2600 reports that we have made.

22:26.646 --> 22:30.683
NCMEC has a slightly different view
of its interactions with Backpage.

22:31.651 --> 22:36.022
My impression was, they were
more interested in using

22:36.122 --> 22:39.626
an association with the National
Center to clean up their public image.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.662
It became apparent to us at NCMEC

22:42.762 --> 22:46.098
that Backpage likely
would not be adopting

22:46.198 --> 22:48.501
any of the measures that we recommended.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.471
Discussions with Carl Ferrer,
Backpage's CEO,

22:51.571 --> 22:54.607
often surrounded the fact
that his moderators

22:54.707 --> 22:56.676
were making reports about ads

22:56.776 --> 22:59.912
that depicted possible
children being exploited.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.049
I saw an ad for a young lady

23:03.149 --> 23:06.486
that looked like she could have
been 14 or 15 at least once a week.

23:06.819 --> 23:10.156
And we would ask him repeatedly,
"Why are those ads still online?"

23:13.225 --> 23:16.429
There was an enormous amount of
activity that people were undertaking

23:16.529 --> 23:19.566
to try to mobilize
a response against Backpage.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.834
Good evening, everyone. It is
ten o'clock here on the East Coast,

23:21.934 --> 23:24.771
and we begin tonight with Keeping Them
Honest in a corner of the internet

23:24.871 --> 23:26.773
that's accused of being
a marketplace for pimps

23:26.873 --> 23:29.676
to peddle prostitution
and exploit young women.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.780
Fifty-one attorneys general in the
United States want it shut down.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.816
So do 19 US senators,
600 religious leaders,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.919
and nearly a quarter million people
who have already signed a petition.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.421
Pressure on the website
has been building for months.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.157
We're doing everything
to impede prostitution,

23:45.257 --> 23:49.962
to impede the exploitation of
women, children, sex trafficking.

23:50.062 --> 23:54.467
The internet is, unfortunately,
the vehicle for this.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.569
We are trying to be the sheriff.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.839
If you saw your daughter
in this, like this, what...

24:00.039 --> 24:01.140
I would be horrified,

24:01.240 --> 24:03.910
and I'm horrified for those mothers,

24:04.010 --> 24:07.647
and my heart goes out to those
mothers and to their daughters.

24:07.747 --> 24:11.784
I'd like to know how she feels about
who should be held responsible.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.085
So, if it was her child,

24:13.185 --> 24:15.154
who do you think should be responsible?

24:15.254 --> 24:17.189
If those were
your child's pictures you saw?

24:18.057 --> 24:20.026
She puts the same information out there,

24:20.126 --> 24:22.729
Collects her paycheck, and
somehow she sleeps at night.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.963
And I don't know how she does it.

24:23.996 --> 24:27.667
I want to just shake her
and make her understand.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.770
But I know maybe coins
and dollars might fall out.

24:31.771 --> 24:35.542
We are here to demand
an end to sex trafficking

24:35.642 --> 24:37.009
and we're not going away.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.046
Village Voice had a strong reputation,

24:40.146 --> 24:41.914
you know, for fighting corruption,

24:42.014 --> 24:44.717
and for them right now to be doing this,

24:44.817 --> 24:47.654
and in some way
promoting sex trafficking

24:47.754 --> 24:53.492
because you allowing these ads
to happen is really unfortunate.

24:56.162 --> 25:01.534
The Voice played a role in New York
City's journalism that was unequaled.

25:01.768 --> 25:06.105
Everybody on the left in New York read
it, it was the Bible of a movement.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.842
As the press should, it's part of
our mandate to bait politicians

25:10.009 --> 25:11.143
and check their power.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.879
That's what we're supposed to do.

25:12.979 --> 25:17.016
It was a paper that dealt with
the issues you cared about.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.919
When did you first hear of Backpage.com?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.622
Not until fairly recently, I gotta say.

25:23.956 --> 25:29.095
In 2005, The Village Voice was
sold to the Phoenix-based New Times,

25:29.195 --> 25:31.948
an alternative newspaper
chain co-founded

25:31.949 --> 25:34.701
by Michael Lacey and
owned by Jim Larkin.

25:36.268 --> 25:40.607
The New Times, like The Village Voice,
had a tradition of progressive,

25:40.707 --> 25:42.775
anti-establishment reporting.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.878
I called them the cowboys from Phoenix.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.715
But I didn't understand how their
business operation worked.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.550
When we learned about Backpage,
it was on the Internet.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.053
It wasn't something that we could
see, it wasn't in the paper.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.024
The revenue coming in
was completely off the books

25:58.124 --> 25:59.759
in terms of what we could see.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.830
We'd always had personal ads
and display ads

26:04.063 --> 26:05.164
which were massage parlors.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.300
Some of them were for prostitutes,

26:08.400 --> 26:11.771
but a lot of them were just people
offering invitations to sex.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.875
Adults and their sexual practices
and preferences is one thing.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.244
When we found out about Backpage,

26:18.344 --> 26:20.246
there was something else
entirely going on there.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.015
People are actually, apparently,
trafficking young girls.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.352
Immediately, Lacey and his people

26:26.452 --> 26:29.656
started talking about how they
believed in prostitution.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.994
The owners of Backpage can
talk about this all day long.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.295
That is freedom of speech.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.932
They were looking for a journalistic
cover for what they were doing.

26:40.032 --> 26:44.170
But it is illegal to
sell children for sex.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.104
Period.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.306
It's child abuse.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.976
My father, Norman Mailer,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.845
was one of three people
that started this paper.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.015
And it's very hard for me
to be up here today

26:56.115 --> 26:59.018
because I've always loved
The Village Voice.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.821
So, to the owners of
the Village Voice Media,

27:03.723 --> 27:07.126
you hold the legacy of
this paper in your hands.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.329
Please, do the right thing.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.064
Take it down.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.671
That same month in Seattle,

27:18.771 --> 27:22.041
Nacole begins a telephone
campaign to her state senators

27:22.141 --> 27:25.011
on behalf of Senate Bill 6251,

27:25.111 --> 27:29.348
which would require websites to
obtain age verification for sex ads.

27:30.817 --> 27:35.154
The goal is to ensure that children
are not being advertised online.

27:37.890 --> 27:42.194
I am the mother of a juvenile victim
that was exploited on Backpage.com.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.663
I did hear you say
about the First Amendment,

27:44.997 --> 27:48.835
and I'm asking "whose
voice are we protecting?"

27:49.135 --> 27:51.838
Are you protecting the website
that makes millions?

27:52.905 --> 27:56.142
These girls need a voice and I'm
asking that you be their voice.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.679
Washington State enacted
a first-of-its-kind statute

28:00.780 --> 28:04.116
because of the number of reports
we had of underage girls

28:04.216 --> 28:07.053
being essentially sold on Backpage.com.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.723
And when that bill passed,
I was so proud.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.259
I was proud of the State of Washington.

28:13.993 --> 28:18.397
Backpage.com is making something
like $30 million a year.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.800
They are going to push back.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.136
But let them push.

28:27.139 --> 28:31.043
There are new battle lines being
drawn in court over Backpage.com.

28:31.310 --> 28:34.213
The State of Washington passed a law
that's set to take effect today

28:34.313 --> 28:37.249
that would require Backpage
to verify the ages of

28:37.349 --> 28:39.485
the people advertising in
the adult services section.

28:39.919 --> 28:44.023
It's designed to prevent children
from being advertised online.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.689
That's something that
we've been exploring

28:45.691 --> 28:47.327
for months and are
continuing to explore.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.995
When you're talking
about the internet...

28:49.095 --> 28:50.496
What does that mean,
"continuing to explore"?

28:50.596 --> 28:52.832
You guys have been in business
for a very long time.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.802
There have been plenty of people who
have wanted you to do this before.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.270
This isn't the first time you've
ever considered this idea.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.873
So why not just be able to say,
"Yeah, we're gonna do this"?

29:00.973 --> 29:03.109
It's gonna cost money, but if
that's the right thing to do.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.743
Money is not the issue.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.113
The issue is how do you
functionally implement this.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.382
If you have any knowledge and
understanding of how the internet works,

29:10.482 --> 29:13.920
it's a practical impossibility
in the internet realm.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.323
Now, I'm clearly not an internet
expert, but I'm not an idiot.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.992
Clearly to me, it seems to be
this is an issue of money.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.130
I soon came to realize that Backpage.com

29:24.230 --> 29:26.776
was gonna do everything
in their power to

29:26.777 --> 29:29.201
make sure that this bill wasn't signed.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.691
Backpage argues that Senate Bill 6251

29:32.693 --> 29:35.809
would violate Section 230 of the CDA.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.112
That they have no responsibility
for third party postings.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.983
The court agrees, and the bill dies.

Mommy! Mom!

30:30.596 --> 30:33.399
I wanted to blame myself
for my dad's drinking,

30:33.565 --> 30:35.902
for my mom's crying all the time

30:36.002 --> 30:37.136
and her emotional breakdown.

30:38.971 --> 30:39.768
There's not a handbook to tell you

30:39.770 --> 30:40.840
what happens when
your daughter is raped,

30:40.940 --> 30:42.508
and all these things happen.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.878
I wanted to blame myself even
for the man who had taken me.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.047
You know, I wanted to
blame myself for that.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.184
You're walking around the house with
an 800-pound elephant in the room

30:52.284 --> 30:53.385
that nobody talks about.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.556
All the time my daughter has been
traumatized beyond imagine.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.391
And we had been traumatized.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.027
We didn't know how to deal with it.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.929
And we didn't know
how to help her deal with it.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.364
I was just trying to hold it
together as best I could.

31:05.597 --> 31:10.869
Trying to wrap my head
around how you take a child

31:10.970 --> 31:13.372
that was a soccer star, a violinist,

31:13.672 --> 31:17.476
and 36 hours later,
she's being sold on a website.

31:17.643 --> 31:22.181
My favorite hobbies
are soccer and violin.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.951
My favorite song is
Crank That by Soulja Boy.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.587
When I grow up, I'd like to be a doctor.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.026
Something is gone as
a piece of her soul was gone.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.266
In September of 2012,

31:40.366 --> 31:43.435
Village Voice owners,
Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin

31:43.535 --> 31:46.939
decide to spin Backpage off
into a separate company.

31:47.273 --> 31:51.443
They leave The Village Voice, but
elect to stay with Backpage.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.947
They couldn't walk away
from the real money.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.384
Here are these guys who had
presented themselves to us as like,

31:59.918 --> 32:01.353
"We really care about journalism.
We really care about the news."

32:02.321 --> 32:03.255
And they decided to go with this money

32:03.990 --> 32:05.024
for this absolutely atrocious

32:06.025 --> 32:07.293
sex marketing operation
that they were running.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.062
The fact that
the owners of Backpage.com,

32:10.162 --> 32:12.431
who forever have tried to say,

32:12.531 --> 32:15.934
"We fight for media rights
and we fight for free speech,"

32:16.035 --> 32:20.539
when they decided to divert
from Village Voice, they said,

32:20.639 --> 32:22.074
"We're staying with Backpage."

32:22.508 --> 32:24.443
Don't tell me you're
not in it for the money.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.046
Dealing with Lacey and
listening to all this jive

32:27.146 --> 32:29.248
about how he was
such a hard-nosed journalist.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.217
"we broke a lot of stories,"
stuff like that,

32:31.317 --> 32:33.085
and then to see him walk away

32:33.185 --> 32:35.521
from one of the most
distinguished names of newspaper

32:35.621 --> 32:37.656
in the history of
20th century journalism

32:37.756 --> 32:40.192
to go into the sex ad thing
just seemed like,

32:40.292 --> 32:42.594
"wow, man, the world is
more messed up than I thought."

32:42.794 --> 32:48.200
It's also possible to look at this in,
really, just a slightly different way,

32:48.567 --> 32:51.370
which is just as sad, maybe even sadder.

32:51.470 --> 32:56.142
It's possible that Mike Lacey actually
did believe in good journalism

32:56.242 --> 33:00.012
and that that's why he created
an alternative newspaper empire.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.249
But what's really sad is in the end,

33:03.349 --> 33:07.253
he would prefer to own Backpage
than to own a real newspaper.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.222
It must have been hard to let go

33:11.657 --> 33:13.392
because you guys had run the
thing for so long, for a decade.

33:14.726 --> 33:18.697
Well, I do think
it is difficult to let go,

33:19.165 --> 33:22.634
but believe me, the people we worked
with were happy to have us let go.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.679
By the end of 2012,

33:33.779 --> 33:36.715
public pressure on Backpage
seems to evaporate,

33:38.284 --> 33:42.088
even though it continues to
dominate the market for sex ads.

33:42.754 --> 33:47.259
There is a sense of hopelessness
that begins to set in a little bit.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.462
And as long as these
massive facilitators exist,

33:50.562 --> 33:54.366
we're falling short as a field
of where we need to get to.

34:06.345 --> 34:09.681
In March of 2013,
Backpage files a motion

34:09.781 --> 34:12.650
asking the court to
dismiss Nacole's case.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.654
I wouldn't say I'm an expert today,

34:15.754 --> 34:18.056
but one of the issues that we're having

34:18.157 --> 34:22.761
is Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.730
Somewhere in that bill,

34:24.830 --> 34:28.065
it protects websites like Backpage.com.

34:28.766 --> 34:32.170
The reason Congress enacted
Section 230 in the first place

34:32.271 --> 34:35.107
was because of a lawsuit
filed by Stratton Oakmont,

34:35.206 --> 34:38.577
the boiler-room securities operation
founded by Jordan Belfort,

34:38.677 --> 34:41.213
better known as The Wolf of Wall Street.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.449
- The show goes on!
- Yeah!

34:45.217 --> 34:46.685
This is my home!

34:48.154 --> 34:52.090
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking
ball to take me out of here.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.759
Fuck them!

34:55.726 --> 34:58.264
A bulletin board,
by the name of Prodigy,

34:58.364 --> 35:00.399
this was the very early days
of the internet,

35:00.499 --> 35:03.235
accepted a post from
one of their members

35:03.335 --> 35:07.273
that basically said that Belfort,
Porush and people at Stratton Oakmont

35:07.373 --> 35:09.775
were manipulating stocks
and that they were criminals.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.678
The court found that Prodigy was liable

35:12.778 --> 35:16.282
for its failure to remove the comments
posted about Stratton Oakmont,

35:16.382 --> 35:18.350
and Belfort's firm won the case.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.654
This decision meant that the courts,
before the CDA was enacted,

35:22.754 --> 35:24.590
found that websites could be responsible

35:24.690 --> 35:27.426
for third party content
posted on their sites.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.329
If Facebook were to get sued every time

35:30.429 --> 35:33.532
a fifth grade kid said something
bad about their teacher,

35:33.632 --> 35:35.667
there'd be a lot of
unnecessary lawsuits.

35:36.235 --> 35:39.438
And that law created a safe harbor

35:39.538 --> 35:43.742
for people who act as a
conduit for internet content.

35:44.210 --> 35:48.314
Primarily, to the benefit
of the vast majority of websites

35:48.414 --> 35:51.717
that have nothing to do
with illegal content.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.754
The most ironic thing is
that the postings were true,

35:55.854 --> 35:59.157
because Belfort and others from
Stratton Oakmont pled guilty

35:59.258 --> 36:01.293
to manipulating
that particular security.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.661
And who chased Belfort?

36:02.761 --> 36:03.729
Well, that would be me.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.871
One of the theories we have

36:14.172 --> 36:16.942
is that Backpage is, in fact,
in a conspiracy with the pimps,

36:17.042 --> 36:20.512
that the posting rules
are not designed to prevent

36:20.612 --> 36:22.614
or to stop human sex trafficking,

36:22.948 --> 36:25.784
but in fact, are designed
to be a guide to pimps

36:25.884 --> 36:31.423
to allow them to design an ad which
helps them evade law enforcement.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.694
So, instead of saying, "Come here,
and we'll sell you sex for $100,"

36:35.794 --> 36:38.330
these ads will say something
more innocuous like,

36:38.430 --> 36:42.200
"Face down, ass up,
come see Tasha, $80 specials."

36:42.501 --> 36:45.437
There's an entire system of code words

36:45.537 --> 36:47.706
like "fresh" or "off the boat"

36:47.806 --> 36:50.376
that are supposed to indicate
that someone's under-aged.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.944
Everybody who's in the
industry and who's buying

36:53.044 --> 36:54.746
knows exactly what those signals mean.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.355
Emojis are a new visual language.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.391
So, a rose is not a rose,

37:05.491 --> 37:07.993
and an umbrella
has nothing to do with rain.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.428
It's code.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.862
You couldn't have 30 minutes.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.532
However, you could say HH,
which means half hour.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.667
Without saying it was okay,

37:15.767 --> 37:18.770
it was basically known
that this code is okay.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.907
You know, emojis are the new
way to get words across.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.944
So, the little water signs, "no
umbrellas," that was allowed.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.012
And what would that mean?

37:27.112 --> 37:28.380
No condoms.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.283
I don't think a lot of us stopped

37:31.383 --> 37:34.486
and thought, "This could be
our sister or our brother."

37:34.586 --> 37:36.655
It didn't particularly hit home for me

37:36.755 --> 37:38.890
until I started realizing
that this could have been me.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.359
Yeah.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.414
I dropped her off at her friend's house

38:02.514 --> 38:05.851
and she was to be home
right after the mall closed.

38:06.418 --> 38:11.523
I contacted the police,
I contacted the FBI.

38:11.623 --> 38:15.494
I started calling some of
the numbers on her phone log

38:15.594 --> 38:18.063
and I had two men tell me

38:18.163 --> 38:23.335
that they got my daughter's
phone number from Backpage.

38:23.869 --> 38:28.807
All three of our clients
were about 15 years old

38:28.907 --> 38:32.511
when they were first
advertised on Backpage.com.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.747
We say that they are engaged
in affirmative conduct

38:35.847 --> 38:39.651
which directly violates
a criminal statute,

38:39.751 --> 38:42.988
The Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.857
They're saying they're not responsible

38:45.957 --> 38:48.594
for what people put on their website.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.762
It goes much deeper than that.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.799
What's on their website
affects and hurt,

38:53.899 --> 38:56.568
and traumatized a lot of people.

38:57.403 --> 39:00.338
When these ads
involving kids are posted,

39:00.472 --> 39:04.843
the responses from potential customers
start coming in within seconds.

39:04.943 --> 39:08.580
The ad would be
live until it got approved,

39:08.880 --> 39:12.017
anywhere from 30 seconds to two hours.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.886
There are customers
who are seeing those kids

39:14.986 --> 39:17.088
before the moderation ever occurs.

39:18.089 --> 39:22.027
It was easy to use Backpage because
you're sitting alone at home,

39:22.127 --> 39:25.931
at your own leisure, and it was
almost like shopping on Amazon.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.501
One of our plaintiffs told us,
"People used to order me on Backpage

39:29.601 --> 39:31.837
as easily as you can order a pizza."

39:32.538 --> 39:34.906
I had got addicted to watching porn.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.742
It was like a gateway drug.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.745
Did you ever purchase sex from a minor?

39:39.978 --> 39:42.514
No. I agreed to.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.416
That's what I got was arrested for.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.819
Because you got arrested,
I'm assuming your wife found out.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.855
- Yes.
- How about your kids?

39:49.955 --> 39:52.591
My youngest one ran
in the bathroom and threw up.

39:53.559 --> 39:54.560
In the US,

39:55.461 --> 39:57.729
one out of seven men

39:57.829 --> 40:02.400
say that they have bought
illegal commercial sex.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.635
They're white. They're married.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.871
They live in the suburbs
and they have children.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.640
They aren't the people you would guess.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.609
I've had from priests,

40:10.709 --> 40:13.512
from lawyers to politicians.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.982
Many men who buy sex don't realize
the harm they're causing.

40:17.148 --> 40:22.954
I want it to be clear and known that
my daughter, Jane Doe, was raped.

40:37.135 --> 40:41.172
The three Jane Doe victims in
Boston are represented by Ropes & Gray,

40:42.107 --> 40:45.877
one of the oldest and most prestigious
law firms in the country.

40:48.714 --> 40:51.950
Our goal is to establish that Backpage

40:52.050 --> 40:54.920
is responsible for what has
happened to these kids.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.827
There are a number of things
that Backpage does

41:01.927 --> 41:06.532
that enables these pimps to more
successfully traffic victims.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.138
Allowing them to
use prepaid credit cards,

41:13.839 --> 41:17.609
and to post phone numbers
not as numerical digits

41:17.709 --> 41:19.678
but by spelling certain digits out.

41:19.778 --> 41:24.750
Like 251 can be T-W-O and then
the number five and the O-N-E.

41:24.850 --> 41:28.520
And what that does is obstructs
the ability for law enforcement

41:28.620 --> 41:29.655
to track down phone numbers.

41:30.656 --> 41:31.256
The other thing they do
is allow these Bitcoin.

41:35.093 --> 41:39.264
Also, we alleged that
Backpage initiated a scheme

41:39.364 --> 41:40.899
to deceive law enforcement

41:40.999 --> 41:45.236
while they increased their market
share to becomea dominant player.

41:45.771 --> 41:49.007
One of the things that they
did as part of that strategy,

41:49.107 --> 41:51.810
is that they hired general
counsel, Liz McDougall,

41:51.977 --> 41:54.680
to portray themselves as
a company that was engaged

41:54.780 --> 41:56.882
in an effort to police the internet.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.886
And they hired her to become, in
effect, the face of the company.

42:00.986 --> 42:04.255
I met Liz McDougall when I was
Deputy Mayor for the City of New York,

42:04.355 --> 42:07.693
and she was so lovely,
and she was so credible.

42:07.793 --> 42:12.163
As she told me of all the things
that they did to protect children.

42:12.598 --> 42:15.967
I think they called themselves,
"The Sheriff of the Internet."

42:18.937 --> 42:21.873
Okay, boys, fun is over.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.142
Now, I had just gotten a new iPad

42:24.242 --> 42:25.711
and so then I stopped and I said,

42:25.811 --> 42:29.180
"I think I'm about to buy a 13-year-old.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.682
"How do you explain this?"

42:31.216 --> 42:33.118
And she seems surprised

42:33.218 --> 42:36.087
when people accuse the company
of facilitating trafficking.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.923
Particularly child trafficking.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.926
And she was, "Oh, my. Let me see that.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.662
That's a mistake.
Something went wrong.

42:43.762 --> 42:44.896
We're going to fix that."

42:45.230 --> 42:46.865
That is bullshit.

42:51.837 --> 42:53.004
I unfortunately have to say

42:54.139 --> 42:56.174
that Backpage's legal strategy
has been very effective.

42:56.274 --> 42:59.210
It's a mystery to me
that Backpage keeps winning,

42:59.678 --> 43:04.182
and that Backpage keeps
winning in such grand style.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.252
Very expensive lawyers,

43:08.086 --> 43:13.158
cloaking themselves in
the First Amendment and Section 230.

43:13.258 --> 43:16.361
As far as a legal strategy,
I guess it's brilliant,

43:16.461 --> 43:17.729
'cause it has worked.

43:17.863 --> 43:20.331
But is it right?
No. It's not right.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.941
In Seattle, a hearing
is scheduled in Nacole's case,

43:30.041 --> 43:33.078
nearly two years after
it was originally filed.

43:34.379 --> 43:36.181
The Washington State Supreme Court

43:37.749 --> 43:41.119
will decide whether Section 230 of
the CDA should protect Backpage.

43:41.953 --> 43:45.724
NCMEC, which is no longer in
discussions with Backpage,

43:45.824 --> 43:48.193
files a brief in support
of Nacole's case,

43:48.293 --> 43:51.396
along with Covenant House,
Shared Hope, and others.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.801
Did you have any
ambivalence filing the brief,

43:55.901 --> 43:57.803
given your history with Backpage?

43:58.103 --> 43:58.970
No.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.155
He reached out to us and
asked if we'd be willing to help him

44:17.488 --> 44:19.991
basically battle against Backpage.com.

44:20.458 --> 44:25.997
This is maybe the most important case
that we handle in our legal career.

44:26.264 --> 44:29.701
We're looking at the CDA to figure out,
you know, how do we get around this?

44:29.801 --> 44:32.670
There's 300-plus cases
out there going the other way.

44:39.144 --> 44:41.813
Everyone wanted to do the oral argument,

44:41.913 --> 44:44.816
that's always kind of the cherry
on top of the ice cream there.

44:44.916 --> 44:48.253
Initially, I thought a more seasoned
appellate lawyer should do it.

44:48.353 --> 44:51.356
I'm essentially a street lawyer
when it gets right down to it.

44:51.790 --> 44:54.692
Erik was adamant that
he wanted to argue the case,

44:54.793 --> 44:56.261
and we talked about it.

44:56.361 --> 44:57.262
He's stubborn.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.098
One stubborn guy.

45:01.767 --> 45:06.037
They ended up deciding that, you know, I
could go ahead and do the oral argument.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.753
I remember being at the courthouse,

45:21.853 --> 45:24.189
and there were people
outside holding signs

45:24.289 --> 45:27.225
and I thought, you know,
how cool to have all this support.

45:27.358 --> 45:29.494
I mean, this is the Supreme Court.
I mean, it's huge.

45:29.594 --> 45:30.996
I was amped.

45:31.262 --> 45:34.732
Tom and I went off alone, and prayed.

45:37.235 --> 45:42.073
J.S., S.L., and L.C. versus
Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.009
May it please the court,
my name is Jim Grant,

45:44.109 --> 45:45.811
I'm here on behalf of the petitioners,

45:47.345 --> 45:49.247
Village Voice Media Incorporated,
Backpage.com and New Times Media.

45:50.715 --> 45:52.750
Congress made a clear policy
choice in enacting Section 230 of

45:54.619 --> 45:56.528
the Communications Decency
Act, and the choice

45:56.529 --> 45:58.356
was to preserve free
speech on the internet,

45:59.090 --> 46:04.162
Congress decided to give online service
providers immunity for their actions

46:04.262 --> 46:06.331
for content posted by third parties.

46:06.431 --> 46:09.067
The point is that when
that third party posts online,

46:09.167 --> 46:10.501
you cannot sue the website.

46:11.069 --> 46:13.972
The attorneys for Backpage
did their normal argument

46:14.072 --> 46:15.807
that they're here to protect children,

46:15.907 --> 46:18.243
and that they are protected
under the CDA.

46:18.343 --> 46:21.512
Your client wouldn't say with
a straight face that it's unaware

46:21.612 --> 46:24.515
that escort services is really
something else most of the time.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.917
I would say that...

46:27.986 --> 46:31.890
certainly we all know that unlawful
things occur over the internet

46:31.990 --> 46:35.160
and that there have been occasions
when other things have occurred.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.528
The kind of protection
that 230 provides,

46:37.628 --> 46:41.399
it is a blanket immunity, and this
can seem extreme in some cases.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.935
You know, the more extreme
you take a hypothetical,

46:44.035 --> 46:45.070
the more questionable it can seem.

46:45.170 --> 46:48.139
If you are making
a living off of snuff films

46:48.539 --> 46:52.878
because you are attracting that
as your content to your website,

46:52.978 --> 46:54.846
and that's what you're
making your money doing.

46:54.946 --> 46:57.148
It's like a partner in
crime, if you will.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.416
May it please the court.

47:00.051 --> 47:03.488
My name is Erik Bauer, and I represent
the minor respondents in this matter.

47:03.588 --> 47:06.091
When Erik stood up to argue,
I was feeling elated.

47:06.191 --> 47:09.260
We had been preparing for
so long, and it was just time.

47:09.427 --> 47:12.330
I've never seen him get so
emotionally involved in a case.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.832
It's not the size of the
building or the size of the ad,

47:15.166 --> 47:18.904
it's the determination and the
passion put into the fight.

47:19.370 --> 47:22.207
My clients were
in the seventh and ninth grade

47:22.307 --> 47:27.278
when they became controlled by adult
professional sex traffickers, pimps.

47:27.445 --> 47:31.016
So, why is Backpage liable?

47:31.116 --> 47:33.451
Backpage is claiming
that they have immunity

47:33.551 --> 47:37.022
for helping pimps
sell children on their website.

47:37.122 --> 47:41.927
Our assessment is, Your Honor, is that
they are responsible, at least in part,

47:42.460 --> 47:44.295
for both the creation of these ads

47:44.395 --> 47:46.197
and for the development of these ads.

47:47.732 --> 47:51.069
These so-called posting rules that
are on the Backpage.com website,

47:51.169 --> 47:55.573
they're actually instructions to pimps
on how to post an ad that works.

47:55.673 --> 48:00.145
One of their rules says, Don't advertise
time increments in 15 minutes.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.147
Hey, that's kind of short.

48:02.247 --> 48:04.950
Where can you escort somebody
in 15 minutes?

48:05.050 --> 48:07.986
They don't want it to be that
obvious, that much of a red flag.

48:08.086 --> 48:10.355
Backpage said that,
"Escort services are legal

48:10.455 --> 48:13.258
and if somebody wants to do something
illegal, that's not our fault."

48:13.358 --> 48:14.459
What's your response to that?

48:15.927 --> 48:18.964
This is prostitution masquerading
as escort, whatever escort is.

48:19.064 --> 48:23.334
I mean, are these people
wholesaling children

48:23.434 --> 48:26.004
in Washington State or not?

48:26.104 --> 48:27.438
Are they doing it deliberately?

48:28.273 --> 48:31.409
And I remember leaving there thinking,

48:31.509 --> 48:34.179
we've got this, we got this.

48:34.312 --> 48:38.249
This has been such an uphill fight,
because at every turn they've won.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.585
And then we started the wait.

48:50.161 --> 48:55.300
In December of 2014, Backpage,
which now operates in 88 countries,

48:55.500 --> 48:58.003
is reportedly sold to a Dutch company.

48:59.437 --> 49:04.109
According to a Dallas paper,
Backpage's CEO, Carl Ferrer,

49:04.209 --> 49:06.177
will continue to run the company.

49:08.146 --> 49:09.981
With a long list of questions,

49:10.081 --> 49:13.985
our search for Backpage CEO, Carl Ferrer
brings us right here.

49:14.119 --> 49:17.055
Carl Ferrer has turned down
several of our interview requests

49:17.155 --> 49:18.623
so we've come here to Amsterdam.

49:18.723 --> 49:21.259
- Carl? Carl Ferrer?
- Yes.

49:21.359 --> 49:22.994
Hi, we've been looking for you.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.329
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you have a second?

49:24.429 --> 49:26.331
I'm Gloria Riviera from ABC News.

49:26.697 --> 49:28.399
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

49:28.666 --> 49:29.967
No comment.

49:31.036 --> 49:32.237
You know, law enforcement tells us

49:33.738 --> 49:36.074
that underage girls are trafficked
on Backpage.com, your company.

49:36.174 --> 49:37.142
No comment.

49:38.543 --> 49:39.744
We saw a real-life
example of this last week...

49:40.978 --> 49:43.548
It took me a while to realize
that I was not a prostitute.

49:44.115 --> 49:45.316
I don't like that word.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.418
I was a child.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.555
At first I was like,
"Why did I run away?"

49:50.655 --> 49:54.292
The reality is that
children all across America

49:54.392 --> 49:56.294
are sneaking out of the house
all the time.

49:56.394 --> 49:58.663
I'm just a kid and shouldn't
nobody be doing this to me.

49:59.197 --> 50:03.301
Being trafficked has caused
my daughter to have anger issues.

50:04.269 --> 50:06.371
She became very reclusive.

50:06.471 --> 50:08.439
Kids at school kind of
found out what happened,

50:08.539 --> 50:10.108
so we had her home-schooled.

50:11.476 --> 50:14.579
Friends, they called me horrible
names,"whore" and "slut," and...

50:15.180 --> 50:18.349
and it's just lack of
information on their part.

50:18.449 --> 50:21.152
There are definitely people
who feel like it's your fault.

50:21.252 --> 50:24.589
And that's another reason
why you don't speak about it.

50:25.090 --> 50:29.327
And that's why I don't wanna talk
about it if I don't have to.

50:29.760 --> 50:33.231
It has been a fight to
keep her safe and to keep her alive

50:33.331 --> 50:35.733
and to keep her out of the life.

50:36.667 --> 50:39.704
She stuck by my side
when nobody else did.

50:40.105 --> 50:42.707
I lost my virginity and was raped,

50:42.807 --> 50:46.577
and I... I don't know.

50:46.744 --> 50:48.646
I definitely look at...

50:51.149 --> 50:53.451
sex differently now, I don't know.

50:53.551 --> 50:58.256
Kids in high school were so infatuated
with sex all the time, and I just...

50:58.523 --> 50:59.557
I don't know.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.327
I just look at it
completely different now.

51:02.427 --> 51:05.330
It's not everything
everybody hypes it up to be.

51:06.864 --> 51:08.662
I don't want anyone
to have to go through

51:08.664 --> 51:10.502
what my daughter has had to go through.

51:11.702 --> 51:14.605
Given the opportunity
to speak to Backpage,

51:14.705 --> 51:19.644
I would tell them that
on April the 7th, 2010,

51:19.744 --> 51:23.814
they changed our family's life forever.

51:24.315 --> 51:29.820
We will never be the family we were
before my daughter went missing,

51:30.521 --> 51:32.523
and before she was sold on that website.

51:33.491 --> 51:38.429
The CDA has given them
the ultimate say in this,

51:38.696 --> 51:44.235
and I'm here to tell them,
as a parent, I am not okay with that.

51:45.403 --> 51:49.474
I would just ask the same
question my daughter asked you.

51:51.209 --> 51:53.144
What would you do if it was your child?

52:01.752 --> 52:03.888
In April of 2015,

52:03.988 --> 52:07.692
the US Senate begins investigating
online sex trafficking.

52:09.260 --> 52:12.397
Their investigation
leads them to Backpage.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.599
The more you hear about this

52:14.699 --> 52:17.268
and the increased incidents
of sex trafficking,

52:17.702 --> 52:19.270
the more Backpage comes up.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.272
We live in a border state

52:21.372 --> 52:25.142
where a lot of this cross-border
sex trafficking takes place.

52:25.243 --> 52:26.911
And so when we said,
"How does this happen?",

52:27.011 --> 52:30.581
we realized this is coming
from advertising on Backpage.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.684
We aren't dealing with prostitution,
we're dealing with human slavery.

52:33.784 --> 52:36.487
Is Backpage an innocent facilitator

52:36.587 --> 52:39.624
or do they actually have
a more active role

52:39.724 --> 52:43.361
in fashioning the kinds of ads
that are actually being placed?

52:43.794 --> 52:45.796
Do they have clean hands here?

53:00.745 --> 53:05.583
The Court said that Congress
could protect exploited children

53:05.683 --> 53:07.818
or it could protect the internet.

53:07.918 --> 53:10.655
And that it chose
to protect the internet.

53:11.656 --> 53:15.192
Now that particular statement
really pissed me off,

53:16.294 --> 53:18.863
because I don't think
Congress did any such thing.

53:25.670 --> 53:29.574
He was frustrated,
because he felt as though

53:30.475 --> 53:35.946
the Judge did not understand
what he was trying to argue.

53:36.547 --> 53:40.217
The fact that Ropes & Gray
lost is actually a revelation

53:40.318 --> 53:42.920
of how much the court system
needs to be trained

53:43.020 --> 53:44.655
on child sex trafficking.

53:46.023 --> 53:48.459
So, his decision was not
overwhelmingly surprising,

53:48.559 --> 53:50.528
it was overwhelmingly
disappointing, though.

53:50.628 --> 53:51.996
You think he's gonna say, "I've had it"?

53:52.096 --> 53:53.364
No way.

53:53.464 --> 53:54.799
- He'd never give up.
- He won't give up.

54:02.940 --> 54:07.878
Net Revenue for Backpage
hits an all-time high in 2015.

54:08.813 --> 54:11.749
That is, until
Sheriff Tom Dart in Chicago,

54:11.949 --> 54:15.720
frustrated with the number of
sex-trafficked victims he's finding

54:16.454 --> 54:18.689
decides to take matters
into his own hands.

54:21.992 --> 54:24.695
More and more of the sex industry

54:24.929 --> 54:27.865
had transferred from
the street onto the internet.

54:27.998 --> 54:30.000
We were answering ad after ad, after ad,

54:30.100 --> 54:33.371
and we were finding that
every case, every one was,

54:33.471 --> 54:36.273
in fact, someone who
was prostituting themselves,

54:36.374 --> 54:37.642
someone who was being trafficked.

54:38.843 --> 54:39.910
We'd respond to an ad,
it was always a criminal act.

54:41.145 --> 54:42.580
The crapshoot was whether
it was an adult or a child.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.384
The Sheriff recognized that
something needed to be done.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.754
Sheriff Dart sends
cease and desist letters

54:49.854 --> 54:51.456
to MasterCard and Visa

54:51.556 --> 54:53.458
informing them that
they've been in business

54:53.558 --> 54:55.760
with a company involved
in human trafficking.

54:56.126 --> 54:59.209
And as a result, both
Visa and Mastercard

54:59.210 --> 55:01.999
stopped doing business with Backpage.

55:03.434 --> 55:06.537
Backpage loses all income
from the credit card companies,

55:06.804 --> 55:08.706
a temporary blow to its revenue.

55:09.707 --> 55:12.343
It then begins offering free adult ads,

55:12.443 --> 55:16.381
with upgrades payable by
personal check or Bitcoin.

55:16.947 --> 55:19.550
What is important about
that action is that

55:19.650 --> 55:21.819
it was a number of Fortune 500 companies

55:21.919 --> 55:25.423
telling that business, that they believe
there is illegal conduct happening

55:25.523 --> 55:26.791
and they weren't gonna support it.

55:26.891 --> 55:28.793
Backpage sued Sheriff Dart

55:28.893 --> 55:32.863
claiming that his actions were a
violation of the First Amendment.

55:33.664 --> 55:36.401
It's in the courts now
and the courts are gonna decide

55:36.501 --> 55:37.735
where that's gonna go.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.538
He's put his neck on the chopping block.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.007
He does what he thinks
is right at all costs.

55:50.147 --> 55:52.339
Back in Seattle, it is now three years

55:52.341 --> 55:54.586
since Nacole's case was first filed.

55:54.985 --> 55:58.423
She's waiting for a decision from
the Washington State Supreme Court.

55:59.156 --> 56:02.092
Time goes on, and you have
days where you're like,

56:02.192 --> 56:04.695
"You know, I don't think
this can go our way."

56:05.062 --> 56:08.699
You know, the first month passed,
and then the second month passed,

56:08.799 --> 56:10.668
and then the fifth month passed.

56:10.768 --> 56:14.705
And I remember being at work
on September 3rd.

56:16.774 --> 56:18.709
My heart stopped. I was like...

56:19.944 --> 56:24.081
Limbo was okay,
because we hadn't won or lost.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.717
And I walked outside, and I prayed.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.787
And ten minutes later I got the call...

56:32.890 --> 56:34.959
that the court had found in our favor.

56:37.728 --> 56:40.097
The court ruled that
if Backpage actively helped

56:40.197 --> 56:42.633
to develop the sex ads on its site,

56:42.733 --> 56:44.635
and was not just a passive host,

56:44.735 --> 56:48.539
then Backpage should not be
protected by Section 230.

56:48.639 --> 56:51.509
The case is allowed to proceed to trial.

56:52.009 --> 56:54.612
I was absolutely stoked.

56:54.712 --> 56:56.814
We'd waited almost a year
to get that ruling,

56:56.914 --> 56:58.949
and it meant we could
proceed with this case.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.185
And I was just so grateful.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.953
I almost wrecked my car.

57:03.220 --> 57:04.655
I love Erik Bauer.

57:05.856 --> 57:08.959
There is a sense of optimism
that progress is being made

57:09.093 --> 57:11.529
and that it's not completely futile.

57:11.629 --> 57:13.097
There's not losses across the board.

57:13.197 --> 57:16.200
It was a blessing and God
was watching over us that day

57:16.300 --> 57:17.968
when they made that decision.

57:18.068 --> 57:21.739
Now I know my worth and what
I was put on earth to do.

57:21.839 --> 57:24.074
And it's to help people
that can't be helped.

57:24.241 --> 57:26.977
You know, we might actually
have a voice that would do something.

57:27.077 --> 57:29.980
I know it would help me and my daughter,

57:30.080 --> 57:33.050
and it would help so many other
girls out there that just,

57:33.150 --> 57:36.086
they don't know what's out
there until it's too late.

57:36.587 --> 57:38.723
It's hard, this fight.

57:38.856 --> 57:40.891
They know what they're doing is wrong,

57:40.991 --> 57:44.094
and they know that children are
being trafficked on their website,

57:44.194 --> 57:46.463
and they fail to do anything to fix it.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.633
And we're gonna change that.

57:53.270 --> 57:56.574
Two months later, on November 3rd, 2015,

57:57.908 --> 58:01.946
the senate subcommittee subpoenas
Carl Ferrer, Backpage's CEO,

58:02.046 --> 58:04.915
to testify at a hearing
in Washington DC.

58:05.182 --> 58:09.920
On that very same day, Backpage lays
off a majority of its moderators,

58:10.287 --> 58:14.124
advising them to call a company
lawyer if contacted by investigators.

58:15.125 --> 58:18.963
I Googled the lawyer and it looked
as though she was a criminal lawyer.

58:19.063 --> 58:23.033
It solidified the fact that there was
an underlying situation happening

58:23.133 --> 58:24.735
that was illegal.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.172
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.610
The e-mail circulated to the
Backpage employees who were laid off

58:32.710 --> 58:35.746
was from someone named
jacquie@backpage.com.

58:35.980 --> 58:38.282
But her signature line does
not actually say "Backpage."

58:38.916 --> 58:40.851
It says, "Website Technologies."

58:41.586 --> 58:44.054
A search of the Texas
Secretary of State records

58:44.154 --> 58:47.892
reveals that the president of
Website Technologies for 2015

58:47.992 --> 58:50.961
is Jim Larkin,
the original Backpage owner,

58:51.596 --> 58:53.764
contradicting the widely held assumption

58:53.864 --> 58:56.934
that he was no longer actively
involved with Backpage.

59:01.639 --> 59:05.542
That same month, the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals in Chicago

59:05.643 --> 59:08.746
agrees to hear Backpage's case
against Sheriff Dart.

59:10.815 --> 59:13.584
The issue here is whether
Sheriff Dart has trampled

59:13.684 --> 59:15.686
Backpage's First Amendment rights

59:16.120 --> 59:19.724
by sending cease and desist
letters to Visa and MasterCard.

59:20.157 --> 59:23.628
The Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals held a hearing.

59:23.728 --> 59:27.164
It was heard by three judges
including Judge Richard Posner.

59:27.264 --> 59:30.334
Judge Posner is probably, I think,
considered one of the top jurists

59:30.434 --> 59:33.003
at least in our generation
or his generation.

59:33.838 --> 59:38.809
Our first case for argument
is Backpage versus Dart.

59:38.976 --> 59:40.077
May it please the court.

59:41.378 --> 59:43.213
Sheriff Dart set up a task force
for this specific purpose

59:44.682 --> 59:47.785
of taking down Backpage.com,
as they put it, "legally or otherwise."

59:48.052 --> 59:52.857
You know, a police official has
to be very careful in what he says.

59:53.323 --> 59:57.962
Your Honor, Visa's action was
taken out of concern that their brand...

59:58.062 --> 01:00:02.833
Look, the tone of this is
so unprofessional.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.970
He talks about a violent industry.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.938
Is phone sex violent?

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:10.975
- The content of...
- Is phone sex violent?

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.342
- It can be.
- Really?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.811
- It certainly can be.
- How?

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:16.246
And what about also old people,

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.884
old men who would like to
be seen with a young woman?

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:24.922
That is an aspect of the escort service.
It's not all sex.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.792
I wasn't really sure that
Judge Posner had a firm grip

01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:29.760
on what happens on Backpage.com.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.296
It felt a bit like the twilight zone.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.298
The part that really bothered me

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:37.401
was the part where he indicated that,

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:42.673
"sometimes a man just wants to be seen
in the company of a younger female."

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.368
I mean, in my case, I had kids that are

01:00:45.369 --> 01:00:48.045
posed with, you know,
in thong underwear,

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.214
with their butts faced up at the camera.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.481
I mean, you wanna be seen in company

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:55.019
with a kid dressed in her
underwear, well, what's that?

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:01.726
I remember seeing
my little girl in her underwear.

01:01:04.729 --> 01:01:05.963
I see my child...

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.067
in different poses...

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:13.670
that look like she was drugged.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.243
When you got that call that
said your daughter is on Backpage,

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.410
what was your reaction?

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:22.379
I fell to the floor.

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:27.451
I don't know if the owners of
the website have children,

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.987
but I hope it doesn't happen to them.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.961
When the CDA is
being interpreted by courts

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:39.396
to allow websites such as Backpage.com

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.398
to engage in human sex trafficking,

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.433
then we have a problem
with the statute, I guess.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.102
Or we have a problem with the judges.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.937
Either way, we got a problem.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.840
And if the judges are too obtuse

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.842
and if they don't get it,

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.311
then I guess it needs to
be made crystal clear

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:57.481
that Congress does not support
human sex trafficking.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:06.891
Two weeks later, a senate
subcommittee convenes a hearing

01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:09.860
on child sex trafficking
in Washington DC.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.964
This hearing will now come to order.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.935
In a bipartisan staff report
released today,

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:20.004
we have outlined
some preliminary findings

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:21.806
and further questions that need answers.

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:24.859
The report reveals that Backpage has had

01:02:24.861 --> 01:02:26.377
a practice of editing
some advertisements

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:29.379
by deleting words and images
before publication.

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:32.482
These editing practices likely
serve to conceal evidence

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:35.152
of the illegality
of the underlying transaction.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.822
The National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:41.091
reported an 846 percent increase

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:43.928
in reports of suspected
child sex trafficking.

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:47.197
According to one industry analyst,
eight out of every $10 spent

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.900
on online commercial sex
advertising in the United States

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.968
goes to Backpage.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.070
The company's fair market value,

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:56.173
taking into account
its lack of marketability,

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.909
is approximately 430 million.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:02.913
We're here to talk about
the online lucrative sale

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:05.049
of America's children for sex,

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.218
which in our experience
occurs most prominently

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:10.254
on the website Backpage.com.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.189
Can you explain your testimony

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:16.126
that there is more stringent posting
rules for selling a motorcycle

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:17.494
than selling a 12-year-old?

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:21.131
I really have no explanation
for that, Senator.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:24.301
Backpage's top lawyer has
described its moderation process

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:27.571
as the key tool for disrupting and
eventually ending human trafficking.

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:31.275
Backpage initially told
its outside moderators

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.444
that they should "fail"

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:38.849
ads containing references to
certain sex acts and words,

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:44.588
including "schoolgirl," "teen,"

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:49.426
and "Y-U-N-G."

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.463
Two days later,
Backpage reversed that policy.

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:57.601
Importantly, guidance from Backpage
emphasized in all capital letters,

01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:00.204
"If in doubt about underage,

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:03.540
the process should now be
to accept the ad.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:09.579
Only delete if you're really
very sure person is underage."

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.181
That was in all caps.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.319
I'd like to call the CEO
of Backpage, Carl Ferrer.

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:28.465
We had hoped Mr. Ferrer would be here.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:30.234
He just didn't show up.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.136
Certainly not something
that you no-show for.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:34.604
Absolute disregard to not show up.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.908
Mr. Chairman, I have been a member
of this subcommittee for many years.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:42.312
I've never known of a witness
to refuse a subpoena.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:44.414
And I'm sure that you will

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:51.255
take the necessary action to ensure
that that is not done with impunity.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:54.291
He called me and said, "You're not
gonna believe". I said, "I saw it".

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.393
I've never seen anything like that.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:05:01.298
I have never seen a witness refuse
to show up in light of a subpoena.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.666
Backpage, at every turn,

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:04.901
has tried to shield anybody

01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:07.104
from getting information
behind the scenes.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:08.172
What are they hiding?

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:11.575
I think we're gonna find that
they have been tipping the scales

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:13.577
towards accepting ads

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:17.681
that clearly are designed
to get at customers

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:21.918
who want to have sex with
children, to put it plainly.

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:24.554
We want to find out, you know,
how they do business,

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.490
whether they edit
their advertisements or not.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.525
They refused to even participate.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.295
It's not only the issue of
human trafficking,

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:36.100
but it's a direct assault,
his failure to appear,

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.702
on the Constitutional
responsibilities of

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:40.570
the Congress of the United States.

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:46.043
It is very unusual for someone to say,
"Nah, I'm just not gonna show up."

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:49.246
And with that,
this hearing is adjourned.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.389
The Seventh Circuit decided that,
that kind of government pressure

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.426
against a website with
the goal of censoring it,

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:03.994
violates the First Amendment.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.563
"Nor is Sheriff Dart..."

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:10.034
"...on solid ground in
suggesting that everything..."

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:13.437
"...everything in the adult section
of Backpage's website is criminal."

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:15.505
"Fetishism? Phone sex?"

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.307
"Performances by striptease artists?"

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.276
"Vulgar is not violent."

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.610
"Vulgar is not violent."

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.146
"Vulgar is not violent."

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:25.182
One ad in the category,
'Dom and fetish...'"

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.618
"...is for the services
of 'professional dominatrix.'"

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.754
"A woman who is
paid to whip or otherwise..."

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:35.292
"...humiliate a customer in
order to arouse him sexually."

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:39.396
"It is not obvious that such
conduct endangers women or children..."

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.764
"...or violates any laws."

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:42.699
Interesting.

01:06:44.068 --> 01:06:47.771
To read something like that was,
frankly, it was alarming to me.

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:53.610
I thought it read like
a cheap, dime-store novel.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.414
These victims are predominantly
women, underage girls.

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:01.285
And I wonder if some of that gets lost

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:04.554
when the issues are being
decided by male judges.

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:07.257
The court was utterly unfamiliar

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.293
with the crime of child sex trafficking

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.196
and with some of the ads
that are posted on Backpage.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:15.031
In terms of advertising
for trafficking people,

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.167
I mean, that's not
freedom of speech stuff,

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.568
you know, that's criminal activity.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:23.140
You know, Pretty Woman. I gotta
bring up the Pretty Wom thing.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.542
We've created this sort
of myth in our culture

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:27.711
of, you know, the Julia
Roberts in Pretty Woman.

01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:33.283
And the reality is far, far different.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.351
Can't watch it.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:38.288
Can't watch it.
Loved that movie.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.492
Because Pretty Woman
is not the scenario.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:45.162
What we've done
before or after the lawsuit

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:49.833
is go out and we try to get people
who are trafficking children.

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:53.103
It's a very difficult thing to
do because of the nature of it.

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:03.680
In Boston, John Montgomery
prepares his case, Doe versus Backpage,

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.783
hoping to convince the First
Circuit Court of Appeals

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:11.488
that Section 230 should not
apply to protect Backpage.

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:17.794
May it please the court.
My name is John Montgomery.

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:22.599
What are the allegations, precisely,
of unlawful activity by Backpage?

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.368
It's operating an online marketplace

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.837
that then coaches those traffickers

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.608
who are going to
engage in that activity.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:36.345
This is a very important case to
the three young women we represent

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.849
and the many others that,
in effect, they represent.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.419
There are very few cases,
maybe two or three,

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.689
where the internet service provider
is alleged to have participated

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.192
in a federal criminal offense.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.264
Getting there by 9:00 would be terrific.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.401
Because it enables us to then
kind of walk back and forth

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.603
in front of the courthouse nervously.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.709
On January 6, 2016,

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:10.880
the First Circuit Court in Boston hears
oral arguments in Doe versus Backpage.

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:15.919
Remarkably, Justice David Souter,
formerly a Supreme Court Justice,

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.622
will be one of three judges
hearing the case.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:20.724
Mr. Montgomery, go ahead.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.893
Our principal claims are that Backpage

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.296
is engaged in
intentional criminal conduct.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.466
They had the intent to
further the sex-trafficking?

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:32.336
They intended to further
the sex-trafficking trade.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.772
What in your complaint goes the
further step of saying actually,

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:40.210
they're participating in the venture to
sex traffic, as opposed to advertise?

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:42.746
Why is that different
from what a newspaper does

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.215
when it has a special
advertising section for

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.484
Washington's Birthday Car Sales?

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.787
They host communications off-line

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:54.958
between the sellers of illegal sex,

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.527
including with children and buyers.

01:09:57.761 --> 01:09:59.629
That occurs on their site.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.599
They are participating in
the venture. That is the point.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.402
May it please the court, Jeffrey Pyle...

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:08.238
Mr. Pyle, at some point will you respond

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.840
to the last argument
that Mr. Montgomery made,

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.810
that there is something more
than advertising going on?

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.713
You are being held liable,
if we let it go forward,

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:19.616
for being a participant
in a sex-trafficking venture.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:21.651
Those ads were created by

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:24.354
the plaintiffs themselves
or by their pimps.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:25.755
Not by Backpage.com.

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:29.859
I take it you agree that
it is possible for a publisher

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.696
to also be a participant
in a sex trafficking venture,

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:35.332
where the pimp himself runs a website.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:36.466
Yes.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:41.838
Publishers usually don't go out and
participate in federal crimes,

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:44.408
let alone sex trafficking ventures.

01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:49.346
And that really is, if we can get two
judges to agree with that point,

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:51.915
I think we probably have three
judges that would agree with it,

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:53.983
that bodes very well for us.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.353
Right. The question though is,
where it takes us.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:57.387
- Right.
- Right.

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:06.696
When Justice Souter launched into
his car advertisement analogy,

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:11.034
it was sort of, "why are we comparing
trafficked girls to cars?"

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.604
There could have been better
answers to some of the questions.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:18.542
A prepared panel in a hard case means
that you could be waiting a while.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:20.644
I think we have a good shot,

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:23.913
and I can't wait to call the
Jane Does and tell them how it went.

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.449
- I think we're in the game.
- Yeah.

01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:26.850
The First Circuit argument

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.453
was certainly one of the most
active benches I've ever seen.

01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:31.521
All of the judges
had clearly read the briefs.

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.491
It made me feel a bit optimistic
in what the decision might be.

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.025
I think Ropes & Gray will win.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.429
I don't want to sound like
a Debbie the Downer,

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:43.667
but no matter how many times you come up
against the Communications Decency Act

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.502
it's always gonna shut you down.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.480
Since my daughter was sold on Backpage

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.515
she's a totally different person.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:00.083
She's traumatized.

01:12:00.584 --> 01:12:03.953
That spark and fire I used to
see in her eyes is gone.

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.722
Well, it's forever changed her.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:09.793
She blames herself.
It affects her every day.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:13.897
The guilt and just
feeling ashamed of yourself,

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:15.632
I've struggled a lot with that.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:18.668
Do you know how many mentors I've had?

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:20.737
Do you know
how many therapists I've had?

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.440
Do you know how many "friends" I've had?

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:28.077
She feels that her childhood
has been gone, ruined.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.947
She's still suffering
from that dissociative,

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:33.082
dysfunctional part of what happened.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.752
Every time I think about it,
I get sad and depressed,

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.454
and I'm having flashbacks.

01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:40.824
Violin, soccer, track, friends, uh...

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.493
memories with my brother
and sister playing.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:46.830
I mean, all of that
just kind of went away.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.131
This is one of those things

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.734
I honestly would not wish
on my worst enemy.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.370
I have to live
every single day of my life now

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.540
with everything that's happened to me.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:59.676
And my parents
have to live with the grief

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:02.078
in knowing that I go through
that every single day.

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.781
I think I've cried more this year
than I've ever cried in my life.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:05.815
Oh, my God.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:08.885
Yeah.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:22.165
We're now proceeding
with this contempt of Congress,

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.468
which sadly, we're forced to do that,

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:27.871
because Backpage refuses
to provide us information.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.574
We actually found out
through some evidence

01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:34.711
that Backpage actually instructed
people to edit advertisements,

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:37.146
including to take out
evidence of illegality.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.750
But I think that's why they're working
so hard to avoid our subpoenas.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.919
To me, that makes them complicit.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.522
What I'm going to recommend
to the subcommittee

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:49.425
is that we have a contempt of
Congress filed against Backpage.

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:51.528
And I think the committee
will go along with us.

01:13:51.628 --> 01:13:52.962
We'll see. I hope so.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:55.765
Senator McCaskill and I
today as a result

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.167
are asking the committee to
report a resolution to authorize

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.003
civil enforcement
and contempt proceedings

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.740
against Backpage and against
its CEO, Carl Ferrer.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.909
I am glad that Senator Portman is calm,

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:09.145
because every once in a while I'm
ready to do a McCain on these guys.

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:11.748
No, not that!

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:16.786
I think a McCaskill would be good
enough. I've seen it in operation.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.689
Frankly, I don't recall

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:24.661
a time when a witness has refused
to testify in this fashion.

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:26.596
I don't know if your staff has...

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:29.098
- It's been 20 years, John.
- It's been 20 years.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.067
If there is no further debate
or amendment,

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.770
the question is on final passage
of the original resolution

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:37.874
directing Senate Legal Counsel to bring
a civil action to enforce a subpoena

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.043
of this Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.111
- Senator McCain.
- Aye.

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:44.247
- Senator Portman.
- Aye.

01:14:44.347 --> 01:14:45.649
- Senator Paul.
- Aye.

01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:46.816
- Senator Langford.
- Aye.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.084
- Senator Ayotte.
- Aye.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:50.920
On this vote the yays are 15,
the nays are zero,

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.055
and the motion is agreed to.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:55.759
What we did today was we
passed through the committee

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:59.863
the first step in holding
individuals at Backpage

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:01.631
in contempt of Congress.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.967
Now, that hasn't happened in 20 years.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.268
Got a unanimous vote.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.837
By the way, it's hard to get
anything unanimous around here.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:10.974
But it'll be very interesting
to see what happens.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:16.646
The senate subcommittee took yet
another step to investigate Backpage.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:19.649
Right now, we are waiting for the
First Circuit Court of Appeals.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:23.152
One day we're excited, then get nervous.
But we're pretty confident.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.253
I would put money on us.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.757
We are actually very hopeful.

01:15:29.793 --> 01:15:33.162
This guy runs a 1400-man
law firm out of Boston.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:37.601
You've gotta be quite a lawyer to
ride herd on 1400 other sharks.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.986
Thank you to everybody for gathering

01:15:57.086 --> 01:16:00.824
and, you know, particularly to
Yiota coming up from Washington DC

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:03.059
and Erik, all the way
from Seattle, Washington.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:06.996
We could call this our first
ever in-person Backpage summit.

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.666
The first thing that I think would
be interesting to talk about

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.801
is to get everybody's reactions,

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:15.038
to the most recent decision
we have regarding Backpage.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:21.678
I was not impressed with
the First Circuit's thinking.

01:16:21.845 --> 01:16:23.212
I agree with you.
I think it's just

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:28.017
sort of a gross abdication of
responsibility by the judiciary

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:31.120
to address what's actually happening
here, which is the sale of kids.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.091
The decision seemed to
really whitewash the activities

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.794
and really say
there was some publishing here,

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:40.329
that triggers CDA, this case is over.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.099
There's just some real academic distance

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:46.670
between your federal appeals
court judge and our plaintiffs.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:50.073
In other words, these guys got to
get out of their ivory towers.

01:16:50.173 --> 01:16:53.309
I would settle for them to just go on
the internet and go to Backpage.com.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.646
I'll tell you, two out of three of
those judges do not use the internet.

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:58.815
These guys don't know
how to work their VCRs.

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:04.253
We will evaluate our approach
to the US Supreme Court.

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.989
Because our case is in progress

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:08.892
and we are going to trial
and we do intend to win,

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:12.896
I don't want to broadcast
our strategy quite yet either

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:16.165
and give Backpage a blueprint
as to what we're going to do.

01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:19.703
I think the decision was misguided.

01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:23.406
And that they wouldn't hold Backpage
responsible was very disturbing to me.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.176
There is this lofty discussion
about Section 230,

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:30.780
and at the end of the day,
the rapes are barely discussed.

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:33.783
They're discussed in passing.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:36.319
There's a line that says something
like, "So here's the tale."

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:40.389
And it's not a tale. There was
a child who was raped a thousand times.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.825
That is outrageous.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:44.227
They think Congress should
fix this, not the courts.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.064
And we think it's actually their
job and they're not doing it.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:51.935
All I know is that I'd like to
meet a member of the judiciary

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:56.139
or a member of Congress that
thinks that this situation,

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.007
the status quo is satisfactory.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:00.777
It doesn't make sense that you can sit

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:05.148
and you can hear the testimony or,
you can see all of the evidence

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:08.918
and you cannot feel a certain
amount of responsibility

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.021
to make things right.

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:15.124
We need someone to
give us a fighting chance.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:20.730
I hope that every
American would get angry as well

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:24.300
and the next time a federal
judge or a state judge

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.438
alleges that somehow this practice
is acceptable in America,

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.240
then speak up.

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:33.442
This is a legacy issue for these judges.

01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:36.295
The judges that are
making these decisions

01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:37.313
are gonna be read about in history.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.984
These judges
are gonna be judged themselves.

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:44.954
This can't happen anymore.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.356
No matter what the CDA says.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:02.939
Calendar number 375. SRES377,

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:06.309
directing the Senate legal
counsel to bring a civil action

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:09.813
to enforce a subpoena of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.882
Backpage and its Chief
Executive Officer, Carl Ferrer,

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:15.251
have not been willing to
cooperate with the committee

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.020
and unfortunately, we're at the point

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.456
where we have to seek the
enforcement of our subpoena.

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:24.894
By passing this, we will
send a message to others,

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:28.097
we will send a message to others,
I say to my colleague from Ohio,

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.433
they can run, but they can't hide.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:32.768
During our November 19th hearing,

01:19:33.036 --> 01:19:35.538
I promised that while the
subcommittee would move forward

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.473
carefully and cautiously,

01:19:37.573 --> 01:19:40.209
we would not go quietly into the night.

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:43.046
And on some day in the near future,

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:45.548
we would use the Senate's
enforcement measures

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:48.952
to compel cooperation from Backpage.

01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:51.254
Today is that day.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.022
The clerk will call the roll.

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:55.191
Mr. Johnson, aye.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.493
Miss Herono, aye.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.795
Mr. Heller, aye.

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:05.034
The vote is 96 in favor, none opposed.
Senate Resolution 377 is agreed to.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:08.404
It was a unanimous decision, 96 votes.

01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:11.540
I was so proud and so happy.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:15.311
We're gonna win.
We're gonna sink that ship.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:16.880
I guarantee it.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:24.253
Senate Resolution 377 only authorizes
the Senate to file suit against Backpage

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:25.855
to enforce its subpoena.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:30.860
But this vote could possibly be the
first step in a long protracted battle,

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.563
not just with Backpage,
but to amend Section 230.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:45.008
David Boies, fresh off, of
winning the Supreme Court case

01:20:45.108 --> 01:20:46.309
about same sex marriage,

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.978
decides to enter into the fray.

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:54.383
He, with others, begins preparing
a new lawsuit against Backpage.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.620
Good afternoon,
Boies, Schiller & Flexner.

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:01.334
When you have an
organization that clearly

01:21:01.335 --> 01:21:03.159
understands that they are facilitating

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.194
this illegal conduct,

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:09.298
it just seemed to me that it was a
terribly important case to take on.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:12.601
Our legal strategy is to demonstrate
that Backpage is everywhere.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.603
So, we are going to
file multiple lawsuits

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:18.574
and mobilize the communities that
have been touched by Backpage.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:21.077
Judges need to be educated,

01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:22.946
the public needs to be educated,

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:25.114
the Department of Justice
needs to be educated

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.216
on exactly what's going on here.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:32.221
The idea that Backpage is just trying
to cater to fetishes of old men,

01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:34.890
doesn't really
involve underage children,

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:37.393
I don't think they're gonna
be able to make that in court

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.361
with a straight face.

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.563
The witness stand
is a lonely place to lie.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.365
We're gonna bring them into court

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:45.168
and they can tell that story
under cross-examination.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:46.502
Let's see if they can sustain it.

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.004
I don't think they can.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:54.610
State and federal authorities
have arrested

01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:58.581
55-year old Carl Ferrer
in Houston, this afternoon.

01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:01.217
Ferrer will face charges
related to pimping...

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:14.297
If Backpage is immune from liability,

01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:17.173
that has to mean that
this immunity actually

01:22:17.174 --> 01:22:19.702
extends to intentional criminal conduct.

01:22:20.703 --> 01:22:23.572
And the First Circuit actually
agrees with that argument.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:30.046
Perhaps, you know, the courtroom
isn't going to be the end-all be-all

01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:32.148
when it comes to solving this problem.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:34.950
Congress absolutely must act.

01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:36.285
Once we get the information,

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:38.587
pull back the curtain,
see what's really happening here,

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:42.025
then I think a legislative response
is the next logical step.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:45.579
I think you would see
a lot of opposition

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.330
to the idea of amending Section 230.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:52.035
The Center for Democracy and Technology,

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:54.003
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation,

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:57.740
two high-powered organizations
dedicated to internet freedom,

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.277
have both submitted legal
briefs supporting Backpage

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:04.113
in its cases against J.S. and Jane Doe.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:10.553
A Google search of donors to the
Center for Democracy and Technology

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:12.755
reads like a who's who
of tech companies.

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:18.161
Their larger donors include Facebook,
Microsoft and Google.

01:23:19.195 --> 01:23:21.630
Which means that funds
from these companies

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.699
are being used to support Backpage

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:27.236
in these cases involving
underage sex trafficking.

01:23:29.372 --> 01:23:33.742
Silicon Valley breaks out in a cold
sweat when we talk about amending CDA,

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.179
but there are ways that we could do this

01:23:36.279 --> 01:23:38.614
that could get at
the trafficking of children.

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:43.752
The government cannot just censor speech
that it disagrees with or dislikes.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:47.656
The money and the lobbies
are preventing any change,

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.093
even though it's a reasonable change,

01:23:50.193 --> 01:23:53.629
as if we're going to have to go to
the altar of the First Amendment,

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:55.231
and ask for forgiveness.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:57.733
Lots of votes taken,
but nothing has happened.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:01.170
So many people are not interested

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:04.573
in changing the laws
in regards to the internet.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.279
Whatever action needs to be
taken to address this problem,

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:11.347
needs to be taken.

01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:16.152
Now, if that requires amending
the Decency Act, then fine.

01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:17.153
I'll be glad to do it.

01:24:18.154 --> 01:24:20.589
They're just proceeding
a little bit too slowly.

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.533
Last night we issued a report.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.868
It showed evidence of criminal activity

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.539
and we had to spend 18 months and
go all the way to the Supreme Court

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.573
to get this information.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:47.611
More than 20 months ago,
this subcommittee

01:24:47.613 --> 01:24:49.519
launched a bipartisan investigation

01:24:49.618 --> 01:24:53.522
concerning how sex traffickers use
the internet to ply their trade.

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:56.592
Backpage.com sits at the center
of that online black market.

01:24:56.892 --> 01:25:00.296
Backpage refused to cooperate with
the subcommittee's investigation.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:01.697
They defied our subpoena,

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:04.333
failing to appear at
the November of 2015 hearing,

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.302
or provide the requested documents.

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:10.273
We'd now like to call our first panel
of witnesses for today's hearing.

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:13.842
It's the custom of this subcommittee
to swear in all witnesses.

01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:17.213
Do you swear that the testimony you are
about to give before this subcommittee

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:19.548
will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:20.783
so help you God?

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.551
Please be seated.

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:26.222
Last night, Chairman Portman and
I received word from Backpage

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:27.556
that in response to our report,

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:29.725
the company has shut down
its adult sections

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:32.328
across the United States
effective immediately.

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:35.464
I'm sure that was a pure coincidence.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.866
Only time will tell

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:40.703
if this action is just
a cheap publicity stunt.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:45.508
Backpage deliberately edited out words
indicative of child sex trafficking.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:49.345
"Fresh," "innocent," "school
girl" and even "Amber Alert."

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.780
Those children were still sold.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.781
Shame on you.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:56.185
Shame on you for hiding
behind the First Amendment.

01:25:56.419 --> 01:25:58.287
If an underage girl
is being sold for sex

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.556
and her pimp puts the word
"Lolita" in the advertisement,

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:01.890
stripping that term out of the ad

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.926
doesn't magically change
the girls age, does it?

01:26:04.026 --> 01:26:05.361
I decline to answer your question.

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:06.495
I decline to answer your question.

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:07.696
I decline to answer your question.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:11.700
Based on the rights provided by
the First and Fifth Amendments.

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.938
Mr. Lacey, am I to understand
from your responses

01:26:16.038 --> 01:26:17.806
you will invoke your
Fifth amendment right

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.409
in response to any and all
questions posed to you today?

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:21.344
Clearly.

01:26:23.246 --> 01:26:25.514
This concludes
the questioning of this panel.

01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:28.227
You are excused from
the panel based on your

01:26:28.228 --> 01:26:29.918
assertion of your
Fifth Amendment rights.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.222
You were at the hearing today,

01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:35.658
Backpage has pulled down
their escort site.

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:38.361
That was a publicity stunt
on Backpage's part.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:39.595
It was showmanship.

01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:40.696
I think it is a ruse.

01:26:41.664 --> 01:26:43.266
And the next Backpage
is gonna come along

01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:45.868
unless we fix the CDA.

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:05.488
How long will you be able
to keep the litigation going

01:27:05.588 --> 01:27:06.655
on your own resources?

01:27:06.789 --> 01:27:07.923
As long as it takes.

01:27:10.025 --> 01:27:12.928
Straight up, as long as it takes.
I can do this case.

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:14.597
You'll sell the furniture?

01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:15.831
I'll sell the furniture.

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:17.600
And I'll get a good price.

01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:39.021
Regardless of all the legalities
about what's permissible,

01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:40.689
the question is what's right.

01:27:43.792 --> 01:27:48.697
There is a question as to
what kind of society we're going to be,

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:52.768
whether we're going to tolerate
sexual trafficking in children.

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:56.271
That is an affront to
everything that we believe.

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:59.274
And that question for Backpage,
I think, is this.

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:02.845
Do you protect kids from trafficking

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:05.280
or do you profit from their suffering?

01:28:05.748 --> 01:28:06.882
That's the question.

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:11.854
How this could become part
of the legacy of The Village Voice

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.288
is depressing to me.

01:28:13.556 --> 01:28:16.459
This kind of operation would be exactly

01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:19.895
what the Voice would want to expose.

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:22.064
This company of adults

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:24.633
made the decision to post these pictures

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.670
without even taking the time
to find out if they were children.

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:30.275
They made a mistake
in allowing my daughter

01:28:30.276 --> 01:28:32.508
to be sold 20 times a day
on the website.

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.377
What if it was your daughter?

01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:36.812
How would you feel then?

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:47.890
M.A., J.S., and the other Jane Does

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.759
are standing up and
reclaiming their voices,

01:28:51.427 --> 01:28:52.861
not just for themselves

01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:55.330
but for thousands of other
children across the country,

01:28:56.632 --> 01:28:59.968
challenging a law that
has been interpreted so broadly

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:02.337
as to defy common sense,

01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:05.841
speaking out and fighting back.

01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:10.579
Demanding that we answer
that very question.

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:13.682
What kind of society do we want to be?

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:21.390
She was precocious,

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:23.959
nosy, opinionated.

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.863
Oh, my gosh,
she was bubbly and outgoing.

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:30.399
She always wanted to be
in the mix of everything.

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:35.571
What I love most about
my daughter is she has a big heart.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:37.973
I am Jane Doe.

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:39.708
I would say to my 12-year-old self,

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.645
"Don't settle for less because
you're a whole lot more than that.

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:43.846
I promise you."

01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:47.550
She just had a real spice for life.

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:51.554
Even with her being as broken as
she is, she shares so much love.

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:52.955
I am Jane Doe.

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:54.823
I am Jane Doe.

01:29:56.625 --> 01:29:59.962
She doesn't have to let what
has happened in her past hold her back.

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:03.432
I want my daughter
to hold her head high,

01:30:03.532 --> 01:30:06.802
and know that
none of this was her fault.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:09.772
Mothers are changing
this more than anything.

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.175
It's time for us all
to stand up and be strong.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:16.712
They're rescuing their kids,
taking to the streets.

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:18.581
They're taking these cases to court.

01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:21.049
This is often where
the real movements start.

01:30:21.484 --> 01:30:22.885
And that's the only way to make change,

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:24.620
is to make your voice known.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.188
I am Jane Doe.

01:30:27.656 --> 01:30:30.158
If I can talk to the other
Jane Does in this case,

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.928
I would tell them,
don't give up the fight.

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.031
They're paving the way for others.

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:39.167
I just don't want it
to happen to my sisters,

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.637
or your kids, or the next kid.

01:30:42.705 --> 01:30:46.642
I would say to the Jane Does,
you are giving voice to literally...

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.712
I don't know how many thousands,
I don't know how many.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.648
I am Jane Doe.

01:30:52.915 --> 01:30:54.182
I am Jane Doe.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.784
I am Jane Doe.

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:56.785
I am Jane Doe.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:58.821
I'm a sex trafficking survivor.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.155
I am Jane Doe.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.960
I am smart, I am beautiful.

01:31:05.561 --> 01:31:09.231
I'm strong, snappy, loving.

01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:10.699
I am a survivor.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:13.001
I am Jane Doe.
