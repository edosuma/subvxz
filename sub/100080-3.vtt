00:07.137 --> 00:08.704
Previously onSWAT...

00:08.747 --> 00:10.271
Pop! How long
you been staying here?

00:10.314 --> 00:11.446
About three weeks. You know,
just till I get my own place.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.838
HONDO:
I was always closer to my pop

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
than I was my mom.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.580
But when he left
and disappeared

00:15.624 --> 00:17.060
on my mom
just with no warning...

00:17.104 --> 00:19.019
My daddy is here with us.

00:19.062 --> 00:22.109
Hey, stranger.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.459
STREET:
That kiss. I thought that was

00:24.502 --> 00:26.069
a mutual moment that we had.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.072
Was I wrong?You and me, we're...
teammates.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
I'm always gonna
have your back on the job,

00:30.900 --> 00:32.554
but that's where it ends
from now on.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.686
Figure I'd pop out, help Molly
Hicks with something at her job.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.427
HONDO: You're kissing up to the boss's daughter now, Street?

00:36.471 --> 00:38.212
STREET:
No, it's nothing like that.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.127
Lieutenant Detective
Piper Lynch, Hollywood Division.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.476
The mayor has asked me
to personally

00:41.519 --> 00:42.607
run point
between the departments

00:42.651 --> 00:43.652
and make sure that we don't

00:43.695 --> 00:44.827
cross streams with the Feds.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.220
Lynch is a legend
in Hollywood Division.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.570
Lynch is here to take inventory.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.093
LYNCH:
I'm not here to tell you
how to do things.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.096
Just to reorient your thinking
about what SWAT can do.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.055
Conditioning is important.
So is training.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.318
It's what keeps officers alive.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.494
But maybe all of these great
cops can be put to better use

00:59.537 --> 01:03.324
in the field before
someone has to call 911.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.459
Yo! Breakfast is ready!

01:08.503 --> 01:10.157
Come on, now, both of you!

Waffles don't wait!

01:18.556 --> 01:20.819
We got the Chevy polished up

01:20.863 --> 01:22.560
good enough for first place
this weekend.

01:22.604 --> 01:25.172
If it wasn't
for that damn gas cap.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.695
Shame, that.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.392
Hey, it looks good since
I buffed the chrome on the cap.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.394
Yeah...Here, I hooked you up.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.962
Thanks. But it still
ain't the original.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.486
The judges take note
to that kind of detail.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.488
And if they don't, well,
the competition is sure

01:37.532 --> 01:38.620
to point it out to 'em.

01:38.663 --> 01:39.925
I thought those were
your homies.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.927
Yeah, well,
we all want to win.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.364
Well, you know, for $39.99
online, overnight shipping,

01:43.407 --> 01:44.843
it could be yours.

01:44.887 --> 01:47.759
Yeah, some reproduction
passed off as-as the original.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.370
I'm never buying something

01:49.413 --> 01:51.589
I can't see from somebody
I never met.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.592
Hey, trust only comes
face-to-face.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.420
I shouldn't have to
remind you of that, son.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.292
[door opens]Uh-oh.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.295
Your mama's early.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.253
Here come the fireworks.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.997
Hey, Mama.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.695
Hey.Let me make you a plate.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.436
Yeah, I-I'll move over
for you.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.264
Mm, no, no.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.875
I just came to drop off
some vitamins and supplements

02:16.919 --> 02:18.486
that you're supposed
to be taking.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.965
The instructions are
on the bottles.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.271
DANIEL: The boy can
read for himself.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.969
There's no reason
to treat him like a baby.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.058
The only baby at this table
is you, Daniel.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.713
You can't even keep
the schedule we agreed on

02:28.757 --> 02:30.628
for your visits.Of course I can.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.326
And it's nice
to see you, too,

02:32.369 --> 02:33.936
for a quick minute.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.247
Ma, that wasn't necessary.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.639
You're right.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.293
I didn't know
I had to call first

02:43.337 --> 02:44.990
to make sure I didn't have
to lay eyes on him.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.341
I thought we had
worked all of this out.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.175

to get what he wants.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.785
He's trying to find
his own place, Mama.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.003
It's just harder
than he thought.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.701
You're coming to
the car show, though, right?

02:59.744 --> 03:03.705
I didn't like his boys
back when they were boys.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.402
Marvis and that T-bird.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.448

to outdo each other.

in the waffles.

I want you to tell me
what you think, all right?

03:13.715 --> 03:15.630
I might take one to go.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.850
Don't you let that old man
pull one over on you.

You hear me?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.592
Yes, ma'am.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.466
He might seem soft,
but that's an act.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.164
The man is slippery as
a wet bar of soap.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.211
Here you go, Mama.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.996

03:43.048 --> 03:44.441
She's got her reasons, D.

03:44.485 --> 03:47.139
That's old history.
I mean, how long ago was that?

03:47.183 --> 03:48.358
I was 14.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.404
My sister Winnie,
she was about your age.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.319
You see her much
after you left?
Some.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.408
But, D, he's still my daddy.

03:54.451 --> 03:58.020
I loved him, I just didn't
like him very much for a while.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.239
But you let all that go.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.936

You can't be bitter
your whole life.

I thought I was supposed to be
the one dropping wisdom on you.

How does a non-SWAT lieutenant

04:28.616 --> 04:29.573
snag her own office at SWAT?

04:29.617 --> 04:30.966

here to observe and consult.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.537
She is not in
the chain of command.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.408
She cannot, does not
and will not issue orders

04:38.452 --> 04:40.367
to any of us, all right?

04:40.410 --> 04:41.498
Okay, here's a radical thought.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.152
Why don't we give her
half a chance?

04:43.195 --> 04:45.546
Maybe whatever changes
she's pushing

04:45.589 --> 04:48.592
might be an improvement.Is that some gender solidarity
I just heard?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.377
You're not always as funny
as you think, Street.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.378
Sometimes he's funnier.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.727
Not often, but sometimes.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.905
You know, get all the equipment

20:10.948 --> 20:12.776
and supplies for your boy.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.474
Takes money to make
money, ¿que no?

20:14.517 --> 20:17.085
RIVERA:
That cash is gonna
put us back on top.

20:17.128 --> 20:20.915
Mm. Not just in Los Angeles.
We're going nationwide.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.786
Bad news just got worse.

20:22.830 --> 20:23.961
RIVERA:
Since when?

20:24.005 --> 20:25.224
GOMEZ:
Soon as the money dries.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.966
See, this isn't just
a welcome-home party.

20:29.010 --> 20:32.013
It's a war party.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.371
CHARICE [nearby]:
All right, ladies.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.286
Good class today.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.114
See y'all next time.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.988
[chuckles]

20:51.032 --> 20:52.468
Babies making babies.

20:52.512 --> 20:56.037
Oh. Those are
some good girls.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.474
They're still doing
math on their fingers

20:58.518 --> 21:01.085
but the schools failed,
not the girls.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.958
Why are you here?

21:04.001 --> 21:06.700
Mama, you remember
how you always told me

21:06.743 --> 21:09.093
to never hold grudges?

21:09.137 --> 21:10.312
[scoffs] Did you
ever listen?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.705
[chuckles]
No, I did not,

21:11.748 --> 21:15.056
but it was good advice.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.318
Listen, uh,

21:16.362 --> 21:19.626
hating Pop...[clicks tongue, sighs]

21:19.669 --> 21:21.671
...it's not doing any of us
any good, including you.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.107
We can't change
the past, Mama.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.327
It doesn't mean
that you have to help the past

21:25.371 --> 21:27.634
keep repeating itself
all over again with Darryl.

21:27.677 --> 21:28.983
How you figure?

21:29.026 --> 21:31.551
That boy cannot rely
on his incarcerated father,

21:31.594 --> 21:33.770
he can't lean
on his useless mother,

21:33.814 --> 21:37.513
and he better not count on
that unreliable old man.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.169
Do you remember the day
your father left us?

21:41.212 --> 21:42.475
You know I do.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.346
You, Winnie, me.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.958
He rolled off
in that same blue Chevy.

21:48.002 --> 21:52.093
And you went running down
the street after him, crying.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.530
Remember how you felt?

21:54.574 --> 21:56.793
That was a long
time ago, Mama.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.535
Quitters quit,
that's a fact.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.799
Look, I just came here hoping
that you would consider

22:02.843 --> 22:04.671
coming to the
car show. Look...
Oh...

22:04.714 --> 22:06.237
Darryl and Pops have been
working real hard

22:06.281 --> 22:08.109
to get first place. They just
want to beat that T-bird.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.458
Like nothing ever happened.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.894
We just got old.

22:10.938 --> 22:13.680
Him, me, his homeboys.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.203
No, baby.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.770
Do it for Darryl.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.206
You mean do it for you.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.295
Yeah, okay.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.602
Do it for me, too.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.301
I'll think about it.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.091
Impressive.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.572
I could never
get the crosses.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.139
Or land the double
unders, either.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.402
Well, like anything else, it's,
uh, it's an acquired skill.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.404
Your dad left already.
Oh,

22:42.448 --> 22:44.319
no, I was just picking up
the Metro paperwork

22:44.363 --> 22:46.974
for this dependency
court case I've been assigned.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.193
Can I ask you something?

22:49.237 --> 22:50.717
Mm, I always want to say
no to that. [chuckles]

22:50.760 --> 22:51.848
Sure, what?

22:51.892 --> 22:54.808
Is Jim Street single?

22:55.852 --> 22:58.246
[exhales]
As far as I know.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.204
Is that a hundred percent?

23:00.248 --> 23:01.815
Aren't you worried
it could get a little messy

23:01.858 --> 23:03.469
with your dad?

23:03.512 --> 23:05.732
Maybe if I was 16 and it was
still any of his business.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.343
So you, you want me
to find out?

23:08.387 --> 23:09.997
Super discreetly.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.520
I get you.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.479
I mean, you're
friends with him.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.871
Am I kidding myself about this?

23:14.915 --> 23:18.832
No. I, I-I think you guys
would be great together.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.095
Thanks.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.231
[sighs]

23:27.275 --> 23:29.538
[phone ringing]

23:31.279 --> 23:32.585
That your burner?

23:32.628 --> 23:35.283
I'm not loving
the whole approach.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.024
Unless it works.
Lynch has a track record.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.376
[phone ringing]

23:41.420 --> 23:43.160
This is Marie.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.292
BOBBY:
Not really.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.554
Hey, Bobby.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.251
I'll be ready with
your payment tomorrow.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.602
Don't sleep in. The buyers
have me on a clock.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.386
What time?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.263
We won't get a lot of
grace before Los Altos

23:59.307 --> 24:00.917
know Little Angel's MIA.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.528
LYNCH: Don't
worry about it.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.312
Okay. Why not?

24:04.355 --> 24:06.314
Take a look.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.490
This went up on his social media
account two minutes ago.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.927
How?
I had it pulled
from his archives.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.886
We changed the time stamp,
reposted the photo,

24:12.929 --> 24:13.974
and here's Little Angel,
partying in the pool,

24:14.017 --> 24:15.497
present tense.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.195
When he doesn't check in,
this is what the OGs will find.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.894
Looking like he sneaked off
for some side fun.

24:23.679 --> 24:26.029
[starts engine]

24:35.517 --> 24:38.825
[honking horn]

24:46.354 --> 24:47.486
Okay, now, be smart.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.748
Don't pass too fast,

24:48.791 --> 24:50.314
don't pass
in your own area code.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.490
You don't want
the Secret Service

24:51.533 --> 24:53.448
to start smelling you.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.102
Bobby, drive-through fries
weigh more than this.

24:55.145 --> 24:56.495
A gram a piece for a C-note--

24:56.538 --> 24:59.106
mine or the treasury's--
comes to 5.291 ounces.

24:59.149 --> 25:02.588
You can count it if you want.

25:02.631 --> 25:07.506
So, there's good news
and bad news... Corbett.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.033
[grunts]Come on.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.121
[grunts]Get up.

25:14.164 --> 25:17.472
Ah, hell.
Listen...

25:17.516 --> 25:18.865
None of this was your idea.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.868
Los Altos forced you
back into business for them.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.086
They didn't give you a choice.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.435
But we haven't arrested you,
and we haven't

25:24.479 --> 25:25.828
read you your rights,
so what does that tell you?

25:25.872 --> 25:28.004
That you want me to flip?

25:28.048 --> 25:30.311
Which is a death
sentence in or out.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.443
You piss these guys off,
and they chop you into pieces

25:32.487 --> 25:35.229
and play soccer
with your head.That is an urban legend.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.361
Los Altos never had a retirement
plan for you, Corbett.

25:37.405 --> 25:38.580
We do.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.681
STREET: Just like that,
we got five million bucks.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.596
It's harder stealing cigarettes
in Long Beach.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.207
Don't get cocky, Street.
We ain't done.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.565
[engine starts]

26:26.759 --> 26:30.153
Conviction rate
with Secret Service: 98.8%.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.459
No agency does better.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.026
Let's run the numbers:

26:33.069 --> 26:36.159
possession of counterfeit
currency, 20 years max.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.640
Producing counterfeit,
20 max.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.425
Passing counterfeit,
15 max.

26:41.469 --> 26:44.167
Dealing counterfeit,
20 max.

26:44.211 --> 26:49.085
So 20, 40, 55...
75 years max.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.652
Like I don't already
know the numbers.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.958
How long you planning
on living?

26:52.001 --> 26:53.481
HONDO:
Or you can just
help yourself

26:53.524 --> 26:54.569
and do the right thing.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.701
Call your contact.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.616
Change the time and place
of the delivery.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.314
HONDO:
You're shook, man.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.403
Your protection's
gone missing.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.058
In custody down the hall,
at the moment.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.712
Officer Street will be
with you all the way.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.409
Two can die as easy as one.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.280
We're not gonna let anything
happen to either one of you.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.761
Except you're
already proven liars.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.502
Here's the when
and where.

27:14.545 --> 27:15.764
Make the call, man.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.558
[quietly]: "Trust me,"
said the spider to the fly.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.564
Corbett called. We're
done with him tonight.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.566
But the money
is primo, G.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.351
I mean, we could
keep him printing.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.658
Corbett owes us
for all the protection

27:39.701 --> 27:41.007
we gave him
back in Victorville.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.704
That's seven years
of gratitude.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.620
Mm. I don't know.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.275
No.
Something's off.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.493
Like what?

27:49.537 --> 27:50.669
Like I just have
a feeling, ¿entiendes?

27:52.235 --> 27:53.323
I don't trust him.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.716
Claro.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.458
Slow or fast?

27:57.501 --> 27:59.503
All those chemicals,
that paper...

27:59.547 --> 28:01.592
a man could burn up.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.420
Just can't look like a
homicide on the autopsy.

28:03.464 --> 28:04.900
So he's got to burn alive.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.336
So did Joan of Arc.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.732
Either way, make it
a clean sweep. All three.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.473
The girl, too?

28:12.516 --> 28:14.257
She's not a player.

28:14.301 --> 28:17.130
One, two, three. Yes.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.697
They all saw
the money.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.741
More bodies,
more risk.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.700
More witnesses,
more risk.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.323
Yeah, brother.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.460
LUCA:
Okay, that's Street,
inside our perimeter.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.593
All units flagged.
Three minutes, Commander.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.813
R Commander to 20-David.
You're on countdown.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.510
DEACON: Roger that.[knocks]

28:50.598 --> 28:51.773
Nervous?

28:51.817 --> 28:53.557
Only if I forget.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.776
Why test fate twice?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.343
Something happen?

28:56.386 --> 28:57.779
Not the point.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.650
20-David and 30-David
don't have a lot of cover

28:59.694 --> 29:01.609
in this parking lot,
if anybody looks.

29:01.652 --> 29:02.653
They're on it,
Lieutenant.

29:02.697 --> 29:03.872
This is what we do.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.795
Shame about all that money.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.275
Came out so good.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.798
It's not actually
money, Corbett.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.408
It's just a lot
of pretty paper

29:18.452 --> 29:20.454
about to be evidence.Against me.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.456
Against them.
You're a cooperating witness.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.850
No free pass, though?
For all my help?

29:24.893 --> 29:26.721
It's up to the prosecutor.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.811
Feds always go hard.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
I'd like to not die
in prison.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.076
I will settle for
not dying tonight.
Hey,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.992
you just stick to the script,
we'll be fine.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.828
Hmm. You know,
I got to say,

29:46.872 --> 29:48.612
this is the best part
of the job.[chuckles]

29:48.656 --> 29:50.484
Top of the roller coaster?

29:50.527 --> 29:51.659
Right before there's only
right now.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.186
Here we go.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.493
And paid every week
for the rush.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.537
[chuckles]

30:09.677 --> 30:12.114
[chatter in Spanish]

30:23.343 --> 30:24.866
Corbett...

30:24.910 --> 30:26.128
Where's your
new girlfriend?

30:26.172 --> 30:27.434
CORBETT:
I wish.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.044
She's too fine for me, Carlos.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.698
STREET:
There wasn't room in the van
for all three of us.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.657
[exhales]
Let's see the money.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.312
Yeah. Aged, wrapped and ready.

30:36.356 --> 30:37.879
No worries. [chuckles]STREET:
It's in the back.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.794
Four boxes, 110 pounds.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.767
[speaking Spanish]

30:58.900 --> 31:00.380
You could've let him
come by himself.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.470
It's my van, man.It's not your business.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.602
Dude needed wheels.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.389
Check him.
STREET:
Hey, hey, hey.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.825
I'm carrying, all right?
I'm carrying.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.349
I'm always carrying,
just like you, like all of you.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.742
What, now we need
to start wagging

31:14.785 --> 31:16.048
our weapons at each other?
Measure whose is bigger?

31:16.091 --> 31:18.659
I suggest you keep your hands
where he can see them.

31:18.702 --> 31:19.921
Whoa, every-everything okay?

31:19.965 --> 31:21.662
Yeah, with the money.
[speaks Spanish]

31:26.885 --> 31:28.582
24-David to 20-David.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.366
Money's going
into a silver Lexus.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.716
We're still on book.Put your hands up
or I shoot your friend.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.804
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:33.848 --> 31:35.545
Gun.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.983
24-David to 20-David.
Do we move?

31:38.026 --> 31:40.463
HONDO [over comms]:
Do not escalate the threat.

31:40.507 --> 31:41.900
Hold in place for my command.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.685
That's not the plan,
or you'd have done it already.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.644
You know, being a smartass
ain't always smart.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.646
Put them in the van.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.561
[Corbett grunts]

31:52.606 --> 31:54.521
[engine starts]

31:54.564 --> 31:56.958
[grunts]

31:57.002 --> 31:58.568
CHRIS: Hondo, he's got
the gun on Street.

31:58.612 --> 31:59.918
What do we do?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.484
HONDO: No one move
until his buddies are gone.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.746
Could get him killed.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.667
Your turn.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.582
Get in the van
with your friend.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.374
That wasn't a request.
Get in the van.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.160
I don't think so.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.470
Listen, listen.
Killing a cop

32:30.513 --> 32:32.037
is not gonna improve
your options.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.299
You?

32:33.342 --> 32:36.606
LAPD. Just put the gun down,

32:36.650 --> 32:39.348
stay alive,
make a deal.

32:39.392 --> 32:40.871
[gunshots]

32:40.915 --> 32:42.395
On your stomach!

32:42.438 --> 32:44.832
Police! Hands up!Throw it away!
Give me your hands!

32:44.875 --> 32:46.965
[overlapping shouting
over comms]

32:47.008 --> 32:48.357
STREET: Now!CHRIS: Show me your hands.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.185
Out of the car.Come on. Turn around.

32:50.229 --> 32:53.014
Front of the car,
on your knees.
CHRIS: Hands
behind your back.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.843
On your knees.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.285
TAN:
25-David, clear.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.200
CHRIS:
24-David, clear.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.723
HICKS: 20-David,
roadblock'll stop the truck.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.856
Intercept Gomez and the cash.
Silver sedan.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.336
Let's do this.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.950
GOMEZ:
Don't stop.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.440
Move in.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.977
Code 4.
All suspects in custody.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.805
Now you see how
the training pays off.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.155
Chris had the muscle memory
to make the shot.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.417
Lucky for Street.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.159
I know exactly
what it's like to look down

33:51.203 --> 33:53.770
the wrong side of a gun.
Street shouldn't have had to.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.859
I raised the risk level,
I am sorry for that.

33:57.035 --> 33:57.992
I'll write myself up

33:58.036 --> 33:58.993
in the after action report.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.212
Every time the teams roll,

34:00.255 --> 34:01.909
there's a risk.

34:01.952 --> 34:04.738
This was our best chance to take
Los Altos out of the game.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.001
For all our
bellyaching,

34:07.045 --> 34:08.307
the streets just got safer.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.786
You gonna
put in a word

34:09.830 --> 34:12.659
for Corbett, ma'am?
He came through for us.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.356
Sure.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.751
Thank you, sir. Ma'am.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.927
Do you want to place
a call to the mayor?

34:19.970 --> 34:21.537
She's waiting to hear.

34:21.581 --> 34:25.889
You told the mayor about an
undercover operation in advance?

34:25.933 --> 34:27.413
The mayor wasn't a threat
to the mission.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.589
She's a civilian.Oh, you start to think

34:29.632 --> 34:32.070
like that, you've been
in the bunker too long.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.159
I don't need
to talk to the mayor.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.464
With a police budget this year

34:35.508 --> 34:37.640
over a billion and a half
dollars?

34:37.684 --> 34:38.859
[sighs]

34:38.902 --> 34:40.904
Okay.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.732
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.567
I'm your friend, Commander.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.490
Hey. You and Chris
held it down out there.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.101
That was the fastest
descent I ever made.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.320
No damage when you hit?I'm still standing.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.714
Uh-huh. Don't skip
the ice tonight.It's going in my drink.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.019
DEACON: [chuckles]
I hear that.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.109
Gearheads, man.
Love a good quest,

35:11.152 --> 35:14.764
but chasing down a 50-year-old
Chevy OEM unvented gas cap?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.070
It's not so easy.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.898
Ah, thanks for trying
anyway, Luca.

35:17.941 --> 35:19.247
Mm.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.684
Here we go.
Oh, wait a minute.
No, you didn't.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.295
Are you kidding me?
What do I owe you, man?

35:23.338 --> 35:25.514
Eh, just everlasting gratitude.Oh, that's easy. Sold.

35:25.558 --> 35:28.300
Buddy of mine pulled it off his
own Chevy to loan your dad.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.128
Caps didn't change
till '72,

35:30.171 --> 35:32.913
so, historically, it's accurate
if the judges inspect.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.567
My guy came through.
Thank you, brother.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.090
Aw, yeah, yeah,
careful, careful.Oh, oh, my bad, my bad.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.831
You good?
It's all right.
Yeah, I'm all right.

35:37.874 --> 35:40.225
Oh, you did the damn thing.[laughs]

35:40.268 --> 35:42.923
That was, uh,
really dicey tonight.

35:42.966 --> 35:46.056
You know what?
It was actually kind of fun.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.494
Especially the not dying part.

35:48.537 --> 35:52.106
An OG with a gun in your face,
that-that's a bad moment.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.108
I saw you and Tan on the move.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.806
I just had to stall for a beat.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.025
I love your faith.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.245
How's Ty and Kira doing?

36:03.291 --> 36:07.034
Three people in a relationship
turns out to be geometry,

36:07.077 --> 36:08.035
not algebra.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.645
But, um,

36:09.689 --> 36:12.213
I'm trying to figure it out.So you're happy?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.041
That's a big word
for a short word.

36:14.084 --> 36:17.392
I am, um... I'm content.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.089
What about you?

36:19.133 --> 36:21.048
Are you still off
the dating apps?

36:21.091 --> 36:22.963
Oh, I'm done with the hustle.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.226
I'd told so many versions
of my life story,

36:25.270 --> 36:28.011
I wasn't even sure
who I was anymore.

36:28.055 --> 36:31.101
And by the way,
they all lie, too.
[chuckles]

36:31.145 --> 36:33.669
Fake finds fake.

36:35.932 --> 36:39.153
I'm just gonna let life come
to me from now on, you know?

36:40.894 --> 36:44.202
Like you're ready
for something serious?

36:44.245 --> 36:47.117
Or at least longer
than just a weekend.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.300
What, you can't get enough
of this place?

36:55.343 --> 36:57.432
Waiting for my dad.
It's our weekly steak night.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.304
Hey, uh,

36:59.347 --> 37:01.306
did you find anything out
about Jim?
Yeah.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.177
He's, uh, he's single for sure.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.657
You didn't...I didn't mention you, no.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.833
Um, I think you should
ask him out.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.138
You make it sound easy.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.749
Can be.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.185
Alonzo.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.232
She tell you she and Tan
saved Street's life today?

37:14.275 --> 37:15.581
No.

37:15.624 --> 37:16.843
Wasn't as dramatic
as it sounds.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.454
Okay. [chuckles]
It was good work, Chris.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.805
Squared away.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.851
Thank you, sir.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.292
[indistinct chatter]

37:33.207 --> 37:34.426
DANIEL:
That's good.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.558
Just in time, Pop.

37:36.602 --> 37:40.083
Original equipment
manufacturer. Boom.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.999
I'm not gonna ask what you
had to do to get this,

37:43.043 --> 37:44.044
but I approve.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.220
You're welcome, Pop.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.614
You go put it on, D.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.151
30 seconds
to lay down your tools.

38:04.194 --> 38:07.241
Last entry in the competition,
20 seconds.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.200
Ineligible
in 15 seconds.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.463
Marcus, look at you.

38:11.506 --> 38:14.683
Still bossing everybody around.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.207
Some things just never change.
I'm amazed you can

38:17.251 --> 38:19.340
squeeze all that good living
behind the wheel

38:19.384 --> 38:21.690
of your T-bird.[both chuckle]

38:21.734 --> 38:22.952
Charice.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.172
Mm-hmm. None other.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.783
You always did know how to make
an impression on all of us.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.264
I never even tried.You didn't have to.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.964
You got her to come.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.966
Did you even
ask me first?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.186
Oh, please, Pop,
don't act like you mind.

38:39.229 --> 38:42.668
No, no, no, no. You need
to stay here by the car.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.104
Saboteurs everywhere.

38:44.147 --> 38:47.107
Hey, Pop, be nice.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.109
I'm serious.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.328
Marcus.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.505
Where's my number?

38:53.548 --> 38:55.115
Thank you.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.727
Time! Entries are closed.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.731
It's good to see you, Charice.Mm-hmm.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.735
You talk to him,
but not to me?

39:06.779 --> 39:09.216
I talk to you.As little as possible.

39:09.259 --> 39:10.304
[sighs]

39:11.653 --> 39:13.263
I'm glad you came.

39:13.307 --> 39:16.266
You're not the reason why.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.312
Hey, baby.

39:20.793 --> 39:21.924
Well, at least
they're breathing

39:21.968 --> 39:22.925
the same airspace.
That's progress.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.666
[Darryl laughs]

39:24.710 --> 39:26.276
You came!

39:26.320 --> 39:28.714
Yes, I came.[both chuckle]

39:28.757 --> 39:31.151
Look at this work
you done put in.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.414
Thank you, Mama.My baby.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.938
This car looks almost brand-new.Hey, listen,

39:35.982 --> 39:38.854
the judges not gonna get
to my car for another hour.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.378
Might want
to take a ride.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.293
Just around the block.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.906
Maybe once around the block
if I'm driving.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.475
Come on, Darryl.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.520
Eh...

39:52.564 --> 39:54.696
You thought I was taking you?
[laughs]

39:56.568 --> 39:58.134
Yeah, go ahead, get in the car.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.922
[engine starts]

40:02.965 --> 40:05.141
Now, remember,

40:05.185 --> 40:06.708
be careful on the corners.

40:06.752 --> 40:10.408
I remember.
I remember everything.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.511
Your mother's a hard woman.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.513
I appreciate that about her.

40:28.556 --> 40:29.862
You're hopeless, Pop.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.167
Not at all.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.474
This just might be
the year I win.

40:35.868 --> 40:39.524
She is gonna bring
that thing back, right?

40:39.567 --> 40:41.526
