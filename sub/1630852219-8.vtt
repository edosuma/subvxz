00:49.280 --> 00:51.480
- Guys.
- Hey, Vocabulary.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.960
Guys...

00:58.040 --> 01:00.760
Here to inspect the sugar factory?

01:03.480 --> 01:06.760
We adulterate it, only 25% is shit.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.040
That's better than the rest.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.800
Some people even put rat poison in it,
but we are purists.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.960
- Only phenacetin.
- This is good stuff.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.560
The market agrees with you.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.000
- Do you hear that?
- We're working our asses off.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.640
- We're done. Let's go, I'm starving.
- You always want to eat.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.520
- Enzo, what's the matter?
- Nothing, we have to go.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.160
- Come with me.
- Keep it up, guys.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.160
- Carmela, how are you?
- Fine.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.000
- Was the camera turned on?
- Yes, the police took the footage.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.400
- Did you see who it was?
- No, I couldn't see his face.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.920
The police said it was a warning.
It wasn't a big bomb.

02:08.039 --> 02:12.080
- But the next time it's serious.
- What did you tell them?

02:12.200 --> 02:16.520
If they do their job, like I do
every night, there will be no next time.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.880
I'll see you later.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.520
This bomb is from the Federation,
I'm sure of it.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.600
But they can't think we're afraid now.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.800
We can't stop now,
we almost have them.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.760
We have to kill 'em
and roll 'em up in bags.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.880
We have to hit them now,
it doesn't matter who.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.680
We just need to kill one now.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.120
- Speak to me, Ciro.
- I just got the news.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.240
- I need to see you right away.
- Where?

02:53.360 --> 02:56.360
- I'll meet you at the warehouse.
- Okay.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.440
We are your brothers.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.440
We're done here.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.560
Come with me.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.360
What did he say?

03:15.560 --> 03:16.960
Nothing.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.560
But I know him well.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.080
In is heart, he's furious.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.880
Then that bomb can work in our favor.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.480
Are you sure?

03:35.640 --> 03:39.920
If they go nuts at the Federation now,
they'll do a lot of damage.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.000
Unless they crash into a tree
and the Federation stays intact.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.720
I turned Enzo into a soldier...

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
but now he has to become a capo.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.160
He has to learn
to think before he shoots.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.200
Only then we can win this.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.480
If you're 20 years old,
shooting is easier than thinking.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.560
I know.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.320
That's why I have to talk to him.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.240
Alone.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Translated by: NederSubs

05:27.000 --> 05:30.080
Do you know why the Federation
planted that bomb?

05:31.520 --> 05:35.200
They think we're nobody,
but that isn't true.

05:35.320 --> 05:40.560
But they have to keep thinking that.
We must keep our nerve.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.440
When we're done,
we're going to kill them.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.800
Do you mean I shouldn't do anything?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.760
You do as I say, when I say it.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.080
First, you have to reorganize your men.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.280
How do you mean?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.880
It won't work if everyone thinks
they're the boss.

06:11.920 --> 06:15.400
If you want to win the war,
there can only be one leader.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.360
And that's you.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.720
Let me ask you something.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.720
Shoot.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.760
What's in this for you?

06:38.560 --> 06:42.960
- 20 percent, as always.
- That's not much.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.400
If everything goes well, I'll get Forcella.
What are you doing this for?

06:48.520 --> 06:51.320
I'm doing the only thing I'm good at.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.040
But whatever I do,
the spirits won't leave me alone.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.880
- Guys, we need to get ready.
- We'll destroy them.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.880
Yes, we will.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.880
- But it's not that straightforward.
- How do you mean?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.960
I have a plan.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.960
We must weaken the Federation first.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.360
If you follow my lead,
we can wipe them away.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.840
And then we're the boss
in our own neighborhood.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.120
Sounds good, but I think
we no longer decide together.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.320
You are the boss now, aren't you?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.600
We're sailing towards the storm.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.160
There is only one captain on the ship.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.880
That was the case for the generation
before us. My dad died for it.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.920
But we see things differently.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.800
We don't let anyone tell us what to do.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.520
To win the war,
we'll have to change things.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.720
And when we change things, we'll win.
I promise.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.159
So you are Enzo Blue Blood.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.840
Do you have that name for me?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.240
This is from Gennaro.

08:56.360 --> 09:01.880
This is the contact, we already
talked to him. He's expecting your call.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.400
But you have to give him something.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.440
That's not a problem.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.200
I still don't know your name.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.200
Patrizia.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.560
It was a pleasure, Patrì.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.840
Leave it to me.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.520
Good.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.200
And?

10:09.320 --> 10:11.760
- The kid showed up.
- Great.

10:12.840 --> 10:18.600
Something else: tell Cianel
to spend all her cash on weapons.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.200
Is this a joke?

10:22.240 --> 10:26.280
Should I hypnotize her, or what?
She's not a part of your war.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.520
Make it clear
she's either for or against me.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.120
And what if she's against you?
What do I do?

10:41.360 --> 10:44.120
Then you let her pay the price.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.200
This is not acceptable, clear?
Or should I cram you in it?

11:41.440 --> 11:43.760
And now get the hell out.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.600
What a mistake to hire those losers.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.680
They work hard
and they don't bother us...

11:53.800 --> 11:55.760
but this is about decency.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.680
How the hell can I bury someone
in a red-lined coffin?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.840
It's a matter of respect.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.320
What is it?

12:08.280 --> 12:12.000
The war Genny wants to wage
with those people from downtown...

12:12.120 --> 12:13.840
That's not a joke.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.720
It's real, and he's going to start now.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.880
What do you think of it?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.800
They called us monkeys.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.760
It's time to show them
nobody puts these monkeys in a cage.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.320
They should wash out their mouths
with soap before they can talk to you.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.360
Well said.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.200
Come in.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.920
This is a gift for you.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.880
- Hello, Cocò.
- How are you, Catenella?

14:14.000 --> 14:19.200
- Not bad, and you?
- Okay. I have some good stuff for you.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.320
Good stuff, great class.

14:22.480 --> 14:27.160
Your Myriam would love it.
And the price is really good.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.720
If it's good and cheap stuff,
I can't refuse.

14:30.840 --> 14:35.760
- Do I see you in half an hour?
- I never turn down a great deal...

14:35.880 --> 14:40.160
but half an hour is too short.
I have to discuss with Myriam first.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.240
They want money straightaway.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.440
That's why the price is so reasonable.

14:49.240 --> 14:53.000
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll surprise Myriam with it.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.440
Well done.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.080
He's on his way.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.240
Don't move.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.800
Let me go.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.880
Stand up.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.200
Sit still, for fuck's sake.
Don't move.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.960
Piece of shit.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.560
We know you're buying weapons
for the Federation.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.640
We want to know where you store them.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.400
What are you doing?

16:42.520 --> 16:46.160
You are puppies
challenging Neapolitan Mastiffs.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.280
They'll tear you apart alive.

16:59.360 --> 17:04.440
He's like an old washing machine:
hit it a few times and it works again.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.800
We are not puppies, you are.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.760
You have a boss.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.920
Kill me.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.520
Kill me, but I can't tell you.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.040
- Ronni, everything alright?
- Certainly.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.240
Look who's here.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.640
I'm looking at his daughter Myriam.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.200
She doesn't look like her father,
a real sweetie.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.640
And that kid is also cute.
I'll show him to you.

17:49.440 --> 17:54.040
Do you see that kid on that bike?
And that's his mother.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.720
I wouldn't like to hurt her...

17:58.200 --> 17:59.880
What do you think?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.120
See? Puppies bite as well.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.080
Please...

18:11.840 --> 18:14.360
My family has nothing to do with this.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.360
You can decide that yourself.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.960
And? What should I tell my buddy?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.920
What do I say to him?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.440
There are three stashes.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.560
The hotel near the train station...

18:43.400 --> 18:45.640
the cemetery in Chiaiano...

18:45.760 --> 18:48.720
and the flag factory in Via Marina.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.480
Well done.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.160
You did the right thing.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.920
Are you coming along?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.440
We know where the weapons are.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.800
Good. Then we can start biting.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.840
Are we going to screw over
that asshole Arenella right away?

19:29.320 --> 19:33.880
Arenella is a real son of a bitch,
but he is cold-blooded.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.520
We better go for Crazy.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.920
He's stupid, and very short-tempered.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.200
And the Capaccios have too few men
to defend their place.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.160
We hit them at a place
where they can't hit us back right away.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.320
Then we do real damage.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.680
To bite hard, we need teeth.
And we're short of those.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.360
You don't have to worry about that.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.720
I have a present for you.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.600
You made the right choice, Blue Blood.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.400
There was no other choice.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.880
Tell me, kiddo...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.280
Can you handle these toys?

21:02.400 --> 21:05.880
Don't you worry.
I will get you many customers.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.040
Hopefully we aren't leaving these toys
in the hands of children.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.360
Do you know why they call Ciro
the Immortal?

21:31.480 --> 21:34.440
Because he survived three wars?

21:36.120 --> 21:40.800
When he was 21 days old,
his parents died in an earthquake.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.320
He was the only survivor
of the 30 residents.

21:47.800 --> 21:52.160
If you think you are the earthquake
that will kill him, I'll find you.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.960
Like yourself, I'm a son of a king...

21:58.840 --> 22:01.760
but just like Ciro,
I grew up being an orphan.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.600
We are sons of spirits,
our fathers were slaughtered,

22:06.720 --> 22:10.360
and the Federation didn't even
give us back their bodies.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.400
So you only want revenge?

22:15.600 --> 22:18.880
I want what they took away from us
and what I deserve:

22:19.000 --> 22:20.960
I want Forcella.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.920
Then you'll get Forcella.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.920
But if you get hungry afterwards...

22:37.040 --> 22:38.600
I'll rip your heart out.

23:06.760 --> 23:12.400
As far as I'm concerned, he's your
responsibility, because he chose you.

23:12.520 --> 23:16.520
Everything that happens to him
should also happen to you. Clear?

23:28.880 --> 23:30.360
Hurry up.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.960
Lift it off.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.120
And this one too.
Put it against the wall.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.080
Dig in.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.320
- Holy shit.
- Santa has come.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.600
You know what to do.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.880
- Have you ever had a weapon?
- No.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.040
Take this one.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.200
Who are you again?

24:43.360 --> 24:45.280
The people who are letting you live.

24:45.400 --> 24:50.280
- Get lost, this is not your terrain.
- You didn't understand.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.600
You're a herding dog now
and I'm the shepherd.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.800
Goodbye.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.080
Guys, let's move on.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.440
Alright. Bye.

25:23.600 --> 25:28.600
Those beards took over
our parking lot and the Torri Bar.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.880
We have to teach them a lesson.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.800
- They must die.
- Wait.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.760
Wait until
they've taken over everything?

25:39.440 --> 25:42.400
Maybe they have a strategy.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.720
- What do you mean?
- Why do you never think?

25:46.720 --> 25:51.600
They've done this right under our noses.
So they're either really stupid...

25:51.720 --> 25:54.480
or they're keeping us on a leash.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.040
We are not dogs,
we're strong enough to destroy them.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.560
Pick up the weapons.
I'll see you in an hour. Hurry up.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.320
- What's taking them so long?
- No idea.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.240
We've been here for two hours.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.440
There they are.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.000
Where are they going?

26:56.120 --> 26:58.680
- Wait.
- Where did he go?

27:18.880 --> 27:20.280
Now.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.560
Close it.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.760
We have them.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.000
Come on, hurry up.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.800
Hurry up.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.200
Drive.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.880
Quiet, don't move.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.520
There's nobody here.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.600
Are they dead?

28:40.040 --> 28:42.880
What are you talking about? Come on.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.040
Take this.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.560
Stop dreaming, come with me.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.520
Hand it to me.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.960
They have all weapons
and almost all lives.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.520
We have to call the Slave for weapons.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.440
And new men, Romeo must help us.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.520
He also benefits from this.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.240
They'll go after him as well.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.520
We'll give 5000 euros
to everyone who joins us.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.800
We form an army, cut off their dicks
and cram them in their mouths.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.240
That requires more than just an army.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.400
Don't you see what happened?

30:44.360 --> 30:47.640
We had more people and weapons
and it still happened.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.320
What should we do then,
according to you?

30:52.000 --> 30:56.560
We let them believe that they have won,
that they're stronger.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.040
That we're shitting ourselves
and don't fight back.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.520
We wait a few hours so they'll relax...

31:09.160 --> 31:12.680
and then we'll send them to God
to ask for forgiveness.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.200
What's going on? Where is Enzo?

32:08.320 --> 32:11.120
Don't worry, Enzo knows what he's doing.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.040
- Everything okay?
- It's suspiciously quiet.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.560
What do we do now?

32:23.680 --> 32:26.960
We go home,
but first we send a message.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.480
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

34:05.320 --> 34:08.800
- Maria saw strangers in our neighborhood.
- What do we do?

34:11.960 --> 34:13.719
Go and see, Valerio.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.920
You wanted to see me?

34:20.040 --> 34:22.800
I heard your boys have been busy.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.159
- What do you think?
- You know what you're doing.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.520
You gave me this business
and I work hard.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.320
If you join me,
this is only the beginning.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.639
- But now I need something else from you.
- What?

34:37.880 --> 34:40.600
30 percent of your revenue.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.120
I need it to win this war.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.960
I'll make sure you'll get back
three times the amount.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.360
Do you see this coffin?

34:53.440 --> 34:56.040
Nice, huh? I keep him for myself.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.040
But I only go in when I'm very old.

35:01.160 --> 35:06.320
Whatever you want. But in the meantime,
we scored big points with the angels.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.080
What do you mean?

35:11.360 --> 35:14.040
You want the Capaccio's place?

35:14.160 --> 35:16.520
After this war, it's yours.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.120
We'll build a beautiful statue there.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.240
Do you know what they say?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.000
The biggest whore

35:23.120 --> 35:27.840
is the one who gives you lice
and then fucks you again.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.360
You do that too.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.880
Excuse me, I'm lost.
How do I get to Via Foria?

35:51.880 --> 35:54.240
Fuck off back to Vomero.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.640
Sorry.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.520
What are you doing?
You said you'd only look.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.760
You take this.
Come on, we have to go.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.400
Put this on.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.600
Hurry up.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.320
Go on.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.880
Done?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.480
We have to split up.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.040
Go home.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.640
- Everything okay?
- Everything okay.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.880
- Go to bed.
- Take care.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.280
Bye, sweetie.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.120
- How are you?
- I'm still alive. What's up?

38:08.240 --> 38:12.640
Maria told me who your new friend
from Secondigliano is.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.440
Where are you going?

38:17.640 --> 38:19.040
Look at me.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.080
Was that friend with you tonight?

38:23.880 --> 38:26.000
- Was he with you?
- No.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.640
Why not?

38:30.040 --> 38:32.400
He supplies the weapons and the drugs.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.520
Thanks to him,
those assholes are now afraid.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.320
I get it.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.000
He is the choreographer and you dance.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.400
If something goes wrong,
they'll come for you.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.440
That's not how it went.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.200
And if we win this war, then what?

38:49.320 --> 38:55.160
Does he get paid for the choreography,
or does he buy the whole theater?

38:55.280 --> 38:57.840
He's my brother.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.840
I'll tell you what I told everyone:

39:01.960 --> 39:05.200
If you're not for me, you're against me.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.640
I've heard about your exam.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.840
Valerio, you can do whatever you want...

40:05.880 --> 40:08.240
but you have to get your diploma.

40:43.280 --> 40:48.160
- What do we do?
- Inform the families, we'll go on tomorrow.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.560
They are the devil.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.360
What are you laughing at?

41:04.480 --> 41:07.800
They're destroying us,
what's so funny about that?

41:07.920 --> 41:09.320
Yes, laugh.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.000
They're stone cold.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.440
We can do two things:

41:19.560 --> 41:23.120
We can exterminate them,
or we can invite them over.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.960
Either way, it will be fun.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.200
NEXT TIME

43:37.305 --> 43:43.704
