THE CAKEMAKER

01:42.280 --> 01:46.400
Kredenz Cafe & Bakery

02:06.230 --> 02:07.360
Good morning.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
Good morning. Hello.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.580
How are you?

02:13.610 --> 02:16.570
- Good, and you?
- Good, thank you.

02:16.690 --> 02:18.780
Every time I come to Berlin,

02:18.820 --> 02:22.860
this is the first place I visit
because of your cookies.

02:23.860 --> 02:26.070
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:26.150 --> 02:29.320
What do you recommend today?

02:31.320 --> 02:35.440
Here we have a raisin pastry,
on the left,

02:35.530 --> 02:38.690
and we have poppy seed pastries,
but you don't like those.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.690
True.

02:40.730 --> 02:43.820
This is a classic fresh
Black Forest cake,

02:43.860 --> 02:45.980
here in the middle.

02:51.110 --> 02:54.070
- Should I explain in English?
- No.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.320
I trust you.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.360
I'll take this one,
a double espresso,

03:00.400 --> 03:03.450
and a box
of your cinnamon cookies.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.610
- Cinnamon cookies.
- My wife loves them.

03:05.730 --> 03:08.650
- Ok. You may sit.
- Thank you.

03:31.650 --> 03:32.860
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.030
- For your wife.
- Thank you.

04:25.780 --> 04:28.110
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

04:29.070 --> 04:32.070
Can I ask you something?

04:32.150 --> 04:35.280
My son in Israel,
it's his birthday

04:35.360 --> 04:40.400
and I don't have a clue
what to get him.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.650
Do you have an idea
for a typical German present?

04:49.860 --> 04:51.980
- How old is your son?
- 6 years old.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.150
What are you doing here
in Berlin?

04:56.070 --> 04:58.150
I work for
an Israeli-German company.

04:58.190 --> 05:00.400
City planning, trains.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.730
I know a toy store that
specializes in trains from steel,

05:09.570 --> 05:12.650
they build and paint them
by hand.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.980
- Maybe you get him a small train.
- That's a good idea.

05:18.030 --> 05:20.110
Maybe you can come with me?

05:20.150 --> 05:24.150
It would be nice to be guided
by a real Berliner.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.400
I'm not a real Berliner, but...

05:32.610 --> 05:34.690
sure, I can take you there.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.650
ONE YEAR LATER

06:36.070 --> 06:37.230
Tai Tai!

06:38.320 --> 06:41.360
Yes, sweetie, it's your father.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.480
How are you?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.400
Yes?

06:47.570 --> 06:49.650
How was school today?

06:49.780 --> 06:53.690
Are you a good boy?
Not causing your mother any trouble?

06:53.730 --> 06:55.820
I'll be back on Thursday.

06:57.070 --> 07:01.110
I'll pick you up from school,
and we'll go for pizza.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.190
Okay, sweetie, me too.

07:05.230 --> 07:07.480
I love you very, very much.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.610
Let me talk to your mother.

07:15.650 --> 07:16.860
Hey, how are you?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.900
A bit tired, that's all.

07:24.070 --> 07:26.070
Okay, fine.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.280
Bye.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.360
Why didn't you call me?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.360
It wasn't planned.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.440
How long are you staying?

07:36.480 --> 07:38.530
Two days.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.730
When are you coming back?

07:42.780 --> 07:44.860
Beginning of December.

07:47.070 --> 07:50.030
I brought the cookies
for your wife.

07:51.110 --> 07:53.230
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.480
When was the last time?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.610
Thursday.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.570
Where?

08:06.730 --> 08:08.780
At home,

08:08.940 --> 08:11.820
on the bed.

08:13.070 --> 08:15.110
What did you do?

08:18.190 --> 08:20.320
I laid her down,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.440
then I kissed her.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.730
Where exactly?

08:31.780 --> 08:33.860
On the neck,

08:34.820 --> 08:35.980
mouth,

08:37.860 --> 08:39.070
eyes.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.610
One month.

10:09.570 --> 10:12.730
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.860
Please leave a message
at the tone.

10:16.980 --> 10:20.040
Oren, it's me.
You're probably on the plane.

10:20.070 --> 10:23.150
You forgot your cookies
and your keys here.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.360
I'll see you soon.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.650
Please leave a message
at the tone.

11:01.780 --> 11:05.820
Oren,
I've called you a couple of times,

11:05.980 --> 11:08.980
I don't know
when you're coming back.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.230
Just call me back.

11:23.690 --> 11:27.730
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable,

11:27.820 --> 11:29.820
Please leave a message...

12:07.480 --> 12:08.620
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:08.650 --> 12:11.650
I'm looking for Oren.
Is he here?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.940
I'm from Cafe Kredenz,
I must deliver this.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.980
Oren isn't here.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.150
Where is he?

12:21.030 --> 12:23.230
He doesn't work here anymore.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.440
Did he quit?

12:26.320 --> 12:29.370
He ordered this,
and I was in the area

12:29.400 --> 12:32.480
so I wanted to give it to him.

12:33.650 --> 12:36.650
I just want to know
where he is.

12:36.730 --> 12:38.780
Please.

12:39.780 --> 12:42.900
I can't really talk about this.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.070
There was an accident
in Jerusalem,

12:47.150 --> 12:51.360
his office told us
almost six weeks ago.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.400
That's all we know.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.690
Oren was killed.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.610
Sweetheart.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.780
You're not cold anymore?

14:30.360 --> 14:33.530
Change of personal status,
Married / Divorced...

14:34.480 --> 14:36.480
Widowed

14:37.480 --> 14:38.650
That's all.

14:38.730 --> 14:42.900
You bring it to the municipality
with your ID and passport,

14:42.940 --> 14:44.950
you sign it, and that's it.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.860
Okay.

14:46.980 --> 14:49.110
It needs to be done.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.400
I'm going back to the Cafe
on Sunday.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.400
What about Itai?

14:57.440 --> 15:01.650
I'll leave work early
to pick him up,

15:01.690 --> 15:05.650
Dana will help me out.
It'll be fine.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.980
Just don't exert yourself.

15:12.070 --> 15:13.980
Okay.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.570
Are you coming for Shabbat?

15:29.690 --> 15:31.820
We'll come next week.

15:32.730 --> 15:33.820
Okay?

15:33.940 --> 15:35.860
Okay.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.940
We'll talk tomorrow.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.030
Thank you, Motti.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.650
Sorry I'm late,
the bus drove off without stopping.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.730
I had to wait for the next one.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.900
Never mind.

16:49.150 --> 16:51.280
Do you have some Pastrami?

16:51.360 --> 16:53.400
What's up, Avram?

16:54.280 --> 16:56.440
Thank God. How are you?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.650
Okay.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.859
Salami? Pork?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.819
Pork? Come on...

17:10.069 --> 17:11.980
Here.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.230
So that you won't open
without a Kosher certificate.

17:14.280 --> 17:18.280
Thank you, I forgot that
the one we have is outdated.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.480
It's okay, Motti told me.

17:23.650 --> 17:25.730
Have a good week
and a good month.

17:26.530 --> 17:29.860
Thanks. I'd offer you coffee,
but I still didn't clean the machine...

17:29.900 --> 17:31.940
- I already had one.
- Okay.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.030
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

17:35.070 --> 17:37.070
Goodbye.

17:43.440 --> 17:48.530
Cafe Paamon
is hereby approved Kosher

19:57.280 --> 19:59.230
Hello.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.030
Good morning.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.980
What would you like?

20:20.070 --> 20:23.280
- Double expresso, please.
- Something to eat, maybe?

20:24.150 --> 20:25.360
What do you have?

20:25.750 --> 20:32.650
Shakshuka, tomato sauce with
eggs inside or soup

20:32.690 --> 20:34.820
and sandwiches.

20:35.610 --> 20:40.030
- What kind of sandwiches?
- Sfatit. Israeli white cheese.

20:40.980 --> 20:44.040
Sandwich with omelette,
herbs, cucumbers.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.070
- Very good.
- Sounds good.

20:46.110 --> 20:48.230
I'll have the sandwich.
Thank you.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.320
Thank you.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.320
- Where are you from?
- From Germany.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.530
- Where in Germany?
- Berlin.

21:24.730 --> 21:27.730
- Welcome to Jerusalem.
- Thank you.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.900
- Everything ok?
- Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.

22:17.690 --> 22:19.900
- How much is it?
- 25.

22:20.860 --> 22:21.980
25...

22:22.110 --> 22:25.070
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

22:26.230 --> 22:29.230
I was wondering if you need
a worker here.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.320
- No. Not right now.
- Ok. Thank you.

22:47.940 --> 22:51.070
Hebrew Youth Swimming Pool

24:50.820 --> 24:52.070
I'm off.

24:52.900 --> 24:57.120
There is soup on the stove,
take it off in ten minutes.

24:57.150 --> 24:59.330
Are you picking Itai up
at 13:00?

24:59.360 --> 25:02.440
No, I have a class at 12:00,
I told you on Wednesday.

25:02.490 --> 25:05.490
- I forgot.
- Sorry.

25:06.490 --> 25:08.610
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.610
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:10.650 --> 25:12.740
- Have a good time, Dana.
- Thanks.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.400
Hi. Motti?

25:28.400 --> 25:29.570
No, everything's fine.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.690
Could you pick Itai up
at 13:00?

25:32.740 --> 25:34.650
Oh...

25:34.740 --> 25:36.900
Okay. I'll manage.

25:37.780 --> 25:40.820
I'll close for an hour
or something.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.110
Okay.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.150
Alright.

25:45.150 --> 25:48.150
So I'll see you later. Bye.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.860
You're still looking for a job?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.990
Yes.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.110
Okay.

26:13.150 --> 26:16.320
- Can you wash dishes?
- Sure.

26:17.490 --> 26:20.610
Good. I need someone
to wash dishes 2-3 times a week,

26:20.650 --> 26:25.690
in the mornings and help out
with errands, cleaning up a bit,

26:25.740 --> 26:28.740
cutting vegetables, things like that.

26:28.780 --> 26:31.070
- You're interested?
- Yeah.

26:31.990 --> 26:36.070
Ok. So, I can pay you
25 shekels an hour.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.320
- You can start tomorrow.
- At what time?

26:40.320 --> 26:41.490
6:30.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.070
Hey.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.490
- How are you?
- Okay.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.360
Yeah? Let me see you.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.780
Listen, Aviva caught me
on the way out.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.860
She said
he's shutting himself off.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.960
Maybe you should talk to her.

27:47.990 --> 27:49.190
Fine.

27:49.990 --> 27:51.120
Who's that?

27:51.150 --> 27:53.240
A student, he works here.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.210
- Where is he from?
- He's German.

27:56.240 --> 28:00.400
Of all the places in the world,
you bring a German into your kitchen?

28:00.490 --> 28:03.610
Two phone calls and I could find you
ten new workers.

28:03.650 --> 28:06.860
What do you want? It works for me.
What's the problem?

28:06.900 --> 28:08.940
He's German.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.070
Come on, stop it.

28:11.860 --> 28:15.150
- He's right here, that's not nice.
- It's okay, he doesn't hear us.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.940
- I'll see you.
- Okay, thank you.

28:33.570 --> 28:35.570
Here you go.

28:36.650 --> 28:38.650
Did you get any homework?

29:46.530 --> 29:48.490
- Hey.
- Hallo.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.790
Can you stay today
for a few more hours?

29:56.820 --> 29:58.940
- Two or three maybe?
- Okay.

30:03.190 --> 30:07.280
Today my son has his birthday
so I have like a million things to do

30:08.360 --> 30:10.570
and I don't know
how I'm going to manage.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.690
Okay, you know what?

30:17.820 --> 30:23.030
I need you to do this for me: You take
the pepper and you cut all around here.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.790
Take it all off,
but be careful they don't break

30:25.820 --> 30:28.070
because I'm going
to fill them up afterwards,

30:28.860 --> 30:31.030
and pull it out. Okay?
Clean a little,

30:31.070 --> 30:33.120
I'll wash them after. Okay?

30:33.150 --> 30:34.910
- All of them?
- Yeah.

30:34.950 --> 30:38.190
And the vegetables
you can put in the fridge, please.

30:38.220 --> 30:40.600
And... Dana is outside,
so if you need anything, it's okay.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.400
Okay.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.710
I'll be back in like, an hour,
an hour and a half.

30:44.740 --> 30:47.860
- Okay. See you later.
- Bye. Thank you.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.110
What is he doing?

32:35.150 --> 32:37.240
Did you turn on the oven?

32:38.030 --> 32:40.150
Anat, he can't use the oven,
it's forbidden.

32:40.190 --> 32:42.440
I know, we won't sell those.
What are you doing?

32:43.320 --> 32:45.490
It's a surprise
for Itai's birthday.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.540
No, you cannot
turn on the oven, okay?

32:48.570 --> 32:51.710
You're not Jewish, so this is not
Kosher. You understand?

32:51.740 --> 32:54.860
We cannot use it, we have
to throw it in the garbage now.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.940
If Avram sees this,
your cafe is finished, Anat.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.110
I know.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.110
Come, I want to talk
to you outside.

33:26.110 --> 33:30.280
- Thomas, what are you doing?
- He told me to throw it away.

33:30.320 --> 33:34.360
Don't, just leave it, okay?
Listen, it's very nice what you did,

33:34.570 --> 33:36.790
but you can't touch the oven,
you can't bake here, okay?

33:36.820 --> 33:39.900
Don't do anything
that I'm not asking you to do.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.040
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry, it's okay.

33:43.070 --> 33:45.150
I'll take care of it.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.280
Go home, okay, just...

33:48.320 --> 33:50.240
Go home.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.070
Hello?

34:33.110 --> 34:36.070
Hello? Thomas?

34:36.110 --> 34:37.190
Hello?

34:37.570 --> 34:39.610
Thomas, it's Anat.

34:39.739 --> 34:42.820
I just wanted to say thanks
for the cookies you made,

34:42.860 --> 34:44.860
and they're very good.

34:44.989 --> 34:47.940
- You like them?
- Yes.

34:47.989 --> 34:50.120
I would like to sell them
at the cafe.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.210
If we pay attention
to some rules,

34:52.239 --> 34:54.400
it will be fine
with the "Kosher".

34:54.440 --> 34:56.460
So I'll see you tomorrow.

34:56.489 --> 34:58.440
Okay, bye.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.210
- Can I try?
- They're still warm.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.320
- They'll fall apart.
- That's ok.

35:35.940 --> 35:37.150
Hello!

35:38.030 --> 35:39.190
Yes?

35:40.150 --> 35:42.240
Is he alright?

35:42.320 --> 35:45.440
What do you mean?
Where is he?

35:45.490 --> 35:48.570
What do you mean,
you don't know where my son is?

36:04.030 --> 36:06.110
Excuse me,
can I have a cappuccino?

36:07.240 --> 36:10.280
- What?
- A cappuccino, please.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.440
A cappuccino?
Okay.

37:19.150 --> 37:20.210
Hello?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.320
- Hello, Thomas?
- Yeah?

37:23.190 --> 37:24.320
Listen, it's Motti.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.440
- Is Anat's son there?
- No.

37:27.530 --> 37:29.040
No. Okay...

37:29.190 --> 37:31.740
Listen, he ran away from school
and we're looking for him,

37:31.830 --> 37:34.820
so if he comes to the cafe,
just call Anat, okay?

37:34.860 --> 37:36.860
Okay.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.820
- You have Anat's cell phone number?
- Yes.

37:39.860 --> 37:41.940
- So you call her immediately, okay?
- Okay.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.030
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:35.900 --> 40:39.030
This is the best apartment
I could find you.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.150
Thank you.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.400
Here you have the kitchen.

40:49.490 --> 40:52.570
This is milk, this is meat, okay?

40:52.860 --> 40:56.940
This is milk dishes,
and there you have meat dishes.

40:58.070 --> 41:01.320
You wash the milk here
and the meat here. That's it.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.360
Okay?

41:04.400 --> 41:07.440
You're not Jewish,
but this is a Kosher apartment.

41:07.490 --> 41:10.650
and it has to stay Kosher.
The owner trusts me.

41:11.650 --> 41:13.740
Thank you.

41:14.650 --> 41:16.790
Can I use the oven?

41:16.820 --> 41:19.900
Yeah, you can use
whatever you want.

41:22.990 --> 41:25.110
You have a nice view here.

42:26.490 --> 42:29.610
Some lady just bought
a full box of your cookies.

42:29.650 --> 42:31.820
- That's nice.
- What's in there?

42:32.900 --> 42:37.030
It's just a basic recipe,
it's flour, sugar, butter...

42:37.070 --> 42:41.190
Yeah, okay, but how much flour?
How much butter?

42:42.150 --> 42:47.410
For one tray it's 250 grams flour,
125 grams butter,

42:47.440 --> 42:52.570
75 grams sugar,
and one teaspoon of vanilla.

42:52.650 --> 42:54.710
Good morning, Anat.

42:54.740 --> 42:57.780
- How are you doing, Avram?
- Thank God.

42:58.150 --> 43:00.240
- Is that the German?
- Yes.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.290
How are you doing?
Nice to meet you.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.360
Nice to meet you.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.460
- You made this?
- Yes, sir, but I didn't use the oven.

43:08.490 --> 43:10.490
Nice.

43:10.530 --> 43:13.780
- Since when do you sell cookies?
- We've only just started.

43:14.820 --> 43:16.830
How is Itai?

43:16.860 --> 43:18.860
Thank God.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.030
Very nice, Anat.

43:25.150 --> 43:27.320
- See you, folks.
- See you.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.320
Bye.

43:37.690 --> 43:41.740
Do you want to come and have
dinner with us on Friday night?

43:45.900 --> 43:49.070
You probably have plans, but...

43:50.030 --> 43:53.240
No, nothing planned.
I can come.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.570
Just us, you know,
just you and me and Itai.

44:00.650 --> 44:04.610
Can I bring something?
I'm not going to use the oven.

44:04.650 --> 44:07.940
No, it's okay,
we don't eat Kosher at home,

44:08.990 --> 44:12.040
so you can...
yeah, you can bring anything.

44:12.070 --> 44:13.990
Okay.

44:15.070 --> 44:16.240
Good.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.360
Let's go.

44:25.610 --> 44:30.860
Shabbat candle-lighting time
is at 16:27.

44:31.690 --> 44:32.900
16:27. Good Shabbos.

44:35.030 --> 44:37.110
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.240
- Hello.
- Hi.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.440
I'm sorry, it's all wet.

45:11.490 --> 45:13.610
- Come in.
- But my shoes are all...

45:14.490 --> 45:17.610
Okay, no, but come in,
because it's cold.

45:20.820 --> 45:22.900
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

45:23.820 --> 45:25.030
And...

45:25.860 --> 45:29.030
- This is for later.
- Great. Thanks.

45:30.030 --> 45:33.190
You want to maybe... I don't know,
you want to dry yourself?

45:33.240 --> 45:35.360
Yeah? Okay.
It's the bathroom over there.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
- Okay.
- I'll give you...

45:37.440 --> 45:39.570
- Left?
- I'll find you some clothes.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.360
Hurry up, dinner is ready.

46:17.110 --> 46:19.240
- You can sit down.
- Thank you.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.990
Do you want
to say the blessing?

46:40.030 --> 46:41.990
Yes.

46:42.030 --> 46:44.110
We don't have to.

46:45.190 --> 46:47.240
- Yes.
- Okay.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.320
Sit nicely.

46:55.610 --> 46:57.750
- Together?
- Yes.

46:58.780 --> 47:05.990
The sixth day. And the heavens and the
earth and all their hosts were completed.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.030
And God finished
by the Seventh Day His work,

47:10.070 --> 47:13.150
and He rested on the Seventh Day
from all His work.

47:13.190 --> 47:16.490
And God blessed the Seventh Day
and made it holy,

47:17.320 --> 47:19.440
for on it
He rested from all His work.

47:19.490 --> 47:21.490
Blessed are you,
Lord, our God,

47:21.530 --> 47:24.650
Sovereign of the universe,
who creates the fruit of the vine. Amen.

47:24.690 --> 47:26.690
Say Amen.

47:27.780 --> 47:28.900
Amen.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.320
- Where does he live?
- Where does he live?

47:40.280 --> 47:43.360
Now he lives here,
but he came from Germany.

47:46.650 --> 47:48.690
Where is his mother?

47:49.780 --> 47:51.780
I don't know.

47:51.820 --> 47:54.900
- He wants to ask you a question.
- Okay.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.150
He wants to know
where your mother is.

48:01.070 --> 48:03.190
I don't have a mother.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.360
I grew up
with my grandmother.

48:06.400 --> 48:09.650
He doesn't have a mother,
he grew up with his grandmother.

48:11.610 --> 48:12.780
Where is his father?

48:13.570 --> 48:15.750
Enough,
you're asking too many questions.

48:15.780 --> 48:18.900
If he doesn't want to answer,
he doesn't have to.

48:18.990 --> 48:21.990
He wants to know where
your father is.

48:23.070 --> 48:26.070
My father left
when I was very young.

48:33.490 --> 48:35.530
He doesn't want to answer.

48:36.530 --> 48:38.570
- Okay.
- Okay?

48:44.820 --> 48:48.990
So... this is...

48:49.070 --> 48:51.240
Schwarzwälderkirschtorte.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.240
Classical German recipe.

48:59.530 --> 49:02.570
- No, you made this cake?
- Yes.

49:02.690 --> 49:05.650
Itai, Thomas made it himself!

49:05.740 --> 49:07.820
Look at this cake.

49:14.070 --> 49:16.110
Would you like some?

49:16.530 --> 49:17.650
No.

49:17.690 --> 49:19.610
How come?

49:19.650 --> 49:22.690
Motti told me not to eat
what Thomas bakes.

49:23.780 --> 49:25.990
- Really?
- Yes.

49:26.900 --> 49:29.070
- Is that what he said?
- Yes.

49:33.280 --> 49:37.240
You don't have to listen
to everything your uncle says.

49:58.150 --> 50:00.360
You should try it,
it's very good.

50:04.440 --> 50:06.650
Want to eat the cream at least?

50:07.440 --> 50:09.780
The white part isn't forbidden.

50:10.610 --> 50:11.860
Okay.

52:46.860 --> 52:47.960
Okay?

52:47.990 --> 52:49.940
Thank you.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.280
What's up?

52:57.320 --> 52:59.440
- Do you have a minute?
- Shoot.

52:59.490 --> 53:01.530
Why don't you answer my calls?

53:01.570 --> 53:03.650
Sorry,
but you see how it is here.

53:03.690 --> 53:05.740
I thought
you'd come for Shabbat.

53:05.780 --> 53:08.780
Did you tell Itai
not to eat Thomas' food?

53:08.820 --> 53:11.940
Yes, I don't want him
to eat non- Kosher food.

53:11.990 --> 53:15.190
And I don't want him to be afraid
of eating, Kosher or not.

53:17.150 --> 53:20.400
Forget Itai, think about the cafe.
You employ a non- Jewish worker,

53:21.190 --> 53:23.320
people talk,
you'll lose your Kosher certificate.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.530
Thanks to him,
I have an order for 60 people.

53:26.400 --> 53:29.540
People come here to eat his cakes,
not mine. I don't bake.

53:29.570 --> 53:32.860
- Enough with this Kosher issue.
- Lower you voice, people can hear.

53:32.900 --> 53:36.960
So let them hear. I'm not religious
and I don't want to be religious.

53:36.990 --> 53:39.070
Get off my back.

54:45.650 --> 54:47.780
Kredenz Cafe & Bakery

55:47.150 --> 55:50.240
I made a shopping list.
You want to go?

55:51.190 --> 55:52.490
Yeah, I'll come.

55:59.690 --> 56:03.740
We will take two boxes
of the yellow apples.

56:03.900 --> 56:05.820
Two boxes?

56:05.860 --> 56:08.070
No, the green ones.
Please.

56:39.150 --> 56:42.440
Okay, I'm done here.
What should I do next?

56:44.320 --> 56:45.570
You can help me
with the dough.

56:46.400 --> 56:49.740
No, I think it's better if you give me,
like, easy missions,

56:49.780 --> 56:52.620
because I'm not very good
with dough.

56:52.650 --> 56:53.900
I'll show you.

56:54.780 --> 56:57.030
No, really, like,
I don't get along.

56:57.860 --> 57:00.000
I tried to make something
for Oren once,

57:00.030 --> 57:02.150
and the dough
would just not rise at all.

57:02.190 --> 57:05.360
Because yeast and I just don't...
don't get along.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.440
You just need to know
how to treat the yeast.

57:13.530 --> 57:14.780
Okay, I'll try.

57:15.610 --> 57:16.860
Okay, so...

57:17.650 --> 57:19.900
take a little bit of flour
in your hands,

57:20.940 --> 57:22.030
like this,

57:22.860 --> 57:25.030
and then take one...

57:26.240 --> 57:29.150
me another,
and then you... yeah.

57:29.190 --> 57:31.400
Roll it, fast.

57:34.440 --> 57:36.440
And then...

57:39.780 --> 57:40.940
- You make it...
- See?

57:40.990 --> 57:44.900
A little flour,
you make it flat, like this.

57:45.150 --> 57:47.070
Then turn...

57:49.320 --> 57:51.240
And put it here.

58:03.650 --> 58:05.820
Your husband, he died, right?

58:07.990 --> 58:09.900
Yeah.

58:10.110 --> 58:12.190
In a car accident.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.460
Actually, he used to go
to Berlin a lot

58:20.490 --> 58:24.490
because he had
a very big work project there.

58:26.610 --> 58:30.710
He used to bring us cookies
from there,

58:30.740 --> 58:32.990
very good cookies, like...

58:33.900 --> 58:36.990
similar like the ones you make.

58:37.070 --> 58:40.240
The cinnamon ones,
but a little better.

58:57.360 --> 59:00.490
What about you?
Do you have someone in Germany?

59:01.570 --> 59:03.570
No.

59:19.190 --> 59:22.240
I wasn't sure,
but I saw some light.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.530
I don't want to
disturb, I just came to say hello.

59:27.610 --> 59:29.710
You're not
disturbing, Hanna.

59:29.740 --> 59:32.700
Anat, dear...

59:32.860 --> 59:36.920
We just got stuck late here today,
we're about to finish.

59:36.950 --> 59:38.950
Want a ride home?

59:38.990 --> 59:41.070
No, I'll take the bus.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.240
Come on,
I'll drive you home.

59:45.530 --> 59:47.620
Do you want a ride?
I'll take you home.

59:47.650 --> 59:50.700
Oh, thanks,
that will be great. Thank you.

59:54.070 --> 59:56.110
- Hello.
- Hello.

59:58.030 --> 59:59.280
Are you Thomas?

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.320
Yes.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.400
Do you speak Hebrew?

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.490
English.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.740
I know a little bit German.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.110
But my son, he spoke
very very well German. He...

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.200
He spoke five languages
very well.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.320
You knew my son?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.400
I'm sorry,
I didn't know your son.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:40.820
Shall we?

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:43.820
Thank you, Anat.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.240
- Bye.
- Good night.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.030
- Good night.
- Bye.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.240
- Will you help me with my...?
- Oh, yes, of course.

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.490
Here, come.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.740
Here, put it here, thanks...

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:32.650
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.070
Okay.

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.200
Wait.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Wait, because I want
to give you something,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.320
something I cooked for Shabbat,

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.450
and this is very good,

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:55.780
it's eggplants
with cheese and with basil.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.780
- It's for you.
- It's...

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.780
- I can't take, it's too much.
- No, no, take it, please.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.150
You will enjoy this, this is...
Nobody here will eat it.

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:11.240
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.280
- I shouldn't let Anat wait.
- No, don't let her wait.

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:18.530
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:10.570
Sie haben 13 neue...

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.530
- Hi.
- Hi, Thomas.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.610
- How are you?
- Good.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.290
I was just about
to put this away,

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.450
and I thought maybe...

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:16.610
Maybe you can look if there are things
that you're interested in.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.820
- Okay.
- So, I don't know, just look.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.860
And if you don't want,

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.870
what you don't want,
you can put, maybe, on the street

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.150
and I'm sure someone...
someone will take.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.070
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:31.240
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.610
Nice!

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.200
This is new.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.200
Maybe you try it? It's...

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.450
- What is it?
- It's bread. I made it.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.490
Maybe you'll like it.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.530
Thank you.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:07.860
See you tomorrow morning.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.359
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:45.569
Shabbat Shalom!

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.819
Very nice you did here.

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:56.029
Feels like home.

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.240
My mother...

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:07.319
cooked you some food
for Shabbat.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.569
- You know it's Shabbat today?
- Yes.

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:14.649
So on Shabbat
it's not very good to stay alone.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.819
So next Shabbat, please,
you come to us, okay?

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.319
Okay, thank you.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.490
Okay.

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:25.649
Here you have potato latkes

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:29.819
and this is stuffed vegetables.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.950
Thank you.

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:40.200
So, Shabbat Shalom and good evening,
and next Shabbat you come to us.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.279
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.359
- Shabbat Shalom.
- Shabbat Shalom, bye.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:42.740
Cafe Paamon.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:50.860
Special occasions?
Yes, we do special occasions.

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:58.320
For how many people?

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.490
30? Okay.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.650
Okay, 30 cakes.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.780
So, which...?

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:11.900
Do you know what we have?

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.990
Five from every sort.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:21.110
Just let me check
if it's possible for Friday.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.200
I'll get back to you
in five minutes.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.400
I'll write down your number.

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:28.570
Yes.

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:31.740
Yes.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.820
Okay,
I'll get back to you soon.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.990
Yes, we're Kosher,
of course we're Kosher.

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.110
Thanks, goodbye.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.460
We just got an order
for Friday,

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:54.530
for, like,
many, many, many cakes.

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.610
- I don't know if we can do it.
- Okay.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:59.650
- I didn't tell her anything yet.
- What is it?

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.860
5 Black Forest,
5 with the apricots,

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.990
5 apple pies,
5 Streusel...

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:12.320
- That's it?
- No, one more.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.490
5... the chocolate rolls.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.650
What do you think?
It's too much, no?

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.740
It's a lot.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.900
It's... it's possible.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:29.650
- But I need your help.
- Yeah, okay.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.860
- Yeah?
- Sure.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.900
- Now.
- Now, we start.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:37.990
- Okay?
- Let's do it, yeah.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.200
Hi, Motti, how are you?

01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:17.490
- How are you, buddy?
- Okay.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.650
- We're late for a movie.
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.860
I'm really sorry, Motti.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.030
It's one thing that you only call
when you need help,

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.070
but your son wants you
to take him to the cinema,

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.400
and instead, you're here.

01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:38.570
I made you some soup.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.070
Let's go.

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.740
Anat, can you turn off
the fire, please?

01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.240
Sorry, I... sorry.

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.170
So what can I do?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.320
- Maybe just take a break.
- I don't want to take a break, okay?

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.450
I want to help.
So what can I do?

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.740
We need to flatten the dough.
Like, really flat.

01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:54.650
Okay.

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:16.530
It doesn't work.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.900
Look.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:32.240
What did I tell you?

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.490
You have to treat it,
you know, nicely.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.240
With your hands,
you have to make it warm.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.450
Make it, you know...
flour and then you have to...

01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:47.650
It's too cold.

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:53.820
And make it flat.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.900
Continue, okay?

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.070
You just...

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.360
Make it...

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.070
And God blessed the Seventh Day
and made it holy,

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.200
for on it He rested from all His work
which God created to function.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.360
Blessed are you,
Lord, our God

01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:21.320
Sovereign of the universe,
who creates the fruit of the vine.

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:37.110
What is his name?

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.150
Itai.

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.450
That's my wife.

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:54.860
Would you want
to have children?

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.820
No.

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:01.900
I can't do what you do.

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.110
Family is important.

01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:07.240
Not to be alone.

01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:15.650
I'm not alone.

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:32.150
I have my work,

01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:35.240
I have my apartment,

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.360
and I have you,

01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:41.530
once a month.

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.780
Some people have nothing.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.820
They are born alone

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:53.070
and die alone.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.200
My grandma always said: One should
appreciate what one has.

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:01.650
That's very important.

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.990
I grew up with her,

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.920
in her bakery in Gerswalde,

01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:13.200
it's a small village
outside Berlin,

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.400
just the two of us.

01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:25.780
She died two years ago.

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:51.610
When are you coming back?

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.820
In a month and a half.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.070
My wife
is opening her new cafe.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.320
What will happen
when she finds out?

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.530
It will never happen.

01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:30.710
When was the last time?

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.820
Yesterday.

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.950
Where?

01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:40.110
At home.

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:45.240
What did you do?

01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:53.610
I kissed her...
here.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.990
Where else?

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:08.240
On the ears,

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.490
on the neck...

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.740
And then what did you do?

01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:29.950
Love...

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.280
We made love.

01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:07.610
For you.

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:11.740
And this is for me,
and we start. Yes?

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.570
We put it inside...

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.950
we don't fill it too much
so it has place to grow.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.320
Yes, good.

01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:56.150
You want to see his room?

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:02.360
It's on the corridor,
the last door, it's...

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.610
it's open.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.830
I put only lemon,

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.030
but most people do put water.

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:11.280
I put just lemon,
that's Oren's way.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.370
He cooked for you?

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.610
No, just this,
that was his thing.

01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:23.650
No, he liked eating
better than cooking.

01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:27.780
Okay, we need some more.

01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:50.610
Can you tell me what this is?

01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:55.900
That's a receipt
from a Chinese restaurant.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.900
Yeah, I know, but I mean, what's...
what's in there?

01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:04.070
Here it says, 2...
2 tofu noodles,

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.360
1 mango juice,
1 apple juice.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.370
- That's a starter here...
- Okay.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.570
And this one?

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:16.740
That's a receipt
from a supermarket.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.740
What's... what's in there?

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.990
It has butter,

01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:27.740
milk, cream, flour.

01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:33.820
Okay, and...
this one?

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.960
I don't know,
there are many of these.

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:39.240
One in February,

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:41.320
two in March,

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.240
one in January.

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.570
He used to go there a lot,
I guess. I think it's Cafe Kredenz.

01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:52.570
Do you know it?

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.740
No.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.570
He wanted to move there,
to Berlin.

01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:19.650
He had someone there.

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.900
He told me.

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:30.240
And he wanted
to leave me and Itai here

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:33.200
and go to Berlin
and make a new life.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.570
And I didn't want him to stay here,
so I asked him to go

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.570
and he went to get a room
in a hotel, and...

01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:58.030
and then another car hit him

01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:01.360
on his way there.

01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:27.320
Public Warning -
Cafe Paamon is not Kosher.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.400
The public should take caution
and beware

01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:44.990
Dana!

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.320
What do we do with all of this?

01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:12.990
Motti, they took my certificate.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.410
I have an order for 120 people,
do you know how much it cost?

01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:26.610
They canceled, because it's...

01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:29.700
Fine.

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:41.660
You have 13 new messages.

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.740
First message.

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.860
Oren,
you're probably on the plane,

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:52.030
you forgot your cookies
and your keys here.

01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:55.200
I'll see you soon.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.320

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.490
To save, press 3.

01:36:04.570 --> 01:36:06.780
Oren, it's me,
I've called you five times,

01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:10.910
please call me back, okay?
Bye.

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:14.990
To delete this message,
press 2.

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:19.200
Oren, it's Thomas,
I don't know what's wrong.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.320
Just call...

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.530
Oren, it's Thomas.
Why aren't you calling me back?

01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:30.610
Oren, I'm calling for the...

01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:34.700
It's me, Thomas.

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.910
I love you.

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.950
Motti.

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.610
Here you have flight tickets.

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.780
This is 400 shekels.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.950
In four hours you have a flight

01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:56.160
so you have exactly one hour
to pack yourself.

01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:00.280
You take the money,
you go to the airport,

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.320
and you never come back
to this country.

01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:06.570
Do you understand me?

01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:11.740
I can't go.

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.860
Do you understand me?

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.290
- I have to talk to her.
- No, no talking! No talking!

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.280
She doesn't want
to talk to you, okay?

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.570
She doesn't want you here,
we don't want you here.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.610
Do you understand me?

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.740
Do you understand me?

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.320
Okay. One hour.

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.820
Shabbat!

01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:23.910
Shabbat!

01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:28.030
THREE MONTHS LATER

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:33.200
Let's go. Did you take
everything you need?

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.360
Yes.

01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:40.740
Let's go, we have to hurry.

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:49.990
- Are you coming?
- I'm coming. Hold on.

01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:29.530
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.540
Is the place Kosher?

01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:33.780
We don't have a certificate,
but the kitchen is Kosher.

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:35.780
It's up to you.

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.990
- Is this one any good?
- The best in Jerusalem.

01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:42.110
Was it made by the German guy
who works here?

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.160
It's his recipe,

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.200
but he doesn't
work here anymore.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.450
- Okay, I'll take one.
- Yes?

01:45:37.450 --> 01:45:41.700
THE CAKEMAKER
