"Vegas, Maybe?"
Closed Captioned

00:01.877 --> 00:03.253
Previously on 90210:

00:03.378 --> 00:05.088
You're working for a
congressional candidate?

00:05.213 --> 00:06.632
My uncle's running.
Uh, we could never be together

00:06.757 --> 00:08.300
if you're going
to work for him.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.343
I don't have any proof
of the stolen cars,

00:09.468 --> 00:11.010
but he threatened my girlfriend.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.388
Work with the police to get
the evidence we need.
I'm in.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.056
This is about business.
Just let me back in.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.936
I cannot trust anyone unless I
know where their loyalties lie.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.061
$10,000?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.647
They loved your picture so much

00:21.772 --> 00:24.399
I think you could
work a whole lot more.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.527
They paid us to
hang out with them?

00:26.652 --> 00:27.235
Bree, we are like prostitutes.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.237
No, we're not prostitutes.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.531
We're escorts.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.241
Bree sent me here to
meet with just you?

00:33.367 --> 00:37.663
I know we met in a way that
makes you uncomfortable,
but I really like you.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.248
I heard you say that you
don't want your heart broken.
You can pretty much count on it.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.083
You're just a girl
Austin's sleeping with.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.085
You'll never be his girlfriend,

00:44.211 --> 00:45.420
because Austin doesn't
have girlfriends.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.884
So you're not an addict?
No, Ade.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.218
DIXON:
Hey, I'll buy the
rest of your stash.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.897
Mm, I love the smell of
cinnamon in the morning.

01:03.022 --> 01:03.772
Hey, do not touch.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.983
I am making breakfast in
bed for the birthday boy.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.943
Don't you mean that
guy's making breakfast?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.570
Ludwig is providing
the breakfast,

01:09.695 --> 01:11.739
I am taking care of
the "in bed" part.

01:11.864 --> 01:12.907
Well, delicious.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.115
You're a really
good girlfriend.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.617
NAOMI:
I know, right?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.160
That sorority slut Holly says

01:17.285 --> 01:18.787
that Austin doesn't do
real relationships.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.039
She couldn't be more wrong.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.582
Hmm. Absolutely.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.417
Just because you guys
started off having

01:23.542 --> 01:25.753
hate sex motivated by revenge
doesn't mean you're not legit.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.671
Okay. Austin and I
have been dating

01:27.796 --> 01:29.464
just as long as you
and Mystery Moneybags,

01:29.590 --> 01:30.799
and you two are
pretty serious.

01:30.925 --> 01:31.842
Good point.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.135
Who am I to judge how
relationships get started?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.804
Hey!

01:35.930 --> 01:37.014
Where are you going?

01:37.138 --> 01:38.599
Pants off, back in bed!

01:38.724 --> 01:40.225
I can't. I gotta catch
a flight to Vegas.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.519
You're going to Vegas?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.021
I love Vegas.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.940
Well, that makes one of us.
I hate Vegas.

01:46.065 --> 01:46.982
You made waffles!

01:47.106 --> 01:49.735
Yeah.
That's sweet.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.820
Listen, you know I'd love to
spend my birthday with my gal,

01:51.946 --> 01:54.573
but my family's waiting.
Call you when I get back?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.784
(laughs)

01:59.036 --> 02:02.623
Did he really just take
a waffle to Vegas instead of me?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.177
Hi, Silver.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.013
"Teddy, I missed you!

02:18.138 --> 02:20.307
"Thanks for taking a break
from the campaign trail

02:20.432 --> 02:22.684
to come home and watch me work!"

02:22.810 --> 02:23.644
All right, man, look,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.437
the poll numbers are
stressing Marissa out,

02:25.562 --> 02:26.814
she's riding me like Seabiscuit

02:26.939 --> 02:29.316
to finish these videos
for the website.
I get it.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.943
(clears throat)
Thank you.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.989
Campaigning with my uncle makes
a tennis tour look easy.

02:35.114 --> 02:38.993
But on the bright side, my
family is talking to me again.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.035
They even invited me to
my sister's wedding.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.829
That's great.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.748
So who's the lucky date?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.750
What, like a man date?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.670
Oh. My dad would have a stroke.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.006
Besides, I just haven't
really met anyone I like.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.133
Since Shane?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.551
He's a good guy, Teddy,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.887
he's just passionate
about politics.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.139
And he was kind of
a jerk about it.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.850
But I miss him too.

03:02.975 --> 03:06.770
Well, if you need a beard
for your sister's wedding,

03:06.895 --> 03:08.647
my social calendar
is woefully empty.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.734
We're all going to Vegas!

03:12.860 --> 03:14.653
ANNIE:
Full disclosure:

03:14.778 --> 03:16.155
Naomi's actually
chasing Austin,

03:16.279 --> 03:18.157
who just left to spend his
birthday with his family.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.574
Oh, his family.
How dare he?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.870
Austin may have put
the thought into my head,

03:22.995 --> 03:25.413
but going by myself would be
sad and pathetic, so...

03:25.539 --> 03:27.499
I want to bring my sad and
pathetic friends with me.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.750
(Naomi laughs)

03:28.876 --> 03:31.586
What do you think? Yay!

03:31.712 --> 03:35.549
Uh... I guess "no"
is out of the question.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.800
I could use a break
from all this work.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.635
I'm in.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
Patrick's out of town,
I could use a trip.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.348
Looks like we're
going to Vegas.

03:43.473 --> 03:43.891
(laughs)
Yeah!

03:44.016 --> 03:45.308
(whoops)

03:46.518 --> 03:49.688
Oh! Bull's-eye!
Whoa!

03:49.813 --> 03:51.023
Dude. Totally
spanked you, bitch.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.067
No. No, no, no, no.
We paused the game for a sneeze.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.652
You can't throw during
a sneeze pause.
LIAM:
Hey, listen up.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.738
Naomi's organized
a last-minute trip to Vegas.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.406
Everyone's invited.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.742
Uh, almost.
Sorry, Silver's going.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.410
Yeah, yeah, I think
that'd be a little weird.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.995
I haven't talked to Silver
since we broke up.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.329
Yeah, and I don't think Vegas is
the best place for me right now.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.582
Why? Silver doesn't hate you.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.002
No, I... I mean, I...

04:12.127 --> 04:13.837
It's probably not the
best place for Navid.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.173
You know, he's going through
a real bad breakup, and...

04:16.297 --> 04:18.425
Vegas is full of temptation.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.386
So the easiest way to resist is
to have a good friend nearby,

04:21.511 --> 04:23.764
so, good friend, I will be
on you like white on rice.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.348
Oh, yeah, of course.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.434
Because I might have to
drown my sorrows over Silver

04:27.559 --> 04:27.851
in cheap prime rib.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.436
(laughs)

04:29.561 --> 04:31.063
Is that why you've
been so clingy?

04:31.188 --> 04:32.564
Yeah. I mean, why
else would I be?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.233
Well, listen, cling
to Navid in Vegas.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.484
I already promised
Naomi we were in. All right?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.694
This should be cool. Come on.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.571
I've never been to Vegas
with money before.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.697
Yeah. Vegas does sound
great right now.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.741
I'm in.
Yes.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.785
We are not sharing a room.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.661
Hey, I'll meet you
guys at the airport.
Yep.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.542
Uh... hey.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.878
Uh, it would be great
to see you there.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.463
(laughs)

04:56.588 --> 04:58.465
Right. Because it's
not a road trip

04:58.590 --> 05:00.550
without Silver and I pulling
hair and falling into a pool.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.180
Are you okay?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.640
I mean, with everything?

05:06.765 --> 05:10.102
Me? Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.270
I thought we settled
all that with your...

05:11.394 --> 05:14.064
24-hour handcuff marathon.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.690
I told you I'm drug-free.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.609
I mean, it's not like the minute
I get to Vegas without you,

05:17.734 --> 05:19.319
I'm gonna turn into
a drug fiend, right?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.988
(chuckles)

05:21.113 --> 05:22.739
You're cute when you worry
about me, you know that?

05:26.743 --> 05:28.870
Okay. I drop off
these three DVDs,

05:28.996 --> 05:31.081
and then we are off to Vegas.
All right.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.958
Oh, Silver! Good.
Hi.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.752
I need your feedback on some raw
footage from our last rally.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.588
And then... you can look
over these still shots.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.090
Actually, Marissa, uh...

05:40.215 --> 05:42.759
don't kill me, but I sort of
thought I had the weekend off,

05:42.884 --> 05:44.343
and my friends are
going to Vegas.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.471
Vegas? Well, what am I
going to do without you?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.973
You know what?

05:48.098 --> 05:50.934
You've been working really hard.
You've earned some time off.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.727
Oh! Thank you.
Yeah.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.813
Thank you. I'll see
you on Monday.
Okay.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.398
But... can you keep your cell
phone handy, and your laptop?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.818
I'm sure you won't need it,
but if there's an emergency...

05:59.943 --> 06:01.320
Absolutely. It'll be
like I never left.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.446
Okay.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.784
Hey.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.203
(clears throat)

06:09.328 --> 06:10.204
Hey.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.747
So how's the campaign going?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.541
Good.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.754
So should we talk about
religion, too, or

06:19.880 --> 06:21.464
stick to fighting
about politics?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.051
How about neither?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.178
Good.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.637
'Cause I owe you
an apology, Teddy.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.598
I get caught up in
the issues sometimes,

06:30.724 --> 06:31.933
and I forget about
what's important.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.476
People.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.520
Although I admit, it's...

06:35.645 --> 06:37.356
it's been hard to
forget about you.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.316
Yeah. Me, too.

06:41.151 --> 06:45.572
So... maybe when I get back
from Vegas, we can hang out?

06:45.697 --> 06:49.159
Yeah, that'd be great.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.995
(clears throat)
Okay.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.164
I think this is where,
Shane, you say,

06:54.289 --> 06:55.165
"Vegas? That sounds like fun."

06:55.290 --> 06:56.499
And then Teddy, you say,

06:56.624 --> 06:58.919
"Really? You want
to come with us?"

06:59.044 --> 07:00.379
What she said.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.715
Cool. Yeah.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.592
Cool.
Seriously.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.303
How two guys ever figure out
how to date is just beyond me.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.807
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.601
Where do you think you're
going, Half-day Hassan?

07:17.478 --> 07:19.439
After you drop off
my dry-cleaning,

07:19.564 --> 07:22.109
I need you to go
to the market,

07:22.234 --> 07:23.902
and get me that cereal

07:24.027 --> 07:25.946
with the little
blueberries in it.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.282
Yeah. When I said I want
to be more involved in

07:28.407 --> 07:30.117
the family business, running
your errands isn't what I meant.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.868
I'm going to Vegas.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.494
And don't forget to walk your
dog when I'm out of town.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.414
I, I, I get it.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.750
You're frustrated. You want to
do something more important.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.460
It happens...

07:42.087 --> 07:45.299
...that I have a package.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.260
that needs to be delivered
to an associate in Vegas.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.510
What is it?

07:49.636 --> 07:52.180
It's a very interesting
thing called

07:52.306 --> 07:54.349
none of your business.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.852
Now...

07:57.978 --> 08:00.897
You will be contacted
about the delivery details.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.567
Until then, guard
this with your life,

08:04.692 --> 08:06.236
and do not open it.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.238
If you want to gain my trust...

08:09.697 --> 08:10.573
...don't screw this up.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.700
Yeah.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.965
Kat, it's me.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.758
I think I finally got something

08:28.883 --> 08:30.635
that'll take down my uncle.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.786
Presidential suite.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.247
Oh, Naomi, this
place is great.
This is great.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.501
NAOMI:
Don't thank me, thank the guy
with the million-dollar abs.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.503
DIXON:
Wait, wait. You paid for this?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.838
Dude, thanks for
the suite, Moneybags.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.673
You know, you guys have
been paying for me

09:08.798 --> 09:10.800
for a long time. It's nice
to finally return the favor.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.011
(laughing)
Oh, I got dibs on this one.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.554
I'll get the bags.
Uh, yeah, me too.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.972
This place is
dripping with bling.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.725
Yeah, it's really...

09:21.102 --> 09:22.437
So...
How have you been?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.772
You know, uh...

09:24.898 --> 09:25.773
You?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.068
Same.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.738
Okay. I'm gonna...
Yeah.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.115
Uh...

09:34.241 --> 09:35.616
Hey, um...

09:35.742 --> 09:36.493
Are you going to be okay

09:36.617 --> 09:39.287
with, you know,
your little problem?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.081
Problem? Um...

09:41.206 --> 09:42.707
What... what problem?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.043
Well, come on, we're in the
gambling capital of the world,

09:45.168 --> 09:46.836
and I know you have
a gambling problem, so...

09:46.961 --> 09:49.005
I'm just a little bit
worried, you know?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.091
Yeah, um... uh...

09:51.216 --> 09:53.301
That's not a problem.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.929
At all. I won't even
gamble a nickel.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.972
As long as I'm with my
friends, I'll be fine.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.558
All right. Good.
Seriously.

10:03.644 --> 10:04.938
NAOMI:
Unbelievable!

10:05.063 --> 10:07.899
I called the three best
hotels on the Strip,

10:08.024 --> 10:09.609
and Austin isn't registered
at a single one.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.320
Hmm. Are you sure
he said Vegas?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.738
Of course. It's not like he's
going to lie to his girlfriend.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.655
(sighs)

10:14.781 --> 10:16.575
You know what? He's
probably at one of those

10:16.699 --> 10:17.784
Western-themed hotels downtown.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.119
You know, where you rope
your own cow for dinner?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.287
Mm-hmm.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.580
Do we have a butler?

10:23.915 --> 10:26.084
SILVER:
Are you really texting a picture
of yourself to Austin?

10:26.209 --> 10:28.128
Um, would you look
at me in this bikini?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.422
It'd be selfish not to share.
Well, if you can't
track him down,

10:30.547 --> 10:31.923
that ought to bring
him out of hiding.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.383
(giggles)

10:33.508 --> 10:35.093
Why are you
waiting in line?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.596
Uh, I was hoping to
get in one last swim

10:37.720 --> 10:39.639
before I die of heat stroke.
(giggles)

10:39.764 --> 10:40.932
Celebrities don't
have to wait in line.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.850
Who's the celebrity?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.644
WOMAN:
Uh, that'd be you.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.105
That's really nice of you,
but I can't leave my friends.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.440
They can come, too.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.858
We can...
Come on.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.319
Really?

10:52.444 --> 10:54.154
Yeah! Thank you.
All right!

10:56.406 --> 10:59.075
Help yourselves to
complimentary drinks,

10:59.200 --> 11:00.577
towels, and gift bags.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.163
And if there's anything else
you need, just ask me.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.457
All right, thanks.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.584
(exclaiming)

11:10.878 --> 11:12.506
Wow.
Oh, man.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.215
It's paradise.
Dude, I knew
being friends with you

11:14.341 --> 11:15.800
would one day pay off.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.177
(grunts)

11:17.302 --> 11:19.971
(chuckling):
Yeah!

11:20.096 --> 11:21.931
(cell phone rings)

11:22.056 --> 11:23.224
Hello.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.267
Silver.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.019
Hi. Did I catch you
at a bad time?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.562
Marissa, uh, it's never
a bad time

11:27.686 --> 11:29.022
to get a call from your boss.
What's up?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.774
Well, I'm putting together
a last-minute town hall meeting,

11:31.899 --> 11:32.984
and I need some footage recut.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.986
And I swear,

11:35.111 --> 11:36.363
this is the last thing
I'm gonna ask you to do,

11:36.488 --> 11:37.572
and then you're on vacation.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.366
Yeah, for sure.
I'll get right on it.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.367
Okay, thank you.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.371
You are not seriously
going to do work in Vegas?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.373
Apparently, I'm indispensable.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.667
Yeah? Well, I'm hot.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.168
In more ways than one.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.378
Mm.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.546
I'm gonna go sit
in the shade.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.799
Hello, boys.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.843
Hey!

11:59.927 --> 12:01.888
(man whistles)

12:02.013 --> 12:04.057
Wow. That body's impressive.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.975
Yeah, yeah.
She's pretty proud of it.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.436
I was talking about yours, bro.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.688
I'd kill for abs like that.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.106
What up?
Hey, man.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.567
Came to the right pool,
my dude.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.817
This place

12:14.942 --> 12:17.070
treats celebs like God.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.863
Anything you need,
they'll get it for you.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.283
Seriously, anything.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.082
Actually, all I want to do
is just cool off.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.958
Uh, are we going swimming
or what?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.211
Huh?
I'm in.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.213
Hey, Sally,

12:35.338 --> 12:37.424
you gonna put down
your murse, take a dip?
Huh?

12:37.549 --> 12:38.925
Your man-purse.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.010
You haven't set it down
since we left L.A.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.470
I don't want to lose it;
it's a family heirloom.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.930
Heirloom?
What, what, your grandma?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.640
(laughter)

12:45.764 --> 12:47.475
Grandma's murse!

12:47.601 --> 12:48.851
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

12:48.976 --> 12:50.604
You know what?
Let's go swimming.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.813
Annie, can you please
watch this bag?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.111
(all yelling)

13:00.280 --> 13:01.406
(chuckles)

13:01.531 --> 13:02.741
(sighs)

13:02.865 --> 13:04.451
I'm really glad
you came with us.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.453
I'm having a great time.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.413
Me, too.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.830
Would it be
terribly antisocial of us

13:09.956 --> 13:12.667
to ditch the group tonight
and go out, the two of us?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.877
I think I could live with that.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.338
Yeah?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.174
Thanks.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.722
No way!

13:25.846 --> 13:27.766
The Regional Asset
Allocation Convention?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.351
Um, you lost me at "regional."

13:30.477 --> 13:32.853
Patrick is at that convention.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.105
I'm totally gonna find him
looking fabulous

13:34.230 --> 13:35.356
and surprise him.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.734
Surprise the boyfriend in Vegas.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.111
That sounds like a plan.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.782
Austin!

13:45.366 --> 13:46.909
Hi. You found me.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.077
Well, I got
your 50 messages.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.079
It wasn't hard.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.499
What are you doing here?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.833
Um, the group wanted to go to
Vegas, so I thought, why not?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.294
I was going to surprise you
for your birthday

13:56.419 --> 13:57.420
to see the look on your face.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.049
And there is the look.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.760
That was fun.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.261
All right,
I'll see you back home.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.897
♪ ♪

14:27.867 --> 14:31.329
One.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.790
Yo, how about you come to
a poker game with me tonight?

14:33.914 --> 14:36.917
It's invitation-only,
and there's an extra seat.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.962
Oh, man, that sounds awesome,
but, um, I'm not 21.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.506
This is more of
a private game.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.883
You got to be a somebody
to even get into the door.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
Here. Check it out.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.305
Cool, I'll
think about it.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.306
Ladies...

14:54.352 --> 14:56.020
Okay, listen, I'm not in the
mood for practical jokes.

14:56.145 --> 14:56.979
Where's my bag?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.272
Dude, relax.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.524
Annie asked me
to watch it.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.318
I covered your murse
with a towel to be safe.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.405
It was here a second ago,

15:05.530 --> 15:07.448
I swear.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.241
This can't be happening.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.076
No, you don't understand.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.828
I need that bag.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.497
Oh, no.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.000
Some guy in a bikini must have
walked off with your purse.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.503
(laughter)

15:22.004 --> 15:24.507
NAVID: Seriously, guys.
This isn't funny.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.178
I'm a dead man.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.973
I get the feeling
you're not happy to see me.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.350
Of course I'm
happy to see you.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.143
I just, I just wish
you hadn't come.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.520
Austin, what is going on?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.105
Why don't you want me
here for your birthday?

15:39.230 --> 15:40.899
Because I don't want to
be here for my birthday.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.860
What?
Look, birthdays are a
big deal to my dad, okay?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.737
He likes to just keep
them family-only.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.239
Okay, no offense, but who cares
what your dad thinks?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.156
It's your birthday.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.534
Who does he think he is?

15:53.578 --> 15:54.621
That guy.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.125
My dad is that guy.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.587
Judd Ridge, the country legend?

16:02.712 --> 16:03.588
Yeah.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.881
That's your dad?

16:05.005 --> 16:05.924
Uh-huh.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.508
Austin, why didn't
you just tell me?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.385
It's not just you; I
don't tell anybody.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.053
What, 'cause it's too cool?

16:11.178 --> 16:13.347
Hey, no, being a fan
is too cool, okay?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.433
Listen, being his son
is something else.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.477
Because, you know, it's
his fame, not mine.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.145
I just stand in his
shadow when I'm with him.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.063
Okay, okay.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.982
Well, while I'm here,

16:23.107 --> 16:26.026
could we stand
in his shadow together?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.947
You could at least
go for a drink with me.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.825
Okay, yeah.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.200
I mean, after a night out
with my old man,

16:33.326 --> 16:34.953
I'm gonna need one anyway.

16:35.077 --> 16:35.745
Listen, he's having
this birthday party

16:35.870 --> 16:38.205
for me after his concert
that I can't get out of.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.124
So why don't you swing by

16:40.249 --> 16:42.502
and we'll, uh, sneak out,
have some fun.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.503
Okay?

16:43.628 --> 16:44.796
Okay.

16:44.921 --> 16:45.964
I'd love to.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.757
Okay.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.760
See ya.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
I'm sorry we couldn't
find your bro-purse.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.893
Yeah, take this
dry-cleaning ticket.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.728
It's for my
favorite suit.

17:00.854 --> 17:01.980
I'd like to be buried in it.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.481
Uh, whoa, hey.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.648
Um, no offense,
but these guys

17:04.773 --> 17:06.693
look a little
out of your league, Liam.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.194
Please. I spent all
summer on a fishing boat.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.321
If I can hold my own
playing poker against

17:11.446 --> 17:13.115
a bunch of tattooed
longshoremen,

17:13.240 --> 17:14.826
I think I can
handle this crowd.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.202
Yo, what up, kid?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.871
Hey.
Glad you made it.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.789
How you doing?
Good.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.000
Yo, I hope you brought
a fat stack with you, bro.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.919
Uh, you know,
it's not really that fat, but...

17:25.044 --> 17:26.671
Dude, you kill me.
Cash isn't good here.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.964
The house will give you credit.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.049
All right,
poker room is that way,

17:30.174 --> 17:31.258
lounge is that way.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.969
And between you and me,

17:33.093 --> 17:33.761
see this chick right here?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.555
That's the concierge.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.724
She'll hook you up
with whatever you need.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.517
I call her
"the drugstore."

17:43.229 --> 17:44.146
Hey, you okay?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.857
You're sweating.
Yeah.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.441
What's up?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.610
Oh, man,
I'm a terrible friend.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.237
I completely forgot about
your gambling problem.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.031
We should go.
Yeah, let's get
out of here.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.365
No, no, guys.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.076
Believe me, I have
that addiction under control.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.912
Plus, it'll be
positive reinforcement

17:59.037 --> 17:59.954
to see you lose all your money.
(chuckles)

18:00.079 --> 18:01.831
Hey, my murse.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.584
I have to go talk
to that guy.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.212
Yo, yo, yo.
Where are you going?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.339
I was gonna...
No, no.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.716
Seat at this table
is invitation only.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.801
If Liam wants to bring
his little entourage,

18:13.927 --> 18:14.886
you're gonna
have to ask him.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.262
Are you ready?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.722
Buy-in's ten large.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.433
Whoa, what--
that's $10,000, kid.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.893
Dude, I got this.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.603
What's the point
of me having all this money

18:23.728 --> 18:26.105
if I can't have
a little fun, huh?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.315
Come on, entourage.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.400
Are you sure?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.869
Hey, lady, can I get a cup
of coffee when you have a sec?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.662
Yeah, yeah.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.622
How was it
out there?

18:42.747 --> 18:44.248
Oh, it was freezing,
but I kind of like it

18:44.373 --> 18:45.959
when it's not that crowded.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.585
Is that why
you didn't go to Vegas?

18:47.710 --> 18:51.839
Uh, I just couldn't
really imagine partying

18:51.965 --> 18:53.257
while Raj is off getting
cancer treatment.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.467
You know what I mean?

18:54.592 --> 18:57.219
So instead, I booked
a ticket out tonight

18:57.344 --> 18:59.806
to spend the rest of the time
with him until he finishes.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.891
Aw, he's gonna be
so happy to see you.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.477
I was talking to him
this morning

19:04.602 --> 19:05.686
before he went into
his treatment,

19:05.812 --> 19:07.897
and I could just tell
how scared he was.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.357
'Cause he was doing this
thing where he was trying to

19:10.483 --> 19:12.902
joke around about being able
to handle the chemo on his own.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.737
And I just...

19:14.862 --> 19:15.613
(sighs):
I don't know...

19:15.738 --> 19:17.657
I knew from the moment
he said that,

19:17.782 --> 19:19.450
that I should have never
let him go without me.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.329
Yeah.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.915
I think I know what you mean.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.221
Hey, um, let's
get out of here.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.474
Huh? Why don't me, you
and your-your purse

19:43.599 --> 19:45.643
go see a show or
something, huh?

19:47.770 --> 19:48.855
I can't.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.106
Oh, I got to go.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.398
Okay, so where we going?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.275
No, we aren't
headed anywhere.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.444
Look, seeing Silver
was harder than I thought.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.738
I just, I need
some time alone, okay?

19:57.864 --> 19:58.990
Yeah, yeah.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.825
Um, no sweat.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.035
Hit me later.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.243
Cool.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.584
I raise you.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.630
I call.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.217
Full boat.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.593
(sighs)

20:19.719 --> 20:20.386
That sucks.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.181
'Cause I have a
straight flush.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.766
Yeah!

20:29.937 --> 20:32.523
Hey. You win some,
you lose some, right?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.483
What do you say we
go drown our sorrows

20:34.608 --> 20:36.276
at a buffet or
something, huh?

20:36.402 --> 20:40.280
I don't think I can afford it.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.783
I just lost $80,000.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.796
Naomi, you are going to blow
Austin's mind in that outfit.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.549
You are going to knock the wind
out of Patrick.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.550
Hi.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.885
(laughs)

21:01.010 --> 21:02.845
Silver, you look
really pretty.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.931
Don't look at
me like that.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.682
It just feels good
to be dressed up

21:06.807 --> 21:07.850
and not hunched
over a computer.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.185
Well, you deserve
to have fun.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.311
Thank you.
Any ideas?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.563
Okay, this is Vegas.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.481
Find a tall, dark,
handsome stranger,

21:14.607 --> 21:16.776
go back with him
to his hotel room,

21:16.901 --> 21:19.278
do the sickest things
you can possibly imagine.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.321
If you can wake up
in the morning, look at yourself

21:21.447 --> 21:23.032
in the mirror and not be
completely disgusted,

21:23.157 --> 21:24.617
I'll be totally disappointed.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.410
Okay, I was thinking
more along the lines

21:26.535 --> 21:28.495
of Cirque du Soleil
or Celine Dion,

21:28.621 --> 21:30.831
but I forgot I was
asking an insane person.
(cell phone rings)

21:32.833 --> 21:33.793
No, no, no!

21:33.918 --> 21:35.044
I was out the door.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.003
(clears throat)

21:36.129 --> 21:38.256
Hey, Marissa.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.381
Yeah.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.467
No problem. I can fax those
to you right away.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.384
Sure. Bye.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.805
Okay, well, looks like I'll be

21:45.930 --> 21:47.556
the prettiest girl
in the office center.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.394
Nope, not on the list.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.897
Austin doesn't have
a plus one.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.109
(chuckles) There must be
some mistake, okay?

21:58.234 --> 22:00.527
My boyfriend is in there
waiting for me.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.822
Look, I'm not saying
you're not his girlfriend,

22:02.947 --> 22:04.406
but are you sure
you're his girlfriend?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.576
(clown horn honks)

22:08.619 --> 22:10.496
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.623
A bunch of cheesy impersonators
are allowed into, yes,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.209
my boyfriend's birthday party,
and I'm stuck out here?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.129
They're part of the show.
Now step aside.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.760
Hey, Marilyn, um,

22:24.885 --> 22:26.637
would you like to make
some extra money?

22:31.767 --> 22:34.103
(cell phone rings)

22:34.228 --> 22:36.147
Hey.
Hey, babe.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.773
How you doing, sweetheart?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.234
I miss you. I keep thinking
about all the fun things

22:40.358 --> 22:42.486
that we could be doing
if we were in the same place.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.780
(chuckles)

22:44.905 --> 22:47.325
So, what if all of the distance
between us suddenly vanished?

22:47.449 --> 22:51.037
Mmm, well, that would be great.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.539
Uh... Oh, uh, listen, the person

22:53.664 --> 22:55.582
I'm having dinner
with just got here.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.375
I gotta go. I miss you.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.640
Do you have a lot of experience
putting on wires?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.726
Only because I watched
the show The Wire,

23:13.851 --> 23:16.145
and they...
they usually find the wire.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.771
I will be watching from the car.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.316
Anything happens,
I will be there in ten seconds.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.608
(phone buzzes)

23:21.734 --> 23:24.278
Better hurry up.
My contact is here.

23:24.402 --> 23:28.741
What do you think is in there?
I mean, drugs? Body part?
Can't we just open it?

23:28.866 --> 23:31.827
If they notice the package
has been tampered with,

23:31.952 --> 23:34.038
it could put you
and the drop in danger.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.540
I wouldn't have
come all the way from L.A.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.584
if I didn't think
this was important.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.878
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
I hope it's enough

23:41.003 --> 23:42.838
to put my uncle and his sleazy
friends in jail.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.423
Just get me out
of this mess.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.300
(doorknob rattles)

23:47.801 --> 23:48.677
(grunts)

23:48.802 --> 23:50.804
(sighs)

23:57.644 --> 24:00.022
Sorry. Housekeeping!

24:00.147 --> 24:00.647
(door closes)

24:06.153 --> 24:08.030
That was close.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.616
Oh, good thinking.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.840
Dude, I'm going crazy in here.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.052
This place is making me
completely claustrophobic.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.637
Seriously, let's just get
out of here.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.223
Yeah, well, it's a little
late for that.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.473
If this doesn't turn around,
I am broke.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.226
And I just don't mean
my savings.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.019
I mean, everything I own
in this world:

24:39.145 --> 24:40.062
my bike, my bar, everything.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.113
Listen, just
do me a favor.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.781
Do not let me
deal away

24:50.906 --> 24:52.325
my last hundred bucks
on Earth, okay?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.205
Deal me in.

Okay, listen, I didn't have

The bouncer was a complete jerk.
He said my name wasn't on

26:36.095 --> 26:37.179
the guest list.
I didn't put your name

26:37.304 --> 26:39.973
on the guest list.
I was hoping to slip out
of here and meet you.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.934
Austin, if you don't want me
here, just say it!

26:42.059 --> 26:43.060
It's not that
I don't want you here.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.144
I don't want us not here.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.272
Austin, I didn't know

26:46.397 --> 26:47.523
that you and Marilyn were
acquainted.

26:47.689 --> 26:52.069
Dad, this is Naomi,
my girlfriend.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.279
Nice to meet you.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.489
(whistles)
Um...

26:55.613 --> 26:57.074
Uh, Dad, thanks
for the party,

26:57.199 --> 26:58.658
but we're actually gonna
sneak out of here and...

26:58.784 --> 27:01.161
Oh, come on, son,
if your girlfriend went

27:01.287 --> 27:02.538
to this much trouble to meet me,

27:02.662 --> 27:05.040
I think she deserves
a little face time

27:05.165 --> 27:06.041
with the King of Country!

27:06.166 --> 27:07.209
(Naomi chuckles)

27:07.334 --> 27:10.212
Look at this, everybody.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.924
My son got himself a
good-looking girlfriend!

27:14.049 --> 27:15.134
(laughter)

27:15.259 --> 27:16.718
Trust me, I'm as surprised
as you are.

27:16.843 --> 27:20.598
I'd have to be crazy
to think that my son could

27:20.722 --> 27:23.725
ever reach the level of success
that I've reached in life.

27:23.850 --> 27:28.147
But when I see this gorgeous
knockout on his arm,

27:28.272 --> 27:29.773
I have to think

27:29.898 --> 27:31.775
maybe a little bit
of the old man

27:31.900 --> 27:33.527
might have rubbed off
on him after all.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.237
(laughter)

27:35.362 --> 27:37.323
Let me ask you something,
sweetheart.
Mm-hmm.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.408
Did he drop my name
when he first met you,

27:39.533 --> 27:40.784
or did he wait till
the first date

27:40.909 --> 27:43.329
just to kinda seal the deal?

27:43.454 --> 27:44.788
I know it's a shock
to you, Dad,

27:44.913 --> 27:46.373
but sometimes I get by in life

27:46.499 --> 27:47.707
just fine without dropping
your name.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.295
Oh, relax, son.
I'm just joking with you.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.006
I reckon I forgot to hand him
down my sense of humor.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.715
(laughter)

27:55.841 --> 27:57.717
I guess so.
We're gonna get
out of here.

27:57.843 --> 28:03.015
Hold on, son. Your birthday is
a very special opportunity

28:03.140 --> 28:05.142
for you to spend a little
one-on-one time

28:05.267 --> 28:06.726
with dear old Dad.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.605
Not to mention I canceled my
second show to be here with you.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.231
Do you know how much money
that cost me?

28:11.357 --> 28:13.025
No, of course you don't,

28:13.150 --> 28:14.443
'cause you think
it's more important

28:14.568 --> 28:16.069
to spend time
with your girlfriend.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.864
No, no, the two of you
should do

28:18.989 --> 28:22.075
the birthday thing together.
I will see Austin later.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.743
Thank you, Nancy.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.663
You're a real peach.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.793
Come on, son.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.629
It's your night.
Let's go.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.131
I can't believe Navid is hooking
up with some random girl

28:36.256 --> 28:38.050
in Las Vegas, unless...

28:38.175 --> 28:40.093
do you think he's been cheating
on me this whole time?

28:40.219 --> 28:44.473
You're asking the idiot who
thought that it was a good idea

28:44.598 --> 28:45.932
to surprise her globetrotting,
womanizing boyfriend

28:46.058 --> 28:47.434
at a Vegas hotel bar.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.436
Yeah, but come on,
how could you have known

28:49.562 --> 28:51.104
he was some kind
of lying man-whore?

28:51.230 --> 28:54.400
I mean, of course, I couldn't.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.151
Well, whenever you're ready

28:56.276 --> 28:59.279
to make the call and dump him,
I'll be here, probably just

28:59.405 --> 29:01.114
right here
in this spot.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.617
A scotch, please.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.161
Hey.
Hey.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.747
What's wrong?
The date not go well?

29:08.872 --> 29:12.543
It was one of the most romantic
evenings of my life.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.254
So, why exactly
is that sad?

29:15.379 --> 29:19.174
What's the point of dating?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.801
I mean, so I can fall in love
and break up with people

29:21.927 --> 29:24.513
for the rest of my life?
There's no endgame for me,

29:24.638 --> 29:27.182
no big fairy tale
where a prince meets

29:27.307 --> 29:28.559
another prince and they live
happily ever after.

29:28.684 --> 29:32.521
Teddy, you can be
exactly who you are

29:32.646 --> 29:33.980
and have everything you want.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.149
Gay couples get married,
they start families.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.568
It's not about gay marriage.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.862
It's about me being gay married,
you know?

29:40.987 --> 29:42.906
I always pictured myself in
a regular marriage.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.118
The wife, the kids,
the kind of happy family

29:46.243 --> 29:48.787
you see in a catalog.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.248
The kind of family my sister is
gonna have.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.501
(sighs) Things were
so much easier

29:54.627 --> 29:57.546
when I knew what my life was
gonna look like, you know?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.510
Uh, what are you doing?

30:03.636 --> 30:04.886
I refuse to sit here

30:05.011 --> 30:06.888
and see the three of us be
miserable, all right?

30:07.013 --> 30:08.932
This is Las Vegas, damn it!

30:09.057 --> 30:10.976
This is the place where
dreams come true.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.019
(Annie chuckles)

30:30.870 --> 30:33.791
Oh, it's lovely, uh... it's
lovely to finally meet you.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.794
My uncle has said wonderful
things about you.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.171
Oh, you're, you're originally
from Las Vegas, right?

30:39.296 --> 30:40.380
Give me the bag.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.272
I know what you're thinking.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.693
You came all the way
to Vegas to deliver socks.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.736
NAVID:
You have an amazing ability

31:02.861 --> 31:05.905
to read people.
This was a test,
and you passed.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.368
I'm going to tell Amal
you're a good soldier,
you get the job done.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.620
I can promise you, next time
it won't be socks in that bag.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.521
Abs, we're waiting.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.241
I'm all in.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.457
You're either very brave
or very stupid.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.126
And you can either beat four
of a kind or you can't.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.796
(snickers)

32:16.309 --> 32:17.811
Ah, screw it.
Too rich for my blood.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.272
I fold.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.982
Yes! Thank you, thank you!

32:24.150 --> 32:26.862
(phone buzzes)

32:26.986 --> 32:27.905
I gotta go.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.741
Yo, dude, you barely
broke even.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.576
Don't you want to stay and win
the rest of your money back?

32:32.701 --> 32:34.870
Hell, no.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.378
Hey.
How'd you do at poker?

32:43.503 --> 32:44.504
I survived, barely.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.964
Sounds like my night.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.758
Next time I want
to throw my money away,

32:47.883 --> 32:49.927
remind me it's only fun if
it's, like, 20 bucks.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.971
(chuckles)

32:53.096 --> 32:55.223
Whatever we're doing here,
it better have nothing to do

32:55.348 --> 32:56.224
with country music.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.769
Uh, Teddy and Shane
are getting married.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.520
Oh, honey.
Which one of you is pregnant?

33:00.646 --> 33:03.565
Sorry.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.442
I cannot believe I let
you talk me into this.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.779
Guys, this isn't
for keeps, okay?

33:08.904 --> 33:11.156
There's no marriage license.
All right, I just want you

33:11.281 --> 33:14.367
to see what it's like
to stand across the
aisle from another guy.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.704
Just think of it as
a no-stakes dress rehearsal.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.873
So that when the time
really comes,

33:19.998 --> 33:22.083
it won't seem so scary
and unimaginable.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.549
All right, gentlemen,
I have a 90-year-old couple

33:29.675 --> 33:31.134
waiting to renew
their wedding vows.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.302
So you ready?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.929
We're ready.
Yep

33:34.053 --> 33:35.263
We'd like to say
our own vows.
We would?

33:35.388 --> 33:38.642
Just speak
from the heart.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.606
First of all, I'd like
to thank Elvis.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.859
This wedding would definitely
not be the same without you.

33:46.984 --> 33:47.943
Thank you,

33:48.067 --> 33:49.319
thank you very much.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.739
Teddy, I know standing up
here is scary for you.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.408
And considering I've seen
you cliff dive in Spain,

33:55.534 --> 33:57.619
I know you're a guy who doesn't
get scared of many things.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.664
Being brave doesn't
mean not being afraid.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.124
It means being afraid
but doing it anyways.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.669
Which is why I'm more
impressed with you right now

34:05.794 --> 34:07.295
than I was in Spain.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.589
That was
absolutely
beautiful.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.632
Groom number two,
what do you got?

34:11.757 --> 34:14.177
Uh... (clearing throat)

34:14.302 --> 34:17.639
Okay, so here I am, and yeah,
I'm freaking out a little bit.

34:17.764 --> 34:21.226
Nothing about this
is what I imagined
my wedding to be.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.062
Everything's changed.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.398
Except for you.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.525
That video camera
glued to your face.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.652
Because what would
my wedding be without

34:31.777 --> 34:33.154
Silver and her video camera?

34:33.279 --> 34:36.449
Or without all of you
here supporting me.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.659
No problem.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.538
Accepting me, making me
feel like it doesn't matter

34:41.663 --> 34:44.833
if this isn't exactly
what I pictured.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.085
So yeah,

34:47.210 --> 34:51.464
I'm standing in a wedding chapel
in Las Vegas

34:51.590 --> 34:53.425
being married to a dude.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.929
By another dude
dressed like Elvis.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.264
(laughter)

35:03.936 --> 35:05.311
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.272
Yeah!

35:07.397 --> 35:09.482
(applause)

35:09.608 --> 35:11.484
Brothers,
by the power of this suit,

35:11.610 --> 35:13.904
I now pronounce you
groom and groom.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.544
(door opening)

35:34.091 --> 35:36.009
Dixon?

35:37.343 --> 35:39.805
What is happening to me?

35:42.348 --> 35:44.977
Everything is going
to be okay.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.352
I'm here.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.604
Thank you.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.444
I'm here.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.102
(cheering)

36:27.226 --> 36:28.645
To Teddy and Shane!

36:28.770 --> 36:32.482
Whoo!
To Teddy and Shane!

36:32.607 --> 36:36.987
Oh, man, it was the most
beautiful wedding two men
have ever had in Vegas.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.114
Well, I couldn't and wouldn't
have done it without you--

36:39.238 --> 36:40.281
all of you.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.159
Oh. Cheers to that.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.827
Yeah, congrats.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.204
Hey, uh, have you
seen my brother?

36:46.329 --> 36:49.041
Uh, not since I gave him my last
poker chip for safekeeping.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.668
Liam, you gave my gambling
addict brother a poker chip

36:51.793 --> 36:53.586
and sent him off
on his own in Las Vegas?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.547
God!

36:58.341 --> 36:59.509
Hey.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.887
So how was

37:02.012 --> 37:03.930
country music legend
Judd Ridge? Tell me.

37:04.056 --> 37:07.142
The only thing legendary about
that guy is what a jerk he is.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.685
It's Austin's birthday.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.228
He made everything about him.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.646
I mean, can you imagine having
a dad like that?

37:11.771 --> 37:14.149
No. Somebody needs
to put him in his place.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.695
Good idea.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.780
Uh... okay.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.868
Hey, Mr. Country Legend,
you may be rich and famous,

37:24.993 --> 37:27.162
but the best thing
you have is your son.

37:27.286 --> 37:29.288
Of course you wouldn't know it
the way you treat him.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.749
Nobody even knows that you're
his father. He keeps it secret

37:30.874 --> 37:33.543
'cause you are
such a giant ass.
(clearing throat)

37:35.670 --> 37:37.547
That was very
touching, sweetheart.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.969
Your girlfriend's got
brass balls, son.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.764
Maybe you could
learn something from her.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.019
I can't believe
you just did that.

37:51.144 --> 37:54.064
Yeah, I can't either.
Someone needed to.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.234
And you thought it should be
you? What, do you think

37:57.358 --> 38:00.612
I've been waiting my whole
life for Ms. Naomi Clark
to stand up to my dad?

38:00.737 --> 38:04.116
The way that man treats
you. Austin, I was just
trying to help.

38:04.241 --> 38:05.992
Then you should have
stayed the hell out of it.

38:06.118 --> 38:09.495
I know my dad, you don't.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.123
And you didn't help.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.250
You just made it worse.

38:21.841 --> 38:25.595
Dixon, are you here?

38:27.973 --> 38:30.642
Oh, my God.
Annie.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.978
Uh...

38:33.103 --> 38:35.354
Well, I can explain.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.564
What is she doing here?

38:36.689 --> 38:38.984
Did she bring drugs
into our hotel room?

38:39.109 --> 38:41.111
Annie, no...

38:41.236 --> 38:43.696
Nobody invited you here, okay?
God, I cannot believe

38:43.822 --> 38:45.282
how stupid all of us were

38:45.406 --> 38:47.159
to think that you could not sink
any lower.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.244
I'm sorry.
Hey, no.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.079
You don't have to do that.

38:51.204 --> 38:54.207
Annie, those are my drugs.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.709
Look, the truth is, I've been
using ADHD medication

38:56.835 --> 38:58.586
and I can't stop.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.631
I've tried, but Adrianna's
actually been trying to help me.

39:04.843 --> 39:09.222
So you knew that my brother
had a drug problem

39:09.347 --> 39:11.724
and you said nothing?

39:11.850 --> 39:13.810
How was I supposed to tell
you about Dixon's problem,

39:13.935 --> 39:15.103
when you won't
even speak to me?

39:15.228 --> 39:18.190
Yeah, I did something
horrible to Silver.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.775
But I'm tired of walking
around feeling like I'm

39:20.900 --> 39:22.443
some terrible person
when I'm not.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.279
Okay, you know what?

39:24.403 --> 39:28.449
It doesn't even matter.
What matters is helping Dixon.

39:28.574 --> 39:33.079
I was there for him,
you weren't.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.248
Ade, you really
don't have to go.

39:35.373 --> 39:39.085
I'll be there for you
when you get back to L.A.

39:39.211 --> 39:43.548
(door opens and closes)

39:54.017 --> 39:56.186
Hey, so did you
talk to Austin?

39:56.311 --> 39:59.189
I suggested we work things
out in the limo on the way
to the airport,

39:59.314 --> 40:01.233
but his dad is making
him stay in Vegas.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.026
His birthday
totally sucked.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.362
Dude, I'm so sorry you
lost all that money.
I'm not.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.073
Guys like you, you've been
fortunate your whole lives.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.200
You know how to
handle it, but me,

40:10.325 --> 40:12.535
for the first time in my
life I've actually got

40:12.660 --> 40:15.288
something to lose, and it only
cost me ten grand to realize it.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.664
I got off cheap.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.457
I'm so hungover.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.835
Did we get married last night?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.546
Yeah. That was
very Vegas of us.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.965
Listen, that trip was
unbelievable,

40:26.091 --> 40:28.426
but since we're going back
to L.A. and the campaign...

40:28.551 --> 40:31.012
What happens in Vegas.
I completely agree.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.890
Look, I don't want you
to worry, okay?

40:34.015 --> 40:36.601
(phone rings)
There are a lot of great
facilities in L.A.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.395
Wait, you mean rehab?

40:38.519 --> 40:40.939
Annie, Annie, th-that's
crazy expensive.

40:41.064 --> 40:45.735
Uh, I only care about
you getting better, okay?
So let me handle this.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.529
Hey, Patrick.
I miss you, too.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.200
I know. I'm so sorry, Marissa.

40:52.325 --> 40:53.659
I thought I already sent
the videos.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.371
But I'm sending you finished
ones right now.

40:56.495 --> 40:58.164
Okay, bye.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.750
NAOMI:
Silver, hurry up.

41:00.875 --> 41:01.876
I'm not going to hold
the jet for you.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.337
I'm coming.
Give me two seconds.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.755
Interview 15.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.216
Silver?
Coming.

41:08.341 --> 41:09.842
Interview 14.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.475
I need a vacation.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.477
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

41:19.602 --> 41:22.355
and FORD. Drive One.
