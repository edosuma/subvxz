Hmm.

Room temperature...
very interesting.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.102
Tight knots, guys.
We need maximum rope tension

04:14.170 --> 04:16.204
to eliminate trap torsion.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.178
Oh!

04:24.213 --> 04:25.947

06:17.660 --> 06:20.094
Why?!

06:23.122 --> 06:26.124
All right. Now, let me
get this straight.

06:26.192 --> 06:29.361
These t-shirts are $50 each.

got all these crazy emotions,

06:52.919 --> 06:56.221
and I don't know why.
Am I upset over my trap not working?

06:56.289 --> 06:58.256
Or is it because Daphne's gone?

06:58.324 --> 07:01.159

07:21.781 --> 07:23.481
Uh, absolutely not.
For starters,

07:23.549 --> 07:25.417
I'm gonna take a couple of
these Hex Girl t-shirts

07:25.484 --> 07:28.620

and then I'm gonna call the Mayor.

07:56.749 --> 07:59.851

08:10.696 --> 08:12.397

Wait a sec. Why is there
lotion on these ropes?

08:15.868 --> 08:19.337
I don't moisturize.
This can only mean one thing...

08:19.405 --> 08:23.508

wasn't my fault!

08:25.678 --> 08:28.546

My job as Mayor...

what I interpret that to be.

08:58.744 --> 09:01.212

09:01.280 --> 09:03.281
So, leave the phantom
alone, Fred.

09:03.349 --> 09:06.518
He's good for business.
But you don't understand.

09:06.585 --> 09:09.321

- Daphne.

09:16.128 --> 09:18.229

09:18.297 --> 09:20.565
Wish you didn't care

09:20.633 --> 09:23.034

09:23.102 --> 09:24.736

for your traps.

it's too dangerous

09:28.574 --> 09:30.508
It's time to cancel the tour.

Or I could just do it myself.

Don't you see?
Uh, no.

11:37.269 --> 11:39.671
You can't go on
tomorrow night. It's too risky.

11:39.738 --> 11:42.173
Don't tell me what to do,
Fred. I can go on.

11:42.241 --> 11:44.175

- It's crush.

11:48.481 --> 11:51.082

11:51.150 --> 11:53.985

That's the first time you
stood up for yourself with Fred,

11:56.722 --> 11:57.856

11:57.923 --> 12:00.391
Are you ok?
Truth?

12:00.459 --> 12:01.726
No.

12:03.796 --> 12:05.463

12:14.573 --> 12:16.608
Aah! You're right!

12:16.675 --> 12:18.610
Run away! Run away!

12:20.846 --> 12:22.881
If you had a lizard face,

12:22.948 --> 12:25.316
I'd still love you, Scooby.

12:25.384 --> 12:27.452
And I'd love you, Harry.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.255
More sandwich?

12:30.322 --> 12:32.524
Ok. Like, you know what?
Enough.

12:32.591 --> 12:34.726
You can't replace me
with a dummy.

12:34.793 --> 12:37.395
Do you hear something, Harry?

12:37.463 --> 12:39.797
There is no Harry.
Harry is you.

12:39.865 --> 12:42.500
And, like, dude,
I am your best friend.

12:42.568 --> 12:44.903
Um, no. I don't think so.

12:44.970 --> 12:47.205
Why don't you just
stay out of it, Harry?

12:47.273 --> 12:49.841
And, like, stop watching
Vincent van Ghoul movies.

12:49.909 --> 12:52.076
That's mine
and Scooby-Doo's thing.

12:52.144 --> 12:54.145
Really?
Well, Scooby thought

12:54.213 --> 12:57.048
you cared more about girls
and going to proms.

13:00.052 --> 13:02.220
Get him, Harry.

13:04.957 --> 13:07.859
Wait. What am I doing?
You're just a puppet!

13:07.927 --> 13:10.261
You can't fight back, puppet!

13:10.329 --> 13:12.297
Uhh, uhh, uhh!

13:14.967 --> 13:18.403
What is this
on the floor I see?

13:18.470 --> 13:20.338
One head or 3?

13:20.406 --> 13:22.874
Soon dead they'll be.

13:22.942 --> 13:25.777
It's... it's... it's...

13:25.844 --> 13:28.012
The phantom!

13:32.898 --> 13:34.498
Run, Harry!

13:34.566 --> 13:36.233
- H-harry?

13:52.684 --> 13:54.351
Scoob.

14:04.596 --> 14:07.598
We should, like, check to see
if he's gone.

14:07.666 --> 14:10.034
- Uh-uh. Not me.
Not gonna do it.

14:10.101 --> 14:12.102
Well, I'm not gonna do it,
either.

14:14.439 --> 14:17.842
Hmm. Something's burning.

14:17.909 --> 14:19.510
Huh?
Huh?

14:19.578 --> 14:21.178
Yeah. Us!

14:21.246 --> 14:23.581
Yikes!

14:23.648 --> 14:25.349
Like, we're trapped!

14:25.417 --> 14:28.085
Help, Harry! Save us!

14:28.153 --> 14:30.554
Hey! Good thinking, scoob!

14:30.622 --> 14:32.323
Unh!

14:34.559 --> 14:36.827
Oh.

14:40.732 --> 14:44.268
Aw, you saved me.

14:44.336 --> 14:46.904
Like, it's no big deal.

14:46.972 --> 14:49.073
Thank you, Harry.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.709
Harry?! What about me?

14:51.776 --> 14:53.878
Hey. What's this?

14:53.945 --> 14:56.514
It's a piece of
the phantom's robe. Huh.

14:56.581 --> 14:59.450

this material before.

And look. Fantzee Pantz
had the same manager

15:17.035 --> 15:19.670
as the Hex Girls...
Gus Boggs.

15:19.738 --> 15:21.272
Boggs could be the phantom.

15:21.339 --> 15:23.007
Harry, get him again.

15:40.559 --> 15:43.027
Heh heh heh. Groovy chiclets.

15:43.094 --> 15:45.429
Fantzee Pantz
went down the rabbit hole

15:45.497 --> 15:47.831
after the record gods
dumped him

15:47.899 --> 15:50.434
to make room for the Hex Girls.

15:50.502 --> 15:54.638
Poor fantzee.
We knew him well.

15:54.706 --> 15:56.407
What do we do now, Fred?

15:56.474 --> 15:58.542
I'm sure Harry will save us.

15:58.610 --> 16:00.611
Harry is not saving...

16:00.679 --> 16:04.214
hold on, Shaggy. Maybe Harry
is exactly what we need.

16:12.624 --> 16:14.058
Stop. Stop!

16:14.125 --> 16:16.226
It still doesn't feel right.

16:17.562 --> 16:20.331
Luna, dusk,
why don't you take five?

16:20.398 --> 16:23.200
I'm sorry, Thorn.
I know you were counting on me.

16:23.268 --> 16:26.070
That's ok.
I know what's going on.

16:26.137 --> 16:28.172
We've all had a Fred
in our lives.

16:28.239 --> 16:31.842
Mine was a carny I met on the
road named knuckles Wazinski.

16:31.910 --> 16:34.878
He ran the roundup.
You know that ride that spins around,

16:34.946 --> 16:37.281
pinning you to the wall
till you puke?

16:37.349 --> 16:39.116
Loved it more than me.

16:39.184 --> 16:41.552
Last time I saw knuckles,
he was going 60 miles an hour

16:41.620 --> 16:44.388
covered in a 4-year-old's
chili cheese fries.

16:44.456 --> 16:47.157
You know how I got over him?
You cut the brake lines on his van.

16:47.225 --> 16:49.727
No. I got over it
with a song.

16:49.794 --> 16:52.563

19:38.296 --> 19:40.397
I warn you.

19:40.465 --> 19:42.232
And you disobey.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.470
So, this will be
your dying day.

19:50.575 --> 19:51.875
Huh?

19:51.943 --> 19:53.944
Oh! Uhh!

19:57.682 --> 19:59.850
Gotcha!

19:59.918 --> 20:02.853
- Bug-eyed biscuits, Fred.
Couldn't you have waited

20:02.921 --> 20:05.189
until after the show
to catch the phantom?

20:05.256 --> 20:07.724
Sorry, dad.
Not with Daphne in danger.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.994
Daniel Frizette?

20:11.062 --> 20:13.564
Or, like, should we call you
Fantzee Pantz?

20:13.631 --> 20:15.332
Fantzee Pantz?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.301
Doth my eye shadow deceive?

20:17.368 --> 20:18.902
How did you know?

20:18.970 --> 20:21.572
The phantom had to be someone
close to the Hex Girls

20:21.639 --> 20:24.041
to access the stage.

20:25.276 --> 20:28.111
And the Hex Girls' equipment.

20:28.179 --> 20:30.347
And their bus.

20:32.851 --> 20:35.786
Someone with a grudge
against the Hex Girls.

20:35.854 --> 20:37.888
The Hex Girls took my career.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.624
I tried to get revenge
by writing bad songs for them,

20:40.692 --> 20:43.227
but they can make anything
a hit.

20:43.294 --> 20:45.729
So, I became the phantom.
And I'd do it again

20:45.797 --> 20:48.098
if it weren't for the uncanny
boy band knowledge

20:48.166 --> 20:49.833
of you meddling brats!

20:49.901 --> 20:51.969
Let's go.

21:04.649 --> 21:07.317
Well, I guess
my rock star days are over.

21:07.385 --> 21:09.052
Hey, for what it's worth, Daph,

21:09.120 --> 21:10.988
I thought your song
was amazing.

21:11.055 --> 21:13.323
Really, Fred? You did?

21:13.391 --> 21:15.692
Yeah.
And if you want to break free,

21:15.760 --> 21:17.761
hey, I'm not gonna stop you.

21:17.829 --> 21:20.163
But I'm also not gonna hide
the fact that I have feelings

21:20.231 --> 21:22.466
for traps and you.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.501
Call me a non-man if you want,

21:24.569 --> 21:26.470
a caring un-guy,

21:26.537 --> 21:28.405
whatever the street slang is.

21:28.473 --> 21:30.407
I just know
that when you're in danger,

21:30.475 --> 21:32.476
for reasons I can't explain,

21:32.543 --> 21:35.145
I hurt.
Does that make sense?

21:35.213 --> 21:37.881
If it were coming from
anyone else, no.

21:37.949 --> 21:41.285
But from you, Freddy,
it's crystal clear.

21:41.352 --> 21:44.454
So, like,
sorry about Harry, Scoob,

21:44.522 --> 21:47.357
him being stuck to Daniel and
all and being taken to prison.

21:47.425 --> 21:49.593
I know that dummy
meant a lot to you.

21:49.661 --> 21:53.130
Hey, you're the only dummy
I need, Shaggy.

21:53.197 --> 21:54.798
Really? You mean it?

21:54.866 --> 21:57.301
Gimme some paw, Scoob.

21:59.203 --> 22:02.372
