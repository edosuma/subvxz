00:08.717 --> 00:10.343
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.427 --> 00:11.636
Let's get you divorced.

00:11.720 --> 00:16.557
We need to demonstrate
that Kevin is an unfit custodian.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.601
lf l'd wanted a partner, l'd have one.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.019
That's not what l want.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.562
Well, then what is it?

00:21.647 --> 00:23.356
lf l can help, let me help.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.733
Your file is empty.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.405
Shit.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.122
Wait, you're the friend from rehab?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.729
What did he have?

01:44.813 --> 01:47.315
A Vicodin smoothie for lunch.
l don't know what happened after that.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.150
Gotta wake him up. His breathing is slow.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.569
Charlie, eyes open.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.321
Come on, stay with me.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.781
Stay with me, Charlie.

01:54.865 --> 01:55.907
Just turn on the water.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.742
Come on, stay with me.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.910
-That's hot!
-l'm sorry!

01:58.994 --> 02:00.036
That's fucking hot!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.913
Jesus, shit. These knobs are in French.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.248
Come on. Come on, buddy. Eyes open.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.042
Are you awake? Come on, eyes alive.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.335
Come on. Sit up, sit up.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.544
You sit up.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.047
Look at me. Talk to me.
Where did you get the drugs?

02:11.173 --> 02:12.465
Let's hold off on the questions.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.591
Back off!

02:13.675 --> 02:15.092
You know, it's hard to get shit.

02:15.177 --> 02:19.013
l don't work at a hospital
fucking a pharmacist.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.105
Where are your towels?

02:28.690 --> 02:31.275
-Hi.
-Hi. They're out.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.403
But l let them watch Dirty Dancing
edited for TV.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.739
No swears, no abortion scene.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.616
Great. Listen, l'm kind of tied up here.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.201
Are you on a hot date?

02:40.452 --> 02:41.494
Yeah, sure.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.204
The guy's an oil baron.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.665
Oh, my God, l was kidding. You are?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.291
Can you talk? What's going on?

02:47.376 --> 02:49.293
Listen, can you get the girls
off to school in the morning?

02:49.378 --> 02:50.628
Just tell them l took a night shift.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.547
On it. Lunches are already made.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.756
All right. Thanks, Zoey.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.639
Want to take another walk
around the apartment, move around a little?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.140
No.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.600
So, what, now you're on the outside

03:04.685 --> 03:07.061
and it's the whole rehab
cover-for-me buddy system?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.230
How could l possibly know it was your kid?
lt's anonymous.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.276
Nobody's covering for anybody.
We met in rehab, we go to AA.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.279
-You're pissed. l get it.
-You get it?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.990
Great. l'm playing cards with two addicts.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.659
Well, l am completely sober.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.412
Yeah? Well, good for you.
How come you and not him?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.876
Charlie, honey, is there any part of you
that's willing to go back to Wexler?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.752
Come on, how many times
are we gonna do this?

03:31.837 --> 03:32.920
As many times as it takes.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.047
You guys can sort your shit out.
l'm going to bed.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.507
Sit back down.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.303
You need to go back in.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.516
Charlie, your dad is sitting right here.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.355
l've always told you the truth,

03:51.440 --> 03:54.025
and l'm telling you
what l think you should do.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.652
That's all l got.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.449
Will you go?

04:05.120 --> 04:07.163
Promise me you're not gonna fire her.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.169
Yes, l promise.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.547
Then, yeah, l'll go.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.267
l don't want to tell you what to do,
but you might want to take his phone.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.021
Hey. Give me your phone.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.322
Hey, fourth time's a charm.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.658
-lt's my fifth.
-Fifth time's a charm. We're getting there.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.578
Yep, me and my chronic relapse bullshit.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.872
How about you? How are you doing?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.626
You know, one day at a time.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.588
-Hey.
-What?

04:57.673 --> 04:59.298
You want to hug me?

04:59.383 --> 05:00.424
Yeah.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.717
Don't, okay?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.971
l'll see you on Sunday.
l'll fucking hug you on Sunday.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.568
Why don't you take the train?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.780
-Really?
-l think it's better that way.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.035
Yeah, you're right. lt's probably faster.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.959
lt's hot as balls in here.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.877
You want some fan?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.718
How are you not sweating? So jealous.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.553
Don't be. Diabetic nerve damage.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.848
Sometimes my sweat glands don't work.
lt's a joy.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.266
Still,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.519
l start to sweat when l worry
about people noticing my sweat.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.771
Gloria, can't you do something?

05:57.441 --> 05:59.900
l no longer have the authority
to fix such a problem.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.987
You know what's great about the train?
You have a chance to grab a cup of coffee.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.989
Be very careful
about how you talk to me today.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.574
l'm trying to keep a promise to my kid.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.160
Oil baron.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.369
What are you talking about?

06:10.454 --> 06:13.247
-Why is it so hot in here?
-You tell me.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.668
You remember the last time there was
a mandatory drug screening for the nurses?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.086
-Yes.
-Date?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.632
October 14th. See?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.552
Because l drew a little cup of pee.

06:26.970 --> 06:31.223
Yeah, l'd like to review the security footage
for the week of October 14th, last year.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.516
The ER, yeah.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.602
l've got clearance.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.937
l'm the one who grants clearance.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.485
Yes, l'm sure that doesn't line up
with your protocol.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.779
We divert to the pharmacy on three
with a Post-it?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.198
lf Eddie's going
to have somebody cover the ER,

06:47.282 --> 06:48.574
he's gonna have to do better than this.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.204
You know, l have
a lot of experience with maintenance,

06:53.288 --> 06:56.540
and l'm sure if l work with them
on this air-conditioning situation...

06:56.625 --> 06:59.752
Surely there's someone other than you
who can handle this.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.962
l'm sure there is.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.299
Good luck finding them.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.177
And again.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.597
All right, when did you
start having trouble swallowing?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.474
A week ago.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.893
BP's a little high. lt's 1 30 over 90.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.311
That's better than it was yesterday.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.564
Right, Mrs. Zimberger,
l think we should start with a tonsil biopsy.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.025
Just take them, dear, will you, please?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.903
-Beg your pardon?
-Just take them out.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.029
You can do that, can't you?

07:27.531 --> 07:30.366
Well, you know, elective surgeries
aren't usually covered by insurance.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.577
l'm 87.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.498
l should get to spend my money
the way l want to, don't you think?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.627
l'll check the schedule.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.090
How about a popsicle?

07:46.383 --> 07:50.845
Yeah. l don't like grape,
and l prefer cherry or banana to orange.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.098
But if you only have orange, that's fine.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.307
Okay.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.727
Make sure the banana is not lemon-flavored.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.313
-Okay.
-They're both yellow.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.275
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.402
l'll see what we have.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.903
Thank you.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.114
l think Cruz is going to fire me.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.282
Why do you say that?

08:11.366 --> 08:14.076
Because he knows about rehab.
He knows more about me than he should.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.912
He's not gonna fire you
for getting treatment.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.873
Yeah, l guess you're right.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.833
Did you go out and buy that dress?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.918
Yep, the minute l came in here.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.130
l refuse to be more uncomfortable
than l already am.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.923
By the way,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.926
l've got my scan today.
Any chance you're free later?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.138
Today? No, not with Cruz on my ass.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.225
Yeah, no. Got it. You've got a job to keep.
Totally understand.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.643
l'm sorry.

08:39.728 --> 08:40.895
lt's fine.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.402
What do you got there?

08:49.487 --> 08:52.573
Returning her books.
That's sad, man, but a healthy step.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.325
No, it's mine.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.160
Dude, no, no, no.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.037
This is not a time to Eat, Pray, Love.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.247
This is a time
to sleep with hot yoga instructors.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.752
Look, l know it's a chick book,
but every page l read is like, "Exactly."

09:05.670 --> 09:08.172
l'm going to Greece. My cousin lives there.
l can stay with him for free.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.340
Bought my ticket.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.507
Hi.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.134
Lenny's going to Greece.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.094
When? You're leaving?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.721
Temporarily.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.264
Not just because of you.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.143
l'm getting a little burned out on helping
people who usually scream at me.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.355
But how are we going to be awesome exes
if you're not here?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.524
You can be awesome without me.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.240
l thought he was doing better.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.784
Yeah. Well, sometimes you go to sleep
thinking you're okay,

09:36.868 --> 09:40.663
and then you're like, "Wow, not okay."

09:55.971 --> 09:58.931
Hey. l need security footage
from the HR office.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.267
Yeah, now.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.938
You never witnessed Jackie Peyton
taking drugs in front of her children?

10:06.022 --> 10:07.606
-Not once?
-No.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.402
Look, l don't want to be difficult here,
but l'm under oath, right?

10:11.486 --> 10:12.528
Right.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.823
Who initiated the affair four years ago?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.784
That would be her. She did.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.245
l really don't want to get into the specifics.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.746
Do we need to know this?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.123
Establishing pattern.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.209
Mr. Walzer, when did she disclose
that she had a family?

10:27.335 --> 10:29.628
Jackie doesn't disclose things.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.213
You find shit out.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.090
Listen, man,

10:33.174 --> 10:36.468
l told you l'd come here
and tell your lawyer what l told you.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.970
l did that.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.471
Can we be done here?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.307
Because l want to be done with you.

10:46.396 --> 10:50.149
Okay, so l think one is lemon
and one is banana, so l brought you both.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.319
You're a doll.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
Banana.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.996
You were with my husband
when he was here.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.124
Oh, God, that's right.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.002
l'm sorry l didn't remember sooner.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.296
That's all right. lt happens a lot.

11:13.381 --> 11:18.886
We were married for so long that it's hard
for people to remember me without him.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.431
Mrs. Zimberger, are you sure
you want to go through with this surgery?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.934
Honey, how old are you? 35?

11:27.062 --> 11:29.897
-You're sweet.
-Well, l'm not 35.

11:29.981 --> 11:34.777
And l tell you, if l have cancer,
l have no intention of treating it.

11:34.903 --> 11:40.491
My kids live out on the West Coast
and l miss my husband.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.412
So if l get in there
and it turns out this body can't handle...

11:45.497 --> 11:46.830
l don't know, what do you call it?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.415
Tonsillectomy.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.085
Then maybe it's my time.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.755
Thank you for the popsicle.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.383
So left hip looks good.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.927
l know. Otherwise, l couldn't do this.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.347
You're cute.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.640
Now, put that away.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.102
So you're a dancer.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.105
l'm on tour with Lady Gaga. Best job ever.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.190
And then my fucking hip
gives way in rehearsal.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.526
-lt's fine, right?
-Well, it's not good

12:15.610 --> 12:17.444
and l don't think hip resurfacing's
gonna do it,

12:17.529 --> 12:19.279
so we should discuss replacement.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.949
No, no way. No replacement.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.159
Okay, then no walking. Call ortho.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.454
Excuse me.

12:28.456 --> 12:32.960
Hey, l know you had a rough night.
Don't take it out on everybody here.

12:39.968 --> 12:40.968
"See me."

12:41.678 --> 12:42.845
You believe this shit?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.054
Yeah.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.515
Listen, Kevin's lawyer deposed me today.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.809
-What?
-You've got nothing to worry about.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.437
What kind of fucking character witness
am l, really?

12:51.729 --> 12:54.565
l fucked the guy's wife,
l pretended to be friends with him.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.818
Where are you going?
Jackie, listen. Hold on.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.571
Just hold on, okay?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.406
Here's what l didn't tell them.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.161
When l went over there,
when Kevin beat the crap out of me,

13:07.579 --> 13:09.121
the girls were there.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.790
l mean, they were playing
that dance video game,

13:11.875 --> 13:14.001
but they were there maybe 1 0 feet away.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.880
There you go.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.217
There's blood in the water now.
Your lawyer, she'll bite.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.275
No, darling, of course l understand. Yeah.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.738
Yeah.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.203
l've got to dash, all right.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.913
l know.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.874
Did you sound even more Britishy just then?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.043
My sister.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.962
Your sister? ls she coming for holiday?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.964
Don't.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.091
She was. She canceled.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.301
Bummer. You sad?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.473
What's that?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.726
What To Expect When You're Expecting.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.855
Well, l don't need this.
l'm expecting to have a baby.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.482
No, keep it. l annotated it for you.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.319
l think the expectations are yours.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.030
Hey, l don't see you surrounded
by a lot of people right now.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.574
l'm trying to be supportive.
But if you don't need anything, l'll go.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.414
Drink that.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.418
Thought you might need this.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.128
You're a godsend.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.925
Listen, are you by any chance free
after your shift today?

14:45.260 --> 14:47.511
Nope. Gotta work a double. Keep hydrating.

14:50.932 --> 14:51.974
Shit.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.393
We've been working
with the DEA and the NYPD

14:54.477 --> 14:56.687
on an internal
narcotics shrinkage investigation,

14:56.771 --> 14:59.356
and l have reason to believe
that you're a big part of my problem.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.193
You've been working here a long time
and l fully expect your cooperation,

15:03.278 --> 15:04.444
even after you're fired.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.113
l'm fired?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.033
l left the pharmacy for three hours today.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.326
lt's not about today.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.662
Security is gonna walk you out of here,
but before they do,

15:13.746 --> 15:14.997
you're gonna talk to a few people.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.166
l've been spending the whole fucking day

15:18.251 --> 15:21.795
talking to people l don't want to talk to
about things l don't want to talk about.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.590
Fine, bring them in.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.883
What am l gonna do, say, "No"?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.677
Ask your questions.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.974
Everybody that l know who's had
a hip replacement comes out beautifully.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.226
Thanks, but l'm not 80.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.520
Which is why you'll be fine.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.190
Suzanne Farrell, Bebe Neuwirth,
Rudy Galindo,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.152
a bunch ofAlvin Ailey dancers.
See? You're in good company.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.903
Seriously?

15:47.780 --> 15:51.450
When l was diagnosed with type 1 ,
l was all criabetes.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.412
Knowing famous people had it, too,
made me feel better.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.625
-l don't know what to do.
-You just keep going.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.878
Sometimes you don't get
to keep everything you started out with.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.720
Here.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.847
Shut up. Here.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.434
They're euros. l think it's, like, $30.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.687
l waited in line at the bank.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.857
Damn it.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.193
Awesome exes.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
No matter where you go,

16:31.741 --> 16:35.911
l'll be right here.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.372
So creepy.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.706
l think l'm gonna puke.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.832
Me, too.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.378
l'm so sorry.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.712
l got the tickets four months ago.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.298
No, Book ofMormon trumps unborn child,
got it.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.884
l just love that you are walking me to my car.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.552
Ask him.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.184
Just go and watch your musical
and stop making trouble.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.940
Are you done for the day?

17:05.024 --> 17:06.149
Put a fork in me.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.526
Are you doing anything right now?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.736
No, nothing. Totally free.

17:11.864 --> 17:17.327
Would you be willing to come
to my anatomy scan with me?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.330
Really?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.919
You don't even have to ask.
You know that, right?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.505
l thought you were gonna ask me
to carry something heavy.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.926
l'll get in the front.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.179
We're having a baby!

17:42.478 --> 17:43.687
You wanted to see me?

17:43.771 --> 17:44.980
Yeah. Hey, come on in. Close the door.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.319
Take a look at this. Come here.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.490
Tell me what l'm looking at.

17:57.869 --> 18:01.121
A security feed from six months ago.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.457
That's a hallway.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.333
That's HR.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.921
And that's Gloria Akalitus
dumping your urine specimen.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.011
-You don't know that.
-l do, actually.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.305
Date, time stamp. lt's all right there.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.017
You can't be surrounded by people
who enabled your habit,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.144
handed you drugs, covered your tracks.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.229
And l can't have people like that
working for me.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.107
Yeah, okay, well, they also
enabled me to get better.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.527
Please, l know how it looks.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.238
How it is, not how it looks.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.574
-Just a minute.
-lf you're gonna fire me, then just do it.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.785
l'm not gonna fire you.
You're gonna watch this, though.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.244
Come on in.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.081
-You had me paged?
-Yeah. Hey, Gloria.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.666
Come on in. Have a seat.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.336
-No, Gloria, don't have a seat.
-Jackie,

18:50.087 --> 18:51.546
a little respect.

18:53.925 --> 18:57.928
So l've finally figured out
why Jackie doesn't have a file.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.388
This is security footage
from six months ago.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.600
l'm gonna need your badge
and you'll have to leave immediately, today.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.769
We'll figure out a date with HR
for you to come back in,

19:05.853 --> 19:07.896
and pick up your stuff,
have your exit interview.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.732
Your pension will remain intact
because l do, in fact, have a heart.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.529
You'll be difficult to replace. l do know that.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.197
Difficult to replace? Really?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.032
Do you have any fucking idea
what you're talking about?

19:19.408 --> 19:22.118
Jackie, it's fine. lt's a job.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.663
No, it's not all right.
She's been here 30 years.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.706
Do you know how many idiots
have tried to fire her,

19:27.041 --> 19:29.459
only to realize what a stupid idea that is?

19:29.544 --> 19:32.712
Many, many have tried.
You're the first to succeed.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.969
Finally.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.595
l've been waiting for the air all day.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.849
Look, fire me, okay?
lt wasn't her, it wasn't Eddie.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.559
That's not a good idea

19:45.643 --> 19:46.810
in the middle of a custody battle.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.145
-He's right.
-Gloria, l didn't know.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.314
l didn't say anything. He just found...

19:51.399 --> 19:54.025
Jackie, l know that. Let's not do this here.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.988
l will take a few minutes to update my charts
and hand off my patients.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.031
You won't say anything to anyone.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.201
lt's not your news to give.
l don't need any more chaos today.

20:03.536 --> 20:08.081
Understood, Dr. Cruz.
You forget l was an administrator once, too.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.426
To a fresh start.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.513
You can go now.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.652
The snacks are for the pregnant people.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.113
They said it was fine.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.789
He's not the father.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.499
You told me that already.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.628
So we're going to get started

20:55.588 --> 20:58.423
and then the doctor will come in
and talk to you after we get a look, okay?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.425
We're both doctors,
so it's like the doctor is already here.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.218
Stop talking.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.350
Oh, my God, l can't look.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.684
Holy shit.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.063
You can see his face.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.568
He looks like an old man
with a beautiful mouth.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.654
Are you looking? You have to look.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.864
He looks just like you.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.995
l do not look like that.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.997
A little.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.836
Listen,

21:39.840 --> 21:44.260
there is a long list of names
that l run through in my mind

21:44.512 --> 21:46.137
before l even get to yours.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.557
Jackie, my sister,

21:49.642 --> 21:51.559
my neighbor, Joan,
who l've only met three times,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.187
but with whom l feel a certain kinship.
However,

21:55.356 --> 21:58.400
if you wouldn't mind being fifth in line

21:58.484 --> 22:01.987
to be backup person to be
in the delivery room, that would be fine.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.738
Really?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.657
-Never gonna happen.
-But it could

22:05.741 --> 22:08.368
and that's what counts. l...

22:12.206 --> 22:15.041
Oh, my God, you can see his spine.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.505
No way. lt's on again.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.299
Dirty Dancing.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.468
Have you seen it?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.142
Okay, we're watching this.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.734
l don't know why l'm ringing the bell.
What did you say to my lawyer?

22:41.402 --> 22:43.069
-Where are the girls?
-My sister's watching them.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.946
You know, if you're gonna beat
the shit out of somebody,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.073
you probably shouldn't do it
in front of the girls.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.324
They didn't see anything.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.869
Your building has security feeds,
security guards.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.913
There's enough there to put it together
without anybody saying a word.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.750
Who are you?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.626
Zoey.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.088
Why are you making that face?
You think this is funny?

23:02.173 --> 23:05.633
No, l'm... No, l'm...
l was trying to look away and not move.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.844
Kevin, you need to leave.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.057
l've got a laundry list
of all the shitty things you've done, okay?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.851
l'm sure you do. And you know where
we're gonna talk about it from now on?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.645
At a long, shiny wooden table
at my lawyer's office.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.690
And if you are lucky,
you'll get joint custody.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.442
And you know it.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.695
Nobody wins here, Kevin.
You think we can stop this now?

23:27.198 --> 23:28.573
You know what, babe?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.450
Even when you're telling the truth,

23:30.534 --> 23:31.785
it sounds like a lie.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.124
Yeah, we can stop.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.731
l think l should find another place to live.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.985
l think you're a private person

24:06.153 --> 24:09.197
and l'm kind of worried that if l'm here

24:09.990 --> 24:13.493
and l see things that you're not used
to people seeing,

24:14.870 --> 24:16.746
that you're gonna like me less.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.542
You won't mean to,

24:20.918 --> 24:25.463
but l think that will happen, you know?

24:31.679 --> 24:36.182
A friend from rehab relapsed last night,
went back into treatment.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.437
l don't want to do that.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.691
You won't.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.280
Please stay.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.243
Okay.
