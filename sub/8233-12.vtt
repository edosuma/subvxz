Previously on
Witches of East End...

00:03.666 --> 00:05.300
The King promised me if I helped
him, you would be mine.

00:05.333 --> 00:07.000
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

00:07.033 --> 00:09.633
You murdered him,
and I helped you cover it up.

00:09.666 --> 00:12.000
I don't want this thing
to end between us, but I can't

00:12.033 --> 00:14.666
put you in danger.
KILLIAN:
When I found out she was dead

00:14.700 --> 00:16.633
I knew right then,
I couldn't live without her.

00:16.666 --> 00:18.000
MATHIAS: The poison
will cost you your life.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.666
Hello, Joanna.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.000
How could you bring
this man into our home?!

00:22.033 --> 00:23.866
WENDY: He's gonna bring
the girls back.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.800
Was he covered in, tar?
No, it's thinner than tar.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.033
You just admitted
to spying on me?

00:28.066 --> 00:29.233
JOANNA:
We're going to the past.

00:29.266 --> 00:30.900
So now we're gonna use
the time door?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.333
Time door?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.033
Time door? What's a time door?

00:34.066 --> 00:35.633
We need to get something
from the past?

00:35.666 --> 00:37.533
It‐it's something
I used to own.

00:37.566 --> 00:38.700
JOANNA:
We got to leave this instant.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.000
I'm staying.

00:40.033 --> 00:41.066
I almost failed
sophomore English

00:41.100 --> 00:42.233
because of Edgar Allan Poe,

00:42.266 --> 00:43.566
and now you're telling me

00:43.600 --> 00:45.033
I was in love with him?

00:45.066 --> 00:47.666
The Anima Aucupe kills

00:47.700 --> 00:49.133
both the spirit
and the host.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.366
What makes you think
that's gonna work?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.166
'Cause a long time ago,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.133
I used it to kill you.

00:54.166 --> 00:57.633
I'm gonna get the Anima Aucupe
so we can return to East End,

00:57.666 --> 01:00.033
and send your grandfather
straight to hell.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.966
MATHIAS:
The poison will burn you

01:04.000 --> 01:07.233
as if your soul
is being incinerated.

01:10.433 --> 01:13.633
SALINA:
There is no antidote, Killian.

01:13.666 --> 01:15.833

We have had fun along the way,

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
(giggles)
Only every day.

03:00.533 --> 03:03.333
We do know how to make the best
of a bad situation.

03:03.366 --> 03:05.500
We do.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.800
Is it terrible that
I want our father dead?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.866
No.

But if it's peace you think
you'll find in revenge‐‐

03:20.733 --> 03:23.200
there's no
such thing.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.033
We'll kill him
in order to stop him,

03:25.066 --> 03:27.900
but it won't undo
what he did to us.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.700
It won't take the pain away.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.866
You ready?

03:35.900 --> 03:37.333
I should get going.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.666
You both stay here.

03:44.700 --> 03:48.566
Safe and out of sight.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.133
Give me an hour, and
I'll meet you at the time door

04:42.766 --> 04:44.733
The spell worked.

08:15.033 --> 08:18.666
Oh, what kind
of problem?

It seems like she might
be having doubts

08:21.400 --> 08:24.300

08:24.333 --> 08:26.033

This is an appointment

09:34.766 --> 09:36.400
How long have I been asleep?

09:36.433 --> 09:38.533
A couple hours, maybe.

09:38.566 --> 09:41.733

most awful dream.

09:41.766 --> 09:43.900
Killian was dying.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.833
And I had to give
him lotus root.

09:45.866 --> 09:48.500
That's... deeply fascinating,

09:48.533 --> 09:50.833
but w‐we may have
a slight problem.

09:50.866 --> 09:52.633
Hmm?

09:52.666 --> 09:55.033
Okay, I don't want you
to panic or anything,

09:55.066 --> 09:57.300

lost the key.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.200
The key?

09:58.233 --> 10:00.466
The key.
The key?!

10:00.500 --> 10:01.800
Yeah, the key.
The key to the time door.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.033
The key that gets us home.

10:03.066 --> 10:04.700

10:04.733 --> 10:06.200
Do I look like I'm kidding?!

10:06.233 --> 10:07.833
What are we gonna do?
Can we make another one?

10:07.866 --> 10:09.133
It's a magic key, Freya.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.400
If we don't find it,

10:10.433 --> 10:11.933
we're stuck here.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.900
(grunting, bones cracking)

10:28.000 --> 10:30.833
Perfect.

10:30.866 --> 10:34.033
You're just my size.

10:43.306 --> 10:44.639
Killian?

10:44.673 --> 10:46.139
It's Ingrid.

10:46.173 --> 10:48.673

Libero Sigillum.
Libero Sigillum.

11:08.973 --> 11:10.473
available at the moment.

11:11.706 --> 11:14.473
Open up.

11:19.306 --> 11:21.273
Oh, what is that?

11:21.306 --> 11:23.273
This is lotus root.

11:23.306 --> 11:26.106
I think it's what Freya was
trying to give you in the dream.

11:26.139 --> 11:28.673
It's a folk remedy
used to draw out

11:28.706 --> 11:30.706
toxic substances from the body.

11:30.739 --> 11:33.139
It's a not cure and I'm
not great with potions‐‐

11:33.173 --> 11:34.373
that's more Freya's specialty‐‐

11:34.406 --> 11:36.273
but it might
slow down the progress

11:36.306 --> 11:37.673
of whatever you took.

11:37.706 --> 11:39.173
"Slow down."

11:39.206 --> 11:41.606
Not stop.

11:41.639 --> 11:43.506
So, I'm still dying?

11:43.539 --> 11:46.173
Killian, I'm so sorry.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.773
Let's‐let's get you up
and walking.

11:48.806 --> 11:51.173
See? You're strong.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.706
Yeah.
Look at that.

11:52.739 --> 11:53.839
Okay.

11:53.873 --> 11:55.773
You got this.

be stuck here forever!

12:02.473 --> 12:04.506
Well, technically we
won't get to forever.

12:04.539 --> 12:06.106
Because if we don't
find the key,

12:06.139 --> 12:08.106
then we're gonna be dead
within a few hours.

12:08.139 --> 12:09.839
Because we don't belong here!

12:10.639 --> 12:12.339
Okay, okay.

12:12.373 --> 12:14.739
Okay.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.506

12:22.539 --> 12:25.106
I'm focusing in
on the key's energy.

12:25.139 --> 12:27.139
Come on, carmine clavem.

12:27.173 --> 12:30.006
(Wendy claps her hands)

12:30.039 --> 12:31.473
I don't think it's here.

12:31.506 --> 12:33.706
Wait! Wait!
Maybe we don't need a key!

12:33.739 --> 12:35.339
I can pick locks.
I went through

12:35.373 --> 12:36.473
this delinquent phase
when I was 15...

12:36.506 --> 12:37.839
What don't you understand

12:37.873 --> 12:39.939
about the concept
of a magic key, Freya?

12:39.973 --> 12:41.806
The spell won't work without it!

12:41.839 --> 12:43.606
What are we gonna do?
Okay.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.006
Okay, we're gonna calm down.

12:45.039 --> 12:46.506
We're gonna just
retrace our steps.

12:46.539 --> 12:47.839
Okay, but we have to hurry

12:47.873 --> 12:49.973
because we're
running out of time!

12:50.006 --> 12:52.473
(horse neighs)

13:13.306 --> 13:16.373
(indistinct chatter)

13:30.806 --> 13:33.306
(gasps)
Penny for my wine, ma'am?

13:33.339 --> 13:35.273
I'm sorry. I can't.

13:35.306 --> 13:36.973
Anything would help.

13:37.006 --> 13:38.939
I tell you what‐‐
if you go to the Cat & Shadow,

13:38.973 --> 13:40.773
and speak to whoever's
behind the bar,

13:40.806 --> 13:42.473
tell them Joanna Beauchamp
says you can have

13:42.506 --> 13:43.773
a glass of whatever you want.

13:43.806 --> 13:46.373
God bless you, Mrs. Beauchamp!

13:55.139 --> 13:57.339
You know what, Killian,
why don't we call Dash?

13:57.373 --> 13:59.306
Because I'm sure
he would be able to help...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.773
No! No, I'm done with him.

14:01.806 --> 14:04.439
Why? What happened?

14:04.473 --> 14:06.339
There are some things
between us

14:06.373 --> 14:07.939
that are never
gonna be resolved.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.006
Okay, Killian.

14:09.039 --> 14:10.306
I'm really sorry to do this,

14:10.339 --> 14:11.773
but there's something
I have to do.

14:11.806 --> 14:13.106
I want you to take
three drops of this

14:13.139 --> 14:15.206
every 15 minutes,
and I will be

14:15.239 --> 14:17.806
back here as soon as I can.

14:18.739 --> 14:19.939
Thank you, Ingrid.

14:19.973 --> 14:21.539
Just hold on a
little bit longer.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.006
We're gonna get through this.

14:23.039 --> 14:25.573
I promise.

14:50.873 --> 14:52.239
Tommy?

14:53.173 --> 14:54.773
(laughs)

14:54.806 --> 14:57.773
It has been a long time.

14:57.806 --> 14:59.873
Bastian.

14:59.906 --> 15:01.839
"Bastian"?

15:01.873 --> 15:03.139
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:03.173 --> 15:05.839
How did you get in here?
Magic.

15:08.006 --> 15:09.339
Hey, you know what?
I think it's time to leave.

15:09.373 --> 15:11.706
Vinculum!

15:15.639 --> 15:17.139
(grunts)

15:20.206 --> 15:22.173
You're not Tommy.

15:22.206 --> 15:24.173
Alas...

15:24.206 --> 15:26.939
Tommy is no more.

15:26.973 --> 15:29.339
I'm just wearing his skin.

15:29.373 --> 15:31.306
Then who are you?

15:31.339 --> 15:34.273
Someone who could kill you

15:34.306 --> 15:37.139
without a second thought.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.173
You're Ingrid's grandfather.

15:43.206 --> 15:44.506
King Nikolaus.

15:44.539 --> 15:45.539
Very good.

15:45.573 --> 15:47.639
Now... I understand

15:47.673 --> 15:50.439
you've been spending a lot
of time with my granddaughter.

15:50.473 --> 15:52.473
That is going to stop.

15:52.506 --> 15:54.806
You see, I have big
plans for my family.

15:54.839 --> 15:57.473
So you're going to
stay out of my way.

15:57.506 --> 15:58.939
And you're going to
stay away from Ingrid.

15:58.973 --> 15:59.939
Go to hell!

15:59.973 --> 16:01.106
Bravo!

16:01.139 --> 16:02.373
There's the fire!

16:02.406 --> 16:03.973
That's what I like!

16:04.006 --> 16:06.006
There's a war
happening inside you.

16:06.039 --> 16:08.973
Isn't there?
Darkness versus light.

16:09.006 --> 16:11.939
Which one will win?

16:11.973 --> 16:13.606
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.506
Oh, you tasted blood!

16:16.539 --> 16:17.973
Not just once.

16:18.006 --> 16:20.673
And you enjoyed it.

16:20.706 --> 16:23.639
That's the Bastian I knew.

16:23.673 --> 16:25.606
Capable

16:25.639 --> 16:26.673
of betraying a lover.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.673
Or destroying a brother.

16:28.706 --> 16:30.506
Whatever it took

16:30.539 --> 16:33.139
to get what he wants.

16:33.173 --> 16:36.206
That's what I
admired about you.

16:37.639 --> 16:41.606
You were exceptionally loyal.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.439
And because of that,

16:44.473 --> 16:46.439
you were rewarded many riches

16:46.473 --> 16:48.606
and powers

16:48.639 --> 16:51.439
beyond your wildest dreams.

16:51.473 --> 16:54.339
Remain loyal now,

16:54.373 --> 16:58.006
you will be rewarded again.

17:17.173 --> 17:18.506
If you're thinking
of buying it,

17:18.539 --> 17:20.806
it's out of your
price range.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.473
Have you ever been there?

17:22.506 --> 17:23.839
Fair Haven?

17:23.873 --> 17:25.139
God, no.

17:25.173 --> 17:26.806
I never get invited
to the good parties.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.706
The good orgies either
for that matter.

17:29.739 --> 17:31.039
"Orgies"?

17:31.073 --> 17:34.173
Sure. Orgies and devil worship

17:34.206 --> 17:35.639
and God knows what.

17:35.673 --> 17:37.106
The guy that built
that place

17:37.139 --> 17:39.306
was into some very weird shit.

17:40.306 --> 17:42.406
Very weird shit, huh?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.339
Hey. It's me.

17:55.739 --> 17:58.406
I think I might really be
onto something here.

18:07.196 --> 18:09.096
(door closes,
footsteps approach)

18:09.783 --> 18:10.649
Okay, Dash.

18:10.682 --> 18:12.649
I know exactly
what we have to do.

18:12.682 --> 18:15.616
And I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

18:15.649 --> 18:17.149
Did something happen in here?

18:17.182 --> 18:19.582
Your grandfather
just paid me a visit.

18:19.616 --> 18:22.316
Oh, no.

18:22.349 --> 18:24.816
He must know
I've been coming here.

18:24.849 --> 18:26.116
I don't think so.

18:26.149 --> 18:27.782
Of course he knows.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.116
Shit, Dash, this is bad!

18:29.149 --> 18:30.616
I don't think
that's why he came.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.149
He said he knew me.

18:32.182 --> 18:34.516
From another life, back
in Asgard or something.

18:34.549 --> 18:36.416
Really?
He's got plans

18:36.449 --> 18:38.116
for your family, and he
promised to reward me

18:38.149 --> 18:39.516
if I didn't get involved.

18:39.549 --> 18:42.449
Dash, you know
he's lying, right?

18:44.116 --> 18:45.482
Look, Ingrid,

18:45.516 --> 18:47.316
I'm on your side.

18:47.349 --> 18:49.149
All right? That son of a
bitch threatened to kill me.

18:49.182 --> 18:51.116
So if there's a way to stop him,
let's not just stand here

18:51.149 --> 18:52.616
talking about it. Let's do it.
Okay.

18:52.649 --> 18:54.082
There is a way.

18:54.116 --> 18:57.416
We need to bring back
the journals we burned.

18:57.449 --> 18:58.816
What?!

18:58.849 --> 18:59.982
You said those spells
were so dark,

19:00.016 --> 19:01.616
they'd mess with our souls.

19:01.649 --> 19:02.949
Well, we need a dark spell

19:02.982 --> 19:05.116
to stop a dark warlock.

19:05.149 --> 19:08.449
Okay, but these journals look
pretty incinerated to me.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.149
I mean, what are we gonna do‐‐
glue them back together

19:10.182 --> 19:12.449
piece by piece?
No, we're gonna use magic.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.249
We can reconstitute them.

19:14.282 --> 19:16.416
My mother burned
our Grimoire once.

19:16.449 --> 19:18.949
So, I know we can do this.

19:22.849 --> 19:25.649
WOMEN:
♪ Sowing in the morning ♪

19:25.682 --> 19:27.416
♪ Sowing seeds ♪

19:27.449 --> 19:29.316
♪ Of kindness ♪

19:29.349 --> 19:32.082
♪ Sowing in the noontide ♪

19:32.116 --> 19:34.949
♪ And the dewy eve ♪

19:34.982 --> 19:38.116
♪ Waiting for the harvest ♪

19:38.149 --> 19:40.282
♪ And the time of reaping ♪

19:40.316 --> 19:44.282
♪ We shall come rejoicing ♪

19:44.316 --> 19:47.649
♪ Bringing in the sheaves. ♪

19:49.549 --> 19:51.349
Maybe I dropped the key
in the dressing room.

19:51.382 --> 19:52.949
Oh, you better have!
I can feel myself

19:52.982 --> 19:54.849
starting to unexist
by the second!

19:54.882 --> 19:56.649
Oh, Freya, it's not
gonna work like that!

19:56.682 --> 19:58.182
You're not gonna unexist.

19:58.216 --> 20:00.116
First you'll start
to feel really sick.

20:00.149 --> 20:02.949
And then your organs
will start to liquefy basically.

20:02.982 --> 20:04.182
And you'll start to bleed out!

20:04.216 --> 20:06.116
I can feel it! My liver.

20:06.149 --> 20:07.682
It's already
starting to liquefy.

20:07.716 --> 20:08.982
Oh, don't be a drama queen.

20:09.016 --> 20:10.249
It's gonna not happen yet!

20:10.282 --> 20:11.849
Not till the time
door disappears.

20:11.882 --> 20:13.282
What?
The time door disappears?!

20:13.316 --> 20:15.516
Yeah, and then after
12 hours, we disappear.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.816
Oh, my God.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.916
Freya?

20:18.949 --> 20:20.149
Killian.

20:20.182 --> 20:21.816
Who's Killian?
Uh...

20:21.849 --> 20:23.416
Freya, that's Edgar.

20:23.449 --> 20:25.449
I can't believe it's really you.

20:25.482 --> 20:26.782
Are you okay, my love?

20:26.816 --> 20:28.749
I told you she wasn't well.

20:28.782 --> 20:30.249
He looks exactly like...

20:30.282 --> 20:31.782
Who?
Killian!

20:31.816 --> 20:33.182
No, he doesn't.
Who is Killian?
Yes, he does.

20:33.216 --> 20:34.349
He looks exactly
like Edgar Allen Poe.

20:34.382 --> 20:35.516
I am Edgar Allen Poe.

20:35.549 --> 20:37.649
How am I the only one
seeing this?

20:37.682 --> 20:39.616
Freya, I've been sick
with worry about you.

20:41.982 --> 20:43.282
I'm fine.

20:43.316 --> 20:45.482
WENDY: She's fine.
We got to go!

20:45.516 --> 20:47.316
Find something.
In the dressing room!

20:47.349 --> 20:49.949
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.

21:04.682 --> 21:07.416
Oh, Freya...

21:07.449 --> 21:09.449
My sweet Freya.

21:09.482 --> 21:11.749
My sweet Freya.

21:11.782 --> 21:14.449
I'm so sorry.

21:16.516 --> 21:18.949
Please
forgive me.

21:18.982 --> 21:20.349
(crying quietly)

21:22.316 --> 21:24.049
I love you.

21:31.982 --> 21:34.749
My God.

21:34.782 --> 21:37.516
Is it a shifter?

21:39.682 --> 21:42.482
No, hon.

21:42.516 --> 21:44.282
It's me.

21:50.649 --> 21:53.449
I need the
Anima Aucupe.

22:00.982 --> 22:02.449
Thank you.

22:17.116 --> 22:18.749
Hello, Joanna.

22:18.782 --> 22:20.616
What the hell
are you doing here,

22:20.649 --> 22:22.982
you son of a bitch?

22:28.016 --> 22:29.416
Your father
sent me.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.916
With strict orders to kill you.

22:31.949 --> 22:32.982
Get out of my way.

22:33.016 --> 22:34.449
Not until I get what I want.

22:34.482 --> 22:36.282
Aperi.

22:38.116 --> 22:39.882
Sorry, Joanna.

22:49.016 --> 22:51.182
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

22:51.216 --> 22:53.749
Okay, I don't
understand.

22:53.782 --> 22:55.282
He looked exactly
like Killian.

22:55.316 --> 22:57.082
I'm sorry, honey,
I just don't see it.

22:57.116 --> 22:58.516
But how do you not see it?

22:58.549 --> 22:59.749
He's the spitting image...

22:59.782 --> 23:01.282
Of Edgar Allen Poe.

23:01.316 --> 23:02.949
Ah, I'm starting
to lose my mind.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.749
Oh, I bet I know

23:05.782 --> 23:06.949
what it is.
What?

23:06.982 --> 23:07.949
You can recognize his soul.

23:07.982 --> 23:10.116
That's a thing?
Sure.

23:10.149 --> 23:12.682
You said it yourself:
you did that spell to remember

23:12.716 --> 23:14.949
your past lives, and in every
life, you come across Killian

23:14.982 --> 23:16.182
and you fall in love.

23:16.216 --> 23:18.149
That's obviously
one of your gifts.

23:18.182 --> 23:19.616
You can recognize his soul

23:19.649 --> 23:21.249
even when it's
in another incarnation.

23:21.282 --> 23:22.649
Oh.

23:22.682 --> 23:24.349
That actually makes sense.

23:24.382 --> 23:26.516
In a bizarre sort of way.

23:26.549 --> 23:28.016
Honey, bizarre is where we live.

23:28.049 --> 23:30.116
WENDY:
Yes, I know.
I'll be right down.

23:30.149 --> 23:31.516
Oh, my God,
hide.

23:33.549 --> 23:36.149
Just wait for me at the bar.

23:48.482 --> 23:50.182
(very quietly):
Ah, the key.

23:51.516 --> 23:53.016
(gasps)

24:16.816 --> 24:19.149
Oh, no.

24:23.682 --> 24:25.949
How did you
not know

24:25.982 --> 24:27.616
that you had the key
this whole time?

24:27.649 --> 24:28.982
Oh, I'm sorry,
Freya.

24:29.016 --> 24:30.616
After you killed me,
I guess that wasn't

24:30.649 --> 24:33.282
the biggest thing
to happen to me that day.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.116
There's a spell
to switch bodies

24:40.149 --> 24:41.782
with another
witch.

24:41.816 --> 24:44.616
There's one to control
the mind of a human

24:44.649 --> 24:46.982
that ends in
the human's demise.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.582
Okay, does anything
sound powerful enough

24:48.616 --> 24:50.916
to stop your
grandfather?
No, not yet.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.916
I need to take these home.
I can study them.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.416
I don't think
that's a good idea.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.782
Why not?

24:55.816 --> 24:57.582
What if your
grandfather finds them?

24:57.616 --> 24:59.082
I mean, if he's
already suspicious,

24:59.116 --> 25:00.416
that would be bad.
Just leave them.

25:00.449 --> 25:01.616
Dash, no.

25:01.649 --> 25:03.082
I won't turn
into a demon.

25:03.116 --> 25:05.316
I swear.

25:05.349 --> 25:07.149
I won't even
open them.

25:07.182 --> 25:08.616
I trust you, but I don't know

25:08.649 --> 25:10.316
if I trust these books.

25:10.349 --> 25:11.916
Ingrid, I won't
even read them

25:11.949 --> 25:13.816

get back.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.982
Okay.
I really should get home.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.082
I will be back
as soon as I can.

25:20.116 --> 25:21.949
Okay, I'll
be waiting.

25:41.449 --> 25:43.849
You're falling asleep,
aren't you?

25:43.882 --> 25:45.649
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:45.682 --> 25:47.649
I'm out of my mind,
I'm so tired.

25:47.682 --> 25:49.816
I know, but you heard
what Ingrid said.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.749
You just need to hold on
a little longer

25:51.782 --> 25:52.982

25:53.016 --> 25:55.016
I know. I know.

25:56.216 --> 25:57.816
Stay alive!

25:57.849 --> 25:59.082
I am!

25:59.116 --> 26:00.849
Killian, please!

26:00.882 --> 26:02.416
Killian!
Freya!

26:02.449 --> 26:04.716

26:58.038 --> 27:00.605
Oh, thank you.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.722
How we gonna get
the key from her?

27:05.755 --> 27:07.055
She's you.

27:07.088 --> 27:08.422
I thought maybe you
would have some ideas.

27:08.455 --> 27:10.022
WENDY:
Ah, it's so tricky.

27:10.055 --> 27:11.722
You can't change
anything from the past,

27:11.755 --> 27:13.588

you want to.
FREYA: I know.
What has happened

27:13.622 --> 27:15.388
has already happened,
will always happen,
blah, blah, blah.

27:15.422 --> 27:16.888
The thing is,

27:16.922 --> 27:19.188
is I never remember
taking the key from myself,

27:19.222 --> 27:20.588
so obviously
I didn't do it,

27:20.622 --> 27:22.722
and I never saw you
again in this life,

27:22.755 --> 27:25.188
because you were already
dead, so you didn't get
it from me, either.

27:25.222 --> 27:26.888
What happens if neither
one of us gets the key?

27:26.922 --> 27:28.055
What if we never
get the key?

27:28.088 --> 27:29.355
All right, all right,
calm down.

27:29.388 --> 27:31.055
We'll think
of something.

27:31.088 --> 27:32.555
There's a few more minutes
before your mom gets here.

27:32.588 --> 27:34.688
I have been looking
for you guys everywhere.

27:34.722 --> 27:36.555
Joanna...
Mom...
What are you doing here?

27:36.588 --> 27:38.922
I told you to meet me
at the time door.
Well,

27:38.955 --> 27:41.888
the thing is...
We came inside because it
looked like it was gonna rain.

27:41.922 --> 27:43.022
There's been
a complication.

27:43.055 --> 27:44.588
What?
I lost the

27:44.622 --> 27:47.022
Anima Aucupe.
What?
How?

27:47.055 --> 27:48.922
Well, the minute I got it back
from myself, Tarkoff took it.

27:48.955 --> 27:49.855
Wait, Tarkoff?

27:49.888 --> 27:51.522
He's here?
Yes.

27:51.555 --> 27:53.855
And he vanished before
I could get it back from him.

27:53.888 --> 27:56.088
Okay, we‐we... we have
a complication of our own

27:56.122 --> 27:57.355
and you're gonna be

27:57.388 --> 27:59.755
really, really
mad.
There he is.

28:06.222 --> 28:07.888
JOANNA:
All right, go to the time door

28:07.922 --> 28:10.355
and I will meet you there
in ten minutes.
Wait, Mom...

28:10.388 --> 28:12.188
I am gonna finish this
once and for all.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.455
No, wait...
Mom, Mom!

28:13.488 --> 28:14.922
Oh...

28:31.288 --> 28:33.955
I'm happy
to see you.

28:33.988 --> 28:36.188
Maybe now we can have
a civilized conversation.

28:36.222 --> 28:37.688
I'm not here
to talk.

28:37.722 --> 28:38.922
Ah!

28:38.955 --> 28:41.122
Careful.

28:41.155 --> 28:43.188
This is a fragile piece
of workmanship.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.488
You wouldn't want
to damage it.

28:49.255 --> 28:51.888
You're never
gonna win this.

28:51.922 --> 28:53.388
Not without me.

28:54.788 --> 28:55.955
What are you suggesting?

28:55.988 --> 28:58.255
Let's kill him.
Together.

28:58.288 --> 29:00.255
(laughing):
You're not making sense.

29:00.288 --> 29:01.755
We defeat the king.

29:01.788 --> 29:04.755
He won't stand a chance
against the both of us.

29:04.788 --> 29:07.022
And then you and I

29:07.055 --> 29:10.555
go back to Asgard.

29:10.588 --> 29:12.755
Together.

29:14.222 --> 29:15.655
Is that what
you want?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.255
We can be
a team, Joanna.

29:19.288 --> 29:22.922
We can beat him.

29:22.955 --> 29:25.455
I'm offering you
your only chance.

29:27.455 --> 29:28.922
I'd rather die.

29:39.055 --> 29:41.288
Oh, Joanna.

29:42.955 --> 29:46.622
Why do you always have
to do things the hard way?

29:54.222 --> 29:56.222
(piano playing gentle melody)

29:58.058 --> 30:00.458
Whatever happened
to Poe, anyway?

30:00.492 --> 30:01.792
He died shortly
after you did.

30:01.825 --> 30:03.325
Drank himself
to death.

30:03.358 --> 30:04.525
That's awful.

30:04.558 --> 30:06.025
I know.

30:06.058 --> 30:07.358
He loved you.

30:07.392 --> 30:09.825
Your death
broke his heart.

30:09.858 --> 30:11.158
I should go
talk to him.

30:11.192 --> 30:13.458
Say something,
make him feel better.

30:13.492 --> 30:14.692
Wait, come here.
No.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.692
You can't.
Why?

30:16.725 --> 30:18.658
Because it wouldn't
change anything.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.292
He died over
160 years ago.

30:21.325 --> 30:23.058
It's already
happened, remember?

30:23.092 --> 30:25.625
We can't change the past even
when we're standing in it.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.958
But that is
Killian.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.458
Or his soul,
anyway.

30:28.492 --> 30:29.792
I don't want him
to suffer and die

30:29.825 --> 30:31.125
because of me.

30:31.158 --> 30:32.525
I know, honey.

30:32.558 --> 30:33.825
It's tragic.

30:33.858 --> 30:37.192
(sighs)
But it's done.

30:37.225 --> 30:38.625
(gasps)

30:38.658 --> 30:40.025
What?
Oh, my God.

30:40.058 --> 30:41.358
I just remembered.

30:41.392 --> 30:44.458
Poe hit on me
the night that you died.
Huh?

30:44.492 --> 30:46.025
Oh, I didn't
understand why, then,

30:46.058 --> 30:47.625
but now I get it.

30:47.658 --> 30:48.992
Yeah, I'm not
following.

30:49.025 --> 30:52.058
Okay, this is what
you need to do.

30:54.992 --> 30:56.192
May I?

30:56.225 --> 30:58.525
Of course.

30:58.558 --> 31:00.025
You look...

31:00.058 --> 31:01.358
Different.

31:01.392 --> 31:02.992
Exactly.

31:04.392 --> 31:06.525
You've been saved,
haven't you?

31:06.558 --> 31:08.525
They drove the spirit
of Ambrose out of you.

31:08.558 --> 31:10.458
I knew they could do it.

31:10.492 --> 31:12.392
No, not exactly.

31:12.425 --> 31:14.525
I'm not the same Freya you knew.

31:14.558 --> 31:16.792
I'm a... newer model.

31:16.825 --> 31:19.792
I'm afraid I don't follow.

31:19.825 --> 31:22.725
But, then again,
knowing your family,

31:22.758 --> 31:24.358
there's very little that
can surprise me anymore.

31:24.392 --> 31:27.892
FREYA:
I know I look like
your Freya, but I'm not.

31:27.925 --> 31:30.325
Just like you look like
someone else, to me,

31:30.358 --> 31:31.725
but you're not him, either.

31:31.758 --> 31:34.725
Killian.

31:34.758 --> 31:35.992
That's what you kept calling me.

31:36.025 --> 31:38.492
And you love him?

31:38.525 --> 31:40.658
I do, but he's really
far away right now.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.525
I'm sorry.

31:42.558 --> 31:43.892
That's okay.

31:43.925 --> 31:46.525
Because I'm here
with you right now.

31:46.558 --> 31:48.325
And I need your help.

31:48.358 --> 31:50.158
(knocking)

31:55.892 --> 31:58.858
These late night visits
are becoming a habit.

31:58.892 --> 32:01.558
Actually this visit is
business, not pleasure.

32:01.592 --> 32:03.125
Okay.

32:03.158 --> 32:04.658
Come on in.

32:09.225 --> 32:11.825
Hell of a place.

32:11.858 --> 32:14.525
Know anything about the man
that built it?

32:14.558 --> 32:15.858
Of course.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.225
Can I get you a drink?

32:20.725 --> 32:23.192
His name was
Archibald Browning.

32:23.225 --> 32:26.658
Wealthy industrialist
around the turn of the century.

32:26.692 --> 32:28.692
He was actually
a distant relative.

32:28.725 --> 32:31.158
Did you know that Fair
Haven is rumored to be

32:31.192 --> 32:33.992
a gathering place for witches?

32:34.025 --> 32:35.458
News to me.

32:35.492 --> 32:37.492
Hmm.

32:37.525 --> 32:41.192
Story goes Browning
was a warlock.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.158
And he built this place

32:43.192 --> 32:45.825
so he could practice
occult ceremonies.

32:45.858 --> 32:48.992
Occult ceremonies?

32:49.025 --> 32:50.692
Blood rites.

32:50.725 --> 32:53.692
Animal sacrifices.

32:53.725 --> 32:56.858
Devil worship.

32:58.325 --> 33:00.658
I mean, if these
walls could talk.

33:00.692 --> 33:02.558
Right?

33:02.592 --> 33:04.658
Too bad they can't.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.492
You know all
the information
I just gave you

33:06.525 --> 33:08.192
is public record?

33:08.225 --> 33:11.192
A lot of people in
town know about it.

33:11.225 --> 33:13.025
It's part of local culture.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.025
And yet you claim to not know

33:16.058 --> 33:18.458
word one.

33:18.492 --> 33:20.158
So what are you saying?

33:20.192 --> 33:22.292
I think

33:22.325 --> 33:24.525
whoever committed these murders,

33:24.558 --> 33:28.158
was into the same sorts of stuff
as Archibald Browning was.

33:28.192 --> 33:31.292
I mean, he carved symbols

33:31.325 --> 33:32.992
into the bodies of his victims.

33:33.025 --> 33:33.992
Oh, I know.

33:34.025 --> 33:35.792
I saw them.

33:35.825 --> 33:38.292
I watched them die.

33:38.325 --> 33:42.025
East End is turning out
to be a very strange place

33:42.058 --> 33:44.558
with a very strange history.

33:44.592 --> 33:47.458
And you just happen
to be living

33:47.492 --> 33:50.525
right in the exact
center of it all.

33:54.225 --> 33:57.825
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me?

34:02.558 --> 34:06.125
Actually there is.

34:06.158 --> 34:07.858
What?

34:07.892 --> 34:10.225
Go...

34:10.258 --> 34:12.525
