WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:02.040
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:02.040 --> 00:04.080
- I would be thrilled
if you'd consider

00:04.080 --> 00:05.620
having me produce your album.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.000
There are some
incredible musicians

00:07.000 --> 00:08.580
we could bring in for it.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.330
- You want me to fire my band?
He needs me.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.750
- I get that. I don't understand
why you need him.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.170
- You can't post that.

00:14.170 --> 00:15.500
- It's just a joke.
- Okay, fine.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.460
- Just a bunch of people online

00:17.460 --> 00:19.120
saying really mean things
about your sister.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.460
- I want to know
what you think

00:20.460 --> 00:21.500
about finding
another job for him.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.170
- You're wanna let him go.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.920
- I'm pregnant,
and you're the father.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.250
- You're the best person
I've ever know.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.790
Please just say
you'll try with me.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.210
- You ever think about
just keeping on driving,

00:39.210 --> 00:40.420
and leaving all this behind you?

00:40.420 --> 00:42.040
- (chuckles)

00:43.420 --> 00:44.580
- Yeah. I tried to.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.670
You talked me out of it,
remember?

00:46.670 --> 00:48.170
- I mean, together.

00:48.170 --> 00:51.460
Sedona, Seattle, Portland,
I don't know.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.420
Just...just a simple life.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.080
- Simple life.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.120
- No more tours, no cameras.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.670
Just you and me
and number three.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.000
-And now from Hollywood
to Nashville

01:05.000 --> 01:07.500
where the online
ship communities are buzzing

01:07.500 --> 01:09.120
over these new photos
of country stars,

01:09.120 --> 01:11.420
Scarlett O'Connor
and Gunnar Scott.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.040
An exclusive photo
obtained by Access Hollywood

01:14.040 --> 01:17.620
reveals what looks
to be a baby bump.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.710
For the on-again,
off-again couple,

01:19.710 --> 01:21.920
this would be the first child
for either of them.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.420
Their latest single,
"All of Me",

01:24.420 --> 01:26.170
is lighting up the charts.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.500
Those are the latest headlines
from Access Hollywood.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.120
- Bucky! So good to see you.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.380
- Ah! Mmm...

01:35.380 --> 01:38.210
This is the most excited
I've been in 10 years.

01:38.210 --> 01:41.000
I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you so much.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.330
- Lauren, hey!
- Hey!

01:43.330 --> 01:45.040
- You know Maddie Jaymes, right?
- Yeah, girl,

01:45.040 --> 01:47.210
you are so talented.
- Thank you.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.670
- Don't listen to a word
this guy says.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.120
- Hey, I'm gonna send you
her single.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.170
It's pretty unbelievable.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.920
- I've already got it on repeat.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.670
- You will not believe
the emails I'm getting.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.920
They want you for gigs in L.A.,
Seattle, Brooklyn.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.620
We got to get a tour
set up for you.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.080
- It just means the world to me

02:02.080 --> 02:03.960
that you're willing to do this.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.040
- Maddie, it was
the honor of my life

02:06.040 --> 02:07.250
to work with your mom.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.620
And nothing could
make me happier

02:09.620 --> 02:13.290
than to be here with you
managing your career.

02:13.290 --> 02:16.120
- My dad was sick
after what Zach did.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.420
- Well, change happens,
you know.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.080
Gotta roll with it.
- Yeah.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.290
- Speaking of which,

02:23.290 --> 02:24.920
you are sure that
Juliette's okay with this?

02:24.920 --> 02:28.210
- Oh, yeah.
She is already on to new crises.

02:29.790 --> 02:34.210
♪ I'm goin' down
that road feeling bad ♪

02:34.210 --> 02:37.790
♪ Goin' down that road
feeling bad ♪

02:37.790 --> 02:41.540
♪ Goin' down that road
feeling bad, Lord, Lord ♪

02:41.540 --> 02:45.420
♪ Ain't gonna be
treated this way ♪

02:59.920 --> 03:03.750
♪ They feed me on cornbread

03:03.750 --> 03:07.880
♪ They feed me on

03:07.880 --> 03:11.380
♪ Feed me on cornbread,

03:11.380 --> 03:14.120
♪ I ain't gonna be

03:19.290 --> 03:21.380
- Woo!
That was awesome.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.290
- You know what else is awesome?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.420
Having a meeting with the label
in a few hours.

03:25.420 --> 03:27.080
And having no demo to play.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.170
We definitely never
agreed on that song.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.790
And it'll never be played
on the radio.

03:30.790 --> 03:33.290
Are we learning from
my mistakes here, or...

03:33.290 --> 03:34.620
- Of course, we were just...

03:34.620 --> 03:35.960
- I thought we agreed
on "Who I Love"?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.620
- We did agree, which is why...
- Yes!

03:37.620 --> 03:38.960
- Then why don't you
finish recording that?

03:38.960 --> 03:42.710
- Because we finished it
an hour ago.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.750
- Excuse me.
How was I supposed to know?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.460
- Maybe try letting someone
finish a sentence?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.000
- Hallie?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.830
Hallie, hey, wait!
What's going on?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.170
Listen, if this
isn't what you want

04:04.170 --> 04:05.830
or if it doesn't feel right,
just say so.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.000
- No, it's not that.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.210
- Then what is it?
What's going on?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.040
- It's George.
He ended it last night.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.750
He's gone.
- I'm so sorry.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.790
- He said there's no room
for him in my new life.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.500
How perfect,
coming from someone

04:23.500 --> 04:26.500
who still lives
with this wife.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.540
So many changes and
they're good ones, you know.

04:30.540 --> 04:34.250
But to be alone too,
it's just a little confusing.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.170
- I get it.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.750
I have actually been there.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.000
- And I don't know about
this song, you know.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.080
It just doesn't
feel like it's mine.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.830
You know what I mean?
- Yes...

04:48.830 --> 04:50.790
You're telling me you want
to do a different one?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.080
- I can't go against Juliette
after all she's done for me.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.620
- Because "Who I Love"
is a great song.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.380
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.330
I'm being whiny and ridiculous.
- No, no, not at all.

04:59.330 --> 05:03.210
You're not alone.
I'm here for you.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.500
Juliette is here for you,

05:06.500 --> 05:07.880
like you were for her.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.500
So whatever it is you need,

05:09.500 --> 05:12.330
just let us
help you with it, okay?

05:12.330 --> 05:14.120
- Thank you.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.960
- Any time.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.830
- You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

05:26.830 --> 05:28.380
It's not like you
made any of them.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.790
- My God!
Liv, they're horrible!

05:29.790 --> 05:31.670
Daph, you gotta see this!
My EP is up!

05:31.670 --> 05:32.920
And the graphics
are so cool

05:32.920 --> 05:34.330
- Wait!
- Stop! I want to show you.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.080
Hey...

05:38.080 --> 05:40.170
Why is this on here?

05:40.170 --> 05:41.380
- No reason.
- You were looking at this?

05:41.380 --> 05:43.040
- No. Maddie...
- Stop...

05:43.040 --> 05:44.380
- Maddie, that's my laptop.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.920
Okay? Give it back!

05:49.290 --> 05:51.120
- You made this.
- No!

05:51.120 --> 05:53.460
- Oh, my God!
- Maddie, it wasn't like that!

05:53.460 --> 05:55.170
- How could you do this?

05:55.170 --> 05:57.620
- It wasn't that hard, anyway.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.170
- I'm so sorry.
Please, I can explain.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.330
- Explain what, Daphne?
How you ruined my life?

06:01.330 --> 06:02.920
- She got millions of people
talking about...

06:02.920 --> 06:04.250
- Stay out of this!

06:04.250 --> 06:06.330
- Isn't that exactly
what you wanted?

06:06.330 --> 06:08.120
- I should have known
you were behind this.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.830
- No one was behind anything.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.620
- You need to chill out.
Everything's gonna be okay, God!

06:12.620 --> 06:14.460
- Get out of my house.
- Maddie, no.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.170
- This is my family
in my house!

06:16.170 --> 06:19.670
Get out! I swear to God,
Liv, if you don't

06:19.670 --> 06:20.750
get outta my house
in five seconds,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.420
I'm calling the cops.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.420
- Maddie, stop...
- One, two...

06:25.460 --> 06:26.880
- Fine!

06:26.880 --> 06:30.000
You bore me anyway!

06:33.000 --> 06:36.830
- Liv, wait!
Don't go!

06:36.830 --> 06:38.830
- I know where I'm not wanted!

06:38.830 --> 06:40.250
- She's just freaking out!
This'll blow over!

06:40.250 --> 06:42.380
- Come on, it's not just this.

06:42.380 --> 06:45.080
- What do you mean?
- I don't belong here.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.380
- You do to me.

06:47.380 --> 06:49.210
- You're sweet.
Have a nice life.

06:49.210 --> 06:50.790
- Liv...

06:52.960 --> 06:54.420
- I meant it, you know.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.670
- You meant what?

06:55.670 --> 06:58.960
- That you're my kind of girl.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.790
Thank you for caring.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.750
♪ I don't give a damn
about what you think ♪

07:27.750 --> 07:31.000
♪ You're never gonna
see the way I see ♪

07:31.000 --> 07:35.250
♪ Nobody gets
a say in who I love ♪

07:35.250 --> 07:39.330
♪ Nobody gets a say
in who I love ♪

07:39.330 --> 07:42.380
♪ Who I love
Who I love ♪

07:44.080 --> 07:46.420
- I would have killed
for a song like this.

07:46.420 --> 07:49.620
This is an anthem for every girl

07:49.620 --> 07:52.710
that was ever knocked down
and stood back up.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.920
Who was stronger and tougher
because of it.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.580
This is an amazing
moment for Hallie.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.670
You love it, right?

08:00.670 --> 08:02.500
- It's a mighty big song...

08:02.500 --> 08:05.420
- Yeah, it is,
and it's powerful.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.040
I know Hallie's
hesitant about it.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
But that's just because of fear.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.000
This is absolutely the direction
we need to go.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.960
The crossover potential
of this song is huge.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.000
- Slow down just a second.
I hear you, I do.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.420
But, Juliette, I'm just--

08:18.420 --> 08:20.210
I'm a little confused
by that sound.

08:20.210 --> 08:23.790
- You're confu--
W-what does that even mean?

08:23.790 --> 08:26.670
How are you confused?

08:26.670 --> 08:28.080
- Actually, I'd be
more comfortable

08:28.080 --> 08:29.670
if Hallie was here
to discuss this.

08:29.670 --> 08:32.500
- Well, Hallie was more
comfortable with having me

08:32.500 --> 08:35.210
handling the business
side of things, so...

08:35.210 --> 08:38.620
- All right, then.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.290
I think with this,

08:40.290 --> 08:42.080
we'll lose the authenticity
that makes her special.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.620
She's a roots performer.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.330
Right there, that could have
been sung by just about anybody.

08:47.330 --> 08:51.920
- Deacon, you cannot pigeonhole
her into doing one style.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.290
- I know that,
but I also didn't sign her

08:53.290 --> 08:54.670
to sign the next
pop princess, all right?

08:54.670 --> 08:56.620
I signed her because
the artist in her

08:56.620 --> 09:00.790
spoke to the artist in me.
Am I wrong here?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.000
- No. I definitely
know what you mean.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.830
This is way more commercial than
what Hallie wanted initially.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.040
But I think that Juliette
is just saying

09:09.040 --> 09:12.170
that she wants her to
succeed like we all do.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.920
- But isn't true success

09:13.920 --> 09:15.420
doing what you love?
Doing it well?

09:15.420 --> 09:16.620
Isn't that why Rayna
started this label?

09:16.620 --> 09:18.250
- Sometimes doing what you love

09:18.250 --> 09:21.540
leads to utter failure
if you're not careful.

09:21.540 --> 09:25.460
- Well, this isn't like what
happened to you, Juliette.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.250
- No. It's worse.
- How's it worse?

09:27.250 --> 09:28.710
- Because I was
an established artist

09:28.710 --> 09:31.710
who had the luxury
of taking a chance.

09:31.710 --> 09:33.210
Hallie does not!

09:33.210 --> 09:34.920
- Hey, wait a second...
- I'm sorry.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.290
Isn't this exactly what
we just did with Maddie?

09:37.290 --> 09:40.000
And forgive me if I'm wrong,
but I think it turned out

09:40.000 --> 09:42.170
pretty damn well,
thank you very much.

09:42.170 --> 09:44.750
- Juliette, this is not--
- We are not helping Hallie

09:44.750 --> 09:48.290
if we allow her to hide
in her comfort zone...

09:48.290 --> 09:50.120
- I'm not talking
about her hiding at all.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.790
- Rather than pushing her
to see what she is capable of!

09:52.790 --> 09:55.620
- All right, I hear you.
We all her you.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.750
Avery, you wanted to produce her

10:01.750 --> 10:03.580
because you heard in her
exactly what I heard.

10:03.580 --> 10:05.250
Are you really telling
me that this is how

10:05.250 --> 10:07.710
we want to introduce
her to the world?

10:07.710 --> 10:10.380
- Look, "Who I Love"
is a terrific song.

10:13.670 --> 10:16.620
But it's not
the right song for her.

10:16.620 --> 10:20.040
I mean, Hallie has
something unique...

10:23.710 --> 10:27.540
And she deserves to
share it with the world.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.830
If she fails on her
own merit, so be it.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.120
- That's the album
I want for Highway 65.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.290
- Congratulations!

10:39.290 --> 10:41.290
- Is it true?
- We're so excited for you!

10:41.290 --> 10:43.080
- When are you due?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.790
- Oh, I haven't really
figured that out yet.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.880
- You must be excited too.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.500
- Uh, yeah, I am.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.000
- You are our favorite couple.
Can I get a picture?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.920
Like in the front of the van.
Like together?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.080
- Hey, sweetheart.
What's up?

11:14.540 --> 11:17.170
What?

11:17.170 --> 11:18.750
- Daphne and Liv made the GIF.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.460
- The GIF--
You don't mean that...

11:21.460 --> 11:23.380
- Yep, that's exactly
what I mean.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.000
- No, she wouldn't do that.
She wouldn't even know how.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.960
- I found this on her computer.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.620
- It's just a stupid GIF!
I'm so sorry!

11:39.620 --> 11:41.250
I did not know it would
blow up like this!

11:41.250 --> 11:42.580
- What were you thinking,
Daphne?

11:42.580 --> 11:44.460
- I wasn't thinking anything!

11:44.460 --> 11:46.210
- You weren't thinking about how
this was gonna hurt your sister?

11:46.210 --> 11:47.250
You weren't thinking
about that at all?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.830
- Maddie...

11:48.830 --> 11:52.330
Maddie, I'm so sorry!

11:52.330 --> 11:55.250
I told her I feel so horrible
about this whole situation.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.960
- What do you think
we should do about it?

11:56.960 --> 11:59.210
- What do you mean?
I already apologized.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.670
- Do you think that makes up

12:00.670 --> 12:02.170
for me seeing this damn
thing everywhere I go?

12:02.170 --> 12:04.460
- Hey, all right.
Take it easy.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.710
In this case, I do not think
an apology is enough.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.000
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.420
The problem is, you're not
serious enough right here.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.460
I think I'm gonna
take your cell phone.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.670
One month,
no cell phone privileges.

12:15.670 --> 12:17.080
- What?
- That's it?

12:17.080 --> 12:19.330
Dad, she ruined my life?
- No phone for a month?

12:19.330 --> 12:21.750
- That's what it is, all right?
No phone, one month!

12:21.750 --> 12:23.960
That's what it's gotta be!

12:26.040 --> 12:27.500
What?

12:27.500 --> 12:29.670
- You can't take my phone
for a month!

12:29.670 --> 12:31.750
- Daphne, hey...
- What if there's an emergency?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.290
- Sweetie, I got along
half my life

12:33.290 --> 12:35.920
without one of these things,
all right?

12:35.920 --> 12:39.210
Daphne, I'm sorry.
That's what's got to be.

12:39.210 --> 12:43.040
Trying to do my best
here by both of you.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.920
No phone, one month.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.330
Would you please hand
your sister the syrup?

13:01.330 --> 13:02.710
- Uh, I'm not hungry.

13:02.710 --> 13:05.880
(cell phone rings)
- Hello?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.830
Yes, I know.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.540
They go live at 2:35, and
I'll be there at 2:00, thanks.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.790
- How many interviews is that?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.710
- Three.
- That's fantastic.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.670
- Why? They're just gonna ask me
about the stupid police video.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.330
Not even about my EP.
(cell phone rings)

13:19.330 --> 13:23.000
- Hey. This is she...

13:23.000 --> 13:24.540
Okay, thanks. Bye.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.750
Four...

13:26.750 --> 13:29.250
- See? You got something good
going on right now.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.290
You need to grab hold of it.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.120
- I will. Don't worry.

13:32.120 --> 13:36.000
(cell phone rings)

13:40.210 --> 13:42.080
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.880
I am.

13:46.380 --> 13:49.210
- Are you gonna give in?

13:49.210 --> 13:52.120
- Would you please have
a little compassion?

13:52.120 --> 13:55.170
She's basically lost everything.

13:55.170 --> 13:56.460
Anyway, your whole world
is opening up.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.040
- I lost everything too.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.540
- I know. We all did.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.880
But this is how you're
gonna pull yourself up.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.210
Let the good things happen.

14:07.210 --> 14:10.080
- Just comes in waves, you know.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.120
- Yeah, tell me about it.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.920
- You really made me look
like an idiot, you know.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.290
- Juliette!

14:28.290 --> 14:30.210
- You're supposed
to have my back,

14:30.210 --> 14:31.540
not stab me in it!

14:31.540 --> 14:33.460
- I didn't stab you in the back!

14:33.460 --> 14:34.750
Deacon put me on the spot.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.380
What was I supposed to do?
Lie?

14:37.380 --> 14:38.960
- Yes!

14:38.960 --> 14:40.500
- Well, excuse me
if I'm not willing

14:40.500 --> 14:43.120
to sell Hallie down
the corporate rabbit hole.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.500
I mean, it's not the kind
of artist she is.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.460
- I don't just see an artist.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.460
I see her as a star!

14:49.460 --> 14:51.080
- I don't know if you
even see her at all.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.250
- How can you say that to me?

14:53.250 --> 14:55.040
- When's the last time
you asked how she's doing?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.710
Or what's going on in her life?
I mean, did you even know

14:57.710 --> 14:59.380
that George broke up
with her last night?

15:02.330 --> 15:04.290
- Oh, my God.

15:04.290 --> 15:06.790
- She needs a friend right now.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.670
- Okay.

15:10.290 --> 15:13.500
- Okay what?
- I get it.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.540
She's going through
a rough time right now.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.170
We shouldn't push her.

15:18.170 --> 15:19.830
- I'm serious.

15:19.830 --> 15:22.290
- And I understand.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.790
This is about Hallie.
This is what Hallie wants.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.830
This is what Hallie should get.

15:27.830 --> 15:30.710
- So you're okay if we
record her own style...

15:30.710 --> 15:33.540
- Yes, I am.
I really am.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.170
- Juliette?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.170
- Really.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.500
- Okay.

15:44.540 --> 15:45.880
- Let me help you
with the dishes.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.290
- I've got it.
I'm good.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.920
- What in the Sam Hill
is a "shipper" anyway?

15:58.920 --> 16:00.830
- Well, apparently,
an online fan

16:00.830 --> 16:03.210
who knows more about our
relationship than we do.

16:03.210 --> 16:04.540
- Gross.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.500
Oh, my goodness,
they're everywhere.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.880
There's literally
like millions of people

16:08.880 --> 16:09.880
trying to name our baby.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.000
- Hey, look at this.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.580
They're writing about us like
we're characters in a book.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.000
- Those ones are
dressed up as us.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.250
- What? Where?
- There.

16:18.250 --> 16:22.250
- Oh, ugh...
that's weird.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.250
You know, maybe you should
cancel the interview tomorrow.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.380
- Well, I don't think
hiding from it's

16:27.380 --> 16:29.120
gonna make it any better.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.620
You know, they're gonna
find out anyway.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.750
- Yeah, but now everyone
believes it's mine.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.000
- Well, I don't care
what some bored 15-year-old

16:36.000 --> 16:39.040
from Nebraska
writes about us online.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.420
This is, you know, supposed
to be a fun and exciting time.

16:42.420 --> 16:45.330
And it's just--
- It can still be exciting.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.000
There's no point in getting
all miserable about it.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.580
It's not good for
the baby anyway.

16:49.580 --> 16:53.210
- I'm not all miserable
about it, I'm just--

16:53.210 --> 16:56.420
I wasn't ready for it to not
just be our business,

16:56.420 --> 16:58.380
that's all.
- It's still our business.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.710
It doesn't matter
what any of them think.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.420
- Thanks.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.960
- I'm so sorry.
My therapy ran late,

17:14.960 --> 17:17.670
and Cadence wouldn't go down.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.790
- Thank you.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.920
Thank you so much for
believing in me and my music.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.960
- You already heard?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.580
- Yeah. It's amazing.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.330
Avery called me this morning,
and told me everything.

17:30.330 --> 17:31.960
We start recording today.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.540
- Wow!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.420
- What's wrong?
Is it something I said?

17:38.420 --> 17:40.460
- No. Come on,

17:40.460 --> 17:44.000
I just wanted to be
the first to tell you.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.960
We've been through
so much together.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.750
I was hoping that I'd get to
tell you the amazing news.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.120
- Thank you.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.290
None of this would have been
possible without you.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.540
- Baby girl, this is all you.

17:55.540 --> 17:59.170
Don't ever feel like your career
depends on anybody else.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.080
I also heard about George
from Avery.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.620
I'm sorry.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.750
You know, if you
ever want to talk,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.920
I'm always here to listen.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.460
- Life is crazy.

18:09.460 --> 18:13.290
The highs are so high.
The lows are so low.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.580
- I think I know
what you're talking about.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.290
- So tell me about
that stunning performance

18:21.290 --> 18:23.460
on the music video.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.080
- Honestly, it's kind
of terrifying

18:25.080 --> 18:26.920
when somebody sees
something in you

18:26.920 --> 18:28.580
you didn't even know existed.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.210
- It certainly felt
like a departure

18:30.210 --> 18:32.460
from the good girl that we knew.

18:32.460 --> 18:35.790
It was a really passionate
display of sexuality.

18:35.790 --> 18:37.170
- Oh, thank you.
It wasn't very much fun,

18:37.170 --> 18:38.460
I can tell you that.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.250
- Hmm? How so?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.170
- Oh, it's not worth going into.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.540
I was going through
a rough time.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.460
And Damien pulled
out all that madness

18:45.460 --> 18:47.620
and passion from me.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.880
In a way, he set me free.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.000
- Well, that's Damien for you.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.500
- You know him?

18:53.500 --> 18:57.000
- Hmm?
You could say that, yeah.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.170
I could trust you.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.420
- Of course, you can.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.120
- Sorry.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.000
You know, we got totally
off topic, I apologize.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.250
- It's okay.
When did you...

19:14.250 --> 19:18.170
- Well, it was about a year
after my divorce.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.250
Five years ago...yeah.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.290
We were doing
a profile on Damien

19:22.290 --> 19:24.080
for our young auteurs piece

19:24.080 --> 19:29.790
And he was just so charming
and intelligent and handsome.

19:29.790 --> 19:33.460
Wow, I've actually never talked
to anyone about this before.

19:33.460 --> 19:38.250
- Oh, it's all right.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.880
- We totally had an affair.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.710
Yeah, and I've never
done anything like that

19:43.710 --> 19:45.750
before with someone
I've been interviewing.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.880
I mean, ever.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.120
- I can understand.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.420
- Wait. You too?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.920
Oh my God, you did.
You did!

19:58.920 --> 20:01.170
- Oh, no, I mean, the handsome
and charming bit.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.710
- You did too.

20:03.710 --> 20:06.500
- No, I wouldn't talk about it
in this setting.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.250
- Honey, we've gotten
so far off topic.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.580
I'm the one that's sitting here
completely exposed.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.830
- No, I didn't have an affair.
I don't--

20:12.830 --> 20:16.830
I can't go behind
peoples' backs, so no.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.790
- Well, good for you.

20:18.790 --> 20:21.670
I mean, you've nothing
to be ashamed about.

20:21.670 --> 20:24.670
Damien wants something,
Damien gets it, right?

20:24.670 --> 20:26.170
And look at you.

20:26.170 --> 20:28.420
I mean, who wouldn't want you?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.750
I get it.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.500
I was pretty messed up over him.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.170
He is...
He is one charming guy.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.670
- I'm sorry.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.170
- When exactly did
you shoot the video?

20:44.170 --> 20:45.920
I can't remember
which month it was.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.880
- Oh, it was a few months ago.
- I think it was in March.

20:53.750 --> 20:57.330
He's the father, isn't he?

20:57.330 --> 21:00.250
- Excuse me?

21:00.250 --> 21:01.620
- Sorry, it's none
of my business.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.460
- No, it's not.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.920
- What a mess!
I'm really sorry.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
- Well, you're not talking
about some news piece.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.210
You're talking about my child.

21:09.210 --> 21:10.750
You had no right
to bring that up.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.170
- I completely understand.
Do you want to just

21:12.170 --> 21:13.880
go back to the video?
- No, I don't.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.790
Actually, I'm not comfortable
talking to you anymore.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.500
- I'm sorry if I upset you.
- Oh, you didn't upset me.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.710
- I mean, you're
clearly very upset.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.920
- Yeah, well, I think...

21:19.920 --> 21:21.580
- I mean, I understand.
I would be really upset too.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.000
- You have a nice day.
- You too.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.830

25:00.460 --> 25:02.380
- What is it?

25:04.210 --> 25:05.620
- Country music's
highest flying couple

25:05.620 --> 25:07.540
just hit some major turbulence

25:07.540 --> 25:09.580
when Scarlett O'Connor revealed

25:09.580 --> 25:13.040
that Gunnar Scott is not
the father of her baby-to-be.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.960
According to
MacKenzie Rhodes' article

25:14.960 --> 25:17.170
in "33 1/3 " magazine,

25:17.170 --> 25:19.620
fair-flower Scarlett
had an affair

25:19.620 --> 25:22.500
with handsome English director,
Damien George,

25:22.500 --> 25:26.080
during the making of the duo's
latest music video.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.540
O'Connor has been
quoted as saying that,

25:27.540 --> 25:30.920
"Making the video helped
her find her sexuality,"

25:30.920 --> 25:33.750
apparently in
more ways than one.

25:33.750 --> 25:37.420
We'll see how their many fans
feel about this.

25:37.420 --> 25:39.500
- You told her. How could
you tell her, Scarlett?

25:39.500 --> 25:41.000
- I didn't tell her,
but it didn't matter.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.920
She figured it out anyway.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.620
- How could you do this?

25:44.620 --> 25:46.210
- Because I can't lie.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.500
And somehow she knew it.

25:51.620 --> 25:54.420
- And further, I regard it
as bestowed upon me,

25:54.420 --> 25:55.670
only in part.

25:55.670 --> 25:58.500
The larger share
belongs to my friends...

25:58.500 --> 26:01.040
- There you are!

26:01.040 --> 26:02.540
- Here I am.

26:02.540 --> 26:04.080
- I texted and called.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.790
I thought you were
swinging by the studio.

26:06.790 --> 26:10.000
- Wasn't feeling it.
- Oh, what a day!

26:10.000 --> 26:11.250
You were right about Hallie.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.750
She has an amazing instrument.

26:12.750 --> 26:17.290
Her control, her range,
everything, my God!

26:17.290 --> 26:19.620
- I know her a lot better
than you realize.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.290
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means?

26:22.290 --> 26:25.330
It means that sometimes we get
so caught up in someone,

26:25.330 --> 26:27.120
we don't see that someone
is very different

26:27.120 --> 26:29.000
than what we thought.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.670
- Am I missing something here?

26:30.670 --> 26:34.710
- Yes, and I would be
very careful if I were you.

26:34.710 --> 26:37.170
- Of what?

26:37.170 --> 26:40.120
- Of Hallie Jordan.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.120
Oh, don't look at me like that.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.000
Don't you see that
this is all an act?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.380
Little Miss Perfect

26:48.380 --> 26:51.000
who somehow always
gets whatever she wants?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.750
- Well, like someone
else I know.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.250
- Excuse me?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.830
I worked like hell
to get where I am.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.790
And I didn't use a girl
in a wheelchair

26:58.790 --> 27:00.170
to land a recording contract.

27:00.170 --> 27:02.000
- Oh, my God,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.080
did I just walk into
a Twilight Zone episode?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.460
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:06.460 --> 27:08.830
- Why do you think she
welcomed me into the church?

27:08.830 --> 27:12.420
- Because she's kind?

27:12.420 --> 27:14.250
- Oh, my God, you are so naive.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.380
Don't you get it?

27:16.380 --> 27:18.460
She saw an opportunity.
And she took it!

27:18.460 --> 27:22.250
- Okay, so she made the plane
crash in the field too.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.790
- You believe whatever you want.

27:24.790 --> 27:27.170
- Juliette, you're the one who
sought her out, remember?

27:27.170 --> 27:28.540
I mean, you
practically stalked her.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.170
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.960
Online, at the church.
Showed up at her house.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.710
You bought her a new SUV.

27:35.710 --> 27:39.500
You were one phone call away
from a restraining order.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.960
- Wow, she really
has you snowed.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.210
- Cut it out.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.790
- Let me ask you,
what happened between

27:48.790 --> 27:51.000
when I left the recording
studio yesterday?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.500
And when we met up
at Deacon's office?

27:52.500 --> 27:53.750
- What do you mean,
what happened?

27:53.750 --> 27:56.920
- We had a song,
a great song for her

27:56.920 --> 27:59.000
that we all agreed upon.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.750
- I can't believe
we're back to this.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.500
- Then she tells you
this little sob story

28:02.500 --> 28:05.460
about how she broke up
with her married boyfriend.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.460
Suddenly, you have this
epiphany about her sound?

28:07.460 --> 28:09.620
How convenient!
- You know what?

28:09.620 --> 28:11.290
This is offensive.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.580
- Honey, she is using you, okay?

28:13.580 --> 28:16.670
And your heart is just
too good to see it.

28:16.670 --> 28:18.620
Watch, watch.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.040
I'm gonna go check on Cadence.

28:34.210 --> 28:37.040
- All right, that's enough.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.210
We're gonna talk about this
whether you want to or not.

28:39.210 --> 28:42.380
- There's nothing to talk about.
- I agree.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.580
- At least you agree
on something.

28:45.580 --> 28:49.040
Daphne? You hurt your
sister very badly, okay?

28:49.040 --> 28:51.120
- Oh, God.
I apologized!

28:51.120 --> 28:52.380
She's hurt me a thousand times,
and never said sorry.

28:52.380 --> 28:54.830
- Such a lie.

28:54.830 --> 28:56.540
- Maddie, you went
to New York without me.

28:56.540 --> 28:59.080
- That wasn't my choice.
- You could have said something.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.330
- I can't believe you're
bringing this up right now!

29:00.330 --> 29:02.000
- God, you get everything,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.580
all the attention!
All the articles!

29:03.580 --> 29:04.960
- What do you want me
to do about it?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.380
Nothing?
Just because you're younger?

29:06.380 --> 29:08.000
- No! I want you to stop
being a bitch about it!

29:08.000 --> 29:09.880
- Daphne!
- She is!

29:09.880 --> 29:12.710
- Don't talk like that!
- You only care about yourself!

29:12.710 --> 29:13.790
- Liv was so right about you.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.460
- Okay, just don't be...
- You are such a brat!

29:15.460 --> 29:17.580
- You are not Mom!

29:17.580 --> 29:19.330
Mom was nice!
- Hey, Daphne!

29:19.330 --> 29:20.750
Stop it!
Both of you!

29:20.750 --> 29:22.670
Is that how your mother
raised you guys?

29:22.670 --> 29:24.620
To hurt each other like this?
What is going on here, huh?

29:24.620 --> 29:27.210
What are you doing?
- She started it, Dad.

29:27.210 --> 29:28.880
- You know nothing about me!

29:28.880 --> 29:31.750
- That is so wrong, Daphne!
- Daphne, she does care!

29:31.750 --> 29:33.000
- Why are you
always on her side?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.420
- I'm not on her side!

29:34.420 --> 29:35.750
I'm just telling you--
Daphne, stop!

29:35.750 --> 29:37.710
- You don't listen to me!
- Hey!

29:45.250 --> 29:47.880
- I'm going out for a while.
- Mm-hmm.

30:02.380 --> 30:04.380
- Are you okay?

30:04.380 --> 30:07.830
- No.

30:07.830 --> 30:09.210
- Well, remember,
Louise's mom

30:09.210 --> 30:10.460
is gonna pick you up
at 11, all right?

30:10.460 --> 30:12.540
- Yes, I know.

30:12.540 --> 30:16.120
- Okay, then.
I love you.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.170
I love you too, girl.

30:53.670 --> 30:56.620
- Ah...Oh, my goodness.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.670
- What you sleeping
on the couch for?

30:58.670 --> 31:02.620
- I sat down here for like
one minute at about 3 a.m.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.920
- What are you doing up
at 3 a.m.?

31:08.670 --> 31:12.040
- Scarlett had an affair
with handsome...

31:12.040 --> 31:14.830
- Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

31:14.830 --> 31:17.170
- It's stupid.
- It is stupid. It's stupid!

31:17.170 --> 31:18.830
- Why don't people have lives.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.670
Why are they so concerned
with what Gunnar and I do?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.420
- I don't think they do
have lives.

31:22.420 --> 31:24.210
- Oh, that woman has
made me look like

31:24.210 --> 31:25.380
the biggest slut
in the universe.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.750
- That's ridiculous, okay.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.540
- No, no, no--Google me.
You'll see.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.460
- I don't need to Google you.
I'm looking at you.

31:30.460 --> 31:32.040
I know you.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.580
Hey, the only opinions
that matter in this world

31:34.580 --> 31:37.420
are the people who love you.
You know that.

31:37.420 --> 31:40.250
- Yeah...There's enough
going on in private

31:40.250 --> 31:41.580
without it all being public.

31:41.580 --> 31:45.120
- Yeah, what's going on?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.460
- I had an ultrasound.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.420
- Mm-hmm.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.420
- It's a little girl.

31:53.420 --> 31:56.380
Don't start.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.500
- That's just about
the biggest news

31:58.500 --> 32:01.500
that I have ever heard!
Come here.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.920
- I know...No, it just hit me.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.790
She's not just gonna be a baby.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.790
She's gonna be a child
and a teenager.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.920
And a woman with dreams.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.920
What kind of world
is she gonna grow up in?

32:11.920 --> 32:14.080
How am I gonna protect her?

32:14.080 --> 32:17.040
She's gonna need me
to be strong for her.

32:17.040 --> 32:21.880
I need to be the mother
she deserves to have.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.880
And I don't think I am.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.670
- Honey, you are, you are!

32:27.670 --> 32:29.830
- I feel so weak.

32:29.830 --> 32:31.670
- You always feel weak, right?

32:31.670 --> 32:32.790
You could lift a truck
off a man.

32:32.790 --> 32:34.000
You'd still feel weak.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.330
- (laughing)
- You would!

32:36.330 --> 32:38.500
Look at me.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.880
You're gonna be a great mama.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.460
And you are gonna raise
an amazing little girl, you are.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.710
Just never knowing what's right,

32:46.710 --> 32:49.210
that's just part of being
a parent, all right?

32:49.210 --> 32:53.540
You just love her.
The rest will follow.

32:55.290 --> 32:57.380
- You always seem to know.

32:57.380 --> 33:00.210
- Don't I wish.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.790
Right now, my house looks like
an emotional bomb dropped on it.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.920
- What happened?

33:04.920 --> 33:08.620
- My ineptitude as a parent has
been made painfully clear.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.540
- I'm sorry, Daphne,

33:45.540 --> 33:47.420
for anything I ever did to you.

33:47.420 --> 33:51.380
I'm sorry for being
mean and selfish.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.420
But you hurt me really badly,

33:55.420 --> 33:57.670
and I understand.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.120
Everybody keeps talking about

34:02.120 --> 34:04.460
all the great things
happening to me.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.080
And I should be happy.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.540
You know, I should be grateful.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.080
And making the most
of this moment.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.380
But I just miss Mom!

34:12.880 --> 34:16.830
Every day, every hour,
I just want Mom.

34:16.830 --> 34:19.250
And she's not here!

34:19.250 --> 34:20.620
I don't know what
to do about it.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.170
- Me too.

34:24.790 --> 34:28.000
- I couldn't possibly
lose you, Daphne.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.670
I need you too much.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.380
I need you to help me
figure things out.

34:38.380 --> 34:42.170
'Cause I am so confused.

34:42.170 --> 34:44.670
- I need you too.

34:44.670 --> 34:46.880
I thought you were already gone.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.830
- I'm so not gone.

35:24.460 --> 35:25.920
- Oh, hey, that was all you.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.880
- No, it was not all me...
- Yes! Listen...

35:27.880 --> 35:29.620
- Because what you do like
the textures, the sounds...

35:29.620 --> 35:31.460
- No. It's your voice,
it's your songs.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.830
All I was doing
was moving the faders...

35:33.830 --> 35:35.620
- You know, I'm just
gonna leave you guys to it

35:35.620 --> 35:36.960
while I go pick up our daughter.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.670
- Juliette, what?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.120
- It's a song, Avery, a song.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.500
- I don't understand
what's going on?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.080
- You're not fooling anyone

35:45.080 --> 35:46.670
with your little
Miss Innocent routine.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.880
- Whoa, whoa.
Hey, what's wrong with you?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.710
- What's wrong with me?
- Yes!

35:51.710 --> 35:55.040
- Um, the smiles, the touching?
I saw it all.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.540
You think I'm an idiot!
I'm not an idiot.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.330
- Juliette, it's not like that.

35:59.330 --> 36:00.710
- It's totally not like that.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.120
- I think it is like that.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.290
And if you think
that I'm gonna sit here

36:04.290 --> 36:06.210
and watch her build
up her career

36:06.210 --> 36:08.120
while she wrecks my life,

36:08.120 --> 36:10.500
you are sadly mistaken.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.120
- You know, I don't know
where you get off

36:12.120 --> 36:13.170
talking about me like that.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.920
- By opening my eyes!

36:14.920 --> 36:17.040
- No, Hallie,
don't leave like this.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.460
You know what?
The craziest thing about this

36:18.460 --> 36:20.120
is that this isn't
even about me.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.830
You got problems?
Lord knows we all do.

36:23.830 --> 36:26.580
But you don't take them out
on the people who love you.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.920
- What--why are you
looking at me like that?

36:34.920 --> 36:38.000
- I'm literally worried
about you at this moment.

36:41.170 --> 36:45.500
I'm gonna go, not with her.

36:45.500 --> 36:49.080
And I want you to think really
hard about what just happened.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.290
- She lives here?

37:12.290 --> 37:14.380
- Until the cops kick them out.

37:16.670 --> 37:20.040
- Look who's here.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.080
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.080
I was hoping that
I wouldn't see you again.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.960
- Can we talk to you?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.540
- Yeah, sure, talk.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.000
- Liv...

37:43.670 --> 37:45.250
We want you
to come home with us.

37:45.250 --> 37:47.120
- I'm really sorry
for yelling at you.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.670
- Wow...
That's sort of amazing.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.080
- Okay.
Live, you can't stay here?

37:54.080 --> 37:57.250
- What about everybody else?

37:57.250 --> 37:59.210
Well, can we take them too?

37:59.210 --> 38:00.670
- How can we do that?

38:00.670 --> 38:02.380
- I don't know.
You tell me.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.830
- Liv, you are my friend.

38:03.830 --> 38:06.330
Let us help you.

38:06.330 --> 38:09.080
- Yeah, and they're
my friends, Daphne.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.790
- You don't want to stay here.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.040
- Except I do because
this is where I belong.

38:18.670 --> 38:21.710
- No, it's not.

38:21.710 --> 38:23.670
- I'm gonna go now.
I need to earn some bucks.

38:23.670 --> 38:26.000
- Okay, Liv?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.040
You have my number.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.380
- Yeah.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.960
See you around.
Thanks.

38:38.790 --> 38:41.620
- Girls?

38:41.620 --> 38:43.750
Where are you?

38:43.750 --> 38:46.080
Please come downstairs!

38:51.080 --> 38:53.330
Look, we need to talk
about last night.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.000
We can't go on like this,
all right?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I need y'all too much.
We all need each other.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.380
Somehow we're gonna have to find
a way where the three of us--

38:59.380 --> 39:01.500
(cell phone rings)
- Hello?

39:01.500 --> 39:03.290
- Can you not...
- Hey, Flynn.

39:03.290 --> 39:06.460
Yeah, here she is.

39:06.460 --> 39:07.960
- Yeah, um...

39:07.960 --> 39:09.420
Sorry, can you just hold
on, like, one second?

39:11.210 --> 39:12.750
You said she couldn't use
her phone for a month.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.540
So I said she could use mine.

39:15.540 --> 39:17.210
- We made up this morning.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.880
- So how was your day?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.620
- What's up?
- Can we eat? I'm starving.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.830
- Oh yeah, is Amelia's party
still going on?
