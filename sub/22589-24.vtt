<i>NARRATOR".
When last we saw the Caped Crusader...</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:21.147
<i>...he was at the altar about to be married...</i>

00:21.356 --> 00:25.860
<i>...to the diabolical Marsha,
Queen of Diamonds.</i>

00:26.194 --> 00:29.113
<i>Only the words "I do"...</i>

00:29.322 --> 00:33.576
<i>...stand between him
and the bonds of wedlock.</i>

01:52.780 --> 01:54.574
<i>l.</i>

01:56.326 --> 01:57.452
<i>l.</i>

01:57.660 --> 01:59.287
Say "I do."

01:59.495 --> 02:03.124
- I...
- Stop the wedding.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.092
This is no time for pranks, my good man.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.553
We are in the midst of a sacred ceremony.

02:15.762 --> 02:18.389
I assure you, sir, this is no prank.

02:18.598 --> 02:19.849
Who are you?

02:20.058 --> 02:22.560
Ethelbert Soames, solicitor at law...

02:22.769 --> 02:25.438
...with the firm
of Soames, Stillwell and Thistlewaite...

02:25.938 --> 02:28.316
...Liverpool, England. My card.

02:30.485 --> 02:33.613
My card. My card.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.494
- What has this to do with the wedding?
-Allow me to present my client.

02:39.702 --> 02:45.375
Formerly Miss Henrietta Tillitson
of Morton in the Marsh, Gloucestershire.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.168
What do you mean "formerly"?

02:47.377 --> 02:52.715
I mean that for the last seven years,
she has been Mrs. Batman.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.386
Mrs. Batman?

02:57.303 --> 03:01.808
Yes. If you'd care
to examine the wedding certificate.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.395
Duly attested by the registrar
at Morton in the Marsh...

03:05.603 --> 03:08.481
...and, uh, dated seven years ago.

03:08.690 --> 03:11.234
Why didn't you tell me about this, Batman?

03:11.442 --> 03:15.655
- Eh, uh-- It slipped my mind.
-Slipped your mind, indeed.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.158
I am not in the practice
of marrying bigamists.

03:20.702 --> 03:23.830
Why, you two-timing Batfink!

03:24.163 --> 03:28.584
How dare you leave a poor, defenseless girl
waiting at the altar?

03:28.793 --> 03:30.503
Not poor, I hope, madam.

03:30.712 --> 03:34.674
We are instituting a lawsuit for $1 million...

03:34.882 --> 03:37.510
...for the alienation
of the husband's affections.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.680
Ah! Let's get out of here.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.900
Mrs. Cooper.

03:53.109 --> 03:56.612
Why, I wasn't sure you'd remember me,
Batman.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.907
Of course I remember you.
I've always treasured our brief meetings.

04:00.116 --> 04:03.244
And I certainly wanna thank you
for the help you gave me here today.

04:03.453 --> 04:04.746
Oh, I'm glad.

04:04.954 --> 04:08.916
I was afraid you'd be angry with us
for stretching the truth the way we did.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.502
Not under the circumstances, believe me.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.755
If we can be of any further service, sir.

04:13.963 --> 04:17.341
- As a matter of fact, Mr...
-Alfred will do, sir.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.510
As a matter of fact, Alfred, yes.

04:19.719 --> 04:24.557
Robin is out of commission, I'd appreciate it
if you would accompany me in the Batmobile.

04:24.766 --> 04:28.186
Certainly, sir. I've always wanted to ride
in that ingenious vehicle.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.981
Good. Again my thanks, Mrs. Cooper.

04:32.190 --> 04:36.068
You were truly superb.

04:40.573 --> 04:44.660
Oh, Bruce will never believe it
when I tell him.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.166
We'll have to get to Robin
as soon as possible.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.878
We'll have to drive it as it is.

04:56.714 --> 05:01.052
Anticipating an emergency, sir,
I've brought along a kit of Bat Antidotes.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.386
Good thinking, Alfred.

05:02.595 --> 05:05.681
Incidentally, I forged the marriage certificate
on the Bat Printer.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.351
A remarkable invention of yours,
if I may say so.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.103
Yes, it did the job this time.

05:20.613 --> 05:23.449
The sleep potion I gave before the wedding
is still in effect.

05:23.658 --> 05:28.120
Good. Pump another potion
into Boy Wonder there...

05:28.329 --> 05:30.122
...and he'll worship me forever.

05:30.331 --> 05:34.627
Then I'll make him lead me to the Batcave,
and the Bat Diamond will be mine.

05:34.836 --> 05:39.048
Hurry, hurry! Before that Bat Bigamist
partner of his shows up.

05:39.257 --> 05:41.050
Yes, Your Highness.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.221
Where are my Guardians?

05:45.555 --> 05:47.682
They were held up in traffic, Your Highness.

05:48.099 --> 05:51.602
Forget the Boy Wonder. Out this door.

05:56.107 --> 05:59.068
Never mind about them, Alfred.
Our first concern is Robin.

05:59.277 --> 06:01.904
Quickly! The Bat Antidotes.

06:02.238 --> 06:07.660
We'll use the general all-purpose Bat Antidote
and hope that it takes effect.

06:09.579 --> 06:11.706
Robin. Robin.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.087
It looks like it's working, Alfred.

06:18.296 --> 06:21.465
What happened, Batman?
How did I get in here?

06:21.674 --> 06:24.510
It's a long story, Robin. I'll explain later.

06:24.719 --> 06:28.222
Alfred, give Chief O'Hara and the commissioner
each one of those tablets.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.684
- Tell the commissioner to meet me at the office.
-Yes, sir.

06:31.893 --> 06:33.936
- Think you can make it, Robin?
-I think so.

06:34.145 --> 06:36.022
- I feel woozy.
-I know.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.900
We'll take you to the Batcave
where you can get some rest.

06:39.108 --> 06:41.903
And we can try to deduce
the Queen of Diamonds' next move.

06:42.111 --> 06:46.407
She'll stop at nothing to get her hands
on the Bat Diamond.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.999
Can't an old lady take a bath
without being interrupted?

06:55.207 --> 06:59.086
Your potion failed, darling. Miserably.

06:59.295 --> 07:02.965
A good hot bath does wonders
for the arthritis.

07:03.174 --> 07:07.595
Please, darling, pay attention
when I'm talking to you.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.639
What is it, deary? The potion?

07:09.847 --> 07:12.808
Oh, yes. Well, I knew it wouldn't work.

07:13.017 --> 07:17.772
Those newts I've been getting lately
are very poor quality.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.524
Well, you're going to have to think
of something else.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.985
I have to get inside that Batcave.

07:23.194 --> 07:27.615
I've been in dozens of bat caves, deary.
They're very dull.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.368
This is a very special Batcave.

07:30.576 --> 07:34.205
Take it from me, when you've seen
one bat cave, you've seen them all.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.958
Suppose you let me worry about that.

07:37.166 --> 07:41.963
You're going to have to think of something
to put those caped clowns in my power.

07:42.171 --> 07:47.927
Oh, all right, darling. All right.
Fetch me my recipe book. It's over there.

07:52.848 --> 07:53.891
Is this the one?

07:54.100 --> 07:57.186
Is there a buzzard's tongue lying next to it?

07:57.395 --> 07:58.437
Yes. Ew.

07:58.938 --> 08:00.398
Then that's the one, deary.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.411
Ah. How about a potion
to make them vanish?

08:13.619 --> 08:15.287
No, no, no, darling.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.291
I want them to lead me
to the Batcave and the Bat Diamond.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.793
Just put them in my power.

08:21.002 --> 08:24.046
Here's a nice little potion
that turns them into tigers.

08:24.255 --> 08:25.506
Too large, darling.

08:25.715 --> 08:26.924
Mosquitoes?

08:27.133 --> 08:29.719
- Too small, darling.
-Ha-ha-ha.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.929
Here's an old potion I haven't used in years.

08:33.139 --> 08:35.390
It turns them into nice fuzzy little rabbits.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.058
That's the one.

08:37.268 --> 08:41.313
Unless, of course, they have type-O blood...

08:41.522 --> 08:46.360
...in which case it turns them
into giant boa constrictors.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.697
Find another potion, darling.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.007
The Bat Diamond.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.222
What about it, Robin?

09:15.473 --> 09:18.434
To think it's the cause of all this trouble.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.771
People call it many different things,
old chum.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.232
Passion, lust, desire, avarice.

09:25.441 --> 09:29.570
But the simplest
and most understandable word is "greed."

09:29.779 --> 09:32.823
Why would Marsha want
that particular diamond? She can't wear it.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.533
You can't wear Michelangelos.

09:34.742 --> 09:39.080
You can't wear vintage cars
or old stamps or coins.

09:39.288 --> 09:44.168
But to certain collectors, they're a way of life.
In fact, life itself.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.421
Cars and stamps and coins
I can understand.

09:47.630 --> 09:51.383
But where would she find a place
to put that diamond of that size?

09:51.592 --> 09:55.179
That's an academic question, Robin.
She's not going to get it.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.640
Gosh, I hope not.

09:58.057 --> 10:02.686
When you got me out of that bird cage,
you said it was a long story...

10:02.895 --> 10:04.855
...and you'd explain it later.
Just what happened?

10:05.064 --> 10:08.609
To you? The same thing that happened to me.
A cupid's dart.

10:08.818 --> 10:11.654
I felt it. But she said it wasn't poisoned.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.574
Probably not in the true sense
of the word "poison"...

10:15.783 --> 10:19.662
...but certainly
it contained some secret ingredient...

10:19.870 --> 10:23.374
...by which your sense and your will
were affected.

10:23.582 --> 10:27.503
We were shot by the same type of dart
and it didn't affect you the same way.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.382
Oh, it did, Robin. it did. I just called
on all my resources to combat it.

10:31.590 --> 10:36.846
I called on all mine too, but all of a sudden,
there I was on my knees, worshiping her.

10:37.054 --> 10:41.392
Oh, it's merely the difference
of a few years, old chum.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.146
An older head can't be put
on younger shoulders.

10:45.354 --> 10:49.150
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara
have older heads, look what happened to them.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.985
Yes, I know. It wasn't pretty.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.695
But first things first.

10:52.903 --> 10:56.991
If you're back in fighting form,
let's have a go at the Batcomputer.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.910
Instead of Marsha finding the Bat Diamond...

11:00.119 --> 11:03.914
...perhaps the Bat Diamond
can lead us to Marsha.

11:04.123 --> 11:08.252
We know she's surrounded by diamonds,
and perhaps if we set the Batradar...

11:08.460 --> 11:10.754
...at the emanating frequency of diamonds...

11:10.963 --> 11:13.924
...we could calculate the reflection pattern
of the diamonds.

11:14.133 --> 11:17.803
Make them show up on the Batradar screen
and then figure out the coordinates.

11:18.012 --> 11:19.555
Right.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.394
All set, Batman.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.438
What are the numbers?

11:28.606 --> 11:33.861
Got it, Batman. The coordinates
are four, six, seven and nine, eight, one.

11:34.361 --> 11:39.116
Four, six, seven.

11:39.325 --> 11:43.245
Nine, eight, one. Elevation?

11:44.705 --> 11:47.374
Holy stalactites, Batman.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.752
The elevation is minus 80.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.171
Minus 80.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.803
- Just as I thought.
-Where is it?

12:03.265 --> 12:04.516
Yes?

12:04.725 --> 12:07.686
-It's good to hear your voice, commissioner.
-And yours, Batman.

12:07.895 --> 12:12.066
If it hadn't been for you, the chief and I
would be singing love songs to that woman.

12:12.274 --> 12:16.070
And if it hadn't been for that resourceful citizen
who saved me at the altar...

12:16.278 --> 12:17.947
...I'd be on my honeymoon right now.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.533
I'd like to send that wretched creature
on a honeymoon to state prison.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.994
And I think I know where she is.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.915
It wouldn't be that basement
of the building we were in, would it?

12:28.123 --> 12:30.960
Why, yes. She made a remark
about visiting her aunt there.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.712
But how could you possibly know?

12:34.296 --> 12:37.383
Occasionally, we men come up
with a few tricks too, commissioner.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.134
Robin and I are on our way there.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.720
Be careful, Batman.
She may be waiting for you.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.598
Don't worry, commissioner.
We'll be ready for her.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.729
There is no mystery that man can't solve.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.286
Be careful, Batman.

13:05.494 --> 13:10.457
<i>There are some mysteries no man can solve.</i>

13:18.966 --> 13:22.636
As Batman said, if it hadn't been for you,
he'd be on his honeymoon right now.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.471
The Caped Crusader is too kind.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.392
After all, I only did what any citizen
of Gotham City would have done.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.102
And lucky you did, sir.

13:30.311 --> 13:33.022
Yes. Good thinking,
and very inventive, I might add.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.567
Producing a past wife of Batman's
who never existed. Ha, ha.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.069
Oh, but she very definitely exists, sir.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.363
Batman's ex-wife?

13:41.572 --> 13:46.827
No, no, no. The lady who played the part, sir.
Mrs. Harriet Cooper, Dick Grayson's aunt.

13:47.036 --> 13:50.873
In fact, it was her idea.
I'm giving credit where credit is due.

13:51.623 --> 13:57.296
Now I know where I've heard your voice before.
Aren't you Alfred, the Wayne butler?

13:57.504 --> 13:58.797
Yes. Yes, sir, I am.

13:59.006 --> 14:04.136
Well, Alfred, if I ever need a wife
on the spur of the moment, I'll know--

14:04.428 --> 14:07.014
Begorra, I forgot.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.683
Bonnie said that my wife called
when I was out...

14:09.892 --> 14:11.560
...and I haven't called her back.

14:11.769 --> 14:13.395
The same with me, Chief O'Hara.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.939
For the same reason,
Commissioner Gordon?

14:16.148 --> 14:19.526
Well, being a wife, I'm sure she wonders
about my temporary absence...

14:19.735 --> 14:21.570
...from the office as well as from home.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.531
And being a husband,
what do you plan to tell her?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.408
The truth. What else?

14:26.617 --> 14:29.620
That you were hit by a cupid's dart?

14:29.828 --> 14:33.582
That you pleaded for the Queen of Diamonds'
love on your knees?

14:33.791 --> 14:36.460
That you were locked in a gilded cage?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.796
It does sound rather far-fetched, doesn't it?

14:39.004 --> 14:41.590
Sure, and I couldn't have made up
such a story myself.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.467
The wife never would believe it.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.011
If I may interject a thought.

14:46.470 --> 14:47.679
- Please do.
-Please do.

14:48.222 --> 14:52.684
My experience with women has been that
they tend to believe what they want to believe.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.980
So knowing you both to be conscientious
gentlemen and faithful husbands...

14:57.398 --> 15:00.859
...I'm sure that if you just tell both your wives
that you were involved...

15:01.068 --> 15:04.279
...in some special and,
uh, confidential assignment...

15:04.488 --> 15:05.739
...that will suffice.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.991
Have you ever been married?

15:08.826 --> 15:11.495
Eh-- Well, no, no.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.664
Alfred, at the risk of sounding pompous...

15:13.872 --> 15:17.376
...experience with women
and experience with wives...

15:17.584 --> 15:19.545
...are two vastly different things.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.588
Amen.

15:22.005 --> 15:26.760
Well, we've all learned something
from this little escapade, have we not?

15:26.969 --> 15:31.014
And now if you'll excuse me, I must be
getting back to my duties at Wayne Manor.

15:31.223 --> 15:35.519
- Of course, Alfred, and thank you again.
-Commissioner. Chief O'Hara.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.235
If you care to use my private phone
to call home, Chief O'Hara.

15:43.444 --> 15:46.613
- After you, Commissioner Gordon.
-Oh, no, no, no, please. After you.

15:46.822 --> 15:50.159
No, sir. No, sir. It's your office and your phone.
You go right ahead.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.039
Are you sure this potion will work, darling?

15:56.248 --> 15:57.791
I think so, deary.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.795
Of course there's always a certain amount
of luck in these things, you know.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.007
Once, when I was a chemistry professor
at Vassar, I--

16:05.215 --> 16:07.801
Darling, please,
enough of your academic past.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.304
Let's concentrate on the present.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.265
Now, Batman and Robin
have already tripped the outer alarm.

16:13.474 --> 16:15.517
They should be on their way down here
right now.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.772
Ah. Our guinea pigs have arrived.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.279
Holy trolls and goblins.

16:27.488 --> 16:32.034
Welcome, darlings.
Welcome to Aunt Hilda's little den.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.995
- She has a surprise for you.
-Careful, Robin.

16:35.537 --> 16:41.043
I'm sorry, Batman, but I'm afraid
I must turn you and Robin into mice.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.462
- Mice?
-Mice?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.631
Whee!

16:46.089 --> 16:47.841
What is it, Batman?

16:48.050 --> 16:49.384
I can't tell, Robin.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.386
It seems harmless enough.

16:51.595 --> 16:56.767
- You bumbling old hag, you failed again!
-That's no way to talk to an old lady.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.686
You mind your own business,
Boy Wonder.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.731
You're going to be in enough trouble
as it is.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.776
Yes, Your Highness?

17:06.443 --> 17:07.653
Dispatch them.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.239
Yes, Your Highness.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.618
A caldron of creeps, Batman.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.954
Well put, Robin.

17:27.172 --> 17:30.133
I'm sure this one will work.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.636
It's guaranteed to turn them into lizards.

17:32.844 --> 17:37.391
You said the last one would have them
running around on the floor squeaking.

17:37.599 --> 17:43.313
This time I'll add a little more,
just to make sure.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.663
Missed again.

18:02.583 --> 18:07.504
I don't know what's wrong.
Nothing seems to be working today.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.924
This one has to work.
It's one of my best potions.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.387
It better be, darling.
My Guardians are falling like ninepins.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.402
Oh!

18:32.112 --> 18:33.905
Another zero.

18:34.114 --> 18:39.411
Playtime is over, darling.
Let the grownups take charge.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.044
Diamond dozing gas, Batman.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.713
Try not to breathe.

19:00.599 --> 19:04.853
This is my most powerful potion.
It's never failed.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.438
Like all the others?

19:06.647 --> 19:11.401
I'll guarantee this will turn them
into a pair of toads.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.613
I'll stake my reputation on it.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.573
You haven't much to lose.

19:16.782 --> 19:22.496
A pair of wriggling little toads.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.794
No word yet from Batman.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.588
L-- I'm getting worried, chief.

19:31.797 --> 19:33.090
Me too, commissioner.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.718
That felonious female
is a devilish customer, all right.

19:36.927 --> 19:40.055
Batman and Robin can handle
any male criminal in Gotham City...

19:40.263 --> 19:41.848
...but when it comes to women--

19:42.057 --> 19:46.269
When it comes to women,
Batman's the big loser, darling.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.481
A very big loser.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.072
What kind of trickery is this?

19:57.280 --> 20:00.242
- Where are Batman and Robin?
-Right here.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.370
Say hello to the commissioner, Bat Toad.

20:03.578 --> 20:07.249
The woman's gone daft.
She's taken leave of her senses.

20:07.958 --> 20:11.461
I'm afraid it's true, commissioner.
We're right here.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.213
She's got us.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.967
Saints preserve us.
The whole world's come unhinged.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.052
I'll take Circe.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.806
Say something to Chief O'Hara, Robin Toad.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.186
Holy hors d'oeuvres, Chief O'Hara.
Keep that cat away from us.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.772
Robin, you poor boy.

20:30.981 --> 20:33.233
Commissioner, is it possible?

20:33.442 --> 20:34.776
Chief, I just don't know.

20:34.985 --> 20:38.029
But you remember what she did to us
with that love potion of hers.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.741
She's diabolical, all right.

20:40.949 --> 20:45.036
The Dynamic Duo a pair of toads?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.248
Oh, what will become of Gotham City now?

20:48.457 --> 20:51.835
I don't know about Gotham City, darlings...

20:52.043 --> 20:54.838
...but Batman and Robin
will become cat food...

20:55.046 --> 20:57.299
...unless I get my hands
on the Bat Diamond.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.719
Oh. Batman...

21:00.927 --> 21:02.137
...what should we do?

21:02.345 --> 21:04.139
Better do what she says, commissioner.

21:04.347 --> 21:09.728
Otherwise, Robin and I will end up
inside that fat cat.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.731
Gosh, Batman, I'm too young to be eaten.

21:12.939 --> 21:13.982
Don't worry, Robin.

21:14.191 --> 21:18.445
I'm sure Commissioner Gordon will cooperate
with the Queen of Diamonds.

21:18.653 --> 21:23.158
But, Batman,
I don't know where the Batcave is.

21:23.366 --> 21:26.161
That's right, Batman.
Nobody does but you and Robin.

21:26.495 --> 21:30.832
I'm sure you could find out
if you use that darling red phone.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.710
Should we do it, Batman?

21:34.169 --> 21:35.420
Yes, commissioner.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.465
- Oh, commissioner.
-Yes, Batman?

21:38.673 --> 21:40.050
Never mind the phone.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.511
- Who said that?
-Not me, Your Highness.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.347
The real Batman said it. Look over here.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.599
The Dynamic Duo themselves.

21:47.808 --> 21:50.894
Saints be praised. You're not toads after all.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.188
No, we're quite human, Chief O'Hara.

21:53.396 --> 21:58.318
But, Batman, how could those two toads
talk just like you and Robin?

21:58.527 --> 22:00.946
Oh, darling, it was a simple little prank.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.532
- Some prank.
-The Queen of Diamonds was relying...

22:03.740 --> 22:06.868
...on the Grand Mogul's ability
as a ventriloquist to deceive you.

22:07.077 --> 22:11.331
But, Batman, the Bat Toad talked
in your noble voice just a moment ago.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.624
So it did.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.627
You see, Batman knows a trick or two
about ventriloquism.

22:15.836 --> 22:19.506
And a few tricks
about getting out of barred cells.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.259
I was wondering
how you managed that, darling.

22:22.467 --> 22:26.888
Thanks to the extraordinary
transmitting powers of the Bat Diamond...

22:27.097 --> 22:28.431
...which you've been after...

22:28.640 --> 22:32.811
...we were able to carry on some long-distance
computations in the Batcave.

22:33.019 --> 22:36.481
After we wired the bars of the cell
to convert them to a radio aerial.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.775
You see, the tumbler lock on the cell door...

22:38.984 --> 22:45.365
...only had 3,724,521 possible combinations.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.784
Child's play for the Batcomputer.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.453
That was very clever of you, darling.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.455
Take care of them.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.624
Take care of them, I said.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.422
- Pinned like a wriggling toad.
-So...

23:01.172 --> 23:04.926
Well, I suppose this is the end
of my little romp, eh, darlings?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.929
A one- to 10-year end, at least.

23:08.138 --> 23:12.559
I just hope it's taught you that diamonds
aren't necessarily a girl's best friend, Marsha.

23:12.976 --> 23:16.730
Oh, Batman, darling...

23:16.938 --> 23:20.734
...you are so divinely square.

23:44.841 --> 23:49.220
Now, girls, after you've added
the baking powder and salt...

23:49.429 --> 23:53.350
...throw in a dash of ground lizard
to give it flavor.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.185
Ground lizard?

23:56.144 --> 23:59.773
Did I say ground lizard?
I meant garlic, of course.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.776
Then a teaspoon-full of oregano.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.237
All the time Aunt Hilda was a frustrated cook.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.908
Yes, I think she'll be much happier
with her recipes than with her potions.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.953
I just hope
she doesn’t turn the students into toads.

24:13.578 --> 24:17.749
Bruce, would you believe it
if I told you I have a wart on my thumb?

24:18.041 --> 24:20.377
Yes, I'd believe it, Dick.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.587
But who else would?

24:25.465 --> 24:30.220
