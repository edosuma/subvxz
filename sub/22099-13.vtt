Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I can't live like this.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.280
So, I won't divorce
and you won't cheat.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.367
So, where does
that leave us?

00:34.451 --> 00:35.451

Dear God, tell me
the truth before I die.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.714
Sorry. Improvising.

You're doing
the right thing, Gaius.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.980
Gaius?
What?

02:32.903 --> 02:36.072

03:24.204 --> 03:25.454
Wait a moment.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.292
I need some time
to think this through.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.419
Too late, Gaius.

Sorry, sir.

No one's allowed to speak to the prisoner
without direct Presidential authorization.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.531
I already have authorization. I
need to speak to the prisoner, now.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.908
Step back, sir.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.122
That's it, Gaius.

Deep breaths.

You're doing wonderfully.

I'm alive.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.997
Thank God, I'm alive!

04:50.165 --> 04:52.208
I always told you
to have faith.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.129
Then no one was betrayed.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.216
I was never one of them.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.552
I am one of you.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.846
Is that what
you think, Gaius?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.893
I knew it. I knew it.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.730
I always knew
I was different.

I've seen a bar before.

do. I'm not going home tonight, so...

Why? You and Cally
have a fight?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.461
You didn't hear us? I figured
we could have sold tickets.

dangers of sleep deprivation.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.568
Psychosis can make
a man do strange things.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.572
And Baltar's little hunger
strike is not helping, either.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.741
Bastard wants to die
that bad, I say let him.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.077
Bottom line,
we need Baltar to talk.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.621
If the other Cylons saw
the same symbols that we saw,

08:17.706 --> 08:18.914
they could be
on their way to Earth.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.500
They could be setting up
an ambush by now.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.003
I'm betting that after
tonight, he'll be more willing.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.964
Doc, wait an hour or two.
I want him cogent.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.758
I also don't
want him to starve.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.678
What do you expect me
to do about it?

08:32.762 --> 08:34.972
I expect you
to make sure he eats.

Mr. Gaeta?

08:52.073 --> 08:56.785
What exactly were you doing going to see
Dr. Baltar in the middle of the night?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.995
Um...

08:59.539 --> 09:00.706
I couldn't sleep,

09:00.790 --> 09:04.293
and I guess I thought he
might be willing to talk to me.

09:05.629 --> 09:09.215
We understand. Just leave
his interrogation to us.

09:09.925 --> 09:10.966
Of course.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.023
You're up late.

You know, I would invite you, but you
made it very clear it's not your thing.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.629
No, it's your thing, and
that's not what I was asking.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.384
I got a briefing at 0500.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.975
Are we still on
for dinner tomorrow?

10:01.518 --> 10:02.559
Yeah.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.937
Because I already
switched watches. Sure.

Hi.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.883
TouchÃ©, Madam President.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.761
I have no wish
to see you suffer.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.845
Really?

11:23.224 --> 11:28.312
I've just had the pleasure of having a
tube forced up my nose and down my throat.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.272
Everybody's got to eat.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.441
It's for your own good.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.446
And it's nothing compared to what
many of our people were subjected to

11:37.530 --> 11:39.948
in your jail cells
on New Caprica.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.621
Not my jails.
The Cylons'.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.290
An academic distinction
at this point, Doctor.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.959
You know, none of us
are enjoying this.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.379
So why don't you just tell me
what I need to know,

11:53.463 --> 11:56.924
and your suffering will come to
an end. And I promise you this.

11:58.343 --> 12:02.096
I know nothing about the Cylons'
plans or their whereabouts.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.015
I witnessed nothing
in that Temple.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.144
My information
on Cylon intelligence

12:11.147 --> 12:13.440
is limited,
to say the least.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.404
Prior to the attack on the Colonies, did
you have high-level security clearance?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.739
Yeah. So, what? Did you
tell anybody about it?

12:20.824 --> 12:23.242
Did you let someone
into the defense mainframe?

12:23.326 --> 12:24.410
Careful, Gaius.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.747
The blonde woman that I saw you with
on Caprica just prior to the attack?

12:28.832 --> 12:32.376
She'll flush you out of an airlock
without a moment's hesitation.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.676
Unless, of course, that
prospect no longer frightens you.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.433
Lies.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.519
All lies.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.360
A rehash of all
the other old lies.

13:01.865 --> 13:06.368
I did not collude in the
genocide of my own people.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.546
Mmm.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.510
This is Devlin and Maryanne
McAllister and their son and daughter.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.637
This is a family of four
that was gunned down

13:25.722 --> 13:27.514
in their own home
on suspicion of harboring...

13:27.599 --> 13:29.266
I am not responsible.
... insurgents.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.102
Just wondering if you recognize
even one of these faces.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.979
Did any image
get through to you

13:34.063 --> 13:36.690
on the rare occasion
when you ventured out...

13:36.816 --> 13:38.525
I am not responsible... ...
from behind your sand bags...

13:38.610 --> 13:39.902
...for the occupation...
... and your razor wire...

13:39.986 --> 13:41.403
...any more than I am
for the genocide.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.324
...to see what was happening
to your people? Your people!

13:46.409 --> 13:50.662
I need to know! Now!
Colonel Tigh, get in here!

13:50.788 --> 13:52.498
Get this man out of here.
This is not about uncovering...

13:52.582 --> 13:54.166
He's not gonna talk.
... any legitimate threat.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.542
I want you to take him.
I want you to toss him...

13:55.627 --> 13:57.169
This is about getting...
... out the nearest airlock.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.670
...your pound of flesh!
About frakking time.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.047
You guards,
get in here, now!

14:00.089 --> 14:02.466
What happened to my fair trial? Get
rid of him! Take him out of here!

14:02.550 --> 14:05.677
Take your hands off me! Get your
mother-frakking hands off me!

14:05.762 --> 14:09.515
I demand a fair trial! I am
a citizen of the Colonies,

14:09.599 --> 14:13.435
and I demand a fair trial!
A fair trial!

14:13.978 --> 14:15.479
ROSLIN:
Take a good look, Doctor.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.649
These are just a fraction of the
people you sent to their death.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.443
Rather fitting they should
see you take your last steps.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.864
Stop! Stop! Wait! Stop!
What? What!

14:25.949 --> 14:27.574
You asked if I know any
of these people. Yes!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.577
I know that man. Show
me! Show me! Let him go!

14:30.662 --> 14:32.871
Let him go!
Keep your guns on him!

14:32.956 --> 14:35.040

His name was Adrien Bauer.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.251
He was my lab assistant
for three years on Caprica.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.627
So, what?
He was Gemonese.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.463
I got him a visa. I
introduced him to his wife.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.090
I am godfather
to their first child.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.551
I wouldn't do anything to
harm this man or his family.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.470
Or anybody's family!
I am not a murderer!

14:48.555 --> 14:50.889
I am innocent!
Why won't you believe me?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.975
Get it! Take him out here!

14:53.059 --> 14:55.227
Is this what you call Colonial
justice? GUARD: Get him up.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.979
What did I ever
do for you, huh?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.981
Only saved
your bleeding life!

14:59.315 --> 15:00.732
(BALTAR SCREAMS)

15:11.995 --> 15:15.122
You gave it your best shot.
I understand.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.165
Yeah, but the bastard
still wouldn't talk.

15:19.210 --> 15:23.255
Either he's got more stones
than I gave him credit for, or...

15:23.339 --> 15:25.257
Or he knew
you were bluffing.

15:26.509 --> 15:30.679
Well, what do we do
with him now?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.350
There is one thing.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.021
Admiral?

15:44.485 --> 15:50.198
Military once ran an experimental
interrogation program involving drugs.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.993
Hallucinogens, specifically.

15:53.077 --> 15:58.123
The goal of the program was to
create a state of anxiety so intense

15:58.207 --> 16:02.169
that the subject believed that
their very survival was at stake.

16:04.005 --> 16:07.549
Interrogators
would exploit that,

16:07.634 --> 16:11.345
become less an adversary
and more a lifeline.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.640
At least, that was the idea.
It might get Baltar to talk,

16:14.724 --> 16:16.808
tell us what the Cylons
know about Earth.

16:16.893 --> 16:21.063
But it's dangerous, especially
for someone in Baltar's condition.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.029
Are you telling me we have
these drugs aboard Galactica?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.418
You're being awfully
accommodating.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.090
Is that how
it looks to you?

16:50.218 --> 16:53.804
Your estranged, two-timing bitch of
a wife calls you up for a quickie,

16:53.888 --> 16:56.014
and you hop on
the first shuttle?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.641
I'd say yeah.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.894
I've been thinking
about some stuff, Kara.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.938
Oh, yeah? Like what?

17:05.441 --> 17:06.566
(SIGHS)

17:08.736 --> 17:09.945
Like...

17:11.948 --> 17:14.533
What that crazy skin
job Leoben said about you

17:14.617 --> 17:18.787
and your special destiny. What
if there's something to that?

17:25.128 --> 17:28.088
Kara Thrace
and her special destiny?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.966
That sounds more like
a bad cover band, Sam.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.676
Think about it, though.

17:35.138 --> 17:39.433
Why did I survive all of those months
on Caprica, waiting for you to return,

17:39.517 --> 17:42.060
if I was just gonna
walk out on you?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.021
And you...

17:45.106 --> 17:47.649
I mean, did you go through that
hell, locked in that fake house

17:47.734 --> 17:50.986
with that fake husband,
just so you could ditch me?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.071
I don't think so.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.616
You know, when I think
about it like that...

18:05.334 --> 18:06.501
Do you love him?

18:08.838 --> 18:09.838
What?

18:10.590 --> 18:14.217
Lee. Kara, do you love Lee?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.637
Gods, Sam, I...

18:26.856 --> 18:29.900
Maybe. I don't know.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.362
Then you gotta go to him.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.701
I thought you were off duty.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.578
I am. Yeah.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.539
I was just gonna stop by
the bar for a little while.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.755
If you're gonna see Kara,
just admit it.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.635
Look, I told you.
There's nothing going on.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.428
Yeah, you both told me,

18:59.514 --> 19:01.223
"Lee won't cheat.
He's too noble. "

19:01.307 --> 19:02.974
Only problem is, it's
all a crock, isn't it?

19:03.059 --> 19:05.185
You know what
the only problem is?

19:05.269 --> 19:08.355
The only problem is that you
don't trust me. That's it.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.693
And this is just your own frakking
insecurities talking, same as always.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.655
I mean,
right from the get-go,

19:16.823 --> 19:19.658
the very first morning
that I proposed, I mean...

19:19.742 --> 19:23.703
You know what? Forget it.
This is frakking pointless.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.665
No. You're right.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.047
I did see this coming.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.675
And I was naive enough
to marry you, anyway.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.928
And you want
to know why, Lee?

19:42.390 --> 19:43.890
Because I loved you.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.726
I loved you
so frakking much.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.520
I thought I was lucky.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.940
That's right. Lucky.

19:53.484 --> 19:58.947
That I could have you for just as
long as you, or Kara, would let me.

20:05.580 --> 20:10.125
Dee... Come on, give me...

20:14.255 --> 20:15.964
It's not a marriage, Lee.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.051
This is a lie.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.601
You want to be with Kara?
Go ahead.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.646
I won't stand in your way.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.941
It's over.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.286
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

20:48.998 --> 20:50.165
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:54.837 --> 20:56.379
Sam...

20:58.215 --> 20:59.716
I gotta get going.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.720
This was fun.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.240
I love you.

21:52.395 --> 21:56.231
BALTAR: I'm a human being. I'm
a human being, I have rights.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.067
I said I have rights.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.862
Please, help me.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.826
I'm not sure I can, Gaius.

22:08.411 --> 22:11.246
Pain is one thing,
but this?

22:12.289 --> 22:14.708
Without free will,
what are you?

22:14.792 --> 22:16.626
Can God even pity
such a creature?

22:18.254 --> 22:21.506
Why not just admit you're doing
this for your own satisfaction?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.049
That's the truth,
isn't it?

22:23.134 --> 22:24.968
I don't know why you're not
putting the needle in yourself.

22:25.094 --> 22:30.223
COTTLE: Hold his head. Oh,
no! No! No! No! No! Oh, God!

22:44.363 --> 22:45.739
He's under.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.325
Try not to make
any loud noise.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.122
Put the head strap on.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.759
Where am I?

23:08.471 --> 23:10.388
My God, where am I?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.915
What are you saying?

23:39.502 --> 23:43.797
If I leave Sam,
will you still leave Dee?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.304
My Gods, Kara.

23:55.476 --> 23:59.312
How do I know that tomorrow you're
not going to pull another 180?

23:59.396 --> 24:02.023
I mean, these are our frakking
marriages we're talking about.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.944
It's not some stupid dogfight
we can just jink our way out of.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.283
Think about it, Lee.
That's what you're best at.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.586
Where am I?

24:26.340 --> 24:28.633
My God, where am I?

24:37.017 --> 24:40.520
ADAMA: Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear me, Doctor?

24:42.982 --> 24:46.276
Admiral, is that you?
I'm looking for you, Doctor.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.487
I can't find you. Can
you tell us where you are?

24:51.073 --> 24:52.448
It's water.

24:54.785 --> 24:59.038
I'm in the water.
It's cold and it's dark.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.505
I can't see anything!

25:07.590 --> 25:10.758
Is there anything you can see
that can tell us where you are?

25:10.843 --> 25:13.678
Look for the light. Can
you see the light? Yes!

25:13.762 --> 25:15.638
Try to reach for the light.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.267
That's it.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.686
That's it.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.107
Yes.
Follow the light.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.947
Caprica.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.366
Caprica Six.

25:37.745 --> 25:41.789
She saved my life. She
shielded me from the explosion.

25:44.752 --> 25:49.631
Doctor, did you conspire with
her to subvert our defense system?

25:50.424 --> 25:52.717
Conspiracy requires intent!

25:53.636 --> 25:55.511
I never intended.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.932
But she said deep down,
I'd always suspected.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.434
But I didn't know.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.186
How could I know?

26:04.313 --> 26:06.898
Did I conspire? Did I?

26:07.942 --> 26:09.234
No!

26:10.110 --> 26:11.361
No!

26:11.445 --> 26:13.488
I don't know. No!

26:15.866 --> 26:18.826
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault!

26:20.120 --> 26:22.330
I am not responsible!

26:22.414 --> 26:24.374
(BEEPING)

26:38.222 --> 26:39.305
She...

26:40.015 --> 26:43.184
Caprica Six, she chose me.

26:44.436 --> 26:48.690
Chose me over all men,
chosen to be seduced.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.526
Taken by the hand,

26:52.194 --> 26:54.404
guided between the light
and the dark.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.657
But is she an angel
or is she a demon?

27:00.035 --> 27:02.412
Is she imaginary
or is she real?

27:06.375 --> 27:09.043
Is she my own voice
or the voice of...

27:12.756 --> 27:15.174
I can't stay afloat
much longer!

27:16.218 --> 27:20.263
Now give us details, Doctor.
Give us details about the Cylons,

27:20.347 --> 27:22.932
or we'll let you drown.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.894
Alone, in the dark.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.784
(SCREAMS)

27:57.593 --> 27:59.093
Hey, Chief.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.597
Why is it so frakking hard?

28:06.268 --> 28:09.771
Why can't we just
get back to normal?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.565
Normal?

28:14.276 --> 28:16.277
What is normal, anyway?

28:27.414 --> 28:30.917
Now, Chief, you can tell me
if I'm out of line here,

28:31.752 --> 28:33.002
but...

28:37.257 --> 28:40.176
Do you ever think
about Sharon?

28:45.182 --> 28:46.182
No.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.770
Come on.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.233
You never wonder,
"What if?"

28:59.655 --> 29:00.655
No.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.594
No! Don't leave me! Don't
leave me! I know I'm flawed!

29:23.679 --> 29:27.223
I never claimed to be... Yes,
mistakes. Mistakes were made.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.474
Terrible mistakes!

29:28.559 --> 29:31.853
Were they mine?
Am I solely to blame?

29:32.813 --> 29:36.441
I was a player. That's all I was,
a player! I was struggling to...

29:36.525 --> 29:38.818
Struggling to find
my place in God's plan,

29:39.194 --> 29:41.195
God's resolve. I...

29:41.530 --> 29:45.199
I never intended for certain things
to happen! Doesn't that matter?

29:45.284 --> 29:47.535
You took the Cylons
to the Temple.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.205
To the Eye of Jupiter.
What did it tell them?

29:51.665 --> 29:53.499
What did it tell them
about Earth?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.418
I wasn't looking for...

29:57.004 --> 29:58.796
What were you
looking for, Doctor?

29:59.756 --> 30:01.215
What were you looking for?

30:18.859 --> 30:21.819
Their faces, but they
wouldn't show them to me.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.364
Their faces?
Whose faces?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.158
The Five.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.494
The Final Five.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.248
The Final Five? Cylons?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.418
I thought I might
be one of them.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.381
I told them I wanted
to be one of them.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.092
A Cylon. Why?

30:46.929 --> 30:48.763
All my sins forgiven.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.390
A new beginning.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.686
Are you a Cylon,
Doctor Baltar?

31:03.820 --> 31:04.946
No.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.373
That's not good enough,
Doctor. Tell me.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.667
Tell me what
you told the Cylons.

31:17.751 --> 31:21.212
What do they know? Tell me, or
I'll have to let you go, Doctor.

31:21.296 --> 31:26.050
I'll have to let you go. Tell me,
or I'll have to let you go, Doctor.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.177
I'll have to let you go.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.612
Watch where you're going.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.454
I lost my ring.

31:56.999 --> 32:00.376
Has anybody seen my ring?
I lost my ring.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.336
Has anybody seen my ring?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.175
I lost my ring!

32:20.022 --> 32:23.691
(BEEPING) Admiral! We're
losing him! That's enough.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.027
I'm putting an end to
this freak show right now.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.283
ROSLIN: Now, listen to this.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.827
"Five final Cylon models.

32:34.911 --> 32:38.956
"Five Pillars of the Temple
for the Five Priests

32:39.041 --> 32:41.542
"devoted to the One
Whose Name Cannot Be Spoken. "

32:41.627 --> 32:44.295
Come on, it's all
just mumbo-jumbo.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.631
He's holding a lot back,
Admiral. I'm sure of it.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.342
Then maybe we should resort
to more direct methods.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.761
Direct methods.
Now you have my vote.

32:51.845 --> 32:52.845
No.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.682
We've tried the stick.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.893
It's time to try the carrot.

33:01.396 --> 33:05.316
The thing he's most deeply afraid of is
that even if he talks, we'll kill him.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.734
Smart man.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.654
We have to ease his fear.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.906
Make him believe that,
if he collaborates,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.824
at the very least
he'll have his life.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.285
He won't buy that
coming from us.

33:16.453 --> 33:17.453
Of course not.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.959
We have to find
someone he trusts.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.844
As perverse
as it may seem,

33:33.929 --> 33:37.348
I may actually owe these
people a debt of gratitude.

33:49.319 --> 33:54.073
Now, I realize there's probably nothing
I can say that can make this right.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.036
But there's something
you need to know.

34:00.122 --> 34:03.624
I asked you to marry me
because I was in love with you.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.420
Just like I'm in love
with you now.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.005
They forced me.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.469
To admit my failings.

34:16.388 --> 34:20.182
And now that I have,
I feel positively liberated.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.435
You were right.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.562
I loved Kara.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.150
You know? And maybe there's
a part of me that always will.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.570
In my heart,

34:32.654 --> 34:34.864
I know I have always done

34:37.409 --> 34:39.243
what I've had to do.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.663
But I married you.

34:43.999 --> 34:45.499
I married you.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.170
And, you know, when I
look back at our marriage,

34:49.254 --> 34:52.840
at the time that
we have spent together,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.342
you are good for me, Dee.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.637
And I need you.

34:58.722 --> 35:03.309
And I don't think
I ever really realized that

35:03.393 --> 35:05.603
until I knew
that I was losing you.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.731
I can't promise you
a trial, Doctor.

35:08.815 --> 35:12.234
I am sure that if you give
them something, anything...

35:13.028 --> 35:16.447
But please just give me another
chance. That's all I'm asking.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.574
Just give me the chance.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.887
These charts that I've been
using to plot our course to Earth?

35:41.932 --> 35:45.059
I've never been confident
about my calculations.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.859
Well, that's likely because
the calculations are wrong.

35:54.528 --> 35:56.987
I detect a number of
inconsistencies right off the bat.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.406
You see, these figures
here are wrong.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.784
That's exactly
what I was afraid of.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.836
Cylon navigation systems are
far more advanced than our own,

36:11.920 --> 36:15.756
but I have managed to commit
many of the algorithms to memory.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.218
If we can offer them
this kind of help,

36:19.302 --> 36:22.471
I'm certain, at the very least,
they will spare your life.

36:22.556 --> 36:24.682
Maybe we can even
get you out of this cell,

36:24.766 --> 36:26.851
offer you
some proper quarters.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.000
Creature comforts,
that's the clincher.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.377
Sorry?

36:55.422 --> 36:56.964
Where is it?

36:59.467 --> 37:01.886
Where is what, Doctor?
"Where is what?"

37:20.447 --> 37:22.865
So much for that
little stratagem.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.327
Hello.

37:46.890 --> 37:47.890
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:48.433 --> 37:49.683
Hey...

37:50.560 --> 37:52.686
You all right?

37:52.771 --> 37:55.940
Listen, we don't have to stay
here if you don't want to, okay?

37:57.859 --> 37:59.109
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:02.530 --> 38:03.614
Yeah.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.243
Two whiskeys,
straight up.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.750
I should have known
that you would betray me.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.339
What did you tell them?

38:21.883 --> 38:24.885
That you stayed behind until the grisly
end on New Caprica so you could, what?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.929
So you could...

38:27.013 --> 38:29.932
You could feed information
to the Resistance?

38:30.517 --> 38:33.268
Who do you think
allowed you to do that?

38:33.937 --> 38:37.564
That's a lie. No, it's not
a lie. You think I'm blind?

38:38.858 --> 38:43.153
You see, I literally had
a gun pointed to my head.

38:48.410 --> 38:51.578
But nobody forced you
to play both sides.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.501
So I'm asking you,
Mr. Gaeta,

38:57.585 --> 39:00.337
who is the real traitor
in this room?

39:02.132 --> 39:03.924
To the first of many.

39:08.763 --> 39:09.930
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

39:10.015 --> 39:11.598
Let's do another.
Yeah.

39:35.582 --> 39:36.790
(LAUGHING)

39:38.626 --> 39:40.169
I am not a traitor.
No, of course.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.463
Because there are...
There are far worse things

39:42.547 --> 39:45.007
than being a traitor,
aren't there, Felix?

39:45.341 --> 39:47.885
If your friends
only knew the truth.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.305
Don't worry.
It's our little secret.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.978
We've gotta get in there.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.689
Get away from me!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.525
(SCREAMS)

40:04.527 --> 40:05.819
Frak you!

40:06.821 --> 40:10.074
GUARD: Lieutenant Gaeta. Step
away from the prisoner, now.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.495
Step away from the prisoner!
I will not ask you again!

40:14.579 --> 40:16.288
Stand down, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

40:16.372 --> 40:19.583
Step back, Mr. Gaeta.
No. No! No, sir!

40:19.667 --> 40:23.420
I can't... I can't let him
live. Not after what he's done.

40:23.505 --> 40:27.091
Mr. Gaeta? Mr. Gaeta, wait.
Please. Look at me.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.260
I understand
what you're feeling.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.596
GAETA: No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.265
The other night, you didn't come
here to interrogate Doctor Baltar.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.811
You came here to kill him, didn't
you? I understand that. I do.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.527
What's his condition? He
missed the artery. He'll live.

40:46.653 --> 40:49.530
We've got to get him to sick bay.
Get a gurney in here right away.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.406
ROSLIN: Go easy on him.

40:58.331 --> 41:02.668
NO. 6: All things considered,
Gaius, it could have been worse.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.504
Much worse.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.134
Well, you're not
one of the Five.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.886
You certainly have
the luck of the Gods.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.972
Well, I am the Chosen One.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.057
You didn't tell them that,
did you?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.394
No.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.606
Everybody's got
to have a secret.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.745
I told him I didn't take any
satisfaction in seeing his pain.

41:40.999 --> 41:46.503
But the truth is, I was willing to see
him endure a great deal of suffering

41:46.588 --> 41:48.797
in order to get
what I wanted.

41:49.966 --> 41:54.178
It wasn't some intelligence
or some truth.

41:54.888 --> 41:58.098
I wanted a genuine
admission of guilt.

42:00.268 --> 42:04.313
That's something that you're not
gonna get from someone like Baltar.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.273
He doesn't see
himself that way.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.400
That's not who he is.

42:08.484 --> 42:12.362
In his eyes,
he's the victim,

42:14.449 --> 42:16.116
not the criminal.

42:20.705 --> 42:25.334
It's not too late
for him to just disappear.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.177
We can't do that.

42:38.681 --> 42:41.183
For all his crimes,
he's one of us.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.019
So, what happens next?

42:47.982 --> 42:50.108
We give him his trial.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.833
