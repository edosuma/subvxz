WEBVTT

00:00.535 --> 00:03.285
(dramatic music)

00:04.890 --> 00:05.910
- [Narrator] Four days ago,

00:05.910 --> 00:10.598
10 ordinary people from across
the U.K. became fugitives.

00:10.598 --> 00:12.880
(people shouting)

00:12.880 --> 00:16.010
If they can stay on the run for 25 days,

00:16.010 --> 00:18.370
- [Emma] Oh my God, come on, Jess.

00:18.370 --> 00:21.203
- [Narrator] They'll win
a share of 100,000 pounds.

00:22.658 --> 00:24.030
(dramatic music)

00:24.030 --> 00:26.720
- Matthew is a Royal Marine, we believe.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.010
Very, very fit.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.160
He will revel in the
challenge of testing us.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.837
- I wanna be on top of the biggest,

00:31.837 --> 00:34.283
baddest mountain I can find in the area.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.206
- [Chief] Nick Bachelor has a total

00:36.206 --> 00:38.900
of 41 criminal convictions.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.500
- He's got an eye for danger.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.970
He knows what it looks like.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.529
- Both of them are friends
with Caroline Hogan.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.800
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.680
- [Woman] She's very distinctive.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.673
She's got bright pink hair.

00:49.673 --> 00:51.460
- I'm not going nowhere.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.430
There's no reason we need to leave here.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.653
- All units towards that location now.

00:55.653 --> 00:57.389
- I've got eyes on your back garden,

00:57.389 --> 01:00.646
and back patio doors are open.

01:00.646 --> 01:02.158
- [Caroline] Someone's been
in the field on the combine.

01:02.158 --> 01:03.019
- [Nick] What?

01:03.019 --> 01:06.918
- That's what the neighbor just said.

01:06.918 --> 01:09.077
He said there was somebody down there.

01:09.077 --> 01:11.219
He said it was a man.

01:11.219 --> 01:12.931
(gate latch clinking)

01:12.931 --> 01:15.681
(dramatic music)

01:31.363 --> 01:32.940
(dramatic music)

01:32.940 --> 01:34.590
- Possible eyes on one fugitive.

01:34.590 --> 01:35.840
Possible eyes on Nick.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.903
- Received, stand by, stand by.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.986
You got your running trainers on Steve?

01:41.986 --> 01:43.020
- [Steve] Yes, yes.

01:43.020 --> 01:43.880
- Good lad.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.713
- Eyes on Nick.

01:44.713 --> 01:48.270
I cannot see Paul, I cannot see Paul.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.721
- Received, eyes on Nick, not on Paul.

01:50.721 --> 01:53.471
(dramatic music)

01:54.600 --> 01:56.861
- [Nick] Let's go and get my binoculars.

01:56.861 --> 01:58.673
(dramatic music)

01:58.673 --> 02:00.160
- Okay, he's walking back.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.800
He's walking back towards the house.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.700
- Okay, roger that.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.272
Are you pushing in?

02:04.272 --> 02:06.022
- [Hunter] Yes, I am.

02:07.765 --> 02:09.121
(dramatic music)

02:09.121 --> 02:11.349
Stand still, stand still!

02:11.349 --> 02:12.223
- Go, go, go, go!

02:12.223 --> 02:13.540
- Into the house, into the house!

02:13.540 --> 02:15.316
Into the house, coming out the front exit,

02:15.316 --> 02:16.426
coming out the front!

02:16.426 --> 02:18.426
Don't move, stand still!

02:20.023 --> 02:22.070
(piano keys ringing)

02:22.070 --> 02:23.363
Oh, fuck!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.090
- Okay, Paul and Jill, go, go, go.

02:27.090 --> 02:28.193
George, if you're read, go, go.

02:28.193 --> 02:30.513
- Somebody's running, somebody's running.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.783
- [Hunter] He's out the front!

02:34.948 --> 02:36.388
(dramatic music)

02:36.388 --> 02:38.853
(shoes crunching)

02:38.853 --> 02:42.640
(breathing heavily)

02:42.640 --> 02:43.473
Stance down!

02:45.400 --> 02:47.170
- Oh, you bastards!

02:47.170 --> 02:49.920
- Nick Bachelor, your
time in the world is over,

02:49.920 --> 02:51.310
you've been hunted down.

02:51.310 --> 02:52.143
- Yes!

02:52.143 --> 02:54.609
(people clapping)

02:54.609 --> 02:56.613
- That's one down, one down.

02:56.613 --> 02:57.738
- One, that's one.
- All right, all right.

02:57.738 --> 02:58.571
- [Man] That's one.

02:58.571 --> 03:00.523
- We've only got one, quiet please.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.560
- Paul is still to go,
Paul is still loose.

03:05.262 --> 03:07.399
(Nick grumbling)

03:07.399 --> 03:09.080
Anybody got eyes on Paul?

03:09.080 --> 03:10.645
- Did he leave?

03:10.645 --> 03:14.040
(ominous music)

03:14.040 --> 03:15.261
- [Man On Radio] Yeah,
well, he can't be far.

03:15.261 --> 03:18.261
(piano key ringing)

03:19.677 --> 03:21.940
- All right, has he
gone rural, do we know?

03:21.940 --> 03:25.490
To the east, there's a vast
rural space to run into.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.660
- How far is that dog,
how far is that dog?

03:27.660 --> 03:29.550
- Dog's still 15 minutes away.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.150
Can we squeeze in a bit, people?

03:32.416 --> 03:34.410
The road runs northwest to southeast.

03:34.410 --> 03:35.993
Block it off.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.793
- Which way, mate?

03:40.726 --> 03:42.814
- He ran down this way, mate.

03:42.814 --> 03:43.647
- Eh?

03:43.647 --> 03:46.564
- [Man] Your guy's gone down there.

03:48.254 --> 03:50.800
- [Hunter] No eyes on
him mate, no eyes on him.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.633
- Come on.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.490
- Yeah, not so steady maybe.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.023
- Steve, any update, mate?

04:03.609 --> 04:05.037
(dramatic music)

04:05.037 --> 04:06.880
- Yeah, yeah, I got Paul, I got Paul.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.620
Paul, your time in the world is over.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.877
You have been hunted down.

04:09.877 --> 04:12.721
- Yes, get in there. (laughs)

04:12.721 --> 04:15.250
(people clapping)

04:15.250 --> 04:16.890
Well done. Stevie.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.940
- Well done, mate.
- Thank you.

04:18.940 --> 04:21.080
- Nick and Paul, well done.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.480
It was a good game, but
you weren't good enough.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.820
- Do you know what?

04:24.820 --> 04:27.563
We wouldn't change it for the world.

04:27.563 --> 04:28.950
It's been pucker.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.150
- Well done, thank you
very much, good work.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.172
(suspenseful music)

04:33.172 --> 04:34.280
- [Nick] We really, really tried to do

04:34.280 --> 04:35.980
everything we could to evade them,

04:37.810 --> 04:42.000
but being on the run years
ago, this is totally different.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.401
Constant stress.

04:43.401 --> 04:46.001
I've never, ever, ever
experienced anything like it.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.690
- [Paul Voiceover] We're
different people today.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.570
We live honest lives.

04:50.570 --> 04:52.110
I'm not trying to duck and dive,

04:52.110 --> 04:53.920
not looking over our shoulders

04:53.920 --> 04:56.123
so we're not conditioned
how we used to be.

04:57.355 --> 05:00.022
(ominous music)

05:04.120 --> 05:05.350
- [Narrator] The fugitives have been

05:05.350 --> 05:07.590
on the run for five days.

05:07.590 --> 05:11.300
With Paul and Nick captured,
the others remain at large

05:11.300 --> 05:14.200
across the length and breadth of the U.K.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.050
- Ladies and gentlemen,

05:15.050 --> 05:16.900
can we gather round the table please.

05:18.090 --> 05:19.876
Captures are great, but it's
no time to put your feet

05:19.876 --> 05:21.870
on the desk and pat yourself on the back.

05:21.870 --> 05:24.027
We've got other fugitives to catch.

05:24.027 --> 05:26.670
- [Man] Matthew Mason,
our Royal Marine soldier.

05:26.670 --> 05:28.290
- His wife is Lindsey Mason,

05:28.290 --> 05:31.620
and they've got a young son
Harry who was born August, 2017.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.210
Matthew served three tours of Afghanistan.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.140
- If anyone's gonna play
silly buggers with us,

05:36.140 --> 05:37.219
it's Matthew Mason.

05:37.219 --> 05:39.920
(dramatic music)

05:39.920 --> 05:40.753
Fucking hell.

05:40.753 --> 05:41.586
Mate, I need a hand.

05:41.586 --> 05:42.933
I need some kit, mate.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.970
Every ex-military person has
always got a hoarder kit.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.160
The hunters are probably
gonna know I wanna go rural,

05:51.160 --> 05:54.040
but I can't see many of
them walking 10 miles

05:54.040 --> 05:55.903
up a mountain range to find one man.

05:58.230 --> 05:59.390
- [Chief] Emma and Jess.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.715
- Okay, so Emma and Jess we know

06:01.715 --> 06:04.270
are linked through work, both nurses.

06:04.270 --> 06:07.730
Last location we've got
was on Burscough Bridge,

06:07.730 --> 06:10.160
so focus all efforts on
broadening out searches

06:10.160 --> 06:10.993
of this area.

06:10.993 --> 06:12.970
- Yep.
- And take it from there.

06:12.970 --> 06:13.803
- Done.

06:13.803 --> 06:16.480
(dramatic music)

06:16.480 --> 06:18.370
- Our plan is to find a car

06:18.370 --> 06:20.870
that's willing to take
us somewhere up north.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.240
Could ask the guys who work here.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.110
- [Narrator] Jess and Emma
are aiming to reach Scotland.

06:26.110 --> 06:28.943
They're trying to hitch a
lift at an industrial park.

06:30.021 --> 06:31.100
- [Man] Hiya.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.647
- Could you drive us somewhere please?

06:33.647 --> 06:34.480
- I've only got a motorbike.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.930
I can't get two of 'em on.

06:35.930 --> 06:37.680
- [Jess] What about you,
have you got a car here?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.078
- I have, but I've got to run a business.

06:39.078 --> 06:41.150
- [Jess] Yeah, but when does
it, it must close soon surely.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.067
It's five.
- It's a quarter to five.

06:42.067 --> 06:42.900
- Yeah, yeah.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.029
- [Jess] Like we can hang
around till you finish.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.190
- [Man] I probably won't
be finished till after six.

06:46.190 --> 06:47.930
- We'll go and clean up
for you or something.

06:47.930 --> 06:49.370
Do you want to wash it down with some vin?

06:49.370 --> 06:51.510
- We'll come and help you any day.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.290
Keith Dawson, Auto Repairs Limited!

06:54.290 --> 06:56.590
- [Jess] Do you not need gloves?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.940
Yep, so we're working on the run.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.790
Well, we're nurses, we're used
to wearing gloves all day.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.340
Being a nurse is very,
very, very, very stressful.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.880
- Never enough staff, never enough time

07:07.880 --> 07:09.420
to give your patients what you want

07:09.420 --> 07:11.470
'cause you also run off your feet.

07:11.470 --> 07:15.240
- But everybody knows nurses
are not nurses for the money,

07:15.240 --> 07:17.890
so it would be very helpful
if we did win the money.

07:17.890 --> 07:18.980
- Yes.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.110
I'm so bad at sweeping.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.660
- No, you're, oh, that's it, see.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.600
You are actually good for something, Emma.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.723
We've only known each other over a year,

07:27.930 --> 07:30.600
but it's been an intense
year for both of us.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.740
I've just become single,
you've just become single.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.970
- Jess saw me at my very lowest.

07:35.970 --> 07:38.470
I'd lost all my self-confidence,

07:38.470 --> 07:42.300
and she held my hand and
physically picked me up.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.993
Just, oh, it's gone up my nose.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.860
- No, you've got to still continue, Emma.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.310
I saw you really, really upset,

07:48.310 --> 07:49.662
and I thought I need to help this person.

07:49.662 --> 07:51.933
I said put some lipstick on and go out.

07:52.977 --> 07:54.700
That is a big old pile of dirt.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.550
- I know, we've done all that.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.660
Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

07:58.660 --> 07:59.493
We won't be captured, will we?

07:59.493 --> 08:01.923
- [Emma] I hope not,
we'll be absolutely fine.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.853
(dramatic music)

08:05.853 --> 08:07.420
(people chatting)

08:07.420 --> 08:08.549
- Emma and Jess are both nurses.

08:08.549 --> 08:10.030
They're both empathetic.

08:10.030 --> 08:12.470
Both of them are very people-focused.

08:12.470 --> 08:14.098
I think they operate through charm.

08:14.098 --> 08:17.150
- So they'll have no problem
talking to strangers,

08:17.150 --> 08:19.370
getting them on-site,
getting them to help them.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.210
- They're so likable that actually,

08:21.210 --> 08:22.752
even if they tell people things,

08:22.752 --> 08:25.840
I don't think we'll get that
information out of people.

08:28.670 --> 08:29.890
- Cheeky gits.

08:29.890 --> 08:34.890
Boss, an individual called
Keith Dawson 10 minutes ago

08:35.440 --> 08:38.470
tweeted a picture of Emma and Jess

08:38.470 --> 08:40.382
quoting, "Thanks for the workers."

08:40.382 --> 08:43.620
- Get that number now.
- Keith Dawson Auto Repairs.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.897
Offer him a bit of cash, you never know.

08:44.897 --> 08:46.706
(phone keys beeping)

08:46.706 --> 08:47.827
(phone ringing)

08:47.827 --> 08:50.229
- Hello.
- Hello, is that Keith?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.410
- [Keith] It is.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.363
- You posted a picture on Twitter.

08:54.391 --> 08:56.479
- [Keith] Oh, I have my new workers.

08:56.479 --> 08:59.808
- (laughs) Yes, your new workers.

08:59.808 --> 09:00.733
- [Keith] You're obviously trying

09:00.733 --> 09:02.025
to track 'em down, aren't ya?

09:02.025 --> 09:03.610
- I am indeed.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.910
I have a rather handsome reward fund

09:06.910 --> 09:08.820
in return for information.

09:08.820 --> 09:10.580
It would give me enormous pleasure

09:10.580 --> 09:12.563
to put 500 quid in your pocket.

09:16.576 --> 09:17.567
- [Keith] I'll let the girls win

09:17.567 --> 09:18.973
100 grand I think, Peter.

09:18.973 --> 09:21.260
- Keith, did they say
where they were going,

09:21.260 --> 09:23.020
what their plans were?

09:23.020 --> 09:23.853
- [Keith] They never did.

09:23.853 --> 09:25.800
They left in a basically in a big arctic.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.202
- Was that arctic sort of outside yours?

09:28.202 --> 09:29.250
- [Keith] They flagged it down,

09:29.250 --> 09:31.929
so I'm not really too
sure, mate, to be fair.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.750
- All right, Keith, thank
you for that, bye bye.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.500
Truth or nonsense?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.610
- Complete bullshit.

09:37.610 --> 09:41.060
He's definitely got CCTV
outside of his property.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.490
Hopefully, Keith has helped
them more than he's letting on.

09:43.490 --> 09:45.772
We'll get that next piece of the puzzle.

09:45.772 --> 09:47.216
(dramatic music)

09:47.216 --> 09:50.049
(letters beeping)

09:51.100 --> 09:52.040
- We'll find a nice little area

09:52.040 --> 09:53.483
to bed down for tonight.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.223
So we're traveling on foot
using map and compass.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.893
No GPS in case he can track it.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.200
I'm out of the hunters'
grasp at the minute

10:05.200 --> 10:09.843
just due to the inaccessibility
of my current location.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.460
I've been a Royal Marine for 11 years.

10:14.460 --> 10:17.230
Since joining, I've done
three tours of Afghanistan,

10:17.230 --> 10:20.271
counter-piracy narcotic
operations in the Arabian Gulf,

10:20.271 --> 10:22.633
and I've helped train foreign forces.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.940
I'm going on the run to
provide for my family,

10:27.940 --> 10:31.328
to allow my wife not to
work for another year.

10:31.328 --> 10:32.810
Boop.

10:32.810 --> 10:33.643
Boop.

10:33.643 --> 10:35.077
Take the financial pressure off,

10:35.077 --> 10:37.024
and it just gives my wife a bit more time

10:37.024 --> 10:40.023
to spend with our son, which
I think's really important.

10:40.970 --> 10:45.690
- Matt is very funny,
very challenging. (laughs)

10:45.690 --> 10:48.723
When you get to know
him, he's a big softy,

10:49.770 --> 10:51.620
but he's very determined.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.641
Whatever he sets his mind to,

10:52.641 --> 10:54.583
he's definitely gonna accomplish.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.310
- So the aim is to take back control,

10:58.310 --> 11:00.700
let the hunters know that
they're not in charge,

11:00.700 --> 11:03.258
and I just really wanna
piss 'em off. (laughs)

11:03.258 --> 11:06.008
(dramatic music)

11:07.070 --> 11:08.570
- [Man] We've now learned that Matt Mason

11:08.570 --> 11:10.730
is actually a qualified mountain leader.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.120
- [Woman] So what's a mountain leader?

11:12.120 --> 11:14.150
- Normally mountain
leader is a stepping stone

11:14.150 --> 11:15.380
to special forces.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.810
He is essentially an elite soldier.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.051
If he does get in a rural area,

11:19.051 --> 11:23.140
we're up against a very good adversary.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.470
- That's why I think his wife is key.

11:24.470 --> 11:25.590
I don't think he will make mistakes.

11:25.590 --> 11:27.663
I think she will make a mistake.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.550
- [Narrator] Ground
hunters May and Michelle

11:31.550 --> 11:36.138
have been sent to Matt's
home to question his wife.

11:36.138 --> 11:36.971
- Hello.

11:36.971 --> 11:37.820
- Hiya.
- Is it Lindsey?

11:37.820 --> 11:39.410
- Lindsey.

11:39.410 --> 11:40.269
- [Woman] We're here today to find out

11:40.269 --> 11:42.350
what we can about Matt.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.330
- If you know where he is, tell us.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.810
- No idea.

11:45.810 --> 11:47.900
- So he didn't brief you
about what he was gonna do,

11:47.900 --> 11:48.990
where he was gonna go?

11:48.990 --> 11:49.823
- Not at all.
(baby blowing)

11:49.823 --> 11:50.656
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a look

11:50.656 --> 11:51.598
around the house.

11:51.598 --> 11:54.889
(dramatic music)

11:54.889 --> 11:55.890
- [Woman] Oh my god.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.610
Whose phone is this?

11:57.610 --> 11:59.350
- That'll be Matt's 'cause
he's forever losing his phone

11:59.350 --> 12:01.490
and he'll have just picked up a cheap one,

12:01.490 --> 12:03.230
and then got a better one at another time.

12:03.230 --> 12:04.380
- [Woman] And how many
phones has he bought

12:04.380 --> 12:05.304
before he went away?

12:05.304 --> 12:06.730
- He's not bought any.

12:06.730 --> 12:09.010
Don't change them, he hasn't bought any.

12:09.010 --> 12:10.473
- An external hard drive.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.242
Has that got enough data on it?

12:12.242 --> 12:13.840
- No idea.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.430
- One hard drive, one phone.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.915
- Yep, we're taking 'em.

12:16.915 --> 12:19.665
(dramatic music)

12:23.301 --> 12:25.880
- We've got Matt Mason's kit,

12:25.880 --> 12:27.780
what they've recovered from his house.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.750
- [Matt] How much is Bear Gryll's worth?

12:32.750 --> 12:35.020
- He's been searching using his own voice.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.223
- [Matt] Peppa Pig.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.570
- [Narrator] Cyber have
accessed Matt's Google account

12:39.570 --> 12:42.057
and downloaded his voice search history.

12:42.057 --> 12:44.730
- He has no idea this stuff's
being recorded, right?

12:44.730 --> 12:47.969
- He is not technologically savvy at all.

12:47.969 --> 12:50.369
- [Matt] Land for sale
for under 100,000 pounds.

12:51.856 --> 12:54.560
- He's already spending the prize money.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.393
- [Woman] He's won it, in his head,

12:55.393 --> 12:57.080
He's already won.
- Yep.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.960
- He's done tons of searches
for locations and weather,

13:00.960 --> 13:03.910
some very specific directions.

13:03.910 --> 13:04.950
- Before he went on the run?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.474
- Yep, just before he went on the run,

13:06.474 --> 13:08.690
and most things head to Wales.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.520
You know, for him to search
the weather on Snowdonia,

13:10.520 --> 13:12.610
we know he's a mountain leader.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.720
We know that he's comfortable
in that environment.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.190
I'm convinced he's in Wales, convinced.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.023
(dramatic music)

13:19.023 --> 13:20.630
(letters beeping)

13:20.630 --> 13:23.380
(Matt whistling)

13:25.890 --> 13:28.623
- I can't see Peter
bicycling on his immoframe

13:28.623 --> 13:31.926
coming up here. (laughs)

13:31.926 --> 13:34.676
(dramatic music)

13:35.582 --> 13:38.332
(dramatic music)

13:42.397 --> 13:46.050
(people chatting)

13:46.050 --> 13:46.883
- [Steve] Julie?

13:46.883 --> 13:48.190
- Yeah.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.520
- [Narrator] Steve has been
analyzing the information

13:50.520 --> 13:52.293
on Matt Mason's devices.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.750
- So we've got those postal
codes he searched for,

13:55.750 --> 13:59.593
his Google Map history, his
Google location searches.

14:00.522 --> 14:02.450
He's looking at everything on the map.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.580
This does look like a route.
- Oh, really?

14:04.580 --> 14:05.830
- Look at this.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.110
- [Narrator] Matt's search
history appears to show

14:09.110 --> 14:12.203
a route through Wales
via the Brecon Beacons.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.240
- In classic military style,

14:14.240 --> 14:17.280
he's done all of his
pre-planning, prepped his route,

14:17.280 --> 14:18.810
and then he just drops off the radar.

14:18.810 --> 14:19.800
- First, if we've got this information,

14:19.800 --> 14:22.320
we're just looking at the amount of map,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.955
tracing his route, we
just go and intercept it.

14:24.955 --> 14:27.520
- Oh, that would be fantastic.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.480
- We get the start point of his journey.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.543
We can work out the distance,

14:30.543 --> 14:32.550
and we can work out roughly

14:32.550 --> 14:34.270
where he'll be now.
- Yeah, time and distance.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.150
- Yeah.

14:35.150 --> 14:36.643
He's doing it, great.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.520
(water gurgling)

14:39.520 --> 14:42.400
- Being up here, I know 100% that they've

14:42.400 --> 14:43.493
no idea where I am.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.660
Off the grid completely,

14:46.660 --> 14:49.700
so think I might send 'em a little teaser.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.410
Let the hunters know that I can do that.

14:51.410 --> 14:55.250
I can go anywhere I want
and survive and operate.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.750
- [Narrator] Matt has a
plan to taunt the hunters.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.960
- [Matt] Since I was
only carrying limited kit

15:00.960 --> 15:04.676
so I'm gonna have to use
this to dry myself. (laughs)

15:04.676 --> 15:09.676
(playful music)
(water gurgling)

15:10.403 --> 15:12.943
Gotta fuel the fire,
mate, gotta fuel the fire.

15:15.198 --> 15:17.113
Hiya, just out fishing.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.013
How you doing, mate?

15:20.013 --> 15:21.433
I'm wondering if you're
able to send that please?

15:21.433 --> 15:22.311
- Yeah sure, sir.

15:22.311 --> 15:24.473
For the purpose of safety,
what's inside, sir?

15:24.473 --> 15:25.306
- A T-shirt.

15:26.890 --> 15:27.960
As soon as they get the mail

15:27.960 --> 15:30.500
and realize that I've
sent it from Betws-y-Coed,

15:30.500 --> 15:33.120
I'll be 150 miles south.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.373
It's tactically sound.

15:37.170 --> 15:42.079
(dramatic music)
(letters beeping)

15:42.079 --> 15:44.680
- [Jess] (yawns) Morning.

15:44.680 --> 15:45.620
- [Emma] Well, we slept well.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.200
- I think I slept like eight hours.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.580
I wish I could do this dance.

15:49.580 --> 15:50.630
- What, flossing?

15:50.630 --> 15:51.463
- Is that what it's called?

15:51.463 --> 15:52.600
- Yeah, I didn't know this the other day.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.490
Someone said to me can you
floss, and I was like, excuse me?

15:55.490 --> 15:56.847
- Is that what that means?
- Yes!

15:56.847 --> 15:58.713
- Oh my god, I literally
thought people meant you liked

15:58.713 --> 15:59.546
to watch me floss.
- And then I got told

15:59.546 --> 16:00.850
I was a posh twat.

16:00.850 --> 16:04.713
- I genuinely thought someone
was asking to watch me floss.

16:05.910 --> 16:07.300
- I've chosen to ruck
out on the run with Jess

16:07.300 --> 16:09.380
because she's brought
out the best side of me

16:09.380 --> 16:11.630
this past year since I've known her.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.400
I think I'm a very unconfident person.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.590
Jess is someone who
really helps with that.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.230
She says to me, "You can do this."

16:19.230 --> 16:21.517
- Emma just needs to chill
her beans, don't you?

16:21.517 --> 16:24.429
(pan clanking)

16:24.429 --> 16:25.658
You do.

16:25.658 --> 16:28.010
- [Interviewer] Who'd you
let play more of the leader?

16:28.010 --> 16:29.537
- I think me.

16:29.537 --> 16:30.920
I'm quite bossy.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.400
I think I'll say right, Emma,

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
we're doing this, we're doing that.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.110
I think you'll be more
the nurturing mother,

16:36.110 --> 16:38.530
so I think she'll be the
one cooking, won't you?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.200
- I'll try. (laughs)

16:40.200 --> 16:41.720
- She's a good cook.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.583
I hate cooking.

16:45.391 --> 16:47.500
We've just have to put
our thumb up, Emma, Emma.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.620
Put your thumb up, like properly.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.290
- Jess, we can't, is that a walkway?

16:52.290 --> 16:53.690
- [Jess] It's fine, come on.

16:55.270 --> 16:56.440
- [Narrator] Jess and Emma are trying

16:56.440 --> 16:59.966
to get to Penrith Station
to catch a train to Glasgow.

16:59.966 --> 17:01.026
(car engines revving)

17:01.026 --> 17:02.359
- [Jess] Please.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.123
You're not sticking your thumb out.

17:05.123 --> 17:07.520
- [Emma] I've literally
I've just put it in.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.353
- 'Cause you got like really.
- I did, I have.

17:08.353 --> 17:10.200
- You got to put your
hand into it, come on.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.092
- Jess, my arm is out.

17:11.092 --> 17:13.542
- [Jess] No, but it's like
not out strong enough.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.911
- [Emma] I'm wondering
if you could help us.

17:18.911 --> 17:20.424
- [Jess] Can we get a lift?

17:20.424 --> 17:21.257
Please helps us.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.740
- Yes, all right.
- Is that okay?

17:22.740 --> 17:23.573
- [Narrator] Once in Scotland,

17:23.573 --> 17:27.173
they have plans to make contact
with an old family friend.

17:28.570 --> 17:30.150
- [Jess] Thank you so much, Anna.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.374
There's always a risk
that they will catch on

17:31.374 --> 17:33.170
to where we are and what we're doing,

17:33.170 --> 17:35.110
so we're very anxious to see whether,

17:35.110 --> 17:37.860
I don't know whether we
covered our tracks well enough.

17:39.727 --> 17:40.930
(dramatic music)

17:40.930 --> 17:44.480
- Look at Jess in that picture,
right, front and center.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.423
She likes to pose.

17:46.910 --> 17:50.900
- Emma and Jess, they are such
completely different people.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.402
Emma needs approval and she needs love.

17:53.402 --> 17:55.360
Jess doesn't actually need that.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.170
She needs attention and adoration,

17:58.170 --> 18:00.279
actually quite different psychologically.

18:00.279 --> 18:04.183
So really radically different individuals,

18:05.310 --> 18:07.530
and the question is as the tensions build

18:07.530 --> 18:08.920
and the pressures build,

18:08.920 --> 18:13.530
how will these two young
girls cope together?

18:13.530 --> 18:18.020
- We've got CCTV from Keith
Dawson Auto Repairs at 6:32.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.170
This is in relation to the two girls.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.310
- CCTV?

18:21.310 --> 18:25.100
- [Man] It shows a white Land
Rover, Keith Dawson's vehicle.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.680
- We knew he was lying.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.570
So they got in his vehicle.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.170
Track his vehicle and his phone.

18:31.260 --> 18:32.970
- [Narrator] Using cell site analysis,

18:32.970 --> 18:35.570
HQ tracks Keith Dawson's mobile phone

18:35.570 --> 18:37.373
to the edge of the Lake District.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.890
- So that's our triangulation there.

18:39.890 --> 18:43.970
Very little in that space apart
from the caravan camp site.

18:43.970 --> 18:46.940
Kind of obvious bed-down location.

18:46.940 --> 18:49.250
So we've tracked Keith
Dawson's handset and vehicle

18:49.250 --> 18:50.630
to a camp site in Kendal.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.760
We're honing in on CCTV in
and around the camp site

18:53.760 --> 18:55.530
and broadening that out further.

18:55.530 --> 18:58.280
(dramatic music)

19:00.302 --> 19:01.135
- Do you know what?

19:01.135 --> 19:02.272
I'm ashamed to say I've never
been to Scotland either.

19:02.272 --> 19:03.105
- Me either.

19:03.105 --> 19:04.467
- Have you not?
- No.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.909
That's Penrith Station.

19:05.909 --> 19:07.510
- I'm getting really
anxious, I don't know why.

19:07.510 --> 19:08.973
It's the first time I've been anxious.

19:10.602 --> 19:12.150
- [Emma] This will either
be the best decision

19:12.150 --> 19:14.073
we've done so far or the worst.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.850
- [Narrator] Before boarding the train,

19:16.850 --> 19:20.253
the girls devise a strategy
to try and avoid detection.

19:21.147 --> 19:23.169
- Okay, this is not.

19:23.169 --> 19:24.002
(laughs)

19:24.002 --> 19:25.267
Look at my.

19:25.267 --> 19:26.443
Look at my eyebrows.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.851
I've never felt so weird in all my life.

19:30.851 --> 19:31.894
God.

19:31.894 --> 19:34.033
(dryer blowing)
(shouting)

19:34.033 --> 19:35.263
Oh my gosh!

19:35.263 --> 19:36.546
Is it too obvious?

19:36.546 --> 19:37.796
- I don't know.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.070
Remember, we don't know each other.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.430
- [Narrator] Jess has instructed Emma

19:45.430 --> 19:48.453
that they must travel separately,
without communicating.

19:49.727 --> 19:51.727
- Making it look like I don't know Jess.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.023
So stressed.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.630
(dramatic music)

19:58.630 --> 19:59.860
- Steve?

19:59.860 --> 20:03.360
Confirmed sighting of Emma and Jess.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.821
- [Woman] She's asking
that person directions.

20:06.821 --> 20:08.520
- Oh, their police.
- She's not happy about that.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.820
- [Narrator] After sweeping
CCTV close to the campsite,

20:11.820 --> 20:14.220
HQ have spotted the girls.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.000
- Maybe she's agreed to give 'em a ride.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.550
- [Steve] Enhance that and
then track that vehicle.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.350
- [Woman] We have ANPR coordinates.

20:23.350 --> 20:24.250
- Where did it go?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.153
Penrith.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.053
Oh, it's obvious it's that train station.

20:28.053 --> 20:29.663
- Train station.
- Yeah.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.570
They definitely got CCTV--
- Penrith could ring

20:31.570 --> 20:32.470
the train station.

20:39.592 --> 20:42.427
- Look, we are putting
ourselves at risk here,

20:42.427 --> 20:45.400
but it could give us big reward
if we get through with it,

20:45.400 --> 20:47.170
and get away with it.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.552
- I'm not going to communicate with her.

20:55.552 --> 20:59.580
I suddenly feel vulnerable,
really vulnerable.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.700
There's always cameras on trains

21:02.700 --> 21:04.283
and any public transport.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.310
And they could be waiting
for us at Glasgow.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.560
I feel like maybe we
need to change our plan.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.660
- [Narrator] The girls have
agreed to travel separately

21:13.660 --> 21:16.793
to meet Emma's contact at
Glasgow Botanic Gardens.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.360
- I need to get a note to Jess.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.140
I've written her a note.

21:27.490 --> 21:30.560
Excuse me, I have a weird question.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.040
My friend is in the next carriage

21:33.040 --> 21:35.820
and she's got a brown wig on with glasses.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.170
Can you give her this?

21:37.170 --> 21:38.003
Thank you.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.270
Literally says when we
get off I'll follow you

21:46.270 --> 21:47.520
until you tell me not to.

21:53.082 --> 21:54.320
- (chuckles) What the?

21:54.320 --> 21:57.002
They look ridiculous.
- Bright green rucksack.

21:57.002 --> 21:58.496
- What are they doing?

21:58.496 --> 22:00.100
- They look like the people at Scooby Doo.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.117
(laughing)

22:01.117 --> 22:02.030
They do.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.070
- Is it Daphne and Wilma?

22:03.070 --> 22:04.450
Good, they're easier to track now

22:04.450 --> 22:06.050
because they look more obvious.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.290
- They've not got a criminal background.

22:07.290 --> 22:08.610
They don't know about blending in

22:08.610 --> 22:09.848
and just disappearing.

22:09.848 --> 22:11.680
I think they've just been really stupid.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.331
- [Man] We have them on Platform Two.

22:13.331 --> 22:15.407
- So the next train from
the platform leaves 11:49

22:15.407 --> 22:18.160
- To Glasgow.
- That's the train then.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.697
Scotland.

22:19.697 --> 22:21.864
(beeping)

22:25.013 --> 22:26.001
- The main goal right now is just

22:26.001 --> 22:29.480
to kind of follow Jess incognito.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.500
- [Narrator] Emma hasn't
stuck to Jess's plan

22:31.500 --> 22:32.813
to travel separately.

22:33.898 --> 22:35.693
- This isn't really fair.

22:35.693 --> 22:36.840
It's putting the responsibility on to me

22:36.840 --> 22:38.694
and I don't know where I'm going.

22:38.694 --> 22:39.620
Fuck's sake.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.480
She's... (sighs)

22:41.480 --> 22:43.930
She's worried about
getting caught but so am I.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.280
But by making her follow me I'm probably

22:45.280 --> 22:47.560
gonna be the one that gets caught.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.813
So I'm gonna have a right,
fucking go at her later.

22:51.062 --> 22:53.812
(dramatic music)

22:57.115 --> 22:58.280
I'm not very happy, mate.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.270
- I don't understand why.

22:59.270 --> 23:00.317
- Because you're making go first

23:00.317 --> 23:01.880
so if I get caught and you don't.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.990
- No, not at all.
- Yes, you are.

23:02.990 --> 23:03.823
- I don't understand

23:03.823 --> 23:04.930
why you thought that.
- I don't know Glasgow.

23:04.930 --> 23:05.763
I've never fucking been here in my life.

23:05.763 --> 23:06.913
- Nor have I.
- Don't treat me like

23:06.913 --> 23:08.060
a fucking mug 'cause I'm not.

23:08.060 --> 23:10.160
- Jess, I don't understand.
- I'm that close to going

23:10.160 --> 23:11.467
on my own now.
- But I understand why?

23:11.467 --> 23:13.230
- 'Cause you're making me go first.

23:13.230 --> 23:14.100
We never agreed on that.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.784
You sent me a shitty
little note on the train.

23:15.784 --> 23:17.680
Why did you do that, why?

23:17.680 --> 23:18.513
- Do you wanna know why?

23:18.513 --> 23:19.371
Because I didn't know
where I was going either.

23:19.371 --> 23:20.310
- I don't know either!
- I thought that you did.

23:20.310 --> 23:22.180
- Use your fucking brain, Emma!

23:22.180 --> 23:23.210
- Don't talk to me like that, Jess.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.330
Don't treat me

23:24.330 --> 23:25.198
like I'm this big.
- Right, give me my stuff.

23:25.198 --> 23:26.120
I'm going.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.815
- Oh, come on, mate.
- No, I'm fucking off.

23:28.815 --> 23:29.870
(sad music)

23:29.870 --> 23:33.300
- I honestly did that
out of just pure fear

23:33.300 --> 23:34.730
and Jess clearly doesn't know me

23:34.730 --> 23:36.280
as well as she thought she did.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.733
She's got no numbers, nothing.

23:40.733 --> 23:42.233
I've got them all.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.300
- Oh, fuck's sake.

23:49.300 --> 23:52.597
She's got all my fucking
numbers, she's got my numbers.

23:54.150 --> 23:56.452
Actually, Emma, Emma.

23:56.452 --> 23:58.700
Stop being a scared little
girl and let's do this.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.780
- [Emma] Yeah, okay, I want to do this.

24:01.780 --> 24:03.230
I'd like to do this together.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.460
I'm sorry I panicked.

24:08.460 --> 24:10.550
- I don't do well with that.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.670
- All I can do is say I'm
sorry and I've made a mistake,

24:12.670 --> 24:13.570
and I know I have.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.810
- [Jess] I'm sorry, we're
both feeling the pressure.

24:17.810 --> 24:19.783
I am incredibly stressed and anxious.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.380
- Chief.
- Yeah?

24:28.380 --> 24:30.733
- We've received post from Matt Mason.

24:35.155 --> 24:39.100
- Dear Peter, I do hope
you like the T-shirt.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.330
- Smells bad, doesn't it?

24:40.330 --> 24:41.695
- [Man] Oh, it stinks.

24:41.695 --> 24:43.850
Oh, fuck's sake.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.683
- [Woman] It's got Peter's picture,

24:44.683 --> 24:46.640
and it's "Catch me if you can."

24:46.640 --> 24:49.860
- It's futile beyond compare.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.703
It's not worthy of comment.

24:52.780 --> 24:55.430
- They'll be a stamp on the
envelope, wouldn't there?

24:56.420 --> 24:57.810
- I think he thinks he's better than us.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.350
I think he's probably so full of glee

24:59.350 --> 25:01.580
and so pleased with himself
for coming up with that

25:01.580 --> 25:03.910
that he may not even
be thinking about this,

25:03.910 --> 25:05.921
and may not be aware of
all the other information

25:05.921 --> 25:07.290
we already have.

25:07.290 --> 25:09.080
- We've got the location of where he

25:09.080 --> 25:11.940
mailed his disgusting shirt from.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.330
Gwynedd.

25:13.330 --> 25:14.843
- Yes, it's on his list.

25:15.760 --> 25:16.593
- [Woman] It is on his list.

25:16.593 --> 25:18.810
- Right, we're on this then.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.050
- [Narrator] The post office is in one

25:20.050 --> 25:23.860
of the search locations on
Matt's confiscated phone.

25:23.860 --> 25:27.013
- Guys, we've got CCTV
from the post office.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.055
(people chattering)

25:29.055 --> 25:30.177
- [Woman] There he goes.

25:30.177 --> 25:31.010
- Yes!

25:32.035 --> 25:33.028
That's him.

25:33.028 --> 25:34.660
- Okay, this is brilliant.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.720
This ties it all together.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.720
So on the 10th he was
googling weather in Snowdonia.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.300
15th, he's there on the edge of Snowdonia.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.590
We're not chasing a tail.

25:44.590 --> 25:47.500
We've potentially got the
root, the head of him doing it.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.333
We've got his plan.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.154
- I have always been deeply suspicious

25:50.154 --> 25:54.020
of people that exercise their
biceps more than their brains.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.143
His capture will be ours to enjoy.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.020
- I've got contacts in the south.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.821
Certainly I want to get down south ASAP.

26:03.821 --> 26:06.610
I do need a resupply of rations

26:06.610 --> 26:10.333
so I could head back out and
be completely self-sustained.

26:11.330 --> 26:13.123
Plan is to jump on a bus.

26:13.123 --> 26:14.690
Get to Abergavenny.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.603
Keep moving, try and stay one
step ahead of the hunters.

26:21.470 --> 26:22.530
- [Narrator] Matt's planning to resupply

26:22.530 --> 26:24.613
with a contact in Abergavenny.

26:25.700 --> 26:28.000
He's heading southeast
through the Brecon Becons

26:28.000 --> 26:28.833
to get there.

26:31.650 --> 26:33.100
After 10 days off grid,

26:33.100 --> 26:35.573
it means going into town to catch a bus.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.507
It's just the vulnerability
of being on a bus,

26:39.507 --> 26:43.944
which has obviously
added elements of stress.

26:43.944 --> 26:46.361
Puts uncertainty in the plan.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.585
- This data, it's just gold.

26:53.585 --> 26:56.343
All coming together,
pointing to Brecon Beacons.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.112
- [Narrator] HQ are
planning to intercept Matt

26:59.112 --> 27:01.923
at the next southerly town on his route.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.600
- Abergavenny was found
on his own handset.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.433
- Yeah.
- Yep.

27:06.433 --> 27:07.266
Which he will not have--

27:07.266 --> 27:08.290
- [Man] Which he will not have hit yet.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.290
- [Woman] Oh my God.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.460
- We suspect that he's
headed south in Wales.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.520
Generally towards Abergavenny.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.080
- He has no idea that
we know about his route.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.723
We're never gonna get behind
this bloke to catch him.

27:21.723 --> 27:22.920
We need to get in front of him

27:22.920 --> 27:24.790
with all the intelligence
and take him out.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.781
- I've got a pair of
underpants for Matt Mason now.

27:26.781 --> 27:28.084
I've not washed it in six months.

27:28.084 --> 27:30.334
(laughing)

27:35.327 --> 27:38.077
(dramatic music)

27:40.840 --> 27:43.447
- Abergavenny is bang on what we thought.

27:43.447 --> 27:46.400
But how are we gonna get
the signal that he's there?

27:46.400 --> 27:48.958
- [Narrator] HQ suspect that
Matt Mason is heading south

27:48.958 --> 27:51.723
through the Brecon Beacons to Abergavenny.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.654
- I'm wondering whether we just recruit

27:53.654 --> 27:54.719
some eyes on the ground.

27:54.719 --> 27:56.660
- Yes.
- Short is Purvis

27:56.660 --> 27:59.910
reporting back if they see Matt Mason?

27:59.910 --> 28:01.264
- What's awesome about urban areas is

28:01.264 --> 28:03.970
he can't stop one of
the 100 people you come

28:03.970 --> 28:06.550
into contact with taking a
picture hashtagging on to it.

28:06.550 --> 28:08.007
- As we've seen with
some of the others, yeah.

28:08.007 --> 28:09.960
- And that's where he's gonna show out.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.793
- I like this.

28:15.055 --> 28:16.910
(beeping)

28:16.910 --> 28:18.950
- There's only one bus
that goes to Abergavenny.

28:18.950 --> 28:21.663
The bus is two hours and 25 minutes away.

28:23.010 --> 28:26.730
Waiting around like this makes
me feel pretty vulnerable.

28:26.730 --> 28:29.143
I'm very aware that
there's a lot of CCTV so.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.455
I'm not to into the rain.

28:32.455 --> 28:34.450
Everyone's got their rugs up.

28:34.450 --> 28:37.364
Avoiding CCTV is obviously very difficult,

28:37.364 --> 28:41.833
but hats, hoods, using umbrellas
will be quite important.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.570
- [Narrator] Fugitive
Matt is trying to get

28:44.570 --> 28:47.653
to Abergavenny in 24 hours to resupply.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.753
- Just trying to work out
what the best move is.

28:54.130 --> 28:57.190
Do you know anybody going
to Abergavenny tonight?

28:57.190 --> 28:59.276
If you know anyone driving down?

28:59.276 --> 29:00.924
I could perhaps jump in with them.

29:00.924 --> 29:01.757
- Gosh no.

29:05.743 --> 29:08.053
- It's just a thought,
just a thought, that's all.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.300
I'm just trying to get on the road.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.957
Maybe I might even stick my thumb out

29:13.957 --> 29:17.124
for 20 minutes, see what comes my way.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.014
Fucking hell.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.430
You can be on the side of a road for hours

29:27.430 --> 29:28.860
waiting for a hitch hike.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.230
We need to push on to an area

29:30.230 --> 29:31.940
that we can potentially jump on that bus

29:31.940 --> 29:33.540
that's leaving Builth Wells now.

29:34.500 --> 29:38.223
This is the only bus to
Abergavenny all week.

29:39.338 --> 29:40.838
I have to risk it.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.680
- Ah, there's a chap here.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.693
He is saying he might
have some information.

29:47.693 --> 29:49.728
(beeping)

29:49.728 --> 29:51.155
(phone ringing)

29:51.155 --> 29:51.995
- [Man] Hello?

29:51.995 --> 29:54.065
- Hello, what is it you
think that you've seen?

29:54.065 --> 29:56.007
- [Man] A suspicious
person's come into the pub

29:56.007 --> 29:58.933
that I work in.
- What pub was this?

29:58.933 --> 30:01.953
- [Man] The White Horse in Builth Wells.

30:01.953 --> 30:03.160
- Can we map that out?

30:03.160 --> 30:05.051
Get the map up.
- The White Horse.

30:05.051 --> 30:06.343
- [Woman] Oh, it's just north
of Abergavenny, isn't it?

30:07.670 --> 30:10.090
- I'm gonna send you a
picture now of the fugitive.

30:10.090 --> 30:13.223
If you could confirm yes
or no that would be great.

30:13.223 --> 30:14.433
- [Man] 100% him.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.450
- Yes, 100% right.
- 100% him.

30:16.450 --> 30:17.817
- He thinks it's 100% him.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.700
- Yes
- Right, brilliant.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.900
What were they talking about?

30:20.900 --> 30:23.581
- [Man] He just asked one of the bar staff

30:23.581 --> 30:25.748
for a lift to Abergavenny.

30:26.687 --> 30:28.740
- Okay, and what did the barman say?

30:28.740 --> 30:30.856
- [Man] She said that she couldn't.

30:30.856 --> 30:33.515
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

30:33.515 --> 30:34.650
- Excellent.

30:34.650 --> 30:35.483
- He doesn't know we're there.

30:35.483 --> 30:37.300
He doesn't know we're ahead of him.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.550
- Right, stand by, call going
into the ground hunters.

30:39.550 --> 30:40.383
Right, how we getting on?

30:40.383 --> 30:41.711
We're all present and ready and correct?

30:41.711 --> 30:42.544
- Yes.
- Yeah.

30:42.544 --> 30:45.480
- About 15 minutes ago,
Matthew Mason left the pub

30:45.480 --> 30:47.489
towards your location as we speak.

30:47.489 --> 30:48.513
The problem being is,

30:48.513 --> 30:51.410
Matthew Mason is a Royal
Marine mountain leader.

30:51.410 --> 30:52.941
Quite frankly, I don't think anyone

30:52.941 --> 30:55.740
out of our entire hunter team
would beat him on a foot race.

30:55.740 --> 30:57.507
We wanna contain him and surround him

30:57.507 --> 31:00.400
and then squeeze him in so
he's got nowhere to run.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.620
We are deploying the canines.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.522
We'll have three ground
hunter teams, the drones,

31:04.522 --> 31:06.737
so we'll have as much as we possibly can.

31:06.737 --> 31:09.237
I think we could have him
in the bag today, girls.

31:10.734 --> 31:13.650
(thrilling music)

31:13.650 --> 31:14.950
- I'm psyched, man.

31:14.950 --> 31:17.833
I really, really, really wanna catch him.

31:17.833 --> 31:20.633
- Get the drone deployed
straightaway, get the drone up.

31:21.638 --> 31:24.138
(dog barking)

31:25.840 --> 31:27.340
- Right, we sit and wait here.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.587
- [Narrator] Three hunter
teams are strategically placed

31:31.587 --> 31:34.183
on arterial routes into Abergavenny.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.491
- Come on.

31:36.491 --> 31:37.674
(breathing deeply)

31:37.674 --> 31:39.940
Worst but best bit, this
is, worst but best bit.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.143
I fucking love this bit.

31:42.653 --> 31:44.233
- That bus is due any minute.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.816
If the hunters pull
in, I'm going that way.

31:52.816 --> 31:55.260
All right, straight across the
river, straight up the hill.

31:55.260 --> 31:58.013
Oh, here we go. (whistling)

31:59.360 --> 32:00.193
Come on.

32:04.630 --> 32:06.132
Hey, mate, you're going
to Abergavenny, yeah?

32:06.132 --> 32:06.965
- [Driver] Yeah.

32:06.965 --> 32:08.142
- Ah, mate, one to Abergavenny.

32:08.142 --> 32:09.809
Thank you very much.

32:12.552 --> 32:15.552
- [Man] Main turning up on the road.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.940
- If he sees us, he is gonna bolt.

32:25.940 --> 32:27.530
There is 100K on the line here.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.163
He is not gonna wait around.

32:30.311 --> 32:33.545
- My thinking is is, am
I safe now, am I safe?

32:33.545 --> 32:35.033
Am I getting followed?

32:38.445 --> 32:40.695
(whispers)

32:43.380 --> 32:46.883
- We've got live feed here in HQ, standby.

32:48.170 --> 32:49.810
- We're literally sitting
right on top of him.

32:49.810 --> 32:51.041
- Hopefully he's unaware of our presence

32:51.041 --> 32:52.550
and we squeeze him.

32:52.550 --> 32:53.503
- Oblivious.

32:57.310 --> 32:59.355
- Pretty dodgy feeling.

32:59.355 --> 33:02.770
I think I made a mistake.

33:02.770 --> 33:05.120
Because I have spoken to
members of the public.

33:06.270 --> 33:10.843
I think I need to completely
reassess what's going on.

33:12.271 --> 33:14.333
How to get to where I wanna be.

33:16.465 --> 33:17.600
- Is there any movement?

33:17.600 --> 33:20.110
- [Man] Negative, no movements
at all at the moment.

33:20.110 --> 33:21.890
- No sightings, roger that.

33:21.890 --> 33:22.794
- If we don't catch him here,

33:22.794 --> 33:25.070
we probably won't see him
again till the extraction day.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.433
- We need to get him now.

33:31.811 --> 33:34.453
- Feeling so out of
control, so vulnerable.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.033
Gonna get off.

33:39.132 --> 33:40.380
Would I be able to get
dropped off here actually?

33:40.380 --> 33:41.733
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

33:45.358 --> 33:46.494
- I've just got a real gut feeling

33:46.494 --> 33:48.210
that these hunters are on my ass

33:48.210 --> 33:50.273
because I've spoken to people en route.

33:54.022 --> 33:56.410
- [Man] There's no movement
whatsoever, team, over.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.190
- Time and distance, if he did get a lift

33:58.190 --> 34:00.660
we would assume he would have been there

34:00.660 --> 34:01.830
probably 20 minutes ago,

34:01.830 --> 34:03.510
but nothing to say he
was dropped off early

34:03.510 --> 34:05.980
and he's gonna walk the
rest of the route in.

34:05.980 --> 34:06.990
- Fucking hell!

34:08.280 --> 34:12.140
- Can somebody tell me
where Matt Mason is?

34:12.140 --> 34:15.285
We have ground hunters all over the show.

34:15.285 --> 34:18.830
Dog, drone, the lot.

34:18.830 --> 34:19.803
Where is he?

34:24.673 --> 34:26.209
(panting)

34:26.209 --> 34:27.140
- I'm pretty stressed.

34:27.140 --> 34:28.770
I'm thinking, right, they've
got me, they've got me penned,

34:28.770 --> 34:30.020
they've got me penned in.

34:31.720 --> 34:34.724
Disappear, get off grid completely

34:34.724 --> 34:39.410
and then maybe resurface
tomorrow 10-15 miles

34:39.410 --> 34:40.573
out of this area.

34:42.870 --> 34:45.620
(dramatic music)

34:47.940 --> 34:49.450
- We are, to be quite frank,

34:49.450 --> 34:51.750
falling quite behind with Emma and Jess.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.980
Train station, off at Glasgow,

34:53.980 --> 34:57.660
from Glasgow we've battened
the CCTV, walking northwest.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.530
- We've seen them walking this
way and then we lose them.

35:00.530 --> 35:01.903
Checking CCTV up here.

35:03.010 --> 35:05.296
- They come on the camera,
they go off the camera.

35:05.296 --> 35:06.470
What's next to it?

35:06.470 --> 35:07.510
Botanical Gardens.

35:07.510 --> 35:10.642
Do that as a matter of
urgency, if that's okay.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.809
(beeping)

35:14.820 --> 35:17.120
- Oh, I've got a new bloody
spot this morning, haven't I?

35:17.120 --> 35:18.870
- [Jess] It's fucking stress, Emma.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.020
I was so stressed yesterday.

35:22.020 --> 35:22.853
- [Emma] Yeah.

35:22.853 --> 35:23.830
We wet ourselves.

35:23.830 --> 35:27.910
- Sometimes it's good to get
an argument out, isn't it?

35:27.910 --> 35:28.994
- Yeah, get things off your chest.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.593
- Yeah, yeah.
- Definitely.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.233
Wicked.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.640
- I'm sorry, we just need
to be better to each other.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.630
- [Emma] Yeah, we do.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.230
- We need to look after each other.

35:39.230 --> 35:40.560
- Yes, we do.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.200
- [Narrator] Emma and
Jess have been picked up

35:42.200 --> 35:43.690
from the Botanic Gardens

35:43.690 --> 35:45.900
and are staying with their contact,

35:45.900 --> 35:48.830
ex-Marine Grenville Botham.

35:48.830 --> 35:53.490
- I'll drive you to a
safe house for 48 hours,

35:53.490 --> 35:55.640
and then we'll wally about 48 hours later

35:55.640 --> 35:59.510
over the next 48 hours and
get you to another safe house.

35:59.510 --> 36:01.930
Well, it's about an hour and a half,

36:01.930 --> 36:03.632
two hour drive tomorrow.
- Perfect.

36:03.632 --> 36:04.465
That's far enough--

36:04.465 --> 36:06.369
- I feel so damn near safe. (laughs)

36:06.369 --> 36:07.669
- [Grenville] Very scenic.

36:08.543 --> 36:10.940
- [Emma] It's not about what
you know, it's who you know.

36:10.940 --> 36:12.160
- [Jess] Definitely.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.060
- [Emma] Let's go.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.800
- [Narrator] Family friend, Grenville,

36:20.800 --> 36:22.497
has devised a plan to move the girls

36:22.497 --> 36:25.320
between a network of his associates,

36:25.320 --> 36:28.290
and he's giving them a
means of communication.

36:28.290 --> 36:30.413
- I've got a spare phone,

36:30.413 --> 36:33.070
and I'll be in touch with you tomorrow

36:33.070 --> 36:36.453
to tell you what time and
how we're gonna extract you.

36:37.380 --> 36:38.830
- [Emma] Amazing.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.540
- And I'll just say there's
gonna be a delivery.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.013
- And then use the code word Pepsi Max.

36:43.980 --> 36:45.300
Just gotta keep one step ahead.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.911
- Mm-hmm.

36:46.911 --> 36:48.701
Keep your rear cleared.

36:48.701 --> 36:49.534
- Yeah.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.673
- I have to say.
(laughing)

36:56.922 --> 37:00.530
- Very, very tiny getaway vehicle.

37:00.530 --> 37:02.590
It's more like Mr. Bean escaping

37:02.590 --> 37:04.140
instead of James Bond escaping.

37:05.230 --> 37:08.360
- [Narrator] HQ have received
CCTV footage of Jess and Emma

37:08.360 --> 37:12.410
getting into a vehicle
outside the Botanic Gardens.

37:12.410 --> 37:15.090
- Steve, the vehicle comes back to--

37:15.090 --> 37:17.133
- Is this Grenville Botham?

37:18.070 --> 37:21.103
- The only Grenville Botham
I can find is this guy.

37:21.103 --> 37:23.123
- Is he an ex-Royal Marine?
- Yeah.

37:24.517 --> 37:26.140
- Royal Marines commando.

37:26.140 --> 37:29.970
- Grenville Botham is a quite
high-ranking ex-Royal Marine

37:29.970 --> 37:32.180
so, yeah, he's probably
gonna make it quite difficult

37:32.180 --> 37:33.580
for us to trace these girls.

37:34.630 --> 37:37.550
- So, chief, we've got phone
details for Grenville Botham.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.340
Two mobile phone numbers.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.963
- Wet those numbers on
live intercept immediately.

37:42.853 --> 37:45.020
(beeping)

37:47.050 --> 37:48.700
- Fucking ring, ring, ring, ring.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.950
- [Narrator] At a safe
house arranged by Grenville,

37:52.950 --> 37:55.180
Jess and Emma are waiting to hear from him

37:55.180 --> 37:57.533
on the phone he gave them.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.040
(phone buzzing)

37:59.040 --> 38:00.070
- [Jess] Shit, the birds!

38:00.070 --> 38:02.403
- Open it.
- Oh my God, right!

38:03.950 --> 38:04.783
Yes!

38:04.783 --> 38:06.097
- Oh my God, he's so good.
- Pepsi collection between

38:06.097 --> 38:09.310
10 and 10:30 hours, driver's name is John.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.510
I will confirm vehicle
type at nine o'clock hours

38:11.510 --> 38:14.149
so make sure you are on this
network at nine o'clock.

38:14.149 --> 38:16.990
(cheering)

38:16.990 --> 38:18.430
Pepsi Max.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.380
- [Emma] Confirmed.

38:20.416 --> 38:22.042
(dramatic music)

38:22.042 --> 38:24.260
- Okay, thank you.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.880
So, chief, I've got some phone activity

38:26.880 --> 38:29.170
from Grenville Botham,

38:29.170 --> 38:32.440
and there's some text
messages coming in and out.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.910
- Does it look like we have got fugitives

38:34.910 --> 38:38.310
speaking to the Bothams?

38:38.310 --> 38:39.610
- Reading them texts, I'm pretty sure

38:39.610 --> 38:40.540
they've got Botham's phone.

38:40.540 --> 38:42.940
It appears that Pepsi delivery

38:42.940 --> 38:45.505
is code for picking up the girls.

38:45.505 --> 38:49.320
As in, I've arranged a
Pepsi delivery at 10AM,

38:49.320 --> 38:52.323
the driver's name is John, I
will confirm the vehicle type.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.307
- These young ladies are
not doing a very good job

38:55.307 --> 38:57.840
of covering their tracks.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.519
The minute they make their next move,

38:59.519 --> 39:01.173
that's when we'll pounce.

39:05.623 --> 39:09.090
(dramatic music)

39:09.090 --> 39:11.350
- Oh, wait, not back.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.920
- Hello, I'm Jess, this is Emma.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.060
- Hi, it's lovely to meet you.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.450
- Emma.
- Yes, thank you so much

39:15.450 --> 39:16.905
for taking us in.
- It's no worry.

39:16.905 --> 39:20.510
- It's like from car to car to car.

39:20.510 --> 39:21.816
- [Narrator] Jess and
Emma are getting a lift

39:21.816 --> 39:24.050
with Ed Anderson.

39:24.050 --> 39:26.340
- [Ed] I have a hotel in
Perth, the Royal George.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.040
I'm gonna put you up there tonight.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.230
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

39:30.230 --> 39:31.630
- [Narrator] He's the latest in a chain

39:31.630 --> 39:35.954
of people helping them, which
started with Grenville Botham.

39:35.954 --> 39:37.690
- Oh my God!
- God!

39:37.690 --> 39:38.770
- Thank you, Ed.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.198
- Would you like something to eat?

39:40.198 --> 39:41.760
- We would love something to eat.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.660
- [Ed] I'll get a menu up for you.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.419
- We've got a fantastic
network here in Scotland now.

39:45.419 --> 39:47.670
Everyone's been so kind.

39:47.670 --> 39:48.845
- [Emma] Am I allowed the salmon?

39:48.845 --> 39:49.678
- [Ed] You can have anything

39:49.678 --> 39:50.854
you want.
- Please.

39:50.854 --> 39:53.675
(cheering)

39:53.675 --> 39:55.360
- We've got a really,
really good thing here

39:55.360 --> 39:57.800
moving with these random people like.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.080
I don't know who they are,
Emma doesn't know who they are.

39:59.080 --> 40:02.387
And I'm hoping the hunters
have no idea where we are.

40:04.818 --> 40:06.640
- So Grenville's a facilitator.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.490
The end conversation
introduces a new number.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.430
This ties in with the text message

40:11.430 --> 40:15.330
saying their gonna use
this Marine network.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.060
- It's like their network are playing

40:17.060 --> 40:19.690
pass the parcel with Emma and Jess.

40:19.690 --> 40:21.520
They don't have a clue
that we're onto them.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.270
If they did, they wouldn't
be using this network.

40:24.270 --> 40:26.540
- So, chief, we've got
a completely new number.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.253
Comes back to Ed Anderson
in Central Perth.

40:30.270 --> 40:33.910
- So Ed Anderson owns the Royal.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.460
- George.
- Royal George Hotel?

40:35.460 --> 40:36.293
- [Woman] Yeah.

40:36.293 --> 40:37.126
- Let's get a ground hunter team

40:37.126 --> 40:39.518
there as soon as possible.
- Great, let's do it.

40:39.518 --> 40:41.962
(suspenseful music)

40:41.962 --> 40:45.270
- Network of individuals
are assisting Emma and Jess.

40:45.270 --> 40:48.530
Long story short, they've
ended up with Ed Anderson.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.096
Hence putting three ground hunter teams

40:50.096 --> 40:52.300
towards that Perth area.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.740
Thanks, everyone, good luck.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.010
- We've gotta get these girls.

40:55.010 --> 40:57.230
We haven't been this close
for the last week and a half.

40:57.230 --> 40:59.100
We're an hour away.
- I know, right?

40:59.100 --> 41:02.893
There is no fucking chance
that they are getting away!

41:08.222 --> 41:10.817
- Hi, Stewart, do you still
head down south every Friday?

41:12.140 --> 41:12.973
- [Stewart] Yeah.

41:12.973 --> 41:14.590
- [Stewart] Would you
have space in your car

41:14.590 --> 41:16.070
to take my friends?

41:16.070 --> 41:17.401
- [Stewart] Yeah, I'd
be happy to do that, Ed.

41:17.401 --> 41:19.298
No problem at all.
- Thanks very much for that.

41:19.298 --> 41:20.976
- [Stewart] Okay, right, take care.

41:20.976 --> 41:23.324
(cheering)

41:23.324 --> 41:24.157
- The stars are aligning.

41:24.157 --> 41:26.065
- Everything is just falling into place.

41:26.065 --> 41:27.666
- The starts are aligning,
that's what's happening.

41:27.666 --> 41:28.952
- Okay.
- Thank you so much

41:28.952 --> 41:32.290
for everything.
- Absolute pleasure.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.390
We're ready.
- Right.

41:36.570 --> 41:38.830
- [Narrator] Hotel owner Ed
is handing the girls over

41:38.830 --> 41:41.053
to his associate, Stewart MacRae.

41:42.286 --> 41:43.119
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:43.119 --> 41:44.330
- How you doing?

41:44.330 --> 41:45.163
- Stewart, thanks very much.

41:45.163 --> 41:47.600
- No problem, mate, see you soon.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.053
- [Narrator] But HQ are
monitoring Ed's phone.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.890
- Guys?
- Yeah.

41:51.890 --> 41:56.500
- We had a call made by Ed Anderson

41:56.500 --> 42:00.450
in Central Perth to an unknown number.

42:00.450 --> 42:02.663
- So potentially this is the handover.

42:03.744 --> 42:05.560
- [Woman] Okay, guys,
we have a name for that.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.450
That's Stewart MacRae.

42:07.450 --> 42:10.484
- Get that vehicle's details now please.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.082
- So I'm just staying home just now

42:12.082 --> 42:14.223
but you guys need a place to stay as well.

42:14.223 --> 42:15.469
- Yeah, is that okay?
- Possibly.

42:15.469 --> 42:18.077
- I can put you up for probably a night.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.440
- (sighs) Thank you so much.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.150
- We're trying to keep
as low-key as possible.

42:22.150 --> 42:23.277
- The first week, we were a bit stupid

42:23.277 --> 42:24.546
and we went out in public a lot.

42:24.546 --> 42:27.210
We've been in hiding for
the last like seven days.

42:27.210 --> 42:28.500
- And we're hoping the hunters
don't know where we are.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.830
- So we're going to Dumfries, yeah?

42:30.830 --> 42:31.663
- [Stewart] Yep.

42:31.663 --> 42:32.963
- Perfect!

42:34.740 --> 42:37.110
- So we've got CCTV in
from the Royal George.

42:37.110 --> 42:38.370
They're in their disguises.

42:38.370 --> 42:39.960
- Both of them?
- Yes.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.530
- Sweet.

42:41.530 --> 42:43.766
- Stewart MacRae, he's
gone to pick 'em up.

42:43.766 --> 42:47.090
- All right, guys, we've
got our first ANPR hit

42:47.090 --> 42:49.360
on the alpha nine.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.410
- [Man] Heading southbound.

42:50.410 --> 42:51.859
- Is it heading to Dumfries?

42:51.859 --> 42:53.150
That's where he lives.

42:53.150 --> 42:55.400
- Excellent, right, let
me let the guys know this.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.717
We believe MacRae has got
the girls in the vehicle

42:58.717 --> 43:01.650
and is probably heading towards Dumfries.

43:01.650 --> 43:04.050
Can you start heading towards the area?

43:04.050 --> 43:05.070
As soon as they're contained,

43:05.070 --> 43:07.001
we'll start squeezing on
it and get the captures in.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.430
- Cheers, buddy.
- We'll get them in the bag

43:08.430 --> 43:10.075
today, guys.
- Yes, please.

43:10.075 --> 43:12.933
- It's 15 miles to Dumfries.

43:12.933 --> 43:14.463
- They'll never find us.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.570
- I think we've been hidden
quite well, to be fair.

43:17.570 --> 43:18.584
- Yeah.

43:18.584 --> 43:21.417
(thrilling music)

43:23.561 --> 43:25.572
- [Man] If you can get a
long look on that property

43:25.572 --> 43:28.869
just in case they're
literally on top of it.

43:28.869 --> 43:30.780
- It's probably about
five minutes away now.

43:30.780 --> 43:32.011
- Okay, five minutes.

43:32.011 --> 43:33.223
- [Man] It's getting pretty close, like.

43:33.223 --> 43:34.294
- Very close.

43:34.294 --> 43:35.840
- So we have three minutes until

43:35.840 --> 43:39.120
MacRae's vehicle arrives at his property.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.630
- [Woman] We've got a long
eye on the front of the house.

43:41.630 --> 43:42.463
They're not there yet.

43:42.463 --> 43:43.658
- Okay, time over distance

43:43.658 --> 43:45.430
they should be at the
home address at this point

43:45.430 --> 43:47.380
if they were going there.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.947
- So where on Earth are they?

43:48.947 --> 43:51.170
- Where the fuck have they gone?

43:51.170 --> 43:52.860
- My sister's actually on holiday.

43:52.860 --> 43:53.693
- Oh, right.
- Oh, right.

43:53.693 --> 43:56.501
- So I'm thinking about just
having you sent to her house.

43:56.501 --> 43:58.668
- Okay, perfect.
- Perfect.

44:04.277 --> 44:05.950
My God, what a beautiful day.

44:05.950 --> 44:06.900
I want to sunbathe.

44:08.170 --> 44:09.530
- Thank you.
- Oh my God, sorry.

44:09.530 --> 44:11.330
Our bags are a bit too heavy.

44:11.330 --> 44:12.603
Ooh!

44:12.603 --> 44:13.784
- [Chief] Hi, it's the chief.

44:13.784 --> 44:14.617
- Hi, Boss.

44:14.617 --> 44:19.291
- The last ANPR sighting
of the target vehicle

44:19.291 --> 44:21.038
was very close.

44:21.038 --> 44:24.380
I want you three ground
hunter teams to basically

44:24.380 --> 44:27.540
swamp every road and find that car.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.890
- Cheers, boss.

44:28.890 --> 44:30.090
- Let's fucking have it.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.169
- Just go for it.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.930
I don't care they're driving
their big, shiny Volvos

44:34.930 --> 44:37.297
up and down the street and
potentially being spotted.

44:37.297 --> 44:39.637
I don't care, find the car.

44:39.637 --> 44:40.943
(squirting)

44:40.943 --> 44:42.136
(playful music)

44:42.136 --> 44:43.424
- Oh, feels good, right?

44:43.424 --> 44:44.393
Being sat in the sun?

44:45.270 --> 44:48.249
Sun cream reminds me of happy
times, just the smell of it.

44:48.249 --> 44:49.082
(coos)

44:49.082 --> 44:49.980
(laughs)

44:49.980 --> 44:51.260
This is the best.

44:51.260 --> 44:52.543
This is like gold, mate.

44:54.578 --> 44:55.830
- [Emma] I don't know how
you can just sit there.

44:55.830 --> 44:57.110
I get so bored.

44:57.110 --> 44:57.960
- I just love it.

45:00.607 --> 45:02.607
(yawns)

45:03.671 --> 45:04.630
- They're fucking here,

45:04.630 --> 45:05.830
where are they?
- Yeah.

45:09.250 --> 45:11.703
- We can't let these
two beat us, no chance.

45:12.945 --> 45:14.945
(sighs)

45:16.221 --> 45:19.638
- [Man] Starting to get on my nerves now.

45:24.190 --> 45:25.120
- [Man] What's that?

45:25.120 --> 45:27.324
- [Woman] That's them, that's the car!

45:27.324 --> 45:29.880
(suspenseful music)

45:29.880 --> 45:31.147
- That was a Volvo XC90.

45:31.147 --> 45:32.759
- Are you fucking joking?

45:32.759 --> 45:34.533
- I'm not wanking you up, no.

45:34.533 --> 45:35.366
I don't know where it went,

45:35.366 --> 45:36.975
but it went back down the road.

45:36.975 --> 45:38.230
- Back down the road?

45:38.230 --> 45:39.550
- There's no way they know we're here,

45:39.550 --> 45:41.161
nobody followed us here.

45:41.161 --> 45:44.161
(suspenseful music)

45:47.816 --> 45:49.378
- Jess, Jess, Jess, they've
seen us, climb over the fence!

45:49.378 --> 45:50.211
- No, they haven't.

45:50.211 --> 45:51.231
- Yes, they are, they're right there.

45:51.231 --> 45:54.095
- Yeah, back, in the back, in the back!

45:54.095 --> 45:55.095
- Oh my God!

45:56.988 --> 45:59.050
- You know what you just
told me is complete bullshit.

45:59.050 --> 46:00.740
You're stabbing in the dark.

46:00.740 --> 46:01.622
Don't ya?

46:01.622 --> 46:03.050
Come on.

46:03.050 --> 46:04.513
Look at me, you do.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.653
- So one in the field, one looks a bit.

46:07.653 --> 46:09.509
- That looks like a drone.

46:09.509 --> 46:11.041
For fuck's sake.

46:11.041 --> 46:12.920
Shit's just got real.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.496
Bastards!

46:14.496 --> 46:17.329
(thrilling music)
