01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
Light.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.250
Let me sleep.

01:49.020 --> 01:50.020
Enough!

01:59.870 --> 02:00.870
Light.

02:03.270 --> 02:04.560
Yes, everything, everything!

02:10.572 --> 02:14.512
Hey! You're crazy? TO? Give me more!

02:15.210 --> 02:16.860
Watch out, evil horse!

02:41.263 --> 02:42.263
Class.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.626
Hey boss, look, people are pouring in.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.650
It should be thrown away.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.930
I prefer to look for another horse.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.766
Nothing bad. You look like fire!

03:07.770 --> 03:09.090
Do you know that guy?

03:10.080 --> 03:14.666
This is Master Lu Liang. In appearance, he is just
a clown with a horse in a movie studio.

03:14.790 --> 03:19.429
But at one point, in Hong Kong, he was the best
double in the movie.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.350
The whole country knew Master Lu.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.756
KUNG FU STALLION

04:04.706 --> 04:06.039
Master Lu!

04:06.210 --> 04:07.860
Surprise! Well, how's life?

04:09.050 --> 04:10.540
TO! Dame, hello!

04:10.740 --> 04:11.970
Where were you?

04:13.050 --> 04:14.490
I already thought you were dead.

04:14.814 --> 04:17.940
Dami, you are a joker. I just win.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.210
Take, take it, I'll treat you. Aww!

04:22.716 --> 04:26.160
Yeah, well, you're a retired specialist. What kind of work is there
?

04:29.250 --> 04:30.960
How is your stable?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
She is not for sale.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.250
If you don't sell...

04:36.870 --> 04:37.870
Confiscate.

04:38.550 --> 04:40.440
Doesn't work, grandpa?

04:43.110 --> 04:44.880
Did you see the horse? Excellent casing.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.340
Lend me a horse for a couple of days.

04:47.843 --> 04:51.883
Ladies, it's not funny. Without him... how can I pay the debt?

04:58.650 --> 05:00.330
All! My jokes are over.

05:04.650 --> 05:07.403
I take your stallion as payment of a debt.

05:07.428 --> 05:09.990
No, no, please don't take Flame.

05:10.350 --> 05:11.610
Take the horse.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.970
No Dame. I... I beg you!

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
Grab it.

06:05.575 --> 06:06.696
It hurts, I guess.

06:08.848 --> 06:10.530
Hey! Hands off the fire.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.690
You shouldn't have listened to me.

06:32.970 --> 06:34.590
Come on! Baby jump!

06:37.036 --> 06:38.036
After him.

06:38.679 --> 06:39.679
I miss him!

07:06.750 --> 07:07.750
I'm sorry.

07:16.196 --> 07:17.196
There!

07:21.672 --> 07:22.672
Caution!

07:32.781 --> 07:33.981
And who are you?

07:41.078 --> 07:42.078
Crazy!

07:44.693 --> 07:45.693
Excuse me.

07:45.697 --> 07:47.603
The show must go on!

08:01.680 --> 08:02.680
Don't skip.

08:06.684 --> 08:09.150
We have to... shrink somehow, friend.

08:14.698 --> 08:15.698
Forward!

08:19.124 --> 08:20.317
For for!
Where is?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.583
Hey! Where are you?

08:36.120 --> 08:37.120
Well done.

08:49.104 --> 08:50.104
There!

08:57.840 --> 08:59.316
Fire follow me!

08:59.353 --> 09:00.353
Go Go.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.510
Where did grandpa go?

09:31.256 --> 09:32.256
Climb!

09:33.120 --> 09:34.120
Master Lu.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.460
Are you sleeping here again?

09:35.756 --> 09:37.440
What about you, do you feel it?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.160
Did you fight with your wife?

09:39.720 --> 09:41.940
She does not fight, she immediately kills.

09:50.519 --> 09:51.519
Teacher!

09:52.050 --> 09:53.343
Is my fool up?

09:53.970 --> 09:56.250
Yes. I can't wait to meet your beloved.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
Dead person.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.330
Are you Mr. Lou? Is he also Master Lou?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.749
Yes, whats up?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Hello.

10:36.090 --> 10:37.560
We are talking about your horse.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.828
Three years ago you got
Mr. Van's horse from LAM.

10:42.081 --> 10:46.074
Recently ended litigation litigation
"EL" and "DW Capital".

10:46.154 --> 10:51.030
As a result, DI Capital received
the right to recover any property from ElM

10:51.240 --> 10:54.180
and put it up for auction. Including the horse.

10:56.940 --> 10:57.960
See for yourself.

11:02.213 --> 11:03.253
Outside!
That?

11:03.480 --> 11:06.006
This is my horse! if you don't go now

11:06.300 --> 11:07.320
he will bite you.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.580
Master, what's up?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.453
They want to take Flame.
Have you lost your fear?

11:35.480 --> 11:37.080
Are you going to beat us?

11:37.170 --> 11:38.250
Nonsense.

11:39.330 --> 11:40.330
He is crazy.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.657
Suit up, Vin Diesel with minimum wage!
Check it out.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.120
We will be back very soon.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
Fools!

11:50.670 --> 11:52.320
I didn't understand a word.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.678
A friend's company went bankrupt. Firepaw's mother
belonged to him.

11:58.479 --> 12:01.800
Have Boss Wang call them. And he fixes everything.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.410
He died a year ago.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.510
If it was that easy, they wouldn't have come.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.963
Stop swinging!

12:09.930 --> 12:10.930
How annoying!

12:11.310 --> 12:12.310
Teacher.

12:13.110 --> 12:14.520
Maybe it's time to look for a lawyer?

12:14.820 --> 12:15.820
Okay, yes.

12:16.740 --> 12:18.060
What will I pay you?

12:32.760 --> 12:36.810
The request for execution
of the sentence was presented before this court.

12:36.960 --> 12:42.180
A property of our client is auctioned to pay debts.

12:42.510 --> 12:46.650
However, we would like to appeal
the decision of the lower court,

12:46.860 --> 12:49.439
to protect the violated rights of our
client.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.200
We ask that the auction be rescheduled.

12:54.780 --> 12:55.780
He is still here.

13:16.264 --> 13:17.541
Well, how are you, honey?

13:18.990 --> 13:20.160
Why did you come here?

13:24.780 --> 13:27.330
I am in trouble. We need your help.

13:28.590 --> 13:29.910
I need a lawyer.

13:30.947 --> 13:32.590
Have you broken the law?

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
What are you?

13:35.880 --> 13:39.390
No, it's not like that at all. It is about Ogonyok,
my horse.

13:40.031 --> 13:43.494
They want to take it away. Here, I need a lawyer.

13:43.521 --> 13:45.587
You can search ads.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.810
But I have come to you.

13:49.590 --> 13:50.590
I am not a lawyer.

13:51.420 --> 13:52.500
I am still learning.

13:57.060 --> 13:58.260
I have no money.

14:04.470 --> 14:05.470
Me too.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.680
I'm not asking you for money.

14:08.695 --> 14:10.680
I ask you to help me in court.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.200
Lu Liang...

14:15.870 --> 14:17.220
I don't want to meet you

14:18.270 --> 14:20.280
Whatever you get into, figure it out yourself.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.250
Do me a favor and disappear.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.600
Dad, don't you love me anymore?

14:37.584 --> 14:38.730
I love you so much, little girl.

14:38.970 --> 14:41.444
But I don't want to live with my mom.

14:41.850 --> 14:43.463
Well done. Excellent speech.

14:43.570 --> 14:45.930
Come on, don't cry.
Enough. Come on.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.801
Don't be afraid of anything. Do not be afraid. Bye sweetheart.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.950
Baby, don't cry. We will see you soon.
Do not even think about it.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.300
You won't see it.

14:58.980 --> 14:59.980
Cattle?

15:00.390 --> 15:01.390
Cattle.

15:01.830 --> 15:02.830
Unfortunately.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.900
I'm sorry.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.600
Sudden family problems.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.880
I missed your first meeting.

15:09.630 --> 15:12.063
In fact, I behaved vilely there.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.340
I'm glad you didn't see it.

15:15.630 --> 15:18.360
I proved that this man is a very bad father.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.270
And separated him from his daughter.

15:42.510 --> 15:43.510
Teacher.

15:43.830 --> 15:46.370
David! Did someone post a fight?

15:47.040 --> 15:48.420
Now no one is going to hire me.

15:49.909 --> 15:50.909
Master Lu.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.443
I came to invite you

15:53.760 --> 15:56.070
and your horse to star in my movie.

15:59.730 --> 16:00.730
To her.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.000
But there will be tricky tricks.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.120
Will the fire do it?

16:05.340 --> 16:07.292
Certainly. And how.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.360
I have been teaching him since childhood.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.020
He is my best student.
Yes, honey, come on.

16:14.970 --> 16:15.970
Say hello.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.180
Light.

16:19.620 --> 16:20.620
Will you be a star?

16:21.420 --> 16:23.993
Superstar. Light - Horse - fire! High five!

16:25.050 --> 16:26.050
Wow.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.550
Baby, listen.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.260
I beg you.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.720
Let's practice.

16:34.220 --> 16:37.326
Yeah, your dad... he lied a bit.

16:37.620 --> 16:40.620
But finally we will have
the opportunity to rise from below.

16:40.980 --> 16:42.810
What's the look? Don't turn your back.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.820
The specialist's eyes should burn!

16:45.330 --> 16:46.649
come on! Hop!

16:51.270 --> 16:53.820
Waitress, more please.
You're crazy!

16:54.480 --> 16:55.860
You can't drink that much coffee.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.400
We have to discuss something.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.099
my mom demands

17:03.390 --> 17:04.829
reunion with his family.

17:05.430 --> 17:06.750
How did you get off the chain?

17:07.619 --> 17:09.599
Have you forgotten that I am an orphan?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.930
My family tree is a stump.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.240
Why did it suddenly start up?

17:16.740 --> 17:19.020
We were thinking of getting married when you graduate.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.730
I released it in front of her.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.319
Well she immediately

17:23.430 --> 17:24.430
settlement.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.990
Well, tell him we haven't decided yet.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.816
But we decided.
Not yet.

17:29.857 --> 17:32.190
But this is a logical development of relations.

17:32.340 --> 17:35.610
Yes, but only I will decide
when I get married.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.530
Although I understand that you have old-fashioned parents
.

17:38.630 --> 17:40.310
Thank you for understanding.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.840
But in a global sense, you're right.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.330
So do not hang your nose. Good luck.

17:50.490 --> 17:51.490
Love.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.070
Why are you meeting him?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.480
bag,

18:20.250 --> 18:22.080
Do me a favor please.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.150
Please make peace with your father.

18:26.565 --> 18:27.565
Good mom.

18:28.104 --> 18:29.250
Enough already, okay?

18:29.760 --> 18:31.890
You've been asking me this for a million years.

18:32.460 --> 18:33.720
But he doesn't want to change.

18:34.410 --> 18:35.640
And you again for the old.

18:39.060 --> 18:41.160
And I will keep in
touch with him.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.050
For your own good

18:43.890 --> 18:44.890
But why?

18:45.270 --> 18:46.920
So you don't regret it later.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.190
For example,

18:48.450 --> 18:50.040
When is your graduation

18:51.390 --> 18:52.390
And a wedding.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.210
And you won't be there?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
Of course I'll do it.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
OK so.

19:04.256 --> 19:05.256
I do not need it.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.150
He did not keep his promises.

19:23.670 --> 19:25.833
Leave! How dare you? Leave!

19:25.858 --> 19:27.059
I didn't know her...

19:29.610 --> 19:31.912
Waited till he left, huh?

19:32.559 --> 19:34.420
I no longer have a father!

19:39.960 --> 19:42.217
Promise me just one thing.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.720
If your father finds you again

19:46.950 --> 19:48.510
don't walk away from him.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
promise me

20:15.413 --> 20:17.762
Twinkle, you're going to be a super horse.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.018
I can't refuse

20:45.928 --> 20:47.975
We are looking for talent! Call.

20:58.880 --> 21:04.159
Photo -15, ride - 50. Do you want a photo? TO?

21:17.547 --> 21:20.347
But who has seen an Indian wave a spear?

21:28.762 --> 21:30.402
come on
no thanks

21:37.322 --> 21:39.988
Only fifty per trip.

21:43.439 --> 21:44.558
What are you doing?

21:44.582 --> 21:45.662
Horses are not allowed.

21:46.052 --> 21:47.622
I'm sorry.
Moron.

21:48.572 --> 21:50.102
Look, there's a horse!

22:11.512 --> 22:12.752
Hey, come on.

22:13.322 --> 22:14.402
It is time to train.

22:15.992 --> 22:16.992
First

22:18.602 --> 22:20.462
rehearse your reaction.

22:21.932 --> 22:24.958
Now I'm going to punch you in the face.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.152
I will be gentle.

22:27.602 --> 22:29.582
But be real, okay?

22:30.272 --> 22:31.742
One two three.

22:34.082 --> 22:36.212
But don't dodge. Stay still and wait for the hit.

22:38.492 --> 22:41.882
Ogonyok, we are like filming a movie.
Why are you so serious?

22:42.782 --> 22:44.042
Are you throwing me a gauntlet?

22:45.062 --> 22:46.682
We won't get another chance like this.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.212
I need to rehearse.

23:23.702 --> 23:24.932
Judgment.

23:37.172 --> 23:38.172
It's not mandatory.

23:38.942 --> 23:40.532
Tell me more about the lawsuit.

23:40.802 --> 23:42.362
If you need a lawyer, I

23:42.602 --> 23:44.852
I can ask my boyfriend for help.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.002
Do you have a boyfriend?

23:49.022 --> 23:50.022
What's it called?

23:50.582 --> 23:51.582
It is none of your business.

23:56.552 --> 23:57.572
His name is Mickey.

23:58.322 --> 23:59.322
And who is he?

23:59.852 --> 24:00.852
A lawyer?

24:02.222 --> 24:04.952
It would be nice if his last name wasn't Mouse.

24:05.192 --> 24:06.192
And is he smart?

24:22.802 --> 24:23.999
No! Arrest!

24:42.572 --> 24:43.572
Hello Ogonyok.

24:44.678 --> 24:46.445
My name is...Bao.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.538
I hope these two get along there.

25:27.242 --> 25:29.012
Sir...
why so nervous?

25:30.272 --> 25:31.272
You are welcome.

25:36.585 --> 25:38.107
Yes of course.

25:44.012 --> 25:45.012
Can you fight?

25:49.352 --> 25:50.352
Struggle?

25:55.892 --> 25:57.482
to get to the hospital

25:58.142 --> 25:59.342
or behind bars, sir?

26:00.662 --> 26:01.662
Never.

26:02.462 --> 26:04.772
So how can you protect her?

26:05.552 --> 26:06.552
I can do it in court.

26:06.872 --> 26:07.872
Account?

26:13.682 --> 26:14.732
What happened to your face?

26:18.842 --> 26:20.072
Something so difficult?

26:29.732 --> 26:30.782
Why so nervous?

26:32.582 --> 26:33.582
Nothing.

26:34.502 --> 26:35.502
What was he talking about?

26:36.362 --> 26:37.362
Us...

26:41.042 --> 26:42.632
Haven't we talked about anything yet?

26:44.252 --> 26:46.052
We had a male conversation.

26:46.682 --> 26:51.032
Get it, Mickey. Don't forget, your time
is money. There is no need to be scared.

26:51.842 --> 26:52.902
Yes Yes. Well...

26:53.402 --> 26:54.402
Let's get to the point.

26:54.842 --> 26:57.242
And the thing is, you are our great and experienced lawyer.

26:57.594 --> 26:58.601
Mister.

26:58.922 --> 27:01.352
Please don't say I'm cool or experienced.

27:01.712 --> 27:03.625
Generally, the university

27:06.392 --> 27:08.632
I was only three years older than Bao.

27:09.782 --> 27:14.042
My internship ended
a month ago. I just received my license.

27:14.211 --> 27:16.022
I'm new to the office.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.392
Just call him Mickey.

27:41.462 --> 27:42.692
You and I are like brothers.

27:42.966 --> 27:44.402
Pay off the debt as soon as you can.

27:45.062 --> 27:46.062
The three million?

27:47.102 --> 27:48.482
Black days happen.

27:53.522 --> 27:54.522
Foal?

27:54.632 --> 27:55.632
Yeah.

27:57.632 --> 27:58.632
This is my mare.

27:59.522 --> 28:00.522
If you want, take it.

28:02.492 --> 28:03.492
Can?

28:04.682 --> 28:07.008
He is not a resident. Crooked legs, bad lungs.

28:08.222 --> 28:09.452
We will act with mercy.

28:11.762 --> 28:13.555
Does that mean it's going to be euthanized?

28:14.042 --> 28:15.212
They always do it.

28:29.822 --> 28:31.082
They want to go with me?

28:31.232 --> 28:32.232
Get up fast.

28:58.322 --> 28:59.322
Well done.

29:05.132 --> 29:07.112
Now we are together forever.

29:07.982 --> 29:09.452
What is your name baby?

29:13.542 --> 29:14.752
Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid.

29:15.062 --> 29:16.062
Well done.

29:17.042 --> 29:18.182
Ankle, baby.

29:18.992 --> 29:24.758
I know, I know, baby. That's all for today.
we are resting let's go let's go!

29:25.442 --> 29:26.582
Go! Here!

29:27.122 --> 29:28.802
Here here. Come here!

29:29.522 --> 29:31.382
Well done! Well done!

29:31.462 --> 29:32.462
Lynx!

29:33.032 --> 29:34.032
Lynx!

29:44.882 --> 29:46.262
You are handsome, right?

30:03.122 --> 30:04.122
Get up, fool.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.944
Don't get on your knees. Never!

30:29.652 --> 30:30.652
Class.

30:38.172 --> 30:39.172
What are you, sir?

30:40.572 --> 30:41.652
Come on, pet him.

30:43.932 --> 30:44.932
I don't want to

31:09.372 --> 31:10.372
caressed

31:11.622 --> 31:13.522
so what? On fire.

31:13.782 --> 31:14.952
To be honest,

31:15.222 --> 31:17.952
Legally, the situation is serious.

31:19.152 --> 31:22.392
That's why we need your help brother.
He quickly became your brother.

31:22.992 --> 31:25.672
I mean Minnie. Oh, I'm sorry, Mickey.
Nothing.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.975
Mickey, you have to cheer up.

31:31.062 --> 31:33.132
A couple of boxing lessons?
No, thanks.

31:33.252 --> 31:34.938
A man must be able to fight.

31:35.465 --> 31:36.982
Then I'll show you.

31:37.118 --> 31:39.462
Student, let's show your brother how to fight.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.235
Brother? I mean, me?

31:42.342 --> 31:43.962
Ogonyok is studying to be a double!

31:45.312 --> 31:47.112
Attractive. Lesson number one.

31:47.645 --> 31:49.338
How to take hits. Are you ready?

31:49.359 --> 31:51.039
No, I'm not ready.
Look.

31:52.602 --> 31:54.095
Honey, come on.

31:54.582 --> 31:55.582
See?

31:55.632 --> 31:57.342
Now there will be a coup. Continue.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.822
That? did you dodge?

32:03.942 --> 32:05.832
He wouldn't beat his horse, would he?

32:06.972 --> 32:08.142
So, Mickey, let's go.

32:09.138 --> 32:11.142
You will put on a glove and hit him.

32:11.632 --> 32:14.502
Can't. No sir. Can't.
And if he kicks?

32:14.612 --> 32:15.952
He is a professional.

32:16.512 --> 32:17.682
But I want to live.

32:18.222 --> 32:19.222
Once.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.432
No sir. I'm still so young.

32:21.491 --> 32:22.817
Bag! Bag!

32:29.165 --> 32:30.165
No.

32:30.342 --> 32:31.342
I'm sorry.

32:33.882 --> 32:34.882
You are covered.

32:36.672 --> 32:37.672
Friends?

32:38.630 --> 32:40.150
Take it easy, take it easy.

32:44.238 --> 32:45.898
Fire, bravo!

32:46.618 --> 32:47.618
Sit down!

32:47.745 --> 32:48.745
Lower!

32:48.912 --> 32:49.912
Excellent.

32:50.562 --> 32:51.562
Did you see that?

32:51.721 --> 32:54.522
Sir, but you're faking.
No, this is acting.

32:54.762 --> 32:56.172
It doesn't matter, I'm a lawyer.

32:56.388 --> 32:57.857
We were not prepared for this.
Quietly.

32:57.882 --> 32:58.882
He likes you.

32:59.172 --> 33:00.875
See? Scintillation!

33:01.022 --> 33:02.022
Get up!

33:02.544 --> 33:03.544
You've seen?

33:04.572 --> 33:05.697
What a great guy he is!

33:05.892 --> 33:06.892
I have an idea.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.472
We are going to teach you to kiss.

33:08.817 --> 33:10.677
So baby get up I will show.

33:11.597 --> 33:13.572
I'm afraid he'll kick me!
Calm down, I'll show you.

33:14.139 --> 33:16.492
Bao, say something.

33:18.852 --> 33:19.852
Come on, kiss.

33:47.082 --> 33:49.542
I hope you find the time

33:49.842 --> 33:53.022
to see the
brightest debut of the new double.

33:54.402 --> 33:56.172
Your father was the best in the profession.

33:56.517 --> 33:58.032
Hello.
Excellent.

33:58.272 --> 33:59.592
Don't worry, don't scare Lu's daughter!

34:00.806 --> 34:01.806
Look.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.132
Stay here while I go to work.

34:09.312 --> 34:10.512
Do not wander around the site.

34:16.871 --> 34:17.871
Come on, come on, come on.

34:18.522 --> 34:19.994
boss he.
Good afternoon.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.018
Director.

34:25.782 --> 34:26.782
Are you ready with that?

34:27.442 --> 34:29.442
Certainly. It's easier than ever.

34:30.911 --> 34:31.911
It's time?

34:32.831 --> 34:33.831
Well, go now.

34:34.871 --> 34:35.871
We are ready?

34:36.312 --> 34:37.312
Double one.

34:37.661 --> 34:38.661
Scintillation.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.748
Well go ahead. We are being filmed.

34:40.848 --> 34:42.286
Ready?
In places!

34:42.321 --> 34:43.567
And they started!

34:48.641 --> 34:49.641
Silence, silence, silence.

34:50.202 --> 34:51.612
What happened? Scared?

34:52.512 --> 34:53.982
What's happening? Who is it?

34:54.815 --> 34:55.815
Where he came from?

34:56.322 --> 34:57.910
Sorry Sorry. Give me another double.

34:57.935 --> 34:58.948
come on

34:59.142 --> 35:00.142
Fire, are you ready?

35:01.182 --> 35:02.712
After filming, you will be afraid.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.718
Three, two, one. Began!

35:10.700 --> 35:13.928
No no no. Arrest. Wait.

35:16.662 --> 35:19.182
While we did not turn off anything, we are waiting for a decision.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.242
Well, at whose expense are we standing?

35:23.682 --> 35:25.262
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

35:25.452 --> 35:26.532
How to shoot?

35:26.892 --> 35:28.332
Why hire an amateur?

35:29.472 --> 35:30.472
Come on, one more time.

35:30.732 --> 35:31.732
Replace this.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.092
We just wasted time.

35:34.302 --> 35:35.302
Come on!

35:37.167 --> 35:38.167
Oh okay.

35:38.352 --> 35:40.422
Guys, give me a five minute break!

35:46.032 --> 35:47.032
Master Lu.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.042
Very sorry.

36:44.374 --> 36:45.374
Leave me alone.

36:49.837 --> 36:50.837
Yes, you go!

37:18.882 --> 37:19.882
Light.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.372
OK dude.

37:21.702 --> 37:23.592
We will not force you to do anything.

37:24.222 --> 37:25.872
But if you yourself want

37:26.022 --> 37:27.552
then you will succeed.

37:28.332 --> 37:30.729
Do not be afraid. We are all with you. Yeah?

37:31.392 --> 37:32.392
come on

37:43.362 --> 37:44.722
Silence, silence, silence.

38:20.442 --> 38:21.442
I let it go.

38:22.332 --> 38:23.332
believe me sir

38:24.942 --> 38:27.188
Good? What are frozen? Forward!

38:27.665 --> 38:28.665
Get prepared!

38:28.842 --> 38:31.632
Let's go everyone Let's go.
We are filming!

38:40.902 --> 38:41.902
He'll be fine.

38:48.012 --> 38:49.012
Make room.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.942
Master Lu is still in the saddle.

39:58.988 --> 39:59.988
Wait!

40:03.605 --> 40:04.605
Forward!

40:47.318 --> 40:48.318
come on!

40:54.111 --> 40:55.111
Taken!

41:16.418 --> 41:18.094
Thank you. Thank you all!

41:20.178 --> 41:21.178
Yeah!

41:22.392 --> 41:23.392
Scintillation!

41:26.472 --> 41:27.472
I need it.

41:27.553 --> 41:28.553
Yes I understand.

41:38.772 --> 41:40.622
Come on One, two, three.

41:41.142 --> 41:42.142
Can't.

41:42.851 --> 41:43.898
Dad teaches.

41:44.232 --> 41:45.232
He is good.

41:45.792 --> 41:46.932
We are not afraid.

41:49.842 --> 41:50.842
Baby.

41:51.402 --> 41:54.115
Carefully. Your sister is new. Yeah.

41:58.122 --> 41:59.122
passed.

42:01.032 --> 42:02.262
Now I'm letting go.

42:04.932 --> 42:05.932
Everything's fine?
YO...

42:37.152 --> 42:38.742
Mr. Lu, you've been searched.

42:38.862 --> 42:39.862
It's playground time.

42:40.235 --> 42:41.237
Excellent.

42:41.262 --> 42:42.432
Your highlight.

42:43.842 --> 42:45.492
You have to read your contract.

42:46.602 --> 42:49.241
Contract? I don't have it. Why is he?

42:49.362 --> 42:50.442
Very even necessary.

42:50.742 --> 42:51.792
Useful in court.

42:52.692 --> 42:54.072
I don't understand anything.

42:55.089 --> 42:56.089
I will understand.

42:56.382 --> 42:57.382
The daughter will teach.

42:59.078 --> 43:00.078
Cold.

43:04.259 --> 43:05.259
Forward.

43:10.812 --> 43:14.111
No no. You can't go there. No. Are you complete?
Yeah.

43:15.732 --> 43:16.732
Good.

43:20.112 --> 43:21.112
Regulation...

43:21.462 --> 43:22.572
Help kind people.

43:22.872 --> 43:24.432
Always be honest with everyone.

43:24.762 --> 43:26.561
Do not pretend. do not steal

43:26.648 --> 43:28.992
Don't make fun of people and don't get into debt
.

43:29.772 --> 43:32.991
Mister. What happens if we lose the case?

43:33.372 --> 43:35.431
Practice, it will do you good.

43:38.022 --> 43:39.552
Did you say "stay out"?

43:40.812 --> 43:42.445
Yes. Some nonsense!

43:42.472 --> 43:43.848
This item is required.

43:43.872 --> 43:44.872
Yes, it's a horse.

43:45.102 --> 43:46.572
Why does an animal need a tent?

43:46.902 --> 43:49.332
To rest between
dangerous tricks.

43:49.482 --> 43:52.302
Just like my dad.
Yes. He's a stuntman!

43:52.309 --> 43:53.309
Signature!

43:56.892 --> 43:58.542
We start with four meters.

43:59.118 --> 44:00.582
Then go down to three.

44:00.882 --> 44:03.921
Two meters to ride and one to fall.
Good?

44:05.442 --> 44:06.442
Excellent.

44:07.032 --> 44:08.032
we sign

44:08.232 --> 44:09.232
The group is waiting for you.

44:10.999 --> 44:13.465
Sir, are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.

45:09.612 --> 45:10.612
Everything's fine.

45:14.382 --> 45:15.382
I am careful.

45:15.942 --> 45:16.942
Thank you.

45:52.632 --> 45:53.632
Shut up.

45:53.657 --> 45:57.342
Sir, can we sit down comfortably and discuss everything?

45:57.795 --> 45:58.795
No place is more convenient.

45:58.872 --> 46:00.072
But I'm here on business.

46:00.547 --> 46:01.547
Well say it.

46:03.192 --> 46:04.192
Cold.

46:06.672 --> 46:10.251
I went to the former employees of LEM, but
it did not work.

46:10.722 --> 46:13.062
But there's one I haven't met yet.

46:13.422 --> 46:14.712
Former owner of the mare.

46:15.492 --> 46:18.792
He will confirm that the Flame was
Mr. Wang's personal property.

46:22.602 --> 46:24.072
Who let you get up and drink?

46:24.402 --> 46:25.602
But that's how you want it.

46:25.632 --> 46:26.632
Feel!

46:27.887 --> 46:28.927
The Pope is numb.

46:29.112 --> 46:30.552
She'll thank you later.

46:46.711 --> 46:47.807
Thank you.

46:47.832 --> 46:51.838
Hello. I am the president of the
Flying Dragon Company... Ho Xing.

46:52.182 --> 46:53.182
Hello.

46:53.502 --> 46:54.502
Ask.

47:08.442 --> 47:09.442
Ask.

47:09.612 --> 47:13.482
I have fifty horses of different breeds
from almost thirty countries.

47:14.142 --> 47:16.932
I strive to collect first class horses.

47:17.142 --> 47:19.722
As you can see, they are given the best care.

47:20.055 --> 47:23.382
Mr. Lou, I'd like to talk
about your stallion.

47:24.882 --> 47:27.319
Two million, but he still refuses.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.622
You can imagine? It's not about the money here.

47:29.982 --> 47:33.672
Okay, Mr. Zhang, I'll see what
you sent me and I'll call.

47:33.852 --> 47:35.085
Boss.
come on

47:36.071 --> 47:37.992
ELM lost the lawsuit against DeWye Capital.

47:38.412 --> 47:41.365
Firepaw's mother: LinLon's mare was
owned by the company,

47:41.385 --> 47:43.008
Therefore, he is included in your list.

47:43.032 --> 47:44.172
It will be put up for auction.

47:45.612 --> 47:46.662
Curious.

47:49.075 --> 47:52.392
Well, call DH Capital and make a deal with them.
Understood.

47:54.942 --> 47:56.412
We will not agree to anything.

47:58.992 --> 47:59.992
Look. Who is it?

48:04.062 --> 48:05.292
Don't touch my stuff.

48:06.732 --> 48:07.872
How did you get in here?

48:08.712 --> 48:10.171
You don't have a door.

48:10.482 --> 48:12.775
Master Lou, nice to meet you.
Go out!

48:15.882 --> 48:18.222
You did not comply with
the court order willfully.

48:18.822 --> 48:21.582
We received an execution order
.

48:21.972 --> 48:23.625
Master Lou, check it out.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.792
What a hungry horse.

48:34.872 --> 48:35.872
Nothing.

48:36.072 --> 48:37.242
We have many copies.

48:38.532 --> 48:39.792
What is required of us?

48:40.602 --> 48:41.952
This horse is...

48:42.552 --> 48:44.352
Since you already went to court,

48:44.622 --> 48:46.842
Now we can file a counterclaim. Good?

48:47.472 --> 48:49.122
Yes, theoretically.
Very good.

48:49.632 --> 48:51.285
Shoot him down.
Hear.

48:52.182 --> 48:53.182
Who are you?

48:53.502 --> 48:54.502
Your agent.

48:54.612 --> 48:57.162
Is there a license?
How old are you?

48:57.441 --> 48:58.812
It is none of your business.

49:00.792 --> 49:03.312
I didn't say I was your lawyer, did I?

49:03.852 --> 49:04.992
I am a bailiff.

49:05.622 --> 49:06.622
Do not care?

49:09.402 --> 49:13.315
An order to execute
a lawsuit makes things much easier.

49:14.142 --> 49:16.482
I beg you to forget the way here.

49:16.782 --> 49:19.662
Tomorrow our lawyers will file objections to the lawsuit.

49:19.932 --> 49:21.711
We believe that you have been misinformed.

49:21.736 --> 49:24.732
The horse is not owned
by your company. Anything else?

49:25.122 --> 49:27.762
And you think so...
All questions to the lawyer.

49:28.092 --> 49:29.092
That's all.

49:29.982 --> 49:31.514
Honey, get them out.

49:33.498 --> 49:34.498
does it bite?

49:37.992 --> 49:38.992
Wait.

49:40.474 --> 49:41.474
Bag.

49:42.781 --> 49:45.372
Class. You tore them up as souvenirs.

49:45.852 --> 49:47.742
Epic earrings done!

49:49.032 --> 49:50.917
You see, it's not for nothing that I study.

49:50.991 --> 49:53.142
Scintillation. And your sister is great.

49:58.752 --> 50:00.162
What is "deviation"?

50:00.852 --> 50:02.682
If the judge does not support us,

50:02.802 --> 50:04.272
that will not cancel your claim.

50:04.452 --> 50:05.452
Then what?

50:05.537 --> 50:08.502
Let's appeal
the court order again.

50:08.952 --> 50:09.952
Good.

50:10.842 --> 50:11.842
What does it mean?

50:12.162 --> 50:13.162
The fire will not be taken.

50:14.202 --> 50:16.288
Ok, I like it. As.

50:22.122 --> 50:23.352
Have you read the contract?

50:24.013 --> 50:26.774
There should be air conditioning. Turn it on.

50:28.094 --> 50:30.529
But it's cold here, and there's ice cold water.

50:30.554 --> 50:34.214
You might look great in shorts and
a t-shirt. But he is in a tight suit.

50:34.818 --> 50:35.818
But I...

50:36.644 --> 50:37.644
Enough.

50:38.534 --> 50:39.534
Come here.

50:43.694 --> 50:44.694
Carefully.

50:47.144 --> 50:48.164
There is no fugitive here.

50:48.535 --> 50:50.274
And there, at the landing site,

50:50.444 --> 50:51.734
there will be nowhere to slow down.

50:52.188 --> 50:54.224
But Lou... There's plenty of room.

50:54.614 --> 50:56.108
You just... try it.

50:56.474 --> 50:57.474
Try it yourself.

50:59.294 --> 51:02.167
Listen, the run must be at least
thirty meters.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.472
thirty meters?

51:05.624 --> 51:07.424
It's true? You're sure?
Definitely.

51:07.784 --> 51:08.864
There is very little space here.

51:09.314 --> 51:10.784
Why didn't you say it before?

51:11.084 --> 51:13.064
We've built everything, and you're in denial.

51:13.244 --> 51:15.464
I have invested so much money in this site.

51:16.334 --> 51:17.504
Bao, let's talk.

51:21.704 --> 51:24.944
Study the contract. Does it make up for missed deadlines?

51:26.024 --> 51:27.134
But that's your problem.

51:27.674 --> 51:28.754
Our problem?

51:29.204 --> 51:30.944
No, we're fine here.

51:31.274 --> 51:33.434
Look, if he doesn't jump...

51:33.644 --> 51:39.849
The whole group - illuminators, cameramen,
workers, decorators, make-up artists...

51:43.941 --> 51:45.854
...they won't get any money. Are you alright girl?

51:46.010 --> 51:47.120
Who do you think you are?

51:47.564 --> 51:50.354
Enough already to build a producer here under
my charge.

51:50.864 --> 51:53.504
Do you want air conditioning? Be glad there is air.

51:53.595 --> 51:54.595
Â¡Ey!

51:55.334 --> 51:57.644
If you talk to my daughter like that, I'll kill you.

51:57.854 --> 51:58.854
Hear.

51:59.354 --> 52:01.754
This playground is your daughter.

52:01.994 --> 52:07.604
asked to build for you. It took us
more than a month. If you don't do the trick

52:07.844 --> 52:08.844
Do not bother,

52:09.374 --> 52:11.204
my boss will kill me without you.

52:12.494 --> 52:13.494
I'll jump

52:13.934 --> 52:14.934
There is no need.

52:15.490 --> 52:17.497
Stop shaking. Time is money.
Do not touch her.

52:18.224 --> 52:19.224
Prepare the people.

52:20.474 --> 52:21.474
Will you duck?

52:22.574 --> 52:23.574
i will jump

52:23.794 --> 52:25.544
Good. I'm leaving, I'm leaving

52:25.814 --> 52:26.814
He's gone

52:27.074 --> 52:29.267
Everybody get ready. Are the cameras ready?

52:29.384 --> 52:31.615
Dad, you can't jump!

52:31.640 --> 52:32.640
Bag.

52:33.524 --> 52:35.144
Our family has a rule.

52:36.344 --> 52:37.814
If daddy gave his word,

52:38.700 --> 52:40.964
daddy will keep it.

52:43.154 --> 52:45.374
Wait, when did you introduce this rule?

52:47.144 --> 52:48.144
Today.

53:08.804 --> 53:10.009
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.

53:15.164 --> 53:16.316
Come on, for Bao's sake.

53:47.114 --> 53:48.114
Ready baby?

53:55.424 --> 53:56.714
All cameras are motorized!

54:01.484 --> 54:02.834
Silence on the site.

54:03.044 --> 54:04.044
Began!

54:10.589 --> 54:11.589
Fire!

54:49.664 --> 54:50.664
Yeah!!!!

54:52.905 --> 54:54.098
Happened!

55:08.354 --> 55:09.354
I'm sorry.

55:31.964 --> 55:32.964
Bag!

55:33.914 --> 55:34.914
Do you have dinner?

55:35.245 --> 55:37.314
Everyone has already heard. Well done.

55:39.884 --> 55:40.884
double daughter

55:41.804 --> 55:44.564
only as good as your
hardest trick.

55:44.954 --> 55:46.454
And today we surprised everyone.

55:47.234 --> 55:48.234
Good trick.

55:48.734 --> 55:49.754
I have to celebrate.

55:51.404 --> 55:53.834
Yes, to celebrate what miraculously didn't break.

55:54.014 --> 55:55.334
Everything needs to cheer up.

55:55.724 --> 55:57.614
Besides, who knows what's coming.

55:57.854 --> 55:58.854
Illogical.

56:00.584 --> 56:04.057
I told you you look like
a K-pop idol in that wig, man.

56:04.634 --> 56:06.674
The girls will love it, yes.

56:07.424 --> 56:09.295
A client. to feel comfortable

56:10.604 --> 56:12.044
Excellent.
You are Zhi, right?

56:12.224 --> 56:14.024
Yes.
Look around you, everything is for you.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.464
Do you have Yong Wei's autograph?

56:15.764 --> 56:19.653
Why the hell is it necessary? There's Yin! The best
stunt double.

56:23.744 --> 56:27.014
The scenes you do are
for young stuntmen.

56:27.944 --> 56:29.894
You are too old for this.

56:31.964 --> 56:32.964
But apart from the tricks,

56:34.484 --> 56:35.594
I can not do anything

56:36.254 --> 56:38.144
Yes, you are old, Master Lou.

56:39.374 --> 56:40.784
Well, not exactly a disaster.

56:41.834 --> 56:43.304
Well, you have to.

56:45.254 --> 56:47.984
What a sweet and moving image.

56:48.644 --> 56:49.644
Hi babe.

56:51.044 --> 56:52.394
Master Lu.

56:52.994 --> 56:54.044
Talk business?

56:54.557 --> 56:56.504
Ladies, not now. I am with my daughter.

56:57.404 --> 56:58.404
With daughter?

57:00.434 --> 57:01.964
Do you have secrets for her?

57:02.414 --> 57:04.234
Then we'll talk, we'll have dinner.

57:05.624 --> 57:06.764
You owe me.

57:07.354 --> 57:09.074
If you don't pay now...

57:11.234 --> 57:12.374
As you can see she...

57:22.303 --> 57:23.593
Take it away! Behind him.

57:30.425 --> 57:31.425
Carefully.

57:40.226 --> 57:41.346
Get off her!

57:45.986 --> 57:46.986
Are you complete?

57:56.594 --> 57:58.754
The stars used
to have spittoons.

57:59.294 --> 58:00.704
Now they are not used.

58:03.107 --> 58:05.829
Crap. Hey Zhi, take care of the store.

58:12.344 --> 58:13.344
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

58:14.990 --> 58:16.574
It's okay, hold on to me.

58:16.690 --> 58:17.690
Get away, get away.

58:40.124 --> 58:41.234
Hit a disabled person?

58:41.392 --> 58:43.858
I'm on the plates as a terminator. Check.

58:44.290 --> 58:45.290
come on

58:46.724 --> 58:49.970
Police! Here's a bummer! Let's fight some more!
Where are you?

58:54.641 --> 58:55.641
Bag!

58:55.694 --> 58:56.727
Drop it.

58:56.768 --> 58:57.808
Let's run!
I'm sorry.

58:57.834 --> 58:58.834
Give me your hand.

59:00.765 --> 59:01.765
I have to run

59:01.833 --> 59:03.033
Go Go.

59:20.138 --> 59:22.610
Stop the horse! Stop!

59:26.144 --> 59:27.704
It's ok sir. Then we went.

59:28.214 --> 59:29.324
Good night.

59:29.864 --> 59:30.864
Stop, Bao.

59:33.830 --> 59:36.644
Can you visit me more often?

59:39.224 --> 59:41.054
Stop bullying, I'll come.

59:41.646 --> 59:43.154
Yeah, that guy started first.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.300
And the Light really shined today.

59:58.484 --> 01:00:00.854
I was very glad that you

01:00:01.034 --> 01:00:02.034
protected me.

01:00:15.914 --> 01:00:16.914
we also

01:00:18.254 --> 01:00:19.334
need protection.

01:00:24.134 --> 01:00:25.724
Don't complain, complain like an old man.

01:00:27.379 --> 01:00:28.551
I will not leave you.

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:31.912
Bye bye.

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:37.708
Go home.

01:01:02.712 --> 01:01:03.712
Why are you sad?

01:01:05.952 --> 01:01:06.952
dad said

01:01:07.842 --> 01:01:09.192
that needs protection.

01:01:12.342 --> 01:01:13.342
so strange

01:01:13.662 --> 01:01:15.732
It cannot be said that they are strangers to each other.

01:01:19.662 --> 01:01:21.192
But we weren't close.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.882
My parents divorced very early.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.662
I just saw it.

01:01:33.852 --> 01:01:35.566
everything everything Do not Cry.

01:01:35.772 --> 01:01:37.272
what a good girl

01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:39.042
I need to work.

01:01:39.522 --> 01:01:41.796
Yes, today is the night shift. I'm already waiting

01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:44.232
Leave if the work is more important.
Do you want to get divorced?

01:01:44.317 --> 01:01:46.561
Hello Bao. Come here. Hug dad.

01:01:46.992 --> 01:01:48.672
Mom, who is this?

01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:50.392
Your dad.

01:01:50.622 --> 01:01:51.672
Come on, don't be afraid.

01:01:52.662 --> 01:01:53.662
Do not be afraid.

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:09.785
Elegant.
Yeah.

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:24.878
Scintillation.

01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:30.967
Scintillation! For for.

01:02:31.392 --> 01:02:32.847
Baby are you complete?

01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:35.482
Not hurt?

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:37.662
Dad is proud of you.

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.708
Class, class, class.

01:02:39.732 --> 01:02:40.732
Get prepared.

01:02:41.098 --> 01:02:42.451
Silence on the set!

01:02:42.476 --> 01:02:45.208
Three, two, one!

01:02:52.992 --> 01:02:53.992
Are you okay, Ogonyok?

01:02:54.942 --> 01:02:55.942
Not hurt?

01:02:55.967 --> 01:02:57.448
Well done. come on

01:03:03.972 --> 01:03:05.592
Why is Firefire covered in wounds?

01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:08.562
Can you at least
put him in danger?

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:11.652
They are just scratches.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.422
You are too reckless.

01:03:14.922 --> 01:03:15.972
Reckless?

01:03:16.122 --> 01:03:17.122
You can not understand.

01:03:17.952 --> 01:03:19.572
Specialists have that job.

01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:23.202
Specialists yes, but Firepaw is not a specialist, Dad.

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:25.282
You're wrong.

01:03:25.872 --> 01:03:26.952
He is one of us.

01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:28.962
You do not understand anything.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.151
The time for people like you is over.

01:03:32.592 --> 01:03:35.205
Ours is coming in here. Point and shoot!

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.312
Here is the explosion point.

01:03:37.902 --> 01:03:39.522
You have to wait for the exact moment.

01:03:40.152 --> 01:03:41.152
Ready?

01:03:41.262 --> 01:03:42.668
Three! Two...

01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:47.659
From the road!

01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:49.739
It's too soon.
Call an ambulance!

01:03:49.932 --> 01:03:51.252
Extinguish! Extinguish! Faster.

01:03:58.722 --> 01:03:59.722
Take her home.

01:04:00.348 --> 01:04:01.348
It will be restored.

01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:06.972
You may not be able to get back on your feet.

01:04:12.162 --> 01:04:14.149
I taught him and I'm sure

01:04:16.782 --> 01:04:17.782
she will rise

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:21.152
I have never been so scared.

01:04:22.606 --> 01:04:25.122
I didn't convince her to leave this job.

01:04:26.502 --> 01:04:27.502
Specialist

01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:29.682
live at risk

01:04:36.642 --> 01:04:38.322
tell me what is life

01:04:38.576 --> 01:04:40.482
my dad and his friends

01:04:41.082 --> 01:04:42.132
Very simple.

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:44.422
Motor.

01:04:44.772 --> 01:04:45.772
Bounce.

01:04:46.422 --> 01:04:47.422
Hospital.

01:04:57.942 --> 01:05:01.542
Even if things go wrong,
don't be nervous. It's harmful.

01:05:01.742 --> 01:05:04.542
Do not be afraid. Better be glad for the teacher.

01:05:06.012 --> 01:05:07.012
Good?

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:08.542
As?

01:05:10.158 --> 01:05:11.295
I will die laughing.

01:05:16.676 --> 01:05:17.676
And this?

01:05:19.152 --> 01:05:20.152
Will this fit?

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.232
Where is the clown nose?

01:05:29.262 --> 01:05:30.462
Well, is this better?

01:05:30.762 --> 01:05:32.442
This is not bad. Put on your shirt.

01:05:32.622 --> 01:05:33.622
Refuel?

01:05:34.212 --> 01:05:35.212
Can't.

01:05:43.242 --> 01:05:44.242
It's no big deal.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:47.802
Master Lu, the main thing is that
you yourself like it.

01:05:50.322 --> 01:05:51.322
Hello.

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:53.152
Hello.
Hello.

01:05:54.222 --> 01:05:55.602
Hello.
My parents.

01:05:55.948 --> 01:05:57.175
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

01:05:57.552 --> 01:06:00.058
I'm Donald. This is my wife, Daisy.

01:06:00.305 --> 01:06:01.305
Hello.

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:03.384
I... I'm Lou!

01:06:03.882 --> 01:06:06.372
Please sit down, sit down.
Do not be shy.

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:08.092
Sit down.

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:13.848
Give me some water.

01:06:17.322 --> 01:06:20.112
Are Mickey's parents really named Donald and Daisy?

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:24.582
His father is two hundred years old.

01:06:25.272 --> 01:06:26.622
You're not a boy either.

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:32.322
Hey! Menu!

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:33.922
Drinking water.

01:06:37.242 --> 01:06:38.892
King crab seven kilos.

01:06:39.642 --> 01:06:41.472
Sir, we don't have that many.
It's true?

01:06:42.402 --> 01:06:44.567
Is there a Himalayan civet?
That?

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:47.262
Himalayan civet.

01:06:47.487 --> 01:06:50.142
Sorry, we haven't even heard of this.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:52.482
Clear.
You're always weird, dad.

01:06:53.082 --> 01:06:54.082
I will order.

01:06:54.672 --> 01:06:57.342
That's what his mom and I ate on our first
date.

01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:58.492
And she was born.

01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:03.954
Mr Lu.

01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.702
What do you do for a living?

01:07:06.882 --> 01:07:07.882
Â¿I?

01:07:08.952 --> 01:07:09.952
An important matter.

01:07:10.122 --> 01:07:11.172
I create movies.

01:07:12.852 --> 01:07:14.945
Creator! Interesting.

01:07:15.312 --> 01:07:17.112
I love the movies

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:19.032
Yasujiro Ozu.

01:07:19.572 --> 01:07:20.952
Andrei Tarkovsky.

01:07:21.324 --> 01:07:23.871
And this Indian - Abbas.
He is Iranian, dad.

01:07:23.965 --> 01:07:26.099
I just admire your work.

01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:28.136
Yes.
I'll be happy to discuss with you.

01:07:28.182 --> 01:07:30.708
Necessarily. tell me mr lou

01:07:30.882 --> 01:07:33.762
What exactly do you do in the film industry?

01:07:33.942 --> 01:07:34.962
Who I am?
Yeah.

01:07:35.592 --> 01:07:37.985
I jump out of the houses, through the glass, into the fire.

01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:41.681
I hold on to buses with an umbrella and
fly on cables.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:52.552
take more.

01:07:53.292 --> 01:07:54.292
Don't let it.

01:07:55.722 --> 01:07:58.842
Oh no, I can't take it anymore.
Then I'll eat a mussel. Want?

01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:00.412
No no.

01:08:02.194 --> 01:08:04.002
Dad, what's wrong with you today?

01:08:04.302 --> 01:08:05.502
Where are you in a hurry?

01:08:07.007 --> 01:08:08.007
I'm sorry.

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:09.352
I will say.

01:08:09.762 --> 01:08:10.762
you do not know

01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:12.972
On the first date with your mom

01:08:13.332 --> 01:08:14.982
I made her angry.

01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:20.471
So it is not clear how I was born at all.
And then I loved it.

01:08:22.242 --> 01:08:25.301
Well, girls are usually daddy's girls.

01:08:25.692 --> 01:08:28.782
They can see that they are
very close to each other.

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:31.362
In fact, my dad and I

01:08:32.051 --> 01:08:33.792
They haven't seen each other in over six years.

01:08:35.171 --> 01:08:37.392
And only recently they started talking again.

01:08:38.622 --> 01:08:40.332
You wanted to meet my parents.

01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:43.444
So, I only have one father like that left.

01:08:43.812 --> 01:08:44.812
I understand,

01:08:45.642 --> 01:08:48.011
It barely lived up to your expectations.

01:08:49.002 --> 01:08:50.442
But in the end

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:52.042
He's my dad.

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:59.171
I knew before dinner that I wouldn't
make a good impression on you.

01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:02.112
he can't pretend

01:09:02.502 --> 01:09:03.502
normal.

01:09:03.702 --> 01:09:04.702
Absolutely.

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:06.492
But he is very good.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:08.591
And very honest.

01:09:09.252 --> 01:09:10.692
And I began to be proud of him.

01:09:10.992 --> 01:09:12.282
when i got to know

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:16.511
Of course, I won't let him dictate anything to me
.

01:09:17.471 --> 01:09:19.362
But I will definitely give it a shot.

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:21.732
be my real father

01:09:24.192 --> 01:09:25.192
I know,

01:09:26.357 --> 01:09:28.602
that marriage is the union of two families.

01:09:29.352 --> 01:09:30.971
I am not trained in manners.

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:32.921
But I hope that you

01:09:33.221 --> 01:09:34.631
don't reject my daughter

01:09:35.232 --> 01:09:36.341
for such a father.

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:39.312
Not the best, to be honest.

01:09:41.232 --> 01:09:43.332
But since my daughter gives me a second chance,

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.412
I will try.

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:53.649
Nice to meet you.
See you later, uncle and aunt.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:54.749
Bye bye.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.134
Goodbye Sir.

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:03.202
Everybody is happy.

01:10:05.082 --> 01:10:06.552
You are really willing to try.

01:10:08.832 --> 01:10:09.882
How can I test?

01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:12.702
I want you to teach Firepaw another way.

01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:14.382
You don't have to handle it like that.

01:10:18.042 --> 01:10:21.012
Twinkle is my horse,
it's up to me how to train him.

01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:22.162
And you don't have to go up

01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:23.692
not in your business.

01:10:32.442 --> 01:10:34.152
What has played enough in daddy?

01:10:36.222 --> 01:10:37.722
I almost forgot who you are.

01:10:39.252 --> 01:10:40.663
You only think about work.

01:10:40.812 --> 01:10:41.812
You're a selfish.

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:45.462
You are rude and impolite. You are
acting like a naughty child.

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.582
I was ready to accept.

01:10:49.842 --> 01:10:51.372
But now I regret it.

01:10:52.302 --> 01:10:55.452
Even children are capable of compromise. I made
concessions

01:10:55.994 --> 01:10:57.432
and you don't care about anything.

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.052
I hoped you would understand.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.342
I have it.

01:11:04.992 --> 01:11:07.032
If you don't need a father, don't come.

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:13.512
Did you hear that, mom?

01:11:15.612 --> 01:11:17.022
He will never change.

01:11:26.562 --> 01:11:27.562
Teacher.

01:11:28.692 --> 01:11:29.692
Mother Lu.

01:11:30.342 --> 01:11:31.342
We are ready.

01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:35.392
Thank you.

01:11:37.632 --> 01:11:38.632
Buddy.

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:41.717
I might be wrong?

01:11:43.692 --> 01:11:44.692
Maybe,

01:11:45.012 --> 01:11:46.242
We need a change?

01:11:48.942 --> 01:11:51.215
From this day forward, we will listen to her.

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:54.292
Come on.

01:11:55.182 --> 01:11:56.182
Forward.

01:11:57.019 --> 01:11:58.878
How is the leg? Nothing?

01:12:00.012 --> 01:12:01.012
..

01:12:26.382 --> 01:12:27.629
Scintillation. Leg!

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.572
Scintillation. Be careful.

01:12:45.626 --> 01:12:48.526
Be careful not to step on it. Take it aside!

01:13:03.221 --> 01:13:05.232
Bao, find your father's papers.

01:13:05.532 --> 01:13:07.062
Who knows what we will need.

01:13:19.332 --> 01:13:23.532
Insurance policy. The insured
is Lu. Beneficiary - Bao.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:50.842
Hello Bao.

01:13:51.402 --> 01:13:52.482
What class are you in?

01:13:53.772 --> 01:13:54.772
Fifth.

01:13:55.272 --> 01:13:56.982
And why are you passing?

01:13:58.242 --> 01:13:59.242
How is your mom?

01:14:02.712 --> 01:14:03.852
I brought a gift.

01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:08.512
Honey, right?

01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:10.612
And then? Better.

01:14:20.887 --> 01:14:22.872
your dad took notes

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:24.492
all your meetings

01:14:24.672 --> 01:14:27.792
Then I watched them in a circle
when I missed you.

01:14:28.092 --> 01:14:29.922
Countless times.

01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:34.342
And always

01:14:35.082 --> 01:14:36.462
suffered terribly.

01:14:37.902 --> 01:14:38.902
Saying,

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:40.642
that very

01:14:40.872 --> 01:14:43.092
suffers from the way things turned out.

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:46.062
And looking forward to each new meeting of yours.

01:14:46.632 --> 01:14:47.982
And I regretted not being able

01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:49.662
make you happy.

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:47.242
Dad.

01:15:52.752 --> 01:15:53.752
I'm sorry.

01:15:55.122 --> 01:15:56.382
I didn't know anything

01:16:01.482 --> 01:16:02.592
Dad was stupid.

01:16:04.572 --> 01:16:05.572
I was blind.

01:16:18.222 --> 01:16:20.442
Promise you won't leave me again.

01:16:24.308 --> 01:16:25.308
i will not quit

01:16:33.402 --> 01:16:34.632
And risk less.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:36.592
I will try.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:39.708
It's true.

01:16:42.775 --> 01:16:43.775
And Ogonyok?

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.042
Enough of your tricks.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:50.272
I promise.

01:16:50.652 --> 01:16:52.151
It's true?
It's true.

01:17:04.782 --> 01:17:06.072
Well, what are you, millionaires?

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:07.512
Why spend money on me?

01:17:07.842 --> 01:17:08.922
I also have clothes.

01:17:09.552 --> 01:17:11.022
Throw away everything old.

01:17:11.652 --> 01:17:14.502
You will be our fashionista.
Yes, I have a lot of new clothes.

01:17:15.072 --> 01:17:17.412
And who will impress other parents?

01:17:21.072 --> 01:17:22.072
Bag?

01:17:22.782 --> 01:17:24.022
Come on, be bold.

01:17:28.632 --> 01:17:29.632
Bag?

01:17:29.742 --> 01:17:31.855
What other parents?

01:17:32.592 --> 01:17:33.592
Whose parents?

01:17:37.782 --> 01:17:38.782
Bag.

01:17:39.582 --> 01:17:41.412
Please don't joke like that again.

01:17:42.432 --> 01:17:43.452
Broke my heart.

01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:46.302
Well, I haven't actually said yes yet.

01:17:57.102 --> 01:18:00.122
Who said it would be cool?
I have excellent taste

01:18:00.162 --> 01:18:02.182
This is all I chose.
console yourself

01:18:13.932 --> 01:18:14.932
Don't be so hasty.

01:18:15.478 --> 01:18:16.478
Take it easy.

01:18:16.782 --> 01:18:18.192
Are you throwing everything away?

01:18:19.392 --> 01:18:21.252
Yes, it's reasonable. Here's another package.

01:18:21.732 --> 01:18:22.842
Look, this isn't stealing, is it?

01:18:23.862 --> 01:18:25.602
Trust treatment.
What article?

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:28.152
Three hundred thirty one.
Three hundred eleven.

01:18:28.332 --> 01:18:29.332
How did you pass?

01:18:30.432 --> 01:18:31.542
This article is not applicable.

01:18:31.842 --> 01:18:34.288
Friendship theft.
Something new. But will be.

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.542
We run there.

01:18:39.342 --> 01:18:40.342
Youth.

01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:41.512
Where did you go?

01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:36.802
Send Bao.

01:19:38.652 --> 01:19:39.762
Lou's will

01:19:41.622 --> 01:19:44.532
All my money and prizes
will be inherited by my daughter Bao.

01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:49.152
As well as my property and a horse
named Fuego.

01:20:20.862 --> 01:20:22.182
There was so much pain.

01:20:29.442 --> 01:20:30.442
A lot.

01:20:31.782 --> 01:20:33.282
Do not look at me like that.

01:20:35.688 --> 01:20:37.037
Dad, you're great.

01:20:58.634 --> 01:20:59.634
Day.

01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:37.064
come on

01:21:53.864 --> 01:21:56.234
After the operation, they sent me to Hong Kong.

01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:58.830
I am complete, I am complete.

01:21:59.474 --> 01:22:00.794
With brain damage.

01:22:01.424 --> 01:22:03.224
He spent eight months in a coma.

01:22:04.634 --> 01:22:06.494
I couldn't speak for over a year.

01:22:07.724 --> 01:22:10.904
Much has been erased, amnesia.
Why did not you tell me?

01:22:12.074 --> 01:22:13.544
I haven't worked for over a year.

01:22:14.144 --> 01:22:15.144
Spoiled.

01:22:16.574 --> 01:22:17.574
Everyone left.

01:22:18.824 --> 01:22:20.144
I'm stuck in debt.

01:22:20.744 --> 01:22:22.677
Little by little it collapsed.

01:22:23.624 --> 01:22:25.484
He went down to the bottom.

01:22:27.284 --> 01:22:29.474
Due to this, he naturally fell into depression.

01:22:30.584 --> 01:22:31.724
I saw no one.

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:34.704
Including mom.

01:22:37.214 --> 01:22:38.214
I was afraid.

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:41.144
And he let her down a lot.

01:22:51.164 --> 01:22:52.164
Then I

01:22:52.694 --> 01:22:54.284
I forgive you on his behalf.

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:13.854
Here!

01:23:21.674 --> 01:23:22.674
come on

01:23:36.443 --> 01:23:37.803
Hug him tight.

01:23:41.324 --> 01:23:42.324
Stop!

01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:39.890
Scintillation!

01:24:40.605 --> 01:24:41.605
Aid!

01:24:41.736 --> 01:24:42.736
Carefully.

01:24:50.684 --> 01:24:52.464
Dude, forget about him.

01:24:56.029 --> 01:24:57.229
Help daddy.

01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:58.890
There are many of them here.

01:25:07.977 --> 01:25:10.323
Young man, weren't you taught to respect your elders?

01:25:11.654 --> 01:25:12.654
I respect you.

01:25:14.611 --> 01:25:16.116
Fighting is not good.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.980
So why are you fighting with yourself?

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.574
Scintillation. Your dad is being beaten.

01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:30.374
Are you sitting and relaxed?

01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:33.134
Good girl. Feel.

01:25:33.314 --> 01:25:35.594
Who do you listen to?
What are you waiting for?

01:25:35.841 --> 01:25:36.841
Beat him!
That?

01:25:37.064 --> 01:25:38.064
Second round?

01:25:43.604 --> 01:25:44.604
Climb!

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.895
Wait wait. Wait.

01:26:04.634 --> 01:26:05.634
Are you tired?

01:26:07.724 --> 01:26:08.724
No!

01:26:47.021 --> 01:26:48.381
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:26:55.302 --> 01:26:56.302
Let go!

01:27:01.498 --> 01:27:02.498
Are you complete?

01:27:03.764 --> 01:27:05.477
Why didn't you... drop it?

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.947
My hands are stuck.
And don't fight.

01:27:11.714 --> 01:27:13.934
Now. Wait, I'll bring it to you.

01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:15.511
Help the boss.

01:27:18.074 --> 01:27:19.074
Let's go

01:27:24.224 --> 01:27:25.224
Ladies.

01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:32.454
Hear.

01:27:33.464 --> 01:27:34.544
You are a normal boy.

01:27:35.294 --> 01:27:36.734
Why are you doing this?

01:27:37.454 --> 01:27:38.774
There has to be something.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:40.484
You are a kung fu master.

01:27:40.754 --> 01:27:42.854
You don't have to be a collector.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.114
Work needs to change.

01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:48.374
Become a stuntman and lie like a corpse in front of
the camera?

01:27:49.154 --> 01:27:51.764
Early in my career, I excelled in corpse roles.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.354
That's how they noticed me.

01:27:53.954 --> 01:27:54.954
I can teach.

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.204
Next time.

01:27:59.174 --> 01:28:00.404
You will be my student.

01:28:02.024 --> 01:28:03.764
But don't fight with your brother.

01:28:03.884 --> 01:28:05.324
By the way, here it is.

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:06.364
WHO?

01:28:08.474 --> 01:28:09.474
Hold on ladies.

01:28:09.554 --> 01:28:10.694
But what about the money?

01:28:36.074 --> 01:28:37.074
Â¡ Yun Wei!

01:28:38.984 --> 01:28:39.984
Master Lu.

01:28:43.004 --> 01:28:44.004
What is this?

01:28:45.254 --> 01:28:46.254
brother,

01:28:47.054 --> 01:28:48.434
How did you get here?

01:28:48.614 --> 01:28:50.324
No company, no home either.

01:28:50.984 --> 01:28:52.484
Packed and shipped.

01:28:54.074 --> 01:28:56.114
Enough space, no one interferes.

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:57.360
Near work.

01:29:00.494 --> 01:29:01.494
You are still the same.

01:29:01.994 --> 01:29:03.284
It hasn't changed at all.

01:29:03.614 --> 01:29:04.994
You care about others.

01:29:05.839 --> 01:29:07.532
Don't think about your pain.

01:29:08.054 --> 01:29:09.054
Everything's fine.

01:29:09.584 --> 01:29:13.304
I rejoice in the success of my students and
friends. Come on, sit down, sit down.

01:29:18.134 --> 01:29:19.587
What destinations? Talk.

01:29:21.014 --> 01:29:22.014
that paper

01:29:22.904 --> 01:29:24.554
after which I became a star,

01:29:25.724 --> 01:29:26.724
she was yours

01:29:27.464 --> 01:29:29.144
It's all nonsense.

01:29:29.984 --> 01:29:32.174
They were looking for a bright young talent.

01:29:32.954 --> 01:29:33.954
And found.

01:29:34.364 --> 01:29:35.444
You are a big star.

01:29:38.684 --> 01:29:40.274
After moving to Hong Kong,

01:29:41.684 --> 01:29:44.954
I couldn't even afford the noodles
. You brought me to the shoot.

01:29:46.096 --> 01:29:47.654
I was so reckless

01:29:48.254 --> 01:29:49.254
if not you,

01:29:51.014 --> 01:29:52.014
I would have died.

01:29:53.624 --> 01:29:55.574
I wouldn't let that happen, honey.

01:29:56.594 --> 01:29:57.794
it's easy to jump

01:29:59.294 --> 01:30:00.554
hard to land.

01:30:03.974 --> 01:30:04.974
It's easy to jump.

01:30:06.584 --> 01:30:07.634
The landing is difficult.

01:30:14.324 --> 01:30:15.734
I started as a specialist.

01:30:16.154 --> 01:30:18.194
And now I want to pay tribute

01:30:18.494 --> 01:30:20.264
the true spirit of specialists.

01:30:20.894 --> 01:30:23.054
Let's make a movie about them. My movie.

01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:26.144
Like old times. And you will lead.

01:30:28.754 --> 01:30:32.024
I'm too old for this.
The daughter forbids doing tricks.

01:30:32.117 --> 01:30:33.124
But be afraid.

01:30:33.284 --> 01:30:36.176
We have the best equipment and
safety equipment.

01:30:36.243 --> 01:30:37.923
It's not about safety.

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:40.470
Brother.

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:42.970
You've always been in the shadows.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.860
on the big screen were

01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:46.390
Others.

01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:51.100
The time has come for
yours to finally appear in it.

01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:12.230
Assistant

01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:13.430
asked a lot.

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.680
The for sale.

01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:17.530
Come on sit down. You will manage quickly.

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.540
Baby.

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.860
Dad is old.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.670
But he wasn't used to giving up easily.

01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:49.390
Current viewers do not know our achievements.

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.150
Someone has to show them.

01:31:53.534 --> 01:31:55.180
Yun Wei has a great idea.

01:31:55.690 --> 01:31:57.040
I was very moved.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800
Baby.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.360
Listen, dad.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.200
You are not just any stallion.

01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:14.110
You have great potential.

01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:16.720
All you need is an opportunity.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.890
And your talent will conquer all.
Don't be afraid, I'll help you.

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.540
We train.

01:32:24.316 --> 01:32:25.316
Was

01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:26.710
Yes, is here.

01:32:27.137 --> 01:32:28.137
Dad!

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.789
We found evidence.

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.060
By.

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.440
We got in touch with Linlon's former owner. He said
that he belonged to Wang personally.

01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:41.410
Didn't the flame belong to the company?
Definitely.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.000
thanks mickey

01:32:46.767 --> 01:32:47.807
Thank you all.

01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:49.010
Not at all, sir.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.953
Thanks Bao. Thank you.

01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:02.210
What are you doing?

01:33:07.566 --> 01:33:08.566
Wait wait.

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:09.650
Listen to me, Bao.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.240
You know the movie star Yun Wei, right?

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.420
He gives us a unique opportunity.

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:18.880
I must agree

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.580
What does must mean?

01:33:24.993 --> 01:33:27.130
You children don't understand.

01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:29.080
You don't understand this.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.460
Do you want to risk it?

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:32.630
But for what?

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:34.940
For fame?

01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:36.470
Pride?

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.250
The so-called stunt spirit?

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.640
true specialists

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.740
do not retire

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.390
Specialists do not break the promise they made to your daughter.

01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:01.052
Baoo, please. Wait, Bao.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.622
A very important scene.

01:34:20.647 --> 01:34:22.693
Three, two, one. Engine!

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.760
Brother.

01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:34.670
Brother.

01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:36.230
our director

01:34:36.256 --> 01:34:37.603
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:39.850
Yun Wei talks about you all the time.

01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:41.770
Teacher.
He is wearing a vest.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.980
Look.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.100
This is a digital preview of the scene.

01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:55.970
Awesome!

01:34:56.170 --> 01:34:58.300
Now they watch cartoons before they shoot, right?

01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.910
Yes, not like before.

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.930
This will help us add cj during
final editing.

01:35:05.093 --> 01:35:06.106
That?

01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:08.470
Ordinary computer graphics.
Special effects.

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.720
effects

01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:12.520
We are all getting ready to
adjust to the fall.

01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:14.170
So, prepare your horse.

01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:16.370
And this is for you.

01:35:18.867 --> 01:35:19.867
We will do

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800
TRUE.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.290
Excuse me, how is it?

01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:25.630
Fire and I will make a fall.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680
So that?

01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:29.320
Wait, are you kidding?

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.780
Now they don't really fall off.

01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:34.570
So you're lying to the audience.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.130
We use technology.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.300
Why take the risk?

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.110
Do you think I can't?
Brother, that's not the point.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.972
Master Lu, please don't be stubborn.
It's okay, I won't bother you. I'm sorry.

01:35:48.997 --> 01:35:50.130
Wait. Brother.

01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:53.260
I'm sorry. I am going to talk with them. I'm sorry.

01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.563
Excuse me, give us a minute.
OK.

01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:59.350
Look, there are new ways to film.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.308
But it kills the spirit of stunts.

01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:06.730
Brother, listen...
I don't want to hear anything. We shoot as before.

01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:08.650
Or we do not shoot at all.

01:36:09.834 --> 01:36:11.701
One more word and I'll be gone.

01:36:12.095 --> 01:36:13.400
Ok go!

01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.660
I want to glorify you, not film your
death.

01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:20.200
If I resort to these things,

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:21.790
I will never forgive myself.

01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:24.460
I need a real movie

01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:27.790
then shoot for real, like before.

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:29.750
Guileless.

01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:34.070
I'll go get ready.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.380
Baby.

01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:50.890
Daddy has little to give you.

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.050
but if you manage

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.700
your life will change

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:56.450
Can.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.230
Get prepared.

01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:02.080
Camera, engine...

01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:04.490
And they started!

01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:07.660
For the sake of saving the country.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.310
I beg you emperor

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.250
don't break your vows. Give people a chance.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.540
This is my last trick.

01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:59.290
Last fight.

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:17.560
It's not a double.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.630
A boy who wants to please his dad.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.740
And he gets hurt too.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.300
I'll help you.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.840
We train.

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.130
What are you doing? Stop!

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:40.490
Don't act like that.

01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:41.810
Keep calm.

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.790
You may not use it for your own purposes.

01:40:14.088 --> 01:40:15.954
Is complete? What have you got there?

01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:18.160
I am complete, I am complete.

01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.140
Baby.

01:40:34.869 --> 01:40:35.869
I'm sorry.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.760
Maybe,

01:40:41.743 --> 01:40:43.077
it's time to stop.

01:40:46.842 --> 01:40:47.842
Cold.

01:40:50.322 --> 01:40:51.322
We do not.

01:40:53.292 --> 01:40:54.775
Hello Wei!
Goes.

01:40:55.522 --> 01:40:56.829
Hello.
Hello.

01:40:56.883 --> 01:40:57.883
Are you complete?

01:40:57.912 --> 01:40:58.912
I'm sorry.

01:40:58.992 --> 01:40:59.992
Can't.

01:41:01.362 --> 01:41:02.362
Finish.

01:41:03.202 --> 01:41:04.775
I'm sorry.
Trivia.

01:41:05.082 --> 01:41:06.082
Don't worry.

01:41:06.358 --> 01:41:07.358
I am happy.

01:41:08.022 --> 01:41:09.672
I didn't think it would come to this.

01:41:10.962 --> 01:41:11.962
deshonrado

01:41:12.792 --> 01:41:13.792
It's easy to jump.

01:41:14.052 --> 01:41:15.162
The landing is difficult.

01:41:15.432 --> 01:41:16.432
You yourself spoke.

01:41:16.902 --> 01:41:19.362
He shouldn't have made Firepaw do the trick.

01:41:20.172 --> 01:41:22.602
I've been jumping and falling all my life.

01:41:23.742 --> 01:41:29.442
But as I lay there, I realized for the first time that
the true stunt spirit is indestructible.

01:41:31.482 --> 01:41:34.408
Friends and family are what you should cherish.

01:41:36.042 --> 01:41:38.412
Director Tang, I was blind. I'm sorry.

01:41:38.742 --> 01:41:42.342
I admire your courage and resilience.
Thanks brother.

01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:44.832
Thanks for giving me one last chance.

01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:47.668
But maybe I am everything.

01:41:49.032 --> 01:41:50.032
No, forget it.

01:41:50.802 --> 01:41:52.122
I'm a stunt double.

01:41:52.242 --> 01:41:54.702
A stuntman doesn't need a cartoon stuntman.

01:41:56.185 --> 01:41:58.242
Come on. It's time to go home, Twinkle.

01:41:59.982 --> 01:42:00.982
Was.

01:42:01.182 --> 01:42:04.242
Thanks brothers! Thanks thanks. Thank you.

01:42:15.492 --> 01:42:16.989
My sweet girl.

01:42:17.562 --> 01:42:19.782
Dad learned to compromise.

01:42:23.742 --> 01:42:26.172
I know you've been waiting too long for this.

01:42:27.342 --> 01:42:28.342
I'm sorry.

01:42:42.582 --> 01:42:43.582
Home?

01:42:51.162 --> 01:42:55.632
There is an affidavit from Mr. C,
the former owner of Linlon.

01:42:56.652 --> 01:43:01.618
It follows from them that Linlon was acquired
by Mr. Van in personal possession by

01:43:01.643 --> 01:43:07.782
980 thousand. But due to a temporary
cash shortage, Mr. Wang made an advance

01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:09.998
payment of the corporate account "LM".

01:43:10.212 --> 01:43:11.982
However, three days later,

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:14.562
March 16, 2015

01:43:14.832 --> 01:43:18.762
the same amount was transferred from
Mr. Wang's personal bank account

01:43:18.882 --> 01:43:20.142
to the corporate account "LM".

01:43:21.042 --> 01:43:22.632
even if it's true

01:43:22.812 --> 01:43:27.822
used a corporate account and did not
compensate the company for interest earned.

01:43:29.082 --> 01:43:33.792
And the company files show that
the transfer paid the costs,

01:43:34.362 --> 01:43:38.652
Associated with another horse
named Hurricane, not Linlon.

01:43:39.822 --> 01:43:41.442
Mr. Wang's signature.

01:43:43.332 --> 01:43:44.332
This is true?

01:43:45.306 --> 01:43:46.509
It's just a mistake.

01:43:46.533 --> 01:43:51.162
Please keep order.
Here is the accountant's certified statement.

01:43:51.552 --> 01:43:53.682
Confirm the existence of the translation.

01:43:53.802 --> 01:43:55.002
You faked everything.

01:43:56.472 --> 01:43:57.912
I warn you again.

01:43:58.062 --> 01:44:00.072
The defense can continue.

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:07.032
We can not give up.

01:44:07.332 --> 01:44:09.005
We have no right. No!

01:44:12.672 --> 01:44:13.672
Dad?

01:44:21.912 --> 01:44:23.172
I didn't protect him.

01:44:24.193 --> 01:44:25.432
He trusted me a lot.

01:44:37.512 --> 01:44:39.102
Thank you.
Trust!

01:44:39.612 --> 01:44:40.752
A trusted deal.

01:44:41.142 --> 01:44:46.620
Article 311 - The goods are transferred to the ownership
of the buyer on the basis of an oral agreement.

01:44:46.645 --> 01:44:49.578
In the case of Ogonyok, in all respects,
it corresponds to the article.

01:44:49.865 --> 01:44:51.225
We have already lost.

01:44:51.372 --> 01:44:52.372
It's all over.

01:44:54.012 --> 01:44:55.672
Mister! Mr. Ho, stop!

01:44:56.108 --> 01:44:57.108
Mr Ho!

01:44:57.342 --> 01:45:01.190
Hear. Yes, we really lost.
But please don't destroy the family.

01:45:01.215 --> 01:45:04.122
I have always believed that the law should be
harsh but fair.

01:45:04.272 --> 01:45:05.802
Ogonyok was born sick.

01:45:06.132 --> 01:45:07.132
and teacher lou

01:45:07.272 --> 01:45:10.032
prevented him from being sacrificed. He saved him.

01:45:10.872 --> 01:45:13.572
For you, it will be an exhibition, a toy.

01:45:13.842 --> 01:45:16.465
And for Lou - a child, his son.

01:45:16.932 --> 01:45:19.962
After all, you probably know the feeling
Master Lu is experiencing.

01:45:21.522 --> 01:45:23.882
I assure you that we are fine

01:45:24.132 --> 01:45:25.132
take care of the horse

01:45:25.422 --> 01:45:27.982
And even better than Master Lu. He will get
stronger.

01:45:28.152 --> 01:45:29.682
Well, we can too.
Hear.

01:45:30.942 --> 01:45:33.402
We will not put you in danger.

01:45:35.352 --> 01:45:36.942
I also love horses very much.

01:45:37.662 --> 01:45:38.662
And I know them.

01:45:39.062 --> 01:45:42.042
Trust me, Ogonyok will be much better with me.

01:45:43.772 --> 01:45:45.038
Good luck.
Mr Ho!

01:45:45.432 --> 01:45:46.432
Please.

01:45:46.602 --> 01:45:49.242
You can't live without it.
Enough, finish it.

01:46:02.862 --> 01:46:05.862
Why can't I
help the most defenseless?

01:46:07.812 --> 01:46:09.192
You did everything you could.

01:46:17.052 --> 01:46:18.052
Mister.

01:46:19.482 --> 01:46:20.712
Everything we lost.

01:46:21.042 --> 01:46:22.092
It needs to be recognized.

01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:23.752
Head up.

01:46:24.222 --> 01:46:26.502
No matter what, you can't hang your nose.

01:46:28.392 --> 01:46:29.392
Excuse me sir.

01:46:30.162 --> 01:46:31.542
I was too naive.

01:46:32.892 --> 01:46:33.892
You were young.

01:46:35.052 --> 01:46:36.052
Thank you.

01:46:54.282 --> 01:46:55.282
Baby.

01:46:58.992 --> 01:46:59.992
Unfortunately,

01:47:00.942 --> 01:47:01.942
it's all over.

01:47:10.722 --> 01:47:11.722
Soon

01:47:11.952 --> 01:47:13.812
Dad can't take care of you.

01:47:18.355 --> 01:47:19.355
Come here.

01:47:27.792 --> 01:47:29.052
Remember what I tell you.

01:47:31.212 --> 01:47:32.212
You are the best.

01:47:36.402 --> 01:47:37.452
You will go far.

01:47:38.442 --> 01:47:39.442
Head up.

01:47:48.942 --> 01:47:50.052
Everything will be fine.

01:47:55.002 --> 01:47:56.002
Light.

01:48:18.882 --> 01:48:19.882
Want

01:48:22.092 --> 01:48:23.382
last workout?

01:48:28.992 --> 01:48:29.992
Cold.

01:48:39.492 --> 01:48:40.492
Idiot.

01:48:41.292 --> 01:48:42.292
Dodge.

01:48:43.452 --> 01:48:44.622
if they hit you

01:48:45.822 --> 01:48:46.822
Dodge.

01:48:48.552 --> 01:48:49.552
Again.

01:49:14.232 --> 01:49:15.372
future owner

01:49:16.962 --> 01:49:18.912
will not praise you like a father.

01:49:20.622 --> 01:49:21.622
Stay strong.

01:49:22.512 --> 01:49:23.512
Do you understand?

01:49:24.462 --> 01:49:25.462
you are an adult

01:49:27.072 --> 01:49:29.112
You must be able to protect yourself.

01:49:30.951 --> 01:49:34.122
Whatever you face, take a hit.

01:49:35.382 --> 01:49:37.156
And don't forget about your dad.

01:49:39.882 --> 01:49:40.882
I'm sorry.

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:45.048
It's dad's fault.

01:49:45.072 --> 01:49:47.238
I didn't protect you.

01:50:42.072 --> 01:50:43.072
Light.

01:50:43.962 --> 01:50:44.962
be young

01:50:49.658 --> 01:50:50.658
We have arrived.

01:50:50.888 --> 01:50:51.888
Disengage.

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.243
Scintillation.

01:50:58.268 --> 01:50:59.268
Come on.

01:51:11.078 --> 01:51:12.078
Nothing.

01:52:26.138 --> 01:52:27.138
be young

01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:35.310
It has character.

01:52:36.518 --> 01:52:37.598
Please do not hit me.

01:52:42.668 --> 01:52:43.838
He has weak lungs.

01:52:44.813 --> 01:52:46.068
He is often sick.

01:52:48.038 --> 01:52:49.038
Thank you.

01:53:07.358 --> 01:53:08.358
Go.
Sir.

01:53:09.638 --> 01:53:10.638
Edema.

01:53:13.448 --> 01:53:14.448
Light.

01:53:14.528 --> 01:53:15.528
Do not be afraid.

01:53:20.678 --> 01:53:21.678
Factory.

01:53:44.198 --> 01:53:45.198
Let it run.

01:53:50.768 --> 01:53:51.768
Light.

01:54:09.315 --> 01:54:10.315
Dad!

01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:30.625
Stay.

01:54:40.148 --> 01:54:41.148
Who called you?

01:54:45.638 --> 01:54:46.638
Leave.

01:54:52.538 --> 01:54:53.538
Go out.

01:54:56.708 --> 01:54:57.708
Leave.

01:54:59.558 --> 01:55:01.178
come back, get out

01:55:06.758 --> 01:55:08.288
I do not need you anymore.

01:56:17.648 --> 01:56:18.908
Let me remind myself.

01:56:19.698 --> 01:56:23.978
I'm Mickey Luo. Due to university rules,

01:56:24.458 --> 01:56:25.868
I can't represent you.

01:56:26.318 --> 01:56:27.318
But...

01:56:27.878 --> 01:56:29.078
I can and want to help.

01:56:33.848 --> 01:56:35.528
Beware of the angry horse.

01:56:39.218 --> 01:56:40.928
The bad horse no longer exists.

01:56:53.108 --> 01:56:54.398
My father is a dreamer.

01:56:55.598 --> 01:56:57.578
Their love is a passionate struggle.

01:56:59.048 --> 01:57:02.408
This applies to work,
to me, and, of course, to Ogonyok.

01:57:03.871 --> 01:57:05.678
His love is incomparable.

01:57:06.608 --> 01:57:09.068
He lost half his life for the love of work.

01:57:10.358 --> 01:57:12.998
Have mercy, do not deprive him of at least
one friend.

01:58:20.565 --> 01:58:22.118
Let me sleep a little more.

01:58:32.268 --> 01:58:33.268
Scintillation?

01:58:37.208 --> 01:58:38.208
Fire...

01:58:40.622 --> 01:58:41.622
Scintillation.

01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:44.960
It's you?

01:58:46.215 --> 01:58:47.958
Scintillation. I missed you a lot.

01:58:48.015 --> 01:58:49.241
How did you get here?

01:58:50.198 --> 01:58:51.308
Did you run away yourself?

01:58:55.431 --> 01:58:57.138
As? How did you come back?

01:59:03.518 --> 01:59:05.348
I promise not to leave you again.

01:59:05.858 --> 01:59:06.998
Never again.

01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:10.238
Your house has not changed. See?

01:59:10.748 --> 01:59:12.861
Everything is in its place, even the straw. See?

01:59:13.478 --> 01:59:14.478
Look.

01:59:15.034 --> 01:59:16.928
Here, everything is in its place.
Thank you.

01:59:17.648 --> 01:59:19.718
even if you didn't come

01:59:19.838 --> 01:59:22.028
He would still soon return the Fire.

01:59:23.011 --> 01:59:24.211
Because?

01:59:26.234 --> 01:59:27.878
He refused the food.

01:59:28.368 --> 01:59:29.484
We will have everything as before.

01:59:30.121 --> 01:59:31.121
small fire.

01:59:32.348 --> 01:59:33.848
fire, no. Get up!

01:59:34.388 --> 01:59:35.388
There is no need.

01:59:35.738 --> 01:59:36.788
Do not do it anymore.

01:59:37.478 --> 01:59:38.708
I know horses.

01:59:39.128 --> 01:59:40.508
and i never saw

01:59:40.808 --> 01:59:43.388
such readiness for
self-sacrifice,

01:59:44.048 --> 01:59:45.068
Like the fire.

01:59:46.238 --> 01:59:47.238
My baby.

01:59:47.378 --> 01:59:49.951
Now you're going to take your dad everywhere, right?

01:59:50.558 --> 01:59:53.858
You showed me teacher Lou's notes and I realized

01:59:53.978 --> 01:59:55.268
how similar they are

01:59:56.318 --> 01:59:58.778
Both are willing to sacrifice their lives.

01:59:59.048 --> 02:00:00.068
for love.

02:00:03.008 --> 02:00:04.628
He is also a student of a kung fu master.

02:00:05.318 --> 02:00:06.668
Kung fu masters?

02:00:10.358 --> 02:00:11.468
Already impressed.

02:00:24.134 --> 02:00:25.598
Dad!
Mister.

02:00:29.356 --> 02:00:30.943
Children, thank you.

02:00:30.968 --> 02:00:32.858
Thank you thank you thank you.

02:00:33.248 --> 02:00:34.248
Thank you.

02:00:45.878 --> 02:00:49.598
The film is dedicated to stuntmen,
kung fu masters, stuntmen,

02:00:49.778 --> 02:00:51.788
and also to all those who stayed behind the scenes.

02:00:51.998 --> 02:00:55.838
But it contributed to the centuries-old history
of Chinese cinema.

02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:58.396
A Larry Yan film

02:01:00.130 --> 02:01:01.655
Engine! we started.

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.960
So clear. Another double.

02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:06.110
WELL WELL.

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.520
I agree,

02:01:07.759 --> 02:01:08.925
but listen

02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:11.290
Did you notice that I was moving sideways?
She observed.

02:01:11.416 --> 02:01:12.963
And the camera is there.

02:01:13.357 --> 02:01:15.037
I have to get into the frame.

02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:16.250
Specialist

02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.060
You should always be able to keep up the frenzy.

02:01:19.293 --> 02:01:20.293
That?
Understood?

02:01:20.327 --> 02:01:21.327
Understood. Hit.

02:01:21.567 --> 02:01:22.607
Blow... blow.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.910
Maybe we'd better discuss the lawsuit?
Come on.

02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:26.570
Now.

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:30.593
I can not anymore

02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:32.950
Again.
Give me a second.

02:01:33.108 --> 02:01:34.306
I can't do it right away.

02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:35.330
Help him up.

02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:38.030
Hold him.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.766
...of buildings, through glass and over stoves.

02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:45.940
What other dish? To the kitchen?

02:01:47.063 --> 02:01:48.308
Well, it's also open.

02:01:48.333 --> 02:01:50.050
No, they don't install them.

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.388
Okay, I understand, but I...

02:01:54.388 --> 02:01:55.388
I jump.

02:01:57.787 --> 02:02:02.540
Well, I jump off the building through the glass and fall into
the fire.

02:02:03.593 --> 02:02:04.793
What are you doing?

02:02:11.213 --> 02:02:12.213
come on

02:02:17.912 --> 02:02:18.912
Are you capricious?

02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:21.497
Why are you so selfish?

02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:22.630
If it doesn't fall...

02:02:24.227 --> 02:02:25.587
If I don't fall...

02:02:26.050 --> 02:02:27.450
If I don't fall...

02:02:27.757 --> 02:02:29.437
If I don't fall, oh, that's all.

02:02:29.462 --> 02:02:30.722
Take it away!
That?

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.700
We're not done! I didn't get to say
a word!

02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:35.680
Came back. Escape! Again.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:37.520
Come on, I'll serve you.

02:02:40.544 --> 02:02:41.544
He is good.

02:02:42.027 --> 02:02:43.027
I still have.

02:02:51.823 --> 02:02:52.823
He is good.

02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:54.470
Nothing, there's more.

02:02:56.183 --> 02:02:57.220
And he is good.

02:02:57.490 --> 02:02:58.490
Now pour.

02:02:58.730 --> 02:02:59.800
And I still have.

02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:00.980
come on

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.416
We laugh, we laugh. More active.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.610
Yes, thanks.

02:03:18.036 --> 02:03:19.036
Again.

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440
come on

02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:30.460
Well done Jackie! Super.

02:03:30.743 --> 02:03:33.810
Here it is applauded, but for me this is something common.

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.940
Come on!

02:03:44.535 --> 02:03:45.535
Taken!

02:03:55.581 --> 02:03:56.581
Here is a nail.

02:03:56.770 --> 02:03:57.880
Pull out the nail.

02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:08.230
More more! Fall!

02:04:12.335 --> 02:04:13.375
I am complete, I am complete.

02:04:23.737 --> 02:04:24.857
How strong

02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:36.620
Excellent.

02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:37.970
Thank you all.
