Let's hear it for the Sermonson
High School marching band.

00:20.683 --> 00:22.836
Whoo!
Good job.

00:23.076 --> 00:24.243
Great job.

00:26.346 --> 00:28.280
It is my sincere hope
that this center

00:28.348 --> 00:30.282
will become a beacon
of academic excellence

00:30.350 --> 00:33.219
in an underserved community
for years to come.

00:33.286 --> 00:34.720
Clara, would you do
the honors, please?

00:34.788 --> 00:35.955
Of course.

00:38.024 --> 00:38.991
Thank you,
Mrs. Musso,

00:39.059 --> 00:40.693
for your friendship
and generosity.

00:40.761 --> 00:42.328
You're welcome, governor.

00:49.169 --> 00:50.336
Thank you, ladies.

00:51.738 --> 00:54.206
For many years,
and I speak to you today

00:54.274 --> 00:55.608
not as a politician

00:55.675 --> 00:58.911
but along with my wife
as parents.

00:58.979 --> 01:00.546
Public education in America

01:00.614 --> 01:01.914
has been in peril.

01:01.982 --> 01:06.218
You know the refrain... lack of
funds, underqualified teachers,

01:06.286 --> 01:07.753
negligent parents.

01:07.821 --> 01:12.291
And to this I say,
no more excuses.

01:22.068 --> 01:23.936
The guy in the denim
jacket... do we know him?

01:24.004 --> 01:25.404
...Vote
for accountability.

01:25.472 --> 01:28.107
Cast your vote for...
Denim jacket. 11:00.

01:28.175 --> 01:31.177
...Vote for this
great state of Virginia.

01:31.244 --> 01:33.078
Governor,
your car's waiting.

01:34.714 --> 01:36.782
Thank you, kind voters
of Virginia.

01:43.657 --> 01:44.857
Thanks very much
for coming out.

01:44.925 --> 01:46.392
Appreciate the support.
Thank you.

01:46.459 --> 01:48.527
Thanks very much for your help.

01:48.595 --> 01:49.695
Thanks very much
for your support.

01:49.763 --> 01:51.030
It's nice to see you today.

01:51.097 --> 01:53.265
Great to see you.
Thanks very much for your support.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.934
Let's go get them.

01:55.001 --> 01:56.502
Let's get out and vote, huh?

01:56.570 --> 01:58.237
Thanks for your support.

01:58.305 --> 01:59.772
Thank you for the support.

02:03.643 --> 02:04.910
Thanks for coming today.

02:15.622 --> 02:17.256
The governor's down.
He's hit.

02:33.373 --> 02:35.841
There's no such thing
as an "assassin's gaze."

02:35.909 --> 02:37.476
All right.
So I can report back

02:37.544 --> 02:39.945
that you can't tell if Duane
Corey was acting alone.

02:40.013 --> 02:41.347
Didn't
say that.

02:41.414 --> 02:42.348
No, he had an accomplice.

02:42.415 --> 02:44.116
It was the governor.

02:44.184 --> 02:45.751
What? Come on.

02:45.819 --> 02:47.519
I know. It turns your
stomach, doesn't it?

02:47.587 --> 02:48.888
The governor
knew Michelle daly.

02:48.955 --> 02:51.490
Of course he knew her.
She was a staffer.

02:51.558 --> 02:55.094
No, he "knew" knew her.
Know what I mean?

02:55.161 --> 02:58.731
Flirtatious,
flared nostrils, admiring look.

02:58.798 --> 03:00.266
Yeah,
she really fancied him.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.600
The FBI is
paying you to find out

03:01.668 --> 03:02.768
if the governor
was acting alone,

03:02.836 --> 03:04.470
not dig into the
governor's personal life.

03:04.537 --> 03:06.071
No, the FBI's paying me
to poke around

03:06.139 --> 03:07.006
and, you know, find the truth.

03:07.073 --> 03:09.708
I'm not a glorified cop, Ben.

03:09.776 --> 03:11.310
Foster, show Reynolds
the situation.

03:11.378 --> 03:12.878
The governor's in a tight race.

03:12.946 --> 03:14.013
Too close to call.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.382
A staffer who was
clearly more than that

03:16.449 --> 03:17.483
was shot dead.

03:17.550 --> 03:18.851
Now the man's
back up in the polls.

03:18.919 --> 03:20.219
You can't ignore the possibility

03:20.287 --> 03:23.088
that the girl was just a victim
of a 9-point bullet bump.

03:24.491 --> 03:25.424
Where
are you going?

03:25.492 --> 03:26.625
To see the governor.

03:26.693 --> 03:29.094
Cal, listen.
Brooks isn't just any old governor.

03:29.162 --> 03:32.097
I know. He's a close and
personal friend of yours.

03:32.165 --> 03:34.767
I appreciate this must
be difficult for you.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.769
As the majority stakeholder
in this firm...

03:36.836 --> 03:40.639
see, I bet that you regret
saying that already.

03:40.707 --> 03:43.142
Just go easy on him.

03:43.209 --> 03:45.244
Ok? I respect
this man a lot.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.947
Someday he could be president.

03:48.014 --> 03:50.182
Not with this girl's blood
on his hands, he won't.

03:50.183 --> 03:55.083

to hardship and suffering,

04:25.385 --> 04:26.952
but the death of Michelle daly

04:27.020 --> 04:29.355
is especially cruel
and incomprehensible.

04:32.592 --> 04:33.959
Dr. Foster.

04:34.027 --> 04:36.462
Or may I call you Gillian?

04:36.529 --> 04:37.763
I see Clara Musso called

04:37.831 --> 04:39.164
to give you a heads-up.

04:39.232 --> 04:41.533
Which is why my will
to win this race

04:41.601 --> 04:43.702
is only strengthened
by all our desires,

04:43.770 --> 04:44.903
each and every one of us,

04:44.971 --> 04:46.772
to stand strong
in the face of adversity.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.441
So I invite all of you to join
my staff, my family, and me,

04:49.509 --> 04:51.477
in our prayers for the
family of Michelle daly

04:51.544 --> 04:53.112
in the wake of this
terrible tragedy.

04:54.214 --> 04:55.647
Which is why the governor here

04:55.715 --> 04:56.982
has decided to retain
the Lightman group

04:57.050 --> 04:58.817
to get to the truth
behind all of this.

04:58.885 --> 05:01.520
Dr. Lightman, I've read all your books.
Big fan.

05:01.588 --> 05:04.156
That's cobblers.
Try and change the subject.

05:04.224 --> 05:05.524
All right?
Not with me.

05:05.592 --> 05:07.726
Ladies and gentlemen,
the governor would like

05:07.794 --> 05:09.294
to invite you all
to warm up your coffees

05:09.362 --> 05:10.929
and grab some more pie
before he continues

05:10.997 --> 05:13.399
the question and answer segment
of today's visit.

05:13.466 --> 05:16.035
Please. Help yourselves.

05:18.104 --> 05:19.538
I'm not sure I follow.

05:19.606 --> 05:20.706
Well, do your best, governor,

05:20.774 --> 05:22.574
you know, for the dead
girl in the morgue.

05:23.710 --> 05:24.643
I beg your pardon?

05:24.711 --> 05:26.011
No, don't beg.
See, look,

05:26.079 --> 05:27.546
it frightens the voters.

05:29.049 --> 05:29.982
Governor?

05:30.050 --> 05:31.483
Not a good idea.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.752
This is Lightman
being discreet.

05:33.820 --> 05:34.987
If Michelle daly's not enough

05:35.055 --> 05:37.356
to haunt the governor
for the truth,

05:37.424 --> 05:39.358
Lightman is.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.426
What do you want from me?

05:40.493 --> 05:43.262
Well, a 9-point bump
in the polls

05:43.329 --> 05:44.797
24 hours before the election

05:44.864 --> 05:46.498
because a girl took
a bullet for you.

05:46.566 --> 05:48.567
I want a little bit more
than coffee and pie.

05:48.635 --> 05:49.802
Know what I mean?

05:52.205 --> 05:53.839
My place or yours?

05:53.907 --> 05:55.841
If it were a choice between
losing the election

05:55.909 --> 05:57.843
and having Michelle
back with us,

05:57.911 --> 05:59.478
I'd gladly choose the latter.

05:59.546 --> 06:02.614
My place, then.
Let's keep it official.

06:04.317 --> 06:06.518
Clear his schedule
this afternoon.

06:06.586 --> 06:08.554
No more excuses, governor.

06:16.529 --> 06:18.730
Brooks is a dog that needs to be

06:18.798 --> 06:20.933
taken out back and put down.

06:22.202 --> 06:24.069
Wow. No.
That guy's a lone wolf.

06:24.137 --> 06:26.472
No way he's gonna help Corey.

06:26.539 --> 06:28.440
Oh, well, you know,
don't lose hope.

06:28.508 --> 06:29.908
We still have 42 more videos

06:29.976 --> 06:31.477
of guys who claim

06:31.544 --> 06:32.611
That they want Brooks dead.

06:32.679 --> 06:34.913
Are you chatting online
while I'm over here

06:34.981 --> 06:36.281
looking for an assassin?

06:36.349 --> 06:37.816
What?
You have a new girlfriend?

06:37.884 --> 06:38.851
No. No, no, no, no.

06:38.918 --> 06:40.452
Just a friend who
happens to be a...

06:40.520 --> 06:41.687
Emily Lightman?

06:42.856 --> 06:44.189
Please try not to judge.

06:44.257 --> 06:46.125
You're cyberfriends with Emily?

06:46.192 --> 06:47.893
Judgment all over your face.

06:47.961 --> 06:49.094
Look, she friended me.

06:49.162 --> 06:50.462
She's the boss's daughter.

06:50.530 --> 06:51.630
What am I supposed to do?

06:51.698 --> 06:53.565
Hit "ignore."

06:53.633 --> 06:55.801
Look, she's going to
musicfest this weekend.

06:55.869 --> 06:57.970
Yeah, as are half
the kids in dc. So?

06:58.037 --> 07:01.006
So it's a breeding ground
for negative group behavior.

07:01.074 --> 07:02.174
Drinking, drugs.

07:02.242 --> 07:03.609
Loker, I've been to musicfest.

07:03.676 --> 07:05.244
You're blowing it
way out of proportion.

07:05.311 --> 07:06.912
Well, you're not 16 years old.

07:06.980 --> 07:09.515
Last year, 3 girls
got roofied and raped.

07:09.582 --> 07:10.782
You should read
some of the things

07:10.850 --> 07:13.085
that her so-called friends
are writing about doing there.

07:13.153 --> 07:15.821
I mean...If she were
my daughter, I would...

07:15.889 --> 07:17.589
you know, I should
give Lightman a heads-up.

07:17.657 --> 07:20.592
Look. How many friends does
Emily have on that site?

07:20.660 --> 07:21.827
500 or 600.

07:21.895 --> 07:23.428
Exactly. She probably
barely knows

07:23.496 --> 07:26.732
the kids who are writing all this
stuff on her site, if at all.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.300
Oh, God.
What'd you do?

07:29.135 --> 07:30.302
Nothing.

07:31.437 --> 07:33.238
Told her I might be
going to musicfest, too.

07:33.306 --> 07:35.007
What is wrong with you?

07:35.074 --> 07:36.575
We got a confession.

07:36.643 --> 07:37.643
Out of who?

07:37.710 --> 07:38.744
Duane Corey.
You know, the guy

07:38.811 --> 07:40.612
that security grabbed
after the shooting.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.248
Well, his cellmate came
forward about an hour ago.

07:43.316 --> 07:45.017
Says that Corey
was bragging about

07:45.084 --> 07:46.451
trying to kill the governor.

07:46.519 --> 07:47.920
Gave up his whole plan...

07:47.987 --> 07:49.788
weapon cache,
location, everything.

07:49.856 --> 07:51.423
An inmate with
nothing but incentive

07:51.491 --> 07:52.591
to lie about
Corey's confession.

07:52.659 --> 07:53.592
Yeah, well, Lightman thinks

07:53.660 --> 07:54.660
I should bring you two to come

07:54.727 --> 07:56.895
check this guy out
with me, so, let's go.

07:58.231 --> 07:59.831
I love politicians.

07:59.899 --> 08:01.333
I do.
I really do.

08:03.303 --> 08:04.469
Are you comfortable?

08:04.537 --> 08:05.637
Can we get on with this?

08:05.705 --> 08:07.005
Governor, try to
answer our questions

08:07.073 --> 08:08.907
with as much accuracy
as you can.

08:08.975 --> 08:11.543
Yes, I am comfortable
in this glass box.

08:11.611 --> 08:12.778
A man in your position.

08:12.845 --> 08:14.513
Correct.
Up in the polls.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.115
Survivor of
an assassination attempt.

08:17.183 --> 08:20.519
I would never exploit a
tragedy like this for a...

08:20.587 --> 08:22.554
Bullet bump. Yeah.

08:22.622 --> 08:25.224
See, now I said it,
so you don't have to.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.593
You're way off base,
Dr. Lightman.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.662
So, I have to ask,
why all the guilt, governor?

08:30.730 --> 08:32.097
A girl died.

08:33.399 --> 08:34.533
Looks more like fear to me.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.001
What you frightened of, eh?

08:36.068 --> 08:37.669
Someone tried to kill me
at that rally.

08:37.736 --> 08:39.504
Yeah, but a girl died instead.

08:39.572 --> 08:40.905
What was her name?

08:40.974 --> 08:42.908
Michelle. Daly.

08:42.976 --> 08:44.876
Separation of first
and last name.

08:44.944 --> 08:46.245
The personal with the formal.

08:46.312 --> 08:48.947
So, she wasn't just any old
girl to you, was she, governor,

08:49.015 --> 08:50.382
and don't tell me
that all depends on

08:50.450 --> 08:52.584
what my definition of "was' is.

08:52.652 --> 08:54.820
She was one of our
college volunteers.

08:54.887 --> 08:56.255
It was no secret she knew me.

08:56.322 --> 08:57.789
How well would you say
you knew her?

08:57.857 --> 08:59.358
Ahh. Hardly at all.

08:59.425 --> 09:00.826
We might've made small talk.

09:00.893 --> 09:02.261
Might've?
And it could've been

09:02.328 --> 09:03.428
more than just small talk.

09:03.496 --> 09:07.099
It wasn't. Declarative.
Commanding.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.600
You wanted to make
sure it was never

09:08.668 --> 09:10.402
more than just small talk.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.037
You sure it wasn't pillow talk?

09:12.105 --> 09:13.872
Absolutely not.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.074
Clarifying language.
Defensive.

09:16.142 --> 09:17.009
There was a misunderstanding

09:17.076 --> 09:18.777
that could've
been misconstrued.

09:18.845 --> 09:20.746
Wires were crossed.

09:20.813 --> 09:24.449
Governor, man to man, right,
and Foster here.

09:25.451 --> 09:29.388
Michelle was a beautiful woman.

09:29.455 --> 09:32.724
Now, I know what it's like
to work with beautiful women.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.693
He's talking about
your friend Clara Musso.

09:34.761 --> 09:36.662
Yeah, and her, yeah.

09:36.729 --> 09:38.930
We both know that
there are women out there

09:38.998 --> 09:42.834
that are naturally
attracted to power.

09:43.836 --> 09:47.572
So, governor, out with it.

09:57.517 --> 09:59.584
There was one night
a few months ago.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.487
I had just won the primary.

10:02.555 --> 10:05.457
Alcohol was flowing and
I'd had a few drinks.

10:05.525 --> 10:07.059
It had been a rough campaign.

10:08.161 --> 10:10.262
My wife had headed home early.

10:10.330 --> 10:13.799
Ah. That seems like
the night in question.

10:13.866 --> 10:17.369
Michelle and I wound up
smoking a cigarette together.

10:17.437 --> 10:18.470
Shared it.

10:18.538 --> 10:20.439
She complimented me on my win.

10:20.506 --> 10:22.040
We talked for a long time.

10:23.543 --> 10:25.077
Stealing away like that...

10:26.279 --> 10:29.548
It made me feel young.
It was innocent.

10:29.615 --> 10:31.383
But not to Michelle.

10:31.451 --> 10:33.985
She was confused that
my wife had left early

10:34.053 --> 10:35.721
and here was the governor

10:35.788 --> 10:39.591
enjoying the taste of
a young woman's lipstick

10:39.659 --> 10:41.893
on the filter of a cigarette.

10:41.961 --> 10:45.864
We both know that this
isn't about a confusion

10:45.932 --> 10:48.867
of a young woman anymore,
don't we?

10:48.935 --> 10:53.071
You had sex with her.
That night. Admit it.

11:08.524 --> 11:09.458
It was one of those moments.

11:09.525 --> 11:11.793
Everyone celebrating,
schmoozing,

11:12.661 --> 11:16.530
and here she is, showing
me such simple, sure...

11:16.598 --> 11:18.199
yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.934
You took advantage
of her, didn't you?

11:20.002 --> 11:21.168
Nothing happened.

11:22.671 --> 11:24.538
Yet you were ashamed.
Why is that?

11:25.741 --> 11:26.874
Trevor Addison walked in

11:26.942 --> 11:29.377
before I could do
anything I'd regret.

11:29.444 --> 11:30.678
If he hadn't...

11:31.980 --> 11:35.049
He and I decided then to
distance Michelle from me.

11:35.117 --> 11:36.651
He reassigned her.

11:37.619 --> 11:39.086
Why keep her around at all?

11:39.154 --> 11:41.856
I wasn't about to cut
a promising career short

11:41.923 --> 11:46.594
just because I almost...
Could have...

11:46.662 --> 11:48.062
Crossed the line.

11:58.407 --> 12:00.741
Your future president's
more lucky than good.

12:00.809 --> 12:02.209
He didn't cheat,

12:02.277 --> 12:04.078
and he had no reason
to have her killed.

12:04.146 --> 12:05.146
Could we just
leave him alone now?

12:05.213 --> 12:06.614
He's explained his actions

12:06.682 --> 12:08.416
but not the others who
work on his behalf.

12:08.483 --> 12:11.252
He's a governor, Gillian,
not a mob boss.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.022
Oh, that sounds like a much
better campaign slogan

12:15.090 --> 12:16.724
than "no more
excuses."

12:18.794 --> 12:20.061
I didn't do it.

12:21.096 --> 12:23.230
Corey, come on, man.

12:23.298 --> 12:24.899
They found your gun
right there on the scene

12:24.966 --> 12:26.267
when they took you down.

12:26.335 --> 12:27.868
You were caught
red-handed.

12:27.936 --> 12:30.938
I'm telling you, it's not mine.

12:31.006 --> 12:32.373
So,
what are you saying?

12:32.441 --> 12:34.475
Well, it's a conspiracy.

12:34.543 --> 12:37.211
To frame you for
the murder of Michelle daly.

12:37.279 --> 12:38.379
I didn't kill her.

12:38.447 --> 12:40.314
You didn't
mean to kill her,

12:40.382 --> 12:42.350
because you were aiming
for the governor, right?

12:43.985 --> 12:45.720
There. Right there.
What you just did with your nostrils,

12:45.787 --> 12:48.356
that tells me that you want
governor Brooks dead.

12:48.423 --> 12:50.591
I didn't shoot that girl,

12:50.659 --> 12:52.093
and that gun is not mine.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.427
Stop lying.

12:53.495 --> 12:55.262
I'm not.
I'm innocent.

13:00.936 --> 13:02.370
I believe him.

13:02.437 --> 13:04.271
That's fear.
Of this place.

13:05.474 --> 13:06.941
Same as his.

13:07.008 --> 13:08.709
What?
Corey didn't do this.

13:08.777 --> 13:10.711
Don't you understand?
He already said that he did, though.

13:10.779 --> 13:12.747
Yeah, to his cellmate,
which, by the way,

13:12.814 --> 13:14.148
why did you say that, Corey?

13:14.216 --> 13:15.783
They think twice about raping

13:15.851 --> 13:17.518
cold-blooded killers
in here.

13:18.687 --> 13:21.622
And you really believe
that he didn't do this?

13:21.690 --> 13:23.057
I know he didn't.

13:25.727 --> 13:27.628
Take us back to
the night of the primary.

13:29.998 --> 13:31.499
No messenger on that.
Take it over in person.

13:31.566 --> 13:33.267
Get a signature.
Thank you.

13:33.335 --> 13:34.635
The night of the primary.

13:34.703 --> 13:36.504
When you found
the governor celebrating

13:36.571 --> 13:38.038
privately with Michelle.

13:38.106 --> 13:39.940
Yeah, that night
of the primary.

13:40.008 --> 13:41.041
I handled
the situation.

13:41.109 --> 13:42.610
I spoke with Michelle
and found her

13:42.677 --> 13:43.978
a more suitable position.

13:44.045 --> 13:45.146
So, one chat with you

13:45.213 --> 13:46.480
and she was out of
the inner circle.

13:46.548 --> 13:48.649
It's my job to insulate
the governor.

13:48.717 --> 13:50.584
Very smooth.
Hence the strut.

13:50.652 --> 13:52.219
Or is that
just like a side effect

13:52.287 --> 13:54.588
of being around all this
office Totty? Eh?

13:55.991 --> 13:57.258
So, how long did it take you

13:57.325 --> 13:59.059
to get Michelle
in the sack, then?

14:02.397 --> 14:04.465
I'm a single man,
Dr. Lightman.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.000
I work 100-hour weeks.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.102
Michelle was a beautiful,
young woman.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.136
What, you mean to tell me

14:09.204 --> 14:10.538
that neither of you
have ever been tempted

14:10.605 --> 14:12.106
to mix business with pleasure?

14:12.174 --> 14:13.741
Excuse me, but the woman
you were sleeping with

14:13.809 --> 14:15.709
was killed on your
campaign trail.

14:16.945 --> 14:19.180
You don't seem
too shaken up by that.

14:20.482 --> 14:22.950
I cut Michelle's family
a check for funeral expenses.

14:23.018 --> 14:24.018
Oh, that's nice of you.

14:24.085 --> 14:25.586
To get through
the terrible days ahead.

14:25.654 --> 14:27.955
Now, if you don't mind...
see that clock over there?

14:28.023 --> 14:30.391
19 hours until the polls
open... and counting.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.794
I've got a question for you.

14:33.862 --> 14:35.496
Ahem. You know
the man

14:35.564 --> 14:38.966
that was arrested
for the shooting, right?

14:39.034 --> 14:40.801
How does a nutter like that

14:40.869 --> 14:42.903
get through your security?

14:48.410 --> 14:51.445
I like a man who can own up to
his own mistakes, don't you?

14:51.513 --> 14:53.047
He cut a check.

14:55.484 --> 14:57.985
Now you think Addison
had Michelle killed?

14:58.053 --> 15:00.221
Well, you know, he
used to be a lobbyist

15:00.288 --> 15:02.623
for security contractors.

15:05.193 --> 15:06.994
Ok, so Addison's
sleeping with Michelle,

15:07.062 --> 15:08.229
and let's say,
for whatever reason,

15:08.296 --> 15:09.230
he wanted to have her killed.

15:09.297 --> 15:10.764
Why do it in such a public way?

15:10.832 --> 15:12.666
Well, it's two birds
with one bullet.

15:12.734 --> 15:15.569
Michelle's a goner
and Brooks is a winner.

15:15.637 --> 15:17.938
He gets one of his black
ops buddies to do the job.

15:18.006 --> 15:19.139
No one's the wiser.

15:19.207 --> 15:21.876
It's absurd, Cal.
He's not that kind of man.

15:22.911 --> 15:25.045
So, what kind of a man
is he, exactly?

15:28.917 --> 15:31.018
He's tried it on
with you, hasn't he?

15:31.086 --> 15:32.186
Please.

15:32.254 --> 15:34.321
Eyes front, Clara.
This is important.

15:38.059 --> 15:39.326
Hasn't he?

15:43.298 --> 15:45.099
Well, I can't say
as I blame him, really.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.334
Excuse me?

15:47.402 --> 15:49.370
That was supposed to be
a compliment.

15:49.437 --> 15:51.405
Compliment.
That's funny.

15:51.473 --> 15:53.340
It felt more like an insult.

15:53.408 --> 15:55.509
He's a player.

15:55.577 --> 15:58.345
Women like Michelle
are just a number to him.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.014
You mean women like
Michelle and me.

16:00.081 --> 16:01.949
No, because you
turned him down, right?

16:03.418 --> 16:05.152
See? I told you
I was good at this.

16:06.421 --> 16:08.322
Now, I don't think that
Michelle was the only woman

16:08.390 --> 16:10.558
that he was polling
on the campaign trail.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.793
The Brooks campaign has tons
of women working for it.

16:12.861 --> 16:14.461
Let's not start a witch hunt.

16:14.529 --> 16:17.898
Witch hunt.
Is that what you call them?

16:35.126 --> 16:38.828
Oy! Lemmings.
All right.

16:38.896 --> 16:42.532
Who here, apart from
Michelle daly,

16:42.600 --> 16:45.969
has been shagging
the chief of staff?

16:55.312 --> 16:57.013
Bingo. Lady in pink.

17:00.684 --> 17:02.352
What made you suspect
that Michelle and Addison

17:02.420 --> 17:03.920
were also having an affair?

17:03.988 --> 17:06.723
She went from part-time
volunteer to paid staff.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.723
Came out of nowhere.

17:07.791 --> 17:08.892
So, you see the advantage

17:08.959 --> 17:10.059
of sleeping with
Addison, right?

17:10.127 --> 17:11.560
You know how the game's played?

17:11.628 --> 17:13.630
But Michelle wasn't
a game player, was she?

17:13.696 --> 17:14.931
Michelle was wholesome.

17:14.999 --> 17:17.800
What? Meaning she was
naive and innocent?

17:17.867 --> 17:19.402
She wore a promise ring.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.671
Planned on saving herself
for whatever.

17:21.739 --> 17:24.174
"Whatever," said with
an edge of contempt.

17:25.175 --> 17:26.409
She was a good person.

17:29.814 --> 17:33.316
See, you had to control
every muscle in your body

17:33.384 --> 17:35.251
from your head to your toes
to pull that one off.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.187
It's true.
I don't doubt it.

17:37.254 --> 17:39.489
I'm talking about the
anger you feel for her.

17:39.557 --> 17:41.458
As if she's to blame
for you being here

17:41.525 --> 17:42.926
in the hot seat with us.

17:46.297 --> 17:50.900
How does Addison
get a promise ring

17:50.968 --> 17:52.569
off a girl like that, eh?

17:52.636 --> 17:54.804
We all partied just as
hard as we worked.

17:54.872 --> 17:56.072
She wanted to fit in.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.640
She started off with
just the occasional

17:57.708 --> 17:59.108
small glass of wine.

17:59.176 --> 18:01.344
And then the wine
turns to spirits.

18:02.279 --> 18:04.314
It's ok.
We all make mistakes.

18:04.381 --> 18:07.083
Michelle was a grown woman.
An adult.

18:07.151 --> 18:08.518
I did not make her drink.

18:08.586 --> 18:11.554
I did not steer her
towards trevor... addison.

18:14.325 --> 18:17.894
You're doing everything you can

18:17.962 --> 18:20.129
to avoid the elephant
in the room, aren't you?

18:20.197 --> 18:23.666
Elephant in the room... why
a promising young woman

18:23.734 --> 18:25.034
was murdered.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.302
They were shooting
at the governor.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.871
Oh, you're a cop now, are you?

18:27.938 --> 18:29.105
They had to shoot
past the governor

18:29.173 --> 18:30.740
to get to Michelle.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.042
Let's treat it
as murder for now.

18:35.346 --> 18:39.315
See, there it is again.
Fear. And anger.

18:39.383 --> 18:40.517
I mean, I'd feel the same way

18:40.584 --> 18:42.418
if I felt I was being
forced into a lie.

18:42.486 --> 18:43.620
I haven't lied.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.055
Smart.
True, too, technically.

18:46.123 --> 18:48.691
Because you know how to
steer a conversation

18:48.759 --> 18:50.660
and you know how to lie by omission.

18:53.130 --> 18:54.464
I smell a cover-up.

18:56.133 --> 18:58.501
I've been there.
I've done that.

18:58.569 --> 18:59.969
I'm not involved.

19:00.037 --> 19:03.006
I mean, I hear things, but
I... I didn't do anything.

19:03.073 --> 19:04.841
Now what you're doing
is stonewalling.

19:04.909 --> 19:07.610
You've gone from
gossip to accomplice.

19:10.948 --> 19:13.149
After Michelle started
sleeping with Addison,

19:13.217 --> 19:15.218
she started drinking even more.

19:15.286 --> 19:16.786
At the commonwealth fundraiser
last month,

19:16.854 --> 19:18.421
she got totally bombed.

19:18.489 --> 19:20.623
And she threatened to go
public with the affair.

19:20.691 --> 19:22.659
Addison sent her home before
she could make a scene

19:22.726 --> 19:24.961
and she drove up a curb
where a man

19:25.029 --> 19:26.529
was collecting
bottles and cans.

19:26.597 --> 19:27.797
Said she didn't even realize

19:27.865 --> 19:29.265
she hit someone at first.

19:30.568 --> 19:32.101
So, it was a hit and run?

19:32.169 --> 19:33.703
Addison made her
turn herself in

19:33.771 --> 19:35.305
and then it just...

19:35.372 --> 19:37.340
and I have no direct
knowledge of a cover-up,

19:37.408 --> 19:39.809
but I'm guessing Addison
got the incident

19:39.877 --> 19:41.277
swept under the rug.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.380
And the man she hit?

19:44.448 --> 19:46.282
He died after a few days.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.185
A drunk staffer kills someone

19:49.253 --> 19:50.186
leading up to election,

19:50.254 --> 19:51.621
you want to make it go away.

19:51.689 --> 19:53.556
In a close election,
you want more than that.

19:53.624 --> 19:56.159
You want the girl
to go away, right?

20:00.698 --> 20:01.631
You know,
a couple of my agents

20:01.699 --> 20:03.299
found your little hideout.

20:03.367 --> 20:06.903
The guns. Ammunition.

20:06.971 --> 20:10.039
Plus, the crosshairs
you drew on Brooks's photo

20:10.107 --> 20:12.075
speaks to malicious intent.

20:12.142 --> 20:14.377
I bought those
to protect the governor.

20:14.445 --> 20:15.878
Brooks was in danger.

20:15.946 --> 20:17.580
Yeah, well, I'd have
to agree with you on that.

20:17.648 --> 20:19.849
You don't understand.
I sent those e-mails

20:19.917 --> 20:21.684
so the staffers would
tighten up security.

20:21.752 --> 20:25.788
They're not real.
Brooks... he needs a guardian.

20:26.624 --> 20:27.857
Someone like me.

20:27.925 --> 20:30.126
Right, right.
Duane, let me explain something to you.

20:30.194 --> 20:31.894
You can try and play
crazy for the jury.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.663
That's not gonna fly in here.

20:35.199 --> 20:36.633
From your collection.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.568
What the hell?

20:38.636 --> 20:41.137
He doesn't even recognize
the murder weapon.

20:41.205 --> 20:43.806
Hey! This should be
in an evidence room.

20:43.874 --> 20:45.642
Can you playback?

20:45.709 --> 20:47.377
Yeah.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.548
There. Instant
genuine surprise.

20:52.616 --> 20:54.384
He's never seen it before.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.152
Because it ain't mine.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.655
Does he want Brooks
dead? Yes.

20:58.722 --> 20:59.989
Is he dangerous?
You bet?

21:00.057 --> 21:01.491
All right, so then
he's delusional.

21:01.558 --> 21:03.526
He thinks he's got a special
relationship with the governor.

21:03.594 --> 21:04.994
The gun's a throwaway.

21:05.062 --> 21:06.696
It's not that hard to file
numbers off a handgun,

21:06.764 --> 21:09.032
and anybody could have just planted it
near Corey the day of the shooting.

21:09.099 --> 21:10.333
The guy's a patsy.

21:10.401 --> 21:12.035
Yeah, well, he's gonna be
in here on gun charges.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.603
So, regardless, he's
gonna have to sit tight

21:13.671 --> 21:15.104
till we can figure
this thing out.

21:15.172 --> 21:17.607
So, whoever killed Michelle could
have known about Corey's threats,

21:17.675 --> 21:19.609
made sure he had a clear path to
Brooks on the day of the shooting

21:19.677 --> 21:22.345
so they could pin it
on a wacko.

21:28.185 --> 21:30.620
Just a minute!

21:30.688 --> 21:32.355
Oh, hang on.

21:38.195 --> 21:39.362
Hello.

21:40.864 --> 21:44.067
So, did he send you over here to
appeal to my better judgment?

21:44.134 --> 21:45.401
No, he didn't.

21:45.469 --> 21:48.571
That's good, 'cause
I've done everything.

21:48.639 --> 21:51.307
That's what I told him.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.143
You hungry?

21:54.211 --> 21:55.645
Oh, you cook, too?

21:55.713 --> 21:57.146
Oh, yeah.

21:57.214 --> 21:59.015
Sure.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.583
There's chicken masala.

22:00.651 --> 22:02.085
Mmm!

22:02.152 --> 22:04.220
So, be warned.

22:05.656 --> 22:07.590
Do you want a beer?
Sure.

22:07.658 --> 22:10.593
You know, I told the governor
that I owe my freedom

22:10.661 --> 22:13.096
to your bull-headed,
obnoxious,

22:13.163 --> 22:15.098
no-holds-barred way
of doing things.

22:16.667 --> 22:17.600
Up yours.

22:17.668 --> 22:19.102
Right now?

22:19.169 --> 22:21.337
Ooh, I say.

22:25.109 --> 22:26.776
So, how's he doing, then?

22:26.844 --> 22:28.111
The governor, I mean.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.513
You know, behind closed doors.

22:30.581 --> 22:32.115
He's distraught.
We all are

22:32.182 --> 22:33.783
for Michelle and her family,

22:33.851 --> 22:35.618
not just for his
political career.

22:35.686 --> 22:37.086
Oh, yeah.

22:37.154 --> 22:39.622
He's not broken up enough to pull
out of the race, though, is he?

22:39.690 --> 22:41.124
Oh, come on.
A life of service

22:41.191 --> 22:43.126
is all Brooks has
ever believed in.

22:43.193 --> 22:44.560
Ought to clean house.

22:44.628 --> 22:46.629
You're talking about Trevor
Addison, the campaign manager,

22:46.697 --> 22:48.464
on the eve of an election.

22:48.532 --> 22:51.033
No, I'm not. I'm talking about
the governor doing right

22:51.101 --> 22:53.136
by that girl's family, you
know, and by the voters.

22:53.203 --> 22:54.637
Excuse me.

22:54.705 --> 22:55.638
Excuse me.

22:55.706 --> 22:57.373
Excused.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.011
Thank you.

23:02.079 --> 23:03.579
Well, I'm here to tell you

23:03.647 --> 23:06.082
that he wants you to find
the truth, no matter what.

23:06.150 --> 23:08.084
Oh, what, so you appealed
to his better judgment,

23:08.152 --> 23:09.519
then, did you?

23:09.586 --> 23:12.321
... Like you,
he hasn't sp...

23:16.660 --> 23:18.327
too hot for you?

23:20.464 --> 23:22.331
It's good.
It's good.

23:24.668 --> 23:27.603
Would you like another beer?

23:27.671 --> 23:29.105
Are you trying to get me drunk?

23:29.173 --> 23:31.107
Who, me?
Mmm.

23:31.175 --> 23:34.343
No. Never.
Absolutely not.

23:59.969 --> 24:02.203
I couldn't find
a recycling bin.

24:03.439 --> 24:07.208
We know about Michelle's hit and run.

24:08.944 --> 24:11.312
That man's death
was an awful tragedy.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.381
Yes, kind of tragedy that could
kill a political career,

24:13.449 --> 24:15.416
unless your name's
Kennedy, of course.

24:15.484 --> 24:17.685
I'm paid to manage situations, Dr.
Lightman.

24:17.753 --> 24:21.990
By squeezing the D.A. who's looking
for the governor's endorsement?

24:22.057 --> 24:23.324
It was an accident,

24:23.392 --> 24:25.893
and I tried to
minimize the damage.

24:25.961 --> 24:29.497
William Freeman.
That's the damage.

24:29.565 --> 24:33.501
Yep. The dead man, in
case you were interested.

24:33.569 --> 24:35.503
I know his name.

24:35.571 --> 24:39.507
After the accident, there was
nothing I could do for him.

24:39.575 --> 24:41.509
He was hit near a stop sign.

24:41.577 --> 24:44.445
It was very hard
to see at night.

24:44.513 --> 24:48.950
That almost looks
like genuine remorse.

24:49.018 --> 24:51.519
I'm sorry the man is dead.

24:51.587 --> 24:54.022
Must be a pain in the...
... I mean cover-ups.

24:54.089 --> 24:55.523
Managing them, you know.

24:55.591 --> 24:57.925
Look, Michelle was a kid at
the beginning of her career.

24:57.993 --> 25:01.896
I wasn't gonna let her go to prison
over a youthful indiscretion.

25:01.964 --> 25:03.698
Or let the press find out.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.702
All right.
Full disclosure.

25:07.770 --> 25:10.305
Check's in the mail.
You don't look fat in that dress.

25:10.372 --> 25:12.974
Robin spoke with me about
your conversation yesterday.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.976
I was gonna head to your
office after the polls close.

25:15.044 --> 25:16.477
With something that
might help you.

25:16.545 --> 25:17.879
After the polls closed.

25:17.946 --> 25:20.214
What I'm trying to
tell you is...

25:23.385 --> 25:25.720
Let Michelle daly
speak for herself.

25:27.890 --> 25:31.993
After my car hit the curb,

25:32.061 --> 25:34.329
I just...
I just took off,

25:34.396 --> 25:36.931
'cause I didn't know
what to do.

25:36.999 --> 25:40.935
And I didn't know
that I had hit someone.

25:41.003 --> 25:43.004
I really didn't.

25:43.072 --> 25:45.740
I was drunk.

25:47.376 --> 25:50.511
Unusually matter of fact for someone
on the heels of a traumatic event.

25:50.579 --> 25:53.948
No sadness.
No remorse at all.

25:54.016 --> 25:55.450
Yeah, I don't doubt that
she was drunk that night,

25:55.517 --> 25:58.019
but I don't think she
was driving that car.

25:58.087 --> 26:01.389
Her confession is pure fiction.

26:01.457 --> 26:04.459
She's covering up for somebody.

26:04.526 --> 26:08.463
Sad part is that whoever it was

26:08.530 --> 26:11.766
had her convinced she was
doing the right thing.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.968
Hey!
Eli, what's up?

26:14.036 --> 26:15.470
Hey!

26:15.537 --> 26:16.971
I was just thinking about you.

26:17.039 --> 26:17.972
You were?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.907
Yeah, and music fest.

26:19.975 --> 26:22.410
Yeah, I'm really
excited for p-funk.

26:22.478 --> 26:23.911
Yeah, well, you're an old soul.

26:23.979 --> 26:25.980
You're a very funky old soul.

26:26.048 --> 26:26.914
Thanks.

26:26.982 --> 26:28.649
I'm also a p-funk fan.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.418
Really?
Sure.

26:30.486 --> 26:32.487
So you're coming?

26:32.554 --> 26:35.990
Yes, if your dad
lets me off work in time.

26:36.058 --> 26:38.493
Cool. You can meet
my friends.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.994
Yeah, your friends.

26:40.062 --> 26:41.496
Sure, why not.

26:41.563 --> 26:42.430
Hey, listen to this.

26:42.498 --> 26:44.732
They haven't even
released it yet.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.503
That's great.

26:48.570 --> 26:51.005
Look, Em, sometimes
at these festivals,

26:51.073 --> 26:53.007
there can be a diffusion
of responsibility.

26:53.075 --> 26:54.942
You know, you must not
be that big of a p-funk fan

26:55.010 --> 26:58.012
'cause you do
want to hear this.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.449
I just mean that sometimes
inhibitions can go down.

27:01.517 --> 27:04.952
And something that may not have
normally happened could happen.

27:05.020 --> 27:08.189
Or, you know,
maybe... maybe it would.

27:10.025 --> 27:12.460
All right, these guys.

27:12.528 --> 27:15.463
Bad idea.
Keep your distance.

27:15.531 --> 27:17.965
Eli, I barely know them.

27:18.033 --> 27:19.901
Good. Then your
distance will be kept

27:19.968 --> 27:21.636
because from what I'm reading,

27:21.703 --> 27:23.971
these guys are bringing an
entire pharmacy to the concert.

27:24.039 --> 27:26.908
Ecstasy...Speed...
Roofies?

27:26.975 --> 27:29.410
And you're worried something
might happen to me?

27:29.478 --> 27:31.913
Well, I care about you, Em.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.714
You're sweet.

27:35.050 --> 27:35.983
Good.

27:36.051 --> 27:38.920
And I care about you,
too. Really.

27:38.987 --> 27:40.488
Good. So,
you'll be careful.

27:40.556 --> 27:42.990
So careful.
Just relax.

27:43.058 --> 27:44.492
Ok.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.861
Em, God, no, no.

27:46.929 --> 27:49.497
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just...

27:49.565 --> 27:51.999
you kept IMing me
and... never mind.

27:52.067 --> 27:55.236
I was IMing you back
to be polite.

27:57.473 --> 28:00.741
No, Em, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like...

28:05.447 --> 28:07.682
I'm so fired.

28:12.454 --> 28:14.388
This a bit previous, isn't it?

28:14.456 --> 28:16.057
Polls haven't even closed yet.

28:16.124 --> 28:17.358
If you're looking
for my husband,

28:17.426 --> 28:19.961
he's at a press op
for the next few hours.

28:20.028 --> 28:21.963
Is that the one where they
go in the little booth

28:22.030 --> 28:23.564
and they vote for themselves?

28:23.632 --> 28:25.967
That's the one.

28:26.034 --> 28:28.970
Something I said?

28:29.037 --> 28:33.140
We don't believe Addison's
story about the hit and run.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.943
What hit and run?

28:38.547 --> 28:40.481
What was that?
What?

28:40.549 --> 28:42.650
What was that between you just now?
What was that?

28:42.718 --> 28:44.018
Nothing.

28:44.086 --> 28:45.920
You should really leave the
lying to the politician's wife.

28:45.988 --> 28:48.189
She's had a lot more
practice than you have.

28:48.257 --> 28:49.991
We believe that
Michelle took the fall

28:50.058 --> 28:51.826
in order to cover
for someone else.

28:51.894 --> 28:53.995
Someone else?

28:54.062 --> 28:57.431
How much did the governor have to
drink the night of the fundraiser?

28:57.499 --> 28:58.833
What?

28:58.901 --> 29:00.935
No, no, 'cause I can see
he likes to drink.

29:01.003 --> 29:02.370
I can see that much.

29:02.437 --> 29:05.406
I won't stand here while you
throw darts in the dark,

29:05.474 --> 29:08.442
indict my friends and my husband
with your pseudo-science.

29:08.510 --> 29:12.113
Look, Mrs. Brooks.
Michelle Bailey admitted to a hit and run

29:12.180 --> 29:15.383
that she had absolutely
nothing to do with.

29:15.450 --> 29:17.218
And now she's dead.

29:17.286 --> 29:18.819
And you are a bully,

29:18.887 --> 29:20.755
digging through a
decent man's trash.

29:20.822 --> 29:24.692
No one's perfect.
You'll find lies wherever you look.

29:26.028 --> 29:28.095
How about you, darling?
Hmm?

29:28.163 --> 29:30.464
How'd you get home that night?
'Cause you were there, weren't you?

29:30.532 --> 29:32.466
Yes, that was the night
I spilled wine on my dress.

29:32.534 --> 29:35.469
Red wine. Pinot.
Argentinian.

29:35.537 --> 29:36.971
What vintage?

29:37.039 --> 29:38.973
Nothing special.

29:39.041 --> 29:41.342
You see, like I said, we should
really leave the lying to her,

29:41.410 --> 29:44.478
'cause she's much better
at it than you are.

29:44.546 --> 29:45.980
Actually, Jenna and I
left together.

29:46.048 --> 29:48.215
I dropped her off at her house.

29:53.088 --> 29:54.922
Janet's using Clara.

29:54.990 --> 29:56.490
You're incredible.

29:56.558 --> 29:58.993
Or the other way
around, you know.

29:59.061 --> 30:00.161
Incredible how?

30:00.228 --> 30:01.395
You know.
Oh, Clara.

30:01.463 --> 30:03.164
It's that obvious, is it?

30:03.231 --> 30:04.999
Was it that good?

30:05.067 --> 30:07.335
Honestly?
No.

30:07.402 --> 30:09.503
'Cause that's what they were
doing when we showed up.

30:09.571 --> 30:11.005
They were getting
their stories straight.

30:11.073 --> 30:12.506
The pinot noir.

30:12.574 --> 30:15.009
Yeah, I mean, do they
even make that in Argentina?

30:15.077 --> 30:17.511
Alfredo Roca, 2007.

30:17.579 --> 30:19.013
Not just a pretty
face, are you?

30:19.081 --> 30:20.514
Back to you and Clara.

30:20.582 --> 30:21.449
Really?

30:21.516 --> 30:22.950
Well, she's up to something,

30:23.018 --> 30:24.518
and I want to make sure
you're not compromised.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.020
No, no, it was just a
bit of fun between us.

30:26.088 --> 30:27.388
It was a little
bit more than that.

30:27.456 --> 30:28.456
Were you there?

30:28.523 --> 30:30.958
I'm talking about
from her perspective.

30:31.026 --> 30:33.527
You don't read faces, do you?

30:33.595 --> 30:35.529
Did I say incredible?
I meant impossible.

30:35.597 --> 30:36.931
Thank you very much.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.138
Let's say that Clara
was driving the car

30:41.606 --> 30:43.040
and she ran over
the homeless guy.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.408
Are you accusing Clara?

30:44.475 --> 30:46.543
No, it's just theory.
I'm just posing a theory.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.546
The Brooks campaign might feel
obligated to help cover it up.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.049
She is their biggest
campaign donor.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.786
Hey. I need to
talk to you in private.

30:58.556 --> 30:59.990
Yeah, what is it?

31:00.058 --> 31:03.827
So, it started... Emily, she
friended me on this website.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.996
Hurry up, 'cause I
haven't got much time.

31:06.064 --> 31:10.000
Right. I was worried about
these drugs, these boys...

31:10.068 --> 31:12.002
excuse me?

31:12.070 --> 31:13.503
Uh...

31:13.571 --> 31:16.006
I just felt that somebody
should be looking out for her.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.508
Oh, really?

31:18.576 --> 31:21.011
I...

31:21.079 --> 31:23.747
I just think...
Emily kissed me.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.250
Follow me.

31:35.092 --> 31:37.026
So, you kissed my daughter.

31:37.094 --> 31:40.363
No. No. She put her
headphones on me in the lab.

31:40.431 --> 31:41.531
I wanted to show her...

31:41.599 --> 31:42.865
you kissed my daughter.

31:42.933 --> 31:45.034
No, I was trying to help,
and she kissed me.

31:45.102 --> 31:47.036
How was it for you?
What?

31:47.104 --> 31:49.372
How was it for you? Was it good?
Did it feel good?

31:49.440 --> 31:52.542
No. I mean, I just was
trying to help her out.

31:52.610 --> 31:53.543
Oh!

31:55.112 --> 31:56.980
Enough said.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.216
What, Reynolds?

32:01.885 --> 32:05.054
I guess Addison won't be around
to see the governor be re-elected.

32:05.122 --> 32:07.223
All right, guys, come on.
Everybody out. Let's go.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.996
He's not the suicide type.

32:13.063 --> 32:15.265
Yeah, well,
he wrote the suicide note.

32:15.332 --> 32:17.567
He e-mailed everyone
on the governor's staff.

32:17.635 --> 32:20.003
He admits to covering up
Michelle's hit and run

32:20.070 --> 32:23.239
and that he hired the shooter to
kill her before she could talk.

32:24.508 --> 32:26.376
Now we have to figure
out who wrote this.

32:26.443 --> 32:28.244
Yeah, 'cause he didn't.

32:35.386 --> 32:36.919
Hey, you seen Lightner?

32:36.987 --> 32:39.022
He's in his office
waiting for Clara.

32:39.089 --> 32:41.457
Ha. Still fighting
that fight, huh?

32:41.525 --> 32:44.193
Don't let him fool
you. He loves it.

32:44.261 --> 32:45.561
Let me ask you something.

32:45.629 --> 32:48.531
How can you tell if this thing
is fake if it's been typed?

32:48.599 --> 32:50.033
Word choice, repetition.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.035
The use of passive or active
voice can tell you a lot

32:52.102 --> 32:54.037
about the person
who wrote this.

32:54.104 --> 32:56.105
Let me show you.

32:56.173 --> 32:59.042
"A person of my stature",
"someone in my position",

32:59.109 --> 33:00.710
"with regards to
a subordinate"...

33:00.778 --> 33:04.480
this is a person who is preoccupied
with power and status.

33:04.548 --> 33:05.982
Power and status, huh?

33:06.050 --> 33:08.384
That sounds like the Trevor Addison
you were describing earlier.

33:08.452 --> 33:10.987
It's all about the pronouns.

33:11.055 --> 33:14.991
Women. We use a lot more
pronouns when we write.

33:15.059 --> 33:17.393
"I", "she," "they."

33:17.461 --> 33:20.997
Men will typically name the person
or thing they're talking about.

33:21.065 --> 33:24.500
So a woman preoccupied with
power and status wrote this.

33:24.568 --> 33:26.235
Yep.

33:29.573 --> 33:31.240
Why?

33:34.011 --> 33:36.012
Why, it's all there.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.948
He covered up
for the hit and runs.

33:39.016 --> 33:41.517
You don't believe that, do you?

33:41.585 --> 33:43.453
Another thing or two
about suicides...

33:43.520 --> 33:46.322
slippery sorts like Addison,
they don't kill themselves.

33:46.390 --> 33:48.324
What, you think
he was murdered?

33:48.392 --> 33:52.462
Michelle and Addison, they both knew
something that got them killed.

33:52.529 --> 33:56.199
I just hope to hell that you
don't know what they knew, love.

33:58.469 --> 34:01.871
You already know
I do, don't you?

34:01.939 --> 34:05.208
You didn't drive
Janet home that night.

34:06.977 --> 34:09.545
You weren't even
in the bloody car.

34:14.551 --> 34:17.219
Janet killed that homeless man.

34:18.554 --> 34:20.489
She was alone.
It was an accident.

34:20.556 --> 34:22.992
She was drunk.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.494
Addison made Michelle
take the blame,

34:24.561 --> 34:26.829
and then he pulled some
strings to make it go away.

34:26.897 --> 34:28.398
All except Michelle,
and that let loose.

34:28.465 --> 34:30.500
That got taken care
of yesterday, didn't it?

34:30.567 --> 34:31.934
Janet and I go way back.

34:32.002 --> 34:33.936
If she knew anything about
Michelle's death, I would...

34:34.004 --> 34:35.438
you'd know?

34:35.505 --> 34:36.938
She'd tell you, right?

34:37.007 --> 34:39.675
Even though you're the major
stakeholder in this firm?

34:42.079 --> 34:45.748
That suicide note
was written by a woman.

34:54.658 --> 34:56.092
Shake.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.460
You lied to me.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.462
You covered up for the governor's
wife at the 11th hour.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.963
I want my firm back.

35:01.031 --> 35:02.465
She picked me earlier today.

35:02.533 --> 35:04.467
She just needed
a little more time.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.902
Shake his hand.

35:05.969 --> 35:07.703
I'll be your witness.

35:11.942 --> 35:16.179
You know, these people... they
don't deserve your loyalty.

35:16.246 --> 35:19.982
I think you're
better than that.

35:20.050 --> 35:23.219
I want to give you
a chance to prove it.

35:56.050 --> 35:57.650
What are you doing here?

35:57.718 --> 36:01.421
I told them. Addison
left too many loose ends.

36:01.488 --> 36:03.656
I don't want to be
involved anymore.

36:03.724 --> 36:09.228
Honey, no one's going to take
Clara's word over yours.

36:10.564 --> 36:12.432
Addison forced Michelle
to keep his secret.

36:12.499 --> 36:15.435
When she wouldn't,
he had her killed.

36:15.502 --> 36:17.003
She's lying.

36:17.071 --> 36:18.504
Can you prove it?

36:18.572 --> 36:20.006
Yes.

36:20.074 --> 36:21.507
The night of the fundraiser.

36:21.575 --> 36:24.544
Addison rode home in my limo.
You can ask my driver.

36:24.611 --> 36:27.513
Governor Brooks, Michelle
wasn't driving the car

36:27.581 --> 36:29.515
that was involved
in the hit and run.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.184
She took the fall
for someone else.

36:31.251 --> 36:34.487
Well, it wasn't Addison, and
it certainly wasn't me.

36:34.555 --> 36:37.523
Addison's suicide note
was written by a woman.

36:37.591 --> 36:39.258
It was a fake.

36:41.962 --> 36:44.130
Well, it could have been Clara.

36:47.101 --> 36:51.204
Where were you the night of
the hit and run, Mrs. Brooks?

36:53.107 --> 36:56.876
Well, Clara gave me a ride
home from the fundraiser.

36:56.944 --> 37:00.446
See, even he doesn't
believe that one.

37:02.549 --> 37:04.484
Congratulations, governor.

37:04.551 --> 37:06.886
Charles, we have to leave now.

37:06.954 --> 37:10.089
Even you can't be that stupid.

37:10.157 --> 37:13.659
You must have sensed that
something was going wrong.

37:13.727 --> 37:15.128
They said it was nothing.

37:15.195 --> 37:16.496
The FBI are going through
your phone records

37:16.563 --> 37:18.498
and personal hard drives.

37:18.565 --> 37:20.500
Are they gonna find something
about the shooter?

37:20.567 --> 37:23.002
The shooter was
a crazed, lone gunman.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.504
Is it the same one
that you hired

37:24.571 --> 37:26.506
to take care of Addison
in the tub?

37:26.573 --> 37:28.508
I mean, are we gonna find him
sitting on the beach somewhere

37:28.575 --> 37:30.009
counting your money?

37:32.012 --> 37:36.015
Janet, is there any truth
to what they're saying?

37:36.083 --> 37:40.520
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

37:40.587 --> 37:43.523
Janet, what did you do?

37:43.590 --> 37:46.192
I was the one
holding it all together.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.527
I always have been.

37:47.594 --> 37:49.529
You always said
I was your rock.

37:49.596 --> 37:50.530
Oh, God.

37:50.597 --> 37:52.365
I was your rock, Charles.

37:52.432 --> 37:54.033
Charles.

37:54.101 --> 37:55.868
No!

37:55.936 --> 37:57.970
I didn't ask for this.

37:58.038 --> 38:02.475
Yeah, you did, actually, when
you stopped asking questions.

38:06.547 --> 38:08.981
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

38:09.049 --> 38:11.484
What can I do
to make this right?

38:11.552 --> 38:14.487
Well, you could
step down for starters.

38:14.555 --> 38:16.422
Personal reasons, whatever.

38:16.490 --> 38:18.224
I don't care.

38:23.497 --> 38:25.898
Your public's waiting
for you, governor.

38:44.585 --> 38:53.025
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech! Speech!

39:06.540 --> 39:08.975
We could be a good team.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.210
I got all the team I need.

39:12.579 --> 39:17.216
I know you respect the work
we do here, Clara, but sign.

39:19.987 --> 39:22.822
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

39:22.890 --> 39:25.892
Oh, that's an assassin's
gaze, if ever I saw one.

39:25.959 --> 39:28.728
You said there was
no such thing.

39:43.577 --> 39:44.744
Oy.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.014
Looking for this?

39:48.081 --> 39:50.016
What flavor is it?

39:50.083 --> 39:51.150
Pineapple.

39:51.218 --> 39:53.019
Yeah, it is here.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.021
So, you hit him?

39:55.088 --> 39:56.455
You kissed him.

39:56.523 --> 39:58.124
Now he'll never meddle again.

39:58.191 --> 40:01.527
I mean, he may sue you, but
at least he'll never meddle.

40:01.595 --> 40:03.129
So, what were you thinking?

40:03.196 --> 40:04.530
I don't know.

40:04.598 --> 40:06.766
Oh, that rings true.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.101
Maybe kissing him
was a little extreme.

40:09.169 --> 40:10.670
Oh, you reckon, do you?

40:10.737 --> 40:13.472
Yeah, but that makes me the apple
that didn't fall far from the tree.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.975
Oh, so, it's my
fault, then, is it?

40:16.043 --> 40:18.044
Yeah. It's good
you admit this.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.913
No, no, no, no.
My point is

40:20.981 --> 40:26.285
that it's not Loker's
fault, right?

40:27.955 --> 40:29.555
What?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.994
You didn't.

40:35.062 --> 40:38.798
You did, didn't you?

40:46.640 --> 40:47.807
Hi.

40:50.143 --> 40:56.949
I know you were just trying to
look out for her, right?

40:57.017 --> 41:01.020
And I shouldn't have hit you.

41:01.088 --> 41:03.522
I was wrong.

41:03.590 --> 41:05.758
Physical violence...

41:07.094 --> 41:11.263
Right... is very, very wrong.

41:12.899 --> 41:13.966
Apology accepted.

41:14.034 --> 41:16.268
Dad, come on.
Don't blow the apology.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.540
I'm sorry.

41:21.608 --> 41:24.543
Probably should have
seen it coming.

41:24.611 --> 41:26.045
What, the kiss?

41:26.113 --> 41:28.414
No, the punch.

41:28.482 --> 41:32.284
You're emotional wildfire
where Emily's concerned.

41:34.121 --> 41:36.989
Bit of ice cream?

41:37.057 --> 41:39.291
It's pineapple.

41:40.627 --> 41:42.294
I like beer.

41:43.630 --> 41:45.564
Go in. Help yourself.

41:45.632 --> 41:47.566
First on the left.

41:47.634 --> 41:49.301
Ok.

41:59.479 --> 42:01.347
What if I hadn't apologized?

42:01.415 --> 42:02.848
Ooh!

42:06.586 --> 42:07.520
Good girl.

42:07.587 --> 42:09.255
Good girl.
