02:19.105 --> 02:20.385
- Well, I guess not.
- All right.

02:20.459 --> 02:22.408
Why don't you head upstairs
and cool down, all right?

02:22.432 --> 02:23.439
Don't forget to stretch,
all right?

02:23.463 --> 02:25.235
- I won't!
- Okay.

Dad? It's morning!

02:38.849 --> 02:40.637
Bob: Uh, okay.
I need a few more minutes.

02:40.975 --> 02:42.785
I get the first shower!

02:48.424 --> 02:49.917
Joy: It's done now, Miles.

02:49.942 --> 02:51.253
Miles: How can you tell?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.588
Hey. Can you make me an omelet?

02:53.613 --> 02:54.760
- Uh, no.
- Why?

02:54.785 --> 02:56.979
You make Dad breakfast, like,
literally every morning.

02:57.004 --> 02:58.045
Dad pays the bills.

02:58.046 --> 02:59.280
You can have some of my bacon.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.391
No, Miles. No meat!

03:01.427 --> 03:02.859
It's done, Miles.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.898
I like it extra-crisp.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.913
Okay, now do you believe
that it's done?!

03:06.938 --> 03:08.390
Step away, the grease is hot.

03:08.415 --> 03:11.100
You gotta be kidding me!
What is wrong with you kids?!

03:11.125 --> 03:12.511
I told him to stop cooking.

03:12.536 --> 03:13.763
We wouldn't have this
kind of problem

03:13.787 --> 03:15.661
if the people in our family
didn't eat animal flesh.

03:15.685 --> 03:17.367
Oh, thank you, Mr. Gandhi.

03:17.392 --> 03:19.508
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

03:25.359 --> 03:28.570
Bob: Oh, I am gonna lose
my mind, Joy.

03:28.595 --> 03:29.446
- I got it.
- Please.

03:29.575 --> 03:31.220
Hey, you know what's
great for breakfast?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.055
I'll tell you what. Cereal.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.079
Yeah, you know why?

03:34.104 --> 03:36.149
It never catches on fire,
not once.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.411
Dad, it's batteries...
I'm pretty sure it's batteries.

03:37.435 --> 03:38.699
Thank you, thank you.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.715
Uh, future,
it's just the batteries.

03:44.518 --> 03:45.625
Bob: Joy...
Joy: I got it. Levi?

03:45.649 --> 03:47.027
Levi! Zip it!

03:49.343 --> 03:51.476
Thank you.

03:51.501 --> 03:52.484
Vitamins...

03:52.515 --> 03:53.313
Do we have donuts?

03:53.337 --> 03:55.148
Uh, no, but you can
take your vitamins.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.586
Here. Swallow.
Do I have to?!

03:57.636 --> 03:58.981
Chew. Ahhh.

03:59.777 --> 04:01.127
No cheating like last time,
okay?

04:01.194 --> 04:03.103
- Okay. Hey, Joy, Joy.
- Yes, Dad.

04:03.128 --> 04:05.244
I need you to take the dog
out for a walk

04:05.269 --> 04:09.013
and just make sure that he goes
number 1 and number 2.

04:09.038 --> 04:11.138
Why does it always have
to be me?

04:11.163 --> 04:13.817
- Because it's your dog.
- It's the family's dog.

04:13.842 --> 04:15.110
You picked him out.

04:15.135 --> 04:16.962
I was like four years old.

04:16.987 --> 04:18.821
Obviously, Mom technically
picked him out.

04:19.355 --> 04:21.685
Miles, sweetie, you do it!

04:21.832 --> 04:23.303
- Me?
- Yeah.

04:24.034 --> 04:26.022
I wasn't even born.

04:26.047 --> 04:27.772
He likes you best.

04:27.797 --> 04:30.136
It's just like number 1
and number 2.

04:30.991 --> 04:32.940
- Lucky me.
- Thank you.

04:33.282 --> 04:34.839
Both of you dress by the time
I come back.

04:34.863 --> 04:36.119
Levi! Let's go!

04:36.475 --> 04:37.310
Thank your sister.

04:37.335 --> 04:39.131
- Thank you, Joy!
- Thank you, Joy!

04:39.257 --> 04:41.646
Bob: Has anyone seen my keys?

04:42.760 --> 04:45.582
What took you so long?
Dad can't find his car keys!

04:45.607 --> 04:47.121
Okay, first of all,
inside voice.

04:47.146 --> 04:48.575
Second, he came home
in the wind breaker.

04:48.599 --> 04:49.840
Go check the pockets.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.246
We've got a car-key crisis!

04:51.271 --> 04:53.066
I know, I know.
Miles is on it.

04:53.241 --> 04:54.359
I got you the keys!

04:54.384 --> 04:56.413
- Ahh! Beautiful! Whoa!
- Ah, good!

04:56.448 --> 04:57.783
- Thank you.
- Backpack.

04:57.808 --> 05:00.005
- Zack! Zack!
- Let's go, let's go!

05:00.030 --> 05:01.906
No, that is not helping!

05:01.931 --> 05:03.087
Aw. Oh, that's the attitude.

05:03.150 --> 05:04.088
That's the winning attitude.

05:04.112 --> 05:06.142
Let's go, let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

05:08.161 --> 05:09.552
- You. Go, go, go.
- Dad!

05:09.577 --> 05:11.044
Don't you need this?

05:15.154 --> 05:17.188
Levi, you're in charge now.

05:18.843 --> 05:19.867
Hey, hey.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.220
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.590
Zack: Oh, Dad.
Bob: Shh. All right.

05:31.615 --> 05:33.324
Here you go. Do you mind?

05:33.615 --> 05:35.293
- Guess not.
- All right.

05:35.355 --> 05:37.619
- Did you get the car fixed?
- On my to do list.

05:37.644 --> 05:38.911
Joy: I was supposed to get
the front seat today.

05:38.935 --> 05:41.310
- I need that for work.
- I know, I'm bigger than you.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.125
Start!

05:49.804 --> 05:51.640
All little luck.

05:57.517 --> 06:00.081
I still don't see why you
guys don't carpool with her.

06:01.672 --> 06:04.363
Zack: The Wellmans aren't
our kind of people, buddy.

06:04.762 --> 06:06.784
What's that mean?

06:07.045 --> 06:09.410
Joy: She's way too cool for us.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.373
Bob: Oh come on,
who's cooler than us?

06:16.398 --> 06:17.416
Look at this.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.931
Oh! Cool car!

06:21.956 --> 06:22.880
All right, let's go.

06:22.905 --> 06:24.919
Ah, man.

06:24.944 --> 06:26.185
Can you please get a better car?

06:26.210 --> 06:27.567
I shouldn't have got cocky.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.103
Remember, I don't know you.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.608
Why should you be different than
the rest of the student body?

06:39.013 --> 06:40.443
So it was really fun
yesterday,

06:40.497 --> 06:42.763
I was racing my Dad
and letting him win.

06:46.471 --> 06:48.624
♪ Dreamer...

06:48.649 --> 06:52.371
♪ She thinks no one sees her

06:52.396 --> 06:55.605
♪ Hides behind her blue eyes

06:56.192 --> 06:59.410

07:03.985 --> 07:05.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:10.302 --> 07:12.776
Ugh. How can you drink those?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.718
I've been up all night.

07:15.072 --> 07:16.912
Wanna know Principal
Klozmier's credit score?

07:17.014 --> 07:20.492
No, thank you.
Hacking is illegal.

07:20.994 --> 07:23.384
See, your problem is you
think too much inside the box.

07:23.756 --> 07:26.922
Okay, that is not my problem.

07:27.094 --> 07:31.929
You see, while you are getting
bad posture and eye strain,

07:32.170 --> 07:35.422
I am activating the right brain
and the unconscious mind.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.344
Here. Take a card.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.471
My mom already read
my horoscope at breakfast.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.088
Oh, these card?
Nothing like that.

07:46.011 --> 07:47.529
They are equally ridiculous.

07:47.605 --> 07:50.654
The unconscious mind is
calling a lot of our shots.

07:59.324 --> 08:01.068
That's why I always get
the same card?

08:01.517 --> 08:03.084
If only...

08:04.341 --> 08:05.646
Later.

08:05.738 --> 08:06.834
Later.

08:19.444 --> 08:20.993
Joy: Tom Addison.

08:21.070 --> 08:24.587
Oh... He's so hot.

08:24.763 --> 08:27.997
He's totally perfect.

08:31.585 --> 08:35.759
He smells like my Grandma's
hot apple cider.

08:37.913 --> 08:39.947
Like you've been close enough
to smell him?

08:39.972 --> 08:43.360
Oh believe me,
it is a scent that travels.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.262
- Did that just happen?
- Uh-huh.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.887
- Oh, God. Okay.
- Walk.

09:13.060 --> 09:16.430
- Look what she's wearing.
- What does she think...

09:19.225 --> 09:20.265
What're you doing?

09:20.290 --> 09:23.196
Visualizing world peace.

09:23.221 --> 09:25.766
Just say the word and
I'll set Brie's hair on fire.

09:25.992 --> 09:27.364
Set her hair on fire.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.364
Well, I didn't mean literally.

09:29.642 --> 09:30.974
What did you mean?

09:31.114 --> 09:32.208
That I have your back.

09:32.449 --> 09:33.929
But as a concept.

09:34.751 --> 09:36.597
Mr. Elderberry: Greetings,
musicians.

09:37.079 --> 09:39.412
How's everybody doing
with the holiday tunes?

09:39.437 --> 09:40.323
- Good.
- Great.

09:40.348 --> 09:42.807
- Ooh, not too good.
- I don't really want to play.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.649
Oh... hmm.

09:45.674 --> 09:48.818
Okay... Joy?

09:48.843 --> 09:50.707
- Yes?
- Would you play for us?

09:50.832 --> 09:51.957
Of course.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.350
Ah, she wants to play
with Tom Addison.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.318
Especially if she can get her
hands on his instrument.

09:59.462 --> 10:00.589
Hair, now!

10:00.614 --> 10:02.004
Mr. Elderberry: That's enough,
Brie.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.137
Continue.

10:03.368 --> 10:04.085
Yes.

10:21.526 --> 10:23.854
Splendid. Splendid!

10:24.378 --> 10:25.829
I don't think you'll
be surprised

10:25.888 --> 10:27.403
that I want you to do the solo

10:27.428 --> 10:28.653
for the holiday concert.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.003
Ooh.

10:30.098 --> 10:33.737
Um, didn't Miss Hockstatter get her
turn at the Halloween assembly?

10:34.608 --> 10:36.829
You can't solo with
a triangle, Brie.

10:36.918 --> 10:39.887
Oh, I'm not talking about
myself, Mr. Elderberry.

10:39.912 --> 10:41.389
I just think some of the other
kids in the class

10:41.414 --> 10:42.817
should get a chance.

10:43.306 --> 10:44.681
Joy will do the solo.

10:44.706 --> 10:45.920
Continue.

10:45.945 --> 10:46.933
Okay...

10:53.283 --> 10:54.634
Zack: Joy! There you are!

10:54.659 --> 10:56.240
Hey, do you have your house key?

10:56.535 --> 10:58.317
Uh, no. I gave mine to Miles.

10:58.342 --> 11:00.005
Oh no! Well, it's Tuesday,

11:00.030 --> 11:01.438
so he's at Campfire Girls.

11:01.463 --> 11:02.985
- Cub Scouts.
- Same thing.

11:03.010 --> 11:03.844
No, it's not.

11:03.869 --> 11:06.703
Yeah, it is. Oh, you know
what this means, right?

11:08.005 --> 11:09.536
You're going to have to go
with the DD.

11:09.561 --> 11:11.776
- The what?
- The doggy door.

11:12.041 --> 11:14.984
No. No. I am too big
for that now.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.422
- You are not too big!
- Mm-mm.

11:16.447 --> 11:17.178
Look, it doesn't matter,

11:17.203 --> 11:18.203
you're gonna have to do it
anyways.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.625
Uh, no. I said no.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.090
Ah, well, if this door
is not open.

11:22.254 --> 11:23.298
Ha!

11:23.570 --> 11:26.444
Um, Dad should be home in
the next three to five hours,

11:26.469 --> 11:29.232
so you let me know when
you've come to your senses.

11:33.348 --> 11:35.237
- You know what we should do?
- What?

11:35.906 --> 11:39.768
You... should pick one.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.268
Yeah, no way.

11:41.778 --> 11:43.942
Don't you wanna know more
about your life?

11:43.967 --> 11:45.036
- My life?
- Yeah!

11:45.061 --> 11:46.567
My life. Now, let's see.

11:46.592 --> 11:49.114
We were born, we grew up,
mom croaked on us,

11:49.153 --> 11:51.536
and Dad has been having
a breakdown ever since.

11:51.950 --> 11:53.895
Which part did you miss?

11:54.084 --> 11:56.005
I just thought that...

11:56.521 --> 11:59.274
that you would be
interested in...

12:00.677 --> 12:03.243
"understanding your current
dilemmas."

12:03.268 --> 12:06.055
Our current dilemma,
little sister,

12:06.080 --> 12:07.863
is that we're locked outside.

12:08.119 --> 12:09.207
It doesn't matter how many times

12:09.232 --> 12:11.270
you deal those silly little
cards of yours.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.488
Change. I've gotten this one
twice today.

12:19.648 --> 12:21.523
You should put it in Miles's
underwear drawer.

12:21.548 --> 12:23.134
He needs a lot of reminders.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.384
Hmm...

12:26.696 --> 12:29.212
Family.

12:29.761 --> 12:32.136
If only it were
that easy.

12:32.594 --> 12:34.688
Now please, please...

12:34.713 --> 12:37.510
get your scrawny little butt
through the doggy door.

12:42.717 --> 12:46.090
Ugh! Levi! Levi!

12:46.115 --> 12:47.808
Don't! Levi! Ugh!

12:47.833 --> 12:50.273
Please! Levi, go! Go!

12:50.298 --> 12:53.117
Zack: You're doing fine.
Just keep going.

12:53.289 --> 12:56.320
Look, hey, why don't you just
try some of your yoga breathing.

12:56.566 --> 12:58.805
I don't do yoga!

12:58.979 --> 13:00.818
Well, you should!

13:00.948 --> 13:03.052
Ow! Not helping!

13:03.257 --> 13:05.068
Ungh! Ungh!

13:05.093 --> 13:08.162
I told you this wouldn't work!

13:10.252 --> 13:11.970
Zack!

13:14.394 --> 13:16.376
You look like a hunting
trophy.

13:16.401 --> 13:17.173
Huh?

13:19.202 --> 13:20.929
How did you get in here?

13:20.954 --> 13:22.825
Oh, I found a key.

13:23.940 --> 13:24.919
How'd you find the key?

13:24.944 --> 13:26.231
You remember the last time
this happened

13:26.256 --> 13:28.512
and you said I should probably
hide a key somewhere outside?

13:28.537 --> 13:29.399
Yeah.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.608
Well, I hid a key somewhere.

13:31.807 --> 13:33.202
That's really great.

13:33.289 --> 13:35.164
Now could you get me out?!

13:36.126 --> 13:37.758
What do I look like,
a fireman?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.717
Hey, bud.

14:01.987 --> 14:03.833
Another day down, huh?

14:04.807 --> 14:06.541
Another day down.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.233
Hmm.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.260
Mom...

14:48.665 --> 14:50.108
Do you have a sec?

14:57.295 --> 14:59.431
Hey.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.488
What's up?

15:01.513 --> 15:03.103
Are we getting a tree
this year?

15:04.474 --> 15:06.879
Wow. Uh, well, they're not
great for the environment.

15:06.904 --> 15:08.059
Plus they're expensive.

15:08.706 --> 15:10.065
I want a tree.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.903
It was Mom's favorite thing.

15:13.128 --> 15:16.193
Um, well, Mom had many
favorite things.

15:16.256 --> 15:20.351
Yeah, but...
she loved Christmas.

15:24.060 --> 15:26.731
Well, I don't, okay?

15:27.473 --> 15:30.222
Now, I need you to go back
to bed and go to sleep.

15:30.247 --> 15:31.768
It's past your bedtime.

15:32.330 --> 15:33.520
Okay.

15:34.507 --> 15:35.864
Sorry, Joy.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.328
Come here.

15:48.972 --> 15:50.795
Guess what?
What?

15:51.458 --> 15:55.541
We are going to get our very
own Christmas tree this year.

15:58.031 --> 16:00.811
I'll make sure of it.
Thanks.

16:01.832 --> 16:04.815
Now, go to sleep.
Take off your uniform.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.967
Don't make me ask you again,
okay?

16:05.992 --> 16:06.537
'Kay.

16:07.209 --> 16:09.311
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.240
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

16:17.121 --> 16:18.747
I just don't' understand why.

16:18.772 --> 16:21.208
What? Five dollars? It's not
like I have a money tree.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.354
- A money tree?!
- Yes, a money tree.

16:23.379 --> 16:24.962
- Let me see, you still have jelly on your face.
- No!

16:24.987 --> 16:27.095
You were supposed to brush
your teeth.

16:36.888 --> 16:39.223
Good news is you still look
half asleep.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.307
Bad news is
you're still a child.

16:41.405 --> 16:42.348
Ha.

16:44.198 --> 16:46.150
Oh NO! My clarinet!

16:46.908 --> 16:48.405
That's not my problem.

16:50.311 --> 16:52.316
Oh God! Dad?!

16:53.950 --> 16:55.077
Dad?

16:56.118 --> 16:57.420
Dad?!

16:57.678 --> 17:00.122
My clarinet's in the car!

17:01.117 --> 17:01.952
Okay.

17:04.821 --> 17:07.602
Dad! My clarinet's in the car!

17:22.652 --> 17:24.085
Dad, stop!

17:24.471 --> 17:27.001
Dad! Stop!

17:52.854 --> 17:54.216
What's going on?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.283
Joy, I'm so sorry!

17:56.308 --> 17:59.528
Okay, I'm so, so sorry!

18:01.048 --> 18:02.920
Help me...

18:10.718 --> 18:14.422
Eve: Joy. Joy, get up!

18:19.513 --> 18:21.730
What the...?

18:23.738 --> 18:25.371
What happened?

18:25.396 --> 18:26.825
You fell.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.644
You were running.

18:31.328 --> 18:33.253
I was running...?

18:40.404 --> 18:42.864
I was running to catch Dad.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.627
Gimme a break, okay?

18:44.652 --> 18:47.009
I told you it was a bad idea
to race.

18:47.606 --> 18:48.650
We were racing?

18:48.675 --> 18:50.377
Stop messing around, Joy.

18:50.789 --> 18:53.209
Your backpack will be
by the doors.

18:57.853 --> 18:58.794
What?

19:06.565 --> 19:07.226
What?!

19:08.166 --> 19:10.469
Are these mine?

19:12.613 --> 19:15.879
Wait! No, no, no, no.
Where are you going?!

19:16.816 --> 19:19.018
What happened to me?!

19:24.185 --> 19:25.408
Oh gosh...

19:28.392 --> 19:29.261
Woo!

19:31.014 --> 19:32.797
Oh, dear God.

19:32.923 --> 19:36.539
Oh, Montana! Hey!

19:38.390 --> 19:39.313
Uh...

19:39.472 --> 19:42.079
My bag, my bag... um...

19:44.919 --> 19:45.771
Okay.

19:46.606 --> 19:48.743
Tom: Where do you think
you're going?

19:48.768 --> 19:50.113
Oh!

19:52.117 --> 19:53.121
Tom Addison?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.205
Are you... are you mad at me?

19:55.149 --> 19:55.963
What?

19:56.163 --> 19:58.460
Yeah, you're being all weird.

19:59.263 --> 20:02.428
I... I am?

20:02.707 --> 20:04.456
All right, fine. Be mad at me.

20:04.481 --> 20:06.351
But it's not my fault
you've got such a hot body.

20:07.018 --> 20:08.382
Me?

20:09.593 --> 20:11.977
Joy, did you take those
megavitamins again?

20:12.002 --> 20:16.088
I don't know.
I must have taken something.

20:16.539 --> 20:18.377
Okay, I get it.

20:18.636 --> 20:20.379
You're upset about
the ring thing.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.614
The ring thing?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.526
Yeah. It's just a legit way
of letting everyone know

20:25.551 --> 20:27.397
that we're a total couple.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.339
Let's go.

20:29.971 --> 20:32.073
Couple?!

20:48.321 --> 20:49.793
Yeah.

20:52.396 --> 20:53.739
Hmm.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.754
I don't want to go to class.

20:59.779 --> 21:00.653
No?

21:00.875 --> 21:02.262
- I only wanna be with you.
- Oh.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.233
Oh...

21:10.876 --> 21:13.757
- Thank you.
- See 'ya after second period, baby.

21:21.431 --> 21:24.916
Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my God.

21:24.941 --> 21:27.418
Ow! Get it together.

21:27.443 --> 21:28.470
Oh my God.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.874
Chanel: I love this.
- Yeah.

21:32.268 --> 21:34.330
- Hey, sweetie!
- Hot top!

21:34.355 --> 21:35.814
- Cute pants.
- You rock.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.379
So what're we doing
this weekend?

21:37.404 --> 21:38.590
Yeah, maybe if you're not
working out

21:38.615 --> 21:40.543
we can go to the Westside Mall.

21:40.838 --> 21:42.106
Northside Mall?
What?

21:42.131 --> 21:44.176
- Southside Mall?
- Eastside Plaza?

21:44.201 --> 21:45.426
There's a difference?

21:45.567 --> 21:47.067
Well, you don't have
to tell us now -

21:47.092 --> 21:49.322
just think about it, 'Kay?
We'd love to hang with you.

21:49.347 --> 21:51.429
Yeah, we can just like
think about it or whatever.

21:51.454 --> 21:52.757
All right, well,
see you later!

21:52.782 --> 21:54.658
Both: Kisses! Muah!

21:56.898 --> 21:58.815
What is happening?
What is happening?

22:02.576 --> 22:04.583
That was so weird.

22:27.464 --> 22:29.296
No... What?

22:30.823 --> 22:33.849
Varsity volleyball?

22:35.878 --> 22:37.833
Okay.

22:41.411 --> 22:43.771
Sorry I'm late.

22:46.226 --> 22:48.028
Um...

22:52.013 --> 22:54.200
Uh... 'Kay.

22:54.987 --> 22:59.140
Mr. Elderberry, I think that I
left my instrument in the car.

22:59.165 --> 23:00.395
Excuse me?

23:00.565 --> 23:02.562
Sorry, my clarinet.

23:02.767 --> 23:04.437
You are so bold.

23:05.436 --> 23:07.511
I play the clarinet.
First chair.

23:07.663 --> 23:09.595
No, you don't.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.720
Come on, you're joking, right?

23:12.745 --> 23:14.728
No, I'm not.

23:14.753 --> 23:16.942
You've never taken
a music class.

23:17.416 --> 23:18.189
But...

23:22.261 --> 23:24.048
This is orchestra.

23:25.389 --> 23:27.876
My name's Joy, right?

23:28.189 --> 23:30.636
You'd better figure out
where you belong, young lady.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.025
We have a lot of work to do.

23:35.226 --> 23:36.827
Nurse: You're temperature
is normal.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.337
I feel normal?

23:39.226 --> 23:41.812
I... I don't feel normal.

23:42.061 --> 23:44.735
And I don't look normal,
that's for sure.

23:45.135 --> 23:47.118
I think I should call
your mother.

23:47.668 --> 23:48.889
Good luck with that.

23:52.878 --> 23:54.509
What number should I try,
sweetheart?

23:54.628 --> 23:59.354
Um... 555-0100.

23:59.546 --> 24:00.655
Uh...

24:01.237 --> 24:04.746
I've got three numbers,
but that's not one of them.

24:06.776 --> 24:08.939
Oh... Could I see that?

24:09.633 --> 24:10.501
Yeah.

24:14.241 --> 24:14.941
Thanks.

24:19.627 --> 24:21.343
Joy...

24:23.459 --> 24:24.853
Wellman?

24:25.950 --> 24:27.926
Joy Wellman.

24:29.098 --> 24:31.129
Joy Wellman!

24:31.762 --> 24:33.837
I'm Joy Wellman!

24:34.657 --> 24:37.039
Okay, honey. Easy does it.

24:39.715 --> 24:41.102
How's your head feel?

24:41.764 --> 24:44.644
Honestly? I think
I'm hallucinating.

24:44.669 --> 24:46.625
Okay. Maybe it's the flu.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.996
Or maybe you ran too hard.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.208
Yes! I was running.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.422
I was running and that was
when everything got weird.

24:53.447 --> 24:55.339
I told your Dad, I told him

24:55.364 --> 24:57.084
that your new weight training
was too hard.

24:57.242 --> 24:58.490
Weight training...

24:59.652 --> 25:01.459
Can I ask you a question.
Yes.

25:01.786 --> 25:04.688
- Where are you taking me?
- Home.

25:05.031 --> 25:07.429
To my house on Elm Street?

25:07.865 --> 25:09.981
Yeah, the one you've lived in
your whole life.

25:10.562 --> 25:12.637
242 Elm Street?

25:13.724 --> 25:16.153
244 Elm Street.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.467
Oh geez, come on.

25:19.688 --> 25:20.840
Come on.

25:22.218 --> 25:25.122
This sure is a nice car.

25:25.147 --> 25:26.424
Hey, don't start.

25:26.449 --> 25:28.013
You know Daddy said
when you turn sixteen

25:28.038 --> 25:29.774
you'll get you exactly
what Eve has.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.623
Really?

25:32.925 --> 25:35.633
As long as you continue to
make all-City first team.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.734
Yeah.

25:38.910 --> 25:41.873
You know, thanks for coming
to get me.

25:42.065 --> 25:44.579
You are my bright
shining star.

25:45.751 --> 25:47.729
The brightest one in the sky?

25:48.092 --> 25:51.523
Well, your big sister is also
my bright shining star.

25:51.548 --> 25:52.982
You know, some days.

25:54.230 --> 25:56.654
A sister is so cool.

25:56.679 --> 25:58.700
You know, I've always wanted
a sister.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.264
That's the attitude.

26:01.062 --> 26:04.934
And, um,
Tom Addison,

26:04.969 --> 26:09.287
he is my boyfriend, right?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.850
Joy, are you pregnant?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.346
Uh, wha-? No! No!

26:16.371 --> 26:17.764
Because if that's what this
is about-

26:17.789 --> 26:19.932
- No! No, no, no, no, no.
No, I've...

26:19.957 --> 26:22.353
I swear, I've...
I've only ever kissed him!

26:22.378 --> 26:24.287
Okay.
Don't scare me like that, Joy.

26:24.312 --> 26:27.093
- Yeah.
- Woo!

26:27.223 --> 26:29.037
So he's definitely
my boyfriend.

26:29.150 --> 26:30.716
You know, I don't approve
of the two of you

26:30.741 --> 26:31.576
going up to his cabin.

26:31.601 --> 26:33.507
I think I've been very clear
about that.

26:33.727 --> 26:37.748
Wait. His cabin?
Just the two of us?

26:37.773 --> 26:39.995
You said that his cousin
was coming.

26:40.652 --> 26:42.553
- He is.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.030
Aren't green and red
so over used?

27:46.625 --> 27:49.090
- Whoa!
- You okay?

27:49.669 --> 27:50.856
Yeah... it's just...

27:51.493 --> 27:53.596
it looks so nice in here.

27:54.336 --> 27:57.637
Does in it say Holiday
in a whole new way?

27:57.942 --> 28:00.244
Whoa! My name's on a stocking!

28:00.590 --> 28:01.986
Of course it is.

28:02.203 --> 28:04.467
There's nothing different.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.553
Unless you're noticing I put
new garlands up.

28:09.510 --> 28:12.949
Yeah. That must be it.

28:14.521 --> 28:16.659
Isn't turquoise a cheery
color?

28:17.510 --> 28:19.146
Do you want something to eat?

28:20.213 --> 28:22.749
Oh! I can't remember the last
time I was in a kitchen

28:22.774 --> 28:24.402
and someone made me that offer.

28:24.464 --> 28:25.601
Don't be sarcastic.

28:25.626 --> 28:27.593
As long as you stick
to your training foods.

28:27.690 --> 28:29.389
- Right.
- How about something to drink?

28:29.845 --> 28:31.850
Uh, do you have orange juice?

28:32.224 --> 28:33.235
Yeah. Coming right up.

28:33.272 --> 28:34.883
Or... what about cranberry?

28:35.637 --> 28:36.256
Okay.

28:36.521 --> 28:39.368
Or um... guava?

28:39.647 --> 28:41.321
It's fresh.

28:45.968 --> 28:48.388
It's like a portal
to a magic kingdom!

28:51.889 --> 28:53.048
Okay...

28:53.473 --> 28:54.289
So um...

28:54.909 --> 28:56.086
you're always here
to take care of me

28:56.111 --> 28:57.195
when I come home, aren't you?

28:57.596 --> 28:58.365
Of course.

28:58.545 --> 29:00.982
And you always make me
good things to eat, don't you?

29:01.573 --> 29:04.901
I do. Your Dad and I are very
concerned about your health.

29:05.157 --> 29:06.932
Wow... Wait.

29:07.318 --> 29:10.071
Do you also make the beds
and do the laundry and stuff?

29:10.719 --> 29:12.948
Okay, what is this about?

29:13.869 --> 29:17.610
Uh... to... thank you.
That's all.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.576
You know, I probably
don't say it enough.

29:19.883 --> 29:20.909
Who does?

29:21.537 --> 29:24.046
Okay. Well, you should go up
to your room

29:24.071 --> 29:25.564
and try to lie down.

29:25.610 --> 29:27.463
Yeah. Okay.

29:32.638 --> 29:33.284
Mom?

29:34.388 --> 29:35.380
Yes, honey?

29:42.052 --> 29:44.875
I'll uh... I'll be in my room.

29:45.394 --> 29:46.964
Try to take a nap.

29:47.587 --> 29:48.293
Yeah.

30:01.122 --> 30:03.776
Your organizational skills
are so good.

30:04.850 --> 30:06.061
- I know.
- Yeah.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.868
Do want any, um, help
with the chores?

30:08.869 --> 30:11.188
Honey, just get going.

30:11.429 --> 30:13.532

32:19.090 --> 32:21.244
I heard you came home
from school early today.

32:21.269 --> 32:23.109
- Yeah...
- That's not fair.

32:24.194 --> 32:25.271
Oh... I...

32:25.388 --> 32:27.250
We're sisters, okay?

32:27.441 --> 32:29.091
It needs to be equal.

32:29.464 --> 32:31.348
Yes. Sisters.

32:31.382 --> 32:32.997
I've always wanted a sister.

32:33.309 --> 32:35.171
Are you mocking me?

32:35.208 --> 32:37.389
What? No! No, I would never
do that.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.880
No, no! I would
never do that!

32:39.905 --> 32:41.980
I'm sorry. Did I-did I sound
like that?

32:42.005 --> 32:44.055
My voice gets high
when I'm nervous.

32:44.895 --> 32:47.881
I'm making a special wish
this Christmas.

32:49.357 --> 32:51.232
Okay. What-what-what'd you
wish for?

32:52.452 --> 32:55.164
It's not for me.
It's for you.

32:56.524 --> 32:57.418
What is it?

32:58.668 --> 33:00.040
A vacation.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.911
That you never come home from!

33:07.389 --> 33:08.084
Oh.

33:08.915 --> 33:11.901
You know if life was I'd be head
of the Cowboys and have 5 sons.

33:11.925 --> 33:15.868
Ok, well instead you have solid job
in sales and 2 wonderful daughters.

33:15.981 --> 33:17.395
At least one is wonderful.

33:17.419 --> 33:18.852
Don't give up on Eve.

33:18.876 --> 33:21.924
It's just you what said about Joy
makes it sound like she could be on drugs.

33:21.948 --> 33:23.339
Joy wouldn't do that.

33:24.442 --> 33:26.187
Performance enhancers
are one thing you know...

33:26.490 --> 33:26.872
but...

33:27.784 --> 33:29.277
let me get to the bottom of this.

33:31.418 --> 33:33.074
No way. Really?

33:34.537 --> 33:36.329
Oh, uh, I gotta go.

33:36.469 --> 33:38.438
Thanks so much for calling
to check on me, Brie.

33:38.883 --> 33:39.471
Bye!

33:40.713 --> 33:41.537
Hey.

33:41.633 --> 33:43.075
Carbs plus protein.

33:43.431 --> 33:44.620
How's my little spiker?

33:45.938 --> 33:46.573
Great.

33:47.387 --> 33:49.020
All right. You had us worried.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.931
Yeah, I know. I feel okay now.

33:51.376 --> 33:53.977
Actually, I feel more than okay.

33:54.152 --> 33:55.109
I feel great.

33:55.596 --> 33:56.950
That's what I like to hear.

33:58.958 --> 34:01.585
So, uh, are you nervous
about volleyball?

34:02.794 --> 34:04.192
I don't think so.

34:04.368 --> 34:06.182
It's just these
Championship matches

34:06.207 --> 34:07.969
have a way of messing
with your mind.

34:09.137 --> 34:10.440
It's so amazing, you know?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.123
I'm like a part
of the whole thing.

34:12.658 --> 34:13.936
Yeah, well, being a captain

34:13.960 --> 34:15.587
comes with extra
responsibilities.

34:17.830 --> 34:22.206
Let me ask you something, Dad.

34:22.904 --> 34:24.746
Sure. What is it?

34:25.608 --> 34:30.157
Uh, have I always been good
at volleyball?

34:30.764 --> 34:32.534
Joy, what's going on?

34:32.943 --> 34:34.879
It's just so surprising,
you know?

34:35.266 --> 34:36.893
I mean, who knew I was even
coordinated?

34:37.089 --> 34:39.393
Well, we've worked very hard
to get you where we are today.

34:39.574 --> 34:42.387
Oh, I bet. Everybody at
school sure knows who I am.

34:42.554 --> 34:43.446
Well, you're a leader.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.723
I must have gotten like
a hundred texts today.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.232
All right, I want you to get
your sleep tonight, all right?

34:48.257 --> 34:49.255
No screen-time.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.183
We already told Tom
you need your rest.

34:51.429 --> 34:52.994
So I want lights out
after you eat.

34:53.879 --> 34:55.543
Okay. Uh... but...

34:55.659 --> 34:57.402
What... what about my homework?

34:57.981 --> 34:59.526
Homework? Look,

34:59.823 --> 35:02.254
if any teacher gives you grief
tomorrow, I'm gonna step in.

35:03.524 --> 35:04.233
Cool.

35:04.878 --> 35:06.012
Oh, and tomorrow morning,

35:06.161 --> 35:07.401
we're back to our normal
schedule.

35:08.752 --> 35:09.536
Schedule...?

35:10.247 --> 35:10.940
Yeah.

35:22.396 --> 35:23.623
Rod: Woo! Up and at 'em!
Let's go!

35:23.648 --> 35:25.610
- Oh my... wait.. what?
- Come on, we've got five miles to get in

35:25.635 --> 35:26.928

wakes up.

35:26.953 --> 35:28.223

- How was your workout?

38:24.228 --> 38:25.533
When's the next hearing?

38:25.569 --> 38:26.527
Three weeks.

38:26.552 --> 38:28.454
The Judge has ordered voice-box
surgery,

38:28.479 --> 38:31.137
and if they don't comply they
will put the crazy beast down.

38:31.724 --> 38:32.559
- Wait!
- Yes!

38:32.898 --> 38:34.955
Wait. You guys are talking
about the Hockstatter's dog?

38:35.042 --> 38:35.806
Levi?

38:35.979 --> 38:38.245
It's very important we get
rid of that dog.

38:38.833 --> 38:39.773
Why?

38:42.588 --> 38:43.896
Is she okay?

38:43.980 --> 38:45.438
You know that
the Hockstatter's dog

38:45.463 --> 38:47.739
is an anxiety trigger
for your sister.

38:47.764 --> 38:49.397
- You know that.
- Oh.

38:49.921 --> 38:51.680
Yeah, mornings are hard
for your sister.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.290
But we can't sleep in until
noon every day.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.930
- Nope.
- No.

38:55.955 --> 38:58.543
Rehab isn't just about
substance abuse, Joy.

38:59.466 --> 39:01.234
Of-of course. Of course not.

39:02.414 --> 39:04.232
Rehab. Wow...

39:04.257 --> 39:05.838
Don't touch me!

39:07.459 --> 39:10.195
Why don't you... take that
to go and get ready

39:10.220 --> 39:12.399
'cause your sister's gonna
drive you to school!

39:13.429 --> 39:14.239
'Kay.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.347
I'm gonna take
the sharp knife.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.063
Eve, before I go, I just...

39:29.339 --> 39:31.876
I want you to know that
anything that I have is yours.

39:31.993 --> 39:34.002
Okay, I am all about sharing
with you.

39:34.299 --> 39:37.492
Dr. Mike says I need to
create my own destiny.

39:37.605 --> 39:39.410
Oh, that's a good idea.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.858
But I don't know how.

39:42.579 --> 39:45.192
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

39:46.064 --> 39:46.928
Yeah.

39:47.755 --> 39:50.079
- You can get out of my car!
- What?

39:51.319 --> 39:52.127
Oh.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.202
- Go!
- I'm Sorry.

39:57.038 --> 40:01.308
♪ Let's go wherever
the wind blows ♪

40:01.332 --> 40:04.597
♪ Take me now,
roll the windows down ♪

40:04.622 --> 40:08.711
♪ Let's go to a place
only we know ♪

40:08.736 --> 40:13.034
♪ Above the clouds
won't you blow me away ♪

40:13.059 --> 40:15.100
♪ Take me there
wanna go there ♪

40:15.125 --> 40:16.897
Tom: There is my Joy.
Hey, baby.

40:17.893 --> 40:20.551
Hey, Tom Addison.

40:26.459 --> 40:27.746
Feeling any better?

40:28.274 --> 40:29.689
Mm-hmm.

40:30.481 --> 40:34.189
'Cause, uh, I missed you
last night. Big time.

40:34.835 --> 40:36.628
Well, I missed you, too.

40:36.732 --> 40:37.783
All I could think about

40:37.920 --> 40:39.592
was going up to that cabin
with you and...

40:39.617 --> 40:42.045
I was burning up.
I kinda felt crazy inside.

40:42.070 --> 40:44.814
But... uh, d-do you feel
better now?

40:45.717 --> 40:46.889
Only if you do.

40:47.165 --> 40:49.319
Yes. I feel great.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.316
Awesome!

40:53.794 --> 40:55.674
You didn't see any other guys
last night, did you?

40:55.762 --> 40:57.215
What? No.

40:57.286 --> 40:57.997
You swear?

40:57.998 --> 41:00.083
No, I-I swear.
I wa-I was sick.

41:00.108 --> 41:02.653
Besides, why...
why would I do that?

41:02.771 --> 41:05.067
If-f-f-f-f I found out that
you were into someone else,

41:05.092 --> 41:06.090
I mean, I...

41:06.115 --> 41:07.731
Tom, Tom...

41:09.078 --> 41:12.531
You are the only guy
that I care about.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.293
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:14.611 --> 41:15.754
Say it again.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.324
- Lit-literally?
- Go on.

41:20.923 --> 41:22.325
Oh, um...

41:23.778 --> 41:25.544
You're the only guy
that I care about.

41:26.477 --> 41:27.817
Thatta girl.

41:28.540 --> 41:30.432
Can you say it louder?

41:30.645 --> 41:32.642
You know, why don't I just write
it on a piece of paper for you?

41:32.667 --> 41:34.237
- Yeah?
- That way you can look at it all the time.

41:34.262 --> 41:35.151
- Mmm...
- Okay.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.526
Okay.

41:40.868 --> 41:43.158
Um... Okay.

41:43.449 --> 41:44.658
- Uh...
- Here.

41:45.179 --> 41:46.229
Okay.

41:46.577 --> 41:47.932
Okay.

41:52.683 --> 41:55.665
You know, uh, we should...
we should probably get going.

41:55.690 --> 41:58.243
Yeah, I'll uh...
see you after class.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.063
Okay.

41:59.867 --> 42:01.493
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

42:01.585 --> 42:02.344
What?

42:02.845 --> 42:05.368
Uh, you work out with the
volleyball team first period.

42:06.755 --> 42:08.212
Right! Yeah!

42:09.698 --> 42:11.788
That should be interesting.

42:13.606 --> 42:14.718
Think of me.

42:17.933 --> 42:18.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:28.696 --> 42:30.986
Were you up late jumping
cyber walls?

42:31.959 --> 42:33.033
Excuse me?

42:34.222 --> 42:36.455
It's okay.
It's our secret.

42:37.274 --> 42:38.705
What's our secret?

42:41.640 --> 42:44.744
Sam, it's me, Joy.

42:45.114 --> 42:48.096
We were Bowling Pins
for Halloween, remember?

42:49.419 --> 42:51.742
We-we both got Chicken Pox
from Ronnie Oldhauser

42:51.767 --> 42:53.650
when we were in third grade.

42:54.471 --> 42:55.830
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:56.653 --> 42:57.791
Come-come on, we-we...

42:57.816 --> 42:59.096
we did a community service
project

42:59.121 --> 43:01.189
at the animal shelter
like two summers ago.

43:02.370 --> 43:05.353
We spent a month not eating
anything orange in fifth grade.

43:06.985 --> 43:10.127
We took ceramics, we...
we're both afraid of spiders...

43:10.152 --> 43:12.236
Uh, I'm-I'm not afraid
of spiders.

43:12.307 --> 43:13.329
Yes, you...

43:13.801 --> 43:16.150
Okay, fine. Just between us.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.676
Look, we... we have
our favorite shows, right?

43:22.066 --> 43:24.521
And we read a lot
of the same books and...

43:26.584 --> 43:28.123
and-and you...

43:28.449 --> 43:30.107
you were there for me...

43:31.035 --> 43:33.208
You were there for me
when my mom got sick.

43:35.161 --> 43:36.833
You remember that, right?

43:39.634 --> 43:41.185
Look, we've been going
to school together

43:41.210 --> 43:42.865
since we were five.
Right.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.615
You've never said
more than one word to me.

43:46.732 --> 43:47.974
We should keep it that way.

44:05.761 --> 44:06.641
Okay.

44:07.212 --> 44:08.849
- Mine.
- Here. Yeah.

44:09.339 --> 44:10.755
- Joy!
- Joy!

44:14.805 --> 44:16.489
Coach Weber: Girls, hustle in!

44:18.423 --> 44:20.077
Okay!

44:21.909 --> 44:23.184
Joy, are you okay today?

44:25.937 --> 44:26.701
Yeah.

44:26.922 --> 44:28.706
Okay. 'Cause if you're coming
down with something.

44:28.811 --> 44:30.854
You gotta tell me, right?
We gotta nip it in the bud.

44:31.295 --> 44:32.352
No, I'm good.

44:32.513 --> 44:33.759
Okay, superstar!

44:36.552 --> 44:39.272
All right! In two days
we are facing Churchill

44:39.297 --> 44:40.746
for the state championship.

44:40.866 --> 44:42.804
And it's been a tough year,
I get it -

44:42.852 --> 44:45.807
we have faced some intense
competition.

44:46.432 --> 44:47.529
Now think to yourself,

44:47.554 --> 44:50.868
why have we been able to win,
huh?

44:50.912 --> 44:52.370
- I don't know.
- Because we have Joy.

44:52.395 --> 44:53.715
- Yeah.
- Of course.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.173
Okay. All right.

44:55.206 --> 44:56.763
Yeah, not the answer
I was thinking of,

44:56.788 --> 44:59.054
but yes, yes!

44:59.121 --> 45:02.969
She is a huge part of our - my!
Our success.

45:02.994 --> 45:04.783
- I am?
- Absolutely.

45:04.898 --> 45:06.276
Here we go.
Don't leave me hanging.

45:06.417 --> 45:07.636
- Oh.
- Give me one of these.

45:07.661 --> 45:08.741
Again!

45:09.501 --> 45:12.786
But I, I was gonna say
teamwork. Right?

45:13.016 --> 45:14.870
Coming together as a unit.

45:15.634 --> 45:16.606
Like that.

45:17.044 --> 45:18.472
Let's get some nods
on that one.

45:18.865 --> 45:19.601
Yeah.

45:20.105 --> 45:22.014
All right, let's uh, do
a scrimmage to warm up.

45:22.039 --> 45:22.977
Bring it in, ladies!

45:23.002 --> 45:24.219
Oh, yes!

45:25.188 --> 45:27.435
All: One, two, three, break!
Joy: Break!

45:28.938 --> 45:30.061
Thatta girl.

45:30.354 --> 45:31.128
Break.

45:32.985 --> 45:33.747
Okay.

45:36.301 --> 45:40.104
Joy - pcckkk!
You got it.

45:40.571 --> 45:41.762
- ' Kay.
- Yep.

45:43.850 --> 45:44.809
Coach Weber: Adorable.

45:44.834 --> 45:46.076
Alright, look alive out there,
ladies!

45:46.101 --> 45:46.814
Okay.

45:47.327 --> 45:48.680
Oh God.
Coach Weber: Call it!

45:49.035 --> 45:50.382
Keep it up!
What?

45:50.590 --> 45:51.623
Call it!

45:54.601 --> 45:56.124
- Oh!
- Oh!

46:04.333 --> 46:06.432
Yes!

46:12.091 --> 46:13.967
You guys were so good
out there!

46:13.992 --> 46:15.155
You were amazing!

46:29.879 --> 46:31.683
You know what? I uh...
I'll catch you guys later.

46:31.673 --> 46:32.985
I gotta get a book
from the library.

46:33.454 --> 46:34.252
Girl 1: Yeah, right.

46:34.347 --> 46:36.275
Are you meeting Tom
in the reserve section?

46:36.300 --> 46:38.037
Mm-hmm. Very funny!

46:38.540 --> 46:39.790
Bye!

46:53.834 --> 46:57.282
Hey! I love your shoes.

46:58.457 --> 47:00.536
No, no. I... I mean it.

47:02.803 --> 47:05.220
You know, I... I don't take
orchestra anymore.

47:05.370 --> 47:07.576
But I guess you don't either.

47:09.191 --> 47:11.273
You never really did like
the oboe, huh?

47:14.558 --> 47:17.447
Hey, uh... wanna know a secret?

47:17.760 --> 47:22.213
Tom Addison, he does smell
like hot apple cider.

47:22.852 --> 47:24.218
What do you want from me?

47:26.099 --> 47:28.615
- We used to be friends.
- On another planet?

47:28.574 --> 47:30.511
Yeah, actually, kind of.

47:31.819 --> 47:34.148
I haven't played the oboe
since fourth grade.

47:35.870 --> 47:37.378
Why are you talking to me?

47:39.465 --> 47:41.961
I just thought that maybe you
and I could hang out sometime.

47:41.986 --> 47:44.009
You know, I feel like
we would be good together.

47:44.034 --> 47:45.937
Really! And we could even go
to the pep rally...

47:46.202 --> 47:48.098
if you wanted. Please?

47:48.910 --> 47:50.589
I could report you
for bullying.

47:53.309 --> 47:54.027
Hmm.

47:55.499 --> 47:56.400
That's nice.

47:59.478 --> 48:01.344
Okay. Okay.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.339
Okay, who's got some school
spirit here?

48:11.583 --> 48:13.106
I can't hear you!

48:13.536 --> 48:14.548
Woot! Woot!

48:14.607 --> 48:16.171
Yeah, that's more like it!

48:16.196 --> 48:18.386
That's more like it.
Good stuff.

48:18.989 --> 48:21.424
Guys, tomorrow,
the girls' volleyball team

48:21.449 --> 48:24.244
will be playing Churchill
for the state championship,

48:24.380 --> 48:27.665
and we are gonna run
right over them!

48:27.690 --> 48:29.105
Am I right?

48:29.407 --> 48:30.954
Yeah, I'm right!

48:32.188 --> 48:33.684
Woo!

48:33.959 --> 48:35.546
All right, all right, I uh...

48:35.571 --> 48:37.757
I wanna bring someone up,
one of the athletes,

48:37.782 --> 48:38.896
to say a few words.

48:38.921 --> 48:41.113
And this player is the...

48:41.245 --> 48:45.149
Oh boy, she is the backbone
of our team,

48:45.174 --> 48:49.976
and you know every single game
she helps us in a critical way,

48:50.153 --> 48:53.308
helps the entire team -
not just me, but me for sure.

48:53.731 --> 48:55.843
I know you know
who I'm talking about -

48:56.010 --> 48:58.051
I shouldn't cry through this.

48:58.643 --> 49:01.253
I mean, I love her,
but I know you love her too.

49:01.325 --> 49:02.904
She's just a sophomore
right now,

49:02.929 --> 49:06.861
but she is easily the star
of the whole league.

49:07.123 --> 49:08.300
You know who I'm talking about!

49:08.325 --> 49:11.972
Let's hear for Joy Wellman!

49:11.997 --> 49:13.673
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

49:18.682 --> 49:20.051
Yeah.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.091
- Get up here.
- Go get' em, Joy!

49:22.126 --> 49:23.133
Come on, Joy!

49:23.158 --> 49:25.121
No one's gonna believe
that you're shy, Joy.

49:26.567 --> 49:29.036
- Come on, you little cutie.
- Woo!

49:32.437 --> 49:33.905
All right! Let's do this.

49:33.930 --> 49:35.980
Oh my God, I don't wanna let
go, ever!

49:36.482 --> 49:38.298
You smell great.
Your hair is soft.

49:38.711 --> 49:40.346
She can do anything!

49:40.890 --> 49:44.866
Hi... wow. Tom...

49:44.891 --> 49:47.010
- Yup.
- Um...

49:55.391 --> 49:56.321
Yup.

50:00.726 --> 50:01.718
Yeah.

50:05.551 --> 50:06.976
So far so good.

50:07.498 --> 50:09.181
- Sorry.
- You know what? Just um...

50:09.206 --> 50:10.961
Just tell everybody
your thoughts.

50:11.151 --> 50:13.296
- Ahem.
- Yep.

50:18.679 --> 50:19.598
My God.

50:24.230 --> 50:27.150
Sam Walker...

50:27.756 --> 50:30.822
is going out with
Mimi Taggelmeier?

50:32.187 --> 50:33.373
What's up with that?

50:41.890 --> 50:42.990
I'm sorry.

50:49.812 --> 50:50.838
Coach Weber: No, you were great.

50:50.863 --> 50:52.279
It's okay, but I...

50:52.616 --> 50:54.813
You know, I just don't think I've ever
been good at talking in front of groups.

50:54.838 --> 50:57.018
Okay, it wasn't you.
It was that audience.

50:57.043 --> 50:58.650
- It was me.
- They were stinky. Yeah, yeah.

50:58.675 --> 51:00.761
Besides, pressure does
a funny thing to your mind.

51:00.786 --> 51:02.709
You just have to shake it off.

51:03.256 --> 51:04.093
Thank you, Coach Weber.

51:04.118 --> 51:06.367
No, hey, call me Coach.

51:09.682 --> 51:10.443
Hey.

51:10.756 --> 51:12.093
How was school?

51:12.357 --> 51:13.794
Okay.

51:15.190 --> 51:17.565
Hey, um, how come Eve
doesn't take me home?

51:17.879 --> 51:20.087
You girls have your own
schedules. You know that.

51:20.112 --> 51:22.856
- Right.
- This afternoon she starts her kick-boxing lessons.

51:22.881 --> 51:25.010
Oh. Kick-boxing...

51:25.035 --> 51:28.264
Did you want her to come
with you today to Dr. Mike?

51:28.566 --> 51:29.705
Oh no, no.

51:31.038 --> 51:33.768
Unless she wants to go
with me to Dr. Mike.

51:35.995 --> 51:37.961
Remind me again who Dr. Mike is.

51:38.348 --> 51:40.938
He's your Sports Enhancement
specialist.

51:40.983 --> 51:41.754
Right.

51:41.934 --> 51:43.872
And your life coach.

51:45.017 --> 51:47.240
So I guess that sports
are my life.

51:49.829 --> 51:50.660
Yeah.

51:51.970 --> 51:53.230
You could say that.

51:54.846 --> 51:56.329
Dr. Mike: So how was
the weekend?

51:57.197 --> 51:58.785
Pretty mixed up.

51:59.628 --> 52:02.067
Is that because of issues
with your family?

52:03.716 --> 52:06.172
Look, you can share
with Dr. Mike.

52:07.041 --> 52:09.350
Dr. Mike will think I'm wacko.

52:09.797 --> 52:11.988
Do you feel like a wacko?

52:12.013 --> 52:14.280
Feels like a wacko.

52:14.305 --> 52:16.641
I guess you always
take notes, don't you?

52:17.549 --> 52:21.329
Oh. I'm sensing
a little bit of hostility.

52:21.354 --> 52:22.058
Okay.

52:23.912 --> 52:26.077
How are your feelings about Tom?

52:26.731 --> 52:30.174
Tom... Yeah, I just...

52:30.330 --> 52:32.511
I can't believe
how much he likes me.

52:32.536 --> 52:35.053
- Yeah.
- You know? It's crazy.

52:35.103 --> 52:37.075
Is he still pressuring you
to have sex?

52:37.563 --> 52:38.534
Excuse me?

52:38.584 --> 52:40.916
Yeah, you don't have to go
the cabin if you don't want to.

52:42.077 --> 52:43.508
Uh...

52:43.848 --> 52:49.341
I don't really wanna talk
about that right now.

52:49.428 --> 52:50.808
- Okay.
- No.

52:50.942 --> 52:51.824
Okay.

52:52.764 --> 52:56.172
Okay, so how are your feelings
about your older sibling?

52:57.596 --> 52:58.351
Eve.

52:58.376 --> 53:00.331
Uh, do you have another
older sibling?

53:01.005 --> 53:03.293
Yes. What is the story
with my sister?

53:03.518 --> 53:05.452
What is this,
test Dr. Mike day?

53:05.937 --> 53:07.084
I...

53:08.090 --> 53:11.034
I just always thought
that she was so happy.

53:12.727 --> 53:15.895
See, Eve feels like she lives
in your shadow

53:16.735 --> 53:20.513
and your achievements make her
feel inferior.

53:21.982 --> 53:25.687
Certain personality traits
are better suited

53:25.712 --> 53:27.396
to an only children.

53:29.027 --> 53:30.142
That sucks.

53:30.167 --> 53:31.271
It does suck.

53:32.093 --> 53:35.568
And you have to remember
to give Eve her own light.

53:36.916 --> 53:37.981
Yeah.

53:38.752 --> 53:39.804
I'll try.

53:39.970 --> 53:41.575
Excellent. A breakthrough!

53:41.693 --> 53:42.706
No kidding.

53:42.731 --> 53:44.881
Okay, I'd like to try
a little word association

53:44.906 --> 53:46.686
seeing how you're
so receptive today.

53:46.711 --> 53:47.445
Yeah.

53:47.470 --> 53:50.153
Now, no thinking -
just off the top of your head.

53:50.342 --> 53:51.056
Ready?

53:51.081 --> 53:52.181
- 'Kay.
- Here we go.

53:52.765 --> 53:53.833
Bam!

53:54.729 --> 53:56.004
Sam.

53:56.790 --> 53:58.026
Sam?

53:59.095 --> 54:00.509
Yeah, he uh...

54:00.846 --> 54:02.636
he goes to my school.

54:03.877 --> 54:05.327
He's my bestie.

54:06.335 --> 54:07.757
Bestie? I'm...

54:08.484 --> 54:09.734
Uh, bestie.

54:09.737 --> 54:10.929
My best friend.

54:11.225 --> 54:13.082
Oh. Okay.

54:14.101 --> 54:16.268
Or at least he used to be.

54:17.651 --> 54:21.202
Okay. Okay. Let's try
one more, all right?

54:21.402 --> 54:22.663
- All right.
- No thinking.

54:22.834 --> 54:23.945
You ready?

54:24.400 --> 54:25.273
Whew!

54:30.629 --> 54:31.809
Loss.

54:33.132 --> 54:34.200
Really?

54:37.968 --> 54:39.356
How was Dr. Mike?

54:39.450 --> 54:40.580
Good.

54:40.796 --> 54:42.716
He'd like you to make
an appointment to see him.

54:43.610 --> 54:44.443
Me?

54:49.226 --> 54:51.466
You should do weights first
and then your cardio.

54:51.490 --> 54:54.348
Oh, but... shouldn't I do
my homework first?

54:54.911 --> 54:57.621
Workout first.
Homework if there's time.

54:57.646 --> 54:59.010
You know the rules.

55:05.050 --> 55:07.282
Obviously, yeah.

55:07.896 --> 55:09.669
Give it a hundred and ten!

55:30.842 --> 55:32.046
Whoa.

55:35.366 --> 55:36.499
Hm.

55:46.317 --> 55:47.212
Miles?

55:49.027 --> 55:50.163
What the...?

55:55.130 --> 55:57.001
Oh, I don't think so!

56:01.540 --> 56:02.344
Hey!

56:04.543 --> 56:07.265
These are Nana's Christmas
ornaments! Wha...?

56:07.376 --> 56:09.496
How do you know
about our Nana?

56:11.015 --> 56:12.673
Have you been spying on us?

56:12.801 --> 56:13.507
What?

56:15.267 --> 56:18.186
Put. That. Down!

56:21.443 --> 56:23.142
What're you doing?!

56:30.412 --> 56:32.379
What do you have to say
for yourself?

56:33.013 --> 56:35.364
You're gonna get in big
trouble for doing this.

56:36.245 --> 56:37.517
What?

56:37.607 --> 56:39.479
I'm gonna tell my Dad
what you did.

56:39.632 --> 56:40.807
Oh, you're gonna tell him
what I did?

56:40.832 --> 56:43.125
- Yeah!
- What about what you did, huh?!

56:43.245 --> 56:45.243
You know you're not allowed
to play with matches ever!

56:45.268 --> 56:47.430
I have told you that, but...
Don't you walk away!

56:49.129 --> 56:50.260
Bite me!

56:59.245 --> 57:00.478
What're you doing?

57:00.691 --> 57:03.117
Uh, the little boy next door
hit a ball over the fence.

57:03.870 --> 57:06.763
- And you returned it?
- Yeah.

57:06.913 --> 57:10.183
Joy! You know we're in
a lawsuit with those people!

57:10.260 --> 57:12.526
I'm sorry, I...
I wasn't thinking.

57:13.265 --> 57:14.714
You better high tail it
up to the gym!

57:14.704 --> 57:16.202
Your father just got home.

57:16.227 --> 57:17.257
Okay, sorry.

57:20.523 --> 57:22.321
Weights... Weights...
Weights... Weights... Weights...

57:22.346 --> 57:23.441
Okay.

57:25.374 --> 57:27.955
Hmm. 101... 102...

57:29.105 --> 57:30.403
Oh, hey!

57:30.467 --> 57:31.557
Just doing my weights.

57:31.582 --> 57:32.868
Ah. Where' Eve?

57:33.082 --> 57:35.550
Uh, today is her first day
at kick-boxing.

57:35.575 --> 57:37.495
Oh! Hope that's better than
all those hours she spent

57:37.520 --> 57:39.187
learning how to throw an ax.
Ugh.

57:53.476 --> 57:54.901
Don't look.

57:54.963 --> 57:56.465
I need to look.

58:07.434 --> 58:09.359
Poor Dad.

58:11.704 --> 58:13.188
Dad...

58:20.194 --> 58:22.164
What is happening

58:28.941 --> 58:30.452
Tom: ...stop
thinking about the soccer game

58:30.477 --> 58:31.910
the other day.
Uhhuh.

58:31.935 --> 58:33.525
How did I lose the sidelines...
Uhhuh.

58:33.550 --> 58:35.400
...advantage point... Must be
really and looking and noticing...

58:35.425 --> 58:37.336
Wow. That's... that is crazy.

58:37.557 --> 58:38.716
- Joy?
- Ha?

58:38.876 --> 58:39.831
Are you okay?

58:39.987 --> 58:43.607
Oh, uh, Tom, my Dad wants
to talk to me. One second.

58:45.574 --> 58:48.338
- Take your vitamin pack?
- Yeah. And I iced my knee

58:48.363 --> 58:49.710
and I finished my protein shake.

58:49.863 --> 58:51.497
All right, good girl.

58:52.588 --> 58:54.075
Do we run tomorrow?

58:54.240 --> 58:56.471
- What do you think?
- Whatever you say.

58:56.822 --> 58:58.059
All right, that's the
attitude!

58:58.084 --> 58:59.587
But, uh, it's game day.

58:59.728 --> 59:01.296
So let's put it all
into the match, all right?

59:01.829 --> 59:02.824
Right.

59:02.849 --> 59:04.767
All right. Sleep well, spiker.

59:06.466 --> 59:09.323
Hey! Lights out.

59:10.544 --> 59:14.175
Mom, have I ever played
a musical instrument?

59:14.910 --> 59:16.840
You were very musical
when you were little,

59:16.889 --> 59:19.571
always running around singing,
making up instruments.

59:19.596 --> 59:21.151
You were like
the Jonas Brothers.

59:21.176 --> 59:24.684
I mean, but not a brother
and, and, and not a boy,

59:24.709 --> 59:26.646
but you were very musical.

59:27.571 --> 59:28.295
Okay!

59:28.568 --> 59:30.934
So then have you ever thought
about having me take a lesson?

59:31.065 --> 59:32.714
Joy, with your schedule?

59:32.739 --> 59:34.398
No, I know, I just thought
that if...

59:34.423 --> 59:36.316
Listen, your Dad always says:

59:36.341 --> 59:38.426
No one ever gets
a Gatorade endorsement

59:38.451 --> 59:39.736
playing the violin.

59:40.923 --> 59:41.872
Right.

59:42.163 --> 59:43.356
Hang up the phone.

59:43.418 --> 59:44.537
I'm trying.

59:45.016 --> 59:45.917
Okay.

59:50.139 --> 59:52.814
Hey, Tom, it's uh...
it's been an hour, okay?

59:52.839 --> 59:54.764
My parents want me
to go to sleep.

59:55.545 --> 59:56.667
No, I know, but guess what?

59:56.692 --> 59:58.265
You're going to see me tomorrow.

59:58.649 --> 01:00:01.416
Yes.
Yes, you are the best.

01:00:01.584 --> 01:00:03.056
You are the one.

01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:04.688
You're the dream.

01:00:04.886 --> 01:00:06.685
Yeah, okay. I miss you.

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:08.074
I'm hanging up now.

01:00:08.307 --> 01:00:10.322
I'm... I'm gonna hang up.
I'm hanging up.

01:00:10.743 --> 01:00:13.082
I miss you too.
I miss you more.

01:00:13.327 --> 01:00:15.018
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:00:53.154 --> 01:00:55.053
Officer: All right.
We'll check it out.

01:01:00.071 --> 01:01:01.719
What the-?

01:01:09.175 --> 01:01:10.244
Levi, zip it!

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.570
Hi. Excuse me, what's going on?

01:01:12.595 --> 01:01:13.751
Officer: Nothing to worry about.

01:01:13.776 --> 01:01:16.867
Uh, look, I have known
the Hockstatters my whole life.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.428
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

01:01:20.015 --> 01:01:21.442
If everything was fine
you wouldn't be here

01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:23.082
first thing in the morning!

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.171
Don't you play volleyball
for Roosevelt?

01:01:28.304 --> 01:01:30.250
- Yeah.
- And you run track.

01:01:30.275 --> 01:01:31.034
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:34.223
You're the girl with the
incredible time for the mile.

01:01:35.341 --> 01:01:36.728
I guess so.

01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:40.452
So, hey, why don't you tell me
what's going on there?

01:01:40.477 --> 01:01:43.950
Well, the teenage kid
took off last night.

01:01:44.662 --> 01:01:45.712
Zack.

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:48.320
Wait, are-are you sure?

01:01:48.345 --> 01:01:49.318
Yeah, he left a note.

01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:51.847
But don't worry, most kids
make their own way back,

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.808
and we're on it.

01:02:00.042 --> 01:02:01.340
Joy!

01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:04.620
Ugh.

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:10.949
Sorry.

01:02:13.102 --> 01:02:15.802
Wha... What was that about?

01:02:16.448 --> 01:02:18.397
Zack Hockstatter ran away
from home!

01:02:18.588 --> 01:02:21.949
Oh. So you risked getting
a cold, or some awful virus

01:02:21.974 --> 01:02:23.321
running around in your
underwear?

01:02:23.346 --> 01:02:24.837
No, I just,
I saw the police car

01:02:24.862 --> 01:02:26.732
so I figured I would go see
what was going on.

01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:29.336
Well, it doesn't surprise me
that kid ran off.

01:02:29.565 --> 01:02:33.290
That boy has a hateful look
on his face day and night.

01:02:33.338 --> 01:02:35.590
Don't say that, okay?
He does not.

01:02:35.999 --> 01:02:38.046
He is funny and-and he is smart

01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:41.076
and...
and he's nice sometimes.

01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:44.252
It hasn't been that easy
for him since his Mom died.

01:02:44.626 --> 01:02:46.483
Joy, where is this
coming from?

01:02:47.945 --> 01:02:49.052
I just don't think it's right

01:02:49.077 --> 01:02:50.571
to say mean things about people.

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.926
What's wrong, Marcie?

01:02:56.883 --> 01:02:59.965
Eve has run away,
and she left a note.

01:03:00.908 --> 01:03:01.894
What?

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:06.345
Right. Right... thanks.

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:11.158
Dr. Mike feels this is about
Joy's big volleyball game.

01:03:11.432 --> 01:03:13.126
He thinks this the similar
situation of what happens

01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:14.978
before the softball championships.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.036
Right.

01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:17.833
Eve ran away when I played softball.

01:03:18.005 --> 01:03:20.005
She burnt down the garage.

01:03:20.959 --> 01:03:22.465
God! How can I forget that!

01:03:22.911 --> 01:03:24.911
What does Dr. Mike think we should do?

01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:26.536
He doesn't want us to call the police.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.754
- Why not?
- Well come on! Eve is on probation...

01:03:28.778 --> 01:03:30.827
since she set off those
fireworks at the old folks home.

01:03:30.976 --> 01:03:33.303
They gonna take her
away for good this time.

01:03:33.327 --> 01:03:34.939
- Exactly.
- What?

01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:39.392
This is all my fault.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.985
- No honey, no don't...
- No! Believe me. This is.

01:03:44.009 --> 01:03:46.040
What's important is
that we locate Eve.

01:03:46.064 --> 01:03:46.993
Alright?

01:03:49.142 --> 01:03:50.915
What if we just went next door?

01:03:51.196 --> 01:03:52.811
You know and see what they
know about Zack disappearing.

01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:54.587
It has to be more than a coincidence.

01:03:54.611 --> 01:03:56.157
Yeah. That's what Dr. Mike suggested.

01:03:56.181 --> 01:03:57.243
Okay! Great!

01:03:57.525 --> 01:03:58.954
- Oh my God!
- What?

01:03:58.978 --> 01:04:00.462
It's so obvious.

01:04:00.486 --> 01:04:04.050
She's been kidnapped by
the psychopath next door.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:04.894
Bingo!

01:04:04.919 --> 01:04:06.919
- What?
- My little girl...

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.776
Abducted...

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.675
But her car is gone.

01:04:10.668 --> 01:04:12.988
Well he obviously stole
Eve's car when he took her.

01:04:13.012 --> 01:04:15.988
- But her note. What about that?
- Coercion. He forced her to write it.

01:04:16.012 --> 01:04:16.754
What?

01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:19.121
He probably put
a gun to her head, honey.

01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:21.082
No! Zack would never do that.

01:04:21.106 --> 01:04:23.106
You know what?
We're going over there right now!

01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:25.004
- Let's do this!
- Yeah! Let's go.

01:04:25.926 --> 01:04:27.926
- We're going?
- Joy! Come on! Hurry up!

01:04:28.044 --> 01:04:29.225
Okay.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.840
Joy: Shhh...

01:04:38.865 --> 01:04:40.806
Hey! No, no. Shh.

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:43.748
No, not the paw. Not the paw.
We don't know each other.

01:04:43.773 --> 01:04:45.526
Crazy dog really seems
to like you.

01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:47.830
Yeah, so weird. Shh...

01:04:56.795 --> 01:04:58.634
Hey! Put that down!

01:04:59.419 --> 01:05:01.082
We need to speak
to your father.

01:05:08.715 --> 01:05:09.921
Hi.

01:05:11.977 --> 01:05:13.906
I'm sorry, I'm staring.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.773
There's something
so familiar about you.

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:18.132
I um...

01:05:18.593 --> 01:05:20.445
I'm your next door neighbor.

01:05:20.652 --> 01:05:21.851
No, that's not it.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.570
Oh, I got it.

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.866
It's your eyes.
Do you see that?

01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:27.264
She's got my big brother's eyes.

01:05:27.688 --> 01:05:29.312
- Uncle Timmy.
- Yeah.

01:05:30.871 --> 01:05:32.125
How'd you know that?

01:05:32.338 --> 01:05:33.898
Uh, we need to talk.

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:36.820
Yeah, okay. Uh...

01:05:37.388 --> 01:05:38.562
Come on in.

01:05:41.726 --> 01:05:42.836
Put that down!

01:05:46.477 --> 01:05:47.257
Rod: Ugh.

01:05:47.828 --> 01:05:49.679
We heard that your son Zack
was missing.

01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:51.945
- Do you know where he is?
Marcie: Hardly.

01:05:52.596 --> 01:05:55.570
Rod: Our oldest daughter, Eve,
disappeared last night too.

01:05:55.988 --> 01:05:58.429
Bob: Huh. Well, uh, maybe they
ran off together?

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.117
Rod: We think that your son
abducted our daughter!

01:06:01.468 --> 01:06:03.375
- Excuse me?
- You heard me right.

01:06:03.588 --> 01:06:05.492
My son doesn't even
know your daughter.

01:06:05.679 --> 01:06:08.171
I mean, he's home-schooled.
He barely leaves the house.

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:10.187
What? He's home-schooled?

01:06:10.419 --> 01:06:12.140
That's why I never saw him
at Roosevelt.

01:06:12.191 --> 01:06:14.904
Zack and Eve have been Face
timing each other for months.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.630
They even have code names.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.232
He's Darth Vadar
and she's Lizzie Borden.

01:06:19.677 --> 01:06:22.427
- You see?!
- Okay, but that doesn't mean he abducted her.

01:06:22.463 --> 01:06:24.419
Joy: You know, maybe it's like
"Romeo and Juliet."

01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:26.904
Bob: Right there. Rod: I was thinking
more like "Natural Born Killers."

01:06:26.929 --> 01:06:28.724
Oh, that's Eve's
favorite movie.

01:06:29.012 --> 01:06:30.091
Okay. All right.

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:33.036
So let's say that they did
run off with each other.

01:06:33.721 --> 01:06:34.755
Did she leave a note?

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:35.943
Actually...

01:06:35.968 --> 01:06:38.466
Uh, we didn't come here
to be interrogated.

01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:39.919
We came here for information!

01:06:40.016 --> 01:06:41.786
Show us your son's room.

01:06:41.944 --> 01:06:43.588
There've gotta be some clues.

01:06:43.613 --> 01:06:45.267
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:47.869
Uh... come on up through here.

01:06:47.894 --> 01:06:50.572
Rod: Ugh... I can hardly wait.
Bob: Bit of a mess.

01:06:50.737 --> 01:06:52.632
Rod: A bit of a mess?
Bob: Little bit.

01:06:52.693 --> 01:06:54.822
Rod and Marcie: Ugh.
Miles: Relax.

01:06:56.714 --> 01:06:58.211
Bob: I wouldn't lean too heavy
on that.

01:06:58.236 --> 01:06:59.526
That's ready to come down.

01:06:59.734 --> 01:07:00.838
Rod: Really, Bob?

01:07:00.863 --> 01:07:02.189
Bob: Yup, yup.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.807
Now, uh, uh...

01:07:03.972 --> 01:07:06.735
Keep in mind we're behind
on housekeeping.

01:07:07.248 --> 01:07:08.916
Joy: It's okay.

01:07:09.244 --> 01:07:10.718
Rod: What?
Bob: Uh...

01:07:15.278 --> 01:07:16.761
What is going on
in there?

01:07:16.956 --> 01:07:19.073
Uh, uh... it's-it's okay.
They're, they're harmless.

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:21.261
You know, friendly actually.

01:07:21.286 --> 01:07:23.472
Miles: They're lab rats.
We raise 'em for money.

01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:24.746
- Joy: My room...
- Marcie: Ugh...

01:07:24.771 --> 01:07:25.543
Yeah.

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:29.865
Uh, see, I got laid off from
the ad agency last year

01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:32.279
and so, uh, we do this
for the university.

01:07:32.304 --> 01:07:34.357
It brings in a little bit
of extra cash.

01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:37.091
I wanted to raise llamas
but they're too big.

01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:37.935
What?!

01:07:38.365 --> 01:07:39.880
Bob: Thanks, Miles. That's good.
Miles: You're welcome.

01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:41.185
Bob: All right, uh... yeah.

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:42.998
And, uh, there's Zack's room.
Go ahead.

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.334
Please feel free to...

01:07:47.065 --> 01:07:47.785
Hmm.

01:07:49.909 --> 01:07:51.512
What the hell?

01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:54.132
His favorite band is
"Satan's Sandals!"

01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:55.871
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:55.954 --> 01:07:57.051
Bob: Real sad.

01:07:57.108 --> 01:07:58.942
Not uh... not a lot of upbeat
hits.

01:07:58.967 --> 01:08:01.485
Well, I'm really smelling those
socks right about now, so...

01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:02.719
seen enough?
Marcie: Mm-hmm.

01:08:02.744 --> 01:08:04.185
Rod: Yeah, we've seen plenty,
Bob.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.110
Bob: Good. Let's get you
to the door.

01:08:06.173 --> 01:08:07.789
Rod: Still a lot of questions
for you.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.875
Bob: Ask away.
Rod: A lot of questions.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.151
Bob: You can ask them from the lawn.
Rob: Yeah, fine.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.957
All: Oh!

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:25.502
Bob and Joy: Miles!
Miles: What?

01:08:25.527 --> 01:08:28.993
Marcie: I hurt my back.
And my neck, and my elbow.

01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:30.535
Rod: Oh, I knew we shouldn't
have come over here!

01:08:30.559 --> 01:08:31.721
Well, who asked you to?!

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.933
I'm gonna call the police
And tell them about Eve!

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.207
- Oh, don't you dare!
- No!

01:08:35.232 --> 01:08:36.808
Miles: Their names are Salt
and Pepper.

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.425
Who wants to say hello?
Bob: Miles!

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:41.904
Get me outta here! Please!

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.858
Bob: Hey, uh,
come over anytime.

01:08:43.883 --> 01:08:45.397
Marcie: Ow! This hurts.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.256
You'll hear from my lawyer.

01:08:47.448 --> 01:08:48.819
Bob: It's the eyes.

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:53.819
Miles...

01:08:54.153 --> 01:08:56.576
I still don't see why
I can't help find Eve.

01:08:56.639 --> 01:08:57.772
There's nothing you can do.

01:08:57.898 --> 01:08:59.381
Plus athletes need to be
in school

01:08:59.406 --> 01:09:00.319
or they can't play.

01:09:00.381 --> 01:09:01.865
- You know that.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.157 --> 01:09:05.256
Now I've gotta take your mother
to the hospital for X-Rays.

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:07.729
We've talked to the lawyers...

01:09:07.754 --> 01:09:11.182
Come on. Do you have to file
a second lawsuit?

01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:14.408
They don't look like
they have deep pockets.

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:16.773
Worst case scenario,
we force them into bankruptcy

01:09:16.798 --> 01:09:17.939
and they move.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.502
Best case scenario,
they have good insurance,

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:22.182
we collect a bundle of cash
and we move.

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:23.837
Either way,
we're no longer neighbors.

01:09:23.863 --> 01:09:24.768
I just...

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.143
I just don't get why
we all can't get along.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.479
Feel better, Mom.

01:09:31.504 --> 01:09:33.740
Marcie:
Oh, thank you, honey.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.169
Honey, it can't...
It can't be that bad.

01:09:37.194 --> 01:09:38.716
It's so bad.

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:46.897
Hey, Sam.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.020
Look, I'm sorry about the thing
at the pep rally, okay?

01:09:50.046 --> 01:09:51.934
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:55.231
Or Mimi.

01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:57.278
She broke up with me.

01:09:57.754 --> 01:09:58.848
Oh my gosh.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.910
Do you wanna tell the whole
school that now, too?

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.629
It should get another big laugh.

01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:07.264
Sam, come on.

01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:09.717
- See ya.
- I really am sorry!

01:10:11.262 --> 01:10:13.084
Sam, we need to talk!

01:10:16.235 --> 01:10:18.443
Coach Weber: I know, she's let
us down. I know, it's brutal.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:19.857
- Hey!
- Stop.

01:10:19.922 --> 01:10:20.967
What?

01:10:21.599 --> 01:10:22.974
Joy, we need to talk.

01:10:23.449 --> 01:10:24.341
Okay.

01:10:24.514 --> 01:10:25.834
Do you wanna do it
in my office

01:10:25.859 --> 01:10:27.666
or in front of your team?

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:33.033
Bring it on.

01:10:33.177 --> 01:10:34.749
Well, you're not playing
in the match tonight.

01:10:34.805 --> 01:10:35.812
How 'bout that?
Girl: Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:10:35.907 --> 01:10:37.534
What? What-what did I do?

01:10:37.675 --> 01:10:40.136
It's more like what
you didn't do, Joy.

01:10:40.433 --> 01:10:43.214
'Kay, academic eligibility
is the one thing

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.955
that can trip you up
in this system.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.048
You know that.

01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:50.087
Rewind. Uh...
Academic eligibility?

01:10:50.469 --> 01:10:51.219
Girls: Yeah!

01:10:51.252 --> 01:10:53.744
Come on. You guys only need
a "C" average to play.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:54.919
Oh my gosh...

01:10:54.944 --> 01:10:56.583
Are they right?

01:10:57.645 --> 01:10:58.739
Guess what?

01:11:01.832 --> 01:11:03.982
I don't have a "C" average?!

01:11:05.114 --> 01:11:07.030
She's making it super hard,
isn't she?

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.069
You guys are kidding
right now, right?

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.465
I-I am smart!

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:16.473
I am that kid who uses pen
for math

01:11:16.498 --> 01:11:18.786
because no mistakes right here,
hmm?

01:11:18.994 --> 01:11:20.794
I own the honor roll!

01:11:21.314 --> 01:11:22.762
- You're crazy, okay?
- What?

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:24.669
- Seriously?
- I know things!

01:11:25.274 --> 01:11:26.766
A lot of things!

01:11:26.799 --> 01:11:29.651
Okay, you have put yourself,
this team

01:11:29.716 --> 01:11:32.321
and the entire school
in a terrible position,

01:11:32.419 --> 01:11:34.657
and your dad cannot get you
out of it this time.

01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:37.321
So what do you have to say
for yourself, Joy?

01:11:37.772 --> 01:11:39.274
We're all ears.

01:11:44.211 --> 01:11:45.915
I have a massive headache.

01:11:45.952 --> 01:11:47.321
Not my problem.

01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:49.641
Super disappointed.

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.064
Girls: Great!
Thanks for everything.

01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:52.251
Coach Weber: Joy?

01:11:52.777 --> 01:11:55.913
Joy! Unbelievable!

01:12:06.183 --> 01:12:10.341
Look, I'm really sorry,
you guys.

01:12:24.043 --> 01:12:25.372
Announcement: Don't forget
to buy your tickets

01:12:25.397 --> 01:12:27.722
to see the Griffins play in the
State Volleyball Championships.

01:12:27.747 --> 01:12:28.882
Support your team.

01:12:28.907 --> 01:12:30.599
Go Griffins!

01:12:32.921 --> 01:12:34.700
Mr. Elderberry?

01:12:34.755 --> 01:12:37.358
Mr. Elderberry!
Yes?

01:12:38.296 --> 01:12:40.225
I wanna play the clarinet.

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:42.413
The clarinet isn't
the easiest instrument.

01:12:42.616 --> 01:12:44.003
Maybe you could ask your parents

01:12:44.039 --> 01:12:45.172
to get you piano lessons.

01:12:45.197 --> 01:12:46.478
I already did that.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.770
- So you play the piano?
- Well, ages ago.

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.775
Almost like another lifetime.

01:12:51.419 --> 01:12:53.662
- Do you read music?
- Before. Not now.

01:12:53.687 --> 01:12:55.337
But I can pick it up
really fast.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.085
I'm sure of that.

01:12:57.354 --> 01:12:59.179
It's not too late to start,
is it?

01:13:00.123 --> 01:13:02.046
I'm retiring next semester.

01:13:02.289 --> 01:13:05.914
The next teacher might have
more... energy.

01:13:06.289 --> 01:13:07.547
Take it up with her.

01:13:08.352 --> 01:13:09.773
You're retiring?

01:13:10.672 --> 01:13:13.852
Teaching tone deaf teenagers
leads to clinical depression.

01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:16.334
It's a life sentence
of sour notes.

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:18.242
I just can't do it anymore.

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:19.392
Bye, bye.

01:13:21.573 --> 01:13:23.622
Who the hell was that?

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.944
Hey! Montana!

01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:36.239
- Yo, baby.
- Ugh!

01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:39.756
You said you'd meet me
before class.

01:13:39.846 --> 01:13:41.645
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm getting so worried!

01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.182
- I know, I'm sorry. Um...
- Just shaking inside.

01:13:44.207 --> 01:13:46.629
Things have been rough.

01:13:47.364 --> 01:13:49.090
Eve ran away from home
last night.

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:51.543
So did the boy who lives
next door.

01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:54.848
The boy next door?

01:13:55.075 --> 01:13:57.772
Yeah. Zack Hockstatter.

01:13:58.194 --> 01:13:59.952
He's home schooled though.
You wouldn't know him.

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:02.586
So you care more about
some neighbor dude than me?

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.991
What? I-I didn't just say
that.

01:14:05.016 --> 01:14:06.627
I said that he and Eve
disappeared.

01:14:06.665 --> 01:14:09.391
Oh. Okay, so I just made up that
there's some guy who lives next door

01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:10.815
and you're upset about him.
Maybe you wanna go to his cabin.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.643
- Maybe you already have.
- Tom, stop.

01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:14.135
Can you calm down please?

01:14:14.393 --> 01:14:16.504
It's nothing like that, okay?

01:14:18.103 --> 01:14:19.918
Don't act like it doesn't
mean anything to you

01:14:19.965 --> 01:14:22.692
to be going out with the
hottest guy in school.

01:14:23.465 --> 01:14:24.583
Me.

01:14:25.285 --> 01:14:28.129
Can I ask you something?

01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:29.286
How um...

01:14:29.846 --> 01:14:33.637
how did Eve running away
from home become about you?

01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:38.207
What'd you just say?

01:14:39.383 --> 01:14:40.152
Um...

01:14:42.559 --> 01:14:43.715
Answer me!

01:14:46.116 --> 01:14:47.577
Oh no! Oh...

01:14:47.612 --> 01:14:48.743
Is he alive?

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:51.459
Uh... um...

01:14:52.874 --> 01:14:55.017
he's breathing.

01:14:55.938 --> 01:14:57.680
He's so good-looking.

01:14:57.923 --> 01:15:01.845
Yeah, especially when
his mouth is closed.

01:15:04.944 --> 01:15:08.602
Hey, uh, you learned CPR
last summer, right?

01:15:22.962 --> 01:15:24.619
His heart rate seems normal.

01:15:24.814 --> 01:15:26.142
Oh. Well, uh...

01:15:26.908 --> 01:15:29.033
maybe he needs mouth-to-mouth.

01:15:44.694 --> 01:15:45.925
Nice work.

01:15:46.829 --> 01:15:48.529
Oh, good luck.
Hmm.

01:15:48.554 --> 01:15:50.389
Oh, 'scuse me!

01:15:50.414 --> 01:15:51.532
Girl: Did you hear the news?!

01:15:51.557 --> 01:15:54.837
Eve Wellman and a kid named
Zack Hockstatter are barricaded

01:15:54.862 --> 01:15:57.384
in the convenience store
on Emerald Street!

01:15:59.947 --> 01:16:01.340
Oh my God...

01:16:04.478 --> 01:16:06.207
Okay, okay...

01:16:06.324 --> 01:16:08.472
Ugh! I gotta change. Ugh.

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:10.110
Okay.

01:16:10.135 --> 01:16:11.263
Here.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:13.879
Ungh!

01:16:14.185 --> 01:16:15.146
Okay...

01:16:15.951 --> 01:16:17.474
I gotta help them.

01:16:17.755 --> 01:16:18.927
Okay.

01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:20.083
Other shoe.

01:16:20.412 --> 01:16:21.802
Oh God, I'm really flipping...

01:16:23.807 --> 01:16:26.078
Okay. Ungh! Okay.

01:16:26.103 --> 01:16:27.258
Okay.

01:16:27.532 --> 01:16:29.141
Here we go, here we go.

01:16:29.305 --> 01:16:31.078
Okay, you can help. Okay.

01:16:31.555 --> 01:16:32.633
Excuse me!

01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:34.492
Okay, okay...

01:16:58.225 --> 01:16:59.350
Man: Dude, what's going on?

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:01.866
You come out now
and everything will be okay!

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:04.483
Dispatch: Officer Crowley,
what is your status?

01:17:05.926 --> 01:17:08.162
Yeah, we followed them here,
now they won't come out.

01:17:08.187 --> 01:17:09.592
So we're sending in
a SWAT unit.

01:17:09.617 --> 01:17:11.593
Hey, hey! You can't go any
closer!

01:17:11.618 --> 01:17:13.100
Officer: Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- My sister -

01:17:13.361 --> 01:17:15.037
and my brother - are in there!

01:17:15.062 --> 01:17:16.420
Officers: Miss, miss, stop!

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:18.826
Zack?! Eve!

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:25.897
We have to go inside, my daughter's
in here. Officer: Come on.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:27.686
Marcie: Please, just listen.
Rod: Okay, what's happening?

01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:29.167
Oh my gosh,
you guys are okay.

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:30.568
What're you doing here?!

01:17:30.892 --> 01:17:33.230
Me?! What about you?!

01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:34.980
Someone thought we needed
some supplies

01:17:35.005 --> 01:17:36.918
for our little road trip.
Next thing we know...

01:17:37.463 --> 01:17:38.832
- we're surrounded by cops!
- Joy: Wait a second.

01:17:38.857 --> 01:17:40.441
Is that Dad's old BB gun?

01:17:40.863 --> 01:17:43.301
- M-My Dad or-or your Dad?
- Oh shoot.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:46.051
That's just a BB gun?
What else have you lied about?!

01:17:46.076 --> 01:17:46.918
I haven't lied to you
about anything!

01:17:46.943 --> 01:17:49.422
I cannot believe that
you guys ran away from home!

01:17:49.501 --> 01:17:51.617
Eve: I didn't run away
from home, okay?

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.203
I ran away from you.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.593
Oh, that's really nice.
Thank you.

01:17:54.618 --> 01:17:56.121
Guys, guys,
this could get ugly.

01:17:56.159 --> 01:17:58.317
Could? It already has.

01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:01.528
Look, Joy,
you need to help us.

01:18:01.553 --> 01:18:03.683
- Help you?
- Just they'll listen to you. Just...

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.822
I don't know, tell them
it was all a misunderstanding.

01:18:06.437 --> 01:18:08.080
- A misunderstanding.
- Yeah.

01:18:08.111 --> 01:18:10.165
This is a misunderstanding?

01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:12.540
Please? Okay, you owe me this.

01:18:12.849 --> 01:18:14.275
We're sisters.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:20.101
Wait.

01:18:22.447 --> 01:18:23.718
Can you turn that up?

01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:25.437
Sorry.

01:18:25.753 --> 01:18:26.866
Can you turn that up?

01:18:26.908 --> 01:18:28.226
What? What? Turn what up?

01:18:28.758 --> 01:18:31.444
The music.
Can you make it louder?

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:33.483
Joy, this isn't exactly
the time to play holiday DJ.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.812
Zack, I am telling you,
I know this song.

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:37.187
Everybody knows this song!

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:40.050
No. I used to play it
on my clarinet.

01:18:47.675 --> 01:18:49.398
They have Ah Cards?

01:18:49.595 --> 01:18:52.966
Officer Crowley: Why don't you
tell us exactly what you want!

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.076
These cards hold our secrets.

01:18:57.326 --> 01:18:58.904
Who says that we have
secrets?

01:18:58.929 --> 01:19:00.579
She's clearly not gonna be
any help.

01:19:00.623 --> 01:19:02.822
Joy, can we please focus
on the problem at hand?

01:19:02.847 --> 01:19:03.900
I'm trying, okay?

01:19:03.925 --> 01:19:05.201
Here. Pick a card.

01:19:05.838 --> 01:19:06.947
Forget it.

01:19:06.972 --> 01:19:08.986
Okay, you know what? Fine.
I'll do it.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.141
Thanks.

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:12.211
- Family.
- Yeah,

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:13.469
the source of all
of our problems.

01:19:13.494 --> 01:19:15.649
- You got that right.
- Okay, Zack, here.

01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:16.829
Pick a card.

01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:18.454
No.

01:19:19.099 --> 01:19:20.617
Fine! I'll do it.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.469
Love.

01:19:24.001 --> 01:19:25.258
Not really my thing.

01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:26.484
Really?

01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:32.016
Change...

01:19:36.259 --> 01:19:37.289
Oh no...

01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:39.602
Zack! Eve!

01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:41.602
Eve: I can't breathe!

01:19:42.398 --> 01:19:43.860
Zack: Now do you believe
that we're toast?

01:20:00.828 --> 01:20:01.968
Dr. Mike: Do you hear me, Joy?

01:20:02.045 --> 01:20:03.531
Blink your eyes if you hear me.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.078
Do you understand?
Blink your eyes if you do.

01:20:14.804 --> 01:20:15.994
Is it um...

01:20:17.611 --> 01:20:19.392
Is it okay if I just talk?

01:20:28.285 --> 01:20:29.689
Where am I?

01:20:30.266 --> 01:20:31.992
You're in the hospital.
You had an accident,

01:20:32.017 --> 01:20:33.361
but you're okay.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.509
I don't feel okay.

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:37.127
No.

01:20:38.051 --> 01:20:39.654
But you will, I promise.

01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:43.373
I don't...

01:20:45.053 --> 01:20:46.787
I don't remember anything.

01:20:48.158 --> 01:20:49.373
Do you know who you are?

01:20:53.309 --> 01:20:54.037
No.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.459
It's okay.

01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.791
Now I wanna show you
some people.

01:20:58.540 --> 01:20:59.743
I think it's gonna help.

01:21:00.452 --> 01:21:01.893
- 'Kay.
- Okay?

01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:55.908
Dr. Mike: Do you remember now?

01:22:05.434 --> 01:22:07.053
I'm Joy...

01:22:07.646 --> 01:22:08.655
Dr. Mike: Yes.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.840
Joy Hockstatter...

01:22:17.902 --> 01:22:20.428
Bob: Rod: Aw...
Marcie: Yes!

01:22:21.217 --> 01:22:22.539
Daddy!

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.483
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:30.818
Hi. Hi, buddy.

01:22:30.897 --> 01:22:32.041
I'm here...

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.782
Hi. Look at you.

01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:38.845
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

01:22:57.087 --> 01:22:59.009
Well, I guess we got you back

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.745
just in time for Christmas, huh?

01:23:03.616 --> 01:23:06.284
But... where did the banner
come from?

01:23:06.407 --> 01:23:08.776
Oh, that? A group of girls
from school

01:23:08.823 --> 01:23:09.939
brought it last week.

01:23:09.964 --> 01:23:11.646
They're cheerleaders!

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:13.872
That's right.
Yeah, they were very nice.

01:23:13.919 --> 01:23:16.394
Although one of them -
little pushy.

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.958
- Yeah.
- Ahh... Brie?

01:23:18.085 --> 01:23:21.063
That's the one, yeah.
Named after a cheese.

01:23:22.651 --> 01:23:25.408
It's okay. Montana came,
got her out of here.

01:23:25.766 --> 01:23:28.306
Yeah, and a soccer
player stopped by.

01:23:28.377 --> 01:23:30.862
That's right, he did.
Tom somebody.

01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:33.706
Tom Addison came to see me?

01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:35.081
- That's the one.
- Yeah.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.625
He said he was getting
community service credit.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:40.422
Good.

01:23:41.455 --> 01:23:44.119
I'm gonna go and turn on the
lights on our Christmas tree.

01:23:44.262 --> 01:23:47.822
Joy, you can't believe
how cool it looks!

01:23:47.994 --> 01:23:49.783
- Can't wait.
- All right, be careful!

01:23:49.808 --> 01:23:51.457
- Great.
- See you in the house!

01:24:00.753 --> 01:24:02.362
Wait, what are they doing
together?

01:24:02.566 --> 01:24:04.353
They spent a lot of time
together at the hospital.

01:24:04.378 --> 01:24:05.939
I guess something must have
just clicked.

01:24:08.206 --> 01:24:09.784
Wow.
Yeah. Let's go say hi.

01:24:10.049 --> 01:24:11.106
Yeah.

01:24:12.318 --> 01:24:14.279
Hey, big bro.
Hey.

01:24:15.888 --> 01:24:17.263
Are you feeling okay?

01:24:17.905 --> 01:24:19.935
- Yes.
- Well, you're looking a boatload better.

01:24:20.671 --> 01:24:21.593
Thanks.

01:24:23.086 --> 01:24:24.687
Come here.

01:24:27.445 --> 01:24:28.601
Zack: All right, that's enough.

01:24:28.626 --> 01:24:30.461
I can only take so much
of this touchy-feely stuff.

01:24:30.658 --> 01:24:31.697
Okay.

01:24:34.119 --> 01:24:35.861
- Joy?
- Yeah.

01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:39.316
It really is good
to have you home.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.372
It's so good to have you
back, honey.

01:24:53.185 --> 01:24:54.357
We all love you.

01:24:55.122 --> 01:24:57.333
Me, too, you!

01:24:58.346 --> 01:25:00.567
- I'll take your stuff inside.
- Okay.

01:25:04.161 --> 01:25:05.715
Dad, I missed you.

01:25:08.327 --> 01:25:09.663
Me, too, you.

01:25:36.362 --> 01:25:39.196
- Hey! You're home!
- Yeah.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.802
- How're you feeling?
- Good.

01:25:42.364 --> 01:25:44.114
Really good, actually.

01:25:44.866 --> 01:25:46.618
Well, Marcie's gonna be
so glad you're home.

01:25:46.658 --> 01:25:48.618
And she's loved
taking care of Levi.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:51.538
Levi!

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:52.352
Marcie: Wait!

01:25:52.774 --> 01:25:53.798
Hi!

01:25:54.165 --> 01:25:55.345
Hi. Muah!

01:25:55.493 --> 01:25:57.267
I missed you!
Marcie: Joy!

01:25:57.292 --> 01:25:58.605
Welcome home.

01:25:58.761 --> 01:26:01.714
Thank you. It is so good
to be back.

01:26:02.581 --> 01:26:03.558
Truly.

01:26:04.446 --> 01:26:07.759
I missed everybody... so much.

01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:11.618
Well, somebody's ready
for their walk.

01:26:12.434 --> 01:26:14.298
I've been walking him
since the accident.

01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:16.253
Miles and I go together.

01:26:17.027 --> 01:26:18.029
Wow.

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:19.816
You know, I um...

01:26:20.346 --> 01:26:22.933
I was wondering if you'd ever wanna
go on a run with me sometime?

01:26:23.394 --> 01:26:26.787
Yeah, I'd like that. A lot.

01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:29.115
Me too.

01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:31.031
We'll see you tomorrow
for Christmas dinner.

01:26:31.474 --> 01:26:33.404
We're having Christmas dinner
together?

01:26:33.537 --> 01:26:35.553
Yeah. I always wanted
more people

01:26:35.578 --> 01:26:37.141
around the holiday table,

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.766
and now, finally,
my wish is coming true.

01:26:40.391 --> 01:26:41.727
See you later.
Well, see you tomorrow.

01:26:41.758 --> 01:26:43.555
- Have fun!
- Come on!

01:26:52.459 --> 01:26:53.990
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

01:27:05.774 --> 01:27:07.628
Hey.

01:27:07.736 --> 01:27:09.244
Hey. Here.

01:27:10.583 --> 01:27:13.338
Ah! Thank you.

01:27:14.525 --> 01:27:15.861
So, um...

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.884
were you really at the hospital
every day when I was sick?

01:27:20.269 --> 01:27:21.449
Yeah.

01:27:23.407 --> 01:27:24.761
That's pretty cool.

01:27:26.206 --> 01:27:27.683
I mean, I got a lot
of work done.

01:27:28.388 --> 01:27:30.863
- Yeah?
- They don't have a very secure system.

01:27:31.364 --> 01:27:33.726
Oh. Does anyone?

01:27:34.705 --> 01:27:36.116
I mean really?

01:27:38.449 --> 01:27:39.374
Joy?

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.522
Yeah?

01:27:43.812 --> 01:27:46.119
I'll pick one of your
Ah cards if you want me to.

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:49.775
No. That's cool.

01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:53.588
I got the same card a lot.

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:55.765
It sort of freaked me out.

01:27:55.996 --> 01:27:57.086
Really?

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.054
I'm good with it now.

01:28:03.522 --> 01:28:04.743
Me, too.

01:28:06.506 --> 01:28:07.946
Merry Christmas, Sam.

01:28:10.454 --> 01:28:11.735
