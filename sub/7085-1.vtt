<i>He told me "whomever amongst us who's
killed as a martyr should go to paradise</i>

01:35.563 --> 01:38.999
<i>to lead the luxurious life
that he's never seen."</i>

01:39.099 --> 01:41.769
<i>"God is great" he repeats.</i>

01:41.869 --> 01:44.371
<i>No one knows how long
the battle will continue,</i>

01:44.471 --> 01:47.900
<i>but in a country long ravaged
with poverty, anger and violence,</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:52.146
<i>one thing is certain, there will always be
those willing to pay the ultimate price,</i>

01:52.246 --> 01:54.826
<i>to make their voices heard.</i>

02:06.292 --> 02:08.701
Would you like a brochure?

02:09.294 --> 02:12.017
Hi, sir, would you like a brochure?

02:14.867 --> 02:16.470
Hi, sir.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.158
Would you like a brochure?

02:21.708 --> 02:24.044
Would you like a brochure?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.885
Sir?

02:35.121 --> 02:36.590
Okay, then.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.888
- Hi, ma'am, would you like a brochure?
- No thank you.

02:45.131 --> 02:49.803
So you've outlined the absent father,
bipolar mother, self harm issues,

02:49.903 --> 02:53.340
and history of previous suicide attempts.

02:53.734 --> 02:56.310
Yep, toxicology off the charts.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.712
Poor thing.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.983
And on the day...

03:02.783 --> 03:05.319
you were the person who signed her out
as being okay to leave.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.720
Yes, I did.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.837
- Which is... which is...
- Yeah, I...

03:14.827 --> 03:17.923
Travis, is there something that you...

03:21.050 --> 03:23.903
want to add to the file?

03:25.072 --> 03:29.714
About her condition or any of the symptoms
that she may have presented?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.257
Do you know what she asked me one time?

03:35.115 --> 03:37.552
She asked me...

03:38.252 --> 03:41.767
if I thought it was possible
to treat someone's soul.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.926
Do you think that...

03:46.026 --> 03:48.096
that we can treat someone's soul?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.948
I know. I know.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.872
It's just I look at these people
across the table and...

03:58.222 --> 04:01.998
and I can see that there's something
in there that I'm missing.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.429
And I don't know what the fuck it is.

04:05.529 --> 04:07.765
- Travis...
- We talked about her life, okay?

04:07.865 --> 04:10.788
Not her file because for once in my life
I wanted to help someone

04:10.888 --> 04:13.304
in this fucking place.

04:13.404 --> 04:15.745
Travis, look, it is tough,

04:15.845 --> 04:18.404
I get it. But this is our job.

04:19.043 --> 04:21.410
We treat sick people.

04:21.510 --> 04:24.815
And I know you must be feeling like there
was something you could've done but...

04:24.915 --> 04:27.291
No, you're wrong.

04:27.818 --> 04:30.285
I don't feel anything.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.971
I can't feel anything.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.537
But thank you.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.885
- Good morning, Trevor.
- Morning, Doctor Bell.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.383
So, Rachel...

04:55.612 --> 04:58.447
Hi, there. I'm Doctor Bell.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.302
How's your week been?

05:01.652 --> 05:04.188
- Good.
- Good.

05:04.488 --> 05:09.723
And the medication, you've been
on the new medication for...

05:10.360 --> 05:13.503
About a month now, do we need
to make any adjustments?

05:13.831 --> 05:16.456
No. I feel better.

05:16.556 --> 05:20.780
Better. And are you sleeping
uninterrupted through the night?

05:25.441 --> 05:28.312
And on a scale of one to ten,

05:28.412 --> 05:32.116
how would you rate
Tuesday night's lasagne?

05:33.316 --> 05:36.404
- A seven.
- Seven. Interesting.

05:36.504 --> 05:40.699
I would have gone with eight. I thought
they did something pretty special there.

05:50.032 --> 05:52.603
A few days ago
I was down south at a party.

05:52.703 --> 05:55.105
I'd had a few beers, a pill,

05:55.205 --> 05:58.797
- bit to smoke, but I was cool.
- Okay.

05:58.897 --> 06:01.578
So... so I go to the kitchen,
to find some ice, and...

06:01.678 --> 06:05.845
- You took ice as well?
- For my beverage, relax, dude.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.169
Okay. Sorry.

06:09.269 --> 06:12.956
I turn around, and God
and the devil are standing there.

06:13.056 --> 06:16.873
God goes out to the patio and the devil's
standing right there behind me.

06:16.973 --> 06:19.519
- With big horns.
- That's interesting.

06:19.619 --> 06:22.095
Yeah. And I said to the devil, mate...

06:22.195 --> 06:24.518
you have no love in your life,
that's the trouble with you.

06:25.168 --> 06:27.204
That's why you do what you do.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.241
Devil couldn't forgive himself.
That's the message, man. Bring love.

06:31.341 --> 06:34.925
Wait. What did the devil
have to forgive himself for?

06:35.245 --> 06:39.216
- Have to ask him yourself, mate.
- No, Dean, seriously.

06:39.316 --> 06:43.258
What do you think that the devil
had to forgive himself for?

07:28.563 --> 07:30.000
Hello?

07:30.100 --> 07:33.270
<i>Hi. I just... I was
in the city and I just...</i>

07:33.370 --> 07:37.284
- Who is this?
- <i>I'm sorry, it's Rachel.</i>

07:37.384 --> 07:38.411
Rachel?

07:39.610 --> 07:43.387
- <i>We met at the hospital, the other day...</i>
- How did you get this number?

07:43.487 --> 07:46.360
<i>I was just in the city and I...
I was walking around and...</i>

07:46.460 --> 07:49.634
- Are you okay?
- <i>I just think I need to see someone.</i>

08:03.599 --> 08:06.917
I was walking around
and it started to rain.

08:07.304 --> 08:11.741
And... then I couldn't think
what it was that I needed.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.228
And then I remembered.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.931
But it's gone again.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.587
- Well, how's your week been?
- Special.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.655
- Oh, yeah.
- Very special.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.238
Do you want to tell me about it?

08:45.474 --> 08:49.179
I have these... intense feelings.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.864
- Do you want to talk to me about them?
- No, I don't want to talk about them.

09:00.089 --> 09:01.845
Sorry?

09:01.945 --> 09:04.441
I didn't say anything.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.597
You didn't?

09:06.697 --> 09:10.336
It's not like that,
it's... it's... It's more...

09:10.436 --> 09:12.718
It's more...

09:14.470 --> 09:17.674
Oh, God. No.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.543
- No?
- No.

09:19.743 --> 09:22.846
I sort of was going up
and down all the time,

09:22.946 --> 09:26.080
fluctuating with moods and...

09:26.180 --> 09:29.120
anxiety and depression, so in general...

09:29.220 --> 09:33.366
Just being overwhelmed like a tidal wave
had come over me,

09:33.466 --> 09:38.508
with so much new things
that took me to a dark place.

09:42.232 --> 09:46.321
I was exhausted, confused
and angry, and I had...

09:48.739 --> 09:51.295
I was exhausted...

09:58.764 --> 10:00.599
Dude.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.407
I'm sorry. I lost my train of thought.

10:07.457 --> 10:10.293
Train fucking derailed more like it.
Toot toot, Trav!

10:10.393 --> 10:12.629
Doctor. Okay, Dean?

10:12.729 --> 10:15.999
In this room, I'm doctor.

10:16.099 --> 10:18.137
I've got a question.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.929
Why are you doing this, man? Trav? Doc?

10:22.029 --> 10:23.540
Doing what?

10:23.640 --> 10:27.724
Nah, nah, come on, I'm asking. Serious.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.947
You're smart.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.324
You scrub up alright.
You could do what you want.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.989
Well, I don't want to do anything else.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.868
Helping make you feel good?

10:43.259 --> 10:45.825
Satisfied patients.

10:47.796 --> 10:51.568
- Let's talk about you, hey, Dean?
- No, no, let's talk about you.

10:52.068 --> 10:56.633
'Cause, I've heard something.
People have been talking, mate.

10:57.639 --> 11:03.367
Last week we were... we were
talking about you at the party...

11:04.030 --> 11:06.266
Not flash, brother.

11:06.366 --> 11:10.059
Doesn't inspire confidence
in the clientele, does it?

11:12.254 --> 11:14.891
Okay, Dean, well, we'll start
working when you're ready.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.027
One of your favorites.

11:17.127 --> 11:19.272
That's what I heard.

11:19.372 --> 11:21.390
That's cool.

11:21.490 --> 11:24.334
- She was mine too.
- Shut the fuck up, hey, Dean?

11:24.434 --> 11:28.638
Thought it was a bit harsh. Not exactly,
"Thank you, Doctor Travis", was it?

11:28.738 --> 11:32.077
No, Rachel...

11:37.880 --> 11:42.479
No, no, no, no, no! No!

11:54.263 --> 11:55.873
Dean is one of those patients

11:55.973 --> 11:59.136
- that can get under your skin.
- We both know it's not about him.

11:59.536 --> 12:01.504
Alright, then.

12:01.604 --> 12:03.940
Perhaps we should start by discussing
how you're coping...

12:04.040 --> 12:06.593
Was there something specific...

12:06.693 --> 12:09.326
you wanted to talk to me about?

12:11.280 --> 12:13.171
We think it would be best
for everyone if you...

12:13.271 --> 12:17.602
We? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that there was somebody else here.

12:19.588 --> 12:22.025
Take a couple of weeks and think about...

12:22.125 --> 12:24.495
A couple of weeks.

12:24.795 --> 12:26.997
You firing me?

12:27.497 --> 12:30.817
- No, I'm not firing anyone!
- Just tell me. I can take it.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.613
I'm saying, take two or three weeks.

12:36.488 --> 12:39.686
What... Oh, Jesus, Trav!

12:48.150 --> 12:50.520
I tried to protect you.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.224
Right?

12:56.658 --> 12:58.613
Doctor?

13:09.538 --> 13:12.112
Hi, there, would you like a brochure?

13:13.275 --> 13:15.989
Excuse me, would you like
something to read?

13:16.778 --> 13:19.639
Would you like to ask a question with me?

13:21.717 --> 13:24.769
Ma'am, would you like
to ask a question with me?

13:26.822 --> 13:29.139
How about you, sir?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.719
Sir?

13:34.129 --> 13:35.937
What?

13:36.732 --> 13:38.665
Do you ever find yourself alone,

13:38.765 --> 13:42.450
or abandoned or in pain,
you could come and speak to us.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.491
There's a meeting tonight
if you wanted to come.

13:47.877 --> 13:50.253
I'm busy tonight.

13:50.713 --> 13:52.348
That's a shame.

14:15.300 --> 14:20.391
<i>Hey. It doesn't have to be now,
but pick up once.</i>

14:23.945 --> 14:26.896
<i>Okay, I'm going to keep trying you.</i>

14:30.119 --> 14:32.317
<i>I was discharged today.</i>

14:33.823 --> 14:35.851
I know.

14:36.226 --> 14:40.731
My dad came and collected me
from the hospital... took me home.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.667
They redecorated my old bedroom.

14:44.767 --> 14:49.046
Put all my old trophies up on the shelf.
Like a shrine.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.909
Violin.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.196
I played violin.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.724
Played?

14:58.124 --> 15:00.417
Why'd you stop?

15:00.517 --> 15:04.321
I wanted to see if I could be someone
other than a girl who plays the violin.

15:04.421 --> 15:05.956
Right.

15:06.056 --> 15:09.705
- And can you?
- I don't know.

15:14.063 --> 15:16.415
What time is it?

15:18.266 --> 15:19.956
About three.

15:20.904 --> 15:23.636
I shouldn't be here, should I?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.697
No.

15:31.913 --> 15:34.817
I think I just needed someone to...
you know?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.834
Yeah. Of course.

15:39.455 --> 15:42.775
It must get lonely having to listen
to everyone's crap all the time.

15:42.875 --> 15:47.119
Actually it's a nice break
from all the crap inside my own head.

15:56.672 --> 16:00.454
I don't think that...
that's such a good idea.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.014
Hi, I'm Tom. What's your name?

16:36.114 --> 16:38.161
- Hey. I'm Travis.
- Good to meet you, Travis.

16:38.261 --> 16:41.598
- Just through here?
- Yeah. Just round to your right.

16:56.199 --> 16:59.971
<i>I've served.
I've done a tour of duty of Iraq.</i>

17:01.470 --> 17:03.546
<i>And I've seen the terror first hand.</i>

17:06.708 --> 17:09.709
<i>I saw it for what it was
and I saw what caused it.</i>

17:09.809 --> 17:11.337
<i>In this time of danger...</i>

17:12.448 --> 17:16.031
<i>All these people burning up
with their own personal pain...</i>

17:18.753 --> 17:21.637
<i>And then they inflicted it
upon their world.</i>

17:26.328 --> 17:31.538
<i>But all that time, I couldn't stop thinking
that the hatred that kills hearts</i>

17:31.638 --> 17:33.419
<i>and kills each other...</i>

17:33.519 --> 17:36.170
<i>it all really comes from within.</i>

17:42.027 --> 17:46.316
<i>The biggest lie that they told after 9/11
was that the enemy is out there.</i>

17:46.416 --> 17:50.921
<i>You know, somewhere in a desert,
in a cave, waiting to strike.</i>

17:51.471 --> 17:53.647
<i>But the darkest
and most frightening enemy...</i>

17:54.057 --> 17:57.050
<i>is the enemy
who poisons himself from within</i>

17:57.150 --> 18:00.461
<i>because he can't see the terror
inside his own heart.</i>

18:05.601 --> 18:06.929
Okay, thanks everyone.

18:07.029 --> 18:10.642
Now you've seen that, it's time
for the important part of tonight.

18:11.191 --> 18:16.419
Marcus has committed to say something,
so let's give him our full support.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.847
You alright?

18:29.124 --> 18:32.102
Before I came here, I was an addict.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.232
Before I got here...

18:35.882 --> 18:39.119
everyone blamed me for being in my pain.

18:39.399 --> 18:44.297
It was when I got off of it, that's
when I realized how... how bad...

18:45.974 --> 18:48.278
- Look, you have to do this.
- I know...

18:48.378 --> 18:50.746
- Okay?
- I know.

18:52.013 --> 18:54.216
I know!

18:56.752 --> 19:00.870
I know I've fucked up my chances before,
but I won't do it again.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.476
You've shown me so much...

19:04.668 --> 19:07.197
about the injuries
that have been given to me.

19:07.297 --> 19:11.311
And why I've been in so much pain
and how it caused me to be an addict.

19:11.768 --> 19:15.082
And I know that with your help,
and with Father's help,

19:15.182 --> 19:18.641
and with Grace's help,
that I can get there.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.924
Okay. Tell them.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.497
I want to let go of my life.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.916
I want to join you on the farm.

19:27.016 --> 19:29.519
It's so beautiful there and...

19:29.619 --> 19:34.558
I promise... that if you let me,
I will join your family.

19:35.958 --> 19:39.435
And I will protect you
like you've protected me.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.999
And I will light the light
of my consciousness.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.526
I will light my light.

20:01.783 --> 20:06.321
This is a photo of me, and my mum
and my stepdad Glen.

20:08.023 --> 20:11.500
It's the only thing I have of my old life.

20:27.843 --> 20:30.127
It burns!

20:37.452 --> 20:42.105
- That's all you had to do.
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.516
Something wrong, Travis?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.950
Not with me.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.373
You're the one making
the poor kid stand up here and...

20:57.473 --> 21:02.125
talk about some pretty difficult stuff
in front of a bunch of homeless people.

21:02.225 --> 21:04.227
No offense.

21:04.327 --> 21:06.215
- Is that what you see happening?
- Yeah, it is.

21:06.315 --> 21:08.681
'Cause, I see Marcus showing
a lot of courage and saying

21:08.781 --> 21:12.103
who he really wants to be and now
he's got somewhere where he belongs.

21:14.122 --> 21:16.567
You should be ashamed of yourself.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.600
Travis?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.303
Travis.

21:27.603 --> 21:31.388
- What?
- Don't stay away if you're in pain.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.439
Thanks.

21:57.182 --> 21:59.402
Come on. Do it.

21:59.802 --> 22:03.373
Do it. Just a little bit.
Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

22:03.473 --> 22:07.505
Not for them. Not for me. Just for you.

22:07.605 --> 22:10.345
Just for you. Come on, now.
Please, come on, please...

22:10.445 --> 22:14.175
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.521
- But you have to go inside.
- Okay. Yes. Inside.

22:18.621 --> 22:20.356
Just... here?

22:20.456 --> 22:23.159
- Shut the door. Shut the door.
- Shut the door? Door is shutting.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.775
- Thank you.
- No worries.

23:32.862 --> 23:34.945
Five...

23:38.967 --> 23:42.183
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, it's me.

23:43.405 --> 23:46.576
- It's Travis.
- <i>Travis, it's really late.</i>

23:46.676 --> 23:49.412
- Travis.
- <i>Okay.</i>

23:50.012 --> 23:53.783
Don't stay away if you're in pain...

23:53.883 --> 23:56.271
that's what she said.

23:56.486 --> 23:58.834
<i>What's happened, Travis?</i>

24:01.791 --> 24:06.128
- Pills, mostly.
- <i>Tell me, how many have you had?</i>

24:06.228 --> 24:08.531
Probably around forty.

24:08.631 --> 24:10.533
<i>Forty?</i>

24:10.633 --> 24:13.942
Maybe forty-seven.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.174
<i>Travis, where are you?</i>

24:18.274 --> 24:22.312
- <i>Tell me where you are.</i>
- I'm in my apartment.

24:23.112 --> 24:24.914
Where are you?

24:25.014 --> 24:28.150
- <i>What's your address?</i>
- Four seven three...

24:28.250 --> 24:29.952
- Four seven three king.
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

24:30.052 --> 24:36.262
- Just around the corner from the church.
- Travis? We're coming. Just stay awake!

25:06.921 --> 25:11.085
There you go... that's it, just a sip...

25:11.185 --> 25:15.292
One sip... that's it... that's it.

25:33.548 --> 25:36.608
How do you feel?

25:37.719 --> 25:41.265
It doesn't matter.

26:49.624 --> 26:51.474
Hello.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.272
Who are you?

26:59.300 --> 27:00.970
Where am I?

27:01.070 --> 27:03.488
Please don't. Where are you going?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.968
Hello?

27:18.920 --> 27:20.801
Hello?

27:29.597 --> 27:33.318
- I've got something for you to drink, mate.
- I don't want to drink it.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.661
- You've got to. You've gotta drink it.
- I don't want to fucking drink it.

27:35.761 --> 27:37.973
You stay the fuck away from me.
I don't want to fucking drink it.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.410
Listen to me you fucking assholes,
just stay the fuck away from me, okay?

27:41.510 --> 27:45.674
Stay the fuck away from me!
I don't want to drink it!

27:45.981 --> 27:50.286
Tom, what are you doing?
What's he doing? I don't want to drink it.

27:50.386 --> 27:52.755
Please, just leave me alone,
I just want to get out of here.

27:52.855 --> 27:56.418
I just want to get out of here!
You fucking prick!

27:56.518 --> 27:59.762
Oh, fuck! What are you doing!

27:59.862 --> 28:02.932
You motherfuckers!

28:03.032 --> 28:05.652
Why are you doing this?

28:06.051 --> 28:07.921
What the fuck are you doing!

28:10.739 --> 28:13.044
I don't want it!

28:13.847 --> 28:15.932
I don't want...

28:25.520 --> 28:29.988
I don't want to...
I don't want to drink it.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.442
I don't want to drink it.

28:33.542 --> 28:36.117
You motherfuckers.

28:36.217 --> 28:39.167
I don't want to drink it.

28:39.667 --> 28:42.805
I don't want to drink it.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.171
I don't want to drink it.

30:26.207 --> 30:28.117
Thank you.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.574
Your body's judging you
for your addiction.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.117
When you're a whole person
you can have a whole meal.

31:21.195 --> 31:22.765
Can't wait.

31:22.965 --> 31:25.482
That's just how it works.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.045
What are you looking for?

33:02.263 --> 33:04.334
Painkillers.

33:06.167 --> 33:08.070
Oxycozin.

33:08.370 --> 33:10.560
Cirtrulline. Diazepam.

33:11.673 --> 33:14.476
Vodka. Gin.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.662
You don't have a bottle of gin, do you?

33:18.780 --> 33:20.649
We don't have any of that here.

33:20.749 --> 33:24.767
Of course you don't,
because that would be fun.

33:50.344 --> 33:52.795
Why do you do them?

33:54.315 --> 33:55.685
Do what?

33:56.335 --> 33:58.350
The pills.

34:00.254 --> 34:03.192
I mean, do they make you feel good?

34:03.992 --> 34:05.795
No.

34:06.395 --> 34:08.914
They don't make you feel anything.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.011
It's brilliant.

34:12.766 --> 34:15.601
Is that what you were trying
to do when we found you?

34:17.005 --> 34:18.855
Yeah.

34:23.344 --> 34:25.956
My parents were just like you.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.467
But they couldn't get clear.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.339
What happened to them?

34:33.739 --> 34:35.609
Well, they had to leave.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.472
They left you here?

34:41.094 --> 34:43.916
Jay loves everyone who'll let him.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.869
Without him I'd be nothing.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.746
Okay.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.741
So what are you going to do now?

34:52.841 --> 34:56.245
- What do you mean?
- Well, do you want to fight it?

34:56.344 --> 34:58.199
Yeah.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.277
Do you?

35:01.750 --> 35:04.654
Yes. I want to fight it.

35:05.154 --> 35:07.867
Because if you don't,
you should just leave right now.

35:09.257 --> 35:11.987
I want to fight it.

35:12.926 --> 35:14.777
Okay.

35:36.817 --> 35:38.387
Jesus.

35:40.855 --> 35:43.233
Let's go for a walk.

35:55.436 --> 35:58.026
So you ever shot anything before?

35:59.039 --> 36:03.141
No. Guns aren't really my sort of thing.

36:03.778 --> 36:07.382
There was this one time
when I was guarding a checkpoint.

36:07.682 --> 36:10.495
And one of our guys he...
just didn't like the look of this bloke

36:10.595 --> 36:12.988
as he was coming towards us.

36:13.088 --> 36:17.126
So we all started yelling at him,
inzil, inzil, adyi faouk!"

36:17.226 --> 36:20.963
Just telling him to get down
on the ground, you know.

36:21.463 --> 36:23.632
So he takes off his shirt,

36:23.732 --> 36:27.336
and he shows us he's wearing
a vest with a bomb on it.

36:27.436 --> 36:30.639
And he's walking towards us with this...

36:30.739 --> 36:35.053
this stupid fucking grin on his face.

36:35.153 --> 36:38.847
And we're all screaming at him
and people are running everywhere,

36:38.947 --> 36:41.116
women, little kids.

36:41.216 --> 36:46.455
But this guy... man, this guy,
he was as cool as they come.

36:47.155 --> 36:49.391
My sergeant, he's there,
he's yelling at me,

36:49.491 --> 36:52.623
"take him down, take him down!"

36:53.295 --> 36:55.230
Problem was...

36:55.330 --> 36:58.133
I'd never actually shot anyone before.

36:58.233 --> 37:02.103
So obviously I was shitting myself,
I had the shakes, had the sweats,

37:02.203 --> 37:06.374
all the usual things you get when you've
been told to shoot a guy dead.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.836
Yeah.

37:07.936 --> 37:12.150
So they're still barking at me,
telling me to shoot this guy.

37:12.250 --> 37:17.174
And he's getting closer and closer
with this stupid fucking grin.

37:18.053 --> 37:20.565
So I'm lying there in the dirt...

37:20.665 --> 37:23.959
looking at this bloke
through the scope of my gun...

37:24.359 --> 37:26.665
and it suddenly dawns on me...

37:26.765 --> 37:30.916
that this guy... he actually wants to die.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.916
There you go.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.667
- Sorry.
- Nah, that's alright.

37:43.210 --> 37:45.163
What happened to him?

37:45.263 --> 37:48.141
Yep, I killed him.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.921
Through and through.

37:51.386 --> 37:53.969
Big fucking mess.

37:55.656 --> 37:59.803
But we found out later... he was crazy.

37:59.903 --> 38:03.565
He'd just lost his wife and his kid.

38:03.665 --> 38:06.163
Didn't have a bomb on him.

38:06.263 --> 38:08.810
Just wanted to get shot.

38:10.738 --> 38:12.568
Well...

38:14.136 --> 38:18.046
- What happened to you?
- Gave me a medal.

38:18.146 --> 38:20.625
I went to Thailand.

38:20.725 --> 38:22.884
Got hooked on smack.

38:22.984 --> 38:27.677
I fucked a lot. Forgot who I was
for about three years.

38:28.657 --> 38:31.147
And I came back here...

38:32.610 --> 38:34.813
I got clean...

38:35.363 --> 38:37.778
and I built this place.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.748
Anything else you want to know?

38:49.964 --> 38:52.614
This is the beginning of your healing.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.483
You understand?

38:54.783 --> 38:56.951
- Yes, Father.
- You?

38:57.051 --> 39:01.353
It's just... I'm so fucking exhausted
I can... What's the question again?

39:01.453 --> 39:04.125
You land on our doorstep
and expect us to rescue you,

39:04.225 --> 39:06.928
you have to be prepared
to go the whole journey.

39:07.028 --> 39:09.141
It's not enough for us
that you're not dead.

39:10.065 --> 39:13.612
There's a few very basic rules.
You eat what you're given.

39:13.712 --> 39:17.906
You do the drills without holding back and
you work with the others in the community.

39:18.006 --> 39:22.900
And you only talk about
what you feel to me or Tom.

39:23.311 --> 39:26.329
- That clear?
- Yes, Father.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.631
Yeah.

39:30.684 --> 39:33.100
Show us your strength.

39:35.132 --> 39:37.605
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Come on, you're weak.

39:37.705 --> 39:40.263
- Shut up, Marcus.
- Hit it, Travis.

39:40.463 --> 39:43.084
Listen, I think that this
is getting a bit out of hand.

39:43.184 --> 39:46.202
- Hit the bag!
- Just hit the bag, mate.

39:46.302 --> 39:48.587
- Just hit the bag?
- Just hit the bag.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.489
- Hit the bag.
- Hit the fucking bag.

39:51.589 --> 39:54.576
- Hit the fucking bag.
- Hit the bag! Just hit it!

39:54.676 --> 39:56.952
- Hit the bag!
- Hit it, Travis!

39:57.052 --> 39:59.381
- Hit the bag.
- Come on, mate.

40:03.283 --> 40:06.500
I can't do it. I'm not doing this.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.267
Go and get some rest, mate.

40:24.772 --> 40:27.075
I need something.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.944
I'm really sick.

40:29.444 --> 40:33.596
- Well, how about a run?
- That wasn't what I had in mind.

40:41.171 --> 40:43.258
To heal...

40:43.358 --> 40:45.127
all my injuries.

40:45.427 --> 40:47.619
To be safe.

40:48.019 --> 40:50.644
To feel safe with myself.

40:52.833 --> 40:56.485
To love... everyone. Equally.

40:59.107 --> 41:02.540
To find the joy in everything.
Even in pain.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.918
To be a protector of the community.

41:07.014 --> 41:08.917
To be powerful.

41:09.017 --> 41:12.798
So that nothing and no one
can harm our community.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.894
This is the purpose of my life.

41:16.491 --> 41:20.061
To touch people with music.
To show them the way out of their pain.

41:20.161 --> 41:22.024
Come on!

41:22.946 --> 41:25.363
To walk the red road in peace.

41:42.349 --> 41:44.651
- So what do you feel?
- I feel sick.

41:44.751 --> 41:47.322
That's because you're sick on the inside.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.357
That's what your body's showing you.

41:49.457 --> 41:54.262
You've been hiding behind your addiction
and you've been hurting yourself.

41:54.362 --> 41:58.066
But these feelings, it's just the advertising,
it's just the wrapping, yeah?

41:58.166 --> 42:02.237
I don't understand. I don't understand.
I don't understand what you're saying.

42:02.337 --> 42:05.294
- Do you get it?
- No, I don't get it.

42:06.356 --> 42:08.607
It's your soul.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.280
Do you get that?

42:11.880 --> 42:15.356
Hey, do you get it, do you fucking get it?

42:16.283 --> 42:19.135
- I think so.
- Then say it.

42:20.654 --> 42:24.527
- My soul...
- Your soul what?

42:25.393 --> 42:28.063
My soul is sick.

42:28.763 --> 42:31.887
My soul is in pain.

42:45.746 --> 42:47.949
See that's the tradeoff.

42:48.049 --> 42:51.592
Pain... for freedom.

43:02.896 --> 43:06.668
When I got back from Iraq,
I was a mess, man.

43:06.768 --> 43:08.903
I was a fucking mess.

43:09.003 --> 43:12.841
Thought I was gonna die soon,
so what's the point in living, yeah?

43:12.941 --> 43:17.846
Couldn't hold down a relationship.
Couldn't feel any emotions.

43:18.446 --> 43:21.794
And then one day, I had a good look around

43:21.894 --> 43:25.553
and I realized: Holy fucking shit!

43:25.653 --> 43:27.989
Everyone's doing the same thing.

43:28.089 --> 43:30.992
Everyone's terrified
of finding their own truth.

43:31.092 --> 43:34.129
And even more shit-scared
of doing anything about it.

43:34.229 --> 43:36.086
Yeah?

43:44.304 --> 43:47.048
Come on in, mate, it is fucking beautiful.

43:48.608 --> 43:50.532
Come on.

43:57.084 --> 43:59.130
So how do you feel?

44:01.121 --> 44:04.672
- I don't feel anything, really.
- Come on.

44:04.772 --> 44:07.509
Hey, you're alive, aren't you, man?

44:09.197 --> 44:11.533
You alive now? No?

44:11.633 --> 44:14.042
Okay, how about now?

44:14.142 --> 44:16.505
How about now? Now?

44:16.705 --> 44:18.440
- Come on
- What are you doing?

44:18.540 --> 44:22.586
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you fucking afraid of?

44:29.416 --> 44:32.251
What are you gonna fucking do about it?

44:32.653 --> 44:35.845
Come on, come on.

44:45.078 --> 44:49.103
There you go! Now is there anything
you want to say to me?

44:49.203 --> 44:52.921
- Stay the fuck way from me!
- Yes!

45:00.981 --> 45:03.218
Come on, Trav, wait up, mate.

45:03.318 --> 45:05.025
I don't want your fucking help, okay?

45:05.125 --> 45:08.404
Okay. You're free to go.
Take the old merc if you like,

45:08.504 --> 45:10.825
it's nothing flash but it'll get you
where you need to go.

45:10.925 --> 45:14.014
Grab the keys will you please, Tom?
There's a map in the glovebox,

45:14.114 --> 45:17.399
just let us know where you leave the car
when you get to town, okay, Travis?

45:17.799 --> 45:20.221
- Travis!
- What?

45:21.069 --> 45:24.978
- The cars are this way, mate.
- Fucking shit!

45:32.031 --> 45:35.387
- Fuck!
- Just give it a bit more choke.

46:36.927 --> 46:38.876
Wait here.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.666
Life crisis is spirit crisis, Trav.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.337
Your doctors...

47:02.437 --> 47:06.772
kept you away from that knowing
because they didn't want you looking in.

47:07.108 --> 47:10.960
You're still right in the guts
of your addiction, mate.

47:30.931 --> 47:33.847
I don't know who I am anymore.

47:35.119 --> 47:37.738
I don't know how to live.

47:37.838 --> 47:40.541
That's why Tom brought you here.

47:40.641 --> 47:44.658
Because right now there's nothing
holding you together.

47:45.379 --> 47:48.216
But if you can feel your pain,

47:48.316 --> 47:52.146
then you can feel your real self. Yeah?

47:55.222 --> 47:57.058
Ask me.

47:57.158 --> 47:59.808
- Ask you what?
- You know.

48:04.599 --> 48:07.246
- Help me.
- Mean it.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.068
- Help me.
- Mean it.

48:12.239 --> 48:14.525
Help me.

48:16.209 --> 48:18.429
Help me.

48:24.301 --> 48:26.522
Help me.

48:31.858 --> 48:33.941
Like this?

48:34.427 --> 48:36.597
Like this?

48:36.697 --> 48:38.766
Is this the game?

48:38.866 --> 48:42.470
- Is this the game? Hit the bag.
- There's the anger.

48:42.570 --> 48:45.793
- The anger? Fuck off!
- Chickenshit.

48:45.893 --> 48:49.110
I'm a chickenshit, am I?
I'm a chickenshit.

48:49.210 --> 48:52.831
Chickenshit, am I? Is that...
how's that for fucking chickenshit?

48:53.781 --> 48:55.849
Like that?

48:55.949 --> 48:58.066
Get it!

49:01.122 --> 49:03.952
Violin's your favorite isn't it, Trav?

49:10.664 --> 49:12.543
Is this what you want?

49:16.603 --> 49:18.352
Okay.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.876
Come on.

49:32.552 --> 49:34.569
Come on.

49:36.690 --> 49:38.392
Come on.

49:38.492 --> 49:40.628
- Come on, mate.
- Come on, mate.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.598
There's the anger, come on.
Kill the bag, Travis. Kill the bag.

49:43.698 --> 49:45.600
- Harder.
- Let it out mate, let it out.

49:45.700 --> 49:48.269
Travis, let yourself go, mate! Come on!

49:48.369 --> 49:52.337
- Come on, give it.
- Harder. Harder. Harder...

50:29.075 --> 50:30.561
Die!

50:46.126 --> 50:48.600
Who are you angry with?

51:02.709 --> 51:05.060
Who are you angry with?

51:07.691 --> 51:10.248
Who are you angry with?

51:19.943 --> 51:22.244
Who are you angry with?

51:29.536 --> 51:31.252
Hey.

51:32.605 --> 51:35.290
- Hey.
- What are you taking?

51:39.162 --> 51:43.922
Just things are... starting to get
on top of me a little bit here and...

51:44.652 --> 51:47.772
and it feels really heavy.
I come home and it feels really heavy

51:47.872 --> 51:51.926
and I just... I don't know
where to go and it just...

51:52.026 --> 51:55.297
It's all just fucking stacking
on top of each other, you know?

51:56.130 --> 51:57.912
Okay.

52:02.769 --> 52:04.610
Travis.

52:05.310 --> 52:08.636
- What?
- I just want to help you, Trav.

52:08.736 --> 52:11.879
- You just want to help me?
- Yeah.

52:11.979 --> 52:15.629
You... want to help me?

52:20.854 --> 52:22.707
Come on.

52:24.591 --> 52:26.598
Oh, my...

52:28.061 --> 52:31.867
Yeah, laugh, laugh,
you can't fucking talk, though.

52:34.367 --> 52:37.009
No, no, no. No. What the...

52:39.389 --> 52:41.632
Open the door!

52:42.942 --> 52:46.447
I know I'm fucked up
but at least I can feel!

52:46.847 --> 52:51.454
You're such a kid. You're such a kid
and you're scared, Travis!

52:51.714 --> 52:54.822
Fuck! Travis just look at me!

53:00.193 --> 53:02.539
Talk to me!

53:06.065 --> 53:08.002
You're fucked.

53:08.102 --> 53:10.782
Completely fucked.

53:15.809 --> 53:17.993
Who do you want to talk to?

53:19.746 --> 53:21.982
You're me.

53:22.082 --> 53:24.766
What do you want to say to yourself?

53:30.523 --> 53:33.398
For as long as I can remember...

53:34.762 --> 53:36.572
I've hated you.

53:39.033 --> 53:41.669
You've always had a special way of...

53:41.769 --> 53:44.285
fucking everything up.

53:45.339 --> 53:48.576
<i>Travis, it's me, again.</i>

53:49.250 --> 53:52.747
<i>You don't have to pick up.
I know you're listening, though.</i>

53:52.847 --> 53:54.849
<i>I hope you're listening.</i>

53:54.949 --> 53:56.129
Tell me.

53:57.017 --> 53:59.453
You were always pretending.

53:59.553 --> 54:02.172
You're a pretender.

54:02.272 --> 54:04.542
<i>Oh, God.</i>

54:04.642 --> 54:06.977
<i>I knew you were a frightened child.</i>

54:07.077 --> 54:09.430
<i>I knew it when I first met you.</i>

54:09.530 --> 54:11.899
<i>It was okay, 'cause I thought that...</i>

54:11.999 --> 54:14.468
<i>It doesn't matter what I thought now,</i>

54:14.568 --> 54:16.767
<i>really, does it?</i>

54:18.705 --> 54:21.552
<i>It's so beautiful up here.</i>

54:22.943 --> 54:25.660
<i>It's like the top of the world.</i>

54:28.882 --> 54:31.399
<i>I can see everything.</i>

55:08.956 --> 55:12.092
I've just been trying to run away.

55:12.192 --> 55:16.317
I've just been running
and running and running.

55:17.497 --> 55:21.619
- Look at me.
- I don't want to look at you.

55:21.719 --> 55:25.923
I'm so sick of looking at you.

55:26.373 --> 55:30.528
I just... you make me sick.

55:31.545 --> 55:36.102
And now somebody's dead because of you.

55:36.383 --> 55:39.652
Because of what you did.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.472
So what now?

55:46.292 --> 55:50.690
I just... I just want to get rid of you.

55:50.790 --> 55:54.335
I just... I don't want to be
filled with that hatred,

55:54.435 --> 55:57.189
all the time.

56:00.089 --> 56:02.560
And when I'm gone...

56:02.960 --> 56:05.009
what's left?

56:05.828 --> 56:08.245
I don't know.

56:12.569 --> 56:14.785
Just nothing.

56:15.572 --> 56:17.837
Just nothing.

56:20.710 --> 56:22.535
Good.

56:38.728 --> 56:40.577
Thank you.

56:41.297 --> 56:44.394
- Thank you.
- Welcome, brother.

56:44.635 --> 56:46.974
- Thank you.
- Welcome, Travis.

56:47.074 --> 56:50.221
- We love you, Travis.
- Welcome, Travis.

56:54.711 --> 56:56.806
Thank you.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.796
Thank you.

56:59.896 --> 57:02.093
Thank you.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.289
Okay.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.538
I'm really glad you're healing.

57:20.638 --> 57:22.519
Me too.

57:23.072 --> 57:25.809
It's important for who you can be.

57:25.909 --> 57:27.746
Yeah.

57:30.079 --> 57:32.515
And who you can be with.

58:19.061 --> 58:21.463
To be a soldier of peace.

58:22.199 --> 58:24.715
To stand by Jay's side.

58:25.935 --> 58:28.319
To live in love.

58:29.055 --> 58:30.895
This is the purpose for my life.

58:32.441 --> 58:35.056
To find the joy in everything.

58:35.356 --> 58:37.514
Even in pain.

58:37.614 --> 58:39.885
That is the purpose of my life.

58:41.585 --> 58:43.421
To touch people with music.

58:43.621 --> 58:47.298
To show them there's meaning
and take them out of their pain.

58:48.925 --> 58:50.815
To share myself.

58:51.761 --> 58:54.164
And only this.

58:54.264 --> 58:56.348
This is the purpose of my life.

58:59.302 --> 59:03.381
To forgive those who tarnished me.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.648
To forgive myself.

59:07.161 --> 59:10.483
This is the purpose my soul
has chosen for my life.

59:12.415 --> 59:15.986
I think that I always wanted
to heal people.

59:16.787 --> 59:20.071
And somewhere along the way,
I forgot that.

59:21.024 --> 59:25.388
But, yeah, I think...
that's the purpose of my life.

59:35.905 --> 59:39.076
- How's it look?
- Trust me.

59:39.976 --> 59:43.523
- It looks good.
- Okay.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:14.171
You need to be exposed to what he did
to you, and how you feel about it.

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:16.476
Do you understand?

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.539
You have to feel your pain.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.547
That's the grief of letting go.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:26.233
And then it won't affect you anymore.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:44.094
Now you're connected to your pain,
you can look out from yourself.

01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:48.776
And now you can be with that special someone
whose soul feels the same as yours.

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:51.088
Thank you, Jay.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.184
Hey.

01:03:42.284 --> 01:03:44.034
Hey.

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:48.826
- How you doing?
- Yeah.

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:52.896
You learn so much, right?

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:56.633
I mean, I'm only starting to see
how far away from myself I was.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:59.076
You've been working really hard too.

01:03:59.176 --> 01:04:01.972
I think we're at that point
where we're gonna start

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.678
breaking away from ourselves.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.412
- So you're feeling like you...
- it's like a calling, isn't it?

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.671
Once you start
you just gotta keep on going.

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:15.218
I've been so stupid.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:20.208
- I don't think that you're stupid...
- No. It's okay. I know.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:23.725
Trying to get people
in the city to like me...

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:29.195
You know, I was never gonna
be good at being that person.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:33.283
Neither were you. Right?

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:35.610
Right.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.525
I went swimming in the lake today.

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.486
And I took a long walk in the woods.

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:54.124
It's beautiful there.
This whole place is beautiful.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:57.027
You don't know how disconnected you are

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:59.810
until somebody shows you.

01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:04.211
Letting go of that person...

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.717
I'm excited.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.340
I'm really excited.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.291
I saw you and Jay in the woods.

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.861
No, you didn't.

01:05:26.405 --> 01:05:28.456
Marcus.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.673
Travis.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.485
I need to be by myself for a bit.

01:06:19.585 --> 01:06:22.024
You don't have to pretend.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.282
What do you mean?

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.563
I know you wanted me
to follow you down here.

01:06:58.947 --> 01:07:02.185
- Okay, just wait. Wait a minute.
- It's alright.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:04.287
It's not alright.

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.670
You're free now.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.040
We can be together.

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:15.305
We're like two drops out of the ocean.

01:07:18.133 --> 01:07:21.418
You need to stop talking like that.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.603
It's not right.

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:29.660
None of this is right.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:41.598
After everything we've done for you.

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.364
You haven't got the courage.

01:08:37.394 --> 01:08:40.049
Alright, thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.185
If I could have your attention, please.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:45.354
Tonight is a very special night,

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:50.674
as we celebrate Marcus's victory
after a long, hard-fought battle.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:06.736
Now Marcus has had to overcome
a lot of obstacles, a lot of demons.

01:09:06.836 --> 01:09:10.497
- Marcus...
- But with love, we can heal.

01:09:10.596 --> 01:09:13.020
- Can't we? Yeah
- Yeah.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.885
- It's one thing to sit there and say...
- It's time to go.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.020
...I feel pain.

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:20.523
But it's another thing entirely
to get off your butt

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:23.126
and do something about it, isn't it?

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:25.189
- You see, pain...
- This isn't right.

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:27.529
Yeah, it is. This is right.
This is where I belong.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.600
If you come with me
I can get you some help.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.828
Marcus is getting all the help he needs,
he was very courageous today.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.540
Is that what you were doing?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.845
You force him to have sex with you
and you call it... you call it helping?

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:45.113
- I didn't do that.
- I saw you.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.651
I didn't do that, Travis.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.953
Well, I want to hear it from Marcus.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:54.735
Marcus, did you want that?

01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:59.129
Yeah, I think you might be a little confused
as to what you saw today.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:02.776
Right, if I hadn't pushed Marcus into some
sort of action we would've lost him forever

01:10:02.876 --> 01:10:05.568
to his own fear,
and I won't apologize for that.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.771
I will never apologize for taking
drastic action to heal someone.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:13.661
You drag him here, he's got nobody,
nothing else and...

01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:17.280
And now that he depends on you,
you pull him apart.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.518
You see, therapists like Travis,
they call this transference.

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:26.063
Travis is putting his problems onto me
because he can't face them himself.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.785
You're still just a scared little boy,

01:10:28.885 --> 01:10:31.494
desperately seeking the attention
of his dad, aren't ya?

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:35.632
- This isn't about me.
- And now we're seeing the real you.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:40.280
See, you so badly want the love that you
can never have, but the bad news is...

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.673
You've got to have courage
to love, Travis.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:46.530
You're the one with the disorder, mate.

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:51.882
Marcus, this is supposed to be
a beautiful night for you.

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:56.319
- Do you feel good? Does it feel nice?
- Don't ruin this for me.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.822
You've got to get out of here!

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.251
How many of you know what's going on?

01:11:02.351 --> 01:11:04.395
- How many has it happened to?
- Excuse me,

01:11:04.495 --> 01:11:09.666
- is anyone else here feeling anger?
- Yeah, who's angry with this filthy liar?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.569
Hey, come on, be honest. Be honest.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:17.123
You see this is the classic example
of a sociopath.

01:11:17.223 --> 01:11:21.496
He's dead to himself,
so he'll use you instead.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:26.005
He'll say that he feels
exactly what you want him to feel,

01:11:26.105 --> 01:11:28.468
but it's all selfishness.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.236
He lies... doesn't feel a thing.

01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:38.414
Jay, did you really do that?

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.047
Marcus?

01:11:45.349 --> 01:11:48.204
- Marcus!
- Get this weak creature out of here.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.607
I don't know about you guys
but I can't stand to look at him anymore.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:53.810
Tom, how can you stand by?
How can you stand back here, man?

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.146
How can you stand back?
How can any of you let this happen?

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.863
How can any of you let it happen?

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:06.876
Travis is feeling a lot of jealousy
at the moment. A lot of pain.

01:12:06.976 --> 01:12:10.260
But tonight is not about Travis.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.943
- What are you doing... please!
- Tonight's about Marcus.

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.033
It's about his bravery.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:20.150
It's about his courage.
It's about his commitment.

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.612
You're a very brave man, Marcus,
look at me, mate.

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:32.048
You're a very, very, brave man.

01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:36.286
And we welcome you aboard
the farm community.

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:38.869
We all love you, mate.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.877
Well done, Marcus.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:17.408
- What the fuck is going on?
- You're leaving. Now.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.393
Come on.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.931
- Tom...
- Don't...

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.266
Don't say anything.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:34.644
- Brother, come on...
- You're not my brother anymore.

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.183
You don't exist.

01:13:57.465 --> 01:13:59.262
Tom!

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:04.991
Please?

01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:07.547
- Tom...
- Shut up.

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.333
Come on.

01:14:14.482 --> 01:14:17.740
Thank you. Thank you.

01:14:27.829 --> 01:14:29.922
Grace!

01:14:31.799 --> 01:14:35.018
- Grace!
- Oh, Jesus...

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.276
Tom, just keep driving!

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:42.979
- Put the gun down, Marcus.
- No.

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:45.081
- Come on!
- Start the car, Tom!

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:49.199
I'm ordering you to drop
the weapon, do it now!

01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:52.949
You lied to me.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.159
You lied to me!

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:58.661
You're not seeing things clearly, mate.

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:02.173
Your pain is making you lose your way.

01:15:02.273 --> 01:15:03.733
Is that what you really want?

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.602
Liar!

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.583
Marcus.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:10.373
- I love you, Marcus.
- No!

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:13.109
Jay! No!

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:14.711
No!

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:17.413
No... no!

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.596
No!

01:15:21.983 --> 01:15:23.727
- He's Al... he's alright.
- Marcus!

01:15:23.827 --> 01:15:26.254
- He's alright!
- Somebody help him!

01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:29.559
No, he's alright,
I said, stay the fuck away!

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:32.295
- Help him!
- No, I said he's okay!

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.831
Marcus. Marcus.

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:38.205
This isn't what you wanted, is it?

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.570
Let me hear you say it.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.972
Marcus, let me hear you say it,
this isn't what you wanted.

01:15:44.572 --> 01:15:46.912
This isn't what I wanted.

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:51.150
I know that. Marcus.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:54.168
I know that this is hard.
But it's gonna be okay.

01:15:54.268 --> 01:15:58.722
Marcus, look at me.
Marcus, it's gonna be okay.

01:15:59.522 --> 01:16:02.421
It's gonna be okay, let me hear you
say it. Let me hear you say it.

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:06.295
- It's gonna be okay.
- That's it Marcus, it's gonna be okay.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:10.133
It's gonna be okay. Marcus. Marcus.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.635
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.240
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.252
Marcus.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:23.550
Marcus? Listen to my voice, Marcus.

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:25.748
Look at me.

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.717
Marcus...

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.684
Give me the gun, Marcus.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.423
Marcus.

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:37.074
This... is me showing my pain.

01:16:37.174 --> 01:16:39.194
Marcus, no!

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.117
- Here... no, I can help him.
- Keep away from him!

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:04.267
I can help him, I can help him!

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.052
Don't move him, don't move him.
You don't want to move him.

01:17:11.152 --> 01:17:14.544
Tom, let me help him,
you don't want to move him!

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.981
Tom, just let me help him.

01:17:40.091 --> 01:17:42.700
- I can't stop the bleeding.
- Please, I'm a doctor if you just...

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.117
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- Toby if he can help...

01:17:45.217 --> 01:17:47.543
No! Don't let him.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.514
Travis, get down here.

01:18:01.809 --> 01:18:04.756
- Someone really needs to look at this.
- Could you do it.

01:18:04.856 --> 01:18:09.051
I can't. I don't have the equipment
and someone needs to look at this now.

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.306
- No.
- No.

01:18:10.406 --> 01:18:13.222
Please, Jay, just let us help you.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:17.398
I've seen what it's like
when you're near the end.

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.804
I'm not afraid of it.

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:25.160
The ones who ran...

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:28.038
they'll go straight to the police.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.174
That's alright.

01:18:31.574 --> 01:18:34.910
They'll have to live their days
knowing that they ran.

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.515
- If we tell the police what happened...
- No.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:41.317
You know what they'll do.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.970
They don't need an excuse.

01:18:45.771 --> 01:18:48.308
We've been betrayed.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:52.943
Travis's pain... has caused this.

01:18:55.563 --> 01:18:58.011
They'll be here soon.

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.717
With their anger...

01:19:00.817 --> 01:19:02.416
and their threats.

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.399
We'd better not be here when they come.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.178
We love you, Jay.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.040
- We love you, Jay.
- We love you, Jay.

01:19:18.586 --> 01:19:20.570
We love you, Jay.

01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:39.686
Tom, don't do this.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.205
No!

01:20:21.282 --> 01:20:23.049
Get out.

01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:26.903
Get out, come on. Now!

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.682
To be myself.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.635
To find truth.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.501
To be a mother.

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:41.865
I always wanted to be a mother.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.008
To fall in love.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:49.891
To be free. To be truly free.

01:20:55.266 --> 01:20:57.880
- Tom.
- Don't turn around.

01:20:59.237 --> 01:21:00.954
Stop.

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:13.178
I'm sorry.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:37.609
The road about three kilometers
that way, just go.

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:40.393
Tom, what's happening?

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.579
There's nothing left.

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:46.625
Just go.

01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:27.276
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:30.312
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:33.983
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:37.300
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:50.086
<i>I love you, Jay.</i>

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:52.655
<i>I fucking love you too, Andy.</i>

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:56.565
<i>See you on the other side, my brother.</i>

01:24:57.992 --> 01:25:00.396
<i>I love you too, Ben.</i>

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:03.413
<i>See you on the other side.</i>

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:10.032
<i>So much love.</i>

01:25:14.575 --> 01:25:17.189
<i>What would you like to say?</i>

01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:21.397
<i>Sorry, Jay.</i>

01:25:23.984 --> 01:25:26.611
<i>I couldn't do it. But...</i>

01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:29.822
<i>I'm going to make it up to you,
I will, I...</i>

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:34.760
<i>I'm ready to show them the agony
that I can see in their hearts.</i>

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:41.241
<i>In the land of the blind
the one eyed girl is queen.</i>

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:50.093
<i>I love you, Jay.</i>

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.892
Come on.

01:26:38.125 --> 01:26:40.763
<i>I want people to know
that you... you can be real.</i>

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:43.814
We really had something here.

01:26:44.264 --> 01:26:46.802
<i>We had it in the palm of our hand.</i>

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.162
<i>We live the right way.</i>

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:08.286
The way we're meant to live.
Just open your eyes, people.

01:27:08.386 --> 01:27:11.722
And everyone 'neath the vine
and fig tree shall live in peace...

01:27:43.991 --> 01:27:46.653
Drinking to you, Jay.

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.661
I love you, Jay.

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:16.472
<i>The train on platform
number seven goes to Creston...</i>

01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:25.367
<i>Please stand clear. Doors closing.</i>

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:32.520
<i>Attention passengers. This train
is an express train to... Creston.</i>

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:36.691
<i>This train's first stop will be Creston.</i>

01:29:12.913 --> 01:29:17.500
Excuse me. Would you like to ask
a question with me, ma'am?

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.156
How about you, sir, would you like
to ask a question with me?

01:29:27.588 --> 01:29:29.631
Everybody...

01:29:29.851 --> 01:29:34.309
Look, I know you've been ignoring me,
but today's a really special day.

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:38.206
Today you're going to learn about
the kind of life you've led and...

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:41.391
and the impact that life
has had on other people.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:46.736
Today you're going to learn
the purpose of your life.

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:49.718
To not listen to any more
street preacher bullshit?

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:54.203
I reckon that's the purpose of my life.
Thanks for sharing.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.573
I believe that our ignorance and our
blindness have made this world unlivable.

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:12.188
- Jesus!
- She's got a gun.

01:30:21.615 --> 01:30:25.546
Jay taught us to see the pain
of the injuries inside us.

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:30.569
And he taught us to see
the enemies within us.

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:35.645
He was made to kill people
in a false and unjust war and...

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:37.893
damaged him deeply but...

01:30:37.993 --> 01:30:41.678
he returned home to make a world
of peace for everyone and...

01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:44.156
he believed that our pain
is within ourselves and...

01:30:44.256 --> 01:30:47.991
that we need to release that pain
to give ourselves the gift...

01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:51.027
to give ourselves the gift of freedom.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:54.316
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

01:30:54.416 --> 01:30:57.520
- I said, can you understand that?
- Yes.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:07.826
Okay, I'm going to give you
all a brochure and...

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:09.765
and...

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:13.480
and you'll notice that on the inside
there are some lyrics to a song.

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:18.640
Sorry if I don't have enough for everyone.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:22.081
If you don't get one you can
just look on with your neighbor.

01:31:23.894 --> 01:31:26.732
One... two... three.

01:31:26.882 --> 01:31:31.553
<i>And everyone neath
their vine and fig tree...</i>

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:33.287
Stop!

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.692
You need to do it louder.

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:38.327
Okay?

01:31:38.627 --> 01:31:43.493
<i>And everyone neath their vine and fig tree</i>

01:31:43.593 --> 01:31:48.203
<i>Shall live in peace and unafraid.</i>

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:53.075
<i>And everyone neath their vine and fig tree</i>

01:31:53.475 --> 01:31:57.759
<i>Shall live in peace and unafraid</i>

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:07.022
<i>And into ploughshares turn their swords</i>

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:12.083
<i>Nations shall learn war no more</i>

01:32:12.183 --> 01:32:16.982
<i>And into ploughshares turn their swords...</i>

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.861
<i>Attention passengers.</i>

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.048
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

01:32:32.611 --> 01:32:35.233
- It's okay.
- <i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:38.320
- What are you doing?
- I was looking for you.

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:41.818
Jay's gone.

01:32:41.918 --> 01:32:44.738
I know. I'm sorry.

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:49.564
- I need to make them understand.
- We do, don't we? Just keep the gun on me.

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:52.267
Everyone listen to what Grace
is telling you.

01:32:52.367 --> 01:32:55.645
She's giving you a chance
to learn the truth.

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.875
Is that right, Grace?
Is that what we're doing?

01:32:59.975 --> 01:33:01.743
Stop!

01:33:01.843 --> 01:33:04.329
Just stop lying!

01:33:04.429 --> 01:33:06.665
You don't believe in anything.

01:33:06.815 --> 01:33:11.254
Jay died trying to save you
and every single person in this world.

01:33:12.454 --> 01:33:15.357
- He loved too much.
- No, he didn't.

01:33:15.457 --> 01:33:17.759
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

01:33:17.859 --> 01:33:21.495
I wasn't strong enough.
I'm not strong enough.

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:27.342
Do you remember meeting me on this train?

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.978
I'd be dead if it wasn't for you.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.110
I was in so much pain, Grace.

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:39.216
I did something wrong,
I did something really wrong.

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:43.084
I caused so much damage.

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.487
And I was so scared.

01:33:45.587 --> 01:33:47.122
Just like you are.

01:33:47.222 --> 01:33:49.776
I didn't want to live anymore.

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:54.730
But you never gave up on me, did you?

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:57.129
Everyone's gone.

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:01.569
Tom. Marcus, my mum.

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:04.439
I know, but they're not brave like you.

01:34:04.539 --> 01:34:06.795
I just want to be with the others now.

01:34:07.125 --> 01:34:10.028
- You want to be with them.
- Yeah.

01:34:10.128 --> 01:34:12.648
You want to be with them?

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:16.764
Okay. Okay, well, let's do it.
Let's do it.

01:34:16.864 --> 01:34:20.288
Shoot me and then shoot yourself
but I think that you should do it quickly

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.976
because you are really
scaring these people.

01:34:25.522 --> 01:34:26.597
Do it.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.255
You were right.

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:40.242
We're like two drops out of the ocean
and I'm really glad I met you.

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.044
So do it.

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.642
Shoot me.

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:47.713
Do it!

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:56.867
I don't want to.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.670
I don't want to be like them.

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:12.161
You're not.
You're not like anyone I've ever met.

01:35:17.644 --> 01:35:19.753
It's okay.

01:35:20.531 --> 01:35:22.701
It's okay.

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:25.717
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:33.115
We just have to keep being brave. Okay?

01:35:33.215 --> 01:35:35.044
We just keep being brave.

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:40.635
I'm sorry.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.532
I think you should tell them that.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.252
I'm sorry.

01:36:05.008 --> 01:36:06.921
We're really sorry, everyone.

01:36:07.896 --> 01:36:10.305
We'll just wait now
for the police to come.

01:36:19.656 --> 01:36:21.732
There's no bullets in the gun.

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:25.180
Everyone's going to be okay.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.988
Everything's going to be okay.

01:36:55.909 --> 01:36:58.834
<i>For as long as I can remember,</i>

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.460
<i>I've hated you.</i>

01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:04.385
<i>You've always had a special way...</i>

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:07.056
<i>of fucking everything up.</i>

01:37:07.956 --> 01:37:10.706
<i>It's so beautiful up here.</i>

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:14.740
<i>It's like the top of the world.</i>

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:18.249
<i>I can see everything.</i>

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:23.250
<i>You're always pretending.</i>

01:37:24.439 --> 01:37:26.919
<i>You're a pretender.</i>

01:37:36.233 --> 01:37:38.934
<i>Pretending to care.</i>

01:37:40.304 --> 01:37:43.711
<i>Pretending to be a good person.</i>

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:59.573
<i>But when it really comes down to it...</i>

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:05.401
<i>You're just a frightened child.</i>

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:15.122
<i>It's so beautiful up here.</i>

01:38:15.822 --> 01:38:18.460
<i>It's like the top of the world.</i>

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.443
<i>I can see everything.</i>

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:27.036
<i>I guess that's it.</i>

01:38:28.136 --> 01:38:30.918
<i>You're really not coming, are you?</i>

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:19.302
It just feels like a bad dream.

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:24.192
And every morning on the farm we'd wake up

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:28.288
and we'd tell each other how much
we loved our world and everyone in it.

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:32.621
And we were loved.

01:39:36.069 --> 01:39:39.732
But they all left and...

01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:44.012
I didn't want to stay
but I didn't know what to do.

01:39:44.112 --> 01:39:46.896
And you chose not to go with the others?

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:54.373
I know one person can do something
so brave that they can fix their soul.

01:39:57.557 --> 01:40:00.102
Otherwise what's the point?

01:40:09.853 --> 01:40:12.141
Can I go now?

01:40:13.305 --> 01:40:19.697
