00:02.003 --> 00:04.204
We been sitting on this bench forever.

00:04.239 --> 00:06.909
After the game, I'ma be
spread-eagle in the tub,

00:06.944 --> 00:08.842
soaking my cheeks
in some Epsom salts.

00:08.877 --> 00:12.047
Shit, we finna go to the mall
on a coochie safari

00:12.082 --> 00:14.314
- and get up on some numbers.
- All you gon' do is watch me hunt.

00:14.349 --> 00:17.079
If you lucky, I'll let you
scavenge on my leftovers.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.151
Man, how come you always claimin'
you more league than us?

00:20.155 --> 00:23.164
Who almost beat Cheryl Miller Jr.
in a game of Clydesdale?

00:23.199 --> 00:23.958
Me.
So fall back.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.489
Hold up. Hold up.
Massa comin'.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.003

00:35.003 --> 00:38.071
Hey, fellas, good job.
I was checking you out the whole game.

00:38.073 --> 00:41.138
Aye, slow your roll, homey.
We ain't with that Chris Bosh shit.

00:41.143 --> 00:43.243
No, no, no, it's not like that.

00:43.245 --> 00:45.709
- You ever heard of ML Carr?
- Oh, is that that new Benz?

00:45.714 --> 00:48.384
No, no, I'm talking
about the basketball player.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.683
Two-time world champion
Boston Celtic,

00:50.686 --> 00:53.421
played with Larry Bird, Dennis Johnson,
and Kevin McHale?

00:53.422 --> 00:56.862
<i>- Wow!

But it sound kinda boo-boo.

01:06.969 --> 01:09.648
Well, you aren't invited anyway.
These two are.

01:12.548 --> 01:14.568
Ohh, shit! Who's league

01:19.614 --> 01:21.414

It's obvious this place is
only for well-trained athletes.

02:48.804 --> 02:53.142

- I'ma suck on more of these balls.

02:53.341 --> 02:57.041

Now get in there and make

<i> I'd quit my job at Best Buy,

04:16.959 --> 04:18.791

a Puerto Rican cock.

Wait, you already qualified

04:35.563 --> 04:38.383
Can DJ Khaled go on a diet
and still gain weight?

04:38.418 --> 04:40.675
- Them five stacks is mine.
- Not if I can help it.

04:40.682 --> 04:42.316
I'm tired of living in your shadow.

04:42.351 --> 04:44.921

that contact high,

04:44.956 --> 04:45.953

04:45.988 --> 04:48.418
You gon' always be in my shadow.
Now kick rocks!

04:48.423 --> 04:51.063
This couch is for qualified
"Hoop or Die-ers" only.

04:51.098 --> 04:53.089
That's all right, Andre Negro Dolla.

04:53.095 --> 04:56.196
When I win, I won't need a couch,
'cause I'ma sit on yo' face.

04:56.231 --> 04:59.171
You sit on my face,
and I'ma eat your ass alive.

04:59.206 --> 05:00.497
- Wait. What?
- Wait a minute. What?

05:00.202 --> 05:03.972
Yo, our Adderall sales
are through the roof today!

05:04.007 --> 05:05.272
Is it SAT season already?

05:05.273 --> 05:07.773
Naw, it's the "Hoop or Die"
Tournament, my man.

05:07.776 --> 05:09.836
It's the March Madness
of video games.

05:09.845 --> 05:11.135
See, this is what I'm talking about.

05:11.146 --> 05:12.806
We should be marching
about the madness,

05:12.814 --> 05:14.781
but the madness has us
playing "Madden"

05:14.816 --> 05:16.749
and marchin'
about being mad but...

05:16.752 --> 05:18.469
Man, you know
what I'm talkin' about.

05:18.504 --> 05:21.218
- I'm confused and stuff, ese.
- Look, all I'm sayin' is,

05:21.223 --> 05:23.457
the boost in Adderall sales
is just the tip of the iceberg.

05:23.492 --> 05:25.691
This is an opportunity to crack
these crackers over the head

05:25.694 --> 05:27.794
and game these gamers
out of their gaming money.

05:27.796 --> 05:30.256
- Now, that's game, homes.
- Two for $40.

05:30.265 --> 05:31.395
I mean $60.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.770
Damn, you giving me
the tourist prices, player?

05:33.805 --> 05:35.302
Surge pricing, like Guber.

05:35.337 --> 05:38.337
Look, player, you buy or you go!

05:40.374 --> 05:43.744
Hold up. Slow your roll.
I gotta check you first.

05:43.745 --> 05:45.075
LaDante?
What are you doing here?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.910
My side hustle, fool.
Now spread them legs.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.976
I wanna make sure
you're not packin'.

05:49.985 --> 05:52.585
That's good right there.
That's all you?

05:52.587 --> 05:53.447
Mm.
You need to wax.

05:53.455 --> 05:55.955
I got a Brazilian that can
take care of that for you.

05:55.957 --> 05:57.787
Empty you out at the end too.

05:57.793 --> 05:59.712
Damn, Jared.
Get off my footlong.

05:59.747 --> 06:01.631
- You mean six-inch.
- Whoa, whoa!

06:01.666 --> 06:02.830
I'm just here to qualify.

06:02.831 --> 06:06.131
Next.
Step up. Bring that ass.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.843
It's a long bench ride
for those ass muscles.

06:08.878 --> 06:10.267
God forbid
there's a triple overtime.

06:10.272 --> 06:12.772
So to keep them cheeks loose
and from falling asleep,

06:12.774 --> 06:14.374
you're gonna have to stretch 'em.

06:14.409 --> 06:17.209
- Stretch your what?
- Gluteus maximus.

06:17.212 --> 06:18.679
Hold up.
That's that Roman white boy

06:18.680 --> 06:21.381
- with mad squabbles, right?
- No, no, no. This is serious.

06:21.383 --> 06:22.582
In addition to being
the new pussy,

06:22.617 --> 06:24.977
the ass is the most important
muscle to stretch

06:24.986 --> 06:26.817
when riding the bench.
Let me tell you a little story.

06:26.822 --> 06:29.662
I was there when benchwarmer
and noted philanthropist

06:29.697 --> 06:31.458
Donny LarMue
picked up a wet penny

06:31.460 --> 06:34.090
in his Jordache jeans
using only his ass.

06:34.096 --> 06:35.956
And you know
why he was able to do that?

06:35.964 --> 06:37.164
Huh?
Do you know why, huh?

06:37.165 --> 06:38.155
Do you know?
Do you know?

06:38.166 --> 06:40.055
Because he stretched his
[bleep]ing glutes.

06:40.090 --> 06:42.404
Now grab your butt cheeks.
I said grab 'em!

06:42.439 --> 06:44.989
Squeeze and move
and squeeze and move.

06:45.024 --> 06:47.540
And squeeze and move
and squeeze and move.

06:47.542 --> 06:48.372
I don't hear you!

06:48.376 --> 06:51.106
Squeeze and move
and squeeze and move.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.213
Dis nigga.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.352
Come on, Grove, get it together.
You can't lose to Benny Hana.

06:59.387 --> 07:02.587
Triangle, triangle, square,
then double-tap circle.

07:05.292 --> 07:09.332
Yeah, now what's up?
Now who wanna fade Grover?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.401
<i> Cook that nigga!</i>

07:19.673 --> 07:21.243
Oh, hell yeah!

07:26.615 --> 07:28.245
Damn, LaDante, you got skills!

07:28.250 --> 07:30.020
You think you can give me
some more tips?

07:30.055 --> 07:31.478
Why the hell should I help you?

07:31.486 --> 07:32.916
I'm just trying to prove to Montrel

07:32.921 --> 07:35.261
that I'm just as much
of a man as he is.

07:35.296 --> 07:36.617
You need to prove you a man?

07:36.625 --> 07:39.755
I can help you
with your manhood.

07:40.295 --> 07:44.055
Mmm, herbal essences.
Yeah, I got yo' tip.

07:44.065 --> 07:45.965
Meet me at my house tonight.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.997
And wear something really cute.

07:49.004 --> 07:51.374
Damn, you smell good.

07:53.145 --> 07:55.788
Hey, LaDante, um,
this hand massage feels cool,

07:55.795 --> 07:57.355
but what's it got to do
with the tournament?

07:57.363 --> 08:00.603
First rule of training
is shut the [bleep] up.

08:00.638 --> 08:01.633
Your hands loose?

08:01.668 --> 08:03.728
Yeah, my G.
They actually feel relaxed.

08:03.736 --> 08:06.366
- Now let's work on that ass.
- What?

08:06.372 --> 08:09.942
A little prison joke.
Always kills on the yard.

08:10.778 --> 08:13.263
What's this for?

08:13.298 --> 08:15.748
Our first training session.

08:15.783 --> 08:16.248
Ugh.

08:16.249 --> 08:19.151
This is called "Wash the Draws."
Now get to it.

08:19.152 --> 08:21.834
How'd you get so good
at "Hoop or Die" anyway?

08:21.869 --> 08:24.517
My cellmate Clark
was a beast on them sticks.

08:24.524 --> 08:26.024
He was nice with them fingers.

08:26.059 --> 08:28.559
He could push
all the right buttons.

08:28.561 --> 08:30.861
He was good at video games too.

08:30.863 --> 08:32.964
Uh, LaDante, look, man,
I'm scrubbing,

08:32.999 --> 08:34.929
but I think whatever you spilled
is in the fabric.

08:34.933 --> 08:37.703
Keep scrubbin', nigga,
if you want to win.

08:37.738 --> 08:40.472
Me and Clark about to go play
"Call of Booty."

08:41.674 --> 08:44.784
You see, this is one
of the most important skills

08:44.819 --> 08:46.877
that you're gonna learn
at this camp:

08:46.879 --> 08:49.768
- the art of towel waving.
- It's just waving a towel.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.182
"Just waving a towel"
saved my grandfather's career.

08:52.185 --> 08:54.285
<i>Man, this is lame and a shame.</i>

08:54.287 --> 08:56.287
<i>We getting our tuchus kicked, Jack.</i>

08:56.289 --> 08:57.489
You need to stop jiving.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.460
We need to encourage
these youngbloods

08:59.495 --> 09:01.926
and raise their spirits.
We need to get Mr. Bird flyin'.

09:01.928 --> 09:05.298
Man, ain't nothing we can do
from this here bench.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.828
Shit, hand me that towel.

09:06.833 --> 09:10.867
I'm 'bout to get these white folks
to give us some energy, baby.

09:14.806 --> 09:17.976
<i>Wow. I've never witnessed
anything like this.</i>

09:17.977 --> 09:22.409
<i> The crowd has come alive
and willed this team into a victory!</i>

09:22.415 --> 09:27.645
<i> The MVP of this game
is the towel!</i>

09:27.653 --> 09:29.723
My grandfather
was on the verge of retiring

09:29.758 --> 09:31.792
when he pioneered
this very towel wave

09:31.827 --> 09:32.623
that gets white folks hyped.

09:32.658 --> 09:34.458
This move, this move here,
huh, this move right here,

09:34.460 --> 09:37.360
it got him six additional
years in the league,

09:37.363 --> 09:39.397
and it kept us...
and it kept us...

09:39.432 --> 09:40.332
it kept us out of public...

09:40.333 --> 09:44.103
public school, public housing,
public transportation...

09:44.138 --> 09:45.943
Sorry.

09:46.872 --> 09:47.472
Towels up!

09:47.507 --> 09:51.037
Now twist it around your hand
and spin it like a helicopter!

09:51.044 --> 09:52.143
Spin it.
Spin it.

09:52.178 --> 09:53.578
That's right.
Spin it!

Give it up for two legends

You right.
These scrubs are liquid dookie.

10:43.996 --> 10:46.356
Okay, guys, let's start
with some questions.

10:46.365 --> 10:47.465
Yes, fat kid.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.027
What was the highlight
of your career

10:49.035 --> 10:50.465
that we never knew you had?

10:50.470 --> 10:52.200
Good question.
Glad you asked.

10:52.205 --> 10:54.235
Stealing the moment

10:59.345 --> 11:02.275
Man, this corny-ass cracker
ain't got no rhythms.

11:02.281 --> 11:03.314
Oh, yeah.
Me, me, me, me!

11:03.349 --> 11:06.179
Do you guys eat at, like,
the finest restaurants,

11:06.185 --> 11:08.516
- like, every night?
- Ooh, that's such a good question.

11:08.521 --> 11:10.891
Shit, my Gs,
I usually eat at the crib,

11:10.926 --> 11:12.023
unless I'm trying to get it in.

11:12.058 --> 11:14.388
Then I'll take a chicken
to Houston's.

11:15.261 --> 11:17.501
I know y'all scrubs and all.
No offense.

11:17.536 --> 11:18.897
But do y'all get any groupie love?

11:18.898 --> 11:21.228
And if so,
do they let y'all go raw?

11:21.234 --> 11:23.068
Great question.
You know, we don't come up

11:23.069 --> 11:26.795
on floor-seat breezys like
we'd like.

11:26.806 --> 11:29.766
But we do be soaki''
in them cheap-seat chickens.

11:30.576 --> 11:33.106
Word, Mark, the groupie hos
generally want the starters.

11:33.112 --> 11:34.634
And with the invention of Google,

11:34.669 --> 11:36.677
these greedy-ass tricks
can now check your contracts.

11:36.682 --> 11:38.783
Shit, the game's [bleep]ed up
now, guys.

11:38.818 --> 11:42.448

11:42.455 --> 11:43.515

It's the fourth anniversary of the
day my life partner got locked up.

12:12.385 --> 12:16.224
How do you lock up a face
like this? How do you?!

12:16.259 --> 12:18.315
I know you walking down
memory lane and all that,

12:18.324 --> 12:21.730
- but the tournament is tomorrow.
- Clark!

12:21.765 --> 12:24.362
- Clark could cook!
- Hey, uh, big man,

12:24.397 --> 12:26.797
I need a last-second
training session, though.

12:26.799 --> 12:29.403
- How do I block missiles if I'm...
- You talkin' about a game.

12:29.404 --> 12:30.973

12:38.610 --> 12:42.280
Clark!

12:43.416 --> 12:46.546
Thanks for gathering
on such short notice.

12:46.552 --> 12:47.385
Check this out, y'all.

12:47.420 --> 12:50.745
- These camp counselors think we suck.
- Well, we do.

12:51.724 --> 12:54.534
I don't know about y'all,
but I started playing basketball

12:54.569 --> 12:57.287
to get a bunch
of big brown booties pregnant.

12:58.564 --> 13:01.034
We can't get no groupies
pregnant from the bench.

13:01.069 --> 13:03.703
That's right.
So you know what I say?

13:03.738 --> 13:06.571
- I say we hoops!
- We hoops!

13:06.572 --> 13:07.205
<i>We hoops!</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:10.610
<i>We hoops!
We hoops! We hoops!</i>

13:10.645 --> 13:13.180
Yo, Elbows, go to work, homey.

13:20.386 --> 13:23.130
Like I said, we hoops.

13:52.269 --> 13:55.669
Game! What?
Told y'all, busters.

13:57.373 --> 13:59.326
Great game, dudes.
That was intense.

13:59.361 --> 14:01.279
There's a reason
why you ass-clowns

14:01.314 --> 14:02.578
are at a benchwarmers' camp.

14:02.579 --> 14:05.079
Now, whose bright idea was this?

14:05.082 --> 14:08.646
- Fine, all of you sit down.
- Naw, homey, we ain't sittin'.

14:08.652 --> 14:10.052
- I said sit!
- Hell no!

14:10.053 --> 14:12.487
We'd rather die on our feet
than live on our cheeks.

14:12.522 --> 14:15.822
None of us are sitting, Coach.
We're never sitting again.

14:15.826 --> 14:18.193
- Ain't nobody say all that.
- Fine, you [bleep]ing losers.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.997
But just know,
you ain't gettin' no refund.

14:21.032 --> 14:23.767
I already cashed them checks,
biatches!

14:23.802 --> 14:26.427
The only way we beat the house
is to find someone

14:26.436 --> 14:28.496
who's undervalued
and overcome the odds.

14:28.505 --> 14:29.935
Who's the least likely
to win, homes?

14:29.940 --> 14:33.380
This guy who hates cats.
His name is No Pussy Nippsy.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.037
Oh, no, it's not about the cats.

14:35.045 --> 14:37.975
It means he never stuck
his thingy in a girl before.

14:37.981 --> 14:40.551
Ugh, why would anyone
ever want to do that?

14:40.586 --> 14:42.215
Who knows?
But I ran the numbers,

14:42.219 --> 14:44.769
and none of the last three
champions ever got any pussy.

14:44.804 --> 14:46.955
- Check the graph.
- That's how we're gonna get paid.

14:46.990 --> 14:50.160
We puttin' all our money
on No Pussy Nippsy.

14:54.498 --> 14:58.628
<i> Will player Grover please
report to your game station?</i>

14:58.635 --> 15:00.335
<i> Grover.
Player Grover.</i>

15:00.337 --> 15:03.905
- What the hell is yo' problem?
- Your training was some bullshit.

15:03.940 --> 15:06.540
All I did was pop blackheads
and wash dirty draws.

15:06.543 --> 15:08.783
How is that gonna help me
win the tournament?

15:08.818 --> 15:09.979
Man, I might as well give up.

15:09.980 --> 15:13.480
Give up?
You France now, le negro?

15:13.483 --> 15:15.877
- No, I just...
- Then show me "Wash the Draws."

15:15.886 --> 15:18.286
- Huh?
- "Wash the Draws"!

15:18.288 --> 15:20.418
Concentrate, Clark...
I mean Grover.

15:20.424 --> 15:23.934
You play with your hands,
but you win with your head.

15:23.969 --> 15:26.387
Understand?

15:26.396 --> 15:29.700
Better.
Now show me "Pop the Pimple."

15:29.735 --> 15:31.000
Focus!

15:32.268 --> 15:35.298
Now put all the techniques
together.

15:41.778 --> 15:43.908
Now you ready.

16:30.727 --> 16:34.857
Guess who got paroled,
you big ole homo.

16:34.865 --> 16:39.573
- I'm finally home.
- Clark? Clark, is that you?

16:40.470 --> 16:42.003
Hey, where are you going
with my trainer?

16:42.038 --> 16:45.468
Don't let this sweet
Justin Bieber face fool you.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.075
I will cut a mother[bleep]er.

16:47.077 --> 16:48.977
Clark, where are we going,
boo-boo?

16:48.979 --> 16:52.149
<i>We're going home, baby.
We're going home.</i>

16:52.184 --> 16:54.919
Malik, we got a big problem,
my man.

16:54.954 --> 16:56.278
No Pussy just got pussy,
homes.

16:56.286 --> 16:59.016
We bet everything on him.
That means we both got screwed.

16:59.022 --> 17:00.822
It's like y'all don't know
who Malik is.

17:00.857 --> 17:04.587
This is AP Hustle 101.
There's always a contingency.

17:04.594 --> 17:08.034
Hey, Montrel,
let me holler at you real quick.

17:08.497 --> 17:11.926
I'm glad they kicked us out.
I'm ready to go home anyways.

17:11.935 --> 17:14.998
This ain't no place for a real nig.

17:15.005 --> 17:16.535
Grover's right.
That do feel good.

17:16.540 --> 17:20.214
Now say it again
and emphasize the E-R.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.506
Who I look like,
Boo Boo the foo', my nig?

17:23.512 --> 17:26.253
You don't deserve this.
You guys really disappointed me.

17:26.289 --> 17:28.784
The feeling is mutual.
I mean, who disables

17:28.785 --> 17:30.945
the soft-serve machine
in the cafeteria?

17:30.954 --> 17:33.294
We ain't always finna be
benchwarmers.

17:33.329 --> 17:34.322
I gots real potentials.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.187
Uh, no, you don't.
Four minutes a game, at best.

17:37.194 --> 17:38.126
You're a privileged wannabe.

17:38.161 --> 17:40.645
You'll end up managing
a bad rap group or, worse,

17:40.680 --> 17:43.130
writing for a black TV show
on Comedy Central,

17:43.133 --> 17:45.327
- [bleep]ing losers.
- Eat a black [bleep]!

17:45.335 --> 17:46.665
Here go one right here.

17:46.670 --> 17:49.768
Yeah, nigga, that's right,
we took all y'all Oriental shit.

17:49.773 --> 17:52.192
We got Bruce Lee,
Kimora Lee, Sara Lee,

17:52.227 --> 17:55.431
and now we 'bout
to take y'all video games.

17:55.466 --> 17:57.251
You know, you talkin' a lot
of trash to be rolling dolo.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.847
Man, ain't nobody worried
about being dolo,

17:59.850 --> 18:03.115
you wide-faced bitch.
Ow! Oh!

18:03.119 --> 18:05.049
I think I pulled
all my ass muscles!

18:05.055 --> 18:06.915
Come on, 'Trel,
stop messin' around.

18:06.923 --> 18:08.923
This is my shot
at finally beating you

18:08.925 --> 18:09.755
and getting your respect.

18:09.759 --> 18:13.859
Sorry, lil bro-bro.
Looks like we both assed out.

18:15.558 --> 18:17.351
Don't worry, 'Trel.
Just rest up.

18:17.386 --> 18:18.888
I'm finna represent
for the family.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.959
Man, don't sweat that, Grove.
I faked that shit.

18:21.994 --> 18:24.093
- What?
- Man, Malik needed me to throw

18:24.094 --> 18:27.096
- my next match, so, you know...
- And the Image Award goes to...

18:27.098 --> 18:30.028
Aye, I told you I wanted these
in singles, nigga, damn!

18:30.034 --> 18:32.134
But if you won,
you was gonna be playing me.

18:32.136 --> 18:35.304
Why I'ma play when I can get paid?
That's idiot.

18:35.339 --> 18:36.839
Damn, you the worst
big brother in the world.

18:36.841 --> 18:40.811
Now, when I called you a bitch
earlier, it was simply an idiom.

18:40.846 --> 18:42.645
But, cuz, you really is a bitch.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.220
Man, you know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.017
Now, hold up, Grove.

18:47.018 --> 18:49.148
We all know there's no way
you could ever

18:49.153 --> 18:51.153
in your life
whup my ass in anything.

18:51.188 --> 18:55.158
But I can help you whup
this other bitch, though.

19:03.266 --> 19:05.935
All right, little bro,
now, if you gon' beat this bitch,

19:05.970 --> 19:07.769
you gon' need my secret move.

19:08.873 --> 19:10.927
- Let's go, Grove.
- Yeah, Grover, you got this!

19:10.962 --> 19:12.981
- Bust that breezy's ass.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

19:13.016 --> 19:16.377
<i> And in three, two, one.</i>

19:16.380 --> 19:18.814
<i> Game time!</i>

19:24.287 --> 19:27.356
- Damn, little girl.
- So sorry.

19:27.358 --> 19:30.058
Ha!
Get 'em a body bag, Suzy!

19:37.100 --> 19:38.334
In yo' mouth!

19:38.369 --> 19:42.239
- Bust that thang open!
- Yeah, Grover, you my nig!

19:47.343 --> 19:50.783
Now hit her
with that secret sauce.

19:53.184 --> 19:55.654
Man, my dick
is so hard right now.

19:55.689 --> 19:57.153
Cook her, nigga!

20:05.196 --> 20:08.496
So sorry.

20:12.435 --> 20:15.365
Aye, man.
Bitch cold.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.839
So what was good with
that elite basketball camp?

20:18.843 --> 20:19.475
Dem meatballs!

20:19.510 --> 20:22.580
Aw, man, we was way too
league for that bullshit.

20:22.615 --> 20:23.980
It was like playing
with a bunch

20:23.981 --> 20:26.082
- of mark-ass benchwarmers.
- Aye, man.

20:26.117 --> 20:28.517
Even though you got that ass
spanked, I still respect you.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.089
I would have given you
my secret, secret move,

20:31.124 --> 20:33.817
- but I ain't no snitch, though.
- You know what 'Trel?

20:33.824 --> 20:36.092
You ain't the smartest, but you
ain't such a bad brother after all.

20:36.093 --> 20:39.433
Oh, nigga, I know.
That's why I got you this.

20:39.468 --> 20:40.162
Suzy gave you that?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.057
Naw, I robbed that ass.
Now let's dip.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.196
I think Suzy's management
called one time.
