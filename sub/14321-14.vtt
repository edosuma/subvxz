WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.500
[theme music playing]

01:15.583 --> 01:17.000
[sighing]

01:17.708 --> 01:20.583
You all have no idea
what you got there.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.000
What I'd give!

01:22.458 --> 01:24.166
[grunts in frustration]

01:25.000 --> 01:26.583
[sobbing]

01:53.625 --> 01:55.708
[whizzing]

01:55.708 --> 01:56.708
[explosion]

01:58.458 --> 01:59.875
Who started the war?

02:09.416 --> 02:10.708
[creature moaning]

02:14.375 --> 02:16.125
[sniffing]

02:16.125 --> 02:17.375
Something's down there.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.083
And it don't smell human.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.458
Whoa! Cockroaches from Mars.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.166
Large economy size.

02:27.958 --> 02:29.333
[lasers zapping]

02:29.333 --> 02:32.291
[grunts] This should be fun.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.208
[grunting]

02:40.625 --> 02:43.708
Go ahead, pal. Take a good look.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.875
[all exclaiming]

02:50.458 --> 02:51.583
What?

02:52.250 --> 02:53.708
Just like roaches,

02:53.708 --> 02:56.250
find one,
you know there's plenty more.

02:58.125 --> 02:59.375
[grunting]

03:01.833 --> 03:02.958
[screaming]

03:03.583 --> 03:06.458
Hey, what do you...

03:06.458 --> 03:07.708
[groaning]

03:10.458 --> 03:11.583
[grunts]

03:11.583 --> 03:12.958
What was in that?

03:12.958 --> 03:15.375
[groaning]

03:19.833 --> 03:22.583
What determination. What vigor!

03:23.375 --> 03:25.125
Just as we expected.

03:25.125 --> 03:28.458
He will make an excellent
addition to our specimens.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.708
Take him to the ship.

03:34.416 --> 03:35.708
[knocking at door]

03:35.708 --> 03:37.291
Come in.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.708
What's this?

03:38.708 --> 03:40.583
The most beautiful
woman in town,

03:40.583 --> 03:42.000
alone on a Saturday night.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.500
[sighs]

03:43.500 --> 03:46.708
I was reading about love
and adventure, Gambit.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.250
What more could a gal want?

03:48.250 --> 03:51.000
[chuckles]
The real thing, chere.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Gambit at your service.

03:53.708 --> 03:57.833
[sighs] Even crazy swamp rats
need a gal they can touch.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.375
[phone ringing]

03:59.375 --> 04:01.875
Now who in the world
would be calling...

04:01.875 --> 04:03.250
Hello?

04:03.250 --> 04:06.458
Cody? How on Earth
did you find me?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.875
I can't believe he's here.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.458
I wonder what he looks like now.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.708
Oh, my goodness.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.333
It's really you.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.000
Do I want it to be you?

04:27.833 --> 04:29.583
[clears throat]

04:30.375 --> 04:32.333
Cody? Cody!

04:32.875 --> 04:33.958
Possum!

04:34.583 --> 04:36.750
Don't you dare call me that!

04:36.750 --> 04:38.000
[tires screeching]

04:38.000 --> 04:39.125
-No, stop!
-[car honks]

04:39.125 --> 04:40.458
[Rogue] [grunting] Got you!

04:40.458 --> 04:43.125
I remember those arms.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.583
You blame fool!
You could have got hurt.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.458
Not as long as
you're doing the catching.

04:47.458 --> 04:52.000
Oh, honey-tongue, Cody.
Nothing's changed.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.708
Except, I finally found you.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.416
Haven't you heard of
a forwarding address?

04:57.958 --> 05:00.875
Well, that's a long story.

05:00.875 --> 05:04.625
Then how's about
you telling it to me
over dinner?

05:04.625 --> 05:07.875
Oh... You always could
read a gal's mind.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.458
And we do have
a little catching up to do.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.958
Starting with "Possum."

05:18.125 --> 05:21.708
They're like family, I guess.
They're mutants, too,

05:21.708 --> 05:25.125
so they don't get their
britches in a twist
like everyone else.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.458
You never gave me a chance.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.875
You left before
I got out of the hospital.

05:30.708 --> 05:33.625
But now, I have you back.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.333
Whoa, partner.
One coma in a lifetime

05:38.333 --> 05:40.291
is usually enough
for most fellows.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.458
There's nothing
to fear, darling.
We can be together.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.750
I figured it out.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.375
[stammers] I wish
I could believe you.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.166
You used to want this, Rogue.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.166
Well, things are different now.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.500
All that love you got
pent up inside,

05:55.500 --> 05:58.166
well, finally
you can let it out.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.458
Cody, I...

05:59.458 --> 06:01.458
Do you still love me, Rogue?

06:01.458 --> 06:03.250
'Cause I sure still love you.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.583
There's just no use.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.583
I said, do you love me?

06:09.958 --> 06:13.000
That's all that matters.
You and me.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.500
We're gonna be together
like it was always meant to be.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.625
Everything's gonna be okay.

06:18.625 --> 06:19.833
[electricity buzzing]

06:19.833 --> 06:21.625
[gasps] What's that?

06:21.625 --> 06:23.125
[shushing]

06:27.125 --> 06:29.250
[laughing] Cody!

06:29.250 --> 06:32.125
Cody, I can touch you.
It's true.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.625
[groans]

06:33.625 --> 06:35.583
What have I done?

06:35.583 --> 06:37.458
[creature growling]

06:49.583 --> 06:51.125
[grunts softly]

06:51.833 --> 06:53.625
I'd hoped it was a nightmare.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.291
[grunting]

07:02.250 --> 07:04.625
[groans] Do I feel lousy.

07:06.583 --> 07:07.583
[sniffing]

07:07.583 --> 07:09.416
[coughs] Whoa!

07:09.416 --> 07:11.250
These bugs just don't look ugly.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.708
[sniffing] Wait,
there's something else here.

07:14.958 --> 07:17.875
What do you know? It's alive.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.416
Tough setup, pal.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.875
Bet it wasn't your idea
to be a roach motel.

07:23.708 --> 07:24.875
[exclaims]

07:24.875 --> 07:26.500
[groaning]

07:26.500 --> 07:28.708
I was hoping
you'd try that again.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.166
[panting]

07:32.458 --> 07:34.416
[grunting]

07:49.458 --> 07:50.583
[grunting]

08:01.166 --> 08:03.875
-[electricity buzzing]
-[screaming]

08:07.000 --> 08:08.458
Playtime's over.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.708
He was more powerful
than we thought.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.583
[clan mother] All the better.

08:18.583 --> 08:22.416
He and his friends will make
a strong addition to the colony.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.583
The first of many
from this planet.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.333
Especially this one.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.750
-Morning, sleepyhead.
-Mm. Morning?

08:49.750 --> 08:53.250
[exclaims] Did I sleep
all night in a park?

08:54.083 --> 08:55.958
Why didn't you wake me up?

08:55.958 --> 08:58.458
Why, I didn't have the heart to.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.583
How do you feel?

09:00.125 --> 09:02.708
[sighing] Wonderful,

09:02.708 --> 09:06.166
like I'm floating. I'm so happy.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.500
Then run away with me,
right now!

09:08.500 --> 09:10.833
I know
a great place for a weekend.

09:10.833 --> 09:14.458
What, just like that?
I don't know.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.083
Oh, shoot. Yeah, I'll do it.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.458
Who says an X-Man
can't have a little fun?

09:19.458 --> 09:21.000
That's great!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I have to tell the others first.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.083
Well, of course, my love,
of course.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.875
-[groaning]
-[keypad beeping]

09:35.875 --> 09:37.625
-[line ringing]
-Professor.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.458
[phone ringing]

09:39.458 --> 09:41.458
Logan? What is it?

09:41.458 --> 09:45.583
[Wolverine] [breathing heavily]
They're here. You must...

09:45.583 --> 09:48.291
[groaning] Roaches...

09:48.291 --> 09:51.833
Too many... No!

09:51.833 --> 09:53.083
Where are you?

09:53.083 --> 09:54.500
[Wolverine] [groaning]

09:55.708 --> 09:57.875
[screaming]

09:57.875 --> 09:59.958
Wolverine don't
normally make sense,

09:59.958 --> 10:02.000
but this makes
less sense than usual.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.875
I shall trace the call's origin.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.375
There are you, chere.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.708
Not nice making
poor Gambit worry about you.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.750
I know this is sudden,
Professor,

10:11.750 --> 10:15.375
but I need
some personal time off.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.166
This is a bad time, Rogue.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.291
Wolverine is in
some sort of trouble.

10:19.291 --> 10:23.458
In all the years I've been here,
I never asked for
a minute for myself.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.458
Looks like you all got
plenty of folks
to babysit Logan.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.625
Rogue, is this gentleman
your guest?

10:29.625 --> 10:31.083
So that's Cody?

10:31.708 --> 10:33.458
This is what's so personal?

10:33.458 --> 10:36.875
It's none
of your blame business,
Mr. Ladies Man!

10:36.875 --> 10:39.416
-Or any of you!
-Rogue!

10:39.416 --> 10:41.333
Why this joker suddenly turn up?

10:41.333 --> 10:44.500
And why did Rogue
bring him here?
It's not like her.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.250
[clears throat]

10:46.250 --> 10:49.750
Let us contemplate
less personal matters, Gambit.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.833
Wolverine seemed
in acute distress.

10:51.833 --> 10:55.416
Yes, find him at once,
and report back to me.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.208
I kept you from your work,
haven't I?

11:02.208 --> 11:03.958
They can handle it.

11:03.958 --> 11:07.583
I don't want to leave you.
Not when I just found you.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.125
I know you'll love this place.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.250
[groans]

11:13.250 --> 11:15.125
Sugar, are you all right?

11:15.125 --> 11:17.291
Yeah. Let's get going.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.833
[Rogue] Stop being
so mysterious.

11:22.833 --> 11:26.416
You promised
to let it be a surprise.

11:26.416 --> 11:30.000
Well, I hope this place
ain't too far out of the way.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.083
[Storm] There's someone
down there, on the sand.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.958
It's Logan.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.333
Wolverine! Can you hear me?

11:51.333 --> 11:52.583
Stay back.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.708
[groaning]

11:55.708 --> 11:58.583
Logan, what has happened to you?

11:58.583 --> 12:02.833
I'll be okay, Storm.
It's them we got to worry about.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.208
[Beast] What on Earth?

12:06.250 --> 12:09.708
Remember, do not damage them.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.708
You want to play
with Gambit? Okay!

12:25.958 --> 12:27.708
[grunting]

12:27.708 --> 12:31.083
Let him go, roach,
or your head is shish kebab!

12:32.583 --> 12:35.500
Be gone, hissing vermin!

12:38.000 --> 12:40.250
[gasps] That's the Blackbird.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.375
[groaning]

12:41.375 --> 12:43.333
What's going on?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.708
What's wrong with you, Cody?
And why are we here?

12:49.458 --> 12:52.583
It was the only way, darling.
I swear.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
[Storm] [groans]

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Storm!

12:56.583 --> 13:00.500
What are those things?
What've they done to her?

13:00.500 --> 13:03.166
They said they
wouldn't hurt anyone.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.583
What is happening?

13:05.583 --> 13:06.833
[Rogue] [gasping]

13:09.291 --> 13:14.083
Any suggestion as how to
deal with your newfound friends
would be welcome.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.208
[groaning]

13:15.208 --> 13:17.000
[screaming]

13:18.750 --> 13:20.000
[both groaning]

13:20.000 --> 13:23.125
Logan! What is happening to you?

13:23.125 --> 13:24.583
[growling]

13:25.125 --> 13:27.625
[screaming]

13:30.708 --> 13:33.416
You brought us here! For them!

13:33.416 --> 13:36.291
They didn't tell
me about the others!

13:36.291 --> 13:39.083
It's for the best, darling.
You'll see!

13:39.083 --> 13:40.875
[groaning]

13:41.958 --> 13:43.458
[screaming]

13:43.458 --> 13:45.708
[Cody] They need us, Rogue.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.208
Just like I need you.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.958
[groaning]

13:52.583 --> 13:54.708
It's happening to me, too,
isn't it?

13:55.833 --> 13:59.708
Professor?
Professor, we need your help.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.708
[Wolverine] [groaning]

14:04.291 --> 14:05.708
[screaming]

14:08.458 --> 14:10.625
[grunting]

14:10.625 --> 14:14.750
I'm gonna get this out of me!

14:17.333 --> 14:19.708
[screaming]

14:30.125 --> 14:32.458
How could you do this to me?

14:32.458 --> 14:36.333
Rogue, I love you.
Don't you see?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.000
This way we can
finally be together.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.875
We can touch, we can kiss.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.333
[screaming]

14:44.333 --> 14:46.625
No! I won't let it happen!

14:46.625 --> 14:49.166
There is no use
fighting it, Rogue.

14:49.166 --> 14:52.166
You were dusted with spores
while you slept.

14:52.875 --> 14:56.208
Soon you will have the honor
of being in the colony.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.458
Never! [groans]

14:58.458 --> 15:02.875
The creation is hard. Be strong.

15:03.583 --> 15:08.875
Thousands will soon
depend on you,
as they have depended on me.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.583
We do not have
children as you do.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.875
We need host bodies
for our race to continue.

15:16.500 --> 15:21.500
As I prepare for the passing,
you will learn from me.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.291
Do not be
hard on your friend, Rogue,

15:25.291 --> 15:28.583
he never chose to be one of us.

15:28.583 --> 15:32.583
You mean,
you just used him to get to me?

15:32.583 --> 15:37.375
Yes, we have been watching you
and your planet for decades.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.458
You were too strong for us.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.958
We could not risk
attacking you directly.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.416
I'm sorry, Rogue. I...

15:45.416 --> 15:46.875
Sorry?

15:46.875 --> 15:49.708
Cody, it's me
who should be sorry.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.625
I've done it again, haven't I?

15:51.625 --> 15:55.333
If it weren't for me,
you'd be home, safe and sound.

15:55.333 --> 15:59.291
Without you.
Rogue, I do love you.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.416
So finally we can be together.

16:02.416 --> 16:06.500
[crying] This isn't
what I wanted.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
[screaming]

16:07.500 --> 16:08.583
[Wolverine] No!

16:10.000 --> 16:12.875
We will be together!
You can't stop this!

16:14.083 --> 16:16.333
[grunting] Wanna bet, pal?

16:18.416 --> 16:20.625
Wolverine, don't hurt him!

16:21.833 --> 16:23.000
[hissing]

16:27.000 --> 16:29.708
Absorb my healing powers, Rogue.

16:29.708 --> 16:33.875
Force it out of you,
like I did for myself.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.291
[groaning]

16:36.250 --> 16:37.708
What does he mean?

16:37.708 --> 16:41.333
I took his powers.
I can stop the spores!

16:41.333 --> 16:42.708
[Cody] Don't do that.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.583
Rogue, we could be together,

16:44.583 --> 16:46.958
like we dreamed
since we were kids.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.000
You said you still love me.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.625
I'm sorry, Cody. I'm so sorry.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.291
Rogue! I can't lose you again.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.291
[grunting]

17:14.625 --> 17:18.458
You are not leaving!
Our future depends on you.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.583
Then you have no future!

17:20.583 --> 17:23.416
You never asked me, lady.

17:24.875 --> 17:28.833
My spores.
The host bodies must not escape.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.583
Launch the ship!

17:32.583 --> 17:33.958
[Wolverine] The ship's moving.

17:33.958 --> 17:37.333
They're leaving.
Rogue, we got to hustle.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.208
Out of my way, roaches.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.708
Professor, help us.

17:44.708 --> 17:48.416
[Professor] I've been trying,
Storm, but the creatures'
minds are impenetrable.

17:48.416 --> 17:52.458
However, I do sense
another presence.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.875
The Acanti.
What an extraordinary being.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.250
Gentle, fast.

18:01.250 --> 18:04.875
Of course.
The colony needed it as a ship.

18:05.583 --> 18:11.083
Enslaving its mind,
it remains conscious,
but unable to do anything

18:11.083 --> 18:15.083
to stop the colony's
implacable search for hosts.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.875
What a terrible fate.

18:16.875 --> 18:20.166
Perhaps we can
help each other, my friend.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.000
Go on. I'll hold them off.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.125
-[Rogue] [gasps]
-I said move!

18:25.125 --> 18:26.333
Where?

18:26.333 --> 18:27.708
Secure them!

18:28.958 --> 18:30.708
Secure this!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.125
[screaming]

18:41.000 --> 18:42.458
[grunting]

18:45.416 --> 18:46.875
[screaming]

18:46.875 --> 18:50.458
Good. Bring her
to the spore chamber.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.333
What about this one?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.583
He has the power
to purge the spores.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.500
We did not know this.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.416
Get rid of him.

18:58.416 --> 19:01.208
No! No, stop! You can't do this!

19:01.208 --> 19:02.208
[Acanti] [vocalizing]

19:02.208 --> 19:04.083
[groaning]

19:05.250 --> 19:09.875
[screaming] Stop!
Stop that excruciating sound!

19:09.875 --> 19:13.416
What do you mean?
It's... It's beautiful.

19:13.416 --> 19:16.416
[vocalizing continues]

19:16.416 --> 19:18.708
Who freed the Acanti?

19:18.708 --> 19:21.583
The Acanti? Who's the Acanti?

19:21.583 --> 19:24.125
Right here, Rogue. Right here.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.958
[vocalizing]

19:41.625 --> 19:43.375
Chere, come on. Hurry.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.833
Cody, please come with us.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.500
I bet the Professor
can find some way to help you.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.875
[hissing]

19:49.875 --> 19:52.875
Let him go!
He's one of them now.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.750
Bye, old girl. We owe you one.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.000
-You did all you could, kid.
-[crying]

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Take it from a guy
who's lost a few.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.875
[Acanti vocalizing]

20:22.000 --> 20:23.625
[theme music playing]
