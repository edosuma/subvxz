A NETFLIX SERIES

00:25.541 --> 00:27.000
<i>Honey…</i>

00:31.500 --> 00:32.833
You're like me.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.541
<i>You've completed the first veil.</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:10.708
<i>You are now initiated into the light.</i>

01:11.541 --> 01:13.958
Relax, Sofía. I know what you seek.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.083
Give in.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.833
Honey.

01:41.916 --> 01:43.833
Don't be afraid.

01:43.916 --> 01:44.958
Mom?

01:46.375 --> 01:48.375
Stay away from your sister.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.416
What?

01:50.916 --> 01:53.500
Complete the five veils.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.666
Come to me.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.958
Give me strength, Mom.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.708
Don't let anyone in.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.458
CIVIL GUARD
DO NOT CROSS

03:12.750 --> 03:15.541
-This won't change anything.
-No harm in trying.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.250
<i>Looking for me?</i>

03:32.500 --> 03:33.541
I did it.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.500
I killed him.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.166
Did he do something?

03:38.458 --> 03:39.583
Did he attack you?

03:41.166 --> 03:44.166
Sandra, you gotta give me something.
Try to remember, please.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.000
He didn't do anything.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.000
Please let me go.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.666
<i>Listen, Sandra.</i>

04:02.333 --> 04:04.125
Something happened here, okay?

04:04.625 --> 04:07.166
Something neither of us understand yet.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.291
You saw the mess.
Someone ransacked the place.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.750
Maybe they broke in to steal something.

04:13.833 --> 04:17.291
All we found in your room was a chalice.
Did you take anything else?

04:17.916 --> 04:18.916
Did you?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.041
-I don't know.
-Sandra.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.833
You didn't murder
that priest just because.

04:25.916 --> 04:27.083
I don't buy that.

04:27.666 --> 04:30.666
There has to be a reason.
Nothing about this murder makes sense.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.291
I'm as lost as you are. I swear.

04:34.583 --> 04:35.500
Take it easy.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.833
There's this drug dealer, Mani.
Word is he and Ezcaray were involved.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.000
What if he did this
to pin the murder on you?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
Guillén.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.041
I killed him.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.208
<i>After the mass suicide</i>

04:54.291 --> 04:56.500
and Father Ezcaray's murder,

04:56.583 --> 04:59.416
things have been very tense around here.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.833
-Pablo and Elena's daughters.
-Yes.

05:01.916 --> 05:04.791
They're still in town.
The police are looking for their parents.

05:05.666 --> 05:07.500
Yes, they're still in town.

05:07.583 --> 05:12.333
But Elena and Pablo are the ones
who need to face the music and explain…

05:12.416 --> 05:14.458
He probably thinks
he's setting a good example.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.791
Mar, please. He's your father.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.875
Families like yours.

05:19.958 --> 05:23.166
Your daughter, Mar,
is a close friend of Eva,

05:23.666 --> 05:26.416
the daughter of the main suspects.

05:27.125 --> 05:32.083
<i>…to also mourn the loss of Olga Serrano,</i>
<i>another resident of Feria.</i>

05:32.166 --> 05:38.333
<i>She leaves behind her husband and one son,</i>
<i>Chisco, as he is known around here.</i>

05:38.833 --> 05:43.166
<i>Well, Olga wasn't exactly</i>
<i>what you'd call a normal person.</i>

05:43.250 --> 05:47.500
<i>She had mental problems</i>
<i>and struggled with addiction.</i>

05:47.583 --> 05:52.041
<i>She happened to meet her end</i>
<i>through the Cult of Light.</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:56.666
<i>But she could've gone any number of ways.</i>
<i>She was on the wrong path.</i>

05:56.750 --> 06:00.291
<i>Cults prey on the weakest among us.</i>

06:00.375 --> 06:04.500
<i>Police believe Elena Vera</i>
<i>may have died inside the mine.</i>

06:04.583 --> 06:08.000
<i>But apparently, Pablo Soto did not enter.</i>

06:08.083 --> 06:13.375
<i>As we have seen, the force</i>
<i>is doing sweeps of the woods around Feria.</i>

06:13.458 --> 06:15.833
<i>They hope to find him soon.</i>

06:17.125 --> 06:18.791
<i>That's right.</i>

06:19.291 --> 06:21.791
<i>It's really a shame</i>
<i>what Elena and Pablo did.</i>

06:22.291 --> 06:23.125
<i>A real shame.</i>

06:24.250 --> 06:27.541
<i>We are all trying</i>
<i>to understand what happened,</i>

06:27.625 --> 06:32.291
<i>what made so many normal people</i>
<i>decide to end their lives.</i>

06:32.375 --> 06:35.916
<i>Yes. We've always been</i>
<i>a working-class town.</i>

06:36.791 --> 06:40.375
<i>Once the mine closed,</i>
<i>Feria had to reinvent itself.</i>

06:41.041 --> 06:45.416
<i>-The mine was the lifeblood</i>…
-Sorry.

06:46.666 --> 06:50.333
<i>But we've always managed</i>
<i>to forge ahead together.</i>

06:52.625 --> 06:56.458
<i>After last week's mass suicide…</i>

07:03.208 --> 07:07.500
Eva, the police returned
some things they took during the search.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.666
-I just made coffee. Want some?
-Thanks. I could use it.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.041
What are you doing?

07:19.791 --> 07:21.333
Putting it where it belongs.

07:22.458 --> 07:26.041
Sofía, please take the photo down.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.708
Keep it in your room if you want.
I'm not asking for much.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.541
Dad's inhaler.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.125
He needs it. You know how bad he gets.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.375
You're still insisting they're alive?
Fine. Go ahead.

07:47.541 --> 07:49.791
But I'm getting tired of always giving in.

07:49.875 --> 07:53.125
I never told you
to blindly follow what the police said.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.375
We're in Feria because of you.
We came back home because of you.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.208
If we didn't, you'd have thrown a fit.

08:00.208 --> 08:03.250
I didn't tell anyone about Mani
or that crazy stuff about Mom.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.708
Can't you do me one damn favor?
I don't want to see them.

08:08.791 --> 08:09.708
Girls.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.500
Are you that ashamed of them?

08:15.750 --> 08:16.916
Put that shit away.

08:17.708 --> 08:18.541
No.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.791
Fine.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.791
I'm the older sister, so do as I say.

08:23.875 --> 08:24.875
Leave the photo.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.000
I said leave it there!

08:26.083 --> 08:27.583
-Sofía!
-Give it to me.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.375
Girls, please! Eva!

08:29.916 --> 08:31.791
This has gone way too far.

08:35.791 --> 08:38.416
Hate them all you want,
but you're still their daughter.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.291
You can't change that.

08:45.208 --> 08:48.375
Arguing won't make things better, Eva.

08:50.666 --> 08:54.083
-We have to take things slow with Sofía.
-With Sofía?

08:54.666 --> 08:56.458
It's always "poor Sofía."

08:57.916 --> 09:00.375
Like I don't need help?

09:41.416 --> 09:43.125
Going out to catch some bugs?

10:54.125 --> 10:55.291
I think it worked.

10:56.416 --> 10:57.833
Snowflake knew it would.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.791
Samuel says to put this on.

11:17.791 --> 11:18.625
<i>Honey.</i>

11:19.166 --> 11:20.291
<i>Come to me.</i>

11:22.291 --> 11:25.208
To get her to open the gate,
we first must get rid of Eva.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.541
She must be freed.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.083
What was that about my sister?

11:45.708 --> 11:47.375
Stay in bed, honey.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.875
And my mother?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.791
Where is she?

11:50.875 --> 11:51.708
Here

11:52.416 --> 11:53.625
or at the reservoir?

11:55.375 --> 11:59.000
I'm not sure what happened,
but… I saw my mother.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.166
There is nothing
in the reservoir or in this house.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.875
What you saw is inside you.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.500
Because you are a perfect one.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.458
Like your mother.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.583
It's time to open the second veil, Sofía.

12:15.625 --> 12:18.041
The first was my hands sinking into you.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.625
The second one will be your baptism.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.208
Do you want to be closer to Elena?

12:28.875 --> 12:30.791
This is the way to the kingdom.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.375
What is the kingdom?

12:36.375 --> 12:38.166
Elena was showing you the way.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.125
No one died at the mine.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.458
Your mother took them to the kingdom.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.125
We can show you how to be with her.

12:52.791 --> 12:56.375
If you want to be by Elena's side,
you must go through the gate.

12:57.791 --> 12:59.666
Only you can do it.

13:02.708 --> 13:04.250
But for it to open…

13:06.625 --> 13:10.041
you must let go of what binds you
to this world of shadows.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.416
You must complete the five veils

13:14.791 --> 13:18.125
and let your soul hang in the ether.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.000
Forget about Eva.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.500
Keep away from her
if you want to be with your mother again.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.041
Shit. I forgot my wallet.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.291
I'll pay you another day, Perla.
I don't have my wallet.

13:36.791 --> 13:39.333
I have to balance
the register when I close.

13:40.416 --> 13:42.208
But I'm going to pay you.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.166
How many times have I kept a tab?

13:48.750 --> 13:49.625
What?

13:49.708 --> 13:52.125
What are you staring at?
Something on my face?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.041
Shit. Okay.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.333
Just what I needed.

13:57.041 --> 13:59.000
Now you can run and tell everyone

13:59.083 --> 14:01.916
that the murderers' daughter
is crazy <i>and</i> a drunk.

14:02.666 --> 14:04.208
How much for the bottle?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.333
It's 1,500 pesetas.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.166
I'll buy two.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.416
EL PERLA SUPERMARKET

14:26.541 --> 14:28.250
Get me out of here.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.250
Come on.

15:26.708 --> 15:27.583
Eva.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.083
Look at me.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.458
I'm sorry, okay?

15:37.125 --> 15:38.250
It's okay.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.875
I'm not gonna bullshit you.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.250
I was scared.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.916
It's fine, Raúl.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.250
It's not every day
you find out your girlfriend

15:52.333 --> 15:53.916
is a member of the Manson Family.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.375
-Eva.
-What?

16:09.250 --> 16:10.666
Sit down with that woman.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.666
The one who interviewed Lozano.

16:13.916 --> 16:15.708
Show everyone how normal you are.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.583
What?

16:22.666 --> 16:23.666
Nothing.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.958
It's just nice when someone cares.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.458
Sofía is living in a fantasy.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.666
She might have seen Mani.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.250
-Remember him?
-Yeah.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.208
She believes he knows
something about her mom.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.166
Elena and Mani knew each other?

17:00.666 --> 17:03.708
Mani's parents died
in an accident when he was a kid.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.333
He came to live in the shelter

17:05.833 --> 17:09.458
and failed all through
high school until he dropped out.

17:09.958 --> 17:12.791
Elena tried to help him,
but he was a lost cause.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.875
Are you thinking about Ezcaray?

17:26.500 --> 17:27.833
You arrested the perp.

17:28.583 --> 17:32.208
-Yeah, but it makes no sense.
-Does anything in Feria?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.916
Pablo and Elena were normal people.

17:35.416 --> 17:38.625
Normal people don't turn into
cult leaders overnight.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.208
You know it wasn't overnight.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.333
The letters Elena was getting.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.041
Some go back more than ten years.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.416
-Can I see?
-Be my guest.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.666
It's like they were written
by patients in an insane asylum.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.833
It's right in your wheelhouse.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.833
<i>"Some beings are touched by the light."</i>

18:10.666 --> 18:13.166
<i>"Beings in touch with the kingdom."</i>

18:15.416 --> 18:18.083
<i>"Perfect beings like you, Elena."</i>

18:19.750 --> 18:22.125
<i>"Dekta has freed me from my family."</i>

18:24.791 --> 18:28.500
<i>"I am ready to be baptized,</i>
<i>to leave the flesh behind."</i>

18:44.916 --> 18:47.416
-You're familiar with Mani, right?
-Yup.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.375
He's spent a night or two
in the holding cell.

18:51.958 --> 18:54.166
The one with the blue hair.
Real piece of work.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.625
What do you know about him and Ezcaray?

19:01.791 --> 19:03.208
Is it true they had a thing?

19:04.375 --> 19:06.083
I stay out of Church business.

19:07.416 --> 19:08.416
Sure.

19:10.333 --> 19:14.416
I, on the other hand,
love to peek under the robe.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.208
I'm a perv.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.083
Shut the door.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.041
I want a lawyer.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.791
Bad news, Mani.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.000
This could get you in serious trouble.

19:46.916 --> 19:47.791
Or

19:48.291 --> 19:49.958
we can forget the drugs

19:50.833 --> 19:53.166
and chat about what we really care about.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.791
Why does Sofía think
you know something about Elena?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.250
Beats me.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.166
I got nothing to do with that kid.

20:06.583 --> 20:09.125
Sure, I might've sold her sister
a joint or two. So?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.458
-I don't even know her name--
-Eva.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.208
Right, Eva.

20:13.791 --> 20:16.708
I got rules, okay?
I don't do business with kids.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.541
You're a good Christian, Mani.

20:18.625 --> 20:21.000
Not involved with things
like the Cult of Light.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.583
You go to Mass every Sunday.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.541
Were you sad Father Ezcaray was killed?

20:30.333 --> 20:33.458
Word on the street is
you two were… good friends.

20:37.041 --> 20:40.083
The world is full of sleazebag priests.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.041
Ezcaray was one, isn't that right?

20:42.583 --> 20:43.625
Now, Mani.

20:46.583 --> 20:49.208
He asked you a question. Yes or no?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.416
Answer if you don't want this to get ugly.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.666
You arrested that lady, right?

20:55.958 --> 20:56.958
The cop.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.041
She did it.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.166
That's for a judge to decide.

21:03.708 --> 21:04.958
Where were you that night?

21:06.250 --> 21:09.291
You went to the church, Mani.
You and Ezcaray had a fight.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.875
You trashed the sacristy.

21:10.958 --> 21:12.916
I was outside the mine!

21:15.750 --> 21:19.833
I was getting gear ready with Serafín.
I help him with his orichalcum.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.083
Serafín was a miner.

21:26.166 --> 21:29.875
He spent too much time underground,
and it fried his brain.

21:30.375 --> 21:31.958
He thinks the mine contains

21:32.541 --> 21:33.833
that orichalcum stuff.

21:43.041 --> 21:45.458
DO NOT ENTER

22:08.291 --> 22:10.041
LETTERS TO ELENA

22:10.125 --> 22:12.416
ELENA, HELP ME CROSS

22:12.500 --> 22:14.750
HELP ME

22:17.666 --> 22:19.625
FIFTH VEIL

22:19.708 --> 22:21.500
WORLD OF SHADOWS

22:22.208 --> 22:24.583
EXCERPTS FROM THEODOTUS

22:31.833 --> 22:33.250
<i>"On the path to the light,</i>

22:33.333 --> 22:36.708
<i>the perfect ones will be aided</i>
<i>by those from the kingdom."</i>

22:37.208 --> 22:40.583
<i>"I am the light that is above all things."</i>

22:41.666 --> 22:43.166
<i>"I am everything."</i>

22:43.250 --> 22:47.333
<i>"Everything came forth from</i>
<i>and returned to me."</i>

22:49.541 --> 22:51.708
<i>"He who does not hate</i>

22:51.791 --> 22:53.625
<i>cannot be a disciple of mine."</i>

22:54.250 --> 22:59.291
<i>"But he who drinks from my mouth will have</i>
<i>the hidden things revealed to him."</i>

24:38.833 --> 24:39.666
Hey.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.916
I heard what happened at the supermarket…

24:44.000 --> 24:45.416
What a bunch of assholes.

24:46.708 --> 24:49.666
Yeah, well, I wasn't having
my best day either.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.458
Are you up for…?

24:55.541 --> 24:59.041
Maybe we could grab
some chocolate and churros.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.750
I had a rough night.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.416
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

25:06.708 --> 25:08.583
I heard you and Raúl…

25:10.250 --> 25:11.750
We're fine, Mar.

25:12.250 --> 25:15.541
I hope I'm wrong,
but Raúl is never gonna stick up for you.

25:16.375 --> 25:17.291
Be careful.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.083
Who was that?

25:24.958 --> 25:26.708
Someone selling Bibles.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.125
Just what I needed.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.750
Is it okay if they do
the interview this afternoon? Yeah?

25:36.666 --> 25:39.041
That way, we can air it
on tomorrow's show.

25:39.541 --> 25:42.708
-Sure you don't want to do it live?
-Prerecorded is fine.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.875
I've got a headache.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.833
Ah, you must be little Sofía.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.750
And you're that bitch Ana Sánchez.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.166
Jeez.

25:55.666 --> 25:57.833
A "good morning" would've sufficed.

25:57.916 --> 26:00.125
-Now apologize.
-Why should I?

26:02.875 --> 26:05.416
Because they're gonna make
my folks out to be murderers?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.958
Or because they've been showing
Chisco's mom all day?

26:08.041 --> 26:09.083
Just curious.

26:09.166 --> 26:13.416
Look, I understand you're angry
and that you don't want to be on TV,

26:13.500 --> 26:17.208
but your sister Eva
is trying to get the truth out.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.333
Sofía, can we talk for a second?

26:21.666 --> 26:22.666
About what?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.416
Your shitty attitude, for starters.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.375
Sofía, this isn't about money or fame.

26:31.875 --> 26:33.458
I'm doing this to help us.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.833
When did I ask for your help?

26:37.541 --> 26:41.041
I'm going to say we didn't know anything.
That we're just two more victims.

26:41.916 --> 26:43.666
Victims of who?

26:45.125 --> 26:46.250
Mom and Dad?

26:48.166 --> 26:50.541
Sofía, someone's here to see you.

26:56.083 --> 26:57.583
You're making a mistake.

26:59.041 --> 27:01.083
You're gonna regret it.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.708
<i>Serafín?</i>

27:10.291 --> 27:12.041
Did you buy the razor?

27:12.916 --> 27:14.166
I look like a bum.

27:20.333 --> 27:21.333
Serafín?

27:25.083 --> 27:26.958
You <i>are</i> a sorry sight.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.541
Why didn’t it occur to me before?

27:28.625 --> 27:30.458
Looking around the woods…

27:32.541 --> 27:35.500
Where could he have gone?
Here, with crazy Serafín.

27:36.416 --> 27:38.333
I'm here as Marcos, not as a cop.

27:44.333 --> 27:47.125
Twenty years ago,
we said we'd forget and move on.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.125
I won't let that change.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.125
You need to get out of here.

27:55.583 --> 27:56.833
She was really pretty.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.625
She wasn't well.

28:05.875 --> 28:08.208
What pisses me off
is that Lozano was right.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.875
-She was<i> </i>batshit crazy.
-He didn't know her.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.375
And I did?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.208
Neither of us have
any idea who they were, Sofía.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.833
I've been a real dick to you.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.250
I blamed you
as if you were involved. I'm sorry.

28:34.416 --> 28:37.250
We don't have to feel responsible
for our parents' shit.

28:37.333 --> 28:40.291
They're making us hate them.
It's not fair.

28:42.708 --> 28:45.750
I hate that people are talking about them.
But why deny it?

28:54.458 --> 28:57.000
But what if what we've been told is a lie?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.833
No one died at the mine.

29:02.416 --> 29:04.375
Your mother took them to the kingdom.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.375
I wish my mother had been different.

29:12.875 --> 29:15.041
There are people I want you to meet.

29:16.583 --> 29:19.041
They can show you
who your mother really was.

29:25.250 --> 29:26.666
Did you talk to Mani?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.083
He's got an alibi.

29:29.791 --> 29:32.416
He was outside an old mine.
We went in. It's in ruins.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.166
He went with this guy Serafín.
Marcos confirmed it.

29:36.666 --> 29:40.125
I left Mani in the holding cell.
I caught him with some pills.

29:41.708 --> 29:45.791
The DA wants to close the investigation…
and send you to Madrid for the trial.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.125
I told him to fuck off.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.583
He didn't take it well.
Sensitive bunch, attorneys.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.750
Sandra.

29:58.041 --> 30:00.750
Someone else must have been
in the sacristy that night,

30:00.833 --> 30:03.583
looking for something
in the priest's things.

30:10.416 --> 30:11.750
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.833
There's something I need to tell you
about Corporal Marcos Salazar.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.083
This isn't right.

30:37.583 --> 30:38.916
It's your baptism.

30:39.416 --> 30:41.000
Chisco needs to see it.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.000
His mother was at the mine.

30:44.833 --> 30:46.500
Snowflake doesn't like this.

30:47.416 --> 30:49.416
Samuel is gonna like it even less.

30:52.000 --> 30:52.833
Come on.

31:21.875 --> 31:22.875
Are you ready?

31:27.875 --> 31:29.000
I'll be downstairs.

31:32.541 --> 31:33.833
<i>You're the star of the town.</i>

31:34.416 --> 31:37.000
I hear you wanted to be a model.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041
You have amazing skin.

31:40.166 --> 31:44.125
I suppose with all that's happened,
your dream has been put on hold.

31:46.291 --> 31:49.791
Well, it's not like I was planning
to do much with it.

31:50.291 --> 31:51.625
Well, maybe a little.

31:51.708 --> 31:53.916
After all, who'd want
the face of their brand,

31:54.583 --> 31:58.916
sorry for being so blunt,
to be the daughter of murderers?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.041
What were Pablo and Elena like?

32:17.500 --> 32:20.458
Well… just normal parents.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.916
We know you don't share in their beliefs,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.375
but it's important
people understand Eva is not like them.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.041
That's right.
I've never been a religious person.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.875
So what did your parents believe in?

32:41.958 --> 32:44.208
Did they talk about the Cult of Light?

32:44.291 --> 32:45.458
I don't care.

32:45.541 --> 32:48.416
You don't care
they led 23 people to their deaths?

32:51.625 --> 32:52.500
Are you okay?

32:57.166 --> 32:58.125
Keep rolling.

32:58.208 --> 33:01.166
Nobody's recording any more of this.
Turn those cameras off.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.833
<i>…the daughter of murderers?</i>

33:14.458 --> 33:15.458
Eva?

33:16.708 --> 33:17.750
Eva, it's me.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.250
Eva?

33:38.125 --> 33:39.833
You're scaring me, Eva.

33:40.791 --> 33:43.208
Eva, let me in, please. Eva?

33:44.208 --> 33:45.583
Eva!

33:56.916 --> 33:58.458
Eva…

34:00.458 --> 34:01.458
Let go.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.875
I'm a monster, Raúl.

34:05.291 --> 34:07.166
-Same as them.
-Calm down.

34:07.250 --> 34:09.208
-I am.
-You're not a monster.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.375
It's okay, baby.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.708
That's it. It's okay.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.041
It's okay.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.583
Wake up, champ.

34:54.208 --> 34:55.208
Wake up.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.958
Today is a special day.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.291
Sofía?

35:15.375 --> 35:16.375
Today,

35:17.125 --> 35:20.625
the day of your baptism,
free yourself from your flesh, Sofía.

35:28.083 --> 35:29.291
Don't be nervous.

35:40.291 --> 35:43.125
You want him to be part of it?
Is that why he's here?

35:44.333 --> 35:46.000
Show him what you showed me.

35:47.041 --> 35:49.500
I'm sure it'll be awesome,
but I don't need to see.

35:50.791 --> 35:51.791
Let's go, Sofía.

35:52.875 --> 35:53.708
Darling.

35:55.291 --> 35:56.291
Don't go.

36:01.625 --> 36:02.541
Son.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.750
-Mom?
-Come with me.

36:12.541 --> 36:13.916
I love you.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.375
Flesh is but a prison.

36:25.875 --> 36:27.791
A beautiful prison.

36:28.791 --> 36:30.666
Not unlike Sofía.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.333
How many times
have you dreamed of caressing her?

36:37.791 --> 36:39.916
The warmth of her skin.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.333
You want to make her yours.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.208
Kiss her.

36:44.791 --> 36:45.750
Penetrate her.

36:46.250 --> 36:48.458
This flesh belongs to you or to anyone.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.833
-It's worthless.
-You drugged her. She's not herself.

36:51.916 --> 36:53.583
-Touch her.
-Sofía, let's go.

36:54.250 --> 36:56.083
Leave her alone!

36:56.166 --> 36:57.833
Back off, creep! Leave her alone!

36:58.666 --> 37:00.541
Sofía!

37:00.625 --> 37:02.666
The passion of the Supreme Triad.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.750
Thesis, see me as a torch and let me in.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.583
You, who know the essence of the kingdom,

37:09.083 --> 37:10.750
open the second veil.

37:10.833 --> 37:12.791
Relinquish the flesh.

37:13.291 --> 37:15.083
Sofía!

39:45.166 --> 39:48.083
