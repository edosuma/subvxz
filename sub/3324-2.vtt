00:02.003 --> 00:03.493
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:03.671 --> 00:06.037
- I swear I won't see him again.
- Never again.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.295
They'll be gone an hour.

00:09.135 --> 00:11.251
- What's happening?
- Your body is fighting the bite.

00:11.471 --> 00:13.962
I don't suppose I can assume
you'd call me "grandpa."

00:14.140 --> 00:15.095
Need a hand?

00:15.266 --> 00:17.131
What do you think she's gonna
do with a set of real claws?

00:17.310 --> 00:19.722
We kill them.
We kill them all.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.727
- What are they doing?
- Declaring war.

00:28.988 --> 00:35.234
Um... so far it's an "A" in French
and a "B" minus in econ.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.366
Oh.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.616
What about chemistry?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.490
I'm not sure. Uh...

00:43.336 --> 00:46.078
Midterms are in a few days,
so it could go up.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.417
Well, what's it at now?

00:49.634 --> 00:51.875
- The grade?
- Uh, yeah.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.426
Uh, I'm not sure.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.383
But you just said
it could go up.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.177
It's just--uh, I meant generally.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.982
You wouldn't be lying to me,
would you, Isaac?

01:10.863 --> 01:13.605
- No.
- Then tell me your grade.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.941
| just told you, I don't know.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.244
You wanna take this little
conversation downstairs?

01:20.414 --> 01:21.403
No?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.698
Then tell me the grade, son.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.918
- Dad, the semester's only half over.
- Isaac?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.205
- There's plenty of time--
- Isaac!

01:32.969 --> 01:34.584
It's--it's a "D".

01:37.515 --> 01:38.846
All right.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.345
It's a "D".

01:42.478 --> 01:44.343
I'm not angry.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.891
You know I'm gonna have to find
a way to punish you though.

01:50.069 --> 01:53.561
I have my responsibility
as a parent.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.282
So we'll start with something
simple, like, uh...

01:59.954 --> 02:02.696
Tell you what, you do the dishes
and clean up the kitchen, okay?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.370
Yeah.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.622
Good.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.881
Because I'd really like to
see this place spotless.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.463
Know what I'm saying?
You know?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.970
I mean this entire kitchen.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.635
Yes!

02:22.852 --> 02:25.184
Yeah, absolutely...

02:27.023 --> 02:28.308
spotless.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.405
Well, that was your fault.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.325
You could have blinded me.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.331
Shut up!

02:51.547 --> 02:53.333
It's a scratch!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.672
It's hardly even...

03:08.397 --> 03:09.512
Baac?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.906
Isaac!

03:33.964 --> 03:35.374
Freaks.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.792
Isaac!

04:30.146 --> 04:31.511
Isaac!

04:34.900 --> 04:36.151
Isaac.

04:40.865 --> 04:41.980
Baac?

04:47.538 --> 04:48.948
Baac?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.801
Okay, that's enough.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.632
Let's go!

05:09.018 --> 05:11.760
Isaac, grab your bike
and let's go!

05:14.273 --> 05:15.433
Baac?

05:30.706 --> 05:31.786
Holy--!

05:38.714 --> 05:40.545
No! No! No!

05:42.468 --> 05:43.503
No!

05:44.720 --> 05:45.675
No! No!

07:18.731 --> 07:19.766
Hey.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.477
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to find you.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.980
- Did anyone see you leave?
- No.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.187
No one, I was careful.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.407
What's wrong?
Is it the full moon tomorrow night?

07:31.577 --> 07:34.865
No. No, it's not that. Um...

07:35.080 --> 07:37.913
I just wanted to
ask you some things.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.377
About your--um, your family.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.167
Actually, your grandfather.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.130
Okay, but I don't really know him.

07:50.346 --> 07:53.179
I mean, he's kind ofjust a guy
who sends a check in the mail

07:53.390 --> 07:55.802
- every year for my birthday.
- Does he know about me?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.386
About us?

07:57.603 --> 08:00.219
No, my dad hasn't said a thing.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.768
What is it?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.940
Did something else happen?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.361
We just need to be
a lot more careful now.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.617
They're not gonna split us apart.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.488
Not us.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.540
You're sure no one followed you?

08:29.510 --> 08:33.674
Totally, absolutely,
100 million percent sure.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.843
My parents are out, anyways.

08:37.393 --> 08:40.226
- Out?
- Yeah, it's date night.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.567
Can I help you?

08:53.784 --> 08:56.275
Well, I hope so,
principal Thomas.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.820
As a concerned parent, uh, I was
wondering--how long has it been

08:59.999 --> 09:01.830
since your last
performance review?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.157
What?

09:09.842 --> 09:12.003
We were wondering.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.507
Are you aware there's been
an alarming drop in academic

09:19.685 --> 09:22.722
achievement and test scores
over the past few semesters?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.885
Excuse me?

09:24.064 --> 09:27.272
It's led the parents of Beacon Hills
to the unfortunate conclusion

09:27.443 --> 09:31.277
that you may no longer be suited
to the position of school principal.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.312
You can't fire me.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.991
True.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.194
But we can torture you.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.996
Derek?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.491
Derek!

09:49.173 --> 09:50.879
What's wrong?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.547
My dad.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.008
I think he's dead.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.387
What did you do?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.178
That's the thing.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.768
It wasn't me.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.314
I'm serious.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.115
It's not like the last full moon.
I don't feel the same.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.946
Oh, does that include the urge
to maim and kill people like me?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.738
I swear I don't have the urge
to maim and kill you.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.949
You know, you say that now but
then the full moon goes up

10:27.127 --> 10:29.083
and out come the fangs and the claws

10:29.254 --> 10:32.087
and there's a lot of howling and
screaming and running everywhere, okay?

10:32.257 --> 10:34.248
And it's very stressful on me and
so yes, I'm still locking you up.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.336
Okay, fine.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.628
But I do think I'm in more control now.
Especially since things are good with Allison.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.138
Okay, I'm aware of how good
things are with Allison.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.716
- They're really good.
- I--thank you, I know.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.556
I mean, like, really good.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.685
All right, I get it!

10:47.856 --> 10:50.814
Just please shut the hell up before I
have the urge to maim and kill myself.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.361
All right, did you get something
better than handcuffs this time?

10:53.529 --> 10:55.235
Yeah, much better.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.872
Part of me wants to ask.

11:12.047 --> 11:15.414
The other part says knowing
will be more disturbing than anything

11:15.592 --> 11:17.207
I could ever imagine.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.970
So...l'm gonna walk away.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.631
That's good.
That's a wise choice, coach.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.026
You okay?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.612
Scott.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.118
- There's another. In here, right now.
- Another what?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.453
Another werewolf.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.802
You really don't
remember anything?

12:02.973 --> 12:05.055
They called it a fugue state,
which is basically a way of saying

12:05.225 --> 12:07.511
"We have no idea why you
can't remember running through the woods

12:07.686 --> 12:09.187
naked for two days."

12:09.354 --> 12:11.766
But personally, I don't care.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.597
I lost nine pounds.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.859
- Are you ready for this?
- Please.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.988
It's not like my aunt's
a serial killer.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.421
Maybe it's the nine pounds.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.860
It was kind of like a scent,
but I couldn't tell who it was.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.863
What if you can get him one-on-one?
Would that help?

13:03.367 --> 13:04.356
Yeah.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.946
Okay. I think I got an idea.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.031
You need a digital camera?

13:12.209 --> 13:15.952
Yeah. And something that
can record in low light.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.832
All night long.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.206
What are you recording?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.841
Something in low light.
All night long.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.969
- Do you have the camera or not?
- You have 100 bucks?

13:26.932 --> 13:28.797
I drive a Porsche.
What do you think?

13:28.976 --> 13:32.889
- I think your parents have 100 bucks.
- Just get me the camera.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.599
I told coach you're switching
with Danny for the day.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.357
- But I hate playing goal.
- Remember when I said I had an idea?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.067
- This is the idea.
- Oh.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.697
There we go.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.482
What's the idea?

13:47.661 --> 13:51.028
I seriously don't understand
how you survive without me sometimes.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.081
Let's go! Line it up!

13:54.293 --> 13:55.908
Faster!

13:56.837 --> 13:58.953
Make daddy proud.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.423
Here we go.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.474
Let me help you up.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.477
- McCall!
- Yeah.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.228
Usually the goalie stays
somewhere within the vicinity

14:20.402 --> 14:22.142
of the actual goal.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.693
Yes, coach.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.070
Let's try it again.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.133
- What the hell, man?
- My bad, dude.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.668
McCall!

14:47.888 --> 14:50.721
The position's goal keeper.
Not goal abandoner.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.472
Sorry, coach.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.596
Let's go!

15:11.078 --> 15:14.320
Stilinski, what the hell
is wrong with your friend?

15:14.498 --> 15:17.331
Uh, he's failing two classes.
He's a little socially awkward

15:17.501 --> 15:20.413
and if you look close enough,
his jaw line's kind of uneven.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.870
That's interesting.

15:26.385 --> 15:27.625
Let's fire it up.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.141
It's Armani.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.937
My aftershave. Armani.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.233
Oh.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.816
It's nice.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.655
McCall!

15:50.826 --> 15:53.488
You come out of that goal
one more time,

15:53.662 --> 15:55.698
and you'll be doing
suicide runs till you die.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.327
It'll be the first ever suicide run
that actually ends in a suicide.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.537
- Got it?
- Yes, coach.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.547
Uh, coach, my shoulder's hurting.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna sit this one out.

17:06.485 --> 17:07.975
Don't tell them.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.489
Please don't tell them.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.742
His father's dead.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.078
They think he was murdered.

17:24.669 --> 17:25.624
Come on.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.047
Are they saying he's a suspect?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.497
I'm not sure, why?

17:30.675 --> 17:33.838
Because they can lock him in
a holding cell for 24 hours.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.595
- Like, overnight?
- During the full moon.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.512
How good are these holding cells
at holding people?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.892
People, good.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.520
Werewolves,
probably not that good.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.189
Stiles, remember when I said
I don't have the urge to maim and kill?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.475
Yeah.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.235
He does.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.488
Why would Derek choose Isaac?

17:59.663 --> 18:02.826
Peter told me that if the bite
doesn't turn you it could kill you.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.828
And maybe teenagers have a
better chance of surviving.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.958
Does being a teenager mean
your dad can't hold him?

18:08.505 --> 18:10.962
Well, not unless they
have solid evidence.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.256
Danny. Where's Jackson?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.593
- In the principal's office talking to your dad.
- What? Why?

18:21.393 --> 18:24.351
Maybe because he lives across
the street from Isaac.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.389
- Witness.
- We gotta get to the principal's office.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.771
- How?
- Everyone please turn to page 73.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.440
Who in the hell did that?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.655
Wait, so are you telling me that you
knew Isaac's father was hitting him?

18:44.833 --> 18:46.949
Hitting him? He was kicking
the crap out of him.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.493
Did you ever say
anything to anyone?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.957
A teacher, parents, anyone?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.664
Nope. It's not my problem.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.301
No, no, of course not.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.307
You know, it's funny that the
kids getting beaten up

19:01.474 --> 19:03.556
are always the ones who
least deserve it.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.263
Yeah.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.177
Wait, what?

19:07.606 --> 19:09.016
I think we're done here.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.150
Hi, Scott.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.247
Boys.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.875
Come on in.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.792
Scott McCall.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.798
Academically
not the most accomplished,

19:41.473 --> 19:45.887
but I see you have
become quite the star athlete.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.427
Mr. Stilinski.

19:50.982 --> 19:55.225
Oh, perfect grades but
little to no extracurriculars.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.611
Maybe you should try lacrosse.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.239
- Oh, actually I'm already--
- Hold on.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.191
McCall.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.237
You're the Scott that was
dating my granddaughter.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.414
We were dating but not anymore.

20:09.626 --> 20:14.165
Not dating, not seeing any of each other
or doing anything with each other... at all.

20:14.339 --> 20:19.299
Relax, Scott, you look like you're about
to crack a cyanide pill with your teeth.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.632
Just a hard breakup.

20:22.806 --> 20:26.674
Oh, that's too bad.
You seem like a pretty nice kid to me.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.805
Now listen, guys.
Yes, I am the principal,

20:29.979 --> 20:33.722
but I really don't want you
to think of me as the enemy.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.227
Is that so?

20:35.402 --> 20:39.111
However, this being my first day,
I do need to support my teachers.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.943
So unfortunately someone is
going to have to take the fall

20:43.118 --> 20:45.860
and stay behind for detention.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.918
It's just--we haven't really
talked since that night and well--

21:00.093 --> 21:03.005
Jackson, can you, like,
look at me for half Ia second?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.298
Listen if you hadn't found me and
carried me back, I could have died.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.764
So ljust... I wanted
to say thank you.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.688
Lydia, we're not
getting back together.

21:15.859 --> 21:16.644
What?

21:16.818 --> 21:19.025
And just because I kept you
from bleeding out on a field once,

21:19.195 --> 21:21.481
don't expect me to come running
every time you start screaming.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.068
- I never said--
- I'm not responsible for you.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.067
Okay?

21:27.245 --> 21:29.827
But I will give you
one piece of advice.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.699
If I were you,
I'd stay home tonight.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.376
What does that mean?

21:37.547 --> 21:39.003
What's tonight?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.257
It's a full moon.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.038
- Get in.
- Are you serious?

22:14.751 --> 22:16.616
You did that.
That's your fault.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.211
I know that.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.414
Now get in the car and help me.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.629
No, I've got a better idea.
I'm gonna call a lawyer.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.590
Because a lawyer might
actually have a chance

22:27.764 --> 22:29.254
at getting him out
before the moon goes up.

22:29.432 --> 22:32.390
- Not when they do a real search of the house.
- What do you mean?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.267
Whatever Jackson said to the cops,

22:36.189 --> 22:38.305
what's in the house is worse.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.143
A lot worse.

23:02.924 --> 23:07.213
I'm not interested in whether
they locked up a 16-year-old kid.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.504
I'm interested in what's going
to happen to that 16-year-old

23:10.682 --> 23:13.469
when the moon hits
its peak tonight.

23:14.602 --> 23:17.093
- Do we have proof?
- Is the next step killing him?

23:17.313 --> 23:20.601
The next step is
eliminating the threat.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.187
Do we have proof?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.690
I haven't been in
history class for a while,

23:26.865 --> 23:29.948
but I'm pretty sure straight-up genocide
hasn't worked out too often.

23:30.118 --> 23:33.030
- Do we have proof or not?
- Not irrefutable.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.206
But not insignificant.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.785
The driver's side door of
Lahey's car was pried off.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.169
Pried off?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.668
Ripped off.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.438
I'm starting to feel a
little weird about this.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.614
No, no, no, no.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.488
What you're feeling is $100 richer.

24:11.701 --> 24:14.443
Give me the camera and go buy
yourself another fancy lens or

24:14.621 --> 24:17.328
light meter or whatever gives
you photography geeks a hard-on.

24:17.582 --> 24:20.619
This doesn't have anything
to do with Allison, does it?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.624
I saw you two at the dance
the other night and

24:22.795 --> 24:26.037
I kind of figured that you two were,
you know, together.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.957
Aw, you have a little
thing for Allison, Matt?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.545
A IittIe--a little crush?

24:31.346 --> 24:32.335
No.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.050
You think I'm gonna waste my
time by doing something as

24:35.224 --> 24:37.761
unbelievably ordinary
as making a sex tape?

24:38.436 --> 24:40.347
Then what are you doing?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.352
Documenting history.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.690
My history.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.649
And I want to be able
to see it happening.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.033
All of it.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.033
You'll get it back tomorrow.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.719
If Isaac didn't kill
his father, who did?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.477
I don't know yet.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.724
Then how do you know
he's telling the truth?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.519
Because I trust my senses.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.900
And it's a combination of them.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.782
Not just your sense of smell.

25:41.833 --> 25:45.041
You saw the lacrosse
thing today.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.576
Yeah.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.833
Did it look that bad?

25:51.718 --> 25:52.878
Yeah.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.434
Sorry.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.099
- Allison?
- Come in. We'd like to talk to you.

26:09.277 --> 26:11.359
I'm supposed to study with Lydia,
I really don't have time to chat.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.362
Actually, that's who we want to
talk to you about, sweetheart.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.193
You wanna learn?

26:19.412 --> 26:21.027
Start now.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.835
- What's down there?
- Motive.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.416
And what am I looking for?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.926
Follow your senses.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.514
What happened down here?

26:49.734 --> 26:52.521
The kind of thing that
leaves an impression.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.728
Open it.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.965
Hey, sorry, Harris literally just
let me out of detention. Literally.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.846
And he had my phone
the whole frickin' time.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.473
Well, we need to do
something right now.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.225
They were asking me all these
questions about Lydia

28:08.396 --> 28:11.058
and how she was bitten by Peter,
and then they sent this guy out.

28:11.232 --> 28:14.520
- Wait, what guy?
- He was dressed as a Sherriff's deputy.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.525
They're sending him to
the station for Isaac.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.483
He was also carrying this box
with something on it, like, um,

28:19.699 --> 28:20.859
like a carving or something.

28:21.033 --> 28:21.988
What was it?

28:22.577 --> 28:25.364
Hold on, hold on.
It's in one of these books.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.287
I'm taking a picture.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.129
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, wolfsbane.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.423
What does that mean?

28:40.970 --> 28:42.926
It means they're gonna kill him.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.010
This is why he said yes to you.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.845
Everyone wants power.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.728
If we help you,

28:57.361 --> 28:59.226
then you have to stop.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.738
You can't just go around
turning people into werewolves.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.363
- I can if they're willing.
- Did you tell Isaac about the Argents?

29:06.537 --> 29:09.700
- About being hunted?
- Yes, and he still asked.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.455
Then he's an idiot.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.034
And you're the idiot
dating Argent's daughter.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.417
Yeah. I know you're little secret.

29:18.591 --> 29:22.425
And if I know, how long do you think
it's gonna take for them to find out?

29:23.930 --> 29:26.592
You saw what happens
to an omega.

29:30.645 --> 29:34.433
With me, you learn how to
use all of your senses.

29:35.983 --> 29:39.100
With me, you learn control.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.779
Even on a full moon.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.618
If I'm with you, I lose her.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.418
You're gonna lose her anyway.

29:58.631 --> 29:59.996
You know that.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.333
Wait.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.004
I'm not part of your pack.

30:10.393 --> 30:14.432
But I want him out.
He's my responsibility too.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.641
Why? Because he's one of us?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.358
Because he's innocent.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.827
- Hey, did you slow him down?
- You could say that.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.158
All right, well, uh, I'm headed
to the station right now.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.039
- Where's Scott?
- Isaac's.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.917
- Does he have a plan?
- Yeah, but not a very good one.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.421
And unfortunately we don't really have
time to come up with anything better.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.097
Scott?

32:41.669 --> 32:43.955
Are you sure we have to do this?

32:52.888 --> 32:54.219
Yes.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.349
Where?

33:41.103 --> 33:42.218
Please.

33:42.438 --> 33:43.974
I don't want to hurt you.

34:36.325 --> 34:38.657
Okay, now the keys to every cell

34:38.827 --> 34:41.785
are in a password protected
lockbox in my father's office.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.867
The problem is getting
past the front desk.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.282
- I'II distract her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa--you?

34:46.460 --> 34:48.121
You're not going in there.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.249
I'm taking my hand off.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.881
- l was exonerated.
- You're still a person of interest.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.418
- An innocent person.
- An--you?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.302
Yeah, right!

35:00.391 --> 35:02.382
Okay, fine. What's your plan?

35:04.353 --> 35:05.763
To distract her.

35:05.980 --> 35:08.813
Uh-huh. How?
By punching her in the face?

35:10.943 --> 35:12.183
By talking to her.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.352
Okay, all right.
Give me a sample.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.145
What are you gonna open with?

35:22.663 --> 35:24.745
Dead silence.
That should work beautifully.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.780
Any other ideas?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.785
I'm thinking about
punching you in the face.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.968
Good evening,
how can I help...

35:45.185 --> 35:46.220
you?

35:46.854 --> 35:48.264
7‘}??? f? 7,
éfégéf;

35:48.439 --> 35:50.145
Um, I had a question.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.898
Um, sorry I'm a little--
a little thrown.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.559
I wasn't really expecting someone...

35:55.738 --> 35:57.854
Like me?

35:58.032 --> 36:00.648
Oh, I was gonna say
"so incredibly beautiful" but, yeah,

36:00.826 --> 36:02.362
I guess that'd be
the same thing.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.328
It's done.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.161
- It's locked.
- Go.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.295
- Scott, I can't--
- Just go!

36:30.648 --> 36:32.138
Oh, no.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.420
Oh.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.458
Uh, just looking, um...

37:03.555 --> 37:05.091
Oh, sh--

37:57.192 --> 37:58.307
Allison!

37:58.986 --> 38:01.193
Allison! Allison!

38:59.296 --> 39:00.957
How did you do that?

39:03.258 --> 39:04.839
I'm the Alpha.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.733
Come on.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.324
Come on!

39:48.512 --> 39:50.343
What the hell was that?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.676
I don't know.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.953
Uh, he did it.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.103
No, no, no!

40:54.578 --> 40:55.943
Jackson, what is it?

40:56.121 --> 40:58.112
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.824
Nothing at all.
