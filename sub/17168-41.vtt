09:31.672 --> 09:33.772
Oh, they'll be here
in about 10 seconds.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.273
What are you talking about?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.341
I hit the lunch button.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.976
And it said 10 seconds.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.644
-"Lunch button"?
-(LAUGH TRACK)

09:39.646 --> 09:40.912
There's no lunch button.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.914
That was the launch button!

09:47.787 --> 09:50.388
-So, we're not getting lunch?
-(LAUGH TRACK)

09:50.390 --> 09:52.090
Beast Boy!

09:56.162 --> 09:57.329
(ALL GASPING)

09:57.331 --> 09:58.597
Oh!

09:59.198 --> 10:00.298
The fuel.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.833
It must have been unstable.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.769
If we had been on that
rocket, we'd all be dead.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.504
You saved us, little homie.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.173
That's how I do.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.310
(ALL CHEERING)

10:14.213 --> 10:16.848
Yes, coconut cream pie
for everyone.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.352
(SLURPS)

10:20.354 --> 10:23.555
-Hey, this is really good, yo.
-(LAUGH TRACK)

10:23.557 --> 10:24.889
Told you.
