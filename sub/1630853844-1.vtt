24:04.075 --> 24:05.200
Scellinc.

24:05.325 --> 24:06.575
Sir.

24:06.825 --> 24:07.950
How is the girl?

24:08.950 --> 24:10.950
Everything is well, sir.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.075
She sleeps soundly. Her appetite is good.
All is as it should be.

24:18.450 --> 24:19.575
And the teeth?

24:20.575 --> 24:22.200
Everything is well, sir.

24:23.825 --> 24:26.325
The month's remittance has been sent.

24:27.075 --> 24:28.700
Do you require anything else?

24:28.700 --> 24:29.950
No, sir.

24:31.825 --> 24:33.825
There will be no further payments.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.825
Sir?

24:37.825 --> 24:40.325
You must start preparing the girl to leave.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.825
Leave?

24:46.575 --> 24:52.575
You will bring her to us on
the 6th of next month, in 13 days' time.

24:55.325 --> 24:59.450
In the meantime,
you must teach her how to behave outside.

25:00.325 --> 25:01.950
Do you understand, Scellinc?

25:02.950 --> 25:04.325
Yes, sir.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.700
You must get used to being outside.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.075
Mia!

33:14.575 --> 33:15.700
Mia!

34:00.700 --> 34:01.825
Mia!

37:46.075 --> 37:47.200
Stop it!

37:57.075 --> 37:58.200
Stop!

42:40.700 --> 42:42.075
What can I get you?

42:42.075 --> 42:43.200
A Tripel.

43:30.325 --> 43:31.575
May I?

43:50.075 --> 43:51.200
I am a traveller, sir.

43:53.575 --> 43:55.200
A stranger to this city.

43:57.950 --> 43:59.075
I live far away…

44:01.450 --> 44:03.700
... in the shadow of a great cathedral.

44:13.325 --> 44:14.450
No matter.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.950
I think I shall join you.

44:42.825 --> 44:43.950
Thank you.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.950
And now, sir… What is your name?

45:11.825 --> 45:13.450
Albert Scellinc.

45:17.950 --> 45:19.075
Albert…

45:21.950 --> 45:25.700
We’ve met before...  I am sure of it.

45:28.200 --> 45:33.325
Although for the moment,
I can’t quite recall where…

45:34.950 --> 45:37.325
On the field of conflict, perhaps?

45:41.200 --> 45:45.200
Covered in mud, blood and shit.

45:54.700 --> 46:00.200
Or was it long before… at the orphanage?

46:09.825 --> 46:10.950
No…

46:12.575 --> 46:19.325
No, in fact, I believe it was after the war…
when you had a wife.

46:21.825 --> 46:23.075
Wife?

46:25.200 --> 46:28.075
Didn’t you take a wife after the war?

46:33.200 --> 46:34.575
I don’t have a wife!

46:37.075 --> 46:41.700
Marie is dead, it's true.

46:46.325 --> 46:48.075
But then there's the other one.

46:55.575 --> 46:56.950
She is waking…

47:00.200 --> 47:01.700
I don't have a wife!

47:10.700 --> 47:12.700
A child, then…

47:16.575 --> 47:18.075
... an abandoned child.

47:29.075 --> 47:30.325
It’s on the house.

47:32.575 --> 47:33.825
Thank you, Celeste.

47:44.450 --> 47:49.325
Have you never wondered what it would be like?
To be someone else?

47:52.575 --> 47:56.200
Her? For example?

47:58.325 --> 48:01.575
Please... stop!

48:06.825 --> 48:07.950
No?

48:12.950 --> 48:15.575
Then perhaps the lovely Celeste?

48:21.825 --> 48:22.950
So it’s her…

48:29.700 --> 48:30.950
I thought so.

49:48.075 --> 49:49.325
Marie...

53:56.950 --> 53:58.075
How is the girl?

53:58.825 --> 54:01.325
Everything is well, sir.

54:02.450 --> 54:05.200
She sleeps soundly… Her appetite is good…

54:26.825 --> 54:28.575
Everything is as it should be.

54:59.325 --> 55:00.825
Shhhhh…

55:03.700 --> 55:06.200
I know, I know.

55:12.325 --> 55:13.450
I’m here.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.450
Who… are… you?

55:18.700 --> 55:23.450
Shhhhh… Don’t try to talk.

55:28.700 --> 55:29.950
Go back to sleep.

55:34.825 --> 55:38.825
My name is Laurence.
I’m going to take care of everything.

55:50.450 --> 55:56.450
I want her moved to a private room.
I will cover the costs.

55:58.200 --> 56:01.450
What matters above all
is that she receives the very best care.

56:26.575 --> 56:27.700
If I might…

57:04.450 --> 57:08.700
Come on, Celeste… You need to get well.

57:32.450 --> 57:33.575
Good, good, good…

1:03:55.075 --> 1:03:57.075
You will find these satisfactory.

1:07:28.075 --> 1:07:32.700
We need your help… with the teeth.

1:07:35.325 --> 1:07:37.950
You must ask the masters for help.

1:07:39.325 --> 1:07:40.450
Masters?

1:07:43.575 --> 1:07:45.450
Yes, our masters!

1:08:11.950 --> 1:08:13.950
I have to leave soon…

1:08:17.950 --> 1:08:19.075
... on the 6th.

1:08:24.325 --> 1:08:27.200
The house has been empty since my mother died…

1:08:35.825 --> 1:08:37.575
It’s too big for one person…

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.825
The gardens will be lovely in winter.

1:08:58.575 --> 1:09:01.575
I’ll be honoured if you would agree
to come with me…

1:09:05.325 --> 1:09:06.450
... as my guest.

1:09:10.950 --> 1:09:12.575
For as long as you need.

1:09:16.825 --> 1:09:19.200
Is there really anything keeping you here?

1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:43.575
Mister Scellinc?

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.950
Have you informed our masters?

1:12:50.950 --> 1:12:54.700
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?

1:12:54.825 --> 1:12:56.075
I don't understand.

1:12:56.325 --> 1:13:00.075
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?

1:13:23.450 --> 1:13:24.700
What is the matter?

1:13:26.075 --> 1:13:27.825
Dirty sneaking bitch!

1:13:28.741 --> 1:13:30.950
- My God
- What are you doing?

1:16:23.575 --> 1:16:24.700
I will…

1:16:29.325 --> 1:16:30.700
I will go with you…

1:17:45.450 --> 1:17:47.075
Do you not recognize me?

1:17:49.825 --> 1:17:51.200
I know who you are.

1:18:35.325 --> 1:18:36.950
Go and fetch the girl.

1:19:20.575 --> 1:19:21.700
Come.

1:19:23.325 --> 1:19:24.450
Mia…

1:19:30.950 --> 1:19:32.450
Put that thing away.

1:20:05.825 --> 1:20:07.075
On the table.

1:20:11.950 --> 1:20:13.575
Lie down on the table.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.325
This will take some time.

1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:08.200
Please leave us alone.

1:21:40.575 --> 1:21:41.825
Open…

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:46.325
Wider.

1:23:29.450 --> 1:23:34.200
It’s a different system now.
The glass implants are permanent.

1:23:35.950 --> 1:23:39.950
You must attend scrupulously
to the girl’s hygiene in the days to come.

1:23:42.950 --> 1:23:45.825
Saltwater will keep her mouth free of infection.

1:23:52.450 --> 1:23:53.700
If you can manage that,

1:23:53.950 --> 1:23:57.325
there will be no need for me
to return before your departure.

1:29:17.825 --> 1:29:19.075
Not long now.

1:29:23.325 --> 1:29:24.450
It hurts.

1:29:27.575 --> 1:29:28.825
Laurence, please.

1:30:11.950 --> 1:30:16.075
I am sure that in our life together
you will no longer feel such need of it…

1:32:30.075 --> 1:32:31.575
May I help you madam?

1:36:40.575 --> 1:36:41.950
It’s on the house.

1:44:56.325 --> 1:45:00.325
I have brought the child, as I was asked.

1:45:02.450 --> 1:45:03.950
I am Albert Scellinc.

1:45:18.450 --> 1:45:20.075
Please wait in the hall.

1:46:01.575 --> 1:46:03.575
She has been well cared for.

1:46:06.450 --> 1:46:07.575
So I can see.

1:46:16.825 --> 1:46:19.450
Everything is as it should be.

1:46:22.075 --> 1:46:23.700
You mustn’t be afraid.

1:46:34.950 --> 1:46:36.075
Perfect!

1:46:37.950 --> 1:46:42.200
No doubt you have papers for me to sign.

1:46:43.325 --> 1:46:46.700
They are waiting for you at reception.

1:46:55.450 --> 1:46:57.700
Will you be leaving anything with her?

1:47:01.825 --> 1:47:05.700
Your daughter.
Will you be leaving anything with her?

1:47:05.825 --> 1:47:07.450
She is not my daughter!

1:47:08.825 --> 1:47:10.450
But you’re signing for her?

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:12.700
I am just her keeper.

1:47:17.575 --> 1:47:18.700
Look!

1:47:33.450 --> 1:47:34.575
It’s a lie!

1:49:57.825 --> 1:49:58.908
Marie?
