00:00.834 --> 00:04.138
- ( grunts )
- ( shouting )

00:06.474 --> 00:08.242
- ( cannon fire )
- ( shouting )

00:08.242 --> 00:11.612
- ( grunts )
- ( yelling )

00:16.584 --> 00:18.018
Take cover!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.620
( cannon blasts )

00:26.794 --> 00:28.896
It's quiet, sir.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.598
Almost too quiet.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.803
( phone chiming )

00:36.837 --> 00:37.905
- Oh, Devan!
- Devan!

00:37.905 --> 00:39.273
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.841
I thought
I switched it off.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.976
- ( beeps )
- Take the reenactment
seriously.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.745
- I know.
- Don't be a farb.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.514
- ( groans )
- Why did you
even bring that?

00:46.514 --> 00:47.615
In case Heidi calls.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.617
There's a sale going on
at the garden center.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.253
She's gonna call me
if the gazebos are discounted.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.255
- Got to have
a weekend, right?
- Amen, brother.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.525
I got a shed that
ain't gonna paint itself.

00:57.525 --> 01:01.295
How about you, Roach?
You got plans when this
darn war is over?

01:01.295 --> 01:02.830
Upgradin' my broadband.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.566
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.369
How about you, friend?
I said, do you got plans--

01:12.906 --> 01:14.675
( eerie voice )
The brothers are rising!

01:14.675 --> 01:20.047
The brothers are rising!
The brothers are rising!

01:20.047 --> 01:23.251
( theme music playing )

01:30.191 --> 01:32.460
- Jenkins: Oh, my.
- Baird: Hey, you need a hand?

01:32.460 --> 01:36.297
Oh, oh, yes, please.
Thank you so much.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.332
Colonel, dealing
with the outside world--

01:38.332 --> 01:41.769
slaying dragons,
that's one thing,
but supermarkets?

01:41.769 --> 01:45.206
Oh, Colonel, tell me.
Have grocery stores
always been

01:45.206 --> 01:48.609
such satanic mills
of mass consumerism?

01:48.609 --> 01:52.480
Truly, how many varieties
of peanut butter does
society need?

01:52.480 --> 01:57.618
Oh, and also
the unfathomable amount
of cards one must have--

01:57.618 --> 02:01.121
ID card, credit card,
club card, ATM card,
debit card.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.956
Is that how
we measure a man now?

02:02.956 --> 02:07.127
How many little pieces
of rectangular plastic
he can acquire?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.596
And all the people!

02:08.596 --> 02:11.199
Wait a minute,
you've never been
to a grocery store?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.700
I didn't need
to eat before.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.802
I could if I chose to,
but I didn't--

02:14.802 --> 02:16.570
it wasn't obligatory
for living.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.706
And look at this.
Look at all the--
I bought all of this.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.609
Why did I buy all of this?
Because of the adverts

02:21.609 --> 02:24.312
and the calming music
and the aisle upon aisle

02:24.312 --> 02:27.014
of shiny fruits
and vegetables and meats.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.549
Oh, Jenkins,
we've got you now.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.552
Why didn't you use
the magic door?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.754
Well, because now
that I'm aging normally,

02:33.754 --> 02:37.991
there will come a time
when I will need to retire
from the Library.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.161
When that day arrives,
I will not have access
to the door.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.764
So this was me trying on
my training wheels.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.600
Ah-ha.
And how'd that go?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.202
They fell off.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.938
Cassandra:
No, Ezekiel, no.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.906
What is wrong with agreeing
with Darrington Dare?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.509
I'm just saying,
maybe there should
only be one Librarian.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.810
- Yeah, I agree with him.
- You see?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.512
- It should be me.
- What?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.515
I only said that I disagree
and he jumped down my throat.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.684
Well, I-- why
wouldn't it be me, huh?
Why wouldn't it be me?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.853
Uh, because you're
a rootin' tootin' cowboy.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.055
I'm a rootin' tootin' cowboy
with a big-ass I.Q.!

03:08.055 --> 03:11.425
Having multiple Librarians
has saved the Library
multiple times!

03:11.425 --> 03:13.461
Whoa, what's going on?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.796
- Ezekiel and Stone:
She started it!
- He started it!

03:15.796 --> 03:17.731
Oh. This argument, still.
I don't under--

03:17.731 --> 03:20.000
listen, just for
the record, I'm going
to say something.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.402
I agree with
Miss Cillian.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.504
You're all Librarians.

03:23.504 --> 03:27.007
The last thing
we need here is
more disruption.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.244
- Ezekiel called me
a bookworm.
- You are a bookworm.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.447
- We all work in a Library.
- Guys, please!

03:33.447 --> 03:36.149
- ( groans )
- You're upsetting Jenkins.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.286
Colonel, no, no, no.
I'm not upset.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.688
It's not that.
It's this feeling
in my stomach.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.691
I don't understand.
Is it too much food
or too little food?

03:43.691 --> 03:46.193
Do I need a kitchen
or a bathroom?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.796
Uh, okay.
Question, Baird.

03:48.796 --> 03:53.166
Where do you stand
on the whole multi-Librarian
versus solo Librarian debate?

03:53.166 --> 03:56.470
Well, y'all keep this up,
I might start coming
around to solo.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.039
Both:
Yes. Me. No, me.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.608
Definitely a bathroom.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.344
Oh, I hate
this mortal coil.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.514
Guys, we are weeks away
from the Tethering Ceremony.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.616
Weeks away to figure out
which one of you

04:08.616 --> 04:10.484
will tether with me
to the Library forever.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.752
We need some resolution.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.722
- ( gasps )
- Ah, saved by the book.

04:14.722 --> 04:18.392
"Civil War Ghost Sightings
at a Civil War Reenactment."

04:18.392 --> 04:20.127
- Cool.
- No, it's not cool.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.663
The Civil War
was a bloody stain
on America's history.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.932
Oh, it's got
a little museum.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.000
A town called Feud.
Field trip.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.471
Well, I am gonna stay here
with Jenkins and do research.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.508
False alarm.
It was actually a belch.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.644
You learn something new
about yourself every day.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.580
Jenkins, fire up
the door to Feud.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.148
Oh.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.416
Cass, you sure you
don't want to come?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.952
I am sure.
Look at this smile.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.587
( laughs )

04:47.855 --> 04:50.524
Take care.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.427
Jenkins,
we need to talk.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.998
Well, isn't Feud
a conveniently
appropriate name

04:57.998 --> 04:59.266
for a Civil War town?

04:59.266 --> 05:01.802
Well, it was
actually named Fugue.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.837
They renamed it
after this famous feud

05:03.837 --> 05:07.140
between these two brothers,
Carlton and Uriah Loveday.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.243
Literally joined
opposite sides of the war
during the war.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.947
So I guess they take
the whole divided town thing
seriously around here.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.149
Oh, I think they do.
I mean, check this out.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.588
Look at this.
It's not just a line.
This is the line.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.689
Huh?

05:21.689 --> 05:25.726
North and South divide
runs right through Feud.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.495
( chuckles )
Hey, guys, check it.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.263
I'm a Confederate
Yankee. Yee-haw!

05:30.263 --> 05:32.065
Okay, look,
we are here,

05:32.065 --> 05:33.634
which means
the town is that way

05:33.634 --> 05:35.335
and the museum's
up the hill this way.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.870
Yeah, I think we should
start at the museum.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.540
- Why the museum?
- 'Cause it looks crazy.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.643
Plus, it'll have
a good gift shop.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.683
Feud's been having
reenactments for years.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.952
I wonder why the ghosts
decided to show up now.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.555
Ghosts are so clichÃ©.
Why can't it be
a time traveler

05:54.555 --> 05:56.524
or hologram or a magic
frat house prank?

05:56.524 --> 05:59.693
There's a long history
of credible ghost sightings
in the United States, okay?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.529
Hell, last year,
there were 13

06:01.529 --> 06:03.664
independently verified
hauntings in Chicago alone.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.766
The Loveday House Museum.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.435
This must be where
the brothers lived.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.069
They must have had
a pretty bad fallout,

06:09.069 --> 06:11.605
'cause they literally
split the house in two.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.015
A house divided cannot--
ooh, gift shop.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.622
Oh, what, did you finally get
your green card?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.791
It's ironic chic.
Totally hipster.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.126
Don't steal
from a museum, Jones.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.862
I'm leaving a payment, see?

06:34.862 --> 06:37.064
How very responsible
and Librarian-y of me.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.799
- Woman: If you can
all find a space...
- Baird: Guys, shh.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.569
...we will begin
the presentation for the press.

06:46.674 --> 06:52.480
My name is Janet Hedge
and I am curator and founder
of the Loveday House Museum.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.148
As I'm sure you know,
the Loveday brothers

06:55.148 --> 06:58.819
joined opposite sides
of the Civil War and became
bitter enemies.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.154
This broke the heart
of their mother Beatrice,

07:01.154 --> 07:04.792
who on her deathbed,
split the heart-shaped locket

07:04.792 --> 07:07.761
containing photographs
of both of her sons in two.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.398
She bequeathed one half
of the locket to each brother,

07:11.398 --> 07:13.667
begging them to reconcile.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.803
Sadly, this never
came to pass,

07:15.803 --> 07:18.205
as at the Battle
of Fugue Valley,

07:18.205 --> 07:21.509
the Loveday brothers
shot and killed each other.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.644
Ten years ago,
my team and I

07:23.644 --> 07:25.479
exhumed the bodies
of the brothers

07:25.479 --> 07:26.880
from the battlefield.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.517
Carlton's locket
was found with him

07:29.517 --> 07:32.553
and has been a part
of this museum ever since.

07:32.553 --> 07:37.224
Uriah's half
was never recovered...

07:37.224 --> 07:38.325
until today.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.994
( crowd gasps, applause )

07:40.994 --> 07:43.897
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am thrilled to announce

07:43.897 --> 07:47.434
that this week
we found the other half
of the Loveday locket.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.538
And to celebrate,

07:50.538 --> 07:53.473
we will be reuniting
both halves of the locket

07:53.473 --> 07:56.076
at a special ceremony
to kick off this year's

07:56.076 --> 07:58.746
Feud reenactment festival.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.151
Stone, you were wondering
why ghosts started showing up?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.154
I bet it has to do
with the other half of that
locket getting found.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.223
The lockets are giving off
crazy strong signals.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.160
It's definitely
the artifact.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.463
Now, are there
any questions?

08:16.463 --> 08:17.898
If they unearthed
that locket

08:17.898 --> 08:19.767
and they got
one ghost already,

08:19.767 --> 08:22.002
what do you think's
gonna happen if they
put 'em back together?

08:22.002 --> 08:25.673
( ghostly whooshing )

08:30.443 --> 08:32.212
Janet:
Everyone likes
to be a part of history.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.982
And when the two halves
of the locket are reunited,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.216
it will be historic.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.286
And please quote me
with that exact wording.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.921
Who's next?

08:40.921 --> 08:45.092
Eve Baird, the "Annex News
Network Online."

08:45.092 --> 08:46.960
Oh, yes, I haven't
heard of you before.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.796
How did you find
the other half of the locket?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.464
By chance
at a recent dig

08:51.464 --> 08:53.266
at the Fugue Valley
Battle site.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.568
Just luck?
That's it?

08:54.568 --> 08:57.070
I wish I could claim
a greater skill,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.606
but, yes, just lucky.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.907
Convenient timing.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.909
Like I said,
it was luck.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.010
Next.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.212
Ezekiel Jones,
"Annex Advertiser."

09:05.212 --> 09:07.815
Can you comment
on the recent ghost
sightings in town?

09:07.815 --> 09:10.417
Well, yes.
Obviously they're not true,

09:10.417 --> 09:14.788
but any story
that promotes the legend
of the Loveday brothers is--

09:14.788 --> 09:16.690
Sells more tickets
to the festival.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.425
No, I was going to say,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.994
"Puts more focus
on the issues."

09:20.994 --> 09:26.199
- Yes, Mister--
- Uh, Stone. Jacob Stone.
"The New Annexian."

09:26.199 --> 09:30.904
What can you tell us
about the line that runs
directly through town?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.640
The dividing line
has been here

09:32.640 --> 09:34.675
for as long as
the reenactment
festival has.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.044
It is now a part
of this town's history.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.447
So, it's a fake part
of this town's history,
would you say?

09:40.447 --> 09:42.082
Fake is
a very strong word.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.985
Yeah, well, you can't
just reinvent the past

09:44.985 --> 09:47.020
to suit ourselves
in the present, can you?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.156
It's a metaphor
for a nation divided.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.791
And that's enough
questions, I think,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.826
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.970
Okay, so there's
no ley lines around here,

10:02.970 --> 10:04.938
so what would make
two ordinary locket halves

10:04.938 --> 10:06.506
turn into
two magical locket halves?

10:06.506 --> 10:08.208
I have a theory.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.044
This whole town
is based on the legend
of the Loveday brothers

10:11.044 --> 10:13.080
and their mutual hatred
for one another.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.683
The town even changed
their name because of them.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.685
This locket is a symbol
of their story.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.086
Well, symbols
grow in power

10:19.086 --> 10:21.521
because of the meaning
people attach to them,

10:21.521 --> 10:23.090
just like
a religious artifact.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.158
Yeah, except
this artifact is fueled

10:25.158 --> 10:27.394
by the hate and anger
of these two brothers

10:27.394 --> 10:28.595
who never want
to be reunited.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.864
So, reunite the two halves
of this locket

10:30.864 --> 10:33.433
against the brothers' wishes
and what'll happen?

10:33.433 --> 10:34.968
I tell you,
it's bad stuff.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.005
Well, we better figure it out
and fast, before tomorrow.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.740
Or I could just steal it.
Just saying.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.108
Take it down
a notch, Jones.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.710
We'll use
the power of words.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.744
We'll talk
to the curator.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.779
Suit yourself.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.350
Guys, why'd you
lock me out?

10:50.350 --> 10:53.553
- Hey! Jones!
- Guys?

10:53.553 --> 10:55.823
- ( Ezekiel knocking )
- Guys?

10:59.126 --> 11:02.329
They won't open.
I can't open them.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.110
( eerie voice )
The brothers are rising.

11:17.110 --> 11:22.282
The brothers
are rising for you.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.197
You were gonna kill
each other.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.833
Well, we wouldn't
have done that.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.871
Ha-ha-ha,
very funny, Stone.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.605
We had nothing
to do with that.

11:45.605 --> 11:49.476
Oh, yeah, really?
What was it then?
A ghost?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.983
Go on, admit it.

11:55.983 --> 12:00.020
This is almost worth
becoming mortal for.

12:00.020 --> 12:00.854
Hmm.

12:00.854 --> 12:05.058
High tea
in the Annex.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.726
( giggles )

12:06.726 --> 12:08.628
The others can never
know about it.

12:08.628 --> 12:12.399
What happens at high tea
in the Annex...

12:12.399 --> 12:15.435
Stays in the Annex
at high tea.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.736
Exactly.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.542
So now that I have you here,

12:22.542 --> 12:24.277
Darrington Dare's problem with
there being only one Librarian

12:24.277 --> 12:25.745
had to do with
the Westphalian brothers

12:25.745 --> 12:27.714
who had that falling out
in the 5th Century.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.884
But I was thinking,
what do we really know
about them other than that?

12:30.884 --> 12:33.053
I mean,
if we could find out
the whole truth

12:33.053 --> 12:34.254
and then prove that
we would never make

12:34.254 --> 12:35.989
the same mistakes
that they did,

12:35.989 --> 12:38.358
I mean, maybe we could get
the others to come around.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.594
You do know that we archive

12:41.594 --> 12:46.900
the personal possessions
of all previous Librarians.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.902
I mean,
you know, if they,

12:48.902 --> 12:50.670
well, corresponded
with each other...

12:50.670 --> 12:52.705
- Their letters. Yes.
- Yeah. Yes.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.108
Hmm, as soon
as we finish high tea,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.776
we're going to the archives.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.745
Mmm, mmm.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.281
- ( knock on door )
- Come in.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.485
Oh, it's you.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.954
I assumed you worked as a pack

13:06.954 --> 13:08.822
based on your combative line
of questioning.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.657
Well, I'm with
the "Annex Advertiser,"

13:10.657 --> 13:13.393
so it's my job to ask
the tough questions.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.929
I'm with the "Annex Advertiser."
You're with the "New Annexian."

13:15.929 --> 13:18.698
Miss Hedge, we know
the Reenactment Festival

13:18.698 --> 13:20.100
is very close
to your heart.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.902
It's the center of my heart.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.170
I'm the one who founded it.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.072
I'm the one who exhumed
the brothers.

13:25.072 --> 13:28.375
I'm the one who dedicated
decades of her life
telling their story.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.743
And you're the one
that painted the line
down the center of town?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.512
Ugh, that line again.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.814
Let it go.
It's a metaphor.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.484
Do you think Disneyland
employs real giant mice?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.086
Disneyland is a theme park.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.155
History is a theme park,
if you package it right.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.790
You see, now this
is where me and you

13:43.790 --> 13:45.325
are going to have
a lot of disagreements.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.561
If I could just bring
the conversation back around,

13:48.561 --> 13:50.363
we just saw a ghost.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.831
What? Where?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.034
Right out there, just now.
A widow in black.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.568
That's two ghost sightings
in two days.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.204
Both since you found
the second half of that locket.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.771
What do you think
is gonna happen

13:58.771 --> 14:00.373
when you put the
two halves back together?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.374
Nothing.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.177
Because there's
no such thing as ghosts.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.047
Um, we're kind of experts
in this sort of field.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.316
So if you don't mind us taking
one look at that locket,

14:09.316 --> 14:10.383
it would really--

14:10.383 --> 14:12.819
That locket
is my star attraction.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.255
Visitors' numbers are down.
Receipts are down.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.058
That locket is
what's bringing everyone
back to Feud.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.960
Miss Hedge,
you can't move forward
with the festival.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.528
People could get hurt.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.729
The Reenactment Festival

14:22.729 --> 14:24.264
is what keeps
this town afloat.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.233
Do you know
what this place was

14:26.233 --> 14:29.002
before I brought
the Loveday brothers'
story back to life?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.171
A dead and dying ghost town,

14:31.171 --> 14:32.772
and that's the only ghost
I'm worried about--

14:32.772 --> 14:34.908
the ghost of this town
in economic ruin.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.876
Now, please leave.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.980
Get out. Thank you.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.117
It all boils down to money.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.386
You're right, Stone.
It is turning into
a theme park.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.655
- History?
- War.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.190
I've lived it. Real war.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.959
And it's not a game.
It's not fun.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.326
It is not a festival.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.964
Turning war
into a family day out--

14:56.964 --> 14:59.066
I hope nobody does that
to any battle I was in.

15:00.767 --> 15:05.072
( device beeping )

15:12.045 --> 15:16.416
You wanna know the truth?
Meet me in one hour.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.590
( ghostly children's
laughter )

15:27.527 --> 15:29.862
See? I told you
there were ghosts here.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.198
Yeah, it was totally creepy.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.966
This little golem
leprechaun thing

15:32.966 --> 15:34.867
was ringing its bell,
being all short and spooky.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.369
You have a better
description than that?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.205
Short and spooky.
I hate ghosts.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.707
"Make Love Not Shawarma."

15:40.707 --> 15:42.475
( laughs )

15:42.475 --> 15:44.711
Hmm, shawarma, though.
Kind of risky for the South.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.313
According to
their Facebook page,

15:46.313 --> 15:49.049
they have a truck set up on
the west side of the field.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.883
- Over there.
- Hey.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.252
Those three guys,

15:52.252 --> 15:53.686
those are the guys
from the Clipping Book,

15:53.686 --> 15:54.988
the first ones
to see the ghost.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.424
Okay, you two talk
to Secret Shawarma.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.159
I'll go talk to these guys.
I speak soldier.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.328
They're fake soldiers.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.264
Okay, then I'll speak
fake soldier.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.300
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.469
Hey there,
I'm Colonel Baird, NATO.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.871
Cool. I'm pretending
to be a corporal.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.974
No, I am an actual colonel,
so 'tention!

16:16.776 --> 16:18.711
What's an actual colonel
doing here?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.148
No, you say,
"Permission to speak, ma'am."
Then you ask the question.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.150
Guys, I'm just messing
with you. At ease.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.784
I was wondering though,
could I ask you

16:24.784 --> 16:27.154
a few questions
about a ghost?

16:29.756 --> 16:31.191
- Hello.
- Great.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.892
Came here just like you said.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.461
I'm the guy you gave
the card to--

16:35.862 --> 16:37.497
Man:
Around here.
Before they see you.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.270
Hello?

16:43.270 --> 16:46.439
Hey, before who sees us?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.213
Hey, who's that?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.681
Don't worry. It's safe.
He's a friend.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.116
Well, sometimes.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.584
Sometimes safe
or sometimes a friend?

16:57.584 --> 17:00.387
Just answer the question.
Before who sees us?

17:00.387 --> 17:03.490
The eyes in the skies.
The satellites.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.924
The government's watching
everything I do.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.094
Ezekiel:
I knew it.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.995
Hey, I heard about you
from the press conference.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.063
You're asking
the right questions.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.964
Why ghosts? Why here?

17:11.964 --> 17:12.999
Why now?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.334
I'll tell you why.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.269
'Cause they're not ghosts.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.839
- What are they?
- Robots.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.875
Built by the government using
tech salvaged from Area 52.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
Area 52?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.478
Yeah, Area 52.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.046
You know,
big brother to Area 51,

17:27.046 --> 17:28.681
except it's even more secret.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.284
The whole ghost thing's
just a smoke screen.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.819
Government's using
alien robots

17:32.819 --> 17:34.053
to hide the truth.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.488
What truth?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.557
That the government's
using alien robots.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.294
And they're in league
with the damn Yankees.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.430
- Why?
- 'Cause the Yankees

17:43.430 --> 17:45.465
and the government,
they all work for the Man.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.968
See, they're not
clear-thinking rebels.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.303
Like us.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.208
It's actually safe
to be seen in public again.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.876
Satellites move on
about every half hour.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.812
I see your paranoia runs on
a tight schedule as well.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.714
- Thank you.
- Jones.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.451
Jones.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.885
Left, left!

18:05.885 --> 18:07.354
Devan:
See, I didn't believe in it

18:07.354 --> 18:09.622
until I saw a ghost
with my own eyes.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.492
But you gotta ask yourself,
who stands to gain

18:12.492 --> 18:14.394
from summoning up
dead spirits?

18:14.394 --> 18:17.330
Our theory is
the Confederate re-enactors

18:17.330 --> 18:19.065
are trying to change
the results.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.201
We Yankees, we won
the Battle of Fugue Valley.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.303
But scare all the Yankees away,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.572
they rewrite history, they win.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.974
The pretend Confederates
win the reenactment.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.476
History stays the same.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.944
History is the story you tell.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.813
The Confederates win
the reenactment,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.715
the Confederates win history.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.384
Don't look now.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.687
Here comes
Captain Conspiracy Theory.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.390
He also plays one
of the Confederate officers.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.658
Plus does the catering.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.227
Well, well, well,

18:47.227 --> 18:48.995
if it isn't
the Yankee boys.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.898
Troy, Roach.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.066
- Devan.
- Griz.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.237
You been abducted
by any UFOs lately?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.339
I'm sensing
some animosity here.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.140
Yeah, we went
to high school together.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.343
Griz and I are old rivals.
Aren't we?

19:03.343 --> 19:07.714
Debate team, soccer team,
jazz improv team.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.183
The point is Griz here
has a nasty habit

19:10.183 --> 19:12.018
of always choosing
the losing side.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.286
Oh, is that so?

19:13.286 --> 19:15.255
'Cause the way I hear it,
you Yankee boys

19:15.255 --> 19:17.257
are about ready
to skedaddle on out of here

19:17.257 --> 19:21.428
'cause of some scary,
scary ghosts.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.196
Y'all realize
the Yankees go runnin',

19:23.196 --> 19:24.664
Confederates win this battle.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.798
( scoffs )

19:25.798 --> 19:28.835
So fake Confederates
fake win a fake battle.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.069
It's all the same thing.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.304
Shoot.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.172
Vouchers for free shawarma.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.707
You're welcome.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.276
He seems fun.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.479
Guys, have any of you seen
the ghost of a widow?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.748
No, ma'am, just the soldier
we told you about,

19:41.748 --> 19:45.385
the fellow who said,
"The brothers are rising."

19:45.385 --> 19:46.686
Wait, this widow,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.655
did she wear a pendant?
Like a black rose?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.989
Yes, how'd you know?

19:49.989 --> 19:53.226
Well, there's a display
about her back at the museum.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.963
That's Diana Loveday,
Carlton Loveday's widow.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.733
- ( Jenkins laughs )
- ( chuckles )

20:00.733 --> 20:03.903
From the Archives
of the Librarians.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.705
In every box, a life lived.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.674
Is my whole life
going to go in a box?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.309
Please, just not
my teenage diaries.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.144
Everyone is allowed at least
one misguided Goth phase

20:12.144 --> 20:14.247
that... no one else
can know about.

20:14.247 --> 20:18.985
Indeed. Ah, Darrington Dare.
Huh? Oh, and his Banshee.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.453
( chuckles )

20:22.154 --> 20:23.756
Oh, I don't mean
to bash the system,

20:23.756 --> 20:25.692
but these are hardly
in alphabetical order.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.460
No, they're not.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.396
The Librarian who first
established the Archive,

20:29.396 --> 20:31.564
Zelpha The Forgetful,

20:31.564 --> 20:34.601
rather eccentric
in her working habits.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.903
Ha! Ta-da.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.405
- Yes.
- ( chuckles )

20:38.405 --> 20:41.808
The brothers of
Westphalia's correspondence.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.643
And they're missing.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.079
Ah, Zelpha.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.115
She must have taken them,

20:49.115 --> 20:51.284
left a note
where she put them.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.653
"LÃ­ Ban, Acionna, ubiquitous."

20:53.653 --> 20:55.254
- What's that mean?
- Don't know.

20:55.254 --> 20:59.659
Her aide-memoires--
impossible to decipher.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.394
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.762
We can figure this out.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.165
Um, well, "ubiquitous"
means "everywhere."

21:06.165 --> 21:09.569
- Yes.
- Uh, "LÃ­ Ban, Acionna."

21:09.569 --> 21:12.305
Those are Celtic names,
I believe, yes.

21:12.305 --> 21:16.409
If only we were near
or in some place

21:16.409 --> 21:18.378
that had lots
and lots of books.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.880
- ( chuckles )
- To the Celtic section!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.281
- Ah! Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.984
Let's see what we can find.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.090
Hey, it's her.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.425
Diana Loveday.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.226
"Diana Loveday, beloved bride

21:34.226 --> 21:35.362
of General Carlton Loveday."

21:35.362 --> 21:36.363
That's this guy right here.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.498
He was a Confederate.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.066
"Little is known
about the mysterious Diana

21:40.066 --> 21:42.369
other than that she and Carlton
were deeply in love.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.303
Diana outlived her husband
by many years.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.339
This is the only known
photograph of her."

21:46.339 --> 21:48.575
It's sun-damaged.
You can't really see her face.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.510
But look-- same brooch.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.712
The golem leprechaun
with the bell!

21:52.712 --> 21:54.814
It's not
a golem leprechaun!

21:55.882 --> 21:57.984
It was a kid.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.118
Milton Loveday.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.787
He was Uriah Loveday's son.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.922
That's his brother.
That's Uriah Loveday
right there.

22:02.922 --> 22:03.990
He was a Yankee.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.091
"Milton Loveday
was 12 years old

22:05.091 --> 22:06.926
during the Battle
of Fugue Valley.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.096
He'd lost something
precious to him--
a gift from his father.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.932
He was looking for it
when he was killed
in the crossfire."

22:12.932 --> 22:15.535
He used to ring the bell
when it was time for church.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.437
That was the bell
that I heard.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.807
He must've died
with it in his hand.

22:20.807 --> 22:24.276
- ( ghostly whispers )
- ( bell ringing )

22:24.276 --> 22:26.245
It's him again--
Milton.

22:26.245 --> 22:30.517
( ringing continues )

22:34.320 --> 22:38.458
- ( thumping )
- ( ringing continues )

22:44.363 --> 22:47.567
I didn't mean to lose it.
I'm sorry, Daddy.

22:52.472 --> 22:56.809
I didn't mean to lose it.
I'm sorry, Daddy.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.411
Lose what, Milton?

22:58.411 --> 23:01.380
I didn't mean to lose it.
I'm sorry, Daddy.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.050
Tell us what you lost.
We could help you find it.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.018
( rumbling )

23:06.018 --> 23:08.220
You guys hear that?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.322
Is that thunder?

23:10.322 --> 23:12.625
That's not thunder.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.060
That's boots on the ground.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.466
( soldiers chanting )
The brothers are rising.

23:19.466 --> 23:23.703
The brothers are rising.
The brothers are rising.

23:23.703 --> 23:27.540
I'm sorry, but tomorrow
the brothers are rising.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.410
The brothers are rising.
The brothers are rising.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.216
New plan.
Back to Ezekiel's old plan.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.251
We steal both sides
of the locket

23:39.251 --> 23:40.386
and get them out of here
before tomorrow.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.588
Lovely.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.324
Janet:
The museum closes in--

23:45.324 --> 23:47.760
Oh! You again.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.428
Yeah, I didn't touch it or--

23:49.428 --> 23:51.464
Were you standing
outside just now?

23:51.464 --> 23:53.633
No, I was closing up
the gift shop.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.735
And you didn't see a platoon

23:55.735 --> 23:58.304
of ghost solders just walk
through these walls?

23:58.304 --> 24:01.307
No. Should I have?

24:01.307 --> 24:03.510
I find it strange
that you didn't.

24:03.510 --> 24:06.646
Or it's strange that you did.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.783
Come on, guys.
I think it's time we got going.

24:19.692 --> 24:24.263
LÃ­ Ban and Acionna
were Celtic water goddesses.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.432
LÃ­ Ban, Acionna,
ubiquitous.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.701
water, water, everywhere--

24:28.701 --> 24:31.538
that's a quotation from, uh,
"The Ancient Mariner."

24:31.538 --> 24:34.273
And I believe that I have--

24:34.273 --> 24:36.475
Yes! We have a first edition

24:36.475 --> 24:37.744
of said book.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.246
Oh! Ah-ha!
Another note.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.249
Oh. "The throne
of the sun, the boar,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.785
and the ship's wheel
at 11:00 p.m."

24:45.785 --> 24:48.154
Jeez, Zelpha, couldn't you
just use Dewey Decimal?

24:54.293 --> 24:56.162
Stone:
What about the motion sensors?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.531
( beeping )

24:59.999 --> 25:01.133
( beeps )

25:01.133 --> 25:02.969
You see?
You would be lost

25:02.969 --> 25:04.537
without me in these kind
of situations.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.739
And yet I would
not be lost without yours.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.875
There's plenty of situations
where I'd have the upper hand.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.644
- Name three.
- Anything outdoorsy. Huh?

25:11.644 --> 25:13.079
Anything fist-fighty.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.381
Anything that deals with
medieval Spanish love poetry.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.483
Oh! Because
we're always coming up
against life or death

25:17.483 --> 25:19.518
Spanish medieval
love poetry situations.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.188
Girls, quit it.
You're both pretty.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.323
I am so much prettier--

25:24.323 --> 25:26.392
Okay. Let's just say
you had to tether

25:26.392 --> 25:28.861
one of us to the Library,
which you do,

25:28.861 --> 25:30.697
- which one of us do you pick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.264
I'm not answering that.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.633
Baird, you said it yourself.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.501
The Tethering Ceremony
is weeks away. Okay?

25:35.501 --> 25:37.036
You gotta pick somebody.
Is it gonna be me

25:37.036 --> 25:38.671
or is it gonna be him?

25:38.671 --> 25:41.808
Well, what makes you think
I wouldn't pick Cassandra?

25:41.808 --> 25:43.810
- ( gasps ) Cassandra?
- I'm being serious here.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.678
- I'm-- I'm prettier.
- Who's gonna do
the heavy lifting?

25:45.678 --> 25:46.713
Ezekiel:
Jones is going to do
the heavy lifting?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.981
Guys, the lockets aren't here.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.017
I noticed she had
a safe in her office.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.785
Maybe she's keeping it
there overnight. Stone!

25:52.785 --> 25:54.987
Since you're so amazingly
brilliant at everything,

25:54.987 --> 25:56.956
why don't you
go crack open the safe?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.825
You want me
to crack open the safe?
I guarantee you I can.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.526
- If you can do it,
then I can probably--
- Puh-lease!

26:00.526 --> 26:02.561
Crack open a safe?
You couldn't crack open an egg.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.264
I'll crack open your head.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.800
Oh, too easy.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.802
It's a Hewlett-Taylor-Cooper
Safematic Mark Four.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.738
These things practically
crack themselves.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.940
Gotta admit,
boy's got skills.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.041
I got skills.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.242
And a moral code.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.509
Are you implying I don't?

26:17.509 --> 26:19.245
You're-- You're a thief.
Of course you don't.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.114
Uh-huh. I like to think
I have my own moral code.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.250
- Which is?
- A work in progress.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.718
Stone's got a point.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.820
Being a Librarian is more than
just about what's in here.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.821
It's about what's in here.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.256
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.693
Now, how about what's in here?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.461
That's weird.
There's no locket halves.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.796
Just a bunch of old photos.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.631
Why would you keep
old photos in a safe?

26:38.631 --> 26:39.966
Let me see these.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.036
Who's...

26:44.036 --> 26:47.506
Must be a picture of when she
found the brothers' bodies.

26:47.506 --> 26:48.841
Dated ten years ago?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.743
These look just like
the photos from the museum.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.211
Why hide these away?

26:52.211 --> 26:53.746
I don't trust this woman.

26:53.746 --> 26:54.981
Miss Janet Hedge

26:54.981 --> 26:56.683
seems to be behind everything

26:56.683 --> 26:59.551
that's going on in this town.
What is--

26:59.551 --> 27:01.620
That's a picture
of Diana Loveday.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.556
There's more detail
in this original photo.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.358
I've got just the thing.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.895
Borrowed some super-secret
government software.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.797
It's a facial
reconstruction program.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.432
How long does that take?

27:13.432 --> 27:14.867
There's not much to go on,

27:14.867 --> 27:16.268
so it's just under nine hours.

27:16.268 --> 27:20.206
Oh, nice try.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.675
Trying to steal
the Loveday locket, are you?

27:22.675 --> 27:24.210
Well, bad luck.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.479
The locket is in a safe
and secret location tonight.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.215
I know how this must look.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.751
It looks like you're trying
to sabotage my festival,

27:31.751 --> 27:34.921
and we don't take kindly
to saboteurs in my town.

27:34.921 --> 27:37.589
And let me make something
very clear.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.491
- This is my town.
- ( siren wailing )

27:39.491 --> 27:41.728
( siren chirps )

27:47.133 --> 27:48.634
Man:
When are they
going to set bail?

27:48.634 --> 27:50.602
Man 2:
Not till after the ceremony.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.904
Man:
The locket ceremony?

27:51.904 --> 27:53.272
Man 2: Yeah,
that's what they told me.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.607
Guys, guys.
I just heard the cops talking.

27:55.607 --> 27:56.809
They're not gonna set
our bail

27:56.809 --> 27:58.010
until after
the locket ceremony,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.746
which means we need
to break out now

27:59.746 --> 28:01.580
if we're gonna stop it.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.851
- Ezekiel, do something--
- They took
my Game Boy off me!

28:04.851 --> 28:06.118
- What?
- What?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.154
That's where I keep
all my lockpicks.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.989
That's a seriously
old-fashioned door.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.525
You would need
some kind of strong metal pin
to unlock it.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.227
I got nothing. Sorry.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.630
Me neither.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.566
But I can get you one.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.835
Right. Get me one how?

28:22.835 --> 28:24.804
Well, you see, my skillset

28:24.804 --> 28:26.438
allows me to see
that this place

28:26.438 --> 28:29.608
was built... 1930s.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.111
Which means...

28:32.111 --> 28:34.713
the original ceiling's
been lowered.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.185
Probably around 1970.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.987
And given
the light construction

28:40.987 --> 28:43.489
and the building codes
of that time,

28:43.489 --> 28:45.124
this place
was held together...

28:47.559 --> 28:48.995
with metal pins.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.764
Come on. Give it.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.965
- Here, take it.
- Give it.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.767
- Here.
- Give it.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.971
A little history lesson
for you. You're welcome.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.506
( mocking )
"A little history
lesson for you."

29:00.506 --> 29:01.874
Thank you.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.444
- Wakey-wakey.
- Oh.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.279
Come on, Jenkins.
Up and at 'em.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.414
Thinking caps on.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.849
I refuse to lose

29:09.849 --> 29:12.551
a treasure hunt
to Zelpha The Infuriating.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.321
The Forgetful.
But I take your point.

29:17.523 --> 29:22.862
Miss Cillian,
not long ago it seems you
agreed with Mr. Dare

29:22.862 --> 29:24.530
that there should be
only one Librarian,

29:24.530 --> 29:27.399
and now it seems you're
proactively opposed
to the idea.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.102
May I ask why?

29:31.437 --> 29:33.739
I love being a Librarian.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.408
I want to continue to be
a Librarian,

29:36.408 --> 29:38.644
and if there's only one...

29:38.644 --> 29:39.946
you know
those kids in school

29:39.946 --> 29:41.513
who never got picked
for sports teams?

29:41.513 --> 29:43.315
That was me.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.752
So I just worry that
if there's only one position,

29:46.752 --> 29:49.121
that I'm not
going to make the cut.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.091
But if we keep
the team together,
then I'm in.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.164
When I say it out loud,
it sounds selfish.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.799
Well, if that's the case,
then I'm being selfish, too,

30:00.799 --> 30:03.035
because quite frankly...

30:06.038 --> 30:08.407
I like having
all of you around.

30:10.076 --> 30:11.543
"The throne of the sun,

30:11.543 --> 30:14.380
the boar,
and the ship's wheel

30:14.380 --> 30:16.148
at 11:00 p.m."

30:16.148 --> 30:19.751
Could it be
referencing heraldry?

30:19.751 --> 30:21.053
It could be.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.523
A flag with a sun, a boar,

30:24.523 --> 30:27.026
and a ship's wheel.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.896
Wait a minute. It's--

30:29.896 --> 30:31.964
It's the the Coat
of Arms for Pure

30:31.964 --> 30:33.632
in Ardennes
northern France.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.602
Pure-- what's
the rest of the clue?

30:36.602 --> 30:38.337
At 11:00 p.m.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.872
11:00 p.m., night.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.574
Pure... night-- oh!

30:42.574 --> 30:44.843
Oh, Galahad, that--

30:44.843 --> 30:47.046
it's you.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.049
Galahad's throne?
I've never had a throne.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.519
But you do now.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.587
It's your desk.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.556
My desk.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.325
But-- well, no, really.

30:59.325 --> 31:03.295
I mean, I think that
I would remember if somebo--

31:03.295 --> 31:04.863
Jenkins.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.167
Shrove Tuesday, 1782,

31:08.167 --> 31:13.973
Zelpha gave me
a stack of letters

31:13.973 --> 31:17.576
to keep from--

31:17.576 --> 31:18.744
My apologies.

31:18.744 --> 31:22.481
They have been literally
under my nose.

31:22.481 --> 31:27.253
Well, I guess now we can
find out the truth.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.224
( marching band playing )

31:39.331 --> 31:41.233
Good luck in the battle,
Yankee.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.635
We don't need luck, Griz.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.571
The outcome's already decided.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.605
Oh, is it?

31:54.813 --> 31:56.682
Thank you, Abe.
I'll take it from here.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.551
Is this on?
Yes, it's on.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.320
Hello, everybody!

32:01.320 --> 32:05.791
And welcome
to the tenth annual
Feud Reenactment Festival.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.694
Not only are
we celebrating history today,

32:08.694 --> 32:10.129
we are making it.

32:10.129 --> 32:14.266
Today, for the first time
in over 150 years,

32:14.266 --> 32:17.069
the two halves
of the Loveday Locket

32:17.069 --> 32:19.238
will be reunited.

32:19.238 --> 32:22.941
And who better to help perform
this historic task

32:22.941 --> 32:24.810
are the brothers themselves--

32:24.810 --> 32:28.280
Uriah and Carlton Loveday.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.583
- ( cheering )
- Thank you, Abe.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.893
- ( rumbling )
- History has been made.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.329
- ( rumbling continues )
- ( cheering )

32:43.329 --> 32:46.365
We're too late.
She's already done it.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.867
( murmuring )

32:48.867 --> 32:52.138
Wow. Tough crowd.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.474
I think we're losing them.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.376
Oh, good God. Ghosts!

32:59.045 --> 33:00.679
Wait, wait.
She's not in on this?

33:00.679 --> 33:03.482
Detail, attention!

33:03.482 --> 33:07.519
Company to the ready!

33:07.519 --> 33:09.221
Janet, look what
you're doing to the town!

33:09.221 --> 33:11.357
You have to break the locket!

33:12.491 --> 33:13.792
It won't break.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.262
- Company!
- March!

33:16.262 --> 33:18.097
- Forward march!
- ( woman screams )

33:18.097 --> 33:19.765
- March!
- ( crowd gasping )

33:19.765 --> 33:22.434
Atten-hut!

33:26.472 --> 33:29.141
The ghosts are possessing
the townspeople.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, these fake re-enactors
aren't so fake anymore.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.889
- I'm gonna break the locket.
- No, I'm gonna
break the locket.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.324
Boy, I am sick and tired
of you.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.359
Ever since school,
undermining me,

33:47.359 --> 33:49.027
mocking me,
stealing my boyfriends.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.598
Greg and Brandon loved me,
and you know it!

33:52.598 --> 33:53.799
You Yankee blowhard.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.067
Confederate scum.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.403
Griz, Devan,
pull it together.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.139
The Loveday brothers
are trying to restart
the Civil War.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.740
Janet, give me the locket!

34:01.740 --> 34:04.143
No, no, no, no.
I've got a stronger grip
than you.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.078
Yeah, well, I've got the hands
of a brain surgeon.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.813
( grunting )

34:07.813 --> 34:09.515
This is not
one of your little
techno gizmos!

34:09.515 --> 34:12.851
It's not one of your
Spanish medieval love poems!

34:12.851 --> 34:14.086
Baird:
No, guys, fight it!

34:14.086 --> 34:15.954
Don't let them take you, too!

34:15.954 --> 34:18.524
No! Come on, break.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.192
Come on!

34:23.895 --> 34:25.897
Guys, are you... you?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.234
What's wrong with
a Spanish love poem?

34:28.234 --> 34:30.369
What's wrong
with techno gizmos?

34:30.369 --> 34:32.238
No! No!

34:35.174 --> 34:36.708
Baird:
Nothing's happened.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.610
Man: Ready!

34:38.610 --> 34:40.512
Aim!

34:40.512 --> 34:41.513
Fire!

34:41.513 --> 34:44.116
( guns firing )

34:49.555 --> 34:50.656
Everybody missed.

34:52.057 --> 34:53.492
I couldn't do it, brother.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.461
Me neither.

34:55.461 --> 34:56.495
I never could.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.330
You're possessed
by the Loveday brothers.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.066
You command their troops.

35:01.066 --> 35:03.969
When you missed,

35:03.969 --> 35:05.504
everybody missed.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.441
Company!

35:09.441 --> 35:11.443
Dismissed!

35:13.779 --> 35:17.015
Man:
Company, fall in!
Forward, march!

35:17.015 --> 35:21.253
Man:
Company, fall in!
Forward, march!

35:23.289 --> 35:25.624
Um, why are they still here?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.993
It is time you learned
the truth.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.795
Bring her.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.864
( laughs )

35:33.899 --> 35:36.568
( footsteps approaching )

35:41.106 --> 35:42.808
Oh, the photo.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.643
That's private property.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.581
Jones, magnifying glass?

35:52.418 --> 35:55.754
The locket-- they died
with it in one piece,

35:55.754 --> 36:00.559
which means you chose
Stone and Jones for a reason.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.028
You knew they would put
their guns down,

36:03.028 --> 36:04.663
just like you did.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.166
( soldiers shouting )

36:18.844 --> 36:22.881
( muted shouting )

36:30.121 --> 36:32.624
Baird:
In the end, you couldn't kill
your brother.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.463
You forgot about war.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.468
But war didn't forget
about you.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.208
( explosion )

37:07.326 --> 37:09.995
You changed the end
of the story, didn't you?

37:09.995 --> 37:12.364
You found the brothers with
the locket put back together.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.632
Tell the truth, Janet.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.067
I had to keep your feud going.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.470
No feud,
meant no Feud museum,

37:18.470 --> 37:20.372
meant the end
of my lovely town.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.107
And visitor numbers
were dropping.

37:22.107 --> 37:25.143
That's the only reason
I had to find the other side
of the locket now,

37:25.143 --> 37:26.845
to keep the crowds
coming back.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.281
We'd have nothing
if we'd let the truth
get in the way.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.217
The truth that two brothers
loved each other so much,

37:32.217 --> 37:34.620
they reconciled
in the middle of battle.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.122
That's an even better story,
and it's filled with hope.

37:37.122 --> 37:40.492
You just wanted
your story told, didn't you?

37:40.492 --> 37:44.330
So the town would know
how awful war really is,

37:44.330 --> 37:47.333
to show them
why you chose peace.

37:47.333 --> 37:50.369
But what made you
end your feud?

37:57.409 --> 37:59.177
Both:
The people they loved.

37:59.177 --> 38:04.249
Uriah's son was killed
not but a mile from here
and he was 12 years old.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.619
I don't know anything
that would drive a man
away from war faster.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.620
( beeping )

38:08.620 --> 38:11.490
Uh, Stone,
you need to see this.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.625
The facial reconstruction
of Diana--

38:13.625 --> 38:14.626
It's complete.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.065
The wife
of a Confederate General

38:20.065 --> 38:22.834
in the Southern states,

38:22.834 --> 38:25.203
but they were never
legally married.

38:25.203 --> 38:26.805
It was forbidden then,

38:26.805 --> 38:27.739
and it was true love.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.609
That's why Carlton
turned his back

38:30.609 --> 38:32.611
on the Confederate cause.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.414
I didn't mean to lose it.
I'm sorry, Daddy.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.617
Milton's story's
still not finished yet.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.886
He's still looking for what
he lost on the battlefield.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.190
Your cap.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.025
You were looking
for your cap. You--

38:49.294 --> 38:53.331
Here. I think
your son needs this.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.996
So you think the economy
of your town would collapse

39:24.996 --> 39:26.231
if the truth came out?

39:26.231 --> 39:28.567
Well, think again, sister.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.969
It's a story of hope.
It's a story of love.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.739
It's brothers being brothers,
and right now,

39:33.739 --> 39:36.174
that is exactly
what this world needs.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.844
Of course you'll have to change
the name of your town again.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.178
To what?

39:40.178 --> 39:41.613
Forgiveness.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.783
( laughing, chattering )

39:44.783 --> 39:46.985
Of course.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.787
The Forgiveness Festival.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.021
Guys, look.

40:16.682 --> 40:20.218
Well, that's one Civil War town
that's a little more civil.

40:20.218 --> 40:23.121
And good news.
We've changed our minds.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.758
There should absolutely be
more than one Librarian
in the library,

40:26.758 --> 40:28.193
especially if our Librarians

40:28.193 --> 40:30.862
are as united
as Jones and Stone.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.532
Oh, okay.
Well, this is awkward.

40:33.532 --> 40:37.102
Yes. Um, we discovered

40:37.102 --> 40:38.770
a group of letters

40:38.770 --> 40:40.639
between
the Westphalian brothers,

40:40.639 --> 40:42.774
and reading them,
it becomes pretty clear

40:42.774 --> 40:44.710
as to why they fell apart.

40:44.710 --> 40:48.146
The root sin
seems to be that they both

40:48.146 --> 40:50.348
became excessively selfish,

40:50.348 --> 40:53.552
putting their own
personal interests

40:53.552 --> 40:54.686
ahead of the Library's.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.623
Which is what
we've all be doing.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.692
I wanted us all
to stay Librarians

41:00.692 --> 41:03.428
because I wanted
to be a Librarian.

41:03.428 --> 41:07.032
So we have come to agree
with Mr. Dare.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.534
So you've changed your minds

41:08.534 --> 41:10.502
about how many Librarians
there should be,

41:10.502 --> 41:11.937
we've changed our minds

41:11.937 --> 41:14.105
about how many Librarians
there should be,

41:14.105 --> 41:16.742
so we're all still
in complete disagreement

41:16.742 --> 41:18.610
about how many Librarians
there should be.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.780
And the Tethering Ceremony
is approaching fast.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.914
So...

41:24.382 --> 41:26.484
where do we go from here?

41:42.300 --> 41:46.538
( theme music playing )
