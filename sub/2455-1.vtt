We have you on

room 539,
our most special suite.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.098
I think you'll find it
very LA.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.670
Cool.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.171
Uh, Mr. Brown,

03:59.172 --> 04:00.906

04:00.907 --> 04:02.907
my name's Rhonda and I'm

Oh, good to meet you, man.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.633
I love your work.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.068
Thank you.
Big fan.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.471
So glad you agreed to
do this so last minute, man.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.073
You are the perfect Vaxy.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.808
Cool, man.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.476
Obviously this movie
is very important to me,

06:17.477 --> 06:19.211
you know?
Excuse me.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.580
Regan, do you think we
could get a picture with you?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.015
Yeah, I'm in a meeting,
but if you wait a second...

06:23.016 --> 06:24.049
Come along, girls.
Let's move along. Move it.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.818
Dude, dude, dude, dude...

06:25.819 --> 06:26.986

Yeah, come on.
We'll take a photo real quick.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.590
You mind, Tim?
No, no, no, no.

06:31.591 --> 06:32.658
So, how do you
like Shreveport?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.193
I like it. It's cool.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.661
- I just got here, but...
- A little bit closer.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.830
Okay, good.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.832
Okay, okay.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.800
Thanks, Regan.
Nice meeting you.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.002
Mr. Pearce...
Yeah?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.771
You want me to post up?

06:45.772 --> 06:47.907
I don't think so, man.
I think I'm good.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.341
All right, if you need me,
I'll be right there.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.609
Okay.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.448
Um...

06:56.449 --> 06:58.183
Now, I don't pretend to know
anything about your process,

06:58.184 --> 07:00.753
but I like to do
a ton of rehearsals.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.588
Just get in the room,
the two of us, man, and...

07:02.589 --> 07:05.357
Uh-oh! Look who's
in Shreveport!

07:09.529 --> 07:11.697
Regan, glad you finally made it.
Tony.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.967
Tony Cunningham! I'm the guy
who writes the fucking cheque,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.235

07:16.236 --> 07:17.369

07:17.370 --> 07:19.371
Uh...

07:19.372 --> 07:21.040
Huh? He's a genius!

07:21.041 --> 07:23.142
Huh? And Timmy, am I right?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.543
- Oh...

07:24.544 --> 07:25.644
Huh? You love this kid?

07:25.645 --> 07:27.212
This kid's a star

07:27.213 --> 07:30.316
and we're going to be
the ones to remind him.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.151
Look how ripped Pearce is.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.120
All right,
don't let me interrupt.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.557
You guys do your thing.
We'll meet back here 7:30,

07:38.558 --> 07:41.226
get us some nice steaks,
find us some pussy.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.995
How's that sound?!

07:42.996 --> 07:44.663
Look who's in Shreveport!

07:44.664 --> 07:46.231
Hey, Schiff, it's Regan.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.833
I'm freaking out
a little, man.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.735
Can you give me
a call back as soon as you can?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.070
Okay, bye.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.451
<i>Front desk.</i>

08:05.452 --> 08:07.920
Hey, there's no
internet in my room.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.756
<i>Yeah, the internet's been
down for a couple days now.</i>

08:10.757 --> 08:12.858
Okay. Is it
going to come back on?

08:12.859 --> 08:15.594
<i>Uh, they're working on it.
I'll let you know if it does.</i>

08:15.595 --> 08:16.628
Okay, thank you.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.960
- Yo, Schiff, Schiff, it's Reagan.
<i>- Yo, man, what's up?</i>

08:47.961 --> 08:50.329
Hey, man, this is going
to be a fucking mess, dude.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.663
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:51.664 --> 08:54.466
I am totally regretting
taking this job.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.035
I just sat down with the
director and, Schiff, dude,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.703
this guy is a fucking moron.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.304
Maybe a nice guy,

08:59.305 --> 09:01.073
but, you know,
he's just not a director.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.143
And this fucking Tony guy,
have you met him?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.844
<i>What the hell happened
to my career, man?</i>

09:05.845 --> 09:08.347
Hey, I hear you.
Try to calm down.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.315
Just tell me
what the issues are.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.717
<i>How's the room?</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:14.720
The room? Who cares
about the room, man?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.656
Look, I'm sorry. The fact is
this isn't a long shoot

09:17.657 --> 09:19.358
<i>and chances are no one's
even going to see it.</i>

09:19.359 --> 09:21.260
Well, then why
the fuck am I doing it?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.494
You know why.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.063
Did we hear back
on the Cameron movie?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.668
<i>As a matter of fact,
I caught Avi earlier today.</i>

09:29.669 --> 09:31.703
He's still a fan, man,

09:31.704 --> 09:33.238
but he thinks you're a little
old for the way they're going.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.174
<i>They want to play
this a bit younger.</i>

09:35.175 --> 09:37.276
<i>And we've had this
discussion many times before.</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:39.211
You know what we need
is that game changer

09:39.212 --> 09:41.513
that's going to get you
back on those studio lists.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.749
It's just a matter of time.
It's gonna happen.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.251

12:06.159 --> 12:07.859
<i>Flashpoints,</i> yup.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.195
They didn't tell me
they moved up my pickup time.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.332
Tell him we want to get going.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.768
Uh, they want to get you going
a little early, I guess.

Yeah. They just want
me to come along

12:41.260 --> 12:42.995
and make sure
everything goes good.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.865
Man, I couldn't sleep
for shit last night.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.203
Always happens the first
night in a new place.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.542
Yeah, it's got to be tough,
being on the road.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.444

Hey, Junior, you got it?

Hey, p-people are
going to be looking for me.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.100
Good.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.935
What do you guys want? Money?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.705
I will make the call to
my business manager right now.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.707
I'll him to wire you

I could get you...

18:37.783 --> 18:40.151
at least a million dollars

18:40.152 --> 18:42.153
and no one will
ever know this happened.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.159
I don't want your fucking money.

Pretty boy.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.135

doing this to me?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.573
I'm Diana's husband.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.476
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.677
Oh, you'll remember.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.912
I'll make sure we remember...

I don't know any Diana!

19:16.589 --> 19:18.623
Are you listening to me?!

19:20.960 --> 19:23.094
I don't know her!

19:23.095 --> 19:24.863
What are you doing with that?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.965
These are bolt cutters.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.767
They'd cut through anything.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.201
They'd cut you
free of them chains

19:30.202 --> 19:32.604
or snap through
your bones like twigs.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.606
But I'm gon' use 'em to
chop off something a lot softer.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.141
Oh, no, no...

19:36.142 --> 19:39.210
I'm gon' take something
from you now, boy!

19:39.211 --> 19:40.512
No, no!
Yeah!

19:40.513 --> 19:41.780
No, no, no!

19:41.781 --> 19:43.381
No, no!

19:43.382 --> 19:46.351
No!

19:46.352 --> 19:48.219
Mike, I got it.
What are you doing?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.055
I'm gon' cut his
fucking balls off!

19:50.056 --> 19:51.656
Oh, you don't
wanna do that, Mike.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.359
He'll bleed to death
right there on the floor.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.127
I thought you wanted to keep
him alive for a little while.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.629
Get the fuck off me!

19:57.630 --> 19:59.130
Junior, hand me
that gator thumper.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.498
Which one?

20:00.499 --> 20:02.367
The big 'un,
right there! Get it!

20:05.871 --> 20:08.139
Fuck. What the fuck is that?

20:08.140 --> 20:11.242
Now you ain't never gonna
touch what ain't yours again.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.600
Oh!

21:51.277 --> 21:52.911
Shit.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.125
Thought you was dead.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.327
You ain't moved in a day.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.772
Here, take this.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.543
Take it.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.712
Don't-don't spit it.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.389
Go on, swallow it down now.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.061
If you don't,

22:43.062 --> 22:45.897
pain's gonna
kill you 'fore he does.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.132
It's just an Oxy.

22:56.408 --> 22:59.377
You made it.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.755
You remember her yet?

23:10.756 --> 23:13.258
No, man, I swear.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.493
I've been really
fucked up the past few years.

23:15.494 --> 23:16.594
There's so much shit I don't...

23:16.595 --> 23:18.997
Bullshit!
Dark hair, 5'6,

23:18.998 --> 23:20.932
worked on your movie!

23:20.933 --> 23:21.933
In wardrobe?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.069
Even if I did
do anything with her,

23:28.507 --> 23:30.375
I would have had no
idea she was married, man.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.909
I wouldn't do that.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.611
I would never knowingly
fuck another guy's wife!

23:33.612 --> 23:34.812
Oh, yeah?
What's your password?

23:37.349 --> 23:38.349
What?

23:38.350 --> 23:39.717
Junior?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.292
"2259."

23:51.096 --> 23:52.530
You know, man,

23:53.766 --> 23:56.301
you work together
with somebody

23:56.302 --> 23:58.703
on a movie set
for a couple months,

23:58.704 --> 24:00.271
you don't know
their whole life.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.040
You don't erase your shit, huh?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.941
"Okay, sexy,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.977
just tell him you're out with
your girlfriends." Tell who?

24:05.978 --> 24:09.380
I don't even know when
I would have written that, man.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.149
"Last night was insane.
I want more."

24:11.150 --> 24:12.817
That's not what it sounds like.

24:12.818 --> 24:13.818
"That was the best..."

24:17.556 --> 24:19.524
Oh...

24:40.145 --> 24:42.480
Who's that?

24:43.982 --> 24:46.617
It's that actress...

24:46.618 --> 24:48.753
buck naked.
You know the one.

24:48.754 --> 24:49.754
He used to date her.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.357
Look, there's another.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.962
Now, I have seen
her in something.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.332
Oh... lookie here.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.604
What's that one?

25:06.605 --> 25:10.241
It's him...
naked like a "B."

25:17.883 --> 25:19.243
Hey, what's your
computer password?

25:21.620 --> 25:22.620
"Evolution."

25:25.290 --> 25:26.624
What?

25:26.625 --> 25:29.260
"Evolution."

25:33.732 --> 25:35.733
How do you spell it?!

25:39.371 --> 25:42.473
"E-v-o-l-

25:42.474 --> 25:45.410
u-t-i-o-n."

26:43.068 --> 26:44.535
Come on.

26:44.536 --> 26:45.970
Get some. It's good.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.305
I don't want any, bro.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.606
It's good.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.041
It smells like shit.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.242
Come on,
get you a couple.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.277
No, thank you.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.946
You should at least
get another Oxy in you,

26:54.947 --> 26:56.714
maybe some water.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.983
Come on. Go ahead.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.053
What the fuck
are you doing?!

27:02.054 --> 27:03.054
You feedin' him?!

27:03.055 --> 27:06.858
He don't need nothing!

27:10.095 --> 27:12.497
You were right.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.800
They lookin' for you.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.301
About 100 missed calls,

27:17.302 --> 27:20.171
texts.
"Regan, it's Caroline.

27:20.172 --> 27:24.075
Where are you? Butch said
you left with a friend

27:24.076 --> 27:26.244
before your pickup time.
Please get back to me."

27:26.245 --> 27:29.247
Well, I'll be...

27:29.248 --> 27:30.815
You really are
something special.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.751
Or maybe all the attention's

27:33.752 --> 27:35.520
'cause, see, what we did,

27:35.521 --> 27:37.588
while you was
having some quiet time,

27:37.589 --> 27:39.257
we're sending them
pretty pictures

27:39.258 --> 27:42.026
from your cell phone
out to a couple big websites.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.427
Junior knows 'em all.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.296
He is a halfwit,

27:45.297 --> 27:48.599
but one half knows
computer shit somehow.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.720
Anyway, they loved 'em.
Look at this. It's everywhere:

27:52.504 --> 27:53.784
Radar Online, TMZ, Perez Hilton,

27:56.775 --> 27:58.209
even CNN, Huffington Post.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.013
"Another celebrity
cell phone hacked."

28:04.983 --> 28:07.451
Hey, they saying it was
his cell phone got hacked.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.487
They don't think it was him.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.690
Well, get on his
Twitter and tell 'em that way.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.459
He got one.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.628
You twitter, faggot?

28:17.629 --> 28:19.469
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you get the credit.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.567
Time to feed the gators!

30:07.406 --> 30:09.707
Mike, get in here!

30:15.914 --> 30:18.349
Look, come check it out.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.085
Oh!

30:21.086 --> 30:24.121
We got us a tree shaker!

30:24.122 --> 30:25.922
"Pearce tweets
responsibility for photo leaks.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.996
Tells Hollywood Jews
to go fuck themselves."

30:31.997 --> 30:34.098
I added that.

30:34.099 --> 30:36.834
Why do you even fucking
care about doing this shit?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.769
Why don't you just kill me?

30:38.770 --> 30:39.770
Oh, not yet.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.606
First, I'm gon'
destroy you,

30:44.810 --> 30:47.378
the way you did me.

30:47.379 --> 30:51.048
I'm gon' take your life
and reputation from you,

30:51.049 --> 30:53.718
humiliate your ass publically,

30:53.719 --> 30:55.720
make sure the world thinks

30:55.721 --> 30:57.955
you're the biggest
piece of shit on the planet.

30:57.956 --> 31:00.057
Then I'm gon' kill you.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.692
You gon' die
knowing you hated.

31:02.394 --> 31:05.229
I mean, it's working so far!

31:09.735 --> 31:11.902
They think you lost it!

31:11.903 --> 31:14.905
Saying you committed
public suicide.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.808
Guess it won't be a surprise
when you turn up dead.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.310
But first,

31:19.311 --> 31:21.479
I wrote you a little something

31:21.480 --> 31:23.080
for your outgoing
cell phone message.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.983
It's a kind of, um...

31:25.984 --> 31:26.984
script.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.822
And you gon' read it

31:31.823 --> 31:33.103
and you gon' make me believe it.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.660
Or I'm gon' split you...

31:39.498 --> 31:41.465
and watch you die slow.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.016
Nobody talks like this.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.586
Come on, man,
you can do better than that.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.525
I'm fucked anyway.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.959
You wanna make
'em think I'm crazy,

32:08.960 --> 32:11.862
let's get fucking crazy.
This shit is weak.

32:11.863 --> 32:13.223
Junior, give me
that fucking phone.

32:16.301 --> 32:18.969
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm not as dumb as you think.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.474
What is it?

32:24.142 --> 32:26.043
"2259."

32:29.281 --> 32:31.615
Go on.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.056
Yo, this is Regan.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.325
Don't bother calling
this number anymore.

32:41.326 --> 32:44.428
I'm out. Basically,
fuck you to everybody.

32:44.429 --> 32:47.398
Kristy!

32:47.399 --> 32:49.133
Especially the Jews,

32:49.134 --> 32:51.101
for all the sins you
committed against the world.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.862
Praise be to Allah.
I die an enlightened man.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.812
Yeah!

33:01.813 --> 33:04.215
You workin'
for me now, boy.

33:05.884 --> 33:08.452
<i>A major Hollywood scandal
unfolding this afternoon.</i>

33:10.956 --> 33:12.857
<i>Actor Regan Pearce,</i>

33:12.858 --> 33:15.759
<i>best known for the Oscar
winning ensemble drama</i> Volume

33:15.760 --> 33:18.529
<i>and the hit dark comedy

33:18.530 --> 33:21.465
<i>allegedly posting naked
photos of his famous exes</i>

33:21.466 --> 33:23.601
<i>last last night
on the internet.</i>

33:23.602 --> 33:25.603
<i>Then today, Pearce
took to his Twitter feed,</i>

33:25.604 --> 33:27.638
<i>claiming responsibility
for the leaks,</i>

33:27.639 --> 33:30.374
<i>and then later, unleashing
an anti-Semitic tirade</i>

33:30.375 --> 33:31.876
<i>against Hollywood.</i>

33:31.877 --> 33:34.645
<i>Now, Pearce is

<i>He has a minor arrest record,</i>

33:36.648 --> 33:39.016
<i>including a DUI,

<i>Pearce, who was in

34:02.674 --> 34:04.308
<i>Pearce's publicist Nicole Perna</i>

34:04.309 --> 34:06.143
<i>issuing this statement
just moments ago:</i>

34:06.144 --> 34:09.813
<i>"The person responsible

<i>We hope to be in
contact with him shortly</i>

34:15.320 --> 34:16.679
<i>to get him the help
that he needs."</i>

34:17.289 --> 34:19.889
You done real good
with that message.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.962
You should be an actor.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.770
But now you gon'
tell me a real story.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.275
Of course you'd be a cop.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.463
Ex-cop.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.298
I work in security now.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.767
Got dismissed from the force

35:03.768 --> 35:07.104
about a year and a half ago.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.807
Don't you want to know why?

35:09.808 --> 35:10.888
Got me on a heavy domestic.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.813
They took my badge.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.215
I did a year.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.584
Lost my house.

35:20.585 --> 35:23.921
Can't see my kids no more.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.922
And almost everyone I knew
turned they backs on me.

35:28.093 --> 35:30.561
And that's all
because of the story

35:30.562 --> 35:31.642
you gon' tell me right now.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.234
Story of the first time
you fucked my wife.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.573
You hearin' me, boy?

35:44.209 --> 35:45.676
I want every detail!

35:47.312 --> 35:48.672
Each and every
thing you did to her

35:51.850 --> 35:53.090
and every thing she did to you.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.588
You hearin' me, faggot?!

36:00.925 --> 36:03.060
Fucking pussy.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.835
Whoo-ee!

36:11.836 --> 36:13.604
I do got to say,

36:13.605 --> 36:15.305
they always got you
in some pictures

36:15.306 --> 36:17.141
with some pretty-ass bitches.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.143
God damn, look at this one.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.780
I'll be you
said some things.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.853
Hey, I gotta ask,

36:29.854 --> 36:32.156
What was it like
working with Clint Eastwood?

36:32.157 --> 36:34.124
Now, he's the shit.

36:34.125 --> 36:37.795
That's a real fucking man.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.463
Fucking pussy.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.633
Yeah.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.571
Yeah, it's been a good run.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.707
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

36:49.708 --> 36:52.810
it fucking sucks that
it's got to end this way,

36:52.811 --> 36:55.813
but overall,
I've been a lucky man.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.816
I've had pretty much
every experience

36:58.817 --> 37:01.318
I ever wanted to.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.319
Yeah.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.988
Yeah, think I'm good.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.492
Hey, Mike.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.594
Yeah?

37:10.595 --> 37:13.097
Let me tell you that story.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.061
So, I gave her
a ride home from work, right?

37:27.545 --> 37:30.748
She wanted me to see
this kitten she was keeping,

37:30.749 --> 37:32.629
she found behind her
hotel a couple days before.

37:33.351 --> 37:34.618
We talked, hung out,

37:37.355 --> 37:38.355
had a few drinks.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.558
And then she starts telling me

37:45.196 --> 37:46.930
about her scumbag of a husband.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.933
This motherfucker's
one of those

37:49.934 --> 37:50.934
domineering, egotistical,

37:53.872 --> 37:55.939
fucking pieces of shit

37:55.940 --> 37:58.308
with a perpetual need
to just eviscerate others

37:58.309 --> 38:00.377
so he feels better
about himself.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.880
You know, like,
to compensate

38:02.881 --> 38:04.848
for his shortcomings.

38:08.419 --> 38:11.221
I just listened, man.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.557
She cried.

38:13.558 --> 38:16.393
I wanted to
hold her, so I did.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.428
She said I made
her feel like a woman.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.065
Then she lead me
to the bedroom

38:23.935 --> 38:26.904
and started
going down on me.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.339
I was surprised,
but I didn't stop her.

38:33.278 --> 38:34.478
After awhile,
she straddles me,

38:37.582 --> 38:40.417
pulls her panties to the side,

38:40.418 --> 38:41.418
put me inside her.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.257
It was amazing...

38:47.258 --> 38:49.993
for both of us.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.029
When we finished
a couple hours later,

38:52.030 --> 38:55.098
she told me I made
her come four times.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.270
And then she laughed
when she told me

39:00.271 --> 39:02.940
that you never had once.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.059
I guess your tiny
rent-a-cop dick

39:12.684 --> 39:14.952
<i>ever could
get the job done.</i>

39:55.727 --> 39:56.894
Kill me.

39:57.495 --> 40:00.264
Not yet.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.501
I...

40:04.502 --> 40:06.370
...ain't... done!

40:22.287 --> 40:24.021
Here they are, Mike.
I got two of 'em.

40:24.022 --> 40:27.624
Be back day after tomorrow,
finish this up.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.730
I just totally
lost my shit in there.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.367
Hope he makes it
till I get back.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.872
Don't you fucking go getting
soft and sweet on me, boy.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.211
Man up!

40:48.212 --> 40:52.516
Save that gas in the gennie.

40:57.789 --> 41:01.158
Hey...

41:01.159 --> 41:03.160
come here.

41:07.732 --> 41:09.052
You done real good
so far, Junior.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.137
I love you.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.074
You a good nephew.

44:13.851 --> 44:16.820
It's 'bout to be lunch.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.488
She came up in here. She was
trying to fill up her belly

44:18.489 --> 44:20.257
before she hibernating.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.258
I just saved your life.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.920
Now, a gator jaws snap shut
'bout 2000 pounds of force,

44:27.598 --> 44:29.099
but once you up on it like this,

44:29.100 --> 44:31.368
it ain't got
no muscle for opening.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.803
Even one hand'll do.

44:39.944 --> 44:42.012
Phew...

44:45.283 --> 44:48.251
You welcome.

44:55.159 --> 44:57.894
I never seen 'em come
all the way up inside before.

44:57.895 --> 45:00.797
Probably smelled
all that blood in here,

45:00.798 --> 45:02.799
heard you moaning,
thrashing around,

45:02.800 --> 45:05.335
figured she could
get in on an easy meal.

45:05.336 --> 45:07.304
Huh...

45:07.305 --> 45:09.406
Best we get you
up off the floor.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.160
All right...

45:33.764 --> 45:36.233
There you go.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.235
All right, get comfy.

46:13.404 --> 46:16.239
Phew...

46:19.243 --> 46:21.544
Hey, now, she a pretty
little bitch, ain't she?

46:50.241 --> 46:52.742
Hello?

46:52.743 --> 46:55.512
Yeah, he breathin'.

46:55.513 --> 46:58.148
I seen it.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.469
No, he's still right there
on the floor where you left him.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.120
All right, then.

47:54.171 --> 47:56.873
Hey, Mike.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.875

Yeah, I guess I did.

50:41.405 --> 50:44.874
Mm-hmm, yeah, okay.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.076
Been through
the other way anyway.

51:04.929 --> 51:06.996
Hey, Junior...

51:06.997 --> 51:09.198
What is it?

51:09.199 --> 51:11.067
I gotta piss
so fucking bad, man.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.269
Can you hold it?

51:13.270 --> 51:16.706
Until when?
Don't make me

51:16.707 --> 51:18.408
piss on myself again.
That's really fucked up.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.276
Okay, I guess
I'm-a unhook you, but...

51:24.181 --> 51:27.183
you gotta keep those
hands in them cuffs, okay?

51:42.232 --> 51:44.534
All right, careful
on that-that hand there.

51:44.535 --> 51:47.203
Come on, I'm-a get you up.

51:47.204 --> 51:50.907
Oh, let's go
get you drained.

51:50.908 --> 51:52.976
I can't walk, bro.
My feet are tied together.

51:52.977 --> 51:55.211
Um...

51:55.212 --> 51:58.314
I'm not going to run.
My legs are fucked

51:58.315 --> 52:00.183
and I don't even know
where the fuck we are.

52:05.389 --> 52:07.590
Okay, all right.

52:07.591 --> 52:09.559
I know what I'm-a do.

52:11.829 --> 52:13.429
I'm-a hold this
bungee end like a tether.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.541
And if you run,
I'm-a snap you down, okay?

52:22.072 --> 52:23.339
Okay.
Come on.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.341
Toilet's behind that wall.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.261
Don't even think about it.

52:45.262 --> 52:47.263
I don't want to
have to hurt you extra.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.539
All right, now,
I'm-a stay out here.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.908
You go on
and do your business.

53:21.331 --> 53:23.533
Shit...

53:29.673 --> 53:30.873
You all right in there?

53:30.874 --> 53:32.375
Yeah.

53:53.263 --> 53:55.331
Come on,
let's get you going.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.421
That's Mike.
He's checking in.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.256
I got to answer
that mobile phone.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.024
Get you on the cot.

54:22.025 --> 54:23.292
Come on!

54:31.568 --> 54:33.936
Come on.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.141
Come on, come on, come on.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.554
Mike?!

54:51.555 --> 54:54.090
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

54:54.091 --> 54:55.958
Yeah, Mike.
Everything's great.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.327
Then why the fuck
didn't you pick up the phone,

54:58.328 --> 54:59.595
<i>you fucking crackhead?</i>

54:59.596 --> 55:01.664
I went for it,
but it went quiet.

55:01.665 --> 55:04.433
<i>What's he doing?</i>

55:04.434 --> 55:05.594
Same as before,
when you left.

55:08.438 --> 55:10.306
I got this, Mike.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.941
<i>All right then.</i>

55:11.942 --> 55:13.910
Between now and when I get back,

55:13.911 --> 55:15.845
that phone rings,
best you pick up

55:15.846 --> 55:17.847
or I'll have two piles of shit

55:17.848 --> 55:19.448
<i>to deal with.</i>

55:19.449 --> 55:21.651
I'll do it.

55:28.926 --> 55:29.926
Junior...

55:30.894 --> 55:32.695
What's he going
to do to me?

55:35.165 --> 55:36.866
I mean,
how's this supposed to end?

55:38.969 --> 55:40.736
What's the plan?

55:47.511 --> 55:49.412
You're okay with just
letting him kill me?

55:53.784 --> 55:55.418
'Cause you seem
like a good dude.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.391
Thank you.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.759
I ain't
running this thing.

56:05.128 --> 56:07.563
Yo, he called me up,
said he had a job.

56:09.533 --> 56:10.813
You supposed to help out family.

56:11.401 --> 56:13.636
Even though he don't
come 'round there

56:15.839 --> 56:17.940
too much no more,
he's still my uncle.

56:18.942 --> 56:21.510
So, you can live with that?

56:23.146 --> 56:25.882
Your uncle's fucking nuts, man.

56:27.684 --> 56:29.986
His wife never
told me she was married,

56:29.987 --> 56:32.755
and the truth is
I barely touched her.

56:32.756 --> 56:35.758
How do you know he's not
planning on killing you too?

56:35.759 --> 56:38.194
You think he gives
a fuck about you?

56:38.195 --> 56:41.864
You're the only witness.

56:41.865 --> 56:43.833
What if he tries to
frame you for this shit?

56:43.834 --> 56:45.234
The guy's a fucking psycho.

56:48.338 --> 56:52.008
I don't really feel
like talking no more.

56:52.009 --> 56:55.511
I think it's best
we get some sleep.

57:05.289 --> 57:07.189
<i>And how about
this Regan Pearce?</i>

57:07.190 --> 57:10.026
<i>This guy is making
Charlie Sheen</i>

57:10.027 --> 57:11.594
<i>look like Tom Hanks.</i>

57:14.932 --> 57:18.567
<i>Have you seen his Twitter feed?</i>

57:18.568 --> 57:19.936
<i>Oh, you filthy perverts.</i>

57:22.439 --> 57:24.240
<i>Well, needless to say,</i>

57:24.241 --> 57:25.875
<i>the two ladies in the
photographs are very upset.</i>

57:25.876 --> 57:27.810
Yes!

57:27.811 --> 57:29.931
<i>And from what I understand,
Regan's rabbi is furious.</i>

58:06.416 --> 58:09.018
God damn, it's a shiny day!

58:17.494 --> 58:20.363
You don't look so good, bro.

58:20.364 --> 58:23.432
Sun might do you some good.

58:28.171 --> 58:30.539
Yo, I figure if
I chain you to that cot,

58:30.540 --> 58:32.208
I could set you in the doorway.

58:32.209 --> 58:34.410
Sun'll bounce on you real nice.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.801
Okay, let's get you going.

59:18.021 --> 59:20.756
Let me know
if you get too hot.

59:20.757 --> 59:22.077
I'll help you off
with your shirt.

59:22.759 --> 59:24.894
Put some sun cream on you.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.932
Yeah, I'm right here, Mike.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.335
That's good, Junior.
I'm just checking in.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:42.571
Everything's sweet.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.974
When do you think
you're getting back in?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.935
Soon as I get off work.
I told you, it's my alibi.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.413
Well, what's my alibi, Mike?

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:52.748
<i>You don't need one, baby boy.</i>

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:56.318
Okay.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.655
Figure I'll get there
about 1:30 in the morning or so

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.123
<i>and we'll finish this thing up.</i>

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.458
So, 1:30,

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.426
I'll see you then.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.383
What are you doing here?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.854
I'm sorry just
showing up like this.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.189
You are not supposed to be here.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.657
I understand. Wait.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.792
Just hear me out
and I promise I'll go.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.962
Just give me two minutes.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:42.298
I'm telling you,
I feel different.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:43.779
Diana, I am not
a violent man anymore.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:48.404
That part of me is gone.

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:50.085
Diana, you know I
would never hurt my boys.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.309
Please...

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.814
I'll think about it.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.588
Mike...

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:07.556
can you grab her for me?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.958
Yeah.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.432
Hi.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:19.268
Hey, honey.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:22.238
Hello.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.290
Yo, yo, Junior, Junior.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.529
I got a headache, dude.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.305
You know, I really
love your movies.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:57.873
Really?

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.794
It feel kind of silly
talking about it, seeing...

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:04.580
the situation we in,

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.416
but I do, I love 'em.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.818
Huh...

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.087
What was the name
of that one you was in,

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.889
that nasty one,

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.792
with all them high school
kids that's fucking each other?

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.394
What was it, <i>Up Against Us?</i>

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.062
<i>Crimes Against Us.
</i> Yeah, that's it.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.233
Yeah, we watched that one

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:25.567
a whole mess of times
back in high school.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.604
And some of my friends

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:30.606
even took to
dressing like you in it.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.844
Yeah, people
still love that one.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.447
That's 'cause you were
such a badass in it.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.349
You were so fuckin' cool.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.084
You were the man in that one.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.022
I guess that probably
wasn't too hard

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.391
for you though, right?

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.597
You know, I gotta say,

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.299
you look real young
for your age.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.035
You must take real good...

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.316
like, real good
care of yourself.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.674
I guess so.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.776
I mean, I kind of have to.

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:11.380
It's like part of the job
in a way, you know?

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.116
I'm definitely not
perfect about it, but...

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:21.156
How about you, Junior?

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.157
You look pretty... fit.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.629
You work out?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.203
Yeah, I do mostly
body weight stuff.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:37.673
Well, it's working.
You look good.

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:40.209
Man, stop that.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.585
<i>Yesterday,
the entertainment world</i>

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:52.087
<i>was rocked by
nude celebrity photos,</i>

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:54.823
<i>anti-Semitic comments,
and the behaviour of an actor</i>

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:57.760
<i>that seemed to be
on a downward spiral.</i>

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:00.662
<i>But new information
could change all of that.</i>

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.231
<i>Early this morning,</i>

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.099
<i>investigators went
into the hotel room</i>

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.535
<i>in Shreveport, Louisiana
that Pearce was staying at</i>

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.538
<i>and found all of
his belongings inside.</i>

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:13.041
<i>Hotel surveillance video shows
Pearce getting into a van</i>

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.878
<i>that was not sent by
the production of</i> Flashpoints,

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:18.347
<i>a movie he was set
to start filming today.</i>

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.282
<i>Also, late last night,</i>

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:23.252
<i>Pearce changing his outgoing
voicemail greeting to this...</i>

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.788
<i>...to everybody,
especially all the Jews</i>

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.756
<i>for all the sins you
committed against the world.</i>

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.894
<i>Praise be to Allah.
I die an enlightened man.</i>

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.695
<i>Now, at first, it was thoughtnthat
this was just another sign</i>

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.898
<i>of a young actor
at the end of his rope.</i>

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.599
<i>However, it was discovered</i>

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.269
<i>that Pearce is actually
quoting dialogue verbatim</i>

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.105
<i>from his 2003 movie
</i> To Carry or Kill,

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:44.740
<i>the Iraq war drama,</i>

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.975
<i>in which he plays
a US soldier abducted</i>

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:49.878
<i>and held captive
by Muslim extremists.</i>

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.314
<i>And especially the Jews</i>

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:56.084
<i>for all the sins you
committed against the world.</i>

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.885
<i>Praise be to Allah.
I die an enlightened man.</i>

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.090
<i>Also in the recording,</i>

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:04.059
<i>you can hear Pearce
call out the name "Kristy,"</i>

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.495
<i>which happens to be his
character's name in the film.</i>

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.997
<i>Now, whether or not
this is some sort of code</i>

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.166
<i>or perhaps a suicide threat,</i>

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.235
<i>remains to be seen.
One thing is for certain,</i>

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.270
<i>police investigators are
still looking for that van,</i>

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.072
<i>and more importantly,</i>

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.208
<i>they want to know the
whereabouts of Regan Pearce.</i>

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.689
This your first
time eating gator?

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.690
Yeah, actually.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.860
A lot of people get...

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:42.764
a little turned off by the idea.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:43.765
Nah, not me.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.338
I'll try anything once.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.178
So?

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.881
How do you like it?

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:00.549
It's really fucking good.

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:03.285
Can you taste the crappie?

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.022
No, I said it's good.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.490
No.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:09.491
A crappie of fish.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.995
I put crappie of fish
in there.

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:16.965
It's...

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:20.168
See, there's, uh...

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:23.138
There's white crappie
and there's black crappie,

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:25.908
and I put the black crappie
in mine 'cause it's...

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:29.311
It's tenderer.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.317
You got a nice smile.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.720
Thank you, Junior.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.191
Well, you know what I mean.
It's...

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:46.862
You got them nice...

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:49.197
...you know, Hollywood teeth.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.543
You got a girlfriend, Junior?

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:04.246
Nah.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:07.616
How 'bout you?

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.184
Just ended something.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.623
I don't know.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.024
I'm thinking maybe it's time
for something different.

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.367
You want some more?

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.638
Mm-hmm.
Yes, please.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.392
Hey, can I "axe" you
something weird?

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.127
Go ahead.

01:08:56.099 --> 01:09:00.335
You ever try it on with a dude?

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.475
Hey, I've heard
if you get me drunk enough,

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.042
I'm down for whatever.
So...

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:18.185
I got some whiskey.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.832
You mind if I do a little pop?

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.502
No, go ahead, man.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.673
Mmm.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.879
Man,
this is good.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:49.017
What up with that cup, man?

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.453
Don't worry
about it, man.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.654
We don't need a cup.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:55.223
We can just drink
from the bottle.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.658
You can pour it
for me.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:59.561
Yeah.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:09.838
How's that?

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.474
It's working already,

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:16.078
and I can
feel something.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:23.251
It's weird.

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:25.253
My heart's beating all fast.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.891
There go
them Hollywood teeth again.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.661
You gon' make me do something.

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:45.907
Am I?

01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:14.136
All right, cut...
Stop.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:18.240
Get off me.
I just...

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.775
I can't, man.
I just, um...

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.761
Junior, man...

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.564
Dude, I'm just freaking out.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:43.965
I'm fucking desperate.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.967
You've been real good to me,

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.170
and I didn't mean
to upset you.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:53.341
It don't matter.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.778
I roofied your stew.

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:06.121
I just got to wait a little bit

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:08.957
and I can get at you
all night.

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:21.803
Oh, my God.

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.772
Oh, shit.

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.816
My head is
totally spinning.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.053
Oh, fuck.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.396
Oh, my God.
My head is just so...

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.398
Oh, my fucking head
is spinning.

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.238
Dude.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.540
I'm going to kill that boy.

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:28.810
Reginald,

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:30.979
this is Uncle Michael.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:33.982
You are a piece of shit!

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.320
Answer the fucking phone!

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.524
You are not a good nephew.

01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:44.159
Fuck you!
Answer the phone!

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.033
Reginald Hester Jr....

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:46.654
Motherfucker, boy!

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.795
Goddamn it.

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:51.986
What do you want?
Junior here?

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.421
You hear from him?

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.823
Junior,
he ain't nobody's thing.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:56.991
He ain't call you?

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:59.260
That boy never got no phone.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.981
The road's flooded.
I'm taking Jesse's boat.

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:03.998
Hey!

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.268
Jesse on a pumper,
he knock you

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:09.971
for turning me over.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:25.613
This will jar your preserves.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.790
Get back in the fucking house,
Corinne.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.795
Uh-uh.

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:35.663
I'm going to hold you up
for the ass right here

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.831
and watch Jesse lick on you.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.167
I'm-a bring it right back.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.336
You ain't taking our shit.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.870
Show up out of nowhere,

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.505
lay your hands on me
like I'm your old lady.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.208
You ain't about
to shoot straight, you junkie.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.889
I was deer hunting
at nine months pregnant.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.015
No wonder Junior
ain't worth a shit.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.491
Don't make me do it, Michael.

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:07.161
I'm gon' draw a bead.

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:08.996
Let's see
what you got, Corinne!

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:11.666
I'll draw a bead!

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.969
Motherfuck!

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:06.173
All right, then.

01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:10.978
All right,
then!

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:38.306
You in here, faggot?

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.645
I hope to hell you is.

01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:52.019
I seen Junior
down by the swamp.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:55.556
You done him pretty good.

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.961
I know you...

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.798
Dang.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.336
You come up a whopper.

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.714
You just come on out.

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:24.051
Be a real shame
expiring in the shitter.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.670
Oh.
He outside.

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.483
I got you.

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.289
Yeah, Mike.
You got me.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.859
So, at what point did you
realize, "I'm going to live"?

01:26:47.269 --> 01:26:49.303
You'd think it would have been
when Mike was gone.

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:55.676
Uh, dead.
But, uh,

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.679
I thought,
"Yeah, they were gone,

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.047
"but there was a good chance

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.348
I was going to die there
with them."

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:02.883
Why?

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:06.220
At that point I still had
the drugs in my system,

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.101
a roofie, and I was
pretty destroyed physically.

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:14.161
I knew Mike
had arrived by boat

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.530
and I would have gone straight
out there for it,

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:17.898
but I couldn't move very fast.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.700
I knew there were alligators
out there.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:23.237
Um, and so, I thought I'd wait
until the next morning,

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.372
and that's what I did.

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:27.875
Okay, so then,
you get in the boat,

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:29.236
you set out,
and then miraculously,

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:34.381
fisherman actually see you
or they hear you?

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:36.450
It's hard for me
to remember exactly

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.753
what transpired
during the rescue.

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:42.022
I know that they told me
that I was, uh, yelling...

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.794
<i>Incoherently when
they heard me,</i>

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:48.129
<i>and then by the time
they got out to the boat</i>

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:49.363
<i>I was in
that I was dead weight.</i>

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:50.931
<i>I was just out.</i>

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.701
<i>I was taken
to the hospital,</i>

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.303
and the doctor there told me
that if I had arrived

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.605
even two hours later than I did,

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.774
I would have been in a coma
or dead.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.108
Let's go back.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.469
In those quiet hours,
in those days

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:08.783
that were long and terrifying,

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.104
what did you think about
the most?

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:13.788
It became clear to me
in a life sense

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:20.628
how I could have been
a better person

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:22.062
up until this point,

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:23.731
and I would say
to myself repeatedly

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:27.334
that if I were lucky enough
to survive this,

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:30.838
that I would be.
I'd be a better human being.

01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:31.839
And that an awareness

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:36.744
of some kind, uh...

01:28:41.183 --> 01:28:45.186
That led me to believe
that maybe, um,

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:48.956
some of my choices and actions
had led me to this point,

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:51.277
or were in some way responsible
for the situation I was in.

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:54.528
That's a big admission.

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:02.369
And I thought about my mom
a lot.

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:16.282

in your life so far?

it was cast.

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:25.286
You said they were
going younger.

01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:26.787
Yeah, well,
all I can tell you is that

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.055
when the overnights

01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:29.924
