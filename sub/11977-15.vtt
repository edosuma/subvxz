WEBVTT

00:06.789 --> 00:08.789
Previously on Rogue...

00:10.125 --> 00:11.726
I need these fingerprints IDed.

00:11.727 --> 00:13.329
Prints belong to Gary Keyes.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.530
You got an address?

00:19.068 --> 00:21.271
US Marshals, put your hands on your head.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.208
You want to know how Marty
Stein makes his money?

00:25.209 --> 00:27.743
You take a closer look at Deanston Finance

00:27.744 --> 00:29.078
and his friend

00:29.079 --> 00:31.348
Greg Barrett who runs the thing.

00:31.349 --> 00:34.017
I wanna do an interview with her.

00:34.018 --> 00:36.954
- Is that you on the recording?
- Yes.

00:36.955 --> 00:38.689
Yes?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.425
They're doing a hatchet
job, those motherfuckers.

00:40.426 --> 00:42.293
They recut the whole goddamn thing.

00:42.294 --> 00:44.429
Miranda leaked the interview
to Gaffney this afternoon.

00:44.430 --> 00:46.231
He's called a vote to
terminate your partnership.

00:46.966 --> 00:48.433
Well...

00:48.434 --> 00:49.702
It was close.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.438
I need a loan, Marty.

00:52.439 --> 00:55.908
This is reparation. This is
the price of letting you live.

00:55.909 --> 00:57.376
He's gonna set me up with a package,

00:57.377 --> 00:58.444
get me back on my feet.

00:58.445 --> 00:59.646
You did well.

00:59.647 --> 01:02.849
Marty Stein, I have a
warrant for your arrest.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.316
It says that you used your connections

01:04.318 --> 01:06.319
to get your boyfriend
off on a cocaine charge.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.590
- It's a bullshit charge.
- There's gonna be an investigation.

01:08.591 --> 01:10.791
Until then, you're on
administrative leave.

02:04.044 --> 02:06.046
Where is Gary Keyes, Mr. Kelly?

02:06.047 --> 02:07.914
I've told you, I don't know.

02:07.915 --> 02:09.249
Keep selling me that same horseshit,

02:09.250 --> 02:10.984
we're gonna be at this all day.

02:10.985 --> 02:13.253
Is that supposed to make
me change my answers?

02:13.254 --> 02:15.123
I'm telling you, that's all I know.

02:15.124 --> 02:16.858
Because if you're into something, Jen...

02:16.859 --> 02:18.192
"Into something"?

02:18.193 --> 02:19.794
I'm saying, it's better
if you tell us now.

02:19.795 --> 02:22.063
He's my boss. That's it.

02:22.064 --> 02:23.932
What were you doing at the house?

02:23.933 --> 02:26.602
- I was looking for Jen.
- Why?

02:26.603 --> 02:28.470
Well, she hadn't come in
to work for a couple days,

02:28.471 --> 02:30.472
and, uh, I got concerned.

02:30.473 --> 02:31.807
So call the police.

02:31.808 --> 02:33.143
Oh, that was my next move. Yeah.

02:33.144 --> 02:35.545
After you broke into her house?

02:35.546 --> 02:37.680
I thought I heard a scream.

02:37.681 --> 02:39.149
Says you've been MIA
the last couple of days.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.085
- Yeah, so?
- So, where you been?

02:41.685 --> 02:44.221
Home. School. Friends...

02:44.222 --> 02:45.956
Look, I blew off work. So what?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.825
There was no one else inside.

02:47.826 --> 02:51.028
I know. And I said, I
thought I heard a scream.

02:51.029 --> 02:54.099
It could have been one of the
neighbor's kids... I mean, look...

02:54.100 --> 02:55.967
I was worried about Jen.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.304
Is any of this gonna
help you find my uncle?

02:59.305 --> 03:01.173
I'm not buying it.

03:01.174 --> 03:04.243
Okay. Well, I'm sorry if you
feel that way, but it's the truth.

03:04.244 --> 03:06.313
All right, Mr. Kelly.

03:08.248 --> 03:09.516
Sit tight.

03:29.205 --> 03:30.539
What do you make of all this?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.808
I don't know.

03:32.809 --> 03:34.677
Jen vouches for him.

03:34.678 --> 03:36.278
Feels like she's holding back, though.

03:36.279 --> 03:38.414
Yeah. I'm getting a whiff
of that on my end too.

03:38.415 --> 03:40.417
Anything on the gun they found on him?

03:40.418 --> 03:41.885
Nothing yet.

03:41.886 --> 03:43.620
Did he say what the hell
he was doing in there?

03:43.621 --> 03:46.289
Sticking to the "screaming woman" line.

03:46.290 --> 03:47.891
Well, the guy did two
tours of Afghanistan.

03:47.892 --> 03:50.161
Maybe he's got a bit of a hero complex.

03:50.162 --> 03:53.364
He's got a bit of a
bullshit complex, more like.

03:53.365 --> 03:55.766
Think it'd do any good to
hold him for a couple of days?

03:55.767 --> 03:56.834
I don't know.

03:56.835 --> 03:58.905
Ir's been the same story
the last four hours.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.174
I say we bounce 'em.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.843
See what's what when the gun comes back.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.112
Yeah.

04:18.593 --> 04:20.327
What happened to you, Mia?

04:20.327 --> 04:21.863
You were supposed to be
watching my fucking back.

04:22.731 --> 04:24.331
Uh... I don't...

04:24.332 --> 04:26.868
I don't know, Ethan.
They came out of nowhere.

04:26.869 --> 04:30.005
Look, I'm sorry.

04:31.807 --> 04:33.542
Forget it. Let's go.

04:33.543 --> 04:35.143
- Let's go.
- You know, why don't you just say what you're thinking?

04:35.144 --> 04:36.879
What am I thinking?

04:36.880 --> 04:39.549
I saw that look on your face
when the marshals lead you out.

04:39.550 --> 04:40.750
You think I turned you in.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.485
What was I supposed to think?

04:42.486 --> 04:44.220
I don't know. But not that.

04:44.221 --> 04:48.759
Okay, well, nobody else knew
I was in there except you.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.161
We're gonna have to figure this out.

04:56.368 --> 04:57.903
Stay here.

05:09.182 --> 05:10.516
Hey, Jen.

05:10.517 --> 05:11.984
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

05:11.985 --> 05:13.342
- What?
- W... who the fuck are you?

05:13.343 --> 05:15.055
Answer my question.

05:15.056 --> 05:16.656
Ethan, I...

05:16.657 --> 05:19.126
Okay. You know what? Come on. Come on.

05:20.394 --> 05:22.463
Here, drive.

05:37.747 --> 05:39.615
So, you targeted me?

05:39.616 --> 05:41.551
Your plan?

05:42.286 --> 05:44.420
It was my idea.

05:44.421 --> 05:47.223
I knew Gary didn't have
it in him. Not anymore.

05:47.224 --> 05:49.225
Not after so long.

05:49.226 --> 05:50.426
What do you mean, "Have it in him"?

05:50.427 --> 05:52.830
Figured if I helped, maybe we could...

05:55.100 --> 05:56.567
What?

05:56.568 --> 05:59.770
I've been in witness
protection since I was 10.

05:59.771 --> 06:04.442
My dad turned states against some
Russian mobster called Samara Bratva,

06:04.443 --> 06:06.311
but he didn't make it to the trial.

06:06.312 --> 06:08.247
I don't understand, Jen.

06:09.649 --> 06:12.451
Gary raised me after
the mob killed my dad.

06:12.452 --> 06:14.854
- Gary's not your...
- He's my uncle.

06:14.855 --> 06:17.123
Treated me like I was his though.

06:17.124 --> 06:20.127
Marshals relocated us to Chicago
after he testified. It's...

06:20.995 --> 06:22.863
Been almost 20 years.

06:22.864 --> 06:25.265
Thought we were safe by now.

06:25.266 --> 06:26.288
You wanna know the funny part?

06:26.289 --> 06:28.065
He was taking out a life insurance policy.

06:28.069 --> 06:30.071
That's how they found us.

06:30.072 --> 06:30.822
One day he wasn't thinking,

06:30.823 --> 06:33.666
and he used his old social
security number, and bam...

06:35.144 --> 06:37.412
They gave him two
options, either work a job,

06:37.413 --> 06:40.416
or watch as they sawed the
heads off of his wife and kids.

06:45.288 --> 06:46.956
Some choice.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.362
My uncle's dead, isn't he?

06:56.634 --> 06:58.570
I'm sorry, Jen.

07:02.641 --> 07:04.241
What did he do for him?

07:04.242 --> 07:07.846
- Hmm?
- What did he do for him?

07:07.847 --> 07:09.448
Mia. They wanted Mia.

07:09.449 --> 07:11.584
What do you mean? Dead?

07:11.585 --> 07:12.651
Why do they want Mia dead?

07:12.652 --> 07:15.454
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

07:15.455 --> 07:17.590
You know what? I don't believe you.

07:17.591 --> 07:21.128
Honestly, Ethan, I could give a
shit right now what you believe.

07:22.663 --> 07:24.397
- I need a name.
- Why?

07:24.398 --> 07:26.533
What are you... You gonna
take on the Russian mob?

07:26.534 --> 07:28.535
Why the fuck do you care what I do?

07:28.536 --> 07:32.005
If I were you Ethan, I would run as
far away from that girl as possible.

07:32.006 --> 07:34.675
- Did your uncle have a contact?
- What?

07:34.676 --> 07:37.479
Is there somebody that he dealt with, Jen?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.347
Uh... Levsha.

07:39.348 --> 07:40.949
Levsha?

07:40.950 --> 07:43.351
Yeah. One time, I saw it in his phone.

07:43.352 --> 07:45.087
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

07:45.088 --> 07:47.290
Good. Get in the car. Let's go.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.960
My Uncle Gary was just
trying to protect his family.

07:50.961 --> 07:53.897
My cousins are in elementary school.

07:53.898 --> 07:56.299
Hey, you know when the mob
finds out that Mia's still alive,

07:56.300 --> 07:57.702
we're all dead.

08:34.609 --> 08:36.010
You okay?

08:37.412 --> 08:39.145
You staying over again?

08:39.147 --> 08:41.884
I don't know. Sounds
like you kicking me out.

08:43.553 --> 08:45.554
Eli's got camp in the morning.

08:45.555 --> 08:48.223
Wait. Did I... Did I miss something?

08:48.224 --> 08:49.291
I thought we was connecting.

08:49.292 --> 08:53.162
Now you're treating me
like a one night stand.

08:53.163 --> 08:54.497
Eli's getting older, Marlon.

08:54.498 --> 08:56.499
I can't hide stuff from
him. Not like before.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.501
You ain't got to hide nothing from him.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.771
Do you see me ducking out of
here to make private phone calls?

09:00.772 --> 09:03.241
Or disappearing to take care of
business? I'm right here, with you.

09:06.511 --> 09:09.581
I just want to make sure that we're here,

09:09.582 --> 09:11.850
that we're really here,

09:11.851 --> 09:13.252
you're not gonna go back on your word.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.786
Babe.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.521
Come here.

09:16.522 --> 09:17.790
Come here.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.199
I'm not going back on my word.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.469
You think what I said to you was just

09:29.470 --> 09:31.471
to get inside your pants?

09:31.472 --> 09:33.874
- Didn't you?
- Hell, yeah.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.477
I had to.

09:38.413 --> 09:40.414
You keep saying things are
different, but I just...

09:40.415 --> 09:42.283
Nah, things aren't different.

09:42.284 --> 09:45.554
I'm the one who's
different since Talia died.

09:46.288 --> 09:48.891
And now? I want out of this life.

09:50.426 --> 09:53.563
I'm not doing this for
no one else except me.

09:55.098 --> 09:57.100
But you're doing a
little bit for me, right?

09:57.101 --> 10:00.169
Just a little bit for you.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.305
Well, what are you gonna
do for money, smart ass?

10:02.306 --> 10:03.440
Hmm...

10:04.041 --> 10:06.310
The DEA,

10:06.311 --> 10:09.513
they promised to unfreeze the store if...

10:09.514 --> 10:11.850
I landed them something big.

10:12.317 --> 10:13.985
And did you?

10:15.253 --> 10:16.855
The biggest.

10:16.856 --> 10:20.325
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm going downtown tomorrow

10:20.326 --> 10:22.261
to fill out the paperwork.

10:23.663 --> 10:25.531
- I like that.
- Hmm. You like that?

10:25.532 --> 10:27.934
- Mmm-hmm.
- All right.

10:27.935 --> 10:29.535
Where are you going?

10:29.536 --> 10:32.139
You know, Eli's got camp and all. So...

10:32.873 --> 10:34.542
Come here.

10:36.077 --> 10:37.945
- Just stay.
- You want me to stay?

10:37.946 --> 10:40.014
- Mmm.
- All right.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.351
Mmm.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.220
What do you know about Greg Barrett?

10:46.221 --> 10:48.089
I know that you should leave it alone.

10:48.090 --> 10:49.290
Marty ever mention him?

10:49.291 --> 10:50.758
What is wrong with you?

10:50.759 --> 10:51.826
Where do I start?

10:51.827 --> 10:53.829
You know, I'm not joking around.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.564
I know.

10:55.565 --> 10:57.299
You're adorable when you're serious.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.835
Marty Stein might as well be dead, okay?

10:59.836 --> 11:01.704
You got him. Two in the back of his skull,

11:01.705 --> 11:03.840
you tossed him out the building.

11:03.841 --> 11:05.709
Are you trying to turn me on, Patty?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.978
What more can you do to the man?

11:07.979 --> 11:10.513
You won.

11:10.514 --> 11:12.383
Why don't I feel celebratory?

11:12.384 --> 11:15.853
Because you're sick in the brain.

11:15.854 --> 11:18.255
Greg Barrett works at Deanston Finance.

11:18.256 --> 11:20.524
I got his name from Angelo Becerra.

11:20.525 --> 11:23.729
You put the screws to Angelo Becerra?

11:23.730 --> 11:25.330
The man owns half the city.

11:25.331 --> 11:27.065
And I think he's got a crush on me.

11:27.066 --> 11:29.334
His secretary sent me Bulls tickets

11:29.335 --> 11:30.402
for Saturday night.

11:30.403 --> 11:32.606
And you're proud of this?

11:33.474 --> 11:35.074
First thing, we talk to Barrett.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.809
Oh, now it's "We."

11:36.810 --> 11:38.544
Kind of has to be.

11:38.545 --> 11:39.813
I don't have a badge anymore.

11:43.084 --> 11:46.087
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. And no.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.089
No?

11:49.090 --> 11:52.027
Marty Stein has been
crucified by the media,

11:52.028 --> 11:53.628
his own law firm kicked him out.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.363
And what, you arrested him hours ago?

11:55.364 --> 11:57.232
He's already been released.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.967
Yeah, but are his assets still frozen?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.103
- Yeah.
- Then it's over for him.

12:01.104 --> 12:02.838
It's done. Period.

12:02.839 --> 12:05.775
- I want him in jail.
- You got to let this go, okay?

12:05.776 --> 12:07.777
This isn't healthy.

12:07.778 --> 12:10.313
Don't puss out on me, Finnegan.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.782
You said you were gonna help me out,

12:11.783 --> 12:14.051
prove what a good man
you are and all that shit.

12:14.052 --> 12:17.321
I said that? That doesn't sound like me.

12:23.529 --> 12:25.396
Tomorrow morning, I'm
going to Deanston Finance

12:25.397 --> 12:28.001
with or without you.

12:36.609 --> 12:38.412
Lock the door.

12:44.618 --> 12:46.353
Ethan, what the hell is going on?

12:46.354 --> 12:47.489
Nothing.

12:47.823 --> 12:49.690
Nothing?

12:49.691 --> 12:52.027
You haven't said a word
since we got back in the car.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.100
Look, I'm sorry. I fucked up, okay?

12:58.101 --> 13:00.635
- It's not that.
- Then what?

13:00.636 --> 13:03.305
Does the name Levsha
mean anything to you, Mia?

13:03.306 --> 13:05.242
No. Should it?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.447
Ethan, you're scaring the shit out of me.

13:11.448 --> 13:13.784
What did Jen say to you?

13:14.919 --> 13:17.388
We have to trust each other.

13:19.057 --> 13:21.526
There's a contract out on you.

13:27.199 --> 13:28.666
And Jen told you this?

13:28.667 --> 13:31.003
- Yeah.
- And you believe her?

13:32.671 --> 13:35.207
Gary Keyes is Jen's uncle.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.476
He's connected to the Russian mob.

13:37.344 --> 13:38.811
I don't understand this...

13:38.812 --> 13:41.213
- Okay, is there any other reason why...
- No.

13:41.214 --> 13:42.681
Mia, I really need you to think...

13:42.682 --> 13:45.218
No! I have no fucking idea, Ethan!

13:45.219 --> 13:46.754
Sit down.

13:50.158 --> 13:53.494
- Now, think Mia.
- It is the Russian mob, Ethan. I have no idea.

13:53.495 --> 13:55.630
Is it possible that you knew someone...

13:55.631 --> 13:58.166
I don't know what it has
anything to do with, Ethan...

13:58.167 --> 13:59.500
I'm telling you, I don't know!

13:59.501 --> 14:00.968
What about trades?

14:00.969 --> 14:02.971
Did you involve any of
the Russians with the...

14:02.972 --> 14:06.041
Oh, my God. Do you know how
many times I fucking did that?

14:06.042 --> 14:08.443
Do you know how many companies,
and how many people...

14:08.444 --> 14:10.312
I need you just to calm down.

14:10.313 --> 14:12.048
That's the only way we're
gonna fucking figure this out.

14:12.049 --> 14:14.851
You don't understand. There is
no figuring this out, Ethan...

14:14.852 --> 14:18.255
We have to get our stuff and
we have to go. We have to run.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.663
Mia, you can't run.

14:25.664 --> 14:26.997
I should have left a long time ago...

14:26.998 --> 14:28.999
I don't know why I stayed.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.017
Listen to me. Gary Keyes
was in witness protection

14:31.018 --> 14:31.918
and they got to him.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.072
You'll be running forever.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.275
Yeah, well, it's better
than the alternative.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.679
Please, please, Mia. Mia.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.282
Listen. If you want to
go, I won't stop you.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.017
But trust me, when I say to you,

14:45.018 --> 14:48.021
that everything catches
up with you in the end.

15:54.828 --> 15:58.565
Please rise. The court of
the second judicial circuit,

15:58.566 --> 16:00.902
criminal division, is now in session.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.182
- Any word?
- No.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.986
Without Agent Deakins' testimony
you don't stand a chance

16:16.987 --> 16:18.922
at getting your assets back.

16:20.057 --> 16:21.791
I'll request a continuance with the judge,

16:21.792 --> 16:24.395
but I don't have high
hopes he'll grant us one.

16:27.799 --> 16:29.200
Shit.

16:32.603 --> 16:33.938
Fuck, man.

16:35.674 --> 16:36.741
Jesus.

16:36.742 --> 16:39.478
Hang on.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.686
What are you doing here?

16:47.687 --> 16:49.889
Are we gonna do this through the door?

16:53.694 --> 16:55.428
How'd you find me?

16:55.429 --> 16:58.098
It wasn't that hard.

16:58.099 --> 17:00.367
Where were you at this morning? Huh?

17:00.368 --> 17:02.503
Court. You were supposed to testify.

17:02.504 --> 17:03.971
My assets. Did you forget?

17:03.972 --> 17:05.039
No, I didn't forget.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.640
What the fuck does that supposed mean?

17:06.641 --> 17:07.842
I can't help you right now.

17:07.843 --> 17:09.310
We had a deal.

17:09.310 --> 17:12.513
I know. And I feel like shit about
this, but I've been suspended.

17:12.515 --> 17:13.714
So what?

17:13.715 --> 17:15.851
So, I can't do anything.

17:15.852 --> 17:17.185
I'm sorry.

17:17.185 --> 17:18.520
That's some bullshit.

17:18.521 --> 17:20.123
It's temporary.

17:20.124 --> 17:22.925
- As soon as I'm back...
- Yeah, okay. I see how it is.

17:22.925 --> 17:25.461
You get yours and just
fuck everybody else, right?

17:25.462 --> 17:28.131
No, that is not how it is.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.534
Talk to my boss, Lowry. He
knows you played a big part in...

17:30.535 --> 17:33.604
A big part? I played
the whole fucking part!

17:33.605 --> 17:35.339
You wouldn't... All right.

17:35.340 --> 17:38.610
Talk to him. No promises.
But maybe he can help.

18:12.448 --> 18:13.849
Oh.

18:17.787 --> 18:18.921
Good morning.

18:19.255 --> 18:20.923
Morning.

18:25.128 --> 18:27.064
Listen...

18:28.599 --> 18:31.267
Last night shouldn't have happened.

18:31.268 --> 18:33.337
It was my fault, I
shouldn't have kissed you.

18:35.807 --> 18:37.342
I just...

18:40.212 --> 18:43.081
I don't know, I guess I just didn't
wanna think about anything for a second.

18:44.616 --> 18:47.552
Yeah. I understand.

18:47.553 --> 18:48.821
Did you make coffee?

18:49.555 --> 18:51.624
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

19:03.170 --> 19:06.907
So what do we do now?

19:06.908 --> 19:09.443
I was thinking about that. I'm gonna
call a guy that I think can help us.

19:09.444 --> 19:10.712
Yeah?

19:11.980 --> 19:13.982
Yeah, it's not a perfect
plan by far but, you know...

19:13.983 --> 19:15.583
Yeah, well you have to
start somewhere, right?

19:15.584 --> 19:17.252
Yeah.

19:19.722 --> 19:21.322
What?

19:21.323 --> 19:22.658
Do you want some pancakes?

19:22.659 --> 19:25.594
Is that what those are?

19:25.595 --> 19:28.398
Yeah, I mean, a little burned.

19:28.399 --> 19:29.732
But they're edible.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.867
Yeah, well, I'll take whatever
you're serving, I guess.

19:31.868 --> 19:35.139
Cooking is not one of my many talents.

19:36.807 --> 19:39.143
Well, you have others.

19:40.945 --> 19:42.680
I'm gonna get dressed.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.549
Yeah.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.616
Hey, Ethan.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.018
Yeah.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.088
I know you said it's all about the money.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.426
You helping me.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.295
And maybe it is.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.231
I know, it probably is...

19:59.232 --> 20:01.634
But in any case...

20:01.635 --> 20:04.104
I wanted to thank you.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.844
Well, don't thank me yet.

20:31.268 --> 20:33.069
You got a minute?

20:38.476 --> 20:40.011
Thanks for seeing me.

20:41.412 --> 20:43.680
All right.

20:43.681 --> 20:45.949
I know I mentioned, briefly on the phone

20:45.950 --> 20:48.219
what this was...

20:48.220 --> 20:50.088
I know why you're here.

20:50.089 --> 20:53.958
And let me preface by saying that
the deal you made with Agent Deakins,

20:53.959 --> 20:56.628
was made with Agent Deakins.

20:56.629 --> 20:58.097
As long as she's under investigation,

20:58.098 --> 21:00.499
I can't go near her cases.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.302
My hands are tied.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.307
I got you Marty Stein.

21:07.308 --> 21:11.578
Your assets were seized because
they were part of a large, ongoing

21:11.579 --> 21:13.046
criminal enterprise.

21:13.047 --> 21:14.781
I held up my end bargain of the.

21:14.782 --> 21:16.651
And as soon as Agent
Deakins is reinstated,

21:16.652 --> 21:19.720
I'm sure you'll be adequately
compensated for your efforts.

21:19.721 --> 21:21.389
No, man.

21:23.859 --> 21:26.062
I'm not supposed to be here.

21:27.730 --> 21:30.932
I'm not supposed to be here, man.

21:30.933 --> 21:33.735
Guys like me, who grew
up on these streets,

21:33.736 --> 21:37.340
we got an expiration date. You feel me?

21:37.341 --> 21:39.475
When you get to be my
age and you ain't done

21:39.476 --> 21:41.344
no real time jail time...

21:41.345 --> 21:43.346
You start to tell yourself, like,

21:43.347 --> 21:45.817
that while you doing this illegal shit...

21:48.420 --> 21:52.423
That at least you're on the better
side of the wrong side of crime.

21:52.424 --> 21:55.226
You know, you get yourself a nice house,

21:55.227 --> 21:57.495
nice business.

21:57.496 --> 21:59.764
Niggas start to forget

21:59.765 --> 22:02.167
about where all that money came from.

22:02.168 --> 22:03.703
But not me.

22:04.571 --> 22:07.307
I knew exactly how my bills got paid.

22:11.244 --> 22:13.380
You know, I came from the
same street as you did.

22:13.381 --> 22:15.182
I doubt that.

22:16.584 --> 22:18.519
I had this friend in middle school.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.388
Tucker.

22:21.389 --> 22:23.791
You know, he was that cat.

22:23.792 --> 22:25.526
There was nothing he wasn't good at.

22:25.527 --> 22:30.598
Sports, music, women,

22:30.599 --> 22:32.735
and we'd get up to all
kinds of trouble, you know...

22:32.736 --> 22:34.737
Petty shit, mostly.

22:34.738 --> 22:37.005
You know, we'd steal liquor
from a convenience store

22:37.006 --> 22:39.876
on 63rd street.

22:42.079 --> 22:43.947
You know, I'd distract the cashier

22:43.948 --> 22:45.415
by telling her I want to buy some smokes

22:45.416 --> 22:49.018
and he'd stick a bottle of
Mad Dog 20/20 up his shirt.

22:49.019 --> 22:53.290
I'm not really hearing how
this gets my asset back.

22:53.291 --> 22:57.962
So, one Friday, I shot my
mouth off, I got detention.

22:57.963 --> 23:01.166
And Tucker went to the store solo.

23:01.167 --> 23:04.903
You know, we were
supposed to catch up later.

23:04.904 --> 23:08.441
But that day, the convenience
store clerk call the cops.

23:11.979 --> 23:14.514
There was a standoff.

23:14.515 --> 23:18.987
They thought that the bottle of Mad Dog
that he had wrapped up in his jacket...

23:19.988 --> 23:21.789
Was a gun.

23:24.659 --> 23:27.128
Tucker took two in the back of the head.

23:32.268 --> 23:35.137
See, I ain't supposed
to be here either, man.

23:37.741 --> 23:39.676
Yeah. So...

23:44.014 --> 23:46.617
You're just telling me to walk away?

23:47.618 --> 23:51.888
I'm saying you're young. You're healthy.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.024
You're breathing. You need money.

23:54.025 --> 23:55.826
Do what the rest of us do.

23:57.496 --> 23:59.031
What's that?

24:01.099 --> 24:02.634
Get a job.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.109
Detective Finnegan. Agent Deakins.

24:11.110 --> 24:12.578
We're here to talk to Greg Barrett.

24:12.579 --> 24:15.315
I'll just grab my boss. One moment.

24:17.117 --> 24:18.852
Place has a bit of a morose vibe.

24:18.853 --> 24:21.788
They work in finance.
Basically, the gates of hell.

24:21.789 --> 24:23.457
Who pissed in your cornflakes?

24:28.730 --> 24:30.064
You're here about Greg?

24:30.065 --> 24:31.932
Yeah, that's right.

24:31.933 --> 24:33.802
We told the other detectives everything.

24:33.803 --> 24:36.338
- What detectives?
- From homicide.

24:36.339 --> 24:38.073
Homicide?

24:38.074 --> 24:39.875
Greg was murdered three days ago.

24:41.944 --> 24:43.946
We seem to be playing a
little bit of catch-up here.

24:43.947 --> 24:45.548
Did they say what happened?

24:45.549 --> 24:46.883
We didn't get details,

24:46.884 --> 24:50.086
just that he was found in
his apartment by a neighbor.

24:50.087 --> 24:52.756
I'm gonna need Greg Barrett's address.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.559
Can you tell us about his
recent business activity?

24:55.560 --> 24:57.027
Excuse me?

24:57.028 --> 24:59.696
What he was working on? Who he
was involved with day to day?

24:59.697 --> 25:02.367
I'm sorry, what department
are you with again?

25:02.368 --> 25:04.769
Chicago police force. Major crimes.

25:04.770 --> 25:08.506
Right. Well, I've already
made a statement on the matter.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.707
I'm sure your colleagues

25:09.708 --> 25:11.710
will be happy to fill you in.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.913
Thank you very much.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.716
Thank you very much.

25:27.461 --> 25:28.796
Why do I suddenly feel like

25:28.797 --> 25:30.998
this is Hutchings all over again?

25:31.199 --> 25:32.266
Peters.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.402
Hey! Finnegan. What's going on, man?

25:34.403 --> 25:35.736
How you doing, there?

25:35.737 --> 25:37.471
Hey, this is Harper
Deakins, gang taskforce.

25:37.472 --> 25:39.206
- How you doing?
- What happened in there?

25:39.207 --> 25:41.076
Well, some real nasty, medieval shit.

25:41.077 --> 25:42.411
How's that?

25:42.412 --> 25:44.146
They tortured that poor son
of a bitch something fierce.

25:44.147 --> 25:46.281
- No kidding...
- I mean, some over-privileged,

25:46.282 --> 25:48.951
ass-crack in finance gets
his fingernails ripped out...

25:48.952 --> 25:50.153
I'm not shedding any tears

25:50.154 --> 25:52.155
but it is a shitty way to go.

25:52.156 --> 25:53.890
We think this murder is
connected to another case...

25:53.891 --> 25:55.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:55.225 --> 25:56.693
You need to talk to Grady and Delsanto

25:56.694 --> 25:58.161
'cause they're running primary on this.

25:58.162 --> 25:59.897
- Oh, come on. You serious?
- Yeah, brother.

25:59.898 --> 26:02.233
Yeah, man, for real. They are.

26:02.834 --> 26:04.301
Christ!

26:04.302 --> 26:07.438
- All right, man.
- All right, bro, take care.

26:17.918 --> 26:19.919
- See that shit?
- Can we get back to the car

26:19.920 --> 26:21.253
before you start Marty Steining?

26:21.254 --> 26:23.389
No. That.

26:23.390 --> 26:25.859
You think your boys grabbed the footage?

26:26.860 --> 26:28.930
Put in a call to Delsanto.

26:34.202 --> 26:36.270
- Oh...
- Oh...

26:37.139 --> 26:38.606
Lucky, man!

26:38.607 --> 26:41.275
- Just like something...
- Give it again...

26:41.276 --> 26:43.212
Do it again, huh!

26:43.946 --> 26:45.882
Oh, yes.

26:48.485 --> 26:50.085
Hey!

26:50.086 --> 26:53.890
Go in there. Fire up that Xbox.
I'll be in there in a second.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.494
Cute kid, Marlon.

26:58.496 --> 26:59.963
What...

26:59.964 --> 27:01.164
Marty sent you?

27:01.165 --> 27:03.700
No, I came own my own.

27:03.701 --> 27:05.569
Well, his mom will be home soon.

27:05.570 --> 27:07.505
Oh, this will only take a minute.

27:09.441 --> 27:11.308
What, Marty tell you, where to find me?

27:11.309 --> 27:14.379
What do you mean? You
work for me, remember?

27:14.380 --> 27:16.782
This address was on the court paperwork.

27:16.783 --> 27:18.650
Well, so is my cell.

27:18.651 --> 27:20.652
Why don't you call me next time.
I don't like these drop-ins.

27:20.653 --> 27:22.654
Well, I need some help.

27:22.655 --> 27:24.524
And you came to me?

27:24.525 --> 27:26.793
Look, I'm looking for a
guy by the name of Levsha.

27:26.794 --> 27:27.994
Russian mob.

27:29.196 --> 27:31.330
What do I look? Eastern European to you?

27:33.201 --> 27:35.803
I just thought maybe you'd come
across his name, over the years.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.005
No, I haven't.

27:38.006 --> 27:40.541
Maybe you have a
contact. Someone that did.

27:40.542 --> 27:42.409
What do you think, my
contacts just meet with a guy,

27:42.410 --> 27:43.679
'cause I tell him to?

27:44.280 --> 27:46.147
Doesn't work that way.

27:46.148 --> 27:48.350
Well, I need an in, Marlon.

27:50.286 --> 27:52.956
There's this bar on Grantham.

27:52.957 --> 27:54.957
The Iron Mule.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.025
Either your guy drinks there,

27:56.026 --> 27:58.094
or he knows everyone who does.

27:58.695 --> 27:59.963
Thanks.

28:30.197 --> 28:31.665
Whoa,

28:31.666 --> 28:32.866
I'm sorry, sorry...

28:37.805 --> 28:40.074
Excuse me, bartender.
Can I get three shots

28:40.075 --> 28:43.211
of vodka, please, if you don't mind?

28:47.549 --> 28:49.352
Come on...

28:50.219 --> 28:52.754
- Here...
- Right.

28:52.755 --> 28:55.224
Two and...

28:56.092 --> 28:57.292
Please.

28:57.293 --> 28:59.629
(Sirsty...

29:02.366 --> 29:03.432
Suka...

29:03.433 --> 29:04.835
Huh?

29:05.569 --> 29:07.036
Suka, huh?

29:07.037 --> 29:10.107
Yeah. Suka... suka, suka, suka...

29:10.108 --> 29:11.975
You know what...

29:11.976 --> 29:13.710
This is for her boss.

29:13.711 --> 29:16.047
Yeah. Fucking boss.

29:20.386 --> 29:21.787
Yeah...

29:24.390 --> 29:28.595
And this is to her scuba instructor...

29:29.729 --> 29:30.864
Now...

29:34.534 --> 29:36.070
Sorry.

29:36.671 --> 29:38.339
I'm sorry.

29:40.007 --> 29:41.275
And this one here...

29:43.344 --> 29:45.346
Yeah. This is for my brother.

29:45.347 --> 29:48.416
That fucking whore. That fucking bitch.

29:48.417 --> 29:51.219
- What's her name? What's her name?
- Huh?

29:51.220 --> 29:53.088
Natalia, that's her name.

29:53.089 --> 29:55.290
Oh, Natalia. Russian?

29:55.491 --> 29:57.293
Mitya.

29:58.027 --> 29:59.361
- Oh.
- You know what.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.630
Let me tell you something.

30:02.165 --> 30:04.300
I gave her fucking everything.

30:04.301 --> 30:07.503
I gave her everything and she still...

30:07.504 --> 30:09.906
You see that. That's your mistake.

30:09.907 --> 30:12.976
For Russian women, it's about respect.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.113
- What do you mean?
- You give them too much...

30:15.114 --> 30:16.981
They fuck your brother.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.983
Yes.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.118
- They fuck your brother.
- I like you.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.456
- Huh?
- You're my new friend. I like your attitude.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.591
Two more, hey big boy!

30:26.592 --> 30:27.926
Two more.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.729
Yeah, okay.

30:30.730 --> 30:32.999
Another one, huh! Oh, look at that!

30:33.000 --> 30:36.068
My babushka, she tell me...

30:36.069 --> 30:37.270
- How much we got?
- Over and over...

30:37.271 --> 30:38.871
Fifty bucks.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.740
"Evgengi, why do always you eat?"

30:40.741 --> 30:44.878
- "Evgengi, why you not sexy like when you are young?"
- Thank you.

30:44.879 --> 30:48.081
"Evgengi, why stomach so big and...

30:48.082 --> 30:50.952
penis so small?"

30:52.221 --> 30:54.756
And one time, one time,

30:54.757 --> 30:57.292
- I buy her dress that is wrong size...
- So small...

30:57.293 --> 30:58.893
She throw me out of house.

30:58.894 --> 31:00.495
- Threw you out of the house?
- Oh!

31:00.496 --> 31:01.697
My wife would let you in.

31:03.433 --> 31:05.034
Get rid of this.

31:05.035 --> 31:07.569
Get rid of this, sloth.

31:07.570 --> 31:09.038
What's her number?

31:11.043 --> 31:13.043
Mitya...

31:13.044 --> 31:14.578
I have a favor...

31:16.113 --> 31:19.182
My wife was texting someone,

31:19.183 --> 31:21.719
- from this place.
- Oh.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.055
His name is Levsha. Know who he is?

31:27.059 --> 31:29.061
Trust me, leave it alone.

31:29.062 --> 31:30.796
Leave it alone, what do you mean?

31:30.797 --> 31:31.863
Who is he?

31:31.864 --> 31:33.465
Vasily Anatov.

31:33.466 --> 31:36.268
You're always running over the mouth.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.805
Listen, Ethan...

31:38.806 --> 31:41.008
This is not a guy you want to fuck with.

31:41.742 --> 31:43.343
Seriously.

31:43.344 --> 31:45.211
- You understand what I'm telling you.
- Yeah, I am.

31:45.212 --> 31:47.347
So, let's drink more

31:47.348 --> 31:49.483
and tomorrow...

31:49.484 --> 31:52.820
You will forget about all of this.

31:52.821 --> 31:56.824
Na Zdorovie! Na Zdorovie!

31:56.825 --> 31:57.960
I got a name.

31:58.427 --> 31:59.761
Vasily Anatov.

31:59.762 --> 32:02.697
A-N-A-T-O-V.

32:02.698 --> 32:04.299
How did it go?

32:04.300 --> 32:07.770
These fuckers can drink.

32:07.771 --> 32:11.374
Okay. 1255 Merrigold Lane.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.443
All right, thanks.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.549
Come on, turn around.

33:37.470 --> 33:38.670
Can I help you?

33:38.671 --> 33:40.072
Yeah, is Marlon around?

33:41.341 --> 33:44.344
- Mar? Door.
- All right.

33:54.021 --> 33:56.423
Was I not fucking clear when I
told you to call me next time?

33:56.424 --> 33:58.692
You know that tip gave me, it checked out.

33:58.693 --> 34:00.428
Good for you, man.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.430
I need your help on something, Marlon.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.498
I've been about as charitable

34:03.499 --> 34:05.233
as I plan to be with you, bro.

34:05.234 --> 34:06.701
I just need a little muscle, Marlon.

34:06.702 --> 34:09.036
Did you not hear me? I
said the answer is no.

34:09.772 --> 34:10.907
No?

34:11.641 --> 34:13.375
Hey! You owe me.

34:13.376 --> 34:15.643
- How is that?
- I vouched for you in court.

34:15.645 --> 34:17.380
I put you on my payroll.

34:17.380 --> 34:18.580
If it wasn't for me,

34:18.581 --> 34:20.183
your ass would be sitting in jail.

34:20.184 --> 34:22.318
No, that's the deal you
made with Marty, not me, bro.

34:22.319 --> 34:24.053
You know what I wonder?

34:24.054 --> 34:26.456
I wonder how your probation
officer would react

34:26.456 --> 34:28.056
if I told him that you
never came in to work.

34:28.058 --> 34:30.194
You come over here
looking for muscle, man?

34:30.195 --> 34:32.329
You really think it's a
good idea to threaten me?

34:35.934 --> 34:38.069
Marlon, everything okay?

34:38.070 --> 34:39.804
Yeah, baby.

34:39.804 --> 34:40.940
Just about done.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.552
Hmm. She's beautiful.

34:55.688 --> 34:57.024
You think she'll hang around

34:57.025 --> 34:58.693
if you go back to prison?

35:01.563 --> 35:04.565
So, I imagine this has to do with
the name I gave you earlier, right?

35:04.766 --> 35:07.067
Yeah.

35:09.171 --> 35:11.039
Greg Barrett was an MIT grad.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.774
Single, no kids.

35:12.775 --> 35:15.311
Plays golf with his buddies
from the office every Sunday.

35:15.312 --> 35:17.713
Hasn't had so much as a
speeding ticket in five years.

35:17.714 --> 35:19.181
That's not a lot to go on.

35:19.182 --> 35:21.984
Usually it's an overdose
with these guys. Coke, heroin.

35:21.985 --> 35:23.852
But nothing like this.

35:23.853 --> 35:25.455
- What else?
- I've been looking into his clients a little bit.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.057
But nothing to raise any flags.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.925
What about this?

35:28.926 --> 35:31.194
Looks like he's been making
a lot of trades with Stein.

35:31.195 --> 35:32.662
All on the up-and-up.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.532
Most of them pretty damn lucrative too.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.801
But nothing that would
bring on this kind of wrath.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.669
Obviously you don't know the guy...

35:38.670 --> 35:43.341
- Any hits on fingerprints?
- Lab's still out, probably be another couple of days.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.877
What about credit cards? Unusual
purchases, that sort of thing?

35:45.878 --> 35:48.814
No, nothing to suggest
Barrett was into anything.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.349
Then how do you explain this?

35:51.484 --> 35:52.684
Pissed someone off.

35:52.685 --> 35:54.153
No. That's not what
"pissed off" looks like.

35:54.154 --> 35:55.488
"Pissed off" is a nine to the chest.

35:55.489 --> 35:57.890
This is something entirely different.

35:57.891 --> 36:01.094
This is professional. It is clinical.

36:01.095 --> 36:03.097
It's someone who wants information.

36:03.098 --> 36:05.499
Probably just should've given it to him.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.302
This is the security camera
footage from the lobby

36:08.303 --> 36:10.638
of Greg Barrett' building.

36:19.649 --> 36:20.982
Wait.

36:20.983 --> 36:21.985
Go back.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.991
Okay. Stop. Play there.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.729
Freeze it.

36:33.665 --> 36:35.666
Holy shit!

36:35.667 --> 36:36.801
Who's that?

36:37.535 --> 36:39.536
That is Ethan Kelly.

36:39.537 --> 36:40.806
That name is supposed to mean something?

36:43.008 --> 36:45.009
It means Marty Stein's involved.

36:45.010 --> 36:47.479
That's what that means.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.635
I'm looking for Vasily.

37:08.235 --> 37:09.371
There.

37:28.926 --> 37:30.861
Sit, sweetheart.

37:32.129 --> 37:34.197
Come...

37:37.202 --> 37:38.603
Hmm.

37:39.871 --> 37:41.940
What is your name?

37:48.280 --> 37:50.133
Well, you can come
here, you know who I am,

37:50.134 --> 37:51.467
but I cannot know who you are?

37:52.685 --> 37:54.152
It's Jennifer.

37:54.153 --> 37:55.956
It's Jennifer.

37:56.957 --> 37:58.290
Hmm...

37:58.291 --> 38:00.226
Gary's my uncle.

38:03.897 --> 38:06.767
Your uncle is not answering my calls.

38:07.568 --> 38:09.568
My uncle's dead.

38:13.669 --> 38:16.866
Well, this is very brave then
of you to come here like this.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.782
- I didn't have a choice.
- No?

38:21.517 --> 38:23.051
Look...

38:25.388 --> 38:27.790
I know what he promised you.

38:27.791 --> 38:30.793
I know what your agreement was.

38:32.328 --> 38:33.797
Hmm.

38:33.798 --> 38:35.665
What's it about, Jennifer?

38:35.666 --> 38:37.400
Hmm?

38:37.401 --> 38:38.868
You've come here to
make another arrangement?

38:38.869 --> 38:40.404
I know where Mia is.

38:42.874 --> 38:44.208
Good.

38:44.209 --> 38:46.745
Then you tell me when she is dead.

38:46.746 --> 38:49.547
No, I can't. That's...

38:49.548 --> 38:50.815
"I can't... "

38:52.485 --> 38:54.352
Get out, huh!

38:54.353 --> 38:57.690
- You're wasting my time, go.
- Look. Please...

38:57.691 --> 39:00.492
I'll give you the address.
Can you send somebody else?

39:00.493 --> 39:03.162
I lost my dad. I lost
my uncle... I don't...

39:04.364 --> 39:06.433
I won't want to lose
the rest of my family.

39:13.441 --> 39:14.842
Okay.

39:17.312 --> 39:21.383
Okay, okay. Jennifer,
Jenny from the block here.

39:22.918 --> 39:25.921
You write down the address, right here.

39:30.794 --> 39:32.462
Okay.

39:36.266 --> 39:37.934
Okay, Jennifer.

39:40.938 --> 39:42.539
Okay.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.342
Bravo. Thank you very much. That's...

39:45.343 --> 39:47.812
That's very helpful.

39:48.813 --> 39:50.548
So...

39:50.549 --> 39:53.618
Barrett's assistant says that Ethan
and Greg, they knew each other.

39:53.619 --> 39:55.802
Apparently, Ethan went into the office

39:55.803 --> 39:57.425
and caused some shit a couple of days

39:57.489 --> 39:58.423
before Greg was found.

39:58.424 --> 39:59.692
What the hell is that?

40:01.494 --> 40:02.828
What?

40:02.829 --> 40:04.563
You stole the fucking file?

40:04.564 --> 40:06.365
It's not like they're
doing anything with it.

40:08.836 --> 40:10.436
Do you know what this is?

40:10.437 --> 40:12.038
This is an addiction.

40:12.039 --> 40:13.239
You are an addict.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.108
You're a Marty Stein junkie.

40:15.109 --> 40:18.045
You think Ethan Kelly just showed
up in that apartment by accident?

40:18.046 --> 40:20.981
Wait for the lab to bring
back the fingerprints.

40:20.982 --> 40:23.250
If they're his, he's in the
system. We will nail him.

40:23.251 --> 40:25.920
I've done this dance too many times.

40:25.971 --> 40:28.506
That guy is careful. There's
no way he left fingerprints.

40:28.507 --> 40:30.042
So then what?

40:31.177 --> 40:35.180
You... Have to go talk to Marty Stein.

40:35.181 --> 40:37.316
And say what?

40:37.317 --> 40:40.119
Fish around. Pretend like
you're a fucking detective.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.988
If I go to Marty and I
start asking about Ethan,

40:41.989 --> 40:44.123
he's gonna know something's up.

40:44.124 --> 40:47.327
Okay, so don't ask questions,
give him what he's paying for.

40:47.328 --> 40:48.662
He's not paying for shit anymore.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.464
His assets are frozen, thanks to you.

40:51.332 --> 40:53.734
For old time's sake.

40:53.735 --> 40:57.205
Tell him you caught Barrett's
murder, about the security footage.

40:57.206 --> 40:58.673
About Kelly.

40:58.674 --> 41:03.412
I don't think Marty Stein
has anything to do with this.

41:04.013 --> 41:05.148
Patty.

41:06.016 --> 41:08.417
We are going to get him.

41:08.418 --> 41:11.754
We're gonna wind up like Barrett.

41:11.755 --> 41:15.292
If you don't have the balls, just say it.

41:26.304 --> 41:29.441
Call me as soon as you're
done talking to him.

41:59.541 --> 42:00.942
Where you going?

42:01.811 --> 42:03.011
Hey, little man.

42:03.012 --> 42:04.879
I'm going out just for a little bit.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.015
- Can I come?
- No.

42:07.016 --> 42:09.684
Go back to bed. And don't wake your mom.

42:09.685 --> 42:11.087
She needs her sleep.

42:11.555 --> 42:12.956
Okay.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.713
He'll see you now.

42:43.723 --> 42:44.991
Thanks for seeing me.

44:17.694 --> 44:19.561
Patty.

44:19.562 --> 44:23.967
Where are you? I told you to call
me as soon as you left Marty's.

44:23.968 --> 44:26.903
Give me a call, it
doesn't matter how late.

44:26.904 --> 44:28.172
Oh God.

44:36.114 --> 44:37.982
Wake up, Vasily.

44:37.983 --> 44:39.517
It's time to talk.

44:41.988 --> 44:43.389
Who hired you?

44:43.990 --> 44:45.257
Hmm?

44:47.059 --> 44:49.395
Who hired you, Vasily?

44:56.270 --> 44:57.870
Hey, look at me.

44:57.871 --> 44:59.872
Who's behind this?

44:59.873 --> 45:02.076
Who's behind this?

45:03.077 --> 45:04.811
What do you want with Mia?

45:04.812 --> 45:06.280
Why are you after her? Mmm?

45:06.281 --> 45:07.614
Is that the best you've got?

45:07.615 --> 45:08.815
No, no, no. I'm just getting started.

45:08.816 --> 45:10.285
It's just a little bit of pain.

45:10.286 --> 45:12.420
- Mmm-hmm.
- You're a soldier, yes?

45:12.421 --> 45:15.089
- Yeah.
- Iraq or Afghanistan?

45:15.090 --> 45:16.424
Fuck you.

45:16.425 --> 45:18.293
I was in war, too.

45:18.294 --> 45:19.762
Chechnya.

45:19.763 --> 45:21.497
Well, I don't give a shit about your war.

45:21.498 --> 45:24.566
You think I don't know
your type? You play at war.

45:24.567 --> 45:26.835
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:29.373 --> 45:31.508
Stay with me. Stay with me.

45:36.180 --> 45:37.448
Okay.

45:41.653 --> 45:43.254
You know what, Vasily?

45:43.255 --> 45:45.389
If you don't tell me

45:45.390 --> 45:47.124
what I wanna fuckin' know,

45:47.125 --> 45:49.661
you're gonna be here a
long, long fuckin' time.

45:49.662 --> 45:52.731
And I can be here all day and all night.

45:52.732 --> 45:54.466
Compared to what we did in Chechnya,

45:54.467 --> 45:58.672
you are not shit, you
fucking American pussy.

46:02.076 --> 46:05.678
You're gonna be lickin' this fuckin'
American boot when I'm done with you.

46:05.679 --> 46:07.014
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

46:07.015 --> 46:09.283
Start talkin'.

46:09.284 --> 46:10.818
Why don't you give me a shot?

46:12.487 --> 46:14.088
I thought you didn't do this anymore.

46:14.089 --> 46:15.490
I don't.

46:16.092 --> 46:17.226
Mmm.

46:27.437 --> 46:28.838
Patty?

46:34.378 --> 46:36.246
- Lily.
- I'm sorry...

46:36.247 --> 46:37.848
I know it's late, I just, I had to...

46:37.849 --> 46:39.449
No, what? What's wrong?

46:39.450 --> 46:42.987
Patrick didn't come home.
Nobody knows where he is.

46:55.335 --> 46:56.736
You know who I am?

46:58.938 --> 47:01.274
Mmm. Let me guess.

47:02.809 --> 47:04.745
You're a loud-mouth nigger.

47:05.479 --> 47:07.347
Don't be disrespectful.

47:10.151 --> 47:12.553
This is a favorite spot of mine, actually.

47:12.554 --> 47:14.955
Yeah? Well, you have
terrible taste in spots.

47:14.956 --> 47:18.559
Oh, you're only saying that because
this is your first time here.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.828
Well, let me show you around a little bit,

47:20.829 --> 47:22.632
before you make up your mind.

47:24.567 --> 47:26.034
See, I spent my formative years here

47:26.035 --> 47:27.703
getting an education.

47:28.438 --> 47:30.172
My ma, God bless her.

47:30.173 --> 47:32.175
Always said that a man needs a trade.

47:36.180 --> 47:39.382
Lucky for me, I got pretty good at it.

47:39.383 --> 47:41.586
And you know what I
learned from this place?

47:43.121 --> 47:46.124
How to tie someone like you in a chair.

47:46.858 --> 47:49.594
Pour gasoline all over them.

47:51.130 --> 47:53.932
Then, light a match.

47:53.933 --> 47:56.535
And then...

47:58.337 --> 48:01.273
But see, that was the old me.

48:01.274 --> 48:03.877
I found myself recently at a crossroads.

48:05.011 --> 48:07.146
I keep tellin' myself,

48:07.147 --> 48:08.882
that part of my life is over, you know?

48:08.883 --> 48:11.085
And maybe it is, maybe it ain't.

48:14.622 --> 48:18.292
Sorry to say, it's behind you
until you're faced with it.

48:31.307 --> 48:34.043
Mmm-mmm. Now see...

48:37.046 --> 48:40.718
Today's been a little bit of a scramble.

48:42.653 --> 48:45.122
So we don't have a lot of time.

48:48.527 --> 48:52.663
Now, otherwise...

48:52.664 --> 48:54.665
I will show you what
this place really can do.

49:03.609 --> 49:06.012
My apologies on that.

49:06.013 --> 49:08.081
I guess I'm gonna have
to give you the dime tour.

49:11.084 --> 49:13.019
Now my friend has a question,

49:14.154 --> 49:18.292
and I'm gonna have him
ask you one last time.

49:18.293 --> 49:21.228
Then, I'm gonna light you on fire.

49:21.229 --> 49:24.900
And watch your skin melt right
off your little commie face.

49:25.768 --> 49:27.635
Ethan.

49:27.636 --> 49:29.438
Ask this gentleman your question.

49:30.706 --> 49:32.107
Who sent you?

49:32.441 --> 49:33.977
Mmm...

49:36.446 --> 49:37.646
I was hoping you'd say that.

49:37.647 --> 49:38.915
Marty Stein.

49:40.050 --> 49:41.184
What?

49:45.389 --> 49:46.791
What did you say?

49:47.925 --> 49:50.528
Marty Stein sent me.
