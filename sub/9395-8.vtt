01:42.942 --> 01:44.335
That’s gonna leave a mark.

01:45.912 --> 01:47.771
So what am I doing here?

01:48.077 --> 01:51.031
Brooke, that’s two weekends in a row you don’t remember what happened the night before.

01:51.524 --> 01:54.484
Oh, please tell me I didn’t make a fool of myself with Lucas.

01:55.185 --> 01:56.828
Nope, that would be me.

01:57.124 --> 01:59.369
Wait. You two were totally hot for each other.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.213
Were.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.577
Until about halfway through ripping each other’s clothes off I bailed.

02:03.767 --> 02:07.002
- Because?
- Because he got all serious.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.080
He was talking about this intense commitment or I don’t know.

02:11.507 --> 02:15.283
I don’t want to live in a world where two fine and willing girls like ourselves

02:15.383 --> 02:17.411
can have such a lame Friday night.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.160
I gotta change my karma.

02:21.662 --> 02:23.408
Maybe you should make some changes too.

02:23.849 --> 02:25.804
I didn’t wake up with a foggy memory.

02:25.993 --> 02:27.806
Well, you didn’t wake up with Lucas, either.

02:32.288 --> 02:34.965
Luke, did you ever hear of a UHF or their SARA?

02:35.378 --> 02:38.600
Yeah, UHF. They’re from Portland, right? They’re good.

02:38.717 --> 02:40.428
Um, but with SARA, they’re great.

02:40.592 --> 02:41.416
Cool

02:46.156 --> 02:46.905
You okay?

02:48.252 --> 02:49.307
Yeah, I can handle it.

02:53.265 --> 02:55.548
I called your house. Your mom said you're here.

02:55.701 --> 02:57.329
Crap. I should lie to her next time.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.895
Look, I didn’t know until Brooke read that note, okay?

02:59.926 --> 03:01.796
I didn’t even know there was a note until later.

03:02.509 --> 03:03.791
I wouldn’t do that to you.

03:05.911 --> 03:06.675
Okay.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.247
Great, so…

03:08.953 --> 03:09.793
cool?

03:10.183 --> 03:11.257
No, no.

03:11.881 --> 03:14.493
- Well, you believe me, right?
- Yeah, I believe you’re sorry.

03:14.688 --> 03:15.544
Well then, what…

03:15.927 --> 03:18.969
Look, this whole tutoring, hanging out, whatever it is, thing.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.669
It’s just a bad idea. I’m done. I’m just done.

03:32.548 --> 03:35.158
So explain to me how this fixes your karma again.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.411
It doesn’t but it’s a total pick me up, don’t you think?

03:37.708 --> 03:39.230
Now, try this on.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.980
Now the karma thing comes next.

03:45.313 --> 03:49.727
I figured out a master plan. If I can fix the damage I’ve done to certain people’s love lives,

03:49.778 --> 03:51.739
maybe the universe will kick in and fix mine.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.494
Pretty long list.

03:53.556 --> 03:57.166
Yeah, and Nathan and Haley are at the top of it. I screwed them over royally last night.

03:57.995 --> 03:59.798
Double karma points if I can undo that one.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.054
Fabulous!

04:03.566 --> 04:06.035
You know not everybody can pull off the sceezy in the jungle vibe.

04:06.106 --> 04:07.478
Now I can fix you up to.

04:07.761 --> 04:11.555
No thanks. I am done with the drama of dating. I just wanna have fun.

04:11.769 --> 04:14.673
Then you’ll be happy to know that I got us invited to a party at Duke tonight.

04:15.185 --> 04:17.571
So much for you changing your ways.

04:17.642 --> 04:22.858
What? You promised to have fun, and I promised to indulge in boys, not booze.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.913
And now we have something to wear.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.432
My omelet was perfect, Karen.

04:31.502 --> 04:32.639
Oh, thanks.

04:33.532 --> 04:34.621
And it’s on the house.

04:34.995 --> 04:38.487
It gives me an opportunity to repay you for your hospitality last night.

04:38.548 --> 04:40.377
Oh, not necessary, I had fun.

04:40.815 --> 04:43.014
Gotta love the mail service.

04:47.744 --> 04:48.785
Is everything okay?

04:48.876 --> 04:52.783
I just um, I had applied to this amazing cooking circle in Florence

04:52.844 --> 04:54.560
and they just had a last minute opening.

04:54.703 --> 04:56.532
Oh, well congratulations.

04:56.659 --> 04:58.728
I’ve not even been waitlisted before.

05:01.156 --> 05:03.762
Wait a minute. Six weeks in Italy?

05:04.427 --> 05:08.283
- Aren’t you excited?
- Starts next week. It’s not like I can go.

05:08.406 --> 05:11.493
- Then, why did you apply?
- As a lark.

05:11.793 --> 05:14.847
It’s just not a good time with Lucas and the café.

05:15.134 --> 05:17.402
It’s the opportunity of a lifetime.

05:17.986 --> 05:22.189
Yeah, well, I guess it will have to wait until some other lifetime.

05:30.858 --> 05:32.162
What do you want, Brooke?

05:33.290 --> 05:34.381
To apologize.

05:35.447 --> 05:37.099
For what I did to you. You and Haley.

05:38.012 --> 05:39.101
You’re apologizing?

05:39.275 --> 05:40.709
Yeah, I know. Kinda weird, right?

05:41.098 --> 05:44.974
But I’m trying to appease the gods so… I’m sorry.

05:45.998 --> 05:50.075
Whatever. *** for drunken high school girls sick, so…

05:50.597 --> 05:52.072
Okay, I totally had that coming.

05:53.417 --> 05:57.222
I want you to know I’m going to fix it. Get you and Haley back on track.

05:57.576 --> 05:58.589
Not gonna happen.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.248
She made that pretty clear this morning.

06:02.347 --> 06:04.842
Leave it to me. What do you want to do on your date?

06:06.457 --> 06:07.355
What date?

06:08.052 --> 06:11.191
Never mind. No time to waste. I’ll call you later with details.

06:17.770 --> 06:18.774
What’s with the boxes?

06:19.286 --> 06:21.933
Oh, bookshelves. And they were supposed to come assembled.

06:22.559 --> 06:24.407
You gonna put them together all by yourself?

06:24.524 --> 06:27.627
Actually, I was going to offer you dinner to help me.

06:29.228 --> 06:29.952
Sold.

06:30.795 --> 06:34.703
Perfect. I’ll be closing the café around seven. So it’s a date?

06:35.483 --> 06:36.449
It’s a date.

06:43.793 --> 06:45.353
We’re closed.

06:47.705 --> 06:52.942
Oh, I get it. Closed to me. I don’t blame you. I’d be a bitch to me to after last night.

06:53.965 --> 06:55.615
Knock yourself out.

06:57.499 --> 07:00.622
You’re feisty. I see what Nathan likes about you.

07:02.241 --> 07:05.792
Look, you’re blaming Nathan for something that I did and that’s not fair.

07:06.254 --> 07:11.292
Okay, I was drunk and I was pissed and I found your note and you know the rest…

07:13.336 --> 07:14.769
I want to make it up to you.

07:15.366 --> 07:16.352
By going away?

07:16.823 --> 07:19.040
By hooking you and Nathan up tonight.

07:19.696 --> 07:21.206
What’s your idea of a perfect date?

07:21.457 --> 07:23.075
Watching you get hit by a bus.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.888
And that sense of humor…

07:25.231 --> 07:26.545
Nathan’s really lucky.

07:27.545 --> 07:29.619
He’ll be here at 7. Have fun.

07:36.746 --> 07:41.580
Bonjourno. I am Marcello Vivari of the Genoculudidian Institute in Florence.

07:41.774 --> 07:45.206
- I call for Seniorina Karen Roe.
- When’s that ‘do not call list’ kick in?

07:45.277 --> 07:47.406
Excuse me, but we haven’t heard from you.

07:47.502 --> 07:51.646
We sent a letter inviting you to start next week and, we haven’t heard a word

07:51.719 --> 07:54.221
so would you be call enough to call me back.

07:55.097 --> 07:56.874
Isn’t that that school you’ve been talking about forever?

07:57.319 --> 07:58.037
Yeah…

07:58.698 --> 07:59.706
Mom, that’s great!

08:00.551 --> 08:03.623
It’s no big deal. I’m not gonna go.

08:04.555 --> 08:07.370
It is a big deal, Mom. Come on, it’s a huge deal.

08:08.419 --> 08:10.669
Well maybe I’ll just go some other time.

08:10.746 --> 08:12.702
No, Mom. Now’s the time.

08:13.254 --> 08:15.174
Come on, you’ve put your whole life on hold for me.

08:15.568 --> 08:17.207
Every choice you’ve made has been about me.

08:17.443 --> 08:19.532
That’s the way it’s supposed to be. I’m your mother.

08:19.587 --> 08:21.021
And I want you to have this.

08:21.989 --> 08:23.586
It’s time for you to do something for yourself.

08:24.888 --> 08:26.060
I’ll think about it.

08:26.188 --> 08:27.238
Don’t think about it, Mom.

08:28.179 --> 08:28.974
Do it.

08:43.222 --> 08:47.244
We’re young, we’re fun. Lets do some damage.

08:48.717 --> 08:50.045
Want some while it lasts?

08:50.151 --> 08:52.547
No thanks. Designated driver.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.390
Too desperate…

08:58.810 --> 09:00.356
Too geeky…

09:03.746 --> 09:06.439
Hello, Abercrombie.

09:26.917 --> 09:27.780
Wow,

09:28.441 --> 09:31.590
Fugazi, Sparta… on vinyl.

09:33.065 --> 09:33.991
Do you mind?

09:42.697 --> 09:46.076
Milo Goes To College. This is a great album.

09:48.159 --> 09:49.609
You know The Descendants?

09:50.034 --> 09:50.643
Yeah.

09:51.822 --> 09:52.766
I’m Peyton.

09:53.705 --> 09:54.417
I’m Gabe…

09:55.737 --> 09:56.660
You wanna hear it?

10:06.665 --> 10:09.447
That’s too easy man, you gotta play some defense.

10:09.496 --> 10:11.718
The prodigal son returns.

10:11.892 --> 10:15.225
- Hey, Mouth, how you doing, baby?
- Hey sir remembers my name… heh.

10:17.066 --> 10:20.217
- Have we met?
- How’s it going, Junk?

10:21.769 --> 10:23.001
Ferguson Thompson.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.205
Okay, guys, come on, it has not been that long.

10:25.288 --> 10:28.440
It feels like forever, dawg. I mean, do you still play street ball?

10:29.188 --> 10:29.900
Better than you.

10:30.406 --> 10:32.889
Aw, baby, he’s been back two seconds and he’s already talkin’ right.

10:33.024 --> 10:36.542
- Ooh… lets see what you get.
- Fine. Shoot for teams.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.468
You know what, why don’t you and Fergie just take it, cuz, you gonna need it.

10:40.622 --> 10:44.004
- Oh really? Like that.
- Just like that. Lock him up, man.

10:45.047 --> 10:47.198
- So what are you drinking?
- I’m not tonight.

10:47.479 --> 10:50.887
Yeah? Me neither. Killer exam on Monday.

10:51.119 --> 10:52.066
Really? On what?

10:52.532 --> 10:53.459
Psychology.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.593
Human sexuality, actually.

10:57.453 --> 11:01.149
What a coincidence. I specialize in sexuality.

11:01.431 --> 11:03.366
Maybe we can be studypartners.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.161
So there’s no way you have this one.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.139
Please. I’ve got it on colored vinyl.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.718
Okay. I was wrong about you.

11:16.715 --> 11:18.667
I guess the, uh, clothes through me off.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.502
I’m into the music, not the uniform.

11:22.700 --> 11:23.602
Same as me.

11:23.838 --> 11:29.220
Yeah? Well maybe some of us can love the song without painting our fingernails black.

11:34.897 --> 11:36.059
Let me get you a drink.

11:37.309 --> 11:38.902
I’m not really drinking tonight.

11:39.946 --> 11:41.896
So that’s why we haven’t met before.

11:42.246 --> 11:43.321
You’re still in high school.

11:44.042 --> 11:47.067
Yeah. I’m a regular cheerleader.

11:48.497 --> 11:51.523
Right, right… you’re a straight edge?

11:53.193 --> 11:54.098
Not really.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.530
How about it? One drink.

11:58.062 --> 12:00.022
We haven’t even gotten to my bootleg collection.

12:02.983 --> 12:03.828
Why not?

12:24.866 --> 12:27.207
Okay. Done.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.907
Catch. I’m gonna head-

12:30.986 --> 12:31.596
Out.

12:40.768 --> 12:41.866
What are you doing here?

12:42.665 --> 12:44.590
Didn’t Brooke tell you I was going to come?

12:45.420 --> 12:48.022
I try to block out everything that Brooke says so whatever you guys are up to

12:48.129 --> 12:50.064
- I’m just not in the mood.
- I’m not up to anything.

12:50.115 --> 12:52.976
Look, I apologized and I told you the truth.

12:53.729 --> 12:57.305
The rest is Brooke. She set up this whole serial date thing.

12:58.323 --> 12:59.740
One card leads to the next.

13:01.206 --> 13:02.818
Well, what does the first one say?

13:05.102 --> 13:06.490
Convince Haley to go.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.839
How am I doing so far?

13:12.045 --> 13:14.272
I don’t know. It depends on what the second card says.

13:18.210 --> 13:21.474
Go to 1423 River Street and find your next envelope.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.314
On the way, tell three things you like about each other.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.488
- I don’t know…
- Look, I’ll go first.

13:28.452 --> 13:30.253
You’re the most patient person I know.

13:32.516 --> 13:37.535
You don’t go postal on me during tutoring and you don’t treat me like some kind of a moron.

13:38.466 --> 13:39.921
I really appreciate that.

13:42.742 --> 13:45.261
Look, I know I have no right to ask,

13:46.064 --> 13:49.296
but we never do anything just fun together.

13:49.581 --> 13:53.309
And plus, this is Brooke. I mean, you can bet it’s not gonna be boring.

13:55.491 --> 13:56.817
I’m free to bail whenever?

13:57.469 --> 13:58.392
Absolutely.

13:59.541 --> 14:00.320
Trust me.

14:06.235 --> 14:07.581
Okay, what the hell.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.967
Brooke, lets go to your room.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.072
Um, you know what, yours is better.

14:15.818 --> 14:16.852
Sick roommate.

14:17.539 --> 14:18.502
You live in this dorm?

14:22.024 --> 14:24.293
Across campus. Way across.

14:25.261 --> 14:27.473
I got my car.

14:27.688 --> 14:29.342
Okay. Great. Lets start there.

14:35.772 --> 14:36.402
It’s you.

14:39.035 --> 14:41.502
Hello? I can’t hear…

14:42.337 --> 14:43.237
Right now?

14:44.472 --> 14:46.734
But you said that I could stay until midnight…

14:47.201 --> 14:48.257
This sucks.

14:52.915 --> 14:54.533
I’m sorry, was that you mom?

14:55.916 --> 14:57.263
What, are you in high school?

14:58.543 --> 15:03.294
Yeah… but these parties are a great place to meet college girls.

15:04.344 --> 15:05.379
Can I get your number?

15:05.461 --> 15:07.913
What kind of loser pretends he’s in college?

15:09.644 --> 15:11.046
I’ll take that for a no.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.374
Real funny.

15:22.982 --> 15:23.729
Hey.

15:26.114 --> 15:26.905
Are you okay?

15:28.359 --> 15:29.142
I don’t know.

15:31.344 --> 15:32.512
What’s this?

15:32.834 --> 15:33.755
Why? You like it?

15:36.720 --> 15:38.308
Did you slip me something.

15:42.578 --> 15:44.063
Oh god I…

15:44.928 --> 15:47.253
Lie down. Good idea.

15:57.948 --> 15:59.255
Leave me alone.

16:04.872 --> 16:05.900
Get off me…

16:10.001 --> 16:11.122
Get off me…

16:22.590 --> 16:23.586
Peyton!

16:33.699 --> 16:35.168
Are you looking for someone?

16:35.250 --> 16:36.734
Yeah. No, my friend’s in here. Get it open.

16:40.510 --> 16:42.485
- Hey!
- Get out!

16:42.870 --> 16:43.837
Get off of her.

16:45.791 --> 16:48.911
Peyton! Oh my god, this perv attacked my friend.

16:49.039 --> 16:51.154
She’s lying. Her friend’s just wasted.

16:52.006 --> 16:53.178
Peyton, come on.

16:54.784 --> 16:56.566
She shouldn’t drink so much.

17:00.708 --> 17:01.942
What’s on your mind, Keith?

17:03.304 --> 17:04.959
What? Is it that obvious?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.319
Well, you just seem a little preoccupied.

17:08.634 --> 17:14.051
Yeah, well, last night after Dan’s party I realized something and I’m tired of settling.

17:14.963 --> 17:15.777
How so?

17:16.678 --> 17:21.728
Well, I developed a bad habit somehow just, uh,

17:22.387 --> 17:25.842
letting things happen to me instead of going after what I really want.

17:26.863 --> 17:28.799
Yeah, I know what you’re saying.

17:28.870 --> 17:31.549
Sometimes I feel like I’m too old to take risks.

17:31.855 --> 17:33.068
Well, yeah, but we’re not.

17:33.299 --> 17:36.059
Hell, why can’t we still be as fearless as we were when we were kids?

17:37.544 --> 17:41.415
Because we have mortgages and businesses

17:41.472 --> 17:44.779
and more responsibility than we ever dreamed of back then.

17:44.846 --> 17:48.364
Well, yeah, but don’t you think we should still take a chance every now and then.

17:50.956 --> 17:52.285
Find something you want and…

17:54.144 --> 17:54.928
go for it.

17:57.647 --> 17:58.583
Like what?

18:01.179 --> 18:03.509
Oh, that’s the bread. Hold that thought.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.585
And Scott is back with a vengeance, showing the locals how it’s done.

18:10.667 --> 18:11.865
That was nice, Lucas.

18:16.005 --> 18:18.163
Man, you got a cell phone too, dawg?

18:19.061 --> 18:20.878
Dang, you sure have changed, man.

18:21.303 --> 18:22.199
Hello?

18:22.286 --> 18:25.251
Lucas, Peyton’s in trouble. Somebody drugged her drink and I can’t wake her up.

18:25.318 --> 18:26.325
Okay, Brooke. Slow down.

18:26.661 --> 18:28.788
- Where are you?
- We’re on the steps of Chapman Hall.

18:28.845 --> 18:30.003
Alright, call the campus police.

18:30.202 --> 18:31.856
I can’t. She’s been drinking!

18:32.158 --> 18:33.591
Okay, I’ll be right there.

18:35.051 --> 18:35.901
Gotta go, guys.

18:37.222 --> 18:37.990
Yo, Luke!

18:42.014 --> 18:45.168
- Nathan joining us?
- No, he had a date with Haley.

18:45.860 --> 18:48.885
His tutor? Must be a mercy thing.

18:49.075 --> 18:51.190
Okay… you did not just say that.

18:51.441 --> 18:54.165
Come on, she’s from Westover. Her father works for the power company.

18:55.430 --> 18:57.749
So, what are you saying? That she’s somehow… beneath him?

18:57.959 --> 19:00.188
Don’t be so dramatic. I’m just saying Nathan could do better.

19:00.396 --> 19:02.388
Hmm, funny, that’s what my parents said about you.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.632
And I proved them wrong.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.710
Well that may be. You should give Haley a chance to do the same.

19:11.155 --> 19:12.470
And number three?

19:13.377 --> 19:15.542
Your loyalty. To Lucas.

19:16.286 --> 19:19.772
I know I’m not always wild about how it plays out, but it’s cool.

19:21.241 --> 19:23.592
Okay, three things I like about you.

19:23.853 --> 19:24.682
My good looks.

19:26.572 --> 19:30.207
I like the way you let me in, past all the bluster you give everybody else.

19:31.852 --> 19:34.196
And I like your smile when you solve a problem.

19:34.944 --> 19:38.312
And… you’re not horrible to look at.

19:42.368 --> 19:43.806
This is where we’re going?

19:45.446 --> 19:46.428
Nice work, Brooke.

19:51.268 --> 19:52.378
Is your friend okay?

19:52.624 --> 19:54.308
I don’t know; she can’t stay awake.

19:54.883 --> 19:55.989
Do you know where you are?

19:57.426 --> 19:58.373
Do you know your name?

19:58.963 --> 20:01.057
Just… dizzy.

20:09.517 --> 20:10.336
Brooke!

20:12.036 --> 20:13.807
Sorry, I didn’t know who else to call.

20:14.324 --> 20:15.210
Is she okay?

20:15.466 --> 20:19.450
She’s not drunk. I think he gave her a sedative. We just need to know what it was.

20:20.663 --> 20:21.569
I’m a med student.

20:22.978 --> 20:25.594
Okay, Brooke. I need you to show me what room she was in.

20:26.008 --> 20:26.797
Okay.

20:27.771 --> 20:29.622
- Can you stay with her?
- Sure.

20:30.038 --> 20:30.795
Alright, come on.

20:39.184 --> 20:39.932
It’s this one.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.888
- Hey, open the door.
- Piss off.

20:45.988 --> 20:48.267
Piss off. Is this your dorm?

20:49.469 --> 20:50.366
Go get your R.A.

20:54.108 --> 20:55.414
- Hey man!
- It’s him.

20:57.211 --> 20:58.574
What did you put in her drink?

20:59.050 --> 21:00.222
I didn’t put anything in her drink.

21:00.423 --> 21:02.656
You can tell me, or you can tell the police.

21:05.563 --> 21:07.858
It was nothing, man. Alright? It was one roofie.

21:08.005 --> 21:08.784
Where are they?

21:13.781 --> 21:15.256
I said where are they!

21:16.106 --> 21:18.031
They’re over there. In the box.

21:29.737 --> 21:32.721
Oh. You better hope to God she’s alright.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.995
This would go a lot faster if you helped.

21:46.368 --> 21:47.673
I’m gonna kill Brooke.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.974
Okay, here it is.

21:56.322 --> 22:00.945
Congratulations. Now, buy each other a gift and exchange them on the way to…

22:01.145 --> 22:03.829
- there’s another address here.
- This is so wrong.

22:04.519 --> 22:06.788
- You want to do it?
- I didn’t say that…

22:08.051 --> 22:08.917
Lets shop.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.931
- Did you see what that saleswoman was wearing?
- Or not wearing.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.327
Here. You go first.

22:16.664 --> 22:17.319
Alright.

22:20.669 --> 22:22.880
- Socks.
- I was playing it safe.

22:23.864 --> 22:24.600
What did you get me?

22:26.371 --> 22:27.335
Open it and see.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.449
Oh my gosh.

22:33.817 --> 22:35.005
This is really nice.

22:36.611 --> 22:37.382
Thanks.

22:37.498 --> 22:41.789
Okay. If we go to this next place and we hate it, then we can just get some pizza, alright?

22:42.593 --> 22:43.233
Okay.

22:54.024 --> 22:58.462
Says here she’ll be disoriented, may have some short term memory loss,

22:59.557 --> 23:01.221
which is maybe not a bad thing.

23:03.557 --> 23:04.924
How long ‘til it wears off?

23:05.682 --> 23:07.105
Overnight, probably.

23:09.219 --> 23:10.293
Think she’ll be okay?

23:11.519 --> 23:12.558
I don’t know, Brooke.

23:13.535 --> 23:15.449
I feel terrible. It’s all my fault.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.835
Yeah, well, what’s done is done.

23:21.513 --> 23:23.321
The med student says she’s gonna be okay, right?

23:23.367 --> 23:26.250
So we just need to watch her until she wakes up.

23:27.007 --> 23:27.909
I can do it.

23:28.773 --> 23:30.355
You’ve done way too much already.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.560
I don’t mind hanging out.

23:35.083 --> 23:37.843
Besides, I’d worry about her too much if I took off anyway.

23:39.716 --> 23:40.417
Okay.

23:43.823 --> 23:44.576
Look.

23:46.862 --> 23:50.017
It's not your fault, okay?

23:52.880 --> 23:54.667
And hey, you did get her out of there.

24:02.377 --> 24:03.181
Here you go, Miss…

24:04.744 --> 24:06.064
- Sir.
- Thanks…

24:08.003 --> 24:10.289
To be honest, I’m a little afraid.

24:15.061 --> 24:17.339
Order your favorite dish for the other person.

24:17.694 --> 24:19.644
Any chance your favorite dish it… prime rib?

24:19.889 --> 24:21.595
Yeah, we have a lot of that at my house.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.713
I’m not very experienced with this so, uh…

24:28.083 --> 24:28.938
Ordering food?

24:29.475 --> 24:32.265
No. I mean, with Peyton,

24:33.270 --> 24:35.554
it was all just parties and games and drama.

24:36.423 --> 24:38.503
I never really did anything like this.

24:38.962 --> 24:39.823
This is different.

24:42.902 --> 24:45.711
Different… good? Different weird?

24:45.921 --> 24:47.632
- No, good.
- Okay.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.026
I’m really glad you decided to come.

24:56.577 --> 25:01.103
So the other night, after the SPL banquet, you said something.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.598
- Yeah, I know.
- You said that you…

25:06.557 --> 25:08.139
you weren’t the person you want to be.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.559
I feel the same.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.892
Yeah, well, maybe it’s time we change that.

25:16.352 --> 25:17.437
I want to.

25:19.398 --> 25:20.540
I’m a little scared.

25:21.615 --> 25:24.160
You don’t need to be. I promise.

25:26.969 --> 25:30.196
Good. Because there’s something I want to talk to you about.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.144
Me too.

25:32.912 --> 25:33.848
You first.

25:37.887 --> 25:41.044
I got accepted to this cooking program in Italy.

25:41.313 --> 25:44.186
It’s been a dream of mine since I was a teenager.

25:47.570 --> 25:50.022
Well, that’s... that’s great.

25:52.263 --> 25:53.285
When would you leave?

25:53.699 --> 25:55.451
Oh. Right away, actually.

25:56.295 --> 25:57.923
I’d have to leave the day after tomorrow.

25:59.715 --> 26:02.952
- Well, for how long?
- Six weeks.

26:03.611 --> 26:06.783
But I mean, do I have a right to go traipsing half way across the world

26:06.828 --> 26:09.925
when I have a son and a business to worry about?

26:11.964 --> 26:14.544
Well, you’ve got good instincts, so what does your gut say?

26:16.005 --> 26:18.697
- That I should go.
- Then you should trust that.

26:19.671 --> 26:24.919
I mean, you know, you spent your whole life putting Lucas first and he’s a good kid,

26:26.159 --> 26:28.318
but now you need to go after a dream of your own.

26:30.053 --> 26:32.368
- That’s what Lucas said.
- Well he’s right.

26:37.771 --> 26:39.189
Here’s to your great adventure.

26:49.091 --> 26:50.050
Still sleeping?

26:52.772 --> 26:54.391
Here, I made some coffee if you want...

26:56.322 --> 26:57.560
I don't know how you do it.

26:58.902 --> 27:01.820
It's easy. The directions are on the bag.

27:03.136 --> 27:04.185
You know what I mean.

27:04.846 --> 27:08.190
You'd give up everything to help her after what happened at Nathan's house.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.156
She told you about that?

27:11.852 --> 27:12.685
A little...

27:14.300 --> 27:18.636
Look, the thing about Peyton; it's really hard for her to let her guard down

27:18.727 --> 27:23.592
but once she does, she's got this amazing heart, you know.

27:23.688 --> 27:25.578
Sounds like something the two of you have in common...

27:26.654 --> 27:27.355
Who knew.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.819
So you don't have any brothers, do you?

27:33.894 --> 27:35.452
You mean... besides Nathan.

27:36.309 --> 27:37.104
Yeah...

27:41.164 --> 27:42.567
How’d that work anyway?

27:43.689 --> 27:46.847
- I mean, are you…
- I’m three months older.

27:48.564 --> 27:50.698
My mom got pregnant right after her senior year.

27:51.420 --> 27:55.312
Dan moved on to Nathan’s mom the first semester of college.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.723
That must have been really hard for your mom.

28:00.248 --> 28:02.147
So you two are pretty close.

28:02.767 --> 28:06.105
Yeah. We do a lot of stuff together.

28:06.674 --> 28:07.401
We talk...

28:08.907 --> 28:09.935
She's really great.

28:10.771 --> 28:14.830
Sounds nice. My parents would rather throw cash at me

28:14.878 --> 28:18.057
and send me on my way then spend any time with me.

28:26.597 --> 28:28.364
Listen, you can grab some sleep if you want.

28:28.938 --> 28:30.197
I'll watch her for a while.

28:30.949 --> 28:31.686
Okay.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.471
I'd rather stay and talk to you if you don't mind.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.438
I don't mind...

28:44.509 --> 28:45.789
I thought you’d be into lobster.

28:46.264 --> 28:48.860
Dude, macaroni and cheese is food of the gods.

28:49.055 --> 28:50.646
Yeah, if the gods are five year olds.

28:53.321 --> 28:54.662
Ready for this next envelope?

28:54.907 --> 28:55.477
Yes.

28:59.425 --> 29:01.953
Reveal a secret that nobody else knows about you.

29:02.767 --> 29:03.372
Okay.

29:05.364 --> 29:08.431
When I was in second grade, I stole some candy.

29:09.223 --> 29:10.683
Come on, that’s not a secret.

29:11.196 --> 29:12.240
Tell me for something to real.

29:17.279 --> 29:19.531
I cheated on a Geometry test last year.

29:21.288 --> 29:22.814
Haley James cheated?

29:23.223 --> 29:23.930
Yeah.

29:24.821 --> 29:27.361
My dad was out of town and um, my mom was sick

29:27.791 --> 29:30.388
and I had to take care of her so I didn’t really have time to study.

29:31.892 --> 29:32.645
Did you get caught?

29:33.050 --> 29:35.098
No. That wasn't the point.

29:35.184 --> 29:39.026
I mean, I knew what I had done and that didn’t sit right for me.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.809
So you started tutoring?

29:42.594 --> 29:43.342
Yeah.

29:44.699 --> 29:50.781
Yeah. I guess I thought it would be like, penance, or something. But it turns out I really liked it.

29:52.282 --> 29:53.715
I thought it was just to get to me.

29:55.630 --> 29:56.805
So, what about you?

29:56.909 --> 29:58.611
- What’s your… secret?
- What’s up, Nathan?

30:00.484 --> 30:02.553
- Hey.
- What’s up, guys?

30:03.525 --> 30:04.391
What’s this?

30:05.190 --> 30:06.910
Well, you know Haley’s my tutor, right?

30:07.612 --> 30:09.087
Looks more like a date to me.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.065
No, dude, it’s definitely not a date.

30:13.407 --> 30:15.446
Okay. If that’s your story.

30:21.007 --> 30:22.675
Hey, I’m sorry about that.

30:22.747 --> 30:24.632
Are you really that embarrassed to be seen with me?

30:24.739 --> 30:26.424
No. He just, he was gonna-

30:26.721 --> 30:29.414
Why are you only nice to me when we’re alone?

30:35.551 --> 30:36.664
You know,

30:38.143 --> 30:41.432
for a few hours there I was actually starting to think that you weren’t a son of a bitch

30:41.487 --> 30:43.469
and you just, God, fooled me again.

30:45.221 --> 30:46.618
No! Haley, wait.

30:56.609 --> 31:00.762
Hey. How are you feeling?

31:02.217 --> 31:02.928
Like hell.

31:04.116 --> 31:05.176
What are you doing here?

31:08.069 --> 31:09.548
You don’t remember last night, huh?

31:12.359 --> 31:14.725
I remember Brooke took me to a party.

31:16.363 --> 31:18.376
A guy slipped you something in your drink.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.090
Brooke called me to help out.

31:21.422 --> 31:24.284
No, nothing happened! Brooke stopped him.

31:27.105 --> 31:28.821
Alright, I’m gonna go wake her up, okay?

31:29.631 --> 31:30.350
Wait!

31:32.421 --> 31:35.041
Thanks. Again.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.741
I just wanted to make sure you were okay, alright?

31:39.251 --> 31:40.004
Lucas…

31:42.815 --> 31:43.840
I’m sorry.

31:46.354 --> 31:47.101
For what?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.723
All sorts of things.

32:07.014 --> 32:08.237
You want me to follow you home?

32:09.471 --> 32:11.949
- No. I'll be okay.
- Okay.

32:13.854 --> 32:15.893
So why'd you call me, anyway?

32:17.029 --> 32:19.636
I'm not Nathan or one of the guys...

32:21.698 --> 32:23.250
Because I knew you'd come through.

32:26.768 --> 32:28.034
You're a good friend to her, Brooke.

32:28.621 --> 32:29.915
You sound surprised.

32:30.388 --> 32:34.423
Sorry, I just... I guess I just figured that you were...

32:34.725 --> 32:37.813
- A brainless slut.
- No. You're not.

32:39.098 --> 32:43.009
What I was gonna say was that I just… I didn't think that you were...

32:43.925 --> 32:48.089
that tough. But I was clearly wrong about you.

32:49.805 --> 32:50.623
It's okay.

32:51.648 --> 32:52.696
Most people are.

32:59.287 --> 33:04.073
Hey Brooke... call me. If you need anything, okay?

33:05.878 --> 33:06.941
Count on that.

33:20.189 --> 33:23.680
Please tell me that you were somewhere in the land of no phones.

33:24.422 --> 33:25.185
I know.

33:26.408 --> 33:27.260
I should’ve called.

33:27.388 --> 33:29.922
Coming home would’ve been another option.

33:30.715 --> 33:31.919
You’re right. I’m sorry.

33:32.236 --> 33:36.696
You looked me in the eye and said ‘Go to Italy. I can take care of myself.’

33:36.763 --> 33:37.797
Look, I can, Mom!

33:38.519 --> 33:40.311
A guy drugged Peyton’s drink at a party.

33:40.598 --> 33:43.588
Brooke called me for help. I took her home, waited until she felt better.

33:44.664 --> 33:45.401
Truth.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.242
As excuses go, that’s pretty solid.

33:51.090 --> 33:53.454
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she’ll be fine.

33:55.498 --> 33:59.056
Drugs, parties, and I’m supposed to leave the country.

33:59.281 --> 34:01.406
Hey, don’t not go to Italy because of this.

34:02.528 --> 34:03.881
Okay, Mom, please?

34:04.540 --> 34:08.817
We’ll see. But if I do decide to go I’m going to have Keith come and stay here while I’m gone.

34:08.989 --> 34:10.880
Great, just as long as you go.

34:16.542 --> 34:20.302
I went on Peyton’s computer and booked you a flight on the emergency credit card,

34:21.487 --> 34:22.661
non-refundable.

34:25.678 --> 34:27.551
I want you to have something for yourself, Mom.

34:31.364 --> 34:32.277
You’ve earned it.

34:51.529 --> 34:54.047
Trying to wake up my parents? That’s their room.

34:55.496 --> 34:58.836
Wait! Haley, look, I need to apologize, okay?

34:59.650 --> 35:02.405
You should write them in bulk if you’re going to hand apologies out that often.

35:03.009 --> 35:08.529
Can we just- I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’m not like you.

35:08.887 --> 35:09.804
What does that mean?

35:10.501 --> 35:16.441
I screw up a lot, alright? And being around you, I just, I don’t want to be that guy anymore.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.391
Well who do you want to be, Nathan?

35:18.754 --> 35:21.248
I want to be someone who’s good enough to be seen with you.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.504
Well you should’ve thought of that last night.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.443
You know, I keep putting myself out there, and you keep blowing it,

35:27.474 --> 35:29.424
it’s probably a good thing because at this point there’s nothing

35:29.471 --> 35:31.283
you could say or do that’s gonna surprise me.

35:36.819 --> 35:37.709
Except that.

35:39.665 --> 35:41.032
You shouldn’t have done that, Nathan.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.598
I wanted to.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.240
Yeah.

36:17.449 --> 36:19.323
Have I lost my dining privileges?

36:20.249 --> 36:21.432
Why would you?

36:21.760 --> 36:26.942
Oh, because yesterday I popped off about how you should drop everything and go to Italy.

36:27.023 --> 36:28.851
I can be a tad bit pushy.

36:29.195 --> 36:31.631
Actually, I was all set to go.

36:32.501 --> 36:35.948
But then this morning I was going over the numbers and there really is no way

36:35.989 --> 36:38.313
I can afford to shut down for six weeks.

36:38.744 --> 36:40.089
Well then don’t.

36:41.028 --> 36:44.673
- Hire me. I can take over.
- Right…

36:44.744 --> 36:47.801
Well why not? I’ve got the time and the management experience,

36:47.863 --> 36:50.556
and if that’s all that’s keeping you from going.

36:50.674 --> 36:54.136
Deb, be serious. I have two things in my life.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.639
- Lucas and this café.
- I know that.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.711
And because of that you know I take it seriously.

37:00.761 --> 37:05.185
You can walk me through the big stuff today and Haley can help me with the rest.

37:07.997 --> 37:09.728
I can’t. I can’t.

37:09.921 --> 37:13.101
Karen. I’d like to believe we’re friends.

37:13.387 --> 37:17.827
And, I know that’s happened quickly, but it has, and it means a lot to me,

37:18.456 --> 37:22.287
so I’m going to say this and then deny it if it ever gets out.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.464
There are things in my life I would change if I could,

37:28.149 --> 37:30.270
and running from opportunity is one of them.

37:30.766 --> 37:32.113
Go to Italy.

37:33.567 --> 37:34.822
Let me help you go.

37:36.030 --> 37:37.264
Your life is now.

37:42.113 --> 37:43.280
Okay…

37:45.564 --> 37:46.414
Okay.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.084
Are you going to play D?

37:55.543 --> 37:56.120
What?

37:56.839 --> 37:59.481
She aint coming to watch me play, dawg. Mmm-mmm.

38:03.839 --> 38:04.422
Hey.

38:07.048 --> 38:08.002
What’s your name again?

38:08.647 --> 38:09.368
Mouth.

38:09.767 --> 38:12.472
Really? That was my nickname in summer camp.

38:14.151 --> 38:16.440
Because I slept with my mouth open.

38:17.018 --> 38:18.801
Right. Of course…

38:21.565 --> 38:23.614
You know, you’re kind of cute. Do you have a girlfriend?

38:26.138 --> 38:28.057
I’ve got a real knack for hooking people up.

38:37.731 --> 38:39.840
Mmm. What smells so good?

38:40.777 --> 38:42.384
I got takeout from Karen.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.264
What’s all this?

38:48.360 --> 38:49.896
I’m going back to work for a while.

38:51.228 --> 38:54.294
Oh. Deb, that’s great. The foundation must be thrilled.

38:54.381 --> 38:56.250
Uh, no, not with the foundation.

38:56.343 --> 39:01.807
Um, I’m going to run the café for Karen while she’s away at cooking school in Italy.

39:02.267 --> 39:06.538
Keith is moving in with Lucas while she’s away and I told Karen...

39:08.274 --> 39:09.795
Oh, um, what are you doing?

39:09.861 --> 39:12.539
I’m looking for the hidden cameras. Because you can not be serious.

39:13.209 --> 39:15.162
Uh, I am, serious.

39:16.201 --> 39:21.387
Karen has had enough taken away from her and if I can give just some tiny part of that back-

39:21.428 --> 39:23.651
And you did all this without discussing it with me first?

39:24.387 --> 39:27.870
The way you discussed all those decisions you made about Nathan with me?

39:28.243 --> 39:29.897
Payback’s an ugly emotion, Deb.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.449
I thought you were going for six weeks.

39:40.890 --> 39:43.415
So, you sure you’re okay with Deb taking over?

39:43.461 --> 39:45.293
Yeah. If it means you get to go.

39:46.839 --> 39:50.204
- Oh. I love you.
- I love you, too.

39:57.613 --> 39:59.098
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

39:59.452 --> 40:01.858
Great… got a little present for you.

40:03.743 --> 40:06.236
This is all that’s left of my backpacking trip through Europe.

40:06.563 --> 40:08.571
- 10,000 lyre.
- Yep.

40:08.648 --> 40:12.087
It’s only worth about 6 bucks but you can, uh, get yourself a gelato.

40:16.891 --> 40:19.630
Don’t worry. It will all be waiting for you when you get back.

40:24.864 --> 40:27.218
Around six o’clock people get out of work, they want to come by...

40:27.316 --> 40:29.062
- Six o’clock.
- Yeah. That’s when it starts getting really busy.

40:29.739 --> 40:30.987
- I’ll just…
- Yeah.

40:43.390 --> 40:44.797
Bye… Sorry.

40:50.272 --> 40:51.582
What up, Nathan?

40:58.481 --> 40:59.365
Haley!

41:21.435 --> 41:24.286
- Don’t forget to call when you land, okay?
- Alright.

41:26.973 --> 41:29.938
You remember when you said the other night that I had good instincts

41:30.137 --> 41:31.421
and that I should trust them?

41:32.385 --> 41:33.020
Yeah.

41:40.727 --> 41:41.679
You were right.

42:01.168 --> 42:02.017
Hi.

42:10.363 --> 42:11.361
I owe you.

42:26.138 --> 42:28.223
So, been to any bad parties lately?

42:30.241 --> 42:31.882
Come on, I’ll walk you to history.
