-Of course.
-Turn off the fucking car!

01:12.363 --> 01:14.032
Sorry, did I do something wrong?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.700
Get out.

I don't understand.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
-[man] Get out!
-Did I run--

01:20.580 --> 01:21.873
You're hurting me!

01:22.290 --> 01:23.374
What are you doing?

01:24.042 --> 01:24.959
Tell me what I did!

01:25.668 --> 01:26.586
Tell me!

01:27.587 --> 01:30.131
-My husband works--
-Exactly, lady. Your husband.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.303
No. No! Kiki! No!

01:36.262 --> 01:37.138
Kiki!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.181
Calm down.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.024
Open the door! Let me out of here!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.195
Let me out!

01:58.034 --> 02:00.453
You know it's not a good idea
to leave your children

02:00.537 --> 02:02.497
under the sun in a hot car, right?

02:03.748 --> 02:05.542
Very bad, Mrs. Mika Camarena.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.169
Kiki.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.755

02:10.839 --> 02:12.507
Kiki.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.261
[in English] What'd he say?

02:16.344 --> 02:21.141
He said if I liked Guadalajara
and I said yes. He seemed pretty nice.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.259
You can run the table.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.471
The cartel had the biggest gang in Mexico
in their pocket.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.349
A private army basically
doing their bidding.

04:26.432 --> 04:30.478
These guys brought new meaning
to the term "serve and protect."

04:30.561 --> 04:32.855
Harassing, intimidating,

04:32.939 --> 04:34.357
keeping the DEA out of the way

04:34.440 --> 04:37.694
so that Félix Gallardo
could focus on other things,

04:37.777 --> 04:38.987
like expanding.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.991
[Matta in Spanish]
I have heard from Isabella

04:43.074 --> 04:45.368
about the organization you built.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.537
You've done well.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.499
But now she tells me
you want to change things.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.379
More like taking advantage
of certain opportunities, no?

05:00.341 --> 05:03.886
The Americans have closed
almost all the Caribbean routes.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.308
You have a mountain of product
just sitting there with nowhere to go.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.228
Félix can swing the door open
to 3,000 kilometers of the border.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.940
And here you are, Mr. Mexico.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.150
[chuckles]

05:17.233 --> 05:21.988
Look, we ship marijuana
across the border every day.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.865
Day and night.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.284
Seven days a week, we never stop.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.412

05:34.709 --> 05:36.794
And you have the political juice
to pull that off?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.254
Yeah.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.383
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself, personally.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.641
This isn't like selling bananas one day
and pineapples the next.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.144
It's a whole other business.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.314
If I give you my support...

05:57.398 --> 06:01.194
I have to be sure that you understand
what you're getting into.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.614
Speaking clearly...

06:05.365 --> 06:09.452
once you handle Colombian powder,
you're responsible for it.

Lose the product...

06:13.331 --> 06:14.874

06:15.249 --> 06:17.293
there will be consequences.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.046
Very serious consequences.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.924
That's understood.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.764
There are two organizations down there
that really matter.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.643
One's shrewd. Businessmen.

06:35.686 --> 06:39.065
The other, he has very big emotions.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.650
[chuckles]

06:41.442 --> 06:44.237
Tell me about the good businessmen.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.614
Dealing with them requires
a lot of discretion.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.783
Because someone will be jealous?

06:49.492 --> 06:50.701
Like I said...

06:52.286 --> 06:53.955
big emotions.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.167
I'd be a fool not to go
with the shrewd ones.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.132
I will make the call then.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.802
I'll let you know when they want to meet.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.179
Miguel Ángel, if I were you...

07:11.139 --> 07:12.932
I would take her with me.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.935
Colombians love a round ass.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.481
Just by looking at her, those poor fools
won't even be able to talk.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.817

07:28.322 --> 07:30.324
You have a good thing going here,
Mr. Félix.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.747
Then why change it?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.085
Like I said...

07:42.753 --> 07:44.464
there's an opportunity, no?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.637
Thank you for everything.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.475

unlocked. City feels different. It does.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.538
Did you say he knew your name?

08:18.372 --> 08:20.917
Yeah. He didn't look
at my license or papers.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.461
Locked me in the car
while he talked to Kiki Jr.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.296

08:26.631 --> 08:30.009
I went to high school with guys
in Calexico that were scarier than him.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.427
He put his hands on you?

08:35.723 --> 08:36.807
Yeah.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.226
[Rita] You tell Kiki that?

08:39.393 --> 08:40.311
No way.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.774

08:47.068 --> 08:49.987
[Jaime in English] I filed a report
with Mendez in person

08:50.071 --> 08:51.239
and copied the embassy on it.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.951
So we're filing police reports
on the fucking police?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.619
How's that work exactly?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.288
It's one thing if they're tailing us
every time we leave our office,

09:00.248 --> 09:02.542
but this other shit? Come on.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.502
What did the embassy say?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.297
-Still waiting on a response.
-[Kiki] How's this for a response?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.675

I'm gonna find them

09:10.758 --> 09:12.134

take down the ones calling the shots.

Yeah, I'm not talking
about Mexico City. Fuck them.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.322
I'm talking about going over their head,
straight to D.C.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.741
-You'd do that?
-[Jaime] I would.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.994
What's D.C. really care about?

09:38.536 --> 09:41.539
Because it ain't seizure numbers
or drug arrests, right?

09:42.206 --> 09:45.209
Money. We know Félix
is pulling in huge cash.

09:45.293 --> 09:49.672
Now we put a number on it, we make
Miguel Félix Gallardo famous up north.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.174
Rog, tell them
what you just told me about Spain.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.304
DEA Madrid's up on some dealer
from Cádiz for about six months.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.516
Now, one of the numbers he calls the most
is here in Guadalajara.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.476
Hotel Americas.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.815
So Spanish cops put in a diplomatic
request for a tap on this end.

10:07.898 --> 10:12.570
Now since it's from Spain, doesn't ring
any alarm bells, gets approved.

10:12.653 --> 10:16.866
This gives us a back door warrant
to tap Félix's entire operation.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.994
That gets D.C. to wake up,
force the Mexicans to act.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.038
That's how this gets done.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.290
Heath's gonna be pissed.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.959
Well, he can send me a fucking memo.

it would be something to do.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.332
showed him a badge
and beat him with a gun.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.627
Told him they'd kill him

[narrator] There's a story
about a group of blind men

15:59.833 --> 16:01.418
who come across an elephant.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.630
I'm not sure why,
but that's not the point.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.927
One of the blind men touches its trunk,
another pats its side,

16:10.552 --> 16:12.638
another guy grabs the tail.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.933
And they all think
that's what an elephant is.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.145
Because they're too close,
they can't get the whole picture.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.063
[phone rings]

16:21.146 --> 16:23.357
The DEA had been on Félix for months,

16:23.440 --> 16:26.652
but turns out they were just blind guys
feeling up an elephant.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.988
Perspective changes everything.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.739
I think that's the point.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.909
Well, that and a good wire tap.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.579
Their phone guy
didn't just grab a single line.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.957
The crafty bastard
did the entire exchange.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.127
Every number that passed
through the Hotel Americas.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.130
And the second the wire tap went up,

16:46.213 --> 16:49.133
they started to truly understand
the Guadalajara cartel.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.887
For the first time, they started
to see the whole fucking elephant.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.472
All of the fifth floor.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.974
[phones ringing]

16:57.057 --> 17:01.270
Purchasing. A full-time secretary
to handle DFS bribes.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.188
Scores of accountants.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.107
Transpo.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.193
All working toward a single goal:

17:08.736 --> 17:11.989
the outflow of weed, the inflow of cash.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.788
And overseeing it all from right there
in sunny Guadalajara,

17:19.872 --> 17:22.791
our man Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

17:23.542 --> 17:27.212
They called it Operation Padrino.
And what they discovered was staggering.

17:27.296 --> 17:32.801
The sheer size. Payroll for field workers,
drivers, cops, enforcers.

17:32.885 --> 17:37.181
Nearly a hundred code names
for politicians, small and large.

17:37.264 --> 17:43.854
Then, payments for farm equipment, fuel,
real estate, even fucking strawberry soda.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.775
But the most interesting news
was where he parked his cash.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.152
[in English] Hey, Chief!

17:50.235 --> 17:53.030
You know that Texas number
that keeps popping up on the fifth floor?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.116
El Paso Savings and Trust.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.494
Son of a bitch.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.414
-Good old American dollars, boys.
-Makes sense.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.793
We don't even cash our paychecks here
because the banks are so fucking sketchy.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.506
-Stay on it.
-Will do.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.925
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.991
What's on the fifth floor?

18:39.159 --> 18:40.369
The Wizard of Oz.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.083
No. Just reading about that asshole.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.839
You think he lies in bed at night
reading about you?

18:52.464 --> 18:54.133
If he knows what's good for him.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.554
He probably doesn't even know my name.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.431
He will. One day.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.558
Fucking A.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.730
Um, Kikito has that choir thing tomorrow.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.149
-Yeah, at 4:30.
-Mm-hmm.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.736
You okay?

19:17.531 --> 19:20.117
The girls and I are gonna start
carpooling together.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.954
Help each other shopping, you know,
help each other with the kids.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.332
-Yeah, that's good.
-Yeah.

19:28.125 --> 19:32.171
-Strength by numbers, you know?
-Yeah, just for a week or two. [sighs]

19:43.473 --> 19:47.227
So this Wizard of Oz...
you gonna bust his ass?

19:48.478 --> 19:49.771
Mm-hmm.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.650
Getting closer every day.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.069
Good.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.808
You're gonna want to check this out.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.311
Sir!

20:34.316 --> 20:37.819
I was looking through
the transcripts this-- last night.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.742
Just cue it up here.

20:46.662 --> 20:50.249
[man in Spanish]

20:52.960 --> 20:56.171
[in English] He's saying he's got to buy
new trucks for the upcoming harvest.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.381
[man 2 in Spanish]

21:02.886 --> 21:04.638
[in English]
Our guy's not home?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.223
Uh-uh.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.309
But his checkbook is.
Sitting right there in his office.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.479
How do we get our hands on it?

21:13.939 --> 21:14.773
I can do it.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.948
Well, let's talk
about how that might happen.

21:26.159 --> 21:30.289
[narrator] Well, you're probably
an expert on Colombian cocaine by now.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.875
But in the early '80s,
it was only just making a name for itself.

21:33.959 --> 21:38.171
And even in those early days,
it was already a tale of two cities.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.550
Number one in the game
was the Medellín cartel,

21:41.633 --> 21:43.093
making a lot of noise.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.221
But coming up quickly
was a more discreet organization.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.558
They called themselves
the Gentlemen of Cali.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.602
Everybody else called them
the Cali cartel.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.772
[Félix in Spanish] Escobar dominates
what's left of the Caribbean routes.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.107
[man]
Fine. Let him have it.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.820
Matta made this introduction
so that I can offer you something new.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.031
Something safer and permanent.

22:04.114 --> 22:10.412
Right now, we move weed easily
to any border city in the US.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.708
Not sure if you guys are familiar
with the Sonora-Tijuana corridor.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.959
It's all ours.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.711
We bring in tons through there.

22:17.794 --> 22:22.049
By land or sea, either way,
I can bring it in.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.926
Now picture this:

22:25.927 --> 22:27.012
Your cocaine...

22:29.014 --> 22:30.349
and my distribution.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.020
We will bring in more powder
than through the Bahamas.

22:35.103 --> 22:37.814
Fucking American agents in Florida,

22:37.898 --> 22:40.859
they'll be dumbfounded and won't even know
where it's coming from.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.367
Yes, we know about your reputation.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.952
What you've accomplished.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.373
But this hand-off system of yours...

22:54.831 --> 22:58.335
marijuana is one thing,
coke is another, no?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.381
I don't really agree with that.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.383
[chuckles]

23:04.466 --> 23:09.638
A market of $4 billion
versus whatever that shit makes.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.474
What my partner means is that...

23:12.933 --> 23:14.976
when things become more valuable...

23:15.519 --> 23:18.522
trust comes at a higher price, no?

23:19.064 --> 23:23.610
Yes, everything has a price,
and it must be paid, right?

23:24.611 --> 23:26.655
[man] Music to my ears.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
Because it will be paid by you.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.743
[Félix] What the...?

23:33.161 --> 23:34.287
Sorry?

23:34.871 --> 23:37.165
The payoffs, middlemen...

23:38.417 --> 23:39.960
all of that comes out of your end.

23:40.043 --> 23:46.591
You'll have to excuse us, our friend here
is slow to warm up to new people.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.762
It's okay, I agree.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.722
We'll pay.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.059
[man]
Sicilia Falcón still runs Tijuana.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.688
He has
a lot of well-connected friends there.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.400
In Mexico and the United States.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.737
I have friends too. A lot.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.989
Well, that's good.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.700
But we know him...

24:12.784 --> 24:15.287
and not you, so what do we do?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.539
Where does he fit in all of this?

24:18.874 --> 24:23.587
Out of everyone here, the one that
knows him best is my associate, right?

24:24.087 --> 24:25.755
Tell them.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.300
[Isabella] It's very simple.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.760
Falcón can't move
the kind of weight you require.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.681
I've known him for several years.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.559
He's well liked in Tijuana, but...

24:37.893 --> 24:40.020
but Falcón doesn't have what Félix has.

24:41.146 --> 24:45.066
So you have to ask yourself, do you want
to move your coke through a straw

24:45.150 --> 24:46.193
or a pipeline?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.236
[chuckles]

24:52.657 --> 24:54.493
[Félix]
In only a matter of months,

24:55.285 --> 24:58.330
Medellín will look tiny compared to you.
[chuckles]

25:07.964 --> 25:09.090
[Félix] Let's see...

25:09.174 --> 25:10.050
[clears throat]

25:10.634 --> 25:15.472
Do me a favor and imagine how comfortable
you and your brother's life will be...

25:16.389 --> 25:18.391
when we start to move these amounts?

25:20.143 --> 25:21.520
Come on.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.189
You will be walking in the clouds.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.193
I didn't come here to waste your time.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.542
Go ahead and close the fucking deal,
I want to take her dancing.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.002
Before Pachito here breaks more hearts.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.671
[chuckles]

25:57.430 --> 25:58.932
Let's talk numbers.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.726
[pop music in Spanish playing]

26:02.852 --> 26:05.188
[music continues on radio]

26:07.524 --> 26:09.150
[in Spanish]
It's a dream of mine, man.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.152
My own business.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.031
You should invest.
Get in on the ground floor.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.700
What do you have to lose?

26:16.783 --> 26:19.286
What do you know about running
a restaurant, Cochi?

26:19.369 --> 26:20.579
[chuckles] Well, shit.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.330
What's there to know?

26:22.622 --> 26:24.040
Just have to do it.

26:24.499 --> 26:25.333
Try it.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.297
[singing in Spanish]

26:45.478 --> 26:46.646
What the fuck?

26:48.481 --> 26:51.026
-What kind of food you gonna have?
-[Cochiloco] Seafood, man.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.360
Sinaloan style.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.738
Gonna call it "The Crazy Lobster."

26:55.405 --> 26:56.615
Sounds good.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.366
[Benjamín]
Hey, ladies, get to work.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.036
-[man] Let's go.
-[Benjamín] Hey, Chapito.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.496
How's virginity treating you?

27:03.580 --> 27:04.998
[laughs]

27:06.166 --> 27:07.917
I pulled 3 women last night,
what the fuck.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.463
-Three women?
-Cochiloco here is opening a restaurant.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.882
-Yeah, The Crazy Lobster.
-What kind?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.467
Sinaloan seafood, man.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.469
Oh, spicy ceviche.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.095
-That's right.
-[man] Benjamín!

27:19.179 --> 27:20.889
[shouting and clamoring]

27:20.972 --> 27:22.057
[gunfire]

27:25.560 --> 27:26.519
[soldier] Move it!

27:26.853 --> 27:28.229
Raise the door!

27:28.355 --> 27:29.230
Quickly!

27:31.733 --> 27:32.609
Quick!

27:34.611 --> 27:35.737
You know who I am?

27:36.237 --> 27:37.280
Who my family is?

27:50.210 --> 27:52.003
[truck beeping]

27:55.256 --> 27:56.633
[truck engine stops]

27:58.343 --> 27:59.469
Mr. Falcón.

28:00.595 --> 28:01.680
What the fuck?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.432
Indeed, Benjamín.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.103
Take all of that.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.063
Okay, assholes, take it out.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.400
Assurances were given to me
by your associate in Guadalajara.

28:13.483 --> 28:18.822
Promises were made,
which are now being broken. So you ask...

28:18.905 --> 28:20.448
"What the fuck?"

28:21.032 --> 28:23.243
-Look, you don't want to--
-[yells] Not a word, fuckers!

28:24.869 --> 28:29.624
Starting today, no one, no one,
moves a dime of weed through my plaza.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.792
No one!

28:32.627 --> 28:33.712
Not even you.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.049
Tell your brothers.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.553
[engine starts]

28:41.636 --> 28:43.805
[Falcón]
That's enough, guys.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.306
[engine starts]

29:00.321 --> 29:01.781
[soldier] Hurry.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.658
Do that thing with the thing.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.452
[tires screech]

29:06.703 --> 29:07.829
[Benjamín] Hey!

29:22.385 --> 29:23.636
[snorts]

29:23.720 --> 29:25.638
[in Spanish]
Rafa, it's him.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.895
You think you can fuck with my business?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.062
[Falcón] Ah.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.231
Rafa, you got my message?

29:35.315 --> 29:38.610
[Rafa] Message, my ass.
You stole my dope, fucker!

29:38.693 --> 29:42.363
Félix is moving on my entire business.
How else would I react?

29:45.784 --> 29:46.785
What?

29:47.702 --> 29:49.204
Your boss didn't tell you?

29:49.287 --> 29:52.123
He's my partner, asshole, get it straight.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.833
If you say so.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.629
I heard Félix flew to Cali this morning
to fuck me over.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.465
You as well, it sounds like.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.595
Listen, don't you understand that cocaine
makes ten times the profit of marijuana?

30:05.678 --> 30:08.264
Félix moving into coke
makes your sinsemilla useless.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.600
Come on, partner.

30:11.726 --> 30:15.146
Maybe you and I should work together.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.315
Maybe you should shut your mouth,

30:17.398 --> 30:19.692
and maybe I should
go get my fucking dope and gut you--

30:19.776 --> 30:21.861
You fucking piece of shit peasant!

30:24.948 --> 30:26.324
What's wrong with you?

30:26.407 --> 30:29.035
-What did Amado do now?
-Did Félix go to Colombia?

30:30.537 --> 30:34.415
If he gets involved with coke,
where does that leave us?

30:34.499 --> 30:37.168
Calm down, who said this? Falcón?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.420
Don't listen to that cocksucker.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.047
Have a fucking beer.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.215
I'll look into it.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.009
[panting]

30:49.973 --> 30:51.015
[sighs]

30:53.601 --> 30:56.437
[in Spanish] When we land,
call Matta so he knows it went well.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.981
[Isabella]
I'm sure he already knows.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.943
[Félix] What the hell?

31:02.026 --> 31:04.404
-Easy, I'm Miguel--
-Don't touch me!

31:04.487 --> 31:05.780
[grunting]

31:05.864 --> 31:08.825
[man]
What the fuck?

31:08.908 --> 31:10.076
[grunting]

31:10.159 --> 31:11.369
What the fuck?

31:11.452 --> 31:12.704
[panting]

31:12.787 --> 31:14.289
Calm down!

31:14.581 --> 31:16.374
-Calm down!
-[Félix] Okay.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.001
You okay?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.461
[man]
Get comfortable, it's a long drive.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.463
[Isabella]
Who are you?

31:22.672 --> 31:24.465
Boss wants to talk.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.384
Where are we going?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.431
To Medellín.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.058
Nice sunglasses there.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.060
Try them on, see how they look.

31:41.149 --> 31:45.278
-[Maria in Spanish] Hello.
-Maria, look at you, beautiful as ever.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.531
Miguel's not here.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.199
He didn't say when he'd be back.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.578
Days, maybe.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.330
Okay.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.583
If he calls, tell him we need to talk.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.209
Hope you're well.

32:01.794 --> 32:02.879
[Maria] Wait.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.174
Sit with me a minute?

32:10.386 --> 32:14.891
So, Colombia. Rafa mentioned something,
but I wasn't sure it was true.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.103
Lately you spend
more time with him than I do.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.648
Why is he doing this?

32:22.148 --> 32:24.859
Sometimes I feel like
I don't know him at all.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.403
Félix is not a simple man, Maria.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.781
We have trafficking in our blood.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.784
Your father knew the game
as well as anyone.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.497
I remember being
in the fields with my father.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.749
He would do it so we could eat.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.628
But look now, Neto.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.130
Our children don't go hungry.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.551
[sighs]
So what did he say?

32:52.011 --> 32:55.098
"If I don't do it, someone else will."

32:57.475 --> 32:58.643
And he will.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.772
That guy is no fool.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.901
Okay.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.945
When he gets back, ask him to call me.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.074
You'll see him before I do.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.213
[Jaime in English]
Take off your hat.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.632
[Knapp]
Oh, yeah.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.592
I mean, he's shorter than you.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.845
-But he is better looking.
-Yeah.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.849
I don't know. Pretty close.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.102
-Jaime?
-God damn it.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.567
Anything feels off, you pull the plug.
All right?

33:48.526 --> 33:49.819
Got some civilian clothes, son?

33:49.902 --> 33:51.863
-Yes, sir.
-All right. Go get them.

33:54.824 --> 33:55.908
[sighs]

33:59.620 --> 34:01.330
[in Spanish]
Those guys are out.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.250
All right, let's go.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.018
[car engine starts]

35:01.599 --> 35:02.558
[in English]
You're good.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.105
Thanks, Suzy.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.203
Yeah, right over there.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.040
[Kiki]
Right here. Perfect.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.084
Well, thanks for doing this, Suzy.

35:28.835 --> 35:29.919
Be safe.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.546
[Kiki] I will be.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.134
[car door closes]

35:57.864 --> 35:58.739
[in Spanish]
Thank you.

36:09.750 --> 36:13.045
You guys go up. I'm getting a drink
at the bar, I'll wait there.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.520
Do I know you?

36:32.148 --> 36:35.359
[in Spanish with English accent] Emilio
Gómez Estrada. I work in agriculture.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.820
You too?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.031
No.

36:43.492 --> 36:44.660
Good day.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.640
[man in Spanish]
Okay, kids, we have arrived.

37:28.955 --> 37:29.997
[man] Let's go.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.002
Get out quickly, go!

37:35.169 --> 37:36.671
Move it, sweetie!

37:37.922 --> 37:40.258
[Colombian music playing]

37:48.474 --> 37:51.435
[chatter in background]

37:53.688 --> 37:55.356
[man]
Hey, what's up, Poison?

37:57.066 --> 37:59.277
-How are you, Blackie?
-Look what I brought you.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.868
[monkey chatters]

38:14.083 --> 38:15.918
Okay, let's do this.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.879
You come with me.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.549
And you stay here.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.847
[Poison]
Come with me now.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.235
[toilet flushes]

38:51.245 --> 38:52.079
Agh!

38:53.956 --> 38:55.082
Um...

38:56.042 --> 38:58.169
[in accented Spanish]
I need to... go in.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.006

39:05.676 --> 39:06.927
Ah.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.888

39:09.555 --> 39:12.099
Geez. [sighs]

39:31.619 --> 39:33.245
[elevator dings]

40:30.469 --> 40:31.887
[in Spanish] Wait here.

40:32.847 --> 40:33.848
Okay.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.914
[water splashing]

40:58.998 --> 41:02.001
[animals grunting]

41:17.850 --> 41:19.101
[Pablo] Hippos.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.529
You ever seen one before?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.240
No.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.409
I haven't had the pleasure in person.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.622
They look sweet.

41:41.957 --> 41:45.336
Like a baby, fat and bald.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.672
But they're temperamental.

41:49.882 --> 41:55.554
Get between it and something
it cares about, it will bite you in half.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.896
Follow me.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.200
Look, brother... [clears throat]

42:18.869 --> 42:21.664
I've always believed
that the truth is best.

42:23.874 --> 42:29.463
With friends, enemies, it doesn't matter,
I always speak the truth.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.925
I expect the same from you.

42:37.054 --> 42:39.431
So I will only ask once...

42:42.768 --> 42:44.979
Why are you in Colombia?

42:48.983 --> 42:51.610
I had a meeting
with the Cali organization.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.240
We made a deal...

42:56.699 --> 43:01.787
to move their product through Mexico.

43:01.870 --> 43:03.163
Hmm.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.543
You made a deal with Cali?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.254
Yes.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.341
Why them?

43:17.428 --> 43:19.138
[scoffs]

43:21.140 --> 43:24.935
I was told you were temperamental.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.191
That's right.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.159
The thing is...

43:44.788 --> 43:47.333
that represents a threat to me, right?

43:49.084 --> 43:50.919
Yeah.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.005
I agree.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.508
If we're being honest,
this will put you out of business.

44:00.137 --> 44:03.223
I could feed you to the hippos.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.895
I don't like Mexicans.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.481
If we're being honest.

44:14.985 --> 44:19.198
If you wanted to kill me,
your men would have shot me on the road.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.497
Hmm.

44:34.505 --> 44:35.339
[clears throat]

44:47.518 --> 44:49.144
[sighs]

45:09.456 --> 45:11.458
Marijuana is a soft product.

45:14.336 --> 45:15.921
It doesn't hurt anyone.

45:17.464 --> 45:22.136
For now, it's illegal,
but in the long run, it will be legalized.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.471
But cocaine is another story.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.516
It scares the Americans.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.437
They believe it's destroying them.

45:34.690 --> 45:39.319
Moving coke will bring you fame
that you can't hide from.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.697
It will make you a target.

45:48.328 --> 45:49.872
Yeah, I already know.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.501
So then, why do it?

45:56.378 --> 46:00.215
-If I don't do it, someone else will.
-Don't come at me with that bullshit.

46:02.718 --> 46:05.387
Why do you want to do it?

46:28.118 --> 46:32.831
When I was 22, I was in love.

46:36.084 --> 46:39.129
My first wife...

46:42.841 --> 46:44.843
she died of leukemia.

46:53.393 --> 46:57.356
We have to control this fucking world.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.816
Or it will control you.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.985
And if you don't protect yourself,
it makes a mess and breaks you.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.498
[exhales]

47:28.679 --> 47:32.266
You are going to take one of our loads...

47:32.808 --> 47:34.560
for every load of theirs.

47:35.394 --> 47:38.188
Half Cali, half us.

47:40.482 --> 47:42.901
And if something gets lost
on the way, brother...

47:44.444 --> 47:46.947
it better be Cali's half.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.369
This will arrive next week.

47:53.412 --> 47:54.788
Are you ready for this?

48:05.757 --> 48:06.967
We're ready.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.557
It's settled then.

48:20.981 --> 48:21.899
Hey...

48:24.985 --> 48:31.283
would you have really fed me
to those hippos? [chuckles]

48:31.366 --> 48:32.242
[Pablo] No.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.827
Hippos...

48:35.537 --> 48:37.623
don't like Mexicans either.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.088
[Blackie] So what?

48:46.590 --> 48:48.425
Do you want a drink or what?

49:28.048 --> 49:29.007
[in Spanish] Good.

49:30.550 --> 49:32.052
And the payments from Tijuana?

49:32.719 --> 49:34.096
You said Juárez.

49:40.185 --> 49:41.853
You are fucking idiots.

Right now.

Hey.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.738
I brought you here for your contacts.

53:21.239 --> 53:22.949
And because you are strong.

53:25.577 --> 53:27.537
I want your advice, Isabella.

You were great today.

I can use you with my business.

53:41.968 --> 53:43.762
I'm not working for free.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.848
Nobody said that.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.439
Think about what you want.

54:02.739 --> 54:04.991
You need a new deal, Miguel.

54:06.660 --> 54:09.704
It's one thing paying the police
to move Mexican dope all over the border,

54:09.788 --> 54:13.750
but it's something else to turn Mexico
into a runway for Colombian coke.

54:14.668 --> 54:17.629
[sighs] If you haven't secured
a deal with the government

54:17.712 --> 54:21.258

-Yeah, I know, this whole show crumbles.

they're moving upwards of 30 million

Look out, you slick-haired motherfucker.

55:13.184 --> 55:16.187
[Félix in Spanish] I had a meeting with
the guys from Cali, then with Escobar.

55:18.523 --> 55:19.691
Then it's true?

55:20.317 --> 55:21.276
[Félix] Yeah.

55:22.902 --> 55:25.113
They're impressed with what we've built.

55:25.655 --> 55:27.991
The money from cocaine
will change everything.

55:29.909 --> 55:32.537

that makes us stronger.

55:35.582 --> 55:36.499
What?!

What we have here is stable.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.671
It's working.

55:42.797 --> 55:44.424
We have control.

55:45.508 --> 55:47.302
And you just give it all away?

55:54.059 --> 55:55.268
These hands...

55:58.897 --> 56:01.191
grow the best weed in the world.

56:02.233 --> 56:04.319
The best weed in the fucking world.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.283
But we don't know shit about cocaine.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.119
Really?

56:14.371 --> 56:17.582
From what I've heard,
you're learning about it pretty quickly.

56:24.297 --> 56:25.423
What's up, brother?

56:26.716 --> 56:27.675
Why?

56:28.760 --> 56:30.345
That's all I want to know.

56:30.929 --> 56:31.846
What's up?

56:31.930 --> 56:35.016
You're not going to stop it. The coke
is coming to Mexico, like it or not.

56:35.100 --> 56:38.019
No, we can stop it
because we are in charge.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.980
This is our shit!

56:45.485 --> 56:46.694
And the Colombians...

56:49.030 --> 56:53.701
we don't want to work for them
and be their delivery boys--

56:53.785 --> 56:57.414
Mexico will be the only way left for
cocaine to come into the United States.

56:58.331 --> 56:59.791
There's the market.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.793
That's our future.

57:02.627 --> 57:04.003
You want to be left out?

57:08.258 --> 57:09.509
I'm sorry, brother...

57:11.803 --> 57:13.138
but I'm against it.

57:16.349 --> 57:17.350
That's fine.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.564
We're moving forward with this.

57:26.401 --> 57:28.611
I'm with Miguel Ángel on this.

57:38.496 --> 57:40.081
That shit is the devil.

57:47.964 --> 57:50.216
You understand where he's coming from?

57:50.300 --> 57:51.217
Yes.

57:52.969 --> 57:56.055
He cares more about some fucking plants
than real business.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.765
He's an artist.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.727
A pain in the ass.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.606
This is a gamble. You know that.

58:05.231 --> 58:10.153
Yeah, well, to be the richest man
in Mexico, you have to risk a little.

58:13.364 --> 58:14.324
Okay.

58:15.575 --> 58:18.620
I'll take Rafa back to Tijuana
to get his weed back.

58:19.829 --> 58:21.789
Put his head right.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.000
I don't give a shit about the load.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.251
It's not right.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.046
Falcón chasing us out of Tijuana
looks bad,

58:28.129 --> 58:29.881
especially with what you've got going on.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.758
It's the wrong time to lose the plaza.

58:36.596 --> 58:38.264
That's fine. Go on ahead.

58:38.806 --> 58:39.807
You're right.

58:49.442 --> 58:50.485
[Don Neto] Miguelito.

58:50.568 --> 58:51.611
Yeah.

58:52.153 --> 58:54.781
Better make sure things work out.

58:56.032 --> 58:57.283
I'll take care of it.

59:03.957 --> 59:05.375
[door closes]

59:16.427 --> 59:17.637
[knock on door]

59:19.764 --> 59:22.475
[in English] Jaime, it's
D.C. Administrator Mullen on the phone.

59:22.976 --> 59:24.561
Thank you, Suzy.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.154
Sir, how are you?

59:35.238 --> 59:39.158
Jaime, it's been awhile.
Sounds like you've been busy down there.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.618
[Jaime chuckles]

59:40.702 --> 59:43.580
You don't know how true that is.
Did you read the Félix Gallardo report?

59:43.663 --> 59:48.251
I did. It's a hell of a read.
Very impressive work.

59:48.334 --> 59:49.627
Well, thank you, sir.

59:51.296 --> 59:53.715
Made a lot of noise around here,
if you want to know the truth.

59:53.798 --> 59:55.717
I suppose that was the plan.

59:55.800 --> 59:56.634
Look, uh...

59:57.719 --> 1:00:00.054
your team's dealing
with a tough situation.

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:01.973
And I know that, believe me.

1:00:02.056 --> 1:00:05.101
You've been given a job to do
and no tools to do it with.

1:00:05.184 --> 1:00:08.896
But our mission
doesn't always get priority.

1:00:08.980 --> 1:00:11.274
Damn near never, in fact.

1:00:11.983 --> 1:00:16.279
Forcing a confrontation on corruption
isn't a play the State Department

1:00:16.362 --> 1:00:19.324
or the folks up here
are comfortable with right now.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:21.909
-Sir?
-There are other factors involved.

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.328
Or so I'm told.

1:00:24.495 --> 1:00:25.622
Other factors?

1:00:26.039 --> 1:00:28.082
Yeah, debt payment for one.

1:00:28.666 --> 1:00:31.044
Wall Street pumped
a shit ton of money into PEMEX

1:00:31.127 --> 1:00:33.296
before the whole oil thing went belly-up.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:37.508
All due respect, sir, I'm more concerned
about my three men and their exposure--

1:00:46.351 --> 1:00:48.102
Look, sir...

1:00:49.354 --> 1:00:52.482
what's happening down here, it's serious.

1:00:53.441 --> 1:00:55.818
Someone has got to start paying attention.

1:00:55.902 --> 1:00:57.570
[Sears]
He's on the phone with D.C.

1:01:01.282 --> 1:01:02.283
[Jaime] Yes, sir.

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:07.163
No, yeah, I-- I do understand that. I do.

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:16.547
Sorry, Jaime.

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:23.179
[slams phone down]

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:36.818
[Tomás in Spanish] Sir.

1:01:44.534 --> 1:01:46.536
Is this something that will make me happy?

1:01:48.329 --> 1:01:49.497
[Tomás]
I doubt it, sir.

1:01:50.915 --> 1:01:53.626
It's from the desk
of the Attorney General's office.

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:58.339
It's what the Americans
have been doing in Guadalajara.

1:02:04.053 --> 1:02:05.430
What the fuck?

1:02:19.902 --> 1:02:21.946
[in English]
Okay, how big you want it, kiddo?

1:02:22.029 --> 1:02:23.197
Big as a pan.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:24.449
[Knapp]
Big as a pan.

1:02:37.336 --> 1:02:39.797
[pop music playing over headphones]

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:41.841
[Knapp] Your eyes are bigger
than your stomach.

1:02:48.890 --> 1:02:49.932
[in Spanish]
Do I know you?

1:02:52.727 --> 1:02:54.395
[Tomás]
Heard of this name?

1:02:55.354 --> 1:02:56.355
No.

1:02:56.439 --> 1:03:00.109
[Knapp in English]
These are the best I've ever made.

1:03:00.193 --> 1:03:01.402
Look how perfect they are.

1:03:01.486 --> 1:03:02.737
Billy, help your sister.

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:10.620
[in Spanish]
No, wait! What are you doing--

1:03:10.703 --> 1:03:12.413
[screaming]

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:15.208
I swear to God,
if you don't take those out--

1:03:15.291 --> 1:03:16.375
-[gunshots]
-[screams]

1:03:16.918 --> 1:03:18.461
[Knapp]
Get down! Get down!

1:03:18.544 --> 1:03:21.005
Come here! Sweetie, get down! Get down!

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:25.843
Okay, stay here. Don't move. Be quiet.

1:03:25.927 --> 1:03:28.596
Be quiet. Be-- Right there. Right there.

1:03:29.138 --> 1:03:30.890
I got it. I got it. Okay.

1:03:30.973 --> 1:03:32.350
[cocks gun]

1:03:32.433 --> 1:03:35.561
-[girl whimpers]
-[woman] Shh, shh.

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:56.958
[car doors closing]

1:03:57.041 --> 1:03:59.377
[car engines starting]

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.043
[in English]
We talked to his wife.

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:47.466
Kiki.

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:50.845
It ain't your fault.

1:04:52.597 --> 1:04:53.764
It's our fault.

1:04:56.142 --> 1:04:57.685
Our people gave him up.

1:04:58.436 --> 1:05:00.062
I told him we wouldn't, but, uh...

1:05:01.063 --> 1:05:02.273
but we did.

1:05:05.192 --> 1:05:06.444
What about Knapp?

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:09.530
Moved to a safehouse.

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:12.074
Rita and the kids are pretty shook up.

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:13.492
They're sending him home.

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:17.705
Our guy takes a fucking shot,
and he gets sent packing.

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:20.583
It's the embassy's call.
Regulations. You know the drill.

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:23.920
[Sears] Yeah, but they're not sending
a replacement. That's not the drill.

1:05:24.253 --> 1:05:26.130
What the fuck are we doing here?

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.759
We're way out in front
and nobody's behind us.

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:32.428
Yeah? We gave 'em everything.

1:05:32.511 --> 1:05:36.265
Account numbers, balances,
the whole thing. They don't give a shit.

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.066
We use that report a different way.

1:05:46.484 --> 1:05:48.778
Those accounts in Texas,
Félix holds them under a fake name.

1:05:48.861 --> 1:05:51.530
That right there is what?
It's bank fraud, wire fraud--

1:05:51.614 --> 1:05:52.907
Shit, racketeering?

1:05:54.325 --> 1:05:55.660
We get him up there.

1:05:56.911 --> 1:05:58.955
'Cause fuck here. Fuck Mexico.

1:06:01.290 --> 1:06:02.625
We lure him across the border.

1:06:03.376 --> 1:06:04.835
Arrest him in America.

1:06:06.087 --> 1:06:07.964
Cuff that motherfucker ourselves.

1:06:10.508 --> 1:06:11.634
Okay.

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:14.387
You got any ideas how we do that?

1:07:06.272 --> 1:07:07.773
