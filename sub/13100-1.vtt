[whooshing]

00:14.833 --> 00:16.375
(Sheridan)
Ambassador.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.333
I've been looking for you.

00:20.417 --> 00:21.500
Uh..

00:23.125 --> 00:26.208
Last week
after you saved my life

00:26.292 --> 00:29.792
I didn't really get a chance
to thank you properly.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.375
I've tried to reach you
since then

00:31.458 --> 00:34.917
but, uh, you haven't
answered my calls.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.542
Is everything alright?

00:37.708 --> 00:41.292
Being seen by so many at once

00:41.375 --> 00:44.000
was a great strain.

00:44.083 --> 00:47.000
I returned to my ship to rest.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.083
You have a question?

00:55.042 --> 00:57.375
Nobody knows it was you.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.667
Everyone saw
something different.

00:59.750 --> 01:04.000
Something from the, the legends
of their own world.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.625
But it was still
a terrible risk.

01:06.708 --> 01:10.625
After taking such, such care
to hide what you really are

01:10.708 --> 01:12.417
why take that chance?

01:13.958 --> 01:16.708
It was necessary.

01:20.292 --> 01:21.875
Well, as answers go

01:21.958 --> 01:25.083
short, to the point,
utterly useless

01:25.167 --> 01:26.583
and totally consistent

01:26.667 --> 01:29.000
with what I've come
to expect from a Vorlon.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.625
Good.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.500
You know, I just had a thought.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.458
'You've been back and forth
to your homeworld'

01:40.542 --> 01:42.333
so many times
since you got here.

01:42.417 --> 01:44.792
How do I know
you're the same Vorlon?

01:44.875 --> 01:47.417
Inside that encounter suit,
you could be anyone.

01:48.417 --> 01:51.292
I have always been here.

01:51.375 --> 01:54.042
Oh, yeah? You said
that about me too.

01:55.292 --> 01:56.500
Yes.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.750
I really hate it
when you do that.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.625
Good.

02:19.458 --> 02:22.083
[gunfire]

02:23.250 --> 02:25.708
Approaching the barrier.
Are you ready?

02:25.792 --> 02:28.708
- 'Standing by.'
- Here it comes.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.875
[gunfire continues]

02:37.667 --> 02:40.250
- Almost there.
- 'Eject me.'

02:40.333 --> 02:42.500
- 'Don't take the chance.'
- Not yet.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.958
Get you all the way
outside the barrier.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.375
(male #1)
'Now.'

02:49.458 --> 02:50.417
'Now.'

02:50.500 --> 02:53.208
- 'Damn it, now.'
- Now.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.292
[zapping]

02:58.333 --> 02:59.792
Good luck.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.250
Goodbye, Drasak.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.958
Can we still jump?

[intense music]

03:34.417 --> 03:39.375
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last, best hope for peace.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.292
It failed.

03:58.958 --> 04:00.625
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:00.708 --> 04:02.958
it became something greater.

04:03.042 --> 04:06.333
Our last best hope
for victory.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.917
The year is 2260.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.708

as you can

from life support
to the engines.

[music continues]

05:30.667 --> 05:32.667
(Sheridan)
You know, I'm getting
a little tired of these

05:32.750 --> 05:34.583
unannounced visits by VIPs

05:34.667 --> 05:36.042
who will not tell us
why they're coming

05:36.125 --> 05:37.792
or what they're gonna do
when they get here.

05:37.875 --> 05:40.042
Well, leave it to you to try and
take all the fun out of life.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.292
I mean, come on, where's your
sense of mystery, of adventure?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.917
- Are you trying to cheer me up?
- No, sir. Wouldn't dream of it.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.750
Good. I hate being cheered up.
It's depressing.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.750
Well, in that case,
we're all gonna die

05:49.833 --> 05:52.208
horrible, painful,
lingering deaths.

05:52.292 --> 05:54.917
Thank you.
I feel so much better now.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.083
Captain Sheridan.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.750
Commander Ivanova.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.917
David Endawi, Earthforce
Special Intelligence Division.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.750
Sorry to jump in on you
at the last moment

06:03.833 --> 06:06.792
but I only got my orders
a few days ago.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.958
Can we go someplace private?

06:09.042 --> 06:11.583
What I have to say
is for your ears only.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.667
Of course, uh, this way.

06:13.750 --> 06:14.958
I'd appreciate it
if you could have

06:15.042 --> 06:16.708
Ambassador Delenn
present as well?

06:16.792 --> 06:18.958
Not a problem.
I'll have her meet us there.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.583
- I got a new one for you, doc.
- Yeah, what is it?

06:23.667 --> 06:25.208
(Garibaldi)
Uh, he just got off the ship
when he collapsed.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.500
The ship was shot up pretty bad.
I checked the cockpit.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.500
He practically turned off
his life-support systems.

06:29.583 --> 06:32.000
My guess is he was saving energy
to make sure he got here.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.708
- Any idea why?
- Uh, negative.

06:33.792 --> 06:36.208
He must have erased the ship's
log before he docked.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.875
Like the new digs.
Just move in?

06:37.958 --> 06:39.250
Yeah, this morning.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.125
Still trying to sort
the place out though.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.792
Definite improvement.

06:45.042 --> 06:47.208
Alright, we'll have Dr. Sanchez
do a full workup.

06:47.292 --> 06:49.375
We'll let you know
when he comes to.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.667
Okay.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.625
[dramatic music]

07:06.542 --> 07:09.625
- Franklin to, uh, Sanchez.
- 'Sanchez.'

07:09.708 --> 07:12.208
Got a patient here. Medlab 1.
Can you get up here stat?

07:12.292 --> 07:14.458
- 'Is it serious?'
- I don't think so.

07:14.542 --> 07:17.667
Looks like, uh, exhaustion

07:17.750 --> 07:19.667
dehydration,
oxygen deprivation.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.458
Believe me,
he's not going anywhere.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.542
(Sanchez on speaker)
'I'm on my way.'

07:33.250 --> 07:35.167
Good morning, ambassador.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.375
I hear you've been
looking for me.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.917
Yes. Please.

07:40.958 --> 07:45.542
I have been doing a great deal
of thinking lately.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.333
With the Narn War over

07:48.417 --> 07:51.750
I think it is time that we..

07:51.833 --> 07:54.417
...reconsidered
our relationship.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.167
How?

07:56.250 --> 07:59.500
My people have
a manifest destiny.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.333
They can achieve it just as well

08:01.417 --> 08:04.458
without the help of your
associates, perhaps better.

08:04.542 --> 08:07.958
- So we're no longer necessary?
- That's right.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.375
And now that
we've done everything

08:09.458 --> 08:13.625
that you have asked,
you'd like us to just disappear?

08:13.708 --> 08:17.333
I do believe you have got it
surrounded, Mr. Morden.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.792
Aren't you being
a little premature?

08:21.875 --> 08:23.625
After all, your people
are still moving in

08:23.708 --> 08:25.583
on several other worlds.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.042
You might still need us.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.417
No, I don't think so.

08:31.833 --> 08:36.833
We have danced our last
little dance, Mr. Morden.

08:37.958 --> 08:42.417
Now it is time for you
to go away.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.333
Okay.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.750
There is one small
detail, ambassador.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.083
A little bookkeeping
to close out.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.667
I have to meet
with my associates

09:03.750 --> 09:06.333
but let's say,
we reconvene in your quarters

09:06.417 --> 09:08.458
later this afternoon
to discuss it.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.667
And then you'll go away?

09:11.708 --> 09:13.792
For as long as you want.

09:18.583 --> 09:23.042
(Endawi)
I am here on a matter of
the utmost urgency, ambassador.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.958
'Before I leave,
I will be speaking'

09:25.042 --> 09:26.792
with most
of the other ambassadors

09:26.875 --> 09:29.875
but I wanted to see you first

09:29.958 --> 09:33.542
because of our current
good relations with Minbar

09:33.625 --> 09:37.833
and because
as one of the older races

09:37.917 --> 09:41.417
you might have some knowledge
of the subject at hand.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.125
I will, of course,
do anything I can.

09:49.042 --> 09:52.333
Some of you may already
have seen this on ISN.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.583
We yanked it off the air
as soon as we heard about it.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.083
This is gun-camera footage

09:57.167 --> 09:59.875
from one of your starfuries,
is it not?

09:59.958 --> 10:02.333
Yes. Lieutenant Keffer.

10:02.417 --> 10:05.208
He was conducting a series
of unauthorized investigations

10:05.292 --> 10:08.625
into an unknown ship
he'd seen in hyperspace.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.042
It cost him his life.

10:11.125 --> 10:15.083
Then you had no knowledge
of his investigation?

10:15.167 --> 10:17.000
He didn't talk about it much.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.750
We heard about it
and tried to discourage him

10:18.833 --> 10:20.417
from continuing,
but he disobeyed.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.792
Yeah.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.042
Was he authorized
for a first contact protocol?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.250
No.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.875
Ambassador, our research
division has been studying

10:30.958 --> 10:33.042
'this record
for the last ten days.'

10:33.125 --> 10:35.708
It's hard to gauge size
in hyperspace

10:35.792 --> 10:38.042
but it's big and it's powerful

10:38.125 --> 10:40.625
and it is totally unknown to us.

10:40.708 --> 10:44.208
'It attacked and killed
one of our pilots.'

10:44.292 --> 10:47.083
'It's clearly from a highly
advanced civilization.'

10:47.167 --> 10:50.708
We're downplaying this at home
trying to convince the public

10:50.792 --> 10:52.542
that we know what it is,
where it's from

10:52.625 --> 10:57.500
and that we're not worried,
but we don't have a clue.

10:57.583 --> 11:01.042
My job is to find out what
you or any of the other races

11:01.125 --> 11:03.083
'know about this ship.'

11:04.958 --> 11:06.208
I'm sorry, Mr. Endawi.

11:06.292 --> 11:08.083
I wish I could be
of some help to you

11:08.167 --> 11:12.083
but, uh, this is the first time
I've seen a ship like this.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.875
You're sure?

11:13.958 --> 11:16.000
Take a good look.

11:18.542 --> 11:21.625
[instrumental music]

11:31.417 --> 11:34.917
Yes, I'm quite sure.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.125
I assume nothing like this has
entered Babylon 5 space lately?

11:39.208 --> 11:42.875
No. If there was something
like that, I'd recognize it.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.417
Alright.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.750
Well, I shouldn't have expected
to hit it right off the bat.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.917
I'll need to speak
with all the other ambassadors

11:50.042 --> 11:53.125
about this, captain,
strictly on the QT.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.292
'This may take a while'

11:54.375 --> 11:56.208
'so if you could find me
a place to stay.'

11:56.292 --> 11:57.875
That's already been
taken care of.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.333
If you'll just follow me.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.917
Thank you.

12:04.042 --> 12:05.375
(Endawi)
Ambassador.

12:09.958 --> 12:13.250
A few months ago, you told me
about an ancient race.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.750
The Shadows.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.333
This is one of theirs,
isn't it?

12:20.375 --> 12:22.792
I'm sorry I could not
tell him the truth.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.000
But our only chance is
in allowing the Shadows

12:25.083 --> 12:27.167
to think that we are unaware
of their return

12:27.250 --> 12:29.125
while we prepare our own forces.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.000
But you said
you'd never seen one before?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.042
That part was true.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.000
Descriptions of these ships

12:35.083 --> 12:38.083
have come down to us
from the last great war.

12:38.167 --> 12:41.125
I have never actually seen one
until this moment.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.000
'These ships..'

12:45.083 --> 12:47.833
'...once they target you..'

12:47.917 --> 12:51.417
...they never stop,
never slow down, never give up

12:51.500 --> 12:53.542
until they have destroyed you.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.125
They are nearly invincible.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.500
I don't believe that.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.792
Every ship has a weakness.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.917
Believe what you will

13:02.000 --> 13:04.417
till experience
changes your mind.

13:06.167 --> 13:09.792
Take a good look, John,
and remember it well.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.708
That is the face of our enemy.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.500
[dramatic music]

13:23.750 --> 13:26.417
Delenn.
Good. There you are.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.708
I was just informed that
someone is looking for you.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.292
Oh, this is not
a good time, Lenny.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.833
Uh..

13:31.917 --> 13:33.750
He sent this.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.208
I appreciate your seeing me

13:45.292 --> 13:47.625
on such short notice,
Ambassador Mollari.

13:47.708 --> 13:50.208
Nonsense,
even before our new treaty

13:50.292 --> 13:51.708
there's nothing
I would not do

13:51.792 --> 13:53.958
for my dear friends
from Earth.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.792
Now, you are sure
you will not have a drink?

13:56.875 --> 13:59.167
Not while I'm on duty.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.292
Well, you see, we, Centauri

14:03.375 --> 14:05.333
are always on duty.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.792
Duty to the Republic,
to our houses

14:08.875 --> 14:10.750
to one another.

14:10.833 --> 14:15.083
And so we have made
the practice of joy..

14:15.167 --> 14:18.625
...another duty,
one which must be pursued

14:18.708 --> 14:20.958
as vigorously as the others.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.958
[laughs]
You should try it sometime.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.583
Now, what can I do
to be of service?

14:31.667 --> 14:36.083
I was wondering what you might
know about this ship.

14:37.833 --> 14:42.042
We salvaged this record
from a destroyed Earth fighter.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.917
We've never seen
anything like it.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.042
Given its strength, its size

14:47.125 --> 14:49.583
'and its apparent hostility'

14:49.667 --> 14:52.500
'until we know otherwise,
we are considering it'

14:52.583 --> 14:54.792
a threat
to planetary security.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.083
Can you tell me
if you've seen this before?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.625
Yes.

14:59.708 --> 15:00.792
In a dream.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.167
A dream?

15:05.708 --> 15:06.917
I..

15:07.750 --> 15:09.250
I'm standing..

15:11.542 --> 15:14.708
...somewhere on Centauri Prime,
I think.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.750
And I'm..

15:16.833 --> 15:18.292
...looking up.

15:19.917 --> 15:21.917
And there are ships..

15:22.667 --> 15:24.750
...just like this..

15:25.583 --> 15:28.625
...passing overhead.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.125
First, a few..

15:33.083 --> 15:34.708
...and then more.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.792
A thousand, two thousand.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.917
So many that they blot
out the sun.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.917
A terrible sight.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.000
Terrible.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.042
That's all?

15:57.917 --> 15:59.458
It is enough.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.292
Now that is all I know.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.458
I'm sorry I could not
be of more assistance.

16:09.542 --> 16:12.000
Perhaps one of the others.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.375
Yes, of course.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.500
Thank you for your time,
Ambassador Mollari.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.583
Are you sure this is the place?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.333
Reasonably.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.708
A most unreasonable place
for reasonable assumptions.

16:33.208 --> 16:36.250
[glass clinking]

16:38.792 --> 16:41.875
[indistinct chatter]

16:54.833 --> 16:57.708
- Drink.
- Uh, thank you, no.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.000
Now if you please,
we are waiting for someone.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.125
People come here to drink.
Do you want to draw attention?

17:13.042 --> 17:15.708
No alcohol.
It is safe.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.792
- Mister?
- Just Marcus.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.625
Of course, it's safe.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.250
I know the effect
it has on Minbari.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.792
But since most don't

17:23.875 --> 17:26.292
I figured it would help prove
I was waiting for you.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.500
Can I have it back now, please?

17:34.042 --> 17:36.958
Do you know, I've heard
that when these are made

17:37.042 --> 17:39.625
they're forged
in white-hot flame

17:39.708 --> 17:42.333
then cooled in three bowls.

17:42.417 --> 17:46.083
The first is some kind
of ancient holy water.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.792
The second, Minbari blood.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.542
The third, human blood.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.542
They say that when a ranger dies

17:53.625 --> 17:56.542
the figures on either side
shed three tears.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.333
One of water and two of blood.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.625
And you?
Do you believe this?

18:01.708 --> 18:04.750
I stopped believing in miracles
a long time ago, ambassador.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.292
Part of the heart goes dead.
It's best to leave it that way.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.125
I need your help, Delenn.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.083
'But I suggest we go someplace'

18:17.167 --> 18:19.667
a little more private
to discuss it.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.792
This way.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.250
[dramatic music]

18:43.458 --> 18:46.667
- We're being followed.
- Yes, I know.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.667
This is my party Downbelow.

18:52.750 --> 18:56.625
You wanna do business here,
you gotta pay.

18:56.708 --> 18:59.458
- I don't like extortion.
- And I don't like insults.

18:59.542 --> 19:00.958
Funny, with a face like yours

19:01.042 --> 19:03.292
I thought you would be
used to it by now.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.375
It's a bad move.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.542
All you had to do was give us
everything you got.

19:07.625 --> 19:11.458
Now, you're still gonna give us
everything you got

19:11.542 --> 19:13.833
only it's gonna hurt
a hell of a lot worse.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.458
[grunts]

19:19.917 --> 19:22.958
[dramatic music]

19:34.875 --> 19:37.625
- You alright?
- Yes.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.417
Yes. Lennier? Lennier?

19:40.500 --> 19:43.250
I'm fine.
Thank you, Delenn.

19:43.333 --> 19:46.500
A Minbari fighting pike.
An old one.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.417
A gift from a friend.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.417
We must hurry. This way.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.417
- Captain, you wanted to see me?
- Yes, commander, um..

20:13.875 --> 20:15.083
It's gonna be difficult.

20:15.167 --> 20:17.583
Um, I haven't had a chance
to fill you in

20:17.667 --> 20:21.167
on everything until now
and I apologize for that.

20:22.292 --> 20:23.833
But from what I've just heard

20:23.917 --> 20:26.375
we don't have a lot of time.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.333
This is Marcus. He's a--

20:28.417 --> 20:30.542
A ranger, they've been
trained to fight the Shadows

20:30.625 --> 20:33.333
and keep an eye on what's
happening outside Babylon 5.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.583
'The rangers in this area
are under the direct control'

20:35.667 --> 20:37.833
'of you, Ambassador Delenn'

20:37.917 --> 20:40.542
'and Garibaldi is functioning
as your liaison.'

20:42.292 --> 20:44.458
Did I leave anything out?

20:44.542 --> 20:46.708
Ah, when did you, how did you--

20:46.792 --> 20:48.417
Captain, the day something
happens around here

20:48.500 --> 20:50.417
and I don't know
about it, worry.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.625
'So what's up?'

20:54.250 --> 20:55.417
Marcus?

20:55.500 --> 20:58.167
I came here from Zagros 7.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.333
It's a Drazi colony
on the edge of their territory.

21:00.417 --> 21:03.250
It's also the base for one
of our biggest training camps.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.500
I thought the rangers
were being trained on Minbar?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.375
(Lennier)
'Many of them are, yes.'

21:07.458 --> 21:10.042
But there is a wisdom in,
as you say

21:10.125 --> 21:13.208
not putting all of your eggs
in one basket.

21:13.292 --> 21:14.958
Besides, not all of our people

21:15.042 --> 21:17.375
are comfortable with the idea
of the rangers.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.333
So with the cooperation
of other governments

21:19.417 --> 21:22.167
we've created additional
training camps elsewhere.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.167
Two weeks ago,
we were surrounded

21:24.250 --> 21:26.708
by Centauri blockade mines.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.250
Any ship trying to leave
the blockade is shot down.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.875
It's a small colony
with very little a value

21:33.958 --> 21:36.042
so our guess is that
we're the target.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.375
Why hasn't the Drazi government
done anything about this?

21:38.458 --> 21:40.708
The Centauri have captured
much larger targets

21:40.792 --> 21:42.667
on the other side
of their territory.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.750
They do not have resources
to protect a colony

21:44.833 --> 21:47.750
with so few people and of such
limited strategic value.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.750
We're boxed in on all sides.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.542
We need your help now

21:52.625 --> 21:54.958
before anyone else is killed
or the camp is invaded.

21:55.042 --> 21:57.667
All you have to do is break
the blockade long enough

21:57.750 --> 21:59.750
for the other rangers to escape.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.125
Look, to lead an expedition
into Drazi space

22:02.208 --> 22:03.625
and take out
a planetary blockade

22:03.708 --> 22:05.875
you'd need a warship,
major ordinance, a crew.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.542
'We don't have those
kind of resources.'

22:07.625 --> 22:09.333
'And we're already in hot water
with the Centauri'

22:09.417 --> 22:10.833
'over the last firefight.'

22:10.917 --> 22:14.500
We have the means
if you have the will.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.500
'There'll be nothing left behind
that can be linked back to you.'

22:18.500 --> 22:20.458
We have no one else to turn to.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.250
(Ivanova)
And, captain,
there's one more thing.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.708
We still have a VIP onboard.

22:26.792 --> 22:29.042
You leave now, it's gonna raise
ten kinds of hell.

22:33.667 --> 22:37.750
When I agreed to share command
of the rangers with Delenn

22:37.833 --> 22:40.625
I became responsible
for their well-being.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.875
And I'm not going
to abandon them now.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.583
Michael, I'm leaving you
in charge of Mr. Endawi.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.083
'Tell him anything. Just buy me
as much time as you can.'

22:50.167 --> 22:51.250
Will do.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.083
Now we've spent
too much time reacting

22:53.167 --> 22:55.875
when we should've been acting.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.458
Let's take the offensive
for a change.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.667
'Fire up the shuttle,
commander.'

23:01.708 --> 23:03.500
We've got work to do.

23:06.042 --> 23:09.042
[dramatic music]

23:10.583 --> 23:13.375
I just sent a fake destination
to the station files.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.792
We can proceed
to Zagros 7 anytime.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.042
Shuttle One to Minbari flyer.

23:18.125 --> 23:21.208
Stay close.
Initiating jumpgate sequence.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.667
[whooshing]

23:28.667 --> 23:30.958
(Morden)
Since you feel strongly
about going our separate ways

23:31.042 --> 23:32.458
I wanted to be sure
we understood

23:32.542 --> 23:34.875
the terms of our separation.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.167
Ah, here we are.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.042
This area over here
is for the Centauri.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.875
Conquer all the worlds you like,
we won't bother you

23:45.958 --> 23:50.000
as long as it's understood
that this area is ours.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.750
'You can take anything
you want over here'

23:51.833 --> 23:53.417
and we'll take everything
we want over there.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.625
Yes, and what guarantee
do we have

23:55.708 --> 23:59.167
that your forces will not decide
to turn around and attack us?

23:59.250 --> 24:00.333
None.

24:00.417 --> 24:02.208
Ambassador, we both know

24:02.292 --> 24:04.583
what promises in treaties mean.

24:04.667 --> 24:06.875
All I can tell you is
we have what we want.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.333
The rest is of no concern to us.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.000
Done.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.667
We go our separate ways

24:15.750 --> 24:18.583
and we owe each other nothing.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.292
Of course.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.417
Oh, uh, one small exception
hardly worth mentioning.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.000
Uh, this world.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.375
'It's on the border
of your space'

24:27.458 --> 24:29.375
'but we have a vested
interest in it.'

24:29.458 --> 24:32.542
I've taken the liberty of asking
Lord Refa to secure it for us.

24:32.625 --> 24:34.375
Refa?

24:34.458 --> 24:37.417
Well, you said you wanted
nothing more to do with us

24:37.500 --> 24:41.333
and he was quite open
to my request.

24:41.417 --> 24:43.625
He secured the planet for us
and now my associates

24:43.708 --> 24:45.542
'will take custody of it.'

24:45.625 --> 24:47.917
The rest is yours.
Good day, ambassador.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.208
Mr. Morden.

24:50.292 --> 24:52.625
I was thinking..

24:52.708 --> 24:54.292
...I have never really
seen the ships

24:54.375 --> 24:59.583
that you and your associates
have used in, in helping us.

24:59.667 --> 25:02.250
- Perhaps one of these days--
- Perhaps.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.250
Meanwhile, as I said

25:04.333 --> 25:06.667
tell your forces
to leave the blockade mines

25:06.750 --> 25:09.542
but to move their ships
out of that area.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.500
You don't want them
or anyone else hanging around

25:11.583 --> 25:14.292
when my associates come
for Zagros 7.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.250
(Delenn)
'We're approaching
the rendezvous point.'

25:24.333 --> 25:26.500
'Prepare for return
to normal space.'

25:26.583 --> 25:28.708
Confirmed, ambassador.

25:28.792 --> 25:30.083
Would you like to tell us

25:30.167 --> 25:31.958
what's waiting for us
on the other side?

25:32.958 --> 25:34.292
A beginning.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.583
[dramatic music]

25:42.333 --> 25:44.250
(Ivanova)
Scanning area.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.167
I'm not seeing anything, but..

25:48.250 --> 25:49.958
Wait, I've got a..

25:50.042 --> 25:51.750
What the hell is that?

25:56.042 --> 25:58.125
(Sheridan)
'My God.'

25:58.208 --> 25:59.542
'It's beautiful.'

26:00.625 --> 26:02.750
Her name is The White Star.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.917
And she's yours, captain.

26:14.917 --> 26:17.042
(Endawi)
'This is quite irregular,
Mr. Garibaldi.'

26:17.125 --> 26:18.625
I was assured
that Captain Sheridan

26:18.708 --> 26:20.625
or Commander Ivanova
would be available.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.167
They got called away
on urgent business.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.625
What kind of business?

26:23.708 --> 26:25.583
I'm not authorized
for that kind of information.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.875
But you're the head
of security.

26:27.958 --> 26:29.458
And what kind of head
of security would I be

26:29.542 --> 26:31.042
if I let people like me
know things

26:31.125 --> 26:32.583
that I'm not supposed to know?

26:32.667 --> 26:34.500
I mean, I know what I know
because I have to know it

26:34.583 --> 26:36.417
and if I don't have to know it,
I don't tell me

26:36.500 --> 26:38.167
and I don't let anyone else
tell me either.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.875
Now look, we've tried most
of the other ambassadors.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.167
Why don't you speak to G'Kar?

26:41.250 --> 26:42.750
Maybe he knows something
about the ship.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.750
Under the terms
of our recent treaty

26:44.833 --> 26:47.500
I am not authorized to have
any official conversation

26:47.583 --> 26:49.958
with the Narn
without Centauri approval.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.375
So you'll ask unofficially.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.042
And I can give you
reasonable assurances that

26:53.125 --> 26:56.500
the head of security will not
report you for doing so.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.167
Because you won't tell
yourself about it?

26:59.250 --> 27:01.500
I try never to get
involved in my own life.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.792
Too much trouble.

27:03.875 --> 27:07.292
This is a very strange place
you have here, Mr. Garibaldi.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.208
Thank you.

27:13.042 --> 27:16.333
(Delenn)
'The White Star is a new breed
of Minbari warship.'

27:16.417 --> 27:18.042
Smaller than our
other fleet ships

27:18.125 --> 27:20.542
and faster than
anything else her size.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.833
It uses both Minbari
and Vorlon technology.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.917
Most important, unlike
other vessels her size

27:29.000 --> 27:31.708
this one can make its own
jump point into hyperspace.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.417
Very nice, and it looks
just different enough

27:33.500 --> 27:35.208
so that it won't be recognized
as a Minbari ship.

27:35.292 --> 27:37.500
- Yes, exactly.
- I'll take two.

27:37.583 --> 27:40.042
I've noticed you have
artificial gravity.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.958
Our ships have to use
rotating sections.

27:43.042 --> 27:44.417
Her drive systems
are based partly

27:44.500 --> 27:47.042
on magnetic
and gravitational principles.

27:47.125 --> 27:50.583
Uh, we've had artificial gravity
for some time now.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.458
- This way.
- Hmm.

27:59.125 --> 28:02.625
Because we've had some problems
recently with the warrior caste

28:02.708 --> 28:05.625
we've chosen a crew
from the religious caste.

28:05.708 --> 28:08.875
Many of them helped design
this ship working in secret.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.750
Even some in the Grey Council
do not know about this.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.792
It's amazing, Delenn.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.083
I could spend the next couple
of days taking this thing apart

28:16.167 --> 28:17.625
to learn how it works.

28:17.708 --> 28:21.042
But we don't have time for that
right now. Who do I, um..

28:21.125 --> 28:24.083
The others are not yet familiar
with your language

28:24.167 --> 28:27.292
but I'll be happy to relay your
orders to the crew, captain.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.083
(Sheridan)
'Thank you, Mr. Lennier.'

28:29.167 --> 28:32.292
Put us on course for Zagros 7.

28:32.375 --> 28:35.292
[speaking in foreign language]

28:36.958 --> 28:40.000
[whooshing]

28:42.208 --> 28:45.000
So I know it is a long shot,
Mr. G'Kar

28:45.083 --> 28:46.458
but if there is anything

28:46.542 --> 28:49.458
you could tell us
about this ship.

28:52.667 --> 28:53.958
Finally.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.083
'They came to our world'

29:14.167 --> 29:16.750
'over a thousand
of your years ago.'

29:16.833 --> 29:20.667
Long before we went
to the stars ourselves.

29:20.750 --> 29:24.250
They set up a base on one
of our southern continents.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.750
They took little
interest in us.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.458
G'Quan believed
they were engaged in a war

29:29.542 --> 29:32.000
far outside our own world.

29:32.083 --> 29:33.417
G'Quan?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.625
One of our greatest
spiritual leaders.

29:35.708 --> 29:38.667
"The Book Of G'Quan"
is copied by hand

29:38.750 --> 29:43.625
from the original with every
note and line precisely drawn.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.792
This ship and your ship
are the same.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.458
I tried to warn the others

29:50.542 --> 29:52.958
that the ancient enemy
was returning.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.333
But no one listened.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.292
Perhaps now they will.

29:58.375 --> 30:00.208
But if this is correct

30:00.292 --> 30:04.500
why would they just disappear
for a thousand years?

30:05.708 --> 30:09.125
To all things, there is a time,
Mr. Endawi.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.625
Perhaps this is theirs.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.500
[intense music]

30:17.458 --> 30:20.542
[devices chiming]

30:26.125 --> 30:28.250
You haven't said much
since we came aboard.

30:28.333 --> 30:31.083
I don't usually speak
unless I have something to say.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.708
Then we have
something in common.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.708
So how did you get involved
with the rangers?

30:35.792 --> 30:38.250
My brother joined six months
before I did.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.458
I said he was being a fool

30:41.542 --> 30:44.333
'chasing legends,
playing hero.'

30:46.833 --> 30:48.583
He came back to warn me
about a Shadow attack

30:48.667 --> 30:51.042
on the mining colony
I was working at.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.833
I didn't listen.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.875
I got back just in time
to see him die.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.792
I'm sorry.

31:03.875 --> 31:07.417
Before he died, he asked me
to finish what he'd started.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.333
I keep my promises.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.917
(Lennier)
'Approaching Zagros 7.'

31:13.000 --> 31:15.208
'Coming out of hyperspace.'

31:16.750 --> 31:19.833
[intense music]

31:26.042 --> 31:27.458
Are the other rangers ready?

31:27.542 --> 31:29.333
I sent them a message
as soon as we came aboard.

31:29.417 --> 31:32.208
Good. Ivanova, you finished
studying the weapon system?

31:32.292 --> 31:33.917
- Ready when you are.
- Keep scanning.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.292
There's bound to be
a Centauri warship

31:35.375 --> 31:36.750
hanging around
to keep an eye on things

31:36.833 --> 31:39.625
and I do not wanna get caught
in a crossfire.

31:39.708 --> 31:40.917
Let's go.

31:42.542 --> 31:43.833
[speaking in foreign language]

31:48.333 --> 31:49.500
Fire.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.500
[zapping]

31:52.583 --> 31:53.875
[explosion]

31:56.542 --> 31:58.667
They're getting our range.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.458
Still no sign
of a Centauri warship?

32:00.542 --> 32:02.333
None.

32:02.417 --> 32:03.667
I don't like it.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.083
They wouldn't just abandon
a blockade like this.

32:06.167 --> 32:07.750
Unless they recalled it.

32:07.833 --> 32:10.250
And just leave all of this
behind unprotected?

32:10.333 --> 32:12.417
That doesn't make sense.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.333
Are you sure all your scanners
are working properly?

32:17.458 --> 32:18.750
Would you like
to see for yourself?

32:18.833 --> 32:20.042
Yes.

32:21.875 --> 32:24.917
[dramatic music]

32:32.250 --> 32:34.458
Oh, this is..

32:34.542 --> 32:35.792
This is wo..

32:35.875 --> 32:38.000
Delenn, what else
can this ship do?

32:38.083 --> 32:41.708
All in good time, captain.
All in good time.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.250
We're picking up a disturbance.
One ship.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.917
Unknown configuration.

32:47.167 --> 32:48.208
Show me.

32:52.417 --> 32:53.792
(Delenn)
'Shadows.'

32:58.542 --> 33:00.000
In Valen's name.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.417
[music continues]

33:09.500 --> 33:11.667
They've got to be here
for the same reasons we are.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.333
The rangers.

33:13.417 --> 33:14.875
You can't abandon
them down there.

33:14.958 --> 33:17.458
I have no intention
of abandoning anyone.

33:17.542 --> 33:18.958
How many more of these mines
do we have to take out

33:19.042 --> 33:20.583
before the rangers can escape?

33:20.667 --> 33:21.750
The next three should give them

33:21.833 --> 33:23.083
a big enough a window
to get out.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.500
We're not ready for this yet.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.625
Then we'd better
get ready and fast.

33:26.708 --> 33:29.667
We came this far. We're gonna
finish what we started.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.208
- Continue attack.
- 'Aye, sir.'

33:33.500 --> 33:34.708
[speaking in foreign language]

33:38.333 --> 33:39.917
Enemy vessel's targeting us.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.792
Evasive action, but keep firing.

33:43.208 --> 33:46.083
[zapping]

33:49.500 --> 33:50.542
They missed.

33:52.333 --> 33:53.833
They never miss.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.958
Wait, they don't recognize
our ship.

33:59.042 --> 34:01.958
They wanna find out who we are
before they destroy us.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.667
They'll either cripple us,
so they can board us

34:03.750 --> 34:06.750
or drive us off
so they can follow us.

34:06.833 --> 34:09.250
That should give us
just enough room to maneuver.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.875
We've got the last mine
in this area cleared.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.833
Marcus, there's your window.
Tell the rangers to clear out.

34:21.042 --> 34:22.792
[explosion]

34:22.875 --> 34:24.542
Alright, head for the jumpgate.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.667
Would it not be faster
to open a jump point?

34:26.750 --> 34:28.667
I don't want them to know
we have that potential.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.958
Now hit it.

34:30.042 --> 34:31.458
We cannot lose them
in hyperspace.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.542
They will follow us
wherever we go.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.125
I'm counting on it.

34:38.583 --> 34:41.625
[whooshing]

34:45.542 --> 34:48.667
- 'It's still there, captain.'
- Good.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.208
Listen to me, captain.

34:50.292 --> 34:52.125
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.083
This weapons in this ship
aren't strong enough

34:54.167 --> 34:56.083
to hurt a Shadow vessel
of that size.

34:56.167 --> 34:57.375
We must find help.

34:57.458 --> 35:00.292
We cannot hope to destroy
a ship like that alone.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.792
With all due respect,
ambassador..

35:03.667 --> 35:06.000
...I've heard that before.

35:08.917 --> 35:11.167
Enemy vessel's closing.

35:13.583 --> 35:16.167
Captain, why didn't you want
the enemy to know

35:16.250 --> 35:18.542
we could make our own jump point
into hyperspace?

35:19.750 --> 35:21.708
'Cause most ships
this size can't do it.

35:21.792 --> 35:24.167
They have to rely
on a jumpgate.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.875
As long as it thinks
we're in that class

35:25.958 --> 35:29.125
we've got one extra weapon
in our arsenal.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.375
Tell me, commander.

35:31.458 --> 35:32.917
Have you ever wondered
what would happen

35:33.000 --> 35:35.500
if you opened a jump point
while inside a jumpgate?

35:35.583 --> 35:38.125
No, and neither should you.

35:38.208 --> 35:39.708
Earthforce experimented
with the idea

35:39.792 --> 35:41.333
during the Minbari War.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.833
They called it
the Bonehead Maneuver.

35:43.917 --> 35:45.917
- No offense.
- None taken.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.500
Because it's suicide.

35:47.583 --> 35:49.125
Forming a jump point
inside a jumpgate

35:49.208 --> 35:51.042
releases a staggering
amount of energy.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.708
None of our ships could
clear the blast range

35:52.792 --> 35:53.833
before being blown to bits.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.542
But this isn't one of our ships.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.417
Mr. Lennier, what do you think?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.333
Is this ship fast enough
to get out

35:59.417 --> 36:01.208
before the gate blows?

36:01.833 --> 36:03.500
I have no idea.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.292
Well, it'll do.

36:09.375 --> 36:13.167
We should just about be
to Sector 45 by now.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.542
Tell them to head to the
local jumpgate, best speed.

36:15.625 --> 36:18.583
Uh, captain, why this jumpgate?

36:18.667 --> 36:20.000
It's expendable.

36:21.333 --> 36:22.750
Used to be the Markab system.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.125
But since they died off,
other races have been using

36:25.208 --> 36:27.208
the abandoned gate
to strip the place bare.

36:27.292 --> 36:30.042
I do not like grave robbers.

36:30.125 --> 36:32.792
This should take care
of two problems at once.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.875
Approaching jumpgate.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.583
Alright. Stand by
jumpgate sequence.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.042
Ivanova, you ride
the jump engines.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.042
Be ready on my signal.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.958
You ready?

36:44.042 --> 36:46.792
No, but you may proceed anyway.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.042
Activate jumpgate sequence..

36:53.125 --> 36:54.167
...now.

36:56.625 --> 36:59.167
Half jump engines on line now.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.417
[engines revving]

37:06.250 --> 37:07.333
Punch it!

37:10.500 --> 37:13.542
[crackling]

37:20.500 --> 37:22.458
Hang on. Oh.

37:22.542 --> 37:24.000
[Ivanova yells]

37:26.583 --> 37:29.625
[rumbling]

37:36.250 --> 37:39.417
- Everybody alright?
- Yeah, fine, I-I think.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.333
Lennier. Lennier.

37:41.417 --> 37:43.000
Are you alright?

37:43.083 --> 37:44.750
I was just thinking

37:44.833 --> 37:48.208
that, uh,
in all my years in temple

37:48.292 --> 37:49.792
nothing ever prepared me

37:49.875 --> 37:52.750
for this sort of experience.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.958
Perhaps that
when this is all over

37:55.042 --> 37:59.958
that I will submit a proposal
to revise the program.

38:00.042 --> 38:02.375
I think that would be
a very good idea.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.375
[both sigh]

38:07.625 --> 38:09.708
[instrumental music]

38:16.125 --> 38:18.833
[indistinct chatter]

38:22.833 --> 38:24.958
Captain Sheridan.
Commander Ivanova.

38:25.042 --> 38:27.583
So good of you to join us.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.667
Could you please explain to me
where you have been

38:29.750 --> 38:32.375
what you have been doing and
why there is a fraudulent entry

38:32.458 --> 38:35.542
in the station logs
about your destination?

38:35.625 --> 38:38.083
Oh, I'd be happy to, Mr. Endawi.

38:38.167 --> 38:39.542
Uh, I'm sorry we left you

38:39.625 --> 38:41.000
in the lurch like this,
but we've been--

38:41.083 --> 38:43.375
Assisting my government
by towing a disabled

38:43.458 --> 38:45.875
Minbari shuttle
to a nearby jump point.

38:45.958 --> 38:48.792
Yes, it took quite a while.
We just got back.

38:48.875 --> 38:51.542
And why is there no mention
of this in the station logs?

38:51.625 --> 38:54.333
It seems straightforward enough.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.750
It was a diplomatic shuttle

38:55.833 --> 38:57.708
carrying important
government documents.

38:57.792 --> 39:00.125
Uh, we were asked,
as a courtesy

39:00.208 --> 39:01.583
to keep this confidential

39:01.667 --> 39:04.625
to avoid embarrassing
the Minbari government.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.333
Now that we've
taken care of that..

39:10.417 --> 39:13.000
...is there anything else
we can do for you, Mr. Endawi?

39:13.083 --> 39:16.125
No. As a matter of fact,
I was just leaving.

39:16.208 --> 39:18.167
I have everything I came for.

39:18.250 --> 39:20.792
I'll turn this over
to SID for analysis.

39:20.875 --> 39:22.583
See what they can make of it.

39:22.667 --> 39:25.708
I'll make sure you get a copy
of my report.

39:37.500 --> 39:41.250
(Endawi)
'You'll find the report
quite complete, senator.'

39:41.333 --> 39:42.708
And no one knows
what this ship is

39:42.792 --> 39:44.250
or where it came from.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.167
Not that I could determine.

39:46.250 --> 39:49.458
I came across some interesting
stories here and there.

39:49.542 --> 39:53.042
Most of it
from a thousand years ago.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.458
I don't know if it has
any relevance or not.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.458
Well, we'll leave that
for the experts to tell us.

39:58.542 --> 40:01.667
Good work on this, Endawi.
I'll let you know what we find.

40:05.792 --> 40:06.917
[sighs]

40:12.667 --> 40:15.667
I told you to wait outside.
You could've been seen.

40:15.750 --> 40:18.625
(Morden)
'No harm.
No one knows who I am.'

40:18.708 --> 40:20.833
(female #1)
'It's all here.
They don't have much to go on.'

40:20.917 --> 40:22.167
'A little from the Narns.'

40:22.250 --> 40:25.375
Yes, well,
that's to be expected.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.542
But I think we've neutralized
that problem.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.208
- Nothing else then?
- Not that I can see.

40:31.292 --> 40:33.750
The ship's a complete mystery
to all of them.

40:33.833 --> 40:37.792
Good. My associates will be
very happy to hear that.

40:37.875 --> 40:40.375
There's no need to rush things.

40:40.458 --> 40:43.292
Your government can dismiss this
as an isolated incident.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.667
I don't know.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.000
There's something about
this idea of a threat

40:47.083 --> 40:50.125
to planetary security
I find very appealing.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.708
As long as we keep
the real truth to ourselves

40:52.792 --> 40:55.250
there's no reason
we can't use this situation

40:55.333 --> 40:57.583
to speed up the program
here at home.

40:58.583 --> 41:00.667
Interesting.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.875
What exactly
did you have in mind?

41:11.542 --> 41:15.042
(Sheridan)
Although some of us,
like Susan here

41:15.125 --> 41:16.375
make it a point
to watch everything

41:16.458 --> 41:18.250
that happens on Babylon 5

41:18.333 --> 41:20.583
most of the rest
don't have that option.

41:21.708 --> 41:24.042
Now up until now

41:24.125 --> 41:25.833
Delenn and I and..

41:25.917 --> 41:28.542
...maybe Garibaldi here
have had all the pieces

41:28.625 --> 41:31.042
to what's going on out there.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.833
The return of The Shadows,
the rangers.

41:34.958 --> 41:37.333
The loss of my wife
on Zahadoom.

41:39.667 --> 41:41.125
The first thing I learned
at the academy

41:41.208 --> 41:45.167
was that a lack of information
can kill you.

41:47.625 --> 41:49.542
We can't afford that.

41:50.625 --> 41:52.958
So I'm creating a war council.

41:53.042 --> 41:55.208
We'll meet every two weeks
for now

41:55.292 --> 41:57.250
unless something urgent
comes up.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.667
'The war council will
consist of each of us'

41:59.750 --> 42:02.875
'whichever ranger is stationed
here at the time'

42:02.958 --> 42:06.875
'and a few others
I hope to add later.'

42:06.958 --> 42:09.375
'Now whatever knowledge
or information we have'

42:09.458 --> 42:11.250
will be shared among the rest.

42:11.333 --> 42:13.208
There are no ground rules.

42:13.292 --> 42:16.292
Anyone can say anything
he or she wants to say.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.208
Well, then I have a question.

42:20.292 --> 42:23.625
Granted, I'm stuck in Medlab
most of the time

42:23.708 --> 42:26.000
and granted,
I'm usually the last

42:26.083 --> 42:27.667
to know anything around here

42:27.750 --> 42:29.625
and granted, we've all been
pretty busy lately

42:29.708 --> 42:32.875
but could someone please tell me
what the hell these Shadows are?

42:36.750 --> 42:38.292
There are beings
in the universe

42:38.375 --> 42:42.292
billions of years older
than any of our races.

42:42.375 --> 42:44.792
They walked among the stars
like giants.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.208
Vast, timeless.

42:47.292 --> 42:49.375
They created great empires

42:49.458 --> 42:51.125
taught the new races

42:51.208 --> 42:53.792
explored beyond the Rim.

42:53.875 --> 42:57.833
The oldest of the ancients
are The Shadows.

42:57.917 --> 42:59.667
We have no other name for them.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.667
