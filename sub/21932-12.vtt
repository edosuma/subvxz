I hope I haven't pressed you into this.

00:48.651 --> 00:52.094
Don't be silly, William.
I'm happy to accompany you.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.938
- You really don't mind?
- Not at all.

00:54.995 --> 00:57.522
I just hope my morning
sickness passes quickly.

00:57.819 --> 00:59.492
Don't worry, William.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.771
It's worth it for a healthy baby.

01:03.758 --> 01:07.310
- Well, here we are.
- Yes. Here we are.

01:07.621 --> 01:10.030
(BELL TOLLING)

01:11.046 --> 01:12.332
Shall we?

01:12.366 --> 01:14.243
This'll do me good.

01:14.368 --> 01:17.461
I'm in need of some quiet contemplation.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.110
Or a nap.

01:21.476 --> 01:24.288
(GIGGLING)

01:27.448 --> 01:29.416
There's a visiting bishop today.

01:29.677 --> 01:32.412
He's giving a sermon on confessions.

01:33.126 --> 01:36.256
Perhaps you could glean some
advice for the interview room.

01:36.436 --> 01:38.258
Are you saying I need it?

01:38.292 --> 01:40.380
"I will instruct thee and teach thee

01:40.414 --> 01:42.286
in the way which thou shalt go."

01:42.660 --> 01:44.180
<i>Psalms.</i>

01:45.130 --> 01:47.369
I'm not a complete heathen, William.

01:47.494 --> 01:49.108
I have read the Bible.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.445
Good morning.

01:52.101 --> 01:55.002
I shall depart from
tradition this morning

01:55.127 --> 01:57.844
by sharing with you all some good news.

01:58.232 --> 02:01.782
Yesterday, the church
received a surprise,

02:01.907 --> 02:05.302
the gift of a statue of the Virgin Mary,

02:05.320 --> 02:07.354
from an anonymous donor.

02:07.765 --> 02:10.770
I think we can all agree
that this is a most fitting

02:10.834 --> 02:12.814
addition to the church.

02:13.355 --> 02:16.401
And now, with Father
McGray's kind permission,

02:16.526 --> 02:19.089
I will deliver the Lord's message.

02:19.896 --> 02:23.016
Every one of us sins.

02:23.337 --> 02:26.173
We may be made in the image of the Lord,

02:26.207 --> 02:29.743
but we are all of us
imperfect creations.

02:29.777 --> 02:33.753
We acknowledge our imperfections
by admitting to our sins.

02:33.878 --> 02:35.782
This is the purpose

02:35.817 --> 02:37.588
and the power of confession.

02:37.904 --> 02:41.502
It is not to admit to the
Lord that we have done wrong.

02:41.715 --> 02:44.500
It is to admit to Him that we are aware

02:44.519 --> 02:47.725
of our weakness and of our wickedness.

02:47.759 --> 02:49.555
- (MURMURS)
- What's going on?

02:49.929 --> 02:51.599
I don't know.

02:51.829 --> 02:56.475
- (MURMURS)
- I should also suggest to you that we...

02:56.941 --> 02:59.337
Virgin Mary, pray for us!

02:59.406 --> 03:01.241
(EXCLAMATIONS)

03:02.278 --> 03:03.758
The statue!

03:04.167 --> 03:05.640
It's crying!

03:05.663 --> 03:07.523
It's not crying.

03:07.581 --> 03:09.337
That's blood.

03:17.910 --> 03:20.650
- Father McGray, it's good to see you.
- Ah.

03:20.673 --> 03:22.578
Detective Murdoch and Dr. Ogden.

03:22.625 --> 03:25.774
- We don't see you often enough.
- Father, I would appreciate a word.

03:25.791 --> 03:28.552
I'm afraid I don't know what to
say. You've seen as much as I have.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.942
Yes. This statue arrived yesterday?

03:30.961 --> 03:34.668
It was delivered right before
sunrise, and there was no note.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.271
An anonymous benefactor. Curious.

03:37.294 --> 03:40.356
It's not unheard of to
receive gifts in that manner.

03:40.983 --> 03:43.704
Father, I would like
to examine this statue.

03:43.829 --> 03:46.901
Truth be told, Detective, I
would like to examine it as well.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.964
Are you reluctant to
believe in miracles, Father?

03:50.024 --> 03:51.669
Officially, no.

03:51.738 --> 03:55.487
Scepticism in these cases is equated
with doubting our entire faith.

03:55.612 --> 03:57.969
- However, it's...
- I believe blind faith

03:58.009 --> 04:00.885
without sceptical inquiry is ignorance.

04:01.051 --> 04:02.616
I'll admit I agree.

04:02.953 --> 04:05.034
Will you allow me to investigate?

04:06.922 --> 04:07.978
Bishop.

04:08.003 --> 04:11.304
Bishop, I'm Detective William
Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

04:11.350 --> 04:14.258
- I was just telling Father McGray...
- Let me guess.

04:14.383 --> 04:16.728
You were telling him that you, a layman,

04:16.767 --> 04:19.187
would like to investigate this miracle.

04:19.779 --> 04:21.069
Correct.

04:21.322 --> 04:24.252
Detective, the Catholic
Church has many cardinals

04:24.264 --> 04:26.503
whose job it is to
rule on these matters.

04:26.521 --> 04:30.240
I intend to leave it in
their most capable hands.

04:30.314 --> 04:33.348
- What are you afraid of?
- Sorry, I beg your pardon?

04:35.385 --> 04:37.712
Well, surely if it's a real miracle

04:37.936 --> 04:40.766
it would withstand examination.

04:40.977 --> 04:44.040
What occurred here today is
not of the concrete world,

04:44.051 --> 04:45.525
but of the spiritual one,

04:45.778 --> 04:48.219
as any good Catholic would understand.

04:48.582 --> 04:49.820
Good day.

04:52.998 --> 04:55.041
It seems I've been outranked.

05:07.667 --> 05:08.865
I can't do it.

05:09.458 --> 05:12.964
- What's that?
- The bread. I can't do it. It's...

05:13.089 --> 05:15.123
it's soft, it's tasteless...

05:15.169 --> 05:17.754
Let me guess. The food
was better in Paris?

05:17.879 --> 05:19.280
You're right about that, Higgins.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.928
Let me tell you, every meal was a feast!

05:21.974 --> 05:25.647
Even bread... a long,
crisp French baguette?

05:25.687 --> 05:28.376
- Oh, work of art.
- You don't say.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.559
- Ruth!
- Henry!

05:31.684 --> 05:34.968
- George. I hope you don't mind this intrusion.
- Not at all.

05:35.025 --> 05:37.512
I bought you a present that I
couldn't wait to give it to you.

05:37.536 --> 05:39.223
Let's see it!

05:40.202 --> 05:41.975
It's a hat.

05:42.366 --> 05:44.150
You shouldn't have!

05:45.210 --> 05:46.789
Oh! See?

05:46.823 --> 05:48.946
I knew you would look dashing in that.

05:50.886 --> 05:52.429
What do you think, George?

05:53.051 --> 05:55.331
Oh yes, that's... fine for over here.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.410
Fine for over here?

05:57.450 --> 05:59.597
George only likes French things now.

05:59.609 --> 06:04.499
If my trip has broadened my
worldview, then <i>excusez-moi.</i>

06:06.411 --> 06:09.178
I should be going,
but I'll see you soon.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.890
And, Henry,

06:10.936 --> 06:13.729
that hat really does look nice on you.

06:13.752 --> 06:16.060
Thank you, Floopsie. Rawr!

06:20.095 --> 06:22.224
That Miss Newsome is
really something, huh?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.304
She is indeed.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.862
You know, Higgins, far be
it from me to give advice,

06:26.885 --> 06:29.632
- but if I were you...
- I'm gonna ask her for her hand, George.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.810
What?

06:31.214 --> 06:33.410
Higgins, you've only been
courting her a short while.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.797
I've worn the same pair of socks longer.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.761
I've got a ring already.

06:38.170 --> 06:41.677
I can't imagine that there's a
better woman than Ruth Newsome.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.047
For you, perhaps.

06:45.904 --> 06:47.071
Well,

06:47.893 --> 06:50.468
it's really all that matters
now, isn't it, George?

06:51.312 --> 06:54.369
I can't believe the <i>Telegraph has
stooped to reporting false news!</i>

06:54.494 --> 06:57.387
False news? Sir, this
is a real live miracle!

06:57.472 --> 06:59.860
As far as I'm concerned, it's
about time Toronto caught up

06:59.878 --> 07:02.287
- with the rest of the world and had one.
- Incredible.

07:02.324 --> 07:04.915
- Will you go back to see it again?
- I believe I will.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.669
You know, I narrowly missed

07:06.680 --> 07:09.203
the relic of St. Rose
while I was in "Paree".

07:09.229 --> 07:11.005
Apparently, if you touched it

07:11.031 --> 07:12.818
and made a wish, it would come true.

07:12.851 --> 07:15.637
Somebody from this church
made a wish and it came true.

07:15.677 --> 07:17.398
I bet they're making piles of money.

07:17.581 --> 07:19.645
Miracles <i>are</i> a part of the faith.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.357
It's probably rusty water
from a leak in the ceiling.

07:22.438 --> 07:24.803
- The ceiling is sound.
- Condensation.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.576
Unless the statue is metal...

07:26.657 --> 07:29.802
- Alabaster.
- Alabaster doesn't produce condensation.

07:29.843 --> 07:31.154
It's a load of bollocks.

07:31.394 --> 07:33.239
Surely you don't believe
this parlour trick.

07:33.295 --> 07:34.880
You're a man of science.

07:35.396 --> 07:38.810
- It does warrant a closer look.
- Uh, Detective,

07:38.840 --> 07:41.303
would you be opposed to me joining you?

07:43.306 --> 07:46.142
(HUBBUB)

07:56.253 --> 07:59.396
- Gentlemen, what's your business here?
- We're protesting.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.864
We hope you're here to
shut this circus down.

08:02.027 --> 08:03.058
I'll decide that.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.030
These Catholics are always
dramatic, but now this?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.865
A fake miracle? It's an insult.

08:08.354 --> 08:09.933
Bloody papists!

08:11.524 --> 08:13.818
Unless you intend to spend
the night in the cells,

08:13.823 --> 08:16.754
I'd suggest you disperse. Now.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.272
Excuse me.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.298
Detective Murdoch, Detective
Watts, Toronto Constabulary.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.869
- Pleased to make your acquaintance, Father... ?
- Jennings.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.689
Welcome. What can I do for you?

08:46.759 --> 08:49.305
We'd like to take a sample
of the blood for testing.

08:49.766 --> 08:51.649
I'm afraid I'm new to this church.

08:51.671 --> 08:53.388
I can't make that decision myself.

08:53.705 --> 08:56.941
Bishop Gorey has decried that
no one is to touch the statue.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.736
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

08:58.761 --> 09:02.107
Please, do not get too
close to the Virgin.

09:03.039 --> 09:04.767
Please, back away.

09:06.705 --> 09:09.642
Well, now might be the
time to take a sample.

09:09.659 --> 09:12.561
I'm afraid I have to
respect the Bishop's wishes.

09:12.596 --> 09:14.933
- And I understand that.
- Wha...

09:24.929 --> 09:26.056
You...

09:26.443 --> 09:28.210
- what are you doing?
- I'm just...

09:28.391 --> 09:30.390
paying my respects.

09:37.353 --> 09:39.555
- (CLINKING SOUND)
- Julia.

09:39.919 --> 09:41.277
Hello.

09:41.402 --> 09:43.115
Another stomach upset.

09:43.327 --> 09:45.805
- Perhaps you should...
- See a doctor?

09:45.828 --> 09:49.917
- Don't worry, I...
- Unsettled stomachs can be a harbinger, Dr. Ogden.

09:49.955 --> 09:52.216
Typhus, cholera, Russian flu...

09:52.244 --> 09:54.064
I'm fine, Detective.

09:56.606 --> 09:59.444
- Have you something for me?
- Yes. Blood.

09:59.526 --> 10:02.598
- Oh. From where?
- The Virgin Mary.

10:03.225 --> 10:05.381
So the church is cooperating now?

10:05.415 --> 10:07.716
The order to stay away
from the statue stands.

10:07.751 --> 10:09.463
Detective Murdoch is cooperating.

10:09.481 --> 10:11.959
- I am not.
- (HEAVING)

10:12.722 --> 10:15.109
Ugh! Miss Hart?

10:15.579 --> 10:17.947
The Detective has a blood sample.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.663
- Could you put it on a slide, please?
- Certainly.

10:20.862 --> 10:23.777
May I ask... is there
a small part of you

10:23.801 --> 10:25.666
that believes it might be a miracle?

10:26.036 --> 10:28.738
I prefer logic and science to faith.

10:28.772 --> 10:31.501
And if logic and science
can offer no explanation?

10:31.547 --> 10:33.012
Consider the bumblebee...

10:33.044 --> 10:35.208
it shouldn't be able
to fly, and yet it does.

10:35.213 --> 10:38.534
Well, I believe science will
explain that in time, too.

10:38.548 --> 10:41.706
Then you've simply chosen
to put your faith in science

10:41.739 --> 10:43.452
rather than religion.

10:43.954 --> 10:46.035
Well, miracle or not,

10:46.072 --> 10:48.591
this blood is definitely mammalian.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.382
I will need some time to
ascertain if it's human.

10:52.613 --> 10:54.492
Of course. Thank you, ladies.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.776
- Uh...
- We should go.

11:03.773 --> 11:07.449
If it is animal blood, perhaps
this is someone's idea of a joke.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.951
Yes, and if it's human,

11:09.988 --> 11:11.899
perhaps something rather darker.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.635
- Hello, I'm Detective...
- Have you seen the Virgin?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.680
- Yes, I have.
- She's crying for me.

11:25.864 --> 11:28.213
Do you think her tears smell like roses?

11:28.236 --> 11:30.295
- I can't say I've noticed the...
- Ah!

11:31.659 --> 11:32.695
Father?

11:32.704 --> 11:34.837
My housekeeper, Miss
Beattie, is overwrought,

11:35.016 --> 11:36.784
as are many in the congregation.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.074
I am striving to guide
her as best as I can.

11:41.961 --> 11:44.605
- This is madness.
- I have a confession to make.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.883
- Now?
- Detective Watts took a sample of the blood.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.451
I should be furious, but I'm
not. I just want this to end.

11:50.488 --> 11:52.431
- What did you find?
- It's human.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.738
- Human? How?
- (SOBBING): I'm a sinner.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.465
Forgive me.

11:58.908 --> 12:01.400
I'm a murderer!

12:09.690 --> 12:12.389
Perhaps, this isn't the best time.

12:12.514 --> 12:16.027
I understand that she is
distressed. I'll be brief.

12:16.888 --> 12:19.325
But she has made a serious claim.

12:20.854 --> 12:24.170
Father, I wish to speak
with Miss Beattie alone.

12:24.295 --> 12:26.334
I think she would rather that I stayed.

12:26.366 --> 12:27.573
This won't take long.

12:27.601 --> 12:30.912
If you'd prefer, I could ask that
she come down to the station house.

12:31.294 --> 12:32.737
That won't be necessary.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.103
It's all right, Father.

12:35.665 --> 12:37.914
I'm prepared to talk to the Detective.

12:45.086 --> 12:47.075
How are you feeling, Miss Beattie?

12:51.047 --> 12:52.235
You...

12:52.360 --> 12:55.025
stated that you are a murderer.

12:56.172 --> 12:58.134
Please tell me what you meant.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.594
I...

13:00.179 --> 13:02.157
I haven't been sleeping very well.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.036
I can't get any peace.

13:05.904 --> 13:08.203
Perhaps it will help
to speak with someone.

13:09.129 --> 13:10.838
It happened...

13:11.644 --> 13:13.735
when I was 18 years old.

13:14.122 --> 13:15.765
My mother was ill.

13:16.437 --> 13:18.855
I looked after her as best I could,

13:19.251 --> 13:20.812
but I was young.

13:21.563 --> 13:24.689
I went out to a dance,
and when I got home...

13:25.026 --> 13:26.840
She had passed away.

13:27.135 --> 13:28.922
She needed her pills

13:29.212 --> 13:31.201
and I wasn't there to give them to her.

13:32.265 --> 13:35.056
Now the Virgin Mary is speaking to me.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.294
She knows I'm guilty.

13:37.621 --> 13:39.604
The statue is speaking to you?

13:39.615 --> 13:42.677
God is speaking to me through her.

13:44.695 --> 13:48.357
Miss Beattie, I am very
sorry about your mother,

13:49.038 --> 13:51.215
but in the eyes of the law,

13:51.246 --> 13:53.279
that doesn't make you a murderer.

13:53.325 --> 13:57.320
Just because a person doesn't
shoot or stab or smother

13:57.354 --> 14:01.005
doesn't mean that they aren't
equally guilty of murder.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.661
(OMINOUS MUSIC)

14:18.283 --> 14:21.811
- <i>Bonjour, mon amour!</i>
- Ahh!

14:22.589 --> 14:25.683
You two do realise
you're still Canadians?

14:25.721 --> 14:28.185
Travel can change a
person, Constable Higgins.

14:28.220 --> 14:30.755
- Often for the better.
- I'm not interested.

14:30.792 --> 14:33.115
You should try a trip to "Paree", Henry.

14:33.149 --> 14:35.383
In fact, it would be an
excellent place for a honeymoon.

14:35.418 --> 14:37.544
There's nothing wrong
with Niagara Falls.

14:37.558 --> 14:40.916
Why would anyone want to get
married? It's terribly passé.

14:40.944 --> 14:43.449
- Well now, there is something to be said...
- Oh, George,

14:43.467 --> 14:46.361
do you remember that handsome couple
we met on the Champs-Élysées?

14:46.395 --> 14:49.833
They'd been together for years and
never married. They were very...

14:49.958 --> 14:51.566
<i>au courant.</i>

14:51.970 --> 14:54.710
- Did they live together?
- When it suited them.

14:54.747 --> 14:56.451
It sounded marvellous.

14:56.492 --> 14:58.902
I'll never get married.
I would just die.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.584
Wouldn't you just die, George?

15:00.610 --> 15:02.769
Actually, Nina, Henry's just told me

15:02.791 --> 15:05.226
that he plans to propose to Ruth.

15:07.294 --> 15:08.416
Ohh!

15:09.339 --> 15:10.933
That's wonderful!

15:12.079 --> 15:13.555
Do you have a ring?

15:14.295 --> 15:15.598
Yes.

15:18.381 --> 15:19.818
It's simple.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.798
But it's lovely.

15:22.832 --> 15:24.263
It's all I could afford.

15:24.388 --> 15:28.620
Well, simple is... is
modern. Simple's all the rage.

15:39.936 --> 15:41.904
Interesting, isn't it?

15:41.927 --> 15:45.587
Some would think that the
photographic process was a miracle.

15:47.924 --> 15:50.134
And, like most phenomena,

15:50.152 --> 15:53.979
this miracle is the result
of a natural process.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.131
Most phenomena, you say?

15:56.165 --> 15:58.814
So that which confound
scientific understanding

15:58.823 --> 16:00.785
must then be the divine?

16:01.596 --> 16:02.683
Hm.

16:03.701 --> 16:09.520
Perhaps science itself is
a creation of the divine.

16:09.592 --> 16:12.204
Well, then you do believe in miracles.

16:13.323 --> 16:14.783
Bloody left-footers.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.762
First they want us gone, next they
want us at their beck and call.

16:17.782 --> 16:21.831
- I beg your pardon?
-  Left-footers. Catholics, Watts. Catholics.

16:22.144 --> 16:25.649
The Constabulary has been asked
to supply round-the-clock guards

16:25.838 --> 16:27.028
for their miracle.

16:27.063 --> 16:30.384
- Have there been disturbances?
- Well, take a pick, Murdoch.

16:30.509 --> 16:34.394
Not only has some mystery man
stolen the Virgin Mary's tears,

16:34.584 --> 16:37.531
but someone has tried to
smash the statue with a hammer.

16:38.107 --> 16:40.353
Add to that every Catholic
this side of Manitoba

16:40.376 --> 16:42.421
is making a pilgrimage to the church.

16:42.945 --> 16:44.843
Send Crabtree and Higgins down there,

16:45.244 --> 16:48.100
see if they can hold
back the Fenian hordes.

16:48.468 --> 16:50.002
Yes, sir.

16:55.132 --> 16:58.260
Eating dinner packed by your
lady love's own personal chef...

16:58.294 --> 17:00.235
doesn't get much better
than that, George.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.013
I would hardly call
crab paste sandwiches

17:03.040 --> 17:05.103
the height of a romantic
relationship, Henry,

17:05.135 --> 17:08.488
especially when it's prepared
by your lady love's servant.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.229
She is awfully grand, isn't she?

17:12.463 --> 17:14.655
Sometimes I wonder if
I'm good enough for her.

17:15.084 --> 17:16.878
You're plenty good enough, Henry.

17:17.099 --> 17:19.467
I think the two of you
are a perfect match.

17:20.194 --> 17:22.349
Maybe she deserves
better than a constable.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.519
Earning a constable's wages.

17:24.553 --> 17:27.278
Don't be daft, Higgins, she
doesn't care about your money.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.500
She's got enough for both
of you. I'm telling you,

17:29.520 --> 17:31.159
if you marry this woman,

17:31.215 --> 17:33.504
you may never have to
work another day again.

17:33.629 --> 17:35.862
I'll work. I'm no cad.

17:37.428 --> 17:40.068
Perhaps I won't work
quite as hard, though.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.900
Now that I find hard to believe.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.290
Sir, what are you doing here?

17:46.313 --> 17:48.736
Taking advantage of the privacy.

17:48.805 --> 17:51.880
Sir, you're not... you're not
supposed to touch the statue.

17:51.914 --> 17:53.558
I don't intend to, George.

17:53.683 --> 17:55.405
What is this?

17:55.530 --> 17:59.430
I've modified this Crookes tube
to make a portable Roentgen ray.

17:59.555 --> 18:02.512
Shining the resulting rays
through the statue's head

18:02.525 --> 18:05.393
should give me an image of
what, if anything, is inside.

18:06.348 --> 18:08.172
You should try it on Higgins, sir.

18:08.384 --> 18:09.963
You're trespassing.

18:11.769 --> 18:13.330
We were asked here.

18:13.685 --> 18:15.389
To guard the statue.

18:15.472 --> 18:19.717
Father, with all due respect, we
need to know if this miracle is real.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.101
So you wish to use this
Roentgen ray machine

18:24.113 --> 18:26.284
to take an image of the interior?

18:26.943 --> 18:29.494
Father, you're familiar
with Roentgen rays?

18:31.055 --> 18:33.358
I visit the Dundas Library regularly.

18:34.123 --> 18:37.025
The scientific journals are all abuzz

18:37.071 --> 18:39.537
regarding these new X-rays.

18:39.662 --> 18:41.216
So you approve?

18:41.607 --> 18:44.475
Let me just say that I'm
having difficulty believing

18:44.508 --> 18:46.254
that the Virgin's tears are...

18:46.691 --> 18:47.999
divine.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.604
Detective Watts.

18:56.729 --> 19:01.049
I've just read a 20-year-old
obituary for one Flora Beattie.

19:01.081 --> 19:03.235
Died of a heart attack
after a long illness.

19:03.236 --> 19:05.244
Survived by her daughter Josephine.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.511
Proof of her confession.

19:08.022 --> 19:11.052
So that particular
confession may be true, but...

19:11.268 --> 19:13.300
You believe there's something more?

19:14.152 --> 19:15.663
Quite possibly.

19:15.916 --> 19:17.367
Have a look at this.

19:19.790 --> 19:23.231
I've found two small
holes, one in each eye.

19:23.356 --> 19:25.714
I believe the fluid was
inserted with a syringe,

19:25.737 --> 19:27.475
collected in this reservoir;

19:27.510 --> 19:30.080
the plaster in each eye
then allows the fluid

19:30.084 --> 19:32.866
to seep out slowly, thus
making the statue cry.

19:32.898 --> 19:35.929
Hm. Have you alerted the church?

19:36.306 --> 19:39.563
Father McGray assures me
of his utmost discretion.

19:40.290 --> 19:43.428
Our only hope of discovering
who created this statue

19:43.460 --> 19:46.327
is to wait for another
miracle to be attempted.

19:46.362 --> 19:47.904
You want her to cry again.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.755
Yes.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.694
But before that can happen,
I need you to find out

19:52.712 --> 19:55.170
where a statue of this
quality might be made.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.875
Take one of these photographs with you.

19:59.478 --> 20:03.645
So you've definitely proven that
the Virgin Mary isn't crying.

20:04.272 --> 20:06.465
You don't seem pleased, Detective Watts.

20:06.639 --> 20:12.120
No. I'll admit I found it
heartening to contemplate a miracle,

20:12.154 --> 20:14.756
if only for a passing moment.

20:25.119 --> 20:26.806
We haven't seen a soul in hours.

20:26.836 --> 20:28.903
I don't see why the both
of us have to be here.

20:28.938 --> 20:32.148
- For the company.
- Yes, I know, but...

20:32.843 --> 20:34.484
perhaps one of us could take a break.

20:34.543 --> 20:38.095
- I'll go first.
- Well, the Inspector did charge both of us

20:38.114 --> 20:39.735
with looking after the statue.

20:39.860 --> 20:41.678
- (FOOTSTEPS)
- Who's that?

20:41.715 --> 20:44.663
- Henry, I...
- I thought you were gonna wait outside.

20:45.883 --> 20:48.021
If you two wanted to be alone,
you could've just told me.

20:48.045 --> 20:49.441
No, we were just...

20:49.456 --> 20:52.212
No, I mean, this brings me back
to my earlier point about Toronto.

20:52.264 --> 20:54.305
It's a wonderful city, but it's too...

20:55.388 --> 20:58.969
- inhibited. If we were in France...
- Should we go for a walk, Henry?

20:59.034 --> 21:00.255
Yes.

21:02.204 --> 21:04.139
(SIGHING)

21:08.030 --> 21:09.842
- (SHRILL SOUND)
- What was that?

21:10.027 --> 21:13.269
- It was a bird.
- There's no birds at night, Henry.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.409
- What about owls?
- That was not a bird.

21:15.424 --> 21:18.144
Though I suppose anything's better
than George Crabtree prattling on.

21:18.187 --> 21:20.346
- George?
- I know you work with him, Henry, but...

21:20.376 --> 21:23.458
Well, I don't just work
with him. He's my friend.

21:23.618 --> 21:26.098
He's my best friend. In fact,

21:26.905 --> 21:29.193
- if ever I were to marry...
- It would be to George?

21:29.932 --> 21:32.439
- No, he would be my best man.
- Oh, well,

21:32.516 --> 21:35.409
- I suppose he is reliable.
- (CLANKING, GASPING)

21:36.532 --> 21:38.408
It's all right, Ruth.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.608
You're safe with me.

21:41.356 --> 21:42.951
In fact,

21:44.217 --> 21:47.391
- I intend to keep you safe all your life.
- Oh...

21:47.866 --> 21:50.185
Ruth Alfreda Newsome,

21:50.219 --> 21:52.153
of the Mimico Newsomes...

21:52.188 --> 21:54.206
- Oh, are you all right?
- I...

21:54.331 --> 21:56.391
(SCREAMING)

22:14.314 --> 22:17.078
Higgins saw her come
sailing off the bell tower.

22:17.539 --> 22:19.841
That would account for
these injuries, wouldn't it?

22:20.204 --> 22:22.587
Let's not be too quick to judge.

22:22.610 --> 22:25.547
- This wound is unusual.
- How so?

22:25.816 --> 22:30.209
- By the looks of it, she was struck with something.
- Well, yes. The ground.

22:31.211 --> 22:33.905
Yes, I don't think so.

22:34.157 --> 22:35.885
Curious.

22:37.193 --> 22:39.247
There are fresh scratches on both arms.

22:40.094 --> 22:42.978
So where was she before
the bell tolled for her?

22:44.710 --> 22:46.333
Never seen it before.

22:46.558 --> 22:49.362
Are you sure? Have another look.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.148
I know the statues I've
carved. That's not one of them.

22:52.522 --> 22:55.597
Well, your friend over
there told me differently.

22:55.660 --> 22:57.836
Well, there's nothing more to say.

23:00.899 --> 23:03.726
The head of this statue
is filled with human blood

23:03.761 --> 23:06.116
from an unknown person,
and therefore falls

23:06.122 --> 23:08.010
in the purview of the Constabulary.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.663
- Blood?
- Don't you read the papers?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.356
It's wreaking havoc in Toronto.

23:12.402 --> 23:14.406
Well, that has nothing to do with me.

23:14.452 --> 23:17.411
Oh... unfortunate, isn't it?

23:17.536 --> 23:20.450
That you're withholding evidence.

23:20.575 --> 23:24.152
- I'll have to shut this place down today.
- Hey, you can't do that.

23:24.175 --> 23:27.585
And take you into the station house
for questioning, unless someone

23:27.630 --> 23:30.250
can tell me who
commissioned that statue.

23:30.746 --> 23:34.795
Look, he paid me extra not
to talk to anyone about it.

23:35.651 --> 23:37.196
What was his name?

23:37.886 --> 23:40.430
- I have it written down on the bill.
- Hm.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.276
You didn't have to
accompany me to the top, sir.

23:47.299 --> 23:49.844
More than able, Murdoch. Besides,

23:49.913 --> 23:51.842
four eyes are better than two.

23:55.215 --> 23:57.057
Foot the ladder, Murdoch.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.263
This must be where she jumped from.

24:03.510 --> 24:06.009
It's a long bloody way down, Murdoch.

24:07.327 --> 24:08.691
Well.

24:09.671 --> 24:11.035
A note.

24:11.518 --> 24:14.909
"I cannot live with myself or
this terrible secret any longer.

24:15.168 --> 24:18.104
I must either confess or end my life."

24:18.229 --> 24:20.867
Sounds like a suicide note to me.

24:21.063 --> 24:23.107
That doesn't make any sense.

24:25.105 --> 24:26.878
Miss Beattie did confess.

24:27.172 --> 24:29.147
To myself and to Father McGray.

24:29.272 --> 24:32.014
Confession doesn't necessarily
make the guilt go away.

24:36.119 --> 24:37.322
Blood.

24:37.495 --> 24:40.515
I believe this is where she
sustained the injury to her forehead.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.603
You think somebody maybe
pushed her into the bell,

24:43.643 --> 24:45.336
then threw her off the tower?

24:54.530 --> 24:56.073
Roses.

24:57.219 --> 25:01.358
Sir, does it look to you like
the dirt around these rosebushes

25:01.381 --> 25:02.878
has been recently disturbed?

25:03.003 --> 25:05.152
I can't see. I can't really tell.

25:12.914 --> 25:14.284
Maybe.

25:15.096 --> 25:18.205
Do you recall the scratches
on Miss Beattie's arms?

25:23.547 --> 25:26.242
Let's hope whatever was there still is.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.620
- Age before beauty, sir.

Murdoch never digs. Never bloody digs.

25:42.267 --> 25:44.070
Never digs.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.341
It's always me or Crabtree digging.

25:56.345 --> 25:58.297
Perhaps a bit to the left.

26:06.702 --> 26:08.435
There's something.

26:22.225 --> 26:23.341
Poor little sod.

26:27.089 --> 26:29.605
Judging by the size of the remains

26:30.003 --> 26:33.687
and the fact that the posterior
fontanel had not yet closed,

26:34.619 --> 26:37.147
I'd say this child was a newborn.

26:37.452 --> 26:40.929
But why bury it under a bush,
with the church cemetery so close?

26:41.406 --> 26:44.918
Perhaps someone wanted to
pretend this child never existed.

26:46.455 --> 26:48.430
We'll find out everything we can.

26:54.439 --> 26:57.963
This might be difficult. How
are you feeling, Miss Hart?

26:58.026 --> 26:59.691
Oh, I'm fine.

27:01.199 --> 27:03.111
In our work so far,

27:03.347 --> 27:06.162
we haven't had occasion
to examine an infant.

27:06.951 --> 27:10.295
Well, that is true, but there's
no point crying or carrying on.

27:10.318 --> 27:13.689
Terrible things happen all the time.
I just try not to think about it.

27:14.029 --> 27:16.549
That's an admirable trait.

27:16.931 --> 27:18.184
You think so?

27:26.726 --> 27:29.181
Not only has she gone
back to Mimico, but

27:29.213 --> 27:32.281
she's taken to her bed, saying
that she has the vapours.

27:32.304 --> 27:34.552
Oh, dear. Have you gone to visit her?

27:34.598 --> 27:36.979
She wrote in her letter
that I shouldn't think of it.

27:37.269 --> 27:39.226
She doesn't want to see you anymore?

27:40.069 --> 27:41.262
I'm not sure.

27:41.289 --> 27:44.048
I think that every time she
looks at me now, she sees...

27:44.113 --> 27:46.724
She sees the dead body
landing at your feet.

27:46.789 --> 27:48.590
It must've been horrible.

27:49.654 --> 27:52.002
I thought a moonlit
stroll would be romantic.

27:52.058 --> 27:54.490
Go and see her, Henry.
Bring her flowers.

27:55.102 --> 27:58.142
She knew that I was just about to
propose. I was down on one knee.

27:58.202 --> 28:01.984
Well, "Cest" la vie, Henry.
Women are often fickle creatures.

28:02.721 --> 28:05.575
- Perhaps she just was...
- Nina, you didn't read the letter, now.

28:05.598 --> 28:08.396
Let's not torture poor Henry.

28:09.030 --> 28:10.405
George...

28:11.223 --> 28:12.754
just take this for me.

28:12.806 --> 28:14.464
I won't be needing it.

28:14.896 --> 28:16.347
Higgins!

28:16.472 --> 28:18.736
I'll try to sell it for you!

28:19.813 --> 28:21.960
So, also a possibility.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.012
- My suspicion was correct.
- Don't you ever knock?

28:25.081 --> 28:26.768
(KNOCKING)

28:27.124 --> 28:30.377
- What have you, Detective?
- A sculptor there did make the statue.

28:30.429 --> 28:34.119
- And?
- I know who ordered and paid for it.

28:46.597 --> 28:49.966
(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC)

29:06.090 --> 29:08.525
You are coming with us, Father.

29:14.978 --> 29:16.751
Father Jennings?

29:16.876 --> 29:18.761
How extraordinary.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.833
Why did he do it?

29:21.254 --> 29:23.320
I'm about to interview him.

29:23.908 --> 29:27.155
Did he have anything to do with
that poor infant you found buried?

29:27.892 --> 29:32.050
I believe the statue and the
baby are connected somehow, but...

29:33.107 --> 29:35.043
During your post-mortem,

29:35.072 --> 29:38.987
did you happen to determine if
she had ever carried a child?

29:39.260 --> 29:41.801
No, I was just looking
for cause of death.

29:41.815 --> 29:44.362
- I'll re-examine her right away.
- Thank you.

29:50.810 --> 29:52.523
William,

29:52.648 --> 29:56.150
something strange happened and I
can't seem to get it out of my mind.

29:56.215 --> 29:57.983
What is it?

29:58.035 --> 30:00.660
Did it seem odd to you
that Miss Hart was...

30:00.844 --> 30:03.532
completely unmoved earlier?

30:04.661 --> 30:07.095
- She's new at the profession.
- Precisely!

30:07.959 --> 30:11.753
How has she learned so quickly
to divorce herself from emotion?

30:11.878 --> 30:14.412
It would seem to me that those qualities

30:14.430 --> 30:16.613
would make her an excellent clinician.

30:17.590 --> 30:20.834
But even an expert can have
sympathy for the patient.

30:21.232 --> 30:22.677
Of course.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.772
You're probably right.

30:26.701 --> 30:30.138
She has taken to the
morgue exceptionally well.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.848
All right, Father, you
can start by telling us why

30:38.871 --> 30:41.259
- you commissioned this statue.
- I have nothing to do with it.

30:41.283 --> 30:43.125
We spoke with the sculptor who made it.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.188
- He gave us your name.
- I had his word.

30:46.205 --> 30:48.077
In the real world, Father,

30:48.135 --> 30:51.002
a man's word very
rarely accounts for much.

30:51.127 --> 30:53.138
What were your intentions?

30:53.967 --> 30:56.114
I most certainly didn't
mean for Miss Beattie

30:56.132 --> 30:58.078
- to take her own life.
- She didn't.

30:58.203 --> 30:59.868
We believe she was murdered.

31:00.346 --> 31:02.004
Perhaps you were the one who pushed her.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.036
No, I didn't, I swear!

31:04.348 --> 31:05.758
Father Jennings,

31:05.948 --> 31:10.445
help us understand why you
created this false miracle.

31:10.570 --> 31:15.166
- I... I can't say anything.
- Why not?

31:16.274 --> 31:19.309
All I can say is that I
wanted to root out evil.

31:19.342 --> 31:22.169
I thought that this miracle might
make those who committed evil

31:22.183 --> 31:24.403
confess to the police.

31:25.743 --> 31:27.820
What does this have to
do with Miss Beattie?

31:28.345 --> 31:29.426
I...

31:29.538 --> 31:32.228
- Did she discover that you had the statue made?
- No.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.276
We found an infant's body
buried in the rectory gardens.

31:36.976 --> 31:39.883
- Was it Miss Beattie's child?
- I cannot say!

31:39.906 --> 31:41.711
Can't say or won't say?

31:42.660 --> 31:45.561
Right, that's it. We're arresting
you on the suspicion of murder.

31:45.598 --> 31:47.047
You can sit in a cell till you decide...

31:47.071 --> 31:50.399
Do what you want with me, but
please don't stop investigating.

31:50.420 --> 31:53.050
- Then tell us what you know.
- I told you, I cannot.

31:53.073 --> 31:56.155
I know the facts as God, not as a man.

32:10.147 --> 32:12.478
What was that all about,
he knows the facts as God?

32:12.512 --> 32:14.867
He must've heard someone admit
to a crime in confessional,

32:14.878 --> 32:17.031
and under Catholic law, he
cannot tell us what he heard.

32:17.055 --> 32:18.805
- Well, that's ridiculous.
- To you, maybe,

32:18.839 --> 32:21.413
but if he told us what he heard,
he would be excommunicated.

32:21.453 --> 32:24.250
- So he's useless to us.
- Perhaps not.

32:29.617 --> 32:30.850
Julia...

32:30.975 --> 32:34.925
Dr. Ogden couldn't come, she had to
rush off. She's a very busy woman.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.937
Yes, she is. I understand.

32:39.986 --> 32:42.951
We examined Miss Beattie further.

32:42.980 --> 32:45.697
Her pelvic inlet was
widened, indicating she did

32:45.761 --> 32:48.299
indeed carry and deliver a child.

32:48.582 --> 32:49.871
Oh.

32:50.579 --> 32:51.904
Very good.

32:52.029 --> 32:53.533
Thank you, Miss Hart.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.089
This must be very difficult
for you, being a Catholic.

33:02.325 --> 33:04.933
I just wanted to let you
know that I understand.

33:05.132 --> 33:07.040
Are you a Catholic as well?

33:08.128 --> 33:10.488
I find it's my faith
that keeps me strong

33:10.534 --> 33:12.325
when the morgue becomes distressing.

33:13.356 --> 33:16.879
Yes. Yes, your composure
has been impressive.

33:16.937 --> 33:19.545
Many people might find
working with the dead...

33:19.614 --> 33:21.675
upsetting, to say the least.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.093
Honestly, I find it the perfect fit.

33:24.749 --> 33:27.805
In fact, I've been thinking
once I complete university

33:27.851 --> 33:29.993
that I, too, would like
to become a coroner.

33:30.206 --> 33:31.778
Indeed.

33:31.903 --> 33:34.455
Perhaps I'll even marry a detective.

33:44.201 --> 33:47.140
(DOOR OPENING)

33:50.051 --> 33:51.623
Father Jennings?

33:54.968 --> 33:58.066
If I tell you what I believe to be true,

33:58.385 --> 34:00.299
can you confirm if I'm correct?

34:00.305 --> 34:02.101
I said all I can.

34:02.136 --> 34:05.251
I had the statue made
and my blood filled it.

34:05.792 --> 34:08.204
- That's all you can tell me?
- Yes.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.895
I know Miss Beattie had a child,

34:13.483 --> 34:15.291
and I believe that child was the one

34:15.313 --> 34:18.565
- I found buried under the rosebushes.
- I can't answer that.

34:19.621 --> 34:22.014
Was it Miss Beattie
who confessed to you?

34:23.777 --> 34:25.953
Sir, you understand my dilemma.

34:26.376 --> 34:29.074
- And you understand mine.
- Yes.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.987
There is a way we can solve it.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.697
How?

34:38.594 --> 34:40.742
Attend the evening mass tonight.

34:41.293 --> 34:44.085
Stand at the pulpit and publicly confess

34:44.094 --> 34:47.503
that you ordered the statue
and that it was your blood.

34:48.733 --> 34:50.428
But that's not all you'll say.

34:57.364 --> 34:59.902
- Miss Newsome.
- Miss Bloom.

35:00.068 --> 35:02.394
Pardon my intrusion, but
I must speak with you.

35:02.408 --> 35:05.706
- Sorry, I'm not feeling well.
- I've come on behalf of Constable Higgins,

35:05.770 --> 35:08.077
who's just sick about
what happened that night...

35:08.091 --> 35:09.952
- Oh, please don't mention it.
- When a body landed right in front of you.

35:09.970 --> 35:11.181
You mentioned it.

35:12.116 --> 35:14.271
It didn't have anything to do with him.

35:14.639 --> 35:16.293
It was a sign from above.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.388
Our love... it wasn't meant to be.

35:20.314 --> 35:21.654
We're cursed.

35:21.779 --> 35:24.947
Constable Higgins is
nursing a broken heart.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.972
He's still in love with you.

35:28.290 --> 35:32.168
- Even though his proposal wasn't perfect...
- What proposal?

35:32.219 --> 35:34.522
- His marriage proposal.
- He was proposing marriage?

35:34.539 --> 35:36.446
- He got down on one knee!
- I thought he stumbled.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.343
I mean, I stumble all the time.
Just the other week when I was...

35:40.762 --> 35:42.250
He wants to marry me?

35:45.414 --> 35:47.597
My second suitor in a year.

35:51.553 --> 35:53.760
Good evening, everyone.

35:54.672 --> 35:56.312
If I could beg your indulgence

35:56.335 --> 35:58.416
before Father McGray's sermon,

35:59.623 --> 36:00.853
I have...

36:01.304 --> 36:03.902
something I need to confess to you all.

36:04.478 --> 36:06.638
I created a false miracle.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.802
The Virgin Mary isn't crying
tears of her own blood.

36:11.785 --> 36:13.915
- It's my blood.
- (MURMURS)

36:14.118 --> 36:15.634
You will ask, "Why?"

36:16.357 --> 36:17.996
And I say to you...

36:18.922 --> 36:21.036
there is evil in this church.

36:21.729 --> 36:25.421
There dwells within a sinner
who must confess publicly.

36:26.169 --> 36:29.686
I know that my actions will
cause my excommunication,

36:30.567 --> 36:34.067
but I will then be free to go to
the authorities with what I know.

36:35.305 --> 36:36.727
Please,

36:37.694 --> 36:39.243
forgive me.

- It's over,

Father.

37:15.849 --> 37:18.718
(MURMURS)

37:22.503 --> 37:24.501
I was protecting Miss Beattie.

37:25.307 --> 37:28.502
<i>She had a child out of
wedlock and that child died.</i>

37:28.853 --> 37:31.426
She buried him under the
rosebushes two years ago,

37:31.454 --> 37:35.010
but the guilt laid too heavily on her.

37:35.135 --> 37:36.860
She took her own life.

37:37.137 --> 37:40.521
So you were going to kill Father
Jennings to keep her secret.

37:40.837 --> 37:43.307
It meant so much to her in life.

37:43.750 --> 37:46.335
It was an evil impulse, I know,

37:46.560 --> 37:49.991
but I don't think I would've
really gone through with it.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.894
Do you think I will
serve any time in prison?

37:54.019 --> 37:55.662
I don't believe so.

37:56.209 --> 37:58.995
Your sentence will
most likely be hanging.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.539
- I beg your pardon?
- Two years ago, Father Jennings,

38:04.545 --> 38:07.089
while at St. Francis in Kitchener,

38:07.302 --> 38:09.087
took a confession from a man

38:09.104 --> 38:12.276
who admitted to fathering
a child out of wedlock.

38:12.739 --> 38:15.040
That man was a priest.

38:15.103 --> 38:16.778
Poor tortured soul.

38:17.441 --> 38:20.360
I believe the man in
the confessional was you.

38:20.872 --> 38:22.519
Well, it's not true.

38:23.878 --> 38:26.606
He sent that statue in
the hopes of scaring you

38:26.641 --> 38:29.055
into confessing to the authorities.

38:30.740 --> 38:33.181
The baby was yours, wasn't it?

38:36.267 --> 38:38.846
She was a deeply troubled woman.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.267
We found this note in the bell tower.

38:44.108 --> 38:45.840
"I cannot live with myself

38:45.880 --> 38:48.454
and this terrible secret any longer".

38:49.041 --> 38:51.620
She was going to expose you, wasn't she?

38:54.677 --> 38:56.594
We also found blood on the bell

38:56.612 --> 38:58.407
matching the wound on her head.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.916
Did you?

39:01.488 --> 39:04.070
This Virgin Mary miracle has unearthed

39:04.088 --> 39:07.277
a lot of dark secrets
for you, Father McGray.

39:07.974 --> 39:10.300
Secrets that just won't rest.

39:11.275 --> 39:16.557
<i>Josephine knew you killed the
baby and she was complicit.</i>

39:16.895 --> 39:18.975
<i>She couldn't live with it any longer.</i>

39:19.026 --> 39:21.379
<i>Her child deserved a proper burial.</i>

39:21.575 --> 39:23.991
- (GRUNTING)
- <i>But you couldn't do that,</i>

39:24.322 --> 39:27.525
<i>and Josephine wouldn't
keep quiet any longer.</i>

39:33.780 --> 39:35.507
So you killed her

39:35.557 --> 39:39.660
and planted this note to make it
appear as though it were a suicide.

39:40.329 --> 39:42.034
Isn't that right?

39:43.977 --> 39:45.474
I had to.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.281
You did not.

39:48.878 --> 39:51.015
I confessed

39:51.498 --> 39:54.373
before God.

39:55.391 --> 39:58.255
Why wasn't that enough?

40:06.782 --> 40:09.870
I can't believe that anyone would
fall for that miracle malarkey.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.317
Still, I believe some folk want to
believe there's something more out there.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.943
- Do you, Inspector?
- Do I 'eck as like, Murdoch.

40:15.986 --> 40:18.265
I believe in sleeping
in on a Sunday morning,

40:18.288 --> 40:21.004
followed by roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding in the afternoon.

40:21.062 --> 40:22.830
That's all the comfort I need.

40:35.023 --> 40:38.822
Higgins, there's all kinds
of single ladies in Toronto.

40:38.857 --> 40:41.362
All around the world,
as a matter of fact.

40:41.487 --> 40:44.451
I should travel the world
looking for a girl who'll have me?

40:44.486 --> 40:46.382
- That's your advice?
- Well, I mean,

40:46.388 --> 40:48.644
you know, start in your own backyard.

40:48.661 --> 40:50.250
As a matter of fact,

40:50.539 --> 40:54.459
- there's a local lady making her way over here right now.
- I've told you I don't...

40:59.341 --> 41:00.706
RuRu?

41:02.405 --> 41:04.310
I'll make myself scarce.

41:06.683 --> 41:08.157
Hello.

41:08.928 --> 41:11.456
Ruth, I... I wasn't expecting you.

41:12.141 --> 41:14.945
And I wasn't expecting
to seek you out either.

41:14.956 --> 41:18.393
Or to lose the hybrid tea rose
competition to Erma Birch last month.

41:20.932 --> 41:22.464
But here we are.

41:24.284 --> 41:26.131
I'm awful glad to see you.

41:26.362 --> 41:28.014
Are you?

41:29.816 --> 41:31.526
I was thinking...

41:32.280 --> 41:34.122
I can't imagine meeting

41:34.168 --> 41:37.271
a more honourable man than
you, Henry Higgins, and...

41:37.899 --> 41:40.254
if we have suffered a mishap,

41:41.308 --> 41:43.979
I suppose it should
only make us stronger.

41:44.779 --> 41:46.696
Ruth, what are you saying?

41:47.148 --> 41:48.947
That I must apologise to you.

41:49.166 --> 41:51.641
I do hope you can forgive my cruelty.

41:51.699 --> 41:53.374
You weren't cruel.

41:53.420 --> 41:54.957
Henry...

41:56.868 --> 41:59.281
There is one other thing
that I must say to you.

42:00.812 --> 42:02.522
What's that?

42:03.760 --> 42:06.109
Will you marry me?

42:08.297 --> 42:11.043
(STAMMERING)

42:11.112 --> 42:12.586
Yes!

42:12.614 --> 42:14.785
- Yes!
- Oh!

42:14.910 --> 42:17.721
Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

42:22.171 --> 42:23.737
Detective Murdoch,

42:24.526 --> 42:26.841
I must tell you I was
not pleased to learn

42:26.864 --> 42:29.870
you'd gone behind my back
to examine the statue.

42:30.319 --> 42:34.183
Yes, I'm sorry, Father. Police business.

42:34.229 --> 42:35.622
Nevertheless.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.799
I'll go to confession.

42:39.088 --> 42:40.458
Good day.

42:49.992 --> 42:53.279
I suppose we'll soon be asking
the Bishop for a baptism.

42:54.028 --> 42:55.473
William!

42:55.502 --> 42:58.305
I've just gotten used
to being with child.

42:58.430 --> 43:01.373
Let's take one step at a time.

43:06.543 --> 43:08.437
Is that Miss Hart?

43:08.562 --> 43:11.868
Yes, I believe it is. How curious.

43:12.179 --> 43:15.506
Well, she did tell me earlier
that she's also a Catholic.

43:15.754 --> 43:18.684
Perhaps it's not so strange
that she'd be at the burial.

43:18.938 --> 43:20.377
Well, that's odd.

43:20.411 --> 43:22.738
She told me she wasn't religious at all.

43:23.129 --> 43:24.729
Perhaps you misheard?

43:26.247 --> 43:27.607
Perhaps I did.

43:34.522 --> 43:37.682
