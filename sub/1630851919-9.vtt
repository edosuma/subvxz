WEBVTT

00:40.083 --> 00:41.250
You didn't have a choice.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.041
He knew what he was signing up for.

00:47.708 --> 00:48.958
We're done here.

00:49.541 --> 00:52.708
We haven't even scratched the surface.
Silco's still out there.

00:54.708 --> 00:57.708
Do you not understand?
I am part of this now!

00:59.250 --> 01:02.166
The next parents who get a message
their kid isn't coming home…

01:03.250 --> 01:05.000
I don't even know where to take it.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.000
Do we just leave him here?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.708
You've always been a part of this.

01:09.791 --> 01:12.375
You just never had to look it in the eye.
One dead kid?

01:12.458 --> 01:14.666
There's hundreds more where he came from,
thanks to Silco,

01:14.750 --> 01:17.666
and thanks to people like you
who stuck their heads in the dirt.

01:18.916 --> 01:21.000
-This is over.
-Not for me.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.666
Take those off.

01:31.541 --> 01:32.958
Make me.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.166
I can't let you leave with them.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.833
Then, I guess you're gonna need
to kill another trencher.

01:59.375 --> 02:00.708
You won't make it alone.

02:52.666 --> 02:55.666


02:55.750 --> 03:01.166


03:01.250 --> 03:07.708


03:15.250 --> 03:17.375


03:17.458 --> 03:20.708


03:41.208 --> 03:44.250
Been a while
since topside's gotten this bold.

03:44.333 --> 03:48.208
Say what you want about the late Sheriff.
He had his uses.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.375
Too bad Jinx didn't think so.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.958
We'll buy another.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.125
You gonna do anything

03:55.208 --> 03:58.041
about that piece of shit
that murdered my boy?

03:58.125 --> 04:01.500
Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it."

04:01.583 --> 04:04.916
Just like she's been taking care
of everything else.

04:06.041 --> 04:11.083
We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.

04:11.625 --> 04:18.416
At least, we have the solace of knowing
he died fighting for our cause,

04:18.500 --> 04:25.166
instead of some petty personal dispute,
as so often occurs here.

04:25.250 --> 04:28.875
You're one to talk
about sacrificing for the cause.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.583
Where is Jinx anyhow?

04:33.416 --> 04:35.208
Help her with the body.

05:14.708 --> 05:15.541
<i>Viktor…</i>

05:16.166 --> 05:18.958
<i>I know this will probably
never see the light of day,</i>

05:19.541 --> 05:23.625
<i>but watching how you work so tirelessly
to make the world a better place…</i>

05:24.333 --> 05:27.500
<i>Well, I couldn't forgive myself
if I didn't try.</i>

05:29.541 --> 05:31.708
<i>Everyone's gotta do
their part, right?</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:16.083
Okay.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.791
Noxian wine is bold by comparison.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.375
The grapes are hardened by the climate.

06:37.458 --> 06:41.458
But then, so is everything
that manages to survive in Noxus.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.916
-Mel, would you like--

06:49.083 --> 06:51.416
-Leave.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.916
-Hmm.
-Stay away from Jayce!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.416
You really are fond of him.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.166
Better yet, march back to your ship
and get the hell out of my city.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.208
Get ahold of yourself.
I taught you better.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.666
We're in trouble, Mel.

07:28.166 --> 07:31.250
The man who killed your brother
doesn't believe the score is settled,

07:31.333 --> 07:33.541
and his resources exceed ours.

07:33.625 --> 07:37.125
If there is a chance Hextech
can be weaponized, we must have it.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.541
Piltover isn't your testing ground.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.291
I've only accelerated
the process you started.

07:42.375 --> 07:45.125
I wanted to protect the city
from people like you.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.333
I can't believe you'd start a war
just to cover your ass.

07:49.416 --> 07:52.916
I would set the world ablaze
to protect our family.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.166
No.

07:54.250 --> 07:58.333
I stopped being part of this family
the moment you cast me out.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.958
Why? Why did you do it?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.416
Because you weakened me!

08:05.500 --> 08:08.791
I couldn't endure the look in your eyes
whenever I made the decisions,

08:08.875 --> 08:11.875
the necessary decisions to keep us safe!

08:19.041 --> 08:20.458
We need that weapon, Mel.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.291
Let the war unfold.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.250
And you come home,

08:27.958 --> 08:29.791
take your place at my side.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.291
It's where you belong.

08:44.583 --> 08:45.750
I'm sorry.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.541
I don't know where you'd have preferred.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.916
I'm sorry.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.458
Am I interrupting?

09:41.375 --> 09:44.041
Remember the Distinguished Innovators
competition?

09:45.333 --> 09:48.416
I remember you notching gears
in the carriage over.

09:49.833 --> 09:52.500
They started cranking the engine
and the whole thing was rattling.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.875
I thought a loose cog
was gonna take someone's eye out.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.833
At least, you didn't throw up.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.500
Everything made sense then.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.541
You have to destroy it.

10:08.125 --> 10:08.958
I know.

10:09.750 --> 10:10.583
The Hexcore.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.708
I… I can't do it.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.291
You have to. Please.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.000
What about your disease?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.083
-Without the Hexcore--

10:27.583 --> 10:29.291
Promise me.

10:32.791 --> 10:34.750
Okay. Okay.

10:35.541 --> 10:36.791
I promise.

10:38.583 --> 10:41.500
We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.

10:42.083 --> 10:47.041
In the pursuit of great,
we failed to do good.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.500
<i>We have to make it right.</i>

10:53.708 --> 10:56.458
-I'm busy.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.708
When you took Vander out of play,
I thought,

11:19.791 --> 11:23.958
"Now here's a man who understands
what it takes to run an enterprise."

11:24.041 --> 11:26.958
The attitude, the instinct, the eye.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.041
The whole package, you were.

11:29.875 --> 11:33.083
Always two steps ahead.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.958
But time's lapped you, old man.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.375
You're with him, are you?

11:42.958 --> 11:44.625
You screwed up, Silco.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.458
You're too young to remember
what the undercity was

11:50.541 --> 11:53.333
before it became an "enterprise".

11:54.250 --> 11:55.250
We had nothing.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.458
You know
what bore us through those times?

12:00.583 --> 12:01.875
Loyalty.

12:02.791 --> 12:06.291
Brothers and sisters back-to-back
against whatever the world threw at us.

12:07.166 --> 12:11.125
Now I'm forced to share the air
with parasites like you,

12:12.250 --> 12:14.666
who leach off their legacies.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.291
Today's the day you die, Silco.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.083
That's a risk I've known all my life.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.166
But I still believe in loyalty.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.833
I would have had your son killed for this.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.583
Though I suppose we're ahead
on that account.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.416
-Get out.

13:08.625 --> 13:09.875
Were you tempted?

13:10.625 --> 13:12.500
Not for a worm like him.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.791
But he won't be the last.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.166
Hmm.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.000
Perfect place for an ambush.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.625
And you without your hammer.

14:06.791 --> 14:10.125
I was reminded recently of what
brought us together in the first place.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.583
The threats beyond our walls.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.291
This city has a short memory.

14:15.958 --> 14:16.958
"Progress."

14:18.500 --> 14:20.833
Far be it from me to stand in the way.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.666
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,

14:42.750 --> 14:45.458
unrestricted access
to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

14:46.083 --> 14:48.458
Do you really think you're in a position
to demand all this?

14:48.541 --> 14:51.458
I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

14:51.541 --> 14:53.500
Didn't think you had the stomach.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.708
But the big display
followed by a request for parley,

14:57.500 --> 14:59.041
you're tipping your hand.

15:01.916 --> 15:03.083
You're afraid.

15:03.875 --> 15:04.916
I am afraid.

15:05.541 --> 15:08.375
Today, I got a glimpse
of what war between us might look like.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.708
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.791
The Council couldn't care less.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.625
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.208
Well, well.

15:22.958 --> 15:26.083
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge,
are you?

15:26.916 --> 15:29.000
You want peace, this is the price.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.916
You'll discontinue
the production of Shimmer?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.083
Half there already.

15:34.708 --> 15:35.791
Return the Gemstone.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.500
And I need Jinx.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.833
She has to pay for what she's done.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.958
They weren't her crimes.
She was working for me.

15:45.666 --> 15:49.583
Believe me, if I had it my way,
it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,

15:50.458 --> 15:53.416
but we can't make a deal
with a snake and cut off its head.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.083
We both have our shitty parts to play.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.666
Get me Jinx.
And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

16:32.916 --> 16:34.000
Astonishing.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.583
You say all this came about
in your own brief lifespan?

16:38.333 --> 16:41.791
How were you able to accomplish
so much so quickly?

16:41.875 --> 16:45.125
You'd be surprised what you can pull off
when your life depends on it.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.958
Uh, why this form?

16:49.041 --> 16:53.000
Surely, there are more efficient
and safer methods of transportation.

16:54.541 --> 16:55.958
Firelights!

16:56.041 --> 16:57.458
-Huh?
-Hmm?

17:02.375 --> 17:04.416
-Oh.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.958
It's not enough to give people
what they need to survive,

17:07.666 --> 17:09.750
you have to give them
what they need to live.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.500
A thousand times
I've imagined this moment.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.291
Never like this.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.083
All we ever wanted.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.791
The boy didn't even haggle.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.708
And what do I lose but problems?

17:37.875 --> 17:40.041
Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.

17:54.375 --> 17:58.333
Is there anything so undoing
as a daughter?

18:29.166 --> 18:31.583
-Damn it.

18:35.541 --> 18:36.666
-Piss off.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.916
Everyone out.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.625
Well, your guard needs working.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.083
I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.208
But I'd be lying.

21:17.166 --> 21:18.583
What I can say is…

21:19.166 --> 21:20.625
She still needs you.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.250
They all do.

21:22.916 --> 21:25.458
-So what do you say?

21:31.625 --> 21:32.750
That's my girl.

22:43.291 --> 22:44.625
Silco.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.625
Bravo, sis.

23:05.291 --> 23:06.541
<i>Councilors…</i>

23:07.250 --> 23:09.291
My recent unsanctioned activities

23:09.375 --> 23:11.750
in the underground
have shown me two things.

23:12.541 --> 23:15.250
I'm not fit to govern the people
who live there.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.208
And neither are you.

23:17.958 --> 23:20.416
Our opportunity
to demonstrate our compassion,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.166
our dedication,

23:23.083 --> 23:25.416
our solidarity has passed.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.000
They're right not to trust us.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.875
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

23:33.125 --> 23:36.625
With respect, I don't give a shit
what any of you think of me anymore.

23:39.666 --> 23:40.541
Except you.

23:41.541 --> 23:42.458
You were right.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.250
You were always right.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.208
My days here are numbered,
but I've come with Viktor,

23:48.875 --> 23:52.500
my partner and a Zaunite,
with one final proposal.

23:54.625 --> 23:58.000
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.833
In exchange for the undercity's
independence.

24:03.416 --> 24:06.541
What? Nonsense! We have procedures…

24:42.000 --> 24:44.583
Really thought I buried this place.

24:45.958 --> 24:48.625
But I should have known better.

24:49.791 --> 24:50.875
Powder?

24:50.958 --> 24:53.916
Nothing ever stays dead.

24:57.625 --> 24:58.916
Are we alone?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.916
-For now.

25:02.916 --> 25:04.333
Maybe forever.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.916
Wanna know a secret?

25:09.541 --> 25:11.375
Silco thinks he made Jinx,

25:11.875 --> 25:17.041
with all his rants
and his hard-won lessons.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.958
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

25:20.041 --> 25:21.833
"Be what they fear, Jinx."

25:21.916 --> 25:26.083
Like everything was the same
as when Vander left him.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.708
But he didn't make Jinx.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.333
You did.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.166
I'm sorry, Powder.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.791
I never meant to leave you.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.125
You never left.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.791
I always heard you.

25:43.875 --> 25:48.458
Shadows in the streets,
prickles on the back of my neck.

25:49.833 --> 25:51.708
Your voice.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.041
Pushing me.

25:54.125 --> 25:57.250
Picking me up
when all the colors were black.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.541
You're the reason I'm still alive.

26:01.708 --> 26:04.375
I spent so many nights
in that shitty prison.

26:04.458 --> 26:08.458
On the freezing floor,
hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.291
The only thing…

26:11.875 --> 26:15.291
The only thing that kept me going
was the thought of getting back to you.

26:19.958 --> 26:22.833
Are we still sisters?

26:24.375 --> 26:27.333
Nothing is ever going to change that.

26:31.625 --> 26:34.750
-I always knew you'd come back.
-What's going on?

26:50.125 --> 26:53.125
-No.
-He took everything from us.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.375
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.166
Just like he planned to do with me.

27:01.583 --> 27:04.916
<i>All the time saying
you abandoned me when he knew the truth.</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:07.541
Liar.

27:09.583 --> 27:12.041
Mm. We're missing someone.

27:36.833 --> 27:37.833
Huh?

27:42.958 --> 27:45.333
I paid your girlfriend
a visit this morning.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.958
What did you do?

27:48.833 --> 27:51.000
-I made her a snack.
-Huh?

27:56.333 --> 27:58.250
No!

27:58.333 --> 28:00.541
-Sheesh.

28:01.041 --> 28:02.375
I'm not that crazy.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.041
Powder! Leave her out of this.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.583
-Now…

28:25.708 --> 28:27.458
Where should I sit?

28:30.375 --> 28:32.916
That's your choice, really.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.541
Make her go away. Please.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.583
-Send her on her way and--

28:47.458 --> 28:49.916
And you can have Powder back.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.125
Mm.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.666
-I can't.
-Ah.

28:56.833 --> 28:58.916
No! Powder, listen.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.375
We… we can just go.

29:01.458 --> 29:03.708
-We'll leave and never come back.

29:04.291 --> 29:05.375
Where would we go?

29:05.958 --> 29:08.666
No, no, no. She's not saying that.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
It's true, we'll put this behind us.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.166
You'll never have
to see him again, Powder.

29:17.041 --> 29:19.041
What do you have to say about that?

29:21.333 --> 29:23.708
Her name is Jinx!

29:23.791 --> 29:25.041
She's lying.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.250
You'll be with her a day
before she realizes

29:27.333 --> 29:30.333
you aren't that girl anymore
and turns her back on you.

29:30.416 --> 29:31.416
Mm-hmm.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.166
You aren't lying?

29:34.250 --> 29:37.000
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

29:37.083 --> 29:38.166
I'm not lying.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.541
I'm on your side. I promise.

29:47.541 --> 29:50.500
Shut up! We're talking!

29:50.583 --> 29:52.875
The topsiders offered me everything.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.583
Independence, a seat at the table.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.708
All in return for you.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.708
They can all burn.

30:00.208 --> 30:04.125
Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.291
They will never understand.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.458
It's only us.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.208
You're my daughter.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.750
I'll never forsake you.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.708
-Drop the gun!

30:33.583 --> 30:35.791
No. Please.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.208
<i>It's time to leave them.</i>

30:46.291 --> 30:48.958
-No! Stop!

30:49.958 --> 30:51.666
Drop the gun.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.583
-Wait! She's my sister.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.541
Vi, she's too far gone.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.500
No, no, no.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.458
-Look out!

31:35.458 --> 31:37.833
You see, now finish it.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.666
Damn it! Powder, wake up!

31:41.208 --> 31:44.000
Remember who you are! I know you remember!

31:46.166 --> 31:50.791
-Picture Mylo! Claggor!
-Stop.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.041
-Vander!
-Shut up! Don't listen to her!

31:53.125 --> 31:55.708
-Dad!

31:55.791 --> 31:58.208
-<i>Mom!</i>

31:58.875 --> 32:01.125
-Me!

32:04.541 --> 32:05.708
No!

32:45.208 --> 32:46.791
No…

32:46.875 --> 32:48.458
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

32:48.541 --> 32:51.958
I'm sorry…

32:55.041 --> 32:57.333
I never would have given you to them.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.000
Not for anything.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.458
Don't cry.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.125
You're perfect.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.250
Powder?

33:40.791 --> 33:41.958
It's okay.

33:44.708 --> 33:45.875
We'll be okay.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.958
I thought maybe you could love me
like you used to.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.250
Even though I'm… different.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.458
But you changed too.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.333
So…

34:34.791 --> 34:36.291
Here's to the new us.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.541
<i>We'll show them.</i>

35:19.250 --> 35:20.750
<i>We will show them all.</i>

35:31.958 --> 35:35.250
I support Councilor Talis' proposal
for peace.
