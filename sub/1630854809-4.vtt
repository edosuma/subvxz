WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:03.525
Our drift has taken us right
into a collision course

00:03.525 --> 00:05.092
with an asteroid.
Impact'’s in six hours.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.919
- I'’m such an idiot.
- Why?

00:06.919 --> 00:08.660
- What do you see?
- The asteroid.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.576
- The asteroid which has a tail.
- So it'’s a comet?

00:11.576 --> 00:14.492
- Why does that matter now?
- Because comets
are made of ice.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.319
And ice means water.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.713
Deploying drill.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.631
- Water tanks are full!
- As of this moment,

00:22.631 --> 00:24.894
all water restrictions
have been lifted.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.642
I'’m so sorry.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.600
I thought you were in
a relationship with Jasper.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.387
That asshole is to blame
for Harris'’ death.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.216
I'’ve been to a lot of places.
I met a lot of people there.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.522
I believe her name was Denise.

00:46.481 --> 00:49.005
This biker guy
wouldn'’t take no for an answer

00:49.005 --> 00:51.094
from this woman,
and, um, check it out.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.501
Drought'’s over. Drink up.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.873
Good news.
That was the sound of our
engines coming back online.

01:30.873 --> 01:34.268
We'’re on the move.

01:34.268 --> 01:37.140
Give us the bridge.
Everyone out.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.103
What'’s this about?

01:45.844 --> 01:49.413
We found evidence implicating
a suspect in the murder.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.327
Well, who is it?

01:55.985 --> 01:57.465
You.

02:08.084 --> 02:11.087
- I don'’t know what this is.
- Bullshit.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.829
Jasper saw you kill a man.
You know what that does?

02:13.829 --> 02:15.483
It gives you motive
in his murder.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.050
Yeah, well, it must be fake.
That'’s not me.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.661
I have no choice, Lieutenant.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.271
I'’m putting you
under house arrest.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.709
Felix, that'’s not me
in the video.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.450
I didn'’t kill anyone.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.520
In light of Garnet'’s arrest,

02:52.520 --> 02:54.261
I'’ll be taking over
as acting commander.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.393
Well, there'’s a surprise.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.482
I find it hard to believe
that Garnet would commit murder.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.224
- Twice.
- If this proves anything,

03:01.224 --> 03:03.313
it only provides evidence
for one crime.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.967
It does not prove
she killed Malcolm Perry.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.883
Guys, can we just call him
Jasper, please?

03:07.883 --> 03:10.407
We need to make
a ship-wide announcement,
announce to the crew

03:10.407 --> 03:12.017
that Garnet has
betrayed their trust

03:12.017 --> 03:13.976
- and is under investigation.
- Absolutely not.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.195
This crew deserves the truth.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.458
This is an ongoing investigation.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.721
We'’re not parading
our best lead to every
possible suspect on the ship.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.071
Possible suspects?
We as good as caught her
red-handed.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.943
And she has a motive
to cover up the murder
that'’s on that video.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.945
It'’s a potential motive,
yes, but anyone on this ship

03:26.945 --> 03:29.774
could have reason to kill
Jasper, including you.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.647
- You can'’t be serious.
- This is my job.
I take it very seriously.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.563
- She'’s guilty.
- That is not your call to make.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.305
I will not stand by
and let you ruin
Lieutenant Garnet

03:38.305 --> 03:40.698
before
I'’ve determined the truth.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.787
Do not test me,
Lieutenant Lane.

03:58.150 --> 04:03.330
Did you hear that?
A baby crying.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.767
There are no babies
on this ship.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.836
Hello, Peter Potato,
Olivia Onion.

04:34.535 --> 04:38.974
Catie Cabbage. Hey.
You look awful.

04:42.891 --> 04:46.590
Hey. Hey, just tell
Papa Angus what'’s wrong.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.504
I'’ll make it all better.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.595
- Did you name the plants?
- What?

04:51.595 --> 04:53.554
No. No.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.991
Name the plants?
No, that would be dumb. No.

04:55.991 --> 04:59.168
Then, uh, who you talking to?

04:59.168 --> 05:03.825
I'’m trying to determine
why this cabbage patch
started wilting.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.958
Right, and you thought
it would tell you?

05:10.222 --> 05:12.573
Anyway, you need
to come with me.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.792
Why? I can'’t.
I can'’t leave now.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.360
- The plants need me now
more than ever.
- Well, don'’t worry.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.014
The kids will be fine
while Papa Angus is out.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.059
- Lieutenant, I can'’t--
- It'’s a new project.

05:21.059 --> 05:24.454
Top priority.
Come on. Let'’s go.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.289
Whoa.

05:34.638 --> 05:35.900
Cool.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.862
I mean, it'’s terrible.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.038
I'’m glad you still
have your hand.

05:43.038 --> 05:43.952
Mm.

05:48.696 --> 05:52.090
The glove is still intact?
It didn'’t all dissolve away?

05:52.090 --> 05:54.310
The reaction stopped
when it got back inside.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.498
Maybe when
the airlock repressurized,

06:08.498 --> 06:11.893
the oxygen-rich air
halted the reaction.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.286
We need you to analyze it,
see if you can use it

06:14.286 --> 06:16.506
to figure out exactly
what hit the ship.

06:16.506 --> 06:21.293
I don'’t think I'm
the right person for this job.
You need a scientist.

06:21.293 --> 06:24.949
You, um--
you grew plants
in space, right?

06:24.949 --> 06:27.387
- Well, yeah, but--
- And you made
your own fertilizer

06:27.387 --> 06:29.954
- and then figured out how
to make a bomb out of it.
- Sure, but that'’s just--

06:29.954 --> 06:32.304
And then that thing
that you just said
about the oxygen?

06:34.481 --> 06:35.482
You'’re a scientist, Angus.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.399
Science this.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.965
Wait, what about Dr. Kabir?

06:40.965 --> 06:42.619
Nope.
The doc is overwhelmed.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.492
Well, so am I.

06:45.492 --> 06:50.540
- The plants are sick.
- Listen, kid.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.150
We'’ve all been working
double or triple duty

06:52.150 --> 06:54.979
since we woke up,
and now it'’s your turn.

06:54.979 --> 06:59.549
Use your microscopes
and your spectro-analysis
thingamabob

06:59.549 --> 07:01.421
and you figure it out.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.426
It'’s called
a mass spectrometer.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.213
Can you account
for your whereabouts at
the time of Malcolm Perry,

07:11.213 --> 07:13.433
AKA Jasper Dades'’ death?

07:14.738 --> 07:17.524
Here in my quarters alone.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.482
Lieutenant,
why don'’t you sit down?

07:19.482 --> 07:22.311
This hostile attitude
is not going to help you
prove your innocence.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.622
I'’m going to tell you a story
of what I think happened here.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.537
Why do I get the feeling
I'’m not gonna like this story?

07:30.537 --> 07:33.801
I think that when
we found out Jasper was not
who he said he was

07:33.801 --> 07:37.544
and locked him up,
he saw an opportunity
to save his ass.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.242
He told you about the video,
that he had proof
that you were a killer.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.418
He told you he'’d leak the video

07:42.418 --> 07:45.203
if you tried to punish him
for impersonating Jasper.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.032
So you did the only
thing you could.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.208
You killed him
before he could talk.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.081
That makes absolute sense,

07:53.081 --> 07:56.171
but it'’s also absolutely wrong.
It'’s not me in the video.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.347
I authenticated the footage.
It has not been faked.

07:58.347 --> 08:02.438
- Don'’t lie to me.
- I'’m not lying.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.613
Then give me a reason
to believe you.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.236
That video was recorded in a bar
in Jacksonville, Florida,

08:18.236 --> 08:21.370
- a few weeks before launch.
- How do you know that?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.896
I just do.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.811
Check the timestamp.
You'’ll see.

08:27.811 --> 08:33.425
- Why does it matter?
- Because...

08:33.425 --> 08:35.602
...at that time
I was meeting
with Captain Lester

08:35.602 --> 08:38.996
- at the launch site.
- In London?

08:38.996 --> 08:40.824
I was an ocean away
from that bar

08:40.824 --> 08:43.174
when that video was taken.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.181
Where have you been?

08:50.181 --> 08:52.488
I'’ve just been checking
on engine cooling systems.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.664
We should have the engines
back up to near
light speed again soon.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.536
I don'’t know wanna talk
about the engines.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.059
I wanna talk about Garnet.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.496
- What about her?
- You know what.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.890
Strickland'’s being too easy
on her, don'’t you think?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.848
No idea.
We have to wait for his
investigation to close.

09:04.848 --> 09:08.548
Do you hear yourself?
The Lane I know
wouldn'’t stand for that.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.071
I'’m just trying to keep
the ship afloat.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.464
Look, Garnet is gonna
con her way out of this.

09:12.464 --> 09:15.076
She'’ll take over again,
and then we'’ll have
a murderer running the Ark.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.338
She is dangerous.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.906
Well, what are you
suggesting we do?

09:20.777 --> 09:23.301
I am suggesting that
we do everything we can

09:23.301 --> 09:25.652
to ensure the safety
of every living soul
on this ship.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.916
We need Garnet out of
the picture permanently.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.049
I never thought I'’d hear
such drastic measures
coming from you.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.704
Yeah, well, we need
to protect our crew.

09:34.704 --> 09:38.839
Look, Brice, Garnet,
she deserves to be thrown out

09:38.839 --> 09:40.318
of the airlock
for what she did,

09:40.318 --> 09:41.972
but if we do it before
Strickland proves her guilt,

09:41.972 --> 09:43.887
I mean,
no one will respect us.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.672
We have to follow the letter
of the law on this one.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.935
No. You see,
you'’re in charge now.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.720
So if you want justice,
real justice,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.201
then you need to take it
into your own hands.

10:26.887 --> 10:31.543
Um, I think I might
be going crazy.

10:31.543 --> 10:34.503
Ever heard of knocking?
I could'’ve been indecent.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.637
Unless you'’re hoping
that was the case.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.162
Robert is here on the Ark
roaming the halls

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
carrying my crying daughter.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.341
I can'’t seem to get
the crying out of my head,

10:46.341 --> 10:49.344
and no matter how close I get,
I can'’t reach them.

10:49.344 --> 10:52.521
But here'’s the thing,
there'’s no way
they could be here.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.784
0I left my husband
and daughter behind on Earth.

10:54.784 --> 10:59.223
Husband!
That explains your reaction
in the showers when we met.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.530
No wonder you weren'’t
interested in me.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.228
After everything
I'’ve just said,
that'’s your takeaway?

11:04.228 --> 11:08.450
I feel so much better now.
Thank you.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.151
Um, I'’m seeing
my husband and daughter.

11:14.151 --> 11:17.241
Oh, that. Yes.

11:17.241 --> 11:20.201
Not to worry.
You'’re not alone.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.290
I'’ve been hearing weird stories
from crew all over the ship.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.205
Natalie in engineering told me

11:24.205 --> 11:26.468
that she keeps finding herself
with her toes in the sand

11:26.468 --> 11:29.210
and beach waves rolling
over her feet.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.516
I think cabin fever
has been rearing
its ugly head.

11:31.516 --> 11:35.042
- Cabin fever?
- Yeah.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.044
We weren'’t supposed to be awake
on the ship for this long.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.003
An extended period of time
in a confined space like this?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.526
Of course we'’re all
going a little cuckoo.

11:44.442 --> 11:48.316
- That actually makes sense.
- Of course it does.

11:48.316 --> 11:51.972
I mean,
everyone just needs rest,
including you.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.452
I mean, look at me.
I'’ve been getting
plenty of sleep,

11:54.452 --> 11:56.063
and I'’m not having
any hallucinations.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.067
Take a nap. It'’ll go away.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.375
What do you think
of this color?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.077
Are you okay?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.469
You look a little tired.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.254
I'’m fine. Just one minute.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.094
Let'’s try that again.

12:27.094 --> 12:30.575
You shouldn'’t be having
this much trouble taking blood.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.621
This is med school 101, Sanji.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.493
I can come another time
if now'’s not good.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.408
No, no. Now is fine.

12:37.408 --> 12:41.108
Taking blood is 10% skill,
90% mental.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.807
- You'’re too in your head.
- Okay, you can relax.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.942
And I'’ll be right back.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.863
Three tries to take blood?

12:56.863 --> 12:59.300
I know you'’re a better
doctor than that.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.823
You think I don'’t know
I'’m screwing up?

13:00.823 --> 13:02.216
You were supposed to be here.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.870
You were supposed
to be in charge.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.263
You were supposed
to mentor me, prepare me.

13:06.263 --> 13:09.527
But you died along with
everyone else on our team,

13:09.527 --> 13:12.922
so I'’m the only doctor left,
and I'’m doing the best I can.

13:12.922 --> 13:17.318
You had to insist
on being in the officer'’s
and elite cryopod bay.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.973
Like it even mattered
when you were in stasis.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.323
As I explained to you then,
it mattered because

13:22.323 --> 13:24.760
it inferred status
once we woke up.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.327
Yeah, well,
how'’s your status now?

13:26.327 --> 13:30.331
Because you had cryoed
in the bay I did,

13:30.331 --> 13:32.028
you might be alive right now.

13:32.028 --> 13:35.902
You need sleep,
and you need to get off
those pills.

13:35.902 --> 13:39.340
- You know better.
- You'’re right.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.472
In fact,
those are the two factors

13:41.472 --> 13:43.126
probably causing me
to see you.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.912
It'’s too bad I've got
no other doctors to help

13:45.912 --> 13:47.565
and no end in sight.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.099
I don'’t know what
you'’re waiting for.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
I'’ve just seen Strickland
head into the showers.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.276
Now is our chance.
Let'’s go and get rid of Garnet.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.408
Keep your voice down.
Someone might hear you.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.585
Let them hear me.
Listen, I am ready
to kill that traitor.

14:07.585 --> 14:10.762
- She deserves it.
- People are staring.
Be quiet.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.635
Pathetic. You know,
I thought we were a team.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.158
This ship could be ours.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.638
But, no,
you'’re gonna let her
get away with this.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.814
We have to do this
the right way.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.123
Who you talking to?

14:26.778 --> 14:29.956
Get out of my way
or I'’ll kill you!

14:31.479 --> 14:33.568
Get out of my way
or I'’ll kill you!

14:33.568 --> 14:36.614
Hey!

14:36.614 --> 14:39.574
- Leave me alone!
- Hey, hey! Hey, stop it!

14:39.574 --> 14:43.404
Stop it! There'’s nothing there!
It'’s in your head, all right?

14:43.404 --> 14:47.625
Enough! It'’s all right!

14:47.625 --> 14:51.064
Found him like this
in the hall

14:51.064 --> 14:54.154
going at it like he'’s in
the middle of a boxing ring.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.417
You did the right thing
bringing him here.

15:01.683 --> 15:06.209
Interesting.
Do you think he has
a drug problem, too?

15:06.209 --> 15:09.038
I hate to admit it,

15:09.038 --> 15:12.433
but I'’ve been having
strange visions as well.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.130
My dead boss
is standing behind you.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.700
- What about you two?
- Not me, no.

15:18.700 --> 15:24.140
- Haven'’t seen anything.
- Lane, I take it you'’ve seen
something or someone?

15:24.140 --> 15:27.230
Oh, right, so that'’s who you
were talking to on the bridge.

15:27.230 --> 15:31.669
- Who was it?
- Just Captain Lester.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.584
What do you think
is causing it, doc?

15:33.584 --> 15:35.760
I'’m gonna run some tests,
see what answers I can find.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.068
If you see anyone
having a manic episode,
bring them straight here.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.724
They'’re not only
a danger to themselves,
but to everyone onboard.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.552
Thank you.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.607
Angus'’s farm
isn'’t really producing
much that'’s edible yet,

15:56.607 --> 15:58.261
but I managed
to find these radishes

15:58.261 --> 16:00.089
and I stole a leaf from
the first head of lettuce.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.222
But don'’t tell anyone.
Angus will kill me.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.614
Do you think that
the kitchen closed early

16:03.614 --> 16:04.920
because of what
happened to Vito?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.400
I heard that
he was hallucinating.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.707
Do you ever take a second
to breathe when you talk?

16:09.707 --> 16:11.274
I talk a lot
when I'’m nervous.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.581
I told you.
You don'’t have to be nervous.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.887
Hey, I'’m the one
who asked you out, remember?

16:17.324 --> 16:18.194
Shall we?

16:21.502 --> 16:23.199
Thank you for those.

16:26.115 --> 16:30.076
What exactly do you think
you'’re doing, young lady?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.078
I know. Radish.
Kinda hard, right?

16:33.688 --> 16:36.734
Your wasting time
with this boy.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.824
Uh, um, excuse me.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.436
I need to go freshen up
real quick.

16:46.527 --> 16:50.139
She seems a little young
for you.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.359
I was young for you,
and you didn'’t seem to mind.

16:54.622 --> 16:58.756
Why do I keep seeing you, huh?
Am I being haunted?

16:58.756 --> 17:03.631
Well, maybe it'’s
because you'’re distracted
by pretty girls

17:03.631 --> 17:06.025
instead of staying focused
on the mission.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.508
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm.

17:11.508 --> 17:15.251
Did you sleep with me
just to get me to be a part
of your secret mission?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.997
At first, yeah.

17:23.738 --> 17:24.826
But then...

17:30.353 --> 17:32.703
...I started to enjoy you.

17:37.447 --> 17:41.973
And I think
you enjoyed me, too,

17:41.973 --> 17:44.063
if I'’m not mistaken.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.634
So it was just sex.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.641
I fell in love with you,
you know?

17:59.904 --> 18:02.733
I know.

18:02.733 --> 18:06.520
We do what we have to do
to recruit the likeminded.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.522
I don'’t think
there are any of us

18:08.522 --> 18:10.089
left alive on this ship.

18:10.089 --> 18:16.051
That pretty young thing,
she certainly isn'’t one of us.

18:16.051 --> 18:19.402
But based from what
I observed at the launch,

18:19.402 --> 18:21.404
you know who I suspect will be?

18:21.404 --> 18:25.626
- Who?
- Lieutenant Lane.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.759
- Keep an eye on that one.
- I was thinking the same thing.

18:37.159 --> 18:42.643
Mom'’s not here, okay?
She'’s on Earth.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.427
You'’re just freaking out

18:44.427 --> 18:46.429
because this
is your first real date.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.258
Okay.
Just take a deep breath.

18:51.608 --> 18:54.611
And relax.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.875
You absolutely should not
be relaxing, Alicia Nevins.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.442
Go away!
You'’re not real.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.965
You'’re throwing away
your potential

19:00.965 --> 19:02.793
by spending time
with this boy.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.404
He likes me and I like him.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.667
You should be pushing
yourself to be better,

19:06.667 --> 19:08.495
excelling, not dating.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.209
Not now, please.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.695
What do you want from me?

19:34.695 --> 19:36.914
Hmm? To say I'’m sorry?

19:36.914 --> 19:39.700
To say I regret getting on
this godforsaken ship at all?

19:39.700 --> 19:42.268
Because I do.
I never should'’ve left.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.921
If I could be in two places
at once, I would be,

19:43.921 --> 19:45.358
but I can'’t, so...

19:52.713 --> 19:54.497
She was telling the truth.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.587
She can'’t be
in two places at once.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.853
Brice, we need to talk.

20:02.853 --> 20:06.727
There were some inconsistencies
in your medical history.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.163
What are you hiding from us?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.345
What the hell
are you talking about?

20:16.345 --> 20:18.173
Listen, you need to
let me out right now.

20:18.173 --> 20:21.045
- I can'’t do that, Brice.
- Let me out.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.570
- You could be endangering
yourself and others.
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.747
To be safe, I'’m going to run
a complete blood analysis.

20:26.747 --> 20:29.315
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

20:29.315 --> 20:33.319
Let me go.
Let me out! Now!

20:33.319 --> 20:37.279
Get off me! Help! Help!

20:37.279 --> 20:40.848
Are you all right?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.680
- Wait, was I just, uh--
- Hallucinating.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.508
Yeah, seems to
be going around.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.770
I just ran away from my mom

20:49.770 --> 20:52.033
who was haunting me
in the locker room.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.034
What do you see?

20:54.992 --> 20:56.603
Right.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.911
You verified my intel.
Why aren'’t you releasing me?

21:00.911 --> 21:03.044
How did you know
the timestamp would match?

21:03.044 --> 21:05.612
- Does it matter? I was right.
- Every detail matters.

21:05.612 --> 21:06.787
This is a murder investigation.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.484
Right now
you'’re our lead suspect.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.747
- I just gave you an alibi.
- For the murder on that video,

21:10.747 --> 21:12.575
not for the one on this ship.

21:12.575 --> 21:13.881
And the video still
gives you motive

21:13.881 --> 21:15.143
if Jasper
was blackmailing you.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.972
He had nothing
to blackmail me for.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.017
- That'’s not me in the tape.
- Please explain that.

21:20.017 --> 21:20.888
How is that not you?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.937
What I'’m about to tell you
is classified above your level.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.983
If you tell anyone, it'’s
a court martial-able offense.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.158
I'’m not military.

21:31.986 --> 21:35.598
I'’m asking you to agree
to confidentiality, please.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.428
I can'’t agree
to confidentiality

21:39.428 --> 21:42.126
until I know
if it'’s information
that helps my case.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.532
Her name'’s Denise.
Denise Garnet.

21:58.534 --> 22:01.668
<i>We were clones born in
a classified government lab.</i>

22:04.279 --> 22:06.063
<i>We never knew where
the donor cell came from</i>

22:06.063 --> 22:08.805
<i>other than that
it was completely human.</i>

22:08.805 --> 22:13.854
<i>Then they introduced
additional experimental DNA
into our systems.</i>

22:13.854 --> 22:15.856
<i>They used different
DNA strands in each of us,</i>

22:15.856 --> 22:18.032
<i>testing us
for different outcomes.</i>

22:18.032 --> 22:20.904
<i>Mine was tardigrade DNA.</i>

22:23.037 --> 22:26.345
<i>I don'’t know what
they put in Denise.</i>

22:26.345 --> 22:28.695
<i>Since we were clones,
we were identical in every way,</i>

22:28.695 --> 22:32.307
<i>so we were the perfect subjects
to compare and contrast.</i>

22:32.307 --> 22:34.831
<i>They wanted to see
if they could push the limits</i>

22:34.831 --> 22:37.312
<i>of human function
for space travel.</i>

22:37.312 --> 22:40.315
<i>How fast could we recover
from zero gravity?</i>

22:40.315 --> 22:42.926
<i>How long could we last
without oxygen?</i>

22:42.926 --> 22:46.539
<i>For example, I can withstand
more solar radiation
than you can.</i>

22:46.539 --> 22:49.672
<i>Then one day
when we were older,</i>

22:49.672 --> 22:52.893
<i>Dr. Hall was testing how long
we could hold our breath</i>

22:52.893 --> 22:55.896
<i>and Denise suddenly
started acting out.</i>

22:55.896 --> 22:59.813
<i>Her brain was rejecting
the gene augmentation.</i>

22:59.813 --> 23:02.119
<i>She'’d have these
violent outbursts.</i>

23:02.119 --> 23:04.339
<i>One minute
she was totally fine,</i>

23:04.339 --> 23:06.428
<i>and the next...</i>

23:06.428 --> 23:09.953
<i>...she'’d turn into
a completely different person.</i>

23:17.700 --> 23:20.050
When I returned to Florida,

23:20.050 --> 23:23.314
after my meeting in London,

23:23.314 --> 23:24.664
I found Denise'’s body.

23:27.710 --> 23:28.929
She'’d taken her own life.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.717
I'’m so sorry.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.632
Cloning was outlawed years ago

23:36.632 --> 23:39.200
partially because of
adverse reactions like that.

23:39.200 --> 23:43.334
Which is why the program
is top secret,

23:43.334 --> 23:45.380
which is why I'’m top secret.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.165
You must know how people feel
about people like me.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.385
They fear what
they don'’t understand.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.129
I completed the genetic trials
and was assigned to this Ark

23:55.129 --> 23:56.130
to see if all worked.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.177
One final experiment.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.441
No one else knows
and no one else can know.

24:03.833 --> 24:04.660
Are we clear?

24:22.896 --> 24:25.986
I asked Cat to join us
to present about
the hallucinations.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.988
The hallucinations
initially seemed harmless,

24:27.988 --> 24:31.078
but have quickly taken on
more dangerous side effects.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.517
What the hell
is she doing here?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.432
I concluded Lieutenant Garnet
is innocent.

24:38.607 --> 24:39.869
How?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.915
That information is classified.

24:41.915 --> 24:42.959
Classified by who?

24:44.308 --> 24:45.179
GSA.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.358
I told you she was gonna
con her way out of this.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.187
We should'’ve killed her
when we had the chance.

24:53.187 --> 24:57.887
All right,
so if she didn'’t do it,
then who did?

24:57.887 --> 25:01.195
Strickland has thoroughly
explored every avenue
brought to him thus far.

25:01.195 --> 25:04.154
I have faith in his ability
to close the investigation.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.113
Now get me up to speed.

25:06.113 --> 25:10.247
Bio shelter'’s a mess,
plants are dying,
Angus is a wreck.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.249
Half of my crew
are in med bay.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.468
Engines can'’t get up
to near light speed

25:13.468 --> 25:16.471
with that many people out.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.952
What do we know about
these hallucinations?

25:18.952 --> 25:22.172
Med bay is filling up fast.
Kabir'’s trying to figure it out.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.136
That'’s new.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.574
And not good.

25:35.446 --> 25:36.665
Sedate her!

25:39.233 --> 25:42.236
- It'’s getting worse.
- And it'’s happening fast.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.367
Okay, okay.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.259
I'’ve been waiting for you.

26:15.269 --> 26:18.098
I heard about people
having visions,

26:18.098 --> 26:20.579
and I was so hoping
I'’d get to see you.

26:22.493 --> 26:23.364
Well...

26:25.975 --> 26:26.802
...I'’m here now.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.725
I miss you so much.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.865
Have you tried finding closure?

26:45.865 --> 26:48.911
- Closure?
- During your last session,

26:48.911 --> 26:50.957
you told me that
you blamed the imposter,

26:50.957 --> 26:53.612
the fake Jasper,
for Harris'’ death.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.700
I don'’t wanna talk about him.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.225
In order to help you heal,

26:58.225 --> 27:00.314
I need to know how deep
that hatred runs.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.490
What do you mean?

27:05.362 --> 27:07.713
Did you hate Jasper
enough to hurt him,

27:07.713 --> 27:08.975
kill him even?

27:11.847 --> 27:14.241
Oh, my. You did.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.939
Please, you have
to keep my secret.

27:16.939 --> 27:21.335
Secret? You'’re a murderer.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.945
We have
patient-client privilege.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.555
You can'’t tell anyone or else.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.688
Or else what?
You'’ll kill me, too?

27:28.124 --> 27:31.345
I'’m sorry.
I have to do this.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.651
Then I have to do this.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.186
I was just coming to see you.

27:46.186 --> 27:48.928
I started having hallucinations.

27:48.928 --> 27:49.885
Harris.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.193
No more sessions today.

27:53.193 --> 27:56.022
In fact, all sessions canceled
till further notice.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.635
You don'’t need her...

28:02.115 --> 28:04.378
...or anyone else
for that matter.

28:04.378 --> 28:07.424
"It'’s your turn to pull
double duty, Angus.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.165
We'’ve all done it Angus."

28:10.689 --> 28:13.082
What does Brice know
about double duty?

28:13.082 --> 28:15.476
I bet he doesn'’t even know
what a mass spectrometer does.

28:17.652 --> 28:21.395
I thought I told you
to relax, Angus.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.092
Nope! No, no.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.354
You'’re not real.
You are not real.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.402
This place is so romantic,

28:28.402 --> 28:30.534
don'’t you think?

28:30.534 --> 28:32.014
The real Garnet would never
say something like that.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.537
You'’re just a figment
of my subconscious.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.888
Oh, I'’m as real
as you want me to be.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.156
- I'’m just trying to help.
- I don'’t need your help.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.288
I need answers.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.726
We'’re gonna end up with no food
and everyone will blame me.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.687
You'’re my genius.
You'’ll figure it out.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.214
Maybe they need
some more water.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.434
Well, I guess you don'’t
think I'’m such a genius

29:00.434 --> 29:02.653
if you don'’t think
I'’m carefully regulating

29:02.653 --> 29:04.133
the amount of water that...

29:06.353 --> 29:08.007
- You'’re a genius.
- Mm-hmm.

29:08.007 --> 29:11.097
If you were real,
I'’d kiss you.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.838
Actually, no I wouldn'’t.
You'’re my boss. That's weird.

29:22.369 --> 29:25.981
- Dr. Kabir, it'’s the water.
- What?

29:28.375 --> 29:30.116
The comet.

29:34.076 --> 29:37.688
Hold on, Angus.
Hold on. Okay.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.082
Okay.

29:40.082 --> 29:43.825
Damn it, he'’s unresponsive.
What was he trying to tell me?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.827
Did he say
it'’s in the comet water?

29:50.136 --> 29:52.573
On the right,
you can see Vito'’s blood sample.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.750
You'’ll notice an anomaly
amongst the red blood cells.

29:55.750 --> 30:00.363
The same anomaly is present
in every patient.

30:00.363 --> 30:03.802
- And this is our water.
- But how did it get through
our filtration system?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.891
It was specifically designed
to stop trace elements.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.807
Well,
the foreign toxin is smaller
than a water molecule.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.547
It'’s a compound
not found on Earth,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.158
so our systems couldn'’t
have been prepared for it.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.508
Hate to rush you,
but you'’re running out of time.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.946
You all are.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.949
I ran the toxin through
the GC mass spec

30:20.949 --> 30:22.690
to get a better idea
of what we'’re dealing with.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.387
I'’m guessing it's not good.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.347
It'’s structure is similar
to ergot alkaloids on Earth.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.828
LSD is a derivative
of those same compounds.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.873
Well, that explains
the hallucinations.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.484
This new toxin
is targeting brain function,

30:34.484 --> 30:35.921
cardiovascular systems,

30:35.921 --> 30:37.618
and electrical signals
in the body.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.229
Hallucinations,
seizures, coma.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.102
The disease is progressing
at different speeds
in different people.

30:43.102 --> 30:46.148
There'’s no predicting
when people will seize
or go into coma.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.412
Next, I'’m afraid
people will start dying.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.066
I'’ll walk you back
to the med bay.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.676
I want to assess
the situation.

30:52.676 --> 30:55.418
- I'’ll come too.
- No, I don'’t need a babysitter.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.943
Strickland cleared me.
Move on.

31:00.162 --> 31:03.600
I need to tell you something,
something classified.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.168
I figured this
might have been more
than a friendly stroll.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.171
I'’m a clone.
My DNA has tar--

31:09.171 --> 31:13.175
- Tardigrade genomes.
- You know?

31:13.175 --> 31:15.221
When I was assigned to the Ark,

31:15.221 --> 31:19.616
I was briefed on high priority
classified medical conditions.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.010
Dr. Hall oversaw
your program, correct?

31:22.010 --> 31:25.622
- You knew Edward?
- Well, he was Dr. Hall to me,

31:25.622 --> 31:27.059
my boss and mentor.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.409
He recruited me for the Ark

31:29.409 --> 31:31.454
even after he saw me
at my worst.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.630
- He was a good man.
- Yeah.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.371
Closest thing
I ever had to a father.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.896
She never told me that.

31:37.896 --> 31:42.204
I don'’t know
if this will be a comfort
or unsettling for you,

31:42.204 --> 31:44.903
but I'’ve been
hallucinating Dr. Hall.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.817
He'’s standing beside us.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.215
I wish I could talk to him.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.696
- This ship can
make you feel so--
- Alone?

31:58.438 --> 31:59.700
You can trust me.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.879
The one thing
I don'’t understand

32:04.879 --> 32:09.057
is why come to me now
about your genetics?

32:09.057 --> 32:11.233
I'’ve been drinking the water
just as long as everyone else,

32:11.233 --> 32:14.062
but I'’ve had no hallucinations.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.499
If you can find out why,
maybe you can find a cure.

32:39.479 --> 32:42.395
Garnet'’s blood
produces a protein
the rest of us don'’t have.

32:42.395 --> 32:47.835
I guess it'’s a result
of the tardigrade DNA
you put in her as a child.

32:47.835 --> 32:52.057
- It'’s creating a protein
that neutralizes the toxin.
- That makes sense.

32:52.057 --> 32:55.669
We chose tardigrade DNA because
of its self-healing nature.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.497
If I can synthesize enough

32:57.497 --> 32:59.194
and determine
a distribution mechanism,

32:59.194 --> 33:01.109
maybe we could
solve this thing.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.763
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

33:06.810 --> 33:08.290
I need to know
what you told Strickland

33:08.290 --> 33:10.336
to weasel your way
out of custody.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.991
Here I was thinking
you were pulling me
aside to apologize

33:12.991 --> 33:14.514
for wrongly accusing me
of murder.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.168
If the GSA classified the intel,

33:16.168 --> 33:18.039
I have a right
to know what it is.

33:18.039 --> 33:21.129
The investigation
is under Strickland'’s
jurisdiction, not yours.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.479
He'’s not even military.
You and I have the same rank.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.568
Then maybe you should
start treating me like it

33:25.568 --> 33:27.744
instead of trying to undercut
everything I say and do.

33:27.744 --> 33:30.530
- I need you to trust me.
- Why?

33:30.530 --> 33:32.836
You don'’t even trust me
enough to let me...

33:35.056 --> 33:37.885
Lane? Lane?

33:39.756 --> 33:42.759
Dr. Kabir!
Quick, it'’s Lane!

33:42.759 --> 33:45.240
Oh, this just gets
better and better.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.937
What do-- what do we do?

33:46.937 --> 33:48.156
How the hell should I know?

33:55.294 --> 33:57.035
Tell me you know
what Kabir was planning
to do with that vial.

33:57.035 --> 34:01.648
I have some idea,
but I don'’t have a clue
what we do next.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.171
All right.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.785
I came as fast as I could.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.352
We need you to decipher
Kabir'’s work fast.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.441
It could be a cure.

34:12.441 --> 34:15.009
- Huh.
- Is that a good huh
or a bad huh?

34:15.009 --> 34:17.794
The sample from patient X
has an unusual protein

34:17.794 --> 34:20.145
that appears to neutralize
the toxin in the blood.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.581
Kabir was trying
to synthesize it.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.800
- Do you think it could work?
- Maybe.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.325
I wonder why the symbol
for water is here.

34:27.587 --> 34:30.155
She was creating
a water soluble protein.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.809
She synthesized this sample
to be hydrophilic.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.203
So did she want to
put it in the water?

34:35.203 --> 34:37.945
But isn'’t the water
how the toxins have been
poisoning everyone?

34:37.945 --> 34:42.123
- Why not inject
the cure directly?
- We don'’t have time.

34:42.123 --> 34:45.474
Injecting crew one at a time
with no medical staff
would take forever.

34:45.474 --> 34:48.042
It looks like Dr. Kabir
thought that putting the protein

34:48.042 --> 34:50.827
in the water system would create
a faster distribution system

34:50.827 --> 34:52.786
and make the water safe
for future use.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.570
So you'’re just saying

34:54.570 --> 34:56.790
we need to put whatever'’s
in this vial into the water

34:56.790 --> 34:57.921
and that'’s gonna cure us all?

34:57.921 --> 34:59.619
First,
we need a whole lot more

34:59.619 --> 35:01.186
and hope
that it cures us all.

35:01.186 --> 35:04.014
- Hope?
- Her notes are pretty thorough.

35:04.014 --> 35:07.105
So it'’s an educated guess,
but a guess just the same.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.763
Do it.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.800
Oh.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.698
I knew you'’d figure it out.

36:18.698 --> 36:22.658
You'’re the one who figured out
it was in the water.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.313
Actually,
Lieutenant Garnet said
something that reminded me.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.318
I mean, she did
in a hallucination.

36:30.318 --> 36:35.280
So I guess technically
it was me who figured it out.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.717
Uh, Angus?

36:37.717 --> 36:40.285
Our hallucinations
are tied to actual fears

36:40.285 --> 36:43.375
or fantasies in our brains.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.464
- They are?
- Yes.

36:45.464 --> 36:48.206
So, um...

36:48.206 --> 36:51.426
why were you hallucinating
about Lieutenant Garnet?

36:51.426 --> 36:53.646
Oh, uh, no reason.

36:53.646 --> 36:56.170
I mean, I don'’t fear her.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.782
Or fantasize about her.

36:59.782 --> 37:02.263
Which would imply something
I would never even think.

37:02.263 --> 37:05.571
I mean, no, she'’s my boss.
That would be weird.

37:07.094 --> 37:07.964
Hey.

37:09.923 --> 37:10.793
You good?

37:18.061 --> 37:19.585
Welcome back.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.543
- What happened?
- You were in the middle

37:21.543 --> 37:23.197
of yelling at me
for keeping secrets

37:23.197 --> 37:25.243
and then you seized
and went into a coma.

37:26.766 --> 37:30.248
- Huh.
- By the way, you'’re welcome.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.599
- For what?
- That'’s classified.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.578
I'’m proud of you,
you know that?

37:56.578 --> 37:59.538
- Really? You are?
- Of course I am.

37:59.538 --> 38:00.930
Look what you did today.

38:02.497 --> 38:06.022
Just don'’t let
that boy distract you.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.262
You'’re wasting your time
with that one.

38:31.483 --> 38:34.660
You know what I think?
I think you'’re jealous.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.055
Maybe a little.

38:39.055 --> 38:43.059
And I don'’t want you
wasting your time with her.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.366
Get closer to Lieutenant Lane.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.934
I don'’t have to listen
to you anymore.

38:47.934 --> 38:51.677
- Sure you do.
- No.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.012
She won'’t drink the water.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.409
- I don'’t want it.
- You'’ll die.

39:34.676 --> 39:37.070
Oh, honey.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.246
You don'’t want to say
good-bye to Harris, do you?

39:43.642 --> 39:45.339
Do you feel this?

39:45.339 --> 39:48.516
This is real.
My hand in yours.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.127
This ship is real.

39:51.127 --> 39:54.522
This crew who
depends on you is real.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.830
Harris is gone.

40:00.746 --> 40:05.925
- Cat'’s right about almost
everything she said.
- Almost?

40:05.925 --> 40:08.928
He'’s not gone.
Our hallucinations are proof

40:08.928 --> 40:12.540
that the people who matter to us
never truly leave us.

40:12.540 --> 40:17.110
Harris came back to you
to show you he'’s still with you.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.460
- And he will be even
after you drink the water.
- Yeah.

41:19.738 --> 41:20.739
Holy shit.

41:20.739 --> 41:23.916
I have a formal request

41:23.916 --> 41:25.483
that we stop bringing
space stuff onto the ship.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.919
What are you talking about?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.921
I finished analyzing
the residue from your glove.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.533
Do you want a drumroll?

41:32.533 --> 41:37.016
Whatever hit us is made of
a completely unknown element.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.061
Separate and apart from
the toxin in the water?

41:39.061 --> 41:40.715
Yes, that was
a complex molecule,

41:40.715 --> 41:42.804
a combination of stuff
we'’ve seen before.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.980
This is a basic element.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.939
Think high school chemistry,
the periodic table.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.549
Yeah, I skipped
high school chemistry.

41:48.549 --> 41:52.074
Except this element,
it'’s not on the periodic table.

41:52.074 --> 41:55.251
So are you any closer
to knowing what hit us or not?

41:55.251 --> 41:58.646
Well, it'’s made
of something that hasn'’t
been discovered on Earth,

41:58.646 --> 42:00.822
which means it probably
doesn'’t exist on Earth.

42:00.822 --> 42:02.781
That means it'’s found
somewhere else.

42:02.781 --> 42:05.784
Right, I feel like
you'’re keeping
the punchline to yourself.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.439
It could'’ve been a meteor

42:09.439 --> 42:12.181
or some other rock formation,

42:12.181 --> 42:15.358
- or...
- Or what?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.798
- It could'’ve been a weapon.
- A weapon?

42:19.798 --> 42:21.451
Engineered to take advantage
of this dangerous element.

42:21.451 --> 42:24.280
But who could'’ve attacked us?

42:24.280 --> 42:26.587
We'’re the only people in history
to go this far in space.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.589
I didn'’t say people.
