WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:03.811
Previously onSEAL Team...I was always the one leaving.

00:03.870 --> 00:04.859
It sucks staying behind.

00:04.910 --> 00:06.901
I know you miss it.I'll miss you.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.086
Forgot I promised Gordon
I'd meet him for drinks.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.688
Gordon, huh?I need to go, and you need

00:09.740 --> 00:11.696
to talk about your paranoid
fantasies tomorrow.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.354
JASON: So you're telling me
you don't need any surgery?

00:13.400 --> 00:15.049
Nope. Doc fixed me up

00:15.100 --> 00:16.579
with some heaw duty
anti-inflammatories.

00:16.620 --> 00:17.609
Told me not to bench
with a straight bar.

00:17.660 --> 00:18.615
Stop being worried.

00:18.670 --> 00:19.705
I'm good. [groans]

00:19.750 --> 00:21.445
That's Steve Porter's drill.

00:21.490 --> 00:24.050
He got something on it
during an op.Mm-hmm.

00:24.110 --> 00:25.498
And he asked me if I'd have
our labs test it.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.098
JASON: Why did he, uh,
give it to you guys

00:27.150 --> 00:28.708
and not the military lab?

00:28.760 --> 00:30.068
AMY: I never really
thought about it.

00:30.110 --> 00:31.327
You're asking permission
to go after

00:31.370 --> 00:32.678
Salim Hakan, the Afghan
police commander.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.369
MANDY: I know Salim's
the new poster boy

00:34.420 --> 00:35.933
for our mission here,

00:35.990 --> 00:38.117
but unfortunately,
he's also connected

00:38.160 --> 00:40.628
to the ambush and murder
of SIX American operators.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.726
General Hakan.BELDING: You want to go
after Salim Hakan,

00:42.780 --> 00:44.509
you can't be even
a little bit wrong.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.380
The old men will bury you.

00:46.430 --> 00:48.864
JASON: Permaz Hakan. How'd it go
in there with his wife?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.734
targeting Echo Team,
in particular,

00:51.790 --> 00:53.951
but she does claim to know
that he's targeted

00:54.010 --> 00:54.999
Americans in the past.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.870
Your pride has
made you careless.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.480
Nobody would be surprised
if a pretty, American girl

00:59.530 --> 01:01.964
was found dead
in this part of town.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.533
Any chance this isn't
what I think it is?

02:32.580 --> 02:34.400
Depends.
What do you think it is?

02:34.450 --> 02:37.749
I think it's a target package
for General Salim Hakan,

02:37.800 --> 02:40.155
Police Commander
of Nangarhar Provmce,

02:40.200 --> 02:42.191
hero of Afghanistan,

02:42.240 --> 02:44.196
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.764
Tell the truth.
You made that last part up.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.206
In that case, no.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.206
There's no chance it's
not what you think it is.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.899
Mandy.
300 pages,

02:53.950 --> 02:55.906
four flowcharts and two maps

02:55.950 --> 02:59.078
demonstrating Salim Hakan's
ownership of the poppy farm

02:59.130 --> 03:00.904
and his connection _to
the money that paid

03:00.960 --> 03:02.518
for the hit on Echo Team.

03:02.570 --> 03:04.435
There's also a digital recording
of him threatening the life

03:04.480 --> 03:06.789
of a duly-sworn American
intelligence officer.

03:06.830 --> 03:09.003
You.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.999
This is the target package.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.051
Command is free to turn it down.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.499
Just better hope they never
have to defend that

03:16.540 --> 03:18.019
to an oversight committee.

03:18.060 --> 03:21.530
[sighs]
They're not gonna be too happy.

03:21.590 --> 03:24.718
Be forced to admit the guy
they just publicly bet on

03:24.760 --> 03:27.763
as the way forward here turns
out to be killing Americans.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.243
Instead of just selling us out

03:29.290 --> 03:31.542
like the guys
they usually bet on?

03:31.600 --> 03:36.162
It's gonna make a whole lot of
people look a whole lot of bad.

03:36.210 --> 03:39.122
Figure they ought to be used
to that by now.

03:39.170 --> 03:43.129
You're sure of all of this?

03:43.170 --> 03:44.910
Completely.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.914
Okay. I'll make the call.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.040
Stand by.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.351
And, Mandy.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.789
Yeah, I know. Great work.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.353
You're a pain in my ass.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.452
Morning, sunshine.What do you mean,
"Morning, sunshine"?

04:04.500 --> 04:05.933
It's 5:00 in the afternoon.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.845
Ah, you know what I mean.
Glad you could make it today.

04:07.890 --> 04:09.232
You're looking a little light
on your feet.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.848
Light on my feet.
I'm not light on my feet, Ray.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.413
Morning, everybody.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.859
See? She gets it.Good morning.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.334
First things first,
as of a few hours ago,

04:16.380 --> 04:17.893
the target package
on Salim Hakan

04:17.950 --> 04:19.167
is officially in the pipeline.

04:19.210 --> 04:21.724
Yeah.
[whoops]DAVIS: Well done, well done.

04:21.780 --> 04:23.771
Hey, what did, uh, Belding say?

04:23.820 --> 04:25.469
I'm sure you can imagine.Oh, I'm imagining,
all right.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.511
I'm imagining the whole thing
right now.

04:27.570 --> 04:29.435
Anyway, he passed it
up the chain.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.914
But keep in mind,

04:31.960 --> 04:34.485
it took over 200 days to get
approval for the Bin Laden op.

04:34.530 --> 04:36.873
Salim Hakan's been
ingratiating himself

04:36.920 --> 04:39.309
with American brass
for years now,

04:39.360 --> 04:41.351
so we may be waiting
on a green light for a while.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.833
How the hell is it I ended up
in such a bureaucracy?

04:43.890 --> 04:46.051
So, nothing to do
but wait, wait, wait.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.327
ERIC:
Yeah, something tells me

04:47.370 --> 04:48.974
we'll find a way to keep busy.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.806
Delegation of congressmen
and DoD officials

04:50.850 --> 04:52.363
arriving in J-Bad tonight.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.580
Part of a publicity tour

04:53.640 --> 04:55.540
highlighting infrastructure
improvements

04:55.590 --> 04:58.286
and growing stabilization
in the region.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.331
Okay. Wait for it.
Don't tell me.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.553
Yeah.
[laughs]Hey, Blackburn, please.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.249
Give me a buzzkill.We will be doing security.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.336
RAY:
Ah, come on, man.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.164
Keep them from getting
blown all to hell

05:08.220 --> 05:09.903
in the middle of this
stabilizing region.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.302
Yeah, that would be
embarrassing.

05:11.350 --> 05:13.124
Well, the delegation
is scheduled

05:13.180 --> 05:14.431
to visit _
Forogh Curatlve Hospital,

05:14.480 --> 05:16.004
Downtown Jalalabad.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.301
What time do
they touch down?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.349
DAVIS: I'm gonna meet
them at the airfield,

05:18.400 --> 05:20.049
bring them back here
to meet you all,

05:20.100 --> 05:21.783
and then show them
to their quarters.SONNY: Any chance this group

05:21.840 --> 05:23.705
is better than the last group
we had to babysit?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.536
You really think politicians
get successful

05:25.580 --> 05:27.275
by listening to people?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.185
No.
Nope.

05:45.690 --> 05:46.941
Oh, this guy.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.867
What, you know him?

05:48.910 --> 05:50.423
I know of him.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.865
Anybody know where
I can get a gun?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.342
JASON:
Was that bad?

05:57.400 --> 06:00.392
[groans]
Commander Blackburn.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.611
General Cook.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.480
Ms. Ellis.Nice to see you again, sir.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.918
And you must be...

06:04.970 --> 06:06.221
Master Chief Hayes, sir.

06:06.270 --> 06:08.352
I was gonna say the
stubborn son of a bitch

06:08.410 --> 06:10.708
who almost got himself stranded
in that house in Yemen.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.625
Right, something
like that, sir.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.321
That was a tough op.
Yeah.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.418
Good to know we're
in such capable hands.
Yes.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.416
Gentlemen.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.596
Secretary Benjamin Reed.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.631
Master Chief Hayes, sir.How you doing?

06:27.690 --> 06:28.759
Welcome.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.776
This here is, uh,

06:30.820 --> 06:32.868
Bravo Team.
We're here to keep you safe.

06:32.910 --> 06:34.901
Hope you make that
easier than it sounds.

06:34.950 --> 06:36.998
Driving around in
an armored convoy in J-Bad

06:37.040 --> 06:38.439
isn't exactly inconspicuous,
sir.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.993
JASON: Ah, it's like
wearing Mets gear

06:40.050 --> 06:41.347
to a Phillies game.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.879
Crimson to the Yale Bowl.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.875
Right.
[chuckles]

06:43.920 --> 06:45.262
Something like that.

06:45.310 --> 06:48.438
Okay. Um, so, we'll keep it
real simple.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.741
You're not in Washington
anymore.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.744
You're in a war zone.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.188
Follow our instructions.

06:52.230 --> 06:53.276
If you don't,
you're gonna get killed.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.447
ERIC:
All right, well,

06:55.500 --> 06:56.626
gentlemen, if you'll follow me,

06:56.670 --> 06:57.796
I'll show you
to your accommodations.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.318
Good. Thank you.

07:00.370 --> 07:02.452
After you.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.058
What time do we leave
In the morning?

07:04.110 --> 07:05.418
We got to be at the
hospital by 0900,

07:05.460 --> 07:07.633
so I figure we take
off around 0730.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.159
Okay.First time in a while

07:09.210 --> 07:11.246
you guys aren't gonna be
working reverse schedule.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.722
Yeah, you know what?

07:12.780 --> 07:14.111
You guys want to make the most
of this, uh, night off?

07:14.170 --> 07:15.649
I can get us
some adult beverages.

07:15.690 --> 07:18.124
Bring 'em back here after
I get our guests tucked in.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.297
That is, unless you'd
rather just have a rest.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.124
JASON:
Nah, we're good.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.169
[laughter]

07:23.220 --> 07:24.528
I'm out.
JASON:
Why are you out?

07:24.570 --> 07:25.878
You're always out.
SONNY:
Hooch it up.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.525
What do you mean you're out?
Let's get the hooch.

07:28.570 --> 07:30.652
Oh, shake it.
Shake it, shake it, man.CLAY: All right, all right.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.359
_SONNY:
All right, let's go.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.742
Here we go.Sonny's toilet hooch.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.404
Now, Davis, if I
make this right here,

07:35.450 --> 07:37.441
you're gonna settle
my stripper tab.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.491
[laughter]
Oh, oh.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.586
All right, no, no,
hold on, hold on.
Okay.

07:40.630 --> 07:41.585
Okay.
Okay.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.541
You miss this...
Yes.

07:43.590 --> 07:46.286
...and you have to ride
with the suits tomorrow.CLAY: Don't do it, Sonny.

07:46.330 --> 07:47.718
That's a terrible bet for you.
Don't do it.
Bad one.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.670
I got this under control.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.813
No look. With a no look. Ready?

07:52.860 --> 07:54.555
[all yelling]

07:54.600 --> 07:56.113
SONNY:
Come on!

07:56.170 --> 07:57.558
DAVIS:
Sonny, my love,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.421
you just enjoy that ride
with Congressman Chicken Hawk

08:00.480 --> 08:02.516
all day tomorrow.[laughing]:
Congressman Chicken Hawk?

08:02.560 --> 08:05.256
I'll show him where to tie
his little, yellow ribbon.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.870
RAY: Boss, doesn't it
strike you as odd that a guy

08:07.920 --> 08:09.399
who spends so much
time and energy

08:09.440 --> 08:10.782
hating our elected officials

08:10.830 --> 08:12.786
doesn't take the time
to vote for anyone else?

08:12.840 --> 08:13.784
Wait, time-out,
time-out.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.909
You don't,
you don't vote?

08:14.970 --> 08:16.790
JASON: No, no,
he doesn't believe in that

08:16.840 --> 08:17.829
political rhetoric, right?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.222
SONNY:
Correction.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.793
It is a privilege to vote,

08:20.840 --> 08:23.365
and a soldier should
be apolitical.

08:23.410 --> 08:24.490
CLAY: Apolitica|?All right, here we go.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.144
Do you even know
what "apolitical" means?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.588
[laughter]

08:27.630 --> 08:29.803
SONNY:
I hate Alper

08:29.850 --> 08:32.318
because he uses the military
as a talking point,

08:32.380 --> 08:35.156
not because of the color
of his tie.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.020
Now, I-I've served
under three presidents,

08:38.080 --> 08:42.460
never knowing who my next boss
is gonna be.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.250
It's better not to care.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.434
Hmm.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.731
[whistles]

08:49.790 --> 08:53.567
Unfortunately,
break time's over. TOC in one.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.611
Oh.There's no way the Salim package
got approved that quick.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.708
Yeah, unless Mandy got in there
and worked some magic.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.742
Let's go find out
what she wants.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.574
Burn it out, boys.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.229
Uptick in chatter.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.326
MANDY:
Yes.

09:08.370 --> 09:10.588
"Chatter" like talk?
Yes.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.633
So, basically, all the people
you have under surveillance

09:13.680 --> 09:15.932
around here start texting,
talking, e-mailing each other

09:15.990 --> 09:18.117
more than usual,
and that's alarming enough

09:18.160 --> 09:19.411
to cut short our night off?

09:19.470 --> 09:21.153
What's alarming isn't
that they're talking.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.461
It's what they're
talking about.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.159
Rumor going around that
somebody's planning

09:24.210 --> 09:25.814
to hit the congressional
delegation.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.878
I feel like I already know
the answer to this question,

09:38.920 --> 09:41.138
but any chance
that the brass see fit

09:41.180 --> 09:44.001
to cancel this
dog and pony show?

09:44.060 --> 09:46.187
The point of this tour is
to prove progress in the region.

09:46.230 --> 09:47.629
Safety.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.626
Canceling at the last minute
because of a threat...

09:49.670 --> 09:51.661
It's not exactly the figure
that Command wants to cut.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.620
CLAY: I suppose if safety
were a chief concern,

09:53.680 --> 09:56.547
then they'd just do a photo op
here at the base.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.501
You can't tell us anything more
what we're up against?

09:58.550 --> 10:00.279
We're working on it.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.241
JASON:
All right, Ray.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.633
What are we working on?[sighs] Well, uh, convoy's
especially vulnerable

10:04.690 --> 10:06.635
to an RPG hit.
Yeah.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.248
Or a car bomb.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.688
Damn shame most of the
roads in this country

10:09.730 --> 10:11.288
can't accommodate
tactical speed.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.602
We're just gonna have
to move as fast

10:12.650 --> 10:14.038
as the roads _
can accommodate, right?

10:14.090 --> 10:15.079
That takes care of transport.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.609
What about after
we're dismounted?

10:16.650 --> 10:17.787
DAVIS: Well, the hospital's
in the middle of the city,

10:17.830 --> 10:20.298
so it's _accessible
by multiple streets.

10:20.350 --> 10:21.829
What if the bad guys
decide to put somebody

10:21.880 --> 10:24.656
in the crowd
with an S-vest?Or a few somebodies.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.964
Yeah.Yeah, I mean we know
that these protectees

10:28.010 --> 10:30.228
are gonna insist
on working that crowd.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.578
Ugh, a politician is not gonna
miss a chance to pose

10:32.630 --> 10:34.530
with all those photogenic,
sympathetic Afghan kids.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.103
Yup.
JASON: Yeah, okay,
so when do we

10:36.150 --> 10:37.708
get advance work at the venue?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.842
I'm still trying to coordinate
with the battle space owner now.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.504
So, no advance work
is what you're saying?

10:41.550 --> 10:44.371
Yeah, I'm saying the battle
space owner's an Army colonel.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.672
Doesn't exactly answer to me.JASON: Okay.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.595
You _know what we could do
IS just screen the crowd.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.857
Anyone who gets close
to the delegation,

10:49.910 --> 10:51.298
you know what
they have to do?

10:51.340 --> 10:54.901
They got to pass by the
Hair Missile here, right?

10:54.950 --> 10:56.292
Get a good sniff.

10:56.350 --> 11:00.047
Ah. [laughs] Right?
Get a good sniff going here.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.173
Hey, how's, uh, Stella holding
up with the first deployment?

11:07.230 --> 11:09.130
[chuckles]
Uh, she's good.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.488
She's, you know, keeping
busy becoming an expert

11:11.540 --> 11:12.700
on all things
Afghanistan.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.662
Well, busy's good, I guess.Yeah.

11:15.710 --> 11:16.927
I mean, every time
I think about, like,

11:16.980 --> 11:17.924
trying to put myself
in their shoes, it's...

11:17.980 --> 11:19.663
it's weird. Right?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.449
Yeah, but I mean,
at least Danny's, like,

11:21.500 --> 11:23.024
been over here,
you know, he knows

11:23.070 --> 11:24.799
the whole deal and everything.
That's got to help, right?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.193
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but
you're okay, right?

11:28.680 --> 11:31.729
Honestly, I'm, uh...

11:31.770 --> 11:35.035
I'm not really sure where
Stella's head's at right now.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.593
She's been spending
a lot of time

11:36.650 --> 11:37.947
with this guy
she works for, Gordon.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.082
[quietly]:
Sorry.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.643
Why are you laughing?I'm s...

11:41.700 --> 11:44.737
You're worried about
a guy named Gordon, Clay?

11:44.790 --> 11:47.429
[chuckles]

11:47.480 --> 11:49.436
Come on, now,
Stella adores you.

11:49.490 --> 11:51.708
You think I'm being paranoid?Yes.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.877
But also no.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.615
My Gordon
is named Tiffany.

11:56.670 --> 11:59.093
Danny's
physical therapist.

11:59.150 --> 12:03.063
In my brain she's, like,
six feet tall, abs for days.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.759
Yes, keep going.

12:04.810 --> 12:07.495
Shut up. You're stupid.Way to go, Danny, huh.

12:07.550 --> 12:10.542
[sighs]

12:10.590 --> 12:11.636
It's messed up, isn't it?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.375
What long distance
can do to your head.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.206
Yeah. Yes.

12:15.250 --> 12:19.903
Hey, you ever see, uh,
Strangers on a Train?

12:19.950 --> 12:22.771
Yeah, sure. Psycho offers
to kill a guy's wife

12:22.820 --> 12:24.162
if the guy kills
the psycho's dad.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.639
Yeah, I'm not-not sure

12:27.700 --> 12:29.861
I'm at the whole
"murder Gordon" phase yet.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.740
No, but you're
curious.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.008
And if you do a Internet
deep dive on Gordon,

12:34.050 --> 12:36.655
that would be
weird, right?

12:36.710 --> 12:38.575
Serious s_talker
behaVIor.

12:38.620 --> 12:41.748
But if I look into Gordon,
you look into Tiffany.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.496
I mean, that... think that
would just be two friends

12:44.540 --> 12:46.144
doing each other a solid.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.805
We're not stalkers.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.715
No.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.716
Okay. Bye.
All right.
See you later. Bye.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.152
'Sup, Doc?

12:58.210 --> 12:59.859
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.209
I got to say it was a trip
getting your message.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.206
Yeah.Who would've thought, J-Bad.
You and me, huh?

13:04.260 --> 13:05.682
Well, how the hell are you?Good.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.517
Thanks. Hey, last time I saw
you, you were, what, uh,

13:09.570 --> 13:11.868
scrubbing VX out of my hair
in, uh, al-Hool.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.342
Right?
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.436
Actually, it turns out
a lot of the ISIS guys

13:15.490 --> 13:17.833
we kicked out of Syria, they're
just coming here to regroup.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.700
So, Agency's worried
they're gonna start

13:19.750 --> 13:21.832
with chemical weapons again.
Therefore... [pops]

13:21.880 --> 13:23.142
Hey, you want to grab a beer?

13:23.190 --> 13:24.839
Yeah, maybe later,
we'll definitely do that.

13:24.890 --> 13:26.835
Listen, can you
keep a secret?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.232
Uh... yeah, sure.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.236
All right, listen, this,
um, this drill bit--

13:30.280 --> 13:32.669
buddy of mine using
it to poke around

13:32.720 --> 13:34.676
the old irrigation
tunnels around here.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.029
You know, he thought he found
something-- I don't know what--

13:37.070 --> 13:39.459
but, uh, as you can see,
there's some residual

13:39.510 --> 13:42.855
on there. I just thought maybe
you could find out what that is.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.162
You think it's a chem-bio agent?

13:44.210 --> 13:45.768
No, I don't think it's
anything like that.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.720
Yeah, well, there's
definitely enough residual.

13:47.780 --> 13:50.772
You know, uh, what kind of field
those tunnels were irrigating?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.559
Yeah, poppies.

13:52.610 --> 13:55.340
Okay. Well, I could
take a sample,

13:57.090 --> 13:59.399
but if you really want to know
what's on this thing,

13:59.440 --> 14:02.136
I got to send that out
to our lab in Germany.

14:02.180 --> 14:03.875
Can you keep that quiet?Sure.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.444
I mean, the kind of stuff I
usually send those guys to test,

14:06.490 --> 14:08.708
if it doesn't have the potential
to wipe out Western Europe,

14:08.760 --> 14:10.148
it ain't gonna really
raise their pulses anyway.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.532
That's great. Let me
know what you find.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.195
We'll get that beer
later on, okay?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.844
What's a favor between
two jump buddies, right?That's right.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.846
My man!Yeah, my man.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.846
MAN:
How's it looking?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.936
MAN 2:
Looks good...

14:23.640 --> 14:27.110
Derek, Franklin and Full Metal
will be your drivers.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.421
Lead Hummer--
Ray, Brock,

14:28.470 --> 14:30.290
and the pup. Trail Hummer--
Clay and Trent.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.604
Everyone else will be in
the MRAP with the protectees.

14:32.650 --> 14:34.868
Any chance that seating chart
slipped your mind?

14:34.910 --> 14:36.252
Bet's a bet, sucker.Ooh!

14:36.310 --> 14:37.823
JASON: Bet's a bet.Ugh, this sucks.

14:37.870 --> 14:38.859
Okay, let's go. Let's do this.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.399
See you on the
other side, brother.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.919
Damn straight, man.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.918
Okay. It's a good day
for a picnic, isn't it?

14:44.970 --> 14:48.053
Ah, damn, I'm working.Ah, so am I.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.887
No other updates you can give me
on what we're heading into here?

14:50.930 --> 14:53.490
We're rattling our assets,
but nothing yet.

14:53.540 --> 14:54.757
You all set otherwise?Yeah.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.279
I'm ready to roll.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.718
Just hoping that
these politicians

14:57.760 --> 14:59.068
don't show up,
that's all.

14:59.110 --> 15:00.805
Morning again, sir.Good to see you, sir.

15:00.850 --> 15:02.329
Morning, sir. Welcome.Good to see you.

15:02.370 --> 15:05.589
Sorry to disappoint.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.767
Is all of our body armor
this heaw?

15:07.810 --> 15:09.425
DAVIS: Well, only
the good stuff, sir.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.119
Only the good stuff.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.159
Okay, obviously
we're all aware

15:12.210 --> 15:13.814
of the uptick
in chatter, correct?

15:13.860 --> 15:16.818
Obviously. Can I assume we're
taking appropriate precautions?

15:16.870 --> 15:19.338
Yeah, we're doing
the best we can, sir.
Yeah.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.950
The most important security
measures remain the same--

15:22.000 --> 15:23.217
follow our instructions.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.430
You say jump,

15:24.480 --> 15:25.879
we say how high.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.262
How about I say jump
and you jump?

15:29.180 --> 15:31.876
ERIC: It may sound
a little overprotective,

15:31.930 --> 15:34.615
but, uh, this is all
in your best interest.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.968
Certainly, gentlemen.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.887
I hereby put myself
in your capable hands.

15:39.930 --> 15:40.976
We appreciate
that, sir.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.840
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:42.890 --> 15:45.154
go ahead and try to get
this show on the road.Yeah, yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.929
Of course, Eric, uh,
we'll move out as soon

15:46.980 --> 15:48.936
as we have the final_ member
of our delegation.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.979
Yeah, we weren't informed of...

15:53.030 --> 15:56.249
Uh, he's a last-minute addition.
He should be along any...

15:56.300 --> 15:59.940
[chuckles] As a matter of fact,
that's him now.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.921
I assume you know
General Salim Hakan,

16:14.970 --> 16:16.267
the commander
of the National Police

16:16.320 --> 16:17.969
for Nangarhar Province.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.799
We've met.

16:28.030 --> 16:31.545
Sir.
[groans]

16:31.590 --> 16:33.899
Yes, sir.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.635
Yeah.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.294
Of course, sir.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.900
What do you mean? You're really
gonna let this guy roll with us?

16:39.950 --> 16:41.815
It gets better
than that.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.031
Alper invited him
to ride in our MRAP.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.957
Bodyguards will bring up
the rear in their Technical.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.479
You got to
be kidding me.
I wish.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.566
Comes straight
from Command.

16:49.610 --> 16:50.861
Did you tell Command to look

16:50.920 --> 16:52.137
at the target package
awaiting their approval?

16:52.180 --> 16:54.045
It says clearly that he
is likely responsible

16:54.100 --> 16:55.431
for the death of Echo Team.

16:55.490 --> 16:57.003
Yeah, you're preaching
to the choir.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.053
Okay, well, the good news is,
Salim's not an ideologue.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.056
He's unlikely to bomb
a convoy he's riding in.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.921
Right, well, the bad news is,
I got to look at this guy's face

17:04.980 --> 17:06.493
without putting
a bullet in it.

17:06.540 --> 17:09.100
How long you figure it'd take
to get my, uh, kit out here?

17:09.150 --> 17:11.459
Two minutes.
JASON: Wow.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.968
You really gonna come along just
so, what, you can hold my leash?

17:14.030 --> 17:16.897
No. I'm gonna come along
to hold Sonny's leash, too.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.369
Kit's on its way.
All right, done.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.035
Let's get loaded up, guys.Let's go, gentlemen.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.080
SALIM: Do you know a quarter
of the women in your military

17:34.140 --> 17:35.823
have been assaulted by
men they serve with?

17:40.450 --> 17:42.668
You're very brave to
live on this base.

17:42.710 --> 17:44.484
What do you want?

17:44.540 --> 17:47.532
To apologize.
Really?

17:47.580 --> 17:52.108
The last time we spoke,
I was upset and-and angry.

17:52.150 --> 17:54.937
I fear the subject of my
wife is not a happy one.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.505
Yeah, she told me some
pretty nasty things about you.

17:57.550 --> 18:00.110
The man she describes
is who I was.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.072
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.769
We're all products
of our environment.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.299
I hope you won't
hold mine against me.

18:09.340 --> 18:12.389
Your environment's
not the problem.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.957
Have a good day, Miss Ellis.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.228
I hope you'll be safe here.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.258
Okay, look, I'm sure
you all know the drill.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.734
You'll stay in formation,
we keep it tight.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.691
And when we say
move, you move.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.696
The congressman expects
there'll be opportunity

19:01.740 --> 19:04.083
for positive interaction
with the locals.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.562
Except them locals,

19:05.620 --> 19:07.440
they're looking for a
different type of interaction.

19:07.490 --> 19:09.742
Not the positive kind.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.098
ALPER: Well, the whole point of
these events is to demonstrate

19:12.150 --> 19:15.108
a cooperative interaction
with our Afghan partners.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.459
SALIM: And, of course,
to give us the chance

19:17.500 --> 19:18.626
to display our gratitude.

19:22.070 --> 19:25.119
You know what,
the whole point of this

19:25.160 --> 19:26.548
is for us to keep you safe

19:26.600 --> 19:28.204
and alive.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.854
Well, surely
there's a way we can

19:29.900 --> 19:31.117
work all this out.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.207
Obviously we'll do our best
to accommodate.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.069
All we ask.

19:36.130 --> 19:39.293
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
How close are we?

19:39.350 --> 19:41.341
DAVIS:
The hospital's
eight blocks away.

19:41.390 --> 19:42.789
ETA-- two minutes.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.219
Bravo 2, sitrep?

19:45.270 --> 19:46.999
All good, Bravo 1.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.302
What's the matter? You running
out of small talk in there?

19:49.360 --> 19:51.225
JASON: That's funny.
You just keep that up,

19:51.270 --> 19:52.749
I'll tell you what,
I'll switch you out

19:52.800 --> 19:54.188
with Sonny on the ride home.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.447
All right, I'm done talking.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.139
JASON: Oh, Davis puts us
about two mikes out.

19:57.190 --> 19:59.886
When we arrive,
we want to keep it tight.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.490
Always.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.156
JASON:
TOC.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.111
This is 1. Pulling up now.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.469
Southside entrance.

20:57.950 --> 21:00.032
[indistinct chatter]

21:15.490 --> 21:16.832
MAN:
Congressman Alper.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.393
ALPER:
It's my honor, thank you.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.315
Thank you for everything.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.362
[camera shutters clicking]

21:30.240 --> 21:32.231

[man shouting in Pashto]

21:45.690 --> 21:47.772
[Cerberus barking]

21:49.220 --> 21:50.380
All call signs,
this is Bravo 1, abort.

21:50.430 --> 21:51.431
Move, move, move!

21:56.400 --> 21:58.004
What the hell are you doing?

21:59.270 --> 22:00.874
Clear!

22:00.920 --> 22:03.138
[shouting, Cerberus barking]

22:03.190 --> 22:04.873
[man speaking Pashto]

22:09.150 --> 22:10.310
What the hell is he saying?

22:11.370 --> 22:12.792
Something about his wife.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.750
[shouting in Pashto]

22:18.420 --> 22:19.717
He says his wife is
a patient here.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.192
She was hit by a bus
or something.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.206
[speaking Pashto]

22:23.250 --> 22:26.549
Well, why the hell you didn't
use the front door, then, huh?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.989
Huh?!

22:29.040 --> 22:31.383
[over comm]:
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.385
Go ahead, 3.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.603
Yeah, he's a private citizen,

22:34.650 --> 22:36.208
and his wife is here
at the hospital.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.865
I'm gonna drop him off
at the local PD.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.172
Copy that.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.040
DAVIS: You know
Congressman Alper is gonna

22:43.100 --> 22:45.000
want to punish someone
for a false alarm.

22:45.050 --> 22:46.483
Wouldn't surprise me.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.316
Never good to make
an enemy of a guy

22:48.360 --> 22:50.146
that's on the committee
that controls your funding.

22:50.190 --> 22:51.407
Be nice if he understood
the guys are

22:51.450 --> 22:52.974
just trying to keep him safe.

22:53.020 --> 22:55.409
Yeah, Alper doesn't strike me
as the understanding type.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.145
Excuse me, this just came in
from the field office in Herat,

22:58.200 --> 23:00.065
near the Iranian border.I know where Herat is.

23:02.030 --> 23:03.418
What's the confidence
level on this?

23:03.460 --> 23:05.280
The sat phone intercept
came from an Iranian

23:05.340 --> 23:06.819
Revolutionary Guard
commander.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.249
Human sources monitoring
the cross-border ratlines

23:09.300 --> 23:10.426
confirm they've heard
the same thing.

23:10.470 --> 23:11.812
Okay, thanks.

23:13.340 --> 23:14.295
What'd they hear?

23:14.340 --> 23:16.422
You ever hear of Abu Ali?

23:16.480 --> 23:18.289
Yeah, it might
ring a bell.

23:18.350 --> 23:19.772
Former Syrian army sniper,

23:19.830 --> 23:21.786
now basically
a contract killer.

23:21.830 --> 23:24.481
Supposed to be the go-to guy for
long-distance assassinations.

23:24.530 --> 23:27.090
His mother must be
so proud.

23:27.140 --> 23:30.359
Aanay, 24 hours ago, Abu Ali
crossed into Afghanistan

23:30.400 --> 23:31.833
from Taybad.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.484
Iranians think he was
headed for Jalalabad.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.889
So, last night we hear
that someone's planning

23:36.930 --> 23:38.795
to hit our congressional
delegation,

23:38.850 --> 23:42.672
and today one of the world's
best assassins turns up in town.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.153
You think that's a coincidence?

23:44.200 --> 23:45.189
I sure as hell hope so.

23:51.990 --> 23:54.641
Our shooter's a Syrian national
known as Abu Ali.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.339
Though not strictly
ideological,

23:56.390 --> 23:58.164
he's an old favorite
ofjihadi groups.

23:58.210 --> 23:59.689
I just sent his file
to your tablet.

23:59.740 --> 24:03.699
Yep, there he is.
Abu Ali, aka Brother Death,

24:03.740 --> 24:05.526
aka Mr. Nobody.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.743
DAVIS:
As you'll see, he made life hell

24:07.790 --> 24:09.178
for the Iraqis in the battle
for West Mosul.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.652
MANDY:
Unfortunately for us,

24:10.710 --> 24:13.099
his range of operations
isn't limited to the Mideast.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.391
Well, he's sure as hell
been racking up

24:14.450 --> 24:16.099
his frequent flyer miles.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.402
We have credible_ intel
he was responsrble

24:18.450 --> 24:19.974
for the murder
of a state legislator

24:20.020 --> 24:21.976
in Northeastern Nigeria
last year.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.102
Then, six weeks ago,
an Azeri journalist

24:24.150 --> 24:26.846
under house arrest was shot
through hIS bedroom wmdow.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.367
Damn, that brother's
ruthless, isn't he?

24:28.420 --> 24:30.149
RAY:
That boy's a cold shot.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.849
JASON:
Now he's in J-Bad.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.856
Yeah. Apparently he's
targeting our delegation.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.458
Cank the tour.
RAY:
Damn straight.

24:35.510 --> 24:37.978
Alper's not gonna like it.JASON:
I don't care about Alper.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.109
I don't care what
he thinks, all right?

24:39.170 --> 24:40.205
You can't protect
against that.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.557
Are you gonna talk to Alper?Yeah.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.998
I'm just saying it's gonna
be tough to make a case

24:43.040 --> 24:44.769
that our intel's reliable
after what just happened.

24:44.830 --> 24:45.865
Fine, I'll talk to Alper.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.047
Hell, we'll all talk to him.

24:47.090 --> 24:48.216
It's not a question of that.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.431
I'll talk to him.
It's my job.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.175
I'm just saying this
is not gonna be easy.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.222
[man shouting in Pashto]

24:54.790 --> 24:56.223
Do you see that?

24:56.270 --> 24:58.056
This thing just happened,

24:58.100 --> 25:00.409
and we already have
25,000...

25:00.450 --> 25:02.793
26.26,000 views.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.580
Thanks to your crack
security squad.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.495
ERIC: Yeah, sir, my men reacted
to what appeared to be

25:06.540 --> 25:08.269
a very imminent threat.Except it wasn't.

25:08.330 --> 25:10.412
And now you come at us with
another "imminent threat."

25:10.460 --> 25:12.189
This sniper.Believe me, sir,

25:12.240 --> 25:13.889
our intelligence
is actionable.

25:13.940 --> 25:16.852
And what if your
intelligence is wrong?Again.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.630
Our intel people have
satellite intercepts

25:19.690 --> 25:21.817
confirmed by human assets.

25:21.860 --> 25:22.986
What, who are these assets?

25:24.520 --> 25:26.033
It's classified.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.605
From the congressman?Yes.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.914
David, individuals
fail in war.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.518
Only teams survive.

25:32.570 --> 25:35.300
If one of our best says cancel,
I think we should listen.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.908
REED: Well, I just hate
to see this crush

25:36.970 --> 25:39.393
our nation-building efforts
we flew 8,000 miles to promote.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.315
'Cause we don't want to do that.
We don't want to crush

25:41.360 --> 25:42.531
the nation's building--Master Chief...

25:42.580 --> 25:43.831
You know what,
they need to hear this, okay?

25:45.580 --> 25:46.535
My experience is
that I trust

25:46.580 --> 25:47.717
Miss Ellis' judgment.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.364
If she says that this
is a real threat,

25:49.410 --> 25:51.230
then all your lives
are in danger.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.544
Well, apologies to my
friend, the secretary,

25:53.590 --> 25:56.150
but we are not here to
nation-build, Master Chief.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.327
We are here to assist
the Afghan people

25:58.380 --> 26:01.599
in their struggle to build
a nation for themselves!

26:01.640 --> 26:04.905
Now, how do we do that
if we turn tail and run?

26:04.950 --> 26:07.339
My job is to keep you safe.
This tour is done, it's over.

26:07.390 --> 26:10.291
Well, I'll absolve you
of that responsibility,

26:10.350 --> 26:11.829
Master Chief.[laughs]

26:11.870 --> 26:13.428
Or, if I lack
the authority

26:13.480 --> 26:16.119
as simply a member of the
House Armed Services committee,

26:16.180 --> 26:19.525
I'm sure my friend here,
General Cook, has a place

26:19.570 --> 26:21.709
in your chain of command.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.362
Afraid we're going
ahead, gentlemen.

26:30.410 --> 26:32.537
Of course, sir.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.535
You're making
a big mistake.

26:34.590 --> 26:37.969
ALPER: Your responsibility is
our protection, Master Chief.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.975
Protect us.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.588
Yes, sir.

26:44.380 --> 26:47.167
[indistinct chatter]

26:47.210 --> 26:49.246
RAY:
These guys ﬁnance the war
that tore these people up,

26:49.300 --> 26:50.995
fund the hospital that
stitches them back together,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.519
then show up to take
selfies with 'em.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.084
Yeah, that's all they want
to do is take selfies.

26:54.130 --> 26:56.030
And we watch their backs
while they do it.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.512
I don't think
about that, Ray.

26:57.570 --> 26:59.128
Yes, you do.
You just can't say it.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.260
That's why you got me.

27:00.310 --> 27:04.394
Bravo 3, Bravo 6,
is it clear upstairs?

27:04.440 --> 27:06.396
Yeah, Bravo 1,
we are clear to move.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.519
JASON:
Copy that.

27:07.580 --> 27:09.138
I'm gonna go put eyes on Salim.

27:09.190 --> 27:10.441
SONNY: You know,
he don't seem like the guy

27:10.490 --> 27:12.492
that would blow us up
riding around with us,

27:12.540 --> 27:16.579
but he sure as hell would
InVIte a sniper to the party

27:16.630 --> 27:18.279
to pick us off.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.366
What are we doing here?
This is a clown show.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.229
We got this.[laughs]

27:22.290 --> 27:25.930
Your optimistic point of view
amazes me sometimes, Spenser.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.718
JASON:
Okay, excuse me, gentlemen.

27:29.770 --> 27:31.556
I think we should keep moving,
get you to the second floor.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.592
It's okay, Master Chief,
there's been a change of plans.

27:34.650 --> 27:35.867
Change of plans?

27:35.910 --> 27:37.992
Washington would
greatly appreciate

27:38.040 --> 27:40.031
the congressman making himself
available to the press.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.864
That's excellent.
And I understand

27:41.920 --> 27:44.002
from the director here
that the hospital courtyard

27:44.050 --> 27:45.950
would be a perfect place
for a few quick words

27:46.010 --> 27:47.739
and some Q & A.That's a bad idea.

27:47.790 --> 27:50.350
Yeah, I'd have to agree.Well, as do I,

27:50.400 --> 27:52.448
but the last thing I
want to do is speechify

27:52.490 --> 27:53.661
when I could spend
my afternoon

27:53.710 --> 27:56.668
with these beautiful
people, but there it is.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.230
Sir, could I have
a word, please?

28:00.280 --> 28:03.750
Excuse us.
What's the issue?

28:03.810 --> 28:05.107
The issue is that
your colleague wants

28:05.160 --> 28:06.843
to change the tactical plan.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.151
Actually, that request came
directly from Washington.Shut up!

28:08.200 --> 28:09.246
Get him out of here, Ray.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.417
It's bad enough
that we are here,

28:11.470 --> 28:12.892
but putting us
in an exposed position,

28:12.950 --> 28:14.167
that's suicidal.

28:14.210 --> 28:15.689
I'll speak with him.

28:17.470 --> 28:19.552
Problem?

28:20.960 --> 28:23.520
JASON:
Nothing we can't handle.

28:23.570 --> 28:26.789
Yes, I'm sure you're adept
at protecting your people.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.876
That I know.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.002
[indistinct chatter]

28:30.050 --> 28:31.529
You have no idea.

28:31.570 --> 28:33.526
Well, if you need
any assistance,

28:33.580 --> 28:34.615
we are happy to help.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.235
[indistinct conversation]

28:41.280 --> 28:44.579
They say real power grows out
from the barrel of a gun.

28:44.630 --> 28:45.756
Apparently not today.

28:45.810 --> 28:48.938
It ain't over yet.

28:48.980 --> 28:51.448
Coming after you next.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.682
JASON [whistles]:
Hey.

28:56.730 --> 29:00.769
Ray.
Listen.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.380
Overwatch, south side.
Got it?

29:03.430 --> 29:06.035
On it.Al| right,
moving up.

29:06.090 --> 29:07.170
All call signs,

29:07.220 --> 29:09.472
we're moving outside,
west corridor.

29:09.530 --> 29:10.781
Bravo 3, copy.

29:10.830 --> 29:15.221
You still optimistic
there, sunshine?

29:15.270 --> 29:17.488
DAVIS: Bravo 1, this is TOC.
What's the situation?

29:17.530 --> 29:18.656
It's not good.

29:18.710 --> 29:20.666
ALPER:
It's determination like that--

29:20.710 --> 29:24.623
like that of our Afghan
partners in the fields

29:24.670 --> 29:26.661
of Helmand
and Kandahar,

29:26.720 --> 29:29.848
of our own_
courageous military

29:29.890 --> 29:31.892
in the great mountains
to the east,

29:35.030 --> 29:39.410
and says yes,
Afghanistan is worth it.

29:39.470 --> 29:42.644
Now, some have questioned

29:42.690 --> 29:44.817
our policy of engagement here.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.862
Is Afghanistan really worth it?

29:47.910 --> 29:52.609
Can this great country, made up
of so many proud peoples,

29:52.660 --> 29:54.878
ever be made whole again?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.399
Bravo 2, anything?

29:56.440 --> 29:57.828
ALPER: When I spoke
with the president...

29:57.880 --> 30:00.314
RAY: Still quiet up here....the other day in Kabul,

30:00.360 --> 30:01.964
he told me of a young...

30:02.010 --> 30:04.092
RAY: If he's in there somewhere,
I can't see him.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.708
And I can see a lot.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.489
Might have dodged
this one, brother.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.495
Keep your eyes open.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.495
Copy that.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.189
TOC, you got anything?

30:11.240 --> 30:14.289
The security cordon's holding.

30:14.330 --> 30:15.672
There's no vehicular traffic
within 200 yards

30:15.720 --> 30:17.278
of your perimeter.

30:17.330 --> 30:18.285
Just let me know
if anything changes.

30:18.330 --> 30:21.333
Will do.Bravo 6?

30:21.380 --> 30:22.688
No, still nothing.

30:22.730 --> 30:23.765
Copy.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.855
ALPER:
...it was a raw deal of fate

30:24.910 --> 30:26.514
that was handed to him.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.074
He stood up to that...

30:29.130 --> 30:30.472
Bravo 1, back right.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.078
Guy in a maroon outfit
moving towards the center.

30:35.050 --> 30:38.736
Got him. Bravo 3?Yeah, I see him, too.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.007
ALPER:
Now, those were the words,

30:40.050 --> 30:43.042
the simple words of a boy...

30:43.100 --> 30:44.226
He's reaching in his pocket.

30:44.270 --> 30:45.578
Don't do it, man.

30:45.620 --> 30:49.704
[Alper continues indistinctly]

30:51.110 --> 30:55.228
ALPER: Now, this project
of ours, of all of us...

30:55.280 --> 30:56.622
Maroon outfit's not a threat.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.329
Say again, maroon outfit's
not a threat.

30:58.370 --> 30:59.803
He's taking a photo.

30:59.850 --> 31:01.545
_ _ALPER:
So it's With great pleasure

31:01.590 --> 31:03.319
that I introduce
one of those partners

31:03.380 --> 31:04.802
right here in Jalalabad.

31:04.860 --> 31:06.680
His command has been
essential to...

31:06.730 --> 31:08.630
Bravo 2, you got eyes
on the building across from us?

31:08.690 --> 31:10.772
Above the roofline?

31:10.820 --> 31:13.687
ALPER:
Police Commander Salim Hakan.

31:13.740 --> 31:14.991
[applause]

31:15.040 --> 31:17.258
[both speak indistinctly]

31:19.000 --> 31:20.479
RAY:
That's him, Bravo 1.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.599
Gun at two o'clock.

31:21.660 --> 31:24.697
[gunfire, panicked shouts]

31:34.630 --> 31:35.790
Go, go, go. Move, move, move.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.010
Get these guys
back to convoy.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.493
Four of you with me.What are you gonna do?

31:38.540 --> 31:40.269
REiY'S got eyes on the sniper--
WE're gonna take him out.

31:40.330 --> 31:41.979
Our mission is to get this
guy back in one piece.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.590
Then what are you
still doing here? Go, go, go!Roger that.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.768
2, this is 1.
Heading up with 4.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.946
[vehicle rumbling,
siren wailing]

31:52.990 --> 31:55.379
He's on that roof somewhere.
I don't have a clear shot.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.124
He's on the move.

31:58.170 --> 31:59.990
Don't let him out of your sight.

32:00.040 --> 32:03.430
Copy that.I got the bird's-eye on him.
Go, go get that son of a bitch.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.950
[alarm blaring]

32:09.920 --> 32:13.003
Can you feel anything?
You got, you got any pain?

32:13.060 --> 32:14.925
No. Nothing. No.Nothing.

32:14.970 --> 32:17.097
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

32:17.150 --> 32:19.141
We've searched these guys
multiple times,

32:19.190 --> 32:22.887
and all we can find
is some road rash.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.238
Who the hell's blood is this?

32:25.290 --> 32:26.848
NEWSMAN: The shooting seems
to have stopped.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.845
It's unclear who among
the targeted American delegation

32:28.900 --> 32:31.061
has been injured, but it does
appear a number of bystanders

32:31.120 --> 32:32.109
have been shot...

32:32.160 --> 32:34.685
That's Salim Hakan.

32:34.730 --> 32:38.166
[newsman continues indistinctly]

33:14.940 --> 33:17.465
[grunts in pain]

33:17.510 --> 33:19.853
Bravo 1, Bravo 2, this is
Zero-One-- I got the sniper

33:19.910 --> 33:22.720
on the rooftop of the building
southwest of the courtyard.

33:22.780 --> 33:24.736
He's battened down the hatches,
but he is there.

33:32.790 --> 33:35.964
JASON: Zero-One,
looking at roof in question.

33:36.010 --> 33:37.830
There's only one or two places
he can be.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.189
Bravo 1, this is 2,
taking up position opposite roof

33:40.230 --> 33:41.663
to your location.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.310
Bravo 2, you got eyes?

33:48.110 --> 33:50.328
Negaﬁve.
You got the best angle.

33:50.370 --> 33:52.361
Anything?

33:57.030 --> 33:58.065
Nothing.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.815
ERIC:
Bravo 1, Bravo 2,

33:59.860 --> 34:00.815
this is Zero-One.

34:00.860 --> 34:02.680
I have all y'all on ISR.

34:02.730 --> 34:05.164
He's in the northern enclosure.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.604
Bravo 2, frag him.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.561
Drop it in there.On it.

34:14.050 --> 34:14.994
[grunts in pain]

34:24.010 --> 34:25.568
Target down.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.497
JASON:
Is everyone okay?

34:30.540 --> 34:32.189
[groans]

34:33.850 --> 34:36.159
Bravo 2, you okay?

34:37.200 --> 34:38.974
[grunting]

34:39.030 --> 34:40.509
Rogen

34:40.550 --> 34:42.370
I'm good.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.345
He's got a phone.

34:59.740 --> 35:02.561
[camera clicking]JASON:
All right.

35:15.890 --> 35:17.323
How they doing?
They good?

35:17.370 --> 35:19.543
The other two are still
getting some tests,

35:19.590 --> 35:21.581
but it seems like just
a couple scrapes.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.541
Probably some mental
scars to contend with.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.636
Should be good, huh?

35:30.170 --> 35:31.387
We got some

35:31.430 --> 35:32.681
real wounded warriors
now, huh?

35:32.730 --> 35:34.038
This could have been
far worse.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.162
If your reflexes
were any slower,

35:36.220 --> 35:38.996
I'd be on a slab downstairs
with General Hakan.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.519
So thank you,
gentlemen.

35:40.570 --> 35:42.083
Just doing our job, sir.[sighs]

35:42.140 --> 35:45.041
ALPER:
Edward, put together
a press release.

35:45.090 --> 35:47.172
I want to assure the public...

35:47.230 --> 35:49.619
Go ahead, say it.What?

35:49.660 --> 35:51.616
Whatever is making you
look like you're trying

35:51.670 --> 35:54.230
to walk forward
with your pants on backwards.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.702
Saying I look
discombobulated?

35:55.760 --> 35:57.102
Yeah, something like that.

35:57.150 --> 35:58.845
[sighs]

36:00.020 --> 36:02.159
This isn't how I wanted
to get Salim.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.361
I get it. I know you wanted
to bring him in yourself.

36:04.420 --> 36:05.762
But you know what?
We got him.

36:05.810 --> 36:06.765
Somebody got him.

36:06.810 --> 36:08.334
The point is, he's got.

36:08.380 --> 36:12.111
Call it karma, fate, whatever
it is, but a get's a get,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.070
and a win is a win.Yeah, I guess.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.816
Okay. So, why don't you go get
some sleep? You deserve it.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.861
All right? Yeah.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.839
[music playing,
indistinct chatter]

36:40.240 --> 36:42.401
Just, uh, just thought
you should know,

36:42.460 --> 36:44.883
you've got nothing
to worry about.

36:44.940 --> 36:47.238
How's that?

36:47.290 --> 36:49.099
Tiffany.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.799
Danny's, uh,
his physical therapist.

36:51.860 --> 36:54.328
You mean with all that's
g0ing on, you had time
to look into her?

36:54.380 --> 36:56.848
Come_ on. You-You're
gonna Sit here and tell me

36:56.910 --> 36:59.333
you didn't do
the old deep dive on Gordon?

36:59.390 --> 37:00.903
So...

37:00.950 --> 37:03.339
do I have anything to worry
about with the professor?

37:03.390 --> 37:06.211
No. I mean, I got his...
his bio right here.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.260
Old fossil time?

37:09.310 --> 37:11.699
Yeah, I mean, look...

37:11.750 --> 37:15.174
the poor guy didn't even have a
chance with a girl like Stella.

37:15.230 --> 37:17.130
Well, good.
I wasn't even worried.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.441
Oh, me neither.

37:18.490 --> 37:19.707
Okay.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.399
Okay. Bye.All right.

37:33.510 --> 37:36.070
[sighs, clears throat]

37:38.080 --> 37:39.331
Mm.

37:52.350 --> 37:53.476
[sighs]

37:53.530 --> 37:55.304
[whispers]:
You got to be kidding me.

37:59.230 --> 38:01.790
[phone ringing]

38:20.290 --> 38:22.019
[moaning]

38:23.210 --> 38:25.030
I am so hungry right now.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.559
Starving.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.329
So are you, too?No, you're sitting
on the refrigerator.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.381
No, really?Maybe there's something
that we can get here.

38:30.430 --> 38:32.159
Oh. No.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.381
That is-- no, no--
an emergency...I got a great idea.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.737
You know what, there's
this great steakhouse

38:35.790 --> 38:37.303
right out on Route 58.

38:37.350 --> 38:41.354
I'm telling you, they have
a rib eye, a bone-in,

38:41.400 --> 38:43.311
about this thick--
it's so good.
Huh.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.351
Garlic mashed potatoes?

38:45.410 --> 38:46.798
Onion rings?No.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.569
Yeah.Don't talk to me like that.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.143
[laughs]Mmm...

38:51.280 --> 38:54.363
Is that anywhere near
Jalalabad Airfield?

38:54.410 --> 38:57.288
About 7,000 miles,
give or take.

38:57.330 --> 38:58.285
Ooh...Mm-hmm.

38:58.330 --> 39:00.150
right around the corner.Mm-hmm.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.633
[laughs][whispers]:
Want to go?

39:01.680 --> 39:02.635
Well, I'm ready.You ready?

39:02.680 --> 39:03.760
Yeah.You're not dressed.

39:03.810 --> 39:05.209
I'm just gonna wear this.
It's fine.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.376
It's so hot outside.Yeah.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.421
[phone beeping]Oh, no.

39:08.470 --> 39:10.643
[laughs]
Aah.
Aah.

39:10.690 --> 39:12.169
Oh. No, no.

39:12.210 --> 39:13.381
What?Oh.

39:13.430 --> 39:14.738
No. No.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.385
Look, I would strongly
urge you not to answer that

39:17.440 --> 39:20.261
if it _wasn't a matter_
of national security.It is.

39:24.050 --> 39:25.870
Hey.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.399
You're not resting.
I told you to rest.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.883
You, uh, you
gonna eat that?

39:30.930 --> 39:32.659
Uh...What's going on?

39:32.710 --> 39:35.019
The sniper's phone.
Okay. Mmm.

39:35.060 --> 39:37.369
What? Did you pull
something off that?

39:37.410 --> 39:38.672
I didn't have to.

39:38.720 --> 39:41.632
A text came in after you
picked it off of him.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.638
Well... okay, you're
gonna have to help me out.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.500
My Arabic's a
little rusty there.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.428
"The remainder of your payment
will be ready in 48 hours."

39:49.470 --> 39:51.335
Payment?

39:51.380 --> 39:53.291
Wait, so they think
he's still alive?

39:53.340 --> 39:55.513
And still out there--
but it's more than that.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.425
If this guy's getting paid,

39:57.480 --> 40:00.438
it means he successfully
completed his job.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.471
So they don't care
if he missed the Americans.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.179
He wasn't aiming
at the Americans.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.653
Salim was the target.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.691
There's a lot easier ways
to take out Salim.

40:07.750 --> 40:10.787
Not if you want to make
it look like a mistake.

40:12.970 --> 40:16.315
Yeah. And if it looks like a
mistake, then there's no reason

40:16.370 --> 40:19.533
to look into the person
who wanted him dead.

40:19.590 --> 40:22.491
It means whoever killed Salim
didn't want us digging too deep

40:22.550 --> 40:24.359
into whatever he was doing.

40:24.420 --> 40:27.457
Or looking into who he might
have been working with.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.808
What for?

40:30.860 --> 40:33.328
[sighs]
[softly]:
Mandy.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.590
Wow.
