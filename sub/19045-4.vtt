What the hell is she doing here?

22:11.497 --> 22:14.265
"What the hell
is she doing here?"
Really?

22:14.267 --> 22:17.201
Really.
I'll tell you
what I'm doing here.

22:17.203 --> 22:20.137
You wanna know
what I'm doing here,
shit-for-brains?

22:20.139 --> 22:23.140
I had sex with your dad.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.377
That's right,
I had sex with your father,

22:26.379 --> 22:29.180
because, just like you,
I like my sex old
and ugly.

22:29.182 --> 22:34.719
And with fake hair
on their heads that falls off
when you're having sex with 'em.

22:34.721 --> 22:38.622
It just falls off
because that's what
you do, Dennis Reynolds.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.424
You like to have sex
with old people.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.726
And you said
that you loved me!

22:41.728 --> 22:46.263
You said, "I love you,"
and so I thought,
"Okay, I love you too."

22:46.265 --> 22:49.400
How do you show love?
You go and have sex
with old people.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.036
So that's what I did too!

23:24.002 --> 23:27.371
