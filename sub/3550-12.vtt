IN THE WAKE OF A TRAGEDY,
A DAUGHTER WAS SAFE...

00:06.337 --> 00:09.180
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.
WE OWE YOU EVERYTHING.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.011
ORSON WAS CHANGED...

00:11.011 --> 00:13.714
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
YOUR HUSBAND'S PARALYZED.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.386
AN UNBORN TWIN WAS GONE...

00:15.386 --> 00:17.288
WE LOST THE BABY...

00:17.288 --> 00:20.351
(whispers)
BUT THE OTHER BABY IS FINE.

00:20.351 --> 00:23.294

 KARL DIDN'T MAKE IT.

OH, MY GOD.
 WAS DEAD.

(Mary Alice) A MONTH
AFTER THE DEATH OF KARL MAYER,

00:36.167 --> 00:39.310
HIS FAMILY ASSEMBLED
FOR THE READING OF HIS WILL.

00:39.310 --> 00:44.315
TO EACH, KARL LEFT SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER HIM BY.

00:44.315 --> 00:49.049
TO HIS GREAT AUNT,
HE LEFT A GRAND PIANO.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.184
TO HIS FAVORITE COUSIN,
HE LEFT GOLD CUFF LINKS.

00:53.184 --> 00:58.189
TO HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER,
HE LEFT CASH AND SECURITIES.

00:58.189 --> 00:59.530
BUT KARL MAYER LEFT

00:59.530 --> 01:02.833
HIS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
POSSESSION OF ALL

01:02.833 --> 01:06.497
TO SOMEONE WHO WASN'T EXPECTING
A THING.

01:06.497 --> 01:10.141
"AND FINALLY,
TO MY EX-WIFE, SUSAN MAYER..."

01:10.141 --> 01:12.143
HEY, THAT'S ME.

01:12.143 --> 01:16.177
OH, I-I-I WAS JUST HERE
TO SUPPORT MY DAUGHTER.

SERIOUSLY, I'VE BEEN PLAYING
HANGMAN ON MY PHONE.

RAN A LAW FIRM

WE'RE ABOUT TO GET A DIVORCE.

08:37.548 --> 08:41.121

WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR, RIGHT?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.993
WELL, YES.

08:42.993 --> 08:46.557
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO TO ATONE FOR THIS SIN.

08:46.557 --> 08:49.560
I THINK YOU KNEW IT
BEFORE I WALKED IN THE DOOR.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.133
YOU WANT ME TO BRING ORSON HOME
AND TAKE CARE OF HIM?

08:55.065 --> 08:57.207

THAT I'M NOT SURE

08:59.269 --> 09:01.672
BREE...

09:01.672 --> 09:05.175

I'VE ALWAYS LOVED.

09:05.175 --> 09:09.680
"YOU CANNOT MAKE YOURSELF FEEL
SOMETHING THAT YOU DO NOT FEEL,

DO RIGHT

FROM THE BIBLE.

OTHER BOOKS, YOU KNOW.

DOESN'T HE REALIZE

 TELL ME YOU'RE GOING.
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE THERE.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.750

I ACTUALLY GOTTA PACK.

WHO ATTACKED ME,

10:46.076 --> 10:47.878
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT

10:47.878 --> 10:50.120
BECAUSE OF...

10:50.120 --> 10:53.383
I WAS DEALING
WITH A LOT OF STUFF--

10:53.383 --> 10:56.857
PROBLEMS WITH MY PARENTS,
HAVING TO MOVE AGAIN.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.259
I GOT REALLY LONELY.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.292
AND YEAH,
I GUESS YOU WERE PART OF IT.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.367
I'M BETTER NOW.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.440
GOOD.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.804
LIFE HAS ITS LOW POINTS, AND WE
JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM.

11:13.804 --> 11:17.007
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

11:17.007 --> 11:19.079
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.414
WELL, YOUR TIMING IS IMPECCABLE,

11:24.414 --> 11:28.458
BECAUSE IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT
WE HAVE AN OPENING RIGHT NOW.

11:28.458 --> 11:31.161
YES, WE HEARD,
AND WE'RE SO EXCITED.

11:31.161 --> 11:34.694
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THIS IS
THE BEST PRIVATE SCHOOL IN TOWN.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.097
IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
HOMESCHOOLING JUANITA.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.699
HOW'S THAT BEEN GOING?

11:39.699 --> 11:43.133
IT'S BEEN SO REWARDING SPENDING
TIME WITH MY LITTLE ANGEL.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.877
(chuckles) IT BREAKS MY HEART
TO SEE IT END.

11:46.877 --> 11:48.879
ANYWAY, HERE'S HER LUNCH.
IT'S ALL PACKED.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.011
AND WE'LL PICK HER UP AT 4:00.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.843
UH, W-WAIT--WAIT
JUST A SECOND.

11:52.843 --> 11:57.948
THERE ARE A FEW OTHER FAMILIES
ON THE WAITING LIST BEFORE YOU.

11:57.948 --> 12:01.291
OH, THERE ARE?

12:01.291 --> 12:05.725
YES, BUT SUSAN DELFINO GAVE YOU
SUCH A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.227
AND TO BE QUITE FRANK,

12:07.227 --> 12:10.230
WE COULD USE A LITTLE MORE
DIVERSITY IN THIS SCHOOL.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
IT'S BEEN QUITE A LONG TIME

12:12.232 --> 12:14.734
SINCE WE'VE HAD A LITTLE GIRL
OF MEXICAN DESCENT.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.737
(Gabrielle chuckles)
 AH, WELL, WE ARE VERY PROUD
OF OUR HERITAGE...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.911
(Gabrielle) MM.
 BUT JUANITA CAN STAND
ON HER OWN MERITS.

12:20.911 --> 12:23.213
SHE'S VERY BRIGHT.
 AND I KNOW I'M BIASED,

12:23.213 --> 12:26.076
BUT I DO THINK
SHE'S A BUDDING YOUNG GENIUS.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.248
I'M MEXICAN?

12:31.181 --> 12:34.184
(chuckles) HONEY,
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

12:34.184 --> 12:36.026
HE CALLED ME MEXICAN.

12:36.026 --> 12:38.458
YOU ARE MEXICAN, HONEY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.231
(chuckles nervously)
 SINCE WHEN?
I THOUGHT WE WERE AMERICAN.

12:43.093 --> 12:46.837
YES, BUT OUR ANCESTORS
CAME FROM MéXICO.

12:46.837 --> 12:48.168
(chuckles nervously)

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
REALLY?
SO WE'RE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE

12:50.170 --> 12:54.144
WHO SELL ORANGES
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

12:54.144 --> 12:56.106
YOU'RE BUSY. WE SHOULD GO.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.548
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

12:58.548 --> 13:01.481
AND, UH, AGAIN, WE REALLY
WANT TO JOIN YOU HERE

13:01.481 --> 13:05.285
AND HELP YOU WITH THAT DIVERSITY
THING, SO JUST LET US KNOW.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.089
(Gabrielle whispers)
JUST SAY IT.
 (Juanita) I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.460
(normal voice) JUST SAY IT!

13:10.460 --> 13:14.064
ADIóS, SEÑOR.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.075
(footsteps approach, rattle)

13:25.075 --> 13:26.406
THIS IS FINE.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.079
THANK YOU.

13:29.079 --> 13:31.882
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING
TO SEE ME.

13:31.882 --> 13:35.185
I CALLED A FEW TIMES,
BUT YOU, UH, DIDN'T PICK UP.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.287
I HAD NO IDEA.

13:37.287 --> 13:41.121
MY PHONE WAS IN MY PANTS POCKET,
AND I HAD IT ON VIBRATE.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.054
AND AS YOU
MAY HAVE NOTICED, I...

13:45.896 --> 13:48.258
SO HOW'S REHAB?

13:48.258 --> 13:49.459
PAINFUL.

13:49.459 --> 13:52.302
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS
WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK,

13:52.302 --> 13:54.564
YOU MAYBE BE ABLE
TO WALK AGAIN SOMEDAY.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.566
YES, THEY'RE VERY UPBEAT
AND OPTIMISTIC.

13:56.566 --> 13:59.469
I WANT TO RUN THEM OVER
WITH THIS CHAIR.

13:59.469 --> 14:01.471
SO...

14:01.471 --> 14:03.843
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.146
WELL, I KNOW WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT LATELY,

14:06.146 --> 14:09.149
BUT I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST
FOR YOU TO COME HOME

14:09.149 --> 14:13.053
SO I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.386
YES, I'D RATHER BE CARED FOR
BY A FLATULENT HELPER MONKEY.

14:16.386 --> 14:19.960
ORSON, I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
BUT I'M STILL YOUR WIFE.
 WELL, APPARENTLY WE HAVE

14:19.960 --> 14:21.962
VERY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS
OF THE WORD "WIFE."

14:21.962 --> 14:24.965
I AM PROCEEDING
WITH THE DIVORCE.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.137
THREE WEEKS AGO YOU WERE
BEGGING ME FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.868
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.401
KARL MAYER HAPPENED.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.103
I COULD FORGIVE YOU

14:33.103 --> 14:35.345
IF YOU BETRAYED ME
WITH ANYONE REMOTELY ADMIRABLE,

14:35.345 --> 14:37.047
BUT YOU CHOSE

14:37.047 --> 14:39.149
THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE MAN
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

14:39.149 --> 14:41.181
NO, BREE,

14:41.181 --> 14:44.284
I DO NOT NEED YOU.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.963
(sighs deeply)

14:54.324 --> 14:56.496
I'M HAVING A RAMP BUILT
AT THE HOUSE,

14:56.496 --> 14:59.099
AND I'VE TURNED THE DOWNSTAIRS
STUDY INTO YOUR BEDROOM.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.301
YOU'RE COMING HOME
WHERE YOU BELONG,

15:01.301 --> 15:03.303
AND THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.606
YOU CAN START FORGIVING ME,
AND I'LL START FORGIVING YOU.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.940
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

15:09.940 --> 15:13.984
I SUGGEST YOU START FIRST.

15:16.286 --> 15:19.289
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW COULD
YOU NOT KNOW YOU'RE MEXICAN?

15:19.289 --> 15:21.151
WE EAT MEXICAN FOOD
ALL THE TIME.

15:21.151 --> 15:24.224
WE EAT CHINESE FOOD, TOO.
DOES THAT MEAN I'M CHINESE?

15:24.224 --> 15:28.598
NO, THAT JUST MEANS
YOUR MOTHER HATES TO COOK.

15:32.162 --> 15:35.165
WELL, APPARENTLY, WE HAVE TO
SPELL EVERYTHING OUT FOR YOU.

15:35.165 --> 15:38.008
YOU DO KNOW YOU'RE A GIRL,
RIGHT?
 GABY.

15:38.008 --> 15:40.010
WHAT? HALF THE WOMEN
IN YOUR FAMILY HAVE MUSTACHES.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.972
IT COULD BE VERY CONFUSING.
 (sighs)

15:44.344 --> 15:47.017
JUANITA, GO INSIDE
AND PLAY WITH YOUR SISTER.

15:47.017 --> 15:50.180
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
TELL HER SHE'S MEXICAN, TOO!

15:52.382 --> 15:54.384
(sighs and whispers)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

15:54.384 --> 15:57.257
(normal voice) WE HAD
THAT SCHOOL RIGHT IN OUR HANDS.

15:57.257 --> 16:01.331
HOW COULD WE LET IT GET AWAY?
 THE BIGGER QUESTION IS
HOW DID WE LET OUR DAUGHTER

16:01.331 --> 16:03.963
GROW UP THINKING SHE'S WHITE?
 HEY, MR. AND MRS. SOLIS.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.435
HEY, PARKER.

16:21.351 --> 16:22.682
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.685
I HAD TO PICK UP SOME LUMBER
TO BUILD THAT RAMP FOR ORSON.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.687
OH, WHAT A GOOD PERSON
YOU ARE.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.390
HEY, I NEED TO PAY
THE PAPERBOY TOMORROW.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.094
DO YOU HAVE ANY CASH?
 I THINK I HAVE A $20 ON ME.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.468
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER...

16:38.468 --> 16:40.330
STICK IT IN HERE?

16:40.330 --> 16:43.033
COULDN'T WE JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE MAILBOX,

16:43.033 --> 16:45.105
LIKE WE USUALLY DO?
 OH, I JUST THOUGHT

16:45.105 --> 16:47.677
THAT'S THE WAY YOU DO IT
DOWN AT DOUBLE D's.

16:47.677 --> 16:51.111
DOUBLE D's?
 YEAH, TURNS OUT
KARL WAS A PART OWNER

16:51.111 --> 16:53.113
AND LEFT ME HIS SHARE.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.614
BY THE WAY,

16:54.614 --> 16:57.347
"DESTINY" SAYS HELLO.

16:57.347 --> 17:01.251
OKAY. I SEE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

17:01.251 --> 17:02.592
DO YOU, MIKE DELFINO?

17:02.592 --> 17:04.654
THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLS YOU,
YOU KNOW.

17:04.654 --> 17:07.357
BECAUSE THAT'S MY NAME.

17:07.357 --> 17:10.260
NO ONE HANGING FROM A POLE
SHOULD KNOW YOUR NAME.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.732
SUSAN, THAT PLACE IS
ONE OF MY ACCOUNTS.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.334
I'M THEIR PLUMBER.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.066
AND THAT'S IT?

17:16.066 --> 17:19.038
YOU GO THERE JUST TO DO
THE PLUMBING AND NOTHING ELSE?
 WELL--

17:19.038 --> 17:22.271
LIAR! DESTINY SAID YOU HAD
A BEER THERE THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:22.271 --> 17:23.413
OKAY.

17:23.413 --> 17:27.217
SOMETIMES WHEN I FINISH THE JOB,
I'LL HAVE A BEER.

17:27.217 --> 17:30.250
AND YOU NEVER
LOOK AT THE GIRLS?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.523
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

17:33.523 --> 17:36.126
I-I-I DON'T BUY THAT.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.758
I WANT TO SEE THE "COMPLETELY
INNOCENT" LOOK YOU HAVE

17:38.758 --> 17:41.261
WHEN DESTINY SHAKES HER TASSELS
IN YOUR FACE.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.063
OKAY, SO I'VE GONE
TO A STRIP CLUB.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.267
ARE WE GONNA LAUGH ABOUT THIS,
OR YOU GONNA MAKE IT A THING?

17:47.267 --> 17:50.540
WELL, I AM LEANING
TOWARDS "THING."
 FINE. IF IT BOTHERS YOU
THAT MUCH,

17:50.540 --> 17:53.543
NEXT TIME I FINISH A JOB THERE,
I'LL COME RIGHT HOME.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.545
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY,

17:55.545 --> 17:59.449
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT BE WORKING
THERE ANYMORE. I FORBID IT.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.811
YOU FORBID IT?

18:01.811 --> 18:05.255
(sighs) WHAT KIND OF MARRIAGE
IS THIS?

18:05.255 --> 18:08.758
THE KIND WHERE THE HUSBAND
WANTS TO LOOK AT STRIPPERS

18:08.758 --> 18:11.261
AND THE WIFE FORBIDS IT.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.163
SUSAN, I LOVE YOU.

18:13.163 --> 18:17.197
I HAVE NEVER CHEATED ON YOU
AND I NEVER WILL.

18:17.197 --> 18:21.371
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
WHAT I CAN OR CAN'T DO.

18:21.371 --> 18:23.373
(door closes)

18:23.373 --> 18:25.835
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--

18:25.835 --> 18:28.838
YOU FORBID MIKE
FROM GOING TO A STRIP CLUB?

18:28.838 --> 18:30.840
I KNOW IT WAS
A LITTLE HEAVY-HANDED,

18:30.840 --> 18:33.843
BUT I JUST CAN'T STAND
THOSE PLACES.
 OH, WHAT'S THE BIG WHOOP?

18:33.843 --> 18:36.516
CARLOS TAKES CLIENTS
TO THE STRIP CLUB ALL THE TIME.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.289
I'VE BEEN TO ONE--
THE ASS MENAGERIE.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.821
IT WAS MY BROTHER'S
BACHELOR PARTY.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.594
THIS STRIPPER NAMED CINNAMON
GAVE ME A LAP DANCE.

18:44.594 --> 18:46.696
LUCKILY, IF I SQUINTED
JUST ENOUGH,

18:46.696 --> 18:49.459
SHE LOOKED LIKE
A YOUNG RICKY SCHRODER.

18:49.459 --> 18:52.462
SEE, THIS IS THE REASON
MEN GO TO THOSE PLACES--

18:52.462 --> 18:56.366
SO THEY CAN FANTASIZE.
WE ALL DO IT.
 YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT OTHER MEN
WHEN YOU'RE WITH CARLOS?

18:56.366 --> 18:58.508
HONEY, CARLOS HAS BEEN
SO MANY DIFFERENT MEN,

18:58.508 --> 19:02.312
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED WHEN
I OPEN MY EYES AND IT'S CARLOS.
 (laughs)

19:02.312 --> 19:04.844
WANT TO KNOW
WHO I FANTASIZE ABOUT?

19:04.844 --> 19:07.317
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
ANYONE WANT MORE WINE?

19:07.317 --> 19:08.578
TOM SCAVO.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.380
(whispers) WINE NOW.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.352
4th OF JULY BARBECUE.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.923
THOSE TAN SHORTS.

19:13.923 --> 19:16.326
OH, I AM THERE RIGHT NOW.
OOH!

19:16.326 --> 19:20.230
OKAY, COULD WE PLEASE GET BACK
TO THE ISSUE AT HAND?

19:20.230 --> 19:21.531
LOOK, BOTTOM LINE IS

19:21.531 --> 19:24.534
YOU CANNOT FORBID A MAN
TO GO TO STRIP CLUBS.

19:24.534 --> 19:27.367
AND DON'T EXPECT HIM TO
UNDERSTAND WHY IT BOTHERS YOU.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.300
THAT'S JUST THE WAY THEY ARE.
RIGHT?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.742
SORRY. I WAS JUST IMAGINING
RICKY SCHRODER...

19:32.742 --> 19:36.206
WEARING TOM SCAVO'S SHORTS.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.377
(clink)

19:49.619 --> 19:52.292
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO JUST GIVE AWAY YOUR CDs?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.624
THE MORE YOU TAKE,
THE LESS I HAVE TO PACK.

19:54.624 --> 19:57.627
IN FACT, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT?
 ANYTHING?

19:57.627 --> 20:01.631
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT... DANNY BOLEN?

20:01.631 --> 20:04.504
UH, HE'S NOT REALLY MINE
TO GIVE.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.237
COME ON.
HE'S TOTALLY INTO YOU,

20:07.237 --> 20:09.639
WHICH IS
A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO ME.

20:09.639 --> 20:12.382
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
I'M JUST GONNA KEEP MY CDs.

20:12.382 --> 20:14.284
OKAY, I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

20:14.284 --> 20:17.216
IT'S JUST
YOU DON'T SEEM INTERESTED,

20:17.216 --> 20:20.550
AND I HAVE SENT EVERY SIGNAL
I CAN THINK OF.
 WHY ARE YOU SO HUNG UP
ON DANNY?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.392
HELLO. HE'S HOT.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.524
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING--

20:24.524 --> 20:27.927
DANNY'S IN KIND OF
A FRAGILE PLACE RIGHT NOW.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.431
HE REALLY DOESN'T NEED
TO GET HIS HEART BROKEN.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.404
I'M NOT GONNA SNAG HIM
JUST TO TOSS HIM ASIDE.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.366
I DON'T USE PEOPLE, JULIE.

20:36.366 --> 20:40.009
OKAY, I USED SOME PEOPLE.

20:40.009 --> 20:42.272
BUT I WOULDN'T USE HIM.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.475
ARE YOU SURE?

20:45.475 --> 20:47.977
YEAH. I THINK
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,

20:47.977 --> 20:52.251
AND IF HE'D JUST SPEND A LITTLE
TIME WITH ME, HE'D REALIZE THAT.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.986
YOU LIKE STAND-UP COMEDY?

20:56.986 --> 20:58.328
YEAH.

20:58.328 --> 21:00.530
TOO BAD.
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE EDDIE.

21:05.995 --> 21:07.697
HEY, HONEY.
 HEY.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.699
SORRY I'M LATE.

21:09.699 --> 21:11.401
HOW WAS WORK?

21:11.401 --> 21:12.842
CRAZY. (chuckles)

21:12.842 --> 21:15.375
I HAD THREE CONFERENCE CALLS

21:15.375 --> 21:17.477
AND A 2-HOUR CLIENT MEETING
WITH GARY DANNER.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.779
OH.
 MM. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.381
EVEN CRAZIER.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.314
I PEED TWICE IN EVERY BATHROOM
IN THE HOUSE.

21:24.314 --> 21:26.656
WHAT'S THAT?

21:26.656 --> 21:30.790
OH, LITTLE MATCHING OUTFITS FOR
THE TWINS THAT PEOPLE GAVE US.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.792
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THEM
TO CHARITY.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.626
I RAN INTO
THE PETERSONS TODAY.

21:36.626 --> 21:39.499
THEY JUST HEARD,
WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WERE.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.701
MM.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.773
SO GARY DANNER--

21:43.773 --> 21:46.476
HE'S A PRICKLY S.O.B.

21:47.877 --> 21:49.609
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.311
CHECK OUT THIS PROPOSAL
I WORKED UP FOR HIM.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.386
HMM.

21:56.386 --> 21:58.988
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "HMM"?

21:58.988 --> 22:01.491
I'M GLAD YOU SHOWED THIS TO ME.
I KNOW DANNER.

22:01.491 --> 22:05.395
AND TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT WANT
TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD.
 WHY NOT?

22:05.395 --> 22:08.027
DON'T WORRY. I CAN FIX IT.
WHERE'S A PEN?
 WAIT, HONEY, A-ACTUALLY...

22:08.027 --> 22:11.461
I SHOWED IT TO DANNER TODAY.
HE LOVED IT.

22:11.461 --> 22:13.763
GARY DANNER LIKED THIS?

22:13.763 --> 22:15.765
NO, HE LOVED IT,

22:15.765 --> 22:18.768
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS CARLOS.
HE TOLD ME IT WAS

22:18.768 --> 22:21.941
THE BEST WRITTEN PROPOSAL
HE HAS EVER SEEN, BAR NONE.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.644
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.115
MEAT LOAF.

22:26.115 --> 22:27.417
MMM.

22:29.819 --> 22:31.421
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:31.421 --> 22:34.554
NOTHING. IT'S J--WELL,
THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT.

22:34.554 --> 22:38.558
YEAH.
 NOT TO MENTION A BIT OF A SLAM
ON THE WORK THAT I DID.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.890
(mouth full) HONEY,
HE'S JUST ENCOURAGING ME.

22:40.890 --> 22:44.363
I DON'T THINK HE WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.
 OH. OKAY.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.036
BY THE WAY, THIS MEAT LOAF--

22:47.036 --> 22:50.039
THE BEST I HAVE EVER TASTED.

22:50.039 --> 22:51.541
BAR NONE?
 HMM?

22:51.541 --> 22:53.142
JUST EAT.

22:58.748 --> 23:01.010
(door creaks)

23:01.010 --> 23:03.082
WOW. IT'S COMING ALONG
BEAUTIFULLY.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.815
THANKS. SO, UH,
WHEN'S ORSON COMING HOME?

23:05.815 --> 23:09.959
OH, UH, IT'S STILL
A BIT UP IN THE AIR.

23:09.959 --> 23:13.463
BUT I GUESS NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO CALL HIM

23:13.463 --> 23:16.466
AND LET HIM KNOW
WE'RE ALMOST READY.
 (beep)

23:16.466 --> 23:19.999
UH, YES.
ORSON HODGE'S ROOM, PLEASE.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.472
WOULD YOU STOP HAMMERING
FOR A MOMENT?

23:24.974 --> 23:26.706
HE CHECKED OUT?

23:26.706 --> 23:30.510
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WHERE WOULD HE HAVE GONE?
 (hammering in distance)

23:30.510 --> 23:33.142
MIKE, PLEASE.
 IT'S NOT ME.

23:36.846 --> 23:39.118
NEVER MIND.
I THINK I FOUND HIM.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.020
(beep)

23:43.122 --> 23:47.156
OH, BOY.
THE FAT'S IN THE FIRE NOW.

23:47.156 --> 23:49.499
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

23:49.499 --> 23:51.901
THE HUSBAND YOU'RE DIVORCING
HAS FOUND NEW DIGS.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.133
BEFORE YOU JUMP
DOWN MY THROAT--

23:54.133 --> 23:56.135
ROY AND I ARE ON
FIXED INCOMES.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.638
YOU CAN'T BLAME US
FOR TAKING IN A BOARDER,

23:58.638 --> 24:02.742
ESPECIALLY ONE WHO CAN'T GET
TO THE SECOND STORY.
 THAT'S OUR NAKED FLOOR.

24:10.179 --> 24:12.181
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:12.181 --> 24:15.224
ENJOYING MY NEW HOME.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.487
IT'S RATHER QUAINT,

24:17.487 --> 24:20.189
ONCE YOU GET USED TO THE SMELL
OF DENTURE CREAM AND SCOTCH.

24:22.692 --> 24:24.734
OH, DON'T MIND ME.

24:24.734 --> 24:28.738
JUST MAKING SURE YOU DON'T SLAP
A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR.

24:28.738 --> 24:32.742
SO HOW ARE YOU PLANNING
TO PAY YOUR RENT?

24:32.742 --> 24:34.744
WELL, I'M A BIT CASH-STRAPPED
AT THE MOMENT,

24:34.744 --> 24:37.476
BUT KAREN KNOWS
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.609
YEAH, ONCE HE GETS
HIS DIVORCE SETTLEMENT,

24:39.609 --> 24:42.481
HE'S WRITING ME
A BIG, FAT CHECK.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.254
SO HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING?
A MONTH, TWO?

24:45.254 --> 24:48.487
THERE WILL BE NO DIVORCE,
AND IF HE TRIES TO FILE FOR ONE,

24:48.487 --> 24:51.160
THERE WILL BE DELAYS, MOTIONS
AND APPEALS.

24:51.160 --> 24:55.064
IT COULD TAKE YEARS
FOR HIM TO EVER SEE A DIME.

24:57.527 --> 24:59.629
YOUR WIFE LOVES YOU. GO HOME.

25:01.130 --> 25:04.574
BREE, STOP RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

25:07.036 --> 25:09.539
SO AM I TAKING DOWN
THE RAMP?

25:09.539 --> 25:10.880
LEAVE IT.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.182
YOU'LL NEED IT SOON ENOUGH.

25:13.182 --> 25:14.884
ALMOST HOME, DEAR.

25:14.884 --> 25:18.187
MIKE, CALL THE POLICE.
MY WIFE IS HOLDING ME HOSTAGE!

25:18.187 --> 25:20.219
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
BIG GUY.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.051
(door slams)

25:31.661 --> 25:33.032
LYNETTE.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.035
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH
MY O.B. AROUND THE CORNER,

25:36.035 --> 25:39.308
AND I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY AND SAY HI.
 OH.

25:39.308 --> 25:41.310
I ALSO WANTED TO THANK YOU

25:41.310 --> 25:45.214
FOR BEING SO NICE TO TOM,
OUR LITTLE TEMP.

25:45.214 --> 25:47.316
HOW'S HE DOING?
 HE'S AMAZING.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.982
IT'S OKAY, CARLOS.
YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH.

25:52.982 --> 25:56.586
HE'S KNOCKING MY SOCKS OFF.
EVERYBODY IS SO IMPRESSED.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.257
WELL, GOOD.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.229
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

26:00.229 --> 26:02.892
I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.

26:02.892 --> 26:05.995
BUT WHEN I DROP THIS KID,
TOM'S OUT ON HIS ASS, RIGHT?

26:05.995 --> 26:07.266
EXCUSE ME?

26:07.266 --> 26:10.269
I LOVE HIM AND I'M GLAD
HE'S DOING WELL HERE,

26:10.269 --> 26:12.271
BUT THIS IS MY JOB.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.274
AT SOME POINT,
I'M GONNA WANT IT BACK.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.878
AND I SAY THAT AS THE WOMAN
WHO DOVE IN FRONT

26:18.878 --> 26:21.350
OF A SPINNING PROPELLER
TO SAVE YOUR CHILD'S LIFE.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.783
(chuckles)

26:23.783 --> 26:26.585
OF COURSE THIS IS YOUR JOB.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.119
AND YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

26:30.119 --> 26:31.160
(sighs)

26:31.160 --> 26:33.262
WELL,
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR.

26:33.262 --> 26:36.365
IT'S JUST THAT I WAS
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

26:36.365 --> 26:39.368
YOU WERE PLANNING TO STAY
AT HOME WITH YOUR BABY.

26:42.632 --> 26:46.135
AND WHY WOULD YOU BE
UNDER THAT IMPRESSION?

26:46.135 --> 26:48.738
THAT'S WHAT TOM SAID.

26:50.239 --> 26:53.913
WHAT EXACTLY DID TOM SAY?

26:53.913 --> 26:58.387
LYNETTE, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

26:58.387 --> 27:00.619
CARLOS, I SAVED
A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.122
IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T
TAKE ANOTHER ONE OUT.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.697
(amplified voice) AND--AND--
AND YOU CAN TRAIN A DOG

27:07.697 --> 27:09.859
TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING,
BUT YOU CAN'T DO, UM,

27:09.859 --> 27:11.831
YOU CAN'T DO WITH CATS AND...
CATS.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.834
AND DID YOU EVER TRY
TO GET A CAT TO FETCH?

27:14.834 --> 27:17.136
THEY'RE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THEY WON'T DO IT.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.070
STUPID CATS. AM I RIGHT, PEOPLE?
 (man coughs, clears throat)

27:21.070 --> 27:24.313
(chuckles nervously) WELL--WELL,
HEY, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT.

27:24.313 --> 27:25.815
GOOD NIGHT.

27:25.815 --> 27:27.847
GIVE IT UP
FOR EDDIE ORLOFSKY!
 (laughter)

27:27.847 --> 27:30.319
(claps)
 (man) COME ON, FOLKS!

27:30.319 --> 27:31.320
YEAH!
 WHOO!

27:33.352 --> 27:36.255
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.257
I NEVER REALIZED THERE WERE

27:38.257 --> 27:41.190
SO MANY DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN DOGS AND CATS. (laughs)

27:41.190 --> 27:43.693
THAT'S WHY I'M THE COMIC, BABE.

27:45.895 --> 27:47.997
I'M OFF TO GET MY FREE DRINK.

27:47.997 --> 27:51.000
(indistinct conversations)

27:52.371 --> 27:54.874
PORTER,

27:54.874 --> 27:57.376
I LEFT MY JACKET IN THE CAR.
WALK ME OUT?

27:57.376 --> 28:01.310
JACKET? IT'S HOT AS HELL
IN HERE.

28:01.310 --> 28:04.313
OOH. NOW I FEEL A CHILL.

28:04.313 --> 28:05.715
MM-HMM.

28:14.023 --> 28:17.396
UM...
I GOTTA USE THE BATHROOM.

28:17.396 --> 28:21.000
OKAY,
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.371
EXCUSE ME?

28:22.371 --> 28:25.775
WHENEVER WE'RE ALONE TOGETHER,
YOU FIND SOME REASON TO BAIL.

28:25.775 --> 28:27.777
WHY AREN'T YOU INTO ME?

28:27.777 --> 28:31.310
ANA, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM
TO BE INTO YOU,

28:31.310 --> 28:33.783
BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH
YOU'RE INTO YOU.

28:33.783 --> 28:36.285
YOU DID NOT
JUST CALL ME CONCEITED.

28:36.285 --> 28:39.288
CHILL. IT'S NOT LIKE
I ASKED YOU TO SPELL IT.

28:39.288 --> 28:42.291
I'M NOT STUPID,
AND I AM DEFINITELY

28:42.291 --> 28:44.794
NOT THE ATTENTION WHORE
AT THIS TABLE.

28:47.026 --> 28:51.100
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR LITTLE STUNT
WITH THE PILLS.

28:51.100 --> 28:53.332
OKAY, THAT WAS MEAN.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.434
I'M SORRY THAT I SAID THAT.

28:58.307 --> 28:59.809
DON'T BE SORRY.

28:59.809 --> 29:01.310
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.317
I LIKE THE BLUNT ANA

29:08.317 --> 29:10.419
MORE THAN THE CUTE ANA.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.483
SO...

29:14.483 --> 29:17.857
YOU THINK I'M CUTE?

29:17.857 --> 29:20.159
(chuckles)

29:21.991 --> 29:25.294
YOU'RE HOME. PERFECT TIMING.

29:25.294 --> 29:26.936
MARGARITAS.
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

29:26.936 --> 29:29.398
WE'RE GETTING DRUNK,
MEXICAN STYLE.

29:29.398 --> 29:31.440
PRINCIPAL HOBSON JUST CALLED,

29:31.440 --> 29:33.272
AND JUANITA GOT ACCEPTED
TO OAKRIDGE.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.904
SERIOUSLY?

29:34.904 --> 29:37.076
I AM FREE
FROM HOMESCHOOLING.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.978
NO MORE FIGHTING,
NO MORE THREATS

29:38.978 --> 29:43.012
AND NO MORE PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCES WITH YOU.

29:43.012 --> 29:44.854
(chuckles) MMM.

29:44.854 --> 29:46.916
(slurps)
 (sets glass on counter)

29:46.916 --> 29:48.787
AHH. COME ON.
START GUZZLIN'.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.860
UH, I DON'T THINK
SHE SHOULD GO.

29:57.566 --> 30:00.199
HUH?
 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT
ALL DAY.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.201
LET'S KEEP HER
IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.174
WE CAN'T. SHE WAS EXPELLED.
 I MADE SOME CALLS.

30:05.174 --> 30:08.277
JEFFERSON ELEMENTARY
CAN TAKE HER.
 THAT'S WAY OUT
IN MT. PLEASANT.

30:08.277 --> 30:10.309
YEAH, AND THERE'S
A LOT OF LATINO FAMILIES

30:10.309 --> 30:12.311
THAT LIVE IN THAT AREA.
 SO WHAT?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.244
WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER SCHOOL
RIGHT HERE IN OUR BACKYARD.

30:15.244 --> 30:17.246
I'M NOT SCHLEPPING
WAY OVER THERE

30:17.246 --> 30:19.388
JUST SO SHE CAN BE
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

30:19.388 --> 30:23.192
"THOSE" PEOPLE?
DON'T YOU MEAN OUR PEOPLE?

30:23.192 --> 30:27.226
OUR PEOPLE ARE
THE RICH PRIVATE SCHOOL PEOPLE.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.599
OH, MY GOD. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

30:30.599 --> 30:34.403
WHAT?
 YOU ARE ASHAMED
OF BEING MEXICAN.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.605
OH, THAT'S INSANE.
 NO, IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE.

30:36.605 --> 30:39.238
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS ARE WHITE.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.271
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO TEACH THE GIRLS SPANISH.
 BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,

30:42.271 --> 30:45.174
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU GUYS
PLOTTING BEHIND MY BACK.
 AND WHEN WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE,

30:45.174 --> 30:48.217
AND I SAID WE WOULD BE THE ONLY
MEXICANS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

30:48.217 --> 30:52.421
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID?
"FINE BY ME."
 YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S MY FAULT.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE REALTOR,

30:52.421 --> 30:54.423
"FORGET SQUARE FOOTAGE
AND CENTRAL AIR.

30:54.423 --> 30:57.426
FIND US SOMETHING NEXT DOOR
TO A MARIACHI BAR."

30:57.426 --> 31:00.559
DENY IT ALL YOU WANT.
YOU ARE A SELF-HATING MEXICAN.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.631
OH, YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE A SELF-WIPING MEXICAN.

31:02.631 --> 31:04.333
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.475
(door creaks)

31:18.407 --> 31:20.209
HEY, YOU.

31:20.209 --> 31:23.482
TRAFFIC WAS INSANE.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.585
IS THERE ANY DINNER LEFT?
I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE LUNCH.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.190
EVERYTHING OKAY?

31:31.190 --> 31:33.993
I TALKED TO CARLOS TODAY.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.594
ABOUT WHAT?

31:35.594 --> 31:38.928
HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT WHEN I HAVE THIS BABY,

31:38.928 --> 31:40.930
I'LL BE STAYING HOME
WITH HER.

31:42.671 --> 31:45.434
WHERE WOULD HE GET
A CRAZY IDEA LIKE THAT?

31:45.434 --> 31:48.337
I TOLD HIM.

31:48.337 --> 31:51.440
WOW!
YOU'RE NOT EVEN DENYING IT?

31:51.440 --> 31:54.343
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

31:54.343 --> 31:56.315
SERIOUSLY?

31:56.315 --> 31:59.618
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THAT JOB MEANS TO ME.

31:59.618 --> 32:03.422
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE
BEING A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

32:03.422 --> 32:07.026
HOW COULD YOU THINK
I'D BE OKAY WITH THIS?

32:07.026 --> 32:10.029
BECAUSE WE LOST A BABY.

32:13.462 --> 32:14.964
(sighs)

32:14.964 --> 32:18.107
HONEY, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO STAY HOME WITH THIS ONE,

32:18.107 --> 32:22.411
BECAUSE SHE'S ALL THE MORE
PRECIOUS, GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED.

32:22.411 --> 32:24.713
OH.

32:24.713 --> 32:27.246
SO THAT'S HOW
I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.979
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
LYNETTE,

32:29.979 --> 32:32.251
BECAUSE YOU NEVER TALK
ABOUT IT.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.254
IT'S BEEN A MONTH.
EVERY TIME I TRY TO BRING IT UP,

32:35.254 --> 32:38.357
YOU JUST--
YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
 BECAUSE I'M DEALING WITH IT.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.490
WELL, SHOULDN'T WE BE
DEALING WITH IT TOGETHER?
 YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

32:41.490 --> 32:44.493
YES!
 FINE! WE LOST A KID.
WE'LL NEVER MEET HIM.

32:44.493 --> 32:47.496
WE'LL SPEND THE REST
OF OUR LIVES LOOKING AT ONE,

32:47.496 --> 32:49.498
ALWAYS WONDERING
WHY THERE AREN'T TWO.

32:49.498 --> 32:52.371
HOW CAN SAYING THIS OUT LOUD
BE HELPFUL?

32:57.276 --> 33:01.280
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT.

33:03.512 --> 33:06.455
YOU WIN.

33:06.455 --> 33:08.457
AFTER YOU HAVE THE BABY,

33:08.457 --> 33:10.459
GO BACK TO YOUR JOB.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.493
THANK YOU.

33:18.367 --> 33:20.999
YOU WANT ME
TO FIX YOU SOMETHING?

33:23.172 --> 33:25.304

33:33.712 --> 33:36.385
THESE LADIES
DON'T WORK FOR FREE.

33:39.448 --> 33:41.120
HEY, ROONEY.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.352
OH, HEY, MIKE.
LONG TIME NO SEE.

33:43.352 --> 33:46.355
YEAH, I GOT THE CALL ABOUT
YOUR JOHN BEING BACKED UP.

33:46.355 --> 33:48.627
WHAT? NO, OUR BATHROOMS
ARE WORKING JUST FINE.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.800
THAT'S WEIRD. SOME WOMAN CALLED
AND SAID IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

33:53.402 --> 33:56.465
I'M SORRY, MAN. I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

33:56.465 --> 33:59.068
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE

33:59.068 --> 34:01.140
OUR NEWEST DOUBLE D DOLL--

34:01.140 --> 34:03.172
MISS FIX-IT!

SUSAN!

34:22.531 --> 34:24.592
MIKE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:24.592 --> 34:27.396
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

34:27.396 --> 34:30.498
OH, WELL,
SINCE I'M ONE OF THE OWNERS,

34:30.498 --> 34:33.502
I FIGURED I SHOULD
REALLY LEARN THE BUSINESS,

34:33.502 --> 34:36.275
FROM MY BOTTOM UP.
 (slap)

34:36.275 --> 34:37.576
HEY, YOU MIND?

34:37.576 --> 34:41.079
I'M TRYING
TO MAKE A DEPOSIT HERE.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.152
(man) HEY!
 WILL YOU COME DOWN FROM THERE
RIGHT NOW?

34:44.152 --> 34:47.686
WHY? THEY'RE JUST LOOKING.
IT'S COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.857
RIGHT?
 (slap)

34:48.857 --> 34:52.261
(hooting and whistling
continues)

34:52.261 --> 34:53.562
HEY, PAL. SIT DOWN.

34:53.562 --> 34:56.125
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO SEE
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.127
(thud)
 THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

34:58.127 --> 34:59.598
OH, I CAN'T TALK.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.471
I'VE GOT A ROOM FULL
OF NEANDERTHALS TO ENTERTAIN.

♪♪♪

35:05.434 --> 35:08.607
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:08.607 --> 35:11.410
JUST GIVING PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

35:13.742 --> 35:16.385
DON'T YOU DARE.
SUSAN, I'M SERIOUS.

35:16.385 --> 35:19.188
I WANT YOU OFF OF THAT STAGE
RIGHT NOW.

35:19.188 --> 35:22.451
WAIT. ARE YOU FORBIDDING ME
FROM DOING SOMETHING?

35:22.451 --> 35:25.594
I THOUGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MARRIAGE.

35:25.594 --> 35:29.528
VERY CUTE. IF I HAVE TO, I WILL
CARRY YOU OUT OF HERE MYSELF.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.660
OH, WHAT EXACTLY IS
THE PROBLEM, MIKE?

35:31.660 --> 35:33.802

 OH!

35:33.802 --> 35:36.505

35:36.505 --> 35:39.868
(shouting indistinctly)

35:39.868 --> 35:41.570
OKAY. I GET IT.

35:41.570 --> 35:44.443
I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE.

LET'S GO HOME, MRS. FIX-IT.
 (laughs)

35:53.552 --> 35:56.485
WAIT. WAIT. FORGOT MY TIPS!

36:35.424 --> 36:37.426
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

36:37.426 --> 36:40.469
NOTHING. JUST SOME OLD PHOTOS.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.803
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD THESE.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.975
WE COULDN'T AFFORD FRAMES,

36:46.975 --> 36:50.239
SO MY DAD WOULD PUT THESE
ON THE WALL WITH TAPE.

36:52.281 --> 36:53.812
IS THAT YOU?

36:53.812 --> 36:57.546
YEAH. I WAS ABOUT 5.

36:57.546 --> 36:58.887
YOU'RE CUTE.
 HMM.

36:58.887 --> 37:02.951
BUT THAT TOOLSHED'S
SEEN BETTER DAYS.

37:02.951 --> 37:05.454
THAT WAS OUR HOUSE.

37:09.598 --> 37:12.731
WOW. (sighs)

37:12.731 --> 37:14.533
IT'S FUNNY.

37:14.533 --> 37:18.667
I'M SMILING IN ALL
OF THESE PHOTOS, BUT...

37:18.667 --> 37:22.240
I HATED THAT TOWN.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.814
EVERYBODY WAS SO POOR.
EVERYBODY WAS MEXICAN.

37:27.876 --> 37:30.579
BACK THEN I THOUGHT
THEY WERE THE SAME THING.

37:32.521 --> 37:37.326
AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY 5,
I KNEW I WANTED OUT.

37:40.329 --> 37:42.331
AND YOU CAN CALL IT
SELF-LOATHING, CARLOS,

37:42.331 --> 37:44.693
BUT I JUST...

37:44.693 --> 37:49.638
DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO EVER
KNOW I LIVED LIKE THAT.

37:53.342 --> 37:55.904
THAT'S YOUR DAD.

37:55.904 --> 37:57.546
YEAH.

37:58.747 --> 38:00.509
HE WAS SO STRONG.

38:00.509 --> 38:02.511
I WOULD RUN TO MEET HIM

38:02.511 --> 38:05.514
WHEN HE'D COME HOME
FROM WORKING IN THE FACTORIES,

38:05.514 --> 38:09.318
AND HE'D LIFT ME UP
ON HIS SHOULDERS.

38:09.318 --> 38:11.620
I LOVED THAT.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.522
I BET HE DID, TOO.

38:15.824 --> 38:20.529
I USED TO ASK HIM, "PAPá,
 WHY DO YOU WORK SO MUCH?"

38:20.529 --> 38:22.030
AND HE WOULD SAY,

38:22.030 --> 38:25.334
"SO ONE DAY WE CAN LIVE
IN A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE."

38:28.507 --> 38:30.539
BUT WE NEVER DID.

38:32.841 --> 38:36.645
(sighs) BUT YOU DO NOW.

38:39.948 --> 38:42.591
YOUR FATHER HAD DREAMS,
GABY,

38:42.591 --> 38:44.593
BUT THEY WERE FOR YOU,

38:44.593 --> 38:47.396
AND HE SACRIFICED A LOT
TO GET YOU HERE.

38:50.629 --> 38:53.962
WHATEVER OUR CHILDREN
ACHIEVE IN LIFE,

38:53.962 --> 38:55.964
IT'S BECAUSE OF DREAMS
THAT STARTED

38:55.964 --> 39:01.610
ON THE SHOULDERS
OF A PROUD, STRONG, MEXICAN MAN.

39:01.610 --> 39:04.713
THAT IS WHY I WANT OUR KIDS
TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

39:09.478 --> 39:11.980
I WANT THAT, TOO.

39:23.892 --> 39:26.665
SO, UM...

39:26.665 --> 39:29.668
HOW DO YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

39:32.671 --> 39:35.674
DO THEY THINK
YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.584
ORSON, IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.617
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TALK TO ME SOMETIME.

39:48.617 --> 39:52.561
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS,
BREE.

39:52.561 --> 39:56.064
REVEREND SYKES STOPPED BY
TO CHECK ON MY PROGRESS.

39:56.064 --> 39:58.066
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIMSELF

39:58.066 --> 40:01.830
FOR CONVINCING YOU
TO TAKE ME ON AS CHARITY WORK.

40:01.830 --> 40:04.803
IT'S NOT CHARITY WORK.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.806
WHEN I HAD THAT AFFAIR,
I DIDN'T JUST BETRAY YOU.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.178
I BETRAYED MY FAITH AS WELL.

40:10.178 --> 40:13.512
SO PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO
LET ME HELP YOU OR I AM G--

40:13.512 --> 40:15.614
OR YOU WON'T GET
INTO HEAVEN?

40:18.747 --> 40:21.119
DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU.

40:23.552 --> 40:26.895
I GUESS I CAN FIND A WAY
TO BE HAPPY.

40:26.895 --> 40:29.558
THANK YOU SO MUCH, ORSON.

40:29.558 --> 40:32.861
I AM GONNA TAKE
SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOU.

40:35.504 --> 40:36.565
(clink)

40:36.565 --> 40:38.907
BY THE WAY, MY SOUP IS COLD.

40:38.907 --> 40:40.509
OH.

40:40.509 --> 40:43.612
WELL, MINE IS HOT.

40:43.612 --> 40:46.014
YOU CAN HAVE THIS.

40:53.722 --> 40:57.055
OH, WHILE YOU'RE UP, COULD YOU
GET ME A GLASS OF WINE?

40:57.055 --> 41:00.659
YES, OF COURSE.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.631
AND PERHAPS FOR DESSERT,

41:02.631 --> 41:05.664
SOME OF YOUR DELICIOUS
CRèME BRûLéE.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.136
ORSON, THAT TAKES OVER AN HOUR
TO PREPARE. I--

41:08.136 --> 41:10.799
WELL, I WOULD DO IT MYSELF,
BUT...

41:20.609 --> 41:24.082
OH, AND WE'RE OUT
OF VANILLA BEANS.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.616
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO RUN
TO THE STORE.

41:44.573 --> 41:46.675
(silverware clinks)

41:48.276 --> 41:52.641
THE ACT ITSELF IS
QUITE SIMPLE--

41:52.641 --> 41:55.614
YOU STRIP AWAY THE OUTER LAYER

41:55.614 --> 41:58.817
AND REVEAL WHAT'S UNDERNEATH.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.518
OF COURSE,

42:00.518 --> 42:05.694
SOMETIMES THE RESULTS
CAN BE QUITE SURPRISING.

42:05.694 --> 42:09.828
IF YOU STRIP AWAY THE VENEER
OF HAPPY DOMESTICITY,

42:09.828 --> 42:13.101
YOU MAY FIND GRIEF.

42:13.101 --> 42:17.566
IF YOU STRIP AWAY
THAT FACADE OF WEALTH,

42:17.566 --> 42:21.239
YOU MAY FIND SELF-LOATHING.

42:21.239 --> 42:26.615
IF YOU STRIP AWAY
THE VEIL OF HELPLESSNESS,

42:26.615 --> 42:31.079
YOU MAY FIND CRUELTY.

42:31.079 --> 42:38.086
YES, STRIPPING CAN BE
A DANGEROUS PASTIME.

42:38.086 --> 42:41.289
BUT FOR A LUCKY FEW,

42:41.289 --> 42:43.561
IT CAN ALSO BE...

42:43.561 --> 42:46.294
A LOT OF FUN.
