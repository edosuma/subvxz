WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.560
Let the fun commence.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.320
(cheering)

00:09.400 --> 00:10.960
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:14.360 --> 00:17.680
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.320 --> 00:21.600
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.160
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.280 --> 00:27.960
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.040 --> 00:30.000
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.080 --> 00:32.960
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.040 --> 00:36.800
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:41.440 --> 00:43.440
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.360 --> 00:45.960
I do really, really love him

00:47.280 --> 00:48.600
'Some want revenge.'

00:48.680 --> 00:51.040
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:51.120 --> 00:52.440
Let go now!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.640
No-one fucking likes you!
See ya later.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.800
'And others just want to
wreck the gaff.'

00:58.600 --> 01:00.680
Hey!

01:01.360 --> 01:03.880
That'll be someone's fucking head
in a minute.

01:03.960 --> 01:07.400
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:07.480 --> 01:10.680
It's gonna be fucking fireworks.
'...casing misery...'

01:10.760 --> 01:12.120
(sobs)
What am I gonna do?

01:12.200 --> 01:14.280
You will never ever have me
ever again.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.520
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:16.600 --> 01:19.000
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:20.160 --> 01:23.520
Oh!
'It's gonna get explosive'

01:23.600 --> 01:25.120
And fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:25.200 --> 01:27.840
Fucking slag!

01:28.960 --> 01:32.120
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.600
Me heart is breaking.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.680 --> 02:01.960
'Heading full throttle to the beach
is our first sexy single, Josh.'

02:02.040 --> 02:04.320
'If anyone can make 'em laugh,
he can.'

02:04.400 --> 02:06.120
I've never been in love before,

02:06.200 --> 02:08.919
but I've made love to
several girls at once.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.640
Hashtag fill your boots up. Wahey!
(laughs)

02:12.720 --> 02:14.960
I am a naughty little fucker.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.600
I love women and women love me.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.960
(laughs)

02:20.040 --> 02:21.720
I've got the full package.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.240
(laughs)

02:25.360 --> 02:27.800
First one in. What you sayin'?

02:27.880 --> 02:31.560
I can't fuckin' wait for this, you
know. I'm a ten out of ten, baby.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
(laughs)

02:32.720 --> 02:35.560
Let's do this.
Show me the fuckin' sorts.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.440
'Bang on cue,
here's posh uni student Maisie.'

02:40.400 --> 02:42.200
'She's also a VIP hostess

02:42.280 --> 02:45.320
and loves nothing more
than feeding her donkeys.'

02:45.400 --> 02:46.480
'No, really.'

02:46.560 --> 02:48.600
I am very aware of
being the posh totty.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.720
But there's more to me than wealth.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.560
I can get leathered down the
fucking back streets of Cardiff.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.880
And I really like a bit of rough.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.960
I'd get myself 11 out of ten
for looks.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.400
Only because 11 is
my favourite number.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.600
I'm Maisie.
Daisy?Maisie.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.000
You all right?
Josh is unbelievably good looking.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.920
What's your type?
You.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.120
Easy.
More tattoos, though.Right.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.360
Do you have any?
No.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.240
That's fine.
Give us a spin.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.640
You're in good nick. Yeah,
this new girl, Maisie or Daisy,

03:17.720 --> 03:19.520
got a right crackin' arse.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.440
I'm lookin' to either get me tongue
in between her shit box or me cock.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.880
'Oh, what a charmer.'
Wahey!

03:25.960 --> 03:27.480
If any more fit boys come in,

03:27.560 --> 03:30.400
I don't think I'm gonna know
what to do with myself.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.480
'Sexy single number three is Sean.
He's a stripper with a big...'

03:35.320 --> 03:36.440
'...personality.'

03:36.520 --> 03:39.680
I like to think of myself
as a modern day Jack Sparrow.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.960
I'm just a pirate
looking for my treasure. Arr.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.440
Trust me, girls do not yawn
when they're shagging Sean.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.040
I mean, that's gotta be
nine inches, ain't it?

03:51.120 --> 03:55.560
Fucking hell, you're shredded,
aren't you, lad? (laughs)

03:55.640 --> 03:56.840
See ya later, Josh.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.680
I'm a big fan of tattoos. Which
ones have you got? Can I see? Ah!

04:00.760 --> 04:03.880
Already showing interest.
What do you do?Stripper.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.600
I say I'm a stripper, she's on
the floor and she wants a dance.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.440
Shall I split my legs? Oh, fuck.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.120
My fanny's tingling. And all I
can think is, Sean ticks my ox.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.560
You're absolutely amazing.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.320
'Guaranteed to keep the temperature's
rising is glamour model Harriette.'

04:21.399 --> 04:24.240
I'm so sick of bad boys.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.160
I need a real man.
I need a soldier.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.120
(dog growls)

04:28.200 --> 04:30.560
If a guy thinks that
he's gonna get with me

04:30.640 --> 04:34.160
on the first night of meeting me,
you've got another thing coming.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.400
I'm just not that kind of girl.
I'm actually quite feisty.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.000
I like to use... my brain

04:40.080 --> 04:43.520
to figure out, erm, exactly what is,

04:43.600 --> 04:45.560
like, the deal with everything.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.960
I'm coming out there to show boys
exactly what I can do.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.560
What's happening?
Hi, guys.Hi, you all right?

04:51.640 --> 04:54.160
What do you do, babe?
I'm a glamour model.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.320
Really?
Yeah.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.280
What do you do?
Journalism and politics at Cardiff.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.400
Wow.
Yeah.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.920
Harriette is fit as fuck.
I'll graft on her.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.720
I'm gonna massage her pass-age
with my saus-age.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.280
You looking to have fun or what?

05:07.360 --> 05:08.440
Erm...

05:09.480 --> 05:12.800
Yeah, obviously I wanna have fun.
Josh is really friendly.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.280
Don't really like nice guys,
to be fair.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.800
Maybe it's a change.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.400
'Looks like these suckers
haven't yet figured out

05:21.480 --> 05:24.520
their entire world
is gonna get ripped to shreds,

05:24.600 --> 05:29.960
as more exes than ever before
are piling in, ready to cause chaos

05:30.040 --> 05:31.720
for everyone.'

05:33.320 --> 05:36.640
'Next to grace us with his Greek
god-like presence is Alex.'

05:36.720 --> 05:40.200
'He's got a body to die for
and the banter to match.'

05:40.280 --> 05:43.200
Life's not about the amount
of breaths you take,

05:43.280 --> 05:46.080
it's about the moments
that take your breath away.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.400
I used to be a massive geek
until I got the sweet of vagina,

05:49.480 --> 05:53.640
and ever since then, I've just been
playing girls, not video games.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.600
(groans) I feel like if you
give off a positive vibe,

05:57.680 --> 05:59.800
you're giving off good vibes.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.120
S'appening, bro?
Nice to meet you, bro.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.480
Josh, mate. What the fuck
are them shorts he's got on?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.680
He looks ridiculous.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.080
They do look, like,
fucking right bright.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.920
You gotta stand out.
Exactly.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.440
Alex, I feel like my mum
would just love him.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.640
She'd wanna have a cup of tea
with him. Yeah, really cute.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.560
'Hoping for a fairy-tale ending
is Zahida,

06:22.640 --> 06:25.720
an angel of the north,
but with a devilish side.'

06:25.800 --> 06:29.440
The person I wish I could be
more like is Mother Teresa.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.600
She never flashed her shoulder
or her ankle in her life,

06:32.680 --> 06:34.520
never mind her boob. Unlike me.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.400
When it comes to boys,
I'm definitely possessive, psycho.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.880
This is a girl who fancies
my ex-boyfriends

06:40.960 --> 06:43.000
and she's burning into flames.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.600
I've followed my ex-boyfriend,
spied on him.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.120
Yes, I've took it that far.
Don't judge me.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.240
Be scared of me because I'm
fucking mental. (laughs)

06:51.320 --> 06:52.360
Hi.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.560
How you doin'?
I'm Zahida.Sean.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.320
Zahida.
Have a drink.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.720
Thank you. I need one.She's
rocking that bikini really well.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.760
Love to get my teeth in that.
What kind of guy are you into?

07:02.840 --> 07:06.840
Someone big, loves a drink and won't
tell us off for saying "cunt".

07:06.920 --> 07:09.400
Zahida turns up,
she's loud, in your face.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.200
I can see it getting annoying.
What do you do?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.880
Modelling, dancing, fire breathing.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.080
Yeah, a little bit same.
What do you do?

07:17.160 --> 07:19.640
Naked butler, stripper.
Stripper?

07:19.720 --> 07:20.800
Was, yeah.
Cheeky.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.800
Looking at Sean, I do fancy him.
I want to crack on with him.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.320
Do you have tattoos on your back?
Only some.Give us a twirl.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.320
Can you not touch my man, please?

07:31.240 --> 07:35.640
'Now, here's Zaralena. She's a dog
lover who runs a fashion empire

07:35.720 --> 07:38.200
from her living room. Impressive.'

07:38.280 --> 07:41.480
I'm thick as pig shit,
so I was like, "What can I do?"

07:41.560 --> 07:46.240
So I just started making dresses
and now, boom.(dog whimpers)

07:46.320 --> 07:49.720
I rarely wear short skirts,
but I like see-through things.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.720
I don't like anything slutty
or trashy looking.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.880
Coco?!

07:53.960 --> 07:57.760
In ten years time, it would be nice
to have a nice partner and a family,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.880
but knowing my luck,
I'll end up having ten Chihuahuas.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.000
(barking)
She's ruined it. Little fucker.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.040
Hi.
You all right?

08:06.120 --> 08:10.320
This little rocket rocks up
called Zara... lena.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.040
Hello.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.120
Dark hair, dark skin, great body.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.280
Bang on my type.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.200
High fives all round.
Thank you.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.160
Welcome to the group.
First impression of the guys,

08:21.240 --> 08:22.840
there's a few hotties there.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.760
What's your type, babe?
Tall, blue eyes...

08:25.840 --> 08:28.080
I'm not describing you.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.680
(laughter)
Chill out, chill out.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.400
(laughs) She's a grafter.
Gonna have to have to graft her.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.000
'Last but not least is Ross.
He's no stranger to the beach.'

08:40.080 --> 08:42.559
I was the first ever ex
to come out of the sea.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.400
Oh, my God!
I'm newly single and I'm back.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.720
'But unlike the others,
he knows exactly why he's here.'

08:49.800 --> 08:53.200
I'm feeling fresher than ever,
bigger than ever, more tattoos,

08:53.280 --> 08:56.080
got white hair.
I'm gonna go back there and kill it.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.640
For me, style's a big thing,
whether you're a guy or a girl.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.760
Some people have it, some don't.
Luckily, I've got it.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Here we go again.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.760
There's this guy
walking towards me...

09:13.600 --> 09:15.600
Oh, my God. This guy's hot.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.880
Hi, babe. You all right?
I'm Harriette.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.600
Ross. Nice to meet you.
What is up with that hair?

09:20.680 --> 09:22.160
Looks like a blue rinse.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.800
I'm buzzing.
It's nice to see everyone.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.640
Gonna try and be the alpha male,
ain't he?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.360
I'm the alpha male, Ross. I am.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
So, what kind of bird
you looking for?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.080
Her.
(laughter)

09:35.160 --> 09:38.880
I'm making it clear that I fancy
Harriette. We'll see what happens.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.840
Forward, I like it.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.600
I think I'm in there.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.160
'Harriette's happy, but Ross's
arrival is causing suspicion

09:46.240 --> 09:47.440
among the clueless.'

09:47.520 --> 09:51.000
I recognise your face.I did the
first series of Ex on the Beach.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.080
Ex on the Beach?
I was the first ex.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.280
I feel sick now.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.520
Why?
Have you all got, like, bad exes?

09:56.600 --> 09:58.200
Yes.
Yes.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.600
'Surely one of them's gonna twig?'

10:01.680 --> 10:03.400
'Er, anyone?'

10:04.160 --> 10:07.280
'Nah? Maybe this'll help.'
(tablet chimes)

10:07.360 --> 10:08.520
Oh, what's that?

10:09.840 --> 10:12.040
(gasps) Oh! No.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.160
Oh, I don't want this
to be going on now.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.520
Right, what the fuck's going on?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.640
"Welcome, everyone.
This no ordinary holiday."

10:19.720 --> 10:21.960
"You're On Ex on the Beach.'

10:22.040 --> 10:23.880
For fuck's sake.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.200
This is a fucking joke.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.080
What the fuck have I
let myself in for?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.600
'Well, that's the bad news
out of the way.'

10:30.680 --> 10:32.520
'Over to Sean to deliver the good.'

10:32.600 --> 10:35.680
"It's date time.
Ross and Harriette..."

10:35.760 --> 10:37.840
Ooh.
Oh. That's it, then.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.320
"...you're off on a
mesmerising date together,

10:41.400 --> 10:43.720
but will it be food
or will it be love?"

10:44.560 --> 10:46.480
I'm well chuffed.
I'm a bit gutted.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.920
Jealous?
Little bastard.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.800
Every single guy here fancies her.
I've got her.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.280
'While Ross and Harriette
head off on their date...'

10:57.080 --> 11:01.000
'...the rest are let loose
on their new luxury villa.'

11:01.080 --> 11:03.000
Oh, my God.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.680
This villa is fucking mega.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.880
Pool's sick,
the little garden is sick.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.680
(screams)

11:11.760 --> 11:15.720
Outside double bed. Imagine doing
doggy on that, with those views.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
'You can even live out
your fantasies inside.'

11:18.880 --> 11:22.680
'And if you're really lucky, get
the keys to the private penthouse.'

11:22.760 --> 11:26.000
'But right now, all eyes are
on the big letter outside.'

11:26.080 --> 11:29.560
Fucking hell!
Helipad!

11:29.640 --> 11:32.520
I don't think it's big enough
for my chopper. Wahey!

11:32.600 --> 11:36.280
We're all having a good time,
an ex lands on that.Fuck that.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.200
'All right, Alex,
spoil the fun, why don't you?'

11:41.320 --> 11:43.760
Who do you fancy?
Anyone for Alex?

11:45.080 --> 11:48.360
(laughs)
There's someone called Alex?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.560
Josh really fancies you.
Really?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.840
Yeah.
We'll see. What about you?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.280
I like Sean. Tall, tattooed.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.880
I like Sean as well.
Are we gonna have a problem?

11:57.960 --> 12:01.680
Sean is a solid ten out of ten.
Let the best girl fucking win.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.960
Maisie's no competition to me
at all.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.000
She's not got a chance.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.920
'As rivalries mount in the villa,
Ross and Harriette only have eyes

12:11.000 --> 12:12.040
for each other.'

12:12.120 --> 12:15.320
As cringey as it sounds,
you pretty much, from head to toe,

12:15.400 --> 12:17.080
are my type.
Really?

12:17.160 --> 12:18.720
Yeah.
You're so full of it.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.440
I'm not.
Pinkie promise?

12:20.520 --> 12:23.520
Pinkie promise.
I ain't chatting shit.Cute.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.920
He's really hot. (laughs)

12:27.680 --> 12:29.560
Shall we have a shot?
Yeah.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.920
Cheers.
Cheers.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.880
For me, Harriette's the only girl
in here that I like.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.240
(coughs) It's made my chest warm.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.720
I don't wanna leave this date
without a kiss.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.720
I wanna go back to the villa
with her.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.800
I think we should have
another shot.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.320
You want to kiss me, don't you?
No!

12:50.400 --> 12:52.800
(laughs) Joking.
On the first date?

12:53.960 --> 12:55.160
No, it is not.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.960
Do you wanna kiss me?
Yeah.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.600
I don't know how he managed it.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.880
A few shots of Ouzo,
kissed the bird. Winner.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.280
Get me back to the villa.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.280
You're gonna have to pull me up
both hands. (laughs)

13:14.720 --> 13:18.720
'It's their first night together,
and that means only one thing.'

13:18.800 --> 13:20.560
(chatter)

13:20.640 --> 13:24.200
The drinks are flowing and
everyone's having a good night.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.080
I do think Zara fancies me a bit.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.040
I'm just gonna try and crack on
with her, aren't I?

13:29.800 --> 13:32.680
I am loving this.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.440
Let's fucking spin the fucker.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.600
(laughs) Sean.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.080
Every time Sean comes near us,
I get a bit of a fanny flutter.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.160
(cheering)

13:45.240 --> 13:48.280
It takes one spin
to ruin everything.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.960
Here she goes.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.280
You don't need to do that.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.560
You don't have to do a dare.
Sticking up for us.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.720
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
I'd tell you to fuck yourself.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.200
I'm not a shit-bag.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.800
Why would anyone want to
suck on Josh's toe?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.560
He ain't royalty.
I'll lick his toe for the craic.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.040
I don't mind getting a toe in me
mouth, nose, arsehole. Whatever.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.800
(laughter)

14:17.360 --> 14:20.480
wasn't as bad as I thought.
Could've washed them.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.400
Fuck's sake.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.480
I'm not a shit-bag.
I wouldn't do it.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.040
You're so negative.
Zara's taking everyone so seriously.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.360
She's boring as fuck.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.080
Oh, the guy pisses me off.
(groans)

14:37.560 --> 14:41.240
She's a sponge fun.
She's soaking up all the fun.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.720
Excuse me, babe, don't come back.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.880
Josh is just being
an absolute cannon,

14:45.960 --> 14:49.360
pissing birds off for fun.
He definitely ain't pulling no-one.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.440
They all hate on me.
Whatever. Fuck 'em.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.360
'Looks like the villa's
already starting to crack.'

14:59.440 --> 15:03.400
'But will it crumble to the ground
when the exes start to roll in?'

15:03.480 --> 15:06.000
'First arrival, T-minus 12 hours.'

15:07.320 --> 15:12.000
'The fun and games might be over, but
one thing is just getting started.'

15:12.080 --> 15:13.280
(tablet chimes)

15:13.360 --> 15:15.480
Oh.
Fuck's sake.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.240
Everybody's on edge.
I don't like this tablet.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.800
"It's time for two lucky people
to see inside the penthouse."

15:21.880 --> 15:25.520
(groans)
"It's you, Zahida, and Sean."

15:25.600 --> 15:27.480
(all cheer)

15:27.560 --> 15:29.440
Oh, my fucking Lord!

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
It's going down.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.680
Zee's been all over me today.
We're definitely gonna bang.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.960
Enjoy, guys, anyway.
Have a good night.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.120
Have fun, guys.
Bye, Maisie! (laughs)

15:39.200 --> 15:41.440
How are you feeling about that?
It's cool.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.440
As long as they have fun,
that's all that matters.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.560
I'm actually fucking gutted.
I wanna take that tablet,

15:47.640 --> 15:49.200
shove it up someone's arse.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.760
Champagne as well. Oh, my God.
(laughs)

16:01.000 --> 16:04.120
'As Sean heads for the finish line
with Zahida,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.880
Ross is still struggling
to get started.'

16:06.960 --> 16:08.520
I honestly do like you.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.920
'Aww, how sweet.'
I promise you.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.240
I'm hoping, tonight, we'll end up
staying in bed together.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.160
I'd love something to happen,
but I'm not gonna push it.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.440
(laughs) You're smitten.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.720
I honestly didn't think that
I was gonna connect with a guy

16:23.800 --> 16:25.440
on the first night.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.720
(laughs)

16:30.480 --> 16:33.200
A little cuddle would be nice,
with Ross.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.080
But that's as far as it's gonna go.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.880
I've got morals.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.600
'Morals?'

16:40.320 --> 16:42.640
'If only everyone in the villa
had those.'

16:42.720 --> 16:45.120
Obviously, first night
is not acceptable.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.080
But after 12:00, it's a new day,
new beginning.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.600
Let's go to bed together, Sean.
Goodnight.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.640
(moans)

16:56.840 --> 16:59.000
I knew it was gonna happen. (laughs)

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
(laughter)

17:05.560 --> 17:06.920
Tell us all.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.800
Did you have a kiss?

17:10.560 --> 17:11.720
(laughter)

17:11.800 --> 17:14.200
I knew always,
I was gonna bang first.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.240
Go on then, is she decent in bed?

17:17.720 --> 17:20.040
(gasps) What?

17:20.119 --> 17:23.920
I like to think Zahida's out of the
picture. I'm feeling quite happy.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.520
I won't stop until he comes.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.560
Oh, my... That quick?

17:29.480 --> 17:33.120
Oh, my God. I feel so sorry for you.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.920
You were bored.
(laughter)

17:37.000 --> 17:40.360
Tomorrow, I cannot wait
just to drop him in it.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.080
Fucking this is what I live for.
I think it's gonna be right funny.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.520
(laughs)

17:52.640 --> 17:56.400
I've woke up this morning,
I'm laying next to Ross,

17:56.480 --> 17:58.680
feeling pretty good.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.360
Things are going amazing with
Harriette. She's hot, I fancy her.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.720
But why the fuck's
she got a jumper on?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.320
If you're cold, babe,
I'll keep you warm.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.200
You all right?

18:11.880 --> 18:13.680
(laughter)

18:13.760 --> 18:16.160
Realised that I was
a bit harsh on Zara.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.520
She's a nice enough girl. My plan of
action is to do the baby footsteps

18:20.600 --> 18:22.720
until someone else fitter comes in.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.640
(laughs)

18:24.720 --> 18:26.920
My first night in the villa
was amazing.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.480
Someone had to christen
the penthouse.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.120
I think she's expecting round two.
I just want breakfast.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.840
Morning.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.200
Let the fun commence.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.520
So, how were last night?
Fucking great, wasn't it?

18:42.600 --> 18:45.360
Was it? You have a good time?
Banged, didn't we?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.200
Did you? Decent?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.200
Fell asleep on us.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.360
Did you fall asleep on him?
I think so.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.360
(laughter)

18:55.440 --> 18:58.600
There's literally nothing
to not laugh at with that.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.480
Fuck off, Maisie. I can hint
a little bit of jealousy.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.760
So, was it a good experience then?
That's all I want to know.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.960
I think you're lying to me!

19:11.800 --> 19:14.120
He will not stop mugging me off.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.840
You rate her out of ten.
Oh, my God.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.560
Awkward.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.400
You gotta be honest,
you know what I mean.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.800
We'll play it safe and say five.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.080
Five out of fucking ten?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.920
That's fucking shit!

19:31.000 --> 19:33.400
Shame.
I've never been lower than an eight.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.440
If that was me,
I'd be fucking fuming.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.600
Aww, bless you.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.760
'It's not been the best morning
for Zahida...'

19:43.840 --> 19:45.040
(tablet chimes)

19:45.120 --> 19:48.200
'...but this could make things
a whole lot worse.'

19:48.280 --> 19:51.520
If that tablet fucks me over,
I'll launch it into the pool.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.120
I actually feel a bit sick.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.960
"The first ex is almost here."
Oh, my God.

19:57.040 --> 20:01.880
"Will Maisie, Sean and Zahida
please make their way

20:01.960 --> 20:05.520
down to the beach?"
I don't wanna go to the beach.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.160
I am absolutely bricking it.

20:07.240 --> 20:11.320
Me and Zahida shagged last night.
Let's just pray it's Maisie's ex.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.160
My ex Joe could be coming in,
and I've already slept with someone.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.080
I just want to cry.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.080
If my ex-boyfriend finds out
I've had sex with Sean,

20:20.160 --> 20:22.560
there's going to be
massive arguments

20:22.640 --> 20:25.560
and he's going to get with someone
in front of me face.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.840
He's gonna think I did it
for revenge.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.160
Zahida's absolutely distraught.
She is the one that fucked up.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.560
It's like I don't have
a leg to stand on now.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.280
If me ex comes in,
I want to talk to him.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.360
I just don't wanna see him.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.240
It's really scary.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.920
I've had to consider exes
who I didn't even remember I had.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.840
And it's absolutely making me shit
myself. It's actually horrible.

20:57.920 --> 21:01.840
The moment I see a girl walk down
there, I will fucking change.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.080
Do they all hate you?
Pretty much, yeah.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.680
After what happened with Zahida,
if it's my ex or hers, I'm fucked.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.520
We had such a good night. This will
throw so much shit up in the air.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.240
I can't deal with this.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.960
I wasn't expecting to be here
straight away.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.960
I've fucked it for myself.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.480
God.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.280
I think it's yours.
I definitely think it's yours.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.600
Oh, my God.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.240
'After last night's argument,

21:40.320 --> 21:44.280
the Tablet of Terror sent Josh
and Zaralena on a wine tasting date.'

21:44.360 --> 21:47.600
'Wonder if Josh will be
able to pop her cork.'

21:47.680 --> 21:50.360
Let's get this
over and done with then.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.560
(laughs) You prick.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.160
This date with me and Zara, I think,
is gonna be slightly awkward

21:58.240 --> 22:02.200
cos of last night. But I'm
willing to smooth it all over.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.120
Don't really want him near me
right now.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.840
Fucking hell.
This is gonna be a graft, innit?

22:08.920 --> 22:10.920
I'm glad we've got this one-on-one,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.640
give you a chance to say sorry
for being a prick.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.840
Yeah, that was a bit out of order.
I'm sorry for that.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.640
Wow.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.720
Zara took the apology well.
Let's start grafting.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.520
How many dates does it take
for a lad to get you in bed?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.200
Three.
Three?

22:28.280 --> 22:31.240
All right, sweet.
At least we've one out of the way.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.800
He's a sweetie really.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.280
How can you stay mad at that face?

22:35.360 --> 22:38.160
Come closer, I don't smell.
I'm not gonna bite you.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.880
What about if I'm after
a spoon tonight? (laughs)

22:40.960 --> 22:42.240
We'll see what happens.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.000
I think me and Zara
are gonna go back to the villa,

22:45.080 --> 22:46.880
she's gonna spoon me...

22:49.160 --> 22:51.760
...and fondle with me cock.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.400
I can't look at this water
any more. I wanna cry.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.360
I know for a fact
Zahida's fucking bricking it.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.400
I can't imagine any of my exes
kicking off with me.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.720
But I've not shagged anyone,
so I'm good.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Oh, my God.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.680
Maybe think positively.
Maybe. I'm not sure.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.920
I mean, you've shagged Sean, but...
Yeah, you're living it.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.120
Maisie's fucking really
getting on me fucking tits.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.840
I'm absolutely sick to death
of that girl now.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.400
I'm not gonna just sit there
and let him do it.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.920
He'll just go with anyone.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.360
I can't believe
this is going to happen

23:31.440 --> 23:34.560
and I've just fucked it for myself.
Oh, my God.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.720
Oh, my God.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.400
Oi, oi. We fucking swerved it.
(laughs)

23:57.480 --> 23:58.480
All right?

24:00.720 --> 24:03.600
(sobs) Oh, my God.
What am I gonna do?

24:05.640 --> 24:08.280
What's the matter?
(sobs)

24:14.640 --> 24:17.600
What do you mean?
What are you doing here?

24:17.680 --> 24:18.800
What you been doing?

24:20.120 --> 24:22.360
(sighs) Joey, you broke up with me.
Right.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.080
What have you been doing?
Stop making that face.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.720
I'm Joe, I'm from Newcastle,
I've touched the lives of many

24:28.800 --> 24:30.480
and the fanny of many more.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.680
On a night out,
I'm absolutely mental.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.160
I don't give a shit
what I say to anyone.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.080
And I get myself into
quite a bit of bother sometimes.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.360
(laughs)

24:39.440 --> 24:41.960
When it comes to lasses,
the fitter they are,

24:42.040 --> 24:43.400
the more psycho they are.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.880
My ex is an absolute nutcase.
When it were bad, it was the worst.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.440
But I love her to pieces.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.960
I'm here today so I can hopefully
sort things out with Zahida.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.600
You look proper pissed off.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.800
Zahida's the only girl
I've ever loved,

24:57.880 --> 25:01.000
but she's also the only girl
that's ever made us lose me rag.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.960
If she got with anyone here,
it would really hurt us.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.320
I just feel devastated. If I
have to tell him what's happened,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.000
he's gonna tell us to do one.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.400
Has she done anything
since I've been away?

25:11.480 --> 25:15.320
We stayed together last night.
What did yous do?

25:16.200 --> 25:18.040
Fuck off.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.120
You shagged her?
Straight up, yeah.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.200
You're a s...

25:21.280 --> 25:22.920
(sighs)

25:23.760 --> 25:26.280
I fucking do not even
wanna look at her.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.680
I knew. I knew!

25:27.760 --> 25:29.880
You're a little slag. I knew it!
No.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.480
You are! You are!

25:31.560 --> 25:33.960
Fuck!
He's not happy.

25:34.040 --> 25:37.280
You've turned up on a fucking beach,
and on the first night,

25:37.360 --> 25:38.800
you've shagged someone.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.880
(yells)

25:39.960 --> 25:42.520
Fucking hell.
You are the one who ended things.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.800
You just told me you shagged someone.
I couldn't give a fuck!

25:45.880 --> 25:48.440
I'd be fucked off,
but this guy is fucking off it.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.720
I'm not kidding, you've fucked it.
No!

25:50.800 --> 25:53.080
You will never have me ever again.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.600
What did you come here for?
To find out what you've done, right?

25:56.680 --> 26:00.720
|And then, if you've done something,
you can have him. He's all yours.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.200
It's gone so bad.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.240
What's your name?
Maisie.

26:07.320 --> 26:08.480
Fuck off!
(laughs)

26:08.560 --> 26:10.920
Are you fucking joking?
Definitely my type.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.120
If he calms down,
maybe he can have me.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.360
Maisie, you're gorgeous, you, like.
Thank you.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.680
She's fucking rank!
What was your name?

26:18.760 --> 26:22.640
Sean, mate. No hard feelings.
Mate, it's her. It's not me.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.760
I'm so happy that
I'm not with her now.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.680
That's the idiot I've been
trying to fucking love.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.440
I'm here to have a good time, make
pals and fucking shag some lasses.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.360
See ya later.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.440
So, what do you think the craic is?
I think it's Zee's ex.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.240
I think it is as well.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.080
It's Joe! It's fucking Joe.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.120
He's here. He's out there.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
What?
What?

26:53.280 --> 26:56.640
It's not fucking funny.
I don't want to be here.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.600
This is not gonna be good, mate.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.960
Hello!

27:00.040 --> 27:01.960
Oi, oi.
What's happening, geez?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.080
All right?

27:03.160 --> 27:05.920
This guy walks in,
I don't trust him for a minute.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.640
Hi, babe. I'm Harriette.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.080
Trying to make a good impression.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.680
And Zahida thinks she can
just sit next to us.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.440
Don't sit next to me.
Fuck off. You fucking move.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.320
Go over there. Fucking idiot.

27:18.400 --> 27:21.320
Who's let her sit next to me?
Fucking hell.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.240
Oh, my God. This is gonna kick off.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.560
Yous aren't understanding...
Whys are you still talking?

27:26.640 --> 27:30.160
You fucking came and said...
Your voice just fucking grates on me.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.320
Don't touch us.
Let me fucking speak.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.360
You've had your fucking say.
You've had your shag.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.320
(laughter) You've slutted about
on the first night. Fucking idiot.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.240
Anyway...
She's an absolute nutcase. Have her.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.720
She's made her bed,
she can lie in it.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.600
I'm gonna lie in someone else's.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.320
Howay, by the way, Maisie.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.680
Hi. Sorry. You OK?
Yeah, stop...

27:50.760 --> 27:52.560
No, Maisie, do not go near Joe.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.400
Stop fucking flirting with him
in front of my face.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.520
You've been a bitch at the beach.
Fuck you, Zahida. I'm 100% in there.

28:00.240 --> 28:04.240
Talk about being desperate.
Oh, sorry, Mrs Penthouse.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.720
(laughter)

28:07.640 --> 28:10.640
'Sounds like Joe's
just getting warmed up.'

28:10.720 --> 28:14.320
'But who'll be getting burnt
when the next ex arrives?'

28:14.400 --> 28:16.480
'T-minus 15 hours.'

28:20.000 --> 28:24.240
'After Joe's dramatic arrival, it
seems love birds Ross and Harriette

28:24.320 --> 28:25.680
are getting twitchy.'

28:25.760 --> 28:27.640
You better not be psycho.
I'm not.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.120
Well, I am. But I'm not psycho
like that, as in bad psycho.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.600
'Seeing how everyone's reacted
to the exes coming in tonight,

28:34.680 --> 28:38.040
if that happens to me and Harriette,
I am slightly worried.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.000
Things are starting to get
really real with Ross.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.960
If my ex comes in now, it's gonna
literally turn things upside down.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.000
'Don't worry, you can always
rely on Alex to keep watch.'

28:52.600 --> 28:56.880
'It looks like Zahida is not letting
Joe out of her sight any time soon.'

28:57.840 --> 28:58.840
No.
Please?

28:58.920 --> 29:00.280
Get over there, please.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.680
She is the biggest nutcase
you've ever met.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.960
I couldn't think of anything worse
than talking to her now.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.080
I'm not being made to
look like a prick

29:08.160 --> 29:10.960
when you've done all this
bollocks to me. (sighs)

29:11.040 --> 29:13.960
I'm sorry. I just love you.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.800
I love you.
You don't.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.400
Yes, I fucking do.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.520
Joe, I really love you.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.240
No matter how much I try to tell him
I love him, he's not listening.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.320
I love you.
You don't.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.560
I do love you.
You don't.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.760
So, she keeps just yapping on
in me ear

29:34.840 --> 29:38.000
and I just want her to shut
the fuck up. Don't walk away.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.600
Come here.
Don't touch us.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.200
Why?
Cos I don't want you to.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.960
Maybe I need to move on and let go.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.120
But I can't.
Get off us, please.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.360
What are you doing?
Hugging you.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.840
Me heart is breaking.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.240
'Somebody needs to be rescued.'

30:04.240 --> 30:06.840
'But what could possibly
throw them a lifeline?'

30:06.920 --> 30:08.720
(tablet chimes)

30:08.800 --> 30:12.440
(all exclaim)

30:12.520 --> 30:14.760
Tablet of Terror, fuck you.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.680
"Joe, welcome to the villa.'

30:18.760 --> 30:21.960
'It's time for you and Maisie
to take it to the next level."

30:22.040 --> 30:25.400
"Enjoy the penthouse."
Fuck's sake!

30:25.480 --> 30:30.120
Yes. That's exactly what
I wanted for tonight, like.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.280
"Tablet of Terror"?
More like "Tablet of Treasure".

30:33.360 --> 30:35.840
Right, let's do this.
It's all right, Zee.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.600
Fucking hell. Right, guys.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.640
Right, have a good 'un.
See ya later.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.800
All I've done is cry tonight.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.040
And thinking about them walking
upstairs is setting us off again.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.280
Enjoy.
Bye, guys.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.680
Fuck off, you slut.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.200
(laughter)

30:52.280 --> 30:54.120
I've got no loyalties to Zahida.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.120
I'm not a slag, but fuck me,
am I gonna have a good time.

30:58.120 --> 31:01.120
Just grin and bear it, honestly.
Just grin and bear it.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.320
I'm not letting him have
a happy fucking life in here.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.720
If he's ruining mine, I'll ruin his.
And I'll ruin hers as well.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.480
(laughs)

31:09.560 --> 31:13.600
Oh, she's a fucking nutter.
She don't give a fuck, mate.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.600
Zee flips out, she's lost her head.
She's fucking nuts.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.120
I just can't deal with
another fucking nutter.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.800
It's just so hard when you've got
a girl like that downstairs.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.000
Oh, she's going in!
(screaming, laughter)

31:29.560 --> 31:31.680
What are you doing?
Hi.You OK?

31:31.760 --> 31:34.400
Are you having a fucking laugh?
Can you get out?

31:34.480 --> 31:36.640
No, I was just bringing
the plant pot in.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.720
Get out, please.
No, I'm coming in.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.680
You're not.
I am not moving.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.960
Get out.
I'm trying to fucking do me thing.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.320
Oh, he's having a hard time.
Shit, mate.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.280
Zahida's proper losing
her fucking shit tonight.

31:52.360 --> 31:56.080
I like the girl, but when she's like
this, I can't be dealing with it.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.600
No! I'm not done!

31:58.680 --> 31:59.800
Fucking hell.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.280
If she wants to kick off,
she can do that.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.680
As long as I'm balls deep later,
I don't give a fuck. Fuck off!

32:07.920 --> 32:10.160
'With Zahida finally
out of the picture,

32:10.240 --> 32:13.360
Joe and Maisie are left to
take things to the next level.'

32:14.160 --> 32:16.520
'Surely nothing can
distract them now.'

32:16.600 --> 32:19.840
Oh, I can't see. (squeals)
'Maybe not.'

32:19.920 --> 32:21.960
My conkers, my conkers.
Go.

32:22.920 --> 32:23.960
Yes, geezer.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.960
There's absolutely no fucking way

32:27.040 --> 32:29.520
they're gonna have
a peaceful night in there.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.320
Maisie?
Maisie?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.680
Maisie!

32:34.760 --> 32:36.000
Look at them!

32:36.080 --> 32:40.440
All Maisie wants to do is get her
big, massive fanny fucking wet.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.360
She's rank.
No, they're, like, on the wall.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.600
Something's burning in the back of
my head. Oh, yeah, Zahida's eyes.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.280
And she's just lowering herself
and lowering herself

32:52.360 --> 32:55.600
in my estimations of her.
Shutting the curtains.

32:56.400 --> 32:59.640
Well, that's confirmed everything
I needed to know then.

32:59.720 --> 33:04.040
All I wanna do is cuddle him,
and he's fucking cuddling her.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.280
'After an eventful day and night,
a tired and emotional Zahida

33:12.360 --> 33:14.000
ends up in bed alone.'

33:14.080 --> 33:17.360
'Unlike Joe,
who's getting frisky with Maisie.'

33:19.080 --> 33:23.720
'And Josh, who had one last try
with the loveable Zaralena.'

33:30.720 --> 33:33.760
'Not to worry,
Ross isn't getting any either.'

33:39.280 --> 33:41.640
So, last night,
when the first ex arrived,

33:41.720 --> 33:44.920
it made me feel really unnerved
about the whole situation

33:45.000 --> 33:46.040
with me and Ross.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.480
If my ex comes in,
or his ex comes in,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.800
it could change the whole goal post.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.440
Oh, fucking hell.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.920
For things to change
with me and Harriette,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.120
she'd have to fuck something up.
I'm 100% committed to her,

33:59.200 --> 34:00.680
so I'm not gonna be the one.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.520
I wake up this morning,
and Zara's next to me...

34:04.400 --> 34:06.640
...stiff as a plank. (laughs)

34:06.720 --> 34:08.840
We was meant to have
a spoon last night.

34:08.920 --> 34:12.199
Fucking hard nut to crack. I thought
she were a nun at one point.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.719
Josh is a good looking guy.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.400
I just don't know if it's
friend zone or not.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.080
I think I need a bit more time.

34:18.159 --> 34:21.400
If a fit girl walks in,
I'd probably crack on with them.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.639
So, bring them in.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.320
Morning wood.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.239
(laughs)

34:30.000 --> 34:33.120
Had a wicked night with Maisie.
I didn't quite get the bang,

34:33.199 --> 34:35.600
but I got to feed the pony.
You're such a flirt.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.080
She had a fanny like a hippo's yawn.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.960
morning, campers.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.800
Joe's got great fingers, he's a
good kiss.What happened up there?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.800
A bit of a fondle.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.719
I am really proud of myself.
Didn't split my legs.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.239
I can just show Zahida
you don't have to get your leg over

34:52.320 --> 34:54.679
first time you meet someone.
Morning.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.200
Yesterday was a screaming match.
It's absolutely drained us.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.200
Not looking forward to breakfast.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.320
So, what did I miss?

35:01.400 --> 35:05.000
Basically, just a bit of fondling
happened last night.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.000
Finger blasting. Necking on.
(laughter)

35:11.080 --> 35:12.600
Dry humping, minus the dry.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.480
It's like he's getting
some satisfaction out of it.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.960
Who does that to someone?

35:17.040 --> 35:20.120
Aye, we didn't fuck on the
first night, unlike some.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.320
I hope you're happy about that.
I can't be arsed to argue.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.720
I haven't slept.
I just can't be bothered.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.560
He's going to regret
what he's done with Maisie.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.880
Cos let's face it,
she's fucking rank.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.600
'Zahida's pulling no punches,

35:33.680 --> 35:36.280
but who's going to find themselves
on the ropes

35:36.360 --> 35:39.400
when the next ex comes out fighting?'

35:39.480 --> 35:41.000
(evil laugh)

35:46.480 --> 35:47.880
Yes!

35:47.960 --> 35:51.480
'While Joe and Maisie continue to
rub it in Zahida's face...'

35:51.560 --> 35:53.040
There you go, babe.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.720
'...the rest of the villa
is still smiling.'

35:55.800 --> 35:58.040
'As if that's going to last.'

35:59.040 --> 36:00.560
(tablet chimes)

36:00.640 --> 36:02.400
For fuck's sake, man.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.000
That tablet needs to do one.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.240
Fuck. This fucking tablet
could change everything.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.200
"You all look so hot."

36:10.280 --> 36:13.680
"Let's give you something
to really sweat about."

36:13.760 --> 36:15.080
"Ross..."
Fucking hell.

36:15.160 --> 36:19.120
"...Josh... and Zaralena,
off to the beach for you."

36:19.200 --> 36:21.400
Nice one Tablet of Terror,
you twat.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.360
(laughter)
Show me the fucking beach!

36:24.440 --> 36:27.360
I'm hoping that it's one of
Ross's exes that come in

36:27.440 --> 36:29.920
and she's a fucking rocket.
I knew it'd be me.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.400
Let's go, babe. Come on.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.840
If a particular ex comes on,
shit is gonna hit the fan.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.360
Got nothing to worry about, anyway.
You know that, don't you?

36:40.800 --> 36:43.320
I really don't want him to
go to the beach.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.360
I'm gonna get separation issues.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.360
If I were you,
I would have at least got tongues in.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.800
Cos that coulda been the last kiss.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.440
'The Tablet of Terror
isn't all doom and gloom.'

36:57.520 --> 37:00.800
'Zahida's jumped at the chance
to escape from the villa

37:00.880 --> 37:04.000
and get a strong stud
between her thighs.'

37:04.080 --> 37:05.880
'And Sean's up for the ride, too.'

37:05.960 --> 37:09.480
After everything Zahida went
through, I'll put the charm on.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.160
Nice bum.
Make her smile.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.880
Yours is nice, too.
Give her lots of attention.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.960
But I want the attention as well.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.040
You look more scared than me.
I'm fucking shitting it.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.920
(laughs) This is just
the distraction I needed.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.520
I feel like, if it wasn't for Sean,
I might have packed me bags.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.240
Why do you think you lost it
so much last night?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.320
I just don't know
where me head's at.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.520
Cos obviously I still love Joe,
but it's just so destructive.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.760
He's mugged you off enough now.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.320
And together,
you are literally just poison.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.080
You're shit together.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.640
I'll be honest with you,
one of the worst couples I've seen.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.480
Zahida definitely still has feelings
for Joe, but we just get on.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.600
We bounce off each other,
we have fun.

37:50.680 --> 37:53.960
I'd rather be here with you than
any of the other girls.Really?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.880
You give us butterflies.
Give you butterflies?Yeah.

37:56.960 --> 38:01.080
The more time I spend with Sean,
can't help but like him more.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.920
And I haven't had this feeling
since I met Joe.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.400
See, this is a better view. This is
where I should've been all day.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.680
She's got a decent arse on her,
a decent body and boobs.

38:10.760 --> 38:14.680
I wanted to take her off that horse,
squeeze her bum and just neck on.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.240
Are you just picking us up?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.760
Had a good day?
Mm-hmm. Have you?Mm.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.240
Knight in shining armour, isn't he?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.480
I'm really shitting myself, I am.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.640
Fucking hell.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.840
I've been a bit of a bad boy
in the past.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.520
So anything could fucking
walk out of that water.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.280
So, Ross, what about if it's your ex
that you're just split up from?

38:44.360 --> 38:47.840
Mate, I'd prefer you to go on a date
with her than me all day long.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.400
She could ruin everything
me and Harriette.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.760
For me, the worst ex
would be Jasmine.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.560
I'm over her, she's not over me.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.120
but she would be her
to fuck shit up.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.120
If one of your exes comes in now...

38:59.200 --> 39:02.800
He's gonna fuck shit up, isn't he?
If any ex comes on, it's drama.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.240
Me and Josh are just
starting to bond,

39:05.320 --> 39:08.720
so if Josh's ex comes on
giving me shit, I ain't taking it.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.640
You've been way too quiet
about if it's your ex.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.840
The quietest you've been the whole
time.I'm fucking shitting meself.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.080
If one of my bad exes
come out this water,

39:19.160 --> 39:21.120
I am fucking done.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.200
Not gonna lie, my head's gone.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.240
My fucking arsehole's
got his own heartbeat, mate.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.680
Josh looks like he's
about to lay a turd.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.960
If just had a nervous pump.
That's gonna smell right bad.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.640
Yes!
What's happening?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.440
How you doing, babe?
Woo!

39:58.520 --> 40:01.160
She's a good ex,
but I'm still a bit nervous here.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.040
Cos I don't know how Nicole
is gonna be with me.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.640
So, how are you anyway?

40:07.320 --> 40:10.840
Not too bad.
Oh, my God. She's a worldie.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.640
This could change things a lot.
