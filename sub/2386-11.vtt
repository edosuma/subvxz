00:00.314 --> 00:03.064
<i>In the fall of 2011,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall received</i>

00:03.065 --> 00:05.098
<i>a surprising gift</i>
<i>from Lily's grandparents:</i>

00:05.100 --> 00:06.850
<i>their house in Long Island.</i>

00:06.852 --> 00:10.820
<i>Lily and Marshall decided to</i>
<i>sell it for one simple reason.</i>

00:10.822 --> 00:12.188
It's Long Island.

00:12.190 --> 00:14.574
I don't want to spend
my Saturday in Long Island.

00:14.576 --> 00:15.859
I know, babe,

00:15.861 --> 00:17.944
but the realtor staged the
place with fake furniture

00:17.946 --> 00:20.330
and she wants us to check it
out before the open house.

00:20.332 --> 00:21.348
All right.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.366
Can we at least do it
on the fake bed?

00:23.368 --> 00:26.336
I'm embarrassed
that you have to ask.

00:26.338 --> 00:28.371
<i>So, they headed out</i>
<i>to Long Island,</i>

00:28.373 --> 00:31.274
<i>and when they walked</i>
<i>in the door...</i>

00:31.276 --> 00:33.076
We'll take it!

00:33.078 --> 00:34.427
We-We can't take it.

00:34.429 --> 00:36.262
We're the ones selling it.

00:36.264 --> 00:38.431
We are selling it, right?

00:38.433 --> 00:40.517
Baby, your grandparents gave
you this house outright.

00:40.519 --> 00:42.585
So, the way I see it,
we have five options.

00:42.587 --> 00:43.686
One: sell it.

00:43.688 --> 00:45.889
Two: year-round
haunted house.

00:45.891 --> 00:49.926
Three: giant fence around the
perimeter, chimp sanctuary.

00:49.928 --> 00:51.260
There's already a tire
swing in the backyard.

00:51.262 --> 00:53.563
Four: we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

00:53.565 --> 00:55.281
I like four.

00:55.283 --> 00:58.701
Or five: we move in,
raise our children

00:58.703 --> 01:00.770
and make this our family home.

01:00.772 --> 01:03.123
Till they graduate.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.992
Then we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

01:05.994 --> 01:08.795
As a family.

01:08.797 --> 01:10.747
No, this is crazy!

01:10.749 --> 01:11.998
We are New York people.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.617
We have a big, beautiful
apartment that we love.

01:14.619 --> 01:15.718
You're right.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.120
<i>But something happened</i>

01:17.122 --> 01:18.505
to Lily and Marshall that day.

01:18.507 --> 01:20.306
<i>Something that happens</i>
<i>to all New Yorkers</i>

01:20.308 --> 01:23.143
<i>who return home from anywhere</i>
<i>other than New York.</i>

01:23.145 --> 01:25.979
Their big, lovely apartment...

01:25.981 --> 01:27.847
Huh. That's weird.

01:29.466 --> 01:31.684
<i>...shrank.</i>

Okay, after Thanksgiving,
I'm cutting out carbs.

02:01.735 --> 02:04.277
Now, kids, it had been
a rough couple weeks for Barney.

02:04.782 --> 02:06.949
<i>First, he cheated</i>
<i>on his girlfriend with Robin,</i>

02:06.951 --> 02:08.851
<i>then he broke up</i>
<i>with his girlfriend for Robin,</i>

02:08.853 --> 02:10.752
<i>then Robin chose Kevin</i>
<i>over him.</i>

02:10.753 --> 02:13.038
<i>So he was kind of</i>
<i>in a bad place.</i>

02:13.040 --> 02:14.306
Hey.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.424
You all right?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.925
Why wouldn't I
be all right?

02:16.927 --> 02:18.176
Barney's single again!

02:18.178 --> 02:20.045
It's what America's
been clamoring for.

02:20.047 --> 02:21.730
You just went
through a break-up.

02:21.732 --> 02:23.315
That's usually when people
do something crazy.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.234
If you were a girl,
you'd have cut bangs

02:25.236 --> 02:27.185
and be dating you by now.

02:27.187 --> 02:29.187
Just promise me
you won't do something crazy.

02:29.189 --> 02:31.440
I promise I won't
do something crazy.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.092
<i>Don't worry, he's gonna do</i>
<i>something crazy.</i>

02:34.094 --> 02:36.745
In fact, I think
I'm done with girls.

02:36.747 --> 02:38.730
I'm not sure I even
like them anymore.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.415
Based on all the stuff you've
done to them over the years,

02:40.417 --> 02:41.500
I'm not sure
you ever liked them.

02:41.502 --> 02:43.368
I'm serious.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.586
Come on, you love girls.

02:44.588 --> 02:46.738
If anyone should be
done with girls, it's me.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.239
Look at the year I've had.

02:48.241 --> 02:50.175
Zoey, Victoria,
the Slutty Pumpkin.

02:50.177 --> 02:52.594
Now I'm worried
you're gonna do something crazy.

02:52.596 --> 02:54.429
I'm not gonna do
something crazy.

02:54.431 --> 02:58.433
<i>And yes, I'm gonna do</i>
<i>something crazy, too.</i>

02:58.435 --> 03:00.235
But girls, man.

03:00.237 --> 03:01.603
Girls.

03:01.605 --> 03:04.189
- You know what would kick ass?
- Being gay?

03:04.191 --> 03:06.525
Being gay would kick ass!

03:06.527 --> 03:08.360
Word. Guys understand
each other.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.978
Imagine a relationship where,

03:09.980 --> 03:11.947
instead of talking
about feelings all the time,

03:11.949 --> 03:14.432
you just play some <i>Madden,</i>
eat a pizza,

03:14.434 --> 03:16.234
give each other a happy,
roll over

03:16.236 --> 03:17.869
and have some
cuddle-free shut-eye.

03:17.871 --> 03:19.237
Bro, for what it's worth,

03:19.239 --> 03:22.491
if we were both gay,
you'd be my first call.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.459
Would you mind calling Marshall
and telling him that?

03:24.461 --> 03:25.494
'Cause he thinks...

03:25.496 --> 03:27.112
No, this is only in a scenario

03:27.114 --> 03:29.414
where just you and I are gay,
not Marshall.

03:29.416 --> 03:30.949
But if all three of us were gay,

03:30.951 --> 03:32.634
you'd pick me
over Marshall, right?

03:32.636 --> 03:34.436
If all three of us were gay?

03:34.438 --> 03:38.307
Girlfriend, we would
all three of us have some fun.

03:38.309 --> 03:40.342
Damn right we would.

03:42.512 --> 03:44.596
We're not gay.

03:44.598 --> 03:46.848
Nope. Stuck with girls.

03:47.901 --> 03:49.217
I wish men could have children

03:49.219 --> 03:50.736
on their own, like sea horses.

03:50.738 --> 03:52.487
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

03:52.489 --> 03:53.488
They have a little pouch.

03:53.490 --> 03:54.906
They should be called
sea kangaroos.

03:54.908 --> 03:57.743
No, y-you want kids?

03:57.745 --> 04:00.979
Maybe I've kind of
lately been thinking

04:00.981 --> 04:04.249
about the whole
wife and kids thing.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.034
Just minus the wife.

04:06.036 --> 04:07.652
You could always go it alone.

04:07.654 --> 04:09.821
Like Mr. Drummond
on <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

04:09.823 --> 04:12.958
Yeah, but that was the '80s,
when you could just swing by

04:12.960 --> 04:14.793
any inner-city playground
in your limo

04:14.795 --> 04:16.178
and scoop up some kids.
- Mmm.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.346
- Simpler times.
- Hmm.

04:18.349 --> 04:19.664
I guess it's better
to have someone

04:19.666 --> 04:21.433
in it with you anyway, you know?
Lifetime partnership.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.135
The only partnership in my life

04:23.137 --> 04:25.470
that has stood the test of time
is this one.

04:25.472 --> 04:28.306
The sacred bond of man and bro.

04:28.308 --> 04:31.009
Maybe we should start
a family together.

04:34.781 --> 04:36.114
Are you kidding?

04:36.116 --> 04:37.983
This place is huge.

04:37.985 --> 04:40.736
I mean, look, I can
dance all crazy in here.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.371
Oh! Sh...

04:43.039 --> 04:45.374
Listen, um, Robin,

04:45.376 --> 04:47.325
are you okay with us all

04:47.327 --> 04:49.378
doing Thanksgiving
out in East Meadow?

04:49.380 --> 04:50.912
Uh, yeah, I guess
that'd be nice.

04:50.914 --> 04:52.080
Oh, great!

04:52.082 --> 04:54.249
And then after Thanksgiving,
Lily and I were thinking

04:54.251 --> 04:56.367
that we would just
stay at the house

04:56.369 --> 04:58.303
until, you know...

04:58.305 --> 04:59.871
we die.

04:59.873 --> 05:01.089
What?

05:01.091 --> 05:02.674
No!

05:02.676 --> 05:05.060
You can't move
to Long Island!

05:05.062 --> 05:07.012
But this house
is so nice.

05:07.014 --> 05:10.932
It's big, and it's clean,
and if there's cockroaches,

05:10.934 --> 05:13.518
they respect us enough
to sneak around.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.603
Listen to yourself.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.055
This is Pregnancy Brain
all over again.

05:17.057 --> 05:18.824
No, I'm done
with Pregnancy Brain.

05:18.826 --> 05:22.911
I've moved on
to weird pregnancy sex dreams.

05:22.913 --> 05:24.496
Officer.

05:25.248 --> 05:27.699
You know. You know.

05:27.701 --> 05:32.170
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not
in the right mind to be making

05:32.172 --> 05:33.288
this decision
right now.

05:33.290 --> 05:34.923
You know what? Robin's right.

05:34.925 --> 05:38.076
We are in no state of mind
to make this kind of decision.

05:38.078 --> 05:40.629
Thank you. And now you're
stepping off the crazy bus.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.180
We let the universe decide.

05:42.182 --> 05:43.632
And now you're back on board.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.217
You hear that, Universe?

05:45.219 --> 05:48.553
If you send us a sign
in the next...

05:48.555 --> 05:51.640
24 hours, then we're moving
to Long Island!

05:51.642 --> 05:53.358
Okay?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.276
Go.

05:54.278 --> 05:55.426
Hey, guys,

05:55.428 --> 05:57.145
for the last time,
this place is enormous--

05:57.147 --> 05:58.146
Oh!

05:58.148 --> 06:00.532
Geez, how many lamps
do you have?

06:01.567 --> 06:02.784
It's genius!

06:02.786 --> 06:05.370
Instead of throwing away
your life marrying some girl,

06:05.372 --> 06:08.623
you just go splitsies on a kid
with your best bro!

06:08.625 --> 06:09.708
I wouldn't have to choose

06:09.710 --> 06:11.609
between dating
and having a family.

06:11.611 --> 06:14.279
Hell, I could bring
the kids on dates!

06:14.281 --> 06:15.464
And a broken home?

06:15.466 --> 06:16.748
Um, what's that?

06:16.750 --> 06:17.883
Our kids will never know,

06:17.885 --> 06:19.450
'cause we're never
gonna split up!

06:19.452 --> 06:20.469
Why would we?

06:20.471 --> 06:21.887
I mean, sure,
when your wife walks in

06:21.889 --> 06:23.955
on you banging a hot flight
attendant, you get a divorce.

06:23.957 --> 06:25.623
But when your bro-parent
walks in on you

06:25.625 --> 06:26.958
banging a hot
flight attendant...

06:26.960 --> 06:29.227
You get five of these bad boys,
right up high!

06:29.229 --> 06:32.147
And you totally
join in, right?!

06:32.149 --> 06:33.965
Oh, no, there's the line.
That's the line.

06:33.967 --> 06:36.067
We found the line.
It's good we know where it is.

06:36.069 --> 06:37.102
Hey, guys.

06:37.104 --> 06:38.487
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:38.489 --> 06:40.622
We have an announcement.

06:40.624 --> 06:42.524
So what you're
saying is,

06:42.526 --> 06:44.743
if you're meant to move
to Long Island,

06:44.745 --> 06:46.111
some sign from the universe

06:46.113 --> 06:47.746
will magically appear
at your doorstep?

06:47.748 --> 06:49.865
<i>Now, kids, I don't think</i>
<i>there was a knock on the door</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:52.434
<i>at that exact moment, but for</i>
<i>the purposes of this story...</i>

06:55.988 --> 06:57.255
Hi, I'm Clive.

06:57.257 --> 06:58.673
I live upstairs from you.

06:58.675 --> 07:00.759
Is this your sign?

07:00.761 --> 07:03.795
I don't know, Clive.

07:03.797 --> 07:05.163
Is it?

07:05.165 --> 07:07.015
Oh, did we leave that outside?

07:07.017 --> 07:09.634
Yeah, we're selling our house
in Long Island.

07:09.636 --> 07:11.803
Oh. Too bad you're not
selling this place.

07:11.805 --> 07:13.555
I'd love to turn
mine into a duplex.

07:13.557 --> 07:15.673
And I'd give you a really
good price for it,

07:15.675 --> 07:17.742
because I am so rich.

07:19.228 --> 07:20.712
He did not
say that.

07:20.714 --> 07:22.113
His shoes did.

07:22.115 --> 07:24.449
Okay, the point is,
we got the sign.

07:24.451 --> 07:26.735
We're moving to East Meadow.

07:27.453 --> 07:28.570
Let's get some champagne.

07:28.572 --> 07:30.238
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall</i>

07:30.240 --> 07:31.873
<i>were beginning a new chapter</i>
<i>in their lives.</i>

07:31.875 --> 07:34.042
<i>Which meant only one thing</i>
<i>for us...</i>

07:34.044 --> 07:35.911
We're having a baby!

07:35.913 --> 07:37.695
Bro-parents activate!

07:43.067 --> 07:45.052
- Hey, let's talk baby names!
- Barney...

07:45.053 --> 07:46.903
Oh, my God!
That was my first choice, too.

07:46.905 --> 07:50.306
No, listen.
You and I are drunk.

07:50.308 --> 07:53.910
Which means there's a chance
that adopting a baby--

07:53.912 --> 07:56.112
no matter how cute
he is in my head

07:56.114 --> 07:59.282
with his little cowboy outfit on
and he's riding our dog

07:59.284 --> 08:01.834
like a horse
and we also have a dog,

08:01.836 --> 08:04.620
purebred Golden,
but it's okay, she's a rescue--

08:04.622 --> 08:06.422
might not be a good idea.

08:06.424 --> 08:08.458
You're right.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.594
So let's go home,
take some aspirin,

08:11.596 --> 08:13.829
drink lots of water,

08:13.831 --> 08:16.883
and then see if it's still
a good idea tomorrow.

08:17.551 --> 08:18.801
It's still a good idea!

08:18.803 --> 08:20.386
It's totally still
a good idea!

08:20.388 --> 08:21.721
We're having a baby!

08:23.308 --> 08:25.558
<i>Kids, I cannot</i>
<i>stress this enough:</i>

08:25.560 --> 08:28.194
<i>Barney and I were going</i>
<i>through a tough time.</i>

08:28.196 --> 08:30.513
You're not leaving,
and that's final.

08:30.515 --> 08:34.517
Look what I bought at
4:00 a.m. in New York City.

08:34.519 --> 08:39.155
A bootleg VHS of a very,
very popular Korean movie,

08:39.157 --> 08:42.024
this genuine Lenny Vintone purse

08:42.025 --> 08:45.194
and the number of a man
who can get me a kidney.

08:45.196 --> 08:46.579
Do that on Long Island.

08:46.581 --> 08:49.749
Look, Robin, we appreciate
that you want us

08:49.751 --> 08:52.335
to stay in the city, but
this is what we want.

08:52.337 --> 08:53.886
I mean, you
understand, right?

08:55.206 --> 08:56.305
No.

08:56.307 --> 08:57.890
Here are a
few fun facts

08:57.892 --> 09:00.093
about Long Island.

09:00.095 --> 09:02.812
Number one:
it's Brooklyn's fart trail.

09:03.713 --> 09:04.880
<i>So Barney and I--</i>

09:04.882 --> 09:06.715
<i>and again,</i>
<i>going through a tough time,</i>

09:06.717 --> 09:08.067
<i>can't stress that enough--</i>

09:08.069 --> 09:09.769
<i>found an adoption agency</i>
<i>Web site</i>

09:09.771 --> 09:11.988
<i>and filled out</i>
<i>their online application.</i>

09:11.990 --> 09:14.774
Name: Barney Stinson.

09:14.776 --> 09:16.609
Ted Mosby.

09:16.611 --> 09:17.577
Address...

09:17.579 --> 09:19.078
Oh, put my address
in Westchester.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.363
They'll want to see we'll be

09:20.365 --> 09:21.998
raising this child
in a good environment.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.166
You know, the suburbs.

09:23.168 --> 09:24.500
What? No.

09:24.502 --> 09:27.203
- All my guys are here.
- Your guys?

09:27.205 --> 09:29.005
Yeah. You know how I got
a guy for everything?

09:29.007 --> 09:30.289
Well, they're all in New York.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.375
My suit guy, my shoe guy,
my ticket guy, my club guy.

09:32.377 --> 09:33.909
And if I don't have
a guy for something,

09:33.911 --> 09:35.711
then I have a guy guy
to get me a guy.

09:35.713 --> 09:37.547
And oddly enough,
his name is Guy.

09:37.549 --> 09:39.415
Okay, fine.
How about this?

09:39.417 --> 09:42.251
We stay in the city during
the week, then on the weekend,

09:42.253 --> 09:43.553
country house in the burbs!

09:43.555 --> 09:46.055
This is why bro-parenting works!

09:46.057 --> 09:46.973
Totally!

09:46.975 --> 09:49.225
And with your salary
plus my salary,

09:49.227 --> 09:51.260
we can totally
afford two places.

09:51.262 --> 09:53.279
Oh.

09:53.281 --> 09:54.547
What?

09:54.549 --> 09:58.818
So... uh, you're gonna
keep your job?

10:00.103 --> 10:02.538
Robin, this discussion
is closed.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.957
The universe told us to do it,
so we're doing it.

10:04.959 --> 10:08.077
Well, the universe
gets it wrong sometimes.

10:08.079 --> 10:10.329
Remember when Marshall
was trying to decide between

10:10.331 --> 10:12.915
becoming an environmental lawyer
and working at a bank?

10:12.917 --> 10:14.650
<i>That's a funny story.</i>

10:14.652 --> 10:17.086
<i>Marshall was fed up</i>
<i>with his job at GNB and was</i>

10:17.088 --> 10:18.421
<i>thinking about</i>
<i>leaving it all behind,</i>

10:18.423 --> 10:20.456
<i>so he and Lily agreed</i>
<i>he should wait for a sign</i>

10:20.458 --> 10:22.308
<i>from the universe</i>
<i>to tell him what to do.</i>

10:22.310 --> 10:24.010
<i>Then one day...</i>

10:33.237 --> 10:34.353
Of course.

10:34.355 --> 10:35.521
It's so clear.

10:35.523 --> 10:37.240
It's been right there all along.

10:37.242 --> 10:38.974
I have to call Lily.

10:38.976 --> 10:41.110
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

10:41.112 --> 10:44.163
I'm sorry, but, um, can
I please borrow your...

10:44.948 --> 10:46.949
- Ernie Hudson?
- Yes.

10:46.951 --> 10:49.085
Can I borrow your phone?

10:49.087 --> 10:51.320
Who you gonna call?

10:53.156 --> 10:55.508
And did Marshall
become a Ghostbuster?

10:55.510 --> 10:57.577
That firehouse
is still for sale.

10:57.579 --> 11:00.496
Even Ernie Hudson begged you
not to go through with that.

11:00.498 --> 11:01.797
Ernie Hudson is a coward!

11:01.799 --> 11:03.466
Oh!

11:03.468 --> 11:04.700
Of course I'm gonna
keep my job.

11:04.702 --> 11:05.868
Why wouldn't
I keep my job?

11:05.870 --> 11:09.939
Well, I mean,
this whole architecture thing...

11:09.941 --> 11:11.557
isn't it more of a hobby?

11:11.559 --> 11:13.025
Excuse me?

11:13.027 --> 11:14.644
And now we're fighting.
You know what?

11:14.646 --> 11:16.295
Forget I said anything.

11:16.297 --> 11:18.731
No! No, no, no.
We're having this discussion.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.015
Architecture
is my life's work.

11:20.017 --> 11:21.951
Why don't you quit <i>your</i> job?
I don't even know

11:21.953 --> 11:23.703
what it is
you do for a living.

11:23.705 --> 11:26.122
"What it is I do for a living?"

11:26.124 --> 11:31.244
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day
so that our baby can have food

11:31.246 --> 11:33.496
and clothes and a nice house,

11:33.498 --> 11:35.364
while you sit around
doodling pictures of buildings.

11:35.366 --> 11:36.883
That's "what it is I do."

11:36.885 --> 11:39.502
You know what? Screw this.
I'm gonna go to the bar.

11:39.504 --> 11:41.304
Yeah, right, right,
'cause the answer's always

11:41.306 --> 11:43.172
at the bottom of a bottle!

11:43.174 --> 11:45.975
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold it!

11:45.977 --> 11:48.928
Brainstorm.
Brainstorm.

11:48.930 --> 11:51.664
Nobody quits their job.

11:51.666 --> 11:52.765
We get a nanny.

11:52.767 --> 11:53.766
Dibs on the nanny.

11:53.768 --> 11:55.151
No. No banging the nanny.

11:55.153 --> 11:57.186
Ted, please don not dig in
on this whole

11:57.188 --> 11:58.237
no-banging-the-nanny policy.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.822
Okay, fine.
We'll get two nannies.

11:59.824 --> 12:02.241
One for banging,
one for childcare.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.226
Slash banging.
Dibs on both nannies!

12:04.228 --> 12:06.362
Just think of it, Ted,
you and me,

12:06.364 --> 12:08.664
living together,
with our kid,

12:08.666 --> 12:11.137
my two hot nannies,
our pet cobra...

12:11.138 --> 12:11.748
What?

12:11.753 --> 12:14.086
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted.
Don't be a pill about this.

12:14.088 --> 12:16.422
And we'll have amazing
weeklong parties,

12:16.424 --> 12:19.292
and there'll be swords
and ninja stars lying around.

12:19.294 --> 12:20.626
<i>That's when I realized:</i>

12:20.628 --> 12:23.679
adopting a baby with a friend?
<i>Crazy.</i>

12:23.681 --> 12:27.583
<i>Adopting a baby with Barney?</i>
<i>Freaking nuts.</i>

12:27.585 --> 12:29.802
I can't adopt a baby with you,
Barney.

12:29.804 --> 12:30.853
Why not?

12:30.855 --> 12:32.471
Because we don't even
have one yet

12:32.473 --> 12:33.940
and you're already
a terrible father.

12:33.942 --> 12:36.058
Oh, I get it.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.977
You want one of the nannies.

12:37.979 --> 12:39.928
Well, you can't have 'em!
They're mine!

12:39.930 --> 12:42.815
So you're just gonna have
to get yourself a third nanny.

12:42.817 --> 12:45.651
Except dibs on
the third nanny! Good day!

12:47.070 --> 12:48.704
<i>Which brings us</i>
<i>to Thanksgiving.</i>

12:48.706 --> 12:50.990
<i>Marshall, Lily and Robin</i>
<i>were heading out</i>

12:50.992 --> 12:52.959
<i>to Long Island early</i>
<i>to get ready.</i>

13:00.668 --> 13:02.301
Okay, how is this
even possible?!

13:02.303 --> 13:05.221
'Cause how did we even get it
in here?!

13:07.925 --> 13:10.292
Okay, I change my mind.
I want an epidural.

13:10.294 --> 13:12.561
You guys are crazy.

13:12.563 --> 13:14.930
This place is enormous.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.482
I mean, look arou...

13:16.484 --> 13:19.185
Have you never heard
of overhead lighting?!

13:22.856 --> 13:24.607
You're right.

13:24.609 --> 13:26.192
I get it.

13:26.194 --> 13:29.278
This place is great.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.831
Um, excuse me.
Where is the restroom?

13:31.833 --> 13:34.450
Oh. Right there.
Oh, good, great.

13:34.452 --> 13:36.002
I'm just gonna go
in there and...

13:36.004 --> 13:39.255
not come out until you promise
never to move away!

13:41.174 --> 13:43.509
It's a good thing
we have three bathrooms.

13:45.045 --> 13:46.462
Hey, Barney.

13:46.464 --> 13:48.163
Uh, listen, sorry
about the other day

13:48.165 --> 13:50.099
when I said you'd be
a terrible father.

13:50.101 --> 13:52.385
You had no reason
to think otherwise.

13:52.387 --> 13:53.886
Totally understandable.
I'm not mad.

13:53.888 --> 13:55.021
Thanks.

13:55.023 --> 13:56.155
And, uh, let's be honest,

13:56.157 --> 13:57.606
we were both acting
a little crazy.

13:57.608 --> 13:59.642
I don't think either of us
is truly ready

13:59.644 --> 14:01.176
for the responsibility of...

14:01.178 --> 14:03.729
Daddy's home.

14:09.839 --> 14:13.054
Uh, Barney, uh, where
did you get this baby?

14:13.506 --> 14:14.527
Please.

14:14.528 --> 14:15.777
Did you adopt it?

14:15.779 --> 14:16.828
Please.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.130
Do you have
a baby guy?

14:19.132 --> 14:22.417
Did Guy the guy guy
get you a baby guy?

14:22.419 --> 14:24.151
Ted, we should get going.

14:24.153 --> 14:26.504
No, no, no. I'm not going
anywhere with you.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.989
For all I know, I could be

14:27.991 --> 14:29.257
aiding and abetting
a kidnapping.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.042
Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.

14:31.044 --> 14:35.680
He's just being a wittle loud.
He wuvs you! Yes, he does!

14:35.682 --> 14:37.832
- This is insane!
- You'll feel better outside.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.717
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

14:39.719 --> 14:41.302
Yeah. Na-na-na.

14:41.304 --> 14:44.639
<i>But then we went outside.</i>

14:44.641 --> 14:45.890
Oh, my goodness.

14:45.892 --> 14:47.892
- What a beautiful baby.
- Thank you.

14:47.894 --> 14:50.177
By the way, my friend and I,
we're not a couple.

14:50.179 --> 14:52.146
We are two straight guys
who are single

14:52.148 --> 14:54.315
and we have a baby.
Just so you know.

14:54.317 --> 14:56.618
Look at this sweet girl.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.620
Hi. I was just telling
this first girl,

14:58.622 --> 15:00.455
my friend and I,
both straight,

15:00.457 --> 15:02.540
both available,
and we have a baby.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.042
Oh, who is this little angel?

15:04.044 --> 15:05.326
me and him,

15:05.328 --> 15:06.911
not gay, single,
have a baby.

15:06.913 --> 15:08.563
We should look
into having a sign made.

15:08.565 --> 15:10.782
<i>Kids, again, we were going</i>
<i>through a difficult time.</i>

15:10.784 --> 15:12.100
But this part was kind of fun.

15:12.102 --> 15:16.671
Aw...!
So cute!

15:16.673 --> 15:18.506
This is awesome.

15:18.508 --> 15:20.875
Right?

15:20.877 --> 15:22.894
Robin, come out
and talk to us.

15:22.896 --> 15:24.429
I'm not coming out
of this bathroom

15:24.431 --> 15:27.048
until everyone stops
acting crazy!

15:27.050 --> 15:29.067
No one is being crazy.

15:29.069 --> 15:31.085
<i>Again, for the purposes</i>
<i>of this story...</i>

15:32.154 --> 15:35.773
Ted and I have
a baby. Crazy!

15:35.775 --> 15:37.358
What the hell is that?

15:37.360 --> 15:40.662
Guys, this is Hurricane
Stinson-Mosby.

15:40.664 --> 15:41.829
Mosby-Stinson.

15:41.831 --> 15:44.165
You named your
baby Hurricane?

15:44.167 --> 15:46.167
That is...

15:46.169 --> 15:48.620
ultimately inconsiderate
to the child

15:48.622 --> 15:50.505
who has to live
with that name.

15:50.507 --> 15:53.258
Okay, how the hell
does Barney have a baby?

15:53.260 --> 15:54.575
No idea. Super confused.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.911
I'm finding it best
to just sort of go with it.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.180
She's super cute,
though, right?

15:59.748 --> 16:01.432
Wait a minute.

16:01.434 --> 16:05.586
Oh, guh! Hurricane
dookied in her drawers.

16:05.588 --> 16:08.973
Ha-ha!
Poopy pants!

16:08.975 --> 16:10.591
She needs
a new diaper.

16:10.593 --> 16:12.527
Right. Where do you
keep your diapers?

16:12.529 --> 16:13.811
We don't have any.

16:13.813 --> 16:15.229
You don't... Wow.

16:15.231 --> 16:19.117
Okay. (scoffs) I guess
I'll go buy some.

16:19.119 --> 16:21.653
You're gonna be a mom and
you don't have any diapers?

16:21.655 --> 16:24.656
Lord, watch over
that child.

16:24.658 --> 16:26.391
Uh, okay.

16:26.393 --> 16:28.943
Come here, you.

16:28.945 --> 16:32.797
So, there was talk
of a cheese plate?

16:41.223 --> 16:42.423
Hey.

16:42.425 --> 16:44.842
Cheese?

16:44.844 --> 16:46.394
Thanks.

16:49.315 --> 16:51.599
If you don't mind
me asking...

16:51.601 --> 16:53.818
what-what is
this all about?

16:53.820 --> 16:57.438
I mean, you are one of the most
strong, independent,

16:57.440 --> 16:59.640
non-locking-themselves-in-

16:59.642 --> 17:01.659
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving
people I know.

17:02.578 --> 17:05.313
Why-why are you so upset
about us moving?

17:05.315 --> 17:08.782
Maybe I just need you guys
more than you think.

17:08.785 --> 17:13.237
Is this about more
than us moving?

17:13.239 --> 17:15.506
This is good cheese.

17:16.842 --> 17:18.576
Robin?

17:18.578 --> 17:20.377
Yeah?

17:20.380 --> 17:23.013
Do you think I should've become
a Ghostbuster?

17:23.016 --> 17:25.098
I think you made
the right call, buddy.

17:26.352 --> 17:29.854
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you
where Barney got this baby.

17:29.856 --> 17:32.173
But do you have any idea why?

17:32.175 --> 17:34.525
Well, a few nights ago,
we were talking...

17:34.527 --> 17:37.729
you know, "We hate girls,
we wish we were gay,"

17:37.731 --> 17:39.513
just guy stuff.

17:39.515 --> 17:42.483
And we kind of
sort of decided to...

17:42.485 --> 17:44.035
adopt a baby.

17:44.037 --> 17:45.820
Yeah, that's crazy.

17:45.822 --> 17:47.038
I know.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.039
Is it, though?

17:48.041 --> 17:49.073
Yes.

17:49.075 --> 17:50.074
I know.

17:50.076 --> 17:51.542
But is it, though?

17:51.544 --> 17:52.543
Yes.

17:52.545 --> 17:53.878
Well, so what if it's crazy?

17:53.880 --> 17:56.030
I've been ready to meet someone
to start a family with

17:56.032 --> 17:58.249
for a long time now,
and I keep not meeting her.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.885
Barney is one of my best friends
in the world, we rarely fight,

18:00.887 --> 18:03.054
and once we iron out
the whole pet cobra thing,

18:03.056 --> 18:04.806
we will be amazing dads.

18:04.808 --> 18:06.307
Why shouldn't we try this?

18:06.309 --> 18:08.542
When's the last time
you fed her?

18:08.544 --> 18:10.428
She had some root beer
on the train.

18:10.430 --> 18:12.764
Oh, Ted.
And I'm sorry,

18:12.766 --> 18:14.381
but you cannot call
a baby Hurricane.

18:14.383 --> 18:16.017
Actually, her name is Sadie.

18:16.019 --> 18:18.236
James, what are you doing here?

18:18.238 --> 18:19.771
Did Barney
not tell you

18:19.773 --> 18:21.406
that we were coming
for Thanksgiving?

18:21.408 --> 18:22.723
Uh, no.

18:22.725 --> 18:25.392
Then he probably also
did not tell you

18:25.394 --> 18:27.278
that he was babysitting
our new daughter.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.247
This is your daughter?

18:29.249 --> 18:31.032
Oh, thank God.

18:31.034 --> 18:32.834
And congratulations.

18:32.836 --> 18:34.568
Thanks. Come here.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.587
Aw...
Aw...

18:36.589 --> 18:39.257
I guess this is good-bye,
Hurri... Sadie.

18:39.259 --> 18:42.794
Your name is Hurricane.
Don't ever forget it.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.763
Go with him. Go on.

18:45.765 --> 18:46.964
Come here.
That a girl.

18:46.966 --> 18:49.100
Hey, Ted,

18:49.102 --> 18:51.185
I overheard
your little speech.

18:51.187 --> 18:52.437
It's not crazy.

18:53.188 --> 18:54.806
About ten years ago,

18:54.808 --> 18:57.775
my best friend and I
nearly did the same thing.

18:57.777 --> 19:01.062
She was single, I was single,
we both wanted a family.

19:01.064 --> 19:03.147
It made sense.

19:03.149 --> 19:04.699
But now?

19:04.701 --> 19:08.152
Every day, we thank our lucky
stars that we didn't do it.

19:08.154 --> 19:10.771
'Cause what she found
with her husband

19:10.773 --> 19:12.657
and what I found
with mine--

19:12.659 --> 19:14.959
it was worth the wait.

19:16.128 --> 19:18.045
Hurricane's
a cool name.

19:18.047 --> 19:20.882
Isn't it, Tom?

19:20.884 --> 19:22.567
The pet store
was closer,

19:22.569 --> 19:24.302
so I just got her
some wee-wee pads.

19:24.304 --> 19:25.803
Oh, I also got this.

19:25.805 --> 19:27.889
It's beef-flavored
and it's good for her teeth.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.892
James! Tom! Hey!

19:30.894 --> 19:32.293
Lily...

19:32.295 --> 19:33.794
did you get
the e-mail

19:33.796 --> 19:36.314
that I sent you
about inviting

19:36.316 --> 19:38.766
James and Tom
to Thanksgiving?

19:38.768 --> 19:41.802
I sent it to your CompuServe.
That's your main one, right?

19:42.488 --> 19:43.488
Happy Thanksgiving, bro.

19:43.490 --> 19:45.472
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hey!

19:46.358 --> 19:48.326
Let's go sit down.

19:48.328 --> 19:49.827
Hi.

19:50.829 --> 19:52.914
All right,
you got me.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.332
James is my baby guy.

19:54.334 --> 19:57.702
But these past three hours--
magical, right?

19:57.704 --> 20:00.254
We can do this!
Say we can do this.

20:00.256 --> 20:01.956
We can't do this.

20:01.958 --> 20:03.324
Sorry, dude.

20:03.326 --> 20:05.927
We got to wait
for the real thing...

20:05.929 --> 20:08.329
no matter how tough it gets.

20:11.015 --> 20:13.082
It gets pretty tough.

20:13.084 --> 20:14.935
I know it does, buddy.

20:17.087 --> 20:18.805
I have some time
before dinner, right?

20:18.807 --> 20:21.024
I'm going to go...
I'm gonna take a little walk.

20:21.026 --> 20:22.859
All right. All right.

20:25.481 --> 20:27.430
God.

20:33.254 --> 20:35.372
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.748
Are we still friends?

20:44.750 --> 20:46.716
Hope so.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.530
Good.

20:49.532 --> 20:51.299
'Cause get this.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.384
Ted almost adopted a baby.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.880
Crazy, right?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.264
Poor guy's going
through some stuff.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.749
He actually tried
to rope me into it.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.136
Can you imagine me
being someone's dad?

21:03.677 --> 21:04.976
I'm pregnant.
