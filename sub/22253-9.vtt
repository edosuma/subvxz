But don't you want to
know what my Rosebud is?

09:00.871 --> 09:02.914
You told me repeatedly
it was the nudie magazine

09:02.998 --> 09:04.624
your uncle showed you with
the three-nippled woman.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.626
- Who was she?
- I got it all.

09:06.710 --> 09:07.752
Oh, okay.

09:07.836 --> 09:09.629
Well, I'll see you around though, right?

09:09.713 --> 09:12.216
Yeah. I, um...

09:12.299 --> 09:15.093
Why did you have to make
things weird, BoJack?

09:16.553 --> 09:18.513
[car door opens, closes]

09:18.596 --> 09:20.932
I made things weird?

09:21.016 --> 09:22.809
[Mr. Peanutbutter] So if you see anything

09:22.893 --> 09:24.644
you know we need, like this biscuit warmer,

09:24.728 --> 09:26.563
you just run the laser over the barcode,

09:26.646 --> 09:27.647
- and kablamsky!
- [beep]

09:27.731 --> 09:29.066
It goes in the registry.

09:29.149 --> 09:30.608
And that way, everybody knows what I want.

09:30.692 --> 09:32.319
- And I know what I want.
- Uh...

09:32.403 --> 09:33.778
Which is what everyone wants.

09:33.862 --> 09:35.155
And it's really clear,

09:35.239 --> 09:36.781
and nobody's confused about anything.

09:36.865 --> 09:39.451
Am I crazy, or are you not into this?

09:39.534 --> 09:41.703
No, I am. It's just... [sighs]

09:41.786 --> 09:44.664
The big wedding in Nantucket,
all these presents...

09:44.748 --> 09:46.541
I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider

09:46.624 --> 09:49.044
whether I want or need a biscuit warmer,

09:49.127 --> 09:50.921
which I think is how people
end up with biscuit warmers.

09:51.004 --> 09:53.090
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

09:53.173 --> 09:54.883
Close your eyes. Come on.

09:54.966 --> 09:56.676
Okay, picture our lives together.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.054
It's a cold Sunday morning
a bunch of years from now.

09:59.137 --> 10:01.223
Maybe robots have taken
over, maybe they haven't.

10:01.306 --> 10:02.349
I don't know. It's the future.

10:02.433 --> 10:03.934
This story isn't about that.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.894
The important thing is it's Sunday morning.

10:05.977 --> 10:08.439
I brought you the paper,
fetched your slippers.

10:08.521 --> 10:11.649
You come into the kitchen...
Can you smell biscuits?

10:11.733 --> 10:14.069
- Yes.
- So can I.

10:14.152 --> 10:15.695
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

10:15.779 --> 10:17.781
Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.699
Look, if marriage stresses you out,

10:19.783 --> 10:21.326
we don't have to get married.

10:21.410 --> 10:22.827
It's not the marriage.

10:22.911 --> 10:25.497
It's the wedding and the year of build-up.

10:25.580 --> 10:26.998
So forget all that.

10:27.082 --> 10:28.208
I've done the whole big wedding thing.

10:28.292 --> 10:29.667
I don't need to do it again.

10:29.751 --> 10:31.420
Let's do something small and casual

10:31.503 --> 10:33.004
right here in town next month.

10:33.088 --> 10:35.340
Honestly, that would be amazing.

10:35.424 --> 10:37.092
But we'd have to cancel the doves,

10:37.175 --> 10:38.593
and we wouldn't be able to send out

10:38.676 --> 10:40.095
those fancy invitations you liked.

10:40.178 --> 10:42.139
Those doves were being jerks anyway.

10:42.222 --> 10:43.932
And invitations... They're just a scam

10:44.015 --> 10:46.393
made up by the Post
Office to keep tabs on us.

10:46.477 --> 10:47.602
Post Office.

10:47.685 --> 10:49.438
- [growls]
- Settle down, boy.

10:49.521 --> 10:52.565
[Todd] And then we talked about
his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

10:52.649 --> 10:54.818
[crunching] And... Oh, oh.

10:54.901 --> 10:58.113
And then that led to a whole
conversations about sticks.

10:58.196 --> 11:00.157
Oh, and let me tell you,

11:00.240 --> 11:04.411
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some
serious opinions about sticks.

11:04.495 --> 11:05.954
Why are you telling me this?

11:06.037 --> 11:07.580
What? You said you wanted every detail.

11:07.664 --> 11:09.082
Did I mention he got a new bandana?

11:09.166 --> 11:10.417
Give me something I can use

11:10.501 --> 11:11.918
to make them call off their wedding.

11:12.002 --> 11:13.504
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you?

11:13.586 --> 11:14.712
They called off their wedding.

11:14.796 --> 11:16.589
What? Thank God!

11:16.673 --> 11:18.716
Oh, the universe makes sense.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.511
They decided against a
big destination wedding,

11:20.593 --> 11:21.719
so they're doing it here

11:21.803 --> 11:22.971
- sometime next month.
- What?

11:23.096 --> 11:24.556
I guess saying they called it off

11:24.639 --> 11:25.890
is probably not right.

11:25.974 --> 11:26.975
[groans]

11:27.058 --> 11:29.227
[ominous music]

11:29.311 --> 11:30.645
Hey, what's this?

11:30.728 --> 11:32.730
Oh, yes, I got jury duty,

11:32.814 --> 11:34.065
but I can't worry about that right now.

11:34.149 --> 11:35.608
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.

11:35.692 --> 11:37.944
Now think, Todd. Gotta
have something I can use

11:38.028 --> 11:40.489
sloshing around in that
pot-infused Jell-O shot

11:40.572 --> 11:42.366
- you call a brain.
- Let's see.

11:42.449 --> 11:45.994
Mr. Peanutbutter likes
having his tummy scratched,

11:46.077 --> 11:47.996
and Diane's family is from Vietnam,

11:48.079 --> 11:51.375
which is where Vietnamese food comes from,

11:51.458 --> 11:53.751
and since that goes in your tummy...

11:53.835 --> 11:55.379
Okay, stop thinking. Just give me raw data.

11:55.462 --> 11:56.588
What's happening this week?

11:56.671 --> 11:58.298
Well, the circus is in town.

11:58.382 --> 12:00.175
Congress is going to vote
on the new Education Bill...

12:00.258 --> 12:01.593
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

12:01.676 --> 12:02.927
What's happening with Mr. Peanutbutter?

12:03.011 --> 12:05.222
Well, I'm taking Diane and him

12:05.305 --> 12:06.890
to the bank on Thursday.

12:06.973 --> 12:10.018
I can use that. I can actually use that.

12:12.270 --> 12:13.271
I don't know if I'm up

12:13.355 --> 12:15.566
for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.

12:15.648 --> 12:18.735
Oh, come on, character
actress Margo Martindale.

12:18.818 --> 12:19.944
They say that there are no good parts

12:20.028 --> 12:21.321
for women over 50.

12:21.405 --> 12:22.614
I want to stick an AK-47

12:22.697 --> 12:24.324
in your hand and prove them wrong.

12:24.408 --> 12:26.117
I do tire of the limitations

12:26.201 --> 12:27.911
of stage, film, and television.

12:27.994 --> 12:29.787
You might as well perform
in a cage, am I right?

12:29.871 --> 12:31.248
This is guerilla theater...

12:31.331 --> 12:33.333
No stage, no script, no net.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.043
It's the kind of work we talked about

12:35.126 --> 12:37.045
doing that night in the desert.

12:37.128 --> 12:39.631
Don't tell me we left those
dreams in the sweat lodge.

12:39.714 --> 12:41.592
- Hell, I'll do it.
- [dishes clatter]

12:43.051 --> 12:45.429
And that little boy never found his mother.

12:45.512 --> 12:46.471
Hey, guys.

12:46.597 --> 12:47.972
BoJack Horseman?

12:48.056 --> 12:49.349
Oh. Hi.

12:49.433 --> 12:50.642
What a weird coincidence.

12:50.725 --> 12:52.227
I did not know you would be here today.

12:52.310 --> 12:54.521
How are... things?

12:54.605 --> 12:55.897
Things are good. You?

12:55.980 --> 12:57.315
Things good with you?

12:57.399 --> 12:58.567
Hands behind your head, everybody.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.902
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

13:00.985 --> 13:03.154
- [gasps]
- What an unfortunate surprise.

13:03.238 --> 13:05.365
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

13:05.449 --> 13:06.866
- [gasps]
- [coughs] This one.

13:06.950 --> 13:09.244
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

13:09.327 --> 13:10.621
I'll take it.

13:10.703 --> 13:11.996
But it's my engagement ring.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.331
Give it to her, Diane.

13:13.415 --> 13:15.041
- It's just a ring.
- Just a ring?

13:15.125 --> 13:17.335
That ring is a symbol of your love.

13:17.419 --> 13:19.170
If you don't care about the ring,

13:19.254 --> 13:21.214
it really makes me wonder if you care about

13:21.298 --> 13:22.924
the woman wearing it.

13:23.007 --> 13:24.259
That terrifying bank robber

13:24.342 --> 13:26.219
is making some very cogent points.

13:26.303 --> 13:27.845
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

13:27.929 --> 13:30.223
If the ring is just a symbol for love,

13:30.307 --> 13:31.600
why would I need a symbol

13:31.683 --> 13:33.310
when I have the real thing right here?

13:33.393 --> 13:35.479
Yeah, we don't need
rings, we have each other.

13:35.562 --> 13:38.106
Hey, why are we even waiting
a month to get married?

13:38.189 --> 13:40.692
If anything, this bank
robbery is reminding me

13:40.775 --> 13:42.319
that life is short.

13:42.402 --> 13:43.861
We should get married even sooner!

13:43.945 --> 13:45.071
[softly] No...

13:45.155 --> 13:46.239
What do you mean sooner?

13:46.323 --> 13:47.407
Why not this weekend?

13:47.491 --> 13:49.284
We could get married Saturday.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.577
Am I crazy?

13:50.661 --> 13:52.329
[softly] Yes. Don't do it.

13:52.412 --> 13:54.956
- Oh, keep the damn thing.
- Aw.

13:55.039 --> 13:56.207
[applause]

13:56.291 --> 13:58.293
Okay. Saturday it is.

13:58.376 --> 13:59.628
What the hell just happened?

13:59.711 --> 14:01.588
Something truly beauti...

14:01.672 --> 14:02.714
Aah!

14:02.797 --> 14:03.965
- Oh.
- Get your hands off me!

14:04.048 --> 14:05.049
- [Taser
crackles] - Uh-oh.

14:05.133 --> 14:06.635
[landing blows]

14:08.761 --> 14:09.887
[laughs] Long story short,

14:10.013 --> 14:11.598
Erica did have to lose the foot,

14:11.682 --> 14:13.975
but she gained a friend.

14:14.058 --> 14:15.852
Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.395
Diane and I wanna thank you all

14:17.479 --> 14:19.814
for coming to our
impromptu rehearsal dinner,

14:19.897 --> 14:21.692
even though we did not actually have time

14:21.774 --> 14:23.943
- to organize a rehearsal.
- Or a dinner.

14:24.027 --> 14:26.237
But there is an open bar...

14:26.321 --> 14:27.698
[cheers and applause]

14:27.780 --> 14:29.324
which you are all welcome to partake in

14:29.407 --> 14:31.159
as soon as I finish this toast,

14:31.242 --> 14:34.538
which I will be doing right...

14:34.621 --> 14:35.913
after one more quick anecdote.

14:35.997 --> 14:37.374
- [guests groan]
- It was winter in Prague,

14:37.457 --> 14:39.209
and the consumption hung low in the air.

14:39.292 --> 14:40.418
Well, the bank thing was a dud.

14:40.502 --> 14:41.753
Thanks a lot, Todd.

14:41.836 --> 14:43.213
Well, you win some, you lose some.

14:43.296 --> 14:44.715
It's like Vincent always says...

14:44.797 --> 14:46.090
- "Oopsy."
- Vincent?

14:46.174 --> 14:47.509
Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

14:47.592 --> 14:49.093
We've hung out a couple times.

14:49.177 --> 14:50.887
- What are you ta...
- That dude is funny.

14:50.970 --> 14:52.597
You know he's not a person, right?

14:52.681 --> 14:53.890
Look, I don't want to get

14:53.973 --> 14:55.099
in the middle of your whole thing

14:55.183 --> 14:56.351
with Princess Carolyn.

14:56.434 --> 14:57.686
It's not about that.

14:57.769 --> 14:58.936
I just don't understand why nobody else

14:59.020 --> 15:00.480
seems to notice that she is dating a man

15:00.564 --> 15:01.939
who is clearly three little boys

15:02.023 --> 15:04.025
doing the thing from The Little Rascals.

15:04.108 --> 15:05.985
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.

15:06.069 --> 15:08.029
[clinks glass] If I could say a few words?

15:08.112 --> 15:10.365
BoJack Horseman. Take the mic.

15:10.448 --> 15:11.742
Spin us a yarn.

15:11.824 --> 15:13.368
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

15:13.451 --> 15:14.911
Since I am friends with both of you

15:14.994 --> 15:16.954
- and have no ulterior motives...
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.038 --> 15:18.373
I would like to offer my restaurant

15:18.456 --> 15:19.791
as a venue for your wedding.

15:19.874 --> 15:21.459
Wow! Really?

15:21.543 --> 15:23.420
I don't know. That's too generous.

15:23.503 --> 15:26.548
Hey, don't look a horse's
gift in the mouth, right?

15:26.631 --> 15:27.758
[laughter]

15:27.840 --> 15:29.884
I get it. Like the song.

15:29.967 --> 15:30.968
That's not a song.

15:31.052 --> 15:32.387
All right, everyone.

15:32.470 --> 15:33.638
That's it for the toasts.

15:33.722 --> 15:36.433
Enjoy yourselves and each other.

15:36.516 --> 15:38.393
[dance music plays]

15:38.476 --> 15:39.936
This is perfect.

15:40.019 --> 15:41.688
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant,

15:41.772 --> 15:43.648
we have the home field advantage.

15:43.732 --> 15:45.233
Perfect for sabotage.

15:45.316 --> 15:47.402
BoJack, I need to thank you.

15:47.485 --> 15:49.613
You calling me to the bar the other night

15:49.696 --> 15:50.905
turned out to be the best thing

15:50.988 --> 15:52.073
that ever happened to me.

15:52.156 --> 15:53.617
- I think I'm in love.
- Okay.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.201
This "person" you're in love with...

15:55.285 --> 15:56.953
Have you seen him without
his trench coat on?

15:57.036 --> 15:58.747
I don't understand why
you can't be happy for me.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.331
He's a good boyfriend.

16:00.415 --> 16:01.916
I actually think you and Vincent

16:01.999 --> 16:04.168
would really hit it off
if you gave him a chance.

16:04.252 --> 16:06.087
You should spend some
one-on-one time with him.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.505
You mean
one-on-three time?

16:07.589 --> 16:09.173
Because there are three of him.

16:09.257 --> 16:11.092
We get it. You don't like him.

16:11.175 --> 16:12.636
I'm actually not sure you do get it.

16:14.262 --> 16:16.139
- [unzips]
- I know what's been going on.

16:16.222 --> 16:17.557
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.

16:17.641 --> 16:18.975
I was just taking my penis out.

16:19.058 --> 16:20.685
You've been driving me around,

16:20.769 --> 16:22.687
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

16:22.771 --> 16:23.855
I see it now.

16:23.938 --> 16:25.774
What are you talking about?

16:25.857 --> 16:28.777
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

16:28.860 --> 16:31.362
You were becoming my friend.

16:31.446 --> 16:33.782
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

16:33.865 --> 16:35.784
Well, I could use a friend right about now.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.786
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

16:37.869 --> 16:41.414
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

16:41.498 --> 16:43.958
No, I'm not great with
sensitive information.

16:44.041 --> 16:46.002
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

16:46.085 --> 16:48.921
Don't get me wrong. I love Diane so much.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.089
I didn't have any doubts

16:50.173 --> 16:52.342
until I realized she had doubts.

16:52.425 --> 16:54.719
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.

16:54.803 --> 16:56.137
Maybe she knows things I don't.

16:56.262 --> 16:57.639
You are kind of unloading

16:57.764 --> 16:59.683
a lot of sensitive information here.

16:59.766 --> 17:01.768
Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane,

17:01.852 --> 17:04.020
but I can't even commit to
my favorite type of stick.

17:04.103 --> 17:07.357
Yes, today, it's short
and knobby, but tomorrow?

17:07.440 --> 17:10.026
Well, sure, Diane is short,
but I don't know about knobby.

17:10.108 --> 17:12.111
The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane,

17:12.194 --> 17:14.405
but I keep having this
dream where she's gone.

17:14.489 --> 17:16.115
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

17:16.199 --> 17:18.576
She's just gone, and my
life continues without her.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.328
And it terrifies me to say this,

17:20.411 --> 17:23.205
but in the dream I feel... relief.

17:23.289 --> 17:25.750
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.502
You're a really good friend, Todd.

17:27.585 --> 17:29.170
[groans]

17:29.253 --> 17:31.172
Since you weren't able to
give me any useful intel,

17:31.255 --> 17:32.924
I had to offer up my restaurant,

17:33.007 --> 17:35.176
but now, we're on my turf.

17:35.259 --> 17:37.679
Time for operation "I don't."

17:37.762 --> 17:39.556
Yeah, sounds good.

17:39.639 --> 17:40.849
You know, with my knack

17:40.932 --> 17:43.017
for coming up with plans and your ability

17:43.100 --> 17:44.435
to hear them without contributing

17:44.519 --> 17:46.145
more than three words at a time,

17:46.229 --> 17:47.898
we make a pretty good team, don't we, Todd?

17:47.980 --> 17:50.024
- You said it.
- See?

17:50.107 --> 17:51.693
[news theme playing]

17:51.776 --> 17:53.862
[newsman] Beloved character
actress Margo Martindale

17:53.945 --> 17:55.321
is in police custody tonight

17:55.405 --> 17:57.574
for her role in a failed bank robbery.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.075
Margo Martindale?

17:59.158 --> 18:01.369
But first, pizza for breakfast?

18:01.452 --> 18:03.413
The answer might surprise you.

18:03.496 --> 18:07.918
I know her, but how? Wait.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.377
She was at the convenience store

18:09.460 --> 18:11.170
the night I bought that video game

18:11.254 --> 18:13.130
and ruined my rock opera.

18:13.214 --> 18:14.883
She's the one who asked me

18:14.966 --> 18:18.010
to hand her that tape from the 10¢ bin.

18:18.094 --> 18:22.682
[gasps] That means Margo
Martindale likes tapes!

18:22.766 --> 18:24.642
And a tape is something you listen to,

18:24.726 --> 18:26.477
but tape is also a sticky thing

18:26.561 --> 18:28.438
you can use to seal boxes.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.941
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

18:32.191 --> 18:33.610
What does it all mean?

18:33.693 --> 18:35.486
Am I just grasping at straws?

18:35.570 --> 18:38.740
Wait. Straws... That's it.

18:38.823 --> 18:42.243
Straws are used to drink soda or water,

18:42.326 --> 18:43.870
and plants need water.

18:43.954 --> 18:48.332
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant

18:48.416 --> 18:53.212
at the bank and the convenience store,

18:53.296 --> 18:55.799
which means... Ugh!

18:55.882 --> 18:58.760
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

18:58.843 --> 19:00.762
to make me find that video game

19:00.845 --> 19:05.016
so he could kill my rock opera!

19:05.099 --> 19:06.517
Aw, dude.

19:09.437 --> 19:12.482
- Rise and shine, Todd.
- I didn't sleep.

19:12.565 --> 19:14.191
Well, we're down to the
wire, but we still got

19:14.275 --> 19:16.152
one more day to figure out
how to stop this wedding,

19:16.235 --> 19:18.488
and I can't afford to waste
one second, so let's get...

19:18.571 --> 19:20.490
Oh, shit. Forgot about jury duty.

19:20.573 --> 19:22.074
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

19:25.954 --> 19:30.166
- And so, you saw the defendant.
- Yes.

19:30.249 --> 19:34.045
That man, the defendant... You saw him?

19:34.128 --> 19:35.672
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up.

19:35.755 --> 19:39.634
- That's correct.
- The defendant was seen by you.

19:39.717 --> 19:40.885
Sweet Jesus.

19:40.969 --> 19:42.470
Some of us have weddings to ruin.

19:42.553 --> 19:43.721
Yes.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.389
No further questions, Your Honor.

19:45.473 --> 19:47.684
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.686
A lot of further questions.

19:49.769 --> 19:50.937
[groans]

19:56.567 --> 19:59.570
The jury finds the defendant
not guilty on all charges.

19:59.654 --> 20:00.822
[murmuring]

20:00.905 --> 20:02.657
We did the right thing today, BoJack.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.116
But you know who the real winner is?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.202
- Justice.
- Mr. Peanutbutter.

20:07.996 --> 20:09.163
[sighs]

20:09.246 --> 20:10.247
BoJack.

20:10.331 --> 20:12.333
There's my superstar.

20:12.416 --> 20:13.877
- How are you?
- Amazing!

20:13.960 --> 20:16.170
This has been the role of a lifetime.

20:16.253 --> 20:18.464
I think they're gonna send me up to Lompoc,

20:18.548 --> 20:20.842
and when I get there, I'm gonna find

20:20.925 --> 20:23.344
the meanest, hardest
queen bitch of the yard,

20:23.427 --> 20:26.056
and I'm going to bite her finger off.

20:26.138 --> 20:28.432
[laughs] That'll show everyone I'm crazy,

20:28.516 --> 20:30.060
and you don't mess with crazy.

20:30.142 --> 20:31.561
Plus, free finger.

20:31.644 --> 20:34.105
Oh, here I am blabbering on about my plans.

20:34.188 --> 20:36.148
Did you ever stop that wedding?

20:36.232 --> 20:37.567
It's actually happening right now.

20:37.650 --> 20:39.193
I ran out of time.

20:39.276 --> 20:40.611
I never understood why

20:40.695 --> 20:42.363
it was so important to
keep those two apart.

20:42.446 --> 20:43.865
I was just trying to be a good friend

20:43.948 --> 20:46.826
in my own shitty, ass-backwards way.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.578
Diane deserves the best.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.371
She's smart and kind and beautiful,

20:50.454 --> 20:52.916
and it's gonna be mostly
synonyms from here on

20:52.999 --> 20:54.751
if I keep going,

20:54.834 --> 20:56.669
and I'm in love with her.

20:56.753 --> 20:58.379
Tell her that, BoJack.

20:58.462 --> 21:01.507
You don't need kooky
schemes or nutty capers.

21:01.591 --> 21:04.719
Just go to her and speak from your heart.

21:04.802 --> 21:07.597
Then find the biggest person at the wedding

21:07.680 --> 21:09.348
and bite his finger off!

21:09.432 --> 21:11.142
You're right, partly.

21:11.225 --> 21:13.061
I've gotta tell her how I feel.

21:13.144 --> 21:14.938
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

21:15.021 --> 21:16.773
Good luck with your finger thing.

21:16.856 --> 21:19.109
[tires screech]

21:19.191 --> 21:20.234
[car alarm chirps]

21:20.317 --> 21:21.694
Todd, thank God you're here!

21:21.778 --> 21:23.029
Did I miss it? Is it too late?

21:23.113 --> 21:24.655
Dude. I'm done with this. No. No.

21:24.739 --> 21:26.449
Mr. Peanutbutter's been nice to me.

21:26.532 --> 21:27.784
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to everybody.

21:27.867 --> 21:29.243
That's what makes him so stupid.

21:29.326 --> 21:31.245
No, I'm stupid.

21:31.328 --> 21:33.623
But even I know that the only reason

21:33.706 --> 21:35.959
you're doing this is because
you're in love with Diane.

21:36.042 --> 21:37.460
Yes, that's right.

21:37.543 --> 21:39.336
And I'm here to finally
tell her how I feel.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.131
BoJack, she knows how you feel.

21:41.213 --> 21:43.174
How? I barely just realized...

21:43.257 --> 21:45.593
Hey, man, she made her choice.

21:45.676 --> 21:49.889
Look around. This day
is not about you, okay?

21:49.973 --> 21:52.600
So maybe you should just stop trying

21:52.683 --> 21:55.728
to mess with other people's lives.

21:55.812 --> 21:58.314
[Diane] I never thought
I wanted to get married.

21:58.397 --> 21:59.857
It's so weird,

21:59.941 --> 22:02.026
this idea of dedicating
yourself to something

22:02.110 --> 22:03.277
for the rest of your life.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.822
Like, how could you know, right?

22:05.905 --> 22:09.325
But then I realized it's
okay to not know everything.

22:09.408 --> 22:11.702
And some things take a leap of faith.

22:11.786 --> 22:14.413
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want
to take that leap with you.

22:14.497 --> 22:17.416
By the power vested in me by
one of those dumb websites,

22:17.500 --> 22:19.085

Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

But that doesn't matter.
Not everything's about me.

date Princess Carolyn anymore,
