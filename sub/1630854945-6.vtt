00:07.670 --> 00:08.604
<i>Previously on "School Spirits"...</i>

00:08.604 --> 00:09.638
They found Maddie's backpack?

00:09.638 --> 00:10.839
Where?
- D--deserted house.

00:10.839 --> 00:12.408
Wait, you died
at the homecoming game?

00:12.408 --> 00:14.877
Yeah, and my family still
shows up for me every year.

00:14.877 --> 00:16.245
Did you say anything
about me?

00:16.245 --> 00:17.246
I don't remember.

00:17.246 --> 00:18.581
Is it hard seeing him?

00:18.581 --> 00:19.882
It's getting easier,
especially now that

00:19.882 --> 00:22.217
I'm 95% sure he didn't kill me.

00:22.217 --> 00:24.119
Win back Claire's confidence,
and then you crack her.

00:24.119 --> 00:25.754
How am I gonna do that?

00:25.754 --> 00:26.989
Tell him to ask her
to the homecoming dance.

00:26.989 --> 00:28.390
Ask her
to the homecoming dance.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.625
You're shitting me.

00:29.625 --> 00:30.526
Do you wanna go
to the dance with me?

00:30.526 --> 00:32.461
Sure, Wally.

00:32.461 --> 00:33.696
I'm guessing this is how

00:33.696 --> 00:35.965
Claire dragged your body
out of here.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.304
You what?

00:46.304 --> 00:47.738
I just can't--

00:47.738 --> 00:50.241
a football player?

00:52.009 --> 00:55.213
Shh! Keep your voice down.

00:55.213 --> 00:56.614
You waited to be dead

00:56.614 --> 00:58.382
to go to a school dance

00:58.382 --> 00:59.650
with a jock?

00:59.650 --> 01:00.685
Who are you now?

01:00.685 --> 01:01.886
I'm changing the subject.

01:01.886 --> 01:03.721
I would rather talk
about my murder

01:03.721 --> 01:05.990
and my maybe murderer,
Claire, please.

01:07.258 --> 01:08.226
Simon.

01:08.226 --> 01:09.727
That's so gross.

01:09.727 --> 01:11.629
Is it, Chloe?

01:11.629 --> 01:12.964
I mean, I just think it's gross

01:12.964 --> 01:15.166
that you're being
so judgmental.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.001
Isn't your boyfriend
the guy who's been wearing

01:17.001 --> 01:19.504
the same boat shoes
without socks

01:19.504 --> 01:20.938
since the seventh grade?

01:20.938 --> 01:23.574
And yet, I've never
brought that up.

01:23.574 --> 01:26.444
Xavier is hot and original.

01:26.444 --> 01:28.346
And he's been through a lot.

01:28.346 --> 01:30.648
Expand your horizons, ladies.

01:32.049 --> 01:35.153
And we're sure he didn't
murder his girlfriend?

01:35.153 --> 01:37.688
Yes, we're sure.

01:37.688 --> 01:39.891
Wait, I heard she ran away.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.527
Then why would her blood
be on the wall, dumbass?

01:49.600 --> 01:52.303
He has other shoes.

01:57.808 --> 01:59.010
Claire said yes.

01:59.010 --> 02:00.645
- Told you it would work.
- That's good.

02:00.645 --> 02:02.446
Shit. What now?

02:02.446 --> 02:04.649
Operation Claire--
we crack her at the dance.

02:04.649 --> 02:06.584
Operation Claire--we crack
her at the dance.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.519
Crack her?
What does that even mean?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.954
Get her to admit
what she did.

02:09.954 --> 02:11.189
The blackmail, for starters.

02:11.189 --> 02:12.390
We know she's
blackmailing Anderson

02:12.390 --> 02:13.758
for grades, right?

02:13.758 --> 02:15.726
When they got that video,
they freaked.

02:15.726 --> 02:16.994
And if Anderson didn't do it--

02:16.994 --> 02:18.329
Then Claire definitely did.

02:18.329 --> 02:20.631
We need to confirm
she took Maddie's phone

02:20.631 --> 02:22.200
and smashed it--

02:22.200 --> 02:24.835
and what else
she may have smashed,

02:24.835 --> 02:25.903
like Maddie's head.

02:25.903 --> 02:27.071
- Simon.
- Jesus. Come on.

02:27.071 --> 02:28.706
- Nice.
- What? We need the truth.

02:28.706 --> 02:30.942
Does the truth have to be
so graphic while we're eating?

02:30.942 --> 02:33.044
You need to charm Claire
into a confession

02:33.044 --> 02:34.212
and record it on your phone.

02:34.212 --> 02:36.080
Get her to admit
she dragged Maddie's body

02:36.080 --> 02:37.815
out the fallout shelter.
- Charm her?

02:37.815 --> 02:39.750
Last week she was pretending
I didn't even exist.

02:39.750 --> 02:40.918
How did that feel?

02:40.918 --> 02:42.053
I don't even know
why she said yes.

02:42.053 --> 02:43.821
Maybe she still
thinks you're hot.

02:43.821 --> 02:45.056
He's gotta look hotter.

02:45.056 --> 02:47.892
But you need to look hotter.

02:47.892 --> 02:49.694
She did ask if I had a suit.

02:49.694 --> 02:51.062
- Do you?
- No.

02:51.062 --> 02:52.597
- Well, Nicole can help.
- Nicole,

02:52.597 --> 02:54.232
take him to the mall,
find him a suit.

02:54.232 --> 02:55.333
Why, 'cause I'm a girl?

02:56.867 --> 02:58.536
- This needs something.
- Fine.

02:58.536 --> 03:00.238
Yeah.
both: Ketchup.

03:06.010 --> 03:07.411
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

03:07.411 --> 03:09.480
You mean setting up
my cheating ex-boyfriend

03:09.480 --> 03:11.582
and my traitor ex-friend?

03:11.582 --> 03:13.050
It's a great plan.

03:15.753 --> 03:17.922
Stop looking at me like that
or I'm gonna change my mind.

03:28.966 --> 03:32.336
<i>- ♪ Don't forget me

03:37.575 --> 03:41.912

04:15.379 --> 04:17.315
Is this dust or dandruff?

04:18.916 --> 04:21.319
Ghosts can have allergies.
That's good to know.

04:21.319 --> 04:23.921
Yeah, poor Charley will never
know the glory of a peanut M&M.

04:23.921 --> 04:25.022
Even dead he still swells up.

04:25.022 --> 04:26.791
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:26.791 --> 04:29.160
So are you thinking
dress or suit?

04:30.795 --> 04:32.697
- Dress.
- Well, that's a statement

04:32.697 --> 04:34.565
for a homecoming dance.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.000
Surprised you'd go frilly.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.535
That's really--

04:37.535 --> 04:40.271
I'm surprised you're going
to this thing at all.

04:40.271 --> 04:41.706
It doesn't totally track
with you.

04:41.706 --> 04:43.107
Well, how can one revolt

04:43.107 --> 04:44.275
if they've never assimilated?

04:44.275 --> 04:45.776
Weak reasoning.

04:45.776 --> 04:48.145
But I'll let it slide.

04:48.145 --> 04:49.313
I guess I'm just surprised
you guys

04:49.313 --> 04:50.581
are throwing yourselves
into this.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.116
You know, Wally's acting
like it's the first time

04:52.116 --> 04:53.150
he's ever even heard
of a dance.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.318
Yeah, well, he's been going

04:54.318 --> 04:56.454
to this thing alone
for 37 years.

04:56.454 --> 04:57.922
So brava, I suppose,

04:57.922 --> 05:00.991
for helping him tackle
this unfinished business.

05:00.991 --> 05:03.928
We don't always get
second chances on this side.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.064
I have a question,

05:07.064 --> 05:09.100
but you can't laugh.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.302
Okay, well, I can't
guarantee anything, but shoot.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.805
Can ghosts have sex?

05:16.173 --> 05:19.110
I said we can swell,
didn't I?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.078
Oh.
So you've all--

05:21.078 --> 05:22.480
<i>La grande mort</i>
is no competition

05:22.480 --> 05:24.048
for <i>la petite mort,</i>
Tootsie Roll.

05:25.649 --> 05:28.586
But yeah, we've been going
through puberty for decades.

05:28.586 --> 05:30.087
We have needs.

05:30.087 --> 05:31.956
We have a past. We all do.

05:35.459 --> 05:37.528
We all <i>do,</i> right?

05:38.863 --> 05:42.733
Maddie Nears,
did you die a virgin?

05:42.733 --> 05:45.102
Uh... hello.

05:45.102 --> 05:47.138
I just wanted to come
and check in

05:47.138 --> 05:50.141
and make sure that, um,
with everything going on,

05:50.141 --> 05:53.010
finding out that you may
have possibly been dragged

05:53.010 --> 05:54.545
through a murder tunnel
and all that,

05:54.545 --> 05:56.414
um, I wanted to see if you were
still up to go to the--

05:56.414 --> 05:57.715
I mean, are--do you--
- To go to the dance?

05:57.715 --> 05:59.049
Yeah.
- Okay, you are--

05:59.049 --> 06:01.152
You're not going
to this one alone, Wally.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.486
That's--that's awesome.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.755
And I will--I'll--

06:08.426 --> 06:09.794
No, that was cool.
That was really cool.

06:09.794 --> 06:11.629
Shut up.

06:17.501 --> 06:19.336
- Hey.
- There's a chick in here!

06:19.336 --> 06:21.305
Hey.

06:21.305 --> 06:22.306
Can we talk?

06:22.306 --> 06:23.374
In here?

06:23.374 --> 06:24.475
You might wanna
check with them.

06:24.475 --> 06:26.043
I mean,
I'm wearing clothes but--

06:26.043 --> 06:27.745
Why the text?

06:27.745 --> 06:29.380
Uh, wh--what do you mean?

06:29.380 --> 06:30.948
Why now?

06:33.617 --> 06:36.687
I mean, I--
I wrote it a while ago.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.623
I just--I figured--

06:39.623 --> 06:42.827
I felt bad about the way
I treated you, and it just--

06:42.827 --> 06:45.696
it took me a while
to press send.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.399
I guess I--

06:48.399 --> 06:50.067
I miss you.

06:50.067 --> 06:51.836
Oh, you guess.

06:51.836 --> 06:54.004
I know I miss you.

06:57.842 --> 06:59.710
Pick you up at 7:00 tomorrow.

06:59.710 --> 07:00.744
You don't want me to drive?

07:00.744 --> 07:03.447
- I wanna drive.
- You do?

07:03.447 --> 07:04.515
Why?

07:06.116 --> 07:09.954
My car has a bigger
back seat than yours.

07:18.596 --> 07:20.698
You want Simon to copy this
and give it to him?

07:20.698 --> 07:22.867
It's only 16 pages.

07:22.867 --> 07:25.269
Front and back.

07:25.269 --> 07:30.374
I mean, "I've been watching you
for the past 28 years."

07:30.374 --> 07:32.643
Charley, Mr. Figueroa--
or Emilio,

07:32.643 --> 07:34.678
he's gonna think
that you're messing with him.

07:34.678 --> 07:36.847
Yeah, I didn't--
I didn't think about that.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.048
I mean...

07:40.251 --> 07:42.553
He's in his what now, 40s?

07:42.553 --> 07:43.721
And isn't he married
to some guy?

07:43.721 --> 07:44.955
Okay, wow.

07:44.955 --> 07:46.590
Stab me in the chest,
why don't you?

07:46.590 --> 07:48.859
Sorry, it's just, what
exactly are you trying to say?

07:48.859 --> 07:51.829
Well, I just--I said
some awful things back then.

07:51.829 --> 07:53.030
You know? I was so mad.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.298
So now I just--I--

07:54.298 --> 07:56.800
I just wanna apologize.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.235
Yeah, I hear you.

07:58.235 --> 08:01.605
But, you know, I think
this should read like 1994,

08:01.605 --> 08:02.840
when you were alive.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.375
I want him to know me now.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.911
I know.
But all you can say

08:06.911 --> 08:08.546
is that you didn't mean
those words

08:08.546 --> 08:10.381
and that you forgive him.

08:10.381 --> 08:12.449
Ugh. Okay.

08:12.449 --> 08:14.485
Note taken.

08:14.485 --> 08:16.387
One last thing.

08:16.387 --> 08:17.688
You know once he reads
the letter,

08:17.688 --> 08:21.191
you're gonna have
to forgive yourself, right?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.062
Start living your life
or whatever,

08:25.062 --> 08:27.831
or living your death.

08:27.831 --> 08:29.600
Live your death.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.502
I love that.

08:31.502 --> 08:33.938
I'm gonna put that
on a T-shirt.

08:46.717 --> 08:48.352
- Ope!
- Sorry.

08:55.893 --> 08:57.761
- Jesus.
- Fuck.

09:01.565 --> 09:04.668
What about checking
the metadata on the phone?

09:04.668 --> 09:05.970
Are you able to pull that up?
- No, I--I did.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.605
There's nothing--
no date, no place,

09:07.605 --> 09:09.239
nothing about the phone
it was shot on.

09:09.239 --> 09:11.775
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

09:11.775 --> 09:13.444
Of all the questions--
and there are many--

09:13.444 --> 09:16.046
this one seems like a big one.

09:16.046 --> 09:17.815
Someone took that video, Nicole.

09:17.815 --> 09:19.516
It doesn't matter
who took the video, all right?

09:19.516 --> 09:21.452
The point is, Claire thinks
Maddie took the video.

09:21.452 --> 09:23.887
So that's what we should
focus on, okay?

09:23.887 --> 09:25.356
Where's your car?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.057
Oh, my parents weren't
thrilled I got called in

09:27.057 --> 09:28.425
by the cops for questioning,

09:28.425 --> 09:31.662
so it's cycle city
for the foreseeable future.

09:31.662 --> 09:34.064
Guess I'm driving
to the dance.

09:34.064 --> 09:35.232
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

09:37.601 --> 09:38.869
Yo, Simon.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.804
Simon.

09:40.804 --> 09:42.006
I think Claire's playing us.

09:42.006 --> 09:43.540
- He's bailing?
- What do you mean?

09:43.540 --> 09:45.776
It's crazy
that she said yes, right?

09:45.776 --> 09:46.844
Not that crazy.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.912
It was a pretty
convincing text.

09:48.912 --> 09:50.314
Of course it was. I wrote it.

09:50.314 --> 09:51.649
And she cornered me
in the locker room earlier

09:51.649 --> 09:53.517
like she was cornering prey,
I swear to God.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.753
Oh, please.
You're hardly prey, Xavier.

09:55.753 --> 09:57.154
Hm. Did you talk?

09:57.154 --> 09:59.089
She's picking me up
at 7:00 tomorrow.

09:59.089 --> 10:00.290
Good.

10:00.290 --> 10:02.026
And she sent me a photo.

10:02.026 --> 10:03.093
Like, a nude?

10:03.093 --> 10:04.762
Not exactly.
I--

10:04.762 --> 10:06.497
I--I feel like
I'm walking into a trap.

10:06.497 --> 10:08.098
Funny.
I don't recall you being scared

10:08.098 --> 10:09.299
when you were hooking up
in your back seat.

10:09.299 --> 10:10.401
Yo, are you listening to me?

10:10.401 --> 10:11.602
I don't think this
is a great plan.

10:11.602 --> 10:13.437
Simon, tell him
he can't back out now.

10:13.437 --> 10:15.072
You can't
back out now, Xavier.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.106
- He owes me.
- You owe me.

10:16.106 --> 10:17.708
I owe you?

10:17.708 --> 10:18.876
Maddie.

10:20.611 --> 10:22.913
You owe Maddie.

10:30.682 --> 10:32.284
I look stupid.

10:32.284 --> 10:34.019
Anything Harry Styles
would wear

10:34.019 --> 10:35.387
is the opposite of stupid.

10:35.387 --> 10:36.621
I--I just don't really
feel like

10:36.621 --> 10:39.057
I can pull off
high-waisted pants.

10:39.057 --> 10:40.225
And do they have to be orange?

10:40.225 --> 10:42.260
It's called fashion, Xavier.

10:43.662 --> 10:45.597
Oh. You know you're not
wearing pants, right?

10:45.597 --> 10:46.765
Yeah.
If I'm getting killed tonight,

10:46.765 --> 10:48.099
it's not gonna be
in anything orange.

10:48.099 --> 10:49.734
Thank you.

10:49.734 --> 10:52.003
Where's the blue suit?

10:52.003 --> 10:54.372
Uh, it's over here. I got it.

10:57.509 --> 11:01.179
Are you seriously worried
Claire might hurt you?

11:04.649 --> 11:05.850
Xavier?

11:05.850 --> 11:07.552
I don't know.

11:07.552 --> 11:09.254
Maybe.

11:09.254 --> 11:11.289
I thought I knew her.

11:11.289 --> 11:12.958
Maybe I don't.

11:14.526 --> 11:16.661
There's no turning back now.

11:19.931 --> 11:21.933
- What's this?
- When I was cleaning up,

11:21.933 --> 11:25.303
I found this essay Maddie wrote
for her college application.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.772
I hate doing stuff online,

11:27.772 --> 11:29.874
but I don't want her
to miss any deadline.

11:29.874 --> 11:32.010
She already turned it in.

11:32.010 --> 11:33.044
Early decision.

11:33.044 --> 11:35.013
Uh, we both did.

11:35.013 --> 11:37.515
Well, I thought Nicole said
something about a deadline.

11:37.515 --> 11:39.618
For her.
Nicole's submitting a portfolio

11:39.618 --> 11:41.419
for art school in Chicago.
- Oh.

11:41.419 --> 11:43.788
The idea is we'd all be
together in the same city.

11:43.788 --> 11:45.824
At least that was--
that was the plan.

11:47.325 --> 11:49.828
It still is.

11:49.828 --> 11:51.663
Maddie is coming home.

11:51.663 --> 11:53.965
They found her backpack
at that house

11:53.965 --> 11:57.569
and evidence that someone's
been sleeping there.

11:57.569 --> 12:00.338
I have to believe
that she's coming back.

12:02.073 --> 12:04.175
You're right.
I'm, uh--

12:04.175 --> 12:06.077
I'm sorry.

12:09.748 --> 12:14.352
She hasn't tried
to reach out to you at all?

12:14.352 --> 12:16.321
You would let me know
if she had, wouldn't you?

12:16.321 --> 12:18.356
Of course.

12:20.191 --> 12:21.726
I should go.

12:21.726 --> 12:23.728
I gotta get ready.
Tonight's homecoming.

12:23.728 --> 12:26.097
Going to my first
high school dance.

12:26.097 --> 12:28.433
Oh, that's sweet.

12:28.433 --> 12:31.002
Will you send me some pictures?

12:31.002 --> 12:33.204
You know, I always thought
that it would be nice

12:33.204 --> 12:37.309
if you and Maddie went
to that together.

12:46.484 --> 12:49.888
Oh, you're her best friend, Simon.

12:51.656 --> 12:54.559
I don't know
what she would do without you.

12:56.394 --> 12:57.996
Thank you.

13:06.604 --> 13:08.873
Could I borrow this?

13:26.291 --> 13:28.126
Beep, beep!

13:28.126 --> 13:30.528
Your ride has arrived, m'lady.

13:30.528 --> 13:31.730
You're late.

13:31.730 --> 13:34.666
How will I ever
make it up to you?

13:34.666 --> 13:36.267
Promise me that's
not a hot dog.

13:36.267 --> 13:37.402
Well, that can be arranged.

13:37.402 --> 13:40.739
Um... well, you look amazing.

13:40.739 --> 13:43.441
Well, you can thank

13:43.441 --> 13:45.210
the theater's
costume department

13:45.210 --> 13:48.480
and Dawn's gift with
the home ec sewing machine,

13:48.480 --> 13:50.782
although it's really unsettling

13:50.782 --> 13:52.350
to watch her laugh
with pins in her mouth.

13:52.350 --> 13:53.651
Uh, yeah.

13:53.651 --> 13:57.489
Well, speaking of gifts,
I, um--

14:02.460 --> 14:04.496
57?

14:04.496 --> 14:05.864
Your football number?

14:05.864 --> 14:07.665
Yeah. Ah, shit.

14:07.665 --> 14:09.467
You hate this, don't you?
I'm sorry.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.435
- No.
- This--I'm embarrassed.

14:10.435 --> 14:11.636
No, this is so stupid.

14:11.636 --> 14:12.704
It's so stupid.
It's just something

14:12.704 --> 14:14.372
we used to do back in the '80s.

14:14.372 --> 14:15.540
It's a thing, you know?
- Wally--

14:15.540 --> 14:16.574
- As a football player--
- It's sweet.

14:16.574 --> 14:18.109
Yeah.

14:18.109 --> 14:20.412
It was hard to find flowers,
so I had to,

14:20.412 --> 14:22.380
uh, use paper, as you can see.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.715
So, uh,

14:23.715 --> 14:25.517
stay away from an open flame.

14:25.517 --> 14:27.285
Cool? All right, let's go.

14:30.755 --> 14:31.990
After you.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.224
- Wow.
- I know.

14:33.224 --> 14:34.726
It's a pretty sweet ride.

14:37.495 --> 14:39.130
Here we go.

14:41.232 --> 14:42.967
Whoo!

14:44.502 --> 14:46.171
Hm.

14:47.872 --> 14:49.207
That's very generous, Claire.

14:49.207 --> 14:50.842
Oh, it's nothing.

14:50.842 --> 14:52.677
My parents just wanted
to show their support

14:52.677 --> 14:53.945
for your re-election.

14:53.945 --> 14:55.313
Well, I'll be sure
to give 'em a call.

14:55.313 --> 14:57.348
Let me just see
what's taking Xavier so long.

14:57.348 --> 14:58.450
Oh, no rush.

14:58.450 --> 14:59.918
No, I'm early.

14:59.918 --> 15:02.754
My mom always says,
if you're on time, you're late.

15:02.754 --> 15:06.024
Yeah.
Her meds are helping with that.

15:06.024 --> 15:08.726
I'm just glad the school
didn't cancel homecoming.

15:08.726 --> 15:11.863
Yeah, this year
has been unreal.

15:11.863 --> 15:15.033
First Maddie
and then Mr. Anderson...

15:15.033 --> 15:17.035
Yeah, it's nothing
you kids need to worry about.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.570
The police are on it.
- It's hard not

15:18.570 --> 15:22.340
to wonder though
if we'll ever have any answers.

15:22.340 --> 15:24.909
Are there any updates?

15:24.909 --> 15:27.912
Mm, nothing I can share
quite yet.

15:27.912 --> 15:30.515
My parents keep asking
why Anderson's not speaking.

15:30.515 --> 15:32.450
Or is he?

15:32.450 --> 15:34.519
Do we think he had
anything to do

15:34.519 --> 15:36.488
with what happened to Maddie?

15:36.488 --> 15:39.624
It's an ongoing
investigation, Claire.

15:39.624 --> 15:41.626
But, uh, be sure
to tell you folks

15:41.626 --> 15:43.161
we're very thankful
they're cooperating

15:43.161 --> 15:45.497
while we continue to search
the abandoned property.

15:45.497 --> 15:47.031
Will you?

15:49.400 --> 15:50.802
Hey.

15:50.802 --> 15:52.837
I--I couldn't find my belt.

15:52.837 --> 15:53.972
Wow.

15:53.972 --> 15:56.508
You look--
- Almost respectable.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.911
This is your influence,
I'm guessing.

16:02.146 --> 16:05.383
Yeah, you look great.

16:05.383 --> 16:06.651
Thanks.

16:06.651 --> 16:08.586
Make sure he behaves himself,
will you?

16:08.586 --> 16:11.356
And you, you better
look after that suit.

16:11.356 --> 16:13.057
You know, your grandfather had
a suit like that--

16:13.057 --> 16:15.226
had it his whole life.

16:15.226 --> 16:17.295
He was buried in it.

16:31.843 --> 16:34.078
What? It's called
psychological torture.

16:34.078 --> 16:36.514
- I guess.
- Her penetrating gaze

16:36.514 --> 16:38.883
watches over us,
especially Claire.

16:38.883 --> 16:40.118
Uh-huh.

16:40.118 --> 16:42.153
If you really got
something to hide,

16:42.153 --> 16:43.187
her eyes follow you.

16:43.187 --> 16:44.856
Yeah, no, I get it. Stop.

16:44.856 --> 16:48.393
Hey.
Did you put that up there?

16:48.393 --> 16:51.062
Is that a problem?

16:51.062 --> 16:53.565
No, no,
it's a really nice gesture.

16:53.565 --> 16:56.134
She should be here,
at least in our thoughts.

16:58.436 --> 17:00.238
Please. No one even knew her.

17:00.238 --> 17:01.973
The last place Maddie
would wanna be is here.

17:01.973 --> 17:04.108
Yeah, I wanted to tell
her mom that, but I couldn't.

17:04.108 --> 17:05.577
This morning Sandra said
she always thought

17:05.577 --> 17:07.712
Maddie and I would end up
going to homecoming together.

17:07.712 --> 17:10.315
Hm. I can see that.

17:10.315 --> 17:11.883
What? Why?

17:11.883 --> 17:13.084
Please, you never
thought about it?

17:13.084 --> 17:14.319
Nope.

17:16.487 --> 17:18.356
Maybe once, but I--

17:18.356 --> 17:19.524
I shut it down immediately.

17:19.524 --> 17:20.925
Yeah, yeah.

17:20.925 --> 17:23.828
She's my best friend.

17:23.828 --> 17:25.563
The stakes are way too high.

17:29.367 --> 17:32.136
<i>When was the last time
you wore a suit?</i>

17:32.136 --> 17:33.871
<i>The only dance
I've ever been to</i>

17:33.871 --> 17:36.074
<i>was a middle school mixer,</i>

17:36.074 --> 17:39.477
and I was only there
'cause my band was playing.

17:39.477 --> 17:40.878
Cute.

17:44.849 --> 17:47.619
What just happened?

17:47.619 --> 17:50.188
Why are we killing the engine?

17:50.188 --> 17:51.222
Claire?

17:52.523 --> 17:53.725
I wanna talk.

17:53.725 --> 17:55.226
Isn't that what we're doing?

17:57.095 --> 18:01.799
The cheerleaders might be
a bit bitchy to you tonight.

18:01.799 --> 18:03.401
That tracks.

18:03.401 --> 18:04.535
Mm.

18:04.535 --> 18:05.770
I wanted to prep for you.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.205
When I mentioned
I was going with you,

18:07.205 --> 18:09.774
they've been very judgey.

18:09.774 --> 18:11.643
Extra spicy, you know.

18:11.643 --> 18:14.112
Right.
Well, consider me prepped.

18:14.112 --> 18:16.180
Can we get back on the road?
'Cause I think if we're--

18:16.180 --> 18:17.482
They've noticed
you've been hanging out

18:17.482 --> 18:19.951
with Nicole lately.

18:19.951 --> 18:22.854
Kristin saw you hang out
at the mall together.

18:22.854 --> 18:24.622
What's that about?

18:26.457 --> 18:27.892
She was Maddie's best friend.

18:27.892 --> 18:29.527
We were always
around each other.

18:39.270 --> 18:41.139
Can we go now?

18:44.242 --> 18:45.576
No.

18:54.552 --> 18:56.854
Now we can go.

19:10.763 --> 19:14.033
Oh, look at you,
Dead Astaire.

19:14.033 --> 19:15.801
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, Mr. Peanut.

19:25.377 --> 19:30.549
You look, uh, um...

19:30.549 --> 19:31.617
Use your words.

19:37.122 --> 19:39.024
I like your jacket.

19:44.063 --> 19:45.431
So you plan on dancing tonight?

19:45.431 --> 19:46.732
Oh, hell no. No.

19:46.732 --> 19:49.935
Unless they miraculously play,
like, Roicc,

19:49.935 --> 19:51.670
I'll be focused
on Operation Claire.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.973
- Yeah, they here yet?
- Not yet.

19:53.973 --> 19:56.709
But in the meantime,

19:56.709 --> 19:58.811
here's Charley's letter

19:58.811 --> 20:03.015
transcribed
to world-of-the-living paper.

20:03.015 --> 20:05.317
You got any more ghost friends
that need favors?

20:05.317 --> 20:06.919
Can I charge them?

20:06.919 --> 20:09.255
I think that's already cost
Charley plenty,

20:09.255 --> 20:11.090
but thank you.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.691
And where is this Charley?

20:12.691 --> 20:14.159
Is he standing
right next to you?

20:14.159 --> 20:15.327
Hi.

20:15.327 --> 20:16.495
No.

20:17.997 --> 20:21.166
But he's very grateful, Simon.

20:21.166 --> 20:24.603
That letter's gonna help him
more than you can imagine.

20:24.603 --> 20:27.706
Help him what...

20:27.706 --> 20:30.509
cross over?

20:30.509 --> 20:32.177
Is that gonna happen

20:32.177 --> 20:36.415
when we figure out
what happened to you?

20:38.183 --> 20:39.318
Maybe.

20:43.355 --> 20:46.058
So yeah, just, uh,
tell him that you found it

20:46.058 --> 20:48.894
in between the pages of an old
library book or something.

20:48.894 --> 20:52.731
Um, I gotta go.
I'll just--

20:52.731 --> 20:54.233
I'll come find you
in a sec, okay?

20:56.201 --> 20:57.670
Punch.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.271
- Thank you.
- Course.

21:05.377 --> 21:08.747
So... what do we do now?

21:08.747 --> 21:10.149
Hey.
- Relax. Just--

21:10.149 --> 21:11.750
- You just gave that to me.
- Come on, let's go.

21:11.750 --> 21:12.951
- Wally.
- Come on.

21:12.951 --> 21:14.186
- Wally, I don't dance.
- We're dancing.

21:14.186 --> 21:15.688
Yes. Yes.

21:15.688 --> 21:16.655
Give me your hands.

21:16.655 --> 21:17.823
Loosen up.

21:17.823 --> 21:19.825
Let's get wavy.

21:19.825 --> 21:22.594
I didn't know
dancing was this easy.

21:22.594 --> 21:24.530
Ooh. Okay, watch.

21:24.530 --> 21:26.799
Boom, boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

21:26.799 --> 21:29.101

- Just back off.

27:01.366 --> 27:02.901
Both of you, okay?

27:04.736 --> 27:07.239
It's Sandra.

27:07.239 --> 27:09.041
- Dude.
- I'll call her back tomorrow.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.075
I just can't handle it
right now.

27:11.910 --> 27:13.612
She's calling me now.

27:13.612 --> 27:15.213
She needs more friends her age.

27:15.213 --> 27:16.782
You're being a jerk.

27:18.784 --> 27:21.219
Hey, Sandra.

27:21.219 --> 27:23.255
Could you repeat that?
I couldn't--

27:23.255 --> 27:25.157
Maddie?

27:25.157 --> 27:26.758
Wait, did you call the cops?

27:28.260 --> 27:29.895
Yeah, no,
that's probably smart.

27:31.363 --> 27:33.365
Okay. I'll be right there.

27:35.233 --> 27:36.368
She said she was watching TV

27:36.368 --> 27:37.869
and she heard someone
in the backyard.

27:37.869 --> 27:40.205
She thinks it's Maddie.

27:40.205 --> 27:42.307
She's afraid to call the police
in case they scare Maddie off.

27:42.307 --> 27:44.776
She wants us to come over.

27:44.776 --> 27:46.878
You know what?
I--I'll handle it.

27:46.878 --> 27:48.246
Can you find a ride home?

28:03.995 --> 28:05.130
Mr. Figueroa.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.364
Hey, what's up, Simon?

28:06.364 --> 28:08.767
Uh, isn't your first name
Emilio?

28:08.767 --> 28:09.935
Yeah.

28:09.935 --> 28:12.104
I think I found
something that, uh,

28:12.104 --> 28:13.805
belongs to you--maybe.

28:15.307 --> 28:17.342
I was in the library yesterday.

28:17.342 --> 28:19.144
I found this tucked
into an old copy

28:19.144 --> 28:21.012
of "The Things They Carried."

28:25.317 --> 28:28.854
Look, Maddie,
you know I hate to brag.

28:28.854 --> 28:31.790
And even though I was dead and
I couldn't put on the crown,

28:31.790 --> 28:34.459
I did win Homecoming King
my senior year.

28:34.459 --> 28:36.361
I know, I know.

28:36.361 --> 28:39.464
Was it an honorary thing

28:39.464 --> 28:40.899
because you died
the night before the dance?

28:40.899 --> 28:42.167
No. No. Hell, no.

28:42.167 --> 28:43.668
No, I won fair and square, okay?

28:43.668 --> 28:46.037
I got all my votes
before I got hit.

28:46.037 --> 28:47.606
Maddie, I don't know
if you know this about me,

28:47.606 --> 28:49.574
but I'm actually
pretty charming.

28:52.811 --> 28:57.249
I liked kissing you earlier
in the car.

28:57.249 --> 28:59.484
Yeah, I'm a good kisser.

28:59.484 --> 29:01.553
We've established that.

29:04.222 --> 29:06.424
You know my soft spot.

29:08.693 --> 29:11.997
What game are you playing?

29:11.997 --> 29:14.933
You wanna get out of here?

29:14.933 --> 29:16.368
Trust me.

29:20.872 --> 29:22.908
Hey, Maddie,
I think this was a bad idea.

29:22.908 --> 29:24.810
What was?

29:24.810 --> 29:27.245
Coming to this dance together.

29:27.245 --> 29:29.080
What? No.

29:29.080 --> 29:32.050
I just--I, um--

29:32.050 --> 29:34.786
I don't think you're really
ready to be dead yet.

29:36.922 --> 29:38.423
Is anyone?

29:40.258 --> 29:41.593
I am.

29:43.662 --> 29:49.000
Okay.
But you're, like, old dead.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.569
I--that came out wrong.

29:50.569 --> 29:53.705
I just mean that I have been
dead for two weeks, Wally.

29:53.705 --> 29:54.873
And--

29:56.208 --> 29:58.043
Wait, where'd they go?

30:09.549 --> 30:11.050
Where's your date?

30:11.050 --> 30:12.218
What?

30:12.218 --> 30:13.519
6'2", dark hair,

30:13.519 --> 30:16.155
part boy,
part golden retriever.

30:16.155 --> 30:18.391
I can't really worry
about him right now, Rhonda.

30:18.391 --> 30:19.592
Ouch.

30:19.592 --> 30:21.894
So much for Wally's
special night.

30:21.894 --> 30:23.396
Have you seen
Xavier and Claire?

30:23.396 --> 30:25.665
I don't know who that is.

30:50.957 --> 30:52.859
You know, we could've gone
to the parking lot.

30:52.859 --> 30:54.927
This is way hotter.

30:57.463 --> 31:00.066
Not to kink shame, but--

31:02.268 --> 31:03.736
What is that?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.439
Xavier, what are you doing?

31:14.414 --> 31:16.883
Where'd you find it?

31:16.883 --> 31:19.185
Over here
by these back bushes.

31:19.185 --> 31:21.087
Oh, yeah. What you got?

31:21.087 --> 31:22.789
It was buried.

31:22.789 --> 31:24.424
We figured
if the backpack was here,

31:24.424 --> 31:26.025
there could be something else.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.595
Nice work.

31:31.564 --> 31:35.134
And you thought
you could bring me down here

31:35.134 --> 31:36.736
to what, Xavier, to what?

31:36.736 --> 31:38.271
To force a confession
out of me?

31:38.271 --> 31:40.139
Did you kill her, Claire?

31:40.139 --> 31:42.008
I know you swapped
Maddie's phone.

31:42.008 --> 31:43.910
Is that why you wanted
to drive tonight,

31:43.910 --> 31:45.545
so when you picked me up
you could get some answers

31:45.545 --> 31:47.914
out of my dad, huh?

31:47.914 --> 31:50.683
You know, maybe--

31:50.683 --> 31:53.619
maybe I should have
shown my dad this.

31:53.619 --> 31:55.721
How do you have this?

31:55.721 --> 31:57.023
Xavier, who else has seen this?

31:57.023 --> 31:58.558
Other people,
so deleting it's not gonna

31:58.558 --> 31:59.759
make a difference.

32:02.361 --> 32:03.763
Jesus.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.438
I figured out
Mr. Anderson was dealing.

32:12.438 --> 32:15.608
Okay, and--
and I saw an opportunity,

32:15.608 --> 32:16.843
and I took it.

32:16.843 --> 32:20.413
Okay, people do this shit
every day.

32:20.413 --> 32:22.615
It was one class.

32:22.615 --> 32:25.585
I just needed an A, Xavier.

32:26.919 --> 32:28.921
I told Mr. Anderson
that if he gave me an A,

32:28.921 --> 32:30.790
I wouldn't say anything
about the money.

32:30.790 --> 32:32.425
What about Maddie's phone?

32:32.425 --> 32:33.559
Why'd you swap it?

32:33.559 --> 32:34.660
What'd you do
with the real one?

32:34.660 --> 32:35.962
We thought Maddie took
the video.

32:35.962 --> 32:38.498
And I just wanted to delete it.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.699
But I couldn't unlock it,

32:39.699 --> 32:41.667
so I gave it
to Mr. Anderson, okay?

32:41.667 --> 32:43.102
He was the one
that got rid of it.

32:43.102 --> 32:44.770
You better not
be lying to me.

32:44.770 --> 32:47.707
I told him to pay her off,

32:47.707 --> 32:51.711
to--to give her the money,
whatever she wanted.

32:51.711 --> 32:54.580
But that is all I did.

32:56.048 --> 32:58.818
For me, there is no room
for failure.

32:58.818 --> 33:02.188
Okay, and maybe
that seems dumb to you.

33:04.023 --> 33:07.126
Everyone just thinks
that I have it so easy.

33:07.126 --> 33:09.328
But do you know
how much work it takes

33:09.328 --> 33:13.366
to make everything look easy?

33:13.366 --> 33:15.735
I know we made a mistake,

33:15.735 --> 33:18.437
Anderson and I,

33:18.437 --> 33:22.174
you and I, cheating.

33:22.174 --> 33:25.912
I have been terrified.

33:25.912 --> 33:31.250
Everything just--
it spun out of control so fast.

33:31.250 --> 33:34.020
I didn't hurt Maddie.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.556
I don't know
what happened to her.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.692
But it wasn't me.

36:09.642 --> 36:11.377
What the hell is happening?

36:11.377 --> 36:12.878
Where were they?

36:12.878 --> 36:14.714
Claire didn't do anything
to Maddie.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.083
I believe her. I do.

36:17.083 --> 36:20.219
Claire was blackmailing
Anderson for grades.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.188
When Claire and Anderson got
that video,

36:22.188 --> 36:23.789
they thought
that Maddie had taken it,

36:23.789 --> 36:26.225
so they paid her off.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.961
When Maddie disappeared,
Claire panicked.

36:28.961 --> 36:29.995
I mean,
if that video got out there,

36:29.995 --> 36:31.163
people would think that--

36:31.163 --> 36:32.498
That's motive.

36:32.498 --> 36:33.933
Yeah.

36:33.933 --> 36:35.568
They couldn't get
into Maddie's locked phone,

36:35.568 --> 36:37.803
so they destroyed it.

36:37.803 --> 36:39.171
We were right,

36:39.171 --> 36:42.942
but Claire wouldn't
hurt Maddie.

36:42.942 --> 36:44.777
She wouldn't.

36:46.779 --> 36:49.014
I believe her.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.922
There was somebody out there.

36:56.922 --> 36:58.758
I believe you.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.727
<i>Sandra, you home?</i>

37:01.727 --> 37:02.795
Did you call the police?

37:02.795 --> 37:03.963
No.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.776
Hi.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.812
I promised I'd, um--

37:19.812 --> 37:21.347
well, I have some news.

37:23.382 --> 37:28.487
You know the empty house where
we found Maddie's backpack?

37:28.487 --> 37:30.222
Yes.

37:30.222 --> 37:32.858
Well, we found
something else,

37:32.858 --> 37:34.560
a possible murder weapon.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.495
What?

37:36.495 --> 37:38.230
Murder weapon?

37:38.230 --> 37:41.500
<i>We've traced the object to,
uh, a person of interest.</i>

37:41.500 --> 37:44.403
<i>They're being brought in
for questioning as we speak.</i>

37:44.403 --> 37:45.604
<i>Who?</i>

37:48.107 --> 37:50.209
- Roger South?
- Yeah?

37:50.209 --> 37:51.844
<i>It's an employee
at the high school.</i>

37:51.844 --> 37:53.379
I can't release a name
just yet.

37:53.379 --> 37:54.747
I'm sorry.

37:54.747 --> 37:56.182
But it's not Anderson.

37:56.182 --> 37:59.018
He has a solid alibi.

37:59.018 --> 38:00.719
As soon as I have
more information I can share,

38:00.719 --> 38:03.189
you'll be the first to know.

38:03.189 --> 38:05.825
Why--

38:05.825 --> 38:07.993
why would someone do this?

38:07.993 --> 38:09.962
Anderson has given us
enough information

38:09.962 --> 38:11.897
to believe that, uh,

38:11.897 --> 38:15.601
Maddie had a great deal
of money on her.

38:15.601 --> 38:17.403
And this person wanted it.

38:26.011 --> 38:27.379
Sandra.

38:55.941 --> 38:59.144
I was Team Crystal.

38:59.144 --> 39:01.647
Oh, okay, humor did not work.

39:01.647 --> 39:04.516
Uh, let's try truth.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.553
Being a ghost sucks.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.621
Yup.

39:08.621 --> 39:10.356
I mean,
you're forced to watch

39:10.356 --> 39:13.058
your cheating ex-BF dance
with your cheating ex-BFF,

39:13.058 --> 39:16.962
and they have no idea
you even exist.

39:16.962 --> 39:18.130
If you're trying
to cheer me up--

39:18.130 --> 39:21.233
Okay, I--I wasn't done.

39:21.233 --> 39:26.839
Being a ghost sucks
most of the time.

39:26.839 --> 39:31.477
But today I was able
to watch the love of my life

39:31.477 --> 39:36.982
close a very old,
very deep wound...

39:36.982 --> 39:38.984
thanks to you.

39:42.655 --> 39:44.189
How do you feel now?

39:47.226 --> 39:50.963
I'm ready to forgive.

39:50.963 --> 39:53.332
Live my death, remember?

39:55.434 --> 39:57.436
It's good advice, you know.

39:59.271 --> 40:02.207
Maybe it's time you,

40:02.207 --> 40:06.412
you know, take it.

40:14.954 --> 40:19.591

40:56.862 --> 40:58.330
There was a lot happening,

40:58.330 --> 41:01.767
and I didn't want
to ruin this night for you.

41:01.767 --> 41:03.836
But I should have just
been honest with you

41:03.836 --> 41:04.870
and told you what was going on.

41:04.870 --> 41:06.038
Maddie, it's--it's fine.

41:06.038 --> 41:07.039
You don't have
to apologize to me.

41:07.039 --> 41:08.640

Now here's a song for the sad
guy popping balloons.

42:12.938 --> 42:15.074
Hey.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.608
- Listen.
- I know, this song.

42:16.608 --> 42:19.144
We were just talking about it--
- Simon, listen.

42:19.144 --> 42:21.013
But what did they find?

42:21.013 --> 42:22.347
A weapon.

42:22.347 --> 42:23.482
A weapon that may have
been used

42:23.482 --> 42:26.385
to murder Maddie Nears.

42:26.385 --> 42:27.486
And then how do they know
that it's--

42:27.486 --> 42:29.455
South!
He's the only one

42:29.455 --> 42:31.390
who had access
to that tool cabinet.

42:31.390 --> 42:32.724
- Mr. South?
- Do you have your keys?

42:32.724 --> 42:34.359
Yeah, I do.
I'll take care of it.

42:34.359 --> 42:36.395
Just--I can't believe it.
