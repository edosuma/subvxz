01:46.925 --> 01:48.510
Hey.

03:34.449 --> 03:36.284
Krahn?

03:38.578 --> 03:39.996
No.

03:52.050 --> 03:55.595
- Is that your government car?
- Church.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.722
Is that where you work?

03:59.015 --> 04:01.226
I volunteer.

04:18.201 --> 04:20.452
Hey! Stop!

04:20.577 --> 04:22.120
Stop the car!

04:55.196 --> 04:58.074
You can handle this, Brother Abubakar.

04:58.199 --> 05:01.452
Make sure their needs are met
and they're kept safe.

05:01.578 --> 05:04.205
These are fine young men, Philip.
They look up to you.

05:04.330 --> 05:08.543
Once things have stabilized here,
they will be a powerful force for good.

05:08.668 --> 05:09.919
And until then?

05:11.588 --> 05:13.756
Keep moving forward.

07:07.245 --> 07:09.580
- Be careful.
- I know.

07:09.706 --> 07:12.750
Here, watch your step.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.043
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.170
Okay. Good.

07:16.963 --> 07:19.966
Menti, where is Abubakar?

07:20.091 --> 07:21.718
He'll come.

07:24.554 --> 07:26.514
Should we wait for him?

07:27.306 --> 07:28.850
Should we?

07:28.975 --> 07:31.060
No. It would just worry everyone.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.813
Thank you, Elder.

07:38.276 --> 07:39.986
Are you ready?

07:40.111 --> 07:42.572
Yes, I am.

08:11.934 --> 08:14.437
Akatika Ronke Delia,

08:14.562 --> 08:17.690
having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ...

08:50.848 --> 08:54.185
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

09:02.819 --> 09:05.029
I felt clean and peaceful.

09:05.154 --> 09:07.281
You almost missed it.

09:07.406 --> 09:09.117
I got stuck in the mud.

09:09.242 --> 09:12.703
Poor thing is starting to get old.

09:14.956 --> 09:16.916
And on top of that, there were rebels.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.502
Children with guns, stealing car parts.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.337
They stopped you?

09:21.462 --> 09:23.172
No need.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.924
I was a mouse in a trap.

09:25.049 --> 09:26.968
I couldn't leave the car,
and that got them curious.

09:27.093 --> 09:30.138
But they didn't do anything to you.

09:30.263 --> 09:32.014
They asked if I was Krahn.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.391
Wanted to intimidate me.

09:33.516 --> 09:36.352
You don't need to fear us.

09:37.687 --> 09:39.105
And if I'm Krahn?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.440
Oh, you are not.

09:45.903 --> 09:47.321
But if I am, what then?

09:47.446 --> 09:50.116
Should I fear the rebels?

09:53.786 --> 09:57.331
We want only to be treated fairly.

10:00.042 --> 10:03.462
That is what we all want.

10:06.924 --> 10:09.177
- Congratulations, Akatika.
- Thank you.

10:09.302 --> 10:12.013
We'll be by Sunday morning
to walk with you to church.

10:12.138 --> 10:14.015
You wait here. I'll be back for you.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.391
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

10:15.516 --> 10:18.603
There's still light enough.
Don't worry, Brother Abubakar.

10:18.728 --> 10:21.063
Brother Abubakar can't help it.
He was born to worry.

10:22.982 --> 10:23.983
It is true, you know.

10:24.108 --> 10:29.030
My mother never worried because
I did enough for the both of us.

10:29.155 --> 10:30.740
- You hurry back, okay?
- We will.

10:30.865 --> 10:33.075
Let's move.

10:34.327 --> 10:37.413
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure they'll be fine.

11:05.441 --> 11:07.068
Well done, boys.

11:07.193 --> 11:08.945
Stay safe out there in Paynesville.

11:09.070 --> 11:10.571
- Stay safe in Monrovia.
- Take care of yourselves.

11:10.696 --> 11:12.657
All right.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.083
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

11:22.208 --> 11:24.377
Hurry up!

11:52.822 --> 11:54.865
I got the Book of Mormon.

11:57.743 --> 11:59.453
Your shirt in the wardrobe.

12:10.131 --> 12:11.966
Church isn't going to wait for us.

12:12.091 --> 12:14.093
Uh-huh.

12:28.190 --> 12:30.401
Your turn.

12:42.246 --> 12:44.540
Amen.

12:47.543 --> 12:49.211
- Are you okay?
- Why?

12:49.337 --> 12:50.463
Yeah, sure.

12:50.588 --> 12:51.589
Good.

12:51.714 --> 12:54.800
Grab your tag.

13:10.649 --> 13:12.860
- They are coming.
- Move! Move!

13:12.985 --> 13:14.779
Move it!

13:16.197 --> 13:17.573
Menti, are you okay?

13:21.911 --> 13:23.162
Stay there. Stay there.

13:23.287 --> 13:24.747
Brother, stay down. Stay down.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.583
Get out of my way!

13:29.877 --> 13:30.878
Get down.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.841
Move it!

13:40.638 --> 13:41.639
Shut up.

13:41.764 --> 13:44.058
Doe's people will pay for his sins.

13:44.183 --> 13:45.726
- I'm not Krahn.
- Really?

13:45.851 --> 13:47.269
I'm... I'm not Krahn.

13:47.395 --> 13:49.605
Just shut up!

13:55.986 --> 13:57.613
It's good to see you today.

15:04.013 --> 15:06.015
What's going on?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.226
I don't know.

15:18.527 --> 15:19.528
Stay down.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.614
Get down. Get down.

15:40.174 --> 15:42.134
What's going on?

15:44.595 --> 15:47.056
I...

15:55.147 --> 15:57.525
He'll have to stay inside.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.569
Excuse me.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.905
Sister Akatika, the missionaries,
Menti and Meyers,

16:03.030 --> 16:04.281
they did not come with you
to church today?

16:04.406 --> 16:08.369
No, I waited for them.
They didn't show up. I came by myself.

16:08.494 --> 16:09.787
I see. I'm sorry they were not there.

16:09.912 --> 16:12.456
It's no problem.
I would come either way.

16:12.581 --> 16:14.333
I believe you.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.669
Is everything all right?

16:17.753 --> 16:19.755
Excuse me.

16:22.258 --> 16:23.634
Elders, we have to go now.

16:23.759 --> 16:24.802
Now.

16:24.927 --> 16:26.845
All right. All right.

16:26.971 --> 16:28.055
Wait. I'm coming with you.

17:09.972 --> 17:11.932
Where are you going?

17:12.057 --> 17:14.602
You may want to get packed.

17:14.727 --> 17:16.770
What are you talking about?

17:16.895 --> 17:20.232
We're not staying here anymore.

17:32.077 --> 17:34.872
We are not going anywhere.

17:34.997 --> 17:37.166
There was much rebel activity
last night,

17:37.291 --> 17:39.668
and Brothers Menti and Meyers
have not been seen.

17:39.793 --> 17:40.794
Really?

17:40.919 --> 17:42.713
Abubakar, easy.

17:43.547 --> 17:45.215
Whoa, oh! Watch out! There's a car!

17:45.341 --> 17:46.342
Sorry about that.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.260
We need to get there
in one piece, Abubakar.

17:48.385 --> 17:49.928
You're going to hit somebody
if you continue like this.

17:50.054 --> 17:51.805
Abubakar, easy now. Come on.

17:51.930 --> 17:55.768
What if something happened to them?
What will I say to President Cunningham?

17:55.893 --> 17:59.647
I should have been there
for them this morning.

17:59.772 --> 18:01.690
Save your promises.

18:04.526 --> 18:07.780
- That's why we go to church every week.
- Maybe next.

18:07.905 --> 18:10.574
Okay. I'll take that as a yes.

18:10.699 --> 18:11.784
- How do you do that?
- What?

18:11.909 --> 18:13.535
Talk to people so easily.

18:13.661 --> 18:15.329
- Do I?
- Yeah.

18:15.454 --> 18:17.790
Can't just go up to someone
you don't know like it's nothing.

18:17.915 --> 18:19.708
Yeah, it's nothing. Just say hello.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.419
- No, it's not that easy.
- Have you tried?

18:22.544 --> 18:25.714
- I'm not good at talking to people.
- Then why are you here?

18:25.839 --> 18:27.216
To teach people, I guess.

18:27.341 --> 18:30.052
How can you teach people
if you can't talk to them?

18:30.177 --> 18:31.261
I teach by example.

18:31.387 --> 18:34.264
The example of not opening your mouth.

18:36.016 --> 18:37.434
You open your mouth,
you're teaching people.

18:37.559 --> 18:40.020
- Hey.
- Hey, missionaries.

18:40.145 --> 18:41.980
You should come to church
with us, David.

18:42.106 --> 18:43.732
Your goats will love it.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.651
No, goats don't belong at church.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.361
- Did you know that?
- What?

18:47.486 --> 18:49.113
That goats don't belong at church.

18:49.238 --> 18:50.906
Isn't that just nonsense?

18:51.031 --> 18:52.449
I, uh...

18:52.574 --> 18:55.202
Hey, I've seen all types at church.

18:55.327 --> 18:56.537
You're being funny.

18:56.662 --> 18:57.871
You're too smart for us.

18:57.996 --> 19:00.040
But bring you and your family
along this week.

19:00.165 --> 19:01.333
Okay, I'll tell them.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.502
Learn about a Good Shepherd.
Sounds good?

19:03.627 --> 19:04.920
Yes.

19:05.045 --> 19:06.296
That's my guy.

19:06.422 --> 19:07.715
Take care, David.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.551
Don't forget to bring your goats.

19:10.676 --> 19:13.262
You see? Easy.

19:13.387 --> 19:14.805
If you say so.

19:20.102 --> 19:22.229
- Is that...?
- Rebels.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.610
What are you doing out here?

19:28.736 --> 19:29.903
You shouldn't be here.

19:30.028 --> 19:32.156
We're just teaching about...

19:32.281 --> 19:34.867
I know who you are.

19:34.992 --> 19:36.076
Are you trying to get shot?

19:36.201 --> 19:38.620
- They're not after missionaries.
- No.

19:39.705 --> 19:42.040
They are after Krahn.

19:44.209 --> 19:47.463
- Gaye?
- Yes.

19:47.588 --> 19:50.507
My name. It shows that I'm a Krahn.

20:00.225 --> 20:01.310
Shoot all the Krahn.

20:01.435 --> 20:03.562
Run!

20:08.817 --> 20:10.819
That way. That way. That way. Move.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.613
Run away!

20:12.738 --> 20:16.576
No, no, no, this way. Come back.
Everybody, get inside.

20:36.762 --> 20:38.138
Kids, come on!

20:39.932 --> 20:41.600
Hurry! Hurry!

20:45.187 --> 20:47.189
Violence escalated this morning

20:47.314 --> 20:52.069
as NPFL forces seized control
of outlying areas of Monrovia.

20:52.194 --> 20:55.155
Shortages of food and water
in Paynesville

20:55.280 --> 20:59.827
are forcing thousands of refugees
to plead for aid from the United Nations.

20:59.952 --> 21:02.120
The NPFL threatens
conditions will worsen...

21:02.246 --> 21:03.705
Hey, look out!

21:03.831 --> 21:06.166
...as long as President Doe
controls the government.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.418
President Doe's actions...

21:08.544 --> 21:11.463
- Abubakar.
- Shh. Hang on, Elders.

21:11.588 --> 21:14.216
We are trapped. No food. No water.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.093
They shoot us if we try to escape.

21:16.218 --> 21:19.012
Rebels are setting up checkpoints
at the edge of the city,

21:19.137 --> 21:21.723
discouraging any who are trying to flee.

21:21.849 --> 21:22.850
No Krahns can get by me.

21:22.975 --> 21:27.145
I'll make sure I pull out in front
of every Krahn that crosses my path.

21:27.271 --> 21:29.690
We can get no food, water.

21:29.815 --> 21:32.317
- Our kids have been shot at.
- Come on.

21:32.442 --> 21:35.195
Come, come. Come on.

21:39.616 --> 21:42.452
The men who live in this apartment,
are they in here?

21:56.091 --> 21:57.509
Whoever it is, they'll go.

21:58.802 --> 22:01.847
Menti. Meyers. Are you there?

22:01.972 --> 22:04.349
That's Forkpah.

22:38.550 --> 22:42.346
Praise God you were not harmed.

22:44.056 --> 22:45.724
You're making the right choice.

22:45.849 --> 22:50.771
It isn't safe to be here any longer.

22:50.896 --> 22:54.274
How can you teach about Jesus Christ
when people's lives are at risk?

22:55.192 --> 22:57.277
Your mothers will be very happy
to see you.

22:57.402 --> 22:59.863
He's not going home.

23:01.615 --> 23:03.784
We're going to teach.

23:03.909 --> 23:04.910
During the war?

23:05.035 --> 23:08.080
Away from the war, where it is safe.

23:08.205 --> 23:10.123
It's not safe in Monrovia, my brother.

23:10.248 --> 23:11.541
It is not safe anywhere.

23:11.667 --> 23:16.088
Then we will leave the country.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.216
- Wait, what?
- He's not kidding.

23:19.341 --> 23:21.635
Are you just gonna pack up and
drag a suitcase to Sierra Leone?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.428
Selli.

23:24.388 --> 23:25.973
Anyone have a better idea?

23:26.098 --> 23:28.558
Lay low. Stay inside.

23:28.684 --> 23:31.687
You can study if you want,
but stay off the streets.

23:31.812 --> 23:33.772
Brother Abubakar.

23:33.897 --> 23:36.024
Stay out of the reach of the rebels.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.235
Look. Stock food and water.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.362
Let's just wait this thing out.

23:40.487 --> 23:41.613
There's no more food.

23:41.738 --> 23:43.281
The water is out, too.

23:43.407 --> 23:44.825
Same with our place.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.160
And power's been gone for weeks.

23:47.285 --> 23:51.248
What if you run into the rebels
just walking down the street?

23:51.373 --> 23:53.000
What if they shoot you
because you're Christian?

23:53.125 --> 23:56.086
Or because you're tall or not,
or for whatever reason?

23:56.211 --> 24:00.632
Or they shoot us through our apartment
door while we're hiding like cowards.

24:00.757 --> 24:03.885
It is not cowardice to survive.

24:04.011 --> 24:06.304
We are not going to Freetown.
It is not an option.

24:06.430 --> 24:07.556
Brother Abubakar.

24:07.681 --> 24:10.475
You could drive them there.

24:12.602 --> 24:14.396
No. No, no, no.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.981
What else can we do?

24:19.151 --> 24:23.947
There are rebels everywhere
in the city and in the jungle.

24:24.072 --> 24:27.200
They're gonna set up roadblocks
and checkpoints

24:27.325 --> 24:30.203
at every intersection
between here and the border.

24:30.328 --> 24:33.206
Just finding petrol will take
a miracle from God.

24:33.331 --> 24:34.541
Let's just wait here until...

24:34.666 --> 24:37.669
We aren't any safer here
than we are in the open air.

24:37.794 --> 24:42.549
I saw a man get shot right in front
of our apartment this morning.

24:42.674 --> 24:45.927
It could have been any of us.

24:49.765 --> 24:52.225
We will use the main road
out of the city.

24:52.350 --> 24:54.811
But I imagine
we can run into trouble here.

24:54.936 --> 24:56.605
Stop. All of you.

24:57.564 --> 25:01.068
This is just too fast. We need to think.

25:01.193 --> 25:04.237
Lives are at stake here, including ours.

25:04.362 --> 25:08.408
I assured President Cunningham
that I was gonna keep you safe.

25:08.533 --> 25:11.870
And he trusts that I do the right thing.

25:11.995 --> 25:15.707
Look, I don't care if you're not gonna
teach another soul ever again.

25:15.832 --> 25:19.086
We are not going to Freetown.

25:21.379 --> 25:23.006
Hymns...

25:23.131 --> 25:25.675
Scriptures...

25:25.801 --> 25:28.720
The Savior...

25:28.845 --> 25:32.808
These were not always a part of my life.

25:32.933 --> 25:37.604
One day, I meet two men
in white shirts and ties

25:37.729 --> 25:39.648
on the streets.

25:39.773 --> 25:42.359
They ask me if they can share a message.

25:42.484 --> 25:43.985
I said no.

25:44.111 --> 25:46.780
It wasn't for me.

25:46.905 --> 25:52.369
Not after some of the things
I have done.

25:52.494 --> 25:55.163
When I turned to leave,

25:55.288 --> 26:01.795
Elder Menti said, "Will you pray for us?

26:01.920 --> 26:05.841
Will you pray for us?"

26:05.966 --> 26:08.510
I didn't know
who these missionaries were.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.096
I've never been to any church before.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.891
I've never even said a prayer before.

26:15.016 --> 26:18.145
But those simple words stuck in my mind.

26:19.688 --> 26:22.399
That night, before I went to bed,

26:22.524 --> 26:25.569
I spoke out loud to God.

26:25.694 --> 26:28.405
For the first time in my life,
I said a prayer.

26:30.615 --> 26:32.450
I didn't even know if I did it right.

26:33.535 --> 26:37.164
I just talked.

26:37.289 --> 26:42.002
And it felt like
I could tell him anything.

26:42.127 --> 26:47.132
It felt like he was
actually listening to me.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.595
It was so easy.

26:51.970 --> 26:56.808
Now, that was the first time
I ever said a prayer.

26:59.227 --> 27:01.730
If you do not have a chance to
share this message with others,

27:01.855 --> 27:04.649
then the rebels have already won.

27:06.151 --> 27:09.571
We don't even know if we can get there,
let alone if we should.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.823
When we leave our apartment
every morning,

27:11.948 --> 27:13.742
we don't always know where we are going.

27:13.867 --> 27:15.994
Revelation doesn't come

27:16.119 --> 27:20.457
when we are hiding in the shadows
or sitting on the ground, asking for it.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.251
It doesn't come that way.

27:23.376 --> 27:27.088
It comes when we are out working,
without knowing where we are going,

27:27.214 --> 27:29.925
constantly taking steps forward.

27:32.385 --> 27:34.763
So, when do we go?

27:34.888 --> 27:37.390
We should sleep
at the mission office tonight,

27:37.515 --> 27:39.893
and then we'll leave
first thing tomorrow morning.

27:40.018 --> 27:43.146
What about Gaye and Nyanforth?

27:43.271 --> 27:44.648
I'll go to Paynesville tomorrow morning

27:44.773 --> 27:46.441
and tell them to meet you
at the mission office.

27:46.566 --> 27:48.735
There's no time to wait.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.112
No one gets left behind.

28:19.975 --> 28:21.601
Thank you, sister.

28:21.726 --> 28:22.852
At your service.

28:28.066 --> 28:29.734
Where did all these people come from?

28:29.859 --> 28:31.778
They are people that feel threatened.

28:32.821 --> 28:36.408
We go with them in the morning
to the northern region,

28:36.533 --> 28:38.159
where it's safer.

28:38.285 --> 28:40.412
You will stay with us.

28:40.537 --> 28:42.872
Thank you, but we cannot
leave the mission.

28:42.998 --> 28:45.500
They're killing the Krahn.

28:45.625 --> 28:49.462
And the rest, they take into camps.

28:49.587 --> 28:51.965
There's not enough food here
for these people.

28:52.090 --> 28:54.384
Not even for tonight.

28:54.509 --> 28:58.805
- We will go and get something to eat.
- No. The rebels are out there.

28:59.180 --> 29:01.474
Please.

29:01.599 --> 29:03.810
We will be fine.

29:03.935 --> 29:05.353
I'll go with you.

29:05.478 --> 29:06.730
Uh, your name.

29:06.855 --> 29:09.107
They will question you.

29:09.232 --> 29:12.110
They will know.

29:15.530 --> 29:17.365
I will go.

29:26.624 --> 29:28.626
Be careful.

29:31.463 --> 29:33.631
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you, too.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.822
Hey! Stop the car!

30:35.360 --> 30:36.653
I will head to the field.

30:36.778 --> 30:37.946
You see what you can find.

30:38.071 --> 30:41.408
- And let's meet back here.
- Okay.

31:48.349 --> 31:50.560
Where is your friend?

31:52.979 --> 31:56.524
He went out to look for food.

31:56.649 --> 31:59.611
And you didn't go with him?

32:05.450 --> 32:08.495
It's not safe for me out there.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.622
Why not?

32:12.123 --> 32:15.210
Some men were taught to hate.

32:15.335 --> 32:17.212
By who?

32:19.756 --> 32:22.926
By men who were hated.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.533
Hey.

32:50.411 --> 32:53.665
Look. There.

32:55.166 --> 32:56.292
Give me your weapon.

32:57.377 --> 32:59.420
What is that?

33:07.679 --> 33:08.930
What is that?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.015
It's that fool over there.

33:19.816 --> 33:20.817
Shoot again.

33:20.942 --> 33:23.278
Is he Krahn?

33:23.403 --> 33:25.029
He's a thief.

33:37.292 --> 33:39.377
What is that?

34:01.316 --> 34:03.109
Give me that.

35:22.689 --> 35:24.607
I'm sorry.

35:32.448 --> 35:35.284
"And then it shall come to pass

35:35.410 --> 35:38.204
that the spirits of those
who are righteous

35:38.329 --> 35:42.834
are received into a state of happiness,
which is called paradise,

35:42.959 --> 35:46.045
a state of rest, a state of peace,

35:46.170 --> 35:48.506
where they shall rest
from all their troubles

35:48.631 --> 35:52.176
and from all care and sorrow."

35:52.301 --> 35:55.096
Alma chapter 40.

35:55.221 --> 35:58.182
"Rest from all their troubles."

35:58.307 --> 36:01.978
Seems difficult to believe
at a time like this.

36:02.103 --> 36:06.733
It seems like at a time like this,
you have to believe.

36:06.858 --> 36:08.359
Sure.

36:08.484 --> 36:11.028
But death is final.

36:11.154 --> 36:13.531
It's a lot of trouble
for you to live through

36:13.656 --> 36:16.868
before you get
to that state of paradise.

36:16.993 --> 36:20.371
It does not say anything
about needing to die

36:20.496 --> 36:24.041
before you can feel paradise.

36:26.669 --> 36:28.671
Do you want to go with them tomorrow?

36:28.796 --> 36:31.299
Don't you?

36:31.424 --> 36:32.717
It's dangerous.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.261
So is staying here.

36:35.386 --> 36:39.390
I'd rather find somewhere
where we can teach

36:39.515 --> 36:42.685
than be here and trapped.

36:42.810 --> 36:45.938
You can stay.
They are only killing Krahns.

36:46.063 --> 36:47.648
No.

36:47.774 --> 36:49.817
We stay together.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.069
What if they catch us?

36:52.195 --> 36:56.449
What if they identify me?

36:56.574 --> 36:58.868
It won't come to that.

36:58.993 --> 37:01.704
If someone asks you where you're from,

37:01.829 --> 37:06.250
say you're from here,
born and raised in Paynesville.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.086
Stand up and be counted.

37:11.214 --> 37:15.261
Stand up, be counted, and lie.

37:17.386 --> 37:20.223
If it means saving your life?

37:24.519 --> 37:27.021
In the moment,

37:27.146 --> 37:29.913
when there is a gun to your head

37:30.414 --> 37:33.845
and the sun is beating down,

37:34.570 --> 37:40.034
you must choose to live or die.

37:42.036 --> 37:45.373
Are you really going to die
just to prove a point?

37:45.498 --> 37:50.586
Think of all the people you'll teach
after this is all done.

37:54.465 --> 37:59.637
The rebels are killing Krahns
just because they can.

37:59.762 --> 38:05.184
They're not the law of Liberia,
the law of God.

38:07.353 --> 38:11.357
I'm not telling you
to betray your tribe.

38:11.482 --> 38:13.526
Just preserve it.

38:13.651 --> 38:16.195
There's nothing wrong with that.

38:22.577 --> 38:26.497
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk.

41:05.906 --> 41:09.744
Well, Gaye, are you sure
you want to do this?

41:09.869 --> 41:11.787
Yeah.

41:49.950 --> 41:51.660
- I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!

41:51.786 --> 41:54.080
Don't shoot!

41:54.205 --> 41:57.333
Let's go. Move!
All of you, move! Let's go!

42:09.470 --> 42:11.931
Go on.

42:23.025 --> 42:26.237
You. Are you Krahn?

42:26.362 --> 42:27.655
No. I'm not Krahn.

42:27.780 --> 42:29.281
- I'm Gio.
- You're lying!

42:29.406 --> 42:30.783
Why? Why would I lie?

42:30.908 --> 42:32.952
Because you fear me.

42:33.994 --> 42:36.122
There's a Krahn dog.

42:43.337 --> 42:45.089
- Gaye?
- Huh.

42:45.214 --> 42:47.007
What are you looking at?

42:47.133 --> 42:49.009
Do you ever think about paradise?

42:49.135 --> 42:50.845
This is not the end.

42:50.970 --> 42:55.683
Do you ever wonder
how it feels like to be there?

42:55.808 --> 42:58.811
And you, little mother?

42:58.936 --> 43:00.688
Are you Krahn?

43:00.813 --> 43:02.481
I'm Krahn.

43:02.606 --> 43:05.276
There's no shame in it.

43:15.619 --> 43:17.955
Gaye.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.832
You should run.

43:19.957 --> 43:21.417
I see my paradise.

43:22.543 --> 43:26.505
It is beyond the river, near the jungle.

43:26.630 --> 43:30.509
Coconut palms and a salty breeze.

43:30.634 --> 43:33.429
I've never seen a more beautiful
place like this.

43:44.273 --> 43:47.276
Where do you come from?

43:47.401 --> 43:51.197
Not... Not Krahn.

43:51.322 --> 43:53.115
Not Krahn.

44:00.623 --> 44:03.000
And you?

44:03.125 --> 44:06.295
Are you a Krahn?

44:10.507 --> 44:12.259
Nyanforth?

44:16.138 --> 44:18.599
Are you a Krahn?

44:18.724 --> 44:20.768
No, I'm not.

44:31.654 --> 44:32.655
You.

44:33.906 --> 44:36.283
Are you a Krahn?

44:41.413 --> 44:42.414
Elder.

44:49.171 --> 44:51.423
Elder is my title.

44:52.758 --> 44:57.096
I am...

44:57.221 --> 45:00.641
an ordained minister of Jesus Christ.

45:10.818 --> 45:13.654
Ansa! Ansa!

45:15.572 --> 45:16.865
Ansa!

45:18.993 --> 45:21.120
These men...

45:21.245 --> 45:23.580
These are good men. I know them.

45:23.706 --> 45:24.999
You know them?

45:25.124 --> 45:27.251
They are from my church.

45:27.376 --> 45:28.627
Let me take them.

45:28.752 --> 45:30.921
- I'll put them to work digging.
- This one is a Krahn.

45:31.046 --> 45:33.465
He will be treated as such.

45:50.941 --> 45:53.444
- Menti?
- Yeah?

45:53.569 --> 45:55.154
We don't have any bread.

45:55.279 --> 45:57.781
What do we have?

45:57.906 --> 46:00.159
Nothing much.

46:00.284 --> 46:01.952
We will make it work.

46:02.077 --> 46:04.204
Then I'll ration it for the five of us.

46:04.330 --> 46:05.956
Seven.

46:10.252 --> 46:12.212
They will come.

46:13.422 --> 46:15.632
We're gonna ration them.

46:15.758 --> 46:19.720
I think we just have to make do
with what we have.

46:19.845 --> 46:21.722
Yes. That's better.

46:21.847 --> 46:23.974
But the food and all that... 'cause...

46:24.099 --> 46:25.601
Oh, no.

46:25.726 --> 46:26.727
No.

46:26.852 --> 46:29.521
So, what do we do?

46:29.646 --> 46:31.774
Maybe we're gonna walk.

46:36.820 --> 46:38.989
Were you born to worry?

46:41.909 --> 46:43.327
Here.

46:47.373 --> 46:49.333
I'm looking for the Elder.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.543
The one who is Krahn.

46:56.006 --> 46:59.134
He used to live near us in the city.

46:59.259 --> 47:00.427
But we have not seen him.

47:00.552 --> 47:01.804
Where?

47:01.929 --> 47:03.972
Tell me where you lived.

47:30.624 --> 47:32.501
Elders?

47:34.503 --> 47:36.880
Elders.

47:38.382 --> 47:40.050
Elders!

48:18.130 --> 48:21.300
You're looking for Elder.

48:29.683 --> 48:31.518
What do you want from this Krahn?

48:46.575 --> 48:48.869
What about you?

48:53.499 --> 48:55.375
Are you a Krahn?

48:56.210 --> 48:58.504
- Huh?
- No.

49:00.255 --> 49:02.841
Lucky us.

49:24.279 --> 49:26.281
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Quick.

49:26.406 --> 49:28.075
Brother Meyers, Brother Menti,
We got to go. We got to go.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.619
Hey, Abubakar, come on.

49:30.744 --> 49:32.079
Guys, we have to go.

49:32.204 --> 49:33.288
We have got to go.

49:33.413 --> 49:36.458
Come on in here for prayers.

49:36.583 --> 49:38.752
Menti.

49:38.877 --> 49:41.380
Why aren't they here?

49:45.092 --> 49:47.636
I'll say it.

49:47.761 --> 49:53.559
Dear God, before we depart,
we ask for thy watchful care.

49:53.684 --> 49:56.061
The journey we now feel prompted to take

49:56.186 --> 49:59.106
require thy protective hands.

49:59.231 --> 50:03.402
We are unsure as to what lies ahead,
but, Lord, we pray for the vehicle,

50:04.527 --> 50:07.322
that it will function properly

50:07.447 --> 50:11.034
and be able to handle
the uncertain terrain.

50:11.159 --> 50:16.498
We pray for thy children who have
sacrificed so much on our behalf.

50:16.623 --> 50:20.586
Help their faith to carry them
through these difficult times.

50:20.711 --> 50:23.171
Bless those who remain,

50:23.297 --> 50:25.799
that their burden may be lightened.

50:25.924 --> 50:28.844
We pray for Gaye and Nyanforth.

50:28.969 --> 50:31.555
We've done our best...

50:33.307 --> 50:36.768
We've done our best to find them,

50:36.893 --> 50:38.645
but have been unsuccessful.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.314
Comfort them, oh, Lord.

50:40.439 --> 50:41.857
Be with them.

50:41.982 --> 50:44.318
Hello? Hello?

50:44.443 --> 50:47.195
Finally, we pray for our driver...

50:47.321 --> 50:48.864
- Is anybody there?
- ...Brother Philip Abubakar.

50:48.989 --> 50:50.032
You must get out.

50:50.157 --> 50:52.909
And for the safety of him
and his family...

50:53.035 --> 50:54.870
They're coming for you... the rebels.

50:54.995 --> 50:56.413
- ...as we strive to do...
- They are not here.

50:56.538 --> 50:59.207
- ...that which is impossible.
- You must leave now.

51:01.877 --> 51:04.004
Elders!

51:05.297 --> 51:07.341
Elders!

51:07.466 --> 51:09.676
I'm so sorry.

51:54.805 --> 51:56.139
Down, down, down. Go down.

52:16.576 --> 52:18.995
Menti? Elders?

52:19.121 --> 52:20.288
Abubakar?

52:20.414 --> 52:23.375
I found them in Paynesville. Let's go.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.502
Elders.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.425
We have to go now.

52:33.051 --> 52:34.720
Brother Momulu,
you need to come with us.

52:34.845 --> 52:38.181
These rebels have nothing for you.

52:38.306 --> 52:40.475
I will stay. They need me.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.936
You have a good heart.
Be strong, my brother.

52:43.061 --> 52:44.855
You needn't worry.

52:44.980 --> 52:46.940
I can't help it.

53:39.284 --> 53:40.994
Where is he?

53:41.119 --> 53:45.165
Now you tell me, or I'll shoot you
right here, right now.

53:45.290 --> 53:47.250
Where is he?

53:52.881 --> 53:54.174
He's been taken to Freetown.

53:54.299 --> 53:56.301
He's not a threat, Ansa.

54:00.764 --> 54:03.809
Get up. You are coming with me.

54:05.227 --> 54:07.103
Come on. Let's go.

54:21.868 --> 54:24.329
- Menti's going to get hungry.
- I am fine.

54:24.454 --> 54:28.041
- He already is.
- I am fine.

54:28.166 --> 54:29.918
This is not going to be long, right?

54:30.043 --> 54:31.837
- Yeah, just two days, brother.
- Two days?!

54:31.962 --> 54:34.631
Oh. Stop for coconuts.

54:34.756 --> 54:35.966
Yeah. Let's do it.

54:36.091 --> 54:37.634
Menti, I thought you said you were fine.

54:37.759 --> 54:41.555
- Who says no to coconuts?
- Nobody does that, you know?

54:44.516 --> 54:47.853
I can use the stones to indicate
to them for checkpoints.

54:47.978 --> 54:50.188
Now, if we're going to...

54:50.313 --> 54:53.149
Hey, guys, we got some more coconuts.

54:53.275 --> 54:54.317
- Selli.
- Yeah?

54:54.442 --> 54:56.820
Here's your coconut.

54:56.945 --> 54:58.989
Okay, so that's all the same.

54:59.114 --> 55:00.240
Guys, come around.

55:00.365 --> 55:03.451
Guys, guys, guys, come see.
Come see. Come here.

55:03.577 --> 55:06.204
Okay.

55:06.329 --> 55:08.373
We are right here.
That's our current position.

55:08.498 --> 55:10.542
And, now, we're going to meet
these three NPFL checkpoints.

55:10.667 --> 55:13.003
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll go down this bridge.

55:13.128 --> 55:14.170
There's a river.

55:14.296 --> 55:17.465
So as soon as we turn,
we'll get to the river.

55:17.591 --> 55:20.594
So we'll have to cross it
and then move to the main interstate.

55:20.719 --> 55:22.262
- That's Freetown?
- Yes.

55:22.387 --> 55:24.764
Somewhere right here. Yeah.

55:24.890 --> 55:27.851
I don't know. Is this our plan?

55:27.976 --> 55:30.186
- And is it the map?
- Yeah, that's the map.

55:30.312 --> 55:32.480
Look, let's take this as...

55:32.606 --> 55:35.692
It's not to scale, but at least
it can explain something.

55:35.817 --> 55:38.403
I know Freetown is supposed to be here.

55:38.528 --> 55:39.988
Freetown, Freetown, Freetown.

55:40.113 --> 55:41.281
- Freetown.
- Right here. Yeah.

55:41.406 --> 55:42.866
Okay.

55:43.783 --> 55:45.785
What is the difference
between this and that?

55:45.911 --> 55:48.663
I don't know any sign that would show,
but I know Freetown's right there.

55:48.788 --> 55:51.166
This is Free...
Let's say that is Freetown.

55:52.083 --> 55:54.544
There's a difference between
this location and this.

55:54.669 --> 55:56.254
- Okay, Freetown is here.
- That's fine. Whatever.

55:56.379 --> 55:58.381
- That's Freetown.
- Are you guys okay? Any questions?

55:58.506 --> 56:01.176
The rebels, are they looking for Krahn?

56:02.427 --> 56:04.721
The rebels are there to cause trouble.

56:04.846 --> 56:09.601
Most of them are there for the money,
and then some are there for food.

56:09.726 --> 56:14.147
And obviously, a few of them
have been paid to report the Krahn.

56:14.272 --> 56:16.107
Or shoot them.

56:16.232 --> 56:20.111
Elder Gaye, we won't let that happen.

56:21.696 --> 56:23.698
Okay, so we need to get going now.

56:23.823 --> 56:24.991
Have to get going.

56:28.411 --> 56:29.871
We need to go.

56:35.877 --> 56:38.046
Have faith, brother.

57:26.720 --> 57:30.765
- Nobody say anything. I'll handle this.
- But what if they ask if we're Krahn?

57:30.890 --> 57:33.351
- Or any question why...
- Just keep your mouth shut.

57:33.476 --> 57:34.686
Not a word, any of you.

57:34.811 --> 57:37.230
Hey, someone is coming. Stop!

57:37.355 --> 57:39.941
Stop the car! Stop the car.

57:53.079 --> 57:54.998
You want some water?

57:57.125 --> 57:58.585
How many are in there?

58:00.128 --> 58:01.546
There are seven of us in here.

58:46.007 --> 58:48.676
We're looking for a Krahn.

58:59.312 --> 59:00.772
We have a message for you.

59:04.109 --> 59:05.819
Have you heard of the restored gospel?

59:07.403 --> 59:12.367
We are missionaries of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

59:12.492 --> 59:13.910
When Christ was on the Earth,

59:14.035 --> 59:17.038
he established a church
with the priesthood authority.

59:17.163 --> 59:21.793
But the authority was removed
after the 12 apostles were killed.

59:21.918 --> 59:25.338
Many years later,
Christ restored his gospel

59:25.463 --> 59:26.756
with the priesthood power

59:26.881 --> 59:30.176
through a prophet
by the name Joseph Smith.

59:30.301 --> 59:33.304
Go on. Off.

59:33.429 --> 59:36.766
If you receive his gospel
and repent, you will be happy.

59:36.891 --> 59:39.811
We'd love to share more
with you and your friends.

59:39.936 --> 59:41.813
Wow.

59:41.938 --> 59:42.981
What?

59:43.106 --> 59:44.983
We're supposed to open
our mouth, aren't we?

59:45.108 --> 59:46.401
Yes, of course.

59:46.526 --> 59:48.153
That was really fine. Seriously.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.806
We will be okay, brother.

01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:20.310
It was supposed to drop by now.

01:00:20.435 --> 01:00:23.146
Did you serve a mission, Philip?

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:26.065
No. I joined the church
after I got married.

01:00:26.191 --> 01:00:29.444
How did you find the church?

01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:33.698
You know, before I joined the church,

01:00:33.823 --> 01:00:40.038
I would hear about the Mormons
and their evil and strange ways.

01:00:40.163 --> 01:00:42.790
It was never a good thing.

01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:45.710
Then one day, I see this young man

01:00:45.835 --> 01:00:50.298
walking by the streets,
teaching people about God.

01:00:50.423 --> 01:00:52.926
Then I started to pay close attention.

01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:55.220
But it was never like people would say.

01:00:55.345 --> 01:00:59.515
And even when people would not
listen to them, they could...

01:00:59.641 --> 01:01:03.061
They would even show kindness
and sometimes even help.

01:01:04.938 --> 01:01:06.731
Then I thought to myself,

01:01:06.856 --> 01:01:12.695
"What type of evil would
compel people to do such good?"

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.573
I just couldn't figure it out.

01:01:15.698 --> 01:01:17.200
It didn't make sense to me.

01:01:18.785 --> 01:01:20.703
Cognitive dissonance.

01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:22.413
Yeah.

01:01:22.538 --> 01:01:24.874
Confusion.

01:01:24.999 --> 01:01:29.379
When you learn a truth that conflicts
with what you already believe,

01:01:29.504 --> 01:01:32.340
your mind isn't comfortable with it.

01:01:34.634 --> 01:01:37.095
You know, the church used
to have a policy

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:41.724
that excluded Africans
from the priesthood.

01:01:43.017 --> 01:01:49.857
We were banned, not allowed, denied.

01:01:50.817 --> 01:01:55.822
I remember learning about it
after joining the church.

01:01:55.947 --> 01:01:58.157
Here I was,

01:01:58.283 --> 01:02:03.204
one of the first Liberians
to be baptized into the church.

01:02:03.329 --> 01:02:05.623
One of the first priesthood holders

01:02:05.748 --> 01:02:07.792
in the country.

01:02:10.044 --> 01:02:14.632
The priesthood has changed my life
more than I could ever hope for.

01:02:22.265 --> 01:02:24.809
Talk about confusion.

01:02:28.229 --> 01:02:31.941
Doesn't God love all his children?

01:02:32.066 --> 01:02:36.571
Why would his organization,
which is truly led by a prophet,

01:02:36.696 --> 01:02:41.576
have such a racist policy?

01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:44.495
I couldn't get my head around it.

01:02:45.872 --> 01:02:47.790
Cognitive dissonance.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:51.461
But you did.

01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:54.172
God allows us to change.

01:02:54.297 --> 01:02:55.882
He wants us to change.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:58.843
The power of the atonement

01:02:58.968 --> 01:03:03.056
is that Christ died for everyone.

01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:07.247
Being able to change, to improve,

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:10.255
to move forward,

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.982
it is for everyone.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.614
When one person changes for good,

01:03:19.739 --> 01:03:24.744
God forgives and rejoices.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:27.538
You know, it felt like
the same way when I joined.

01:03:27.663 --> 01:03:29.499
How long ago was that?

01:03:29.624 --> 01:03:32.043
That was about five years ago.

01:03:32.168 --> 01:03:34.379
Five years.

01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:37.590
Now look at where we are.

01:03:40.635 --> 01:03:42.637
Worst mistake ever.

01:04:12.208 --> 01:04:15.253
There were some missionaries driving
on this road. Did you see them?

01:04:15.378 --> 01:04:17.213
There were some missionaries
all in white.

01:04:17.338 --> 01:04:20.341
How long ago did they pass through?

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:22.969
Maybe an hour ago.

01:04:23.094 --> 01:04:25.513
Lift the gate. Lift the gate.

01:04:51.747 --> 01:04:53.875
They need you.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.210
And what about you and your mother?

01:04:56.335 --> 01:04:58.588
I'll care for her, as usual.

01:04:58.713 --> 01:05:01.007
We could keep her in the mission office

01:05:01.132 --> 01:05:03.259
or even in the church.

01:05:04.844 --> 01:05:06.762
Philip, they're here to teach,

01:05:06.888 --> 01:05:09.140
and you cannot ask them
to waste their time.

01:05:09.265 --> 01:05:13.227
They should go back to their families,
move on with their lives

01:05:13.352 --> 01:05:16.731
instead of being
a horrible burden on everyone.

01:05:16.856 --> 01:05:17.982
Burden?

01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:20.693
Is it a burden to serve?

01:05:20.818 --> 01:05:24.697
Is it a burden to help someone in need?

01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:29.660
You don't pray to have more faith
and just expect it to come.

01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:04.820
- Can we get through?
- Unh-unh.

01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:07.240
Not unless we move it out ourselves.

01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.702
I'll go have a look.

01:07:51.677 --> 01:07:55.431
They're all passed out.
Meyers, come help me.

01:07:56.682 --> 01:07:58.684
Don't make any noise.

01:07:59.894 --> 01:08:01.437
Here.

01:08:01.562 --> 01:08:03.688
What are you doing with these?

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:06.609
Saving lives.

01:08:15.368 --> 01:08:17.870
I'll go out and help them.

01:08:17.995 --> 01:08:19.412
No, no, no. This is faster.

01:08:19.537 --> 01:08:21.791
We need to be ready to go
if they wake up.

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:26.295
They're not waking up.

01:08:43.104 --> 01:08:45.022
Hurry.

01:08:57.326 --> 01:09:00.746
No, no, no. Go put it back.
Go put it back. Go.

01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:15.386
Is someone there?

01:09:17.095 --> 01:09:18.430
- Menti, freeze!
- Hey, stop!

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:19.974
Freeze!

01:09:20.099 --> 01:09:21.684
Hey, hey. Stop!

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:22.852
Menti!

01:09:22.977 --> 01:09:24.395
Meyers, get in the car.
He's going to shoot.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.479
- Menti!
- Hey, stop!

01:09:26.604 --> 01:09:28.524
Start the car.

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:30.401
Where are the keys?

01:09:32.944 --> 01:09:34.738
- Can you be any more louder?
- I'm sorry.

01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:36.448
I didn't know
it would fall apart like that.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:39.868
But wait, how did you know
he wouldn't shoot?

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:43.706
Because you can't shoot
what you don't have.

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:48.836
- What are you doing with that?
- It's okay, brother.

01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:52.840
Brother Philip, we'll give it
to someone in need.

01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:08.272
Abubakar, we should pull over.

01:10:08.397 --> 01:10:10.357
We need to get some rest.

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:24.288
So, we're going to sleep here,
and everyone takes watch for an hour.

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:26.165
- 90 minutes.
- Why does it matter?

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:29.293
Because a full R.E.M. cycle is
90 minutes, and it's more healthful.

01:10:29.418 --> 01:10:31.670
- Okay, whatever.
- So, where are we sleeping?

01:10:31.796 --> 01:10:33.047
- Where are we sleeping?
- Just find a spot.

01:10:33.172 --> 01:10:35.090
- Who takes watch first?
- Where are we sleeping?

01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:36.425
I'll go. I'll watch first.

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.302
You watch first. Okay, good.

01:10:38.427 --> 01:10:40.805
We'll just make camp here.

01:10:43.516 --> 01:10:45.017
I'll make a bed.

01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:46.602
Everybody okay?

01:10:46.727 --> 01:10:47.603
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:47.728 --> 01:10:49.522
Do not disturb me.

01:11:42.575 --> 01:11:44.910
It's my turn to watch.

01:11:49.832 --> 01:11:51.625
You're gonna need this.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:56.130
Nyanforth said you were
face-to-face with a Krahn killer.

01:11:57.298 --> 01:11:59.091
Momulu saved us.

01:11:59.216 --> 01:12:01.594
His timing was lucky.

01:12:01.719 --> 01:12:03.762
He interfered?

01:12:03.888 --> 01:12:05.514
Yes.

01:12:06.724 --> 01:12:09.476
Maybe there is hope for him.

01:12:09.602 --> 01:12:11.937
All in God's time.

01:12:12.897 --> 01:12:17.151
I was standing there
at the end of this row of people.

01:12:17.276 --> 01:12:21.864
I watched as the guard
interrogated each person.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:24.283
I kept wondering,

01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:27.745
"Is it fair for anyone
to die like this?"

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:32.958
It was just as Nyanforth
had suggested the night before,

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:38.672
being faced with the choice
to live or to die.

01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:43.552
I was ready to lie
when the question came.

01:12:43.677 --> 01:12:47.848
I wanted to be brave and tell the truth.

01:12:49.391 --> 01:12:53.687
But there was an old woman before us.

01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:55.940
She was brave.

01:12:58.567 --> 01:13:01.820
But he shot her without blinking.

01:13:02.988 --> 01:13:05.532
I didn't want to be brave after that.

01:13:05.658 --> 01:13:09.578
It didn't seem worth it.

01:13:10.829 --> 01:13:13.791
I was afraid.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:16.627
You should not feel bad about that.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.051
Scripture says, "Fear not."

01:13:24.176 --> 01:13:29.431
Isaiah, Samuel, Moroni.

01:13:29.556 --> 01:13:33.644
Look at where you are
and what you're doing.

01:13:33.769 --> 01:13:37.481
You could have
stayed in the city and hid.

01:13:37.606 --> 01:13:40.818
But you are here,

01:13:40.943 --> 01:13:45.155
moving forward, trying to live.

01:13:47.449 --> 01:13:52.663
Is it brave just to try to live?

01:13:52.788 --> 01:13:55.499
It is brave to face your fears.

01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:06.552
Yeah.

01:14:18.397 --> 01:14:19.523
Soldier.

01:14:19.648 --> 01:14:22.860
Lift gate. Lift gate.

01:15:25.005 --> 01:15:28.258
Do you see something?

01:15:28.383 --> 01:15:31.261
Just an abandoned car.

01:15:31.386 --> 01:15:32.971
Why are you protecting him?

01:15:33.097 --> 01:15:35.474
Protecting who, Ansa?

01:15:37.017 --> 01:15:39.895
Liberia will suffer for Doe's actions.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.398
He must be stopped.

01:15:43.524 --> 01:15:46.944
Doe favors his people above others.

01:15:47.069 --> 01:15:50.239
He stole the power of the government,

01:15:50.364 --> 01:15:52.616
and he is there illegally.

01:15:52.741 --> 01:15:54.118
He holds it over us,

01:15:54.243 --> 01:15:57.955
giving positions of leadership
to his people.

01:15:59.164 --> 01:16:03.252
The Krahns think
they are all better than us.

01:16:05.838 --> 01:16:09.800
This boy you're protecting
is one of them.

01:16:12.845 --> 01:16:16.140
They are responsible for this war.

01:16:16.265 --> 01:16:20.394
They are responsible
for the death of my father,

01:16:20.519 --> 01:16:25.816
my mother, and my two younger brothers.

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:29.444
I will not stop
hunting and killing Krahns

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:33.031
until they are all gone.

01:16:34.867 --> 01:16:37.494
Liberia will not be well with them.

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:39.454
Never.

01:16:46.086 --> 01:16:48.255
Hatred breeds hatred.

01:16:51.133 --> 01:16:53.385
We'll catch them at the border.

01:17:09.193 --> 01:17:11.195
- Good morning, Menti.
- You're wearing a tie?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.362
Yeah.

01:17:12.487 --> 01:17:14.531
- You want some breakfast?
- Everybody happy now?

01:17:14.656 --> 01:17:15.949
Did you sleep well?

01:17:16.074 --> 01:17:17.868
Ooh, that stinks.

01:17:17.993 --> 01:17:19.411
Let's go over there.

01:17:19.536 --> 01:17:21.872
- Want some breakfast?
- Not if it's yams.

01:17:21.997 --> 01:17:23.624
I think I slept on it wrong.

01:17:30.923 --> 01:17:32.758
One more day until we are free.

01:17:32.883 --> 01:17:34.968
One more day until we can teach.

01:17:35.093 --> 01:17:37.846
One more day until this car can rest.

01:18:12.172 --> 01:18:13.382
Abubakar, slow down.

01:18:13.507 --> 01:18:15.217
- Slow down.
- Lots of kids here.

01:18:15.342 --> 01:18:16.718
Slow down. Slow down.

01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:24.851
- Don't fight. Don't fight. Don't fight.
- Hey.

01:18:24.977 --> 01:18:26.061
Watch it. Watch it.

01:18:26.186 --> 01:18:27.854
Hey, hey, hey.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.106
These are some kids.

01:18:29.231 --> 01:18:31.024
- Tell them something, Selli.
- What?

01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:33.819
Teach them something, anything.

01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:35.279
Take the Book of Mormon.

01:18:35.404 --> 01:18:36.947
This is Joseph Smith.

01:18:37.072 --> 01:18:40.075
He was a prophet. He could hear God.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.035
Selli, come down. I know you're happy.
Come on.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.746
Okay, here you go. Take this one.

01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:47.624
This is Jesus Christ.
He's the Son of God.

01:18:47.749 --> 01:18:50.711
Come here. Come here.
Everybody, come around.

01:18:50.836 --> 01:18:53.255
Be careful. Yes. You are getting there.

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.465
- Teach them something. Anything.
- Take the Book of Mormon.

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:58.593
- Give him one.
- Step out, step out.

01:18:58.719 --> 01:18:59.803
- Watch out. Watch out.
- Watches over you.

01:18:59.928 --> 01:19:01.805
No, no, no, no, that's my tie.

01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:04.224
Give one to your friends.
Yeah, and you, too. Okay.

01:19:04.349 --> 01:19:06.226
And you, and you, and you. Okay.

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:08.061
That's it. And you.

01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:10.397
And everybody.
He watches over all of us.

01:19:10.522 --> 01:19:11.815
We are finally teaching.

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.567
I'll be fine. I don't care. Just go.

01:19:13.692 --> 01:19:15.360
No matter what,
he's always there for us.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:16.611
Come on, Selli. Get back in.

01:19:16.737 --> 01:19:19.364
- He loves you.
- He'll always loves you.

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:20.741
Come on.

01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:00.155
What's going on?

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.451
The puddle.
I bet it's all mud underneath.

01:20:04.576 --> 01:20:06.328
Can you go around?

01:20:07.913 --> 01:20:11.041
Everything's marshy and wet.

01:20:11.166 --> 01:20:12.626
Meyers, let's take a look.

01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:14.294
Okay.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:21.927
Huh.

01:20:24.429 --> 01:20:26.765
I think we can make it through.

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:28.600
Doesn't look bad, that side.

01:20:28.725 --> 01:20:30.519
- Think so?
- Yeah.

01:20:30.644 --> 01:20:33.855
Abubakar, can you drive through it?

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:36.858
Yeah. I've done it once.

01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:48.161
Wow.

01:20:48.286 --> 01:20:50.163
- Let's do it. I think we can make it.
- Guys, guys, guys.

01:20:50.288 --> 01:20:52.249
If the water has been sitting
for a while,

01:20:52.374 --> 01:20:53.792
the ground will be very, very soft.

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:56.253
Meyers, nobody cares. Let's just do it.

01:20:58.505 --> 01:20:59.589
Then go ahead.

01:20:59.714 --> 01:21:01.675
I will walk.

01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:07.597
Well?

01:21:07.722 --> 01:21:09.266
Yeah. We'll go, then.

01:21:10.976 --> 01:21:13.895
Just give it enough gas,
and we'll go right through.

01:21:17.065 --> 01:21:18.567
Have faith, brother.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.028
God, I pray to you, better be right.

01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:30.620
Come on, now.

01:21:30.745 --> 01:21:32.497
Come on. Yeah.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.583
More gas, more gas, more gas.

01:21:34.708 --> 01:21:37.002
- Step on it.
- More gas.

01:21:37.127 --> 01:21:38.336
Let's go. Let's go.

01:21:38.462 --> 01:21:39.880
- Abubakar, let's go.
- Do it.

01:21:41.715 --> 01:21:44.092
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:02.486
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:02.611 --> 01:22:03.695
Oh, that was good.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.574
Shh. Here he comes. Here he comes.

01:22:07.699 --> 01:22:10.535
Nobody say anything.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.787
Hey, wipe off before you get in.

01:22:12.913 --> 01:22:15.624
Well, we don't have the faith
to walk on water.

01:22:15.749 --> 01:22:17.876
But we sure can drive through it.

01:22:31.389 --> 01:22:33.600
Rebels again?

01:22:33.725 --> 01:22:34.976
These ones look serious.

01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:36.269
Rebel or national?

01:22:36.394 --> 01:22:38.438
Does it matter?

01:22:38.563 --> 01:22:41.441
Nyanforth, don't say anything.

01:22:46.988 --> 01:22:48.281
Why so many in the car?

01:22:48.406 --> 01:22:50.575
We don't have a church van.

01:22:52.327 --> 01:22:54.371
You have to pay for each passenger.

01:22:55.497 --> 01:22:57.666
We have very little money on us.

01:22:57.791 --> 01:22:59.417
Huh?

01:22:59.543 --> 01:23:02.921
Pay. Or turn around and go back.

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:04.172
Do we even have money?

01:23:04.297 --> 01:23:07.217
- Bring out the little we have.
- Yeah.

01:23:10.011 --> 01:23:11.429
I have a toothbrush.

01:23:11.555 --> 01:23:14.599
Toothbrush? What are they
gonna use a toothbrush for?

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:16.309
All right. All right.

01:23:16.434 --> 01:23:17.936
Quiet.

01:23:18.061 --> 01:23:19.104
What are we missing?

01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:21.147
- I need this pen.
- For what?

01:23:21.273 --> 01:23:23.233
No, this is good.

01:23:27.404 --> 01:23:29.656
This is all we have.

01:23:38.039 --> 01:23:39.499
Uh, this is enough for five.

01:23:42.127 --> 01:23:44.337
Wait, wait. Here.

01:23:44.462 --> 01:23:46.923
- Please. Here.
- That's for petrol.

01:23:47.048 --> 01:23:48.383
- Take. Please take it.
- Okay.

01:23:48.508 --> 01:23:49.551
- Six.
- We don't have any more money.

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:51.052
That's it. That's all we have.

01:23:51.177 --> 01:23:53.638
- My friend, I said six.
- Wait.

01:23:53.763 --> 01:23:56.308
- I have something.
- What?

01:24:26.379 --> 01:24:28.590
Forkpah, Forkpah, Forkpah,
pay attention.

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:30.008
Look at this.

01:24:30.133 --> 01:24:35.138
Three, two, one.

01:24:35.263 --> 01:24:37.057
Dead.

01:24:37.182 --> 01:24:41.519
God. That's the last drop.

01:24:43.438 --> 01:24:45.106
All right.

01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:46.608
I knew it, chosen ones.

01:24:46.733 --> 01:24:48.735
This is the end of the line.

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.278
We are not there yet.

01:24:50.403 --> 01:24:52.238
I know we are not there yet.

01:24:52.364 --> 01:24:55.200
But this is how far
your faith will get us.

01:24:56.910 --> 01:25:00.246
So much for, "We will be okay, brother.

01:25:00.372 --> 01:25:02.457
- We will be okay."
- We will be okay, brother.

01:25:02.582 --> 01:25:05.210
Yeah, we'll be okay.
We'll be okay walking to Freetown.

01:25:05.335 --> 01:25:08.672
Even a traveling band of miracle workers
cannot predict everything.

01:25:08.797 --> 01:25:10.799
Oh, Brother Abubakar, take it easy.
Where is your faith?

01:25:10.924 --> 01:25:14.427
Can't you see I'm easy? I'm so easy.
I've got faith... loads of it.

01:25:14.552 --> 01:25:16.805
- I was just saying if I just...
- Guys.

01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:19.724
There's a petrol station right here.

01:25:21.184 --> 01:25:22.560
You hear that?

01:25:22.686 --> 01:25:24.854
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:24.979 --> 01:25:26.147
- Come on.
- Brother Abubakar.

01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:28.566
- Abubakar.
- Faith. Faith!

01:25:28.692 --> 01:25:30.276
Let's go!

01:25:36.241 --> 01:25:37.659
Okay, it's okay.

01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:40.453
They were asking for
$85 a gallon in Paynesville.

01:25:40.578 --> 01:25:43.248
That's $85 more than we have.

01:25:43.373 --> 01:25:45.458
Just say a prayer
and hope they are kind to us.

01:26:02.684 --> 01:26:05.520
You have been traveling for long?

01:26:05.645 --> 01:26:07.814
Yes, sir. We've been traveling for long.

01:26:07.939 --> 01:26:10.567
And it's not been easy.

01:26:10.692 --> 01:26:13.862
Not at all. It's not been easy.

01:26:22.162 --> 01:26:24.748
We will need your help.

01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:30.295
We want to buy petrol,
but we don't have any money.

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:35.759
We can give anything...
everything that we have.

01:26:37.802 --> 01:26:40.472
You've been traveling with your sons?

01:26:41.973 --> 01:26:43.767
They are not my sons.

01:26:43.892 --> 01:26:45.310
Not your sons?

01:26:45.435 --> 01:26:50.106
I guess, in a way, you can say they are.

01:26:50.231 --> 01:26:55.403
And you have all of them
in that tiny car?

01:26:55.528 --> 01:26:56.696
Yes.

01:26:56.821 --> 01:26:58.490
All the way from Monrovia.

01:26:58.615 --> 01:27:00.492
Monrovia?

01:27:00.617 --> 01:27:02.619
And where are you going?

01:27:02.744 --> 01:27:04.704
Freetown.

01:27:07.123 --> 01:27:10.710
How far away from the border?

01:27:10.835 --> 01:27:12.212
Oh, not far.

01:27:12.337 --> 01:27:14.839
But you must be careful, hmm?

01:27:14.964 --> 01:27:17.634
The road is very bad.

01:27:17.759 --> 01:27:22.138
And even though you are close,
you still have to drive slowly.

01:27:22.263 --> 01:27:24.182
I will do that, sir.

01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:27.852
And soon, you will catch up
with your friend.

01:27:29.771 --> 01:27:32.649
Earlier on, a man came here

01:27:32.774 --> 01:27:35.610
looking for a bunch of men wearing white

01:27:35.735 --> 01:27:40.907
and claiming he was very anxious
to catch up with you.

01:27:43.326 --> 01:27:45.328
Don't worry.

01:27:45.453 --> 01:27:47.288
I will help you, hmm?

01:27:47.413 --> 01:27:49.624
I will help you.

01:28:05.098 --> 01:28:06.391
Open the trunk.

01:28:07.725 --> 01:28:09.310
- Give it to him.
- What?

01:28:09.435 --> 01:28:11.437
All of it.

01:28:22.323 --> 01:28:25.952
That should be enough to take you there.

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:11.956
We are not far from the border.

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:16.127
What if you don't find them, Ansa?

01:29:16.252 --> 01:29:19.339
- We will find them.
- And what if we don't?

01:29:19.464 --> 01:29:25.511
We must find them because if we don't...

01:29:25.637 --> 01:29:27.388
I will deal with you.

01:29:27.513 --> 01:29:29.307
I'll make sure that you

01:29:29.432 --> 01:29:34.187
and any other person
you care about wish that we had.

01:29:47.158 --> 01:29:48.368
Help me.

01:29:48.493 --> 01:29:49.494
Is it okay now?

01:29:49.619 --> 01:29:51.788
Yeah, it's okay. We're good to go, guys.

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.214
Philip, let's go faster.

01:30:01.339 --> 01:30:02.966
Look, I can't go any faster.

01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:05.259
We have to be careful of the tires.

01:30:05.385 --> 01:30:07.720
There are rocks all over the place.

01:30:07.845 --> 01:30:09.347
I wish you guys could be
up front here to see it.

01:30:09.472 --> 01:30:12.558
If I should get out and walk,
we could get there faster.

01:30:17.605 --> 01:30:19.732
Hey!

01:30:21.567 --> 01:30:24.862
Keep going. Now we're
really making good time.

01:30:24.988 --> 01:30:26.781
- Philip.
- Yes?

01:30:26.906 --> 01:30:27.949
The rocks are very small.

01:30:28.074 --> 01:30:29.742
Oh, look. Look.
We just got two more bumps.

01:30:29.867 --> 01:30:32.495
No.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:34.789
It is still bumpy.

01:30:34.914 --> 01:30:36.541
- The rebels.
- Abubakar.

01:30:36.666 --> 01:30:37.667
Guys, come, come.

01:30:39.335 --> 01:30:41.295
- It's not good for my shoes.
- Did you see that one?

01:30:45.133 --> 01:30:46.509
I can't believe Abubakar
is making us do this.

01:30:46.634 --> 01:30:48.261
Philip.

01:30:48.386 --> 01:30:50.221
You're a good driver.

01:30:50.346 --> 01:30:52.640
- Hey, need some help?
- Hello.

01:30:52.765 --> 01:30:55.143
You have a good driver.

01:30:55.268 --> 01:30:57.103
He's a good man.

01:30:57.854 --> 01:30:58.938
Everywhere is clear.

01:31:00.398 --> 01:31:03.317
Philip, don't try me. I'm warning you.

01:31:03.443 --> 01:31:05.528
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- This is your last chance.

01:31:05.653 --> 01:31:08.823
Abubakar, you should get out
so that you can jog.

01:31:08.948 --> 01:31:10.366
How was the exercise?

01:31:10.491 --> 01:31:11.576
Tolerable.

01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:12.994
Scoot over.

01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:15.413
I can't take this.

01:31:17.957 --> 01:31:18.958
Thank you.

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:21.085
Next time, I'll drive. You jog.

01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:23.046
I think Menti's hungry.

01:31:28.718 --> 01:31:30.928
I'm ready for this trip
to be over, guys.

01:31:31.054 --> 01:31:33.056
Endure to the end, brother.

01:31:33.181 --> 01:31:36.809
I don't think my end
can endure much more.

01:31:36.934 --> 01:31:39.562
I wouldn't be opposed to a shower.

01:31:39.687 --> 01:31:41.189
I wouldn't be opposed
to you having a shower.

01:31:41.314 --> 01:31:43.066
When do you think
things will be back to normal?

01:31:43.191 --> 01:31:45.359
- Normal?
- Yes.

01:31:45.485 --> 01:31:46.736
Define "normal."

01:31:46.861 --> 01:31:48.446
I don't know.

01:31:48.571 --> 01:31:53.576
We can go outside and not talk about
all the things that we have seen.

01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:57.747
The rebels, the killings,
and the hatred.

01:31:57.872 --> 01:31:59.082
Never.

01:31:59.207 --> 01:32:02.210
There will always be more of it
if we keep allowing it.

01:32:04.045 --> 01:32:05.463
That's bleak, man.

01:32:05.588 --> 01:32:07.298
He's right.

01:32:07.423 --> 01:32:10.009
Maybe. Just seems bleak.

01:32:10.134 --> 01:32:13.346
It is if you see it that way.

01:32:13.471 --> 01:32:15.389
But the fact is

01:32:15.515 --> 01:32:19.852
there are going to be permanent
consequences to all our actions.

01:32:19.977 --> 01:32:22.772
The families that were displaced,

01:32:22.897 --> 01:32:27.026
the lives that were lost...

01:32:27.151 --> 01:32:29.320
Those things
can never be back to normal.

01:32:29.445 --> 01:32:32.323
And there will always be more of it...

01:32:32.448 --> 01:32:37.578
more fighting, more wars, more racism.

01:32:37.703 --> 01:32:42.083
Nothing that can be done
can make that better.

01:32:42.208 --> 01:32:45.294
But you cannot argue over spilled water.

01:32:45.419 --> 01:32:49.090
You cannot dwell
on the injustice of the past,

01:32:49.215 --> 01:32:52.510
but rather anticipate
hope of the future.

01:33:11.946 --> 01:33:13.197
Elders, look.

01:33:14.615 --> 01:33:17.827
If we hurry, we can make it before dark.
Look. Just get your passports ready.

01:33:19.203 --> 01:33:21.956
Anyone need their bags?

01:33:22.957 --> 01:33:24.417
Anyone?

01:33:24.542 --> 01:33:25.710
Menti?

01:33:25.835 --> 01:33:26.919
Selli? Anyone?

01:33:27.044 --> 01:33:28.754
Get your papers ready.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.757
Anyone need their bag?

01:33:31.883 --> 01:33:33.259
Forkpah?

01:33:33.384 --> 01:33:34.886
- Brother Abubakar.
- Nyanforth.

01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:37.263
Yes?

01:33:58.242 --> 01:34:01.078
What were you thinking?!

01:34:01.204 --> 01:34:03.581
That you don't have a passport
to get across the border?!

01:34:03.706 --> 01:34:06.959
What, you think you could just show up
and shout scripture, sing a hymn,

01:34:07.084 --> 01:34:09.045
and they'll let you cross?

01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:11.839
- That is not the way things work!
- We didn't know.

01:34:11.964 --> 01:34:14.217
Some of us have never left
the country before.

01:34:14.342 --> 01:34:16.385
Clearly! And we aren't
gonna tell them that!

01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:19.305
"Sorry, forgive us that we're
not abiding by your laws.

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:21.933
We've never left the country."

01:34:23.142 --> 01:34:24.268
I've been traveling for two days

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:27.271
with barely enough sleep
and barely enough food,

01:34:27.396 --> 01:34:30.858
listening to your miracle stories
and faith-promoting coincidences.

01:34:30.983 --> 01:34:33.444
And yet, not one of you
would just sit down to think

01:34:33.569 --> 01:34:35.363
that if you would just take
a little time to prepare,

01:34:35.488 --> 01:34:40.701
then God wouldn't have to work
so hard to watch out for you!

01:34:54.924 --> 01:34:56.550
Look. I'm...

01:34:56.676 --> 01:34:59.762
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

01:34:59.887 --> 01:35:02.640
It's just that we've worked so hard,

01:35:02.765 --> 01:35:06.769
and a lot has happened
to get us this far.

01:35:06.894 --> 01:35:12.066
And it's been, like,
miracle after miracle.

01:35:13.818 --> 01:35:16.153
Then why are you doubting?

01:35:19.907 --> 01:35:23.369
Is faith supposed to be this exhausting?

01:35:26.038 --> 01:35:28.457
Let's finish this.

01:36:09.874 --> 01:36:12.418
You mind telling me
how this fits into the plan?

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.841
There's nothing
we could have done differently.

01:36:18.966 --> 01:36:23.137
All the preparation in the world
wouldn't have opened this bridge for us.

01:36:23.262 --> 01:36:26.098
So, what do we do?

01:36:27.767 --> 01:36:33.064
We find a place to sleep
and head back in the morning.

01:36:46.744 --> 01:36:48.162
So, the scripture teaches us

01:36:48.287 --> 01:36:50.706
that in the deal of faith
among the children of men,

01:36:50.831 --> 01:36:52.792
God can do a miracle of wonder.

01:36:52.917 --> 01:36:56.295
Therefore, he showed not himself
until after they had faith.

01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.672
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
- Yes, of course.

01:36:58.798 --> 01:37:00.883
I want to show you.

01:37:04.762 --> 01:37:06.639
Will you be willing to pray for peace?

01:37:06.764 --> 01:37:08.557
Definitely, I will.

01:37:13.479 --> 01:37:17.316
At least we got to see
Sierra Leone, sort of.

01:37:17.441 --> 01:37:19.527
Yeah.

01:37:19.652 --> 01:37:23.989
But would the Lord bring us
this far only to turn us away?

01:37:24.115 --> 01:37:26.700
Did we do all we can?

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:36.460
Philip?

01:37:36.585 --> 01:37:38.796
Where are you going?

01:37:38.921 --> 01:37:41.924
Just going for a walk.

01:37:42.049 --> 01:37:44.677
Look, stay by the car, would you?

01:39:07.384 --> 01:39:11.347
What are we doing here
if we're going to be turned away?

01:39:11.472 --> 01:39:14.391
What good is it?

01:39:15.476 --> 01:39:17.144
You control everything.

01:39:17.269 --> 01:39:20.189
Through your son, you've shown power

01:39:20.314 --> 01:39:24.485
to even feed thousands.

01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:28.405
You've calmed the seas
and even walked on water.

01:39:50.177 --> 01:39:52.555
Water.

01:40:00.479 --> 01:40:02.314
Thank you, God.

01:40:02.439 --> 01:40:05.568
Walk on water.

01:40:41.937 --> 01:40:43.230
Hey. Good morning.

01:40:43.355 --> 01:40:44.773
Forkpah.

01:40:46.275 --> 01:40:47.610
Selli.

01:40:47.735 --> 01:40:48.861
It's a good day to teach.

01:40:48.986 --> 01:40:50.696
Gaye.

01:40:50.821 --> 01:40:52.031
Hey. Good morning.

01:40:52.156 --> 01:40:54.366
Menti. Meyers.

01:40:54.491 --> 01:40:55.492
Nyanforth.

01:41:00.414 --> 01:41:01.415
Hey.

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.250
Wake up.

01:41:03.375 --> 01:41:05.711
Guys, let's go.

01:41:08.088 --> 01:41:10.049
What? What's happened?

01:41:10.174 --> 01:41:12.468
- Good morning.
- Is it?

01:41:12.593 --> 01:41:14.178
What did I miss?

01:41:14.303 --> 01:41:16.597
A glorious sunrise.

01:41:19.183 --> 01:41:21.935
- Good morning, Abubakar.
- Selli, good morning.

01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:23.771
- Good morning.
- Let's go.

01:41:23.896 --> 01:41:26.523
Up. Hey, come on, guys.

01:41:26.649 --> 01:41:28.359
We're going to Freetown today.

01:41:28.484 --> 01:41:29.902
What? How do you know that?

01:41:30.027 --> 01:41:36.992
Because you, my brother,
are serving an all-powerful God.

01:41:59.556 --> 01:42:02.017
The Lord provides a way.

01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:05.104
Yes, he does.

01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:08.482
At this rate, we are going
to be here for a while.

01:42:08.607 --> 01:42:09.817
Yes.

01:42:09.942 --> 01:42:11.902
Got anything to do
to pass away the time?

01:42:24.206 --> 01:42:26.542
Okay, guys.

01:43:50.459 --> 01:43:53.378
There's a bunch, probably...

01:43:53.504 --> 01:43:54.588
Abubakar.

01:43:54.713 --> 01:43:58.008
- I gave them the Book of Mormon.
- Guys! Brothers, hey. Hey!

01:43:59.218 --> 01:44:01.887
Do whatever he says. Please.

01:44:09.812 --> 01:44:12.147
Pull the car over,
and get out, all of you.

01:44:12.272 --> 01:44:13.273
Let's go.

01:44:13.398 --> 01:44:16.360
Right there. Let's go.

01:44:17.319 --> 01:44:18.904
Back off, all of you! Back off!

01:44:19.029 --> 01:44:22.407
I'll kill every last one of you for helping
this Krahn, starting with him.

01:44:22.533 --> 01:44:24.284
Move! Move back!

01:44:24.409 --> 01:44:26.578
These young men are missionaries.
They've done nothing wrong.

01:44:26.703 --> 01:44:28.205
Hey!

01:44:28.330 --> 01:44:29.498
What are you doing?

01:44:29.623 --> 01:44:32.501
Hold it right there. Hey, you.

01:44:32.626 --> 01:44:34.795
What are you doing? Huh?

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:38.090
What is your authority? Who is that?

01:44:38.215 --> 01:44:39.842
Who are you?

01:44:39.967 --> 01:44:43.136
My name is Elder John Gaye.

01:44:43.262 --> 01:44:44.555
Let him go.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.223
He is one of those people.

01:44:46.348 --> 01:44:47.599
He is a Krahn.

01:44:47.724 --> 01:44:49.685
I said let him go.

01:45:01.446 --> 01:45:03.073
Where are you from?

01:45:05.868 --> 01:45:07.911
I'm from Monrovia, sir.

01:45:08.036 --> 01:45:13.041
I left my home and my family to serve
the people of Liberia for two years.

01:45:13.166 --> 01:45:15.544
I'm a volunteer.

01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:16.879
And you are all with him?

01:45:18.964 --> 01:45:21.675
And you want to leave Liberia?

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.138
Sir, we have been unable
to teach for over six months now

01:45:26.263 --> 01:45:27.931
because of rebel fighting.

01:45:28.056 --> 01:45:31.476
We are going to Freetown
to continue teaching

01:45:31.602 --> 01:45:36.648
until conditions in Monrovia
are safe to return.

01:45:38.567 --> 01:45:40.485
And you all made it here in this thing?

01:45:40.611 --> 01:45:42.821
Yeah, on one tank of petrol.

01:45:42.946 --> 01:45:45.782
With no flats

01:45:45.908 --> 01:45:48.410
and very little damage
to the undercarriage.

01:45:48.535 --> 01:45:51.121
And you... Why do you want
to deny them passage?

01:45:51.246 --> 01:45:53.624
There is no place for any Krahn
in this country.

01:45:54.833 --> 01:45:58.420
And you? Whose side are you on?

01:45:58.545 --> 01:46:00.047
Hmm?

01:46:18.315 --> 01:46:19.608
You weak, little Krahn lover.

01:46:19.733 --> 01:46:22.486
I've sworn to protect
our great nation Liberia

01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:26.281
by eliminating all filthy Krahns,
and he is a Krahn.

01:46:26.406 --> 01:46:28.283
And so am I!

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.546
Get them on the next ferry.

01:46:41.672 --> 01:46:43.924
Wherever they need to go.

01:46:44.049 --> 01:46:45.926
Now.

01:48:51.551 --> 01:48:52.969
How did you know, Abubakar?

01:48:53.095 --> 01:48:54.179
Know what?

01:48:54.304 --> 01:48:58.308
How did you know about the ferry,
that we would make it across?

01:48:58.433 --> 01:49:01.061
He had faith... faith we would.

01:49:01.186 --> 01:49:02.354
How did you know?

01:49:02.479 --> 01:49:05.148
I didn't know. I didn't ever know.

01:49:06.316 --> 01:49:07.776
Somewhere along the way,

01:49:07.901 --> 01:49:11.446
between the mission office
and the rebel checkpoints,

01:49:11.571 --> 01:49:13.698
between running out of petrol

01:49:13.824 --> 01:49:16.326
but somehow always having enough,

01:49:16.451 --> 01:49:18.537
or children fleeing from rebels

01:49:18.662 --> 01:49:21.790
but smiling whenever they see you,

01:49:21.915 --> 01:49:25.544
between hoping for the future
but fearing what was ahead,

01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:28.505
it just doesn't make sense
to doubt anymore.

01:49:29.965 --> 01:49:32.300
Thank you, Abubakar.

01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:43.145
Selli, when we get there,
don't let Sister Cunningham see you.

01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:45.021
You're kind of a mess.

01:49:45.147 --> 01:49:47.566
If I stand next to Meyers,
I'll do just fine.

01:49:47.691 --> 01:49:50.569
Hey, what do you mean? I look fine.

01:49:54.239 --> 01:49:56.992
- This is it.
- All right.

01:49:57.117 --> 01:49:58.660
Let's go say hello.

01:49:58.785 --> 01:50:01.454
My leg hurts.

01:50:09.671 --> 01:50:11.089
Elder Menti?

01:50:11.214 --> 01:50:13.049
Elder Meyers?

01:50:13.175 --> 01:50:15.218
- Let's go say hello.
- Hey. All right.

01:50:15.343 --> 01:50:17.387
Oh. Look at you.

01:50:17.512 --> 01:50:19.014
Oh.

01:50:19.139 --> 01:50:20.432
Yeah.

01:50:20.557 --> 01:50:21.766
- President.
- Elder, how are you?

01:50:21.892 --> 01:50:23.018
I'm fine.

01:50:23.143 --> 01:50:24.519
- You made it.
- Yes.

01:50:24.644 --> 01:50:27.105
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Meyers, look at you.

01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:28.315
It's so good to see you.

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.108
There.

01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.572
Elders.

01:50:38.325 --> 01:50:40.785
Please, come in. Come in.
There's plenty of room.

01:50:40.911 --> 01:50:42.245
Is there work?

01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:44.289
- Lots of work.
- Good.

01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:47.584
Hello, president.

01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:48.919
What are you doing?

01:50:49.044 --> 01:50:52.964
Uh, I thought I should remove
the battery to keep it safe.

01:50:54.389 --> 01:50:55.909
Everything is safe.

01:50:59.095 --> 01:51:03.058
Brother Abubakar, you've done
everything I asked. Thank you.

01:51:03.183 --> 01:51:04.809
It's a pleasure.
