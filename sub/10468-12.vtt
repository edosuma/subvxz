WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:04.221
Owen: HOW COME
I CAN'T WEAR

00:04.221 --> 00:06.484
MY BASKETBALL UNIFORM
TO SCHOOL?
HUGHLEY DOES.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.964
Victor: WELL, SOMEBODY
SHOULD TELL HUGHLEY

00:07.964 --> 00:11.098
THAT IT'S JANUARY
OUTSIDE.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.838
Will: HEY, I BET
I CAN GET YOU
A NINERS JERSEY

00:12.838 --> 00:13.839
YOU COULD WEAR
TO SCHOOL.

00:13.839 --> 00:14.840
Owen: COOL.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.103
Bailey: MORNING!

00:16.103 --> 00:17.713
HEY, WHERE'D
YOU COME FROM?

00:17.713 --> 00:19.106
YOU WEREN'T
IN YOUR ROOM.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.456
I WAS, UH, OUT...

00:21.456 --> 00:23.458
GETTING
SOME EXERCISE.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.156
WAS EXERCISING.
I WENT TO THE GYM.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.679
WITHOUT ME?

00:27.679 --> 00:28.854
HOW COME BAILEY
GETS TO WEAR

00:28.854 --> 00:30.117
THE SAME CLOTHES
EVERY DAY?

00:30.117 --> 00:31.814
BUT I CAN'T?

00:31.814 --> 00:35.296
LET'S PONDER THAT
ON OUR WAY TO SCHOOL,
SHALL WE?

00:35.296 --> 00:37.037
OH, BAILEY,
DON'T FORGET MY
BASKETBALL GAME TODAY.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.909
AND YOU SAID HUGHLEY
COULD SPEND THE NIGHT
AFTER, REMEMBER?

00:39.909 --> 00:41.215
I REMEMBER.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.564
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.653
UH, VICTOR.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.872
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE TIME TO STAY
FOR THE WHOLE GAME,

00:46.872 --> 00:48.396
SO COULD YOU TAKE HIM
HOME AFTERWARDS FOR ME?

00:48.396 --> 00:51.007
YEAH, YOU GOT
ANOTHER ALL-NIGHTER
PLANNED?

00:51.007 --> 00:54.663
NO, I DON'T.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.318
I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.146
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE GAME.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.103
OK.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.068
SO, FOR THOSE
OF US KEEPING SCORE,
AND I AM,

01:08.068 --> 01:10.026
HAVE YOU SLEPT
IN YOUR OWN BED
AT ALL THIS WEEK?

01:10.026 --> 01:11.636
I'M NOT--I'M NOT JUDGING.
I'M JEALOUS.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.029
WHY?

01:13.029 --> 01:15.075
I THOUGHT YOU
AND DEBORAH
WERE, UH...

01:15.075 --> 01:16.598
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW,

01:16.598 --> 01:18.034
TAKING IT SLOW.

01:18.034 --> 01:21.298
RESPONSIBLY,
EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.952
AND NOW WITH HER
LITTLE SISTER IN TOWN,

01:22.952 --> 01:24.606
WE'LL GO EVEN SLOWER.

01:24.606 --> 01:28.784
SO...HEY, BRING HER
BY THE RESTAURANT.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.091
WE'LL HAVE DINNER,
I'LL DISTRACT
THE LITTLE SISTER,

01:31.091 --> 01:33.702
AND YOU AND DEBORAH CAN...

01:33.702 --> 01:34.746
NOW, WHEN YOU SAY LITTLE,

01:34.746 --> 01:36.008
HOW LITTLE IS LITTLE?

01:36.008 --> 01:38.359
I MEAN, FORGET IT.
OK? SHE'S 18.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.317
SHE'S FROM TULSA.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.884
AND WHAT? YOU DON'T
TRUST ME WITH HER?

01:41.884 --> 01:42.972
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.060
BASED ON
WHAT I'VE SEEN,

01:44.060 --> 01:45.061
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT, I MEAN,

01:45.061 --> 01:46.280
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED,
BAILEY?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.629
I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE
SEX PIRATE THING

01:47.629 --> 01:48.934
WASN'T HOISTING
YOUR SAIL.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.719
OH, COME ON. THAT'S--

01:50.719 --> 01:53.374
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, MAN.

01:53.374 --> 01:56.812
LISTEN, HOLLY
HAD A GOOD POINT.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.336
I'M NOT READY
TO BE SETTLING DOWN
WITH ANY ONE PERSON YET,

01:59.336 --> 02:01.643
SO THE BEST THING
FOR ME TO DO, MAYBE,

02:01.643 --> 02:04.602
IS TO GET OUT
OF THE HOUSE
AND GET OUT OF MY HEAD

02:04.602 --> 02:07.866
AND...RELAX A LITTLE BIT,

02:07.866 --> 02:10.521
PROVE TO MYSELF
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE
PERSON OUT THERE FOR ME.

02:10.521 --> 02:11.696
AND IF THAT MEANS
HAVING TO BE THERE

02:11.696 --> 02:13.350
WITH EVERY WOMAN
IN SAN FRANCISCO?

02:13.350 --> 02:15.135
THEN SO BE IT.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.529
WILL, I'M KIDDING.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.967
LOOK, HERE...

02:23.926 --> 02:25.014
CALL DEBORAH.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.146
I WILL TAKE
EXCELLENT CARE

02:26.146 --> 02:27.843
OF HER LITTLE SISTER.
I PROMISE.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.759
OK. YOU BETTER,
'CAUSE DEB AND ME,
WE ARE SO CLOSE.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.978

03:13.454 --> 03:16.892
NON-METAL JOINERY,
IMPORTED WOOD.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.938
UM, IT TAKES TIME.
A LOT OF OUR ORDERS
ARE CUSTOM--

03:19.938 --> 03:21.375
HOW MUCH TIME?

03:21.375 --> 03:24.769
WELL, THAT--THAT VARIES,
DEPENDING ON--

03:24.769 --> 03:25.988
WELL, HOW MUCH TIME?

03:25.988 --> 03:27.163
IF I HAVE TO TELL
PEOPLE 6 WEEKS,

03:27.163 --> 03:29.121
IT'S A PRETTY
TOUGH SELL.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.081
OK. IF IT'S, UH,
IF IT'S
A CATALOG ORDER,

03:32.081 --> 03:35.040

03:36.868 --> 03:38.696
I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT,
I'M SORRY.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.177
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT
THAT FAX TO SAO PAULO.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.614
UH, IT NEEDS TO GET
THERE BEFORE THE SIESTA.

03:43.614 --> 03:44.876
YOU KNOW,
JUST THE WORDING OF IT.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.617
THIS IS--IT'S
GONNA BE A SECOND.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.229
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.273
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING ME

03:50.273 --> 03:51.796
PREP FOR THE DESIGN
CONVENTION.

03:51.796 --> 03:52.971
I AM HELPING YOU.
WILL YOU JUST
LISTEN TO ME?

03:52.971 --> 03:54.799
JUST LISTEN, OK?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.366
NOW I LEARNED THIS
IN TELEMARKETING,

03:56.366 --> 03:59.717
THE FIRST RULE OF SALES
IS CLOSE THE DEAL.

03:59.717 --> 04:03.286
FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT
AND PROMISE IT TO THEM.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.853
I'M NOT GONNA--
I'M NOT GONNA
PROMISE THEM

04:04.853 --> 04:06.071
ANYTHING
I CAN'T DELIVER.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.595
YOU ARE GONNA
DELIVER IT TO THEM.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.726
YOU'RE JUST GONNA DELIVER
IT A LITTLE BIT LATE.

04:08.726 --> 04:09.771
DAPH, NO.

04:09.771 --> 04:10.815
DO YOU KNOW
ANY CONTRACTOR

04:10.815 --> 04:12.164
WHO ACTUALLY
DELIVERS ON TIME?

04:12.164 --> 04:14.166
YOUR OWN SUPPLIERS
DON'T EVEN DO THAT.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.736
YOU NEED
THESE ORDERS, CHARLIE.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.303
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOURSELF
THAT THIS BUSINESS

04:20.303 --> 04:21.348
WAS ABOUT
TO GO BELLY UP?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.958
YEAH, BUT I'M--
OK, GOOD.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.830
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:25.830 --> 04:29.312
NOW DID YOU SAY THAT
YOU NEEDED THIS ORDER
SHIPPED IN 6 WEEKS?

04:29.312 --> 04:31.183
WELL, 6
IS A LITTLE LONG--

04:31.183 --> 04:32.184
OK, GOOD.
BUT, UM--

04:32.184 --> 04:33.403
THEN WE'LL
SHIP IT IN 4.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.404
Daphne:
DO YOU NEED
A BROCHURE?

04:34.404 --> 04:36.363
Customer: YEAH.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.930
THE ELUSIVE FLOW.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.107
WHAT WE CRAVE EVERY TIME
WE SIT DOWN TO CREATE.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.762
HOW DO WE GET INTO THE FLOW?

04:44.762 --> 04:46.895
WHO KNOWS?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.462
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS EVENT.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.812
YOU CAN'T
TURN IT ON LIKE A SPIGOT.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.640
YOU JUST HAVE TO...

04:52.640 --> 04:55.817
WRITE AND WRITE AND WRITE.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.949
SO, LET'S TRY IT NOW.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.168
I WANT EVERYBODY

04:59.168 --> 05:00.691
JUST TO START WRITING--

05:00.691 --> 05:01.997
NO THINKING--

05:01.997 --> 05:03.477
ON A SUBJECT
I'LL NAME IN A MOMENT.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.217
PENS AND PENCILS READY.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.436
EXCUSE ME, UH,
WHAT'RE WE--

05:06.436 --> 05:08.220
THE SUBJECT IS SHADOW.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.484
WHAT ABOUT, UH,
WORD COUNT OR
SYNTAX? IS THERE--

05:10.484 --> 05:11.789

WHOO! GOOD GAME, GUYS.
GOOD GAME, ALL!

06:23.121 --> 06:24.601
WAS A GOOD GAME, HUH?

06:24.601 --> 06:25.994
HUGHLEY LOOKED
PRETTY GOOD OUT THERE.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.432
HE NEEDS TO WORK
ON HIS DEFENSE.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.349
UH, SO WHAT TIME
DO YOU WANT ME

06:33.349 --> 06:34.916
TO DROP HIM BACK
AT YOUR PLACE?

06:34.916 --> 06:36.874
OR DO YOU WANT
TO COME BY
AND PICK HIM UP?

06:36.874 --> 06:38.659
BAILEY'LL BE THERE
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

06:38.659 --> 06:39.921
RIGHT.
PROBABLY NOT UNTIL

06:39.921 --> 06:41.531
AFTER I PUT THEM
TO BED, BUT, YEAH--

06:41.531 --> 06:42.706
EXCUSE ME.

06:46.362 --> 06:49.800
GUYS, FELLAS, FELLAS,
HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
HOW ABOUT...

06:52.716 --> 06:55.284
HMM? DOES THAT
SOUND GOOD?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.201
CAN I SPEND
THE NIGHT AT HUGHLEY'S?

06:59.201 --> 07:00.855
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED HIM TO COME
TO YOUR HOUSE.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.944
YEAH, BUT MR. WARD
WANTS TO TAKE US
FOR A PIZZA

07:02.944 --> 07:05.642
AND MAYBE A MOVIE AFTER.COME ON, OWEN, LET'S GO!

07:05.642 --> 07:08.950
WELL, IT'S REALLY
NOT UP TO ME, KIDDO,
IT'S UP TO BAILEY.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.256
WELL, IF HE HAS A PROBLEM,
JUST TELL HIM TO GET ME
AT HUGHLEY'S.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.562
OK?

07:12.562 --> 07:14.608
OK.

07:14.608 --> 07:15.696
Stan: LET'S GO, GUYS.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.786
EXCUSE ME.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.441
UH, EXCUSE ME,
CAN I--CAN I ASK
YOU A QUESTION?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.399
W-WHY DIDN'T YOU
TURN IN YOUR PIECE
BACK THERE?

07:23.399 --> 07:25.009
WHAT?WELL, I--I SAW YOU.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.403
EVERYONE ELSE PUT
THEIRS IN THE PILE
EXCEPT YOU.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.754
FOR A GOOD REASON.
IT STINKS.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.104
GREAT. 'CAUSE, UM,
OOPS, SORRY.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.063
'CAUSE REALLY GOOD WRITING,
THAT-THAT'S SOMETHING

07:35.063 --> 07:36.760
YOU HAVE
TO SWEAT OVER, RIGHT?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.283
GUESS SO.
CAN I--

07:38.283 --> 07:39.633
CAN I JUST, UM, HANG ON--

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
NO, I'M NOT REALLY--

07:42.897 --> 07:44.725
WAIT, THIS IS...

07:44.725 --> 07:47.423
GOOD. THIS IS FUNNY.
YOUR GRAMMAR'S
NOT PERFECT, BUT--

07:47.423 --> 07:48.642
OH, NO.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.730
WHY DIDN'T YOU
HAND THIS IN?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.167
I DON'T KNOW.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.212
I--I THOUGHT I COULD
MAKE IT BETTER.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.652
YEAH. WELL,
NONE OF MY WRITING
IS GOOD, EITHER.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.392
MY ANSWER IS DON'T
WRITE ANYTHING.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.178
YOU--YOU WRITE
2 SOLID PAGES, AND
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.962
AH, THANKS, BUT I'M--

08:04.962 --> 08:06.529
LOOK, I'M SORRY
TO DUMP THIS ON YOU,

08:06.529 --> 08:08.618
BUT I JUST POURED
MY ENTIRE LIFE
INTO A BOOK,

08:08.618 --> 08:10.185
AND NOW IT'S, LIKE,
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.447
AND FRIDAY I HAVE
AN ASSIGNMENT DUE.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.927
I'M SUPPOSED TO
CREATE A CHARACTER,

08:12.927 --> 08:14.972
BUT I CAN'T
COME UP WITH--
WITH ANYTHING.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.626
AND I LOOK AT YOU,
AND IT SEEMS
SO EASY.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.020
SO I'M
JUST WONDERING,
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

08:21.370 --> 08:23.938
UH, OK, WELL, UH...

08:23.938 --> 08:25.374
ONE THING IS COFFEE.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.593
TONS OF IT.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.811
MAKES MY HAND
MOVE FASTER,

08:27.811 --> 08:29.465
AND THAT MAKES
MY HEAD MOVE FASTER.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.467
ALSO PLENTY
OF FRIED FOODS.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.642
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
THAT LUBRICATES THE BRAIN--

08:32.642 --> 08:34.426
YOU'RE MAKING
FUN OF ME.
NO.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.298
OK, FAT.
WHY NOT? COFFEE.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.518
AND I ALSO LIKE TO KEEP
MYSELF IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF YEARNING.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.954
YEARNING.
YEARNING FOR WHAT?

08:39.954 --> 08:41.521
YOU KNOW,
THE USUAL STUFF.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.088
UH, RESPECT,
MATERIAL OBJECTS.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.394
UH-HUH.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.743
SEX.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.485
I'VE TRIED
ALL OF THAT.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.226
IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:51.226 --> 08:53.533
UH, NO. MM-MMM.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.713
WHO'S "LANE VICTORY"?

09:01.845 --> 09:04.239
SO, UH, LISTEN.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.328
UH, HEY!
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:06.328 --> 09:07.895
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR--

09:13.509 --> 09:14.597
THANK YOU.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.212
I'M SORRY.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.736

09:22.736 --> 09:25.347
CLAUDIA SALINGER?

09:25.347 --> 09:26.957

IN THE SEVENTIES.T

13:09.440 --> 13:12.574

FOR A HIP-HOP HACK.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.700
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU SEEMED LIKE
YOU WERE HAVING FUN.

WELL, WE WERE.

THAT I PLAY WITH

14:19.119 --> 14:21.295
AND THE PEOPLE
WHO BOOK OUR SESSIONS,

14:21.295 --> 14:22.600
WHO YOU SHOULD MEET.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.951
IT DOESN'T REALLY
HAVE TO BE A DATE.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.083

JUST MEET THERE, OR--

AND IT WAS DROPPED OVERBOARD
BY THE CREW OF THIS SHIP.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.713
SO IT'S THE FIRST
AND LAST TIME

14:48.713 --> 14:50.063
THAT AN ENEMY SUB WAS SUNK

14:50.063 --> 14:52.630

MOLD MY SUBJECT AROUND YOU.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.211
WHAT?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.126
WELL, I JUST
THOUGHT IF I...

15:53.126 --> 15:54.301
WROTE ABOUT SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT BLOCKED,

15:54.301 --> 15:56.259
THEN THAT
MIGHT HELP ME.

15:56.259 --> 15:59.436
DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CREATEA CHARACTER?

15:59.436 --> 16:02.091

16:02.091 --> 16:04.180
YOU WEREN'T
IN THE FACE BOOK.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.574

16:06.574 --> 16:09.142
ABOUT HOW YOU DIDN'T WANNA
HAND IN YOUR ASSIGNMENT

16:09.142 --> 16:10.317
OR TELL ME YOUR NAME.

SOMETHING TO OWEN,

17:17.427 --> 17:19.690

19:01.792 --> 19:04.186
BYE.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.840
Claudia:
OK. THAT WAS SCARY.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.624
I HAD NO IDEA
IT WOULD BE
AN AUDITION.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.714
IT WASN'T AN AUDITION.
IT WAS JUST A JAM SESSION.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.238
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.630
HMM, MY PITCH WAS OFF.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.806
YOU HAVE
PERFECT PITCH.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.157
IN FACT, JOANNE'S
GONNA CALL YOU
ABOUT A FILM SCORE

19:18.157 --> 19:19.549
THAT WE'RE DOING
THIS WEEK.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.248
SHE IS?
WAIT, THIS WEEK?

19:22.248 --> 19:24.989
THIS--THIS WEEK
I--I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO PRACTICE.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.905
AND PRACTICE, AND--YOU CAN'T.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.080
I MEAN,
THAT'S THE THING.
NONE OF US

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
EVER KNOWS WHAT
THE MUSIC WILL BE

19:30.560 --> 19:31.953
TILL WE GET THERE.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.520
MAN, THAT--THAT
IS HORRIFYING.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.086
TOTALLY.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.871
AT FIRST, BUT
THEN IT'S KINDA
LIBERATING, TOO.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.308
I MEAN...YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
MISTAKES

19:39.308 --> 19:40.701
AND IT'LL
NEVER BE PERFECT,

19:40.701 --> 19:42.877
BUT THEN YOU
LEARN TO LISTEN
TO YOURSELF

19:42.877 --> 19:44.052
TO HEAR
HOW YOU BLEND

19:44.052 --> 19:45.880
WITH THE OTHER
INSTRUMENTS.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.187
YOU LEARN
HOW TO TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.321
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DO THAT.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.628
YOU CAN.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.979

20:07.728 --> 20:09.251
I-I'M SORRY.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.821
CLAUDIA, WAIT.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.344
I'M SORRY, TODD.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.477
I CAN'T.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.832
SO, 4 YEARS
AND NOT A WORD?

20:24.832 --> 20:26.573
NO. SHE SENDS
POSTCARDS.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.792

IN THE OUTBACK
STUDYING ABORIGINES.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.012
THAT--THAT
KIND OF THING.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.448
BUT SHE DOESN'T
SEND ANY MONEY.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.669
NO. WHEN MY DAD
DIED, ALL HE HAD
WAS DEBT.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.628
SO...

20:38.628 --> 20:41.065
YOU KNOW, I-IT'S
SAD, BUT IT'S TRUE.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.067
I'M JUST--

20:43.067 --> 20:44.852
I MEAN, ADAM, NOT ONLY
ARE YOU CONSTANTLY

20:44.852 --> 20:46.593
ON THE VERGE
OF GETTING CAUGHT,

20:46.593 --> 20:49.987
BUT YOU ALSO--I MEAN,
YOU CAN'T GET GRADES
OR CREDIT

20:49.987 --> 20:52.686
OR FEEDBACK LIKE
ANY OF THE REST OF US CAN.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.818
NOW THE THING IS,
YOU PROBABLY COULD.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.516
I MEAN, YOU'D GET
FINANCIAL AID.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.691
FORGET IT, I CAN'T.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.040
I MEAN,
THEY SEE ME AROUND.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.911
IF I GO TO THE DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS,

21:00.911 --> 21:02.043
HE WILL
RECOGNIZE ME.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.001
ADAM--
NO.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.176
LOOK, I DON'T
WANT TO RISK IT.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.135
WHY NOT?

21:07.135 --> 21:08.092
THANK YOU.

21:11.966 --> 21:15.143
YOU KNOW
HOW I FOUND OUT
I LIKE TO WRITE?

21:15.143 --> 21:18.712
IT WAS, UM, IN
THE HOSPITAL WHEN
MY DAD HAD DIED.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.801
AND MY MOM WAS
SUCH A BASKET CASE,

21:20.801 --> 21:23.194
SO SHE ASKED ME
TO WRITE THE OBIT.

21:23.194 --> 21:26.154
SO I JUST--
I JUST MADE UP

21:26.154 --> 21:28.678
THIS WHOLE
SECOND CAREER
FOR HIM.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.724
AND THEN PEOPLE
KEPT COMING UP TO ME
AT THE FUNERAL

21:30.724 --> 21:33.117
SAYING, "YOU KNOW,
HAL NEVER TOLD ME

21:33.117 --> 21:34.684
"HE KNEW
HOW TO YODEL.

21:34.684 --> 21:37.992
AND HE TOURED
SWITZERLAND?
REALLY?"

21:37.992 --> 21:39.472
[LAUGHS]

21:40.734 --> 21:42.126
AND EVER SINCE THEN,

21:42.126 --> 21:44.520

THE WRITING IS...

21:48.219 --> 21:51.440

I WANT TO KEEP
GOING THERE, JULIA.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.877

THE PROFESSORS,

21:53.877 --> 21:56.402

THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW
HOW IT'S DONE.

21:58.142 --> 22:01.015

TO LOSE THAT.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.977

YOU'D BE HERE
AN HOUR AGO.

ANY CHANCE WITH

MEGAN?

LAST NIGHT.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.131
W-WILL!

22:30.131 --> 22:32.612
DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS A VIRGIN,
BAILEY?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.135
UNTIL LAST NIGHT,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

22:34.135 --> 22:36.050
WHAT?!

22:36.050 --> 22:39.532
NO WAY. W-WA--WAIT.

22:39.532 --> 22:43.231
[SIGHS]
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT, WILL?

22:43.231 --> 22:45.233
I MEAN, THIS GIRL
WAS PRACTICALLY
BEGGING ME--

22:45.233 --> 22:46.669
JUST SHUT UP, OK?

22:46.669 --> 22:48.410
MEGAN IS WRECKED
RIGHT NOW

22:48.410 --> 22:50.107
BECAUSE THE JERK
THAT SHE WAS STUPID
ENOUGH TO SLEEP WITH

22:50.107 --> 22:51.631

IN HER LIFE

THE DECENCY
TO CALL HER.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.462

YOU'RE SORRY NOW!

22:58.812 --> 23:04.034

TO THIS GIRL
LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.949

WITH SOMEBODY.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.084
I ASKED YOU NOT TO.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.390
YOU PROMISED ME
YOU WOULDN'T.

HAVE TO GO

29:14.883 --> 29:16.580
GOD, HOW WAS IT?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.365
IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

29:18.365 --> 29:22.717
CHARLIE HERE
IS A BIG HOO-HA NOW.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.636
[SIGHS]
I KEPT TRYING
TO GET AWAY,

29:28.636 --> 29:31.117
BUT MILLER GOT ME
INTO THIS QUESTION
AND ANSWER SESSION--

29:31.117 --> 29:33.641
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

29:33.641 --> 29:36.426
I AM THE PROJECT
LEADER, CHARLIE.

29:36.426 --> 29:39.255
YEAH, YEAH.
THEY CAN'T DO
ANYTHING WITHOUT YOU.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.301
THIS STUDY IS JUST
REALLY IMPORTANT--

29:41.301 --> 29:43.651
I HEARD ALL ABOUT
THE STUDY LAST NIGHT,
KIRSTEN, REMEMBER?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.261
I WAS--I WAS
AT YOUR THING.

29:45.261 --> 29:48.264
YEAH, YOU WERE.

29:48.264 --> 29:49.526
COURSE YOU WERE
TAKING CALLS

29:49.526 --> 29:50.919
ON THE CELL PHONE
ALL NIGHT.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.792
WELL, I GUESS I REALLY
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE,

29:53.792 --> 29:56.664
BUT I KNEW HOW IMPORTANT
THAT PARTY WAS TO YOU,

29:56.664 --> 29:58.318
SO I FOUND
A WAY TO DO BOTH.

29:59.710 --> 30:03.627
LOOK, IT'S JUST--

30:03.627 --> 30:06.587
TODAY WENT
INCREDIBLY WELL.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.284
AND I WANTED TO
SHARE THAT WITH YOU.

30:08.284 --> 30:14.073
I MEAN, TO BE WITH YOU
AT ALL LATELY
WOULD BE GREAT.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.597
I'M BUSY, CHARLIE,
LIKE YOU ARE.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.425
WHAT CAN I DO
ABOUT THAT?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.774
TRY HARDER.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.732
I MEAN, SOMETHING'S
GOTTA GIVE HERE.

30:21.732 --> 30:24.910
SOMEONE'S GOTTA
MAKE A CONCESSION.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.694
WHICH ONE OF US
SHOULD THAT BE?

30:26.694 --> 30:28.783
ARE YOU
VOLUNTEERING?

30:36.138 --> 30:37.748
EXCUSE ME,
WHO'S AARON?

30:37.748 --> 30:39.707
WHAT?AARON. AARON MARTIN.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.752
YOU KNOW,
YOUR CHARACTER STUDY.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.798
WHAT, YOU COULDN'T
HAVE EVEN, LIKE,
CHANGED HIS INITIALS?

30:43.798 --> 30:47.846
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CREATE SOMETHING,
JULIA, CREATE.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.370
BUT THIS--
THIS IS TOTALLY ME.
IT IS MY LIFE.

30:50.370 --> 30:53.199
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.
I CHANGED ALL KINDS
OF STUFF.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.591
BOTH HIS PARENTS
ARE DEAD,

30:54.591 --> 30:55.854
WHICH IS ARGUABLY ME
MORE THAN YOU.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.072
AND HE LIVES
IN DES MOINES.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.031
YOU WROTE THAT
HE IS GOING TO SCHOOL

30:59.031 --> 31:00.902
WITHOUT PAYING TUITION.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.165
OK, OK, SO I USED
SOME OF THAT STUFF.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.732
BUT IT'S JUST
AN ASSIGNMENT.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.038
ONE PROFESSOR'S
GONNA SEE IT,
THAT'S IT.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.082
I'M NOT
PUBLISHING IT.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.083
ONE PROFESSOR.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.824
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

31:09.824 --> 31:12.609
ONE PROFESSOR
IS ALL IT TAKES.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.307
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:14.307 --> 31:16.091
ONE PROFESSOR
WHO HAS HALF A BRAIN

31:16.091 --> 31:18.441
THAT HE HAPPENED TO NOTICE
THE 900 SIMILARITIES

31:18.441 --> 31:21.140
BETWEEN AARON AND ME.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.229
ADAM, WHAT HAPPENED?

31:25.057 --> 31:26.710
HE CHECKED UP ON ME.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.408
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.323
FOUND OUT THERE'S
NO STUDENT ENROLLED
IN MY NAME.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.630
SO HE CALLED
PRESIDENT ERWICH,
AND I AM DONE.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.937
BANNED FROM CAMPUS.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.418
OH, GOD, ADAM.
I NEVER PLANNED--

31:38.418 --> 31:40.072
AND YOU SAID
YOU WERE BLOCKED.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.989
MAN, I GUESS
I HAD NO IDEA YOU
WERE THIS FAR GONE.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.784
OH, VICTOR,
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR STAYING LATE.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.874
HAD A COMPUTER
MELTDOWN. I THOUGHT
JOE WAS ON IT,

31:59.874 --> 32:02.572
HE THOUGHT
I WAS ON IT, SO...

32:03.878 --> 32:06.054
SO...

32:06.054 --> 32:08.796
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE TO TALK
TO OWEN ABOUT--

32:08.796 --> 32:11.016
UH, NO.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.888
NOT YET.
BUT I WILL.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.846
I HOPE SO.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.807
'CAUSE OWEN WAS AFRAID
I WAS TRYING TO TURN HIM
INTO A FAGGOT.

32:19.807 --> 32:20.939
WHAT?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.114
HIS WORDS, NOT MINE.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.419
ACTUALLY,
HUGHLEY'S WORDS.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.943
AND I CAN
ONLY IMAGINE
WHERE HE GOT IT.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.815
[SIGHS]
VICTOR, I'M SORRY.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.295
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.514
HE JUST KNEW THAT
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE ONE.

32:31.514 --> 32:32.907
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

32:32.907 --> 32:34.735
I TOLD HIM
THE TRUTH.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.171
I HAD TO.

32:36.171 --> 32:40.132
AND HE SEEMS TO BE
OK WITH IT NOW,
BUT--

32:40.132 --> 32:42.134
WHAT?

32:42.134 --> 32:44.875
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
WITH HIM.

32:44.875 --> 32:49.271
I KNOW. I JUST--
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM,

32:49.271 --> 32:50.881
SO I THOUGHT IF I JUST
GOT HIM OUT OF THERE--

32:50.881 --> 32:52.971
I'M NOT HIS PARENT,
BAILEY.

32:54.189 --> 32:58.019
HE NEEDED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

32:58.019 --> 33:01.370
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU HAVE A LOT ON
YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW.

33:01.370 --> 33:04.069
BUT THE THING IS,
IF MY BEING HERE
WITH OWEN

33:04.069 --> 33:05.896
IS MAKING IT EASIER
FOR YOU NOT TO BE,

33:05.896 --> 33:09.596
THEN I DON'T KNOW--
I--I MEAN--

33:09.596 --> 33:12.033
I WONDER IF I SHOULD
EVEN BE HERE.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.208
I WONDER
IF I SHOULD LEAVE.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.818
VICTOR, WAIT.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.429
LOOK, LOOK.

33:18.213 --> 33:22.348
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
OK? I CARE ABOUT
OWEN A LOT.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.742
AND I KNOW THAT
HE CARES ABOUT ME.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.006
BUT YOU'RE
THE ONE HE NEEDS.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.111
ADAM, WAIT.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.329
YOU KNOW, IF THIS IS
"I'M SORRY,"

33:47.329 --> 33:48.678
THEN IT'S TOO LATE.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.419
IT'S NOT. IT'S
BETTER THAN THAT.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.421
IT'S--YOU MIGHT BE
ABLE TO STAY HERE.

33:52.421 --> 33:53.770
NOT ACCORDING
TO PRESIDENT
WOODSHED,

33:53.770 --> 33:56.425
WHOSE SHOES
I'M DIGESTING.
BACKWARDS.

33:56.425 --> 34:00.821
NO, ACCORDING TO SOMEONE
WHO I KNOW ON THE BOARD.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.737
HE READ YOUR STUFF,
THINKS YOU'RE GREAT,

34:03.737 --> 34:05.086
SAID IF YOU JUST APPLY,

34:05.086 --> 34:07.045
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND A PLACE FOR YOU.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.742
WELL, HOW?

34:08.742 --> 34:10.091
HOW? FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION FORM,

34:10.091 --> 34:11.397
CHECK THE BOX
THAT SAYS FINANCIAL AID,

34:11.397 --> 34:12.702
WRITE SOME ESSAYS--

34:12.702 --> 34:13.921
WHICH THEY'LL BE
ALL OVER.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.792
I MEAN, YOU'VE
SEEN HOW I SPELL.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.751
WELL, I'LL PROOF IT
FOR YOU. YOU WON'T
HAVE A PROBLEM.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.448
YOU GET YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
TO SEND IN YOUR TRANSCRIPT,

34:19.448 --> 34:20.928
AND THAT'S IT.
IT'S DONE.

34:20.928 --> 34:21.972
YOU KNOW WHAT?
J-J-JUST FORGET IT.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.322
ADAM,
WHY CAN'T YOU--

34:23.322 --> 34:25.324
'CAUSE I NEVER
FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.109
OK?

34:28.109 --> 34:32.853
MY MOM WAS GONE,
AND I NEEDED TO WORK.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.856
I MEAN, COME ON,
WHY DO YOU THINK
MY GRAMMAR IS SO LAME?

34:35.856 --> 34:39.468
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CAN'T SPELL?

34:39.468 --> 34:40.948
ADAM, YOU CAN
STILL GET THROUGH
THAT STUFF--

34:40.948 --> 34:41.949
YOU CAN STILL
GET A PLACE.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.864
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JULIA, PLEASE.

34:43.864 --> 34:48.825
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE,
ALL RIGHT?

34:57.225 --> 34:58.748
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

35:01.229 --> 35:03.231
GETTING READY
TO PRACTICE WITH YOU.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.972
I THOUGHT VICTOR
WAS GONNA PRACTICE
WITH ME.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.234
VICTOR'S
NOT COMING TODAY.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.409
TODAY'S YOUR DAY
WITH ME.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.933
COOL.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.935
BUT LISTEN,
BEFORE WE START,

35:11.935 --> 35:13.372
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SAY, OK?

35:14.808 --> 35:17.767
UM, FIRST OF ALL,

35:17.767 --> 35:22.642
I'M SORRY THAT
I'VE BEEN KINDA AWOL
THIS PAST LITTLE BIT.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.166
BECAUSE THE THING IS...

35:25.166 --> 35:30.650
[SIGHS] THERE'S BEEN
SOME STUFF GOING ON
SINCE SARAH LEFT

35:30.650 --> 35:36.612
THAT'S JUST BEEN
KIND OF DISTRACTING TO ME.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.788
STUFF? WHAT STUFF?

35:38.788 --> 35:42.009
UM, NOTHING. NOTHING.

35:42.009 --> 35:49.016
I'M JUST--I JUST--
I'M SAYING THAT
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

35:49.016 --> 35:51.671
ONE THING
WILL NEVER CHANGE.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.543
AND THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT
YOU ARE TO ME.

35:54.543 --> 35:59.940
OK? I CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

35:59.940 --> 36:04.771
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
AND THAT WILL
NEVER, EVER CHANGE.

36:04.771 --> 36:05.728
OK?

36:07.339 --> 36:08.601
YOU READY TO PLAY?

36:10.646 --> 36:11.821
[SOFTLY] READY.

36:19.568 --> 36:20.830
HEY.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.310
HEY.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.225
LOOK,
THANKS FOR COMING.

36:24.225 --> 36:27.054
I JUST--I HAD
TO SAY A FEW THINGS.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.273
YEAH, ME, TOO.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.492
Both: ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.102
I CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.061
I MEAN, I MIGHT
HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO FOOL YOU

36:34.061 --> 36:35.410
FOR A LITTLE
WHILE LONGER,

36:35.410 --> 36:36.890
BUT SOONER OR
LATER, I'D LAUGH

36:36.890 --> 36:38.718
AND SPIT MILK
THROUGH MY NOSE

36:38.718 --> 36:41.895
OR SPACE MY CONTACTS
AND TRIP OVER
SOMETHING.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.549
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

36:43.549 --> 36:46.508
MY SISTER
DRESSES ME.

36:46.508 --> 36:47.901
WHAT?

36:47.901 --> 36:51.861
THE CLOTHES,
THE HAIR,
THE CLIP-ON--

36:51.861 --> 36:53.472
IT'S ALL MY
LITTLE SISTER LISA.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.692
SHE SAYS HI,
BY THE WAY.

36:56.692 --> 36:59.695
I'M STILL JUST
THE SAME GEEK
FROM SEVENTH GRADE.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.480
I DON'T WANT TO BE,
BUT I AM,

37:01.480 --> 37:04.570
AND BETWEEN WORK
AND SCHOOL AND
EXTRACURRICS,

37:04.570 --> 37:06.441
I'VE PRETTY MUCH
NEVER HAD TIME
FOR A GIRLFRIEND.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.182
PRETTY MUCH EVER.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.403
AND I'M SURE YOU
COULD TELL BY THAT
ULTRA-LAME KISS.

37:11.403 --> 37:12.665
NO, NO--

37:12.665 --> 37:14.710
IT'S JUST
WHEN I SAW YOU,

37:14.710 --> 37:18.366
I THOUGHT, MAN,
YOU FINALLY HAVE

37:18.366 --> 37:19.759
A SECOND CHANCE
WITH HER.

37:19.759 --> 37:23.153
JUST DON'T BLOW IT
BY BEING YOURSELF.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.766
ANYWAY, THAT'S ALL.

37:26.766 --> 37:31.074
WHATEVER YOU CAME
TO SAY, I'M SORRY.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.598
TODD...

37:34.034 --> 37:37.777
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK...

37:39.735 --> 37:43.957
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
STILL GET ME INTO
THAT FILM SCORING GIG?

37:43.957 --> 37:45.785
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
US BAND GEEKS,

37:45.785 --> 37:48.266
WE HAVE TO STICK
TOGETHER.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.101
OK, EVERYONE?

37:58.101 --> 38:01.627
YOU WANT
TO TAKE PICTURES,

38:01.627 --> 38:06.327
THE BEST LIGHT
YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL DAY
IS RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.850
SO, UH, GO AHEAD.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.983
OK, GO.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.202
OK, LOOK,
I HAVE BEEN THINKING,

38:12.202 --> 38:14.422
AND YOU ARE NOT
BEING FAIR TO YOURSELF.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.250
THE WHOLE HIGH SCHOOL
DIPLOMA THING--

38:16.250 --> 38:17.686
MY SISTER CHECKED OUT
THE G.E.D.--

38:17.686 --> 38:19.166
IT IS NOT
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.907
AND THE STUFF
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW,

38:20.907 --> 38:22.604
YOUR GRAMMAR
AND YOUR SPELLING,
I'LL HELP YOU WITH THAT.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.302
NO, NO, THANKS.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.043
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE
REALLY DONE PLENTY
FOR ME ALREADY.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.742
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF?

38:29.742 --> 38:32.135
HO HO,
HERE IT COMES.
FREE THERAPY.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.528
NO, LISTEN TO ME.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.182
YOU MADE ME PROMISE
TO KEEP YOUR SECRETS

38:35.182 --> 38:36.792
SO YOU COULD KEEP
GOING TO CLASSES,
RIGHT?

38:36.792 --> 38:38.664
AND THEN, WHAT?
THE SECOND YOU FIND OUT

38:38.664 --> 38:40.709
YOUR WORK IS
GONNA BE JUDGED LIKE
ALL THE REST OF US--

38:40.709 --> 38:42.581
OK, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.931
SO I AM AFRAID?
NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU?

38:44.931 --> 38:47.325
I MEAN THAT IS
WHY WE'RE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.457
YOU WERE AFRAID
TO TRY ANYTHING NEW,

38:49.457 --> 38:50.763
SO YOU WROTE
ABOUT ME.

38:50.763 --> 38:51.894
FACE IT, JULIA--

38:51.894 --> 38:54.288
NO, YOU FACE IT, ADAM.

38:56.812 --> 39:00.555
OK. OK, FINE.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.602
OK, YOU'LL APPLY
FOR SCHOOL?

39:03.602 --> 39:05.821
MAYBE.
GOOD.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.781
BUT NOT UNLESS
YOU DEAL WITH
YOUR STUFF, TOO.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.217
ADAM, THIS
ISN'T ABOUT ME.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.611
OK, FINE. WE'RE
DONE, THEN.

39:12.611 --> 39:13.960
WAIT. OK, OK.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.179
WHATEVER.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.224
YOU THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO DEAL WITH,

39:17.224 --> 39:18.747
I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.183
OK.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.489
GOOD.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.013
WHAT?
GET UP THERE.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.928
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA--NO, IT'LL BE FUN.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.627
IT'LL BE GREAT.
WHAT?

39:28.627 --> 39:30.411
EVERYONE!
NO, NO.

39:30.411 --> 39:34.241
I'D LIKE YOU TO
MEET A COLLEAGUE
OF MINE.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.852
JULIA IS HERE
FROM SEATTLE,

39:36.852 --> 39:39.420
WHERE THEY JUST, UM,
DECOMMISSIONED A FRIGATE

39:39.420 --> 39:42.336
THAT I'M SURE YOU'D
ALL LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.729
JULIA?WHAT?

39:43.729 --> 39:45.252
TELL THEM ABOUT
YOUR FRIGATE.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.384
WHAT FRIGATE?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.515
YOU KNOW, THE, UH,
WHAT IS IT--

39:47.515 --> 39:49.517
THE S.S. SPONTANEOUS.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.693
NO, I DON'T.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.782
ADAM, I'M NOT--NO, GO AHEAD.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.658
OK, WELL, UM...

39:59.658 --> 40:03.313
THEY CALLED HER
THE S.S. "S"

40:03.313 --> 40:05.925
BECAUSE DURING
THE GREAT WAR,

40:05.925 --> 40:09.711
SHE MADE THE GERMAN
SS SHUDDER.

40:09.711 --> 40:13.019
AND--AND ANOTHER
INTERESTING FACT,

40:13.019 --> 40:16.718
ACTUALLY, UM,
THE WORD FRIG DIDN'T
START WHERE YOU THINK.

40:16.718 --> 40:20.548
IT STARTED WHEN
THE SAILORS WHO
WERE SCARED,

40:20.548 --> 40:22.071
'CAUSE THEY SAW ONE
COMING OVER THE HORIZON,

40:22.071 --> 40:24.552
THEY WOULD YELL,
"FRIG IT, WE'RE DEAD!"

40:29.165 --> 40:33.605
WHICH REMINDS ME OF
THE BLOODIEST BATTLE
ACTION IT EVER HAD.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.794
HEY, YOU.
HEY.

40:48.794 --> 40:52.711
LISTEN, UM,
WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT,

40:52.711 --> 40:55.278
AND, UH, WE NEED TO.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.932
UM, DOES IT
HAVE TO BE NOW,
'CAUSE I'M--

40:56.932 --> 40:59.369
NO. NOW, KIRSTEN.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.461
OK.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.897
THIS IS WORRYING ME.

41:04.897 --> 41:08.640
I MEAN, WE GOTTA FIND
A WAY TO, YOU KNOW...

41:08.640 --> 41:09.728
STAY CONNECTED.

41:09.728 --> 41:12.818
OK. HOW?

41:12.818 --> 41:16.169
MAYBE DINNER TOGETHER
A FIXED COUPLE
OF NIGHTS EVERY WEEK.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.910
OR GO TO NAPA AGAIN.

41:17.910 --> 41:19.738

BED AND BREAKFAST

41:19.738 --> 41:21.000
WE STAYED IN
THAT ONE TIME?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.958
WHICH ONE?

41:22.958 --> 41:26.614
YOU REMEMBER,
THAT PLACE WHERE
YOU WORE THE, UH,

41:26.614 --> 41:29.008
THE LITTLE RED
SATIN THING?

41:29.008 --> 41:31.532
THE THING
YOU RIPPED OFF ME
WITH YOUR TEETH?

41:31.532 --> 41:34.796
[LAUGHS] DID I DO THAT?

41:34.796 --> 41:37.886
I THOUGHT I WAS IN
HIGH SCHOOL AGAIN.
ALL THAT GROPING.

41:37.886 --> 41:41.716
FIRST OF ALL,
THE ZIPPER WAS BROKEN.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.675
AND SECOND OF ALL,
THAT WAS NOT GROPING.

41:43.675 --> 41:46.939
THAT WAS...
THAT WAS CARESSING.

41:46.939 --> 41:52.118
CARESSING.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
THAT WORD.

41:52.118 --> 41:55.817
CAN YOU--CAN YOU
SAY IT AGAIN?

41:55.817 --> 42:00.256
BUT WAIT, START, UM...

42:00.256 --> 42:01.649
START FROM
THE BEGINNING

42:01.649 --> 42:03.521
AND REMIND ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.784
WELL, UH...

42:05.784 --> 42:09.831
THERE WAS A ROMANTIC
WALK BACK HOME.

42:09.831 --> 42:12.921
YOU WERE COLD AND PUT
YOUR HAND IN MY POCKET,
REMEMBER?

42:12.921 --> 42:14.923
UH-HUH.

42:14.923 --> 42:16.185
[WHISPERING]
Keep going.

42:16.185 --> 42:18.753
AND WE WEREN'T EVEN
THROUGH THE DOOR

42:18.753 --> 42:21.364
WHEN YOU STARTED
WITH THAT WHOLE
EAR THING.

42:21.364 --> 42:23.366
WITH MY TEETH? UH-HUH.

42:23.366 --> 42:25.934
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE GOT THE FRONT
DOOR CLOSED,

42:25.934 --> 42:28.415
BUT I DON'T
REALLY REMEMBER.
