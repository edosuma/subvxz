WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.310
So, uh, welcome back, Carol.

00:06.354 --> 00:09.096
We are all so thrilled to see
how well you're doing.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.271
- Thanks.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.186
I am so ready
for a fresh start.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.491
- Me too. Me too.

00:13.535 --> 00:16.277
But just asking,

00:16.320 --> 00:18.627
corporate knows what she did
at my wedding?

00:18.670 --> 00:21.673
- Yep, they offered her
a store transfer,

00:21.717 --> 00:24.372
but lucky for us,
she declined.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.156
- Like I'm gonna leave
this store.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.637
You guys are like family to me.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.552
- Yeah, so--sweet.

00:30.595 --> 00:34.121
Um, Carol, before we can
get you out on the floor again,

00:34.164 --> 00:36.906
I've just been asked
to get a quick apology.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.299
- Okay, great.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.829
- Oh, you think I
should apologize?

00:46.872 --> 00:49.701
- Well, I mean, you almost
made me kill your cat.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.312
- I did that?

00:51.355 --> 00:53.227
- You stole Jerry from me.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.967
You rubbed your wedding
in my face for months.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.795
And then you asked me to be
your Maid of Honor.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.146
I mean, that was just cruel.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.017
- You told me I had to.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.584
- I don't know, Amy.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.108
It seems like she's not ready
to take responsibility.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.893
- You know, Carol,
some people might think,

01:07.937 --> 01:09.286
actually, that, um

01:09.330 --> 01:11.810
you are the one
who should apologize.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.204
- Oh. Oh, I see.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.076
Um, the thing is,

01:16.119 --> 01:18.252
when I spoke
with C.J. DiBono at H.R.,

01:18.295 --> 01:20.558
he said that my manager
should be impartial.

01:20.602 --> 01:24.258
- And C.J. DiBono would know.
I mean, he's...

01:24.301 --> 01:25.737
he's C.J. DiBono.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.348
- He said I should call
if there were any hiccups or...

01:27.391 --> 01:28.914
- Yeah. No, no, I don't--

01:28.958 --> 01:31.003
I don't think we need
to call C.J. DiBono.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.223
We can handle this internally.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.573
I just need a--
a quick apology.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.546
- Sorry.
- I heard an apology.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.287
Great.
Let's get back to work.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.294
- Sandra apologized to Carol?

02:00.337 --> 02:01.599
- I know.
It's crazy.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.819
She has some sort of, like,
dark power.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.342
I almost apologized to her.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.779
Anyway, how's it going?
Have you raised the wage yet?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.564
- Well, I just got here,

02:09.607 --> 02:11.653
but it seems like
a pretty good turnout.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.785
- I can still go to other
Gateway Subs, right?

02:13.829 --> 02:14.873
Just not that one?

02:14.917 --> 02:17.093
- Amy,
they exploit their workers.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.877
- But they cure
their own salami.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.531
- Amy, what the hell?

02:20.575 --> 02:22.229
Carol's back?
- I gotta go.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.926
Dina's reacting. Yes.

02:23.969 --> 02:24.970
I sent around a memo saying

02:25.014 --> 02:26.363
that she'd be back
to work today.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.278
- I thought that was a joke.
- How is that a joke?

02:28.322 --> 02:29.410
- I don't know.
You're not great at jokes.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.802
It's hard to tell sometimes.

02:30.846 --> 02:33.022
- Yeah, you've dropped
some real stinkers lately.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.197
Remember you said that joke

02:34.241 --> 02:36.199
about how Bill Cosby
was framed?

02:36.243 --> 02:39.028
- Uh, no,
that definitely wasn't me.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.856
- Oh.
- And this isn't a joke.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.118
She finished her therapy,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.685
and she got cleared
to come back to work.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.165
- So after everything
she's done,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.471
she can just waltz back in here
and wear the blue vest?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.473
The only vest
she should be wearing

02:49.517 --> 02:52.172
is one with
black and white stripes.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.651
- Like a referee?

02:53.695 --> 02:56.872
- No, like a jail vest,
like a...vest you wear in jail.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.917
- Look,
it doesn't really matter.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.049
- My hands are tied.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.311
This is what corporate wants,

03:01.355 --> 03:02.965
and we're not gonna make waves
right now.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.968
Carol already threatened
to call C.J. DiBono on us.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.317
- Oh, C.J. DiBono.
- Oh, you don't want that.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.492
- No thank you.
- Mm-mm.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.842
- So you guys know
who that is?

03:10.886 --> 03:11.800
- No.
- No.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.455
- But sounds important...scary.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:16.457 --> 03:17.936
- All right, all right,

03:17.980 --> 03:20.069
we're doing it, everybody,
getting it done.

03:20.112 --> 03:22.637
Ha-ha, let's do it.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.855
Whoo.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.553
Cheyenne?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.250
What--what are you doing here?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.644
- You sent out that email
trying to get everyone to come.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.863
Plus, it would be cool
to make some more money.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.038
Bo's still out of work,

03:33.082 --> 03:34.997
and Harmonica keeps needing
new clothes.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.434
Ugh, I just wish
she'd stop growing already.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.568
- Yeah, well, she's four,
but, um, great.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.525
You're going to love it here.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.440
These people are so cool.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.268
They're--they're passionate.
they're progressive.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.052
I've learned about
four new bookstores

03:47.096 --> 03:49.185
just from the tote bags alone.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.666
- Guys, come on.
You can't be here.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.276
I don't want to call the cops.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.017
- Hey, we've got our permits,
and we're not blocking traffic.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.801
So go ahead, call the cops.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.933
Yeah. Yeah, call the cops.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.021
- Yeah, that's right.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.066
You tell 'em.
You tell 'em, Tommy.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.154
That's Tommy.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.982
He's lead organizer,
total badass.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.376
Got, like, a fight the power,
Malcolm X kind of vibe.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.509
Not--not because he's--
you know,

04:08.552 --> 04:10.075
just the--vibe-wise.

04:10.119 --> 04:13.905
All right, my man, good work.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.472
All right.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.561
- Oh, man,
this is gonna take all day.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.999
It's funny how the cleaning
robot is causing the most mess.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.523
- It always goes after
the Bluetooth speakers.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.394
I think they're in a feud.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.961
- Might the start
of the robot wars.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.180
- Oh, I so do not have time
for this.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.356
I need to be on my phone,

04:29.399 --> 04:31.358
Celine Dion tickets
go on sale today.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.577
- Well, why don't you just
hire somebody on BusyBee?

04:33.621 --> 04:35.100
It's a pretty cool app.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.102
I got a guy to wait in line
to get my Air Jordan 3 Unites,

04:37.146 --> 04:39.931
which you haven't said
anything about, no big deal.

04:39.975 --> 04:43.500
- Or I could wait
for the tickets

04:43.544 --> 04:46.634
and hire somebody do the
actual, you know, work part.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.288
- Your job?

04:48.331 --> 04:49.724
Hire somebody to do our jobs?

04:49.767 --> 04:51.073
- Yeah.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.596
- That's a great idea.
I'm in.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.076
I'll split it with you.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.600
- ♪ Leave them hangin'
on the line ♪

04:56.644 --> 05:02.432
♪ Oh-oh-oh calling Gloria

05:02.476 --> 05:03.564
♪ Gloria

05:03.607 --> 05:04.652
- ♪ Gloria

05:04.695 --> 05:06.784
- So why do you need
everyone's number?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.874
- Oh, I'm, uh,
getting a group text going.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.486
Got this sweet "Norma Rae" GIF
that I've been wanting to use.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.270
- I don't watch
"Real Housewives."

05:14.314 --> 05:16.359
- Wait, where's Tommy's number?

05:16.403 --> 05:17.969
- Oh, he didn't want
to put it on there.

05:18.013 --> 05:21.364
He thinks that you're a spy
from Gateway Subs,

05:21.408 --> 05:23.061
like you're a narc
or something.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.367
- Me? Why?

05:24.411 --> 05:25.803
- Yeah, he's just starting
to wonder,

05:25.847 --> 05:27.675
'cause sometimes companies
send people in

05:27.718 --> 05:29.372
to spy on groups like this,

05:29.416 --> 05:30.591
and you showed up
right when they were

05:30.634 --> 05:32.419
starting to organizing
this protest.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.986
Plus, you've got
that corporate haircut.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.512
Honestly, your whole look
and vibe is very classic narc.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.644
- Okay, did you tell him
that you know me?

05:40.688 --> 05:43.560
- No, I don't want him to think
I'm friends with a narc.

05:43.604 --> 05:44.779
- Look, if it were up to me,

05:44.822 --> 05:45.997
she wouldn't be working here
at all.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.303
Most of you wouldn't be.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.783
- What's going on?
Is everything okay?

05:48.826 --> 05:51.176
- Sayid doesn't want to work
in Housewares.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.700
- Carol's there.

05:52.743 --> 05:55.355
I just don't feel comfortable
working near a crazy person.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.399
- Okay, you know what?

05:56.443 --> 05:58.662
Let's not use the word "crazy."

05:58.706 --> 06:00.055
It's--it's demeaning.
- Mm.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.622
- And it's debilitating

06:01.665 --> 06:04.189
and some other word
that corporate used

06:04.233 --> 06:05.713
that I can't remember,
but fine,

06:05.756 --> 06:07.454
I'll move her into Seasonals
with Justine.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.369
- Uh, no thank you.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.457
I don't need the drama.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.719
I'm a no-drama mama.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.242
I even have a T-shirt
that says that.

06:13.285 --> 06:17.420
- Okay, um, oh, yeah, Nicki.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.900
How's your first day going,
girl?

06:18.943 --> 06:20.118
- It's fine.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.468
- I've got a really fun
assignment for you.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.426
- I know all about Carol.
No, thank you.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.906
- How do you already know
about her?

06:24.949 --> 06:26.995
- From, like, six people.
Sounds like a real maniac.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.650
- Also not a word
we should be using.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.478
- Amy, I think everyone's
just trying to be safe.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.262
People who hurt animals

06:33.305 --> 06:34.481
eventually start
hurting people.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.830
- It's true.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.179
My uncle accidentally ran over
a mongoose,

06:37.222 --> 06:38.963
and then he punched out a guy
at Foodland.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.009
- Okay, can we just stop
talking about this?

06:41.052 --> 06:43.446
The fact is, Carol has to work
somewhere in the store,

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
so she's gonna be
in somebody's department.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.710
- Well, it's obviously
not gonna be Sandra.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.233
I heard Carol freaked her out
so much

06:48.277 --> 06:49.539
she crapped her wedding dress.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.802
- Oh.
- Oh, um, that didn't happen.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.282
- You don't have to be
embarrassed.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.544
It's totally natural.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.546
It happens to lots of brides
at their wedding.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.678
- That's childbirth.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.027
- I didn't crap myself.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.332
Amy, tell him.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.899
- Sandra, she said she didn't
want to talk about

07:01.943 --> 07:03.901
what happened that night;
the rumor stands.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.076
- Oh, man.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.556
- Glenn, you're all about
second chances.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.558
How about Carol works with you?

07:08.602 --> 07:12.736
- Mm-hmm, mm,
but as a floor supervisor,

07:12.780 --> 07:17.132
I'm also sort of a lone wolf,
so...you know.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.744
- All right, well, since
you're all a bunch of babies,

07:20.788 --> 07:23.747
I'll just have Carol work
with me for today.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.836
- See, Amy and I
are the only two people

07:25.880 --> 07:29.449
willing to give Carol
a second chance.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.496
- See, look at my dress.
It's spotless.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.889
- Sure, from the front.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.543
Where's the back?

07:36.586 --> 07:38.153
We need to see the back.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.721
- I mean, I don't have too many
wedding photos of my back.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.679
- That's convenient.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.247
- Okay, uh, let's see.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.509
- Here,
what's that right there?

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
- It's nothing.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.731
- Oh, my God.
Is that  on your screen?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.080
- No, it's just the--

07:52.123 --> 07:53.081
- Oh, my God. Don't touch it.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.386
Sandra, don't touch it.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.910
Oh, my God.

07:55.953 --> 08:01.002
- So, girl,
how is your day going?

08:01.045 --> 08:03.570
- So good.
It's like coming home.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.659
The therapy really helped.

08:05.702 --> 08:09.314
The old me would have been
taping a picture of Sandra to,

08:09.358 --> 08:12.927
like, a sausage and hammering
it over and over and over.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.973
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.975
Wow, then I guess
that's progress.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.542
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, um,

08:19.586 --> 08:23.590
I just needed some help with,
uh, paperwork, you know,

08:23.633 --> 08:24.939
collating, uncollating.

08:24.982 --> 08:30.031
You can, um, start by, uh,
highlighting these.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.555
- Oh, uh, what do you want me
to highlight?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.035
- Whatever seems important,
you know.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.210
The verbs.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.038
Uh, gotta know where
the action is right?

08:37.081 --> 08:39.388
- Sure, it'll be fun
working with you.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.433
So tell me how you've been.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.044
Are you still in
that cute little place

08:43.087 --> 08:44.828
where you had
your Golden Globes party?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.830
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.615
Were you at that party?

08:48.658 --> 08:49.703
- No, I wasn't invited.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.356
I was actually pretty upset
about it.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.011
I stewed outside for hours.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.839
I could have wrung your neck.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.842
- Heh-heh-heh.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.235
- Well, I'm glad you didn't.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.976
Um, you know,

09:02.019 --> 09:07.024
this is actually a lot more
work than I, uh, anticipated.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.678
- Yeah.
- So I think we're gonna need

09:08.722 --> 09:10.854
an extra pair of hands.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.640
- Wow, look at me
back of house.

09:13.683 --> 09:17.513
- Yean, um, you know,
some of these files are--

09:17.557 --> 09:20.168
are classified,
so they just require

09:20.211 --> 09:22.387
a higher level of security.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.563
- For sure.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.174
Uh, is this where you guys
keep the cups?

09:26.217 --> 09:28.611
I'm always seeing people
walking around with cups.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.961
- Um, sorry,
I'm a little confused.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.528
Do I work for Cloud 9?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.748
- Oh, no, no, no,
you don't work for Cloud 9,

09:34.791 --> 09:37.402
unless someone asks,
then you do work for Cloud 9,

09:37.446 --> 09:38.490
but you've never heard of us.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.275
- Yeah.
- Right, so I don't,

09:40.318 --> 09:41.624
but I do.
Well, I don't--

09:41.668 --> 09:43.234
- Oh, my God.
Do you want the job or not?

09:43.278 --> 09:44.975
- I want it. I need it.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.150
I need it.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.587
I haven't worked
in three months.

09:47.630 --> 09:48.936
My alimony is late.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.242
My ex-wife's lawyers
are getting very threatening.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.767
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.203
You say you want the job,

09:55.246 --> 09:58.293
but, you know,
I'm seeing this huge mess.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.642
It still needs to be
dealt with.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.078
- You're right.
There's a lot work to be done.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.690
I'll get right on it.
Sorry, boss.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.648
- Boss?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.432
There's something about that
that I like.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.391
- Probably the power.
- Yeah, I think it's the power.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.088
Mm-hmm.
- Well, boss,

10:11.132 --> 10:12.699
I'm gonna go get some Takis.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.831
- Sounds good, boss.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.920
I'm gonna get on queue
and start Googling seat views.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.793
With Celine you don't want
to be too far away...

10:19.836 --> 10:21.403
or too close.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.319
- Oh, yeah, Dina, what--
- Shh.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.755
Carol left her purse
on the table.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.148
- Wait, no, no, no,

10:27.191 --> 10:28.715
you cannot go
through people's--

10:28.758 --> 10:30.412
- I'm just giving it
a quick once over to make sure

10:30.455 --> 10:32.066
there's nothing with sharp
edges or too pointy.

10:32.109 --> 10:35.069
- Oh, come on, you really think
Carol would bring a weapon

10:35.112 --> 10:36.244
into the store?

10:36.287 --> 10:37.201
I mean,
she's been to therapy.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.551
She's not dangerous anymore.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.031
She's back to being boring.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.076
- Oh, yeah?

10:42.119 --> 10:44.034
Then how do you explain this?

10:44.078 --> 10:45.949
- What are those?

10:45.993 --> 10:47.516
- Well, they're--
they're headphones.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.650
But she could easily use these
to strangle somebody.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.694
- You think?

10:51.738 --> 10:52.913
- Yeah, I do think.

10:52.956 --> 10:56.743
Aha,
how about these?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.440
Bobby pins, dozens of them.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.484
You can hide one in your mouth,

10:59.528 --> 11:00.921
then when
you're Frenching someone,

11:00.964 --> 11:03.793
just slip it in, and boom,
oh, the old poke-and-choke.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.055
- Oh, no.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.753
- Is this a picture
of Janet's son?

11:06.796 --> 11:10.321
- Oh, my God, Sandra's cat
was just the beginning.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.671
This is sick.

11:11.714 --> 11:12.759
- Oh, my God.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.065
Kirkwood Youth Soccer League
schedule?

11:15.109 --> 11:16.632
- She's stalking Janet's kid.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.460
- She even had a Janet
driver's license made.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.636
What is her endgame here?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.725
- What the hell are you doing
in my purse?

11:22.769 --> 11:24.205
- Oh.
- Oh, it's--it's her purse.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.337
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Yeah.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.862
This is--this is all her stuff.
- Yes.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.953
- J-just--just so you know,
I'm--I'm not an--

11:32.996 --> 11:34.215
a corporate spy.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.739
- Oh, you heard.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.045
Yeah,
I didn't really think you were.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.656
- Oh, good, cool, good, good,
same page, cool.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.225
Yeah, it's...
it's just that...

11:44.268 --> 11:45.574
that's kind of
what you would say

11:45.617 --> 11:47.794
if you did think
that I was.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.492
- And "I'm not a spy" is what
you'd say if you were a spy.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.320
- Right, yeah, right,
but in this--

11:52.363 --> 11:53.800
in this instance,
I'm saying I'm--

11:53.843 --> 11:56.977
I'm not a spy, because I'm--
I'm really not spy.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.980
- Hey, Tommy, some guy with no
pants just joined the protest.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.242
Should I give him a sign or...

12:01.285 --> 12:03.374
- Oh, no, no, I'll handle it.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.333
Nice talking to you.
- Yeah.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.682
All right,
I'll see you back out there.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.510
- Yeah, I just made up
the no pants guy,

12:08.553 --> 12:10.425
'cause you were biffing it
so hard.

12:10.468 --> 12:13.297
- I know. I figured.
Thank you.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.520
- Really cutting up
a storm there, huh, Ken?

12:18.563 --> 12:19.913
Did I--did I ask you
to do that?

12:19.956 --> 12:22.480
- Nope, saw the paper,
saw the scissors.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.047
Don't have to draw me a map.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
- Hey, Amy, uh,
Janet is gonna say

12:26.354 --> 12:27.747
that we invaded her privacy.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.444
- But in my defense,
I had no idea

12:29.487 --> 12:30.488
what Carol's purse looks like.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.794
- Yeah--oh, hey, Carol.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.448
- Why were you looking
for my purse?

12:33.491 --> 12:34.928
- I don't know.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.190
Just because everyone's
terrified since you're crazy.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.974
- Dina,
we talked about that word.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.628
- Fine.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.543
Carol, I wanted to go through
your purse,

12:41.586 --> 12:43.458
because you're so silly,

12:43.501 --> 12:45.242
I'm worried you're gonna
stab somebody.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.679
Oh, come on,
all because of Sandra's cat?

12:47.723 --> 12:49.943
- Wait, she's the cat killer?

12:49.986 --> 12:52.859
You made me work
next to the cat killer.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.252
- Ken, just calm down, okay?

12:55.296 --> 12:57.211
- So that's why you had Ken
come in here,

12:57.254 --> 12:58.473
because you're scared of me.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.257
- I can't believe this.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.042
I should call C.J. DiBono.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.086
No, no, no, no.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.392
- You don't need to do that.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.046
You know what?
Why don't you

13:06.089 --> 13:08.570
take your lunch break on me?

13:08.613 --> 13:11.616
- Fine.
It's the least you can do.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.270
- And--and don't worry.
When you get back,

13:13.314 --> 13:15.272
everything is gonna feel
much better.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.144
And, you know,
get what you want.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.319
Go crazy.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.886
I mean, have fun.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.456
- You're buying Carol lunch?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.328
So she gets rewarded
for traumatizing Sandra?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.460
- So that's how it works?

13:29.504 --> 13:32.202
Hey, Sandra, I'm gonna slice
you open while you sleep.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.725
I'll take a smoothie, please.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.206
- Guys, I sent Carol to lunch
so that we could talk about

13:36.250 --> 13:38.730
how we're gonna work with her
moving forward.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.384
- I've got an idea.
Fire her ass.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.733
- I can't.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.779
You can't fire someone
for mental health issues.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.564
- Well, good, because I have
a lot of issues.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.610
For one,
I'm addicted to sex.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.394
- You wish.
- Yeah, I do.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.441
- People call anything
"mental illness" these days.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.226
Like, sometimes I'll lie in bed
all weekend,

13:56.270 --> 13:57.749
because I no longer
take pleasure

13:57.793 --> 14:00.013
in things I used to enjoy.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.058
Does that make me "depressed"?

14:02.102 --> 14:03.668
Yes. It does. Yeah.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.582
- What?
- It seems like it.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.237
- Yeah.
- Ahh.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.588
- Wait, these are different
from the last one?

14:10.632 --> 14:11.763
- Yeah, those are fuego.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.026
The other ones were nitro.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.375
They're night and day.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.506
- Oh, wait, shh.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.291
This is the best part.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.727
- Ooh, she can get up there,
huh?

14:18.770 --> 14:19.989
- Right?

14:20.033 --> 14:21.817
I can't believe you've
never heard Celine before.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.950
- Hey, you guys mind
if I take a quick ten

14:23.993 --> 14:25.603
to get some body wipes?

14:25.647 --> 14:26.909
I'm starting to reek.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.216
- I mean, it's only been, like,
a couple hours.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.218
- Well,
it's a lot of work.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.611
The job post said
"move some boxes."

14:33.655 --> 14:35.396
- Yeah, no, I mean, it's cool.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.876
If it's not the kind of work
you want to do,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.268
we'll just find somebody else
on BusyBee.

14:38.312 --> 14:41.793
- Yeah, I mean, I've got
Ashleigh C, Taylor M...

14:41.837 --> 14:43.012
- Boom.
- Jurgen L.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.187
Ooh, he looks cute.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.929
- No, no,
Jurgen steals all my jobs,

14:46.973 --> 14:48.104
and he just takes
good pictures.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.411
Look,
I can handle it.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.153
I'll make sure to get
the rest of those boxes.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.459
- Ahh, I'm so glad we finally
got some downtime.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.505
Just really gives us a chance
to reset.

14:57.548 --> 14:58.941
- Yeah.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.117
Ooh, okay, white Whitney.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.032
- Look, we don't need
an H.R. rep

15:03.076 --> 15:04.904
hanging around here
auditing us,

15:04.947 --> 15:07.819
writing everyone up
for all the little things

15:07.863 --> 15:10.779
I let slide,
like visible tattoos

15:10.822 --> 15:12.824
and the pictures you put
in your lockers,

15:12.868 --> 15:15.218
and unbuttoning your pants
at lunch.

15:15.262 --> 15:18.526
- To let air in
so the mold doesn't come back.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.614
It's called hygiene.

15:19.657 --> 15:20.920
- Ohh.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.138
- Okay, I can't deal
with that right now.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.924
The point is
that all of that ends

15:24.967 --> 15:27.448
the second Carol
calls C.J. DiBono.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.713
- Is--is that, like,
a restaurant?

15:31.756 --> 15:34.585
- No, it's--like,
it's--it's the H.R. person.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.065
And it doesn't matter
what his name is.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.284
We just don't want him around.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.112
- Yeah, we do not want
C.J. DiBono here.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.504
- Oh, God no.
- Mm-mm.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.812
- Okay, so then when Carol
comes back from lunch,

15:43.855 --> 15:45.335
we're all gonna be
very friendly,

15:45.379 --> 15:47.337
and we're gonna treat her
like she's a valued

15:47.381 --> 15:49.426
and trusted coworker,
yes?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.341
Yeah. Yes. Yep.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.388
- Hey, Carol. Welcome back.
- Oh.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.476
- Hey, Carol.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.173
I just wanted to apologize
for earlier.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.001
We were all really out of line.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.350
- Yeah, what was everybody
afraid of,

16:00.394 --> 16:02.135
that you would kill everybody?

16:02.178 --> 16:03.658
You wouldn't do that.

16:03.701 --> 16:07.575
And even if you did, I'm sure
you'd have a good reason.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.099
- Hey, I know I punched you
in the gut at Sandra's wedding,

16:10.143 --> 16:12.580
so I wanted to offer you
a shot to make us even.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.885
- No, Dina, we're a work.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.018
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.193
That does feel better.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.152
Nice form.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.631
Good hip rotation.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.243
- Glad we did that.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.680
- Hey, Carol, I got you these
muffins as a welcome back gift.

16:25.723 --> 16:30.032
- Oh, thanks, Sandra,
but I'm stuffed from lunch.

16:30.076 --> 16:33.209
So where should I work?

16:33.253 --> 16:37.605
- I am putting you
with the cleaning robot.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.041
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:39.085 --> 16:42.044
The robot's been acting up
and needs a hard reset.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.394
Kind of like you,
so you get it, girl.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.223
- Oh, uh,
you want me to fix the robot?

16:47.267 --> 16:49.051
I don't know much
about technology.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.096
- Come on.
You'll figure it out.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.749
It's idiot-proof.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.056
Not that you're an idiot.
You're the opposite of that.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.624
- Well,
I do have an Android.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.712
- We know.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.279
You make the group text green.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.413
Which I love,
favorite color.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.417
all: One, two, three, four.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.245
No one should be working poor.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.594
One, two, three, four.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.901
- I--I don't know how
to convince him to trust me.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.772
- Maybe you need to show him.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.297
Like, what if you went and
blocked the door or something?

17:17.340 --> 17:19.168
- Well, we can't,
because the permit says

17:19.212 --> 17:20.735
you can't cross the street.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.433
- See, like that. Only a narc
would care about a permit?

17:24.652 --> 17:26.088
- You're right.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.176
You're right.
I'm gonna--

17:27.220 --> 17:29.091
I'm gonna show him.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.266
- Oh, wait.
Actually, Jonah,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.442
can you get me
a salami sandwich?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.227
- Oh.
- What's he doing over there?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.272
We're not supposed to cross
the street.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.621
- Right?

17:37.665 --> 17:40.668
Yeah, he has, like,
no respect for the permit.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.104
- Hi. Hi.
Did you know

17:42.148 --> 17:44.237
that the average
Gateway Subs employee

17:44.280 --> 17:45.499
lives right at
the poverty line

17:45.542 --> 17:49.807
while last year the CEO
made $47 million?

17:49.851 --> 17:51.200
- Wow, good for him.

17:51.244 --> 17:54.508
- No, no, no, no, it's just--
uh, um...

17:55.770 --> 17:59.600
Look, uh, if you eat your lunch
somewhere else,

17:59.643 --> 18:03.560
I will give you $10.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.780
- Okay.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.129
- All right.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.652
Talked him out of it.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.219
Narc wouldn't do that.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.569
Non-narc in the house.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.528
- "Reset button."

18:14.571 --> 18:16.747
Oh.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.888
- What the?

18:26.931 --> 18:28.411
- The Wi-Fi is out.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.674
The Wi-Fi is out.
I--I can't refresh.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.372
Oh, come back.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.156
Celine!

18:38.813 --> 18:41.642
- Carol, honey,
I found a clump of your hair.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.818
I'm gonna put it
in your pocket.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.516
- And again, Carol,
I am so sorry,

18:46.560 --> 18:48.562
but you are gonna be fine.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.825
People get electrocuted
all the time.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.087
It's, like, good for you.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.263
It's a cleanse.
You're gonna feel great.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.743
- What happened?

18:55.786 --> 18:57.092
- Amy electrocuted her.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.225
- Not on purpose,
and she's gonna be fine.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.269
- Oh, no.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.750
What if she's not, though?

19:09.060 --> 19:12.673
- Look, I only have a 20 left,
but if you have Venmo, I can...

19:12.716 --> 19:14.501
- Hey,
I can see what you're doing.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.589
You can't do that.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.634
- And you can't underpay
your workers.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
- You need to get off
of this property.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.247
- Hey, man, you can't talk
to one of my people like that.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.944
- Ooh, one of his people.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.598
- I know. I'm trying not
to focus on that right now.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.556
- This guy's driving away all
my business, and you know how?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.254
He's paying people...
- Ahh!

19:28.297 --> 19:30.473
Fair pay now!

19:30.517 --> 19:31.779
- What the hell?

19:31.822 --> 19:33.259
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- That's my car.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.695
- We raised the wage!

19:36.436 --> 19:38.351
- I can't believe
I lost my place.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.048
Now I'm 613th in line.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.224
I'm gonna be stuck in the upper
balcony with all the heteros.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.704
No offense.
- Oh, no, none taken.

19:43.747 --> 19:44.879
That sounds horrible.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.141
- Ohh!

19:46.185 --> 19:47.273
- What now?

19:47.316 --> 19:48.839
- I think I tweaked my back.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.711
Do you guys have one of those
back support belts?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.713
- Oh, of course.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.410
One will be here any minute,
sir,

19:54.454 --> 19:56.412
along with your palm fronds
and your bowl of grapes.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.675
- So entitled.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.635
Why don't we just do our job
for you?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.158
We should have gone
with Jurgen.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.464
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.507 --> 20:05.900
- You know what?

20:05.943 --> 20:07.467
You guys are a little bit
being like dicks right now.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.729
You're taking advantage of me,

20:08.772 --> 20:09.991
because you know I need
the money.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.167
And yeah, I'm scrounging around
for odd jobs,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.822
and I'm staying on my kid's
flute teacher's couch,

20:14.865 --> 20:16.998
but I'm still a human being.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.833
- I mean,
we'll leave him a big tip.

20:25.876 --> 20:29.140
- Oh, yeah, huge,
assuming the app lets you tip.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.578
- Right, right.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.275
We're fine.
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.365
- Shh.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.714
- Oh, no.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.326
Carol,
don't go for the screwdriver.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.893
And...bzz.

20:48.334 --> 20:52.599
Night-night.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.079
- It was great,
and next Monday

20:55.123 --> 20:57.125
Raise the Wage is doing
another protest,

20:57.168 --> 20:58.605
and Tommy said
he wants me there.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.956
- Oh, wow, so soon?
Already?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.306
- Yeah, he said,
"I need the trashman."

21:05.394 --> 21:06.308
That's me.
I'm the trashman.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.049
It's a compliment.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.181
- Yeah, no,
that sounds like a compliment.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.619
- Yeah.
- Whew, today was a doozy.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.621
Tonight is definitely
a tub night.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.232
- Okay.
- See ya.

21:18.581 --> 21:22.019
- Who the  was that?
