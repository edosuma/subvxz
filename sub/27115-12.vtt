00:02.400 --> 00:02.700
- Previously

00:02.700 --> 00:03.367
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.667 --> 00:06.600
- I want you guys
to come with me

00:06.633 --> 00:08.367
to a place called Solvang.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.233
- Let us just sip wine and...

00:11.266 --> 00:13.600
- You're gonna sip wine?
- No, but I'll sniff it.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.200
Randall and I
made the pact that

00:15.233 --> 00:17.100
we should probably
stop drinking.

00:17.133 --> 00:20.533
- We on the P.J., bitches,
and none of us paid for it!

00:20.567 --> 00:22.266
all: Whoo!

00:22.300 --> 00:23.500
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God, what is that?

00:23.533 --> 00:25.166
- It's the alcohol
freezing machine.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.033
- That does not fit
into my designs.

00:27.066 --> 00:29.333
- I've been sort of confused
as to what my role is.

00:29.367 --> 00:31.100
- I'm gonna bring a bunch
of girls to your room

00:31.133 --> 00:32.367
and just,
like, you know, party up.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.467
- Whoo!

00:35.500 --> 00:37.100
- Do not even talk
to those girls,

00:37.133 --> 00:38.233
or your dick's cut off.

00:38.266 --> 00:39.400
- It's a guys' night, Peter.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.133
- Tell them
to go the (BLEEP) home.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.166
- Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.467
- I just think Carter's,
like, not good for her.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.533
- He doesn't pay for anything.
He doesn't pay rent.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.233
He literally does nothing.
Nothing.

00:51.266 --> 00:53.533
- Carter's ----ing texting me
from boys' night.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.266
- Sit your ass ----ing down
right now and talk about it.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.100
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.633
Oh, my God.
- Wow, here we go.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.633

it's our time ♪

01:06.667 --> 01:11.533

01:52.333 --> 01:54.467
- Hi.
-  Hi.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.433
- You okay?

02:01.633 --> 02:03.200
- I love you too, dude,

02:03.233 --> 02:04.734
but last night
was a little crazy.

02:04.767 --> 02:06.467
- Yeah.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.533
- I do love you, remember,
but this sh-- can't happen.

02:09.567 --> 02:11.533
- Of course I do.

02:11.567 --> 02:14.200
Um...

02:14.233 --> 02:15.467
You sleep in Stassi's room?

02:15.500 --> 02:17.333
- No, I--she didn't have
an extra bed.

02:17.367 --> 02:18.633
- Oh.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.367
- And I--all I had was this
Sur dress in my...

02:22.700 --> 02:26.133
- Last night,
Kristen lost her goddamn mind.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.200
She was knocking
on people's doors,

02:28.233 --> 02:30.200
trying to get cigarettes,
wouldn't go to sleep,

02:30.233 --> 02:31.700
threatening to leave
in the middle of the night.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.333
It was a ----ing sh-- show.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.467
I want you to just chill.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.567
- I need to figure out
how to stop

02:37.600 --> 02:41.467
freaking the (BLEEP) out
every time 'cause...

02:41.500 --> 02:42.600
- So is that what this
was about last night?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.233
'Cause you just
kept saying, like,

02:44.266 --> 02:45.600
Carter was saying
something to you.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.767
- That James came last night.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.467
Carter's texting me
about the boys' thing.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.233
- Why are you doing this
to yourself?

02:52.266 --> 02:54.266
- He's telling me what
I'm supposed to do.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.467
- Kristen claims that
her meltdown was all about

02:57.500 --> 03:00.300
James being at the Mondrian
with the guys,

03:00.333 --> 03:02.367
but I know Kristen better.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.233
She hasn't been happy in
her relationship with Carter.

03:06.266 --> 03:09.133
- I'm the only one
who's feeling this way,

03:09.166 --> 03:10.767
you know what I mean?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.367
- You're the only one
feeling that way.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.567
You're the only one
acting this way.

03:36.367 --> 03:39.467
Drinking sucks
when you get older.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.400
- I thought staycations
were supposed to be fun

03:41.433 --> 03:44.533
and guilt-free.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.266
Do you want to hang
by the pool?

03:46.300 --> 03:48.533
- I do, but I'm scared
to walk to the door,

03:48.567 --> 03:50.533
let alone the pool...

03:50.567 --> 03:53.233
I remember my heydays
where can go out all night,

03:53.266 --> 03:55.166
long multiple days,
and just keep going

03:55.200 --> 03:56.600
and going and going.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.567
Is this strong?

04:02.266 --> 04:03.734
- That's supposed to be
for everybody.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.367
- (BLEEP), that'll do.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.467
And I'm drinking a quarter
of what I used to drink.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.433
This is too--I'm sick as a dog.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.233
- Good for Peter.

04:13.266 --> 04:15.400
I think he hooked up
with that chick last night.

04:15.433 --> 04:16.567
- I did not feel
comfortable about that.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.233
- Really?

04:18.266 --> 04:19.633
- You don't bring girls
up to the room.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.433
Like, that's bad.
- We didn't bring them up here.

04:21.467 --> 04:22.767
- I just didn't feel right
having girls up here.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.367
I just didn't,
and Beau felt the same way.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.600
- I agree with you.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.433
- He was like,
"This is not right."

04:27.467 --> 04:28.700
I mean, let's call the girls
and just let them know.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.600
- Okay, yes, but also--

04:30.633 --> 04:32.700
- It's a lot better to tell
them than them finding out.

04:32.734 --> 04:36.734
- It's pretty refreshing
to see Jax be remorseful.

04:36.767 --> 04:40.700
Now, Jax five years ago,
he probably'd be just moving in

04:40.734 --> 04:42.700
with one of them
about a week later.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.567
You know, they're getting
a new puppy,

04:44.600 --> 04:48.033
and, you know, they just had
their first pregnancy scare.

04:48.066 --> 04:50.700
But doesn't it feel good to
have zero temptation anymore?

04:50.734 --> 04:53.500
Like, just to be in love with
the person you're with and--

04:53.533 --> 04:55.467
- Of course, but I also
don't want to be put

04:55.500 --> 04:58.467
in situations where--like that.
- Yeah.

05:00.667 --> 05:05.033
- What a gorgeous day
for a girls' day.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.767
- Kristen, do you remember
falling last night?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.333
- Oh, yeah, Kristen.
Has Satan left your body?

05:11.367 --> 05:14.567
- You literally fell and were
arguing with us on the ground.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.467
- Yeah.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.433
- You didn't even stand back up
to continue your argument.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.033
You just gave up...

05:23.100 --> 05:24.333
- What's your name?
- I'm Richard.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.367
- Richard, Lala.
Nice to meet you.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.266
Today is our final day
in Solvang,

05:29.300 --> 05:31.633
and we are going to
a winery-slash-ranch.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.767
- How are we doing, ladies?
all: Hi.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.767
- Lala, seven?
- Don't tell me I don't know

05:36.000 --> 05:37.500
how to give these bitches
a good time.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.033
- This looks so good.
- Wowzer.

05:39.066 --> 05:40.500
- I'm not going to drink.

05:40.533 --> 05:41.633
Do you have, like,
a sparkling water?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.600
- I don't have sparkling water.

05:43.633 --> 05:45.266
We have flat water, but I got
some Pellegrino sodas in there

05:45.300 --> 05:46.500
if you want me
to get one of those.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.767
- Ooh, I would love that.
- Want some ice?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.533
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, I got you, Lala.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.066
- I am in Solvang

05:52.100 --> 05:55.100
on a girls' trip
not drinking wine

05:55.133 --> 05:57.500
because Randall thinks
when I drink,

05:57.533 --> 06:00.467
it's just
a horrible combination.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.000
Can I smell it again?

06:08.467 --> 06:11.333
Ooh, this one's good.

06:11.367 --> 06:14.100
This is not easy for me
to not drink.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.033
It's pure torture.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.066
- You're not drinking,
Brittany?

06:19.100 --> 06:20.700
- No, thank you, I'm sorry.
- All right.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.533
- But I will take a water
if you have some.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.000
- I can bring you some water.
- Thank you so much.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.667
- Last night, I got so sick.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.700
I was, like, waking up
every hour to go throw up.

06:28.734 --> 06:31.100
- All of the sudden
I just heard her, like--

06:31.133 --> 06:32.633
- I know. I felt so bad
that you had to hear it.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.500
- I felt like your,
like, esophagus

06:34.533 --> 06:36.367
was gonna
come out of your mouth.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.633
- After, I'm gonna
talk to a doctor.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.433
I want to maybe,
like, get some, like,

06:39.467 --> 06:41.667
tests to see if I am,
like, allergic to something.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.400
- You might have
an agave allergy,

06:43.433 --> 06:44.667
and you drink a lot of tequila.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.567
- No.
What if I can't drink anymore?

06:49.033 --> 06:51.000
Did you talk to Beau?

06:51.033 --> 06:53.100
Do you feel like we were, like,
bitches, or do you feel we--

06:53.133 --> 06:55.033
- We're not bitches.
- Well, 'cause they were, like,

06:55.066 --> 06:57.333
trying to be sweet and,
like, call us and be like,

06:57.367 --> 06:59.367
"Just to let you guys know
there's girls here.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.767
We feel uncomfortable,
blah, blah, blah."

07:01.000 --> 07:02.700
and me and Stassi were like,
"No!"

07:02.734 --> 07:04.567
- No, they should
be doing that.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.367
They have girls over. They're
supposed to act that way.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.500
- I 100% believe
everything that--

07:10.533 --> 07:11.700
- They said, for sure.
- Everybody was saying.

07:11.734 --> 07:14.033
It--yes, I know.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.633
For realsies,
Beau handled that perfectly.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.433
He didn't have to call me
and tell me.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.734
The old me would have been
really freaking mad.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.600
See?
Progress.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.367
- Now that I'm,
like, looking back,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.333
that's why I was like,
"Were we mean to them?"

07:26.367 --> 07:27.700
- I'm probably, like,
not the best influence.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.767
- Look at where we're at.
This is so pretty.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.467
- It's so pretty.
- They have cornhole.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.100
- Oh, my God.
- Sports.

07:38.133 --> 07:40.066
- I suck at it, but I'll play.
- I have cornhole on my deck.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.767
- I love cornhole. We play it
all the time. Let's go.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.467
- Is everybody coming?
- Let's do it.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.667
- I will stay and drink wine
and chillsies.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.033
- I'll stay and drink wine
with you.

07:49.533 --> 07:52.400
- Come, come.
- This is so pretty.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.500
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome, ladies.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.734
- Thanks so much.
I really appreciate it.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.467
- Which wine is that?

07:58.500 --> 08:01.100
- It's the first one we had.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.600
- Yeah.

08:02.633 --> 08:04.600
I don't know how to say it.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.700
- You've seemed
way more normal today.

08:09.734 --> 08:12.533
- I just--
James went away for so long.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.100
- Kristen,
I don't think it's about--

08:14.133 --> 08:17.133
but I know--but you tell
all of us, not just me,

08:17.166 --> 08:19.633
the things that you're sad
about, about your relationship.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.467
- And so are we were talking
about the--me and Carter,

08:22.500 --> 08:24.700
or are we talking about
why I was upset last night,

08:24.734 --> 08:26.033
'cause they're
different things.

08:26.066 --> 08:27.633
- It's bigger than that.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.100
- If you want to talk about me
and Carter, I will tell you

08:29.133 --> 08:31.100
exactly what
is going on with us,

08:31.133 --> 08:32.500
and how it's not great.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.100
all: Oh!

08:36.133 --> 08:37.767
- I think that we're dancing
around the whole ----ing issue

08:38.000 --> 08:40.133
and the fact that you do--
you do all the work

08:40.166 --> 08:42.500
in the relationship, and it's
the same pattern of, like--

08:42.533 --> 08:44.200
- Yes, it is.
Every single ----ing morning--

08:44.233 --> 08:45.734
when he's screaming 'cause he's
not a ----ing morning person,

08:45.767 --> 08:47.166
and he doesn't want
to walk the dogs,

08:47.200 --> 08:49.033
and I'm a bitch, and I'm this.

08:49.066 --> 08:50.467
- But Kristen, you don't need
to be screamed at every day.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.133
- No sh--.
- And I learned now

08:52.166 --> 08:55.100
that you don't actually have
to be screamed at ever.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.734
Like, you don't. Like,
you can be in a relationship

08:57.767 --> 09:01.233
where somebody just loves you
and wants to be around you

09:01.266 --> 09:03.467
and is happy all the time
to be around you

09:03.500 --> 09:05.166
and lifts you up
and supports you

09:05.200 --> 09:07.066
and doesn't demand that
you pay for everything,

09:07.100 --> 09:09.266
doesn't demand that
you take care of everything.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.700
There's a relationship
out there for you

09:12.734 --> 09:14.533
that you deserve.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.500
Behind Kristen's crazy nature

09:17.533 --> 09:21.133
is one of the most
wonderful people I've ever met,

09:21.166 --> 09:24.133
and I just feel like
she deserves to be

09:24.166 --> 09:27.000
with somebody who appreciates
that about her

09:27.033 --> 09:30.567
and gives her that love back.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.633
I feel like Kristen doesn't
feel like she's lovable,

09:33.667 --> 09:37.500
and that really
breaks my heart.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.000
It is so hard for me
to watch this

09:40.033 --> 09:41.500
because I was
in that relationship,

09:41.533 --> 09:42.633
and I learned that
the hard way.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.500
- I agree with you.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.266
It's hard.
It's sad. It's sh---y.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.100
It's just, like,
I feel the need to defend it

09:50.133 --> 09:52.533
because it's not sh---y
all the time.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.734
Like, I just want things
to be good again.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.033
It's like I have a teenage son

09:57.066 --> 09:59.734
playing video games
in my basement sometimes,

09:59.767 --> 10:02.533
and I don't think
Carter's trying hard enough

10:02.567 --> 10:06.200
because he knows he has
a bed to sleep in at night

10:06.233 --> 10:07.767
and an apartment
to wake up in in the morning

10:08.000 --> 10:11.767
and a girlfriend
who's gonna take care of him.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.467
- You should wake up and
have someone be so excited

10:14.500 --> 10:16.700
to be around you.

10:16.734 --> 10:19.033
I'm excited to be around you.

10:20.734 --> 10:22.600
- I'm sorry that I don't want
to have sex with you.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.233
Otherwise, then that
would make things--

10:24.266 --> 10:28.266
- Not even on a girls' trip?

10:28.300 --> 10:29.600
- Coming up...

10:29.633 --> 10:32.200
I have got a top mixologist.

10:32.233 --> 10:35.266
If something doesn't fly,
then Sly will tell you.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.333
- I'm telling you right now,
if our drinks don't end up

10:37.367 --> 10:39.033
on the menu, dude,

10:39.066 --> 10:41.233
I don't know
if I can be a partner.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.700
- ♪ Oh-oh, oh ♪

10:51.734 --> 10:54.300
♪ Anything's possible ♪

10:54.333 --> 10:55.734
- I don't like those flowers
like that.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.734
Pull those dead leaves
off there and--

10:57.767 --> 11:00.367
so you don't see the
bottom of the vase.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.133
Sante.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.300
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.467
- How you doing?
Good to see you.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.166
- Hi.
- Good to see you too.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.333
- When I walk
into this building,

11:08.367 --> 11:10.200
it's, like, a pinch-me moment.

11:10.233 --> 11:14.100
I still am a little beside
myself seeing my name on it.

11:14.133 --> 11:17.033
I love it. I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

11:17.066 --> 11:19.467
- So, I have got somebody

11:19.500 --> 11:22.100
that I met at the
Aspen Food and Wine Festival.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.333
I met her
a couple of times, Sly,

11:24.367 --> 11:26.467
and she's a top mixologist.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.333
I've asked her to come over
and give us her advice.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.333
She is fantastic.

11:32.367 --> 11:35.300
We don't often
bring in a mixologist

11:35.333 --> 11:38.033
for the restaurants
that we've opened,

11:38.066 --> 11:41.133
but TomTom is gonna be
very different to Pump,

11:41.166 --> 11:43.133
to Sur, to Villa Blanca,

11:43.166 --> 11:47.133
because it's gonna be really
focused on the cocktails.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.433
I sent Sly
your cocktail recipes already.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.767
She's gonna look at everything
that you've brought forward.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.300
She's gonna look at visuals.
She's gonna look at cost,

11:54.333 --> 11:58.266
but if something doesn't fly,
then Sly will tell you.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.100
Let's refine this cocktail list
to be the best it can be,

12:02.133 --> 12:04.133
and if she says,
"Oh, this is a load of crap,"

12:04.166 --> 12:06.300
or something, we toss it out.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.000
- I'm sure
she's really talented,

12:08.033 --> 12:11.433
but we've dedicated
months and months

12:11.467 --> 12:13.500
to just our cocktail menu.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.367
Schwartz and I have $100,000
invested in this bar.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.500
We've spent months
working on these cocktails.

12:19.533 --> 12:24.400
At what point does Tom and Tom
get to contribute to TomTom?

12:24.433 --> 12:27.233
I just want to make sure
that she is gonna, like,

12:27.266 --> 12:30.000
give the same amount of time
and effort and everything I--

12:30.033 --> 12:31.700
- But you're not a mixologist,

12:31.734 --> 12:35.266
so she is going to show you
about cross-utilization,

12:35.300 --> 12:37.133
about ingredients that,
you know,

12:37.166 --> 12:39.300
are gonna work
in many different cocktails,

12:39.333 --> 12:41.100
and she's gonna
put it all together.

12:41.133 --> 12:43.166
As I always say,
I know everything

12:43.200 --> 12:45.266
until somebody knows it
better than me, okay?

12:45.300 --> 12:47.000
And then I defer to them.
- Of course.

12:47.033 --> 12:50.033
- She's up there.
She's amazing, and you'll see.

12:50.066 --> 12:51.500
You'll learn something
from her, trust me.

12:51.533 --> 12:54.533
- Yeah, of course.
- We can all make a cocktail

12:54.567 --> 12:59.233
that might cost $30 to make
and take half an hour,

12:59.266 --> 13:01.300
but that's not what
the business is about.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.000
It's about making it
cost-effective, time-effective,

13:04.033 --> 13:06.266
and also about
make it bloody delicious.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.700
I'll see you at Sur
in a couple of days, okay?

13:07.734 --> 13:09.300
- Okay.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.767
- Because we want to be
the best in Los Angeles.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.333
- Yes, yes.

13:12.367 --> 13:15.233
- Are we all on the
same page with that?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.500
- There you go, ladies.
Welcome to Bella Cavalli.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.467
- Oh, my God.
There's baby horses!

13:25.500 --> 13:27.133
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.066
- So we gonna do
some horse riding?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.166
- It'll just be the two of us.
- All right, that's all right.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.300
- You got this, Lala.
- I got this.

13:36.333 --> 13:39.567
- Left hand on that horn.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.333
Left foot in, swing over.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.734
- My horse is way too big
for me to try to do that...

13:48.467 --> 13:51.066
- I haven't been on
a horse in years.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.133
- So Lala,
let's do a couple circles.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.600
- Just to be on an animal
that is that beautiful,

13:56.633 --> 13:58.767
and you can feel it breathing,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.500
and you're kind of just
trusting each other.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.200
- Reach across
with the one hand,

14:03.233 --> 14:04.467
whatever direction
you're going.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.200
- Like this?

14:06.233 --> 14:07.600
- Now just use your
outside and pull back...

14:07.633 --> 14:10.033
- So is that a boy or a girl?
- I don't know.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.300
- Cluck, cluck...

14:11.333 --> 14:13.100
There you go.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.133
Very good.
Nice.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.767
- There's, like, an area
where it looks like

14:18.000 --> 14:19.567
something would come out of it.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.567
- Kristen, stop checking out
the horse's dick.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.467
- Good job.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.066
- I think we should go back
to the shaded non-sh-- area...

14:31.100 --> 14:34.166
Pun intended.

14:39.633 --> 14:43.467
- To be on an animal that size
who feels every emotion

14:43.500 --> 14:45.467
you feel and you just
have to be calm in order

14:45.500 --> 14:48.567
for the horse to stay calm,

14:48.600 --> 14:51.000
it was just, like, good.

14:51.033 --> 14:53.200
- Great, that's great.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.166
How are you doing?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.166
- I don't know, dude.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.533
Like, I'm in a big funk
right now,

14:59.567 --> 15:02.100
and I feel like
it's getting worse, you know?

15:02.133 --> 15:05.367
Like, it's just getting
more real, but it's, like,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.600
getting to this point,
and this sounds so morbid,

15:07.633 --> 15:12.200
but it's like,
my dad is just a memory...

15:15.500 --> 15:18.367
I just miss him a lot.

15:21.300 --> 15:25.300
I've really retreated
from everybody, including Rand.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.266
I've just, like--
because I don't--

15:27.300 --> 15:29.600
it's, like, such a heavy thing.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.467
I'm just, like,
mad that this happened.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.033
- Of course, but I think
Randall understands that.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.033
- He does.
I'm just--Stassi,

15:36.066 --> 15:38.567
I'm just--I love him
so much, Rand.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.567
Randall's doing an amazing job
of just taking care of me

15:42.600 --> 15:46.133
and letting me
be extremely volatile.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.533
I know that
it's not easy for him

15:47.567 --> 15:49.467
because I am so up and down.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.133
I just can't stand
the thought of my dad

15:52.166 --> 15:54.400
not being at my wedding,

15:54.433 --> 15:58.333
seeing me have babies,
all of that,

15:58.367 --> 16:00.367
and my mom pulled me aside
and was like,

16:00.400 --> 16:02.200
"I just want to talk to you,
and, like,

16:02.233 --> 16:03.467
"hopefully
this brings you peace.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.066
"Like, he did call dad
and asked him

16:07.100 --> 16:08.700
if he could have you
and take care of you,"

16:08.734 --> 16:11.066
and I was like,

16:11.100 --> 16:13.567
and there it is.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.467
-  You're
really lucky that you had that,

16:15.500 --> 16:17.400
that you have that
and you know that.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.700
- Yeah...

16:19.734 --> 16:23.567
Stassi, I just feel like
my world just crumbled.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.166
I'm just really
----ed up right now.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.300
- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

16:35.433 --> 16:36.633
- Coming up...

16:36.667 --> 16:38.300
- Before I started therapy,
you said,

16:38.333 --> 16:40.333
"I want to see
something tangible."

16:40.367 --> 16:41.467
- Yeah, but keep searching.
- What's that mean?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.433
What is--okay, so how many?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.734
- I'm not definitely saying
you're ever coming back to Sur.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.433
- What are you guys drinking?
Vodka on the rocks?

17:08.467 --> 17:10.467
- No, I'm not drinking.
I'll have an Arnold Palmer.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.734
- No, I'm not drinking.
- Beer.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.467
- Yeah.
- I don't want alcohol.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.333
No alcohol.
- Dude, we're still on staycay.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.600
Come on.
- I know. I know.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.333
but it's--
drinking's over for me now.

17:18.367 --> 17:21.533
- I love drinking,
but I'm hitting a wall.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.767
- I can't drink, Tom.
I can't.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.767
- Just sit--let it sit in
front of you. It's all right.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.633
You don't need to drink it.
- Okay.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.467
- So I was thinking
we could work on some cocktails

17:30.500 --> 17:32.767
a little bit tomorrow
at TomTom.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.066
Like, we'll bring--
- Let's just bring everything.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.066
- Hey, do you guys have
drinks on the menu?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.767
- We got to wait till Saturday.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
They have a--they have Sly
coming in. Sly is a mixologist.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.500
- You're gonna
make drinks with him?

17:43.533 --> 17:45.000
- Her.

17:45.033 --> 17:47.367
- Oh, I--she's gonna
design the menu?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.467
- No, we're gonna
work together.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.066
It's a collaborative effort.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.567
- Yeah,
it's a collaborative effort...

17:51.600 --> 17:54.400
- So 95% her, 5% you?
- It doesn't matter.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.367
We want what's best
for the bar.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.734
- I'm just curious. What if--
like, if you don't get a drink

17:57.767 --> 17:59.667
on the menu, what have you
brought to TomTom?

17:59.700 --> 18:01.500
- Dude.
- Just asking.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.467
- Hold on. Hold on. Let's--
- My heart and soul.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.100
- Listen, listen.
- Which is invaluable,

18:05.133 --> 18:07.033
my heart and ----ing soul.
- Hold on. Hold on.

18:07.066 --> 18:08.767
- It's a slap in the face
to Tom and Tom.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.700
The one thing that they could
contribute was drinks

18:11.734 --> 18:13.433
because they're good
at making them,

18:13.467 --> 18:15.367
and then you go ahead
and say, "Well, yeah,

18:15.400 --> 18:16.767
"you're great at what you do,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.133
but I'm gonna go ahead
and hire somebody else."

18:20.166 --> 18:22.433
What would make you really mad
going into tomorrow's meeting?

18:22.467 --> 18:23.700
Like, what would
really upset you?

18:23.734 --> 18:25.633
- I could tell you,
if they're like,

18:25.667 --> 18:28.667
"Oh, that diamond ice crust,
like, no, it's too much time.

18:28.700 --> 18:31.033
The smoked drink, oh,
no, that's too much time."

18:31.066 --> 18:32.734
Lisa's like,

18:32.767 --> 18:34.500
"We're gonna have the best
cocktails in West Hollywood,"

18:34.533 --> 18:36.300
and I'm like, "Listen,
if you're gonna ----ing

18:36.333 --> 18:37.767
"throw that sh-- out there,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.066
"these are the things that
are happening right now.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.700
"This isn't, like,
vodka, triple sec,

18:42.734 --> 18:45.433
and ----ing, like,
fresh strawberry puree."

18:45.467 --> 18:48.000
Like, no, no, no, that doesn't
--that doesn't fly anymore.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.400
- Yeah.

18:49.433 --> 18:51.166
- Dude,
I'm telling you right now,

18:51.200 --> 18:54.033
she gave us a mission,
and we ----ing went for it.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.600
If our drinks don't end up
on the menu, dude,

18:56.633 --> 18:58.033
I don't know if
I can be a part of it.

18:58.066 --> 18:59.533
- See, this is why
I was asking.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.000
This is what--this is--
- I'm serious.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.567
- This is what I've been
trying to ask.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.667
- I've never really taken
a moment to think about

19:04.700 --> 19:08.166
what I would do if Tom
actually backed out of TomTom.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.000
I don't know.

19:10.033 --> 19:11.567
Would Lisa still want
to move forward with just me?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.467
Would I want to move forward
without Tom?

19:13.500 --> 19:18.433
Because without Tom,
there's no TomTom,

19:18.467 --> 19:21.467
and I don't want to go
forward with just Tom.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.166
- These are the things that all
the top-notch bars are doing.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.600
They're all doing this,
so we can't not do this.

19:30.633 --> 19:34.166
- And I agree.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.600
- ♪ I don't play
by the rules ♪

19:38.633 --> 19:40.166
♪ I always make them up ♪

19:40.200 --> 19:43.200
♪ Don't play by the rules ♪

19:43.233 --> 19:46.066
♪ Yeah, I don't
play by the rules ♪

19:46.100 --> 19:49.367
♪ I always make them,
I always make them ♪

19:52.066 --> 19:53.600
- With your beer.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.734
- Thank you.

19:55.767 --> 20:00.066
- I love Stassi for wearing
PJs on the P.J.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.133
She was born
for this lifestyle.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.066
- I can't thank you now because
you've, like, damaged me,

20:05.100 --> 20:06.433
and I'll never be able to have

20:06.467 --> 20:08.433
a normal flying
experience ever again.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.166
- Oh, my God.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.767
- Hey.
- Yes.

20:25.533 --> 20:29.033
- Guys, is it crowded tonight?
Because my brain is fried.

20:29.066 --> 20:33.600
- Can I get, uh,
two Diet Cokes?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.166
- Diet Coke.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.033
- Yo, I'm, like,
kind of slap-happy

20:37.066 --> 20:39.000
because I'm that tired
that I'm--like,

20:39.033 --> 20:41.233
everything is making me
giggle...

20:41.266 --> 20:43.767
- I don't feel terrible.
I know I'm exhausted.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.633
I've had two vodka Red Bulls.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.667
Being back at Sur after
stepping off a private jet

20:48.700 --> 20:50.734
is definitely very humbling.

20:50.767 --> 20:54.000
- Well, I don't know how I'm,
like, standing right now.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.734
- I'm like, what is life?

21:06.233 --> 21:09.100
- Hi, guys. How are you?
How are you? I'm James.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.533
- Equality California.
- Hi. Happy to be here.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.066
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.567
- I heard you're gonna
be DJing tonight.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.233
- Yes, yes, we're gonna
have a lot of fun.

21:16.266 --> 21:17.734
Pump used to be
my stomping ground.

21:17.767 --> 21:20.533
I DJed every weekend
for nearly two years.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.166
I'm gonna get
set up over there.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.033
Lisa giving me the opportunity
to DJ this event--

21:25.066 --> 21:26.600
it's a pretty good sign.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.467
- Could we all show
Ms. Billie Lee

21:28.500 --> 21:30.567
the respect that she deserves?

21:30.600 --> 21:34.100
I think she's a great asset
to this organization

21:34.133 --> 21:37.033
because she's speaking
from her personal experience.
