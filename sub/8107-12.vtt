00:48.508 --> 00:49.551
Many children.

00:49.676 --> 00:51.553
This is a great thing, Roz.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.513
I am so happy for you.

00:53.722 --> 00:55.014
Thank you, Mrs. Silver.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.810
Yonatan is a good man,
from a good family.

01:01.855 --> 01:05.525
I know you chose well for me.
I've been blessed.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.756
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

02:50.255 --> 02:54.050
Cross-species mating.
I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.010
Amber and I
have a lot in common.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.514
She's a Cutthroat Bitch,
you cry over Dark Victory.

02:59.681 --> 03:02.517
Bette Davis.
Another strong, assertive woman.

03:02.642 --> 03:04.185
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.895
You like needy.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.106
She's not dying, is she?

03:08.231 --> 03:09.399
Yes. Go away.

03:12.402 --> 03:14.237
I give it two months.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.700
Hundred bucks.

03:20.618 --> 03:23.621
It's not really fair.
You're not objective.

03:23.997 --> 03:25.123
But, I'm all about
the teaching, so...

03:25.248 --> 03:27.166
We're at four months.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.253
You hid this from me?

03:30.378 --> 03:31.588
I was wrong. Okay?

03:31.713 --> 03:33.172
I thought you'd be upset.

03:33.298 --> 03:35.675
I thought you'd
track me down in hallways...

03:35.967 --> 03:37.719
HOUSE: I shouldn't have
discounted the sex.

03:37.844 --> 03:40.763
She's obviously limber enough
to put off the meltdown for two months.

03:40.889 --> 03:43.349
She's not needy.
I don't need needy.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.602
She's scary.
Why does scary need pathetic?

03:45.727 --> 03:46.978
Are you going
to talk to her?

03:47.103 --> 03:49.564
I don't see
that I have any choice.

03:51.733 --> 03:55.445
You're all right with that?
No impulse to save her from me?

03:55.570 --> 03:58.448
I've broken the pattern,
House, which is why this has a chance.

03:58.573 --> 04:01.326
I know you're too suspicious to accept
that without getting out your ruler

04:01.451 --> 04:04.370
and your calipers
and your scanning equipment, so,

04:04.913 --> 04:07.332
go ahead.
Get it out of your system.

04:15.632 --> 04:17.550
Thirty-eight year old female
with loss of bladder control,

04:17.675 --> 04:21.346
blood in her urine and a broken leg
from collapsing at her wedding.

04:21.471 --> 04:24.349
Ampicillin for the UTI,
shiny cast for the leg.

04:24.474 --> 04:27.268
You guys know
Wilson's dating Amber?

04:27.852 --> 04:29.312
- No.
- Wilson and Amber?

04:29.437 --> 04:30.730
I knew.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.192
I asked her out. She said
she'd just started seeing someone.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.487
Cultures were negative for UTIs.
No signs of previous trauma or STDs.

04:37.612 --> 04:38.446
Kidney cancer.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.198
CT was clean for tumors
and kidney stones.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.325
- I thought Amber scared you guys.
- She does.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.285
But she also has legs
that go all the way up to Canada.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.412
So do Canadians. It doesn't mean
I want to date one.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.873
Her sodium's low. Could be endometriosis
in the bladder.

04:48.998 --> 04:52.502
Low sodium could also be from low food.
Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.

04:52.627 --> 04:56.297
Or sodium was absorbed
by a toxin already in her system.

04:56.881 --> 05:00.134
Was it just the legs, or did you
detect something resembling a soul?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.386
She grew on me.

05:01.678 --> 05:04.305
If there's a toxin in her,
it could be carbolic acid.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.556
I'm talking about
the patient now.

05:05.682 --> 05:08.393
That much carbolic acid,
someone would have had to poison her.

05:08.518 --> 05:09.352
Could have been a Cossack.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.187
If this
was 18th-century Poland

05:11.312 --> 05:13.272
and Cossacks were
into household cleansers.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.109
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.527
Suicide's a sin.

05:17.652 --> 05:20.321
Corollary of, "People lie,"
is, "People sin."

05:20.446 --> 05:22.532
And in my
world, "People" includes Jews.

05:22.657 --> 05:23.491
She was getting married.

05:23.616 --> 05:24.742
Hasidic women marry young

05:24.867 --> 05:27.412
so they can start
pushing out little "Hasidlings."

05:27.537 --> 05:28.496
Thirty-eight means a woman

05:28.621 --> 05:30.957
not on anyone's hot list
being pushed onto a guy

05:31.082 --> 05:33.042
who's not on anyone's hot list.
No way out. No way out.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.962
Endometriosis fits better than an
epiphany that her life is meaningless.

05:36.087 --> 05:40.049
We should start her on Als
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

05:40.174 --> 05:44.012
Fine. Check her innards for bad cells
and her home for bad karma.

05:44.137 --> 05:45.805
The carbolic acid should be on the shelf

05:45.930 --> 05:48.224
right next to the
regret and the self-loathing.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.476
TAUB: These people are crazy.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.186
Yeah. She should be self-hating.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.271
I'm not self-hating.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.982
I hate religious people who
are out of touch with reality.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.650
You only marry someone
you met three times

05:57.775 --> 05:59.569
if they're carrying
your little mistake.

05:59.694 --> 06:00.903
What's their divorce rate?

06:01.029 --> 06:04.699
Cleaners are all organic.
Nothing with carbolic acid.

06:04.824 --> 06:06.075
You like how they hook up?

06:06.200 --> 06:09.120
Romance is just
emotional foreplay.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.830
Candlelight meals, flowers...

06:10.955 --> 06:12.874
It's as much a ritual
as anything these people do.

06:12.999 --> 06:16.210
Why not go with someone who's
pre-vetted, shares the same values?

06:16.335 --> 06:17.295
Cut to the quick.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.297
Values may give
you the big picture,

06:19.422 --> 06:22.008
but time together
gives you the little picture.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.551
Does she chew
her food too loud?

06:23.676 --> 06:25.470
Will she leave you alone
during the Final Four?

06:25.595 --> 06:26.804
You commit
to something deeper.

06:26.929 --> 06:27.972
You let the little
surprises slide.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.140
Surprises kill,

06:29.265 --> 06:31.684
which is why you only commit
when there are no more surprises.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.937
And you have
no more surprises for your wife.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.357
Do you think this came up
on date number two?

06:38.483 --> 06:41.110
You ever heard
of a Hasidic Jew into hard rock?

06:41.235 --> 06:44.447
She's listed as
a producer on all of these.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.326
Where there's
rock and roll and sex,

06:48.951 --> 06:51.204
usually, there's drugs.

06:53.748 --> 06:58.002
I'm Baal T'Shuvah. I became Hasidic
about six months ago.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.172
And before six months ago?

07:01.297 --> 07:04.675
Music business isn't exactly
known for its holiness.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.803
Heroin.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.015
But I've been
clean for months.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.561
Yonatan knows

07:17.647 --> 07:19.315
in the broad strokes.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.110
He never actually
asked the details.

07:22.276 --> 07:27.115
Says what's important is the person that
I am now, not the person I was then.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.616
How do you go
all the way from...

07:28.741 --> 07:30.701
I just took a class.

07:30.827 --> 07:32.453
Then I took another class.

07:32.829 --> 07:36.124
And you just completely
left the music business?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.751
Pop music
is considered frivolous.

07:39.377 --> 07:42.755
Same reason we don't
watch TV or go to movies.

07:43.381 --> 07:46.092
Your drug use
may have caused some long-term damage.

07:46.217 --> 07:49.137
We're going to need to take
a hair sample to test for latent toxins.

07:49.262 --> 07:52.098
So, you can never
watch Star Wars again.

08:06.612 --> 08:10.825
You figure that I'll hire you,
if you promise to dump Wilson.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.995
- How did you...
- Wilson had a key.

08:14.162 --> 08:17.540
You figure that I'll make
your life hell at first,

08:17.665 --> 08:20.084
but I'll eventually see
how good you are and keep you.

08:20.251 --> 08:24.839
It's a good plan, don't you think?
Perfectly tailored to your personality.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.346
No, it's not.
You know it's not.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.100
Means you just want to
stay in my orbit,

08:36.225 --> 08:38.227
because you figure I'll eventually
realize that I made a mistake

08:38.352 --> 08:40.271
and you'll be able
to rub my face in it.

08:40.396 --> 08:43.232
I can't wait.
It's going to be awesome.

08:45.276 --> 08:48.070
No, it's not.
And you know it's not.

08:48.863 --> 08:50.364
'Cause you know that
even if I made a mistake,

08:50.573 --> 08:53.242
I'd never admit
that I made a mistake.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.456
Which means that you're just toying
with Wilson to toy with me.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.211
Your goal is pure
feral vengeance.

09:03.878 --> 09:07.673
Innocent bystander,
but there's a greater good.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.259
No, that's not it.

09:11.385 --> 09:15.097
Because a bag of flaming poop
bypasses the bystander.

09:15.890 --> 09:18.893
So, which is it, House?

09:20.311 --> 09:24.148
Am I in this for you?
Or am I in this for him?

09:27.485 --> 09:29.278
Give him back
his sweatshirt.

09:30.238 --> 09:32.156
Pit stains
don't become you.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.418
Treatment had no effect,
rules out endometriosis,

09:44.543 --> 09:46.587
and her hair sample
was negative for residue drugs.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.631
This woman lived
in the fast lane till six months ago.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.591
- Maybe we're missing something.
- She admitted drug use.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.219
Doubt she's holding out
on her days as an asbestos miner.

09:53.344 --> 09:55.471
Cryoglobulinemia
might account for the symptoms.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.931
Except for the one
you missed.

09:57.056 --> 09:59.141
Well, there's no change
in her condition.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.393
HOUSE: I'm not talking
about a new symptom,

10:00.518 --> 10:02.353
I'm talking about one
that presented six months ago.

10:02.478 --> 10:06.524
Look, she's nuts. But we can't just give
her 10 cc of atheism and send her home.

10:06.649 --> 10:12.154
Religion is a symptom of irrational
belief and groundless hope.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.450
Altered mental status, on the other
hand, is a symptom of porphyria.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.578
She didn't develop uncontrollable anger,
crying, anxiety,

10:19.704 --> 10:21.205
she just decided
to go to Temple.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.083
The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher.

10:24.375 --> 10:28.379
She went directly to the extremes of
Hasidism and a life of stringent rules.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.630
She became a masochist.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.340
She didn't like her old life,
so she changed it.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.509
People don't change.

10:34.385 --> 10:36.262
They might want to,
might even need to, but...

10:36.387 --> 10:38.973
Taub gave up a six-figure
plastic surgery career for this job.

10:39.098 --> 10:40.975
That mean he has porphyria?

10:41.100 --> 10:45.479
He switched jobs to save his marriage.
He did it to avoid change.

10:47.106 --> 10:50.901
He's right. You don't suddenly choose
crazy without suddenly being crazy.

10:51.027 --> 10:52.862
No. No.
If she walked away from everything,

10:52.987 --> 10:54.363
to go base-jumping
or live with apes

10:54.488 --> 10:55.698
we wouldn't be
having this discussion.

10:55.823 --> 11:00.244
We would if she was also tinkling blood
out of her over-excited bladder.

11:00.369 --> 11:04.123
Pump Hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

11:09.128 --> 11:10.504
Bloodletting?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.798
Porphyria is a rare
genetic disorder

11:12.923 --> 11:14.925
that causes an over-production
of a certain protein.

11:15.134 --> 11:16.052
Draining the blood relieves...

11:16.260 --> 11:20.598
A hair test for damage from drugs showed
she has a rare genetic disease?

11:20.723 --> 11:23.184
Not exactly.
We're testing her now to confirm.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.102
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

11:25.394 --> 11:27.396
Blood test results
take 24 hours.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.275
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.694
Dr. House has a theory.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.404
A theory based on what?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.325
We'd like
a different doctor.

11:39.450 --> 11:41.660
I assure you that
Dr. House is our best...

11:41.786 --> 11:43.037
Then we will settle
for second best.

11:43.162 --> 11:46.040
Someone who doesn't think my wife
is sick just because she's religious.

11:46.165 --> 11:50.336
If you prefer, I can give your wife
my second-best diagnosis.

11:53.047 --> 11:54.298
Did you know
Wilson's dating Amber?

11:54.423 --> 11:56.634
I have reviewed the chart.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.261
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

11:59.387 --> 12:01.972
that cryoglobulinemia
also fits the symptoms.

12:02.098 --> 12:04.392
Yes. It fits many
of the symptoms.

12:04.517 --> 12:08.270
My wife's body is sick.
Her mind and soul are fine.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.941
You live according to God's
600 commandments, right?

12:12.066 --> 12:13.359
Six hundred thirteen.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.985
Do you understand
them all?

12:15.111 --> 12:16.529
It takes a lifetime
of learning.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.072
But you follow the ones
you don't understand,

12:18.197 --> 12:20.491
because the ones you do understand
make sense and you believe

12:20.616 --> 12:23.035
that the guy who created them
knows what he's doing.

12:23.160 --> 12:23.994
Of course.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.665
So, you will trust my diagnosis,
and you'll let me treat her,

12:27.832 --> 12:30.668
because in this Temple,
I am Dr. Yahweh.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.797
I want a new doctor.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.928
I'm starting her on indomethacin
for the cryoglobulinemia.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.638
People don't change.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.766
For example, I'm going to keep
repeating, "People don't change."

12:45.891 --> 12:49.186
So, alcoholics that successfully
go through treatment don't exist.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.813
They're still alcoholics.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.523
If they never take
another drink as long as they live,

12:52.648 --> 12:54.400
it's only because
they didn't live long enough.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.610
If you're dissatisfied with your life,

12:56.735 --> 12:59.655
changing it is
a symptom of mental health.

13:00.448 --> 13:03.325
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

13:08.456 --> 13:11.333
THIRTEEN: O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.837
What's wrong with her?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.755
Well, it's definitely
not cryoglobulinemia.

13:16.922 --> 13:17.756
(WHEEZING)

13:17.882 --> 13:19.383
Better ask him.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.680
KUTNER:
We kept her on oxygen overnight.

13:24.847 --> 13:28.809
Her respiratory rate's stabilized
and her O-sat's back up to 95.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.895
I saw Amber drop off
Wilson this morning.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.731
Yes. The male always
drives the female.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.816
So what caused
the breathing problem?

13:35.941 --> 13:37.651
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.986
She kiss him or he kiss her?

13:39.111 --> 13:41.697
I missed it. The lab tech
with the tongue stud also pulled up.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.824
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.452
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.413
Actually, we've been trying to ignore
that part of the white board.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.292
I wrote it in black.
I'm always serious when I use black.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.503
- Lupus would explain...
- Maybe she didn't change.

13:55.628 --> 13:57.004
Are you agreeing with me,
or are you making a point?

13:57.129 --> 13:58.088
I'm making a point.

13:58.631 --> 13:59.465
That's going to take longer.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.801
How do we know that the real Roz isn't
who she is now and who she was then?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.929
Can't we say
that her previous life was true,

14:05.054 --> 14:06.639
without making her present one a fraud?

14:06.764 --> 14:08.474
The "life is messy" argument.
Nice.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.351
Explains everything
without explaining anything.

14:10.476 --> 14:13.812
If it's lupus, there's a heart problem
we don't know about yet.

14:13.938 --> 14:16.732
Run her through a stress test.
If she has a heart attack, I'm right.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.359
Or we could wait,
hope that...

14:18.484 --> 14:19.610
You're afraid to give her
a heart attack.

14:19.735 --> 14:20.778
Of course we're afraid to...

14:20.903 --> 14:22.404
No reason to be afraid.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.782
Unless you think I'm right.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.784
It's Wegener's.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.747
But we'll have
the crash cart, just in case.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.296
Oh, my God!
What are you guys doing here?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.885
I had a sudden yen for fusion.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.097
I put a different restaurant in my
date book. I'm firing my assistant.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.182
That's okay. Hi, Greg.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.395
And I call you "Greg"
because we're now social equals.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.607
I call you "Cutthroat Bitch."
Well, <i>quad</i> erat demonstrandum.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.820
And I speak in Latin, because I don't
try to hide what an ass I am.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.697
I assume you'd like
to join us?

15:04.822 --> 15:07.783
It will be easier to observe our
interaction if you're at the same table.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.618
If we ever get seated.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.578
Excuse me.

15:10.744 --> 15:11.579
No, no. I...

15:14.498 --> 15:15.374
We've been waiting for...

15:15.541 --> 15:19.211
Any minute now, she's going to hit him
in the face with your testicles.

15:19.628 --> 15:23.257
She tends to treat...
She tends to treat every event

15:23.382 --> 15:25.259
like it's the last
'copter out of Saigon.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.971
She's the anti-Wilson.
She's a force for evil.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.807
She has an annoying quality.
Perhaps even two.

15:32.016 --> 15:34.852
If I was perfect,
I would date perfect.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.860
You like that.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.029
It's annoying,
but she's good at it.

15:45.154 --> 15:46.864
Wait a second.

15:47.573 --> 15:50.576
This isn't just about the sex.
You like her personality.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.994
You like that she's conniving.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.330
You like that she has
no regard for consequences.

15:54.455 --> 15:57.916
You like that she can humiliate someone
if it serves...

16:00.002 --> 16:01.545
Oh, my God.

16:02.504 --> 16:03.922
You're sleeping with me.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.978
<i>I need you
to go faster, Roz.</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:21.398
<i>A little harder.</i>

16:21.523 --> 16:23.817
I am going harder, damn it.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.325
What if Dr. House was right?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.661
And Roz did make
a radical change.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.122
Lupus is chronic,
but treatable.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.958
And with the treatment,
it would undo the change?

16:40.084 --> 16:42.544
She'll be the way she was
before I knew her?

16:42.753 --> 16:44.630
I don't think it's likely.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.509
Then you don't know for sure.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.849
You'd find someone else.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.061
There isn't someone else.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.355
You've had three dates.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.733
How long have you
been married?

17:04.858 --> 17:05.693
Twelve years.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.319
And is she the one?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.238
We wouldn't still
be together if she weren't.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.948
I love her as much now
as the day...

17:11.073 --> 17:13.617
Well, you should
love her more.

17:14.743 --> 17:18.414
The more you know someone,
the more you should love them.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.630
Okay.
That's enough, Roz.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.261
Your heart's as strong
as a battleship.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.554

Does this mean Dr. House was wrong?

17:34.179 --> 17:36.140
Oh! Oh, my leg!

17:37.015 --> 17:38.475
(ROZ GROANING)

17:42.813 --> 17:44.440
FOREMAN: Heart's strong
enough to prove you wrong

17:44.565 --> 17:46.775
about the change in mental status.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.736
Only proves
this isn't lupus,

17:48.861 --> 17:50.863
just as the leg pain
proves it isn't Wegener's.

17:50.988 --> 17:54.783
Leg pain could be from nerve entrapment.
We're thinking blood clot.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.412
Do an MRI to look for the clot.
Then do an FMRI.

17:58.537 --> 17:59.663
An MRI alone
will detect...

17:59.788 --> 18:00.914
If the clot
hasn't dissolved.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.459
An FMRI could show signs
of a near-ischemic stroke

18:03.667 --> 18:05.335
in post-ischemic
parts of the brain.

18:05.461 --> 18:06.587

18:06.712 --> 18:08.172

- I missed lunch.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.900

are all in there somewhere.

Everything's got a category.

You don't want to be
over-simplified.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.542
No one can describe
themselves in 10 words.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.377
Why would we want to hear
anyone else do it?

18:47.503 --> 18:50.964
So you keep it a mystery.
No categories if no one knows anything.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.883
Do you think maybe you're
over-simplifying me, now?

18:53.008 --> 18:54.009
No.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.554
I'm sure you have many reasons
to keep yourself a mystery,

18:57.679 --> 19:00.349
besides the fact
that you're bisexual.

19:02.017 --> 19:05.687

before the long vacant stare.

FMRI shows no problem areas.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.592
- Go restart her IV.
- What's wrong with it?

19:35.717 --> 19:37.511
Nothing. But like so many
of the procedures

19:37.636 --> 19:40.180
we put patients through, it hurts,

19:40.305 --> 19:43.600
which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.644
This is why you
wanted an FMRI?

19:45.769 --> 19:48.647
It showed she didn't have a blood clot,
which is diagnostically relevant.

19:48.772 --> 19:52.484
And it can show that she's become a
masochist. Also diagnostically relevant.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.611
And it will be cool.

19:56.488 --> 20:01.243
Either explain which part of my analysis
didn't make sense, or go do it.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.246
It isn't cool.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.190
Okay, Roz,
we've got what we need.

20:34.610 --> 20:36.612
Yes. It was impressive.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.035

20:45.037 --> 20:47.039
Oh, sorry.
I was praying.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.874
All through the procedure?

20:48.999 --> 20:53.587
No, when Dr. Foreman apologized, I knew
something bad was going to happen.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.300

Could explain the brain activity.

means no pheochromocytoma

- Could be systemic sclerosis.
- Mental status.

She was in pain.
You no longer think she's crazy?

I can see why
she'd be attracted to that life.

You drank the
Manischewitz-flavored Kool-Aid.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.229

I'm just saying...

Arrhythmia messes
with her blood flow when she stands,

22:46.950 --> 22:48.326
causes low BP and heart rate.

22:48.452 --> 22:51.705
Could also impact
mental status, everybody's happy.

22:55.250 --> 22:59.421
Run an EP study of her heart.
Find where the wiring's verklempt.

23:01.465 --> 23:04.801

You moved in with CB?

23:06.011 --> 23:07.679
No. Apparently,
I moved in with you.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.694
Right atrium normal,
no arrhythmia.

24:45.819 --> 24:49.614
You can become a D'har Master.
Does that require further explanation?

24:49.739 --> 24:51.366
Right ventricle normal.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.535
In college,
I was really into science fiction.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.829
Not like the guys
with the $600 prosthetic ears,

24:55.954 --> 24:56.997
who could swear in Romulan.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.623
That was embarrassing to the rest of us

24:58.748 --> 25:00.625
who just thought
it was good, smart literature.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.043
I went to one convention.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.838
By senior year, I was D'har Master in
the Klingon Empire.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.131
I'm not going
to become Hasidic.

25:06.256 --> 25:09.634
I'm not even going to become
slightly more Reform.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.303
Coronary sinus normal.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.430
You can't have your eyes
opened to something and not act on it.

25:13.555 --> 25:18.768
I haven't had my eyes opened. I just
don't think they're crazy anymore.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.688
Then they have
something to offer.

25:21.813 --> 25:25.066
She's living proof that sane people
can make radical changes, but House...

25:25.192 --> 25:26.484
He thinks that
he can bully...

25:26.610 --> 25:28.236
(SPEAKS HEBREW)

25:28.361 --> 25:29.738
I'm sorry?

25:29.863 --> 25:31.406
I think she's telling you
to stop deflecting.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.200
(SPEAKS HEBREW)

25:34.284 --> 25:36.453
Evil tongue. Gossip.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.289
It's okay. Thanks to the sedative,
you won't remember it.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.333
Words are permanent.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.420
Someday, you'll say something
that you wish you could take back.

25:47.881 --> 25:51.676
Hiss bundle is normal.
Pathways are all clean. No arrhythmias.

25:51.968 --> 25:54.262
If the toaster doesn't work
and the wiring in the house is fine,

25:54.387 --> 25:56.181
problem's got to be
in the city's power grid.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.683
Autonomic nerve disorder.
Could be Riley-Day Syndrome.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.268
Congratulations
on your wedding.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.813
(WHISPERING) You have a rare
and incurable degenerative disease.

26:04.231 --> 26:07.400
I'll set her up for
a thermoregulatory sweat test.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.402
She's bisexual.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.404
What?

26:11.863 --> 26:15.158
I could hear them talking
from inside the MRI.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.285
Hear who?
I heard the word sex.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.995
It was interesting.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.956
- What was interesting?
- It doesn't matter.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.625
We're doctors, we never know what's
going to matter. She said sex.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.586
If she wants to tell you,
when she wakes up...

26:26.711 --> 26:30.298
Yeah. These people aren't
going to change you at all.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.427
I need you
to sleep with Wilson.

26:34.552 --> 26:35.887
Good morning.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.974
He's involved with
an inappropriate woman.

26:39.391 --> 26:42.894
His people are sheep herders,
and Amber's are cattlemen?

26:43.019 --> 26:44.729
He's combined two
of his worst qualities.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.481
His love
for me and his love for need.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.149
And as administrator
of this hospital,

26:48.275 --> 26:50.485
you have to save
your star oncologist.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.444
Wish I could help.

26:51.569 --> 26:54.281
But as administrator, there are
some people in accounting

26:54.406 --> 26:57.200
I'm scheduled
to sleep with first.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.495
Wilson has a pattern
with women.

27:00.620 --> 27:04.582
He saves them, then he betrays them,
which then causes guilt,

27:04.708 --> 27:06.751
which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

27:06.876 --> 27:11.339
For example, a hospital bureaucrat
nearing 40 who has no personal life.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.924
I suggest you go braless.

27:13.049 --> 27:17.012
I get that "sleep with" is your way
of saying I should talk to him...

27:17.137 --> 27:18.596
No, I really mean
"sleep with."

27:18.722 --> 27:22.642
You're not worried this relationship
will fail, you're worried it'll succeed.

27:23.351 --> 27:26.604
That Wilson will no longer
be at your beck and call 2417.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.565
That your best friend
will change.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.484
People don't change
just because they wish they could.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.571
And it bugs you
that he wishes he could.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.198
You'll never lose
your friend, House.

27:37.324 --> 27:40.452
You're the long-distance
runner of neediness.

27:43.038 --> 27:46.082
THIRTEEN: As the chamber heats up, Roz's
body temperature should also rise,

27:46.207 --> 27:49.002
making her sweat and turning
the powder purple.

27:49.127 --> 27:51.046
No change in color
means no sweating,

27:51.171 --> 27:54.466
which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.092
I shouldn't see her
like this.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.428
We could have a diagnosis
as soon as she comes out of the chamber.

27:58.553 --> 27:59.637
It might be better
if you stayed.

27:59.763 --> 28:01.639
It's disrespectful.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.516
I'm sure she imagined

28:03.641 --> 28:06.227
the first time her husband
would see her bare like this,

28:06.353 --> 28:08.396
would be celebrating
their marriage.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.065
Given the circumstances,

28:10.190 --> 28:13.693
I think Roz would
sacrifice modesty to have you with her.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.780
Please. Don't do that.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.699
What? I think it's nice
that you're here.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.826
- I think...
- You think it's sweet

28:22.452 --> 28:24.079
that I care for her modesty,

28:24.204 --> 28:27.123
but that it's archaic
and ultimately irrelevant.

28:27.248 --> 28:30.418
Our traditions aren't
just blind rituals. They...

28:30.835 --> 28:34.214
They mean something.
They have a purpose.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.678
I respect my wife.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.808
And I respect her body.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.143
(BEEPING)

28:47.268 --> 28:49.104
Her body temperature's
stopped climbing.

28:49.229 --> 28:50.063
What's going on?

28:50.188 --> 28:52.565
THIRTEEN: She's having a seizure.
Need a crash cart!

28:53.108 --> 28:54.734
Blankets, too!
She's freezing.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.573
HOUSE: She was supposed
to sweat. And she froze.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.034
<i>KUTNER:
Return to the Planet of the Apes.</i>

29:03.159 --> 29:05.078
Hypothermia caused
the seizure.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.413
What caused the hypothermia?

29:06.538 --> 29:07.789
KUTNER: Could be infection.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.416
THIRTEEN:
Her white blood cell count was fine.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.543
When she was admitted.
She could have picked something up here.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.670
A complication
on a complication?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
Her body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.757
Her body is Wilson.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.008
How do we respond to that?

29:19.134 --> 29:20.593
We accept that he's happy.

29:20.718 --> 29:21.761
We do the opposite.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.888
So, you want us to what?
Send the patient home?

29:24.013 --> 29:27.684
An infection means that something's
been added to the body.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.979
Something that should be expelled.
What's the opposite of that?

29:31.104 --> 29:34.691
Something missing from the body.
Could be an enzyme or a hormone.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.734
Cortisol.
Could be Addison's.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.027
It fits.

29:39.362 --> 29:40.488
Every symptom.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.907
I'll run a cortisol
stimulation test.

29:49.414 --> 29:52.625
Are you sure she doesn't want to just
take you back to her lair,

29:52.750 --> 29:55.962
hang you upside-down,
and deposit her eggs in you?

29:56.588 --> 29:58.756
Excellent disguise, House.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.926
You two are really
that serious?

30:02.051 --> 30:05.346
She's pretty. She's funny.
Maybe she's a little more...

30:05.472 --> 30:06.306
Evil?

30:06.431 --> 30:08.183
...aggressive than
you'd expect for me.

30:08.391 --> 30:12.854
But, I'm happy. Can't I just enjoy
what that feels like for a while?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.397
How many people
have looked at you trustingly

30:14.522 --> 30:16.316
while you gave them
a fatal prognosis?

30:16.608 --> 30:20.028
But you knew it was kinder
to tell them the truth.

30:20.403 --> 30:23.198
Amber compulsively
looks out for number one.

30:23.323 --> 30:26.034
You compulsively look out
for the person that you're with.

30:26.367 --> 30:30.747
Your needs are going to feed
her needs until all that's left

30:30.872 --> 30:33.833
is a Wilson chalk outline
on the floor.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.213
Sorry.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.968
Wow.

30:46.221 --> 30:50.850
That cortisol stuff is great.
Does it work on everything?

30:50.975 --> 30:52.185
I take it
you're feeling better.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.896
Still weak, but, yeah.

30:56.648 --> 31:00.693
You must be so tired.
You should go home and get some sleep.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.237
I'll stay.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.574
I never told you,

31:06.699 --> 31:10.161
but you are much better looking
than Mrs. Silver led me to expect.

31:10.370 --> 31:11.746
She never liked me.
When I was eight,

31:11.871 --> 31:13.790
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

31:14.040 --> 31:14.999
(CHUCKLING)

31:15.583 --> 31:17.126
Your abdomen's
a little swollen.

31:17.794 --> 31:18.628
Is it serious?

31:18.753 --> 31:21.256
It's hard to say. Sometimes
it can mean a liver issue.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.216
We'll have to test.

31:24.008 --> 31:27.095
Oh. Oh, dizziness
is getting...

31:28.513 --> 31:30.306
She's going into shock,
I need another liter of saline!

31:30.431 --> 31:31.558
Type and cross two units!

31:31.683 --> 31:33.685
What's happening to her?

31:37.146 --> 31:38.147
She's bleeding internally.

31:38.314 --> 31:41.609
She's saying the Sh'ma.
She thinks she's dying.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.611
(PRAYING IN HEBREW)

31:44.737 --> 31:47.824
The MRA
shows you're bleeding internally,

31:47.949 --> 31:49.576
but not where it's coming from.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.370
The blood can only
keep you stable for so long.

31:52.495 --> 31:56.124
Our best option
is to open you up and search.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.250
But you can fix it.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.127
If we find the leak.

32:00.211 --> 32:03.298
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

32:04.299 --> 32:05.800
No.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.218
But it could keep you
alive long enough

32:07.343 --> 32:10.179
so Dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

32:15.602 --> 32:16.686
No.

32:19.522 --> 32:20.815
I don't want to have
the surgery.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.818
It's the only chance
you've got.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.447
I don't want to have
the surgery until after sunset.

32:29.198 --> 32:31.909
I'm probably
going to die, anyway.

32:32.452 --> 32:35.872
I just want to share
one Shabbat with my husband.

32:41.169 --> 32:46.049
(WHISPERING) Roz, please.
The Torah commands us to preserve life.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.262
(WHISPERING)
I waited 38 years to find what I wanted.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.516
I can wait
another eight hours.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.190
And I'll leave the rest
to God, okay?

33:09.280 --> 33:11.991
I had her rabbi call.
She's adamant.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.620
She's not a masochist.
She's suicidal.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.538
Nice work, Chase.

33:17.664 --> 33:21.167
Yeah, I should have
had twin rabbis call. Can I go?

33:21.292 --> 33:22.627
We need you.

33:23.628 --> 33:28.257
So, instead of a few days, we now have
a few hours to figure this out.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.176
- Nice work, Chase.
- Why do you need me?

33:30.301 --> 33:34.180
Saying, "Nice work, Chase"
when you're not here is pointless.

33:34.305 --> 33:36.265
Seriously. We need you.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.105
We should X-ray for
malformations of the rib

33:42.230 --> 33:43.606
that could cause arterial twisting.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.733
Malformations don't
cause bloody urine.

33:45.942 --> 33:47.318
She's not suicidal.

33:47.443 --> 33:49.612
She made a commitment
to a new life with her husband,

33:49.737 --> 33:52.699
and she wants
one meaningful experience in that life.

33:52.824 --> 33:53.866
She just met the guy.

33:53.991 --> 33:56.452
Taub just met her and he's already
so in love he's ready to let her die

33:56.577 --> 33:57.870
and take her back
to the home planet

33:57.995 --> 34:01.290
for a burial in
the lava sea of Tormiad.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.084
It's who he might be.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.920
She's connecting with all the years
she's not going to have.

34:06.045 --> 34:09.799
A better way of connecting to those
years is to actually have them.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.344
You want more time?

34:14.721 --> 34:18.015
Joshua got God to make
the sun stand still.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.600
No reason
God can't speed it up.

34:21.561 --> 34:25.148
And by God,
I, of course, mean you.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.902
Told you we needed you.

34:30.361 --> 34:31.612
It's sundown, Roz.

34:31.946 --> 34:34.407
We're taking you back to your room
for your candlelight dinner.

34:34.532 --> 34:37.452
Ready? One, two, three.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.039
It's too early.

34:42.165 --> 34:45.835
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.812
<i>Good shabbos, Roz.</i>

35:06.147 --> 35:09.984
So, you pray, scarf down some challah,
then we can do this?

35:18.868 --> 35:20.328
(DOOR OPENING)

35:24.248 --> 35:26.125
You wanted to see me?

35:28.961 --> 35:30.338
And you came.

35:30.463 --> 35:34.175
I feel pretty confident
it'll be something interesting.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.347
Solve this case
and the job is yours.

35:40.348 --> 35:42.892
Is there a "Drop Wilson"
clause attached to this?

35:43.017 --> 35:45.978
Standard contract
all employees sign.

35:55.863 --> 35:59.242
Why do you have to believe
I have an ulterior motive?

35:59.534 --> 36:04.497
For the same reason I believe a crack
whore is going to have sex for crack.

36:08.084 --> 36:09.877
All my life,

36:11.128 --> 36:13.714
I thought I had
to choose between

36:14.090 --> 36:16.217
love and respect.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.886
And I chose respect.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.098
And with Wilson,

36:23.391 --> 36:25.977
I know what it's like
to have both.

36:29.522 --> 36:31.816
And that beats a fellowship.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.085
Could be DIC.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.925
You've changed.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.176
I hope so.

37:01.012 --> 37:04.891
Normal platelet count
rules out DIC. Good try, though.

37:17.862 --> 37:20.197
(YONATAN SINGING <i>ESHET</i> CHAYIL)

37:45.222 --> 37:47.308
I read that
a hydatid cyst could...

37:47.433 --> 37:49.685
Would affect the lungs,
not the bladder.

37:49.810 --> 37:53.022
I tested her
white cell count again. Normal.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.190
How long till we get
to cut her open?

37:54.315 --> 37:57.109
When I left, he was still singing
Eshet something.

37:57.234 --> 38:01.697
It's the husband's blessing of his wife.
He calls her Eshet Chayil.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.158
Woman of Valor.

38:04.283 --> 38:08.704
"Strength and honor are her clothing.
She laughs at the future."

38:09.246 --> 38:11.248
Because she's an idiot.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.211
Volvulus of the small intestine
could cause bleeding.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.838
She would have
had constipation.

38:19.090 --> 38:22.927
Her value isn't beyond pearls, either.
Because dead people have no value.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.220
Polycythemia vera.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.180
RBC count would be higher.

38:26.973 --> 38:29.350
I need to bring
the light to my face.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.485
KUTNER: Thrombocytopenia.
If it's autoimmune...

38:39.610 --> 38:40.736
FOREMAN: Titers were normal.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.530
Parkinson's would
explain the hypothermia.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.241
Not the bloody urine.

38:46.325 --> 38:49.412
The woman's not just a masochist,
she's a hypocrite.

38:49.537 --> 38:52.790
The commandment to preserve life
comes before all others.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.335
Actually means she's not a masochist.
She's not following all the rules.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.795
Just the ones that please her.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.215
Right. She walked in crazy and explained
how ritual trumps living,

39:01.340 --> 39:02.842
and you decide
it's a beautiful lifestyle.

39:03.009 --> 39:04.802
I know. She's wrong,

39:04.927 --> 39:06.554
but, if there's
nothing more...

39:06.679 --> 39:08.305
HOUSE: Then, the only
meaning is here.

39:08.431 --> 39:10.516
TAUB: But if she thinks
God is there for her,

39:10.641 --> 39:14.311
if she lives her life
believing that God is there...

39:14.437 --> 39:16.063
Then, she dies.

39:19.316 --> 39:24.321
Things aren't where we want them to be,
just because we want them to be there.

39:29.118 --> 39:32.621
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

39:33.956 --> 39:36.625
Hey. Stop that Jew.

39:38.294 --> 39:41.589
Chase hates working on shabbos.
I'm going to make this easier for him.

39:41.714 --> 39:42.757
Stand her up.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.091
She doesn't do
so well on her feet.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.260
Neither do I.
Stand her up.

40:02.359 --> 40:06.155
You can tell all the ladies
at the Mikvah about this.

40:09.158 --> 40:11.202
What did you do?

40:13.412 --> 40:15.164
What are you doing?

40:18.334 --> 40:20.544
Put your hand here.
Press hard.

40:30.763 --> 40:34.350
You have nephroptosis.
Also known as "floating kidney."

40:34.475 --> 40:36.060
The kidney is like
a chandelier.

40:36.185 --> 40:39.188
It's attached to a ceiling
of intestines and blood vessels.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.065
But your contractor,

40:41.190 --> 40:44.193
I think you know who he is,
he hung it with a cheap chain.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.195
It's been hanging
sloppy for years.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.655
Finally,
something shook it loose.

40:47.780 --> 40:50.199
After that,
every time you stood,

40:50.324 --> 40:52.284
your kidney dropped
a few centimeters.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.536
That caused all
of your symptoms.

40:53.661 --> 40:54.995
None of the scans
picked it up.

40:55.121 --> 40:57.164
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.041
She would have been lying down
in surgery, too.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.668
They'd never have found it.

41:00.793 --> 41:01.919
Good chance
she'd never come out.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.045
She'll be all right?

41:03.170 --> 41:04.421
HOUSE: Ultrasound to confirm.

41:04.547 --> 41:07.174
Then, tell Chase to put the kidney
back on the shelf.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.218
The bleed will be nearby.

41:10.177 --> 41:11.554
That's it?

41:12.263 --> 41:13.681
<i>Maze! tov.</i>

41:13.806 --> 41:14.932
Couple hours surgery,

41:15.057 --> 41:17.726
you'll be ready to push out
those 14 children.

41:17.852 --> 41:19.228
(ROZ LAUGHING)

41:22.064 --> 41:24.233
You do it both ways, right?

41:25.067 --> 41:26.193
- What?
- The ultrasound.

41:26.402 --> 41:28.279
You do it standing up
and lying down.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.324
What else would I mean?

41:48.174 --> 41:52.469
I've decided you could do worse
than a female proxy for me.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.611
So, you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

42:09.153 --> 42:10.487
- No.
- You think I've changed

42:10.613 --> 42:12.489
- or Amber's changed?
- Nope.

42:12.615 --> 42:14.116
Then, you've changed.

42:14.241 --> 42:17.119
If you do change, can it be the part
of you that chases me down halls

42:17.244 --> 42:18.913
trying to change me?

42:19.038 --> 42:20.456
Do you know what this means?

42:20.581 --> 42:23.292
That you made
one good dating choice.

42:23.417 --> 42:26.337
The fabric of the space-time
continuum could unravel.

42:26.462 --> 42:30.216
My world could expand.
I could form

42:30.716 --> 42:33.594
a long-term connection,
that isn't with you.

42:33.719 --> 42:37.097
And since you put the darkest possible
construction on everything,

42:37.223 --> 42:39.600
you could end up
losing a friend.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.519
You've thought of all this.

42:44.355 --> 42:47.316
And yet, you're going
along with it.

42:49.318 --> 42:52.238
Are you being
self-sacrificing?

42:53.781 --> 42:56.367
I'll sacrifice a lab rat.

42:56.492 --> 42:58.035
I'll sacrifice a fly.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.247
I'll sacrifice $200
on a mudder at Monmouth Park.

43:01.372 --> 43:03.374
I don't sacrifice self.

43:04.667 --> 43:06.460
Shabbat shalom, Wilson.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.214
<i>Shabbat shalom, House.</i>
