WEBVTT

00:41.583 --> 00:42.835
I'm sorry.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.732
Oh, my God.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.008
Oh, no.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.013
God, that's vile.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.892
My lady, it's nearly time to go.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.610
What's going on in there?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.906
I think I'm gonna stay in the bath.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.035
You and Ruben go. Make a day of it.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.663
He was your brother-in-law, Bibi.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.957
She's your sister.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.167
She needs you.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.545
She doesn't.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.421
Not anymore.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.721
-Michael, no.
-No.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.098
Ursula, you in there?

03:02.224 --> 03:04.351
Michael won't take off his GAA jersey!

03:04.434 --> 03:06.478
-I don't want to.
-Okay, coming.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.820
Urs! Molly, we're leaving now, all right?

03:16.864 --> 03:19.408
At least you've got your smart shoes on.

03:48.937 --> 03:49.771
Hey.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.734
Oh, monkey.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.904
What's up?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.238
Mum won't stop crying.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.450
Well, that's, you know, that's to be…

04:02.117 --> 04:03.118
But how are you?

04:03.619 --> 04:04.620
I don't know.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.956
I keep forgetting he's dead. Is that bad?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.334
No.
That used to happen to me all the time.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.670
I'm going to tell my friends
he died in his sleep.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.088
Okay.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.798
All right. Well, that's a nice idea.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.384
No one RSVP's to a funeral.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.304
How are you supposed to know
how much food to make?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.772
I couldn't bear the thought
of him being all alone.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.398
Yeah. No, of course.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.025
Took a bit of getting used to.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.611
But it's been nice having him here.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.737
Hasn't it, Blanaid?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.157
He looks like he's wearing makeup.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.993
Well, he is wearing makeup.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.539
Maybe turn the heating down a bit,
you know. Just in case.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.087
Why have you got, I mean, why have you p--

06:18.086 --> 06:19.171
Did you see him?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.383
She has him dressed in pajamas.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.968
Pajamas? Why?

06:25.469 --> 06:27.804
She wants to make eternal damnation
all comfy for him.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.306
He had a hard-on.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.935
Last two fingers up to Grace.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.228
The dead prick.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.982
Postmortem priapism isn't uncommon
after a violent death.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.529
Thank you, nurse. That will be all.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.159
Where the hell's Becka?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.316
Oh, my God.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.116
Oh, Jesus.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.243
Sorry, I think that was my fault.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.953
-You-- What are you doing?
-Sorry.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.496
You walked right out in front of me.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.665
What, did you wanna get hit?

07:36.748 --> 07:39.376
No, I was just-- I'm

07:39.459 --> 07:42.337
-I'm late for a--
-God. My leg is banjaxed.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.964
These are yours.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.174
Oh, shite.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.509
Was it cracked before, or…

07:49.887 --> 07:51.513
-Sorry.
-Are you kidding?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.056
I don't know where my head was.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.601
Okay, there's another.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.478
Is this your sandwich?

07:59.146 --> 08:00.230
Yeah.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.608
I think there's some gravel in it.

08:04.443 --> 08:05.360
What? Oh, no.

08:22.961 --> 08:23.962
Mind yourself.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.088
What?

08:26.131 --> 08:26.965
Shit!

08:27.049 --> 08:28.133
Oh, shit.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.765
Shit.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.479
We offer our prayers today
for John Paul Williams

08:40.562 --> 08:43.774
and his adored wife, Grace,
and daughter, Blanaid.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.901
-Along with his sisters-in-law…
-Hey.

08:45.984 --> 08:50.739
…Eva, Ursula, Bibi and Becka Garvey.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.157
-Lord, hear us.
-Becka. Come on.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.117
-Lord, graciously hear us.
-Sorry.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.453
We remember
our brothers and sisters in Christ

08:56.537 --> 08:58.580
who are no longer with us today,

08:58.664 --> 09:03.210
especially Grace Williams' parents,
Bill and Kathleen Garvey.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.711
Decent crowd.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.421
-Lord, hear us.
-They're here for Grace.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.589
Lord, graciously hear us.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.633
Yeah, well,
I didn't think they were here for Elvis.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.512
Let us take a moment now in silent prayer

09:13.595 --> 09:15.764
for our own private intentions.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.003
Oh, Jesus.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.301
All right.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.574
Here at Today show,
good to have you with us as always.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.163
You didn't microwave this, did you?

10:21.246 --> 10:24.291
No, I just-- Yeah, we did.

10:24.917 --> 10:28.837
-You're an animal.
-Sorry. In a rush, but yeah.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.009
Need anything else?
You'll be all right for a couple of hours?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.677
Thirty days lying on my pregnant arse.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.055
I don't think another couple of hours
will kill me.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.224
Why you working on a Saturday anyway?

10:41.433 --> 10:44.061
It's just, you know,
a new claim with a few issues.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.270
What's the matter?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.606
You look awful. You're pale and sweaty.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.484
Well, you know, you're really fat.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.571
Don't have a heart attack.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.243
Please. If anything happens to you,
remember I can't even shit without you.

11:02.955 --> 11:03.956
That's nasty talk.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.207
I know.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.587
And don't worry.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.131
Not about anything, okay?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.928
And don't move. Definitely don't move.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.055
You'll cause damage to the house.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.017
I miss being pretty.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.310
You're still pretty.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.313
You're like a very pretty beach ball.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.025
That's Matt.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.447
I know, but I need him on this.
He's family. Sometimes.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.658
He doesn't know what he's doing,
and he's a lazy bastard.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.076
Theresa, I'm gonna pull rank here.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.580
Shut up. Have you read this one?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.248
Just twice.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.876
Well, get stuck back in there. No.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.630
Bring me back a surprise.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.716
Okay. Like what?

11:57.301 --> 11:58.468
A puppy.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.681
Or chips.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.310
Chips?

12:09.563 --> 12:10.564
Fuck.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.943
You look like you slept in a kennel.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.070
Did you sleep in a kennel?

12:17.154 --> 12:18.989
Last night? No.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.117
Tom.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.744
What did-- Wait, you can't go like that.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.912
Go where?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.831
She's not an Alsatian, Tom.

12:27.915 --> 12:31.335
She can't hear through two floors
of insulation and carpet.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.170
Well, you're wrong there.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.422
You need a smart jacket.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.883
-What do I need a smart jacket for?
-The new insurance claim.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.927
-We need to look into it.
-What new claim?

12:40.677 --> 12:42.638
What new claim?

12:51.772 --> 12:54.233
Jesus. That's enough to retire on.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.275
Yeah.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.110
Well, we've got to make sure
that doesn't happen.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.654
Let's go.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.572
Wait.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.080
John Paul was
an active member of the church,

13:08.705 --> 13:12.543
a devoted family man,
and amateur humorist.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.257
God gave John Paul the strength
to be an unforgettable human being.

13:19.091 --> 13:22.928
And let us give thanks
for the joy he spread his whole life long.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.601
Now, chosen by Grace,
John Paul's favorite hymn.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.922
You don't have to pretend anymore.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.733
-That is hot.
-King of Christmas has arrived.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.736
I made brussels sprouts.
They're overcooked, just as you like.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.862
These are for you.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.615
-All right, my favorite.
-Very, very, very deliberate.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.617
They've been better.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.368
-Anyone for anything else?
-We're fine.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.078
-We have loads.
-You got enough ham? Okay.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.205
Look at them, Donal.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.583
There's women's lib for you.
Heads of the table. Both ends.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.045
Plenty of room
and us men hemmed in like tinned fish.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.630
No offense, Nora.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.257
-You don't have enough space, John Paul?
-I don't know how you do it.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.052
You've got a big house, and still
you manage to make us feel crammed.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.261
I've got no room for my elbows.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.973
Well, that is a terrible, awful,
terrible shame.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.391
Are we starting without Becka?

14:51.475 --> 14:54.144
We were just talking about
why Eva needs a house this size.

14:54.228 --> 14:59.483
-I mean, why wouldn't a spinster…
-"A spinster"? A spinster, everybody.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.944
You could sell this place and give
your sisters their rightful share.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.030
-We don't want to sell our parents' home.
-Yeah, Eva brought us up in this house.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.949
It's all we've got left of them.
Why would we sell it?

15:07.032 --> 15:08.534
He knows all that.

15:08.617 --> 15:12.913
That sentimentality is just
very convenient for Eva is all I'm saying.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.831
-We're here!
-Yay.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.543
-Donal, quick wager on who she's with.
-Hola, chicas!

15:18.085 --> 15:20.379
-It was a junkie last Christmas.
-It was a student.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.840
-I say "stranded Polish builder"?
-Come on, it's Father Christmas!

15:22.923 --> 15:25.676
-No, you're all right, JP.
-Come on. It's for fun.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.970
Hey! Happy Christmas!

15:28.053 --> 15:29.471
-This is Frank, everyone.
-Hiya.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.098
Frank, this is my family.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.516
-Hiya.
-I wouldn't have guessed that.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.851
-And John Paul.
-Frank.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.894
-Frank. Hey.
-I'm only joking with you.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.105
-Are you now?
-How are ya?

15:38.188 --> 15:39.857
Nice to meet you. Are you gonna eat or…

15:39.940 --> 15:42.109
-Please, if you'll have me.
-Yeah.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.570
-This is lovely, you all.
-"Frank."

15:46.029 --> 15:48.574
-That's a very unusual name for a--
-Millennial.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.201
It's an unusual name for a millennial, no?

15:51.285 --> 15:53.078
-Is it?
-I think so. Yes.

15:54.538 --> 15:55.497
Hi, sweetheart.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.085
Go easy on those.
You'll end up the size of your cousin.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.548
What? It's puppy fat.
It's completely normal.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.216
You all right?

16:06.300 --> 16:08.886
You gonna come with us
on the swim tomorrow?

16:08.969 --> 16:09.803
Really?

16:09.887 --> 16:12.389
-Yeah.
-Yeah. That's a nice idea.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.224
-Shall we do that? You're old enough now.
-Yeah.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.517
Do you go swimming every Christmas?

16:15.601 --> 16:18.270
Yeah. We used to do it
with our parents when we were little,

16:18.353 --> 16:20.397
so we kept it up as a tradition, you know.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.566
Did Becka not tell you
that we're tragic orphans?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.193
Come on.

16:24.276 --> 16:27.070
-Have you not done it? You ever done it?
-No. Way too cold for me.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.323
-I'll buy you a wet suit.
-It's not. It takes 30 seconds,

16:29.406 --> 16:31.283
-and then it's, like, balmy.
-You get used to it.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.286
Do what this one does. Put your pinky in.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.622
-Itsy-bitsy. One toe at a time.
-…how dare you?

16:36.705 --> 16:38.457
-Molly, over here!
-Stop.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.917
Over here!

16:46.131 --> 16:47.174
Do you need some privacy?

16:47.758 --> 16:49.968
Well, I'm going to the toilet, JP,
so yeah.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.809
Will you flush for me, please?

17:05.943 --> 17:07.152
This is the last one.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.863
It's for you. It's from all of us.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.699
Is it a dog bed?

17:13.575 --> 17:14.409
What?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.411
Don't ever lower those standards, Gracie.

17:17.538 --> 17:18.413
Okay.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.999
Who wrapped this?

17:25.628 --> 17:27.548
It's a dry robe for after the swim.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.217
-Like yours.
-Yeah.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.095
I love it.

17:34.179 --> 17:38.225
I think there's still one more gift
under the Christmas tree.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.061
Someone must have been very good
this year.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.230
It's for you, my love.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.984
But I didn't bring--
I thought we were doing ours tomorrow.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.989
-Wow.
-Wow.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.536
Look at her face.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.789
I want to see. Let's see.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.043
Isn't it beautiful?

18:05.752 --> 18:06.587
It is, yeah.

18:06.670 --> 18:07.963
There you go.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.089
Let me look at you.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.133
Lucky old Mammy, yeah?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.802
-Come here.
-Let's save that for home, shall we?

18:17.764 --> 18:18.974
All right.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.769
After all that excitement,
I have some news.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.854
Let's hear it.

18:25.898 --> 18:29.610
I just put an offer on a studio in town,

18:29.693 --> 18:32.863
and I'm gonna be opening
my own massage business in the new year.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.282
-Hey!
-Go, becka!

18:35.365 --> 18:39.119
Well, here's to launching a new
venture in a depression with no money.

18:39.203 --> 18:42.372
We're delighted for you.
Anything you need, you just say.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.083
Mam and Dad would be proud. Me too.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.252
It's fantastic. A massage, please.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.338
-Okay.
-Well done, Becka!

18:49.421 --> 18:52.007
-As we are all making announcements…
-Brilliant.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.593
…I've got some news too.

18:54.676 --> 18:55.719
Are you pregnant?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.682
The fuck kind of thing is that to say?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.187
Go on, Eva, love.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.277
So, Gerald, my boss--

19:12.361 --> 19:13.487
And mine.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.365
And John Paul's boss, of course.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.159
He's looking for a new financial director,

19:19.243 --> 19:23.372
and after a lot of thought,
I've put myself up for the promotion.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.499
-Brilliant.
-Yeah.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.503
You're amazing. It's official.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.756
-Well done, honey.
-That's fantastic. Great.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.133
-Nice one. You've earned it, love.
-God.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.970
Wh-- mind my head!

19:38.053 --> 19:39.721
Can you control your child, please?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.390
Control your temper, JP.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.559
Oh, my--

19:44.977 --> 19:46.687
Mammy, I think it's time.
We're heading home.

19:46.770 --> 19:47.938
Get your stuff together.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.858
Blanaid? Get your presents together.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.652
I'll just-- Let's just-- You know.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.820
Don't worry about that.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.655
-No, we should. I want to.
-Come on.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.409
It's not even nine o'clock.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.870
-I'm not telling you what to do, Grace.
-Well, you are.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.122
Wait, no.
We just want you to say what you want.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.165
The odd time to stand up
for yourself, you know.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.418
It's Christmas Eve.
We barely get to see you anymore.

20:09.501 --> 20:12.379
What kind of a prick asks someone
who can't have kids if she's pregnant?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.463
It was a joke.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.382
-Oh, my God.
-It was a fucking joke?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.759
-It came out wrong--
-When are you gonna wake up?

20:17.843 --> 20:19.094
When are you gonna stop?

20:23.390 --> 20:24.474
I'm sorry. I'm so--

20:25.475 --> 20:26.768
I'm really sorry.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.354
-Mammy, come on. Let's go.
-Coming!

20:30.522 --> 20:32.482
Look, I know he isn't easy and…

20:33.984 --> 20:35.944
and I know
you don't think he's a good man,

20:36.820 --> 20:39.448
but he's a good husband,
he's a good father and he makes me happy.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.701
Can you not just let me be happy?

20:48.665 --> 20:51.668
I will see you tomorrow
at the Forty Foot for the swim.

20:51.752 --> 20:52.753
Yeah. Okay.

20:52.836 --> 20:53.962
And it'll be nice, right?

20:55.923 --> 20:56.924
See you there.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.592
Loony.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.974
Fantastic. Great.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.562
I swear to God
if he calls her "Mammy" one more time…

21:10.646 --> 21:12.105
Where's my coat, Mammy?

21:12.898 --> 21:15.317
Please, John… next Christmas.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.665
-Happy Christmas!
-Happy Christmas.

21:29.748 --> 21:32.626
Is your daddy home? Where else
would he be on Christmas Day, says you.

21:33.627 --> 21:36.296
-Happy Christmas, Roger.
-Happy Christmas, Grace.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.840
You look gorgeous.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.925
-Happy Christmas to--
-Happy Christmas.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.511
Box of oysters for a starter.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.888
If you're having a starter
or if you're already set for a starter,

21:44.972 --> 21:46.557
it'll make a lovely amuse-bouche.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.933
That's really thoughtful of you, Roger.

21:48.016 --> 21:51.186
It is--
How long have they been sitting out?

21:51.270 --> 21:52.271
No time.

21:52.855 --> 21:56.316
See, the sister was set to join me
for lunch, and she loves an oyster,

21:56.400 --> 21:58.902
but she had a nasty fall
coming back from the pub.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.864
So that's off the cards,
and I don't eat them myself.

22:01.947 --> 22:05.909
-Oh, no. So, are you on your own, or--
-No, let's not-- no.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.328
Very thoughtful. Happy Christmas.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.706
-Are you taking the boat out--
-I'm not taking the boat out. Nope.

22:10.789 --> 22:11.832
Okay. Happy Christmas.

22:25.721 --> 22:26.722
Fuck.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.891
-Mammy!
-Yeah?

22:28.974 --> 22:30.517
Not you.

22:30.601 --> 22:31.852
Blanaid, where's your mum?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.770
She's upstairs, changing for the swim.

22:39.276 --> 22:46.033
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town

22:46.783 --> 22:49.703
This Christmas

22:50.704 --> 22:56.043
So, just a tiny bit
of vinegar and shallot on there.

22:56.126 --> 23:00.297
No Tabasco this year, Mammy.
I won't make that mistake again.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.507
Here it goes.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.763
-Good?
-Lovely.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.731
Happy Christmas, Mammy.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.274
Happy Christmas, love.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.743
Have you blankets?

23:29.826 --> 23:32.037
Yeah. Becks,
would you mind getting them, please?

23:32.120 --> 23:33.121
Put your cream on.

23:33.205 --> 23:35.374
-Yeah.
-And grab the hot water bottles too.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.460
Yeah. Would you stop ordering me around?
I'm not your wife.

23:39.044 --> 23:39.920
Right.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.048
Do you think one flask is enough?

23:43.131 --> 23:44.967
No, I don't.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.010
Come here. Well done.

23:48.971 --> 23:52.975
Take the bread out at a quarter past.
It'll need to sit for an hour anyway.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.810
It'll be perfect by the time we get home.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.937
-Come on, Blanaid.
-What are you doing?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.898
We're going to the Forty Foot.
We'll be back as quick as we can.

23:59.982 --> 24:01.859
You had a glass of champagne.
You can't drive.

24:01.942 --> 24:03.443
-I'm grand, really.
-No.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.696
You can't drive. You had a large--
Are you kidding me?

24:05.779 --> 24:07.865
-No. I'm perfectly--
-There'll be guards on every corner.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.366
Come on, now. Think.

24:11.118 --> 24:14.204
-Well, maybe you can drive us then?
-Of course I can't. I had a glass myself.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.749
I've not missed a swim since I was little.
I'll be perfectly fine.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.338
Now, why would you go and make a scene
on Christmas Day?

24:24.423 --> 24:28.260
I'm not having Blanaid in a rough sea
with her mother drunk.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.512
Absolutely not.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.226
So sorry, sweetheart.

24:37.728 --> 24:39.146
I just worry too much.

25:15.516 --> 25:16.558
Would you?

25:21.188 --> 25:25.192
"Sorry. We're not gonna make it. My fault.
Too much to drink. Have fun. Kiss, kiss."

25:26.026 --> 25:26.944
What the fuck?

25:27.027 --> 25:29.571
-The prick.
-Yeah. No way. That is not happening.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.217
Looks like it is happening.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.487
Come on, Becka!

26:16.034 --> 26:17.077
Becka!

26:25.169 --> 26:27.337
Don't do that, fuck's sake.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.723
Hey, come on. I'll race you back.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.646
Bibi!

27:01.997 --> 27:03.999
Hey, Long John Silver! How are ya?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.001
See anything you like?

27:06.710 --> 27:07.544
Don't.

27:07.628 --> 27:10.756
It's your fault. They've never seen
a single woman over 40 before.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.134
It's not that. They've just never seen
nipples as gigantic as yours.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.802
Like? You're such a pervert.

27:16.637 --> 27:17.638
My arse.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.232
Well, that's it then.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.859
Just the four of us now.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.612
-Break Mum and Dad's hearts.
-Good job they're dust.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.573
Why would you say that?
It's just one Christmas.

27:36.657 --> 27:38.200
It's not just one Christmas.

27:39.868 --> 27:40.869
We're losing her.

27:42.287 --> 27:46.542
She's not like the girl she was.
She's getting quieter and smaller.

27:47.292 --> 27:49.044
You can't grow in the shadow of the prick.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.505
-She was always quiet.
-That's bollocks.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.673
What's bollocks about it?

27:52.756 --> 27:54.633
It's just not true, Becka.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.762
She wasn't always like that.
He's sucking the life out of her.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.097
She doesn't stand up to him though.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.307
You say anything to her,
and she thinks that you're jealous.

28:02.391 --> 28:03.809
She doesn't thin-- She knows…

28:04.935 --> 28:09.189
She knows that's not why we're…
It's just him getting to her.

28:11.441 --> 28:14.403
Well, we'll just have to wait
till he dies of cancer or something.

28:14.486 --> 28:16.655
Yeah, the best part of her life
will be over by then.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.783
I don't know. He's got gout.
And that ulcer.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.619
Lucky wind, he could fuck off
in the next ten.

28:22.703 --> 28:24.121
Could happen before then.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.165
People get killed every day.

28:27.666 --> 28:28.584
What's that mean?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.919
I mean,
why not give nature a helping hand?

28:31.545 --> 28:33.255
All our worries would be over.

28:38.427 --> 28:41.221
I often think about punching through
that soft spot in his head

28:41.972 --> 28:44.224
-right through to his brain.
-Jesus, Bibi.

28:44.308 --> 28:45.726
I'd feed him to the Hurleys' pigs.

28:45.809 --> 28:48.187
Bury him piece by piece
in their mushroom beds.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.397
More shit for them to grow out of.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.280
Fine! I'd tamper with the brakes
of his shitty Volvo

28:58.363 --> 28:59.948
-if I knew what the fuck I was doing.
-Yeah!

29:00.032 --> 29:01.033
Yes, finally.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.869
Shove him into deep, dark water.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.120
Feed him to the sharks.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.581
Let the seagulls feed off his eyes.

29:07.664 --> 29:11.126
-I'd gouge his eyes out…
-You shove him out of a plane.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.295
-Kill the prick.
-Kill the prick!

29:13.378 --> 29:15.380
I fucking hate him!

29:24.556 --> 29:26.767
"Holy mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,

29:26.850 --> 29:28.268
and at the hour of our death.

29:29.645 --> 29:32.314
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

29:32.397 --> 29:33.857
Blessed art thou amongst women

29:33.941 --> 29:36.276
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.070
Holy Mary, mother of God,

29:38.153 --> 29:40.739
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.

29:42.783 --> 29:44.618
Glory to the Father, and to the Son,

29:44.701 --> 29:45.953
and to the Holy Ghost.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.871
As it was in the beginning,

29:47.955 --> 29:50.791
is now, and ever shall be,
world without end."

29:54.461 --> 29:57.548
And so, as we commit
John Paul Williams to the earth,

29:58.298 --> 30:04.221
in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

30:04.304 --> 30:05.138
Amen.

30:10.018 --> 30:14.022
Everything bad that could have happened
has happened.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.362
-Yeah. I've got it.
-Except that.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.329
Goodbye, my love.

30:32.499 --> 30:34.793
"Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

30:34.877 --> 30:36.795
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,

30:36.879 --> 30:38.922
he leadeth me beside the still waters.

30:39.006 --> 30:40.340
He restoreth my soul.

30:41.008 --> 30:44.178
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.513
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death,

30:46.597 --> 30:47.973
I will fear no evil.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.101
For thou art with me, thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

30:52.144 --> 30:55.230
…preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

30:55.314 --> 30:57.107
Thou anointest my head with oil…"

30:57.191 --> 30:58.233
It's over.

30:58.901 --> 31:02.279
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life,

31:02.362 --> 31:04.489
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

31:06.033 --> 31:07.826
Why did I have to wear
a smart jacket anyway?

31:08.327 --> 31:09.703
We're going to Williams' funeral.

31:09.786 --> 31:13.498
What? No way, yeah?
You can drive me to the pub, but I'm not--

31:13.582 --> 31:16.001
Listen, that family
have claimed four times in the last year.

31:16.502 --> 31:17.711
One year.

31:17.794 --> 31:20.172
Something isn't adding up. We're not
paying out if it's not above board.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.507
But what are we gonna do about it?

31:21.590 --> 31:23.717
I mean, they're not claiming
for a cracked windscreen.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.177
He's fucking dead.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.679
It's only void for suicide
or what you call it? Malicious intent.

31:27.763 --> 31:29.806
Right. Then we find malicious intent.

31:30.349 --> 31:31.642
Under what circumstances?

31:35.312 --> 31:36.813
-What are you doing?
-I'm grabbing the folder.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.024
Do you want someone
who isn't driving to grab it for you?

31:39.107 --> 31:40.192
-Yes.
-Yeah.

31:43.529 --> 31:44.947
Yeah, go to the police report.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.490
So the police are investigating it?

31:47.199 --> 31:50.160
Well, no. Look, nothing suspicious
was found but look at the photo.

31:52.204 --> 31:53.205
Jesus.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.293
Strange way to meet your end, no?

32:00.921 --> 32:02.756
The family will have
their guard down today.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.551
All we need to do is observe and listen.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.304
Who knows if there's foul play here,
but if there is,

32:10.180 --> 32:12.224
the culprit usually shows up
at the funeral.

32:14.768 --> 32:15.936
All right, Columbo.

32:20.983 --> 32:22.109
Sorry for your loss.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.362
Thank you. It is such a loss.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.948
I'm just glad the suffering's over.

32:28.615 --> 32:30.325
-Was he ill?
-No.

32:33.787 --> 32:35.080
I have to…

32:36.331 --> 32:37.332
Well…

32:38.500 --> 32:39.668
Deepest condolences.

32:39.751 --> 32:41.003
Thanks.

32:41.086 --> 32:44.298
Shocking. It's a grisly way to go.

32:45.549 --> 32:48.010
Gerald Fisher. Your daddy's boss.

32:48.594 --> 32:49.636
Ex-boss.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.306
Anything I can do, please.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.266
I'm only a phone call away.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.352
I don't have your number.

33:10.407 --> 33:12.159
Are you joking me? There's no booze?

33:13.493 --> 33:16.205
If you're not serving booze at an afters,
why have an afters?

33:16.288 --> 33:18.373
To honor John Paul's sobriety.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.584
Public pioneer. Private pisshead.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.461
It's no wonder Father Doyle skipped out.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.965
-That's my scarf, Becka.
-I know.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.133
Where you going?

33:28.217 --> 33:29.301
To get a proper drink.

33:29.384 --> 33:30.344
You okay? Becka?

33:30.427 --> 33:32.054
I want that scarf back, Becka.

33:35.307 --> 33:37.559
What? She always keeps my shit.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.899
Hang on a second. This is their house.

33:43.982 --> 33:47.528
Yeah. Well, her house now.

33:49.696 --> 33:50.739
Pretty nice.

33:51.365 --> 33:53.242
On an accountant's salary too.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.701
This doesn't feel right.

33:54.785 --> 33:56.411
It's just 'cause your body's
so weird and long.

33:56.495 --> 33:59.831
I mean going into someone's private home
doesn't feel right, you berk.

33:59.915 --> 34:01.834
-I didn't sign up for this.
-Look.

34:01.917 --> 34:05.420
We're gonna drop in, pay our respects,
sound out the widow,

34:05.504 --> 34:08.507
and then you can go back to practicing
chords or paint your toenails

34:08.590 --> 34:10.634
or whatever you do in your hovel--
Hold the door.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.435
Come on.

34:24.273 --> 34:25.315
Sorry for your troubles.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.694
Well, I came to say goodbye.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.696
Are you going already?

34:30.779 --> 34:33.489
Yeah, I wa--
but I wanted to say goodbye properly.

34:33.574 --> 34:34.449
Goodbye.

34:43.708 --> 34:44.543
Goodbye, Grace.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.800
Which one do you think is the widow?

34:52.509 --> 34:54.261
-Hard to tell.
-We shouldn't be here.

34:57.806 --> 34:58.849
That's her.

35:02.352 --> 35:04.313
So sorry for your troubles, Mrs. Williams.

35:04.897 --> 35:07.649
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.
This is Matthew Claffin.

35:08.275 --> 35:10.903
We're the holders
of John Paul's life insurance policy.

35:11.945 --> 35:13.405
Mrs. Williams is my sister.

35:15.908 --> 35:16.992
My apologies.

35:17.618 --> 35:18.911
The likeness.

35:18.994 --> 35:21.705
I hope you're not here to talk business.
She's been through a lot.

35:26.627 --> 35:27.711
What?

35:27.794 --> 35:30.422
Someone died.
Seriously, have some respect.

35:30.506 --> 35:32.382
Do you think Dad would have
gate-crashed a funeral?

35:32.466 --> 35:33.842
He wouldn't let his business go bust.

35:33.926 --> 35:36.053
-He wouldn't have done this.
-How would you know?

35:42.851 --> 35:45.020
Matt, sorry. Matt.

35:56.823 --> 35:57.866
Condolences.

35:58.492 --> 35:59.576
Thomas Claffin.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.163
Are you related to the deceased?

36:03.747 --> 36:05.707
Yeah. He was our brother-in-law.

36:07.334 --> 36:09.378
Yes. One could see the similarities.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.256
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:12.339 --> 36:14.758
Yeah. We're really gonna miss that prick.

36:16.552 --> 36:20.722
If you wouldn't mind just
leaving us with our grief. Thank you.

36:21.390 --> 36:22.391
Of course.

36:23.308 --> 36:24.309
Excuse me.

36:27.729 --> 36:30.774
Can you just engage your brain a second
before you speak?

36:30.858 --> 36:34.403
Why? He's not the police.
He's just an insurance twat.

36:34.945 --> 36:36.113
Yeah, but what's he doing here?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.877
She's in the back, changing the barrel.

36:51.628 --> 36:55.215
And hopefully her attitude,
the rude bitch.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.052
You?

37:01.096 --> 37:03.765
Yeah, it's me all right.
How do I know you?

37:05.017 --> 37:06.185
Have we…?

37:07.603 --> 37:08.729
I mean, have we ever…

37:08.812 --> 37:12.524
So you nearly kill a man in the morning
but it's just foggy to you by lunch?

37:13.901 --> 37:15.777
Oh, shit.

37:17.154 --> 37:18.614
Sandwich boy.

37:19.281 --> 37:21.950
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

37:22.826 --> 37:23.952
How was your sandwich?

37:25.287 --> 37:26.538
Seriously, how's your leg?

37:27.039 --> 37:28.415
It's mainly my lower back.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.919
Well, if you're laying the groundwork
for a court case, good luck.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.253
Juries love me.

37:36.798 --> 37:38.133
Nice tight jacket.

37:39.843 --> 37:41.220
It's my brother's. It's…

37:42.471 --> 37:45.349
It's not actually mine.
I'll just keep it on.

37:45.432 --> 37:47.267
-Can I buy you a drink?
-No, you're okay.

37:47.351 --> 37:49.520
-I can buy my own. Thanks.
-Okay.

37:50.020 --> 37:53.190
Well, then can you get me one? I'm skint.

37:56.026 --> 37:57.152
What are you drinking?

37:57.903 --> 37:59.696
Gin and tonic, please. Double and slim.

38:00.572 --> 38:01.907
Save you washing up.

38:05.244 --> 38:06.286
Becka.

38:07.704 --> 38:08.539
Matt.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.383
My condolences, Mrs. Williams.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.176
Thomas Claffin, Claffin and Sons.

38:21.677 --> 38:24.137
We're handling John Paul's
life insurance policy.

38:24.221 --> 38:25.389
Insurance?

38:26.056 --> 38:27.933
I haven't even looked
at the policy documents yet.

38:28.016 --> 38:30.894
Well, of course. No.
Thankfully, I'm just here to help.

38:30.978 --> 38:32.020
May I?

38:33.397 --> 38:35.691
Egg and onion?
It's like you knew I was coming.

38:36.775 --> 38:37.609
Did you?

38:38.277 --> 38:40.195
You've had some awful luck recently.

38:40.279 --> 38:41.280
And now this.

38:41.780 --> 38:45.117
It's just the icing on an awful,
horrible cake.

38:45.784 --> 38:48.579
It must have been such a shock,
John Paul's accident.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.247
Well, of course it was.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.292
From any I had with him,
he never came across as a reckless man.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.294
-I'm sorry, is there a problem?
-No.

38:55.836 --> 38:56.837
Not really.

38:57.713 --> 38:59.590
Well, just a couple of questions.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.926
Before we pay out,
we need to go over a few details with you.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.595
Details?

39:06.847 --> 39:08.724
Can I pop by tomorrow?
Would that be convenient?

39:09.808 --> 39:11.143
Day after? You say.

39:11.226 --> 39:14.146
-Yes, but I'd need to--
-You've got a lot on your mind. Apologies.

39:14.229 --> 39:17.065
I'll give you a call. How about that?
We'll keep it casual.

39:19.902 --> 39:22.446
Actually, one quick question,
Mrs. Williams,

39:22.529 --> 39:24.072
if you don't mind while I'm here.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.034
Where were you
the night your husband died?

39:28.118 --> 39:30.078
I know where John Paul was,
but where were you?

39:30.579 --> 39:31.705
I was with my sisters.

39:33.582 --> 39:35.334
Right. Of course.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.294
Think I just met all of them.
Lively bunch.

39:38.253 --> 39:39.463
Well, let me get out of your hair.

39:39.546 --> 39:43.217
This is purely a courtesy visit
to a valued client at a difficult time,

39:43.300 --> 39:45.969
which I have taken up enough of, I'm sure.
I'm just going to…

39:46.720 --> 39:48.138
You know, it's a long ride home.

39:48.722 --> 39:50.140
Have you a paper plate?

39:51.391 --> 39:52.476
Don't worry.

39:54.436 --> 39:55.479
Napkin.

39:57.356 --> 39:58.774
You don't live around here though.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.651
Pretty sure I'd have spotted you.

40:01.276 --> 40:02.528
Well, I was in London.

40:02.611 --> 40:03.654
The Big Smoke.

40:03.737 --> 40:06.865
Yeah. Got back about a year ago.

40:08.408 --> 40:09.701
Shit, it was a year ago.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.037
Yeah. Time flies.

40:14.122 --> 40:15.249
What do you do for yourself?

40:16.124 --> 40:17.668
Well, I work with my brother.

40:17.751 --> 40:18.752
My half-brother.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.922
For the last-- Well, since I got back.

40:22.464 --> 40:25.759
But it's not my end goal sort of thing.

40:25.843 --> 40:27.386
I play bass.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.847
-Bass guitar.
-God.

40:30.931 --> 40:34.935
I had a band in London,
that's why I was there. But we broke up.

40:35.811 --> 40:37.354
Exile in Babylon.

40:39.648 --> 40:40.649
Exile in what?

40:41.233 --> 40:42.526
Exile in Babylon.

40:44.611 --> 40:45.946
What? What are you laughing at?

40:46.029 --> 40:47.656
Nothing. I'm just--

40:48.490 --> 40:51.118
I'm just picturing
all the black-and-white moody photographs

40:51.201 --> 40:53.871
in front of Notting Hill bong shops, like…

40:55.789 --> 40:57.165
So, why'd your band break up?

40:58.333 --> 40:59.626
Apart from the terrible name?

41:01.628 --> 41:02.629
Brexit.

41:05.090 --> 41:09.011
For what it's worth, bassists
are my favorite of all the rhythm section.

41:09.094 --> 41:11.638
Although I have dated more drummers,
in fairness.

41:12.472 --> 41:13.724
But that's just bad luck.

41:15.142 --> 41:16.560
But I'm always lucky in my bad luck.

41:17.311 --> 41:18.312
Is that right?

41:20.522 --> 41:21.565
No.

41:23.734 --> 41:24.818
Not really.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.654
Not anymore anyway.

41:29.865 --> 41:31.116
What is it you do yourself?

41:31.825 --> 41:33.410
I'm a massage therapist.

41:34.494 --> 41:37.789
I have my own business.
It's just small, but…

41:43.337 --> 41:44.379
I have to go.

41:46.298 --> 41:47.132
But listen.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.510
Why don't I give you a freebie?

41:51.094 --> 41:52.095
Make up for nearly killing you?

41:52.179 --> 41:55.015
-No, you're fine. Honestly.
-Oh, no. Come on. I'm good.

41:55.098 --> 41:57.184
I'm actually really good at what I do.

41:58.644 --> 41:59.770
Come here.

42:01.522 --> 42:02.898
You should get this fixed.

42:07.444 --> 42:08.570
There you go.

42:10.280 --> 42:11.490
Now we're connected.

42:35.514 --> 42:37.474
Can I get the same again, please?

42:40.060 --> 42:43.564
-You smell like a pub toilet.
-Do I? Thought it was a kennel.

42:43.647 --> 42:46.733
Well, it's both now, so congratulations.

42:52.656 --> 42:55.367
-What's your problem? Oh, grow up.
-That was mortifying earlier.

42:55.450 --> 42:56.869
No, don't talk to me like that.

42:57.870 --> 42:59.413
-What are you looking for?
-My pills.

42:59.496 --> 43:01.164
What pills? Why are you taking pills for?

43:01.248 --> 43:03.584
-You have no idea how bad things are.
-Well, then tell me!

43:09.298 --> 43:10.924
-I can't swallow, and it's--
-Would you just--

43:11.008 --> 43:14.052
Would you just pull over.
Pull over, for Christ's sake.

43:24.146 --> 43:25.939
I think you need to take some time off.

43:31.028 --> 43:32.529
We're this close to bankruptcy.

43:34.281 --> 43:36.241
What? How? Dad never had any--

43:36.325 --> 43:39.077
Dad's accounting
wasn't one of his greatest talents, okay?

43:39.995 --> 43:42.331
If we have to pay out on this,
the business is finished.

43:42.414 --> 43:45.167
I'm telling you that right now.
We lose everything.

43:49.838 --> 43:51.381
My wife's bedridden.

43:52.341 --> 43:53.884
My first kid is weeks away.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.513
If she even gets that far.
I can't lose the business too.

43:58.472 --> 44:00.641
-I just can't lose the business.
-Hold on a minute. Hey.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.059
Hey, that's not gonna happen.

44:03.644 --> 44:05.145
Right? 'Cause we won't let that happen.

44:07.689 --> 44:10.734
Look, if you think there's something
there to find, well, then we'll find it.

44:16.198 --> 44:17.241
Okay.

44:20.077 --> 44:21.161
Okay.

44:21.870 --> 44:22.913
Thanks.

44:50.691 --> 44:52.109
Jesus Christ!

44:52.192 --> 44:53.735
-Sorry.
-Grace!

44:54.361 --> 44:56.113
Oh, my God. I live on my own.

44:57.114 --> 44:58.532
People don't walk into my house uninvited

44:58.615 --> 45:00.701
unless they're planning
to do something bad to me.

45:00.784 --> 45:02.035
I'm sorry. I should have knocked.

45:04.413 --> 45:07.207
Meals for one.
That's what's ahead of me too now.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.084
It's more fun than it looks.

45:10.127 --> 45:11.211
It's not.

45:15.132 --> 45:16.341
I did a stupid thing.

45:18.093 --> 45:19.136
What?

45:19.720 --> 45:23.473
That insurance detective
was asking me a load of questions earlier.

45:23.557 --> 45:26.351
He's not a detective, Grace.

45:26.435 --> 45:29.396
He's the insurance dick.
He's just a creep.

45:29.479 --> 45:32.983
He asked me where I was
the night John Paul died.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.195
I said I was with you.

45:37.529 --> 45:38.906
I said I was with my sisters.

45:41.909 --> 45:43.160
Why would--

45:43.869 --> 45:45.746
I'm just gonna turn the…

45:48.916 --> 45:50.125
I don't know why I did it.

45:51.126 --> 45:53.003
I just panicked, I think. I-- He--

45:53.795 --> 45:56.507
He made me feel really uncomfortable
and I just got worried.

45:57.216 --> 45:59.176
Does it mean I'm a suspect?
Am I a suspect?

45:59.259 --> 46:01.094
What do you mean a suspect?

46:02.429 --> 46:06.058
It was an accident. There--
I mean, there's no inquiry.

46:06.141 --> 46:07.643
-What do you mean?
-But I was on my own.

46:07.726 --> 46:10.604
There's nobody to confirm.
I was waiting for John Paul to come home.

46:10.687 --> 46:14.107
Grace! They're insurance men
who don't want to pay out.

46:14.191 --> 46:16.068
That's all it is. I mean, come on.

46:16.151 --> 46:17.319
Okay.

46:17.819 --> 46:20.489
But what if it jeopardizes the claim?
I mean, I can't afford to--

46:22.157 --> 46:23.158
We'll back you up.

46:23.951 --> 46:27.287
We'll just say we were with you, you know.
It's not far from the truth, is it?

46:27.788 --> 46:29.957
We were planning to hang out
that day anyway. It's fine.

46:31.083 --> 46:32.584
It will be fine. Don't worry.

46:34.586 --> 46:37.172
-Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.
-No. Just-- Sorry.

46:37.256 --> 46:39.842
Just-- It's just prosecco.

46:41.093 --> 46:43.428
With a bit of vodka.
I'm stopping tomorrow.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.401
Hey.

46:58.485 --> 46:59.903
We've got a problem.

47:00.612 --> 47:01.780
Yeah. Can you come round?

47:10.038 --> 47:11.081
Jesus.

47:11.582 --> 47:15.085
He's dead. He's in the ground.
He's Satan's problem now.

47:15.169 --> 47:16.795
She said she was with us?

47:16.879 --> 47:18.755
Yeah, she's just shone a light
on everything we did.

47:18.839 --> 47:20.215
So, it's our problem now.

47:20.299 --> 47:24.178
The prick is dead, and we've got
our sister back. That's all that matters.

47:24.261 --> 47:25.762
We can't let them
bring the police into this.

47:25.846 --> 47:28.599
The police? I've got three kids.
I can't go to prison.

47:28.682 --> 47:29.766
Just calm down.

47:30.601 --> 47:31.894
No one's going to prison.

47:31.977 --> 47:33.770
Oh, my God.
You look so much like Mam right now.

47:33.854 --> 47:36.231
Fuck's sake, Bibi.
We just all need to be on the same page.

47:37.649 --> 47:39.318
And we keep Grace out of this.

47:40.944 --> 47:42.321
She can't find out what we did.

47:47.659 --> 47:51.330
We just stay calm,
and we look out for each other.

47:53.207 --> 47:54.958
-Give me your hands.
-No. I'm not doing it.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.376
-Come on!
-Fuck's sake.

48:02.132 --> 48:04.384
We just look out for each other
like we always have.

48:06.261 --> 48:07.179
Right?

48:07.262 --> 48:08.263
Always.
