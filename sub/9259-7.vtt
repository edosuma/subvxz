01:05.553 --> 01:08.113
[Woman] 
No. No.

01:08.222 --> 01:12.454
No! No! Please!

01:12.560 --> 01:16.052
No! No! God!
[Yelling]

01:16.163 --> 01:19.826
No! Don't!
No, don't do this!

01:19.934 --> 01:23.597
Don't! Let me go!
Let me go! Don't do this!

01:23.704 --> 01:27.868
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Oh, God.

01:27.975 --> 01:31.411
Let me go! Oh, God! Oh, God!
You're hurting-

01:31.512 --> 01:34.948
You're hurting-
No! No!

01:35.049 --> 01:39.543
- You're hurting me. No.
- [Groaning]

01:39.654 --> 01:42.214
No. No, God.

01:42.323 --> 01:46.123
No! No! No!

01:46.227 --> 01:49.196
Not so hard.
I told you no bruises.

01:53.434 --> 01:57.234
[Whimpers]
Stop. Oh, God. Please!

01:57.338 --> 02:00.330
Don't do this!

02:00.441 --> 02:02.568
Please, don't do this!
No! No!

02:02.677 --> 02:06.841
[Sobbing]
Oh, God, don't do this.

02:06.947 --> 02:09.780
- [Moans]
- Please! No!

02:13.954 --> 02:16.980
You wanna say Thursday?

02:17.091 --> 02:19.321
I'm not sure.

02:19.427 --> 02:21.895
Oh, uh...

02:21.996 --> 02:24.294
before I forget.

02:24.398 --> 02:27.265
I love Neiman's.

02:27.368 --> 02:29.268
[Chuckles]

02:29.370 --> 02:33.602
Oh, I have a perfect pair
of shoes to go with this.

02:33.708 --> 02:37.337
From now on though,
get a gift receipt.

02:37.445 --> 02:39.345
Um-

02:41.482 --> 02:44.576
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

02:46.454 --> 02:49.184
What we do together is important.

02:49.290 --> 02:53.886
Whatever it is or why,
that energy has to come out.

02:53.994 --> 02:58.090
Buying into the shame is what's wrong,
not what we do in there.

02:59.967 --> 03:03.027
In there is what the gifts are for,
not the small talk.

03:06.307 --> 03:08.275
Next Thursday's fine.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.841
[Monica] / don't need to tell you what drugs
are doing to our streets.

03:14.949 --> 03:17.440
You live with it every day.
The purpose of this meeting...

03:17.551 --> 03:22.488
is to outline new initiatives
that we're taking to change things.

03:22.590 --> 03:27.027
To lay out the facts, dispel rumors
and get your input.

03:27.128 --> 03:30.291
I mean, if any of you have any ideas
of how we can be more effective...

03:30.397 --> 03:32.297
I'm listening.

03:32.399 --> 03:34.333
What are you gonna do
so different?

03:34.435 --> 03:37.666
I mean, 'cause all these years
I heard a lot of talkin'.

03:37.772 --> 03:42.072
- [All Agreeing]
- And all I see is more sidewalk chalkin'.

03:42.176 --> 03:45.942
- [All Agreeing]
- / agree with you.

03:46.046 --> 03:49.413
For every dealer and banger we put in jail,
three more take his place.

03:49.517 --> 03:53.817
/t's because the culture of wealth
that's been created by the sale of drugs...

03:53.921 --> 03:58.085
has sent a very clear message
to our kids: Now hiring.

03:58.192 --> 04:02.060
I think putting more officers on the street
will make it harder to do business.

04:02.163 --> 04:04.028
Increase gang intervention.

04:04.131 --> 04:07.066
Restored and expanded
after-school programs.

04:07.168 --> 04:10.501
/ mean, kids have to have a place to go to.
They have to have things to do.

04:10.604 --> 04:13.368
Also, more aggressive
drug education.

04:13.474 --> 04:16.341
It all can work.
It just requires patience.

04:16.442 --> 04:19.571
- How long we supposed to wait?
- [All Agreeing]

04:19.680 --> 04:23.047
You know, we didn't have
the resources before that we have now.

04:23.150 --> 04:26.517
These new policies allow us
to confiscate property...

04:26.620 --> 04:29.487
that's been paid for
with drug money.

04:29.590 --> 04:33.458
We're taking the dealers'profits
and using it against them...

04:33.561 --> 04:35.927
to improve your lives.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.022
/ think it's time
that they pay the bill...

04:39.133 --> 04:42.068
for all the pain and suffering
that they've caused.

04:42.169 --> 04:44.103
[All Agreeing]

04:44.205 --> 04:49.040
[Billings] Romeo Barnes.
Took a head shot, close range.

04:49.143 --> 04:51.077
Romeo, poor Romeo.

04:51.178 --> 04:53.169
Witness here works
at the methadone clinic.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.046
Says he saw our victim, a black female,
arguing with another black male.

04:57.151 --> 05:00.177
A few minutes later heard shots.
Saw the shooter take off on a motorcycle.

05:00.287 --> 05:02.187
All right,
let's start up a canvass.

05:02.289 --> 05:05.224
Have D.W.P. check the storm drains
in case he tossed his piece.

05:05.326 --> 05:07.226
Let's talk to methadone man.

05:09.063 --> 05:10.963
So, you saw the shooter book?

05:11.065 --> 05:14.034
Yeah, I know I said that earlier,
but just to be clear here...

05:14.134 --> 05:16.625
I didn't actually see anybody
do any shooting.

05:18.105 --> 05:21.006
Right. Did you recognize
the guy driving off on the bike?

05:21.108 --> 05:24.134
- Never seen him before.
- What about the woman he was arguing with?

05:24.245 --> 05:27.078
- Never seen her before.
- Victim?

05:27.181 --> 05:32.642
Never seen him before. Hope you're not
counting on me to be more helpful than that.

05:32.753 --> 05:35.244
Wouldn't dream of it.

05:35.356 --> 05:39.725
God bless you, and thank you
for cracking down on these gangsters...

05:39.827 --> 05:44.093
so my kids can go to school one day
without being afraid of getting shot.

05:44.198 --> 05:47.167
[Applause]

05:47.268 --> 05:50.965
But aren't we creating
a bigger problem?

05:51.071 --> 05:54.871
White police officers have been swarming
on our neighborhood...

05:54.975 --> 05:57.068
- since day one.
- [Man] Yeah.

05:57.177 --> 06:00.772
And now they wanna take the black
and the brown man's property...

06:00.881 --> 06:03.509
if they think he's up to no good.

06:03.617 --> 06:07.815
Now it should be noted
that Mr. Mitchell is a convicted felon...

06:07.922 --> 06:12.791
who spent 13 years in prison
for distributing crack cocaine.

06:12.893 --> 06:17.455
Excuse me.
So, you don't believe in rehabilitation?

06:17.564 --> 06:22.263
What you're saying is the police can change,
but a brother can't?

06:22.369 --> 06:27.568
Rehabilitation presumes
that a person's behavior has changed.

06:27.675 --> 06:32.703
Oh. Tried and convicted again
by judge and jury.

06:32.813 --> 06:37.773
See, but the problem with this is,
the police aren't a jury of our peers.

06:37.885 --> 06:42.982
- [All Agreeing]
- / grew up in Farmington.

06:43.090 --> 06:47.424
It was an okay place to live
until the summer of 1984.

06:47.528 --> 06:50.656
That is when
the crack cocaine epidemic hit.

06:50.764 --> 06:53.927
Turned this place
into something else overnight.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.298
That's why / became
a peace officer...

06:56.403 --> 06:59.930
to help to bring Farmington
back to the place that I remember.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.167
Now look, with God's help
and your support...

07:02.276 --> 07:05.211
law enforcement is a solution.

07:05.312 --> 07:08.679
- We are not the problem.
- [Man] /t's a sellout.

07:11.118 --> 07:15.111
David Aceveda, city councilman
for this district.

07:15.222 --> 07:19.750
When someone is arrested,
the law says innocent until proven guilty.

07:19.860 --> 07:21.953
The reason for that
is people make mistakes.

07:23.230 --> 07:26.825
Under this policy,
that burden falls on you, sir.

07:26.934 --> 07:29.164
And you. And you.

07:29.269 --> 07:32.796
To prove that you didn't buy your house
by selling contraband.

07:32.906 --> 07:35.170
Otherwise, they can
take your property...

07:35.275 --> 07:39.143
sell it to the highest bidder,
and they keep the money.

07:39.246 --> 07:43.478
Which we funnel back
into neighborhood programs...

07:43.584 --> 07:46.018
and into making
this community safer.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.884
There has been abuse and corruption
in nearly every city...

07:48.989 --> 07:51.048
that this policy
has been tried.

07:51.158 --> 07:55.458
Which is why I cannot support it
without strict regulations.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.292
You're trying to fix something
that isn't broken.

07:58.399 --> 08:02.460
No. No, it's my duty to put
the best interests of Farmington...

08:02.569 --> 08:05.538
ahead of a social experiment,
however well-intentioned.

08:09.743 --> 08:13.645
[Monica]
Councilman.

08:13.747 --> 08:16.545
Getting me up there under
the pretext of soliciting public support...

08:16.650 --> 08:18.550
and then undermining me?

08:18.652 --> 08:20.847
Thanks for the crash course
in sandbagging.

08:20.954 --> 08:22.854
I came willing to be convinced.
I wasn't.

08:22.956 --> 08:26.289
Congratulations. You pushed half that crowd
into Antwon Mitchell's hands.

08:26.393 --> 08:30.853
Oh, that's a slippery slope, using the bogeyman
to ride roughshod over people's rights.

08:30.964 --> 08:32.864
Don't you have enough
to do on the city council?

08:32.966 --> 08:36.366
Or is this some power trip,
doing my job as well?

08:38.105 --> 08:41.768
Actually, my job duties now include
vice-chairing the police committee.

08:41.875 --> 08:45.208
Helping oversee how these seizures
are implemented.

08:47.014 --> 08:51.610
Well, I guess we'll need to figure out
how to get along then.

08:51.718 --> 08:53.845
Learn to do what I say,
and we'll be just fine.

08:59.193 --> 09:02.094
[Men, Women Chattering]

09:07.234 --> 09:10.067
[Mackey] Romeo did time
for moving crack. Possession, assault.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.138
But he was clean
the last 10 years.

09:12.239 --> 09:14.332
Doesn't sound like he got shot
for minding his own business.

09:14.441 --> 09:17.035
Anything else
on the motorcycle gunman?

09:17.144 --> 09:19.908
Uh, not the most
cooperative block.

09:20.013 --> 09:22.379
That's gonna change.

09:22.483 --> 09:26.510
- Pull in Vendrell to help you.
- Shane?

09:26.620 --> 09:29.111
Yeah. You're the one
who sold me on his credentials.

09:29.223 --> 09:32.522
Like I said,
Shane's a good cop.

09:32.626 --> 09:35.288
Maybe Shane's Vice intel
gets us to Antwon Mitchell.

09:35.395 --> 09:39.024
You won't find Antwon anywhere
near anything this low-level.

09:39.133 --> 09:43.570
Small world. Even 12 degrees of separation
between this and him will get us closer.

09:44.705 --> 09:46.605
Hey. New girlfriend?

09:46.707 --> 09:50.768
I got socks older than her. She gave me something
on that methadone whack you're working.

09:50.878 --> 09:53.847
- Is she reliable?
- Yeah, I know her. Talk to her regularly.

09:53.947 --> 09:57.246
Bust her every couple of weeks
for petty stuff, like shoplifting.

09:57.351 --> 10:00.149
She's just trying to keep
her and her mom fed.

10:00.254 --> 10:02.518
[Mackey]
So tell us about Romeo.

10:02.623 --> 10:06.354
Romeo wasn't using no more.
He's my mom's N.A. sponsor.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.360
Her slanger was trying
to get her back on the "H. '"

10:08.462 --> 10:11.295
Romeo's been stepping
to him hard, to leave her be.

10:11.398 --> 10:13.525
What's this dealer's name?

10:13.634 --> 10:17.400
Alls I know he rides a loud-ass motorcycle.
It shake the house.

10:19.373 --> 10:21.637
- Where's your mom now?
- Probably trickin' to get low.

10:21.742 --> 10:23.642
Five or six places
/ usually find her at.

10:24.778 --> 10:26.678
You think you could show us?

10:26.780 --> 10:29.715
Can I get some Starburst first?

10:29.816 --> 10:32.512
I thought the deal was
we'd be working our own shit.

10:32.619 --> 10:36.282
The captain knows you got the street hookups.
Smart to bring you in.

10:36.390 --> 10:38.654
But first you gotta
check this out, man.

10:38.759 --> 10:42.786
We borrowed one of our garage sting
hidden cameras for a little personal use.

10:42.896 --> 10:45.831
Ladies and gentlemen, the man
who put the "pimp" in pimp juice.

10:45.933 --> 10:48.902
- [Radio: /ndistinct]
- [Shane] Who's the babe?

10:49.002 --> 10:50.993
[Mackey]
Friend of Claudette's. Blind date.

10:51.104 --> 10:55.700
We'll spare you the awkward hellos
and skip straight to the painful good-byes.

10:55.809 --> 10:57.037
Excellent.

10:57.144 --> 10:59.339
- You still cold?
- I'm fine.

10:59.446 --> 11:02.347
I'm sorry again about cranking
the air-conditioning.

11:02.449 --> 11:04.679
- Oh, it's all right.
- I guess so.

11:04.785 --> 11:08.687
Cooler climes are just hardwired
to my Northern European D.N.A.

11:08.789 --> 11:12.418
[All Laughing]

11:12.526 --> 11:15.654
- Oh, this is me.
- Well, listen. We should get together again.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.925
- Maybe, uh, this weekend.
- Oh, I'm-

11:19.032 --> 11:21.557
I'm gonna be in Kansas City.

11:21.668 --> 11:23.761
[All Laughing]

11:23.870 --> 11:28.136
- Well, uh, call me when you get back.
- Sure.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.744
[All Laughing]

11:34.147 --> 11:38.243
- Bye then.
- Yeah, okay. See you.

11:38.352 --> 11:40.820
Looks like his next date
is gonna be with some hand cream.

11:40.921 --> 11:43.913
No, no, wait, wait.
This is the big finish.

11:44.024 --> 11:45.992
/'m lost and /'m found

11:46.093 --> 11:49.187
- And I'm hungry like the wolf
- Hungry like the wolf

11:49.296 --> 11:51.389
- Strut on a line
- The line

11:51.498 --> 11:55.992
[Continues, /ndistinct]

11:56.103 --> 11:58.594
Mouth is alive

11:58.705 --> 12:01.936
D.N.A. like that, his parents
should've chlorinated the gene pool.

12:02.042 --> 12:05.375
Hungry like the wolf

12:08.081 --> 12:10.276
All right, look.
We're looking for a horse dealer...

12:10.384 --> 12:13.512
works, uh, by the methadone clinic
over on Seymour.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.815
Wonder if you guys can track down
a name while we chase down...

12:15.922 --> 12:18.083
thejunkie mom
who witnessed the killing?

12:18.191 --> 12:20.557
You know anything else
about this dealer?

12:20.661 --> 12:22.993
Rides a Wink bike. Loud.

12:23.096 --> 12:26.395
He was- He was whacked
by some slanger.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.298
He works off a motorcycle.

12:29.403 --> 12:32.201
Street soldiers are a little
below my need to know, man.

12:32.306 --> 12:35.207
That sounds like Freebo.
He got a rice rocket.

12:35.309 --> 12:37.209
- Temper too.
- Yeah, we're gonna find him.

12:37.311 --> 12:40.439
- Why?
- To lock his ass up on this shooting.

12:40.547 --> 12:44.381
Hey, we gave you a name to keep our boy
clear of this, not so you can take him down.

12:44.484 --> 12:48.716
Now remember, you're paid
to protect my business.

12:48.822 --> 12:51.655
If some smoke goes and kills
a fellow asshole, I got no issue.

12:51.758 --> 12:54.818
But he grudge-whacked a drug counselor,
and that shit ain't right.

12:54.928 --> 12:58.728
Also, I make sure the investigation
seals off with him.

12:58.832 --> 13:01.858
Doesn't work its way
up the food chain to the big fish.

13:01.968 --> 13:04.596
Someone else gives him up,
there's no guarantee of that.

13:04.705 --> 13:07.868
I'll make a couple calls.
Try and locate that cat.

13:07.974 --> 13:10.238
Good boy. Holla.

13:11.645 --> 13:13.545
Holla.

13:15.115 --> 13:17.345
[Monica]
/ got a murder for you two.

13:17.451 --> 13:21.148
65-year-old white female,
shot during a home invasion.

13:21.254 --> 13:23.688
- Run it through Vic.
- We're reporting to Mackey?

13:23.790 --> 13:27.089
On this one.
Looks gang-related. His domain.

13:27.194 --> 13:29.321
That a problem?

13:29.429 --> 13:33.331
Of course not. I just- I know
he's got his hands full.

13:33.433 --> 13:38.996
/ understand you're confiscating Maurice
Webster's house over those three pot plants.

13:39.106 --> 13:42.098
He was distributing drugs.
Selling 'em out of that house.

13:42.209 --> 13:45.110
/ guess even a hummer bust
like this brings in a chunk of change...

13:45.212 --> 13:47.646
for you and the D.A.'s office
to divvy up.

13:53.253 --> 13:55.414
Why don't you and I go somewhere?

13:56.957 --> 13:58.857
- Could we have the room for a minute, please?
- Sure.

14:02.863 --> 14:05.354
Debate's fine.
Insubordination isn't.

14:05.465 --> 14:07.626
The D.A. doesn't call over
to ask for a detective...

14:07.734 --> 14:10.328
any more than you can tell them
what prosecutor to use.

14:10.437 --> 14:12.337
Why were we put on
the Webster case?

14:12.439 --> 14:16.102
I've enough on my plate without
second-guessing the D.A.'s mood swings.

14:16.209 --> 14:19.440
If I'm part of some backroom deal,
why don't you just lay it out for me?

14:19.546 --> 14:21.912
Does my office down there
look like a back room?

14:22.015 --> 14:26.884
All that manpower thrown at a case.
The guy turns out to be a nobody.

14:26.987 --> 14:29.251
But they grab his house anyway.

14:29.356 --> 14:32.086
The detective in me
wonders who benefits.

14:32.192 --> 14:36.788
Well, maybe the detective in you should get down
to your assigned crime scene...

14:36.897 --> 14:39.491
before a reprimand
hits your desk.

14:42.569 --> 14:46.096
Either she's lying or the D.A.'s office is,
or they both are.

14:46.206 --> 14:48.731
So it's not that she's another woman
who took the job you're supposed to have?

14:48.842 --> 14:50.810
- No.
- Just checking.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.971
Shot in the back twice.
There's no sign of forced entry.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.140
- [Dutch] Who found the body?
- The husband and daughter.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.514
- [Man] Over there.
- Detective Wagenbach. Detective Wyms.

14:59.619 --> 15:02.417
[Claudette] Our condolences.
Could we ask a few questions?

15:02.522 --> 15:04.717
- [Dutch] You found the body?
- My father and me.

15:04.825 --> 15:08.886
I picked him up at the library,
and we came home, and-

15:08.995 --> 15:11.429
- What, uh- What time was that?
- Around 11:00.

15:11.531 --> 15:14.125
- Tell them-Tell them about the car.
- Oh, oh.

15:14.234 --> 15:18.694
This morning when we left, I saw a car full
of Mexican kids parked across the street.

15:18.805 --> 15:21.603
- They looked like gang members.
- [Dutch] What kind of car?

15:21.741 --> 15:25.177
I don't know. It was so old and beat up
with gray spray paint.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.371
I got a good look
at the driver though.

15:27.481 --> 15:29.506
Daddy! Daddy, are you okay?

15:29.616 --> 15:32.642
I'm just a little dizzy.
I'll be okay.

15:32.752 --> 15:35.550
We have to get him to a hospital.
He's got heart problems.

15:35.655 --> 15:37.782
One of our unis can drop him off
at Mission Cross.

15:37.891 --> 15:39.791
- We can do this later.
- I'll come with you.

15:46.533 --> 15:50.025
Mama, these folks
wanna talk to you.

15:50.136 --> 15:52.764
- Mama-
- Somes of bitches, eat my ass.

15:52.873 --> 15:55.671
[Monica]
Angie, come here.

15:57.444 --> 16:00.038
Do you have other family
you go to when she's like this?

16:00.146 --> 16:02.876
She's like this all the time.
Someone's gotta look out for her.

16:02.983 --> 16:06.851
- We'll get her into treatment.
- Last time I called it was a half a year wait.

16:06.953 --> 16:08.477
Me calling might
make a difference.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.613
[Mother]
Shit, stop gettin'at me, man.

16:10.724 --> 16:14.820
[Mackey] Hoda, come on. Where do
you score your herone from? Come on.

16:14.928 --> 16:17.692
- I got a sick friend.
- All right.

16:17.797 --> 16:19.788
I can take me some gray dick.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.394
Hey, hey, listen. I can't help you score
if I can't reach your main man.

16:24.504 --> 16:26.096
You have a name
and number for me?

16:26.206 --> 16:30.666
Hell, any of them houses
on the cul-de-sac got a big bag.

16:30.777 --> 16:33.575
What cul-de-sac?
Hoda? Hoda?

16:33.680 --> 16:36.410
Leave her be!

16:36.516 --> 16:39.417
Mama, you're talking about
the houses on Hoover?

16:39.519 --> 16:41.680
Used to party and play over there.

16:41.788 --> 16:44.052
You know the dead end
by the steps?

16:44.157 --> 16:48.389
I know some kids over there.
Saw Mama copping a couple times.

16:48.495 --> 16:51.225
Check this out.
House on the left.

16:54.534 --> 16:58.698
Reinforced steel doors. Blacked-out
windows. Same as the place next door.

16:58.805 --> 17:00.705
It's gotta be the house
Angie was talking about.

17:00.807 --> 17:03.742
Yeah. Uh, no smoke
or traffic.

17:03.843 --> 17:06.710
- /t ain't no rock house, but it's something big.
- Yeah.

17:06.813 --> 17:09.474
- Check out the guy over there.
- A spotter.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.983
- Another one over there.
- Homeboy's doing more...

17:12.085 --> 17:15.111
than keeping the flat screen
from getting jacked.

17:15.221 --> 17:18.884
- I think it's warrant time.
I'm gonna call my captain.
- This is my tip.

17:18.992 --> 17:22.428
You're not assigned to Farmington.

17:22.529 --> 17:25.327
Look, after we close
the book on this case and Angie-

17:25.432 --> 17:27.400
- You got Shane back in the house, man.
- And having you there...

17:27.500 --> 17:29.593
is gonna drive him further away.

17:31.438 --> 17:34.373
/ need him close,
and you know why.

17:34.474 --> 17:37.966
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look, I know you want back in.

17:40.213 --> 17:42.306
But-
[Sighs]

17:42.415 --> 17:45.248
You keep showing up at the Barn
with Juvie intel on all my cases.

17:45.352 --> 17:47.752
I appreciate it.

17:47.854 --> 17:50.914
Shane's still an issue.
There's still a lot of history there.

17:54.494 --> 17:58.055
Neighbors say they're nice people.
You know, keep to themselves.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.826
Well, there's been a bunch of home invasions
in this neighborhood.

18:00.934 --> 18:04.301
- Yeah, we answered one of those.
- Hey, take a look at this.

18:05.805 --> 18:08.569
Uh, find out if there was a car parked
across the street...

18:08.675 --> 18:11.769
with a bunch of male Hispanics
around 9:30 this morning.

18:11.878 --> 18:14.847
[Danny]
All right.

18:14.948 --> 18:17.781
Go to the trouble of killing someone,
you leave the good stuff in plain sight?

18:17.884 --> 18:19.909
Yeah, not a very thorough
home invasion.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.888
Unless the victim put up a struggle,
got herself shot. They panicked, took off.

18:23.990 --> 18:26.254
Well, / had a case,
two guys on crank...

18:26.359 --> 18:28.953
took multiple stab wounds
from an 80-year-old...

18:29.062 --> 18:31.292
whose birdbath
they were trying to swipe.

18:31.398 --> 18:35.357
Old and stubborn. Guess all you look for
is a good fight sometimes, huh?

18:39.973 --> 18:42.999
Daughter makes it sound
like a home invasion.

18:43.109 --> 18:46.010
Something off
with the family though.

18:46.112 --> 18:48.774
Neighborhood's Byz Lat turf.
You should get with the O.G.'s.

18:48.882 --> 18:50.782
Scooby and Lucas
are talking to 'em now.

18:50.884 --> 18:53.216
Ese crews run a bunch of gank-and-gos
over there lately.

18:53.319 --> 18:55.947
- Four in the last month.
- You should take a look at the witness statements.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.024
Read the reports.
Witnesses are being reinterviewed.

18:58.124 --> 19:00.024
Have you got something big
going down?

19:00.126 --> 19:03.687
Yeah. Have you run
a canvass of the area?

19:03.797 --> 19:06.265
You know, I have run
a murder investigation before.

19:06.366 --> 19:10.234
Right. And I couldn't be happier having
a seasoned law enforcement professional...

19:10.336 --> 19:13.100
such as yourself,
working the case under me.

19:13.206 --> 19:16.937
Just attack it...
like you're hungry...

19:17.043 --> 19:19.807
like the wolf.

19:19.913 --> 19:24.350
Okay, everyone, the target looks like
a drug distribution center.

19:24.451 --> 19:27.579
Two neighboring houses
that have security and communications.

19:27.687 --> 19:30.155
One of their spotters
calls himselfTek Nine...

19:30.256 --> 19:33.020
so we can assume the firepower
lives up to the name.

19:33.126 --> 19:36.095
We also want you to be aware we're looking for
a suspect in an ongoing murder investigation...

19:36.196 --> 19:38.096
who operates out of this area.

19:38.198 --> 19:40.962
Rides a motorcycle.
His street name is Freebo.

19:41.067 --> 19:44.366
High-risk warrant like this,
shouldn't we be going in at night?

19:44.471 --> 19:48.100
The bad guys have embedded themselves
in a residential area where there's a lot of kids.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.836
We hit while they're in school,
minimize the risk.

19:50.944 --> 19:54.812
The trade-off is we lose the element
of surprise, which makes our job harder.

19:54.914 --> 19:58.475
This will be a success if,
and only if...

19:58.585 --> 20:01.315
every one of you
comes back in one piece...

20:01.421 --> 20:04.413
and no civilians are hurt,
so let's do it right.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.393
All right, team assignments
and target 20.

20:08.495 --> 20:11.931
Shane, you're going in with me.
Army, with Ronnie and Lemmy's group.

20:14.334 --> 20:17.303
- Jesus Christ.
- Is this part of Antwon's operation?

20:17.403 --> 20:19.496
Yeah, this block?
It's gotta be.

20:19.606 --> 20:22.666
- This is major. We gotta give him a heads-up.
- Take it easy, all right?

20:24.377 --> 20:27.471
- [Monica] No cell phones.
- I just gotta let my wife know-

20:27.580 --> 20:30.071
- Operational security.
- Right. Okay.

20:31.184 --> 20:33.584
Shane, let's move out.

20:44.063 --> 20:45.963
- [Cell Phone Beeps]
- [Cocks Gun] I wouldn't.

20:46.065 --> 20:48.625
Drop it.
Hands behind your head.

20:59.112 --> 21:01.012
[Man]
Take it down this way.

21:04.150 --> 21:07.984
[Man]
Please step back here.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.018
- Pick up! Pick up! It's the cops, man.
- Police!

21:15.128 --> 21:17.790
Stay on the ground.
Don't move. Don't move!

21:23.970 --> 21:26.495
Let's bring it around back.
Come on.

21:26.606 --> 21:28.904
[Rap, /ndistinct]

21:33.813 --> 21:35.940
- [Mackey Yells, Indistinct]
- [Explosion]

21:36.049 --> 21:37.949
[Overlapping Yelling]

21:38.051 --> 21:40.315
Police! Stay right there!

21:40.420 --> 21:44.083
[Indistinct Yelling]

21:46.392 --> 21:48.292
Take it up.
Take it up. Police.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.591
Get away from the window.

21:53.533 --> 21:55.865
- [Rap Continues]
- On the wall. Look at the wall.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.869
- You got him?
- Yeah. Clear.

21:57.971 --> 21:59.563
- Clear.
- Clear.

21:59.672 --> 22:01.936
- Hey.
- [Grunts]

22:07.847 --> 22:11.339
- Jesus.
- I wish we had this kind of shit in Iraq.

22:12.719 --> 22:15.051
[Helicopter Flying Overhead]

22:15.154 --> 22:18.521
Holy cow. Well!

22:21.895 --> 22:23.886
What I got here...

22:23.997 --> 22:27.899
buys each of you entrepreneurs
a hard 20 in Pelican Bay.

22:28.001 --> 22:33.064
Now, I'm looking for the dealer who capped
a brother over on Seymour last night.

22:33.172 --> 22:35.640
His name's Freebo.
He drives a rice burner.

22:35.742 --> 22:39.576
[Mackey] One of you citizens gives us
a name, you walk away clean.

22:39.679 --> 22:42.580
- [Sirens Wailing /n Distance]
- [Man Yelling, /ndistinct]

22:45.752 --> 22:47.652
Up. Up.

22:52.792 --> 22:56.228
Freebo was just here.
Real name's Freddie Bokamp.

22:56.329 --> 22:59.093
Smart man.
How long ago?

22:59.198 --> 23:02.292
Half an hour, maybe.
I heard his bike.

23:02.402 --> 23:04.836
Hey, shit no, man.

23:04.938 --> 23:07.031
Take me down
with everybody else.

23:07.140 --> 23:10.132
- Feed your ear there.
- All right.

23:17.884 --> 23:21.251
Captain, we got a strong chemical odor
coming from the back of that building.

23:21.354 --> 23:24.755
- Could be ether.
- Possible meth lab. Get Hazmat down here.

23:24.857 --> 23:27.587
I got a lead on Freebo.
Frederick Bokamp.

23:27.694 --> 23:30.458
- This is his D.M.V.
- Where is he?

23:30.563 --> 23:33.430
If he didn't split before we locked this place down,
he could be in any of those buildings...

23:33.533 --> 23:35.797
but pulling a new warrant
takes time.

23:37.904 --> 23:42.739
This Hazmat situation,
I think we better evacuate the block.

23:42.842 --> 23:46.573
That's a good idea.
A crank lab, the whole place could blow.

23:46.679 --> 23:49.739
Attention, all residents.
This is a mandatory evacuation order.

23:49.849 --> 23:52.340
You must leave the premises
immediately.

23:52.452 --> 23:55.683
Again, / repeat, please leave
the premises immediately.

23:59.859 --> 24:03.260
Okay, sir, step on out.
You need to evacuate the premises.

24:03.363 --> 24:06.093
- My son's got pneumonia.
- We'll get him medical attention.

24:06.199 --> 24:09.498
You can't stay here though.

24:09.602 --> 24:12.264
- You can'tjust come in here like this.
- Come on, sir, step outside.

24:12.372 --> 24:15.398
- What the hell you doing, man?
- We'll take him to the hospital.

24:15.508 --> 24:18.341
You need to clear out of here though.
There's hazardous material in the area.

24:18.444 --> 24:21.277
- You need to clear out.
- Put him down, goddamn it!

24:21.381 --> 24:25.044
[Clamoring]

24:26.919 --> 24:29.945
That's cold.

24:30.089 --> 24:32.421
Did your mother have
any enemies that you know of?

24:32.525 --> 24:35.653
No. And she was my stepmother.

24:35.762 --> 24:39.061
My mom passed
nine years ago next month.

24:39.165 --> 24:42.931
[Chuckles]
It was like déjà vu finding Margo's body.

24:43.036 --> 24:47.632
- How's that?
- My dad and / found my mom in the same room.

24:47.740 --> 24:52.575
We'd just come back from running errands,
and she was just lying there.

24:55.148 --> 24:57.241
- [Claudette] How'd she die?
- Stroke.

24:57.350 --> 24:59.818
My dad had a heart attack
the next week.

24:59.919 --> 25:03.582
I guess that happens sometimes
when people have been together a long time.

25:03.689 --> 25:07.887
We found a jewelry box in your bedroom.
/t's beautiful pieces.

25:07.994 --> 25:10.292
Oh, yeah, my mother's.

25:10.396 --> 25:13.627
Thieves only took
your stepmother's jewelry.

25:13.733 --> 25:17.328
I just- I'm worried about my dad
having to go through this all over again.

25:17.437 --> 25:20.600
l-I really need to get back
to the hospital to be with him.

25:20.706 --> 25:23.675
We can call over there,
see how he's doing.

25:23.776 --> 25:25.744
Send a car over
ifhe's ready to go.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.077
[Murmuring]

25:31.184 --> 25:34.415
Hell of a day.
It wouldn't be a bad month.

25:34.520 --> 25:39.048
Yeah, the evacuation didn't turn up Freebo,
but I'm not done yet.

25:39.158 --> 25:42.753
Last chance for any of you cupcakes
if you ever wanna smell pussy again.

25:42.862 --> 25:45.626
/ can smell yours
from here, bitch.

25:45.731 --> 25:47.562
[Man]
Shit.

25:50.503 --> 25:52.403
You get to come with me.

25:54.373 --> 25:58.002
Easy, man.
I was, like, acting down there.

25:58.111 --> 26:00.011
You know, for the homies.

26:00.113 --> 26:02.377
Yeah, well, if you don't
tell me where Freebo is...

26:02.482 --> 26:04.848
you're gonna be acting
like a guy doing life in prison.

26:04.951 --> 26:08.079
It's hard to say.
Brother gets around on those wheels, man.

26:08.187 --> 26:11.156
- He a free spirit.
- [Men Yelling]

26:11.257 --> 26:15.284
- What you doing, man?
- I'm acting for the homies.

26:15.394 --> 26:18.761
You think they got the message,
or do we need a second act?

26:18.865 --> 26:21.390
Freebo stays with
his twin brother, Weebo.

26:23.870 --> 26:25.770
Freebo and Weebo?

26:25.872 --> 26:30.309
- Got a line on Freebo.
- [Door Buzzes]

26:30.409 --> 26:32.934
Hey, press conference
hasn't started yet.

26:33.045 --> 26:36.310
You still got plenty of time to figure out
how to take credit for all this.

26:38.251 --> 26:41.379
7661 Anholt.
That's Freebo's crib.

26:41.487 --> 26:44.251
Come back us up.
He's a shooter.

26:44.357 --> 26:47.349
An impressive bust from what I hear.
Congratulations.

26:47.460 --> 26:51.521
Why do / get the feeling that's the last
compliment /'ll get in this conversation?

26:51.631 --> 26:53.792
/ just came
from the crime scene.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.630
You've got a lot of unhappy people
out in the street.

26:56.736 --> 26:58.931
Hazmat's finishing up
a threat assessment.

26:59.038 --> 27:01.404
Why weren't arrangements made
for emergency shelter?

27:01.507 --> 27:05.534
[Sighs] We weren't anticipating
having to evacuate the area.

27:05.645 --> 27:09.012
Next time you have an operation this size,
you should let me know.

27:09.115 --> 27:11.913
I can put the resources
of my office at your disposal.

27:12.018 --> 27:14.612
Head off little snafus
like these.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.847
You say snafu, I say the biggest
drug bust in Farmington...

27:16.956 --> 27:18.856
in the last 10 years.

27:21.260 --> 27:23.660
Dutch, we're sure
the murder weapon was a.38.

27:23.763 --> 27:25.731
Pending confirmation
from Ballistics.

27:25.831 --> 27:28.129
We found a box of.38 ammo
in the husband's closet.

27:28.234 --> 27:30.327
- You find a gun?
- Turned the place upside down.

27:30.436 --> 27:32.336
Neighbors say gangs
have been a problem...

27:32.438 --> 27:34.872
but no one saw
this car full of Mexicans.

27:34.974 --> 27:36.874
Gonna take a gun
and not the ammo?

27:36.976 --> 27:38.876
Swipe the cheap jewelry,
leave the good stuff.

27:38.978 --> 27:41.538
How much convincing would it take
to move you off this home invasion scenario?

27:41.647 --> 27:43.945
I'm not loving it,
which leaves the husband and daughter.

27:44.050 --> 27:45.950
Doesn't strike me
he wanted out of the marriage.

27:46.052 --> 27:48.043
So, what was in it
for Daddy's little girl?

27:48.154 --> 27:50.520
I think you just answered
your own question.

27:51.958 --> 27:55.519
- Do you own a handgun, Warren?
- .38 Smith & Wesson. Why?

27:55.628 --> 27:58.825
[Dutch] We're looking into the possibility
it could have been the murder weapon.

27:58.931 --> 28:02.128
- Where do you keep it?
- On a shelf in the bedroom closet.

28:02.235 --> 28:06.365
But it's not loaded. / make it a point
to keep the bullets in the drawer.

28:06.472 --> 28:09.930
- So it should be in the closet there now.
- Sure.

28:10.042 --> 28:13.569
Because we've had our people go
all through the place. We can't find it.

28:13.679 --> 28:16.773
- Did Margo and Donna get along?
- Did they ever argue?

28:16.882 --> 28:19.544
They had opinions.

28:19.652 --> 28:22.746
You're telling me all the time Donna's been
taking care of you, she wasn't upset?

28:22.855 --> 28:25.756
Margo wanting you to pull up stakes,
move you to another state?

28:28.227 --> 28:32.721
Uh, excuse me.

28:32.832 --> 28:34.732
I'm having a senior moment.

28:34.834 --> 28:39.567
Um, we had another break-in...

28:39.672 --> 28:42.163
a little while back.

28:42.275 --> 28:45.403
/ didn't wanna tell Donna about it,
'cause / knew she'd worry.

28:45.511 --> 28:48.912
It's what she does best.

28:49.015 --> 28:51.813
My gun was stolen.

28:51.917 --> 28:55.375
You report the burglary
to the police?

28:55.488 --> 28:59.424
No. Uh, that was probably
a mistake, wasn't it?

29:01.494 --> 29:05.555
Captain, I need your officer
to testify in this assault case...

29:05.665 --> 29:08.691
and I am having trouble
serving his subpoena.

29:08.801 --> 29:11.463
He's on vacation.
He gets back on duty tomorrow.

29:11.570 --> 29:13.629
- I'll make sure he gets it.
- I appreciate it.

29:13.739 --> 29:16.105
Question for you.

29:16.208 --> 29:19.006
How did your office decide
to file on the Webster case?

29:19.111 --> 29:21.705
- Oh, it's still in play.
- Trying to make a plea bargain?

29:21.814 --> 29:25.875
Well, I don't know where it is exactly.
I mean, I don't have the file in front of me.

29:25.985 --> 29:29.751
Is there someone in your office
I can call to check on it?

29:29.855 --> 29:32.881
The case is in the system.
What's the urgency?

29:32.992 --> 29:34.823
We're moving to seize the property.

29:34.927 --> 29:37.919
This won't fly if it gets kicked down
to a misdemeanor.

29:39.465 --> 29:44.300
Look, I'm not at liberty
to discuss specifics right now.

29:44.403 --> 29:47.930
As soon as I know something,
I will get back to you. Thanks again.

29:50.076 --> 29:52.067
You're welcome.

29:52.211 --> 29:56.079
- You got some explaining to do.
- Hey, I was double-blind.

29:56.182 --> 29:58.082
You didn't tell me
what you had going.

29:58.184 --> 30:00.243
Mackey through this
into high gear behind my back.

30:00.353 --> 30:02.821
I didn't know it was going down
till it was too late.

30:02.922 --> 30:06.483
Hey, two rules:
Don't complain and don't explain.

30:06.592 --> 30:09.254
The only rule is that
you don't set the rules.

30:09.362 --> 30:11.853
And you need to explain
to your people that it's bad business...

30:11.964 --> 30:13.955
to whack a citizen
in front of a witness.

30:14.066 --> 30:17.467
Now there's a manhunt for your boy Freebo.
You better hope I'm the one who brings him in.

30:19.038 --> 30:21.336
I got four layers of nigs
don't even know who they work for...

30:21.440 --> 30:23.374
insulating me
from that cul-de-sac.

30:23.476 --> 30:26.070
Yeah, as long as your crew hangs tight.
One of your boys decides...

30:26.178 --> 30:28.442
to roll on one of your other boys
to get out from the murder...

30:28.547 --> 30:30.947
you got a big hole
in that insulation.

30:31.050 --> 30:33.610
I'm still the best friend you got.

30:33.719 --> 30:36.916
- I appreciate the help.
- It's what I'm here for.

30:37.022 --> 30:41.186
And if you'd start listenin', this whole thing
would go a lot easier on the both of us.

30:41.293 --> 30:43.625
You know what?
I think the two of us should get together.

30:43.729 --> 30:45.890
You know, work on
our communication skills.

30:45.998 --> 30:48.558
That way shit like this
doesn't happen again.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.567
I'll let you know when.

30:52.037 --> 30:55.097
Where the hell is Shane?

30:55.207 --> 30:57.607
[Curtis]
Which one's Weebo and which one's Freebo?

30:57.710 --> 31:00.804
- They're twins.
- Shit, they're running. Somebody tipped them off.

31:00.913 --> 31:03.404
What if they take off in different directions?
We only got one car.

31:03.516 --> 31:05.882
- Where the hell is he?
- [Motorcycle Engine Starts]

31:05.985 --> 31:09.512
- We gotta go.
- Yeah, they're splittin' up. We gotta go. Damn it!

31:10.623 --> 31:13.456
Police!
Move away from the bikes now!

31:13.559 --> 31:15.857
- Hands on your head.
- Gun!
- [Gunshots]

31:15.961 --> 31:18.930
Goddamn it. Put your hands on your head.
Get down on the ground.

31:19.031 --> 31:20.931
- Get down.
- You all right?

31:21.033 --> 31:23.160
- Yeah.
- [Woman On Phone] 911 emergency.

31:23.269 --> 31:26.727
This is Detective Lemansky.
Badge number 27228.

31:26.839 --> 31:29.364
/'ve been involved in a shooting
at 7661 Anholt.

31:29.475 --> 31:31.739
Notify paramedics
and a supervisor.

31:31.844 --> 31:33.744
- Where the hell you been?
- What happened?

31:33.846 --> 31:39.011
- Goddamn it, we needed you! You, call for backup!
- [Curtis] Look, / got this.

31:39.118 --> 31:41.245
Look what you did to my brother, man.
You goddamn pigs!

31:41.353 --> 31:43.514
- Shut up.
- Look, man, we got here as quick as we could.

31:43.622 --> 31:46.022
Nice try, Freebo.

31:49.829 --> 31:52.024
Dutch says it's breaking
different than home invasion.

31:52.131 --> 31:55.931
It looks like the daughter.
We just have to trap her.

31:56.035 --> 32:00.301
/'ve stopped the forfeiture proceedings
on the Webster case. / did some digging.

32:00.406 --> 32:03.967
Webster was on the witness list for the defense
in a separate murder trial.

32:04.076 --> 32:08.342
The D.A. had other interests
in that pot bust beyond enforcing a statute.

32:08.447 --> 32:11.507
Like ruining his credibility
on the stand.

32:11.617 --> 32:13.812
Well, it worked.
He was dropped from the witness list.

32:13.919 --> 32:16.012
The defendant pled.

32:16.121 --> 32:19.181
- You just find this out?
- You smelled horseshit.

32:19.291 --> 32:22.055
Turned out there was
a pony in the Barn.

32:22.161 --> 32:24.288
Well, I appreciate your digging.

32:24.396 --> 32:28.560
You know, what I don't get...

32:28.667 --> 32:33.263
is why did the D.A. choose
the two of you in the first place?

32:33.372 --> 32:37.672
I mean, shady tactics like this, I think you'd
be the last ones they'd trust to make it work.

32:41.881 --> 32:44.850
I guess we'll never know.

32:44.950 --> 32:48.818
As far as it goes between us,
I expect a sea change in your attitude.

32:50.823 --> 32:52.916
Can you hook Freebo into Antwon?

32:53.025 --> 32:55.721
He's a little tweaked about losing his brother.
It's twin shit.

32:55.828 --> 33:00.765
Can I pull a favor? Have you talk to I.A.D.
about this officer-involved shooting thing?

33:00.866 --> 33:02.834
Lemansky's
not under my command.

33:02.935 --> 33:05.768
You know his C.I. broke this case for us,
the whole cul-de-sac.

33:05.871 --> 33:08.465
And he had permission
from his supervisor to roll with me.

33:08.574 --> 33:12.203
Their first question
is going to be the same as mine.

33:12.311 --> 33:16.247
Murder suspect? Armed and dangerous?
Where was your backup?

33:16.348 --> 33:18.248
Shane got stuck in traffic.

33:18.350 --> 33:20.284
The brothers were taking flight.

33:20.386 --> 33:23.480
We had no way of knowing
which one was Freebo. We had to roll.

33:25.691 --> 33:28.023
Write up a report.
I'll take a look at it.

33:33.766 --> 33:37.725
- [Handcuffs Click]
- I got you for killing Romeo Barnes.

33:37.836 --> 33:39.736
If we go for special
circumstances...

33:39.838 --> 33:41.772
you'll be seeing your brother again
before you know it.

33:41.874 --> 33:45.708
Don't talk like that, man.
That boy was my heart!

33:48.213 --> 33:50.875
You give up Antwon Mitchell.

33:50.983 --> 33:54.441
That'll buy you a day pass
to /.D. your brother's body.

33:58.157 --> 34:00.318
Jesus, man,
I don't even know the cat.

34:00.426 --> 34:02.553
[Mackey]
I'm trying to keep your ass off death row.

34:02.661 --> 34:04.959
[Freebo]
If I had something, I'd give it up.

34:05.064 --> 34:06.964
[Monitor Clicks Off]

34:07.066 --> 34:10.524
[Dutch]
We, uh- We may have caught a break.

34:10.636 --> 34:15.005
We've got a suspect in custody, apprehended
for ripping off a house down the block from you.

34:15.107 --> 34:18.304
Multiple convictions for grand theft,
history of violence.

34:18.409 --> 34:20.639
- You think he's involved.
- You tell us.

34:20.746 --> 34:25.114
Is this one of the men you saw
in the car outside your house?

34:29.487 --> 34:32.946
- Yeah, that's him. He was the driver.
- Take your time.

34:33.058 --> 34:34.958
- We need to be sure.
- No, it's definitely him.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.324
- You're positive?
- A hundred percent.

34:37.429 --> 34:40.023
I remember he was wearing
that shirt.

34:40.132 --> 34:42.692
This man's a police officer.

34:45.137 --> 34:49.096
He was patrolling with his partner
when you shot your stepmother.

34:50.842 --> 34:53.505
You think that I killed Margo?

34:53.612 --> 34:56.581
You dropped your dad off at the library,
went back and shot her.

34:56.681 --> 34:58.650
- No!
- Then you picked up your dad...

34:58.751 --> 35:02.380
brought him home,
two of you discovered her body.

35:02.488 --> 35:04.718
Same choreography as when
you found your mother.

35:04.823 --> 35:08.657
See, that was the last time
you had him all to yourself.

35:08.761 --> 35:12.993
You tried to, uh, recapture that moment in time
when he needed you...

35:13.098 --> 35:15.191
when it was just the two of you
against the world.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.827
You wanna trick me into admitting
something that I did not do!

35:18.937 --> 35:22.168
We've already got your father
lying about what you did.

35:22.274 --> 35:25.334
Any more, he's gonna be
an accessory to murder after the fact.

35:26.612 --> 35:28.773
/f you confess now...

35:28.881 --> 35:31.748
we won't give him the chance
to lie himself into a jail cell.

35:34.053 --> 35:36.988
[Sighs]

35:37.089 --> 35:38.989
Oh, God.

35:43.762 --> 35:46.822
If he moved to Arizona,
he'd be dead in six months.

35:46.932 --> 35:49.162
I cook his food.
I drive him to the doctor.

35:49.268 --> 35:54.865
I make sure he has all 17 of his pills
at the right time each day.

35:54.973 --> 35:58.170
She didn't care about him.

35:58.277 --> 36:00.438
Not like-

36:00.579 --> 36:04.447
Not like my mother.
Not like me.

36:04.550 --> 36:09.146
She said that they were
going to Arizona alone.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.087
After all I've done?

36:12.191 --> 36:16.184
And she just turned her back
on me, and so l-

36:16.295 --> 36:18.388
Shot her in hers.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.065
What'd you do with the gun
and the jewelry?

36:23.168 --> 36:26.433
- I just threw it away.
- Where?

36:29.007 --> 36:32.340
If I tell you...

36:32.444 --> 36:34.776
will you let me
say good-bye to him?

36:39.818 --> 36:43.811
I'm in the can. I look over and I see two dreadlocks
hanging out of the cabinet under the sink.

36:43.922 --> 36:47.619
- This boy had to be 6'3'
- How he folded his ass into a space like yea-

36:47.726 --> 36:51.822
Living in a 6-by-9 with three other soul brothers
for a few years oughta be a cakewalk.

36:51.930 --> 36:54.455
Everyone, you have reason
to be proud.

36:54.566 --> 36:59.526
Today's raid netted the largest cash of black tar
heroin in Farmington history.

36:59.638 --> 37:02.664
[Chattering]

37:04.209 --> 37:07.406
The chief asked me
to convey his thanks.

37:07.513 --> 37:09.947
Each of you will receive a letter
of commendation from him personally.

37:10.048 --> 37:13.313
So, keep up the outstanding work.

37:13.418 --> 37:16.046
Thanks.

37:16.155 --> 37:19.090
This citizen that we took to the hospital,
what did you see?

37:19.191 --> 37:21.921
Well, the individual
was informed of the evacuation order.

37:22.027 --> 37:25.929
He responded in a belligerent manner,
was restrained by the other officers present.

37:26.031 --> 37:28.158
[Monica]
Anything to add?

37:28.267 --> 37:30.394
That's pretty much
how it went down.

37:30.502 --> 37:33.869
He isn't even out of the E.R.
He's already threatening a lawsuit.

37:33.972 --> 37:36.873
I'll make it clear to the city attorney
that his case has no merit.

37:36.975 --> 37:39.876
- Good work.
- Thanks a lot.

37:39.978 --> 37:43.880
Next time those guys are gonna party
over busting some "soul brother"...

37:43.982 --> 37:47.281
- it better be out of my earshot.
- They're blowing off steam.

37:47.386 --> 37:49.411
Everybody's just happy
to be in one piece.

37:49.521 --> 37:52.012
Why is everybody treating this
like we just won the big game?

37:52.124 --> 37:54.024
'Cause that raid was a home run.

37:54.126 --> 37:56.594
Yeah, well, I'm having a hard time
mustering team spirit over a beat down.

37:56.695 --> 38:00.096
Get real, Julien. You were there.
You saw what happened.

38:00.199 --> 38:02.793
He was minding his own business.
Until we showed up and started dragging him...

38:02.901 --> 38:04.801
and everybody else
out of their homes.

38:04.903 --> 38:07.167
If those folks were interested
in getting the thugs off the streets...

38:07.272 --> 38:09.206
instead of turning us
into the enemy-

38:09.308 --> 38:11.572
Well, why are we only
doing this in Farmington?

38:11.677 --> 38:14.544
What about Brentwood,
where the crooked drug lawyers live?

38:14.646 --> 38:16.773
And the bankers
who wash the dirty money.

38:16.882 --> 38:18.782
Why aren't we taking their houses?

38:18.884 --> 38:22.149
If you think it's such a rotten idea,
why'd you help the captain sell it on that panel?

38:26.158 --> 38:28.558
Let's go. Get up.

38:29.828 --> 38:31.728
[Man]
All right, let's get her outta here.

38:35.801 --> 38:39.567
Got the gun, missing jewelry.
Three homicides we've caught the past two weeks.

38:39.671 --> 38:41.571
Three for three.

38:41.673 --> 38:43.766
You must be thrilled
to be back in the saddle.

38:43.876 --> 38:45.969
- Aren't you?
- Wonder what changed?

38:46.078 --> 38:48.308
- What do you mean?
- I've been the D.A.'s leper for months.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.745
All of a sudden,
I'm back in his good books.

38:50.849 --> 38:53.943
You certainly did your time.
[Chuckles]

38:54.052 --> 38:57.021
These are not the type of people
to let go of a grudge.

38:57.122 --> 38:59.113
And I know I never apologized.

38:59.224 --> 39:01.351
Well, maybe they finally realized
there was no upside...

39:01.460 --> 39:03.587
in benching
their two best detectives.

39:03.695 --> 39:07.495
The buzz is that taking down
Maurice Webster gave the prosecution...

39:07.599 --> 39:10.727
- a win in some murder trial.
- Where'd you hear that?

39:10.836 --> 39:14.932
That would explain
a sudden change in attitude.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.669
That would also suggest
a quid pro quo.

39:18.777 --> 39:22.611
I gotta get with Ballistics.
Confirm this is our murder weapon.

39:24.149 --> 39:26.208
[Claudette]
Ballistics can wait.

39:26.318 --> 39:28.252
/'m busy.
And stop treating me like a suspect.

39:28.353 --> 39:30.253
Did you have a chat
with Beth Insardi?

39:30.355 --> 39:33.950
If we carried the Webster case,
maybe they'd let us out of the doghouse?

39:34.059 --> 39:37.187
Something along those lines?

39:37.296 --> 39:39.491
Fine. I confess.

39:39.598 --> 39:41.828
At least now we're getting confessions
from other people too.

39:41.934 --> 39:43.834
Real criminals. Killers.

39:43.936 --> 39:47.064
What other errands do you
have us running for the D.A.?

39:47.172 --> 39:50.539
Nothing. One of us
needs to mend fences.

39:50.642 --> 39:52.542
You went behind my back.

39:52.644 --> 39:54.942
After being ignored head-on for six months?
You bet / did.

39:55.047 --> 39:57.311
It wasn't your deal to make.

39:57.416 --> 39:59.316
You're the best partner I ever had.

39:59.418 --> 40:03.445
I hung in with you, waiting to see this through.
Instead, you just dug yourself in further.

40:03.555 --> 40:07.252
/ wasn't gonna sit on my hands and watch
you wreck your career and mine along with it.

40:07.359 --> 40:10.123
- I got dinged pretty good in this too, you know.
- This was my fight.

40:10.228 --> 40:15.029
And you lost!
So I threw in the towel with the D.A.

40:15.133 --> 40:20.799
And I'd do it again.
And if you wanna be pissed at me, fine, go ahead.

40:29.247 --> 40:31.306
You put one of my guys on ice.

40:31.416 --> 40:33.816
Then used that leverage
to turn him into your lapdog.

40:33.919 --> 40:37.116
You do not want to mess
with my people again.

40:37.222 --> 40:39.747
A new captain is in no position
to make threats.

40:39.858 --> 40:42.918
Assistant D.A. 's arejudged
by their conviction rate.

40:43.028 --> 40:46.293
How's yours gonna look when my people
show up an hour late in court?

40:46.398 --> 40:48.593
Give witnesses wiggle room
on their statements...

40:48.700 --> 40:51.430
misplace evidence,
only on your cases?

40:51.536 --> 40:54.869
Either our offices are working against
each other or working together.

40:54.973 --> 40:57.567
Which is it gonna be?

40:57.676 --> 41:00.804
- Together.
- Good.

41:04.316 --> 41:07.217
I keep hearing how good these seizures
are for the neighborhood.

41:07.319 --> 41:09.378
I can't help wondering
if they're making things worse.

41:09.488 --> 41:11.513
- Okay.
- This is where people live.

41:11.623 --> 41:14.023
They're raising their kids.
We're treating it like it's some battleground.

41:14.126 --> 41:16.959
How far is too far?

41:17.062 --> 41:18.962
Okay.

41:20.532 --> 41:22.625
So why you coming to me?

41:22.734 --> 41:25.567
To get you to weigh in
with your seniority.

41:25.670 --> 41:30.903
You have got a very popular new captain
who's got the chief's support...

41:31.009 --> 41:33.569
comin' off a big success today.

41:33.678 --> 41:38.445
Besides, my opinion doesn't seem
to mean jack shit around here.

41:38.550 --> 41:41.713
If people thought like you back in the day,
you wouldn't be here.

41:41.820 --> 41:46.655
And don't lecture me about the struggle, son.
I am the struggle.

41:48.693 --> 41:52.629
Breaking down black folks' doors
to make the world safer is not a new concept.

41:52.731 --> 41:56.565
The difference is now
you're the one with the boot on your foot.

41:56.668 --> 41:58.636
You've got an opinion.

41:58.737 --> 42:02.867
You've got a voice.
Use it or lose it.

42:06.878 --> 42:10.314
Hey. I'm getting my nuts
twisted by I.A.D. on account of you.

42:10.415 --> 42:13.213
- Oh, easy, Quickdraw-
- You, I don't know, so stay outta this.

42:13.318 --> 42:15.513
- You and I don't have shit
to talk about on any subject.
- Really?

42:15.620 --> 42:17.588
Hey, hey, easy.

42:19.458 --> 42:23.053
Unis just found Angie's mother,
dead from an overdose.

42:23.161 --> 42:25.925
- Oh, shit.
- Angie's given Social Services the slip.

42:26.031 --> 42:28.329
She's probably out there
looking for her mom, doesn't even know.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.993
- I gotta go find her.
- Hang on. I'll come with.

42:36.174 --> 42:39.575
Look, they may have grabbed your shit,
but the investigation is sealed off.

42:39.678 --> 42:42.169
No roads lead back to you.
Just say thank you, Antwon.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.738
Do you know how much
you cost me today, huh?

42:45.851 --> 42:47.819
In product and in manpower,
do you?

42:47.919 --> 42:50.012
/f you'd kept me
in the loop on your tar castle...

42:50.122 --> 42:52.818
then maybe I could have kept
an eye out for you, homey.

42:52.924 --> 42:55.620
- [Overlapping Yelling]
- Grab his piece.

42:55.727 --> 42:59.754
Grab his piece.
Gimme both their guns.

42:59.865 --> 43:02.561
[Groaning]

43:05.237 --> 43:07.535
Payback, bitch!

43:07.639 --> 43:10.506
[Groans]

43:10.609 --> 43:14.511
I don't get played,
and I ain't your homey.

43:14.613 --> 43:18.982
Oh, man, you're gonna get it.
[Groans]

43:19.084 --> 43:21.348
Shut up, bitch!

43:22.587 --> 43:26.489
You knew they were
taking down my shit today.

43:26.591 --> 43:29.151
My niggas saw you faggots
on the goddamn raid...

43:29.261 --> 43:32.753
so how you trying to tell me now
there was nothing that you could do?

43:32.864 --> 43:34.889
Huh?

43:36.535 --> 43:40.562
- You think you was ever making
the rules around here?
- [Cocks Gun]

43:40.672 --> 43:43.937
You're not stupid enough to bring
that kind of heat down on your ass.

43:49.381 --> 43:51.906
[Sobbing]

43:55.820 --> 43:57.879
I had a talk with her moms.

43:57.989 --> 44:00.617
Amazing what a bitch
will give up for a little rush.

44:00.725 --> 44:05.355
Or in this case a big rush.

44:05.463 --> 44:07.556
Jesus, you killed her mother.

44:09.334 --> 44:12.963
This is the little ho
that gave up my block.

44:13.071 --> 44:17.201
[Sobbing]

44:17.309 --> 44:19.209
She's just a kid!

44:21.146 --> 44:23.046
I know.

44:27.552 --> 44:33.013
And you two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

44:33.124 --> 44:35.058
You found her on the street.

44:37.395 --> 44:42.332
Tried to bring her in for foster care,
but she didn't wanna go.

44:42.434 --> 44:45.062
So she offered you
a mouth bribe.

44:45.170 --> 44:48.867
One thing led to another, and then
when she threatened to tell your boss-

44:48.974 --> 44:50.874
[Gunshots]

44:50.976 --> 44:54.139
[Shane]
No, don't.

44:59.551 --> 45:01.451
Give him to me.

45:01.553 --> 45:05.182
- You got rid of your problem.
- [Groans]

45:05.290 --> 45:09.317
And / got rid of mine. Now...

45:09.427 --> 45:14.922
her body shows up with bullets in it
from your two gats...

45:18.236 --> 45:22.536
and your card
in her burnt little pocket...

45:22.641 --> 45:26.702
one time, doin' time...

45:26.811 --> 45:29.473
for a long, long, time.

45:33.952 --> 45:37.251
From now on,
I say "Suck my dick"...

45:37.355 --> 45:42.258
you say, " You want me
to lick your balls, Daddy?"

45:42.360 --> 45:45.852
- [Groans]
- [Coughing]

45:50.669 --> 45:52.864
[Rock]
