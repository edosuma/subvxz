WEBVTT

00:34.509 --> 00:36.219
Hey! What the...

00:38.680 --> 00:40.056
Watch it!

00:42.976 --> 00:43.810
Come on!

00:46.729 --> 00:48.523
Hey, watch it, asshole.

00:52.277 --> 00:53.194
Hey.

00:53.278 --> 00:55.363
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

00:56.448 --> 00:58.533
Wherever I want. Now get out of my way!

00:58.616 --> 01:00.368
-Move!
-Okay, chill, man!

01:00.910 --> 01:02.245
I'm moving.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.225
I'm safe. No way he finds me up here.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.037
It's just your nerves, Tommy.
He's not here.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.079
He can't be.

01:53.797 --> 01:55.298
All right, you snooty clown.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.342
You won't take me without a fight.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.811
Speak, damn you! Say something.

02:08.144 --> 02:09.646
Say anything!

02:13.566 --> 02:16.569
Mime the gap.

02:17.779 --> 02:19.739
And, boom!

02:19.823 --> 02:21.533
Wow, look at that.

02:22.158 --> 02:23.201
My agent was right.

02:23.284 --> 02:25.453
This is it. My big break.

02:25.537 --> 02:27.956
The one that takes me
from C-list action guy

02:28.039 --> 02:29.707
to A-list action guy.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.418
Oh. Yeah. Oh, sorry.

02:32.794 --> 02:33.962
You don't even know who I am.

02:34.546 --> 02:36.339
Let me introduce myself.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.841
My name is--

02:37.924 --> 02:39.008
Cut!

02:42.887 --> 02:44.556
Nope. My name is not "Cut."

02:44.639 --> 02:47.058
But you get that. You're smart.

02:47.142 --> 02:51.604
Unlike that guy, the director,
and I use that term very loosely.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.357
He's only here because he made
a really popular shampoo commercial...

02:54.441 --> 02:56.985
...somewhere in Yugoslavia.

02:57.902 --> 03:01.781
Now, you'd think a guy like that
would be grateful for the opportunity.

03:01.865 --> 03:03.158
But no.

03:03.867 --> 03:04.868
Not this guy.

03:05.243 --> 03:06.161
And you know why?

03:06.244 --> 03:07.454
Because he's a bully,

03:07.537 --> 03:11.666
and there's nothing on this earth
I hate more than a bully.

03:11.749 --> 03:12.750
What the hell was that?

03:12.834 --> 03:14.669
-What the hell was what?
-That!

03:14.752 --> 03:16.588
The line is, "Gravity's a bitch."

03:16.671 --> 03:18.173
Not "Mime the gap"!

03:18.256 --> 03:19.674
We have to have that line.

03:19.757 --> 03:24.012
Remember, you say it at the beginning,
and then it comes into play at the end.

03:24.095 --> 03:25.221
Oh, come on, Ethan.

03:25.305 --> 03:28.600
We both know that
"gravity's a bitch" is a terrible line.

03:28.683 --> 03:29.684
You don't see the writer

03:29.768 --> 03:31.269
-raising his hand to complain.
-Uh, guys, could you...

03:31.352 --> 03:34.522
And honestly, even if he did,
he's just a writer.

03:34.606 --> 03:36.858
I can always toss a can of Blab
out the window

03:36.941 --> 03:38.818
and get another one
that will beg for a chance

03:38.902 --> 03:40.111
to rewrite this garbage.

03:40.195 --> 03:44.616
I don't need some diva
D-list action star improvising lines.

03:44.699 --> 03:46.868
I was found in the slums of Thailand,

03:46.951 --> 03:50.079
where I worked as an assassin,
killing men with only my pinky.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.750
So if you wanna keep giving me grief,

03:53.833 --> 03:56.878
then, pal, we can end this right now.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.885
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we call acting.

04:03.968 --> 04:05.011
Bam!

04:05.094 --> 04:06.471
Yeah, I... I mean,

04:06.554 --> 04:09.140
"Mime the gap" is pretty clever.

04:09.224 --> 04:11.559
After all,
filmmaking is about collaboration.

04:11.643 --> 04:15.105
We can make it work.
In fact, I love it. Great idea.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.650
Glad you came around.
Now, don't bother me.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.944
We've got one more day of shooting
before Christmas break

04:21.027 --> 04:23.446
and your star needs some "me" time.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.930
Chuck. I thought I said no orange ones.

04:49.013 --> 04:50.014
The dye will kill me.

04:50.098 --> 04:51.349
You want me to die, Chuck?

04:51.432 --> 04:53.476
No, Mr. Cage. Of course I don't.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.479
I... I would...
I'd give my life for you, sir.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.689
Oh, I bet he would.

04:57.772 --> 04:59.232
That's Chuck, my assistant.

04:59.315 --> 05:01.443
Fresh off the bus from who-knows-where.

05:01.526 --> 05:02.652
I mean, he told me,

05:02.735 --> 05:05.405
but boring info like that
just slips away, you know?

05:05.488 --> 05:06.406
Good kid.

05:06.489 --> 05:09.242
A little obsessed with yours truly.
But who isn't?

05:11.703 --> 05:13.788
All right, keep up the autographing.

05:13.872 --> 05:16.833
There are some adoring fans
desperate to see my face.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.376
Johnny! Johnny!

05:18.460 --> 05:21.796
Oh, man. We are screwed, kid.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.049
Brian Van Jones,
producer extraordinaire.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.050
Good guy.

05:26.134 --> 05:28.845
We've done a few films overseas.
Nothing you'd remember.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.973
But this movie is as much of a break
for him as it is for me.

05:33.224 --> 05:35.643
Is this about the rewrite?
Now, before you get upset,

05:35.727 --> 05:37.020
did you hear the line?

05:37.103 --> 05:38.146
You are gonna love it.

05:38.229 --> 05:41.816
I throw the guy off the train
and I'm like, "Mime"--

05:41.900 --> 05:43.860
No, Johnny, it's Jennifer.

05:43.943 --> 05:44.986
She's gone.

05:46.404 --> 05:49.240
Who's Jennifer?
Oh. My co-star, Jennifer?

05:49.324 --> 05:51.993
Yes, your co-star. The star.

05:52.076 --> 05:54.662
Well, I don't know if she's "the."

05:54.746 --> 05:56.956
Her most important scene
is slated for tomorrow,

05:57.040 --> 05:58.166
and we can't find her.

05:58.249 --> 05:59.584
What? Wait.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.045
Are you hitting the booger sugar again,
Brian? Come on.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.087
I wish.

06:03.171 --> 06:05.757
She's not answering her phone,
her assistant's disappeared.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.383
And if we can't get her
on set by tomorrow,

06:07.467 --> 06:08.718
this movie doesn't get finished.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.678
And then we're screwed.

06:10.762 --> 06:14.390
We pre-sold this movie
all over the world on her name.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.810
I've a million dollars
coming from Nigeria.

06:16.893 --> 06:18.853
Nigeria, Johnny.

06:18.937 --> 06:21.606
You know how hard that is
in a country that has three theaters?

06:21.689 --> 06:23.358
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, I mean,

06:23.441 --> 06:26.319
we know who the main draw
for this thing is, right?

06:26.402 --> 06:27.737
Yeah, she is.

06:28.404 --> 06:29.739
I don't know what we're gonna do.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.241
Without that scene...

06:31.658 --> 06:34.202
This was my big break, you know?

06:34.410 --> 06:35.537
A red one?

06:36.037 --> 06:37.789
You know red dye will kill you, right?

06:37.872 --> 06:39.541
Mr. Cage says that's the orange ones.

06:39.624 --> 06:41.876
No, orange ones are fine.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.380
Red ones will blow out your ass
and melt your stomach.

06:45.463 --> 06:46.923
Everybody knows that.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.883
-I could do--
-Brian, calm down.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.260
I'm on your side here.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.387
Now what if I head over
to Jennifer's house

06:52.470 --> 06:55.473
and show her a little
Johnny Cage charisma?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.393
Really, Johnny? You'd do that?

06:58.476 --> 07:01.104
Oh, come on, man.
There's nothing to worry about.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.897
Johnny Cage has it handled.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.150
You're a special guy, Johnny.

07:05.233 --> 07:08.862
In retrospect,
this is where everything went sideways.

07:09.571 --> 07:11.823
See my name

07:11.906 --> 07:15.660
In the bright lights I got the fame

07:15.743 --> 07:19.080
And the film lights, it's my time...

07:19.164 --> 07:22.083
I've finished sending the gifts
requested to your family and friends.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.126
Great.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.878
We're almost to the finish line, Chuck.

07:24.961 --> 07:27.505
After I convince Jennifer
to come back to the set,

07:27.589 --> 07:28.923
we can finally take a break.

07:29.007 --> 07:30.467
And by "we," I mean "me,"

07:30.550 --> 07:32.760
'cause I'll need you
to work through the holiday.

07:32.844 --> 07:35.930
It really is the most
wonderful time of the year.

07:36.014 --> 07:37.474
Indeed, sir.

07:37.557 --> 07:41.269
Though, it's strange to celebrate
Christmas without any snow.

07:41.352 --> 07:42.645
Snow?

07:42.729 --> 07:45.064
You can leave that shit
to the suckers on the East Coast.

07:45.148 --> 07:47.859
Me, I like to celebrate
Baby JC's birthday,

07:47.942 --> 07:50.612
same initials, by the way, right here

07:50.695 --> 07:52.155
in sunny SoCal.

07:52.238 --> 07:56.284
Golden sunshine,
blue skies, pretty girls.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.872
-She's still looking?
-Yeah.

08:00.955 --> 08:02.707
-Still?
-Yeah.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.000
Good.

08:05.210 --> 08:07.378
Famous

08:08.129 --> 08:10.298
I'm so famous...

08:10.799 --> 08:13.134
Mr. Cage. Can I ask you a question?

08:13.218 --> 08:14.511
Yes. My hair is real.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.721
No, I can't actually
punch through metal.

08:16.805 --> 08:19.098
And, yes, it's true
what they said about Dolly and I,

08:19.182 --> 08:20.391
but I don't like to talk about it.

08:20.475 --> 08:22.268
No. No, I... I just...

08:24.229 --> 08:26.815
I just want to know how you got so cool.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.399
Good question, Chuck.

08:28.483 --> 08:30.193
And lucky for you, we have a few minutes

08:30.276 --> 08:34.072
for me to regale you on the origins
of the Adonis you see before you.

08:34.989 --> 08:36.407
I was once like you.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.994
Truth is,
I was bullied a lot in school.

08:40.078 --> 08:40.995
You were?

08:41.079 --> 08:42.413
Yeah, I was.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.209
From Paris to Japan

08:48.586 --> 08:49.921
Let's start at the beginning.

08:54.175 --> 08:55.844
Yep, there I am.

08:55.927 --> 08:58.054
Getting my ass handed to me
in gym class.

08:59.347 --> 09:01.850
You're gonna cry, little baby?

09:01.933 --> 09:04.185
Aw, little baby's gonna cry.

09:05.937 --> 09:08.815
Well, of course I'm gonna cry,
you pizza-faced asshole.

09:08.898 --> 09:10.900
You just threw a basketball at my nose.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.365
My mom tried calling
the principal, the teachers.

09:17.449 --> 09:18.616
They all said the same thing.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.202
"Boys will be boys.
Things will get better."

09:21.286 --> 09:22.370
But they didn't.

09:22.454 --> 09:23.621
It got worse.

09:37.218 --> 09:39.846
My mom, a saint among saints.

09:39.929 --> 09:42.682
The person who always said
fighting was for Neanderthals,

09:42.765 --> 09:43.808
had had enough.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.519
She took me to the local dojo...

09:46.603 --> 09:49.189
...one of those strip mall places
you've seen a dozen times.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.359
This wasn't some sort of fly-by-night,
black-belt-for-money joint.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.528
This was the real deal.

09:56.738 --> 09:58.782
That's when I met Master Boyd.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.409
And my life changed forever.

10:15.673 --> 10:18.843
Fed by love and good desire

10:19.928 --> 10:23.097
A will of steel take you even higher

10:24.390 --> 10:27.811
Bad memories that howl my name

10:27.894 --> 10:31.773
That ember soon became a scorching flame

10:31.856 --> 10:36.027
I'm coming back to rise again

10:36.820 --> 10:40.573
I feel this will be the best of me

10:40.657 --> 10:43.201
Nothing can slow me down

10:43.284 --> 10:44.994
Or make me stop

10:45.078 --> 10:49.249
'Cause nothing can stand in my way

10:49.332 --> 10:53.419
I'm coming back to rise again

10:54.045 --> 10:58.091
I feel this will be the best of me

10:58.174 --> 11:00.552
Nothing can slow me down

11:00.635 --> 11:02.720
Or make me stop

11:02.804 --> 11:05.682
'Cause nothing can stand in my way

11:05.765 --> 11:07.809
I'm gonna rise to the top

11:07.892 --> 11:10.437
I had learned a lot
in a short time,

11:10.520 --> 11:13.690
but the greatest lesson
wasn't about how to kick or punch.

11:13.773 --> 11:14.941
It was something else.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.613
Oh, look at that.

11:20.697 --> 11:23.241
Little Johnny finally learned
how to move out of the way.

11:24.159 --> 11:26.035
Where do you think
you're going, Carlton?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.829
We're not through talking to you yet.

11:27.912 --> 11:31.124
All those people that said
being bullied is a part of life,

11:31.207 --> 11:34.419
that it'll get better,
they're full of shit.

11:34.502 --> 11:37.755
The truth is, it only gets better
when you fight back.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.605
Yeah, I got in trouble,
but it was worth it.

11:53.688 --> 11:55.482
Therein lies the lesson.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.233
Weak people bully.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.905
But the minute you push back,
they fold like a hideaway bed.

12:01.988 --> 12:04.407
After that,
I poured myself into martial arts.

12:04.491 --> 12:08.077
My master said I was special,
taught me everything he knew.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.537
But that wasn't enough.

12:09.621 --> 12:11.331
I traveled everywhere.

12:11.414 --> 12:12.749
I have so many miles now.

12:12.832 --> 12:16.169
Learning from the greatest
martial arts masters around the planet.

12:16.252 --> 12:18.254
Hapkido, kendo, savate.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.381
I pronounced all of those correctly.

12:20.465 --> 12:22.967
But eventually, all roads led here.

12:23.051 --> 12:25.220
To beautiful, sunny California.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.772
Stop! Thief! Stop him!

12:43.905 --> 12:47.283
Kid, this is your lucky day.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.704
So, Chuck, what'd you learn

12:51.788 --> 12:54.749
from that well-told
and incredibly inspirational story?

12:55.333 --> 12:57.252
It's important to develop
your inner strength

12:57.335 --> 12:58.461
to help those in need.

12:59.003 --> 13:01.089
And become a hero
to the world around you.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.632
No.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.301
Kick first, be awesome, make money.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.636
Here, I'll make it simple for you.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.389
Write this down. W-W-J-C-D.

13:09.931 --> 13:11.516
What would Johnny Cage do?

13:12.809 --> 13:14.769
What would Johnny Cage do?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.230
I just said that.

13:17.313 --> 13:20.150
You're gonna be okay, Chuck.
And we're here.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.986
Under neon lights, it's paradise

13:23.069 --> 13:24.571
And this is your time

13:24.654 --> 13:27.323
So keep on dancing

13:27.407 --> 13:30.785
Dancing through the night...

13:35.331 --> 13:37.041
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.627
I know how important
Ninja Mime is to your career.

13:39.711 --> 13:42.505
Maybe... Maybe she's left town.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.383
Just because she didn't answer,

13:45.467 --> 13:47.093
doesn't mean she's not there.

13:47.802 --> 13:49.637
I'll just hop the fence,
take a look-see.

13:49.721 --> 13:51.055
Oh! Uh...

13:51.806 --> 13:54.601
Do me a favor, Chuck.
Go down the hill and get my ride washed.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.228
Maybe I should stay
for a few minutes until--

13:57.312 --> 13:59.689
Listen, Chuck,
conversations with the ladies

13:59.773 --> 14:01.983
tend to go on longer than a few minutes.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.067
Get me?

14:04.527 --> 14:06.362
No. No, I don't.

14:08.740 --> 14:11.117
Anyway, make sure
you get the wheels done.

14:11.201 --> 14:12.285
And don't scratch it.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.745
I'm counting on you, Chuck.

14:20.877 --> 14:21.878
I got it!

14:27.801 --> 14:30.053
Oh, the things I do for fame.

14:37.852 --> 14:38.770
Jennifer!

14:50.782 --> 14:54.494
Ugh! I've seen some dumps in my time,
but, wow.

14:54.577 --> 14:56.329
You think she'd have
a little more self-respect.

14:56.412 --> 14:57.914
I mean, hire a housekeeper.

14:58.414 --> 15:00.291
Way to turn the libido down to one.

15:09.717 --> 15:11.886
Yoo-hoo! Everyone decent?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.447
We should've killed you
when we had the chance, Ashrah.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.158
Yes, Kia. You should have.

15:58.141 --> 16:00.894
Ladies. Ladies, I'm not sure
what's going on here,

16:00.977 --> 16:02.645
but I'm looking for Jennifer.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.606
Now I'd be happy to give this back if--

16:04.981 --> 16:06.775
Oh, shit!

16:10.862 --> 16:12.906
Fuck.

16:21.372 --> 16:23.333
Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.043
Okay!

16:26.211 --> 16:27.086
Sorry.

16:34.886 --> 16:36.971
Okay. Please just let me...

16:37.055 --> 16:39.098
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

16:51.736 --> 16:52.946
Whoa! Slow down.

16:55.824 --> 16:56.866
Hmm?

17:12.090 --> 17:13.091
Wow.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.597
Obviously, this is turning us both on.

17:19.681 --> 17:21.391
Can you feel that?
But I don't have time.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.768
I'm looking for Jennifer.
Do you know where she is?

17:31.734 --> 17:33.153
Get back here, Frisbee Hat.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.697
Okay, wait for me!

17:38.491 --> 17:39.492
I said, wait!

17:51.463 --> 17:52.297
Is that a...

17:52.589 --> 17:54.090
Oh, shit.

18:12.275 --> 18:14.277
I'd like to say that
I'm about to chase after them

18:14.360 --> 18:18.323
because I'm concerned about Jennifer,
and not about getting a movie finished.

18:18.406 --> 18:19.574
Ah, shit!

18:21.493 --> 18:22.911
And that's sort of true.

18:22.994 --> 18:25.163
Jennifer's well-being
is critical to the film,

18:25.246 --> 18:27.624
so, in reality,

18:27.999 --> 18:29.542
I am worried about her,

18:29.626 --> 18:33.671
which makes me less of a jerk
than we're all probably thinking I am.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.548
Fuck.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.218
Phew! Glad we got that figured out.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.429
Oh, man.
I hope I don't get blamed for this.

19:01.116 --> 19:02.117
Slow down!

19:02.200 --> 19:03.493
Stop! Please!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.703
Hey, come back here with my car!

19:13.920 --> 19:16.881
Are you kidding me, you jerk!

19:16.965 --> 19:18.091
Oh, come on.

19:22.387 --> 19:25.431
And over here
we have the home of Jennifer,

19:25.515 --> 19:27.559
world-famous actress.

19:27.642 --> 19:31.312
Oh, smells like she's having
a backyard barbecue of some sort.

19:31.396 --> 19:34.274
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private tour.

19:34.357 --> 19:36.359
I need you to follow that bike.

19:38.194 --> 19:41.114
Sir... Wait. Do I know you?

19:41.823 --> 19:45.452
Of course you do. I'm Johnny Cage,
action star extraordinaire.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.622
Action?

19:50.081 --> 19:53.626
Hmm. Yeah. Actually,
I'm really more into dramas.

19:53.710 --> 19:56.463
Yeah, well, needless to say,
I have connections.

19:56.546 --> 19:59.215
And if you catch that bike,
I'll read your script.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.550
How'd you know I'm a writer?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.969
Everyone's a writer in this town, baby.

20:03.052 --> 20:04.137
Now move!

20:23.239 --> 20:25.366
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

20:25.450 --> 20:27.827
So glad you could join us on the tour.

20:27.911 --> 20:31.748
If you look off to your left,
you'll see my good friend Tom's chateau.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.334
Yes, it's true. He does his own stunts.

20:34.417 --> 20:37.170
But it's because
he doesn't have much to live for.

20:37.253 --> 20:40.799
And over there I found out
girls really do just wanna have fun

20:40.882 --> 20:43.510
with that quirky pop star
you all know and love.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.369
Tell my sister hello.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.294
We'll find you, Ashrah.
And when we do...

21:21.631 --> 21:23.299
Ugh, freaking pigeons.

21:23.675 --> 21:24.884
There she is.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.807
All right, team, get me closer.

21:35.645 --> 21:37.480
Um, are you sure that's a good idea?

21:38.148 --> 21:40.400
I've seen my stunt doubles
do this half a dozen times.

21:40.483 --> 21:41.734
How hard could it be?

21:55.915 --> 21:57.667
Turns out, really hard.

21:58.877 --> 21:59.711
Whoa!

21:59.794 --> 22:02.380
Ahhh! Now who'll read my spec?

22:04.674 --> 22:05.675
What?

22:06.217 --> 22:07.218
I'm alive.

22:08.178 --> 22:09.721
-Chuck!
-Mr. Cage,

22:09.804 --> 22:12.891
I saw you jump on the bus,
so I thought I'd follow and--

22:12.974 --> 22:15.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't need
the play-by-play. Get me to that car.

22:15.643 --> 22:16.978
Yes, sir.

22:24.736 --> 22:25.737
Signal.

22:43.004 --> 22:44.005
Miss me?

22:45.924 --> 22:47.842
Are you always so aggressive?

22:52.639 --> 22:54.182
Okay.

22:59.604 --> 23:02.941
Just tell me where Jennifer is,
then you can have your dumb scroll.

23:03.024 --> 23:05.360
I don't know.
Now give it to me.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.531
Well, it's been real... bad.

23:09.614 --> 23:12.075
It's been really bad. Later, babe.

23:17.413 --> 23:20.792
Okay. Drive this...

23:29.467 --> 23:30.343
Great.

23:33.638 --> 23:35.723
You know, you're a real bitch.

23:36.891 --> 23:37.809
Whoa!

23:51.614 --> 23:53.116
Hey.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.827
Ladies, what do you think
about the pool?

23:55.910 --> 23:56.911
Brand new.

24:12.343 --> 24:13.344
Are you okay?

24:13.761 --> 24:15.889
Better than okay. Look what I have.

24:16.389 --> 24:17.265
What is it?

24:17.348 --> 24:18.558
No idea.

24:18.641 --> 24:21.227
But if those kung fu bitches
were willing to blow up a house

24:21.311 --> 24:24.314
and try to kill me,
it has to be important. Pull over.

24:30.862 --> 24:32.739
It's literally a star map.

24:33.323 --> 24:34.824
And what's this on the back?

24:35.825 --> 24:37.202
It looks Greek to me.

24:38.161 --> 24:40.163
You should leave the jokes to me, son.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.415
No, I'm being serious. That's Greek.

24:42.499 --> 24:44.083
You know Greek?

24:44.167 --> 24:47.170
Remember when you starred
in that film Gist of my Fist?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.421
That one producer?

24:48.505 --> 24:51.049
Well, he sent me everything
over in Greek.

24:51.132 --> 24:53.551
-I had to translate it for your lawyer.
-Huh.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.720
So, what does it say?

24:57.639 --> 24:58.640
No idea.

24:58.723 --> 25:01.601
But I have a Greek dictionary
back at home.

25:01.684 --> 25:03.103
We can go by and pick it up.

25:03.186 --> 25:06.314
Oh! Maybe you can finally
autograph my poster of--

25:06.397 --> 25:08.691
Shut up. Well, whatever it is,

25:08.775 --> 25:10.902
it's the reason
that Jennifer is missing.

25:10.985 --> 25:13.780
Which means
there's only one thing left to do.

25:14.405 --> 25:16.157
-Recast Jennifer.
-Go to the police.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.370
I mean, go to the police.
Right. Yes. That's the smart move.

25:20.453 --> 25:21.454
Come on.

25:28.419 --> 25:31.214
I've failed you, Master.
I've lost the scroll.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.258
Kia was there.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.801
And another.

25:35.593 --> 25:38.555
A most formidable warrior.

25:39.139 --> 25:40.223
Warrior?

25:40.306 --> 25:43.226
Yes. He had a strong jaw.

25:43.935 --> 25:47.605
If I were of this world,
I would say... handsome.

25:48.273 --> 25:51.776
If not for his determined spirit
and distracting smell,

25:52.360 --> 25:53.862
I would have the scroll,

25:53.945 --> 25:57.365
and the forces of darkness
would never have had a chance to escape.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.909
You still have time, Ashrah.

26:00.493 --> 26:02.620
The longest night is yet to come.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.331
I will not fail you again...

26:06.875 --> 26:07.876
Lord Raiden.

26:09.878 --> 26:10.920
I do not doubt it.

26:13.465 --> 26:14.716
And neither should you.

26:18.052 --> 26:19.137
Ashrah.

26:19.220 --> 26:22.098
What is the name of this warrior?

26:22.182 --> 26:24.768
He is called Johnny Cage.

26:24.851 --> 26:25.852
Hmm.

26:26.644 --> 26:32.442
Go. Retrieve the map and see
if you can enlist this warrior's help.

26:32.525 --> 26:34.152
But Master, I can--

26:34.235 --> 26:37.781
A cord of many strands
is not so easily broken.

26:38.573 --> 26:43.369
Besides, there may be more
to this Johnny Cage than meets the eye.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.503
Chuckie, grab that, would you?

26:52.837 --> 26:54.798
Johnny Cage's car. How can I help you?

26:55.298 --> 26:56.216
Give me that.

26:56.299 --> 26:57.842
You're in the Cage with Johnny.

26:57.926 --> 27:00.678
Johnny, it's your fucking
beloved agent, Dave.

27:00.762 --> 27:05.308
I need you to swing by
the fucking office right fucking now.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.268
Calm down, Dave. I would love to.

27:07.352 --> 27:09.729
But I'm kind of in the middle
of saving my movie.

27:09.813 --> 27:11.815
-Jennifer has gone missing--
-Johnny!

27:11.898 --> 27:15.860
I don't care if you're trying
to save a fucking orphanage

27:15.944 --> 27:18.738
from closing on fucking Christmas.

27:19.197 --> 27:22.117
I just got the biggest fucking offer

27:22.200 --> 27:23.368
of your career.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.746
...wants you

27:26.830 --> 27:29.541
for his next fucking picture.

27:29.624 --> 27:31.417
Yeah. That.

27:31.876 --> 27:33.503
Why the hell is that being bleeped?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.797
Legal? All right. Fine, fine.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.299
Everyone knows
who I'm talking about anyway, right?

27:38.383 --> 27:40.718
I mean, he did and.

27:40.802 --> 27:42.262
Shit, seriously?

27:43.012 --> 27:48.726
Okay, this... director...
has the Midas touch.

27:48.810 --> 27:52.021
One year, he'll make an adventure flick
that makes a bazillion dollars,

27:52.105 --> 27:55.608
and the next, a dramatic picture
that wins all the awards.

27:55.692 --> 27:58.695
So for now,
we'll call him "The Big Man,"

27:58.778 --> 28:00.655
so legal doesn't ride my ass.

28:00.738 --> 28:02.365
Are you all right with that, lawyers?

28:02.449 --> 28:05.410
Point is, can wait.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.036
I'll be right over.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.121
Ahhh!

28:09.914 --> 28:11.291
Heart attack, heart attack

28:11.374 --> 28:13.293
There's no going back

28:14.419 --> 28:15.503
Heart attack

28:20.216 --> 28:23.219
Mr. Cage, Mr. Doubldy is expecting you.

28:31.394 --> 28:33.313
Stay out here, kid.
I'll only be a minute.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.566
Ah! Like with Jennifer?

28:36.649 --> 28:39.819
Um, no. Weirdo.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.959
What would Johnny Cage do?

28:58.922 --> 29:00.673
Hi. My name is...

29:09.849 --> 29:12.602
My foul-mouthed agent,
David Doubldy.

29:12.685 --> 29:14.813
Or rather, David fuckin' Doubldy,

29:14.896 --> 29:16.147
as he likes to call himself.

29:16.231 --> 29:17.232
Recognize him?

29:17.315 --> 29:20.610
He's the guy from Venice Beach,
the one that had his wallet lifted.

29:20.693 --> 29:23.446
Turns out, he was
one of LA's biggest agents,

29:23.530 --> 29:26.324
and after my fancy footwork,
he took me on.

29:26.407 --> 29:28.118
He's been looking after me ever since.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.411
Fuckin' superheroes!

29:30.495 --> 29:31.830
Superheroes?

29:33.665 --> 29:35.333
Only nerds like that stuff.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.085
And the Big Man.

29:37.168 --> 29:42.841
And if the Big Man says
you're playing a turtle in a thong,

29:42.924 --> 29:48.471
you better tuck those fucking jewels
and get ready for a wedgie.

29:48.555 --> 29:50.807
I do look good in a thong.
When does it start shooting?

29:51.474 --> 29:53.017
Beginning of the year.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.395
Well, merry Christmas to me.

29:55.478 --> 29:56.646
Great. I can't wait.

29:56.729 --> 29:59.816
Don't I always take care of you, kid?

29:59.899 --> 30:03.069
Always. I mean, fucking always.

30:03.778 --> 30:04.988
One more thing.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.531
Oh, is this about the ad lib?

30:06.614 --> 30:09.159
Ugh, I can't believe
that director snitched.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.452
Okay, you tell him--

30:10.535 --> 30:14.497
No. No, it's nothing like that.

30:14.581 --> 30:15.832
Then what?

30:16.791 --> 30:20.003
I heard you were at Jennifer's earlier.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.087
How did you hear--

30:21.171 --> 30:25.341
I'm your fucking agent.
It's my job to know where you are.

30:25.425 --> 30:30.430
Thing is, there was
this, uh, piece of paper, sort of like

30:30.513 --> 30:32.265
a scroll.

30:32.348 --> 30:34.684
Yeah, we were just
about to take it to the police.

30:34.768 --> 30:36.561
David, it was crazy.

30:36.644 --> 30:38.730
There was this babe in a toga
trying to kill me.

30:38.813 --> 30:40.398
Jennifer's place was bombed.

30:40.482 --> 30:43.067
They're calling it a gas leak.

30:43.151 --> 30:45.695
A gas leak? No, Dave.

30:45.779 --> 30:47.906
Jennifer's missing.
She could be kidnapped, hurt.

30:48.406 --> 30:51.117
The scroll thing's probably
the only lead we have to finding her,

30:51.201 --> 30:54.078
so I'm going to the police and--

30:54.162 --> 30:58.082
Johnny, you don't need
to worry about Jennifer.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.751
She's fine.

30:59.834 --> 31:05.173
What I need you to worry about
is giving me the scroll.

31:05.256 --> 31:06.257
Okay?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.426
What's going on?

31:08.510 --> 31:10.345
Why do you want the scroll so much?

31:13.598 --> 31:18.394
Okay, I was going to wait on this,
but I belong to a club.

31:18.478 --> 31:21.606
Real prestigious shit.

31:21.689 --> 31:22.565
Like the Academy?

31:22.649 --> 31:25.443
Eh, less ass-kissy.

31:25.527 --> 31:29.531
This club has its fingers
everywhere in this town.

31:29.614 --> 31:34.160
You become part of this club,
you'll always have work

31:34.244 --> 31:39.916
and you'll be the superstar
you always wanted to be.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.960
Sounds great. What's the catch?

31:42.043 --> 31:47.215
No catch. We...
I want you to be part of it.

31:47.298 --> 31:51.052
We're going to have
a whole induction ceremony

31:51.136 --> 31:53.721
at the Magical Mansion tonight,

31:53.805 --> 31:56.683
and all you need to do is show up,

31:56.766 --> 32:00.895
with those expensive veneers and...

32:00.979 --> 32:04.065
give me the scroll.

32:04.149 --> 32:05.525
What about Ninja Mime?

32:05.608 --> 32:07.402
You told me, and I quote,

32:07.485 --> 32:09.446
"This movie will make you
fucking A-list."

32:09.529 --> 32:12.532
Are you fucking deaf?

32:12.615 --> 32:17.287
Stop thinking about Ninja fucking Mime

32:17.370 --> 32:21.499
and start thinking about
the Big Man's movie.

32:22.083 --> 32:25.170
Think about tights and fucking capes.

32:25.253 --> 32:29.174
I told you, Ninja Mime is already done.

32:29.257 --> 32:34.596
And if you don't give me that scroll
right fucking now,

32:34.679 --> 32:36.264
so are you.

32:36.347 --> 32:37.682
What did he say?

32:38.308 --> 32:39.517
What did you say?

32:39.976 --> 32:41.603
You heard me.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.521
I made you.

32:43.605 --> 32:49.277
Without me, you'd still be working
at fucking Blockbuster,

32:49.360 --> 32:53.573
yelling at customers about late fees.

32:53.656 --> 32:57.160
Now, quit being a big baby

32:57.243 --> 33:00.622
and give me that fucking scroll!

33:01.581 --> 33:05.919
If I was a well-adjusted man,
someone who wasn't picked on as a kid,

33:06.002 --> 33:08.254
who didn't have
a distinct problem with authority

33:08.338 --> 33:12.091
and didn't hate, hate bullies,

33:12.175 --> 33:14.427
I probably would've handled
the next bit better.

33:14.511 --> 33:17.514
You made me?

33:17.597 --> 33:20.934
Listen, asshole.
You don't do shit for me.

33:21.017 --> 33:24.104
Sitting on your ass while I'm out there
getting thrown through windows,

33:24.187 --> 33:26.606
paparazzi chasing me into the john.

33:26.689 --> 33:32.403
Ninja Mime is my best work,
and you better pray it does well.

33:32.487 --> 33:36.074
Because that's the last cent
you're ever gonna get from me.

33:36.157 --> 33:37.158
You're fired!

33:50.380 --> 33:54.008
I was hoping to do this the easy way.

33:54.592 --> 33:58.138
Give me the fucking scroll!

33:59.806 --> 34:01.474
Sure. Here.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.477
Spin kick! I call out my own moves.

34:05.145 --> 34:10.900
I don't need a gun
to take care of a bitch like you.

34:22.996 --> 34:24.038
Some more of this.

34:28.418 --> 34:29.752
Ponytails are dumb.

34:37.802 --> 34:41.723
And the award goes to... your face!

35:05.330 --> 35:07.499
You don't know what you're doing.

35:08.333 --> 35:10.001
What the hell?

35:10.084 --> 35:16.090
We fucking run this town,
and you're as good as dead.

35:18.218 --> 35:21.346
Ya hear me? Dead!

35:22.555 --> 35:26.601
Yeah?
Well, you're totally not worth 10%.

35:44.536 --> 35:47.080
Oh, oh, is...

35:47.163 --> 35:49.040
Is he... Is he...

35:49.916 --> 35:51.126
Is he dead?

35:53.586 --> 35:54.838
I'm sure he's fine.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.515
See? He's fine. Chuck, get the car.

36:21.030 --> 36:22.031
Where is Kia?

36:22.490 --> 36:26.744
She was killed.
By a member of the White Lotus.

36:28.872 --> 36:31.291
What of the scroll and the chosen one?

36:31.374 --> 36:32.375
Gone.

36:33.543 --> 36:36.254
Then I'll leave it up to you
to find him,

36:37.505 --> 36:38.506
Jataaka.

36:39.340 --> 36:42.218
Retrieve the map and the chosen one.

36:43.261 --> 36:44.262
For the Shadow.

36:45.096 --> 36:46.181
For the Shadow.

36:55.315 --> 36:56.816
So?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.818
I guess "protect and serve"
doesn't apply

36:58.902 --> 37:01.070
to celebrities on the verge of success.

37:01.154 --> 37:03.490
Something weird is going on, Chuck.

37:03.573 --> 37:05.909
We're gonna have
to figure this out ourselves.

37:06.367 --> 37:09.037
Okay. What... What do we do next?

37:09.621 --> 37:11.456
"Party like it's 1999."

37:14.083 --> 37:17.128
It's a song, by... Forget it.

37:28.431 --> 37:32.352
Magical Mansion. Invite-only.
I've never been because, well...

37:32.435 --> 37:35.605
...after the SWAT incident
with the birthday magician,

37:35.688 --> 37:39.692
I was kind of blackballed
by every so-called magician in town.

37:39.776 --> 37:40.777
Forever.

37:41.236 --> 37:43.196
Are you sure
it's okay we're using the sound van?

37:43.696 --> 37:45.198
Sound department loves me.

37:45.657 --> 37:48.618
I'm sure they're fine
with helping out the star of Ninja Mime.

37:49.202 --> 37:51.371
How goes it on the scroll front?

37:51.454 --> 37:54.124
-It goes.
-Hurry. I'm about to head in.

37:54.207 --> 37:56.417
If something goes wrong, call the army.

37:56.501 --> 37:58.795
Or better yet, call the actor's union.

37:58.878 --> 38:00.130
They're way tougher.

38:10.807 --> 38:11.808
Name?

38:11.891 --> 38:14.644
Cage. Johnny Cage.

38:15.603 --> 38:18.648
Um... I'm sorry. You aren't on the list.

38:18.731 --> 38:22.652
But, I mean, I should be. Right?

38:22.735 --> 38:25.655
Sir, the Magical Mansion
is a members-only establishment.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.825
Unless you're a member
or here as a guest,

38:28.908 --> 38:31.703
which according to my notes,
you will never be,

38:33.663 --> 38:35.623
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

38:36.916 --> 38:39.335
Oh, come on. It was an honest mistake.

38:40.044 --> 38:43.214
Wait. He's a guest of mine.

38:43.298 --> 38:45.091
I've been around
a lot of beautiful women.

38:45.592 --> 38:46.676
She might take the cake.

38:47.302 --> 38:50.346
Her legs were as long and curvy
as Mulholland Drive.

38:50.930 --> 38:52.474
And probably just as dangerous.

38:53.016 --> 38:54.350
My cousin was killed up there.

38:58.730 --> 39:00.774
Where have you been my entire life?

39:00.857 --> 39:03.359
Getting ready for you, darling.

39:04.277 --> 39:05.278
Shall we?

39:09.699 --> 39:12.744
Don't we make a fetching couple?

39:18.374 --> 39:19.334
After you.

39:45.318 --> 39:49.155
So, Mr. Cage,
what brings you to our little club?

39:49.906 --> 39:52.408
My agent told me
I should come check it out.

39:52.492 --> 39:54.119
Said he wanted me to join.

39:54.994 --> 39:56.830
And who is your agent?

39:56.913 --> 39:58.915
Shit. Walked right into that.

39:59.415 --> 40:02.335
Uh, his name is Dominic Boon.

40:02.418 --> 40:03.837
Uh, do you know him?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.839
No, I'm not familiar.

40:05.922 --> 40:08.758
And Johnny Cage with the save!

40:09.425 --> 40:12.428
But if you would like to be a member,

40:12.512 --> 40:16.432
then you deserve... a private tour.

40:17.559 --> 40:20.603
Anything you'd like to do in private
sounds good to me.

40:20.687 --> 40:22.689
Please, lead the way.

40:23.857 --> 40:24.858
So cool.

40:29.863 --> 40:31.906
Johnny? You're breaking up.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.658
Uh, is this a basement?

40:33.741 --> 40:36.119
Are we right underneath the mansion?

40:36.828 --> 40:40.999
Why, if anything happened down here,
how would the police know where to look?

40:41.082 --> 40:43.042
They wouldn't.

40:43.126 --> 40:46.796
Part of the membership grants you access
to the old subway tunnels

40:46.880 --> 40:49.174
that used to crisscross Los Angeles.

40:49.257 --> 40:50.091
Johnny, I'm...

40:50.175 --> 40:51.718
I'm trying to figure out where you are.

40:51.801 --> 40:53.178
You're breaking up.

40:53.261 --> 40:54.554
I can't... I can't hear anything.

40:56.931 --> 40:59.476
So, about this initiation.

40:59.559 --> 41:01.728
I don't have to, you know...

41:01.811 --> 41:03.313
...do something weird, do I?

41:04.439 --> 41:06.065
Define "weird."

41:06.149 --> 41:08.735
I don't know. Drink human blood?

41:09.027 --> 41:10.320
No.

41:10.945 --> 41:12.655
You don't have to drink blood.

41:13.323 --> 41:15.825
But you do need a member
to stand up for you.

41:16.785 --> 41:19.204
Which I'd be happy to do.

41:19.662 --> 41:22.499
I wonder if she'd be willing
to lay down for me too.

41:22.791 --> 41:25.585
Chica-bow-wicca-bow
wicca-bow-bow.

41:25.668 --> 41:28.546
Sorry. I even do the porn music
in my voice-overs.

41:29.589 --> 41:31.299
Come. We aren't far.

41:38.431 --> 41:40.517
Are you scared, Mr. Cage?

41:41.434 --> 41:44.854
Pfft! No,
Johnny Cage doesn't get scared.

41:44.938 --> 41:46.189
I peed myself.

41:47.273 --> 41:51.361
But you know, I'm not a big fan
of the dark or being underground.

41:51.861 --> 41:53.071
What if there's an earthquake?

41:53.154 --> 41:55.615
Maybe... maybe we should just
head back upstairs. What do you say?

41:59.536 --> 42:05.166
You don't know what glories await you
a little further ahead.

42:06.668 --> 42:08.920
Well, shit. That's not fair.

42:09.087 --> 42:10.046
Hyah!

42:10.880 --> 42:11.965
-You!
-You!

42:12.549 --> 42:13.550
Me.

42:16.344 --> 42:18.388
You need to stop hitting people.

42:25.311 --> 42:26.312
What the fuck!

42:33.486 --> 42:34.487
Come on.

42:35.822 --> 42:39.284
What was that? I mean,
she was hot, but energy beams?

42:39.367 --> 42:40.785
What the hell is going on?

42:40.869 --> 42:42.370
Her name is Jataaka.

42:42.454 --> 42:45.206
One of three assassins
from the Brotherhood of Shadow.

42:45.290 --> 42:48.793
They are intent on raising their god
in order to destroy the world.

42:48.877 --> 42:51.921
Yeah, great. Everything you just said
doesn't make sense,

42:52.005 --> 42:55.633
including the part about a woman
in something called the Brotherhood.

42:55.717 --> 42:59.012
This is all a bit much.

42:59.095 --> 43:01.222
I was just looking for my co-star, okay?

43:01.306 --> 43:04.851
Whatever weird sci-fi thing
you guys got going on down here

43:04.934 --> 43:06.936
has nothing to do with me.

43:07.020 --> 43:08.021
Agreed.

43:08.104 --> 43:10.565
But as long as you
have the scroll, Johnny Cage--

43:10.648 --> 43:11.983
Oh, you're a fan.

43:12.984 --> 43:14.194
Where is the scroll?

43:14.444 --> 43:16.279
Oh. Uh, Chuck has it.

43:16.362 --> 43:18.823
Then we must get to this Chuck.

43:28.416 --> 43:31.461
So once you get the scroll,
they'll leave me alone, right?

43:32.337 --> 43:34.255
What other purpose
would they have for you?

43:36.341 --> 43:38.009
-Chuck, you there?
-Johnny!

43:38.092 --> 43:41.971
I just called the union,
but they said something about dues owed

43:42.055 --> 43:44.015
and that they can't help you
because you're late--

43:44.098 --> 43:46.893
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Never mind.
I'm at the NOHO sign.

43:46.976 --> 43:49.104
I need you to come get me
as quick as possible.

43:58.530 --> 44:01.574
You will be punished
for your betrayal, Ashrah.

44:34.149 --> 44:36.443
-Enough!
-Oh, shit!

44:39.487 --> 44:41.823
Ashrah has decided her fate.

44:41.906 --> 44:45.452
But you, Johnny, you are special.

44:46.703 --> 44:48.621
We need you for the Brotherhood.

44:49.581 --> 44:52.500
Join us
and all your dreams will come true.

44:53.251 --> 44:55.920
Oh, no, this club sounds great.
Where do I sign?

44:56.004 --> 44:58.089
Fuck you!

45:08.391 --> 45:11.060
Two years on the job,
and he's never been late.

45:18.026 --> 45:19.027
You okay?

45:19.569 --> 45:23.364
Well, I just found out an evil cult
is trying to raise a god in Los Angeles.

45:23.448 --> 45:25.575
So all things considered, I'm all right.

45:26.326 --> 45:27.911
Oh, hi. My name is--

45:27.994 --> 45:29.370
No time for names, Chuck.

45:29.829 --> 45:31.706
Tell me you've translated the scroll.

45:31.790 --> 45:32.749
Most of it.

45:34.959 --> 45:36.336
On one side is a map.

45:36.419 --> 45:38.087
-To what?
-Los Angeles.

45:39.672 --> 45:42.592
This is the stadium,
the Tar Pits, Observatory.

45:42.675 --> 45:44.844
And if you connect the dots, it's...

45:45.762 --> 45:48.932
So, this entire city
is run by Satanists?

45:49.015 --> 45:50.183
Oh, makes sense.

45:50.266 --> 45:51.893
Not Satanists.

45:51.976 --> 45:53.686
Disciples of Shinnok.

45:53.770 --> 45:55.146
Shinnok?

45:55.230 --> 45:58.358
Quite a name. Let me guess.
The mad god you were talking about?

45:58.441 --> 46:01.986
Yes.
He is the ruler of Netherrealm,

46:02.737 --> 46:05.615
and calls for the destruction
of all things.

46:05.698 --> 46:07.742
Well, sounds pretty Satan-y to me.

46:08.409 --> 46:09.702
There. What's in the center?

46:10.787 --> 46:13.873
That's Dan's world-famous
Oriental Theater.

46:13.957 --> 46:17.502
Oh, yes. Dan's world-famous
Oriental Theater.

46:17.585 --> 46:20.130
Everybody knows that,
but I don't get it.

46:20.213 --> 46:21.840
What do they want with the theater?

46:21.923 --> 46:23.174
I mean, this Shinnok,

46:23.258 --> 46:25.593
is he looking to
put his horn prints in cement?

46:25.677 --> 46:27.887
That's where they will
open the gate to Netherrealm.

46:27.971 --> 46:29.055
She's right.

46:30.598 --> 46:34.185
The Greek on the back,
okay, it's actually a spell.

46:34.269 --> 46:36.771
It says that in order to open the gate,

46:36.855 --> 46:40.442
they need what they call...
"special" blood.

46:41.109 --> 46:44.279
Or... the blood of a god.

46:45.029 --> 46:46.614
Is that why Jennifer is missing?

46:47.073 --> 46:49.659
I mean, she's good,
but, well, I wouldn't call her a god.

46:50.452 --> 46:51.619
No matter.

46:51.703 --> 46:54.080
As long as we have the spell,
she is safe.

46:54.581 --> 46:57.625
We must retreat to our temple
and fend off any attack to--

46:57.709 --> 47:01.504
Retreat? Lady, I'm American.
I don't even know the word.

47:02.881 --> 47:06.009
I mean, I know it, but you know...
You know what I'm trying to say.

47:08.970 --> 47:10.555
Whoa!

47:13.224 --> 47:15.268
-Ew!
-Ahhh!

47:15.602 --> 47:17.187
-Did you see that?
-Yes!

47:17.270 --> 47:21.816
She just jumped out
and I spin-kicked her head off.

47:22.025 --> 47:23.902
I know.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.029
Oh, man, my therapy bill

47:26.112 --> 47:27.864
is gonna be through the roof.

47:28.239 --> 47:31.493
-You okay, Chuck?
-This violence is out of control.

47:31.910 --> 47:32.952
Tell me about it.

47:35.288 --> 47:37.123
What are you doing?

47:37.207 --> 47:40.418
Burning the paper.
No spell, no Armageddon.

47:40.502 --> 47:44.130
And if there's no chance of Armageddon,
they'll let Jennifer go.

47:44.214 --> 47:47.258
And we will be back on set
before call time.

48:02.482 --> 48:03.566
Jennifer?

48:04.025 --> 48:05.026
Hi, Johnny.

48:05.860 --> 48:07.403
Looks like you found me.

48:19.999 --> 48:22.669
Well, not the first time
I've woken up like this.

48:23.294 --> 48:25.755
Merry Christmas, sleepyhead.

48:26.339 --> 48:27.799
It's about time you woke up.

48:28.299 --> 48:31.177
Jennifer? Jennifer!
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

48:31.261 --> 48:33.513
These crazy cultists
want to sacrifice you

48:33.596 --> 48:34.973
for some demon thing.

48:35.056 --> 48:36.933
Hurry, untie me
before they get back, so--

48:38.852 --> 48:41.896
Oh, Johnny. Why would we do that?

48:44.190 --> 48:46.317
Because I've got you

48:46.401 --> 48:49.696
right where I've wanted you
the entire time.

48:52.657 --> 48:53.658
Come again?

48:54.159 --> 48:56.453
You still don't get it, do you?

48:57.412 --> 49:00.665
I'm starting to. You're bat-shit crazy.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.835
Maybe.

49:03.918 --> 49:06.296
But they say that about my god.

49:06.379 --> 49:09.132
So, I'm in good company.

49:10.133 --> 49:11.426
Jennifer, come on.

49:11.509 --> 49:14.512
You can't be throwing
your career away on some cult.

49:14.596 --> 49:18.057
This cult is why I have a career.

49:18.141 --> 49:20.769
The Brotherhood sent us here years ago,

49:20.852 --> 49:24.481
but me and some others were lost.

49:24.564 --> 49:26.608
Cut off from our realm.

49:26.691 --> 49:30.153
We've searched for decades
for a way back.

49:30.236 --> 49:33.448
But then, we found the scroll
and it showed us

49:33.531 --> 49:37.202
how to bring our god here,
to Earthrealm.

49:37.869 --> 49:40.455
We scoured the Earth for the elements.

49:40.538 --> 49:43.708
A Holy Kriss, a sacred chalice...

49:43.792 --> 49:47.670
...and the blood of someone special.

49:48.838 --> 49:54.219
You, Johnny Cage,
have the blood of gods.

49:54.302 --> 49:56.888
You're the one we've waited for.

49:56.971 --> 50:00.809
You're the key
to opening a portal for my king.

50:00.892 --> 50:03.770
Well, I'm flattered, Jennifer, but I--

50:03.853 --> 50:05.146
No.

50:05.230 --> 50:08.191
No need to call me by that name anymore.

50:08.274 --> 50:11.653
Please, call me Sareena.

50:13.905 --> 50:17.283
The only thing I'm gonna call you
is a fucking lunatic.

50:17.367 --> 50:19.744
Why don't you let me go? Now!

50:20.954 --> 50:22.789
We weren't sure
you were the one at first.

50:22.872 --> 50:26.835
It seemed impossible
that someone so stupid

50:26.918 --> 50:29.170
could be so critical to our mission.

50:29.254 --> 50:33.508
It's been fun, watching you
blindly do what we wanted.

50:33.591 --> 50:38.638
From David taking you on as a client
to being my co-star on Ninja Mime.

50:38.721 --> 50:42.767
Even when Brian tricked you
into going to my house.

50:42.851 --> 50:44.936
Brian is in on it too?

50:45.019 --> 50:46.479
Fuck Brian.

50:46.563 --> 50:48.356
Everyone is.

50:48.440 --> 50:52.527
Soon, our god will arrive,
and we will rule by his side.

50:52.610 --> 50:56.114
And all it costs is a couple
of human sacrifices here and there?

50:56.197 --> 51:01.077
Consider yourself lucky
to be part of the coming of Shinnok.

51:01.536 --> 51:03.663
Oh, yeah, real lucky.

51:06.124 --> 51:08.126
Come on, Jennifer. Don't do this!

51:08.209 --> 51:09.210
Do this?

51:09.711 --> 51:11.087
It's already done.

51:27.187 --> 51:29.230
Where are we? Where's Johnny?

51:29.314 --> 51:30.273
That hack?

51:30.356 --> 51:32.942
He's about to have
another starring role.

51:33.026 --> 51:34.486
His last, in fact.

51:37.155 --> 51:38.698
Tell me where your master is.

51:41.534 --> 51:43.453
I'm sure Shinnok
would like a word with him

51:43.536 --> 51:45.205
when he arrives in Earthrealm.

51:45.830 --> 51:46.831
Stop it!

51:51.544 --> 51:52.712
You're a strong one.

51:53.338 --> 51:54.506
But what about him?

51:55.298 --> 51:58.051
Leave him alone. He is only a boy.

51:58.134 --> 52:01.763
There was a time in which you would
have eaten this boy limb from limb.

52:02.806 --> 52:05.183
Hasn't she told you?

52:05.266 --> 52:09.354
That thing you think is human
is a demon from Netherrealm.

52:09.437 --> 52:12.023
A demon just like me.

52:16.486 --> 52:18.154
I am nothing like you.

52:18.738 --> 52:20.281
She pretends.

52:20.365 --> 52:22.283
On a quest to find redemption,

52:23.743 --> 52:25.578
which is your weakness.

52:25.662 --> 52:28.498
You can't stand
the suffering of the innocent.

52:28.581 --> 52:30.792
It's why I became a director.

52:33.711 --> 52:37.715
Now, Ashrah. Tell me, where is Raiden?

52:38.341 --> 52:39.926
You think you can intimidate me?

52:40.009 --> 52:42.554
I'm an assistant.
I get tortured for money!

52:46.891 --> 52:48.643
What would Johnny Cage do?

52:55.567 --> 52:56.568
Is he dead?

52:56.651 --> 52:57.652
Yes.

52:58.570 --> 53:04.325
Aw, man. Ninja Mime is totally
not happening now he's... Geez.

53:10.081 --> 53:11.583
Ahhh!

53:17.338 --> 53:20.425
I am impressed.
You have a warrior's heart.

53:22.552 --> 53:23.803
Mr. Cage always told me,

53:24.387 --> 53:27.849
if I get in a sticky situation,
to think about what he would do.

53:27.932 --> 53:30.351
But since I didn't have time
to exfoliate,

53:30.435 --> 53:32.479
I thought that was the next best thing.

53:32.979 --> 53:38.026
I don't know what you're saying,
but I do know he is your hero.

53:38.109 --> 53:43.823
So, Chuck Golden,
let's save your hero before he dies.

53:43.907 --> 53:47.577
Yeah. Uh, but...
Is it true what he said?

53:47.660 --> 53:49.204
You're not human?

53:49.287 --> 53:52.624
No, I am not. But I'm working on it.

54:29.452 --> 54:31.621
Brothers, sisters.

54:32.288 --> 54:35.959
It is time that we give back to our god

54:36.042 --> 54:39.045
for that which he has given to us.

54:40.255 --> 54:45.260
We, the privileged,
the wealthy, the beautiful.

54:45.718 --> 54:50.640
All given to us
so that we may live in this moment.

54:51.391 --> 54:55.728
So that we can bring about
his power on Earth.

54:56.896 --> 54:59.607
Bring in the chosen one.

55:01.234 --> 55:02.694
Get your hands off me.

55:03.236 --> 55:05.488
This is bullshit.
I don't care who you are.

55:05.572 --> 55:08.700
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna sue the pants off you.

55:08.783 --> 55:12.120
They're not wearing pants.
The robes, the stupid robes, I mean.

55:19.586 --> 55:23.631
Shadam, Shanee, Shinnok.

55:24.090 --> 55:27.886
Shadam, Shanee, Shinnok.

55:28.261 --> 55:32.140
Shadam, Shanee, Shinnok.

55:32.849 --> 55:35.852
Shadam, Shanee, Shinnok.

55:35.935 --> 55:40.940
Oh, look! The three not-so-wise ones.

55:42.942 --> 55:43.943
Gag him.

55:44.027 --> 55:45.028
Shinnok.

55:45.111 --> 55:46.571
Shadam.

55:47.489 --> 55:50.158
-Screw you!
-The spell's not working.

55:50.241 --> 55:52.285
I can tell how old you are.

55:53.036 --> 55:55.163
Shinnok. Shadam.

55:55.246 --> 55:57.499
So, what do we do?

55:57.582 --> 56:00.335
I will get closer to try to free Johnny.

56:01.044 --> 56:03.296
You must provide a distraction.

56:03.838 --> 56:04.839
A distraction?

56:06.466 --> 56:08.760
What... what type of distraction? I...

56:09.719 --> 56:10.720
Remember...

56:11.471 --> 56:13.306
What would Johnny Cage do?

56:20.438 --> 56:22.107
What would Johnny Cage do?

56:22.190 --> 56:25.443
What would Johnny Cage do?

56:38.748 --> 56:42.669
With this cut,
let the blood flow

56:42.752 --> 56:46.005
that will open a gateway for our god!

56:48.675 --> 56:50.135
Fuck you!

56:50.635 --> 56:52.303
Please make it stop!

56:53.429 --> 56:57.058
Shinnok, Shadam, Shanee.

56:57.642 --> 57:01.312
Shinnok, Shadam, Shanee,

57:01.771 --> 57:02.897
Shinnok,

57:03.314 --> 57:04.357
Shadam,

57:04.524 --> 57:05.608
Shanee.

57:07.110 --> 57:08.111
It's working.

57:08.611 --> 57:09.612
It's working.

57:10.196 --> 57:11.364
It's working!

57:13.032 --> 57:15.034
Shanee! Shinnok!

57:17.120 --> 57:19.289
Shanee! Shinnok!

57:30.884 --> 57:32.635
Don't worry, Johnny.

57:32.719 --> 57:34.304
You'll always be immortal...

57:34.971 --> 57:35.930
in the movies.

57:36.931 --> 57:37.932
Hey!

57:38.558 --> 57:39.559
Who dares?

57:39.934 --> 57:41.394
Chuck?

57:41.478 --> 57:43.730
My name is Chuck Golden,

57:44.439 --> 57:46.858
and I'm the best damn assistant in town.

57:53.698 --> 57:56.159
Ow!

57:57.577 --> 57:59.162
Oh, fuck.

58:04.834 --> 58:06.044
Sorry, Mr. Cage.

58:10.089 --> 58:13.092
Yes. Sorry, Mr. Cage.

58:13.176 --> 58:16.346
No one is coming to save you now.

58:16.429 --> 58:17.597
I wouldn't say that.

58:17.680 --> 58:18.723
What?

58:19.349 --> 58:21.643
I said, I wouldn't say that.

58:24.479 --> 58:26.272
What are you saying?

58:26.356 --> 58:28.608
I said, "Go fuck yourself."

58:49.212 --> 58:51.631
Oh, come on!

58:57.011 --> 58:59.055
It's too late, sister.

58:59.139 --> 59:00.974
The Gateway is opening.

59:04.144 --> 59:05.353
Sister?

59:05.437 --> 59:07.397
You're telling me you're a...

59:07.981 --> 59:09.816
A demon, yes.

59:10.733 --> 59:11.734
Oh, that's hot.

59:36.676 --> 59:39.095
No! No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:00:36.528 --> 01:00:37.821
Sareena.

01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:41.032
I thought you were lost to us.

01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:43.368
I was.

01:00:44.035 --> 01:00:46.788
But now, I am found.

01:00:47.497 --> 01:00:48.581
Indeed.

01:00:49.999 --> 01:00:52.585
Where have you brought me, my child?

01:00:52.669 --> 01:00:54.921
The jewel of all places.

01:00:55.588 --> 01:00:58.174
Earthrealm, my Majesty.

01:00:58.258 --> 01:00:59.801
Earthrealm.

01:01:03.513 --> 01:01:07.851
I have longed to feast
on the bones of its denizens.

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:10.478
You have done well, my child.

01:01:11.646 --> 01:01:14.607
And for that, you will be rewarded.

01:01:15.692 --> 01:01:16.776
It's over.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.361
He's won.

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.196
He hasn't won shit, not yet.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.116
He is a god, and we are--

01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:25.910
Earth's best chance of survival.

01:01:25.994 --> 01:01:27.120
Listen, Ashrah.

01:01:27.203 --> 01:01:30.665
That guy is just another
in a long line of bullies,

01:01:30.748 --> 01:01:32.917
and the minute you push back
against a bully...

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:34.669
They fold like a hideaway bed.

01:01:35.879 --> 01:01:36.880
Always.

01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:38.673
You wanna be human?

01:01:38.756 --> 01:01:42.594
Well, never giving up
is part of our DNA, okay?

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:46.097
That and male-pattern baldness.
Thank God I didn't get that.

01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:47.390
Now think.

01:01:47.474 --> 01:01:50.393
There has to be some way
to get rid of this guy.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.061
I don't know.

01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:53.229
I might.

01:01:53.313 --> 01:01:54.981
If we can get him back to the rift,

01:01:55.064 --> 01:01:56.566
and I can say the spell,

01:01:56.649 --> 01:01:59.611
it should close,
trapping him wherever that leads.

01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:02.238
Nah, that's a stupid idea.

01:02:02.322 --> 01:02:03.823
I'm kidding. That's terrific.

01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:06.868
Okay, Ashrah, can you get the scroll?

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.333
Yes. And what about you?

01:02:13.416 --> 01:02:15.877
I'm gonna do
what action stars always do.

01:02:16.419 --> 01:02:19.339
Get a huge trailer and save the day.

01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:22.675
Earthrealm.

01:02:23.301 --> 01:02:24.344
Finally.

01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:27.639
I have come to mete out
your destruction.

01:02:28.306 --> 01:02:29.599
Bow before me.

01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:32.644
Celebrate my arrival.

01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:36.022
Hey, even whiter David Bowie!

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.776
There's only one god
we're celebrating today,

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:41.569
and it sure as hell ain't you.

01:02:51.287 --> 01:02:53.039
Oh, shit.

01:03:10.932 --> 01:03:12.475
-What happened?
-You all right, buddy?

01:03:21.359 --> 01:03:23.153
People of Earthrealm.

01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:27.824
I, Shinnok, your new god, am here...

01:03:29.617 --> 01:03:30.869
to destroy you.

01:03:36.082 --> 01:03:37.083
Sorry about that.

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:39.419
I don't mind.

01:03:40.128 --> 01:03:41.129
Neither do I.

01:03:42.797 --> 01:03:43.840
All right, ugly.

01:03:43.923 --> 01:03:46.259
Time to show you
how rough this town can get.

01:03:57.896 --> 01:04:00.607
Hey, man.
I think that just pissed it off.

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:01.691
Oh, ya think?

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:14.996
Chuck!

01:04:17.165 --> 01:04:18.166
The scroll!

01:04:21.044 --> 01:04:22.337
Give me the scroll, boy.

01:04:27.258 --> 01:04:31.513
I'll admit, it is not looking
great for the Ninja Mime sequel.

01:04:41.106 --> 01:04:43.108
Oh, I feel like you look.

01:04:43.858 --> 01:04:46.444
But, hey, at least we're alive, right?

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.241
Don't answer that.

01:05:12.095 --> 01:05:13.138
What was that?

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.686
Come on, Chuck. Come out.

01:05:20.311 --> 01:05:21.312
Join us.

01:05:22.021 --> 01:05:25.525
I know you really just wanna be
a star like Johnny.

01:05:26.234 --> 01:05:28.736
I can make that happen.
Just give me the scroll.

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:33.450
I lied.

01:05:34.284 --> 01:05:35.618
I'm gonna kill you.

01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:37.454
Slowly.

01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:41.875
Now, give me the scroll.

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:43.877
Sure.

01:05:53.428 --> 01:05:55.221
Ah! I have it.

01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:57.515
Huh?

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.530
Your quest to become human
has made you weak.

01:06:12.614 --> 01:06:15.325
There is nothing you can do
to defeat me.

01:06:16.117 --> 01:06:18.161
I wouldn't say "nothing."

01:06:22.457 --> 01:06:26.628
You call them weak because they dream.
They care.

01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:28.213
They never give up.

01:06:28.296 --> 01:06:30.340
That is not weakness, sister.

01:06:30.423 --> 01:06:33.635
That is their strength. My strength.

01:06:33.718 --> 01:06:37.138
Come, let me show you.

01:06:48.483 --> 01:06:53.404
Unlike you, I am at home in my form.

01:06:53.488 --> 01:07:00.411
I do not need to disguise myself
any further!

01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:22.851
Your feeble attempt to stop me
is amusing.

01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:26.729
But I must be
about the end of the world.

01:07:35.738 --> 01:07:36.990
Come, demons.

01:07:38.992 --> 01:07:41.244
Come and eat your fill.

01:08:00.513 --> 01:08:03.516
Goodbye, Sister.

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:05.685
Ashrah!

01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:26.873
Goodbye.

01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:32.128
Thank you, Chuck.
Now we must go help Johnny.

01:08:32.212 --> 01:08:34.881
We might have bigger problems than that.

01:08:39.803 --> 01:08:43.097
Mr... Mr. Cage? Mr. Cage!

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:45.850
Mr. Cage, you have to get up.

01:08:45.934 --> 01:08:48.603
This is the part of the movie
where you make your comeback.

01:08:48.686 --> 01:08:50.438
He thinks
I'm something I'm not.

01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:52.440
Some sort of hero,

01:08:52.524 --> 01:08:55.485
rather than a guy who can kick high,
hit his mark and...

01:08:55.568 --> 01:08:57.737
look spectacular all the time.

01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:00.573
Well, kid, you're out of luck.

01:09:01.449 --> 01:09:03.493
Johnny Cage isn't a hero.

01:09:04.327 --> 01:09:07.080
He's nobody... special.

01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:09.165
You're special, Johnny.

01:09:09.833 --> 01:09:11.126
You are special.

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:12.877
You're a special guy, Johnny.

01:09:13.211 --> 01:09:14.796
"Special" blood.

01:09:14.879 --> 01:09:16.548
The blood of gods.

01:09:17.298 --> 01:09:20.468
They're right.
They were all right.

01:09:21.719 --> 01:09:23.721
I am special.

01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.974
And I'm gonna do what I've always done.

01:09:26.891 --> 01:09:30.270
Shove my special foot
down this bully's throat.

01:09:30.353 --> 01:09:32.647
I'm the last man standing...

01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:34.774
Hey, pal!

01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:38.820
This is the city of angels.
No devils allowed.

01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:47.912
It's a wonder that I'm still alive

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.419
I'm a survivor...

01:09:56.045 --> 01:09:58.506
Come on, man. Is that all you got?

01:10:01.676 --> 01:10:03.595
I'm a survivor

01:10:06.764 --> 01:10:07.974
Well, look at that.

01:10:08.057 --> 01:10:10.185
Even demons have balls.

01:10:11.895 --> 01:10:13.480
Fuck him up, Johnny!

01:10:13.563 --> 01:10:15.815
Challenge before me, yeah

01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:18.485
Johnny! Johnny!

01:10:18.568 --> 01:10:21.488
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!

01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:23.948
Am I getting a slow clap?

01:10:25.325 --> 01:10:26.993
I'm getting a slow clap.

01:10:27.076 --> 01:10:28.328
Johnny! Johnny!

01:10:28.411 --> 01:10:29.954
Kick his ass, Cage!

01:10:32.957 --> 01:10:34.709
Johnny! Johnny!

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:37.796
Yeah!

01:10:40.882 --> 01:10:42.008
Impossible.

01:10:52.018 --> 01:10:53.103
Get him, Johnny!

01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:56.022
Yeah!

01:11:06.783 --> 01:11:07.867
Eat it!

01:11:09.953 --> 01:11:12.664
You fool! You may have power,

01:11:13.206 --> 01:11:14.624
but I am a god.

01:11:20.421 --> 01:11:21.840
There! No, there!

01:11:28.012 --> 01:11:29.681
They're coming out too fast!

01:11:38.231 --> 01:11:41.151
I will enjoy eating your bones.

01:11:50.743 --> 01:11:52.328
Hey! Leave him alone.

01:11:52.996 --> 01:11:54.873
-Yeah.
-Come on, leave him alone.

01:12:04.048 --> 01:12:07.218
Any last words, Earthrealmer?

01:12:10.388 --> 01:12:12.056
Yeah, if I might.

01:12:32.202 --> 01:12:33.745
Gravity's a bitch.

01:12:53.556 --> 01:12:54.724
Chuck, now!

01:12:55.475 --> 01:12:57.977
Close this door, forevermore!

01:12:58.061 --> 01:13:01.064
Close this door, forevermore!

01:13:39.144 --> 01:13:40.395
Better safe than sorry.

01:13:49.946 --> 01:13:51.030
Chuck, you did it.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:54.075
You're the best damn assistant there is.

01:13:54.159 --> 01:13:56.911
No. We did it, Mr. Cage.

01:13:56.995 --> 01:14:00.540
A cord of many strands
is not easily broken.

01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:12.677
Well, would you look at that?

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.263
You got your white Christmas
after all, Chuck.

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.516
And you... You were incredible.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.894
As were you, Johnny Cage.

01:14:21.603 --> 01:14:24.647
You have shown me
what it truly means to be human.

01:14:25.607 --> 01:14:29.360
If I had not made my vows,
I would take you as a mate.

01:14:29.444 --> 01:14:31.905
Well, we can work on that later.

01:14:32.614 --> 01:14:33.656
But for now...

01:14:35.116 --> 01:14:36.117
You know what?

01:14:36.576 --> 01:14:38.578
When you save the world from a dark god,

01:14:38.661 --> 01:14:40.914
you don't have to kiss
the kick-ass demon fighter.

01:14:40.997 --> 01:14:43.708
But for me... I kind of do.

01:14:44.626 --> 01:14:46.836
Chuck followed in my footsteps.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.881
He took the "what would Johnny Cage do"
to the extreme

01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:52.926
and signed up for some
martial arts lessons at a strip mall.

01:14:53.384 --> 01:14:55.595
This wasn't a good one.

01:14:55.678 --> 01:14:59.140
Eventually, he put on this funny suit
with all these glowing balls

01:14:59.224 --> 01:15:01.810
and became my double
on a bunch of video games.

01:15:01.893 --> 01:15:04.312
He called himself "Mokap."

01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:06.064
Didn't make any sense to me.

01:15:06.147 --> 01:15:10.318
And the games, well, they were banned
due to excessive violence.

01:15:11.486 --> 01:15:12.946
-Come here.
-Toasty!

01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:14.572
Ashrah took off.

01:15:15.323 --> 01:15:18.576
She said she had to continue
her quest to become holy.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.079
Being by my side
made that a little harder.

01:15:21.162 --> 01:15:22.497
Can't say I blame her.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.874
I can hardly control myself around me.

01:15:25.708 --> 01:15:26.751
And me?

01:15:26.835 --> 01:15:30.797
Well, we made Ninja Mime and a sequel.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.215
And another one after that.

01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:35.677
In fact, my career was going
pretty great there for a while.

01:15:36.386 --> 01:15:38.221
But with every hill,
there's always a valley.

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.431
That's life.

01:15:40.974 --> 01:15:42.308
The biggest bully of all.

01:16:02.537 --> 01:16:05.081
Oh, Johnny Cage. Johnny Cage.
Where are you headed?

01:16:05.165 --> 01:16:07.750
Off to shoot a new film
on some remote island.

01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:09.586
Beautiful scenery, beautiful babes.

01:16:10.128 --> 01:16:12.130
I have a good feeling about this one.

01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:13.506
Is this your comeback?

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.175
Comeback?

01:16:15.675 --> 01:16:16.676
Lady...

01:16:16.759 --> 01:16:18.011
I've never left.

01:16:32.442 --> 01:16:35.320
I'm the last man standing

01:16:35.403 --> 01:16:36.988
Walking through the night

01:16:37.739 --> 01:16:41.075
Basking in the power and glory

01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:44.162
Competitors bested

01:16:44.579 --> 01:16:45.914
Challenges met

01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:51.169
It's a wonder that I'm still alive

01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:57.967
I'm a survivor

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:02.472
When it's down to the wire

01:17:04.057 --> 01:17:07.602
I'm a survivor

01:17:09.729 --> 01:17:12.190
Believe it when I tell you

01:17:12.273 --> 01:17:13.983
I am but a man

01:17:14.651 --> 01:17:18.196
Rising to the challenge before me, yeah

01:17:19.114 --> 01:17:21.074
No chance of stopping

01:17:21.157 --> 01:17:22.909
Get out of my way

01:17:23.785 --> 01:17:28.123
Throwing all my fears aside

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.838
I'm a survivor

01:17:35.964 --> 01:17:39.551
Yeah, my will is on fire

01:17:41.177 --> 01:17:44.347
I'm a survivor

01:18:47.744 --> 01:18:51.206
My will is on fire

01:18:52.665 --> 01:18:55.627
I'm a survivor

01:18:56.961 --> 01:19:00.381
You fuel my desire

01:19:01.591 --> 01:19:04.844
And I'm a survivor

01:19:05.929 --> 01:19:09.682
Yeah, my will is on fire

01:19:11.101 --> 01:19:14.521
I'm a survivor

01:19:15.188 --> 01:19:18.942
When it's down to the wire

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.780
I'm a survivor

01:19:25.156 --> 01:19:28.076
I'm a survivor

01:19:29.577 --> 01:19:33.081
I'm a survivor
