01:55.575 --> 01:59.145
"Madison, Delaware." Wow.

01:59.178 --> 02:01.447
Mom, are you positive there
weren't any other places

02:01.481 --> 02:02.849
looking for vice principals?

02:02.882 --> 02:04.317
Mmm. Like where?

02:04.350 --> 02:05.685
Guantanamo Bay?

02:05.718 --> 02:07.286
Ooh, too hot.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.721
- North Korea?
- No.

02:08.755 --> 02:10.323
They didn't call me back.

02:11.858 --> 02:13.192
Detroit?

02:44.524 --> 02:45.892
This is it.

02:45.925 --> 02:49.195
Come on, come on.

02:51.531 --> 02:52.732
Look. A yard.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.434
You'd never get this
in New York.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.436
Mom, you don't have to keep
selling me on this place.

02:56.469 --> 02:59.305
- I'm staying because I love you.
- Aw, I love you too.

02:59.338 --> 03:00.773
And I looked into it.

03:00.807 --> 03:03.743
Legally, I can't live
on my own until I'm 18.

03:34.307 --> 03:35.708
Look at this kitchen.

03:35.741 --> 03:37.510
It's bigger than our apartment.

03:37.543 --> 03:39.178
We don't cook.

03:39.212 --> 03:40.713
Well, look at all
this counter space

03:40.746 --> 03:43.649
to put the takeout on.
Whew.

03:43.683 --> 03:45.518
Do you hear that?

03:45.551 --> 03:47.286
No, I don't hear anything.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.188
Exactly.

03:49.222 --> 03:50.823
Live from New York,

03:50.857 --> 03:52.191
it's my sister Gale!

03:52.225 --> 03:53.960
With special guest,
my nephew Zach.

03:53.993 --> 03:56.262
- Get in here with a hug!
- Hey. Oh.

03:56.295 --> 03:57.597
Oh, it's an SNL reference.

03:57.630 --> 03:58.870
- Oh, yeah.
- You lived in New York.

03:58.898 --> 04:00.500
- Okay, yeah.
- Oh, my goodness!

04:00.533 --> 04:01.701
Look at you!

04:01.734 --> 04:03.503
You're not in any color.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.238
- Hey.
- We should change that.

04:05.271 --> 04:06.839
Oh, my God.
It's good to see you.

04:06.873 --> 04:08.608
- Wow, you too.
- Okay. Let me take him in.

04:08.641 --> 04:12.245
Oh, my gosh. He gets more
handsome every time I see him.

04:12.278 --> 04:14.413
- So good-looking.
- Thank you, Aunt Lorraine.

04:14.447 --> 04:16.249
He's just a beautiful boy.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.216
And Thank God, because
you were such an ugly baby.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.685
- There it is.
- Oh, Lorraine.

04:19.719 --> 04:21.220
What? It's fine.
He's handsome now.

04:21.254 --> 04:22.989
It's not like
he's gonna go ugly,

04:23.022 --> 04:25.525
handsome and then
back to ugly.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.860
No. The danger's past.

04:27.894 --> 04:29.395
Oh, I almost forgot.

04:29.428 --> 04:31.397
I got a present for you,
because I'm a cool aunt.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.399
This is from my new
signature men's line.

04:33.432 --> 04:35.334
- Ooh.
- Check it out.

04:35.368 --> 04:36.903
Awesome.

04:36.936 --> 04:38.871
It's limited edition,
so you're not gonna see

04:38.905 --> 04:40.606
a lot of men
wearing that hat.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.909
Yeah, no, I can't imagine
anyone would be wearing it.

04:42.942 --> 04:44.777
It's so limited edition.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.379
Try it on.
Make sure it fits.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.713
- Try it on right now? Okay.
- Oh, Yeah.

04:47.747 --> 04:50.583
Yeah, take her for a spin.
Vroom, vroom, vroom. vroom.

04:50.616 --> 04:52.018
Aww!

04:52.051 --> 04:54.921
- Oh, yes. Look at that.
- I mean, come on. That is it.

04:54.954 --> 04:56.522
Okay.

04:56.556 --> 05:00.259
Um, I'm gonna go unload some
boxes now, and see you around.

05:00.293 --> 05:02.595
Oh, honey. Leave the hat on.
I don't want you to burn.

05:02.628 --> 05:04.830
Mmm. And you look good with it on.

05:04.864 --> 05:06.499
Thank you. Cool.

05:21.747 --> 05:23.916
Smooth.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.892
So you're the new neighbor?

05:32.925 --> 05:34.927
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

05:34.961 --> 05:37.363
How long was the drive
from New York?

05:38.497 --> 05:39.799
No. I can just tell

05:39.832 --> 05:42.335
by the pretty hat
that you have.

05:42.368 --> 05:44.403
Oh, no. This... No.

05:44.437 --> 05:47.473
This is... This is actually
a gift from my aunt.

05:47.506 --> 05:48.908
It's also a gift for me

05:48.941 --> 05:51.510
and everyone who gets
to see you wearing it.

05:54.413 --> 05:56.916
- I'm Zach, by the way.
- I'm Hannah.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.551
Hannah.

05:58.584 --> 06:01.320
I gotta go.

06:01.354 --> 06:03.322
Good talk.

06:04.991 --> 06:07.927
Hi. Hey, we're just moving in.

06:09.562 --> 06:11.998
Just... Just me and my mom.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.836
- This hat was a gift.
- You see that fence?

06:18.904 --> 06:21.841
Do you see the fence?

06:21.874 --> 06:23.576
Uh, yes.

06:23.609 --> 06:25.711
Stay on your side of it.

06:25.745 --> 06:28.914
You stay away from my daughter,
you stay away from me...

06:30.016 --> 06:32.885
and we won't have
a problem.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.724
Well, just met our neighbor.

06:38.758 --> 06:39.859
He's a big teddy bear.

06:39.892 --> 06:41.127
Oh, Mr. Shivers?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.462
Yeah. He moved to town
a few years ago.

06:43.496 --> 06:44.664
Very mysterious.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.732
Very sexy.
I love his scent.

06:46.766 --> 06:50.036
It's like mint and BO.
It works.

06:50.069 --> 06:51.737
Yeah. Not my type.

06:52.905 --> 06:56.075
I remember that day.

06:56.108 --> 06:58.010
Oh.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.515
You okay, sweetheart?

07:03.883 --> 07:06.585
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Um...

07:06.619 --> 07:08.754
I'm gonna go get a head start
decorating my room.

07:08.788 --> 07:10.890
Knock it off
my bucket list.

07:15.695 --> 07:17.063
How's he doing?

07:17.096 --> 07:19.699
Oh, it's been hard.

07:19.732 --> 07:22.868
He's putting up a wall.

07:22.902 --> 07:25.905
Hopefully, a change of
scenery will help.

07:25.938 --> 07:28.074
How are you doing?

07:28.107 --> 07:32.678
Hopefully, a change of
scenery will help.

07:32.712 --> 07:35.514
All right, Zach. Let's see what you got.

07:35.548 --> 07:38.050
With the fastball.
Two's a curve.

07:38.084 --> 07:40.086
Gotta get up.
You gotta give me the sign.

07:40.119 --> 07:42.788
There you go. Oh!

07:42.822 --> 07:44.023
That's...

07:44.056 --> 07:45.191
Oh, see?
Dad's not perfect.

07:45.224 --> 07:47.126
No.

07:47.159 --> 07:49.128
Dad can get one drop.

07:49.161 --> 07:50.963
All right.
Read the signs.

07:50.996 --> 07:53.866
It's all just to block.
Don't wanna jump up.

07:53.899 --> 07:55.735
That's how the fastballs get by.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.537
All right. Get ready.
Go fast now. Okay?

07:58.571 --> 08:00.473
Honey? You okay?

08:00.506 --> 08:02.942
Um, yeah. Just found
some old baby pictures.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.611
I really did look like
baby Gollum.

08:09.849 --> 08:11.083
Yeah, yeah.

08:11.117 --> 08:13.719
That's always the case, right?

08:13.753 --> 08:15.788
- Hey, Becca.
- Oh, hey.

08:25.264 --> 08:29.535
Yay. New friends,
new friends, new friends.

08:29.568 --> 08:32.238
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you think you're doing?

08:32.270 --> 08:35.073
I'm going to work.
Gonna do some educating.

08:35.107 --> 08:37.710
Some administrating.

08:37.743 --> 08:40.246
Cool. Mom, I'm the new kid,

08:40.279 --> 08:42.581
which presents
its own set of obstacles.

08:42.615 --> 08:47.186
Not sure walking in with
the vice principal is the play.

08:47.219 --> 08:49.688
Just give me a 60-second
head start

08:49.722 --> 08:51.991
so I at least have a chance.

08:52.024 --> 08:54.260
Deal. You promise
you'll give it a shot?

08:54.293 --> 08:57.496
You know I can't
promise you that.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.770
I promise. All right?

09:04.804 --> 09:06.272
And this door-locking thing...

09:06.305 --> 09:08.541
Come on, you're better
than that.

09:08.574 --> 09:13.646
Sixty seconds start now,
60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54...

09:24.757 --> 09:28.761
All right. Let's find our seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.896
Find our seats quickly.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.599
Let's find our seats.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.535
Mm-hm.

09:36.569 --> 09:39.271
- Okay. Let's settle down.
- Um...

09:39.305 --> 09:42.808
Okay. Uh, sorry.
Excuse me. Let me just...

09:42.842 --> 09:45.544
Okay, cool. Okay.

09:46.779 --> 09:48.247
So you're the new kid.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.882
- Oh, yeah.
- Cool, cool.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.951
Oh. Hi, Taylor.

09:51.984 --> 09:55.054
Hi, Chump.

09:55.087 --> 09:57.323
- Did she just call you "Chump"?
- Yes, indeed, she did.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.325
My real name is Champ,
you know.

09:59.358 --> 10:01.026
But she's never
talked to me before,

10:01.060 --> 10:02.328
so we're making progress.

10:02.361 --> 10:06.832
Three. Two, one.

10:06.866 --> 10:08.033
Settle down.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.235
Good morning.

10:09.268 --> 10:12.805
I am so happy
to introduce you

10:12.838 --> 10:15.007
to our new vice principal,
Miss Cooper.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.976
And I hope that you show her

10:17.009 --> 10:19.211
the same respect
that you show me.

10:21.113 --> 10:24.316
Who did that? Who did that?

10:26.051 --> 10:28.087
Miss Cooper.

10:34.693 --> 10:35.828
Hi, everyone.

10:35.861 --> 10:38.764
I know I speak
for the entire administration

10:38.797 --> 10:42.701
when I say that we are so
excited for Friday's fall dance.

10:42.735 --> 10:45.170
We can't stop
twerking about it.

10:46.772 --> 10:47.907
Oh, no, she didn't.

10:50.276 --> 10:51.977
Oh, She's worse
than the last one.

10:52.011 --> 10:53.212
That's my mom.

10:53.245 --> 10:56.248
Oh, well, the last one
was fantastic.

10:56.282 --> 10:59.018
I... I'm kidding. I don't even
know what twerking is.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.252
But I hear it's very popular...

11:00.286 --> 11:02.988
So you taking anyone
to the dance?

11:03.022 --> 11:04.723
- No.
- Yeah.

11:04.757 --> 11:07.359
I was thinking
about flying solo too.

11:07.393 --> 11:09.862
Hey, we should go
together.

11:09.895 --> 11:10.996
Together?

11:11.030 --> 11:13.699
Oh, not like "together"
together.

11:13.732 --> 11:16.869
Dance together or anything.
Although that could work.

11:16.902 --> 11:18.871
You know, we get the crowd
into it, you know?

11:18.904 --> 11:20.973
And then go split off
with different girls.

11:21.006 --> 11:24.310
And as a final reminder,
just be safe and have fun.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.749
Take this. You know,
Shoot me a text or tweet me.

11:30.783 --> 11:32.718
It has all my contact info.

11:32.751 --> 11:35.154
There's my home address,
and that's my locker number.

11:35.187 --> 11:37.156
- You know where to find me. Alright.
- Anyone.

11:37.189 --> 11:38.657
- Thank you.
- I mean, Anyone is caught dancing

11:38.691 --> 11:40.326
with their butt facing
their partner,

11:40.359 --> 11:42.795
you will be sent home
immediately.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.131
Immediately.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.181
Hello?

12:07.753 --> 12:08.921
Is someone there?

12:10.823 --> 12:12.057
Did I scare you?

12:12.091 --> 12:14.326
Pfft, no.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.163
Really? Because you jumped
like 10 feet high, so...

12:18.197 --> 12:21.033
You know, I jump a lot.

12:21.066 --> 12:24.136
It's how I stay
in such great shape.

12:26.005 --> 12:27.339
- That's good.
- I, um...

12:27.373 --> 12:29.408
Yeah, I didn't see you
at school today.

12:29.441 --> 12:31.377
Aw, what, you were
looking for me?

12:31.410 --> 12:33.979
No, no. I just...
I just observed...

12:34.013 --> 12:36.749
No, I'm homeschooled.

12:36.782 --> 12:37.883
Oh, by your dad?

12:38.884 --> 12:41.086
He seems...

12:41.120 --> 12:42.354
nice.

12:42.388 --> 12:45.391
And intense.
And a little tense.

12:45.424 --> 12:48.127
Don't take it personally.
He doesn't really like anyone.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.496
Yeah. So, um...

12:50.529 --> 12:53.265
So is there anything,
like, fun to do around here

12:53.298 --> 12:57.102
aside from scaring
your neighbors?

12:57.136 --> 12:59.104
Okay. There is one thing
that I like to do.

12:59.138 --> 13:00.472
Yeah?

13:02.207 --> 13:03.475
Come with me.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.179
Uh...

13:09.782 --> 13:12.484
- Hey, where are we going?
- Don't worry. It'll be fun.

13:16.789 --> 13:18.757
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

13:18.791 --> 13:20.325
Yes. Come on.

13:26.031 --> 13:29.134
This way.

13:29.168 --> 13:32.004
Are you taking me somewhere
to kill me? I'm just curious.

13:32.037 --> 13:33.972
I'm playing it by ear.

13:39.578 --> 13:41.413
Hannah?

13:44.483 --> 13:47.753
Yes, Zach, follow the stranger
into the woods.

13:52.558 --> 13:55.427
Come on, scaredy-cat.
We're almost there.

13:58.464 --> 14:00.432
Okay. Just a little further.

14:04.403 --> 14:08.207
Okay. Just wait here.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.909
Okay.

14:10.943 --> 14:13.045
Where exactly is here?

14:13.078 --> 14:15.380
Watch this.

14:22.955 --> 14:24.323
Whoa.

14:24.356 --> 14:26.525
What do you think?

14:28.060 --> 14:30.295
Uh...

14:30.329 --> 14:32.030
It's not what
I was expecting.

14:36.435 --> 14:39.571
So, what is this place?

14:39.605 --> 14:43.342
Well, they built it years ago,
but then they ran out of money.

14:43.375 --> 14:44.910
Now it just sits here.

14:44.943 --> 14:48.480
Come on, this is
my favorite part.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.886
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

14:53.919 --> 14:56.221
What are you afraid of?
I do this all the time.

14:56.255 --> 14:57.589
I'm... I'm not afraid.

14:57.623 --> 15:01.994
I'm just not current
with my tetanus shots.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.364
I hate the suburbs.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.536
Come on.

15:16.675 --> 15:19.444
You can do it.
Just don't look down.

15:19.478 --> 15:21.580
I know.

15:21.613 --> 15:23.382
You're not gonna fall.

15:23.415 --> 15:26.418
I wasn't planning on it.

15:26.451 --> 15:28.487
- There you go.
- Hi.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.888
Hi.

15:29.922 --> 15:31.390
All right.

15:31.423 --> 15:34.326
So I'm high off
of the ground.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.033
It's cool, right?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.100
Yeah. It's cool.

15:42.134 --> 15:46.004
You can see everything
from up here.

15:46.038 --> 15:47.206
So...

15:47.239 --> 15:50.342
why'd you move to Madison?

15:50.375 --> 15:53.045
Well, my mom said to me:

15:53.078 --> 15:55.347
"Zach, if you could live
anywhere in the world,

15:55.380 --> 15:57.049
where would it be?"

15:57.082 --> 16:01.320
And I said, "Can we please move
to Madison, Delaware?"

16:01.353 --> 16:02.554
"That'd be my dream."

16:02.588 --> 16:04.022
Are you always
this sarcastic?

16:04.056 --> 16:05.991
Always?
No, that's a strong word.

16:06.024 --> 16:09.161
Not always. Usually.

16:10.362 --> 16:12.598
I'm sorry. It's just, um...

16:12.631 --> 16:14.399
It's just been
me and my mom

16:14.433 --> 16:16.401
since my dad
died last year, so yeah.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.136
I'm sorry.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.539
I don't really
think about it much anymore.

16:20.572 --> 16:22.307
What about you?

16:22.341 --> 16:23.709
Well, I never knew my mom,

16:23.742 --> 16:27.980
and we're always moving
from one town to the next.

16:28.013 --> 16:29.414
That really sucks.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.016
It's fine.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.188
Hey,

16:36.221 --> 16:41.059
can I ask you something
really serious, Hannah?

16:41.093 --> 16:42.928
Yeah. What?

16:45.631 --> 16:47.366
How do we get down?

16:49.401 --> 16:51.069
I'm serious.
Is there a plan?

16:51.103 --> 16:53.205
- No.
- How do you normally get down?

16:53.238 --> 16:55.073
You can't. You're stuck.

16:57.442 --> 16:58.610
Wow, I can't believe

16:58.644 --> 17:00.479
you ate that cotton candy.

17:00.512 --> 17:02.114
And you know what's scary

17:02.147 --> 17:05.384
is it actually tasted
kind of fine.

17:10.388 --> 17:12.758
So, uh, thanks for tonight.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.761
That was the least terrible time
I've had here.

17:15.794 --> 17:18.363
Oh, Zach.
That's so sweet.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.665
That's... I... Really.

17:20.699 --> 17:22.401
Okay.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.671
Hey, Hannah. I'm...

17:25.704 --> 17:27.439
I'm probably gonna
take out the trash

17:27.472 --> 17:29.241
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

17:29.274 --> 17:32.177
So, you know, you feel like
creeping up on someone,

17:32.210 --> 17:33.712
that works for me.

17:33.745 --> 17:36.381
All right. I'll keep that
in mind, scaredy-cat.

17:36.415 --> 17:37.582
Hannah!

17:37.616 --> 17:39.251
What are you doing out here?

17:39.284 --> 17:41.620
I'm so sorry.

17:41.653 --> 17:43.655
This is your last warning.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.691
You stay away from us,

17:45.724 --> 17:48.493
or something very bad
will happen.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.162
I believe you.

17:57.769 --> 17:59.404
"What is X?"

18:01.573 --> 18:02.741
What is X?

18:02.774 --> 18:04.376
Dad, it's not a big deal.

18:04.409 --> 18:06.111
Hannah, you have to understand...

18:06.144 --> 18:07.646
I don't have to understand anything.

18:07.679 --> 18:09.681
We were just talking. Why can't I have
friends like normal people?

18:09.715 --> 18:12.150
- You know why!
- That is not fair!

18:12.184 --> 18:13.685
You can't just lock me up
all the time.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.721
You are never allowed
to see that boy!

18:15.754 --> 18:17.456
You understand me? Ever!

18:17.489 --> 18:19.358
Dad, please calm down.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.560
- Hannah.
- No! Aah!

18:32.104 --> 18:33.638
What?

18:50.489 --> 18:51.757
- What?
- I heard a scream.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.492
- Is Hannah okay?
- There was no scream.

18:53.525 --> 18:55.193
- You didn't hear anything. Get out of here
- What are you talking about?

18:55.227 --> 18:57.229
or the last scream you hear
will be your own.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.663
No. Wait, wait, I...

19:03.168 --> 19:04.503
Mom.

19:04.536 --> 19:06.805
- Hey, Mom. Mom. Mom.
- Oh, hey, sweetie.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.740
Hey, how do you feel
about quinoa for dinner?

19:08.774 --> 19:10.275
Mom, Hannah's in trouble.

19:10.308 --> 19:12.310
Oh, who's Hannah?

19:15.914 --> 19:17.883
Madison County 911.

19:17.916 --> 19:20.218
Hi, yes. Uh,
I live on Monroe. Um...

19:20.252 --> 19:22.621
- Uh, it's an emergency, I think.
- Zach, what's going on?

19:22.654 --> 19:26.224
Yeah. Maybe possibly
a domestic disturbance. I don't know.

19:32.264 --> 19:34.366
- You're under arrest!
- Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:34.399 --> 19:37.569
I love that enthusiasm.
I love that. Keep it.

19:37.602 --> 19:39.137
But we're just...
We're not there yet.

19:39.171 --> 19:41.139
Hello, sir. My name's
Officer Stevens.

19:41.173 --> 19:43.775
- This is Training Officer Brooks.
- I'm sorry about that before.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.277
You don't need to be sorry.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.446
- You're doing a great job.
- Really?

19:47.479 --> 19:51.516
We got a call about a possible
10-16 at your residence.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.251
Which is...?

19:53.285 --> 19:54.553
Um... Don't tell me.

19:54.586 --> 19:57.689
It's a domestic disturbance.

19:57.722 --> 19:59.624
- Absolutely right.
- Really?

19:59.658 --> 20:01.326
Oh, Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

20:01.359 --> 20:03.361
Well, That's strange, because
I've been here alone all night

20:03.395 --> 20:05.630
- and I haven't heard a thing.
- No, no, he's lying.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.300
Where's Hannah?
I know it was her screaming.

20:09.568 --> 20:11.203
Okay, yes.
Hannah's my daughter,

20:11.236 --> 20:12.838
and she's been staying with me
for a while

20:12.871 --> 20:15.273
while her mother
sorted a few things out

20:15.307 --> 20:17.776
- with her new husband.
- Ah, yeah.

20:17.809 --> 20:19.878
She flew back to London
yesterday morning.

20:19.911 --> 20:21.813
All right, well,
that checks out.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.748
Apologies, sir.
Thank you for your time.

20:23.782 --> 20:26.651
We're sorry for the disturbance.

20:33.558 --> 20:35.193
Surround sounds.

20:35.227 --> 20:37.295
I didn't know being
an audiophile was a crime.

20:37.329 --> 20:38.697
Being a what...
A what-a-phile?

20:38.730 --> 20:40.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:40.799 --> 20:42.567
That just means that he is
a connoisseur

20:42.601 --> 20:44.302
of high-end
audio equipment.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.238
Oh.

20:46.271 --> 20:48.607
Hi. I'm so sorry.
We haven't properly met.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.575
I'm Gale Cooper,
your new neighbor.

20:50.609 --> 20:52.444
It's a beautiful home
you have.

20:52.477 --> 20:55.213
Pleasure's mine. Thank you so
much for stopping by

20:55.247 --> 20:59.217
and bringing your delightful son
and the police.

20:59.251 --> 21:00.218
Again, I'm so sorry.

21:00.252 --> 21:01.720
Apologies for this, sir.

21:01.753 --> 21:02.954
We hate coming into the home

21:02.988 --> 21:04.856
of an upstanding citizen
such as yourself.

21:04.890 --> 21:08.260
Really sorry. I mean, obviously,
you're not doing anything...

21:08.293 --> 21:10.395
If you would like
to press charges,

21:10.428 --> 21:12.597
we would love to help you.

21:12.631 --> 21:14.332
Hannah! Hannah!

21:14.366 --> 21:15.634
- Whoa!
- Hannah!

21:15.667 --> 21:16.902
- Hold on, big guy.
- No, no!

21:16.935 --> 21:18.570
Just look upstairs.
Trust me.

21:18.603 --> 21:19.938
Should I tase him?
I'll tase him.

21:19.971 --> 21:21.840
I like that moxie,
but we're gonna hold off.

21:21.873 --> 21:23.642
You have any idea
what the penalty is

21:23.675 --> 21:24.943
for filing a false
police report?

21:24.976 --> 21:26.578
- Three years.
- Close.

21:26.611 --> 21:27.946
It's actually
a written warning.

21:27.979 --> 21:30.482
Hold on, hold on. Mom, tell me
you don't believe him.

21:30.515 --> 21:31.917
Surround sound?
Seriously?

21:31.950 --> 21:34.986
Zach, enough. Go home.

21:41.059 --> 21:43.595
Oh, officers. I'm so sorry.

21:43.628 --> 21:44.930
It's all right, ma'am.

21:44.963 --> 21:46.831
I feel like
we should recommend

21:46.865 --> 21:48.433
a good treatment center
for your son.

21:48.466 --> 21:50.635
- Yeah. That kid's on drugs.
- That kid is on drugs.

21:50.669 --> 21:53.939
Good night.

21:53.972 --> 21:55.640
Gale.

21:55.674 --> 21:57.409
It's Lorraine.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.577
I can see you.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.978
It's your sister.

22:00.011 --> 22:02.914
- Hi. Thanks for coming.
- Hi.

22:02.948 --> 22:05.050
I have to chaperone the dance
at the high school.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.918
I don't wanna leave
Zach alone tonight.

22:06.952 --> 22:10.789
Gale. He's a teenage boy
having a hard time adjusting.

22:10.822 --> 22:11.990
You know what he needs?

22:12.023 --> 22:14.993
A night in with his aunt,
BeDazzling.

22:15.026 --> 22:16.061
Duh.

22:16.094 --> 22:17.929
Oh, thanks.
I hate fighting with him.

22:17.963 --> 22:20.799
I know. It'll get better.
Just give it some time.

22:20.832 --> 22:23.401
All right. Kit coming through.
And don't worry.

22:23.435 --> 22:25.971
It's gonna be all
about Zach tonight.

22:26.004 --> 22:27.739
Zach!

22:27.772 --> 22:30.408
So we went out
to sushi on Wednesday.

22:30.442 --> 22:32.077
And we both ordered
the chicken teriyaki,

22:32.110 --> 22:33.945
which is like, "It's fate."

22:33.979 --> 22:36.381
And then I haven't heard
from him since, you know?

22:36.414 --> 22:38.383
Which is a bummer,
because I really liked him.

22:38.416 --> 22:39.851
He didn't laugh
at any of my jokes,

22:39.884 --> 22:42.087
but I felt like
there was something there.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.889
I don't know.
Not like I even care.

22:44.923 --> 22:48.093
It's like, whatever.
I should listen to my psychic.

22:48.126 --> 22:52.430
She says, "Stop dating losers,
and never go on a plane."

22:52.464 --> 22:53.498
I knew it.

22:53.531 --> 22:56.067
Oh, so you think
he's playing hard to get?

22:56.101 --> 22:58.770
Or the more likely scenario:

22:58.803 --> 23:00.772
He lost his phone in,
like, a fire.

23:00.805 --> 23:02.440
Yeah, I think he lost
his phone.

23:02.474 --> 23:03.875
Yeah. I do too.

23:03.908 --> 23:06.344
You know, I...
I totally forgot.

23:06.378 --> 23:08.980
I have a huge test on Monday
that I gotta study for.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.515
So I'm just gonna do that
all night,

23:10.548 --> 23:13.585
and definitely
don't come in my room.

23:13.618 --> 23:15.720
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. See you.

23:15.754 --> 23:17.422
Night, sweetie.

23:18.623 --> 23:20.592
But you know what?
I'm just gonna call him.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.627
Now I'm worried he's dead.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.602
Hey, hey, hey.

23:30.635 --> 23:32.737
Over here.

23:32.771 --> 23:34.372
Wait. So how is this gonna work?

23:34.406 --> 23:35.907
Are you my wingman,
or am I yours?

23:35.940 --> 23:37.742
Is that what you're wearing
to the dance?

23:37.776 --> 23:39.144
I gotta tell you something.
Come here. Get down.

23:39.177 --> 23:40.945
Dude, no. This is a new suit.
Alright? Get off.

23:40.979 --> 23:43.048
- Where are the girls?
- Uh, yeah, about that.

23:43.081 --> 23:44.783
I just said that
to get you over here.

23:44.816 --> 23:45.950
I need your help.

23:45.984 --> 23:47.519
So there are no girls?

23:47.552 --> 23:49.154
Well, there is one girl.

23:49.187 --> 23:50.488
Oh! My man!

23:50.522 --> 23:52.157
- Shh!
- What? What?

23:52.190 --> 23:55.727
But she's locked in this house,
and her dad's a psychopath.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.762
Does she have a friend?

23:57.796 --> 24:00.098
No. I'm serious.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.002
You know, you said there was
gonna be girls,

24:04.035 --> 24:05.637
and not only
are there no girls,

24:05.670 --> 24:07.872
but there's a psychopath,
and I'm in a suit.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.546
How do you know
this guy's going to leave?

24:09.574 --> 24:11.176
I called him and pretended
to be the cops.

24:11.209 --> 24:13.044
And I asked him to come
to the station.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.680
- Dude, You can get in big trouble for that.
- It's actually just a written warning.

24:15.714 --> 24:18.817
Dude. It's wet dirt, dude.
My pants are gonna get muddied.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.652
He's right there.

24:26.224 --> 24:27.492
Whoa.

24:35.967 --> 24:38.036
All right. Let's go.

24:43.541 --> 24:44.676
Come on.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.211
Okay, okay.

24:46.244 --> 24:48.680
Dude, my dry-cleaning bill's
gonna be ridiculous.

24:48.713 --> 24:50.515
Just come on.

24:55.854 --> 24:58.123
Whoa. Where'd you learn that,
New York?

24:58.156 --> 25:00.225
- No, YouTube.
- Oh.

25:06.998 --> 25:08.800
Okay, stay here
and watch the driveway.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.569
Wait here by myself?
Out in the dark?

25:11.603 --> 25:13.671
Yes, Champ.
You're the lookout.

25:13.705 --> 25:15.940
If Shivers comes back,
you just give me a sign like:

25:17.642 --> 25:18.777
Okay, just so we're clear,

25:18.810 --> 25:22.580
if I sense any danger,
I will run the other way.

25:54.245 --> 25:55.280
Whoa!

25:59.851 --> 26:01.719
Where am I?

26:11.629 --> 26:14.132
What the hell, man? You're supposed
to be the lookout.

26:14.165 --> 26:15.700
And that's not gonna change.

26:15.733 --> 26:17.635
I'll just be the lookout,
you know, in here.

26:17.669 --> 26:21.139
No, no, by definition you have
to be somewhere out, looking.

26:21.172 --> 26:22.907
Let me explain something
to you, Zacharias.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.243
You know how they say
teenagers have no fear of death?

26:25.276 --> 26:27.812
That they're never gonna
get hurt? Well, not me, okay?

26:27.846 --> 26:30.181
I was born with the gift
of fear. I remember being 4,

26:30.215 --> 26:31.783
being pushed on a swing
and thinking,

26:31.816 --> 26:33.885
- "This is how it ends."
- You're not gonna die.

26:33.918 --> 26:35.653
All right?
At least not today.

26:35.687 --> 26:37.055
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

26:37.088 --> 26:38.723
- Yeah, you're right.
- Okay.

26:38.756 --> 26:40.592
I'm being ridiculous.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.062
Oh, bear traps.

26:46.297 --> 26:51.035
Who puts bear traps in their
basement? I mean, seriously.

26:54.105 --> 26:55.773
Let's go.

26:57.075 --> 26:59.777
Let's go outside
where it's safe.

26:59.811 --> 27:02.747
Where there's no bear traps.

27:12.724 --> 27:15.093
I think I swallowed some web.

27:27.272 --> 27:30.675
Dude, this way.
Come on. Come on.

27:43.421 --> 27:45.723
Up there.

27:45.757 --> 27:47.091
Oh...

27:56.100 --> 27:58.069
It's coming from that room.

28:00.238 --> 28:01.873
Hannah?

28:26.397 --> 28:29.067
That's weird.
It's like the noise

28:29.100 --> 28:31.102
is coming from this bookcase.

28:31.135 --> 28:33.137
Well, it's an old house.

28:34.939 --> 28:38.209
Whoa. Check this out.

28:38.242 --> 28:39.911
The Scarecrow Walks
at Midnight.

28:39.944 --> 28:44.449
The Ghost Next Door,
Night of the Living Dummy.

28:44.482 --> 28:46.784
These are all
Goosebumps manuscripts.

28:46.818 --> 28:49.187
What's he doing with a bunch
of kids' books?

28:49.220 --> 28:51.189
These aren't
kids' books. Okay?

28:51.222 --> 28:52.991
Kids' books help you
fall asleep.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.425
These books keep you up
all night.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.694
- Okay.
- "R.L. Stine."

28:56.728 --> 28:58.463
Whatever happened
to that guy?

28:58.496 --> 29:00.264
Uh, who knows?
He disappeared one day.

29:00.298 --> 29:01.699
Does it matter? Let's go.

29:01.733 --> 29:03.234
The Abominable Snowman
of Pasadena.

29:03.267 --> 29:05.069
My grandma lives in Pasadena.

29:05.103 --> 29:06.871
I stopped visiting
after reading this.

29:06.904 --> 29:08.139
Okay.

29:08.172 --> 29:09.841
We're not here
for book club.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.343
I know, but why
are these books locked?

29:12.377 --> 29:14.112
I mean, who would
lock a book?

29:14.145 --> 29:16.347
Maybe there's like
a key or something

29:16.381 --> 29:18.182
we can unlock it with.

29:18.216 --> 29:22.920
Okay, if it really matters that
much, look at this. All right?

29:22.954 --> 29:24.155
Mystery solved.

29:24.188 --> 29:26.224
Let's get back to why...
Look out!

29:29.794 --> 29:30.928
Zach?

29:30.962 --> 29:33.731
Hey, Hannah.

29:33.765 --> 29:35.967
What are you doing
in my house?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.303
I thought you were
chained up, possibly.

29:39.337 --> 29:41.439
- Why did you think that?
- Because I heard you scream,

29:41.472 --> 29:44.142
and then I called the... police.

29:44.175 --> 29:45.510
Okay, both of you
need to go right now.

29:45.543 --> 29:47.879
- Yes. Okay.
- Wait. One... One second.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.782
Hi. Hi, I'm Champ.
Nice to meet you.

29:50.815 --> 29:53.851
Hey, we're going to
the semiformal later tonight,

29:53.885 --> 29:58.489
and I don't know, you should
come and invite a friend.

29:58.523 --> 30:00.391
I really don't care
what she looks like.

30:00.425 --> 30:02.360
Did you unlock a book?

30:02.393 --> 30:04.762
Yeah. I did. I'm sorry.
It's around somewhere.

30:04.796 --> 30:06.964
I just dropped it. And I'll
put it back where it belongs

30:06.998 --> 30:08.966
and we'll be out of your hair.
Look, Here it is...

30:09.000 --> 30:10.134
No! Don't open it!

30:12.270 --> 30:14.205
No!

31:16.534 --> 31:20.271
- What's going on?
- Nobody make a sound.

31:40.224 --> 31:41.459
My dad's gonna kill me.

31:46.063 --> 31:48.065
Wait! Zach!

31:48.099 --> 31:49.934
Zach!

32:00.144 --> 32:02.547
Wait, Hannah.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.582
Hannah. Hannah, wait.

32:04.615 --> 32:06.384
Go home, Zach.
You're in over your head.

32:06.417 --> 32:07.885
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

32:07.919 --> 32:09.453
No, I can't explain.
I have to go.

32:09.487 --> 32:11.322
Zach, wait. Wait.

32:11.355 --> 32:12.623
Come on. Listen.

32:12.657 --> 32:16.127
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Dude, what are you doing?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.595
Dude. Dude, get off me.

32:17.628 --> 32:20.398
Listen to me very carefully.
That's the Abominable Snowman.

32:20.431 --> 32:22.233
You don't get that nickname
by accident.

32:22.266 --> 32:23.534
And it just crawled
out of a book.

32:23.568 --> 32:25.203
That doesn't just happen, Zach!

32:25.236 --> 32:27.004
I'm going after Hannah.

32:27.038 --> 32:30.107
Look, I read what it did
to Pasadena.

32:30.141 --> 32:32.076
It's no joke, man.

32:52.129 --> 32:53.431
She went in there.

32:53.464 --> 32:55.633
Yeah. She's not the only one
who went in there.

33:02.974 --> 33:05.509
Dude, we should call the cops.

33:05.543 --> 33:08.446
Have you met the cops
in this town?

33:08.479 --> 33:10.381
Fair enough.

33:25.763 --> 33:28.666
Do you see the scratches
on that wall?

33:30.067 --> 33:31.602
Yes.

33:31.636 --> 33:34.171
Just making sure.

33:36.540 --> 33:39.277
- Oh!
- Is that your scream?

33:39.310 --> 33:41.412
Don't judge me.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.115
Over here.

33:44.148 --> 33:45.683
This way.

33:53.591 --> 33:56.460
What is she gonna do,
read it a story?

34:11.809 --> 34:14.779
Hannah? What is happening?
How did that pop out of a book?

34:14.812 --> 34:17.447
- Shh. It's in here.
- Hey, we should get a gun.

34:17.481 --> 34:21.085
Are you kidding?
We need a tank.

34:21.118 --> 34:24.221
Wait. He's made
out of snow.

34:24.255 --> 34:25.389
- Flamethrower.
- Bag of salt.

34:25.422 --> 34:27.091
- Flamethrower.
- Quiet.

34:27.123 --> 34:29.092
He can't be killed.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.241
It's candy.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.518
Look out!

35:10.701 --> 35:13.404
Come on. It's distracted.

35:13.437 --> 35:16.107
- Hannah, come on. Let's go.
- No, what are you doing?

35:16.140 --> 35:18.175
Get off. No. Stop it!
No, you don't understand.

35:18.209 --> 35:20.444
The only way to stop them is
to suck them back into the book.

35:20.478 --> 35:22.747
Drop the book and let it
suck itself back in.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.815
No, I'm not close enough.

35:34.592 --> 35:36.327
What are you doing?
Just open the book.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.596
Just wait.

35:38.629 --> 35:40.765
- Hannah, open the book.
- Not yet.

35:40.798 --> 35:43.167
- Hannah!
- Now!

35:46.270 --> 35:47.438
The book.

35:47.471 --> 35:48.606
Hannah, what are you doing?

35:48.639 --> 35:50.207
- Hannah.
- Huh?

35:57.348 --> 35:59.550
- No.
- No.

36:03.654 --> 36:05.256
Don't let it get the book!

36:15.466 --> 36:17.301
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:17.334 --> 36:19.804
- Guys, come on, let's go!
- Come on. Come on.

36:19.837 --> 36:22.173
Over here! Come on!

36:22.206 --> 36:24.608
- Come on.
- Good idea. Punch it.

36:27.945 --> 36:30.147
Bad idea. Bad idea.
Get off that thing.

36:30.181 --> 36:32.316
Aah!

36:58.442 --> 36:59.743
Run.

36:59.777 --> 37:03.747
Hurry, this way.
Guys, come on. In here.

37:03.781 --> 37:06.350
Guys, come on. Hurry!

37:19.730 --> 37:21.699
Yes.

37:31.475 --> 37:33.344
Whoa!

38:26.063 --> 38:29.934
All of you in the car, now!

38:31.402 --> 38:32.870
What are you gonna do to us?

38:32.903 --> 38:34.338
Silence.

38:34.371 --> 38:35.839
- We can't ask questions I just wanted...?
- Shut up!

38:35.873 --> 38:37.541
Dad, they were only
trying to help.

38:37.575 --> 38:40.277
I told you to stay away from us,
or something bad would happen.

38:40.311 --> 38:43.380
But that's the problem with kids
today. They don't listen.

38:43.414 --> 38:45.916
You had to pick
Abominable Snowman of Pasadena.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.852
You couldn't have picked
Little Shop of Hamsters.

38:48.886 --> 38:51.288
You're him, aren't you?

38:51.322 --> 38:53.691
Hmm?

38:53.724 --> 38:56.660
- You're R.L. Stine.
- R.L. who?

38:56.694 --> 38:57.828
I don't know who that is.

38:57.861 --> 38:59.330
Oh, really?

39:00.798 --> 39:03.367
Well, just as well,
because his books suck.

39:04.668 --> 39:06.003
What are you doing?

39:06.036 --> 39:08.706
I can't decide
which one I hate more:

39:08.739 --> 39:10.774
Monster Blood
or Go Eat Worms!

39:10.808 --> 39:12.710
I'm so confused.

39:12.743 --> 39:14.545
You see the endings coming
from a mile away.

39:14.578 --> 39:17.681
It's like stop trying to be
Stephen King, man.

39:22.019 --> 39:23.921
Let me tell you something
about Steve King.

39:23.954 --> 39:26.957
Steve King wishes
he could write like me,

39:26.991 --> 39:28.993
and I've sold
way more books than him,

39:29.026 --> 39:30.694
but nobody ever
talks about that!

39:30.728 --> 39:32.930
- Okay.
- Way more books!

39:32.963 --> 39:34.865
- Dad...
- Aah!

39:34.898 --> 39:38.469
Your face is doing
the red thing again.

39:38.502 --> 39:39.803
No way.

39:39.837 --> 39:42.573
Wait, you're R.L. Stine?
That's you?

39:42.606 --> 39:44.475
Really? Really?

39:44.508 --> 39:46.043
Hey, can I get a picture
real quick?

39:46.076 --> 39:47.678
- No. No.
- Come on. Come on.

39:47.711 --> 39:49.113
- The answer's "yes."
- I said no.

39:49.146 --> 39:52.316
What? I... No!
Get that thing out of here!

39:53.751 --> 39:56.687
I'm sorry. I just wanted a photo
real quick for my Instagram.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.088
Oh, is that all?
Let me see.

39:58.122 --> 40:00.424
- Oh, yeah. Here you go.
- Thank you.

40:21.111 --> 40:22.479
Hey, hey,
what happens now?

40:22.513 --> 40:23.881
You go home,
put on your p.j.'s,

40:23.914 --> 40:25.549
get your blankie,
you go nap-nap.

40:25.582 --> 40:27.918
In the morning, this will
all just feel like a bad dream.

40:27.951 --> 40:30.020
- Dad, wait.
- There's no time. Start packing.

40:30.054 --> 40:32.122
We're moving again.

40:34.058 --> 40:37.928
So, what do you wanna do now?

40:37.961 --> 40:39.997
Zach, dude.

40:40.030 --> 40:42.833
But I don't wanna leave.
I like it here.

40:42.866 --> 40:44.635
Hannah, you have to understand.

40:44.668 --> 40:46.804
I don't have
to understand anything.

40:46.837 --> 40:48.539
Why can't we be normal for once?

40:48.572 --> 40:51.442
Because we're not a normal
family. Now go get your things.

40:51.475 --> 40:52.643
I'm so over this.

40:52.676 --> 40:55.479
Oh! Teenagers.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.726
I could've killed you.

41:08.759 --> 41:12.162
- That was a terrible throw.
- How?

41:12.196 --> 41:13.864
What are you doing here?
Go home.

41:13.897 --> 41:16.066
No. Not until you explain
what's going on.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.001
No, no, no.
I can't explain it.

41:18.035 --> 41:20.471
We were almost just eaten
by Frosty the Snowman,

41:20.504 --> 41:22.673
which should be impossible,
by the way, so try.

41:22.706 --> 41:25.209
Okay, look...

41:26.510 --> 41:28.612
Where do I begin?
When I was younger,

41:28.645 --> 41:31.081
I suffered from terrible
allergies that kept me indoors.

41:31.115 --> 41:34.551
And all the kids
threw rocks at my window

41:34.585 --> 41:36.720
and called me names.

41:36.754 --> 41:38.689
So I created my own friends.

41:38.722 --> 41:43.527
Monsters, demons, ghouls
to terrorize my neighborhood

41:43.560 --> 41:45.229
and all the kids
that made fun of me.

41:45.262 --> 41:48.966
And they became real to me.

41:48.999 --> 41:52.669
And then one day,
they actually...

41:52.703 --> 41:57.207
became real.

42:00.144 --> 42:03.213
My monsters literally
leapt off the page.

42:03.247 --> 42:05.849
As long as the books
remain locked, we're safe.

42:05.883 --> 42:08.118
But when they open,

42:08.152 --> 42:12.956
well, you've just seen
what happens.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.692
I'm allergic to dust mites.

42:15.726 --> 42:17.594
What's your point?

42:17.628 --> 42:19.563
I'm just saying,
I have allergies too.

42:19.596 --> 42:21.098
So I understand.

42:23.133 --> 42:26.603
Why am I talking to you?
Hannah, let's go.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.642
- Hannah!
- I'm sorry.

42:34.678 --> 42:36.146
Let's go.

42:38.081 --> 42:39.783
Hannah, you grab A to M,
I'll get M to Z.

42:39.817 --> 42:42.753
And keep the man-eating plant
away from the bug-eyed aliens.

42:42.786 --> 42:45.022
Oh, no. Not him.

42:45.055 --> 42:48.091
Hello, Papa.

42:51.962 --> 42:54.832
How long's it been?

42:54.865 --> 42:56.533
Feels like forever.

42:57.901 --> 42:59.536
Who are your new friends?

42:59.570 --> 43:01.538
- We're not friends.
- Barely know him.

43:01.572 --> 43:04.074
Slappy, it's so nice
to see you again.

43:04.107 --> 43:06.009
Did you miss me?

43:06.043 --> 43:07.778
Of course I missed you.

43:11.748 --> 43:14.184
So, what's the plan, friend?

43:14.218 --> 43:16.620
You must've brought me out
for something fun.

43:16.653 --> 43:19.723
Terrorize the locals?
Destroy the town?

43:19.756 --> 43:21.825
Let's get silly.

43:21.859 --> 43:23.160
You guessed it, Slappy.

43:23.193 --> 43:25.963
I'm going to destroy
Madison, and I...

43:25.996 --> 43:28.098
And I couldn't do it
without you.

43:28.131 --> 43:31.001
Aw, shucks.
You're giving me...

43:31.034 --> 43:33.337
Oh, what's the word?

43:33.370 --> 43:35.339
Goosebumps.

43:36.807 --> 43:38.775
Oh, my God. He's so creepy.

43:38.809 --> 43:40.878
Oh, he is such a crack-up.

43:40.911 --> 43:43.213
Such a clever dummy.

43:43.247 --> 43:47.050
Who are you calling
"dummy," dummy?

43:51.688 --> 43:53.690
You're trying
to put me back in?

43:53.724 --> 43:56.226
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't be silly.

43:56.260 --> 43:58.962
I know when
you're lying to me, Papa.

44:02.132 --> 44:05.235
You've made Slappy
very unhappy.

44:05.269 --> 44:09.640
He's not going back
on the shelf ever again.

44:09.673 --> 44:11.074
Slappy, no, wait!

44:12.910 --> 44:14.678
I think it's time I started

44:14.711 --> 44:17.180
pulling the strings
in this relationship.

44:17.214 --> 44:21.184
Tonight is gonna be the best
story you've ever written.

44:21.218 --> 44:25.022
All of your children
are coming out to play.

44:28.191 --> 44:30.727
Oh, thank God he's gone.

44:30.761 --> 44:33.196
Oh, God. He's gone.

44:35.098 --> 44:37.067
And he's taken all the books.

44:48.946 --> 44:51.815
That one's a real page-turner.

44:59.990 --> 45:02.426
Congratulations.
You've just released a demon.

45:02.459 --> 45:05.896
A ventriloquist dummy with
a serious Napoleonic complex.

45:05.929 --> 45:08.098
I only opened one book, and now
I see that was a mistake.

45:08.131 --> 45:10.767
The snowman must've knocked
Slappy's book down.

45:10.801 --> 45:13.003
I still blame him.
I don't like you, boy.

45:14.404 --> 45:16.239
It's locked from the outside.

45:18.475 --> 45:21.845
Out the kitchen door.
Go now.

45:27.851 --> 45:30.120
- Why is that here?
- I don't know.

46:03.420 --> 46:06.323
Maybe they're friendly.

46:07.457 --> 46:10.160
Not friendly.
Definitely not friendly.

46:10.193 --> 46:11.895
Ooh.

46:20.437 --> 46:22.172
He's stuck to my face.

46:22.205 --> 46:24.374
Definitely not friendly.

46:24.408 --> 46:25.942
Dad! Aah!

46:27.844 --> 46:29.246
Hold on. I'll save you.

46:31.481 --> 46:33.817
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

46:41.058 --> 46:43.393
Ready, set, go.

46:49.032 --> 46:50.467
I'm sorry.

46:52.302 --> 46:54.871
Help me. Oh, no, no, no.
Help, someone.

46:54.905 --> 46:56.273
Get back. Get back.

47:01.311 --> 47:02.813
Get back.

47:02.846 --> 47:05.048
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

47:05.082 --> 47:06.349
Heave-ho.

47:07.584 --> 47:09.553
- Help me. Help me. Get them off.
- Okay, okay.

47:09.586 --> 47:11.855
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

47:11.888 --> 47:13.323
Quickly.

47:14.324 --> 47:16.059
Shut it. Shut it.

47:16.093 --> 47:19.830
- Did you get them all?
- Heave-ho. Heave-ho...

47:19.863 --> 47:20.864
Untie me.

47:20.897 --> 47:22.499
I imagined something different.

47:22.532 --> 47:24.401
"Come over to my house.
There will be girls.

47:24.434 --> 47:26.036
I'm your wingman."

47:35.345 --> 47:37.247
- Oh, no, no, no.
- We got to get out of here.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.448
We need to get
to the basement.

47:38.482 --> 47:41.218
- It's locked.
- I picked it.

47:41.251 --> 47:43.186
That's breaking and entering!

47:45.222 --> 47:47.424
Watch out for the bear traps.

47:50.494 --> 47:52.062
Why'd it have to be bear traps?

47:52.095 --> 47:55.065
All right, come on. Hurry.
Come on.

48:09.513 --> 48:13.450
- Lock it! Lock it!
- Okay.

48:13.483 --> 48:15.452
Why couldn't you have
written stories

48:15.485 --> 48:17.487
about rainbows and unicorns?

48:17.521 --> 48:20.056
Because that doesn't sell
400 million copies.

48:20.090 --> 48:21.324
Whoa, domestic?

48:21.358 --> 48:22.959
No, worldwide.

48:22.993 --> 48:25.428
It's still very impressive.
Shut up.

48:34.004 --> 48:35.305
What is that?

48:56.693 --> 48:58.995
- He's burning the books.
- Why's he doing that?

48:59.029 --> 49:01.531
So there's no way to get
the monsters back inside.

49:01.565 --> 49:05.001
It's Slappy's revenge.

49:05.035 --> 49:08.471
Slappy's Revenge.
That's a good title.

49:14.544 --> 49:16.379
Sorry, folks. I'd slow down,

49:16.413 --> 49:18.348
but I can't reach the brake.

49:21.685 --> 49:25.055
Hey, check out
my new best seller.

49:25.088 --> 49:27.624
It'll grow on you.

49:34.064 --> 49:38.034
Dropped calls are gonna be the
least of this town's problems.

49:39.369 --> 49:42.706
I'm driving myself crazy!

49:56.419 --> 49:59.356
The town has been invaded.
Communications are down.

49:59.389 --> 50:04.327
We're talking mass chaos,
and no one knows how to stop it.

50:04.361 --> 50:05.729
What do you think?

50:05.762 --> 50:08.465
I'm not sure. I...
I'm not... I don't know.

50:08.498 --> 50:11.067
It's The Blob.

50:11.101 --> 50:13.470
The Blob.
The original one with Steve McQueen.

50:13.503 --> 50:16.473
Oh, I can't believe
you don't know that movie.

50:16.506 --> 50:18.708
Come over to my house.
I got it on LaserDisc.

50:18.742 --> 50:20.043
We'll wa...

50:21.378 --> 50:23.647
Power went out again.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.750
God. All night with this.

50:26.783 --> 50:30.053
Well, these emergency lights
should kick on soon.

50:38.461 --> 50:41.097
Somebody left
their ventriloquist dummy.

50:43.099 --> 50:45.502
Who you calling "dummy"?

50:45.535 --> 50:48.471
It's talking.
What is that thing?

50:48.505 --> 50:51.174
I come in peace. Unarmed.

50:51.207 --> 50:54.044
I just wanna read you
a bedtime story.

50:54.077 --> 50:55.578
- Sir, shut your mouth.
- Okay.

50:55.612 --> 50:57.247
Because that's not gonna stop me.

50:57.280 --> 50:59.049
- Hands where I can see them.
- Officers!

50:59.082 --> 51:03.086
You've been relieved
of your duties. Ha, ha!

51:03.119 --> 51:05.155
Now, freeze.

51:14.397 --> 51:16.433
Hello?

51:20.837 --> 51:24.140
Oh, hello, cutie.
You must be lost.

51:25.308 --> 51:26.676
Oh, and no tags.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.211
Well, let's get you some water.

51:28.244 --> 51:30.080
We'll take you around
the neighborhood

51:30.113 --> 51:31.748
and we'll find your owner.

51:31.781 --> 51:34.784
Is he handsome? Is he single?

51:34.818 --> 51:38.421
Is he thinking about leaving
his wife and needs a push?

51:42.659 --> 51:47.364
All right. Trying not to spill.

51:47.397 --> 51:49.399
Don't be clumsy, Lorraine.

51:49.432 --> 51:52.736
Okay, you must be so thirsty.

52:22.532 --> 52:24.601
Everyone in town's been frozen.

52:34.711 --> 52:38.114
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Dad.
Dad, what happened to...?

52:40.250 --> 52:41.384
Wait.

52:41.418 --> 52:43.586
Oh. Oh, thank God.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.889
Guys, false alarm.
It's not my dad.

52:47.524 --> 52:48.658
What are we going to do?

52:48.691 --> 52:49.826
Without those manuscripts,

52:49.859 --> 52:51.728
there's nothing I can do.

52:53.263 --> 52:55.231
If... If you wrote the monsters
off the page,

52:55.265 --> 52:57.400
then maybe there's a way
you could write them back on.

52:57.434 --> 52:59.536
Wait... Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Why don't you just do that?

52:59.569 --> 53:01.805
You have any idea how many
stories I'd have to write

53:01.838 --> 53:03.640
to capture every monster
I've ever created?

53:03.673 --> 53:05.375
I already have carpal tunnel
in both hands.

53:05.408 --> 53:07.644
Dad, just listen to him.
It's a great idea.

53:07.677 --> 53:11.181
Just one.
One story to capture them all.

53:11.214 --> 53:13.583
Hmm, simple.
Just one, one story,

53:13.616 --> 53:15.718
with every monster
I've ever created.

53:15.752 --> 53:20.490
Brilliant. Really good idea.
He's a keeper.

53:20.523 --> 53:21.658
You have a better idea?

53:21.691 --> 53:22.792
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

53:22.826 --> 53:24.894
A much better idea.

53:26.596 --> 53:28.798
No, not now, I don't, but...

53:28.832 --> 53:30.633
Okay, then we gotta
get you to a computer

53:30.667 --> 53:32.168
so you can start writing.
Alright? There's a...

53:32.202 --> 53:34.804
Look, there's a computer store.
Just break in.

53:34.838 --> 53:37.640
No, no, no.
I need my typewriter.

53:37.674 --> 53:39.776
- What?
- Every story I've written

53:39.809 --> 53:42.812
was on that Smith Corona.
It's not just me.

53:42.846 --> 53:46.683
That typewriter is special.

53:46.716 --> 53:49.819
It has a soul of its own.

53:49.853 --> 53:52.555
If I write on anything else,
it won't work.

53:52.589 --> 53:54.224
Where's the typewriter?

53:54.257 --> 53:56.493
Oh, don't worry.

53:56.526 --> 53:58.862
It's somewhere safe.

54:01.297 --> 54:03.333
♪ Get ugly ♪

54:04.467 --> 54:06.569
♪ And everybody say ♪

54:06.603 --> 54:08.404
♪ Get ugly ♪

54:10.773 --> 54:12.809
♪ Get ugly ♪

54:12.842 --> 54:14.310
♪ Get ugly ♪

54:14.344 --> 54:16.446
Come on.

54:16.479 --> 54:18.481
Come on,
come on, come on.

54:22.352 --> 54:23.820
Just give me one bar.

54:26.489 --> 54:29.259
This was working earlier.

54:29.292 --> 54:30.994
- Brains.
- Aah!

54:31.027 --> 54:33.796
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

54:33.830 --> 54:35.899
I mean, I did mean to scare you,
but in a playful way.

54:35.932 --> 54:38.968
So, uh, is everything okay?

54:40.470 --> 54:42.939
I'm sorry, I have to get hold
of my son,

54:42.972 --> 54:44.707
and I can't get any service.

54:44.741 --> 54:47.277
Yeah. No one can tonight.
It's weird.

54:50.780 --> 54:53.783
I don't know what's going
on with my phone.

54:53.816 --> 54:55.418
I can't get reception.

54:55.451 --> 54:57.487
Slappy's taken out
the cell-phone towers.

54:57.520 --> 54:59.689
That's what I'd do.

54:59.722 --> 55:01.925
He's cutting us off.
Isolating us.

55:01.958 --> 55:05.461
What was that?

55:07.564 --> 55:10.400
Ugh, it's the Invisible Boy.
He's a menace.

55:12.569 --> 55:14.404
Ow!

55:14.437 --> 55:16.372
Shove him out the window.

55:16.406 --> 55:17.674
Roll up the window.

55:17.707 --> 55:19.909
- He's got his tie!
- Help, help!

55:19.943 --> 55:21.511
Hold on.

55:23.580 --> 55:25.381
Not cool!

55:25.415 --> 55:26.583
Are you okay?

55:26.616 --> 55:27.951
- Yeah.
- For sure.

55:29.385 --> 55:31.654
Yeah. Wait.
Wait, look out!

55:40.863 --> 55:42.599
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

55:42.632 --> 55:43.933
Everyone okay?

55:43.967 --> 55:46.402
It came out of nowhere.

56:02.619 --> 56:05.822
I don't remember writing
about a giant green praying mantis.

56:07.690 --> 56:08.958
Right. Now I remember.

56:08.992 --> 56:12.095
Get us out of here!

56:12.128 --> 56:14.998
- What are you doing?
- Well, I can't drive if I can't see.

56:15.031 --> 56:16.966
Just go!

56:29.646 --> 56:31.648
Oh, my God!

56:31.681 --> 56:32.982
- Watch out!
- Turn left!

56:33.016 --> 56:34.584
Stop driving straight!

56:34.617 --> 56:36.653
- He's catching up! Turn right!
- Step on it!

56:36.686 --> 56:39.889
Does someone else wanna drive?
'Cause I'll pull over right now.

57:32.108 --> 57:34.811
Why'd you have come up
with something so freaky?

57:34.844 --> 57:36.813
I just have a knack for it,
I guess.

57:38.081 --> 57:40.383
Oh, no. My Wagoneer.

57:41.784 --> 57:43.786
I had such low mileage on it.

57:43.820 --> 57:45.488
How far are we
from the high school?

57:45.521 --> 57:46.889
Not too far.

57:46.923 --> 57:48.524
We can cut through
the cemetery.

57:48.558 --> 57:49.759
I'm sorry, a cemetery?

57:49.792 --> 57:52.028
God, relax. The high school's
just past the woods.

57:52.061 --> 57:53.696
Wait, how do you know that?

57:53.730 --> 57:57.200
Uh, sometimes I get a little
stir-crazy and go exploring.

57:57.233 --> 57:59.869
- When?
- At night after you go to bed.

57:59.902 --> 58:02.505
- You're grounded.
- Oh, That is so unfair.

58:02.538 --> 58:04.907
- No, it's fair.
- Guys, You're both bringing up good points,

58:04.941 --> 58:06.642
but let's keep moving
while you argue.

58:06.676 --> 58:09.645
Sneaking off in the middle
of the night with strange boys.

58:09.679 --> 58:12.949
- Unbelievable.
- Shut it.

58:16.252 --> 58:18.154
Hey, hey, do you have a dollar
I could borrow?

58:18.187 --> 58:20.957
- What? No. Why?
- I'm parched.

58:20.990 --> 58:23.226
Well, just take one.
I'm sure they'll understand.

58:23.259 --> 58:24.761
Really? Ha!

58:24.794 --> 58:27.930
Lemonade, grape or strawberry?

58:27.964 --> 58:30.833
Good God, man.
Here. Orange.

58:32.068 --> 58:34.003
I don't know what
I was thinking.

58:34.036 --> 58:36.239
There is way more going on here
than New York.

58:36.272 --> 58:38.574
- What?
- Uh, you cut yourself.

58:38.608 --> 58:41.778
- Is it bad?
- Uh, yeah. It's really bad.

58:41.811 --> 58:43.713
Is my face messed up?

58:43.746 --> 58:46.849
Yeah. Big time.

58:46.883 --> 58:48.684
You look exactly the same.

58:54.791 --> 58:56.125
Did you hear that?

59:56.686 --> 59:57.987
What are you doing?

59:58.020 --> 59:59.789
That's the Werewolf
of Fever Swamp.

59:59.822 --> 01:00:02.024
He can smell my scent.

01:00:09.031 --> 01:00:11.167
No, it's not working.
I have to hide.

01:00:18.975 --> 01:00:20.776
Come on.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.006
Shh, no, no, no.

01:00:53.009 --> 01:00:55.111
Do something.

01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:14.096
Come on, come on.
Come on.

01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:20.636
Come on. Go, go, go.

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:26.075
He's on our tail. Go.

01:01:27.176 --> 01:01:29.712
Go! He's right behind us!

01:01:34.016 --> 01:01:35.851
Come on. Go, go.

01:01:35.885 --> 01:01:38.120
Oh!

01:01:39.121 --> 01:01:41.290
I'm stuck. Help me get out.

01:01:41.324 --> 01:01:43.826
- What are you doing?
- There's no time!

01:01:43.859 --> 01:01:46.929
- I said get me out of here.
- Gotta go. There's no time.

01:01:46.963 --> 01:01:49.999
I said get me out... Oh, no.
Keep going. He's chasing us.

01:01:50.032 --> 01:01:51.767
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:57.373
- Just go. We're right behind you.
- Okay!

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.777
Aah! Oh!

01:02:01.811 --> 01:02:04.080
Come on. We gotta go.
Get up. Get up.

01:02:04.113 --> 01:02:05.448
- Come on, come on!
- Let's go, guys!

01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:08.084
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:09.185 --> 01:02:12.922
Ha! Let's see him
get through that.

01:02:15.124 --> 01:02:17.426
Go, go! Run, run!

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.810
- It's locked.
- This way.

01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:51.260
I'm okay.

01:02:51.293 --> 01:02:53.396
I'm still okay!

01:02:53.429 --> 01:02:55.464
- Who is that?
- It's my Aunt Lorraine.

01:02:56.932 --> 01:02:58.100
Oh, my gosh.

01:02:58.134 --> 01:02:59.468
I think I killed that bear.

01:02:59.502 --> 01:03:01.137
- It was actually a werewolf.
- What?

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.972
Aunt Lorraine,
what are you doing here?

01:03:03.005 --> 01:03:06.075
This is the back of my store.
I didn't know where else to go.

01:03:06.108 --> 01:03:10.179
I can't get ahold of your mother
or the cops or anyone...

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:12.448
- Hello.
- Uh, hi. Hello.

01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:16.419
Hi. I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

01:03:16.452 --> 01:03:19.121
Um... I'm... I'm Lorraine.

01:03:19.155 --> 01:03:20.856
Hello. R.L. Stine.

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:23.225
We owe you a great debt
of gratitude.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:25.161
Your reckless driving
saved our lives.

01:03:25.194 --> 01:03:26.829
Oh, that old thing?

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.331
Lorraine. Lorraine.

01:03:29.365 --> 01:03:31.000
- So...
- Lorraine.

01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:33.202
We don't have time.
I need you to go to the police

01:03:33.235 --> 01:03:34.937
and tell them to meet us
at the high school.

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:37.373
- All right? Can you do that?
- I can do that. Okay.

01:03:37.406 --> 01:03:39.241
Oh, did you wanna
exchange numbers?

01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:41.310
It's not a good time, but yes!

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:52.822
Oh, God, this is a bad idea.

01:03:52.855 --> 01:03:54.924
What was that?

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.168
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:04:06.202 --> 01:04:08.537
Yeah. Just a root.
Nothing scary here.

01:04:08.571 --> 01:04:11.040
So how did you get
the nickname "Champ"?

01:04:11.073 --> 01:04:12.808
It's not a nickname.

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:15.544
Wait. That's your real name?
Is it short for something?

01:04:15.578 --> 01:04:17.480
My full name is Champion.

01:04:17.513 --> 01:04:20.416
Your actual name is Champion.

01:04:21.851 --> 01:04:23.085
Sorry.

01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:24.420
My dad won a bronze

01:04:24.453 --> 01:04:27.089
- back in the '92 Olympics.
- Really?

01:04:29.058 --> 01:04:31.560
My mom, she was
an all-American sprinter

01:04:31.594 --> 01:04:34.096
and a two-time
world debate champion.

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.932
So they named me "Champ."

01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:42.071
Hey, you know, if you're scared,
I can hold your hand.

01:04:42.104 --> 01:04:44.373
Please, you're the scaredy-cat.

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:48.477
Wait, wait. Hold on.
It's okay. It's just a statue.

01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:49.845
All right? You're fine.

01:04:49.879 --> 01:04:52.848
It's all right. All right?

01:04:52.882 --> 01:04:55.951
Just give me a sec. It's...

01:04:55.985 --> 01:04:58.888
It's caught on your jacket.

01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:00.289
My hero.

01:05:03.492 --> 01:05:07.096
There. You're free to go.

01:05:26.148 --> 01:05:28.450
What is it?

01:05:30.152 --> 01:05:31.453
Nothing.

01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:33.889
Are you sure?

01:05:37.293 --> 01:05:39.028
Yeah.

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:41.230
Yeah, totally. I'm fi...

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.302
Zach!

01:05:55.044 --> 01:05:56.912
Run!

01:05:56.946 --> 01:05:59.114
Ghouls. Go, go.

01:06:06.088 --> 01:06:10.125
Oh, they're getting closer!

01:06:10.159 --> 01:06:12.695
Go. Here. Go. Go.
Come on. Come on. Go, go, go.

01:06:12.728 --> 01:06:15.431
Hurry, quick, quick, quick.

01:06:15.464 --> 01:06:17.132
I'm stuck.

01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:19.435
- Go on without me. Save yourself.
- Okay. Good luck.

01:06:19.468 --> 01:06:23.105
No, I didn't mean it, Champion!

01:06:23.138 --> 01:06:25.441
What kind of monster
would take me up on that offer?

01:06:25.474 --> 01:06:29.144
Pull. Everybody pull.

01:06:29.178 --> 01:06:32.514
I'll kill him.
Where is that little imbecile?

01:06:34.483 --> 01:06:36.685
Wait for us, you coward!

01:06:36.719 --> 01:06:39.521
All right. Okay, Lorraine.
You got this.

01:06:39.555 --> 01:06:41.457
Just tell the cops to head
to the high school

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:43.359
and that everyone's
in trouble.

01:06:43.392 --> 01:06:45.227
You can do this. Okay.

01:06:45.261 --> 01:06:47.563
Oh! Nope. Wrong door.

01:06:49.698 --> 01:06:51.500
Hello?

01:06:52.635 --> 01:06:55.204
Is anyone in here?

01:06:57.072 --> 01:07:00.042
Calling all cops,
calling all the cops.

01:07:00.075 --> 01:07:02.278
Head to the high school.
My nephew's in trouble.

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:03.579
He's with R.L. Stine.

01:07:03.612 --> 01:07:05.648
They think they know
how to stop all this.

01:07:05.681 --> 01:07:08.317
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:11.620
I can hear you.

01:07:11.654 --> 01:07:15.357
Sergeant Slappy,
ready to protect and serve.

01:07:15.391 --> 01:07:17.726
Oh, my goodness.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.361
- You're...
- Don't do it.

01:07:19.395 --> 01:07:21.230
- A talking...
- Don't say it.

01:07:21.263 --> 01:07:23.732
- Dummy.
- You said it.

01:07:29.138 --> 01:07:33.042
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:07:33.075 --> 01:07:34.643
Where did they put
my typewriter?

01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:37.479
I know it was this way.
It might've been the other way.

01:07:37.513 --> 01:07:39.048
- We should split up.
- What? No.

01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:40.649
Have you ever read
one of your books?

01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:42.151
We're never supposed
to split up.

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:46.155
Come on. How many display cases
could there be?

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:50.693
- You're touching me.
- Yeah. Hang on a second.

01:07:50.726 --> 01:07:53.262
- Hannah doesn't know, does she?
- She doesn't know what?

01:07:53.295 --> 01:07:55.631
That she's not real.

01:07:58.801 --> 01:08:00.636
She thinks she's a person, okay?

01:08:00.669 --> 01:08:02.738
Not just some figment
of your imagination.

01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:04.440
How could...
How could you lie to her?

01:08:04.473 --> 01:08:05.774
I was trying to protect her!

01:08:05.808 --> 01:08:08.744
Oh, yeah?
Well, good job with that.

01:08:08.777 --> 01:08:10.713
This gift of mine is a curse.

01:08:10.746 --> 01:08:14.416
You have no idea how lonely
it's been until Hannah.

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:16.719
She's different.

01:08:16.752 --> 01:08:19.254
I wrote her in such a way
that she thinks she's real,

01:08:19.287 --> 01:08:22.658
and she is real to me, Zach.

01:08:25.361 --> 01:08:28.130
I don't expect you
to understand.

01:08:29.665 --> 01:08:32.134
Actually, I do.

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:38.140
I'm afraid of losing her.

01:08:40.776 --> 01:08:43.312
And the truth is,
I'm afraid of being alone.

01:08:43.345 --> 01:08:45.581
I suppose I stopped connecting
with real people

01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:47.750
when I was your age.

01:08:50.618 --> 01:08:54.288
After my dad died,
I shut everyone out too.

01:08:55.691 --> 01:08:59.361
Maybe we can both start over,

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:01.764
if we're alive tomorrow.

01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:07.870
There you are.
Are you okay?

01:09:07.903 --> 01:09:11.305
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.643
Okay. Well, come on.
We found the typewriter.

01:09:17.345 --> 01:09:21.283
Oh, my sweet darling,
I've missed you so much. Mwah.

01:09:22.684 --> 01:09:24.353
All right, so start writing.

01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:26.755
Yes, but what's the story?

01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:29.558
What do you mean? Monsters lose,
good guys win, the end.

01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:31.126
No, no, no.
It doesn't work

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.728
unless it's a real
Goosebumps story,

01:09:32.761 --> 01:09:35.363
with twists and turns
and frights.

01:09:35.397 --> 01:09:38.233
Not to mention some personal
growth for our hero.

01:09:38.267 --> 01:09:39.635
What?

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:41.203
Go to the gym. Warn everyone.

01:09:41.236 --> 01:09:42.671
Tell them to barricade
the school.

01:09:42.703 --> 01:09:43.872
Where are you going?

01:09:43.906 --> 01:09:45.541
To find someplace to write.

01:09:45.573 --> 01:09:46.742
Slappy's going
to come for me.

01:09:46.774 --> 01:09:48.377
I have a deadline, literally.

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.446
Now go.

01:09:53.282 --> 01:09:54.850
Unbelievable.

01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:56.585
♪ Off, off, off ♪

01:09:56.618 --> 01:09:59.288
♪ Off with your head ♪

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:02.758

01:10:11.567 --> 01:10:13.735
Sorry. Coming through.

01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:15.737
Come on. We gotta get
to the stage.

01:10:18.307 --> 01:10:21.710

Heads will roll? ♪

01:10:21.743 --> 01:10:24.379

01:10:27.282 --> 01:10:29.384
So this is what
a high-school dance is like.

01:10:29.418 --> 01:10:33.689
Uh, yeah.
Usually the dancing's better.

01:10:33.722 --> 01:10:35.224
But you get the idea.

01:10:39.761 --> 01:10:41.530
That what they call dancing now?

01:10:41.563 --> 01:10:43.932
- I'm not sure.
- Zach.

01:10:43.966 --> 01:10:45.734
- Mom. Mom.
- Zach.

01:10:45.767 --> 01:10:47.970
I was so worried. I couldn't
get hold of you or Lorraine.

01:10:48.003 --> 01:10:49.972
I know. I know.
Mom, everyone here is in danger.

01:10:50.005 --> 01:10:53.308
- We have to barricade the school.
- Oh, no, Zach. Not this again.

01:10:53.342 --> 01:10:55.978
He's telling you the truth.
I'm Hannah. I live next door.

01:10:56.011 --> 01:10:58.247
All right.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.983
Okay, everyone,
listen up. Okay?

01:11:01.016 --> 01:11:03.585
Okay. Everybody,
you gotta listen up...

01:11:03.619 --> 01:11:05.754
Champ, get down.
I have something to say.

01:11:05.787 --> 01:11:08.457
Uh... wow.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:10.592
Okay, um...

01:11:10.626 --> 01:11:12.461
Uh, okay, uh...

01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:14.363
Listen to my best friend Zach.

01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:16.565
- Just... Just tell them.
- Thanks, Champ.

01:11:16.598 --> 01:11:18.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right. Um...

01:11:20.869 --> 01:11:22.604
This is going
to sound insane,

01:11:22.638 --> 01:11:26.508
but monsters
have invaded Madison.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:29.645
Guys, it's the truth. Okay?

01:11:29.678 --> 01:11:31.513
He's telling the truth. It's...

01:11:31.547 --> 01:11:33.282
He's not making this up.

01:11:33.315 --> 01:11:35.317
They've blocked every road
out of town,

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:37.419
they've torn down
the cell towers,

01:11:37.452 --> 01:11:41.690
and we've been cut off
from the rest of the world.

01:11:41.723 --> 01:11:43.825
And they could be coming for us
any second,

01:11:43.859 --> 01:11:45.427
so we need to work to...

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.496
Aah! He's right.

01:11:47.529 --> 01:11:51.800
It's the Boogeyman.
And he's picking his nose.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.741
- I'm not making...
- Aah!

01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:01.376
There's a giant bug,

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.312
and it's eating
everybody's cars!

01:12:03.345 --> 01:12:06.048
- Uh, it's getting old, dude.
- No, seriously!

01:12:12.888 --> 01:12:15.657
They're here.

01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:17.759
Whoa.

01:12:20.596 --> 01:12:22.064
Ha, ha!

01:12:22.097 --> 01:12:24.800
Now, this is a real
homecoming.

01:12:36.378 --> 01:12:38.714
All right. Everyone, everyone,
everyone calm down. Okay?

01:12:38.747 --> 01:12:42.851
I know... I know what to do,
but I can't do it by myself.

01:12:42.884 --> 01:12:44.419
Take this.

01:12:44.453 --> 01:12:47.456
Invite the rest of our friends
to the party.

01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:55.831
Look. Those things out there,

01:12:55.864 --> 01:12:57.833
they're R.L. Stine's monsters.

01:12:57.866 --> 01:12:59.434
He's here, and he can fix this,

01:12:59.468 --> 01:13:01.436
but we need to buy him
time to write.

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:03.839
And don't worry,
he's a very quick writer.

01:13:03.872 --> 01:13:08.410
The night was cold.

01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:11.880
Cold was the night.

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:24.926
Come close. Don't be shy.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.830
You don't wanna
miss the show.

01:13:32.634 --> 01:13:34.870
All right, everyone.
These are all the exits.

01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:36.838
Find anything you can
to barricade the doors,

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:38.573
because we cannot let
the monsters inside. Alright?

01:13:38.607 --> 01:13:40.442
Come on, guys.
We don't have a lot of time.

01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:42.044
Stack them up there.
Stack them up.

01:13:42.077 --> 01:13:44.746
Come on, quickly.
Quickly. Yes.

01:13:51.787 --> 01:13:54.656
All my friends in one place.

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.792
I've never been so happy.

01:13:56.825 --> 01:13:59.161
I don't want
this day to end.

01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:02.064
And it doesn't have to...

01:14:02.097 --> 01:14:06.101
as long as we get rid
of Stine.

01:14:06.134 --> 01:14:07.102
Charge!

01:14:07.135 --> 01:14:09.538
Woo-hoo!

01:14:37.065 --> 01:14:40.569
Go, go, go!
It's not gonna hold! Go!

01:14:40.602 --> 01:14:42.170
Go, go, go!

01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:49.811
We come in peace.

01:14:49.845 --> 01:14:52.114
We come in peace.

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:04.459
- We should be helping.
- We should be leaving.

01:15:07.696 --> 01:15:10.031
Uh... whoa.

01:15:10.065 --> 01:15:11.933
What? What?

01:15:11.967 --> 01:15:13.702
Where are you going?

01:15:13.735 --> 01:15:16.004
We are so... through.

01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:24.646
Please, no. Please.

01:15:25.747 --> 01:15:27.916
No, please.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:53.241
Oh, my God.
How'd you do that?

01:15:53.275 --> 01:15:55.243
Oh, um...

01:15:55.277 --> 01:15:57.512
Silver fillings.
I have a ton of cavities.

01:15:57.546 --> 01:16:00.015
When I was 10, I didn't brush
my teeth for a whole year.

01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:04.853
Ugh, werewolf hair. Oh.

01:16:08.023 --> 01:16:09.858
You saved my life, Chump.

01:16:09.891 --> 01:16:11.726
It's actually "Champ."

01:16:21.102 --> 01:16:23.271
I was just gonna say
"Hug me again,"

01:16:23.305 --> 01:16:26.041
but yeah, yeah, that works too.

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:37.052
We can't keep this up.
There's too many.

01:16:37.085 --> 01:16:39.120
We have to get to Stine.

01:16:39.154 --> 01:16:40.889
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:16:40.922 --> 01:16:43.792
All the monsters had converged.

01:16:43.825 --> 01:16:46.661
The vicious vampire bats,

01:16:46.695 --> 01:16:48.897
the praying mantis,

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:50.565
the haunted mask...

01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:52.601
Forgetting somebody?

01:16:52.634 --> 01:16:53.768
Slappy.

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:56.338
How did you find me?

01:16:58.206 --> 01:17:00.642
I know you. I created you.

01:17:00.675 --> 01:17:02.844
Or is it
the other way around?

01:17:02.878 --> 01:17:05.046
I always forget.
We're so similar.

01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:07.782
Slappy?

01:17:07.816 --> 01:17:10.085
Slappy?

01:17:10.118 --> 01:17:11.786
Slappy?

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.688
- Slappy?
- Hi.

01:17:16.024 --> 01:17:18.159
"Everyone in the high school

01:17:18.193 --> 01:17:22.063
joined forces to defeat
Slappy and his monsters."

01:17:22.097 --> 01:17:26.301
Hmm. But Slappy
had other ideas.

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:27.302
No.

01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.073
Dad!

01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:36.244
Are you okay?

01:17:36.278 --> 01:17:37.846
That dumb dummy
broke my fingers.

01:17:37.879 --> 01:17:39.915
I was almost finished.
Only one or two pages left.

01:17:39.948 --> 01:17:42.384
Well, forget two pages.
Write two words: "The End."

01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:44.252
It doesn't work like that.

01:17:44.286 --> 01:17:46.354
School-wide announcement:

01:17:46.388 --> 01:17:48.056
Monsters have overwhelmed
Madison High.

01:17:48.089 --> 01:17:50.792
Retreat in an orderly fashion
to the storage room.

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:53.828
I repeat, retreat in an orderly
fashion to the storage room.

01:17:58.366 --> 01:18:00.869
We'll figure this out later,
all right?

01:18:00.902 --> 01:18:02.370
- Let's go.
- Follow me.

01:18:03.705 --> 01:18:05.607
Come on, go!

01:18:12.047 --> 01:18:15.083
- Aah!
- Hannah. No.

01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:23.358
Close it. Close it.

01:18:38.306 --> 01:18:40.942
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

01:18:40.976 --> 01:18:42.210
Come with me.

01:18:42.243 --> 01:18:44.813
Wait. Wait, she's a...

01:18:44.846 --> 01:18:46.314
Yes, and I don't care.

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:07.469
All right. Come on, come on,
come on. Go, go, go.

01:19:07.502 --> 01:19:09.771
Shut it! Go!

01:19:09.804 --> 01:19:12.874
Get that door! Get it! Get it!

01:19:12.907 --> 01:19:14.075
Oh, God.

01:19:14.109 --> 01:19:15.810
Oh, God.

01:19:15.844 --> 01:19:18.013
Wait. Mom, Mom, Mom.
You okay?

01:19:18.046 --> 01:19:20.215
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:20.248 --> 01:19:21.750
Zach, Zach, What are we gonna do?
They'll get through.

01:19:21.783 --> 01:19:23.218
I don't know. I don't know.

01:19:23.251 --> 01:19:24.986
Slappy wants me.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.821
That's who he's after.

01:19:26.855 --> 01:19:29.090
Listen to me, if I can lure them
away in one of those buses,

01:19:29.124 --> 01:19:31.393
I know that they'll follow me
and you'll all be safe.

01:19:31.426 --> 01:19:33.828
- I'm coming with you.
- Hannah, No, I need to do this alone.

01:19:33.862 --> 01:19:36.097
I've been running away
from people my whole life.

01:19:36.131 --> 01:19:37.371
I was so angry
at the real world

01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:39.834
that I created
these terrible monsters.

01:19:39.868 --> 01:19:41.369
Hold that door down.

01:19:41.403 --> 01:19:42.971
But I'm not mad anymore.

01:19:43.004 --> 01:19:45.974
It's my fault, not this town's.
Not yours.

01:19:46.007 --> 01:19:48.743
- Then there's gotta be another way.
- Hannah, sweetheart,

01:19:48.777 --> 01:19:51.413
it's time for me
to face my demons.

01:19:51.446 --> 01:19:53.214
- I believe in you.
- Shut up!

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:56.284
I'm sorry.
I mean, shut up.

01:20:01.356 --> 01:20:04.225
I have an idea.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.341
Oh, Papa.

01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:23.211
There's no escaping from us.

01:20:25.113 --> 01:20:27.282
Bring him to me.

01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:29.878
Did it work?

01:21:31.646 --> 01:21:33.081
Not yet.

01:21:33.114 --> 01:21:35.049
Come on. Come on, work.

01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:36.317
Come on, come on.

01:21:43.057 --> 01:21:44.459
Uh-oh.

01:21:50.098 --> 01:21:52.200
Yes!

01:21:52.233 --> 01:21:53.368
High five.

01:21:53.401 --> 01:21:55.870
- Oh, boy. Bad idea.
- Sorry.

01:21:58.139 --> 01:22:00.408
Yes. It worked.

01:22:00.441 --> 01:22:02.243
Oh, be careful, Zach.

01:22:03.444 --> 01:22:05.113
We're gonna get
through this.

01:22:05.146 --> 01:22:06.281
Not a good time.

01:22:06.314 --> 01:22:08.349
Okay.

01:22:12.453 --> 01:22:14.956
Okay. Go.

01:22:16.691 --> 01:22:19.594
Okay, it was clear there
was only one place left to hide.

01:22:19.627 --> 01:22:22.130
- I can't type while walking.
- Then commit it to memory.

01:22:22.163 --> 01:22:24.999
There was one place to hide.
It was the, uh, Arcade Gallery.

01:22:25.033 --> 01:22:26.334
There is no Arcade Gallery.

01:22:26.367 --> 01:22:29.470
Okay. That was, in fact,
the Funhouse!

01:22:29.504 --> 01:22:32.507
Wait, guys. Why don't we just
sit at one of these tables?

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:35.076
Come on. Guys!

01:22:44.185 --> 01:22:46.054
Follow the scent.

01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:48.623
Lead me to Stine.

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:05.540
Stine's ingenious plan
worked to perfection.

01:23:05.573 --> 01:23:07.542
The funhouse was terrifying.

01:23:07.575 --> 01:23:09.510
Not so much for Stine
as it was for the others.

01:23:09.544 --> 01:23:11.980
But it offered refuge from
the real terrors

01:23:12.013 --> 01:23:13.181
that lurked outside.

01:23:13.214 --> 01:23:15.316
You wish.

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:18.686
He found us.
Quickly, follow me.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.025
Papa, you left
without saying goodbye.

01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:25.593
Trying to hide from me?

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:28.062
That's like hiding
from yourself.

01:23:28.096 --> 01:23:32.333
I was your best friend,
and you turned your back on me.

01:23:32.367 --> 01:23:37.071
Locked me up, imprisoned me
in the pages of a book.

01:23:37.105 --> 01:23:41.609
You stuck me on a shelf
for years and years.

01:23:41.643 --> 01:23:44.212
The key was right there.

01:23:44.245 --> 01:23:46.114
And you never used it.

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:49.417
You're not real, Slappy.
I created you.

01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:52.287
I can write you out.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.090
I've been saving this monster
just for you.

01:23:56.124 --> 01:23:59.627
- Say hello to my gelatinous friend.
- Run!

01:24:02.797 --> 01:24:07.101
It's The Blob That Ate Everyone.
Don't let it touch you.

01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:12.040
We need to get to higher ground.

01:24:12.073 --> 01:24:13.608
The Ferris wheel.

01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:20.114
Zach, you go on ahead.
I'll hold it off.

01:24:20.148 --> 01:24:21.249
You finish the book.

01:24:21.282 --> 01:24:23.217
What? What do I write?

01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:25.787
- What's the end?
- It's the story I've been writing.

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.257
It's what's happening right now.
You can do this. End it.

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:31.492
Wait.

01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:53.247
Dad!

01:24:54.816 --> 01:24:56.818
Hannah, he's gonna be okay,
all right?

01:24:56.851 --> 01:24:58.386
We have to finish the book.

01:24:58.419 --> 01:25:00.488
Okay.

01:25:07.628 --> 01:25:11.032
Not so fun, is it?

01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:15.536
Here we go.

01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.438
Okay.

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.441
How do you like it, Papa?

01:25:20.475 --> 01:25:25.146
The world is just outside
your grasp, but you can't move.

01:25:25.179 --> 01:25:27.215
You're trapped.

01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:31.452
That's what it felt like
to be locked inside your books.

01:25:31.486 --> 01:25:35.556
Wait. The book.
Where is it?

01:25:39.494 --> 01:25:42.263
As the monsters converged,

01:25:42.296 --> 01:25:43.765
Zach closed his eyes,

01:25:43.798 --> 01:25:45.600
and the monsters
were swallowed

01:25:45.633 --> 01:25:47.735
back into the world
of paper and ink.

01:25:47.769 --> 01:25:49.704
- Can you type any faster?
- Uh, This is my first time

01:25:49.737 --> 01:25:51.339
- using a typewriter.
- Keep going.

01:25:55.743 --> 01:25:59.113
Eureka, eureka, 23-69...

01:26:01.282 --> 01:26:03.151
They're coming.
What are we gonna do?

01:26:03.184 --> 01:26:04.685
Finish it, Zach.

01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:06.220
One by one,

01:26:06.254 --> 01:26:08.356
the monsters disappeared

01:26:08.389 --> 01:26:10.558
back into the book,

01:26:10.591 --> 01:26:12.560
never to be seen...

01:26:15.263 --> 01:26:17.799
again. The end.

01:26:17.832 --> 01:26:19.767
- Here.
- What happens now?

01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:21.602
We're about to find out.

01:26:37.418 --> 01:26:40.254
We're all gonna die!

01:26:42.957 --> 01:26:45.226
Just hold on!

01:26:45.259 --> 01:26:47.361
Hold on tight!

01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:52.667
Where's the seat belt
in this thing?

01:27:06.714 --> 01:27:07.849
Let's go.

01:27:07.882 --> 01:27:09.584
Right.

01:27:11.619 --> 01:27:13.821
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:27:13.855 --> 01:27:16.824
Okay. Hurry up. All the monsters
will be here any second.

01:27:19.293 --> 01:27:20.328
All the monsters.

01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:21.929
What? Wait.
What are you waiting for?

01:27:21.963 --> 01:27:24.765
Come on, open the book.

01:27:24.799 --> 01:27:27.768
Hannah, there's something
that you need to know,

01:27:27.802 --> 01:27:29.704
- and you're not gonna...
- Open the book, Zach.

01:27:29.737 --> 01:27:30.905
No, no.
You don't understand.

01:27:30.938 --> 01:27:32.607
If we open the book,
that means...

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.943
It means I'll be stuck
on a shelf someplace forever.

01:27:37.478 --> 01:27:38.713
You knew?

01:27:38.746 --> 01:27:41.349
How many sweet sixteens
can one girl have?

01:27:42.917 --> 01:27:45.786
Zach, it's time to move on.

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.557
Now open the book,
scaredy-cat.

01:27:51.993 --> 01:27:54.662
No.

01:27:54.695 --> 01:27:56.964
- Okay. Then I'll open it.
- Wait, no. Hannah!

01:28:09.644 --> 01:28:11.746
Wait, Hannah.
I've got you.

01:28:54.822 --> 01:28:56.891
Maybe if I hold on to you
tight enough...

01:28:56.924 --> 01:28:59.393
You have to let go, Zach.

01:29:14.675 --> 01:29:16.277
Whoa!

01:29:27.555 --> 01:29:29.690
Slappy's not happy!

01:29:29.724 --> 01:29:31.726
Neither is Stine!

01:29:31.759 --> 01:29:34.795
Stupid dummy!

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:38.933
See you in your dreams!

01:29:44.405 --> 01:29:45.806
You'll be okay.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.109
I'll always be
in your imagination,

01:29:48.142 --> 01:29:50.077
which is really
where I belong.

01:29:50.111 --> 01:29:53.581
I'm just sad we never
got to share a dance.

01:30:02.156 --> 01:30:03.557
Wait.

01:31:13.828 --> 01:31:16.030
Yeah. One more coat,
we should be good.

01:31:16.063 --> 01:31:19.133
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:19.166 --> 01:31:22.870
Welcome back to class, guys.
All right. Welcome back.

01:31:22.903 --> 01:31:26.107
Hey. Watch it.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.509
Back to business. Let's go.

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:46.427
Okay. I'll give you
a 60-second head start.

01:31:47.895 --> 01:31:51.665
It's okay, Mom.
Let's go in together.

01:31:57.571 --> 01:31:58.873
So mature.

01:31:58.906 --> 01:32:00.241
You love it.

01:32:00.274 --> 01:32:01.942
Maybe after fourth period.

01:32:01.976 --> 01:32:03.644
Oh, okay.
That would be great.

01:32:15.022 --> 01:32:17.191
You okay? You breathing?
You're gonna be great.

01:32:17.224 --> 01:32:19.860
Okay? You look great.
You smell great.

01:32:19.894 --> 01:32:21.262
My God, what is that?

01:32:21.295 --> 01:32:25.065
I rub myself in cilantro
every morning.

01:32:25.099 --> 01:32:26.867
Of course you do,
my sexy little salsa.

01:32:26.901 --> 01:32:28.102
Go on.

01:32:28.135 --> 01:32:29.603
Okay. I'm off to work.

01:32:29.637 --> 01:32:31.739
Oh, what did I have for you?

01:32:31.772 --> 01:32:33.774
There it is.

01:32:33.808 --> 01:32:37.011
Oh. Oh. Went too far.
Got it.

01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:51.892
Hello. Ahem.

01:32:51.926 --> 01:32:54.595
My name is Mr. R. L. Stine,

01:32:54.628 --> 01:32:57.164
and I will be your new
English teacher,

01:32:57.198 --> 01:32:59.600
because Mr. Boyd is still
recuperating from injuries

01:32:59.633 --> 01:33:04.772
sustained in a
mutant-insect attack.

01:33:04.805 --> 01:33:07.174
Now...

01:33:08.676 --> 01:33:10.611
every story ever told

01:33:10.644 --> 01:33:14.982
can be broken down
into three distinct parts.

01:33:15.015 --> 01:33:16.917
The beginning,

01:33:16.951 --> 01:33:19.753
The middle

01:33:19.787 --> 01:33:20.921
and The twist.

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:25.559
- Hello, Mr. Stine.
- Hello, Mr. Black.

01:33:26.694 --> 01:33:27.795
Uh, who was that?

01:33:27.828 --> 01:33:30.097
He's the new
drama teacher.

01:33:33.234 --> 01:33:36.303
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

01:33:38.939 --> 01:33:40.207
Do you miss her?

01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:42.643
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of her.

01:33:42.676 --> 01:33:45.646
But she'll always
be in here...

01:33:45.679 --> 01:33:48.082
and in there.

01:33:48.115 --> 01:33:50.684
And right here...

01:33:50.718 --> 01:33:52.353
and in here.

01:33:52.386 --> 01:33:54.555
And also right over there.

01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:06.667
I may have written
one more book.

01:34:15.409 --> 01:34:16.744
Hannah.

01:34:20.147 --> 01:34:22.116
You're... You're real.

01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:23.250
You came back.

01:34:23.284 --> 01:34:25.252
I had to.
You owe me a dance.

01:34:33.027 --> 01:34:35.629
Come on, let's go.

01:35:14.802 --> 01:35:17.004
You forgot about me.

01:35:21.571 --> 01:40:00.371
