WEBVTT

00:02.802 --> 00:05.498
Ooh, looking good, Al.

00:05.572 --> 00:09.941
Thank you. I've been experimenting
with those new volumizing shampoos.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.739
- Mm-hmm.
- Now I've got fluff!

00:14.314 --> 00:15.474
Oh, guess what?

00:15.548 --> 00:17.413
I ran into llene
at the health club.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.510
- I am so happy for her.
- Happy about what?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.282
- Havert heard the news?
- What?

00:22.355 --> 00:26.291
- Nothing, nothing.
- Heidi, come on, come on.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.817
- Come on, what news?
- Al, she's engaged.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.096
- What?
- You know, I could've heard it wrong.

00:33.199 --> 00:36.635
- I...
- Oh, boy, engaged?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.671
That happened so fast.

00:38.738 --> 00:39.898
She...

00:40.673 --> 00:42.971
Ilene's changed her
whole life around.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.670
And, and... I've done...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.246
...nothing.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.606
But, your hair looks so good.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.319
Does everybody know
what time it is?

00:54.387 --> 00:57.288
<i>- Tool Time!
- That's right!</i>

00:57.357 --> 00:59.120
Binford Tools is proud to present,

00:59.225 --> 01:02.319
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, whoo!

01:08.968 --> 01:11.027
Thank you, Heidi.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.732
<i>Thank you, studio audience,
welcome to Tool Time.</i>

01:13.807 --> 01:16.571
I am who I am,

01:16.643 --> 01:19.771
I am Tim "The Tool Man."

01:21.181 --> 01:24.639
And, of course you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.754
Today we're talking
about sharpening tools,

01:31.825 --> 01:35.989
'cause as we all know,
a dull tool is a useless tool.

01:36.996 --> 01:40.295
And nobody wants a dull, useless tool.

01:44.871 --> 01:47.806
So what do they do?
They just replace it with a...

01:47.874 --> 01:51.366
...more exciting,
probably better looking tool.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.440
Or they sharpen it.

01:57.884 --> 02:01.047
Which is what Al and I will do today,
showing you how to sharpen

02:01.121 --> 02:04.056
with this professional
knife-sharpening system...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.558
Al? Got a minute?

02:08.026 --> 02:10.860
Got the whole rest of my life.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.167
It'll just be me,
all alone with my tools.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.736
A guy could do worse.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.773
Let's start with garden tools, can we?

02:20.840 --> 02:23.968
The simplest way to do that
is use a two grit whetstone. Al?

02:25.311 --> 02:26.335
Huh?

02:28.081 --> 02:31.642
What's the matter with you?
Are you on that all-corn diet again?

02:34.187 --> 02:38.556
Uh, to sharpen your garden tool,
you'll wanna...

02:39.092 --> 02:41.322
...take the whetstone, uh,

02:41.394 --> 02:43.089
across the surface of the blade,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.290
in strong, smooth strokes,

02:45.365 --> 02:48.300
following the,
the curve of the blade.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.570
In a former life,
Al was a motivational speaker.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.478
Let's talk about knives,

03:00.547 --> 03:03.710
these are chef's knives,
stainless steel with carbon in them.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.113
They're very expensive,

03:05.185 --> 03:07.449
so a good rule is not to use
too much pressure.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.748
Pressure must be exact.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.722
Well, what do you know
about pressure? You know.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.487
I'm almost 40
and I'm still single.

03:14.561 --> 03:18.190
You keep this up,
you'll be 40, single and unemployed.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.502
As I said, these knives are pricey,
you want to pay attention, Al.

03:26.573 --> 03:27.904
I know what I'm doing.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.737
I'm just saying, with proper care,

03:29.842 --> 03:33.005
these tools can always be
a precision cutting instrument.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074

04:33.706 --> 04:35.173
Great show, everyone.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.936
Almost.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.778
Al, what's the matter with you?

04:40.146 --> 04:42.774
I just found out
llene is engaged.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.340
Ooh, that's the problem. Oh.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.387
- I thought you were over her.
- I am.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.014
But, the point is,
she's moved on.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.558
She's... found somebody else.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.762
All I've done is switched
to a shampoo with jojoba.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.300
What do you expect, a woman
to pop out of a Prell bottle?

05:03.069 --> 05:05.799
Al, you're a bouncir and behavir guy.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.238
- You just gotta get out more.
- Well, I get out.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.800
Heck, I'm over at your house
twice this week for dinner.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.872
I mean get out and meet some women,
get back in the saddle.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.314
- You're right.
- I know I'm right.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.874
- What am I waiting for?
- What?

05:19.952 --> 05:21.476
- Back in that saddle!
- Saddle!

05:21.554 --> 05:22.919
- Back on that horse!
- Horse!

05:23.022 --> 05:24.990
Lasso that future Mrs. Borland.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.752
Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay!

05:28.461 --> 05:31.362
Howdy! You wanna go out
Saturday night?

05:46.479 --> 05:48.140
So, whers dinner?

05:48.948 --> 05:52.315
6:15, same time it's been
every night this week.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.381
Al, um, werert you supposed
to have a date tonight?

05:58.991 --> 06:00.856
Well, it wasrt really a date.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.687
This lady selling Amway
said she might call back.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.823
Wow.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.069
Shouldrt you be home,
waiting for the call?

06:15.007 --> 06:17.134
No, I gave her this number.

06:19.145 --> 06:22.239
And if she doesn't call back,
that's alright too.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.850
'Cause I'm here with the people I love
and people who love me.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.987
Borland, you still here?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.354
Boys, dinner's here!

06:32.592 --> 06:35.493
So, chicken, huh?
Uh-oh!

06:35.561 --> 06:37.859
You always forget
the moist towelettes.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.426
Do I? Where is my mind?

06:42.502 --> 06:45.733
Not to worry, I got some
emergency towelettes in the car.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.933
Emergency towelettes...

06:50.009 --> 06:52.239
...and he can't get a date?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.404
- Chicken.
- Oh, no.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.848
- You know how much Al likes chicken.
- Al likes anything.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.715
Just hide the drumsticks
so we don't all starve.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.751
Tim, this is ridiculous. He can't just
spend all of his free time here.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.658
I've got a paper due Friday,
I can't get any work done.

07:08.728 --> 07:09.956
He's driving us nuts.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.998
He keeps following me around,
asking me how I meet women.

07:16.135 --> 07:19.036
Amazing. A grown man
as desperate as Mark.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.640
I've got to find him a woman.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.938
Why doesn't he go on the internet?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.569
He tried that.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.309
He ended up having coffee with
a 60-year-old stripper named Vince.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.113
Got the towelettes!

07:36.189 --> 07:38.214
I also found some packets of hot sauce

07:38.291 --> 07:40.987
in case tomorrow night we go
"south of the border."

07:45.364 --> 07:46.422
Al...

07:46.499 --> 07:49.400
...it's not that we don't love you
coming over for dinner

07:49.469 --> 07:52.233
- night after night after night.
- After night.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.102
But, um, I was thinking
that maybe, I don't know,

07:55.174 --> 07:57.699
you could go out
into the dating world again.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.803
Have you ever considered
going to, like, a singles bar?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.814
Oh, I tried that once.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.851
I spent the whole night
alone at the bar...

08:05.952 --> 08:08.887
...building a fort
out of swizzle sticks.

08:08.955 --> 08:12.118
Well, Al, you can't go
to a singles bar by yourself.

08:12.191 --> 08:16.355
You need to take a friend with you, that
way you feel more relaxed and confident.

08:16.462 --> 08:19.431
- I don't have any single friends.
- What about Wilson?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.531
- How about Benny?
- No, no, no, no.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.968
We wanna attract women,
not repel them.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.068
Well, OK, then, then,
just take a married friend, take Tim.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.733
Excuse me?

08:31.310 --> 08:35.076
Yeah, Tim would be willing
to go bar-hopping with you tonight.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.082
- I would?
- That's great! Alright!

08:38.150 --> 08:40.982
Hey, hold on a minute,
excuse me a second.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.022
Back the open marriage mobile up, OK?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.818
You want me to go out
and look for women?

08:46.893 --> 08:48.793
Well... oh, either that or

08:48.861 --> 08:51.762
we could just have Al here
for dinner every night

08:51.831 --> 08:53.128
for the rest of our lives.

08:53.199 --> 08:57.363
Dad, if you love your family, you'll go
to the singles bar, cruise for chicks.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.499
Tim, you gotta hurry up and get to the
bar before all the good women are taken.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.134
OK.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.608
Arert you the least bit worried
some woman might fall for me?

09:10.683 --> 09:12.913
No.

09:13.953 --> 09:17.389
You're only gonna be there long enough
for Al to meet somebody.

09:17.456 --> 09:21.119
That's not long enough for anybody
to fall... you gonna wear this tie?

09:21.193 --> 09:23.718
What's the matter with this tie?

09:23.796 --> 09:27.698
Well, it's fine for business, but it's
no good if you wanna get some action.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.602
I'm not looking to get any "action".

09:31.671 --> 09:34.731
I know, but Al is and
you're supposed to be part of a team.

09:34.807 --> 09:38.573
You gotta go upstairs and change
your pants. Wear those black jeans.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.008
- The tight ones?
- Oh, yeah.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.679
You gotta show off that butt, you know?

09:45.751 --> 09:48.720
- Why would I show off my butt?
- For Al!

09:50.756 --> 09:53.122
I'm beginning to think
going after another woman

09:53.225 --> 09:55.193
wouldn't be that bad of an idea.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.689
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, well, OK.

09:57.763 --> 10:02.029
You don't trust me, we'll just go
get a totally objective opinion, OK?

10:02.101 --> 10:05.730
OK, Tim, spin for your neighbor
one more time.

10:05.805 --> 10:08.706
What do you think? He's going out.
I want him to look good.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.004
She says I should wear
tighter pants for Al,

10:11.077 --> 10:12.908
I say I look fine,
what do you say?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.470
Well, how does Al
like his men to dress?

10:17.883 --> 10:19.976
It's not for Al,
it's for the single women

10:20.052 --> 10:22.486
they're hoping to pick up
at the singles bar.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.922
Oh, silly me,
how could I have missed that?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.516
- It's not as bad as it sounds.
- I hope not.

10:28.594 --> 10:32.086
Al's been really lonely, he's
hanging around our house way too much.

10:32.164 --> 10:36.294
So, I volunteered Tim to go with him
to a singles bar for moral support.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.927
I think this is ridiculous.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.440
Well, Tim, there is no sacrifice
too great to make for a friend.

10:41.507 --> 10:46.376
<i>In the words of the very famous wise
men, KC and the Sunshine Band,</i>

10:47.213 --> 10:49.181
"Shake your booty."

10:49.949 --> 10:52.110
Easy to say,
it's not your booty.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.483
Actually, I've gone to far greater
lengths to help out a friend.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.250
I remember when I was in Japan,
my old flame, Miyoshi,

10:58.324 --> 11:00.690
was too ill to attend
a cooking contest.

11:00.793 --> 11:04.354
So I donned her kimono,
applied a light blush,

11:04.463 --> 11:08.024
and submitted her spinach wasabi
rice cakes to the judge.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.669
So, for a friend,
you dressed up as a woman?

11:11.737 --> 11:14.604
Oh, absolutely.
I walked away with first prize.

11:16.275 --> 11:19.608
And a marriage proposal
from the vice president of Toyota.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.080
- So, you see my point?
- What?

11:25.151 --> 11:29.110
Go stuff yourself into those jeans,
then we'll talk about pick-up lines.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.918
I can use the same pick-up line
I used on you.

11:31.991 --> 11:35.722
I don't think she's really gonna like,
"Sorry I hurled on your shoe."

12:01.987 --> 12:04.080
Wow, look at this place!

12:04.890 --> 12:07.518
It's so hip and happenir.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.857
What am I doing here?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.897
Same thing every other guy is doing.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.864
Trying to find a nice,
decent woman in a meat market.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.997
All the women are so beautiful.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.130
What are they gonna want with me?

12:21.540 --> 12:25.237
I don't know. Why don't you ask those
two girls over there looking at you.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.711
- Come with me.
- You don't need me, you're a celebrity.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.122
Hi.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.059
Uh, Tim,
I believe you had something to say?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.125
Hi.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.763
Yeah, that was it. Hi.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.803
- I'm Kathy.
- I'm Donna.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.396
And, you would be...

12:57.309 --> 12:58.640
Good one!

13:00.412 --> 13:01.777
You are from out of town?

13:01.847 --> 13:05.214
No, we've lived in Detroit
all our lives.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.742
<i>Oh, well, have you
seen a show called Tool Time?</i>

13:08.821 --> 13:10.516
- No.
- Uh-uh.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.615
- What is it?
- It's a very popular television show.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.819
- Oh. Cool.
- Really? Wow.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.954
- And I'm the star.
- Wow!

13:18.130 --> 13:20.621
- Oh!
- Wow!

13:20.699 --> 13:22.724
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.264
Anyhoo, where was I?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.673
- Sheboygan
- Sheboygan, yeah.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.708
The autograph hounds would not
give me a moment's peace.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.146
Oh, wow.

13:37.216 --> 13:41.516
It must be wonderful to work with
a star of Al's magnitude.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.589
What do you do on the show?

13:46.125 --> 13:48.252
He assists me.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.693
Actually, I stand around

13:50.796 --> 13:53.560
and he takes shots at
my grossly overweight mother.

13:55.534 --> 13:59.197
- I've always had a thing for sidekicks.
- Hmm.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.239
Something salty?

14:04.043 --> 14:06.807
But I think you're
cute enough to be the star.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.876
We gotta go.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.542
- Al.
- Huh?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.709
You got that beard moussing
at 5:00 a.m.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.949
- What are you talking about?
- We don't want to be late for Jill.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.286
- Jill's my boss.
- Oh.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.919
- Oh, uh... I...
- You know, I gotta get going anyway.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.453
Well, Tim, you know, if you feel like
hanging out a little longer,

14:26.532 --> 14:30.263
then I could always just
drive you to work in the morning.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.563
What kinda car do you got?

14:39.912 --> 14:41.812
Tim.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.845
Morning? Well, then you would...

14:47.419 --> 14:49.979
Well,
it was great meeting you.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.920
Maybe we can get together again?

14:51.991 --> 14:55.483
Hey, who knows? In the future,
down the line, our paths may cross.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.324
How about tomorrow night?

14:57.429 --> 14:58.794
We'd love to!

14:58.898 --> 15:02.595
That's great! Then the four of us
have a date right here at 8:00.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.192
I can't wait.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.431
Don't worry about the drinks,
they're on me.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.800
Thanks. Bye.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.843
What are you thinking about?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.476
You got me into a date!

15:20.552 --> 15:24.511
Well, I, I wanted to see Kathy again and
I didn't want Donna to feel left out.

15:24.590 --> 15:29.152
And you... You were so cold to her, she
probably thinks you're not interested.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.958
I'm not interested,
I'm married, you idiot!

15:36.135 --> 15:38.899
Well, that's no excuse
for bad manners.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.965
Let's talk about bad manners.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.703
<i>Lying for two hours
saying you hosted Tool Time?</i>

15:45.544 --> 15:50.072
Ok, I did, but I can clear
all that up tomorrow night on our date.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.380
Perfect. While you clear that up,
clear up why I'm not gonna be there.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.784
No, no, no, you have to come with me.
Just...

15:55.854 --> 15:58.345
...fly with me one more time,
you're my copilot.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.892
Not spending the night here
with a beautiful woman

16:00.960 --> 16:02.655
who worships the ground I stand on.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.821
I'm gonna spend the night with my wife.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.929
Hey, Dad, you all ready
for your big date tonight?

16:17.609 --> 16:20.737
It's not a date, I'm actually
breaking up with her tonight.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.375
Already?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.179
That was a short romance.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.618
There was never a romance,
there never will be a romance.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.986
Well, not with that attitude.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.959
Fellas, the only reason
I'm going down there tonight,

16:37.029 --> 16:39.395
is I don't trust Al
to tell that woman I'm married.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.465
Maybe it's just me,

16:40.566 --> 16:44.297
but shouldn't you have told her
you're married on the first date?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.464
And you're supposed to be
our role model.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.977
Whoa! Why are you wearing that?

16:53.045 --> 16:56.537
- For the date I'm going on.
- You can't wear that.

16:56.615 --> 17:00.676
If these pants were any tighter, my
navel would be under my Adam's apple.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.222
Well, I know. I want you
to wear looser pants.

17:04.323 --> 17:07.656
- You look way too sexy.
- I thought you wanted me to look sexy.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.819
To pick up a woman,
not break up with one.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.121
So I dress like a slob?

17:14.199 --> 17:18.067
Yeah, just dress the way you normally
do, the rest will take care of itself.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.239
So, Kathy, what is it like

17:24.309 --> 17:27.472
working for a company
that manufactures spools?

17:27.579 --> 17:29.547
It's great.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.584
Really? Where do you
learn about spools?

17:32.684 --> 17:34.777
Spool school?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.653
I'm gonna tell her the truth right now.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.027
And then you go to graduate spool?

17:49.268 --> 17:51.998
Just wait till I make
another date with Kathy.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.136
- Tim, how do you feel about marriage?
- Hate it.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.142
What?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.974
- Wow, how about kids?
- I had a vasectomy.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.213
Really? That is terrific.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.676
Well, it's not as much fun as it sounds.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.118
I have always felt
that marriage was very confining

18:12.191 --> 18:17.060
and that kids greatly take away from
the raw power of the sexual experience.

18:18.964 --> 18:22.127
Have you noticed the mustard stain
on these chinos?

18:23.368 --> 18:26.337
I'm not looking at the mustard,
I'm looking at the buns.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.339
Hello! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.900
I have to go to the little
mechanics room, Al, you wanna join me?

18:32.978 --> 18:34.673
- Huh?
- Go change our oil.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.771
- Huh?
- Flush our coolants.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.316
What?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.947
Pee.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.858
- This charade's gotta stop.
- What?

18:49.928 --> 18:53.796
- We gotta tell those women the truth.
- Wait till after the shrimp cocktail.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.131
I'm tired of lying.
I hate her touching me,

18:57.202 --> 19:00.228
I can't pretend to be
something that I'm not.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.807
Perfect timing. Look,
the shrimp cocktail just arrived.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.149
- Hey, before we eat...
- Hey, Tim, look! Tiger prawns.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.250
Before we eat,
I want to make a confession.

19:19.358 --> 19:22.020
You're not really on TV, are you?

19:22.094 --> 19:25.621
No, no, we are.
But, Tim is actually the star.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.858
Yeah, they call me "The Tool Man."

19:27.966 --> 19:30.298
Ooh, I bet they do.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.238
They call me the married tool man.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.870
Aww, man.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.705
- But, but it's not his fault.
- No.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.278
You see, I, I was recovering
from a break-up

19:41.346 --> 19:43.678
and I was feeling uneasy
about dating again.

19:43.749 --> 19:47.116
- So, I asked Tim to...
- Deceive my best friend?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.949
And you lied to me.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.546
Well, I hope this doesn't
affect our future.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.457
It can't. Because there is no future.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.553
Just checking.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.599
Does your wife know
you're at a singles bar?

20:06.104 --> 20:08.664
It was her idea.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.505
Oh, you showbiz people are sick.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.179
I hate the single life.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.379
Well, this singles thing
is a lot tougher than I thought.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.615
I should never have lied to her.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.850
No, you shouldn't have lied to her.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.193
But, she liked you for a while.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.162
She did, didn't she?

20:33.432 --> 20:34.899
It was a good first step.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.061
If it wasrt for you, I wouldn't have
been here to take that.

20:38.136 --> 20:41.367
Thanks to you, Tim, I...
I've gained my confidence back!

20:41.440 --> 20:43.670
And I learned
something about spools.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.546
You don't need me to find women.
You're, you're...

20:49.514 --> 20:51.482
...check out 3:00.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.580
No, 3:00.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.656
Excuse me.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.063
Excuse me.

21:06.131 --> 21:09.760
Hi, I'm Al Borland
and I would like to buy you a drink.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.803
Oh, I don't drink.

21:11.903 --> 21:15.532
Mostly I just sit here
building forts out of swizzle sticks.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.015
Hello, again. I'm Richard.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.313
You like jazz?

21:37.329 --> 21:40.264
Not to worry, I've got
emergency towelettes in my car.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.967
Emergency toilettes.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.163
He can't get... toilets.

21:54.546 --> 21:58.573
What's the matter with you
you just got...
