WEBVTT

00:15.280 --> 00:17.840
We're almost there!
The supplies Corvus steals

00:17.920 --> 00:20.280
from the villagers
are just over that ridge.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.480
Thanks, Yorly. Appreciate this.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.280
Hey, you Freebot Fighters are my heroes.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.760
-How'd you even find out about this place?
-A friend of a friend.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.680
Of a friend. Get it.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.880
And they said no Centurions even guard it?

00:32.960 --> 00:34.920
Guess Corvus figured no one would find it.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.480
Huh! Right. And if they did,
who'd be fool enough to steal from Corvus?

00:49.120 --> 00:52.560
Whoa! This is too good to be true.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.200
Yeah. Was thinking the same thing.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.920
Hey! Where's...?

00:58.200 --> 00:59.800
Too good to be true.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.960
It's a trap!

01:49.360 --> 01:50.200
On three.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.720
-One, two...
-Now!

01:58.960 --> 02:00.960
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha!

02:01.320 --> 02:03.200
-[Livia] Come on!
-[Ariston] Let's go!

02:20.000 --> 02:20.840
[grunts]

02:24.080 --> 02:26.320
Agh! A little help!

02:28.840 --> 02:30.400
[Ariston] Hey! Up here!

02:33.720 --> 02:34.640
Catch!

02:41.680 --> 02:42.560
Thanks!

02:51.560 --> 02:53.120
Come on! Let's go!

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
[grunts] Surprise!

03:07.880 --> 03:09.200
That was the last one.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.720
The crates... every one empty.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.840
Never were any stolen supplies,
at least not here.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.480
Were we ever set up?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.040
Guess you have to be careful
who you trust.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.400
Ah, Feronia!

03:32.480 --> 03:34.680
Dr Naron, you startled me.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.120
My apologies.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.560
How goes your tinkering?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.560
Afraid not so well.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.240
Personally, I really don't think
there's much hope for Project Evolution.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.720
On the contrary,
there's something I want to show you.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.000
Seen this before.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.840
Actually, I don't think you have.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.120
As you know, previous test subjects
were never fully able

03:58.200 --> 04:02.600
to execute this obstacle course,
even after assessing the situation.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.440
Their data tabulations and stimuli
response times were never sufficient.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.480
So, you see, in spite of your misgivings,

04:44.560 --> 04:47.200
Project Evolution is a success.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.400
Danuvia must be pleased.
And you're ready to mass-produce?

04:51.480 --> 04:55.160
Not quite. A few more tests,
then the Facility will begin

04:55.240 --> 04:59.200
replacing Centurions
with a new, superior Corvus army.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.600
Well, then, Dr Naron, congratulations.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.840
Of course,

05:05.920 --> 05:11.000
I imagine Danuvia will no longer be
needing your services in the prison lab.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.560
[bleeping]

05:31.240 --> 05:32.160
Come with me.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.280
[distant cheering]

05:42.840 --> 05:47.680
Robo-Robozuna! It's hard to believe
that we're already near the start

05:47.760 --> 05:50.320
of Robozuna's big mid-season tournament.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.800
That's right, Spanner. As you all know,
this tournament is comprised

05:53.880 --> 05:56.680
of the top eight Robozuna teams
paired up.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.960
-[Spanner] <i>That's a whole lot of teams!</i>
<i>-It sure is, Spanner!</i>

06:01.040 --> 06:04.480
Not only will the overall winners move up
in the rankings,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.720
they'll take home some big prize money!

06:07.800 --> 06:09.680
Ow! My Foot!

06:12.840 --> 06:16.400
Chike, what a surprise. No trash talk?

06:16.480 --> 06:17.320
Chandra!

06:17.400 --> 06:20.200
Uh, yeah.
Got a different strategy this game.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.960
You mean the game where your team and mine
team up to play Pardus and Blata?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.160
-Yeah. Got it all figured out.
-Me, too.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.400
And since Team Vulpes did win
when you last played us,

06:31.480 --> 06:34.640
instead of your strategy,
I figured we should use mine!

06:39.080 --> 06:42.680
Remember the game plan.
Since we're the only team who can afford

06:42.760 --> 06:46.360
more than three Combatabots,
we damage our opponents early.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.480
If we can't outplay them,
we'll outlast them.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.200
I'll remember the game plan...
because it was my plan!

06:53.680 --> 06:58.280
Hi, I'm Xela, coach of Team Chiro.
We're teaming up, playing together.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.080
[chuckles] Sure.

07:01.920 --> 07:07.480
And after we beat Teams Capra and Ursus,
we destroy Teams Vulpes and Veredus!

07:07.560 --> 07:10.480
That is if you don't get blown away
in your first match.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.840
[chuckles] Losers!

07:15.480 --> 07:18.320
Forget Gizi and Zeve. Take a look.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.080
[announcer]<i> Fellow citizens,</i>
<i>the Corvus Imperium Truth Ministry</i>

07:22.160 --> 07:25.480
<i>has learned that the Freebot Fighters</i>
<i>are in the Burnum area</i>

07:25.560 --> 07:29.120
<i>and are responsible for multiple thefts</i>
<i>and robberies.</i>

07:29.440 --> 07:34.320
Stealing from the weak and the poor,
I'd like to get my hands on those losers!

07:34.400 --> 07:37.840
Why Imperium Truth Ministry
not speak truth?

07:38.360 --> 07:39.480
Long story.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.560
Think I'll go see how Civette's doing.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.240
At least we know we can trust her,
unlike your friend, Yorly, this morning.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.080
Pft! Let's hope.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.960
[announcer] <i>Any citizen with information</i>
<i>leading to the Freebot Fighters' capture</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:56.640
<i>will be generously rewarded</i>
<i>with 40,000 Corvus credits.</i>

07:56.720 --> 08:02.320
<i>-All hail Caesar Malum!</i>
-Woo! 40,000 C-creds.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.600
That'd buy a nice new Combatabot.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.240
Or at least get some nice, new upgrades.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.000
What? You couldn't use the reward?

08:11.640 --> 08:15.880
Yeah. Sure, but the Freebots
aren't really bad. They help people.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.560
I mean, so I've heard.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.720
I heard that, too.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.960
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm not going to get that reward.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.840
I've never even seen the Freebots.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.280
Got word. It's time. Feronia's ready.
Remember the plan?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.320
Rafie's doing the heavy lifting.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.240
We're just the distraction.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.800
Correct. Now, hurry.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.240
We need to get
Feronia out of that prison fast.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.880
What's "trust"? Who do you trust?

09:05.440 --> 09:06.880
Trust. It's...

09:07.840 --> 09:10.800
-A long story?
-No. It's just...

09:11.280 --> 09:13.240
Well, when you trust someone,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.960
you believe in them,
believe them to be good,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.680
someone who will befriend you,
not betray you,

09:18.760 --> 09:20.640
someone who will protect you.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.960
Mangle protect.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.400
I know. You're someone I trust.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.400
Hm.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.800
There. That should surprise
all my former colleagues at the Facility.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.960
-[Vermis] Feronia.
-[gasps]

09:50.040 --> 09:52.400
Up to your usual mischief, no doubt.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.680
I warned Danuvia she couldn't trust you.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.240
Self-destruct.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.200
[chuckles]

09:59.280 --> 10:03.120
Ah, yes. I imagine
you'd like to see me do that.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.240
But I'm not one of your robots.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.240
I wasn't talking to you.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.480
[grunts]

10:16.880 --> 10:21.120
We're about to start the second game
of this mid-season tournament.

10:21.200 --> 10:26.360
But first, let's recap on that exciting
first match between Teams Natrix/Chiro

10:26.440 --> 10:29.880
-and Teams Capra/Ursus.
-Right. The first--

10:29.960 --> 10:33.400
The first round went
to Teams Natrix/Chiro!

10:33.480 --> 10:34.640
[grunting]

10:37.080 --> 10:40.640
-The dread-shred!
-The full metal meltdown!

10:40.720 --> 10:42.200
[grunting]

10:42.600 --> 10:45.480
[Slick]
<i>With Team Natrix's Torch scoring easily.</i>

10:45.560 --> 10:47.080
And then in the second--

10:47.160 --> 10:48.640
In the second round,

10:48.720 --> 10:52.880
Mega-Batabot came through
for Teams Natrix/Chiro,

10:52.960 --> 10:56.120
grabbing a quick goal to win
the round and the game!

10:56.200 --> 11:00.000
Mega-Claw! Mega-Saw!

11:00.080 --> 11:01.240
[cackles]

11:01.320 --> 11:04.120
-[groans]
-[cackles]

11:04.200 --> 11:06.400
Mega-Claw! Mega-Saw!

11:06.480 --> 11:11.760
But for some reason, Team Chiro
decided to stay on the side lines!

11:11.840 --> 11:15.400
Guess some teams don't know
how to share a thudball.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.840
Robo-Robozuna!

11:17.920 --> 11:21.080
And some announcers
don't know how to share a mic!

11:21.720 --> 11:23.120
Ooh! Ow!

11:23.200 --> 11:26.120
Robo-Robozuna!

11:26.200 --> 11:28.280
And now, down on the playing field,

11:28.360 --> 11:31.960
the paired-up teams of Veredus and Vulpes
are ready to face off

11:32.040 --> 11:34.440
against Team Pardus and Team Blata.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.360
Where's the rest of your team?

11:37.440 --> 11:39.600
Where's Mangle? Where's Ariston?

11:40.160 --> 11:42.720
Ariston, uh... Mangle, uh...

11:42.800 --> 11:45.680
Uh, Ariston had to make some repairs
to Mangle.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.920
But I wanted Mangle in round one.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.840
-Trust me, Clunk's got this.
-[buzzer]

11:53.440 --> 11:57.720
[Spanner] <i>And this two-on-two round is off</i>
<i>to an explosive start!</i>

11:57.800 --> 12:00.360
<i>Team Blata's Pulp snags the thudball!</i>

12:01.600 --> 12:04.080
The ratchet-comin'-atcha!

12:04.560 --> 12:07.280
Pulp gonna pulp-erise ya!

12:11.560 --> 12:12.400
Got it!

12:12.840 --> 12:15.840
See? Like I said, Clunk's got this.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.560
Worked the logistics out
on my trusty tech pad.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.000
[groans]

12:25.080 --> 12:29.040
<i>Whoa! Watch out!</i>
<i>Pulp and Snips are double-teaming Clunk!</i>

12:29.120 --> 12:30.320
[Pulp] The power-cut!

12:31.040 --> 12:32.920
Clunk-a matic!

12:33.000 --> 12:36.320
[Spanner] <i>Woo-hoo!</i>
<i>And now Pulp has the ball!</i>

12:41.560 --> 12:46.040
<i>And there you have it.</i>
<i>Teams Pardus/Blata win round one!</i>

12:47.760 --> 12:51.560
Next time, better let me use
my trusty tech pad.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.520
Almost to the truck.
You'll be free of this place soon enough.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.360
Wait. Need to inspect.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.000
Inspect? Come on. You know me. Rafie?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.040
This is just my usual scrap pickup,
for recycling.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.160
-You never--
-Need to inspect.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.560
[explosion]

13:17.240 --> 13:18.920
[Rafie] The Freebot Fighters over there!

13:22.680 --> 13:24.560
Hey! What about the inspection?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.280
Not now! Go!

13:27.600 --> 13:28.480
Ah, well!

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
[pants]

13:33.760 --> 13:35.960
Here come our rides. Follow my lead.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.960
[engines rev and tyres screech]

13:40.560 --> 13:42.560
We surrender! We surrender!

13:43.640 --> 13:45.000
Turn around.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.320
I will repeat my command.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.760
No need. Heard you the first time.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.760
You said: "Turn around."

13:55.120 --> 13:56.520
That's what I did.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.760
Oh, yeah, almost forgot... to do this!

14:04.960 --> 14:06.960
[engine revs and tyres screech]

14:09.320 --> 14:12.640
They're not clear.
Need to distract a little longer.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.920
[tyres screech]

14:19.560 --> 14:22.040
Not the kind of distraction
I was thinking of.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.960
-Trust me?
-Yep.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.400
Now, trust me,
head for that assault bike.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.640
[tyres screech and engine revs]

14:33.480 --> 14:37.640
It won't be easy,
but together... we can do this!

14:44.880 --> 14:48.360
They made it out. Now it's our turn.
Let's get out of here.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.080
Team Veredus/Vulpes may have lost
round one,

14:57.160 --> 14:59.720
but they're looking strong here
in the second round,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.600
with some more two-on-two action.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.480
Their strategy with the thudball seems
to be all about sharing,

15:05.560 --> 15:08.360
something maybe
we could do a little more of.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.680
[nervously] Uh, thanks, Spanner.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.800
<i>But down on the field, it looks like</i>

15:12.880 --> 15:17.000
<i>Team Pardus/Blata want Spark</i>
<i>to share the thudball with them.</i>

15:17.080 --> 15:21.040
-The flouting clout!
-Taser-jab!

15:22.680 --> 15:24.120
Gripper rip ya!

15:25.160 --> 15:28.320
[grunting and gibbering]

15:31.080 --> 15:34.240
[autotune voice]
The windmill spin and win!

15:36.680 --> 15:39.480
You sure pairing Spark and Brawler
is the right team-up?

15:39.560 --> 15:41.880
Trust me, I've studied your playbook.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.080
You've studied me?

15:43.160 --> 15:45.600
Made a few changes. Several, actually.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.160
Spark, pass!

15:49.640 --> 15:51.560
Pass? Should've had him run!

16:00.680 --> 16:02.360
[groans] See?

16:03.040 --> 16:07.240
Ah! What's the matter, Brawler?
Nowhere to run?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.760
Brawler, you know what to do!

16:11.440 --> 16:14.000
Not run, pass!

16:14.560 --> 16:20.360
[Slick] <i>Robo-Robozuna! What a throw!</i>
<i>What a catch! What a play!</i>

16:23.240 --> 16:25.160
<i>What a goal!</i>

16:25.240 --> 16:30.000
-And that ends round two with...
-The game all tied up!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.200
We scored! We did it!

16:32.280 --> 16:34.760
I mean, uh... well, uh, you...

16:35.200 --> 16:38.800
No, Chike, We did it!
We're a team, remember?

16:38.880 --> 16:40.560
[bleeping]

16:40.640 --> 16:42.320
[Centurion] <i>Prisoner 118 missing.</i>

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
Oh!

16:45.960 --> 16:47.920
I'm guessing the mission was a success.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.640
It was. Hurried back as fast as we could.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.880
Ariston... good. We need Mangle in now.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.360
With Pincer for round three,
it's another two-on-two round.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.040
Now? But there's a little damage and...

17:01.800 --> 17:04.840
-Damage? Thought he was repairing that.
-I was?

17:05.160 --> 17:08.600
I mean... I was! But I couldn't.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.160
Arm little loose.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.120
Oh! What happened?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.960
Long story.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.400
[Slick] <i>And remember,</i>
<i>the winners of this game,</i>

17:24.480 --> 17:28.480
<i>this round, go on to face</i>
<i>Teams Natrix/Chiro</i>

17:28.560 --> 17:33.400
<i>in tomorrow's Robozuna</i>
<i>mid-season play-off tournament!</i>

17:33.480 --> 17:36.280
<i>But now it's the start of round three</i>

17:36.360 --> 17:39.280
<i>and Dent has the thudball</i>
<i>for Teams Pardus/Blata!</i>

17:39.360 --> 17:41.720
That's Dent-er-tainment!

17:43.200 --> 17:46.800
Dent's gonna get pinched! [grunts]

17:50.640 --> 17:52.640
[cheering]

17:57.400 --> 18:00.120
Mangle! Block Gasket!

18:00.440 --> 18:03.240
[Gasket grunts] Mangle! Uh!

18:03.320 --> 18:05.680
[Spanner] <i>Oh, tough break for Mangle.</i>

18:05.760 --> 18:07.320
[both groan]

18:07.400 --> 18:10.960
[Slick] <i>Yes, but his Vulpes teammate,</i>
<i>Pincer, has the thudball!</i>

18:11.320 --> 18:14.760
[mutters and grunts]

18:14.840 --> 18:16.920
[grunting and groaning]

18:19.440 --> 18:20.640
[cheering]

18:20.720 --> 18:22.400
[Slick] <i>No! Now Dent has it!</i>

18:25.320 --> 18:27.960
<i>And he shoots! Looks like this game is--</i>

18:28.040 --> 18:29.400
[Spanner] Not over!

18:30.240 --> 18:32.280
[mutters and grunts]

18:40.760 --> 18:44.880
[crowd chant] Mangle! Mangle!
Mangle! Mangle! Mangle...

18:46.880 --> 18:50.320
[Slick] <i>Unbelievable! Mangle scores!</i>

18:50.400 --> 18:52.520
Teams Veredus/Vulpes win!

18:52.600 --> 18:56.400
[both] Robo-Robozuna!

18:57.280 --> 18:59.280
[electronic gibbering]

19:09.320 --> 19:13.120
Guess we should we start planning
for tomorrow's game against Team Natrix.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.480
Don't forget,
winners get all that prize money

19:16.560 --> 19:19.200
and I, for one, could sure use it.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.320
Sorry, can't.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.840
Got to go.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.440
See you tomorrow?

19:46.640 --> 19:49.800
So, from what you've told us,

19:49.880 --> 19:52.440
it sounds like
you should go to prison more often.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.640
Not if I have a choice.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.120
The food is almost as bad as your cooking.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.160
Learned all my recipes from you.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.760
At least you were able to plant
that computer virus.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.680
And with luck it will destroy
all the Facility's research data

20:05.760 --> 20:07.240
on Project Evolution.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.760
But trust me, we still have work to do.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.000
It won't be easy.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.280
But together, we can do this.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.240
Chike? Chike?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.240
Hello?

20:27.080 --> 20:28.680
You left your tech pad!

20:29.840 --> 20:31.960
Hello? Anyone here?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.720
[gasps]

20:51.120 --> 20:52.400
Whoa!

21:11.080 --> 21:15.040
[announcer] <i>Still at large,</i>
<i>these treacherous outlaws pose</i>

21:15.120 --> 21:18.320
<i>a dangerous threat to the peace</i>
<i>and harmony of our great community.</i>

21:18.400 --> 21:21.920
<i>With that in mind,</i>
<i>the Corvus Imperium Truth Ministry</i>

21:22.000 --> 21:25.880
<i>continues to offer its reward</i>
<i>of 40,000 Corvus credits</i>

21:25.960 --> 21:31.400
<i>for any information leading to the capture</i>
<i>and incarceration of the Freebot Fighters.</i>

21:31.880 --> 21:34.080
-Chandra!
-Yorly!

21:34.160 --> 21:36.080
So, do we have a deal?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.040
Yeah, maybe.
