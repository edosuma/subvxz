Captain's log, stardate 42609.1 .

00:07.215 --> 00:10.259
ln response to a desperate plea
from my old friend,

00:10.468 --> 00:13.012
Captain Donald Varley
ofthe U.S.S. Yamato,

00:13.221 --> 00:15.973
l'm running a grave risk
by taking the Enterprise

00:16.182 --> 00:17.975
into the Neutral Zone.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.853
Varley's request was prompted
by dangerous malfunctions

00:21.062 --> 00:22.688
which have been plaguing
our sister ship.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.940
Perhaps with both crews
working together,

00:25.150 --> 00:26.734
we can eliminate the problems

00:26.943 --> 00:30.446
before our presence is detected
by the Romulans.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.326
How long to rendezvous,
Mr. Crusher?

00:36.536 --> 00:39.329
Four minutes and 33 seconds, sir.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.290
Status of download, Mr. Data?

00:41.499 --> 00:44.043
The Yamato log should be
in our computer by rendezvous, sir.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.545
Have you nailed down
our little hiccup yet?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.297
- Sir?
- The odd reading?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.382
No, sir. lt might be due to problems

00:50.592 --> 00:53.427
currently being experienced
by the Yamato.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.472
Trouble, Number One?

00:56.973 --> 00:59.391
l'm not sure, sir.
Are we alone out here, Worf?

00:59.601 --> 01:03.187
Yes, sir. There are no other vessels
in the area except the Yamato,

01:03.396 --> 01:06.440
which is coming
into visual range now.

doing in a place like this?

01:20.955 --> 01:22.873
It's good to see you again,
Jean-Luc,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.334
despite your antique humor.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.295
I only hope your people
are able to help us.

Malfunctions are becoming serious.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.718
We lost an Engineering team.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.847
The computer shut down a force field
in an open shuttle bay.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.767
Eighteen people.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.646
Do you have any idea
what caused this, sir?

01:45.855 --> 01:48.774
None. They're affecting every system
simultaneously.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.860
It's like the ship suddenly decided
to fall apart.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.114
lt's beginning to make me think that
we should've run Galaxy-class ships

01:55.323 --> 01:58.158
across a few more drawing boards
before we built one.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.452
You believe it's a design flaw?

02:00.662 --> 02:03.956
l don't know.
l'm grasping at straws here.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.707
All l know is we've got to get it fixed

02:05.917 --> 02:08.544
and before l lose more
than an Engineering team.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.962
Do you wish to evacuate

02:10.171 --> 02:12.631
any non-essential personnel
to the Enterprise, sir?

02:12.841 --> 02:16.009
No. No, that would be premature.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.304
Donald, we'll get our teams
to work on it immediately.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.473
l'm sure neither of us
feels too comfortable

02:21.683 --> 02:23.308
sitting around in the Neutral Zone.

02:23.726 --> 02:27.229
I know what you're thinking.
What the hell am l doing here?

02:27.438 --> 02:33.318
Well, l heard rumors
about a couple of archaeological digs

02:33.528 --> 02:37.072
that started making the lconians
sound a lot less like legend.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.118
l did a little investigating
and l located their home-world.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.870
ln the Neutral Zone?

02:43.079 --> 02:44.788
ln the Neutral Zone.

02:45.290 --> 02:50.169
Donald, that was quite a risk to run
to satisfy archaeological curiosity.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.756
The risk would be in allowing
the Romulans to locate lconia.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.429
Fortunately, l got there first.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.056
It's a virtually dead planet.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.517
Enough technology remains

03:05.727 --> 03:09.479
to give the Romulans an edge,
if they should find it.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.275
Donald,
your transmission is breaking up.

Are you responsible

No. But believe me, captain,

had we chosen to exercise our right
to defend the Neutral Zone,

07:07.385 --> 07:09.553
Our presence in the Neutral Zone

that deficiency.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.739

08:10.948 --> 08:12.782
but a highly improbable
set of circumstances

08:12.992 --> 08:15.535
has to take place
for such a result to occur.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.621
Explain.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.374
Okay. ln the event
of a breach of seal integrity,

08:21.584 --> 08:25.420
there's an emergency release system
which dumps the antimatter.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.548
Apparently such a dump began,
was then halted,

08:28.758 --> 08:30.550
and the containment seals
were dropped.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.596
There was still sufficient antimatter
present to lead to an explosion.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.557
And so there is no evidence
that a weapon was used?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.643
No, sir. None.

However it happened,
the Yamato did it to herself.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.027
What could have caused
such a catastrophic malfunction?

08:49.445 --> 08:51.988
Well, l think Captain Varley
may have been right.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.282
There may be a design flaw.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.327

LA FORGE: Yes, sir.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.288
lt's the most sophisticated

09:00.498 --> 09:02.207
Something
could have been overlooked.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.337
can you isolate the problem
and solve it?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.673
We're already working on it, sir.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.800
Pull any personnel you can use.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.014
lf we have established
that the Romulans

09:18.224 --> 09:20.725
were not responsible
for the destruction of the Yamato,

09:21.394 --> 09:23.645
would it not be prudent to withdraw?

09:25.481 --> 09:28.316
lf it is a design flaw,
we're better to stay where we are

09:28.526 --> 09:30.986
and give Geordi time to work on it.

Yes. But only inasmuch
as it was the probe

But we weren't scanned

27:36.321 --> 27:39.406
until we solve
our more immediate problem.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.700
You're stalling for time.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.535
Sir, another probe launch
from the planet,

27:43.745 --> 27:45.162
heading toward the Romulans.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.915
- Have we got our phasers back?
- No, sir.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.877
Taris, if you have phaser capability,
prepare to use them now.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.880
- What?
- Destroy that probe!

28:07.394 --> 28:09.436
And not even a thank you.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.022
Subcommander Taris
is deeply frustrated,

28:12.232 --> 28:14.900
probably because her ship
is as crippled as the Enterprise.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.528
Why would the Romulans
be experiencing problems?

28:17.737 --> 28:18.987
They weren't probed.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.115
They must have tapped
into the Yamato log.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.908
[SYSTEMS POWER DOWN]

28:24.494 --> 28:27.162
Taris got a whole lot more
than she bargained for.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.832
Maintain red alert.

28:30.041 --> 28:34.753
Try to keep those shields up in case
Taris decides to act on her threat.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.505
WESLEY:
Commander?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.298
What about the away team?

28:38.508 --> 28:40.843
With the shields up,
we can't beam them back.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.936
PlCARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.814
While there is little left
on the surface of lconia,

28:54.023 --> 28:56.525
we have found what appears to be
a control center

28:56.735 --> 28:59.528
which seems
to have remained intact.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.533
WORF:
Come in, Enterprise.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.703
Still no response, sir.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.954
Keep trying them.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.665
Communications are bound
to be erratic.

29:13.209 --> 29:17.546
l would not like to become
a permanent resident of this planet.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.299
Nor would l, Mr. Worf.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.599
Scanners show no other life forms
on the planet, sir.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.059
PlCARD:
l would not expect any.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.563
Judging from the severity
of the bombardment,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.357
l doubt any lconians survived.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.318
Well...

29:40.278 --> 29:43.322
Mr. Data, let's see
what sense we can make of this.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.157
Aye, sir.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.160
This is very reminiscent of Dinasian.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.411
Yes, sir.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.540
There are also similarities
to Dewan and lccobar.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.335
ls it possible they could be branches
of the same language family,

29:56.544 --> 29:59.379
- beginning with lconian?
- lt is, sir.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.050
Run a comparison
using basic simple words

30:03.259 --> 30:05.594
from Dinasian, Dewan, and lccobar.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.014
See if we can reconstruct
a common root language.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.141
Accessing, sir.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.321
You're jumpy.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.784
The tension on the ship is very high.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.039
What's your recommendation?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.584
Give everyone something to do.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.795
Somewhere to focus their attention.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.589
All right.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.177
Let's consider evacuation.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.054
To the planet?

30:49.264 --> 30:53.183
l know it's probably impossible
with Taris sitting out there.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.603
But it would give everyone
something to do.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.438
You go and organize it.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.817
But you might need me if you have
to negotiate with Taris again.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.027
l'll manage.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.488
Right now they're more important.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.335
DATA:
Captain.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.506
Your original hypothesis is correct.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.050
lconian is the parent tongue
of a language family

31:27.260 --> 31:30.470
which consists of lccobar,
Dewan, and Dinasian.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.681
l've constructed
a basic working understanding

31:32.891 --> 31:34.850
through a comparison
of common root words

31:35.059 --> 31:37.019
such as mother, father, child,

31:37.228 --> 31:40.147
home, tribe, food, life,
death, yours, ours, mine.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.065
Data, Data, Data.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.067
You do understand, sir,
that my interpretation

31:44.277 --> 31:46.069
of the symbols will not be exact.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.822
Yes. Let's get on with it.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.658
This would appear to be
manual override.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.757
That was not manual override.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.677
Demons of air and darkness,
indeed.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.392
- What is that?
- A gateway.

32:17.602 --> 32:21.188
These scenes
could be holographic images.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.439
PlCARD:
Be careful.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.277
Data!

32:27.612 --> 32:28.987
That was very foolish.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.448
But we have established
that this is not a holograph.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.158
lf l step through and investigate,

32:33.368 --> 32:36.370
we could determine
whether this is truly a gateway.

32:36.579 --> 32:40.999
No, Data. You might not be able
to get back, and l can't risk losing you.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.501
lf it is not illusion,

32:42.710 --> 32:45.921
this gate would seem to take us
beyond the confines of this planet.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.590
ls this how the lconians traveled?

32:49.175 --> 32:52.719
Crossing light years
as easily as we would cross a room?

32:53.054 --> 32:56.515
Those places could be on worlds
in distant corners of the galaxy.

32:56.724 --> 33:00.936
l think the lconians
might have outfoxed their enemies.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.481
Maybe they didn't all die
in the bombardment.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.818
Some of them could have passed
through this.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.570
This is what Varley feared.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.615
- This is what he died for.
- Sir?

33:14.117 --> 33:17.619
The Romulans could use
this technology as a weapon.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.581
- Like the lconians did.
- No, l disagree.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.667
Captain,
there is nothing in this room

33:23.876 --> 33:26.837
to indicate it was used
as a military command center.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.631
Perhaps a transporter room.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.384
But the probe was hostile.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.302
PlCARD:
We can't make that assumption.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.096
The effect on the Yamato
was devastating.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.433
But what if it was by accident,
not by design?

33:39.726 --> 33:42.811
What l'm going to say
may sound unscientific,

33:43.021 --> 33:46.815
but standing on this soil,
breathing in this air,

33:47.025 --> 33:49.693
my instincts tell me
that we may have got them wrong.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.404
But we do know
the lconians were conquerors.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.322
PlCARD: But that knowledge
was passed down

33:54.532 --> 33:56.575
by the descendants of those
who attacked this world.

33:56.784 --> 34:00.662
The victors invariably write the history
to their own advantage.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.790
There is an unfortunate tendency
in many cultures

34:04.000 --> 34:06.960
to fear what they do not understand.

34:07.170 --> 34:11.214
lt's possible that their enemies,
confronted by this technology,

34:11.424 --> 34:14.342
were driven to attack the lconians
out of fear.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.263
Sir!

34:24.854 --> 34:26.605
Was that really the Enterprise?

34:27.398 --> 34:29.483
l believe that it was.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.819
Gentlemen, we have a way home.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.615
Captain, there is a vast
underground power source

34:36.824 --> 34:39.409
which is controlled by this console.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.745
l believe my triggering
of the gateway

34:41.954 --> 34:44.623
has caused a dramatic upsurge
in the power level.

34:46.292 --> 34:49.586
Ah. l have access.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.440

35:11.192 --> 35:13.193

Captain, the Enterprise again.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.269
How long is the interval?

35:47.478 --> 35:50.689
About four minutes,
if the cycle holds.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.649
The next time
the Enterprise appears,

35:52.859 --> 35:54.067
go through it with Data.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.778
Geordi will be able to learn from him.
Maybe help him.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.991
Sir, we have not yet established that
that is truly a gateway.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.659
This will be the test.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.786
Aye, sir.

36:07.623 --> 36:08.748
Destroy the tricorder.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.503
Sir, it contains everything
we discovered up to this point.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.798
And that is precisely
why it must be destroyed.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.801
How long?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.053
About three minutes.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.016
l'm running out of time.

We all are.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.648
Data, l have to destroy this.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.609
This control room and its technology

36:35.818 --> 36:37.652
must not be allowed to fall
into Romulan hands.

l understand, sir.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.323
How?

36:41.532 --> 36:43.658
How do l do it?
How do l destroy everything?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.411
The control room, the probes,
all of it.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.459
The power source, sir.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.170
l detonate it.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.214
But how? How do l do that?

36:57.423 --> 37:00.050
The probes, sir.

37:00.259 --> 37:03.386
Probes? The probes.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.264
Launch.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.600
l launch the probes?

37:08.809 --> 37:11.019
But why?

37:11.687 --> 37:13.104
What good will that do?

37:13.314 --> 37:16.858
- The doors, sir.
- Doors?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.361
Perhaps the probes
are in a launch bay.

37:20.780 --> 37:24.032
lf the doors are closed,
then the backwash from the rockets

37:24.200 --> 37:26.576
will spill into the power bridge
and there'll be an overload.

37:26.744 --> 37:27.786
Yes, sir.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.747
But the doors will open automatically
when the launch begins.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.709
- And l will override.
- Correct, sir.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.922
Which control keys? Damn.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.799
Of course, you can't see.

Help.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.971
Worf, help him up.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.186
Describe, please.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.397
l'm standing directly
in front of the gate.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.275
To my left
there is a small, triangular screen.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.529
Right. One meter.

38:02.738 --> 38:04.322
Right.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.993
Now, to my right

38:20.131 --> 38:21.881
How do l override the doors?

38:22.091 --> 38:24.175
Blue, blue, blue.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.053
l hope that's not a stutter.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.847
l don't know
how long a delay there'll be

38:29.056 --> 38:30.557
between the launch
and the detonation.

38:30.766 --> 38:34.227
l will hold keying the launch sequence
until you're through the gate.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.980
How long
until the Enterprise reappears?

38:39.066 --> 38:40.358
Almost time.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.193
Captain...

38:42.862 --> 38:44.946
You will be killed.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.407
l'll go through the gate.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.367
But where will you end up?

38:49.577 --> 38:53.288
Very shortly, anywhere
will be preferable to this room.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.999
Mr. Worf, l am depending on you.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.001
You must get Data back
to the Enterprise.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.211
He may be their only hope.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.422
Aye, sir.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.773

39:20.733 --> 39:22.817
Worf, what happened?
Where's the captain?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.736
We must take Data to Engineering.

39:24.945 --> 39:27.572
Hopefully, the captain will follow.

39:42.963 --> 39:44.714
l don't know how to help him.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.425
But comparing recorded norms
for Data to these current readings,

39:47.635 --> 39:51.388
it's clear that all his functions
are just going crazy.

He cleared the lconian program
from his system. How?

41:08.257 --> 41:11.676

41:11.886 --> 41:13.261
Now l am on the Enterprise.

- Geordi, this is critical. How?
- Okay, give me a second to think.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.392
There was an incompatible program
running through Data's system,

41:19.602 --> 41:23.646
so the mechanism started searching
for a way to keep him alive.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.940
The solution...

41:26.400 --> 41:27.942
The solution was a shutdown

41:28.152 --> 41:30.403
and a total wipe
of all affected memory.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.572

41:32.781 --> 41:34.324
Can you do the same
with the Enterprise?

41:34.533 --> 41:37.160
l don't see why not, but it will have
to be a complete shutdown.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.704
We turn her off
and effect a wipe of the Yamato log

41:39.914 --> 41:42.707

41:45.127 --> 41:47.045
from the protected archives
in the main core.

41:47.254 --> 41:51.716
Geordi, if we shut down, that means
we're bringing down the shields.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.928
And we're hanging nose-to-nose
with a Romulan battle cruiser.

41:55.262 --> 41:56.971
Hey, commander,
whether it's Romulan phasers

41:57.181 --> 42:00.058
or our own warp engines,
we're just as dead.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.727
Make it so.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.565
May l help?

42:25.417 --> 42:27.585
All systems functioning.

42:27.795 --> 42:31.005
- Lock on the captain, bring him back.
- Scanning, sir.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.174
Got him.

[COMPUTER SPEAKlNG

42:52.736 --> 42:55.530
- l've lost him.
- Damn it.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.407
Got him, sir.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.410
- He's on the Romulan ship.
- How the he--?

43:05.541 --> 43:07.292
Go to your stations.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.427
You did this.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.929
You sabotaged my ship.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.264
Oh, no.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.851
l cannot deactivate
the auto-destruct.

43:25.060 --> 43:30.148
But at least l have the satisfaction
that you will die with us.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.611
Not, l think, today, commander.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.499
- Bridge, Picard.
DATA: Yes, captain?

43:48.709 --> 43:51.210
Take us out of here. The Romulan
vessel is set to auto-destruct,

43:51.420 --> 43:52.462
they can't deactivate it.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.672
- Wait, sir. Open hailing frequencies.
- Open, sir.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.841
Commander Taris,
prepare to receive a transmission

43:57.051 --> 43:59.969
from our chief engineer. He'll instruct
you how to purge your system.

44:00.179 --> 44:03.139
TARlS:
Agreed, Enterprise. Standing by.

44:03.349 --> 44:07.185
Commander, your transmission
has been received and acknowledged.

44:07.394 --> 44:09.479
Now, Mr. Data, warp speed, please.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.982
Just in case Taris' engineer is not
as efficient as our Mr. La Forge.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.776
DATA:
Aye, sir.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.235
Well, Number One,

44:16.445 --> 44:19.739
l can see why you wanna keep
the away missions to yourself.

44:19.948 --> 44:21.407
That's where the excitement is.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.701
So, what's been happening here?

44:23.911 --> 44:26.788
Same old routine, l suppose?
