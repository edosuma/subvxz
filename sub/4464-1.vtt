01:32.760 --> 01:35.228
Men are haunted by the vastness
of eternity.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.592
And so we ask ourselves...

01:38.640 --> 01:41.757
... will our actions echo
across the centuries?

01:42.720 --> 01:46.633
Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone...

01:47.120 --> 01:49.031
...and wonder who we were...

01:49.520 --> 01:51.431
...how bravely we fought...

01:52.480 --> 01:54.391
...how fiercely we loved?

03:40.760 --> 03:42.113
Good day for the crows.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.389
Remove your army from my land.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.312
I like your land.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.872
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.513
They won't fight for you.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.631
That's what the Messenians said.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.678
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.713
Now they all fight for me.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.309
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.710
It's too big, even for you.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.428
I don't want to watch another massacre.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.673
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.671
And if my man wins?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.750
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.031
Boagrius!

04:41.280 --> 04:43.510
Achilles!

04:51.840 --> 04:54.229
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.397
Careful who you insult, old king.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.632
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.473
-Where is he?
-I sent a boy to look for him.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.236
I was having a good dream.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.673
Very good dream.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.836
King Agamemnon sent me.
He needs to--

05:42.000 --> 05:44.070
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.151
But my lord, it is morning.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.430
They're waiting for you.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.990
Are the stories about you true?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.433
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.593
They say you can't be killed.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.513
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.910
The Thessalonian you're fighting. . .

06:14.080 --> 06:18.232
. . .he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.954
That's why no one will remember
your name.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.036
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow, when you're better rested.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.634
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

06:54.920 --> 06:56.399
Perhaps you should fight him.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.312
Achilles.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.792
Achilles.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.115
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.877
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.236
Let them go home to their wives.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.271
Imagine a king who fights his
own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.

07:25.400 --> 07:30.076
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.551
Is there no one else?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.512
Is there no one else?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.878
Who are you, soldier?

08:36.840 --> 08:39.673
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.833
Achilles?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.312
I'll remember the name.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.671
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.674
Give it to your king.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.679
He's not my king.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.434
Brothers in arms!

09:15.600 --> 09:17.716
-Friendship!
-Friendship!

09:25.120 --> 09:28.237
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together. . .

09:29.000 --> 09:30.797
. . .Queen Helen and I salute you.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.670
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.912
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!

09:41.040 --> 09:43.349
But I have always respected your father.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.954
Priam is a good king, a good man.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.999
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.753
Hector, Paris,
young princes, come. Stand.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.514
Drink with me.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.314
Let us drink to peace.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.556
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.834
May the gods keep the wolves
in the hills and the women in our beds.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.470
-For the gods.
-For the gods.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.918
You shouldn't be here.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.389
That's what you said last night.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.910
Last night was a mistake.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.991
And the night before?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.429
I've made many mistakes this week.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.190
Do you want me to go?

12:31.440 --> 12:33.271
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.998
They're beautiful.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.512
But I can't wear them.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.715
Menelaus would kill us both.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.472
Don't be afraid of him.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.590
I'm not afraid of dying.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.396
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.513
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.433
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.237
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea. . .

13:22.320 --> 13:24.356
. . .but I was just a ghost.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.438
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.512
Come with me.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.068
Don't play with me. Don't play.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.232
If you come, we'll never be safe.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.911
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.274
But I'll love you.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.391
Till the day they burn my body. . .

13:51.280 --> 13:53.111
. . .I will love you.

14:14.240 --> 14:18.279
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

14:18.880 --> 14:22.714
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.394
Drop sail!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.479
Do you love me, brother?

14:29.920 --> 14:31.990
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.956
The last time you spoke to me like this. . .

14:37.120 --> 14:40.317
. . .you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.550
What have you done now?

14:44.520 --> 14:45.839
I must show you something.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.674
Where is she?

15:16.120 --> 15:20.113
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

15:20.280 --> 15:21.998
My king!

15:23.880 --> 15:25.199
She left.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.634
With the Trojans.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.393
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.999
The Trojans?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.836
With the young prince, Paris. She. . . .

15:39.560 --> 15:41.630
Get my ship ready.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.110
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.554
High on the sail!

15:46.720 --> 15:48.153
-Wait, wait.
-You fool!

15:48.320 --> 15:50.550
-Listen to me.
-Do you know what you've done?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.996
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.311
I love her.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.272
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

15:59.440 --> 16:03.069
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple maids.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.276
You think you know
something about love.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.839
What about your father's love?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.514
You spat on him when you
brought her on this ship!

16:09.760 --> 16:13.548
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

16:17.040 --> 16:19.190
I won't let you start a war for her.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.793
May I speak?

16:21.920 --> 16:25.833
What you're saying is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.958
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.358
But I go with her.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.672
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.070
Then I'll die fighting.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.676
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.718
-Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
-No.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.871
-Ever seen a man die in combat?
-No.

16:45.040 --> 16:49.113
I've killed men, and I've heard them
dying. And I've watched them dying.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.953
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.271
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.510
And you know nothing about love!

16:57.680 --> 17:00.478
All the same, I go with her.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.756
I won't ask you to fight my war.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.558
You already have.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.919
To Troy!

17:11.079 --> 17:13.992
About ship! Set sail!

17:47.360 --> 17:50.636
-I want her back.
-Well, of course you do.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.393
She's a beautiful woman.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.996
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.358
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.556
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.517
I should have listened to you.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.830
Peace is for the women. . .

18:06.320 --> 18:08.151
. . .and the weak.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.999
Empires are forged by war.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.075
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.036
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.676
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

18:23.840 --> 18:26.513
Never. You're a man of honor.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.311
Will you go to war with me, brother?

18:40.680 --> 18:44.195
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman. . .

18:44.360 --> 18:47.079
. . .but she's proved to be very useful.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.790
The Trojans have never been conquered.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.436
Some say they can't be conquered.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.752
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.793
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.514
But the gods protect only. . .

19:03.360 --> 19:05.112
. . .the strong!

19:05.840 --> 19:07.990
If Troy falls. . .

19:08.160 --> 19:11.197
. . .I control the Aegean.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.954
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.430
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.672
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.678
Send emissaries in the morning.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.478
One last thing.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.837
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.313
Achilles.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.958
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.396
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.389
That man was born to end lives.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.792
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.758
Before me, Greece was nothing.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.195
I brought all the
Greek kingdoms together.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.109
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

19:56.280 --> 19:58.919
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

20:00.960 --> 20:02.996
Achilles is the past.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.312
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.870
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

20:11.040 --> 20:14.157
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.629
We need the greatest warrior.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.115
There's only one man he'll listen to.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.873
Never hesitate.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.872
Nervous?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.116
Petrified.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.113
You told me never
to change sword hands.

21:01.640 --> 21:05.918
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.515
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.037
Patroclus, my cousin.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.437
Odysseus, king of lthaca.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.277
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.793
I miss them.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.118
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

21:47.280 --> 21:49.669
Learning from Achilles himself.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.351
Kings would kill for the honor.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.034
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.274
We need to talk.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.632
I will not fight for him.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.760
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.431
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.830
Are the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.151
-For now.
-The Trojans never harmed me.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.032
They insulted Greece.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.909
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

22:21.080 --> 22:23.435
Your business is war, my friend.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.556
Is it? The man has no honor.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.951
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.078
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.874
-For the Greeks!
-Forget Agamemnon.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.753
Fight for me.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.317
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.913
I'll feel much better.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.878
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.553
A thousand ships.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.440
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?

22:51.600 --> 22:53.909
The best of all the Trojans.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.637
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.711
Even if your cousin doesn't come. . .

22:59.920 --> 23:03.356
. . .I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.675
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.798
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.991
We play with the toys the gods give us.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.472
We sail for Troy in three days.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.711
This war will never be forgotten.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.828
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.670
I knew they would come for you.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.675
Long before you were born. . .

23:59.520 --> 24:01.238
. . .I knew they would come.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.956
They want you to fight in Troy.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.953
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.835
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.399
Do you remember?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.439
Mother. . .

24:24.280 --> 24:26.032
. . .tonight, I decide.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.156
If you stay in Lárisa. . .

24:29.400 --> 24:30.958
. . .you will find peace.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.951
You will find a wonderful woman.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.271
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.557
And they will love you.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.280
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.588
But when your children are dead
and their children after them. . .

24:49.680 --> 24:51.671
. . .your name will be lost.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.634
If you go to Troy. . .

24:57.760 --> 24:59.830
. . .glory will be yours.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.757
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.438
The world will remember your name.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.276
But if you go to Troy. . .

25:14.560 --> 25:16.835
. . .you will never come home.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.749
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.235
And I shall never see you again.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.955
-My son.
-Father.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.915
Paris.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.594
Father.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.110
-This is Helen.
-Helen?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.673
Helen of Sparta?

28:02.360 --> 28:04.237
Helen of Troy.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.796
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.473
For once. . .

28:13.040 --> 28:14.951
. . .the gossips were right.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.388
Welcome.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.269
Come, you must be tired.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.038
Look.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.478
He's grown.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.313
He is strong.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.516
-Briseis!
-Paris!

28:46.080 --> 28:49.516
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.151
Briseis.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.312
A servant of Apollo now.

28:55.480 --> 28:59.234
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.354
Father. . .

29:21.520 --> 29:23.988
. . .I know this is the last thing we need.

29:24.160 --> 29:28.517
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

29:29.120 --> 29:33.318
-But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
-lf I'd let him fight Menelaus for her. . .

29:33.480 --> 29:36.472
. . .you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.108
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.999
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.031
What would you have me do?

29:44.640 --> 29:47.438
Put her on a ship and send her home.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.391
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.118
But this is different.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.510
Something has changed in him.

29:57.680 --> 30:01.355
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.038
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.590
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.590
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.910
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.640
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.431
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.993
Father, we can't win this war.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.070
Apollo watches over us.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.677
Even Agamemnon
is no match for the gods.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.479
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.039
Do not mock the gods.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.592
They're coming for me.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.712
The wind is bringing them closer.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.472
What if we left?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.710
Tonight. Right now.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.189
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

30:55.400 --> 30:57.231
Ride east, keep riding.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.480
-And go where?
-Away from here.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.270
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.359
But this is your home.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.557
You left your home for me.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.590
Sparta was never my home.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.993
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.912
But it was never my home.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.798
We'll live off the land.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.396
No more palaces for us. No more
servants. We don't need any of that.

31:27.560 --> 31:28.834
And your family?

31:29.000 --> 31:32.675
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

31:32.840 --> 31:36.469
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.349
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.476
You don't know Menelaus.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.193
You don't know his brother.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.716
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.876
They'll never believe we've left.

31:51.560 --> 31:55.030
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.629
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.760
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.791
You're very young, my love.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.153
Look at that.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.188
Take up your positions!

34:41.800 --> 34:43.074
My lord?

34:44.679 --> 34:46.591
Should we wait for the others?

34:47.480 --> 34:50.677
-They brought us here for war.
-Yes, but Agamemnon's orders--

34:50.840 --> 34:53.195
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

34:53.360 --> 34:54.634
For you, my lord.

34:54.800 --> 34:59.032
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.394
Black sail.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.198
It's Achilles.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.839
What's the fool doing?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.759
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

35:17.040 --> 35:18.917
Make way there! Make way!

35:29.440 --> 35:32.637
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.997
-Waiting at the city gates.
-Good. I'll be right there.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.473
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.712
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them--

35:42.880 --> 35:44.313
-How long?
-Noon.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.038
Make it sooner.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.272
Patroclus!

36:02.040 --> 36:03.632
Put down your spear.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.791
-I'm fighting the Trojans.
-Not today.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.916
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.829
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.953
Look at these men.

36:15.120 --> 36:19.272
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.351
-Guard the ship.
-But this is a war.

36:21.520 --> 36:25.638
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.638
Trojans!

36:50.440 --> 36:53.273
All my life, I've lived by a code.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.516
And the code is simple:

36:55.760 --> 36:58.399
Honor the gods, love your woman. . .

36:59.200 --> 37:00.599
. . .and defend your country.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.717
Troy is mother to us all.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.474
Fight for her!

37:25.160 --> 37:27.037
Myrmidons. . .

37:27.840 --> 37:29.512
. . .my brothers of the sword.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.190
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.477
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

37:41.200 --> 37:45.796
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

37:45.960 --> 37:48.997
lmmortality! Take it! It's yours!

38:01.480 --> 38:03.357
Fight positions!

38:05.680 --> 38:07.398
Archers!

38:25.240 --> 38:26.878
Forward!

38:49.000 --> 38:51.036
The man wants to die.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.999
On my command!

39:18.880 --> 39:20.632
Break off! Break off!

39:58.600 --> 39:59.874
Look at him.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.874
Look.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.876
Row, you lazy whores, row!

40:07.160 --> 40:09.879
Greeks are dying! Row!

40:36.160 --> 40:39.232
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.468
Flank! To the flank!

41:29.040 --> 41:32.157
Achilles! Achilles!

42:04.480 --> 42:07.597
Back to the city! Back to the city!

42:14.680 --> 42:18.275
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.000
Take whatever treasure you can find.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.638
With your permission, my lord.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.193
-Speak.
-Apollo sees everything.

42:35.360 --> 42:38.033
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.233
Warn the men.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.918
Wait.

44:32.880 --> 44:36.873
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.832
You must be Hector.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.474
Do you know who I am?

44:47.680 --> 44:49.318
These priests weren't armed.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.276
Fight me!

45:01.320 --> 45:03.629
Why kill you now, prince of Troy. . .

45:03.800 --> 45:06.234
. . .with no one here to see you fall?

45:16.200 --> 45:17.394
Why did you come here?

45:17.600 --> 45:20.194
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.238
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.755
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.834
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.798
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.351
You speak of war as if it's a game.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.195
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

45:50.360 --> 45:51.839
Your brother can comfort them.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.037
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.352
My lord, you let him go?

46:12.360 --> 46:15.033
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.191
Achilles! Achilles!

47:19.160 --> 47:21.515
-Achilles.
-Ajax.

47:22.040 --> 47:26.431
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.953
As am I.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.110
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.840
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.196
I've got something to show you.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.558
The men found her
hiding in the temple.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.279
They thought she'd. . .

48:01.400 --> 48:02.913
. . .amuse you.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.279
What's your name?

48:19.400 --> 48:21.038
Did you not hear me?

48:22.400 --> 48:23.992
You killed Apollo's priests.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.674
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.637
Well, then your men did.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.831
The sun god will have his vengeance.

48:31.480 --> 48:32.754
What's he waiting for?

48:32.920 --> 48:35.036
The right time to strike.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.198
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.920
-I think your god is afraid of me.
-Afraid?

48:42.080 --> 48:45.117
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.840
-Where is he?
-You're nothing but a killer!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.639
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

48:52.280 --> 48:55.238
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.273
I've seen them.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.118
You're royalty, aren't you?

49:06.800 --> 49:09.030
Spent years talking down to men.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.632
You must be royalty.

49:16.800 --> 49:18.153
What's your name?

49:23.720 --> 49:26.280
Even the servants of Apollo
have names.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.712
Briseis.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.151
Are you afraid, Briseis?

49:35.200 --> 49:36.633
Should I be?

49:40.160 --> 49:41.593
My lord.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.319
Agamemnon requests your presence.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.633
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.638
You fought well today.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.638
My lord.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.436
What do you want here in Troy?

50:04.360 --> 50:06.316
You didn't come
for the Spartan queen.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.152
I want what all men want.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.232
I just want it more.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.391
You don't need to fear me, girl.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.470
You're the only Trojan
who can say that.

50:52.120 --> 50:55.396
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

50:56.200 --> 51:00.318
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.070
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

51:03.680 --> 51:08.708
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

51:12.320 --> 51:16.393
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.312
I present it to you. . .

51:18.560 --> 51:21.279
. . .in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.038
Thank you, old friend.

51:23.680 --> 51:27.355
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.634
Leave us.

51:42.520 --> 51:46.877
War is young men dying
and old men talking. You know this.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.031
Ignore the politics.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.591
Apparently, you won
some great victory.

52:07.760 --> 52:13.232
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

52:13.400 --> 52:16.153
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.515
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

52:18.680 --> 52:19.954
No.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.795
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.758
A great victory was won today.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.475
But that victory is not yours.

52:30.640 --> 52:33.074
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

52:33.320 --> 52:36.153
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.869
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.235
History remembers kings!

52:42.680 --> 52:44.352
Not soldiers.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.868
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.679
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.957
I'll carve " Agamemnon" in the stone.

52:55.120 --> 52:58.874
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.709
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

53:05.880 --> 53:07.472
You want gold? Take it.

53:07.640 --> 53:10.552
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.551
I already have.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.472
Aphareus!

53:17.120 --> 53:18.394
Haemon!

53:26.840 --> 53:28.114
The spoils of war.

53:28.280 --> 53:32.114
No argument wit you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.714
-Decide.
-Guards!

53:36.120 --> 53:37.633
Stop!

53:39.920 --> 53:41.797
Too many men have died today.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.078
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.874
I don't want anyone dying for me.

53:57.320 --> 54:03.031
Mighty Achilles,
silenced by a slave girl.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.792
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.718
And then. . .

54:11.520 --> 54:14.080
-. . .who knows?
-You sack of wine!

54:16.640 --> 54:20.792
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.916
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

54:39.400 --> 54:43.996
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

54:44.760 --> 54:48.469
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.392
Glaucus.

54:51.840 --> 54:55.469
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

54:55.640 --> 54:58.234
Our walls have never been breached.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.635
We have the finest archers
in the world.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.871
And we have Hector.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.759
Yes, we can win.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.670
I spoke to two farmers today.

55:14.080 --> 55:18.835
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.392
This is a sign from Apollo.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.676
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.353
Bird signs.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.279
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

55:29.440 --> 55:30.873
Hector, show respect.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.953
The high priest
is a servant of the gods.

55:34.120 --> 55:36.395
And I am a servant of Troy.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.630
I've always honored the gods, Father.

55:39.800 --> 55:43.713
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.916
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

55:46.920 --> 55:49.514
The gods won't fight this war for us.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.477
There won't be a war.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.271
This is not a conflict of nations.

55:58.440 --> 56:00.590
It is a dispute between two men.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.113
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

56:04.280 --> 56:05.918
Paris.

56:07.080 --> 56:10.550
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.998
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

56:33.440 --> 56:34.953
Father. . .

56:36.120 --> 56:38.680
. . .I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.271
Do you love her?

56:43.840 --> 56:47.913
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.192
Every blade of grass.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.031
Every grain of sand.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.719
Every rock in the river.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.915
You love all of Troy.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.437
That is the way I love Helen.

57:05.760 --> 57:08.718
I've fought many wars in my time.

57:10.080 --> 57:13.470
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

57:15.480 --> 57:20.759
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.673
But I won't be the one fighting.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.552
The sword of Troy.

57:29.240 --> 57:32.755
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him. . .

57:32.920 --> 57:35.434
. . .all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

57:35.600 --> 57:39.559
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.910
Carry it with you tomorrow.

57:47.360 --> 57:50.193
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

57:51.440 --> 57:54.432
So long as a Trojan carries it. . .

57:55.000 --> 57:57.468
. . .our people have a future.

58:01.160 --> 58:04.277
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple. . .

58:05.200 --> 58:07.839
. . .I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

58:08.960 --> 58:10.757
An impossible throw.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.598
Don't go tomorrow.

58:18.560 --> 58:21.199
-Please don't go.
-Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

58:21.360 --> 58:25.035
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross
the sea to watch your brother fight.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.553
You know this.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.517
You'd make a fine general, my love.

58:28.680 --> 58:33.071
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

58:33.240 --> 58:37.756
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

58:37.920 --> 58:40.309
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.276
I can't lose you.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.518
I won't survive.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.512
I must see Paris.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.559
Wait.

59:13.480 --> 59:14.879
Wait!

59:20.080 --> 59:21.433
Helen, what are you doing?

59:21.600 --> 59:23.636
-Let me go.
-No.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.630
I saw them burn.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.434
I saw them burning on the pyres.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.158
That's my fault.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.515
It is. You know it is.

59:45.640 --> 59:47.358
All those widows.

59:48.400 --> 59:50.595
I still hear them screaming.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.237
Their husbands died because I'm here.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.718
I'm going down to the ships.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.472
No, you're not.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.150
-I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
-It's too late for that.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.232
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.789
This is about power. Not love.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.151
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.074
-Yes.
-Menelaus will kill him.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.593
I won't let that happen.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.031
-It's his decision.
-No.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.914
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.510
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.910
You're a princess of Troy now. . .

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.674
. . .and my brother needs you tonight.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.912
My lord.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.791
My lord, the army is marching.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.514
-Let them march. We stay.
-But the men are ready.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.399
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.554
As you wish.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.953
Are you ready to fight?

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.755
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.392
I am.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.995
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.311
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.472
They're waiting for me.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.471
They say, " Welcome, brother. "

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.237
We men are wretched things.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.709
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.154
I fight for you.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.231
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.077
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.634
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.119
Soldiers obey.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.951
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.279
Go.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.637
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.358
I started this war.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.071
Helen. . .

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.753
. . .sit with me.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.678
Prepare to halt!

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.512
Prepare to halt!

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.353
Halt!

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.512
Move.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.672
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.559
Ill-advised, but valiant.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.315
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.391
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.915
Prince? What prince?

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.799
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality. . .

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.112
. . .eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.431
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.993
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.310
I want her to watch you die.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.554
Not yet, brother.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.278
Look around you, Hector.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.876
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.951
You can still save Troy, young prince.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.519
I have two wishes.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.877
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.918
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.517
Second, Troy must submit
to my command. . .

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.274
. . .to fight for me whenever I call.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.352
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.993
Well, I see them.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:33.996
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.078
Careful, boy.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:41.997
My mercy has limits.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.469
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.917
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:52.278
Then every son of Troy shall die.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.991
There is another way.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.555
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.952
So let us fight our own battle.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.795
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.395
A brave offer, but not enough.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.511
Let me kill this little peacock.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.231
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.550
I came for my honor.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.075
His every breath insults me.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.910
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.117
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.839
So be it.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.118
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.317
-My lord.
-Back to the line!

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.550
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.519
Brother. . .

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.592
. . .if I fall, tell Helen-- Tell her--

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.432
I will.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.591
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he--

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.036
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.352
Get up.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.358
Come on.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.199
See the crows?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.116
They never tasted prince before.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.278
Is this what you left me for?!

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.032
Fight!

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.634
Fight me!

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.954
You coward!

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.348
Fight me!

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.795
We have a pact! Fight!

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.153
Fight him, son. Fight him.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.949
-Fight me!
-The Trojans have violated the agreement!

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.554
Prepare for battle!

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.519
This is not honor!

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.109
This is not worthy of royalty!

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.478
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.434
The fight is over.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.670
The fight is not over.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.478
Stand back, Prince Hector.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.154
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.594
He is my brother.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.792
Paris!

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.238
Go!

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.552
Get inside, Paris!

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.354
Archers!

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.990
-Our men are too close to the walls.
-Pull back, you fool!

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.434
For Troy!

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.435
-Now!
-Loose!

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.033
Get them in line!

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.958
Get the men back into lines!

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.395
Front line, push!

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.553
Forward.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.994
Forward!

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.834
Forward!

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.235
Apollonians! Now!

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.794
Prince Hector!

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.828
We need to retreat!

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.910
My army's never lost a battle yet!

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.469
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.350
Back to the ships!

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.158
-Back to the ships!
-Retreat!

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.309
-Back!
-Retreat!

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.118
Go back!

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.079
Back. Back to the ships!

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.953
Fall back!

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.714
-Men, fall back!
-Halt!

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.039
Halt!

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.679
But we have them on the run!

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.956
We're in range of their archers.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.951
Have our men gather our fallen.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.918
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.469
Would they have done the same for us?

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.878
Go! Back!

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.318
Fall back into line!

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.552
You think I'm a coward.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.358
I am a coward.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.871
I knew he would kill me.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.159
You were watching.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.553
My father.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.238
My brother.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.995
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.437
I gave up my pride. . .

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.752
. . .my honor. . .

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.153
. . .just to live.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.159
For love.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.316
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.118
I betrayed you.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.710
Menelaus was a brave man.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.757
He lived for fighting.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.513
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.631
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.714
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.873
They think I'll sail home at first light.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.359
Maybe we should.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.715
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.350
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.118
Won't be needing her anymore.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.317
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.040
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.192
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.638
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.078
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.356
To protect Greece, not your pride.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.080
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.514
Achilles is one man.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.955
Hector is one man.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.959
Look what he did to us today.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.829
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.636
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.233
He's right.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.913
The men's morale is weak.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.790
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.798
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.394
I'll talk to him.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.959
He'll want the girl back.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.759
He can have that damn girl.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.194
I haven't touched her.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.634
Where is she?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.432
I gave her to the men.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.511
They need some amusement after today.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.635
Come on, give the bitch to me!

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.719
Who's first?

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.759
Trojan whore!

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.831
What's this? A virgin's robe?

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.038
-You won't be needing that much longer!
-Hold her.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.556
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan--

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.676
Achilles!

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.872
Are you hurt?

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.110
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.637
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.593
Eat.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.559
I've known men like you my whole life.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.074
No, you haven't.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.879
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.389
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.910
-And you hate these soldiers.
-I pity them.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.394
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.552
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.952
Why did you choose this life?

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.588
-What life?
-To be a great warrior.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.555
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.992
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.758
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.792
Do you enjoy provoking me?

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.670
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.310
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.914
-Yes, of course.
-And Ares, god of war?

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.958
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.319
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.553
I'll tell you a secret. . .

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.680
. . .something they don't teach you
in your temple.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.035
The gods envy us.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.750
They envy us because we're mortal.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.958
Because any moment might be our last.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.391
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.398
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.192
We will never be here again.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.231
I thought you were a dumb brute.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.591
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.114
Do it.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.799
Nothing is easier.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.234
Aren't you afraid?

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.791
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.118
Do it.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.710
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.393
Many.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.633
My lord, there's--

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.509
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.992
Gather the stores.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.109
Agamemnon is a proud man.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.469
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.790
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.434
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.595
The world seems simple to you,
my friend. . .

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:28.116
. . .but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.759
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.512
Are we supposed to fear him?

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:39.356
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.833
We need you back.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.758
Greece needs you.

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.119
Greece got along fine before I was born.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.430
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.551
I'm not talking about the land.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.836
The men need you.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.679
Stay, Achilles.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.278
You were born for this war.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.638
Things are less simple today.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.633
Women have a way
of complicating things.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.357
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.511
But in this war, you're a servant.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.672
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.873
I hope you understand that one day.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.677
We're going home?

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.239
We sail in the morning.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.710
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.634
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.074
These are our countrymen.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.118
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.272
Someone has to lose.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.119
The gods favor our cause.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.238
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.909
Their morale is battered.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.117
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.032
And they will run.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.915
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.798
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.520
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.111
If they decide to attack us, let them.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.113
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.429
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.396
We should not return the favor.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:58.079
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.630
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.633
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.360
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.391
Am I still your captive?

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.673
You're my guest.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.152
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.912
You should leave then.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.511
Would you leave this all behind?

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.392
Would you leave Troy?

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.632
Hold those barricades!

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.517
Archers to the rear.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.430
Achilles.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.592
Achilles.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.953
Now!

01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.913
Forward!

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.833
Enough for one day.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.672
Yes.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.033
Back to the ships!

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.509
Back to the ships!

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.912
It was his cousin.

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.599
To Troy!

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.313
-Back to the city!
-Back to the city!

01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.799
To Troy!

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.870
We were going to sail home today.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.160
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.637
Achilles.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.117
You violated my command.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.510
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.114
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.316
You led them into combat.

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.239
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.630
Where's Patroclus?

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.392
Patroclus!

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.710
We thought he was you, my lord.

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:18.956
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.838
He even moved like you.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.271
Where is he?

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.837
-Where?
-He's dead, my lord.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.753
Hector cut his throat.

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.035
Don't!

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.272
Where are you taking me?

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.757
Do you remember how to get here?

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.872
Yes.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.992
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:36.232
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.789
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.269
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.032
Why are you telling me this?

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.551
-lf I die. . .
-No.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.234
. . .I don't know how long
the city will stand.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.994
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:59.391
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.835
-Please.
-The women, they'll take as slaves.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.709
-That, for you, will be worse than dying.
-Why are you saying such things?

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.918
Because I want you to be ready.

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.673
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.237
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.392
I killed a boy today.

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.832
And he was young.

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.712
He was much too young.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.680
That boy has just saved this war for us.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.670
-Eudorus.
-My lord.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.512
I need my armor.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.473
No.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:39.994
Don't go!

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.756
Rope!

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.195
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.397
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.631
Please.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.274
No.

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.231
Hector!

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.838
Hector!

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.317
Hector!

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.553
Hector!

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.117
Father. . .

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.555
. . .forgive me for any offenses.

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.470
I've served you as best as I could.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.632
Hector!

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.035
May the gods be with you.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.718
Hector.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.237
No father ever had a better son.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.153
Hector!

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.598
Apollo guard you, my prince.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.913
You're the best man I know.

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.677
You're a prince of Troy.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.879
I know you'll make me proud.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.840
Hector!

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.230
Remember what I told you.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.878
You don't have to go. You don't.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.878
You remember what I told you.

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.749
Hector!

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.108
Hector!

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:01.120
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.439
I'll make a pact with you.

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.356
With the gods as our witnesses. . .

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.991
. . .let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.038
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.915
Now you know who you're fighting.

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:35.799
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:39.954
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.031
You gave him the honor of your sword.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.751
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:49.913
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:53.755
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:48.154
Get up, prince of Troy.

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.513
Get up. I won't let
a stone take my glory.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.477
You lost your cousin.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.992
Now you've taken mine.

01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.878
When does it end?

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:33.472
It never ends.

02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.873
Who are you?

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:35.672
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:41.394
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:49.752
Priam?

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:52.399
How did you get in here?

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.348
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:02.995
You're a brave man.

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.957
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:12.949
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.108
I watched my eldest son die. . .

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.989
. . .watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.830
Give him back to me.

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.793
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.236
Give him to me.

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.312
He killed my cousin.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.391
He thought it was you.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.474
How many cousins have you killed?

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.669
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.349
How many, brave Achilles?

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:55.231
I knew your father.

02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.550
He died before his time.

02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.754
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:12.000
You have taken everything from me.

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.759
My eldest son. . .

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:18.118
. . .heir to my throne. . .

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.437
. . .defender of my kingdom.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:26.831
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.277
But give me this small mercy.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.955
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes. . .

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.157
. . .till the moment you closed them.

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:45.358
Let me wash his body.

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.997
Let me say the prayers.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.876
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.630
If I let you walk out of here. . .

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.717
. . .if I let you take him. . .

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:11.196
. . .it doesn't change anything.

02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:15.280
You're still my enemy in the morning.

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:19.272
You're still my enemy tonight.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.716
But even enemies can show respect.

02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:43.999
I admire your courage.

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.078
Meet me outside in a moment.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.878
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:55.829
Your son was the best I've fought.

02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.480
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.831
It is the same in my country.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.070
Then the prince will have that honor.

02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.596
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.799
Briseis?

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.035
I thought you were dead.

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.554
You are free.

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:49.118
If I hurt you. . .

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.350
. . .it's not what I wanted.

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:08.879
Go.

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.077
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.398
Come, my girl.

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:26.149
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.357
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:50.559
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:52.756
Peace!

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.634
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.552
This is the time to attack!

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.679
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:04.434
I will smash their walls to the ground. . .

02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.068
. . .if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:09.754
Hear me, Zeus!

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:14.152
I will smash their walls to the ground.

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:27.993
That's good.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.191
For my son back home.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.199
Well, Odysseus.

02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:01.631
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.155
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:24.358
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.480
I hope I never disappoint you again.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:31.189
It's I who have been the disappointment.

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.360
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.592
Aren't you coming with us?

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.476
I have my own battle to fight.

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.552
Let me march beside you.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.793
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.992
It's a beautiful night.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.837
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:06.312
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.632
Open the gates!

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.992
Here.

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.872
Plague.

02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:59.988
Don't go too close, my king.

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.710
This is the will of the gods.

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.871
They desecrated the temple of Apollo. . .

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.713
. . .and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.668
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:15.515
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.638
What is this?

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.476
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.470
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.871
-I think we should burn it.
-Burn it?

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.196
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.789
Father, burn it.

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.639
Look at them.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.435
You'd think their prince had never died.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:45.511
You are the prince now.

02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:48.196
Make your brother proud.

02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:18.512
Briseis. Where is she?

02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:20.830
-Where?
-I don't know.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.672
Please. I have a son.

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.475
Then get him out of Troy.

02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:40.954
Briseis!

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.638
Paris! Andromache!

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.752
Helen. We must go.

02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.672
-Where?
-I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:33.558
Paris.

02:17:33.719 --> 02:17:36.154
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:37.878
Briseis!

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.638
Paris!

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.951
Let it burn!

02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.350
Let Troy burn!

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.717
Burn it! Burn it all!

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.236
Burn Troy!

02:18:05.639 --> 02:18:07.915
Burn Troy!

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.596
It's a long way. Quick.

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:15.833
-Come.
-I stay.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.150
-No.
-My father will never abandon the city.

02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.638
I can't leave him.

02:18:19.799 --> 02:18:23.156
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

02:18:24.639 --> 02:18:26.709
-What's your name?
-Aeneas.

02:18:26.879 --> 02:18:29.758
-Do you know how to use a sword?
-Yes.

02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:31.831
The sword of Troy.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.389
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

02:18:35.559 --> 02:18:38.028
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:39.832
-I will.
-Hurry.

02:18:40.719 --> 02:18:43.029
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:44.633
I'll find her.

02:18:46.959 --> 02:18:48.552
Go.

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:50.871
-I'll stay with you.
-Go.

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:52.359
Please don't leave me.

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.431
How could you love me if I ran now?

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.037
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:06.798
Go.

02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:12.309
To the gate!

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.031
Soldiers of Troy. . .

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:27.514
. . .you men are warriors!

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:30.240
To lead you has been my honor!

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.549
My prince!

02:19:34.559 --> 02:19:36.437
The boatman waits for us.

02:19:36.639 --> 02:19:39.995
I say we make him wait a little longer!

02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.153
Paris!

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.517
Paris!

02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.391
Have you no honor?

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:43.958
Have you no honor?

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:16.834
Too late for prayer, priestess.

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:27.990
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:43.194
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:47.512
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:50.754
And at night. . . .

02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.392
Get up!

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:10.357
Hold her.

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:19.434
Come with me.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.479
No!

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.592
Paris!

02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:37.074
No!

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.078
Stop! Please!

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.630
Paris! Don't!

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:23.873
It's all right.

02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:26.277
It's all right.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.877
You gave me peace. . .

02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.596
. . .in a lifetime of war.

02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:53.273
Briseis, come.

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:54.913
Go.

02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.194
You must.

02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:59.073
No.

02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:00.992
Troy is falling.

02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.312
Go.

02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:09.757
We must go. I know a way out.

02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:15.114
It's all right.

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.158
Go.

02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:26.349
Briseis, come.

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.317
Go.

02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:55.838
Find peace. . .

02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:58.193
. . .my brother.

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:14.997
If they ever tell my story, let them say...

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:17.549
...I walked with giants.

02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:21.510
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:24.075
...but these names will never die.

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:29.510
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.716
... tamer of horses.

02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:33.951
Let them say...

02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.635
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
