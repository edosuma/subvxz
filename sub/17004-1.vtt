WEBVTT

00:19.361 --> 00:23.025
So you weren't kidding when you
said we were going fishing, huh?

00:23.156 --> 00:25.113
That's what I said, darn it!

00:25.909 --> 00:29.027
Look, this is boring.
Let's go swimming or something.

00:29.162 --> 00:32.906
It's cold. Besides, we passed
a sewer outlet on the way here.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.454
Please!
They don't dump the sewers in this lake!

00:35.586 --> 00:37.578
- They get the water from it.
- Whoa! Hey!

00:37.713 --> 00:40.581
There's something slimy down there.
I don't like it.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.298
Oh, you're trying to scare me.

00:42.426 --> 00:46.045
- Hey!
- Oh! Wayne?

00:46.888 --> 00:48.220
Come on, Wayne.

00:50.309 --> 00:52.801
Cut it out. You're crazy.

00:54.895 --> 00:57.980
Wayne... Wayne?

01:00.736 --> 01:04.275
Wayne, you're making me nervous. Come on.

01:04.406 --> 01:06.443
Will you just stop kidding around?

01:10.329 --> 01:12.366
If you don't stop,
I'm just gonna row away.

01:13.457 --> 01:14.948
Come on, Wayne.

03:12.951 --> 03:14.988
Move it, scumbag!

03:16.120 --> 03:18.321
You son of a bitch!

03:19.249 --> 03:21.286
Son of a bitch!

03:21.418 --> 03:23.831
Hey, hey, Case, come over here.
Come here, Casey.

03:23.962 --> 03:26.921
You're a good dog.
You see that, Casey? Did you see that?

03:27.048 --> 03:30.382
Them goddamn kids could've killed me,
but they didn't. I survived.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.376
Come on, we'll grab a couple of snorts,

03:32.512 --> 03:35.004
and you'll cry on my shoulder,
and I'll cry on yours.

03:35.140 --> 03:38.349
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on.

03:38.477 --> 03:40.139
Come on, come on.

03:54.618 --> 03:56.575
Oh, oh, OK.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.827
You want a swig, huh? You want a swig?

04:11.092 --> 04:13.675
Come on in. What's the matter?
You don't like my house?

04:13.804 --> 04:15.920
It ain't good enough for you, huh?

04:16.015 --> 04:19.127
Oh, shut up, you goddamn mongrel!

04:32.113 --> 04:35.572
"Eviction notice. Last warning."

04:35.700 --> 04:37.737
You assholes.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.362
Shit! Ugh!

05:36.761 --> 05:40.675
No, no! No! Get off! Not at me! No!

05:41.349 --> 05:43.636
Hey, don't spill any, buddy.

05:45.896 --> 05:48.684
- Just in time.
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.

05:50.108 --> 05:52.441
- Your beer, sir.
- Thank you.

05:53.737 --> 05:56.525
- Mmm.
- Come on, Maureen.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.272
Slow up a little, eh?

05:58.408 --> 06:01.025
Excuse me for trying to have a good time.

06:03.204 --> 06:05.196
- You wanna dance?
- Uh-uh.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.370
What about you, Mike? Wanna boogie?

06:08.501 --> 06:12.120
Oh, no thanks, Maureen.
I'm not much of a dancer.

06:12.255 --> 06:14.372
- That's for sure.
- Terrific!

06:14.507 --> 06:17.966
Another fun-filled night in Ashton. Hmm!

06:18.094 --> 06:22.805
The armpit of America and centre
of boredom for planet Earth, right, honey?

06:22.933 --> 06:25.971
- I think we better go.
- You know, I think you're right.

06:26.102 --> 06:29.391
I've got to see Sheriff Reese
in the morning at Ron Bell's house.

06:30.231 --> 06:31.563
- See you all.
- Bye.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.978
- See you, Mike. Bye, Kim.
- Good night.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.401
- Mike!
- Hey, Don! How are you?

06:40.533 --> 06:42.650
I'm fine.
You guys aren't leaving, are you?

06:42.786 --> 06:46.279
Yeah, I've got an early appointment
first thing in the morning.

06:46.414 --> 06:48.747
Oh, Don, this is my wife, Kim. Kim, Don.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.707
- How do you do, Kim?
- Nice to meet you.

06:50.835 --> 06:53.168
- And this is my wife, Maria.
- Hello.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.710
Hi, Maria. Nice to see you. Uh,
Don's our county sanitation supervisor.

06:56.841 --> 06:58.173
Uh-huh.

06:58.301 --> 07:02.261
Which is just a college-educated way
of saying that I crawl round in sewers,

07:02.389 --> 07:06.224
and that I get paid about a quarter
of what I made as a plumber.

07:06.351 --> 07:08.092
Good to meet you.

07:08.228 --> 07:12.188
Funny, but you don't look anything
like the Wicked Bitch of the North to me.

07:12.315 --> 07:13.897
What?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.600
I'm Rick and Danny's mother.

07:17.195 --> 07:21.109
Oh! Oh, oh. They're in my junior
and senior classes.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.732
They don't like my homework.

07:22.867 --> 07:26.326
- You're sure I can't buy you a drink?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

07:26.454 --> 07:29.037
- We'll see you all later.
- Good night. Nice to see you.

07:29.165 --> 07:30.952
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

07:33.169 --> 07:35.377
- Michael?
- Yeah?

07:35.505 --> 07:37.212
Do you think Maureen's attractive?

07:37.340 --> 07:39.297
She drinks too much.

07:40.635 --> 07:42.126
That's not what I mean.

07:44.889 --> 07:46.221
Do you like?

07:46.349 --> 07:49.217
Yeah. Very much.

07:49.352 --> 07:55.268
Mmm. Also, don't forget I'm known
as the Wicked Bitch of the North.

07:56.399 --> 07:58.492
I won't forget.

07:59.904 --> 08:02.988
- So, Teacher...
- Mmm...

08:04.951 --> 08:07.718
What do you say we start our homework?

08:41.361 --> 08:45.527
Mary Anne, I can't just drop everything
here, and come home to kill a few snails.

08:46.367 --> 08:50.077
Snails, slugs. What the hell's the
difference? Baby, I'll see you tonight.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.281
- Morning, Mr Brady.
- Good morning, Dobbs.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.078
You're late, Brady.

08:55.210 --> 08:56.951
Uh, go right in.

09:00.673 --> 09:03.541
Give me a break, Sheriff.
It's two minutes after eight.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.386
That's right, son. After eight.
Our appointment was for eight o'clock.

09:07.514 --> 09:11.224
I got a lot more important things to do
than spend my time evicting drunks.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.183
Great. I get your point.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.970
Let's take my car.

09:26.658 --> 09:28.991
Sheriff, you don't mind
if I smoke, do you?

09:29.119 --> 09:30.860
I sure as hell do, Brady.

09:30.995 --> 09:35.035
You can muck up your own lungs,
but don't mess with mine, goddamnit.

09:37.502 --> 09:40.711
- Today's your lucky day, Brady.
- Oh, really? Why's that?

09:40.839 --> 09:44.708
Littering's a $500 fine in this state.
Don't let me catch you doing it again.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.132
Sheriff, you know what they found
in those candies you're eating?

09:49.264 --> 09:51.551
Rat shit and maggots' eggs.

09:51.683 --> 09:55.420
Oh, but Sheriff, littering!
It's a $500 fine.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.780
Son of a bitch.

10:46.905 --> 10:49.397
It doesn't even look like
anyone lives here.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.444
We'll see about that.

10:56.164 --> 10:57.655
There's an open window.

11:11.804 --> 11:15.013
Whew. Look at all this shit.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.351
Man, what stinks like that?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.266
Oh, my God.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.417
Saw nothing like it before.
Not even in 'Nam.

11:43.544 --> 11:46.036
Something ate the sucker's eyes right out.

11:46.172 --> 11:50.507
Not only that, the coroner said his liver,
kidneys and heart are all gone, too.

11:51.427 --> 11:53.760
- Dobbs, get out of my sight!
- Huh?

11:53.888 --> 11:56.175
I said get lost! Damn it!

11:59.227 --> 12:02.140
Sheriff... I'm gonna go back in there.

12:03.231 --> 12:04.722
OK, but don't touch anything.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.454
So, Sheriff, what do you think?

13:06.586 --> 13:11.206
I don't know. Wild dogs maybe. Racoons
driven out of the hills by the cold.

13:11.341 --> 13:12.673
I don't buy that.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.714
Something that big would've done a lot
more damage to the inside of the house.

13:16.846 --> 13:19.213
What's your bright idea,
Mr Health Inspector?

13:20.058 --> 13:22.516
Oh, rats maybe.

13:22.643 --> 13:25.010
Rats?
You willing to go on record with that?

13:25.146 --> 13:28.355
How can I do that?
I'm not sure that it's rats.

13:28.483 --> 13:31.976
Well, there's finally something
you're not sure of. Fancy that!

13:38.576 --> 13:42.946
Excuse me, Mr Brady. Sorry, but it's
that woman on the phone again for you.

13:43.081 --> 13:46.495
- What woman?
- Florence Fortune. Called four times.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.958
What does she want?

13:48.086 --> 13:50.419
Something about the sewers
being backed up.

13:50.546 --> 13:54.586
Oh, Jesus! Now since when are
the goddamn sewers my business?

13:54.717 --> 13:58.006
Tell her to...
to call the Sanitation Department.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.049
Those guys get paid just like we do.

14:00.181 --> 14:03.845
I'm not an idiot, Mr Brady. I've already
told her that, but she won't listen.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.844
All right, I'm sorry.
Put her on the phone.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.393
Yeah. Yes, it's Mike Brady.

14:15.446 --> 14:16.903
Yes, ma'am.

14:18.241 --> 14:19.857
No, ma'am.

14:20.743 --> 14:23.907
Why don't you just give me
your address then, OK?

14:36.759 --> 14:39.627
- She called the Health Department, too?
- You got it?

14:39.762 --> 14:42.300
- Come on. I'll show you how to do this.
- Great.

14:42.432 --> 14:44.674
- It's gonna be a piece of cake.
- Oh, yeah.

14:44.809 --> 14:47.096
- Hi, ma'am...
- You took your sweet time!

14:47.228 --> 14:49.971
- Hi, Mike Brady. I'd...
- I don't care who you are.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.098
I want something done about that smell.

14:52.233 --> 14:55.226
I'm not on welfare. I pay my taxes.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.774
Do you suppose
we could start at the beginning?

14:57.905 --> 15:01.069
We can start anywhere you want, young man.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.783
As long as we end up getting results!

15:07.874 --> 15:10.412
Didn't you hear about it? It was awful.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.707
Whatever got him
ate his eyes right out of his head.

15:13.838 --> 15:17.832
Or what used to be his head.
His face was all bloody...

15:17.967 --> 15:21.256
For God sakes, Madge, that's enough.
I don't wanna hear any more.

15:21.387 --> 15:24.846
So, we're done. Are you going off
to the moon or going down in the sewer?

15:24.974 --> 15:28.183
You'd be...
You'd be surprised at the similarities.

15:28.311 --> 15:31.554
There's more methane down there
than there is on some of the planets.

15:31.689 --> 15:34.306
Mmm. That's why you got on
the cute mask, huh?

15:34.442 --> 15:36.058
That's one of the reasons.

15:40.448 --> 15:43.612
I've got another suit in the truck
if you wanna come down with me.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.577
Oh, no thanks.
I'm not big on the tight spaces.

15:46.704 --> 15:49.868
Ah, well, I guess that's why
they pay me the big bucks.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.615
I guess so.

16:17.318 --> 16:20.436
And what exactly do you do, hmm?

17:47.617 --> 17:52.203
Right, any thoughts on how Romeo and
Juliet might've solved their problems?

17:54.373 --> 17:55.489
Pam.

17:56.417 --> 18:00.161
Well, I think they should've talked
to their parents about it, you know.

18:00.296 --> 18:03.130
Like, if they would have been honest
with their feelings,

18:03.257 --> 18:05.419
maybe their parents would have understood.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.544
- Fat chance.
- You have something to add, Donna?

18:09.096 --> 18:11.463
Oh, no, Mrs Brady.

18:12.475 --> 18:16.640
Well... parents never seem
to listen to their kids,

18:16.771 --> 18:20.765
unless it's when we're agreeing
with something they've just said.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.233
Hold on. Not so fast.

18:23.361 --> 18:26.820
I want Act Ill read by tomorrow,
and be prepared for a ten-minute quiz.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.112
The Wicked Bitch strikes again.

19:02.983 --> 19:05.145
- Hi, beautiful. How are you?
- Hi, honey.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.695
- All right.
- Where's for lunch?

19:08.823 --> 19:11.907
Well, I had one hell of a morning,
and I'm not too hungry.

19:12.034 --> 19:14.868
Besides, I've gotta check
these new houses after we eat.

19:16.914 --> 19:20.749
Oh, I heard about Ron Bell.
Do you wanna talk about it?

19:20.876 --> 19:23.038
Not if you wanna enjoy your lunch,
I don't.

19:36.767 --> 19:40.886
# You're with me every single day
and every night

19:41.021 --> 19:44.105
# I dream of when you're gone... #

19:46.360 --> 19:49.319
- I got a C.
- You got a C? I got a D.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.613
Those kids hanging around here.

19:55.745 --> 19:59.659
I'm telling you guys. Are you listening?
Something evil got that old wino.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.998
It was the goat killer, I'm telling you.

20:02.126 --> 20:04.459
Don't start that goat killer shit again.

20:04.587 --> 20:06.579
It's not shit. He really exists.

20:06.714 --> 20:08.751
- Who exists?
- The goat killer.

20:08.883 --> 20:12.342
He comes down from the hills at night,
kills people and then he eats them.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.632
Oh, that's gross!

20:14.764 --> 20:16.551
You're on drugs, girl, I swear.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.548
Either that,
or you need professional help.

20:18.684 --> 20:22.974
Laugh if you want, but he's real,
and he got Ron Bell last night.

20:23.105 --> 20:26.143
- He got Ron Bell last night.
- I'm hungry, babe. Get me a burger.

20:26.275 --> 20:29.393
- Will you get me a burger too?
- You wanna a goat burger, babe?

20:29.528 --> 20:31.019
So what's on for tomorrow night?

20:31.155 --> 20:33.363
Some kids are going to a Halloween party.

20:33.491 --> 20:36.825
A Halloween party? I'm not going.
I don't like those wild parties.

20:36.952 --> 20:39.865
- Count me in. Do you wanna go?
- Sure. Why not?

20:39.997 --> 20:43.286
What about the midterm on Monday?
Mrs Brady's? Did you forget?

20:43.417 --> 20:47.707
So? You gonna let that wicked bitch
spoil all your fun? Come on!

20:47.838 --> 20:50.251
Well, we'll see.

20:51.091 --> 20:54.300
Oh, I love the way
you commit yourself to things, Pam!

20:56.263 --> 21:00.974
'Good afternoon. It's a bright
sunny day here in downtown Ashton.

21:01.101 --> 21:03.514
'The birds are singing. The sky's blue...'

21:03.646 --> 21:06.059
- Harold...
- What?

21:06.190 --> 21:09.774
I would just like to know what are these.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.234
Slugs' eggs.

21:11.695 --> 21:14.062
- What?
- Slugs.

21:14.198 --> 21:17.441
I don't care what they are.
Just get rid of them.

21:17.576 --> 21:21.160
And all the plants on the porch
are the same.

21:21.288 --> 21:23.371
Please take care of them.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.956
Get off my back.

21:25.084 --> 21:28.668
I can't stand to look at them
another second! Hmm!

21:30.381 --> 21:31.713
Oh, boy.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.125
Come on, Harold.

22:56.884 --> 22:58.876
...never leave you alone. Women!

23:01.805 --> 23:03.137
There.

23:08.270 --> 23:10.787
Gets more like her mother every day.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.464
Something's biting my hand!

23:57.035 --> 23:58.567
Jean!

24:19.382 --> 24:21.374
Jean!

24:22.136 --> 24:23.468
Jean!

24:23.595 --> 24:27.134
'And now over to the stadium
for today's big game,

24:27.266 --> 24:29.748
'the Ashton Lions versus the...'

24:42.114 --> 24:44.106
Jean!

24:49.009 --> 24:50.694
Jean!

25:03.093 --> 25:04.504
Harold! No!

25:35.167 --> 25:37.784
- How are you?
- Fine.

25:45.636 --> 25:47.753
Did you hear about Harold and Jean Morris?

25:47.888 --> 25:49.675
No. Why?

25:49.807 --> 25:51.969
- They're dead.
- Oh, come on now.

25:52.101 --> 25:53.512
Yeah, I heard it on the news.

25:53.644 --> 25:56.478
There was some kind of an explosion
in their greenhouse.

25:56.605 --> 25:57.937
They were both inside.

25:58.065 --> 25:59.931
Wait a second. How did this happen?

26:00.067 --> 26:01.899
Nobody knows.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.110
Oh, Jesus.

26:04.238 --> 26:07.948
They were nice people.
I... I mean, I liked them a lot.

26:08.075 --> 26:09.941
I know. I did too.

26:11.620 --> 26:14.363
- So what are you doing out here?
- Working in the garden.

26:14.498 --> 26:17.241
- Oh, I see! Now you call this a garden.
- Well...

26:18.836 --> 26:21.704
- What's wrong?
- You see these slime trails everywhere?

26:22.631 --> 26:26.250
Those new houses I was checking out
this afternoon were just full of 'em.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.753
Slime trails. Oh, I saw the biggest slug
in the world before you got home.

26:29.888 --> 26:33.222
Jesus Christ! Those things are big!

26:33.350 --> 26:36.309
- I told you they were big.
- Big? They're gigantic.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.188
Ah! Damn thing bit me!

26:44.319 --> 26:45.935
What kind of a slug bites someone?

26:46.071 --> 26:48.233
I don't know,
but he's living in your garden.

26:48.365 --> 26:50.948
Go get something with a lid on it.
Hurry up! Quick!

27:04.673 --> 27:06.915
Think your English friend
is still in his lab?

27:07.050 --> 27:08.666
- Yeah...
- All right, I'm going.

27:08.802 --> 27:10.589
No, wait!

27:23.567 --> 27:24.978
Oh, shoot!

28:03.732 --> 28:06.190
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

28:11.698 --> 28:13.280
What's for dinner?

28:13.408 --> 28:17.152
I thought we'd eat light tonight.
Just a big healthy salad.

28:17.287 --> 28:19.825
I was kind of looking forward to a steak.

28:19.957 --> 28:23.166
Hmm... We've been eating
too much red meat lately.

28:24.127 --> 28:25.618
I've got to keep up my strength.

28:26.546 --> 28:27.912
Before you go any further,

28:28.048 --> 28:31.883
you better decide if you want your dessert
before or after the main course.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.048
I was kind of hoping
for some wild hors d'oeuvres.

28:48.568 --> 28:50.434
- Got your keys, right?
- Yeah.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.311
OK. Good. Let's go. Come on.

29:06.128 --> 29:09.292
- John...
- Kim, Mike.

29:09.423 --> 29:10.959
What are you two doing here, eh?

29:11.091 --> 29:13.424
We're sorry to bother you, John,
but, um...

29:14.386 --> 29:16.969
John, I wanna ask you
some questions about these.

29:18.807 --> 29:20.139
What's this?

29:22.311 --> 29:23.973
What is that stuff, anyway?

29:24.104 --> 29:26.721
It's like mucus, you see.

29:26.857 --> 29:30.601
Only the slugs use it as an irritant
for its natural predators.

29:30.736 --> 29:34.104
It is also the way the buggers
get around. They travel on it.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.652
It's like a... like a slimy carpet.

29:36.783 --> 29:40.197
I read somewhere that
you can actually put a snail or slug

29:40.329 --> 29:42.366
on the edge of a razor blade,

29:42.497 --> 29:46.411
and it can crawl right across it
without ever touching the metal.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.920
- Fascinating, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's terrific. How does it eat?

29:51.048 --> 29:55.713
It has three or four rows of teeth
that it uses to grind up its food.

29:55.844 --> 29:58.882
- Which is?
- Greens mainly.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.097
Lettuce, cabbage. Things like that.

30:01.224 --> 30:04.808
Anything that grows in the garden
is a feast for them.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.264
- That's why gardeners hate them so much.
- John, do these things ever eat meat?

30:10.400 --> 30:14.770
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know, like, meat, animals?

30:15.906 --> 30:18.489
But they're usually only
as big as your thumb, Mike.

30:20.827 --> 30:26.164
However, there are some species,
which do eat tiny worms and insects.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.291
Why do you ask?

30:30.670 --> 30:34.129
John, let's say
I'll call you in the morning, OK?

30:34.257 --> 30:36.795
- All right. Make it after lunch, OK?
- Thanks.

30:37.719 --> 30:39.210
Mmm-hmm.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.770
It's getting late.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.572
What is it? What's wrong?

31:05.422 --> 31:07.426
Just a cramp.

31:07.749 --> 31:09.581
It's gone.

31:09.709 --> 31:14.329
Um, David, I'm sorry for being a bitch
so much of the time.

31:14.464 --> 31:16.296
You're not a bitch.

31:17.134 --> 31:19.171
I think the real problem is...

31:19.928 --> 31:22.295
My drinking. I know.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.677
It's getting the upper hand on me.

31:26.476 --> 31:28.843
Maybe I should see someone about it.

31:29.646 --> 31:31.603
You mean it?

31:31.731 --> 31:34.974
- I can't risk losing you.
- Mmm.

31:36.310 --> 31:38.193
David, what is it?

31:38.280 --> 31:39.612
Another cramp.

31:39.739 --> 31:42.698
- I'm calling the doctor.
- No!

31:44.327 --> 31:47.820
I'm all right. Really. It's past.

31:47.956 --> 31:52.326
Oh... But I've got this strange taste
in my mouth.

31:52.461 --> 31:55.169
Maybe it was the anchovies
that I put in the salad.

31:55.297 --> 31:58.335
Maybe. The salad did taste a little salty.

31:58.467 --> 32:00.254
I'm sorry.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.377
Not your fault. Usually I love 'em.

32:03.930 --> 32:06.513
Why don't you just go on upstairs,
and get into bed?

32:07.559 --> 32:11.098
Soon. I've got to go over these papers
one last time.

32:12.105 --> 32:14.597
I meet with the people
from Calgore tomorrow.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.568
If all goes well, we'll clinch
the shopping deal over lunch.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.146
Knowing you, it'll go terrific.

32:21.281 --> 32:25.241
Hmm. Give me 20 minutes, and I'll be up.

32:26.286 --> 32:28.869
You got a deal. I'll go take my bath.

32:58.151 --> 33:00.985
Come on. Move it, you old farts.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.035
I didn't think your folks
were ever gonna leave.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.973
- Oh, God, you're good.
- Jesus!

34:13.101 --> 34:14.933
What a stash!

34:16.271 --> 34:19.935
Captain Jack. Hello, Captain.

34:27.489 --> 34:30.107
- Do you want some?
- No, I don't.

34:30.243 --> 34:33.327
- Bobby, don't drink.
- Relax! I just want a little bit.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.291
I wonder what your old man
would say if he knew about us.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.083
Oh, he'd probably have a cow.

34:44.215 --> 34:46.581
Yeah, with pink spots.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.458
Are you sure you don't want one?

34:49.471 --> 34:53.556
Oh, Bobby... you know what I want.

36:51.217 --> 36:53.550
Oh, Bobby! Don't stop!

36:54.845 --> 36:56.457
Don't stop!

37:14.407 --> 37:16.569
Oh, Bobby, what's wrong?

37:16.701 --> 37:19.318
Nothing. I just have
to recharge my batteries.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.037
What are you doing?

37:22.165 --> 37:25.374
Nothing, goddamnit!
I just said I need a fucking rest!

37:25.502 --> 37:28.495
Fuck! Something bit me!

37:40.600 --> 37:41.932
Donna!

37:42.060 --> 37:43.141
Fuck!

37:50.373 --> 37:52.268
Donna!

37:53.488 --> 37:56.447
Donna! Fuck!

37:56.574 --> 37:58.833
Donna!

38:00.537 --> 38:02.904
No!

38:05.110 --> 38:07.912
- Bobby!
- Fuck!

38:11.089 --> 38:12.546
Bobby!

38:14.467 --> 38:16.049
Bobby!

38:16.177 --> 38:19.136
No, no, no!

38:19.764 --> 38:22.848
Bobby! Bobby!

38:27.210 --> 38:28.854
Bobby!

39:26.122 --> 39:29.866
Mike, someone on the phone
from the office. How'd that work?

39:30.877 --> 39:32.368
They think this stuff is candy.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.787
Why don't you try salt?

39:34.923 --> 39:39.293
Hey, no, really, that's a good idea.
I'm serious. Good.

39:39.427 --> 39:41.009
Oh, come on!

40:28.393 --> 40:30.100
Hey, what's up? The Sheriff inside?

40:30.228 --> 40:32.185
Yes, he's upstairs.

40:45.118 --> 40:47.826
- Pictures of everything. Understand?
- Sure, Sheriff.

40:47.954 --> 40:50.617
Don't "sure, Sheriff" me,
unless you know you're sure.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.785
I'm sure that I'm sure, Sheriff.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.830
You better be, Dobbs,
or I'll shove my boot so far up your butt,

40:55.962 --> 40:58.454
you'll need a tow truck to get it out.

40:58.589 --> 41:01.832
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Who let you in here?

41:01.968 --> 41:04.335
Oh, it's nice to see you too!

41:04.470 --> 41:07.053
You ain't allowed here. What do you want?

41:07.181 --> 41:12.393
Look, Sheriff, I know it sounds
crazier than hell, but I got this theory.

41:12.520 --> 41:16.730
Now, maybe, just maybe we're dealing
with a... a mutant form of slug here.

41:16.858 --> 41:18.190
A kind that eats meat.

41:18.317 --> 41:22.186
Huh! That don't sound crazy, Brady,
that is crazy!

41:23.239 --> 41:25.276
Killer slugs? For Christ's sakes!

41:25.408 --> 41:28.867
What'll it be next? Demented crickets?
Rampaging mosquitos maybe?

41:28.995 --> 41:30.577
All right, all right, all right!

41:30.705 --> 41:34.289
So, you explain the... the slimy shit
on the floor and the dead bodies.

41:34.834 --> 41:37.622
I will, I will. And let me just do my job,
and get out of here.

41:37.754 --> 41:39.416
Yeah, do that.

41:42.717 --> 41:47.087
What are you staring at, goddamnit? You
got nothing better to do than stare at me?

41:57.023 --> 41:58.855
Hi, Julie. Any messages for me?

41:58.983 --> 42:02.317
Don Palmer over at Sanitation
called twice. Says it's very important.

42:02.445 --> 42:04.903
OK. Did a guy named John Foley call?

42:05.031 --> 42:06.363
No, sir.

42:06.491 --> 42:09.359
All right, would you get Palmer
on the phone for me, please?

42:10.745 --> 42:12.077
- Julie?
- Yeah?

42:12.205 --> 42:14.618
Hi! Would you get Palmer
on the phone for me?

42:14.749 --> 42:17.241
Sure. Right away.
You don't have to bite my head off.

42:17.376 --> 42:18.912
I don't bite your head off.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.956
'Yeah, Mike Brady.'

42:24.092 --> 42:26.675
I got some stuff
that you're gonna be interested in.

42:26.803 --> 42:28.965
- What kind of things?
- 'Not over the phone.'

42:29.097 --> 42:30.338
How soon can you get here?

42:30.473 --> 42:34.137
- Jesus, Don! We're not the CIA!
- Half an hour?

42:34.727 --> 42:36.389
- Don, look, I'm...
- 'Mike...'

42:37.021 --> 42:40.185
Listen, my people
have been down in the sewers,

42:40.316 --> 42:46.153
and they have found half-eaten rats and
chickens and cats and even a large dog.

42:47.448 --> 42:48.984
OK, Don, I'm on my way.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.119
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah, a little.

42:55.164 --> 42:57.076
Maybe you should postpone your meeting.

42:57.208 --> 43:01.498
No can do. The clients are coming up
here just for this meeting.

43:01.629 --> 43:04.417
They'll have to sign today.
They're leaving after lunch.

43:05.174 --> 43:08.713
This is the entire sewer map
of the Ashton area.

43:08.845 --> 43:12.009
Now, this gigantic reservoir
takes all the waste from this area

43:12.140 --> 43:13.551
down to Baker's Corner.

43:13.683 --> 43:17.393
Right here is where the Sanitation
Department has its waste disposal plant.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.852
Yeah.

43:18.980 --> 43:21.768
My men were finding
dead animal remains here,

43:21.899 --> 43:23.765
but we've been finding them here too.

43:23.901 --> 43:26.314
Don, I still don't know
what you're driving at.

43:28.489 --> 43:32.859
First it was Ron Bell.
Then it was Talbot and the Moss girl.

43:32.994 --> 43:35.486
- The Moss' house is right here.
- Yeah.

43:36.497 --> 43:38.409
Something's down there killing people.

43:40.484 --> 43:43.022
And there's more you got to know.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.169
Yeah, like what?

43:46.382 --> 43:50.547
When I was researching these maps,
I discovered that in the '50s and '60s

43:50.678 --> 43:54.171
that this entire area,
from the edge of Ron Bell's property line

43:54.307 --> 43:56.970
to the town limits,
was a toxic waste dump.

43:58.269 --> 44:02.104
Every plastic and chemical plant
in the area dumped into it.

44:02.231 --> 44:04.188
Then about 20 years ago they filled it in.

44:04.859 --> 44:08.193
You know, Don Palmer,
you're a fountain of good news.

44:20.541 --> 44:22.248
I'll take mine rare.

44:22.376 --> 44:25.289
- Here you are.
- Sir, would you like an hors d'oeuvre?

44:25.421 --> 44:27.333
- Thank you.
- No, I'm not very hungry.

44:27.465 --> 44:29.206
- Whiskey?
- That's mine. Thank you.

44:29.342 --> 44:30.708
Thank you.

44:32.136 --> 44:35.595
- Anything wrong, Dave?
- No, no. I'm fine.

44:36.182 --> 44:39.300
I just have a blasted headache
that won't go away. Phew.

44:40.186 --> 44:42.473
Maybe we should postpone
until you're better.

44:42.605 --> 44:43.937
Not a chance.

44:44.065 --> 44:47.558
You're not getting out of town
until we've all signed on the dotted line.

44:50.112 --> 44:51.819
Cheers, Dave.

45:00.748 --> 45:02.956
I'll be back in a minute.

45:45.876 --> 45:50.246
- Feel better?
- Yeah, the aspirins are finally working.

45:50.381 --> 45:52.919
- Good, good. Drink up, then.
- Excuse me.

45:53.050 --> 45:56.464
Mmm. Shall we tell him now,
or wait until the cheque comes?

45:56.595 --> 45:58.257
There we are.

45:58.389 --> 45:59.971
Might as well tell him now.

46:00.099 --> 46:04.139
Who knows? It just might clear up
his headache once and for all.

46:04.270 --> 46:05.602
And yours.

46:05.730 --> 46:08.973
We've decided to go full steam ahead
with the project.

46:09.108 --> 46:13.273
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's terrific! Great!

46:13.404 --> 46:15.441
You know you'll never regret it.

46:16.949 --> 46:18.736
I'd like to propose a toast.

46:19.785 --> 46:24.029
Uh, to the beginning
of all the great things yet to come.

46:24.165 --> 46:25.997
Cheers.

46:32.230 --> 46:34.437
Oh, my God!

46:45.144 --> 46:46.476
Oh, my God!

46:54.403 --> 46:56.816
This is it.
This is where they've filled it in.

46:56.947 --> 47:00.190
It's the exact centre of where
they plan to put that shopping centre.

47:00.326 --> 47:01.658
Oh, my God.

47:01.786 --> 47:04.278
See where it is in relationship
to Ron Bell's house?

47:04.413 --> 47:06.029
Yeah, so?

47:06.165 --> 47:10.785
There's a possibility that the bulldozer
broke through the landfill.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.207
Who knows what poisonous gases escaped?

47:13.339 --> 47:15.797
Jesus, Don, you could be right.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.588
Yeah, Sanitation Department.

47:22.723 --> 47:24.885
Um, excuse me. Just a minute, please.

47:25.017 --> 47:27.179
It's for you. It's your office.

47:28.521 --> 47:29.932
Yes, Julie, it's Mike.

47:30.064 --> 47:31.430
'Your wife called.'

47:31.565 --> 47:35.980
Oh, and Sheriff Reese called. He said
to get over to Trombino's right away.

47:50.793 --> 47:53.206
Mr Brady,
the Sheriff's waiting for you inside.

47:53.337 --> 47:55.294
Uh, I'll check with the guys in white.

47:56.632 --> 47:58.749
You crazy? We got no worms here.

47:58.884 --> 48:01.467
- We got worms here?
- Worms?

48:03.347 --> 48:05.890
His mum has more worms...

48:06.725 --> 48:09.138
- What's he saying?
- He says we got no worms here.

48:09.270 --> 48:11.382
He wants worms...

48:13.441 --> 48:16.650
I give him... right up in his...

48:16.777 --> 48:18.393
Relax, relax.

48:18.529 --> 48:23.590
The worms that killed that boy didn't just
roller-skate here and jump on his plate.

48:27.955 --> 48:29.787
About time. I'm doing your job for you.

48:29.915 --> 48:31.998
This is a matter
for the Health Department.

48:32.126 --> 48:35.290
We found these on the plate.
My guess is they came from the food.

48:35.421 --> 48:37.959
I got no worms in my food.
I got no worms here!

48:38.090 --> 48:39.956
Sure, sure. Well?

48:40.092 --> 48:42.254
Well, what? Who died?

48:42.386 --> 48:44.844
I thought you knew.
A friend of yours. Dave Watson.

48:44.972 --> 48:47.464
- What?
- Well, do I close this place, or what?

48:47.600 --> 48:50.764
- I don't know that yet.
- Tell me if they came from the food.

48:50.895 --> 48:54.514
How should I know?
Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

48:54.648 --> 48:57.686
Why don't you just give me five minutes,
and I'll figure it out?

48:57.818 --> 48:59.730
Terrific! That's wonderful!

49:07.244 --> 49:08.780
Mike, what did you find in there?

49:08.913 --> 49:11.405
I don't know.
Maybe some kind of food poisoning.

49:11.540 --> 49:14.954
Food poisoning?
Mike, I was in there. I saw that guy.

49:15.085 --> 49:17.919
His face was eaten away.
His eyes were popping out.

49:18.047 --> 49:20.004
- I'm not an expert...
- That's right.

49:20.633 --> 49:23.946
We'll take it over to Foley,
and see what he has to say about it.

49:26.805 --> 49:28.387
Good God.

49:31.101 --> 49:32.467
Where'd you get these?

49:33.229 --> 49:36.497
Come on, John.
You wanna tell me what's going on?

49:40.569 --> 49:43.528
"The schistosomes are blood flukes,

49:43.656 --> 49:46.820
"a particularly virulent
strain of parasite

49:46.951 --> 49:50.740
"found in the blood streams
of... of slugs."

49:51.705 --> 49:53.822
Now tell me where you got them.

49:55.417 --> 49:59.286
Well, they came
from... Dave Watson's head.

50:00.756 --> 50:02.338
Oh, God.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.041
There's no end to his thing.

50:05.678 --> 50:06.885
What do you mean?

50:07.012 --> 50:09.800
First, they are carnivorous.
No doubt about that.

50:10.474 --> 50:13.308
Their slime produces an irritant,

50:13.435 --> 50:17.770
that given in large enough doses, kills.

50:17.898 --> 50:20.481
After paralysing. And now this...

50:20.609 --> 50:26.355
Parasites natural to them can be
transmitted and are lethal to humans.

50:26.490 --> 50:28.527
On top of that, slugs are hermaphrodites.

50:28.659 --> 50:29.991
Hermaphro-what?

50:30.119 --> 50:35.114
Hermaphroditic. Which means
they can fertilise their own eggs.

50:35.249 --> 50:37.332
Speaking of which, where do they breed?

50:38.252 --> 50:44.214
Well, anywhere it is dark and moist.
They're primarily night creatures.

50:45.050 --> 50:46.382
How about a sewer?

50:47.011 --> 50:49.219
Well... Well, as a breeding ground...

50:49.847 --> 50:52.385
Yes, it would be perfect.

51:32.890 --> 51:35.598
- Thank God! I've been trying to find you!
- What's wrong?

51:35.726 --> 51:39.640
Call Mrs Brady. She's called three times.
She's scared to death.

51:41.315 --> 51:43.147
Hello?

51:43.275 --> 51:45.813
Oh, Michael, where have you been?

51:45.944 --> 51:49.813
- What's wrong?
- Please come home. Hurry.

52:20.312 --> 52:23.771
Kim? What is it?

52:24.400 --> 52:26.107
What is it?

52:28.570 --> 52:30.152
Be careful!

52:33.075 --> 52:35.408
- What is it? What are you talking about?
- There.

52:35.536 --> 52:37.493
Oh, my God.

52:39.832 --> 52:41.198
Be careful.

52:52.803 --> 52:55.170
- Michael, who are you calling?
- Sheriff Reese.

52:55.305 --> 52:56.887
He damn well better talk to me now.

52:57.015 --> 52:59.473
Dobbs, it's Mike.
Put Sherriff Reese on the phone.

52:59.601 --> 53:03.720
He ain't here. He's out at Ashton Farms.
We got us another dead body over there.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.306
- You what?
- 'Amazing, ain't it?'

53:06.442 --> 53:09.935
The most exciting thing we had
around here was a Saturday-night drunk

53:10.070 --> 53:12.357
getting naked
and running down main street.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.072
Now we got a new dead body
showing up every ten minutes.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.816
Look, now, listen to me, Dobbs.

53:16.952 --> 53:18.363
You tell that fast bastard

53:18.495 --> 53:21.408
to get his ass over
to Frank Phillips' office immediately.

53:21.540 --> 53:22.872
You got that?

53:24.334 --> 53:27.668
Look, I have to go now.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

53:27.796 --> 53:30.004
Michael, I think I'm losing my mind.

53:30.132 --> 53:32.966
Just hang in there. You'll be fine.

53:33.093 --> 53:34.925
How? How am I gonna do that?

53:43.437 --> 53:46.396
Tell Mr Phillips that
Mike Brady is here to see him.

53:46.523 --> 53:49.061
- Hey, his office is closed.
- Yeah, watch me.

53:49.193 --> 53:50.559
You can't go in there.

53:54.531 --> 53:57.820
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We have an emergency on our hands.

53:57.951 --> 53:59.783
Should I call the police, Mr Phillips?

53:59.912 --> 54:03.622
That won't be necessary, Miss Wiley.
Thank you. What is this, Brady?

54:03.749 --> 54:07.459
I want you to cut off the water in the
south-end section of town immediately.

54:07.586 --> 54:09.794
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?

54:09.922 --> 54:11.709
No, it's not my idea of a joke.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.708
Now, the water in that section of town
has been contaminated

54:14.843 --> 54:16.425
by a mutated form of slug.

54:16.553 --> 54:18.795
If we don't shut the system down,
and I mean now,

54:18.931 --> 54:21.844
we risk contaminating the entire city.

54:21.975 --> 54:25.844
Hold on. Mutated slugs?
Contaminated water system?

54:25.979 --> 54:27.686
What the hell are you talking about?

54:27.815 --> 54:31.729
Phillips, listen to me.
We're facing a disaster here.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.764
You need a long vacation, pal.

54:35.322 --> 54:37.154
This is no time to argue.

54:37.282 --> 54:39.945
Who's arguing?
I'm telling you you're nuts.

54:40.077 --> 54:44.071
We'll declare a health emergency.
I'll take full responsibility.

54:44.206 --> 54:48.576
You ain't got the authority to declare
"happy birthday"! Not in this town!

54:48.710 --> 54:52.078
Oh, you crazy son of a bitch!
What's it gonna take?

54:52.214 --> 54:54.581
For starters, a request from the mayor.

54:54.716 --> 54:56.332
Then my concurrence!

54:56.468 --> 54:58.050
Now, get your ass out of here!

55:16.530 --> 55:18.271
Mutated slugs...

55:19.616 --> 55:21.323
Crazy asshole.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.698
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

55:26.039 --> 55:27.951
Then can I go to lunch?

55:28.083 --> 55:29.415
OK, go.

55:41.305 --> 55:46.642
Everything Mr Watson promised
Calgore Corporated will remain.

55:46.768 --> 55:49.977
That's the way Mr Watson did his business,
and the kind of man he was.

55:50.105 --> 55:52.438
He'll be greatly missed.

55:52.566 --> 55:55.900
God, you never saw anything
like what happened in that restaurant.

55:56.028 --> 55:59.942
- Oh, put it out of your mind, Sue.
- How? His whole face was...

56:00.574 --> 56:02.315
Uh, can I freshen your drinks?

56:20.344 --> 56:23.212
I sure hope things like that
don't happen around here again.

56:23.347 --> 56:28.513
Huh, what?
Uh, M-Miss Channing, I assure you...

56:28.644 --> 56:32.137
- Forget it.
- Sue, I think it's time we got going.

56:32.272 --> 56:36.061
Well, of course. I only thought you people
were prepared to sign the papers.

56:36.193 --> 56:39.561
Why not? We might as well... do it.

56:42.908 --> 56:44.740
- Yes?
- Sorry, Mr Mayor.

56:44.868 --> 56:48.737
Mike Brady of the Health Department
is here. He says it's an emergency.

56:48.872 --> 56:52.331
Tell him it'll have to wait. I'm in
the middle of an important conver...

56:52.459 --> 56:56.043
Sorry, Mr Mayor,
but what I have to say can't wait.

56:56.171 --> 56:58.254
We have a potential disaster on our hands.

56:59.549 --> 57:00.915
Potential disaster?

57:03.512 --> 57:06.755
Uh, excuse me. I won't be a minute.

57:13.271 --> 57:16.059
Who the hell do you think you are
to burst in here like this?

57:16.191 --> 57:20.936
Look, you've got to call Frank Phillips.
Tell him to shut down the water system.

57:21.071 --> 57:23.779
- What?
- We have slugs in our water.

57:24.282 --> 57:27.491
We've got to contain them to the sewers,
or we don't stand a chance.

57:28.537 --> 57:31.280
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

57:31.415 --> 57:34.249
but you're gonna have
to listen to me and trust me.

57:34.835 --> 57:39.250
What happened to Ron Bell, Donna
Moss and Dave Watson are all related,

57:39.381 --> 57:40.792
and it's only the beginning.

57:40.924 --> 57:44.634
Sure, Mr Brady, sure. Anything you say.

57:44.761 --> 57:47.845
Look, goddamnit, don't patronise me.
I'm not insane.

57:47.973 --> 57:50.807
Insane? I never said that you were!

57:50.934 --> 57:53.096
Look, put down the phone.

57:54.271 --> 57:55.978
Are you gonna start listening to me?

57:56.106 --> 57:58.894
Sorry to interrupt,
but we have a plane to catch.

57:59.818 --> 58:02.151
- Are you from Calgore?
- Yes, I am.

58:05.073 --> 58:06.905
Get Sheriff Reese. I want him here now.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.699
My name is Mike Brady,
and I am the county health inspector,

58:11.830 --> 58:13.662
and like I was trying to tell the mayor,

58:13.790 --> 58:16.749
we have a very serious situation
on our hands here.

58:16.877 --> 58:18.914
Situation? What kind of situation?

58:19.046 --> 58:22.164
This entire area used to be
a toxic waste dump,

58:22.299 --> 58:23.631
and not only that,

58:23.759 --> 58:26.672
we have a mutant form of killer slug
in our water system.

58:26.803 --> 58:28.510
- A toxic waste dump?
- Yes.

58:28.638 --> 58:32.598
That's bullshit! This man's nuts.
God knows what his game is.

58:32.726 --> 58:36.310
My game is, like what you would call it,
is to save lives.

58:36.438 --> 58:38.976
You mean to tell me
if I turn on the water tap,

58:39.107 --> 58:41.940
a killer slug is gonna
come out and get me?

58:43.570 --> 58:45.857
Well... let's just see.

58:53.663 --> 58:55.905
We have nothing to hide in this town.

59:06.968 --> 59:09.051
Shall we finish signing the papers?

59:09.179 --> 59:10.761
Absolutely.

59:16.561 --> 59:18.928
Well, there's no time like the present.

59:19.064 --> 59:22.307
- Sure. Let's get it done with.
- OK.

59:22.442 --> 59:24.479
You're not gonna sign this thing, are you?

59:24.611 --> 59:29.231
Huh, now then, Mr Brady,
if you don't mind,

59:29.366 --> 59:31.904
let us get on with our business.

59:33.245 --> 59:35.407
You people are unbelievable.

59:44.089 --> 59:45.705
Thank you.

01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:10.734
Mr Phillips? I'm back.

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:21.782
Mr Phillips?

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.209
Are you OK there?

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.542
Mr Phillips?

01:00:45.192 --> 01:00:47.559
Now, watch this.

01:00:51.656 --> 01:00:54.444
- Well, what do you think?
- It's fantastic, Foley.

01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:58.445
- What is that stuff?
- It's a lithium-based arsenic.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.620
Lithium is highly combustible
when it comes into contact with moisture.

01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:05.869
Yeah, but can you make enough of that
to kill thousands of slugs?

01:01:06.004 --> 01:01:08.212
Well, making the stuff's no problem,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.333
but to get all of them in one place
at the same time,

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:12.879
that's quite something else.

01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:16.800
Well, I'm convinced that
their main nest is in the sewers

01:01:16.932 --> 01:01:18.764
near Ron Bell's old house.

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:23.387
Now, the problem is, can we use this
without blowing up the whole town?

01:01:23.521 --> 01:01:25.478
Well, I hope so.

01:01:25.607 --> 01:01:28.099
You know something?
I think it's worth a try.

01:01:28.235 --> 01:01:32.445
What do you say we meet at
the Sanitation Department in three hours?

01:01:33.073 --> 01:01:35.235
It's going to take me some time.

01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:37.734
John, just be there.

01:01:41.122 --> 01:01:42.863
All right. I'll be there.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:56.820
Ready... set... huh!

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.222
Come on, Dad!

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.937
- Mike, what's up?
- Uh, let's go inside, and I'll tell you.

01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:12.776
Guys, we're gonna have to hang it up.

01:02:12.904 --> 01:02:14.691
- We got to go anyway.
- Go where?

01:02:14.823 --> 01:02:17.065
- To a Halloween party.
- What Halloween party?

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.692
- Some guys are getting together.
- Just make sure...

01:02:19.828 --> 01:02:21.740
To be home early.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.078
- What's up?
- Uh, it's not great news.

01:02:29.129 --> 01:02:30.586
Don?

01:02:36.136 --> 01:02:39.550
- Oh, hi, Maria. Mike just stopped by.
- Hi, Maria.

01:02:39.681 --> 01:02:42.970
- Hi, Mike. Happy Halloween.
- Same to you.

01:02:43.101 --> 01:02:44.308
Want some coffee?

01:02:44.436 --> 01:02:47.645
Uh, no. No thanks.
We're gonna be in the den.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:54.352
- So, what's up?
- Well, Don, I...

01:02:55.822 --> 01:02:57.734
- I need your help.
- Sure.

01:02:57.866 --> 01:03:00.404
I'm going down to the sewers
after the slugs.

01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:01.867
Oh...

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:06.160
Yeah, I spoke to this guy, Foley,
and he found stuff that'll kill them.

01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:07.623
What kind of stuff?

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:11.085
It's a chemical.
It'll... make them explode.

01:03:11.838 --> 01:03:13.295
- Explode?
- Yeah.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:15.540
It reacts to the moisture in their bodies.

01:03:17.385 --> 01:03:19.126
Let me get this straight.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.219
You wanna take something that explodes,

01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:24.591
when it comes in contact with water,
down into the sewer?

01:03:24.726 --> 01:03:26.467
- Mmm-hmm.
- You're crazy.

01:03:27.312 --> 01:03:29.599
Don, we have no alternative.

01:03:29.731 --> 01:03:32.439
I've been to the mayor,
and I've been to the Sheriff,

01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:34.308
and nobody wants to listen.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:37.903
Now, these things are coming out
of the water taps in my neighbourhood.

01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:42.116
Right. You imagine
if they spread to the entire system.

01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:46.949
Let's get started, partner.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.290
You don't want any more time
to think about this?

01:03:51.169 --> 01:03:53.126
I don't need to think about it.

01:03:53.254 --> 01:03:55.462
I've got a wife and two kids too.

01:03:56.257 --> 01:03:59.625
And I don't want what happened
to Watson happening to one of them.

01:04:00.512 --> 01:04:01.969
Good.

01:04:17.195 --> 01:04:20.404
Um... I'm... I'm gonna go out for a while.

01:04:21.032 --> 01:04:23.445
- You'll be long?
- No, I don't think so.

01:04:23.576 --> 01:04:24.817
Where are you going?

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:27.611
To tell you the God's honest truth,

01:04:27.747 --> 01:04:30.740
Brady and I are gonna go
and kill some man-eating slugs.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:36.337
Oh, I trust these so-called
killer slugs of yours

01:04:36.464 --> 01:04:39.457
aren't 18 years old and speak French?

01:04:41.592 --> 01:04:43.485
No!

01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:48.098
But I'll tell you what...
when I do get back,

01:04:48.226 --> 01:04:51.469
how about if we get naked and get crazy?

01:04:51.604 --> 01:04:54.312
Hmm. I'll be here.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:02.525
Kim?

01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:09.953
Kim?

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.456
Kim, are you here?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.011
Kim?

01:05:45.283 --> 01:05:46.899
Kim?

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.623
- Mike? Where are you?
- Kim, is that you?

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.804
- Kim! Oh, God! Am I glad to see you!
- You too, honey.

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:11.174
- Where were you?
- I was at Maureen's.

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:14.222
Oh, Michael, she's in terrible shape.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06:14.354 --> 01:06:17.518
I didn't wanna scare you.
Now, I want you to go to your mother's.

01:06:17.649 --> 01:06:20.858
- Wait for me there. I'll be there soon.
- I want you to go now!

01:06:20.985 --> 01:06:23.523
Kim, this thing's turned
into a total disaster.

01:06:23.655 --> 01:06:25.988
Do as I say. Go to your mother's.

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:28.198
I don't want to be without you.
Understand?

01:06:28.326 --> 01:06:31.319
Yes, I understand.

01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:35.031
See? They're all over the place.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:37.078
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:42.126
OK, now everything's gonna be OK.
Just get your things. Let's go.

01:07:43.943 --> 01:07:46.026
I still can't believe Bobby's dead.

01:07:46.154 --> 01:07:49.113
- Don't think about it.
- It was that goddamn goat killer.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.651
I'd like to get my hands on him.

01:07:50.783 --> 01:07:52.945
What are you gonna do? Bore him to death?

01:07:53.077 --> 01:07:56.070
OK, smartass, then you tell me
what happened to Bobby and Donna.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:08:00.495
- Keep quiet! I'm leaving.
- Don't worry. He's upset about Bobby.

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:20.261
- You ready?
- Depends on what you mean by "ready".

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.308
Well, we should have enough to do it.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.932
I hope so, 'cause we're only getting
one shot at this.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:26.479
Is this, uh, my little suit?

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:35.492
There are miles of sewers down there.
Those things could be anywhere.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.283
Right. That's why we're gonna get 'em
all in one place.

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:41.828
How are you gonna do that,
invite them over for a hamburger?

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:45.622
Something like that.
We're, uh, gonna give 'em a little bait.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.462
I hope you don't mean
what I think you mean.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.755
No. I got something better than that.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.993
I told you
I didn't want to come to this party.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:25.037
Come on. It's a Halloween party.
How can you not be having fun?

01:09:25.169 --> 01:09:27.582
I feel awkward.
I'm hardly dressed for this.

01:09:27.714 --> 01:09:30.421
- You look fine. Have a couple of beers.
- Have some pizza.

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:32.462
- I don't want any pizza!
- Try it!

01:09:32.593 --> 01:09:34.050
- Bug off!
- Could we go?

01:09:34.178 --> 01:09:36.170
Yeah. Punk!

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:14.250
- Stop it, Danny!
- I thought you liked me.

01:10:14.385 --> 01:10:15.796
Well, of course I like you.

01:10:15.928 --> 01:10:20.047
But liking you and letting you get into
my panties is a different kind of thing!

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:22.049
I wish you wouldn't put it that way.

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:24.393
How would you like me to put it?

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.221
That we have something special.

01:10:28.065 --> 01:10:29.852
You do like me, don't you?

01:10:29.984 --> 01:10:31.441
Well, not that much.

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.246
I said no!

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:51.461
What's the use?
All you wanna do is play mind games.

01:10:51.589 --> 01:10:54.423
- Well, count me out!
- Fine!

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.007
So what?

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.545
OK, guys, this is it.

01:11:00.181 --> 01:11:02.764
Now, we can go underground right here.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:05.555
And from everything I can put together,

01:11:05.686 --> 01:11:08.850
I have to guess that
their main body is right here.

01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:11.849
Now, there's a manhole cover
right above this chamber.

01:11:12.777 --> 01:11:15.770
OK, John, you position yourself
by the manhole.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.988
You get ready to drop your stuff.

01:11:18.115 --> 01:11:20.903
Any strays we see,
we push into that chamber.

01:11:21.035 --> 01:11:24.028
Now, when we're ready to get out,
we'll signal you.

01:11:24.163 --> 01:11:25.654
Mmm-hmm. Right.

01:11:32.046 --> 01:11:35.289
- We're all set. Just one more thing.
- What's that?

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:38.292
Once we're in the chamber,
you give us two minutes to get out.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:42.341
If we don't get out, you drop the stuff.
Understand?

01:11:42.473 --> 01:11:43.805
Yes.

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:58.126
It's this way.

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:15.931
- I can't wait.
- I know. It's gonna be so killer.

01:13:16.067 --> 01:13:17.558
- Want a beer?
- Nah.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.810
- Where's Pam?
- I told her to get lost.

01:13:19.946 --> 01:13:21.858
- You what?
- Yeah, she's a real bitch.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.198
You're an asshole. Right down to steerage.

01:13:26.118 --> 01:13:28.986
- Where are you going?
- None of your goddamn business.

01:13:30.622 --> 01:13:33.535
- I can't believe that.
- What's up with him?

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:50.807
Son of a bitch.

01:13:52.103 --> 01:13:55.062
They closed the entrance
without marking it on the map.

01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:56.896
What do we do now?

01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:06.114
There's another way in from section G13,

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.325
but it's a long way around.

01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:11.323
- No other way?
- There's no other way.

01:14:11.455 --> 01:14:13.663
Well, let's go then.

01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:43.981
Sure this is the way?

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:46.230
Yeah, the entrance is right up ahead.

01:14:47.366 --> 01:14:50.985
Pam! Pam!

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:54.784
Where are you, Pam?

01:14:58.461 --> 01:14:59.793
Pam!

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:03.963
Pam!

01:15:05.926 --> 01:15:09.260
Pam! Pam!

01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:27.483
We're taking a right just up ahead.

01:15:27.615 --> 01:15:29.902
Just watch yourself.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.864
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.333
Jeez, it's worse than I thought.

01:15:40.461 --> 01:15:44.796
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- No, no. I got an idea. Here. Hold this.

01:15:49.553 --> 01:15:51.135
Oh, shit.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.974
You're not gonna light that blowtorch.
You're crazy.

01:15:56.102 --> 01:15:58.219
These sewage gases could be explosive.

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:02.018
Don't worry.
This section has plenty of ventilation.

01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:04.562
I'm gonna electrocute the bastards.

01:16:18.666 --> 01:16:20.953
We're gonna get fried. Come on! Let's go!

01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:31.042
Come on!

01:16:33.347 --> 01:16:35.054
Watch out for that pipe.

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.866
- Goddamnit.
- What?

01:16:54.994 --> 01:16:58.704
This shouldn't even be here.
It isn't even on the map.

01:16:59.707 --> 01:17:03.792
Best I can figure were about
underneath that... that old factory.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.046
What are we gonna do?

01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:11.383
There's nothing else we can do.
We just have to go on.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.178
Let me call Foley,
and let him know we're on our way.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:17.843
Foley, this is Brady. Come in.

01:17:17.975 --> 01:17:22.720
Yeah, Mike. I'm here. I'm near
the rendezvous. Everything OK?

01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:25.518
We're just about
at the entrance of the old factory.

01:17:25.649 --> 01:17:29.142
- What?
- Meet us at the sewer entrance

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:31.190
at the old factory in just a few minutes.

01:17:31.322 --> 01:17:32.858
We'll be there as soon as we can.

01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:35.402
Right. I'm on my way.

01:17:35.534 --> 01:17:37.116
Over.

01:17:37.995 --> 01:17:41.864
- Are we out of here?
- Yeah. Let's go.

01:17:52.176 --> 01:17:54.463
There's a million of 'em down here.

01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:57.303
Come on, take out the torch,
and use it now.

01:17:57.431 --> 01:18:02.142
Can't. There's enough methane down here
to blow us all the way to Kentucky.

01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:05.353
Well, is there another way to go?

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.063
Not that I know about.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:12.023
Oh, man.
It's getting real tight down there.

01:18:25.084 --> 01:18:26.700
How much farther?

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.337
Not far.

01:18:34.218 --> 01:18:37.086
What is it? What's wrong, Palmer?

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.020
- They're right up ahead.
- Come on now, Palmer. Move it.

01:18:47.147 --> 01:18:50.561
- Maybe you didn't hear what I said.
- I hear you. I said move!

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:53.859
Come on, Palmer! Go!

01:18:54.822 --> 01:18:56.779
Quick! Get out of here!

01:18:58.409 --> 01:19:01.902
Mike, do you read me?

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:04.996
I'm at the old factory now.

01:19:05.124 --> 01:19:06.956
I'll open the manhole.

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.621
Over and out.

01:19:31.775 --> 01:19:36.110
My God! This has got to be it!
We're right underneath that old factory.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:39.572
Foley... Foley, come in. This is Mike.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.569
We've found their main breeding ground.
Now, get all that stuff ready.

01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:45.696
We're gonna try to find a way out of here.

01:19:50.878 --> 01:19:55.293
Mike, come on! I've found a way!
Will you drop that stuff? Come on!

01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:05.348
Come on!

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:08.301
This is it.

01:20:09.313 --> 01:20:11.020
Yeah.

01:20:11.732 --> 01:20:13.598
But how are we gonna get over there?

01:20:14.234 --> 01:20:15.975
The sack.

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.945
You're right. The sack.
I'll go get the meat.

01:20:19.073 --> 01:20:20.564
I'll be right back.

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.422
This ought to distract them for a minute.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:44.467
Toss the whole thing in.

01:20:48.769 --> 01:20:50.351
Whoa!

01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:54.894
- Now what are we gonna do?
- We gotta go back that way.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.692
We can't go back. Look.

01:21:03.617 --> 01:21:05.074
Take this. I got an idea.

01:21:16.422 --> 01:21:18.880
Mike, get on the phone and call Foley.

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:21.215
Tell him to pour that stuff
down the manhole.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.551
- We'll get out this way.
- Foley...

01:21:25.806 --> 01:21:27.342
Foley, it's Brady. Come in.

01:21:56.128 --> 01:21:58.245
Don!

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.630
Don, give me your hand.
Don, do you hear me?

01:22:01.758 --> 01:22:04.842
Help me!

01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:07.713
Don, give me your hand!

01:22:09.433 --> 01:22:11.641
Don!

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:15.929
Don!

01:22:29.369 --> 01:22:32.032
Mike! Mike! Help me!

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:34.577
Come on!

01:22:36.043 --> 01:22:38.160
Mike, get out! Get out!

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.649
- Are you all right, Mike?
- Do it, Foley!

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:11.697
- But Palmer... Where is he?
- Do it!

01:23:14.581 --> 01:23:17.449
Go on! Pour it in!
Go on, Foley! Do it! Now!

01:24:35.746 --> 01:24:37.829
I'm sorry about your friend, Brady.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.617
You... You can go to hell.

01:24:43.962 --> 01:24:46.921
Mike... he knew the chances.

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:49.628
I could've kept him out of this.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.377
No, I don't think you could. He knew that.

01:24:54.097 --> 01:24:56.885
We could never have done it
without him, Mike.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:01.720
That's a small comfort now.

01:25:08.654 --> 01:25:10.486
- Mike!
- Kim!
