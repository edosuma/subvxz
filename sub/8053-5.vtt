00:02.268 --> 00:06.534
In a town as old as Pawnee,
there's a lot of history in every acre.

00:06.606 --> 00:11.305
This wooded area is the site of, um,
the murder, actually,

00:11.378 --> 00:13.369
of Nathaniel Bixby Mark.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.745
He was a pioneer who was killed
by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians,

00:16.816 --> 00:20.547
<i>after he traded them a baby</i>
<i>for what is now Indianapolis.</i>

00:20.787 --> 00:22.652
They cut his face off.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.084
And they made it
into a dream catcher.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.890
And they made his legs into rain sticks.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.453
And that's the great thing
about Indians, back then, is,

00:31.531 --> 00:33.590
they used every
part of the pioneer.

Today is a great day
for the Knope family.

00:57.490 --> 01:01.153
<i>My mother is being honored at a</i>
<i>banquet with the Tellenson Award</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:04.025
<i>for Excellence in</i>
<i>Pawnee Public Service.</i>

01:04.129 --> 01:08.499
The award's named after the legendary
Tony Tellenson, who was a great man.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.433
Sorry, is a great man.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.497
I, for one, am glad that
they're keeping him alive.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.974
I saw you survive
that town hall meeting.

01:17.043 --> 01:18.943
You keep that up and you're
gonna be figuring out

01:19.012 --> 01:21.105
what wall to put your
own Tellenson Award on.

01:21.181 --> 01:24.173
Oh, I already know, the one on the
left where the American flag is.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.343
But I think we could
be a multi-generational

01:26.419 --> 01:28.250
political dynasty,
you and I, you know?

01:28.321 --> 01:30.186
Like the Kennedys,
or the Bushes.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.383
Minus the drinking problem.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.890
I mean no disrespect.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.357
The only reason anybody's
going to this thing

01:37.430 --> 01:40.763
is because they're afraid of what
Marlene'll do to them if they don't.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.495
That woman is tough.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.094
In 1994, I gave
her a nickname.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.639
It's unrepeatable,
but it stuck.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.539
It's my proudest
accomplishment.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.873
It's "The Iron
(BLEEP) of Pawnee."

01:58.218 --> 01:59.685
LESLIE: This is very exciting.
This is a big night.

01:59.752 --> 02:03.449
We are gonna meet some powerful
people tonight, so take this down.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.547
TOM: Mmm-hmm.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.091
Good evening.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.360
Marlene Griggs-Knope
is my mother.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.596
How important
are speeches?

02:11.664 --> 02:13.928
I don't know, ask
the Gettysburg Address.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.331
Oh, it didn't
answer your call?

02:15.401 --> 02:18.063
Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.

02:18.404 --> 02:22.773
It was a great learning experience
because my mom casts a long shadow.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.002
Read that part
back to me.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.046
"I was learning-disabled and my
mom cast a very long shadow."

02:27.113 --> 02:29.047
No, I didn't say
"learning-disabled."

02:29.315 --> 02:32.182
Um, we'll just move on.
We can fix that later. Long shadow, go.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.719
Okay, I've lost
my momentum now.

02:33.786 --> 02:34.912
Um, all right,
let's start from the top.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.046
What's the first
sentence again?

02:36.122 --> 02:38.920
"Marlene Griggs-Knope
is morbidly obese."

02:40.527 --> 02:42.552
I never said "obese."
I said "is my mother."

02:42.629 --> 02:44.153
Oh, sorry.
I got it.

02:44.230 --> 02:47.393
I need to mention the park
and in a very subtle way,

02:47.467 --> 02:49.560
I need to let people know
that I'm forging my own path

02:49.636 --> 02:50.967
and I have my
own subcommittee.

02:51.037 --> 02:53.301
But I don't want to sound braggy.
What do I do?

02:53.373 --> 02:55.398
It's about appearing
humble, you know?

02:55.475 --> 02:57.170
Abraham Lincoln,
when he started his speeches,

02:57.243 --> 02:59.643
he would come up and say,
" My name's Abraham Lincoln.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.145
"I'm the President
of the United States.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.240
"But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I have no clue what I'm doing."

03:04.317 --> 03:05.614
So, maybe you start off
with something like that.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.277
Okay. So, I start off with,
"I am Leslie Knope.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.911
"I am the Deputy Director
of Parks and Recreation,

03:08.988 --> 03:11.013
"and to be honest with you,
I don't know what I'm doing."

03:11.090 --> 03:12.853
LESLIE: Yeah.
Yeah. Then,

03:12.926 --> 03:15.622
I think what we want to do at that
point is start getting the energy up.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.356
Yeah.
How about this?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.194
"Marlene Griggs-Knope
is definitely not a whore."

03:20.266 --> 03:21.893
No.
"Marlene Griggs-Knope

03:21.968 --> 03:24.630
"has not five but seven Asian friends.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.265
"Marlene Griggs-Knope has never
solicited a male prostitute.

03:28.341 --> 03:33.369
"Marlene Griggs-Knope has said the N-word
only four times in her entire life."

03:33.446 --> 03:35.277
No! No!

03:35.348 --> 03:36.610
She said it
more than that?

03:36.749 --> 03:37.841
(PLAYING GUITAR)

03:38.418 --> 03:39.407
(DOOR OPENS)

03:41.054 --> 03:42.453
How about this one?

03:43.690 --> 03:44.714
That is hot.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.758
Seriously?

03:45.825 --> 03:47.258
Yes. That is really hot.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.591
How come you don't dress
up like that for me?

03:49.662 --> 03:51.357
Well, 'cause I would
feel a little silly

03:51.431 --> 03:54.298
putting on a nice dress
to go to "the couch."

03:54.367 --> 03:55.925

03:58.571 --> 04:00.095
<i>ANN: I haven't been</i>
<i>out in so long.</i>

04:00.173 --> 04:03.836
Andy being in a cast has definitely
put a crimp in our social life.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.400
I don't really
know Leslie's mom,

04:05.478 --> 04:07.912
and I don't know what
the Tellenson Award is,

04:07.981 --> 04:10.711
but at this
moment in my life,

04:10.783 --> 04:13.115
it sounds like
a magical evening.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.983
Babe,
I'm out of milk.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.156
<i>ANN: How dressy</i>
<i>is this, exactly?</i>

04:20.226 --> 04:21.317

04:21.394 --> 04:24.124
It is the most exclusive local
government event of the year.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.131
<i>Really?</i>
Yeah.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.965

Next.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.482
(CHUCKLES) So,
what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.549
My feet hurt.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.392
(LAUGHS) Classic Salvatore!

04:58.464 --> 04:59.453
Do I know you?

04:59.532 --> 05:03.024
Uh, no. This is my first
official political haircut.

I'm Leslie Knope,
Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.366
Are you related to that
Marlene Something-Knope?

05:09.442 --> 05:13.469
That depends. Would you call
being her daughter related?

05:13.546 --> 05:15.514
What the hell else
would you call it?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.647
Now, what do you
want me to do with this?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.548
Well, my mom is
being honored tonight.

05:19.619 --> 05:22.087
So, in a way,
I am also being honored.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.350
And I just wanted to mix things
up a little bit, you know?

05:24.424 --> 05:29.384
Pin it up, something sassy,
but powerful and dynastic.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.803
Hi, April.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.838
Good evening, sir.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.306
I'm off the clock, April.
You don't need to call me sir.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.742
Salvatore calls this
hairdo "The Mayor."

05:45.812 --> 05:47.404
And yes, I will wear
my hair like this

05:47.480 --> 05:49.971
when I am the first
female mayor of Pawnee.

05:50.717 --> 05:54.244
Oh, man, I am
way overdressed.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.880
What are you talking about?
You look great. We look great.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.116
Everyone's
looking at us.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.749
Yeah, I know.

05:59.826 --> 06:03.193
You want a drink?
Yes, I do very much want a drink.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.923
ANN: That man
is staring.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.397
That's former City
Councilman Frank Schnable.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.459
Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann.
Rarified air!

06:10.536 --> 06:13.232
He's coming over. What?
Okay. Be cool, be cool!

06:13.306 --> 06:14.671
I will try.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.209
Hello.
Hello, former City Councilman.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.972
I am Leslie Knope. I am the daughter
of the honoree this evening.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.741
I just wanted to tell you that I think

06:21.814 --> 06:24.476
that what you two are doing is so brave.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.744
Just being
who you are.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.879
I wish I had
your courage.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.784
Okay, let's go.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.997
<i>RON: I enjoy</i>
<i>government functions</i>

06:42.068 --> 06:46.300
<i>like I enjoy getting kicked in</i>
<i>the nuggets with a steel-toe boot.</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:50.008
But this hotel always
serves bacon-wrapped shrimp.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.978
That's my number one favorite food wrapped
around my number three favorite food.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.742
I'd go to a banquet and honor
of those Somali pirates,

06:56.816 --> 06:59.751
if they served bacon-wrapped shrimp.
Excuse me.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.313
Hey, Table 12.
Can I get a "what what?"

07:02.388 --> 07:03.719
Wow.

07:03.790 --> 07:04.848
LESLIE: Thank you.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.588
I mean, Ann,
you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow.

07:09.662 --> 07:10.788
I was going for wow.

07:10.863 --> 07:11.921
TOM: You got it.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.590
I was told it
was black tie.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.361
I like your
hairdo, Leslie.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.424
Thank you, Ron.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.733
It's just like my brother's.
He's an officer in the Air Force.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.937
Bacon-wrapped shrimp.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.373
Oh. Thanks, I'm okay.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.501
I wasn't offering.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.807
(GASPS) Oh,
Ann, don't look.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.107
No, no, I said don't look.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.150
Seated behind us
is Janine Restrepo.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.980
LESLIE: We need to rezone the
pit to turn it into a park

07:33.052 --> 07:34.349
and she's on
the zoning board.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.116
Oh, what a night!
Please.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.316
This is so cool.

living Tellenson Award winners.

07:42.295 --> 07:46.061
Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg,
Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink,

07:46.132 --> 07:49.465
Michael Holloway, I don't know who
that is, that's somebody's wife,

07:49.535 --> 07:52.834
Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism
and Oscar Pfortmiller.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.532
Wait.
Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.165
That's his
disappointing son, Theo.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.733
Another dynasty.
What a testament to my mother.

07:58.811 --> 08:03.077
If a bomb went off in here, it would
definitely make the Indianapolis papers.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.515
Guys, we have to get me to
talk to Janine Restrepo.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.281
She's right behind us and
she could rezone our park.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.289
Well, then just go up there and
say hello and start talking to her.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.654
Brilliant political
strategy, Mark.

08:12.725 --> 08:13.714

08:13.826 --> 08:15.817
Maybe I should mention
her massive weight loss.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.487
You're over-thinking this.

08:17.563 --> 08:22.557
Here, I'm gonna pretend to be
Janine Restrepo. You, be you. Go.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.103

Member Janine Restrepo.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.867

08:27.940 --> 08:30.408
Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board
Member Janine Restrepo.

08:30.476 --> 08:31.670
And I can do
whatever I want.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.577
Please, tell me about this park
that you badly need rezoned by me.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.409
(MARK LAUGHS) Okay, well,
I think it would be a good idea

08:36.482 --> 08:38.847
to have a multi-use community park.
MARK: Oh. Do you?

08:38.918 --> 08:40.078
ANN: Oh!
MARK: Wait, what's that?

08:40.152 --> 08:43.383
What? I'm just former City
Councilman Frank Whatever-The-Hell.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.822
And I have more power than Janine
Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want.

08:45.892 --> 08:46.916
I don't even know if that's true or not.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.223
Oh, my God, really?
Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope

08:49.295 --> 08:51.058

destroy you all!

are you guys doing?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.832

be zoning board members.

My goodness.
Look at you.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.302
You like?
I went to Salvatore.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.075
(CHUCKLES) Salvatore
usually does men.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.172
Usually.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.183
But this time he made an exception.
Hmm.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.809
This is Ann Perkins.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.945
Oh, right,
Leslie's new friend.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.320
Yeah, friend. She's...
We're friends. Just friends.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.621
I have a boyfriend.
He's a man.

09:21.460 --> 09:25.453
So, I need your advice.
I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.431
The queen of
the zoning board?

09:28.367 --> 09:32.167
Am I the only (BLEEP) Person here
who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?

09:32.505 --> 09:35.338
I think she could be
very useful. What's my in?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.739
Oh, let's see.
You wrote a speech?

09:36.809 --> 09:40.370
Yes. It's 22 minutes
long, with the song.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.970
I could cut the song.
The song's cut.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.672
Scrap the whole thing.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.217
Let's make the
speech work for us.

09:46.285 --> 09:50.346
Oh, politics! Yes!
My mom is crazy good at this.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.288
Okay, the two things
you have going for you

09:52.358 --> 09:54.155
is your connection
with me, of course,

09:54.226 --> 09:56.717
and the fact that Restrepo
loves feeling important.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.821
So make sure that
you butter her up.

09:58.898 --> 09:59.956
I will.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.193
I'll make her feel
like a human dinner roll.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.931
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Leslie Knope,</i>
<i>Marlene's daughter.</i>

10:08.541 --> 10:13.274
<i>Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom,</i>

<i>She's also my mother.</i>
<i>And together, we are the Knopes.</i>

<i>And if you</i>

<i>Janine Restrepo,</i>

<i>And I am just so psyched</i>

Thanks, Tom.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.721
Hi, Ann. I wish I could talk.
Moving and shaking.

11:03.062 --> 11:06.725
This is my evening.
I'm Leslie's trophy wife.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.691
<i>I'd like to invite anyone who</i>

<i>Hello, Pawnee government!</i>
<i>My name is Tom Haverford.</i>

11:27.153 --> 11:28.848
Janine? Hi.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.752
Hi. Have we
ever met?

11:30.823 --> 11:33.587
No, but I am
a big fan.

11:33.659 --> 11:34.717
I'm Marlene's daughter.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.818
Yeah, I got that.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.954
Right, and I would
love to speak to you

11:38.030 --> 11:40.055
about the ways we can improve our city.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.565
Okay, well,
call my secretary,

11:41.634 --> 11:44.865
and maybe we can set
something up for next month.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.165
Okay. Okay.
Okay. All right.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.637
Next month, then.
Fine. Uh-huh.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.731
Bye.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.908
Andy, I can't
leave now.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.035
I'll get one for you on the way home.

11:54.146 --> 11:58.549
Okay, meatball and ham. Wait, is
that two different subs? Really?

11:58.617 --> 11:59.879
I don't know if
they can do that.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.944
<i>Come on! I'm serious!</i>

12:03.022 --> 12:07.823
<i>Now, the words "too sexy"</i>
<i>aren't really in my vocabulary,</i>

12:08.661 --> 12:11.459
<i>but, Marlene, girl,</i>
<i>you are too sexy!</i>

12:11.530 --> 12:12.963
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:13.799 --> 12:18.668
I refuse to lather Marlene up,
kiss her ring like everybody else.

12:18.971 --> 12:22.270
Instead I'll be delivering
a speech of facts.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.910
<i>Marlene is a woman.</i>

12:26.011 --> 12:30.675
<i>She has worked in the government</i>
<i>for three decades. Thirty years.</i>

12:31.150 --> 12:35.849
<i>Properly applied, that's how</i>
<i>long a good varnish should last.</i>

12:36.422 --> 12:37.821
<i>So, Marlene,</i>

12:38.858 --> 12:41.884
<i>it is true that you</i>
<i>have won this award.</i>

12:42.895 --> 12:45.989
Brendanawicz. Let's bounce.
We're gonna be late.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.300
For what?
Ladies. Scully's Bar.

12:49.368 --> 12:50.801
Let's go. Bounce,
bounce, bounce.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.395
No. Please, you guys are
the only people here I know.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.769
Uh, well, this thing's
kind of wrapping up.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.239
Maybe we could
leave a little later.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.209
Uh, it's 9:30, on a
Friday night in Pawnee.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.404
There's not gonna
be a later, Mark.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.379
Come on, now,
you promised we'd go hit on chicks.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.508
Maybe you and Leslie
can join us at the bar.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.047
Look, I would love to come
hit on chicks with you guys,

13:10.556 --> 13:12.820
but she seems kind of
engaged in something

13:12.892 --> 13:14.689
and I think
I should probably stay.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.920
You'd hit on
chicks? For real?

13:15.995 --> 13:17.223
All right,
you know what?

13:17.296 --> 13:20.163
We're gonna be at Scully's if
you two can tear yourselves away.

13:20.232 --> 13:21.699
TOM: Let's do this, Mark.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.462
It went really
well with Restrepo.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.300
She said I should call her and we
can set something up next month.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.340
Did she say call her
or call her secretary?

13:28.407 --> 13:29.396
Secretary.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.739
That's good, right?
Secretary makes her schedule.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.575
That's great, honey.
She's blowing us off.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.046
What? No! Really?

13:36.115 --> 13:38.015
Honey, she's totally
blowing us off.

13:38.083 --> 13:42.042
What? That is not conduct
worthy of the zoning board.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.089
MARLENE: She's a
little weasel.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.522
Okay, I didn't want
to have to use this,

13:46.592 --> 13:51.029
but her husband got a DUI
in Illinois last week.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.496
And she's trying
to keep it quiet.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.599
Well, everyone
has their problems.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.103
So, what should
my next tactic be?

13:59.171 --> 14:03.005
The DUI, Leslie.
Let her know you know all about it,

14:03.075 --> 14:04.667
connect it to
what you want,

14:04.743 --> 14:07.507
and then tell her if she
doesn't help you, and soon,

14:07.580 --> 14:09.673
you're gonna tell
everybody in town.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.545
I don't think
I could do that.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.085
I mean, I want to win a
Tellenson Award some day.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.450
They don't give lifetime
achievement awards

14:15.521 --> 14:17.148
to people who do
things like that.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.953
Sweetheart, they only give
lifetime achievement awards

14:20.025 --> 14:21.754
to people who do
things like that.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.758
Those are eight of the nastiest,
most diabolical people

14:25.831 --> 14:27.264
you could ever
want to meet.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.062
Bert Winfield
was a blackmailer.

14:29.134 --> 14:32.626
And Dawn Krink slept her
way to the top of the DMV.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.299
Trip Holloway named
names in the '50s.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.673
Horace Rangel used the police
department to harass journalists.

14:38.744 --> 14:42.407
And Jesus, honey.
Tony Tellenson was the worst.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.082
He tried to re-segregate
the drinking fountains.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.083
Hey, Ann,
where's Mark?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.453
He left with Tom.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.617
Shoot! I have a tough assignment,
and I need his help with it.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.058
I could help.
Give me something to do.

14:56.128 --> 14:59.359
Okay, well, apparently Restrepo
was trying to blow us off,

14:59.431 --> 15:00.898
so my mom has a plan.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.059
We're gonna twist
her arm a little bit.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.935
She's trying to cover up for the fact
that she has a husband who likes to

15:07.006 --> 15:09.873
vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom
and glug-glug-glug-glug-glug.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.433
So you're gonna
blackmail her?

15:12.511 --> 15:15.947
No, I'm just gonna get tough
with her, Tellenson-style.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.506
That doesn't sound tough to me,
that sounds slimy.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.415
It sounds like your mom's
telling you to be slimy.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.649
Ann, you don't understand politics.
Look, nursing is easy.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.781
Really? Yeah.
You just go to work,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.291
and people come in,
and you heal them.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.724
But politics is
different, you know?

15:28.794 --> 15:30.853
Sometimes you have
to bring the pain.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.728
You can't let yourself
get taken advantage of.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.767
I think your mom's
giving you bad advice.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.324
I don't think so.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.598
You just do everything
your mom tells you to do?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.106
You just do everything your
boyfriend tells you to do?

15:42.174 --> 15:43.766
Make any pancakes lately?

15:43.842 --> 15:45.070
He has two
broken legs.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.409
Yeah, and he's got three crutches.
And one of them is you!

15:48.480 --> 15:49.572
And the other
two are crutches.

15:49.648 --> 15:51.639
You know, I don't
need to be here.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.175

15:56.055 --> 15:58.922
It's okay. You're
allowed to fight.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.482
You two are just
like everyone else.

Mmm... I'm not sure I'm gonna
be able to get those tonight.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.870
It's called peacocking.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.574
Basically, I'm
wearing something

16:56.648 --> 16:58.513
that kind of makes me
stand out, like a peacock.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.109
So, the girls will be like,
"Hey, what's with that hat?"

17:01.186 --> 17:02.813
I'm gonna go peacock it out.
I'll be back.

Your husband.

I know that your husband
is a drunk driver.

What do you want?

17:54.273 --> 17:55.262

Leave.

I hope your husband gets help and that
you have a long and happy marriage.

18:09.955 --> 18:13.755
Stacy, Becky tells me that you
two are both real estate agents.

18:13.859 --> 18:14.917
That must be fun.

18:14.993 --> 18:15.982

stories you got, huh?

What do you mean?

Like, I don't know,
anything weird or funny happen

18:23.735 --> 18:25.430
when you guys are
showing people houses?

18:25.504 --> 18:26.493
Um...

18:26.905 --> 18:30.238
One time,
I forgot my keys to one of the houses.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.298
(LAUGHING)
MARK: Whoa!

18:31.376 --> 18:32.468
Oh, my God,
you do that, too?

18:32.544 --> 18:33.875
Yeah. I've done that.
That's the worst.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.072
Then you have to drive all the way back,

18:35.147 --> 18:37.012
and then you have to
be like, "I forgot my keys."

18:37.082 --> 18:39.607
(LAUGHING) And then they're like,
"You did that twice."

18:39.685 --> 18:41.915
Look at these guys!
The key-forgetting twins!

18:46.358 --> 18:48.053
I'll be right back.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.327
Can I settle up,
please?

18:50.395 --> 18:51.760
Dude. What is
your problem?

18:51.830 --> 18:54.492
What? Becky and Stacy
are both really into you,

18:54.566 --> 18:57.228
and you're blowing it with them. And
that's making them lose interest in me.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.564
Becky and Stacy are boring.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.831
I need you
back there, man.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.998
I've seen you hook up
with more trashy chicks

19:02.074 --> 19:04.474
in the last year than
I can count, all right?

19:04.543 --> 19:07.376
If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking
up with trashy chicks all the time,

19:07.446 --> 19:09.346
you'd have several
of those awards.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.712
You're the king.
You're my hero.

19:12.451 --> 19:13.748
Tom, I'm gonna
get out of here.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.843
I'll see you Monday, okay?

19:14.920 --> 19:15.909
(SIGHS)

19:20.559 --> 19:22.186
Hey.
Hi.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.188
Come on in.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.289
I just wanted to tell you that
I didn't go through with it,

19:27.366 --> 19:29.197
blackmailing
that woman.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.259
I tried, but I just
couldn't do it.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.463
Good. That's a good thing.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.296
It wasn't you.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.105
You know, there was
definitely some truth

19:39.178 --> 19:42.147
about that thing you
said about me and Andy.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.943
No. What?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.108
Yeah.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.481
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.715
(CHUCKLING) Oh.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.185
Whoa! Hey!
What the hell?

19:54.359 --> 19:56.224
Oh. Hi, Leslie.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.289
I thought you
were a dude.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.591
The people who win awards
aren't always the best people.

20:02.668 --> 20:06.069
I mean, I think Ann and
I are really good people,

20:06.138 --> 20:09.801
<i>and someday others will see</i>
<i>that and we'll get our due.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:13.606
<i>Would I like to win a Tellenson</i>
<i>Award like my mom did? Sure.</i>

20:13.679 --> 20:16.944
<i>But my dad never won an award,</i>
<i>and he was always happy.</i>

20:17.015 --> 20:19.506
<i>He lives in Florida,</i>
<i>in a cemetery.</i>

20:20.152 --> 20:24.521
<i>The point is, my mom is alive and</i>
<i>I love her. She's one tough cookie.</i>

20:24.790 --> 20:29.989
That's why everybody calls her
"The Iron (BLEEP) of Pawnee."

20:32.864 --> 20:33.990
Fondly.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.461
Yes, I'm married.

20:36.535 --> 20:41.029
But my wife understands that a good
politician has to be appealing to the ladies.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.574
The fact that I haven't even
gotten close to cheating on her

20:43.642 --> 20:45.075
is a disappointment
to both of us.

20:45.444 --> 20:48.641
You like the color orange?
Carrots? You into those?
