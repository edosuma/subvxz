WEBVTT

01:45.560 --> 01:46.790
When I was a child...

01:47.500 --> 01:50.100
I remember seeing

01:50.130 --> 01:53.370
a big rainbow over the river

02:05.720 --> 02:07.910
Go away!

02:09.550 --> 02:13.650
At that time my mother told me

02:14.190 --> 02:17.820
"A rainbow is the door to heaven

02:17.930 --> 02:23.700
When people die
they go to heaven through that door"

02:24.270 --> 02:26.700
When I was a child
my father passed away

02:26.740 --> 02:29.370
And my mother went abroad

02:29.910 --> 02:34.900
I wanted my mom to remarry
but she didn't want to

02:39.420 --> 02:42.580
My name is Ji-hae
and my blood type is O

02:42.750 --> 02:45.920
And since I was seven
I learned taekwondo

03:06.340 --> 03:08.440
Are you okay?

03:27.800 --> 03:32.290
This box contains
my parents' letters and diaries

03:32.600 --> 03:38.040
Every time my mother
read the letters, she wept

03:39.140 --> 03:43.600
The refined letters and
the scent of the past...

03:44.620 --> 03:48.980
My mom's first love is in here

04:32.730 --> 04:33.960
Hello?

04:34.330 --> 04:37.030
Ji-hae?
It's me, Soo-gyung

04:38.070 --> 04:39.970
Why are you calling so early?

04:40.270 --> 04:44.910
Wanna go to the art museum
and a play with me and Sang-min?

04:44.940 --> 04:48.000
Hey, are you making me tag along?

04:48.180 --> 04:51.740
No, dummy! Sang-min
asked you to come

04:52.980 --> 04:54.080
Really?

04:54.120 --> 04:56.270
- I'm serious
- I got to know

04:56.300 --> 04:58.420
Sang-min through Soo-gyung

04:59.090 --> 05:05.030
She one day asked me
to write e-mails to Sang-min

05:05.760 --> 05:09.700
For two months, I wrote
letters to him for Soo-gyung

05:09.970 --> 05:13.490
Today, I saw you reading
a book by the bench

05:13.700 --> 05:18.200
It looked like a picture
in a postcard

05:19.680 --> 05:21.770
That's childish

05:22.450 --> 05:24.000
Rewrite it?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.810
No, I like it

05:29.050 --> 05:31.080
I like it being childish

05:32.820 --> 05:35.090
If you still want to marry

05:36.030 --> 05:38.860
I'll give you a curse for a dowry

05:40.630 --> 05:44.800
Sang-min, I sent you a letter
without missing a day

05:46.340 --> 05:49.790
Afterwards, Soo-gyung
signed up for theater

05:49.970 --> 05:52.310
So that she could get close to him

05:53.440 --> 05:56.080
Good-bye
If you still want to marry

05:56.110 --> 05:57.750
marry an idiot instead

05:57.780 --> 06:01.950
The night stained with
pain kept me awake...

06:02.420 --> 06:04.350
The gloomy moonlight has

06:04.820 --> 06:08.330
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
on my window

06:09.390 --> 06:11.790
No, that's not it!

06:13.230 --> 06:15.130
The gloomy moonlight has

06:15.430 --> 06:17.800
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

06:17.840 --> 06:19.330
on my window

06:19.370 --> 06:23.430
Jordan is touched
when Emily comes back to see him

06:23.510 --> 06:26.840
You have to feel both
happy and heartbroken

06:27.840 --> 06:29.810
Do it with more feeling!

06:38.920 --> 06:42.920
When I look at him
I feel breathless

06:43.360 --> 06:46.760
But he never
once looked at me

06:47.100 --> 06:49.230
I'll put a spell on him

06:49.270 --> 06:54.070
Look back! Look back!
Look back! Hey!

07:03.750 --> 07:04.980
Music

07:07.880 --> 07:10.150
When I saw you
for the first time

07:11.090 --> 07:14.750
you already stole my heart

07:15.890 --> 07:18.020
But now that
you came to me

07:18.630 --> 07:20.700
I feel like we'll be together forever

07:20.730 --> 07:21.890
Good

07:22.100 --> 07:25.130
My heart is yours forever

07:26.900 --> 07:27.540
He doesn't make
a lot of gesture

07:27.570 --> 07:29.610
Isn't Sang-min fantastic?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.970
I love guys who are into their work

07:32.980 --> 07:34.240
Saw him?

07:35.010 --> 07:37.640
"No, that's not it!"

07:38.880 --> 07:42.150
The gloomy moonlight has

07:42.320 --> 07:44.050
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

07:44.090 --> 07:46.220
on my window

07:47.690 --> 07:48.780
Talking about me?

07:49.030 --> 07:50.990
It's nothing, Sang-min

07:52.260 --> 07:53.750
You know Ji-hae, right?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.730
She was with me
when I first came here

07:57.230 --> 07:59.760
Right, it's been a while

08:02.370 --> 08:06.400
Yes...
Hello

08:08.580 --> 08:11.050
A lot of girls like him

08:11.310 --> 08:16.320
Not just Soo-gyung

08:16.350 --> 08:18.880
Even the woman working
at the student's hall likes him

09:30.160 --> 09:32.650
Sung Joo-hee

09:34.770 --> 09:37.460
Yoon Tae-soo

09:47.010 --> 09:49.040
Oh Joon-ha?

10:02.260 --> 10:09.100
"When I opened the window this morning
the romantic breeze signaled autumn coming

10:09.330 --> 10:14.860
I'll put that wind
in the letter and send it to you"

10:15.970 --> 10:17.670
Romantic breeze?

10:18.140 --> 10:20.910
That's so cliché

10:23.880 --> 10:27.280
I guess
I'll look at it as a classic

11:36.250 --> 11:37.810
Oh Joon-ha!

11:40.220 --> 11:45.790
Tae-soo came to me all of sudden
whom I've never talked to

11:45.960 --> 11:47.520
Please write me a letter

11:47.930 --> 11:51.890
He heard the rumor
that I write for others

11:52.970 --> 11:57.340
Tae-soo is a friend who grew no less than
36 centimeters during the winter vacation

11:57.380 --> 11:58.310
To who?

11:58.340 --> 12:01.110
To my fiancée

12:02.480 --> 12:04.280
Fiancée?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.350
She's my dad's friend's daughter

12:09.450 --> 12:11.690
They set us up on their own

12:11.720 --> 12:13.050
You're lucky

12:13.160 --> 12:15.820
You don't have to ask
girls out on dates

12:16.330 --> 12:17.450
I'm sick of it

12:17.990 --> 12:20.740
I'm not the type to date one girl

12:20.780 --> 12:23.490
If she mails me
he wants to check it

12:23.730 --> 12:26.030
He wants to know everything

12:26.570 --> 12:29.940
He acts just like a FBI agent

12:33.380 --> 12:34.540
Oh no

12:40.720 --> 12:41.780
She's pretty, huh?

12:41.820 --> 12:46.850
But since she's a congressman's daughter
she'll be shallow

12:50.630 --> 12:52.090
Drive! Drive!

13:01.810 --> 13:05.070
You let them slip out
between your legs

13:05.180 --> 13:06.240
City boys are slow

13:06.280 --> 13:07.880
Suwon isn't a city, Seoul is

13:07.910 --> 13:10.570
Oh Suwon...
But we have a city hall

13:10.880 --> 13:13.380
You catch them
and I'll draw them

13:13.410 --> 13:15.880
Look carefully, idiot
Let's go

13:30.470 --> 13:32.900
What are you doing?

13:34.940 --> 13:40.470
She's Old SUNG's granddaughter
I heard she's from Suwon

13:40.680 --> 13:43.440
- Wait, you're from Suwon, right?
- Yeah

13:44.850 --> 13:50.180
We can never dream of having her
Old SUNG's son is a congressman

13:50.250 --> 13:52.720
So she's a congressman's daughter

13:53.120 --> 13:55.420
Then is she a congressman's son, idiot?

14:05.240 --> 14:05.970
- Oh...
She's...

14:06.000 --> 14:07.100
- She's waving
- Let's wave back!

14:07.140 --> 14:08.440
Hey, wave!

14:08.470 --> 14:11.770
- Hello!
- Hi!

14:13.310 --> 14:14.210
I found one!

14:15.550 --> 14:18.040
Let me see!

14:18.250 --> 14:19.840
Let's see

14:21.020 --> 14:22.580
It stinks

14:27.690 --> 14:29.320
I got one

14:30.060 --> 14:32.190
It's a big one

14:32.830 --> 14:34.730
It sure ate a lot of cow shit

14:41.240 --> 14:42.800
It's a beetle

14:43.710 --> 14:45.540
A beetle?

14:45.680 --> 14:48.410
But I've never seen one

14:51.510 --> 14:55.540
Do you want this?

15:07.460 --> 15:08.730
You wanna bet?

15:10.030 --> 15:13.260
It's cow shit, it's dirty

15:20.110 --> 15:23.780
Have you seen the haunted
house across the river?

15:23.820 --> 15:24.750
What?

15:26.950 --> 15:27.780
Yes

15:28.750 --> 15:32.080
Can you take me there?

15:32.990 --> 15:33.720
Yes

15:34.420 --> 15:36.790
Do you know how to row?

15:38.560 --> 15:39.290
Sure

15:40.260 --> 15:44.600
Then let's meet at the ferry
at twelve tomorrow, okay?

15:57.610 --> 16:00.080
- What did you say to her?
- She said something...

16:00.150 --> 16:03.020
City boys are surely different

16:04.020 --> 16:07.170
Hey, teach me how to row!

16:07.210 --> 16:10.320
You'll teach me, right?

16:49.170 --> 16:56.130
Grandpa told me a lot about it
but forbid me to go

16:56.570 --> 17:00.130
It's strict where ever I go

17:00.540 --> 17:05.410
I really wanted to go,
but I had no one to take me

17:05.780 --> 17:11.310
If I ask the people here
then they'll tell my Grandpa right away

17:17.060 --> 17:23.070
But the boat isn't moving

17:23.100 --> 17:24.500
Gosh!

17:27.170 --> 17:33.370
To be honest
this is my first time rowing

17:43.020 --> 17:46.110
My name is Oh Joon-ha

17:47.120 --> 17:51.890
Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself
I'm Sung Joo-hee

17:52.930 --> 17:54.420
You're from Suwon?

17:54.530 --> 17:55.600
Yes

17:55.630 --> 17:59.760
I'm from Suwon, too
I came here to visit my Uncle

17:59.840 --> 18:04.970
Really?
What a coincidence

18:05.410 --> 18:07.470
Or maybe fate?

18:07.910 --> 18:10.110
- Pardon?
- Oh, nothing

18:44.510 --> 18:48.140
Is there...
really a ghost?

18:54.290 --> 18:57.630
Have you seen...
a ghost before?

18:57.660 --> 19:00.720
Of course
Every day

19:00.900 --> 19:01.990
What?

19:03.400 --> 19:05.230
In the mirror

19:06.800 --> 19:13.370
Actually, I'm a ghost

19:14.410 --> 19:16.610
Stop it

19:44.870 --> 19:47.210
- Are you okay?
- Yes

22:06.050 --> 22:08.210
I think I sprained my ankle

22:10.020 --> 22:11.540
Get on my back

22:12.620 --> 22:14.320
Hurry and get on my back

22:44.420 --> 22:47.620
It's a shower
It'll stop soon

22:56.600 --> 22:58.500
Dry yourself with this

23:15.790 --> 23:20.050
When the rain stops
we'll go along the river

23:20.190 --> 23:23.920
Then we'll reach the ferry
Although it's a bit far

24:15.010 --> 24:16.570
I'm heavy, huh?

24:16.850 --> 24:19.840
Nope
You're not heavy at all

24:20.220 --> 24:23.350
But I weigh a lot
And I eat a lot, too

24:23.390 --> 24:25.250
Don't worry

24:25.290 --> 24:29.490
I can carry you on my back
and go anywhere!

24:29.660 --> 24:30.990
You're lying

24:31.030 --> 24:32.180
I'm not lying

24:32.210 --> 24:33.770
Yes, you are

24:33.800 --> 24:35.320
No, I'm not

25:47.840 --> 25:49.360
I caught it

25:58.180 --> 26:00.080
Open your hands

26:29.650 --> 26:33.580
Hold the firefly for a moment

26:40.720 --> 26:44.630
You gave me a firefly
and carried me

26:45.060 --> 26:50.050
But this is all that
I can give you in return

27:02.110 --> 27:04.940
Please give me the firefly

27:41.650 --> 27:43.520
Thanks for today

28:13.820 --> 28:15.750
She was sick for a few days

28:16.020 --> 28:19.850
and left for a big hospital in Seoul

28:22.360 --> 28:26.020
After her mother died
she got really sick

28:26.200 --> 28:29.290
But when she came back
from the countryside

28:29.370 --> 28:32.390
I heard she got healthier
and looked happier

29:39.440 --> 29:40.800
It's done

29:41.470 --> 29:42.730
Let me see

29:50.180 --> 29:55.240
It was painful to write
the letters for Tae-soo

29:55.820 --> 29:57.720
Because of her

29:58.390 --> 30:00.980
I had a lot to tell her myself

30:02.290 --> 30:03.990
It's great

30:06.000 --> 30:09.690
Can I thank you by showing
you my specialty?

30:10.330 --> 30:11.860
Yes

30:15.700 --> 30:18.740
Wait a sec
You have to open your mouth

30:18.770 --> 30:22.770
When we close our mouths
people will think we faked it

30:24.280 --> 30:25.750
Watch carefully

30:36.530 --> 30:37.960
Know what song this is?

30:38.360 --> 30:39.950
"Moonlight of Shilla"?

30:42.330 --> 30:44.160
You punks!

30:44.200 --> 30:45.860
Why haven't you finished your chores?

30:45.930 --> 30:48.700
Are you bastards playing hooky?

30:48.900 --> 30:51.270
I'll check later
so make it spotless!

30:51.810 --> 30:56.710
And what's this smell?
Did someone take a shit here?

30:57.210 --> 30:58.470
Joon-ha!

30:59.850 --> 31:01.650
Oh Joon-ha!

31:02.680 --> 31:04.210
Oh Joon-ha!

31:04.420 --> 31:06.390
Joon-ha!
Oh Joon-ha!

31:08.560 --> 31:11.920
Are you crazy to scream in a library?

31:14.160 --> 31:16.390
Look, it's an invitation

31:18.870 --> 31:21.170
Is everyone here Oh Joon-ha?

31:21.740 --> 31:23.970
Nosey bastards

32:13.120 --> 32:14.420
Thank you

32:14.460 --> 32:17.930
Next is sophomore
Sung Joo-hee

32:17.960 --> 32:22.990
She will play Beethoven's
Sonata 8 on the piano

32:23.070 --> 32:26.730
Welcome with warm applause

33:47.550 --> 33:49.050
Joo-hee, you must be hungry

33:49.090 --> 33:51.110
I bet you're hungry

35:23.510 --> 35:26.240
- Thank you
- Congratulations

35:28.320 --> 35:31.480
Is your ankle better?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.650
Yes

35:35.320 --> 35:36.990
And your cold?

35:38.690 --> 35:39.690
Yes

35:39.730 --> 35:41.960
I was very worried about you

35:42.960 --> 35:48.200
And I enjoyed your performance

35:48.900 --> 35:51.530
I have to practice more

35:53.780 --> 35:56.540
Everyone's waiting

35:56.750 --> 35:58.980
I snuck out

36:08.220 --> 36:12.020
I still have the firefly

36:12.430 --> 36:14.730
It's in good health, like me

37:34.680 --> 37:36.010
Hi

37:36.080 --> 37:37.200
Sorry, I'm late

37:37.510 --> 37:38.040
Mmm...

37:39.010 --> 37:41.850
Hi, Ji-hae

37:42.150 --> 37:46.220
Sang-min, I won
We made a bet

37:46.250 --> 37:51.020
I bet you'd come
and Sang-min bet you wouldn't

37:51.860 --> 37:53.950
You have to treat dinner

37:54.160 --> 37:55.860
Okay, I will

39:15.580 --> 39:17.070
What are you looking at?

39:32.230 --> 39:34.020
I have to go

39:34.300 --> 39:35.960
Why are you going so early?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.400
Sang-min is treating us to dinner

39:38.470 --> 39:40.400
Three's a crowd

39:40.440 --> 39:44.390
You bad girl
You're too smart

39:44.740 --> 39:48.700
Sang-min!
Ji-hae said she's leaving

39:50.550 --> 39:52.280
But you should eat with us

39:52.310 --> 39:54.850
And we can talk
about the play, too

39:54.880 --> 39:57.720
Ji-hae never changes her mind

39:57.820 --> 39:59.750
Right, Ji-hae?

40:00.620 --> 40:01.870
Right

40:01.910 --> 40:03.120
See?

40:03.330 --> 40:06.780
That's too bad
It would've been nice if you came

40:08.260 --> 40:11.530
Ever seen Sang-min treat
anyone like this?

40:11.700 --> 40:15.260
He's doing this
because you're my friend

40:15.400 --> 40:19.240
He's just being nice
so you can go, It's okay

40:31.720 --> 40:33.280
Wait!

40:38.760 --> 40:41.490
I bought presents today

40:41.560 --> 40:43.930
I also got you one,
so you wouldn't feel alone

40:45.430 --> 40:51.300
I bet you won't be able to sleep tonight
This isn't like Sang-min

40:51.470 --> 40:53.240
It's because you're a good friend

40:53.270 --> 40:56.440
If it wasn't for me
you'd never get this

40:57.210 --> 40:59.080
Pick one

41:06.990 --> 41:08.580
Ji-hae!

41:09.860 --> 41:11.260
Ji-hae...

41:11.290 --> 41:13.310
I like your present better

41:13.340 --> 41:15.330
It's okay to switch, right?

41:16.030 --> 41:17.860
Bye!

42:09.680 --> 42:14.880
"When the sun shines
on the sea, I think of you

42:15.490 --> 42:19.890
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you"

42:20.100 --> 42:22.400
Really?
Is that what it says?

42:22.430 --> 42:23.900
Gee!

42:23.930 --> 42:27.230
Oh my gosh
Sang-min must really like me a lot

42:27.570 --> 42:30.340
You have to give it
to me tomorrow, okay?

42:30.370 --> 42:31.400
Okay

42:35.380 --> 42:39.180
I have no reason to
see him anymore

42:40.080 --> 42:42.710
He wants to be
with Soo-gyung now

42:43.150 --> 42:45.810
When the sun shines
on the sea...

42:46.090 --> 42:49.060
When the dim moonlight
is on the spring...

42:56.700 --> 42:57.720
Are you done?

42:58.100 --> 43:00.070
Wait a little longer

43:04.640 --> 43:06.570
Hand in your manure

43:06.640 --> 43:09.110
in an envelope after lunch

43:09.340 --> 43:11.240
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

43:11.280 --> 43:13.980
Those who didn't bring it
hurry and go take a shit!

43:14.020 --> 43:15.880
Got it?

43:20.760 --> 43:22.190
Let's get together!

44:38.000 --> 44:39.300
One! Two!

44:39.340 --> 44:40.620
One! Two!

44:40.650 --> 44:41.690
One! Two!

44:41.730 --> 44:42.730
Joon-ha

44:42.840 --> 44:47.370
I'll close my eyes and run
so you guide me, okay?

44:47.510 --> 44:48.680
I'm really closing them

44:48.710 --> 44:50.110
Okay

44:50.380 --> 44:51.610
Joon-ha

44:51.750 --> 44:56.270
Wanna come with me to learn
the folk dance after class?

44:56.520 --> 44:58.020
Folk?

44:58.050 --> 44:59.990
I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there

45:00.120 --> 45:03.290
It's my dad and his friend's idea

45:03.320 --> 45:06.160
They want us to meet
at a healthy recreation

45:06.190 --> 45:08.990
A lot of girls will be there
so you pick one up

45:09.100 --> 45:11.500
- Gonna come, right?
- I don't know

45:17.170 --> 45:18.730
Tae-soo!

45:31.620 --> 45:35.210
Joo-hee, this is my friend Oh Joon-ha

45:35.360 --> 45:37.820
She's the one
I told you about

45:39.030 --> 45:43.090
I'm Oh Joon-ha
Nice to meet you

45:43.870 --> 45:49.530
Hello
Are you two friends?

45:50.170 --> 45:53.140
Know each other?

45:53.340 --> 45:55.740
No, we don't

45:58.250 --> 46:01.700
He's my best friend

46:05.950 --> 46:10.760
This is my friend, Na-hee

46:10.990 --> 46:14.390
Hi, I'm Na Na-hee

46:14.760 --> 46:16.900
- I'm YOON Tae-soo
- I'm Oh Joon-ha

46:16.930 --> 46:18.900
Everyone please have a seat

46:18.940 --> 46:20.560
Come on!

46:20.900 --> 46:23.030
Anywhere is fine

46:39.490 --> 46:43.730
Today I will teach you the folk dance

46:43.760 --> 46:45.820
- Sounds fun, right?
- Yes

46:45.890 --> 46:48.920
Folk Dance is...

46:49.000 --> 46:51.120
I missed you

46:58.510 --> 47:00.500
Me, too

47:44.720 --> 47:47.780
I didn't know
you were Tae-soo's friend

49:21.820 --> 49:24.880
I want to be a woman anchor

49:25.220 --> 49:27.920
So I always practice my speech

49:28.160 --> 49:30.560
Can you do this?

49:30.760 --> 49:34.750
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

49:34.860 --> 49:38.390
Did I do okay?
I can do it faster

49:38.700 --> 49:41.860
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

49:42.240 --> 49:43.640
Shall I do it faster?

49:43.740 --> 49:47.110
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

49:47.210 --> 49:49.300
Give it a try

49:50.780 --> 49:56.440
Peter Piper a pecked
of peppers pickled...

49:57.720 --> 50:01.990
You'll need a lot of practice
Repeat precisely after me

50:02.020 --> 50:08.390
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

50:09.100 --> 50:10.830
We should split up now

50:16.140 --> 50:19.970
I'll take Joo-hee home
so you take care of Na-hee

50:20.140 --> 50:23.240
Okay?
See you later

50:24.010 --> 50:27.540
I had fun
Good night

50:27.650 --> 50:29.640
Bye, Joo-hee

50:29.780 --> 50:30.810
Good night

50:54.540 --> 50:58.270
What are you doing?
Let's get going

51:02.920 --> 51:04.350
Joon-ha

51:05.150 --> 51:08.210
then try something easier

51:08.490 --> 51:09.720
Try this

51:09.960 --> 51:15.220
She sells seashells by the seashore

51:15.360 --> 51:19.060
Easy, huh?
Give it a try

51:19.170 --> 51:20.300
Pardon?

51:20.330 --> 51:22.230
I said give it a try

51:23.370 --> 51:25.030
Give what a try?

51:25.240 --> 51:30.280
She sells seashells
by the seashore

51:30.310 --> 51:32.710
Give this a try

51:32.780 --> 51:36.340
I can't
Please don't ask me to

51:36.450 --> 51:38.010
You can't do this?

51:38.220 --> 51:43.390
She sells seashells
by the seashore

51:43.430 --> 51:44.720
It's easy

51:44.760 --> 51:50.390
She sells seashells
by the seashore

52:02.510 --> 52:04.150
- Have a good...
- Yes...

52:04.180 --> 52:06.080
Good-bye

54:13.740 --> 54:15.170
The card

54:22.120 --> 54:24.850
I should've known
there'd be a card for me

54:57.650 --> 54:59.180
Ji-hae?

55:01.460 --> 55:03.180
Oh, hello

55:11.630 --> 55:13.260
Where are you headed?

55:15.570 --> 55:17.060
To the library

55:17.370 --> 55:18.770
That far?

55:20.110 --> 55:21.570
It's not far

55:21.810 --> 55:26.040
I won't get so wet
if I stop at each building

55:34.860 --> 55:37.590
Then I'll take you there

55:37.860 --> 55:39.550
With my special umbrella

55:42.900 --> 55:46.630
Think of that building
as a shed and run

55:47.070 --> 55:50.470
One, Two, Three!

57:39.210 --> 57:40.110
How are you?

57:46.450 --> 57:48.220
Thanks so much

57:48.960 --> 57:51.650
But you're soaked

57:51.860 --> 57:54.090
I was going to
get wet anyway

58:00.330 --> 58:03.600
I should be going
Thanks again

58:03.640 --> 58:06.870
- Okay, I'll see you later
- OK!

58:29.460 --> 58:32.920
I didn't think
we'd meet again

58:33.130 --> 58:35.900
But why does the library
have to be so close?

58:58.390 --> 59:02.950
She hasn't mailed me back yet

59:05.770 --> 59:08.360
- Joo-hee?
- Yeah

59:10.940 --> 59:12.910
- Why not?
- I don't know

59:14.110 --> 59:17.980
I'm not the type
to fall in love with one girl

59:18.350 --> 59:21.680
But I must really like her

59:23.880 --> 59:24.710
Tae-soo!

59:24.820 --> 59:25.750
Tae-soo!

59:35.100 --> 59:36.890
Tae-soo?

59:37.100 --> 59:38.690
Hi

59:39.500 --> 59:42.400
What are you doing here?

59:42.770 --> 59:45.500
I was waiting for you

59:47.740 --> 59:49.640
Please take these flowers

59:52.580 --> 59:57.020
I like you, Joo-hee

1:00:04.190 --> 1:00:07.180
Please write to me

1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:19.430
It's so strange
Is it because I'm too tall?

1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:21.640
Why do I keep fainting?

1:00:34.590 --> 1:00:36.750
I'm out of breath

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:17.790
It's because of Tae-soo, right?

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:22.060
What do you think
I should do?

1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.160
Tell me

1:01:29.310 --> 1:01:31.740
Tae-soo is a rotten bastard

1:01:31.950 --> 1:01:34.240
No, Tae-soo is nice

1:01:36.050 --> 1:01:41.420
He's a rotten bastard
because he's too nice

1:01:43.290 --> 1:01:48.630
Tae-soo is waiting for your letter

1:01:54.770 --> 1:01:57.760
There's no hope

1:01:58.770 --> 1:02:01.940
There's nothing
we can do for us

1:02:02.410 --> 1:02:07.240
Don't say that

1:02:13.620 --> 1:02:15.210
There's a way

1:02:16.460 --> 1:02:19.480
No, there's nothing more we can do

1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:22.390
Nothing

1:02:23.430 --> 1:02:25.760
We'll only get hurt

1:02:37.710 --> 1:02:40.340
It'll work out

1:02:47.020 --> 1:02:52.050
I won't see neither you
nor Tae-soo anymore

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:54.880
I'm serious

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.690
I won't see anyone

1:03:24.830 --> 1:03:26.620
Hey, limousine boy!

1:03:27.090 --> 1:03:28.430
Come here

1:03:29.930 --> 1:03:33.060
Limousine boy!
Forgot to bow?

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:38.500
So you don't wanna bow
is that it?

1:03:38.810 --> 1:03:44.270
If you have a chauffeur
you don't have to bow, huh?

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:49.980
Your badge is upside down
and your shirt's unbuttoned

1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:54.550
Fine, today I'll give you
the worst beating ever

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:06.320
I'm gonna beat you
all starting from the left

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:09.960
The first one gets hit once
the second one gets hit twice

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:14.070
From the third
shout out your turn

1:04:14.110 --> 1:04:15.940
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

1:04:15.980 --> 1:04:19.540
- You sissies, I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

1:04:19.850 --> 1:04:21.510
Seven

1:04:24.950 --> 1:04:26.940
Stay still!

1:04:33.630 --> 1:04:37.150
- Ouch, my back
- Stay still, or I'll break your arm

1:04:45.510 --> 1:04:48.800
You get one more beating
Get into position!

1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:52.900
Listen to what I said
and get into position!

1:05:00.590 --> 1:05:02.350
What's the count?

1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:05.350
I said what's the count?

1:05:05.830 --> 1:05:09.850
Then I'll tell you
You're nineteen

1:05:11.870 --> 1:05:13.260
One

1:05:14.070 --> 1:05:15.800
Two

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:19.290
Three!

1:05:20.670 --> 1:05:24.630
Hey, get up!
Get up!

1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.090
Hey, Hey!
What's wrong with you?

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:34.350
It's about Joo-hee

1:05:35.860 --> 1:05:39.260
I don't think she likes me

1:05:40.030 --> 1:05:43.720
I gave her flowers
and even kissed her

1:05:43.830 --> 1:05:45.760
but there's no response

1:05:46.030 --> 1:05:47.900
You kissed her?

1:05:48.740 --> 1:05:50.170
Yeah

1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:02.010
When the sun shines on the sea
I think of you

1:07:02.110 --> 1:07:06.410
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you

1:07:49.890 --> 1:07:53.760
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

1:08:27.330 --> 1:08:28.520
Dummy

1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:31.230
Do you want to get electrocuted?

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.160
You're crazy

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:36.060
I don't want to split up like this

1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:38.630
Let's talk just for a moment

1:08:38.710 --> 1:08:40.040
Nothing can change

1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:44.340
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:45.760
Here's your letter

1:09:45.870 --> 1:09:47.700
I don't want it anymore

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:49.230
Why?

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:53.280
There's no response
and because of my conscience

1:09:53.550 --> 1:09:56.010
I'll write it myself from now on

1:09:56.380 --> 1:09:58.510
And tell her the truth

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:02.650
It's a golden opportunity

1:10:02.860 --> 1:10:06.920
I heard she's very sick from the rain

1:10:07.590 --> 1:10:10.590
So she's in the hospital

1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:14.430
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

1:10:14.470 --> 1:10:16.030
Yeah

1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:19.160
I'm going to see her

1:10:19.570 --> 1:10:23.570
If I visit her when she's sick
then I can score

1:10:24.980 --> 1:10:29.380
I'll confess to her that
I didn't write the letters

1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.280
I won't tell her
it was you

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:37.120
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:41.330
but I really like her

1:10:41.590 --> 1:10:43.490
Oh Joon-ha!

1:10:43.930 --> 1:10:45.690
Oh Joon-ha!

1:10:45.930 --> 1:10:47.400
He's calling you

1:10:47.830 --> 1:10:48.570
Yes?

1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:53.770
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

1:10:55.580 --> 1:10:56.940
I have to eat all this?

1:10:56.980 --> 1:10:58.380
Look at this

1:10:58.410 --> 1:11:02.250
Maw worms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:05.550
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

1:11:05.690 --> 1:11:08.590
Because of you
our class has the most parasites

1:11:08.690 --> 1:11:11.090
But sir
it wasn't my manure

1:11:11.130 --> 1:11:12.790
Then whose was it?

1:11:13.090 --> 1:11:17.960
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

1:11:33.780 --> 1:11:35.680
YOON Tae-soo

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:41.410
Eat three

1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:44.090
But it's the same manure

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:48.890
Yeah, but some spots have
more parasites and some don't

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:11.210
How'd you know
I was here?

1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:12.320
Why are you covering your face?

1:12:12.350 --> 1:12:17.320
Stop it, I haven't washed
my face, and it's dirty

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:18.950
But you're still pretty

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:22.290
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:26.360
Why are you laughing?

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:31.670
I heard you ate
32 worm-killing pills

1:12:32.410 --> 1:12:36.310
Tae-soo, that bastard
has a big mouth

1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:40.470
Did he say anything else?

1:12:46.390 --> 1:12:54.950
After being silent for a while
that's all he said and left

1:12:55.300 --> 1:12:57.420
- Really?
- Yeah

1:12:57.830 --> 1:13:00.130
He's so odd

1:13:03.470 --> 1:13:06.460
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:10.680
I'm sorry

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:15.210
I must be really stupid

1:13:15.550 --> 1:13:20.920
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

1:13:24.690 --> 1:13:27.180
No, there's a lot
you're good at

1:13:27.330 --> 1:13:30.490
Like getting drenched
and eating worm pills

1:13:31.030 --> 1:13:35.630
Don't laugh
This is serious

1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:41.500
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

1:13:41.570 --> 1:13:46.310
Then we can clear our conscience

1:13:49.750 --> 1:13:51.230
See you later

1:13:51.270 --> 1:13:52.710
Is this her room?

1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:02.420
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:05.260
No, lie down

1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:11.500
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:14.010
So, are you eating well?

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:18.740
You should eat well to recover

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:26.180
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:46.300
Wrong room

1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:02.010
Clench your fists

1:15:06.630 --> 1:15:08.120
Raise them like this

1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:15.570
Now hit me

1:15:15.670 --> 1:15:16.850
Why should I hit you?

1:15:16.890 --> 1:15:18.030
Hurry and hit me!

1:15:18.370 --> 1:15:22.570
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:24.280
My dad hit me too many times

1:15:24.310 --> 1:15:25.940
I like Joo-hee

1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:31.640
Actually, she gave me
this necklace last summer

1:15:34.390 --> 1:15:36.180
Are you okay?

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:41.180
Damn it
I've fallen again

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.720
Don't worry

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.600
And don't let my dad
see that necklace

1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:52.670
He'll get furious

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:59.040
That necklace was
a gift from my dad

1:15:59.710 --> 1:16:01.010
To Joo-hee

1:16:07.990 --> 1:16:11.480
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

1:16:12.130 --> 1:16:15.320
Later on, we went
on school break

1:16:15.530 --> 1:16:20.730
And I thought
I couldn't see her again

1:16:20.770 --> 1:16:22.630
I miss you

1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:26.060
I miss you so much I'll die

1:16:26.470 --> 1:16:31.270
And I'm curious how much
our river has changed

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:38.370
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:42.980
Say that I miss them
and that I'm doing okay

1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:48.890
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to
me with your Uncle's address

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:53.930
He also confessed
a shocking thing to me

1:16:54.300 --> 1:16:59.290
That you were the one
who wrote the letters to me

1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:02.840
How could you
hide that from me?

1:17:04.610 --> 1:17:06.810
Anyway, it's okay

1:17:07.050 --> 1:17:12.020
I almost threw away
those letters

1:17:12.050 --> 1:17:15.280
but now I can read them again
and think of you

1:17:16.420 --> 1:17:20.190
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:25.590
That you put Tae-soo's name
on the letters you send me

1:17:25.770 --> 1:17:31.290
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

1:17:33.910 --> 1:17:35.840
Look outside the window

1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:38.840
If the branches swing
gently in the wind

1:17:38.980 --> 1:17:43.610
then the one
you love is loving you, too

1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:48.790
Right now
it's snowing outside

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:50.090
When it first snows

1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:54.490
they say you should
stroll with your beloved

1:17:54.730 --> 1:17:57.360
But I'm just writing a letter

1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.990
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:05.190
I'm going to get permission
to go to Grandpa's house

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.470
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

1:18:09.610 --> 1:18:11.510
Open your ears

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:13.910
If you hear your heartbeat

1:18:14.110 --> 1:18:18.610
then the person
you love is loving you, too

1:18:19.020 --> 1:18:20.580
Close your eyes

1:18:20.790 --> 1:18:23.120
If there's a smile
on your lips

1:18:23.190 --> 1:18:27.960
then the person
you love is loving you, too

1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:52.980
I want to send a telegraph

1:18:54.450 --> 1:18:56.420
Then please sign up here

1:18:56.460 --> 1:18:57.820
Okay

1:19:07.030 --> 1:19:11.270
But fate must not be on my side

1:19:11.740 --> 1:19:13.570
One of my letters

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.170
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

1:19:17.210 --> 1:19:20.500
Joo-hee is
in love with Joon-ha

1:19:20.910 --> 1:19:27.580
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

1:19:29.390 --> 1:19:34.950
Both of them really
love each other

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:40.990
So that's why I gave up

1:19:42.070 --> 1:19:44.560
Two people in love
should be together

1:19:46.770 --> 1:19:49.670
It's okay with me

1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:53.840
No, I love her, too

1:19:54.310 --> 1:19:56.580
I won't give up

1:19:56.820 --> 1:20:04.720
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

1:20:06.390 --> 1:20:12.260
So your parents mean nothing to you?

1:20:12.330 --> 1:20:17.130
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.370
Know what that means, you punk?

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:28.240
You deserve to die

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:30.010
You can't even hold on to a girl

1:20:47.470 --> 1:20:50.090
It was the end of a winter break?

1:20:50.270 --> 1:20:52.930
I had hoped so much for

1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:19.800
Know what this is?

1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:22.430
A belt?

1:21:22.470 --> 1:21:25.960
No, it's a whip

1:21:26.370 --> 1:21:28.600
This bastard hits me

1:21:28.910 --> 1:21:34.280
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:43.350
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

1:21:44.390 --> 1:21:45.720
The death penalty

1:21:48.090 --> 1:21:50.960
That's exactly what I thought

1:21:56.670 --> 1:22:00.370
Kill it slowly and painfully?

1:22:01.710 --> 1:22:07.540
Or starve it slowly to death?

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:11.620
Or give it sleeping pills?

1:22:11.650 --> 1:22:13.520
Strangle it to death

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:18.750
Good idea

1:22:24.730 --> 1:22:26.560
Joon-ha

1:22:28.870 --> 1:22:32.670
Take good care of Joo-hee

1:23:52.050 --> 1:23:53.750
Tae-soo!

1:23:54.790 --> 1:23:58.920
Somebody help!

1:23:59.390 --> 1:24:02.220
A person's dying!

1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:04.330
Tae-soo, you bastard!

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:05.860
Tae-soo, you bastard!

1:24:05.900 --> 1:24:08.570
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:13.770
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

1:24:13.810 --> 1:24:17.610
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

1:24:19.380 --> 1:24:25.040
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

1:24:26.420 --> 1:24:30.750
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:39.060
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

1:24:39.130 --> 1:24:43.220
Breathe! Breathe!

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:47.300
Breathe, you bastard!

1:25:38.590 --> 1:25:40.920
Go inside

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:57.510
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

1:26:02.850 --> 1:26:05.110
Hurry

1:26:17.860 --> 1:26:20.330
Wait here for me

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:52.090
Hurry and get well

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:46.030
Ji-hae, know what this is?

1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:48.600
An umbrella?

1:29:49.310 --> 1:29:51.760
A very special umbrella

1:29:51.790 --> 1:29:54.200
They're all the same

1:29:54.780 --> 1:30:00.150
It's special because
Sang-min gave it to me

1:30:00.850 --> 1:30:04.760
He must know that I like him

1:30:04.790 --> 1:30:09.780
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

1:30:10.300 --> 1:30:13.130
Go give this to Sang-min

1:30:13.170 --> 1:30:16.900
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

1:30:16.940 --> 1:30:18.460
Why not?

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:21.440
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:27.910
Remember when it
suddenly rained that day?

1:30:28.250 --> 1:30:32.110
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:36.950
He was looking out of the window

1:30:37.020 --> 1:30:41.760
then suddenly turned to me and said

1:30:43.630 --> 1:30:47.900
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

1:30:48.230 --> 1:30:53.140
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:59.240
He placed his umbrella here

1:30:59.850 --> 1:31:03.470
and said
"You can have it"

1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:06.750
He said he was okay to get wet

1:31:06.950 --> 1:31:10.820
And then he ran off in the rain

1:31:19.770 --> 1:31:22.760
Did you bring an umbrella?

1:31:27.470 --> 1:31:30.410
You can have it.

1:31:35.750 --> 1:31:40.150
It's raining a lot outside

1:31:40.190 --> 1:31:44.880
Sang-min might be getting soaked
without an umbrella

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:06.280
This is a really special umbrella

1:32:07.550 --> 1:32:11.450
I'll give it back to him

1:32:18.290 --> 1:32:21.350
Did you bring an umbrella?

1:32:21.530 --> 1:32:23.160
Of course, I did

1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:24.590
Really?

1:32:26.230 --> 1:32:27.890
But still, take mine

1:32:33.270 --> 1:32:34.800
Is she crazy?

1:33:53.950 --> 1:33:57.480
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:02.280
It's not mine

1:34:02.530 --> 1:34:04.960
I came to return it to you

1:34:05.630 --> 1:34:08.330
You left it at the store

1:34:10.540 --> 1:34:17.530
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:25.350
Don't go

1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:39.060
You already know...

1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:41.690
my feelings

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:47.600
Now, you know it all

1:34:53.450 --> 1:34:55.070
Yeah

1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:00.280
when I saw you run
without an umbrella

1:35:02.250 --> 1:35:04.720
I left my umbrella behind

1:35:08.730 --> 1:35:11.320
Even on the day of the play

1:35:13.270 --> 1:35:18.760
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

1:35:20.610 --> 1:35:23.940
And if fate was on my side

1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:29.980
I thought you'd pick
the gift with the card in it

1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:34.750
I thought we'd grow distant

1:35:35.850 --> 1:35:38.480
if I confessed my feelings

1:35:38.590 --> 1:35:43.290
I wanted to say
that I liked you, but I couldn't

1:35:43.930 --> 1:35:47.830
I'll come see the play

1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:01.710
Look
I cut my wrists

1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:08.010
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

1:36:08.290 --> 1:36:10.690
Do you really love her?

1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:12.790
Is it really so?

1:36:12.820 --> 1:36:15.020
I'm working out my feelings

1:36:15.590 --> 1:36:18.860
My eyes were looking straight

1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:21.020
but my heart was confused

1:36:21.170 --> 1:36:24.260
Can I trust those words?

1:36:25.170 --> 1:36:28.300
Can I think of it as a promise?

1:36:29.110 --> 1:36:31.170
Yes

1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:35.680
There's only one that I love

1:36:36.750 --> 1:36:39.480
That one is me, right?

1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:41.080
Yes, I love you

1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:43.150
I swear that I love you

1:36:43.190 --> 1:36:45.690
I love you, too

1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:47.730
Sang-min
I love you so much

1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:49.160
Sang-min!

1:37:09.610 --> 1:37:11.780
What the hell are you doing?

1:37:12.050 --> 1:37:15.250
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

1:37:15.550 --> 1:37:17.060
You can’t just change
your lines like that

1:37:17.090 --> 1:37:18.620
You ruined everything!

1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:21.430
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

1:37:21.460 --> 1:37:24.200
I love you
Love is more important than a play

1:37:24.230 --> 1:37:25.360
I love you

1:37:54.330 --> 1:37:57.260
After the play
Sang-min and I went on a date

1:37:57.400 --> 1:37:59.560
We decided to go to the river

1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:05.030
where my mother's memories lay

1:38:13.210 --> 1:38:14.840
Joo-hee?

1:38:18.050 --> 1:38:22.350
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

1:38:22.390 --> 1:38:24.220
Is that so?

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:26.610
I must've made a mistake

1:38:27.030 --> 1:38:30.050
But you look so much like your mom

1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:35.830
I delivered a lot of
your mom's letters

1:38:35.870 --> 1:38:37.130
Thank you, sir

1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:03.420
I know well what happened to
my parents afterwards

1:39:07.170 --> 1:39:09.600
Students and citizens!

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.840
This is illegal demonstrations!

1:39:16.410 --> 1:39:18.780
Eliminate corruption
and establish a new state! A new state!

1:39:18.810 --> 1:39:21.080
Down with dictatorship
and the military regime!

1:39:21.110 --> 1:39:23.340
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

1:40:01.590 --> 1:40:05.720
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

1:40:07.890 --> 1:40:11.520
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

1:40:12.460 --> 1:40:14.520
Put on toothpaste

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:50.130
It's been a long time

1:40:52.170 --> 1:40:53.970
It has

1:40:56.940 --> 1:41:03.370
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:26.160
Joon-ha!

1:42:27.100 --> 1:42:28.960
Joon-ha!

1:42:29.870 --> 1:42:31.800
Joon-ha!

1:42:40.250 --> 1:42:42.210
Joon-ha!

1:42:42.710 --> 1:42:44.410
Joon-ha!

1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:52.250
Joon-ha!

1:42:56.730 --> 1:43:01.690
Joon-ha
come back alive!

1:43:03.570 --> 1:43:09.970
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

1:43:10.580 --> 1:43:12.200
Joon-ha!

1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:17.210
Joon-ha
answer me!

1:43:17.450 --> 1:43:19.180
Joon-ha!

1:43:25.420 --> 1:43:30.660
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

1:43:32.230 --> 1:43:37.900
Joon-ha
come back alive!

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:42.000
Joon-ha!

1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:53.110
Joon-ha!

1:43:54.420 --> 1:43:55.780
Joon-ha!

1:43:57.460 --> 1:43:58.820
Joon-ha!

1:43:59.490 --> 1:44:00.890
Joon-ha!

1:44:02.830 --> 1:44:04.060
Joon-ha!

1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:08.390
Joon-ha!

1:44:09.870 --> 1:44:11.700
Joo-hee!

1:44:18.510 --> 1:44:20.740
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

1:44:23.580 --> 1:44:24.720
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

1:44:24.750 --> 1:44:25.770
Tae-soo!

1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.310
Joon-ha!

1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:32.180
Joon-ha!

1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:36.630
Joon-ha!

1:44:40.670 --> 1:44:44.000
You have to come back alive!

1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:45.590
Joon-ha!

1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.730
Joon-ha
come back alive!

1:44:50.710 --> 1:44:53.400
You have to come back alive!

1:44:55.310 --> 1:44:56.470
Got it?

1:46:52.300 --> 1:46:55.930
Medic! Medic!

1:46:57.570 --> 1:47:00.770
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

1:47:01.510 --> 1:47:02.870
Stop it!

1:47:02.940 --> 1:47:05.740
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

1:48:10.070 --> 1:48:11.470
Joon-ha, you bastard!

1:48:11.810 --> 1:48:14.780
Where are you going?

1:48:15.250 --> 1:48:18.240
Come back!
Corporal OH!

1:52:22.730 --> 1:52:28.430
You haven't changed at all

1:52:29.300 --> 1:52:31.890
Just like in the past

1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:35.160
you're still pretty

1:52:38.610 --> 1:52:42.810
I've aged a lot

1:52:53.590 --> 1:52:59.620
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

1:53:07.970 --> 1:53:10.960
How's Tae-soo doing?

1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:16.680
I guess he's doing alright

1:53:26.390 --> 1:53:31.120
Why didn't you get married?

1:53:36.270 --> 1:53:40.330
Well, I did

1:53:48.850 --> 1:53:52.010
I heard

1:53:57.550 --> 1:54:00.350
I had so much to tell you

1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:06.050
But now that we've met
I can't remember

1:54:21.010 --> 1:54:24.000
It's a piano doll

1:54:24.150 --> 1:54:26.810
We have one
at my home, too

1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:34.860
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

1:54:42.130 --> 1:54:45.300
It looks so much like you back then

1:54:46.270 --> 1:54:48.430
Doesn't it?

1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:06.780
We were so innocent back then

1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:09.850
But the past has gone now

1:55:11.030 --> 1:55:16.430
I think our feelings
took the best of us

1:55:16.460 --> 1:55:21.830
We cried and laughed
at the smallest things

1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:54.800
How do I look right now?

1:55:57.310 --> 1:55:59.570
You look healthy

1:56:00.340 --> 1:56:07.980
But I'd like to see
you look happier

1:56:12.590 --> 1:56:19.500
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:32.440
Why did you hide that
you couldn't see?

1:56:43.090 --> 1:56:44.950
It's late

1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.750
Sorry, I have an appointment

1:56:47.930 --> 1:56:50.020
I have to go

1:57:43.150 --> 1:57:44.840
I'm sorry

1:57:44.980 --> 1:57:50.110
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:56.120
I even came here
last night to practice

1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:01.350
You almost fooled me

1:58:02.630 --> 1:58:09.000
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

1:58:10.010 --> 1:58:12.200
Also...

1:58:16.180 --> 1:58:22.240
I risked my life to return
this necklace to you

1:58:30.530 --> 1:58:32.590
Please don't

1:58:36.130 --> 1:58:38.730
This necklace is yours

1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:45.630
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:51.300
Then a few years later...

2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:30.950
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

2:00:40.820 --> 2:00:42.720
Joon-ha's last wish

2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:52.260
was for you to spread
his dust in this river

2:00:56.640 --> 2:00:58.540
Actually

2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:01.440
Joon-ha

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:08.150
got married right
after you did

2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:17.390
Poor guy had a son, too

2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:45.950
And Joon-ha

2:01:46.220 --> 2:01:49.820
wanted you to have this

2:02:49.550 --> 2:02:51.920
Mommy, it's a rainbow

2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:05.260
I still remember clearly
the rainbow I saw that day

2:03:05.340 --> 2:03:09.860
Until I finished telling this story

2:07:11.580 --> 2:07:13.050
Open your hands
