00:00.600 --> 00:02.401
You should have told her...

00:02.403 --> 00:04.837
I was. Y'all robbed me
of my chance to tell her.

00:04.839 --> 00:05.437
from the beginning.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.705
[scoffs]

00:06.707 --> 00:08.674
<i>[Karen] I'm glad I spread
on my [bleep] repellent.</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:11.710
He robbed himself
of the opportunity

00:11.712 --> 00:16.015
when he neglected to tell
he had two kids six years ago.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.751
[Winter] I would like
to get married to Jah.

00:18.753 --> 00:23.222
He should've proposed to you,
like, maybe the second year.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.890
Well, I mean, he asked me,
but I said no.

00:24.892 --> 00:25.824
[groans]

00:25.826 --> 00:27.960
Are you planning on seeing

00:27.962 --> 00:29.795
your best friend
while you're in New York?

00:29.797 --> 00:32.231
Alejandro.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.772
[Karen] You sure are on
the phone a lot in your room

00:39.774 --> 00:42.041
whispering, giggling.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.044
Is there anyone special
in your life right now?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.345
It's none of your business.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.915
Okay, I met somebody.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.117
I'mma introduce her
when I feel the time's right.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.153
Pretty dang soon

00:54.155 --> 00:56.989
it's going to become
all of my business.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.362

01:08.001 --> 01:09.401

01:11.738 --> 01:13.238

01:14.174 --> 01:16.041
[speaking in Spanish]

01:35.728 --> 01:37.062
[honking]

01:41.734 --> 01:43.836
- Hi.
- Hey, there. How are you?

01:43.838 --> 01:46.738
I'm just fabulous.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.906
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.408
[Karen] Well, that's great.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.813
<i>[Karen] Today, Chantel
is picking me up</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:58.283
<i>to drive me
to a doctor's appointment.</i>

02:00.920 --> 02:06.125
The last time
that I drove consistently

02:06.127 --> 02:10.062
was in the late '80s.

02:10.930 --> 02:11.930
Where am I going?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.632
You're going to the light,
then turning right.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.635
- Well, why don't you tell me--
- You're gonna turn...

02:16.637 --> 02:18.003
You're in the lane.
Just turn right. Just turn it.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.938
- Turn right here?
- No, damn it.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.408
This is the turning lane
right there.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.377
Turn. Right here.
This is the turning lane.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.547
[Karen]
<i>I don't choose to drive.</i>

02:28.549 --> 02:30.682
<i>I have plenty of cars around me</i>

02:30.684 --> 02:32.551
and I have plenty of people
to drive them.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.920
<i>So I could get
where I want to go.</i>

02:34.922 --> 02:38.924
I could always get there, I end
up anywhere and everywhere.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.060
Anywhere I want to be, I am.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.864
[Chantel] So I met with Winter.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.933
We talked about Jah

02:47.935 --> 02:52.004
and what went down
at my graduation party.

02:52.006 --> 02:55.407
And Winter thinks that Jah's
gonna propose to her soon.

02:55.409 --> 03:00.812
So I was telling her just because
you have history with somebody

03:00.814 --> 03:02.781
doesn't mean that
you need to marry them.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.383
It really doesn't.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.051
[Chantel] And then also
look at the history

03:06.053 --> 03:09.755
and make a logical decision
with your brain.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.691
Right.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.394
Winter told me that Jah
proposed to her years ago.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.895
That's very jacked up.

03:16.897 --> 03:17.963
And she declined.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.031
Good.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.999
But that being said,

03:21.001 --> 03:23.535
he wasn't going to tell Winter

03:23.537 --> 03:25.904
that he had a son
before he proposed

03:25.906 --> 03:27.940
because he already proposed
without telling her

03:27.942 --> 03:29.641
in the first place once.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.543
I'm glad that didn't
happen to Winter.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.046
- It almost did.
- It almost did.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.849
I do not even know whether to
really believe

03:37.851 --> 03:41.019
that a proposal is coming soon

03:41.021 --> 03:45.757
because how can you trust
that he'll do anything

03:45.759 --> 03:47.559
that he says he's gonna do, one.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.628
- Yeah.
- And then, two,

03:49.630 --> 03:53.332
how can you believe him
that he was going to tell you.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.967
I don't think he was
going to tell her.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.702
- I think he was gonna...
- When he said that

03:56.704 --> 03:59.104
after he was caught.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.772
After he was caught.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.174
Man.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.744
Well, I told her
if it were me...

04:05.746 --> 04:07.312
Well, first of all,
it wouldn't be me

04:07.314 --> 04:08.847
'cause I don't put up
with all that bull.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.851
But I told her maybe she and
Jah should go into counseling.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.621
Counseling right now would--

04:15.623 --> 04:18.023
- Sorry.
- I guess, Jah...

04:18.025 --> 04:22.694

Seven years, and now you're

04:36.744 --> 04:38.777
You've already been married,
oh, my God.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.713
They are dealing
with each other right now,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.782
so they need counseling
right now.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.918
They have so many issues
with one another.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.988
Do you think it's gonna get
better once you get married?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.824
I really believe he needs
to grow up.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.595
He needs to learn
how to listen and things.

04:56.597 --> 05:01.400
I think that before
you go into matrimony,

05:01.402 --> 05:04.770
you should've already
ironed out all the kinks,

05:04.772 --> 05:08.940
<i>not gathered up in a heap and
taken with you down the aisle.</i>

05:08.942 --> 05:11.777

walking down the aisle

05:11.779 --> 05:14.813

05:14.815 --> 05:17.582
Yeah, Winter can't really
trust Jah.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.818
He's got a few issues.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.420
I just have to give her
a phone call.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.422
I need to know what's going on.

Now this would be easier if I knew

05:45.846 --> 05:48.347
So I have met someone,
a woman named Megan...

06:08.736 --> 06:11.570
And, I mean, hey, she
looks good in a bathing suit.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.772
I don't complain.

06:13.774 --> 06:18.009
<i>♪ She got that body

06:25.017 --> 06:26.718
I never got this deep
with a female.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.087
<i>Usually, it's just
quick flings, you know,</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:30.822

to like Megan.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.790

06:31.792 --> 06:34.326

I hope she feel the same.

<i>We met through mutual friends

06:39.733 --> 06:41.533
conversation was
just so easy with her.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.934
And that's something I like.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.736
Like, she had
a lot of personality.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.538
Uh, she's funny.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.007
<i>I've been talking to her
for a couple of months.</i>

06:49.009 --> 06:50.776
<i>I always got to call her
on the video chat.</i>

06:50.778 --> 06:53.678
When I talk, she listen,
and when she talk, I listen.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.947
It was just, I could talk
to her about anything.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.416
And that's very refreshing.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.389
<i>Megan is 28 years old.</i>

07:04.391 --> 07:05.724
I'm 23 years old.

<i>I don't think the age difference
is too much, you know,</i>

07:10.063 --> 07:14.166
'cause my brother, he's
32 and Angenette's 25.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.734
So that's seven years.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.270

<i>Megan lives in Savannah,

07:26.846 --> 07:28.613
We hung out in group settings.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.981
So I'm really glad that today

07:29.983 --> 07:30.682
we could have some
one-on-one time,

07:30.684 --> 07:31.783
just me and her.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.422

a dream come true right now.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.936
- Hi.
- Hey, what's going on?

07:51.871 --> 07:53.238
Shopping's so bad.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.106
[River speaking]

07:55.108 --> 07:57.042
[Megan] Thank you, so do you.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.845
- I'm just looking at you...
- [Megan laughs]

07:59.847 --> 08:01.780
My name is Megan, I'm 28,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.515

near Savannah, Georgia,

08:03.517 --> 08:05.617

from Kentucky.</i>

[Megan] I think we have
to wear our mask, right?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.688
[River] Yeah, we got
to wear the mask.

dating, getting to know each other.</i>

it's gonna go right now.

she eventually just told me,

like, "Okay, River,
I do have a son."

considered an acquaintance.</i>

08:54.801 --> 08:56.768

<i>But, no, like...</i>

08:57.971 --> 09:00.672
Here I am, months later.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.908
<i>I haven't met Megan's son yet.</i>

09:02.910 --> 09:04.342

want to rush anything.

don't know I'm freaking out.</i>

But I'm freaking out,
I'm not gonna go

09:22.729 --> 09:27.032
into this little
cylinder of hell.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.611
River was so cute, like, I knew
he was a little bit apprehensive.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.982
I feel like he really was
able to let loose.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.917
I'm trying not to scream too
loud, so I'm doing one of these...

09:52.358 --> 09:54.726
<i>Megan is really graceful,</i>

09:54.728 --> 09:57.262

for some spacesuits or something.

Oh, I'm not the only one

Wait, I'm-- Is it crazy?
It look crazy?

10:21.755 --> 10:24.656
It was fun, like, watching your facial
expression when you first went up.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.391
I thought... [laughing]

10:26.393 --> 10:28.994
- I was like, I know he is...
- What was I doing?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.762
Your face was like...

10:30.764 --> 10:32.764
- No, no.
- I promise.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.866
It was like you were excited

10:34.868 --> 10:38.303
but you were like not sure
about it at the same time.

10:39.839 --> 10:40.739
All right, I'm gonna sit down.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.941
Oh, yeah.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.976
- I feel kind of weird.
- I got noodle legs.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.545
I don't know, maybe it'll get
better the next time we do it.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.713
No, we definitely
got to come back.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.915
Next time you're out here,
we gotta do it.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.118
I know. It was so fun.
I can't wait to do it again.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.854
- I had a good time.
- Yeah.

10:55.888 --> 10:59.224
So you had mentioned

10:59.226 --> 11:01.793
wanting to talk
to your family about me.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.794
Yeah.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.062
Are you still kinda feeling

11:04.064 --> 11:06.164
like that's what you wanna do?

11:07.633 --> 11:09.801
They've definitely been asking

11:09.803 --> 11:12.637
because I've been like on the
phone a lot, like we talk all the time.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.406
I've kinda been blowing it off
just because, like,

11:14.408 --> 11:15.807
I know we're taking things slow

11:15.809 --> 11:18.143
and I don't want to rush
anything, you know.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.613
And I never really brought
anybody home to meet my family.

11:21.615 --> 11:24.015
- Ever?
- Mmm-mmm.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.418
How do you think
they're gonna react?

11:26.420 --> 11:28.620
Me being older
and having a child.

11:28.622 --> 11:32.123
Like, I know me as a mom,
if my son

11:32.125 --> 11:34.759
brought home an older woman
that had a child,

11:34.761 --> 11:37.395
I would probably have
a lot of questions.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.699
Yeah. They would definitely
have a lot of questions,

11:40.701 --> 11:42.467
but we're an open arm family.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.603
You know, we try to embrace
anybody who comes.

11:45.605 --> 11:49.574
<i>You know, I kinda don't wanna
just throw Megan into the fire.</i>

11:49.576 --> 11:53.712
My family could be a little bit
overwhelming at times, you know.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.781
So I'mma introduce her
when I feel the time's right.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.850
[Megan] When am I
gonna see you again?

11:58.852 --> 12:02.153
When do you wanna see me? I wanna
see you later, tomorrow, whenever.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.755
[Megan laughs] All the time?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.290
Hell, yeah.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.427
- All right.
- All right.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.998
No, we didn't kiss goodbye.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.974
I think I want him
to move at whatever pace

12:22.976 --> 12:25.009
he feels like
is comfortable for him.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.912
I'm not trying to rush him
into a kiss

12:27.914 --> 12:31.316
or, you know,
anything else for that matter.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.054
Megan and I haven't kissed yet.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.993
No, definitely not. Definitely
not playing hard to get.

12:43.395 --> 12:46.331
Sometimes you gotta let the
girls come to you, you know.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.137
Oh, Lord, we need to end this.

12:57.743 --> 13:01.079
If Pedro could get some answers

13:01.081 --> 13:05.183
about his dad, he can have
some closure to it.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.821

17:49.735 --> 17:52.336
No. I'm just helping you
get ready to go.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.408
I'm not happy. I mean, I
was just trying to help you.

18:06.952 --> 18:07.585
You get that.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.053
Okay, I get that.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.955
- You got your mask? Good.
- Yeah, I got my mask, baby.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.381
Right.

18:55.400 --> 19:00.271
I know that you didn't have a relationship
with your dad, since you were about what,

19:00.273 --> 19:01.339
ten?

19:03.909 --> 19:08.246
But, he was with you
during the early years, right?

19:09.414 --> 19:14.218
Like, he was sort of in and out of
your life for the beginning of your life--

19:17.489 --> 19:22.260
While we were dating, Pedro did tell
me about his dad and how he was around

19:22.262 --> 19:27.131
in some capacity, and then,
just poof! Disappeared.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.469
<i>And he never heard from him
again, which I thought was very sad.</i>

19:31.471 --> 19:36.307
And it pains him
to not have those answers.

19:53.058 --> 19:57.161
Okay, like to maybe be
with your mom in the night.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.823
So, he was sneaking in and out
of your house at night.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.993
I'm just so curious, I
wanna put the pieces together.

20:32.931 --> 20:38.536
So, then why do you want to find your father,
if you don't want to acknowledge, like,

20:38.538 --> 20:40.438
the parts that he...

20:40.440 --> 20:43.841
was in your life-- I don't
know. I just find it all so strange

20:43.843 --> 20:48.379
because I've never experienced something
like that, so I want to know more about it.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.617
I'm a little afraid, baby.
I'm scared for you

20:52.619 --> 20:56.020
because I know that you
have a lot of pain with this.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.156
You don't want to talk about it?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.061
Okay.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.396
You don't have to talk about it.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.901
You look so gorgeous tonight.

21:10.903 --> 21:11.969
Thank you, babe.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.006
She thinks that we're going on
an average date night,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.975
but I'm planning on
proposing to her tonight.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.134
We really needed
a good date night.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.103
Right. Especially somewhere
we haven't been before.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.273
Yeah. I just wanna be
with you. So.

21:51.743 --> 21:55.079
That's what makes
it good. For me.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.516
After bringing Jah to
my sister's graduation party,

21:58.518 --> 22:01.886
and talk about
negative things in the past...

22:01.888 --> 22:06.424
I feel like sometimes they
can't let me move forward.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.592
<i>And I'm constantly having
to look back.</i>

22:08.594 --> 22:10.861
<i>[Jah] Then you constantly
gotta defend yourself.</i>

22:10.863 --> 22:14.165
Right. I don't wanna feel like I
have to defend myself all the time.

22:14.167 --> 22:20.004
I find Winter's family involvement
in our relationship to be very toxic.

22:20.006 --> 22:24.408
I think that I need to develop healthier
boundaries with my sister and my family.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.576
[Jah] Totally agree.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.212
They kind of overstep
their bounds...

22:28.214 --> 22:29.780
when it comes to
other people's relationships.

22:29.782 --> 22:35.886
My sister... last time I talked to her,
she was just, like, hounding me about you,

22:35.888 --> 22:40.558
talking about drama that I wanna
leave in the past because we're over it.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.425
Right.

22:41.427 --> 22:42.526
[Winter] We've had
a chance to move on.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.930
You know, we're walking
into newness.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.800
Walk into newness, we're
still young, we will enjoy our life.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.035
[Winter] Right.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.437
With or without your family.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.809
Yeah, let's not even
talk about them.

22:58.811 --> 23:02.747
After the ambush, me and Jah
took about a year for us to,

23:02.749 --> 23:05.816
you know, spend some time apart.

23:05.818 --> 23:10.554
But, me and Jah have made a
promise to be honest with each other.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.257
About everything,
even when it's hard.

23:13.259 --> 23:17.294
So, I'm loving
this new relationship.

23:17.296 --> 23:21.932
[Jah] So, now we're starting, you
know, a new chapter in our book.

23:21.934 --> 23:25.636
No more drama, no more secrets,

23:25.638 --> 23:28.639
no more lies,
you know know, just,

23:28.641 --> 23:30.674
complete honesty and trust.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.343
I just want you to be happy.

23:32.811 --> 23:35.212
So I'll make you happy.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.848
- I love you.
- I love you too.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.250
Oh, my gosh!

23:40.652 --> 23:43.554
She thinks that we're going on
an average date night

23:43.556 --> 23:47.925
to have a good time,
let loose, just unwind, but

23:47.927 --> 23:50.428
I'm planning on
proposing to her tonight.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.231
Aww! Thank you babe.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.902
We did a lot of talking
and communicating,

23:57.904 --> 23:59.804
you know, just getting those
issues out of the way.

23:59.806 --> 24:04.341
<i>So, I think she's accepted me
and accepted my situation.</i>

24:06.011 --> 24:08.012
So this is the ring.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.582
It's an agate
with some diamonds in it.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.918
When I saw this ring,
I thought of Winter

24:13.920 --> 24:19.089
'cause she's not into the
traditional type of engagement ring.

24:20.926 --> 24:21.926
You look so gorgeous tonight.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.161
Thank you, babe.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.997
I see you changed the color
of your braces too.

24:26.999 --> 24:27.932
I did.

24:27.934 --> 24:31.936
Your smile looks definitely
more enchanting.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.940
[dance music playing]

24:35.942 --> 24:37.408
Do you want to dance?

24:37.410 --> 24:39.009
Yeah, let's dance.

24:43.715 --> 24:47.651
<i>[Jah] I've always
found Winter attractive,</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:50.120
<i>her appearance and her mindset.</i>

24:50.122 --> 24:52.957
And I've always been attracted

24:54.893 --> 24:58.796
I think they're hot.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.297
[Winter laughs]

25:00.665 --> 25:02.399
Oh my gosh!

25:10.609 --> 25:13.110
I'm so happy that
we're here together,

25:13.112 --> 25:16.714
and I'm happy that we're just
getting this opportunity.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.015
I'm ready to start anew.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.751
I'm ready to move forward
and move on.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.820
We have to build
on further ground

25:22.822 --> 25:25.022
so we have to pull up
that old soil,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.691
re-plant it, start over

25:27.693 --> 25:29.093
and build a foundation.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.694
I love you. [chuckles]

25:30.696 --> 25:32.396
I love you too, babe.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.634
[Winter] But I'll be honest.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.703
There are still some days
where I, you know,

25:39.705 --> 25:43.140
I still think about what
happened in the past.

25:44.809 --> 25:48.979
A lot of times when
Chantel speaks to me...

25:49.548 --> 25:50.681
she's very critical.

25:50.815 --> 25:55.753
He proposed to you before
he told you he had a son.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.922
So he could have never told you.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.590
He could be lying

25:59.592 --> 26:02.226
that he was about to tell you,
I mean--

26:03.762 --> 26:06.931
I don't appreciate having
critical conversations

26:06.933 --> 26:09.166
every time I see her.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.601
<i>But the truth of the matter is</i>

26:10.603 --> 26:14.872
Chantel brought a different
perspective to me when I spoke to her.

26:14.874 --> 26:19.577
I wasn't really-- I mean I
didn't think about it in that way.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.845
If I didn't find out
the way I did

26:21.847 --> 26:24.248
about your other child,
would you have ever told me?

26:24.816 --> 26:26.417
I was gonna tell you.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.351
You were gonna tell me?

26:27.353 --> 26:29.853
I was gonna tell you before,

26:29.855 --> 26:36.026
before I proposed to you or anything
went further, I was going to tell you.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.965
So, my thing is,
I remember once before,

26:40.967 --> 26:44.101
you did propose to me,
you asked me to marry you.

26:44.636 --> 26:49.106
I'm wondering if you
would have ever told me.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.443
You mean to say, I've
proposed to you before?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.979
Yes.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.183
I don't remember
proposing to you before.

27:01.519 --> 27:02.987
[Winter] Why are you
acting like that now?

27:02.989 --> 27:06.056
Now I'm gonna like,
take my hand back.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.828
[Jah] I think
it wasn't traditional.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.363
It wasn't traditional, I know.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.799
You didn't get down on
one knee, I know,

27:15.801 --> 27:18.969
but you did
get me a ring, though.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.940
Well, now that makes me
feel like

27:22.942 --> 27:25.042
everything that you've been
saying is a lie.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.414
So now, if I cannot trust
what happened back then

27:30.416 --> 27:33.183
then I cannot trust now. So.

27:33.551 --> 27:35.419
That's it.

27:36.955 --> 27:41.525
I mentioned something and
he's telling me that it didn't happen

27:41.527 --> 27:44.862
when I obviously experienced it.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.698
It's like "Here is the man
that I've been with forever

27:47.700 --> 27:51.402
and I've just been trying
so hard to make it work."

27:51.404 --> 27:57.174
And at this moment I'm not
sure if I could even trust Jah.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.579
Everything's fine with you.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.982
Okay, I missed the good Jah.
Then fine.

28:04.984 --> 28:09.219
Fine. You said some
nice sweet words. It's fine.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.356
Yeah, uh-huh, everything's fine.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.224
Okay.

- Okay.
- Get off me.

[both speaking Spanish]

40:17.615 --> 40:20.316
[laughing]

41:11.402 --> 41:13.970
You're fighting because
someone says, "Your mama."

41:13.972 --> 41:16.105
I don't know
if you were raised right.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.442
[River] Ma, are you ready?

41:19.444 --> 41:20.877
[Karen] Yes, we're ready.

41:20.879 --> 41:25.248
My ancestors might have
been slaves in South Carolina,

41:25.250 --> 41:29.085
so, I'm taking my family
on a road trip to find out.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.620
Hey, wassup?

41:30.622 --> 41:34.090
So, is Jah coming with us?

41:34.092 --> 41:36.292
Of course Jah's coming with me.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.413
[scoffs]

41:57.415 --> 42:00.750
We follow a biblical diet.

42:00.752 --> 42:04.854
I don't believe that God's gonna
send you to hell for eating a shrimp.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.789
So, Jah adopted
this new religion.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.825
And convinced Winter to follow.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.995
You eat a bottom feeder,
you think like a bottom feeder.

42:11.997 --> 42:15.198
Who you saying thinks
like a bottom feeder?

42:15.200 --> 42:18.001
Wait a minute.
Wait just a damn minute.
