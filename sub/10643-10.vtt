{\an1}Yanic and I head to the bar.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.260
{\an1}So, we're walking passed my van

00:52.343 --> 00:54.846
{\an1}and I hear a noise.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.932
{\an1}I had a tambourine in my van, I

00:58.016 --> 01:00.059
{\an1}know, 'cause I was traveling a

01:00.143 --> 01:00.935
{\an1}lot these days.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.103
{\an1}So, I had this whole little

01:02.187 --> 01:03.605
{\an1}musical set up in my van.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.357
{\an1}So I heard this tambourine noise

01:06.441 --> 01:08.860
{\an1}and I see this big bold man

01:08.943 --> 01:09.861
{\an1}in my van.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.279
{\an1}You're in my [bleep] van!

01:11.362 --> 01:13.281
{\an1}And he starts freaking out

01:13.364 --> 01:14.824
{\an1}just trying to escape.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.992
{\an1}"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

01:16.075 --> 01:16.701
{\an1}I'm homeless.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.702
{\an1}I was cold, you know,

01:17.786 --> 01:18.828
{\an1}please have sympathy

01:18.912 --> 01:20.038
{\an1}for a homeless man."

01:20.121 --> 01:21.206
{\an1}At this point Yanic's looking

01:21.289 --> 01:22.248
{\an1}through the van and everything

01:22.332 --> 01:23.541
{\an1}looks to be in place.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.417
{\an1}Get out of here, we're not

01:24.501 --> 01:25.668

{\an1}"Thank you, man, thank you."

01:27.253 --> 01:28.546
{\an1}And he just takes off.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.839
{\an1}My mind's back on the night.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.257
{\an1}You know, so Yanic and I head to

01:31.341 --> 01:32.050
{\an1}the bar.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.009
{\an1}I was actually particularly

01:33.092 --> 01:33.927
{\an1}excited because there was this

01:34.010 --> 01:35.261
{\an1}girl I liked named Vanessa, just

01:35.345 --> 01:36.763
{\an1}beautiful.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.223
{\an1}And I'm a big lip person, she

01:38.306 --> 01:39.641
{\an1}just had the greatest lips.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.725
{\an1}And if all went according to

01:40.809 --> 01:42.352
{\an1}plan I was going to be taking

01:42.435 --> 01:44.229
{\an1}her home that night.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.190
{\an1}In short, the night does not go

01:47.273 --> 01:48.733
{\an1}as planned.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.360
{\an1}I wake up the next morning and I

01:50.443 --> 01:51.861
{\an1}immediately get this gut

01:51.945 --> 01:54.197
{\an1}feeling, so I jump out of bed,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.157
{\an1}get to my van, and this bag that

01:56.241 --> 01:58.952
{\an1}was in my van was gone.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.245
{\an1}There was something that was in

02:00.328 --> 02:01.621
{\an1}there that was really important

02:01.704 --> 02:02.539
{\an1}to me.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.874
{\an1}This was a handmade custom knife

02:04.958 --> 02:06.793
{\an1}that I blacksmithed over several

02:06.876 --> 02:09.294
{\an1}months.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.839
{\an1}It was beautiful, I loved that

02:10.922 --> 02:12.298
{\an1}knife.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.175
{\an1}I am just so livid that this guy

02:14.259 --> 02:16.386
{\an1}had [bleep] me over.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.972
{\an1}No, no, no, not happening.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.473
{\an1}I'm going to find this guy.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.766
{\an1}I'm going to search every

02:21.850 --> 02:23.351
{\an1}street, every homeless shelter,

02:23.434 --> 02:26.521
{\an1}every alley until I find him,

02:26.604 --> 02:28.481
{\an1}but I needed a wardrobe change.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.650
{\an1}I needed to dress the part.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.694
{\an1}Ripped jeans, tattered hoodie,

02:32.777 --> 02:34.153
{\an1}Converse with paint covered all

02:34.237 --> 02:35.780
{\an1}over them, orange beanie.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.781
{\an1}I looked at myself in the

02:36.865 --> 02:38.408
{\an1}mirror, this is it.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.576
{\an1}This is what it's gonna take to

02:39.659 --> 02:41.327
{\an1}find this guy.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.787
{\an1}So the next five days I hit the

02:42.871 --> 02:43.830
{\an1}streets.

02:43.913 --> 02:44.914
{\an1}I'm going over to people

02:44.998 --> 02:45.915
{\an1}limping.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.418
{\an1}Yo, man, y-y-you see a bald

02:48.501 --> 02:49.419
{\an1}headed guy.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.295
{\an1}"Don't know him."

02:50.378 --> 02:52.088
{\an1}Yay tall, yo big.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.506
{\an1}"No, no, man."

02:53.590 --> 02:55.008
{\an1}He's got like a Spock tattoo

02:55.091 --> 02:55.925
{\an1}coming up the next.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.676
{\an1}"You got a beer I can have,

02:56.759 --> 02:57.635
{\an1}man?"

02:57.719 --> 02:59.429
{\an1}Five days goes by and nothing's

02:59.512 --> 03:00.179
{\an1}come up.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.098
{\an1}I haven't found him.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.182
{\an1}There's this one homeless

03:03.266 --> 03:04.601
{\an1}shelter that I wanted to check

03:04.684 --> 03:06.144
{\an1}out and I'm just looking around,

03:06.227 --> 03:07.937
{\an1}looking around, and I literally

03:08.021 --> 03:10.315
{\an1}have to shake my eyes.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.774
{\an1}I see him, my heart just starts

03:11.858 --> 03:12.817
{\an1}pounding.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.235
{\an1}I didn't plan really what I was

03:14.319 --> 03:15.737
{\an1}going to do when I found him so

03:15.820 --> 03:18.281
{\an1}I cover my face and I get on the

03:18.364 --> 03:19.324
{\an1}phone with the cops.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.199
{\an1}They tell me they're sending a

03:20.283 --> 03:22.035
{\an1}car right down, but I see him

03:22.118 --> 03:23.536
{\an1}coming out-oh [bleep].

03:23.620 --> 03:24.913
{\an1}And he leaves so I start

03:24.996 --> 03:26.873
{\an1}following this guy for several

03:26.956 --> 03:28.124
{\an1}blocks and then I realize that

03:28.207 --> 03:30.001
{\an1}he sees me and he starts walking

03:30.084 --> 03:32.545
{\an1}towards me.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.421
{\an1}"Yo man, you need anything,

03:33.504 --> 03:34.464
{\an1}man?"

03:34.547 --> 03:36.007
{\an1}No, man, I don't need anything,

03:36.090 --> 03:37.383
{\an1}but thanks though, thanks.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.302
{\an1}The next thing you know just

03:39.385 --> 03:41.471
{\an1}race past me, they pin him off

03:41.554 --> 03:43.306
{\an1}so I run over there and I go,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.308
{\an1}"Remember me, bitch?"

03:45.391 --> 03:46.100
{\an1}That's when he just went

03:46.184 --> 03:48.186
{\an1}wide-eyed and started coming at

03:48.269 --> 03:49.145
{\an1}me and I'm just like, "Oh

03:49.228 --> 03:50.939
{\an1}[bleep]," and then the cops like

03:51.022 --> 03:53.191
{\an1}take him down and take him away.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.734
{\an1}And about an hour later I get a

03:54.817 --> 03:57.278
{\an1}call from the cops thanking me.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.072
{\an1}This guy was apparently wanted

03:59.155 --> 04:00.657
{\an1}for several other crimes.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.699
{\an1}They tell me to come down to the

04:01.783 --> 04:03.826
{\an1}station and the cop comes out

04:03.910 --> 04:04.911
{\an1}and he takes from behind his

04:04.994 --> 04:06.829
{\an1}back and shows me the knife.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.706
{\an1}It's as if he handed me the gold

04:08.790 --> 04:11.542
{\an1}medal and I just lift it to the

04:11.626 --> 04:14.629
{\an1}sky fist pumping my knife, woot,

04:14.712 --> 04:15.421
{\an1}woot!

04:15.505 --> 04:16.839
{\an1}And I just started dancing.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.048
{\an1}He looks at me like clearly they

04:18.132 --> 04:19.466
{\an1}did not know how much this knife

04:19.550 --> 04:20.385
{\an1}meant to me.

{\an1}I'm in full superhero mode.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.429
{\an1}I phone Vanessa, we're going out

04:24.347 --> 04:25.431
{\an1}Yeah, we are.

{\an1}People are buying me drinks.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.687
{\an1}I look over at Vanessa, I just

04:30.770 --> 04:31.771
{\an1}see her wink at me.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.356

05:56.522 --> 05:57.523
{\an1}My twin brother said, "He's

{\an1}girls hopped up on the DJ table.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.404
{\an1}My heart was trembling because I

06:45.488 --> 06:45.988
{\an1}didn't know if I was going to

06:46.072 --> 06:47.740
{\an1}get a ticket, but luckily the

06:47.824 --> 06:49.659
{\an1}officer offered to help us look

06:49.742 --> 06:50.660
{\an1}for the snake.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.578
{\an1}We looked upstairs, downstairs,

06:52.662 --> 06:53.830
{\an1}behind furniture, under

06:53.913 --> 06:54.372
{\an1}furniture, under the girl's

06:54.455 --> 06:57.083
{\an1}dress, the snake was nowhere

06:57.166 --> 06:58.042
{\an1}to be found.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.085
{\an1}Then it dawned on me that

06:59.168 --> 07:00.169
{\an1}we hadn't checked the garage

07:00.253 --> 07:01.212
{\an1}just yet.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.547
{\an1}We went to the garage and mind

07:02.630 --> 07:03.881
{\an1}you, I was scared out of my mind

07:03.965 --> 07:05.007
{\an1}because the garage was

07:05.091 --> 07:06.175
{\an1}poorly lit.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.426
{\an1}I'm pretty sure Nessy was

07:07.510 --> 07:09.679
{\an1}slithering around the floor so

07:09.762 --> 07:11.139
{\an1}I was terrified opening

07:11.222 --> 07:11.681
{\an1}everything, looking behind

07:11.764 --> 07:13.307
{\an1}every box.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.308
{\an1}So the officer walked to the

07:14.392 --> 07:16.185
{\an1}corner of the garage and he felt

07:16.269 --> 07:17.228
{\an1}something moving around his

07:17.311 --> 07:18.604
{\an1}foot.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.981
{\an1}We rushed over to the corner and

07:20.064 --> 07:21.190
{\an1}shined a flashlight.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.859
{\an1}Lo and behold there's Nessy

07:22.942 --> 07:24.986
{\an1}coiled into the water hose as if

07:25.069 --> 07:25.361
{\an1}it was a snake.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.281
{\an1}I gave the officer the biggest

07:28.364 --> 07:30.199
{\an1}hug I could because, let me tell

07:30.283 --> 07:32.201
{\an1}you, I have never been more

07:32.285 --> 07:33.619
{\an1}excited in my life to see a

07:33.703 --> 07:35.329
{\an1}snake than that moment.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.081
{\an1}We got the snake back to Brian.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.000
{\an1}We got Brian home safely, and

07:39.083 --> 07:40.126
{\an1}went out to a strip club to

07:40.209 --> 07:41.210
{\an1}celebrate the rest of our 21st

07:41.294 --> 07:43.171
{\an1}birthday.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.098
{\an1}story about the time when I got

07:54.182 --> 07:56.517
{\an1}to meet my favorite artist in

07:56.601 --> 07:58.895
{\an1}the world, Beyonce.

07:58.978 --> 07:59.520
{\an1}So I'm searching for a job and I

07:59.604 --> 08:02.231
{\an1}come across this posting looking

08:02.315 --> 08:03.649
{\an1}for an assistant to a celebrity

08:03.733 --> 08:05.067
{\an1}fashion stylist, kinda like the

08:05.151 --> 08:06.611
{\an1}Devil Wears Prada, but I didn't

08:06.694 --> 08:08.529
{\an1}know to the extent of how crazy

08:08.613 --> 08:09.322
{\an1}it was going to be.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.823
{\an1}Anything he needed me to do

08:10.907 --> 08:11.782
{\an1}I'm doing.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.034
{\an1}Go pick up all the garments,

08:13.117 --> 08:14.827
{\an1}steam all the garments, help him

08:14.911 --> 08:15.953
{\an1}get dressed and tie

08:16.037 --> 08:16.871
{\an1}his shoestrings.

08:16.954 --> 08:17.830
{\an1}He would have me try on

08:17.914 --> 08:19.040
{\an1}female clothing.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.251
{\an1}He also has spies spy on me.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.502
{\an1}One thing he tells me, "We're

08:23.586 --> 08:24.795
{\an1}about to have a big shoot."

08:24.879 --> 08:26.130
{\an1}I end up finding out that it's

08:26.214 --> 08:27.215
{\an1}for Beyonce and I'm like,

08:27.298 --> 08:28.299
{\an1}"Oh, Beyonce, yes!"

08:28.382 --> 08:29.759
{\an1}I gotta go and get a really good

08:29.842 --> 08:30.885
{\an1}haircut, look good

08:30.968 --> 08:31.886
{\an1}with the outfit.

08:31.969 --> 08:32.886
{\an1}I got to get myself together.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.179
{\an1}So I'm so freakin' excited,

08:34.263 --> 08:34.804
{\an1}playin' her music the whole time

08:34.889 --> 08:36.640
{\an1}before the shoot.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.975
{\an1}I come to the set and then the

08:38.058 --> 08:39.894
{\an1}stylist is like, "If you even

08:39.977 --> 08:41.729
{\an1}look her way you're going to be

08:41.812 --> 08:42.520
{\an1}fired."

08:42.605 --> 08:43.522
{\an1}And he takes off.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.524
{\an1}That's when a photographer was

08:44.607 --> 08:45.816
{\an1}like, "Put those garments down.

08:45.900 --> 08:46.734
{\an1}I need you to come stand in for

08:46.817 --> 08:48.110
{\an1}some shots right away."

08:48.194 --> 08:49.320
{\an1}So I start standing in for some

08:49.403 --> 08:50.821
{\an1}shots and out of nowhere,

08:50.905 --> 08:52.531
{\an1}basically, Beyonce shows up.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.200
{\an1}>> [screams]

08:54.283 --> 08:54.951
{\an1}>> And I'm thinking that I have

08:55.034 --> 08:56.244
{\an1}to move and go back to work and

08:56.327 --> 08:57.245
{\an1}the photographer is like,

08:57.328 --> 08:58.246
{\an1}"Don't move."

08:58.329 --> 08:59.705
{\an1}Beyonce just poses and the

08:59.789 --> 09:00.748
{\an1}photographer starts taking

09:00.831 --> 09:02.250
{\an1}photos of us and I'm thinking to

09:02.333 --> 09:03.793
{\an1}myself, "This photographer is

09:03.876 --> 09:05.670
{\an1}going to get me fired."

09:05.753 --> 09:07.004
{\an1}Once the photographer is done

09:07.088 --> 09:07.630
{\an1}Beyonce is like, "What about our

09:07.713 --> 09:09.382
{\an1}close-up shot?

09:09.465 --> 09:09.966
{\an1}This is my little brother."

09:10.049 --> 09:12.051
{\an1}Oh my freakin' goodness.

09:12.134 --> 09:12.969
{\an1}And the photographer is like,

09:13.052 --> 09:14.553
{\an1}"Okay, you guys get close."

09:14.637 --> 09:15.596
{\an1}Yay, I was so freakin' excited.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.223
{\an1}We clutch arms together I look

09:17.306 --> 09:18.224
{\an1}to the side and then the

09:18.307 --> 09:19.100
{\an1}photographer just takes one

09:19.183 --> 09:20.351
{\an1}photo, he's like, "That's it."

09:20.434 --> 09:21.519
{\an1}Beyonce gives me this big hug.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.188
{\an1}"Ahh!"

09:24.272 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}This might be a good job.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.440
{\an1}I might've hit the jackpot and

09:26.524 --> 09:28.025
{\an1}then the stylist tells me,

09:28.109 --> 09:28.859
{\an1}"They're never going to publish

09:28.943 --> 09:29.694
{\an1}those.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.736
{\an1}You know that you just ruined

09:30.820 --> 09:31.904
{\an1}your whole career for doing

09:31.988 --> 09:34.448
{\an1}this."

09:34.532 --> 09:34.991
{\an1}We found out that there was

09:35.074 --> 09:36.617
{\an1}going to be a party.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.910
{\an1}I come in the party we see all

09:37.994 --> 09:39.704
{\an1}these magazines stacked up and I

09:39.787 --> 09:41.163
{\an1}pick up one and I see our photo

09:41.247 --> 09:42.665
{\an1}and I'm in the magazine,

09:42.748 --> 09:43.708
{\an1}jackpot!

09:43.791 --> 09:45.084
{\an1}So here I am grabbing like 20 of

09:45.167 --> 09:46.294
{\an1}them just so I can have one for

09:46.377 --> 09:48.087
{\an1}grandmother, for my mom, for my

09:48.170 --> 09:50.131
{\an1}brother and then Beyonce shows

09:50.214 --> 09:51.924
{\an1}up and Single Ladies comes on

09:52.008 --> 09:53.175
{\an1}and I started doing the whole

09:53.259 --> 09:55.886
{\an1}dance like, "Uh, uh, oh, uh, uh,

09:55.970 --> 09:56.053
{\an1}uh."

09:56.137 --> 09:56.554
{\an1}She's smiling like she's

09:56.637 --> 09:59.223
{\an1}partying with me like, "Hey,"

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
{\an1}she gives me another hug and

10:00.474 --> 10:01.350
{\an1}she's like, "You know you're a

10:01.434 --> 10:02.852
{\an1}star, right?"

10:02.935 --> 10:03.853
{\an1}That's when the stylist guy

10:03.936 --> 10:05.104
{\an1}fired me.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.230
{\an1}He was like, "You're trying to

10:06.314 --> 10:08.232
{\an1}be famous now after I told you

10:08.316 --> 10:09.650
{\an1}never to talk to people," but I

10:09.734 --> 10:11.027
{\an1}didn't care.

10:11.110 --> 10:11.944
{\an1}I was just like, "Thank you,

10:12.028 --> 10:13.779
{\an1}Beyonce for believing in me and

10:13.863 --> 10:16.741
{\an1}I'm still your little brother."

{\an1}"Well, why don't we just leave?"

11:46.205 --> 11:47.415

11:47.498 --> 11:48.457
{\an1}because she got up and walked

11:48.541 --> 11:50.626
{\an1}away like smooth criminal and

11:50.709 --> 11:53.421
{\an1}somehow I completely lose

11:53.504 --> 11:54.713
{\an1}control of my legs and stand up

11:54.797 --> 11:57.007
{\an1}and follow her out.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.509
{\an1}And it was the longest walk of

11:58.592 --> 12:00.469
{\an1}my life, I was so afraid.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.303
{\an1}We get outside.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.471
{\an1}Every time she looks away from

12:02.555 --> 12:03.848
{\an1}me I'm trying to flag down the

12:03.931 --> 12:05.266

{\an1}peachy keen just, "Yeah, no the

12:09.353 --> 12:09.812
{\an1}drink actually wasn't bad."

12:09.895 --> 12:10.813
{\an1}We get in her car and she gives

12:10.896 --> 12:12.606
{\an1}me a ride back to where

12:12.690 --> 12:13.482
{\an1}I'm parked."

12:13.566 --> 12:14.442
{\an1}We pull up to this spot

12:14.525 --> 12:15.359
{\an1}and this is the part of the date

12:15.443 --> 12:16.360
{\an1}that I'm worst at.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.528
{\an1}You know I don't know whether

12:17.611 --> 12:17.987
{\an1}it's time to make out

12:18.070 --> 12:19.488
{\an1}or get out.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.114
{\an1}She just takes the reins, dives

12:20.197 --> 12:22.575
{\an1}over the console, is straddling

12:22.658 --> 12:23.159
{\an1}me in the passenger seat and

12:23.242 --> 12:26.620
{\an1}we're making out, going at it.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.122
{\an1}The windows are fogging up, the

12:28.205 --> 12:29.498
{\an1}car is rocking, shirts going

12:29.582 --> 12:31.584
{\an1}this way, pants this way, I'm

12:31.667 --> 12:35.379
{\an1}naked and it's about to go down.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.011

12:56.192 --> 12:57.610
{\an1}the seats ass naked, starts the

12:57.693 --> 13:00.446

13:02.031 --> 13:03.657
{\an1}hit the corner, bent around.

{\an1}gone on a date with a gangster

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
{\an1}and so it was my very first

14:28.951 --> 14:30.995
{\an1}All throughout the day like I'm

{\an1}getting texts from my friends

14:32.246 --> 14:32.621
{\an1}like, "Where are you?"

14:32.705 --> 14:34.123
{\an1}"We're supposed to hang out."

14:34.206 --> 14:35.165
{\an1}I'm like, "I'm not going to hang

14:39.795 --> 14:41.380
{\an1}So I pull up to her house and we

{\an1}have, like, this big romantic

{\an1}Everything's going, like,

14:45.884 --> 14:48.637
{\an1}Out of nowhere as I turn

14:48.721 --> 14:49.888
{\an1}and my face dropped.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.517
{\an1}My car has been graffitied

14:53.601 --> 14:53.892
{\an1}all over.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.978

14:57.938 --> 15:00.274

15:01.233 --> 15:02.192
{\an1}It says "[bleep] sneeze" to the

15:04.737 --> 15:06.071
{\an1}I was pissed.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.073
{\an1}Like I was furious.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.533
{\an1}I'm looking all over my car and

15:09.617 --> 15:11.285
{\an1}on the rear view mirror I see

15:11.368 --> 15:14.246
{\an1}one lone "Magz" and I'm like,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.831
{\an1}"Oh my God, the only people I

15:15.914 --> 15:19.501
{\an1}know who call my girlfriend Magz

15:19.585 --> 15:21.253
{\an1}were the popular, mean girls who

15:21.337 --> 15:23.464
{\an1}didn't like her."

15:23.547 --> 15:25.633
{\an1}"You, mother [bleep] bitch

{\an1}This is bull [bleep]!"

15:30.679 --> 15:32.181
{\an1}So I call all of my friends.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.433
{\an1}I'm like, "We're going to war,

15:34.516 --> 15:35.601
{\an1}and finally get those

15:35.684 --> 15:36.727

15:36.810 --> 15:38.354
{\an1}So I floor it right off

15:38.437 --> 15:39.855
{\an1}to my friend John's house.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.775
{\an1}John, Grant, Matt rush

15:42.858 --> 15:43.108
{\an1}into the car.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.735
{\an1}And so I told Matt, "Give me

15:44.818 --> 15:45.361
{\an1}your phone, I'm going to call

15:45.444 --> 15:47.488
{\an1}pretending to be you," and I

15:47.571 --> 15:48.072
{\an1}called one of the girls and I

15:48.155 --> 15:49.823
{\an1}was like, "Hey, did you hear

15:49.907 --> 15:51.241
{\an1}what happened to Miles' car?"

15:51.325 --> 15:52.576
{\an1}And they were like, "No, what

15:52.660 --> 15:53.494
{\an1}are you talking about?

15:53.577 --> 15:54.620
{\an1}We're at Chili's."

15:54.703 --> 15:55.788
{\an1}And I realize, oh my God they

15:55.871 --> 15:56.747
{\an1}just-the restaurant down the

15:56.830 --> 15:56.955
{\an1}road.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.040
{\an1}We hop in the car, we're going

15:58.123 --> 16:01.126
{\an1}80 in a 30, we're serving lane

16:01.210 --> 16:03.087
{\an1}to lane, into oncoming and

16:03.170 --> 16:04.004
{\an1}finally we get to Chili's and I

16:04.088 --> 16:06.840
{\an1}walk in and it's like borderline

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
{\an1}empty and I was like, "Man, this

16:08.425 --> 16:09.343
{\an1}sucks."

16:09.426 --> 16:10.594
{\an1}So I walk outside, there's a

16:10.678 --> 16:12.638
{\an1}coffee cup on the antenna.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.056
{\an1}"Oh my God, that's a time

16:14.139 --> 16:16.141

16:16.225 --> 16:16.975
{\an1}They just bought coffee right

16:17.059 --> 16:19.144
{\an1}before they came to wreck my car

16:19.228 --> 16:21.563
{\an1}and we go straight to the cafe.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.189
{\an1}I go straight up to the counter,

16:22.272 --> 16:23.899
{\an1}"Hey, at any point today has

16:23.982 --> 16:26.235

{\an1}drink?"

16:26.527 --> 16:28.153
{\an1}He's like, "The only white

16:28.237 --> 16:29.780

16:31.115 --> 16:33.492
{\an1}Just a group of guys?

16:33.575 --> 16:35.119
{\an1}That doesn't make any sense, and

16:35.202 --> 16:36.745
{\an1}I think all is lost when

16:36.829 --> 16:38.414
{\an1}suddenly I hear John, he's like,

16:38.497 --> 16:39.832
{\an1}"Miles, check Twitter."

16:39.915 --> 16:41.375
{\an1}And the very first Tweet that I

16:41.458 --> 16:44.378
{\an1}see is it was a picture of my

16:44.461 --> 16:46.088
{\an1}friends and the only caption

16:46.171 --> 16:50.384

{\an1}"You [bleep] my car!"

16:53.262 --> 16:54.555
{\an1}And looking back I realized that

{\an1}>> We were calling around trying

18:13.884 --> 18:15.636
{\an1}to figure out who has a car.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.721
{\an1}We called Jared,

18:17.805 --> 18:20.307
{\an1}and I called Carl.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.475
{\an1}>> Our friend, Stefan, who lived

18:21.558 --> 18:22.518
{\an1}around the way from us had a

18:22.601 --> 18:23.519
{\an1}minivan so--

18:23.602 --> 18:24.186
{\an1}>> KARL P.: Well his mom had a

18:24.269 --> 18:25.687
{\an1}minivan, it's not his.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.731
{\an1}Stefan doesn't have a car.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.357
{\an1}>> So we had to borrow his mom's

18:28.440 --> 18:30.526
{\an1}minivan.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.109
{\an1}>> KARL P.: We go to Coney

18:31.193 --> 18:31.944
{\an1}Island.

18:32.027 --> 18:32.820
{\an1}We ate great.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.362
{\an1}We rode every single ride.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.531
{\an1}>> MO: We paid for everything.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.448
{\an1}We paid for their rides,

18:36.532 --> 18:36.740
{\an1}their food.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.241
{\an1}>> We paid for the gas.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.867
{\an1}>> MARINO: We was trying to be

18:38.951 --> 18:39.910
{\an1}the perfect gentlemen.

18:39.993 --> 18:40.786
{\an1}>> KARL P.: All right so then we

18:40.869 --> 18:41.703
{\an1}was going back to the car,

18:41.787 --> 18:42.746
{\an1}everything was going perfect.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.789
{\an1}We were trying to end this

18:43.872 --> 18:44.414
{\an1}perfect night with a little bit

18:44.498 --> 18:46.500
{\an1}more perfect.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.501
{\an1}>> A little bit of a better

18:47.584 --> 18:48.669
{\an1}perfect night.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.628
{\an1}And we're driving.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.421
{\an1}>> [Karl imitates sirens]

18:51.505 --> 18:52.256
{\an1}>> The boys in blue,

18:52.339 --> 18:54.216
{\an1}the boys in blue.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.885
{\an1}>> This car is reported stolen.

18:56.969 --> 18:57.261
{\an1}>> Stolen?

18:57.344 --> 18:58.220
{\an1}>> Please step out of the car.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.055
{\an1}>> Step out of the car?

19:00.138 --> 19:01.056
{\an1}>> We're not stepping out of

19:01.139 --> 19:02.850
{\an1}the-we didn't do anything.

19:02.933 --> 19:03.892
{\an1}>> Sir, please step out

19:03.976 --> 19:04.935
{\an1}of the car.

19:05.018 --> 19:05.561
{\an1}>> I think the worst thing about

19:05.644 --> 19:07.729
{\an1}it was that the girls got

19:07.813 --> 19:09.648
{\an1}to go home.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.232
{\an1}The worst thing about it was

19:10.315 --> 19:13.443
{\an1}that the girls got to go home.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.403
{\an1}"Excuse me, officer,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.905
{\an1}but I don't know them."

19:16.989 --> 19:17.990
{\an1}>> MO: "We just met them.

19:18.073 --> 19:18.740
{\an1}Can you please just like

19:18.824 --> 19:19.658
{\an1}let us go?"

19:19.741 --> 19:20.158
{\an1}>> The girls really just

19:20.242 --> 19:21.118
{\an1}turned on us.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.954
{\an1}>> We just spent more than $100

19:24.037 --> 19:24.538
{\an1}on these girls and they just

19:24.621 --> 19:26.081
{\an1}threw us under the bus.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.082
{\an1}>> They threw us under the bus,

19:27.165 --> 19:27.708
{\an1}and then they got on the bus and

19:27.791 --> 19:30.419
{\an1}they drove over us.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.378
{\an1}>> Marino is getting frisked.

19:31.461 --> 19:31.587
{\an1}>> Yes.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.921
{\an1}>> KARL P.: Mo is getting

19:33.005 --> 19:33.589
{\an1}arrested.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.757
{\an1}"Please, no!

19:35.841 --> 19:38.552
{\an1}Please, I have a future!

19:38.635 --> 19:39.761
{\an1}I don't even know these guys

19:39.845 --> 19:41.013
{\an1}either, I'm just with the

19:41.096 --> 19:44.057
{\an1}girls."

19:45.100 --> 19:48.562
{\an1}>> The next morning we wake up.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.396
{\an1}Stefan's mom clears up

19:49.479 --> 19:50.522
{\an1}everything.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.857
{\an1}>> What happened, Stef?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.025
{\an1}>> My bad, man.

19:53.108 --> 19:53.901
{\an1}Sorry, guys.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.819
{\an1}Huge misunderstanding.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.570
{\an1}>> Because he didn't tell his

19:56.653 --> 19:57.321
{\an1}mom that we was taking the car

19:57.404 --> 19:59.489
{\an1}so when she came home she just

19:59.573 --> 20:03.410
{\an1}seen her driveway just empty.

20:03.493 --> 20:03.952
{\an1}>> So we tried calling the

20:04.036 --> 20:04.119
{\an1}girls.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.913
{\an1}>> MO: Oh and their phones

20:05.996 --> 20:06.955

20:13.587 --> 20:14.671
{\an1}I'm not going--

20:14.755 --> 20:15.464
{\an1}>> So the moral of the story

20:15.547 --> 20:15.547
{\an1}is be cheap.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.424
{\an7}>> Be cheap, like they'll be

20:17.507 --> 20:17.966
{\an7}happy with a cheeseburger

20:18.050 --> 20:18.800
