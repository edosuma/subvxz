WEBVTT

00:54.959 --> 00:56.959
(THUD, GLASSES RATTLE)
OHH.

00:56.959 --> 00:57.959
(CLINK)

00:57.959 --> 00:59.875
WOULD YOU
EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND?

00:59.875 --> 01:01.542
OF COURSE.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.375
DARLIN', I DON'T
MEAN TO PRY, BUT...

01:04.375 --> 01:05.708
WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME

01:05.708 --> 01:07.417
JUST WHAT THE HELL IT IS
YOU'RE DOING DOWN THERE?

01:07.417 --> 01:09.041
IT DEPENDS. WOULD YOU
MIND TELLING ME

01:09.041 --> 01:10.625
WHAT THAT GIRL'S HAND
IS DOING KNEE-DEEP
ON YOUR LAP?

01:10.625 --> 01:13.125
EXCUSE ME?

01:13.125 --> 01:15.583
YOU HEARD ME. OR PERHAPS
YOU'D LIKE ME TO INVOLVE
THE ENTIRE TABLE,

01:15.583 --> 01:18.291
'CAUSE I'M SURE HER DATE
WOULD AT LEAST BE
MARGINALLY INTERESTED.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.250
OK, GREAT.
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.375
WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY?

01:21.375 --> 01:24.333
PACEY...
I WANT TO GO HOME.
NOW.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.166
I'M TIRED,
I'M CRANKY,

01:26.166 --> 01:27.708
AND I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T READ
THE FINE PRINT

01:27.708 --> 01:28.625
IN OUR LITTLE
RENT-A-DAY CONTRACT,

01:28.625 --> 01:31.166
BUT IT EXPIRES
IN EXACTLY 35 MINUTES,

01:31.166 --> 01:33.083
SO MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
SKIP THE SUBTLETIES AND
GET HER PHONE NUMBER?

01:33.083 --> 01:35.917
OK, SIS. HOLD IT DOWN.
IT'LL BE FINE.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.583
SHE THINKS
I'M YOUR SISTER?!

01:37.583 --> 01:38.458
OH, WILL YOU
LOOK AT THAT?

01:38.458 --> 01:40.583
OH!

01:40.583 --> 01:42.083
DID I NOT MENTION TO YOU

01:42.083 --> 01:44.583
WHAT A WONDERFUL NETWORKING
OPPORTUNITY THIS WAS FOR ME?

01:44.583 --> 01:46.458
YES. THAT'S HOW YOU
SUCKERED ME INTO COMING
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

01:46.458 --> 01:49.542
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'VE NETWORKED,
WE'VE SCHMOOZED,

01:49.542 --> 01:53.417
AND UNLESS
YOU TAKE ME HOME NOW,
AS IN RIGHT NOW,

01:53.417 --> 01:55.083
I THINK LITTLE
MISS THING OVER THERE

01:55.083 --> 01:57.583
ISN'T GOING TO BE
SO INTERESTED WHEN
SHE SEES YOUR SISTER

01:57.583 --> 02:00.208
LEAN OVER THE TABLE
AND GIVE YOU THE TONGUE
KISSING OF YOUR LIFE.

02:00.208 --> 02:04.041
5 MINUTES.
WE'LL LEAVE IN 5 MINUTES.

02:04.041 --> 02:04.417
THANK YOU.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.500
GREAT. WELL,
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
FINE DOWN THERE.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.834
(CHUCKLES)
SISTERS. YOU KNOW?

02:10.834 --> 02:12.917
YEAH, AND THE GUY I'M WITH
IS REALLY MY BROTHER.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.625
(CHUCKLES)
HE IS?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.125
NO.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.208
(CHUCKLES)
OH. RIGHT.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.250
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.875
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.125
SO THEN YOU WOULDN'T
MIND IF I CALLED YOU?

02:27.125 --> 02:29.542
SURE. YOU COULD CALL ME,
I COULD CALL YOU,

02:29.542 --> 02:33.208
OR I COULD DITCH MY DATE,
AND YOU COULD DITCH
YOUR...SISTER.

02:33.208 --> 02:37.083
(CHUCKLES)
AND WE COULD MEET
BACK HERE IN AN HOUR
AND GO TO MY PLACE.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.041
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS,

02:41.041 --> 02:42.417
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
REALLY WITH THAT GIRL...

02:42.417 --> 02:43.291
THAT GIRL?

02:43.291 --> 02:45.083
The one that's
under the ta--

02:45.083 --> 02:46.417
OH, THAT  GIRL.
THAT GIRL.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.458
OH...NO. NO, NO, NO.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.000
I AM MOST DEFINITELY
NOT WITH THAT GIRL.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
SO...IT'S A DATE?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.458
YES.

02:53.458 --> 02:54.708
I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE
IN AN HOUR.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.750
(GIGGLES)

03:03.083 --> 03:04.291
FINALLY.
I GOT MY SHOE.

03:04.291 --> 03:06.834
IT WAS ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE TABLE.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.166
WAS IT REALLY? GREAT.
THEN PROBLEM SOLVED,
WHATEVER THE PROBLEM WAS.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.625
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
BE GOING. OK?

03:09.625 --> 03:12.375
WAIT, PACEY.
LET ME GET MY SHOE.
COME ON, CINDERELLA.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.291
(SIGHS)

03:13.291 --> 03:14.667
YOU HAVE A HOT DATE
OR SOMETHING?

03:14.667 --> 03:16.500
NO, BUT
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
DID JUST OFFER

03:16.500 --> 03:18.166
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME,
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.708
YOU'RE SO CUTE
WHEN YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.875
PACE...I JUST HAVE
ONE QUESTION.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.208
SHOOT.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.583
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING
TO MY BUTT RIGHT NOW?

04:18.583 --> 04:20.083
THAT'LL BE
THE SEAT WARMER,

04:20.083 --> 04:22.125
WHICH COMES STANDARD
ON ALL YOUR FINER
GERMAN AUTOMOBILES.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.125
HUH. MY LOWER HALF
THANKS YOU

04:25.125 --> 04:28.208
FOR MOVING SO FAR
UP THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
LADDER.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.542
PACEY, WASN'T THAT TURN
WE JUST SPED PAST

04:29.542 --> 04:32.000
THE WAY OUT OF THESE
GODFORSAKEN SUBURBS?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.750
YES, IT WAS, BUT YOU AND
I ARE GONNA BE MAKIN'
A LITTLE PIT STOP.

04:34.750 --> 04:39.125
PIT STOP? OH, NO.
PERHAPS I DIDN'T
IMPRESS UPON YOU

04:39.125 --> 04:40.417
THE IMPORTANCE
OF ME BEING HOME, IN BED,

04:40.417 --> 04:43.333
AND OUT OF THESE
RIDICULOUS CLOTHES
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.750
I HAVE
AN ENTIRE BOOK TO READ
BEFORE HETSON'S CLASS.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.542
OK, SIMMER DOWN.
THIS IS GONNA DELAY YOU,
LIKE, 2 MINUTES.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.834
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
ANYWAY?

04:55.834 --> 04:57.125
NEED?

04:57.125 --> 04:59.375
YEAH. THE REASON
FOR THE PIT STOP?

04:59.375 --> 05:00.125
THE THING
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING?

05:00.125 --> 05:02.792
UH, LAUNDRY DETERGENT.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.959
LAUNDRY DETERGENT?

05:04.959 --> 05:06.542
YES. LAUNDRY DETERGENT.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.583
PACEY, IN THE ENTIRE TIME
I'VE KNOWN YOU,

05:11.583 --> 05:13.250
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
EVER ONCE DONE LAUNDRY.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.875
UH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO COME WITH ME.
YOU CAN WAIT IN THE CAR.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.500
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
EXPECTING ME
TO WAIT OUT HERE

05:16.500 --> 05:18.834
WHILE YOU'RE TRAIPSING
AROUND THE WORLD'S
LARGEST SUPERSTORE?

05:18.834 --> 05:20.166
RIGHT.
WRONG!

05:20.166 --> 05:22.291
IT'S COLD, IT'S SCARY,
AND IF YOU MUST KNOW,

05:22.291 --> 05:23.500
I HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.959
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM?

05:24.959 --> 05:26.417
2 MINUTES AGO,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO STOP.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.458
DO YOU WANT
TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS,
OR SHALL WE CONTINUE

05:27.458 --> 05:31.208
THE 10-MILE TREK
TO THE FRONT OF THE STORE?

05:33.542 --> 05:36.834
WHY DID WE HAVE TO PARK
SO FAR AWAY, ANYWAY?

05:36.834 --> 05:38.333
I JUST SPENT
2 1/2 MONTHS' SALARY

05:38.333 --> 05:40.166
GETTIN' DAWSON'S HOUSE
SCRAPED OFF HER FRONT END.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.166
YOU THINK I WANT TO LEAVE HER
IN THE HANDS OF THOSE FINE,
UPSTANDING CITIZENS? NOOO.

05:45.792 --> 05:46.250
GREAT.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.166
IT'S CLOSED.

05:48.166 --> 05:51.834
IT CAN'T BE CLOSED.
THERE'S STILL PEOPLE INSIDE.

05:51.834 --> 05:54.500
GOOD NIGHT, NOW,
FOLKS. DRIVE SAFE.

05:54.500 --> 05:54.583
HEY!

05:56.667 --> 05:59.500
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU LAMEBRAINS
DOIN' OUT THERE?!

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
THE MONTE CARLO!

06:01.500 --> 06:03.458
WATCH THE MONTE CARLO!

06:08.542 --> 06:10.375
(YAWNS)

06:14.917 --> 06:15.667
OH. I'M GONNA GO--

06:15.667 --> 06:17.834
I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOIN'.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.708
(SIGHS)

06:31.750 --> 06:34.917
UM...WE'RE GONNA
BE CLOSING SOON?

06:34.917 --> 06:36.959
OK.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.917
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

06:46.875 --> 06:48.959
VERY NICE.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.625
THERE YOU ARE.
COME ON. LET'S--

06:59.625 --> 07:01.417
UH--I--COULD YOU
JUST HOLD ON
FOR ONE SECOND?

07:01.417 --> 07:03.542
NO. I NEED YOU.
NEED ME...FOR WHAT?

07:03.542 --> 07:06.250
YOU CAN'T GO
TO THE TOILET
BY YOURSELF?

07:06.250 --> 07:08.166
YES. THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
WHAT?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.583
OK. C-CAN YOU
JUST WAIT--
NO. I CAN'T.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.875
AND WHY WEREN'T YOU
AT THE LAUNDRY?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.375
OK. LET'S GO.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.500
THANK YOU.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.750
YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK
THE RIGHT WAY.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.834
YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE SO BOSSY.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.458
IS YOUR SENSE
OF ADVENTURE
REALLY SO LACKING

07:24.458 --> 07:26.583
YOU COULD NOT HAVE
USED THIS WASHROOM
UNATTENDED?

07:26.583 --> 07:28.708
PACEY, THE OUTER DOOR
DOESN'T LOCK.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.083
SOMEBODY COULD'VE
WALKED IN AT ANY POINT.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.708
SO?
SO...

07:31.708 --> 07:34.417
STALL-TO-STALL
CHATTING
WITH STRANGE MEN

07:34.417 --> 07:35.792
IN PUBLIC WASHROOMS
ISN'T REALLY

07:35.792 --> 07:37.250
A LIFE EXPERIENCE
I NEED TO HAVE,
THANK YOU.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.208
WHO IS GOING
TO WALK IN?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.625
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.375
AND THE WHOLE STORE'S
GONNA CLOSE
IN 5 MINUTES ANYHOW.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.125
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE STILL HERE.
YELL. YELL. YELL.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.208
HEY!
HEY!

07:51.208 --> 07:54.458
MISTER! MISTER!
HEY!

07:54.458 --> 07:55.834
HEY!
HELLO! HELP!

07:55.834 --> 07:58.166
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
TELL ME THIS ISN'T
HAPPENING.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.417
IT'S OK. HE'S
GONNA SEE THE CAR.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.041
PACEY, WE'RE PARKED
IN, LIKE,
ANOTHER ZIP CODE.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.708
ALL RIGHT, IF WE WANT
TO START POINTING FINGERS,

08:02.708 --> 08:05.583
WE SHOULD PROBABLY POINT THEM
AT THE BLADDER THAT GOT US
INTO THIS SITUATION.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.291
HE'S LEAVING.
I CAN SEE THAT,
THANKS.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.291
LOOK. HE'S GETTING
IN HIS CAR,

08:14.291 --> 08:14.750
AND HE'S LEAVING
US HERE TRAPPED.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.208
(SIGHS)

08:24.917 --> 08:26.125
OK.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.166
LET'S NOT PANIC.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.208
WHO'S PANICKING?

08:29.208 --> 08:31.166
I'M PANICKING, PACEY.
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY

08:31.166 --> 08:32.582
WHERE I WANT
TO BE RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE AN EN--

08:32.582 --> 08:34.166
"I'VE GOT A BOOK
TO READ." I KNOW.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.375
WHEN DON'T YOU
HAVE AN ENTIRE BOOK
TO READ?

08:35.375 --> 08:37.291
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY

08:37.291 --> 08:38.457
MY IDEAL SITUATION,
EITHER.

08:38.457 --> 08:41.000
WELL, LOOK, LET'S NOT SNIPE
AT EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.959
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:46.959 --> 08:48.542
WE NEED TO THINK
LOGICALLY.

08:48.542 --> 08:49.708
RIGHT. WELL...
THIS ONE'S LOCKED.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.208
HEY. HEY, ANY LUCK?

09:04.208 --> 09:05.750
THEY'RE NOT
REAL PHONES.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THEY'RE NOT REAL PHONES?

09:07.750 --> 09:10.041
(ECHOING OVER P.A.)
CLEAN UP ON AISLE 4.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.083
CLEAN UP ON AISLE 4.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.041
(SIGHS)

09:13.041 --> 09:14.041
THEY'RE JUST INTERCOMS.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.208
WE CAN CALL HOUSEWARES,

09:15.208 --> 09:16.625
BUT WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.250
PLEASE TELL ME YOU FOUND
SOME KIND OF A BACK DOOR
OR SOMETHING.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.041
NO. NOT ONE
THAT WE CAN OPEN,
BUT I WAS THINKIN',

09:21.041 --> 09:22.250
THERE'S ALWAYS
YOUR EVER-PRESENT
CELL PHONE.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.333
IN MY PURSE.
GREAT.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.375
IN THE CAR.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.625
HMM.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.834
PAY PHONES!
PAY PHONES!

09:29.834 --> 09:31.917
I THINK THEY'RE--
YEAH.

09:31.917 --> 09:34.625
NO, OFFICER.
NOT...STUCK,
LIKE, IN THE SNOW,

09:34.625 --> 09:36.583
STUCK,
AS IN LOCKED IN.

09:36.583 --> 09:37.750
(SIGHS)

09:37.750 --> 09:38.708
NO. NOBODY'S LIFE
IS IN DANGER.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.583
BUT PLEASE DON'T
PUT ME BACK ON HOLD--

09:42.500 --> 09:43.875
(SIGHS)
OK, FINE.
THAT'S IT.

09:43.875 --> 09:44.458
JUST HANG UP.
WE'LL CALL 911.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.583
WE CAN'T CALL 911.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.000
WHY NOT?
WE'RE STUCK,
AREN'T WE?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.917
PACEY, WE'RE STUCK
IN A GIANT BARNLIKE
STRUCTURE

09:49.917 --> 09:50.959
WITH MASSIVE QUANTITIES
OF FOOD, CLOTHING,

09:50.959 --> 09:53.667
AND ALL THE LATEST
IN HOME VIDEO EQUIPMENT.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.583
HOW DOES THAT QUALIFY
AS AN EMERGENCY?
I MEAN,

09:56.583 --> 09:57.959
ARE WE IN SOME SORT
OF A DANGER I'M UNAWARE OF?

09:57.959 --> 09:59.583
YES. WE'RE IN DANGER
OF GETTING YOU
HOME LATE,

09:59.583 --> 10:01.917
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT,
NOW, CAN WE?

10:01.917 --> 10:03.291
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE?

10:03.291 --> 10:04.041
ABOUT WHAT?

10:04.041 --> 10:06.250
GETTING ME HOME
ON TIME?

10:06.250 --> 10:09.458
SINCE...FOREVER.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
LAX IN YOUR STUDIES.

10:09.458 --> 10:13.041
THERE'S IMPORTANT
HOMEWORK TO BE DONE,
BOOKS TO BE READ.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.208
WHAT BOOK IS IT
YOU'RE READING?

10:14.208 --> 10:15.917
FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.083
FEAR AND LOATHING?

10:17.083 --> 10:19.458
YOU'RE PAYING $35,000
A YEAR TO BE TOLD

10:19.458 --> 10:20.750
TO READ
FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.208
YOU COULD DO THAT
ON YOUR OWN TIME.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.583
I  COULD DO THAT
ON MY OWN TIME.
Shut up.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.208
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
IT'S RINGING.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.458
OK. GOOD.
I'LL HAVE YOU HOME
IN NO TIME.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.959
OR WE'LL ROT HERE.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.750
IT TRANSFERRED ME
TO SOME SORT OF
AUTOMATED RESPONSE SYSTEM.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.792
"PRESS ONE TO FILE
A COMPLAINT ABOUT NOISE.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.291
PRESS 2
FOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS."

10:39.291 --> 10:40.917
HERE. YOU  LISTEN.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.875
CAN I HAVE YOUR COAT?
I'M FREEZING.
IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.750
MY COAT? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR COAT?

10:45.750 --> 10:48.250
MINE JUST LOOKS NICE.
IT WASN'T INTENDED
TO KEEP ANYONE WARM,

10:48.250 --> 10:50.000
ESPECIALLY NOT
SOMEONE WEARING ONLY
A THIN LAYER OF SILK.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.875
OK, FINE. HOLD THIS
FOR A SECOND.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.041
BETTER?

11:04.792 --> 11:06.834
THANK YOU.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.166
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PRESS ZERO,

11:08.166 --> 11:11.291
SEE IF WE CAN GET
A REAL PERSON
BACK ON THE LINE.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.667
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GLOVES, DO YOU?

11:12.667 --> 11:14.917
NO, I DIDN'T BR--HELLO!
YES. LOOK, WE'RE STUCK

11:14.917 --> 11:17.083
IN A GIGANTIC KMART.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.208
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU DID TALK TO US EARLIER.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.208
UH, HELLO? NO,
PLEASE DON'T PUT ME
BACK ON...HOLD.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.625
GOD!

11:28.166 --> 11:29.708
WHAT?

11:29.708 --> 11:31.250
ARE THESE YOURS?

11:33.208 --> 11:35.500
THOSE?

11:35.500 --> 11:38.291
YEAH.
THESE...PROPHYLACTICS
I FOUND IN YOUR POCKET.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.000
(COUGHS)
OH. THOSE. UH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THEY ARE.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.875
BUT, LOOK, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY CONCENTRATE

11:42.875 --> 11:44.125
ON THE MATTER
AT HAND HERE.

11:44.125 --> 11:44.875
THIS IS WHY
WE STOPPED?

11:44.875 --> 11:47.959
PACEY, WE'RE
STUCK IN HERE

11:47.959 --> 11:50.208
BECAUSE YOU HAD
SOME PRESSING NEED
FOR BIRTH CONTROL?

11:50.208 --> 11:52.875
YES. OK? BECAUSE THAT'S
THE KIND OF RESPONSIBLE
GUY I AM.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.041
BUT SEEING AS IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET
OUTTA HERE ANYTIME TOO SOON,

11:55.041 --> 11:57.333
IT'S KIND OF A MOOT POINT,
SO IF--UH, HELLO?

11:57.333 --> 11:58.917
HELLO. HELLO.
YES. HELLO.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.834
OK. NO. NO, THAT'S FINE.
IF YOU COULD JUST
PLEASE MAKE SURE

12:02.834 --> 12:04.250
THAT THEY DO
ACTUALLY CALL US BACK.

12:04.250 --> 12:07.708
THE NUMBER
IS 617-555-0189.
THANKS FOR--

12:10.542 --> 12:13.625
OK. WELL, AT LEAST
NOW WE'RE MAKIN'
PROGRESS.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.708
WHAT? WHAT'S
THE LOOK FOR?

12:16.708 --> 12:19.375
IT'S THAT GIRL
FROM THE PARTY,
RIGHT?

12:19.375 --> 12:21.166
YOU WERE
ON A DATE WITH ME,
AND YOU PICKED UP

12:21.166 --> 12:22.834
SOME OTHER GIRL
WITH QUESTIONABLE
FASHION SENSE,

12:22.834 --> 12:24.708
AND THEN YOU WERE GONNA
GO BACK TO HER PLACE--
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.917
SLOW DOWN.
YOU AND I WERE
NOT ON A DATE.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.625
WHICH IS ONLY
THE FIRST OF MANY THINGS
WRONG WITH THAT SENTENCE.

12:28.625 --> 12:31.375
PACEY, MY ENTIRE NIGHT
IS RUINED.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.583
WELL, MY NIGHT'S
NOT EXACTLY GOING
TO PLAN, EITHER.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.041
RUINED! FOR THE SAKE
OF SOME BOOTY CALL?

12:35.041 --> 12:38.500
OK, LET'S...JUST...
TAKE A LITTLE TIME OUT,
BECAUSE YOU AND I...

12:38.500 --> 12:39.834
WE'RE NOT
ACTUALLY HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.917
OH, WHY? 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SEX WITH ME?

12:41.917 --> 12:44.542
HA! DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SEX WITH ME?

12:44.542 --> 12:46.083
WELL, NO, BUT...

12:46.083 --> 12:48.917
I USUALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SEX
WITH ANYBODY.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.708
THANK YOU FOR
PROVING MY POINT. NOW,
IF WE COULD MOVE ON,

12:50.708 --> 12:52.458
I THINK OUR NIGHT
WILL BE MUCH,
MUCH MORE PLEASANT.

12:52.458 --> 12:55.125
AFTER YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SEX WITH ME.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.041
ALL RIGHT, ONE WOULD THINK
THIS WOULD BE OBVIOUS,

12:58.041 --> 12:59.375
BUT FINE. PERHAPS
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HOW CALM

12:59.375 --> 13:01.750
AND COOL AND
NON-JUDGMENTAL YOU ARE
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

13:01.750 --> 13:05.917
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T APPROVE.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.083
OK? THERE. I SAID IT.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.917
AND I REFUSE
TO SIT HERE AND
PRETEND LIKE THIS

13:08.917 --> 13:11.000
IS ALL JUST FINE,
'CAUSE IT'S RIDICULOUS.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.166
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?
YOU CAN'T HELP IT!

13:14.166 --> 13:15.750
THIS IS WHY
WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT SEX.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.792
IT'S ACTUALLY
THE SECRET TO OUR
ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.083
YOU'VE LOST ME
IN YOUR SEA OF PRONOUNS.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.792
WELL, OK.
WE ARE  FRIENDS.
RIGHT?

13:21.792 --> 13:22.750
YES.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.083
SO WHAT IS THE SECRET

13:24.083 --> 13:25.959
TO OUR LONG-LASTING
AND ANGST-FREE
FRIENDSHIP?

13:25.959 --> 13:28.583
WHAT IS THE ONE THING
THAT KEEPS IT GOING

13:28.583 --> 13:29.959
YEAR AFTER YEAR
AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.750
WE SUCK AT MEETING
NEW PEOPLE.
WRONG.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.834
WE DO NOT,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,

13:33.834 --> 13:37.375
TALK ABOUT SEX.
I MAY BE HAVING IT,

13:37.375 --> 13:39.792
YOU MAY BE THINKING
ABOUT HAVING IT, BUT
WE DON'T DISCUSS IT.

13:39.792 --> 13:43.166
THAT WAY WE AVOID
THE AWKWARDNESS, AND

13:43.166 --> 13:46.583
IN AVOIDING THE AWKWARDNESS,
WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.041
YOU SEE, IT'S
A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.041
I SOLVED THE PROBLEM
BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.083
BUT, PACEY...IF WE'RE
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS,

13:51.083 --> 13:53.792
WHY IS THERE
ANY AWKWARDNESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.834
BECAUSE NOT TOO LONG AGO,
WE WERE MORE THAN JUST
GOOD FRIENDS, NOW, WEREN'T WE?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.125
YEAH, BUT
WE'RE NOT ANYMORE.

13:57.125 --> 14:01.375
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.000
WHAT, SO AS FAR
AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.375
I SLEPT WITH YOU, AND
THEN I TOOK MYSELF IN
AND GOT REVIRGINIZED?

14:06.375 --> 14:07.417
IN MY  MIND? YES.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.250
OH, SO I NEVER SLEPT
WITH EDDIE OR DAWSON--

14:10.250 --> 14:12.834
OH, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.583
OK, SO BASICALLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

14:14.583 --> 14:17.500
IS THAT THE ONLY WAY
YOU AND I CAN CONTINUE
BEING FRIENDS

14:17.500 --> 14:19.667
IS IF WE LIE
TO EACH OTHER
ABOUT OUR SEX LIVES...

14:19.667 --> 14:23.542
IF WE TAKE THAT
WHOLE GIANT ASPECT
OF OUR LIVES AND JUST...

14:23.542 --> 14:25.250
PRETEND LIKE
IT DOESN'T EXIST?

14:25.250 --> 14:26.250
WORKED FOR YOU AND DAWSON.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.667
WHAT?!

14:28.667 --> 14:30.125
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:31.250 --> 14:33.250
I SAID IT--
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.708
I JUST CAN'T QUITE
BELIEVE MY EARS.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.792
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
ESSENTIALLY UNTRUE
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT?

14:38.792 --> 14:39.792
N--

14:39.792 --> 14:41.750
(CHUCKLES)

14:41.750 --> 14:43.125
NO.
NO. THEN

14:43.125 --> 14:44.041
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:44.041 --> 14:45.375
PACEY, DID IT
EVER OCCUR TO YOU

14:45.375 --> 14:46.708
THAT MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE MY LIFE
THIS WAY...

14:46.708 --> 14:48.500
THAT MAYBE
I HAVE GROWN UP?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.542
HAVE YOU.

14:50.542 --> 14:52.250
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.750
IT MEANS, SIMPLY PUT,
THAT YOU DON'T CARE
WHO I SLEEP WITH.

14:55.750 --> 14:56.583
I COULD'VE HAD SEX
WITH THAT WOMAN

14:56.583 --> 14:58.208
ON THE TABLE
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU,

14:58.208 --> 15:00.166
AND YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE EVEN BATTED
AN EYELASH.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.875
PACEY...YOU SLEPT
WITH MY ROOMMATE
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.875
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR ME TO START TO GET...

15:05.875 --> 15:08.542
SKITTISH ON THE TOPIC
OF YOU AND OTHER WOMEN.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.917
DON'T MAKE ME
SPELL THIS OUT.

15:10.917 --> 15:13.375
DO YOU REALLY NOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.166
NO. I DON'T.
I REALLY DON'T.
I MEAN, DO YOU?

15:15.166 --> 15:18.417
BECAUSE I'M
A BIT CONFUSED HERE.
I MEAN...

15:18.417 --> 15:21.333
ARE YOU UPSET
BECAUSE...I'M UPSET?

15:21.333 --> 15:23.291
ARE YOU UPSET
THAT...I'M NOT UPSET?

15:23.291 --> 15:25.125
ARE YOU UPSET THAT
I'M NOT UPSET ENOUGH?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.166
I ME--

15:30.417 --> 15:31.500
PACEY,
WE BROKE UP...

15:31.500 --> 15:34.250
MOVED ON.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.166
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE

15:36.166 --> 15:38.583
FEELING MISERABLE
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
ENDED BETWEEN US?

15:38.583 --> 15:42.083
OK. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW THAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP,
YES.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.542
A COUPLE OF MONTHS HERE,
THERE, REALLY WOULDN'T
HAVE HURT.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.667
I MEAN, I'M NOT ASKING
FOR THE LIFETIME YOU'VE DEVOTED
TO FEELING BAD ABOUT DAWSON,

15:47.667 --> 15:50.000
BUT JUST A COUPLE
OF WEEKS.
UNBELIEVABLE!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.708
PACEY!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.166
I CAN NEVER WIN,
CAN I?
I GUESS I CAN'T.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.375
IT'S KIND OF LIKE TAKING
MY HEAD AND BEATING IT
UP AGAINST A ROCK.

15:55.375 --> 15:58.291
I MEAN, WHO HAD
MORE SEX? WHO WAS
WITH WHO LONGER?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.583
ISN'T THERE SOME
SORT OF BOY CALCULUS
YOU CAN USE

16:01.583 --> 16:04.125
TO FIGURE OUT WHO WON
AND JUST LEAVE ME
OUT OF IT?

16:04.125 --> 16:08.333
RIGHT, 'CAUSE GOD FORBID
I MIGHT JUST BE TALKING
ABOUT YOU AND ME RIGHT NOW.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.959
THERE IS NO
"YOU AND ME," PACEY.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.917
WE'VE MOVED ON,
AND I'M SORRY

16:12.917 --> 16:14.250
I DIDN'T DASH MYSELF
INTO A THOUSAND PIECES

16:14.250 --> 16:16.750
WHEN YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:16.750 --> 16:19.583
LIFE GOES ON,
NO MATTER
HOW UNGRATIFYING

16:19.583 --> 16:20.959
THAT MAY BE
FOR YOUR MALE EGO.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.000
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT MY EGO.

16:23.000 --> 16:23.875
NO?

16:23.875 --> 16:25.250
REALLY. THEN
WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.750
I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO GO BACK THERE?

16:26.750 --> 16:29.291
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
BACK DOWN THAT LONG ROAD
THAT ONLY ENDS

16:29.291 --> 16:31.125
WITH YOU AND I AR--
I KNOW WHERE THIS ROAD ENDS.

16:31.125 --> 16:34.125
THEN WHAT GOOD
CAN COME OF IT?

16:34.125 --> 16:36.667
TELL ME. I MEAN,
WHY DO YOU,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

16:36.667 --> 16:40.125
WANT TO REVISIT...
SOMETHING THAT
IS BETTER LEFT...

16:43.000 --> 16:44.375
(SIGHS)
(RING)

16:44.375 --> 16:45.625
WELL, ARE YOU
GONNA ANSWER THAT,

16:45.625 --> 16:46.792
OR ARE WE
GONNA FINISH THIS?

16:48.125 --> 16:50.166
WE COULD LIVE
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,

16:50.166 --> 16:52.792
AND WE WOULD
NEVER FINISH THIS.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
HELLO?

16:59.166 --> 17:02.417
WELL, YES. OBVIOUSLY,
WE'RE STILL HERE.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.959
NO, NO. WE DON'T HAVE
ANYPLACE TO GO,
NOW, DO WE?

17:14.666 --> 17:16.834
WELL, YES, OFFICER,
I REALIZE THAT
WE'RE PROBABLY

17:16.834 --> 17:18.208
FAIRLY LOW
ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST,
BUT--

17:20.333 --> 17:23.208
WELL, NO, I WASN'T AWARE
OF THE FREEZING RAIN.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.750
I'M SURE THAT DOES CAUSE
QUITE A FEW ACCIDENTS.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.708
OK. WELL, WE'LL CONTINUE
TO SIT TIGHT HERE.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.708
IF YOU COULD JUST SEND
SOMEONE OUT AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE,

17:31.708 --> 17:33.333
THAT'D BE GREAT.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.041
THANK YOU. YOU, TOO.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.417
(SIGHS)

19:06.500 --> 19:09.250
Pacey over P.A.:
JOEY POTTER, YOU'RE NEEDED
IN ELECTRONICS.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.458
JOEY POTTER
TO ELECTRONICS, PLEASE.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.500
(CLICKS OFF)

19:22.125 --> 19:23.834
IS THIS THING ON?

19:24.708 --> 19:27.792
OK, WELL...AHEM.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.500
HEY...IT'S ME...
OBVIOUSLY.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.834
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST STEP
A LITTLE CLOSER,

19:32.834 --> 19:35.834
AND DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT GONNA BITE.
I COME IN PEACE.

19:35.834 --> 19:39.041
LOOK...YOU AND I...

19:39.041 --> 19:40.500
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
FOR A WHILE.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.917
FOR QUITE A WHILE,
IT SEEMS.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.291
SO I THINK
IT WOULD BE BEST

19:43.291 --> 19:45.208
IF WE COULD COME
TO SOME SORT
OF TRUCE.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.375
AND TO FACILITATE
THIS TRUCE, I'M
WILLING TO ADMIT

19:46.375 --> 19:50.625
TO YOU ON CAMERA
THAT, YES, INDEED,
I AM AN ASS,

19:50.625 --> 19:53.333
WHICH YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNOW.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.417
BETTER
THAN MOST PEOPLE.

19:54.417 --> 19:55.333
AND PERHAPS BETTER
THAN ANYONE ON EARTH.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.083
BUT I DIGRESS.
MY PROPOSAL IS THIS:

19:58.083 --> 20:00.542
THAT WE LEAVE THE PAST
IN THE PAST, WHICH IS
WHERE IT BELONGS ANYWAY,

20:00.542 --> 20:04.834
THAT WE TRY AND MAKE
THE BEST OUT OF
THIS BAD SITUATION,

20:04.834 --> 20:06.083
AND THAT
WE GET COMFORTABLE.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.375
TO WIT--I BOUGHT
YOU SOMETHING.

20:07.375 --> 20:10.375
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
BUY YOU SOMETHING.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.834
PERHAPS PROCURED
WOULD BE A BETTER WORD,

20:11.834 --> 20:13.625
BUT...ANYWAY,
YOU GET MY POINT.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.417
IT'S DOWN THERE
ON THE COUNTER.
I'M NOT SO SURE

20:15.417 --> 20:18.041
ABOUT THE SIZES ANYMORE,
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN
A WHILE, BUT...

20:18.041 --> 20:19.542
WE CAN ALWAYS
EXCHANGE IT.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.125
AND, IF YOU ACCEPT
MY PROPOSAL,

20:21.125 --> 20:23.000
YOU WILL HAVE
AT YOUR DISPOSAL

20:23.000 --> 20:25.500
FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY
THE ABILITY TO MAKE ME
DO ONE THING

20:25.500 --> 20:26.875
I REALLY DO NOT
WANT TO DO.

20:26.875 --> 20:30.000
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY
THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE THAT ABILITY,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.875
BUT I KINDA FIGURE THAT
THAT'S HOW THIS WHOLE
NIGHT FROM HELL STARTED.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.708
YOU WERE DOING
SOMETHING FOR ME

20:35.708 --> 20:37.917
THAT YOU REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO DO...

20:37.917 --> 20:39.917
WHICH IS
WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

20:39.917 --> 20:43.959
OK. OVER AND OUT.

20:52.750 --> 20:53.500
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.959
SHOULDN'T I BE GETTING YOU
OUT OF THOSE CLOTHES?
LATER.

20:58.959 --> 21:02.166
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHERE IT IS--
LATER.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.083
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THOSE SHOES WERE
KILLIN' YOU.

21:09.458 --> 21:10.250
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

21:10.250 --> 21:12.917
YOU SAID "ONE THING,"
PACEY.

21:12.917 --> 21:16.458
NO, I SAID "ONE THING
THAT WOULD HELP YOU."

21:16.458 --> 21:17.375
HOW DOES CHANGING
MY PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
HELP YOU?

21:17.375 --> 21:19.834
BELIEVE ME, IF I
DON'T HAVE TO LOOK

21:19.834 --> 21:21.000
AT THAT THING
ON YOUR FACE
ANYMORE,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.458
I WILL CONSIDER
MYSELF HELPED.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.583
HERE.

21:25.208 --> 21:25.792
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
MAKE ME DO THIS.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.625
YEAH.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.583
HMM.

21:28.583 --> 21:31.333
AFTER ALL WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.458
SO THIS IS WHAT
IT COMES DOWN TO,
DOES IT?

21:36.750 --> 21:39.542
OK. (SIGHS)
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW ONE THING.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.959
I'M NOT GONNA GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

21:41.959 --> 21:45.250
PLEASE. AAH! PACEY!

21:45.250 --> 21:47.291
PACEY.

21:47.291 --> 21:47.583
PACEY!

21:50.959 --> 21:52.708
PACEY?

21:52.708 --> 21:55.750
PACEY!

21:55.750 --> 21:57.750
YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.041
OH--
(RATTLING)

22:11.041 --> 22:12.291
(RATTLING)

22:12.291 --> 22:15.041
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
ONLY MAKING IT
WORSE FOR YOURSELF.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.375
MUCH WORSE.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.917
WHEN I CATCH YOU,
WHO KNOWS WHAT
OTHER BODY PARTS

22:19.917 --> 22:20.583
I'LL REQUIRE YOU
TO SHAVE.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.000
PACEY.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.959
(CRASH)

22:29.959 --> 22:30.959
(CLATTERING)

22:30.959 --> 22:33.291
(CLATTERING)

22:33.291 --> 22:38.083
OW! I THINK I RAN
INTO AN AUTO DISPLAY
CASE OR SOMETHING!

22:38.083 --> 22:41.667
OH...H-HELP ME.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.291
I THINK I'M BLEEDING.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.667
AISLE 3-B!

22:45.667 --> 22:47.417
BRING BAND-AIDS!

22:51.333 --> 22:51.625
(SIGHS)

23:05.166 --> 23:06.500
(TAPPING)

23:10.125 --> 23:12.041
I WOULDN'T MAKE

23:12.041 --> 23:14.834
OHH!
ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS
IF I WERE YOU.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.583
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.
I WOULD.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.125
I DON'T PARTICULARLY
LIKE THAT SUIT
YOU'RE WEARING.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.000
HOW MUCH DID IT COST,
$5, $600?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.083
Move it.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.750
UH-HUH...
BACK IT UP.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.750
(HINGES SQUEAK
LOUDLY)

23:33.750 --> 23:36.542
HEY. I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT FOR ME.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.750
I AM.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.959
OK.

23:39.959 --> 23:42.000
GO.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.041
ALL RIGHT, THIS
IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

23:45.041 --> 23:46.375
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT THIS.

23:46.375 --> 23:50.208
PACEY. IT'S A BEARD.
IT'LL GROW BACK.
NOT THAT IT SHOULD.

23:50.208 --> 23:52.583
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL,
ANYWAY?

23:52.583 --> 23:54.375
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW BALLPLAYERS

23:54.375 --> 23:56.708
DON'T CHANGE THEIR SOCKS
DURING A WINNING STREAK?

23:56.708 --> 23:57.792
NO.

23:57.792 --> 23:58.792
OK, WELL, THEY DON'T

23:58.792 --> 24:00.583
BECAUSE THEY RESPECT
THE STREAK.

24:00.583 --> 24:01.583
AND YOU
PERCEIVE YOURSELF

24:01.583 --> 24:03.500
AS BEING ON SOME SORT
OF WINNING STREAK.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.000
YES.
CAUSED BY THAT THING
ON YOUR FACE.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.500
YES.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.708
FINE. I GIVE UP.

24:14.667 --> 24:15.917
YOU GIVE UP?

24:17.542 --> 24:20.291
YOU'RE GIVING UP
THAT EASILY.

24:20.291 --> 24:23.708
YEAH. IF IT MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU,
PACEY.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.708
I MEAN, I HAVE
NO DESIRE TO MONKEY

24:25.708 --> 24:28.208
WITH SOME CENTURIES-OLD
SPORTS TRADITION.

24:28.208 --> 24:30.041
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO LOSE THE...

24:30.041 --> 24:31.542
TRIPLE CROWN
OR WHATEVER.

24:31.542 --> 24:33.708
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
YOUR FACE AGAIN.

24:33.708 --> 24:34.041
IS THAT A CRIME?

24:34.041 --> 24:36.792
NO.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.959
SO THAT'S IT...
END OF STORY.
IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.583
YEAH. BUT YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE
YOUR SOCKS.

24:53.792 --> 24:54.750
(RATTLING)

24:54.750 --> 24:56.000
(ELECTRONIC BUZZ)

24:56.000 --> 24:58.708
(RATTLING)

25:01.166 --> 25:02.959
I SAID B-3.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.166
OK, FINE. YOU SUNK
MY BATTLESHIP.

25:05.166 --> 25:07.000
I OFFICIALLY SUCK
AT THIS GAME.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.625
WELL, WE CAN'T ALL
BE MASTER STRATEGISTS,
NOW, CAN WE?

25:11.125 --> 25:14.250
SO, WHAT'S NEXT?
OPERATION? RISK?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

25:15.458 --> 25:16.792
WHAT?

25:16.792 --> 25:18.500
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

25:18.500 --> 25:19.166
YEAH. FIRE AWAY.

25:19.166 --> 25:22.000
ARE YOU HAPPY?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.917
ME?

25:24.917 --> 25:26.125
YEAH. I MEAN
REALLY HAPPY,

25:26.125 --> 25:28.500
NOT SUPERFICIALLY,
WE-ALL-HAVE-
OUR-HEALTH HAPPY.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.417
WHY? ARE YOU?

25:30.417 --> 25:32.667
MMM...

25:32.667 --> 25:34.125
YEAH. I THINK I AM.

25:34.125 --> 25:37.166
WHICH IS WEIRD,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING

25:37.166 --> 25:39.208
ALL THAT SPECTACULAR
GOING ON IN MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.166
IT'S JUST THAT...

25:40.166 --> 25:42.083
(SIGHS)

25:42.083 --> 25:44.500
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
I FEEL DIFFERENT.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.959
LIKE...I'VE ALWAYS
HAD THIS TENDENCY

25:46.959 --> 25:48.750
TO ASSUME THAT CHANGE,
WHEN IT HAPPENS,

25:48.750 --> 25:51.667
CAN ONLY BE
FOR THE WORSE.
YOU KNOW?

25:51.667 --> 25:53.834
AND LATELY, I KINDA FEEL
LIKE THAT'S NOT TRUE...

25:53.834 --> 25:56.917
LIKE WHATEVER'S WAITING
FOR ME OUT THERE...

25:56.917 --> 25:58.375
MAY NOT BE THAT BAD.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.875
AND EVEN IF IT IS...

25:59.875 --> 26:02.667
THEN NOT KNOWING
ABOUT IT...

26:02.667 --> 26:04.500
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
THE GOOD PART.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.208
MMM...I DON'T KNOW.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.542
(CHUCKLES)

26:11.542 --> 26:14.250
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M MAKING
ANY SENSE.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.458
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO SAY...

26:17.458 --> 26:21.166
IS THAT YOU REALLY
LIKE THAT GUY.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.125
"THAT GUY"?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.583
YEAH. THAT EDDIE GUY.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.041
Yeah.

26:35.333 --> 26:36.667
I DID.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.333
BUT...THE PAST...

26:42.333 --> 26:44.208
AS THEY SAY,
IS THE PAST.

26:44.208 --> 26:45.125
AND THAT STILL
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

26:45.125 --> 26:47.041
THAT YOU NEVER
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.083
I DON'T
REALLY HAVE TO.
I MEAN,

26:50.083 --> 26:52.250
HOW COULD I NOT
BE HAPPY? YOU'VE SEEN
MY CAR, RIGHT?

26:52.250 --> 26:54.583
PACEY!
(CHUCKLES)

26:54.583 --> 26:54.708
REAL ANSWER,
PLEASE.

26:56.166 --> 26:58.917
REAL ANSWER?

26:58.917 --> 26:59.583
OK, FINE.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.041
THE REAL ANSWER IS THIS.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.208
I CURRENTLY HAVE
IN MY LIFE

27:04.208 --> 27:06.625
EVERYTHING THAT I COULD
POSSIBLY WANT.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.291
EXCEPT ONE THING.

27:10.291 --> 27:12.625
AND WHAT'S THAT?

27:13.917 --> 27:15.458
NACHOS?

27:15.458 --> 27:17.291
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE REALLY NOT
GONNA EAT THAT.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.750
WELL, YOU NIXED
MY WHOLE BUILD-
YOUR-OWN-SUNDAE IDEA.

27:19.750 --> 27:21.750
WELL, YEAH, IT'S
A LITTLE TOO COLD
FOR ICE CREAM.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.708
IT IS NEVER TOO COLD
FOR ICE CREAM.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.625
PACEY, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
SEEM TO BE EATING

27:25.625 --> 27:27.458
DURING KEY MOMENTS
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP?

27:27.458 --> 27:28.875
I DON'T KNOW.
IS THIS A KEY MOMENT
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP?

27:28.875 --> 27:31.125
WELL, IT WOULD'VE BEEN
IF YOU WOULD'VE LET ME

27:31.125 --> 27:32.625
GET RID OF THAT THING
OFF YOUR FACE.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.208
IS THIS WHAT YOU CONSIDER
LETTING IT DIE?

27:34.208 --> 27:35.458
WHAT? WE'VE ALREADY
ESTABLISHED THAT THE THEME
FOR THE EVENING

27:35.458 --> 27:37.667
IS PICKING AT OLD SCABS.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.959
CAN I HAVE MORE,
PLEASE?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.583
LESS ICE THIS TIME.

27:41.583 --> 27:43.875
LESS ICE.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.125
YOU KNOW...
I THINK I ACTUALLY MISSED

27:46.125 --> 27:47.250
MY TRUE CALLING IN LIFE.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.375
JERK?

27:48.375 --> 27:49.708
MM-HMM.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.667
I MEANT SODA.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.959
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.
IT JUST REALLY WASN'T
ALL THAT FUNNY.

27:54.959 --> 27:56.959
SO...CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.417
A LITTLE COTTON CANDY?
UHH!

27:58.417 --> 27:59.166
GROSS.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.875
YOU WANT A PRETZEL?
NO.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.417
I THINK THOSE
WERE PROBABLY MADE

28:02.417 --> 28:03.208
WHEN I WAS  A VIRGIN.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.125
OH, YEAH.
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

28:04.125 --> 28:06.333
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE SHOULD STOP.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.667
WE DON'T WANT TO FILL UP
ON STARCHES BEFORE WE GO
RAID THE CANDY AISLE.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.333
PACEY, WE CAN'T EAT CANDY
THIS LATE AT NIGHT.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.583
WE'LL ROT OUR TEETH.

28:11.583 --> 28:12.792
SO THEN WE'LL BRUSH THEM.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.333
AND IF WE'RE
FEELIN' CRAZY,
WE CAN FLOSS.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.875
'CAUSE YOU SEE,
THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT
BEIN' LOCKED IN A KMART.

28:18.875 --> 28:21.834
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
IN A KMART. YOU CAN FILL UP
ON SUGARY SNACKS.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.500
YOU CAN CATCH UP
ON YOUR DENTAL HYGIENE.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.667
IN FACT, I'M STARTIN'
TO LIKE THIS IDEA SO MUCH,
I MAY NEVER LEAVE.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.458
OH, MY GOD.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.542
HOMEWORK. COME ON.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.959
WAIT. BRING POPCORN.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.500
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

28:50.500 --> 28:53.875
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.458
WHAT COULD BE
MORE AMERICAN

28:55.458 --> 28:59.125
THAN BITTER INVECTIVE,
RAMPANT PARANOIA, AND
GAS-GUZZLING CADDIES?

28:59.125 --> 29:00.875
SO, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY TOMORROW WHEN HETSON
PUTS ME ON THE SPOT?

29:05.542 --> 29:08.208
THROW THE WORDS
"POST MODERNIST"
AND "SUBJECTIVITY"

29:08.208 --> 29:09.917
INTO THE SAME SENTENCE.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

29:09.917 --> 29:12.959
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE
WHY YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT YOUR JOB.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.417
OH, YEAH? WHY IS THAT?

29:15.417 --> 29:16.583
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO FULL OF--
UH!

29:16.583 --> 29:18.458
NOW, THAT'S
NOT CALLED FOR.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.166
WE DON'T MAKE FUN
OF MY SOURCE
OF INCOME.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.208
(SACK RATTLES)

29:21.208 --> 29:22.417
COME ON. LET'S GO.

29:22.417 --> 29:23.625
WHY?

29:23.625 --> 29:25.291
'CAUSE
I'M GETTIN' BORED

29:25.291 --> 29:26.250
WITH ALL THIS
SITTIN' AROUND. LET'S
DO SOMETHIN' ACTIVE.
NO.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.500
NO? IT'S MY TURN
TO CHOOSE, ISN'T IT?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.250
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY.
THERE WILL BE NO BIKES,

29:30.250 --> 29:32.834
NO ROLLERBLADING, AND NO
YOU SHOOTING HOCKEY PUCKS
AT MY HEAD.

29:32.834 --> 29:35.083
OH, NOW, COME ON.
THOSE WEREN'T
REAL HOCKEY PUCKS.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.458
THOSE WERE LITTLE
PLASTIC INDOOR ONES.

29:36.458 --> 29:37.959
PACEY, I THINK
THE GOAL OF THE EVENING

29:37.959 --> 29:40.291
SHOULD BE TO AVOID
HEAD INJURIES.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.417
(SIGHS) OK, FINE.

29:42.417 --> 29:44.917
I STILL GOT
SOMETHIN' FOR US
TO DO.

29:46.041 --> 29:49.000
I PROMISE YOU
THIS IS NOT
GOING TO HURT.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.417
NOW, HOW COULD
YOU POSSIBLY MAKE
A PROMISE LIKE THAT

29:51.417 --> 29:52.458
ABOUT WHAT IT IS
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO,

29:52.458 --> 29:54.542
SEEING AS YOU'VE
NEVER DONE IT BEFORE?

29:54.542 --> 29:57.000
JUST BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT GONNA BE GOOD AT IT.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.667
I WAS GOOD AT SEX, WASN'T I?

29:59.875 --> 30:03.917
SORRY. FORGET THAT.
SORE SUBJECT.

30:03.917 --> 30:05.333
ANYWAY...YOU KNOW,

30:05.333 --> 30:07.208
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT POTENTIAL
BLOOD LOSS,

30:07.208 --> 30:08.792
YOU COULD ALWAYS
DO IT YOURSELF,
YOU KNOW.

30:08.792 --> 30:11.166
WELL, I THINK
I'VE ALREADY DISPLAYED
THE FACT THAT I JUST--

30:11.166 --> 30:13.458
I LACK THE IRON WILL
NECESSARY TO DO THIS.

30:13.458 --> 30:14.875
GOOD.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.250
RRR!

30:18.417 --> 30:20.000
OK.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.333
NOW...

30:21.333 --> 30:23.375
THE IMPORTANT THING
TO REMEMBER
IS NOT TO MOVE.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.667
AND NO TALKING.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.625
WHOOH.

30:28.625 --> 30:30.417
LAST CHANCE TO BAIL.

30:30.417 --> 30:31.625
WELL, IT'S KINDA HARD
TO TELL YOU

30:31.625 --> 30:32.959
I WANT TO BAIL
IF I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK, ISN'T IT?

30:32.959 --> 30:35.625
OH. WELL,
BLINK TWICE
OR SOMETHING.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.834
THAT'S NO KIND
OF SOLUTION.

30:36.834 --> 30:39.041
THAT PRESUPPOSES
THAT I'M GONNA STOP
BLINKING.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.458
WHO STOPS BLINKING?
REALLY, THAT'S--
OK.

30:41.458 --> 30:42.834
SHUT UP.

30:43.458 --> 30:45.500
UNHH!

30:49.917 --> 30:51.125
REGULAR...
OR MENTHOL?

30:53.083 --> 30:55.500
ARE WE SMOKING,
OR ARE WE SHAVING?

30:55.500 --> 30:58.834
PACEY WITTER--
FRIEND TO WOMEN.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.208
I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO GO WITH SENSITIVE
SKIN.

31:09.333 --> 31:10.041
OK...

31:15.375 --> 31:17.375
MMM...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.500
IT'S OK. DON'T BE SHY.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.417
MMM.
(CHUCKLES)

31:21.417 --> 31:22.041
(CHUCKLES)

31:27.208 --> 31:28.458
(CHUCKLES)

31:29.583 --> 31:30.875
OK...

31:30.875 --> 31:32.083
MMM, MMM,
MMM, MMM.
AHEM.

31:40.792 --> 31:42.083
OK.

31:48.125 --> 31:48.834
THIS IS HARDER
THAN LEGS.

31:48.834 --> 31:51.959
ALTHOUGH NOT
DISSIMILAR

31:51.959 --> 31:52.458
MHHH!
TO KNEES.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.458
Sorry.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.792
(CHUCKLES)

32:18.000 --> 32:18.959
THERE.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.250
HELLO, CHIN.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.834
YOU'RE BACK.
(CHUCKLES)

32:21.834 --> 32:23.917
WELL...I WAS
NEVER REALLY GONE.

32:23.917 --> 32:25.000
YOU WEREN'T?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.250
MM-MMM.

32:28.291 --> 32:30.458
IT KINDA SEEMED
LIKE IT.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.708
(SIGHS)

33:10.917 --> 33:13.083
(CHUCKLES)
What was that?

33:15.250 --> 33:17.125
I DON'T KNOW.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.333
BUT...YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU SAID

33:19.333 --> 33:22.583
YOU WERE WILLING
TO BE SURPRISED
BY THE FUTURE?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.834
YEAH.

33:24.834 --> 33:25.917
SURPRISE.

33:25.917 --> 33:28.875
HOW COME YOU
DON'T SEEM SURPRISED?

33:31.125 --> 33:33.333
WELL...MAYBE
BECAUSE I'VE...

33:33.333 --> 33:36.834
WANTED TO KISS YOU
EVER SINCE I SAW YOU
IN THAT OUTFIT.

33:38.458 --> 33:39.708
NO. UM...

33:39.708 --> 33:42.500
NOT THAT  OUTFIT.
THE ONE...

33:42.500 --> 33:45.041
UH...THE PREV--
WELL, I MEAN, NOT--

33:45.041 --> 33:46.041
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:46.041 --> 33:48.125
(CLEARS THROAT)

33:48.125 --> 33:50.458
YOU WERE WANTING
TO KISS ME ALL NIGHT?

33:50.458 --> 33:51.625
YES.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.959
EVEN WHEN YOU
WERE YELLING AT ME.

33:54.959 --> 33:57.458
(CHUCKLES) ESPECIALLY
WHEN I WAS YELLING AT YOU.

33:57.458 --> 33:59.500
EVEN WHEN
YOU WERE FLIRTING
WITH THAT OTHER GIRL?

33:59.500 --> 34:01.625
YEAH. THEN, TOO.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.041
SO...

34:04.041 --> 34:06.667
IS THIS...
SOME SORT OF...

34:06.667 --> 34:09.083
RECENT NEW DEVELOPMENT
IN YOUR LIFE?

34:10.375 --> 34:12.458
WANTING TO KISS YOU?

34:12.458 --> 34:13.875
NO. IT'S SORT OF
ALWAYS THERE...

34:13.875 --> 34:16.375
LIKE...WHITE NOISE,
OR...

34:16.375 --> 34:18.375
THE SECRET SERVICE,
OR THE THREAT
OF NUCLEAR WAR,

34:18.375 --> 34:23.000
FOR THAT MATTER.
JUST SOMETHIN'
YOU GET USED TO.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.667
AND THAT...
DOESN'T AT ALL
FREAK YOU OUT.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.708
WELL, YES AND NO.

34:27.708 --> 34:28.625
WHICH ONE, PACE?

34:28.625 --> 34:30.958
HMM.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.458
YES.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.417
EXPLAIN.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.208
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.083
TRY.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.667
OK.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.917
WELL...

34:50.583 --> 34:52.500
(CHUCKLES)

34:54.625 --> 34:56.875
IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY
THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING

34:56.875 --> 34:58.542
ALL THAT FRIENDLY
TOWARD YOU LATELY.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.583
YOU'VE BEEN FEELING
MORE  THAN FRIENDLY.

35:01.583 --> 35:03.667
YES.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.083
AND THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD EXPRESS THAT

35:08.083 --> 35:10.250
WAS TO PICK
A FIGHT WITH ME.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.917
I SUPPOSE
THE ANSWER TO THAT
WOULD...ALSO BE YES.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.583
WHY IS THAT, EXACTLY?

35:17.583 --> 35:19.250
I DO NOT KNOW.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.250
YOU MUST KNOW
SOMETHING.

35:25.417 --> 35:28.041
(SIGHS) WHAT I KNOW
IS THAT...

35:30.875 --> 35:33.166
YOU AND I WERE
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS,

35:33.166 --> 35:35.917
PERHAPS THE ONLY THING...

35:35.917 --> 35:37.875
THAT EVER MADE
TOTAL AND COMPLETE SENSE

35:37.875 --> 35:39.667
IN MY LIFE.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.250
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW.

35:46.708 --> 35:48.542
YOU KNOW, WE FOUGHT
CONSTANTLY.

35:48.542 --> 35:49.792
OH, DON'T I KNOW IT.

35:49.792 --> 35:52.458
AND THERE ARE REASONS
WHY YOU AND I
DIDN'T WORK.

35:52.458 --> 35:56.041
I MEAN, VALID REASONS.
A-AND...IT...

35:56.041 --> 35:58.291
MY LIFE IS FINALLY--
RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT IT.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.667
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY,
ISN'T IT?

35:59.667 --> 36:02.333
PACEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

36:02.333 --> 36:03.375
UM...

36:05.375 --> 36:09.041
I'M FLATTERED.
I'M...

36:09.041 --> 36:12.333
CONFUSED.
I'M STUNNED.

36:12.333 --> 36:15.417
ARE YOU WISHING
I HADN'T SAID ANYTHING?

36:17.166 --> 36:18.417
No.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.250
I JUST NEED TO...
CAN I JUST
SLEEP ON THIS?

36:25.250 --> 36:28.417
YEAH. I THINK
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.166
HEY, PACE, DID YOU--

36:44.166 --> 36:47.583
PUT ALL THE STUFF BACK?
YEAH. THOUGH SOME OF IT
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR,

36:47.583 --> 36:48.834
LIKE THE CLOTHES.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.917
(SIGHS)

36:53.917 --> 36:55.041
PACEY, DID YOU--

36:55.041 --> 36:56.417
IF THE NEXT WORDS
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

36:56.417 --> 36:58.834
ARE "TAKE OUT THE TRASH,"
I WILL OFFICIALLY
HAVE A PREVIEW

36:58.834 --> 36:59.583
OF WHAT IT'D BE LIKE
TO BE MARRIED TO YOU.

36:59.583 --> 37:03.500
AND?

37:03.500 --> 37:05.542
IT AIN'T PRETTY.

37:05.542 --> 37:06.583
(CHUCKLES)

37:06.583 --> 37:08.792
I WAS GOING TO SAY...

37:08.792 --> 37:10.083
IS...

37:10.083 --> 37:11.291
DID YOU KNOW?

37:13.875 --> 37:15.333
DID I KNOW WHAT?

37:15.333 --> 37:18.667
THIS WAS
A DREAM COME TRUE?

37:18.667 --> 37:21.250
WHICH PART?

37:21.250 --> 37:22.458
ALL OF IT.

37:27.792 --> 37:30.000
WHEN YOU AND I
WERE ON THE BOAT...

37:32.875 --> 37:35.542
I USED TO DREAM
THAT WE'D BE CAST AWAY
SOMEWHERE.

37:35.542 --> 37:39.250
YOU KNOW, YOUR...
STANDARD TROPICAL ISLAND

37:39.250 --> 37:42.750
WITH THE WHITE
SAND BEACHES AND...

37:42.750 --> 37:45.291
GIANT STARS OVERHEAD.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.041
WE'D WEAR NO CLOTHES,

37:47.041 --> 37:50.542
AND WE'D...SPLASH
IN THE SURF ALL DAY.

37:50.542 --> 37:52.250
AND THEN AT NIGHT...

37:52.250 --> 37:53.458
THE MOON WOULD BE
THIS...

37:55.083 --> 37:57.625
WELL,
THIS GIANT THING.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.375
AND IT WAS
ALWAYS FULL.

38:01.375 --> 38:03.166
I LIKE THIS FANTASY.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.834
I'D CATCH FISH
WITH MY BARE HANDS...

38:06.834 --> 38:08.458
MAKE FIRE
WITHOUT MATCHES.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.917
I'D  MAKE THE FIRES.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.542
WHO PAID ATTENTION
IN SCIENCE CLASS?

38:12.542 --> 38:13.417
OK. GOOD POINT.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.708
BESIDES...
IT'S MY  FANTASY.

38:16.708 --> 38:19.750
AND I GUESS I...
NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT BEFORE

38:19.750 --> 38:21.625
BECAUSE IT'S...

38:21.625 --> 38:23.834
(CHUCKLING)
EMBARRASSING.
YOU KNOW?

38:23.834 --> 38:26.875
I MEAN...
NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL.

38:28.583 --> 38:32.583
WELL, I GUESS YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.875
WHAT'S THAT?

38:33.875 --> 38:36.083
THERE ARE  ABOUT
A THOUSAND REASONS

38:36.083 --> 38:37.667
WHY YOU AND I
WOULD NEVER WORK.

38:39.417 --> 38:42.625
THERE'S ONE THING
IN THE PRO COLUMN.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.208
WHAT'S THAT?

39:13.000 --> 39:16.208
DOESN'T MEAN WHAT
YOU THINK IT MEANS.

39:16.208 --> 39:18.250
WELL, THEN WHAT
DOES IT MEAN?

39:20.458 --> 39:23.542
WELL...
IT MEANS THAT...

39:23.542 --> 39:25.083
WELL, I'M COLD.

39:25.083 --> 39:25.458
OH.

39:28.166 --> 39:28.667
AND...

39:30.667 --> 39:32.834
I'M STILL THINKING
ABOUT IT...

39:36.291 --> 39:39.291
AND I MISS YOU,
PACE.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.291
I miss you, too.

39:48.959 --> 39:49.375
(SIGHING)
MMM...

39:49.375 --> 39:51.083
(CHUCKLES)

40:04.917 --> 40:06.417
(YAWNS)

40:11.917 --> 40:13.208
DUDE...

40:14.375 --> 40:16.875
THIS IS TOTALLY...
UNCOOL.

40:16.875 --> 40:17.375
UM...

40:17.375 --> 40:18.959
JOEY? AHEM!

40:18.959 --> 40:20.041
5 MORE MINUTES.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.917
NO, NO. NO.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.083
I THINK NOW
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

40:24.083 --> 40:25.458
WHY?

40:30.166 --> 40:33.333
LIKE...I MEAN...

40:33.333 --> 40:34.834
YOU'RE ALLOWED...

40:34.834 --> 40:36.083
TO, LIKE,
TEST THINGS...

40:36.083 --> 40:37.959
AND STUFF...

40:37.959 --> 40:40.250
BUT THE MANAGER
IS GONNA BE...

40:41.417 --> 40:44.375
LIKE, HIS MIND
IS GONNA BE BLOWN.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.917
THIS--NO NEED TO CALL
THE MANAGER,

40:45.917 --> 40:48.041
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE JUST
ABOUT TO LEAVE.

40:50.417 --> 40:51.583
HEY.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.959
HEY.

40:55.917 --> 40:59.834
SO, IS THIS...
LIKE, YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

40:59.834 --> 41:01.458
Joey: NO.

41:01.458 --> 41:04.291
WE JUST SLEEP TOGETHER
FROM TIME TO TIME.

41:04.291 --> 41:06.417
DO YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

41:11.750 --> 41:13.000
VERY NICE.

41:21.708 --> 41:24.125
SO, THIS IS IT.

41:24.125 --> 41:25.625
YES, IT IS.

41:25.625 --> 41:26.625
THERE WERE
NO SECURITY TAGS
ON THESE?

41:26.625 --> 41:29.667
OH. NO. YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY LOOK INTO THAT.

41:31.083 --> 41:33.208
AND THIS.

41:34.417 --> 41:36.458
A DVD THAT'S...
OPENED.

41:36.458 --> 41:39.583
OH. AND, UH...
THIS, TOO.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.792
AND A RAZOR
THAT'S...OPENED.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.375
(SIGHS)

41:44.375 --> 41:47.917
OK, AND YOUR TOTAL
IS 98.15.

41:47.917 --> 41:49.125
I CAN PAY YOU BACK.
MY PURSE IS--

41:49.125 --> 41:49.834
I GOT IT.

41:49.834 --> 41:52.125
SEEMS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

41:52.125 --> 41:53.625
FOR A DREAM COME TRUE.

41:55.250 --> 41:56.750
I CERTAINLY HOPE
YOU FOUND EVERYTHING

41:56.750 --> 41:57.917
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
TODAY.

41:57.917 --> 42:01.083
WELL...NOT EVERYTHING,
BUT WE FOUND WHAT WE NEEDED,

42:01.083 --> 42:02.834
WHICH, AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,
IS SOMETIMES JUST AS IMPORTANT.

42:02.834 --> 42:04.959
IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE.
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU FOUND

42:04.959 --> 42:07.667
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU NEEDED TODAY,
WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT

42:07.667 --> 42:08.500
OF WAKING UP TOMORROW
AND DOING IT
ALL OVER AGAIN?

42:08.500 --> 42:11.000
IT JUST WOULDN'T
SEEM WORTH IT.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.125
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S ON A ONE-DAY PASS
FROM THE ASYLUM.

42:14.125 --> 42:16.166
BUT...IN ALL FAIRNESS,
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

42:16.166 --> 42:19.125
THAT I WILL BE WRITING A LETTER
TO THE HOME OFFICE ABOUT THIS.

42:19.125 --> 42:20.917
YOU WILL?
YEAH.

42:20.917 --> 42:21.750
BECAUSE THIS STORE...

42:21.750 --> 42:24.500
IS PERFECT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.166
DON'T CHANGE A THING.

42:29.083 --> 42:30.333
THANK YOU.

42:30.333 --> 42:31.834
HOME?
HOME.

42:38.291 --> 42:41.000
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
OFFER TO CARRY
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.458
SURE.

42:42.458 --> 42:44.542
AND YOU ARE
LETTING ME DRIVE.
RIGHT?

42:44.542 --> 42:45.708
DRIVE? MY CAR?

42:45.708 --> 42:48.375
HA HA!
DO I APPEAR TO HAVE
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS?

42:48.375 --> 42:49.625
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCES

42:49.625 --> 42:50.792
UNDER WHICH
YOU WOULD BE
DRIVING MY CAR.

42:50.792 --> 42:52.208
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE THIS PROBLEM

42:52.208 --> 42:53.625
IF YOU HADN'T
TAUGHT ME HOW TO DRIVE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

42:53.625 --> 42:54.208
BUT YOU SEE,
I DON'T  HAVE
A PROBLEM, BECAUSE--

42:54.208 --> 42:56.834
WE'LL SEE.
