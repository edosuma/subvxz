WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.618
[Narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.713 --> 00:05.123
I don't care what Jack said.

00:05.214 --> 00:08.251
They've got him and we have to
get him back. I owe him that.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.003
[Kate] The man, you've seen him?

00:10.094 --> 00:12.085
[Sayid] On a feed
from the Pearl Station.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.466
Why are we continuing
to play this game

00:14.557 --> 00:17.720
when we all know it has
moved to the next stage?

00:21.314 --> 00:23.851
This is a map showing
electrical and data cabling

00:23.941 --> 00:27.729
comprised of houses and dormitories.
Sounds like a place worth visiting.

00:28.613 --> 00:32.322
[Desmond] When I saw the lightning
hit the roof, you were electrocuted.

00:32.408 --> 00:35.241
When you heard Claire,
you drowned trying to save her.

00:35.328 --> 00:37.034
l dove in so you never went in!

00:37.121 --> 00:39.828
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you,

00:39.916 --> 00:41.622
but no matter what I try to do,

00:41.709 --> 00:43.449
you're going to die, Charlie.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.959
[ticking]

01:30.258 --> 01:32.590
Mum? Mum?

01:32.677 --> 01:35.544
- [approaching siren]
- Mum! Mum! Mum!

01:36.806 --> 01:40.674
Mum! Mum! Mum!

01:50.569 --> 01:52.105
[Charlie] Oh, look, Aaron.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.858
Your mom has finally
decided to wake up.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.860
Mmm.

01:59.036 --> 02:02.449
Only way I could get you to sleep in
was to borrow the midget.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.996
[chuckles]

02:04.625 --> 02:06.957
And what is all this?

02:07.044 --> 02:11.287
An aperitif of
Mysterious lsland fruit

02:11.382 --> 02:15.876
before the breakfast picnic
l have set up in your honor...

02:16.554 --> 02:18.795
...a short walk down the beach.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.505
- What's gotten into you, Charlie?
- Sorry?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.467
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week, and...

02:24.562 --> 02:27.770
...now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

02:27.857 --> 02:29.188
I woke up and I thought,

02:29.275 --> 02:32.642
it's time to stop feeling
sorry for yourself and seize the day.

02:32.737 --> 02:37.697
I can't think of anyone I would rather
do some day-seizing with than you.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.571
So, what do you say?

02:42.371 --> 02:47.286
Let's drop the cherub off
with Auntie Sun and Uncle Jin

02:47.376 --> 02:51.710
and you and | go for a little stroll.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.412
I would love to.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.051
[Sayid] From the position
of this stream, we should be here.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.924
If the scale is right,

03:01.015 --> 03:03.506
his people are two miles
in that direction.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.514
I don't expect you to confirm that.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.149
That's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.692
I'm not sure it's accurate.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.489
Well, certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.691
The stick did get us to that station.

03:21.786 --> 03:24.152
The station which you
accidentally blew up?

03:24.246 --> 03:28.410
If you warned me the basement was rigged
with 0-4, | might've been more careful.

03:34.173 --> 03:37.040
Why don't you just tell us
if we're going the right way?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.670
You're going the right way.

03:38.761 --> 03:42.379
- Remind me why we're keeping him alive?
- What, we shoot him like a dog?

03:42.473 --> 03:45.215
- No. I like dogs.
- [Danielle] He's right.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.096
They will not trade
his life for your friend's.

03:48.187 --> 03:52.055
- We should shoot him.
- Enough. Nobody's shooting anybody.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.891
The map says where they are,
he says the map is right.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.816
So just keep moving.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.238
OK. Here we are. Here we are.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.743
- Not bad, eh?
- Not bad at all. [chuckling]

04:09.834 --> 04:11.916
All right, if you'll take your seat,

04:12.002 --> 04:15.130
we will begin with
our first course,

04:15.214 --> 04:18.581
which is cereal. Then
we have a fresh fruit salad...

04:18.676 --> 04:20.883
- Good morning.
- ...and...

04:21.512 --> 04:23.503
Good morning, yourself.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.886
- What brings you down the beach?
- Boar are thick.

04:28.227 --> 04:32.015
l was hoping you might
wanna join me in a hunt.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.269
Oh, well, thanks for the invite,

04:35.359 --> 04:40.228
but as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.938
Well, I think hunting might be a...

04:43.033 --> 04:45.775
...a better way
to spend your day, Charlie.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.452
Of all the things you could
choose to do today,

04:48.539 --> 04:50.655
hunting with me
might be your best option.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.456
Oh, my God.
Oh... Oh, my God.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.957
- What is it?
- I know how to get us off this island.

05:26.285 --> 05:29.072
- Sun! Jin!
- Claire? What's the matter?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.994
I need Jin's nets and fish.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.333
Hurry, and buckets.
I need those too.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.702
[speaks Korean]

05:34.793 --> 05:36.954
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

05:37.046 --> 05:40.664
They flew over, they'll only be
here today, so we need to catch it now.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.999
Oh, this sounds like fun!

05:43.594 --> 05:46.381
- Can you get some nets?
- Nets for what, Barb...

05:49.642 --> 05:52.008
Nets for what, "Claire"?

05:52.102 --> 05:55.640
OK, five minutes ago, a flock
of sea birds flew over my head.

05:55.731 --> 05:59.349
Sea birds are migratory,
they're gonna keep heading south.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.527
- I don't understand why we need to...
- They're tagged!

06:03.614 --> 06:05.229
"Tagged?"

06:05.324 --> 06:07.610
Scientists tag birds
so they can track them.

06:07.701 --> 06:12.070
So when they eventually land in
Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

06:12.164 --> 06:13.950
somebody's gonna gather them up.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.333
- We can send a message.
- If we can catch one.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.705
OK, so here's the plan.

06:19.797 --> 06:23.506
First we cut up fish, make chum,
that will get the birds in the water.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.629
And then we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.802
Charlie, can you go
get some knives?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.009
Charlie?

06:33.394 --> 06:35.305
- Charlie!
- Yeah.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.886
Uh...

06:36.981 --> 06:39.688
How do you even know
this stuff about birds, Claire?

06:39.775 --> 06:42.312
l, um... I watched a lot of
nature shows with my mum.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.769
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.779
ljust... Well, I...

06:47.866 --> 06:51.154
I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.582
What happened to "seizing the day"?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.003
I'm sorry.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.123
I don't see the point.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.267
[man] Hold still, dear,
just another second.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.188
There. We're through now.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.942
Ms. Littleton, l'm Officer Barnes.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.945
Sorry to bother you, but
I need to ask you a few questions.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.368
Can I ask you
how the accident happened?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.284
A truck forced us off the road.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.998
OK. And who was driving?

07:45.341 --> 07:46.501
Me.

07:48.886 --> 07:52.128
- Has anyone contacted your father?
- He died when l was two.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.962
Sorry to hear that.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.809
I spoke with the truck driver.
He's fine, by the way.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.603
- Um, he said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.850
About what speed
would you say that happened?

08:05.944 --> 08:07.320
It came out of nowhere.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.362
- I didn't...
- That's not the question | asked.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.074
I don't... I don't know
how fast I was driving.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.953
Why are you even
asking me these questions?

08:18.040 --> 08:21.624
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.293
My mother is in surgery.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.876
- She's not dead!
- Right.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.302
- So she is.
- This is not my fault!

08:36.225 --> 08:37.681
Didn't say it was.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.258
G'day, Ms. Littleton.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.778
Can I ask you something?

09:07.506 --> 09:10.373
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

09:12.886 --> 09:16.595
...and you haven't asked me a single
question about her. You haven't...

09:16.682 --> 09:19.048
Your friend, Jack...

09:19.977 --> 09:21.808
...you care about him?

09:23.856 --> 09:25.596
Yes.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.766
lmagine 16 years from now,

09:28.861 --> 09:32.729
you're told he was still alive,
but in your heart

09:32.823 --> 09:37.362
you know that he wouldn't remember you,
he wouldn't know you.

09:39.455 --> 09:43.073
He wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.674
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

09:56.513 --> 09:59.346
...because I do not
want to know the answers.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.691
- Water?
- No, thank you.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.784
So how did you get here?
How'd you get onto this island?

10:23.874 --> 10:27.583
Don't waste your breath.
Whatever he says will be a lie.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.955
l was recruited when l was 24.

10:30.047 --> 10:33.665
- l was approached by a man...
- I didn't ask when. | asked how.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.000
They brought me on the submarine.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.881
So your people can come and go
whenever they want?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.508
Go, yes.

10:40.599 --> 10:45.184
But two weeks ago, our underwater beacon
stopped emitting its locator signal.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.307
There was an event,
an electromagnetic pulse.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.731
- It would be impossible to come back.
- Why would you want to come back?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.184
You would not understand.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.863
Try me.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.782
l misspoke.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.700
What I meant to say is,

11:02.788 --> 11:05.575
- you are not capable of understanding.
- And why not?

11:05.666 --> 11:09.625
- Kate...
- Because you are not on the list.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.871
What list?

11:17.761 --> 11:21.674
The man who brought me here,
who brought all of my people here,

11:21.765 --> 11:24.632
he is... a magnificent man.

11:27.104 --> 11:30.346
lf Ben's so magnificent, then why
did he need one of us to save him?

11:30.440 --> 11:33.227
Ben? Ben is not...

11:36.029 --> 11:38.486
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.441
You are not on the list
because you are flawed.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.121
Because you are angry.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.287
And weak. And frightened.

11:50.711 --> 11:54.249
The more I learn about you, the more
I suspect you are not as omniscient

11:54.339 --> 11:55.954
as you'd have us believe.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.885
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

11:58.969 --> 12:02.962
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah. How could I?

12:04.808 --> 12:07.971
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.725
But you, John Locke,

12:12.816 --> 12:14.727
you I might have a fleeting memory of.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.060
But I must be confused because
the John Locke I know was para...

12:18.155 --> 12:19.315
[Danielle] Hey!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.148
Look at this.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.035
Over here. Come on.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.045
Well. Looks like we're here.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.052
- Will this work?
- Yes. Work.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.397
- Hmm.
- [chuckles]

13:37.401 --> 13:40.985
Uh... Sun... Please help.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.729
OK.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.113
[giggling]

13:49.204 --> 13:53.743
- [sniffs] Mmm. Smells great.
- Let's get it over with.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.418
- This was my mother's worst fear.
- What do you mean?

14:01.508 --> 14:05.797
That I would end up doing something
very much like this, cutting bait.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.879
She had high hopes for my future.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.556
They did not include
me marrying a fisherman's son.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.434
Well, I guess we don't always
turn out like our mothers want.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.561
Of course, mine never
worked a day in her life.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.111
My mom was a librarian.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.609
"Was?"

14:37.002 --> 14:38.788
We should get this stuff out there.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.140
[woman] Where were you?

15:04.780 --> 15:07.271
I went home to take a shower.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.732
- That must've been nice.
- They said she was still in surgery.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.738
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

15:15.832 --> 15:20.041
Well, I'm glad that
you're feeling refreshed.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.123
Good afternoon.
Are you the daughter?

15:27.928 --> 15:32.388
l'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.
I'll be observing your mother.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.180
How is she?

15:34.267 --> 15:38.306
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries, but...

15:38.396 --> 15:41.183
...your mother's suffered
a severe head trauma.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.435
We'll have to wait for
the swelling to go down

15:43.527 --> 15:46.269
before we can determine
the full extent of her injuries.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.741
But... I'm afraid we're looking at
fairly widespread damage.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.277
What does that mean?

15:56.373 --> 16:00.457
It means that right now,
these machines are sustaining her life.

16:01.545 --> 16:06.289
But, I mean, it won't always be...
When she wakes up, she won't need...

16:06.383 --> 16:08.669
I can't say with any real confidence...

16:09.719 --> 16:11.459
...that she will wake up.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.062
- Can she hear us?
- I like to think she can.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.401
How long will she be like this?

16:33.076 --> 16:35.067
Could be a day, a week, or years.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.154
We'll just have to wait and see.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.239
But she'll be well looked after.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.949
Oh, that's very nice,

16:43.044 --> 16:45.660
- but we can't pay for that.
- Don't worry.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.747
Her expenses have
already been taken care of.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.669
By whom?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.971
I've been asked to
keep that confidential.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.391
[seagulls calling]

17:20.290 --> 17:23.657
One... two...

17:23.752 --> 17:25.663
[gunfire]

17:28.882 --> 17:30.088
Oh, no!

17:34.763 --> 17:35.969
Yaaah!

17:36.056 --> 17:39.799
- Look, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, man!
- [shouting in Korean]

17:40.268 --> 17:42.759
- What is wrong with you?
- l was shooting at a boar!

17:42.854 --> 17:46.722
- I had no idea you were out here.
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.067
He's at camp. I'm sorry.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.769
- So it was just you?
- Aye, it's just me.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.606
Hunting in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

17:56.618 --> 17:58.654
l was following a boar, Claire.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.578
Oh! So it's just coincidence, then.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.573
Where is it?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.042
It got away.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.758
You don't want me to catch
the birds, do you?

18:15.845 --> 18:18.837
You and Charlie.
What's going on?

18:19.432 --> 18:22.344
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

18:36.741 --> 18:37.856
What is it?

18:38.368 --> 18:41.576
Don't touch it!
Don't even go near it.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.789
What are these pylons?

18:50.255 --> 18:52.917
What do you think they are?

18:55.218 --> 18:57.049
A security perimeter.

18:57.554 --> 19:00.296
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

19:00.390 --> 19:02.802
if anyone passed between them.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.974
It's an alarm system or a trap.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.477
Either way, we'd be safer
going around it.

19:11.568 --> 19:15.026
You're right, it was
a security perimeter.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.651
But like everything else on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.323
Of course it hasn't.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.494
If you wish to waste your time,
be my guest.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.413
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.667
There is no going around them.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.086
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.766
He appears to be telling the truth.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.938
JohnlJohn!

19:56.029 --> 19:58.520
[electrical zapping]

19:58.615 --> 20:00.105
[electrical humming]

20:00.200 --> 20:02.191
[altered voice] Thank you.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.121
[grunting]

20:15.090 --> 20:18.708
[groaning, gasping]

20:25.475 --> 20:27.306
Oh, my God.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.145
Sorry.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.195
Looks like he suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.281
Why did you do that?
We needed him!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.129
- They'd never trade him.
- You don't know that!

20:55.213 --> 20:59.331
You don't know it either. What we know
was that he shot one of his own people

20:59.426 --> 21:03.260
who didn't want to be in this situation.
I'm gonna stick with my opinion.

21:03.346 --> 21:07.214
- We could've discussed it.
- Nobody asked me when we brought him.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.297
All right.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.056
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had a... a...

21:12.147 --> 21:14.058
...a "sonic weapon fence."

21:14.149 --> 21:17.141
I didn't know he was going to die.
How would I know that?

21:17.235 --> 21:19.521
Why are you really here?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.068
Are you here for Jack?

21:22.157 --> 21:23.988
Why else would I be here?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.699
We'll talk about this later.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.654
Fine by me. Just tell me
how we're going go through this.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.490
We're not going to go through it.
We're going over it.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.873
- Sayid, where's the ax?
- In his pack.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.547
No, wait a minute,
I got it. Here, I got it.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.387
I thought you didn't know
there was any C-4.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.771
Well, I stand corrected.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.771
Why did you take it?

22:00.862 --> 22:04.775
You never know when
a little C-4 might come in handy.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.573
You'll have to do
better than that.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.914
OK, there you go.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.880
- What's going on with you, Charlie?
- Shh.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.174
- ljust put Aaron down.
- No!

22:25.261 --> 22:29.675
- You and Desmond, what's going on?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

22:29.766 --> 22:34.100
You don't know anything about Desmond
shooting his gun and scaring the birds?

22:34.187 --> 22:37.429
- I've been with Aaron all morning.
- You're lying, Charlie.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.980
I am not lying.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.852
What happened to the guy
who woke up this morning,

22:43.947 --> 22:46.359
who wanted to have a picnic
and "seize the day"?

22:46.449 --> 22:48.781
You really want to know the truth?

22:49.744 --> 22:51.700
That glint you saw could be anything,

22:51.788 --> 22:56.498
a piece of glass stuck in the bird's
foot, or it could be nothing at all.

22:58.503 --> 23:01.916
I don't want to advocate
false hope, Claire. That's all.

23:03.758 --> 23:07.421
Well, I'm sorry I bothered you
with my stupid ideas.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.877
It won't ever happen again.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.554
And Charlie, I don't want
my baby around liars.

23:11.641 --> 23:15.099
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

23:15.186 --> 23:18.519
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.392
- l was wrong.
- No. Claire!

23:20.483 --> 23:23.020
No, I'm on my own!
And at least I know that now.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.988
- Claire!
- Just go!

23:36.082 --> 23:39.415
Morning, dear.
Oh, I like your new doctor.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.584
- What new doctor?
- Oh, the American.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.836
He's in with your mum now.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.928
Excuse me...

24:07.655 --> 24:09.520
The nurse said...

24:11.200 --> 24:12.360
Are you a doctor?

24:14.245 --> 24:16.110
Yes, um...

24:19.917 --> 24:22.408
l'm... l'm... I'm very sorry,

24:22.503 --> 24:26.712
I shouldn't be disturbing you.
l was just leaving.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.128
What are you doing here?

24:30.219 --> 24:33.302
- l was just on my way out.
- lf Carole knew you were here...

24:33.389 --> 24:35.641
She'd what? What would she do?

24:35.725 --> 24:39.263
- She wouldn't act the way you are.
- [Claire] Aunt Lindsey...

24:39.854 --> 24:41.845
...what's going on here,
who is he?

24:43.441 --> 24:45.807
It doesn't matter. Just go.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.235
Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.
She deserves to know.

24:49.322 --> 24:53.565
- Please, just leave us alone.
- You are not the arbiter here.

24:53.660 --> 24:58.154
- Claire has every right to know...
- You're taking advantage of her!

24:58.247 --> 24:59.703
Just stop it!

25:01.334 --> 25:03.450
You are the one paying the bills?

25:03.544 --> 25:06.126
Are you the one
taking care of all this?

25:09.384 --> 25:10.999
Yes.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.101
Then who are you?

25:25.608 --> 25:27.223
I'm your father, Claire.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.722
The system appears
to fire a sonic pulse

26:06.816 --> 26:09.478
when an object breaks the plane
between two pylons.

26:09.569 --> 26:13.107
So, as long as we
don't break the plane,

26:13.197 --> 26:15.108
we should remain unharmed.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.235
Why not use the explosive you took?

26:17.326 --> 26:19.362
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on there?

26:20.163 --> 26:23.371
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.164
I'll go first.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.498
Give me a hand.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.689
[exhales]

27:31.901 --> 27:33.732
I guess I'll go next.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.386
[baby cooing]

28:09.480 --> 28:11.937
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

28:16.112 --> 28:20.651
- You have every right to be upset.
- It just doesn't make any sense.

28:20.741 --> 28:25.030
Desmond's never gone boar hunting and
the boar never come close to the beach.

28:25.121 --> 28:29.615
Well, whatever is going on,
they're still talking about it.

28:36.674 --> 28:39.336
- Can you watch him?
- What are you going to do?

28:42.346 --> 28:43.961
Get some answers.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.433
[door opens]

28:50.521 --> 28:52.022
I'll be with you in a sec.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.812
[door closes]

28:56.652 --> 28:58.108
There you go.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.691
That'll be ten bucks.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.832
What are you doing here?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.911
Buy you a cup of coffee?

29:19.008 --> 29:22.421
- l have nothing to say to you.
- Claire, I'm leaving tonight.

29:22.511 --> 29:26.675
Then I'll be out of your life forever.
Just... one cup of coffee.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.356
So, it's true?

29:38.486 --> 29:41.228
Yes. It's true.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.496
How did you find out
about the accident?

29:49.580 --> 29:51.491
A doctor friend in Sydney told me.

29:51.582 --> 29:55.166
I got the call... the minute
your mother went into surgery.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.296
Why did she tell me
that you were dead?

30:02.176 --> 30:06.715
Well, because I, no doubt, left her
with so many wonderful memories.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.016
Look, we had a fling.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.811
l was back in Los Angeles when
she told me that she was pregnant,

30:15.898 --> 30:18.059
that she was going to have
the baby... you.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.983
And you didn't...
you didn't want to see me?

30:21.070 --> 30:25.484
No, I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.907
I stayed over, gave you toys.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.906
I... sang to you.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.832
Why'd you stop coming?

30:37.837 --> 30:39.452
Because your aunt hates me.

30:40.047 --> 30:43.710
And your mother didn't like the fact
that I had another family.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.422
Why are you here now, then?
Why did you come?

30:47.513 --> 30:49.799
Could've paid her bills
from the States...

30:49.890 --> 30:53.018
I came over because I wanted to help.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.263
Help with what?

30:55.354 --> 30:59.142
Claire... your mother is alive...

31:01.360 --> 31:03.225
...but she's not really living.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.190
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means

31:06.282 --> 31:09.365
that now may be the time
to look at other alternatives,

31:09.452 --> 31:11.693
other ways to relieve her pain.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.991
Now, it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

31:15.082 --> 31:18.040
but I know of ways that
can achieve the same effect

31:18.127 --> 31:21.039
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

31:21.130 --> 31:23.086
You didn't come here to help me.

31:23.174 --> 31:26.962
- You came to fix a mistake you made.
- No, honey, that's not true...

31:27.053 --> 31:30.921
You thinkjust paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

31:31.015 --> 31:34.553
You come down here
and you try and get me to kill her?

31:38.981 --> 31:40.687
You know, just go.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.642
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your "real" family.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.979
You know...

31:50.659 --> 31:52.445
...you might be my father...

31:55.122 --> 31:57.329
...but I don't even know your name.

31:59.335 --> 32:02.668
And |, um... lwant it to stay that way.

32:03.839 --> 32:07.457
Claire! Claire, listen to me!
Listen to me!

32:08.636 --> 32:11.924
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.221
Now, there is hope and there is guilt.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.471
And believe me, I know the difference.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.939
Good-bye, kiddo.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.691
It was great seeing you again.

33:13.242 --> 33:15.858
What the hell are you doing?

33:15.953 --> 33:17.068
You followed me?

33:19.915 --> 33:21.291
Stay back!

33:21.876 --> 33:24.492
- It's one of the birds.
- Stay back!

33:42.938 --> 33:45.270
How did you know
it was going to be here?

33:45.357 --> 33:48.349
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

33:48.444 --> 33:52.278
You had to. That's what you
and Charlie were arguing about.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.320
You knew.

33:57.411 --> 33:58.947
- How would I?
- I don't know.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.495
But you know,
you walked straight here,

34:01.582 --> 34:03.948
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

34:04.043 --> 34:07.581
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.462
And lo and behold, there's the bird!

34:12.801 --> 34:15.383
What the hell is going on, Desmond?

34:23.145 --> 34:24.806
See that spot over there?

34:29.610 --> 34:32.317
That's where Charlie
slipped and fell in.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.692
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

34:37.159 --> 34:38.399
...broke his neck.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.360
What?

34:41.455 --> 34:43.286
What are you talking about?

34:44.792 --> 34:46.828
That's where Charlie died.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.594
Look what Desmond found.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.518
How about that?

35:07.439 --> 35:09.270
It does have a tag.

35:09.358 --> 35:10.848
You were right.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.321
Desmond told me everything.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.697
About all his visions...

35:24.581 --> 35:28.119
...that he knew you were
going to get hit by lightning...

35:30.337 --> 35:33.795
...that you were going to drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.386
How you died
trying to get me this bird.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.723
You don't believe all that, do you?

36:09.418 --> 36:11.659
Now, who turned the telly off?

36:11.754 --> 36:15.042
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

36:15.424 --> 36:17.460
[narrator on TV indistinct]

36:17.551 --> 36:19.507
That's better.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.763
So, how are you today, Mum?

36:25.392 --> 36:27.303
Did you have an OK night?

36:41.283 --> 36:42.739
There's, um...

36:44.953 --> 36:47.205
...something I have to tell you.

36:48.082 --> 36:51.370
Something I should've told you
a long time ago.

37:06.809 --> 37:09.175
l, uh... I'm giving it away.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.936
It's for... It's for the best.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.729
IWish...

37:28.539 --> 37:30.495
I don't know how you did it...

37:31.708 --> 37:34.245
...raising me alone.

37:34.670 --> 37:38.003
lt must've been so hard.

37:38.674 --> 37:41.882
And l was just... awful.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.549
Awful.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.760
So horrible to you.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.306
I'm so sorry, Mum.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.521
I'm so sorry.

38:07.494 --> 38:11.954
I'm so sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.578
That...

38:16.545 --> 38:18.786
...that I hated you.

38:18.881 --> 38:22.499
And that... lwished
you weren't my mother,

38:22.593 --> 38:25.926
and... I wished you were dead.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.134
[sobbing] It's all my fault.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.432
The accident...

38:32.519 --> 38:34.430
...and everything.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.729
[crying]

38:40.277 --> 38:42.984
I'm so sorry, Mum.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.071
I'm so sorry.

38:49.912 --> 38:51.903
I'm so sorry.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.621
I'll see you soon, OK?

39:00.005 --> 39:02.041
[Charlie] "To whom it may concern,

39:02.132 --> 39:05.624
We are survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.217
We have survived on this island
for 80 days.

39:13.060 --> 39:16.097
Six hours into the flight,
the pilot said we were off course

39:16.188 --> 39:18.770
and turned back towards Fiji.

39:20.609 --> 39:23.225
We hit turbulence and crashed.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.187
We've been waiting here
all this time,

39:27.282 --> 39:30.319
waiting for rescue that has not come.

39:31.119 --> 39:35.362
We do not know where we are,
we only know you have not found us.

39:36.792 --> 39:39.329
We've done our best
to live on this island.

39:39.419 --> 39:43.128
Some of us have come to accept
we may never leave it.

39:45.384 --> 39:49.343
Not all of us have survived
since the crash.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.920
But there is new life, too.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.882
And with it, there is hope.

39:54.977 --> 39:56.808
We are alive.

39:59.982 --> 40:02.143
Please don't give up on us."

40:02.985 --> 40:04.566
It's, uh...

40:06.196 --> 40:07.572
It's perfect, Claire.

40:16.415 --> 40:18.872
You know, I'm not giving up
on you either, Charlie.

40:22.004 --> 40:24.086
It's going to be OK.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.333
You're going to be OK.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.140
We'll get through this together.

40:49.906 --> 40:53.194
[seagulls calling]

41:21.480 --> 41:23.061
What?

41:24.858 --> 41:26.394
We're here.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.297
Jack...

42:04.147 --> 42:05.762
[man laughs]
