NARRATOR:
 Previously on East Los High.

00:02.136 --> 00:03.570
Losing your virginity
is a big deal.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.739
Are you scared?
Gina, I'm not talking about it!

00:06.006 --> 00:08.075
GINA:
 Who's the guy, do I know him?

00:08.142 --> 00:11.178
CAMILA:
 Are you deaf? I said
I don't wanna talk about it!

00:11.245 --> 00:14.615
You know it wasn't your fault?
None of it was.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.384
You're rolling the Escalade
down to San Diego on Friday.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.420
I don't wanna be part of this.
You're done...

00:20.487 --> 00:23.257
when I say you're done.
Now go get the keys.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.192
And what about Bomb Squad?
The same one

00:25.259 --> 00:28.462
that is working their butts off
to get to Regionals.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.330
Watch it!
Don't!

00:30.397 --> 00:32.099
She might be pregnant.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.434
You can all go to hell.
I quit.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.703
Bad things happen
to all of us, Gina.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.438
You gotta move on.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.441
Don't worry, I am.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.510
JACOB: Where the hell's Gina?
 She left her phone

00:43.577 --> 00:46.313
behind and got in a weird van.
 That doesn't sound like her.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.482
CAMILA: Found Amber's journal.
Well, let me see it.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.684
I don't have it.
Of course you don't.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.287
CAMILA:
 I know where it is.
 You're gonna feel really stupid

00:53.353 --> 00:55.455
whenever I get it.

 And we must warn you,

01:01.528 --> 01:03.096
some of the images
 you're about to see

01:03.163 --> 01:04.665
are extremely graphic.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.034
An unidentified body
of a young woman

01:07.100 --> 01:10.571
has been found in an abandoned
lot in East Los Angeles.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.106
Authorities are investigating
this as a homicide.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.143
The body will be transferred
 to the L.A. Coroner's Office

01:16.210 --> 01:17.578
for identification.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.479
REMY:
So what the hell
are you looking for?

01:19.546 --> 01:22.049
Huh?

01:22.115 --> 01:24.151
( cell ringing )

01:27.354 --> 01:28.522
Oh, hey, Nic.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.190
Remy?

01:30.257 --> 01:32.326
Where's Camila?

01:32.392 --> 01:35.529
You know I caught her
doing a very bad thing, Nic.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.364
Put her on.
REMY: Listen,

01:37.431 --> 01:38.699
plans have changed.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.634
I need you to deliver
the goods tonight.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.337
Tonight?
I thought you said tomorrow.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.606
You wanna argue with these guys?
'Cause I sure as hell don't.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.574
NIC:
 Put Camila on the phone,
I wanna make sure

01:47.641 --> 01:49.076
she's all right.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.091

work for free.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.261
Your paycheck.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.430
Want your paycheck?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.166
Here's your paycheck.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.601
Okay?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.504
You found it.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.045
Wait.

What?

( phone beeps )
Jocelyn, Nic.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.389
Call me back, I think
something happened to Camila.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.375
And here's...a little extra.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.576
Now come here.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.478
Get the hell off me!

03:47.794 --> 03:50.364
What do you want?
Do you know where Gina is?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.065
Isn't she at work?

03:52.132 --> 03:54.468
No, she's not. You didn't get
any of my messages?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.607
Gina?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.377
Gina?

04:03.443 --> 04:05.712
Oh, man, she's really gone.
What do you mean she's gone?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.114
Just call her.
I can't.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.382
She left her phone behind.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.784
She hopped in
a gray van with some guy.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.219
What guy?

04:12.285 --> 04:14.154
I don't know.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.190
You know her password?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.193
No, try Bomb Squad
or something.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.029
Hello?
Hey. Nic called me.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.399
He was worried about you.
You okay?

04:25.465 --> 04:27.134
No, Gina's missing.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.436
Zac said that she took a break
and never came back.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.471
Oh, shit.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.140
What?

04:33.206 --> 04:35.242
Nothing. It's fine.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.743
What?
What are you hiding?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.045
Nothing. Gina's--

04:39.112 --> 04:40.614
She's been going through
a lot lately.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.682
She probably just needs
some time alone.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.485
Does Gina have a middle name?
Yeah, "stupid" for disappearing

04:45.552 --> 04:46.720
and leaving her phone behind.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.321
( knocking on door )

04:51.324 --> 04:52.559
Please tell me you found her.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.094
Oh, my God, really?

04:54.161 --> 04:55.362
ZAC:
Not yet.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.630
I'm trying
to crack her password.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.565
Try "Diego".

04:58.632 --> 05:01.034
No.
How about "Starfighter"?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.702
How about asshole?

05:02.769 --> 05:05.338
Get the hell out of here!
You-- You don't think the girl

05:05.405 --> 05:07.340
they found by the freeway--
Would you just shut up?

05:07.407 --> 05:09.009
What are you talking about?

05:09.075 --> 05:10.744
Nothing.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.145
They found a girl's body

05:12.212 --> 05:14.648
dumped by the freeway.
What?

05:14.714 --> 05:17.751
This is all my fault.
It is your fault!

05:18.018 --> 05:19.753
And if something happens
to her, I'm gonna kill you!

05:20.020 --> 05:22.222
Diego, will you just go?
I am.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.723
DIEGO:
I'm leaving East L.A.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.192
I enlisted in the Army today.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.493
Dude, today?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.028
Will you just tell Gina--?

05:28.094 --> 05:29.262
Just get the hell out!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.398
Go! Go! Leave. Leave.

if you hear anything.

REPORTER ( on radio ):
 The L.A. police department
has positively identified

05:37.204 --> 05:39.172
the body of the young girl
found today.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.374
They have not yet released
the information to the public,

05:41.441 --> 05:43.410
pending notification
of the girl's family.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.079
The homicide department
did say that the body is that

05:46.146 --> 05:48.148
of a teenage girl from Ea--

Hey, good luck tonight, baby.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.439
God, we're gonna need it.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.074
I believe in you.
You'll be fine.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.676
I'm so nervous.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.045
If we beat Truman
we could go to Regionals.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.681
Don't be. Listen, I just
want you to focus on winning.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.317
I'll pick up Isela.
Thanks, babe.

don't we?

07:10.363 --> 07:13.033
Hey, Ceci.
Have you heard from Gina?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.534
CECI:
No, not since she quit.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.603
She's been missing
since yesterday.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.772
What?
Yeah, I know, it's weird.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.408
I'm starting
to worry about that.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.609
CECI:
Yeah.

( dramatic theme playing )

07:26.613 --> 07:28.715
What do you mean
I can't join the Army?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.051
Your test results came in.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.620
You have gonorrhea.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.355
What?

07:35.422 --> 07:38.425
You won't be able to enlist
unless you clear it up.

07:38.491 --> 07:42.228
You might want to contact
all of your sexual partners.
