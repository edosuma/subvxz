14:18.814 --> 14:22.209
It's fine. You guys relax.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.341
Is there anything I can get you?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.387
Maybe some wine?

14:26.474 --> 14:28.084
I don't drink on weeknights

14:28.128 --> 14:31.305
and I'm certainly
not gonna start now.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.697
No offence to you, Allison.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.700
I know how you love your wine.

14:39.530 --> 14:40.749
Yeah.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.887
[mellow

14:54.676 --> 14:56.852
This is very nice, Allison.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.898
You're a dear.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.595
I'm glad you like it.

15:02.336 --> 15:06.253
The sauce is a little salty,
isn't it? [scoffs]

15:10.126 --> 15:13.825
I wonder
what Bruce had for dinner.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.916
Do you think
Missy made him pork chops?

15:24.184 --> 15:26.577
Why don't you stay here tonight?

15:26.664 --> 15:28.797
Oh, nonsense.
I-I couldn't impose.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.017
No, you wouldn't be imposing.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.933
Well, I don't even have
my pills or creams.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.891
I'll run to your house
and pick up whatever you need.

15:35.978 --> 15:39.155
- I don't know.
- Mom, I insist.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.679
Jimmy, you, you haven't
even asked Allison.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.029
I mean,
I'm sure she doesn't want

15:43.116 --> 15:44.682
the burden of company right now.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.641
Oh, Allison doesn't mind, right?

15:47.511 --> 15:50.253
No, of course not.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.429
You're welcome to stay
as long as you want.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.778
Oh.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.395
I do work in here sometimes.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.788
I can move my stuff if you like.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.183
Please. My mind
is cluttered enough already.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.316
I can't bear a cluttered room.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.883
Who's Charlie?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.147
[Allison] Just a friend.

16:14.234 --> 16:18.716
I-I, I never denied him sex,
you know?

16:18.803 --> 16:21.676
Not once in 38 years.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.679
Oh.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.118
I can't imagine what you
must be going through, Claire.

16:31.555 --> 16:36.212
It wouldn't kill you
to call me mom just once.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.172
Oh. I'm, I'm sorry.

16:39.259 --> 16:43.263
Don't mind me. I'm just
still getting my bearings.

16:43.350 --> 16:47.093
I understand.
I-it's gonna take some time.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.487
Um, Jim will be back soon
with your things,

16:50.574 --> 16:53.621
and, um, there's fresh towels
on the bed.

16:53.708 --> 16:57.538
Get yourself settled and let me
know if you need anything.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.585
[door shuts]

17:01.672 --> 17:04.371
[sighs] What a mess.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.464
[knocking on door]

17:10.550 --> 17:11.682
Yeah?

17:13.902 --> 17:15.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.951
[sighs]

17:20.039 --> 17:22.737
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:24.347 --> 17:28.699
You wanna talk about
what's going on

17:28.786 --> 17:30.745
with your grandparents?

17:30.832 --> 17:32.747
I don't know.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.576
I mean,
it's all just really weird.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.405
I mean, why would pop-pop
do that to grandma?

17:40.885 --> 17:43.105
- I don't know, honey.
- [door shuts]

17:43.192 --> 17:46.065
Adults don't always
behave rationally.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.375
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.551
I was just gonna wash
these sheets and towels.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.770
Well, those are all clean.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.164
Uh, they seem a little dusty.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.991
You know my allergies.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.298
Okay, um,
let me wash them for you.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.257
No, you've done enough already.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.955
And I'm very particular
about my laundry.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.392
- Do you have fabric softener?
- Yeah.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.265
Is it that generic stuff?

18:12.352 --> 18:15.311
Mm, I don't remember the brand.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.487
Well, I'll make due.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.880
And do you have any laundry

18:18.967 --> 18:20.534
you'd like grandma
to do for you, Sydney?

18:20.621 --> 18:22.318
Oh, uh, no, thank you, grandma.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.843
What about a snack?
You barely touched dinner.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.802
It seemed like
you didn't care for it.

18:27.889 --> 18:31.153
Um, yeah, sure.
I'm a little hungry.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.676
Sydney can make her own snack.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.504
You really should
take it easy, Claire.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.594
These hands were not meant
to be idle.

18:37.681 --> 18:38.987
Fridge looked pretty bare,

18:39.030 --> 18:41.337
but grandma will whip you up
something yummy.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.252
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.472
Oh, and where
are your cleaning supplies?

18:45.559 --> 18:47.126
Under the kitchen sink.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.826
Uh, what is it
you need to clean?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.355
[Bruce on voicemail]
Bruce Palmer here.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.096
Unless you're trying
to sell me something,

19:01.183 --> 19:02.663
leave a message.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.665
Dad, what the hell is going on?

19:06.057 --> 19:08.016
Call me as soon as you can.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.457
I always thought
my dad and I were really close.

19:14.544 --> 19:18.331
Now, all of a sudden, I feel
like I don't even know him.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.117
It's gotta be
some fleeting thing.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.250
I mean, he-he's gotta come back,
right?

19:24.337 --> 19:27.514
I mean,
my mom does everything for him.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.345
Yeah, I hope so.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.878
[scrubbing]

19:50.189 --> 19:53.192
[eerie music]

20:03.680 --> 20:06.553
[scrubbing continues]

20:08.772 --> 20:09.904
Mm...

20:12.863 --> 20:14.082
Grandma?

20:17.564 --> 20:20.175
Ah. Hi, honey.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.873
Um, what are you doing?

20:22.960 --> 20:25.224
Oh, I don't know.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.749
Just keeping my mind
off your grandfather, I guess.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.274
This floor needed it.

20:32.361 --> 20:36.322
Between you and I, this whole
house needs a good scrubbing.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.455
You don't need to do that,
grandma. You should go to sleep.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.414
I like doing it.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.112
I'm gonna be taking care
of a lot of things around here

20:44.199 --> 20:46.462
for you and your dad

20:46.549 --> 20:48.856
and your mom.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.292
I'm really glad
that you're here.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.513
Have no fear, grandma's here.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.992
[chuckling]

20:55.036 --> 20:57.125
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, dear.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.394
[intense music]

21:25.240 --> 21:26.285
Hm.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.684
Ah, must be nice
sleeping in like that.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.470
It's 7 a.m.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.688
Breakfast is on the table.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.865
Dig in before it gets too cold.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.780
I don't really eat breakfast.
Thank you, though.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.435
Well, that's what
Sydney said, hm?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.524
This is the best breakfast
I've ever had, grandma.

21:48.568 --> 21:51.701
Yeah. It is the most important
meal of the day.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.182
Well, all three of them
are important,

21:54.269 --> 21:57.707
but we'll call it
a three-way tie.

21:57.794 --> 22:01.624
The girl needed it.
She is wasting away.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.585
Oh, I guess you didn't know

22:05.672 --> 22:08.109
that condiments expire.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.546
Most people don't.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.505
No, I don't.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.511
[footsteps approaching]

22:22.123 --> 22:23.559
It smells delicious in here.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.127
- Aw, good morning, sweetie.
- Hey.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.737
- You didn't have to do all this.
- Well...

22:27.781 --> 22:30.218
Somebody's gotta take care
of you guys.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.264
Ooh, look at my little boy
all grown up.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.484
Did you iron my shirts
last night?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.399
Of course I did.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.575
I snuck in
while you two were sleeping.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.403
[laughing]

22:41.490 --> 22:43.274
Oh, and don't worry, Allison.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.277
Your snoring
will be our little secret.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.585
Although, you might wanna
get that checked out.

22:49.629 --> 22:53.720
I know an excellent doctor
who helped my friend's husband.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.723
Saved their marriage.
Eat, mister.

23:00.770 --> 23:04.208
So how do you like that coffee?

23:05.688 --> 23:08.082
I prefer it a little stronger.

23:08.169 --> 23:11.259
It's decaf.
Bet you didn't know that.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.611
No, I didn't.

23:15.655 --> 23:19.659
I would love to help you
kick the caffeine habit.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.139
You drink far too much.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.228
It's giving you wrinkles.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.236
- It's a double shot, right?
- Yeah.

23:37.894 --> 23:41.158
[Claire] So I feel like a fool.

23:41.245 --> 23:44.597
Call me old-fashioned.

23:46.033 --> 23:49.079
So I feel like a fool.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.735
Call me...

23:52.822 --> 23:55.521
old-fashioned.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.349
I thought
he still considered me,

23:58.437 --> 24:01.657
well, [sniffles] sexy.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.008
[scoffs]
How embarrassing is that?

24:05.095 --> 24:09.012
I thought
he, he still considered me...

24:09.099 --> 24:11.624
well, sexy.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.627
How embarrassing is that?

24:16.150 --> 24:18.108
Don't say that, Claire.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.154
You're a beautiful woman.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.331
Bless your heart, Will.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.464
But I know you're just saying
that to make me feel better.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.075
No, I'm not. You're gorgeous.

24:28.162 --> 24:32.035
- [sighs] Do you have a tissue?
- Oh, sure, of course.

24:32.122 --> 24:35.909
- Sorry.
- Oh. Thank you.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.999
No, I, I feel like an old car

24:39.042 --> 24:42.045
that, that Bruce got sick of.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.918
Everybody always wants
the new model, you know?

24:44.961 --> 24:48.748
Claire, [chuckles] you're gonna
have to stop that kind of talk.

24:48.835 --> 24:52.795
You are the most incredible
person I've ever met.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.538
- Really?
- Yes, really.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.018
Have you heard from him?

24:59.846 --> 25:02.892
I-I wanna do something for you.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.416
Well, maybe there's something
you could do.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.070
Name it. It's done.

25:07.114 --> 25:09.246
I don't want to get you
in trouble, though.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.858
I'm a big boy.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.555
It's not about Bruce.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.863
It's, it's Allison.

25:16.950 --> 25:20.301
I'm afraid
she might be up to something.

25:20.388 --> 25:23.260
Allison? [chuckles] Like, what?

25:23.347 --> 25:27.743
Well, I caught a glimpse
of a message on her computer

25:27.830 --> 25:30.093
from some man named Charlie.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.225
I got the impression

25:31.312 --> 25:35.229
that they meetregularly.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.449
Well, I mean,
maybe it's someone from work.

25:38.493 --> 25:41.888
Well, she said
it was just a friend.

25:41.975 --> 25:45.500
But who says somebody's
just a friend unless they're,

25:45.587 --> 25:48.068
well, something
more than a friend?

25:54.204 --> 25:58.078
Okay. I'll look into it.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.907
Yes.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.039
Hopefully, it's just nothing.

26:50.086 --> 26:53.786
Oh, I didn't know you were here.
Rough day?

26:53.829 --> 26:56.963
Sydney wanted
her grandma's famous chili.

26:57.006 --> 26:59.966
Uh, Thursday night
is pizza night.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.317
Pizza?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.841
- Every week?
- Yup.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.844
Well, I'm not one to break
family traditions,

27:08.931 --> 27:10.846
even unhealthy ones,

27:10.933 --> 27:13.980
but I think Sydney's got
her heart set on chili.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.986
Isn't he adorable?

27:21.857 --> 27:25.339
We stopped by and picked up
a few things today at my house.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.647
Ooh...

27:32.694 --> 27:34.957
Let me tell you, Allison.

27:35.044 --> 27:39.396
As soon as I walked in,
I just, I started bawling.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.182
Oh, hey. It's okay.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.751
Oh, I'm so immature.

27:45.838 --> 27:49.102
I just don't think I can
ever go back to that house.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.192
[mellow music]

27:57.501 --> 27:59.678
My dad finally texted me back.

28:01.288 --> 28:02.550
Wha-what did he say?

28:02.637 --> 28:05.684
Well, it was weird.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.556
Really impersonal.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.473
Said he needed space.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.041
I told him
I was embarrassed for him.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.043
Uh, he didn't respond
to that one.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.874
You think
I should text my dad again?

28:24.615 --> 28:26.052
Not right now.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.707
They're sleeping.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.885
We'll be real quiet.

28:48.161 --> 28:51.077
[instrumental music]

28:59.433 --> 29:02.436
[gasping]

29:03.393 --> 29:04.438
Mom...

29:06.396 --> 29:08.572
Oh, she's sleepwalking.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.923
She used to do this when
she got really stressed out.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.404
We're not supposed
to wake her up.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.061
Come on.

29:30.203 --> 29:34.033
Every single thing I do,
she tears it apart.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.731
I mean, I don't take care of Jim
and Sydney properly,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.864
I, I work too much,
I drink too much,

29:38.951 --> 29:43.216
I don't do the dishes or clean
or do the laundry properly.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.262
It's all so sexist. It just,
it makes me wanna scream.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.918
And the Leprechauns. Did I
tell you about the Leprechauns?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.006
[Charlie] You did.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.834
Have you, uh, I don't know,

29:52.921 --> 29:54.923
talked to her about any of this?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.013
That's a no.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.536
[Allison] You don't think
I should just,

29:59.623 --> 30:01.582
you know, try to keep the peace,

30:01.669 --> 30:04.193
um, for the next few months
until we move away?

30:04.280 --> 30:05.412
You need to stand up to her.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.023
- Before it's too late.
- Yeah.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.764
Put this crazy lady
in her place.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.287
Mm-hmm.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.159
Okay.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.162
I can do that.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.517
I will let you know how it goes.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.133
Hm.

30:32.613 --> 30:35.659
[instrumental music]

30:37.183 --> 30:40.142
[dramatic music]

31:07.213 --> 31:08.692
Mm-hmm...

31:16.657 --> 31:18.224
[door opens]

31:23.882 --> 31:25.144
[Allison] Hi, Claire.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.581
Oh, Allison.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.236
Don't you just love this frame?

31:30.279 --> 31:32.978
Uh, where'd our family photo go?

31:33.065 --> 31:35.284
Oh, I changed it for this one.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.156
Why did you do that?

31:37.243 --> 31:40.768
Well, I just love this picture
so much,

31:40.811 --> 31:43.945
and I've been so sad lately,

31:44.032 --> 31:46.426
it just makes me feel better
to see it.

31:48.123 --> 31:52.562
But I can change
the other one back, if you like.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.479
Yes. Please do that.

31:56.523 --> 31:59.830
Of course. It's your house.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.443
Wait, Claire, um,
I'd like to talk to you.

32:03.486 --> 32:04.923
Let's sit down.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.279
First of all...

32:14.802 --> 32:16.804
I understand
what you're going through.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.849
And I can't imagine

32:18.937 --> 32:22.331
how disorienting
this must all be for you.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.639
And I'm happy to have you here.

32:26.683 --> 32:30.513
- You are?
- Yes. Of course.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.690
But, um, I just think

32:33.734 --> 32:36.171
it would be better for everyone

32:36.258 --> 32:40.393
if you could just try
to adapt a little

32:40.480 --> 32:42.830
to the way we do things
around here.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.180
- Adapt?
- Yeah.

32:45.224 --> 32:48.836
You know,
you don't have to do so much.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.273
You should relax.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.622
Relax?

32:54.102 --> 32:57.627
Yeah, we have a certain way
of doing things,

32:57.714 --> 32:59.499
and it would just be s...

33:00.282 --> 33:01.501
Claire?

33:07.289 --> 33:11.424
Uh! [sighs]

33:11.467 --> 33:14.383
It's not up to me. Maybe
you finish your homework first.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.037
- I don't have any.
- You have to ask your mom.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.952
She has fallen sick.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.562
You're home early.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.260
- What's wrong?
- [footsteps approaching]

33:21.347 --> 33:22.565
[dramatic music]

33:22.652 --> 33:24.263
Mom?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.265
Mom, what are you doing?

33:26.352 --> 33:28.441
What's wrong, grandma?

33:28.528 --> 33:31.400
Can you show me how to call
an Uber, sweetheart?

33:31.487 --> 33:34.229
I think it's best
I not drive right now.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.536
Where are you going, mom?
What's goin' on?

33:36.623 --> 33:38.190
Ask Allison.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.802
Claire, I didn't say anyth...

33:41.889 --> 33:44.718
It seems my being here
has become a burden.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.721
And that's the last thing
I wanted.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.115
I was just trying to help.

33:50.202 --> 33:54.597
But... Allison is right,
this is her house.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.774
And it's time
that I went back to my own home.

33:57.861 --> 34:01.735
I didn't say anything like that
at all.

34:01.778 --> 34:04.477
[sobbing]

34:04.564 --> 34:06.783
I don't want
to be alive anymore.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.784
[Jim] Oh, don't say that, mom.
Please don't say that.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.658
Everything's gonna be okay,
grandma. Please don't leave.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.703
[Claire sobbing]

34:13.790 --> 34:15.096
Uh!

34:15.183 --> 34:18.056
[Claire sobbing]

34:25.889 --> 34:28.239
[mumbling]

34:31.373 --> 34:32.592
[door opens]

34:32.679 --> 34:33.940
[door shuts]

34:37.335 --> 34:39.467
What the hell
did you say to her?

34:39.512 --> 34:42.601
I told her that she should
relax, and, you know,

34:42.688 --> 34:45.909
just try to go with the flow
around here.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.128
What does that even mean?

34:47.172 --> 34:50.304
It means that we have a routine

34:50.349 --> 34:52.177
and she's welcome
to be a part of it.

34:52.219 --> 34:53.873
- But I'd like to stick to it.
- Jesus, Allison.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.702
She is just trying to help out.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.399
The man she's been with
most of her life's out there

34:57.486 --> 34:59.619
with some other woman.
Think about how that feels.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.664
I have thought about
how that feels.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.493
- And I told her that.
- What else did you tell her?

35:04.537 --> 35:06.669
- That's it.
- That's it.

35:06.713 --> 35:09.542
Yes. That's it, Jim.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.805
Do you think I'm lying?

35:12.806 --> 35:15.678
[Allison sighs]

35:15.765 --> 35:17.158
[cat meows]

35:17.202 --> 35:19.117
That was adorable.

35:20.683 --> 35:23.773
Sydney, you always know
how to cheer me up.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.297
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

35:29.257 --> 35:31.955
Tell me, how are you feeling

35:31.999 --> 35:35.002
about this big move to New York?

35:35.045 --> 35:37.874
Um... I don't know.

35:37.918 --> 35:42.009
I mean, it's kind of exciting,
but it's kind of scary.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.316
Hm. Of course it is.

35:44.403 --> 35:47.014
You have
so many nice friends here.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.016
Well, mom says
I'll make new friends.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.019
Plus, we'll still come back
and visit, so...

35:52.106 --> 35:53.586
Hm.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.414
[dramatic music]

35:55.501 --> 35:57.720
What?

35:57.764 --> 36:00.897
Well, it's just you'll be going
into high school, and...

36:00.984 --> 36:04.901
I hate to say this,
but teenage girls,

36:04.945 --> 36:08.992
they just love to find
somebody new to pick on.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.909
But I'm sure your mom's right.

36:12.996 --> 36:16.696
You are so sweet.
Who would wanna do that?

36:24.704 --> 36:28.534
Well, part of the problem is
that I have kept my mouth shut

36:28.577 --> 36:31.363
for too long
about too many things.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.799
So what things
are you talkin' about?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.410
Just a bunch of little things.

36:35.454 --> 36:36.933
Like, what?

36:37.020 --> 36:39.762
Like, comments
about me not being good enough.

36:39.806 --> 36:42.809
Oh, she doesn't mean it. That is
how she is with everyone.

36:42.896 --> 36:46.987
No, that is not how she is
with everyone.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.771
And she always just feels like

36:48.815 --> 36:51.252
it's okay to stop by
unannounced.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.081
Always.

36:54.168 --> 36:57.345
You didn't even ask me before
you gave her a key to the house.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.130
And that was how long ago?

37:00.174 --> 37:02.785
Y-y-you never said
you had a problem with it.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.961
No, you're right. I didn't.
And I should have.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.486
You never complained
about the free babysitting

37:07.573 --> 37:09.357
or how she looks after the house
when we're out of town,

37:09.444 --> 37:12.578
also for free. I bet you'll miss
that when we're in New York.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.754
All right, let's just stop

37:14.797 --> 37:16.103
because you're not hearing me,
Jim.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.583
Yes, let's stop. Great idea.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.411
You know what,
I'm gonna take a shower.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.632
[door opens]

37:23.676 --> 37:24.938
[door shuts]

37:28.028 --> 37:29.595
[door opens]

37:32.032 --> 37:33.251
[Allison] Hey.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.386
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.957
- How long has she been asleep?
- Not long.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.003
I should wake her.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.527
She'll probably
be more comfortable in...

37:48.614 --> 37:50.137
Just leave her alone.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.806
[dramatic music]

38:15.684 --> 38:18.121
[mumbling]

38:21.168 --> 38:23.388
Well...

38:23.475 --> 38:24.780
I've got good news.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.739
- Yeah?
- Uh...

38:28.567 --> 38:29.916
Yes?

38:30.003 --> 38:33.398
Uh, Charlie turns out to be

38:33.485 --> 38:34.834
Charlene Cansfield.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.445
She's a woman,
she's Allison's friend,

38:37.532 --> 38:39.665
and they have lunch together.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.625
Oh.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.801
What's the matter? I thought
you'd be happy at that news.

38:45.888 --> 38:49.152
Oh. Of course, I am. I...

38:49.239 --> 38:53.331
Well, as happy as I can be
these days.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.858
You know, Claire,

38:58.901 --> 39:03.166
you look, um,
you look really nice today.

39:05.473 --> 39:08.868
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I just...
Whoa.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.784
Oh, God,
you don't ever have to apologize

39:11.871 --> 39:15.004
for paying me a compliment,
cutie.

39:16.441 --> 39:20.662
Well, ahem,
the good news is that, uh,

39:20.749 --> 39:23.578
not likely that Allison
is sneaking around on Jim.

39:23.665 --> 39:26.276
But this, uh, Charlie lady,
on the other hand,

39:26.364 --> 39:28.714
that's a totally different
story.

39:28.801 --> 39:31.064
Oh? Do tell.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.849
Yeah, well,
I saw her playing kissy face

39:33.936 --> 39:35.590
with the, uh, pool guy

39:35.677 --> 39:38.593
in spite of the wedding band
on her finger.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.335
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.079
I don't even own a pool.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.124
I guess
I'm doing something wrong.

39:48.211 --> 39:51.040
You're adorable. [chuckles]

39:51.084 --> 39:53.739
[dramatic music]

39:53.826 --> 39:55.871
Oh, this is my lucky day.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.264
What's that?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.926
Will you excuse me a moment,
Will?

40:07.013 --> 40:08.362
Of course.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.065
Mariah, is that you?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.590
- Claire?
- How are you?

40:18.677 --> 40:21.027
So good to see you.
It's been so long.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.464
Oh. Look at you!

40:23.508 --> 40:25.684
More beautiful than ever.

40:25.771 --> 40:28.948
I always said you and Jim
made the most gorgeous couple

40:28.991 --> 40:30.340
I've ever seen.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.995
You're too sweet. How is Jim?

40:33.039 --> 40:36.738
He's great.
I know he'd love to see you.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.740
- You have to come for dinner.
- No.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.568
Yes.
I won't take no for an answer.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.875
[chuckles] Okay.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.354
Then I won't say no.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.053
Perfect. Perfect.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.446
See you.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.928
[instrumental music]

40:55.148 --> 40:57.803
[Claire laughing]

40:57.890 --> 40:59.369
[child on video]
Oh, my goodness, you...

40:59.457 --> 41:02.068
- [all laughing]
- [cat meows]

41:02.155 --> 41:04.113
[child on video]
Oh, laser for you.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.948
- Gross, guys.
- What was that for?

41:13.035 --> 41:16.038
- Well, I missed you.
- Really?

41:16.082 --> 41:18.563
Mm, I thought about some of
the things you said last night,

41:18.650 --> 41:20.565
and I think you were right.

41:20.652 --> 41:23.132
I wasn't really listening
to you, and I'm sorry.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.787
Thank you.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.007
Dinner's going to be ready soon.

41:28.094 --> 41:30.183
Oh, I already ate.

41:30.270 --> 41:31.489
Hm.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.535
I'm gonna go take a bath.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.538
- Allison?
- Yeah?

41:37.625 --> 41:42.238
Uh, next time maybe you could
tell me if you eat elsewhere.

41:42.282 --> 41:45.546
- I just hate to waste food.
- I mean, she's a big girl, mom.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.940
Big girls have good manners.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.724
I hope that was supposed to be
a joke rather we don't...

41:49.768 --> 41:52.335
Don't say stuff like that, mom,
please.

41:54.120 --> 41:57.602
Sure, Claire.
I'll let you know next time.

41:57.689 --> 42:00.213
And there's nothing wrong
with leftovers.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.347
Bruce loved leftovers.

42:04.391 --> 42:06.262
[dramatic music]

42:06.349 --> 42:08.177
You mean loves them, right?

42:08.264 --> 42:10.136
He's not dead, mom.

42:12.747 --> 42:15.707
[music continues]

42:21.408 --> 42:24.411
[moaning]

42:32.462 --> 42:33.725
What's wrong?

42:35.291 --> 42:38.033
- Nothing.
- You sure?

42:38.120 --> 42:39.426
Why are we whispering?

42:39.469 --> 42:41.863
Because I don't want
interruptions this time.

42:43.952 --> 42:45.432
[doorknob rattling]

42:45.475 --> 42:47.521
- What was that?
- Nothing.

42:52.178 --> 42:54.572
[doorknob rattling]

42:54.659 --> 42:57.792
Okay. I heard that, uh...

42:57.836 --> 43:00.926
Sydney should be in bed by now.
I'll check.

43:11.023 --> 43:13.939
[doorknob rattling]

43:16.811 --> 43:19.771
[intense music]

43:20.815 --> 43:21.903
[gasps]

43:23.426 --> 43:25.472
[Jim] Oh, my God. Mom.

43:25.515 --> 43:26.734
Jim.

43:30.782 --> 43:32.784
Come, mom, to bed.

43:36.875 --> 43:38.790
[doorbell rings]

43:42.097 --> 43:44.883
- Hello? Can I help you?
- Hello.

43:44.970 --> 43:48.451
Um, I'm sorry to bother you,
I-it's just...

43:48.538 --> 43:51.803
I used to live in this house
a long time ago,

43:51.890 --> 43:56.285
back when my, my dear Richard
was still living.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.724
I, uh, I just had
the most perfect life here.

43:59.767 --> 44:03.553
How nice. We love it here, too.
I'm Charlie.

44:03.597 --> 44:05.860
Oh, it's nice to meet you,
Charlie.

44:05.904 --> 44:08.210
My name's Marilyn.

44:08.297 --> 44:12.084
Would you... like
to take a look inside?

44:12.171 --> 44:14.869
- Well, maybe just a little peek.
- Come on in.

44:14.956 --> 44:18.438
[gasps] Oh, I love what
you've done with this space.

44:18.525 --> 44:20.745
Oh, well, this is how it was
when we moved in.

44:20.832 --> 44:22.877
We're getting ready
to redo everything.

44:22.964 --> 44:25.488
[Claire] Make it your own.
That's good.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.012
Ah.

44:31.016 --> 44:32.670
How nice.

44:32.757 --> 44:34.933
Is he your son?

44:35.020 --> 44:37.065
Um, no.

44:37.152 --> 44:39.024
He's our pool guy.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.463
Is he even 18? Hm?

44:43.550 --> 44:47.467
Don't tell me you're breaking
child labor laws, Charlie.

44:47.554 --> 44:51.427
Bradley's 25.
Everything's on the up and up.

44:51.514 --> 44:52.777
Twenty five.

44:52.864 --> 44:55.867
Mm. Still a baby.

44:55.954 --> 44:59.218
Oh, I lovethese countertops.

45:01.786 --> 45:04.702
Hm. Your children?

45:04.789 --> 45:06.878
Yes. Ten and seven.

45:07.792 --> 45:09.141
Cherish them.

45:09.228 --> 45:10.882
Before you know it,
they'll be all grown-up

45:10.969 --> 45:13.319
and you won't know what to do
with yourself.

45:13.406 --> 45:14.842
Take it from me.

45:14.929 --> 45:16.583
Yes. That must be tough.

45:16.670 --> 45:19.934
Mm-hmm. I have the best son
in the whole world.

45:20.021 --> 45:22.676
He treats me like a queen.

45:22.763 --> 45:25.592
The only problem is his wife.

45:25.635 --> 45:28.595
Oh? What's the problem?

45:28.638 --> 45:30.162
Well, sometimes I worry

45:30.249 --> 45:34.209
she's just a no-good,
dirty bitch.

45:34.296 --> 45:38.257
She's ungrateful, disrespectful.

45:38.344 --> 45:41.303
[sighs] Some people
seem to think she's pretty,

45:41.390 --> 45:43.088
but I don't see it.

45:43.175 --> 45:44.916
She drinks too much.

45:45.003 --> 45:47.179
She's a lackluster mother

45:47.266 --> 45:49.703
and she's probably
a frigid wife.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.532
Oh, yes.

45:52.619 --> 45:54.534
You know her.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.536
Well,
what are you talking about?

45:58.712 --> 46:00.714
I told a little lie.

46:00.801 --> 46:03.021
It was very exciting.

46:03.108 --> 46:06.938
Uh, m-my name's
not really Marilyn.

46:07.025 --> 46:08.722
It's Claire.

46:08.809 --> 46:11.464
My daughter-in-law's name
is Allison.

46:12.944 --> 46:14.293
Not surprisingly,

46:14.380 --> 46:17.775
her own parents
are a couple of deadbeats

46:17.862 --> 46:20.299
who couldn't even pay
for the wedding.

46:20.386 --> 46:24.433
Allison almost talked Jim
into eloping.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.786
Luckily, I got wind of that
and I took care of everything.

46:28.873 --> 46:31.919
It was beautiful!

46:32.006 --> 46:33.442
[Claire sighs]

46:33.529 --> 46:35.357
But do you think she thanked me?

46:35.444 --> 46:39.840
Oh, yes, she thanked me,
but she didn't mean it.

46:39.927 --> 46:43.148
She resented it.
She resented me.

46:45.367 --> 46:48.196
Wow. [scoffs]

46:48.240 --> 46:50.590
I knew you must be crazy,

46:50.677 --> 46:52.810
but I had noidea.

46:53.593 --> 46:55.290
Poor Allison.

46:56.248 --> 46:58.772
This explains a lot.

47:00.034 --> 47:01.470
Hm.

47:01.557 --> 47:04.169
It's time for you to go, Claire.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.521
How did it start
between you two?

47:11.741 --> 47:13.091
Excuse me?

47:13.178 --> 47:15.920
You and-and Bradley.

47:16.007 --> 47:19.358
[sighs] Bit tawdry, isn't it,
sleeping with the help?

47:21.403 --> 47:22.622
I don't know
what you're talking about.

47:22.709 --> 47:25.712
Oh. Listen, I get it.

47:25.799 --> 47:29.934
I mean, I-I slept
with the same man for 38 years.

47:30.021 --> 47:32.458
Don't get me wrong,
I'm no prude.

47:32.545 --> 47:35.722
But after a while,
it's like, "Enough is enough,"

47:35.765 --> 47:38.551
and you just, you just want
to shove your husband

47:38.594 --> 47:41.119
into the nearest freezer.

47:41.206 --> 47:43.208
You need to go now!

47:46.428 --> 47:48.735
Does David know?

47:48.778 --> 47:52.478
Well,
h-how about Stella and Jack?

47:52.565 --> 47:56.569
Do they know about mommy's
special friend, Bradley?

47:59.572 --> 48:02.836
My Bruce was a detective.

48:02.923 --> 48:06.971
His ex-partner
is still on the job.

48:07.058 --> 48:09.364
He has a little crush on me.

48:09.451 --> 48:11.062
And my, oh, my,

48:11.149 --> 48:14.195
did he dig up some dirt on you,
girl.

48:14.282 --> 48:16.241
[chuckles]

48:18.373 --> 48:21.507
Don't worry,
the last thing I want to do

48:21.594 --> 48:23.596
is break up a family.

48:23.683 --> 48:26.599
There's no need
for that to happen. Hm?

48:28.688 --> 48:31.778
I just need a little favor,
that's all.

48:31.865 --> 48:33.911
[dramatic music]

48:39.090 --> 48:41.831
So anything new
with your mother-in-law?

48:41.919 --> 48:44.399
Well, she showed up
in our bedroom last night,

48:44.486 --> 48:47.054
right when Jim and I
were about to have sex again.

48:47.141 --> 48:51.145
And, supposedly,
she was sleepwalking.

48:51.232 --> 48:52.755
I don't know why,
like, I feel like

48:52.842 --> 48:55.106
she might be doing it
on purpose.

48:56.063 --> 48:57.804
Well, that seems...

48:58.979 --> 49:01.025
pretty far-fetched.

49:01.068 --> 49:02.983
Well, I don't know,
it seems to me like

49:03.070 --> 49:05.420
everything she does
is calculated.

49:05.507 --> 49:08.858
And she is the master
of manipulation.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.904
She will provoke me on purpose

49:10.991 --> 49:12.514
and then play the victim
if I bite...

49:12.601 --> 49:14.647
Are you,
are you expecting a phone call?

49:15.517 --> 49:16.954
What?

49:17.041 --> 49:19.347
You keep looking at your phone.

49:19.434 --> 49:22.524
[Charlie] N-no, no.
I'm, I'm sorry.

49:22.611 --> 49:25.049
I-I'm just thinking

49:25.136 --> 49:27.268
of how to put this.

49:27.355 --> 49:29.401
Oh?

49:29.488 --> 49:33.666
There's only... one way
to say it.

49:36.625 --> 49:37.670
You're starting to sound

49:37.757 --> 49:41.500
like a real bitch, Allison.

49:42.936 --> 49:44.677
W-what?

49:45.678 --> 49:47.593
I'm sorry...

49:47.680 --> 49:49.595
but think about it.

49:49.682 --> 49:52.380
Look, this woman's husband
just ran out on her,

49:52.467 --> 49:54.382
and you're mad about what?

49:54.426 --> 49:56.863
Her doing the cooking,
cleaning the house

49:56.906 --> 49:58.821
and sleepwalking?

49:58.908 --> 50:01.346
No. No. I mean...

50:01.433 --> 50:04.131
Haven't you heard anything
I've said?

50:04.218 --> 50:07.700
Yes. I've heard everything
you've said.

50:09.484 --> 50:12.487
But when's the last time
you listened to me?

50:12.574 --> 50:13.749
I mean, when's the last time
you asked

50:13.836 --> 50:16.404
about David and the kids?

50:16.491 --> 50:20.408
Oh, we talk about your family
a-all the time.

50:20.452 --> 50:24.499
Not nearly as much
as we talk about you.

50:24.586 --> 50:28.199
It's allabout you lately,
Allison.

50:29.591 --> 50:32.203
[mellow music]

50:32.290 --> 50:34.770
Really? Really?

50:34.857 --> 50:36.903
Yes. Really.

50:42.909 --> 50:43.997
All right.

50:44.084 --> 50:47.827
Well, um, if that's the case...

50:47.914 --> 50:50.830
I am so sorry, so sorry.

50:53.746 --> 50:57.315
Do you know how disinterested
David's mom is in our lives?

50:57.402 --> 51:00.231
I would love it
if she cared half as much

51:00.318 --> 51:02.059
as your mother-in-law does.

51:04.322 --> 51:06.672
What is going on with you?

51:06.759 --> 51:10.893
You have never said anything
to me like this ever before.

51:10.980 --> 51:13.287
And now, all of a sudden,
what, is this all just been

51:13.374 --> 51:16.073
a-a-a setup for this moment?

51:18.162 --> 51:21.817
Not everyone is out to get you,
Allison.

51:21.904 --> 51:23.906
And stop being paranoid.

51:23.993 --> 51:26.039
Paranoid?

51:26.126 --> 51:28.824
Paranoid? Really?

51:28.868 --> 51:32.959
[scoffs] You know, you were
supposed to be my friend!

51:35.309 --> 51:37.703
I am your friend.

51:40.271 --> 51:42.490
I'm actually your only friend

51:42.577 --> 51:45.537
because you drive
everyone else away.

51:49.541 --> 51:52.109
Okay. Okay.

52:05.557 --> 52:08.473
[dramatic music]

52:37.850 --> 52:39.417
[sighs]

52:40.374 --> 52:41.723
[Claire laughing]

52:41.767 --> 52:42.724
[Claire] Sorry about that.

52:42.811 --> 52:44.161
[Sydney] It's okay.

52:46.337 --> 52:49.166
- [Claire] Do you get...
- [Sydney chuckling]

52:52.343 --> 52:55.041
Hello! How was your day?

52:55.084 --> 52:57.913
Huh. Not great.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.873
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

53:02.309 --> 53:04.268
Don't forget, Sydney.

53:04.355 --> 53:07.662
- We're going out later tonight.
- Do I have to?

53:07.749 --> 53:10.274
You most certainly do,
young lady.

53:10.361 --> 53:13.190
And don't speak that way to her.

53:13.277 --> 53:15.104
I think it's wonderful
that the two of you

53:15.192 --> 53:16.932
still have
mother-daughter dates.

53:17.019 --> 53:19.805
[chuckles] Don't call it a date.
It's weird.

53:19.892 --> 53:21.894
There is nothing weird

53:21.981 --> 53:25.202
about spending quality time
with your mother.

53:25.289 --> 53:26.899
You understand?

53:28.161 --> 53:30.381
Yeah. I understand.

53:31.382 --> 53:32.383
Good.

53:35.124 --> 53:39.085
So... are you excited
about the concert

53:39.172 --> 53:40.739
with your dad next week?

53:40.826 --> 53:44.569
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

53:44.612 --> 53:47.049
Oh. Don't forget to bring
your bathing suit.

53:47.136 --> 53:49.922
Dad says there's a pool
at the hotel.

53:49.965 --> 53:52.925
That's cool, but, um...

53:54.448 --> 53:55.754
You know...

54:00.237 --> 54:01.934
What?

54:01.977 --> 54:04.502
You guys don't have to keep
trying so hard

54:04.589 --> 54:06.852
to spend one-on-one time
with me.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.941
I mean, what's the deal?

54:08.984 --> 54:11.944
Did you read that in
a parenting manual or something?

54:14.729 --> 54:16.209
[male commentator] But they've
a second chance in the game

54:16.296 --> 54:18.211
and number 13 hooks the ball

54:18.298 --> 54:19.908
straight down the wing,
it's a dangerous move

54:19.995 --> 54:21.519
across the goal, it feels like

54:21.606 --> 54:23.825
just a matter of time
before they score.

54:23.912 --> 54:25.697
And the cross is in,
and he heads it in...

54:25.784 --> 54:28.700
[cheering on TV]

54:33.400 --> 54:34.967
Mom, what are you doin'?

54:35.054 --> 54:36.534
I told you I'm ready
to make dinner tonight.

54:36.621 --> 54:38.362
Don't mind me.

54:42.627 --> 54:44.977
[doorbell rings]

54:48.546 --> 54:49.634
[remote beeps]

55:05.693 --> 55:07.869
- Mariah.
- Jim.

55:07.956 --> 55:09.784
It's so good to see you.

55:09.871 --> 55:12.613
Oh. You look fantastic!

55:12.700 --> 55:14.702
There she is!

55:14.789 --> 55:16.704
- [chuckles] Hi, Claire.
- [Claire] Look at you.

55:16.791 --> 55:18.227
Like a supermodel.

55:18.271 --> 55:20.055
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

55:20.142 --> 55:23.450
Thank you so much
for coming on such short notice.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.322
It's been way too long.

55:27.062 --> 55:28.412
You did know I was coming,
right?

55:28.499 --> 55:29.804
Yeah, yeah, of course,
I-I just...

55:29.891 --> 55:32.329
I-I, I lost track of time.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.287
We're just, um...

55:36.245 --> 55:38.335
I'mma go change real quick.
[chuckles]

55:38.422 --> 55:39.379
- For you.
- Oh.

55:39.466 --> 55:40.424
You brought

55:40.511 --> 55:41.816
a lovely bottle of wine.

55:41.903 --> 55:43.862
You are so thoughtful.

55:43.949 --> 55:45.603
Let's crack this baby open.

55:45.690 --> 55:47.518
- Shall we?
- Sure.

55:47.605 --> 55:50.172
I know
I certainly could use a glass.

55:50.259 --> 55:52.044
Or three.

55:54.307 --> 55:56.353
[indistinct chatter]

55:57.528 --> 55:59.704
So how's school?

55:59.791 --> 56:01.358
It's fine.

56:02.794 --> 56:04.230
What's wrong?

56:06.275 --> 56:07.538
Nothing.

56:09.017 --> 56:10.541
Come on, Sydney.

56:11.455 --> 56:13.065
You can tell me.

56:13.587 --> 56:15.154
No.

56:15.241 --> 56:17.504
You don't want to hear it.

56:17.591 --> 56:19.898
What do you mean?

56:19.985 --> 56:23.554
I mean,
I'm worried about moving.

56:23.597 --> 56:26.078
I'm worried
about losing all of my friends

56:26.121 --> 56:27.775
and I'm worried
about starting high school

56:27.862 --> 56:29.473
without knowing anybody.

56:30.952 --> 56:34.739
But we have to...
because of your job.

56:37.263 --> 56:41.093
Well, you know,
that makes a lot of sense.

56:42.529 --> 56:44.183
I'd be worried
about those things, too,

56:44.270 --> 56:46.272
if I were in your shoes.

56:48.492 --> 56:50.842
But you know your dad and I
are gonna be there for you.

56:52.974 --> 56:57.501
I know that's not saying much,
but... we wouldn't be doing this

56:57.588 --> 56:59.938
if we didn't think that,
in the long run,

57:00.025 --> 57:03.681
this was gonna be a really good
experience for you.

57:03.768 --> 57:05.509
Well, what about grandma?

57:06.379 --> 57:07.380
What about her?

57:07.467 --> 57:09.208
We're just gonna leave her here?

57:09.295 --> 57:11.297
Alone?

57:11.384 --> 57:13.212
That doesn't seem right.

57:15.257 --> 57:17.477
I still think your grandfather's
gonna come back.

57:17.564 --> 57:19.044
And if he doesn't?

57:20.393 --> 57:22.700
If he doesn't, then,

57:22.787 --> 57:25.137
we'll make sure
she's taken care of.

57:26.007 --> 57:28.401
"Taken care of?"

57:28.488 --> 57:30.316
What does that even mean?

57:35.060 --> 57:36.801
To be honest...

57:38.672 --> 57:40.718
I don't really know right now,
Sydney.

57:43.198 --> 57:46.027
It was an incredible meal,
Claire. Thank you so much.

57:46.114 --> 57:47.942
It was my pleasure.

57:48.029 --> 57:49.944
It's so good to see you,

57:50.031 --> 57:52.686
to see the two of you
together again.

57:52.773 --> 57:55.733
Just like old times.

57:55.820 --> 57:58.170
You were
the most perfect couple.

58:00.520 --> 58:04.655
I always thought you might
end up together. [chuckles]

58:04.742 --> 58:07.745
- Little more?
- Oh. I shouldn't.

58:08.876 --> 58:10.617
Oh!

58:10.704 --> 58:14.665
I just remembered I owe
my friend, Susie, a phone call.

58:14.752 --> 58:17.798
I'm gonna go do that right now.

58:17.885 --> 58:21.454
Don't you dare go any place,
okay? You two have to catch up.

58:21.541 --> 58:22.673
Okay.

58:26.938 --> 58:29.288
You really didn't know
that I was coming over tonight.

58:29.375 --> 58:31.333
Did you?

58:31.420 --> 58:33.510
- You know what this feels like?
- What?

58:33.597 --> 58:35.555
That scene in sitcoms
where the kids are trying

58:35.599 --> 58:38.906
to trick their parents
into getting back together.

58:38.993 --> 58:42.257
I mean, she doesn't let
just anybody eat off this china.

58:42.344 --> 58:44.651
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Stop it.

58:44.738 --> 58:46.827
I can't think
she's gonna hear us.

58:46.914 --> 58:49.613
Hey. Easy now.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.658
[sighs] Remember to breathe.

58:51.745 --> 58:53.573
[chuckles]

58:53.660 --> 58:56.620
Oh. [chuckles] Man.

58:58.709 --> 59:00.885
I haven't laughed like that
since...

59:05.411 --> 59:06.543
Hey.

59:09.807 --> 59:12.157
It's really good to see you.

59:12.244 --> 59:14.115
It's good to see you.

59:14.202 --> 59:18.163
And, well, if you want to talk
about anything, I'm here.

59:19.338 --> 59:21.253
Thanks, Jim.

59:21.296 --> 59:22.994
[footsteps approaching]

59:23.081 --> 59:24.430
[dramatic music]

59:24.517 --> 59:26.084
[Jim clears throat]

59:26.171 --> 59:27.607
Hi, Allison.

59:27.694 --> 59:30.305
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, no, this isn't a...

59:30.392 --> 59:32.656
This isn't awkward.

59:32.743 --> 59:35.093
Allison, uh...

59:39.663 --> 59:41.099
What's going on?

59:41.186 --> 59:43.101
Nothing. We just had dinner.

59:45.233 --> 59:47.148
Yeah. I can see that.

59:47.235 --> 59:49.673
Really, Allison,
it's not what it looks like.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.980
Oh, yeah?
What's it look like to you?

59:53.067 --> 59:57.115
Like... a romantic dinner.

59:58.246 --> 01:00:00.597
Yeah. Basically.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.903
But Jim didn't orchestrate this.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.993
Oh. No, I can tell
that Jim didn't make this meal.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.343
Thank you very much.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.519
This is Claire's handiwork.

01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:12.521
Yeah, she called me
and invited me over,

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.001
but Jim didn't know.

01:00:14.088 --> 01:00:16.395
- Can Jim not speak for himself?
- [Jim] Come on.

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:18.310
Mariah's just trying to explain.

01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:22.923
That your mom tricked you both
into a romantic dinner

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.577
and you were helpless
to do anything,

01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:28.102
except for eat the meal
and hold hands?

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.931
Is, is that about right?

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.585
- You don't understand.
- Uh, you know what?

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:33.847
- I should...
- [Allison] Am I right?

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:37.198
- I should leave.
- Yes, you should.

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:38.983
Allison, you're being rude.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.681
Your daughter just saw you being
intimate with another woman.

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.031
You realize that?

01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:46.512
I realize Sydney saw me
holding a friend's hand,

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:49.602
a-and I'm gonna explain to her
exactly why.

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.648
I can't wait to hear that.

01:00:53.345 --> 01:00:55.782
I'm sorry, Allison.

01:00:55.869 --> 01:00:57.784
Oh, Mariah,
you don't have to go.

01:00:57.871 --> 01:01:01.396
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Jim.

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:04.486
Let me at least show you
to your car.

01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:07.533
- What a gentleman.
- Would you shut up, Allison?

01:01:12.277 --> 01:01:13.452
[door opens]

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.541
[door shuts]

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:22.026
Where is everybody?

01:01:24.637 --> 01:01:27.118
Sorry I ruined
your little scheme

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:30.382
before Jim and Mariah
could fall in bed together.

01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.514
My little scheme?

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:34.691
Oh, that's right.

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:36.997
You don't scheme
against anybody.

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:40.392
You never have ulterior motives,
do you?

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:41.785
[scoffs] I'm confused.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:45.049
What is it you're implying,
Allison?

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:47.442
I'm not implying anything.

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:50.489
I'm accusing you
of setting up this dinner

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:53.144
in order to cause a rift
between Jim and I.

01:01:53.231 --> 01:01:54.798
My Lord!

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:57.670
I would never, ever,

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.628
ever do such a thing.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.804
[door opens]

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:04.372
You did do such a thing, Claire.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:08.246
And congratulations. It worked.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:17.429
How was Mariah? I-I didn't
get a chance to say goodbye.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:21.433
She's okay.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.046
It just,
it just breaks my heart.

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:29.093
I mean, look at her.
She seems so healthy.

01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:32.096
What do you mean?

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:34.620
Jim?

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.843
I know she doesn't look it,
but Mariah's been pretty sick

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:41.845
for a while.

01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.934
I don't know how much time
she has left.

01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:50.854
It's just so sad.

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:53.944
Isn't it?

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:06.826
Why didn't you tell me?

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.872
I don't know. I should have.

01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:12.876
I've had a hard time
processing it myself.

01:03:15.008 --> 01:03:16.923
She ran in to my mom
a few days ago and texted me,

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:20.666
and... I've just been trying
to listen to how she feels.

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:24.670
She's scared.
I mean... of course, she is.

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:29.022
- [sighs]
- I know what it must look like.

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.719
Like, my mom was trying
to rekindle some old flame,

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.418
but I think she was just trying
to make Mariah feel good

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.898
for an evening.

01:03:40.555 --> 01:03:42.993
I'm gonna talk to Sydney. I need
to explain what was going on.

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:48.520
- Allison?
- Yeah. No, go ahead.

01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:05.754
Oh. Hi, Will.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.496
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

01:04:08.583 --> 01:04:11.369
Things have been
a little tense around here.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:17.114
To be frank, it's Allison.
Yeah.

01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:20.204
If I didn't know better,
I-I would be worried.

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:25.600
Well, I just never realized

01:04:25.644 --> 01:04:28.647
what a bad temper she has.

01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:31.041
[scoffs] Uh,
it's a little scary.

01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:37.090
Oh. I'm sure it's nothing.

01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:39.223
Just me being a worrywart.

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:43.357
How about you, sweetie?

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:45.055
How was your day?

01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:50.625
[Allison sighs]

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:53.672
[mellow music]

01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:15.999
[intense music]

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:48.466
[music continues]

01:05:56.778 --> 01:05:59.738
[no audio]

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:16.842
[music continues]

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:31.030
at the concert. Send me lots of pictures.

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.684
- Okay.
- I love you.

01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:35.730
- Bye, grandma. See you tomorrow.
- Miss you, baby.

01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:38.211
- We'll call you later.
- Take care of your daddy.

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:39.343
Bye.

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:43.521
You drive safe, you hear me?

01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:46.263
No fighting, you two.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.699
[scoffs] Us? Fight?

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.396
[laughing]

01:06:49.483 --> 01:06:51.181
Bye.

01:06:51.268 --> 01:06:52.704
Have fun.

01:06:57.535 --> 01:06:58.710
[Allison sighs]

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:03.367
I'm gonna make us a nice dinner
tonight, Claire.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.151
We need to talk.

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:08.111
I thought I would cook tonight.

01:07:08.198 --> 01:07:10.591
No. I'm gonna cook.

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:13.420
But first
I'm gonna go for a run.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:15.379
Since when do you run?

01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.034
Since right now.

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:23.387
[dramatic music]

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.575
[doorbell rings]

01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:43.320
Great. Now what?

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:44.582
[scoffs]

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:51.719
You destroyed
my best friendship, Claire.

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.765
What else do you want from me?

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:55.071
[grunts]

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:02.339
[Claire grunting]

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:23.273
[crickets chirping]

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:32.194
Oh.

01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:34.283
We're eating in the dining room.

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:39.810
And using the china.

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.117
If it's good enough
for Jim and Mariah,

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:43.510
it's good enough
for you and me, right?

01:08:43.596 --> 01:08:45.077
Have a seat.

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:49.995
Stir-fry.

01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:53.041
Looks very nice.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.479
Though I never cared for it.

01:08:58.612 --> 01:09:00.265
No, thank you.

01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:02.660
It's not a weeknight.
Live a little.

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:08.187
What shall we toast to?

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.015
To new beginnings.

01:09:11.321 --> 01:09:13.018
If you say so.

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:19.024
Ugh, it's not that
Two-Buck-Chuck stuff, is it?

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:20.504
Let's eat.

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:23.115
I called Mariah.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.551
I needed to apologize

01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:26.379
for the way I treated her.

01:09:26.423 --> 01:09:28.076
Oh, good for you.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:32.080
I know it's not easy for you
to admit to your mistakes.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.212
That was a good move
on your part.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.475
The way you made me look bad
like that.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:39.566
But it wasn't very fair
to Mariah, was it?

01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:43.265
Oh, Allison, I never tried
to make you look bad.

01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:46.660
Um, yeah, you have,

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:49.402
many, many times.

01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:52.710
Why do I feel like
I'm being ambushed here?

01:09:52.796 --> 01:09:54.407
No ambush.

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.061
I just think
it's time for the two of us

01:09:56.148 --> 01:09:58.063
to be honest with each other.

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:01.980
I'm always honest with you.

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:05.636
Are you sure there's nothing
you wanna get off your chest?

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:08.160
- Nope.
- No problem you have with me?

01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:12.077
Now is your chance.
Anything you wanna say at all.

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:16.908
Is this dinner
or a family therapy?

01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:19.693
I made the mistake
at the beginning

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.436
for not putting my foot down,
for not setting boundaries,

01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:26.700
starting with letting you
take over the wedding.

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:29.921
That was my fault,
and I shouldn't have done that.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:33.751
Most brides would've killed
for that wedding.

01:10:34.447 --> 01:10:35.840
That's true.

01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:39.060
But your son was marrying me.

01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:41.149
And it's not what I wanted.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.413
Is there a point to this, dear?

01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:46.764
You're a wonderful mother.

01:10:48.722 --> 01:10:51.464
You've raised a fantastic son.

01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:54.946
He is respectful and caring.

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:58.950
And you're
a fantastic grandmother.

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:01.344
Sydney adores you.

01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.261
But either you treat me
with respect...

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.612
or get out of my house.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:16.794
Understood.

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:21.886
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:23.279
Good.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.546
Tell me, Allison...

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:33.158
did you use some meat tenderizer
on this steak?

01:11:33.898 --> 01:11:35.552
You know?

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:39.164
Whack! Whack! Whack!

01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:43.255
Um, actually, I did.

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.301
Mm. I knew it.

01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:48.652
Mm! Hm-hm!

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:09.194
Yeah. I think we really
hashed some things out.

01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:14.199
Yeah. Well,
I think it went pretty well.

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:16.984
Yeah?

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.552
Well, I'm glad
Sydney enjoyed the concert.

01:12:19.639 --> 01:12:21.337
I miss you guys.

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.515
I love you. See you tomorrow.

01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:27.517
Goodnight.

[Will on voicemail]
Hello, it's Will.

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:11.648
Leave a message, please.

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:13.432

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.391
[whispering] I'm so afraid.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:16.870
It's Allison.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.568
I need your help.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:53.951
You're sleepwalking again.

01:13:55.692 --> 01:13:58.172
- What?
- [grunts]

01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:00.958
[whimpering]

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.224
What are you doing?

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.400
What am I doing?

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:10.750
What anybody would do if
their daughter-in-law went crazy

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:13.971
in the middle of the night
and tried to kill them.

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:15.668
I'm defending myself.

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:17.583
Oh, my God.

tacky little, naughty...

01:15:03.194 --> 01:15:06.066
J-Jim is my son!

Oh! Oh, Will! Oh, Will!

01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:51.198
Oh, thank God, you got
my message. She went crazy.

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.026
She said
she was gonna get rid of me

01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:56.203
the same way she got rid
of her friend, Charlie.

01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.728
Charlie?
What are you talking about?

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.730
You tried to stab me.

01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:03.036
She tried to stab me.

01:16:03.123 --> 01:16:04.908
She tried to kill me.

01:16:04.995 --> 01:16:07.127
You are insane!

01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.433
You don't know
what you're talking about!

[Will] You stop right there!

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:12.655
Don't let me pull out my gun,
Allison.

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:14.395
I don't want to, but I will.

01:16:14.482 --> 01:16:17.398
Will, you don't understand.
That's not what happened.

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:18.835
Yeah, yeah, fine.

01:16:18.922 --> 01:16:20.445
You stay right there

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:45.862
Is that, is that
what [whispers] she used

01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:48.125
to kill Charlie?

01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:51.215
I believe
it's the murder weapon, yes.

01:16:51.302 --> 01:16:53.304
Wiped clean of fingerprints.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.617
We found it in your closet,
Allison.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:04.315
Huh?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.450
Oh, come on, Will.

01:17:09.494 --> 01:17:11.278
Well, think about it.

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:14.891
If I did do it, well, why would
I hold on to that thing?

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:19.417
You don't really believe

01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:22.812
that I killed my best friend?

01:17:24.074 --> 01:17:27.947
I love Charlie. Loved her.

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:30.254

this is happening.

But, Will, you know me.
You know me.

Why would I do
something like that?

01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:43.397
Uh, the pool guy said
that you and Charlie

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.835
had a really big argument
the other day.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.447
Yeah. So what?

01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:52.058
So what was it about?

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:53.930
It was about Claire.

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:58.412
Oh... God!

01:17:58.499 --> 01:18:02.286
Yeah, yeah, somehow
Claire put all this together.

01:18:02.373 --> 01:18:03.896
Yeah.

01:18:03.983 --> 01:18:07.204
Sh-she definitely has something
to do with this.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:09.423
Oh. It's always Claire's fault,
isn't it?

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.208
The woman
who raised your husband,

01:18:11.295 --> 01:18:13.036
your daughter's grandmother.

01:18:15.473 --> 01:18:17.736
A poor woman
who's dealing with the fact

01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:19.869
that her husband ran off
with another woman

01:18:19.956 --> 01:18:22.480
after nearly four decades
of marriage.

01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:26.571
When can I see Jim?

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:30.270
Who you really need to see

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:31.924
is a lawyer.

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:35.493
Please, Will,
I just wanna see Jim.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.712
Please.

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:39.323
Will, you're wrong.

must have just got to her.

Her job, the move...

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:57.733
Lord knows
I'm not the easiest houseguest.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:01.084
I'm sure
I just made things worse.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.088
Jim?

01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:09.832
Allison's not a killer, mom.

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:11.659
I know she's not.

Twenty-four hours ago
I would've said

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:15.315
the exact same thing.

01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:18.362
But, Jim,
sh-she tried to kill me.

01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:21.191
Do you understand that?

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:26.196
You do believe me, don't you?

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:30.853
Jim, I'm your mother.

01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:34.291
Jim.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.731
You can see her now.

01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:55.442

- I took her over to Kelly.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:56.748
She doesn't know
what's going on here.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.663
Okay, good. Good. That's good.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:01.840
Allison, what is going on?

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:04.669
You know I didn't do it, right?
Any of it.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.717
Jim...

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.111
Listen to me very carefully.

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:15.114
It is time for you
to make a decision.

01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:17.725
You either choose me
or you choose your mother.

01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:20.424
I choose you.
Of course, I do, Allison.

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:22.513
Okay. Good answer.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.343
Well, now I need you to-to go
to your parents' house right now

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.172
and-and-and before she has
a chance to get rid of anything.

01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:31.261
What, what would
she be getting rid of?

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.306
Listen to me very carefully.

01:20:33.393 --> 01:20:36.005
Look around.
Check the entire house.

01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:38.921
What am I looking for?

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:40.966
Jim, I hope that I'm wrong,

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:44.622
but I don't think that your dad
ran off with another woman.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:45.928
What?

01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:47.755
I mean, do you really think

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.889
that your dad would do that
to your mom?

01:20:50.933 --> 01:20:52.804
I don't think so.

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:55.241
You know, and even if he did,

01:20:55.328 --> 01:20:58.636
I mean, do you really think
that, that he w-would

01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:01.813
ignore youthis whole time?

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.730
No. He loves you
more than anything.

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:08.907
You're the most important thing
in the world to him.

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:11.997
He would at least want a chance
to explain himself to you.

01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:15.740
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:17.785
- All right. I'll go there now.
- Okay.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:20.179
Okay, good. Go.

01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:24.880
I love you.

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:33.584

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:03.744
Great. She forgot to pay
her power bill.

Flashlight. Flashlight...

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:19.195
I hope you're wrong about this,
Allison.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.549
Mm!
