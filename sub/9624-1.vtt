WEBVTT

02:27.843 --> 02:30.095
Come here, yes,
come here, oh, yes...

02:31.556 --> 02:32.847
You bitch!

02:32.848 --> 02:37.848
I'll kill you, I'll kill you,
I'll kill you!

03:38.914 --> 03:43.293
Don't even try to move my clear,
you're completely paralyzed.

03:43.294 --> 03:46.921
You might remember my friend,
the Brazilian Wandering spider.

03:46.922 --> 03:51.922
He's very aggressive,
highly poisonous.

03:56.349 --> 04:01.349
Not even your handsome boyfriend,
Arturo, can save you now.

04:11.155 --> 04:14.407
Damn!
Another jump cut.

04:14.408 --> 04:19.408
I wouldn't make such mistakes
if it weren't for...

04:19.747 --> 04:24.747
I think the piece
you want is at the bottom.

04:30.383 --> 04:32.592
Here it is!

04:32.593 --> 04:33.301
Thank you, Bella.

04:33.302 --> 04:35.970
Say, why don't you try cutting
it in this time, uh?

04:35.971 --> 04:40.809
No. I can't. I'm not ready.
I'm still a student.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.478
Don't be silly.
You're my assistant.

04:43.479 --> 04:48.479
Please, give it a try,
why don't you?

05:03.749 --> 05:08.749
If you were my student,
I'd say that's A+ work.

05:10.423 --> 05:14.300
You see that there
on the screen, Bella?

05:14.301 --> 05:18.012
That's as close to living
as you and I will ever come.

05:18.013 --> 05:21.015
Aren't we living now?

05:21.016 --> 05:26.016
If this is living I want
no part of it.

05:43.748 --> 05:46.791
Bluuuuuuuuuhhhhh!

05:46.792 --> 05:48.668
Oh, sorry, editor.

05:48.669 --> 05:50.754
I didn't know it was you.
I thought you were Veronica...

05:50.755 --> 05:52.672
BQO!

05:52.673 --> 05:56.134
Well done, Claudio, scaring the
old editor half to death.

05:56.135 --> 05:57.594
If he ends up in the morgue,

05:57.595 --> 05:59.387
how will our film
ever get finished?

05:59.388 --> 06:00.472
0h, really?

06:00.473 --> 06:02.474
And if you scared me to death,
the lead actor?

06:02.475 --> 06:04.476
How then would the
film be finished?

06:04.477 --> 06:09.477
Oh, Claudio.

06:22.495 --> 06:27.495
I wasn't really scared.

06:53.734 --> 06:55.610
Honey, I'm in our home.

06:55.611 --> 07:00.611
Can't hear you,
I'm shaving my legs.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.242
I'm sorry, it's a little...

07:02.243 --> 07:07.243
Late.
That's what time it is.

07:07.915 --> 07:12.669
You lost track of time again,
editing that crap.

07:12.670 --> 07:13.962
It is my work.

07:13.963 --> 07:17.549
I must do it,
no matter how long it takes.

07:17.550 --> 07:20.885
It's filth.

07:20.886 --> 07:23.805
Francesco hasn't
made a decent film

07:23.806 --> 07:27.475
since I stepped out
of the spotlight.

07:27.476 --> 07:28.810
Well,
you're still in my spotlight.

07:28.811 --> 07:33.439
And what of Claudio?
Did you see him today?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.817
Claudio, Claudio, Claudio.

07:35.818 --> 07:38.152
Every day you ask me
of this young man.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.946
He's nothing but a foolish boy.

07:39.947 --> 07:44.075
He's magnificent.

07:44.076 --> 07:46.286
He's an artist.

07:46.287 --> 07:50.915
You could never understand
the passion we have.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.084
You're not an actor.

07:53.085 --> 07:55.837
And what if Claudio were
to suddenly die, huh?

07:55.838 --> 07:58.882
What then?

07:58.883 --> 08:02.010
How dare you say that?

08:02.011 --> 08:07.011
I would cry. I would cry, cry,
cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry!

08:09.685 --> 08:14.606
I would never ever stop crying!

08:14.607 --> 08:19.607
You stupid cripple.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.284
<i>Lights.</i>

08:26.285 --> 08:29.913
<i>Camera.</i>

08:29.914 --> 08:31.497
Action.

08:31.498 --> 08:36.498
<i>No, not her. Why'd it have
to be her? No! No!</i>

08:43.760 --> 08:46.179
She's dead.

08:46.180 --> 08:50.433
Don't worry. We'll catch the
killer that killed her.

08:50.434 --> 08:51.809
Arturo, she was a dancer.

08:51.810 --> 08:54.270
She was the best,
the best, the best!

08:54.271 --> 08:55.647
Snap out of it, man!

08:55.648 --> 08:58.691
She was a hell of a dancer,
damn straight.

08:58.692 --> 09:00.818
Babe, babe, babe.
Come on. Watch!

09:00.819 --> 09:05.819
<i>But an even
better drug addict.</i>

09:20.798 --> 09:24.592
A hairy little man.
Let me guess...

09:24.593 --> 09:29.263
You're out here thinking
of killing yourself too, huh?

09:29.264 --> 09:34.264
Well, let's just say we
saved each other then.

09:44.071 --> 09:47.615
Terrific, no?

09:47.616 --> 09:49.951
Yes, very good, Claudio.

09:49.952 --> 09:54.330
Now, perhaps you use
some of those moves on me...

09:54.331 --> 09:59.331
Veronica, I'm watching me,
not you.

10:02.047 --> 10:07.047
Veronica, there is more.
There's more!

10:10.931 --> 10:15.931
<i>A mannequin, ha! I knew it!
A tape player! Of course!</i>

10:18.856 --> 10:22.984
Arturo, you've been hit!

10:22.985 --> 10:25.486
All in a day's work, partner.

10:25.487 --> 10:28.114
<i>Now let's get one of those
cold beers.</i>

10:28.115 --> 10:31.159
No, my scene.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.412
The editor's going to kill me.
That was his work print.

10:34.413 --> 10:37.165
Don't worry about that
silly little man.

10:37.166 --> 10:42.166
He can cut it as many times
as you like. He's pathetic.

10:47.384 --> 10:50.595
I guess you're right.
I'm sorry, Veronica.

10:50.596 --> 10:53.139
I just don't want to cause any
trouble for the studio,

10:53.140 --> 10:58.140
you understand?

11:01.690 --> 11:03.649
What was that?
Who's there?

11:03.650 --> 11:07.111
It's nobody.
Stop resisting me.

11:07.112 --> 11:09.530
I've heard these old studios
have ghosts,

11:09.531 --> 11:12.450
and I'll be damned if
I let myself see one.

11:12.451 --> 11:17.451
Ghosts?
Oh, Claudio.

11:46.026 --> 11:51.026
No, please, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

12:02.876 --> 12:05.461
Hey.

12:05.462 --> 12:08.631
Coffee, Mr. Ciso?

12:08.632 --> 12:13.427
No thanks, Bella.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.472
It's really weird. I went home
last night, did I not?

12:16.473 --> 12:18.683
Yes, Mr. Ciso. You left
just before I did.

12:32.156 --> 12:34.740
I need to speak to
the man in charge.

12:34.741 --> 12:39.078
That would be me,
Francesco Mancini.

12:39.079 --> 12:42.331
Do you know who the last person
was to see these two alive?

12:42.332 --> 12:44.417
No, I don't know. I didn't know
they were still in the building

12:44.418 --> 12:46.961
last night.
I knew Rey was there editing.

12:46.962 --> 12:48.462
Alright, who's Rev?

12:48.463 --> 12:51.215
That's the cripple,
the editor...

12:51.216 --> 12:54.177
Rey, introduce yourself,
damn it.

12:54.178 --> 12:55.720
I'm Rey Ciso.

12:55.721 --> 12:57.513
You saw these two last night?

12:57.514 --> 13:00.558
I don't remember.

13:00.559 --> 13:04.729
I remember seeing Claudio.
He was dressed as the devil.

13:04.730 --> 13:05.646
The devil?

13:05.647 --> 13:07.023
Yes, Satan himself.

13:07.024 --> 13:10.526
- Right here, sir.
- Oh, yes, the dark lord.

13:10.527 --> 13:15.323
How does this go again?
Oogagaga. Sort of a thing.

13:15.324 --> 13:17.867
Did you see anything suspicious?

13:17.868 --> 13:21.204
Uh, not that I recall. They
kissed as lovers should,

13:21.205 --> 13:23.831
and I left them
in an embrace.

13:23.832 --> 13:25.708
And who found the body?

13:25.709 --> 13:29.295
That was my actress,
Margarit.

13:29.296 --> 13:33.424
Ah, yes, Margarit.
I believe I know her.

13:33.425 --> 13:35.676
And the film in the projector...

13:35.677 --> 13:38.012
Giancarlo! Why has this body
not been cut down?

13:38.013 --> 13:39.305
Couldn't find a ladder, sir.

13:39.306 --> 13:42.725
Good boy.

13:42.726 --> 13:45.645
The print in the projector.
That's a film being shot here?

13:45.646 --> 13:49.440
Yes, it was one of the
editor's work prints.

13:49.441 --> 13:52.318
Interesting how that name
keeps coming up.

13:52.319 --> 13:55.279
Editor, how did they get their
hands on that, I wonder?

13:55.280 --> 14:00.280
- I have no idea.
- You sure of that?

14:00.327 --> 14:02.370
Christos!

14:02.371 --> 14:07.166
What? Can't you light
a simple match?

14:07.167 --> 14:08.960
It's these damn wooden fingers.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.254
I see that.

14:11.255 --> 14:15.716
Yes, well. Until my boys are
done bagging evidence

14:15.717 --> 14:17.468
and I've had a chance
to sort through it,

14:17.469 --> 14:20.471
I'll be keeping my eye on all
of you. Everyone's a suspect,

14:20.472 --> 14:22.807
so I don't advise any of you
to trust one another

14:22.808 --> 14:26.727
until I've found
the guilty party.

14:26.728 --> 14:31.728
And I will.

14:32.901 --> 14:37.113
Hysterical blindness.
Not the first case I've seen,

14:37.114 --> 14:39.156
but it's not too common either.

14:39.157 --> 14:42.535
A woman's eyes weren't meant to
see such things, you understand?

14:42.536 --> 14:43.619
Is it permanent?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.621
Will she look
that way forever?

14:45.622 --> 14:47.581
- What way? How do I look?
- Hard to say.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.500
She'll need plenty of rest,
though.

14:49.501 --> 14:54.501
It was so horrible.
I can't get it out of my head.

14:54.881 --> 14:57.300
<i>I gotta give it
to you straight, Ciso.</i>

14:57.301 --> 14:58.509
Your work ain't great,

14:58.510 --> 15:00.511
but I'm gonna need your help
to pull this thing off

15:00.512 --> 15:02.847
now without a leading man.

15:02.848 --> 15:07.143
Leading man? I'm happy to
step up to the plate, Francesco.

15:07.144 --> 15:10.021
Rey, you must know Cal Konitz?

15:10.022 --> 15:12.356
Claudio's sidekick
in the picture.

15:12.357 --> 15:17.357
Hi... Wow, you should have
warned me about that.

15:17.362 --> 15:19.363
Hopefully you'll be seeing a
lot more of me in the picture.

15:19.364 --> 15:21.365
- Am I right, Francesco?
- This is Cesare.

15:21.366 --> 15:23.701
He's going to be taking on
Claudio's part.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.911
We're damn lucky to get
such a good lookalike.

15:25.912 --> 15:28.414
The only damn problem is
he doesn't speak a word

15:28.415 --> 15:31.417
- of English. Do you Cesare?
- Niente, niente.

15:31.418 --> 15:34.003
Ah hell, that's what
dubbing is for!

15:34.004 --> 15:34.920
Oh, Francesco.

15:34.921 --> 15:37.840
Uh, I was actually
talking to Cesare and he kind of

15:37.841 --> 15:39.842
- wants to play the sidekick.
- Francesco, I don't think...

15:39.843 --> 15:42.178
I know you don't think, Rey.
That's my job.

15:42.179 --> 15:45.598
Your job is to earn the 75
bucks a week I pay you.

15:45.599 --> 15:48.225
Oh, Francesco. I, uh, actually
shot this footage this morning

15:48.226 --> 15:50.102
and I think you could use it
for my demo reel

15:50.103 --> 15:51.395
for me to play Claudio.

15:51.396 --> 15:53.856
You see this Rey? You'll have
to learn this new medium.

15:53.857 --> 15:55.858
It's what we'll be shooting
our next movie on.

15:55.859 --> 15:58.152
How do I get the film out
of this little black box?

15:58.153 --> 15:59.195
Good one, Rey.

15:59.196 --> 16:02.198
I knew it would be
fun having a cripple around.

16:02.199 --> 16:04.617
What about that editor?
Didn't you tell me

16:04.618 --> 16:07.244
all the victims were missing
the same fingers he was?

16:07.245 --> 16:10.706
You're right. That might be
a good place to start.

16:10.707 --> 16:15.044
Come on, Porfiry. This is your
chance to prove yourself.

16:15.045 --> 16:16.587
Prove myself, sir?

16:16.588 --> 16:19.590
Look. You've been on the force,
what, a year?

16:19.591 --> 16:22.301
Now you and I both know that
my daughter had a lot to do

16:22.302 --> 16:24.303
- with you getting promoted.
- No, I...

16:24.304 --> 16:26.597
Damn if I don't give that girl
anything she wants.

16:26.598 --> 16:29.975
My daughter better come
out of this unscathed.

16:29.976 --> 16:31.977
- Do you understand me, Porfiry?
- Uh-huh.

16:31.978 --> 16:34.105
I got Giancarlo keeping
an eye on her

16:34.106 --> 16:37.149
24/7 in the meantime.

16:37.150 --> 16:38.484
Okay.

16:38.485 --> 16:40.569
And you should really use
your service revolver.

16:40.570 --> 16:41.904
That foreign knock-off of yours

16:41.905 --> 16:44.031
is going to
get someone killed.

16:44.032 --> 16:47.910
I've tried the revolvers.
I prefer the 1911.

16:47.911 --> 16:50.162
Well, all I know is my partner
twenty years ago

16:50.163 --> 16:52.373
used one of those foreign
weapons and he almost

16:52.374 --> 16:54.542
blew his hand off.

16:54.543 --> 16:57.420
You don't need to worry, sir.
I won't let you down.

16:57.421 --> 17:00.297
No, you won't,
because if you do you are

17:00.298 --> 17:03.092
going to be back in uniform
handing out parking tickets

17:03.093 --> 17:06.512
for the rest of your life.

17:06.512 --> 17:11.512
Unscathed.
You got that, Porfiry?

18:15.582 --> 18:16.457
She matches the description.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.417
I demand to know who
you men are!

18:18.418 --> 18:21.295
She's your killer.
We're going to prove it.

18:21.296 --> 18:24.131
Five thousand dollars
says this is a mask.

18:29.721 --> 18:34.225
Shit.

18:34.226 --> 18:35.684
I'm gonna push it right there.

18:35.685 --> 18:39.772
Yep. It'll stick. Come on.
Get back on there.

18:39.773 --> 18:41.232
And... she's good.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.734
I don't even have five
thousand dollars.

18:43.735 --> 18:46.570
I demand to know
who you men are!

18:46.571 --> 18:48.989
Are Y°" Okay, Sophie?

18:48.990 --> 18:53.990
Hey. I'm Arturo,
officer of the law.

19:02.712 --> 19:05.673
As I said, he was once
in an asylum.

19:05.674 --> 19:09.552
I don't know the details but
I heard it from several sources.

19:09.553 --> 19:11.804
I wish I knew more, but I don't.

19:11.805 --> 19:13.430
The sooner this is over,
the better.

19:13.431 --> 19:17.059
Agreed, and by the way,
Francesco,

19:17.060 --> 19:20.104
The Cat with the Velvet Blade is
probably my favorite film.

19:20.105 --> 19:25.105
Grazie.

19:30.031 --> 19:32.783
Is this what you
wanted me to wear?

19:32.784 --> 19:35.953
Yes, yes, yes!

19:35.954 --> 19:40.954
<i>Yes!</i>

19:43.670 --> 19:46.839
What have you to confess,
my son?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.174
I've had impure thoughts,
father.

19:49.175 --> 19:51.343
I've wished for terrible
things to happen

19:51.344 --> 19:53.429
and those things have happened.

19:53.430 --> 19:56.307
Rey, is that you?

19:56.308 --> 19:58.517
I'm losing control, father.

19:58.518 --> 20:00.853
I can't tell what's
real anymore.

20:00.854 --> 20:03.939
Can I ask you something, my son?

20:03.940 --> 20:05.816
Of course, father.

20:05.817 --> 20:08.819
What's it like on those
big fancy film sets?

20:08.820 --> 20:12.281
I've always wanted to know.

20:12.282 --> 20:17.282
I'm an editor so I don't spend
too much time on set.

20:18.913 --> 20:22.374
- Too bad.
- Sorry, father.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.753
You're married to
Josephine Jardin, aren't you?

20:25.754 --> 20:29.798
The star of
The Mirror and the Guillotine?

20:29.799 --> 20:31.925
Is she dead?

20:52.155 --> 20:57.155
- Au revoir, Cesare.
- Bye, Cesare.

20:59.996 --> 21:04.996
<i>Cesare, Cesare, Cesare...</i>

21:06.336 --> 21:10.297
Whoa. Sorry there, Cesare.
Great job today.

21:10.298 --> 21:13.092
You almost sounded like
a real American human being.

21:13.093 --> 21:17.763
Grazie, grazie.

21:17.764 --> 21:19.807
That's an excellent
penis you have.

21:19.808 --> 21:24.808
This is turning out to be a
great night after all.

21:26.439 --> 21:31.439
See you later, Cesare, buddy!

21:36.282 --> 21:41.282
<i>Cesare...</i>

21:49.713 --> 21:54.713
<i>Cesare...</i>

22:25.457 --> 22:27.458
<i>5,000 dollars
says this is a mask.</i>

22:42.098 --> 22:44.099
Did you hear the
great news, Ciso?

22:44.100 --> 22:46.268
I'm going to be a star!

22:46.269 --> 22:47.561
Yeah, somebody killed
that foreign guy

22:47.562 --> 22:49.772
and Francesco's going to
make me the lead.

22:49.773 --> 22:54.773
Come see!

22:58.740 --> 23:03.740
Editor, look!
Told you.

23:07.165 --> 23:09.500
There you are, Ciso.

23:09.501 --> 23:11.126
I'm not going to find
a better doppelganger

23:11.127 --> 23:13.629
- than that foreigner so...
- Not now!

23:13.630 --> 23:15.464
So Cal's our new hero.

23:15.465 --> 23:18.217
Recut the film to make
Claudio look like his sidekick.

23:18.218 --> 23:20.886
Yes, I could use some of
the footage Konitz gave me.

23:20.887 --> 23:23.889
I finally got it out of the box,
it's uh, all black.

23:23.890 --> 23:26.600
MY tape!

23:26.601 --> 23:28.101
I guess I can
make another copy.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.186
I noticed you're wearing
the same clothes as

23:29.187 --> 23:30.521
you were yesterday, editor.

23:30.522 --> 23:32.564
Is that because you weren't
at home last night?

23:32.565 --> 23:34.525
I always wear
the same clothes.

23:34.526 --> 23:35.275
And what about you?

23:35.276 --> 23:37.528
You're wearing the
same clothes also.

23:37.529 --> 23:38.904
I'm an inspector, Rey.

23:38.905 --> 23:41.156
I have to wear the same
clothes every day.

23:41.157 --> 23:42.616
If you're going to arrest
Rey can you do it

23:42.617 --> 23:44.201
after he finishes the picture?

23:44.202 --> 23:46.662
Francesco tells me that you
used to be in the madhouse.

23:46.663 --> 23:48.121
Care to explain?

23:48.122 --> 23:52.626
I had a nervous breakdown, yes.
It does not make me the killer.

23:52.627 --> 23:54.378
Do you want tell me what
happened now or shall

23:54.379 --> 23:55.796
we wait until we're down
at the station

23:55.797 --> 23:59.633
and I'm booking you for murder?

23:59.634 --> 24:03.178
I was a great editor,
at one time.

24:03.179 --> 24:07.099
Perhaps the greatest editor
the world had ever seen.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.602
I worked hard at it,
just like anyone.

24:10.603 --> 24:14.273
That is until the clay that
I met Umberto Fantori.

24:14.274 --> 24:17.776
I don't do many things, sir.

24:17.777 --> 24:21.822
I don't know how to
fill a tax form.

24:21.823 --> 24:26.823
I cannot walk a dog,
but I see into the heart.

24:27.412 --> 24:30.664
So I can see into your heart.

24:30.665 --> 24:35.665
And that what makes
editor for film.

24:36.296 --> 24:41.296
So for Mirror et Guillotine,
only you, my friend.

24:41.885 --> 24:46.885
I need a woman!

24:46.890 --> 24:50.434
I need a woman!

24:50.435 --> 24:53.812
I am a woman,
under these clothes.

24:53.813 --> 24:55.898
<i>Umberto Fantori has
another stellar success</i>

24:55.899 --> 24:58.191
<i>on his hands with
The Mirror and the Guillotine.</i>

24:58.192 --> 25:00.235
<i>Claudio Calvetti
shines in his role</i>

25:00.236 --> 25:02.446
<i>as the tortured hero
in need of a woman,</i>

25:02.447 --> 25:04.072
<i>but the real stars
of the picture</i>

25:04.073 --> 25:06.366
<i>are Josephine Jardin
and Rey Ciso.</i>

25:06.367 --> 25:09.161
<i>You won't miss Josephine
as the grief-stricken nun,</i>

25:09.162 --> 25:10.996
<i>torn between her
God and her lust</i>

25:10.997 --> 25:12.789
<i>for the miscreant, Calvetti...</i>

25:12.790 --> 25:16.084
<i>I had the perfect life.
Even my wife loved me.</i>

25:16.085 --> 25:21.085
The next film is really what
I was brought for to do.

25:22.425 --> 25:27.425
La Vita, you understand?
No end, no middle, no beginning.

25:27.597 --> 25:30.182
Where is end?
Who knows.

25:30.183 --> 25:32.517
<i>I let my ego get
the better of me and</i>

25:32.518 --> 25:34.603
<i>I accepted the ultimate
challenge.</i>

25:34.604 --> 25:36.480
<i>Edit the world's longest film.</i>

25:36.481 --> 25:38.607
<i>The interminable work
drove me to the point</i>

25:38.608 --> 25:40.484
<i>of frenzy but years passed.</i>

25:40.485 --> 25:41.610
Would you
get off please?

25:41.611 --> 25:45.197
There's only a page and a half

25:45.198 --> 25:49.660
and the real meat of
it is in the middle,

25:49.661 --> 25:51.370
so can we please just continue?

25:51.371 --> 25:53.747
No, you're finished.
Really, you're done here.

25:53.748 --> 25:55.791
Okay?
Get her off the set.

25:55.792 --> 25:59.127
<i>And as my wife lost
her place in the spotlight...</i>

25:59.128 --> 26:04.128
<i>The life we were living
was truly put to rest.</i>

26:15.103 --> 26:20.103
No!

26:24.112 --> 26:26.488
So I spent some time
in the hospital.

26:26.489 --> 26:29.324
But not the madhouse
as you call it.

26:29.325 --> 26:33.662
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.455
- Oh my God!
- Jesus Christ, Margarit.

26:35.456 --> 26:36.748
- Cover those up.
- What?

26:36.749 --> 26:39.167
He's right, Margarit.
Your breasts are showing.

26:39.168 --> 26:44.168
Not those, these.

27:16.831 --> 27:19.499
Mr. Ciso, you scared me.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.210
What did the inspector say?
Are we in danger?

27:22.211 --> 27:23.962
No, Bella.
Don't worry.

27:23.963 --> 27:27.674
It's the actors who make
so many enemies.

27:27.675 --> 27:31.428
Just be glad you and I
work behind the scenes.

27:31.429 --> 27:33.430
We go unnoticed.

27:33.431 --> 27:36.266
It's true, Mr. Ciso.

27:36.267 --> 27:38.018
When I was a little girl
I used to sit in my

27:38.019 --> 27:39.978
father's projection booth.

27:39.979 --> 27:43.940
I would watch the films and
help him change the reels.

27:43.941 --> 27:48.028
"People come to the theatre
for magic," he would say.

27:48.029 --> 27:50.030
If the audience knew
how many magicians

27:50.031 --> 27:55.031
were working behind the scenes,
the spell would be broken.

27:56.788 --> 28:00.957
Your father was a
very strange man, Bella.

28:00.958 --> 28:04.961
Best you hear it from me,
someone who cares.

28:04.962 --> 28:08.381
Yes, well, enough about me.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.592
What are we working on today,
the body double footage?

28:10.593 --> 28:11.843
No, Bella!

28:11.844 --> 28:14.971
Uh, I was hoping you would
show me the reel

28:14.972 --> 28:16.056
you've been working on.

28:16.057 --> 28:18.183
Oh, Mr. Ciso, I don't know.

28:18.184 --> 28:21.520
I don't think it's worthy
of your eyes yet.

28:21.521 --> 28:24.940
Nonsense, Bella.

28:31.239 --> 28:33.115
Mr. Konitz,
may I have a word?

28:33.116 --> 28:35.200
Thank you very much,
my little friend, goodbye.

28:35.201 --> 28:36.785
You may have as many
words as you like.

28:36.786 --> 28:38.328
This is the best clay of
my life and I'm

28:38.329 --> 28:39.663
always happy to meet
a new friend.

28:39.664 --> 28:41.331
My most prized possession.

28:41.332 --> 28:43.166
Sweetheart, are you
finished packing yet, or...?

28:43.167 --> 28:46.294
Jasmine!
Inspector, I am sorry.

28:46.295 --> 28:47.212
Peter?

28:47.213 --> 28:49.005
My woman's not usually
such a bitch.

28:49.006 --> 28:50.298
Jasmine?

28:50.299 --> 28:52.092
You two know each other?

28:52.093 --> 28:53.677
Jasmine and I were lovers.

28:53.678 --> 28:55.428
It's true.

28:55.429 --> 29:00.429
Peter was a strong
and passionate man.

29:53.321 --> 29:55.155
Too funny!

29:55.156 --> 29:57.991
Holy shit.

29:57.992 --> 30:01.036
Tell me, inspector, do you think
you'll be hungry around six?

30:01.037 --> 30:04.247
I'd like to talk about your
adventures as a man of the law

30:04.248 --> 30:06.249
and undercover with Jasmine.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.585
You're an eager young man
and I'll be god damned

30:08.586 --> 30:10.462
if I don't tell you
that I respect that.

30:10.463 --> 30:12.005
I would love to have dinner
with you and your lady,

30:12.006 --> 30:14.674
but I'm afraid I'll have to
take a rain check this time.

30:14.675 --> 30:17.302
I've got a lot more
investigating to do.

30:17.303 --> 30:21.056
Ah yes.
Cloak and dagger stuff, eh?

30:21.057 --> 30:26.057
Say no more, but I warn you,
I'll be taking that rain check.

30:28.272 --> 30:31.524
- Good to meet you.
- Very good to meet you.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.485
Yes, bye for now, then.

30:38.824 --> 30:40.617
Oh, clear.

30:40.618 --> 30:43.161
Mr. Konitz.
You dropped something.

30:43.162 --> 30:46.498
I swear I'd lose my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

30:46.499 --> 30:48.375
Especially with a
killer on the loose.

30:48.376 --> 30:50.919
You don't want to leave things
like this lying around.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.297
In the wrong hands,
they become weapons.

30:54.298 --> 30:55.924
You're a man who's seen
darkness and returned

30:55.925 --> 30:58.385
to tell the tale,
aren't you?

30:58.386 --> 31:00.929
Indeed I am.

31:00.930 --> 31:05.930
Ciao.

31:07.311 --> 31:09.354
Beautiful body of work
you have here, Bella.

31:09.355 --> 31:11.022
You really think so, Mr. Ciso?

31:11.023 --> 31:14.693
The rhythm, the splicing.
It's all very good.

31:14.694 --> 31:17.529
But you forgot
one reaction shot.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.531
Common mistake.

31:19.532 --> 31:21.408
Stupid! Stupid!
You're so stupid!

31:21.409 --> 31:24.661
Bella! Stop!
Give me that.

31:26.706 --> 31:28.456
What are you doing?

31:28.457 --> 31:33.128
Mr. Ciso, you're a great artist.

31:33.129 --> 31:35.005
The way you edit with
your wooden fingers.

31:35.006 --> 31:38.758
I see you suffering
for your work.

31:38.759 --> 31:43.638
You're like van Gogh
with his wooden ear.

31:43.639 --> 31:48.639
And I... and I just wanna...

31:50.938 --> 31:55.938
I'm sorry...
I'm so ashamed.

32:02.783 --> 32:07.783
Bella.
You mustn't cry, huh?

32:27.433 --> 32:29.934
No, Bella.

32:29.935 --> 32:32.062
I'm a happily married man.

32:32.063 --> 32:36.483
Mr. Ciso,
you don't understand.

32:36.484 --> 32:39.402
I'm in love with you.

32:39.403 --> 32:42.197
Nonsense.

32:42.198 --> 32:46.451
You don't know what love is.

32:46.452 --> 32:49.204
You're just a little girl.

32:49.205 --> 32:51.998
Now fly away, butterfly.

32:51.999 --> 32:56.252
Play with the boys
your own age, huh?

32:56.253 --> 33:01.253
But I do know what love is.

33:01.717 --> 33:04.928
You are like the sun.

33:04.929 --> 33:09.929
And everyone here is walking
around under an umbrella.

33:10.434 --> 33:14.104
But I see you.

33:14.105 --> 33:17.857
I feel you.

33:17.858 --> 33:20.485
Your warmth.

33:20.486 --> 33:23.238
Your light.

33:23.239 --> 33:26.074
Please, Mr. Ciso.

33:26.075 --> 33:30.328
Make me a woman!

33:30.329 --> 33:35.329
I said no, god damn it!

33:50.516 --> 33:52.517
What have you done now?
I heard screaming.

33:52.518 --> 33:56.604
It's nothing. Just my assistant.

33:56.605 --> 33:58.398
She's a mad little girl,
you understand?

33:58.399 --> 33:59.190
And what's this?

33:59.191 --> 34:01.151
You always take company
property home with you?

34:01.152 --> 34:04.028
Let me have a look at it.

34:04.029 --> 34:08.032
You can have a look when you
show me a warrant, Inspector.

34:08.033 --> 34:13.033
I can have that warrant
in a number of hours, editor!

34:13.164 --> 34:16.916
Claudio, Veronica, Cesare.

34:16.917 --> 34:21.917
I'll find the killer
who killed you.

34:33.309 --> 34:35.851
The food
here is delicious.

34:35.853 --> 34:38.730
Why aren't you eating?

34:38.731 --> 34:42.692
Uh... I had a big lunch.

34:42.693 --> 34:46.237
So you're just going to sit
there and watch me eat?

34:46.237 --> 34:48.364
Why are you so weird?

34:48.364 --> 34:49.199
Did I tell you?

34:49.199 --> 34:51.201
The police were back
at the studio today.

34:51.202 --> 34:55.413
Christ!

34:55.414 --> 34:59.167
I thought we could focus
on us for a change.

34:59.168 --> 35:03.671
Maybe bring back that old spark.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.548
But no.

35:05.549 --> 35:10.512
Here we go with
the film talk again.

35:10.513 --> 35:14.182
Don't you know how much
it hurts to be reminded

35:14.183 --> 35:17.101
that my career is over?

35:17.102 --> 35:19.187
I don't mean in a movie.

35:19.188 --> 35:21.439
There was another
murder at the studio.

35:21.440 --> 35:25.235
Am I supposed
to be surprised, Rey?

35:25.236 --> 35:28.154
With all the sluts and violence.

35:28.155 --> 35:32.408
Did you really think a fancy
dinner would make up

35:32.409 --> 35:37.409
for the fact that you didn't
come home last night?

35:37.498 --> 35:39.999
And look at what you're wearing.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.628
Your old dirty work clothes.

35:43.629 --> 35:46.714
You know what?
I feel ill.

35:46.715 --> 35:48.716
I think I caught that
bug of yours.

35:48.717 --> 35:51.135
And I'm going to be
sick right now.

35:51.136 --> 35:53.388
On this carpet right here.

35:53.389 --> 35:55.932
You're going to have
to clean it up.

35:55.933 --> 35:59.143
You.

35:59.144 --> 36:00.895
What's the matter with you?

36:00.896 --> 36:04.357
I've been tailing you secretly,
but I can't take it anymore.

36:04.358 --> 36:06.359
You need to keep
your woman in line.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.903
I did it for you this time
because I feel sorry for you.

36:08.904 --> 36:11.656
Next time you might
not be so lucky.

36:11.657 --> 36:14.951
I might slap you in the face.

36:14.952 --> 36:17.620
A man slapping a man,
imagine that.

36:17.621 --> 36:21.249
Have a wonderful evening.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.085
He's right.

36:24.086 --> 36:28.965
What am I supposed to do,
slap myself?

36:28.966 --> 36:33.966
I told you it was that horrible
restaurant that made me ill.

37:57.388 --> 38:01.849
What are you doing?

38:01.850 --> 38:06.850
Turn off that damn light.

38:07.606 --> 38:12.606
Ugh.
You're impossible.

39:08.500 --> 39:13.500
A to Ciso...

39:15.132 --> 39:19.427
Yeah.

39:19.428 --> 39:22.305
Got you.

39:22.306 --> 39:25.224
What the h...

39:25.225 --> 39:29.353
Damn.
Damn, come on.

39:29.354 --> 39:30.938
Oh, damn.

39:30.939 --> 39:33.858
Come on...
Come on.

39:34.902 --> 39:37.820
Who's there?

39:37.821 --> 39:41.324
Answer me.

39:41.325 --> 39:43.993
- Hello.
- Kiss me.

39:43.994 --> 39:48.994
- Sorry, What's that?
- Kiss me. Kiss me!

39:57.549 --> 39:59.008
There you are.

39:59.009 --> 40:04.009
Got away from me, did you?

40:09.478 --> 40:14.478
So she got you with that old
“kiss me, I bite you" trick.

40:21.323 --> 40:26.323
Cigarette?

40:28.372 --> 40:31.040
So you say you are an inspector?

40:31.041 --> 40:32.416
That's right.

40:32.417 --> 40:36.796
I can tell you a thing or
two about Rey.

40:36.797 --> 40:41.259
He was an up and coming
editor before I met him.

40:41.260 --> 40:46.260
Before he almost killed
his assistant, Giuseppe.

40:46.265 --> 40:51.265
Mr. Ciso, I think I found
the film you wanted.

40:56.525 --> 40:59.485
Mr. Ciso...

40:59.486 --> 41:04.486
Mr. Ciso.

41:11.373 --> 41:15.710
Have you heard of
Plato's cave, Inspector?

41:15.711 --> 41:19.255
I think I've seen it, yeah.

41:19.256 --> 41:21.674
It's not a film.

41:21.675 --> 41:24.176
Though it should be.

41:24.177 --> 41:28.556
Plato described a cave
where men are raised

41:28.557 --> 41:31.267
watching shadows on the wall.

41:31.268 --> 41:36.268
Believing them to be people,
animals, trees and what not.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.525
And what has this to
do with Mr. Ciso?

41:39.526 --> 41:42.361
Rey believed that
nothing was real,

41:42.362 --> 41:47.362
that we're all just
marionettes on a stage.

41:47.910 --> 41:51.245
We convinced him otherwise
but he didn't stay

41:51.246 --> 41:53.247
in our institution too long.

41:53.248 --> 41:58.127
He was signed for
and released...

41:58.128 --> 42:00.379
by Fantori.

42:00.380 --> 42:02.214
Fantori?

42:02.215 --> 42:05.968
Umberto Fantori.

42:05.969 --> 42:10.681
An intimidating man.

42:10.682 --> 42:14.477
I was so...

42:14.478 --> 42:19.478
...excited when I got
his autograph.

42:20.108 --> 42:24.445
On the release form.

42:24.446 --> 42:27.281
I really admire his films.

42:27.282 --> 42:31.369
Especially the one where
the man climbs the tree

42:31.370 --> 42:36.370
and screams
“I need a woman, a woman!"

42:36.667 --> 42:40.252
Perhaps I should pay
this Fantori a visit.

42:40.253 --> 42:42.463
Inspector...

42:42.464 --> 42:45.257
He's dead for years.

42:45.258 --> 42:48.970
What of his assistant, Giuseppe?

42:48.971 --> 42:53.766
Let me show you something.

42:53.767 --> 42:56.727
My god...
What's happened to him?

42:56.728 --> 42:58.354
Why's he wrapped in
these bandages?

42:58.355 --> 43:00.064
I don't know.

43:00.065 --> 43:04.944
Weird.
Really weird.

43:04.945 --> 43:07.530
Thank you for all the
information, Dr. Casini.

43:07.531 --> 43:08.823
I really appreciate it.

43:08.824 --> 43:11.033
Inspector.

43:11.034 --> 43:12.827
Inspector.

43:12.828 --> 43:15.997
Don't tell Rey what
we talked about.

43:15.998 --> 43:18.582
- Sure.
- Inspector.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.543
I'm serious.

43:20.544 --> 43:25.544
I'm not even friends with him.

43:29.845 --> 43:32.096
Kiss me.

43:32.097 --> 43:37.097
Bite me.

44:01.960 --> 44:05.880
Damn.

44:07.799 --> 44:08.591
<i>Rome, No'.!</i>

44:08.592 --> 44:10.926
Jesus Christ, Margarit.
What is that?

44:10.927 --> 44:13.262
Oh this is Rolfie,
a seeing-eye dog.

44:13.263 --> 44:15.598
Daddy brought him
by earlier for me.

44:15.599 --> 44:16.640
Isn't he sweet?

44:16.641 --> 44:20.394
Yes, I only wish that
you'd told me.

44:20.395 --> 44:24.565
I wanted to introduce you to him
at dinner but... did you forget?

44:24.566 --> 44:28.652
It's this case.
It's driving me so mad.

44:28.653 --> 44:31.113
Is it the case...

44:31.114 --> 44:32.907
Or is it my eyes?

44:32.908 --> 44:36.494
It's the case, I promise.

44:36.495 --> 44:39.163
And the doctor said the
eye problem might,

44:39.164 --> 44:41.582
probably be temporary,
did he not?

44:41.583 --> 44:44.418
Peter, I can't lose
both my career

44:44.419 --> 44:46.962
and my husband in the
same week, I can't...

44:46.963 --> 44:51.963
Margarit, I still love you.

46:14.176 --> 46:19.176
Oh, Peter.

46:37.324 --> 46:38.824
But where were you on
the night of the murder

46:38.825 --> 46:41.535
if you know so much about it?

46:41.536 --> 46:43.662
I was at home washing my hair

46:43.663 --> 46:48.663
and shaving my pussy.

46:51.922 --> 46:56.922
Your story checks out.

47:03.558 --> 47:06.185
What's happening?

47:06.186 --> 47:09.563
Who could that be at this hour?

47:09.564 --> 47:12.358
Peter?
What's happening?

47:12.359 --> 47:17.359
Hello?

47:17.906 --> 47:22.117
What is it, Rolfie?
What is it?

47:22.118 --> 47:24.328
Hello?

47:26.289 --> 47:29.124
Margarit?

47:29.125 --> 47:30.918
Margarit,
what's the matter?

47:30.919 --> 47:33.545
Margarit, open the door.
Open the door, Margarit!

47:33.546 --> 47:35.047
Why is the door locked?

47:37.050 --> 47:42.050
Who's there?

47:46.643 --> 47:51.643
Damn it!
Hold on, Margarit!

47:52.148 --> 47:57.148
Keep away from the door!

48:08.123 --> 48:10.082
Is the killer in there with you?

48:10.083 --> 48:14.461
- Help. Help me.
- Damn it, is it Rey Ciso?

48:14.462 --> 48:19.462
Non-

49:28.953 --> 49:32.247
<i>Come here, Rome. That's it.
That's a good boy.</i>

49:32.248 --> 49:35.584
Hold it right there!
Drop the axe now.

49:35.585 --> 49:37.336
How dare you point
that gun at me?

49:37.337 --> 49:42.216
I'm the inspector on this case,
not you, not you!

49:42.217 --> 49:43.342
The killer was here.

49:43.343 --> 49:45.803
He's probably miles away by now,
thanks to you.

49:45.804 --> 49:48.138
Wait!
You forgot this.

49:48.139 --> 49:50.516
Shit. Now your prints are
on the murder weapon.

49:50.517 --> 49:52.434
I'm sorry.
You've got a pair on you, boy,

49:52.435 --> 49:55.020
standing up to
an inspector like that.

49:55.021 --> 49:59.024
But that's my wife on the floor!
You understand?

49:59.025 --> 50:00.859
Did you get a look
at her killer?

50:00.860 --> 50:04.613
Yes.
It was a black figure.

50:04.614 --> 50:06.198
You know, I have an
opening for an

50:06.199 --> 50:09.118
undercover man and
you might just fit the bill.

50:09.119 --> 50:11.203
Would you be
interested in that, Giancarlo?

50:11.204 --> 50:14.748
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

50:14.749 --> 50:17.209
Why don't you say you saw
the man who killed Margarit?

50:17.210 --> 50:19.920
Why don't you
say it in court?

50:19.921 --> 50:23.757
- The black man, sir?
- Your words, not mine.

50:23.758 --> 50:25.717
Though I guess
it was a black man,

50:25.718 --> 50:27.553
now that you remember
seeing him.

50:27.554 --> 50:30.097
But I remember...
But I wasn't here, sir.

50:30.098 --> 50:33.892
Oh, Giancarlo, that drink's
gone straight to your brain.

50:33.893 --> 50:36.145
You've already forgotten
that you were here.

50:36.146 --> 50:38.355
That your prints are
on the murder weapon.

50:38.356 --> 50:40.357
You probably shouldn't be
drinking while you're on duty.

50:40.358 --> 50:43.152
I haven't touched a drop myself.
I just like to hold it.

50:43.153 --> 50:46.238
A good man holds a beer.

50:46.239 --> 50:50.075
I'm only trying to help you,
Giancarlo.

50:50.076 --> 50:51.910
All right.

50:51.911 --> 50:55.164
So you'll say it...
“I saw him."

50:55.165 --> 50:57.499
- I saw him.
- The black man.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.168
The black man.

50:59.169 --> 51:02.421
That's sounding very good.
Very convincing.

51:02.422 --> 51:05.591
You'll make a good
cop one day, Giancarlo.

51:05.592 --> 51:07.342
But I am a cop, sir.

51:07.343 --> 51:09.678
You heard me,
you're out of here.

51:09.679 --> 51:11.889
Honestly, Rey.
I thought it might be fun

51:11.890 --> 51:14.391
to have a cripple around,
but I was dead wrong.

51:14.392 --> 51:16.602
Not to mention you've
practically cut Cal

51:16.603 --> 51:18.520
- out of the whole movie.
- What?

51:18.521 --> 51:21.857
And this guy shows up
today telling me

51:21.858 --> 51:23.525
all kinds of facts
about film that

51:23.526 --> 51:26.570
I'd never even heard before.

51:26.571 --> 51:28.989
And better yet,
he's agreed to work

51:28.990 --> 51:30.532
for half of what I'm paying you.

51:30.533 --> 51:33.076
So what can I say, Rey?

51:33.077 --> 51:37.039
Have you ever even
seen a film by Einstein?

51:37.040 --> 51:38.290
Eisenstein?

51:39.542 --> 51:42.503
It's pronounced Einstein,
Einstein.

51:42.504 --> 51:47.504
So get your stuff and
get the fuck out of here!

51:57.310 --> 51:58.727
Hi.

51:58.728 --> 52:00.062
- Mr. Ciso.
- Not now, Bella.

52:00.063 --> 52:02.064
- But, Mr. Ciso.
- I said not now!

52:02.065 --> 52:04.775
- Where are you going?
- Francesco's fired me.

52:04.776 --> 52:06.401
He's hired some amateur
with a head full

52:06.402 --> 52:09.446
of facts but no mind for art.

52:09.447 --> 52:12.991
- What? No. That can't be.
- Don't come any closer, Bella.

52:12.992 --> 52:15.369
Has anyone else been in here.
Anyone other than you?

52:15.370 --> 52:16.912
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

52:16.913 --> 52:19.623
Ciso, you son of a bitch,
you've got a lot to answer for.

52:19.624 --> 52:21.416
I talked to Dr. Casini
at the asylum,

52:21.417 --> 52:23.335
your story didn't exactly
match up with his.

52:23.336 --> 52:25.712
I told you everything
I remember, Porfiry.

52:25.713 --> 52:27.923
We're all editors of
our own realities.

52:27.924 --> 52:30.467
How Dr. Casini remembers
my time in the asylum

52:30.468 --> 52:34.555
might not be exactly
how it happened.

52:34.556 --> 52:39.101
I wasn't done talking
to you, editor!

52:39.102 --> 52:40.936
What's this?

52:40.937 --> 52:45.691
It's a wrench.

52:45.692 --> 52:47.568
No, what's this?

52:47.569 --> 52:50.070
Oh, it's a $500 tape machine

52:50.071 --> 52:54.366
I had to buy to watch that
film you left for me.

52:54.367 --> 52:57.160
That was not for you to watch.

52:57.161 --> 52:59.496
I was going to tell you
it's the first

52:59.497 --> 53:04.497
good thing you've edited in
an extremely long time.

53:04.919 --> 53:06.461
I had nothing
to do with this crap.

53:06.462 --> 53:07.754
I've never seen it
before in my life.

53:07.755 --> 53:12.755
Technical talk.
Call it what you want.

53:13.970 --> 53:18.970
I love it.
And who is this man?

53:20.018 --> 53:22.311
Cal Konitz.

53:22.312 --> 53:27.312
He's magnificent.
Maybe even better than Claudio.

53:30.320 --> 53:35.320
Such... beautiful hands.

53:36.826 --> 53:40.704
I was fired.

53:40.705 --> 53:44.875
You were...
You were what?

53:44.876 --> 53:49.876
I was fired.

53:56.679 --> 54:01.558
Who's going to pay for the food?

54:01.559 --> 54:06.559
Who's going to pay
for my clothes?

54:07.732 --> 54:12.732
Who's going to pay for this
damn $500 Beta machine?!

55:37.321 --> 55:39.364
<i>I'll find you.</i>

55:39.365 --> 55:44.365
I'll see who's been
tormenting Mr. Ciso.

55:55.298 --> 56:00.298
Bella!

56:19.739 --> 56:21.865
You? No.

56:21.866 --> 56:26.866
NOOOOO!

57:07.620 --> 57:10.956
Are you crazy?
You light some rags in the sink

57:10.957 --> 57:14.042
and expect that to
fix the plumbing?

57:14.043 --> 57:19.043
Bella... Bella!

57:50.663 --> 57:52.998
Hey! What are you doing here?

57:52.999 --> 57:57.294
- Where were you, huh?
- I was out. I was studying.

57:57.295 --> 58:02.295
I was getting more
books on my studying.

58:03.009 --> 58:04.843
- Holy shit!
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

58:04.844 --> 58:05.969
REY, Rey, Rey, calm down.

58:05.970 --> 58:07.512
What the fuck's the
matter with you?

58:07.513 --> 58:09.055
- What's going on?
- He's a murderer!

58:09.056 --> 58:10.807
I'm not a murderer.
You're a murderer.

58:10.808 --> 58:12.017
- I'm a cop.
- You're a cop?

58:12.018 --> 58:15.520
- What? No. No.
- Bella's dead.

58:15.521 --> 58:18.440
Is she?
My god, another one?

58:18.441 --> 58:21.234
Cal, call inspector Porfiry
at once then help

58:21.235 --> 58:24.195
the new editor to
clean up the lab.

58:24.196 --> 58:25.864
I know you must be
frightened by all of this

58:25.865 --> 58:28.408
but it seems to happen around
here fairly often, lately.

58:28.409 --> 58:31.036
You've got to get back
to work at once.

58:31.037 --> 58:33.538
I need this picture completed,
you understand?

58:33.539 --> 58:36.625
Okay. Good boy.

58:36.626 --> 58:38.585
Who said anything about
an editing lab, Francesco?

58:38.586 --> 58:40.128
- What?
- I said she was dead.

58:40.129 --> 58:41.212
I didn't say where it happened.

58:41.213 --> 58:43.298
Well she worked in the
editing lab.

58:43.299 --> 58:46.301
What the fuck? I don't have
to explain myself to you!

58:46.302 --> 58:48.845
I don't want to see you
around here anymore.

58:48.846 --> 58:49.930
You understand me?

58:49.931 --> 58:54.931
You take death with
you wherever you go.

58:57.939 --> 59:02.939
Making movies used to be fun.

59:04.070 --> 59:09.070
- Lift her legs!
- I'm trying. She's too pretty.

59:30.805 --> 59:35.805
Not bad, Giancarlo.
Not bad.

59:38.604 --> 59:43.604
Perhaps this book can tell me
where the next cut should be.

59:44.819 --> 59:46.778
Spiders, spiders, spiders.
Ah here we are.

59:46.779 --> 59:51.779
Tarantulas and film editing.

01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:05.356
You're a great editor, truly.
Sure, you have wooden fingers,

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:06.608
but who doesn't at times.

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:08.485
- And you're a smart man.
- Yeah.

01:01:08.486 --> 01:01:13.486
Perhaps even a genius
and that wife of yours...

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:15.950
- she could be an actress.
- She was.

01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:17.535
She was?
What was she in?

01:01:17.536 --> 01:01:19.621
I've seen every movie
in the world.

01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:22.082
Please don't talk about her,
she's a fuckin'...

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:24.918
a fuckin' train wreck.
Sorry, Rey.

01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:27.253
Listen. I'm in a hell
of a mess here, Ciso.

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:30.173
If you can give me
Tarantola I can-

01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:33.051
- You cut it?
- Before you fired me.

01:01:33.052 --> 01:01:38.052
Ciso! You saved me, Ciso.
You saved me.

01:01:38.933 --> 01:01:41.684
Cal, take these reels
up to the screening room.

01:01:41.685 --> 01:01:45.188
It's time for a premiere
screening of your new movie.

01:01:45.189 --> 01:01:50.189
You are...
God damn it!

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.282
Bye.

01:01:56.283 --> 01:02:01.283
Where do you find these people?

01:02:07.503 --> 01:02:12.382
He's not your man,
you know.

01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:16.010
Ciso.
He's not your man.

01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:18.513
I know editors have
their negative side,

01:02:18.514 --> 01:02:20.306
so I understand your suspicion-

01:02:20.307 --> 01:02:25.307
Don't talk to me.
I can arrest you for that.

01:02:25.646 --> 01:02:27.689
Don't tell me you
believe in that

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:29.023
old superstition, do you?

01:02:29.024 --> 01:02:30.900
What superstition?

01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:33.570
Well, in Roman times
editors were considered

01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:37.073
to be a bridge between
the netherworld.

01:02:37.074 --> 01:02:39.826
They were used in summonings
and bringing-forths and so on.

01:02:39.827 --> 01:02:41.786
Hence the Latin root
of the word, Editor.

01:02:41.787 --> 01:02:44.122
Bridges to the netherworld?

01:02:44.123 --> 01:02:47.417
Oh, they were considered
bridges to the netherworld.

01:02:47.418 --> 01:02:52.418
I don't want to hear
your wizard speak.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.425
A young Donald Sutherland.

01:03:50.022 --> 01:03:52.273
You think you can cut
me out of the movie? Huh?

01:03:52.274 --> 01:03:56.236
You think you can cut me
out of the movie, editor?

01:03:56.237 --> 01:03:59.155
I'll cut you out!

01:03:59.156 --> 01:04:04.035
I'm going to cut off
your click with this!

01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:08.373
I'll cut you up! You fucked with
the wrong guy, editor.

01:04:08.374 --> 01:04:11.292
I'm going to cut
you into bits, editor.

01:04:11.293 --> 01:04:15.255
I'll cut you up.

01:04:15.256 --> 01:04:17.215
I don't believe you.

01:04:17.216 --> 01:04:20.885
I'll kill you, editor.
I'll cut you up.

01:04:20.886 --> 01:04:24.097
You want to know why I
cut you out of the film?

01:04:24.098 --> 01:04:26.224
Why?

01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:28.184
Because you're a terrible actor.

01:04:28.185 --> 01:04:31.729
You've got a lot of balls for a
guy who's about to be fish food.

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:34.107
No, what I have is
a trained eye.

01:04:34.108 --> 01:04:36.234
You see, Konitz,
whenever you act,

01:04:36.235 --> 01:04:39.320
or whatever the hell
you're doing, you blink.

01:04:39.321 --> 01:04:41.990
You blink like you have
smoke in your eyes.

01:04:41.991 --> 01:04:43.825
You couldn't kill a man.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:48.826
You couldn't even
act like a killer.

01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:56.417
You're messing
with the wrong guy, editor.

01:04:57.214 --> 01:04:58.881
I'll get you, editor.

01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:03.882
Put me back in the movie,
or else.

01:05:17.985 --> 01:05:19.485
<i>If you're
wondering if you</i>

01:05:19.486 --> 01:05:21.529
got the right man for the job,

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:26.530
I can tell you a
hundred percent, you do.

01:05:28.579 --> 01:05:31.622
I just don't know if
I'm gonna take it.

01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:36.623
What can I do to convince you?

01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:42.004
Yeah, yeah, hey...
Oh... yeah...

01:06:26.929 --> 01:06:31.766
Yep. Twice a week I like to go
swimming down by the pier.

01:06:31.767 --> 01:06:34.018
Jasmine scolds me
for going alone.

01:06:34.019 --> 01:06:36.270
She thinks it's dangerous.

01:06:36.271 --> 01:06:39.399
I'm not surprised.
You're a brave man.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.443
Maybe you'd like to
join me sometime.

01:06:42.444 --> 01:06:44.404
She wouldn't have to
worry about me and you

01:06:44.405 --> 01:06:47.615
- could swim with a good friend.
- I'd like that.

01:06:47.616 --> 01:06:48.991
NOW!

01:06:48.992 --> 01:06:50.952
About why I brought you here.

01:06:50.953 --> 01:06:53.162
Yes, you said that you had
some evidence on the editor.

01:06:53.163 --> 01:06:55.581
It's not evidence, exactly.

01:06:55.582 --> 01:07:00.582
But I threatened him,
for cutting me out of the movie.

01:07:00.671 --> 01:07:02.964
He cut you out of the picture?

01:07:02.965 --> 01:07:04.549
Can you believe it?

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:06.717
He's clearly a mad man.

01:07:06.718 --> 01:07:08.428
Yes.
A mad man.

01:07:08.429 --> 01:07:11.514
I held a chainsaw right up
to his face and he insulted me.

01:07:11.515 --> 01:07:15.977
That's not the behavior
of a sane man.

01:07:15.978 --> 01:07:19.021
- Speak of the devil.
- What? Is he here?

01:07:19.022 --> 01:07:21.899
What? No.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.027
We were just talking about
the devil man, Rey.

01:07:25.028 --> 01:07:27.238
That's not what that
expression means.

01:07:27.239 --> 01:07:28.865
Hmm.

01:07:28.866 --> 01:07:30.658
You might be onto
something, though.

01:07:30.659 --> 01:07:32.869
I have a suspicion and
it's certainly a wild one.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.120
I like the sound of
this already.

01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:36.038
I think that Rey might have

01:07:36.039 --> 01:07:38.749
- some ties to the occult.
- ...have some ties to occult.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.793
That's right!
I was thinking the same.

01:07:40.794 --> 01:07:43.421
But how am I expected to
reason with a man like this?

01:07:43.422 --> 01:07:45.465
You know what you
might try is the wife.

01:07:45.466 --> 01:07:48.426
I think the way to get to
Rey is through his wife.

01:07:48.427 --> 01:07:49.969
I think she might
be able to convince

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.221
him to extend your scenes.

01:07:52.222 --> 01:07:54.140
I like the way
you think, Porfiry.

01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:58.144
Speaking of wives,
my condolences, Porfiry.

01:07:58.145 --> 01:08:00.855
Thank you.

01:08:00.856 --> 01:08:03.816
Jasmine... Jesus Christ.

01:08:03.817 --> 01:08:06.319
You're going to pay for
dinner because of that.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.030
I said if you did this you were
going to pay for dinner.

01:08:09.031 --> 01:08:11.532
<i>That is,
unless you can tell me</i>

01:08:11.533 --> 01:08:13.868
<i>where the money is.</i>

01:08:13.869 --> 01:08:15.244
<i>Oh, God damn it!
You're a mad man.</i>

01:08:15.245 --> 01:08:17.662
<i>A bastard.
Ahhh!</i>

01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:19.582
<i>If only I could untie
myself from</i>

01:08:19.582 --> 01:08:21.375
<i>the rope with this
mangled hand.</i>

01:08:21.376 --> 01:08:23.586
<i>I'm no man at all.</i>

01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:25.671
<i>Damn it!
You know what?</i>

01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:30.671
<i>I might take my cut of
the fortune out of your...</i>

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:45.358
Josephine?

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.651
<i>You know what?</i>

01:08:46.652 --> 01:08:49.487
<i>I might take my cut
of the fortune</i>

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:52.031
<i>out of your beautiful bride.</i>

01:08:52.032 --> 01:08:55.201
<i>Oh no!
Please stop!</i>

01:08:55.202 --> 01:08:57.453
No.

01:08:57.453 --> 01:08:59.497
<i>I'll never get out of it.
He's too good at tying knots.</i>

01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:01.582
<i>Damn.
You're gonna love it.</i>

01:09:01.582 --> 01:09:02.416
No.

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:05.670
<i>And insult to injury he's
raping my wife, crap!</i>

01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:10.671
<i>See? She loves it
you son of a bitch.</i>

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:16.510
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:19.350
<i>Gotta hand it to him.
The kid's got talent.</i>

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:24.350
<i>Maybe I was right...
wrong about him all along.</i>

01:09:36.158 --> 01:09:41.158
<i>Guess who?
actor.</i>

01:09:59.558 --> 01:10:03.102
You're not
fooling me, Rey.

01:10:03.103 --> 01:10:04.729
You just don't think
about what's best

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:09.358
for the movie, do you?

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:11.235
I'm going to take my cut
of what you owe me.

01:10:11.236 --> 01:10:14.238
All right, all right,
I'll do it.

01:10:14.239 --> 01:10:16.949
I'll cut you back in.

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:18.576
Did I blink?

01:10:23.373 --> 01:10:27.877
No. Rey, please...

01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:32.878
Help me, baby...

01:11:10.128 --> 01:11:15.128
s ow!

01:11:19.262 --> 01:11:21.430
Stop!

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:26.431
Where are you going?

01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:33.021
I gotta go.

01:11:34.069 --> 01:11:39.069
I'm really sorry
about that, okay? Bye.

01:11:41.076 --> 01:11:46.076
Cal and I are in love and
we're going to get married.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.665
And...

01:11:47.666 --> 01:11:50.167
Josephine...

01:11:50.168 --> 01:11:53.713
I'm sorry.

01:11:53.714 --> 01:11:58.714
I wish I could have been
a better wife to you.

01:11:59.428 --> 01:12:04.140
I'll always...

01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:07.184
I'll always love you.

01:12:07.185 --> 01:12:12.185
- Josephine, untie me.
- But I'm not in love with you.

01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:17.570
I have to go meet Cal.
He's waiting.

01:12:17.571 --> 01:12:19.739
Josephine.

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.740
Josephine!

01:13:03.492 --> 01:13:08.492
Tenebras quam luciem

01:13:09.331 --> 01:13:14.331
Tenebras quam luciem
tuam movendi est vita...

01:13:14.336 --> 01:13:19.336
What does it mean?

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.232
I 9°t you.

01:14:18.233 --> 01:14:20.651
Ugh. You dog!
You scared me.

01:14:20.652 --> 01:14:24.363
Oh, I was only
kidding, Jasmine.

01:14:24.364 --> 01:14:29.034
Come here,
why don't you?

01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:34.035
I want you to forgive me.

01:15:17.918 --> 01:15:20.169
I'm sorry.

01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:23.213
This hasn't happened
to me before.

01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:25.466
It's that damn editor.

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:27.843
I think I feel kind of bad
for what I did to him.

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:32.844
It's all right.
I'm good.

01:15:34.976 --> 01:15:36.852
Tell me.

01:15:36.853 --> 01:15:39.229
Tell me something about your
affair with the inspector.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:41.565
Like what?

01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:45.402
About how he was
strong and forceful.

01:15:45.403 --> 01:15:49.114
Okay, well he was
strong and forceful.

01:15:49.115 --> 01:15:51.867
Yeah.

01:15:51.868 --> 01:15:56.868
He knew what I wanted
before I did.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:00.751
Excuse me, Wizard!

01:16:00.752 --> 01:16:02.544
I must have a word with
you about the editor

01:16:02.545 --> 01:16:04.380
and your so-called superstition.

01:16:04.381 --> 01:16:06.757
I need a little help with the
Latin here but...

01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:08.884
Tenebras Quam Luciem
Tuam Movendi est Vita?

01:16:08.885 --> 01:16:13.885
You fool, you mustn't
say these words!

01:16:14.891 --> 01:16:17.101
It's just a bit of fire,
what's the big deal?

01:16:17.102 --> 01:16:21.313
No. You shouldn't have
brought this book here.

01:16:21.314 --> 01:16:23.482
It must be destroyed,
like the others.

01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:28.195
Wizard, come now.
It's just an old text.

01:16:28.196 --> 01:16:30.280
You're seeing ghosts
on every corner.

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.782
No, Inspector,
I beg of you.

01:16:31.783 --> 01:16:36.783
For your own salvation you
must destroy this book, please.

01:16:37.038 --> 01:16:39.039
You don't know what
you're toying with.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.959
I'll happily destroy it once
I find out what part

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.336
Rey Ciso plays in this
dark charade.

01:16:44.337 --> 01:16:47.214
I've known Rey for many years.

01:16:47.215 --> 01:16:50.509
He's got no part in the evil
that you've brought here.

01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:53.762
Rey Ciso's a
God-fearing Catholic.

01:16:53.763 --> 01:16:56.098
And he can patch up
more than a roll of film,

01:16:56.099 --> 01:16:57.891
let me tell you.

01:16:57.892 --> 01:17:00.602
Why, he patched up
our bell tower.

01:17:00.603 --> 01:17:04.106
It was all leaky and he
patched up the masonry

01:17:04.107 --> 01:17:06.734
and now it rings loud and clear.

01:17:09.779 --> 01:17:13.615
So, inspector,
I'll tell you again.

01:17:13.616 --> 01:17:18.616
Rey Ciso is not your man.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:22.958
Wizard, please!

01:17:22.959 --> 01:17:27.959
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with a friend.

01:18:17.972 --> 01:18:22.972
Oh, yeah.

01:18:26.564 --> 01:18:30.275
Yeah.

01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:15.070
<i>Come on, Rome.</i>

01:19:15.071 --> 01:19:18.824
Let's see if Cal likes you
as much as I do, eh?

01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:22.369
Twelve hours working the beat.
Who needs 'em, right?

01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.913
Here, let's get some exercise.

01:19:24.914 --> 01:19:27.708
Oh, what's this?

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:32.709
How about a little fetch
before we go swimming, huh?

01:19:33.006 --> 01:19:35.132
That's it, boy, get it.

01:19:35.133 --> 01:19:38.468
Get it.
Get it, that's a good boy.

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:43.469
Bring it. Bring it.
Oh you're such a good boy.

01:19:43.975 --> 01:19:48.975
<i>That's it Rome. Get it.
Bring it. Bring it, Rome.</i>

01:19:56.404 --> 01:20:01.404
Ca"

01:20:06.497 --> 01:20:09.166
No use in hiding, Ciso.
Come out right now.

01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:14.167
Are you in here, Rey?

01:20:44.661 --> 01:20:49.661
My God...

01:20:53.753 --> 01:20:57.172
No.

01:21:06.474 --> 01:21:11.474
Get a hold of yourself.

01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:16.521
What's this?

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:24.320
Ah, yes.

01:21:39.674 --> 01:21:44.674
Now I've got him.

01:23:46.884 --> 01:23:48.760
Oh, no you don't.

01:24:30.344 --> 01:24:33.513
Hold it right there, Editor.

01:24:33.514 --> 01:24:37.100
Thought you got
away from me, did you?

01:24:37.101 --> 01:24:41.188
To bring forth.
Summoning demons.

01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:43.440
A bunch of bullshit
some priest told me.

01:24:43.441 --> 01:24:45.400
I read your book.

01:24:45.401 --> 01:24:50.401
It's all so stupid it makes
me want to shoot you.

01:24:52.116 --> 01:24:57.116
Don't even think about it.

01:25:02.835 --> 01:25:07.835
Come back, Rey!

01:25:14.347 --> 01:25:19.347
Come on.
Eat it. Eat it.

01:25:19.727 --> 01:25:23.438
- Ah, fuck this.
- Francesco.

01:25:23.439 --> 01:25:25.857
I was beginning to think
you'd stood me up, my dear.

01:25:25.858 --> 01:25:30.858
Oh, darling,
you've known me long enough.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.200
His final victim.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.831
Hold it right there, Rey!

01:25:41.832 --> 01:25:43.250
Porfiry, you don't understand.

01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:45.335
No Rey, I think I
finally do understand.

01:25:45.336 --> 01:25:49.798
If I don't shoot you now
this is never going to end!

01:25:49.799 --> 01:25:51.841
It's all right Mrs. Ciso,
everything is

01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:53.760
going to be okay now.

01:25:53.761 --> 01:25:58.515
Porfiry, behind you.

01:25:58.516 --> 01:26:02.852
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

01:26:04.105 --> 01:26:06.314
It was you, all along?

01:26:06.315 --> 01:26:06.856
I knew it!

01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:11.857
Don't choke on your
last words, Inspector.

01:26:13.155 --> 01:26:14.573
Choke on this, bitch.

01:26:22.123 --> 01:26:23.665
Josephine.

01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:28.295
Josephine?
I've always hated that name.

01:26:28.296 --> 01:26:32.591
I've sacrificed
everything for you.

01:26:32.592 --> 01:26:36.094
From now on, call me Death!

01:26:36.095 --> 01:26:38.555
Death! Death!

01:26:38.556 --> 01:26:41.808
- Do it again, call me Death.
- Light the match, Rey.

01:26:41.809 --> 01:26:44.352
Come on, light the match.

01:26:44.353 --> 01:26:45.895
Come on, Rey.
Light the damn match!

01:26:45.896 --> 01:26:46.938
Death!

01:26:46.939 --> 01:26:49.774
Please, Rey. Do it!

01:26:49.775 --> 01:26:51.401
It's these damn wooden fingers!

01:26:51.402 --> 01:26:52.402
You're a wooden man!

01:26:52.403 --> 01:26:57.032
Death!

01:26:57.033 --> 01:27:00.619
Please, no!
N000!

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.621
Death! Death!

01:27:35.237 --> 01:27:40.237
- Ah. My back.
- Oh, your back, I'm sorry.

01:27:41.869 --> 01:27:44.287
You're a free man.

01:27:44.288 --> 01:27:46.873
I just don't understand it.

01:27:46.874 --> 01:27:50.043
Why she'd kill so many
innocent actors...

01:27:50.044 --> 01:27:52.504
Like Cesare or Margarit?

01:27:52.505 --> 01:27:55.632
Well, Cal killed Cesare.

01:27:55.633 --> 01:27:57.217
He told me.

01:27:57.218 --> 01:28:01.137
To get a better part
in the picture.

01:28:01.138 --> 01:28:03.306
Here, allow me.

01:28:03.307 --> 01:28:05.975
Ow! Damn, that's right.
I forgot.

01:28:05.976 --> 01:28:09.145
I don't have fingers on
this hand anymore.

01:28:09.146 --> 01:28:14.146
Thank you, Porfiry

01:28:15.069 --> 01:28:18.446
You'll be in my prayers tonight.
And now to bed.

01:28:18.447 --> 01:28:23.284
But Rey, you've been hit.

01:28:23.285 --> 01:28:28.285
It's all in a
day's work, partner.

01:28:37.133 --> 01:28:38.925
Porfiry, you're late.

01:28:38.926 --> 01:28:41.261
It's funny you mention
that, Chief, as I was

01:28:41.262 --> 01:28:43.513
about to tell you I'm
taking some time off.

01:28:43.514 --> 01:28:45.223
Vacation days?

01:28:45.224 --> 01:28:47.350
Look, I understand setting
somebody on fire

01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:49.561
and watching them burn to
death changes a man.

01:28:49.562 --> 01:28:52.230
But you've got to talk to the
staff doc about that, not me.

01:28:52.231 --> 01:28:53.815
Casini's waiting for you.

01:28:53.816 --> 01:28:55.108
Casini?

01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:56.860
Yeah, anytime you
kill somebody

01:28:56.861 --> 01:28:59.070
you gotta talk to the staff doc.

01:28:59.071 --> 01:29:01.489
Well, I'd be happy to talk
to him about the

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:03.950
charred remains of
Josephine Jardin.

01:29:03.951 --> 01:29:06.119
You know, Chief,
I met her once...

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.871
and although I found
her a cruel woman,

01:29:07.872 --> 01:29:09.205
I never would have
thought she

01:29:09.206 --> 01:29:11.332
would be capable of murder.

01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:12.959
I would have figured a
few good slaps from

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.461
her husband would
have sorted her out.

01:29:14.462 --> 01:29:16.880
Okay.
Didn't realize you knew her.

01:29:16.881 --> 01:29:18.673
She wasn't married though.

01:29:18.674 --> 01:29:21.509
Of course she was,
to the editor.

01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.012
Jesus Christ, this is the
kind of mumbo jumbo

01:29:24.013 --> 01:29:26.473
you should be babbling to
the staff doc, not me.

01:29:26.474 --> 01:29:29.184
You know, Chief,
you may be my superior

01:29:29.185 --> 01:29:31.311
but I'd expect a little
more respect for your

01:29:31.312 --> 01:29:35.690
top inspector on the heels
of cracking his big...

01:29:35.691 --> 01:29:38.735
I respect the hell out of
Inspector Giancarlo.

01:29:38.736 --> 01:29:40.695
I made him a bronze
shield this morning

01:29:40.696 --> 01:29:42.405
while you were in bed
sleeping off that

01:29:42.406 --> 01:29:44.949
pathetic hand wound of yours.

01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:46.826
Inspector Giancarlo?

01:29:46.827 --> 01:29:49.037
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:29:49.038 --> 01:29:51.706
My ears are burning.
Officer Porfiry.

01:29:51.707 --> 01:29:54.209
Is everything okay, Chief?

01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:57.712
You're dead.
You're dead.

01:29:57.713 --> 01:29:59.964
You're dead!

01:29:59.965 --> 01:30:03.468
Calm down. We have a lot
of things to discuss.

01:30:03.469 --> 01:30:05.762
You work in an asylum and,

01:30:05.763 --> 01:30:07.555
and you're dead and
that burnt up

01:30:07.556 --> 01:30:09.557
woman is the wife of Rey Ciso!

01:30:09.558 --> 01:30:12.602
Peter, relax.

01:30:12.603 --> 01:30:15.271
Nobody is going to hurt you.

01:30:15.272 --> 01:30:19.484
Rey Ciso is the editor!
The editor, I tell you!

01:30:19.485 --> 01:30:23.196
And I'm the inspector, not you.
Not Giancarlo!

01:30:23.197 --> 01:30:25.573
I'm the inspector.
This is my case.

01:30:25.574 --> 01:30:30.574
I'm the inspector.
I'm the inspector!

01:30:31.914 --> 01:30:34.207
Weird.

01:30:34.208 --> 01:30:39.208
Really weird.

01:30:42.508 --> 01:30:44.551
Where's the editor?
Is he here?

01:30:44.552 --> 01:30:46.135
- Who?
- The editor, damn it!

01:30:46.136 --> 01:30:47.762
I do not know of
whom you speak.

01:30:47.763 --> 01:30:50.807
Besides I know well enough to
avoid any editors or their ilk.

01:30:50.808 --> 01:30:52.892
He was here.
He fixed the bell tower.

01:30:52.893 --> 01:30:54.060
You said it!

01:30:54.061 --> 01:30:59.061
That bell hasn't rung in
over a hundred years.

01:30:59.525 --> 01:31:04.525
The bell tower.

01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:47.697
Non-

01:31:47.698 --> 01:31:50.658
Non-

01:31:50.659 --> 01:31:55.659
NOOOOOO!

01:34:43.957 --> 01:34:48.957
Honey, I'm in our home.
