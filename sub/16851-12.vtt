00:01.435 --> 00:04.138
(male narrator)
 Previously,
 on Children's Hospital.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.040
A sexy handicapped doctor.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.076
I'd like to show her
my sexy costume.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.344
No, no, Chief.
It's-it's me, Chet.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.680
Oh, my gosh.
Thank God.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.149
I'd like to take this
opportunity to invite myself

00:15.183 --> 00:16.684
to the wedding you're going to.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.519
- Oh, I don't--
- You can't say no.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.422
I know you've asked everybody
and you're in a real jam

00:21.455 --> 00:23.057
and you're afraid
of offending me.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.559
(whispering)
And I might also be dangerous.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.129
[laughing]

00:33.534 --> 00:34.835
This is actually an emergency.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.470
My-my daughter needs help now.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.306
Oh, okay.
Which one's your daughter again?

00:38.339 --> 00:40.341
- What do we got?
- Nine year old, unconscious.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.176
No sign of head
or spinal trauma--

00:42.210 --> 00:44.545
Hey, sick-person delivery boy,
not interested.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.448
Yeah. Someone get this
bald dildo out of here, huh?

00:47.481 --> 00:48.849
[all laugh]

00:48.882 --> 00:51.152
Imagine a dildo
without hair.

00:51.185 --> 00:54.122
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- You don't laugh with us.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.723
[all laugh]

00:55.756 --> 00:56.824
Still.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.329
- What is it that you wanted?
- I am begging you.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.397
My daughter needs treatment now.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.632
Doh! Watch where you're going!

01:04.665 --> 01:06.567
Sorry.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.170
[woman sighs]
This is ridiculous.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.343
- Hey, Chief.
- Oh, hey, Chuck.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.677
My name is Chet.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.147
Ahem, actually, I-I wanted
to ask you a question.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.383
Um, you put stuff
in your mouth, right?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.486
'Cause I know this cozy little
spot where we can sit across

01:25.519 --> 01:28.356
from each other, and you can
shove stuff in your mouth

01:28.389 --> 01:30.391
and I'll shove stuff
into my mouth.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.227
We'll bite down on it
a bunch of times like this..

01:33.261 --> 01:34.828
- Arr-Arr.
- Hey, Chimp.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.864
Your ambulance
is blocking my driveway.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.733
And your presence
is blocking my peace of mind.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.271
Could you move them both,
please? Thank you.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.240
(female #1)
'Stop saying it's okay.
It's not okay!'

01:46.274 --> 01:47.275
Okay. Okay.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.542
[clamoring]

01:48.576 --> 01:50.378
(female #1)
'Go now, get in there.'

01:50.411 --> 01:53.581
'Alright, I want you
to admit my daughter.'

01:53.614 --> 01:56.417
(Chet thinking)
 They say that there's someone
 out there for everyone.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.219
For every puzzle piece

01:58.252 --> 02:00.621
there's another one
 that fits it just right.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.458
But not for me.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.559
[engine revving]

02:05.593 --> 02:07.428
Some day a real storm will come

02:07.461 --> 02:09.896
and smash those
 puzzle pieces up.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.434
Then they'll be broken,
 just like me, and they'll--

02:13.467 --> 02:16.937
- Talking to yourself again?
- Oh, God! You scared me, Shane.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.839
You didn't ask "Chief" out,
did you?

02:18.872 --> 02:22.276
No, I tried to, but...
I got interrupted.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.812
When you want something,
you got to just take it.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.714
Well, I'm not like you, Shane.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.749
It's hard for me
to talk to girls.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.184
You know, that's your problem.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.453
You know, too much talk.
Not enough action.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.855
For instance,
Chet, I think you're beautiful.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.890
I'd really like
to go out with you.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.327
- What you talking about?
- Always been attracted to you.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.795
I'd make you feel so good.
Give me a chance.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.364
What?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.799
I'd love to put my hands
in those fine breasts.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.801
What? Stop it.
You're bad.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.770
You see what I did?

02:49.803 --> 02:52.773
Oh. Oh, wow.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.508
You were exuding
so much confidence

02:54.542 --> 02:56.544
you had me believing
I was a woman.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.312
(male #1 on radio)
'1-Arkin-12, 1-Arkin-12.'

02:58.346 --> 03:01.615
'We have a 21-19
on 212 Ipanema Drive. Copy.'

03:01.649 --> 03:03.484
Copy that, dispatch.
We're on our way.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.754
- I'll meet up with you later.
- You never go on calls with me.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.357
You just give me this advice
and then you leave.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.428
(Chet thinking)
 So I drive.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.963
Alone again.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.599
The life of a paramedic
 is a lonely one.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.570
Hi, I'm Chet.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.905
Is this your dad,
or your boyfriend?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.608
(male #1 on radio)
'1-Sandler-12, 1-Sandler-12.'

03:27.641 --> 03:29.577
'Can you go
to Grown Ups Hospital'

03:29.610 --> 03:31.712
'and pick up a cooler
of donor hearts?'

03:31.745 --> 03:33.647
Copy that, dispatch.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.517
[siren blaring]

03:38.986 --> 03:42.623
(Chet thinking)
 I tell myself I'd been given
 this job 'cause they trust me.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.459
I almost believe that only
 I can safely deliver a cooler

03:45.493 --> 03:47.528
full of human hearts
 to the empty chests

03:47.561 --> 03:49.297
of waiting patients.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.537
[grunting]

03:56.570 --> 03:57.971
Hyah.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.641
[screaming]

04:01.742 --> 04:03.311
[sobbing]

04:03.344 --> 04:04.745
[defibrillator charging]

04:04.778 --> 04:06.280
[defibrillator zaps]

04:16.557 --> 04:18.291
Suicide.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.694
The only answer.

04:20.728 --> 04:24.632
- Where we going?
- A-ah! Stop doing that.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.767
How'd you get in here
so quietly?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.936
Hey, you ask Chief out yet?

04:28.969 --> 04:31.905
No. And I never will
so just forget about it.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.741
Dude, go to the hospital.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.377
I'll hide in the closet
and feed you cool lines.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.011
- Like in that sitcom.
- No.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.448
I can't go to the hospital
without official business.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.317
Then let's make some
official business.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.419
You see that girl there?

04:45.453 --> 04:48.088
(Shane)
'Hit her with the ambulance
and we have official business.'

04:48.121 --> 04:49.990
- That's nuts.
- Chet, come on.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.025
This is your life.
Do it.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
(Shane)
'Take what's yours
by any means necessary!'

04:54.395 --> 04:55.729
'It's just a kid.'

04:55.763 --> 04:57.365
[engine revving]

05:03.604 --> 05:04.572
[girl screams]

05:08.008 --> 05:09.076
Holy crap.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.845
Oh-h!

05:11.879 --> 05:14.081
Oh, my.. I didn't think
you'd actually do it.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.049
This is crazy.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.353
- Just help me with this kid.
- I can't. I'm out of here.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.988
You know what?
I'm starting to understand

05:21.021 --> 05:23.424
why you suddenly have
to leave all the time.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.658
You're imaginary.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.595
- What?
- You're imaginary.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.597
It all makes sense now.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.401
A-ah!
Stop doing that.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
How'd you get in here
so quietly?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.070
You had me believing
I was a woman.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.707
I'm starting to understand
why you leave all the time.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.009
You're imaginary.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.077
It all makes sense now.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.448
You're an imaginary friend
that I made up because..

05:47.481 --> 05:49.450
...I'm crazy.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.553
You're the projection
of the self I wish I was.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.021
That's why you can't help me.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.457
No. I can't help you
because I'm on probation

05:56.490 --> 05:58.992
and I have some ecstasy
in my sock.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.495
I don't need you anymore.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.168
Okay.
Let's get you in the back.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.504
[blood spurts]
That's okay.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.874
1-Carolla-12 to dispatch.
I am coming in.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.511
[humming]

06:17.545 --> 06:18.746
[siren blaring]

06:20.748 --> 06:22.716
As you can see,
several people..

06:26.954 --> 06:28.689
...What are you doing
back there?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.459
[clamoring]

06:32.493 --> 06:33.827
Where's Chief?

06:34.795 --> 06:35.896
[gunshot]

06:35.929 --> 06:37.465
[all screaming]

06:41.469 --> 06:43.871
Do a C-Spine
and give me an amp of D50.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.706
- His pulse-ox is dropping.
- We're losing him.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.575
Wait. We shouldn't
be wasting all these

06:47.608 --> 06:49.510
cool medical terms
on this guy.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.878
- 'We're almost out.'
- 'Yes.'

06:50.911 --> 06:53.113
Yeah. I am getting
pretty bored, anyway.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.883
Fun day, though, right?
All this hostage stuff?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
(Valerie)
'Oh, and the towel fight
this morning.'

06:57.951 --> 06:59.620
- Oh, my God.
- Awesome.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.088
- You're naughty.
- 'I knew it.'

07:01.121 --> 07:04.057
Yeah. Goodbye, guy
we don't really care about.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.759
- Bye-bye.
- See ya.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.198
[heartbeat slowing]

07:15.268 --> 07:17.505
[Chet gasping]

07:17.538 --> 07:19.239
- I'm gonna save you, buddy.
- No.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.209
You can't save me.
You're not real.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.612
Only I can save myself..

07:24.645 --> 07:26.013
...by killing you.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.548
Huh?

07:27.581 --> 07:30.551
I have to kill
the imaginary part of me.

07:30.584 --> 07:34.154
Only then...
will I truly be free.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.757
No, Chet.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.828
- Now we're both free.
- Chet, no.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.095
[gunshot]

07:44.131 --> 07:46.734
Oh, my God.
That paramedic just shot Shane.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.670
No. Shane's the coolest dude
at Childrens.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.706
- 'Oh God, come on.'
- 'Let's help him.'

07:52.740 --> 07:55.108
'Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.
No, no, no.'

07:55.142 --> 07:56.677
Crap.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.547
I don't need you anymore.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.091
Suicide.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.660
The only answer.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.127
- Where we going?
- Oh!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.597
Someone get this bald dildo
out of here, huh?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.566
[laughing]

08:18.599 --> 08:20.200
You can shove stuff
in your mouth

08:20.233 --> 08:22.102
and I'll shove stuff
into my mouth.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.606
Then we'll bite down on it a
bunch of times like this, arr.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.844
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

08:30.878 --> 08:34.214
I'm sorry. I totally thought
you were... not real.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.916
Oh, it's okay, dude.

08:35.948 --> 08:41.121
Sometimes, I come off as fake
because I like to par-tay..

08:43.056 --> 08:44.592
(Cat)
'No.'

08:44.625 --> 08:46.627
Okay. Clear.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.030
No.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.739
[Chet groaning]

08:58.772 --> 09:00.908
Hey. There you are.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.810
We were getting worried
about you.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.078
- Who else?
- Well, just me.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.347
Everybody else is kinda mad
'cause you killed Shane.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.950
- Oh, yeah.
- But I missed you.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.285
I missed you too, Chief.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.188
Hey, maybe sometime you
and I could go get some food.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.625
Put it in our mouths,
like you could put--

09:17.658 --> 09:19.960
Shut up, Chaps.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.295
Hey.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.365
Dummy, when are they taking
you to jail? We need this bed.

09:25.398 --> 09:31.038
Hey! This business
is between me and Chief.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.907
Chief?
Uh, who's Chief?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.748
You didn't ask "Chief" out,
did you?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.182
I shove stuff in my mouth.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.652
She's not real, dude.
No one's there.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.692
[screaming]

10:03.403 --> 10:06.339
[instrumental music]

10:08.976 --> 10:11.378
(Sal Viscuso)
'Please tell him
that he's my best friend.'

10:11.411 --> 10:13.914
'That is all.'

10:13.947 --> 10:15.916
[music continues]
