WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:06.441
- Here we go.
Nice easy swing, okay?

00:06.484 --> 00:07.790
Keep your eye on it
the whole time.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.575
Ready?
- Yeah.

00:10.619 --> 00:13.491
- It's okay.
Don't get down on yourself.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.667
All right, you just got
to be patient, okay?

00:15.711 --> 00:17.191
Be patient.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.411
Oh, so close, dude.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.847
It's okay.
You just swing a little hard.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.458
You ready?

00:23.501 --> 00:25.286
Boom!
There you go!

00:25.329 --> 00:26.722
- Yeah.
- Great grip.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.158
- Score!
- Yeah, come on!

00:28.202 --> 00:29.333
There you go.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.074
You killed it today, dude.
- Thanks.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.163
- Yeah, man.
How are things at home?

00:33.207 --> 00:35.165
- They're okay.
- All right, good.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.862
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Angela.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.255
- Hi!

00:38.299 --> 00:40.083
- You know, you got yourself
a big leaguer here.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.651
- Just like I told you, Jim.
- Yeah.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.261
- You had fun?
- Yeah, I did.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.697
- Yeah, he was
crushing it today.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.482
- Why don't you go put
your things in the car?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.179
- Okay.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.008
- Thanks.
- Yeah, any time.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.879
Hey, listen, uh,
for groceries, okay?

00:53.923 --> 00:56.143
- Oh, no.
Put that away.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.927
- What?
- I got it.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.146
- That job come through?

00:59.189 --> 01:01.539
- Something like that.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.628
- All right, good.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.065
All right,
see you tomorrow, buddy.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.981
- Bobby's spending the week
in Detroit with his cousins.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.157
- Oh, no.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.636
Don't let them turn you
into a Tigers fan.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.421
- I won't.
- All right, good.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.205
All right,
I'll see you soon.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.554
Be good, okay?
- Bye.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.904
- See you guys.
- Bye.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.486
- You following me?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.358
- Well, that's what happens

01:37.401 --> 01:38.837
when you keep lying
to your partner.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.404
- I lied to you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.537
Last week, you said
she was an unwitting.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.234
So I did my due diligence.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.106
- Oh, you did.
- Mm-hmm.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.281
I know who she is.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.934
The question is,
does she know who you are?

01:48.978 --> 01:50.980
- No, she doesn't,
but it's okay.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.460
I know what I'm doing.
- Jay...

01:52.503 --> 01:54.418
- Hailey, I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.290
I'm just helping out
a family that got screwed.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.771
- If she finds out who you are,
we're all screwed.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.643
You've got to walk away
from this one.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.344
- Okay.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.651
- Hang on.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.305
Voight.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.133
There's a body in Englewood.
He wants us on scene.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.917
- All right.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.185
- Hey.
- So the fun started in here?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.969
- Yeah.
- Where's the DOA?

02:24.013 --> 02:25.275
- In the back.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.843
- Make an ID?
- Jose Santiago, corner boy.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.671
- Why did we get invited
to the party?

02:29.714 --> 02:31.281
- Oh, you'll see.

02:32.587 --> 02:33.762
- Whoa.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.637
- All right, Crawford wants
all hands on deck.

02:39.681 --> 02:42.771
Obviously, whoever did this
was looking for answers.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.165
Jay, help Kevin and Rojas
work the block.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.255
You and Hailey hit the streets,
find security video.

02:49.473 --> 02:54.043
Adam, find out
who this Jose is.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.610
All right,
let's try and figure out

02:55.653 --> 02:57.481
why someone would do this
to a kid like that.

02:57.525 --> 03:00.397
All right, it's all yours.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.665
- Hailey...

03:07.709 --> 03:09.363
I've got to take off
for a few minutes.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.147
- What do you mean?
We've got work to do.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.410
- Yeah, it won't take long.
Let's not talk about it here.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.238
- Okay, do what you got to do.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.153
- Okay.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.418
- Hey, Sarge,
no luck on the videos.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.638
- Huh.
Where's Halstead going?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.335
- Uh, he's just
got to take care

03:25.379 --> 03:26.902
of something
that's personal.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.208
- Something you wanna tell me?

03:30.297 --> 03:32.037
- Jay's going through
a few things.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.214
Um, he's working it out.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.217
- Something you don't
wanna tell me?

03:38.392 --> 03:42.439
- Yeah, but it's
not my place, so...

03:42.483 --> 03:44.528
- Hailey, I respect what
you're trying to do here,

03:44.572 --> 03:46.095
but if there's something
I need to know...

03:46.138 --> 03:47.488
- There isn't.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.967
Not yet anyway.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.057
- Okay, I take you
at your word.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.783
- Hello?

04:23.132 --> 04:25.352
You here?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.310
You okay?

04:40.018 --> 04:42.325
- Oh, man,
I'm not communicating well.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.979
I just--I want you to know that

04:44.022 --> 04:45.850
I know that you're working
through a lot,

04:45.894 --> 04:48.418
and I want you to know that,
you know,

04:48.462 --> 04:50.028
whatever you decide,
I'm okay with.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.421
If you wanna talk about it,

04:51.465 --> 04:52.466
if you don't wanna
talk about it.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.902
Hey, just--

04:53.945 --> 04:57.297
I'm here for you.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.211
Okay.

04:59.255 --> 05:02.258
Thank you, I do appreciate it.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.129
It's just--you know.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.827
- Yeah.
Sorry, I was...

05:05.870 --> 05:07.872
- No, it's good.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.961
Just...

05:10.005 --> 05:11.963
- Yeah.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.617
- Jay, third message.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.184
I was annoyed
after the first two.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.274
Now I'm getting worried.
Call me as soon as you can.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.841
Hey, have you guys
heard from Jay?

05:19.884 --> 05:21.059
- No.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.539
- We were supposed
to get beers last night,

05:22.583 --> 05:24.367
but he never texted me back.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.978
- Hey, is Halstead
on a UC run?

05:27.022 --> 05:28.197
- Not that I know about.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.459
- State's Attorney
is all over me.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.243
He's supposed to be
in court right now.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.593
- Hailey, you know anything?

05:32.636 --> 05:34.072
- No, I called him
a few times, but--

05:34.116 --> 05:35.335
- I did too.
No answer.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.901
So I ran the GPS on his truck.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.990
It's parked on a street
in Englewood.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.688
- How long has it been there?
- All night.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.690
I ran the in-service calls
to that block.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.648
There were two calls
of suspicious persons

05:44.692 --> 05:46.171
at a house on that street.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.347
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Yeah.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.000
- Check it out.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.360
- Looks clear.
- Check the glove box.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.456
- He left his badge and gun.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.110
- So he went undercover.

06:18.856 --> 06:19.901
- Adam.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.949
Ready?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.516
Chicago PD!

06:26.560 --> 06:28.431
Anyone inside?

06:28.475 --> 06:29.954
- Jay, call out!

06:29.998 --> 06:31.216
- Hold.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.392
Move.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.092
- Living room clear.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.137
- Got blood!

06:47.145 --> 06:48.451
- Stairs.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.803
Cover me.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.370
Clear.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.939
- Adam, opening up.
- Copy that.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.949
- More blood.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.605
- Jesus.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.956
What?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.482
You recognize them?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.268
- There's a shell casing.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.273
- The whole house
is torn apart.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.971
- They came here looking
for something or someone.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.668
Jay must've got caught
in the middle of it.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.975
- Found a .38 shell casing
on the kitchen floor.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.237
- Do we have a name?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.934
- Angela Nelson.
She lives here with her son.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.501
She's got one prior
for possession.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
- She on Jay's books as a CI?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
- No.
- Hey.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.507
A neighbor over there
saw two Latino men

07:44.551 --> 07:46.074
casing the house last night.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.598
Later on, he thought he heard
gunshots, but wasn't sure.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.252
- All right, Jay is missing.

07:50.295 --> 07:53.037
I want every agency on alert.
- Sarge, we can't do that.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.518
- What the hell
are you talking about?

07:57.172 --> 08:00.305
- The woman who lives
in that house, Angela Nelson,

08:00.349 --> 08:02.569
she was married to Marcus West.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.920
- Marcus West, the addict
who got killed at County?

08:05.963 --> 08:09.576
- Yeah.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.665
I think Jay still blames
himself for that.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.755
He's been seeing her.
Not romantically.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.800
He's been spending time
with her and her son Bobby

08:16.844 --> 08:18.062
trying to help them out.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.282
- So Jay went to see
Angela yesterday.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.981
You know why he came here?
- No.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.070
He's been playing everything
real close to the vest,

08:26.114 --> 08:27.681
hasn't said a word.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.639
But she did send him
a text message yesterday

08:29.683 --> 08:31.554
before he took off saying,
"Jim, I need your help.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.816
Please come over."

08:32.860 --> 08:34.339
- All right,
I'll talk to the others.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.559
Let 'em know what's going on.
I mean, you're right.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.692
We've got to keep
this in-house, off book.

08:40.563 --> 08:41.956
This whole thing kicked off

08:41.999 --> 08:44.567
with the murder of those
two boys a few months back.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
Jay liked Marcus West
for the crimes.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.790
So he got a little aggressive,
booked him into County.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.966
You know, make him nervous,
leverage a confession.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.577
- It's not Jay's fault that
the facial rec was inaccurate.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.971
I mean, the evidence pointed to
Marcus killing those two kids.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.581
- Yeah, well, except he didn't,

08:58.625 --> 09:00.322
and Marcus wound up dead.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.674
Jay had a hard time
swallowing it, so...

09:04.718 --> 09:06.720
you know,
he tried to make it right,

09:06.763 --> 09:08.591
help out the family.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.638
But this isn't about that

09:11.681 --> 09:14.554
or about what happened
to Marcus in County.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.686
It's about finding Jay.

09:17.731 --> 09:20.864
For now, this stays in-house,
off book.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.258
But I wanna know everything
there is to know

09:23.301 --> 09:24.868
about Angela Nelson.

09:24.912 --> 09:28.611
We find her, we find Jay.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.357
- I'm gonna ask you again.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.577
Where's the heroin you and
your girl stole from me, Jim?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.230
- I told you, man.
I got no idea.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.275
I got no idea.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.972
- If I were you,
I'd come up with it.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.539
- Stop it!

09:43.583 --> 09:45.715
Please!
- Maybe she's right, man.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.761
- Shut up!

09:52.983 --> 09:54.724
Angela...

09:54.768 --> 09:56.639
Do you wanna die down here?
- No.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.902
- Then tell me where
you got our stuff, huh?

09:58.946 --> 10:00.643
Carlos has it, right?
Where is he hiding it?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
- Please!
I swear!

10:02.689 --> 10:04.168
- You're not gonna tell me
where he's hiding?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.561
- I don't know.
I don't know where it is.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.736
We didn't steal nothing.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.433
- Stop, man.
She doesn't know!

10:08.477 --> 10:10.261
She doesn't know!

10:10.305 --> 10:13.090
- I swear, I'm gonna kick your
ass when I get out of here.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.222
- Tough girl?

10:14.265 --> 10:16.659
Huh?
I like that.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.269
Tougher the better.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.452
- Ven conmigo.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.767
- Angela...

10:37.811 --> 10:39.247
I need to know what the hell
is going on.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.901
Did you steal their drugs?

10:40.944 --> 10:43.164
Did you steal
their drugs?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.690
- Yeah...

10:53.870 --> 10:55.698
- My friend Carlos told me

10:55.742 --> 10:57.613
he'd give me ten grand
to drive.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.140
So I did it.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.839
Drove him to that house
over on Sutton,

11:05.882 --> 11:07.797
but he never showed up
to pay me.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.191
I tried calling him,
but he wasn't picking up.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.803
So I didn't know if he
was ripping me off

11:13.847 --> 11:15.849
or something happened to him.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.765
- So you texted me.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.418
- Yeah.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.812
I was getting nervous.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.989
- Whose drugs did you steal?

11:26.033 --> 11:28.862
- I don't know.
I just drove.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.171
I needed the money.

11:34.215 --> 11:37.044
Since Marcus passed,
things have gotten bad.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.177
I'm late on the rent.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.572
Bobby's sickle-cell
is getting worse.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.183
So I just agreed
I'd help Carlos.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.448
He said it would be the easiest
ten grand I ever saw.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.805
I'm sorry, Jim.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.546
I didn't mean to drag you
into all of this.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.158
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.075
I'm gonna get us out of here.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.773
Okay?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.215
- So we got details back
on Angela's movements

12:18.259 --> 12:19.695
two days ago.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.305
Pings on her phone put her
at Sutton Street and 150th

12:21.349 --> 12:22.785
at 6:00 p.m.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.613
- Which is the same time that
we got a shots fired call

12:24.656 --> 12:25.788
over the 8th District zone.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.572
So I went down there,
found a doorbell cam

12:27.616 --> 12:29.531
that's across the street
from a stash house.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.751
That's Angela's car, and that's
her behind the wheel.

12:31.794 --> 12:36.059
And that guy looks like he's
carrying a bag full of bricks.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.539
- Patrol found a dead John Doe

12:37.582 --> 12:39.236
and an empty drug trap
on the floor.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.716
The John Doe is a Latino
in his '20s,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.371
GSW to the head.
No ID found on him.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.721
Area South is doing the case.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.679
- Which means they may know
what we know

12:47.723 --> 12:49.072
and are already out
in front of this.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.813
- Which is obviously not good.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.467
- We got anything
on the stick-up man?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.077
- Yeah,
facial rec picked him up.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.818
His name is Carlos Diaz.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.385
He's got three priors
for possession

12:57.428 --> 12:58.865
and an armed robbery kicker.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.650
And get this,
his last known is the apartment

13:01.693 --> 13:03.347
where Jose Santiago
was tortured.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.914
- He and Carlos
are roommates.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.437
- So...

13:06.481 --> 13:09.005
Whoever's drugs got ripped
went looking for Carlos,

13:09.049 --> 13:10.659
found Jose instead.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.748
All right, what else do
we know about this Carlos?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.532
- Well, we know
he can't be too smart.

13:14.576 --> 13:15.838
I've been pinging his phone
all day.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.274
Dummy never shut it off.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.581
Right now, he's hiding out
in a flophouse in Gage Park.

13:19.624 --> 13:20.712
- All right,
let's scoop him up.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.237
Nice and quiet.
You two.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.332
- Ready?
- Yep.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
- Carlos Diaz,
Chicago PD!

13:52.614 --> 13:54.007
Put your hands
where we can see them!

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
He's cold.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.508
Been here for a while.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.119
Let's call it in.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.995
- All right,
tell me what happened.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.692
- Carlos Diaz, overdose.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.781
M.E. says he's been dead
for at least half a day.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.740
- Ah, bingo.
Got it.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.916
- That's the bag we saw get
tossed into Angela's car.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.657
- All right,
so Carlos stole the drugs,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.093
started using,
wound up dead?

14:37.137 --> 14:38.834
- Probably not used
to this good of quality.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.531
- All right, run those bricks
for latent prints

14:40.575 --> 14:41.663
and test that gun.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.056
See if the markings
match the bullets

14:43.099 --> 14:45.362
that popped our John Doe
at the stash house.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.322
Listen, we keep digging
into Carlos.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.063
The fact he's dead
changes nothing.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.587
'Cause whoever Carlos
and Angela ripped off,

14:52.630 --> 14:54.850
that's who has Jay.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
- It ain't working.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.555
How you doing?
How bad is it?

15:05.339 --> 15:06.949
- I can handle it.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.912
Maybe I should tell them
the truth.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.351
About what we did,
about Carlos.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.526
- No.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.875
The only reason
we're still alive

15:19.919 --> 15:21.833
is because they think
we know where the drugs are.

15:21.877 --> 15:22.791
Okay?

15:22.834 --> 15:25.054
Stick to the story,
stay strong.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.928
- That's what Marcus
used to say.

15:31.495 --> 15:35.064
He gets laid off,
stay strong.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.545
When we ain't got no money
for groceries,

15:37.588 --> 15:40.069
stay strong.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.506
Joke is...

15:42.550 --> 15:44.769
Marcus was the one
who was weak.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.510
Couldn't stay off those drugs.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.602
Maybe if I was stronger,

15:51.646 --> 15:53.604
we could've gotten
him straight.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.216
Then none of this
would've happened.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.000
- No, don't do that.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.090
Marcus dying is not on you.
You didn't kill him.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.095
We can't think about Marcus
or the past right now.

16:06.139 --> 16:09.055
You've gotta--you've gotta
just stay focused.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.578
Okay?

16:10.621 --> 16:12.580
Not if we want to survive.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.588
- Okay.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.068
- Techs just found
a second set of prints

16:22.111 --> 16:23.460
on the bricks of heroin.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.940
Pedro Silva.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.942
Been popped
three times for distro

16:26.986 --> 16:28.639
along with
a couple weapon charges.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.337
- All right,
what flag does he fly?

16:30.380 --> 16:32.382
- He's more of a lone wolf,
works with family.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.210
His wife was killed
five years ago in a drive-by,

16:34.254 --> 16:36.386
left Silva raising
his three sons on his own.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.779
Two of them work
for the old man.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.520
- This is Hector Silva.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.870
Did four years in Stateville,
drug distribution.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.003
He spent most of his time in
the hole.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.830
Got in a few jams.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.919
I mean, he almost beat a guy
to death with a barbell.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.399
- This is the middle brother,
Luis.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.662
Pinched twice for possession,
no history of violence.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.055
- And the other one?
- That's Emilio.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.970
Still in high school,
honor student, no priors.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.190
- The two older brothers match
the eyewitness description

16:57.233 --> 16:58.539
that the neighbor gave us.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.628
- All right, we got
an address on Pedro Silva?

17:00.671 --> 17:01.890
- Uh, yeah.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.545
Uh, LKA is a house
on Hegewisch.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.633
- All right, Kev,
you and Rojas,

17:05.676 --> 17:07.200
get a bead on those
two brothers.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.505
The rest of you,
with me.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.116
- Mm-hmm.
Good to go.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.769
- Yeah.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.515
- All right, let me know
when you're in position.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.169
- Copy.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.309
- Chicago PD,
get your hands up!

17:29.352 --> 17:30.484
- You Emilio?

17:30.527 --> 17:31.572
- Yes, ma'am.
What's going on?

17:31.615 --> 17:32.660
- Emilio, anybody inside?

17:32.703 --> 17:33.922
- No.
- You sure?

17:33.965 --> 17:35.184
- I swear.
- Come downstairs.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.707
Keep your hands up.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.622
- Where's your dad, Emilio?
We're looking for him.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.102
- I don't know.
I just got home from school.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
- What about your brothers?
Where are they?

17:41.843 --> 17:43.845
- Working, I guess.
I don't see them much.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.369
- Okay, take a deep breath.
It's okay.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.155
- I don't think he's involved.
- Yeah, well, let's find out.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.331
You two go inside with him,
clear the house,

17:51.374 --> 17:52.462
then bring him in.

17:52.506 --> 17:53.768
We'll dump his phone,

17:53.811 --> 17:55.813
see if he's been in contact
with the old man.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.598
Get up.
Come on.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.255
- It's okay.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.430
- Listen, I talked to Kev.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.779
- Anything on the two
older brothers?

18:04.822 --> 18:05.910
- Yeah, they're in the wind.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.477
I checked their place
in Little Village,

18:07.521 --> 18:08.609
a girlfriend's place
in Pilsen.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.697
Looks like they went dark

18:09.740 --> 18:10.959
as soon as those drugs
went missing.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.308
- That means they're involved.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.701
Tell them to keep looking.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.964
- Well, it might be easier
to talk to Darius Walker.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.748
Turns out the old man,
Pedro, he got popped

18:17.792 --> 18:19.141
for a weapons charge
a year ago.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.143
Darius was the one
who bailed him out.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.494
- I'll meet you back
at the District.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.235
- Copy that, Boss.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.288
- Why are you interested
in Pedro Silva?

18:35.331 --> 18:36.680
- You know where to find him?

18:36.724 --> 18:39.074
- I got his number.
- You in business with him?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.032
- Not the type you think.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.557
Uh, Pedro's got his hooks

18:43.600 --> 18:46.212
into some property I'm after
in Little Village.

18:46.255 --> 18:49.389
- Look, all I need is an intro.
That's it.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.086
- He keeps a low profile.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.044
- You tell him he better raise
his profile

18:53.088 --> 18:54.568
if he wants to get
his drugs back.

18:56.222 --> 19:00.617
- Look, I got long-term plans
with this man.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.577
It took time to build
something real.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.145
I can't risk that.
- Darius...

19:07.102 --> 19:09.060
I need this now.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.152
Call him.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.593
- Why do I get the feeling

19:19.636 --> 19:22.248
that you're not telling me
everything about this?

19:22.291 --> 19:24.902
- Because I'm not.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.774
- I figured.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.825
So where were you locked up?

19:36.218 --> 19:37.306
- You don't got
to test me, bro,

19:37.350 --> 19:38.612
I'm obviously good at this.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.223
- Pedro's solid, so...

19:41.267 --> 19:44.139
- Let's not talk about
how solid he is.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.272
He got one of mine.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.670
- I should've said something

19:53.714 --> 19:55.977
the second I knew Jay was
hanging out with Angela.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.762
- He was trying to help
a mom and her kid

19:58.806 --> 19:59.807
down on their luck.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.722
There's nothing wrong
with that.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.856
The only problem is being
decent and being a good cop.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.643
It's not always
a perfect marriage.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.645
- Yeah.

20:11.688 --> 20:14.561
Sometimes you've got to swallow
all your pain and guilt,

20:14.604 --> 20:16.650
move on.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.489
- Silva just arrived.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.881
He's outside
of the parking lot,

20:30.925 --> 20:32.448
black Lexus.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.798
Unknown driver
in the vehicle.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.017
- Copy.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.193
Should we put a tracker on it?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.803
- Not with Silva sitting
in the car.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.241
- Sarge, if this goes south,
that's our only hope.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.981
- Hailey,
I said it's too dangerous.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.684
- Here's your boy.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.476
- Pedro, thanks for coming.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.217
- Yeah.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.221
- Keyshawn.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.703
- Pedro, I appreciate you.
Let's get right to it.

21:09.746 --> 21:12.358
My boy Jimmy and Angela
violated.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.185
He got involved with some stuff

21:14.229 --> 21:17.014
he had no business
getting involved in.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.451
I just wanna
make peace with you.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.322
- It's going to take
a lot to make peace.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.890
My cousin got killed
in that house.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.675
- I hate to hear that,
and I'm sorry.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.503
That's exactly why I'm here
to make it right.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.418
- How are you gonna do that,
Keyshawn?

21:29.462 --> 21:30.724
- First thing I'm gonna do

21:30.767 --> 21:32.378
is give you back everything
that's yours.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.947
Jim and Angela had no idea
what they were doing,

21:36.991 --> 21:38.514
who they were doing it to.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.821
They got played by a punk-ass
wannabe gangster, Carlos.

21:40.864 --> 21:41.952
- Yeah, I know.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.867
I'm looking for him.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.347
- I know.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.393
I already took care
of him for you.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.047
He in the ground.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.788
- How do you know that?

21:51.832 --> 21:53.921
- 'Cause that's
where I put him.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.406
That looks like your product,
right?

22:02.538 --> 22:04.540
Not a gram is missing.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.237
Allow me to give it back
to you.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.718
I'll throw in an extra 50k.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.720
That's out of respect
for your loss.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.244
All I need you to do is hand
over Jim and Angela.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.724
- I'll think about it.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.379
- Hey, come on now.
You can't just leave like that.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.076
- Excuse me?

22:19.120 --> 22:21.078
- I need you to tell me
that my people are good.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.384
- You don't tell me what to do.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.081
- If you don't give me proof
that they're good,

22:24.125 --> 22:25.387
then there's no deal.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.910
- Okay, let's take it down.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.303
Let's take it down.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.218
Pedro...

22:30.261 --> 22:31.611
listen, the man's got a point.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.961
He just wants to make sure
his people are good.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.410
- Put him on the phone.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.679
- Talk.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.465
- You got Jim.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.773
- Jim, what the hell
did I tell you

23:03.817 --> 23:05.862
about grabbing
what's not yours?

23:05.906 --> 23:07.386
- I messed up, man.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.300
I'm sorry.
- Damn right you did.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.606
But we're gonna
get the drugs back,

23:10.650 --> 23:12.782
then we're gonna get you back.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.697
You hang tight.
- Okay, good?

23:15.872 --> 23:18.658
- Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

23:18.701 --> 23:21.965
- Let's meet at 4:00 p.m.
I'll text you a place.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.454
- That looks like
it's getting worse.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.369
- It is.
She needs a hospital.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.457
- You want a doctor?

23:35.501 --> 23:36.980
Is that what you want,
sweetheart?

23:37.024 --> 23:38.982
How about I give you a kiss?
That'll make you feel better.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.376
- Just leave her alone.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.165
- Shut up, bitch!

23:53.736 --> 23:56.130
- Yeah?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.479
Hold on.
I can't talk.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.092
I'm gonna be back,
tough girl.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.008
It's gonna be fun too.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
- What was that call about?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.670
- My friend has their drugs.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.150
He's gonna bring them up
to them

24:16.193 --> 24:18.369
and they're gonna let us go.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.067
- Okay, what?

24:20.110 --> 24:22.461
How did your people know
where to find the dope

24:22.504 --> 24:24.550
or Carlos?
- Don't worry about it.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.421
The point is just to get
the hell out of here, okay?

24:26.465 --> 24:29.163
Focus on that.
Nothing else, okay?

24:29.206 --> 24:30.512
We're getting out of here.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.617
- It's 4:12.
Silva's late.

24:48.661 --> 24:49.836
- Just stay patient,

24:49.879 --> 24:51.664
and keep your head on
a swivel.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.061
- Sarge, what's this?

25:05.242 --> 25:07.593
Just a small construction crew.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.508
- Let it play.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.858
- 10-4.
Maintaining a solid eye on Kev.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.518
- Over there.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.131
Silva is the passenger.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.480
- All right, heads up.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.135
Got a cargo van
heading your way.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.074
- About damn time.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.296
Where the hell is
Jim and Angela?

25:59.340 --> 26:01.385
- They're in the van,
they're nice and comfy,

26:01.429 --> 26:03.431
and they're gonna stay there
until I see my product.

26:03.474 --> 26:05.085
- Let me take a look at
how comfortable they are

26:05.128 --> 26:06.565
to make sure that
you're all good.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.655
- You will see them
after I see my product.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.015
- You stay right there,
home boy.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
This is it.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.894
It's all there.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.769
It's all you, man.

26:36.812 --> 26:39.032
Okay?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.773
Now it's your turn.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.037
- We're good.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.647
- Gun!

26:50.478 --> 26:52.698
- Silva, freeze!

26:52.741 --> 26:54.656
- Got one offender down.
Silva's fleeing on foot.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.658
He's headed right for you,
Sarge.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.327
- Step out!

27:13.370 --> 27:15.546
Step out before
I light your ass up!

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
Turn around.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.333
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.030
Jay and Angela
are not in the car.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.163
Repeat, we do not have Jay.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.165
- Where is he?
Get your hands up.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.254
Hands up!
Where is he?

27:27.297 --> 27:28.385
- Go to hell!

27:28.429 --> 27:30.344
- He's a cop.
He's one of us.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.520
Anything happens to him,
that's capital murder.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.696
Now where is he?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.567
- Sarge.

27:39.353 --> 27:42.225
- Hailey, not here.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.536
- You better pray to God
he's still alive.

27:48.579 --> 27:50.103
Put your hands
behind your back.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.718
- Come on, this deal
was supposed to happen by now.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.981
- I know.
We just gotta be patient, okay?

27:59.025 --> 28:00.853
Just gotta be patient.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.724
- I draw the young one close.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.770
Kick him, bite him,

28:04.813 --> 28:07.686
maybe his knife falls out,
you grab it.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.993
- No, that's a bad idea.

28:11.037 --> 28:14.649
- I don't wanna die
in this basement.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.782
- I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

28:18.305 --> 28:20.829
- Maybe I deserved this.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.527
- What are you saying?

28:23.571 --> 28:26.400
- I knew Marcus
was having problems,

28:26.443 --> 28:30.404
but I just kept hoping
and praying that he'd change.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.319
But he just got worse,

28:32.362 --> 28:34.277
killed two little boys.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.242
I've had nightmares
about those boys,

28:42.285 --> 28:43.939
their mothers.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.556
I don't care if I live, Jim.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.951
Live, die.
What difference does it make?

28:55.995 --> 28:58.301
- Hey.

28:58.345 --> 29:02.262
You've got a son.
He needs you.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.481
- Does he?

29:04.525 --> 29:07.876
Everybody knows that his daddy
killed those two little boys.

29:09.312 --> 29:12.228
His mom is a mess.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.405
Maybe he's better off
living down in North Carolina

29:15.449 --> 29:17.712
with his uncle.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.592
- Angela, Marcus didn't kill
those two kids.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.465
- What?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.206
What are you saying?

29:37.297 --> 29:39.212
- I'm a cop.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.782
- The hell are you
talking about?

29:43.825 --> 29:47.133
- I'm a cop.
That's how I met Marcus.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.961
I arrested him.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.452
- Uh, you done?

30:02.496 --> 30:04.063
- Are you talking?

30:04.106 --> 30:05.455
- Only to my lawyer.
- Yeah?

30:05.499 --> 30:07.022
- He's on standby.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.720
He's gonna be making calls,
gonna want to see his client.

30:09.764 --> 30:13.115
- Well, maybe his client
resisted arrest.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.074
Maybe his client reached
for my gun,

30:15.117 --> 30:17.250
so I had to shoot him
in the face.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.780
You are gonna tell me
what I need to know

30:25.824 --> 30:26.868
or you're gonna die.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.609
Do you understand?

30:28.652 --> 30:30.350
- Kiss my brown ass.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.309
- Sarge, take a break.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.018
- We need leverage, right?

30:46.061 --> 30:47.846
Let's use the one thing
this guy cares about.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.022
- Which is?
- The youngest son.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.894
- The honor student?
- Yeah.

30:52.938 --> 30:55.505
He's the only thing we got.

30:55.549 --> 30:56.898
- Do what you got to do.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.382
- I'm the person
who put him in lockup.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.865
But we were wrong.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.302
He didn't kill those boys;
somebody else did.

31:20.704 --> 31:25.100
- I knew in my heart that
Marcus didn't kill those kids.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.326
- Why did you do that to him?

31:33.369 --> 31:35.676
- All the evidence...

31:35.719 --> 31:37.896
said Marcus killed
two little kids,

31:37.939 --> 31:39.985
so I just treated him like...

31:41.551 --> 31:44.424
I treated him like someone
who killed two innocent boys.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.866
- When I met you
at Marcus' grave,

31:51.910 --> 31:54.042
I thought...

31:54.086 --> 31:56.827
here's a decent man.

31:58.655 --> 32:03.008
And all this time, you
were lying to me and Bobby.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.532
Lying right to our faces.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.664
- Yeah.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.189
I just wanted to help you.
I'm sorry.

32:12.452 --> 32:16.064
- You've got no right
to say that you're sorry.

32:16.108 --> 32:19.415
You've got no right
to help me or Bobby.

32:19.459 --> 32:22.331
I don't need your pity
or your money.

32:24.464 --> 32:27.336
You can't just hand out
a few hundred dollars

32:27.380 --> 32:29.643
and pretend that
this didn't happen.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.906
That you're cleansed
of your sins.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.785
Wonder what our boys here
would think

32:41.829 --> 32:44.832
if they knew you were a cop?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.486
- Angela...
- Yeah.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.619
If I tell them
who you really are,

32:49.663 --> 32:51.230
I bet they'll let me go.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.797
- No, they will kill us both.

32:53.841 --> 32:56.235
They will kill you.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.454
Angela, be smart.

32:58.498 --> 32:59.978
Be smart.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.244
- You deserve to die.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.115
- You don't.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.291
So keep your mouth shut,
for you.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.989
For Bobby.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.601
- My Bobby.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.130
- You must be thirsty.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.003
- She needs more than water.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.352
Look at how much blood
she lost.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.831
You've got to get her
to a hospital.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.833
- No one's going anywhere.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.140
- I thought the deal
was going down.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.447
- Well, it didn't go down
the way we hoped.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.058
- What does that mean?

33:39.930 --> 33:41.497
- You should know something.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.064
- Angela.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.122
- My son is really sick,

33:57.165 --> 33:59.515
and he needs help
with his medication.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.039
He's just 12.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.519
I have to be there, please.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.523
- It ain't up to me, lady.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.526
- Yo, get up here now!

34:22.756 --> 34:25.454
- He was supposed to be here
half an hour ago.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.545
Yeah.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.417
Okay.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.697
- You all right?

34:50.740 --> 34:52.916
- Yeah.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.614
- What's going on?

34:56.050 --> 34:57.834
- The lockup keepers
are taking a long time

34:57.878 --> 35:00.576
bringing up that Silva kid.
- The honor student?

35:00.620 --> 35:03.971
- Yeah, we're gonna use him as
leverage against the old man.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.929
- That's a good idea.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.456
- I've got to do something.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.768
- Hey.

35:19.639 --> 35:22.511
- We're gonna find him.
You know that, right?

35:24.296 --> 35:27.081
We're gonna find him.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.475
- Hey,
Emilio Silva just landed.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.175
- You know this isn't
exactly by the book.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.612
- Ah, books are overrated.
- No, listen.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.658
You don't have
to walk through that door.

35:38.701 --> 35:41.530
- No, I'm good.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.620
Is this how you normally roll?

35:44.664 --> 35:47.623
- This isn't a normal case.
They got my partner.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.059
Hey, Emilio.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.496
- Can I go?
- No, you can't go.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.062
We found a problem
with your car.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.630
- It was reportedly used in
an armed robbery last night.

35:54.674 --> 35:55.805
We're pressing charges.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.285
- A robbery?
But I didn't--

35:57.329 --> 35:58.547
- If I were you,
I'd keep my mouth shut.

35:58.591 --> 35:59.896
Put your hands
behind your back.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.637
- But I didn't do anything!

36:01.681 --> 36:02.986
- Yeah,
we haven't heard that before.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.640
- Can I call my dad?

36:04.684 --> 36:07.295
He told me if I ever got
in trouble, I should call him.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.428
- Yeah.
He a lawyer or something?

36:09.471 --> 36:12.170
- No, he owns
a construction company.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.825
- Hey.
Hey!

36:15.869 --> 36:17.566
Wake up!

36:18.654 --> 36:21.091
How's the eye?
- I can see fine.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.136
- Yeah?
Good.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.964
Take a look at that.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.315
- Emilio!

36:27.359 --> 36:29.578
- Dad?
What?

36:29.622 --> 36:31.232
Dad, are you okay?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.364
Dad, I didn't do anything!

36:32.407 --> 36:34.627
- Emilio, it's okay, mijo.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.325
It's okay, mijo!
It's okay!

36:37.369 --> 36:40.285
- We found a brick
of your heroin in his car.

36:40.328 --> 36:41.851
- Let Emilio go.
He's a good boy.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.026
He's not part of this.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.811
- Is my man alive?
- I don't know.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.682
- You don't know?
Is he?

36:46.726 --> 36:48.423
- I told them
to wait for my call,

36:48.467 --> 36:50.469
to wait until my product
was returned.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.081
- Give me something.

36:54.124 --> 36:56.214
- He's at 3900 West Union.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.217
It's an old
manufacturing plant.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.436
You son of a bitch!

37:01.480 --> 37:03.090
- Nice work.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.707
Kick one of those pipes
over to me.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.622
Do it.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.885
Angela.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.061
Angela.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.541
Angela, kick me
one of those pipes.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.021
Angela, come on.

37:21.064 --> 37:22.979
We've got to work together
if we want to get out of here.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.372
You've got to kick one over.
Come on.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.636
Please, it's the only way.
Come on.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.726
- The front
has surveillance cameras.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.946
So, Kim, you and Rojas
hold the perimeter.

37:32.989 --> 37:36.819
Kev, you and Hailey take
the south side of the building.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.308
- Damn near like Fort Knox.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.267
There's no windows or doors.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.226
- They got in,
we're getting in.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.272
Sarge, no entry point
on the south side.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.622
- Just keep looking.

38:01.322 --> 38:02.802
- Damn.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.722
- All right, there you go.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.640
- Can I have some water?

38:15.815 --> 38:17.251
Please, man.

38:28.218 --> 38:31.178
- Look at that.
- That could be a way in.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.093
- Not for me,
but I can help you up.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.312
Ready?
- Yeah.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.314
- Okay.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.496
- Upton's inside, Sarge.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.845
- Alone?

38:45.888 --> 38:47.977
- We had to, Sarge.
It's the only way.

38:59.380 --> 39:02.818
- All right.
You did good, okay?

39:02.862 --> 39:05.125
You did real good.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.567
- All right, Hailey,
you got your ears on?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.134
Hailey.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.399
All right, we got entry
on the west side.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.010
We are moving in.
Do you copy, Hailey?

39:21.054 --> 39:24.144
- I think she shut down, Sarge.
On my way.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.497
- Okay.
All right.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.325
Stay here.
Stay here.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.415
Take this.
I'm going after the other one.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.417
Okay?

39:39.899 --> 39:42.771
- I still haven't
even heard from him!

39:44.338 --> 39:46.384
Listen,
something ain't right.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.298
Stop talking!
Just...

39:48.342 --> 39:50.518
you call me the second
you hear anything.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.694
Exactly, I tried
to call him three times.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.305
He still hasn't hit me back.
I don't care what you gotta do.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.395
You hit the streets.
You understand me?

39:57.438 --> 39:58.918
You hit the First,
you hit the Fifth.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.746
I don't care...

40:15.369 --> 40:16.849
- Jay!

40:16.892 --> 40:18.241
Jay, are you okay?

40:18.285 --> 40:20.461
Jay!

40:20.505 --> 40:23.682
Hey, are you okay?

40:28.817 --> 40:31.733
I've got to go help Angela.
She's downstairs.

40:36.303 --> 40:38.479
Stay there.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.612
- 5021 Henry,
we've got an offender down

40:40.655 --> 40:42.048
and an officer injured.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.442
Roll two ambulances to 3900...

40:44.485 --> 40:47.227
- Angela.
Angela, it's okay.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.274
You're safe.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.496
It's over.
