WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
(upbeat music playing)

00:02.160 --> 00:03.840
(Rayanne)
Go now! Go!

00:04.760 --> 00:07.240
Um... excuse me.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.840
Could you spare some change
for a phone call?

00:09.920 --> 00:11.760
It's an emergency.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.840
See, okay, see,
this guy, like...

00:13.920 --> 00:15.280
Robbed our bus.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.560
Tickets and, um, you know,
my sister and I, we're twins.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.120
We're not the kind of twins
who look alike.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.640
We just finish each other's
sentences.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.520
Oh. That's cool.
How do you do that?

00:26.760 --> 00:30.360
Um, hi. Could you spare
some change? (laughs)

00:31.040 --> 00:33.760
She's... she's... upset.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.520
See, you look a little like
our mother, who's in a coma.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.040
(cries)

00:43.320 --> 00:46.680
Excuse her. She's hypoglycemic.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.880
I'd better...
get her some chocolate!

00:49.960 --> 00:53.320
(Angela) <i>So I started hanging out</i>
<i>with Rayanne Graff.</i>

00:53.400 --> 00:55.120
<i>Just... for fun,</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:59.200
<i>just 'cause it seemed like if I didn't,</i>
<i>I would die or something.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:03.520
<i>Things were getting to me</i>
<i>just how people are.</i>

01:03.600 --> 01:08.000
<i>How they always expect you to be</i>
<i>a certain way... even your best friend.</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:09.920
(indistinct chatter)

01:14.960 --> 01:18.560
So then she admits she only joined
yearbook to be near Scott,

01:18.640 --> 01:20.760
which is, like, so low.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.920
I mean, It's just, I know,
if she doesn't want to be in yearbook,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.520
then she should, like, quit.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.880
(upbeat music playing)

01:29.480 --> 01:32.280
(Angela) <i>Like, with boys,</i>
<i>how they have it so easy.</i>

01:33.720 --> 01:35.280
<i>How you have to pretend...</i>

01:36.520 --> 01:37.960
<i>you don't notice them...</i>

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
<i>noticing you.</i>

01:54.880 --> 01:56.360
<i>Like cheerleaders.</i>

01:57.480 --> 02:00.040
<i>Can't people just cheer</i>
<i>on their own?</i>

02:00.520 --> 02:03.200
<i>Like... to themselves?</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:06.640
So typical of the way she is.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.280
She always does stuff like that.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.040
It's not, like, too embarrassing
for me to know this. You know?

02:24.640 --> 02:27.240
-Who are you looking for?
-Nobody.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.560
(Angela)
<i>School is a battlefield...</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:31.680
<i>for your heart.</i>

02:33.600 --> 02:38.920
<i>So when Rayanne Graff told me my hair</i>
<i>was holding me back, I had to listen.</i>

02:40.720 --> 02:42.960
<i>'Cause she wasn't just talking</i>
<i>about my hair.</i>

02:44.440 --> 02:47.040
<i>She was talking about my life.</i>

02:53.760 --> 02:54.840
So it is you.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.880
I had my hair dyed.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.320
Oh, you had it dyed.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.920
I thought it had died
of natural causes.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
Angela, come on! I'm starv...

03:08.640 --> 03:09.680
starving.

03:10.880 --> 03:11.920
You're Angela's mom?

03:12.920 --> 03:15.440
Yes, I am. That's true.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.440
-I like your house.
-Thank you.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.760
-Who are you?
-Um, this is Rayanne and Ricky.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.160
You dyed your hair.
Okay.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.120
Uh, well, here is some...
cheese.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.480
And there are drinks in the,
um...

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
Fridge?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.760
Uh, thank you. So...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.400
(clicks tongue)
Okay, I'm leaving now.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.080
Well, not the house, the...

03:44.160 --> 03:45.680
(scoffs)
room.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.080
-She's nice.
-Not really.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.520
-She took your hair real calm.
-That's 'cause you two are here.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.720
Good cheese.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.880
(exhales)

04:02.680 --> 04:05.960
(Angela) <i>I cannot bring myself to eat a</i>
<i>well-balanced meal in front of my mother.</i>

04:06.880 --> 04:08.600
<i>It just means too much to her.</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:14.680
<i>I mean, if you stop to think about,</i>
<i>like... chewing, what it really is...</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:18.320
<i>how people just do it...</i>
<i>like, in public.</i>

04:18.920 --> 04:20.240
Wait. Don't tell me.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.160
There's something different.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.680
I would never have died
my hair red.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.000
It's not red.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.880
-It's crimson glow.
-Ohh...

04:30.200 --> 04:34.480
well, I can see it now...
social whirl, wild parties...

04:35.160 --> 04:36.320
Axl Rose.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.400
(Angela) <i>My dad thinks every person</i>
<i>in the world is having more fun than him,</i>

04:39.480 --> 04:41.120
<i>which could be true.</i>

04:41.200 --> 04:42.720
What am I supposed to say?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.160
-Nothing.
-It's her hair.

04:44.240 --> 04:49.600
Exactly... and... we'll always
be able to spot you...

04:50.440 --> 04:51.280
in a crowd.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.280
(Angela) <i>Lately,</i>
<i>I can't even look at my mother</i>

04:53.360 --> 04:55.880
<i>without wanting to stab her...</i>
<i>repeatedly.</i>

05:00.480 --> 05:01.600
Hey!

05:03.080 --> 05:05.240
Who left all those lights on
down there?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.720
Oh... I just, uh, oop, okay.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.960
Danielle's still afraid of the dark.
She leaves the lights on.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.160
-I don't leave the lights on.
-Well, good. Okay.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.920
-I just...
-(Danielle) I don't leave the lights on.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.880
Okay!

05:20.960 --> 05:22.760
(Danielle)
And I'm not afraid of the dark.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.920
(Angela) <i>My dad and I</i>
<i>used to be pretty tight.</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:28.560
Um... how's school?

05:29.160 --> 05:31.720
Um, I'm starting
to like Anne Frank.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.640
Huh?
Is she a sophomore, too?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
-No. She's dead.
-Oh, right.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.920
Anne Frank, Dad!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.920
Oh, right! Right!
Um, I meant... I mean...

05:43.600 --> 05:46.880
Okay, Um...
don't stay up too late.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.480
(Angela) <i>The sad truth is...</i>
<i>my breasts have come between us.</i>

05:51.560 --> 05:52.600
(scoffs)

05:54.920 --> 05:58.600
Tell her not to walk around
in a towel, okay?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.960
-You can tell her.
-No, I can't.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.320
If I could tell her, I would tell her.
You tell her.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.000
Or get her a bigger towel.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.640
God, Chelsea Clinton.
Will you look at this?

06:11.720 --> 06:16.200
No freedom, no privacy,
constant surveillance...

06:16.960 --> 06:18.920
secret service men...

06:21.800 --> 06:23.120
-that's what we need.
-(chuckles)

06:23.200 --> 06:24.920
(crickets chirping)

06:28.880 --> 06:29.880
Patty...

06:31.920 --> 06:33.280
it could be a lot worse.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.600
I know.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.240
(kisses)

06:40.560 --> 06:43.760
I mean, she could be
cutting class, doing drugs...

06:46.360 --> 06:47.680
having sex...

06:48.280 --> 06:49.200
like we did.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.680
I never cut class...

06:52.520 --> 06:54.440
and you never had sex
in high school.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.760
You know,
I know why she did it.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.240
She did it to get me to react.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.080
-Maybe she did it...
-She did it to get a reaction.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.440
-Then don't react!
-I'm not.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.680
I won't.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
It's just...

07:17.520 --> 07:20.960
so hard to look at her.
She looks like a stranger.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.000
(dramatic music playing)

07:28.680 --> 07:29.720
(Angela)
<i>I'm in love.</i>

07:30.600 --> 07:32.920
<i>His name is Jordan Catalano.</i>

07:33.000 --> 07:35.320
<i>He was left back...</i>
<i>twice.</i>

07:37.480 --> 07:40.760
<i>Once I almost touched his shoulder</i>
<i>in the middle of a pop quiz.</i>

07:42.080 --> 07:45.280
<i>He's always...</i>
<i>closing his eyes.</i>

07:46.640 --> 07:48.640
<i>Like it hurts to look at things.</i>

07:48.720 --> 07:50.880
(indistinct chatter)

08:00.320 --> 08:01.560
(locker door closes)

08:19.640 --> 08:21.600
-Angela, get in here a sec.
-(door opens)

08:28.320 --> 08:29.440
Do you want to
have sex with him?

08:29.520 --> 08:31.320
-Who?
-Who?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.280
Jordan!

08:33.360 --> 08:34.520
Catalano?

08:35.560 --> 08:38.080
God! I'm not going
to tell anyone. Just admit it.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.000
I just like how he's always leaning...
against stuff.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.880
He leans great.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.560
Well, either sex or
a conversation... ideally both.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.920
Well, you have to come
to Tino's tomorrow night.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.200
-Angela, Jordan Cata...
-Shh!

08:57.920 --> 08:59.960
Jordan Catalano's
gonna be there.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.120
Shh!

09:03.840 --> 09:06.480
(Angela) <i>Rayanne always knows</i>
<i>who's going to be there.</i>

09:06.560 --> 09:08.520
(door opens)

09:08.600 --> 09:10.080
(dramatic music playing)

09:15.560 --> 09:18.200
I can't believe you did that
to your hair...

09:18.960 --> 09:20.160
without telling me!

09:20.240 --> 09:21.640
(bell rings)

09:22.840 --> 09:24.040
(indistinct chatter)

09:24.120 --> 09:28.000
(teacher) Take your seats please!
Come on! Come on! Please just...

09:28.640 --> 09:30.720
look, people, if we can't
get through this,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.360
the yearbook
won't have a theme.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.880
I don't really care.
It's your yearbook, not mine.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.320
Now, I'm going to read the themes.
Raise your hands to vote.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.880
We have graduation,
final frie...

09:39.960 --> 09:42.440
(Angela) <i>My parents keep asking</i>
<i>how school was.</i>

09:42.520 --> 09:46.200
<i>That's like saying...</i>
<i>how was that drive-by shooting?</i>

09:47.000 --> 09:48.720
<i>You don't care how it was.</i>

09:48.800 --> 09:50.880
<i>You're lucky to get out alive.</i>

09:50.960 --> 09:55.200
Apple, fruit of knowledge...
year 2000.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.680
Who didn't vote?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
Me.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.920
Where are you going?

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
I don't want to be on yearbook.
Sorry.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.040
You mind telling us why not?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
No.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.120
I mean, yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.760
I mean, I don't know why.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.120
(camera shutter clicks)

10:29.200 --> 10:32.040
-(Patty) Angela, Sharon is here!
-Don't they feed you?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.000
(Danielle) There's something
wrong with my waffle.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.400
-Sharon, no, don't eat the crust, homey
-I was eating that!

10:39.480 --> 10:41.360
It's got, like,
these little bumps on it.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.200
I left my Anne<i> Frank</i> here.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.560
If I find money, can I keep it?

10:47.360 --> 10:50.280
Oh, this room is a disaster!

10:50.360 --> 10:52.280
You could have told me
you were quitting.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.200
What? What are you quitting?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
We're going to be late.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.520
I thought you liked yearbook.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.880
(Danielle)
I found it!

11:01.440 --> 11:02.800
(exhales)

11:04.200 --> 11:05.960
Well, don't thank me
or anything.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.480
-Get out of my room!
-(mouthing)

11:10.120 --> 11:12.680
And when were you planning on telling me?
(scoffs)

11:13.280 --> 11:16.240
Listen to me.
"I thought you liked yearbook."

11:16.320 --> 11:20.560
Your room is a disaster. Do you think
I ever dreamed I would sound like this?

11:21.520 --> 11:22.720
Angela!

11:23.440 --> 11:25.400
I am not cleaning this up!

11:27.560 --> 11:29.240
(birds chirping)

11:29.320 --> 11:31.600
(bell rings)

11:34.240 --> 11:38.520
So, Ricky, Angela's in love with
Jordan Catalano. We have to help her.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.960
-Rayanne!
-Come on! I can tell Ricky.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.480
You got to come to Tino's
tonight. He'll be there.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.920
He doesn't even know me!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.400
Am I making a fool of myself?

11:48.480 --> 11:49.920
I don't know.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Ricky,
give us the male perspective.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.640
Don't you love how he leans?

11:53.720 --> 11:56.960
I don't get obsessed with them,
so I don't have these problems.

11:57.040 --> 11:57.920
(bell rings)

11:58.000 --> 11:59.920
Oh, God! Second bell.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.440
I may as well go to bio...
since I'm not all that busy.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.760
(door opens)

12:09.840 --> 12:11.440
(dramatic music playing)

12:18.760 --> 12:20.240
(sniffs)

12:22.160 --> 12:25.680
And what is the purpose
of plasma?

12:27.240 --> 12:29.720
The purpose of plasma
is to...

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
what?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.680
Why do we need plasma?

12:36.880 --> 12:39.960
-Brian?
-Because the league of nations failed.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.240
And why did
the league of nations fail?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.960
-Brian?
-'Cause it's written in the first person?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.400
Exactly. Thank you.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.040
Does she say 'she' was forced
to go into hiding?

12:57.520 --> 12:59.400
Somebody else besides Brian.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.440
Brian?

13:03.320 --> 13:04.600
-No.
-No.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.160
She says 'I'.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.480
"I was forced
to go into hiding."

13:08.560 --> 13:09.920
(light creaking)

13:10.000 --> 13:12.800
It's called the first person,
okay?

13:12.880 --> 13:14.320
This will be on the quiz.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.720
So how would you
describe Anne Frank?

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
Lucky.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.160
Is that supposed to be funny,
Angela?

13:29.640 --> 13:32.880
How on earth could you make
a statement like that, hmm?

13:35.120 --> 13:39.360
(door opens and closes)

13:44.080 --> 13:46.600
Anne Frank perished
in a concentration camp.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.920
Anne Frank is a tragic figure.
How could Anne Frank be lucky?

13:51.800 --> 13:52.880
I don't know.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.480
Because she was... trapped
in an attic for three years

13:57.560 --> 13:58.960
with this guy she really liked?

14:06.920 --> 14:08.040
(exhales)

14:09.200 --> 14:10.800
(bell rings)

14:12.360 --> 14:15.160
Excuse my eating,
but with all these cutbacks,

14:15.240 --> 14:17.760
I don't really get a lunch break
on Thursdays.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.320
Sit down, Angela.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.560
(Angela) <i>Seeing a teacher's</i>
<i>actual lunch... is, like, so depressing.</i>

14:31.280 --> 14:33.280
<i>Not to mention her bra strap.</i>

14:33.360 --> 14:34.840
So...

14:36.480 --> 14:37.680
you quit yearbook, hmm?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.680
No explanation?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.000
Your appearance has altered.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.040
I'm really concerned
you're getting off on the wrong foot.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.320
Is there a problem at home?
(chewing)

14:56.960 --> 14:58.000
It just seems like...

14:59.600 --> 15:03.240
you agree to have a certain
personality or something...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.120
for no reason.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.240
Just to make things
easier for everyone.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.120
But when you think about it... I mean,
how do you know if It's even you?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.040
(indistinct chatter)

15:22.320 --> 15:24.800
And, I mean, this whole thing
with yearbook, It's like...

15:25.360 --> 15:27.960
everybody's in this big hurry
to make this book...

15:28.920 --> 15:31.360
to supposedly remember
what happened, but it's...

15:32.360 --> 15:33.840
it's not even
what really happened.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.120
It's what everybody thinks
was supposed to happen.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.760
Because if you made a book
of what really happened...

15:42.840 --> 15:44.840
it'd be a really upsetting book.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.280
You know,
in my humble opinion.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.560
(dramatic music playing)

16:08.600 --> 16:10.240
(Angela)
<i>My dad sells printing.</i>

16:10.840 --> 16:12.800
<i>It was in my mom's family.</i>

16:12.880 --> 16:15.880
<i>My dad was just supposed</i>
<i>to do it for a while.</i>

16:15.960 --> 16:19.000
<i>Then he was supposed to go</i>
<i>to chef's school, but he never did.</i>

16:19.080 --> 16:20.560
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

16:23.120 --> 16:26.400
You should see what they
call chili con carne at school.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.240
First of all, It's just beans.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.040
-Well, It's not chili con carne.
-I know.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.960
-Con carne... with meat.
-I know.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.280
I think the lack of meat
is destroying America.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.920
(Angela)
<i>My mom took over the business.</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:43.560
<i>She's kind of my dad's boss now...</i>
<i>which I guess he tries not to think about.</i>

16:46.760 --> 16:48.000
Mom won't be home till late.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.440
You know...

16:51.320 --> 16:54.880
I think you give her too hard a time...
sometimes.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.520
She just wants you
to be happy.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.160
She wants everyone
to be happy.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.240
No. That's you.

17:04.840 --> 17:05.840
My point...

17:06.840 --> 17:07.880
I mean...

17:08.800 --> 17:12.480
think of all of the things
that she does... for you.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.240
Out of nowhere,
she'll get in this mood...

17:20.520 --> 17:22.280
and her lips will get all tight.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.960
It's just so obvious that's she's looking
for someone to blame.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.080
Yeah.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.440
But you know
that's not the real her.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
Just try to be nicer to her.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.440
Once in a while.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.960
-As an experiment.
-(smiles)

17:44.760 --> 17:46.240
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.560
Dad, there's this thing tonight?

17:56.760 --> 17:58.440
At a friend of Rayanne's house?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.840
Like, this... rehearsal?

18:04.400 --> 18:08.840
Um, for this play that we might
all do as... extra credit.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.800
And I know mom says no going out
on school nights,

18:11.880 --> 18:15.640
but this is, like, part of school...
and I won't be home late,

18:15.720 --> 18:18.000
and I...
just really want to go.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.560
(rock music playing)

This doesn't seem like a Friday.

It's Thursday.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.280
Oh.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.480
Are you sure?

21:17.080 --> 21:20.200
Well, yesterday
was Wednesday, so...

21:22.600 --> 21:25.200
Oh... right.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.920
So that's how I know.
(chuckles)

21:33.840 --> 21:35.440
(door opens)

21:35.520 --> 21:38.040
Jordan, this bites.
Let's go over to Grundy's. Come on.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.880
(door closes)

21:49.240 --> 21:50.760
(sighs)

21:50.840 --> 21:52.240
-The point is...
-I know what it is...

21:52.320 --> 21:54.640
No. The point is... ugh!

21:54.720 --> 21:56.920
I can't believe we're having
this conversation.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.200
I can't believe it.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.880
We need a new conversation.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.200
I shouldn't have allowed her...

22:01.280 --> 22:03.600
Why do I always have
to be the mean one?

22:03.680 --> 22:06.040
Why can't you be the mean one
every once in a while?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.760
-I can be!
-But you never are! Look, I...

22:09.440 --> 22:10.800
(sighs)

22:10.880 --> 22:13.560
I'm calm, okay?
But you can't keep letting...

22:14.280 --> 22:16.360
(scoffs) I mean, you know
she loves you more...

22:16.440 --> 22:19.400
-She doesn't love me more!
-She does! Come on!

22:19.480 --> 22:23.720
She loves you more. I accept that, but
that's not enough for you. You have to...

22:25.080 --> 22:26.560
(exhales)

22:26.640 --> 22:27.760
I don't want to fight.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.600
Actually, I'm not...
even that upset.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.960
(door opens)

22:35.560 --> 22:37.880
Where the hell have you been?

22:37.960 --> 22:39.760
-Oh, my God! What happened to you?
-Patty...

22:39.840 --> 22:42.080
-Are you alright...
-Didn't you explain it to her?

22:43.640 --> 22:47.000
-Excuse me. You explain to her...
-This isn't her fault.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.440
Of course, it is.
She snowed you.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.360
-I told you she...
-Shut up!

22:52.440 --> 22:54.560
-What did I do?
-I'm sorry, sweetheart.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.560
We'll just find out what happened.
Could we just find...

22:57.640 --> 23:00.240
How do you expect her
to have respect for me?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.480
I respect you. God!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.160
Nothing happened.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.520
I fell in some mud.
I'm all right.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.120
(exhales)

23:16.200 --> 23:18.680
(dramatic music playing)

23:20.360 --> 23:23.120
I think we should all...
go to bed.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.200
(lamp light turns off)

23:44.840 --> 23:46.080
What really happened?

23:53.520 --> 23:55.520
(indistinct chatter)

24:01.480 --> 24:04.720
So there's this rave tonight,
okay, at that club Let's Bolt.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.160
Tino can get us in.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.240
Guaranteed...
Jordan Catalano will be there.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.000
-Rayanne.
-What? It's perfect.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.720
You don't have
to think of anything to say to him

24:12.800 --> 24:14.800
because no one can hear anybody.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.920
I think, Lard's my favorite food group.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.760
(indistinct chatter)

24:23.520 --> 24:27.120
(Angela) <i>The cafeteria is</i>
<i>the embarrassment capital of the world.</i>

24:27.200 --> 24:28.720
<i>It's like a prison movie.</i>

24:33.720 --> 24:35.440
So where do you want to sit?

24:35.520 --> 24:38.320
I don't have anything to wear
to a place like that.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.120
I'll lend you something.
I have to look tough.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.640
Somebody once set fire
to my hair at Let's Bolt.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.960
Wait. So, what's fat-free?

24:47.040 --> 24:50.320
When something's,
like, free of fat.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.120
What's the difference between
fat-free and, like, nonfat?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.280
Good question.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.080
I'd have to think of a lie.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.840
Simple. You're staying
over at my place

25:01.920 --> 25:03.600
and It's a perfect lie,
because...

25:05.360 --> 25:07.480
you can stay over.
My mom won't even be there.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.960
Well, I got to go find Tino.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.880
Think about it.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.880
Um...
is there any soap in there?

25:25.960 --> 25:27.000
There's never soap.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.240
Hi.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.240
(scoffs and chuckles)

25:43.760 --> 25:44.960
Um... so I...

25:46.200 --> 25:48.240
I think you should know
what people are saying about you.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.040
What?

25:51.080 --> 25:56.520
(inhales) That you think you're so above
everyone and that, um...

25:56.600 --> 25:59.960
and that Rayanne Graff
is like God to you now

26:00.040 --> 26:01.960
and you do whatever she says.

26:02.040 --> 26:06.000
By the way, she's just using you...
like she did with Jodie Barsh.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.560
I just thought
you should know.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.000
What did she do to Jodie Barsh?

26:11.640 --> 26:14.640
(laughs) Oh, please.
It's, like, so known.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.840
So, um... so tell me what I did, Angela.
I mean, I would really like to know.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.960
Nothing.
It's not something that you...

26:27.040 --> 26:29.080
So you just drop your
oldest friend for no reason?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.880
I mean... I mean, just tell me what I did.
(sobs)

26:35.280 --> 26:36.280
I can't.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.880
It's not like one thing.
It's not like that.

26:39.960 --> 26:44.120
Okay, great. So just never speak
to me again. (crying)

26:44.200 --> 26:45.400
Real mature, Angela.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.760
No, I want to speak to you.
I never want...

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
No, forget it!

26:59.960 --> 27:01.360
(scoffs and sniffs)

27:01.440 --> 27:04.520
God.
Your hair.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.080
Did Patty, like, hemorrhage
the first time she saw it?

27:13.680 --> 27:14.720
In a sense.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.080
All I have to say...

27:19.800 --> 27:20.680
I hate it.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.520
(slow music playing)

27:26.440 --> 27:32.040
(door opens and closes)

27:33.560 --> 27:35.280
Hey! You know what I think?

27:35.360 --> 27:39.240
I think that we should
all go ice skating.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.840
I mean it.
(chuckles)

27:40.920 --> 27:45.080
All of us... ice skating,
hot chocolate, sprained ankles.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.400
I'm in the mood.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.800
There's this movie on tonight
I really want to watch.

27:49.880 --> 27:54.320
It's about this girl who does
obscene phone calls. It's, like, her job.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.760
Really?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
I told Neil that I would
shoot pool with him tonight.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.280
(scoffs) You're seeing your brother
twice in one week?

28:02.360 --> 28:04.760
He broke up with her again.
I feel sorry for him.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.480
And then somebody tries
to kill her over the phone.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.200
Well, I guess It's just
us girls tonight, which...

28:11.280 --> 28:14.440
I'm grounded just
because of last night?

28:14.520 --> 28:16.520
I never said you were grounded.
What I said...

28:16.600 --> 28:19.920
So, mom,
I'm allowed to, right?

28:20.000 --> 28:23.960
'Cause Rayanne invited me
to sleep over her house tonight.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.520
I am allowed to watch that,
right?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.080
That girl from the other day?

28:28.160 --> 28:30.320
-That rude girl.
-She wasn't rude.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.120
She finished my cheese.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.240
I had this brand-new brick
of cheese. She devoured it.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.520
-Dad
-I am allowed to, right?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.840
-You know, I have met this
Rayanne exactly once.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.880
I do not know,
I do not know her parents.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.440
What, you never spent a night
at a friend's house?

28:43.520 --> 28:45.640
My parents knew my friends.

28:45.720 --> 28:46.560
Mom, right?

28:46.640 --> 28:49.680
-Yes, you may watch the movie.
-Mom, you offered her cheese.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.160
They knew all 900
of your friends personally.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.800
Okay,
we've all heard this before.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.000
(Angela) <i>My parents went to</i>
<i>the same high school</i>

28:58.080 --> 29:00.920
<i>but they never knew</i>
<i>each other... then.</i>

29:01.640 --> 29:04.280
They had to change the prom date

29:04.360 --> 29:05.840
because she was getting
her appendix out.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.160
I never asked them
to change the date.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.200
Meanwhile, I couldn't get
a girl to look at me.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.280
You don't even have to drive me,
because Ricky's cousin said he would.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.360
Oh, Ricky's cousin!

29:21.440 --> 29:23.720
Well, why didn't you say so?
That eases my mind.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.960
-Angela.
-Patty.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.040
-Patty.
-We haven't met this Ricky.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.600
-Stop calling him this Ricky.
-I did parallel bars today.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.640
Mrs. Sitte said
my dismount was perfect.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.920
I find Ricky a little confusing.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.200
Okay, so maybe he's bi.
Who cares?

29:46.280 --> 29:50.080
-His cousin can still drive.
-What? He is what?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.840
Do you hear these terms
she's throwing around? Bi?

29:52.920 --> 29:54.800
-It means bisexual.
-He's bisexual?

29:54.880 --> 29:59.080
How can he be bi anything? He's a child.
He's obviously very confused.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.800
-He's not confused.
-He wears eyeliner.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.360
He does?
He wears eyeliner?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.240
-I thought you were on my side.
-I'm not on any side.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.760
-Gram, grow up. Choose a side.
-Is this girl's mother going to be there?

30:10.360 --> 30:14.160
No. Rayanne lives by her wits
in an alley.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.760
Yes, obviously!

30:15.840 --> 30:18.760
She's her mother.
They live in the same place.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.880
Obviously her mother's
going to be there.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.520
Dad. Do you want
to see my headstand?

30:23.600 --> 30:24.400
(clicks tongue)

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
Fine. Go.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.600
Spend the night at some total
stranger's house. I don't care.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.640
-Yeah, like you really mean it.
-No, go.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.040
And you, go shoot pool
with your brother

30:34.120 --> 30:35.480
or wherever the hell
you're going.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.640
So you'll have it as a grudge
and never forgive me.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.040
-Dad, are you looking?
-Ahh!

30:42.680 --> 30:44.480
(door opens and closes)

30:44.560 --> 30:45.760
Dad, are you looking?

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
(crickets chirping)

30:58.200 --> 30:59.960
(dramatic music playing)

31:15.080 --> 31:16.280
Hey, Chase.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.560
Get out of here, Crakow.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Um... you're breaking,
like, 14 different laws.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.240
-You looked better before.
-Like, I'm devastated.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.360
Like, I am.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.960
Oh, look at me. I'm way cool.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.760
I'm off with my way cool friends
to sniff floor wax.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.160
That's right. Cover that zit.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.920
-Want me to do yours?
-Oh, that hurt!

31:46.520 --> 31:47.960
Who are you waiting for,
Catalano?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.680
Maybe you're not
going anywhere.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.400
-Maybe you're just a whaddayacallit...
-I'm going to Let's Bolt.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.680
Exhibitionist.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.320
Like they're really going
to get you into Let's Bolt.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.520
(crickets chirping)

32:02.240 --> 32:03.440
Aw, quit it!

32:03.520 --> 32:06.240
You're not stupid. Don't act like it.
It's a stupid act.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.320
Everybody's an act...
including you.

32:15.720 --> 32:18.600
-(door opens)
-So have a really amazing night, okay?

32:18.680 --> 32:21.320
I'm going to throw up now.
Have a wonderful time.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.400
-Ha. My clueless neighbor.
-You look so tough.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.200
This is going to be
one amazing night.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.000
Where is Tino?

32:41.040 --> 32:44.200
He'll be here, okay? Haven't
you ever waited for anything?

32:44.280 --> 32:45.920
Yeah. For my life to start.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.680
I mean, Tino's coming.
It's way early.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.200
Come on, nobody's here yet!

32:59.640 --> 33:01.120
Look how thin you are.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.320
Tino, where are you?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.040
But yours are really little.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.120
But they're fat.
They're, like, fatter.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.200
Ricky, who has cuter feet?

33:12.280 --> 33:14.080
Me.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.400
Let's trade shoes.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.080
(indistinct chatter)

33:18.160 --> 33:21.200
(both laugh)

33:24.120 --> 33:26.240
If you're about to do it, okay,

33:26.320 --> 33:29.280
what would you want the other
person to say, like right before?

33:29.360 --> 33:30.840
-This won't take long.
-(scoffs)

33:30.920 --> 33:33.080
No. Seriously.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.240
-Don't I know you?
-No. For real. Like... like romantic.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.080
You're so beautiful...

33:43.520 --> 33:45.400
it hurts to look at you.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.440
It hurts to look at you?

33:50.280 --> 33:54.480
-How'd you think of that?
-Well... where would it hurts? (laughs)

33:54.560 --> 33:55.960
I really like that.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.400
Well, I'm going to tell Jordan.
(laughs)

33:59.480 --> 34:01.920
-Rayanne!
-Jordan!

34:03.320 --> 34:05.400
Jordan! Oh, my God.
Tell Jordan.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.760
Jordan! Jordan!

34:07.840 --> 34:09.640
Jordan. Oh!

34:11.120 --> 34:13.080
Hi. Uh...

34:14.240 --> 34:15.520
could you get us in?

34:16.120 --> 34:19.320
Our friend's in there. He's got my keys.
It's an emergency.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.760
(scoffs) So what,
they wouldn't let you in?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.000
How old are you guys?

34:25.080 --> 34:27.360
(all laughs)

34:31.400 --> 34:34.560
-Do you guys want to go somewhere?
-Do you?

34:34.640 --> 34:35.520
I don't know.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.600
If they're really young,
isn't that kidnapping?

34:37.680 --> 34:39.240
-No.
-Don't you?

34:39.320 --> 34:42.200
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. No. Not three.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.720
Just you and you.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.320
Well, I'm not
leaving Ricky here.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400
-Ricky don't mind.
-I don't mind.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.760
You.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.640
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.320
Well, ask me from there.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.440
I want to ask you over here.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.680
-Come on. Too young.
-Relax.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.280
I don't take orders...
and I'm not stupid.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.800
But you came when I called,
didn't you?

35:19.120 --> 35:20.520
(grunts)

35:21.440 --> 35:25.720
(Angela) <i>Something was actually</i>
<i>happening... but it was too actual.</i>

35:27.360 --> 35:29.160
-So where we going?
-Come on. That's enough.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.640
Come on! Wait...

35:33.200 --> 35:34.920
Let go of her!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.160
-(thuds)
-What's your problem?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.480
-Come on, man. Let's go!
-What!

35:40.600 --> 35:43.160
Hey, I take care
of myself, okay?

35:43.240 --> 35:44.760
(bottle burst)

35:44.840 --> 35:47.520
-Oh, man, you're dead!
-No. Forget it!

35:47.600 --> 35:48.640
Forget it!

35:49.640 --> 35:51.200
Come on, forget it!

35:52.280 --> 35:53.720
She won't remember
this tomorrow.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.480
She blacks out when she drinks.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.520
Hey! Let's just go.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.960
-I got to go.
-(kisses)

36:01.920 --> 36:03.280
Do you know these girls?

36:10.840 --> 36:13.520
<i>-♪ Mr. Police-man ♪</i>
-Uh-huh.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.080
Oh, perfect!
'Cause we need a ride.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.280
Relax. I'm not arresting you.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.520
Could you do the siren?

36:22.600 --> 36:24.400
-Watch your head.
-Please? Please?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.800
-Oh, my God, Angela!
-Oh, my God!

36:29.480 --> 36:32.480
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-(indistinct chatter on PA)

36:33.960 --> 36:35.400
Hey, I know that girl.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.800
Oh, my God!

36:39.240 --> 36:40.640
Angela?

36:40.720 --> 36:42.400
-(laughs)
-(door closes)

36:42.480 --> 36:44.120
(dramatic music playing)

36:58.080 --> 37:00.760
(door opens and closes)

37:00.840 --> 37:03.080
I knew what I was doing
back there, you know.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.760
Okay.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.880
I'll always...

37:09.080 --> 37:10.240
watch out for you.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.720
Okay, I'll always be there
for you, so...

37:16.760 --> 37:18.200
don't worry, okay?

37:18.800 --> 37:19.760
I won't.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.480
(door opens)

37:23.960 --> 37:27.640
And, you know...
with your hair like that...

37:29.240 --> 37:30.720
it hurts to look at you.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.720
Come on.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.360
(door closes)

37:46.440 --> 37:49.680
(Angela) <i>At Rayanne's house...</i>
<i>no one was home.</i>

38:05.320 --> 38:07.520
Well...
I never read the book.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.000
Oh, the book is really...

38:09.600 --> 38:12.680
see,
it's this diary of her life.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.000
See, these Nazis
were going to kill her,

38:16.080 --> 38:18.960
so... whatever she'd
been like with her friends

38:19.040 --> 38:21.520
or her teachers,
that was just over.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.440
She was hiding.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.440
But... in this other way,
she wasn't.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.560
She, like, stopped hiding.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.040
She was free.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.440
Don't do this again.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.520
You got that?

38:45.520 --> 38:47.240
Could you please not come
to my door?

38:52.280 --> 38:54.760
(door opens and closes)

38:59.800 --> 39:04.720
(door opens and closes)

39:04.800 --> 39:05.880
Hey, you.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.880
You a friend of hers?

39:10.120 --> 39:11.960
-Yeah.
-Then act like it.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.200
Watch out for her.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.000

(door opens and closes)

39:31.160 --> 39:32.360
(car engine starts)

39:32.440 --> 39:34.800
So...
what happened?

39:45.720 --> 39:48.160
Right. Like you aren't going to
tell me what happened. Chase.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.080
These guys started
hitting on us.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.680
What, like... sexual harassment?

39:58.280 --> 39:59.480
Like guys.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.600
So they picked a theme

40:09.760 --> 40:12.640

-Nobody.

Hi.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.560
What happened
to spending the night?

43:00.600 --> 43:03.000
Well, did you
at least have fun?

43:04.680 --> 43:05.680
Sort of.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.680
How'd you get home?

43:12.040 --> 43:13.320
Rayanne's mom.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.560
(Angela)
<i>My mother's adopted.</i>

43:19.160 --> 43:22.040
<i>For a while, she was looking</i>
<i>for her real parents.</i>

43:25.040 --> 43:27.280
<i>I guess that's what</i>
<i>everyone's looking for.</i>

43:33.440 --> 43:34.880
I'm really sorry...
(cries)

43:45.160 --> 43:47.720
about my hair and everything.

43:53.480 --> 43:54.920
(sniffs)

43:57.040 --> 43:58.240
(kisses)

43:59.000 --> 44:01.600
It's not important.
It'll grow out.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.240
It actually looks...

44:08.000 --> 44:09.280
not that bad...

44:11.600 --> 44:13.320
in my humble opinion.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.440
(Angela)
<i>I fell asleep right there.</i>

44:22.520 --> 44:24.440
<i>I must have been really tired.</i>

44:31.000 --> 44:32.280
(bell rings)

44:34.720 --> 44:36.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.560
-Out on bail?
-Uh... yeah.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.280
So, how was your weekend?

44:49.800 --> 44:50.920
It sucked.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.560
Got to go.

45:02.760 --> 45:05.120
Rayanne,
you are so full of it!

45:05.200 --> 45:07.480
Oh, please. Ask Ricky.
It was wicked!

45:07.560 --> 45:10.440
It was... oh, hey, girlfriend.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.800
-Hey, Angela.
-Ask Angela. She was there.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.000
We hung out with these guys.
They tried to pick them up.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.480
It was wicked, am I right?

45:16.560 --> 45:17.920
And the cops came.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.880
I'm telling you. We had a time.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.800
Didn't we?
Didn't we have a time?

45:23.600 --> 45:24.680
We did.

45:25.560 --> 45:26.680
We had a time.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.720
(dramatic music playing)

45:39.280 --> 45:41.760
