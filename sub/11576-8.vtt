00:59.352 --> 01:01.718
Hey doc, what do
you think about the uh--

01:10.613 --> 01:11.728
Whoa.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.116
Should we help her?

01:18.329 --> 01:22.072
No. No, it's good
for us-- I mean her.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.997
I mean, I think
it's therapeutic.

01:25.503 --> 01:27.710
How many failed
missions does this make?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.459
Girl really
wants that hel-shoe.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.249
(snaps -- music out)

01:39.225 --> 01:40.556
Goodbye, UnderFae guts.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.383
Hello brewskies.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.353
Hey, who do we
pay for the gas?

01:46.565 --> 01:49.022
Leave the money on
the counter. We trust ya.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.361
I got a good
feeling about tonight.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.317
BOTH: Me too.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.384
Yule was always a
major event in my house.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.881
We used to stay up all
night hiding from Krampus.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.680
I still remember the rhyme
we used say to ward him off.

02:21.892 --> 02:22.472
Remember?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.477
Beast of Burden,
fool's delight,

02:26.689 --> 02:29.431
spare me on
this yu|etide night.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.026
Of course back then, Krampus
would actually beat you

02:31.235 --> 02:33.396
with a stick before
he threw you in his sack.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.898
If I may Kenzi in her absence:
who's got cramped-ass?

02:36.115 --> 02:37.355
Kram-pus.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.691
He's like your Santa Claus
only the complete opposite.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.868
He slides down your chimney on
the hottest night of the year.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.695
Mmm sounds
like my kind of elf.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.577
Whoa, whoa are those are
Yule candies for Krampus.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.374
You're gonna be
on his naughty list.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.248
Oh bitch, I am
the naughty list.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.876
Can't argue with that.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.423
Nope.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.131
I am tired, you drive.

03:00.348 --> 03:03.090
My god, I gotta get
out of these wet clothes.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.723
Agh.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.635
After you.

03:11.734 --> 03:12.974
Ow!

03:13.194 --> 03:14.730
(laughs)

03:31.003 --> 03:33.870
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.832
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.713
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:39.929 --> 03:44.798
I was lost for years...
Searching, while hiding.

03:45.017 --> 03:48.976
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.644
I won 't hide anymore.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.938
I will live
the life I choose.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.819
The Lord of Yule,
the son of Hel,

04:02.034 --> 04:05.151
to him our secrets we
must tell. Lest Krampus--

04:05.371 --> 04:06.030
Eugh!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.908
Okay, enough Stephanie Meyer.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.706
How about getting off your
Kringle and help me put up

04:10.918 --> 04:15.002
some tinsel since summer
Christmas was your idea?

04:15.214 --> 04:18.456
Yule is a sacred
celebration of contrition,

04:18.676 --> 04:23.215
not some Franken-holiday
concocted to sell melon ballers.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.763
You have Rudolph
on your sweater.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.556
lt's Eikpyrnir, the stag!

04:27.768 --> 04:29.144
He has a red nose!

04:29.353 --> 04:30.934
lt's Rudolph.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.730
Oh, welcome to
Santa's workshop.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.897
Ni hao.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.520
How're all my
favorite Nutcrackers?

04:37.736 --> 04:38.361
Tired.

04:38.571 --> 04:39.856
We hit another dead end.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.312
Actually, it was an ogre.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.487
Huh.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.065
Who knew finding a
magical hel-shoe could

04:44.285 --> 04:45.400
be quite so difficult.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.699
Place looks great K-star.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.368
Thanks.

04:48.581 --> 04:49.240
So where's Hale?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.697
Who's Hale?

04:51.584 --> 04:52.289
l'm Krampus.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.707
Get in my sack!

04:53.919 --> 04:54.624
Ou... Whoa!

04:54.837 --> 04:58.000
Buy a girl a
drink first, horny.

05:03.596 --> 05:04.426
Place looks great!

05:04.638 --> 05:05.343
Thanks.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.420
Guess you've had
your hands full.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.221
Not as full as
they're gonna be.

05:08.434 --> 05:08.923
Ouu.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.804
Ahem.

05:11.020 --> 05:14.604
Oh, uh okay--
people listen up!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.351
Bo-Bo has been very
stressed out lately

05:16.567 --> 05:18.603
so we want to
show her a good time.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.310
So I don't wanna see
any Fa-la-la-la-lazy-ass

05:21.530 --> 05:22.030
partying tonight!

05:22.239 --> 05:23.228
Got it?

05:23.449 --> 05:24.529
Full on partying. Got it.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.824
That's right, we have to show
Bo that we still love her.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.321
Yes, that even
though she's Dark...

05:28.537 --> 05:29.743
...suffering from
Wanderer PTSD...

05:29.955 --> 05:31.456
That we are here for her.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.826
That she is not alone.

05:34.043 --> 05:34.782
Yup.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.082
Here, here.

05:37.546 --> 05:45.419
(seasonal music playing)

05:45.638 --> 05:47.549
Oh gross.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.721
How long was I out?

05:54.063 --> 05:57.521
I can't believe
they just left me.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.349
And I'm talking
to myself, perfect.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.374
Yes! (laughing)

06:21.590 --> 06:22.750
S'up, s'up.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.128
You got the disease,
Choga got the cure.

06:25.344 --> 06:29.633
lt's cash only but uh, for
you, Choga work something out.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.133
What is a Choga?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.136
Man, how you
don't know Choga?

06:33.352 --> 06:35.764
l'm side to side,
up and down the dial, yo.

06:35.980 --> 06:39.393
So, uh, tick tock, you wanna
ride the dragon or what?

06:39.608 --> 06:41.394
Was any of that English?

06:42.403 --> 06:45.520
Mmm you ain't never
had a high so fly girl.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.775
Let's not bother
the nice lady.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.315
Hi Bo.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.241
Happy Yule.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.193
Thank you Bruce.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.029
Arm pits is half-price!

06:56.667 --> 06:59.784
And now I'm tasting
vomit and | just got here.

07:00.004 --> 07:01.960
Yeah Choga could
work around that.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.881
Oi Choga, give us a lick.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.926
Is that what I think it is?

07:10.139 --> 07:12.221
It was addressed to the
Dark Archives care of Bo

07:12.433 --> 07:13.513
in Bo's handwriting.

07:13.726 --> 07:16.138
And not only did I
not tell her about it,

07:16.353 --> 07:17.729
I kinda opened it.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.724
Yeah, I can see that.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.809
We can't give this to her.

07:22.026 --> 07:22.856
Says you.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.402
(gaSPS)

07:24.612 --> 07:24.976
Whoa, hey!

07:25.195 --> 07:25.945
Hey!

07:26.155 --> 07:27.986
You guys scared
the chi out of me.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.529
[LAUREN] Dyson's fault.
[DYSON] Sorry.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.073
And what is with this party?

07:31.285 --> 07:32.365
Did everyone here lick Choga?

07:32.578 --> 07:34.864
I don't know, ask Vex
they came together.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.332
And thank you for feeding my
growing abandonment issues

07:37.541 --> 07:40.078
by leaving me
alone in the car.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.034
At least you have two hands.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.041
I mean, I've only got one and
fourteen more of these to drink.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.417
Is this my corset?

07:46.634 --> 07:48.670
You can't own possessions!

07:48.886 --> 07:50.251
Kenzi!

07:51.305 --> 07:52.715
Bo--

07:55.267 --> 07:57.178
We're gonna need more booze.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.383
Ag reed.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.316
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

08:06.528 --> 08:06.857
Damn girl.

08:07.071 --> 08:08.231
Let me catch up.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.857
Oh no, it's
probably just gas.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.610
Yeah, sexy gas.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.531
Daddy's gonna fill your tank.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.609
Excuse me?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.080
lgnore that.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.154
I'll get it better next time.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.034
Kenzi's door is locked.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.790
Fine but she's never been
with a Fae before, you know?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.213
And Hale better
behave himself, but still,

08:28.425 --> 08:31.337
can you believe she hasn't
even come down to check on me?

08:31.553 --> 08:33.930
Oh, and speaking
of inconsiderate--

08:34.139 --> 08:36.630
Hello, Lauren, Dyson,
the new Wonder Twins?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.839
Am I right?

08:38.060 --> 08:40.051
If you can't beat 'em...

08:40.270 --> 08:43.137
Join 'em? I can't even get
them to notice l was missing.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.472
Again!

08:44.692 --> 08:48.355
Yule is the perfect occasion
to confront one's fears.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.357
Fears? Me? Please.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.360
Okay so, maybe I'm running
out of excuses to not get back

08:54.576 --> 08:56.953
on that train but... why am
I even telling you all this?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.322
Who are you?

08:58.539 --> 09:01.030
Sometimes the answers
are staring us in the face.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.583
Hilarious.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.002
Always kills at the orphanage.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.956
(laughing)

09:11.927 --> 09:13.838
Bo!

09:14.054 --> 09:14.713
YouWe
here?I

09:14.930 --> 09:16.215
Tamsin--?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.339
I am so sorry.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.520
What was that for?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.351
Doesn't matter.

09:30.571 --> 09:34.530
You're not going to remember
any of this in two seconds.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.356
(crash)

09:35.576 --> 09:37.532
Opa!

09:38.078 --> 09:45.120
(seasonal jingle playing)

09:45.335 --> 09:47.041
What the eff?

10:04.146 --> 10:10.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah! (laughing)

10:10.944 --> 10:12.024
S'up, s'up.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.569
You got the disease,
Choga got the cure.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.364
Seriously, what the
hell did you slip me?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.362
(sucks his teeth)
Man, you know Choga.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.864
l'm side to side,
up and down the dial, yo.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.538
So uh, tick tock, you wanna
ride the dragon or what?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.241
No no, we already did this.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.703
Naw, Choga never
forgets a tongue girl.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.255
Let's not bother
the nice lady, Choga.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.544
Hi Bo.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.170
Happy Yule.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.638
Armpits is half price.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.135
Thanks... Bruce.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.386
Again.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.689
Yo! Valkyrie lips!

10:55.906 --> 10:57.362
What was that?

10:57.574 --> 10:58.404
You actually remember!

10:58.617 --> 11:00.107
I'm not alone!
I can't believe this.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.442
What is going on?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.529
In about three seconds
Fugly over there calls

11:05.749 --> 11:07.205
Brunette by the wrong name.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.035
You're so hot, Chrissie.

11:11.255 --> 11:12.870
(slap)

11:13.090 --> 11:14.125
That's not my name.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.252
Oh, Carrie.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.878
(slap)

11:18.095 --> 11:19.585
lt's Jeanette.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.716
l was way off.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.548
Lady Roids makes it about
two more sips before...

11:24.768 --> 11:28.226
(cheering and chanting "chug")

11:28.438 --> 11:30.144
(burps)

11:30.357 --> 11:31.688
Fire in the hole.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.983
Oh good god, I can
smell that from here.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.059
She's a Sasquatch.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.236
She probably ate
like a hundred kittens.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.153
And... duck.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.947
(smack)

11:41.159 --> 11:42.535
I said duck.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.871
How long have you
been doing Groundhog Day?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.571
And haven't you
tried telling anyone?

11:47.791 --> 11:50.203
Like, oh my gosh-- I didn't
even think about that

11:50.419 --> 11:51.750
like a hundred times.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.624
Hey you, I know this is gonna
sound crazy but we are stuck

11:54.840 --> 11:56.125
in some sort
of quantum paradox

11:56.341 --> 11:58.377
and the same night keeps
repeating over and over again.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.755
(laughs) Yule Fools!

12:00.971 --> 12:04.054
Thanks asshat.
Good luck with that rash.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.881
What?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.602
You'll find out.

12:10.147 --> 12:14.390
No matter who I tell I get the
same reaction. Over and over.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.816
Nothing...

12:16.028 --> 12:17.689
Until you and I kissed.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.870
Nada.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.240
Speak for yourself.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.457
Anyway. Maybe you need to
do it with someone you have a

12:35.672 --> 12:37.708
connection with. Have you
talked to Lauren or Dyson...

12:37.925 --> 12:40.758
You mean the same people that
left me in the car, alone?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.084
Besides I already
went upstairs.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.384
They're being weird with Vex.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.713
And Kenzi hasn't even
come to check on me.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.642
Eugh, please, that girl's
stuck from Hale to Eternity.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.764
Besides, for them
it's just party as usual.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.595
They are not
stuck in the loop.

12:53.815 --> 12:54.474
Say opa.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.316
What?

12:55.525 --> 12:59.268
Th ree-two-one...

12:59.488 --> 13:00.147
(crash)

13:00.364 --> 13:02.070
Opa!

13:02.658 --> 13:09.325
(seasonal jingle playing)

13:09.539 --> 13:11.825
'Cause this song just
gets better and better...

13:18.090 --> 13:19.830
He is getting a rash.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.460
Everywhere.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.092
Oh yeah!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.920
We can drink to that.

13:27.140 --> 13:27.925
S'up, s'up.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.972
Bruce.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.391
Bruce?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.104
Yo, whatchyou calling
that meat mountain for?

13:33.313 --> 13:34.393
He can't fill
your prescription!

13:34.606 --> 13:36.016
(smack)

13:40.445 --> 13:41.480
You know what? Screw it.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.233
lam calling time
out on the Hel-shoes,

13:43.448 --> 13:46.030
on being Dark, all of it.
Everyone here is having fun.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.404
Now it is my turn.
Starting with him.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.362
Oh yeah, I got to him
about fifteen repeats ago.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.866
Well that settles it.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.995
Time to get our Yule on.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.538
(shouting and cheering)

14:00.757 --> 14:02.042
Yeah!

14:04.553 --> 14:10.674
(chanting "chug")

14:10.892 --> 14:13.224
(cheering)

14:17.566 --> 14:19.181
Woohoo!

14:20.235 --> 14:21.350
Here? In front of everybody?

14:21.570 --> 14:22.730
Oh they won't remember.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.733
Besides, tell me this
wasn't on your list.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.112
(everyone cheers)

14:34.958 --> 14:37.415
To commence the annual Yule
drinking game we shall drink

14:37.627 --> 14:40.460
to decide whether or not we
tell Bo about the box. Agreed?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.878
Ag reed.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.079
Pros.

14:43.300 --> 14:47.760
Okay, well Bo is always
very big on the truth.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.211
True.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.011
Cons.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.809
Cons: We may lose Bo to the big
locomotive in the sky forever.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.308
Well as somebody who knows
Bo beyond her rack size

14:59.524 --> 15:00.479
and underwear line--

15:00.692 --> 15:01.852
Oo, burn!

15:02.069 --> 15:05.436
I think that the best course
of action is some caution.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.818
Because although I love her,
you know she is sometimes

15:09.034 --> 15:10.945
a very sexy bull
in a china shop.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.369
Well as someone who sacrificed
his love to save Bo's life...

15:14.581 --> 15:15.536
Oh, wow god, really.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.204
Boﬁng.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.451
Hi.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.373
...rather than lying to
her countless times...

15:19.586 --> 15:20.041
Wow.

15:20.253 --> 15:20.628
Mmhmm.

15:20.837 --> 15:21.792
A-mazing!

15:22.005 --> 15:23.370
Let me just say that
I've learned that Bo

15:23.590 --> 15:23.828
can handle herself.

15:24.049 --> 15:27.883
And it is never a good idea to
get in the way of Bo's destiny.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.380
Oh, should I tell Bo--

15:29.596 --> 15:31.712
Bo doesn't love me--

15:31.932 --> 15:35.299
Come on, let's figure out what
to do with this mystery package

15:35.519 --> 15:37.885
and settle the enigma of
the most boring threesome

15:38.105 --> 15:41.893
ever once and for all!
Present your cases to me!

15:42.109 --> 15:45.272
And I shall deliberate!

15:45.487 --> 15:47.148
What do you think?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.525
I probably think the opposite
of whatever you think.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.947
Granted.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.695
But you realize we're
about to listen to Vex. Right?

15:52.911 --> 15:55.072
Who is sorta
kinda Bo's pet now.

15:55.288 --> 15:55.868
C'mon now.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.696
Come to Team Vex.

15:57.916 --> 16:04.913
Where ye shall be judged,
most worthy of Bo's box.

16:06.591 --> 16:13.929
(seasonal jingle playing)

16:14.141 --> 16:17.258
Round and round we go,
where she stops nobody knows.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.720
Kenzi was pretty
bummed when you left.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.682
Yeah I just needed
to find my kind.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.812
Other Valkyries.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.519
Find myself, if you will.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.320
Did you?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.028
l have a lot to amend for.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.700
Oh. Who doesn't.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.743
Happy Yule, Valkryie.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.503
Bo, there's something I
need to talk to you about--

16:51.386 --> 16:53.342
Well that's new.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.216
And definitely bad.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.634
Opa?

16:59.811 --> 17:06.899
(seasonal music playing)

17:07.110 --> 17:08.725
Holy shit.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.820
Good, stick together.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.368
S'up, s'up. You got
the disease, Choga got--

17:18.580 --> 17:19.865
You think Mama
Choga wanted you

17:20.081 --> 17:22.823
to leave the lilypad to
become a sweat peddler? Huh?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.249
You're better than this!

17:24.461 --> 17:26.702
And stay away from the walls!

17:27.422 --> 17:28.878
Okay, I have
looked everywhere.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.001
Great-hair McCutie is gone.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.049
Okay, well whatever took
him must have something

17:33.261 --> 17:34.546
to do with the time shifts.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.004
Okay, but, you think maybe it
has something to do with me?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.339
Because what I'm saying is
everything terrible 'round here

17:38.558 --> 17:39.843
usually has to do with me.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.971
No. Chill, Tamsin, okay?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.052
Has anyone else gone missing
since you've been here?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.387
I don't know.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.438
| just thought everyone
got drunk and took off.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.891
Bruce.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.317
He was here, helping me lift
amphibian-arms out of my way.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.564
And now he's gone.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.362
Yeah, but Bruce
is like gamma ray huge!

17:54.574 --> 17:55.905
What or who could have...

17:56.117 --> 17:57.857
Suck him into the walls?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.864
Okay, tell me everything
you remember before

18:00.080 --> 18:01.240
you got to the party.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.697
Did you piss off a wizard or
something along your travels?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.954
No, no |-- I took the 43 bus,
I got off at the gas station,

18:07.170 --> 18:10.037
I got a pack of gum, and I
came straight here. I swear.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.543
Okay, well we need to
stop this thing before it

18:12.759 --> 18:13.919
snatches someone else.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.420
Ok, um... How?

18:15.637 --> 18:17.753
I don't know. Normally in
these situations I just ask--

18:17.973 --> 18:19.258
BOTH: Trick!

18:19.474 --> 18:22.181
He should be easy to find, he's
wearing one helluva a sweater.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.517
First time I saw Bo?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.846
I knew she was special.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.351
And trouble.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.397
No argument here.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.441
Mmhmm.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.939
Amen.

18:34.155 --> 18:39.240
But if I hadn't been there to
give her the old-- the wolf-chi

18:39.452 --> 18:41.864
power up she would not
have survived those trials.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.365
Puh-lease.

18:43.581 --> 18:47.199
Hahaha, so in a way... I'm
responsible for her still being

18:47.419 --> 18:52.163
here so I should choose what
to do with her box-- the box.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.464
Objection!

18:54.676 --> 18:56.337
Alright, no, a point
for trying to win.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.589
But minus a point
for not noticing

18:58.805 --> 19:00.045
myjubblies in this bra.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.630
I'm not playing that game.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.927
When I first met Bo she
didn't even know her hole

19:07.147 --> 19:09.513
from an ass in the
ground. She was all like--

19:09.733 --> 19:12.850
I'm a killer, get in my
way and I'm gonna kill you--

19:13.069 --> 19:14.775
that's what killers
do. That's right.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.353
And then I curbed her hunger.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.110
Then she was like "maybe
I'm okay, I'm not so bad."

19:19.326 --> 19:21.863
And I love her also,
so I think that we should

19:22.078 --> 19:24.364
just throw the box
in the fire, voila.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.367
The Doctor, thank
you very much, rests!

19:26.583 --> 19:29.871
Agh, Bo gets kidnapped
by mysterious black smoke,

19:30.086 --> 19:33.704
sends herself
an ominous package--

19:33.923 --> 19:36.835
why are we
fighting about this?

19:37.052 --> 19:38.007
I don't know, Dyson.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.175
I don't know anything.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.924
Neither do |.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.430
How is it that you can
love somebody so much and--

19:47.645 --> 19:49.772
Keep letting 'em down?

19:53.401 --> 19:54.982
Exactly.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.111
Still working
on that one too.

20:01.576 --> 20:02.861
Come here you.

20:03.078 --> 20:03.692
C'mon Doctor.

20:03.912 --> 20:04.651
Hah.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.702
Hug it out.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.405
Been a long time.
Give it to me.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.115
Give me some love.
Give me some love.

20:13.338 --> 20:13.918
Okay.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.040
Oi--

20:15.256 --> 20:16.120
Okay.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.753
So what does the
genius get, you know,

20:18.968 --> 20:21.220
who organized
this little Kumbaya?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.841
You! Get your
hand re-attached.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.799
By me. Rrright now.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.350
Drunken surgery.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.347
I'll be the nurse.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.188
Ooh.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.265
Ooh, this is getting kinky...

20:37.445 --> 20:41.108
Oh, Trick. Trick, you have no
idea how good it is to see you.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.155
You can't prove I did that.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.656
Wow. Okay, easy does it.

20:47.539 --> 20:48.403
How long I been out?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.284
What is the last
thing you remember?

20:50.500 --> 20:53.116
l was helping Kenzi with the
decorations and the doorbell

20:53.336 --> 20:54.997
kept ringing, and
something about...?

20:55.213 --> 20:57.454
Oprah!

20:57.674 --> 20:59.585
You're pretty.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.632
[BO] Okay, look you
have to listen to me.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.130
This is going
to sound outrageous

21:03.346 --> 21:04.631
but you have to believe me.

21:04.848 --> 21:05.883
Of course.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.009
You're my grand-dubus.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.214
My succy-daughter.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.346
Okay, we're stuck in
some kind of time loop.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.847
Time keeps repeating.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.678
I need water.

21:14.441 --> 21:14.725
Mmm.

21:14.941 --> 21:15.600
It gets worse.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.852
Okay. People are disappearing.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.605
One we know for sure
but there could be more.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.685
We really need your--

21:20.905 --> 21:21.690
(crash) Opa!

21:21.906 --> 21:27.446
(seasonal music playing)

21:27.662 --> 21:30.449
Oh, I hope Kenzi's having
better luck than I am.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.034
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.041
I'm gonna mingle with your
tingle like I'm single, girl.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.872
Say what now?

21:41.092 --> 21:48.339
(seasonal music playing)

21:48.558 --> 21:51.015
It does not smell
amazing in here.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.439
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.560
| feel it too, it's
like a burning sensation.

21:58.776 --> 21:59.481
Huh?

21:59.694 --> 22:08.739
(seasonal music playing)

22:08.953 --> 22:10.693
These aren't mine.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.787
My Kenzi sense is tingling.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.118
That's just my love train,

22:18.338 --> 22:22.206
pulling into your
tunnel of... love.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.050
(slap)

22:23.259 --> 22:28.754
(seasonal music playing)

22:28.973 --> 22:30.383
Dammit!

22:31.351 --> 22:35.845
I would have died a thousand
deaths just to meet you,

22:36.064 --> 22:41.354
yet now that l have,
I want to live forever.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.355
Awww... Hale.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.481
That's the one.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.527
That's the one?

22:45.740 --> 22:46.980
Mmhmm.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.610
Okay, um, a little, y'know,

22:48.826 --> 22:50.657
first-time-with-
a-Fae-box from Bo.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.201
Okay... Oh wow.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.369
That's... prepared.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.573
We've got edible,
non-edible, fat-free,

22:56.793 --> 23:01.378
firm, fire-proof,
uh fig flavoured and...

23:03.258 --> 23:04.794
Look, if you
don't wanna do this.

23:05.009 --> 23:09.218
Oh, no l-l do.
Believe me. I do.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.761
(sighs)

23:10.974 --> 23:13.306
Kenzi and Hale,
take sixty-seven.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.350
Okay, ninth time's
the charm, c'mon Trick!

23:20.567 --> 23:21.272
Concentrate!

23:21.484 --> 23:22.849
You can't prove I did that.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.685
Okay, we're in a time loop the
walls are eating people, help!

23:25.905 --> 23:26.769
Oh this...

23:26.990 --> 23:27.979
this is bad.

23:28.199 --> 23:28.654
What?

23:28.866 --> 23:29.821
Una Mens bad?

23:30.034 --> 23:31.535
Smoke-nappers bad?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.609
Six more
weeks of winter bad?

23:33.830 --> 23:34.068
What!?

23:34.289 --> 23:34.869
Bwahahah!

23:35.081 --> 23:36.287
Yule fools!

23:36.499 --> 23:37.534
He's useless to us.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.455
You're pretty.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.032
I know.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.287
He's been useless.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.869
Look, I've been wanting
to say this for a while.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.922
I know that you haven't
helped me find the Wanderer.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.840
Why?

23:48.052 --> 23:51.260
Because I'm terrified.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.552
What aren't you telling me?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.505
Okay, I don't mean
to rush you but--

23:54.726 --> 23:55.636
Opa!

23:55.852 --> 24:01.848
(seasonal music playing)

24:02.066 --> 24:05.433
Oh dammit, Trick.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.894
Who else knows about Yule?

24:12.410 --> 24:13.320
Hale!

24:13.536 --> 24:14.696
Something is going
on, we're in danger,

24:14.912 --> 24:15.947
it could be Una Mens.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.028
We've tried this already.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.579
And nobody is
taking us seriously.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.373
Nah, Una Mens ain't dumb
enough to cause trouble on Yule.

24:21.586 --> 24:22.871
Hell, they're probably
off playing kissyface

24:23.087 --> 24:23.951
under the mistletoe.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.537
Please don't
tell them I said that.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.590
Well whoever it is, we need all
hands on deck. Where's Kenzi?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.257
Off freshenin' up. Again.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.631
Opa!

24:32.847 --> 24:34.508
Comet, Cupid, and Blitzen.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.510
You know about the loop.

24:36.726 --> 24:37.681
You're in on it!

24:37.894 --> 24:39.885
Haha, Krampus got
both of you too?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.060
Oh man, he's got skills.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.479
Hold up.

24:43.691 --> 24:47.229
This entire thing is just
some stupid holiday prank?

24:47.445 --> 24:48.025
Seriously?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.488
Krampus?

24:49.697 --> 24:51.528
You mean that Anti-Claus Fae
you guys we're talking about?

24:51.741 --> 24:54.778
Yeah, every year he picks a few
Yule fools to repeat the night.

24:54.994 --> 24:55.779
It's totally harmless.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.075
Harmless?

24:57.288 --> 24:59.199
We just saw some guy get
sucked into the wallpaper.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.074
What?

25:00.291 --> 25:01.827
No, no Krampus
feeds on regret.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.874
That's why he puts
people in the loop;

25:04.087 --> 25:06.669
sooner or later they'll
get into all kinds of trouble.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.212
Hey Kiebler, what
the hell's going on here?

25:12.428 --> 25:14.009
You call this a Yule party?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.052
No fruit?

25:15.264 --> 25:16.845
No offerings to Vanir?

25:17.058 --> 25:18.798
No wassailing.

25:19.018 --> 25:19.882
And this...

25:20.103 --> 25:21.218
This has no business here!

25:21.437 --> 25:23.769
Oh now we gettin' all up
in each other's business?!

25:23.981 --> 25:26.563
This mangy cur is
not Eikpyrnir, the stag.

25:26.776 --> 25:27.401
lt's Rudolph!

25:27.610 --> 25:28.690
I knew it!

25:28.903 --> 25:30.689
Trick has got to hear this.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.941
Bo-Bo, where you been?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.193
Where have I been?

25:35.410 --> 25:36.399
(scoffs)

25:36.619 --> 25:38.780
Hey, buddy. I am starting
to think you were not

25:38.996 --> 25:40.861
technically invited.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.915
Krampusnacht is a night
that people should revere.

25:44.127 --> 25:44.536
You'll rue the day that

25:44.752 --> 25:46.743
you chose to desecrate
the Yule Lord!

25:49.507 --> 25:50.622
Bo, watch out!

25:51.759 --> 25:53.715
(gasps and screams)

25:53.928 --> 25:55.714
Sweet Christmas.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.180
Kenzi?

26:00.393 --> 26:02.554
Upstairs safe with Trick.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.806
Was that shitty-Santa-
whats-his-name,

26:05.022 --> 26:06.307
Krampus?

26:06.524 --> 26:07.855
Krampus ain't supposed
to space suck people.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.683
No, he-he'sjust a kindly
old prankster who whisks

26:10.903 --> 26:13.315
naughty children off
in his sack to Candyland.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.566
Yeah well apparently
he really

26:14.782 --> 26:16.693
stepped up his game this year.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.160
How do | find him?

26:18.369 --> 26:21.202
Uh, we go back to wherever
we showed up on his radar,

26:21.414 --> 26:22.119
I guess.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.537
Which could be anywhere.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.038
Okay, Tamsin
stopped to buy gum.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.209
She got off
the number 43 bus--

26:29.422 --> 26:30.207
Which goes right by--

26:30.423 --> 26:31.333
The gas station.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.164
Oh god, what if
something happens to her?

26:33.384 --> 26:34.590
Stay calm.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.339
If we got one thing on our
side it's time. Remember?

26:37.555 --> 26:37.793
God, Hale why would you

26:38.014 --> 26:40.471
put yourself through
this voluntarily?

26:42.310 --> 26:43.925
Wait...

26:44.145 --> 26:44.930
You and... Kenzi?

26:45.146 --> 26:46.226
God, that is just skeevy.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.021
It's the opposite of skeevy!

26:49.233 --> 26:53.146
Okay, look I had a
chance to perfect my game.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.693
So to speak.

26:54.906 --> 26:56.862
I swear I was
going to tell her.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.109
I think you just did.

26:58.326 --> 26:59.691
What?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.860
Who's the Yule fool now, hm?

27:04.415 --> 27:07.282
No wait, just leave
her. In a few minutes

27:07.502 --> 27:10.084
she won't remember
any of this anyway. Right?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.046
Maybe.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.916
Doesn't make it right.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.872
(crash)

27:16.010 --> 27:17.841
Opa!

27:20.014 --> 27:21.345
Thanks for the party.

27:21.557 --> 27:22.342
Why am | itchy?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.173
I didn't start
back in the car.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.428
What happened?

27:25.645 --> 27:26.930
Are we done
repeating the loop?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.352
What does this mean?

27:28.564 --> 27:30.179
It means Krampus has found
someone with enough regret

27:30.399 --> 27:31.479
to tide him over.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.025
And as for us, well
we're back to normal time.

27:35.238 --> 27:38.526
So life continues...
without Tamsin.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.527
Oh, I gotta get
to that gas station.

27:40.743 --> 27:42.279
You stay here and
protect everybody else.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.655
Whoa-- Bo.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.535
Blade of steel, hilt of bone.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.537
Yuletide Eve, you must atone.

27:50.753 --> 27:55.338
Look, Krampus may be a joke but
that doesn't make him harmless.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.301
Thank you.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.307
Pee on the post, go on!

28:07.520 --> 28:08.851
All right, all right.
Whoa, whoa--

28:09.063 --> 28:10.769
Here it is, here it is.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.018
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

28:13.234 --> 28:14.144
Are you kidding me?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.691
She could do a brainopsy

28:15.903 --> 28:17.518
with both hands
tied behind her back.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.865
That is not a thing,
but thank you.

28:20.074 --> 28:23.191
Please, can you please
confirm that this is your hand.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.776
I'm going to
need more sedatives.

28:24.996 --> 28:30.036
Hey, honestly what are
we doing with Bo's box?

28:30.251 --> 28:33.084
Well obviously we
can't give it to her.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.331
Why obviously?

28:34.547 --> 28:36.287
Because Dyson, if I said
green, you'd say purple,

28:36.507 --> 28:37.542
just to get my goat.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.010
I don't want your goat.
I can get any goat I want.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.334
I'm a good goat-catcher--

28:41.554 --> 28:44.796
Oh, you both want the same
goat. We get it already.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.723
What you two don't get...

28:47.935 --> 28:50.802
is that you don't
hate each other anymore.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.358
Okay, what's in this stuff?

28:57.570 --> 28:59.060
A whole lotta truth...

28:59.280 --> 29:00.736
and a little
bit 0' Choga sweat.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.609
Woohoo!

29:03.409 --> 29:04.524
You know, he's right though.

29:04.744 --> 29:08.202
I haven't hated
you for a long time.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.372
You're the only one that
gets my predicament, Wolfie.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.745
And you make me laugh.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.711
To us.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.130
To Bo.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.128
To drunken surgery.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.675
Gah!

29:25.056 --> 29:25.966
Ouu mmmm.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.639
Get away from me.
I gotta put that on you.

29:31.520 --> 29:31.770
(slapping)

29:31.979 --> 29:33.560
Tamsin?!

29:43.491 --> 29:46.324
Tamsin?

29:46.535 --> 29:47.695
Are you here?

30:09.225 --> 30:10.715
Tamsin?

30:11.394 --> 30:16.058
Oh, and it's back
in the car again.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.025
Come to stuff my stocking
with your Yule log again, stud?

30:25.241 --> 30:28.483
I'm so sorry Little
Mama, that was stupid.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.660
So how many times did we...?

30:34.875 --> 30:36.126
No, none.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.200
Not once. I swear.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.584
I mean we came close a
couple times but we never...

30:41.799 --> 30:44.506
Connected?

30:44.719 --> 30:49.338
Look | just wanted to
make this night perfect,

30:49.557 --> 30:50.637
you know?

30:56.856 --> 30:59.188
Look dude, I dig you.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.516
But be real.
You're Fae, l'm human.

31:01.736 --> 31:03.772
It's never gonna be perfect.

31:08.451 --> 31:12.820
And I wouldn't
have it any other way.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.654
ljust didn't
want to disappoint you.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.205
Are you kidding me?

31:16.417 --> 31:20.911
The Casanova of Clan Zamora?

31:21.130 --> 31:22.461
I've never done this before.

31:25.468 --> 31:29.586
With someone...
I really care about.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.810
Whoa.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.068
Where you goin'?

31:50.284 --> 31:52.991
To freshen up.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.536
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.166
There's no rush.

32:00.377 --> 32:01.878
We have time.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.670
Eugh!

32:31.742 --> 32:33.653
(screaming in pain)

32:46.757 --> 32:49.339
What the hell is this place?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.642
Tamsin?

33:00.855 --> 33:01.469
Oh hey, Bo!

33:01.689 --> 33:02.804
How you doing?

33:03.023 --> 33:04.684
I'm gonna get you out of here.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.150
No.

33:05.359 --> 33:06.815
It's okay.

33:07.027 --> 33:12.067
I've been naughty but
now I'm gonna be candy!

33:12.283 --> 33:14.820
I already broke
the machine once.

33:15.035 --> 33:18.198
Now l have to
wait to be candy!

33:19.081 --> 33:21.117
Okay, brainwashed Betty.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.369
Listen up. Have
you been naughty?

33:23.586 --> 33:24.996
Yes, who hasn't?

33:25.212 --> 33:26.873
But you are a good person.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.704
And despite all,
you are my friend.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.461
And I'm not
leaving you behind!

33:31.677 --> 33:34.339
If they make
me into a lollipop,

33:34.555 --> 33:36.671
I want you to
have the first lick.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.051
Alright, that is it.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.178
I'm getting you out of here.

33:42.771 --> 33:43.271
Eugh!

33:43.480 --> 33:45.937
Those are on too tight.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.061
I need something to stop the--

33:56.577 --> 33:58.613
Eugh. Hale I could kiss you.

34:00.289 --> 34:01.699
Eugh!

34:03.125 --> 34:06.208
Okay come on, let's go.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.876
You're not going anywhere.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.373
And why would we want to?

34:09.590 --> 34:11.046
(laughs)

34:11.258 --> 34:12.543
Silly girls.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.216
This is the belly of Yule.

34:14.428 --> 34:16.384
This is where
sour becomes sweet.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.178
And naughty becomes nice.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.676
Uh, no this is where
the Succubus goes bad Santa

34:20.893 --> 34:22.383
on your badly camoflaged ass.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.683
Because all this?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.306
This is just bad Christmas!

34:25.522 --> 34:26.682
Blasphemer!

34:26.899 --> 34:28.890
The Valkryie is mine by
the ancient laws of Yule.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.236
Oh yeah? Well by the powers
vested in me by merry old

34:31.445 --> 34:33.777
Saint Nick, I say
she's coming with me.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.321
Fine. Take her.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.318
If you can.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.241
(evil chuckle)

34:40.955 --> 34:41.944
Come on.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.779
Ou!

34:45.459 --> 34:47.541
Tamsin I'm going
to need your help,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.084
I can't do this without you.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.208
But if they make me candy,
I can't hurt anyone anymore.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.755
Then everyone will like me.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.208
I like you--

34:55.970 --> 34:58.336
You won't like me
when I confess the truth.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.518
I'm the reason
the Wanderer found you.

35:08.065 --> 35:13.355
In a previous life I hunted
Fae fugitives for a price.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.481
l was a Valkyrie.

35:15.698 --> 35:17.438
l was the best.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.239
And l was greedy.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.488
One look into his eyes

35:22.705 --> 35:27.699
and I knew I'd never
really met true evil.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.625
Not until then.

35:30.838 --> 35:33.875
I told my self I was
powerless to refuse this beast

35:34.091 --> 35:37.709
so I accepted his
bounty to find a woman.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.884
I took comfort that
the girl he described

35:40.097 --> 35:42.258
couldn't possibly exist.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.726
Eyes both brown and blue.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.426
Virtuous, yet lustful.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.355
Neither Dark
nor Light, yet both.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.018
So you see...

35:55.237 --> 35:57.102
You weren't
supposed to be real.

36:00.284 --> 36:03.321
And the fact that I helped
that monster find you...

36:03.537 --> 36:06.495
Hey, Tamsin, listen to me.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.663
None of that matters now.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.491
Do you understand?

36:10.711 --> 36:15.501
Hey, I forgive you.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.174
So, no respect
for the old ways?

36:26.393 --> 36:27.724
We'll see about that.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.928
Buddy, you are about ten pounds
of crazy in a two pound bag.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.012
Admit you ate it.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.267
Admit it!

36:33.484 --> 36:35.941
Whoa, whoa whoa, that's
what this is all about?

36:36.153 --> 36:39.020
We're here because we ate
your gas station people candy?

36:39.239 --> 36:41.525
People used to cower at
the mere mention of Krampus.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.573
Theyjust need a reminder.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.027
Well Krampus, or whatever
the hell your name is--

36:46.246 --> 36:48.737
He's not Krampus...

36:48.957 --> 36:50.913
lam.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.878
(evil chuckle)

37:02.554 --> 37:10.723
(singing to himself)

37:10.938 --> 37:13.054
Holy shit.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.433
(laughs)

37:14.650 --> 37:16.857
Hold that thought.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.684
You promised this
would be my year!

37:18.904 --> 37:20.860
SHence.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.064
Children are such
a delight, aren't they?

37:23.283 --> 37:25.490
But they get a little
bit more over zealous

37:25.702 --> 37:26.987
when they try to please.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.741
Now what seems
to be the bother?

37:29.957 --> 37:32.539
Uh, the bother, is that
Jeffrey over here is trying

37:32.751 --> 37:34.491
to turn my friends
into human gobstoppers.

37:34.711 --> 37:38.169
So go Wonka-fy someone else
cause that ain't happening.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.338
Jeffrey, is this true?

37:40.551 --> 37:42.587
They're both worthy
offerings but I choose her.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.668
Aww... Lucky.

37:44.888 --> 37:45.843
You choose her?

37:46.056 --> 37:48.388
Du-du-du-du, ladies please.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.808
A sacrifice must be made.
The laws on this are clear.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.511
Yes, yes | see.

37:54.731 --> 37:58.223
Again, allow me to
apologize for the boy,

37:58.444 --> 38:00.981
he has a little bit
of growing to do.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.936
(laughs)

38:03.157 --> 38:05.273
Growing-- nevermind.

38:05.492 --> 38:08.029
You can go. (fart sound)

38:08.245 --> 38:10.577
(laughing)

38:10.789 --> 38:12.905
And you. (fart sound)

38:13.584 --> 38:15.040
You too.

38:15.252 --> 38:16.002
I'm telling Mom.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.587
(fart sound)

38:19.381 --> 38:21.167
What the hell
did you do to them?

38:21.383 --> 38:23.339
Oh, I set them
free of course.

38:23.552 --> 38:26.089
So why am I still here?

38:26.305 --> 38:29.217
There's a darkness
in you my child,

38:29.433 --> 38:32.391
enough to make
candy for centuries;

38:32.603 --> 38:34.434
maybe even longer.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.182
And the guilt.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.354
The denial.

38:38.567 --> 38:42.560
Complex emotions
make the best candy.

38:42.779 --> 38:47.239
You, my little succubus...

38:47.451 --> 38:53.663
l have never made
blue candy before.

38:53.874 --> 38:55.114
(fart sound)

38:56.793 --> 38:58.875
Let me go and I'll
consider letting you live.

38:59.087 --> 38:59.712
(laughs)

38:59.922 --> 39:01.207
No, it's better like this.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.835
You see, you won't be
breaking any more hearts;

39:04.051 --> 39:05.291
no more hurting anyone.

39:05.511 --> 39:08.093
You'll just bring sweetness
to everyone you meet.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.670
Is that supposed to scare me?

39:09.890 --> 39:10.879
(laughs)

39:11.099 --> 39:12.760
J‘ Sour becomes sweet. J‘

39:12.976 --> 39:14.512
J‘ Naughty is nice. J‘

39:14.728 --> 39:19.142
J‘ Guilt becomes glue. And
denial is a river in Africa. J‘

39:19.358 --> 39:20.689
I am not afraid of you!

39:20.901 --> 39:21.981
(laughs)

39:22.194 --> 39:23.809
Believe me child
when | tell you--

39:24.029 --> 39:27.487
only the truth
shall set you free.

39:27.699 --> 39:33.990
How can you be pure when you
will not confront your fears?

39:34.206 --> 39:35.491
Okay!

39:35.707 --> 39:37.993
Yes, I'm scared. Is that
what you want to hear?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.916
Aha...

39:40.128 --> 39:43.541
I'm scared of making
the wrong choice.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.669
Of losing my friends
and my family again.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.844
l'm terrified of
what I'll become.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.515
Ooo!

39:55.727 --> 39:57.843
l'm terrified of
what I'm capable of.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.770
l'm terrified of the Wanderer
and what he'll make me!

40:00.983 --> 40:02.063
Aha!

40:02.276 --> 40:06.189
(chuckles)

40:10.200 --> 40:12.532
I'm scared.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.405
Really, really scared.

40:16.873 --> 40:19.205
You don't have to be.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.703
I've got you.

40:23.672 --> 40:24.912
Let's go home.

40:43.525 --> 40:44.981
Are we still...?

40:46.194 --> 40:47.274
It's okay.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.023
Everything's back to normal.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.776
Or at least what you call
normal in this crazy place.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.482
Bruce?

40:53.702 --> 40:54.987
Passed out in your bed.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.034
Lil' nugget was
all tuckered out.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.997
The Wanderer.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.495
That evil that you met.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.498
Could he be my father?

41:08.592 --> 41:11.174
That thing would've
done anything to claim

41:11.386 --> 41:12.671
his ideal mate.

41:13.889 --> 41:16.801
Even if it meant
creating her himself.

41:17.851 --> 41:18.715
Bo!

41:18.935 --> 41:19.890
Are you okay?

41:20.103 --> 41:21.934
Yeah, I'm fine, really.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.854
And you, young lady,
you had me worried sick,

41:25.067 --> 41:26.022
do you know that?

41:26.234 --> 41:29.192
I'm sorry Moms.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.019
We will deal with you later.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.025
| see you and Hale
worked things out.

41:33.241 --> 41:37.029
Oh sister please, I never kiss
and tell... within earshot.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.110
Or do-everything-and-tell-
and-trust-me-we-did-everything.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.662
Whoa!

41:40.874 --> 41:42.034
(puke sound)

41:42.250 --> 41:44.286
There's gotta be something
left to drink in this place.

41:44.503 --> 41:48.121
Uh, oh no, | feel incredibly
bad and I had no idea but,

41:48.340 --> 41:49.876
it's Yule and apparently...

41:50.092 --> 41:51.172
The Dark aren't allowed
to enter a house where Light

41:51.385 --> 41:54.843
are celebrating Yule.
Not after midnight.

41:55.055 --> 41:56.135
It's not the Fae way.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.588
Tamsin.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.389
Lauren left already with Vex.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.186
Uh, she had to A: sober up

42:05.399 --> 42:07.856
and B: uh, sew his
hand on... properly...

42:08.068 --> 42:10.104
it's a really
long story, but um,

42:10.320 --> 42:13.187
I'm not going in with those
jerks. I'm gonna stay with you.

42:13.407 --> 42:15.193
No, no please go inside.

42:15.409 --> 42:16.524
Really.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.449
I need some time to myself.

42:18.662 --> 42:20.903
Sort through a few things.

42:21.123 --> 42:21.487
No.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.447
Honestly, just go.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.659
Well if you're gonna push me--
Oh! And I found this box

42:26.878 --> 42:29.494
on the bed next to Dyson,
who's like totally passed out.

42:29.715 --> 42:32.001
It has your name on it.
