00:11.343 --> 00:12.378
- What in the world

00:11.343 --> 00:12.378
is that?

00:12.412 --> 00:14.800
- What is that?

00:14.114 --> 00:16.216
- It's all the stuff I couldn't

00:14.114 --> 00:16.216
eat when I had braces.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.251
See, now I can eat chips.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.219
Now I can eat gummy worms.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.550
- But son, everything you

00:20.253 --> 00:22.550
couldn't eat

00:22.879 --> 00:23.422
does not mean you should eat

00:23.455 --> 00:24.556
- That's very true.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.126
I'm back, baby.

00:26.158 --> 00:27.559
- Ah.

00:26.158 --> 00:27.559
- [laughs]

00:28.795 --> 00:30.263
Well, now that you've

00:28.795 --> 00:30.263
got your braces off.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.297
When are you gonna

00:30.295 --> 00:31.297
get veneers?

00:31.330 --> 00:32.564
- Yeah daddy, when is he?

00:32.598 --> 00:35.301
- He has got his braces

00:32.598 --> 00:35.301
off for 30 seconds.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.670
You don't need veneers.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.837
- Daddy, he has veneers.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.506
I have veneers, he's next.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.606
- He doesn't have

00:39.539 --> 00:40.606
to have them.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.575
Smile.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.780
Smiling is the window

00:42.609 --> 00:45.780
to the soul.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.579
These two had no soul,

00:46.612 --> 00:47.914
so I had to build them a smile.

00:47.947 --> 00:48.914
- Shut up.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.549
- [laughs]

00:50.582 --> 00:53.118
- Do y'all understand that

00:50.582 --> 00:53.118
I never had braces?

00:53.152 --> 00:54.286
- We know.

00:53.152 --> 00:54.286
- But yet--

00:54.320 --> 00:57.189
But yet I've paid for you

00:54.320 --> 00:57.189
to have braces.

00:57.222 --> 00:58.625
You to have braces.

00:58.658 --> 00:59.859
You to have braces.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.393

01:20.480 --> 01:22.581
for our dinner tonight.

- Why do you cut onions

01:23.149 --> 01:24.751
with gloves on?

01:24.783 --> 01:27.870
- Because I don't like

Woo.

of those gloves?

- Whatever it takes,

Chase.

I'm excited that you bought

01:38.397 --> 01:40.432

01:40.466 --> 01:42.534
I mean, I love that we're

01:40.466 --> 01:42.534
keeping it in the family.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.971
- I know, like, I'm excited

01:42.569 --> 01:44.971
to go in there

01:45.500 --> 01:46.605
and put my touch on it.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.375
'Cause there's a lot that I

01:46.639 --> 01:48.375
want to do.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.876
- You are so your father's

01:48.408 --> 01:49.876
child.

01:49.908 --> 01:51.543
- It's gonna be so cool.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.114
- My parents have given me

01:51.578 --> 01:54.114
an awesome deal

01:54.114 --> 01:55.481
on their old home.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.783
So now I'm just in the process

01:55.515 --> 01:57.783
of kind of turning it

01:57.817 --> 02:00.120
into my dream home.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.120
- But Savannah,

02:00.153 --> 02:02.155
an awesome deal?

02:02.188 --> 02:04.189
Like, does that even exist

02:02.188 --> 02:04.189
with Dad?

02:04.224 --> 02:05.557
- I mean, for me it does.

02:05.591 --> 02:07.694
- Mm, there's gotta be a catch.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.929
- I would never want

02:07.727 --> 02:09.929
to move over there.

02:09.962 --> 02:11.463
Because Dad lived there.

02:11.497 --> 02:14.266
And Savannah, he's gonna pop

02:11.497 --> 02:14.266
in and out at unexpected times.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.201
And I love to stroll around

02:14.300 --> 02:16.201
in the nude.

02:16.235 --> 02:17.704
- What?

02:16.235 --> 02:17.704
- [laughs]

02:17.736 --> 02:19.472

02:17.736 --> 02:19.472
get to be a free spirit.

02:19.506 --> 02:20.473
- Yeah, I'm good.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.841
I'm not a free spirit.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.911
I'm probably the most uptight

02:47.334 --> 02:48.701
- Why?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.701
- I can't drive it

learner's permit.

So what else am I gonna

02:50.103 --> 02:52.171

03:05.852 --> 03:07.152

Nobody sleeps in their car.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.932
- No, sit down douche canoe.

- Dad, I've had it

03:19.966 --> 03:21.668

03:21.700 --> 03:23.469
and I haven't even been able

03:21.700 --> 03:23.469

- Mm-hmm.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.274
- But when?

03:28.307 --> 03:29.808

03:28.307 --> 03:29.808
dragging his feet.

03:29.842 --> 03:30.909
Because now that I'm 15,

03:30.943 --> 03:32.846
I wish he would just get

03:30.943 --> 03:32.846
on with it.

03:32.878 --> 03:35.810
- Be careful what you wish for,

03:32.878 --> 03:35.810
because having Dad

03:35.115 --> 03:37.484
as your driving instructor

- What have you done

07:13.233 --> 07:14.567
to my truck?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.636

You've got the buckle up

When you get in your car,

07:24.209 --> 07:26.478
you lock it up.

That way you're focusing

- It's terrible.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.704
You lucky to be alive.

- Savannah, do you understand

07:50.737 --> 07:53.773
the severity of this?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.675
So I'm making sure that

07:53.807 --> 07:56.675
I identify for every person

07:56.709 --> 08:01.180

07:56.709 --> 08:01.180

08:05.180 --> 08:07.319

my children happy.

It's my job to keep them safe.

- Is they have duck fat.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.625
- It's cooking oil.

09:24.299 --> 09:26.231
for anything.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.534
- You can't let someone steal

09:26.265 --> 09:28.534
your joy.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.836
- I mean, it's just hard

09:28.567 --> 09:30.836
to put my stamp on anything

09:30.870 --> 09:34.399
because he won't let me change

things that I want to change.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.607
With my money.

- Savannah, you buy what

09:35.642 --> 09:38.278
you want to.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.913
- He might get upset

09:38.311 --> 09:40.913

09:40.947 --> 09:43.383
You know, all the stuff

09:40.947 --> 09:43.383
that he does.

09:43.415 --> 09:44.951
But he'll get over it.

09:45.509 --> 09:46.619
I mean, and once it's done,

09:45.509 --> 09:46.619
it's done.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.788
It's not like he's gonna

09:46.653 --> 09:48.788

interesting relationship.

09:53.590 --> 09:55.461

09:53.590 --> 09:55.461
and most of the time

09:55.495 --> 09:56.863
we're on the same page.

09:56.895 --> 09:59.649
But I'm starting to realize

09:56.895 --> 09:59.649
that it's always about

09:59.649 --> 10:04.399
me being on his page, and not

09:59.649 --> 10:04.399
really about being on my page.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.972
- And it's taken you 23 years

10:07.700 --> 10:08.475
- Better late than never.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.942
I mean, it's my house now.

10:09.975 --> 10:12.211
