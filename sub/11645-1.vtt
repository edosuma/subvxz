00:02.158 --> 00:06.515
You can't die. I love you.
I'll still be here.

00:06.850 --> 00:08.129
Where did you get that?

00:08.993 --> 00:10.072
The guy in the mask.

00:10.073 --> 00:10.792
Who is he?

00:10.793 --> 00:13.632
He's you.

00:13.633 --> 00:14.952
So what happens now?

00:14.953 --> 00:16.512
You fall in love with me.

00:16.513 --> 00:19.112
(NATHAN)
No more community service.

00:19.113 --> 00:21.352
I thought we'd be all
celebrating and shit.

00:21.353 --> 00:24.712
All the shit we've been through.
We're all here,

00:24.713 --> 00:26.192
all alive.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.672
We made it.

00:27.673 --> 00:29.992
I can give you your life back.

00:29.993 --> 00:32.712
There's this guy. He took my power.

00:32.713 --> 00:33.912
You sold your powers?

00:33.913 --> 00:34.952
Yeah, mate.

00:34.953 --> 00:36.832
We were given them for a reason.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.552
Do we have to have
the same powers as before?

00:39.553 --> 00:43.512
He said if we've got the money,
we can take our pick.

00:43.513 --> 00:44.992
OK, so who's first?

00:44.993 --> 00:48.992

01:00.833 --> 01:03.592
Right. I need to speak to the...

01:03.593 --> 01:07.592
cool, mysterious...

01:07.593 --> 01:11.592
power guy. Is he, is he in?

01:30.073 --> 01:33.512
What are you doing?

01:33.513 --> 01:37.512
Get back in here!

01:48.833 --> 01:50.032
Sorry!

01:50.033 --> 01:54.032
Wanker!

02:09.312 --> 02:11.512
What the fuck...

02:11.513 --> 02:14.272
do you think you're doing?

02:14.273 --> 02:16.272
Think you can get rid of me?

02:16.273 --> 02:17.352
I'm a part of you.

02:17.353 --> 02:19.912
Cool power guy with the suits,

02:19.913 --> 02:21.872
he could've sorted
this bullshit out,

02:21.873 --> 02:23.432
but you had to make a big drama!

02:23.433 --> 02:25.952
I won't let you bury me.
I'm staying right here.

02:25.953 --> 02:28.272
You're such a whiney little bitch!

02:28.273 --> 02:30.192
You hate me, you hate yourself.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.752
Nobody loves themselves more than I
do. I'd fuck myself in a heartbeat.

02:33.753 --> 02:37.752
So we're back to the whole
"I'm gay" thing there, aren't we?

02:38.233 --> 02:39.832
Why bring that up? I'm not gay.

02:39.833 --> 02:43.232
Remember that time in PE?
In the showers, you got turned on

02:43.233 --> 02:45.432
watching Richard Saunders
soap his balls?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.152
Oh, he's pathetic! He's sad.

02:47.153 --> 02:49.712
You thought about it
when screwing the fake vagina

02:49.713 --> 02:53.712
you made out of Mum's rubber gloves.

02:59.473 --> 03:00.832
You trying to fuck me?

03:00.833 --> 03:03.072
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

03:03.073 --> 03:04.232
I am you!

03:04.233 --> 03:08.232
You're nothing to do with me!

03:08.633 --> 03:12.632
Rudy!

03:20.953 --> 03:22.832
(GROANS)

03:22.833 --> 03:26.752
That could've gone
horribly wrong, that.

03:26.753 --> 03:30.752
You could have killed us.

03:32.273 --> 03:36.272
Shut up whining.

03:38.713 --> 03:40.832
C'mon.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.112
Get in here.

03:42.113 --> 03:45.192
Whoa!

03:45.193 --> 03:49.192

05:57.753 --> 06:01.752
WHISTLING

06:26.993 --> 06:30.992
(GROANS)

06:31.793 --> 06:35.272
Argh.

06:35.273 --> 06:37.032
You're not going to ask
about me limp?

06:37.033 --> 06:38.752
No.

06:38.753 --> 06:42.152
No, of course not!
Cos that would be doing your job.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.752
I'm not sure you're cut out
to be a probation worker.

06:44.753 --> 06:45.592
Is that right?

06:45.593 --> 06:46.632
Yeah.

06:46.633 --> 06:49.712
If you're finished
with the careers advice,

06:49.713 --> 06:53.712
piss off and pick up some litter
with the other shitheads.

06:59.433 --> 07:00.512
Right.

07:00.513 --> 07:04.512
Before all the accusations,

07:05.313 --> 07:07.472
recriminations start flying around,

07:07.473 --> 07:10.032
before harmony turns to discord,

07:10.033 --> 07:13.952
and everyone starts shouting,
jabbing their fingers at each other,

07:13.953 --> 07:16.552
I just want to say for the record,
hand on heart,

07:16.553 --> 07:19.592
the other hand on a Bible,

07:19.593 --> 07:22.312
that it wasn't absolutely wasn't me

07:22.313 --> 07:26.312
who left the big floater
in the toilet back there.

07:37.953 --> 07:41.952
These are the designs for an
intercontinental ballistic missile.

07:42.353 --> 07:43.592
Yeah, mate.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.432
Check out the propulsion system.

07:45.433 --> 07:48.552
It's liquid nitrogen. It's wicked.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.792
Where did you get them?

07:50.793 --> 07:52.232
I drew them.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.632
(LAUGHS)
You?

07:54.633 --> 07:58.072
You honestly expect me
to believe that?

07:58.073 --> 07:59.312
You think I nicked them?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.392
I fucking drew them.
They're my designs!

08:01.393 --> 08:04.392
Get her out of here.

08:04.393 --> 08:06.792
Take your hand off me, you prick!

08:06.793 --> 08:10.072
I'm a fucking rocket scientist!

LIFT DOOR OPENS

08:46.153 --> 08:49.592
These new powers are bullshit.

08:49.593 --> 08:52.112
I thought this power would make me
dead clever,

08:52.113 --> 08:54.072
but all I know is
how to design rockets.

08:54.073 --> 08:55.072
Guess it does what it says
on the tin.

08:55.073 --> 08:57.192
Only there's no tin

08:57.193 --> 09:00.832
or instructions. No-one believes
someone like me's a rocket scientist.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.512
You don't exactly look
like a rocket scientist.

09:03.513 --> 09:05.752
Maybe I should get some glasses,
to look dead intelligent.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.872
Yeah, that'll do it.

09:07.873 --> 09:11.392
Simon?

09:11.393 --> 09:15.392
Hey.

09:17.033 --> 09:18.872
Hurry up and put some clothes on.

09:18.873 --> 09:22.872

He's in Vegas

09:37.593 --> 09:39.632
They want us to go over

Talking to me?

10:02.833 --> 10:05.872
I believe so. It's French.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.592
You're not a fan of the French?

10:07.593 --> 10:08.792
Fair enough.

10:08.793 --> 10:12.792
I don't like the cunts either. Can I
have three pints of lager, please?

10:16.913 --> 10:18.792
What's wrong?

10:18.793 --> 10:19.992

10:23.353 --> 10:26.072
Later.

10:26.073 --> 10:27.912
I'm away for a cigarette.

10:27.913 --> 10:29.832
Good for you.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.952
I just want you to know, right,

10:32.953 --> 10:36.072
out of the two of you,
I like you the best.

10:36.073 --> 10:37.512
I mean, she's all right.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.112
She's not ugly or anything.

10:39.113 --> 10:40.872
Maybe a six or seven out of ten.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.232
So what am I?

10:43.233 --> 10:45.952
I would never disrespect you
like that, or any woman,

10:45.953 --> 10:47.632
but if I absolutely had to,

10:47.633 --> 10:49.952
I'd give you a nine.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.392
So, mathematically,

10:51.393 --> 10:55.392
as the two most... attractive members
of our Community Service gang,

10:55.593 --> 10:58.512
I believe we are genetically
predisposed to copulate.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.192
Any reputable scientist
would tell you that, love.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.632
Well, I'm obviously
incredibly flattered...

11:03.633 --> 11:05.672
Thank you.

11:05.673 --> 11:08.832
It's just, I don't find you
even remotely attractive.

11:08.833 --> 11:09.992
I don't believe you.

11:09.993 --> 11:11.592
Why would I lie?

11:11.593 --> 11:12.712
I don't know. Why would you lie?

11:12.713 --> 11:13.952
I'm not.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.472
Not consciously,

11:15.473 --> 11:19.472
just subconsciously, you're fucking
crazy about me. Aren't you?

11:19.833 --> 11:23.832
To be continued.

11:24.233 --> 11:28.232
Thank you.

11:28.473 --> 11:30.992
She just totally knocked you back.

11:30.993 --> 11:33.032
She's playing hard to get, mate.

11:33.033 --> 11:36.112
She's out of your league.
She's laughing her arse off at you.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.192
You can't go back in there.

11:39.193 --> 11:40.472
You're gonna have to...

11:40.473 --> 11:44.472
Oh, climb through the window!
Just go. C'mon.

11:44.553 --> 11:47.232
No! You'd love that, wouldn't you?

11:47.233 --> 11:48.432
Why don't I just go home

11:48.433 --> 11:52.432
and spend the rest of the night
torturing myself about things I did
when I was like 14?

11:52.873 --> 11:55.112
You mean the thing
with the neighbour's cat?

11:55.113 --> 11:56.712
No!

11:56.713 --> 12:00.712
We do not talk about that! Right?

12:00.953 --> 12:02.272
Where are you going?

12:02.273 --> 12:04.512
Just fuck the fuck off.

12:04.513 --> 12:05.872
Wait for me outside.

12:05.873 --> 12:09.872
Honestly, you're a miserable prick.

12:15.753 --> 12:19.752
So...

12:21.393 --> 12:24.232
I believe you were just saying
how you, uh,

12:24.233 --> 12:27.192
wanted to have sex with me?

12:27.193 --> 12:31.192
What's that all about?

12:31.433 --> 12:35.432
Oh!
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

12:36.113 --> 12:39.672
Oh, no, ta, you're all right.

12:39.673 --> 12:43.392
I'm genetically predisposed
to get cancer.

12:43.393 --> 12:44.792
I think I'll pass.

12:44.793 --> 12:46.552
If you don't smoke,
why are you out here?

12:46.553 --> 12:48.592
I'm sick of all the wankers in there

12:48.593 --> 12:50.672
acting like they're
having a good time.

12:50.673 --> 12:53.192
So how come you're on
Community Service?

12:53.193 --> 12:54.712
What've you done?

12:54.713 --> 12:57.992
Oh, c'mon, what's your crime?

12:57.993 --> 13:01.312
I was with my boyfriend,
and we got stopped by the police.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.712
He put the drugs he was carrying
in my bag.

13:03.713 --> 13:06.152
I saw him, but I didn't
have time to do anything.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.512
You're kidding.

13:07.513 --> 13:11.272
No-one's ever going to do
anything like that to me again.

13:11.273 --> 13:15.272
People will shit all over you
any chance they get, won't they?

13:17.593 --> 13:19.792
I had you all wrong.

13:19.793 --> 13:20.832
I thought you were
a shallow little prick.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.712
No, it's an act. It's a front.

13:23.713 --> 13:27.712
I'm deeply insecure.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.032
Do you want to...

13:31.033 --> 13:33.552
go somewhere, just us?

13:33.553 --> 13:37.552
Let's stay here. We're just getting
to know each other, aren't we?

13:38.513 --> 13:42.512
We'll talk in there.

Thank you.

16:35.833 --> 16:39.352
You've just had unprotected
anal sex with that girl.

16:39.353 --> 16:41.592
I most certainly did.
And she loved it.

16:41.593 --> 16:42.792
What if she's got HIV?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.672
Cute girls don't get HIV.

16:45.673 --> 16:48.592
You need to take her to a clinic,
get her to have some tests,

16:48.593 --> 16:50.072
get her a full work-up.

16:50.073 --> 16:51.512
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

16:51.513 --> 16:54.072
Do you know
how rare it is to find a girl

16:54.073 --> 16:57.672
who genuinely, honest to God,
absolutely loves it up the arse?

16:57.673 --> 17:01.232
Urgh.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.512
Can you smell that?

17:03.513 --> 17:06.352
That's bacon, gently sizzling
in the pan there.

17:06.353 --> 17:08.632
Life doesn't get any better
than this for me!

17:08.633 --> 17:10.992
It's as close to heaven
as I'm gonna get.

17:10.992 --> 17:14.791
If you don't get her
to have those tests, I will.

17:14.792 --> 17:18.472
Don't go near her, do you hear me?
She doesn't need to see this shit.

17:18.473 --> 17:22.232
I think she does. In fact, I'll go
tell her to stick some more bacon
on,

17:22.233 --> 17:25.592
cos that's three for breakfast.

17:25.593 --> 17:27.512
You have totally crossed the line!

17:28.753 --> 17:29.952
Rudy? Are you OK?

17:29.953 --> 17:33.032
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just
washing shit off me cock.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.912
I'm going to tell her everything.

17:34.913 --> 17:38.912
All your embarrassing
little secrets.

17:39.313 --> 17:41.232
Who are you talking to?

17:41.233 --> 17:43.752
No-one! Meself.

17:43.753 --> 17:45.232
What're you doing in there?

17:45.233 --> 17:49.232
Nothing.

17:51.873 --> 17:53.352
Rudy!

17:53.353 --> 17:56.872
Just a minute! Just a minute, yeah?

17:56.873 --> 17:58.552
Ow!

17:58.553 --> 18:02.232
Fuck!

18:02.233 --> 18:05.312
What happened?

18:05.313 --> 18:09.032
Funny thing. You know how I said
I was washing me cock?

18:09.033 --> 18:12.512
I slipped on the soap
and impaled meself on some scissors!

18:12.513 --> 18:15.352
How mad's that shit?

18:15.353 --> 18:19.352
Actually really fucking hurts, like.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.512
So is this like brunch?

18:24.513 --> 18:28.192
Cos it feels like I'm just
eating a bacon sandwich?

18:28.193 --> 18:32.192
Hey. That's him. That's the guy
who said I bottled him.

18:34.033 --> 18:35.552
What are you smiling at?

18:35.553 --> 18:36.872
A gentleman never tells.

18:36.873 --> 18:39.712
I've just fucked her up the arse!

18:39.713 --> 18:43.472
Everything you said?
It was all bullshit!

18:43.473 --> 18:44.512
How could you do that to me?

18:44.513 --> 18:48.512
But I didn't do it to you...
I did it to her.

18:48.513 --> 18:52.512
I'm the arse man.
King of the world!

18:53.273 --> 18:57.272
What's she done to him?

(GROANS)

19:07.273 --> 19:09.432
Are you all right?

19:09.433 --> 19:11.072
You're that crazy barman
who bottled me.

19:11.073 --> 19:12.592
I didn't bottle you.

19:12.593 --> 19:13.752
It must have been her.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.752
Why would she do that?

Sorry, I...

20:07.953 --> 20:11.592
thought you were someone else.

20:11.593 --> 20:14.992
Did you see a guy run down here?

20:14.993 --> 20:18.992
I haven't seen anyone.

20:31.473 --> 20:34.752
Sweet.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.552
I thought they had you.

20:43.553 --> 20:47.552
No. I got away. I...

20:48.273 --> 20:50.152
I did my thing.

20:50.153 --> 20:54.152
Ah! If that's some vague reference
to all this "power" bullshit,

20:56.473 --> 21:00.472
then don't worry, cos I am
cool and the gang with all that.

21:03.953 --> 21:07.952
You're very starey.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.112
Ah, hey!

21:13.113 --> 21:15.712
Whoa, this is cool.

21:15.713 --> 21:19.712
Loving that lift. Look at this lift!

21:20.953 --> 21:24.952
(LAUGHS)
Brilliant.

21:27.673 --> 21:29.472
So this turning into a girl thing,

21:29.473 --> 21:32.352
is it born out of
some sort of sexual confusion?

21:32.353 --> 21:35.552
There ain't no sexual confusion.

21:35.553 --> 21:36.712
If you say so.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.072
They all got their powers before me!
It was all they had left.

21:39.073 --> 21:42.392
He's a bit touchy, ain't he?

21:42.393 --> 21:45.112
So this girl he turns into...

21:45.113 --> 21:47.672
Would you?

21:47.673 --> 21:49.032
You know?

21:49.033 --> 21:50.592
Would you... fuck her?

21:50.593 --> 21:52.152
We've never seen her.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.912
Oh.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.512
Oh.

21:56.513 --> 21:58.312
I've always wanted me own vagina.

21:58.313 --> 22:01.632
Not to keep. Cos I've heard
they require a lot of maintenance.

22:01.633 --> 22:04.112
Upkeep, like cleaning, polishing,

22:04.113 --> 22:08.112

22:30.233 --> 22:34.232
We went to the same college.

Why's he here?

23:03.313 --> 23:05.272
What's going on?

23:05.273 --> 23:07.112
We were brunching.

23:07.113 --> 23:11.112
And then it just kicked off.

23:38.873 --> 23:42.872
It's her.

23:54.193 --> 23:56.712
Look at it.

23:56.713 --> 24:00.712
Look at it!

to be floating out there somewhere.

There's this girl on the estate.

24:34.593 --> 24:37.352
She used a power to make it look
like we trashed a car.

24:37.353 --> 24:38.352
The police are after us.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.152
And you're telling me because...?

24:41.153 --> 24:44.272
I thought you could do something.
Take her power or something.

24:44.273 --> 24:45.512
Oh, did you?

24:45.513 --> 24:48.312
I'll just find my cape and tights
and get on it.

24:48.313 --> 24:50.672

D'you see me laughing?

24:50.673 --> 24:52.312

shit-eating grin on your face.

25:01.273 --> 25:05.272
Look, are you going to do something
about this girl or not?

25:06.553 --> 25:08.792
I really don't see that happening.

25:08.793 --> 25:11.192
You don't give a shit about anyone,
do you?

25:11.193 --> 25:15.192
I give a shit about me.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.832
And just so you know,
this new power?

25:17.833 --> 25:19.032
It's rubbish.

25:19.033 --> 25:20.552
But you're a rocket scientist.

25:20.553 --> 25:24.432
Yeah, and you're a dick!

took the dog?

25:49.953 --> 25:51.192
What dog? Was there even a dog?

25:51.193 --> 25:53.512
The charity box, for the blind?

25:53.513 --> 25:56.752
The Labrador, Retriever, whatever
the fuck it was. Who nicked it?

25:56.753 --> 25:59.232
What? I don't know nothing
about no dog, man.

25:59.233 --> 26:03.232
Was there a dog?
Where is there a dog?

26:03.753 --> 26:06.992
Who took it?

26:06.993 --> 26:08.872
Right.

26:08.873 --> 26:10.512
I really hate to be a grass,

26:10.513 --> 26:13.672
but I did see
that strangely intense girl

26:13.673 --> 26:17.112
with slightly inadequate breasts -
she was carrying something heavy

26:17.113 --> 26:19.712
and dog-shaped
over to her locker before...

26:19.713 --> 26:20.872
Which one?

26:20.873 --> 26:24.872
It's number 43.

26:26.313 --> 26:30.312
Ow.

26:46.233 --> 26:47.552
Hey.

26:47.553 --> 26:51.552
Come here. Mm, come here.

26:53.233 --> 26:56.912
The probation worker's
looking for you.

26:56.913 --> 26:58.032
And why's that?

26:58.033 --> 27:00.232
Because he seems to be
under the impression

27:00.233 --> 27:02.512
that you've stolen
a dog-shaped charity box,

27:02.513 --> 27:05.112
on account of him having
found it in your locker.

27:05.113 --> 27:06.512
Mm!

27:06.513 --> 27:09.872
You fuck with me, I'll fuck you
right back with a cherry on top.

27:09.873 --> 27:12.472
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

27:12.473 --> 27:15.872
You think you can use
your little power to fi...

27:15.873 --> 27:17.112
..ix this.

27:17.113 --> 27:20.472
You're too late,
because he's already reported you.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.952
And the cops are already coming.

what she did to you,

or you'll never get over it.
You have to confront her.

Why d'you need to dig this shit up?
It's old news. I'm over it!

28:17.593 --> 28:19.792
You think about her all the time.

28:19.793 --> 28:23.512
No. You think about her.

28:23.513 --> 28:25.552
It's the same thing.

28:25.553 --> 28:29.072
You know what?
I think about loads of things.

28:29.073 --> 28:31.552
I think about shagging supermodels.

28:31.553 --> 28:33.552
I think about shagging
normal models.

28:33.553 --> 28:37.112
I think about how sad it is
that the polar bears are drowning

28:37.113 --> 28:39.632
because all the ice is melting.

28:39.633 --> 28:42.512
That doesn't mean I have
to do anything about it, though.

Now, c'mon. Get in here.

and anuses to violate.

29:03.753 --> 29:06.192
Is he fingering her?

29:06.193 --> 29:09.192
I think he might be.

29:09.193 --> 29:13.192
I'll get them in, hm?

29:23.193 --> 29:27.192
That's thirsty work, that.

29:35.073 --> 29:39.072
I'm with that beautiful,
innocent-looking girl down there.

29:39.073 --> 29:42.432
She absolutely loves it up the arse!

29:42.433 --> 29:45.432
I know! We're all pussying around,
aren't we?

29:45.433 --> 29:46.872
"Should I slip it up there?"

29:46.873 --> 29:50.792
"You can't. That's where she
makes her toilet." Turns out...

29:50.793 --> 29:52.832

to a woman's heart.

how I feel about you,

I can't believe there's two of you!

It's like he came out of
inside of you!

30:38.393 --> 30:40.432
What?

30:40.433 --> 30:41.672
You know what you did.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.552
What did she do?

30:43.553 --> 30:45.512
Let's just go. Come on! Let's go.
Wagons, roll!

30:45.513 --> 30:47.592
We had sex together.

30:47.593 --> 30:48.952
You had sex with her?

30:48.953 --> 30:52.952
Not recently. I don't even
remember it. So many fannies, right?

30:53.073 --> 30:55.032
Big ones. Small ones. Hairy ones.

30:55.033 --> 30:58.672
Floppy, great, big, flappy fannies...
(BARKS LIKE A SEAL)

30:58.673 --> 31:01.312
We were at a party.

31:01.313 --> 31:03.952
I'd fancied you for two years.

31:03.953 --> 31:07.952
She took my virginity. It was
the happiest moment of my life.

31:07.993 --> 31:11.152
For me, it was getting a handjob
on the Vortex at Thorpe Park.

31:11.153 --> 31:13.132
Can we just go?

31:13.193 --> 31:15.952
I told all my friends
I was seeing you, you know.

31:15.953 --> 31:19.192
The next day,
you looked right through me.

31:19.193 --> 31:22.392
I loved you,
and you wouldn't even look at me.

31:22.393 --> 31:24.152
This is piss under the bridge.

31:24.153 --> 31:26.232
I had to watch you going
with all them other boys.

31:26.233 --> 31:28.512
Why are you doing this?

31:28.513 --> 31:30.352
It's drugs. He's on drugs.

31:30.353 --> 31:33.432
Do you know
what they used to call you?

31:33.433 --> 31:35.072
The Co... The Cockmonster.

31:35.073 --> 31:36.792
Just leave it, yeah? Just fuck off.

31:36.793 --> 31:39.072
Why did they call you
The Cockmonster?

31:39.073 --> 31:40.352
You have to ask?

31:40.353 --> 31:41.672
I tried to kill myself!

31:41.673 --> 31:43.992
Oi! You shut your fucking mouth!

31:43.993 --> 31:45.552
I wanted to die because of you.

31:45.553 --> 31:46.912
Ohh...

31:46.913 --> 31:50.912
It's not my fault you're so messed
up that you tried to kill yourself.

31:52.193 --> 31:55.592
Fuck you, and your sad little
fantasies! This is bullshit!

31:55.593 --> 31:59.592
You're denying it happened...
you're doing it again.

32:06.873 --> 32:12.272
Last orders.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.612
I'm not that person any more.

32:24.613 --> 32:27.132
I know.

32:27.133 --> 32:29.012
I never wanted you to hear
those things about me...

32:29.013 --> 32:31.092
It doesn't matter...

32:31.093 --> 32:33.132
It doesn't matter that
your girlfriend

32:33.133 --> 32:37.132
used to be called
"the cock-monster"?

32:37.613 --> 32:41.612
We've all got a past.
I've got two pasts.

32:43.653 --> 32:47.652
All that matters is us, here... now.

32:55.893 --> 32:59.892
Do you know what they used
to call me at school...?

33:02.573 --> 33:06.252
The pussy meister.

33:06.253 --> 33:07.452
Shut up!

33:07.453 --> 33:11.172
I was getting so much pussy,
I didn't know what to do with it.

33:11.173 --> 33:14.292
Just loads of pussy, everywhere...

33:14.293 --> 33:18.292
Will you stop saying "pussy"?!

33:25.693 --> 33:29.692
TV ON QUIETLY

33:44.573 --> 33:48.572
(SIGHS)

33:53.773 --> 33:56.852
How have you got in here...?

33:56.853 --> 33:58.012
Broke a window.

33:58.013 --> 33:59.532
(TUTS)

33:59.533 --> 34:01.852
(TUTS)

34:01.853 --> 34:05.852
D'you know, this isn't working out
for either of us.

34:07.733 --> 34:11.292
I think we should stay split.

34:11.293 --> 34:13.411
Per-Permanently...?

34:13.413 --> 34:15.732
Why not? You've had
your moment in the sun.

34:15.733 --> 34:19.732
You've got it all off your chest.
Consider me humiliated.

34:22.813 --> 34:26.732
You're your own man now. We can go
our separate ways. Separate lives.

34:26.733 --> 34:30.732
We don't need to see each other
ever again. What d'you say?

34:33.933 --> 34:35.612
You could move to Wales,

34:35.612 --> 34:37.851
I've no fucking intention
of going there!

34:37.853 --> 34:40.532
So you can walk around like
you're happy all the time?

34:40.533 --> 34:41.891
It works for me.

34:41.893 --> 34:45.612
I don't need you turning up
every time I feel down,

34:45.612 --> 34:48.292
reminding me of everything that
makes me feel shit about myself.

34:48.293 --> 34:50.371
But it's a part of who you are...

34:50.373 --> 34:54.371
No. It's a part of who you are.
All this fighting, arguing.

34:55.013 --> 34:58.332
Nobody wants to get stabbed in the
shoulder with a pair of scissors.

34:58.333 --> 35:02.332
It's not cool, and it hurts.

35:03.293 --> 35:07.292
C'mon, man.
Let's just stay split.

35:15.813 --> 35:19.812
I'm going to take
your moody silence as a "yes".

35:19.853 --> 35:23.852
Try not to break another window
on your way out.

36:47.533 --> 36:48.612
Jesus!

36:48.613 --> 36:52.172
I thought you were
at the police station...?

36:52.173 --> 36:53.492
The police are going to have

36:53.493 --> 36:57.492
a lot more important things to do
than look for me.

37:34.933 --> 37:38.932
Oh, Jesus.

37:39.893 --> 37:43.892
It wasn't me...

37:47.253 --> 37:50.052
What did you do...?

37:50.053 --> 37:54.052
I didn't do anything.

38:32.493 --> 38:33.572
Oh!

38:33.573 --> 38:37.572
Jesus! Shit!

38:39.773 --> 38:41.012
Well, this isn't good, is it?

38:41.013 --> 38:43.332
Why's she doing this?

38:43.333 --> 38:45.612
I honestly have no idea.

38:45.613 --> 38:47.932
I'll find out where she is.

38:47.933 --> 38:50.772
Oh, brilliant. We'll just untie
your hands, slip off the noose,

38:50.773 --> 38:51.852
and away you go.

38:51.853 --> 38:55.612
No... my power! I can put myself
in other people's shoes.

38:55.613 --> 38:57.412
See what they see
through their eyes.

38:57.413 --> 38:59.812
Do you have to be
wearing their shoes?

38:59.813 --> 39:03.812
No. Right. That'd be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

39:14.333 --> 39:15.292
She's writing our suicide notes!

39:15.293 --> 39:19.292
Fuck...

39:22.533 --> 39:24.252
You don't have to do this!

39:24.253 --> 39:27.332
Well, someone's going to get
blamed for stabbing Charlie.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.332
And it's not going to be me.

39:29.333 --> 39:33.212
What if we promise
not to tell anyone...?

39:33.213 --> 39:36.492
But... if this is suicide,

39:36.493 --> 39:40.212
how d'you explain our hands
being tied behind our backs?

39:40.213 --> 39:42.692
I'll untie them when you're dead.

39:42.693 --> 39:45.452
Hm. I'm glad you've
thought of everything.

39:45.453 --> 39:49.452
Or should I say,
nearly everything?

39:49.973 --> 39:51.372
No, you're bluffing.

39:51.373 --> 39:52.532
Am I?

39:52.533 --> 39:53.892
Yeah!

39:53.893 --> 39:55.972
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you. It's up to you.

39:55.973 --> 39:58.652
Ooh, the irony.

39:58.653 --> 40:01.492
You're gonna kick yourself.

40:01.493 --> 40:03.372
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:03.373 --> 40:04.492
It's hilarious. It's too funny.

40:04.493 --> 40:07.612
What is it?

40:07.613 --> 40:08.652
Tell me!

40:08.653 --> 40:12.652
All right. It's this...

40:17.653 --> 40:19.412
Rudy!

40:19.413 --> 40:20.532
Wrap your legs round me.

40:20.533 --> 40:23.892
I'll take your weight! Wrap
your legs around me! Come on!

40:23.893 --> 40:26.132
I didn't mean to kill her!

40:26.133 --> 40:27.332
You can't hold us...

40:27.333 --> 40:30.372
Just hold on.

40:30.373 --> 40:32.492
No point in us both dying.

40:32.493 --> 40:34.772
Just hold on!

40:34.773 --> 40:36.252
You broke my heart...

40:36.253 --> 40:37.812
I know.

40:37.813 --> 40:40.212
I lied.

40:40.213 --> 40:42.892
I do remember you.

40:42.893 --> 40:46.292
I was a bitch. I didn't care
who I hurt, but I've changed.

40:46.293 --> 40:50.212
I'm not that person any more!

40:50.213 --> 40:53.572
I hate myself for
what I did to you.

40:53.573 --> 40:54.692
I'm sorry.

40:54.693 --> 40:58.052
That's good enough.

40:58.053 --> 41:00.572
No! Rudy!

41:00.573 --> 41:03.532
Rudy! Help!

41:03.533 --> 41:05.492
Somebody help us...!

41:05.493 --> 41:09.492
SCREAMS FADE

41:34.893 --> 41:38.892
I thought you'd gone to Wales?

41:46.053 --> 41:49.452
I've got to tell you, guys...
I'm kind of freaking out here,

41:49.453 --> 41:52.772
all this killing
and burying and dying.

41:52.773 --> 41:55.132
Just, I'm outside
my comfort zone.

41:55.133 --> 41:59.132
If it makes you feel any better,
we've done a couple of people too.

42:00.213 --> 42:02.252
Shit just happened.

42:02.253 --> 42:05.732
You bury 'em,
just get on with your life.

42:05.733 --> 42:09.732
I just... keep seeing this image
of her cute little face,

42:10.853 --> 42:14.852
she's biting down
on the mattress, there.

42:15.573 --> 42:19.572
She absolutely loved it
up the arse.

42:19.573 --> 42:23.572
God rest her beautiful soul.

42:23.773 --> 42:27.772
Amen.

42:40.653 --> 42:44.412
Well, that could've
gone a lot worse, you know?

42:44.413 --> 42:47.092
For me.

42:47.093 --> 42:48.372
A new day tomorrow.

42:48.373 --> 42:50.732
Who knows what it holds
for all of us.

42:50.733 --> 42:52.812
SIREN WAILS

42:52.813 --> 42:53.852
Shit...

42:53.853 --> 42:54.732
Just stay cool.

42:54.733 --> 42:57.652
Don't get upset,
but this isn't exactly my car.

42:57.653 --> 42:58.372
Whose car is it?

42:58.373 --> 42:59.772
Nicked it off a man with a perm.

42:59.773 --> 43:02.852
A man, with a perm.
What's that about?

43:02.853 --> 43:06.052
We can't get caught in no nicked
car. We're all on probation.

43:06.053 --> 43:10.052
Maybe they'll let you off
with a warning, love.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.412
Honestly, guys...

43:13.413 --> 43:16.892
I thought they'd let you off
with a warning.

43:16.893 --> 43:20.892
SLOW HANDCLAP

43:26.293 --> 43:30.172
That didn't take you long,
did it? Congratulations.

43:30.173 --> 43:32.692
You haven't changed.

43:32.693 --> 43:36.692
That's where you're wrong, because
I've found a new dedication

43:37.213 --> 43:41.212
to ensuring your complete
and total rehabilitation.

43:43.533 --> 43:46.492
I'll get started, right after I've
watched Homes Under the Hammer.

43:46.493 --> 43:50.492
Ooh! Can we watch that
with you?

43:50.573 --> 43:54.172
You lot can piss off
and do some work.

43:54.173 --> 43:58.172
Chop chop.

44:28.813 --> 44:29.812
What you doing?

44:29.813 --> 44:31.732
Designing a new
propulsion system.

44:31.733 --> 44:32.732
Why?

44:32.733 --> 44:35.492
Because I'm a fucking
rocket scientist.

44:35.493 --> 44:38.692
Ah, are we doing catchphrases?

44:38.693 --> 44:42.692
Maybe we could all have one.
Mine could be, "Now you see me,

44:42.813 --> 44:44.412
"Now you see two of me".

44:44.413 --> 44:45.892
Why do we need catchphrases?

44:45.893 --> 44:49.892
You know... for when
shit goes down, man.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.972
C'mon. D'you really think we're
going to spend the next seven weeks

44:53.973 --> 44:55.732
ambling around,
picking up litter?

44:55.733 --> 44:56.732
He's got a point.

44:56.733 --> 44:59.532
Maybe it'll be different
this time.

44:59.533 --> 45:02.172
Maybe there won't be
any shit going down.

45:02.173 --> 45:04.972
Oh, trust me.
There'll be shit.

45:04.973 --> 45:08.972
It's in the air.

45:09.173 --> 45:13.172
I can smell it.

45:25.813 --> 45:27.852
So do you want to tell me
what's going on?

45:27.853 --> 45:30.572
Why are we following him?
Oh, my God.

45:30.573 --> 45:31.932
You fancy him!

45:31.933 --> 45:34.372
You're Curtis Donovan,
aren't you?

45:34.373 --> 45:35.292
So what is there to do
round here?

45:35.293 --> 45:36.532
Have you just had a shag?

45:36.533 --> 45:37.772
Something like that.

45:37.773 --> 45:39.572
Who's the lucky girl?

45:39.573 --> 45:40.892
You don't know her.

45:40.893 --> 45:42.932
This was the worst sex
I have ever had.

45:42.933 --> 45:45.892
When we were together,
was I...?

45:45.893 --> 45:47.412
What? Was I shit?

45:47.413 --> 45:49.972
What are you doing?
That's Curtis's locker.

45:49.973 --> 45:52.092
It's me, Curtis.

45:52.093 --> 45:53.955
This is how I look
when I'm a girl.
