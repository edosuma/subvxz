NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.828 --> 00:06.709
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.766 --> 00:08.609
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.668 --> 00:11.478
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.537 --> 00:13.278
These are their stories.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.344
Honey, your leashing
is too slack. Shorten up.

00:17.410 --> 00:20.482
I said shorten, Ryan.
That's better.

00:20.546 --> 00:22.890
Never had any complaints
about my leashing before.

00:22.982 --> 00:26.327
(CHUCKLING) Don't worry. I'm a master
at teaching old dogs new tricks.

00:26.385 --> 00:27.420
(DOG BARKING)

00:27.487 --> 00:28.864
(GASPING) Oh, my God!

00:30.423 --> 00:34.166
Decedent is a female, blond, early
30s, name of Karin Burdett.

00:34.227 --> 00:36.366
Looks like she fell, or
jumped from the building.

00:36.429 --> 00:38.306
Her place on the 18th
floor has a balcony.

00:38.364 --> 00:39.843
Who ID'd her?
The doorman.

00:39.899 --> 00:42.140
Says her husband is president
of some drug company.

00:42.201 --> 00:43.202
Did he see her fall?

00:43.269 --> 00:44.270
He says he was on a break.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.975
CURTIS: Excuse me,
is Mr. Burdett around?

00:46.038 --> 00:48.951
I called upstairs right when it happened.
He wasn't in.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.351
What time was that?

00:50.409 --> 00:51.683
11:45 or so.

00:52.178 --> 00:55.785
He might have slipped back in while
I was on my break. I better check.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.158
You notice what time
he went out this morning?

00:58.217 --> 01:01.289
No, I must have missed it. I might
have been on a break then, too.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.834
Three breaks in one morning? You
must have one hell of a union.

01:03.890 --> 01:07.599
What I have is a prostate condition.
Oh, wait, there he is.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.198
Let him in,

01:09.262 --> 01:12.141
CURTIS: Mr. Burdett,
we're with the police.

01:12.465 --> 01:14.843
Yes, what's wrong?
What happened here?

01:14.901 --> 01:16.608
I'm afraid it's about
your wife, sir.

01:16.669 --> 01:20.481
My wife? I was just at the
pharmacy getting her prescription.

01:21.774 --> 01:23.253
Karin!
Take it easy, Mr. Burdett.

01:23.309 --> 01:24.811
There's nothing
you can do for her now.

01:24.877 --> 01:25.912
Take it easy.
All right.

01:25.978 --> 01:27.616
All right.
Sit over here.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.681
Come on.

01:28.748 --> 01:30.625
We got you.
You're gonna be okay.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.356
All right,
you just try to relax.

01:32.418 --> 01:36.230
We're gonna come back and talk
to you in a minute. All right?

01:37.356 --> 01:38.767
Guy is president
of a drug company,

01:38.824 --> 01:41.395
and he still has to schlepp to the
drugstore like the rest of us.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.940
What do you think she needed?
Happy pills?

01:43.996 --> 01:46.306
I hope he got some for himself.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

02:36.215 --> 02:40.595
It's Desyrel. An anti-depressant.
Karin had a bad night.

02:41.854 --> 02:44.460
What time did you
leave this morning?

02:45.191 --> 02:46.761
About 10:00.

02:46.826 --> 02:48.863
The pharmacy doesn't deliver?

02:48.928 --> 02:51.238
They said it would
take two hours.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.334
Was your wife
expecting anybody?

02:53.399 --> 02:55.709
No. She'd taken
some sleeping pills.

02:55.768 --> 02:58.681
She was groggy. She was in
no shape to see anyone.

02:59.872 --> 03:03.115
Mr. Burdett, did she ever
talk about suicide?

03:04.210 --> 03:05.245
No.

03:06.579 --> 03:08.581
Clemente, what have you got?

03:08.648 --> 03:10.389
Latent pulled some
nice prints off the door,

03:10.449 --> 03:12.019
and over here on the railing.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.030
This where she went off?
Uh-huh.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.101
Looks like she stumbled around,
knocked over these pots.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.533
CURTIS: Hey, Lennie.

03:18.858 --> 03:21.600
Well, we got sleeping pills,
broken flower pots...

03:21.660 --> 03:23.264
And we got this.

03:24.196 --> 03:25.334
Parlodel?

03:25.398 --> 03:26.900
It's used to stop lactation.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.209
So where's the baby?

03:29.301 --> 03:31.247
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
CURTIS: Mr. Burdett,

03:32.204 --> 03:35.777
these Parlodel for your wife. Do
you know why she was taking them?

03:35.841 --> 03:36.911
(SIGHING)

03:37.410 --> 03:39.549
She gave birth to a girl
three weeks ago.

03:41.147 --> 03:42.558
Is the baby staying
with someone else?

03:42.615 --> 03:44.219
We gave it up for adoption.

03:45.451 --> 03:48.364
Well, how did Mrs. Burdett
feel about that?

03:50.890 --> 03:51.891
(SIGHING)

03:52.391 --> 03:54.166
It was understood
when we were married

03:54.226 --> 03:56.467
I didn't want
any more children.

03:57.096 --> 03:59.508
I have a teenage son
by my first marriage.

03:59.565 --> 04:02.637
When Karin got pregnant,
we discussed it again.

04:03.436 --> 04:06.576
In the end it just
didn't make sense.

04:08.641 --> 04:12.487
She had two partially digested
Halcion tablets in her stomach.

04:13.012 --> 04:14.457
She was feeling pretty good.

04:14.513 --> 04:16.220
Good enough to make
it over a railing?

04:16.281 --> 04:18.387
She might have managed it.

04:18.451 --> 04:20.055
You said she was
taking Parlodel?

04:20.119 --> 04:21.325
That's right.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.890
The panel didn't pick
up any in her blood.

04:23.956 --> 04:25.936
She hadn't taken it
for at least three days.

04:25.991 --> 04:28.096
It takes that long
to clear the system.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.800
So she stopped taking them. Maybe
they were upsetting her stomach.

04:30.863 --> 04:33.935
Or she was getting ready
to take the baby back.

04:34.533 --> 04:35.534
What's that?

04:35.601 --> 04:38.548
You're jumping ahead.
It's an abraded contusion.

04:38.604 --> 04:39.776
Back of her right wrist.

04:39.839 --> 04:40.840
From the fall?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.079
From having her arm
twisted, hard.

04:45.644 --> 04:47.555
He's fifty-seven
years old, Lennie.

04:47.613 --> 04:49.889
How would you like to
do diaper duty again?

04:49.949 --> 04:51.986
Yeah, if that happened to me,
I'd jump off the roof.

04:52.051 --> 04:54.930
Look, she would have fought back.
There'd be marks on him.

04:54.987 --> 04:56.489
She was too doped up to fight.

04:56.555 --> 04:58.125
You talk to Burdett's pharmacy?

04:58.190 --> 05:00.796
They remember he was there, but they
don't know when or for how long.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.170
Still, it's a ten minute trip
he says took him an hour.

05:03.229 --> 05:05.607
One vote she was pushed,
one vote she jumped.

05:05.664 --> 05:06.904
(PHONE RINGING)

05:08.067 --> 05:09.410
Van Buren.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.643
Could you hold on?

05:12.705 --> 05:14.548
See if forensics
can break the tie.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.416
And could you
close the door please?

05:20.813 --> 05:21.917
Boyfriend?

05:21.981 --> 05:23.051
Mrs. Van Buren?

05:23.115 --> 05:26.460
No. I heard she took the Captain's exam.
Usually means a transfer.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.989
Just when I was getting used
to her sunny disposition.

05:30.389 --> 05:31.561
CLEMENTE: We'll do
another drop,

05:31.624 --> 05:33.661
but so far we keep getting
the same results.

05:33.726 --> 05:36.229
If we just drop the dummy,
it lands in the water,

05:36.295 --> 05:38.434
56 inches short of where
your victim landed.

05:38.497 --> 05:40.738
CURTIS: What if she had pushed
off the rail when she jumped?

05:40.800 --> 05:43.337
Gets her maybe a foot
closer to the target.

05:43.402 --> 05:45.780
She needed a nice big shove
to land where she did.

05:45.838 --> 05:48.079
So much for
May-December romances.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.414
It's enough to make me a cynic.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.386
You know, Lennie, Karin
Burdett's obstetrician

05:51.443 --> 05:53.548
was the one who prescribed
the anti-depressant.

05:53.612 --> 05:56.491
She must have gotten an
earful about the adoption.

05:59.885 --> 06:03.162
I spent a grand on a malpractice
seminar in CuraÃ§ao.

06:03.622 --> 06:05.431
Besides finding out
I'm too old for Mai Tais,

06:05.491 --> 06:07.266
I learned never to
talk out of school.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.669
Your patient is dead,
Dr. Frieder.

06:08.727 --> 06:10.638
I doubt she'd mind if you
violate her privilege.

06:10.696 --> 06:11.766
Her estate might.

06:11.831 --> 06:13.401
You mean her husband?

06:13.465 --> 06:14.876
He's the murder suspect.

06:15.734 --> 06:17.805
BRISCOE: Well, if it makes
you feel any better, Doc,

06:17.870 --> 06:19.872
patient chit-chat
isn't privileged.

06:19.939 --> 06:22.442
That includes anything non-medical
she might have said to you

06:22.508 --> 06:24.454
about wanting to
revoke the adoption.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.923
She had been very ambivalent all
along about giving it away.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.517
She had 30 days after the
adoption to change her mind.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.654
I don't know if she
took any legal steps.

06:32.718 --> 06:34.561
Did she tell you how her
husband felt about it?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.497
No. But I don't think
he was very supportive.

06:36.555 --> 06:39.092
He didn't even show up
for the ultrasound.

06:39.158 --> 06:40.660
Too much going on at work.

06:40.726 --> 06:42.603
Do you know which adoption
agency they used?

06:42.661 --> 06:45.403
They went through a baby broker.
I don't know his name.

06:45.464 --> 06:48.138
Well, who did you hand the baby
off to after the delivery?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.440
I wasn't at the delivery.

06:49.501 --> 06:51.674
What, another
surf-and-sand seminar?

06:51.737 --> 06:55.583
I was right here. They were in
Trenton, New Jersey. At City Hospital.

06:57.643 --> 06:59.748
A public hospital?

06:59.812 --> 07:01.883
Sure, I remember the Burdetts.

07:01.947 --> 07:04.826
Our patients don't usually
pay with a platinum card.

07:04.884 --> 07:07.057
And a very close,
loving couple they were.

07:07.119 --> 07:10.157
While she was delivering the
baby, he's on a cell phone.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.724
Half an hour after
that baby's born,

07:11.790 --> 07:14.862
a lawyer shows up in a
limo and signs it out.

07:14.927 --> 07:18.306
So you'd have his name and
number in the Burdetts' file.

07:18.364 --> 07:21.811
Yes. That's where we keep
confidential information.

07:22.601 --> 07:26.048
Oh, come on. You show me his
number, and I'll show you mine.

07:26.105 --> 07:28.016
And I guarantee, you'll
have more fun with me

07:28.073 --> 07:29.416
than I'm gonna have with him.

07:29.475 --> 07:31.978
I don't think so, Romeo.

07:32.044 --> 07:35.753
Last week, a young woman came in here
wanting to get in touch with the Burdetts.

07:35.814 --> 07:37.487
Who was she?
I don't know,

07:37.549 --> 07:39.290
but she didn't get
anything out of me either.

07:39.351 --> 07:42.560
And she was a whole lot cuter than you.
Excuse me.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.096
I knew it.

07:46.158 --> 07:48.399
So what do you think?
The adoptive mother?

07:48.460 --> 07:50.497
Well, if she got word Karin
Burdett was making a move

07:50.562 --> 07:51.597
to get the kid back...

07:51.664 --> 07:53.803
Remember Baby M?
That got very nasty.

07:53.866 --> 07:56.176
Yeah, but they don't give
babies back to dead people.

07:56.235 --> 07:57.680
We got to find these parents.

07:57.736 --> 07:59.613
We can try to get the
adoption papers unsealed.

07:59.672 --> 08:03.415
By then, the kid will be getting
her first hickey. Oh, Miz.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.049
Our lawyer said that no one was
supposed to know who we were.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.889
How did you guys...
BRISCOE: His car service.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.156
They drove him here
with the baby.

08:12.217 --> 08:15.255
And the hospital told us you tried
to contact the biological parents.

08:16.322 --> 08:18.393
I didn't know we were
breaking any laws.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.365
Why were you looking for them?

08:22.828 --> 08:25.502
We waited five years
to get a child.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.608
I wrote them
a letter to thank them,

08:28.667 --> 08:31.705
and to let them know that
Maggie was in a good home.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.046
Mr. Tooley wouldn't
pass it on to them.

08:34.106 --> 08:35.779
So I found out
where Maggie was born.

08:35.908 --> 08:37.046
Did you ever talk
to the parents?

08:37.109 --> 08:38.850
No. The hospital wouldn't
give me their name.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.754
Where were you last
Sunday morning?

08:40.813 --> 08:44.158
We were at a friend's house in
Astoria Park with Ellen's parents.

08:44.216 --> 08:45.490
They were visiting
from Indiana.

08:45.584 --> 08:47.257
We'll need to talk
to your friend.

08:47.386 --> 08:49.161
Why? What's going on?

08:50.456 --> 08:53.699
(SIGHING) The baby's mother
was found dead last Sunday.

08:54.293 --> 08:55.863
Oh, my God.
What happened?

08:55.928 --> 08:57.236
CURTIS: We're not sure.

08:57.963 --> 09:01.308
Anyone ever tell you that she
wanted to revoke the adoption?

09:01.367 --> 09:02.402
No.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.073
I can't believe this.

09:04.136 --> 09:05.171
(BABY CRYING)

09:05.237 --> 09:06.580
Excuse me.

09:08.974 --> 09:10.044
Do they want Maggie back?

09:10.109 --> 09:11.144
CURTIS: The mother
might have.

09:11.276 --> 09:12.311
We don't know about the father.

09:12.378 --> 09:15.291
Well, 12 more days and it's official.
She's ours.

09:15.647 --> 09:17.957
I don't think you have anything
to worry about, Mr. O'Brien.

09:18.017 --> 09:21.988
We can't even remember what life
was like without her. It was...

09:22.554 --> 09:24.329
Isn't she beautiful?

09:24.890 --> 09:26.335
Hello, baby.

09:34.566 --> 09:36.876
CURTIS: It explains
a lot, Mr. Burdett.

09:36.935 --> 09:41.042
The hospital in Trenton, the
lateral pass to the baby broker.

09:41.106 --> 09:43.052
Whatever difficulties
Karin and I had,

09:43.108 --> 09:45.213
we worked out
like civilized people.

09:46.078 --> 09:47.523
Let me get this straight.

09:47.579 --> 09:50.150
Your wife cheats on you with...
What's his name?

09:50.349 --> 09:52.522
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.

09:53.152 --> 09:54.722
Okay, so she gets pregnant.

09:54.787 --> 09:57.233
Now, you don't kick her out,
you don't slap her around.

09:57.289 --> 09:59.895
You even let her have the baby.
Because you're so civilized?

09:59.958 --> 10:01.164
Yes.

10:02.094 --> 10:04.370
Nobody is that civilized, Josh.

10:04.430 --> 10:07.377
Yeah, all right, maybe if it was
one of your country club pals.

10:07.433 --> 10:11.313
But she was sweating up the sheets
with some big good-looking black stud.

10:11.370 --> 10:12.974
That can really
piss some people off.

10:13.038 --> 10:14.676
You that kind
of people, Mr. Burdett?

10:14.740 --> 10:16.014
No.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.952
If she gets the baby back,
everybody is gonna know.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.011
Stop it.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.079
She was playing Scarlett O'Hara

10:20.145 --> 10:21.215
with Mandingo!

10:21.280 --> 10:22.623
Enough. That's enough.

10:22.681 --> 10:24.490
I did not kill Karin.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.261
Now, I've said
all I want to say.

10:27.319 --> 10:29.993
I came here voluntarily.
Now, I'm leaving.

10:30.055 --> 10:33.229
If you want to talk to me
again, contact my attorney.

10:36.228 --> 10:38.230
This guy could keep
snowflakes in his mouth.

10:38.297 --> 10:39.970
Well, if he killed her,
it's probably not

10:40.032 --> 10:41.670
the first time
he laid a hand on her.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.235
You check with
the local precinct?

10:43.302 --> 10:44.781
Yeah. No record
of domestic calls.

10:44.837 --> 10:46.783
We asked the neighbors.
The walls are thick.

10:46.839 --> 10:48.819
They wouldn't have heard him if
he shot her out of a cannon.

10:48.874 --> 10:50.785
She have a job?
Yeah.

10:51.343 --> 10:54.756
Resource Development at the
Shuman Foundation for Women.

10:54.813 --> 10:55.917
It's a charity.

10:55.981 --> 11:00.225
Well, if it's anything like this
place, everybody knows her business.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.562
I do know she and Mr. Burdett were
having some problems over her pregnancy.

11:06.892 --> 11:09.031
You mean, they had arguments?
Physical arguments?

11:09.094 --> 11:12.303
God, no. I didn't mean to give
you the wrong impression.

11:12.364 --> 11:14.366
I just overheard a phone call.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.738
She was pretty furious.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.280
What did she say?

11:17.336 --> 11:19.612
I just heard a little.
She said something like,

11:19.671 --> 11:23.244
"It's your baby. It's damn time
you took responsibility for it."

11:24.009 --> 11:25.511
Maybe not those exact words.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.523
Are you sure she was
talking to Mr. Burdett?

11:27.579 --> 11:29.650
Well, I assumed it was him.

11:29.715 --> 11:31.695
Could it possibly have
been someone else?

11:31.750 --> 11:32.785
No.

11:33.018 --> 11:34.395
You mean...

11:34.620 --> 11:39.035
No, not Mrs. Burdett. I would have
picked up on something like that.

11:40.159 --> 11:43.902
Who would have figured in an office full
of women, she kept her affair a secret?

11:43.962 --> 11:46.568
You'd expect she'd put a
star next to her rendezvous?

11:46.632 --> 11:49.272
Depends how good her boyfriend is.
Here we go.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.008
Ian Fraser, Esquire.
Matrimonial Law.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.083
She was fooling around
with a divorce lawyer?

11:55.140 --> 11:56.676
No, I think this was business.

11:56.742 --> 11:59.348
She had an appointment
with him two weeks ago.

11:59.411 --> 12:01.357
Maybe she chose
the baby over Burdett.

12:01.413 --> 12:06.362
"Morris Keach, Vice President
of RLH Contracting"

12:06.785 --> 12:10.028
"and Co-Chairman of the Saint
Vincent Children's Foundation."

12:10.689 --> 12:14.398
Here he is accepting a $10,000
check from Karin Burdett.

12:16.061 --> 12:20.237
And here he is sharing a cocktail
with her at a Foundation luncheon.

12:20.566 --> 12:23.046
If they were any cozier, he'd
be sharing his pants with her.

12:23.101 --> 12:25.342
And he's the right complexion.

12:25.704 --> 12:29.914
We got friendly last year, when I
solicited her Foundation for a grant.

12:29.975 --> 12:31.682
She called me up
and asked me to lunch.

12:31.743 --> 12:34.087
Just like that? Out of the blue?
What did she want?

12:34.146 --> 12:35.181
Best I could figure,

12:35.247 --> 12:38.228
she wanted to talk about my kids.
I have three.

12:38.283 --> 12:41.059
She wanted to know what it's
like raising them in the city.

12:41.119 --> 12:43.429
She was looking for
a good nursery school?

12:43.488 --> 12:46.765
No. Raising them
as African Americans.

12:46.825 --> 12:49.704
What kind of problems
they might run into.

12:49.761 --> 12:52.435
She was thinking of adopting
an African American baby.

12:52.497 --> 12:55.341
Actually, Mr. Keach,
she gave birth to one.

12:55.534 --> 12:56.740
Really?

12:58.237 --> 13:00.808
You think I'm the father?
That's nuts.

13:00.873 --> 13:04.150
Look, Mr. Keach, you got yourself
in a jam We can understand that.

13:04.209 --> 13:06.120
And Karin Burdett wouldn't
let you off the hook.

13:06.178 --> 13:07.851
She expected help
with the baby.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.221
Now I know you're nuts.

13:09.281 --> 13:11.352
CURTIS: Yeah? Where were
you on Sunday morning?

13:11.416 --> 13:14.863
I went running at the reservoir.
This is unbelievable.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.422
I did not sleep
with Karin Burdett.

13:17.489 --> 13:19.765
So prove it to us.
Take a paternity test.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.738
I want to talk
to a lawyer first.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.100
He'll tell you we
can get a warrant.

13:23.161 --> 13:25.505
Well, then get one.

13:30.902 --> 13:33.746
Until the adoption is final, the
O'Briens are a little gun-shy.

13:33.805 --> 13:37.412
That's why they asked me to talk
to you about this paternity test.

13:37.476 --> 13:38.511
It's very simple.

13:38.577 --> 13:41.353
The police think whoever killed
Karin Burdett is the baby's father.

13:41.413 --> 13:44.326
They have a suspect, they'd
like to establish paternity.

13:44.383 --> 13:45.521
What's in it for the O'Briens?

13:45.584 --> 13:46.654
Nothing.

13:46.718 --> 13:49.221
Isn't doing your civic
duty its own reward?

13:49.288 --> 13:50.699
It's a headache
they don't need.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.669
Mr. Brody, we're talking about a
small blood sample from the baby.

13:53.725 --> 13:57.263
So you can determine that her
father murdered her mother?

13:57.329 --> 13:59.866
Little Maggie already has
more baggage than Greyhound.

13:59.932 --> 14:03.345
She's got inherited megaloblastic anemia.
She's got asthma.

14:03.402 --> 14:04.745
The O'Briens' cup runneth over.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.613
We feel badly for them,
but we have a situation.

14:09.508 --> 14:11.579
Well, let me talk to them.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.991
Ross is getting the big
stall from the O'Briens.

14:15.047 --> 14:17.357
Keach's lawyer won't let him
go anywhere near a needle.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.020
Can you bust his alibi?

14:19.084 --> 14:20.654
He was running by himself.

14:20.719 --> 14:23.563
We showed his picture around the reservoir.
Nobody remembers him.

14:23.622 --> 14:27.001
Toss it back to the D.A. Let them
worry about the paternity test.

14:27.059 --> 14:30.336
Actually, there might be another
way to hook up Keach to the baby.

14:30.395 --> 14:34.070
The kid has an inherited medical condition.
Megaloblastic anemia.

14:34.132 --> 14:37.602
So either Karin Burdett or Keach
would have had to pass it on.

14:37.669 --> 14:41.139
The M.E. said whoever passed it on to
the kid would be taking medication.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.482
Large doses of folio acid.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.648
Well, here's the inventory from
the Burdetts' medicine cabinet.

14:46.712 --> 14:48.953
Folate, one milligram tablets.

14:49.614 --> 14:52.254
Wait a minute,
that's not right.

14:52.317 --> 14:55.423
This prescription is made
out to Joshua Burdett.

14:57.055 --> 14:59.695
He's the father?
He's black?

15:00.792 --> 15:02.669
Maybe the pharmacy
made a mistake.

15:02.728 --> 15:04.969
Or maybe he's taking
it as a supplement.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.203
I heard it's good
for thinning hair.

15:07.265 --> 15:09.506
Burdett has
an ex-wife, right?

15:10.135 --> 15:12.172
Ask her if he has anemia.

15:13.071 --> 15:16.018
Yes, Josh has the condition.

15:16.074 --> 15:19.021
We were worried that he might
pass it on to our son David,

15:19.077 --> 15:20.750
but we were lucky.

15:21.179 --> 15:23.682
BRISCOE: Mrs. Houston,
far as you know,

15:23.749 --> 15:26.286
what's your ex-husband's
ethnic background?

15:27.152 --> 15:30.861
Burdett is an old
Anglo-Scottish name.

15:30.922 --> 15:33.766
And his mother, I think,
was French-Italian.

15:33.825 --> 15:37.136
Did you ever meet his relatives
or see any pictures of them?

15:37.195 --> 15:41.337
Josh was an only child, and his
parents died when he was very young.

15:41.767 --> 15:42.973
What are you getting at?

15:43.034 --> 15:46.743
His late wife gave birth to a
baby with megaloblastic anemia.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.784
The baby was part black.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.754
That's... Oh, what about
Karin's parentage?

15:53.045 --> 15:55.685
Danish. About as
white as you can get.

15:56.148 --> 15:58.424
Excuse me.

15:59.384 --> 16:03.628
David, would you and Veronica go
upstairs please, until I'm finished?

16:05.657 --> 16:07.295
Thank you, honey.

16:10.896 --> 16:13.342
You saw my son.
He's not black.

16:14.399 --> 16:15.469
And neither is Josh.

16:15.534 --> 16:18.140
I'm sorry, Mrs. Houston,
but this baby...

16:18.336 --> 16:20.077
Karin was unstable.

16:20.672 --> 16:23.016
I called Josh
that Sunday morning.

16:23.074 --> 16:25.315
He had to go out
and get her some pills.

16:25.577 --> 16:28.421
I could hear her
screaming like a banshee.

16:29.414 --> 16:32.725
She was capable
of anything with anybody.

16:33.485 --> 16:35.055
We've already
been down that road.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.656
Josh is not black.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.461
I was married to him for nineteen years.
I'd know.

16:43.829 --> 16:44.967
(DOOR OPENING)

16:45.130 --> 16:46.939
BRISCOE: Your lawyer
is on his way in.

16:47.999 --> 16:51.139
To pass the time, let's talk about
you volunteering a blood sample.

16:51.503 --> 16:52.641
For what?

16:52.704 --> 16:53.808
A paternity test.

16:54.773 --> 16:57.777
You and that baby you can't
run away from fast enough.

16:57.843 --> 16:59.914
That's ridiculous.
I'm not the father.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.980
Well, you both
have the same anemia.

17:02.047 --> 17:04.425
So do thousands
of other people.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.487
First I killed Karin because she
had a child by another man.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.759
Then I killed her
because she had my child?

17:09.887 --> 17:11.628
Because she wanted
to keep your child.

17:12.958 --> 17:17.304
And because everybody in your
just-us-white-folks executive suite

17:17.362 --> 17:19.672
was gonna find out
you're black, Josh.

17:19.731 --> 17:22.176
That's absurd.
I mean, look at me.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.549
I want to talk to him.

17:34.246 --> 17:35.748
(DOOR CLOSING)

17:40.852 --> 17:42.525
Hello, my brother.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.862
Damn, look at you.

17:49.127 --> 17:51.334
You did it. You passed.

17:53.231 --> 17:57.577
You know, I thought up close I'd be
able to tell, but I swear, I can't.

17:58.737 --> 18:01.775
So what's it like when
it's just you and them?

18:05.010 --> 18:07.820
You laugh along when
they tell the jokes?

18:09.114 --> 18:11.822
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

18:12.684 --> 18:17.758
Or do you tell nigger jokes, too,
just to keep up appearances?

18:17.823 --> 18:19.097
If you don't mind.

18:20.091 --> 18:25.404
Oh, am I sitting too close? What, I
remind you of somebody? Your mother?

18:26.498 --> 18:29.035
Was she dark-skinned?
High yellow?

18:30.068 --> 18:31.376
Redbone?

18:35.907 --> 18:38.148
You're scared now, aren't you?

18:39.678 --> 18:42.386
You been scared
for almost 40 years.

18:43.181 --> 18:45.889
And all that fear came
gushing out Sunday morning.

18:45.951 --> 18:48.363
You panicked.
Isn't that right?

18:50.755 --> 18:54.567
You go ahead.
Tell me what happened.

18:56.428 --> 19:00.376
Take the weight off, my brother.
You'll feel better.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.408
I'm Mr. Burdett's attorney.

19:06.471 --> 19:09.645
You mind telling me what
my client is doing here?

19:10.275 --> 19:13.313
We're arresting your client
for the murder of his wife.

19:13.378 --> 19:14.652
Take him down to booking.

19:14.713 --> 19:16.420
BRISCOE: Josh Burdett,
you're under arrest.

19:16.481 --> 19:18.154
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:18.216 --> 19:21.390
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.625
You have the right
to an attorney...

19:25.023 --> 19:26.627
It seems he had
everybody fooled.

19:26.691 --> 19:28.693
His whole life was a charade.
It's pathetic.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.967
Maybe 30, 40 years ago
it made more sense.

19:31.029 --> 19:33.566
Back then they had lynch
mobs and bullwhips.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.374
Now they use toilet plungers.
Progress.

19:37.269 --> 19:40.079
You confirmed that he's
the father of this child?

19:40.138 --> 19:42.846
We're just waiting for a
blood sample from the baby.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.545
What else?
Weak alibi.

19:44.609 --> 19:47.283
Forensics to establish
the manner of death.

19:47.345 --> 19:51.054
His motive being that he didn't want
anyone to know he was black. Why?

19:51.116 --> 19:53.118
Shame, loss of friends,
his work.

19:53.184 --> 19:54.857
I can just imagine
what he was afraid of.

19:54.919 --> 19:57.058
Don't imagine it.
Prove it.

19:57.355 --> 19:58.800
(PHONE RINGING)

20:00.725 --> 20:04.002
Madeline's phone number.
I promised her you'd call.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.243
Ross. Yeah.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.973
Since when?
We'll get right on it.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.506
That was Curtis.
The adoptive mother

20:14.572 --> 20:16.518
has disappeared with the baby.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.312
I don't know where they are.

20:18.376 --> 20:19.446
She left without telling you?

20:19.511 --> 20:20.546
What's it to you?

20:20.612 --> 20:22.319
They can come
and go as they please.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.020
That child's paternity
is evidence in a murder.

20:25.083 --> 20:26.585
I'm her father.

20:26.651 --> 20:29.461
You're crazy if you think I'm gonna
help you to prove Burdett is anything.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.023
Why? What are you
worried about?

20:31.089 --> 20:33.194
If Mr. Burdett turns out
to be the biological father,

20:33.258 --> 20:35.465
it gives him legal standing
to revoke the adoption.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.700
His wife wanted our baby back.
Maybe he does, too.

20:37.762 --> 20:40.641
Who told you that?
Was it Mr. Burdett?

20:41.166 --> 20:43.009
Did he threaten you
or pay you to do this?

20:43.068 --> 20:45.742
The paternity test could help
convict Burdett of murder.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.977
No judge will ever grant
custody to a murderer.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.541
Tell that to the Simpson kids.

20:50.008 --> 20:53.649
Mr. O'Brien, I have a court
order for the paternity test.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.783
I can compel you to tell
us where your child is.

20:55.847 --> 20:58.088
What are you going to do,
cite him for contempt?

20:58.149 --> 21:00.026
His position is,
he doesn't know

21:00.085 --> 21:02.463
where his wife
and baby are. Period.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.228
We need that test.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.930
We need to turn up
the heat on O'Brien.

21:08.994 --> 21:10.564
If he's getting
paid off by Burdett,

21:10.628 --> 21:12.608
he's on the hook for a
lot more than contempt.

21:12.664 --> 21:14.109
I'll get Briscoe
and Curtis on it.

21:14.165 --> 21:17.544
Then talk to Burdett's employers.
Let's nail down his motive.

21:18.370 --> 21:21.374
You can't be right, Ms. Ross.
Josh is a straight arrow.

21:21.439 --> 21:23.282
If he says he's white,
he's white.

21:24.175 --> 21:26.280
He checked white
on his application.

21:26.344 --> 21:28.688
I thought it was illegal
to ask an applicant's race.

21:28.747 --> 21:33.958
It is now. That was filled out in 1963.
The bad old days.

21:34.652 --> 21:36.325
What if he'd said he was black?

21:36.388 --> 21:39.460
He was hired as a sales associate
in our Richmond office.

21:39.524 --> 21:42.403
The market was southern
doctors and pharmacists.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.872
The application would have
ended up in the trash.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.876
And now? If the company found
out he was African American?

21:47.932 --> 21:51.709
Now? Hell, we'd probably
put him on the board.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.840
(CHUCKLING) Cheaper
than Colin Powell.

21:55.039 --> 21:57.781
You're wrong about Josh. I've
known the man for twenty years,

21:57.842 --> 21:59.253
and I never saw any hint

21:59.310 --> 22:01.256
he was anything
but what he said he was.

22:01.312 --> 22:02.757
What kind of hints
were you looking for?

22:02.814 --> 22:03.986
Well, for example,

22:04.048 --> 22:07.860
there was a young black man a
couple of years ago. Shawn Taitt.

22:07.919 --> 22:10.593
A real comer
Josh put under his wing.

22:11.055 --> 22:14.901
Then one day, he's gone. Josh
had enough of the attitude.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.802
Everything was
"black this, black that"

22:17.028 --> 22:18.268
Mr. Burdett fired him?

22:18.329 --> 22:19.501
And get us sued?

22:20.331 --> 22:23.175
Josh promoted him
to our office in Duluth.

22:24.102 --> 22:28.881
One sub-zero winter, and
Taitt got the idea. He quit.

22:30.542 --> 22:33.352
Mr. Burdett told your colleagues
you had an attitude problem.

22:33.411 --> 22:35.391
Maybe that's what he told
them, but we got along fine

22:35.447 --> 22:37.324
until I found out
he was from Knoxville.

22:37.382 --> 22:39.953
What, you don't like
people from Knoxville?

22:40.018 --> 22:41.554
I told him I had family there.

22:41.619 --> 22:43.496
And they knew a Burdett family.

22:43.555 --> 22:45.193
A black family.
Mmm-hmm.

22:45.256 --> 22:47.463
A month later I was
shipped off to Duluth.

22:47.525 --> 22:49.004
Did you suspect why?

22:49.060 --> 22:50.505
Mmm-hmm.
He was passing.

22:51.196 --> 22:52.971
You could have sued.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.874
Why make trouble for the man?
He's a whole other generation.

22:56.935 --> 22:58.175
I can just imagine
what he went through,

22:58.236 --> 23:02.150
being a black kid
in Tennessee in the '50s.

23:03.608 --> 23:04.814
(SIGHING)

23:04.876 --> 23:07.288
That's the fourteenth Burdett
I've spoken to in Knoxville.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.518
Not one of them will
claim Josh Burdett.

23:09.581 --> 23:11.686
What about birth records?

23:11.749 --> 23:13.786
They're in the Knox
county clerk's office.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.889
They're working on it, but
it might take some time.

23:15.954 --> 23:19.731
There's nothing in his personal records either.
No birth certificate,

23:19.791 --> 23:22.328
no relatives in his
address book, no photos.

23:22.393 --> 23:24.634
The paternity test might be our
only way to prove he's black.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.073
What's happening
with the O'Briens?

23:26.131 --> 23:28.042
The police haven't found
any pay-offs by Burdett.

23:28.099 --> 23:31.012
But they turned up this check.

23:34.772 --> 23:39.778
Leonard Hillman, Esquire.
Twenty thousand dollars.

23:39.844 --> 23:42.017
Burdett wrote it a week
before his wife died.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.754
Hillman specializes in employment
discrimination claims.

23:44.816 --> 23:48.423
Yeah, he sued this office
two years ago.

23:48.486 --> 23:52.024
So, what does a white male executive
need with a civil rights attorney?

23:52.790 --> 23:54.292
I'll ask.

23:57.295 --> 23:59.332
By the way,
how'd it go last night?

24:00.231 --> 24:04.680
With Madeline? She's bright, attractive, funny.
As advertised. Thanks.

24:04.736 --> 24:06.977
You're welcome.

24:07.038 --> 24:10.611
In case you're wondering, she thought
you were charming, passionate.

24:10.675 --> 24:11.813
Passionate?

24:11.876 --> 24:12.980
About your work.

24:13.044 --> 24:14.182
(CHUCKLES)

24:15.747 --> 24:18.387
She said you mentioned
Claire Kincaid.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.761
Because Madeline's brother spent
three months in the hospital

24:21.819 --> 24:24.857
thanks to a drunk driver.
I was not obsessing.

24:24.923 --> 24:28.894
Don't worry. For some reason
she'd like to see you again.

24:34.332 --> 24:36.278
Yes, Mr. Burdett
came to see me.

24:36.334 --> 24:38.541
No, I can't tell you
what we discussed.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.413
Fine. So let's discuss
my problem, Mr. Hillman.

24:41.472 --> 24:44.510
Just so happens in my spare time
I'm president of a large company.

24:44.575 --> 24:45.610
Go on.

24:45.677 --> 24:46.951
This company
doesn't hire women.

24:47.011 --> 24:50.788
So I've mislead my employers and the
shareholders by claiming I'm a man.

24:50.849 --> 24:53.329
And they fell for it?
Hard to believe.

24:53.384 --> 24:54.658
Can I be fired for that?

24:54.719 --> 24:57.928
As a general rule, misrepresentations
not material to your work

24:57.989 --> 24:59.593
are not grounds for dismissal.

24:59.657 --> 25:04.072
So if they fire me for lying
about my gender, or race,

25:04.128 --> 25:06.108
they're liable for a claim
of wrongful termination?

25:06.164 --> 25:08.474
Yes. But in the hypothetical,

25:08.533 --> 25:11.980
most executives are employed under
personal services contracts,

25:12.036 --> 25:15.813
which have standard provisions for
termination for acts of moral turpitude.

25:15.873 --> 25:17.250
Such as lying.
Yes.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.117
But, again in the hypothetical,

25:19.177 --> 25:22.715
that could put your considerable
stocks and pension benefits at risk.

25:22.780 --> 25:26.057
You charge the average executive
$20,000 to talk about those risks?

25:26.117 --> 25:28.825
No, what Joshua Burdett
paid me is a retainer.

25:28.886 --> 25:31.867
'Cause he thought
he was about to get fired?

25:31.923 --> 25:35.666
Because his company was about to
find out he's African American?

25:35.727 --> 25:37.502
I can't comment.

25:38.296 --> 25:41.675
Burdett has a retirement
package worth over $8,000,000.

25:41.733 --> 25:43.303
With stock options,
it's double that.

25:43.368 --> 25:46.008
(LAUGHS) We're in
the wrong business.

25:47.038 --> 25:49.644
Burdett concluded it'd be
cheaper to kill his wife.

25:49.707 --> 25:52.051
Except he paid
the lawyer a retainer.

25:52.110 --> 25:54.454
The lawyer as much as told me that
Burdett and his wife had decided

25:54.512 --> 25:56.583
to get their baby back.

25:56.647 --> 25:58.388
There goes his motive.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.459
Why do you always give me bad
news while I'm digesting?

26:03.588 --> 26:05.534
If it's true, why
didn't Burdett tell us?

26:05.590 --> 26:07.467
Is there somebody
he's trying to protect?

26:08.860 --> 26:12.069
(SIGHING) He has an ex-wife
and a teenage son.

26:12.130 --> 26:14.235
Even if Burdett was willing to
take the heat for his decision,

26:14.299 --> 26:15.471
maybe they weren't.

26:15.533 --> 26:20.448
Will you please find out what they
were doing that Sunday morning?

26:20.505 --> 26:22.451
I'll get this.

26:23.274 --> 26:25.515
Frances Houston,
Burdett's ex-wife,

26:25.576 --> 26:26.953
said she called
him in the morning,

26:27.011 --> 26:31.289
just before he went to the pharmacy.
That's confirmed by her IUDs.

26:31.349 --> 26:33.727
We got calls on her line
and on her son's,

26:33.785 --> 26:37.858
roughly 20 minutes before and
after Mrs. Burdett was killed.

26:37.922 --> 26:40.095
They live about 10 minutes
from the Burdetts.

26:40.158 --> 26:42.035
So either of them
had the time to do it.

26:42.093 --> 26:43.902
But look at these.

26:43.961 --> 26:48.034
IUDs from last week. Ms. Houston
got a 12-minute collect call

26:48.099 --> 26:50.705
from a convenience store
in Hobart, Indiana.

26:51.102 --> 26:53.207
The adoptive mother, don't
her parents live in Indiana?

26:53.271 --> 26:56.343
Yes. Look at the next call
Ms. Houston made.

26:58.176 --> 26:59.587
Western Union.

26:59.644 --> 27:02.557
I doubt she was sending
birthday greetings.

27:02.613 --> 27:07.926
Ms. Houston wired $3,000 to a
Mrs. Teresa Gaydos in Hobart.

27:07.985 --> 27:09.521
She's your mother-in-law,
isn't she?

27:09.587 --> 27:13.865
Mr. O'Brien, hindering
prosecution is a felony.

27:13.925 --> 27:18.567
If you don't cooperate now,
today, I will prosecute you.

27:18.629 --> 27:20.506
You and your wife
will go to jail.

27:20.565 --> 27:21.873
You will lose
custody of your baby.

27:21.933 --> 27:22.968
Mr. McCoy...

27:23.034 --> 27:24.877
I mean it!

27:24.936 --> 27:28.247
People who get in the way of
my murder cases get run over.

27:37.382 --> 27:39.589
He tells you what he knows,

27:39.651 --> 27:42.791
you don't press charges
against him or his wife.

27:42.854 --> 27:44.856
Let's hear it.

27:46.357 --> 27:48.769
Ms. Houston came to us
before Burdett was arrested

27:48.826 --> 27:52.069
and she said, "Watch out.
Burdett didn't kill his wife."

27:52.764 --> 27:54.141
She said once
he clears himself,

27:54.198 --> 27:55.734
he's gonna
fight us for the baby.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.646
She told us to take Maggie out of state.
She even offered us money.

27:59.704 --> 28:01.706
Did she say why
she was doing this?

28:01.772 --> 28:05.185
I can't understand how an educated
woman like her could say it,

28:05.243 --> 28:07.416
but she said

28:07.478 --> 28:11.392
she didn't want "some nappy-haired
little monkey" ruining her family.

28:19.357 --> 28:23.100
Now you don't think he killed his wife?
Thanks for telling us.

28:23.161 --> 28:26.665
The bad news is, we might charge
him with hindering prosecution.

28:26.731 --> 28:27.937
Prosecution of whom?

28:27.999 --> 28:29.637
The police identified
the fingerprints

28:29.700 --> 28:31.509
found in your bedroom
and on the balcony.

28:31.569 --> 28:34.345
They found yours, your
wife's, your housekeeper's,

28:34.405 --> 28:35.611
and your ex-wife's.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.243
Frances?

28:37.308 --> 28:40.084
She paid the O'Briens
to take the baby out of state.

28:40.144 --> 28:41.851
We think she killed your wife.

28:44.315 --> 28:46.295
Anything you want to
tell us, Mr. Burdett?

28:51.989 --> 28:54.560
Uh, excuse us.

29:00.698 --> 29:05.169
For now, whatever my client
tells you is off the record.

29:07.405 --> 29:09.214
Let's hear it.

29:11.843 --> 29:15.290
Before we were married, I told
Karin about my background.

29:15.346 --> 29:20.728
It was our secret. But the
pregnancy was a mistake.

29:20.785 --> 29:23.857
We argued for weeks
about terminating it.

29:23.921 --> 29:26.492
We finally agreed
on the adoption.

29:27.625 --> 29:32.096
But after we gave up our baby,
Karin became so unhappy.

29:32.897 --> 29:33.932
(SIGHING)

29:33.998 --> 29:37.775
I loved her,
she wanted our child back,

29:38.736 --> 29:41.273
so that's what
we decided to do.

29:42.340 --> 29:46.482
That Saturday, I told my son
the truth about everything.

29:46.544 --> 29:48.285
The next morning,
Frances called me.

29:48.346 --> 29:51.520
She said David was angry
and behaving erratically.

29:51.582 --> 29:55.689
She begged me to reconsider.
I said our mind was made up.

29:56.654 --> 30:01.501
I didn't know what to think after Karin died.
I called Frances.

30:02.560 --> 30:06.804
She said Karin was dead and
we had to protect our son.

30:07.632 --> 30:09.509
She told you your son
killed your wife?

30:09.567 --> 30:10.671
No.

30:10.735 --> 30:14.182
No, not in so many words.
But that's what I understood.

30:14.238 --> 30:16.980
That's why I misled the police.

30:18.743 --> 30:21.087
I discussed your offer
with Ms. Houston.

30:21.145 --> 30:24.615
I explained that prosecutors don't
just like to beat the other guy.

30:24.682 --> 30:26.593
They want him to
limp off the field.

30:26.651 --> 30:29.131
No wiggle room,
Ms. Joyner.

30:29.187 --> 30:31.292
Manslaughter one,
eight-and-a-third-to-25,

30:31.355 --> 30:33.198
or she goes on trial
for murder two.

30:33.257 --> 30:35.066
Then you won't like my counter.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.629
Second degree manslaughter,
minimum time.

30:37.695 --> 30:40.938
That's unrealistic. We've got her
prints, her pay-offs to the O'Briens.

30:40.998 --> 30:43.672
I said man two, minimum time.

30:43.734 --> 30:46.476
Do you really want to put your son
through a trial, Ms. Houston?

30:46.537 --> 30:48.175
Let her worry about her son.

30:48.239 --> 30:51.413
Frankly, Ms. Joyner, I'm surprised
you'd represent a bigot.

30:55.413 --> 30:58.519
I don't see a bigot here.
I see a woman deceived

30:58.582 --> 31:01.688
and pushed to the brink
by a self-hating coward.

31:01.752 --> 31:04.164
Everyone at my firm
agrees, Mr. McCoy.

31:04.622 --> 31:06.568
No jury will ever convict her.

31:12.763 --> 31:15.039
This trial is about a baby.

31:16.901 --> 31:21.907
A child of white and
African American parents.

31:23.074 --> 31:27.181
Karin Burdett bore it.
She wanted to raise it.

31:27.244 --> 31:29.121
That's why she's dead.

31:32.283 --> 31:33.762
The evidence will show that

31:33.818 --> 31:37.960
Frances Houston knew Karin
Burdett was home alone,

31:38.990 --> 31:43.132
that she struggled with her, and
pushed her off of a balcony.

31:43.961 --> 31:46.066
That she bribed a witness.

31:47.064 --> 31:49.977
That she did all this
because she didn't want

31:50.034 --> 31:52.514
her narrow-minded
circle of friends

31:52.570 --> 31:56.313
to know that she had once
been married to a black man.

31:56.374 --> 32:02.655
Because, as she stated in the
vicious vocabulary of racism,

32:05.516 --> 32:08.622
she didn't want a
"nappy-haired little monkey"

32:12.456 --> 32:14.868
ruining her good name.

32:21.299 --> 32:23.745
JOYNER: Mr. McCoy wants you to
believe that my client is a bigot.

32:23.801 --> 32:25.542
Well, I'm here to
tell you she's not.

32:25.603 --> 32:29.312
She's a realist. She knows
what goes on in America.

32:30.374 --> 32:35.153
You'll hear that educated black men earn
far less than their white counterparts.

32:35.212 --> 32:37.715
That black men are denied
the access, the promotions,

32:37.782 --> 32:40.319
the memberships
given to white men.

32:40.384 --> 32:45.231
That black men are routinely harassed
and brutalized by the police.

32:45.289 --> 32:47.667
That's what my client
was thinking about.

32:47.725 --> 32:49.830
She wanted to
preserve for her son

32:49.894 --> 32:52.841
the protection the word
"white" afforded him.

32:52.897 --> 32:55.741
She didn't want him
to have a lesser life,

32:55.800 --> 32:59.509
because the word "black" had
been added next to his name.

33:01.138 --> 33:02.515
If, at the end of this trial,

33:02.573 --> 33:06.749
you believe that my client caused
the death of Karin Burdett,

33:06.811 --> 33:12.022
please understand it was not the
premeditated act of a racist,

33:12.083 --> 33:15.326
but the unintentional act
of a mother

33:15.386 --> 33:18.128
desperate to save
the son she loves.

33:20.424 --> 33:22.631
JACK: She didn't do it
because she's a racist,

33:22.693 --> 33:25.230
she did it to protect
her son from racists.

33:25.296 --> 33:26.866
It explains their witness list.

33:26.931 --> 33:29.104
Statisticians,
social scientists.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.874
You got to admit, that's
some mitigation defense.

33:31.936 --> 33:33.472
Something for every prejudice.

33:33.537 --> 33:36.040
The white jurors wouldn't want their
kids growing up black either.

33:36.107 --> 33:37.950
And black jurors
because they know

33:38.008 --> 33:40.648
that the playing field
isn't level?

33:40.711 --> 33:43.590
If I were the defense, I wouldn't
count on much support there.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.923
How many whites on the jury?
More than one?

33:45.983 --> 33:48.327
That's all Ms. Houston
needs for a mistrial.

33:48.385 --> 33:50.387
If the jury
disregards the facts.

33:50.454 --> 33:53.458
Fine, you win their minds,
she wins their hearts.

33:53.524 --> 33:55.265
I'm not ready
to concede anything.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.397
All we have to do
is convince the jury

33:57.461 --> 34:00.772
that her son would be no worse off
living as a black man in this country.

34:00.831 --> 34:04.711
You can start by making sure they
never hear from these witnesses.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.511
JOYNER: These witnesses
are relevant, Your Honor.

34:08.572 --> 34:11.518
Professor Murphy's study quantifies
the economic discrepancies

34:11.574 --> 34:12.610
between the races.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.418
Professor Harrison's work
on law enforcement practices

34:15.478 --> 34:16.685
has been cited in every...

34:16.746 --> 34:18.351
None of which has anything
to do with her client.

34:18.415 --> 34:20.257
It goes to her state of mind,

34:20.317 --> 34:23.230
her fear her son would suffer the
fate of many African Americans.

34:23.286 --> 34:27.132
Your Honor, if Ms. Joyner wants to
establish her client's state of mind,

34:27.190 --> 34:28.898
she can call her to the stand.

34:28.958 --> 34:32.804
Even if I do, these witnesses are
evidence that her beliefs and concerns

34:32.862 --> 34:35.342
about racism in this
country are reasonable.

34:35.399 --> 34:37.379
JACK: There's no question
the beliefs are reasonable.

34:37.435 --> 34:40.279
The issue is whether or not her
client actually believes them.

34:40.337 --> 34:41.679
We wouldn't be here
if she didn't.

34:41.739 --> 34:44.014
JUDGE STEIN:
Simmer down, counselors.

34:44.074 --> 34:47.851
Ms. Joyner, the case is about
the defendant's state of mind,

34:47.911 --> 34:50.085
not the State of the Union.

34:50.147 --> 34:54.562
And since these witnesses
have no direct knowledge

34:54.618 --> 34:58.122
of what your client was
thinking, they're excluded.

34:58.189 --> 35:00.567
Now, let's get back to court.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.300
Frances kept telling me
we had to protect David.

35:06.363 --> 35:09.435
I felt I had no choice
but to lie to the police.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.674
JACK: Before this incident, was the
defendant aware you were black?

35:12.736 --> 35:15.148
Yes. She found out
six years ago,

35:15.206 --> 35:18.449
when my sister appeared at
our door, looking for me.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.948
In nearly 20 years of marriage
she had never met your family?

35:23.013 --> 35:26.517
No. I'd cut myself
off from them.

35:26.584 --> 35:29.963
You see, when I was a child,

35:30.020 --> 35:33.832
my mother always
told me I had good skin,

35:33.891 --> 35:37.338
good features, good hair.

35:37.394 --> 35:41.672
Back then, in Knoxville,
Tennessee, "good" meant "white."

35:42.533 --> 35:44.672
I was often mistaken for white.

35:44.735 --> 35:46.772
I could sit at
the front of the bus,

35:46.837 --> 35:50.410
I could drink at the water
fountain reserved for whites.

35:50.474 --> 35:52.886
You can't imagine what
an advantage that was

35:52.943 --> 35:56.584
when you're bone-dry thirsty
on a hot summer's day

35:56.647 --> 36:00.595
and it's another 20 blocks
to a colored water fountain.

36:00.651 --> 36:05.122
After college, I got a good job,
because I passed for white.

36:05.189 --> 36:08.830
I was promoted, I was
transferred to New York.

36:09.627 --> 36:12.039
No one ever asked me
if I was white.

36:12.096 --> 36:14.474
Frances had no reason
to question me.

36:15.232 --> 36:17.212
JACK: After she met
your sister, what happened?

36:17.268 --> 36:19.179
She was very upset.

36:20.337 --> 36:22.840
She wanted a divorce.

36:22.907 --> 36:25.319
In the divorce agreement,

36:25.376 --> 36:28.289
were any special conditions
imposed by the defendant?

36:28.345 --> 36:30.154
Yes, Frances asked that...

36:30.214 --> 36:32.319
Objection.
Approach, Your Honor?

36:36.253 --> 36:38.961
Your Honor, the witness and the
defendant signed a binding agreement

36:39.023 --> 36:40.832
not to disclose the
terms of their divorce.

36:40.891 --> 36:43.132
Without paying
a substantial penalty.

36:43.194 --> 36:45.367
Mr. Burdett is willing to
write Ms. Houston a check.

36:45.429 --> 36:47.409
There are third parties
to be considered here.

36:47.464 --> 36:49.808
Namely, the defendant's son.

36:49.867 --> 36:54.407
Mr. McCoy, what term of the divorce do
you want your witness to testify to?

36:54.471 --> 36:57.714
The defendant exacted his promise that
he wouldn't tell anyone he was black.

36:57.775 --> 37:00.221
We'll stipulate
to that, Your Honor.

37:00.277 --> 37:01.688
(SIGHING) All right.

37:01.745 --> 37:04.055
Objection sustained.

37:04.114 --> 37:06.560
Members of the jury,

37:06.617 --> 37:11.623
the defense stipulates for the record
that Mr. Burdett and Ms. Houston

37:11.689 --> 37:17.139
agreed as a condition of their divorce
not to disclose Mr. Burdett's race.

37:18.495 --> 37:20.202
Go on, Mr. McCoy.

37:20.831 --> 37:21.969
No more questions.

37:25.135 --> 37:29.140
Mr. Burdett, doesn't the fact that
no one found out you were black

37:29.206 --> 37:32.016
prove you're
an accomplished liar?

37:32.076 --> 37:34.647
I lied once,
on an application form.

37:34.712 --> 37:36.817
After that, the question
never came up.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.621
You passed for white because
it gave you an advantage

37:38.682 --> 37:40.525
over other African
Americans, isn't that right?

37:40.584 --> 37:41.619
Yes.

37:41.685 --> 37:42.925
You saw how blacks were treated

37:42.987 --> 37:45.024
by your white friends
and colleagues?

37:45.089 --> 37:46.329
Yes.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.098
You didn't want that to happen
to you, isn't that right?

37:49.159 --> 37:50.160
Yes.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.935
Then why make it happen
for your son?

37:52.997 --> 37:56.274
Why did you decide now to come
out of the racial closet?

37:56.333 --> 37:57.744
Things aren't the same anymore.

37:57.801 --> 37:58.836
Really?

37:58.902 --> 38:02.782
When you started at
Northfield Pharmaceuticals,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.583
how many black presidents, vice-presidents
and directors were there?

38:06.643 --> 38:07.747
None.

38:07.811 --> 38:08.881
And now?

38:08.946 --> 38:12.359
Three directors, in Human
Resources and Marketing.

38:12.416 --> 38:16.455
Out of how many executives?
Ten? Thirty?

38:16.520 --> 38:19.160
Nationwide, over 150.

38:19.223 --> 38:22.796
Well, the Reverend King
can rest easy.

38:22.860 --> 38:25.739
His dream
has finally come to pass.

38:25.796 --> 38:26.797
Objection.

38:26.864 --> 38:27.865
Withdrawn.

38:28.766 --> 38:31.542
There's nothing in the divorce
agreement other than what I told you.

38:31.602 --> 38:34.549
I don't want to be taken by surprise.
Why did they object?

38:34.605 --> 38:36.607
I have no idea what
Frances was thinking.

38:36.674 --> 38:38.415
Now, you'll have to excuse me.

38:40.277 --> 38:43.053
You looked at the divorce decree, Jack.
There was nothing there.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.490
Pull the full
record of the divorce.

38:44.548 --> 38:47.119
Depositions, draft agreements,
filings, everything.

38:47.184 --> 38:48.527
Most of it's probably sealed.

38:48.586 --> 38:49.860
Get a court order.

38:51.388 --> 38:53.868
I tried to reason with Karin.

38:53.924 --> 38:58.236
I begged her to think about Josh's son,
and what she would be doing to him.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.798
But I wasn't getting through.

39:00.864 --> 39:02.673
What was going
through your mind?

39:02.733 --> 39:05.270
(SIGHING) All I could
think about was David.

39:05.336 --> 39:07.839
How his life would be changed.

39:08.105 --> 39:11.382
All of his friends are white. And
all of their friends are white.

39:11.442 --> 39:16.289
I was afraid for him, for the same
reasons that Josh kept secret his...

39:16.347 --> 39:17.451
Objection.

39:17.514 --> 39:18.822
JUDGE STEIN: Sustained.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.088
Go on with what happened.

39:22.152 --> 39:26.999
Karin said she wasn't feeling well,
and that she needed some air.

39:27.057 --> 39:31.369
She went out onto the balcony
and our argument heated up.

39:31.428 --> 39:35.137
At one point she was wagging her
finger at me and I slapped it away.

39:35.199 --> 39:39.614
And then suddenly she grabbed
my hair and I pushed her.

39:39.670 --> 39:43.243
Before I realized what was
happening, she lost her balance

39:43.307 --> 39:46.151
and she went over the balcony.

39:47.444 --> 39:48.718
Was that your intent?

39:48.779 --> 39:50.019
No.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.026
All I could think
about was David.

39:52.082 --> 39:56.053
I just wanted to protect my
son, as any mother would.

39:56.787 --> 39:59.666
I never thought to kill Karin.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.265
Thank you.

40:06.563 --> 40:09.976
Did you seriously expect Mrs. Burdett
to abandon her baby girl

40:10.034 --> 40:11.308
for the sake of your son?

40:11.368 --> 40:15.874
I don't know what I expected her to do.
I just needed to talk to her.

40:15.939 --> 40:19.853
Because you were concerned that
your son's future was in peril

40:19.910 --> 40:21.412
if it became known
he was black?

40:21.478 --> 40:22.616
Yes.

40:22.679 --> 40:24.090
Even in this day and age?

40:24.148 --> 40:25.821
Oh, yes, Mr. McCoy.

40:25.883 --> 40:28.921
For every Tiger Woods, there's
a thousand Fuzzy Zoellers

40:28.986 --> 40:31.262
and I did not want
David to go through life

40:31.321 --> 40:32.925
facing that kind of prejudice.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.196
Prejudice where?
At school?

40:34.258 --> 40:35.430
Oh, yes.

40:35.492 --> 40:38.029
Aren't there other African
American students in his class?

40:38.095 --> 40:42.305
The only black student
they have is from Bermuda.

40:44.268 --> 40:47.374
Who decided to send
your son to this school?

40:49.373 --> 40:51.011
It was your decision,
wasn't it, Ms. Houston?

40:51.074 --> 40:52.417
Objection.

40:52.476 --> 40:53.750
Overruled.

40:53.811 --> 40:56.382
Answer his question,
Ms. Houston.

40:57.881 --> 41:00.384
My father went to
the Chase Academy.

41:00.451 --> 41:02.124
They have excellent academics.

41:02.186 --> 41:04.996
And no African American
students.

41:05.055 --> 41:06.830
Isn't that the real reason?
No.

41:06.890 --> 41:09.029
You wanted your son
to go to a white school,

41:09.093 --> 41:10.231
to have white friends.
Isn't that right?

41:10.294 --> 41:11.329
No.

41:11.395 --> 41:12.897
Because you don't like
African Americans.

41:12.963 --> 41:14.442
That's not true.

41:14.498 --> 41:16.171
You didn't want your
white friends to know

41:16.233 --> 41:17.735
you'd been married
to one, did you?

41:17.801 --> 41:19.508
No.
That you'd shared your bed

41:19.570 --> 41:21.015
with a black man.
No.

41:21.071 --> 41:22.573
Been intimate with a black man,

41:22.639 --> 41:24.084
a "nappy-haired
little monkey"?

41:24.141 --> 41:26.178
That's a lie.
I never said that.

41:26.243 --> 41:28.052
The O'Briens were lying?
Objection.

41:28.112 --> 41:30.319
Everyone is a liar, everyone
is a racist except you?

41:30.380 --> 41:31.757
Your Honor, I objected.

41:31.815 --> 41:33.988
Yes. Sustained,
Mr. McCoy.

41:34.051 --> 41:36.691
Isn't it true, Ms. Houston,
that your son has more to fear

41:36.754 --> 41:37.960
from your prejudice
than society's?

41:38.021 --> 41:39.056
JOYNER: Objection.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.659
No, I would like
to answer Mr. McCoy.

41:41.725 --> 41:45.036
My son is not afraid of me.

41:46.096 --> 41:48.440
He knows that I love him.

41:54.905 --> 41:56.407
No more questions.

42:01.645 --> 42:03.318
It has only been
three days, Adam.

42:03.380 --> 42:05.553
Three days, 10 days.

42:05.616 --> 42:07.618
The jury is stalemated.

42:08.518 --> 42:10.657
There's always the next time.

42:10.721 --> 42:13.702
You have nothing better to do
than prosecute this woman?

42:13.757 --> 42:14.861
It's a hate crime.

42:14.925 --> 42:18.463
If that's not worth prosecuting,
what are we doing here?

42:18.528 --> 42:20.030
I've been paging you

42:20.097 --> 42:22.270
I've been breathing six-year-old
dust in a warehouse,

42:22.332 --> 42:24.972
reliving the mother
of all divorces.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.415
Burdett v. Burdett.
It went all 15 rounds.

42:28.472 --> 42:31.078
These are draft agreements
from Josh Burdett,

42:31.141 --> 42:33.587
these are from Frances Houston.

42:33.644 --> 42:36.318
Take a look at the
custodial provisions.

42:38.382 --> 42:40.862
Now look at
the alimony proposals.

42:42.686 --> 42:44.165
She's unbelievable.

42:44.221 --> 42:46.827
Get Mr. Burdett
to confirm this.

42:48.458 --> 42:52.167
You're right. That's
exactly what went on.

42:52.229 --> 42:55.005
I was traveling on business
two weeks out of every month.

42:55.065 --> 42:56.908
I couldn't possibly
take care of David.

42:56.967 --> 42:59.846
It would have been nice to have
this information before the trial.

42:59.903 --> 43:02.213
We could have impeached
your ex-wife's testimony.

43:03.173 --> 43:05.119
Mr. Burdett,
if there's a re-trial,

43:05.175 --> 43:06.848
I'm going to use this material,

43:06.910 --> 43:08.389
and I'm putting you
on the stand

43:08.445 --> 43:10.152
to authenticate it
and explain what it means.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.422
Absolutely not. My son doesn't
know anything about this.

43:13.483 --> 43:15.258
Mr. Burdett...
I won't do it.

43:15.318 --> 43:17.662
Whatever happens
to Frances or me,

43:17.721 --> 43:20.292
my son believes
his parents love him.

43:20.357 --> 43:24.169
I won't do anything
to make him think otherwise.

43:24.394 --> 43:26.305
I gave myself
asthma for nothing.

43:26.363 --> 43:29.401
We can't use these unless
he authenticates them.

43:29.466 --> 43:32.936
The jury resumes deliberations
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

43:33.003 --> 43:36.473
Call Houston's lawyer, schedule
a conference for 8:30.

43:40.510 --> 43:42.615
No bagels and coffee?
You should have told me.

43:42.679 --> 43:44.056
I would have brought some.

43:44.114 --> 43:46.390
Don't count on keeping
your big appetite.

43:46.450 --> 43:49.454
Mr. McCoy, that jury
is out of oil.

43:49.519 --> 43:52.090
The engine is freezing over. I can smell it.
They're deadlocked.

43:52.155 --> 43:54.761
I'm ready to set
a new trial date right now.

43:54.825 --> 43:58.204
And we'll hang that jury, too.
And the one after that.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.798
One more trial, and it's over.

44:00.864 --> 44:03.970
Ms. Houston, we uncovered some
documents relating to your divorce.

44:04.034 --> 44:06.139
I've highlighted
the relevant portions.

44:06.203 --> 44:09.446
When I got a divorce, I fought
for custody of my child,

44:09.506 --> 44:12.112
but you actually fought
not to have custody.

44:12.175 --> 44:13.654
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:13.710 --> 44:15.121
It's all there in
the draft agreements.

44:15.178 --> 44:16.782
Neither of you wanted custody.

44:16.847 --> 44:18.383
Your husband
for practical reasons.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.291
And you...

44:20.350 --> 44:24.025
He actually had to triple the alimony
payments before you'd agree.

44:26.123 --> 44:27.932
They're wrong.

44:28.492 --> 44:30.768
What I see in these papers
is a negotiation.

44:30.827 --> 44:32.670
Whatever meaning
you're reading into it...

44:32.729 --> 44:35.335
Was confirmed by
Mr. Burdett himself.

44:35.398 --> 44:37.810
And he'll testify to it
at her next trial.

44:37.868 --> 44:40.246
She didn't want the boy
because he's black.

44:46.410 --> 44:47.855
Josh would never
get up in court.

44:47.911 --> 44:49.288
He already agreed to do it.

44:49.346 --> 44:53.021
The next jury won't buy your
Mary-Mother-of-God routine.

44:53.083 --> 44:55.222
They'll see you
for who you are.

44:55.285 --> 44:59.563
A bigot whose racism runs so deep,
you even hate your own son.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.302
I assume there's
an offer coming?

45:06.363 --> 45:08.900
Man one,
eight-and-a-third-to-25.

45:13.503 --> 45:15.676
Well, I want to see the other
attorneys at the firm.

45:15.739 --> 45:17.946
The white attorneys?

45:18.008 --> 45:21.182
You walk out that door, Ms. Houston,
the offer is off the table.

45:21.244 --> 45:23.520
You'll be retried
for murder two.

45:27.617 --> 45:31.827
You have an attorney present.
Give me your answer now.

45:48.872 --> 45:49.942
You have a deal.

45:50.006 --> 45:51.679
We'll notify the judge.

45:55.078 --> 45:57.490
You have no idea what I
went through, Mr. McCoy.

45:57.547 --> 46:00.221
Only in your own mind,
Ms. Houston.

46:05.522 --> 46:07.263
You're lucky she didn't
call your bluff.

46:07.324 --> 46:09.304
About Burdett testifying?

46:09.359 --> 46:10.963
You don't feel bad
about lying to her?

46:11.027 --> 46:12.563
She got off easy.

46:12.629 --> 46:15.974
Burdett's lie cost her 20 years.
Mine only cost her eight.
