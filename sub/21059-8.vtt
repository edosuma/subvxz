She has a husband in the British army.

00:07.033 --> 00:09.033
We need to know who else
she's working with.

00:09.605 --> 00:11.605
You have more friends
in the city than you may know.

00:11.838 --> 00:13.809
Simcoe knows you're Culper.

00:13.810 --> 00:16.003
His father was killed by rebels.
He joined up for revenge.

00:16.003 --> 00:17.598
- What was his name?
- Woodhull.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.497
It will be on the field that we
truly settle our account.

00:20.498 --> 00:23.273
He thanked me for giving up my friend!

00:23.444 --> 00:26.435
We've received emergency orders
to leave for Virginia tonight.

00:26.435 --> 00:27.467
Virginia?

00:27.468 --> 00:29.729
Finally we'll meet
the bloody rebels in combat.

03:30.569 --> 03:32.537
If I may offer
an opinion, Your Excellency,

03:32.571 --> 03:34.273
it seems the British are moving south.

03:34.306 --> 03:36.942
- Should we not respond in kind?
- If Arnold is in Virginia,

03:36.976 --> 03:39.578
that means that Clinton
still resides in New York,

03:39.611 --> 03:42.347
the seat of power,
and therefore still the prize.

03:42.381 --> 03:45.650
This army must maintain
its readiness to invade.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.255
Would it be possible I go alone
to aid your Virginians

03:50.289 --> 03:51.723
and chastise the traitor?

03:52.167 --> 03:53.458
What of your ships?

03:53.492 --> 03:54.693
Admiral de Barras will keep his.

03:55.086 --> 03:57.129
I require only l'Hermione.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.675
You may go, Monsieur Marquis.

04:01.233 --> 04:03.468
The rest of the forces, I need here.

04:03.502 --> 04:05.004
Sir, we must consider...

04:05.037 --> 04:07.672
As for the turncoat,

04:07.706 --> 04:09.608
let it be known that I am offering...

04:10.775 --> 04:13.278
5,000 guineas to any man

04:13.312 --> 04:16.982
who brings Benedict Arnold down.

04:17.016 --> 04:18.517
A bounty?

04:18.817 --> 04:20.278
Shoot on sight.

04:22.621 --> 04:23.948
Virginia?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.525
But I thought you planned
his capture in New York.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.094
Yes, well, then he shipped out
in the middle of the night,

04:29.128 --> 04:30.729
the same night that we were
set to grab Arnold.

04:30.762 --> 04:32.497
And now Abraham has gone with him.

04:32.531 --> 04:34.666
Well, you...

04:34.699 --> 04:36.668
well, then you need to...
you need to get him.

04:36.701 --> 04:38.703
You need to get him right away.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.372
You need to get him out of there.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.207
All right, all right, I will.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.077
I plan to leave tonight.
But listen to me.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.645
I cannot leave while there is still

04:46.678 --> 04:49.314
an active threat in this camp,
so you need to tell me

04:49.348 --> 04:52.352
if Ann Bates is working alone
or if there are others?

04:52.784 --> 04:54.019
Tonight?

04:54.521 --> 04:56.055
Well?

04:56.088 --> 04:58.790
I... I don't... I don't know yet.

04:58.823 --> 05:00.692
I just... I need a little more time...

05:00.725 --> 05:02.394
- Mary, we must know.
- Ben.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.629
- You can't go to Virginia.
- No? And why not?

05:04.663 --> 05:06.665
You are Washington's
head of intelligence.

05:06.698 --> 05:09.534
If you leave against orders, you'll be
branded a traitor, a deserter.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.370
No one else knows Abe's identity.

05:11.403 --> 05:12.604
No one else knows his true allegiance.

05:12.637 --> 05:14.406
I'm the only one who can vouch for him.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.508
- What other choice do I have?
- Caleb. What about Caleb?

05:16.541 --> 05:17.727
Caleb, he...

05:18.210 --> 05:19.711
No.

05:19.744 --> 05:21.580
He nearly botched
the mission with Champe.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.759
He was so drunk the night
that we were set to take Arnold.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.679
Simcoe has gotten into his head.

05:28.487 --> 05:31.556
As long as you treat him
as a broken man,

05:31.590 --> 05:33.017
he will be broken.

05:33.558 --> 05:35.603
Give him your trust as a friend,

05:36.161 --> 05:37.647
and he will earn it back.

05:39.107 --> 05:40.692
You're right.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.535
I am still head of intelligence.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.365
I'll have to resign my post.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.110
You have one more day
to tell me about Bates.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.544
Then I arrest her.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.077
Ah, Woodhull.

06:33.818 --> 06:37.589
You have some experience
processing colonial goods

06:37.622 --> 06:38.857
through our bureaucracies?

06:38.890 --> 06:40.859
Giving it all a proper appearance?

06:40.892 --> 06:42.629
That's a way of putting it, sir.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.298
Here's a list of the goods

06:46.331 --> 06:48.300
that I've collected during
our time in Virginia.

06:52.055 --> 06:53.572
Rice...

06:53.605 --> 06:55.350
sundries...

06:56.308 --> 06:58.829
- Wine, clothing, and tobacco.
- Several ships' worth.

06:58.862 --> 07:00.169
And the munitions powder

07:00.202 --> 07:02.381
I saw your men pouring into the river?

07:02.414 --> 07:04.216
- Colonel.
- General.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.418
Better to dispose of it
than to leave it for the enemy.

07:06.451 --> 07:07.719
We've no room to transport.

07:07.752 --> 07:09.388
What, with so many ships being filled

07:09.421 --> 07:11.324
with your newly acquired tobacco?

07:12.391 --> 07:14.826
I believe you know Private
Woodhull from Setauket?

07:14.859 --> 07:16.162
Yes.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.791
I was sorry to hear about your father.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.768
Major Dundas informed me of your plan

07:23.802 --> 07:25.537
to push further south.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.406
Clinton stipulated
that I consult you both

07:27.439 --> 07:28.607
on matters of consequence.

07:28.640 --> 07:29.874
Consider yourself consulted.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.177
You might want to let the men rest, sir.

07:32.211 --> 07:33.388
Rest?

07:33.878 --> 07:36.281
Is that John Graves Simcoe
just came in through the door?

07:36.315 --> 07:38.617
Well, rested warriors
are more effective.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.820
You lost nine men on your last march.

07:41.853 --> 07:43.455
Wheat from the chaff.

07:45.390 --> 07:49.394
The rebels are coalescing around Guilford
County in North Carolina.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.381
General Cornwallis might
appreciate our assistance.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.734
I have several prospects
between here and Portsmouth

07:55.767 --> 07:57.536
that I'm keen to investigate.

07:57.912 --> 07:59.504
Cornwallis is a capable commander

07:59.538 --> 08:00.905
and I'm sure he has it all in hand.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.874
Is this campaign meant
to stamp out rebels

08:02.907 --> 08:04.627
or enrich your coffers?

08:05.677 --> 08:07.085
Don't worry, Graves.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.021
You're entitled to your fair share.

08:11.423 --> 08:15.594
With respect, sir, I came here to fight,

08:15.627 --> 08:17.429
not to loot.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.567
Well, fortune favors the bold,

08:21.811 --> 08:23.635
as it always has done.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.771
Countless others in this army
have benefited.

08:25.804 --> 08:28.276
Am I to be the only honest
man in this war?

08:29.269 --> 08:32.811
I have opportunities here
that I do not wish to waste.

08:32.844 --> 08:35.581
Woodhull, you will find me
suitable ports to distribute

08:35.614 --> 08:37.183
and sieves through
which to funnel profits.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.250
- Good?
- Sir.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.650
Dismissed.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.121
Both of you.

08:51.830 --> 08:55.834
So, now you seek sanctuary
under Arnold's wing.

08:56.262 --> 08:58.337
This camp protects you
just as much as me.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.706
Perhaps.

09:01.142 --> 09:02.508
It's only a matter of time

09:02.541 --> 09:05.644
before we both find ourselves
on the same battlefield.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.646
- I'll be ready.
- Will you?

09:07.679 --> 09:09.448
Muskets roaring, men screaming,

09:09.481 --> 09:11.150
the senses completely overwhelmed.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.619
A trained soldier learns
to keep his head.

09:13.652 --> 09:16.324
For a novice, it can be quite frightful.

09:16.949 --> 09:19.858
And when the cannon sounds
and the smoke clouds,

09:19.891 --> 09:23.629
who's to say whose knife
is whose, which gun?

09:23.662 --> 09:25.697
Whose bare hands?

09:26.072 --> 09:27.866
Oh, I grant you,

09:27.899 --> 09:30.569
when it comes to secrets and lies

09:30.602 --> 09:32.838
you're the superior.

09:33.174 --> 09:35.474
But the field is my domain.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.819
We have got to get out of here.

09:53.986 --> 09:55.327
What about Arnold?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.163
What, you want to try
grabbing him from here?

09:57.490 --> 09:59.398
No. One of the Virginia
riflemen will take care of it.

09:59.431 --> 10:00.486
You can't be sure, Abe.

10:00.511 --> 10:02.633
If we stay, we'll be
forced to kill our own.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.271
We need to go back to our side.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.480
- Ready?
- Go.

10:16.648 --> 10:18.317
We should keep our eyes
peeled for an opening.

10:18.350 --> 10:21.287
- Let's do it now.
- Right time, we run.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.417
And I can burn this coat.

10:52.384 --> 10:55.054
Careful. You'll cut yourself.

10:58.768 --> 11:00.603
It's not that sharp.

11:01.326 --> 11:03.829
Certainly not as sharp as my tongue.

11:07.132 --> 11:09.969
I wanted to apologize
for speaking to you

11:10.002 --> 11:12.137
the way I did when you brought me here

11:12.171 --> 11:14.606
and for the general manner
in which I've treated you.

11:14.639 --> 11:16.909
My comments were made in anger,

11:16.942 --> 11:19.144
for fear of Abe's safety.

11:20.445 --> 11:21.847
Yeah, I know.

11:24.616 --> 11:27.152
Did you know that Abe's
been shipped to Virginia?

11:37.930 --> 11:40.933
You have to go and get him, Caleb.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.436
I can't.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.940
I'm not the same man I was.

11:48.526 --> 11:50.175
The man you are

11:50.209 --> 11:52.377
is a man who will do
anything for his friends.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.980
Even I know that. All those
years you came to his aid...

11:55.014 --> 11:57.216
I can't ride, Mary.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.519
I can't shoot.
I can't even throw me axe.

12:01.122 --> 12:03.088
"Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,

12:03.122 --> 12:05.057
believing, ye shall receive."

12:05.090 --> 12:06.458
Never been one for Scripture.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.633
Ye shall receive.

12:19.304 --> 12:21.306
Since the Setauket route has closed,

12:21.340 --> 12:25.010
we've had Mulligan's man Cato
smuggling the information.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.148
You may want to consider
him in place of 725.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.416
Are you sure you have to do this?

12:31.986 --> 12:33.585
Culper needs my help.

12:33.618 --> 12:36.188
You'd do the same thing for a friend.

12:36.221 --> 12:37.990
Come in.

12:39.491 --> 12:42.461
Major Tallmadge,
a Lieutenant Brewster for you.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.602
Colonel Hamilton. Ahem, Major Tallmadge.

12:51.797 --> 12:54.573
The time has come for me to...

12:56.510 --> 12:58.277
resign my commission.

13:01.086 --> 13:04.089
I, uh... I understand.

13:09.929 --> 13:12.397
Thank you for your service,
Lieutenant Brewster.

13:12.431 --> 13:14.266
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you.

13:15.411 --> 13:18.070
May I inquire as to your future plans?

13:18.103 --> 13:19.415
Uh...

13:20.239 --> 13:22.908
actually, I was thinking
of heading south.

13:24.476 --> 13:26.923
See if I can't find
a friend of mine down there.

13:28.113 --> 13:32.517
He's a farmer and having
trouble bringing in his crop.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.021
Thought I might go lend a hand.

13:51.470 --> 13:54.173
- Clear a path, men.
- Clear a path!

13:55.535 --> 13:57.042
Single file!

13:57.076 --> 13:58.577
Clear the way!

14:02.247 --> 14:03.883
Cornwallis.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.951
The army won't be but a mile behind.

14:07.052 --> 14:09.054
Go pack up your tents!

14:09.088 --> 14:10.589
We've a lot of room to make!

14:21.100 --> 14:22.467
With all these new faces,

14:22.501 --> 14:24.436
this would be a perfect time to run.

14:26.941 --> 14:28.640
Traded a dragoon.

14:28.673 --> 14:30.575
Said he took 'em off a couple
of those French marines,

14:30.609 --> 14:32.644
ones that came down
with that Marquis fellow.

14:32.677 --> 14:35.180
Figure it'd easier to run
with these than a Brown Bess.

14:35.214 --> 14:37.416
The Frenchman's on a boat at Head of Elk

14:37.449 --> 14:40.052
less than a night's ride away.

14:40.085 --> 14:41.553
Good timing, too.

14:41.586 --> 14:44.156
I hear your rebel friends
are about to make a stand.

14:45.357 --> 14:46.425
No, no, no.

14:49.361 --> 14:52.164
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No!

14:52.197 --> 14:54.133
- Stop.
- I want to go with you.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.035
No, no. Let him speak.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.603
I don't care what side you're on.

14:58.637 --> 15:00.099
Please.

15:00.639 --> 15:01.974
I need to get out of here.

15:02.007 --> 15:04.143
- Coward.
- Right.

15:04.176 --> 15:08.149
I'm certainly not a soldier.
I never have been.

15:09.248 --> 15:10.943
Woodhull knows that.

15:12.017 --> 15:14.253
Look, he could've just turned us in.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.488
He just wants to be done
with this war, that's it.

15:23.595 --> 15:26.331
We go at sundown, no delay.

15:30.702 --> 15:32.204
I've already written Clinton

15:32.237 --> 15:33.973
to request more reinforcements.

15:34.006 --> 15:35.674
Our best hope of maintaining the colony

15:35.707 --> 15:37.442
is to seize control of any of the depots

15:37.476 --> 15:39.011
where they might try to resupply.

15:39.044 --> 15:41.180
Petersburg is the depot for both state

15:41.213 --> 15:42.982
and Continental forces.

15:43.015 --> 15:46.518
Exactly, scouts report
Greene and Muhlenberg

15:46.551 --> 15:49.989
have set up a defensive bulwark
here in this town just east.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.524
- Blandford.
- Where we strike.

15:52.557 --> 15:54.393
If we have the numbers.

15:57.729 --> 15:59.364
I've been drinking a lot.

16:16.581 --> 16:18.217
Can I get one of those?

16:45.577 --> 16:48.647
Make way! Move! Move!

16:48.680 --> 16:50.615
General, movement on the line.

16:50.649 --> 16:52.551
We think it's deserters.

16:55.220 --> 16:59.358
You all right? You all right?

16:59.391 --> 17:00.692
We have to go.

17:00.725 --> 17:04.063
Come on. Come on. We have to go.

17:04.096 --> 17:06.765
Go! Go! We have to go. We have to go.

17:06.798 --> 17:09.167
We have to go. Come on!

17:09.201 --> 17:11.502
Shh.

17:11.536 --> 17:12.614
Come on, on your feet.

17:12.638 --> 17:14.673
I wish I could have
been brave once in my life.

17:14.705 --> 17:18.242
- Come on, get up.
- Catch me.

17:18.277 --> 17:20.412
No, no, I can't.
I can't, we have to hide.

17:20.444 --> 17:23.647
No. Catch. Me.

17:26.117 --> 17:28.753
- This way.
- That's right.

17:28.787 --> 17:30.222
Just do it.

17:34.259 --> 17:35.560
Hurry up!

17:39.864 --> 17:41.766
- Halt!
- I caught one!

17:59.724 --> 18:01.994
Find out if anyone else is missing.

18:02.027 --> 18:04.529
Double the guard. Make sure
no one else tries to run.

18:04.562 --> 18:05.964
Yes, sir.

18:05.998 --> 18:09.328
Desertion. What a cowardly action.

18:10.135 --> 18:11.789
Good catch, Woodhull.

18:14.039 --> 18:15.573
Thank you, sir.

18:15.607 --> 18:18.010
Yes, a fine shot with a pistol.

18:24.297 --> 18:26.703
We'll need that aim
on the field at Blandford

18:46.345 --> 18:51.350
It'll make an excellent cut.
Mr. Townsend!

18:51.384 --> 18:53.252
Here to sample the latest fashion?

18:53.286 --> 18:55.922
Excuse me, sir. Cato!

18:58.291 --> 19:02.696
Last I saw you, that fellow
was considering his suit.

19:02.729 --> 19:06.132
- Was it a successful fit?
- Problem with the cuffs.

19:08.134 --> 19:09.613
What happened?

19:10.403 --> 19:13.339
All I know is what I read
in Rivington's columns.

19:13.372 --> 19:16.175
Arnold and his legion
are down in Virginia,

19:16.209 --> 19:18.044
so I don't think
they got it off in time.

19:18.077 --> 19:20.413
Arnold in shackles.

19:20.446 --> 19:22.949
That's one account
I'd have enjoyed settling.

19:22.982 --> 19:25.685
Still, nice to see you out
from behind the counter.

19:25.719 --> 19:28.256
Well, your message said it was urgent.

19:28.755 --> 19:31.290
My father-in-law, Admiral Saunders,

19:31.324 --> 19:33.845
is hiring the "Gazette" for a job.

19:34.828 --> 19:36.329
What does an admiral need printed?

19:36.362 --> 19:38.850
Royal Navy Signal Book.

19:39.432 --> 19:42.235
Fighting instructions
for the squadron commanders.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.103
If you could steal a copy,

19:44.137 --> 19:46.205
Cato could get it to one of our friends.

19:46.239 --> 19:48.443
It's been my specialty these days.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.444
Even if we were to obtain their signals,

19:51.477 --> 19:53.412
would they be of use?

19:53.657 --> 19:55.448
Our fleet is nothing compared to theirs.

19:55.481 --> 19:57.183
But the French fleet is.

20:02.789 --> 20:06.826
What if I were to change the typeset?
Change the signals.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.995
Send different copies
to different commanders.

20:11.497 --> 20:13.132
It'd cause mass confusion.

20:15.501 --> 20:19.172
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but wouldn't they know you did it

20:19.205 --> 20:21.074
if they all came from the same place?

20:21.107 --> 20:24.844
They'd come for Rivington.
But he'd know it was you.

20:36.455 --> 20:39.453
A letter from our esteemed commander.

20:40.359 --> 20:41.995
The reinforcements?

20:42.028 --> 20:43.863
Hmm, in all his abundant wisdom,

20:43.897 --> 20:45.531
Clinton is refusing to send them.

20:45.564 --> 20:49.468
Instead, he instructs
we establish a naval post here.

20:49.502 --> 20:50.937
Where?

20:54.440 --> 20:57.543
Yorktown? He wants us at Yorktown?

20:57.576 --> 21:00.479
And all the while stockpiling
soldiers for his inevitable,

21:00.513 --> 21:02.976
titanic clash
with Washington in New York.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.285
Those two deserve each other.

21:06.319 --> 21:11.157
Sir, I implore you
to let me take men south.

21:11.190 --> 21:13.426
Cornwallis defeated Greene at Guilford.

21:13.459 --> 21:15.461
Virginia is collapsing.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.330
The battle for New York is imminent.

21:17.363 --> 21:21.161
Greene needs us now. This is foolish!

21:22.035 --> 21:23.830
Greene can handle himself.

21:24.403 --> 21:25.749
Can you?

21:26.605 --> 21:27.918
Sir.

21:34.213 --> 21:35.815
Your plan, major.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.519
Yes, sir.

21:43.522 --> 21:48.527
I, uh, I propose to take Fort
Slongo east of York City.

21:48.561 --> 21:51.164
Now, I've drafted the enemies
works, and as you can see here,

21:51.197 --> 21:52.824
- there are many...
- His opinion is wrong.

21:53.376 --> 21:55.195
You see that, don't you?

21:57.170 --> 21:58.337
Your Excellency...

22:01.007 --> 22:03.078
Everyone disagrees.

22:03.642 --> 22:06.445
The French, Governor Jefferson,

22:06.479 --> 22:07.847
even your own generals,

22:07.881 --> 22:10.116
they are all telling you the same thing.

22:10.149 --> 22:12.952
Sir, you must abandon this...

22:12.986 --> 22:16.055
this obsession with taking New York.

22:16.089 --> 22:18.191
- Obsession.
- The war can be won without it.

22:18.224 --> 22:20.459
How can I possibly win one
without the other?

22:20.493 --> 22:23.129
If we strike in the South,
then it proves to the British

22:23.162 --> 22:26.232
that we are everywhere
and that we will never quit.

22:26.265 --> 22:27.533
And that New York is invulnerable.

22:27.566 --> 22:29.068
After all this time,

22:29.102 --> 22:31.037
it... it will be an admission of defeat.

22:31.070 --> 22:33.039
Sir, we've suffered countless defeats,

22:33.072 --> 22:35.641
and yet, we are still here,
we're still fighting!

22:35.674 --> 22:38.044
And if victory can be gotten
any other way,

22:38.077 --> 22:39.946
then we should go and get it!

22:39.979 --> 22:42.215
You are making this choice
out of cowardice and fear!

22:42.248 --> 22:46.085
And you're making yours out of vanity.

22:46.119 --> 22:47.186
Just like Arnold did.

22:51.090 --> 22:52.794
You will amend yourself.

22:55.428 --> 22:57.549
No, sir. I will not.

22:58.998 --> 23:03.069
You have been blinded
by self-centered ambition,

23:03.102 --> 23:05.671
and it will be my men... no, my friends

23:05.704 --> 23:06.672
who pay the price.

23:06.705 --> 23:08.602
Get out!

23:10.509 --> 23:12.979
Ready all intelligence to be turned over

23:13.012 --> 23:14.247
to Colonel Hamilton.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.649
Already done.

23:25.992 --> 23:27.493
Boys say you surrendered your weapon.

23:27.526 --> 23:28.928
Yes, sir.

23:28.962 --> 23:31.430
I'm Major Frank Ivey. And you?

23:31.464 --> 23:33.666
Name's Caleb Brewster,
Captain Lieutenant.

23:33.699 --> 23:35.712
Second artillery, continentals.

23:36.369 --> 23:39.325
Can you prove your bona fides, Brewster?

23:40.950 --> 23:42.024
Battle of Trenton.

23:43.176 --> 23:45.597
You fellas fought
right alongside the 5th

23:46.345 --> 23:48.514
led by Charles Scott, who we all know

23:48.547 --> 23:51.717
is the most ornery son of a bitch
you'd ever hope to meet.

23:59.292 --> 24:01.394
We're on our way to Blandford

24:01.696 --> 24:04.463
to turn back Benedict Arnold's legion.

24:04.497 --> 24:06.332
So, what you're after, Brewster?

24:06.365 --> 24:09.202
Same as you. Arnold's legion.

24:09.235 --> 24:11.370
And permission to fight alongside ya.

24:38.664 --> 24:40.133
Sorry.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.102
I thought you were someone else.

24:43.136 --> 24:44.534
Colonel Simcoe?

24:45.782 --> 24:48.574
If he's gonna come for you,
it'll be during battle.

24:48.607 --> 24:52.038
I know.

24:53.212 --> 24:54.874
He's not gonna get the chance.

24:55.481 --> 24:58.336
And when we muster
tomorrow for Blandford,

24:59.518 --> 25:02.021
you just stay away from those rangers.

25:02.055 --> 25:05.343
They have guns, too. More of 'em.

25:06.425 --> 25:08.361
If you come for him, they'll shoot
you where you stand.

25:08.394 --> 25:10.515
Not before I put him down.

25:11.797 --> 25:14.019
And when you get back to New York,

25:15.168 --> 25:19.638
you tell your mother to find a way
to get word to Anna and my family.

25:21.740 --> 25:22.841
You tell 'em...

25:26.712 --> 25:28.481
it was my choice.

25:36.189 --> 25:37.790
What are you doing here, anyway?

25:45.963 --> 25:47.333
Woodhull, where are your contacts

25:47.366 --> 25:48.801
for our operation?

25:48.834 --> 25:52.305
Uh, sorry, sir,
I thought I had more time.

25:52.338 --> 25:53.672
I need them now.

25:53.706 --> 25:55.643
We're leaving Virginia
earlier than planned.

25:56.209 --> 25:58.711
- The army's leaving?
- Not the army. Me.

25:58.744 --> 26:01.447
Cornwallis is staying
to run a fool's errand.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.849
Yorktown? He wants us at Yorktown?

26:03.882 --> 26:05.818
And all the while stockpiling soldiers

26:05.851 --> 26:07.586
for his inevitable, titanic clash

26:07.620 --> 26:09.491
with Washington in New York.

26:10.523 --> 26:12.619
Those two deserve each other.

26:14.981 --> 26:16.729
Sir, we cannot establish
a position at Yorktown.

26:16.762 --> 26:18.797
We're completely vulnerable there.

26:18.831 --> 26:22.335
Vulnerable? From whom? Nathanael Greene?

26:22.368 --> 26:23.402
I just defeated him.

26:23.436 --> 26:25.804
And how about the French Fleet?

26:27.873 --> 26:31.638
Yorktown is set upon a narrow
neck of land, like this.

26:32.211 --> 26:34.813
With a few ships,
the enemy can cut us off here

26:34.847 --> 26:36.849
or here and intercept our retreat.

26:36.882 --> 26:38.884
We should move up
the James River instead.

26:38.917 --> 26:41.287
- And defy orders?
- Either make a raid on Philadelphia,

26:41.320 --> 26:44.234
or go further north, take the Thames
all the way to New London.

26:45.858 --> 26:48.794
I follow orders, general.
You might try it.

26:51.564 --> 26:55.234
Yes, I have defied orders in the past

26:55.268 --> 26:56.913
but always with cause.

26:57.303 --> 26:58.871
I can read a map, sir.

26:58.904 --> 27:01.240
I know weakness when I see it.

27:06.679 --> 27:08.481
Men like Clinton and Cornwallis

27:08.514 --> 27:10.783
are used to fighting in Europe
where supplies are no issue.

27:10.816 --> 27:13.452
But this army,
they have rations and powder

27:13.486 --> 27:15.388
enough for a march, not a siege.

27:20.812 --> 27:22.228
You pointed all this out to them.

27:22.261 --> 27:26.865
Yes. But they don't see it.
They trust their numbers.

27:26.899 --> 27:28.501
You'd be surprised
how often it's the elements

27:28.534 --> 27:31.114
that you trust most
turn on you in the field.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.240
The army is vulnerable at Yorktown.

27:34.273 --> 27:35.674
And no one will listen to me.

27:39.678 --> 27:44.517
Sir, I actually have
a few contacts up north.

27:44.550 --> 27:46.185
I think they would be very interested.

27:46.219 --> 27:47.886
In your goods, I mean.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.388
And as long as you are leaving anyway,

27:49.422 --> 27:51.551
- I could depart tonight...
- No.

27:53.326 --> 27:54.927
Cornwallis still needs us here.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.600
I'll be taking the Legion
back north after Blandford.

27:59.532 --> 28:02.764
It's just local rabble.
Will be out before you know it.

28:20.594 --> 28:22.262
Fire!

28:30.704 --> 28:31.972
Incoming!

28:32.005 --> 28:34.808
Fire!

28:54.027 --> 28:55.996
Woodhull, where are you going?

28:56.029 --> 28:57.831
We need ammunition, sergeant!

28:57.865 --> 29:00.601
We've got men for that.
Back to your position!

29:02.870 --> 29:05.072
Reload!

29:08.542 --> 29:10.544
Have a reserve line ready on my command.

29:10.578 --> 29:11.845
Nobody is to move until I say.

29:11.879 --> 29:13.981
Is that clear?

29:14.014 --> 29:16.049
That enfilade will keep us pinned!

29:31.164 --> 29:33.734
Find Colonel Simcoe.

29:33.767 --> 29:35.271
Paper. Paper.

29:38.138 --> 29:41.675
Bring him these orders
to take down that enfilade.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.043
- Yes, sir!
- Go!

29:56.690 --> 30:00.127
A flanking maneuver.
Motlow, you'll carry it out.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.929
Where are you off to?

30:01.962 --> 30:03.564
Unfinished business.

30:05.966 --> 30:08.001
Fall back. Fall back, men!

30:14.041 --> 30:17.978
We have them on the run, lads!
Press forward!

30:18.011 --> 30:19.747
Capture or kill!

30:25.118 --> 30:27.755
Run out! On me!

30:30.658 --> 30:35.128
Push on, lads! Push on! Move! Move!

30:35.162 --> 30:37.731
On the double! On the double!

30:47.975 --> 30:50.210
Back in line!

30:51.912 --> 30:55.015
Ugh, come on. Come on.

30:55.048 --> 30:56.884
Watch it, you.

31:15.603 --> 31:16.970
Culper!

31:24.011 --> 31:25.212
Culper!

31:36.123 --> 31:37.958
This way. Follow the right.

32:11.291 --> 32:12.860
Culper.

32:12.893 --> 32:16.096
Culper.

32:16.129 --> 32:20.233
It'll all be over soon.

32:28.809 --> 32:33.614
No more hiding. No more lying.

32:45.959 --> 32:47.595
Regards to your father.

32:51.331 --> 32:52.733
Ye shall receive.

33:37.978 --> 33:39.913
Come on, keep moving!

34:30.297 --> 34:32.666
Colonel! Colonel!

34:32.699 --> 34:34.101
Help me.

34:34.134 --> 34:36.737
Lay him down, lay him down.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.871
Colonel, colonel. Colonel, please.

34:38.906 --> 34:42.042
Sir, please, try not to move.
Help in here!

34:45.411 --> 34:49.149
We need help! Bandages, please!

34:49.181 --> 34:51.918
Come on, will you?
I need those bandages now!

34:51.952 --> 34:53.453
Stop the bleeding.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.929
Stay still!

35:04.064 --> 35:05.933
Bandages, please now!

35:09.269 --> 35:10.971
The army is vulnerable at Yorktown.

35:13.841 --> 35:16.343
Relax. Easy. Try not to move him.

35:16.376 --> 35:18.572
Colonel, still. Easy.

35:21.014 --> 35:24.852
Hold your hand there. You're
in shock, colonel, please.

35:26.286 --> 35:27.287
Easy.

35:53.379 --> 35:54.741
Down for a nap?

35:55.414 --> 35:59.465
Here. For Thomas. A going-away present.

36:00.056 --> 36:01.443
Going-away?

36:02.788 --> 36:05.958
I've gotten enough information
to do some real damage.

36:08.301 --> 36:10.924
And I've important people
to share it with.

36:11.964 --> 36:13.899
- What?
- I told you.

36:13.932 --> 36:17.270
My Joseph's an armorer
for the big man himself.

36:17.303 --> 36:18.514
Sir Henry.

36:19.972 --> 36:21.574
Clinton.

36:21.607 --> 36:24.243
I better go before it gets dark.

36:24.277 --> 36:26.612
You stay safe, Mary Smith.

36:29.748 --> 36:31.484
Wait, wait.

36:31.517 --> 36:33.386
Wait, I...

36:35.053 --> 36:39.925
I think... I may be onto something

36:39.958 --> 36:43.373
that the general would be
very interested to know.

36:43.729 --> 36:45.959
What was it? Say it.

36:46.465 --> 36:51.504
Something big. Can you wait
just... just a little longer?

37:04.550 --> 37:09.107
- You still working?
- Just taking inventory.

37:09.722 --> 37:11.857
Well, lock up before you retire.

37:37.450 --> 37:40.619
Signals are to be
repeated by the flag officers.

37:40.653 --> 37:42.755
An interval of five minutes
is to be observed

37:42.788 --> 37:44.823
between each repetition.

38:32.037 --> 38:34.607
An interval of 10 minutes
is to be repeated.

38:40.446 --> 38:42.615
An interval of three minutes
is to be flagged...

38:48.887 --> 38:50.656
Turn the bloody stove...

38:54.493 --> 38:55.961
What the devil are you...

39:01.033 --> 39:05.137
No, no, no, no, these are all wrong,
they're all... that's...

39:09.007 --> 39:10.943
How did you even know that I was...

39:14.680 --> 39:16.449
You knew Saunders.

39:20.218 --> 39:21.920
Father-in-law to Mulligan, yeah.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.127
You're a spy.

39:30.963 --> 39:32.998
- You...
- You will forgo your threats.

39:35.534 --> 39:37.703
If you expose me, I will make public

39:37.736 --> 39:40.800
everything I have done here for years.

39:42.107 --> 39:45.844
You'll be a punch line
if the British don't classify you

39:45.878 --> 39:47.880
as a co-conspirator first.

39:47.913 --> 39:50.101
They'd never believe you.

39:50.549 --> 39:52.451
Well, if there's one thing
I have learned here,

39:52.485 --> 39:54.186
it's how to spread a lie.

39:54.219 --> 39:56.188
Is that why you did it then?

39:56.221 --> 39:58.457
To teach us sinners a lesson?

40:00.993 --> 40:04.115
If I was a more pious Quaker,
I would have stayed neutral.

40:05.564 --> 40:06.665
Then why?

40:09.702 --> 40:12.437
Those who sit on the picket
fence are impaled by it.

40:16.274 --> 40:17.710
I was here.

40:19.432 --> 40:20.965
And I could do something.

40:22.280 --> 40:25.011
And that's as much a reason
as anyone ever needs.

40:36.616 --> 40:40.193
You... will sign...

40:40.966 --> 40:44.697
your interest
in the partnership over to me.

40:45.771 --> 40:47.072
The price of my silence.

40:50.242 --> 40:52.288
And then you'll run.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.182
What will you say of my departure?

41:00.653 --> 41:02.588
I'll make up a story.

41:19.304 --> 41:21.106
Aren't you going to finish?

41:23.876 --> 41:26.679
We've already made a hundred copies.

41:28.914 --> 41:31.049
I'll be damned if I waste more paper.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.556
Turn the stove down when you're done.

41:50.035 --> 41:51.169
Mary?

41:57.075 --> 41:58.396
What is it?

42:00.245 --> 42:01.246
What?

42:02.948 --> 42:05.069
Ann Bates is working alone.

42:06.251 --> 42:10.055
Her contact in the Royal Army
is General Clinton himself.

42:10.088 --> 42:12.660
How long have you known this?

42:13.191 --> 42:16.128
- She just told me about Clinton.
- No, no, not... not Clinton.

42:16.161 --> 42:18.096
How long did you know
she was working alone?

42:20.098 --> 42:21.700
For some time.

42:25.203 --> 42:27.216
You were protecting her?

42:28.774 --> 42:30.042
Because she's doing this
for her husband.

42:30.075 --> 42:31.376
Just like you. Is that it?

42:31.409 --> 42:33.598
We've all made mistakes in this war.

42:34.246 --> 42:36.684
But I have a way to atone
for mine if you'll listen.

42:38.016 --> 42:43.088
I told Ann that I was about to discover
something, a crucial secret.

42:43.121 --> 42:44.317
Why would you do that?

42:44.342 --> 42:45.824
Because she trusts
me, and she'll believe

42:45.858 --> 42:47.361
what I tell her.

42:49.895 --> 42:51.196
And so will Clinton.

42:54.132 --> 42:56.120
Well, what do you plan to pass on?

42:56.649 --> 42:57.917
Whatever you want.

43:26.164 --> 43:27.299
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

43:41.313 --> 43:42.781
How can I know that you are not

43:42.815 --> 43:44.049
a British soldier sent by your commander

43:44.082 --> 43:45.718
to provide false intelligence?

43:45.751 --> 43:47.452
Benjamin Tallmadge.

43:47.485 --> 43:49.021
You give him this,

43:49.054 --> 43:50.923
you tell him it's from Abe Woodhull,

43:50.956 --> 43:52.257
and he will verify me!

43:52.290 --> 43:53.926
I myself know the Christian names

43:53.959 --> 43:56.028
of several enemy officers,
and I know Monsieur Tallmadge,

43:56.061 --> 43:57.796
but I have never heard
your name mentioned.

43:57.830 --> 43:59.370
Well, you wouldn't.

44:01.099 --> 44:05.045
Has he ever mentioned
the name Samuel Culper?

44:05.070 --> 44:06.498
- His spy.
- That's me!

44:06.531 --> 44:07.773
Well, you just said
your name was Woodhull.

44:07.806 --> 44:10.042
- I speak English very well.
- Listen, I am trusted by...

44:14.847 --> 44:17.249
Wait. Wait. I am Culper!

44:17.282 --> 44:19.818
I have to get this
intelligence to Washington!

44:19.852 --> 44:24.757
I'm Samuel Culper! I'm Samuel Culper!
