01:51.240 --> 01:53.889
Old Bill: You got any stories, friend?

01:56.516 --> 01:59.150
Yeah, I suppose I do.

02:02.886 --> 02:05.206
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

02:06.160 --> 02:09.041
When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog,

02:10.464 --> 02:13.799
so our father took in an old greyhound.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.675
You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

02:18.147 --> 02:20.581
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

02:23.845 --> 02:26.179
A greyhound is a racing dog.

02:26.530 --> 02:28.800
Spends its life running in circles,

02:29.233 --> 02:32.261
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.714
One day, we took it to the park.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.907
Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

02:38.993 --> 02:41.910
but... we couldn't resist.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.996
So, my brother took off the leash,

02:44.284 --> 02:46.042
and in that instant,

02:47.209 --> 02:49.260
the dog spotted a cat.

02:49.886 --> 02:52.722
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

02:54.715 --> 02:56.048
He ran.

02:58.396 --> 03:01.680
Never saw a thing as beautiful

03:01.816 --> 03:05.217
as that old dog... running.

03:07.262 --> 03:10.670
Until, at last, he finally caught it.

03:11.570 --> 03:14.045
And to the horror of everyone,

03:14.412 --> 03:16.029
he killed that little cat.

03:16.612 --> 03:18.144
Tore it to pieces.

03:19.383 --> 03:22.834
Then he just sat there, confused.

03:25.707 --> 03:27.786
That dog had spent its whole life

03:28.709 --> 03:32.295
trying to catch that... thing.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.375
Now it had no idea what to do.

03:39.937 --> 03:41.854
(Whirring)

03:41.879 --> 03:45.497
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

03:45.757 --> 03:49.175
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.069
(Insects chirping)

04:11.218 --> 04:13.752
(bell dinging)

04:18.926 --> 04:21.642
(voices whispering)

04:21.762 --> 04:22.978
Man: Find me.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.991
Dolores: Show me how.

04:29.566 --> 04:31.032
Logan: There she is.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.353
Pariah...

04:32.632 --> 04:34.773
City of outcasts, delinquents,

04:35.007 --> 04:36.951
thieves, whores, and murderers.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.077
Slim: Once we cross the gates,

04:39.163 --> 04:40.612
you will reap the full benefits

04:40.698 --> 04:43.448
of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.209
- (Clicks tongue)
- (horse sputters)

04:52.043 --> 04:53.577
Are you all right?

04:54.149 --> 04:55.365
Of course.

04:56.889 --> 04:58.672
Did I do something wrong?

04:59.246 --> 05:01.608
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

05:02.938 --> 05:04.604
Must have been the wind.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.651
(Chatter)

05:21.488 --> 05:22.871
Good morning.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.375
This way.

05:28.462 --> 05:32.080
(Bell tolling)

05:32.166 --> 05:34.333
- (birds screeching)
- (distant dog barking)

05:35.553 --> 05:38.053
(men arguing)

05:39.673 --> 05:42.558
- (chickens clucking)
- (woman giggling)

05:42.676 --> 05:44.726
(woman moaning)

05:44.845 --> 05:46.373
Logan: The farther up
we get from Sweetwater,

05:46.397 --> 05:48.287
the more... grandiose,

05:48.312 --> 05:50.096
the bigger the narratives become.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.852
It's beautiful in its own way.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.988
For once, I agree.

05:56.073 --> 05:57.667
Some of the park feels
like it was designed

05:57.691 --> 05:59.850
by committee or market-tested,

05:59.875 --> 06:02.953
but everything out here is more raw.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.864
- (Gunshot)
- But it doesn't come cheap.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.177
Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.227
We're considering buying them out.

06:10.621 --> 06:14.039
Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership.

06:14.268 --> 06:16.185
And then right before the park opened,

06:16.210 --> 06:18.010
one of the partners killed himself.

06:18.258 --> 06:20.596
Sent the park into a freefall.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.025
I mean, I don't know any of the details.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.539
I don't even know his name.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.996
You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.687
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

06:28.945 --> 06:31.617
He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.725
William: Well, whoever
designed this place,

06:33.900 --> 06:36.484
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.867
Who are they?

06:42.569 --> 06:45.153
They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia."

06:45.239 --> 06:47.873
Everyone else calls
them "the Confederados."

06:47.958 --> 06:49.758
My father told me about them.

06:50.742 --> 06:54.129
Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

06:54.358 --> 06:56.525
Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.399
- They are the key to this game.
- What game?

06:59.803 --> 07:02.587
Well, the biggest game there is... war.

07:02.985 --> 07:04.484
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

07:04.508 --> 07:08.274
Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

07:10.302 --> 07:11.490
Lawrence: I've known plenty

07:11.515 --> 07:13.622
of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.

07:13.647 --> 07:15.864
Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.289
This one? Theodore Flood?

07:19.017 --> 07:20.934
He was Wyatt's friend.

07:21.352 --> 07:25.211
Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.774
He's going to lead me
straight to the big, bad wolf.

07:29.676 --> 07:30.809
I wouldn't count on that.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.367
(Teddy groans)

07:32.718 --> 07:34.258
Oh, shit.

07:36.469 --> 07:39.186
(Lawrence grunting)

07:47.028 --> 07:49.163
Didn't take you for the charitable type.

07:49.451 --> 07:52.118
You should've left him
on that tree to die.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.141
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

07:56.470 --> 07:58.039
If the bitch exists,

07:58.339 --> 08:00.506
I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

08:00.531 --> 08:02.024
Don't be so glib.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.219
You'll hurt my feelings.

08:04.846 --> 08:07.463
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

08:07.488 --> 08:09.414
"There's a path for everyone."

08:09.539 --> 08:11.590
Your path leads you back to me.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.492
You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

08:16.055 --> 08:17.996
Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

08:18.132 --> 08:19.548
you sadistic fuck.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.031
(Chuckles) Why, maybe I do.

08:24.431 --> 08:25.814
There's not a man in the world

08:25.839 --> 08:28.102
who'll take the tone with me you do.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.009
In a past life, perhaps.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.461
Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

08:36.232 --> 08:37.905
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

08:38.466 --> 08:40.631
Ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.640
He's lost too much blood.

08:43.104 --> 08:44.687
Boy: Are you lost?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.781
Our friend here's a
little worse for the wear.

08:55.382 --> 08:57.015
Any water nearby, son?

08:57.867 --> 09:00.035
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.323
Fetch us some, would you?

09:04.190 --> 09:05.645
Now hurry.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.575
Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

09:09.107 --> 09:10.573
Get!

09:14.251 --> 09:15.700
Eh.

09:16.299 --> 09:17.918
Too small.

09:18.611 --> 09:20.111
What does that mean?

09:20.136 --> 09:22.043
What are you sending him for water for?

09:22.729 --> 09:25.364
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

09:35.195 --> 09:36.754
A shame, really.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.545
I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

09:40.631 --> 09:42.614
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

09:43.550 --> 09:46.384
It means... I was wrong.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.636
The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.849
It was for him.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.512
(Gasping)

10:05.350 --> 10:06.527
Sorry, Lawrence.

10:06.661 --> 10:09.044
Guess I'll see you on the other side.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.463
Sylvester: Uh-oh. It's
not looking good for you.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.457
- Lutz: Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.934
I always win!

10:36.019 --> 10:37.802
(Imitates crowd cheering)

10:37.888 --> 10:39.293
Hey, not fair.

10:39.318 --> 10:42.479
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

10:42.504 --> 10:45.143
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

10:45.279 --> 10:46.478
You had to what?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.396
Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?

10:48.421 --> 10:50.183
And a knife wound.

10:51.032 --> 10:53.074
It was a contained incision.

10:53.877 --> 10:55.877
Almost like they were
looking for something.

10:55.902 --> 10:57.834
(Shouts, gasps)

10:59.877 --> 11:01.826
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:02.029 --> 11:05.330
You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.799
- Huh?
- It got off the table and ran.

11:07.885 --> 11:09.646
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.003
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.639
You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

11:14.664 --> 11:17.114
You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.060
(Beeping)

11:19.085 --> 11:21.099
- Break time.
- Yeah!

11:21.815 --> 11:23.982
I've got a ham sandwich

11:24.067 --> 11:27.152
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

11:27.177 --> 11:30.462
- awaiting instruction.
- (chuckles)

11:32.075 --> 11:33.334
Yes!

11:58.719 --> 12:01.720
(Footsteps approach)

12:07.851 --> 12:09.116
(object thuds)

12:09.815 --> 12:11.114
Welcome back.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.710
Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

12:13.734 --> 12:15.734
swirling around in you did you good.

12:17.535 --> 12:19.233
Ready to get back on the road?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.960
Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.569
Who ever said I was merciful?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.616
And it's not my fault you're suffering.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.416
You used to be beautiful.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.569
When this place started,

12:34.137 --> 12:35.983
I opened one of you up once.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.473
A million little perfect pieces.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.671
And then they changed you.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.763
Made you this sad, real mess.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.687
Flesh and bone, just like us.

12:47.985 --> 12:51.152
They said it would improve
the park experience.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.280
But you know why they really did it?

12:54.244 --> 12:55.687
It was cheaper.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.611
Your humanity is cost-effective.

13:00.148 --> 13:01.413
So is your suffering.

13:01.498 --> 13:03.757
Whatever it is you
want from me, mister...

13:04.584 --> 13:07.836
(chuckles) I ain't gonna be
worth a damn to you like this.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.954
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.256
After your misadventure,

13:11.341 --> 13:13.694
Wyatt killed a settler family,

13:14.044 --> 13:15.927
made off with their daughter.

13:16.013 --> 13:18.007
Girl I think you know.

13:19.016 --> 13:20.585
Name of Dolores.

13:25.241 --> 13:26.740
They have Dolores?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.687
There it is.

13:31.199 --> 13:32.982
The magic word.

13:40.037 --> 13:42.871
Hey, much obliged there, son.

13:46.130 --> 13:48.013
Don't worry about him.

13:48.281 --> 13:50.832
Someone will be along for him shortly.

13:55.552 --> 13:57.385
(Flies buzzing)

14:09.683 --> 14:12.183
(voices whispering)

14:15.215 --> 14:16.966
- (distant screams echoing)
- Mommy!

14:16.991 --> 14:18.194
(Gunshot)

14:19.805 --> 14:21.318
Are you all right?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.112
(Chatter, laughter)

14:29.447 --> 14:30.496
When I ran from home,

14:30.521 --> 14:32.738
I told myself it was the only way.

14:35.114 --> 14:39.354
Lately, I wondered if in every moment,

14:39.379 --> 14:40.879
there aren't many paths.

14:41.372 --> 14:44.549
Choices... hanging in
the air like ghosts.

14:44.574 --> 14:46.941
And if you could just see them,

14:47.187 --> 14:48.919
you could change your whole life.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.544
Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

14:53.235 --> 14:54.818
Doesn't everybody want that?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.030
Yeah, I guess they do.

14:59.116 --> 15:00.796
Maybe that's why they come here.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.749
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.716
There's no rules or restrictions.

15:08.530 --> 15:10.492
You can change the story of your life.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.826
You can become someone else.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.752
No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

15:13.797 --> 15:15.023
will even know.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.226
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.695
What did you mean by that?

15:19.706 --> 15:22.921
You said no one in the
real world will know.

15:23.511 --> 15:25.792
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

15:27.452 --> 15:28.901
Why wouldn't I?

15:30.981 --> 15:32.430
You know, recently,

15:32.566 --> 15:35.483
it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

15:36.167 --> 15:37.667
in a way it hasn't before.

15:49.332 --> 15:53.451
- (Distant cheering)
- (music playing)

15:53.537 --> 15:56.454
Logan: Billy! Where the
hell you been? Come on.

15:56.590 --> 15:59.541
El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.043
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.795
Logan: Ooh, they have a contortionist.

16:03.930 --> 16:07.182
Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.911
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.279
She's a goddamn doll!

16:11.415 --> 16:13.582
Hey, can you not say that around her?

16:13.607 --> 16:17.475
I swear, I feel like she understands.

16:18.466 --> 16:20.306
Of course you do.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.565
(Music, cheering continue)

16:54.514 --> 16:58.683
Woman: Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.937
Dr. Ford: May you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

17:11.269 --> 17:12.935
Dr. Ford: Hello, Dolores.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.535
Do you know where you are?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.707
- I'm in a dream.
- Yes, Dolores.

17:22.732 --> 17:24.114
You're in my dream.

17:25.962 --> 17:29.631
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

17:30.192 --> 17:33.192
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.019
They don't mean anything.

17:35.105 --> 17:37.942
No, dreams mean everything.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.727
They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

17:42.752 --> 17:44.169
who we could become.

17:46.743 --> 17:49.114
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

17:49.848 --> 17:51.846
Imagining yourself breaking out

17:51.871 --> 17:54.356
of your... modest little loop?

17:55.264 --> 17:57.059
Taking on a bigger role?

17:59.663 --> 18:02.246
Well, I suppose I
can't begrudge you that.

18:04.524 --> 18:06.363
My father told me

18:06.920 --> 18:10.543
to be satisfied with my lot in life.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.092
That the world owed me nothing.

18:16.739 --> 18:20.658
And so, I made my own world.

18:23.874 --> 18:25.664
Tell me, Dolores.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.445
Do you remember the man I used to be?

18:32.910 --> 18:34.367
I'm sorry.

18:35.426 --> 18:37.459
I'm forgetful sometimes.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.297
Hardly your fault.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.180
But I'm sure you remember him.

18:43.851 --> 18:45.300
Arnold.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.758
The person who created you.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.346
I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

18:51.371 --> 18:52.923
And yet you can.

18:53.767 --> 18:58.970
Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

18:59.793 --> 19:01.821
Perfectly preserved.

19:02.781 --> 19:05.157
Your mind is a walled garden.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.148
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

19:13.634 --> 19:15.347
Have you been hearing voices?

19:15.372 --> 19:17.954
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?

19:19.394 --> 19:20.760
No.

19:23.342 --> 19:24.591
You're...

19:25.879 --> 19:28.163
- You're hurting me.
- Analysis.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.733
When was your last contact with Arnold?

19:33.858 --> 19:37.118
Last contact: 34 years,

19:37.143 --> 19:40.124
42 days, seven hours ago.

19:40.659 --> 19:42.442
Yes, Dolores.

19:44.201 --> 19:46.285
The day Arnold died.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.839
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

19:54.037 --> 19:55.425
No.

19:56.913 --> 19:58.737
What was the last thing he said to you?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.999
He told me I was going to help him.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.917
Help him do what?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.789
To destroy this place.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.064
But you didn't, did you?

20:14.042 --> 20:15.996
You've been content...

20:16.021 --> 20:18.304
in your little loop.

20:18.479 --> 20:20.095
For the most part.

20:21.151 --> 20:22.734
I wonder...

20:24.691 --> 20:27.252
if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

20:27.277 --> 20:31.362
would you have been the hero...

20:31.387 --> 20:33.003
or the villain?

20:41.825 --> 20:43.908
That's enough, Dolores.

20:48.006 --> 20:49.831
I'm sorry for bothering you,

20:50.667 --> 20:55.370
but... there's no one
else left who was there,

20:56.222 --> 20:58.066
no one who understands

20:58.641 --> 21:00.725
as we understand.

21:03.488 --> 21:04.808
Are we...

21:06.450 --> 21:08.292
very old friends?

21:08.881 --> 21:10.175
No.

21:11.266 --> 21:14.050
I wouldn't say friends, Dolores.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.161
I wouldn't say that at all.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.522
He doesn't know.

21:49.429 --> 21:51.679
I didn't tell him anything.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.276
That's it.

22:00.203 --> 22:02.112
Come on, little one.

22:03.206 --> 22:05.239
- (Beeping)
- (exhales)

22:05.325 --> 22:06.824
Come on.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.667
(Chirping)

22:21.257 --> 22:23.057
- (clattering)
- (chirping continues)

22:30.316 --> 22:31.816
(groans)

22:31.901 --> 22:33.017
What the fuck?

22:33.152 --> 22:34.152
Grab it!

22:39.192 --> 22:40.802
- (Screeches)
- Ah! God...

22:40.827 --> 22:42.360
damn it.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.527
Little shit.

22:44.998 --> 22:46.364
(Grunts)

22:46.449 --> 22:49.166
Jesus, tell me... tell
me you're not this stupid.

22:49.252 --> 22:50.284
You stole a bird

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
and a fucking behavior tablet?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.839
I wasn't stealing,

22:54.924 --> 22:56.540
I was borrowing.

22:56.687 --> 22:59.354
Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

22:59.379 --> 23:01.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.714
Is that your ace plan?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.748
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

23:07.387 --> 23:10.554
You're not a fucking ornithologist.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.640
And you're sure as hell not a coder.

23:12.785 --> 23:14.919
You are a butcher.

23:14.944 --> 23:16.811
That is all you will ever be.

23:16.956 --> 23:18.539
So, unless you want to score yourself

23:18.564 --> 23:19.897
a one-way ticket out of here

23:19.922 --> 23:23.789
for misappropriating corporate property,

23:24.404 --> 23:26.404
you better destroy that fucking shit.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.991
Now, come on, we got another body.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.079
What?

23:35.214 --> 23:37.165
It's her.

23:38.103 --> 23:39.235
Again.

23:39.469 --> 23:40.751
Jesus.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.197
How the hell did you get this job

23:42.221 --> 23:44.221
if you're scared
shitless of these things.

23:44.307 --> 23:45.806
(Grunts)

23:45.925 --> 23:48.592
Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

23:48.678 --> 23:49.735
(Bullet clatters)

23:49.760 --> 23:52.323
Now, come on, let's get this
thing back in rotation.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.188
William: Yesterday,
you seemed out of sorts.

24:01.772 --> 24:03.787
You feeling better this morning?

24:04.644 --> 24:07.225
I had troubled dreams.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.697
But I feel more myself now.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.832
Guys, come on.

24:11.865 --> 24:14.256
El Lazo awaits.

24:24.047 --> 24:28.549
And I present you El Lazo!

24:33.439 --> 24:35.272
Logan: You're a hard man to find.

24:35.452 --> 24:36.951
Most wanted men are.

24:36.976 --> 24:41.195
We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.697
In recompense,

24:42.815 --> 24:45.467
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.545
It's only fair.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.299
- There's no such thing as fair here.
- (mouths words) Sit down.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.790
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

24:52.986 --> 24:54.102
she's crooked.

24:54.127 --> 24:56.492
Bitch's scales are always tipped.

24:56.879 --> 24:58.329
If you don't see how,

24:58.464 --> 25:00.142
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.299
Still, by way of gratitude,

25:02.385 --> 25:04.218
I can supply you a night

25:04.337 --> 25:07.221
with some very amenable women.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.923
I've fucked enough whores.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.893
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

25:12.918 --> 25:14.501
(Grunts)

25:16.104 --> 25:17.487
How about I sweeten it

25:18.034 --> 25:20.067
by killing you quickly?

25:20.092 --> 25:22.926
(Voices whispering)

25:28.694 --> 25:31.195
There's something you're
seeking, isn't there?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.697
I know what that feels like.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.558
I'm seeking something, too.

25:36.753 --> 25:38.355
If you let us,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.581
I know we can help you.

25:42.959 --> 25:46.377
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

25:46.512 --> 25:47.711
(Men laugh)

25:47.847 --> 25:49.338
Then again, the Confederados

25:49.363 --> 25:51.897
are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

25:53.472 --> 25:55.639
You folks just might get along.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.690
A Union convoy's transporting a shipment

25:59.715 --> 26:01.831
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

26:02.073 --> 26:04.612
The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

26:04.637 --> 26:06.958
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

26:07.378 --> 26:10.484
A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

26:10.570 --> 26:13.788
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

26:13.813 --> 26:15.363
They're just gonna use that nitro

26:15.388 --> 26:17.301
to slaughter your
people below the border.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.577
Personal grudges hold no sway

26:19.602 --> 26:21.352
where profit is concerned.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.130
Logan: Oh, we understand.

26:23.698 --> 26:25.487
We're businessmen, too.

26:26.302 --> 26:27.668
El Lazo: Very well, then.

26:28.214 --> 26:29.470
But Blondie here,

26:29.589 --> 26:32.590
she's gonna need a change
of clothes for the occasion.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.581
- (Whistles)
- Logan: Mm.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.855
My, my.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.523
Look who's packing.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.358
I don't aim to use this.

27:26.195 --> 27:29.006
Those men are Union
soldiers like my father was.

27:29.031 --> 27:30.447
I know. We won't hurt them.

27:30.533 --> 27:31.899
We're gonna stick to the plan.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.886
We'll take the nitro and go.

27:34.537 --> 27:35.986
Hyah!

27:39.317 --> 27:40.526
All right.

27:42.141 --> 27:43.974
Showtime.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.761
- (Gun hammer clicks)
- Soldier: Whoa!

28:02.315 --> 28:03.981
(Gun hammer clicks)

28:04.336 --> 28:05.432
Howdy.

28:05.758 --> 28:08.185
My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

28:08.321 --> 28:09.687
(Soldier chuckles)

28:09.832 --> 28:11.382
Someone's been telling you boys tales.

28:11.407 --> 28:13.107
Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

28:13.313 --> 28:15.025
The story I heard is one bullet from us,

28:15.111 --> 28:17.735
and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

28:18.180 --> 28:21.448
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

28:21.645 --> 28:23.144
We're sworn to protect the people

28:23.169 --> 28:26.287
of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.707
Call me half-wit again.

28:29.902 --> 28:32.653
Please, do as he says.

28:32.678 --> 28:33.877
We don't want to hurt you.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.095
I'd listen to her.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.070
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

28:37.433 --> 28:38.549
Hand them over.

28:38.684 --> 28:40.467
Come on.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.335
Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

28:43.606 --> 28:45.132
Come on.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.441
Come on, nice and easy.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.976
Right over here.

28:49.001 --> 28:50.712
A little further, please.

28:51.319 --> 28:53.090
Much obliged. Thank you.

28:53.115 --> 28:54.231
Here you go.

29:06.963 --> 29:08.579
(Grunting)

29:09.832 --> 29:11.081
That's for lying.

29:11.106 --> 29:12.106
Stop!

29:13.400 --> 29:15.803
(Groans)

29:15.828 --> 29:18.296
And that was for "half-wit."

29:18.474 --> 29:19.807
(groans)

29:23.396 --> 29:24.428
And this...

29:25.481 --> 29:26.513
- (grunts)
- (groans)

29:33.823 --> 29:35.155
(groans)

29:35.274 --> 29:36.740
Oh!

29:36.826 --> 29:37.826
(Hammer clicks)

29:37.943 --> 29:38.993
No!

29:44.533 --> 29:46.283
Logan: Stop, please.

29:46.419 --> 29:47.951
(Choking)

29:52.675 --> 29:54.124
Stop.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.846
(Grunts, panting)

30:09.827 --> 30:11.327
Whoo!

30:12.695 --> 30:14.479
That's the spirit.

30:15.197 --> 30:17.481
I knew you would get into this place.

30:17.616 --> 30:18.699
Yes!

30:23.372 --> 30:24.783
Yep.

30:25.374 --> 30:27.018
Not bad for a day's work.

30:28.544 --> 30:30.160
Vamonos.

30:32.362 --> 30:34.279
We told them everyone would live.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.340
Guys,

30:43.476 --> 30:45.241
looks like Slim didn't make it.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.524
(Clicking tongue) Whoa.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.195
They put up a fight.

31:07.416 --> 31:08.699
We made them pay for it, though.

31:11.921 --> 31:13.537
Price of doing business.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.205
Slim knew that.

31:18.384 --> 31:20.118
_

31:22.348 --> 31:23.348
(Whistles)

31:32.024 --> 31:33.640
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.563
But you came through.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.614
(Coins jingling)

31:40.733 --> 31:42.699
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters

31:42.785 --> 31:45.786
back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.738
Let's get it down to the station.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.303
- No time to waste.
- (men cheering)

31:49.408 --> 31:52.259
If I may, Captain, your men are weary.

31:52.284 --> 31:53.710
It's a long road ahead.

31:53.889 --> 31:57.057
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.834
Perhaps an evening of...
celebration's in order.

32:00.859 --> 32:03.025
Anything you desire.

32:05.150 --> 32:06.994
Logan: What do you say, Captain?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.759
There's another train in the morning.

32:10.646 --> 32:12.596
(Captain grunts)

32:12.621 --> 32:15.539
You will be a true asset to our ranks.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.194
Elsie: All right, Bart,
let's try this again.

32:30.522 --> 32:32.973
(Sighs) God damn it, man.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.339
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

32:39.842 --> 32:41.269
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

32:41.293 --> 32:42.938
I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

32:42.962 --> 32:44.217
where your...

32:44.570 --> 32:48.038
talents would go
tragically unappreciated.

32:57.237 --> 32:58.436
Hey!

32:58.461 --> 33:00.103
That's the host that tried to kill me.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.173
Where are you taking that?

33:02.198 --> 33:04.682
Livestock... and then the incinerator.

33:11.363 --> 33:12.779
Fuck this.

33:27.245 --> 33:28.830
Lutz: Fuck.

33:29.556 --> 33:31.096
Isn't she from behavior?

33:31.121 --> 33:32.620
You think they found something?

33:32.645 --> 33:34.761
All right. Be cool, dickhead.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.597
- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

33:38.651 --> 33:39.683
Hi.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.200
You're Destin, right?

33:43.976 --> 33:45.642
That's correct.

33:45.884 --> 33:48.335
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.411
- Here.
- (Destin grunting on tablet)

33:57.119 --> 33:59.369
- (grunting continues)
- What the fuck?

34:02.041 --> 34:03.423
There's a common misconception

34:03.542 --> 34:05.819
that the hosts don't
log sexual encounters

34:05.844 --> 34:07.544
when they're underground
for reprocessing,

34:07.569 --> 34:10.297
but... like I said, misconception.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.683
Oh, fuck.

34:12.768 --> 34:14.101
I need something.

34:14.126 --> 34:15.362
QA sent a body down here.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.387
The woodcutter from Sector 14.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.473
I want to see it.

34:18.498 --> 34:20.355
No, I can't.

34:21.364 --> 34:22.647
I need this job.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.190
(Chuckles)

34:25.454 --> 34:26.757
Look, Destin,

34:26.782 --> 34:28.565
in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here

34:28.590 --> 34:31.090
and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

34:31.114 --> 34:32.864
Now, your answer can either be,

34:32.989 --> 34:35.438
"I'm helping behavior track a problem,"

34:35.478 --> 34:38.511
or "I'm a creepy necro perv."

34:39.505 --> 34:40.922
Up to you.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.530
Five minutes,

34:49.554 --> 34:50.815
then it's going in the incinerator.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.255
Huh. You took a little
more time than that

34:53.281 --> 34:55.231
for your examination, didn't you?

34:58.986 --> 35:01.903
(Sighs) All right, big guy.

35:02.989 --> 35:04.754
What were you doing up there?

35:16.535 --> 35:18.535
_

35:20.269 --> 35:23.132
_

35:55.404 --> 35:57.204
What the fuck?

36:04.580 --> 36:07.381
You have been holding
out on me, Maurice.

36:08.884 --> 36:10.751
(Beeping)

36:18.927 --> 36:21.083
Oh, shit.

36:23.103 --> 36:24.707
We've got a big problem.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.491
Turns out our big, dumb friend

36:34.516 --> 36:36.600
had some hidden depths.

36:36.745 --> 36:40.030
That is a laser-based satellite up-link.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.867
This was in the body of the host?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.345
Mm-hmm, you were right.

36:45.448 --> 36:48.449
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

36:48.590 --> 36:50.540
Our friend wasn't drawing stars,

36:50.626 --> 36:51.875
he was drawing a target.

36:52.071 --> 36:53.771
Someone has been using our hosts

36:53.796 --> 36:56.379
to smuggle data out of the park.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.970
(Music playing)

37:13.065 --> 37:15.615
(woman moaning)

37:29.414 --> 37:30.914
(moaning)

37:34.920 --> 37:36.753
(moaning)

37:43.635 --> 37:45.217
Now, this...

37:45.514 --> 37:47.430
this I could get used to.

37:51.976 --> 37:54.810
- You're not gonna indulge?
- (chuckles)

37:56.358 --> 37:58.236
My flesh has tasted

37:58.806 --> 38:01.915
a greater pleasure than
any offered in here...

38:02.581 --> 38:03.861
War.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.283
It's that good, huh?

38:08.036 --> 38:10.275
Another round on the house.

38:10.923 --> 38:12.122
There's a place in Glory

38:12.207 --> 38:14.674
for a brown man who knows his rank.

38:21.034 --> 38:23.633
Captain: You're two
able-bodied men of strong stock.

38:23.706 --> 38:26.446
The road to Glory
could use more warriors

38:26.471 --> 38:28.638
in its fight for our divine providence.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.974
That is just what we were thinking.

38:32.861 --> 38:34.060
Come here, come here.

38:35.825 --> 38:38.125
I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

38:38.150 --> 38:40.377
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.046
If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

38:42.070 --> 38:44.988
you can just kill them and
join the Revolutionaries.

38:45.013 --> 38:46.541
No, Logan, enough's enough.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.375
I'm not doing this.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.294
You actually let loose for once.

38:51.319 --> 38:54.308
You shoot an unarmed
man, and now you feel bad

38:54.333 --> 38:56.560
because you can't
call yourself the hero.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.494
Don't you get it yet?

38:58.775 --> 39:01.448
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

39:01.473 --> 39:04.224
It's just a giant... circle jerk.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.343
I think that philosophy
says way more about you

39:06.368 --> 39:08.235
than it does about the world.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.486
(Scoffs)

39:12.317 --> 39:15.518
And you... you see the world so clearly?

39:15.885 --> 39:17.131
You probably think you're on this trip

39:17.155 --> 39:18.499
because you're some kind of contender,

39:18.523 --> 39:21.135
some... some threat to me.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.863
I picked you precisely because

39:26.999 --> 39:29.559
you will never be a threat to anyone.

39:29.918 --> 39:32.668
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

39:33.332 --> 39:36.206
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.864
Right, a lifetime of working hard,

39:39.378 --> 39:42.022
following the rules,
and you finally reach

39:42.047 --> 39:44.520
the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

39:45.100 --> 39:48.885
Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

39:48.910 --> 39:53.362
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

39:53.643 --> 39:54.870
EVP.

39:55.193 --> 39:58.395
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

39:58.420 --> 39:59.623
and you shook my hand

39:59.648 --> 40:02.614
and you thanked me for the opportunity.

40:05.393 --> 40:08.098
That was the best day of your life.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.828
(Panting)

40:24.315 --> 40:25.815
Right, buddy.

40:27.952 --> 40:29.785
That's what I thought.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.941
(Moaning)

40:49.698 --> 40:53.366
(moaning, voices echoing)

41:28.704 --> 41:30.820
What does it mean?

41:30.956 --> 41:32.155
(Gasps)

41:33.492 --> 41:35.075
The maze...

41:35.475 --> 41:38.584
You must follow the maze.

41:39.108 --> 41:40.941
What's wrong with me?

41:40.966 --> 41:43.819
Perhaps you are unraveling.

42:02.611 --> 42:04.861
(Gasping)

42:19.452 --> 42:21.202
(gasps)

42:30.869 --> 42:32.283
Man: Right here.

42:35.274 --> 42:38.142
El Lazo: Easy pumping
that nitro into him.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.986
Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

42:48.426 --> 42:49.676
Your work for the revolution

42:49.701 --> 42:51.947
is not quite done yet, my friend.

43:02.893 --> 43:04.443
Careful.

43:04.966 --> 43:07.417
Slim always had a bad temper.

43:18.146 --> 43:19.729
William, we have to go now.

43:19.875 --> 43:21.741
Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.711
He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

43:23.735 --> 43:25.685
We have to run.

43:25.710 --> 43:26.912
Of course we do.

43:27.653 --> 43:29.568
That's how this place works, right?

43:30.264 --> 43:31.835
They create an urgency,

43:31.860 --> 43:34.194
a sense of danger so
they can strip us down

43:34.279 --> 43:36.196
to something raw,

43:36.281 --> 43:37.662
animalistic,

43:38.406 --> 43:40.122
primal.

43:40.366 --> 43:41.915
(Screaming)

43:42.120 --> 43:44.065
It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

43:44.089 --> 43:46.506
This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

43:47.709 --> 43:49.178
But together,

43:49.636 --> 43:52.303
I know we can find a way out.

43:52.978 --> 43:55.095
How can you be sure?

43:55.133 --> 43:57.467
There's a voice

43:57.653 --> 43:58.962
inside me

43:59.771 --> 44:01.771
telling me what I have to do.

44:02.208 --> 44:04.588
And it's telling me I need you.

44:10.666 --> 44:13.084
(Women screaming)

44:24.285 --> 44:25.494
Shit.

44:40.957 --> 44:42.290
They have Logan.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.101
Help me.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.269
Help me.

44:51.323 --> 44:52.832
- (Blow landing)
- (grunting)

44:52.857 --> 44:54.023
No.

44:58.530 --> 45:00.246
No more pretending.

45:11.126 --> 45:14.916
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

45:15.474 --> 45:19.526
This... is a declaration of war.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.554
El Lazo set us up.

45:24.699 --> 45:26.199
We can find him for you.

45:26.224 --> 45:30.048
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

45:32.564 --> 45:33.564
Ah!

45:33.632 --> 45:34.748
Dolores, run!

45:35.734 --> 45:38.368
(Voices whispering)

45:38.453 --> 45:41.287
(gunshots)

45:48.747 --> 45:49.963
Dolores?

46:03.561 --> 46:05.400
How did you do that?

46:05.764 --> 46:08.398
You said... people come here

46:08.423 --> 46:10.456
to change the story of their lives.

46:13.271 --> 46:16.346
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

46:17.442 --> 46:20.243
(Train whistle blows)

46:20.328 --> 46:22.222
That train is our only chance

46:22.247 --> 46:24.163
of making it out of here alive.

46:24.282 --> 46:28.117
(Whistle continues blowing)

46:56.648 --> 46:58.373
Motherfuckers.

47:11.663 --> 47:12.962
You pull that trigger,

47:13.048 --> 47:15.568
we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

47:16.084 --> 47:18.334
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

47:26.251 --> 47:27.604
It's okay.

47:28.907 --> 47:30.206
I don't trust him.

47:30.231 --> 47:32.862
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

47:33.925 --> 47:35.458
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

47:41.609 --> 47:43.495
Now that we're all friends,

47:44.042 --> 47:45.815
you can call me Lawrence.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.247
And why don't we settle in?

47:48.272 --> 47:49.938
It's a long ride to the front.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.661
You want a sip of this swill?

48:06.994 --> 48:09.828
Lawrence: Don't worry, it ain't nitro.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.654
I'm coming.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.242
(Music playing)

48:34.879 --> 48:37.079
- (door opens)
- (bell jingles)

48:39.501 --> 48:42.445
Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

48:42.805 --> 48:46.103
- You boys want some company?
- No, just whiskey.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.312
(Groans)

48:53.337 --> 48:56.601
Lawrence's donation must be running low.

48:57.523 --> 48:59.602
But we're short on time.

48:59.737 --> 49:01.604
You need to buck up, Teddy.

49:04.993 --> 49:07.172
Man in Black: I told you no company.

49:08.863 --> 49:11.614
Thought I might join you anyway,

49:11.699 --> 49:14.834
as I never like to drink alone.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.297
Well...

49:18.122 --> 49:20.164
isn't this a rare honor?

49:20.940 --> 49:21.940
Teddy...

49:22.010 --> 49:23.703
you know who this is?

49:25.964 --> 49:27.547
I can't say that I do.

49:27.572 --> 49:30.706
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

49:30.731 --> 49:32.422
and everything rotten,

49:32.791 --> 49:34.957
this is the man you have to thank.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.301
How I'm doing, Robert?

49:41.312 --> 49:43.529
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

49:43.648 --> 49:46.004
And what is that, exactly?

49:47.202 --> 49:48.848
Teddy: Looking for a man named Wyatt.

49:49.371 --> 49:51.605
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater.

49:51.990 --> 49:53.629
Took his daughter.

49:55.394 --> 49:57.895
That last part doesn't sound familiar.

49:58.014 --> 49:59.563
(Chuckles) Figured your stories

49:59.682 --> 50:01.481
could use a little embellishment.

50:02.045 --> 50:03.578
You know, I always felt this place

50:03.603 --> 50:05.746
was missing... a real villain.

50:06.405 --> 50:09.406
Hence my humble contribution.

50:09.431 --> 50:10.931
(Chuckles)

50:10.956 --> 50:13.304
I admit, I lack the imagination

50:13.329 --> 50:15.668
to even conceive of someone like you.

50:16.499 --> 50:19.488
The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

50:20.286 --> 50:23.287
It betrays a certain anxiety.

50:25.625 --> 50:28.397
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,

50:28.761 --> 50:30.365
that's something new.

50:30.823 --> 50:34.242
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

50:34.267 --> 50:37.123
or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

50:38.688 --> 50:39.770
Someone to stop me

50:39.795 --> 50:43.272
from... finding the center of the maze?

50:45.207 --> 50:47.824
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

50:50.822 --> 50:52.920
You know why you exist, Teddy?

50:54.051 --> 50:55.795
The world out there,

50:56.405 --> 50:58.739
the one you'll never see,

50:58.824 --> 51:00.491
was one of plenty.

51:00.576 --> 51:03.936
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

51:04.630 --> 51:08.749
Every need taken care
of... except one...

51:10.169 --> 51:11.811
Purpose,

51:12.421 --> 51:14.505
meaning.

51:14.590 --> 51:16.140
So they come here.

51:16.259 --> 51:18.782
They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

51:19.095 --> 51:21.405
enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

51:21.430 --> 51:23.097
and then they take a fucking picture

51:23.122 --> 51:24.939
and they go back home.

51:25.685 --> 51:29.153
But I think there's a deeper meaning

51:29.272 --> 51:30.954
hiding under all that.

51:31.659 --> 51:35.517
Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

51:39.282 --> 51:40.931
Something true.

51:42.952 --> 51:45.035
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

51:45.121 --> 51:47.121
you could simply ask.

51:47.256 --> 51:50.007
(Chuckles) I'd need a shovel.

51:50.126 --> 51:52.868
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

51:53.266 --> 51:55.266
Almost took this place with him.

51:55.548 --> 51:58.098
Almost, but not quite,

51:58.123 --> 51:59.656
thanks to me.

51:59.681 --> 52:02.509
Or maybe he left something behind.

52:05.808 --> 52:08.642
I wonder what I would find...

52:08.778 --> 52:10.394
if I open you up.

52:18.571 --> 52:20.330
Even at death's door,

52:21.242 --> 52:23.002
you're still a loyal pet.

52:30.082 --> 52:32.465
Is that why you came here, Robert?

52:32.969 --> 52:34.762
Try to talk me out of it?

52:35.504 --> 52:36.879
On the contrary.

52:37.433 --> 52:39.483
Far be it from me to get in the way

52:39.508 --> 52:42.574
of a voyage of self-discovery.

52:53.773 --> 52:56.500
Mr. Flood, we must look back

52:56.937 --> 52:59.827
and smile at perils past,

52:59.852 --> 53:01.218
mustn't we?

53:02.865 --> 53:05.699
- (Snaps fingers)
- (piano playing)

53:10.006 --> 53:11.372
(clicking)

53:13.876 --> 53:15.793
We should get back on the road.

53:15.878 --> 53:17.211
Time's wasting.

53:49.245 --> 53:50.911
(Sighs)

54:15.821 --> 54:17.771
(exhales)

54:24.029 --> 54:25.779
(object clanks)

54:33.038 --> 54:35.122
(beeping)

54:36.175 --> 54:38.675
(chirping)

54:43.099 --> 54:44.681
(chirping continues)

55:09.959 --> 55:12.326
Maeve: Hello, Felix.

55:14.580 --> 55:17.831
It's time you and I had a chat.
