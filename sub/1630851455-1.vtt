00:05.207 --> 00:06.207
(Episode 1)

00:06.207 --> 00:08.276
(How Many Bowls of Gamjatang
is a Modigliani Painting Worth?)

00:33.007 --> 00:34.206
Where's Da Li?

00:34.406 --> 00:35.917
Where else would she be?

00:40.867 --> 00:43.166
Why is the director
so obsessed with Da Li?

00:43.437 --> 00:46.077
Because without
having to lift a finger,

00:46.206 --> 00:49.007
the director gets the finest
research papers from Da Li...

00:49.007 --> 00:50.876
time and time again.

00:50.876 --> 00:53.446
Not only that, but Da Li is
from a wealthy family.

00:53.446 --> 00:56.147
And we all know
how the director loves rich people.

00:57.617 --> 00:58.817
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.086
Hi, Ms. Koch.

01:33.757 --> 01:35.386
How long have you been like this?

01:37.487 --> 01:40.056
Three and a half days.

01:40.897 --> 01:42.097
Have you eaten?

01:43.227 --> 01:44.296
Oh, right.

01:46.067 --> 01:48.097
You're surviving on sweets again?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.367
Well, science says that
humans store...

01:51.367 --> 01:54.946
about 160,000 calories
in their body.

01:54.977 --> 01:57.677
If you calculate that
the average human requires...

01:57.677 --> 02:00.847
about 1,600 calories per day,
this means...

02:00.847 --> 02:03.647
we can survive at least
three months on stored energy.

02:03.647 --> 02:07.617
On top of that, if you consume
enough liquids and salt...

02:08.556 --> 02:12.296
How many times must I tell you
that this museum is not a library?

02:14.157 --> 02:15.766
As director of this museum,

02:15.766 --> 02:17.727
I cannot have people accusing me of...

02:17.727 --> 02:20.437
neglecting my employees
to the point of...

02:20.467 --> 02:22.366
overworking them to death.

02:22.766 --> 02:26.736
Go home,
eat something real, and go to bed.

02:26.937 --> 02:28.946
But Ms. Koch...

02:28.946 --> 02:32.477
No books. No papers. No tablet.

02:32.877 --> 02:33.977
Just sleep.

02:35.747 --> 02:36.886
Even if I'm not sleepy at all?

02:36.886 --> 02:38.356
Even if you're not sleepy at all.

02:40.157 --> 02:44.087
This is so unfair.

02:44.087 --> 02:45.627
This is...

02:52.736 --> 02:55.437
Don't come into work tomorrow.
Go to this address.

02:55.636 --> 02:57.736
I have to pick up
an important guest from the airport,

02:57.736 --> 02:59.377
so I'm going to be a little late.

03:00.106 --> 03:03.507
Our VVVIP patron is hosting this party,

03:03.507 --> 03:06.377
so please, put your best foot forward.

03:07.217 --> 03:09.787
I am sure Sylvie
would want to go more than me.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.516
This is not a party
that you can go to...

03:12.516 --> 03:14.317
simply because you want to.

03:14.717 --> 03:18.027
This is a party that is hosted
by rich ladies...

03:18.057 --> 03:20.527
who invite their rich lady friends
to show them,

03:20.527 --> 03:21.896
"Look at what I have."

03:25.467 --> 03:26.636
And who knows?

03:26.636 --> 03:28.307
Maybe you'll see
a Modigliani you love...

03:28.307 --> 03:29.937
in that place that you hate.

03:30.206 --> 03:32.106
Really? Are you serious?

03:32.106 --> 03:34.136
Bronckhorst has a Modigliani?

03:34.136 --> 03:37.206
But Modigliani hasn't been
in the market for years.

03:37.407 --> 03:38.516
Where did she get it?

03:42.587 --> 03:44.747
(Episode 1)

04:19.687 --> 04:23.256
If it wasn't for Modigliani,
I'd never go to that party.

04:23.626 --> 04:25.227
They're too busy flaunting
their money...

04:25.227 --> 04:26.796
to care about the party.

04:27.157 --> 04:28.597
Still,

04:28.926 --> 04:31.126
you need to meet
all sorts of people...

04:31.126 --> 04:32.767
to broaden your horizons.

04:33.267 --> 04:35.837
Because the most precious things...

04:35.837 --> 04:38.436
- are in this world.
- Are in this world.

04:43.087 --> 04:44.116
By the way,

04:45.217 --> 04:47.917
what have you been munching on?

04:48.727 --> 04:49.787
Are you having chips?

04:50.957 --> 04:54.157
Da Li, have you been studying
and skipping your meals?

04:54.457 --> 04:56.227
How many days
did you starve this time?

04:56.227 --> 04:57.827
I didn't starve.

04:57.827 --> 04:59.967
Don't lie.

05:00.537 --> 05:04.306
A true adult never skips meals
or loses sleep.

05:05.006 --> 05:07.106
Didn't I tell you numerous times...

05:07.106 --> 05:10.676
to set an alarm
so that you won't forget to eat?

05:11.277 --> 05:13.217
Who cares
if you're the youngest student...

05:13.217 --> 05:14.417
to receive a doctorate...

05:14.417 --> 05:16.717
if you can't even eat properly?

05:18.116 --> 05:19.686
Is there no food?

05:19.686 --> 05:21.316
I'm sure there is.

05:21.556 --> 05:24.756
I'm sure Ms. Prinsen bought
some food.

05:25.527 --> 05:27.256
It feels like I'm in Korea.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.027
What?

05:29.227 --> 05:32.796
Hearing you nag makes me feel like
I'm home right now.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.967
You little brat.
Don't change the subject.

05:38.267 --> 05:40.037
I miss you, Dad.

05:40.736 --> 05:42.577
It's been way too long, hasn't it?

05:43.077 --> 05:45.647
Goodness.
Don't pretend to miss me...

05:45.647 --> 05:47.977
when you can't
even eat properly. Goodness.

05:49.917 --> 05:54.157
Speaking of which,
I'm planning to make time.

05:55.327 --> 05:58.126
I'd like to say hi to Director Koch.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.796
But most of all,
I need to check on you.

06:02.727 --> 06:06.037
Once this exhibition is over...
What?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.296
Hello?

06:09.407 --> 06:12.037
(Korean Pig)

06:12.037 --> 06:13.106
(Berkshire)

06:13.106 --> 06:14.137
(Duroc)

06:14.137 --> 06:15.207
(Yorkshire)

06:15.207 --> 06:17.106
(Dondon F and B FW Season
New Menu Exhibition)

06:55.887 --> 06:58.986
This premium gamjatang
has been created to be served...

06:58.986 --> 07:00.616
at five-star hotels.

07:01.017 --> 07:05.426
I can assure you that this dish...

07:05.626 --> 07:07.957
will satisfy our hotel guests...

07:08.866 --> 07:10.097
who have sophisticated palates.

07:14.137 --> 07:15.566
The meat tastes different.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.506
I knew it.
You have a discerning palate.

07:21.907 --> 07:25.316
We handpicked the best cuts
from Iberian pigs,

07:25.316 --> 07:27.946
one of the four
best dishes worldwide,

07:27.946 --> 07:31.116
so that it'd be a premium dish...

07:31.116 --> 07:34.116
that's suitable
for five-star hotels.

07:35.426 --> 07:36.727
I see.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.657
While eating this,

07:38.926 --> 07:42.897
I felt like I was a matador,
fighting for his life...

07:42.897 --> 07:44.696
under the hot, burning sun.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.667
I knew it.

07:47.736 --> 07:48.967
Here you go.

07:48.967 --> 07:53.207
This is fried rice
that is given as a dessert.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.876
The regular fried rice
can't hold a candle to this.

07:55.876 --> 07:59.816
Instead of using flying fish roe,
I used Russian caviar...

07:59.816 --> 08:02.517
and cooked it on high heat.

08:02.717 --> 08:04.246
This is unbelievable.

08:04.246 --> 08:06.787
Do you mean this is the same caviar
Russians use...

08:06.787 --> 08:09.186
when cooking food
for their ancestors?

08:09.186 --> 08:11.287
This is the most sophisticated
Korean dish...

08:11.287 --> 08:13.296
that we can share with the world.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.566
What a load of garbage.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.637
A load of... Sorry?

08:24.006 --> 08:25.066
Tell me.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.077
How much will this cost?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.246
The cost...

08:33.316 --> 08:37.746
Befitting the terms "premium"
and "five-star hotels,"

08:38.787 --> 08:40.116
a medium size...

08:41.287 --> 08:42.386
will cost 180 dollars.

08:43.386 --> 08:44.456
A hundred eighty...

08:47.826 --> 08:48.826
Sorry?

08:52.267 --> 08:53.336
A hundred eighty dollars?

08:56.107 --> 08:59.777
I don't think you understand.

08:59.777 --> 09:02.946
Iberian pig and Russian caviar...

09:02.946 --> 09:05.747
are quite expensive so...

09:21.796 --> 09:23.296
What is gamjatang?

09:24.096 --> 09:28.667
It's a filling, inexpensive dish
for regular people.

09:30.066 --> 09:31.407
That's what it is.

09:34.277 --> 09:37.546
Inexpensive, plentiful, and filling!

09:40.046 --> 09:41.046
That's what it needs to be.

09:42.346 --> 09:43.816
Iberian pig? Caviar?

09:45.757 --> 09:48.316
Why do we need to be reminded
of Spain and matadors...

09:48.316 --> 09:50.627
while eating this?

09:52.196 --> 09:55.796
It was an artistic way
of explaining the taste.

10:00.696 --> 10:02.936
What a load of garbage.

10:03.706 --> 10:04.737
It really isn't...

10:09.576 --> 10:10.576
Come on.

10:12.517 --> 10:15.316
I didn't postpone
my business trip...

10:15.316 --> 10:16.987
to hear such load of garbage.

10:17.546 --> 10:20.816
This business trip is worth
20 million dollars.

10:21.657 --> 10:22.657
Understand?

10:25.127 --> 10:27.627
Give me my money's worth.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.627
Please!

10:32.037 --> 10:33.096
Gosh.

10:35.196 --> 10:36.507
Darn it.

10:50.686 --> 10:52.586
An attendant will be waiting for you
when you land,

10:52.586 --> 10:54.157
so you won't have to do anything.

10:54.157 --> 10:55.686
The team and I will depart...

10:55.686 --> 10:57.186
as soon as
the legal advice is carried out.

10:58.387 --> 10:59.456
By the way,

11:01.255 --> 11:02.685
about that tzar...

11:03.696 --> 11:07.037
What gives that scumbag the right
to have the caviar all to himself?

11:08.497 --> 11:12.706
He's not a scumbag.
He's the Russian emperor.

11:14.836 --> 11:17.206
I see. The Russian emperor.

11:19.617 --> 11:21.517
You could've just said
"Russian emperor."

11:21.517 --> 11:24.117
Did you want to show off
by using English?

11:25.186 --> 11:26.816
It's Russian, not English.

11:27.716 --> 11:31.326
I know. I know that.
Don't take it so literally.

11:31.326 --> 11:33.657
He's the Russian emperor,
so of course, it's a Russian word,

11:33.657 --> 11:34.696
not English.

11:34.956 --> 11:37.726
"Tzar!" It sounds Russian.

11:38.066 --> 11:39.497
It also sounds the same in English.

11:40.936 --> 11:41.997
By the way,

11:42.936 --> 11:45.066
will you be wearing that watch?

11:45.576 --> 11:46.936
You'll have to declare at customs.

11:46.936 --> 11:48.846
And it's very expensive.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.007
What are you talking about?

11:51.346 --> 11:54.216
Luxury items should be worn
at times like this.

11:54.216 --> 11:57.046
If not, why would I buy
such an expensive watch...

11:57.046 --> 11:58.716
when my phone can tell the time too?

11:58.956 --> 11:59.987
I see.

12:01.216 --> 12:02.226
Look.

12:02.527 --> 12:06.326
I need to wear this
and overawe them.

12:10.407 --> 12:11.836
(Father)

12:15.707 --> 12:16.707
Yes?

12:17.177 --> 12:18.917
Did you lend money
without my knowing?

12:20.947 --> 12:23.486
What do you mean all of a sudden?

12:24.486 --> 12:25.486
Hey.

12:25.817 --> 12:28.616
Did you lend money
to an art gallery or a museum?

12:29.586 --> 12:31.226
I never...

12:34.027 --> 12:35.897
Do you think I have money to burn?

12:36.226 --> 12:38.067
I'd be crazy to lend them money.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.667
Then why did Cheongsong Gallery...

12:39.667 --> 12:41.697
send you a chamber pot?

12:41.697 --> 12:44.366
When I asked, they said it was
a token of gratitude for the loan.

12:44.636 --> 12:46.907
Gosh.
I didn't ask them for anything.

12:48.336 --> 12:50.277
Whatever. I know nothing about that.

12:50.277 --> 12:51.876
I'm sure they have been mistaken.

12:51.876 --> 12:54.177
But you shouldn't break
their chamber pot.

12:54.476 --> 12:56.746
Let Ms. Yeo take care of it.
I'll send her to you.

12:57.716 --> 12:59.486
I don't need this nonsense.
Where are you right now?

12:59.687 --> 13:01.287
You had a tasting today
for our new dish.

13:01.287 --> 13:02.486
Are you still at work?

13:02.586 --> 13:03.957
I'm not at work right now.

13:04.327 --> 13:06.027
I'm at the airport.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.697
I'm going on a business trip today.

13:07.697 --> 13:08.827
For the contract deal...

13:08.827 --> 13:09.966
with the pig farming association
in the Netherlands.

13:09.966 --> 13:11.966
Postpone your business trip.
Come back right now!

13:11.966 --> 13:13.596
- Come back here and...
- Dad.

13:13.596 --> 13:16.067
My flight is about to take off.
I have to hang up.

13:16.067 --> 13:19.537
Hello?

13:23.077 --> 13:24.077
What?

13:30.746 --> 13:31.787
No.

13:32.657 --> 13:33.657
Gosh.

13:33.817 --> 13:35.216
You brat.

13:36.726 --> 13:37.756
How dare you?

13:42.766 --> 13:43.797
Hey!

13:45.527 --> 13:46.567
Stop right there!

13:46.937 --> 13:48.336
You brat! Hey!

13:49.136 --> 13:50.606
Stop right there!

13:52.006 --> 13:53.636
I'll go and earn my keep!

13:54.277 --> 13:56.547
You brat! You're dead meat
when you come back!

13:57.346 --> 13:58.647
Don't just stand there! Pull it out!

13:58.647 --> 13:59.716
Yes, sir.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.577
Pull it out now!

14:01.647 --> 14:02.716
Yes, sir.

14:08.157 --> 14:10.427
The receiver cannot be reached.

14:10.427 --> 14:12.356
Come on, answer the phone.

14:15.866 --> 14:16.966
A gallery?

14:17.327 --> 14:20.136
It's not just a gallery.
It's the Cheongsong Gallery.

14:20.197 --> 14:23.506
I'm sure you know that not getting invited
to their year-end party...

14:23.506 --> 14:25.336
would cause people...

14:25.336 --> 14:27.006
to look down on you
no matter how much money you have.

14:27.636 --> 14:29.907
Then why would a prominent gallery
want to borrow money from me?

14:31.047 --> 14:33.177
To be precise, it's an investment.

14:33.547 --> 14:35.577
The Cheongsong Gallery would
make a fortune...

14:35.577 --> 14:36.917
if they were to sell
one of their paintings.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.417
Why would they need our money?

14:38.886 --> 14:41.216
Then tell them
to sell their paintings.

14:41.516 --> 14:43.886
Come on, man.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.996
How much longer
do you want to be patronized...

14:46.996 --> 14:48.256
as the son
of a gamjatang restaurant owner?

14:48.256 --> 14:49.327
What?

14:49.327 --> 14:51.996
Money isn't the only prerequisite
to be in the upper class.

14:52.067 --> 14:54.266
We need status.

14:54.266 --> 14:56.236
That's why we need
the Cheongsong Gallery.

14:58.707 --> 15:01.476
So are you telling me that lending
money to the Cheongsong Gallery...

15:01.476 --> 15:03.907
will give us status as wealthy men?

15:07.246 --> 15:09.317
No one uses the word, "wealthy,"
like that anymore.

15:09.716 --> 15:11.417
It's all about the inner circle.

15:12.486 --> 15:15.756
All right. That's how you network.

15:15.756 --> 15:17.457
That's how you do business.

15:17.457 --> 15:19.457
Korea has always been like this.

15:19.457 --> 15:20.527
Forget it.

15:20.957 --> 15:23.067
I'm not interested in this nonsense.
I'm off.

15:24.366 --> 15:26.736
Are you brushing me off because
I'm not your biological brother?

15:27.836 --> 15:30.037
- Ki Chul.
- If I were his biological son,

15:30.037 --> 15:31.407
I wouldn't grovel...

15:32.067 --> 15:34.077
to you like this.

15:38.447 --> 15:41.077
It's just that this is
a great opportunity. That's all.

15:41.476 --> 15:42.547
Please?

15:53.126 --> 15:54.626
The receiver cannot be...

15:59.797 --> 16:01.136
Whatever.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.506
It was my money.
What can Dad do about that?

16:04.937 --> 16:05.976
Right.

16:38.336 --> 16:39.976
Call the General Affairs Department.

16:39.976 --> 16:41.876
And cancel Moo Hak's credit cards!

16:41.876 --> 16:44.346
Pardon? He's on a business trip
to the Netherlands.

16:44.346 --> 16:46.616
I don't care about his trip!
Just do as I say.

16:46.947 --> 16:48.277
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

17:12.607 --> 17:15.276
I told you to wrap up
before the visitors come in.

17:15.276 --> 17:16.607
What are you doing here?

17:16.906 --> 17:18.046
Mr. Hwang.

17:21.316 --> 17:22.646
Mr. Hwang.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.627
What a beauty. Right?

17:32.056 --> 17:34.556
That's one of the reasons
behind staying here...

17:34.996 --> 17:36.226
despite the low salary.

17:37.466 --> 17:41.066
Should I get jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

17:42.536 --> 17:43.536
Pardon?

17:44.137 --> 17:45.607
I'm talking about my lunch.

17:46.806 --> 17:49.177
What about you? Did you decide?

17:49.447 --> 17:52.617
Then you weren't admiring the work?

17:53.177 --> 17:55.617
Deciding on what to eat for lunch
is so hard.

17:56.486 --> 17:59.157
That's the biggest question of life.

17:59.157 --> 18:01.587
In a way,
you have a successful life...

18:01.587 --> 18:04.526
seeing how
lunch is your biggest concern.

18:05.256 --> 18:07.927
Ms. Na. The director
hasn't come to work yet, right?

18:08.197 --> 18:09.266
I don't think so.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.647
Who threw this out here?

18:35.957 --> 18:38.927
Hello.
This is Kim Nak Chun speaking.

18:41.697 --> 18:43.897
What? What did you say?

18:46.736 --> 18:49.867
Are you willing to take
responsibility for what you said?

19:32.207 --> 19:34.177
- Mr. Kim.
- Hey.

19:34.177 --> 19:35.476
You came to work early today...

19:37.016 --> 19:39.516
Wait. Did you spend the night here?

19:39.587 --> 19:41.756
Well, I had to take care of something.

19:47.796 --> 19:49.996
I said you didn't have to do that.

19:51.397 --> 19:52.496
Thanks.

19:52.996 --> 19:54.536
If you keep this up,
this might cost your health.

19:54.536 --> 19:56.367
You're getting old too.

19:56.536 --> 19:58.707
- Did you eat?
- What?

19:59.137 --> 20:01.407
Of course.

20:02.437 --> 20:03.776
That's a lie.

20:03.907 --> 20:05.046
Please go and eat.

20:05.046 --> 20:06.647
You need food in your stomach
to take medicine.

20:07.076 --> 20:08.147
You never take care of yourself.

20:08.147 --> 20:10.046
Even Dr. Han asked me
to keep an eye on you.

20:10.046 --> 20:13.016
He said stress, overworking,
and skipping medication...

20:13.016 --> 20:14.657
will deteriorate
your heart health the most.

20:14.657 --> 20:19.226
You seem to nag me
way more than my own daughter.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.627
By the way,
what brings you here this morning?

20:24.066 --> 20:25.326
What's that blueprint?

20:25.326 --> 20:28.137
Oh, right.
It's about the artist, Na Ru.

20:28.137 --> 20:30.966
The artist insisted on
hanging the artwork on the ceiling.

20:31.236 --> 20:34.877
The weight of the installation
would come out to 100kg at least.

20:34.877 --> 20:36.907
I'm not sure if our ceiling...

20:37.347 --> 20:39.847
can endure that much weight.

20:45.617 --> 20:46.657
Come in.

20:50.357 --> 20:53.957
Sir. The artwork we received
from New York seems a bit off.

20:54.326 --> 20:56.097
I think
someone must have touched it.

20:56.697 --> 20:58.197
What are you talking about?

20:58.197 --> 21:00.397
I checked everything
before I left yesterday.

21:00.397 --> 21:04.637
Oh, that. I went down
to check on something yesterday.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.337
I had a small accident there.

21:06.837 --> 21:08.437
But the artwork is fine.

21:09.236 --> 21:11.707
We just need to fix the frame.

21:12.506 --> 21:14.377
What were you trying to check?

21:14.746 --> 21:16.786
How could that happen?

21:16.947 --> 21:19.857
Gosh, now that I'm getting older,

21:20.056 --> 21:23.026
my legs just went weak
all of a sudden.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.796
I'll go and get that fixed.

21:26.796 --> 21:28.597
Can you do that for me?

21:30.597 --> 21:31.996
As for this,

21:32.667 --> 21:35.036
we should ask
the Safety and Facilities Department...

21:35.036 --> 21:36.266
at the district office.

21:37.006 --> 21:40.637
And let's come up with a plan
with Mr. Hwang.

21:40.637 --> 21:41.707
Sure.

21:43.207 --> 21:44.246
Thanks.

22:16.373 --> 22:17.413
Ms. Koch?

22:18.183 --> 22:20.612
What are you doing here?
You said you were going to the airport.

22:20.612 --> 22:22.453
I just got a call that
my mother collapsed.

22:22.453 --> 22:23.883
I'm on my way to the hospital.

22:23.883 --> 22:25.022
Oh, no.

22:25.022 --> 22:26.653
Thankfully she's in stable condition,

22:26.653 --> 22:29.552
but Da Li, I'll need you
to go to the airport for me.

22:30.123 --> 22:31.193
Me?

22:31.193 --> 22:33.592
The important guest today
is Jin Hitonari,

22:33.592 --> 22:35.663
a world-famous Japanese collector.

22:35.663 --> 22:38.032
Korean-Japanese, I believe.

22:38.502 --> 22:40.403
Anyways, his knowledge on art...

22:40.403 --> 22:42.233
could give any expert
a run for their money,

22:42.233 --> 22:44.673
so I can't trust anyone but you.

22:45.002 --> 22:47.913
He has such great influence
on the art association that...

22:47.913 --> 22:51.112
without him, there will be
no exhibition for us this year.

22:51.342 --> 22:52.913
You get how important he is?

22:54.252 --> 22:55.252
Okay.

22:55.252 --> 22:57.522
Don't worry about anything else.
Just kiss up to him.

22:57.522 --> 22:59.723
You know how crazy rich people are.

23:00.893 --> 23:02.493
Except you, of course.

23:03.092 --> 23:04.592
Oh, gosh.

23:04.723 --> 23:07.292
Here's the keys to my car,
right there.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.193
Okay? Oh, but wait...

23:09.463 --> 23:12.332
You're not going to the party
wearing that, are you?

23:20.342 --> 23:22.612
Yes. I just got off the plane.

23:23.112 --> 23:24.683
I just slept a bit.

23:24.943 --> 23:26.612
Oh, really?

23:27.213 --> 23:29.483
It is indeed far.

23:30.282 --> 23:31.282
Yes.

23:34.052 --> 23:35.953
I'm sorry.

23:35.953 --> 23:37.153
Don't touch it!

23:38.092 --> 23:40.292
Is this your stealing gimmick?

23:40.633 --> 23:43.292
- What...
- Leave it!

23:44.663 --> 23:46.602
Okay.

23:50.873 --> 23:52.943
What a temper.

23:55.512 --> 23:56.772
It was nothing.

23:58.643 --> 24:00.082
Did you buy a pair of dress shoes?

24:00.953 --> 24:01.983
Don't worry.

24:01.983 --> 24:04.252
I brought an extra pair to wear
at the hotel.

24:05.723 --> 24:06.752
But the party...

24:06.752 --> 24:10.592
It's nothing too fancy
or extravagant, right?

24:10.963 --> 24:13.022
It's just something like
a welcoming party...

24:13.022 --> 24:14.733
so you don't need to sweat.

24:15.233 --> 24:16.262
But you know that...

24:16.262 --> 24:18.832
you need to build some rapport...

24:19.032 --> 24:20.403
to make the deal go smoothly.

24:20.832 --> 24:21.832
Rapport?

24:22.973 --> 24:24.673
You know that's my jam.

24:28.643 --> 24:30.782
By the way, where is she?

24:37.213 --> 24:39.752
Okay. I found her.

24:39.752 --> 24:40.993
See you tomorrow.

25:15.352 --> 25:16.822
Are you a crow or what?

25:16.822 --> 25:18.693
- Mr. Jin?
- Where's the car?

25:19.393 --> 25:20.423
Over there...

25:29.233 --> 25:31.403
You know how crazy rich people are.

26:09.743 --> 26:11.612
My name is Kim Da Li,

26:11.612 --> 26:14.052
assisting you since Ms. Koch
had a last-minute emergency.

26:14.552 --> 26:16.383
Da Li, as in Salvador Dali.

26:18.883 --> 26:20.522
You know the candy
that Dali designed?

26:20.653 --> 26:22.493
He stopped crying whenever
he was presented with a candy,

26:22.493 --> 26:24.193
- so his father...
- What time is the party again?

26:24.923 --> 26:28.832
It's an hour and a half ride,
so you have more than enough time.

26:34.502 --> 26:35.973
Did you find the flight enjoyable?

26:38.842 --> 26:40.373
Do you really want to know?

26:41.143 --> 26:42.213
Excuse me?

26:45.213 --> 26:48.612
First-class seats
are just expensive.

26:48.612 --> 26:50.453
They're not that different
from economy-class ones.

26:50.852 --> 26:52.082
It was Da Li, right?

26:53.683 --> 26:56.653
Even if you succeed in the future,
don't buy first-class tickets.

26:57.193 --> 26:59.193
You can buy some gamjatang
with that money instead.

26:59.193 --> 27:00.262
That's more profitable.

27:00.993 --> 27:01.993
I'm sorry?

27:02.463 --> 27:06.002
How many bowls of gamjatang
can you buy with that money?

27:07.903 --> 27:10.502
First-class seats are around
20,000 dollars...

27:10.973 --> 27:12.703
Economy-class ones are
1,000 dollars...

27:12.703 --> 27:15.743
A bowl of gamjatang is 30 dollars...
So 3 times 6 equals 18...

27:15.743 --> 27:17.842
That would be 633 bowls, rounded up.

27:19.713 --> 27:20.782
What?

27:20.782 --> 27:23.312
If converted to single portions,
that would be 1,266 bowls.

27:28.153 --> 27:31.163
I apologize. I couldn't help
but do the math. My bad.

27:31.163 --> 27:32.792
No, not at all.

27:33.163 --> 27:34.663
That's the right attitude.

27:34.663 --> 27:37.502
You need the habit of calculating
every single thing immediately...

27:37.502 --> 27:40.032
not to get scammed in the slightest.

27:40.032 --> 27:41.332
If you aren't paying attention,

27:41.332 --> 27:43.572
there is a ridonkulous number
of people who will stab your back.

27:44.772 --> 27:46.072
"Ridonkulous"?

27:46.802 --> 27:47.812
Of course.

27:53.612 --> 27:55.582
You know how crazy rich people are.

28:02.352 --> 28:05.362
I heard the art association worked
really hard for your visit.

28:05.362 --> 28:08.233
So everyone has high expectations.

28:11.502 --> 28:13.963
Da Li, you are more innocent
than you appear.

28:14.703 --> 28:16.403
Do you think that expectation
is about me?

28:16.473 --> 28:17.873
It's about the money.

28:19.042 --> 28:20.943
I mean, 20 million dollars is a lot.

28:21.812 --> 28:24.383
Even if they all pretend
as if they're more sophisticated,

28:24.383 --> 28:26.282
it all comes down to money.

28:26.282 --> 28:28.153
This thing. Money.

28:28.913 --> 28:30.483
That's how the world is.

28:58.943 --> 29:01.453
This is the party venue...

29:02.812 --> 29:04.483
I heard it was at a farm.

29:04.723 --> 29:08.792
It's a modern interpretation
of a farm built in the 1700s.

29:09.322 --> 29:10.393
Isn't it beautiful?

29:10.592 --> 29:13.022
Well, it must have cost a bit.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.893
Are people in this game usually
this into luxury and vanity?

29:49.292 --> 29:50.362
Excuse me?

29:50.362 --> 29:53.262
This is more a "let me show you
how much money I have" party...

29:53.262 --> 29:55.002
than a welcoming party.

29:55.633 --> 29:58.272
And why are there so many paintings?

29:58.802 --> 30:00.572
Even though it's sad to admit,

30:00.572 --> 30:03.542
money and art are directly related.

30:03.943 --> 30:05.683
"Art." That's a praise.

30:08.782 --> 30:12.282
But Selbo Diliani is here today.

30:13.352 --> 30:14.393
Who?

30:15.153 --> 30:16.223
Cannoli?

30:17.052 --> 30:20.022
Da Li, welcome.

30:20.022 --> 30:22.163
Hello, Madam Bronckhorst.

30:22.933 --> 30:25.633
Where have you been?
You know I've missed you.

30:25.633 --> 30:27.873
Have you heard about
Director Koch's mother?

30:27.873 --> 30:30.002
Indeed, I have.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.173
I don't know whether to call it a relief.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.842
But who's this...

30:37.643 --> 30:39.483
handsome man?

30:39.483 --> 30:40.842
Oh, please say hello.

30:40.842 --> 30:43.782
This is Mr. Jin.
Jin Hitonari, from Japan.

30:45.352 --> 30:47.352
This is Madam Bronckhorst
who is hosting the party.

30:48.223 --> 30:51.123
Oh, is this the famous Jin Sang?

30:53.193 --> 30:54.633
How lovely to meet you.

30:54.633 --> 30:56.832
You know,
I've been wanting to meet you.

30:56.832 --> 31:00.233
Who would have thought that
the famous Jin Hitonari...

31:00.233 --> 31:02.673
would be this handsome young man?

31:02.673 --> 31:04.542
Why have you been hiding
your handsome face...

31:04.542 --> 31:06.673
this whole time, Jin Sang?

31:07.203 --> 31:09.842
"Jin Sang"? What is she saying?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.542
She's saying it's great to meet you.

31:12.743 --> 31:15.282
Yes. Silly me. Come along, Mr. Jin.

31:15.282 --> 31:18.052
I have so many people
to introduce you to. Come along.

31:19.782 --> 31:21.123
Excuse me.

31:21.893 --> 31:23.723
Ladies and gentlemen.

31:24.893 --> 31:26.663
Look who's here.

31:26.822 --> 31:31.562
This is our mysterious collector,
Jin Hitonari.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.272
I've heard so much about you.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.102
He is the chairman of the association.

31:37.102 --> 31:38.772
He says it's an honor to meet you.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.403
It's my pleasure.

31:41.913 --> 31:43.643
You're so sweet.

31:43.643 --> 31:45.413
Ms. Van der Sar.

31:45.683 --> 31:48.052
Do you have any free time tomorrow?

31:48.052 --> 31:49.752
She wants to know
if you're free tomorrow.

31:51.752 --> 31:53.183
She welcomes you here.

31:53.183 --> 31:55.022
It's such a pleasure.

31:55.852 --> 31:57.252
- You're so handsome.
- Okay.

31:57.252 --> 31:58.493
That is quite enough, everyone.

31:58.493 --> 31:59.792
You know, it's not every day...

31:59.792 --> 32:02.233
we get to invite
such a distinguished guest.

32:02.233 --> 32:04.193
We must take this opportunity...

32:04.193 --> 32:07.602
to hear what he has to say
about my collection.

32:07.832 --> 32:10.102
Isn't that right, Mr. Jin?

32:10.733 --> 32:13.502
She wants your opinion
on the collection.

32:14.443 --> 32:15.873
The collection? My opinion?

32:16.542 --> 32:17.673
All of a sudden?

32:30.813 --> 32:34.382
Just share a few words
on a painting of your choice.

32:35.982 --> 32:37.152
But you know that...

32:37.152 --> 32:40.922
you need to build some rapport
to make the deal go smoothly.

32:42.222 --> 32:44.293
I can never get used to this part.

32:47.363 --> 32:48.363
Okay.

32:56.103 --> 32:58.202
All of these pieces are huge,

32:58.702 --> 33:01.773
have pretty colors,
and are beautiful.

33:03.472 --> 33:06.382
Madam Bronckhorst boasts
a fine collection,

33:06.382 --> 33:07.813
full of high-quality artworks...

33:07.813 --> 33:11.783
that are no less important
than great collections seen in galleries.

33:15.023 --> 33:16.222
Among the artworks...

33:16.222 --> 33:19.162
The artworks are bold,
imposing, grand, and majestic,

33:19.162 --> 33:22.093
with a dazzling feast of colors,
capturing...

33:22.093 --> 33:24.192
and exhibiting the essence of art.

33:27.303 --> 33:29.472
- Among the artworks...
- Which, in my opinion,

33:29.472 --> 33:32.803
clearly displayed
the sophisticated feature...

33:32.803 --> 33:34.442
of the collection's owner.

33:42.513 --> 33:45.922
Among the artworks,
the one that captured my heart is...

33:47.053 --> 33:50.993
When it comes to art,
no work is greater than another.

33:51.323 --> 33:55.632
However, the one that has caused
a stir in my heart is...

34:11.141 --> 34:12.743
That painting of a pig.

34:23.123 --> 34:24.592
The picture of a pig.

34:24.592 --> 34:27.123
- What?
- A pig?

34:28.163 --> 34:30.331
- A pig?
- Really?

34:50.351 --> 34:51.382
Now.

34:52.553 --> 34:55.292
White hair, a long body,

34:55.393 --> 34:57.493
and droopy ears.

34:57.493 --> 35:00.123
They look obviously
like Landrace pigs.

35:00.263 --> 35:03.493
But as you can see,
their backs and thighs are...

35:03.493 --> 35:06.303
a little thicker
than most Landrace pigs.

35:07.462 --> 35:09.473
I believe these are
Dutch Landrace pigs.

35:20.413 --> 35:23.152
The white bristles, long body,
and the droopy ears...

35:23.152 --> 35:26.022
would make you think that this is
your typical Landrace breed.

35:26.022 --> 35:28.623
But if you look at the back
and the thighs,

35:28.623 --> 35:31.053
you'll see it's thicker than
your common Landrace.

35:31.053 --> 35:32.323
This means,

35:32.792 --> 35:36.363
I suspect, is a Dutch Landrace pig.

35:40.502 --> 35:43.102
There's something we must not miss.

35:43.102 --> 35:46.772
A special aspect of this painting
that we must not miss...

35:49.542 --> 35:51.643
- This pig.
- is this pig...

35:51.643 --> 35:53.542
- It looks very lethargic.
- right here.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.683
Other pigs are feeding on food,

35:55.683 --> 35:57.812
but it's the only lethargic one.

35:57.812 --> 35:59.183
On top of that, look.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.752
There are dirty feces smeared...

36:01.752 --> 36:04.652
in thick and dark colors
all over its anus.

36:04.652 --> 36:06.863
- In other words,
- Its anus.

36:07.922 --> 36:08.962
poop.

36:09.393 --> 36:11.933
This poop.

36:12.832 --> 36:14.203
- Poop?
- Poop?

36:16.232 --> 36:18.343
This is
porcine proliferative enteritis.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.772
Proliferative enteritis.

36:21.002 --> 36:24.542
If its feces look like this,
it means it'll die soon.

36:25.942 --> 36:27.843
- Die.
- When the excrement is...

36:27.843 --> 36:31.152
in a state like this,
it means it's on the brink of death.

36:32.623 --> 36:33.683
Die.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.953
Before it infects other pigs,

36:37.953 --> 36:39.763
it must be
quarantined immediately...

36:39.763 --> 36:43.593
to help you to suffer
from less financial damage.

36:44.292 --> 36:47.332
The owner must isolate this pig
from the others...

36:47.332 --> 36:49.873
so it cannot infect
the rest of them.

36:50.303 --> 36:53.803
That way, the owner can
minimize the damage.

36:55.272 --> 36:56.473
That's all.

36:58.643 --> 36:59.783
That's all.

37:08.623 --> 37:12.462
I'm not familiar with realism art.

37:12.623 --> 37:13.922
But...

37:14.933 --> 37:17.732
is this a Millet painting?

37:19.102 --> 37:22.272
It was painted by my grandmother...

37:22.433 --> 37:23.703
as a hobby.

37:24.632 --> 37:25.873
Oh my.

37:27.002 --> 37:28.102
Really?

37:53.132 --> 37:54.203
Thank you.

37:59.073 --> 38:00.073
Here.

38:03.212 --> 38:04.212
Take this.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.272
Goodness, I'm sorry.
You should've made me do it.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.743
It's okay. It's for me anyway.

38:37.143 --> 38:39.743
It looked like
they served good liquor.

38:40.243 --> 38:41.953
I wanted to chug some down,
then get some more.

38:42.352 --> 38:44.312
I have to drive.

38:44.982 --> 38:48.292
Right, but alcohol is
the most expensive thing here.

38:52.763 --> 38:53.993
Thank you.

38:56.593 --> 39:00.232
Is this painting that nice?
I'm not so sure.

39:02.672 --> 39:04.203
How much does this cost?

39:05.042 --> 39:08.473
If this is a genuine piece,
at least 120 million.

39:10.843 --> 39:12.582
That makes no sense.

39:12.712 --> 39:15.113
This can't possibly cost 120 million won.

39:15.113 --> 39:18.212
No, not won. Euros.
It's 120 million euros.

39:23.893 --> 39:28.732
Wait, if this is 120 million euros,
that means...

39:28.732 --> 39:31.192
About 160 million dollars.

39:33.232 --> 39:36.303
About 160 million dollars?

39:39.573 --> 39:40.573
Oh my.

39:41.243 --> 39:44.272
Goodness, Mr. Jin. My gosh, Mr. Jin.

39:56.752 --> 39:59.422
- Are you all right, Mr. Jin?
- I'm fine.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.102
My Modigliani!

40:05.102 --> 40:08.832
Oh my. Please let this be a dream.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.783
That 160 million dollars...

40:25.022 --> 40:27.123
What in the freaking world?

40:27.123 --> 40:29.522
Do you know how much this costs?

40:30.152 --> 40:31.863
You son of a gun.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.763
Just come here. I'll rip out...

40:33.763 --> 40:35.363
Wait till I get my hands on you.

40:35.363 --> 40:37.393
You little...

40:37.393 --> 40:38.803
You...

40:38.803 --> 40:39.832
Enough!

40:41.132 --> 40:43.272
What? You...

40:44.402 --> 40:45.542
Madam.

40:49.442 --> 40:51.942
This painting is a fake.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.243
What?

40:55.982 --> 40:57.812
Nonsense. That can't be.

40:58.152 --> 41:02.123
At first glance, it looks like
a painting by Modigliani.

41:03.623 --> 41:06.823
But if you look closer,
it appears to be...

41:09.062 --> 41:10.863
No, it must be...

41:11.132 --> 41:13.602
a forgery by Elmyr de Hory.

41:14.203 --> 41:15.433
Absurd.

41:15.433 --> 41:18.272
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for this painting?

41:20.002 --> 41:23.373
Did you purchase it legally
from a respectable dealer?

41:24.413 --> 41:26.542
Of course, I did.
What do you take me for?

41:26.542 --> 41:29.013
Why would I purchase it illegally?

41:32.353 --> 41:33.422
Then...

41:34.123 --> 41:36.922
may I take a look
at the back of the canvas?

41:37.453 --> 41:39.092
Unlike other forgers,

41:39.422 --> 41:41.893
Elmyr always hid his signature
on the back.

41:43.032 --> 41:47.263
If this is an authentic Modigliani...

41:56.573 --> 41:58.673
What are you guys doing? Tell me.

41:58.972 --> 42:02.343
Let me go.
What do you think you're doing?

42:07.912 --> 42:08.912
What?

42:17.293 --> 42:18.293
Hey.

42:19.193 --> 42:21.733
Do you not know who I am?

42:22.093 --> 42:25.363
How dare you mistreat me like this
for ruining a single painting?

42:25.803 --> 42:28.503
There's even a lady here.

42:28.932 --> 42:30.043
You...

42:32.472 --> 42:33.642
What was that?

42:34.642 --> 42:35.972
Gosh.

42:38.383 --> 42:41.912
The Majang-dong Fighter
is no longer hot-tempered.

42:41.912 --> 42:45.023
Back in the day,
I would've ripped out your spines...

42:45.023 --> 42:46.153
and just...

42:47.600 --> 42:48.870
Da Li.

42:49.299 --> 42:51.600
Da Li, what will happen to us now?

42:51.600 --> 42:53.870
Don't tell me
I have to compensate her.

42:53.870 --> 42:55.739
It's just a small hole.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.509
If you think about it,
it's her fault for displaying...

42:58.509 --> 43:01.310
such an expensive painting
in front of so many people.

43:02.150 --> 43:03.179
Da Li.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.020
There's even a law...

43:06.020 --> 43:07.690
that requires both parties
to take responsibility.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
Wait.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.500
Why the long face?

43:12.500 --> 43:14.099
This has nothing to do with you.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.299
I'm the one they invited,

43:16.299 --> 43:17.869
and I'm also the one
who ruined that painting.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.009
You're just my attendant.
Nothing more, nothing less.

43:20.340 --> 43:23.909
What happened today
has nothing to do with you.

43:23.909 --> 43:26.210
I will take responsibility so...

43:26.210 --> 43:27.250
It's a fake.

43:27.810 --> 43:28.849
What?

43:29.049 --> 43:32.219
The painting you ruined is a fake.

43:32.549 --> 43:34.320
Then...

43:42.130 --> 43:44.529
Mamma mia! Alrighty! Awesome!

43:48.099 --> 43:49.329
You should've told me sooner.

43:49.329 --> 43:51.139
I was worried sick, you know?

43:52.299 --> 43:53.310
Hold on.

43:54.139 --> 43:56.009
Why do you look so down?

43:56.239 --> 43:57.279
What's the matter?

43:57.540 --> 43:59.409
This has nothing to do with you,

43:59.409 --> 44:02.110
but we've lost a great patron.

44:02.679 --> 44:04.920
I was going to tell her in private
after the party was over,

44:04.920 --> 44:06.820
but things blew up.

44:07.250 --> 44:09.349
Madam Bronckhorst won't sit still...

44:09.349 --> 44:11.960
after the humiliation
she's received today.

44:12.920 --> 44:13.960
Patron?

44:14.460 --> 44:16.529
Do you get your scholarship
from the hog farm association?

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
The hog farm association?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.670
Why would they be so petty
and take back the scholarship?

44:22.730 --> 44:25.940
Don't worry.
After all, you saved my life today.

44:25.940 --> 44:29.009
Dondon F and B will give you
a scholarship from now on.

44:29.340 --> 44:31.239
We offer social service too.

44:31.239 --> 44:33.110
Hold on. Dondon F and B?

44:33.110 --> 44:34.949
What is that?

44:35.310 --> 44:37.880
It's a part of our company,
Dondon Gamjatang.

44:38.279 --> 44:39.449
I'm sure you heard of it.

44:39.449 --> 44:42.420
Didn't you say you were Mr. Jin?

44:42.820 --> 44:44.889
Yes. I'm Jin Moo Hak.

44:45.489 --> 44:47.259
I thought they had invited you.

44:47.389 --> 44:49.460
Yes. The Dutch hog farm.

44:50.599 --> 44:53.799
Does that mean
you're not Mr. Jin Hitonari?

44:53.799 --> 44:55.270
No, I'm Jin Moo Hak.

44:57.170 --> 44:58.500
Oh, no!

45:02.369 --> 45:03.540
What should I do?

45:13.619 --> 45:14.650
The receiver cannot be reached.

45:14.650 --> 45:16.349
Why isn't he picking up?

45:19.759 --> 45:23.699
Why did you take me to that party
without checking who I was first?

45:23.699 --> 45:25.699
Had you checked
my identity beforehand,

45:25.699 --> 45:27.969
I wouldn't have ruined
that painting!

45:28.199 --> 45:31.369
You're the one
who rushed us to the party.

45:31.369 --> 45:33.610
Do you take just anyone
to such parties...

45:33.610 --> 45:36.270
without checking who they are first?

45:36.270 --> 45:38.880
- You said you were Mr. Jin.
- Yes, because I'm Jin Moo Hak!

45:38.880 --> 45:40.610
I should've suspected you...

45:40.610 --> 45:42.480
when you started mentioning
pig poop and enteritis.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.980
You kept talking about pigs.

45:44.750 --> 45:45.750
Look who's talking.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.290
You're the one who said
that fake painting cost...

45:47.290 --> 45:48.820
such an astronomical number.

45:49.250 --> 45:51.520
Do you even know
how many bowls of gamjatang that is?

45:51.520 --> 45:53.659
It's an artwork,
not just a simple painting.

45:53.659 --> 45:56.529
How could you compare its cost
to gamjatang?

45:56.630 --> 45:58.529
- What a load of garbage.
- Sorry?

45:59.299 --> 46:03.130
Artwork, my foot.
You said it was a fake. A fake!

46:04.040 --> 46:05.099
Hold on.

46:05.599 --> 46:09.610
I could've paid
a hefty compensation to that fraud.

46:09.969 --> 46:12.779
You better pray that I still get
my 20-million-dollar contract.

46:12.779 --> 46:14.549
Or else, you're dead meat.

46:20.119 --> 46:21.590
Don't drive so recklessly.

46:52.279 --> 46:54.820
Excuse me.

46:55.989 --> 46:57.590
Did you see a Japanese man?

46:57.590 --> 46:59.060
A Japanese man. No?

47:08.500 --> 47:11.299
You fool. You idiot. You moron.

47:11.969 --> 47:17.710
You fool. You idiot. You moron.

47:18.210 --> 47:21.009
You fool. You idiot. You moron.

47:21.650 --> 47:23.679
You seem to have a limited number
of words to call yourself.

47:23.820 --> 47:25.119
Just get up.

47:28.489 --> 47:31.460
His phone is off.
The workers have gone home.

47:31.460 --> 47:34.060
We can't report him missing
since he's not a child.

47:34.360 --> 47:35.590
There's nothing we can do.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.599
What if something happens to him?

47:41.900 --> 47:44.400
I seriously doubt that.
He's a grown man.

47:44.699 --> 47:46.239
He may have gone to his hotel...

47:46.239 --> 47:49.440
or a restaurant
to have some food. Okay?

47:51.210 --> 47:52.779
He'll call.

47:53.079 --> 47:54.710
Didn't you say he was filthy rich?

47:57.119 --> 47:59.020
Come on.
Turn that frown upside down.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.290
He's not afraid to spend
hundreds of millions on a painting,

48:02.290 --> 48:04.590
so I'm sure he will let go
of this small mistake.

48:04.820 --> 48:06.219
If not,

48:06.690 --> 48:09.429
he's not a true lover of art.

48:11.860 --> 48:12.860
Okay?

48:14.469 --> 48:15.469
Okay?

48:42.460 --> 48:44.799
What will you do now?

49:02.780 --> 49:04.720
I'm sorry,
but do you have another card?

49:06.320 --> 49:08.150
- Please give me a second.
- Sure.

49:11.847 --> 49:13.046
Mr. Jin.

49:13.546 --> 49:15.716
This card isn't valid.

49:16.187 --> 49:17.187
What?

49:17.816 --> 49:20.216
This card isn't working.

49:20.457 --> 49:21.827
Unbelievable.

49:22.457 --> 49:25.097
Don't be ridiculous.
This is a black card.

49:25.627 --> 49:26.957
Gosh.

49:27.597 --> 49:28.597
Hey.

49:30.566 --> 49:32.796
Black card. Okay? Black.

49:33.966 --> 49:36.167
I'm sorry,
but do you have another card, sir?

49:36.167 --> 49:37.807
It's a black...

49:39.606 --> 49:41.377
Do you have another card?

49:42.307 --> 49:45.176
My gosh. Unbelievable.

49:48.946 --> 49:51.316
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

49:51.356 --> 49:53.856
That was a black card. Gosh.

50:02.566 --> 50:05.636
How could you suspend my card
when I'm on a business trip?

50:05.997 --> 50:08.566
I have no cash, and the business
team will arrive tomorrow.

50:13.606 --> 50:14.647
So...

50:15.276 --> 50:17.417
ignore the chairman's orders and fix this.

50:17.417 --> 50:18.647
If not, I'll...

50:20.886 --> 50:23.287
Mr. Kim...

50:26.057 --> 50:27.287
You scumbag.

50:30.727 --> 50:32.127
Is there a problem?

50:32.127 --> 50:33.156
What?

50:33.796 --> 50:35.227
No. Not at all.

50:35.497 --> 50:38.667
I sorted out everything.
So you can go home now.

50:39.667 --> 50:41.066
Thank you for today.

50:41.066 --> 50:42.506
Are you sure you'll be okay?

50:42.906 --> 50:46.307
Of course. You should go. Please.

50:47.446 --> 50:48.776
You should go in first.

50:51.816 --> 50:54.417
All right then. If you insist.

50:55.517 --> 50:57.086
Thanks.

51:04.656 --> 51:05.727
Go home.

51:14.267 --> 51:15.667
Thanks.

51:35.327 --> 51:36.656
You startled me.

51:46.397 --> 51:47.506
I wonder...

51:48.106 --> 51:51.676
how long it'd take if I were to walk
to the airport from here.

52:03.167 --> 52:05.737
I've been meaning
to have a meeting with Mr. Jin...

52:06.266 --> 52:08.406
to talk about the cafe.

52:08.406 --> 52:10.647
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.

52:10.746 --> 52:14.147
Forget about the cafe.
That's not the problem right now.

52:15.976 --> 52:18.917
I need you to give back
the investment money.

52:19.246 --> 52:20.317
Pardon?

52:20.317 --> 52:23.487
My father found out about the money.
He's been throwing a fit.

52:23.487 --> 52:25.527
This is a disaster.

52:26.786 --> 52:29.956
Why did you send us the chamber pot?
That was so stupid.

52:30.667 --> 52:33.766
What do you mean?

52:36.866 --> 52:38.607
Excuse me for a moment.

52:49.277 --> 52:51.487
How dare you come here?

53:15.036 --> 53:17.306
No. Please, Uncle.

53:17.906 --> 53:20.306
No. I can't bury the truth.

53:21.377 --> 53:23.246
If something is rotting,
it must be carved out.

53:23.246 --> 53:25.386
If there's been a mistake,
I must correct it.

53:47.337 --> 53:48.806
I said I was fine.

53:48.806 --> 53:51.607
I can't possibly impose on
a poor international student...

53:54.647 --> 53:55.917
No, you are not.

53:56.377 --> 53:58.047
What is this place?

53:59.647 --> 54:02.886
Ms. Prinsen is on vacation.
So the house is a mess.

54:03.717 --> 54:05.357
I see. This isn't your house.

54:05.427 --> 54:07.087
I almost thought otherwise.

54:07.226 --> 54:09.496
You can sleep on the sofa.

54:09.496 --> 54:10.797
And the bathroom is that way.

54:10.797 --> 54:13.067
We have a lot of towels,
so you can feel free to use them.

54:13.266 --> 54:15.036
Do you need anything else?

54:15.036 --> 54:16.197
I'm good.

54:16.797 --> 54:18.366
But don't bring
a stranger home next time.

54:18.366 --> 54:19.467
You know nothing about me.

54:19.467 --> 54:21.206
For all you know,
I could be dangerous.

54:21.206 --> 54:22.607
And the house owner isn't even here.

54:22.877 --> 54:25.047
Don't you know how dangerous
the world is?

54:25.476 --> 54:27.447
You can't speak English at all,
you have no money,

54:27.447 --> 54:30.177
and your credit cards are canceled.
How can I just leave you there?

54:32.317 --> 54:35.987
When someone offers you help,
a thank-you would suffice.

54:36.757 --> 54:39.556
Who would say such nonsense?
What a naive thing to say.

54:40.056 --> 54:41.427
My father.

54:42.527 --> 54:45.596
Your father is a very generous man.

54:47.226 --> 54:49.096
- Goodnight.
- Wait.

54:50.266 --> 54:52.667
Since you're helping me,
can you help me out one more time?

54:53.007 --> 54:54.237
Aren't you hungry?

54:54.636 --> 54:56.976
I had some food
at the party earlier.

54:56.976 --> 54:59.647
But you didn't eat anything
all day today.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.346
Oh, right.

55:20.596 --> 55:21.697
Gosh!

55:24.567 --> 55:28.036
What on earth? Is the house owner
a chef at a hotel?

55:29.406 --> 55:30.677
Oh, my.

55:32.076 --> 55:34.317
Do you have any food allergies?
Or any food that you don't like?

55:35.116 --> 55:36.147
No.

55:38.947 --> 55:39.947
Let me see.

55:46.757 --> 55:48.697
You won't get kicked out
for this, right?

56:05.746 --> 56:06.806
Da Li, where's the salt?

56:06.806 --> 56:09.217
You're not answering your phone,
so I'm very concerned.

56:09.447 --> 56:10.846
Please call me back
once you check this message.

56:10.846 --> 56:11.987
Thank you.

56:16.286 --> 56:19.386
Gosh. Where is it?

56:20.627 --> 56:21.897
- Da Li.
- Julian.

56:22.056 --> 56:24.467
I'm sorry to call you
so late at night.

56:24.467 --> 56:28.467
Didn't you tell me you worked
on a deal with Hitonari last year?

56:28.467 --> 56:32.007
Do you know any places
he might stay in Amsterdam?

56:40.547 --> 56:43.576
There it is. Okay.

56:56.427 --> 56:58.027
To Nakamura Sumire.

56:58.627 --> 57:00.897
This is Kim Da Li from St. Miller.

57:01.036 --> 57:02.667
I was supposed to pick up
Jin Hitonari...

57:02.667 --> 57:04.436
at the Schiphol Airport
this afternoon.

57:04.906 --> 57:06.206
But there must have been
a slight misunderstanding...

57:06.206 --> 57:07.536
as I was unable to pick him up.

57:07.536 --> 57:09.237
I cannot reach him now.

57:09.607 --> 57:12.206
And he didn't come to the hotel
he was supposed to stay.

57:12.677 --> 57:14.177
If you get a call from...

57:14.177 --> 57:15.976
You can work after we eat.

57:16.976 --> 57:20.317
We study and work,
so we can feed ourselves.

57:21.286 --> 57:22.386
I'm sorry.

57:23.717 --> 57:27.226
Whether we have money or not,
are successful or not,

57:27.226 --> 57:30.496
we all get to have three meals a day
which is the only thing that's fair.

57:30.496 --> 57:33.366
We ought to eat every single meal
as if our lives depend on it.

57:33.726 --> 57:34.766
Dig in.

57:49.417 --> 57:50.987
This is so good.

57:51.386 --> 57:52.846
How can it taste this good?

57:54.186 --> 57:55.317
Well,

57:55.956 --> 57:57.826
I was able to get merchants
in the market...

57:57.826 --> 58:00.056
to spend their emergency money
on my food at the age of 11.

58:00.056 --> 58:01.797
So this is nothing.

58:01.797 --> 58:05.067
If we were at my house,
I would've cooked up a grand meal.

58:05.127 --> 58:07.197
No. This is so grand.

58:11.507 --> 58:13.806
Are you studying
while working at the gallery?

58:15.936 --> 58:17.277
I guess you can say that.

58:18.177 --> 58:20.846
That's great. You get to look
at paintings and make money too.

58:22.147 --> 58:23.447
Do you like art?

58:25.447 --> 58:28.056
Art? Sure.

58:28.956 --> 58:30.556
Who doesn't?

58:31.186 --> 58:34.556
I have a painting in my living room too.
It's nice and big.

58:34.556 --> 58:36.897
And I admire it every day.
Morning and night.

58:37.866 --> 58:39.197
What's the painting about?

58:41.737 --> 58:43.366
(Fifty dollars)

58:43.366 --> 58:46.536
I need more than food
to go on with my life.

58:48.777 --> 58:51.877
I ought to admire money too.

58:52.677 --> 58:54.777
Gosh. Beautiful.

58:55.076 --> 58:57.917
This is art. Art is around us.

59:01.386 --> 59:04.487
My gosh. It's been hours.

59:05.027 --> 59:08.656
You're making it impossible
for me to admire my art!

59:08.956 --> 59:10.697
You're so unsophisticated.

59:12.067 --> 59:13.726
I don't think
you know this painting.

59:14.197 --> 59:15.536
It's an Asian painting.

59:16.636 --> 59:19.667
I majored in the history of Asian Art
when I was an undergraduate.

59:20.007 --> 59:21.837
If you tell me the artist...

59:21.837 --> 59:24.377
Is talking about the artist
and the price of it that important?

59:24.677 --> 59:27.007
I believe as long as the painting
satisfies the people looking at it,

59:27.476 --> 59:29.516
it's a great painting.

59:30.016 --> 59:33.346
I see. Being able to set
your own standard in art...

59:33.346 --> 59:36.587
without getting affected by trends
and the market is no easy feat.

59:37.056 --> 59:38.686
You must love that painting.

59:40.226 --> 59:41.297
Very.

59:41.726 --> 59:43.596
Then why don't you stop by
the gallery...

59:43.596 --> 59:45.467
when you have time
after your meeting?

59:45.467 --> 59:46.766
It's a small gallery.

59:46.766 --> 59:49.167
But we have numerous artworks
from artists that would entice...

59:49.167 --> 59:51.837
Korean people such as Gogh,
Seurat, Cezanne, and Gauguin.

59:53.366 --> 59:55.406
Korean people?

59:55.906 --> 59:56.906
Oh, right.

59:57.476 --> 59:59.007
Impressionist painters...

59:59.007 --> 01:00:02.076
are beloved by the world,
not just Korean people.

01:00:03.147 --> 01:00:04.217
Right.

01:00:05.346 --> 01:00:07.186
Of course,
it won't be as good as your food,

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.456
but the food in our cafeteria
is pretty good.

01:00:09.456 --> 01:00:11.886
If you have time, please stop by.
I'll show you around.

01:00:15.757 --> 01:00:17.766
A cafeteria in a gallery?

01:00:19.197 --> 01:00:20.496
That's where people go on dates.

01:00:26.507 --> 01:00:29.976
From the first time I saw you,
I always thought you were a psy...

01:00:31.746 --> 01:00:34.476
I mean, you seem like
an interesting man.

01:00:35.246 --> 01:00:36.277
I do?

01:00:36.516 --> 01:00:38.016
Your shoes,

01:00:38.016 --> 01:00:40.516
the way you count everything
by bowls of gamjatang,

01:00:40.516 --> 01:00:41.917
and back at the party too.

01:00:42.616 --> 01:00:45.527
Anyway, you're the most
interesting person I've met.

01:00:51.596 --> 01:00:52.596
Eat up.

01:01:07.047 --> 01:01:08.647
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

01:01:33.636 --> 01:01:36.507
Let's get cleaned up.

01:01:43.647 --> 01:01:47.087
That's it. What a day.

01:01:59.567 --> 01:02:00.596
What?

01:02:01.797 --> 01:02:02.797
What's going on now?

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:05.366
Come on.

01:02:10.507 --> 01:02:11.576
Da Li?

01:02:13.976 --> 01:02:16.447
Da Li, what's going on?

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:18.987
What is it? Where are you?

01:02:24.587 --> 01:02:26.087
Da Li?

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:29.297
Da Li?

01:02:33.027 --> 01:02:34.297
Da Li?

01:02:36.366 --> 01:02:37.866
Da Li?

01:02:40.107 --> 01:02:41.377
Da Li...

01:03:45.436 --> 01:03:49.206
(Dali and Cocky Prince)

01:03:49.936 --> 01:03:51.947
That watch is very important to me.

01:03:52.206 --> 01:03:54.306
I'll make sure I come,
so wait for me.

01:03:54.306 --> 01:03:56.317
You dared to betray Jin Moo Hak?

01:03:56.317 --> 01:03:57.877
You, die!

01:03:58.246 --> 01:04:01.217
I'm looking to liquidate my assets
except for the art museum.

01:04:01.217 --> 01:04:02.956
I'll make sure I find you!

01:04:04.116 --> 01:04:06.587
Are you home? Are you?

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:09.127
Are you looking for that watch...

01:04:09.127 --> 01:04:10.697
or that woman?

01:04:11.096 --> 01:04:13.496
I can't do this.
If I just sit around,

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:15.136
I'll get betrayed
over and over again.

01:04:15.136 --> 01:04:16.766
Give me my money!

01:04:16.897 --> 01:04:18.206
Mr. Jin?
