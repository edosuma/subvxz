WEBVTT

02:03.370 --> 02:04.405
Get the fuck away from me.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.287
- Get up.
- Get the fuck away from me!

02:06.370 --> 02:07.906
-Get the fuck up!
-What's your problem?

02:08.000 --> 02:08.989
- Get the...

02:09.080 --> 02:10.035
Okay, all right!

02:10.630 --> 02:11.619
Get in the truck!

02:13.340 --> 02:15.797
- Get in the fucking truck. Get--

02:33.440 --> 02:35.647
I'm not doing
the swim team this year.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.107
What? You love swim team.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.315
Not here.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.947
But you haven't even given it a try.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.657
You haven't done it here.

02:42.740 --> 02:43.866
- Mom!
- Charlotte--

02:43.950 --> 02:46.407
Mom!
Isn't that Dad's bike up there?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.086
Where is he?

02:54.630 --> 02:55.995
Just stay in the car.

02:57.380 --> 02:58.369
Stay in the car.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.340
Marty?

03:42.010 --> 03:43.329
Marty!

03:47.810 --> 03:49.960
Welcome to our home, Martin Byrde.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.356
In 1929...

04:05.030 --> 04:08.443
power company stole our land,
flooded us out.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.749
Snells fled up the mountains,
and started all over again.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.872
Trouble is, ain't much grows up here.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.373
Doesn't matter how much you turn the soil.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.916
It's the water.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.626
So the crop had to change.

04:24.720 --> 04:29.168
Do you know what'll grow almost anywhere
the sun shine, Martin?

04:31.810 --> 04:32.925
Let me tell you.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.680
Poppies.

04:37.770 --> 04:41.183
Sandy soil and drought, they don't care.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.107
But then, you came along...

04:47.200 --> 04:49.156
- I think, um-- I--
- You think?

04:49.240 --> 04:51.151
- Yeah...
- You think?

04:52.240 --> 04:56.279
You know, the problem we have here
is one of power.

04:56.370 --> 04:59.282
And you seem to think
you've got more of it than you do.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.042
Now, in these parts,
power comes from time.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.759
And our family,
we got a history older than anything.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.710
So if you think...

05:08.300 --> 05:11.258
that you can talk us out of getting
what we want

05:11.350 --> 05:13.807
with your pretty little words...

05:15.100 --> 05:18.854
then you have not yet understood
the purpose of this tour.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.018
You are a threat to my colony,
Martin Byrde.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.032
You have disturbed the ecology
of our delicate little system,

05:34.120 --> 05:37.954
interrupted the back end of our operation
when you took over the club,

05:38.040 --> 05:42.875
and now you have destroyed
our very means of distribution.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.088
-I don't see how I could've possibly--
-The church, Martin.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.500
The preacher.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.594
We need the preacher on the water.

05:54.390 --> 05:57.632
Certain members in his congregation
are in our employ.

05:57.730 --> 06:02.099
The lake is under patrol,
his service less so.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.067
Now, you pull that pigeon
out of the water...

06:07.280 --> 06:10.317
and suddenly our resellers are on land...

06:11.070 --> 06:14.233
and much more likely to be pulled over.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.531
And that will not do.

06:19.210 --> 06:23.544
Cease all construction on the church.

06:24.090 --> 06:25.409
I can do that next month.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.954
Uh...

06:27.590 --> 06:29.046
...but right now...

06:29.970 --> 06:33.292
my employer would be very upset--

06:33.390 --> 06:36.632
There's a photo on a table
in your living room,

06:36.720 --> 06:39.723
your family on a cable car
in San Francisco.

06:39.810 --> 06:42.096
Another one at Myrtle Beach.

06:43.060 --> 06:47.099
Across from the couch, there's a window
you keep open mostly at night,

06:47.190 --> 06:52.560
not 15 feet from your boy's bedroom,
up the hall on the right.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.322
And your girl's just after that.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.282
And yours, Byrde, is at the very end.

06:59.370 --> 07:01.076
Your toothbrush is blue.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.167
We know all about you, Martin.

07:06.590 --> 07:09.002
We know you work for someone dangerous...

07:10.130 --> 07:11.961
and perhaps we can't touch you...

07:13.300 --> 07:15.632
or else we risk retaliation.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.636
We also know...

07:19.520 --> 07:23.308
that you left Chicago
quicker than a heartbeat.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.816
So, personally, I'm inclined to believe

07:25.900 --> 07:28.687
that you're on the outs
with your employer...

07:29.320 --> 07:32.107
and us taking care of you
might be doing him a favor.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.737
So if this little tour hasn't
done the trick,

07:34.820 --> 07:38.233
then we will enforce our demands
In a more roundabout way,

07:38.330 --> 07:40.958
by our backup plan.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.160
Pastor Mason Young...

07:44.960 --> 07:47.497
and his lovely, pregnant wife...

07:49.210 --> 07:50.666
Gracie June.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.579
Okay.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.881
Okay.

07:58.180 --> 08:02.264
The construction will never finish.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.685
That's the game.

08:06.230 --> 08:10.735
Okay? And your pastor can stay
on the water indefinitely.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.809
Does that work?

08:14.820 --> 08:18.199
We don't want another nail.

08:18.660 --> 08:24.030
We don't want another screw
In those two acres.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.912
We see so much as a cross goin' up...

08:30.050 --> 08:33.372
and we will cut that baby out
with a paring knife.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.420
-Marty!
-Dad?

08:44.310 --> 08:45.299
Marty?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.607
Call the Blue Cat, see if he's there.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.951
Rachel hasn't seen Dad all day.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.873
Okay, kids, I need you
to go to your room right now!

09:11.300 --> 09:13.450
- I'm calling 911.
- No, no. Charlotte?

09:13.550 --> 09:17.293
Charlotte, please, honey,
just go to your room, all right?

09:25.140 --> 09:27.802
Dad. He's here.
He's here, Mom.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.102
I don't know what kind of shape
the bike's in.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.181
He just came out of nowhere
and he just kept going.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.850
He might not have realized he hit me.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.349
Hey, honey. I'm okay.

09:38.030 --> 09:40.612
I'm here now. I'm okay.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.827
Oh, my God, your leg.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.650
Yeah, it's gross, but, uh,

09:45.750 --> 09:48.628
you know, fortunately, Sue Ellen, uh,
Todd's wife, was passing by...

09:48.710 --> 09:50.450
-Yeah?
-...and she gave me a ride home.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.167
-Oh, good.
-Which was really nice of her.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.330
But we beat you.

09:55.550 --> 09:56.539
What's that?

09:56.970 --> 09:58.460
But we beat you here.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.420
You weren't there when we passed,

10:00.510 --> 10:03.001
so you must have already
been with Mrs. Becker.

10:03.510 --> 10:05.057
But we beat you here.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.648
-Um... Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.147
Uh, right. Yeah, no,
she got lost on the way here,

10:13.230 --> 10:14.561
and I wasn't paying attention.

10:14.650 --> 10:17.528
- We're just glad you're all right.
- Yeah.

10:24.660 --> 10:25.945
Lord help you...

10:27.040 --> 10:29.326
if you eat all my Pringles.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.621
What do you got, like, a date?

10:33.630 --> 10:35.757
Shut it, Wy.

10:38.130 --> 10:38.960
Hey.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.216
You look nice.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.386
Thanks.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.559
Hi, Daddy.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.281
I mean, what the fuck
kind of place is this?

11:12.370 --> 11:15.999
You know? Those people? They're gonna
cut a human out of another human?

11:16.090 --> 11:17.910
Not if we do what they want.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.659
You know, they've been in this house.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.716
-They know which windows we keep open.
-What?

11:21.800 --> 11:24.291
They know the photos that we have,
the color of my toothbrush.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.176
What the fuck are they doing
inside our house?

11:26.260 --> 11:27.420
Casing us. What do you think?

11:28.060 --> 11:31.473
The good news is that we're safe because
they're hedging that I'm untouchable,

11:31.560 --> 11:32.936
but bad news is I'm not.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.100
But they think you are?

11:34.190 --> 11:35.680
-Yeah. For now.
-Okay.

11:35.770 --> 11:38.739
I mean, Wendy, they...
they had a gun at my back.

11:38.820 --> 11:39.889
Another one on my head.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.855
Seen too many fucking guns
the last three months.

11:41.950 --> 11:43.815
-Seen too much blood--
-The kids are safe.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.821
You and I are safe.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.497
-But we have to fix this.
-I know.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.373
Every time I check the money,
there's less of it.

11:55.710 --> 11:59.043
The stacks are half
of what they were a month ago.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.296
So move on 'em.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.098
That cash isn't worth
the paper It's printed on

12:06.180 --> 12:07.807
if I don't know how to clean it.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.381
You're the smartest person
this side of the Mississippi.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.802
Anything you don't know yet,
you'll figure.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.436
-It's just, I don't... I...
-It's just what?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.317
--Just you never done it before?

12:26.870 --> 12:30.328
Huh. First times can be fun, you know.

12:30.410 --> 12:35.245
There's a... tingle that happens
right before you do it.

12:36.170 --> 12:41.870
Do you ever watch those nature shows?
The cheetahs and the gazelles and...

12:43.010 --> 12:44.830
It's natural selection, Ruth.

12:45.510 --> 12:48.638
A moron's a different species
than you and me.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.387
We got a right to take 'em out.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.459
This guy...

12:53.560 --> 12:55.221
he's a downright numbskull

12:55.310 --> 12:57.801
for leaving that shit under his bed
to begin with.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.106
You agree?

13:02.400 --> 13:05.392
-You agree?
-Yeah, I agree. I think you're right.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.117
A lot of accidents happen on the lake.

13:09.660 --> 13:11.537
Look for opportunity.

13:12.450 --> 13:15.408
Find the scenario you can control...

13:16.120 --> 13:20.033
and you do what nature intended.

13:26.130 --> 13:29.008
Hey. You'll be fine, Ruthie.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.921
You got me inside you.

13:43.730 --> 13:44.810
Check this.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.236
Holy shit.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.689
Good?

13:54.290 --> 13:56.611
You could sell this.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.416
-Serious?
-Mm-hmm!

13:58.500 --> 14:00.877
I mean, you got the eyes
in the exact right spot.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.871
You tapered the edges.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.701
Guys would spend
five or six bucks for that.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.290
Some suckers, a lot more.

14:07.380 --> 14:11.293
Well, they... they could buy
a factory fly for 30 cents,

14:11.390 --> 14:13.176
do the job just fine.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.966
--Why they buy that?

14:15.060 --> 14:19.144
Because rich people are always looking
for new ways to spend their money.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.515
-Okay.
-Hey.

14:23.860 --> 14:24.849
Listen...

14:25.610 --> 14:30.149
I've been thinking about opening a shop
down here for a while now.

14:30.240 --> 14:34.574
Bait and tackle.
Sell two-handed rods, waders...

14:34.660 --> 14:36.241
...all kinds of gear.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.571
Hand-tied flies like this.

14:39.580 --> 14:43.414
What would you say
about coming in with me on this?

14:45.250 --> 14:46.706
You and me in business?

14:47.880 --> 14:48.869
Why not?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.465
We'd be stuck.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.346
- So?

14:56.430 --> 14:59.593
No, man. I mean, we'd need...
we'd need capital.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.009
It'd cost a lot up front.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.647
No. It doesn't have to be a big place.

15:02.730 --> 15:05.437
We could operate in cash, so we don't
have to pay credit card fees.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.226
Still, all that inventory, the rent...

15:07.320 --> 15:10.642
What about that guy
your niece works with? Byrde?

15:10.740 --> 15:12.810
-Yeah, get him to invest.
-Not him.

15:12.910 --> 15:15.822
Why not? He seems to be throwing down
on a lot of places.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.610
No. I mean, he just...

15:20.580 --> 15:22.116
Actually, you know... you know what?

15:22.210 --> 15:23.074
Hmm?

15:23.880 --> 15:26.337
Real soon I might, uh,

15:26.420 --> 15:28.957
have some of my own money
to put into this thing.

15:31.470 --> 15:34.712
God, never use your own money
on a venture.

15:35.350 --> 15:38.808
Business manager,
he told me that, once, in a Starbucks.

15:39.890 --> 15:42.381
Byrde, he's better.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.688
We could make a business plan...

15:46.770 --> 15:49.318
get Ruth to make an introduction.

15:50.690 --> 15:54.319
Hmm? Come on. Come on with me.

15:54.410 --> 15:56.025
- Hmm?
- Get back. Stop it.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.441
Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Okay.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.280
--All right.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.626
All right?

16:06.630 --> 16:09.292
I mean, we can...
we can go to Splitz tomorrow.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.336
Talk to my niece.

16:14.550 --> 16:18.884
It turns out_ that the lot isn't
zoned for a religious establishment.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.096
-Mason?
-Yeah?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.808
You're gonna get your church. I promise.
We're gonna sort this out.

16:22.890 --> 16:26.769
But... until then, there just can't be
any more construction, okay?

16:26.860 --> 16:30.432
Not by you, or me, or the crew.
No one.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.858
Good news is that you can
get right back out on the water...

16:35.450 --> 16:36.656
preaching the good word.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.902
"Everything is difficult
before it is easy."

16:43.160 --> 16:45.367
- I finished it this morning.
- Right.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.280
Figured you'd want it back
in your private library.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.587
Wouldn't believe
the late fees they charge.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.546
I haven't seen you around.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.626
Yeah. You know, uh... work.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.132
-Hey, Wyatt.
-Yeah?

16:57.220 --> 17:00.132
Got some fiberglass work
on the Lucas boat.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.549
Oh, hey.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.551
-Hi.
-Yeah. Dad, just give me a second.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.800
All right.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.221
Hey, well, it was, uh...
it was really good to see you.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.435
Yeah.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.316
Oh, yeah, Charlotte.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.561
Fl' party is this weekend.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.616
-What's that?
-Fuck the Tourists.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.533
It's a big locals' thing.
Celebrates the end of summer.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.189
Oh. Uh...

17:24.080 --> 17:26.537
Sounds cool, I guess. You know, I...

17:26.620 --> 17:27.860
Not your scene.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.700
Sorry. Just...

17:31.000 --> 17:32.046
Sorry.

17:39.010 --> 17:41.137
All right, hand me that patch kit.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.845
It's not you, you know.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.181
-What?
-That girl...

17:50.400 --> 17:51.810
She just doesn't know who she is yet.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.061
I mean, without the church,

17:56.150 --> 17:58.311
we're back to the Blue Cat and the club,
and I just...

17:58.410 --> 18:01.277
I don't know if those two can handle
the rest of it, you know?

18:01.700 --> 18:04.999
- You'll make it work.
- Yeah, what if I can't? What then?

18:05.950 --> 18:07.110
We run.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.701
We put the kids in the car, and we run.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.337
You know, we do need money. We do.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.548
We need money.
We need clean money in our name.

18:14.630 --> 18:18.259
All of our personal assets are wrapped up
in that goddamn bulldozed house

18:18.340 --> 18:19.671
and the church lot.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.216
-We're fucked.
-Okay.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.461
-Look, you just focus on Del's money...
-Yeah.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.097
-...and I'll worry about ours. Okay?
-Yeah.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.556
Good luck.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.948
This has been the best quarter
you've had in seven years, Sam.

18:38.030 --> 18:39.315
- Yeah.
- Your sales,

18:39.410 --> 18:41.310
they're up 43% from last August.

18:41.410 --> 18:44.573
I mean, while the regional comps,
they're down 6%.

18:44.660 --> 18:47.868
I mean, and the only real difference
you've made in your...

18:47.950 --> 18:51.204
in your business model,
over the last year, is me.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.451
Well, my mom puts in
the extra time, too, though.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.160
Sam, I have to redo everything she does.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.251
I know, but she still puts in the time.

19:00.630 --> 19:02.040
I deserve a bonus.

19:02.550 --> 19:05.212
The_se cookies are awful.
DId you bake these?

19:05.310 --> 19:08.017
Eugenia, would you mind terribly if...
if we just finished up here?

19:08.100 --> 19:10.091
Yes, I would. We're about to open.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.392
Okay. Wendy, go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.639
Since I've been working with you,

19:17.730 --> 19:21.109
you've been able to increase
your commission from 5 to 7%.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.940
Now, I did some math.

19:23.030 --> 19:28.445
And you've been able to have
an additional earnings of $192,000.

19:28.540 --> 19:29.905
I think it's only fair

19:30.000 --> 19:33.288
that I should request a bonus
beyond my hourly,

19:33.380 --> 19:36.588
that will align my total compensation
with my value.

19:36.670 --> 19:37.955
--Okay.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.796
What are we talking?

19:42.760 --> 19:44.466
Half your increase in income.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.176
Half?

19:48.310 --> 19:49.174
Oh.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.307
And, you know, if you don't agree,

19:51.390 --> 19:54.359
I thank you for everything,
and you know, I'll just go...

19:54.440 --> 19:56.897
I'll go right on over to, uh,
to Lakeview Realty.

19:56.980 --> 19:58.527
-I'll see what they can offer me.
-No.

19:58.610 --> 19:59.599
Mom, just...

19:59.690 --> 20:02.318
Okay. Okay. I'll give you 10,000.

20:02.740 --> 20:03.855
Forty.

20:03.950 --> 20:06.908
That coupled with my salary
will be a little less than a third

20:06.990 --> 20:09.493
of your additional profits, give or take.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.655
-Take. With you.
-Okay. Mom.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.787
This hussy comes in here,
bats her eyes

20:14.880 --> 20:18.088
and gets your money gone faster
than a toupee in a hurricane.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.877
You know, I think I'll just go on
and do it, ﬁnally.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.509
Change my will.
Give my money to the ASPCA.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.172
Save a stray cat,
since that's what you're doing.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.960
Mom...

20:29.390 --> 20:31.597
Goddamn it.

20:34.810 --> 20:37.859
25,000.
And you take care of the open house today.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.929
Mom...?

21:08.050 --> 21:09.130
Yeah, listen, Ruth,

21:09.220 --> 21:11.552
I'm gonna be coming by tomorrow afternoon
with my contractor.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.959
We're gonna reroof the club

21:13.060 --> 21:15.346
and we're gonna do a little work
in the employees' lounge.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.761
No. We just redid the employee lounge.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.647
I'm gonna need a ride afterwards.
They need...

21:19.730 --> 21:22.062
They need another van
to help expedite the work,

21:22.150 --> 21:23.435
so I'm just gonna leave them mine.

21:24.490 --> 21:25.559
A ride?

21:26.070 --> 21:28.527
Yeah. Sometime in the afternoon.
I'm not sure when.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.281
Uh, yeah, I... I can give you a ride.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.650
Okay. Thank you.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.330
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:47.430 --> 21:48.328
How you doing?

21:48.430 --> 21:50.887
There are, like,
a dozen staff members outside,

21:50.970 --> 21:54.303
all dying to buy you a beer,
and you're stuck in your cave

21:54.390 --> 21:56.517
-with your worried face.
-Yeah.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.012
Goodness.
You are the worst at celebrating.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.649
Uh, well, listen,
we gotta recarpet the rooms,

22:02.730 --> 22:03.936
and I've already placed the order,

22:04.030 --> 22:07.488
so I'm just waiting to hear if we can, uh,
take delivery next week.

22:08.950 --> 22:10.440
We're fully booked next week.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.486
We've got three open suites,

22:12.580 --> 22:14.946
so I was just gonna rotate guests
as they come,

22:15.040 --> 22:18.203
and we'll do the regular rooms first,
then we'll do the cabins aftenNards.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.877
Why don't we just wait
till the off-season?

22:21.960 --> 22:24.542
Better to do_it now.
'Cause they upcharge In the off-season.

22:24.630 --> 22:27.667
Everybody does their renovations then.
Sound good?

22:56.240 --> 22:57.070
Good.

22:57.450 --> 23:02.205
And I mean for, like...
the first time since my grandma died.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.708
You know how I...
I told you not to get my hopes up?

23:09.470 --> 23:11.927
Well, they're up.

23:15.850 --> 23:17.761
- Yeah?
- They're up.

23:19.100 --> 23:19.930
Good.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.390
Okay, well...

23:24.770 --> 23:26.681
there's a drink with your name on it.

23:27.610 --> 23:30.647
-Thank you. I'll be up there in a bit.
-Okay.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.286
Byrde swooping in.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.968
Your kids are in there
killing towel heads to heavy metal.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.460
I couldn't hear myself fart.

23:54.550 --> 23:58.509
Okay. You know what, Buddy?
If it isn't too inconvenient...

23:59.890 --> 24:01.221
would you shut up?

24:02.690 --> 24:05.056
So I can drown my stress in quiet.

24:07.770 --> 24:10.273
-What's itching your crotch?
-Shh, shh, shh.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.351
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.586
Why'd you move here?

24:41.060 --> 24:44.268
I dealt with unions back in Detroit.

24:48.190 --> 24:49.726
And politicians.

24:55.910 --> 24:57.980
There was a bit of trouble.

25:00.910 --> 25:02.036
Came here.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.701
For the Magic Dragon.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.910
What kind of trouble?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.771
I killed Jimmy Hoffa.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.990
Ah, fuck!

26:00.430 --> 26:02.341
Oh, fuckin' thing...

26:17.860 --> 26:19.942
Gonna tell me why you came here?

26:21.620 --> 26:22.735
Nope.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.746
--I was in politics once.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.126
In Chicago.

26:36.670 --> 26:39.719
Obama's second state legislature campaign.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.017
I was good at it.

26:47.310 --> 26:50.438
Goddamn it. I was really...
I was really good at it.

26:52.690 --> 26:55.067
I just loved everything he stood for.

26:56.070 --> 26:58.391
What we were all trying to do together.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.362
Childcare was more than my paycheck, so...

27:09.250 --> 27:11.366
And now, here I am.

27:13.420 --> 27:16.207
In Nowhere, Missouri.

27:19.050 --> 27:20.620
And Obama's...

27:21.930 --> 27:23.170
Obama.

27:27.850 --> 27:30.512
Well, he seems like a smart enough guy.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.391
Not that I'd ever vote for a Muslim.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.892
Jesus Christ.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.656
Hey, how's that heart?

27:42.740 --> 27:45.152
Oh, it's fucking great.

27:47.410 --> 27:49.071
There's a package for you.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.788
Left it on the counter.
It came this afternoon.

27:51.870 --> 27:52.825
Thanks.

28:12.850 --> 28:13.680
Hi.

28:14.310 --> 28:16.301
What are you doing sitting alone
in the dark?

28:20.860 --> 28:21.770
Wendy?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.867
Del sent us something.

30:36.410 --> 30:38.241
We got a business plan
and everything.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.582
We got other shit in motion, moron.

30:42.670 --> 30:45.047
Or did your thick head just forget?

30:45.130 --> 30:46.791
I ain't the one who forgot!

30:46.880 --> 30:48.871
Way you been sitting on shit,

30:48.970 --> 30:51.040
looks like you're the one
who lost sight of the goal.

30:51.140 --> 30:54.257
Can you give us just one sec?

30:56.350 --> 30:57.886
-No problem.
-Thank you.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.146
It's about opportunity.

31:06.230 --> 31:09.028
And without opportunity, you get caught.

31:09.110 --> 31:10.190
And guess what?

31:10.280 --> 31:14.614
I got my hands on some good goddamn
opportunity this afternoon.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.530
So fuck off.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.441
Bullshit, you do. What?

31:18.540 --> 31:20.576
No way.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.206
'Cause you don't got a plan!

31:24.540 --> 31:27.008
His dock. Okay?

31:27.090 --> 31:29.467
I'm rigging it to light him up.

31:29.550 --> 31:33.293
I'm gonna give him a ride home,
and watch him burn.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.005
Perfect accident.

31:35.100 --> 31:37.637
And if you wanna take that chunk
for your payday,

31:37.720 --> 31:39.267
and open a bait shop...

31:39.350 --> 31:41.477
-And tackle.
-...then you go right on.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.766
In the meantime,

31:42.850 --> 31:46.149
shut your fucknugget mouth
and get the hell out.

31:57.580 --> 32:00.242
Hey. What the hell was that about?

32:00.330 --> 32:01.740
Fucking bitch, that's what.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.570
Come on. Hey.

32:03.670 --> 32:06.127
She's an entitled piece of shit is all.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.079
Fuck!

32:16.720 --> 32:19.848
Russ,
what was she talking about in there?

32:19.930 --> 32:21.477
What is in motion?

32:24.650 --> 32:28.268
Let's just say Marty Byrde
isn't gonna be investing in much anymore.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.850
And what does that mean?

32:32.530 --> 32:34.407
If you and Ruth are planning
on doing something,

32:34.490 --> 32:35.525
I wanna know about it.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.692
Especially if it has to do with--
Hey, would you look at me? Hey!

32:41.370 --> 32:44.362
Don't go doing something
that's gonna get your ass thrown in jail.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.666
I just fucking found you.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.085
Hey, Anna.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.582
Uh, have you had the chance
to look over the handbook?

32:55.680 --> 32:57.136
You have any questions?

32:57.220 --> 32:59.211
Uh, you know, no, I haven't opened it yet.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.460
Wow. Busy few days, huh?

33:01.560 --> 33:02.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.648
Well, listen, my friends and I are getting
some fries on the deck

33:05.730 --> 33:07.470
if you want to join us later, maybe.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.766
Oh. Um...

33:09.570 --> 33:10.776
Naperthrill!

33:13.490 --> 33:16.562
Um, I have a thing to do tonight,
so I can't.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.901
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, next time.

33:18.990 --> 33:20.116
Yeah. Definitely.

33:20.700 --> 33:21.826
Bye.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.199
So, Zach...

33:33.090 --> 33:34.626
that invite to Party Cove still good?

33:36.800 --> 33:37.676
We're going now.

33:41.510 --> 33:44.138
-Give me five minutes.
-Okay.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.931
Thought we were beautiful for a second

33:52.030 --> 33:54.567
Gave you all control
I regret it

33:55.240 --> 33:58.983
'Cause on and on and on
You let me fall

34:00.700 --> 34:02.986
Told you I'd give it all in a minute

34:03.080 --> 34:05.708
Found it unusual when you didn't

34:06.290 --> 34:09.373
So I'll just wait right here
Until you do

34:10.420 --> 34:12.581
And I'll just be waiting for you

34:21.260 --> 34:24.388
- And I'll just be waiting for you
-

34:46.120 --> 34:47.781
- Whoo!

34:48.460 --> 34:50.496
Uh, I'll just pick you up
with the boat, okay?

34:50.580 --> 34:51.911
No, I'll just call Wendy.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.128
I'm sure she can get rid of Sam early
and come get me.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.666
It's not a big deal. I'm on my way.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.330
Meet me at the strip dock.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.756
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.499
Okay.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.419
Bye.

35:18.490 --> 35:21.778
-- Smoke in the air, binge drinking

35:22.700 --> 35:25.533
They lose it when
The DJ drops the needle

35:26.330 --> 35:28.946
Getting so cold I'm not blinkin'

35:29.660 --> 35:32.413
What in the world was I thinkin'?

35:32.500 --> 35:35.378
New day, new money to be made

35:36.090 --> 35:38.752
There is nothin' to explain

35:40.760 --> 35:42.830
-It's right there on the left.
-Thanks.

36:12.580 --> 36:13.569
Okay.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.456
Beer?

36:17.210 --> 36:18.245
I'll take yours.

36:23.470 --> 36:26.598
-You are...
-What?

36:29.810 --> 36:30.879
How old are you?

36:35.810 --> 36:37.721
Old enough to drink that beer?

36:39.650 --> 36:40.685
Nope.

37:06.970 --> 37:08.426
You sure this is okay?

37:11.220 --> 37:14.053
That girl is a real crowd-pleaser

37:14.140 --> 37:17.268
Small world
All her friends know me

37:17.360 --> 37:20.067
Young bull livin' like an old geezer

37:20.650 --> 37:23.437
Quick release the cash
Watch it fall slowly

37:24.450 --> 37:27.317
Frat girls still tryin' to get even

37:27.410 --> 37:30.197
Haters mad for whatever reason

38:24.710 --> 38:27.167
You know, I'm not...
I'm not sure what her...

38:27.260 --> 38:28.875
what her schedule is, you know?

38:28.970 --> 38:32.758
She'll probably be, um,
out and about doing something.

38:32.850 --> 38:36.308
Um... but somebody should be here
around 4:00.

38:36.390 --> 38:40.303
Um, and if not,
maybe just put the keys on the...

38:40.400 --> 38:43.062
you know, on the tire
or something like that.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.687
Just on the top of the, um...
wheel well.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.098
That'd be great.

38:51.910 --> 38:55.073
So, that... that works, right? Ruth?

38:56.160 --> 38:57.491
-Hello?
-Hmm?

38:58.830 --> 39:00.491
Can you drop off the van tomorrow?

39:01.670 --> 39:03.376
Yeah. Yeah.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.166
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.217
Oh, and, you know,
you've been great at the club.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.585
Really. Thank you.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.341
-Thanks.
-G'night.

39:21.350 --> 39:22.351
Hello.

39:23.770 --> 39:26.227
Yeah, the files are all delivered. Uh...

39:26.320 --> 39:28.891
You should be ready to start tomorrow...

39:38.330 --> 39:39.399
Hey.

39:42.670 --> 39:44.319
You on a rabbit hunt?

39:44.420 --> 39:46.627
--Whoa, whoa.

39:47.630 --> 39:48.949
Didn't mean to bother.

39:59.810 --> 40:01.971
No, I understand. I get it.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.391
Yeah, it's, uh...

40:03.480 --> 40:05.721
I really, really, really appreciate it.

40:05.820 --> 40:06.684
Okay?

40:07.480 --> 40:10.449
Uh, let's...
I guess we'll talk in a day or two?

40:11.320 --> 40:13.402
Okay. Thank you so much.

40:15.990 --> 40:17.787
We're getting the carpet by Tuesday.

40:17.870 --> 40:19.906
So...
Where does that leave us?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.991
Close. Very, very close.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.449
That's 16,000 square feet
at 69 cents a foot,

40:26.540 --> 40:30.169
billed as 32,000 square feet
at $8.75 a foot.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.421
That's $270,000 clean.

40:32.510 --> 40:35.889
The employee locker rooms
and the office renovation,

40:35.970 --> 40:37.551
that's another $150,000.

40:37.640 --> 40:42.009
And the cabin kitchenettes is at least
another $75,000, maybe 80.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.055
All of that is...

40:43.600 --> 40:45.181
Yeah, it's more than close.

40:45.270 --> 40:48.182
That's... We're gonna make it.
We're making it.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.219
We're gonna make it.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.231
We're gonna make it.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.355
We're gonna make it.

40:56.490 --> 40:57.980
We're gonna make it.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.375
We're okay.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.587
All right? We're gonna make it.

43:52.670 --> 43:53.739
What the fuck?

43:54.880 --> 43:57.792
- Whoa. Incoming.
- Did you fuck with my shit?

43:57.880 --> 43:59.711
- The hell you talking about?
- The dock.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.586
What dock?

44:02.590 --> 44:04.171
I rigged it this afternoon.

44:04.260 --> 44:06.888
Thirty fucking minutes later, unrigged.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.801
You wanna tell me what the fuck happened?

44:13.900 --> 44:16.266
Oh, shit,
you were gonna do it today?

44:16.360 --> 44:18.180
- Shut up, Boyd.

44:19.150 --> 44:22.779
Russ, you're the only other person
on this fucking planet

44:22.860 --> 44:24.020
who knew what I intended.

44:24.110 --> 44:26.158
The fuck are you accusing me of?

44:26.240 --> 44:29.789
Hey, maybe you
just didn't rig it right, Ruth.

44:30.120 --> 44:34.159
Yeah? Why don't I rig our dock right now
and throw you in?

44:34.250 --> 44:37.287
Hmm? Then you can tell me
if I rigged it right, fuck!

44:37.380 --> 44:38.415
Cunt!

44:38.500 --> 44:40.877
-Stand back, little girl.
-Fuck off!

44:41.420 --> 44:43.832
You unrigged that dock, Russ, huh?

44:45.090 --> 44:46.671
Huh? You do it?

44:47.510 --> 44:50.422
'Cause someone fucking fixed that thing.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.306
And I'm sure as shit it wasn't a chipmunk!

44:52.390 --> 44:54.722
Why don't you take your tampon
outta your ear

44:54.810 --> 44:58.314
and listen to Boyd when he says
you must have fucked it up?

44:58.400 --> 44:59.685
-Russ--
-Huh? No.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.949
You pussed out, latchkey!
You pussed out!

45:04.910 --> 45:06.480
The fact is,

45:06.570 --> 45:08.947
you ain't nothing
but a Jheri-curled nancy

45:09.030 --> 45:12.488
just using mind games
to fucking buy more time.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.365
Fact is...

45:17.130 --> 45:21.248
we should have never let a little bitch
do a man's job.

45:42.610 --> 45:45.101
Ruth's gonna return the van
this afternoon,

45:45.200 --> 45:48.613
so I'm gonna take Buddy's car to work.

45:48.700 --> 45:49.576
Okay.

45:52.910 --> 45:54.366
Last night, um...

45:54.870 --> 45:55.746
Yeah?

45:57.920 --> 45:59.035
When you...

46:04.920 --> 46:06.296
You've never done that before.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.290
I thought you'd like it.

46:09.550 --> 46:10.926
What's that supposed to mean?

46:13.180 --> 46:15.637
-What does it mean?
-Why would you think I would like that?

46:16.140 --> 46:17.630
After all these years, you...

46:19.730 --> 46:21.516
Uh... I thought you did.

48:08.630 --> 48:11.542
Charlie, cop a squat. Fries?

48:11.630 --> 48:13.586
No, thanks. Have you seen Zach?

48:14.180 --> 48:15.920
He's pulling his boat out today.

48:17.510 --> 48:20.263
-Pulling it out?
-Yep. Done for the season.

48:20.350 --> 48:23.399
He has, like, some work thing
over Labor Day, so...

48:41.790 --> 48:44.532
Pulled her out
before he left for Chicago this morning.

48:48.000 --> 48:48.989
He didn't tell you?

48:52.550 --> 48:54.791
Heard you two were at Party Cove
the other night.

48:57.760 --> 49:01.059
You know,
they always leave, Charlotte.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.227
That's the difference between us and them.

49:07.610 --> 49:08.816
And you...

49:09.520 --> 49:10.851
guess you're one of us now.

49:24.210 --> 49:26.496
Oh. Hey. Thank you for returning her.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.662
- No problem.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Ruth.

49:28.750 --> 49:29.785
No, I'm fine.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.666
-Come in here.
-I gotta get back to the club.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.625
It'll... just take a minute. Come on.

49:37.300 --> 49:39.882
Yeah, just... just wait right here.
I'll be right back.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.226
Sit.

49:54.650 --> 49:56.060
Is this a boy?

50:00.740 --> 50:02.037
Is it someone at home?

50:03.540 --> 50:04.575
It's gonna sting.

50:06.620 --> 50:08.451
- Okay.

50:09.790 --> 50:10.836
--Okay.

50:11.380 --> 50:13.336
Ah.

50:15.050 --> 50:17.678
- One more.
- Ow, ow.

50:22.260 --> 50:23.261
I tripped.

50:26.350 --> 50:27.339
Hmm.

50:28.650 --> 50:29.639
I tripped once.

50:31.860 --> 50:33.350
Very long time ago.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.391
And then I tripped again.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.310
And then, the third time...

50:41.410 --> 50:44.197
I told myself
I would never go down that trail again.

50:45.750 --> 50:47.399
Too many obstacles.

50:51.670 --> 50:54.878
Charlotte? I thought you were
going to brunch.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.587
- Canceled.
- I gotta get.

50:56.670 --> 50:59.082
Okay. Just wait.
Wait, one second.

51:03.970 --> 51:05.130
Okay, now...

51:07.890 --> 51:09.096
call me if you need anything.

51:12.650 --> 51:13.639
Anything.

51:21.660 --> 51:23.230
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.025
Uh... Okay, bye.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.081
Whatever happened
to my toy chest?

51:40.260 --> 51:42.637
- They lost it.
- How?

51:46.520 --> 51:49.921
Sometimes, things just... get lost.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.101
I hate it here.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.816
--I know.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.297
Hi. What's going on?

52:25.050 --> 52:26.756
Oh, well, I was worried about you.

52:26.850 --> 52:30.092
You know, you were so stressed.
Wanted to know what was going on.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.841
-Rachel--
-What did you know that I didn't?

52:31.940 --> 52:33.931
And I, uh...
And I open up the books here...

52:34.850 --> 52:37.899
And, um, well, they are pristine.

52:37.980 --> 52:40.858
I mean, really, they're beautiful.

52:40.940 --> 52:43.238
-Rachel--
-They're also bullshit.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.198
I mean, there is a charge here
for June 12th.

52:46.280 --> 52:49.329
June 12th,
where you ordered 25 air conditioners.

52:49.410 --> 52:52.493
Now, the thing is,
we only installed four, Marty.

52:52.580 --> 52:54.457
And I thought,
"Well, that must be a mistake.

52:54.540 --> 52:55.746
Right? That's gotta be a mistake."

52:55.830 --> 52:59.743
Which is strange for Pleats, but fine.
Okay. That happens.

52:59.840 --> 53:03.298
And then I saw
the burger patty order,

53:03.380 --> 53:05.007
and the snack bar invoice.

53:05.090 --> 53:07.797
I mean, there's an estimate here
for the swim dock

53:07.890 --> 53:10.768
that is ten times higher
than any sane human would pay

53:10.850 --> 53:12.977
unless sane human was...
was makIng the SWlm dock

53:13.060 --> 53:14.596
out of Carrara fucking marble.

53:14.690 --> 53:17.261
-Rachel--
-There is enough carpeting here for the...

53:17.360 --> 53:19.316
for the goddamn Mall of America.

53:19.400 --> 53:20.890
I mean, the wiring...

53:20.980 --> 53:22.982
-There's wiring we've never done.
-I know what's on the papers.

53:23.070 --> 53:24.776
-The liquor invoice. I--
-I know what's there.

53:24.860 --> 53:27.738
I don't know what the fuck it is
that you are doing here,

53:27.820 --> 53:29.447
but it sure as hell ain't legal.

53:30.370 --> 53:32.577
Let me explain it. It's very simple.

53:33.290 --> 53:34.325
You lied to me.

53:34.410 --> 53:36.071
I know I did. For a good reason.

53:36.170 --> 53:39.037
This whole summer,
it's all been camera angles

53:39.130 --> 53:40.916
like the photo with the fucking fish.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.252
-Look... Rachel.
-None of this is real.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.336
Everything is working just fine.

53:48.550 --> 53:51.178
-This can all be explained.
-I need you to leave my property.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.510
I can't leave. I'm not leaving.

53:52.600 --> 53:53.919
I have a target I need to hit.

53:54.020 --> 53:55.135
I need you to go now. Please.

53:55.230 --> 53:56.686
Listen. I have a target I need to hit.

53:56.770 --> 53:58.510
I need some more time.
I need until the fall.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.352
Hey. Listen. Hey. Rachel.
Listen to me.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.931
I work for somebody...
Stop fucking around with the paper.

54:04.030 --> 54:06.100
-Marty, I need you to go now.
-I know. I heard you.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.691
I work for somebody,
and ifI don't hit my target,

54:08.780 --> 54:10.577
there's gonna be men
that are gonna come here,

54:10.660 --> 54:11.820
that are gonna kill me.

54:11.910 --> 54:14.117
They're gonna kill my wife
and kill my kids.

54:14.200 --> 54:15.747
Well, I can't help you with that.

54:15.830 --> 54:17.491
-You better help me with that.
-No, I cannot.

54:17.580 --> 54:19.241
I'm talking about my life,
my family's life.

54:19.330 --> 54:20.831
-I need you to go now!
-Listen to me.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.831
Let me explain to you the situation.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.751
-I'll tell you everything.
-I'm gonna call the police.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.467
Trust me, you're not gonna call shit.

54:26.550 --> 54:27.539
You're not gonna tell--

54:27.630 --> 54:30.087
-Marty, go, now!
-Put the fucking phone down!

54:30.180 --> 54:31.386
Put the phone down,

54:31.470 --> 54:34.462
and let me finish telling you
what all of this is about.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.266
I'm talk--
Put the fucking phone down!

55:30.280 --> 55:31.235
Call Wendy.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.527
I'm sorry, Martin,
I do not understand.

55:33.620 --> 55:36.692
- Fucking piece of shit.
- Call... Wendy.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.610
Calling Wendy Byrde.

55:55.850 --> 55:58.136
Hi, this is Wendy.
Leave me a message.

55:59.140 --> 56:00.767
They put up a cross.

56:02.900 --> 56:05.391
Jesus fuck! They put up a cross.
