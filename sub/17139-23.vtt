WEBVTT

00:02.120 --> 00:04.771
Did you know people tell stories about us?

00:04.920 --> 00:07.241
Yeah. Apparently,
we're a little bit legendary.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.603
- Let's begin.
- DEAN: Mom?

00:29.320 --> 00:32.448
MARY: <i>I have sort of been working with
the British Men of Letters.</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:33.965
DEAN: <i>I know how much you hate them.</i>

00:34.120 --> 00:36.441
<i>No, we hate them. Us. Together.</i>

00:37.880 --> 00:38.961
Lucifer is back.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.482
DR. HESS: <i>Crowley's dead.
And the Devil is out looking for his son.</i>

00:49.640 --> 00:50.801
CASTIEL: <i>A Nephilim has come into being.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:53.281
KELLY: <i>I can feel it. I'm its mother.</i>

00:57.440 --> 00:58.805
KELLY: <i>My baby's not evil.</i>

01:00.480 --> 01:01.970
CASTIEL: <i>He showed me the future.</i>

01:03.600 --> 01:05.250
- CASTIEL: <i>I have faith.</i>
- Don't.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.481
CASTIEL: <i>This child.</i>

01:12.920 --> 01:14.206
MR. KETCH: <i>She will shoot you.</i>

01:19.440 --> 01:20.441
Mary!

01:47.200 --> 01:49.009
God, please.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.405
I need help.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.891
OPERATOR:
<i>I'm trying to help you, ma 'am.</i>

01:55.080 --> 01:57.526
Are you, Sven?

01:57.720 --> 02:00.371
Because if you ask me if I have
the quarter inch Allen wrench

02:00.520 --> 02:01.760
one more time,

02:01.920 --> 02:03.684
I am going to come down there

02:03.840 --> 02:07.003
and burn your giant, Viking, junkyard
of a store to the ground.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.604
Do you understand?

02:09.560 --> 02:11.722
OPERATOR: <i>Are you sure
it wasn't in the box?</i>

02:11.880 --> 02:14.167
God!

02:15.040 --> 02:16.246
Kelly.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.930
I told you I'd put this together.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.969
I'm very good at following instructions.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.400
And you need to rest.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.289
- No, I don't.
- Kelly.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.249
No, Cass, I don't.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.525
I can't.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.571
I don't know how long until...

02:37.040 --> 02:39.122
I don't know how long I have left,

02:39.840 --> 02:41.171
and I...

02:41.320 --> 02:43.846
I'm never gonna be able to teach him
how to ride a bike,

02:44.000 --> 02:45.809
or watch him get married,

02:47.120 --> 02:48.281
or even look him in the eyes.

02:50.960 --> 02:55.170
But I can build him a stupid Swedish crib.
I can do that.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.289
Kelly, I know how hard this is.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.287
That's a lie.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.884
I have no idea how hard this is for you.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.450
But I promise you,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.604
I will do everything.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.169
I will give my life for your son.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.964
And I will raise him.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.122
And I will make him
someone you will be proud of.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.846
I know.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.331
Okay, let me just get this straight.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.211
So, we beat the Brits,

03:48.360 --> 03:50.931
we kick their psycho, tea-swilling asses,

03:51.520 --> 03:53.841
and instead of popping champagne
and hitting Vegas,

03:54.040 --> 03:55.041
we get Lucifer.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.010
- And you're sure it's him?
- Yeah. That's his old vessel, too.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.162
- How is that possible?
- Crowley, I guess.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.522
- And now he's dead'?
- DEAN: <i>Well, that's what Hess said,</i>

04:03.720 --> 04:05.006
but Crowley's a frigging cockroach.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.330
<i>I'll believe he's gone
when I see the body.</i>

04:07.480 --> 04:08.481
<i>And burn it.</i>

04:10.040 --> 04:11.041
This is gonna hurt.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.086
SAM: <i>We don't need Crowley.</i>

04:54.240 --> 04:55.446
We need Rowena.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.046
I mean, she's the one who can slam
Lucifer back into the Cage.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.569
Great. So, where is she?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.120
Oh, hey, Sammy.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.601
What?

05:35.320 --> 05:39.086
LUCIFER: <i>Oh, if you're looking for Rowena,
she is presently indisposed.</i>

05:40.480 --> 05:41.686
<i>Which is a delicate way of saying</i>

05:41.840 --> 05:44.889
I stomped on her face
till the white meat showed,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.804
and then set her on fire, just in case.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.770
<i>Ah. Gingers.</i>

05:51.920 --> 05:57.165
It was messy and scream-y,
but it had to be done, Sam.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.610
I'm about to be a dad.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.326
Can't raise the little nipper
from a jail cell now, can I?

06:05.360 --> 06:09.445
Speaking of, you know where
your little pal Castiel is?

06:10.720 --> 06:11.721
Go to Hell.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.804
Ooh, good one.
Witty, I'll use that in the future.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.810
<i>All right, well,
I'd love to chat with you,</i>

06:19.680 --> 06:21.603
but, uh, why waste my time, right?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.321
<i>It's not like you matter.</i>

06:24.480 --> 06:26.847
I don't need to put on
the old Sam suit anymore, do I?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.570
You know, if you think
we're just gonna let you walk...

06:28.720 --> 06:29.846
Oh, hey, Dean!

06:31.320 --> 06:33.482
No, you fellas are gonna try,
you know, whatever...

06:33.640 --> 06:34.846
Whatever you're gonna try.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.610
<i>But you can't kill me.</i>

06:36.760 --> 06:37.886
<i>You've never been able to kill me.</i>

06:38.080 --> 06:41.289
And with witch bitch gone,
you can't put me back in the Cage,

06:41.440 --> 06:45.331
so like I said, you don't matter.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.801
<i>Okay.</i>

06:47.520 --> 06:49.648
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.406
Bye, dear.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.042
I'm just saying, the checkout guy
looked at us like we were super weird.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.009
Oh, you get used to it.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.051
Okay, but, Cass,
I mean, you went a little overboard.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.247
I disagree.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.970
I have read 74 books on child-rearing,

07:42.120 --> 07:44.521
and there is one thing
that they all agree on.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.409
Everybody poops.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.211
Well, you're not wrong.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.561
I'm fine.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.490
I'm fine.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.764
You know, Lucifer's right.
We can't kill him.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.491
And we can't slam his ass
back in the Cage.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.245
Yeah, okay. So maybe we play for time.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.684
Find Cass and Kelly, and keep 'em moving.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.888
If Lucifer can't find them,
he can't hurt them.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.769
You think Castiel is gonna go along
with that?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.760
Think we'll give him a choice?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.121
MARY: <i>And the baby?</i>

08:47.960 --> 08:49.371
SAM: <i>Hopefully, we can still
siphon off its grace.</i>

08:49.520 --> 08:52.490
If not, uh,
we'll figure something else out.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.800
Yeah, we better.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.090
All right then.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.642
Kind of always wanted
to punch the Devil in the face.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.042
<i>So, how do we find them?</i>

09:07.480 --> 09:09.801
SAM: <i>All right, look,
we know Kelly's gonna have that kid soon.</i>

09:09.960 --> 09:11.325
<i>Like, really soon.</i>

09:11.480 --> 09:12.481
<i>And according to the lore,</i>

09:12.640 --> 09:14.688
<i>whenever a Nephilim is born,
there are signs,</i>

09:14.840 --> 09:16.729
storms, outbreaks of disease,

09:16.880 --> 09:17.961
a plague of locusts...

09:18.160 --> 09:19.685
- Things get biblical.
- SAM: <i>Exactly.</i>

09:19.840 --> 09:21.330
That much power into the world,

09:21.480 --> 09:25.007
whenever and wherever it happens,
things get weird.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.647
So we're looking for something weird.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.851
Yeah. Story of our lives.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.521
Where?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.006
How?

10:46.280 --> 10:47.361
You?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.002
<i>Hi, Jack. It's, uh...</i>

11:07.920 --> 11:09.604
I'm your mom.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.364
I know you're gonna be okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.083
You are gonna be amazing.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.446
You have an angel watching over you.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.123
<i>God, I love you, Jack.</i>

11:32.600 --> 11:35.968
I love you so much.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.806
Sorry.

11:41.880 --> 11:42.927
I love you.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.806
Hey, listen to this.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.446
"Two-headed calf was born
in Lava Hot Springs, ldaho."

12:13.600 --> 12:14.761
That's weird.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.007
That is weird.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.686
Yeah, but not our kind of weird.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.726
Look, wherever this thing is gonna be,
it's gonna be big and bad.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.166
You rang?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.770
Hello, boys.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.046
Did you do it? Did you let Lucifer out?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.850
- I didn't let...
- DEAN: Don't!

12:36.840 --> 12:38.569
Moose? A little help here?

12:38.720 --> 12:39.846
Dean, wait.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.126
- Seriously?
- MARY: Seriously?

12:41.320 --> 12:42.685
Just don't kill him.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.606
He worked the Cage spell with Rowena.
Maybe he can help us.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.691
- And what if he can't?
- Well, then we kill him.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.011
Cage spell?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.201
Thought you had Mother for that.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.601
Rowena's dead.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.409
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.481
<i>Lucifer.</i>

13:10.960 --> 13:12.041
Funny.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.609
I always thought
I'd be the one to kill her.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.410
Crowley, why did you do it, save Lucifer?
What did you want?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.485
I wanted to win.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.682
I perverted Mother's spell,

13:27.840 --> 13:33.324
put Lucifer in a vessel of my own making
because I wanted to win.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.410
You have any idea how many people

13:36.560 --> 13:39.131
have made a play for my throne
over the years?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.451
Lucifer, Abaddon,

13:41.600 --> 13:42.965
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.531
Too damn many.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.570
I thought if I could
put the Devil on a leash...

13:48.680 --> 13:51.081
My own personal nuke.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.171
No one would ever dare challenge me again.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.084
Yeah. That worked out great.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.649
All ended with me narrowly escaping death
by hiding in a rat.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.327
Wait. In an actual rat?

14:04.560 --> 14:06.164
Wasn't too bad, really.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.086
Gave me time to think.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.208
You know, I've been focused for so long
on keeping my job,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.726
never realized, I hate it.

14:23.080 --> 14:28.723
All those whining demons,
the endless moan of damned souls,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.451
the paperwork, I mean, who wants that?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.481
You?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.126
Once, maybe.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.723
So, why are you here?

14:41.120 --> 14:45.808
Well, whenever
there's a world-ending crisis at hand,

14:45.960 --> 14:47.325
I know where to place my bets.

14:47.960 --> 14:54.570
It's on you. You big, beautiful,
lumbering piles of flannel.

14:57.600 --> 15:02.481
So, if you'll forgive my transgression,
I'll make it worth your while.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.161
Which means?

15:06.280 --> 15:10.330
After we put Lucifer back in his Cage,
together,

15:11.720 --> 15:13.324
I'll seal the gates of Hell.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.041
You'll never see another demon again,
apart from, of course, yours truly.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.049
- You would do that?
- Why not?

15:20.760 --> 15:22.762
They stab me in the back,
I'll happily stab them in the front,

15:22.920 --> 15:25.651
the sides, and right up
their little black-eyed asses.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.929
So, we have a deal?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.521
Cass?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.201
Cass.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.440
Castiel?

16:18.520 --> 16:19.726
Kelly.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.881
Where were you?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.001
I, um...

16:23.720 --> 16:24.767
Uh, nowhere.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.564
Um, is everything okay?

16:30.160 --> 16:31.207
No.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.331
The baby, it's...

16:34.000 --> 16:35.206
I think it's time.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.250
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Don't worry.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.249
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.323
This is what you do when I'm not here?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.121
Type?

17:09.520 --> 17:10.567
Yep.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.324
Wait a second. I got something.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.448
Okay, two hours ago,
there was a massive power outage

17:14.599 --> 17:15.806
in the Pacific Northwest.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.121
Sounds like the right kind of weird.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.009
Oh, yeah. Wait.

17:19.960 --> 17:23.567
They tracked the outage to an address
in North Cove, Washington,

17:23.720 --> 17:28.760
to a house currently being rented
by one James Novak.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.001
That's Cass.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.967
- Let's roll.
- It's about time.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.368
Think we're gonna trust you out there
after what you pulled? Hmm?

17:40.840 --> 17:42.604
No. You stay here,

17:42.760 --> 17:44.000
you sit down and you shut up.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.481
You're all right.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.001
The pressure waves
are still very far apart.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.526
"Pressure waves"?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.010
It's what they...

18:14.160 --> 18:16.891
It's what they called contractions
in my doula class.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.160
I took it online.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.169
First-time mothers,
labor can be 12 to 18 hours.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.367
Sometimes longer.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.690
Though, given
this is the child of Lucifer,

18:34.880 --> 18:37.360
and a quasi-celestial being...

18:37.800 --> 18:39.245
They didn't cover that online?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.560
They did not.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.081
KELLY: <i>Cass?</i>

19:13.080 --> 19:14.411
Thank you.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.366
For everything.

19:21.880 --> 19:22.927
Of course.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.121
Kelly?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.605
Tell me again. Tell me again what you saw.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.127
Right. I saw... I saw...

19:57.080 --> 19:58.206
I saw the future.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.803
I saw a world without pain,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.488
<i>or hunger or want.</i>

20:15.120 --> 20:17.122
I saw the world that this child...

20:18.880 --> 20:22.805
That your child will create.

20:23.840 --> 20:30.200
And it is a world without fear,
and without suffering, and without hate.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.164
I saw paradise.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.725
Dean.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.886
- Cass, is this place warded?
- Yes, heavily.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.241
Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.201
Lucifer?

21:16.240 --> 21:17.605
He could be right behind us.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.568
I don't... What are you doing here...

21:20.720 --> 21:21.881
Saving your ass.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.486
Look, you and Kelly just taking off
was a stupid move.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.800
But there's no way we're letting Lucifer
get his hands on that kid.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.530
That ain't happening.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.767
DEAN: <i>Sam's right.</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:33.251
Okay, we'll work through our crap,
we always do,

21:33.400 --> 21:36.563
but right now we are here to get you,
get Kelly, and get gone.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.526
She can't be moved. She's having a...

21:41.920 --> 21:43.570
I'll check on her.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.881
- How much time do we have?
- We don't know.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.731
Hey, if he shows, can you flame on again?

21:55.640 --> 21:57.404
Can you torch Lucifer like you did Dagon?

21:57.560 --> 21:59.005
I don't know. That...

21:59.160 --> 22:00.400
That wasn't me. That was the child.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.211
And in case you haven't noticed,
he's a little busy.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.562
Son of a bitch.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.731
Here, Dean.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.681
Let me.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.767
Thanks.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.490
All right.
We should double-check the warding.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.281
Wait.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.123
Right. So, listen, if we, uh...

22:26.560 --> 22:28.369
SAM: <i>Cass, what is that?</i>

22:30.880 --> 22:33.121
It's a tear in space and time.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.124
Uh, and that means?

22:36.280 --> 22:38.601
It's a doorway to another world.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.445
- Another... What do... Like Narnia?
- No.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.647
No, through there, it's Earth,

22:43.960 --> 22:45.291
but different. It's a...

22:45.440 --> 22:46.601
It's an alternate reality.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.962
So it's a bizarro world?

22:49.120 --> 22:52.920
Or like the place we got zapped to
where we were actors on a TV show.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.844
- Oh, yeah, the supernatural wasn't real.
- Yeah.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.525
- And you were Polish?
- Right.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.046
Okay, Cass, how did this get here?

23:04.480 --> 23:05.925
The child being born.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.007
His power, it seems to be puncturing
the fabric of our universe.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.524
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.210
And what exactly is on the other side?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.445
You don't want to know.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.171
Probably. But we need to.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.966
Whoa.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.206
DEAN: <i>Cass, what is this?</i>

23:45.400 --> 23:47.721
As I said, it's Earth.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.768
But this Earth is locked in eternal war
between Heaven and Hell.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.730
There are armies of angels
fighting hordes of demons

23:54.880 --> 23:58.327
and the few humans that remain
are caught in between.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.646
How do you know that?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.525
A friend told me.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.608
Oh, good,
now you're making friends. That's...

24:07.640 --> 24:09.927
All right, on a scale of 1 to 10,
how bad is this?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.288
I don't know.

24:12.440 --> 24:16.729
I gotta say, a hole in reality
to a bombed-out apocalypse world?

24:17.680 --> 24:18.681
Gonna go with 11.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.601
Sounds right.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.371
You don't have to worry.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.924
The child, he opened this door.
He'll close it.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.721
You sure about that?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.370
I have faith.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.481
- Really? In your unborn baby-God?
- Yes.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.324
Well, then you're a dumb-ass.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.320
Guys, guys!

24:45.160 --> 24:47.242
- Hey, hands in the air!
- No. Don't.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.087
Bobby?

25:17.920 --> 25:19.126
Do I know you?

25:20.920 --> 25:21.921
Bobby...

25:22.600 --> 25:24.762
Sam. Dean, Cass.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.122
Uh-huh. You say that like it's supposed to
mean something to me,

25:29.280 --> 25:30.770
but, no.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.000
Sam, this is Bobby, but it's not your...

25:35.160 --> 25:38.084
Bobby. It's us.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.480
Sam and Dean Winchester.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.127
The only Winchester I ever heard of
was John.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.521
Yeah, John Winchester, our father.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.047
Doubt it. He's dead.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.122
Been dead over 40 years now.

25:52.240 --> 25:56.131
The only reason I know about him
was this hunter I ran with, Mary Campbell.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.163
You get a few pints of shine into her

25:59.320 --> 26:04.486
and she always told the same story
about the man she loved, John Winchester.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.329
<i>Azazel killed her about 10 years ago.</i>

26:08.320 --> 26:10.322
Cass, what the hell is this?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.889
This is a world where you were never born.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.009
It's a world you never saved.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.607
All right. Okay.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.045
I think they're less
than five minutes apart now,

26:38.240 --> 26:39.287
and it's almost time.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.688
How you doing?

26:45.480 --> 26:47.847
I'm dying-

26:50.960 --> 26:51.961
I know.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.090
But that's okay.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.768
'Cause wouldn't you die for your sons?

27:10.080 --> 27:11.081
Yeah.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.928
When this whatever opened up,

27:19.080 --> 27:22.607
all sorts of alarms went off
back at my place.

27:24.320 --> 27:28.006
I got here just in time to see your boy
get ambushed by a tempter demon.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.960
A what?

27:30.120 --> 27:34.603
It's... Black eyes, pointed teeth, horns.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.603
Wait a second. Demons have horns now?

27:37.160 --> 27:38.446
Whole new world, Sam.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.251
Usually, I gun down flyboys on sight,

27:42.080 --> 27:46.005
but, uh, he looked different.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.403
Wasn't wearing a necklace
made out of baby ears, for one thing.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.727
We got to talking about where I came from
and our two worlds.

27:55.160 --> 28:00.087
From what he says, pretty much
peaches and cream on your side.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.285
I wouldn't say that.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.761
It's better than this.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.842
I don't know. It ain't so bad here,
if you like killing angels.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.046
And you do?

28:12.120 --> 28:14.361
It's my hobby and my passion.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.324
So, I figure it's only a matter of time

28:19.480 --> 28:21.801
before the dicks upstairs
get wind of this.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.285
And when they show...

28:25.440 --> 28:26.805
Me and Rufus go to work.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.364
He's loaded with 100 rounds.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.724
Cast from old angel blades.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.170
Wait, angel-killing bullets?

28:38.040 --> 28:39.565
Awesome.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.681
Okay. Okay.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.125
You're okay.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.561
Are you all right?

29:03.480 --> 29:06.290
No, Cass. Pretty far from all right.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.449
I mean, we got Lucifer on this side,
we've got Mad Max world on that side.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.846
I mean, yeah, we've been down before,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.002
but this,
I mean, I don't even know where to start.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.161
Oh, come on!

29:17.520 --> 29:19.522
Hello, boys. Again.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.966
Wait a second. How the hell did you...

29:22.120 --> 29:23.360
I improvised.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.681
Lucky I did.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.684
Turns out,
I'm the answer to all your problems.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.526
May I speak with her?

29:44.960 --> 29:45.961
Sure.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.326
- Okay...
- Mary...

29:49.640 --> 29:50.880
I'll be back.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.561
Okay.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.006
Cass?

30:05.240 --> 30:06.241
What's wrong?

30:14.240 --> 30:15.571
You ready?

30:16.840 --> 30:18.171
Nope.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.687
When has that ever stopped us?

30:20.880 --> 30:21.881
Yeah.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.806
You know, Cass has faith in this kid.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.726
I hope he's right.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.165
But me, I have faith in us.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.046
You, me, Mom, Cass...

30:38.240 --> 30:40.083
And Crowley. Sometimes.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.010
This is gonna work.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.971
It has to.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.320
Don't worry.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.644
It will be fine.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.131
Remember, paradise.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.729
Well, this is a fun surprise.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.691
<i>I gotta hand it to you guys.
You never give up.</i>

31:23.840 --> 31:25.842
<i>Even when you should.</i>

31:26.000 --> 31:28.924
<i>Even when you would be so stupid not to.</i>

31:29.080 --> 31:32.084
Look, whatever you're planning on doing,
Chuck...

31:32.280 --> 31:35.727
God will stop you
just like he did last time.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.611
You're right.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.807
What should I do?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.048
Oh, God, don't strike me dead!

31:44.120 --> 31:48.648
Come on, Sam.
You sound like a virgin in Jesus camp.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.763
"You can't, God is watching."

31:53.680 --> 31:57.401
No, "Chuck walked." He's gone.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.844
So you're just gonna smash his toys?

32:00.320 --> 32:01.526
Exactly.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.687
'Cause every time I look at this
sad trash fire of a world,

32:05.840 --> 32:07.729
do you know what I keep thinking?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.370
I could do so much better.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.046
So apocalypse take two, that's your plan?

32:13.560 --> 32:15.289
When in doubt, go with the classics.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.442
That's what I always say.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.363
Well, boys, enough with the foreplay.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.805
Let's do this.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.409
See you on the other side, boys.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.568
Well, that worked.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.921
Mature. Real mature.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.726
Hey, guys, I really wanna enjoy this.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.165
Really wanna savor just ripping you apart,

32:55.320 --> 32:58.164
getting all up in there
and getting all gooey.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.609
But, you know,
little slugger's almost here

33:02.760 --> 33:06.003
and, uh, well, I'm on the clock.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.371
Interesting.

33:18.760 --> 33:19.966
Hmm.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.726
Nice.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.970
SAM: <i>You wanted the apocalypse,</i>

33:34.600 --> 33:35.601
you got it.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.688
Sammy. Hey.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.124
Where's your big bro?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.566
DEAN: <i>Right here.</i>

33:45.680 --> 33:47.409
Oh. Sweet toy.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.407
Yeah. I got it off an old...
New pal of mine.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.121
See, we have this bet,
see if it works against an archangel.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.284
So, say hello to my little friend.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.121
Took you long enough.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.641
Come on now, Crowley. Come on.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.440
Yeah, baby! Come on!

34:24.800 --> 34:26.563
We do this ritual, we seal that rift

34:26.719 --> 34:28.051
and we lock the Devil
in this godforsaken place,

34:28.199 --> 34:29.246
<i>that's the plan.</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:31.687
Remember, two birds, one spell.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.005
Right, right. Just hurry.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.846
You lose.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.243
Dead Sea brine,
mercury, lamb's blood, holy oil.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.679
Here we go.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.211
SAM: That's the last of it.
That's everything.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.850
- No, it's not.
- What?

35:09.680 --> 35:13.685
If you wanna heal that rip,
we need one more minor ingredient.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.930
- What?
- A life.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.929
Ah, I could do this all day.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.089
You make such funny noises.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.409
Surprise.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.166
Crowley!

35:45.600 --> 35:47.409
You sneaky little...

35:49.360 --> 35:51.408
So I guess I get to kill you twice,
huh, Crowley?

35:52.440 --> 35:53.566
I doubt it.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.489
Oh, no, no, you had your chance.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.120
You could've put me back in the Cage,

35:58.280 --> 36:00.408
but you had to make it personal,
didn't you?

36:02.960 --> 36:05.486
You're right. It is personal.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.250
You humiliated me.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.609
I... I hate you deeply,

36:15.480 --> 36:16.481
truly.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.766
I'm gonna enjoy wiping that smug,
self-satisfied look off your face.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.761
Personally.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.927
You mean this one?

36:33.760 --> 36:37.890
Come on, Crowley, you know
whatever you try, you're gonna lose.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.527
You're right.

36:53.960 --> 36:54.961
Bye, boys.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.001
Cass?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.250
- Come on, come on!
- Cass!

37:17.400 --> 37:18.925
- Cass, Cass!
- No, no, no. Let's go, we gotta go!

37:32.080 --> 37:33.286
I love you.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.201
Cass.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.521
No!

38:16.200 --> 38:17.690
That was fun.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.207
Seriously, guys, points for trying.

38:21.400 --> 38:25.405
Super impressed, but, uh, playtime's over.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.521
Get away from them.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.685
Marv, right?

38:35.560 --> 38:38.040
Yeah, I've heard about you.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.290
You, uh, are certainly living up
to the hype.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.770
Look, seriously, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.891
I owe you, kid.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.206
Mom, Mom, Mom!

38:52.040 --> 38:53.121
I love you.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.011
Cute.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.766
Is that all you got, Mama?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.281
- Mom?
- Ah!

39:21.600 --> 39:23.090
Mom! Mom! No!

39:28.080 --> 39:29.969
No, no. No.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.764
No!

39:40.760 --> 39:41.921
No.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.007
No, no, no, no.
