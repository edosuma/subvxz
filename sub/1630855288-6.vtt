00:01.168 --> 00:02.085
Previously on
Cruel Summer...

00:02.085 --> 00:03.837
The sheriff's
been digging around.

00:03.837 --> 00:04.755
I had to strike back.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.423
Someone planted it there.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.676
You know Iz.
She's capable of
absolutely anything.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.386
Maybe you aren't that into Luke.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.971
That would be
a good thing because?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.057
Because I think I am.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.976
Everyone already believes that
they saw me on that tape, right?

00:17.976 --> 00:20.812
-Yeah.
-So let's make sure
that it stays that way.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.732
The more that they find out
about you on the night
Luke disappeared,

00:23.732 --> 00:25.526
the more that
they find out about me.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.818
You need to tell
Isabella to leave.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.029
I can't stand to be
around her anymore.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.657
But I think it's best
if you stay somewhere else
while this all plays out.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.867
There's something under my bed
that Megan wanted me
to get rid of.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.995
"When I heard that Luke drowned,
I knew I had to contact you."

00:36.995 --> 00:40.874
"When I was in Chatham
last summer, I realized you
didn't know the full picture."

00:40.874 --> 00:42.334
Oh, my God.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.044

♪ Oh... ♪

01:06.400 --> 01:07.609
You look great.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.152
I love your hair like that.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.612
Thanks.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.948
Thought I'd try something new
for the party today.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.118
So, about that.

01:16.118 --> 01:19.121
-I broke up with Luke.
-You what?

01:19.121 --> 01:22.583
-It's his birthday.
-Which is why I did it
last night.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.043
I couldn't keep seeing him
now that I know how you feel.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.920
-I didn't ask you to do that.
-I know.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.048
I wanted to. He clearly
has feelings for you.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.925
And you guys are like
the end game, so...

01:31.925 --> 01:33.594
Why wait?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.096
Are you sure about this?
I thought you liked him.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.683
It was never going to be
anything more than a summer
fling between the two of us.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
What did he say?
Like, how did he take it?

01:45.105 --> 01:48.191
He was surprised, for sure,
but, um...

01:48.191 --> 01:50.944
he took it pretty well.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.280
Okay.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.742
The party's gonna be a blast.
He'll forget all about me.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.870
Plus, one look at you,

01:59.870 --> 02:01.705
and he'll realize
that what he wants

02:01.705 --> 02:04.041
has been in front of him
this whole time.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.384
Isabella:
Hey.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.470
Almost ready.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.347
I'm so glad we're doing this.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.723
The Chatham Plunge
is the bomb.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.099
Luke and I have never
missed one.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.310
-You're gonna love it.
-(computer chimes)

02:23.310 --> 02:24.728
Wait, how cold is it again?

02:28.190 --> 02:31.068
Um, shoot, I, um...

02:31.068 --> 02:32.444
I'm gonna
have to bail, actually.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.112
-Why?
-I'm sorry, really.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.490
It's, um...
it's this paperwork

02:36.490 --> 02:38.617
that I have to send to U Dub
before the end of the year.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.118
-You can't do it later?
-No.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.995
Deadline's today.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.997
It's for the scholarship,
so it's a big deal.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.916
(computer chimes)

02:49.920 --> 02:51.672
Um, we'll hang tonight.

Debbie:
Did you sleep at all?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.038
Not really.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.209
Luke would have been 18 today.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.547
A year ago, I was planning
his 17th birthday party.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.093
Now there's a memorial instead.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.929
It's so hard
to believe he's gone.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.519
Where did you get the laptop?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.022
A friend.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.399
Who?

Couldn't sleep?

No.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.103
Yeah. Me either.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.608
(sighs)

04:38.737 --> 04:40.697
You know, he...

04:40.697 --> 04:43.116
he would've loved being
the center of attention.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.923
Just... what was it,
DJ Just Stop?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.675
Remember when he used
to try to beatbox?

05:02.052 --> 05:04.095
Yeah.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.139
Yeah, it was just...

05:06.139 --> 05:07.682
spitting everywhere.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.734
I was such a dick to him.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.654
Yeah, you were.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.325
But you're kind of a dick
to everyone, so...

05:28.578 --> 05:29.538
Yeah.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.167
Still, you know,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.253
he didn't deserve it.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.514
(upbeat music playing)

05:57.023 --> 05:59.359
Finally. How long
does it take to get some ice?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.361
(straining)

06:01.361 --> 06:03.530
Had to make a few stops.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.241
Lily's staying at a friend's
and my mom's not getting home
until like 10:00,

06:06.241 --> 06:08.368
so we'll have the whole house
to ourselves for the party.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.870
Something's different.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.332
I showered.
Did you bring the saw horses?

06:14.332 --> 06:16.835
-Yeah, I already set it up.
-Okay. Can you run this
through the living room?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.753
'Cause the socket outside
might blow a fuse.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.299
Just relax, Sarge.
All right? We got this.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.510
Okay. I just want this to be
the best birthday ever.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.262
Get Luke's mind off
of everything.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.015
What, you mean being dumped
like a chump?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.057
Just keep the import

06:31.057 --> 06:32.142
in her trailer

06:32.142 --> 06:33.268
and it'll be fine.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.103
-Dude.
-You know, I always say

06:35.103 --> 06:37.105
that the best way
to get over someone

06:37.105 --> 06:39.190
is to get under someone else.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.776
Right. Well, you say a lot
of crap and no one's buying it.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.407
Just trust me. All right?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.869
This party's gonna be something
that Luke will never forget.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.887
Come on, come on, come on.
One more, one more.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.014
Go, go, go.
There you go, good!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.892
(chuckles) Good!

07:13.892 --> 07:17.228
Now, that's how you build
the power. (chuckles)

07:17.228 --> 07:19.439
I could... I could be
in here all year,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.024
I still wouldn't look
like you.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.194
You see? That attitude right
there is part of your problem.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.613
If you don't lead
with confidence,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.823
bullies can smell that
from a mile away.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.950
It's primal.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.912
Yeah, well,
Brent's more of a primate.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.914
Yeah, well...

07:35.914 --> 07:39.834
family knows how to push buttons
better than anyone.

07:39.834 --> 07:44.339
My dad used to be
a "my way or the highway"
kind of guy.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.008
Used to bully the hell out of me
and my sister when we were kids.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.469
You? I can't see that.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.514
Yep. He didn't want me
to go into law enforcement,

07:52.514 --> 07:54.683
thought it was beneath me.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.059
You didn't listen, though.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.978
Nope.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.939
Biggest lesson I've learned...

08:03.692 --> 08:05.485
was to be my own person.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.030
You know, don't let
people tell you what's what.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.449
Unless it's a beautiful woman.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.785
Then we'll just let 'em think
they call the shots.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.621
But always make sure
you have the final say.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.789
Totally.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.207
All right.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.291

this party started!

08:30.009 --> 08:32.095
Yeah, let's go!

08:32.095 --> 08:34.305
You've killed it, as usual.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.598
Oh, thanks.

08:35.598 --> 08:38.518
I'm not used
to you with the ponytail.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.020
But you always look fly, though.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.273
(guests laughing, joking)

08:43.273 --> 08:45.233
Ah, let me grab
some paper towels.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.568
Eric:
Luke's here!

08:46.568 --> 08:48.695
-(cheering)
-Happy birthday!

08:48.695 --> 08:50.363
Thank you, thank you.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.907
-Happy birthday!
-Oh, wow!

08:52.907 --> 08:54.576
This is rad, Megan, thank you.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.744
What are best friends for?

08:55.744 --> 08:58.246
Getting each other naked wasted?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.539
Uh, is Parker here?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.582
Yeah, she's out back.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.627
He's actually
being really cool today.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.796
He's trying
to make me feel better
in his own screwed-up way,

09:06.796 --> 09:08.214
you know?

09:08.214 --> 09:11.468
Uh, is, uh...
is Isabella here?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.511
Brent thought it'd be weird
for her to be here,

09:13.511 --> 09:15.722
so she's just laying low.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.682
Tell her to come.
I'm cool.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.850
Really?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.188
Yeah, I mean... mostly.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.190
I'll pace myself.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.066
I'll help.

09:29.778 --> 09:30.904
See? Slowing you right down.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.698
What did you do
with your hair?

09:33.698 --> 09:36.367
I haven't seen it
down like this in forever.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.244
Just felt like changing it up.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.457
(laughing, joking)

09:42.457 --> 09:44.042
(in sing-song) Luke!

09:44.042 --> 09:46.586
We have five shots
with your name on them!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.007

-That's all!

(laughter)

09:53.176 --> 09:54.094
Eric:
Ooh!

10:06.731 --> 10:08.775
Are those the police files
on Lisa's death?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.944
-From St. Barts?
-Yeah.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.987
I thought Tom said
those were sealed?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.239
They were.
But I found a way.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.245
Someone who was at the party
said that Isabella

10:20.245 --> 10:22.163
convinced Lisa
to go swimming that night,

10:22.163 --> 10:24.082
even though
she was clearly drunk.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.917
People heard them fighting
in the water

10:25.917 --> 10:27.669
right around the time
that Lisa drowned.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.588
She left St. Barts
that night by helicopter

10:30.588 --> 10:32.757
before anyone
could ask questions.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.135
So she's a fugitive?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.179
The case was closed
due to insufficient evidence.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.890
Seems pretty sufficient to me.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.892
Her parents must've used
their connections

10:42.892 --> 10:44.310
to keep it quiet.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.856
A falling out
with her best friend,

10:47.856 --> 10:49.858
and then someone drowns.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.609
I mean, it's... it's...

10:51.609 --> 10:53.278
Terrible.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.113
Familiar.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.120
Whidbey Island
has the best trails.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.789
I've been going camping there
with my parents
since I was a baby.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.293
(laughing) I'm just
picturing you in your diaper,
just filming everyone.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.920
What you mean, in my diaper?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.422
No, stop.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.841
Luke: What is this?
What are we doing?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.635
-It's called a Hurricane.
-Okay.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.512
-Does it rip your top off?
-You'll see.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.597
Okay, hit that.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.639
Okay.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.102
(laughter)

11:26.102 --> 11:27.437
Do me next!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.147
Did you see that?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.815
Yeah.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.109
So, um...

11:33.109 --> 11:37.572
My parents said I could bring
a friend when we go back
to Whidbey in August.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.532
Uh... would you want to come?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.214
-Megan?
-Hmm?

11:55.798 --> 11:56.925
I get it.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.676
A great party
doesn't host itself.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.720
Uh... Find me later.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.013
Yeah. Totally.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.895
That boy has it bad for you.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.438
I know.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.523
And he's so nice.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.150
I think I have
to break up with him.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.110
(high-pitched voice)
Do I sound silly?

12:16.110 --> 12:18.696
-(laughter)
-Luke: Hey, are you not
going to do the Hurricane?

12:18.696 --> 12:20.406
Are you sure you're not having
second thoughts?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.450
Yeah, I'm positive.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.618
He's all yours.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.924
I told you a couple days ago,
something's up with her.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.717
Yeah. You were right.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.427
I mean, she's never
missed a Plunge.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.098
She was totally coming
until she got that message.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.308
It was probably from Ned.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.395
I swear, it's like
she'll take any excuse
to blow me off lately.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.855
Guess you're taking your trash
out in public now, Chambers.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.317
Hey, Isabella,
can I plunge into you?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.652
You're pathetic.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.070
Wait, you like
an audience, right?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.655
We can just do it right here.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.241
It's not like you've ever
done it with anyone ever.

13:03.241 --> 13:07.453
So why don't you two
go play with yourselves
and leave her alone?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.122
Whatever, dude.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.707
Eric:
You've changed.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.545
Hey, they're assholes, okay?
Don't worry about them.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.714
Eventually they'll
move on to something else.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.258
(sighs) You give them
too much credit.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.843
But thanks.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.225
All right,
are we doing this or what?

13:29.225 --> 13:31.728
-Race you in.

wanted me to get rid of.

Luke:
Thanks.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.956
Megan totally
crushed this party, huh?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.667
-Just like everything else.
-Yeah, so...

14:36.667 --> 14:40.797
traditionally, in our culture,
when you dump someone,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.799
you don't crash their party.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.135
It's whatever.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.553
Ignore him.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.347
It's all good.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.432
I didn't wanna be tied down
senior year anyway.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.228
"Traditionally,
in your culture"?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.313
Where is that, Douchebag Island?

15:01.651 --> 15:04.445
Jack!

15:04.445 --> 15:06.280
We need to talk.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.573
I've gotta go.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.703
It's been almost two weeks,
still no arrests.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.747
What the hell kind of
investigation are you running?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.291
I know today must be incredibly
difficult for you, right?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.751
Sit down,
let's talk about this--

15:18.751 --> 15:21.003
Why are you not charging anyone?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.422
I can't go jumping
at every half-baked theory.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.133
So instead you sit on your ass
and you do nothing?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.771
(door clatters shut)

15:40.481 --> 15:43.359
I'm following the evidence,
seeing where it leads.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.445
It leads straight to Isabella,
if you ask me.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.657
I mean, her fingerprints
were on the gun,

15:49.657 --> 15:52.827
her bag of money
was at the cabin.

15:52.827 --> 15:56.664
Trust me, I am working
around the clock,
leaving no stone unturned.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.126
Um... I'm done waiting, Jack.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.879
I'm hiring an investigator,
someone who can
get the job done,

16:02.879 --> 16:05.882
someone who can get Luke
some real justice.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.475
Jeff:
Wanna team up?

16:16.475 --> 16:17.852
Yeah, sure. Okay.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.439
Okay!

16:21.439 --> 16:23.316
Welcome to the first annual

16:23.316 --> 16:25.651
Luke Chambers Invitational
Beer Pong tournament.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.069
Winner gets a beej!

16:27.069 --> 16:29.113
What if it's a girl, you tool?

16:29.113 --> 16:30.907
-Then you get to give one!
-Yeah.

16:30.907 --> 16:34.285
Uh, it is teams of two, so...

16:36.078 --> 16:38.831
I call Megan as my teammate.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.833
'Cause you have very good
eye-hand combination.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.126
Coordination.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.212
Think you need a break
from the brewskis.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.088
We're gonna drink
right now, anyway.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.590
Sorry, it's his birthday.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.300
It's cool.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.635
We're gonna crush this.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.178
Hell yeah, we are.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.931
Um... wanna play together?

16:54.931 --> 16:56.766
Sure.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.226
(laughing)

17:14.617 --> 17:16.744
I was thinking about you.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.412
Today must be really hard.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.667
Yeah, thanks, um...

17:22.667 --> 17:25.044
I'm actually here
to talk to Megan.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.463
Jack said we should limit
our interactions.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.215
Okay, screw Jack.
He's not delivering justice,

17:29.215 --> 17:30.841
he's not gonna make any demands.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.428
I just need to talk to her.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.847
I'm hearing
all the crazy rumors.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.808
I'm gonna need some answers.

17:38.808 --> 17:39.725
She's not here.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.354
Her car's right there, Debbie.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.279
This stuff in the news...
Megan was pregnant?

17:51.279 --> 17:53.155
Isabella's money at the cabin?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.825
If the girls
are hiding something,
I need to know what it is.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.369
And I need to hear it
out of Megan's mouth.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.579
Please.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.831
I wish I could help.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.208
Debbie.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.210
She's not home.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.461
Okay.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.010
You can't hide her forever.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.356
Oh! You look like a drowned rat.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.567
I grabbed the wrong towel.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.485
Yeah, I almost feel bad for you.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.865
C'mere.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.199
(laughing) Really?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.243
-Yeah, you can share.
-Thank you, thank you.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.624
(Isabella sighs)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
This is a dumb
American tradition.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.127
Yeah, I know.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.254
That's why we only do it
once a year.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.758
It takes us a full 12 months
to forget how cold the water is.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.009
Oh, my God.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.347
He wears that thing all year.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.354
Ned: I'm glad you could come.
I could really use your help.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.732
Megan:
Wow, Ned, your house is huge.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.568
Thanks. I don't get
a lot of visitors here.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.988
-(buzzer sounds)
-(door rattles)

19:21.994 --> 19:23.245
Whoa. Uh...

19:32.588 --> 19:34.423
Cool, you have fiber in here.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.841
Yeah.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.635
I've been reading about that.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.180
Oh, uh...

19:41.180 --> 19:43.349
Let's... get to work here.

19:43.349 --> 19:47.645
So, uh, my security software.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.563
Designed it myself.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.525
I have window and door sensors
throughout the house

19:52.525 --> 19:54.402
and they check in
with the server

19:54.402 --> 19:56.320
every minute, on the minute.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.865
So, if anything happens
that's not supposed to,

19:59.865 --> 20:03.202
like a door or a window opens
even just a crack,

20:03.202 --> 20:07.331
the sensors don't call home
and the system locks down.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.874
Okay.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.335
So on New Year's,

20:11.335 --> 20:14.171
when the calendar
jumps ahead to 2000

20:14.171 --> 20:16.298
and the system clock
turns over...

20:16.298 --> 20:18.092
you're afraid that the sensors
won't call home?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.635
Right.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.804
And the system won't
register the new time,

20:21.804 --> 20:23.472
and it'll lock down the house?

20:23.472 --> 20:26.142
Precisely. That's why I need
to kick the tires on this

20:26.142 --> 20:27.643
ahead of Y2K.

20:27.643 --> 20:32.356
So, why don't you go ahead
and roll the clocks forward,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.483
and we'll see
if it goes haywire?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.569
Okay.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.196
I really appreciate you asking
me to do this, by the way.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.074
Um... you've been so helpful
the last couple of months,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.577
answering all my questions
and giving advice.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.079
I feel like I can trust you.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.165
You can. I got this.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.721
(buzzer sounds, lock clicks)

21:11.854 --> 21:13.981
(cheering)

21:13.981 --> 21:15.816
All right, let's go, baby bro.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.318
Smash that ho.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.611
All right, let's take it easy.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.029
Shut your face, Brent.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.242
Nobody beats Team Chambers, bro.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.745
Megan's took all your shots.
You've hit, like, two?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.580
Yeah. But this ball's
got your name

21:29.580 --> 21:30.956
written all over it,
birthday boy.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.500
Yeah, it does. Here we go.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.211
(guests groan)

21:35.211 --> 21:37.880
-Aah! So close.
-(Megan laughs)

21:37.880 --> 21:40.174
Luke talks big,
but he can't deliver.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.842
-Why don't you show them
how it's done?
-Okay.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.681
(cheering)

21:49.183 --> 21:51.268
Luke:
Whoa! Oh!

21:51.268 --> 21:52.353
(laughing)

21:56.982 --> 21:58.984
Just bone, already.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.570
Yeah, all this foreplay's
giving us blue balls.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.207
Smile.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.461
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.838
No worries.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.383
Hey, this is cool.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.094
You know, chilling with you.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.262
Yeah.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.434
I don't think Megan's
into me anymore.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.896
No!

22:35.896 --> 22:37.231
No, she loves you.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.275
She's just...

22:39.275 --> 22:40.609
She's going through something.

22:42.319 --> 22:46.490
Well, you were going through
something last summer too.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.242
I don't get it,
is it something that I did?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.286
No. Not at all.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.829
Well, then what is it?

22:54.540 --> 22:57.376
I broke up with you
when I found out
that Megan liked you.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.462
Don't look so surprised.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.091
You liked her,
it was pretty obvious.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.427
You guys were just destined
to be together.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.349
(relaxing rock music playing)

23:18.898 --> 23:21.275
Sit right there
and drink this soda.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.693
I think your liver
needs a reboot.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.572
(siren chirps)

23:26.572 --> 23:30.576
Oh... Hide the booze,
the cops are here!

23:30.576 --> 23:32.620
woman over radio:
Hands in the air! Nobody move!

23:32.620 --> 23:34.038
Please don't arrest me.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.831
Brent:
Uh, what's your name?

23:35.831 --> 23:37.416
That's not a real cop,
you idiot.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.336
(laughs) What's your name,
sweetheart?

23:40.336 --> 23:41.670
I'm Officer Bunny.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.173
-(guests murmuring)
-Who's the birthday boy?

23:44.173 --> 23:46.800
Uh, right here, Officer Bunny.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.427
Take him downtown
for questioning.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.762
Do a strip search.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.640
Probe him
with your night stick.

23:52.640 --> 23:57.519
I hear you've been
very, very bad.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.980
You have no idea.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.359
Yeah, you guys,
you can go in the Airstream.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.862

24:42.606 --> 24:45.150
Hi, Trevor,
it's Megan Landry calling.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.528
Again.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.029
I got your letter.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.823
We need to talk.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.753
Officer Bunny:
Ooh!

25:04.753 --> 25:06.505
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.424
(Luke laughs awkwardly)

25:11.301 --> 25:13.679
-Are you ready to get excited?
-Luke: I'll just... okay.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.639
Officer Bunny:
Hmm.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.683
(Officer Bunny continues,
voice muffled)

25:23.522 --> 25:27.317
Luke: You have taken
so many hits for Megan.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.028
I mean...

25:29.028 --> 25:30.362
(scoffs)

25:30.362 --> 25:32.031
...breaking up with me,

25:32.031 --> 25:34.992
and taking the fall
for the sex tape.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.411
Yeah.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.372
She's my sister.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.999
I know that she
would do the same for me.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.379
Maybe I do give up
too much, though.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.673
But loyalty's everything to me.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.467
Do you ever regret it?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.179
Never.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.101
I still think about you.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.149
The hell?

26:07.149 --> 26:08.692
I'm-I'm... Hold on.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.361
Wait, I'm sorry, I thought
that you were feeling it.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.947
You thought wrong.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.240
We should go.

26:19.787 --> 26:20.829
-Okay, girls, ready?
-Yeah.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.790
Okay. So you throw...

26:22.790 --> 26:24.958
hip, right...

26:24.958 --> 26:26.752
hip... Ooh, nice!

26:26.752 --> 26:29.505
(laughs) You step out, twirl.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.507
Twirl...
You got it, you got it.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.175
And then you do
the genie thing.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.469
Ow! You guys look so good!

26:35.469 --> 26:37.137
No, get in here, Megan!

26:37.137 --> 26:38.764
Uh, no, I can't dance.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.724
Come on. Just follow me.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.186
Follow me.
I'm sure you'll get it.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.145
Like this.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.857
No, no, you gotta control
your hips more.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.110
Looking good, it's looking good.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.694
Like your body's made
of caramel.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.530
Wait. Why caramel?

26:54.530 --> 26:56.907
Uh, because it's sweet
and stretchy?

26:56.907 --> 26:58.700
(laughing)

26:58.700 --> 27:00.160
This is kind of fun.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.328
Mm-hmm.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.247
Fun and hot.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.707
It's not the worst way
to get somebody to notice you.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.964
-(guys laughing)
-Brent: There's the man.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.423
Give us all the deets.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.716
You get a lap dance?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.636
She danced on more
than just my lap.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.179
That's what I'm talking about!

27:19.179 --> 27:22.182
Us Chambers men, we get it done!

27:22.182 --> 27:23.725
Come on, dude, you're my hero!

27:23.725 --> 27:25.602
Brent: You see that?
Did you see that?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.312
Total stud.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.564
(keying rapidly)

27:45.330 --> 27:47.249
Ned? I'm done.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.379
(buzzer sounds, lock clicks)

27:52.379 --> 27:54.172
This is really nice.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.967
This is my shrine to the past.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.511
Oh, that-- that was my baby.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.346
-Can I?
-Yeah, please.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.768
It never made it
to market, 'cause...

28:06.768 --> 28:08.437
the company fired me
and shelved it.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.235
I grew up poor, you know.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.697
I taught myself coding
and climbed the ladder.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.909
So when I got fired,
I thought my life was over.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.703
But now I make my own rules.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.580
I'm in control.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.625
Yeah, that's what I want.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.461
My boyfriend thinks
I'm obsessed.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.422
Mostly he just doesn't
really get it.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.800
He hasn't found that thing
that he loves yet.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.595
He'll probably just end up
joining the family business.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.765
Ah, the Chambers dynasty.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.391
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.437
They would.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.648
His father thinks
he's above the law

28:52.648 --> 28:54.608
and everyone should
bend to his will.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.319
Fellow like that
doesn't have a lot of time
for other opinions.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.116
Yeah, well... Luke's...
he's not like that.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.994
Maybe not yet.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.706
But... the apple doesn't
usually fall far. (chuckles)

30:48.805 --> 30:50.182
About Lisa.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.485
How did you find out?

31:01.485 --> 31:04.196
Trevor.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.364
His visit makes
a ton more sense now.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.370
I started to tell you a hundred
different times about Lisa--

31:12.370 --> 31:16.666
But you didn't. You know,
you have told so many lies,

31:16.666 --> 31:18.502
and they're all
to make you look good.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.462
I'm telling you the truth
about Lisa--

31:20.462 --> 31:22.839
You've been lying
since the day you got here.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.884
Lying about your past,
lying about our friendship.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.177
Everything!

31:29.513 --> 31:31.640
I've read the police report.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.352
It was your idea to go swimming.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.770
And then she drowned.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.899
No.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.237
Lisa jumped in the water
on her own.

31:47.739 --> 31:52.244
She was drunk, upset.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.579
I went after her to make sure
that she was okay.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.623
And then she was gone.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.377
It was the worst night
of my life.

32:02.796 --> 32:03.755
I should've told you.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.509
I wish I had.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.638
(relaxing music in background)

32:11.638 --> 32:13.765
I'm not sure you're gonna be
able to top this next year.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.308
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.726
First rule of birthday cake is--

32:16.726 --> 32:18.812
What? Don't talk about
birthday cake or something?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.647
Yes.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.357
Okay, fine, screw it.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.032
Whoa, this is so good.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.325
-Did you make this?
-Mm-hmm.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.996
This has been...

32:35.996 --> 32:37.873
like an almost perfect day.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.251
You know I like
getting an A in everything.

32:44.129 --> 32:47.340
Is there something else
that could make it more perfect?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.558
You know, I've missed
hanging with you this summer.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.896
Like just the two of us.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.150
Yeah, me too.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.161
Oh, crap, I'm sorry, I'm...

33:16.161 --> 33:18.246
I'm like, I'm gonna be sick.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.503
Hi.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.009
You couldn't come
to the Plunge, so...

33:31.009 --> 33:32.761
I'm bringing the Plunge to you.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.682
'99 will make the annual
collection after all.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.686
Thank you. It's sweet.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.064
Did you and Isabella have fun?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.318
Honestly, you were the...

33:48.318 --> 33:49.819
you're the only thing
that was on my mind.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.242
You know, I miss you.

33:56.826 --> 33:57.744
I miss us.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.248
These last few days
really sucked.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.085
I miss you too.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.339
Let's start fresh.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.341
Okay?

34:11.341 --> 34:12.926
Let's catch up.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.344
Tell me about your day.
What'd you get up to?

34:18.265 --> 34:20.141
I have a better idea.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.791
Hey.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.297
You've been kind of quiet today.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.342
Just enjoying the show.

34:56.636 --> 35:01.600
It's been really educational,
in a crappy kind of way.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.642
I'm confused.

35:05.353 --> 35:10.275
I saw it before, a while back.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.861
But then it felt
like things had changed.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.115
I thought we had something good.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.452
What are you talking about?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.913
You and Luke.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.958
It's so obvious.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.503
He's the one you wanna
be with, not me.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.716
It's his birthday.

35:34.716 --> 35:39.512
Every time I turned around today
you were with him.

35:39.512 --> 35:44.684
And when you weren't with him,
you were talking about him.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.895
Worrying about him.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.231
He's my best friend
and he just got dumped.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.150
Yeah. Lucky for you.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.860
That's not fair.

35:53.860 --> 35:58.114
What's not fair is me being
used as your practice run.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.493
That's not what it's like.

36:04.454 --> 36:09.000
You can lie to yourself, Megan,
but you can't lie to me.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.131
We're done.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.230
Why should I believe you, Iz?

36:30.230 --> 36:32.357
I never lied about us.

36:32.357 --> 36:36.861
I tried to be a better friend
to you than I was to Lisa.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.030
That's why I pretended to be
the one on the sex tape,

36:39.030 --> 36:41.700
to protect you.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.368
The whole time,

36:43.368 --> 36:46.996
even after everything that
happened on New Year's Eve,

36:46.996 --> 36:48.957
I had your back.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.542
Did you?

36:50.542 --> 36:53.336
Or were you just covering
your ass after what you did?

36:53.336 --> 36:57.632
I think that you went back
to the cabin on New Year's,

36:57.632 --> 37:00.635
and you killed Luke,
just like you killed Lisa.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.565
I haven't laughed
that hard in a long time.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.776
I will never look at a pie
the same way again.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.946
I've got that wine
that Wayne Bright sent
from his vineyard.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.490
Steve:
Sounds great.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.284
Hey! How was the party?

37:24.284 --> 37:26.453
It was really fun.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.414
Yeah? The birthday boy
didn't overdo it, I take it?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.624
Nope. Brent had his back.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.460
Well, if everyone had
a good time

37:33.460 --> 37:36.629
and the cops didn't come,
that is a hit in my book.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.006
-Steve: Mm.
-(glasses clink)

37:40.550 --> 37:41.634
What'd you guys do?

37:41.634 --> 37:43.428
Got dinner, saw a movie.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.100
We...

37:50.477 --> 37:52.187
It was really funny.

37:54.856 --> 37:55.899
Cool.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.113
Um...

38:02.113 --> 38:04.407
Did that look like a,
you know...?

38:04.407 --> 38:05.575
A date?

38:05.575 --> 38:08.161
This one time at band camp...

38:08.161 --> 38:09.829
(Debbie laughing)

38:09.829 --> 38:13.458
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's on.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.375
(laughs)

38:18.296 --> 38:20.799
I'm really glad you came over.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.676
We needed time together, alone.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.723
I'm sorry, I've been kind of
weird the last few days.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.141
That's okay.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.022
Just... you and Isabella...

38:36.022 --> 38:39.359
when it comes to money,
you guys are on a completely
different planet than I am.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.653
It's not your fault,
it's just...

38:41.653 --> 38:43.154
sometimes it's hard.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.033
I get that.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.287
But that doesn't matter.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.043
Anyway, I just...

38:57.043 --> 39:01.297
I really appreciate
how you let me be me.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.715
Even when I suck.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.387
You couldn't suck if you tried.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.317
Megan, something...

39:21.317 --> 39:24.571
something happened
at the Plunge today.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.197
What kind of something?

39:30.243 --> 39:32.620
Me and Isabella...

39:32.620 --> 39:35.498
we weren't fighting, you know.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.458
We were...

39:37.458 --> 39:40.587
It was like old times.
You know, we were cool.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.380
Okay, you're kind of
freaking me out.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.506
What happened?

39:54.559 --> 39:55.685
She kissed me.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.645
And, uh...

39:57.645 --> 39:59.814
Look, I-I-- Look,
I shut it down right away

39:59.814 --> 40:01.399
and I drove her right home.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.320
I can't believe her.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.699
I thought you should know.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.927
Hey, sweetheart.
This is a nice surprise.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.763
I, um... I just heard something.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.558
And I think you should know.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.534
We need to talk.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.163
Where did you get those?

40:57.163 --> 40:58.706
They were in the Airstream.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.005
Did Isabella give them to you?

41:08.508 --> 41:10.009
Is that Luke's blood?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.139
You think I killed him.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.226
I love you.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.688
There's nothing
I won't do for you.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.232
But I need to know
what happened.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.901
And what if you don't
like what you hear?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.412
(somber theme song playing)
