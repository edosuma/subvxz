WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:08.967
-Whoa!

00:12.470 --> 00:14.514
Put him down. Shut up!

00:21.104 --> 00:23.148
Tell me where the Jomsvikings live.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.525
No one knows where they live.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.362
All we are told
is that believers in the old ways

00:29.446 --> 00:30.655
who come to this beach

00:30.739 --> 00:34.325
will be taken away
to a new Uppsala called Jomsborg.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.455
So the Jomsvikings just find you?

00:39.080 --> 00:43.251
Odin sends them
like Valkyries to carry you to safety?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.129
And if they are lucky,

00:47.005 --> 00:49.340
to take their revenge
on Christians like you.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.728
-Father.
-No. Please.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.825
To become king,
you must bloody your sword.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.828
-Send this pagan to hell!

01:25.251 --> 01:27.712
Send the message, "We're in control."

01:36.304 --> 01:37.347
Now!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.278
Your father would be proud.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.145
Welcome, Freydis!

03:10.273 --> 03:12.108
Freydis, Savior of Kattegat.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.819
Welcome, Freydis!

03:16.321 --> 03:17.697
Welcome, Freydis!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.492
She killed Jarl Kåre.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.286
-Hello.
-Freydis.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.705
Hello.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.291
Welcome, Freydis!

03:30.752 --> 03:31.669
Freydis.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.714
The Keeper of the Faith.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.549
The leaders of Jomsborg.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.102
Freydis, I am Harekr.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.813
Welcome to Jomsborg.

03:52.148 --> 03:52.982
Thank you.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.360
This is Gudrid.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.200
Novgorod, my friend.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.870
Soon, we will be treated like kings.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.063
What are they doing?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.274
Opium.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.028
They say its smoke
enters your body and steals your soul.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.822
Why would they do it?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.825
To escape this Earth.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.244
To talk to the dead.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.960
I think I found my uncle.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.620
That's him. Let's go.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.339
Let me by. I'm Prince Harald Sigurdsson.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.758
I'm here to see my uncle, Yaroslav.

06:23.841 --> 06:24.675
Wait.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.393
Here, take it.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.943
Hey! What this fight needs is a Viking

06:42.026 --> 06:44.570
named Prince Harald Sigurdsson of Norway,

06:45.279 --> 06:47.615
great-grandson of Harald Finehair

06:47.698 --> 06:51.411
and blood relative
of the esteemed Yaroslav the Wise.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.412
Stop!

07:00.878 --> 07:01.712
Harald?

07:03.840 --> 07:04.674
Uncle.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.759
Look at you.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.554
What has brought you to Novgorod?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.683
It's a long story, Uncle.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.436
One told better over food and drink.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.160
So your family
hates the Vikings and Canute.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.872
That's nothing new.
Lots of people feel that way.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.457
But you were different.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.876
You came to London
to do something about it.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.838
There is nothing else to tell you.

07:43.921 --> 07:44.964
We found gold.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.842
In your lodgings. Someone paid you.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.636
I need a name. A description.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.972
I never saw him.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.809
Since you do not know
what this man looks like,

07:57.935 --> 08:00.062
your eyes are of no use to me.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.862
-He was not from the north.
-How do you know?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.071
His words.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.617
He left gold for me
and instructions in the alehouses.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.744
He was from the south.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.370
I need a name.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.292
I know nothing more.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.338
No.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.758
Think harder.

08:32.970 --> 08:37.808
-I heard someone call him "Bear"!

08:48.861 --> 08:50.363
Did he operate alone?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.322
He says so.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.077
His family are from Northumbria.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.247
They lost their lands
when Canute gave the shire to Jarl Nori.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.500
He claims he was paid
by someone from the south. "Bear."

09:04.001 --> 09:05.086
Or Barr.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.380
It's a familiar name,

09:07.463 --> 09:10.091
perhaps an invented one
to protect a family member.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.343
How will you find out?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.805
He has another eye.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.197
That's good! Attack! That's good!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.955
You trained them well.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.501
Great compliment
from a shield maiden of Kattegat.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.672
Perhaps you will share
some of your training with us.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.236
Now we will see what she's made of.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.281
We'll see if the stories are true.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.678
Uh, uh, uh.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.342
I'm sorry.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.097
No. I learned much.

11:21.972 --> 11:22.932
We all did.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.101
Thank you, Freydis.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.770
-Ah!

11:29.313 --> 11:30.147
Jorundr.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.191
Tide's leaving, time to go.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.903
I remember
when you learned your first lesson.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.115
Every time I look at your nose I remember.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.324
Where are they going?

11:41.033 --> 11:44.453
Jorundr is making a run
back to the north to pick up refugees.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.872
If he's successful,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.500
he will bring them here
where they will be safe.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.630
Did you and Harekr
have other children besides Jorundr?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.134
Jorundr is not Harekr's child.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.512
My husband was Harekr's brother.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.725
He was killed in a raid
when Jorundr was a child.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.644
Harekr raised him as his own.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.438
They are close.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.443
Tell me about your baby's father.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.280
How did you know I am with child?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.283
The way you protected your belly.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.785
He is a good man.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.791
I miss him, but we're…

12:32.793 --> 12:34.295
We are now on different paths.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.424
You are in a good place, Freydis.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.554
A new child
is to be celebrated in Jomsborg.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.432
Especially yours.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.186
Open the gates!

12:59.195 --> 13:03.240
So we hear
that Canute has kept the crown of England.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.328
And installed
his son, Svein, as king of Norway.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.455
A crown he promised to me.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.291
And your brother, Olaf?
Does he not have a claim?

13:12.374 --> 13:15.503
He was defeated
by Sweyn Forkbeard in Kattegat,

13:15.586 --> 13:17.963
who then made him
his grandson's protector.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.511
Lord Vitomir, this is my nephew,
Harald Sigurdsson, Prince of Norway.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.346
Vitomir is from Chude,

13:25.429 --> 13:29.016
a kingdom where the women
are all breathtakingly beautiful,

13:29.099 --> 13:31.393
and the men
inspire envy with their strength.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.271
Welcome to Novgorod, Prince Harald.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.358
What has brought you here?

13:37.942 --> 13:41.487
Well, like many in this room,
I find myself a refugee.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.199
Waiting for the route to Constantinople
to open once again.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.077
And what has closed it?

13:48.577 --> 13:49.829
The Pechenegs.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.414
Pechenegs?

13:52.498 --> 13:54.250
Brutal, nomadic warriors.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.502
Now camped along the Dnieper River.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.381
Excellent horsemen, but savages.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.885
They skin their victims alive
and collect their skulls as drinking mugs.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.304
It has been 17 months

14:07.388 --> 14:10.307
since a trading boat
passed from Kodak to the Black Sea.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.395
Our warehouses now strain
with goods that have nowhere to go

14:14.478 --> 14:16.856
and my tables overflow with guests.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.567
Greenlander!

14:21.485 --> 14:24.280
They have language
at the edge of the world, don't they?

14:25.906 --> 14:27.241
Last time I was there.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.120
And tell us, what it is like
to live so removed from civilization.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
Yes, tell us!

14:35.082 --> 14:37.877
Greenland is… quiet.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.300
Quiet and?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.304
Gives you time to think about things.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.976
At night, we would watch the <i>norörljós.</i>

14:55.561 --> 15:01.275
Colors of all the heavens
would light up the sky.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.362
We heard stories when we were younger

15:06.196 --> 15:09.575
that they were
the reflections of the Valkyries' armor.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.287
Or…

15:15.372 --> 15:16.457
when the moon is low,

15:17.833 --> 15:20.794
and the sea is sleeping,

15:21.879 --> 15:26.508
you can hear the <i>söngr</i> of the <i>hvalr</i>
swimming at the bottom of the world.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.887
Then, all at once,

15:31.221 --> 15:32.806
they explode from the darkness.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.269
Mouths open wide enough
to swallow a whole ship.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.192
I hated Greenland when I lived there.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.196
Now I miss it.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.116
I miss the people I knew there.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.453
I understand that.

15:55.162 --> 15:59.458
Welcome to Novgorod,
where unfortunately, quiet does not exist.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.466
I like him.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.763
Uncle, I've come to ask for a favor.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.349
An army.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.978
So you can return to Norway and take
what you feel is rightfully yours.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.895
Yes.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.233
I'm afraid you have come
a long way for nothing, nephew.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.734
I cannot help you.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.736
Cannot? Or will not?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.698
Novgorod is at peace.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.366
But not without problems.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.660
With our southern trade route blocked

16:34.743 --> 16:38.956
I need Canute's northern empire
more than ever, especially England.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.458
I cannot risk
upsetting him or his crazy father

16:41.542 --> 16:44.253
just so that you can fight
for something you never had!

16:50.342 --> 16:54.096
As I see it, beloved nephew,
you have two choices.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.516
Return to Kattegat
and swear fealty to Olaf.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.434
No.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.186
Or do
what Vikings have always done.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.607
Reinvent themselves.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.786
The Skuld
weaves the fates of gods and men.

17:17.870 --> 17:22.207
And now your fate
has been woven into ours.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.084
I have felt this.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.629
But I do not understand how.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.759
Would you be willing
to become Gudija of this temple?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.595
I am a warrior.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.514
-Not a Gudija.
-Ah.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.267
I think that is not true.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.814
I think you came to us
for a greater purpose than as a warrior.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.193
I think you're here

17:50.235 --> 17:54.114
to help the believers
of the old ways find a better life.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.118
Your sword, may I see it?

18:16.845 --> 18:20.140
Refugees we brought here
told us much about you, Freydis.

18:20.224 --> 18:24.144
They say the last Gudija in Uppsala

18:24.853 --> 18:27.189
gave it to you
before the shrine was destroyed.

18:28.982 --> 18:29.983
She did.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.736
Do you not feel
there was purpose to her act?

18:35.364 --> 18:37.616
Who, but you has the right to begin again?

18:38.992 --> 18:40.244
Begin what?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.996
To build a new Uppsala.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.834
Here.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.670
Did no one tell you you had been chosen?

18:55.467 --> 18:59.471
In Uppsala, an ancient one appeared to me.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.683
He told me I had been chosen,

19:04.059 --> 19:06.186
but when the people called for my help…

19:08.147 --> 19:09.565
I did not help them.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.192
He spoke the truth. I…

19:14.695 --> 19:16.113
I ran from Kattegat.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.831
Had you stayed,
you would have no choice to make now.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.587
Perhaps here, not Kattegat…

19:35.799 --> 19:37.509
is the real test of your calling.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.578
<i>Almudhanib.</i>

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
We call it the <i>koma.</i>

20:10.417 --> 20:12.920
It's a thing of beauty
in any language.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.256
Many believe it a bad omen.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.178
People are always afraid
of things they don't understand.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.973
So do you understand it?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.975
Fully? No.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.355
But I know
it is not the skull of the giant Ymir

20:31.438 --> 20:33.190
or a harbinger of evil.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.985
It is more probably
made of rocks and vapors,

20:37.069 --> 20:39.238
reflecting the light of the Sun.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.783
And I know from writings of the ancients

20:42.866 --> 20:45.244
that this is not
its first visit over our heads.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.330
So I am not afraid.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.999
You know much about the heavens.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.419
I am one
who studies the elements in the skies.

20:55.837 --> 20:56.797
I came to Novgorod

20:56.880 --> 21:00.133
to look for the burning rocks
that fall to Earth.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.468
Rocks from the sky?

21:03.178 --> 21:05.639
-Did you find any?
-Yes.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.475
They are easier to find in the snow.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.396
My name is Mariam.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.109
I am Leif.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.278
Leif Eriksson.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.738
Mmm.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.785
It is too cold for me, Leif Eriksson.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.430
Throw me the line!

21:52.853 --> 21:53.854
Hold it!

21:57.482 --> 21:58.483
This way!

22:02.279 --> 22:04.156
There is food for you all.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.784
But first, you must hand in your weapons.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.789
For safekeeping, my friend.

22:15.125 --> 22:15.959
For you.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.419
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.137
It was my father's.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.140
Come.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.979
They are believers in the old ways.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.773
Just like us.

22:38.815 --> 22:39.941
They are not a threat.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.069
We don't know that.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.906
We don't ask where they come from.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.075
It's better to be careful.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.243
Where do they go from here?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.287
We take them into the forest.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.791
Where they can work and live in peace.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.627
Doing what?

22:58.710 --> 23:02.464
They help make the weapons we use
to protect them from the Christian threat.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.802
The right to live in peace
requires everyone to do their part.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.942
You are Freydis,
the shield maiden from Kattegat.

23:22.025 --> 23:22.943
I am.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.654
We looked for you after Kattegat fell.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.365
There were no leaders to help us.

23:30.325 --> 23:33.203
The gods have provided what you asked for.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.621
Welcome.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.041
She's right.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.587
I ran and I was not there for any of them.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.266
Where is my son?

24:36.349 --> 24:39.060
Do not worry. I've taken good care of him.

24:44.733 --> 24:45.609
Mother.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.612
Whose blood is that?

24:49.613 --> 24:51.156
I killed a pagan.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.200
Why? Was he threatening you?

24:53.283 --> 24:54.117
No.

24:54.784 --> 24:58.997
He did give us important information
we wanted about the Jomsvikings.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.415
The Jomsvikings?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.794
Heathen warriors
who live somewhere across the water.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.589
If we are to build a strong Norway,

25:07.672 --> 25:10.300
we must find
their hidden fortress and destroy them.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.844
It is an important job.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.475
Go and wash yourself.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.398
I want Olaf to eat with us tonight.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.948
I'll have you know
I do not allow dogs at my table.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.699
A dog can be very loyal.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.622
And comforting when one is alone.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
Liv!

26:03.812 --> 26:04.646
Liv.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.594
I'm looking for someone who came in here.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.768
You can see all who are here.

26:45.812 --> 26:49.566
They say if you inhale the smoke,

26:51.443 --> 26:52.736
you can talk to the dead.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.279
Yes.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.199
Many talk to their families,

26:58.825 --> 27:00.452
friends they have lost.

27:02.078 --> 27:07.042
For a moment, there's no wall
between the living and the dead.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.464
A thousand. For everything.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.883
No. One for three. One for three.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.802
I have a new plan.

27:19.262 --> 27:23.767
Yaroslav will not back
an army for me, so I will fund my own.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.978
I intend to buy
as many furs as possible here

27:27.062 --> 27:28.730
and sell them in Constantinople.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.483
And how do you plan to get there?

27:33.193 --> 27:35.779
I will worry
about that detail tomorrow, my friend.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.990
Today we must make money.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.533
Doing what?

27:41.660 --> 27:42.869
What we're good at.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.206
-Who wants to bet against Kaysan,

27:47.165 --> 27:50.210
the great African warrior?

27:52.671 --> 27:55.173
No one will bet against Kaysan?

28:00.136 --> 28:04.808
Maybe some of you
will bet against Kaysan now!

28:07.018 --> 28:09.979
-I'll bet against both of them!

28:10.063 --> 28:11.398
Two against two.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.652
Vikings against the world.

28:22.951 --> 28:23.785
Harald.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.748
-Come on. We need the money, right?
-You're the one who needs the money.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.419
What do you say?

28:32.502 --> 28:33.586
Kaysan!

28:36.256 --> 28:37.632
I have a better idea.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.718
This is what we want!

28:41.010 --> 28:44.389
If this man accepts my bet of 100 hryvnya,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.642
I'll fight against both of his fighters.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.852
One hundred hryvnya?

28:54.482 --> 28:56.568
-I accept.
-You'll be fighting!

29:00.488 --> 29:01.948
Rip off his head!

29:02.824 --> 29:03.742
Don't worry.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.077
I'll try not to kill your brother.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.121
I can't promise he'll return the favor.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.800
Come on! Get him!

29:39.569 --> 29:41.112
-Yes!
-Come on!

30:03.134 --> 30:04.344
Yeah!

30:06.346 --> 30:08.973
-See what you're missing?
-Yes, looks like fun.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.897
Watch the left of the big one.
He's slow to defend.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.443
-Kill the Viking!
-Fighters ready?

30:40.338 --> 30:41.214
Come on!

31:14.038 --> 31:15.206
Get him! Go!

31:19.377 --> 31:20.545
Hey!

31:23.423 --> 31:25.633
That's not fair.
You can't bring in someone fresh.

31:25.717 --> 31:29.012
They are brothers.
Your man must defeat both to win.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.983
Come on! Beat him!

31:59.459 --> 32:01.544
-Kaysan, come!
-Hey!

32:03.254 --> 32:04.255
Go, go, go!

32:07.634 --> 32:11.888
We won! We won! It's over. We won! Leif!

32:13.431 --> 32:16.309
-What happened?
-We won! Let's collect our winnings.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.937
Where did he go?
Where is my money? Where is he?

32:19.020 --> 32:20.563
I want my money!

32:21.147 --> 32:22.315
Hey, where did they go?

32:23.274 --> 32:24.108
Leif!

32:26.861 --> 32:29.697
So where shall we go? You hungry?

32:32.033 --> 32:33.993
That was a most impressive fight.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.996
We lost money, Lord Vitomir.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.581
I cannot help you.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.172
Actually, I think that you can.

32:48.132 --> 32:52.595
I must transport something of great worth
to the emperor in Constantinople.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.516
I think you could
be the man to help me get there.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.895
I will pay you, of course.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.190
Handsomely.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.736
How handsomely?

33:10.279 --> 33:11.489
One thousand hryvnya.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.534
Half now, half when we arrive.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.667
Two thousand.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.461
All now.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.648
We will eat without my son.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.483
As you wish.

33:47.567 --> 33:50.862
I do not wish. You exhausted the boy.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.038
So it is just us.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.041
I trust no one
in this godforsaken country.

34:04.959 --> 34:08.963
Including me? I'm a prisoner, like you.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.594
Tell me about these Jomsvikings.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.222
Why do a group of pirates
command your attention?

34:18.306 --> 34:20.767
They may also
be harboring my brother Harald,

34:21.768 --> 34:24.896
to whom Canute
promised the throne of Norway.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.861
If I know my brother,
he will do anything to gain it.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.074
Including getting rid of your son.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.577
And that deserves my attention.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.413
Still, if you take a fleet,

34:42.497 --> 34:45.333
it's only a matter of time
before the jarls learn of your absence

34:45.416 --> 34:46.793
and descend on Kattegat.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.756
Sometimes I think
that is what Canute intended for me.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.258
It may have been.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.345
But I will never let that happen.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.347
I promise.

35:05.061 --> 35:08.397
Canute was wrong
to pass you over for the Norman queen.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.362
You are beautiful.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.785
That kind of talk is dangerous.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.001
It is just between us.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.672
A queen and her dog.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.597
Please.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.073
-Watch the queen.
-Yes, my lord.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.850
They've been slaughtered like cattle.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.108
They silenced him.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.485
I knew there were others.

36:36.569 --> 36:40.031
Put guards at every door.
The gates of the city are to be closed.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.283
No one enters, no one leaves.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.201
My lord.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.915
So much! We are rich!

36:49.582 --> 36:50.666
Where have you been?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.002
I bought half the furs in Novgorod.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.674
Now I need you to find us a boat
to get them to Constantinople.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.930
I killed a man so you could buy furs.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.684
I told you this. The furs
are part of my plan to take back Norway.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.146
-I do not care about your plan.
-Then why did you fight with me?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.649
To save your life, Harald! Nothing more!

37:15.691 --> 37:18.653
Look, maybe you truly are
someday king of Norway,

37:18.736 --> 37:20.863
but no one seems to believe that, but you.

37:21.447 --> 37:25.034
At some point, you need to ask yourself
whether it is truly your destiny

37:25.117 --> 37:26.535
or just a dream.

37:27.203 --> 37:31.082
I understand your doubts,
but I don't share them.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.710
I will sit on the throne of Norway.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.712
I will find a way to get there.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.591
And I'll find my own boat.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.167
You ready?

40:29.969 --> 40:32.471
You are all safe here!

40:35.391 --> 40:39.895
This is our new Uppsala!

40:40.438 --> 40:42.523
-Yes!

42:00.226 --> 42:01.477
Leif Eriksson.

42:06.941 --> 42:07.816
Liv.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.362
I hear you.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.407
Are you really here?

42:16.909 --> 42:17.743
It is me.

42:22.039 --> 42:22.915
Liv?

42:24.166 --> 42:25.376
I miss you.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.129
Yes.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.298
I am here.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.392
I'm lost without you, Liv.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.021
I miss you. I need to talk to you.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.775
Then you must come with me.

44:05.559 --> 44:06.393
Leif.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.525
I can't lose you.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.784
Come to Valhalla.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.500
Yes.

44:44.765 --> 44:45.974
Come with me.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.520
Come.

45:05.828 --> 45:06.662
Leif.

45:19.591 --> 45:20.801
No!
