WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:11.845
You were serving over
the legal limit the other day.

00:12.278 --> 00:13.580
Gin?

00:13.613 --> 00:15.749
And cock-suckin' tonic.
That's what I always say.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.217
You drank it all,
you old goat.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.319
Then I'll have a Gin Smash.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.287
"Smashing."

00:21.321 --> 00:25.258
Hey, Gailer,
you ever had a gin gash?

00:25.291 --> 00:27.660
It's when you drink it out of
down there.

00:27.727 --> 00:28.995
He drinks gin out your gash?

00:29.062 --> 00:31.231
I don't even have to be awake.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.499
Oh, baby, this reminds me

00:32.565 --> 00:34.300
of the time we went down
"McMyrtle" Beach!

00:34.334 --> 00:36.169
- What for?
- Making love.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.571
I'm pretty sure this story's
gonna make you want to squirm.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.273
- Bet I won't.
- Oh, you're gonna squiggle.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.608
Bet I won't!
- Bet in a second,

00:41.641 --> 00:43.176
you're gonna wanna squinch.
- Bet I won't.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.779
Think we ought to take
that bet, baby.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.414
Oh, baby, I love it when you
take it.

00:47.447 --> 00:50.250
I love gettin' taken.
- What's the wager?

00:50.283 --> 00:52.352
If I win, I get a case of beer
from you,

00:52.419 --> 00:54.287
if you win, you buy me
a case of beer.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.321
Deal!

00:55.355 --> 00:56.689
I'll shake on
that cocksucker too.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.191
Shaboink.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.692
So Mrs. McMurray and I are on
our way down to McMyrtle.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.694
He had his first ever gin gash
on the plane ride down,

01:01.761 --> 01:02.762
didn't you, babe.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.130
Mmm. Mighty fine.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.166
Actually, later, we'll tell you
about gash potatoes.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.667
-
- 'Kay.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.336
Mrs. McMurray are at the top of
the McMarriott Hotel Bar.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.871
She's got a little whale tail
sticking out

01:11.938 --> 01:13.306
the top of her pants.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.308
Just a little thong riddin' up,
little t-bar. Heh-heh.

01:15.341 --> 01:19.446
I got the sleeves cut off of my
t

01:19.479 --> 01:21.648
just to let folks know,
we're playing for keeps.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.149
Shoulda packed a lunch.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.951
Oh, no, now this is when
the story starts getting good.

01:24.984 --> 01:26.286
Wait, what was
the wager again?

01:26.319 --> 01:29.022
If Gail wins, she gets a case of
beer from us,

01:29.055 --> 01:31.658
if we win, we buy Gail
a case of beer.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.026
Your money, honey.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.894
So, Mrs. McMurray and
I are setting up shop.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.296
Open sign in the window.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.299
Let's just say this place smells
cologne-ly.

01:39.332 --> 01:40.700
Tell her about the spinner,
baby.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.969
So, this little blonde spinner
sashays up to the bar,

01:43.002 --> 01:45.638
grabs my beer...

01:45.672 --> 01:47.674
polishes off half of it!

01:47.707 --> 01:48.908
What did she look like.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.977
She coulda spat in it
and I'd still fuck her.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.679
Like a six or above then?

01:52.712 --> 01:54.581
Then she looks at me and says,
"Good beer."

01:54.647 --> 01:56.983
I said, "Yeah." Then, she looks
at Mrs. McMurray

01:57.016 --> 01:58.351
and stares her straight
in the tits.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.253
Square in the tits.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.223
Then, she looks back at me and
says,

02:03.256 --> 02:05.425
"Youse guys down for some nose
beers?"

02:05.492 --> 02:06.493
Degen.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.760
I say, "We talkin' the carny
quesos?"

02:07.827 --> 02:09.863
- White goat tocate?
- Talkin' the disco talco.

02:09.896 --> 02:10.897
The Hollywood wash?

02:10.930 --> 02:11.998
She says, "How 'bout a bumpsky?"

02:12.031 --> 02:14.000
I say...
"Bathroom."

02:14.033 --> 02:15.502
For a couple third stall
solditas.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.837
And she says, "No, no, no, no,
big boy!"

02:17.871 --> 02:20.006
She says, "This here's McMyrtle
Beach, and down here,

02:20.039 --> 02:21.341
we don't keep no secrets."

02:21.374 --> 02:23.076
She dumps a Callaway on her hand
and holds it up

02:23.109 --> 02:26.446
to her honker and...

02:26.513 --> 02:27.714
And she dumps a Titleist on my
hand,

02:27.747 --> 02:30.216
I hold it up to my honker...

02:30.250 --> 02:32.118
And she dumps a Slazenger on my
hand,

02:32.185 --> 02:34.721
I hold it up to my honker...

02:34.754 --> 02:35.889
- Whew!
- Dunloped!

02:35.922 --> 02:37.790
Then we're
the Top Flite three.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.527
Says, "How does that smell?"
I says, "Better than hell."

02:40.560 --> 02:42.762
She says, "Yeah, you ever
smelled heaven?"

02:42.795 --> 02:44.531
She sticks her hand down her
skorts, pulls it up

02:44.564 --> 02:46.366
and puts her peter-pointer right
under my beak.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.135
- How'd that smell?
- Like fuzzy peaches.

02:49.202 --> 02:50.937
Eh, I was hoping for Hot Lips.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.441
Gail, is none of this not
gettin' a wee bit butt-off?

02:55.475 --> 02:57.310
- What happens next?
- You mean after she ripped

02:57.377 --> 02:59.045
a dinger off my
McMichael Kors watch?

02:59.078 --> 03:00.747
- I blacked out.
- Huh?

03:00.780 --> 03:02.782
Mrs. McMurray, tell her what
happened.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.752
He drank about 20 gin gash out
the two of us.

03:05.785 --> 03:07.053
You what?

03:07.086 --> 03:08.721
I drank about 20 gin gash out
the two of them.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.791
Oh... How's that go?

03:11.824 --> 03:12.926
So.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.762
I'm stripped down.
- So's the spinner!

03:15.795 --> 03:18.331
Ooh! Yes, Ma'am.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.935
I tip my bird forward, I pour
the ginsky down my tummy,

03:21.968 --> 03:23.636
it filters
through my bird and...

03:23.670 --> 03:26.406
Straight down the gullet!

03:26.439 --> 03:28.942
Gin gash.
Also called ne-groin-ies.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.578
And you blacked out on that?
You've changed, McMurray.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.447
I've seen you drink 30 Gus N'
Brus a baker's dozen times.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.949
I didn't say I was finished.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.451
Nothin' though, Gailer? Is none
of this not getting you...

03:38.484 --> 03:40.520
a wee bit fidgety.
- And then?

03:40.587 --> 03:42.422
And then, I was just gonna
tell ya--

03:42.455 --> 03:43.957
- Then tell me!
- All right by that time

03:43.990 --> 03:47.193
we're about three grams deep on
the cartel crumbs.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.329
Don't forget about the 20
gin gash!

03:49.362 --> 03:51.598
And this gal wants to kick
things up a notch.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.199
- Yep.
- You ever had a gin gimlet?

03:53.266 --> 03:55.802
- Yeah.
- How 'bout a gin rim-let?

03:55.835 --> 03:57.370
How's that go?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.105
I don't have to move!

03:59.138 --> 04:01.874
Just flip around here.
All right so...

04:01.941 --> 04:05.478
Hold on, baby.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.381
Instead of the ginsky going down
my tummy and through my bird,

04:08.448 --> 04:12.719
it goes down my backside and
through my bum.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.054
- 'Member the 20 gin gash?
- Yeah.

04:15.121 --> 04:18.491
Let's just say I lost track of
about a dozen gin rim-lets.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.463
Gailer, ain't none of this
gettin' a wee bit too kinky?

04:23.496 --> 04:24.464
Nah.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.632
Not the fuzzy peach
peter-pointer?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.700
- Nuh-uh.
- Not even the 20 gin gash?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.469
Won't knock it
'til I've tried it.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.472
Not drinking a gin rim-let from
a stranger's butthole

04:32.505 --> 04:34.140
'til her socks are soaked?

04:34.173 --> 04:37.410
What? She left her socks on!
Ugh!

04:37.477 --> 04:40.413
She left her fuckin' socks on?
Fucking disgusting!

04:40.480 --> 04:42.248
Don't leave your socks on.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.351
Never leave your fucking white
socks on! Fuck!

04:45.385 --> 04:48.021
Later on, we'll tell
you about the bum rum.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.757
- We did it, baby.
-

04:53.059 --> 04:55.561
We always do it, baby.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.164
What was the wager again?

04:58.197 --> 05:00.366
If I win, I get a case of beer
from you,

05:00.400 --> 05:03.603
if you win, you buy me
a case of beer.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.552
What's up, Boo?

05:19.585 --> 05:20.687
Tanis, how're ya now?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.422
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.557
Say,
Wouldy

05:24.590 --> 05:26.359
inside the rink cleaning up
after a bunch of hockey guys,

05:26.392 --> 05:28.528
or would you rather end your day
inside the rink

05:28.561 --> 05:29.896
cleaning up after a bunch of
hockey guys?

05:29.929 --> 05:32.031
- Pull the trigger.
- That's what Emma said.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.366
- Who?
- Emma,

05:33.399 --> 05:35.201
the bro-dude chick I'm banging.
- Here we go now.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.736
- You ever drive truck?
- Sure.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.571
Good, because if all else fails
you can always drive truck.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.107
- Fuckin' bing-bang-boom.
- Did you ever drive boni?

05:41.140 --> 05:42.208
Did I ever drive...?

05:42.241 --> 05:44.410
- Zambo.
- Yeah, one more time.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.612
I says did you ever drive
a Zamboni?

05:46.646 --> 05:49.415
- An ice resurfacing machine?
- That's the ticket.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.718
That line does not appear on
my resume.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.887
Well, good news there, pumpkin,
if you can drive a truck,

05:54.921 --> 05:56.122
you can drive boni.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.591
What's that other term you used
there... zambo?

05:58.624 --> 06:00.727
If you can drive a truck,
you can drive Zamboni.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.295
Is that right?

06:02.328 --> 06:03.796
I can do the flooding throughout
the day but I need somebody

06:03.830 --> 06:05.732
to cover the first and last
flood for me.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.433
- Why?
- The bro-dude chick

06:07.467 --> 06:08.935
that I'm banging, she lives in
the city and I can't

06:08.968 --> 06:10.570
be banging her if I'm flooding
the ice until 11 at night.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.804
- No you can't.
- And then,

06:11.838 --> 06:13.740
I can't be banging her again
in the morning

06:13.773 --> 06:16.109
if I'm flooding the ice for
th.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.310
- But it's your job.
- Bro!

06:17.343 --> 06:18.611
Why d'you gotta be such
a fuckin' Boy Scout?

06:18.644 --> 06:20.179
Don't be such a fucking
missionary.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.180
- 'Kay.
- God.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.482
You are such a fucking square.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.417
Well, it's always been my
favourite shape.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.486
My fuckin' eye.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.122
A girl who looks like me tells
you she wants to bang

06:29.155 --> 06:31.657
a girl who looks like her and
all you can say is,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.328
Oh, now you paint
a mental picture.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.096
Oh no, it's just that like,
I've been told

06:37.130 --> 06:39.766
my voice's a wee bit nasally,
so when you said that,

06:39.799 --> 06:42.468
I was kinda like, "Well that
does sound a wee bit like me."

06:44.504 --> 06:47.473
- But it's your job.
- But it's your job...

06:47.507 --> 06:49.275
Yeah, I guess I do kinda nail
it, eh?

06:49.308 --> 06:50.676
It does sound a wee bit like me.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.512
Okay, so I'm gonna get Shania
to do the first flood,

06:52.545 --> 06:53.713
but can you cover me for
the last flood

06:53.780 --> 06:54.981
so I can go mess this chick's
bed up?

06:55.014 --> 06:57.650
When a friend asks for help,
you help 'em.

06:57.683 --> 06:58.885
Thanks, Boo.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.386
Well, it's a good thing I used
to drive truck.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.488
Mm-hm. 'Cause if you can drive a
truck, you can drive boni.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.558
I think I prefer
the term zambo.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.460
Why, 'cause boni sounds
a little bit horny?

07:07.493 --> 07:09.462
- A wee bit.
- You are so fucking ho-hum.

07:09.495 --> 07:10.496
Oh, I've been called worse.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.798
You're like a belt and
suspenders.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.367
Well, reliable and uplifting.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.902
- How's that for ya?
- How's what for me?

07:15.968 --> 07:17.870
- Being a fucking dial tone.
- Oh, it's not too bad for me.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.572
Come inside,
I'll show you the ropes.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.307
You wanna know what, Tanis,
I just can't believe

07:21.340 --> 07:22.308
you've been driving zambo.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.510
What? Don't be so surprised.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.713
You've seen me drive boni.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.984
What the fuck do you mean you
like hockey players now?

07:32.018 --> 07:32.985
Was that unclear?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.520
Let's try
a literal translation.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.222
We like hockey players now.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.826
You like hockey players now?

07:39.859 --> 07:41.527
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.596
- Why?
- Their butts.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.333
- But what about 2cock Chakur?
- Just 2cock.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.434
You plateaued, babe.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.570
We have 20,000 SoundCloud
subscribers.

07:50.603 --> 07:53.406
You had 20,000 SoundCloud
subscribers months ago.

07:53.439 --> 07:54.841
How many you got now?
- 20,000.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.009
- Roald.
- Exactly, no growth.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.012
You missed the boat, boys.
2cock Chakur was hot.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.113
- Just 2cock.
- Roald!

08:01.180 --> 08:02.615
But you didn't capitalize on
the heat.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.218
- SoundCloud is so passé.
- Passé-off, Bianca-donk.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.353
- Where's the Twitter following?
- Twitter is a cult.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.021
Stewart's trying to get
verified.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.191
The Tumblr, the IG,
the Snapchat, the VidVok.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.526
- Vid?
- Vok!

08:13.559 --> 08:14.627
That shit's for kids.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.096
No it isn't.
That shit's entertaining.

08:19.131 --> 08:20.466
Perhaps for enfants.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.869
- Whatever, Roald.
- Whatever, Katy.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.137
- Whatever, Roald.
- Whatever, Katy!

08:25.204 --> 08:26.706
Hah! Last word.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.242
- Whatever, Roald.
- What!

08:29.275 --> 08:32.745
- Must be the butts, boys.
- Gotta be the butts, boys.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.590
You're early.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.626
If you're not ten minutes early,
you're late.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.596
- Look at this mutant, eh?
-

09:23.629 --> 09:25.298
Appears to be overexerting
himself.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.800
- He's going places.
- Literally or figuratively?

09:27.833 --> 09:30.436
Both actually, I got him shipped
up north to my cousin's team,

09:30.469 --> 09:31.804
Senior Triple A, baby.

09:31.837 --> 09:32.939
- Well, that was nice of you.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.640
- I owed him one.
- What for?

09:34.674 --> 09:36.008
He helped me win that 'ship with
the Eagles.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.312
Now, you hold on one bell
pepper. What's his name?

09:39.345 --> 09:41.213
- Shoresy.
- I heard of that dude.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.648
Bit of a snake, isn't he?

09:42.682 --> 09:44.216
Temporary glory is better
than no glory.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.820
- Honesty is the best policy.
- Agh! Fuck you, dude.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.056
Go sell bibles with
that bullshit.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.657
Aren't bibles free?

09:51.691 --> 09:54.160
You are such a pageant bitch
with your conduct.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.661
Well, you know I like to set a
good example

09:55.695 --> 09:56.829
for young people, Tanis.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.197
You're a fucking napkin.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.032
You drive safe then.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.468
Yeah, I gotta go lie on top of
this broad.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.637
- I'll clean up.
- Thanks, Boo.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.140
How late does he go?

10:08.174 --> 10:10.209
'Til he can't anymore.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.479
I like his work ethic.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.181
If by the time
I get to this door

10:15.214 --> 10:18.417
you haven't looked
at my ass once...

10:18.484 --> 10:20.186
you've changed, man.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.188
You've fucking changed.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.357
Fuckin' Samaritan.

10:49.415 --> 10:53.853
You two handed me in the ankle.
Now you answer the bell.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.721
Looks like you answered
to Taco Bell, Frankie,

10:55.755 --> 10:57.023
one too many times.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.624
Why don't you save some for
the rest of us,

10:58.691 --> 11:01.027
you fucking garburator.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.762
Hey, il est Jean-Jaques Fracois
Jaques-Jean.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.698
Eh, more like,
John-Joke Francois Joke-John

11:05.731 --> 11:07.733
fuckin' Jabba the Pizza Hut.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.036
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Frankie.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.937
I told 'em to put a bear trap
over by the dumpster

11:11.971 --> 11:14.206
to keep you from rummaging
around in there.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.708
Go back into the bush and eat
some berries

11:15.741 --> 11:17.910
like you're supposed to.
- Tabarnak!

11:17.943 --> 11:19.745
You're fucking Winnie
the Pooh, bud, go put

11:19.779 --> 11:21.247
some honey in your tummy.
- Câlisse.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.416
Jesus Christ, take Christopher
Robin with you,

11:23.449 --> 11:26.052
you fucking loser.
- Sacrament!

11:26.085 --> 11:27.920
Go back to the fucking dessert
bar, you fucking

11:27.953 --> 11:29.655
Treatzza Pizza face.
- Vidange!

11:29.722 --> 11:32.058
Jesus Christ, Frankie, you've
eaten 20 boxes

11:32.091 --> 11:33.559
of apple fritters since
I saw you last.

11:33.592 --> 11:36.062
Mix in a cinnamon twist,
you fuckin' sumo.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.969
Hey, what's the matter, Frankie?
.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.941
What did you just remember it's
fucking 2-for-1 dip cones

11:48.974 --> 11:51.977
at DQ, you fucking hippo?

11:52.011 --> 11:54.980
Ah, oui, Frankie,
continue comme ca.

11:55.014 --> 11:59.151
Enjoy that 20 pack of 'chickie
nuggles', you fucking loser!

12:08.127 --> 12:10.262
How the fuck do we
get VidVok famous?

12:10.296 --> 12:12.998
- Don't shout at me, skid.
- Please!

12:13.032 --> 12:14.600
Don't shout at her, skid.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.804
I beseech you,
express in words...

12:18.838 --> 12:21.006
what are the kids into
these days?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.109
- Are you funny?
- Unintentionally.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.344
That's what
I go to VidVok for,

12:25.377 --> 12:27.046
a quick, mindless laugh.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.617
We require an alternate
course of action.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.787
Well, I go for the dancing.
Youse know how to dance, so...

12:34.820 --> 12:37.623
do that and you'll be VidVok
famous in a 'minnow'.

12:37.656 --> 12:41.694
We dance for the soul,
not the spectacle!

12:41.727 --> 12:43.529
Well, what are you good at?

12:43.562 --> 12:45.698
-
- Very little.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.700
Geez, it's like
pulling hens' teeth.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.201
- Hens don't have teeth!
- Holy fuck.

12:49.235 --> 12:53.639
If we lack the adequacy to plug
into an existing trend,

12:53.672 --> 12:55.574
then we must forge
our own.

12:55.641 --> 13:00.012
Good luck. VidVok's got nutsacks
doing every damn thing.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.750
Not... every damn thing.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.852
What do you wanna
do, Stewart?

13:06.886 --> 13:11.056
The only thing that
we are truly good at, Roald.

Maybe a little Letterkenny
col?

17:53.038 --> 17:55.441
- Just 2cock.
- Roald, if they're looking

17:55.474 --> 17:57.376
for it on the app it actually
has to be 2cock Chakur.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.178
I know, but if they're just
saying it out loud, I feel-

17:59.211 --> 18:00.846
- 2cock Chakur?
- Just 2cock.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.314
- Banned.
- Yeah, it's a band.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.882
20,000 followers on SoundCloud.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.217
She means you're banned
from VidVok.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.618
- What?
- What?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.220
- You're banned, hon.
What?

18:08.287 --> 18:10.355
"2cock Chakur is banned from
VidVok for violating

18:10.389 --> 18:13.959
"VidVok's policies and rules."
Do anything illegal?

18:13.992 --> 18:15.661
- Snooters.
- Illegal.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.163
Yeah, but they're
recreational snooters.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.466
No matter, Reilly and Jonesy are
blowing up on there.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.968
Reilly and Jonesy... on VidVok!

18:23.001 --> 18:24.570
For what?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.239
Oh, we just went around town and
did that thing with our butts.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.407
Now, remind me again, which
thing--

18:28.474 --> 18:29.641
- Roald.
- You know that thing,

18:29.675 --> 18:32.144
where we yank our shorts up
into our, uh...

18:32.177 --> 18:33.979
Should we just show him?
- Yeah, buddy.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.048
Yeah.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.649
Ready?
- Yeah.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.056
You got famous
for that?

18:44.089 --> 18:45.424
Well yeah.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.759
I mean, there's more to it than
meets the eye, boys.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.262
Yeah. Hired a cinematographer
and a sound engineer,

18:50.329 --> 18:51.497
and we really
got it finessed.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.898
- Oh...
- The cinematographer and

18:52.931 --> 18:55.501
the sound engineer are
technically the same person.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.503
- Skeleton crew, boys.
- Yeah,

18:57.536 --> 18:58.904
he's just by billet brother,

18:58.937 --> 19:01.840
but he went to Humber College,
so he's got it dialled.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.275
- You wanna see?
- Yeah!

19:03.342 --> 19:04.710
- Roald.
- Cool.

for VidVok, but no.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.308
Roald!

20:09.341 --> 20:11.310
We learned there's a butt video
for every season, boys.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.445
It's a super seasonal
concept, boys.

20:13.478 --> 20:17.015
In that it will be over soon.
There's no longevity in this.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.284
We beg to differ. Once they
build up their VidVok audience

20:19.318 --> 20:20.652
to say...
- A milly.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.955
Once they build up their VidVok
audience to a milly,

20:22.988 --> 20:24.456
we'll get 'em going on Cameo.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.468
- He's Jonesy.
- And he's Reilly.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.503
And once we build their audience
across all platforms,

20:38.537 --> 20:40.205
we'll get them going
on OnlyFans.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.340
Huge money on OnlyFans.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.543
House buying money
on OnlyFans.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.479
But please, by all means, keep
hitting the pavement doing

20:47.512 --> 20:50.482
whatever it is you were doing to
get you banned from VidVok.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.351
Buying you those roller blades
first though, buddy.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.453
Ooh! Should we got for a quick
blade right now, buddy?

20:54.486 --> 20:57.689
Good idea. They can do a
video in their roller blades.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.191
Brilliant!

20:59.224 --> 21:01.126
- Stewart?
- Roald.

21:01.159 --> 21:02.527
Not all is lost.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.630
We could still show them
the ones we had banked

21:04.663 --> 21:05.631
for our rollout.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.334
No, no one's impressed,
Roald.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.540
You impressed me.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.144
We did? I mean.

21:19.177 --> 21:22.247
I did?
- Stewart?

21:22.314 --> 21:23.649
- You did.
- Wondrous.

21:23.682 --> 21:27.419
With the stupidest,
most recklessly irresponsible,

21:27.486 --> 21:31.256
gnarly-ass shit you two have
thought of by fuckin' far.

21:31.323 --> 21:32.591
Go on.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.559
We've got enough kids with
problems in this town.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.029
What do you think they'd do if
they saw you guys doing that?

21:37.062 --> 21:39.665
- Follow us.
- Monkey see, monkey do.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.667
-
- Come here.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.035
You come here.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.237
Come... here.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.005
You come--

21:50.542 --> 21:54.079
It's not worth it, Stewart.
Not worth it.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.185
- How're you know?
- Good, and you?

22:00.218 --> 22:01.386
Not so bad.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.789

22:22.474 --> 22:25.277

22:25.310 --> 22:29.047

- Why? You gonna miss him?

22:29.081 --> 22:30.382
