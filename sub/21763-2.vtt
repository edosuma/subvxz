the story of warrior princess

00:50.842 --> 00:53.136
Thighsander Plunderhorse continues

00:53.219 --> 00:57.474
as she rescues her one true love,
Norge Grendelfist.

I'll get you,

01:19.788 --> 01:21.998
if it's the last thing I do.

01:22.082 --> 01:27.712
Oh, no, the last thing you'll do is die,

That doesn't even make sense.
Come on, Clover, think.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.696
What happens next?

01:53.988 --> 01:56.157
I'll get you Lord Chevalier Lorn--

It's water safety week, Mo-Mo.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.565
I'm teaching my peoples
proper lifeboat evacuation protocol.

02:28.648 --> 02:33.444
Uh, okay, but couldn't we demonstrate
proper lifeboat evacuation protocol

02:33.528 --> 02:35.029
with the boat on the ground?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.781
Or, I don't know, in the water?

02:36.865 --> 02:40.451
Ha! In the water? Are you crazy?
Somebody could get hurt.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.414
And why would anyone need a lifeboat
if they're on the ground?

02:44.497 --> 02:48.084

-Hmm?

03:13.776 --> 03:15.653
Barnaby, my sword.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.741
Barnaby, Clover needs her sword.
Wait, who's Barnaby?

03:19.824 --> 03:22.160
Barnaby? I know that name.

I think I'm having heart palpitations.

Also, Clover might need some help too.

you might want a snack.

Hmm.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.355
What do you see, Dr. S?

03:50.438 --> 03:54.275
Wouldn't you like to know? [giggles]

03:55.318 --> 03:58.446
I'll get you,
Lord Chevalier Lorn Von Lorn,

03:58.529 --> 04:01.032
if it's the last thing I do.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.952
You see? She keeps saying nonsense words.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.454
It's not nonsense. It's a name.

04:06.537 --> 04:10.667
Chevalier Lorn Von Lorn is the sworn enemy
of Thighsander Plunderhorse,

04:10.750 --> 04:13.169
warrior princess,
defender of the downtrodden,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.797
and hero of the mythical realm of Gavaria.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.217
From Clover's books. I'm a big fan.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.803
Yes. It's as I suspected.

04:21.886 --> 04:26.766
Clover is suffering from
[screams] acute fictionosis!

04:31.646 --> 04:33.523
A cute what now?

04:33.815 --> 04:39.153
Due to the blow to her head, Clover thinks
she is her own fictional character,

04:39.237 --> 04:43.074
Thighsander Plunderhorse,
living in the world of her books.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.285
Oh! [chuckles]

04:45.368 --> 04:47.078
No, I lied. Still not getting it.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.788
Uh, I think what Dr. S is saying

04:48.871 --> 04:52.417
is that Clover is literally lost
in the world of her imagination.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.130
Ha! Oh, is that all? For a minute there,
I thought it was something serious.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.799
[laughs] That doesn't sound so bad. Whew!

04:59.882 --> 05:03.594
Yeah, I live in my own world too,
and nobody ever gets hurt...

05:03.678 --> 05:05.638
Most of the time.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.017
I assure you, it's very serious.

05:09.100 --> 05:14.063
Since the blow to Clover's head was
so severe and her delusion so complete,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.107
if she were faced with the truth,

05:16.190 --> 05:20.445
the shock to her brain could
[screams] kill her!

05:20.528 --> 05:24.157
Kill her? But there's gotta be
a cure, right?

05:24.240 --> 05:27.535
Well, there are some salves.
Massage is always good.

05:27.618 --> 05:31.039
Or we could [screams] chop off her head!

05:39.422 --> 05:40.506
-As far as we know.
-But--

05:40.590 --> 05:42.258
[shushing]

05:43.051 --> 05:46.637
Hmm. Nope. Chopping off
Clover's head is not going to work.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.183
How could Clover be my head of security
without a head?

05:50.266 --> 05:51.893
You see? Just doesn't make sense.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.895
[exclaims in frustration]

05:53.978 --> 05:57.648
Pack up the saw, Nurse Phantom.
[dejectedly] Maybe next time.

05:57.732 --> 06:02.195
Told you we wouldn't need it. But, no,
you made me lug it all the way here.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.112
For nothing.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.322
[hisses]

06:04.405 --> 06:07.200
Wait. Where are you going?
What about Clover?

06:07.283 --> 06:08.951
Isn't there anything else we can do?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.455
Please, Dr. S, we have to save her!

06:12.538 --> 06:14.874
Wow, Mort. I didn't realize
you liked Clover that much.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.626
Yeah, we hang out all the time.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.044
[Clover] Hey, Mort. Where's Maurice?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.045
I don't know.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.505
-Hey, Mort, you seen Ted?
-No.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.715
-Hey, Mort. Know where Masikura is?
-Nope.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.343
Yeah, we're pretty much best friends.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.804
Which is why we've gotta save her!

06:28.221 --> 06:30.181
The only other way to save Clover

06:30.264 --> 06:33.059
is for everyone to play along
with her fantasy

06:33.142 --> 06:34.977
and wait for her brain to heal

06:35.061 --> 06:38.439
and the memories
of who she really is to be restored.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.983
You mean, the whole kingdom
has to pretend to be

06:41.067 --> 06:43.027
the characters from Clover's stories?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.822
Is that what I said?
'Cause that sounds pretty good.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.490
Ooh, will there be costumes?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.076
Of course not, Ted.
We don't have the budget for that.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.369
Will there be costumes?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.204
-Mm-mmm.
-Aw.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.040
Snap! Okay, everybody,
you heard the creepy snake doctor.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.417
Operation Save Clover's Brain is a go.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.129
I must warn you...

07:01.212 --> 07:02.088
Hmm?

07:02.171 --> 07:07.135
You must not break character
or Clover's brain could explode.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.845
[gasps] Esplode?

07:08.928 --> 07:12.890
Relax, Mort.
I'm sure Dr. S is exaggerating.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.851
[laughing] Oh, no.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.354
Brain explosions are very common
with this type of illness.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.233
You'd be surprised
how many heads detonate around here.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.735
Nurse Phantom, demonstration please.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.196
It'll go something like this. Gah!

07:27.280 --> 07:28.114
And then...

07:28.197 --> 07:29.824
[screaming]

07:29.907 --> 07:30.741
And then...

07:30.825 --> 07:32.034
[choking]

07:36.247 --> 07:40.793
All right, everyone, you should all now
have cards with your new names on them.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.380
Ooh. Hey, everybody, I'm the bad guy!

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
[laughs maliciously]

07:46.549 --> 07:50.678
For example, Sage here
will be playing Norge Grendelfist,

07:50.761 --> 07:54.474
enchanted prince
and prisoner of Lord Chevalier.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.600
Jealous!

07:55.683 --> 07:58.686
Jealousy is a pill
on the sweater of friendship.

08:01.355 --> 08:06.152
Okay. And I will be playing
Chetwin the Wandering Troubadour.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.029
Better warm up the old pipes.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.280
[clears throat] Oh, la, la--

08:09.363 --> 08:10.990
Barnaby, the squirrel?

08:11.073 --> 08:12.533
[laughs]

08:12.617 --> 08:14.285
There must be some mistake, you know.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.579
'Cause I don't even know
what a squirrel is.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.331
Is there a king? Prince?

08:18.414 --> 08:21.792
Some sort of magician
or something else in there?

08:21.876 --> 08:24.128
It's pronounced "squire," Your Majesty.

08:24.212 --> 08:28.841
It may be pronounced like that,
but it sounds like "lame"!

08:29.425 --> 08:33.137
I'm sorry, King Julien, but Clover...
I mean Thighsander...

08:33.221 --> 08:36.182
called you Barnaby
and we can't break the illusion.

08:36.265 --> 08:40.645
Plus, you look just like him.
See? Squire Barnaby.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.941
Thighsander's sword-carrying sidekick.
Skilled at dancing, but not much else.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.569
Known for being dramatic,
lazy, and often selfish.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.864
Sidekick? Oh, no! That's...

08:51.948 --> 08:54.575
No! Look at me. Look at this face.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.286
This is not the face of a sidekick.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.456
I am a leading man.
How could Clover do this to me?

09:00.540 --> 09:04.585
Being a sidekick isn't so bad. Besides,
it doesn't matter what part you have.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.754
We're doing this to help Clover, remember?

09:06.837 --> 09:07.672
Sir Reginald.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.467
Uh, yes, that's me. Sir Reginald,
brave and loyal knight.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.970
How can I be of service, Thighsander?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.513
Gather my men at once.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.684
Maurice gets to be a knight?
[screams] Just... [screams]

09:20.268 --> 09:21.769
Barnaby, give your seat to Sir Reginald.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.187
Ah!

09:23.563 --> 09:24.480
Seriously?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.941
You will stand. Now, Squire!

09:30.152 --> 09:30.987
Tch.

09:32.697 --> 09:37.243
It is up to us to rescue Norge and stop
Chevalier from seizing control of Gavaria.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.329
In order to do this,
we must first embark on a quest

09:40.413 --> 09:43.207
to retrieve the items
that will enable us to defeat Phlog,

09:43.291 --> 09:48.796
the two-headed dragon guarding Norge,
and ensure our victory against Chevalier.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.423
-[Julien] Uh.
-Yes, Barnaby?

09:50.506 --> 09:51.507
Hmm, yeah.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.303
Can't we just skip all that quest stuff
and go straight to the rescuing Norge?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.680
Just sayin'. Might save some time.

09:57.763 --> 10:02.476
Barnaby, please don't make me
discipline you with my elven poker again!

10:03.185 --> 10:07.148
Trust me, you don't want the poker.
I read about it in her books.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.276
That elven tool
gave me nightmares for days.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.156
Good. We leave at once.
First stop, the Wizard.

Uh, yeah. Check out my sweet wand.

10:57.281 --> 11:00.868
We don't have time for your feeble-minded
buffoonery, Squire Barnaby.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.869
Where is the wizard?

11:01.952 --> 11:04.955
Over... [slurping] here.

11:05.206 --> 11:10.044
[chuckles] I am sorry, friend.
Forgive my foolish squire.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.756
We have come for your invisibility potion.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.425
My... precious?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.804
Uh, yeah. Yes. Wait, what?
[chuckles] You call it your "precious"?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.597
That's kind of... that's weird.

11:21.680 --> 11:26.227
This potion will help us
in our quest to defeat Chevalier.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.354
No. No!

11:28.437 --> 11:29.897
[Maurice coughing]

11:29.980 --> 11:35.277
Perhaps the wizard is forgetting that
we need this potion to save our friend?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.280
Oh, all right.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.159
Wait for it.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.372
Thank you, powerful wizard.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.958
Your generosity
will not be soon forgotten.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.211
This is the bit where you...
If you could just... I'm gonna...

11:52.294 --> 11:55.047

11:56.257 --> 11:57.466
We have the potion!

11:57.550 --> 12:02.138
Now, it's on to the Den of Certain Death
to retrieve a manticore tooth.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.431
Certain death?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.723
What's a manticore?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.309
[snoring]

12:08.269 --> 12:09.103
[all gasp]

12:09.186 --> 12:11.272
[gulps] Thighsander, what are you doing?

12:11.355 --> 12:12.440
Are you out of your mind?

12:12.523 --> 12:13.983
Technically, she is.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.487
Oh. There's no need to be afraid.
They can't catch me...

Don't look at me. You're the knight.
I'm just a squirrel, man.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.907
Ted, you've read all of Clover's books.
Do something!

13:02.990 --> 13:06.577
My character's just an itinerant
singer/songwriter. What can I do?

13:07.161 --> 13:09.622
Uh, Sir Reginald,

13:12.416 --> 13:14.627
