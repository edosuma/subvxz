WEBVTT

00:37.587 --> 00:39.257
I know smoking this
blunt is the last thing

00:39.289 --> 00:40.892
I need right now,

00:40.925 --> 00:43.360
especially after what
happened yesterday.

00:49.533 --> 00:50.333
Shit.

00:51.102 --> 00:52.669
Every inch of my body feel like

00:52.702 --> 00:54.806
I got ran over by a fuckin'
truck.

00:58.075 --> 00:59.911
I'm so lucky to be
alive right now.

01:02.046 --> 01:04.748
But instead of praising
God for still breathing,

01:05.850 --> 01:08.518
the only thing on my
mind is the hatred

01:08.552 --> 01:11.388
and rage that's burning
through my heart right now.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.062
Truth be told, none of
this would have happened

01:18.095 --> 01:20.363
had I not left
myself vulnerable.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.803
But I love to fuck,

01:26.804 --> 01:29.539
like a drug addict fiendin'
for the high.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.180
If it gets me off, I'm down

01:36.214 --> 01:39.649
for whatever with whomever.

01:41.451 --> 01:42.719
I was betrayed by
people who I thought

01:42.753 --> 01:44.856
I could trust to have my back.

01:47.591 --> 01:51.528
Man, hindsight is 20/20,
ain't it?

01:51.561 --> 01:53.463
Note to self Chole Addison,

01:55.066 --> 01:58.202
never let your guard down again.

02:15.086 --> 02:16.020
Dear diary.

02:18.890 --> 02:23.127
My name is Chloe Addison

02:25.296 --> 02:30.500
and I am 13 years old.

02:33.938 --> 02:38.742
I live in Dallas, Texas

02:39.343 --> 02:44.547
with my mother, Queen.

02:58.996 --> 03:00.563
We're still going to
the movies this weekend,

03:00.597 --> 03:01.665
aren't we, Daddy?

03:02.833 --> 03:04.135
Of course we are, sweetheart.

03:04.168 --> 03:06.203
I told you that, didn't I?

03:06.237 --> 03:07.704
You've made promises before

03:07.737 --> 03:09.539
and something always comes up.

03:10.707 --> 03:12.509
Welp, looks like we're here.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.612
Come on, Daddy, do I
really have to go?

03:15.645 --> 03:17.915
I'd rather spend the
day with you.

03:17.949 --> 03:19.283
Aw.

03:19.317 --> 03:21.584
Sweetheart, we talked
about this before.

03:22.353 --> 03:23.854
Now Daddy got errands to run

03:24.721 --> 03:25.790
and business to handle.

03:26.824 --> 03:29.559
But I promise when I
pick you up this evening,

03:29.592 --> 03:30.928
we can go to the mall.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.163
For real?

03:32.196 --> 03:33.898
For real, sweetheart.

03:33.931 --> 03:35.299
Can I get that
new Coach purse

03:35.333 --> 03:36.968
I've been wantin'?

03:37.001 --> 03:39.236
Of course you can,
baby.

03:39.270 --> 03:40.503
- Daddy, you the best.
- I know that.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.106
And I won't tell Mama
you been talking to Miss-

03:42.139 --> 03:43.341
- Hey, hey.

03:43.374 --> 03:45.209
Keep that on the low.

03:45.242 --> 03:46.143
That's us.

03:51.382 --> 03:53.217
Give 'em hell, baby, okay?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.085
Do it the Addison way.

03:54.118 --> 03:54.819
All right.

03:54.852 --> 03:56.787
Give it here, pow, Addisons.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.222
Good morning, Mr. Addison

03:58.255 --> 03:59.290
and good morning, Chloe.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.292
You look so pretty today
in your dress.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.659
Thank you.

04:02.692 --> 04:03.961
Now you should be
very proud of your daughter.

04:03.995 --> 04:05.363
Oh, I am.

04:05.396 --> 04:07.832
She is by far the
most gift reader in the group.

04:07.865 --> 04:08.933
So, Chloe, I have a
book for you.

04:08.966 --> 04:11.534
It's my favorite, you're
gonna love it.

04:11.568 --> 04:12.370
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:12.403 --> 04:14.305
I can't wait to read it.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.806
Daddy, I think I see Rihanna.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.573
Ooh.

04:16.606 --> 04:18.009
Hey, Ri.

04:18.042 --> 04:19.877
Love you, too, baby.

04:19.910 --> 04:20.744
Bye, Daddy.

04:21.912 --> 04:22.545
Hey.

04:22.579 --> 04:23.814
What's going on with you?

04:23.848 --> 04:26.516
I'm so happy to see
you, I missed you so much.

04:26.549 --> 04:28.352
Oh, my gosh, I missed you,
too.

04:28.386 --> 04:29.420
Are you feeling better?

04:29.453 --> 04:30.421
Ah, much better.

04:30.454 --> 04:32.456
I'm so glad to be back.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.426
Staying at my grandma's
house was so boring.

04:35.459 --> 04:36.827
I thought you liked
it over there?

04:36.861 --> 04:39.397
Sometimes, but she's
not as much fun

04:39.430 --> 04:40.630
as your grandmother.

04:40.663 --> 04:41.999
And she can't cook, so.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.367
I heard that.

04:43.401 --> 04:47.204
Uh, why is Miss Nina is
feeling on your dad like that?

04:47.238 --> 04:48.406
I don't know.

04:48.439 --> 04:50.941
She acts like that every
time she's around him.

04:52.343 --> 04:54.445
Doesn't she know he's married?

04:54.478 --> 04:57.381
Yeah, but she don't
know my mama's crazy.

04:57.415 --> 04:58.315
Obviously.

04:58.349 --> 04:59.649
I seen Queen cuss women out

04:59.682 --> 05:00.617
and beat a few of them up

05:00.650 --> 05:02.453
for looking at my
daddy like that.

05:02.486 --> 05:04.822
Yep.

05:04.855 --> 05:06.689
Rihanna, come on, are you
still gonna sit with us?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.359
Yes, here we come.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.027
Fuck we, no thanks.

05:10.061 --> 05:11.996
I don't wanna sit with
the lower class.

05:20.670 --> 05:23.808
Chloe, what you said
earlier about lower class

05:23.841 --> 05:26.709
and Kelly, that was rude.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.779
Whatever.
I was just being honest.

05:28.813 --> 05:31.282
Mm-hmm, I was just
being honest.

05:31.315 --> 05:32.783
Yeah, okay.

05:32.817 --> 05:36.754
Well, you know, your
boyfriend Cedric is in here.

05:36.787 --> 05:39.156
Cedric Henderson is
not my boyfriend.

05:39.190 --> 05:41.292
Mm-hmm, then why do you
talk about him

05:41.325 --> 05:43.260
like all the time then, huh?

05:43.294 --> 05:44.895
Cedric is just eye candy.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.831
You wanna know the
real reason why

05:46.864 --> 05:48.766
I called Kelly lower class?

05:48.799 --> 05:50.568
It's because she's been
treating me differently lately

05:50.600 --> 05:52.236
since you've been gone.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.372
Why, did you do something
to make her mad at you?

05:55.406 --> 05:56.807
No, she's just been
acting weird

05:56.841 --> 05:58.741
and treating me
different lately.

06:00.578 --> 06:01.744
I think I might know why,

06:01.779 --> 06:04.281
but you have to promise
not to tell anyone

06:04.315 --> 06:05.648
what I'm about to tell you.

06:05.682 --> 06:09.086
Not Miss Nina or your mama,
nobody Chloe.

06:10.687 --> 06:12.890
Rihanna, I won't,
just tell me.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.594
Before I got sick,
Kelly told me

06:16.626 --> 06:18.295
that she hates where she lives.

06:18.329 --> 06:19.497
Her house is always dirty

06:19.530 --> 06:21.465
and she always sees
roaches crawling

06:21.499 --> 06:22.867
all over the place all the time.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.069
Ew, gross, that's disgusting.

06:25.102 --> 06:26.669
And most of the time
she just goes

06:26.703 --> 06:28.305
to bed hungry because, I mean,

06:28.339 --> 06:31.542
her mom can't afford to
buy then a lot of food.

06:31.575 --> 06:32.776
Dang, that's why
she's been eating

06:32.810 --> 06:34.578
the way she has lately.

06:34.612 --> 06:36.746
She's been sneaking extra
snacks and sandwiches

06:36.780 --> 06:37.915
in her backpack, too.

06:37.948 --> 06:39.216
Mm-hmm, haven't you
ever noticed

06:39.250 --> 06:42.086
how dirty she looks and
how she dresses sometimes?

06:42.119 --> 06:42.887
Yeah, every day.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.221
Well, that's because,
you know.

06:44.255 --> 06:44.687
Hey, Chloe.

06:45.923 --> 06:49.393
Tell Q'Wan I said what's up
and I'm gonna see him later.

06:49.426 --> 06:51.061
Okay, I will.

06:51.095 --> 06:51.728
Hi, Cedric.

06:51.762 --> 06:53.197
What's up, Rihanna?

06:54.098 --> 06:55.065
Y'all be easy.

06:55.099 --> 06:56.033
You, too.

06:56.066 --> 06:56.934
Later.

06:58.435 --> 06:59.702
He's gonna be my man.

06:59.736 --> 07:02.072
Girl, I thought you just said.

07:02.106 --> 07:02.973
I know.

07:03.607 --> 07:04.608
Okay.

07:04.642 --> 07:07.677
Well, he is fine, but, ugh,
gross,

07:07.710 --> 07:08.812
he's your brother's friend,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.247
so he's like family.

07:10.281 --> 07:12.283
Guess we 'bout to be
kissin' cousins, then.

07:12.316 --> 07:13.117
Girl, you nasty.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.818
Rihanna and Chloe,
come on.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.187
Come work out with us.

07:21.825 --> 07:23.227
My mama is a real boss

07:23.260 --> 07:26.330
and her friend Pizazz watches
her back all the time.

07:27.464 --> 07:30.134
I think they do crime
stuff together.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.335
Queen.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.403
Pizazz.

07:32.436 --> 07:34.872
I thought I saw your
car parked out front.

07:35.973 --> 07:38.876
Culture Nail Bar, this
place is nice.

07:38.909 --> 07:40.945
What did you expect
for the Queen?

07:43.847 --> 07:46.517
Hey, Cedric, how you doin',
sweetie?

07:46.550 --> 07:47.818
I'm good Miss Queen.

07:50.487 --> 07:52.356
So, do you have a girlfriend?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.824
Really, Queen?

07:53.857 --> 07:56.227
Hey, I'm just trying
to get to know the boy.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.127
Well, do you?

07:58.495 --> 07:59.463
I'm just datin' right now.

07:59.496 --> 08:01.565
I ain't takin' nothin' serious.

08:01.599 --> 08:03.300
Well, good.

08:03.334 --> 08:04.969
So you had any pussy yet?

08:08.439 --> 08:10.341
I take that as a no.

08:11.642 --> 08:13.143
It's good, stay woke.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.745
Little ratchet ass
girls don't care nothing

08:15.779 --> 08:17.982
about a man's
character these days.

08:18.015 --> 08:20.884
All they care about is
your dollars and your dick.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.320
Why you gotta antagonize
the kid, Queen?

08:23.354 --> 08:24.788
So you know how I do it.

08:26.890 --> 08:30.661
So, you get confirmation?

08:30.694 --> 08:33.397
Yeah, about an hour ago.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.064
Okay.

08:34.098 --> 08:36.166
Yellow shirt, white jeans.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.436
Hmm, what's her name?

08:40.704 --> 08:41.772
Ava.

08:42.906 --> 08:44.608
What kind of
whip is she driving?

08:44.642 --> 08:46.310
It's a silver BMW convertible.

08:46.343 --> 08:47.411
It's parked out back.

08:49.079 --> 08:50.514
Mm-hmm.

08:50.547 --> 08:52.516
So, Ced, are you sure
you're ready

08:52.549 --> 08:53.984
to join the royal court?

08:54.685 --> 08:56.920
For sure, I'm with it.

08:57.921 --> 09:00.357
Well, see how well
you can guard the Queen.

09:01.558 --> 09:02.793
A little incentive.

09:04.662 --> 09:05.562
Peace.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.401
Oklahoma, move it.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.209
Hey, girl.

09:19.243 --> 09:19.877
Hey.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.612
I thought that was you.

09:21.645 --> 09:22.513
Ava, right?

09:23.547 --> 09:25.149
I'm sorry, have we met before?

09:25.182 --> 09:27.518
No, but by the time I'm
done with you,

09:27.551 --> 09:29.353
you'll wish we hadn't.

09:29.386 --> 09:30.254
Get her.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.495
You crazy bitch.

09:38.529 --> 09:41.298
I think you got me
mistaken for somebody else.

09:41.332 --> 09:42.533
No, no, no, no.

09:42.566 --> 09:45.035
You're the skank that's
fuckin' Elijah Parker.

09:45.636 --> 09:46.704
See, I had no problem

09:46.737 --> 09:48.205
with him sellin' his shit
down in Houston,

09:48.238 --> 09:51.108
but when he decided to
grow a pair of balls

09:51.141 --> 09:52.676
and move up on my territory,

09:52.710 --> 09:53.844
that's some disrespectful shit

09:53.877 --> 09:56.246
and that got to be dealt with.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.348
What did you do?

09:57.381 --> 09:58.649
Did you hurt him?

09:58.682 --> 10:03.053
Did you know this
motherfucker had the audacity

10:03.087 --> 10:04.455
to tell this crew to come up

10:04.488 --> 10:05.522
and shoot up my carwash,

10:05.556 --> 10:07.224
the one that I owned last week.

10:07.257 --> 10:09.159
I don't know nothin'
about any of that shit.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.461
You don't now nothin'
about this shit?

10:10.494 --> 10:11.295
No, I don't.

10:12.563 --> 10:15.099
Damn, too bad Elijah
didn't live long enough

10:15.132 --> 10:17.201
to regret it, though.

10:17.234 --> 10:18.202
My God.

10:18.235 --> 10:19.603
Mm-hmm.

10:19.636 --> 10:21.305
Did you kill him?

10:23.006 --> 10:26.076
I mean, if Eli did what
you think he did,

10:26.110 --> 10:29.179
then you already have the
one who's responsible.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.048
Why the fuck did you
come for me?

10:31.081 --> 10:33.951
Because their blood is
on your hands, too, bitch.

10:35.252 --> 10:37.988
You helped set them
motherfuckers up.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.224
And if you deny that shit,

10:40.257 --> 10:41.625
I promise I'll blow
your shit up.

10:41.658 --> 10:43.160
Okay, okay.

10:44.796 --> 10:46.765
He threatened to kill my
four-year-old son

10:46.798 --> 10:48.499
if I didn't agree to help him.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.267
I swear.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.273
Man, shoot that bitch.

10:56.306 --> 11:00.043
No, sir, no, please,
please, please tell me,

11:00.077 --> 11:03.414
just tell me what I can
do to make this right.

11:03.447 --> 11:05.182
Give me your keys.

11:06.183 --> 11:07.584
Give me your motherfuckin' keys.

11:15.894 --> 11:17.862
I want you to take
Elijah's body,

11:17.896 --> 11:19.430
put it in this bitch's trunk.

11:19.463 --> 11:20.230
Oh, my goodness.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.900
Drop it down the
Delvon Salvage

11:21.932 --> 11:23.200
and crush the motherfucker's
body on the inside.

11:25.135 --> 11:27.204
What do we do with this bitch?

11:27.237 --> 11:30.507
I'm begging you please,
please, please don't kill me.

11:30.541 --> 11:31.708
You wasn't doin'
all that shit

11:31.742 --> 11:32.844
when you was settin' folks up.

11:32.877 --> 11:35.446
We know that your son needs you.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.820
I want you to take
Pinky and slice her face

11:41.853 --> 11:44.521
and throw her in the
trash like she is.

11:44.555 --> 11:47.090
Oh, bum bitch.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.193
I'm gonna love this.

11:50.762 --> 11:51.796
No, don't do it.

12:10.013 --> 12:11.648
Oklahoma, bring me my shoes.

12:18.222 --> 12:19.089
Mel.

12:22.192 --> 12:23.393
What's up, Queen?

12:23.427 --> 12:25.028
Your client had a
family emergency,

12:25.062 --> 12:26.530
had to leave out back.

12:26.563 --> 12:27.564
Really?

12:27.598 --> 12:29.066
I just did her toes
and her nails

12:29.099 --> 12:30.567
and she did not pay me.

12:36.707 --> 12:38.342
I'm sure this will be enough.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.214
You need a Brazilian
wax, an eyebrow wax?

12:44.248 --> 12:46.183
That's what I thought.

12:46.216 --> 12:48.118
No, I'm good, Mel, thank you.

12:49.888 --> 12:50.889
Be safe, girl.

12:50.922 --> 12:52.322
Will do.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.490
Oklahoma.

13:07.271 --> 13:08.773
Are you still pissed

13:08.806 --> 13:12.142
that Chloe's not going to
Zoe's place for the weekend?

13:15.178 --> 13:17.748
Her ass bailing out on
me, D.A., was bullshit

13:17.782 --> 13:19.149
and you know it.

13:19.182 --> 13:21.920
Expecting her to miss
her sister's bridal shower,

13:21.953 --> 13:23.687
that's ridiculous, Queen.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.322
She's the maid of honor, baby.

13:25.355 --> 13:27.324
But I agreed to pay
that bitch $500.

13:28.392 --> 13:31.461
And, blood is always
thicker than water, baby.

13:31.495 --> 13:33.430
Blood is
thicker than my ass.

13:33.463 --> 13:34.731
You know what?

13:36.700 --> 13:37.902
I can't believe that bitch.

13:37.936 --> 13:39.403
I'm a fuck her up.

13:39.436 --> 13:41.171
Girl, put this shit in your
mouth and chill the fuck out.

13:41.204 --> 13:42.807
I don't want that shit, D.A.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.146
You sure that's the only thing

13:49.179 --> 13:51.515
that you want in my mouth?

13:54.117 --> 13:55.652
Our guests will be
here shortly,

13:55.686 --> 13:56.687
so don't tempt me.

13:57.454 --> 13:58.923
Besides, Chloe can just stay

13:58.957 --> 14:00.758
in her room all night.

14:00.792 --> 14:01.993
I mean, it'll be simple for her

14:02.026 --> 14:03.193
because all she'll do is have

14:03.226 --> 14:05.228
that phone stuck to her face

14:05.262 --> 14:06.630
like a damn zombie.

14:07.397 --> 14:08.833
But I think you just said

14:08.866 --> 14:11.435
that we still got time
for you to be in my mouth.

14:14.471 --> 14:14.839
Woman.

14:16.074 --> 14:19.176
Let's get out here and
get down to business.

14:19.209 --> 14:21.244
We got all night for that.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.346
Yeah.

14:25.016 --> 14:27.384
You go ahead, I'll be down.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.854
With your fine ass.

14:31.321 --> 14:32.757
My mama and daddy have a lot

14:32.790 --> 14:34.524
of parties at our house.

14:34.558 --> 14:37.361
And then the ladies give
my mama money.

14:40.397 --> 14:42.900
The Queen has arrived.

14:42.934 --> 14:43.901
Yes, she has.

14:44.836 --> 14:46.637
And thanks to our girl, Venus,

14:46.670 --> 14:48.072
you all will be partying

14:48.106 --> 14:50.440
with some very elite
pockets tonight.

14:50.474 --> 14:53.811
I'm talking about investors,
engineers, surgeons,

14:53.845 --> 14:55.512
those who come from wealth.

14:55.545 --> 14:57.782
And regardless of
their pedigree,

14:58.883 --> 15:01.351
when their horny asses
come up in here,

15:01.385 --> 15:04.756
their stature means nothing
between these four walls.

15:04.789 --> 15:05.890
Absolutely.

15:05.923 --> 15:07.424
They all pay to play.

15:08.458 --> 15:12.096
In cash, up front,
no exceptions.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.730
I don't care if the
want the real deal

15:13.765 --> 15:14.631
or the strap on.

15:14.665 --> 15:15.332
I don't give a fuck

15:15.365 --> 15:17.234
who's about giving or receiving.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.604
Anal costs more, understood?

15:21.839 --> 15:26.209
I expect to see a freaky,
triple X rated show tonight.

15:27.244 --> 15:29.781
Give them something
they don't get at home.

15:31.748 --> 15:32.749
And just don't want

15:32.784 --> 15:34.752
their body parts to
be blown away.

15:34.786 --> 15:35.987
I want their fuckin' minds

15:36.020 --> 15:37.955
to be blown away.

15:37.989 --> 15:40.091
So whatever you guys need,

15:40.124 --> 15:42.359
D.A. has all that shit on sale.

15:42.392 --> 15:44.896
He has the cush, the pills,

15:44.929 --> 15:46.864
the lines to blow.

15:46.898 --> 15:48.198
And the more money they spend.

15:48.231 --> 15:49.733
Mm-hmm.

15:49.767 --> 15:50.667
The bigger your cut.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.838
Unless you motherfuckers
got a death wish,

15:55.139 --> 15:58.208
don't even think about
negotiating no side deals.

15:59.342 --> 16:00.744
Are we clear?

16:00.778 --> 16:03.181
Queen and I have
always protected you

16:03.213 --> 16:06.084
and paid you extremely well.

16:06.117 --> 16:08.753
Never, never take
that for granted

16:09.553 --> 16:11.354
by messing with our paper.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.490
'Cause it's gonna be
a very profitable night.

16:13.523 --> 16:14.391
Mm.

16:16.828 --> 16:18.062
One love.

16:18.096 --> 16:20.164
It's show time.

17:05.943 --> 17:06.811
Mm.

17:17.121 --> 17:17.989
Hmm.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.634
I need to talk with you

17:30.667 --> 17:33.670
and bring the skank with you.

18:01.464 --> 18:02.834
So anybody wanna tell me why

18:02.867 --> 18:06.170
the fuck you all are flirtin'
with each other all night?

18:06.204 --> 18:07.470
What?

18:07.504 --> 18:09.140
Man, that shit you been smokin'

18:09.173 --> 18:10.775
got your head fucked up.

18:12.109 --> 18:13.144
Now, look.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.578
I don't know what you
thought you saw,

18:14.611 --> 18:18.115
but you know that's a line
that I would never cross.

18:18.149 --> 18:19.649
A room full of rich
men downstairs

18:19.683 --> 18:22.385
and you have the nerve to
be crushin' on my dude?

18:22.419 --> 18:24.021
Okay, Queen, it
was all an act.

18:24.055 --> 18:24.322
All an act?

18:24.354 --> 18:25.555
Yes.

18:25.589 --> 18:27.992
But your body language
said something different.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.060
So you know what?

18:29.093 --> 18:30.928
You think D.A.'s sexy,
don't you?

18:33.630 --> 18:34.932
I'm a let you have him.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.802
Suck his dick.

18:37.835 --> 18:38.870
Hell, no.

18:40.071 --> 18:41.105
I said, suck his dick.

18:41.138 --> 18:41.973
You know what?

18:42.006 --> 18:42.840
Yo ass is trippin'.

18:44.208 --> 18:44.976
Am I?

18:45.009 --> 18:45.709
Suck his dick.

18:45.742 --> 18:48.445
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

18:52.316 --> 18:54.085
He better not feel no teeth.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.323
Tonight, Cedric was
at our house

18:59.357 --> 19:00.958
and I tried to do to him

19:00.992 --> 19:02.392
like I see the ladies do.

19:04.095 --> 19:04.962
The fuck?

19:04.996 --> 19:06.496
Holy girl, what are you doin'?

19:06.529 --> 19:09.133
I come here to see if
you needed help with that.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.568
Damn.

19:12.937 --> 19:14.005
You're big.

19:14.038 --> 19:15.239
I wanna lick it.

19:15.273 --> 19:16.941
Girl, if you don't get
your fast ass outta here,

19:16.974 --> 19:18.175
I will tell your mother.

19:18.209 --> 19:19.310
I just want-

19:19.343 --> 19:20.311
- Now.

19:20.344 --> 19:21.611
Come on, man.

19:22.346 --> 19:23.814
Hey, let me see.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.787
Get your ass outta here.

19:30.788 --> 19:32.857
Damn girl gonna get me killed.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.533
Get your ass over here.

19:45.702 --> 19:49.173
Come on, please, don't
make me do this.

20:09.226 --> 20:10.394
Man, that was intense.

20:17.534 --> 20:19.536
Girl, you are good.

20:22.807 --> 20:23.374
Baby.

20:23.407 --> 20:24.308
Mm?

20:24.342 --> 20:28.678
She need to come work for us.

20:28.712 --> 20:31.282
You need to come work for me.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.749
You can make more
money in one week

20:32.783 --> 20:34.085
than you can make in
a whole month.

20:34.118 --> 20:35.319
You know what?

20:35.353 --> 20:38.189
Just 'cause you disrespected me,

20:38.222 --> 20:39.757
I ain't one of your hos.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.326
So, fuck you and your job.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.194
I got a job.

20:43.227 --> 20:44.527
No, fuck you.

20:44.561 --> 20:46.831
Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it.

20:46.864 --> 20:47.832
I'll do it.

20:47.865 --> 20:50.468
No, no, no,
keep that same energy.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.969
- Queen, come on.
- Pizazz!

20:52.003 --> 20:53.570
You know I have a daughter,
okay.

20:53.603 --> 20:54.571
Queen, please don't do this.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.740
Take this trash out.

20:56.774 --> 20:59.043
Please, please, don't
do this to me, come on.

20:59.076 --> 21:02.113
And one day, I'm gonna
be just like Queen.

21:02.146 --> 21:03.680
I'm gonna be a boss.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.428
Damn it.

21:17.461 --> 21:20.131
Does he have to be so punctual?

21:30.441 --> 21:31.275
Shit.

21:32.276 --> 21:33.110
Fuck.

21:33.144 --> 21:34.078
I'm comin'.

21:41.085 --> 21:41.718
Damn.

21:41.752 --> 21:42.853
This room ain't that big

21:42.887 --> 21:44.221
for you to be taking that long,

21:44.255 --> 21:46.223
like what were you do-

21:46.257 --> 21:47.324
let me guess.

21:48.459 --> 21:49.527
You got your stuff?

21:49.559 --> 21:50.761
Of course.

21:52.695 --> 21:53.563
Hey, Chloe.

21:53.596 --> 21:54.799
Here you go.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.602
Ooh, yes.

21:59.636 --> 22:00.838
I told y'all the sports banquet

22:00.871 --> 22:03.007
would be an ideal
huntin' ground, didn't I?

22:03.908 --> 22:06.544
As usual, you were right,
but that?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.779
Ain't just from the athletes.

22:08.813 --> 22:10.147
Y'all slept with the coaches?

22:10.181 --> 22:13.583
Girl, scouts, professors
and boosters, too, I think.

22:15.119 --> 22:16.954
Hey Q'Wan.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.557
You're looking sexy as usual.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.657
As are you.

22:21.724 --> 22:22.793
Don't take it personal,
big bro,

22:22.827 --> 22:24.428
but if you want some of that,

22:24.462 --> 22:26.330
you got to pay like
everybody else.

22:26.363 --> 22:27.331
Come on, little sis,

22:27.364 --> 22:28.799
you gonna do me like that?

22:28.833 --> 22:31.701
Trust me, it's worth
the price of admission.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.736
I don't doubt that.

22:33.771 --> 22:36.040
Chloe, I can't
thank you enough.

22:36.073 --> 22:37.508
I've been able to help
my mother pay

22:37.541 --> 22:38.608
for her medical bills

22:38.641 --> 22:40.978
and cover what my
financial aid didn't.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.047
And even when my daddy died,
girl,

22:43.080 --> 22:44.982
I really thought I was
gonna be done with school.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.616
I'll never forget what
you did for me.

22:46.649 --> 22:47.617
We gonna miss you, boo.

22:47.650 --> 22:48.986
Oh, you, too.

22:50.221 --> 22:51.355
We love you Chloe Addison.

22:51.388 --> 22:52.722
Take care of yourself.

22:52.756 --> 22:54.959
I'm a miss you girls, too,
take care.

23:00.231 --> 23:02.366
Look at you, Queen's comb.

23:02.399 --> 23:05.436
I guess the apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.071
It was too easy, big bro.

23:07.104 --> 23:08.139
I will be affordably leavin'
the money

23:08.172 --> 23:10.040
on the table for the next
person to get.

23:10.074 --> 23:12.943
And I was tired of asking
Queen for money,

23:12.977 --> 23:14.812
having to justify why
I needed it.

23:14.845 --> 23:17.747
So, I took matters into
my own hands.

23:17.781 --> 23:20.484
Took matters into your
own hands, huh?

23:20.518 --> 23:22.419
You sound just like her.

23:22.453 --> 23:23.454
I just hope that you
was smart enough

23:23.487 --> 23:24.522
to start stinkin' your paper

23:24.555 --> 23:26.323
instead of spending it
on stupid shit

23:26.357 --> 23:28.392
like purses and clothes, hmm.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.028
You got a lot to learn.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.330
Come on, junior, let's
get your things.

23:33.364 --> 23:34.031
Dear diary.

23:34.064 --> 23:34.865
Don't touch me.

23:34.899 --> 23:36.133
I'm leaving Atlanta
and going back

23:36.167 --> 23:38.936
to Dallas officially a
college graduate.

23:38.969 --> 23:41.138
I've had my fun these
past four years,

23:41.172 --> 23:42.573
but parents have let
my family know

23:42.606 --> 23:44.741
that I'm ready to be
in the family business.

23:44.775 --> 23:46.243
All right, I will
get your things

23:46.277 --> 23:48.012
and I will take them to
your apartment

23:48.045 --> 23:50.181
while you get your hair done.

23:50.214 --> 23:51.215
My apartment?

23:51.248 --> 23:52.283
Yes, ma'am.

23:52.316 --> 23:54.652
It's one of your graduation
presents from Queen.

23:54.684 --> 23:55.586
Shut up.

23:55.619 --> 23:58.088
Rent paid for the entire year.

23:58.122 --> 23:59.089
Get out.

23:59.123 --> 24:00.291
She wanted to give you
the keys herself but,

24:00.324 --> 24:02.826
you know, her and pops
had to make a run.

24:03.726 --> 24:05.529
Bruh, anyways, when
you get through

24:05.563 --> 24:07.131
just call me and I'll
come pick you up.

24:07.164 --> 24:09.433
That's okay, bro,
Ri's gonna drop me off.

24:09.466 --> 24:10.601
Okay, cool, cool.

24:10.634 --> 24:12.203
Well, um, I will text
you the address

24:12.236 --> 24:16.040
and, uh, I'll pick you
up for dinner at eight.

24:16.073 --> 24:16.739
Wait?

24:16.774 --> 24:18.142
You're picking me up for dinner?

24:18.175 --> 24:19.742
Are you sick, bro.

24:19.777 --> 24:20.710
Oh, my God, are you dying?

24:20.743 --> 24:21.744
Girl, stop.

24:21.779 --> 24:23.447
Let me know, 'cause
I been gone.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.815
You just be ready.

24:24.848 --> 24:25.983
I stay ready.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.285
Thank you.

24:28.319 --> 24:29.420
Oh, my gosh.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.803
Oh, my gosh, Chloe,
you look so good.

24:45.836 --> 24:47.438
You look so good.

24:47.471 --> 24:48.839
Oh, my gosh, you have no idea

24:48.872 --> 24:50.808
how much I've missed you.

24:50.841 --> 24:53.777
Not as much as I
missed you, oh, my gosh.

24:53.811 --> 24:56.780
And this place, it's
really nice.

24:56.814 --> 24:57.648
Thank you.

24:57.681 --> 24:59.250
Girl, I'm so proud of you.

24:59.283 --> 25:00.551
Girl, I'm thinking
about putting

25:00.584 --> 25:02.319
a bar over here and then
I'm also thinking

25:02.353 --> 25:04.788
about maybe having some
live jazz music

25:04.822 --> 25:07.591
to, you know, make the
experience better.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.193
Now that's how you boss up.

25:09.226 --> 25:10.361
Period.

25:10.394 --> 25:11.895
But, you know, I can't
take all the credit.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.430
You know, your mom
helped me out a lot.

25:13.464 --> 25:15.466
Girl, you know she loves you.

25:15.499 --> 25:17.167
And I love me some Queen.

25:18.636 --> 25:19.903
Taking me in all those years ago

25:19.937 --> 25:21.905
after my mom died.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.774
Girl, you know you're family.

25:25.075 --> 25:26.143
But there's one thing I know

25:26.176 --> 25:28.479
is that you need to fix
this hair, girl,

25:28.512 --> 25:29.346
come on, let's go.

25:29.380 --> 25:30.481
Yes, please.

25:44.061 --> 25:46.664
So when was the last
time you talked to Kelly?

25:46.697 --> 25:48.432
A few days ago.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.134
How is she doing?

25:50.167 --> 25:51.835
She just got a
summer internship

25:51.869 --> 25:53.871
in the district
attorney's office.

25:55.939 --> 25:56.974
But wait a minute.

25:57.007 --> 25:58.642
Why are you asking me
how she's doing?

25:58.676 --> 26:00.744
You could call and ask
her yourself.

26:00.779 --> 26:01.612
No, I can't.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.813
And why not?

26:04.248 --> 26:05.215
You know why.

26:06.483 --> 26:07.818
Chloe, that was six years ago.

26:07.851 --> 26:10.087
Kelly ain't trippin' over
the bullshit no more.

26:11.021 --> 26:12.623
Ever since she found
out about her mom

26:12.656 --> 26:14.058
and the things she was doing,

26:14.091 --> 26:16.427
our relationship has
never been the same.

26:17.695 --> 26:19.129
But I was the one that
accidentally let

26:19.163 --> 26:20.864
the cat out the bag and
she forgave me.

26:20.898 --> 26:22.199
Exactly.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.734
But she's always been
closer to you, Ri.

26:23.768 --> 26:28.072
Uh, no, because I talked
to her and apologized.

26:28.105 --> 26:30.040
But, believe it or not, Chloe,

26:30.074 --> 26:32.276
she has forgiven you, too, okay?

26:33.544 --> 26:35.446
A bond like ours might bend,

26:35.479 --> 26:37.348
but it never breaks.

26:38.549 --> 26:40.651
Then how come every
time I return home,

26:40.684 --> 26:42.787
she never return any of
my phone calls

26:42.821 --> 26:44.288
or try to make time to see me?

26:44.321 --> 26:47.124
She's a full-time law student,
Chloe.

26:47.157 --> 26:49.426
I hardly have time for a
social anymore

26:49.460 --> 26:50.994
if it makes you feel better.

26:53.097 --> 26:54.965
We be doing too much.

26:59.002 --> 27:01.004
Have you talked to
Cedric lately?

27:02.506 --> 27:04.241
It's been a minute.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.476
Why do you ask?

27:07.010 --> 27:09.346
Oh, so you haven't heard?

27:09.380 --> 27:10.114
Yes.

27:10.147 --> 27:11.682
Haven't heard what?

27:11.715 --> 27:13.417
That he has a girlfriend.

27:13.450 --> 27:14.184
He has a what?

27:14.218 --> 27:15.185
Mm-hmm.

27:15.219 --> 27:17.654
She comes here to get
her hair and makeup done

27:17.688 --> 27:18.555
all the time.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.860
To a beauty salon that
my best friend owns?

27:21.892 --> 27:23.227
Uh, do not go there.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.962
You wouldn't dare cut
off your nose

27:24.995 --> 27:26.497
just to spite your face,

27:26.530 --> 27:28.132
so why would you expect me to?

27:30.601 --> 27:31.935
You right.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.604
But I still wouldn't
think that my best friend-

27:33.637 --> 27:35.205
- Okay, out of respect for you,

27:35.239 --> 27:38.642
I've never taken her
on as a client of mine.

27:39.878 --> 27:42.946
Even though she has
requested me three times,

27:42.980 --> 27:44.214
but she's never late,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.150
she's referred tons of people

27:46.183 --> 27:48.652
and she tips extremely well.

27:50.587 --> 27:51.622
You know what?

27:51.655 --> 27:52.923
I don't even know why
I'm trippin'.

27:52.956 --> 27:54.525
I don't know either.

27:54.558 --> 27:57.394
You literally just had the
time of your life in college.

27:57.428 --> 27:59.196
Girl, I did.

27:59.229 --> 28:01.932
And Cedric Henderson was
just another page

28:01.965 --> 28:03.133
in my playbook.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.373
You sure that's all
he was to you?

28:12.476 --> 28:14.879
There was a time when
I wanted more.

28:14.913 --> 28:17.514
Hell, I offered him this
pocketbook so many times,

28:17.548 --> 28:18.482
I lost count.

28:19.516 --> 28:20.617
He just never took it.

28:22.319 --> 28:24.688
I'm not sure if he's
just not interested in me

28:24.721 --> 28:26.957
or if he's afraid of my family.

28:26.990 --> 28:29.894
But I don't know why, my
family loves him.

28:29.928 --> 28:31.896
Yeah, as a worker,
not as someone sleeping

28:31.930 --> 28:34.064
with the family princess.

28:35.032 --> 28:38.803
Girl, Cedric ain't
crazy, he enjoys living,

28:38.837 --> 28:41.605
but I don't blame you for
being salty, so.

28:42.706 --> 28:46.076
Look, I'm tired of
talking about his sorry ass.

28:46.109 --> 28:48.780
Okay, then let's
take a trip down

28:48.813 --> 28:49.814
to Pettyville and talk about

28:49.848 --> 28:51.816
his new bitch instead, okay,
girl.

28:51.850 --> 28:52.951
Last week she came

28:52.983 --> 28:54.985
through here looking
crazy as hell, okay?

28:55.018 --> 28:56.253
What does she look
like anyways,

28:56.286 --> 28:57.387
'cause I know she don't
look better than me.

28:57.421 --> 28:58.422
Ratchet as hell, girl,
she could never.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.256
You know what?

28:59.289 --> 29:00.724
I'll go give Cedric
my pocketbook

29:00.758 --> 29:01.992
if y'all don't hurry up.

29:02.025 --> 29:03.527
Okay, I'm a need you not
to talk to me like this.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.295
Who is this?

29:05.329 --> 29:06.663
Tonight my family threw me

29:06.697 --> 29:08.131
a surprise graduation party,

29:08.165 --> 29:09.466
which they really
could have kept,

29:09.500 --> 29:11.068
because most of those
folks look like

29:11.101 --> 29:13.136
their drug customers,

29:13.170 --> 29:15.005
except for my family
and friends, of course.

29:15.038 --> 29:16.139
Congratulations.

29:22.012 --> 29:23.080
Thank you.

29:26.183 --> 29:28.887
It's so great to see all of you.

29:28.920 --> 29:29.787
Thank you.

29:32.055 --> 29:33.090
Hi, Mama.

29:33.123 --> 29:34.558
Hi, baby, I'm so
proud of you being

29:34.591 --> 29:36.794
the first Addison to
graduate from college.

29:36.828 --> 29:37.661
Thank you.

29:37.694 --> 29:38.562
Move, Mama.

29:38.595 --> 29:39.196
Granny!

29:39.229 --> 29:41.331
Welcome home, baby girl.

29:42.065 --> 29:43.333
I'm so proud of you.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.035
Thank you, I missed you.

29:45.068 --> 29:46.737
I missed you, too.

29:46.771 --> 29:47.906
Daddy's little princess.

29:47.939 --> 29:49.506
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.942
Thank you, Dad.

29:50.975 --> 29:51.809
You got me good, bro.

29:53.043 --> 29:55.045
I can't believe you
kept all this a secret.

29:55.078 --> 29:57.080
Shit, Queen threatened
to kick my butt

29:57.114 --> 29:58.115
if I would have told you.

29:58.148 --> 29:59.249
I sure did.

29:59.283 --> 30:01.986
He did a great job
keeping the secret, too.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.755
All right.

30:04.756 --> 30:06.423
- Man.
- What's up, man?

30:06.456 --> 30:08.559
I thought I told you
to be here at 8 p.m.

30:08.592 --> 30:10.093
so you could at least say
congratulations

30:10.127 --> 30:11.728
with the family.

30:11.763 --> 30:13.530
Bro, I was waitin' on Big P.

30:13.564 --> 30:16.333
His ass was late, so I
couldn't make it.

30:16.366 --> 30:17.734
Enough of all that
mushy stuff.

30:17.769 --> 30:19.136
Congratulations, Sis.

30:19.169 --> 30:20.137
I see something over there

30:20.170 --> 30:21.171
that's lookin'
mighty delightful.

30:21.204 --> 30:23.106
I'm a have to catch you later.

30:23.140 --> 30:24.842
Catch you later, bro.

30:24.876 --> 30:26.778
Baby girl.

30:26.811 --> 30:27.779
Hi, Uncle Trent.

30:27.812 --> 30:29.179
Hey, look at ya,

30:29.212 --> 30:31.049
looking all good and
grown and shit.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.683
Lookin' just like your mama.

30:32.716 --> 30:34.217
I'm glad you don't look like

30:34.251 --> 30:35.820
your funny ass lookin'
daddy over here.

30:35.853 --> 30:36.988
Hey, man, hey, hey.

30:37.021 --> 30:39.189
My beautiful baby looks
exactly like me.

30:39.222 --> 30:40.724
What are you talking about?

30:41.692 --> 30:42.659
Yeah, whatever.

30:42.693 --> 30:45.596
Uh, Chloe, I got
something for you.

30:45.629 --> 30:46.764
Congratulations.

30:46.798 --> 30:47.865
Thank you, Uncle Trent.

30:47.899 --> 30:49.801
Hell, yeah, I think you
gonna like that.

30:49.834 --> 30:50.835
Hey, girl.

30:50.868 --> 30:52.102
Ri!

30:52.135 --> 30:54.038
Why you didn't tell
me about this?

30:54.072 --> 30:55.672
Hey, Chloe.

30:55.706 --> 30:57.341
It's good to see you.

30:57.374 --> 30:59.343
Hi, Kelly, good to see you,
too.

31:01.946 --> 31:03.447
Congratulations.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.617
Thanks, you, too, with
law school and everything.

31:09.252 --> 31:10.554
I love this.

31:10.587 --> 31:14.224
The triple threat back
together again.

31:15.225 --> 31:17.594
Okay, ladies, let's celebrate.

31:19.496 --> 31:19.998
Chloe.

31:20.031 --> 31:21.164
Hey.

31:21.198 --> 31:23.001
Congratulations, baby,
I'm so proud of you.

31:23.034 --> 31:24.501
Thank you, Tania.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.402
You're welcome.

31:26.236 --> 31:27.071
Who is he?

31:27.105 --> 31:28.438
Oh, this is my new boo.

31:28.472 --> 31:29.239
I'm Tony.

31:29.272 --> 31:30.474
Hi, I'm Chloe.

31:30.507 --> 31:32.844
We got you something
for your, uh, graduation.

31:32.877 --> 31:34.244
Thank you.

31:34.277 --> 31:37.180
Wow, you really shouldn't have.

31:37.214 --> 31:39.216
Uh, no, he shouldn't have.

31:39.249 --> 31:42.252
Um, they've got money and
we've got bills.

31:42.285 --> 31:43.387
Here you go, baby.

31:45.222 --> 31:46.523
Thanks, Tania.

31:46.556 --> 31:47.557
You're welcome.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.868
He better not have
brought that bitch with him.

32:02.439 --> 32:04.341
So I assume you made the drop?

32:05.208 --> 32:06.276
Yeah.

32:07.045 --> 32:07.945
16 keys.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.058
16 keys, huh?

32:20.091 --> 32:20.958
Yeah.

32:21.926 --> 32:22.860
16 keys?

32:24.929 --> 32:25.797
Yeah.

32:27.799 --> 32:29.867
So we straight, we good?

32:31.135 --> 32:33.403
You tell me, we straight?

32:33.437 --> 32:34.304
Good?

32:35.840 --> 32:36.707
Yeah.

32:37.741 --> 32:38.608
Of course.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.681
Look, there's some
honeys here tonight

32:44.715 --> 32:49.053
and I see somebody I
feel like entertaining,

32:49.087 --> 32:50.220
is that all right?

32:52.255 --> 32:53.858
Hey, man, enjoy yourself.

32:53.891 --> 32:56.861
Do you, be free while you can.

32:59.931 --> 33:00.932
All right.

33:02.100 --> 33:05.268
We straight?

33:05.302 --> 33:06.636
We straight.

33:13.144 --> 33:14.011
Straight.

33:36.901 --> 33:37.769
Oh, shit.

33:39.003 --> 33:39.871
Yes, sir.

33:41.239 --> 33:42.974
A whole bag of this.

33:46.010 --> 33:46.878
Yes, sir.

33:53.017 --> 33:54.684
Ooh, goddamn.

33:54.718 --> 33:56.386
That's some shit.

33:56.419 --> 33:59.422
Queen, hello, man, what
you doing in here?

33:59.456 --> 34:01.025
What is you doing?

34:03.761 --> 34:06.063
Hey, hey, hey, you flushin'
my money down the toilet.

34:06.097 --> 34:07.564
What is wrong with you?

34:07.597 --> 34:08.532
Why are you disrespecting

34:08.565 --> 34:10.433
your daughter's party like this?

34:11.803 --> 34:13.905
Did you not know my
mother's in there?

34:14.939 --> 34:16.306
And did you forget that
you have a meeting

34:16.339 --> 34:17.942
with Big P tonight?

34:19.010 --> 34:21.012
Listen, I know
about the meeting

34:21.045 --> 34:22.180
and I haven't forgot.

34:22.213 --> 34:23.047
I got this queen.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.282
The hell you do.

34:24.314 --> 34:25.950
One highlight was
that Cedric was

34:25.983 --> 34:27.885
there looking fine as hell.

34:27.919 --> 34:28.786
Hey, Cedric.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.354
Hey, what's good shawty?

34:31.388 --> 34:34.125
Thank you for coming
to my graduation party.

34:34.158 --> 34:35.425
Yeah, no doubt.

34:35.458 --> 34:38.495
I'm glad you did your
thing and got your degree.

34:39.964 --> 34:40.798
So what you plan on doing now

34:40.832 --> 34:42.099
that you graduated?

34:42.133 --> 34:44.367
Some type of office job or what?

34:44.401 --> 34:45.502
I don't know.

34:45.535 --> 34:46.904
I haven't figured it out.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.106
You see, these little binges

34:49.140 --> 34:51.242
of yours is causing
my credibility

34:51.275 --> 34:54.377
to be undermined in
these streets.

34:54.411 --> 34:56.713
Listen, anything I
do in private

34:56.746 --> 35:00.885
is never undermining your
credibility, sweetheart.

35:01.853 --> 35:03.353
You know what?

35:03.386 --> 35:04.554
You lost your edge.

35:05.622 --> 35:06.057
Yeah.

35:07.258 --> 35:09.559
You're becoming more
of a liability for me.

35:10.261 --> 35:11.262
And you know that's a price

35:11.295 --> 35:12.096
that neither one of
us can afford,

35:12.129 --> 35:13.396
so guess what?

35:13.430 --> 35:16.968
I am going to handle the
business tonight with Big P.

35:20.338 --> 35:22.340
- But Queen.
- But nothing.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.942
Now what you can do
is clean this shit up

35:26.177 --> 35:28.212
and go in there enjoy
your daughter's party

35:28.246 --> 35:31.082
'cause I'm not gonna let you
or anybody else fuck that up

35:31.115 --> 35:34.618
and if you do, nigga, I
will blow your shit back.

35:35.619 --> 35:37.721
You ain't gotta be like that,
baby.

35:39.522 --> 35:40.690
Trippin', man.

35:43.593 --> 35:45.096
Always trippin', man.

35:47.798 --> 35:48.665
Fuck!

35:51.802 --> 35:53.271
Shit.

35:53.304 --> 35:55.505
Do look clean, though.

36:01.846 --> 36:04.849
This is fun, back in there,
shit.

36:07.318 --> 36:10.021
You look really nice tonight.

36:10.054 --> 36:10.955
Wanna dance?

36:12.689 --> 36:15.492
Uh, no, I'm good, congrats,
though.

36:24.335 --> 36:25.870
Hey, Tony.

36:25.903 --> 36:26.503
Hey, Chloe.

36:26.536 --> 36:27.405
How are you?

36:27.437 --> 36:29.006
I'm doing fine, how are you?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.041
I'm well.

36:30.074 --> 36:30.707
Wait, what are you doing,
Chloe?

36:30.740 --> 36:32.877
You look so good tonight.

36:32.910 --> 36:33.945
- I just wanted to-
- What are you doing?

36:33.978 --> 36:35.846
Personally thank you

36:35.880 --> 36:37.148
for coming to my
graduation party.

36:42.820 --> 36:43.687
Hey, Ri.

36:50.694 --> 36:53.965
My Aunt Eve showed up and
as usual there was drama.

36:55.565 --> 36:56.767
Baby sister.

36:57.835 --> 36:59.569
Eve, what are you doing here?

36:59.602 --> 37:01.439
I came to
congratulate my niece

37:01.504 --> 37:02.106
and give her a gift.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.341
Yeah, okay.

37:03.374 --> 37:06.143
Yes, but, you know, I'm
so glad that you came.

37:06.177 --> 37:07.345
I'm glad, too.

37:07.378 --> 37:10.147
But you should have
told me you were coming.

37:10.181 --> 37:11.949
What are you doing here?

37:11.983 --> 37:13.483
Mama, I told Eve
about the party.

37:14.785 --> 37:18.422
Need I remind you that I am
the matriarch of this family?

37:18.456 --> 37:19.890
Mama, we know that
you're the matriarch

37:19.924 --> 37:21.092
of this family.

37:21.125 --> 37:24.561
But holding a grudge against
Eve, dishonors Ray's memory.

37:24.594 --> 37:27.298
This stubborn old witch
ain't gonna forgive nobody.

37:27.331 --> 37:28.899
She can't even forgive
her damn self.

37:28.933 --> 37:29.566
Aunt Eve!

37:29.599 --> 37:30.801
Hey, girl.

37:31.601 --> 37:33.703
Congratulations.

37:33.737 --> 37:35.406
I'm so happy to see you.

37:35.439 --> 37:36.673
Look at you.

37:36.706 --> 37:38.409
I'm so proud of you.

37:38.442 --> 37:39.709
I got you a little something.

37:39.743 --> 37:42.213
It's not much, but I
hope you like it.

37:42.246 --> 37:43.814
Oh, I'm sure I'll love it.

37:43.848 --> 37:44.614
Thank you.

37:44.647 --> 37:46.017
You look so good.

37:46.050 --> 37:47.084
Thank you.

37:50.888 --> 37:53.290
How much dick you have
to suck to buy this?

37:53.324 --> 37:55.692
- Oh, hell, nah, look.
- Mama!

37:55.725 --> 37:57.594
Thanks for the invite, sis.

37:57.627 --> 37:59.897
But I ain't gotta deal
with this bullshit.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.269
And you can't kiss my ass.

38:05.302 --> 38:06.370
Bitch.

38:06.404 --> 38:07.570
Ugh, Mama!

38:07.604 --> 38:09.273
Mama, why would you do that?

38:09.306 --> 38:10.508
Get out!

38:10.540 --> 38:11.608
What's going on?

38:11.641 --> 38:13.210
Get out now.

38:13.244 --> 38:14.644
You're not gonna stop her?

38:14.677 --> 38:15.745
You know what?

38:16.679 --> 38:18.182
Chloe, this is none of
your concern.

38:18.215 --> 38:19.984
Go enjoy your party.

38:20.017 --> 38:20.683
Go!

38:20.717 --> 38:22.286
Nothing is ever my concern.

38:24.554 --> 38:25.956
Mama, you were wrong for that

38:25.990 --> 38:27.158
and you know it.

38:27.191 --> 38:30.494
How dare you try to tell
me what's right and wrong.

38:30.528 --> 38:31.328
She know what she did.

38:32.629 --> 38:36.067
I should have never named
her after my grandmother.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.234
She doesn't deserve it.

38:37.268 --> 38:40.938
Get outta my way.

38:40.971 --> 38:44.075
Don't worry about it, baby.

38:44.108 --> 38:46.844
Get away from me with
all that affection shit.

38:46.877 --> 38:47.211
Woman.

38:48.446 --> 38:49.847
What you need to be
trying to do is trying

38:49.880 --> 38:52.383
to handle the business
with Big P tonight.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.750
I gotta make sure my
sister get back

38:53.784 --> 38:55.618
to the halfway house.

38:57.154 --> 38:59.457
We left my
geriatric graduation party

38:59.490 --> 39:01.425
and ended up at the hangout spot

39:01.459 --> 39:03.593
and wouldn't you know
it would be just

39:03.626 --> 39:04.762
as much drama there.

39:04.795 --> 39:06.230
Chloe, your grandmother
slapped the shit

39:06.263 --> 39:07.664
out of Eve.

39:07.697 --> 39:09.900
I don't blame Granny,
Eve was wrong for that.

39:09.934 --> 39:12.103
Look, y'all know
Granny don't play.

39:12.136 --> 39:13.938
They didn't have to mess up
my graduation party, though.

39:13.971 --> 39:16.440
Girl, your graduation
party is not messed up.

39:16.474 --> 39:17.740
That's why we're here.

39:21.611 --> 39:23.814
Y'all see those fine
twins over there?

39:25.748 --> 39:28.919
Girl, first the guys from
the party and now them?

39:28.953 --> 39:31.021
I need you to get your
clit in check.

39:32.790 --> 39:34.325
Stop looking at them.

39:35.359 --> 39:36.360
I can't help it.

39:37.595 --> 39:38.661
Then go talk to them.

39:38.695 --> 39:39.830
Go talk to who?

39:41.966 --> 39:42.900
No one.

39:42.933 --> 39:44.802
I have somebody else on my mind.

39:45.936 --> 39:47.471
Chloe, you're still
after Cedric

39:47.505 --> 39:48.839
after all these years?

39:48.873 --> 39:51.308
Girl, he don't want you,
let it go.

39:52.243 --> 39:52.877
Like how you need to let go

39:52.910 --> 39:54.545
of that stick in your butt?

39:54.578 --> 39:55.712
You can kiss my ass, Chloe.

39:55.745 --> 39:57.615
That's exactly what you need,

39:57.647 --> 40:01.819
a brother to kiss yo ass,
spank yo ass, lick yo ass

40:01.852 --> 40:03.686
while he stick it in that ass.

40:04.788 --> 40:06.490
Whatever, you can
both kiss my ass.

40:06.524 --> 40:08.691
I'm focused on my studies.

40:08.725 --> 40:10.461
Besides, I have my
battery operated boyfriend

40:10.494 --> 40:11.795
to handle that.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.098
Girl, a vibrator
cannot replace the touch

40:14.131 --> 40:15.266
and feel of a man.

40:15.299 --> 40:17.334
I need you to loosen up

40:17.368 --> 40:18.402
and let love slide in.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.972
Love or 10 inches?

40:23.274 --> 40:24.341
Let's go dance, y'all.

41:02.546 --> 41:03.781
Hey, watch where you're going.

41:03.814 --> 41:04.648
Or what, skank?

41:04.682 --> 41:05.883
What you gonna do about it?

41:05.916 --> 41:07.717
Bitch, don't be comin'
at my friend like that,

41:07.750 --> 41:08.953
like you really about shit.

41:08.986 --> 41:10.788
Oh, girl, please, go
through puberty

41:10.821 --> 41:11.721
before you come for me.

41:11.755 --> 41:12.957
Oh, it ain't nothing but space

41:12.990 --> 41:14.291
and opportunity, bitch.

41:14.325 --> 41:15.759
Rihanna don't entertain
this ignorance.

41:15.793 --> 41:16.994
Bitch don't be comin' at me.

41:25.502 --> 41:26.604
Girls, stop.

41:31.141 --> 41:33.811
After the fight and
Cedric blowing me off,

41:33.844 --> 41:35.913
I had to relieve my tension

41:35.946 --> 41:37.314
the best way I know how.

42:08.078 --> 42:08.946
Wake up.

42:14.418 --> 42:15.819
Dude, seriously?

42:17.021 --> 42:20.224
You need to wake up like now,
shit.

42:22.526 --> 42:23.394
Fuck.

42:35.673 --> 42:37.908
What took you so long
to open the door?

42:38.842 --> 42:40.311
It look like she's drunk.

42:44.481 --> 42:48.052
I'm not drunk, but I just
went to sleep two hours ago.

42:48.085 --> 42:49.253
So you didn't
think I was gonna get

42:49.286 --> 42:51.689
that call last night
about that fight?

42:51.722 --> 42:52.791
Those bitches started it.

42:52.823 --> 42:54.391
I don't give a damn
who started it.

42:54.425 --> 42:59.029
All I wanna know is
did you whoop that ass?

43:01.665 --> 43:04.368
Granny, you know I did.

43:04.401 --> 43:05.936
What the fuck?

43:05.969 --> 43:07.438
Good morning, ladies.

43:07.471 --> 43:08.572
I need to get to work.

43:08.605 --> 43:12.076
But can I call you later,
Chastity?

43:12.109 --> 43:13.510
Chastity?

43:13.544 --> 43:14.411
Chloe.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.982
What the hell kinda
shit is this?

43:19.016 --> 43:20.384
I mean, they don't even
know each other's name.

43:20.417 --> 43:22.086
What kind of young
people shit is this?

43:22.119 --> 43:24.488
Boy, if you don't get
your ass outta here.

43:26.825 --> 43:28.592
Chloe, come and sit
your ass down.

43:30.728 --> 43:31.695
We come over here to talk to you

43:31.729 --> 43:33.197
about the next stage
in your life

43:33.230 --> 43:35.532
and sitting over here doing
stupid shit like this?

43:35.566 --> 43:37.368
Strange men in your bed?

43:37.401 --> 43:38.369
I'm sorry, Mama.

43:39.804 --> 43:42.039
Do you not realize
who you are?

43:43.107 --> 43:45.075
You are an Addison.

43:45.109 --> 43:47.745
Your pussy is premium brand,
baby,

43:47.779 --> 43:51.482
and you lettin' some random
knockoff nigga dick you down.

43:52.216 --> 43:53.951
I taught you better than that.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.086
She was just gettin'
a little piece.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.122
Ain't nothing wrong with
getting a little piece.

43:58.155 --> 44:01.058
I mean, she did just
graduate from college.

44:01.091 --> 44:03.394
It's just the quality of
man that I don't like.

44:04.595 --> 44:08.532
Look, Chloe, now that
you've graduated from college,

44:08.565 --> 44:11.635
it's time for you to
join the family business.

44:13.437 --> 44:14.505
Are you serious?

44:15.639 --> 44:16.540
We were.

44:17.708 --> 44:18.942
But not if you gonna be
doing stupid shit

44:18.976 --> 44:20.611
like we just saw.

44:22.579 --> 44:24.883
It won't happen again,
Grandma.

44:24.915 --> 44:25.983
Chloe.

44:26.818 --> 44:28.519
Your
great-great-grandmother Eve

44:28.552 --> 44:29.319
created

44:29.353 --> 44:31.422
a lineage of strong women

44:31.455 --> 44:32.656
and started this business

44:32.689 --> 44:35.025
that held us down for years.

44:35.058 --> 44:37.961
Now it's time for you
to learn this business

44:37.995 --> 44:40.130
so that you can
continue the legacy.

44:41.932 --> 44:43.267
You have to be hard.

44:44.735 --> 44:46.069
A heart of steel.

44:47.137 --> 44:50.174
Ain't not time for that
sentimental bullshit.

44:50.207 --> 44:53.210
If a man or woman needs
to be taken down,

44:53.243 --> 44:55.579
you order the hit and
you make sure

44:55.612 --> 44:57.347
that the execution is done.

44:58.515 --> 45:02.386
Your personal business
stays your personal business.

45:03.353 --> 45:05.189
This apartment is
your sanctuary.

45:05.222 --> 45:08.358
No one should know where
you lay your head at night.

45:08.392 --> 45:10.294
We don't have time for
any more slipups.

45:10.327 --> 45:11.328
None.

45:11.361 --> 45:16.200
Our money and our lives
will be in your hands.

45:17.534 --> 45:18.535
I got it.

45:18.569 --> 45:20.971
She got it.
She got it.

45:21.004 --> 45:22.539
I been wanting to be
in the family business

45:22.573 --> 45:24.107
for a long time, Queen.

45:24.141 --> 45:25.442
Chloe, this is nothing like

45:25.476 --> 45:28.579
that little prostitution
ring you had in college.

45:28.612 --> 45:29.446
What? You didn't think I know?

45:29.480 --> 45:30.915
I know everything.

45:30.949 --> 45:32.049
So, don't try me.

45:32.082 --> 45:34.284
This is a grown
woman's business.

45:35.986 --> 45:37.087
Yes, ma'am.

45:40.190 --> 45:41.725
Mama, you think she ready?

45:43.393 --> 45:44.595
Mm, mm.

45:50.067 --> 45:51.268
Go get dressed.

45:52.703 --> 45:54.071
We got somewhere to go.

45:58.542 --> 46:01.545
Today, Queen gave me my
second graduation present

46:01.578 --> 46:03.013
and this one puts me right

46:03.046 --> 46:04.949
in the middle of the
family business.

46:04.983 --> 46:06.049
Finally.

46:10.454 --> 46:11.522
Mom.

46:11.555 --> 46:12.689
What are we doing here?

46:14.691 --> 46:15.559
Excuse me?

46:16.794 --> 46:17.661
What is my name?

46:19.263 --> 46:20.497
Queen.

46:20.531 --> 46:21.098
Queen.

46:22.132 --> 46:23.567
From now on, that's how
you will address me.

46:23.600 --> 46:27.137
I'm the queen, you're the
subject, got it?

46:28.572 --> 46:29.439
Got it.

46:31.108 --> 46:33.176
What we're
actually doing here,

46:33.210 --> 46:35.379
this is a part of your
graduation gift.

46:36.981 --> 46:39.182
This is just not a
mechanic shop, Chloe,

46:40.083 --> 46:41.618
this is one of our spots.

46:43.021 --> 46:45.757
And school is about to
be in session, ready?

46:47.759 --> 46:48.625
Good morning, Queen.

46:48.659 --> 46:50.093
What's up, Chloe?

46:50.127 --> 46:50.929
What up, bro?

46:50.962 --> 46:52.496
You ready?

46:52.529 --> 46:53.730
You ready?

46:53.765 --> 46:55.532
Yes, I'm ready.

46:55.566 --> 46:57.501
I wish y'all would stop
asking me that.

46:57.534 --> 46:58.502
I'm ready.

46:58.535 --> 46:59.536
My bad.

46:59.570 --> 47:01.104
We gonna see.

47:01.138 --> 47:02.339
Damn right.

47:05.108 --> 47:08.445
This is your best friend.

47:09.914 --> 47:11.114
You learn her.

47:12.215 --> 47:13.483
You study her.

47:15.452 --> 47:17.855
You always keep one in
the chamber and ready.

47:20.290 --> 47:21.158
Q'Wan will take you out back

47:21.191 --> 47:22.659
and teach you how to shoot.

47:25.863 --> 47:27.397
Ced about to come in here.

47:31.035 --> 47:33.270
Wipe that shit off your face.

47:33.303 --> 47:35.439
Morning, Queen.

47:35.472 --> 47:36.340
Ced.

47:36.373 --> 47:38.977
I got the van ready
for delivery.

47:39.010 --> 47:40.177
I just can't find D.A.

47:40.210 --> 47:41.278
Nah, he ain't here.

47:41.311 --> 47:43.815
I'll hit up Big P so he
can go with you.

47:43.848 --> 47:45.515
No.

47:45.549 --> 47:46.383
You go with him.

47:46.416 --> 47:47.417
Okay.

47:47.451 --> 47:49.119
We'll be here until
you get back.

47:49.152 --> 47:50.487
Say no more.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.388
Let's go.

47:57.260 --> 47:58.395
He's loyal.

47:59.162 --> 48:00.397
He's dependable.

48:01.099 --> 48:02.232
He's never give me a reason

48:02.265 --> 48:04.201
to question my trust of him.

48:04.234 --> 48:06.303
But I will put him
in a body bag.

48:07.137 --> 48:08.372
Please don't make me lose one

48:08.405 --> 48:10.875
of my best workers
behind your damn vagina.

48:11.809 --> 48:12.743
Are we clear?

48:13.811 --> 48:14.711
Yes, ma'am.

48:17.081 --> 48:18.315
Good.

48:18.348 --> 48:21.919
Come on, let me show you
the rest of the place.

48:21.953 --> 48:24.554
Here's this place, here, here.

48:36.700 --> 48:37.734
Mm, mm, mm.

48:37.769 --> 48:40.203
Good morning, baby,
did I wake you?

48:40.237 --> 48:42.305
Nah, you didn't wake me.

48:42.339 --> 48:43.941
Just making you your favorite.

48:43.975 --> 48:45.542
You're my favorite.

48:45.575 --> 48:46.778
Really?

48:46.811 --> 48:48.745
But you look good.

48:48.780 --> 48:50.313
Thank you, baby.

48:51.281 --> 48:53.785
Have I told you how
happy you make me?

48:53.818 --> 48:57.021
Hmm, just a hundred
times, but tell me again.

48:57.055 --> 48:58.890
You make me happy.

49:01.525 --> 49:03.393
So if I make you so happy,

49:03.427 --> 49:05.696
then why aren't you in my
bed every night?

49:07.597 --> 49:09.934
Come on now, you know
the answer to that.

49:12.335 --> 49:14.438
And hurry up with that plate,
please.

49:15.706 --> 49:17.407
I'm kinda hungry.

49:17.441 --> 49:19.844
So, are we still
going to the mall?

49:19.877 --> 49:20.744
You promised.

49:22.279 --> 49:24.414
We went to the mall yesterday,
sweetie.

49:25.315 --> 49:27.284
But, yes, to answer your
question, yes,

49:27.317 --> 49:28.920
we'll go to the mall.

49:30.253 --> 49:33.191
So, speaking of
making you happy.

49:33.223 --> 49:34.092
Hmm?

49:34.125 --> 49:35.726
You know why I make you happy?

49:36.693 --> 49:38.729
Because I'm a lady,

49:38.763 --> 49:39.897
because I'm feminine

49:41.298 --> 49:43.835
and because I know how to
cater to my man,

49:44.568 --> 49:47.171
unlike that pit bull in a skirt,

49:47.205 --> 49:50.174
who's running around
here looking like a man.

49:50.208 --> 49:52.043
Watch your mouth, Nina.

49:52.076 --> 49:54.078
Oh, come on, D.A.

49:54.112 --> 49:55.947
You promised.

49:55.980 --> 49:57.514
Chloe's graduated from college

49:57.547 --> 49:58.749
and there's no reason why
you're not here

49:58.783 --> 49:59.884
with me now.

49:59.917 --> 50:01.251
I mean, why are you
paying for all this

50:01.284 --> 50:02.452
if you're not gonna be here?

50:02.486 --> 50:05.288
Look, me staying here
will never happen.

50:05.957 --> 50:07.158
I mean, you knew that when

50:07.191 --> 50:08.391
you opened your legs up
to me the first time.

50:08.425 --> 50:09.894
But, but, D.A.

50:09.927 --> 50:11.361
But D.A. nothing.

50:12.295 --> 50:14.165
That pit bull in a skirt,

50:14.198 --> 50:17.835
she's the reason why you're
living the way you're living.

50:17.869 --> 50:20.171
That pit bull in a skirt,

50:20.204 --> 50:21.806
she's the reason why
you're driving

50:21.839 --> 50:23.007
the cars you're driving.

50:23.908 --> 50:25.977
That pit bull in the skirt,

50:26.010 --> 50:28.913
she's the reason why you
got fancy purses on your arm

50:28.946 --> 50:30.647
and going to the
malls every day.

50:31.548 --> 50:32.917
D.A., it's not fair.

50:32.950 --> 50:35.652
You said, you promised.

50:35.685 --> 50:36.553
Mm.

50:40.290 --> 50:41.558
Why you gettin' mad?

50:41.591 --> 50:43.693
I'm just so tired of this.

50:43.727 --> 50:45.529
How long have we been doin'
this now?

50:45.562 --> 50:48.199
Sweetheart, don't, come here,
baby.

50:48.232 --> 50:49.533
No, don't baby me.

50:50.467 --> 50:52.536
Come here, I
was just playin'.

50:52.569 --> 50:54.205
Don't come over here
touchin' on me, D.A.,

50:54.238 --> 50:55.239
I am not playin' with you.

50:55.273 --> 50:56.706
Let me tell you somethin'
baby.

50:56.740 --> 50:57.942
No, D.A., no.

51:00.077 --> 51:02.546
Girl, let me tell
you something.

51:02.579 --> 51:03.446
What?

51:04.514 --> 51:06.017
Baby, you know I love you-

51:06.050 --> 51:07.251
- Baby.
- Don't you?

51:07.285 --> 51:08.820
Yeah, you say you love me.

51:10.855 --> 51:12.290
I really mean it.

51:12.322 --> 51:15.193
I love you, baby.

51:15.226 --> 51:16.828
I love you, too.

51:16.861 --> 51:18.528
I love you a lot.

51:19.729 --> 51:20.597
Oh.

51:22.066 --> 51:22.934
Mm.

51:26.103 --> 51:27.071
I love you a lot.

51:27.104 --> 51:28.705
I love you, too.

52:33.971 --> 52:35.940
Close the door.

52:37.641 --> 52:40.077
So you in here being greedy?

52:42.013 --> 52:43.446
What?

52:43.480 --> 52:45.149
You heard me.

52:45.182 --> 52:47.018
You in here being greedy?

52:47.051 --> 52:47.952
No, Queen, Queen, I was-

52:47.985 --> 52:49.653
- Shut the fuck up.

52:51.289 --> 52:52.689
Look at this bitch nostrils

52:52.722 --> 52:54.491
and tell me what you see.

52:56.827 --> 52:57.895
- I see powder on her nose.
- What?

52:57.929 --> 52:59.397
You see
powder on her nose?

52:59.429 --> 53:00.597
No, Queen, no.

53:00.630 --> 53:01.698
It was an accident.

53:01.731 --> 53:02.732
I would never do that
shit to you.

53:02.767 --> 53:03.667
You would never do
that shit to me?

53:03.700 --> 53:04.902
Listen.

53:04.936 --> 53:05.803
You know what, you need
to handle your worker.

53:05.836 --> 53:07.305
Queen, I been knowing
you too long-

53:07.338 --> 53:08.538
- Shut the fuck up.

53:09.606 --> 53:11.508
Get your ass over here
and handle your worker.

53:11.541 --> 53:13.210
Queen, Queen, listen,
this is all

53:13.244 --> 53:14.779
a big misunderstanding.

53:14.812 --> 53:17.681
Queen, all this shit is
not necessary, Queen.

53:17.714 --> 53:19.749
There's no need for that.

53:19.784 --> 53:20.650
Ow!

53:22.787 --> 53:25.256
You better toughen
your soft ass up

53:25.289 --> 53:26.757
and I mean right the hell now.

53:26.791 --> 53:28.059
So you wanna do my shit, huh?

53:28.092 --> 53:29.994
You sitting up here fuckin'
with my powder

53:30.027 --> 53:31.095
and it's an accident?

53:31.128 --> 53:32.263
Queen.

53:32.296 --> 53:34.265
But, no, Queen, come on, please.

53:34.298 --> 53:34.999
Watch this shit.

53:35.032 --> 53:35.800
Queen, Queen.

53:35.833 --> 53:36.767
Is that what you wanna do,
huh?

53:36.801 --> 53:37.567
Queen, you are overreacting.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.436
You want this?

53:38.468 --> 53:39.337
When I, no, Queen, please.

53:39.370 --> 53:40.404
Yeah, let's have some, huh.

53:40.438 --> 53:42.173
Queen, no, Queen, come on,
please.

53:42.206 --> 53:43.573
I would never do.

53:49.046 --> 53:50.613
Queen wanted
me to stop my worker

53:50.647 --> 53:52.116
and I just couldn't do it.

53:52.149 --> 53:53.451
What does she expect?

53:53.483 --> 53:55.485
It was just my first day,

53:55.518 --> 53:57.788
but I'm gonna be ready
next time for sure.

54:02.226 --> 54:04.795
Okay, Chloe, you
play too much.

54:04.829 --> 54:06.596
Y'all know I'm a damn fool.

54:06.629 --> 54:08.531
Now this is living.

54:08.565 --> 54:10.201
I plan to live like
this one day.

54:10.234 --> 54:11.302
Right?

54:11.335 --> 54:13.670
I love the view of the
city from here.

54:13.703 --> 54:15.006
It's breathtaking.

54:15.039 --> 54:17.141
If I stay focused and
open a second shop,

54:17.174 --> 54:18.909
I could live like this, too.

54:19.642 --> 54:21.078
You will, Ri.

54:21.112 --> 54:23.047
You've been grinding
hard these last few years

54:23.080 --> 54:24.482
and it's gonna pay off.

54:24.514 --> 54:25.715
Y'all think
Rihanna's the only one

54:25.749 --> 54:27.852
that's been working hard
these last few years?

54:27.885 --> 54:28.953
What, y'all heifers
think getting

54:28.986 --> 54:31.288
into law school was a
walk in the park?

54:31.322 --> 54:32.589
Heifers?

54:32.622 --> 54:33.891
Of course not, Kelly.

54:33.924 --> 54:36.093
We know it's hard work
going after that legal gavel

54:36.127 --> 54:39.662
and I tip my glass to you.

54:41.499 --> 54:43.300
Yeah, me, too.

54:46.037 --> 54:48.105
I was thinking, Chloe,

54:48.139 --> 54:50.640
since you're big ballin',
shot callin',

54:50.673 --> 54:54.544
doing God knows what,
maybe you can help

54:54.577 --> 54:57.815
a sister out and invest
in my second salon?

54:57.848 --> 55:00.017
Your mom can vouch that
I'm good for it.

55:01.052 --> 55:01.986
Maybe one day.

55:02.853 --> 55:04.355
But right now, I'm focused

55:04.388 --> 55:05.356
on my new endeavor.

55:07.224 --> 55:08.292
Endeavors?

55:08.325 --> 55:09.393
What endeavors do you have

55:09.427 --> 55:11.062
besides letting your mom
and dad spoil you

55:11.095 --> 55:12.263
and pay your bills?

55:12.296 --> 55:13.596
Chloe, you don't have
anything else to do

55:13.630 --> 55:14.932
but shop all day.

55:14.965 --> 55:16.699
You can take some time
out of your schedule

55:16.733 --> 55:19.437
to learn about my business.

55:19.470 --> 55:21.338
No thank you, Rihanna.

55:21.372 --> 55:23.174
And I do more than shop all day.

55:24.108 --> 55:26.210
As much money as I'm
getting paid,

55:26.243 --> 55:28.245
that's exactly what I could do

55:28.279 --> 55:30.181
if I wanted to.

55:30.214 --> 55:32.817
Rihanna, Chloe is just
like Tania F. Martin,

55:32.850 --> 55:35.186
fly ass apartment,
designer clothes.

55:35.219 --> 55:37.488
But she
ain't got no job, man.

55:41.225 --> 55:42.725
I see y'all got jokes.

55:43.494 --> 55:44.829
What I'm doing takes more heart

55:44.862 --> 55:47.064
than either one of
your soft asses.

55:47.098 --> 55:49.433
With your damn blow dryer
and your legal briefs.

55:49.467 --> 55:50.935
You got that right?

55:58.342 --> 55:59.977
I'm running a stash house.

56:00.010 --> 56:01.912
A stash house?

56:01.946 --> 56:02.813
Where?

56:04.515 --> 56:07.151
Old mechanic shop
on Washington.

56:07.184 --> 56:08.319
That's a stash house?

56:09.253 --> 56:10.121
Hmm, never knew.

56:11.822 --> 56:13.057
And you still don't.

56:13.090 --> 56:15.960
So keep your damn mouth
quiet about it.

56:15.993 --> 56:16.861
Okay.

56:17.561 --> 56:19.196
So what do you do exactly?

56:20.498 --> 56:22.099
You know.

56:22.133 --> 56:23.100
Runnin' things.

56:23.834 --> 56:26.003
Making sure product goes out,

56:26.036 --> 56:28.339
money comes in and my employees

56:28.372 --> 56:29.874
are kept in line.

56:30.941 --> 56:32.742
Well, congratulations,
Miss Chloe,

56:32.776 --> 56:35.678
I didn't know you were
runnin' around doing all that.

56:36.981 --> 56:40.717
Runnin' a stash house
is dangerous.

56:40.750 --> 56:41.886
Aren't you scared?

56:43.754 --> 56:46.857
Rihanna, this runs
through my veins.

56:47.758 --> 56:49.593
I didn't ask to be a
part of the game,

56:49.627 --> 56:51.395
the game chose me.

56:51.428 --> 56:52.997
I'm just playin' my position.

56:54.331 --> 56:55.599
Wow.

56:55.633 --> 56:57.234
So you're trying to
become the next Queen

56:57.268 --> 57:00.271
instead of using your
college degree?

57:00.304 --> 57:02.106
That is so dumb.

57:02.139 --> 57:04.441
You're smart enough to
make money legally.

57:06.177 --> 57:07.710
Nah, Miss Legal Eagle,

57:08.913 --> 57:10.281
I was born for this.

57:27.231 --> 57:28.532
What up, Sam.

57:28.566 --> 57:29.767
Hey.

57:30.901 --> 57:32.336
What's going on Brady?

57:32.369 --> 57:34.104
Just the man I need to see.

57:34.138 --> 57:35.005
Sir.

57:36.874 --> 57:38.342
I need you to take this.

57:39.243 --> 57:40.110
For you.

57:41.212 --> 57:43.147
And that's for you.

57:46.584 --> 57:47.750
And that's for you.

57:48.718 --> 57:50.988
So how's everything
going out there?

57:53.357 --> 57:55.092
Everything's straight.

57:55.125 --> 57:55.826
Yeah?

57:55.859 --> 57:57.094
Makin' it happen.

57:57.127 --> 57:57.995
Okay.

57:59.663 --> 58:00.730
Where the crew?

58:00.764 --> 58:01.999
I'm here solo.

58:02.732 --> 58:03.801
No crew.

58:03.834 --> 58:06.036
- All right.
- Why, what's the problem?

58:06.070 --> 58:09.506
Look, word around town
little shawty's saying

58:09.540 --> 58:12.109
she delivered a package for you.

58:12.142 --> 58:13.010
Hah!

58:14.044 --> 58:16.080
You know nobody around
here pushes weight

58:16.113 --> 58:17.248
but the Queen.

58:17.281 --> 58:19.650
No, bruh, you not
listening to me.

58:19.683 --> 58:22.553
She said she delivered a
package for you

58:22.586 --> 58:26.390
about a year ago, a
liability package.

58:34.331 --> 58:35.766
That certain person?

58:36.500 --> 58:37.801
She better shut the fuck up

58:37.835 --> 58:40.204
'fore I choke the
shit out her ass.

58:42.773 --> 58:44.608
Hey, y'all.

58:44.642 --> 58:45.509
Eve.

58:46.377 --> 58:47.544
What are you doing here?

58:48.912 --> 58:50.814
And who is this fed
looking here?

58:50.848 --> 58:53.584
My new man, Gary.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.552
New man?
I just met you yesterday.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.389
Bro, I'm out.

58:58.422 --> 59:01.458
Yeah, man, it's a lot
going on in here.

59:01.492 --> 59:03.794
Be easy in the streets.

59:03.827 --> 59:06.430
So, brother-in-law, we
just in the neighborhood,

59:06.463 --> 59:07.531
thought we'd say hi.

59:08.966 --> 59:11.435
Now know I don't
believe that shit.

59:11.468 --> 59:14.505
All right, look, let me
hold a little something.

59:16.307 --> 59:17.541
Man, if you don't
get outta here

59:17.574 --> 59:19.443
with that bullshit.

59:19.476 --> 59:21.645
And how'd you get out
the halfway house anyway?

59:21.679 --> 59:23.681
Whoa, halfway house?

59:23.714 --> 59:24.915
Wait a minute.

59:24.948 --> 59:26.383
Wait a minute, you an addict?

59:26.417 --> 59:28.852
Uh-uh, see, I don't
do crackheads. I'm out.

59:28.886 --> 59:30.988
- Come on, baby, don't-
- Uh-uh.

59:32.356 --> 59:33.557
Come on, D.A.

59:34.525 --> 59:36.160
Let me hold a little something.

59:41.732 --> 59:43.267
You know what?

59:43.300 --> 59:45.869
I'm a let you hold
something all right.

59:46.805 --> 59:48.739
I'm taking your ass
straight to Queen.

59:48.773 --> 59:49.640
No.

59:49.673 --> 59:50.708
Let's go.

59:53.077 --> 59:54.678
Dear diary.

59:54.712 --> 59:56.815
I'm enjoying my new normal.

59:56.847 --> 59:59.049
Running the stash house
with my brother,

59:59.083 --> 1:00:00.651
learning how to shoot my piece,

1:00:00.684 --> 1:00:03.153
and seeing Cedric's sexy ass.

1:00:03.187 --> 1:00:05.055
Cedric still ain't givin'
me no play,

1:00:05.089 --> 1:00:07.725
but Queen taught me
to be patient.

1:00:07.759 --> 1:00:09.727
This is a marathon,
not a sprint.

1:00:09.761 --> 1:00:10.894
I got this.

1:00:10.928 --> 1:00:12.463
It's about to heat up in
here some more.

1:00:12.496 --> 1:00:15.599
'Cause that right there
my friends is game.

1:00:15.632 --> 1:00:17.368
Aha, gimme my money.

1:00:18.168 --> 1:00:20.871
Man, yo ass cheatin', man.

1:00:20.904 --> 1:00:22.206
Q'Wan stay winning.

1:00:23.474 --> 1:00:27.745
Damn, Cedric, why do you
always look so sexy every time

1:00:27.779 --> 1:00:28.946
I see you.

1:00:28.979 --> 1:00:31.648
Chloe, I'm tired
of telling you

1:00:31.682 --> 1:00:33.751
about these little antics.

1:00:33.785 --> 1:00:35.419
I don't want you little girl.

1:00:35.452 --> 1:00:36.954
Cedric, why you still
trying to play

1:00:36.987 --> 1:00:37.988
so hard to get?

1:00:39.056 --> 1:00:42.593
It's obvious that I'm not
a little girl anymore.

1:00:42.626 --> 1:00:43.795
Hey, yo, Ced.

1:00:43.828 --> 1:00:45.562
I need you to make a
run with me.

1:00:45.596 --> 1:00:46.930
Cool, where we going?

1:00:48.132 --> 1:00:49.967
Queen need us to make a drop.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.935
D.A. ain't answering the phone

1:00:51.969 --> 1:00:53.971
and I think she got
Big P with her.

1:00:55.774 --> 1:00:56.540
Baby sis.

1:00:57.809 --> 1:00:59.943
I got a customer coming
to pick up a package,

1:00:59.977 --> 1:01:01.311
he will ask for me

1:01:01.345 --> 1:01:03.680
and say we went to high
school together.

1:01:03.714 --> 1:01:04.982
Got it.

1:01:05.015 --> 1:01:05.850
Think you can handle things

1:01:05.884 --> 1:01:07.050
around here by yourself?

1:01:07.084 --> 1:01:09.153
Yeah, I told you I got it.

1:01:10.254 --> 1:01:12.489
All right, we gonna see.

1:01:14.024 --> 1:01:14.826
Let's ride.

1:01:29.339 --> 1:01:30.574
Hey.

1:01:30.607 --> 1:01:31.442
What's up?

1:01:31.475 --> 1:01:32.342
How can I help you?

1:01:33.410 --> 1:01:34.846
Waitin' on Q'Wan.

1:01:34.879 --> 1:01:36.046
He's not here.

1:01:36.079 --> 1:01:37.581
How can I help you?

1:01:38.615 --> 1:01:42.753
You can't, ma'am, I'll
just come back later.

1:01:42.787 --> 1:01:44.588
How do you know I
can't help you?

1:01:45.622 --> 1:01:46.523
Who are you?

1:01:48.091 --> 1:01:50.127
Me and Q'Wan went back
to high school.

1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:52.329
He said if I was ever
on this side of town,

1:01:52.362 --> 1:01:54.298
I should stop by.

1:01:56.901 --> 1:01:59.236
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1:01:59.269 --> 1:02:00.137
Follow me.

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:23.660
Ease your ass up outta there.

1:02:23.694 --> 1:02:24.595
Oh, man.

1:02:24.628 --> 1:02:25.662
And fix your clothes.

1:02:25.696 --> 1:02:26.865
All right, all right, whoa,
whoa.

1:02:26.898 --> 1:02:28.198
And get
on your knees.

1:02:28.232 --> 1:02:29.666
That go for you, too, lover.

1:02:29.700 --> 1:02:30.802
Hands up!

1:02:30.835 --> 1:02:32.703
Hands up, both of you!

1:02:34.071 --> 1:02:36.240
Now which one of you is
in charge here?

1:02:38.542 --> 1:02:40.043
I am.

1:02:40.077 --> 1:02:41.011
And you two motherfuckers
don't know who

1:02:41.044 --> 1:02:42.079
you're messin' with.

1:02:42.112 --> 1:02:45.148
So tell us, who are we dealin'
with.

1:02:45.884 --> 1:02:47.384
The Addisons.

1:02:47.417 --> 1:02:50.120
And believe me, when my
family finds out about this,

1:02:51.021 --> 1:02:53.023
you two motherfuckers
will be dead.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:57.594
Nah, ma.

1:02:57.628 --> 1:02:58.595
See, I figure if you give me

1:02:58.629 --> 1:03:01.698
just a little taste of
what you was givin' him,

1:03:01.732 --> 1:03:03.400
then I just might let you live.

1:03:04.735 --> 1:03:06.169
Come on, man, let's hurry up

1:03:06.203 --> 1:03:08.038
and get this shit over with,
man.

1:03:08.071 --> 1:03:10.140
Well, mama, time for
you to meet your maker.

1:03:10.173 --> 1:03:11.708
Oh, shit, whoa.

1:03:14.711 --> 1:03:16.380
Well, well, well.

1:03:18.883 --> 1:03:20.050
Look like got caught
with your panties

1:03:20.083 --> 1:03:22.219
around your ankles, Miss Chloe.

1:03:23.687 --> 1:03:25.255
Mm-mm, yeah.

1:03:25.289 --> 1:03:26.323
Mama, I was trying to-

1:03:26.356 --> 1:03:28.158
- What did you
just call me?

1:03:29.126 --> 1:03:31.763
Queen, Queen, I mean, Queen,
I'm sorry.

1:03:31.796 --> 1:03:33.697
Yeah, you are sorry.

1:03:33.730 --> 1:03:34.665
Stand your ass up.

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:38.335
Nigga, I didn't say
nothin' about you moving.

1:03:41.371 --> 1:03:42.706
Boys, I got it from here.

1:03:43.674 --> 1:03:45.375
Q'Wan is outside
with your money.

1:03:52.282 --> 1:03:55.085
That could have been the
death for you.

1:03:56.286 --> 1:03:58.188
I told you that one day
your pocketbook

1:03:58.221 --> 1:04:01.325
would you get you in
trouble one day, didn't I?

1:04:01.358 --> 1:04:02.225
Didn't I?

1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:05.562
And you, I told you
to come in here

1:04:05.596 --> 1:04:06.663
and buy product.

1:04:06.697 --> 1:04:09.767
I didn't tell you nothing
about fuckin' my daughter.

1:04:09.801 --> 1:04:11.368
I hope you enjoyed it

1:04:11.401 --> 1:04:13.370
because that's gonna be
the last pieces you get.

1:04:13.403 --> 1:04:14.772
Come on, Queen, no, I'm sorry.

1:04:14.806 --> 1:04:16.640
She, she, approached me, what
else I was supposed to do?

1:04:16.673 --> 1:04:18.675
Say no, motherfucker.

1:04:20.143 --> 1:04:21.478
You know what.

1:04:22.479 --> 1:04:23.547
Hold, hold.

1:04:25.049 --> 1:04:26.383
- Shoot him.
- No, no.

1:04:27.986 --> 1:04:29.887
Queen, come on, Queen,
come on now.

1:04:29.921 --> 1:04:31.089
Shoot him now.

1:04:31.121 --> 1:04:34.993
Wait, come on now,
please, please, please.

1:04:35.026 --> 1:04:36.126
I don't
think that I can.

1:04:36.159 --> 1:04:37.028
What the fuck, what you
stutterin' for.

1:04:37.061 --> 1:04:38.161
Give me this shit.

1:04:38.930 --> 1:04:39.998
You can't shoot him.

1:04:41.164 --> 1:04:43.700
Queen, come on now, whoa,
whoa, okay.

1:04:43.734 --> 1:04:44.735
Please don't shoot me.

1:04:46.004 --> 1:04:47.371
I pissed on myself.

1:04:51.408 --> 1:04:54.112
You better be glad
that you got

1:04:54.144 --> 1:04:57.414
a wife and a baby at home.

1:04:58.515 --> 1:05:01.652
Otherwise your ass
would be dead.

1:05:01.685 --> 1:05:04.789
Now you get your pissy
ass outta here.

1:05:13.530 --> 1:05:16.366
You better stop fuckin'
playing with me, Chloe.

1:05:17.701 --> 1:05:18.568
Are we clear?

1:05:30.081 --> 1:05:31.548
Dear diary.

1:05:31.581 --> 1:05:32.549
I fucked up.

1:05:41.159 --> 1:05:42.225
Baby girl.

1:05:44.528 --> 1:05:45.462
Your mother dropped me off,

1:05:45.495 --> 1:05:47.264
said she's be right back.

1:05:47.297 --> 1:05:48.732
You mind if an old lady sit

1:05:48.766 --> 1:05:50.734
and chat with you for
a little bit.

1:05:50.768 --> 1:05:52.103
You are not old

1:05:52.136 --> 1:05:53.737
and none of us see you as old.

1:05:54.438 --> 1:05:55.605
You got that right.

1:05:56.606 --> 1:05:58.810
And the reason you all
don't see me as old

1:05:58.843 --> 1:06:01.445
is because I never show
signs of weakness

1:06:01.478 --> 1:06:03.246
even when I feel weak.

1:06:05.116 --> 1:06:07.250
I smell food coming
from my kitchen.

1:06:07.284 --> 1:06:08.853
Were you in there cooking?

1:06:08.886 --> 1:06:09.686
You know I was

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:11.388
and you been sitting
out here all

1:06:11.421 --> 1:06:13.724
of this time just pouting.

1:06:13.758 --> 1:06:17.427
You know, your grandfather
is the main reason

1:06:17.461 --> 1:06:19.496
that I'm the woman
that you see now.

1:06:20.330 --> 1:06:22.299
When he left me and his kids

1:06:22.332 --> 1:06:23.333
for another woman,

1:06:24.202 --> 1:06:26.236
he taught me a very
valuable lesson.

1:06:28.172 --> 1:06:29.807
He must have really hurt you.

1:06:30.908 --> 1:06:32.375
Yes, he did.

1:06:33.376 --> 1:06:35.445
And from that day forward,

1:06:35.479 --> 1:06:37.782
I've never operated on
emotions again.

1:06:39.549 --> 1:06:41.018
What do you mean by that?

1:06:43.755 --> 1:06:46.389
Chloe, your
pocketbook can get you

1:06:46.423 --> 1:06:47.859
in a whole lot of trouble,

1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:50.795
more than it already has.

1:06:52.163 --> 1:06:53.865
What in the hell were
you thinking

1:06:53.898 --> 1:06:55.332
the other day at the shop?

1:06:57.101 --> 1:06:59.036
I don't know.

1:06:59.070 --> 1:07:00.772
I feel awful.

1:07:00.805 --> 1:07:02.539
You should, damn it.

1:07:02.572 --> 1:07:04.876
You better be glad that
this was a test

1:07:04.909 --> 1:07:06.576
and not the real thing.

1:07:06.610 --> 1:07:08.745
You better start
thinking with brass

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.413
and not your ass.

1:07:12.616 --> 1:07:14.551
You always get the money first.

1:07:14.584 --> 1:07:16.586
Fuck all that personal bullshit.

1:07:17.789 --> 1:07:19.489
And most important,

1:07:19.523 --> 1:07:21.826
you never let a man distract you

1:07:21.859 --> 1:07:22.894
from your business.

1:07:25.029 --> 1:07:25.629
I'm sorry.

1:07:26.663 --> 1:07:28.766
I slipped up and almost
put us all at risk.

1:07:30.001 --> 1:07:32.536
Queen will not stand
for any more slipups.

1:07:34.272 --> 1:07:37.541
Keep your emotions and
your pocketbook at home

1:07:37.574 --> 1:07:40.477
before you get more than
your ass whipped next time.

1:07:42.113 --> 1:07:42.980
Yes, ma'am.

1:07:44.282 --> 1:07:45.850
It's going to be time
for you to take

1:07:45.883 --> 1:07:46.851
the throne soon.

1:07:48.186 --> 1:07:50.654
Get it together now.

1:08:03.034 --> 1:08:05.770
What the hell is she doing here?

1:08:05.803 --> 1:08:08.072
Mama, stop being like that,
okay.

1:08:09.106 --> 1:08:10.740
Hi, hi, Mama.

1:08:12.877 --> 1:08:14.444
Mama, you remember the
center had called

1:08:14.477 --> 1:08:17.315
and said that she would be
released today.

1:08:17.347 --> 1:08:20.284
I remember, but I do
not recall saying

1:08:20.318 --> 1:08:22.119
that she would be in
my presence.

1:08:22.153 --> 1:08:23.221
Well, she's in your presence,

1:08:23.254 --> 1:08:24.387
'cause she got
something to say to you

1:08:24.421 --> 1:08:25.790
and you're gonna listen.

1:08:27.024 --> 1:08:29.492
Well, I'm listening.

1:08:32.362 --> 1:08:34.497
I just wanted to say that,

1:08:34.531 --> 1:08:36.000
I just wanna say that Mama,
I love you

1:08:36.033 --> 1:08:37.201
and I don't want us to-

1:08:37.235 --> 1:08:39.003
- You could have put
that shit in a damn text.

1:08:39.036 --> 1:08:40.238
See what I'm talkin' about.

1:08:40.271 --> 1:08:43.607
Wait, wait, wait, this
gone all too long, y'all.

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.977
What the hell happened
between the two of you?

1:08:46.010 --> 1:08:48.779
She was there the night
your brother was killed.

1:08:51.282 --> 1:08:53.483
You never told me that
you were there.

1:08:54.285 --> 1:08:56.620
She witnessed the whole thing.

1:08:57.621 --> 1:08:59.290
You just stood there and watched

1:08:59.323 --> 1:09:01.325
those white bastards
beat and mutilate

1:09:01.359 --> 1:09:03.227
your brother to death.

1:09:03.261 --> 1:09:04.228
I had no choice.

1:09:04.262 --> 1:09:05.729
Mama, what was I gonna do

1:09:05.763 --> 1:09:08.900
to three white men with
shotguns and knives?

1:09:08.933 --> 1:09:09.967
You could have screamed

1:09:10.001 --> 1:09:11.434
or ran to get help.

1:09:11.468 --> 1:09:13.204
Did it ever occur to you

1:09:13.237 --> 1:09:14.604
that if I would have done that,

1:09:14.638 --> 1:09:16.473
they would have killed me, too?

1:09:19.743 --> 1:09:23.613
I lost a piece of my
soul that night

1:09:23.647 --> 1:09:25.850
and it's all your fault.

1:09:28.319 --> 1:09:29.186
No.

1:09:30.321 --> 1:09:33.124
Actually, it's yours.

1:09:34.358 --> 1:09:36.093
What did you just say to me?

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:40.097
You're responsible for
his death, Mama.

1:09:41.665 --> 1:09:43.801
Mama, what is she talkin'
about?

1:09:43.834 --> 1:09:46.203
Mama, what is she talkin' about?

1:09:49.606 --> 1:09:51.608
A few weeks after Ray
was murdered,

1:09:51.641 --> 1:09:53.543
I overhead her on the
phone telling somebody

1:09:53.576 --> 1:09:54.644
what she'd done.

1:09:56.479 --> 1:09:58.382
She came home from the
grocery store one morning

1:09:58.416 --> 1:10:00.418
and found a letter from
Daddy confessing

1:10:00.450 --> 1:10:03.220
about the affair he'd
been having for months.

1:10:04.654 --> 1:10:06.589
Bastard packed his bags

1:10:06.623 --> 1:10:07.657
and left her with three kids

1:10:07.691 --> 1:10:09.126
to raise by herself.

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:11.728
Yeah, you don't have any
right to call Daddy that.

1:10:11.762 --> 1:10:13.998
Oh, she's called him worse.

1:10:14.031 --> 1:10:17.068
Especially when she found
out who he left her for.

1:10:18.302 --> 1:10:19.736
Mama, I know your
blood was boiling

1:10:19.770 --> 1:10:22.406
when you found out your
black man liked

1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:24.541
a lot of cream in his coffee.

1:10:24.574 --> 1:10:25.709
So Daddy cheated on
you with a white woman?

1:10:25.742 --> 1:10:28.079
Not just any white
woman either.

1:10:28.112 --> 1:10:29.347
His boss' wife.

1:10:29.380 --> 1:10:31.082
Shut your damn mouth, Eve.

1:10:31.115 --> 1:10:31.849
Leave that shit in the past.

1:10:31.882 --> 1:10:34.484
No, Queen deserves the truth.

1:10:34.517 --> 1:10:35.786
She needs to know
your vengeful ass

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:38.555
is the reason our father
and brother's dead.

1:10:40.623 --> 1:10:42.159
What did you do, Mama?

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:46.663
She went to go see that
hateful bigot, Mr. Hancock

1:10:46.696 --> 1:10:48.966
down at the steel mill
where daddy worked.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.534
She told him his wife was
cheating on him.

1:10:52.535 --> 1:10:54.637
Why would you do that?

1:10:54.671 --> 1:10:56.140
You know how people were
way back then.

1:10:56.173 --> 1:10:57.775
Why would you do that, Mama?

1:10:57.808 --> 1:10:59.844
I heard her say
his face filled

1:10:59.877 --> 1:11:03.214
with rage when she
found out his wife

1:11:03.247 --> 1:11:04.815
was fuckin' a nigga.

1:11:07.051 --> 1:11:08.786
Days later, Daddy's
body was found,

1:11:08.819 --> 1:11:11.588
multiple gunshot wounds
to the chest and head.

1:11:12.655 --> 1:11:15.893
A few days after that
Hancock's wife was found,

1:11:15.926 --> 1:11:18.262
naked and beaten to
death in the woods.

1:11:18.295 --> 1:11:19.163
Mama.

1:11:20.898 --> 1:11:21.866
Mama.

1:11:21.899 --> 1:11:24.001
She lied to the
cops that night

1:11:24.035 --> 1:11:25.469
when they questioned
her just like

1:11:25.503 --> 1:11:27.004
she'd been lyin' to you
all these years.

1:11:27.038 --> 1:11:30.573
Well, what does all of that
got to do with Ray's death?

1:11:30.607 --> 1:11:32.009
What does that got
to do with it?

1:11:32.043 --> 1:11:36.247
Hancock wanted our
entire family to suffer.

1:11:37.614 --> 1:11:39.549
No one knows how he found
out Ray was gay,

1:11:39.582 --> 1:11:42.019
but he paid the man
to seduce him

1:11:42.053 --> 1:11:44.055
and lure him down to
the tracks that night.

1:11:45.322 --> 1:11:49.960
After they beat him within
an inch of his life,

1:11:51.561 --> 1:11:55.866
they slit his throat and
castrated him.

1:11:57.401 --> 1:12:00.504
You told me that Ray's death

1:12:00.538 --> 1:12:02.373
was a stickup gone wrong.

1:12:02.406 --> 1:12:03.340
That's what you told me!

1:12:03.374 --> 1:12:04.308
She lied!

1:12:06.977 --> 1:12:09.780
You can hate me forever, Mama.

1:12:11.015 --> 1:12:11.849
Fuck.

1:12:11.882 --> 1:12:12.715
But I refuse to live
with the pain

1:12:12.749 --> 1:12:15.019
and the guilt anymore.

1:12:17.088 --> 1:12:21.358
I've been so focused
on my own pain,

1:12:23.561 --> 1:12:25.728
I just couldn't
understand yours.

1:12:28.232 --> 1:12:31.135
I wasn't there when you
needed me most, Eve,

1:12:32.403 --> 1:12:33.270
and I'm sorry.

1:12:35.206 --> 1:12:36.907
I'm sorry I blamed you.

1:12:38.109 --> 1:12:41.212
And I'm sorry for
treating you so badly

1:12:41.245 --> 1:12:42.346
after all of these years,

1:12:42.379 --> 1:12:44.614
baby, please forgive me.

1:13:03.834 --> 1:13:05.035
It's about LeBron up in here,
baby.

1:13:05.069 --> 1:13:06.636
Oh, man.

1:13:06.669 --> 1:13:08.305
Oh, my, man, what did you do?

1:13:08.339 --> 1:13:09.340
Perfect.

1:13:09.373 --> 1:13:10.640
Man, perfect?

1:13:10.673 --> 1:13:11.575
Man, this is not perfect.

1:13:11.609 --> 1:13:12.877
What are you talkin' about?

1:13:12.910 --> 1:13:14.445
What you talkin' about?

1:13:14.478 --> 1:13:16.514
Hey, man, you asked for this.

1:13:16.547 --> 1:13:17.915
Man, Texas taught you
how to do this.

1:13:17.948 --> 1:13:21.051
Look, man, you come here
with this Chris Brown hairdo,

1:13:21.085 --> 1:13:23.154
told me to tip the top, I
tipped the top.

1:13:23.187 --> 1:13:24.021
Tip the top?

1:13:30.561 --> 1:13:32.930
Man, if you don't
give me my hat.

1:13:32.963 --> 1:13:34.565
Hey, you just run me my money.

1:13:34.598 --> 1:13:36.233
Man, I'm fittin' to run
up outta here,

1:13:36.267 --> 1:13:36.901
that's I'm fittin' to do.

1:13:36.934 --> 1:13:38.769
Yeah, just run my money.

1:13:38.802 --> 1:13:40.670
Don't forget to tip me.

1:13:51.048 --> 1:13:52.116
Hell, yeah.

1:13:53.417 --> 1:13:54.351
Bruh, bruh.

1:14:03.294 --> 1:14:05.129
Well, well, well.

1:14:13.871 --> 1:14:16.307
D, I've been workin'
for you for five years.

1:14:18.609 --> 1:14:21.178
We're practically family,
brother.

1:14:21.212 --> 1:14:21.812
Brother.

1:14:23.013 --> 1:14:25.916
Listen, don't pull that
sentimental bullshit with me.

1:14:26.650 --> 1:14:28.652
You tampered with our product

1:14:28.686 --> 1:14:30.221
and you stole from us.

1:14:31.855 --> 1:14:34.525
Pizazz, shock the shit
out this motherfucker.

1:14:34.558 --> 1:14:35.459
No, no.

1:14:35.492 --> 1:14:37.061
D.A. we better than-

1:14:40.431 --> 1:14:41.799
Trenton, Trenton, Trenton.

1:14:43.234 --> 1:14:46.337
You know, I'm
surprised to see you

1:14:46.370 --> 1:14:47.838
in this predicament.

1:14:48.505 --> 1:14:49.506
You really disappointed me

1:14:49.540 --> 1:14:51.508
and that shit hurt me
to my heart.

1:14:53.711 --> 1:14:55.946
Queen, you know I
wouldn't steal from you.

1:14:57.047 --> 1:14:59.183
You tryna say Queen
can't count, motherfucker?

1:14:59.216 --> 1:15:00.884
You think I
can't count, nigga?

1:15:00.918 --> 1:15:03.254
Why y'all think I did it?

1:15:03.287 --> 1:15:04.121
Queen, you know.

1:15:04.154 --> 1:15:05.689
Because four kilos
come up missin'

1:15:05.723 --> 1:15:06.991
while your ass was there.

1:15:07.024 --> 1:15:07.324
Four.

1:15:08.592 --> 1:15:10.761
Look, I wasn't the only
one there last night.

1:15:10.794 --> 1:15:12.229
Who else was there?

1:15:12.263 --> 1:15:13.364
Huh?

1:15:13.397 --> 1:15:14.398
Who else was there?

1:15:16.567 --> 1:15:17.635
Queen, come on.

1:15:17.668 --> 1:15:19.670
That's what I thought.

1:15:19.703 --> 1:15:22.673
Look, maybe Eve did it.

1:15:22.706 --> 1:15:25.109
I saw her sneakin' around
there the other day.

1:15:25.976 --> 1:15:28.379
Oh, shit, you done
fucked up now.

1:15:28.412 --> 1:15:29.780
Stupid motherfucker.

1:15:29.813 --> 1:15:31.315
Nigga, what did you just say?

1:15:32.216 --> 1:15:35.619
Queen, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Queen.

1:15:35.653 --> 1:15:36.820
Chloe.

1:15:36.854 --> 1:15:37.721
Okay, okay.

1:15:37.756 --> 1:15:38.589
You got your strap?

1:15:38.622 --> 1:15:39.690
Look, D.A., come on.

1:15:40.991 --> 1:15:42.559
Baby girl, you don't wanna
do this don't, don't.

1:15:42.593 --> 1:15:43.961
Shoot this
motherfucker.

1:15:43.994 --> 1:15:45.796
Don't, Queen,
please.

1:15:45.829 --> 1:15:47.598
No, please, Queen.

1:15:50.034 --> 1:15:51.735
Queen, I was gonna shoot him.

1:15:51.770 --> 1:15:53.103
Yeah.

1:15:53.137 --> 1:15:54.004
I know.

1:15:55.439 --> 1:15:58.208
I'll let you know when I
want blood on your hands.

1:15:59.109 --> 1:16:01.879
Besides, your ass was takin'
too long.

1:16:02.980 --> 1:16:05.482
Come on, your Granny
cooked us something to eat.

1:16:07.651 --> 1:16:09.253
Y'all clean this
motherfucker up.

1:16:09.286 --> 1:16:11.622
Today we
executed Trent.

1:16:11.655 --> 1:16:13.157
I thought I was ready to
pull the trigger,

1:16:13.190 --> 1:16:15.492
but I hesitated and Queen
didn't want me

1:16:15.526 --> 1:16:17.461
to be the one to do it.

1:16:17.494 --> 1:16:19.730
I have a feeling that
the time is gettin' near

1:16:19.764 --> 1:16:21.298
and I better be ready.

1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:44.988
Hey, buddy.

1:16:45.022 --> 1:16:45.923
Buddy, what you doing?

1:16:45.956 --> 1:16:47.458
Get out of the basket.

1:16:47.491 --> 1:16:49.927
Yeah, you found the little
gift I got you.

1:16:50.561 --> 1:16:51.595
D.A., come on, you know

1:16:51.628 --> 1:16:53.597
that boy doesn't need
anymore toys.

1:16:54.531 --> 1:16:55.866
Man, he gets the best.

1:16:55.899 --> 1:16:57.701
He's the baby, he's my baby.

1:16:57.735 --> 1:17:00.738
Isn't that right,
isn't that right?

1:17:00.772 --> 1:17:02.639
Okay, anyway, how
was your day?

1:17:03.707 --> 1:17:06.443
Same old gangsta shit,
that's all.

1:17:06.477 --> 1:17:07.978
Who was it today?

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:11.081
It doesn't matter.

1:17:12.082 --> 1:17:13.785
The only thing that
matters is that I'm here

1:17:13.818 --> 1:17:18.088
with my baby and my other baby.

1:17:20.124 --> 1:17:21.191
I'm glad you're here, too,

1:17:21.225 --> 1:17:22.726
but you know what, let
me put him down

1:17:22.761 --> 1:17:25.662
for his nap and I'll
be right back.

1:17:25.696 --> 1:17:27.331
Tell Daddy bye-bye.

1:17:27.364 --> 1:17:29.233
Say, see you later.

1:17:30.802 --> 1:17:31.935
I'll be back.

1:17:32.703 --> 1:17:33.937
Boy's crazy.

1:17:33.971 --> 1:17:36.039
He's gettin' big, too.

1:17:43.313 --> 1:17:44.181
Okay, so.

1:17:47.918 --> 1:17:49.153
Where were we?

1:17:51.588 --> 1:17:53.624
Wherever you wanna be.

1:17:53.657 --> 1:17:56.593
You know it could be like
this all the time, right?

1:17:56.627 --> 1:17:57.494
The only thing you have to do

1:17:57.528 --> 1:18:00.431
is just move in with me
and the baby.

1:18:00.464 --> 1:18:01.331
I miss you.

1:18:02.966 --> 1:18:04.935
Come on, D.A.

1:18:04.968 --> 1:18:06.603
Why would I do that?

1:18:08.539 --> 1:18:11.275
Don't you know a man never
leaves his wife

1:18:12.109 --> 1:18:13.410
for his side chick.

1:18:14.144 --> 1:18:16.246
I'm your side chick, D.A.?

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:18.682
That's what you think about me?

1:18:18.715 --> 1:18:21.084
We have a son together.

1:18:21.118 --> 1:18:23.153
I am not your side chick.

1:18:23.187 --> 1:18:24.455
Don't act surprised now.

1:18:24.488 --> 1:18:26.123
You knew what you was gettin'
into

1:18:26.156 --> 1:18:27.691
when you was fuckin' with me.

1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:31.896
Just 'cause we got that
little brat back there

1:18:31.930 --> 1:18:33.730
doesn't change things.

1:18:33.765 --> 1:18:34.933
Brat?

1:18:34.965 --> 1:18:37.401
That brat in there is our son.

1:18:37.434 --> 1:18:38.335
You know what D.A.?

1:18:38.368 --> 1:18:39.904
You said you were gonna leave.

1:18:39.938 --> 1:18:40.839
You know what?

1:18:40.872 --> 1:18:42.105
I'm tired of dealing with this.

1:18:42.139 --> 1:18:45.008
Look, I told you not to
bring this shit up again.

1:18:45.042 --> 1:18:46.945
And since you did,
it's time for you

1:18:47.010 --> 1:18:48.512
to get a dose of reality.

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:52.182
Now whatever you
think about Queen,

1:18:52.216 --> 1:18:54.985
that's my Queen, you got it?

1:18:55.018 --> 1:18:56.520
Your Queen?

1:18:56.553 --> 1:18:57.956
What about me, D.A.?

1:18:57.988 --> 1:18:59.690
What about me and your son?

1:18:59.723 --> 1:19:00.557
What are we to you?

1:19:00.591 --> 1:19:01.325
Fuck y'all.

1:19:01.358 --> 1:19:02.593
No, you're not going anywhere.

1:19:02.626 --> 1:19:04.595
I'm not finished talking to you.

1:19:04.628 --> 1:19:05.395
D.A.

1:19:06.263 --> 1:19:08.732
We're not finished,
you know what?

1:19:08.766 --> 1:19:10.100
Fuck you, D.A.

1:19:13.570 --> 1:19:14.571
This shit is bogus.

1:19:31.990 --> 1:19:32.757
Oh, God.

1:19:33.791 --> 1:19:34.725
I should have worn
different shoes.

1:19:34.759 --> 1:19:35.860
My feet hurt.

1:19:35.894 --> 1:19:37.896
Rihanna, why are you up
dancing anyway?

1:19:37.929 --> 1:19:39.797
No one's even here yet.

1:19:39.831 --> 1:19:41.365
Look, she's practicing

1:19:41.398 --> 1:19:43.200
because she's gonna
need those moves

1:19:43.233 --> 1:19:45.202
to find suitable dick.

1:19:45.235 --> 1:19:46.403
All he needs to be
is breathing

1:19:46.436 --> 1:19:49.039
and that's suitable
enough for you.

1:19:49.072 --> 1:19:51.943
Worry about your own dry
ass pocketbook, heifer.

1:19:51.976 --> 1:19:53.477
At least mine doesn't
have cobwebs on it.

1:19:53.510 --> 1:19:54.244
Ladies!

1:19:54.278 --> 1:19:55.312
No cat fights tonight.

1:19:55.345 --> 1:19:57.147
Y'all need to stop this
shit right now

1:19:57.180 --> 1:19:58.783
because I have had enough of it.

1:19:59.884 --> 1:20:02.252
Now I'm gonna go and get
us some drinks

1:20:02.286 --> 1:20:05.757
and while I'm gone, you
two squash this beef.

1:20:11.228 --> 1:20:12.997
Kelly, what have I done to you

1:20:13.031 --> 1:20:14.565
that was so horrible?

1:20:15.666 --> 1:20:16.533
You know.

1:20:18.135 --> 1:20:19.403
You're right.

1:20:19.436 --> 1:20:20.872
I shouldn't have taken
those pictures

1:20:20.905 --> 1:20:22.807
of your mom that night.

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:23.808
But I only took them to show you

1:20:23.841 --> 1:20:25.009
that she was there

1:20:25.043 --> 1:20:27.779
so that when I told you,
you would believe me.

1:20:27.812 --> 1:20:30.280
But I wasn't the one that
leaked them, I promise.

1:20:30.314 --> 1:20:32.817
Then how'd they get
leaked then?

1:20:32.850 --> 1:20:34.052
The kids in school
made fun of me

1:20:34.084 --> 1:20:36.054
for years after that.

1:20:36.086 --> 1:20:37.789
Chloe, you were supposed
to be my friend.

1:20:37.822 --> 1:20:39.189
How could you do that to me?

1:20:39.222 --> 1:20:40.190
For the umpteenth time,

1:20:40.223 --> 1:20:41.793
it wasn't me.

1:20:41.826 --> 1:20:42.961
I let Rihanna borrow my phone

1:20:42.994 --> 1:20:45.095
to take pictures of her
stupid boyfriend

1:20:45.128 --> 1:20:46.998
and he's the one that
leaked them.

1:20:47.031 --> 1:20:48.365
Why are you mad at her?

1:20:48.398 --> 1:20:50.100
Rihanna genuinely apologized

1:20:50.133 --> 1:20:52.003
that she had nothing
to do with it.

1:20:52.036 --> 1:20:53.403
You took the photos

1:20:53.437 --> 1:20:55.272
and I knew you wanted
them to get out.

1:20:55.305 --> 1:20:56.841
You never let anyone
use your phone.

1:20:56.874 --> 1:20:58.508
You did that shit on purpose.

1:21:00.011 --> 1:21:02.046
Kelly, I'm sorry.

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:03.347
I really am.

1:21:04.048 --> 1:21:05.248
I was stupid and young

1:21:05.282 --> 1:21:07.852
and I didn't know how my
actions would hurt you.

1:21:08.886 --> 1:21:09.753
Please.

1:21:10.654 --> 1:21:11.622
Forgive me.

1:21:15.225 --> 1:21:16.326
I forgive you.

1:21:17.127 --> 1:21:18.428
Good.

1:21:18.462 --> 1:21:21.131
So this means we can
be true friends again?

1:21:22.232 --> 1:21:25.970
It means I'll tolerate you

1:21:26.004 --> 1:21:28.138
when you're around my friend,
Rihanna.

1:21:30.707 --> 1:21:32.743
Tell Rihanna I'll call
her tomorrow.

1:21:43.921 --> 1:21:45.589
Chloe, what did you say?

1:21:45.622 --> 1:21:47.058
I tried to apologize
and she wasn't trying

1:21:47.091 --> 1:21:48.625
to hear it.

1:21:48.659 --> 1:21:49.693
So I'm done.

1:21:49.726 --> 1:21:51.194
Let me go talk to her.

1:21:51.228 --> 1:21:53.463
No, you're not leaving

1:21:53.497 --> 1:21:55.165
and I'm done talking about her.

1:21:55.198 --> 1:21:56.667
Let's enjoy our night out.

1:21:57.567 --> 1:21:58.635
Okay.

1:22:00.772 --> 1:22:02.172
But I am gonna talk to
her while I'm staying

1:22:02.205 --> 1:22:03.306
at her place.

1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:05.308
Why are you staying
at her place?

1:22:06.044 --> 1:22:07.812
My place is being fumigated.

1:22:07.845 --> 1:22:10.148
Speaking of, could I
leave a couple of boxes

1:22:10.180 --> 1:22:11.115
over at your place so
I don't have

1:22:11.149 --> 1:22:12.984
to buy storage?

1:22:13.017 --> 1:22:15.086
Sure, but fumigated.

1:22:15.119 --> 1:22:17.088
Ew, gross, you got the cooties.

1:22:17.121 --> 1:22:18.756
Girl, shut up.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:25.429
Look who just arrived.

1:22:26.496 --> 1:22:28.465
Go ahead, make a
fool of yourself

1:22:28.498 --> 1:22:31.102
because if you can make
a fool of yourself,

1:22:31.135 --> 1:22:32.870
then I can go and talk to Kelly.

1:22:33.938 --> 1:22:36.174
Are you gonna be okay
by yourself?

1:22:36.206 --> 1:22:37.708
Girl, hell, yes.

1:22:37.741 --> 1:22:38.776
My man is here.

1:22:40.011 --> 1:22:41.378
Your man.

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:42.947
Yeah, okay.

1:22:43.848 --> 1:22:45.615
Hater, bye.

1:22:50.487 --> 1:22:52.622
Is my family paying
you to follow me?

1:22:53.490 --> 1:22:55.860
Girl, ain't nobody
following you.

1:22:55.893 --> 1:22:57.195
I'm here enjoying myself

1:22:57.227 --> 1:22:59.696
or at least I was till
you appeared in my face.

1:23:01.032 --> 1:23:02.332
Where's your fiance?

1:23:04.001 --> 1:23:04.936
In my bed.

1:23:06.503 --> 1:23:07.671
Damn.

1:23:07.704 --> 1:23:09.740
Why do you have to be
so rude to me?

1:23:10.674 --> 1:23:11.575
'Cause you're the
type of woman

1:23:11.608 --> 1:23:13.610
that your mother
warned me about.

1:23:14.812 --> 1:23:16.781
You only after two things.

1:23:16.814 --> 1:23:19.917
My money and my dick.

1:23:19.951 --> 1:23:20.985
Now what do you want?

1:23:23.054 --> 1:23:25.489
I just wanted to say hi.

1:23:25.522 --> 1:23:26.389
Why?

1:23:27.091 --> 1:23:27.959
Damn.

1:23:31.394 --> 1:23:33.663
You remember when
we were younger

1:23:33.697 --> 1:23:36.968
and I got into a fight with,
um, freckle face Tania?

1:23:39.469 --> 1:23:41.139
Now, I remember,
freckle face Tania,

1:23:41.172 --> 1:23:42.439
yeah, I remember that.

1:23:42.472 --> 1:23:44.641
Man, she was like two feet
taller than you, right?

1:23:44.674 --> 1:23:47.879
Shoot, I didn't care,
she stole my cookies.

1:23:49.247 --> 1:23:50.782
Yeah, well, they must
have been some good cookies,

1:23:50.815 --> 1:23:52.282
'cause you stomped over
her all bowed

1:23:52.315 --> 1:23:54.384
like you was gonna do something.

1:23:54.417 --> 1:23:57.855
Everybody knows fudge
stripes are the best.

1:23:57.889 --> 1:23:59.689
Must be, I mean, shit,
you got your ass beat

1:23:59.723 --> 1:24:00.858
over them cookies.

1:24:02.226 --> 1:24:03.293
Yeah, I did.

1:24:04.162 --> 1:24:06.530
But you came to my rescue.

1:24:09.332 --> 1:24:10.400
Yeah, well.

1:24:11.368 --> 1:24:12.236
I couldn't just sit back

1:24:12.270 --> 1:24:13.805
and let her do you like that.

1:24:19.309 --> 1:24:20.878
Aw, come on, girl.

1:24:20.912 --> 1:24:21.913
Let's go dance.

1:24:34.658 --> 1:24:37.694
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1:24:37.727 --> 1:24:38.595
Girl.

1:24:38.628 --> 1:24:40.463
Why do you have to be so loud?

1:24:42.066 --> 1:24:43.301
What's in the box?

1:24:43.333 --> 1:24:44.734
Just the hair products
you said I could keep here

1:24:44.769 --> 1:24:47.470
while my place is
being fumigated.

1:24:47.504 --> 1:24:49.639
Okay, just leave
it over there.

1:24:52.742 --> 1:24:56.214
So, who did you end up
going home with last night,

1:24:56.247 --> 1:24:58.648
'cause I know you went
home with somebody.

1:24:59.482 --> 1:25:01.853
Wait, is he still here?

1:25:01.886 --> 1:25:02.920
Girl, hush.

1:25:02.954 --> 1:25:04.454
Ain't nobody here but me.

1:25:08.226 --> 1:25:10.161
So, do you remember
what I told you

1:25:10.194 --> 1:25:11.628
when we were 12?

1:25:12.230 --> 1:25:13.396
12?

1:25:13.430 --> 1:25:16.433
I barely remember what
you told me last week

1:25:16.466 --> 1:25:17.734
and you look like shit.

1:25:17.768 --> 1:25:19.270
Are you okay?

1:25:19.303 --> 1:25:20.570
Yeah, I'm good.

1:25:20.604 --> 1:25:21.973
I just had a long night.

1:25:24.108 --> 1:25:26.210
But to jog your memory,

1:25:26.244 --> 1:25:29.313
I told you that one day,

1:25:29.347 --> 1:25:34.551
one day I was gonna get
me some Ceddy, Ced, Ced.

1:25:35.253 --> 1:25:38.356
Holy shit, what the, wait.

1:25:38.388 --> 1:25:39.857
When did you and Ced hook up?

1:25:39.891 --> 1:25:42.760
Girl, last night
after the club.

1:25:42.793 --> 1:25:43.660
Are you serious?

1:25:44.494 --> 1:25:45.930
And y'all slept together?

1:25:47.031 --> 1:25:48.665
Yes, honey.

1:25:48.698 --> 1:25:50.301
I was sliding down his pole

1:25:50.334 --> 1:25:52.702
like a stripper dancin'
for her rent money.

1:25:52.736 --> 1:25:55.438
Ah, well, it's
about damn time.

1:25:55.472 --> 1:25:57.507
Give me all of the
juicy details.

1:25:57.540 --> 1:25:58.376
How did it go down?

1:25:58.408 --> 1:26:00.510
Wait, don't tell me.

1:26:00.543 --> 1:26:03.014
He walked up to you and
finally told you

1:26:03.047 --> 1:26:04.916
how much he's always wanted you?

1:26:06.183 --> 1:26:08.286
Girl, no.

1:26:08.319 --> 1:26:09.719
Well, what happened?

1:26:10.955 --> 1:26:13.991
Well, after you left, I
saw him standing

1:26:14.025 --> 1:26:15.725
at the bar.

1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:17.795
I was flirtin' with him,
as usual,

1:26:17.828 --> 1:26:18.829
you know me.

1:26:20.398 --> 1:26:22.366
What are you drinkin'?

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.101
Aw, it's a whiskey sour.

1:26:24.135 --> 1:26:25.269
Ooh, I've always wanted to-

1:26:25.303 --> 1:26:28.339
- Come on, hey, Chloe, Chloe,
stop, bruh.

1:26:28.372 --> 1:26:29.874
Chloe, come on now, give
me my damn drink, man.

1:26:29.907 --> 1:26:30.775
Okay.

1:26:33.077 --> 1:26:34.912
While my back was turned to him,

1:26:34.946 --> 1:26:36.746
I slipped a little relaxation
powder in his drink,

1:26:36.781 --> 1:26:38.548
What's relaxation powder?

1:26:39.549 --> 1:26:42.420
A roofie.

1:26:42.452 --> 1:26:43.586
So, then...

1:26:52.462 --> 1:26:54.065
Yo, Chloe, is that you?

1:26:54.098 --> 1:26:55.232
Shh.

1:27:01.138 --> 1:27:03.573
Yo, what's going on, like.

1:27:18.655 --> 1:27:19.924
So you drugged him?

1:27:21.491 --> 1:27:23.995
No, I helped him relax.

1:27:24.028 --> 1:27:25.262
Relax?

1:27:25.296 --> 1:27:27.231
Chloe, you put
something in his drink

1:27:27.264 --> 1:27:28.732
without his permission.

1:27:28.766 --> 1:27:30.835
That's called drugging him.

1:27:30.868 --> 1:27:32.702
What the hell is the
matter with you?

1:27:32.736 --> 1:27:34.772
First off, you need to watch

1:27:34.805 --> 1:27:36.407
who you're raising
your voice at.

1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:37.540
I'm not Kelly.

1:27:37.574 --> 1:27:39.076
No, you're not Kelly,

1:27:39.110 --> 1:27:41.112
because Kelly's actually
doing something positive

1:27:41.145 --> 1:27:42.446
with her life.

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:43.848
I don't know what the
hell's been going on

1:27:43.881 --> 1:27:44.581
with you lately.

1:27:44.614 --> 1:27:45.983
First, it was the mechanic shop

1:27:46.017 --> 1:27:47.251
and now this?

1:27:47.284 --> 1:27:48.953
Now this what?

1:27:49.686 --> 1:27:51.255
I'm taking control of my life.

1:27:51.288 --> 1:27:53.891
Oh, I get it.

1:27:53.924 --> 1:27:58.329
Your pathetic, sleazy,
delusional ass took control

1:27:58.362 --> 1:28:01.731
by drugging Ced to get his dick.

1:28:01.766 --> 1:28:04.835
Miss oh, I can get any
man that I want.

1:28:04.869 --> 1:28:05.602
Bitch!

1:28:05.635 --> 1:28:07.772
I can get any man that I want

1:28:07.805 --> 1:28:09.373
by any means necessary.

1:28:09.407 --> 1:28:11.142
Is that all you
desire out of life?

1:28:11.175 --> 1:28:13.576
Dick after dick after dick?

1:28:13.610 --> 1:28:16.947
No substance, just one
big dick party?

1:28:17.815 --> 1:28:20.084
This is my lineage.

1:28:20.117 --> 1:28:21.551
This is my heritage.

1:28:22.253 --> 1:28:24.021
The Addisons are bosses.

1:28:24.922 --> 1:28:27.590
I'm a boss and I get
what I want.

1:28:27.624 --> 1:28:29.460
Yeah, y'all were
bosses all right.

1:28:29.493 --> 1:28:30.660
Your mama's a murderer,

1:28:30.693 --> 1:28:36.033
your daddy's a coke head
and now you, the rapist.

1:28:36.067 --> 1:28:38.102
Hmm, what a family tree.

1:28:38.135 --> 1:28:39.403
Dear diary.

1:28:39.437 --> 1:28:41.638
My life is a mess.

1:28:41.671 --> 1:28:44.809
Rihanna's mad at me,
Kelly hates me,

1:28:44.842 --> 1:28:46.877
Queen doesn't believe in me

1:28:46.911 --> 1:28:49.380
and Cedric, I know
I'm gonna have

1:28:49.413 --> 1:28:51.048
to pay for what I did to him.

1:29:00.791 --> 1:29:03.726
It's time to put an
end to the Queen's reign.

1:29:03.761 --> 1:29:05.096
And how we're gonna do that,

1:29:05.129 --> 1:29:08.332
we gotta get rid of all
her subjects,

1:29:08.365 --> 1:29:10.600
including the princess.

1:29:10.633 --> 1:29:13.170
Kelly, I need for you
to have Chloe

1:29:13.204 --> 1:29:14.737
by the shop by 9 o'clock.

1:29:14.772 --> 1:29:16.273
How am I supposed to do that?

1:29:16.307 --> 1:29:17.174
Chloe and I don't talk,

1:29:17.208 --> 1:29:19.143
she'll be suspicious.

1:29:19.176 --> 1:29:21.445
Use Rihanna as the bait.

1:29:21.479 --> 1:29:23.247
I'm gonna subdue D.A.,

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.149
and Trina, I need for you to do

1:29:25.182 --> 1:29:26.283
what you do best.

1:29:26.317 --> 1:29:28.119
I need for you to protect us.

1:29:30.254 --> 1:29:31.122
Bet.

1:29:31.922 --> 1:29:34.291
But, sis, you gotta tell me.

1:29:34.325 --> 1:29:35.793
How'd you make that happen?

1:29:38.329 --> 1:29:39.763
We'll talk about that later.

1:29:40.663 --> 1:29:43.167
Kelly, let's get this
party started.

1:29:50.941 --> 1:29:53.043
It's time for you to
make that call.

1:29:57.948 --> 1:29:59.884
Can I at least do
my hair first?

1:30:16.967 --> 1:30:18.602
I'm a let you out right here.

1:30:18.636 --> 1:30:19.803
Make sure y'all go
through the back.

1:30:19.837 --> 1:30:21.272
We gonna get these motherfuckers

1:30:22.406 --> 1:30:24.975
and I'm a handle them at
the shop, okay?

1:30:25.009 --> 1:30:25.876
Bet.

1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:45.229
Hey, so how can I
help you today?

1:30:45.262 --> 1:30:46.964
I'm here to see D.A.

1:30:46.997 --> 1:30:47.765
Who?

1:30:47.798 --> 1:30:48.766
Don't act crazy.

1:30:48.799 --> 1:30:51.202
I said I'm here to see D.A.

1:31:03.681 --> 1:31:05.549
Hey, big daddy.

1:31:05.583 --> 1:31:07.818
Woman, what are
you doing here?

1:31:07.851 --> 1:31:10.020
And how'd you know I was here?

1:31:10.054 --> 1:31:12.722
D.A., you my man, you know
I know everything about you.

1:31:13.924 --> 1:31:17.494
Look, I don't know what
type of games you're playing,

1:31:17.528 --> 1:31:18.362
but you need to go.

1:31:18.395 --> 1:31:20.164
You know what? Fine.

1:31:21.298 --> 1:31:21.932
But before I go,

1:31:21.966 --> 1:31:23.300
I got a little gift for you.

1:31:23.334 --> 1:31:24.734
It's real special.

1:31:31.875 --> 1:31:37.081
What the fuck?

1:31:43.187 --> 1:31:44.888
Hey, I'm a check
things out first.

1:31:44.922 --> 1:31:46.023
Y'all stay here till I get back,
aight?

1:31:46.056 --> 1:31:47.224
All right.

1:31:54.365 --> 1:31:55.966
Now you know the rule.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.469
Don't pull that out if
you ain't gonna use it.

1:31:58.502 --> 1:31:59.670
Are you ready?

1:31:59.703 --> 1:32:00.938
Like are you sure you ready

1:32:00.971 --> 1:32:02.273
to go in here and do this.

1:32:02.306 --> 1:32:03.540
Dammit Q'Wan.

1:32:03.574 --> 1:32:06.043
If I wasn't ready, I
wouldn't be here.

1:32:06.076 --> 1:32:08.045
That bitch has my best
friend hostage.

1:32:09.146 --> 1:32:12.016
All I know is if one hair
on her head is harmed,

1:32:12.049 --> 1:32:14.151
I'm capping everybody ass.

1:32:14.184 --> 1:32:16.120
Well, you make damn
sure you do.

1:32:18.689 --> 1:32:20.724
What's this all about anyway.

1:32:20.759 --> 1:32:22.559
Nina has her hostage?

1:32:22.593 --> 1:32:24.295
What the fuck for?

1:32:24.328 --> 1:32:25.429
Look, I don't know,

1:32:26.497 --> 1:32:28.332
but I know that she
does have her.

1:32:28.365 --> 1:32:30.968
And I heard them shoot
somebody in the background.

1:32:51.155 --> 1:32:52.723
All right, check this out.

1:32:52.757 --> 1:32:53.957
They got one lookout,

1:32:53.991 --> 1:32:55.726
but I heard people talkin'

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.294
like someone's gettin'
beat in there.

1:32:57.328 --> 1:32:59.997
We gotta go now, all right,
let's go.

1:33:19.983 --> 1:33:21.051
Oh, shit, Ri.

1:33:24.823 --> 1:33:25.856
Oh, my God, Chloe.

1:33:25.889 --> 1:33:27.491
Kelly and Miss Nina
are trippin'.

1:33:27.524 --> 1:33:30.928
They have your mom and
dad tied up in the back.

1:33:35.966 --> 1:33:37.534
You know you
motherfuckers are dead

1:33:37.568 --> 1:33:38.736
when this is over with.

1:33:38.770 --> 1:33:41.205
I can't wait to see
y'all bitch ass suffer.

1:33:41.238 --> 1:33:42.940
You know, shut the fuck up.

1:33:42.973 --> 1:33:45.342
Shit.

1:33:45.376 --> 1:33:46.910
I can't see.

1:33:48.479 --> 1:33:51.915
I'm a kill you, I'm a
kill you bitch ass niggas.

1:33:54.118 --> 1:33:55.787
You won't be alive after tonight

1:33:55.820 --> 1:33:57.421
to do anything honey.

1:33:57.454 --> 1:33:59.758
Your reign is over bitch.

1:33:59.791 --> 1:34:01.024
I'm a kill you motherfucker.

1:34:01.058 --> 1:34:03.460
Wait a minute,
y'all hear that.

1:34:03.494 --> 1:34:05.429
Trina, go check it out.

1:34:08.932 --> 1:34:10.667
That girl from your
graduation party

1:34:10.701 --> 1:34:12.002
that we had that fight with?

1:34:12.035 --> 1:34:13.203
That's Kelly's girlfriend.

1:34:13.237 --> 1:34:15.038
What? Kelly's girlfriend?

1:34:15.072 --> 1:34:16.173
Yeah, Kelly and Miss Nina

1:34:16.206 --> 1:34:17.842
are the ones that
brought me here

1:34:17.876 --> 1:34:18.709
and they're in the back

1:34:18.742 --> 1:34:19.643
with your mom and dad.

1:34:20.879 --> 1:34:22.646
Chloe, get Rihanna,
y'all get outta here.

1:34:22.679 --> 1:34:24.481
We'll take over this.

1:34:30.855 --> 1:34:32.189
Q'Wan!

1:34:33.357 --> 1:34:36.326
Chloe, get him outta here,
get him to the car now.

1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:37.227
Come on.

1:34:47.137 --> 1:34:50.207
Well, well, well, I
should have known

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:51.942
the princess wouldn't
have left home

1:34:51.975 --> 1:34:53.610
without big strong bodyguard.

1:34:53.644 --> 1:34:54.645
Kelly, Kelly.

1:34:54.678 --> 1:34:55.646
Where's Queen?

1:34:55.679 --> 1:34:56.947
No, where's Queen, where's D.A.?

1:34:56.980 --> 1:34:59.049
Relax, I wanted to know

1:34:59.082 --> 1:35:00.584
what it'd be like to touch you.

1:35:00.617 --> 1:35:01.585
Get your damn hands off-

1:35:04.021 --> 1:35:05.055
Shit, I gotta go save him.

1:35:05.088 --> 1:35:07.357
Chloe, no, he can take
care of himself.

1:35:07.391 --> 1:35:09.894
Let's get out of here
and go get help.

1:35:09.928 --> 1:35:11.863
No, I gotta go save Queen.

1:35:11.896 --> 1:35:13.697
Get Q'Wan to the car.

1:35:13.730 --> 1:35:14.631
Okay, be careful.

1:35:14.665 --> 1:35:17.201
Come on, Q'Wan, you got this.

1:35:19.838 --> 1:35:20.839
Ah!

1:35:20.872 --> 1:35:22.172
Oh, you're in pain?

1:35:22.907 --> 1:35:24.274
I should just end it.

1:35:25.275 --> 1:35:28.011
Don't be so scared now.

1:35:28.045 --> 1:35:30.280
Oh, Chloe, Chloe, she
doesn't have

1:35:30.314 --> 1:35:33.183
her big bodyguard, Pizazz.

1:35:33.217 --> 1:35:35.719
What fucking kind of
name is Pizazz?

1:35:35.752 --> 1:35:38.489
Fucking rock looking
motherfucker.

1:35:38.522 --> 1:35:40.090
Ah, ah!

1:35:42.593 --> 1:35:44.261
And you shot my girl.

1:35:46.865 --> 1:35:47.998
You shot my girl.

1:35:48.031 --> 1:35:51.101
I should just end your
motherfuckin' life.

1:35:52.503 --> 1:35:54.137
Where's the bitch at.

1:35:54.171 --> 1:35:56.406
Do it, 'cause I ain't
telling you shit.

1:35:58.375 --> 1:36:00.744
Oh! Ah!

1:36:00.778 --> 1:36:03.580
Next time, it
won't be so nice.

1:36:03.614 --> 1:36:05.884
It's gonna go through
your motherfuckin' head.

1:36:05.917 --> 1:36:07.651
So I'm a ask you again,

1:36:07.684 --> 1:36:10.320
where is the bitch at?

1:36:12.356 --> 1:36:13.223
Shit!

1:36:18.061 --> 1:36:19.329
Big P, you okay?

1:36:19.363 --> 1:36:21.231
I can't go on, I can't do it.

1:36:22.366 --> 1:36:23.233
Go get help.

1:36:23.267 --> 1:36:23.868
No.

1:36:23.902 --> 1:36:24.769
I'm gonna handle this.

1:36:24.802 --> 1:36:26.004
I'm gonna go take care of my mom

1:36:26.036 --> 1:36:28.405
and make sure someone
comes back for you, okay?

1:36:28.438 --> 1:36:29.306
Oh!

1:36:31.308 --> 1:36:32.175
Ah!

1:36:40.050 --> 1:36:41.084
And all this time you thought

1:36:41.118 --> 1:36:43.253
he was being faithful
to you.

1:36:47.724 --> 1:36:51.796
Now you know Queen how
weak men are for pussy.

1:36:54.032 --> 1:36:55.265
You know that, right?

1:36:56.166 --> 1:36:59.703
Especially how weak he
is for my pussy.

1:37:04.107 --> 1:37:08.512
Matter of fact, I'm a
show you exactly how weak

1:37:08.545 --> 1:37:09.513
he is for my pussy.

1:37:14.251 --> 1:37:16.186
- You see this.
- Nina, don't do it.

1:37:16.219 --> 1:37:19.356
Now, I want you to take
a real hard look at this.

1:37:19.389 --> 1:37:23.694
You see that name,
Darrell Addison, Jr.

1:37:24.862 --> 1:37:27.364
And my name, Nina Hancock.

1:37:28.699 --> 1:37:29.867
Yeah, that's right.

1:37:31.002 --> 1:37:32.904
You see, our family has
been intertwined

1:37:32.937 --> 1:37:34.638
for a long time now.

1:37:34.671 --> 1:37:39.109
It's a damn shame what
happened to your brother.

1:37:40.110 --> 1:37:41.012
Don't touch me.

1:37:41.045 --> 1:37:44.214
But anyway, back to business.

1:37:48.418 --> 1:37:50.454
Did you see the father's name?

1:37:50.487 --> 1:37:52.689
Darrell Addison.

1:37:53.423 --> 1:37:55.492
Oh, our son, he's so adorable.

1:37:56.259 --> 1:37:57.394
It's just too bad you won't get

1:37:57.427 --> 1:37:59.496
the chance to see him grow up.

1:37:59.529 --> 1:38:02.699
And he looks just like
his brother and sister.

1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:06.104
I'm a beat your ass,
Nina.

1:38:06.136 --> 1:38:09.439
You know what, shut
the fuck up, D.A.

1:38:09.473 --> 1:38:11.375
You don't love this bitch.

1:38:14.144 --> 1:38:15.379
You know what, Queen.

1:38:16.446 --> 1:38:17.782
I got one more gift for you.

1:38:17.815 --> 1:38:19.917
I don't want shit from yo ass.

1:38:21.385 --> 1:38:23.054
This one's special.

1:38:23.087 --> 1:38:24.221
You gonna love it.

1:38:25.089 --> 1:38:26.523
You know what?

1:38:26.556 --> 1:38:29.027
Before I blow your
motherfuckin' brains out,

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:31.328
I'm a give you one last gift.

1:38:33.798 --> 1:38:35.499
Yeah, well, fuck you.

1:38:35.532 --> 1:38:36.868
Fuck you and that
bastard ass child.

1:38:36.901 --> 1:38:38.936
I can't wait to slice
his motherfuckin' throat.

1:38:38.970 --> 1:38:41.139
Oh, you gonna talk
about my son?

1:38:41.171 --> 1:38:42.606
Bitch!

1:38:42.639 --> 1:38:44.241
Aw, you done spit.

1:38:50.982 --> 1:38:52.950
You always talkin' shit,

1:38:54.217 --> 1:38:56.087
but since you talkin' shit,

1:38:56.120 --> 1:38:58.488
I'm a make your ass eat shit,
bitch.

1:39:00.323 --> 1:39:01.793
Open up your damn mouth.

1:39:03.226 --> 1:39:04.695
I said open up your mouth.

1:39:04.728 --> 1:39:06.730
You see this, open up
your mouth, bitch

1:39:06.764 --> 1:39:07.832
and eat this shit.

1:39:07.865 --> 1:39:09.700
Yeah, eat it all.

1:39:20.610 --> 1:39:24.949
You gonna wake up and
do something for her?

1:39:24.982 --> 1:39:25.850
Nina.

1:39:26.818 --> 1:39:30.021
Don't do this.

1:39:30.054 --> 1:39:31.823
Isn't this where
you wanted it?

1:39:31.856 --> 1:39:34.224
Put the fuckin' gun down.

1:39:37.561 --> 1:39:38.562
Ah.

1:39:38.595 --> 1:39:40.430
Baby girl to the rescue, huh?

1:39:41.531 --> 1:39:43.101
Why don't you put your gun down

1:39:43.134 --> 1:39:45.702
and fight me like a real woman.

1:39:57.547 --> 1:39:59.917
Bitch, save your mama ass.

1:39:59.951 --> 1:40:01.953
Get her Chloe!

1:40:01.986 --> 1:40:03.154

1:40:03.187 --> 1:40:05.123

1:40:05.156 --> 1:40:06.758

1:40:07.992 --> 1:40:09.326

1:40:42.659 --> 1:40:44.162

1:40:44.195 --> 1:40:45.395
Baby girl.

1:40:46.663 --> 1:40:49.100
I can't believe this

1:40:49.133 --> 1:40:51.135
Baby girl.

1:40:51.169 --> 1:40:53.971

1:40:54.005 --> 1:40:55.505

1:41:10.087 --> 1:41:10.922
Shoot him.

1:41:10.955 --> 1:41:11.889

1:41:11.923 --> 1:41:13.024
That bitch is lyin', Queen.

1:41:13.057 --> 1:41:15.625

1:41:15.659 --> 1:41:17.327
Chloe, don't do it.

1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:18.296
Chloe, don't do it.

1:41:18.328 --> 1:41:20.832
Baby girl, don't do it.

1:41:20.865 --> 1:41:22.332
Baby, don't do it.

1:41:22.365 --> 1:41:24.135
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1:41:24.168 --> 1:41:25.002
No.

1:41:30.775 --> 1:41:31.641
Mama.

1:41:32.709 --> 1:41:33.577
Oh, shit.

1:41:36.746 --> 1:41:37.714
Are you okay?

1:41:42.419 --> 1:41:44.754
Man, I'm happy to see you.

1:41:45.655 --> 1:41:46.523
Queen.

1:41:48.993 --> 1:41:50.061
Is she ready?

1:41:51.762 --> 1:41:52.696
Oh, yeah.

1:41:53.697 --> 1:41:54.332
