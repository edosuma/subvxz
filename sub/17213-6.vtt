WEBVTT

00:16.767 --> 00:18.351
Amen!

00:19.352 --> 00:20.896
Amen!

00:20.979 --> 00:24.274
Moses went to the mountain
for 40 days and nights.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.485
Jesus wandered
into the desert for 40 days,

00:27.570 --> 00:32.240
and so, too, have we journeyed
across this land,

00:32.324 --> 00:35.410
back to the place where I first had
the vision of our coming rapture.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.954
- Hallelujah!
- Praise be.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.413
It was at the shores of this river

00:38.496 --> 00:41.499
that you were first baptized
into my flock.

00:41.584 --> 00:42.918
Amen.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.128
My friends...

00:46.296 --> 00:48.548
it is time.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.883
Hallelujah.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.472
The Lord awaits us!

01:42.645 --> 01:43.729
Did we all make it?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.438
Good question.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.484
Anybody here feeling out of place?

01:50.736 --> 01:52.946
Feeling not too bad.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.447
Gang's all here.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.660
Well, hallelujah.
That's gotta be a record.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.412
All right, Earl.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.291
Let's get everybody back on the bus.
We got a long drive down the coast.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.900
Nurse said you woke up at 0300.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.235
Tried to pull out your ventilator tube.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.322
They called me in to reprimand you.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.907
Yes, sir.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.910
Sorry, I was a little out of it.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.122
Anyone told you you've been unconscious
for a number of weeks?

02:44.206 --> 02:45.666
Yeah, it's hard to believe.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.501
Feels like I was
in the driver's seat of that truck

02:48.585 --> 02:51.714
and then... I was here.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.133
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.929
To be honest, sir, you...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.389
you probably saw
more of what happened than I did.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.433
How's that?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.020
You were following behind me,
like you said.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.272
I spotted your headlights at one point.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.943
I was mostly focused on...

03:13.026 --> 03:15.946
keeping the vibrations down
and the road ahead.

03:18.741 --> 03:21.576
And then the car came out of nowhere,
and that... that woman walked out.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.829
-What woman?
-You didn't see her?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.539
I radioed you
before I stopped the truck.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.167
She was just standing
in the middle of the road.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.627
I told her she didn't want to be there,

03:32.004 --> 03:35.132
and then the next thing I remember,
I was driving again.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.676
Sir, I know it sounds crazy, but--

03:38.761 --> 03:42.014
All right.
That's enough for now.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.599
I'm sure it'll all come back
to you in time.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.186
Get some rest.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.398
Sir, I know what was
in the back of my truck.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.359
How am I still alive?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.155
I'm gonna go find out.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.438
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:32.730 --> 04:36.944
Someone tried to shabby-chic
a classic barley twist.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.029
The client wants me to restore it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.405
Brought you the last of the coffee.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.450
Oh, I... I left that for you
for your traveler's mug.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.785
My what?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.744
You know, that insulated mug

04:46.829 --> 04:49.331
your dad used to wander
around the house with?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.083
Oh... uh, no.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.668
I've had my caffeine ration for the day.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.839
I was thinking about doing fish
on the grill tonight.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.841
Don't count on me for dinner.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.342
Oh...

05:00.425 --> 05:03.053
I was hoping since you've been
working so much these past few weeks--

05:03.136 --> 05:04.972
I can't. Not tonight.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.100
All right.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.564
So that's a classic barley twist, huh?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.108
Mmm.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.610
Imagine someone treating it like that...

05:18.693 --> 05:20.028
not knowing what they have.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.990
It's impressive what you do.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.034
And why do you think that is, Grant?

05:26.118 --> 05:29.079
You take something neglected, and...

05:30.288 --> 05:33.834
something that's rare and beautiful,
make it whole again.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.296
Oh... thank you.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.593
I told Forbes I'd be early.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.764
Bye, Kat.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.975
Bye.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.647
Patricia?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.986
Oh, no, no. That's not what you said
you were gonna wear.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.154
Well, I've changed my mind!

06:02.237 --> 06:04.031
No, you know I like you
in that black dress.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.034
All right.
Would you mind? Thank you.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.077
You know, my humanities teacher,
Mr. Warchowski,

06:09.161 --> 06:10.245
says that in 20 years,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.497
equality between the sexes
won't even be an issue.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.207
Warchowski's the gay one, isn't he?

06:14.291 --> 06:15.833
Not an issue.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.585
No parties while I'm gone,
okay, superstar?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.212
-I promise.
-I'm serious.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.798
I can tell.
You have a good time, Gary.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.966
I'll be in the car.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.885
Stop calling me "Gary,"
for Christ's sake, I'm your father.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.104
You looked lovely
in that other dress, by the way.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.190
Oh, it's just easier, honey.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.442
We've gotta teach him some time.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.652
Yeah, thank you.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.322
Okay, so we are gonna be
home by noon tomorrow.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.449
Bye, Mom.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.957
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Here you go.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.250
Bye.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.343
- All set?
- Yep.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.595
What's wrong?
Is everything all right?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.763
Yeah, you know. Parents.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.396
Prevent Helios and we prevent
the beginning of the fall.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.692
That was the director's calculation
that started this whole thing.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.820
More than any other,
this is the mission objective

07:25.903 --> 07:28.490
that motivated us
to come back to the 21st.

07:29.407 --> 07:34.204
I know you all just went through hell,
and I wish we had answers, but we don't.

07:35.205 --> 07:39.167
So let's just focus
on the mission at hand.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.460
Marcy?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.006
All right. Uh...

07:44.089 --> 07:47.217
Place the business end
against your bicep like so, and push.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.428
It's important that you receive
the full dosage, okay?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.390
You'll still smell and taste the chemical
in the air within the compound,

07:53.473 --> 07:56.518
but I promise you, this will stop
your nervous system from shutting down.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.894
Okay?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.651
What?
Nervous about a little pinprick

08:04.734 --> 08:06.694
after what we've just
been through?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.030
I just have a thing with needles.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.032
Funny. Me, too.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.994
Speaking of which,
this isn't gonna interfere with, uh--

08:14.077 --> 08:15.870
No, you're fine.
You can go ahead.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.540
Our abductors set back his rehab.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.874
Ah.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.794
One last thing.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.131
It was our decision to take
the antimatter back to Delaney.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.883
It's on us that the location
for this mission had to change,

08:28.966 --> 08:31.969
so one way or the other,
we are seeing this through.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.389
To the end, if necessary.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.640
We know.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.434
And we're good.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.686
Yes, you are.

08:42.939 --> 08:43.940
If I may?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.490
We, the last unbroken remnants...

08:52.574 --> 08:56.119
Vow to undo the errors
of our ascendants,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.537
to make the Earth whole,

08:57.620 --> 09:00.248
the lost unlost,

09:00.332 --> 09:02.875
at peril of our own birth.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.174
Okay.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.552
That's time.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.640
Could I take this in my glutes,
or does it have to be my arm?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.642
Not a lot of muscle to work with.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.687
Just stick to the instructions, Becky.
You're our best sniper.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.739
Good to go.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.490
Dr. Delaney?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.409
That was fast.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.411
I need you
to come with us, ma'am.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.037
Come with you?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.123
That I wasn't expecting.
Where are we going?

10:23.206 --> 10:24.624
I'm afraid I can't say.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.750
No.

10:25.833 --> 10:26.876
No?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.462
Look it up. It means "no."

10:32.424 --> 10:35.051
Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm not authorized
to take no for an answer.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.803
Oh, for God's sake,
I'm just screwing with you.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.054
Let's go.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.891
Stay here.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.518
The major doesn't want
anyone to have access

10:43.601 --> 10:45.562
-without his knowledge.
-Yes, sir.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.364
Look at all the trees.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.825
Can you imagine
ever seeing so many trees?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.785
I've seen maybe 100 birds.

11:00.868 --> 11:04.121
Oh! There's another one
of those Canada geese!

11:04.206 --> 11:06.416
Keep your eyes on the road.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.919
All my eyes are looking for
is a rest stop.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.589
Oh, we're on a tight schedule.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.091
Yeah, tell my bladder.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.363
These are your guys?
I thought...

11:36.446 --> 11:39.366
Oh, by all means,
complete that sentence.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.783
Who were you expecting?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.119
-Take me back to my lab, please.
-But you just got here.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.621
Then I wanna talk to my lawyer.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.749
Dr. Delaney, you're a military contractor
operating under military law

11:47.832 --> 11:49.709
during a time of contingency operations.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.712
I am a scientist and my contract is with
the Van Huizen Corporation.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.298
Consequently, you fall under
the code of military conduct,

11:55.382 --> 11:56.966
and will be held for questioning.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.426
Sergeant?

11:58.510 --> 12:01.346
I'll need to take this for now, ma'am.
Follow me, please.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.403
Don't know why you'd be nervous.
You're in your element.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.281
I'm just thinking about Jeffrey...

12:19.364 --> 12:21.157
about not being able to protect him.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.910
I never expected to get so attached.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.121
You can't think like that.
You gotta stay in the present.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.581
Irony intended.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.082
What about your wife?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.169
Does it bother you
that you may never see her again?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.254
That's not really the present, is it?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
That's not really an answer.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.698
Mrs. Bloom?
Are you ready?

13:03.366 --> 13:06.911
Now, legally, we need to present
this material before we proceed.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.458
I didn't walk in here by mistake.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.002
I'll be right back with your medicine.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.631
Could I have some chocolate, please?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.343
I hear the liquid's bitter.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.469
Of course.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.324
Is everything okay?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.704
I changed my mind.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.051
Hi. Remember me?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.638
Another leak in 26, apparently.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.098
I don't see that here.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.684
What? They called, like, 40 minutes ago.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.102
Said it was worse than last time.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.146
I brought the whole crew out
on a Saturday.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.523
Mind if I have a look at that?

14:58.606 --> 15:01.358
The notification would show up
right here if you had one.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.403
Can I get some help here?
A little help!

15:03.486 --> 15:05.780
Officer,
your security guard passed out.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.949
I know CPR.
Get him on the ground.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.868
He just clutched his chest
and his knees buckled.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.663
I hope he's not having a heart attack.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.877
All right.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.216
- Just put 'em in the back.
- Three down.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.635
Police and military radio signals
are jammed outside the facility.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.846
- Wind direction?
- Same as historical record.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.972
Okay, you guys to the charges.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.974
We'll find Delaney,
give her the antitoxin,

15:33.057 --> 15:36.018
and explain what's going on.
That ought to be interesting.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.646
Your reinforcements have been delayed.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.190
Bus got stopped at the border.
Expired passport.

15:41.273 --> 15:44.026
Well, no plan survives contact
with the past, right?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.659
3546 in position.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.217
Dr. Delaney?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.138
Hello?

16:14.265 --> 16:15.767
I mean, it is the weekend.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.852
Well, she said she'd be here.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.772
Does it matter?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.607
We don't need her, but I...

16:24.400 --> 16:26.861
No, she's not answering her cell.
It just keeps ringing.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.032
- <i>We're in position.</i>
- All right.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.116
Go when ready.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.242
Copy.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.203
- Hope the wind doesn't change!
- It won't for hours.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.747
According to the historical record,
it won't,

16:37.830 --> 16:40.875
but you said it yourself,
we're starting to see changes.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.002
These tanks will be ruptured
by the blast anyway,

16:43.085 --> 16:45.588
and the toxic cloud
would be blown toward the city.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.883
A controlled release allows
for a forced evacuation.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.134
Hands in the air!

16:50.217 --> 16:51.343
Move!

16:55.389 --> 16:56.641
Move!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.100
This is Morrison. Come in.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.602
Your radio won't work.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.522
On your knees,
with your hands on your head!

17:02.605 --> 17:04.065
Listen! You need to run!
Now! That way!

17:04.148 --> 17:06.651
I said, on your knees,
with your hands on your head!

17:06.734 --> 17:09.361
Now! I repeat, this is Morrison.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.447
And I repeat, your radio will not work.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.532
Five seconds.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.366
Please, kid! Run!

17:14.450 --> 17:15.910
You need to run!
Go! Go!

17:15.993 --> 17:17.119
Shut up!

17:17.203 --> 17:19.121
Hands on your head!
Last warning!

17:22.333 --> 17:23.876
I'm so sorry.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.609
-He's not a Van Huizen employee.
-No, he's not.

17:48.818 --> 17:52.321
Boss, we initiated the controlled release.
The alarm should go any second now.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.198
I regret to report one casualty.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.327
<i>Understood.</i>
<i>I need you back in building 26 now.</i>

17:58.410 --> 17:59.536
We got another problem.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.456
<i>Attention,</i>
<i>this is an air quality alert.</i>

18:02.539 --> 18:06.753
<i>All personnel evacuate immediately</i>
<i>or report to your designated refuge area.</i>

18:08.755 --> 18:10.715
Keep moving!
Come on, let's go!

18:10.798 --> 18:14.218
Okay! Keep moving! Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!

18:14.301 --> 18:15.803
<i>...all personnel</i>
<i>evacuate immediately</i>

18:15.887 --> 18:17.346
<i>or report to your designated refuge area.</i>

18:17.429 --> 18:20.266
Keep the change, Omar,
and head east as fast as you can.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.936
You're late, ma'am.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.939
Did you know that older people
have a hard time getting cabs in the city

18:27.023 --> 18:28.650
because apparently we tip like shit?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.568
My new friend taught me that.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.905
Ow!

18:33.988 --> 18:36.908
<i>Attention,</i>
<i>this is an air quality alert.</i>

18:36.991 --> 18:37.992
<i>All personnel...</i>

18:38.075 --> 18:39.451
Traveler 3277.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.078
Park the vehicles near the leak

18:41.162 --> 18:44.290
in case a television crew
is stupid enough to try to get a shot.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.458
-Then get up on the roof. It's on the way.
-Okay, got it.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.461
-The device hasn't arrived yet?
-Oh, it's ten minutes out.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.924
Well, then, I'm not late yet, am I?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.303
How far of a walk is it?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.472
Can we get the engineer transport?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.434
Walk with me, if we've got the time.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.894
I need the exercise.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.361
It is a very simple question, Doctor.
What happened to the antimatter?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.656
-If this is an interrogation fantasy--
-Hardly.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.116
Or worse, your way of getting me
to confess that I failed again.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.242
This is what it is.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.244
You can expect charges of mutiny,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.205
sedition, aiding the enemy,
and espionage,

19:24.288 --> 19:25.915
and each one
carries the death penalty.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.834
I already told you what happened.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.543
The antimatter we actually created

19:29.626 --> 19:31.337
only amounted to a fraction
of what we thought.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.715
-I think you sold it!
-What? To who?

19:33.798 --> 19:36.217
Russians. North Korea.
Any number of foreign powers.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.886
Wow. You're right.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.263
And it didn't even take you long
to figure out.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.851
First, I snuck the material
out in my purse.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.687
I didn't say I knew how you did it.
I just know you did it.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.983
Major Gleason, I didn't know
how big an idiot you were.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.777
I just knew you were an idiot.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.752
She put a biometric lock on the material.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.544
Retinal scan. Delaney's.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.797
- That's a tough hack.
- I guess she didn't trust us.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.673
No, I told her to keep it safe, but...

20:16.758 --> 20:18.675
not safe from us.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.053
Texted her a heads-up yesterday
and this morning.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.138
Can't reach her.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
You think she's been taken somewhere
against her will?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.682
That's been goin' around.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.601
That casualty that I reported
a few minutes ago

20:27.684 --> 20:29.353
wasn't a Van Huizen employee.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.231
Wasn't in uniform,
but I'm pretty sure he was military.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.565
I'll look for her.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.567
I'll try and break this lock.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.869
I'm Traveler 117.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.789
The director says hello.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.207
Welcome to the 21st, engineer.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.459
Call me Bloom.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.461
It's wonderful to see you again.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.214
Ah... you too, kid.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.806
How are you coping
with your situation, dear?

21:04.889 --> 21:06.473
Oh, I'm fine, thank you, ma'am.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.225
Uh, it is an honor to meet you in person.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.895
Oh, please. The honor's mine.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.899
You do know you guys are already famous
where I just came from?

21:14.982 --> 21:15.983
Really?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.234
Not in a good way.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.903
Oh.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.823
There's been a lot of arguments
among the project team over you.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.241
I should know.
I've argued on both sides.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.535
Boy, they ever give you a hard time.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.497
Remind me not to ever
get on your bad side.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.042
Wait, you know
who abducted my team?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.877
Wasn't anyone on my team.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.337
They were tortured for days!

21:36.420 --> 21:38.380
I know what happened, dear.
I'm from the future.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.218
I'm sure it was terrible,
but the point is, you found them.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.595
Well, we found them.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.348
Not that that matters anymore, anyway.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.017
This is the big day. If this works...

21:51.393 --> 21:52.561
we're done.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.398
If this works, we save
tens of millions of lives.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.943
Sure we do.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.321
But you're forgetting the oath
you took before you came.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.408
"At peril of our own birth."

22:08.119 --> 22:09.578
The handsome boy gets it.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.250
Uh... I'm sorry, I don't.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.419
They're so cute when they're young.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.882
Everything up to now,
all these missions,

22:20.965 --> 22:25.052
they've been preparations,
fine-tuning for this moment.

22:25.136 --> 22:29.015
Not that the other work wasn't important
or didn't matter, but...

22:29.932 --> 22:33.394
If we successfully deflect
asteroid Helios 685,

22:33.477 --> 22:36.105
we alter the course of humanity
so profoundly,

22:36.188 --> 22:38.900
it's highly probable
that the time we come from,

22:38.983 --> 22:41.735
everything between then and now,

22:41.818 --> 22:44.155
the plagues, the shortages, the wars...

22:45.072 --> 22:46.615
none of that will happen.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.744
Which means it's also
highly probable that...

22:51.954 --> 22:52.997
neither will we.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.299
<i>...and are</i>
<i>evacuating outskirts of the city</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:06.635
<i>near the Van Huizen research facility</i>
<i>as a precaution.</i>

23:06.718 --> 23:09.346
<i>While close exposure is considered fatal,</i>

23:09.430 --> 23:12.516
<i>civic authorities are confident</i>
<i>the toxic chemical leak...</i>

23:12.599 --> 23:15.394
We shouldn't have stopped
to take a picture of that dog.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.939
It was a bear,
and it took all of 30 seconds.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.566
It was that damn border crossing.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.401
<i>...but as a precaution,</i>
<i>city residents...</i>

23:27.031 --> 23:28.740
This is Carly. The device has arrived,

23:28.824 --> 23:30.201
and it's being lowered into position.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.452
<i>How's the perimeter looking?</i>

23:31.535 --> 23:33.120
Non-traveler responders
keep showing up,

23:33.204 --> 23:34.621
and we keep telling them to leave.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.790
Sooner or later, someone's not
gonna take no for an answer.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.667
I could use those reinforcements.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.794
Well, just keep saying no, Carly.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.463
I don't know what else
to tell you.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.714
Copy.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.970
<i>Laser's here. I'm here.</i>

23:49.053 --> 23:51.555
All we need now is access
to the antimatter.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.890
And there's no way
to bypass this scan?

23:53.974 --> 23:55.351
Well, Philip's gonna run
a software hack,

23:55.434 --> 23:57.019
but Delaney did an excellent job.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.520
We may be stuck.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.108
-Imagine why you're famous.
-This isn't really a problem.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.651
With or without Delaney,
we can trigger containment failure

24:04.735 --> 24:06.362
by shutting off its power supply.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.530
Do it that way
and we risk an asymmetrical collapse

24:08.614 --> 24:09.615
of the magnetic bottle.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.035
Now, would you please stop improvising
for one damn minute?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.496
Power shut off has always been
the contingency.

24:15.579 --> 24:19.708
An X-ray laser works by translating
a very specific amount of energy

24:19.791 --> 24:23.962
from an antimatter or nuclear explosion
into a coherent beam of X-rays.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.714
Too much, and you overload the laser.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.799
Too little,
and it won't deflect the target.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.302
This is my swan song, MacLaren.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.720
I would like to get it right,

24:31.803 --> 24:33.889
and I would like to be
the one who turns the key.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.392
I do not care to wing this!

24:43.357 --> 24:45.151
How's your search going?

24:46.193 --> 24:48.362
I just found a car on security logs

24:48.445 --> 24:50.489
arriving at the facility
early this morning

24:50.572 --> 24:52.491
and leaving five minutes after.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.327
I can't identify the occupants,
but I do have a plate.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.371
Good. Locate that car.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.747
We've still got time to get her here.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.167
At least, find her eye.
That's all we really need.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.379
I'll be checking my science project
on the roof

25:05.462 --> 25:07.464
if anybody needs me.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.885
She's been like that for 100 years.
Don't take it personally.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.304
Yeah.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.642
Private Wilson
suffered third-degree burns

25:18.725 --> 25:20.311
over 20% of his body.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.854
He spent the last several weeks in a coma.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.274
Whoever intercepted his truck
made it look like containment failed,

25:25.357 --> 25:27.651
-and then there was an explosion.
-How did you let that happen?

25:27.734 --> 25:28.860
Where were you during all this?

25:28.944 --> 25:30.487
Wilson came out of his coma
in the middle of the night

25:30.571 --> 25:31.572
and I spoke to him.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.283
He told me a woman stopped him
in the middle of the road,

25:34.366 --> 25:35.867
"just standing there."

25:36.618 --> 25:39.996
Damn it.
You just keep getting it right.

25:40.081 --> 25:42.291
The second you left,
I took off in my invisible helicopter--

25:42.374 --> 25:43.792
This is not funny!

25:43.875 --> 25:46.295
If you actually
listen to yourself, it's hilarious!

25:46.378 --> 25:48.297
Your own piece-of-shit
portable containment unit

25:48.380 --> 25:49.423
weighed a couple tons,

25:49.506 --> 25:51.342
and needed a Mack truck to pull it around.
How the hell--

25:51.425 --> 25:53.885
There are plenty of foreign powers
capable of engineering this, Doctor!

25:53.969 --> 25:56.430
Why would I have waited
until you took it from me to sell it

25:56.513 --> 25:57.681
if I already had it?

25:57.765 --> 26:00.559
A few minutes ago, you were sticking
to your story that it never existed.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.904
Hey, David, it's me.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.991
Uh, guess it's my turn
to leave you a goofy message.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.495
Um... I just know how stressed out you get
when you don't hear from me,

26:19.578 --> 26:23.832
so I... wanted to let you know
that I might be away for a while,

26:23.915 --> 26:28.003
and maybe even... relocated.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.173
I just don't want you wondering
or worrying if you don't hear from me.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.550
You know, if it happens...

26:33.634 --> 26:36.470
I mean, I don't know for sure
if it will, but if it does...

26:37.346 --> 26:39.055
I just want to thank you...

26:39.140 --> 26:42.184
for always being there for me
when I really needed someone.

26:43.852 --> 26:48.232
You know, in another time
or another life, right?

26:49.483 --> 26:51.318
Okay, uh...

26:52.736 --> 26:54.112
Goodbye, David.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.539
I spent my life
designing that thing.

27:04.415 --> 27:07.083
Now, I'm just gonna blow it up.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.461
How's that for the circle of life?

27:12.005 --> 27:14.341
Oh! Are you feeling ill?

27:14.425 --> 27:16.968
My host was dying of cancer.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.513
Whatever pain medication she was on--

27:19.596 --> 27:20.681
I'll go grab you something.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.516
No, wait.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.312
Are you serious?

27:26.395 --> 27:28.355
One of the best pain meds there ever was.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.693
I mean, she's... she's not wrong.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.530
The firing window is 2 hours,
4 minutes, and 11 seconds away.

27:36.613 --> 27:40.701
All I gotta do is turn a key.
I'd rather not do it in pain.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.744
I'll check inside.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.045
Oh, I'm good.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.217
Trev?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.509
What happened?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.636
Progress?

28:00.679 --> 28:04.725
I think my hacking attempts
triggered a silent alarm.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.269
It's pinging to a remote IP.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.145
Can you ID the location?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.772
Hold that thought.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.065
Sir!

28:13.692 --> 28:15.444
It was in her bag.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.114
What is this?

28:21.408 --> 28:23.244
<i>What does this mean?</i>

28:23.327 --> 28:25.203
-Hello!
-I'll take Marcy.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.830
Send me the coordinates en route!

28:26.913 --> 28:28.540
<i>It means that your people are</i>
<i>in my lab</i>

28:28.624 --> 28:30.083
<i>trying to break into the containment unit.</i>

28:30.166 --> 28:31.710
<i>And they don't know</i>
<i>what the fuck they're doing.</i>

28:31.793 --> 28:34.838
The only guy I've got there
couldn't break into his own lunchbox.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.132
Tell me who that is!

28:40.886 --> 28:42.053
Where are you going?

28:42.137 --> 28:44.097
Philip found Delaney.
The engineer wants her here.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.933
-We can't hold them off much longer.
-We just need an hour or so.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.102
Give us a head start,
then blow the second charge.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.562
All right, go get her.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.316
- Trevor, blow the main.
<i>- Copy.</i>

28:58.779 --> 29:02.032
All right. Okay, this is
a deadly toxic gas, people.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.826
Get in your vehicles
and get out of here now!

29:05.786 --> 29:06.912
Go!

29:22.052 --> 29:24.555
You ever get the feeling
you're heading the wrong direction?

29:24.638 --> 29:26.556
Well, at least we can say we saw a dog.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.058
It was a bear!

29:30.269 --> 29:32.438
It was a beautiful living thing...

29:33.355 --> 29:35.316
out in the world.

29:37.318 --> 29:38.485
Excuse me, Major.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.155
There's a special agent
from the FBI who wants to talk.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.239
Tell him I'm busy.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.116
Not to you, sir. To her.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.173
Special Agent...

30:01.216 --> 30:02.759
MacLaren, FBI.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.720
-You're Major...
-Gleason.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.472
You must be
who triggered Delaney's alarm.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.057
Actually, the doctor's part
of an ongoing investigation

30:09.140 --> 30:10.684
that the bureau has had
underway for months,

30:10.767 --> 30:12.978
so you can imagine our surprise
when you show up out of nowhere

30:13.061 --> 30:14.730
and take her
to wherever the hell this is.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.814
This place--

30:15.897 --> 30:17.274
Obviously not
an official military facility,

30:17.358 --> 30:20.068
which is the only place
you'd have any sort of jurisdiction

30:20.151 --> 30:23.029
or the right to question anybody,
let alone Delaney.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.157
All right, so tell me.
Who's she selling to?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.909
Selling to?
What are you doing?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.870
-Major, this is not your job.
-I have good reason to suspect--

30:29.953 --> 30:32.414
It is, however, my job.
Do you understand that?

30:32.498 --> 30:35.125
You know what?
I've had enough of this conversation.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.711
Let me see her right now,
before I call your superiors

30:37.794 --> 30:42.173
and tell them you've been freelancing
as a private fucking detective.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.772
I give up. Where is she?

30:57.648 --> 30:59.566
Lock down the building.
Find her!

30:59.650 --> 31:01.443
Gleason, you gotta be kidding me!

31:01.527 --> 31:02.903
My men will find her!

31:02.986 --> 31:04.946
No! They will stand down
and stay out of this!

31:05.030 --> 31:06.948
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.075
Who knows what damage you've done?

31:11.036 --> 31:13.580
<i>I've released</i>
<i>all non-essential personnel.</i>

31:13.664 --> 31:14.915
<i>Where are my reinforcements?</i>

31:14.998 --> 31:16.041
Be there any minute.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.459
Can I get up now?

31:17.543 --> 31:20.754
What's going... Ow!

31:20.837 --> 31:22.172
What the hell is that?

31:22.255 --> 31:25.008
It's an antitoxin
for the chemical leak at Van Huizen.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.594
- What chemical leak?
- That's part of a longer conversation.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.471
You found my biometric lock.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.015
Uh-huh. And we're gonna need you
to unlock it.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.228
Finally.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.030
- You're late!
- Long drive.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.782
You know where you need to go?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.158
Restroom.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.786
Then, yeah,
we know what we're here to do.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.162
Let's go.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.837
<i>While</i>
<i>close exposure...</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:03.379
Sir, you should see this.

32:03.464 --> 32:06.091
<i>...civic authorities are confident</i>
<i>the toxic chemical leak</i>

32:06.174 --> 32:08.510
<i>will dissipate harmlessly</i>
<i>and soon be under control.</i>

32:08.594 --> 32:10.095
We haven't heard from Morrison?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.680
I can't reach him either.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.641
<i>...clearing the cloud away</i>
<i>from densely populated areas...</i>

32:14.725 --> 32:17.143
Can you guys be somewhere else
for a few minutes?

32:17.227 --> 32:19.605
You're fine. Go back to work.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.940
Oh, you son of a bitch.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.735
I need the squad fully armed
and ready to go right now.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.700
All right, leave two on that bus,
you stay down here.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.660
The rest of your squad over on that roof.

32:33.744 --> 32:34.828
Yours, over there.

32:34.911 --> 32:38.749
That'll place any attacking force
in a field of fire between you, okay?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.208
Protocol 3 hasn't been waived.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.668
They won't know about Protocol 3.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.044
They're gonna figure it out pretty quick.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.589
Let me worry about that.
Who's your best sniper?

32:45.672 --> 32:46.840
Uh, Becky.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.761
Becky... you're with me.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.710
What the fuck is that thing?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.838
That's also part of a longer conversation.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.467
Cutting it close.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.386
There's plenty of time.

33:34.555 --> 33:35.597
I wish.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.944
Me, too.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.533
Hi.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.951
Hello.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.621
<i>I heard you the first time!</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:00.706
No!

34:00.789 --> 34:02.708
For Christ's sake,
someone knock the woman out,

34:02.791 --> 34:04.876
point her eye at the damn thing,
and let's get on with it!

34:04.960 --> 34:05.961
And you are?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.254
The engineer who designed
that thing on your roof.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.215
-Call me Bloom.
-What is that thing?

34:11.257 --> 34:12.300
Tell her.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.844
It's an X-ray laser.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.846
And we're back to no.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.098
Look, travelers like ourselves

34:18.181 --> 34:20.601
have been building and assembling
components for this for over a year.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.102
To do what with it?

34:22.185 --> 34:25.897
There's an asteroid on a collision course
with Earth called Helios 685.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.440
It hasn't been detected yet,

34:27.523 --> 34:30.110
but when it strikes the Atlantic Ocean
in 18 months' time,

34:30.193 --> 34:32.904
the wave will knock out
most of the Eastern Seaboard,

34:32.988 --> 34:36.366
resulting in environmental effects,
shortages, and wars

34:36.449 --> 34:38.534
from which there will be no recovery.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.536
How the hell could you
possibly know all of this?

34:40.621 --> 34:43.707
- We're from the future.
- Just came from there myself.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.000
I don't recommend it.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.794
Why wasn't this asteroid detected?

34:47.878 --> 34:49.838
Helios will be detected
two months from now,

34:49.921 --> 34:51.381
but by then, it's too late.

34:51.464 --> 34:55.093
If my X-ray laser is fired
precisely 12 minutes from now,

34:55.176 --> 34:58.972
the beam will strike Helios
and deflect it by .07 degrees.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.725
Enough to miss the Earth in 18 months.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.227
A near-miss that will hopefully
bring the nations of the world together,

35:04.310 --> 35:06.605
make them realize
what the hell they've got to lose.

35:06.688 --> 35:07.814
You've seen the laser.

35:07.898 --> 35:11.151
You know damn well
the 21st century has nothing like it.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.031
To power it,
you need the energy release

35:16.114 --> 35:18.033
of a matter-antimatter detonation.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.245
The blast radius could be miles wide.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.790
People will die, yes.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.417
Certainly everyone here.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.630
But the laser will translate
most of that energy into the beam.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.509
Doctor, we would rather do this
with your help...

35:38.011 --> 35:39.763
but we are doing this.

35:45.060 --> 35:48.021
By all means, dear, take your time.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.779
They're coming.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.326
<i>Fire teams, stand by.</i>

36:01.409 --> 36:04.204
<i>A full squad just entered the compound.</i>

36:04.287 --> 36:06.081
We're close, Carly.
You need to hold them back.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.041
Hold who back?

36:08.124 --> 36:10.210
Gleason and his men.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.627
You're up, Doctor.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.344
Stand by.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.683
Now!

36:27.728 --> 36:30.105
- Take cover!
- Yes, Major! Copy that!

36:31.106 --> 36:33.024
You focus on the officer.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.943
Protocol 3 is in force.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.502
<i>Good day, Dr. Delaney.</i>

37:28.704 --> 37:30.706
They're not shooting to kill!

37:30.791 --> 37:32.083
Let's go, boys!
Take 'em down!

37:32.167 --> 37:33.251
Move, move, move!

37:35.962 --> 37:39.800
You should know I'm hardest on people
I think have the most potential.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.676
<i>Armed.</i>

37:41.760 --> 37:43.636
Okay, we're armed.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.889
Take Dr. Delaney with you.
The future could use her.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.808
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying till this is done.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.101
If you hadn't brought Delaney here,
I'd be forced to agree with you,

37:50.185 --> 37:51.937
but there's just time to get her
to minimum safe distance.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.064
The soldiers will eventually
make it inside.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.692
Then, there'll be no getting out of here
and it'll be in the hands of the director.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.903
Now do you get it?

38:28.556 --> 38:30.516
Request permission to use deadly force!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.727
Negative, we're coming out the south door.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.939
<i>Have your teams give cover fire</i>
<i>and meet us on the way.</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:39.317
Orders from the engineer.
We've gotta get Delaney to safe distance.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.653
Go, go, go!
Move it! Move it!

38:43.571 --> 38:44.990
I got the door!

38:47.742 --> 38:48.869
Go, go, go, go!

39:32.703 --> 39:35.874
It's medicinal... I swear.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.130
Cover fire, now!

39:50.846 --> 39:53.058
Carly, come on!

39:54.267 --> 39:55.810
Everybody, get down!

40:02.858 --> 40:03.902
Step away!

40:08.323 --> 40:10.491
I'd tell you to run...

40:10.575 --> 40:12.618
but with less than 87 seconds to go,

40:12.702 --> 40:14.787
-we're past that now.
-Stop!

40:14.870 --> 40:16.414
- I guess it's too much to ask...
- Stand down!

40:16.497 --> 40:18.666
...that I be the one
who turns the key when--

40:34.515 --> 40:36.851
Make sure she's dead.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.581
Stop!

40:58.664 --> 41:00.666
What are you doing? Soldier!

41:00.750 --> 41:02.835
Soldier, stop! That is an order!

41:25.483 --> 41:27.568
Stop! What are you doing?

41:27.652 --> 41:30.196
Soldier! Stand down! Stop, sir!

41:55.596 --> 41:56.722
Sergeant! No!

41:56.806 --> 41:58.808
Stand down!

42:26.336 --> 42:28.879
No. No!

42:51.736 --> 42:53.488
That's time.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.593
Eyes closed!

43:34.237 --> 43:36.489
How will we know if it worked?

43:38.824 --> 43:41.119
-I'm not sure it did.
-Why?

43:44.747 --> 43:46.999
Because we're all still here.
