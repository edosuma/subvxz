00:05.755 --> 00:07.090
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.132
- I have big news.
- Oh, you do?

00:08.216 --> 00:09.634
- Yes.
Um, sorry.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.302
I promised myself
I wouldn't tell you

00:11.386 --> 00:12.095
until I asked how
the funeral was.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.221
So, how was it?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.724
- Mmm, it was very sad.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.102
What?
- How's Matt?

00:19.185 --> 00:20.603
- He's all right.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.605
- You guys still together?

00:22.689 --> 00:24.315
- Yeah.
Yeah, and I think that

00:24.399 --> 00:27.610
that's right for now.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.280
- Good.
- What? Tell me.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.615
- David proposed.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.451
- Oh, my God!

00:34.534 --> 00:36.703
Oh!
I'm so happy for you.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.455
- Oh, here, I wanna
tell you everything.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.290
Come sit down.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.791
- What happened?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.419
- Um, okay.
- When did it happen?

00:44.502 --> 00:47.630
- Um, it happened the night
that you left for New York.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
- It did?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.092
- Well, you and Matt were
dealing with stuff, I--

00:51.176 --> 00:52.635
- I could have used
some good news.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.097
But start at the beginning.
Okay, where did it happen?

00:56.181 --> 00:58.475
- Uh, he asked me at his house.
- Did he get down on one knee?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.435
- Yeah, yeah, he got down on
one knee, but you gotta listen

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
to what I'm trying to tell you.
- Okay, okay, I'm listening.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.980
Okay, you're at his house,
he's down on one knee.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.816
And then what happened?
- And he asked me to marry him.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.694
- And?
- And I told him that I love him

01:09.778 --> 01:12.197
and he then told
me he loves me.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.490
- And?

01:13.573 --> 01:14.949
- And I told him
I don't know.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.159
- What?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.495
- Well, it just...
(sighs)

01:18.578 --> 01:20.663
When he asked me to come
over there, I came over

01:20.747 --> 01:21.831
'cause I thought
he was gonna tell me

01:21.915 --> 01:23.500
he wasn't interested
in me anymore.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.338
- So, the man of your dreams,
who you think isn't interested,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.507
gets down on one knee and
asks you to marry him,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.425
and you say, "I don't know."

01:33.927 --> 01:36.554
Okay, I understand.
Then what happened?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.515
- It just-- uh,
it happened so fast.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.350
I just didn't expect it,

01:40.433 --> 01:42.519
so I told him I needed
time to think about it,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.020
but that I didn't wanna
discuss it that night.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.314
And of course, we did end up
discussing it that night,

01:46.397 --> 01:48.358
all night long, and he--
and he was terrific.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.360
- Because he is terrific.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.988
- I know. I know.
And me saying I don't know,

01:54.072 --> 01:56.783
it wasn't because I'm unsure,
because I love David.

01:56.866 --> 02:00.036
I-- I know that he's the one,
I just-- phew, I just--

02:00.119 --> 02:02.247
I needed time to think about it,
and I had to tell you.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.874
- Oh, I am very
happy for you.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.293
Let me see.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.294
Wow.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.593
- Remember that really stupid
thing you did last fall?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.012
- Could you be
a little more specific?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.598
- I wrote an admissions essay
to CU and I threw it away.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
You went behind
my back, dug it out,

02:22.308 --> 02:23.393
turned it in, I got in.
- Yeah, right.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.062
Right, they accepted your
sorry ass, I remember that.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.356
- Yeah, well, in a couple
of days this sorry ass

02:28.439 --> 02:30.108
is graduating and I'm--

02:30.191 --> 02:33.069
- Well, congratulations.
You're welcome.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.029
So, you gonna invite anybody
to come check it out?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.407
- No, I'm not.
I'm not broadcasting it, either.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.742
- Why bother, it's just an
amazing accomplishment.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.870
- I suppose.
It's pretty cool.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.080
- Yeah, I suppose.
Finally, reinforcements.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.582
{\an5}(Steve)
- Said something
about making a sign,

02:45.665 --> 02:47.083
but nothing about
manual labor.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.752
What's up, D?
- Dude.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.755
- I'm, uh, sending a message.
Yeah.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.134
- Yeah, I suggested something
chaste yet seductive

02:56.217 --> 02:57.886
because it's--
well, it's Donna.

02:57.969 --> 03:01.097
- A love note.
How sweet, and yet so pathetic.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.473
What's the occasion?

03:02.557 --> 03:03.600
- I asked her
to marry me.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.936
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.606
- Oh, Dave!
All right, congratulations!

03:09.689 --> 03:11.649
Oh, that's great.
- Yeah, it would be great,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.067
except she said she had
to think about it.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.111
- Oh, ouch.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.488
You know what?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.490
Janet cut me down the
first time I asked her.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.619
- Ugh.
Women suck.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.536
- (chuckling)
- Nice.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.829
- Yeah, that's very
helpful, thank you.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.623
- Come on,
they want you to commit,

03:26.706 --> 03:28.583
when you finally do,
it's not enough.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.253
- Eventually, they come around.
Janet did.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.923
I'm sure Donna will too.
So, what are we writing here?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.759
- I suggested
"Consider yourself lucky."

03:37.842 --> 03:39.802
- Ha, the romantic talks.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.179
How about something
short and sweet like,

03:41.262 --> 03:42.639
"Marry me, I love you."

03:42.722 --> 03:44.474
- "Pretty please with
sugar on top."

03:44.557 --> 03:46.601
- Yeah, sugar coat it a
little bit, call her pumpkin.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.020
- I open myself up to you guys
and what do I get?

03:49.103 --> 03:51.022
{\an5}(both)
- Ridicule.
- Of course.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.108
Just make sure you don't
misspell anything, all right?

some ideas for Nouveau.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.285
Do you wanna hear them?

06:09.368 --> 06:10.578
- Yeah, sure.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.792
- Oh. Sorry.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.294
- (sighs)
Here, you can have mine.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.629
I'll just get something
at work.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.631
- Of course you can.
You're the breadwinner.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.675
- No, I insist.
- No, I insist.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.511
(scoffs)

06:26.594 --> 06:28.429
Janet, I hate what's
happening to us.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
- No, Steve, you hate
what's happening to you.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.600
Which astonishes me because
I happen to think

06:32.683 --> 06:34.477
that staying home
with Maddy is a privilege.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.479
- Yeah, and it's one you
choose not to exercise.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.147
- That is so unfair.
- Oh, give me a break!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.775
(door closes)

06:40.858 --> 06:42.777
- Uh, you know,
I can come back later.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.821
- No, it's okay,
I was just leaving.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.451
I'm really sorry about
your brother.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.537
- Yeah, thanks.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.251
(door opens, closes)

07:04.257 --> 07:05.842
- How's Julie Ann?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.468
- Uh, not so good.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.137
- Mmm.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.931
I remember when she was playing
with Maddy and Patrick too.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.059
They sure made
a great couple.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.854
- You know, she's--
she's pregnant.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.481
- Oh.
That's tough.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.525
- What?
- A kid growing up

07:22.608 --> 07:23.568
and never getting to know
his father.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.865
- Yeah.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.330
- Busy?

07:36.414 --> 07:39.250
- No, not really.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.877
I could use a
little break.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.712
- Looks nice.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.630
- Mmm, it's not much, but...

07:46.465 --> 07:50.052
I have three clients, and I
believe in every one of them.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.888
- And that's very important
to you, isn't it?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.890
Um, believing in what you do.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.934
- I think it's important
to everyone.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.228
- Yeah, important--
but with you, it's mandatory.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.607
- You say that like
it's a bad thing.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.234
- No.
You follow your heart.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.402
What could be wrong
with that?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.573
How's Matt?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.201
- He's, uh, devastated.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.579
- The other night you said
you wanted to know some things,

08:16.662 --> 08:19.832
but you had to talk
with Matt first.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.294
And I... I was just wondering
if you'd done that.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.047
- Actually, I haven't.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.842
- Well, um...

08:31.594 --> 08:34.639
tell him that I'm very
sorry for his loss.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.765
- Of course.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.606
- You know, I talked to
David about, uh, Donna.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.651
- Oh.
How is he doing?

08:46.734 --> 08:48.778
- He can't figure out
how two people

08:48.861 --> 08:50.279
so obviously
meant for each other

08:50.363 --> 08:53.157
can't seem to get together.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.453
To tell you the truth,
neither can I.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.258
(David)
- Hey.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.926
- Oh, hey, come here.
You gotta look at this.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.345
- Yeah, what?
- Yeah, right there.

09:18.557 --> 09:21.519
- Huh.
"I love Don."

09:21.602 --> 09:24.105
- Yeah, some girl must have
written it for her boyfriend.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.440
Isn't that romantic?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.734
- Donna.
- What?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.236
That's what it said.
It said, "I love Donna."

09:32.238 --> 09:35.283
- You did that?
- Yeah.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.285
You know, I could have sworn
I spelled your name right.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.788
- Aw, I don't know what to say.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.040
- You don't have to
say anything.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.710
I'm not trying to
pressure you, you know.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.421
I know it's scary,
and I know why.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.798
- Then you're way ahead of me.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.634
- Oh, come on, you're a
romantic, you always have been.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.555
I mean, you've been dreaming
about your engagement

09:57.638 --> 09:59.140
and your marriage forever,
and in your mind,

09:59.223 --> 10:01.934
it's perfect, and...

10:02.018 --> 10:04.687
well, reality's a little
different, you know?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.564
Especially with a guy like me.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.401
I understand it's probably
hard to accept.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.698
- That must have
taken you all night to do.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.200
- Yeah, but it was
worth it... Don.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.661
- (laughs)

10:26.417 --> 10:28.044
- Ready to talk about
the new magazine?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.212
- Oh, absolutely.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.381
I have a lot of
new ideas.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.759
But before we get started,

10:34.842 --> 10:36.761
I just-- I really
wanted to tell you

10:36.844 --> 10:40.181
how honored I feel by your
confidence in me.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.391
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.642
Traffic.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.394
I hate L.A.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.646
- Well, don't worry, I'm sure
the feeling is mutual.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.398
- (chuckles)

10:49.482 --> 10:51.359
- Janet Sosna,
Ava Small.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.277
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.405
So, let's start with the
name of your brainchild.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.908
"Nouveau."
How in the world did you manage

10:58.991 --> 11:01.410
to come up with the most
boring name possible?

11:01.494 --> 11:02.703
- Oh, I think it's catchy.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.538
- No, it's okay.
I admit right now...

11:04.622 --> 11:06.040
{\an5}- Mm-hmm?
- ...it's nothing,
it lacks focus.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.042
It has no theme,
no point of view.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.503
That's what I want you
to focus on.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.796
- Who?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.756
- Both of you.
But separately.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.634
I'm a firm believer in
healthy competition.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.469
I want your reports
by the end of the week.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.264
- What a dump.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.724
- Would you excuse me?

11:30.439 --> 11:31.774
Hi, um...

11:31.857 --> 11:34.068
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little confused.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.945
I thought you wanted me to
run this magazine.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.613
- Ava's from the
New York office.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.323
She helps me with all
my acquisitions.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.158
I trust her judgment.
(elevator dings)

11:41.242 --> 11:43.702
- I'm-- I'm sure you do,
but with all due respect,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.579
you didn't answer my question.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.457
- Just have your report
by the end of the week.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.376
I'll take it from there.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.976
- She's finally asleep.
- (laughs)

12:07.059 --> 12:08.978
You know, kids can be so
different, but they all hate

12:09.061 --> 12:10.813
having a bedtime,
that's for sure.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.482
- Well, my mom says Caitlin's
usually pretty good about it.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.486
It's just that she's making
adjustments, you know?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.946
- Having your mom
put you to bed is an adjustment

12:19.029 --> 12:21.615
worth making, if you ask me.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.783
You know?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.368
Mwah.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.371
- She asked me about you.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.123
- She did, huh?

12:29.206 --> 12:31.250
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd she say?

12:31.333 --> 12:32.668
- Well, she saw us
holding hands,

12:32.751 --> 12:35.379
and she wanted to know
if you were my boyfriend.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.839
- So, what did you tell her?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.174
- Well, that's the thing.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.175
I didn't really know
what to tell her.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.342
We haven't talked about it,

12:40.426 --> 12:43.637
and I sort of wanted us to
before I said anything to her.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.139
- Why don't you tell her
I'm absolutely crazy

12:45.222 --> 12:47.141
about her mother, huh?

12:51.061 --> 12:54.523
- Look, I know this is
incredibly premature,

12:54.607 --> 12:58.152
but the hardest thing for
a kid is to form attachments

12:58.235 --> 12:59.820
to somebody who's not
gonna stick around.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.781
- I understand
what you're saying.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.201
You know, she has enough
adjustments to make already.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.955
- I'm not asking for an answer
right now, but soon.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.542
I'm gonna need a commitment.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.344
(knocking on door)

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
- Hey, Janet home?

13:26.972 --> 13:29.225
- Very funny.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.559
- Hmm.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.067
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey, you.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.735
I thought-- I thought
you were on some world tour

13:39.818 --> 13:41.237
with Rush or something.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.072
- I was.
And I would've stayed too,

13:43.155 --> 13:44.406
if I'd known what
a drag you'd be.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.908
Poor thing,
someone bought

13:45.991 --> 13:47.743
his newspaper for, like,
a gazillion dollars.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.870
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
Congratulations.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.914
- It's not final yet.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.250
Although, if Janet has anything
to say about it, it will be.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.751
- What, she wants it
and you don't?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.753
- Seems like the new owner's
offering her respectability.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.588
I just get a paycheck.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.215
- And a chance to hang out
all day in your boxers.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.217
- Great.
- Oh, and be with your daughter.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.261
{\an5}- Mm.
- While the slobbering
wage slaves of the world

14:05.344 --> 14:07.429
sit in Sigalert hell,
getting brain cancer

14:07.513 --> 14:08.722
from being on their
cell phones too long.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.767
- I think what he just said--
very colorfully, might I add--

14:11.850 --> 14:14.311
is that now, you can
enjoy your life.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.355
- Contrary to popular opinion,
I'm not making that much money

14:16.438 --> 14:18.274
from the sale, okay?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.775
I'm gonna have to get a job
sooner or later.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.193
- Well, yeah, you'll--
you'll look for a job,

14:21.277 --> 14:23.529
just not right now.
Do it in, like, a month or two.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.155
And right now, just take
advantage of your time

14:25.239 --> 14:28.158
with Maddy, 'cause it
won't always be like this.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.286
- Work was a disaster.
Oh, company!

14:30.369 --> 14:31.954
- Hey, Janet.
- Hi, company.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.122
(Donna)
- Hi.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.623
- You could've called, honey.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.667
- Well, that's very
supportive.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.586
- It's 9:00.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.670
- Excuse me.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.091
- (clears throat)

14:50.681 --> 14:52.141
- (sighs)

14:55.394 --> 14:57.813
- Hi. I brought your dress
for Kelly's wedding.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.273
- Oh, thanks.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.025
- You wanna talk about it?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.987
- Yeah.
I'm not mad at Steve.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.905
I mad at myself.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.490
I pushed for the sale
of the <i> Beat,</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:09.658
and now I'm stuck retooling it

15:09.742 --> 15:12.620
and trying to get a second
publication off the ground.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.996
- I thought Steve said
you were loving it.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.498
- I was, in theory.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.667
But up close,
it might not be so great.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.170
- Can't you just get out of it?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.131
- That's the thing.
Steve and I had a deal.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.175
We'd only sell the paper
if we both agreed,

15:26.258 --> 15:28.177
but when he told me
he didn't want to, I insisted.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
- And now, you've changed
your mind?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.014
- I don't know, maybe.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.474
But I can't even
talk to him about it

15:33.557 --> 15:37.311
because I'm just way
too embarrassed.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.064
- Hmm. So, I guess
that little pep talk

15:40.147 --> 15:42.358
I had with him about how great
your arrangement is,

15:42.441 --> 15:43.859
it probably wasn't
a stroke of genius.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.195
- Not if he doesn't
take it to heart.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.488
- And if he does?
- If he does,

15:47.571 --> 15:51.158
you can just pay for the divorce
lawyers, and we'll call it even.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.910
- (chuckles)
Yeah, that's funny.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.038
Does it ever bother you

15:56.121 --> 15:59.541
when your relationship
just isn't perfect?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.711
- Perfect?
Our relationship?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.047
I'd say on a percentage basis,

16:05.130 --> 16:08.008
51/49 in favor
is a good day.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.718
- And you're happy with that?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.720
- That's not the
right question.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.223
It's that I accept it.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.599
And that makes me happy.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.694
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:28.779 --> 16:29.905
How was work?

16:29.988 --> 16:32.116
- Oh, it was okay.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.077
How about you, did you get
through that pile on your desk?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.830
- No, I just couldn't focus.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.374
- That's understandable.

16:40.457 --> 16:44.211
- Between Patrick and Julie Ann
and the baby.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.005
- The baby.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.595
- I, uh...

16:53.679 --> 16:56.807
I've been thinking about what
my responsibilities are.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.309
- (sighs)

16:59.393 --> 17:02.271
Have they changed?

17:02.354 --> 17:05.232
- That's what I'm
trying to decide.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.192
- Whether or not
to be a parent.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.279
- I had no intention
of being one.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.115
Not when he had a father.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.992
But now, he doesn't--
or he does,

17:16.076 --> 17:19.246
just not the one
he's supposed to have.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.540
I don't know.
It's complicated.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.799
- I know,
I know I'm obsessing,

17:30.883 --> 17:33.135
but "Don" just wasn't
doing it for me.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.846
- Just remember, being a
perfectionist is overrated.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.473
- Hey, I didn't say that.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.101
- Mmm, well, the point is
what you did say.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.980
You said that I had
this image of perfection.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.315
And you're right.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.776
And then Janet
talked to me about

17:48.859 --> 17:51.195
needing to accept that
that's not possible,

17:51.278 --> 17:53.655
that it's not even
really a good thing.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.200
And, well, she was right too.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.660
- Well, finally,
my mediocrity's an asset.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.662
- Shut up.
(chuckles)

18:00.746 --> 18:03.707
You're incredible.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.168
You're loyal and
you're honest and...

18:06.251 --> 18:07.836
(sighs)
...any girl would be crazy

18:07.920 --> 18:09.004
not to fall in love with you.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.672
- Oh, now, you're
embarrassing me.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.966
- Just think,
when I first met you,

18:13.050 --> 18:16.386
you were this adorable
little freshman,

18:16.470 --> 18:17.846
so caring and sensitive.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.348
- Okay, you can stop now.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.016
- (chuckles)
It's just...

18:21.099 --> 18:25.521
over the past ten years,
we've really grown up together,

18:25.604 --> 18:29.066
and we've had to deal with
all kinds of obstacles

18:29.149 --> 18:31.068
that have always
stood in our way.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.154
- You know I feel
the same way, right?

18:36.240 --> 18:39.576
And that my love for you
hasn't changed?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
- I know.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.040
That's what I'm trying to say.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.585
I wanna be totally
devoted to you.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.711
To us.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.091
- Why, Donna Martin, are you
asking me to marry you?

18:54.174 --> 18:58.262
- Yes, David Silver,
will you marry me?

18:58.345 --> 19:01.056
- I think I will.
- (chuckles)

19:01.139 --> 19:03.308
I love you.
- I love you.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.585
{\an5}(Steve)
- All right, kiddo, let's just
get one thing straight.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.587
It's not that I don't think

19:31.670 --> 19:33.088
taking care of you
is a privilege.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.757
It is, no question.

19:35.841 --> 19:40.262
Poopy diapers, the spit ups,
the 5 A.M. wake-up calls.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.598
It's all okay, Maddy.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.058
But let's be honest,
you got no three-point shot.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.810
You can't go to the left.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.272
You're not the world's
greatest conversationalist.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.608
I'm sorry.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.109
It's just that
there's more to life

19:54.192 --> 19:56.486
than strained carrots
and a good nap.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.114
(Maddy coos)

19:59.197 --> 20:00.449
What?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.619
- Dada.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.912
- No way.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.538
Time out, time out, time out.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.165
(laughs)

20:08.248 --> 20:09.791
Did you just say
what I think you said?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.084
I think you said
your first word.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.794
Maddy, you're gonna
say millions--

20:12.878 --> 20:14.838
millions of words over
the course of your life.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.841
But none will ever sound as
sweet as your first one.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.218
Dada.
(Maddy coos)

20:32.773 --> 20:35.108
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.779
- Mmm.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.489
I just had the most
amazing dream.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.490
You wanna hear about it?

20:41.573 --> 20:42.991
- Mm-hmm.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.204
- I was on the beach

20:47.287 --> 20:49.206
and this beautiful woman
asked me to marry her.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.999
- Smart girl.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.293
- Yeah, I was
a little surprised,

20:53.377 --> 20:57.506
but of course, I covered with
my usual wit and charm.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.007
- (chuckles)

20:59.091 --> 21:00.801
Well, now you're going
from reality to fantasy.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.594
- Very funny.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.516
(phone ringing)

21:07.599 --> 21:10.394
(sighs)

21:10.477 --> 21:11.395
- Hello.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.021
- Hi.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.315
This is the sweetest thing
I have ever seen.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.985
- What?
- What you wrote in the sand.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.112
Has Donna seen it?
- Mm-hmm.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.699
- Well, I just wanted you to
know that when I saw it,

21:23.782 --> 21:25.200
it made me smile.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.451
I haven't done that
in a while.

21:26.535 --> 21:30.372
- Good-- I know you're in a real
interesting place right now.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.541
- Yeah, I'm okay.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.377
- Listen, if you need to talk
or anything, I'm here.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.213
- Thanks.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.298
I hope Donna knows
how lucky she is.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.804
- Yeah, I think she does.

21:45.887 --> 21:49.099
By the way, Dylan, uh,
didn't want me to tell anyone,

21:49.182 --> 21:51.727
but he's graduating
from college today.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
I just thought you might
wanna know.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.731
- Thanks. Bye.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.196
- You think she does what?

22:03.280 --> 22:07.367
- Um...
thought you knew

22:07.451 --> 22:09.411
how lucky I feel.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.163
- Mmm.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.248
Do we really get to spend the
rest of our lives together?

22:13.331 --> 22:15.125
- Mm-hmm.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.045
If I have anything
to say about it.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.140
- Rise and shine.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.101
Hey.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.562
- What time is it?
- It's 7:45.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.272
- (groans)

22:37.355 --> 22:38.398
- Cream, no sugar, right?

22:41.359 --> 22:43.236
- You're annoyingly chipper.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.322
- Well, why shouldn't I be?
I've got a beautiful wife.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.616
I have an adorable baby
that says "Dada."

22:47.699 --> 22:49.493
I got lots of money in the bank.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.244
You know they're putting in
new playground equipment

22:51.328 --> 22:53.246
down at the beach?
- Maddy says "Dada"?

22:53.330 --> 22:56.124
- Well, yeah, she said it once
or twice, kinda sorta,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.418
but you know,
it could've been gas.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.296
Anyway, we're gonna
check it out.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.632
- Who are you and what
have you done with my husband?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.259
- You know him--
grumpy, bitter...

23:06.343 --> 23:08.095
- I know I haven't supported
our arrangement.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.515
But I've been
thinking about it.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.100
And the more I think about it,

23:13.183 --> 23:14.726
the more I realize
how lucky I am.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.687
- (sighs)
- Hey.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.190
That's a good thing.

23:20.273 --> 23:23.318
- Hmm?
I know. I know.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.487
I'm sorry, I just-- I've been
up most of the night.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.655
- That's why
you're gonna be late.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.032
You got a deadline.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.283
- You guys are
going to the beach?

23:30.367 --> 23:32.160
- No, tomorrow we're gonna
go to the beach.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.245
Today, we're going
to the amusement park.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.164
You know, I may actually buy
a season's pass for us.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.171
{\an5}(Noah)
- All right,
pay attention, okay?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.464
{\an5}(Nat)
- Yeah.
- The wrap goes up

23:44.548 --> 23:46.258
through the hole, all right?

23:46.341 --> 23:47.843
Around the tree.
- Mm-hmm?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.846
- You got it?
Back down the hole. Boom.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.181
Give it a yank.
There you go, try it.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.142
- You think you're the only guy

23:55.225 --> 23:56.726
that's ever been on a boat?
- I'm the only guy that's been

23:56.810 --> 23:59.354
asked to crew the Sanita Hobart
race, thank you very much.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.398
- Okay, here we go.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.361
- Through the hole,
around the tree...

24:06.444 --> 24:07.988
through the hole.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.323
- (snickers)
That's not good.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.325
Try it again.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.869
- I'll take anything, Nat,
make it greasy.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.911
I haven't eaten
in like a week.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.205
- Something greasy coming up.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.082
Sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.087
- You know how to make
one of these? Come here.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.757
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.052
Um, that woman you're seeing--
she's a single mom, isn't she?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.013
- Yeah.
Yeah, her daughter's six.

24:33.096 --> 24:36.558
- Really? What's that like?
- What do you mean?

24:36.641 --> 24:38.560
- Well, my sister-in-law,
she's pregnant, and I guess

24:38.643 --> 24:41.104
I'm just wondering how tough
things are gonna be for her.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.400
- It's Ellen's whole life.
- Is that good or bad?

24:45.483 --> 24:48.904
- It's intimidating,
I'll tell you that.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.238
- What about her daughter?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.199
- Caitlin.
- Yeah, does she talk

24:52.282 --> 24:53.491
about her dad or ask
questions about him?

24:56.453 --> 24:59.706
What?
- Ellen asked me to commit.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.291
I mean, not-- not like
you and Kelly,

25:01.374 --> 25:03.585
but still in a serious way.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.670
{\an5}- Mmm.
- I think she wants
to protect Caitlin

25:05.754 --> 25:07.631
from losing somebody else
she cares about.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.549
- What'd you tell her?

25:09.633 --> 25:12.010
- I didn't tell her
anything yet.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.304
I don't know if Caitlin
thinks about her dad

25:14.387 --> 25:17.307
or-- or asks about him.

25:17.390 --> 25:21.061
Sometimes, she gets this
really sad look in her eyes.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.104
I think that's probably why.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.401
- You ever look around
and ask yourself,

25:28.485 --> 25:29.653
"How the hell did
this happen to me?"

25:29.736 --> 25:31.196
- (laughs)

25:31.279 --> 25:33.573
Yeah, all the time.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.121
(knocking on door)

25:42.207 --> 25:43.458
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:43.541 --> 25:47.295
- Bad time?
- No, perfect, as usual.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.464
I, uh, never did know how
to tie one of these.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.800
- Mmm.
You look great.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.802
What's the special occasion?

25:53.885 --> 25:56.346
- It's nothing worth breaking
the old monkey suit out for.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.140
- I don't know about that.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.642
- Why, did you talk
to David?

26:00.725 --> 26:03.311
- Yes, I did.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.480
But don't worry,
he didn't tell anyone else.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.440
- (sighs)
- And if you insist on keeping

26:07.524 --> 26:09.818
this thing that is so great
a secret, neither will I.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.319
That is, if you
let me come along.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.488
- It's private.

26:13.571 --> 26:15.991
- Graduation day is one of the
least private days of your life.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.159
- For you, maybe, but for me,
it's private.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.494
- Fine.

26:19.577 --> 26:22.289
Stupid, but fine.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.207
How 'bout you let me take you
out to dinner to celebrate?

26:24.291 --> 26:27.043
- Okay, if you let me
pick the spot.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.670
- All right, as long
as it's not some dump.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.380
This is a big deal.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.590
There.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.843
- Thanks.
- Who would have thought?

26:34.926 --> 26:38.471
You actually seeing something
all the way through.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.974
- If you don't like it,
I don't have to do it again.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.310
- Oh, I kinda like it.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.811
- Hmm.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.354
- I'm proud of you.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.524
- (sighs)

26:49.607 --> 26:51.526
So, you wanna walk me out?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.111
- Mm-hmm.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.246
(both laughing)

27:06.124 --> 27:08.418
- Hey, what's going on?

27:08.501 --> 27:11.171
- Oh, Ava was just telling me
about her idea for Nouveau.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.213
- Tell her-- tell her
about the column.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.090
- "Tilting at Windmills."

27:14.174 --> 27:16.134
(both laughing)

27:17.761 --> 27:20.889
- Um, I thought that we weren't
supposed to share our ideas.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.725
Healthy competition and all.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.227
Do you want a chair?

27:26.311 --> 27:28.021
- We can finish later.
- Mm-hmm.

27:28.104 --> 27:30.023
(both chuckling)

27:31.316 --> 27:32.567
- I thought that our
reports weren't due

27:32.650 --> 27:33.443
until the end of the week.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.363
- Oh, Ava just was too
excited to wait.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.239
And a suggestion?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.991
Stop acting like I've
taken something from you.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.496
(phone ringing)

27:50.001 --> 27:51.503
- Hello.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.921
(Steve)
- Check your e-mail.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.923
-<i> What?</i>
- Oh, just do it.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.925
- Tell her the file's called
"Maddy's World Tour."

27:57.008 --> 27:58.259
- If you're having a bad day,

27:58.343 --> 28:00.053
this is definitely
gonna cheer you up.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.602
- Aw.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.479
Where are you guys?

28:09.562 --> 28:11.606
- We're at the amusement park.
I told you, remember?

28:11.689 --> 28:13.441
- We took Maddy
on the teacup ride.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.068
- Four times-- she loved it.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.278
- Well, it sounds great.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.323
(bell rings)
- Uh-oh.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.491
Look at that,
ice cream dead ahead.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.284
Come on.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.536
- Gotta go, honey.
Busy day.

28:24.619 --> 28:25.954
Love you. Bye.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.832
- Yeah, I gotta go.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.085
Very busy.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.391
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.811
I brought lunch.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.521
But is it okay if we take
a walk first?

28:51.604 --> 28:54.315
- Yeah, it's fine.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.484
So, how's Julie Ann?
Have you talked to her today?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.486
- Yeah. Yeah, her mom's staying
with her for a week.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.322
It helps if she's not alone.
- Oh.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.366
You know, we should find
a restaurant in New York

29:03.450 --> 29:06.953
that she likes and have them
deliver in a few times a week.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.997
- That's a good idea.
In fact, I know a place,

29:09.080 --> 29:11.040
and I'll call this afternoon.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.960
- Just like that.
- What?

29:14.043 --> 29:16.796
- The way you take
care of things.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.631
- I'm just ordering her dinner.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.175
- And that.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.051
The way you make it
seem so easy.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.679
You do that with everything.

29:24.762 --> 29:29.893
When Lauren was sick,
you were patient and loving.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.022
When Patrick needed you,
you were there.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.858
And now,
Julie Ann and the baby.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.569
- I hope you don't think any of
that came at your expense,

29:39.652 --> 29:43.406
because we are a team
and we make decisions together.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.867
- Mm-hmm, but we don't
agree about this.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.702
- Sure, we do.

29:47.785 --> 29:50.205
We agree that-- that
what is important,

29:50.288 --> 29:52.957
what comes first
is our relationship.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.377
And if making that relationship
work means me being the best,

29:56.461 --> 29:58.546
most caring uncle that
that baby could ever have,

29:58.630 --> 30:00.882
then that's what I'm gonna be.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.343
- I know you don't think that's
the right thing to do, though.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.387
- Well, yeah.
If it was up to me,

30:06.471 --> 30:08.097
I'd be the baby's father,
but it's not.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.724
It's up to us.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.731
- I can't ask you
to do that.

30:16.814 --> 30:17.899
- Of course, you can.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.068
- No, I can't.
You don't understand.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.611
I can't.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.030
- Kelly, what is it?
What's-- what's going on?

30:24.113 --> 30:26.324
- I just need to be alone
for a while.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.909
Think.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.912
Is that okay?

30:30.995 --> 30:34.749
- Okay, well, I, uh-- I brought
you the avocado-sprouts sandwich

30:34.832 --> 30:37.544
and some of that eggless potato
salad that you love so much.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.591
We're gonna figure this out.
I promise.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.235
(doorbell rings)

31:02.318 --> 31:03.945
- Yeah, I'm coming.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.242
One large thick crust
with pepperoni.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.160
- Great.
- And that's $16.50.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.746
- Keep the change.
- This is a 50.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.872
- Yeah, life's good.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.128
Dinner's served.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.130
- Mmm.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.465
I can't believe we blew off
the whole day.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.134
Can we do it again tomorrow?

31:26.217 --> 31:28.803
- Yeah, I think we can.
- (laughs)

31:28.886 --> 31:30.138
Ooh, yum.
- Mmm.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.807
- Uh... totally forgot.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.809
What-- what were we talking
about before the doorbell rang?

31:34.892 --> 31:37.145
- Um... oh.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.479
Yeah, I was saying,
you know, I don't think

31:38.563 --> 31:40.315
you should change your name.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.150
I mean, it'd be a little weird
if Donna Martin Originals

31:42.233 --> 31:44.485
was owned and operated
by Donna Silver.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.530
- What about when we have kids?
- We'll worry about it then.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.782
- Mmm.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.784
You know what?
- Hmm?

31:51.868 --> 31:53.703
- I want two kids.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.622
And I want them both
to look like you.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.998
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.292
(chuckles)
- Mmm.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.127
- Mmm, don't you wish
we could just rewind

32:01.210 --> 32:04.005
the last three years?

32:04.088 --> 32:06.007
- No, not really.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.676
- What?
You liked playing the field?

32:08.760 --> 32:09.969
- No, not really.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.181
- (laughing)
- You know what?

32:13.264 --> 32:17.393
I'm glad I did,
because now, I realize

32:17.477 --> 32:18.811
how lucky I am to be with you.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.480
- Oh, that was sweet.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.732
- Mmm, thank you.
I wrote it last night.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.525
- (chuckles)

32:24.609 --> 32:25.860
- You know what?
I do have a problem.

32:25.943 --> 32:28.988
- What?
- Well...

32:29.072 --> 32:31.532
I kind of want our kids
to look like you.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.867
- How 'bout if we compromise?

32:32.950 --> 32:34.869
50/50.

32:34.952 --> 32:37.497
- 50/50, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.706
- All right, I think
that can be arranged.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.041
- Okay.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.171
- Oh, boy, are we gonna
miss out on pizza too?

32:46.631 --> 32:48.299
(both laugh)

32:52.261 --> 32:54.138
(knocking on door)

32:55.556 --> 32:57.100
- We have a problem.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.061
Matt is a great guy.
He's incredibly thoughtful.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.938
He wouldn't lie to me,
he would do anything for me.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.564
- Oh.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.608
So, what's the problem?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.235
- You know what
the problem is, Dylan.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.611
- No, I don't.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.613
- You're not thoughtful.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.865
I can't trust you, and you
wouldn't do anything for me.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.618
- Now, that is not true.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.203
- It's how I feel.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.913
- Then you gotta
give me a chance.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.582
I'll make you feel differently.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.627
- No. Not if you're gonna
let me down again.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.555
- Yeah, imagine that.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.474
Me with a degree
in Humanities.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.185
- How was it?

33:42.645 --> 33:44.355
- It was okay.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.068
Kelly...

33:51.738 --> 33:54.824
I will never let you down.

34:08.670 --> 34:11.549
- Okay, I'll see you then,
11:00.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.386
I love you too.

34:19.556 --> 34:20.558
(groans)

34:20.641 --> 34:22.643
Just so you know what you're
getting yourself into,

34:22.726 --> 34:25.646
I am going directly to hell.
- You're not going to hell.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.940
You didn't do anything wrong.
We didn't do anything wrong.

34:28.024 --> 34:31.527
We just stayed up talking
all night, it's not a crime.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.987
- Matt is the most
decent person I know.

34:34.071 --> 34:35.822
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.658
- Well, it's true.

34:37.742 --> 34:41.286
- I know it's true.
He's very decent.

34:41.370 --> 34:46.167
He's, uh, just in a
tough spot right now, but...

34:46.250 --> 34:49.337
these are not reasons
to marry somebody.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.009
- You know what I want
more than anything?

34:56.761 --> 34:59.847
Peace.
- Yeah.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.642
- I just want a little peace.

35:04.143 --> 35:07.021
- I want you to call me
after you talk to Matt.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.400
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.860
- That's funny.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.445
Matt keeps saying
the same thing.

35:32.713 --> 35:34.006
- Breakfast!

35:34.090 --> 35:35.258
- Mmm.

35:37.593 --> 35:40.054
You know, I think this
might be some kind of a record

35:40.137 --> 35:42.223
for most consecutive meals
eaten in one place.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.725
- Yeah, except we don't
actually eat any of 'em.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.602
- Yeah, that's about to change.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.606
What?

35:50.690 --> 35:53.693
- You've lost interest
in me already, haven't you?

35:53.776 --> 35:55.570
- Donna, we haven't eaten
in two days.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.113
Admit it, you're starving.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.906
- I'm starving.
- Thank you.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.992
- (chuckles)
Mmm.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.745
What kind of wedding
do you think we should have?

36:04.829 --> 36:06.455
- Whatever you want.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.583
- Mmm.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.378
You're gonna make some woman
a very good husband one day.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.713
- You know, one of these days,
we should probably get around

36:13.796 --> 36:15.756
to telling our families.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.926
- Yeah.
That's a good idea.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.095
Okay, can I have the phone?
- Yeah?

36:21.178 --> 36:22.471
- Mm-hmm.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.309
Watch this.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.939
Mom?
Hey.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.733
Are you sitting down?

36:33.816 --> 36:35.651
Guess what?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.409
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.286
Uh, come on in, you want--
want me to get you some coffee

36:45.369 --> 36:47.455
or something?
- No, I'm okay, I-- no.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.124
- It'll only take a second.
- I just wanna talk to you.

36:50.207 --> 36:51.500
- Okay.

36:54.211 --> 36:56.797
- I think you should
father the child.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.424
- You do?

36:58.507 --> 37:02.511
- Yeah, I... I think
it would be the...

37:02.595 --> 37:05.139
best thing for you.

37:05.222 --> 37:06.974
- But what about for us?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.809
Our wedding?

37:08.893 --> 37:10.728
Kelly, what?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.815
- I am so sorry.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.317
- Sorry about what?

37:16.400 --> 37:21.113
- (sighs)
I, um... I can't marry you.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.620
I know I'm gonna regret this.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.497
- No, you're not
gonna regret this,

37:29.580 --> 37:31.666
because that's not happening,
okay?

37:31.749 --> 37:33.292
You're not
backing out of this.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.003
- You deserve better than me.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.546
- Kelly, you are the one
that I want.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.715
- I'm sorry.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.641
- Dylan put you up to this,
didn't he?

37:48.724 --> 37:50.810
- No, he didn't, but he does
have something to do with it.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.436
- Something to do with it.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.689
He told you about my sleeping
with Amy in the desert.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.691
Kelly, it was a mistake.

37:56.774 --> 38:00.069
And no matter how Dylan
spins it, it was meaningless.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.821
Now, I would have
told you myself,

38:01.904 --> 38:03.531
but I was scared,
and-- and that was wrong.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.659
But Dylan only told you
so he can break us up.

38:06.742 --> 38:08.452
And I think we're
a lot stronger than that.

38:10.746 --> 38:13.124
- Dylan didn't tell me
anything.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.712
- Well, then who did?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.172
- You did.
Just now.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.050
- Kelly--
- No, don't, okay?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.719
Just don't.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.558
- Can you honestly say

38:30.641 --> 38:33.185
that you haven't been even more
unfaithful in your own way?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.025
- No, I can't.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.738
Which is why I know
that breaking up

38:43.821 --> 38:45.031
is the right thing to do.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.541
(Ava and Charles chattering)

38:55.624 --> 38:58.669
- We should focus on sexual
politics in the workplace.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.091
- It's official.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.135
- What is?
- The sale of the paper.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.095
I finalized documents
this morning,

39:08.179 --> 39:09.764
which is why I'm here--
to celebrate.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.934
And to apologize.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.772
I never should've
doubted you.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.982
As always, you knew what
was best for the both of us.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.735
- Mmm, I don't know about that.

39:22.818 --> 39:25.905
And if you think this is the
wrong thing to do, honey...

39:25.988 --> 39:27.323
- I'm gonna get Yoffe.

39:27.406 --> 39:29.909
In the meantime,
check these out.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.458
(Ava laughing)

39:53.224 --> 39:55.810
- I am so sorry about this.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.521
- Mommy!
- Hi.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.648
When I found out
I couldn't get off work,

40:00.731 --> 40:02.191
if you hadn't been able to pick
Caitlin up from day care,

40:02.274 --> 40:03.484
I don't know what
I would have done.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.985
- It's okay.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.987
- Can Noah stay longer?

40:07.071 --> 40:09.281
Please, Mommy?

40:09.365 --> 40:10.825
- We actually had
a lot of fun.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.702
- We turned my room
into a rocket ship.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.831
It is so cool.
You have to come see it.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.874
(both laughing)

40:20.251 --> 40:24.004
- Wow!

40:24.088 --> 40:25.965
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

40:28.425 --> 40:30.177
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.014
I just-- she's so happy.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.891
(sighs)

40:37.768 --> 40:42.064
- Listen, the other day,
you asked me to commit.

40:44.775 --> 40:48.154
The truth is
I just can't right now.

40:50.614 --> 40:54.034
I mean, I love being with you
and Caitlin is amazing.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.662
- But it's too quick.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.665
- Yeah, for me, it is.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.087
- Well, thank you for
being so up-front.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.506
- If we could just slow things
down a little bit--

41:07.590 --> 41:09.383
(Caitlin)
- Mom, come on.

41:09.466 --> 41:10.801
- Well, we can't.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.277
- You didn't call.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.778
Got a little worried.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.991
- Why didn't you tell me
about Amy?

41:38.287 --> 41:40.122
- (sighs)

41:43.000 --> 41:45.419
It was none of my business.

41:45.502 --> 41:48.589
- You lied for him.
You lied to me.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.299
- Yeah.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.969
But if I told you--

41:54.053 --> 41:55.387
- I would have broken off
the engagement

41:55.471 --> 41:56.639
a lot sooner than I did.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.224
- And come to me?

42:00.518 --> 42:03.062
Probably?

42:03.145 --> 42:06.232
And been with me because
you were mad at him.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.236
I didn't want that.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.947
- So, you were just gonna sit
back and watch me marry Matt,

42:13.030 --> 42:14.573
knowing that he had
cheated on me.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.284
- You were committed to him.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.955
- See, that is why this
will never work between us.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.623
- Why?
- Because you had this

42:22.706 --> 42:24.625
life-altering piece
of information

42:24.708 --> 42:26.168
and you kept it from me.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.463
I thought we were friends.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.590
- Yeah.

42:31.674 --> 42:35.177
And when you get some
distance on this...

42:35.261 --> 42:38.347
(sighs)
...you'll see I acted like one.
