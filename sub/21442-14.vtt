shots shown could be dangerous.

Do not try this at home

yourself or someone else.

What's up, guys?

00:09.209 --> 00:11.111
Welcome back to another episode
of the "Dude Perfect" show.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.947
We started making battle
videos four years ago.

00:14.013 --> 00:16.449
We've had 28 total battles.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.351
You guys know how many
Coby Cotton has won?

00:18.418 --> 00:19.652
- How many?

00:19.719 --> 00:23.857
- Zero. Nil.
Until now.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.626
Coby Cotton has won a battle!

And that is why
we gotta have ourselves

00:44.644 --> 00:47.514
a full blown-out parade.

I just don't feel like
I need a costume at all.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.065
Why are we even doing a parade?

02:12.131 --> 02:13.867

I, Coby Cotton, am a winner.

- And I appreciate that.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.717
Listen, I think this
is a little bit overkill,

02:30.783 --> 02:32.485
but I'll go with you guys on it.

This is your parade.

You don't want to look
like everybody else.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.460
- Oh, boy.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.961
That curtain could be
a little bit bigger.

stay in the middle.

Does it look better when I
keep my eyes open very wide?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.576
- It's creepy no
matter how you do it.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.346
- COBY: Guys, I feel
like we found it.

03:00.413 --> 03:03.516

down a little bit.

won many battles.

That's how you
get to be a gladiator.

about your skirt flaring up.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.070
- I'm definitely worried
about the skirt flaring up.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.838
- It's supposed to be
windy for the parade day,

03:25.905 --> 03:29.576
and that could be a risk
and danger to us all, yeah.

Okay, let's see the next look.

ridiculous, Cobe?

04:15.221 --> 04:17.223
Is a man who can't win
a battle in three years.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.627
- Hey, I won a battle
in three years.

coming to my parade talk.

We need you to help him nail it.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.457
- Yeah, once in a lifetime.
Practice makes perfect, okay?

05:24.524 --> 05:26.259
We can do this.
- I've heard that before.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.527
- Well, Shannon, he's all yours.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.162

and your followers.

are you going to do this?

05:47.814 --> 05:48.915
- Ladies and gentlemen,

05:48.981 --> 05:50.717
thank you guys so much
for being here today.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.385
I can't tell you how
much it means, uh,

05:52.452 --> 05:53.720
'cause it means a lot.

05:53.786 --> 05:57.590
Um, I, as I was thinking
about this speech,

05:57.657 --> 05:59.926
feel like you guys
are a bunch of ants.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.464
And when I say that, I don't
mean that in a negative way.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.032
- SHANNON: So you're
crossing your arms here.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.200
You're feeling uncomfortable.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.534
We don't want to
show the audience

06:08.601 --> 06:09.836
that you feel uncomfortable.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.004
You want to make sure
you feel kind of comfortable.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.041
You don't want to move your
arms around too, too much.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.642
- See you guys back there.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.078
- That might be the
wrong nonverbal behavior.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.513
- Oh, no?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.849
This event takes me back
to a time in my life

06:22.915 --> 06:25.585
when I was in fifth grade,
and I was playing baseball.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.487
I shouldn't tell the old story.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.490
- Coby, when you're delivering
a motivational message,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.592
there's gotta be
some kind of content

06:32.658 --> 06:34.460
or meat and potatoes behind it,
you know?

06:34.527 --> 06:35.862
- COBY: I can do that.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.363
For me, it's been battles,

06:37.430 --> 06:39.398
which are actual videos that
I've had to compete in.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.501
But for other people, they all
have battles in their life

06:41.567 --> 06:43.469
that they have to, you know,
tackle themselves.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.071
- Oh, that's good wordplay.
Use that.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.339
- SHANNON: Exactly.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.107
And think about people
all across the world.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.675
They know what that feels like,

06:49.742 --> 06:53.279
to maybe have a 3, 4,
12-year losing streak.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.182
- That's good, Shannon.
That's good.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.717
- I like her.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.753
- What helped me the most was
sticking with it, first of all,

07:00.820 --> 07:03.289
never giving up, and then the
encouragement of my friends

07:03.356 --> 07:05.658
and family, because you're
nothing on your own.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.360
- That's the first time
he's gotten that deep.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.928
- I think you're ready.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.630
- I feel ready.
Thank you.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.532
I've started to feel it myself.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.400
How much time do I
have before the parade?

09:11.417 --> 09:13.119
Coby, take a seat
on your throne.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.155
This is a day that a lot of
us thought might never happen.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.025
There's some of you out there
that commented on every video.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.626
And you said, you know what?

09:20.693 --> 09:22.995
There will be a day when Coby
Cotton brings home a victory.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.531

your very first trophy.

- Oh, wow!

09:29.802 --> 09:31.270
- [cheering]

09:31.337 --> 09:33.606
- Hoist it high
and hoist it proud.

09:33.673 --> 09:36.943
Coby's first battle victory.
- Oh, it feels so good!

09:37.009 --> 09:41.614
- TYLER: Hoist it high, Cobe!
Yes! Yes!

09:41.681 --> 09:44.417
- [chanting] Speech!

09:44.483 --> 09:46.953
- Oh, man, guys, wow!
This feels good.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.956
First of all, I'd like to
start with a story, if I may.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.390
- You may.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.759
- Once upon a time,
there was a bus.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.462
And that bus was named Struggle.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.031
I rode that Struggle
bus through 25, 26,

09:59.098 --> 10:01.634
maybe even 27 battle losses.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.370
There were times when kids would
come up to me in the streets

10:04.437 --> 10:06.806
and ask, Coby, will you
ever win a battle?

10:06.872 --> 10:09.108
You know you're in a bad place
when you start answering

10:09.175 --> 10:12.111
those kids, I don't know, buddy.
I just don't know.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.746
- [chuckling]

10:13.813 --> 10:17.450
- But very recently, I'm
stepping off that Struggle bus

10:17.516 --> 10:20.987
because I, Coby Cotton,
won my very first battle.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.154
- [cheering]

10:22.221 --> 10:24.357
- Yeah, you did!
Yes, you did!

10:24.423 --> 10:25.691
- Thank you.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.326
And I know it may look like it,

10:27.393 --> 10:29.161
but today's
not actually about me.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.730
Today's about you guys.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.965
Each of you is fighting
your own battle.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.934
It may be a vegetable
you don't like

10:35.001 --> 10:37.603
or that pesky homework you
just don't want to finish.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.740

In order to figure out

- MISS MATHIS: Jupiter?

16:04.797 --> 16:05.964

16:09.034 --> 16:10.903

count Pluto as a planet.

16:12.671 --> 16:13.772
- You were wrong.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.401
- CODY: Tie, boys.
Tied ballgame.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.669
Whoever gets the next question
right moves on to the finale.

17:17.736 --> 17:21.473
- All right, what is the largest
and heaviest internal organ

17:21.540 --> 17:23.208
in the human body?

17:23.275 --> 17:26.612
- To me, it's kinda like I need
to figure out what an organ is,

17:26.678 --> 17:28.647
to be honest with you.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.616
- Let's see your answers.

17:30.682 --> 17:31.950
- Mine can be either.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.719
{\an8}- MISS MATHIS: Large intestine.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.754
{\an8}Heart.
The liver.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.589
{\an8}The large intestine.

17:37.656 --> 17:38.957
Liver.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.292
- [laughs]

17:40.359 --> 17:42.127
- TYLER: What?
No way!

17:42.194 --> 17:43.962
I want a recount!

17:44.029 --> 17:45.798
- We are failing right now!

17:45.864 --> 17:47.866
I've been telling
them for years!

17:47.933 --> 17:49.968
- This is not right!

17:50.035 --> 17:52.237
- I'm a smart person.
I'm just sarcastic!

17:52.304 --> 17:54.206
I'll see you in the finale, Cor.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.576
- So you're telling me

17:57.643 --> 18:00.479
Cory is the strongest member
of "Dude Perfect"?

18:00.546 --> 18:02.714
- You can't say that
with a clear face.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.318
- Cody Jones is the smartest
member of "Dude Perfect."

18:06.385 --> 18:07.486
- Aw, man.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.121
- And they're about
to battle it out.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.589
- That's correct.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.692
- I think we gotta play it out.
What wins, brain or brawn?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.761
And for the finale, here we go.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.095
Boys?

18:17.162 --> 18:18.864
Hurts me to say it,
but congratulations.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.666
- Don't let me down, dude.
- What a day.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.202
- ♪ Ooh ♪

18:25.137 --> 18:27.339
♪ Here we go, ooh ♪

18:31.109 --> 18:33.245
- TYLER: Here we are,
the final culmination

18:33.312 --> 18:35.447
of the "Dude Perfect" brain
versus brawn challenge.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.616
This is the real deal.
You guys ready to see

18:37.683 --> 18:39.551
what we have in store
for the final competition?

18:39.618 --> 18:40.819
- I'm indeed ready.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.188
- Let's take a look.
Fist station, math and arrows.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.990
We'll read you a math
problem to solve.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.458
In order to move on,

18:46.525 --> 18:49.328
you have to use the bow and
arrow to hit the correct answer.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.297
Second station,
presidential pigskin.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.266
There are six people on display.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.035
You have to hit the one person
who is not a president

18:57.102 --> 18:59.271
with one of your footballs.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.407
And finally, we've got
the crossbeam crossword.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.310
The first person to solve the
crossword puzzle will win

19:05.377 --> 19:08.780
the "Dude Perfect" brain
versus brawn competition.

19:08.847 --> 19:09.982
- [claps]

19:10.048 --> 19:11.483
- Here it is!
- Woo!

19:11.550 --> 19:15.087
- TYLER: Genius Cody.
Super-strong Cory!

19:15.153 --> 19:21.159
{\an5}Gentlemen, your math
problem is 126 times 21.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.862
{\an5}- Go!

19:23.929 --> 19:25.430
And they're off.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.001
Oh, oh and do they have the
answer or are they abandoning?

19:29.067 --> 19:31.737
Oh, no!
Cory fumbles the bow!

19:31.803 --> 19:33.539
Cody, he may have it.

19:33.605 --> 19:34.873
- [ding]

19:34.940 --> 19:36.808
- COBY: Oh my goodness!

19:36.875 --> 19:38.377
{\an8}Cody coming strong
out of the gate.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.145
{\an8}Someone paid attention
in math class.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.714
Hey, hit the one who's
not a US president!

19:42.781 --> 19:44.349
Not a US president.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.753
Come on, that's Abe Lincoln!

19:47.819 --> 19:49.755
- TYLER: Come on, Cory!
You're getting behind!

19:49.821 --> 19:51.723
- [ding]
- Oh, wow!

19:51.790 --> 19:53.625

19:56.061 --> 19:58.730
- COBY: Cody, you're
on to the final stage!

20:00.432 --> 20:02.367
- [buzzer]
- TYLER: That is not correct.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.570
Apparently Cory didn't
take any US history,

20:04.636 --> 20:08.006
'cause he just pummeled my man
on the 20, Andrew Jackson.

20:08.073 --> 20:09.474
Keep going, Cor!

20:09.541 --> 20:11.777
And Cody takes a
commanding lead!

20:14.746 --> 20:15.914
- [ding]

20:15.981 --> 20:18.150
- Yes!
Go, go!

20:19.318 --> 20:22.554
- Walk left, up.
Cody is catching up to you.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.357
Whoever's the first to get all
three words on the board wins.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.327
Number one across, another
name for energy from the sun.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.861
- TYLER: That's amazing.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.630
- COBY: Cory, one
down, two to go.

20:31.697 --> 20:32.898
He takes the lead!

20:32.965 --> 20:35.033
- Code, you gotta pick it up!
What are you doing?

20:35.100 --> 20:36.101
- Oh my gosh.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.803
- TYLER: Solar!
That's right.

20:37.869 --> 20:38.937
- COBY: It's all tied up.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.439
All right, three across.

20:40.505 --> 20:43.742
Direction to the right of
a person facing a sunset.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.577
- TYLER: It is coming down!

20:45.644 --> 20:48.280
Cory takes the lead.
Two down, one to go!

20:48.347 --> 20:50.082
- COBY: Oh, wow.

20:50.148 --> 20:52.584
- Cody's got his second word!

20:52.651 --> 20:55.487
- COBY: The final clue is,
to be of the same opinion.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.156
This is coming down to the wire.
- TYLER: Who wants it more?

20:58.223 --> 20:59.791
- COBY: Agree.
That's it!

20:59.858 --> 21:03.895
- [cheering]

21:03.962 --> 21:05.597
- Oh, wow!

21:05.664 --> 21:07.332
- No!

21:07.399 --> 21:09.968
- Guess that settles it.
Brawn wins over brain.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.070
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it's an honor and a privilege

21:12.137 --> 21:14.272
to give Cory Cotton

21:14.339 --> 21:17.142
the brain versus brawn
championship trophy.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.410
Since you're a brawn man,

21:18.477 --> 21:20.379
you should have no issue
handling that.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.047
There you go, my friend.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.549
Congratulations, Cory!
Raise that proud!

21:24.616 --> 21:26.818
- Keep it high.
Keep it up there!

21:26.885 --> 21:29.521
Raise it high!
- I'll one hand that thing.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.858
- TYLER: Congrtualations!
Very nice.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.159
Okay, let me take that for ya.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.727
Hey, congratulations.
Take a break.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.896
Great job, my friend.
Realy, really proud of you.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.732
- That thing is... light.
- Hey, dont' forget your trophy.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.334
- Can we get, like,
a wheelbarrow?

21:42.401 --> 21:44.169
- No, nope.
You gotta bring it with ya.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.138
You know which one's
not a president?

21:46.204 --> 21:47.606
- You really not know?

21:47.673 --> 21:48.774
- The brown one.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.343
- No, are you kidding?
- That's Roosevelt!

21:51.410 --> 21:53.111
- You know what?
You don't deserve this.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.579
- Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!

21:54.646 --> 21:56.882

21:56.948 --> 21:58.050
