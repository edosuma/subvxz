WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.611
So are you swallowing those
things whole, are you actually

00:11.646 --> 00:13.613
managing to get
a few bites in on the way?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.981
Whole.

00:16.015 --> 00:21.621
I'm heading over
to the cyclotron if that's
okay with my bodyguards.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.424
Sure.
Yeah, that's cool.
Be right behind you.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.826
Thanks, bren.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.797
<laughs>
what's so funny?

00:32.832 --> 00:37.637
"Thanks, bren. " someone
has a crush on you.

00:37.672 --> 00:40.040
Oh, c'mon. She's a sweetie.

00:40.075 --> 00:42.407
<laughs>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.844
can't be easy being
the senator's daughter,
either, right?

00:44.879 --> 00:46.446
Yeah, especially with
her mom having all those death

00:46.481 --> 00:49.214
threats, can't
make life any easier.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.651
Well, i think she's
dealing with it okay.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.618
She's a good kid.

00:53.653 --> 00:56.056
Bren, you've gotta see this one.

00:56.091 --> 01:00.425
<laughing>

01:00.460 --> 01:02.062
maybe next time, kids.

01:02.097 --> 01:04.429
Time to go.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.066
Come on, we're having fun.

01:06.101 --> 01:08.285
Yeah. Come on.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.435
Not from you.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.872
<laughing>
c'mon.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.474
Fine.

01:14.874 --> 01:18.078
Your mom would
be very worried about you
if we brought you home late.

01:18.113 --> 01:20.445
We have our orders.
- Fine.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.082
Then can i ride
on your bike with you?

01:22.117 --> 01:23.283
No, no, no.

01:23.683 --> 01:24.849
Hey, no.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.486
You only ride on four wheels,
which means you and shal get

01:26.886 --> 01:28.488
to go in the car, but you
know, i'll be right behind you.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.890
Why don't you pick
a cd for the way back?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.699 --> 01:42.067
Can i help you guys?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.703
Girlfriend's got a nice car.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.270
Yeah, i know this.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.307
I'm gonna look good driving it.

01:47.342 --> 01:49.309
The girl comes with us.

01:49.344 --> 01:50.910
I don't think so.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.113
Ugh!

01:54.148 --> 01:56.916
Ahh!

01:57.317 --> 01:58.518
What the hell are you?

01:58.918 --> 02:00.920
Wrong people to mess with.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.323
You didn't think you were just
going to get the girl, did you?

02:03.358 --> 02:05.542
Tell me who you're working for.

02:05.577 --> 02:07.727
I'm not going to ask you twice.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.932
Brennan? Brennan!

02:13.333 --> 02:14.499
Stay away!

02:14.534 --> 02:17.337
Brennan, what's happening?
- Brennan?

02:17.372 --> 02:18.938
Get away!

02:18.973 --> 02:20.905
Agh!

02:20.940 --> 02:22.542
Get away!

02:25.745 --> 02:26.511
Brennan!

02:26.546 --> 02:28.113
Agh... aghhhh!

02:28.148 --> 02:32.152
Get the girl before
the whole place goes up!

02:32.952 --> 02:34.519
Brennan, help me!

02:34.554 --> 02:38.158
Please! Brennan! Help, brennan!

02:38.193 --> 02:40.925
Brennan!

02:40.960 --> 02:44.964
Brennan! Fight it!

02:44.999 --> 02:48.585
Agh...!

02:48.620 --> 02:52.172
Ugh!

02:56.976 --> 02:58.578
Jesse! We lost
the senator's daughter.

02:58.613 --> 03:01.381
And prep the lab.
Brennan's down.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.157
I am adam kane.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.595
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

03:15.630 --> 03:18.963
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

03:18.998 --> 03:24.604
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated

03:25.004 --> 03:28.608
and developed
super human abilities.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.400
Together with four
of the most powerful

03:55.435 --> 03:59.839
i fight to protect a world
that doesn't even know we exist.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.843
We are... mutant x.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.386
Adam, you were supposed
to keep her safe.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.753
You were supposed
to take care of her.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.190
Senator, you have my personal
assurance that all my efforts

04:18.591 --> 04:21.793
are focussed
on getting your daughter
back quickly and safely.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.162
We'll be in your office
in less than an hour.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.199
No. I have already turned this
over to a team of investigators,

04:26.234 --> 04:28.619
hired to handle this
kind of investigation.

04:28.654 --> 04:31.004
Getting anybody else
involved at this stage

04:31.039 --> 04:33.006
is the worst thing you can do.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.207
Open your eyes, adam!

04:34.607 --> 04:35.808
Things couldn't be any
worse than they are right now.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.812
I will find her. I promise.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.820
I'm sorry, adam.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.223
That's all right.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.426
There's nothing you
could have done about it.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.793
Oh, what the
hell happened to me?

04:55.828 --> 04:59.032
I won't know until
i finish running some tests.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.635
You know, could've
been a random occurrence.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.438
What?

05:05.838 --> 05:07.805
Random occurrence?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.442
You can't write off shalimar
and me almost being killed

05:09.477 --> 05:16.249
as a random occurrence, adam.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.452
Even if you knew, you
wouldn't tell me, would you?

05:19.852 --> 05:21.454
Brennan, when i
know something definite,

05:21.854 --> 05:24.657
you'll be the next to know.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.870
Hey, what'd adam say?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.072
Nothing, as usual.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.673
He likes keeping
us all in the dark.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.240
But that's not
his style, brennan.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.476
If he knew something
he would tell you.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.277
No, adam's world is
based on having all the facts.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.796
He doesn't have that
with me. That scares him.

05:46.831 --> 05:48.281
Yeah, well, something
like that scares all of us.

05:48.316 --> 05:49.482
Well, you know what scares me?

05:49.517 --> 05:50.648
Megan is in danger.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.884
I was the one who lost it.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.486
It's my fault she got kidnapped.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.652
Our fault.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.888
Yeah, well, you seem
to be doing just fine.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.890
I was the one that
almost killed both of us.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.492
Yeah, well, lucky
for us adam's all over it.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.911
Yeah? We'll see.

06:00.946 --> 06:02.260
You know what?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.496
You and adam are a lot
more alike than either one of

06:03.896 --> 06:05.063
you would care to admit.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.699
Shal, adam's not the one whose
body's falling apart here...

06:06.734 --> 06:08.666
he's on it, bren.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.303
Look, don't lose faith.

06:10.703 --> 06:11.869
Oh, yeah, that's
easy for you to say,

06:11.904 --> 06:13.871
standing in your shoes...
okay, you know what?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.309
I know you're
hurting right now, so i'm
going to let that one go.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.711
But just so
there's no confusion,

06:19.112 --> 06:21.114
let me make one
thing perfectly clear.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.116
If this is about your
mutation taking another step,

06:23.151 --> 06:25.118
then it is about me -
it's about all of us.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.721
And you know what?
I do still have faith.

06:39.932 --> 06:43.536
Think of this as hallowe'en.

06:43.571 --> 06:47.105
All dark and spooky and scary...

06:47.140 --> 06:51.944
for all involved i'm gonna
go to your momma's house and say

06:51.979 --> 06:57.950
"trick or treat". And
if she gives me my treat...

06:58.351 --> 07:04.357
i'll go next door...
and scare the neighbours.

07:04.757 --> 07:12.365
But if she doesn't give me
my treat, i have to do a trick,

07:12.400 --> 07:16.334
a really bad trick.

07:16.369 --> 07:22.775
The one where you end up dead.

07:23.176 --> 07:30.383
So you better hope your
momma's in a generous mood, huh?

07:37.990 --> 07:39.957
Maybe i should talk to him.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.594
I think maybe we
should all have a talk.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.561
What do you mean?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.598
Maybe what's happened to
brennan was supposed to happen.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.366
Maybe his accident
wasn't an accident at all,

07:48.401 --> 07:50.403
but was just the natural
progression of his mutation.

07:50.438 --> 07:51.969
No, that's not true.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.006
Come on. Look,
none of us want anything
bad to happen to brennan.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.973
God, he's closer
than my own family.

07:56.008 --> 08:00.012
But we are all continuing
to mutate, and sooner or later

08:00.413 --> 08:02.014
that mutation's going
to go out of control.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.581
You don't know that.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.618
You're right. I don't
know that. But maybe i'm right.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.585
Maybe we're like a...

08:07.620 --> 08:10.022
like a comet or a light
bulb that burns brightest
right before we die.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.390
Brennan is not dying.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.593
I hope to god you're right.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.630
But right now, adam
doesn't have the answers,

08:18.030 --> 08:20.433
which means that nobody
does, and that's scaring me.

08:20.468 --> 08:23.453
Wha... what?

08:23.488 --> 08:26.439
Did he... um...?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.642
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.861
Of course he did.

08:31.896 --> 08:34.010
Jesse... emma.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.448
Let's go pay the senator
a little office visit.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.451
I thought she
kicked us off the case.

08:38.486 --> 08:40.017
She did.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.455
I don't get fired that easily.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.826
We'll find her.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.664
We're connecting our
system to a high speed tracer.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.631
Adam...? What the hell is this?

08:53.666 --> 08:55.268
I thought i made myself
clear in our last conversation.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.869
You did, senator.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.035
I'm very sorry.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.072
I was just hoping
that you would reconsider.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.074
Let us work in tandem
with your security team.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.676
I'm sorry. I'm adam kane.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.243
Simon fletcher.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.879
Mr. Kane, my agency is
trained to deal with these types

09:06.914 --> 09:09.647
of recoveries,
and we work alone.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.649
Mr. Fletcher, this isn't
a time for a power play.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.086
These people are
about to make their demands
and we have to be ready.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.889
As far as i'm concerned,
you don't have to be anything,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.491
because you're out of here.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.860
Do you need to
be forcibly removed?

09:22.895 --> 09:26.499
Adam, please don't make this
any harder than it already is.

09:26.534 --> 09:28.065
No, sorry, senator.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.503
Our prayers are with you.

09:30.538 --> 09:34.907
Sorry.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.112
I really should send
those guys a thank you note.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.679
They've already
done all the hard work.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.316
You managed to piggyback
the tracing system?

09:43.351 --> 09:45.283
Yeah.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.285
You okay?
- Yeah.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.287
I don't know,
maybe it was just...

09:49.322 --> 09:52.089
there was a lot of really
intense emotions in there.

09:52.124 --> 09:56.128
Well, let's see
if we can get her daughter
back and turn it around.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.931
All right jess, so as far
as we know, we still haven't had

09:59.332 --> 10:01.699
any communication
from the kidnappers, right?

10:01.734 --> 10:03.701
No. But when they do, we'll know
where the call is coming from.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.138
We should have the
kidnappers' exact coordinates
within a few seconds.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.740
Good. And once
we have those, shalimar,

10:08.140 --> 10:10.142
i want you to lead the
team on the rescue effort.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.945
Okay.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.754
Brennan, i want you
to stay here at sanctuary.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.356
I want you to
monitor the situation.

10:23.391 --> 10:24.957
No, i'm going.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.759
I'm afraid that's
just not possible,

10:26.794 --> 10:28.160
not in your current
unstable state.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.727
My "state"?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.364
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

10:31.399 --> 10:32.930
All right, man.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.767
Look, i know you just want
to help, but until we have your

10:34.802 --> 10:36.569
situation under control it's
safer if you just stay here.

10:36.604 --> 10:37.770
Adam, this is not a hospital.

10:37.805 --> 10:38.971
Okay?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.573
And i'm not a patient
or... or a prisoner.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.540
I can help the team.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.176
Adam just doesn't
want you getting hurt.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.743
Oh. Is... is that it?

10:45.778 --> 10:47.380
Or do you just think i'm
going to hurt somebody else?

10:47.780 --> 10:48.981
Right. Now listen to me.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.184
I'm
working on a way to stabilize
your powers at the same

10:52.219 --> 10:55.388
time we've gotta find
a way to find the girl.

10:55.423 --> 10:56.954
And so what?

10:56.989 --> 10:58.991
Meanwhile i'm just supposed
to sit here waiting to die?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.192
Brennan, take it easy.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.794
No. I just want to be
allowed to do my job, jess.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.213
You're hands, bren.

11:03.248 --> 11:04.723
I'm fine. All right.

11:04.758 --> 11:06.198
Brennan... brennan.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.365
No, no.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.001
Listen to me.
You have to concentrate.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.167
I'm fine...

11:10.202 --> 11:11.804
i want you to concentrate.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.970
Agh...!

11:13.005 --> 11:14.206
Brennan. Brennan.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.373
Concentrate!

11:15.408 --> 11:20.212
Brennan, please...
- aghh!

11:20.613 --> 11:22.214
Brennan!

11:42.868 --> 11:45.236
He doesn't look good.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.273
Well, that last episode
took a lot out of him.

11:47.308 --> 11:49.240
He's not the only one.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.876
What in the hell happened, adam?

11:50.911 --> 11:53.279
I don't know.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.682
I do know that right
now he's highly unstable.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.650
What does it mean
for the rest of us, adam?

11:59.685 --> 12:03.689
All right, look, i know
that you're all afraid that your

12:04.090 --> 12:06.092
powers are mutating, but
right now there is no reason to

12:06.127 --> 12:10.096
think that any
of you are in any danger.

12:10.131 --> 12:12.063
Yet.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.065
I am not going to give up here.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.701
I am going to find a way to
stabilize brennan, and i'm going

12:15.736 --> 12:17.703
to make sure that nothing
bad happens to any of you.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.506
You just have to trust me.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.513
I could've killed jesse, adam.

12:27.548 --> 12:30.081
I could've killed any one of us.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.518
And believe me, i am going
to do everything in my power

12:32.553 --> 12:35.321
to make sure that
that doesn't happen.

12:35.356 --> 12:37.323
<sighs> see, i...

12:37.723 --> 12:39.925
i know you're all thinking
about gabriel ashlocke.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.128
You're all wondering
whether or not you're going to

12:42.163 --> 12:43.694
self-destruct
like he did, right?

12:43.729 --> 12:46.532
Why don't you look me
in the eye and tell me that's

12:46.567 --> 12:48.499
not going to happen?

12:48.534 --> 12:51.737
Ashlocke's
genes were at the point
of ripping themselves apart.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.341
Your genes are highly unstable,
but i believe that that is a

12:55.741 --> 12:58.509
result of a
ramping of your power.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.347
And i have to find a
way to allow you to control it.

13:01.382 --> 13:04.550
So what if you don't?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.917
We all just
go up like a big bang?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.355
All right, brennan, right
now you have to learn how to

13:09.755 --> 13:11.757
control your emotions,
because i believe that that is

13:12.158 --> 13:14.125
triggering the problem.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.562
Adam, do you have any idea what
it feels like to walk around

13:16.597 --> 13:18.529
like a living time bomb?

13:18.564 --> 13:20.166
To know that at any
second i could explode and...

13:20.201 --> 13:22.968
and kill shalimar, jesse...

13:23.003 --> 13:24.935
you? Anyone?

13:24.970 --> 13:27.773
I walk around with
these thoughts in my head
every single day and...

13:27.808 --> 13:30.176
and you want me
to control my emotions?

13:30.211 --> 13:32.543
Are you out of your mind?

13:32.578 --> 13:34.945
All right, look, i know i don't
know how you feel, but i do

13:34.980 --> 13:37.383
know
that every time you lose your
temper your power overloads.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.785
So until i can allow you
to restore conscious control,

13:39.820 --> 13:42.953
you have to stay calm.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.791
Stay calm? Adam,
there's a little girl that's
in danger because of me.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.194
Okay, one minute
i go from owning this to...

13:48.229 --> 13:51.397
to feeling my body
tear itself apart...

13:51.797 --> 13:52.998
adam?

13:53.399 --> 13:55.000
Agh...

13:55.035 --> 13:56.567
brennan.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.004
Brennan, i want
you to take a deep breath.

13:59.405 --> 14:05.811
Breathe in. And out.

14:05.846 --> 14:14.985
<gasping>

14:15.020 --> 14:19.425
all right. You okay?

14:19.460 --> 14:21.392
That was good.

14:21.427 --> 14:25.831
No. No, adam.
None of this is good.

14:35.841 --> 14:40.846
<phone rings>
hello?

14:40.881 --> 14:45.816
Senator morrison?

14:45.851 --> 14:47.818
You know why i'm calling.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.855
I want to speak to my daughter.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.857
It's good to have goals.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.859
Do you remember
saying that, senator?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.861
Huh? You remember that?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.828
Yes.

14:57.863 --> 15:01.467
Well, i've set
my goal. Are you ready?

15:01.502 --> 15:04.670
Just tell me what you want.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.674
Your campaign fund
has over $5 million.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.041
You have access to that account.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.479
You can't expect me
to embezzle campaign money?

15:13.514 --> 15:17.883
What? An honest politician?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.084
Mom!

15:19.485 --> 15:22.288
Honest enough to let her
daughter die for principles?

15:22.323 --> 15:26.292
I... i'll do what you ask.

15:26.692 --> 15:30.295
Five million dollars
- in twenty-four hours.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.899
You'll get another
call as to where and when.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.503
Move, senator.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.312
Did you get a
fix on the kidnappers?

15:46.347 --> 15:47.913
Got 'em.
- Where are they?

15:48.314 --> 15:49.880
An old factory downtown.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.917
Well, the helix should
get us there before the cops.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.120
Let's just hope
the show's not over.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.927
You sure about this, jess?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.730
Yeah. The call came from here.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.338
What do you say? Open sesame?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.595
This end's clear.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.962
I got nothing.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.198
Nothing over here, either.

17:13.598 --> 17:17.202
Let's try upstairs.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.793
What the hell is that stuff?

17:42.828 --> 17:46.832
It's a redialer. Relays
the call to a clean line.

17:46.867 --> 17:50.436
Can you find the
location of the kidnappers?

17:50.471 --> 17:52.403
Shouldn't be a problem...

17:52.438 --> 17:55.240
(recorded) trying to
track me was stupid, senator.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.643
You broke the rules.

17:57.678 --> 17:58.809
<beep> uh oh.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.045
Jesse, that's a bomb.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.211
Come on.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.413
I can almost get 'em.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.649
Yeah, and we're almost dead!

18:03.684 --> 18:04.815
Now come on!

18:04.850 --> 18:06.051
I can get him!
- Jesse, come on.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.252
Jess!

18:07.653 --> 18:10.456
Agh... go! Go! Go!

18:29.341 --> 18:30.542
This is all bad.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.344
How did they
know we would be there?

18:32.379 --> 18:33.745
Well, they didn't
know it would be us.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.312
They're smart.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.949
They knew the senator'd
have her lines tapped.

18:36.984 --> 18:38.150
I don't know.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.352
Well, look, we
had to take the shot.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.154
The question
is, what do we do now?

18:48.160 --> 18:51.563
Hey. What you working on?

18:51.598 --> 18:54.967
Nothing. It's nothing.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.370
Come on, it's all right.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.338
Or is it not all right?

19:01.373 --> 19:05.377
Look, it's just with everything
going on right now, and adam...

19:05.412 --> 19:08.981
you know, i just want
to be in the loop here.

19:09.016 --> 19:10.182
Okay?

19:10.582 --> 19:12.184
I hate this whole situation.
I feel totally useless.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.151
All right?

19:14.186 --> 19:16.588
I just want to
be a part of the team.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.354
Please?

19:17.389 --> 19:20.993
Fine. Just don't zap out
or anything.

19:21.393 --> 19:25.797
Yeah. No zapping. Promise.

19:26.198 --> 19:30.602
Okay, you know
senator morrison's head of
security, simon fletcher?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.169
Yeah.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.206
Met him with shalimar
when we first picked up megan.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.608
Right. Well, i
thought i got a funny vibe
from him this afternoon

19:36.643 --> 19:39.011
when i met him at the senator's
office, and then when his

19:39.046 --> 19:41.413
people didn't show
up i got a little suspicious.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.415
So let's check him out.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.982
I already did.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.819
At first glance,
his record seemed perfect.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.639
Until i found this.

19:50.674 --> 19:53.390
It came from seattle.

19:53.425 --> 19:56.228
A governor's son was
kidnapped and held for ransom,

19:56.263 --> 19:59.031
and the head of security
that worked the release was...

19:59.066 --> 20:01.050
simon fletcher.

20:01.085 --> 20:03.000
What happened?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.636
Well, simon was the one
they sent to pay the ransom,

20:05.037 --> 20:08.240
and the kidnappers
were never found.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.843
What about the kid?

20:19.851 --> 20:23.054
Look, i think simon was
in on it, and i think he had

20:23.089 --> 20:26.258
something to do with
megan's kidnapping as well.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.826
Yeah, well, i think i might
have a little chat with him.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.264
I don't think adam's going to
go for that right now, brennan.

20:32.299 --> 20:35.867
(on pa) brennan, could
you come to the lab, please?

20:35.902 --> 20:39.871
Don't want to
keep the boss waiting.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.274
It's going to be okay.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.645
What's up?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.682
Hey. I've developed a theory.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.085
I don't want to hear
theories. I want to hear cures.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.651
All right. Now, look.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.688
Unfortunately, what works
on the level of the microscopic

20:56.723 --> 20:58.255
sample will not
work on you as a whole.

20:58.290 --> 21:06.263
Damn. Why don't you
just admit that i'm dying?

21:06.298 --> 21:13.105
Because i'm not
going to admit that and you
shouldn't even think it.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.107
I don't believe you, adam.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.474
You don't even believe yourself.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.111
I fought for you
and what you stood for.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.078
But what you did to us...

21:21.113 --> 21:24.716
adam, i accepted my
fate and i made it my own,

21:24.751 --> 21:26.283
but you lied to us.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.919
I'm not doing
it your way any more.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.486
Listen, i can help you.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.523
I just don't want to
put you in any more danger.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.125
Now, why can't
you understand that?

21:33.160 --> 21:34.726
I am not going to let you die!

21:34.761 --> 21:35.892
It's too late!

21:35.927 --> 21:37.529
Okay? I'm sorry, i got
something i gotta do.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.096
All right.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.332
Anything you do you
put yourself in danger,

21:40.367 --> 21:41.898
do you understand that?

21:41.933 --> 21:45.937
The reality is, adam,
i got nothing to lose.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.746
Hey, em, i just saw
brennan tear out of here.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.149
You know what that's all about?

21:57.184 --> 22:00.717
I screwed up.

22:00.752 --> 22:04.356
I told him my suspicions
about simon fletcher.

22:04.756 --> 22:09.161
I'm pretty sure
i know where he went.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.975
You're a hard man to find.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.942
I know you.

22:25.977 --> 22:27.979
You're one of the people that
lost the senator's daughter.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.981
Well, then we have
something in common,

22:30.382 --> 22:33.550
seeing as you're
the one that kidnapped her.

22:33.585 --> 22:38.390
Oh, yeah. You got me.
I kidnapped my boss's daughter.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.757
Nice try, freak. Get lost.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.794
Hey!
- Governor nelson's son,
four years ago.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.361
Ring any bells?

22:44.396 --> 22:46.398
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.166
Now, see, that's a lie.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.203
I hate it when people lie to me.

22:51.238 --> 22:52.369
What is that?

22:52.404 --> 22:53.605
This is how i figure it.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.607
You're too stupid to
have set this up on your own,

22:55.642 --> 22:57.209
but you're just greedy
enough to have set up that

22:57.244 --> 22:58.810
little girl for
a piece of the ransom.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.412
And you're going to tell
me who your partner is and where

23:00.812 --> 23:02.414
i can find him, and
you're gonna tell me now.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.233
Who's your partner?

23:04.268 --> 23:05.982
I can't. He'll kill me.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.820
Don't worry about your
partner. Worry about me.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.623
What the hell is that?

23:12.023 --> 23:15.192
It's something i can't control.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.029
You got about ten seconds before
i light up like old sparky.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.397
Is that how you
were looking to go?

23:20.432 --> 23:22.033
Okay. Okay, the
guy's name is christian.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.237
Where... and when...

23:25.637 --> 23:27.604
god.

23:27.639 --> 23:28.805
Tonight. Eight o'clock.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.442
I gotta deliver the
money by eight o'clock.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.043
A warehouse by the
dock. The girl is there.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.045
Don't kill me.

23:34.080 --> 23:42.053
Aghh...

23:46.858 --> 23:48.460
hey, brennan.

23:48.860 --> 23:53.665
Hey... hey. You still with us?

23:54.065 --> 23:58.835
I think so.

23:58.870 --> 24:02.874
That is by far the dumbest
move you have ever made.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.443
Is he dead?

24:06.478 --> 24:08.880
No. We're bringing him with us.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.449
Bringing him where?

24:12.484 --> 24:14.886
Back to sanctuary, brennan.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.254
Back to adam.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.691
And i'm not asking you to
come with me, i'm telling you.

24:19.726 --> 24:25.697
Look, i know you're
scared. We all are.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.900
I don't care
about that any more.

24:28.935 --> 24:34.506
What i do care about is you.

24:34.541 --> 24:39.676
I'm sorry.

24:39.711 --> 24:48.119
But at least you're consistent
- did he tell you where megan is?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.522
Yeah, he told me everything.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.690
Fill me in on the way.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.493
And let adam take
care of you, brennan.

24:56.528 --> 25:00.096
Look, he says he has
a fix, and you have to try it.

25:00.131 --> 25:04.936
Okay, whatever he
works out for you just might
end up saving all of us.

25:04.971 --> 25:10.942
Can you walk?

25:11.343 --> 25:14.110
Absolutely.

25:14.145 --> 25:20.552
Good. You get
to carry the bad guy.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.159
I can't believe simon
actually knew what was going on.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.361
Oh, he's done it before.

25:29.761 --> 25:30.962
So he knows where megan is?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.529
That's right. He does.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.165
And now we do,
and we're ready to move.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.732
Okay?

25:35.767 --> 25:36.968
Well, simon said that
he'd be calling any minute,

25:37.369 --> 25:38.970
so i want you to pretend
like you know nothing.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.574
I want you to go along
with whatever they say.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.194
<phone rings>

25:45.229 --> 25:47.779
answer it.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.181
Hello?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.148
Ah, hi.

25:52.183 --> 25:54.586
I take it all the necessary
lessons have been learned.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.588
Is my daughter okay?

25:56.988 --> 25:58.990
I've
managed to vent my frustrations
in a more productive

25:59.025 --> 26:02.811
way, senator,
but i assure you...

26:02.846 --> 26:06.523
one more mistake
- one more mistake!

26:06.558 --> 26:10.201
- And i will do
much more than hurt her.

26:10.602 --> 26:14.170
Okay, listen.

26:14.205 --> 26:18.975
You bring your head
of security to warehouse 16,

26:19.010 --> 26:24.616
by the docks, at eight
in the morning... with my money.

26:24.651 --> 26:29.020
If he is one minute
late, your daughter dies.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.589
You understand?

26:32.624 --> 26:35.026
I... i thought you
only wanted to deal with me.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.028
<laughing>, yeah, well, i...

26:37.429 --> 26:39.796
you... you've disobeyed
me once already.

26:39.831 --> 26:44.636
Perhaps your employee
will follow directions better.

26:47.839 --> 26:50.441
He wants simon to make the drop.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.761
What are we going to do now?

26:52.796 --> 26:55.046
He doesn't know we have simon.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.613
So we follow that plan.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.050
And simon opens the door for us.

26:59.085 --> 27:02.619
Senator... you don't worry.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.457
You'll have your
daughter back by tomorrow.

27:24.676 --> 27:27.043
What is going on?

27:27.078 --> 27:29.045
Well, there's a strange
smell in the air, kiddo.

27:29.080 --> 27:37.489
I have a
feeling i'm not the only one
playing tricks out there.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.856
What are you doing?

27:39.891 --> 27:42.258
Buying myself
a little insurance.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.497
Your new necklace is packed with
a half pound of c4 explosive.

27:45.897 --> 27:49.501
Because if anything
goes wrong with the switch,

27:49.901 --> 27:57.909
momma's little girl
is going home without a head.

28:12.657 --> 28:15.060
So, do you understand exactly
what it is we're about to do?

28:15.095 --> 28:17.462
Yeah. I do my thing.
Emma does her thing.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.263
Something like that.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.630
Well, not exactly.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.868
Okay. I light up and
lose it, emma links up with me

28:23.903 --> 28:26.888
telempathically
to help me reboot, right?

28:26.923 --> 28:29.874
So, what? Is that
the technical explanation?

28:29.909 --> 28:31.441
Well, why don't you tell me,

28:31.476 --> 28:33.443
because i don't see
how this is going to work.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.880
Look, i'm just going to try
and get you to help yourself.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.447
Exactly.

28:37.482 --> 28:40.685
I want you to think of this
as a telempathic booster shot.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.652
Wait... wait.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.689
What are you saying, that
this is just mind over matter?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.256
Yeah, something like that.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.293
Your body is mutating faster
than your mind has the capacity

28:48.693 --> 28:50.660
to process the change.

28:50.695 --> 28:55.500
Let's get the two to catch up.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.067
Exactly.

28:57.102 --> 28:58.703
That is the idea.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.305
You ready with this?

29:00.340 --> 29:03.073
Here we go.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.910
You sure you're ready for this?

29:05.945 --> 29:09.914
Ask me once it's over.

29:10.315 --> 29:14.319
Okay. Let's get started.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.300
Here we go.

29:30.335 --> 29:35.940
Good. Keep going.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.109
This doesn't look safe.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.745
I think we should stop them.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.364
Couldn't if you wanted to.

29:42.399 --> 29:43.948
Emma insisted on doing it.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.316
Now?

29:46.351 --> 29:48.953
Not yet, emma.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.674
Aggh... aghhh...!

29:52.709 --> 29:56.361
Okay, emma. Now!

30:03.168 --> 30:05.570
Emma, help him focus.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.986
Focus!

30:23.588 --> 30:24.789
What's happening?

30:25.190 --> 30:27.192
I think it's working.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.204
<coughing>

30:40.405 --> 30:41.606
hey, you all
right? You all right?

30:41.641 --> 30:44.374
Hey, you okay?
You okay?

30:44.409 --> 30:47.212
Yeah. Let's not do that again.

30:47.612 --> 30:48.813
Well, maybe you won't have to.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.415
Hey, brennan.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.817
Hey.

30:53.218 --> 30:56.020
How do you feel?

30:56.055 --> 30:58.788
Let's find out.

30:58.823 --> 31:02.827
Wait, you sure you're
ready for a test run there?

31:02.862 --> 31:08.032
What do you think, emma?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.845
Whaddaya say we go
find the senator's daughter?

31:23.248 --> 31:24.449
Better not screw up.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.015
We're serious.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.617
Serious as a heart attack.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.619
You let those kidnappers
know anything's going on,

31:29.654 --> 31:31.656
there'll be
about a half million volts
running through your chest,

31:31.691 --> 31:33.658
you understand?

31:34.058 --> 31:37.262
I understand.

31:44.869 --> 31:50.475
Okay. Here's your ransom
money. You know what to do.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.278
Let's go.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.887
What was that you
strapped to his chest?

32:02.922 --> 32:04.088
Oh, hell if i know.

32:04.489 --> 32:07.091
Some adhesive tape
and old computer parts.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.694
Butt he doesn't know
that, right good work.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.876
All right, shal.

32:26.911 --> 32:28.878
Cover the floor from up here.

32:28.913 --> 32:30.915
And give us any updates
on what's going on.

32:30.950 --> 32:34.118
We'll find our own ways in.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.498
Right on time.

32:48.533 --> 32:52.937
Can i assume we have
no unexpected problems?

32:52.972 --> 32:57.342
Everything is running
exactly as... as planned.

32:57.377 --> 33:00.144
Put the money on the table.

33:13.358 --> 33:18.563
I said put the
money on the table.

33:18.598 --> 33:20.565
Now!

33:29.374 --> 33:31.776
Open it.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.788
Nice to see senator morrison
still knows all the right

33:43.823 --> 33:47.792
strings to pull when
her back's against the wall.

33:47.827 --> 33:50.560
I'm gonna go get the girl.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.398
I'm afraid there's
been a slight change of plan.

33:53.798 --> 33:57.401
Change of plans?

33:57.436 --> 34:00.622
I'm going in.

34:00.657 --> 34:03.808
We're on our way.

34:06.611 --> 34:07.777
We have a deal.

34:07.812 --> 34:11.014
The deal is over.
- Time to renegotiate.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.216
Brennan, help!

34:28.632 --> 34:32.601
Take one more step... go on.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.440
Take one step closer and
the senator's precious daughter

34:35.475 --> 34:39.043
loses everything...
from the neck up.

34:39.078 --> 34:42.063
Brennan, help!

34:42.098 --> 34:45.049
Please, help me!

34:52.123 --> 34:53.724
You got what
you want. Let her go.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.326
Little late for
that now, don't you think?

34:55.726 --> 34:56.928
Come on, man, she's just a kid.

34:56.963 --> 34:58.494
Help!

34:58.529 --> 35:00.531
Nah, better she finds
out sooner than later.

35:00.566 --> 35:05.336
Life doesn't
come with many breaks.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.938
<screaming>

35:07.338 --> 35:10.942
tell me about it.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.145
Ugh... no...!

35:20.551 --> 35:21.717
No, no, no.

35:21.752 --> 35:22.954
Don't touch. Don't touch.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.321
Don't touch.

35:25.356 --> 35:29.760
Sure enough. The device
has a hair trigger mechanism.

35:30.161 --> 35:32.128
If i try to take
it off it could detonate.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.966
Please get this off
of me. I don't want to die.

35:35.001 --> 35:37.185
Megan, we're not
going to let that happen.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.370
Jesse, why can't
you phase it off her?

35:39.770 --> 35:45.376
The mechanism acts with
electrostatic impulses given off

35:45.411 --> 35:47.343
by our own bodies.

35:47.378 --> 35:49.380
If i try to take
it off it'll blow.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.382
Yeah, but there's gotta be a
back door on that thing, right?

35:51.782 --> 35:53.784
If there is, i couldn't find it.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.152
Wait. What if
i create a safe zone?

35:56.187 --> 36:00.191
Fill
the area with the same low-grade
electrostatic impulses?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.002
It could give me the
second i need to take it off.

36:11.402 --> 36:12.568
A second is all we need.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.205
No! You don't
know what you're doing.

36:14.605 --> 36:15.806
<crying> there
has to be another way.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.373
Sh... it's okay.

36:17.408 --> 36:20.010
Listen to me. Listen
to me. You have to trust me.

36:20.045 --> 36:22.613
I am not going to let
anything happen to you, okay?

36:23.014 --> 36:25.416
Yeah.

36:25.816 --> 36:29.420
You ready?

36:50.641 --> 36:53.044
Is this the safe
zone you're talking about?

36:53.079 --> 36:55.046
I guess we're going to find out.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.854
Now, jess.

37:17.868 --> 37:21.072
He shoots, he scores.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.880
Okay?

37:41.892 --> 37:44.260
Adam, thank you.

37:44.295 --> 37:47.898
Words are a poor substitute
to describe what i feel inside.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.266
And believe me, i understand.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.703
Simon fletcher pled
guilty to all charges.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.906
I guess that should
make me feel happy, right?

37:55.941 --> 37:58.274
I guess. How's megan?

37:58.309 --> 38:00.676
Oh, she's amazing
under the circumstances.

38:00.711 --> 38:04.715
I think she worries about
me as much as i worry about her.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.518
Tell bren i said
thanks, will you, mr. Kane?

38:07.918 --> 38:09.920
Yeah, well, i think
you just told him yourself.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.723
Hey, kiddo. Glad
to hear you're all right.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.727
So you'll take me
to the science centre again?

38:16.762 --> 38:18.947
Heh... it's a date.

38:18.982 --> 38:21.097
Thanks again, adam.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.335
Yeah, you bet.
She's a sweet kid.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.901
Yeah.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.538
Terrific mother.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.140
Kid's got a lot
to be grateful for.

38:30.175 --> 38:32.260
Seems to be a lot
of that going around.

38:32.295 --> 38:34.120
I'm grateful just
to be standing here.

38:34.155 --> 38:35.946
Well, you got
a new lease on life?

38:36.347 --> 38:38.314
You tell me.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.716
Is that what i've got?

38:40.751 --> 38:42.753
Come on, adam,
you can level with me.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.156
Well, you want
me to level with you?

38:45.191 --> 38:47.923
Yeah.
- All right.

38:47.958 --> 38:51.162
Emma helped you dodge
one hell of a bullet last night.

38:51.197 --> 38:53.164
Oh, man, you
don't have to tell me.

38:53.199 --> 38:55.583
No, i do have to tell you.

38:55.618 --> 38:57.968
Because the truth is...

38:58.369 --> 39:01.171
i can't even
predict which one of you's
going to be the next one

39:01.206 --> 39:03.974
to mutate out of control, much
less how i'm going to treat it.

39:04.009 --> 39:07.578
Oh, that's... that's gotta
make you feel pretty helpless.

39:07.613 --> 39:11.982
Yeah. It does. Okay?

39:12.383 --> 39:14.385
Because i'm supposed to
be the guy with all the answers,

39:14.420 --> 39:16.352
and i don't have 'em.

39:16.387 --> 39:17.953
And until i do, i can't rest,

39:17.988 --> 39:20.791
until i know exactly
what makes all of you tick.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.795
Oh, yeah, hopefully
what keeps us all ticking.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.762
Yeah, that too.

39:26.797 --> 39:31.602
Well, listen. Thank you, adam.

39:32.002 --> 39:36.407
Hey, i'm not the one
who deserves the thanks.

39:36.442 --> 39:42.012
Oh.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.437
I hope i'm not
shocking your chakra.

40:06.472 --> 40:09.605
Come in.

40:09.640 --> 40:14.044
So, i just wanted to come by
and tell you that i thought you

40:14.445 --> 40:17.248
were pretty terrific last night.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.451
Are you sure you don't
have that the other way around?

40:20.486 --> 40:23.254
Emma, if it wasn't for you
i wouldn't be here right now.

40:23.289 --> 40:25.621
I doubt that very much.

40:25.656 --> 40:29.260
Please - you saved my
life and i will never forget it.

40:29.295 --> 40:32.280
Why did you do it?

40:32.315 --> 40:35.231
I mean, you had...

40:35.266 --> 40:36.867
you had no idea
what could've happened.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.469
You could've died.

40:38.869 --> 40:40.471
Look, it's not like
i have a choice, brennan.

40:40.506 --> 40:42.438
I mean, we're
all in the same boat.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.475
What do you think you
would've done if it was my power

40:44.510 --> 40:46.877
spinning out of
control? Run and hide?

40:47.278 --> 40:54.084
Well, it's always an
option. Just not our style.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.888
No, we stick together
'til the bitter end.

40:57.923 --> 41:01.257
All right, so let
me ask you all a question.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.495
Which
one of you actually thought
that i was buying my last

41:04.895 --> 41:08.098
ticket out of here?

41:12.503 --> 41:14.505
You kidding? Thought
never crossed our mind, man.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.524
Yeah, we knew you'd bounce back.

41:16.559 --> 41:18.509
Never doubted it for a minute.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.876
Hm, really?

41:20.911 --> 41:24.114
<laughing> you
guys are lousy liars.

41:24.149 --> 41:32.122
<laughing> weli... thanks.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.726
So... you really all right, man?

41:35.761 --> 41:37.328
Yeah, yeah, i'm good, man.
