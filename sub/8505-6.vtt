WEBVTT

00:08.009 --> 00:09.635
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.719 --> 00:10.886
It's drawn to you.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.013
Calling me.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.889
Wait! Jason!

00:13.973 --> 00:16.142
Oh, my God.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.060
I know where Jane Scott's body is.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.645
- Where's Peggy?
- Carter?

00:19.729 --> 00:21.313
She's moved on to a new case.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.107
You're yesterday's news for her.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.317
<i>I need your help.
It called me here.</i>

00:25.401 --> 00:26.569
It wants to be let out.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.571
- Should you really be touching her?
- Yes. I have to.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.239
I need an atomic bomb.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.907
The two remaining warheads
were put in storage.

00:31.991 --> 00:34.368
Well, it won't be the first time
we've infiltrated a Roxxon facility.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.662
<i>The elevator
requires a special key.</i>

00:36.829 --> 00:39.248
Talk Mr Jarvis through the procedure.
I'll take care of our company.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.463
<i>You said you moved here
because you wanted a fresh start,</i>

00:45.546 --> 00:46.797
but that's not the whole truth, is it?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.340
I think you're in love with Peggy.

00:48.424 --> 00:51.010
<i>Get the Council together.
I want to call an emergency meeting.</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:52.303
They're gonna want to hear this.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.097
- Peggy, I...
- Jason! Jason!

01:06.233 --> 01:07.735
Jason!

01:08.152 --> 01:09.862
Can you hear me?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.877
Can you hear me?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.128
Can you hear me?

01:26.212 --> 01:28.130
Jason? Jason?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.550
What happened?

01:32.676 --> 01:34.136
I... I don't know.
I was somewhere else.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.304
I don't know.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.722
- It's all right. You're back now.
- No, it...

01:36.806 --> 01:38.015
It's not all right.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.725
I can't... I can't fight it any more.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.018
I've lost control, Peggy.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.520
- We'll fix this.
- No! No.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.313
I'm at the whim of some dark force

01:44.396 --> 01:46.190
that we have
absolutely no understanding of.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.150
I could vanish forever at any moment,

01:48.526 --> 01:50.861
and we'd have no idea when
or what would happen next...

01:50.945 --> 01:52.404
What do we know?

01:53.572 --> 01:56.117
Your work at Isodyne
was in containment research.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.160
You built a housing unit for Zero Matter.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.287
Perhaps you can do something similar
for yourself.

02:00.371 --> 02:01.580
- That won't work.
- Why?

02:01.664 --> 02:02.832
Because I have no mass.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.583
I have no material form to contain.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.751
- But if you did?
- If I did,

02:05.835 --> 02:07.461
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.047
Jane Scott's tissue sample.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.174
When you were exposed
to the Zero Matter from that,

02:12.258 --> 02:13.843
you were restored to a tangible state.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.095
- Temporarily.
- If you could replicate that,

02:16.178 --> 02:17.471
even briefly,

02:17.721 --> 02:20.182
do you think you could build
a containment chamber for yourself?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.228
Yes.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.063
Yes, I think that might work.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.150
We need to get our hands
on some more Zero Matter.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.317
And as far as we know,

02:30.401 --> 02:32.069
there's only one place
left in the world to find it.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.740
And I did it.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.993
But then it went away,
but I will get it back.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.870
Darling, are you okay?

02:42.705 --> 02:44.123
Do I look like I'm okay?

02:44.373 --> 02:45.541
- Sweetheart, I was...
- No.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.793
No, what exactly
has happened as of late, Cal,

02:47.877 --> 02:49.336
that would lead you to believe
that I'm okay?

02:49.420 --> 02:51.380
- Whitney, please.
- Would it be the catastrophe,

02:51.922 --> 02:53.632
maybe, at the Roxxon facility?

02:54.133 --> 02:56.343
Or maybe you're referring
to the never-ending interference

02:56.427 --> 02:59.013
of that twit federal agent

02:59.096 --> 03:03.058
and how she has crippled everything
that I am trying to accomplish.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.144
- Honey, everything's gonna be fine.
- How can you say that?

03:05.269 --> 03:07.938
Because I've arranged
for the Council to meet with you.

03:08.731 --> 03:09.940
What did you say?

03:10.316 --> 03:12.443
I thought long and hard about it
through the night,

03:13.068 --> 03:15.905
and I realised that I haven't been
giving you the proper support.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.366
And this is my way
of rectifying my mistake.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.785
But the Council
never meets with outsiders,

03:21.911 --> 03:22.995
let alone a woman.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.371
It took some convincing,

03:24.455 --> 03:25.998
and I did have to cash in all my chips.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.625
But you're worth it.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.961
You've always understood this stuff
better than me.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.549
That's why you need to be the one that
addresses the Council on Zero Matter

03:35.633 --> 03:36.926
and all its potential.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.555
- You did that for me?
- I did it for us.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.891
Now, everyone's
gonna be in attendance

03:43.974 --> 03:45.517
tomorrow night for the fundraiser.

03:45.768 --> 03:49.104
I think once the Council sees
what you're capable of,

03:50.064 --> 03:53.192
well,
they'll give you whatever you want.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.028
Oh, Cal.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.531
Oh, thank you.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.243
Of course, my love.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.375
- Does that go through your body?
- It does, which is fortunate.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.835
Yes. Less likely to infect.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.255
You must be in incredible pain.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.756
Only when I walk.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.675
And sleep. And breathe.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.884
- And eat.
- Ah, yes.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.177
Eating was very unpleasant.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.012
This is all very frightening.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.516
I suffered this injury
while avoiding something far worse,

04:25.599 --> 04:26.642
if you can believe that.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.102
I cannot.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.561
- Well done.
- Thank you.

04:32.523 --> 04:33.899
Where are you going?

04:33.983 --> 04:35.359
To change, and then down to the lab.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.319
I'll find Dr Wilkes
and begin preparations

04:37.403 --> 04:39.738
- for tomorrow evening.
- Shouldn't you be resting?

04:39.822 --> 04:41.198
Ah, in a perfect world.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.325
But sadly, there's no rest
for the weary and wounded

04:43.409 --> 04:44.618
until the job is done.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.288
I'll be up for tea, darling.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.922
Ooh!

04:59.758 --> 05:01.218
You look terrible.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.305
Says the woman with a rebar hole
through her abdomen.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.224
Is anything the matter?

05:08.892 --> 05:12.229
You didn't call me here
to ask me about my emotional state.

05:12.688 --> 05:13.731
Right.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.692
Yes, I called you here
because we have a problem.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.068
Just one?

05:19.111 --> 05:21.113
Dr Wilkes has lost his foothold here.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.157
Last night, he disappeared temporarily,

05:23.574 --> 05:25.826
and now he could vanish forever
at any moment.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.786
We need to do something
to anchor him into this world

05:27.911 --> 05:29.330
until we find a more permanent solution.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.790
Whatever that something is,
it's already giving me indigestion.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.668
Daniel, not only
is Dr Wilkes a good man,

05:34.752 --> 05:37.087
he is the centrepiece for the case
we're building against Isodyne,

05:37.171 --> 05:39.340
Whitney Frost,
and that Arena Social Cabal.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.550
So you need him.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.177
We need him.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.679
All right. What's the plan?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.349
Dr Wilkes has designed
a containment chamber

05:48.432 --> 05:49.600
to stabilise himself,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.226
but he needs a sample of Zero Matter.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.312
I intend to get that sample
from Whitney Frost.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.149
- Okay.
- The best chance that we have

05:57.232 --> 05:58.901
of getting close to Whitney
without being detected

05:58.984 --> 06:00.527
is her husband's campaign fundraiser

06:00.611 --> 06:02.446
tomorrow night
at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.989
Not an easy ticket to get.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.367
Howard Stark donates money
to all the political candidates

06:06.450 --> 06:08.577
to ensure good favour
with whomever wins,

06:08.702 --> 06:11.455
so Mr Jarvis has two tickets secured.

06:11.789 --> 06:12.998
Of course he does.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.752
We can modify
this vacuum syringe from the SSR

06:16.835 --> 06:18.379
to get the sample of Zero Matter.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.755
We use the crowd to our advantage,

06:19.838 --> 06:21.673
we get close enough
to puncture her skin,

06:21.840 --> 06:23.842
and then we make a hasty exit
without any fuss.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.013
- You're gonna do this?
- Yes.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.556
You, who can barely walk?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.059
You, who Whitney's tried to kill
within the past 48 hours?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.144
You, who Whitney will see coming
a mile away,

06:34.353 --> 06:35.729
same as Jarvis, by the way.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.815
Well, someone else, then.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.066
Who? Me?

06:39.775 --> 06:41.402
I'm not gonna fly as Jarvis' date.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.611
Rose, then.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.571
She's on a flight home.
Her mother's sick.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.864
Well, maybe...

06:45.948 --> 06:47.825
We can't trust anybody at the SSR.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.284
That's become painfully clear.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.787
And I'm not about to send a civilian
into the jaws of that lion

06:51.870 --> 06:53.038
without sufficient training.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.417
No, what you need
is a highly-skilled, unknown face

06:56.500 --> 06:58.794
who can blend in with the glamour
and throw down in the gutter.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.088
I don't know anybody besides you
who can pull that off.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.218
I have a terrible idea.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.513
Underwood,

07:09.596 --> 07:11.932
Dr Wexford is here
to conduct your psych evaluation.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.394
Show him in.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.820
Hello, Dr Wexford.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.284
You can leave us.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.995
Are you sure? This one's a handful.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.997
Don't worry. I have protection.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.374
Now, please, some privacy.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.668
We have a lot to talk about.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
Oh, Peg, you're hurt.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.477
You're real hurt.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.189
I thought you'd like to know

08:00.272 --> 08:03.025
that we've received no contact
from the Soviet government

08:03.108 --> 08:05.402
or anyone claiming to be affiliated
to Leviathan,

08:06.111 --> 08:07.446
asking for your release.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.531
This is my surprised face.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.286
Considering this will be your home
for the foreseeable future,

08:14.369 --> 08:15.704
perhaps you should start decorating.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.623
It takes more than six walls to hold me.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.250
- Six?
- We're in a cube, Peggy.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.418
Try to keep up.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.254
I admire your confidence.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.215
Seeing you gives me a real boost.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.425
- How do you mean?
- Well, let's see.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.722
You came here in disguise,
not in official SSR capacity.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.975
That means you don't want
this visit on the record,

08:37.059 --> 08:40.062
which means you're probably
going behind someone's back.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.190
How naughty.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.527
So, if you're not here
to interrogate me officially

08:46.610 --> 08:49.655
and you've gone to such great lengths
to hide the fact that you came at all,

08:51.114 --> 08:54.159
I think the reason for your visit
is pretty obvious.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.373
You need my help.

09:00.541 --> 09:04.628
Now, gently thread
the wire around the base conductor

09:04.711 --> 09:06.213
to generate the magnetic field.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.965
Exceptional work.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.592
Every detail matters
in both art and science.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.469
Precision is key.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.514
We'll just need to set one more coil
and we're finished.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.560
I have to say, this whole thing
has me entirely on edge.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.894
Mmm...

09:20.978 --> 09:24.898
The situation is not ideal,
but Miss Carter is very determined.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.235
Oh, I believe in Peggy, but...
So much can go wrong.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.196
I mean, they're going deep
behind enemy lines,

09:31.280 --> 09:32.656
I mean, basically
surrounding themselves

09:32.739 --> 09:34.116
so they can get as close as possible

09:34.199 --> 09:36.493
to perhaps
the most dangerous person alive.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.496
But there will be reinforcements, yes?

09:39.580 --> 09:40.789
Not to my knowledge, no.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.166
Pretty much everything
has to go perfectly or else...

09:45.752 --> 09:47.129
I'm sure it'll be fine.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.964
Ana!

09:49.673 --> 09:50.716
Oh.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.844
Do you know
where my formal ivory cuff links are?

09:54.052 --> 09:56.013
- Top right drawer on the vanity.
- Ah!

09:56.638 --> 09:58.056
Yes, thank you.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.143
Need to look my best.
A lot of responsibility this evening.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.519
Quite invigorating, really.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.229
Leading a mission,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.023
being right in the thick of the action.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.776
So sorry.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.988
That's all right. We can pull out the wire
and thread a new coil.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.032
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.452
Darling, are you all right?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.203
Yes.

10:20.662 --> 10:21.955
Fine.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.462
Oh, gosh.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.921
Still?

10:32.049 --> 10:34.217
Why were you trying to steal this
from the vault in New York?

10:34.926 --> 10:38.263
Maybe I was hired to steal it.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.807
Maybe the pin is not just a pin.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.560
Maybe that pin unlocks the secrets

10:43.644 --> 10:47.397
to every major decision
made in this cesspool of a country.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.277
Maybe it just matched my blouse.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.154
Play coy if you like,

10:54.237 --> 10:57.032
but we both want something
from the men that wear those pins.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.410
And I'm going to break you out of here
to help me get it.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.871
Is that right?

11:02.954 --> 11:04.623
As you astutely pointed out,

11:04.706 --> 11:07.000
I'm not authorised
to offer you a deal at the moment.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.462
However, once we're through
and I've removed the red tape,

11:10.796 --> 11:13.173
we can work on negotiating
your deportation.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.550
Sounds fun.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.010
I'm in.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.261
Well, that was easy.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.472
What can I say? I'm a giver.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.769
Just so we're clear,
I know you'll try to run,

11:26.311 --> 11:27.604
and I'm prepared for it.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.774
Just so we're clear,
I know your deportation offer is a lie,

11:30.857 --> 11:33.276
and you can never be fully prepared
for me.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.612
Then we're in agreement.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.406
You'll help me get what I need,

11:37.489 --> 11:39.366
and then I'll lock you back up
in this cell.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.662
Use this to get through the door.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.959
Simple as that, is it?

11:49.543 --> 11:53.255
I'd call it intermediate
for a smart girl like you.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.550
I'll handle the guards.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.219
You just follow my trail
up to the ground level.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.930
Um, no window shopping.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.104
When you get outside, go right.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.945
Miss me?

12:17.988 --> 12:19.531
See you at dinner.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.161
Sweet dreams.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.206
Oh, Peggy, you're no fun at all.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.213
Huh.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.100
You thought this would stop me?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.061
No, but I thought this might.

13:40.946 --> 13:41.988
You happy?

13:42.197 --> 13:43.365
Very.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.304
I can't hear you.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.516
Right. Yes, sorry about that.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.017
Apology not accepted.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.061
Allow me to explain the situation.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.566
We have this exquisite diamond choker

14:17.899 --> 14:20.694
which will complete your ensemble
for this evening.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.072
How fabulous.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.158
I'll be sure to return the favour
with a choker of my own someday.

14:29.077 --> 14:32.122
The necklace is equipped
with a tracking device

14:32.664 --> 14:35.959
so that I can monitor your location
at all times.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.003
And if you attempt to remove the beacon

14:38.086 --> 14:40.338
or break even one link in the chain,

14:40.422 --> 14:42.966
you will be injected with a neurotoxin

14:43.049 --> 14:47.429
which will kill you
in 35 excruciatingly painful seconds.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.265
Oh, good. She's awake.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.392
Miss Underwood.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.144
Jeeves.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.692
I was just wondering what type
of firearm I'd be carrying this evening.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.152
Uh, that would be "no type."

15:02.235 --> 15:03.320
You can't be serious.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
If I give you a gun,
she's only going to take it from you.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.198
I take deep offence at that remark.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.993
And I don't see how you'll feel safe
sending me out with

15:10.702 --> 15:12.621
her, unarmed.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.331
Where's your wristwatch?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.583
It's a wristwatch, Miss Carter.
It's on my...

15:17.250 --> 15:19.377
Oh. I, uh...

15:24.799 --> 15:25.967
Sorry.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.346
- Fine.
- Hmm.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.597
A knife, then.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.601
Or a cane with a sword hidden inside.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.061
Oh...

15:36.728 --> 15:38.688
Excuse me for one moment.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.415
- You almost ready?
- Ugh. No.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.542
I can't go.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.252
What do you mean you can't go?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.505
You're gonna have to reschedule
the meeting.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.798
Sweetheart, that's not possible.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.258
Please, just another time, any time.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.761
A smaller venue
or something more private, please.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.179
Whitney, these men do not reschedule.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.931
The Council
does not give second chances.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.600
I cannot be seen in public like this.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.311
The press will have a field day with me.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.105
I look like a circus sideshow.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.360
Hold on.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.035
Here. Put this on.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.717
It's perfect.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.385
You look wonderful.

16:52.971 --> 16:56.433
I have not felt butterflies like this
in so long.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.435
Oh, thank you.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.147
And I'll thank you properly later.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.443
Can't wait.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.574
This is your target.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.908
Do you recognise her?

17:15.452 --> 17:16.703
Can't say that I do.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.413
Her name is Whitney Frost.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.914
She's a rather famous movie actress,

17:19.998 --> 17:22.208
star of <i>The F Stands for Freedom.</i>

17:22.292 --> 17:24.377
Doesn't sound like my kind of picture.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.797
I'm more interested in your new beau.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.425
Hi, handsome.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.469
- Hello.
- Don't talk to her.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.803
Aren't you protective?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.972
Don't be shy, little puppy.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.599
Come on over here. Join us.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.808
Keep focus here.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.810
You'll be obtaining a blood sample
from Miss Frost,

17:40.894 --> 17:42.771
and you will do so
without being detected.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.105
- Is that it?
- Don't be cocky.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.899
Frost is far more dangerous
than she looks,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.526
and I cannot stress this enough,
do not let her touch you.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.696
Fine. No touching.

17:52.781 --> 17:56.034
Dr Wilkes designed this device
to administer a fast extraction.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.536
You depress the vacuum button
on the side and then release it

17:58.620 --> 18:00.663
once the needles have made contact
with the skin.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.333
Should draw a significant sample
in less than one second.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.210
Chief Sousa and I
will monitor the operation

18:05.293 --> 18:06.628
from a surveillance van outside.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.255
We've disguised
two-way communication radios

18:09.506 --> 18:11.216
for both you and Mr Jarvis.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.426
A pair of glasses for him and

18:14.677 --> 18:17.055
this for you.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.184
Hmm.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.353
Do you have any questions
about your objective?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.106
I am a little confused
about this doohickey.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.358
Why don't you come over here,
show me how it works?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.859
You may leave us, Jason.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.199
Goodbye, Dr Jason Wilkes.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.871
Something wrong?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.082
No. No.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.126
I'm just excited to get to work.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.548
We can still call it off
if you're having second thoughts.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.633
There's no going back now.
Only forward.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.809
Testing, Mr Jarvis. Do you read me?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.061
Loud and clear, Miss Carter.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.021
Though it pains me to say it,

19:07.147 --> 19:09.524
Miss Underwood
is a phenomenal dancer.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.153
The decadence in this place
is truly repulsive.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.950
- We're reading you, too, Underwood.
- Have you seen Whitney Frost yet?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.203
I've just spotted her now.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.122
She's campaigning with her husband.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.920
Well, looky who's here.
It's the blond one.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.927
We should go say hi.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.023
It's not even
a question of security to me.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.358
Communism is a moral issue.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.819
The very ideals of our nation
are under threat.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.362
I feel the same way, Mr Chadwick.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.364
Now, when I'm elected,
my primary focus

19:58.448 --> 20:01.618
will be defending our borders
and beating back this red invasion.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.914
Which means more resources
and money for men like you.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.083
We'll take all the help we can get.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.669
Thompson here led the team
that was responsible

20:11.794 --> 20:15.298
for capturing a major Soviet threat
on US soil.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.633
Ah.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.509
That's the kind of people
this country needs.

20:18.593 --> 20:19.761
True born leaders.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.180
Such a shame you're so good
at your job, Chief Thompson.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.307
Ma'am?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.017
I'd love to take
that handsome face of yours

20:26.100 --> 20:28.978
and have you co-star with me
in my next picture.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.813
Uh...

20:31.481 --> 20:32.607
No.

20:32.774 --> 20:33.816
But, thank you.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.985
She's my secret weapon, Jack.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.447
When we get to DC, those old senators
won't know what hit them.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.658
<i>Thompson?
Our Jack Thompson?</i>

20:41.741 --> 20:42.784
<i>The hell is he doing here?</i>

20:42.867 --> 20:45.078
He appears to be rubbing elbows
with Miss Frost and Mr Chadwick.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.538
- Want me to kill him?
- Do not kill him!

20:47.664 --> 20:49.332
Come on. It'll be quick.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.167
Miss Carter,
I think we must abort this mission.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.253
Abort. Abort. Abort.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.338
Mr Jarvis, the clock is ticking
for Dr Wilkes.

20:55.421 --> 20:59.175
This is our only real, viable opportunity
to acquire the sample from Whitney.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.427
You must find a way
to complete your objective

21:01.511 --> 21:02.804
without being spotted by Thompson.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.013
Can you do that?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.724
Yes.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.518
Yes, I can.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.520
All right, Miss Underwood...

21:10.603 --> 21:12.522
Oh, dear.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.236
I told you Chadwick
would be a powerful friend.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.073
He certainly does seem to have
our best interests in mind.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.743
This room is filled with powerful friends.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.328
That's Thomas Gloucester.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.123
His financial firm has a hand
in every dollar

21:30.206 --> 21:32.208
that flows through Wall Street.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.294
There's Mortimer Hayes.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.797
He controls every major newspaper
west of the Mississippi.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.801
These are the men
that keep this world spinning.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.637
And they're starting to know your name.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.516
You've played your cards well so far.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.645
There's only one conspicuous stain
on your record.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.355
What's that?

21:54.689 --> 21:56.774
Jack, you know Hugh Jones.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.234
Oh, sure.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.154
He came to my New York office last year,

22:01.404 --> 22:02.822
ruffling feathers.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.409
You tell him about that girl?

22:07.785 --> 22:09.203
What girl?

22:09.871 --> 22:11.331
A few nights ago,

22:11.497 --> 22:13.750
one of Hugh's storage facilities
was raided.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.754
The atomic material used
in a prototype rocket was stolen.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.381
My intel says it was Peggy Carter.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.801
You coming after me again,
golden boy?

22:23.885 --> 22:26.054
No. I had no idea.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.181
Hugh, give us a moment, okay?

22:34.437 --> 22:38.733
This Carter woman
is disobeying your direct orders.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.819
Now, if you want to impress
the people in this room,

22:41.903 --> 22:44.238
climb the only ladder that counts,

22:45.156 --> 22:47.784
you can't let a female subordinate

22:47.867 --> 22:49.660
make an ass out of you like this.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.662
Yeah?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.921
I have pulled the fox
back out of the henhouse.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.299
Every second we remain here
puts us in more peril.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.802
Mr Jarvis, you have a valid reason
to be in attendance.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.805
You need to keep Thompson occupied
while Dottie retrieves the sample.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.139
You think
you can handle that, Underwood?

23:10.264 --> 23:13.393
I don't know.
It's such a complicated plan.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.436
Miss Underwood,

23:15.853 --> 23:18.147
you are a nuisance.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.566
But for the next 10 minutes,
you are going to follow instructions,

23:20.650 --> 23:23.027
and you will conduct yourself
like a professional.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.362
<i>Is that understood?</i>

23:24.654 --> 23:26.864
Yes, sir, Jeeves.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.492
Good.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.079
Now, I see Miss Frost
heading towards the powder room.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.211
Follow my lead.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.881
Whisky, up to here, please.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.095
You should smile more.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.141
Hasn't been much of a smiling night.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.810
Well, night's not over yet.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.482
- Chief Thompson. It is you.
- Jarvis?

24:01.566 --> 24:04.068
Do you know I've just won a $50 wager
with Mr O. Selznick.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.487
He thought you were Burt Lancaster.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.574
I didn't know
this was a butler-friendly affair.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.367
Oh, Mr Stark is a contributor.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.953
He likes to keep things diverse,
politically.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.664
Funny, I don't remember
you wearing glasses.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.250
Oh, I've developed
a slight astigmatism in one eye.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.877
I think they make me look rather refined.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.628
Where's Carter?

24:22.712 --> 24:24.255
Sitting by Mr Stark's swimming pool,

24:24.422 --> 24:26.966
reading a rather bawdy pulp novel
last time I saw her.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.885
I find that hard to believe.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.303
And why is that?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.721
Because she wouldn't miss
an opportunity

24:31.804 --> 24:33.681
to ruin this evening
for Calvin Chadwick.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.183
So, if you'll excuse me,

24:35.266 --> 24:37.810
I have a sudden urge
to go secure the perimeter.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.522
Uh, are you sure it's wise to...

24:42.231 --> 24:44.692
To cause such an uproar
at your employer's party?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.068
My employer?

24:46.444 --> 24:47.487
Yes. Mr Chadwick.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.572
He's always looking out
for ambitious men like yourself

24:49.655 --> 24:51.157
to do his bidding.
You're just his type.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.368
Oh. I'm Chief in the New York SSR.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.329
I serve the federal government.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.872
Oh, yes. My mistake.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.625
When he's elected senator,

25:00.708 --> 25:02.585
Chadwick and I will work together.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.379
To protect this country.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.382
Well, I find that hard to believe.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.718
Thanks for the input.
I'll be sure to forget it

25:10.801 --> 25:12.011
as soon as you're out of my sight.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.430
One final word of advice.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.767
I know you fancy yourself
a political animal,

25:17.892 --> 25:20.478
but you are decidedly out of your depth,
Chief Thompson,

25:21.395 --> 25:23.773
and these waters are full of sharks.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.067
Some advice for you.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.778
A little baking soda
will help get the stains out

25:28.861 --> 25:30.112
when you're doing Stark's laundry.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.700
Well, everybody knows that.

25:38.579 --> 25:42.333
Oh, my gosh.
I am such a klutz. Are you okay?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.876
I didn't stick you, did I?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.920
This thing will not stay on.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.630
I didn't feel a thing.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.059
That was Whitney Frost just now.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.811
Underwood, do you have the sample?

26:06.357 --> 26:07.858
What on Earth is that?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.414
- I understand that.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.487
Gentlemen, thank you
for agreeing to this meeting.

26:54.071 --> 26:57.700
Without further ado, my wife,
Whitney Frost.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.287
Distinguished Council members.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.206
It is such an honour
to be here today.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.542
Since the discovery of Zero Matter,

27:06.626 --> 27:10.087
I have been a vocal advocate
for its research and development

27:10.254 --> 27:11.714
in the energy market.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.841
But I was wrong.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.926
I was wrong about Zero Matter,

27:16.010 --> 27:18.804
and for that, I wanted to apologise.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.598
The mistake I made

27:20.681 --> 27:24.685
was in thinking that this discovery
was about energy.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.354
This is not about energy.

27:26.604 --> 27:29.440
This is about power.

27:30.274 --> 27:34.278
The kind of power
that could bring the world to its knees.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.781
But why tell you

27:39.283 --> 27:40.534
when I can show you?

27:52.088 --> 27:53.422
Observe.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.574
I must say, we all thought
you were going crazy,

28:20.700 --> 28:23.744
but thank you
for bringing this to our attention.

28:25.246 --> 28:29.417
I believe we're all in agreement
on how to proceed.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.046
Darling, you were perfect.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.383
Do not let her touch you!

28:37.675 --> 28:40.177
Cal! Cal, what's going on?

28:40.261 --> 28:41.846
- I'm sorry.
- Cal!

28:50.062 --> 28:51.355
No, no.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.948
Now, hold on.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.387
No. Whitney, please.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.222
Please.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.682
Darling, I'm sorry.

29:26.849 --> 29:27.933
I trusted you.

29:28.017 --> 29:29.310
I know. Please.

29:29.477 --> 29:30.853
No, no. Please.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.396
I made you.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.814
Please, don't...

29:59.173 --> 30:01.050
I'd like to call this meeting to order.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.264
Any objections?

30:07.348 --> 30:08.933
No.

30:09.558 --> 30:14.563
Mr Jones, I need unrestricted access
to all Roxxon facilities.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.524
Um...

30:16.816 --> 30:18.025
Yes, ma'am.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.611
I'm also gonna need you to speak
to Vernon Masters,

30:20.694 --> 30:23.906
bring him up to speed
on this administrative overhaul.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.617
Will that be a problem?

30:26.867 --> 30:27.910
No, ma'am.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.287
Mr Hayes,
I'm gonna need your publications

30:30.371 --> 30:34.166
to fabricate a story
on the sudden disappearance

30:34.250 --> 30:37.253
of my husband
and those other pasty buffoons.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.921
Yes, Miss Frost.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.172
Good.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.340
Good.

30:42.299 --> 30:47.012
I have chosen you
to be a part of my council

30:47.638 --> 30:52.101
because I believe that each of you
can contribute to my plans.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.352
And I promise you,

30:53.435 --> 30:57.731
as long as you remain loyal
and of use to me,

30:58.941 --> 31:02.486
I will bring you unlimited power

31:02.570 --> 31:05.406
unlike anything
this world has ever seen.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.533
I have something to say.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.326
Yes, Mr Jones?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.915
I'm very excited
about this collaboration,

31:15.249 --> 31:18.961
and I look forward to seeing
where your leadership takes us,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.087
Miss Frost.

31:21.463 --> 31:22.965
Thank you, Mr Jones.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.181
Meeting adjourned.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.392
I have broken away
from Chief Thompson,

31:33.559 --> 31:35.352
but he is overtly suspicious
of my presence

31:35.436 --> 31:37.104
and on high alert for you, Miss Carter.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.272
<i>I heard the entire
conversation.</i>

31:38.355 --> 31:39.690
Well played, Mr Jarvis.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.650
Underwood dumped her radio.
Do you have eyes on her?

31:41.942 --> 31:45.112
I am presently engaged
in a frenzied search for her

31:45.195 --> 31:46.989
while speaking to my glasses
like a madman.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.741
Keep looking. Help is on the way.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.826
- We have to go in.
- Peggy, you're injured.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.036
If you get spotted, you can't run.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.287
If you get cornered, you can't fight.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.788
So, I'll improvise.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.709
Oh...

31:58.792 --> 32:00.294
You okay?

32:00.628 --> 32:01.670
Fine.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.380
You sure?

32:03.756 --> 32:04.798
Mmm-hmm. Oh...

32:05.257 --> 32:06.675
'Cause it looks like
you just popped your stitches

32:06.759 --> 32:08.010
trying to open a door.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.057
Not fun when your body quits on you,
is it?

32:13.515 --> 32:14.642
Welcome to my world.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.393
Oh, how do you cope with it?

32:17.353 --> 32:19.021
I'll tell you when I learn how.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.481
But it helps to know that sometimes

32:20.564 --> 32:22.608
you have to put your faith in others
to get the job done.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.236
Great party.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.698
Bring her to me, alive!

33:12.032 --> 33:13.117
How is it?

33:13.200 --> 33:16.161
Somewhere between
infuriating and embarrassing.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.747
Looks like I'll have to schedule
a follow-up appointment with Violet.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.374
Yeah, well...

33:21.166 --> 33:22.251
We'll see.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.336
- Is there a problem?
- No,

33:24.420 --> 33:25.546
we'll get you fixed up.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.798
I meant with Violet.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.009
Uh, no.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.176
Not at all.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.344
Daniel.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.767
Violet, um,

33:39.393 --> 33:40.769
broke off the engagement.

33:40.853 --> 33:41.937
What?

33:42.396 --> 33:43.439
Why?

33:43.731 --> 33:44.815
It's complicated.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.984
Who does she think she is,
that she can do better than you?

33:47.151 --> 33:49.028
That's not it. I messed up.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.612
- Then I'll speak to her.
- No!

33:50.696 --> 33:53.991
Nonsense. I will go on your behalf and
enlighten her to the massive blunder

33:54.074 --> 33:55.617
- that she's about to make.
- That is not a good idea.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.952
Of course it is. I'm very persuasive.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.245
Peggy, she broke it off with me

33:58.328 --> 33:59.705
because she thinks
I'm in love with you.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.420
Oh, my God.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.048
Daniel...

34:09.131 --> 34:11.425
- It's fine. It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

34:12.593 --> 34:14.178
You were happy out here,
and then I came

34:14.261 --> 34:16.055
and mucked up your whole life.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.974
Maybe I was just fooling myself.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.934
I'm so sorry.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.145
Truly.

34:49.505 --> 34:52.341
Miss Carter? Hello? Hello?

34:56.595 --> 34:58.097
Oh, no.

35:20.369 --> 35:21.995
Miss Underwood.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.250
Nice to see you again.

35:36.635 --> 35:41.098
No ID, and a gun,
the guy's private security. This is bad.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.100
Dottie is either in or causing trouble.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.685
Regardless, we...

35:45.269 --> 35:48.021
I have tried repeatedly
to make contact with... Oh!

35:48.105 --> 35:49.231
Who's the dead gentleman?

35:49.314 --> 35:50.357
The one who caved in
the roof of the van

35:50.440 --> 35:51.567
and knocked out communications.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.068
- Where's Dottie?
- I have no idea.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.612
I searched everywhere,
though I did manage to recover this.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.323
She disappeared but left
the sample of Zero Matter behind?

35:58.407 --> 35:59.616
It would appear so.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.910
But we can use the tracking device
implanted in her necklace.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.954
The receiver was crushed
with the rest of our gear.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.664
We need to get back to Stark's
and make repairs.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.332
No, I'm not leaving Dottie Underwood
in the wild.

36:07.416 --> 36:08.667
Mr Jarvis, take me in with you.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.878
I would love to, Miss Carter,
but I've just been escorted out

36:10.961 --> 36:12.504
rather forcefully by hotel security.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.465
Apparently, they didn't appreciate
my snooping around the upper floors.

36:15.549 --> 36:17.509
Peggy, the party's over. Look.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.512
It's too risky.
We stay here, we blow our cover.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.390
I don't like it, either,
but retreat is our only option right now.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.810
Let's go.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.355
This is all a bit much, Hugh.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.525
Forgive me
if I take a moment to process it.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.487
Trust me, you're getting this news
the easy way.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.698
- Whitney Frost?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.575
And there's no room for pushback?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.702
She's calling the shots now.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.621
You get that package to her tonight.

36:54.463 --> 36:55.881
Nice work, son.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.216
Thank you, Vernon.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.383
Yeah.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.678
Really a great job of cleaning up
the mess you made.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.722
What's that supposed to mean?

37:03.805 --> 37:05.182
This is your girl, Carter.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.310
This whole fiasco's
got her fingerprints all over it.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.520
I think you got this mixed up.
That was Underwood that we just...

37:10.604 --> 37:14.566
Underwood was sprung
with the help of a female psychiatrist.

37:14.650 --> 37:18.070
Who else besides Carter
would be so reckless

37:18.153 --> 37:21.490
as to let that nut case
loose on this party?

37:22.407 --> 37:25.869
You said yourself that you saw
Stark's butler here, acting fishy.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.706
We all know that those two
are thick as thieves.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.500
It doesn't make sense.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.128
If it is Carter, what's the angle?
What is she trying to accomplish?

37:37.339 --> 37:38.548
It doesn't matter.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.634
You're gonna have to take her out.

37:42.219 --> 37:44.096
I'm not gonna kill Peggy Carter.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.098
Who said kill?

37:47.683 --> 37:51.353
That would be wrong,
both morally and strategically.

37:51.853 --> 37:55.399
Killing makes her a martyr,
shines more of a light on her.

37:55.482 --> 38:00.153
I need you to destroy
the very idea of her,

38:00.279 --> 38:04.408
discredit, disgrace,
and subdue Agent Carter

38:04.491 --> 38:07.536
so that all this misguided work
that she's done

38:07.911 --> 38:10.747
becomes unquestionably invalid.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.960
That presents
a whole new set of problems.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.964
Oh, God.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.633
I must be slipping in my old age.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.137
She's got something on you,
doesn't she?

38:25.887 --> 38:26.972
Don't say it.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.515
You don't need to tell me what it is.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.769
It must be pretty bad, though.
Shameful, even.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.023
I'll tell you this, Jack,

38:36.106 --> 38:41.194
the only way to fight leverage
is with leverage.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.448
Dig something up on her?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.867
Everybody's got secrets.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.286
Carter's a girl scout.

38:50.037 --> 38:52.831
If you can't find a way to take her down

38:54.374 --> 38:57.419
then I have to question whether
you're suited for high command

38:57.502 --> 38:59.004
in this government.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.425
There is no question, sir.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.941
I can't tell you
how relieved I am to see this.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.111
This could save my life.
I... I can't thank you enough.

39:26.907 --> 39:29.743
Ana helped me sketch some blueprints
for a containment chamber.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.870
It should be
a relatively easy construction.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.872
These are the blueprints here.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.208
You'll want to take a look
and see what materials we'll need.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.085
I'd like to start building
as soon as possible.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.212
I'm sorry, Dr Wilkes.
We'll have to look at them later.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.423
- Later?
- Dottie Underwood gave us the slip.

39:43.507 --> 39:44.883
As long as she's unaccounted for,

39:44.966 --> 39:47.135
there's no way to calculate
how many lives are in danger.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.595
- But I'm in the middle of...
- Miss Carter,

39:49.429 --> 39:51.765
a visitor. It's Chief Thompson.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.267
Is that good or bad?

39:55.936 --> 39:57.270
- Don't go.
- I'll be fine.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.480
It's not worth the risk.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.606
Jarvis can send him packing.

39:59.689 --> 40:00.941
I'll be the next stop on his blame train.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.901
- I'll take the heat for you.
- That's kind, Daniel,

40:02.984 --> 40:04.736
but I can handle Jack Thompson.

40:15.497 --> 40:17.499
Oh, this is unexpected.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.128
Sorry for the hour.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.462
Hope I didn't wake you.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.589
- No, I'm an early riser.
- That's funny.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.092
Sure look like you're coming off
a long night.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.761
Oh.
Your charm knows no bounds.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.304
It's a wonder you're not married yet.

40:32.305 --> 40:36.935
You ever heard
of a Dr Katherine Wexford?

40:37.269 --> 40:39.104
I haven't. Who is she?

40:39.229 --> 40:40.397
You know her.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.482
I think she's someone very close to you.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.193
I knew a Katherine Hornstock once,

40:45.277 --> 40:46.653
but we weren't that close.

40:54.161 --> 40:55.620
I know what you're doing, Carter.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.540
Is there something I can do for you,
Chief Thompson?

40:58.623 --> 41:00.959
I'm on a flight back to New York at 4:30.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.878
You're coming with me.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.004
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.130
I wasn't asking.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.299
And there's no place in my office

41:07.382 --> 41:09.426
for agents who can't follow
simple orders.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.389
Well, it's not the best job market
out there for women right now,

41:14.890 --> 41:16.183
but I'll just have to manage.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.060
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

41:19.352 --> 41:22.397
You're chasing boogeymen down
into a pit of quicksand.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.609
Please, just get on this flight with me.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.694
Leave all this behind.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.071
It's okay to be wrong from time to time.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.325
Believe it or not,
I've been wrong before.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.035
I know what it feels like.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.662
I'm not wrong, not this time.

41:38.038 --> 41:39.539
How much you willing to bet on it?

41:39.623 --> 41:40.832
Hmm...

41:41.541 --> 41:42.918
Everything I've got.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.336
That's a lot to lose.

41:44.461 --> 41:45.795
But I won't lose.

41:47.047 --> 41:48.381
Yes, you will.

41:50.091 --> 41:52.010
And when you do,

41:52.969 --> 41:54.554
you'll never see it coming.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.350
Good luck, Peggy.
