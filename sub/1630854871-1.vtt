on taking you in.

you're capable of doing

I put you on speaker?

right by you, Dallas.

1:16:38.065 --> 1:16:39.295

Well, now you and I both know
that's not exactly true.

1:16:59.856 --> 1:17:02.890
Maybe it was a good thing
that you and Iris reconnected.

1:17:02.925 --> 1:17:03.957
Who knows?

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:06.861
No, no.

Not after what
happened to Trish.

1:17:09.096 --> 1:17:10.227
I can't.

1:17:12.231 --> 1:17:15.771
We know what
happened with Trish,

as Detective Roberts.

in the murder.

No, I don't.

1:18:16.262 --> 1:18:19.131

1:19:10.118 --> 1:19:11.183
You know what this is?

I have to breathe in that
so many minutes a day,

1:19:14.892 --> 1:19:18.091
or they say I'll be dead,
but I'll never be dead.

1:19:21.426 --> 1:19:23.360
What happened with the appeal?

1:19:25.463 --> 1:19:26.935

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:30.906
Well, he did everything
that Blue asked him to do.

1:19:30.941 --> 1:19:32.039
As always.

1:19:35.407 --> 1:19:37.341
You know what Ultio means?

1:19:38.509 --> 1:19:40.014
Revenge.

1:19:43.052 --> 1:19:45.085
And you know what
the blind man did?

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:46.889
He made a weapon.

1:19:47.518 --> 1:19:49.155
He made a weapon.

1:19:49.190 --> 1:19:52.389
And the problem is,
he can't control him.

1:19:54.162 --> 1:19:58.395
So you and I, we are gonna
have to take control.

1:19:58.430 --> 1:20:00.298
I'm already moving on that.

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:04.533
And we have full support
of the government.

1:20:05.404 --> 1:20:06.843

1:20:08.374 --> 1:20:09.978
- Really?
- Yeah.

You don't have
anything else
to say to me?

1:20:17.218 --> 1:20:18.415
Yeah, I do.

1:20:19.050 --> 1:20:20.890
We had a little complication.

1:20:22.091 --> 1:20:23.926
- How was that?
- With Lars?

1:20:23.961 --> 1:20:25.488
He escaped, he got away.

1:20:29.934 --> 1:20:30.966
Ivan!

1:20:32.431 --> 1:20:35.498
The man needs ice.
More ice.

1:20:37.106 --> 1:20:38.908
I know you have
an ice pick, Ivan.

1:20:38.943 --> 1:20:40.976
Why don't you stab it
three times

1:20:41.011 --> 1:20:44.276
and bring him three pieces
of fucking ice for his drink?

1:20:52.990 --> 1:20:55.485
And we even did
everything we could. We...

1:20:55.954 --> 1:20:58.961
We actually used Iris as bait.

1:20:59.997 --> 1:21:01.623
I didn't sanction that.

1:21:02.092 --> 1:21:04.659
I thought it'd be
a good idea, and it worked.

1:21:06.366 --> 1:21:08.333
Well, don't ever tell him,

1:21:08.368 --> 1:21:11.468
because we sure as hell
don't want that weapon

1:21:11.503 --> 1:21:14.339
turned around at us.

1:21:15.243 --> 1:21:16.341
Or we're done.

1:21:19.445 --> 1:21:21.511
[dramatic music playing]

1:21:32.326 --> 1:21:35.030
[intense music playing]
