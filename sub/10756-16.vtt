00:09.567 --> 00:12.798
My 8-year-old son is visiting me
this week, and he asked specifically

00:12.967 --> 00:15.561
if I could arrange a tour
of the Microsoft complex.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.962
I was wondering
what your policy is on...

00:18.127 --> 00:20.004
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:20.407 --> 00:22.637
You know, I don't often trade
on my celebrity status,

00:22.807 --> 00:26.117
but does the name Frasier Crane
mean anything to you?

00:26.767 --> 00:28.678
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:29.207 --> 00:31.482
Well, you know, it's entirely possible

00:31.647 --> 00:35.276
that one day a relative of yours
may wish to tour my workplace...

00:35.447 --> 00:39.122
It's a radio station. Oh, forget it!

00:39.327 --> 00:41.204
- Even been close,
that would be one thing.

00:41.367 --> 00:44.677
- But I beat that tag by a mile. A mile.
- Calm down, slugger. It's all right.

00:44.847 --> 00:46.724
- A mile!
- I take it you lost the game.

00:46.887 --> 00:49.799
No, we won the game, but Roz got
kicked out for arguing with the ump.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.401
She kicked dirt on his shoes,
chest-butted him,

00:52.607 --> 00:55.201
almost took a bite out of his finger
when he stuck it in her face.

00:55.407 --> 00:57.875
You can't coach that kind of thing.

00:58.647 --> 01:03.004
All right, there's a guy on second,
one guy's out, I drive one to the gap.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.236
The throw to the cut-off man
is late, our guy's safe,

01:05.407 --> 01:08.877
I try to stretch it to a double. I make a
beautiful hook slide right under the tag.

01:09.047 --> 01:10.036
How can I be out?

01:10.247 --> 01:13.637
I'm still trying to understand why
you drove to the Gap during the game.

01:16.087 --> 01:18.442
Look, I'm gonna go work
on the line-up for Saturday's game.

01:18.607 --> 01:21.519
- You know, I love being in charge.
- Oh, can I play second base?

01:21.687 --> 01:23.040
No. Liz Budner's playing second.

01:23.207 --> 01:26.085
Liz Budner? Why?
What can she do that I can't?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.676
It's what she will do that you won't.

01:30.207 --> 01:35.201
Oh, Roz. Listen, didn't you used
to date some executive at Microsoft?

01:36.287 --> 01:38.084
Scott Blankman.

01:38.247 --> 01:39.885
Talk about your messy break-ups.

01:40.047 --> 01:42.561
Even after I dumped the guy,
he kept calling me.

01:42.767 --> 01:43.882
At first, he'd make excuses:

01:44.047 --> 01:45.958
"Sorry, I hit the wrong button
on my speed dial."

01:46.127 --> 01:48.197
Then he gave up the pretence
and there'd be sobbing

01:48.367 --> 01:50.119
- on the other end of the line.
- Oh, God.

01:50.287 --> 01:54.121
I finally said, "Scott, I never, ever
want to talk to you again."

01:54.287 --> 01:56.562
- Why do you ask?
- I'd like you give him a call.

01:57.127 --> 01:59.163
- What?
- Frederick's coming to visit this week.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.443
The only thing he asked for
was a tour of Microsoft.

02:01.607 --> 02:04.724
I sort of already, well,
promised that I could arrange it.

02:04.887 --> 02:06.798
Frasier, you're asking me
to call a man

02:06.967 --> 02:08.877
who camped outside
my apartment building

02:09.047 --> 02:10.366
and held a big sign up that said:

02:10.526 --> 02:13.439
- "Roz Doyle is afraid to love."
- Okay, I understand.

02:13.607 --> 02:15.723
I just thought you'd be
more sympathetic, that's all.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.161
I can't.

02:17.327 --> 02:20.478
I do recall a story
you told me not long ago

02:20.647 --> 02:24.083
about a young girl living in Wisconsin,
who wanted desperately for her mother

02:24.247 --> 02:27.444
to drive her to Chicago to see
Bobby Sherman open a shopping mall.

02:28.127 --> 02:30.436
But her mother was just too busy.

02:30.607 --> 02:31.881
What did that girl do that night?

02:32.047 --> 02:35.278
She cried herself to sleep
on her little Bobby Sherman pillow.

02:37.247 --> 02:39.238
I hate you.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.359
[DOORBELL CHIMES]

02:45.327 --> 02:47.522
FRASIER: Niles.
- Good morning. Is Frederick up yet?

02:47.687 --> 02:50.155
He went out with his grandfather
for an early morning walk.

02:50.327 --> 02:52.158
I went through
my old albums this morning

02:52.327 --> 02:54.318
and found photos of us
when we were Frederick's age.

02:54.487 --> 02:56.557
- Oh, Lord.
- Thought he might find them amusing.

02:56.727 --> 03:01.005
Oh, here. There we are, all dressed up,
ready for our first Cub Scout hike.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.202
And last.

03:02.367 --> 03:05.837
Yes, well, we didn't exactly
endear ourselves to the pack.

03:06.007 --> 03:07.281
All the other kids had knapsacks,

03:07.447 --> 03:10.280
we showed up with those
monogrammed train cases.

03:11.367 --> 03:14.086
Niles, refresh my memory.
Why are we wearing plastic snouts

03:14.247 --> 03:16.203
and a tiny little wading pool
around our waists?

03:16.407 --> 03:18.716
You've forgotten. That Halloween
we went as the Bay of Pigs.

03:18.887 --> 03:20.206
FRASIER:
Ah.

03:21.447 --> 03:23.005
As I recall, nobody got it.

03:23.447 --> 03:27.156
<i>I finally had to take to telling
that we were Swine Lake.</i>

03:27.327 --> 03:28.919
They didn't get that either.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.522
- That was a long evening.
- Yeah.

03:32.807 --> 03:35.162
So, what do you have in store
for Frederick this visit?

03:35.327 --> 03:37.318
We're gonna go whale-watching,
the planetarium,

03:37.487 --> 03:39.762
and Roz is helping me
arrange a tour of Microsoft.

03:39.927 --> 03:41.838
It's the one thing Freddie
specifically requested.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.560
Someone's running for
Dad of the Year.

03:43.767 --> 03:45.359
Yes, well, you know how it is.

03:45.527 --> 03:47.199
I don't get to see him
as often as I'd like.

03:47.367 --> 03:50.484
Memories of this trip
will have to last until the next one.

03:50.687 --> 03:52.962
Can you blame me
for wanting it to be perfect?

03:53.167 --> 03:55.078
- Hi, Dad.
FRASIER: Oh, hello, Freddie.

03:55.247 --> 03:57.715
Dad, did Grandpa ever tell you
the story how he captured

03:57.887 --> 04:00.037
four bank robbers
with just a nightstick?

04:00.247 --> 04:02.363
No. He did tell me how
he captured two bank robbers

04:02.527 --> 04:05.246
with just a revolver,
his partner and a SWAT team.

04:05.447 --> 04:07.244
- They got there later.
FRASIER: Well...

04:07.407 --> 04:09.637
- Hello, Uncle Niles.
NILES: Hello, Frederick.

04:09.807 --> 04:12.082
My, aren't you getting big.

04:12.287 --> 04:15.245
I'm the same exact size I was
the last time you saw me.

04:15.447 --> 04:19.486
Well, your mother's cooking
will do that for a growing boy.

04:20.447 --> 04:22.642
- Are we going to Microsoft today?
- Well, Freddie,

04:22.807 --> 04:25.605
I thought we'd go by the radio station.
I could show you where I work.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.325
- That'll be fun, won't it?
- Yes.

04:27.487 --> 04:30.718
- When are we going to Microsoft?
- Well, Saturday.

04:30.887 --> 04:32.161
FREDERICK:
Excellent.

04:32.367 --> 04:35.040
- Hey, good morning, Dr Crane.
- Good morning, Daphne.

04:35.247 --> 04:38.922
- Hi, Daphne.
- Hello, Frederick.

04:39.087 --> 04:41.282
Tell your dad what you saw
in the park with Eddie.

04:41.487 --> 04:44.160
Hi, Daphne.

04:45.207 --> 04:47.721
- Frederick's my boyfriend.
- Oh, really.

04:47.927 --> 04:50.919
I got a present for you. Wait here.

04:51.367 --> 04:53.437
That's so cute.
He's got a crush on you.

04:53.607 --> 04:57.759
Yes, he spent the entire evening
sitting on Daphne's lap, watching TV.

04:58.647 --> 05:00.444
Really.

05:02.327 --> 05:04.966
And this morning I heard
this soft little knocking at my door,

05:05.127 --> 05:09.359
and it was Frederick, asking if
he could climb into bed with me.

05:09.527 --> 05:11.324
Really.

05:12.967 --> 05:16.562
- It's for you.
DAPHNE: Oh, well, isn't this lovely.

05:16.727 --> 05:19.560
Look, here's Frederick.
And here I am.

05:19.727 --> 05:22.480
- And what are we doing?
- Getting married.

05:23.327 --> 05:25.318
Really.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.716
DAPHNE: Come on, Frederick,
let's go hang this on the fridge.

05:28.887 --> 05:30.240
FREDERICK:
Okay.

05:30.967 --> 05:32.639
Do you think it's healthy
for a little boy

05:32.847 --> 05:35.566
to be so obsessed with a woman
he can't possibly have?

05:35.767 --> 05:38.839
Niles, have you actually sunk
so low as to be jealous of him?

05:39.287 --> 05:41.403
No, I'm not jealous. I'm just a bit...

05:41.567 --> 05:44.001
Well, maybe envious.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.876
That's ridiculous. What have
you got to be envious of?

05:47.087 --> 05:50.318
DAPHNE: Hold on!
FREDERICK: Wee!

05:52.967 --> 05:55.162
Wee!

06:01.727 --> 06:04.366
And this is the booth
where it all happens.

06:04.527 --> 06:07.087
- Very impressive.
- Well...

06:07.247 --> 06:10.478
This is the talkback button here,
if I want to talk to Roz,

06:10.647 --> 06:12.478
the cough button
if I want to mute the mike.

06:12.647 --> 06:14.797
This button here is very special.
It sends a death ray

06:14.967 --> 06:17.606
shooting from the phone
of any caller who annoys me.

06:18.167 --> 06:19.680
You wish.

06:20.207 --> 06:21.799
Yes, I do.

06:21.967 --> 06:24.527
Well, okay, Roz, what have
we done to ourselves today?

06:24.687 --> 06:27.076
Well, we went out last night
to celebrate our big win.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.800
- Ah.
ROZ: Had a few margaritas.

06:28.967 --> 06:31.606
Someone started a conga line.
I wasn't gonna get in it.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.122
I think Gary, our shortstop,
got on the end of the line.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.524
That man has a butt that makes you
wanna reach out with both hands

06:37.727 --> 06:40.844
and give Freddie
a great big Seattle hug.

06:41.287 --> 06:42.720
- Good save, Roz.
ROZ: Thank you.

06:42.887 --> 06:44.878
- I don't believe you've met Bulldog.
- Hey, kid.

06:45.087 --> 06:48.762
- Why are you called Bulldog?
- People just always call me that.

06:48.927 --> 06:50.758
But why?

06:51.727 --> 06:53.319
- I don't know.
- Well, all right, Bulldog.

06:53.487 --> 06:56.001
- Roz and I have a show to prepare for.
- No, no. Wait a minute.

06:56.167 --> 06:59.045
This is important.
Why do people call me Bulldog?

06:59.207 --> 07:00.196
There has to be a reason.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.641
[BULLDOG BARKS]

07:02.727 --> 07:05.036
This is gonna drive me nuts.

07:05.487 --> 07:07.239
Who's subbing for me
in Saturday's game?

07:07.407 --> 07:09.363
We gotta have a ninth body
out there or we forfeit.

07:09.567 --> 07:13.116
- Oh, right. How about Mindy Guthrie?
- Eight months pregnant.

November, December...

07:21.247 --> 07:24.080
Anyway, you better find somebody.
And speaking of bad news, Frasier,

07:24.247 --> 07:25.839
I finally got a call
from Scott Blankman...

07:26.007 --> 07:27.918
Roz... Frederick,
talk with Bulldog for a minute.

07:28.087 --> 07:30.317
- I have to discuss something with Roz.
FREDERICK: Okay.

07:30.527 --> 07:33.041
Oh, yeah, no problem.

07:35.327 --> 07:37.682
Oh, hey. In a little while
I'm gonna bring in my cart.

07:37.847 --> 07:40.520
- You can hit the gong.
- Why?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.925
It's loud. I make a lot
of loud noises in my show.

07:44.127 --> 07:46.322
- Why?
- I don't know.

07:46.487 --> 07:48.637
Boy, I'm starting to get a headache.

07:48.847 --> 07:51.441
If you need a softball player,
why don't you use my dad.

07:51.647 --> 07:53.399
Oh, yeah, right.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.400
Isn't he good?

07:56.287 --> 07:59.882
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's great.
He is the best, you know.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.880
I wish he could play, but I think
your dad's busy Saturday.

08:03.087 --> 08:06.204
- He's taking me to Microsoft.
- Yeah, right.

08:06.367 --> 08:10.076
Man, I wish he could play, because
if he were playing, we'd win for sure.

08:10.287 --> 08:12.164
I'm sorry, Frasier. That's all I can do.

08:12.327 --> 08:14.636
Scott quit Microsoft
right after we broke up.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.562
Well, I don't look forward
to telling Frederick.

08:17.727 --> 08:19.319
He'll be so disappointed.

08:19.527 --> 08:22.917
Well, you know, if he wants a tour
of a seminary, I've got an in there now.

08:26.287 --> 08:27.561
I don't know. I give up.

to Microsoft anymore.

- You don't?
- Oh, hey. Yes, he does. Wait a minute.

08:41.327 --> 08:43.557

spend a day at Microsoft?

08:43.727 --> 08:48.323

you know, this is your vacation.

You are the boss.
Whatever you say goes.

Great. I wanna see you play
in the softball game.

08:53.287 --> 08:55.881
- What?
- You could take Roz's place.

08:56.047 --> 08:58.163
Well, you know, as much
as I'd love to play softball,

08:58.327 --> 09:00.124
I really don't think
that Bulldog wants me to.

09:00.327 --> 09:03.125
Yes, he does. He said
you were the best. Right?

09:03.287 --> 09:05.596
That's what I said.

09:05.807 --> 09:09.197
- Well, thank you, Bulldog.
- So you'll play?

09:09.407 --> 09:12.922
- Well, I don't see how I can refuse.
- Great. I can't wait to tell Daphne.

09:13.087 --> 09:15.601
Yes, well, speaking of Daphne,
while you're waiting for Daphne,

09:15.767 --> 09:18.645
why don't you go on out, get yourself
a candy bar out of the machine.

09:18.807 --> 09:20.525
Mother says candy rots
tooth enamel.

09:20.687 --> 09:23.201
Yes, well, chew on the side
of your mouth. Rot your baby teeth.

09:24.567 --> 09:27.286
What do you think you're doing,
telling him I'm a good softball player?

09:27.487 --> 09:29.921
Trying to be nice. You want me
to tell him you're a big lame-o?

09:30.087 --> 09:32.681
- No, I don't.
- Hey, look, I know how tough it is

09:32.847 --> 09:36.396
when you're a kid and you find out
your dad's not as great as you thought.

09:36.567 --> 09:39.923
Look, I was about
Frederick's age when...

09:40.847 --> 09:43.202
Well, I came home.
My mom was out

09:43.367 --> 09:45.198
and I caught my dad
with another woman.

09:45.967 --> 09:48.845
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm sorry.
- No, no. No, wait.

09:49.007 --> 09:51.282
You haven't heard the bad part yet.

09:52.007 --> 09:54.157
She was ugly, doc.

09:54.567 --> 09:58.196
I mean, coyote ugly. My own dad.

09:58.407 --> 10:00.443
And the best excuse
he could come up with was:

10:00.607 --> 10:04.282
"Hey, you don't look at the mantel
when you're poking the fire."

10:06.727 --> 10:10.083
Hey! I just got that.

10:14.567 --> 10:18.037
I just keep thinking back to that time
when Dad made us try Little League.

10:18.207 --> 10:19.481
I'll never forget the humiliation

10:19.647 --> 10:22.320
of getting up to bat
for the first time in my life,

10:22.487 --> 10:24.682
hearing the other team all cry out:

10:24.847 --> 10:28.157
"Move in, everybody. Crane's up."

10:28.847 --> 10:31.281
But they moved back out again
after you took your first swing.

10:31.487 --> 10:33.955
Only because the bat
flew out of my hands.

10:35.567 --> 10:36.841
You worry too much.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.441
Your co-workers aren't
expecting you to play brilliantly.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.916
No, I can live with playing badly
in front of my co-workers.

10:42.127 --> 10:44.118
It's Frederick I'm worried about.

10:44.287 --> 10:46.881
He's still at that age where
he thinks his father can do anything.

10:47.087 --> 10:49.123
Every child, at some point,
must discover

10:49.287 --> 10:51.323
- that his father is not a superhero.
- I know.

10:51.487 --> 10:53.523
It's a healthy part
of the developmental process.

10:53.687 --> 10:56.281
I know someday he's gonna
have to learn that I'm not perfect.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.915
It's just... I was hoping it might be
something less humiliating,

10:59.087 --> 11:02.238
like seeing me fast-dance
at a family wedding.

11:03.487 --> 11:06.047
- You consider that less humiliating?
- Well...

11:06.207 --> 11:08.163
Hello. Look who's here.

11:08.327 --> 11:10.124
You two have fun
while I was at work?

11:10.287 --> 11:12.039
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

11:12.207 --> 11:14.767
We went to the amusement park.
We had a lovely time.

11:14.927 --> 11:17.077
Only, I think the Ferris wheel
scared him a bit.

11:17.247 --> 11:20.319
He spent the whole ride
hugging me for dear life.

11:20.527 --> 11:22.324
Really.

11:22.767 --> 11:26.123
Her hair smells like strawberry.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.444
It smells like peach blossoms,
lavender and vanilla.

11:31.287 --> 11:33.323
From over here, at least.

11:34.247 --> 11:37.284
Uncle Niles, are you coming to watch
my dad play in the softball game?

11:37.447 --> 11:40.245
- He's the best one on the team.
- Well, of course I am, Freddie.

11:40.407 --> 11:43.285
I'll be there sitting
right between you and Daphne.

11:44.047 --> 11:46.322
Well, come on, Frederick.
Let's go get some hot chocolate.

11:46.527 --> 11:47.676
FREDERICK:
Okay.

11:47.847 --> 11:50.759
- So you see the problem.
- I certainly do.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.804
No, that's your problem.

11:53.447 --> 11:56.200
My problem is that I promised
Frederick I would play on Saturday.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.800
Guess I'm left with only one choice.

11:58.007 --> 11:59.884
- You're gonna fake an injury?
- No, course not.

12:00.047 --> 12:02.322
- I've got to learn how to play softball.
- In two days?

12:02.487 --> 12:04.443
Well, back in college,
when Stu Oberfeld got sick,

12:04.607 --> 12:07.246
I learned the role of Mercutio
in a day and a half. I was brilliant.

12:07.447 --> 12:10.280
In the duelling scene, the audience
was on the edge of their seats.

12:10.487 --> 12:13.718
Yes, and they were under them when
the sword flew out of your hands.

12:19.687 --> 12:22.804
FRASIER: Gee, Dad, I wanna thank
you for helping me out with this.

12:22.967 --> 12:26.277
MARTIN: Don't mention it.
We're gonna whip you right into shape.

12:26.447 --> 12:27.721
It must have been disappointing

12:27.887 --> 12:30.242
I never took any interest
in this sort of thing as a kid.

12:30.407 --> 12:31.760
MARTIN:
Well, I understood.

12:31.927 --> 12:34.202
Guess it's a little complex
I must have developed

12:34.367 --> 12:37.916
when I was growing up. The doorbell
would ring, I'd run to answer it,

12:38.127 --> 12:41.836
and then there'd be the neighbourhood
kids with their baseball gloves

12:42.047 --> 12:45.244
and their bats, looking for
somebody else to join their game.

12:45.407 --> 12:48.524
They'd say, "Hey, can your dad
come out and play?"

12:48.727 --> 12:52.322
Well, never mind that. You know,
it's kind of fun to finally be out here.

12:52.567 --> 12:57.880
<i>At the risk of sounding like Stanley
cornering Blanche DuBois in Streetcar,</i>

12:58.047 --> 13:00.402
we've had this date with each other
from the very beginning.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.080
I knew you'd ruin it.

13:02.247 --> 13:04.556
All right, come on.
Put your helmet on.

13:05.207 --> 13:07.482
FRASIER: Gee, it's kind of tight.
- Well, it's supposed to.

13:07.647 --> 13:09.365
It stops you from getting hurt.

13:09.527 --> 13:12.644
MARTIN:
Okay? Here, all right. There you go.

13:12.807 --> 13:14.525
Now...

13:15.287 --> 13:17.721
...take your bat, get into the stance,
just like I told you.

13:17.887 --> 13:19.923
I'm gonna turn the machine on.

13:20.087 --> 13:23.159
The good thing about these balls
is that they're all at the same level,

13:23.367 --> 13:26.165
so you can work on your form
and your timing. All right?

13:26.327 --> 13:28.522
Okay, now, here we go.

13:29.087 --> 13:30.759
Ah!

13:30.967 --> 13:34.084
What is that? A pitching machine
or a particle accelerator?

13:34.887 --> 13:37.959
All right, all right.
I'll crank it down to a lower setting.

13:38.127 --> 13:39.799
Okay, now, just remember,

13:40.007 --> 13:43.716
left elbow in, right elbow up,
knees bent.

13:43.927 --> 13:45.758
All the weight on the balls
of your feet, okay?

13:45.927 --> 13:48.885
Now, just step into the pitch.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.159
Oh, yeah, and swing the bat.

13:53.367 --> 13:55.119
Dad, can't you just
slow it down a little bit?

13:55.287 --> 13:57.926
All right, but if any of the other
fathers come back here,

13:58.087 --> 13:59.839
I'm taking it off the peewee setting.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.481
Okay. All right. Now, from the hips.

14:02.687 --> 14:04.564
Nice and easy. Don't try to kill it.

14:04.727 --> 14:07.560
Just try to make contact.
Okay, you ready?

14:08.327 --> 14:09.999
Ready.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.317
What are you looking at?
Dad, they're looking at me.

14:16.527 --> 14:17.926
Get out of here. Go on.

14:18.127 --> 14:19.765
Buzz off!

FRASIER: Did you hear that?
Hear that? I touched it that time. I did.

14:31.727 --> 14:34.082
No, it didn't.
That was my knee cracking.

14:34.247 --> 14:35.600
You're doing a lot better, though.

14:35.807 --> 14:39.277
Six in a row without hitting yourself
in the kidney on your follow-through.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.159
FRASIER:
Who am I kidding? This is hopeless.

14:41.327 --> 14:44.080
Oh, well. Well, why don't we
just try changing bats.

14:44.287 --> 14:45.925
I couldn't hit it
if I had a sofa cushion.

14:46.087 --> 14:49.921
All right, so softball's
not your game. It's no big deal.

14:50.087 --> 14:53.682
MARTIN: Freddie will understand that.
FRASIER: I suppose in time he will.

14:53.847 --> 14:55.519
It's just that... Ow, ow, ow, ow.

14:58.967 --> 15:03.165
No boy ever forgets the first time
he learns that his dad isn't perfect.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.486
It's not what I wanted him
to take away with him on this trip.

15:06.687 --> 15:09.599
- Anyway, thanks for your help.
- Oh, don't mention it.

15:10.207 --> 15:12.402
So, Frasier...

15:13.327 --> 15:15.158
...what was it for you?
- Huh?

15:15.367 --> 15:16.800
Well, you know, I mean,

15:17.207 --> 15:20.517
when you first found out
that I was less than perfect.

15:21.527 --> 15:22.516
I don't know.

15:22.727 --> 15:25.844
Well, I thought you said
a kid never forgets the first time.

15:26.007 --> 15:28.521
- Maybe it was no one time.
- Oh, so it was a lot of times?

15:28.687 --> 15:30.643
No. I'm not very comfortable
talking about it...

15:30.847 --> 15:33.281
Well, why? You're not gonna hurt
my feelings. I'm just curious.

15:33.487 --> 15:35.079
All right, all right.

15:35.687 --> 15:37.882
Back in third grade.

15:38.047 --> 15:41.756
You took me and some of the boys
from the math club out for pizza.

15:43.447 --> 15:45.517
When the check came...

15:46.847 --> 15:49.361
...you couldn't figure out
the tip in your head.

15:50.527 --> 15:51.960
I can't do math in my head?

15:52.127 --> 15:55.119
- That's your big disappointment?
- Well, it was at the time.

15:55.327 --> 15:58.319
Well, I wonder if I can calculate in my
head how many hits you got today.

15:58.487 --> 16:00.796
Let me think. Oh, zero!

16:00.967 --> 16:03.435
Fine! Fine, Dad, get defensive.
I was 8 years old.

16:03.607 --> 16:06.075
Eight. That's the one shaped
like the snowman, right?

16:06.287 --> 16:08.403
I'm sorry I even brought it up. God.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.605
Guess I'm gonna
have to bite the bullet,

16:12.767 --> 16:17.158
sit Frederick down on Saturday
before the game and tell him the truth.

16:19.087 --> 16:22.363
Not a conversation I'm looking forward
to, but I should prepare him for the fact

16:23.247 --> 16:26.717
his daddy's not gonna be hitting
any grand slams on Saturday.

16:28.647 --> 16:30.080
Or am I? Wait.

16:30.247 --> 16:32.363
- A grand slam is?
- You aren't.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.315
Well, anyway, I suppose that
one consolation is, you know,

16:38.487 --> 16:40.762
as disappointed as I was
with you after the pizza incident,

16:40.967 --> 16:44.118
yet here we are, all these
years later, out in a batting cage.

16:44.287 --> 16:46.755
Yeah, that's right. Come on,
I'll get us a couple of beers.

16:46.927 --> 16:48.076
FRASIER: Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

16:48.247 --> 16:51.284
And how many
of these shiny things...?

16:51.447 --> 16:53.483
FRASIER:
Oh, shut up.

[DOORBELL CHIMES]

16:57.367 --> 17:01.042
- Hello, Niles.
- You look like an authentic jock.

17:01.247 --> 17:03.761
I'm half tempted to hand over
my lunch money.

17:04.327 --> 17:07.922
Is that your idea of appropriate
baseball-watching attire?

17:08.127 --> 17:11.118
Obviously you failed to detect
the subtle diamond pattern in my tie.

17:11.287 --> 17:12.560
Oh.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.602
So how did your little talk go
with Frederick?

17:18.767 --> 17:22.396
Well, I haven't been able to
bring myself to do it yet.

17:22.567 --> 17:25.525
As a father, you go to any lengths to
avoid looking foolish before your son.

17:26.047 --> 17:28.196
Look what Mrs Thorgeson
was throwing out.

17:28.406 --> 17:31.604
Boy, the guys at McGinty's
are gonna love this.

17:36.127 --> 17:38.402
Well, anyhow...

17:39.927 --> 17:41.963
What have I told you about
running in the house?

17:42.127 --> 17:43.560
You told me to never run
in the house.

17:43.727 --> 17:45.479
Good, and what about
splitting infinitives?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.684
Frasier, let the boy be a boy.

17:48.887 --> 17:50.445
Don't run away. I saw you.

17:50.607 --> 17:53.201
Your son just walked right in
on me in the shower.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.238
- Frederick.
- Dad, all I really saw was...

17:55.407 --> 17:57.045
I am very disappointed in you,
young man.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.636
Let the boy finish.

18:05.087 --> 18:08.443
All I really saw was a lot of steam.

18:08.607 --> 18:11.440
I'm sorry, Daphne.
I didn't know you were in the shower.

18:11.607 --> 18:13.996
- Now you hate me.
- I don't hate you.

18:14.167 --> 18:18.285
You just have to promise to knock
before you enter a room, okay?

18:19.047 --> 18:22.164
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay, son.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.801
So when are we going to the game?

18:25.527 --> 18:26.801
In a bit.

18:26.967 --> 18:29.640
First we have to have a little
conversation, the two of us.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.838
Uncle Niles, could you
give us a moment alone?

18:32.007 --> 18:33.963
Oh, of course.
I'll freshen up for the game.

18:34.127 --> 18:35.242
[NILES CLEARING THROAT]

18:35.407 --> 18:38.763
You can fool them,
but you can't fool me.

18:40.847 --> 18:44.044
I'm onto you, little man.

18:49.847 --> 18:53.601
Come on, Freddie.
Come and have a seat here.

18:55.207 --> 18:56.959
Okay.

18:57.807 --> 19:00.879
You're gonna see me play
some softball today.

19:01.527 --> 19:04.041
And I'm not gonna play very well.

19:04.847 --> 19:08.157
- See, I'm not a good softball player.
- But Bulldog said you were the best.

19:08.327 --> 19:12.639
Yes, I know. Well, he was
just lying in order to be nice.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.759
The truth is I stink.

19:14.927 --> 19:17.236
I can't catch, I can't throw, I can't hit.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.205
Oh.

19:20.447 --> 19:23.007
So it must be pretty disappointing
to hear for the first time

19:23.167 --> 19:26.557
- that your dad is not perfect, huh?
- It's not the first time.

19:28.487 --> 19:30.159
You couldn't fix my computer.

19:30.327 --> 19:33.239
You thought Venus
was the North Star.

19:33.447 --> 19:36.325
And I've seen you run.

19:39.287 --> 19:42.404
Well, why didn't you mention
any of these things to me before?

19:42.607 --> 19:45.758
I thought it might hurt
your self-esteem.

19:46.967 --> 19:50.039
Actually, Frederick, I'm really
okay with those things. I am.

19:50.207 --> 19:52.801
I want you to know that it's okay
for you to feel bad about them.

19:53.207 --> 19:56.199
See, when I was about your age,
I felt real bad about learning

19:56.367 --> 19:58.403
that your grandpa
can't do math in his head.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.956
I learned later, of course,
that that wasn't very important,

20:01.127 --> 20:03.038
because he can do
so many other things so well.

20:03.247 --> 20:07.286
- Grandpa can't do math in his head?
FRASIER: Yes, well, see...

20:08.847 --> 20:11.281
- That's not the issue.
- Why did you go and tell him that for?

20:11.447 --> 20:14.803
- Well, I was illustrating a point.
- You mean, you can't do it at all?

20:15.007 --> 20:17.919
- Well, yeah, sure I can, Freddie.
- I knew you could.

20:18.087 --> 20:20.442
What's seven times 15?

20:20.607 --> 20:22.882
You can do it, Grandpa.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.842
- 115?
FREDERICK: Oh, Grandpa.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.919
- Well, thanks a lot, Frasier.
- Well, I tried, for God's sake.

20:29.087 --> 20:31.476
DAPHNE: Ready for the game?
- Yeah.

20:31.687 --> 20:33.040
You don't sound too excited.

20:33.207 --> 20:35.675
I just found out Dad's bad at softball

20:35.847 --> 20:37.997
and Grandpa
can't do math in his head.

20:38.447 --> 20:42.156
Those things aren't important.
What can I do to make you feel better?

20:42.367 --> 20:45.359
- Maybe a hug?
- Oh, come here.

Oh. There you go.
