00:45.171 --> 00:48.883
<i>There's a place I've
been avoiding for a long time.</i>

00:51.720 --> 00:55.807
<i>It's been in my thoughts
for more than 40 years.</i>

00:58.935 --> 01:03.982
<i>What happened there long ago
set me on this path.</i>

01:07.110 --> 01:10.113
<i>There are still lots
of unanswered questions</i>

01:10.321 --> 01:13.908
<i>and I'm not sure I'll find
what I'm looking for.</i>

01:16.494 --> 01:20.540
<i>And this journey, it all
started with my father's story.</i>

01:25.462 --> 01:27.964
We have made a national pledge.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.883
<i>My father was a pilot</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:32.427
<i>and he was shot down
during the Vietnam War.</i>

01:32.635 --> 01:35.221
<i>We did not choose
to be the guardians of the gate.</i>

01:35.430 --> 01:37.515
<i>Communism is a threat
we cannot afford to ignore.</i>

01:37.724 --> 01:39.768
<i>The spread of
communism is imminent.</i>

01:39.976 --> 01:44.606
<i>I was just 3 years
old, and I never knew him,</i>

01:44.814 --> 01:48.401
<i>and he was missing in action
for a really long time.</i>

01:48.610 --> 01:51.905
<i>We do not want an
expanding struggle with consequences</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:53.907
that no one can perceive.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.910
<i>My mom raised my sister
and I as a single parent.</i>

01:57.118 --> 01:58.620
<i>A nation divided.</i>

01:58.828 --> 02:00.288
<i>This war will have ramifications</i>

02:00.497 --> 02:02.207
<i>on this country for generations.</i>

02:02.415 --> 02:07.462
<i>And we never really
knew if he was alive,</i>

02:07.670 --> 02:09.547
<i>if he was a prisoner of war,</i>

02:09.756 --> 02:12.717
<i>or if he died that day.</i>

02:12.926 --> 02:16.596
All American prisoners of war
will be released.

02:16.805 --> 02:19.057
<i>They will soon join
the army of the forgotten.</i>

02:19.265 --> 02:20.975
<i>Over 30 years later,</i>

02:21.184 --> 02:24.354
<i>a search and recovery mission
identified the crash site</i>

02:24.562 --> 02:26.314
<i>and found my father's remains.</i>

02:28.525 --> 02:33.404
<i>And now I feel drawn
to go looking for answers,</i>

02:33.613 --> 02:36.324
<i>to a mystery that's been
with me my entire life.</i>

03:07.063 --> 03:09.774
<i>I've been a professional
athlete for most of my life,</i>

03:09.983 --> 03:14.028
<i>and that involves
continually prepping, training,</i>

03:14.237 --> 03:17.532
preparing for some sort
of adventure or race.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.951
I'm pretty much always getting
ready for the next thing.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.666
<i>Rebecca, growing up, was
always attracted to challenge,</i>

03:26.875 --> 03:29.961
and she was always
doing things outside...

03:30.170 --> 03:31.754
Riding a bike, roller-skating,

03:31.921 --> 03:35.049
<i>ice-skating on the pond,
riding ponies at the fair.</i>

03:35.258 --> 03:37.844
<i>We went camping all the time.</i>

03:38.052 --> 03:41.181
<i>It might have, at an early age,
started instilling the love</i>

03:41.389 --> 03:44.267
<i>of what you can appreciate
out there.</i>

03:48.104 --> 03:50.315
<i>Everyone who competes
at really extreme sports</i>

03:50.523 --> 03:52.650
<i>like adventure racing,
climbing, ultra biking,</i>

03:52.859 --> 03:54.444
<i>all these kind of sports,</i>

03:54.652 --> 03:56.946
<i>requires a very high
tolerance to pain.</i>

03:57.155 --> 03:59.699
And consequently,
to participate in these races,

03:59.908 --> 04:02.327
<i>it was mostly by passion
and sacrifice.</i>

04:03.661 --> 04:05.163
<i>No matter how good you are,</i>

04:05.371 --> 04:06.998
<i>people who do these sports
have another job</i>

04:07.207 --> 04:08.499
<i>because they just don't pay.</i>

04:08.708 --> 04:11.544
Back to my other job,
riding bikes.

04:11.753 --> 04:17.132
Four-time Leadville
100 champion, Rebecca RUSCH!

04:17.341 --> 04:20.386
<i>Rebecca has
become a top athlete,</i>

04:20.595 --> 04:22.764
<i>whereas I went
into the Air Force,</i>

04:22.972 --> 04:25.391
<i>but yet you look
at our similarities.</i>

04:25.600 --> 04:27.727
We're both very, very driven.

04:27.936 --> 04:29.979
We both have
probably more energy

04:30.188 --> 04:31.940
<i>than a lot of people
can tolerate.</i>

04:32.148 --> 04:34.984
We're both on a path
to find our dad.

04:42.242 --> 04:46.412
<i>All of my life, I've
learned if I prepare properly,</i>

04:46.621 --> 04:51.376
<i>I can do almost anything
that I set my mind to achieve.</i>

04:51.584 --> 04:53.962
<i>But this challenge,</i>

04:54.170 --> 04:56.256
<i>this is totally different.</i>

04:59.550 --> 05:02.971
<i>My father's plane was shot down
over the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

05:03.179 --> 05:06.015
<i>The trail is a massive
braided network</i>

05:06.224 --> 05:09.519
<i>that runs through Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia.</i>

05:09.727 --> 05:12.897
<i>There are a ton of unknowns
I'm gonna need help with,</i>

05:13.106 --> 05:15.900
<i>so I'm putting together
a team with a support crew</i>

05:16.109 --> 05:18.945
<i>and a riding partner to piece
this whole thing together.</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:21.614
It'll be good to have somebody
that knows the area,

05:21.823 --> 05:22.657
speaks the language.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.200
Yeah.

05:24.409 --> 05:25.952
<i>I've known Rebecca
for over 10 years.</i>

05:26.160 --> 05:27.704
<i>She's had
a great deal of success</i>

05:27.912 --> 05:29.580
<i>as an athlete
in multiple sports.</i>

05:29.789 --> 05:31.207
This trip is something different

05:31.416 --> 05:33.376
than anything she's done
previously,

05:33.584 --> 05:35.628
and I hope she finds
what she's looking for.

05:35.837 --> 05:40.967
<i>The logistics for this
journey are incredibly complex...</i>

05:41.175 --> 05:42.510
<i>The time on the bike,</i>

05:42.719 --> 05:44.304
<i>distance traveled,
the heat of the jungle.</i>

05:44.512 --> 05:46.556
This'll be one of the more
difficult undertakings

05:46.764 --> 05:47.932
that Rebecca's gone through.

05:48.141 --> 05:50.685
<i>My father's plane went down</i>

05:50.893 --> 05:53.646
<i>on March 7th, 1972.</i>

05:53.855 --> 05:56.482
<i>My goal is
to find his crash site,</i>

05:56.691 --> 05:59.485
<i>and be there on the anniversary
of his death,</i>

05:59.694 --> 06:02.196
<i>as my way to honor his memory.</i>

06:06.117 --> 06:09.287
<i>By riding my bike there,
I will see more,</i>

06:09.495 --> 06:10.872
<i>discover more,</i>

06:11.080 --> 06:14.959
<i>fully immerse myself
in the place, in...</i>

06:15.168 --> 06:17.795
<i>In some sort of way
to connect with him.</i>

06:20.173 --> 06:21.466
You driving?

06:21.674 --> 06:23.634
I'll drive.
Okay.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.474
<i>This trip, hands down,</i>

06:29.682 --> 06:32.143
<i>will be the biggest undertaking,</i>

06:32.352 --> 06:37.065
<i>the most ambitious thing
that I've ever attempted,</i>

06:37.273 --> 06:40.526
<i>and I hope I'll actually be
able to find his crash site.</i>

06:47.241 --> 06:50.119
<i>"June 5th, 1971.</i>

06:50.328 --> 06:53.873
<i>"Dear Judy, Sharon, and Becky,</i>

06:54.082 --> 06:55.708
<i>"I left California on Tuesday</i>

06:55.917 --> 06:57.502
<i>"and spent 18 hours</i>

06:57.710 --> 07:00.880
<i>"getting to the Philippines
via Alaska and Japan.</i>

07:01.089 --> 07:04.175
<i>"It is not a trip
that I would care to do again.</i>

07:04.384 --> 07:06.677
<i>"I have almost a week here
for survival school,</i>

07:06.886 --> 07:08.679
<i>"and then I'm off to Da Nang
and serious stuff</i>

07:08.888 --> 07:10.640
<i>"for most of next year.</i>

07:10.848 --> 07:12.225
<i>"I'd like to hear from you</i>

07:12.433 --> 07:14.227
<i>"a little more often
about the children.</i>

07:14.435 --> 07:17.105
<i>"This is not easy for me
and that'll help.</i>

07:18.523 --> 07:21.025
<i>Be good. Steve."</i>

07:27.448 --> 07:29.117
<i>In order to get to the site</i>

07:29.325 --> 07:30.493
<i>on the anniversary</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:31.994
<i>of my father's crash,</i>

07:32.203 --> 07:33.788
<i>we arrived in Hanoi</i>

07:33.996 --> 07:35.665
<i>during the Vietnamese New Year.</i>

07:35.873 --> 07:38.626
<i>I was anxious about
meeting my new teammate</i>

07:38.835 --> 07:40.420
<i>and embarking
on such a big adventure</i>

07:40.628 --> 07:42.588
<i>with a total stranger.</i>

07:42.797 --> 07:46.134
<i>But I knew that riding
with someone from this area</i>

07:46.342 --> 07:49.846
<i>could be a bridge to the
culture and really help me</i>

07:50.054 --> 07:51.139
<i>understand what went on here.</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:08.030
<i>When I heard about this project,</i>

08:08.239 --> 08:10.491
<i>I felt excited,</i>

08:10.700 --> 08:13.077
because, for the nation
and people of Vietnam,

08:13.286 --> 08:15.872
the Ho Chi Minh Trail
is a historical path,

08:16.080 --> 08:18.082
<i>a link on the path
to independence</i>

08:18.291 --> 08:20.251
<i>and freedom
for our entire nation.</i>

08:20.460 --> 08:22.753
<i>And lots of Vietnamese
people's blood</i>

08:22.962 --> 08:24.547
<i>has been shed on this road.</i>

08:24.755 --> 08:29.135
<i>It is indeed a journey
that I believe</i>

08:29.343 --> 08:31.220
will be exciting and meaningful.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.855
Hello.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.736
<i>I started biking when I was 16.</i>

08:46.944 --> 08:49.280
<i>I became a cyclist
and was determined</i>

08:49.489 --> 08:52.533
<i>to become
the best biker in Vietnam.</i>

08:55.036 --> 08:56.996
<i>Huyen is an athlete</i>

08:57.205 --> 09:00.291
<i>who was an idol
in Vietnamese cycling.</i>

09:00.500 --> 09:05.046
Because Huyen won four Southeast
Asia Games gold medals,

09:05.254 --> 09:06.839
in four consecutive events.

09:07.048 --> 09:12.053
<i>For an athlete in Vietnam,
there has never been one</i>

09:12.261 --> 09:14.805
<i>who claimed such a record.</i>

09:21.229 --> 09:24.023
<i>After putting an end
to my competing career,</i>

09:24.232 --> 09:27.151
<i>I became a coach.</i>

09:33.449 --> 09:35.243
<i>I've heard a lot about</i>

09:35.451 --> 09:36.994
<i>the Ho Chi Minh Trail
since childhood.</i>

09:37.203 --> 09:40.331
<i>Not until now
does my dream of riding</i>

09:40.540 --> 09:44.001
<i>on the Ho Chi Minh Trail
come true.</i>

09:44.210 --> 09:46.629
<i>I am quite nervous,
but also excited about it.</i>

10:03.771 --> 10:05.815
Hi, Rebecca.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.150
I was looking for a long time.

10:08.359 --> 10:10.945
Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.447
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for having me.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.866
These are for you.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.577
Thank you so much.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.621
I'm very sorry because
my English is not very good.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.541
Well, my Vietnamese sucks,
so your English is better.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.085
So happy to meet you.

10:26.294 --> 10:27.753
Yeah, you too.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.093
Rebecca, this is my father.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.845
This is Rebecca.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.763
It's nice to meet you.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.932
<i>Both my uncle and my father</i>

10:40.141 --> 10:41.726
<i>experienced
the American Resistance war.</i>

10:41.934 --> 10:46.355
<i>At that time,
America was our enemy.</i>

10:48.899 --> 10:52.069
<i>One big problem is how</i>

10:52.278 --> 10:55.406
<i>to overcome
barriers among people,</i>

10:55.615 --> 10:58.075
<i>to connect
their hearts and souls</i>

10:58.284 --> 11:00.161
<i>so they can
understand each other.</i>

11:00.369 --> 11:02.163
Happy New Year.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.166
Thank you for
making all this food. It's beautiful.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.210
<i>Huyen's father and my father</i>

11:08.419 --> 11:10.796
<i>indirectly fought
each other in the war,</i>

11:11.005 --> 11:14.592
<i>and it's extraordinary,
more than 40 years later,</i>

11:14.800 --> 11:17.011
<i>that we can all sit down
at the dinner table</i>

11:17.219 --> 11:18.721
<i>and share a meal together.</i>

11:18.929 --> 11:22.516
Cheers. Happy New Year,
Happy New Year.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.852
<i>To a good journey. Yeah.</i>

11:31.776 --> 11:34.278
<i>Our last major
challenge before starting</i>

11:34.487 --> 11:36.030
<i>is mapping out the trail</i>

11:36.238 --> 11:37.990
<i>and trying to make sense</i>

11:38.199 --> 11:39.700
<i>of the complex route.</i>

11:45.039 --> 11:47.875
<i>Don Duvall is an American
living in Laos.</i>

11:48.084 --> 11:50.336
<i>He has spent most of his life</i>

11:50.544 --> 11:53.089
<i>exploring and mapping
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

11:53.297 --> 11:57.343
<i>He is an essential part
of our expedition because</i>

11:57.551 --> 11:59.011
he has really helped create

11:59.220 --> 12:02.264
the most historically
accurate route for us to take.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.600
<i>My background is
navigating sailing yachts</i>

12:04.809 --> 12:06.811
<i>around the world
for almost 15 years,</i>

12:07.019 --> 12:09.522
<i>and then I came
to Laos and started</i>

12:09.730 --> 12:11.232
<i>map-making and surveying
on a motorcycle</i>

12:11.440 --> 12:13.109
<i>on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

12:13.317 --> 12:14.819
<i>My role here with Rebecca's team</i>

12:15.027 --> 12:16.987
<i>is to help them with navigation,</i>

12:17.196 --> 12:21.033
provide GPS maps and local
knowledge and information.

12:21.242 --> 12:22.243
Where we can camp,

12:22.451 --> 12:24.245
<i>what rivers we can go across.</i>

12:24.453 --> 12:27.415
I'm gonna assist them
as a guide,

12:27.623 --> 12:29.875
and also with navigation.

12:30.084 --> 12:31.752
Very long.

12:31.961 --> 12:34.380
<i>Yeah. Explaining to
the ladies about the trail,</i>

12:34.588 --> 12:36.507
<i>honestly, I was a bit skeptical.</i>

12:36.716 --> 12:38.968
<i>I've been riding up and down.
There are tough places.</i>

12:39.176 --> 12:41.679
<i>No one's ever taken a bike
and done the full thing</i>

12:41.887 --> 12:44.265
<i>from start to finish.</i>

12:44.473 --> 12:47.101
<i>First off, the
mileage is off the charts.</i>

12:47.309 --> 12:48.853
<i>We are attempting to ride</i>

12:49.061 --> 12:52.106
<i>more than 1200 miles
of unknown terrain.</i>

12:52.314 --> 12:54.734
<i>It should take
about three weeks.</i>

12:54.942 --> 12:57.778
<i>And to top it all off,
we're trying to find</i>

12:57.987 --> 12:59.947
<i>a more than
40-year-old crash site</i>

13:00.156 --> 13:01.866
<i>in the middle
of the dense jungle.</i>

13:02.074 --> 13:03.659
<i>The site was already excavated.</i>

13:03.868 --> 13:06.245
<i>It's a large area to search,
a lot of jungle.</i>

13:06.454 --> 13:08.164
There'd be
a very small possibility

13:08.372 --> 13:10.583
of any evidence of
the actual crash itself.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.626
The idea is,
you know, we'll have

13:12.835 --> 13:14.587
these guys
in a small support rig

13:14.795 --> 13:17.339
that we'll meet
at certain points along the way.

13:17.548 --> 13:18.883
That's gonna take planning.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.342
We're gonna sit down with...

13:20.551 --> 13:22.428
There's places
your bicycle can go

13:22.636 --> 13:24.889
that they won't be able to.
There'll be leap frogs.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.515
In between those places,

13:26.724 --> 13:28.267
we need to be
totally self-sufficient

13:28.476 --> 13:29.810
for bike maintenance,

13:30.019 --> 13:31.937
whatever might
come our way, so...

13:32.146 --> 13:33.939
Yeah, there'll be
some leap-frogging.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.441
We have a little work to do

13:35.649 --> 13:37.485
to actually look
at your whole route

13:37.693 --> 13:40.780
<i>and make a master plan
for the weeks ahead.</i>

13:57.755 --> 14:00.049
Yeah, easier. Yeah.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.718
We can grind down
the shoe a little bit.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.011
The watts down here.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.555
All right.
Zero watts right now.

14:06.764 --> 14:10.893
And then this screen over here's
got my little map on there.

14:26.367 --> 14:29.036
<i>My experience as a
professional athlete, you know.</i>

14:29.245 --> 14:32.498
<i>Get from point A to B
as fast as humanly possible.</i>

14:32.706 --> 14:34.166
<i>And this is a little different.</i>

14:34.375 --> 14:38.087
So for this ride,
we're a team, okay?

14:38.295 --> 14:39.839
We are a team.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.050
I will always be beside you.
Okay.

14:43.259 --> 14:45.344
<i>I'm riding with a picture</i>

14:45.553 --> 14:48.389
<i>of my father in my backpack.</i>

14:48.597 --> 14:51.559
<i>And before
we started our journey,</i>

14:51.767 --> 14:54.520
<i>I really wanted
to share with Huyen</i>

14:54.728 --> 14:58.607
<i>that my reason
for being here is for him.</i>

14:58.816 --> 15:01.777
<i>It's not really about me.
It's to honor his memory.</i>

15:01.986 --> 15:04.405
<i>So I wanted to bring her in</i>

15:04.613 --> 15:07.867
<i>and really help her
understand why I'm here.</i>

15:14.373 --> 15:16.500
Ready? Okay.

15:23.799 --> 15:28.596
<i>In the past,
I would imagine a U.S. soldier</i>

15:28.804 --> 15:32.391
<i>dropping bombs
to kill my compatriots.</i>

15:32.600 --> 15:34.143
<i>I had never thought of
her father</i>

15:34.351 --> 15:36.395
<i>in the photograph
as an actual person.</i>

15:40.149 --> 15:44.445
<i>I thought that he was
just one of war's victims.</i>

15:44.653 --> 15:46.864
<i>Just like Rebecca's family.</i>

15:59.710 --> 16:02.338
<i>After years of preparation,</i>

16:02.546 --> 16:04.214
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

16:04.423 --> 16:07.217
<i>I don't know what
we're gonna find out there,</i>

16:07.426 --> 16:11.972
<i>or whether or not we'll even
find my father's crash site.</i>

16:21.899 --> 16:25.235
<i>The Ho Chi Minh Trail
is a 10,000-mile-long network</i>

16:25.444 --> 16:27.821
<i>of interconnected
paths and roads</i>

16:28.030 --> 16:30.366
<i>crisscrossing the dense jungles
and rugged mountains</i>

16:30.574 --> 16:34.620
<i>of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</i>

16:34.828 --> 16:38.457
<i>The trail, named for Vietnamese
communist leader Ho Chi Minh,</i>

16:38.666 --> 16:42.002
<i>was primarily used to secretly
move military troops</i>

16:42.211 --> 16:44.380
<i>and supplies
during times of conflict...</i>

16:47.049 --> 16:49.802
<i>most notably during the war
with the United States</i>

16:50.010 --> 16:52.888
<i>from 1964 to 1975.</i>

16:54.807 --> 16:57.017
<i>At that time,
a treaty temporarily</i>

16:57.226 --> 16:59.228
<i>split Vietnam
into two countries...</i>

16:59.436 --> 17:01.480
<i>North and South Vietnam.</i>

17:01.689 --> 17:04.273
<i>The communist North sought
to reunite the South,</i>

17:04.483 --> 17:07.152
<i>but the U.S. government
feared the Domino Theory,</i>

17:07.361 --> 17:09.530
<i>which could lead
to other communist takeovers</i>

17:09.738 --> 17:11.615
<i>within the region.</i>

17:11.824 --> 17:14.367
<i>In order to help South Vietnam
fight off the North</i>

17:14.576 --> 17:16.161
<i>and the spread of communism,</i>

17:16.369 --> 17:19.957
<i>the U.S. sent arms,
aid, and eventually troops.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:22.584
<i>The North Vietnamese knew</i>

17:22.792 --> 17:24.336
<i>the Americans
had superior firepower,</i>

17:24.545 --> 17:27.006
<i>so they resorted
to guerrilla warfare tactics,</i>

17:27.214 --> 17:29.258
<i>while secretly
transporting supplies</i>

17:29.466 --> 17:31.552
<i>on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

17:31.760 --> 17:33.345
<i>Initially, the North Vietnamese</i>

17:33.554 --> 17:36.432
<i>primarily used bicycles, troops,</i>

17:36.640 --> 17:40.436
<i>and even elephants to move
supplies along the trail.</i>

17:40.644 --> 17:42.104
<i>But as the war intensified,</i>

17:42.312 --> 17:45.858
<i>they realized
the trail needed to expand.</i>

18:04.793 --> 18:08.088
My uncle and
my father tell about the war.

18:08.297 --> 18:14.428
<i>The bomb
on Kham Thien Street in 1972.</i>

18:14.636 --> 18:17.681
<i>At that time
my father, every day,</i>

18:17.890 --> 18:20.517
<i>he go to Kham Thien Street</i>

18:20.726 --> 18:26.190
and collect a lot of bodies

18:26.398 --> 18:28.400
of many, many people,

18:28.609 --> 18:30.194
<i>everywhere.</i>

18:30.402 --> 18:32.571
<i>And in my garden,</i>

18:32.780 --> 18:34.239
there's a big hole.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.492
Now, there's still a hole?

18:36.700 --> 18:37.785
Hole from bomb.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.745
Why didn't he put dirt

18:39.953 --> 18:42.664
in the hole, to make it go away?

18:42.873 --> 18:45.125
Because many fish live there.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.127
The fish live in the bomb hole?

18:47.336 --> 18:48.837
Yes.
In the crater.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.343
You know, that same year, 1972,

18:54.551 --> 18:56.220
is the same year my father died.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.055
My...

18:58.263 --> 18:59.765
Yeah, your father died.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.183
'72.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.460
You need more food
to take with you?

19:28.669 --> 19:30.087
No. No,
it's enough.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.380
You have enough, okay.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.048
It could go nose down more.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.341
Yeah.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.718
It's a vegetable.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.929
Very good for health.

19:39.138 --> 19:40.264
Very good.

19:42.891 --> 19:47.104
So you're back
a little less than a centimeter.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.022
All right, thank you, guys.
All right.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.882
Okay. Let's go.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.091
How do I say it in...?

20:18.594 --> 20:21.263
<i>I'm guessing we can
probably catch them at 40K.</i>

20:21.471 --> 20:24.391
And then another 864 hours.

20:28.979 --> 20:32.107
Whoo!

20:32.316 --> 20:34.359
You can see the head.
It's a head.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.945
That's a head.
Do people eat the eyeballs?

20:37.154 --> 20:38.113
Yes.
Yeah?

21:05.432 --> 21:06.975
Here?

21:07.184 --> 21:08.310
Excuse me?

21:08.518 --> 21:09.478
Hello?

21:09.686 --> 21:10.687
Excuse me?

21:13.565 --> 21:15.400
Oh, this one. Okay.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.819
There's not really
a line system here.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.863
Oh, where's my passport?

21:20.072 --> 21:22.366
Where's yours?

21:22.574 --> 21:24.284
Make sure nobody has it.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.787
Excuse me?
My passport.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.045
Thank you.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.726
<i>As soon as we crossed the border</i>

21:49.935 --> 21:52.145
<i>into Laos, I felt different.</i>

21:52.354 --> 21:54.314
<i>It was really cool
to just look around</i>

21:54.523 --> 21:56.191
<i>and soak in the atmosphere</i>

21:56.358 --> 21:59.069
<i>and feel like I was finally
moving closer to my goal.</i>

21:59.278 --> 22:02.197
<i>Instead of just thinking about
it and dreaming about it,</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:05.617
<i>I was actually doing it
and making progress.</i>

22:14.251 --> 22:21.174
<i>So far, the
biggest challenge to me is my stamina.</i>

22:21.383 --> 22:23.093
<i>And the thing I worry about
the most,</i>

22:23.302 --> 22:24.886
<i>that I ponder a lot about,</i>

22:25.095 --> 22:29.725
<i>it's how to become
a real friend to Rebecca.</i>

22:59.212 --> 23:02.174
<i>"Dear Judy, Sharon and Becky,</i>

23:04.176 --> 23:06.511
<i>"I'm what they call
the weapons systems operator</i>

23:06.720 --> 23:10.223
<i>"in the back seat of the F-4E
Phantom fighter jet.</i>

23:10.432 --> 23:14.811
<i>"What we're really called is
a GIB, for 'guy in the back.'</i>

23:15.020 --> 23:17.606
<i>"Aside from being responsible
for navigation,</i>

23:17.814 --> 23:20.317
<i>"we do just about everything
the pilot does.</i>

23:20.525 --> 23:23.028
<i>"We can carry just about
any type of weapon made,</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:24.571
<i>"but a normal load would be</i>

23:24.780 --> 23:27.157
<i>"about three tons
of bombs or napalm.</i>

23:27.366 --> 23:29.159
<i>"We generally
release that at speeds</i>

23:29.368 --> 23:32.120
<i>"ranging from
about 400 to 600 knots.</i>

23:32.329 --> 23:36.041
<i>"The ground really comes up
at you pretty fast.</i>

23:36.249 --> 23:38.627
<i>"I usually fly
about twice a day,</i>

23:38.835 --> 23:40.921
<i>"which is quite exhausting.</i>

23:41.129 --> 23:42.923
<i>"There is no such thing
as a day off.</i>

23:43.131 --> 23:46.385
<i>"We work seven days
a week all year.</i>

23:46.593 --> 23:49.638
<i>"It does make the time
go faster, however.</i>

23:49.846 --> 23:52.557
<i>Be good. Steve."</i>

23:57.312 --> 23:58.980
Stephen was a heck of a guy.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.149
I can't call him Stephen.
He was Steve.

24:01.358 --> 24:02.818
<i>Steve was a heck of a guy.</i>

24:03.026 --> 24:04.403
<i>He went to Vietnam.</i>

24:04.611 --> 24:06.571
<i>He didn't want to go to Vietnam.</i>

24:06.780 --> 24:08.448
<i>Nobody wants to go to war,</i>

24:08.657 --> 24:10.325
but it was his duty,

24:10.534 --> 24:13.495
and he was gonna do it
to the best of his ability.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.664
<i>In Rebecca,
I see a lot of her dad.</i>

24:15.872 --> 24:19.042
<i>I see a lot of Steve
in a lot of different ways.</i>

24:19.251 --> 24:21.002
<i>She loves animals,
she loves pets,</i>

24:21.211 --> 24:23.171
<i>and her dad did too,
just adored them.</i>

24:23.380 --> 24:27.759
She definitely has a wanderlust
the way her dad did.

24:27.968 --> 24:32.431
<i>She definitely wants to do
things outside, not inside.</i>

24:32.639 --> 24:35.559
I see those things,
and I see the seriousness.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.478
<i>Steve was a serious guy,
he wasn't a goof-off.</i>

24:38.687 --> 24:41.440
<i>And Rebecca's got
a very serious mode,</i>

24:41.648 --> 24:45.318
<i>and her dad was
very much the same way.</i>

24:53.994 --> 24:56.246
One big climb
and then here a river.

24:56.455 --> 24:58.290
Yeah.
Here maybe we buy

24:58.498 --> 25:00.250
some food and water.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.711
We need to really
get this secured down better.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.005
In fact,
I think I'm gonna pop this dude.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.007
<i>Meeting up with the support team</i>

25:07.215 --> 25:10.177
<i>is taking more time
than I thought.</i>

25:10.385 --> 25:12.304
We have a hard cutoff

25:12.512 --> 25:15.432
to get to the end of
the riding and get on a boat.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.602
<i>Given the schedule</i>

25:18.810 --> 25:20.103
<i>and the goal
that I've set for us,</i>

25:20.312 --> 25:21.813
<i>we're gonna have to figure out</i>

25:22.022 --> 25:23.732
<i>a better rhythm
in order to make it</i>

25:23.940 --> 25:25.609
<i>to the crash site
on the anniversary.</i>

25:25.817 --> 25:27.319
<i>If we don't make this cutoff,</i>

25:27.527 --> 25:29.196
that's gonna put us behind
the next day

25:29.404 --> 25:30.947
<i>and the next day
and the next day.</i>

25:31.156 --> 25:33.325
<i>Time's ticking!</i>

25:42.083 --> 25:46.421
<i>It finally feels like this
is truly the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

25:46.630 --> 25:50.842
<i>There's a simplicity to it.
The terrain is different.</i>

25:51.051 --> 25:53.303
<i>This is where I wanted to be.</i>

25:56.848 --> 25:58.475
Whoo-hoo!

26:03.855 --> 26:05.232
Nope. Yeah. This way.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.192
I just have to move the map.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.444
<i>♪ In the month of August ♪</i>

26:09.653 --> 26:11.446
<i>♪ Mary loves Sally the most ♪</i>

26:51.027 --> 26:52.696
Shit.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.282
I just got a vine on my neck.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.368
It stopped my bike.
Holy shit.

26:58.577 --> 27:01.705
<i>The authentic jungle
took a bite out of me.</i>

27:01.913 --> 27:05.375
I was... Heh. Rode through,
basically a lasso. Err!

27:05.584 --> 27:07.711
<i>I tried to strangle myself
on the trail.</i>

27:07.919 --> 27:12.299
But yeah, it really did a number
on my neck and my face, so...

27:38.491 --> 27:40.035
<i>The girls used a boat</i>

27:40.243 --> 27:42.203
<i>to go across
the Nam Theun II Reservoir,</i>

27:42.412 --> 27:44.998
<i>which is an area of the flooded
Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

27:45.206 --> 27:46.166
That way?

27:46.374 --> 27:47.792
Here is an aluminum boat.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.170
This aluminum came
from the war days.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.047
<i>This was fuel tanks
that were dropped</i>

27:52.255 --> 27:54.090
<i>by the jet fighters
over the Ho Chi Minh Trail</i>

27:54.299 --> 27:56.635
<i>while they were dropping
their ordnance.</i>

27:56.843 --> 27:59.888
<i>All this war metal was used,
even the bombs.</i>

28:00.096 --> 28:01.514
<i>Anything was used
by the villagers</i>

28:01.723 --> 28:04.643
<i>for whatever
they could fabricate.</i>

28:04.851 --> 28:06.936
<i>Historically, the
trail went through there,</i>

28:07.145 --> 28:10.607
<i>so the choice was either
to ride all the way around,</i>

28:10.815 --> 28:12.817
<i>or enlist help to actually</i>

28:13.026 --> 28:14.486
<i>take a boat ride with our bikes</i>

28:14.694 --> 28:16.821
<i>across the reservoir
to the other side.</i>

28:18.740 --> 28:20.909
<i>It was the first part
of the trail</i>

28:21.117 --> 28:24.037
<i>where there was
a physical representation</i>

28:24.245 --> 28:27.082
<i>right in front of me
of pieces of the war.</i>

28:27.290 --> 28:29.417
<i>And that specific boat
was actually an F-4,</i>

28:29.626 --> 28:32.962
<i>which is the plane
that my father flew.</i>

28:39.844 --> 28:41.680
People in the war

28:41.888 --> 28:43.973
were very wonderful people.

28:44.182 --> 28:46.184
Always when a solider

28:46.393 --> 28:50.188
catches a soldier from U.S.A.,

28:50.397 --> 28:52.524
only they question.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.359
Yeah.
They question them.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.653
Vietnamese people are very kind.

29:00.740 --> 29:04.411
<i>It's been really interesting
to talk about the war.</i>

29:04.619 --> 29:07.664
<i>We call it the Vietnam War.
They call it the American war.</i>

29:07.872 --> 29:10.625
And she has what

29:10.834 --> 29:12.335
I'm sure her history books say

29:12.544 --> 29:14.796
versus what
American history books say,

29:15.004 --> 29:19.259
and I'm sure it's skewed,
and who knows what the truth is?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.719
Somewhere in the middle,
probably.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.472
<i>One of my biggest fears</i>

29:24.681 --> 29:27.434
<i>in not knowing
what happened to my father</i>

29:27.642 --> 29:29.519
<i>was that
he was a prisoner of war.</i>

29:29.728 --> 29:31.479
<i>I had nightmares about it.</i>

29:31.688 --> 29:33.565
<i>There are accounts on both sides</i>

29:33.773 --> 29:38.737
<i>of terrible treatment of
American and Vietnamese POWs,</i>

29:38.945 --> 29:40.655
<i>and I can't
even imagine how hard</i>

29:40.864 --> 29:43.074
<i>it must have been
for those soldiers.</i>

29:44.617 --> 29:46.911
<i>But across it all,</i>

29:47.120 --> 29:48.747
<i>she and I both feel
the same way,</i>

29:48.955 --> 29:50.957
<i>in that, at this point,</i>

29:51.166 --> 29:53.585
<i>there is no animosity
against the cultures.</i>

29:53.793 --> 29:56.087
<i>People are welcoming.
They're amazing here.</i>

29:56.296 --> 29:58.548
<i>And she feels
the same about Americans.</i>

29:58.757 --> 30:01.301
<i>There's none of that.</i>

30:01.509 --> 30:03.928
<i>I think to all Americans,</i>

30:04.137 --> 30:07.891
<i>whether they joined
the war or not,</i>

30:08.099 --> 30:11.352
the war has gone
and so has the past.

30:11.561 --> 30:15.398
<i>If possible,
I will do what I can</i>

30:15.607 --> 30:19.527
<i>to ease the pain of war.</i>

30:37.295 --> 30:39.672
<i>As the war escalated,
North Vietnam continued</i>

30:39.881 --> 30:42.217
<i>to improve
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i>

30:42.425 --> 30:43.843
<i>Soon it was able to accommodate</i>

30:44.052 --> 30:45.595
<i>large convoys of cargo trucks</i>

30:45.804 --> 30:48.181
<i>loaded down
with provisions and weapons,</i>

30:48.389 --> 30:49.599
<i>much of it provided by</i>

30:49.808 --> 30:51.184
<i>the Russian and Chinese
governments.</i>

30:53.019 --> 30:54.813
<i>Well aware
of the North's secret route,</i>

30:55.021 --> 30:57.482
<i>U.S. forces attempted
to halt the flow of supplies</i>

30:57.690 --> 31:01.194
<i>by creating strategic
choke points.</i>

31:01.402 --> 31:02.904
<i>But the North simply detoured</i>

31:03.112 --> 31:04.739
<i>the trail
around U.S. positions,</i>

31:04.948 --> 31:08.076
<i>moving it across the border
into Laos and Cambodia.</i>

31:09.828 --> 31:11.579
<i>The U.S. knew the trail
was being rerouted</i>

31:11.788 --> 31:13.164
<i>into neighboring countries,</i>

31:13.373 --> 31:14.833
<i>but were hesitant
to send ground troops</i>

31:15.041 --> 31:16.668
<i>into Laos and Cambodia</i>

31:16.876 --> 31:19.212
<i>because they worried that
China and the Soviet Union</i>

31:19.420 --> 31:20.880
<i>might respond by escalating</i>

31:21.089 --> 31:22.757
<i>their own involvement
in the war.</i>

31:25.885 --> 31:27.720
<i>So the American forces resorted</i>

31:27.929 --> 31:29.556
<i>to bombing
the trail from the air.</i>

31:37.188 --> 31:39.732
<i>Although the North Vietnamese
utilized thousands</i>

31:39.941 --> 31:42.235
<i>of anti-aircraft guns
to defend the trail,</i>

31:42.443 --> 31:46.489
<i>those early bombing raids
caused major damage.</i>

31:46.698 --> 31:48.283
<i>The North trail engineers
were forced</i>

31:48.491 --> 31:51.077
<i>to be resilient and resourceful.</i>

31:51.286 --> 31:53.413
<i>Whenever the Ho Chi Minh Trail
was damaged,</i>

31:53.621 --> 31:55.206
<i>they worked tirelessly
to repair it,</i>

31:55.415 --> 31:58.126
<i>and when necessary,
rerouted it elsewhere</i>

31:58.334 --> 32:00.044
<i>through the dense jungles.</i>

32:25.528 --> 32:26.779
You okay, Huyen?

32:26.988 --> 32:28.990
Okay.
Okay.

32:29.198 --> 32:32.493
Woo... Stickered vines.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.747
We're gonna be
scratched up tonight.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.752
If you see the trail,
let me know, Huyen.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.920
Yes.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.301
That's a big mushroom.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.011
Very nice.

32:50.219 --> 32:53.431
If we get stuck here all night,
we can eat it for dinner.

32:53.598 --> 32:57.393
We have to stay generally south,
so it's just gonna just...

32:57.602 --> 33:01.147
We'll just kind of stay south

33:01.356 --> 33:03.024
and hope for the best.

33:07.779 --> 33:11.032
Oh, wait, yeah, we
have to go around here.

33:22.168 --> 33:26.381
<i>The physical beatdown
that the jungle takes on you</i>

33:26.589 --> 33:29.884
<i>makes any task that you have
exponentially harder.</i>

33:30.093 --> 33:31.386
<i>It certainly did ours.</i>

33:31.594 --> 33:34.722
You okay?
Okay. I'm okay. Yeah.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.730
How do you like the sling?

33:44.899 --> 33:46.985
<i>Going up towards a protected
area in the plateau,</i>

33:47.193 --> 33:48.653
<i>I was testing the bike out.</i>

33:48.861 --> 33:51.114
<i>I made the slightest mistake.</i>

33:51.322 --> 33:53.866
<i>The front wheel went out,
and when I hit...</i>

33:54.075 --> 33:56.160
<i>One of the most common
motorcycle</i>

33:56.369 --> 33:58.121
<i>and cycling injuries is</i>

33:58.329 --> 34:00.498
a broken shoulder,
and I knew when I hit

34:00.707 --> 34:02.834
that my number was up.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.544
Not a good day for Don.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.462
You know how many
freaking kilometers I put on

34:06.671 --> 34:08.880
without a freaking injury?

34:09.090 --> 34:12.552
<i>We had thought
that he had to discontinue the role</i>

34:12.760 --> 34:15.138
<i>of guide and interpreter</i>

34:15.346 --> 34:18.141
for Rebecca and I
as well as the whole group.

34:18.349 --> 34:19.766
<i>Don was seriously hurt,</i>

34:19.976 --> 34:22.020
<i>and it's a minimum
of a day's ride</i>

34:22.228 --> 34:25.231
<i>to the nearest hospital
from where we were.</i>

34:25.440 --> 34:27.315
<i>He needed to undergo surgery,</i>

34:27.525 --> 34:30.652
<i>and that would have taken him
out of the trip entirely.</i>

34:30.862 --> 34:32.612
<i>So he refused.</i>

34:32.822 --> 34:36.576
<i>He decided to rejoin the trip
and just tough it out.</i>

34:51.841 --> 34:53.176
Oh, very big hole.

34:53.384 --> 34:56.721
Yeah.
Big hole.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.473
Big bomb.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.017
This whole trail,
this whole section,

35:01.225 --> 35:02.018
there's a lot of 'em.

35:03.644 --> 35:06.022
<i>The first bomb crater we saw,</i>

35:06.230 --> 35:08.775
<i>I didn't believe
that that's what it was.</i>

35:08.983 --> 35:11.277
<i>It was the first time of seeing</i>

35:11.486 --> 35:13.946
<i>really obvious physical scars</i>

35:14.155 --> 35:15.907
<i>still left in the land</i>

35:16.115 --> 35:18.076
<i>and people living amongst that,</i>

35:18.284 --> 35:19.786
<i>and living
basically right on top,</i>

35:19.994 --> 35:22.789
<i>right around
all these bomb craters.</i>

35:24.707 --> 35:26.751
<i>There was crater after crater,</i>

35:26.959 --> 35:30.630
<i>and I actually couldn't fathom
the scope of the devastation</i>

35:30.838 --> 35:32.799
<i>and how many there were.</i>

35:39.472 --> 35:41.140
<i>Everywhere you look,
there's another one,</i>

35:41.349 --> 35:42.975
<i>there's another one,
there's another one.</i>

35:43.184 --> 35:45.061
<i>And I was asking Huyen
about them, like...</i>

35:45.269 --> 35:46.938
<i>"Why is that hole still there?"</i>

35:47.146 --> 35:49.440
<i>You'd think that the ground
would have filled in,</i>

35:49.649 --> 35:51.818
<i>but I guess it doesn't,
because in the rainy season,</i>

35:52.026 --> 35:53.611
<i>they fill with water</i>

35:53.820 --> 35:56.697
<i>and become these little ponds
and sort of ecosystems.</i>

35:56.906 --> 35:59.742
<i>Along the
trail, there are so many bomb craters.</i>

35:59.951 --> 36:03.121
That really reflects
the harshness of the war.

36:04.914 --> 36:09.293
<i>It's upsetting to see them.</i>

36:09.502 --> 36:11.587
<i>I felt sorry
for the people who lived there.</i>

36:11.796 --> 36:16.175
I felt sorry for my father
and the other pilots

36:16.384 --> 36:21.139
and the internal conflict
that they must have experienced.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.767
We knew one thing for sure,
that it was very painful.

36:24.976 --> 36:28.980
And I think that war
is the most cruel thing.

36:30.857 --> 36:33.776
<i>And I still do not understand
what it was for.</i>

36:42.785 --> 36:45.705
<i>Phanop Valley, this
was the main choke point</i>

36:45.913 --> 36:47.582
<i>because it was where</i>

36:47.790 --> 36:49.667
<i>the greatest concentration
of trucks were,</i>

36:49.876 --> 36:55.548
<i>so it was hit by fighters,
B-52s, continuously for years.</i>

36:55.756 --> 36:56.549
<i>Continuously.</i>

37:04.307 --> 37:06.142
<i>There's a town
in the Phanop Valley</i>

37:06.350 --> 37:07.393
<i>near the border of Vietnam.</i>

37:08.895 --> 37:11.063
<i>I called it Bomb Town.</i>

37:11.272 --> 37:14.358
<i>And what we did there was...</i>

37:15.526 --> 37:18.404
Wow, I mean, I... Yeah.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.323
I couldn't describe it.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.492
One thing you want to notice
is how they're rounded off,

37:23.701 --> 37:26.579
and the jagged pieces
are missing up there.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.165
Because... From this ordnance.
It got hit? Yeah.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.875
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

37:39.217 --> 37:41.427
<i>"Dear Judy, Sharon and Becky,</i>

37:43.471 --> 37:46.390
<i>"some of the anti-aircraft
from the bad guys over here</i>

37:46.599 --> 37:49.227
<i>"really water your eyes.</i>

37:49.435 --> 37:53.189
<i>"They use tracers so you can
really see it coming.</i>

37:53.397 --> 37:56.567
<i>"Most of the time, we've only
been getting small arms fire,</i>

37:56.776 --> 37:59.862
<i>"but I can do without any of it.</i>

38:00.071 --> 38:02.531
<i>"You kind of lose inhibitions
about bombing these guys</i>

38:02.740 --> 38:06.035
<i>"when you know they're trying
to knock you out of the sky.</i>

38:06.244 --> 38:08.037
<i>"I have to brief shortly.</i>

38:08.246 --> 38:12.500
<i>"Give my love and lots of hugs
and kisses to Sharon and Becky.</i>

38:12.708 --> 38:15.670
<i>"I've got that 8-by-10 color
picture of them at my desk,</i>

38:15.878 --> 38:19.131
<i>"and it is a real comfort
to look at.</i>

38:19.340 --> 38:22.260
<i>Be good. Steve."</i>

38:38.359 --> 38:40.027
These circles with an X through it

38:40.236 --> 38:42.321
are areas where
they were storing supplies,

38:42.530 --> 38:44.407
so very likely
this was a storage place

38:44.615 --> 38:45.825
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.549
<i>I think
many children from U.S.A.,</i>

39:01.757 --> 39:05.720
<i>if they can see
what happened here,</i>

39:05.928 --> 39:09.765
I think they don't want
to come here, came here.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.568
Get ready.

39:20.776 --> 39:21.819
Here it goes.

39:37.752 --> 39:39.003
They turn down here.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.713
Wow, this looks like this road.

39:42.715 --> 39:44.925
People
here are very rich, I think.

39:45.134 --> 39:46.719
Big house.
Yeah.

39:46.927 --> 39:48.679
Yeah.

39:48.888 --> 39:50.765
If you dig through
this barrel here,

39:50.973 --> 39:53.267
you'll find all kinds
of interesting artifacts.

39:53.476 --> 39:54.769
Maybe some pickaxes.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.980
This looks like
springs from trucks.

39:58.189 --> 40:01.400
I don't know, but this is
igniter instructions in English.

40:01.609 --> 40:05.446
What? Yeah, okay. Yeah, this is
a parachute flare casing.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.531
Oh, cool. Look at that.

40:07.740 --> 40:10.409
That's amazing.

40:10.618 --> 40:13.913
I feel sort of weird
snooping around everyone's houses.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.499
Like, you would
never do this at home.

40:16.707 --> 40:20.669
<i>You can go into many
villages and still find plates,</i>

40:20.878 --> 40:22.421
<i>utensils for cooking.</i>

40:22.630 --> 40:25.091
<i>Almost every village
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail,</i>

40:25.299 --> 40:26.842
<i>you'll find
a planter that's built</i>

40:27.051 --> 40:28.719
<i>from a cluster bomb casing.</i>

40:28.928 --> 40:30.513
There's still
plenty of evidence around,

40:30.721 --> 40:31.889
and it will remain
for many years.

40:33.349 --> 40:35.935
Oh, a pagoda.

40:36.143 --> 40:39.355
This place is sweet, with
the flowers and everything.

40:39.563 --> 40:42.149
Check that out.
Look at that drum.

40:42.358 --> 40:43.818
Fly.

40:48.155 --> 40:49.824
Wow...

41:05.172 --> 41:09.260
Somebody
collect it and put it here.

41:11.554 --> 41:13.264
<i>When I was young,</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:16.183
<i>I remember that people
would hear my father's story</i>

41:16.392 --> 41:19.687
<i>and they would say to me,
"Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

41:19.895 --> 41:22.440
<i>It must have been so awful
to grow up without a father."</i>

41:22.648 --> 41:24.191
<i>And I didn't really
understand that,</i>

41:24.400 --> 41:26.652
<i>because I was 3
when he was shot down.</i>

41:26.861 --> 41:30.573
<i>I was so young that
it was nothing that I knew.</i>

41:30.781 --> 41:34.201
<i>And it's taken me until now</i>

41:34.410 --> 41:37.204
<i>to be ready
to dig a little deeper</i>

41:37.413 --> 41:39.206
<i>and want to know more.</i>

41:40.374 --> 41:41.834
Can we go?

41:45.212 --> 41:46.255
Yes, I know.

41:46.464 --> 41:47.798
I feel you.

41:50.009 --> 41:51.385
Let's go.

41:54.972 --> 41:56.348
Yes.

42:04.440 --> 42:07.193
In my dad's case,

42:07.401 --> 42:09.111
they did an excavation

42:09.320 --> 42:12.948
<i>many years
after he was shot down,</i>

42:13.157 --> 42:15.743
and they identified him
through teeth.

42:15.951 --> 42:20.873
<i>So I went in
and they opened up the bag,</i>

42:21.081 --> 42:22.750
<i>and brought out the two teeth,</i>

42:22.958 --> 42:25.920
and showed me what the teeth
that were on the table were,

42:26.128 --> 42:28.589
and what his x-rays looked like.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.050
<i>It was no doubt.
I knew it was him.</i>

42:32.718 --> 42:34.470
<i>And my eyes filled with tears</i>

42:34.678 --> 42:37.056
and I thought...

42:37.264 --> 42:39.308
"Wow, he's...
He's really home."

42:39.517 --> 42:42.686
Because you don't believe it
until you see it.

42:42.895 --> 42:47.191
<i>And I thought, "How different
would our lives have been</i>

42:47.399 --> 42:48.734
<i>"if we knew
right at the beginning</i>

42:48.943 --> 42:50.319
<i>or doesn't it matter?"</i>

42:50.528 --> 42:53.280
<i>But I do know
that not a day has gone by</i>

42:53.489 --> 42:54.782
<i>that I don't miss him.</i>

42:54.990 --> 42:57.159
Not a day goes by where

42:57.368 --> 43:00.120
I want to make sure
I'm making him proud.

43:08.337 --> 43:11.382
<i>Growing up, I didn't know
what happened to my father.</i>

43:11.590 --> 43:15.970
<i>I had reoccurring dreams
that maybe he was alive</i>

43:16.178 --> 43:19.056
<i>and he had another family
and was living over here.</i>

43:20.641 --> 43:22.184
<i>We would meet in a coffee shop,</i>

43:22.393 --> 43:25.563
<i>and I would tell him
all about my life.</i>

43:25.771 --> 43:27.773
<i>And when they found his remains,</i>

43:27.982 --> 43:30.818
<i>and I knew that he died
that day in the crash,</i>

43:31.026 --> 43:33.946
<i>I felt a strong desire
to come here</i>

43:34.154 --> 43:35.447
<i>and try to find out</i>

43:35.656 --> 43:38.784
<i>the circumstances
around his death.</i>

43:38.993 --> 43:41.662
Yeah.
Yeah.

43:41.870 --> 43:43.330
I don't understand.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.251
<i>To better communicate
with the locals,</i>

43:47.459 --> 43:49.545
<i>we enlisted Pahn's help.</i>

43:51.714 --> 43:53.716
<i>I am one of the coordinators</i>

43:53.924 --> 43:55.634
<i>who guide the track,</i>

43:55.843 --> 43:57.720
speak to local people,

43:57.928 --> 44:01.265
and translate between
her team and local people.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.019
<i>Each individual village,</i>

44:05.227 --> 44:06.812
<i>depending
on their ethnic background,</i>

44:07.021 --> 44:09.440
<i>has areas that are sacred
that have to be honored.</i>

44:09.648 --> 44:11.525
<i>So he would also check
quite thoroughly about that</i>

44:11.734 --> 44:12.818
<i>and inform us.</i>

44:18.699 --> 44:20.367
<i>Just as we were about to leave,</i>

44:20.576 --> 44:22.745
<i>PAHN told us a monk
had been watching us,</i>

44:22.953 --> 44:24.580
<i>and wanted to show us something.</i>

44:30.169 --> 44:34.381
Pass through here slowly
because of the bombee in the ground.

44:34.590 --> 44:37.718
There are some bombee
under the ground.

44:37.926 --> 44:39.219
Walk here, in his steps.

44:39.428 --> 44:40.971
Walk in the line.

44:41.180 --> 44:43.766
I didn't see
where he first stepped.

44:45.684 --> 44:46.935
Okay. Wow.

44:51.982 --> 44:53.317
What is it?

44:54.652 --> 44:55.903
A bomb.

44:56.111 --> 44:59.031
A part of bomb.
Avoid.

44:59.239 --> 45:01.492
PAHN
You just step on it, it explode.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.452
Be careful here.

45:09.958 --> 45:12.086
Be careful.

45:18.842 --> 45:19.760
Ah...

45:21.512 --> 45:23.097
Bombees.

45:23.305 --> 45:25.766
The plane drop it to ground,

45:25.974 --> 45:29.186
and then they do this.

45:29.395 --> 45:31.939
Also they have many, many too.

45:32.147 --> 45:33.440
The "bombees."

45:33.649 --> 45:35.567
He only found it
about a month ago.

45:35.776 --> 45:39.113
A month ago he found it?
He found, yeah.

45:39.321 --> 45:40.447
Like Vietnam.

45:40.656 --> 45:43.701
In Vietnam, we have many.

45:43.909 --> 45:46.286
Thank you for showing us.

45:46.495 --> 45:49.164
<i>There was an unexploded
ordnance right on the ground</i>

45:49.373 --> 45:51.500
<i>that the monk walks
every single day.</i>

45:51.709 --> 45:53.627
<i>I can't even imagine
what that's like.</i>

45:53.836 --> 45:55.921
<i>It was the first time in my life</i>

45:56.130 --> 45:58.382
<i>I have ever seen a bomblet,</i>

45:58.590 --> 46:02.219
<i>and I knew it could go off
at any time.</i>

46:02.428 --> 46:04.263
<i>People's lives
were still threatened,</i>

46:04.471 --> 46:06.974
<i>though war has passed
for 40 or 50 years.</i>

46:07.182 --> 46:09.977
I couldn't understand
Rebecca's emotions fully.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.062
She didn't express
her feelings to me,

46:12.271 --> 46:15.566
<i>but I did feel
that she was holding in a lot.</i>

46:25.784 --> 46:28.746
<i>From 1964 to 1973,</i>

46:28.954 --> 46:31.331
<i>the U.S. intensified
their bombing campaigns</i>

46:31.540 --> 46:34.960
<i>along the Ho Chi Minh Trail,
especially in Laos.</i>

46:39.381 --> 46:41.425
<i>Determined to stop
the continuous flow</i>

46:41.633 --> 46:43.927
<i>of troops, weapons
and supplies on the trail,</i>

46:44.136 --> 46:45.304
<i>the U.S. conducted more than</i>

46:45.512 --> 46:46.847
<i>half a million bombing missions</i>

46:47.055 --> 46:48.557
<i>over the course of the war,</i>

46:48.766 --> 46:50.768
<i>averaging out
to about one strike mission</i>

46:50.976 --> 46:52.519
<i>every eight minutes.</i>

46:54.313 --> 46:56.315
<i>Approximately eight million
tons of bombs</i>

46:56.523 --> 46:58.442
<i>were dropped over Southeast Asia</i>

46:58.650 --> 47:01.695
<i>with three million tons
dropped directly on Laos,</i>

47:01.904 --> 47:05.407
<i>making it the most heavily
bombed country on the planet.</i>

47:06.909 --> 47:08.452
<i>Nearly one-third of those bombs</i>

47:08.660 --> 47:10.287
<i>failed to detonate upon impact,</i>

47:10.496 --> 47:12.122
<i>leaving approximately 25 percent</i>

47:12.331 --> 47:13.540
<i>of the region littered</i>

47:13.749 --> 47:15.292
<i>with unexploded ordinances,</i>

47:15.501 --> 47:18.378
<i>also known as UXOs.</i>

47:18.587 --> 47:21.423
<i>Since the end
of the Vietnam War in 1975,</i>

47:21.632 --> 47:23.926
<i>it's estimated that
in Vietnam and Laos,</i>

47:24.134 --> 47:28.722
<i>more than 60,000 people have
been killed or injured by UXOs.</i>

47:31.058 --> 47:33.185
<i>Because of the bomb</i>

47:33.393 --> 47:36.271
<i>left from the war,
I lost my eye.</i>

47:36.480 --> 47:39.483
<i>I lost my arm.</i>

47:39.691 --> 47:44.071
<i>When we
clear our farms, that's scary.</i>

47:44.279 --> 47:45.739
I'm scared,
but if we don't do it,

47:45.948 --> 47:48.242
how can we feed ourselves?

47:48.450 --> 47:50.202
<i>Over the past 40-plus years,</i>

47:50.410 --> 47:53.372
<i>organized bomb removal teams
have been scouring the land</i>

47:53.580 --> 47:56.208
<i>carefully extracting
the bombs one at a time,</i>

47:56.416 --> 47:59.378
<i>and disposing of them
using controlled explosions.</i>

48:02.256 --> 48:03.966
<i>In addition to bomb removal,</i>

48:04.174 --> 48:08.053
<i>governments are working
to educate locals about UXOs.</i>

48:08.262 --> 48:10.806
<i>Especially at risk
are villagers who earn a living</i>

48:11.014 --> 48:12.891
<i>by recycling the scrap metal,</i>

48:13.100 --> 48:15.811
<i>and children who think
the bombs are balls or toys.</i>

48:16.019 --> 48:17.729
Maybe it's a bomb.

48:17.938 --> 48:19.106
Bring it out.

48:19.314 --> 48:20.816
Gently, gently.

48:22.776 --> 48:25.153
<i>At the current
pace of UXO removal,</i>

48:25.362 --> 48:26.822
<i>it'll be more than 100 years</i>

48:27.030 --> 48:28.365
<i>before all the bombs
in the region</i>

48:28.574 --> 48:29.825
<i>have been successfully cleared.</i>

48:58.353 --> 49:02.441
<i>In one of the villages,
we met an elderly lady</i>

49:02.649 --> 49:06.403
<i>who was alive during the war
and living there.</i>

49:06.612 --> 49:08.822
<i>Good afternoon, Ma'am.</i>

49:09.031 --> 49:11.742
<i>These girls are foreigners.</i>

49:11.950 --> 49:17.873
Would you mind telling us
where people lived in the war?

49:18.081 --> 49:20.417
Can you tell them?

49:23.170 --> 49:27.132
We lived
in the cave, the forest.

49:27.341 --> 49:28.759
We lived in the mountain.

49:28.967 --> 49:30.385
During the war,

49:30.594 --> 49:35.432
how long did you stay
in the cave?

49:35.641 --> 49:38.226
Very long.
How long, days or months?

49:38.435 --> 49:40.979
Five to six years.

49:42.648 --> 49:45.734
Also, she too is daughter.

49:45.943 --> 49:47.653
She was born in the cave.

49:47.861 --> 49:52.491
She was born there.
Her brother was born there.

49:52.699 --> 49:54.576
<i>And I asked this woman,</i>

49:54.785 --> 49:56.370
<i>"Well, why did you come back</i>

49:56.578 --> 49:58.413
<i>to this place
that was devastated?"</i>

49:58.622 --> 50:00.290
<i>I mean,
their village is now built</i>

50:00.499 --> 50:03.877
<i>around a whole maze
of bomb craters.</i>

50:04.086 --> 50:05.963
<i>And she just simply said,</i>

50:06.171 --> 50:09.007
<i>"well, this is my home.
Where else would I go?</i>

50:09.216 --> 50:11.927
<i>I came home
because I live here."</i>

50:12.135 --> 50:13.637
<i>That was really powerful for me,</i>

50:13.845 --> 50:15.722
<i>and especially, you know,</i>

50:15.931 --> 50:17.265
<i>I've lived out of my car,</i>

50:17.474 --> 50:19.142
<i>I've lived all over the place,</i>

50:19.351 --> 50:22.938
<i>and haven't had a sense of home
for a lot of my life.</i>

50:32.239 --> 50:36.118
<i>The caves were essential
for survival during the war.</i>

50:36.326 --> 50:39.788
<i>They were used as shelter
from the bombing,</i>

50:39.997 --> 50:42.582
<i>for storing ammunition and food,</i>

50:42.791 --> 50:44.126
<i>war room planning,</i>

50:44.334 --> 50:47.379
<i>and even shortcuts
through the jungle.</i>

50:47.587 --> 50:50.340
<i>Don found a cave
that we could pass through</i>

50:50.549 --> 50:53.301
<i>and meet up with the trail
on the other side,</i>

50:53.510 --> 50:55.637
<i>but since we are visitors
in this place,</i>

50:55.846 --> 50:58.348
<i>we have to abide
by the local customs</i>

50:58.557 --> 51:01.143
<i>to get permission
to go through the cave.</i>

51:07.357 --> 51:09.359
They drink the whole thing?

51:09.568 --> 51:11.361
Whiskey.
Whiskey.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.531
Okay.

51:14.740 --> 51:16.116
Heh. Okay.

51:18.827 --> 51:20.370
It's good.

51:20.579 --> 51:22.664
Thank you.

51:22.873 --> 51:24.958
Also for good luck.

51:25.167 --> 51:26.293
What do I do?

51:26.501 --> 51:28.128
I just touch it?
Yeah. No, no.

51:28.336 --> 51:29.546
No. I eat it?
Yeah.

51:29.755 --> 51:32.299
Oh, okay. Really small.

51:32.507 --> 51:34.593
Give me this small one.
Yeah. Okay.

51:34.801 --> 51:37.095
Also good luck.

51:37.304 --> 51:38.805
The big one... Heh...

51:40.640 --> 51:42.934
No, the small one
is good, thank you, heh.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.564
Yeah, I have something
to tie it down with.

51:47.773 --> 51:49.232
<i>Immediately after the ceremony,</i>

51:49.441 --> 51:50.859
<i>Huyen and I grabbed our bikes</i>

51:51.068 --> 51:52.402
<i>because we really wanted</i>

51:52.611 --> 51:55.155
<i>to get through the cave
before nightfall.</i>

51:55.363 --> 51:56.531
Yup.

51:58.283 --> 51:59.659
Okay.

51:59.868 --> 52:01.536
I'll get the paddles.

52:18.762 --> 52:21.348
<i>It was the biggest cave
I've ever seen. Absolutely.</i>

52:21.556 --> 52:24.893
<i>And there's tons of caves
in this part of the world,</i>

52:25.102 --> 52:26.561
<i>and it's a big part
of the history</i>

52:26.770 --> 52:28.271
<i>of where people hid out.</i>

52:28.480 --> 52:30.565
<i>But also the explorer in me
was, like,</i>

52:30.774 --> 52:33.735
<i>"Okay, what's gonna be in here?
This is really exciting."</i>

52:39.282 --> 52:40.742
It's slippery. Be careful.

52:44.037 --> 52:45.372
You okay?
Yeah.

52:45.580 --> 52:47.374
It's really slippery.
Hold on to the boat.

52:52.963 --> 52:55.799
We have to take probably
at least two or three trips

52:56.007 --> 52:58.426
to move all the equipment
one by one.

52:58.635 --> 53:01.555
<i>There was
a super-difficult portage</i>

53:01.763 --> 53:03.723
<i>of getting around rapids</i>

53:03.932 --> 53:07.018
<i>and boulder-hopping and moving
the bikes and the kayak.</i>

53:08.895 --> 53:11.439
<i>Two of us really struggled.</i>

53:11.648 --> 53:13.191
<i>I wasn't as strong,</i>

53:13.400 --> 53:18.405
<i>so Rebecca was always
by my side to support me.</i>

53:22.909 --> 53:27.247
If these bikes survive
this, I will be shocked.

53:27.455 --> 53:30.500
We're gonna be here
till fucking 2 in the morning.

53:31.668 --> 53:33.670
Wait, wait. The pedal.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.011
I'm pissed!

53:49.102 --> 53:51.021
<i>The trip to the cave,</i>

53:51.229 --> 53:53.273
<i>it was lengthy
and gobbled up too much time.</i>

53:53.481 --> 53:54.900
<i>It took too much time,</i>

53:55.108 --> 53:57.777
<i>while Rebecca
always wanted to forge ahead</i>

53:57.986 --> 53:59.946
<i>to get to her dad
as soon as possible.</i>

54:00.155 --> 54:02.699
<i>And I really felt for her.</i>

54:02.908 --> 54:05.744
<i>We had been in the
cave for almost nine hours.</i>

54:05.952 --> 54:09.206
<i>It was exhausting,
frustrating, and set us back.</i>

54:11.958 --> 54:14.419
<i>Huyen finally pointed out
the outline of a tree.</i>

54:14.628 --> 54:16.254
<i>That's where I was, like,</i>

54:16.463 --> 54:18.882
<i>"Oh, we made it out, we made
it out, we're outside."</i>

55:01.174 --> 55:08.640
<i>Rebecca and I
were born in very different cultures.</i>

55:08.848 --> 55:11.768
Have you been riding with these?
Carrying these the whole time?

55:11.977 --> 55:13.687
Yes. Yeah.

55:13.895 --> 55:16.439
However, very soon I found

55:16.648 --> 55:19.150
one thing in common between us.

55:20.944 --> 55:22.904
<i>She lost her father
when she was a child,</i>

55:23.113 --> 55:27.284
<i>and I lost my mom since I was 8.</i>

55:27.492 --> 55:31.663
<i>We both have a family,
we have feelings,</i>

55:31.871 --> 55:34.082
<i>have fathers and mothers
that we've lost.</i>

55:35.875 --> 55:37.419
<i>The first time she talked openly</i>

55:37.627 --> 55:39.296
<i>about how close
she was with her mother,</i>

55:39.504 --> 55:42.966
and I asked about her husband
who's also passed away.

55:43.174 --> 55:45.635
And that's
really recent as well.

55:45.844 --> 55:47.971
<i>This was her opportunity
to kind of share</i>

55:48.179 --> 55:50.390
<i>a little bit more of her story.</i>

55:50.598 --> 55:55.145
<i>My life with
two kids has various difficulties.</i>

55:55.353 --> 55:57.314
<i>However,
it's my kids who give me</i>

55:57.522 --> 56:01.109
<i>strength and motivation in life.</i>

56:01.318 --> 56:03.903
<i>After sitting down
and sharing with Huyen,</i>

56:04.112 --> 56:07.532
<i>I realize that her daughter
is growing up just like me.</i>

56:07.741 --> 56:10.952
<i>We both lost our fathers
at a very young age.</i>

56:11.161 --> 56:13.204
<i>It really gave me
a better understanding</i>

56:13.413 --> 56:15.081
<i>of what Huyen's going through,</i>

56:15.290 --> 56:18.293
<i>especially knowing how hard
it was for my mom</i>

56:18.501 --> 56:20.879
<i>to raise us as a single parent.</i>

56:24.466 --> 56:26.593
You are very strong.

56:26.801 --> 56:28.094
Thank you.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.138
So are you.
You're doing awesome.

56:30.347 --> 56:32.349
That was
a gnarly couple of days.

56:34.142 --> 56:35.894
It all looks the same.

56:36.102 --> 56:37.854
I don't have my GPS rolling.

56:39.814 --> 56:42.692
Wow, it's not a very good trail.

56:42.901 --> 56:45.445
Too much.

56:45.653 --> 56:49.407
<i>So at that time I felt
utterly tired, drained and forlorn.</i>

56:49.616 --> 56:51.785
<i>After two strenuous days,</i>

56:51.993 --> 56:55.455
<i>I was exhausted
and I felt like giving up.</i>

56:55.663 --> 56:57.332
More up. More hiking.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.501
I think it stays hard
for a little while.

56:59.709 --> 57:02.003
Yeah. And then we'll
see Jason and Greg,

57:02.212 --> 57:04.339
but then we have 70
kilometers on the bike

57:04.547 --> 57:07.050
to reach our goal
of the campsite.

57:07.258 --> 57:10.053
I'll try my best to follow you.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.805
I thought it
was gonna get easier,

57:12.013 --> 57:13.473
but it doesn't look like it.

57:28.696 --> 57:29.739
Hey.

57:29.948 --> 57:31.491
Hi.

57:31.699 --> 57:33.034
Hi.
Hello.

57:33.243 --> 57:35.495
You guys spent
the night in a cave.

57:35.703 --> 57:38.206
We went through,
spent the night on the beach,

57:38.415 --> 57:41.000
then started the hike over
this morning.

57:41.209 --> 57:42.043
Yeah.

57:42.252 --> 57:43.586
Lots of walking.

57:43.795 --> 57:45.547
Today was all coming over?

57:45.755 --> 57:49.175
All hike a bike, just totally
over those mountains, like...

57:49.384 --> 57:50.718
Huyen, how are you feeling?

57:50.927 --> 57:53.012
My shoulders, my arms, my legs.

57:53.221 --> 57:54.973
From your pack?

57:55.181 --> 57:59.644
Huyen's body is definitely
reaching for the reserves.

58:01.146 --> 58:03.106
<i>It sounds like a long time</i>

58:03.314 --> 58:04.983
<i>of being sweaty and wet.</i>

58:05.191 --> 58:07.777
Rebecca definitely came back
with some battle scars

58:07.986 --> 58:11.906
and some scratches, and seemed
to be a little slower.

58:12.115 --> 58:14.200
It's 3:30, okay?

58:14.409 --> 58:17.620
So no more than
20, 30 minutes here and we go.

58:17.829 --> 58:19.289
Is that okay with you?
Yes.

58:19.497 --> 58:20.623
Cool. Awesome.

58:23.668 --> 58:27.505
Party.
I like it.

58:32.218 --> 58:34.304
<i>As we were about
to get back on the trail,</i>

58:34.512 --> 58:38.308
<i>we heard a group of Lao
villagers laughing and singing</i>

58:38.516 --> 58:40.393
<i>and having a great party.</i>

58:40.602 --> 58:42.687
<i>And it was such a welcome sight,</i>

58:42.896 --> 58:44.981
<i>and it was exactly
what we needed</i>

58:45.148 --> 58:48.193
<i>to lift our spirits
before the long ride ahead.</i>

58:49.777 --> 58:51.446
We can do this, right?
Yeah.

59:15.136 --> 59:17.805
I kind of wanted to
call a little team meeting.

59:18.014 --> 59:21.559
Everyone's tired, sweaty,
getting heat rash,

59:21.768 --> 59:25.647
and working super-long days,
and I just felt like

59:25.855 --> 59:28.274
that I wanted to kind of
use the opportunity

59:28.483 --> 59:33.154
to remind you why I'm here
and to thank you for being here.

59:33.363 --> 59:35.907
<i>My dad was a musician.
I don't know if you know that.</i>

59:36.115 --> 59:38.785
<i>One of his favorite songs
is one that speaks to me</i>

59:38.993 --> 59:41.788
<i>and sort of defines
how I've lived</i>

59:41.996 --> 59:43.665
<i>my life
wandering around as well.</i>

59:43.873 --> 59:45.375
<i>This is my father's voice,</i>

59:45.583 --> 59:47.877
<i>and it's the only time
I've heard his voice,</i>

59:48.086 --> 59:50.797

What is this, Don? What is it?

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:46.055
That's a seat off
an anti-aircraft gun.

01:02:46.264 --> 01:02:48.641
Really?
That they found up in the hills.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.269
So they dragged all
this stuff back here?

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.565
What's he telling you, Don?

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.484
He's saying that this
came from the anti-aircraft gun

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:00.153
they found up in the hills.

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.196
Yeah.
They got the seat,

01:03:02.405 --> 01:03:05.158
but all the rest of the metal
got sold to Vietnam.

01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:06.534
Oh.

01:03:06.743 --> 01:03:08.119
<i>This place is a living history.</i>

01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:11.080
<i>And it takes on
a whole other life</i>

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:13.583
<i>when it's right there
in front of your face.</i>

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:16.377
It's a better use for it
here, now.

01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:20.882
Just to chill under this tree.

01:03:52.747 --> 01:03:54.248
<i>Throughout the war,</i>

01:03:54.457 --> 01:03:56.626
<i>the Ho Chi Minh Trail
remained a top priority</i>

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:59.754
<i>in the United States' battle
against North Vietnam.</i>

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.798
<i>By 1969,</i>

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:05.927
<i>the U.S. had 540,000 troops
on the ground in Vietnam,</i>

01:04:06.135 --> 01:04:08.095
<i>yet they remained unable to halt</i>

01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:11.182
<i>the flow of supplies
along the trail,</i>

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.644
<i>so the U.S. continued
its relentless carpet-bombing</i>

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.396
<i>and even began spraying
the jungle with Agent Orange,</i>

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:19.190
<i>stripping the leaves off trees</i>

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:21.150
<i>to better spot
the trail from the air.</i>

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:26.364
<i>While the war raged on,</i>

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:30.368
<i>both sides continued
to suffer heavy losses.</i>

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:34.288
<i>By 1972,
the death toll was staggering.</i>

01:04:34.497 --> 01:04:38.459
<i>Approximately 58,000 Americans
were killed,</i>

01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:42.922
<i>hundreds of thousands of
Laotians and Cambodians died,</i>

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:46.676
<i>while three million Vietnamese
perished.</i>

01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:51.639
<i>Meanwhile, in the United States,</i>

01:04:51.848 --> 01:04:55.351
<i>anti-war protests began
to erupt across the nation.</i>

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.728
<i>Responding to
an ever-increasing death toll,</i>

01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.981
<i>many Americans
grew disillusioned</i>

01:05:00.189 --> 01:05:03.150
<i>with their nation's
heavy involvement in the war.</i>

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:22.920
<i>Huyen and I are
very different people.</i>

01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:27.341
<i>She is very talkative,
very curious,</i>

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.553
<i>and I tend to be
more of a private person.</i>

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:33.431
<i>It's probably good
because she actually gets me</i>

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:35.474
<i>to verbalize some of the things</i>

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:37.310
<i>that are spinning around
in my head.</i>

01:05:37.518 --> 01:05:39.020
<i>Many people,</i>

01:05:39.228 --> 01:05:44.859
many children, American,
Vietnamese, and Laos died here.

01:05:45.067 --> 01:05:50.364
When I think about it,
and I feel unhappy,

01:05:50.573 --> 01:05:56.787
and very lucky now
we can have a peace life.

01:05:58.831 --> 01:06:01.584
Ever since we got to this area,

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:06.839
I'm a little afraid
to see the place where he died.

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:08.841
I don't know how I'll feel.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:10.718
Yes.

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:14.555
I knew the trip
would be unpredictable

01:06:14.764 --> 01:06:17.183
and I would learn things,

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:20.061
like you said,
that I didn't expect, but...

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:25.399
<i>I think I'm learning more
about myself than I expected.</i>

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:34.033
<i>Maybe the missing part
of myself is here.</i>

01:06:44.627 --> 01:06:47.880
<i>"Dear Judy, Sharon and Becky,</i>

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.176
<i>"I'm not looking forward

01:06:52.385 --> 01:06:54.720
<i>"I love the flying
and the airplane,</i>

01:06:54.929 --> 01:06:56.514
<i>"but I don't like the job.</i>

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.684

<i>"about this war or any other,</i>

<i>"it is hard to think

<i>"that I will be doing.</i>

01:07:06.816 --> 01:07:09.402
<i>"I try to rationalize and say
that it has to be done,</i>

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:13.948
<i>"but I can't see any reason why.</i>

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:16.325
<i>"If anything
should happen to me,</i>

01:07:16.534 --> 01:07:19.370
<i>"please don't let me die

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.956
<i>"That is very important to me.</i>

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:25.501
<i>"I'll close now.</i>

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.712
<i>"I've been rambling enough.</i>

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:32.842
<i>Be good. Steve."</i>

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:48.315
<i>The original schedule as planned</i>

01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:49.984
<i>was to visit the crash site</i>

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:53.112
<i>on the anniversary
of my father's death.</i>

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.782
<i>We had a huge ride
in front of us.</i>

01:07:56.991 --> 01:07:58.826
<i>We were late,
the clock is ticking,</i>

01:07:58.993 --> 01:08:02.413
<i>but we pushed on
and we finally got to Ta Oy,</i>

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:05.124
<i>a small village really close
to the crash site.</i>

01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:11.881
<i>Yeah, for locating
the actual crash site,</i>

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:13.591
<i>we had historical documents</i>

01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:16.176
from the Joint Pacific
Accounting Command,

01:08:16.385 --> 01:08:18.179
who'd actually
excavated the site

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.764
and had GPS coordinates.

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.599
<i>We could match them up
with modern-day maps,</i>

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:23.600
<i>go in and actually find
the crash site,</i>

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:26.145
<i>with the help
of the local villagers,</i>

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.773
<i>who had actually been there
at the time.</i>

01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:31.859
If you go to the crash site
or go to Ta Oy,

01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:35.321
we have to get permission
from Liban, the village chief.

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:37.281
The village chief.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.076
<i>It's his land where
the plane went down,</i>

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.870
<i>and so we have
to follow that protocol.</i>

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:45.081
<i>It's just the way that it works.</i>

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:47.666
It's not like
faxing over a document

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.210
and signing it and you're done.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.045
It's like, you sit
on the floor with them,

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.671
<i>and you drink
some mystery alcohol,</i>

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:57.718
and it's... You kind of be
in their environment.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:00.011
<i>Logistics and difficulties</i>

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.598
<i>in finding
and contacting the chief</i>

01:09:02.807 --> 01:09:05.643
<i>meant that we didn't get
to the crash site that day.</i>

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.272
<i>I was frustrated.</i>

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:12.774
<i>We were so close
to the crash site,</i>

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:15.236
<i>but now it was clear that</i>

01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:17.904
we were not gonna be there
on the anniversary.

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.294
<i>My name is Don RAKESTRAW.</i>

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.962
I was in the other aircraft

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.924
on the morning
of March 7th, 1972,

01:09:37.133 --> 01:09:40.636
in which I saw
Stephen's aircraft get hit.

01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:45.640
This is my statement
as to what exactly happened.

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.144
"On the 7th of March, 1 <i>9</i> 72

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:51.564
<i>"Gunfighter 60 and 61
departed Da Nang Air Base</i>

01:09:51.772 --> 01:09:54.358
<i>"to search for trucks
moving early in the morning</i>

01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:58.404
<i>"on the route structures
in southern Laos.</i>

01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:00.114
<i>"We sighted two trucks</i>

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:02.950
<i>"and called them out
to Stephen's aircraft,</i>

01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:06.036
<i>"which also
had the trucks in sight.</i>

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:08.914
<i>"He called he was rolling in
on the target.</i>

01:10:09.123 --> 01:10:12.793
<i>"A few seconds later, we notice
muzzle flashes on the ground</i>

01:10:13.002 --> 01:10:16.672
<i>"and tracers from a triple A
gun, going what appeared</i>

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:19.175
<i>"to be right across
Stephen's flight path.</i>

01:10:21.177 --> 01:10:24.555
<i>"I then saw a bomb explode,
and right after that</i>

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:29.059
<i>"I saw Stephen's aircraft
hitting the ground.</i>

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.603
"In my estimation,

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:33.439
"Stephen's aircraft
was hit by ground fire

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:35.316
"which disabled the crew,

01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:38.235
and they went in
with the aircraft."

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.463
<i>For one of the first
times, we actually halted.</i>

01:10:57.671 --> 01:11:02.092
<i>And for me, it was a time
to organize my thoughts.</i>

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.348
<i>This country just moves
at a different pace,</i>

01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:09.141
<i>different than America,
you know.</i>

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:12.394
<i>I was just letting that happen.</i>

01:11:12.603 --> 01:11:14.313
<i>Don was pouring over his maps</i>

01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:17.316
<i>and cross-checking
the GPS coordinates</i>

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:18.984
<i>with the military documents.</i>

01:11:19.193 --> 01:11:21.070
There's two different
points marked.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.988
One of the actual GPS
coordinates

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:25.366
that they quoted is right here,

01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:27.785
and apparently
the other excavation site

01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:31.163
would be down here.
They're separated by 500 meters.

01:11:31.372 --> 01:11:33.207
It's a large area and, well,

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:35.834
don't get
your expectations too high.

01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:40.256
<i>PAHN came back with the news</i>

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:44.009
<i>that finally the village chief
was able to meet with us.</i>

01:12:00.818 --> 01:12:02.444
This,

01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:04.488
the head of the village.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:05.739
Mr. Airh.

01:12:22.798 --> 01:12:25.592
PAHN So this is his culture.

01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:29.805
If guest come to visit,
have to have Lao whiskey.

01:12:30.014 --> 01:12:33.058
First for the spirit
of the house.

01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:35.853
Yeah?
For take care our team.

01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:43.235
How it taste?

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:44.820
Strong.

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:49.742
He heard from the
elder of the village.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.662
Talked to him about...

01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:58.167
plane crash in 1972.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:04.757
In 2003, he go to join the team
to looking for the plane crash.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:06.342
He was on the team that went?

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:09.303
Yeah, he also join the team
for looking for...

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:11.138
Wow.

01:13:11.347 --> 01:13:15.893
AIRH <i>When they
excavated, I joined them.</i>

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.895
<i>I worked as a laborer.</i>

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:21.815
When we found something hard,
the Americans would come get it.

01:13:22.024 --> 01:13:24.401
Then they told us whether
it was the bomb or plane debris.

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:27.946
It's incredible to meet somebody
who helped find my dad.

01:13:28.155 --> 01:13:32.534
It was really important
for me and my family, so...

01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:39.750
<i>Mr. Airh told us what happened.</i>

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:42.252
<i>They screened to search
for the remains</i>

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:45.589
<i>such as bones, teeth,
or things like nails.</i>

01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:47.549
<i>They found
and screened two teeth,</i>

01:13:47.758 --> 01:13:50.135
<i>and they brought them
back to the U.S.</i>

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:54.306
<i>Luckily,
they were Rebecca's father's.</i>

01:13:54.515 --> 01:13:56.600
There was another pilot,
but he wasn't lucky.

01:13:56.809 --> 01:13:58.102
He flew with Rebecca's father,

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:00.229
but his remains
were never found.

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:05.776
They shot the plane
from far away and followed.

01:14:08.737 --> 01:14:12.533
After the plane
dropped, two Vietnamese soldiers,

01:14:12.741 --> 01:14:15.953
one head of the village
at that time,

01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:22.292
his father go to check
and see the dead person,

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:26.797
and they put under the tree.

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:30.509
He'll show you
at the crash site.

01:14:32.678 --> 01:14:35.305
His father buried my father?

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:37.266
Yeah, his father.

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.144
Mmm.

01:14:44.273 --> 01:14:47.401
It's okay, it's okay.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.195
Mmm.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.867
And the tree is still there,
the exact tree?

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:57.369
It's still the same.

01:14:57.578 --> 01:15:00.164
Still... Still over there.

01:15:00.372 --> 01:15:03.292
He will show you the tree.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.335
Okay.
Yeah.

01:15:14.803 --> 01:15:17.055
<i>How I found him
and found this village,</i>

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:19.766
<i>there's no other explanation
than it was meant to be.</i>

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:22.811
There's no other way
to explain it.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.856
So, I mean, I sat there
in shock, and it's like,

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:28.066
"Okay, I'm ready.
Now we really have to go.

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:29.693
We have to go to this site."

01:15:29.902 --> 01:15:33.447
How blissful
and ecstatic she was.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:43.081
<i>A daughter who lost her father
since the age of three,</i>

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.959
<i>and in all those years
until she is 46,</i>

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:49.171
<i>she has always been longing
to return to her father</i>

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:50.422
<i>and reconnect with him.</i>

01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:23.372
He says... The
tree over there, you see?

01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:26.625
<i>He pointed around the corner,</i>

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.335
<i>and you know,
at the top of the tree,</i>

01:16:28.544 --> 01:16:30.879
and kind of gestured that

01:16:31.088 --> 01:16:33.298
that was the tree
that he was talking about.

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.512
<i>How far we've come to be here.</i>

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.099
<i>And how many years
I've waited for this.</i>

01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:45.561
<i>And now, this moment
was staring right at me.</i>

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:05.914
<i>It was
a very strange tree, very old.</i>

01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:10.586
<i>I could sense
Rebecca's intense emotion.</i>

01:17:10.794 --> 01:17:12.963
<i>And I thought she looked
at that tree</i>

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:14.464
<i>as if she was waiting for</i>

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:16.883
<i>her father
to emerge from the tree.</i>

01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:25.726
<i>"This journey down
the Ho Chi Minh Trail</i>

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:27.811
<i>"has brought me here to meet you</i>

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.397
<i>"and stand in the place
where you died,</i>

01:17:30.606 --> 01:17:33.525
<i>"where you died
for me and your country.</i>

01:17:33.734 --> 01:17:35.694
<i>"You've spoken to me
through your songs,</i>

01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:39.072
<i>"your letters and the way
you lived your life.</i>

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:40.949
<i>"You've given me
the gift of life,</i>

01:17:41.158 --> 01:17:42.743
<i>"and the tools to live mine</i>

01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:47.748
<i>"with compassion,
joy and curiosity.</i>

01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:49.833
<i>"I know now that this,</i>

01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:52.669
<i>"this is not an ending,
but a beginning,</i>

01:17:52.878 --> 01:17:55.255
<i>"the beginning
of our relationship.</i>

01:17:56.632 --> 01:17:58.467
<i>"I miss you, Dad...</i>

01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.180
"but now I know
you'll always be with me.

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:04.973
Love, Rebecca."

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:15.859
<i>I felt relieved.</i>

01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:17.319
I felt...

01:18:20.656 --> 01:18:23.241
I felt close to him
for the first time in my life.

01:18:26.203 --> 01:18:29.039
I felt like he was really there.

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.588
And so I read him...

01:18:36.797 --> 01:18:40.133
I read him my letter,
and spoke to him,

01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:44.096
and uttered the words "Dad"
for the first time in my life.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:52.562
And it felt good to say,
felt good to say, "Hi, Dad."

01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:13.375
<i>So I left my letter in there,</i>

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:17.337
<i>and I left his MIA bracelet
that my mom had given me,</i>

01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:21.425
because he's not missing
for me anymore.

01:19:21.633 --> 01:19:23.760
I finally found him.

01:19:31.143 --> 01:19:33.478
<i>I didn't see a strong athlete,</i>

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:38.483
<i>but a daughter
coming back to her father.</i>

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:40.819
Just like she was saying,
"Dad, are you seeing me?

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:42.112
It's me."

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.115
Come on in, you guys.

01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:47.492
AIRH <i>When I took
Rebecca to her father,</i>

01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:49.661
<i>where the plane crashed,</i>

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:56.376
I guess from her expressions,
she felt both sad and happy.

01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:06.178
And then he showed
Rebecca the slide path

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:08.305
that the plane had taken
as it tumbled down the hill

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:10.974
<i>to its eventual resting spot.</i>

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:14.936
Oh, yeah, I see.

01:20:16.563 --> 01:20:17.898
There's a huge trench,

01:20:18.106 --> 01:20:20.484
goes as far as I can see,

01:20:20.692 --> 01:20:22.819
just dug down
where the plane slid.

01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:24.821
Yeah.

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:26.948
Oh, it goes a long way.

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:29.951
That made it real,
and even more magical,

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.412
because, you know that...

01:20:32.621 --> 01:20:34.623
You know, that's the place.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.380
No way.

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:43.924
And look what he just found,

01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:45.717
he just found
a couple of things...

01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:47.302
Just...

01:20:47.511 --> 01:20:50.972
What?
Yeah, he just picked them up.

01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:53.600
I bet all up and down here
there's stuff.

01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:55.977
<i>The impact site
was up the hill a ways,</i>

01:20:56.186 --> 01:20:59.189
<i>and the plane had slid down
toward the tree,</i>

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:01.983
<i>and it had left
a pretty good scar</i>

01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:03.777
<i>on the land
that was still there.</i>

01:21:03.985 --> 01:21:05.862
Wow.

01:21:06.071 --> 01:21:08.198
Yeah, heh.

01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:12.619
Yeah.

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:36.101
AIRH <i>My feelings towards
the event that I met Rebecca,</i>

01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:38.144
<i>I felt sorry for her.</i>

01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:41.481
I would go out
and find my father too,

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:44.734
if it was my father.

01:21:44.943 --> 01:21:47.612
She came here
because she is a good daughter.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:22:02.627
Laos or other nationality,
we are all human.

01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:05.380
<i>We have feelings.</i>

01:22:05.589 --> 01:22:07.424
<i>I'm so happy
that we could help her.</i>

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:09.676
I'm glad we came here.

01:22:13.221 --> 01:22:15.056
Absolutely.

01:22:15.265 --> 01:22:17.183
As long as I am alive,

01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:20.979
I will tell my children
not to cut down that tree.

01:22:21.187 --> 01:22:22.814
I'm gonna go back to the tree.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:24.107
Okay.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:29.112
<i>Since Rebecca started</i>

01:22:29.321 --> 01:22:34.868
<i>the journey back
to where her father died,</i>

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.620
<i>she was very persistent</i>

01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:41.249
<i>and eager
to get there immediately.</i>

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:43.835
<i>Day after day, she became
more and more impatient.</i>

01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.587
<i>She yearned for it.</i>

01:22:47.297 --> 01:22:50.091
<i>And I believe
it was the biggest hope,</i>

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.929
<i>the cause for which
she did this trip.</i>

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.389
<i>It was to find the love</i>

01:22:56.598 --> 01:22:59.309
<i>that she had not been granted
since her childhood.</i>

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.489
<i>Visiting him and
visiting the site,</i>

01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:15.492
<i>it doesn't feel like
mourning of a death.</i>

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:20.080
<i>It feels like kind of a rebirth
of him, in a way.</i>

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.957
<i>I'm finding out who this man was</i>

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:25.669
<i>that I never asked
the questions about</i>

01:23:25.877 --> 01:23:27.671
<i>when I was younger.</i>

01:23:27.879 --> 01:23:30.882
<i>But now that
that floodgate is open,</i>

01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:33.301
<i>all that information,
all those songs,</i>

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:35.887
<i>those are things that,
as soon as I get home,</i>

01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:39.307
<i>I'm gonna be digging into
with a hunger.</i>

01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:23.244
Yay!
We have a welcoming party!

01:25:25.497 --> 01:25:28.500
<i>So much has happened
in just a couple weeks here,</i>

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.335
<i>and now the mood</i>

01:25:30.543 --> 01:25:32.879
<i>and the motivation
has certainly shifted.</i>

01:25:33.088 --> 01:25:34.547
<i>And Ho Chi Minh City</i>

01:25:34.756 --> 01:25:36.341
<i>is within
striking distance, really.</i>

01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:39.094
<i>Even though my body
is starting to break down,</i>

01:25:39.302 --> 01:25:43.473
<i>and I'm feeling the effects
of the trail, but we're close.</i>

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:46.309
This seems so long ago
right here, heh.

01:25:46.518 --> 01:25:48.186
Now we're down here,

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:50.105
and we're already looking
at the finish line.

01:25:54.484 --> 01:25:57.529
<i>For the rest of the ride
through Cambodia and Vietnam,</i>

01:25:57.737 --> 01:25:58.905
<i>it was like a blur.</i>

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:05.787
<i>A weight had been lifted,
and I felt free and happy.</i>

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:08.331
I didn't expect
to feel that way.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:12.710
<i>After she saw bomb craters,</i>

01:26:12.919 --> 01:26:16.089
<i>the local people's
hard and poor lives</i>

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:19.384
<i>along the Ho Chi Minh Trail,</i>

01:26:19.592 --> 01:26:26.266
<i>I realized that she became
more and more open-hearted.</i>

01:26:26.474 --> 01:26:29.060
It felt to me that
she had changed significantly.

01:26:30.436 --> 01:26:31.563
<i>All along the trail,</i>

01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:33.690
<i>we talked about the war</i>

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:35.358
<i>and there wasn't ever
a discussion</i>

01:26:35.567 --> 01:26:39.821
<i>of blame or a political agenda</i>

01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:41.156
<i>or anything.</i>

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:42.824
<i>We both shared
the same sentiment</i>

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:44.576
<i>that it was unfortunate</i>

01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:47.787
<i>that so many people died
for something</i>

01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:49.622
<i>that not everybody understood,</i>

01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:52.500
<i>and I still don't
totally understand.</i>

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:56.504
<i>After a very
long journey on Ho Chi Minh Trail,</i>

01:26:56.713 --> 01:26:59.883
<i>seeing the harshness of the war
with my two eyes,</i>

01:27:00.091 --> 01:27:03.178
<i>my opinion about war
became clearer.</i>

01:27:03.386 --> 01:27:06.639
I understand the biggest pain
of humanity is war.

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:10.185
<i>Ultimately, I go back again</i>

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:12.061
<i>to the letters that my dad wrote</i>

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:15.607
<i>about war, explaining
how difficult it was</i>

01:27:15.815 --> 01:27:17.275
<i>to drop bombs on people,</i>

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:21.112
and how he didn't necessarily
understand why.

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:50.141
<i>After riding every
single day for nearly a month</i>

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:52.227
<i>and covering
more than 1200 miles,</i>

01:27:52.435 --> 01:27:54.812
<i>we were so relieved
to reach the finish.</i>

01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.443
<i>You could really tell that
Huyen was excited to be home.</i>

01:28:00.652 --> 01:28:02.946
<i>I felt cheerful and happy.</i>

01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:06.658
<i>Through the last day
of the journey,</i>

01:28:06.866 --> 01:28:10.161
I could never have imagined
that I could be so strong.

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.131
<i>We rolled into the city center,</i>

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.634
<i>and there was a small patch
of green grass,</i>

01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:27.720
<i>amongst all the cement
and the tall buildings,</i>

01:28:27.929 --> 01:28:31.140
<i>and it was the grounds
of the Independence Palace.</i>

01:28:31.349 --> 01:28:33.268
<i>This is the place where</i>

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:37.397
<i>two years after
the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam,</i>

01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:39.440
<i>the North overtook the South,</i>

01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:42.485
<i>ending the war
and joining the country</i>

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:45.321
<i>under one communist government.</i>

01:28:49.909 --> 01:28:52.245
<i>The whole crew
was there to greet us...</i>

01:28:52.453 --> 01:28:54.038
<i>Greg, Jason, Don,</i>

01:28:54.247 --> 01:28:57.208
<i>Huyen's family
and even my sister, Sharon.</i>

01:29:00.128 --> 01:29:01.379
Ah!

01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:03.548
<i>Huyen's kids ran up to her.</i>

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:06.134
<i>They really couldn't
contain their excitement.</i>

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:07.927
<i>They haven't seen
their mom in weeks.</i>

01:29:13.975 --> 01:29:17.520
<i>This trip opened my eyes
to really hold on tighter</i>

01:29:17.729 --> 01:29:20.523
<i>to the people
that are still here with me,</i>

01:29:20.732 --> 01:29:24.277
before it's too late,
before they're gone too.

01:29:24.485 --> 01:29:27.822
I'm so glad
you're here, heh, heh.

01:29:29.824 --> 01:29:31.617
I'm so glad you're here.

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:35.496
Good job.

01:29:35.705 --> 01:29:37.790
We did it, thank you.

01:29:37.999 --> 01:29:39.709
<i>The physical
objective was to ride</i>

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:41.586
<i>the whole thing,
and she did that.</i>

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:43.921
I think, emotionally,
it's probably been

01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:47.216
more rewarding
than she had hoped for.

01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:51.220
<i>I think I'm
lucky to see such a woman in my life.</i>

01:29:51.429 --> 01:29:54.557
<i>Not knowing
when we would meet again,</i>

01:29:54.766 --> 01:29:58.102
<i>I feel so sad, that I had
to say goodbye to a sister,</i>

01:29:58.311 --> 01:29:59.645
<i>a friend
who had shared difficulties</i>

01:29:59.854 --> 01:30:00.938
<i>side by side with me.</i>

01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:03.316
Mr. Don,
thank you for everything.

01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:05.777
Oh, what a great trip.

01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:08.863
<i>On my motorcycle, I can't say
I've ever done what they did.</i>

01:30:09.072 --> 01:30:10.573
<i>Tremendous experience for me.</i>

01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:15.286
Probably one of the best things
I've ever done in my life.

01:30:15.495 --> 01:30:19.957
I realized the war
was over and the war is still there.

01:30:21.167 --> 01:30:25.671
<i>When Rebecca found her father,</i>

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:29.509
<i>it was a source
of enormous happiness to her.</i>

01:30:29.717 --> 01:30:31.928
It was the feeling, I think.

01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:35.640
That is
the healing pains of war.

01:30:35.848 --> 01:30:37.517
Thanks for taking care
of my sister.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.021
We need to heal
those wartime pains.

01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:45.358
You did such a good job.

01:30:45.566 --> 01:30:48.945
And thank you for teaching me
how to slow down a little bit.

01:30:54.534 --> 01:30:56.953
They call the Ho Chi Minh Trail
the Blood Road

01:30:57.161 --> 01:30:59.539
because so many people
lost their lives here.

01:31:00.832 --> 01:31:02.417
<i>And while it's impossible</i>

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:04.043
<i>to completely erase the scars</i>

01:31:04.252 --> 01:31:06.170
<i>left from the war,</i>

01:31:06.379 --> 01:31:09.924
<i>we can honor the memory
of those who died here</i>

01:31:10.133 --> 01:31:12.385
<i>by learning from their sacrifice</i>

01:31:12.593 --> 01:31:14.554
<i>and choosing to forgive.</i>

01:31:21.352 --> 01:31:23.479
<i>If we can't learn to forgive,</i>

01:31:23.688 --> 01:31:26.732
<i>we'll just end up
making the same mistakes.</i>

01:31:37.076 --> 01:31:38.703
Over the past century,

01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:42.832
our two nations have known
cooperation and then conflict,

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.336
painful separation,
and a long reconciliation.

01:31:47.545 --> 01:31:50.756
<i>If you consider
where we have been,</i>

01:31:50.965 --> 01:31:53.217
<i>and where we are now,
the transformation</i>

01:31:53.426 --> 01:31:55.219
<i>in the relations between
our two countries</i>

01:31:55.428 --> 01:31:56.637
<i>is remarkable.</i>

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:58.115
<i>This is another
one you can sing along to.</i>

01:32:58.324 --> 01:32:59.909
<i>Everyone we sang for</i>

01:33:00.117 --> 01:33:02.703
<i>has seemed to like it
a little bit at least. Ahem.</i>

01:33:12.046 --> 01:33:13.756
