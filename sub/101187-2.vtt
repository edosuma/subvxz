00:05.422 --> 00:07.549
- Welcome to Ron Wilcox's
Action Star School.

00:07.633 --> 00:10.552
I'm Ron Wilcox,
and that was your first lesson.

00:10.636 --> 00:11.970
- Getting hit in the head with a bat?

00:12.054 --> 00:15.057
- Oh, you are naive. That was a prop bat.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.059
It was made of plastic.
- Wasn't goddamn plastic.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.393
I've been hit with a bat before.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.103
I know what a metal bat fucking feel like.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.356
- All right, hey.
Mr. Van De Velde told me to tell him

00:22.439 --> 00:25.817
if you complain about anything
being too difficult.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.529
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not complaining.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.322
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not complaining about nothing.
I loved that.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.782
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought it was great,

00:31.865 --> 00:35.244
to be honest with you. Gave me a rush.
- Good. Let's take the tour.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.453
- Yeah.
- Come on.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.039
This place used to be a slaughterhouse

00:39.122 --> 00:42.125
up until the '70s,
and then, as legend has it,

00:42.209 --> 00:44.586
the animals revolted
against their tormentors

00:44.670 --> 00:46.171
and they slaughtered the humans.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.799
- Oh, my God.
- And my pal Charles Norris--

00:48.882 --> 00:51.134
you know him as Chuck--
well, he needed a place to train.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.096
- Mm-hmm.
- I bought it, I mentored him.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.224
And that's why he's the badass
that he is today.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.852
Yeah.

00:59.935 --> 01:04.314
He nearly died within these walls.

01:04.398 --> 01:08.235
And that's how Ron Wilcox's
Action Star School got born.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.612
- Ron Wilcox's ASS for short.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.823
- What the fuck did you just say to me?

01:17.953 --> 01:20.205
- Did Matt get... Matt Damon go here?

01:20.289 --> 01:22.124
Oh, Matty boy!

01:22.207 --> 01:23.750
Fuck yeah!

01:23.834 --> 01:25.752
Matt Damon. Before he came to me,

01:25.836 --> 01:27.796
he was a no-name actor from New England.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.674
He was nothing.
He was 100 pounds soaking wet.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.635
- Uh, you sure we're talking
about the same Matt Damon?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.345
- Hell yeah. Matt Damon.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.723
- Huh. Okay.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.141
Yeah. If you say...
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.643
Rule number one:
no phones till you graduate.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.188
- Okay, I-I run an empire,
so unfortunately, I need my...

01:44.271 --> 01:45.731
- Okay, fine. You know what I'll do?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.733
I'll just call Mr. Van De Velde,
and I'll tell him, "Oh,

01:47.816 --> 01:49.776
"the phone policy wasn't working for him.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.778
It-it wasn't to his liking."

01:51.862 --> 01:53.739
- I never s...
- I know what you're gonna do with this.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.782
You're gonna make calls to Hollywood,
you're gonna say,

01:55.866 --> 01:58.285
"Hello, Hollywood,
Ron's school is too tough for me.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.703
I need more drugs."

01:59.786 --> 02:01.413
- No.
- Yeah. You're gonna say,

02:01.496 --> 02:04.583
"Oh, I'm Kevin Hart.
I need more caviar and champagne."

02:04.666 --> 02:06.460
- I just want to talk to my employees.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.962
- That's fine, but I'm still keeping it.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.090
- Okay.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.224
- Okay.
Until you graduate, you are forbidden

02:20.307 --> 02:22.142
from visiting the outside world.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.602
You'll stay here.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.395
- Say what?
- You got your bed,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.648
you got your toilet, you got your sink.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.234
All the modern amenities.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.701
- Okay. It's supposed to toughen me up.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.538
Okay, I get it.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.624
Yeah. I'm good with that.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.042
Yeah.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.836
Might be a little too good with it.

02:48.919 --> 02:52.631
- And rule number two:
no fucking on the premises.

02:52.714 --> 02:57.010
No anal, no blowjobs, no nothing.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.471
- Who else is here?

03:01.932 --> 03:04.518
- Just me.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.064
- So those-those two Colombian guys
that hit me

03:09.147 --> 03:11.733
in the head with the prop bat,
they were actors, right?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.151
- Yeah. Exactly.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.196
Okay, rule number three:

03:16.280 --> 03:19.032
when you're under this roof,
your name is no longer Kevin.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.242
It's Agent Hart.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.743
And you'll refer to me

03:21.827 --> 03:25.455
as Ron Wilcox or Ron
or Wilcox or Coach Ron.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.166
- I like Coach Ron.
- And I refer to you as?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.752
- Agent Hart. Right? See, I'm on it.
- Right. Yes.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.547
- Now I assume you got me
in this FBI jacket and stuff

03:33.630 --> 03:35.883
for a reason, so what is it?
- Hey.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.885
Uh, would you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.470
- Uh, Kevin,
would you grab that chair for me?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.181
- Yeah, you need this one?

03:42.264 --> 03:43.849
- No, goddamn it!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.101
I said respond only to "Agent Hart."

03:46.185 --> 03:48.187
- Fuck.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.024
You just said that. I fucked up.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.026
I'm sorry. That's not gonna happen again.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.235
Why don't you just call me Kevin?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.279
- Okay, in your life, have you ever heard

03:57.362 --> 04:00.699
an action star leading man
ever called "Kevin"?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.244
- I mean, Kevin James in Mall Cop.
-No, no.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.371
- Kevin is the name of a punk bitch.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.374
Ethan Hunt. That is an action star name.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.045
Tom Cruise-- who's my alumni--
for nine years of his life,

04:13.128 --> 04:15.464
he only responded to "Ethan Hunt."

04:15.547 --> 04:17.090
Whether he was on camera

04:17.174 --> 04:18.884
or off camera, whether he was...
- Wow.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.345
- ...in the shower or on the toilet,
whether he was fucking

04:21.428 --> 04:22.596
or not fucking.
- All right, okay.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.432
I fuck-- I understand, Coach Ron.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.476
- Do you? Do you really?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.186
I hope so.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.314
For your sake,
'cause your life depends on it.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.151
Okay, next lesson.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.779
Every leading man needs to know how to run

04:38.862 --> 04:40.822
into a burning building
and save a stranger.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.032
- Mm.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.205
Wow.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.124
Holy shit, how'd you do that?
- And the stranger

04:51.208 --> 04:55.128
that we are going to save today
is our own Action Star dummy

04:55.212 --> 04:57.005
Lil Kevin.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.925
- That supposed to be me?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.927
- I don't see the resemblance.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.303
- Are you fucking kidding...
- No, w--

05:03.387 --> 05:05.973
We-we've had this dummy for years, buddy.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.641
- Oh, hell no!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
- Bitch, that's my line.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.811
I've said that line in, like, 12 movies.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.855
- Agent Hart, are you a narcissist?

05:12.938 --> 05:15.482
- No.
- Do you think the whole world
is all about you?

05:15.566 --> 05:16.692
- That's not, I'm not...
- No, no.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.027
You look at you and then you look at him.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.195
- That's why I...
- Look at you and look at him.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.155
Do you see any resemblance?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.157
- Kinda sorta, man.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.034
O-Okay. All right, okay.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.661
Maybe I'm crazy.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.663
- Help! Help me!

05:29.746 --> 05:32.082
Oh, hell no! Help!

05:32.165 --> 05:34.042
Help me! Oh, hell no!

05:34.126 --> 05:36.962
- Now, safety during stunts
is of the utmost importance.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.424
- Yeah, but I mean,
that's why you got stuntmen, right?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.050
- Watch it.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.719
- No, for the other guys. Not for me.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.888
The-the lightweights. I don't...

05:45.971 --> 05:48.473
- Okay. Your jacket is flame-retardant,

05:48.557 --> 05:50.934
which means that if you catch on fire,

05:51.018 --> 05:53.228
don't panic,
I will come in and put you out.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.231
- Okay. Y-You're gonna...

05:56.315 --> 05:58.192
Ok-- I feel, I feel good,
I feel good about that.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.819
- When you're ready,
I want you to storm the house,

06:00.903 --> 06:03.405
find the victim and bring him to safety.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.950
What is that?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.328
What are you doing? I-I don't...

06:09.411 --> 06:10.370
I don't...

06:10.454 --> 06:12.456
- Psyching myself up.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.464
It's hot.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.257
Hot.

06:33.435 --> 06:36.855
It's fucking hot!
Where the fuck are you at?

06:36.939 --> 06:41.276
Oh, God. Oh, fuck, I can't see shit.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.694
Lil Kev?

06:42.778 --> 06:44.238
- Excuse me?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.366
Are you Ron Wilcox?
- Well, hello.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.201
How are you?
- Jordan King.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.203
- We've been waiting for you.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.621
- Help! Help me!
- I got you, buddy.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.456
I got you, Little Kev!
- Oh, hell no!

06:54.540 --> 06:56.875
- I'm about to save your little
beautiful black ass.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.837
- Help! Help me!

06:59.920 --> 07:01.338
Oh, hell no!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.257
- What the fuck?
- Help! Help me!

07:03.340 --> 07:06.301
- Who's this? What the...?
- Oh, hell no!

07:06.385 --> 07:08.929
- Oh!
- Help! Help me!

07:10.138 --> 07:11.723
Oh, hell no!
- It's fucking hot!

07:11.807 --> 07:13.767
- Help! Help me!
- Get your ass up.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.853
- Yeah, um, I'm just so nervous.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.689
I've never been in an action movie before.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.232
I just want bring my A game here.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.109
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- 90% is mental, okay?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.569
- It's hot! It's hot!
- You are gonna be fantastic.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.822
- Coach Ron!
- I just know it.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.657
- Oh, shit, is he okay?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.536
- Oh, Christ, you leave this guy
alone for five seconds. Geez.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.454
- Put me out!
Put me out, put me out, put me out!
