WEBVTT

00:06.037 --> 00:07.573
Hey, Buzzby, how are you today?

00:07.574 --> 00:09.068
Not so great, Bumbleton.

00:09.069 --> 00:10.604
I have a ton of pollen to collect,

00:10.605 --> 00:12.060
but I'm really tired.

00:12.061 --> 00:14.620
Flying a little low?
Maybe you should get high.

00:14.621 --> 00:17.308
- Who's this?
- This is Drugs.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.108
- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.

00:19.109 --> 00:21.837
Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzzz.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.669
Don't call me honey, honey.

00:23.670 --> 00:24.727
Pierce!

00:25.156 --> 00:26.244
Drugs doesn't say that.

00:26.245 --> 00:28.484
I don't say anything,
by the way.

00:28.485 --> 00:30.985
I mean, I thought this show
was about drug awareness.

00:30.986 --> 00:33.431
Who's gonna be aware of a
character that has no lines?

00:33.555 --> 00:36.633
And also I noticed on page 15
I get flushed down the toilet.

00:36.634 --> 00:38.309
Consider yourself lucky.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.682
Annie, question.
Is Pierce marijuana?

00:40.683 --> 00:42.408
And does marijuana help
people work faster?

00:42.409 --> 00:43.805
I thought it made them just
custom-paint their vans

00:43.806 --> 00:44.646
and solve mysteries.

00:44.647 --> 00:47.102
Also, are you sure that
my costume is on backwards?

00:47.103 --> 00:49.221
Somehow I felt more
confident before.

00:49.222 --> 00:51.301
I have a question.
I don't think my character

00:51.302 --> 00:52.630
would say "tripping balls."

00:52.631 --> 00:53.472
That's not a question.

00:53.473 --> 00:54.440
I don't think my character

00:54.441 --> 00:56.439
would say tripping balls, okay?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.986
Guys, let's remember
why we're doing this.

00:58.987 --> 01:01.294
If our work helps even one
kid make better choices,

01:01.295 --> 01:03.098
then it will all be worth it.

01:03.127 --> 01:05.408
I wish I had seen a show
like this when I was younger.

01:05.409 --> 01:07.188
It might have helped
me avoid my mistakes.

01:07.189 --> 01:08.990
Well, we're happy to
do this for you, Annie,

01:08.991 --> 01:11.428
but I have to say, my school
had plenty of shows like this,

01:11.429 --> 01:14.047
and I think sitting through
them drove me to drugs.

01:14.048 --> 01:14.954
You don't count, Britta.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.523
You don't respond to
anything appropriately.

01:16.524 --> 01:17.927
Thank you!

01:18.523 --> 01:20.344
Dean-dong!

01:21.491 --> 01:22.853
I'm just checking in to see

01:22.854 --> 01:25.472
how the Greendale antidrug
players are doing.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.160
Now, I talked to the
guidance counselor

01:27.161 --> 01:28.183
at the San Ramone middle school,

01:28.184 --> 01:30.340
and there's gonna be at least 50

01:30.341 --> 01:32.569
little at-risk rug rats
coming here tomorrow

01:32.570 --> 01:33.706
for your big world premiere.

01:33.707 --> 01:35.459
That is terrific.

01:35.460 --> 01:36.683
So with any luck,
we can get rid of

01:36.684 --> 01:39.351
all those Charleston Chews
in the vending machines.

01:39.953 --> 01:43.212
Um, dean Pelton,
were you hoping to participate

01:43.213 --> 01:45.499
- in the show? 
- Oh, I would love to, Annie.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.833
But as you can see from my outfit,

01:46.834 --> 01:50.523
I already have plans,
so off to the airport Ramada!

01:52.679 --> 01:54.762
How come he gets
a front stinger?

01:56.374 --> 01:59.517
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree

01:59.518 --> 02:02.720
♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam

02:02.721 --> 02:06.210
♪ somebody said we could be here

02:06.211 --> 02:10.132
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

02:10.133 --> 02:14.632
♪ I can't count the
reasons I should stay

02:15.101 --> 02:19.384
♪ one by one they all just fade away

02:24.030 --> 02:25.777
Do you think bees
eat their own honey?

02:25.860 --> 02:27.392
I'm sure they've
at least tasted it.

02:27.393 --> 02:30.156
- This guy keeps texting me.
- You don't like him?

02:30.157 --> 02:32.221
I don't like flirting in text.

02:32.226 --> 02:34.679
That's like saying you
don't work by electric light.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.358
If you want to have
an active sex life,

02:36.359 --> 02:37.170
part of it is texting.

02:37.171 --> 02:39.404
Hmm. I don't remember
asking your opinion.

02:39.405 --> 02:40.613
Can't talk now.

02:40.614 --> 02:44.370
Shirley, since I might be the
father of your unborn child,

02:44.423 --> 02:46.275
I made you a mix tape.

02:46.352 --> 02:48.092
I hope you like Johnny Gill.

02:48.318 --> 02:51.165
And since you probably don't
have a cassette player,

02:51.215 --> 02:53.983
here's a list of used
ones on Craigslist.

02:53.984 --> 02:55.613
Britta, are you walking
out of this room?

02:55.614 --> 02:57.292
Uh... yeah.

02:59.171 --> 03:00.786
Hey... you know that you're gonna

03:00.787 --> 03:02.105
have to acknowledge
him eventually.

03:02.106 --> 03:03.176
I don't know who
you're talking about.

03:03.177 --> 03:05.854
- Chang. - I know who you're talking
about... He doesn't exist!

03:08.695 --> 03:10.050
- Um, Annie?
- Ooh!

03:10.245 --> 03:11.897
- I'm sorry. A word?
- Mm-hmm!

03:11.913 --> 03:12.545
I don't know if you know this,

03:12.546 --> 03:16.139
but I did TV commercials
for Hawthorne Wipes...

03:16.140 --> 03:17.908
family business... in the fifties.

03:17.909 --> 03:18.756
Oh!

03:18.757 --> 03:21.964
I was kind of the Gerber
Baby of moist towelettes.

03:22.281 --> 03:23.657
- That's great, Pierce.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:23.781 --> 03:25.525
Oh, I've done a lot of acting.

03:25.526 --> 03:26.812
- Workshops. 
- Mm!

03:26.813 --> 03:29.824
I do physical comedy.
Funny dances.

03:30.197 --> 03:32.252
- Foreign accents. 
- Accents?

03:32.253 --> 03:33.645
Name any country.

03:33.830 --> 03:34.889
Russia.

03:35.150 --> 03:35.750
Point being,

03:35.751 --> 03:37.492
there are many tools I
can bring to the table

03:37.493 --> 03:39.560
that I think the
script may be wasting.

03:39.561 --> 03:40.604
Pierce, you know what I think

03:40.605 --> 03:42.520
is really great about this show?

03:42.869 --> 03:45.898
The only real star
of it is the message.

03:46.109 --> 03:48.191
Right. Uh... is the
message Jeff Winger?

03:48.192 --> 03:50.326
Because he's on every
page of this thing.

03:50.327 --> 03:51.986
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Uh...

03:51.991 --> 03:52.962
You bet.

03:56.847 --> 03:57.854
Oh, Britta left her phone.

03:57.855 --> 03:59.719
- She's getting a text message.
- Let me see.

04:00.467 --> 04:02.487
- Oh. It's from Marcus.
- Mm.

04:02.488 --> 04:04.291
"I'll be at the
show tomorrow night.

04:04.292 --> 04:06.061
"Can't wait to see you.

04:06.210 --> 04:09.302
Are you really wearing
a cat costume?"

04:09.410 --> 04:10.670
- Mm.
- Well, Marcus...

04:10.756 --> 04:12.955
You are in luck.

04:12.956 --> 04:13.681
What are you doing?

04:13.682 --> 04:16.892
Dragging Britta kicking
and screaming into 1997.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.171
- What did you say?
- "There's not much

04:18.172 --> 04:19.363
"to the cat costume,

04:19.363 --> 04:22.233
but can't wait to show
you what's underneath."

04:24.256 --> 04:25.643
How could you think
that was a good idea?

04:25.644 --> 04:26.900
- I got a better question.
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.901 --> 04:28.792
How could it not
be a great idea?

04:30.000 --> 04:36.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:11.349 --> 05:12.328
What...

05:14.604 --> 05:17.158
Pierce... what are you doing here?

05:17.159 --> 05:18.476
Never mind that.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.412
There's a rapist in the hallway.

05:20.413 --> 05:21.477
That's my landlord.

05:21.478 --> 05:23.688
And if he wanted to rape you,
you'd be raped.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.022
Did you follow me?

05:25.023 --> 05:27.332
Let me answer your
question with two of my own.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.345
What are you doing in an
apartment above Dildopolis?

05:30.516 --> 05:32.720
And when did they open
a second location?

05:32.725 --> 05:34.100
This is where I live, Pierce.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.807
It just happens to be
above a marital aid store.

05:36.808 --> 05:39.867
I don't get it.
Aren't everyone's parents rich?

05:39.919 --> 05:41.657
Well, I'm not
speaking to my parents.

05:41.658 --> 05:43.063
After my nervous breakdown,

05:43.064 --> 05:44.671
my mom wanted to put
the problem behind us,

05:44.672 --> 05:46.971
and I wanted to deal with it,
so I went to rehab,

05:46.972 --> 05:48.449
and she cut me off.

05:48.450 --> 05:49.474
What are you living on?

05:49.475 --> 05:51.819
I saved. Every penny
from babysitting,

05:51.820 --> 05:53.161
every birthday check,

05:53.162 --> 05:55.615
every dollar from the Period
Fairy when I was a kid.

05:55.699 --> 05:57.555
I guess I thought it
would last longer.

05:57.556 --> 05:59.561
Excuse me.
What's a Period Fairy?

05:59.956 --> 06:01.548
The fairy that
gives you a dollar

06:01.549 --> 06:03.218
every time you get your period.

06:03.428 --> 06:04.299
Does she still come?

06:04.300 --> 06:05.697
- Pierce!
- You know,

06:05.698 --> 06:08.143
you and I are very
much alike, Annie.

06:08.338 --> 06:10.675
We're both realists.
We're both cute.

06:11.019 --> 06:14.621
And we'd both rather die than
let someone else control us.

06:14.889 --> 06:16.896
I see the point of this place now.

06:17.913 --> 06:19.720
This crap hole is a monument

06:19.721 --> 06:21.253
to self-reliance.

06:22.624 --> 06:23.763
I found the drapes
in a dumpster.

06:23.764 --> 06:24.976
Can you believe it?

06:25.561 --> 06:26.533
Yes.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.889
You know, I wanna help, Annie.

06:27.890 --> 06:30.151
Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, Pierce.

06:30.152 --> 06:32.982
- Come on, now.
- I'm not taking money from you.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.525
It's not mine. It's yours.

06:35.526 --> 06:38.086
You've earned it for being strong.

06:38.137 --> 06:42.038
It's going to drop into your
hands from out of nowhere.

06:42.883 --> 06:44.510
Because I was never here.

06:47.292 --> 06:48.729
Okay. I'm only taking this

06:48.730 --> 06:50.345
because I'm a little
worried about making rent,

06:50.346 --> 06:51.744
and they told me the
procedure for selling eggs

06:51.745 --> 06:52.646
takes three weeks.

06:52.647 --> 06:54.395
You save your eggs
for a rainy day.

06:54.396 --> 06:55.706
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:56.612 --> 06:57.665
Pierce?

07:05.789 --> 07:08.320
Hey, why did you
follow me here today?

07:08.577 --> 07:10.941
Oh! It was nothing, it...

07:10.942 --> 07:13.050
Seems sort of pointless now.

07:13.653 --> 07:15.300
I guess just to
talk about the play

07:15.301 --> 07:18.372
and...Who cares if I
don't have any lines?

07:18.373 --> 07:19.797
Well, you know what, Pierce?

07:19.798 --> 07:21.324
You should do that
line you improvised.

07:21.325 --> 07:23.525
- "Don't call me honey, honey"?
- Yeah, that's it.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.532
You should do that.

07:24.725 --> 07:27.417
You were the Gerber Baby
of moist towelettes, right?

07:28.035 --> 07:29.809
Yes. Yes, I was.

07:31.176 --> 07:31.905
Action!

07:31.906 --> 07:35.299
Hello. I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.

07:35.481 --> 07:38.545
One rainy day, my son Pierce and I

07:38.546 --> 07:40.578
were taking a stroll
when I discovered

07:40.579 --> 07:44.708
the cleansing power of moist cotton,
fresh from the field.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.242
Isn't that right, son?

07:46.446 --> 07:48.140
It sure is.

07:48.141 --> 07:50.007
It sure is, dad!

07:50.008 --> 07:52.196
Pierce, knock it off.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.448
I wanna be in the
commercial too, father.

07:55.449 --> 07:57.076
Well, then you
should have done better

07:57.077 --> 07:58.626
in your damn audition.

07:59.455 --> 08:00.649
What's your name, son?

08:00.884 --> 08:02.066
Nigel.

08:02.325 --> 08:04.292
You're a good boy, Nigel.

08:04.293 --> 08:06.377
Your father is a lucky man.

08:15.318 --> 08:16.290
Okay, guys, remember,

08:16.291 --> 08:18.442
the most important
thing is to have fun!

08:18.443 --> 08:19.393
And the second most
important thing

08:19.394 --> 08:20.637
is to know all your lines
and all your blocking

08:20.638 --> 08:23.409
and not mess up a single thing.
Actually... flip those.

08:23.947 --> 08:26.469
Here we go, guys.
I took the liberty

08:26.470 --> 08:28.332
of juicing up some of our bits.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.328
Um...But...

08:29.329 --> 08:31.917
Pierce, you can't just
revise Annie's script.

08:32.203 --> 08:34.149
And who uses wite-out anymore?

08:34.258 --> 08:35.842
Why don't we look
over Pierce's changes

08:35.844 --> 08:38.518
and see if they improve things?

08:38.707 --> 08:40.576
"Hey, Crayon, do you know
where I can get some drugs?

08:40.577 --> 08:41.770
I need them."

08:41.789 --> 08:43.929
"Unfortunately,
you can get them anywhere."

08:43.931 --> 08:45.779
- "Anywhere?"
- I'm here!

08:45.780 --> 08:47.376
Zabba-da-zooey!

08:51.571 --> 08:52.527
Good one.

08:53.782 --> 08:55.076
Well, doesn't seem
to hurt anything,

08:55.077 --> 08:57.873
so let's get into costume
and break a stinger!

08:58.476 --> 08:59.545
For the bees.

09:00.012 --> 09:01.501
Annie, uh...

09:01.502 --> 09:04.653
I-I don't feel comfortable
with the zabba-da-zooey line.

09:04.654 --> 09:05.764
The one you wrote?

09:05.765 --> 09:06.850
I got it!

09:06.998 --> 09:09.196
Let's give Jeff the
zabba-da-zooey line,

09:09.197 --> 09:11.036
and then I'll come
in with a good one.

09:11.037 --> 09:13.136
- Yeah...
- It's more my voice.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.760
Pretty sure Jeff is
gonna reject that idea.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.652
Yeah, you're probably right.

09:16.653 --> 09:18.019
You're the producer.

09:18.749 --> 09:21.033
By the way, is this your pen?

09:21.502 --> 09:22.599
I...think I put it
back in my pocket

09:22.600 --> 09:25.116
after I wrote you
that check yesterday.

09:26.713 --> 09:27.997
I'll give it to you later.

09:28.079 --> 09:29.189
I'll talk to Jeff.

09:29.190 --> 09:31.126
Also, I think it'd be
better for my character

09:31.127 --> 09:32.694
if I wear his leather jacket.

09:34.837 --> 09:35.857
Okay!

09:35.966 --> 09:39.465
Welcome to Greendale's
Drug Awareness Show!

09:41.413 --> 09:43.221
Okay. Our volunteers

09:43.222 --> 09:48.103
are handing out drug-free
baseballs, huh?

09:48.247 --> 09:50.503
Next time you think about drugs,

09:50.504 --> 09:53.235
think about baseball instead.

09:54.952 --> 09:56.755
Can't ignore me forever.

09:58.575 --> 10:00.091
Okay, you probably can...

10:01.950 --> 10:03.395
I don't know why you want to.

10:04.578 --> 10:06.465
I don't know if I told
you my nephew Marcus

10:06.466 --> 10:08.288
actually goes to San
Ramone middle school,

10:08.289 --> 10:10.058
and he's coming to see the show.

10:10.059 --> 10:12.577
- Marcus? Your nephew?
- Yeah, he's 14.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.290
I actually thought he
didn't even like me,

10:14.291 --> 10:16.401
but then he texted me out
of nowhere and he said,

10:16.402 --> 10:17.189
"Can't wait to see you.

10:17.190 --> 10:18.885
"I've been looking forward
to this for so long.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.133
You are the coolest
aunt in the world."

10:21.134 --> 10:22.858
I hope that I don't let him down.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.184
- You'll be great.
- What does this symbol mean?

10:25.185 --> 10:26.714
It's a number eight,
an equal sign,

10:26.715 --> 10:28.024
and then a greater than symbol.

10:28.025 --> 10:29.165
Let me see.

10:29.574 --> 10:30.402
You'd better get changed.

10:30.403 --> 10:31.563
I'll hang onto your stuff for you.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.530
Great.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.201
Abed, we screwed up.

10:37.202 --> 10:38.570
You know that text we sent?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.221
It was to Britta's nephew.

10:40.369 --> 10:42.328
He sent her an emoti-penis.

10:42.329 --> 10:43.587
What are we gonna do?

10:47.825 --> 10:48.935
Fine. Screw you, Abed.

10:48.936 --> 10:50.221
I can fix this.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.405
"Marcus, I made a mistake.

10:52.406 --> 10:54.643
I texted the wrong
person last night."

10:58.271 --> 11:00.511
"You called me by name.
It wasn't a mistake.

11:00.512 --> 11:01.821
Don't be afraid."

11:04.448 --> 11:05.644
Screw you, Abed.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.681
"I was drunk. We can't do this."

11:10.685 --> 11:13.217
"I'm drunk too. On lust."

11:13.544 --> 11:14.697
There's a picture.

11:14.876 --> 11:16.924
Oh! That's disappointing.

11:16.925 --> 11:18.739
Wow, who does that? That's...

11:18.740 --> 11:21.243
Bees, you're up.
Cool cats, your on deck.

11:21.911 --> 11:24.277
- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.

11:24.278 --> 11:25.722
Drugs are like special honey.

11:25.723 --> 11:27.930
They give you a buzzzzzzz.

11:27.931 --> 11:30.422
Don't call me "honey," honey.

11:33.251 --> 11:34.824
Are you ignoring me
because I'm Korean?

11:34.825 --> 11:36.567
- You're Chinese.
- Oh, there's a difference?

11:36.568 --> 11:37.651
Shh!

11:38.396 --> 11:40.480
It's because you're crazy,
all right?

11:40.571 --> 11:41.681
There's something wrong with you.

11:41.682 --> 11:44.271
And the idea that I was with you

11:44.619 --> 11:46.367
means there's something
wrong with me,

11:46.490 --> 11:48.010
and if this baby...

11:48.982 --> 11:50.994
If you have any humanity at all,

11:50.995 --> 11:52.380
you will not make
me think about it.

11:52.381 --> 11:53.545
Shirley, funeral.

12:01.672 --> 12:03.230
Well, that answers my question.

12:03.231 --> 12:07.559
Jeff Winger is sexy
even in a coffin. Mmm!

12:13.820 --> 12:14.677
I'm here.

12:14.678 --> 12:16.590
Pierce, you're
supposed to be onstage.

12:16.591 --> 12:18.380
I was looking for a lighter.

12:19.151 --> 12:21.103
What are you wearing?
This is a funeral.

12:21.104 --> 12:22.347
I got this, Annie.

12:23.093 --> 12:25.065
I can't believe Fluffy's dead.

12:25.066 --> 12:28.342
I know I'm green, but I feel blue.

12:31.673 --> 12:35.145
Look, it's Drugs with a
crazy wig and sparklers.

12:35.146 --> 12:37.781
♪ Pokemon ♪

12:39.074 --> 12:40.955
I don't think
that's right, Drugs.

12:40.956 --> 12:43.568
Nobody asked you, Crayon.

12:45.114 --> 12:46.233
Oh! Oh!

12:49.922 --> 12:51.682
Well, I hope you're
proud of yourself, Drugs.

12:51.683 --> 12:52.898
Look what you've done.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.607
Oh, yeah? Well,
look what I'm doing now.

13:00.315 --> 13:02.847
Smells like something
died in here.

13:05.890 --> 13:06.623
What do you want us to do?

13:06.624 --> 13:07.407
Should we get the dean?

13:07.408 --> 13:08.894
Should we call in a bomb threat?

13:08.895 --> 13:10.247
Should we set off the sprinklers?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.272
It's not that big a deal.

13:11.273 --> 13:12.399
I think the kids are into it.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.791
Yeah, but I don't think that
they're getting the message.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.119
Yeah, but do kids
ever really seem

13:16.120 --> 13:17.544
like they're getting the message?

13:17.545 --> 13:19.028
I think it's sinking in.

13:19.029 --> 13:20.336
Well, I guess it's your call.

13:20.337 --> 13:22.208
And anyway, he's about to
get flushed down the toilet

13:22.209 --> 13:24.278
in the next scene,
and he'll be done.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.975
I wish I had never
even met Drugs.

13:30.938 --> 13:33.165
Who invited the
nerd from the beehive?

13:34.186 --> 13:35.448
Drugs made you.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.616
How about you leave, Drugs?

13:42.861 --> 13:45.038
Zip, pop, zoom.

13:45.039 --> 13:47.086
Whoosh!

13:50.519 --> 13:51.720
They want more.

13:51.721 --> 13:52.934
I gotta go back out there.

13:52.935 --> 13:55.075
But Pierce, you were flushed.
That was the story.

13:55.076 --> 13:56.978
That's what's supposed
to happen to Drugs.

13:56.979 --> 13:58.802
Being flushed doesn't
necessarily mean you're dead.

13:58.803 --> 14:01.199
I mean, I could be a floater.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.765
You know, a floater is when
you have a number two...

14:03.766 --> 14:05.823
I know what a floater is,
Pierce.

14:05.824 --> 14:07.462
It just... it wouldn't
make any sense

14:07.463 --> 14:10.574
in the flow of the show,
and it sends a mixed message.

14:10.575 --> 14:12.156
You know what I think
is a mixed message?

14:12.157 --> 14:14.763
Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent,
and today you can.

14:15.629 --> 14:18.068
Come on, Annie.
You and I are alike.

14:18.069 --> 14:20.713
We're independent.
We need each other.

14:22.123 --> 14:25.146
♪ yi yi yi yi yi

14:25.147 --> 14:27.895
Bzzz! Getting rid of
Drugs is a great I-bee-a.

14:28.386 --> 14:30.474
I'm flying higher
than I ever have,

14:30.475 --> 14:32.391
thanks to not Drugs.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.604
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:37.405 --> 14:38.398
Ow! Hey!

14:39.631 --> 14:41.387
I'm back!

14:43.768 --> 14:47.340
Ain't no party without Drugs!

14:57.725 --> 14:59.529
I love you, Drugs!

15:06.276 --> 15:08.064
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

15:08.065 --> 15:10.993
Listen to that!
They're high on me!

15:10.994 --> 15:12.279
I'm a God!

15:13.978 --> 15:16.100
Where is that Nigel now?

15:16.385 --> 15:18.701
And I haven't even used
my penis material yet.

15:18.702 --> 15:20.015
Pierce, enough!

15:20.016 --> 15:22.046
After intermission, I'm going
back to the original script

15:22.047 --> 15:23.600
and doing some damage control.

15:23.601 --> 15:24.520
Damage?

15:24.521 --> 15:25.678
The only damage is me

15:25.679 --> 15:27.643
blowing the roof off the universe.

15:27.644 --> 15:30.146
I am not letting you
go back on that stage!

15:30.147 --> 15:31.787
Well, maybe I won't
be visiting you

15:31.788 --> 15:35.136
late at night anymore
with a generous spirit.

15:37.564 --> 15:42.155
You sick, sick, sad old man.

15:42.156 --> 15:44.011
This is why I didn't want to
take money from my parents.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.762
I don't want anybody
pulling my strings.

15:45.763 --> 15:48.278
Wait, wait.
Is he giving you money?

15:48.279 --> 15:49.427
Not anymore.

15:49.428 --> 15:50.403
That's why the
script got changed.

15:50.404 --> 15:52.841
Pierce bought his way in.
Annie sold out her message.

15:52.976 --> 15:55.102
You've been
indulging this maniac?

15:56.436 --> 15:59.650
Yes. I've been
indulging this maniac.

16:01.229 --> 16:03.303
- You're fired. 
- Fired?

16:03.304 --> 16:04.871
Next time I'm at Dildopolis,

16:04.872 --> 16:07.173
I will not be coming
upstairs to say hi.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.672
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

16:10.673 --> 16:12.407
The only reason we
did this was for you

16:12.408 --> 16:13.759
and your stupid ideals,

16:13.760 --> 16:15.630
and it turns out you
don't even have any.

16:15.631 --> 16:17.098
We supported you, Annie.

16:17.099 --> 16:19.024
Yeah, Annie, you're fired.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.935
I'm sorry!

16:22.139 --> 16:23.446
Here's the situation.

16:23.447 --> 16:25.975
We've got 50 at-risk preteens,

16:25.976 --> 16:28.599
armed with baseballs,
chanting for Drugs,

16:28.600 --> 16:29.498
who just spent intermission

16:29.499 --> 16:32.209
eating nothing but
Charleston Chews, thank God.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.775
Hope you can top act one,
is all I'm saying.

16:35.019 --> 16:36.951
Oh! Whoops.

16:38.021 --> 16:39.462
We want Drugs!

16:39.463 --> 16:41.412
- Should we bail?
- Works for me.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.159
Wait!

16:42.160 --> 16:44.112
We want Drugs!

16:44.884 --> 16:46.313
Listen to those kids.

16:46.743 --> 16:49.220
We just created 50
potential meth heads,

16:49.221 --> 16:51.278
and the least we can do
is hit the reset button

16:51.279 --> 16:53.751
and get that number down
to the national average.

16:53.752 --> 16:54.955
That's a suicide mission.

16:54.956 --> 16:57.644
Did someone say crazy person?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.412
No.

17:00.943 --> 17:02.303
Well, I heard it.

17:02.304 --> 17:05.829
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

17:05.830 --> 17:08.492
Greetings, you little snots!

17:10.471 --> 17:11.648
You're not Drugs.

17:11.650 --> 17:13.523
Oh, but I am!

17:13.747 --> 17:15.685
Disappointed?

17:16.114 --> 17:19.708
Did you expect me to
stay the same forever?

17:19.709 --> 17:22.521
'Cause that's not
what drug does, baby.

17:23.002 --> 17:26.378
I'm gonna deep-fry your dog
and eat your mama's face

17:26.535 --> 17:30.369
and I'm gonna wear your little
brother's skin like pajamas.

17:30.498 --> 17:32.831
I control your lives

17:32.832 --> 17:36.002
and there is nothing you can do!

17:36.686 --> 17:37.826
Let's kill him!

17:37.827 --> 17:39.839
Oh, bring it on, bow-wow.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.716
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my!

17:41.889 --> 17:43.013
Aah! Aah!

17:45.295 --> 17:46.827
Is that all you've got?

17:47.415 --> 17:48.388
I gotta tell you, Annie,

17:48.389 --> 17:50.700
this is the greatest
chemical dependency program

17:50.701 --> 17:52.301
I have ever watched.

17:52.461 --> 17:53.532
I mean, the way you got the kids

17:53.533 --> 17:55.557
to think that they needed Drugs,

17:55.558 --> 17:56.852
and then having them realize

17:56.853 --> 17:58.508
that dependence was the enemy,

17:58.509 --> 17:59.949
that the price was just too high.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.274
Oh, genius.

18:02.318 --> 18:03.895
So now that the show is over,

18:03.896 --> 18:06.618
what is the plan for
these bee costumes?

18:06.619 --> 18:08.925
Aah! Aah! Uncle!

18:09.180 --> 18:11.184
Hi, Marcus. I'm Jeff.

18:11.185 --> 18:14.303
I'm like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.772
Look, dude,
she started it, okay?

18:15.773 --> 18:17.396
- She's just as into me.
- No, listen, listen.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.253
I'm not mad.

18:18.254 --> 18:19.404
I was just fooling around,

18:19.405 --> 18:21.048
and I sent those texts.

18:21.902 --> 18:22.643
- Gross.
- Yeah.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.754
Well, it was pretty disgusting,

18:23.755 --> 18:25.543
sending those
pictures to your aunt.

18:25.544 --> 18:27.002
More disgusting
than what you texted

18:27.003 --> 18:28.169
to an underage boy?

18:28.170 --> 18:29.656
Yeah, well,
I didn't know you were you.

18:29.657 --> 18:31.168
And I didn't know
you weren't my aunt.

18:31.169 --> 18:31.699
Okay, all right,

18:31.700 --> 18:33.575
let's just call this a draw.

18:33.650 --> 18:35.723
Britta doesn't need to
ever know about this.

18:35.724 --> 18:38.720
Okay, I'd be happy to,
for a price.

18:40.634 --> 18:42.223
That was brave of you.

18:42.906 --> 18:44.865
I owe you an apology.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.103
It was rude to call you crazy.

18:47.587 --> 18:49.607
Maybe I haven't been
giving you enough credit.

18:50.452 --> 18:53.154
Oh, that's really sweet.
Tell you what.

18:53.155 --> 18:56.616
Why don't I go get Chang?
You can tell him that yourself.

18:59.451 --> 19:01.476
- Oh, no.
- My God, that was amazing!

19:01.624 --> 19:03.193
- Wow!
- Good job!

19:03.194 --> 19:05.159
- Thanks!
- Amazing!

19:05.251 --> 19:07.092
Way to go, man,
go! That was awesome.

19:07.093 --> 19:08.930
They beat the crap out of you.

19:09.894 --> 19:10.908
It's okay.
I did a lot of ad-libbing.

19:10.909 --> 19:14.070
Guys, I'm so sorry.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.426
Thank you so much.
That was amazing.

19:16.615 --> 19:17.777
Even I learned something.

19:17.778 --> 19:20.165
- Oh, Annie.
- We did it.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.532
- Group hug, group hug.
- Hug, hug.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.573
- Way to save the day.
- Nice work.

19:25.857 --> 19:28.243
Did you get hit in the
face with a baseball?

19:28.244 --> 19:28.906
Yep.

19:28.907 --> 19:30.457
Annie, before you say anything,

19:30.458 --> 19:31.912
I just want you to know,

19:32.028 --> 19:33.402
even though I did nothing wrong,

19:33.403 --> 19:34.308
I'm still gonna give you money.

19:34.309 --> 19:36.663
No. I can't take
your money, Pierce.

19:36.664 --> 19:38.572
I can't go from
depending on my parents

19:38.573 --> 19:39.878
to depending on you,

19:39.879 --> 19:42.447
which is why I'm gonna get a job.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.254
So you're cutting me off?

19:44.387 --> 19:45.195
No.

19:45.196 --> 19:48.148
Pierce, I know you
don't depend on anyone,

19:48.149 --> 19:50.650
but you do depend on
people depending on you,

19:51.122 --> 19:52.613
so I'm not gonna take your money.

19:53.162 --> 19:54.337
We're still friends?

19:54.338 --> 19:55.495
Give me a day.

19:56.393 --> 19:57.404
By the way,

19:57.616 --> 19:59.773
your mom was the
Period Fairy, right?

20:00.593 --> 20:01.920
Hey, guys, I found my phone,

20:01.921 --> 20:03.804
but has anyone seen my bra?

20:11.105 --> 20:12.397
It's 2:00 A.M.

20:12.398 --> 20:15.776
Time for Dildopolis's
night-owl deals.

20:16.231 --> 20:17.328
Please be advised,

20:17.329 --> 20:19.591
we will be closed
for President's Day.

20:19.592 --> 20:20.530
Just kidding.

20:20.531 --> 20:22.486
Dildopolis never closes.

20:23.107 --> 20:26.672
At Dildopolis, your privacy
is our top concern.

20:26.673 --> 20:29.096
All store purchases will
show up on your credit card

20:29.097 --> 20:32.202
as ABC Dildos, incorporated.

20:32.521 --> 20:33.877
Shop until you drop.

20:33.878 --> 20:36.024
Take a load off at
our in-store cafe

20:36.025 --> 20:37.153
and enjoy an espresso

20:37.154 --> 20:40.927
or our signature
cinnamon biscotti.
