WEBVTT

00:13.875 --> 00:17.208
<i> Now I trust you all understand</i>
<i>the gravity of the situation.</i>

00:17.916 --> 00:20.458
<i>So, until we are sure</i>
<i>about how we're going to proceed,</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:25.041
nobody can know any of the details
of what happened at the graveyard today.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.541
Nobody can know
that any of the fairies at this school

00:28.625 --> 00:30.375
no longer control the Dragon Flame.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500
Sorry, I know it's a big deal
that Bloom kill…

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
That Rosalind's dead.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.416
But in my humble opinion,

00:38.500 --> 00:40.958
it's a bigger deal
that Rosalind murdered Miss Dowling.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.125
Yes, but the only thing
we know for certain

00:43.208 --> 00:45.625
is the first part of that sentence.

00:47.583 --> 00:48.416
Thank you, Sky.

00:49.458 --> 00:52.291
Now, I have made an agreement with Bavani

00:53.666 --> 00:57.458
that should keep Bloom out of confinement.

00:57.541 --> 00:58.458
What are those?

00:58.541 --> 01:00.833
Torture devices
to stop Bloom using her magic.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.708
The crystal is why she lost control.

01:02.791 --> 01:05.291
She discharged her magic into it.
She's not a risk anymore.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.875
-I'm afraid those were the terms.
-It's okay.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.041
I did it. I'm not gonna fight.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.958
Bavani will convene a tribunal

01:19.041 --> 01:21.375
to determine the consequences
of Bloom's actions.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.666
Queen Luna will preside over it.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.000
Lovely.

01:26.083 --> 01:28.750
So, you expect us to go to class
like everything's normal?

01:28.833 --> 01:32.541
No, because everything is not normal.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.791
Queen Luna is making an address.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.416
<i>Citizens of Solaria,</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:44.708
<i>I have tragic news.</i>

01:44.791 --> 01:49.583
<i>Rosalind Hale,</i>
<i>headmistress of Alfea, is dead.</i>

01:51.166 --> 01:52.416
<i>It is a grave loss</i>

01:52.500 --> 01:57.458
<i>not only for the students of Alfea</i>
<i>but for the entire realm.</i>

01:57.541 --> 02:02.250
<i>Rosalind was one of the bravest fairies</i>
<i>the Otherworld has ever seen.</i>

02:02.875 --> 02:07.333
<i>Respected by her peers.</i>
<i>Feared by her enemies.</i>

02:07.416 --> 02:10.958
<i>But fear will not dictate how we respond.</i>

02:11.041 --> 02:14.875
<i>There is a guilty party,</i>
<i>and they will be brought to justice.</i>

02:18.166 --> 02:19.083
<i>Blood Witches.</i>

02:20.083 --> 02:22.416
<i>Their hatred of our kind is well known.</i>

02:22.500 --> 02:25.291
<i>But a heinous act such as this</i>
<i>is unprecedented,</i>

02:25.375 --> 02:28.458
<i>carried out by their leader,</i>
<i>Sebastian Valtor.</i>

02:29.625 --> 02:33.791
<i>Every Blood Witch following him</i>
<i>is considered an enemy of the Crown.</i>

02:34.666 --> 02:37.375
<i>We will use the full weight</i>
<i>of our military against them.</i>

02:37.958 --> 02:39.208
<i>And make no mistake…</i>

02:41.458 --> 02:43.708
<i>this is an act of war.</i>

03:06.166 --> 03:08.625
I'm sure there's
a kinder way to do this, but…

03:08.708 --> 03:11.125
Light fairy. Sorry, not sorry.

03:13.041 --> 03:13.958
How did you sleep?

03:14.041 --> 03:16.083
What's sleep?

03:22.375 --> 03:25.041
Every time I close my eyes,
I'm back in the graveyard.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.041
It's all blurry, like… I can barely
even remember what happened.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.000
Okay, let me remember it for you.

03:36.666 --> 03:39.875
Sebastian took advantage of you
in a vulnerable moment.

03:40.375 --> 03:41.833
He revealed a horrific truth,

03:41.916 --> 03:45.250
that Rosalind killed Miss Dowling
in cold blood.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.208
Confronted with her crime,
Rosalind attacked you.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.125
You acted in self-defense.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.708
-Yeah, that makes sense.
-Of course it does.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.625
And I intend to prove it to the tribunal.

03:58.875 --> 04:02.041
Solarian law is Byzantine, but,

04:02.125 --> 04:03.791
though luckily for you,

04:03.875 --> 04:07.625
I spent many long nights
with many tedious tutors studying it, so…

04:07.708 --> 04:09.750
You're a lot of things, Bloom.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.083
Most of them amazing.
Some of them annoying.

04:14.375 --> 04:19.000
None of them murdery
or even murdery adjacent. Trust me.

04:19.083 --> 04:23.333
Terra and Flora will find proof
of Dowling's murder to support your case.

04:24.666 --> 04:27.916
What if, you know,
she disagrees with the case?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.500
This particular instance
has never happened before,

04:30.583 --> 04:32.416
but as there is a death involved,

04:32.500 --> 04:36.125
that could mean anything
from minor confinement to banishment.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.125
Tough love time. Uh…

04:40.958 --> 04:42.791
This Bloom? Not helpful.

04:42.875 --> 04:46.125
If my mum sees some sad sack
second-guessing herself,

04:46.208 --> 04:47.500
she will eat you alive.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.916
You're the Dragon Flame, Bloom,
and you did nothing wrong.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.208
The realm needs you.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.541
We need you.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.416
-Don't understand why we're not fighting.
-Because you're still students, Dane.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.708
No, we're Specialists.
This is what we've been training for.

05:13.791 --> 05:17.000
No, you've been training
so you can fight when you graduate.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.625
If you wanna be a soldier,
why don't you impress the Solarians

05:19.708 --> 05:21.958
with a well-stocked supply depot, huh?

05:22.041 --> 05:23.375
Waste of talent.

05:23.458 --> 05:27.208
Basically, we're fucking grunts,
and we have to enjoy being fucking grunts.

05:27.291 --> 05:31.291
Uh, language and attitude. Both of yous.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

05:33.791 --> 05:37.125
-How's Bloom doing?
-Yeah, she's good. She's in bed.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.541
Nothing like being accused of murder
to give you time to catch up on Netflix.

05:41.375 --> 05:45.000
Lot of crate action going on.
Looks like you could use some help.

05:45.541 --> 05:48.666
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but we've got enough Specialists.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.625
If only they'd work more
and complain less.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.083
And you don't need any more Specialists?

05:57.416 --> 06:00.083
I don't have any magic,
but I'd like to stay at Alfea.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.166
I just thought if I became a Specialist…

06:02.916 --> 06:05.375
-Now's not the best time, Musa.
-Why not?

06:05.458 --> 06:07.375
We're just supplying Solaria, right?

06:08.041 --> 06:09.166
I'm only half-kidding.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.166
I can easily start her up
on a training regimen in our downtime.

06:12.250 --> 06:16.250
What downtime?
This isn't fucking daycare. No offense.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.458
Wasn't clever enough
to offend me. No offense.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.291
I will literally do anything.

06:27.958 --> 06:30.541
So, it's like
a Mr. Miyagi situation, right?

06:30.625 --> 06:33.791
-He's teaching us something.
-Yeah, how to shovel shit.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.708
This is gonna take all week.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.000
Well done. Keep it up.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.666
It'll take forever to make
enough of this for the Solarian army.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.083
We don't even know
if it'll work on Blood Witch magic.

07:00.583 --> 07:04.583
LeRoy seems convinced it will,
and she has a pretty good track record.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.791
-Let's just hope she's distracted enough.
-Okay.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.875
You promise
we won't have to dig up Dowling's corpse?

07:27.958 --> 07:31.208
No, no grave-digging.
We just need proof she's there.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.958
Stella can't claim self-defense

07:33.041 --> 07:35.208
unless Dowling's body
is where Rosalind said--

07:35.291 --> 07:36.916
Kat! Hi.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.708
Hey, Terra.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.416
Flora.

07:42.125 --> 07:45.666
Sorry, you're probably wondering
what we're doing here. Let me tell you.

07:45.750 --> 07:49.625
-Um, we were just, um…
-We're going for a walk in the graveyard.

07:49.708 --> 07:51.458
Last I checked,
that wasn't against the rules.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.083
It is now. Sorry.

07:53.625 --> 07:57.250
No students roaming around outside.
Blood Witches could be anywhere.

08:03.541 --> 08:05.791
You don't have to tell me
what you're up to.

08:05.875 --> 08:09.875
Probably shouldn't, to be honest.
But I'm on duty alone tomorrow morning.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.625
Might have better luck
sneaking by me then.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.500
Hm.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.833
-Disappointing.
-Mm-hmm.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.000
Yet somehow still promising.

08:23.916 --> 08:27.375
Focus, lover girl. Tribunal's
in the morning. Timing's gonna be tight.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.458
Okay.

08:47.791 --> 08:48.791
Bloom?

08:50.125 --> 08:52.041
Aisha said you… you were laying low.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.958
I thought maybe we could lay low together.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.250
I know you're probably
worrying about the tribunal.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.541
Bloom?

09:03.083 --> 09:04.083
Talk to me.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.833
Hey.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.875
Weird I'm calling, I know.
But I didn't wanna triple-text.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.791
Is a phone call more or less mortifying?

09:26.541 --> 09:27.875
Don't answer that. Um…

09:29.083 --> 09:32.041
I checked your room and the Bastion.
Nobody's seen you.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.583
But I'm headed for a swim,
in case you wanna join?

09:38.083 --> 09:40.708
Look, I know you wanted
to talk with me yesterday.

09:40.791 --> 09:44.625
Sorry, it's taken me a second.
Things got a bit out of hand and…

09:46.875 --> 09:48.041
Just call me back.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.541
You made it. Perfect.

10:15.416 --> 10:16.750
Welcome home.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.083
Dad, she's crazy. You know that.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.583
Bloom! Help me.

11:41.541 --> 11:43.291
-Mom?
-Get her out of here!

11:44.625 --> 11:46.291
Please!

11:56.833 --> 11:57.666
Sorry.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.000
Didn't realize Aisha's snoring
was that bad.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.541
Well, twist, it's me.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.916
Thought she could use a…

12:08.000 --> 12:10.125
…good night's sleep.

12:13.416 --> 12:16.000
Isn't it dangerous
for you to be out here alone?

12:16.625 --> 12:17.458
With no magic.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.875
I didn't wanna take the risk.
If something happened when I was asleep…

12:22.958 --> 12:23.958
Bloom.

12:24.458 --> 12:26.125
Please, Sky.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.500
I'm not scared of you, okay?

12:29.583 --> 12:30.666
You should be.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.416
My emotions are what triggered this, Sky.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.375
And the way I feel about you, I mean, I…

12:43.125 --> 12:45.791
What if we get in a fight,
and what if I lost control?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.000
We really need to keep our distance.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.000
Look, Bloom, I'm your boyfriend.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.500
If we can't be in the same room together,
how are we--

12:57.583 --> 12:59.625
I need… I need to get some rest tonight.

13:04.166 --> 13:07.000
If I don't,
Stella's gonna kill me tomorrow.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.333
We'll figure this out
after the tribunal.

13:20.791 --> 13:23.083
-We can fix this.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.333
What the…

14:06.416 --> 14:08.500
Did the shit fairy come last night?

14:09.875 --> 14:12.708
-Don't ever call me that again.
-You did this?

14:12.791 --> 14:15.166
Didn't want Grumpy
to have an excuses not to train me.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.083
I'm happy not to be shoveling,
but it's not gonna happen.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.250
Afraid of being beaten by a girl?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.541
-Riv--
-No.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.500
-She wants a lesson. Let's go.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.500
-You're dead. Again.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.666
Look at that. More dead. Again.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.500
Why are you being such a dick?

15:01.583 --> 15:04.083
Any minute now,
we might get called to an actual war.

15:04.583 --> 15:07.416
Specialists aren't just randoms
picked up off the street.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.333
We're selected. We train for years.

15:10.416 --> 15:13.625
And you think you can just figure it out?
It's insulting.

15:13.708 --> 15:15.833
You could get hurt, Musa.
Or worse, killed.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.791
And it's dangerous to everyone else.

15:17.875 --> 15:22.041
So go ahead, play dress up. It's not like
there's more important things going on.

15:31.375 --> 15:36.125
-<i>When did you last see her?</i>

15:36.208 --> 15:38.541
When Rosalind took over,
we had a cordial chat,

15:38.625 --> 15:40.500
but that's about it.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.208
<i> So, the gem?</i>

15:44.291 --> 15:48.416
She'll probably pretend it's not there,
which is a good thing.

15:49.333 --> 15:53.541
<i>It's not what today is about.</i>
<i>Bloom's future is in my mum's hands.</i>

15:54.083 --> 15:57.916
There's water in there,
but if you need anything more medicinal…

16:01.583 --> 16:02.625
Thanks, I'm good.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.625
Mother, it's so good to see you.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.166
-Um.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.708
I think it's best if the students
think you're here to visit me.

16:13.791 --> 16:14.791
Hmm.

16:15.916 --> 16:16.916
Shall we?

16:20.750 --> 16:24.208
No matter what, killing Rosalind
was the best thing you've ever done.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.250
She deserved it.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.458
If you'll excuse us.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
Won't be a moment.

16:36.916 --> 16:39.125
I left water on the desk for your mum.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.083
Chilled, four lemons, sparkling.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.291
I remember you saying
how weird she was about her water.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.875
Thank you, Beatrix.

16:53.041 --> 16:54.041
Right.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.083
I ate breakfast outside this morning.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.833
-Mm.
-In the sun.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.583
-I needed some color.
-Small miracles.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.333
Well, I am the Dragon Flame after all, so…

17:06.416 --> 17:08.333
Look, my mum can be tricky.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.541
But I am her daughter,
and I can be tricky too.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.666
So we have a few layers of defense.

17:14.916 --> 17:18.333
I've been reading up on settled law
so she can't trip me up.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.625
We'll get proof of Rosalind's crimes
from Terra and Flora.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.250
And our <i>coup de grâce?</i>

17:23.333 --> 17:26.166
A prominent Solarian
and unimpeachable character witness.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.791
-Let's not oversell me here.
-Overselling is the name of the game.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.166
Your family supplies energy
for half of the realm.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.208
My mum cannot piss them off.

17:35.791 --> 17:38.083
Okay? It's enough to make her listen.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.500
Let's just hope
Terra and Flora come through.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.500
What have we here?
Could it be an official bribe?

17:50.375 --> 17:52.625
I don't know if you should
call a bribe a bribe, but…

17:55.500 --> 17:56.541
Oh my God.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.125
-Tobian rock snails. How did you…

18:01.833 --> 18:05.083
These must have taken you
at least a week to get.

18:05.166 --> 18:09.333
I will admit they weren't originally
meant to be a bribe when I sourced them.

18:09.416 --> 18:12.166
Thought I could cook them for you

18:12.250 --> 18:15.500
in… in, like, a date-type situation.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.375
Oh. Shit.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.333
Terra-

18:19.416 --> 18:21.291
Oh no. No. I've done it again.

18:21.375 --> 18:24.791
I've misread this.
I'm so sorry. That is mortifying.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.875
You didn't misread anything. You…

18:28.291 --> 18:29.666
You're fucking amazing.

18:32.958 --> 18:34.666
Francesca and I got back together.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.666
Oh, well, that makes sense.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.083
Well,

18:40.833 --> 18:42.750
I'm really happy for you.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.666
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

18:46.791 --> 18:47.916
Enjoy your lunch.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.000
Apologies for the delay,
but, as you can imagine,

19:07.083 --> 19:10.416
we're… quite busy at the moment.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.458
Thank you for your help, Stella,
but this is a closed tribunal.

19:17.541 --> 19:19.208
I'm acting as Bloom's advocate.

19:19.291 --> 19:23.083
Admirable, but in a closed tribunal,
advocates are not permitted.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.500
I realize that.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.875
However, you did permit Arthur
to act as advocate

19:27.958 --> 19:30.916
when his companion found himself
in a financial scandal, so…

19:32.250 --> 19:34.250
I assume I'd be afforded
the same privilege.

19:36.083 --> 19:40.625
Bloom, are you aware of how serious
the charges are against you?

19:40.708 --> 19:41.541
I am.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.583
And this is your choice?

19:43.666 --> 19:45.916
-To have my daughter as your advocate?
-Yes.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.166
-Stella knows the system better than I do.
-I suppose she does.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.916
But then again, I assume
you know nothing about the system, so…

19:56.375 --> 19:57.500
faint praise.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.541
Very well. Here's what I know.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.166
Rosalind,

20:03.875 --> 20:07.666
one of the most beloved
and influential figures of the Otherworld,

20:07.750 --> 20:08.833
is dead.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.791
Last night, Bloom admitted to Saul Silva
that she is the cause.

20:12.875 --> 20:13.791
So…

20:16.000 --> 20:17.375
what don't I know?

20:18.250 --> 20:19.833
She likes you. It wasn't a no.

20:19.916 --> 20:23.375
-I'm fine. The tribunal's started. We--
-Sometimes timing is tricky--

20:23.458 --> 20:24.458
I said I'm fine.

20:25.416 --> 20:28.375
Can you please just pour it,
so we can find Dowling's grave?

20:29.291 --> 20:30.208
Ticktock.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.125
-When bodies die, they decompose.
-I'm aware of basic chemistry.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.083
Sorry.

20:39.291 --> 20:42.166
When fairies die,
they release life essence.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.416
Powerful fairies
have powerful life essence.

20:45.583 --> 20:48.958
This should interact with that
and show us where Rosalind buried

20:49.041 --> 20:52.000
one of the most powerful fairies
of the Otherworld.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.458
<i>You're accusing Rosalind</i>

20:56.541 --> 20:59.791
of murdering Headmistress Dowling?

20:59.875 --> 21:03.041
She risked our lives daily
for training and experimentation.

21:03.125 --> 21:06.250
-Is it that unimaginable?
-Imagination has no place here.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.541
And making unproven accusations
such as that

21:09.625 --> 21:11.708
is damaging only to one person, you.

21:13.666 --> 21:14.791
And if it's proven?

21:14.875 --> 21:18.041
Hearsay and speculation
do not constitute proof.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.250
I'm going to need physical evidence.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.916
Uh, this is a lot of smoke.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Yeah.

21:27.541 --> 21:29.500
Makes sense for a fairy graveyard.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.333
Bloom said it was over here.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.541
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, by the bench.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.333
There's no smoke. What does that mean?

21:45.125 --> 21:47.500
It means a fairy wasn't buried here.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.625
How is that possible?

21:49.708 --> 21:53.833
And neither of you have considered
that Sebastian may have lied?

21:56.750 --> 21:59.041
Uh, yeah, he could have.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.000
But Rosalind admitted it.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.666
To you, alone, in private.

22:05.958 --> 22:09.375
Terra and Flora are in the graveyard
getting the proof that we need.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.666
I just need one minute.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.083
-Please.
-<i> Rosalind must've moved the body.</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:17.791
No, she has to be here.
Rosalind's not getting away with this.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.000
Terra, what are you doing?

22:23.958 --> 22:25.833
There's something there. I can feel it.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.916
Great. Terra, that's all we need.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Almost there.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.541
What is that?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.333
It's a dead end.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.166
Oh well. What a lovely waste of time.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.541
I'm not imagining this and I'm not lying.
Rosalind admitted it.

23:01.625 --> 23:04.625
I think, perhaps,
a character witness might help.

23:12.125 --> 23:12.958
Your Majesty.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.375
Aisha, my time is limited.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.666
I realize that.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.750
However, given how much my family

23:19.833 --> 23:22.416
have contributed to Solaria
over the years…

23:30.416 --> 23:31.416
Thank you.

23:32.708 --> 23:35.000
Do you remember
the first time you used magic?

23:35.625 --> 23:39.208
Mine was not fun,
but it was nothing compared to Bloom's.

23:40.083 --> 23:43.000
She set fire to her house.
She got in a fight with her mum.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.750
-Her magic went haywire, and…

23:49.500 --> 23:52.000
After my first time, I went home in tears.

23:52.791 --> 23:54.250
My mum got me a balloon.

23:55.208 --> 23:58.625
After Bloom's first time,
she slept in a warehouse.

23:58.708 --> 24:02.541
She couldn't tell anyone what happened
because she had no idea what happened.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.958
We take that for granted,
that we grow up knowing what we are.

24:07.708 --> 24:09.916
That our fairy mothers will guide us.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.291
Bloom has felt different her entire life.

24:14.041 --> 24:16.166
She had no one to teach and support her.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.958
So, she's an outsider with control issues?

24:19.041 --> 24:21.166
No, and that's the whole point.

24:22.083 --> 24:25.750
Given everything that's happened to her,
Bloom should be a mess,

24:25.833 --> 24:27.208
but she's not.

24:27.708 --> 24:30.666
She came to Alfea
with an open heart and open mind,

24:30.750 --> 24:33.750
and, in spite of everything
she's been through, she excelled.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.041
With her magic and with her friends.

24:42.416 --> 24:46.000
Bloom lost control yesterday
for one reason and one reason only.

24:47.333 --> 24:50.208
We were trying to help our friend Musa
get her magic back.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.958
Bloom is my best friend.

24:53.541 --> 24:55.541
She's not dangerous. Trust me.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.541
I am, if nothing else,
a very good judge of character.

25:05.291 --> 25:06.791
Oh, are you dating Grey Owens?

25:09.625 --> 25:11.708
You say you're a good judge of character,

25:11.791 --> 25:15.208
but you've spent the entire term
dating a Blood Witch.

25:16.791 --> 25:17.875
Grey?

25:18.833 --> 25:21.041
No, that's a mistake.

25:23.791 --> 25:26.750
Last night, Grey had
an odd run-in with a Specialist.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.875
It caused enough concern
that Silva checked his records.

25:30.541 --> 25:31.791
They're forged.

25:34.875 --> 25:36.375
That's not possible.

25:37.041 --> 25:38.666
Why? Because you know him?

25:39.375 --> 25:41.125
Like you know Bloom?

25:41.208 --> 25:45.250
Or perhaps your judgment
isn't as sound as you believe it to be?

25:48.250 --> 25:51.166
Oh, and I wonder what your family
might think of that.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.333
Thank you, Aisha.

25:57.916 --> 25:58.916
That will be all.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.208
-Aisha.
-Aisha, wait.

26:09.083 --> 26:12.500
You know, you can never truly know
what's in someone's heart.

26:14.583 --> 26:17.250
All you can do
is judge them by their actions.

26:18.875 --> 26:20.541
Do you have Grey's records?

26:20.625 --> 26:22.875
Um, I think so. Why?

26:22.958 --> 26:24.750
I need to see them. Now.

26:25.291 --> 26:28.041
So, any more special guests?

26:29.041 --> 26:30.500
Long-winded speeches?

26:31.833 --> 26:32.833
Please.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.875
Please. Bloom is my friend.

26:35.958 --> 26:37.208
I realize that,

26:37.291 --> 26:41.125
and you've done
an admirable job defending her,

26:42.166 --> 26:43.166
but…

26:44.291 --> 26:46.083
you were correct in your letter.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.833
What letter?

26:52.833 --> 26:55.125
-Please don't.
-What letter?

26:56.458 --> 27:02.708
Stella wrote to me a few days ago
asking to borrow the Convergence Crystal,

27:03.583 --> 27:06.083
and in her letter, she included a warning.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.250
About you.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.250
"She is a ticking time bomb,

27:12.333 --> 27:15.833
but Solaria is well positioned
by my presence in her life."

27:16.500 --> 27:18.416
"When she finally does explode,

27:18.500 --> 27:21.083
we should be able to use it
to our advantage."

27:21.166 --> 27:22.541
You did write that?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.208
Yes. Yes, I did, but--

27:26.291 --> 27:28.583
I think it's fair to say she has exploded.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.625
Now, if there's nothing else--

27:34.708 --> 27:36.333
May I say something?

27:44.041 --> 27:47.125
Stella is right in her assessment
of what happened that night.

27:47.208 --> 27:50.458
It was self-defense. Rosalind attacked me
and I defended myself.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.333
She's also right in her letter.

27:55.291 --> 27:57.000
Because of what happened next.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.666
During our standoff,

28:00.875 --> 28:04.708
there was a moment
where I could have let go and I didn't.

28:06.791 --> 28:09.416
<i> Something took over</i>
<i>and I wanted to hurt her.</i>

28:10.541 --> 28:13.083
I wanted to punish Rosalind
for killing Miss Dowling.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.958
<i>And in that moment, I wanted her dead.</i>

28:19.666 --> 28:22.166
The Dragon Flame gave me the ability
to make it happen.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.458
I will accept the consequences
to my actions.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.958
And I appreciate your candor.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.083
However,

28:42.291 --> 28:43.625
it doesn't change the fact

28:43.708 --> 28:46.291
that you are still
a great threat to the realm.

28:49.541 --> 28:51.958
My ruling is to place you in stasis.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.958
To be re-evaluated after 20 years.

28:57.041 --> 28:59.083
Wait. What?

28:59.791 --> 29:01.000
Take her to the sanctum.

29:01.625 --> 29:02.625
No, Mum, you can't.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.333
Do not make this difficult.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.625
You don't have to.

29:07.708 --> 29:08.791
It's okay.

29:12.416 --> 29:13.333
It's for the best.

29:56.666 --> 30:00.500
I'm sorry you never had
a fairy mother who could understand you,

30:00.583 --> 30:02.708
who could teach you to control your magic.

30:05.375 --> 30:06.375
Me too.

30:23.875 --> 30:25.875
You know when I wrote you that letter--

30:25.958 --> 30:28.875
You were trying to get back
into my good graces. Obviously.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.041
And while it was transparent and a…

30:35.291 --> 30:36.500
little clumsy,

30:36.583 --> 30:38.291
it was a savvy move.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.541
My good graces are where you ought to be.

30:42.416 --> 30:43.916
You are the princess.

30:45.083 --> 30:47.625
Was there any chance
you were going to let her go today?

30:49.083 --> 30:49.916
No.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.875
But I was impressed
by how you comported yourself.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.875
Gracious yet firm.

30:59.541 --> 31:01.333
I was very proud of you.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.083
Take off your jacket.

31:09.750 --> 31:10.750
Turn round.

31:29.208 --> 31:30.791
So, that's all I had to do?

31:32.041 --> 31:34.416
Just play your game.

31:36.541 --> 31:38.666
It's not my game, Stella.

31:43.916 --> 31:45.000
But yes.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.666
We both must play it.

31:52.875 --> 31:55.708
And I am sorry about your friend.

31:59.291 --> 32:03.000
But being a queen means you must look
beyond things like friendships.

32:06.083 --> 32:09.250
One day, you'll understand that.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.541
What if I don't want to?

32:12.625 --> 32:14.875
I'm afraid you have no choice.

32:16.208 --> 32:19.583
What about if I'm not the princess?
Do I have a choice then?

32:20.250 --> 32:24.041
You be careful, Stella.
You don't know what you're saying.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.250
Yes, I do.

32:29.208 --> 32:32.541
If I am forced to choose
between my friends and my privilege,

32:33.458 --> 32:35.416
do not be surprised by what wins.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.041
What happened with Bloom?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.083
Aisha?

32:56.375 --> 32:57.208
Are you okay?

33:02.333 --> 33:03.333
<i>Hi.</i>

33:04.375 --> 33:05.208
<i>I, uh…</i>

33:07.375 --> 33:08.708
owe you an explanation.

33:09.416 --> 33:11.041
No, just an answer.

33:12.750 --> 33:13.958
Are you a Blood Witch?

33:19.208 --> 33:21.625
I'm sorry, Aisha.
I knew you wouldn't understand.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.333
It's over.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.625
-No…
-I'm sorry. She's gone.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.041
No…

33:48.083 --> 33:50.166
It's fine. Hey. It's okay.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.291
-It's okay.

33:52.916 --> 33:54.666
-It'll be okay.

33:56.750 --> 33:59.208
You know, at first glance,

33:59.875 --> 34:02.000
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is a great story.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.625
Tragic love at its finest.

34:06.666 --> 34:07.833
Then you realize

34:09.208 --> 34:10.291
Juliet's 13,

34:11.208 --> 34:12.125
Romeo's a dick,

34:12.625 --> 34:16.583
and the whole mess could've been avoided
with just a little more communication.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.916
Counter counterpoint. Leo and Claire.

34:20.791 --> 34:21.875
Hard to top that.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.916
Is this the right thing to do?

34:27.083 --> 34:30.875
I know I'm meant to hate fairies,
but now that Rosalind's gone,

34:32.416 --> 34:34.250
maybe we can find another way.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.166
-Didn't you hear Luna's address?
-No. I was on my way here. Why?

34:43.708 --> 34:45.166
They blamed us, Grey.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.041
What?

34:47.583 --> 34:50.208
Your girlfriend's roommate
killed Rosalind,

34:51.125 --> 34:52.083
and they blamed us.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.041
So if there was anyone left in Solaria

34:55.125 --> 34:57.250
who didn't hate Blood Witches,
they do now.

34:57.833 --> 35:01.500
Fairies want us dead, okay?

35:03.416 --> 35:05.125
They have always wanted us dead.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.250
Now it's time to fight back.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.666
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

35:19.750 --> 35:23.166
-Can't we appeal the ruling?
-Mum has sole discretion in her ruling.

35:23.250 --> 35:26.041
Once she makes up her mind,
it literally becomes law.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.500
-Go back to her. Change her mind.
-Yeah, that doesn't really happen.

35:29.583 --> 35:32.291
What about the crystal?
It has fragments of the Dragon Flame.

35:32.375 --> 35:33.916
Maybe we can use that to break her out?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.750
Or if we get a message to Bloom,
then she can break herself out?

35:37.833 --> 35:40.166
That sounds like her, right? You know her.

35:40.250 --> 35:43.166
-I thought I did, but…
-You didn't see her in there, Flora.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.625
-Bloom's given up.
-That doesn't mean we have to.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.791
Bloom is scared. So are we all.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.166
But I refuse to live in fear.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.708
As long as one person has hope,
maybe there's a chance.

35:55.791 --> 35:57.541
Read the room, Flora. It's over.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.416
-He didn't give you any details?
-No, just a text to gear up.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.083
We need to move quickly.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.916
The Solarians found Sebastian's hideout.
A few hours from here.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.541
Bavani doesn't trust the army
to make a covert move.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.833
-She does, however, trust us.
-We're attacking?

36:15.916 --> 36:19.291
Yeah. You were saying you wanted combat.
Congratulations. You've got it.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.958
Our job is to take them out.
End this war before it begins, okay? Move.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.958
-Sky.
-Hey, sorry.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.000
I got your text. Give me one second.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.000
Whoa. Are you sure you wanna come?

36:30.083 --> 36:31.791
-Yeah, 100%.
-Right.

36:31.875 --> 36:34.833
I've been sitting around
waiting to hear about the tribunal.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.208
-This is a much better use of my time.
-Sky.

36:39.708 --> 36:40.708
What? What is it?

36:40.791 --> 36:42.541
Queen Luna made her ruling.

36:45.583 --> 36:48.083
Let me see her.
You have to let me see her.

36:51.416 --> 36:52.416
Get him to a cell.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.583
Let me go. Bloom! Bloom!

36:56.416 --> 36:58.458
Bloom! Bloom!

37:03.416 --> 37:04.708
Really guys? You too?

37:43.916 --> 37:45.916
Aisha, could you come here for a second?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.291
You still have
the Convergence Crystal, right?

37:59.958 --> 38:01.125
What're you cooking up?

38:07.125 --> 38:10.083
We thought this thing was dead
when we found it at the graveyard.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.666
It wasn't dead at all.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.833
<i>Bloom's felt different</i>
<i>her entire life.</i>

38:38.375 --> 38:40.833
<i>She had no one to teach and support her.</i>

38:53.083 --> 38:54.791
<i>We take that for granted.</i>

39:04.500 --> 39:06.666
<i>That we grow up knowing who we are.</i>

39:19.000 --> 39:21.125
<i> That our fairy mothers</i>
<i>will guide us.</i>

39:50.791 --> 39:51.916
Miss Dowling?

39:53.083 --> 39:54.083
Hello, Bloom.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.958
We couldn't believe it either.
It's all thanks to Flora.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.791
I couldn't figure out why the compound
wasn't working at the graveyard.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.000
Then I saw my plants wilting,
and it clicked.

40:10.916 --> 40:14.250
This little guy was absorbing
every piece of life essence he could.

40:14.333 --> 40:16.583
In the First World,
they're called resurrection plants.

40:16.666 --> 40:18.458
They're like
nature's time capsules.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.500
Could do with a bit more color,
but I suppose, form over function.

40:23.291 --> 40:26.333
We fed it the last of the Dragon Flame
from the Convergence Crystal,

40:26.416 --> 40:27.583
and it opened up.

40:28.791 --> 40:29.958
You were in there?

40:30.041 --> 40:31.125
My spirit was, yes.

40:31.208 --> 40:32.708
That's super weird, right?

40:33.291 --> 40:35.541
When I realized
what Rosalind was going to do,

40:35.625 --> 40:37.833
I drew on as much magic as I could.

40:37.916 --> 40:40.541
and called on the natural world
to preserve me.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.416
I owed you all one last goodbye.

40:45.541 --> 40:46.875
Life is precious,

40:48.708 --> 40:49.750
but so is death.

40:50.833 --> 40:52.458
Both must be respected.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.291
I did not survive Rosalind's attack.

40:57.875 --> 41:00.083
So I can't help you fight
the battle ahead.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.541
But I do have time for one final lesson.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.583
Magic lessons aren't really
my thing anymore.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.291
So maybe I should go and guard the door.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.833
You're all fairies.
This lesson is for all of you.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.541
It's about transformation magic.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.750
When I was your headmistress,
I shielded you

41:21.833 --> 41:23.583
from the harsh truths of the world.

41:24.750 --> 41:30.208
I believed that positive emotions
were the cornerstone of powerful magic.

41:31.291 --> 41:32.708
Rosalind felt the opposite.

41:33.666 --> 41:36.458
That strength was only forged
in those harsh truths.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.708
We were both wrong.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.666
To unlock true magic,

41:44.583 --> 41:47.458
you must make peace
with all your emotions.

41:47.541 --> 41:50.916
The reckless joy of the positive
and the despair of the negative.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.791
There is beauty and power in both.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.291
I'm so proud of each of you.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.541
And of the women you're becoming.

42:06.250 --> 42:07.791
Bloom, shall we take a walk?

42:12.791 --> 42:16.000
I don't care what it takes.
We have to find her.

42:17.791 --> 42:19.291
Not a word of this to anyone.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.791
-Bavani knows that Bloom's gone.
-According to who? Beatrix?

42:35.875 --> 42:36.875
And we believe her?

42:37.875 --> 42:40.125
Look, she's trying, okay? Just…

42:41.333 --> 42:44.750
She'll check our room.
It'll look suspicious if we're all gone.

42:44.833 --> 42:48.166
I'll go back. You guys need more time
with Miss Dowling.

42:48.250 --> 42:50.291
I don't have the same connection to her.

42:51.208 --> 42:53.333
-Thank you.
-I'm coming too.

42:53.416 --> 42:56.666
It's more believable if I'm there.
Give her one last hug from me.

43:08.833 --> 43:10.583
Three entrance points. Three teams.

43:10.666 --> 43:13.250
Take out as many as you can
before they know we're here.

43:15.166 --> 43:18.166
LeRoy only had time
to make protection for this group,

43:18.250 --> 43:19.916
so their curses won't work on us.

43:20.708 --> 43:21.791
But make no mistake,

43:21.875 --> 43:24.625
once we kick this hornet's nest,
the war begins,

43:24.708 --> 43:27.500
so if anyone wants out,
there's no shame in that.

43:32.708 --> 43:33.708
Let's do this.

43:36.583 --> 43:38.333
Are you disappointed in me?

43:39.625 --> 43:40.958
For losing control. For…

43:43.791 --> 43:45.041
killing somebody.

43:45.875 --> 43:47.583
Taking a life is serious.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.458
You'll carry that burden forever.

43:56.458 --> 43:58.375
But nothing happens in a vacuum.

44:02.291 --> 44:05.791
When we discovered
what Rosalind had done at Aster Dell,

44:05.875 --> 44:07.541
I was so angry I…

44:10.916 --> 44:12.333
I wanted to kill her.

44:13.291 --> 44:16.458
If I had the power you have,
things may have turned out differently.

44:21.791 --> 44:24.750
The world is a better place
without Rosalind Hale.

44:25.875 --> 44:27.333
That's an objective truth.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.750
What's done is done.

44:32.375 --> 44:35.458
But it's not done
because I still have this thing inside me.

44:39.583 --> 44:41.833
The more I learn about it,
the more it scares me.

44:41.916 --> 44:43.291
I'm sure it does.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.958
-But you have to use it.

44:50.041 --> 44:51.541
One way or another.

44:52.625 --> 44:53.875
You can't give up.

44:56.625 --> 44:57.833
You have to fight.

45:00.333 --> 45:03.208
But how do I do that?
How do I… How do I…

45:04.375 --> 45:06.416
How do I do that without losing control?

45:07.833 --> 45:10.125
I just want somebody
to tell me what to do.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.791
I can't do that, Bloom.

45:13.750 --> 45:14.916
Nobody can.

45:18.541 --> 45:20.458
That's the hardest lesson of all.

45:23.208 --> 45:24.708
All I can tell you

45:27.041 --> 45:28.541
is that I believe in you.

45:30.916 --> 45:34.250
And you must know
that anything with the power to destroy

45:34.333 --> 45:35.583
can also protect.

45:36.791 --> 45:41.083
You, Bloom, have the power
to save the world.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.500
You've heard that before.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.875
Rosalind proclaimed it
at the alumni banquet.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.291
With her by your side, no doubt.

45:56.833 --> 45:57.833
Yeah.

45:58.625 --> 46:00.583
It's a very Rosalind thing to do.

46:01.833 --> 46:03.291
Then let me amend it.

46:05.125 --> 46:07.000
Don't think about saving the world.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.458
Think about saving your world.

46:11.916 --> 46:14.375
The people you love,
the people you care about.

46:17.125 --> 46:18.916
If you use your power for that…

46:22.000 --> 46:23.375
you can never go wrong.

46:42.583 --> 46:43.875
It's almost time.

46:46.333 --> 46:47.791
Maybe just a hug?

46:50.333 --> 46:51.583
For old time's sake?

47:30.083 --> 47:32.000
Looks like you were right with Musa.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.541
Here we are, 12 hours later, in the shit.

47:35.041 --> 47:38.875
Don't do anything stupid in there, okay?
Don't wanna carry your ass anywhere.

47:38.958 --> 47:42.791
Don't know if you even could.
Your lower body needs a lot of work.

48:27.583 --> 48:29.000
They knew we were coming.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.458
Took you long enough.

48:51.083 --> 48:52.458
It's the entourage.

48:53.708 --> 48:55.375
Like herding cats.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.666
Could you cut the lights?

49:05.166 --> 49:06.375
All of them, please.

49:07.583 --> 49:08.666
Of course.
