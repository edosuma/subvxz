00:08.333 --> 00:11.367

in my head.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.300
>> My breasts look like
collapsed craters.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.700

Witch of the West.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.734

Is she a cartoon character?

00:17.734 --> 00:20.200
Is she a Martian?
Is she a piece of fruit?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.567
What is she? I don't know.
>> male announcer: "Botched"

00:22.567 --> 00:25.033
is back.
>> So I have had three

00:25.033 --> 00:26.700
rhinoplasties.
>> We just saw you less than

00:26.700 --> 00:29.100
a year ago.
>> You are going to have

00:29.100 --> 00:33.300
a breast disaster.
>> I told him, "Get rid of

00:33.300 --> 00:36.066
the hump," and he said,
"You should get a chin implant."

00:36.066 --> 00:37.700
>> I became obsessed
with lip injection.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.533
>> Was it a board-certified
plastic surgeon?

00:39.533 --> 00:41.633
>> No.
>> This is the largest

00:41.633 --> 00:44.000

00:44.000 --> 00:45.667
You do not love food
more than this guy.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.734
>> I can tell.
>> You're saying I'm fat?

00:47.734 --> 00:49.767
>> [laughing]
>> And the doctor said,

00:49.767 --> 00:51.600
"I will saw your cheekbone."
>> Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa,

At age 14?

00:53.233 --> 00:56.100

01:00.633 --> 01:02.767

toppling over?
>> announcer: Doctors Dubrow

01:04.667 --> 01:07.767
and Nassif make impossible
surgeries possible.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.767
>> I've been to 50 consults.
>> And you've gotten turned down

01:10.767 --> 01:13.200
by all the doctors?
>> Every single doctor.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.233
>> You know, there's limitations
of what the scalpel can do.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.200
Oh, my God.
>> I know. And look.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.367
>> Necrosis to--oh!
I'm actually getting nauseated,

01:21.367 --> 01:24.367
it's so bad.
>> There is no instruction book

01:24.367 --> 01:26.266
as to how to do this.
>> All I saw was,

01:26.266 --> 01:28.567
"Danger, danger."
>> This silicone implant

01:28.567 --> 01:31.667
is totally destroyed.
>> As I'm looking at what should

01:31.667 --> 01:33.367
be normal anatomy,
it's not there.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.033
It's gone.
>> Would you come wipe the blood

01:35.033 --> 01:37.767
off my glasses?
This is as hard as it comes.

01:37.767 --> 01:40.400
Having said that, this is
what we live for.

>> [grunts]

01:49.367 --> 01:51.633
Yeah, let's not try that.

I have the biggest boobs in
Europe, but I need my butt to

02:14.000 --> 02:17.300
match my boobs.
I grew up in Germany.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.333
When I was a little girl,
I was really shy.

02:20.333 --> 02:26.467
Even my teachers said,
"You need to get more friends."

02:26.467 --> 02:30.300
I can remember I started
thinking, "Oh, you should be

02:30.300 --> 02:34.033
like Barbie," when I was 11.
I love Barbie because of her

02:34.033 --> 02:38.533
long wavy blonde hairs, nice
curves, the full lips, the small

02:38.533 --> 02:45.700
waist, the long legs, but the--
After high school,

02:45.700 --> 02:49.333
I was a flight attendant.
Flight attendants can have

02:49.333 --> 02:53.467
breast surgery, but they must be
very small.

02:53.467 --> 02:59.500
So I quit.
In 2012, I changed my body from

02:59.500 --> 03:02.600
head to toe.
There the life begin.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.433
We had the rhinoplasty to
slender the nose.

03:05.433 --> 03:11.333
I got porcelain veneers to get
longer teeths for bright smile.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.700
This is my first implant set.
I started with 32D.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.100
There's a port and there's a
tube, and here's, like, a water

03:19.100 --> 03:23.600
balloon inside.
And I have pumped up my boobs

03:23.600 --> 03:28.600
18 times with saline.
This is now 3,700 cc,

03:28.600 --> 03:33.734
about nine pounds each.
But because I had a liposuction

03:33.734 --> 03:44.600
to get long legs, my butt is
a little bit too flat.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.066
...to grow bigger, bigger, and
bigger.

03:47.066 --> 03:50.233

>> My name is Flame Monroe.
I am 30-plus years of age, and

03:57.633 --> 04:01.333
these boobs have got to go.
I was born Marcus Parker, but

04:01.333 --> 04:04.333
everybody affectionately called
me Sissy Marcus, because I was

04:04.333 --> 04:07.133
very flamboyant and happy with
who I was.

04:07.133 --> 04:10.367
I knew who I was, and there was
no shame, because my grandmother

04:10.367 --> 04:12.767
didn't raise me like that.
It is important for some people

04:12.767 --> 04:15.400
to have he or she labels, but
Flame just works for me,

04:15.400 --> 04:18.400
because I know who I am.
After I got out of high school,

04:18.400 --> 04:20.767
I went to a club in Chicago
called the Baton, and I saw the

04:20.767 --> 04:23.567
female impersonators, and, oh,
my God.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.667
They were beautiful and
glamorous, and sexy, and

04:26.667 --> 04:28.667
gorgeous.
And they would have guest spots

04:28.667 --> 04:30.633
on Sunday night, so I went for
the first time.

04:30.633 --> 04:34.100
And the lights hit me, and the
audience loved me, and I think I

04:34.100 --> 04:36.667
made $2 in tips, but it was not
even about the money.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.633
It was about the screams and the
applause, and Flame Monroe was

04:39.633 --> 04:42.233
born.
In the midst of my performing,

04:42.233 --> 04:45.300
I realized I wanted to make some
changes to my look and my

04:45.300 --> 04:48.033
appearance, because I wanted to
wear bustier dresses, and I

04:48.033 --> 04:49.567
didn't want them to lay on my
chest.

04:49.567 --> 04:53.000
So I got my first set of breast
implants in Mexico.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.266
And those were okay.
And I kept those for about six

04:55.266 --> 04:57.667
years, and then I went to
a doctor on Michigan Avenue who

04:57.667 --> 05:01.433
did a fantastic job.
I had saline, a C-cup.

05:01.433 --> 05:04.467
I thought they were perfect.
But I had one girl who was very

05:04.467 --> 05:07.333
close to me say, "I think you
need bigger boobs, Flame."

05:07.333 --> 05:11.700
Went to another part of Mexico,
and went downhill from there.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.266
This third set, it caught
an infection, and lost

05:14.266 --> 05:17.300
the right one for eight weeks.
Then I had to let my body heal,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.333
and I went back and got them
done again.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.133
I think they must have put some
burritos, or some tacos, or some

05:22.133 --> 05:24.533
taquitos up in my chest or
something, because one is

05:24.533 --> 05:28.266
bothering me, like, pain, and
the other one is just dangling.

05:28.266 --> 05:31.233
I've only wanted to add on.
I want added-on breasts.

05:31.233 --> 05:34.066
I added on the hips and the
butt, but I've never removed

05:34.066 --> 05:35.700
anything.
We like our parts.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.033
We like what God gave us.
We're very happy.

05:40.033 --> 05:43.567
I love women, especially very
masculine lesbian women.

05:43.567 --> 05:49.166
And I did fall in love in 2002.
We have three kids that are

05:49.166 --> 05:54.367
really special people, but we
were not compatible, and thank

05:54.367 --> 05:56.567
you, State of California, 'cause
they gave me sole custody.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.367
I take care of my kids on my
own.

05:58.367 --> 06:02.567
My son, Jamarcus, is 13.
My daughter, Isabella, is 12.

06:02.567 --> 06:05.467
And my baby girl, Iseriah, is
nine.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.734
My children are the most amazing
people in the world.

06:07.734 --> 06:11.567
They are happy.
They keep me grounded, and they

06:11.567 --> 06:14.266
love me.
As strange looking as I am to

06:14.266 --> 06:18.100
some people and as outlandish
as I can be, my children don't

06:18.100 --> 06:20.367
see that.
All they see is Dad.

06:20.367 --> 06:23.200
Now it's time to get my breasts
fixed, because I'm afraid that

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
something's gonna go wrong,
and then who's gonna raise my

06:25.200 --> 06:27.000
children?
So I just want to get them

06:27.000 --> 06:32.066
repaired correctively and be
whole again.

06:32.066 --> 06:35.200
>> This next patient's name is
Flame.

06:35.200 --> 06:41.600
Flame is a gentleman who lives
both as a male and as a female.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.266
Just a few years ago, it was
considered bad practice to give

06:45.266 --> 06:49.333
a male female breast implants.
But because things have really

06:49.333 --> 06:53.700
changed now in society,
it's very acceptable to consider

06:53.700 --> 06:56.367
doing that under the right
circumstances.

06:56.367 --> 06:59.400
She currently has breast
implants that are actually quite

06:59.400 --> 07:01.567
old, and has superior
displacement.

07:01.567 --> 07:06.367
There must an encapsulation.
Obviously has large scars, and

07:06.367 --> 07:10.367
has the very-difficult-to-fix
double-bubble deformity.

07:10.367 --> 07:14.233
Why don't we bring her in--
>> So we're gonna say "her"?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.567
>> I don't know what her
preference is.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.567
Why don't you bring Flame in,
and we'll ask her.

07:19.567 --> 07:24.166
>> Can you please send in Flame?
>> Flame.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.667
>> Good morning.
>> Hi. Doctor Nassif.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.266
>> Nice to meet you.
How are you?

07:27.266 --> 07:28.700
>> Terry Dubrow.
Pleasure to meet you.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.367
>> Please, have a seat.
>> Thank you.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.100
It's overwhelming to know that,
after 14 years, somebody's gonna

07:33.100 --> 07:37.000
really take a serious look on
what they're gonna do with these

07:37.000 --> 07:39.567
boobs of mine.
So I'm a little apprehensive

07:39.567 --> 07:42.000
about it, but I'm excited at
the same time.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.266
>> Could you give us a little
sort of synopsis of your

07:45.266 --> 07:47.166
situation?
We know you've had some breast

07:47.166 --> 07:48.533
surgery, right?
>> Yes.

07:48.533 --> 07:51.400
>> But you live as a man, but
you work as a woman, correct?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.567
>> Yes.
I am a stand-up comedian by

07:53.567 --> 07:55.533
profession and a female
impersonator.

07:55.533 --> 07:58.200
And performing, to me, was more
important than anything until I

07:58.200 --> 08:03.000
became a dad.
>> Flame Monroe is a dad by day

08:03.000 --> 08:06.266
and a drag queen by night to
support his three kids.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.166
Okay.
I can understand that.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.133
That's respectable.
>> You don't consider yourself

08:10.133 --> 08:13.200
in a transgender mode, right?
>> I do consider myself

08:13.200 --> 08:16.467
transgender, but just not with
the whole hoopla-ha behind it,

08:16.467 --> 08:19.700
because I'm Dad to my children.
I'm Mister Flame to their

08:19.700 --> 08:22.500
friends.
>> Okay, so we respect that.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.166
>> So I never took anything off
from my anatomy.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.066
I only added on.
>> Okay.

08:27.066 --> 08:29.700
>> He and she labels mean
absolutely nothing.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.066
Flame is everything.
Flame is the provider,

08:32.066 --> 08:34.367
the moneymaker, the mom,
the dad, the brother,

08:34.367 --> 08:37.467
the sister, the friend,
the provider, the entertainer,

08:37.467 --> 08:39.467
the comedian.
Everything.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.033
>> So you got breast implant
surgery at what age?

08:42.033 --> 08:44.300
>> My first breast implants were
22.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.567
I went to Mexico.
It was a backyard, bootleg--

08:47.567 --> 08:49.300
but they were great.
It was a B set.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.300
They were good.
Then I went to Chicago, where

08:52.300 --> 08:57.033
I'm from, and had a C cup done.
Saline, great doctor, perfect

08:57.033 --> 09:00.000
breasts.
Listened to another queen,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.533
I had to have bigger breasts.
I should have kept those,

09:02.533 --> 09:05.600
'cause they were perfect.
Went back to another part of

09:05.600 --> 09:10.500
Mexico, I got an infection.
So for 8 weeks, I got really

09:10.500 --> 09:12.233
ill, really sick--
>> Okay.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.233
Did they have to come out?
>> Yeah, they had to take them

09:14.233 --> 09:17.467
both out.
>> Okay, so we need to go in,

09:17.467 --> 09:21.633
look and figure it out.
All right? Okay.

09:21.633 --> 09:24.066
>> Heading to exam, I am a
little nervous.

09:24.066 --> 09:26.633
It's been a while since I've
exposed my naked breasts to

09:26.633 --> 09:30.333
anyone.
I never let anyone see

09:30.333 --> 09:32.633
the deformity of my breasts.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.100
>> We went back to the original
surgeon and he said, "No, your

09:39.100 --> 09:41.700
nose is fine.
You should get a chin implant."

09:41.700 --> 09:43.400
>> Well, that's gonna really
help your breathing.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.266
>> Yeah, exactly.
>> I don't know what that doctor

09:45.266 --> 09:47.100
was thinking.
>> Now I can see my curves,

09:47.100 --> 09:50.100
yeah.
Good?

09:50.100 --> 09:53.767
>> Yes.
>> This is a really extreme

09:53.767 --> 09:57.133
curve look.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.000
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

10:06.367 --> 10:09.133
>> All right, let me focus on
your chest for a minute.

10:09.133 --> 10:13.166
>> Flame, his implants have been
in there for 14 years.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.667
Terry has to identify what's
going on here.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.133
>> Okay, I'm gonna give you
a little squeeze.

10:19.133 --> 10:21.667
So they're encapsulated,
but they're sort of a soft

10:21.667 --> 10:25.133
encapsulation.
So these are pretty significant

10:25.133 --> 10:29.066
darkened scars that you have
down here, and you have what we

10:29.066 --> 10:31.700
call a double-bubble deformity
right here, where it goes,

10:31.700 --> 10:36.166
"bloop, bloop."
So this one may require a

10:36.166 --> 10:39.433
procedure that involves scarring
around the areola.

10:39.433 --> 10:42.467
How do you feel about that?
>> I'm good with that.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.166
>> You're okay with that?
>> I'm okay with that.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.033

11:52.533 --> 11:55.233
>> My name is Pardis, and there
is nothing normal about this

11:55.233 --> 11:58.600
bottomless beak.
It's really crooked, bumpy, and

11:58.600 --> 12:03.233
my nostrils are different sizes.
My nose--growing up, I'd say

12:03.233 --> 12:06.633
first, second, third grade,
was still kind of normal.

12:06.633 --> 12:10.633
It was about fourth, fifth grade
when I actually started noticing

12:10.633 --> 12:14.066
the change in my nose.
You know, I had the big beak,

12:14.066 --> 12:16.600
just the traditional,
Middle Eastern nose, and that

12:16.600 --> 12:19.734
was when kids actually started
to tease me, and that's when,

12:19.734 --> 12:22.533
like, my self-confidence really
started to go down.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.200
In the Middle Eastern community,
but also the Persian community,

12:25.200 --> 12:29.000
people get their nose fixed.
So when I was 15, I finally

12:29.000 --> 12:32.233
decided to get it fixed.
My biggest fear of getting

12:32.233 --> 12:36.000
the nose job was going into my
sophomore year and having kids

12:36.000 --> 12:41.133
notice, so I told him just to
get rid of the hump.

12:41.133 --> 12:45.166
Whereas my mom said, "No, do
the whole thing."

12:45.166 --> 12:49.166
The doctor listened to me,
and he just took away the hump.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.633
As soon as he took the bandage
off, I was really happy with my

12:51.633 --> 12:54.400
nose.
I went back to school, and

12:54.400 --> 12:57.667
everything, like, that I had
wanted, it started happening for

12:57.667 --> 13:00.266
me, finally.
I had more confidence.

13:00.266 --> 13:04.567
I had my first boyfriend, and my
life kind of changed afterwards

13:04.567 --> 13:07.667
for the better.
But in my mid-20s, my nose

13:07.667 --> 13:11.133
started to look more crooked.
My breathing started to get

13:11.133 --> 13:14.033
a lot worse.
I started snoring.

13:14.033 --> 13:18.333
It started hanging down a little
more than it did before.

13:18.333 --> 13:22.033
We went back to the original
surgeon, and he said, "No, your

13:22.033 --> 13:25.300
nose is fine.
You should get a chin implant."

13:25.300 --> 13:28.133
So that started a whole new
self-confidence thing.

13:28.133 --> 13:31.266
Now I notice my chin, but maybe
it's that he didn't want to go

13:31.266 --> 13:34.400
back in and have to fix it.
In my day to day life,

13:34.400 --> 13:39.200
I struggle with breathing,
sense of smell, taste buds.

I hit puberty.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.433
The hump came in.
Just that traditional

14:25.433 --> 14:29.166
Middle Eastern hump, and my
parents were like, "Look, if you

14:29.166 --> 14:33.600

I was so concerned over going

14:33.600 --> 14:36.667

everybody know that I had a nose

of the hump."

And he did.
>> The problem with just

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
removing Pardis' hump is that it
will, in fact, make her nose

14:47.200 --> 14:50.600
look longer.
So although the surgeon wanted

14:50.600 --> 14:55.066
to please her, he actually
traded one problem for another.

14:55.066 --> 14:58.467

it has to do with my surgery."
>> Yeah.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.233

actually, I'm able to breathe

15:49.000 --> 15:50.633

15:50.633 --> 15:52.500

15:52.500 --> 15:54.633
we'll take a peek at your nose.
>> All right, thank you.

15:54.633 --> 15:57.333
>> You know, when Pardis tells
me that she has to use her hand

15:57.333 --> 16:00.667
to open up her airway by pulling
at her cheek, that's a classic

16:00.667 --> 16:02.467
sign that she has nasal
obstruction.

16:02.467 --> 16:05.266

her in the exam room and check

16:05.266 --> 16:08.400

problem.

Let's have you take a peek.
See, here's your deviated

16:30.266 --> 16:32.000
septum.
>> Oh, wow.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.133
I'm really shocked seeing my
deviated septum for the first

16:35.133 --> 16:36.734
time.
I didn't think you could

16:36.734 --> 16:39.333
actually see it in a mirror.
>> The doctor took down the

16:39.333 --> 16:43.200
hump, but when you take too much
bone down, you get down

16:43.200 --> 16:45.633
to cartilage.
When you file down

16:45.633 --> 16:48.033
the nasal hump, you're left with
a gap in the nasal bones.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.233
And to correct this, you have to
fracture the bones.

16:50.233 --> 16:54.100
What Pardis' surgeon forgot to
do is fracture the nasal bones.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.600
So now she's left with a gap,
and that is called an open roof

16:57.600 --> 16:59.233
deformity.
So you have to fracture those

16:59.233 --> 17:00.500
bones.
>> Okay.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.433
>> We have to open up the scar
again, do another open

17:02.433 --> 17:05.333
rhinoplasty.
Also, put a piece of cartilage

17:05.333 --> 17:07.600
called a spreader graft along
the right side.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.166
Hopefully you have a good amount
of cartilage in there.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.200
>> Okay.
I'm definitely scared.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.700

hopefully without making any

22:12.734 --> 22:15.333
the left breast.
The left breast is encapsulated,

22:15.333 --> 22:20.734
and so the chance that this has
ruptured is very, very high.

22:20.734 --> 22:23.633
Yeah.
This one's ruptured.

22:23.633 --> 22:28.700
It's like a silicone explosion.
So this silicone implant is

22:28.700 --> 22:34.233
totally destroyed.
Whenever you have an unexpected

22:34.233 --> 22:38.567
ruptured implant found in
surgery, it's very difficult to

22:38.567 --> 22:40.734
take all of the ruptured
contents out.

22:40.734 --> 22:46.200
In addition, it's kind of sticky
in the entire operating room.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.567
My God.
A silicone bomb.

22:50.567 --> 22:53.767
>> One of the worst I've ever
seen you do.

22:53.767 --> 22:56.667
>> The chances that it could go
on to scar tissue formation,

22:56.667 --> 23:00.533
infection, extrusion, and even
worse is actually significantly

23:00.533 --> 23:02.600
higher.
So we need to take this out

23:02.600 --> 23:06.467
entirely and really get a good
cleaning of the area.

23:06.467 --> 23:10.467
The capsule has a lot of
silicone in it, so it's helpful

23:10.467 --> 23:15.333
to get all the capsule out.
Now that I've taken the capsule

23:15.333 --> 23:19.200
out of Flame's breast, I have to
irrigate it out very carefully,

23:19.200 --> 23:22.734
because if I leave any loose
silicone left in the pocket,

23:22.734 --> 23:25.533
it could potentially be very
dangerous to her.

23:25.533 --> 23:27.633
This is a much better implant to
put in.

23:27.633 --> 23:34.266
This is what Flame wanted,
a wider look that will hopefully

23:34.266 --> 23:40.000
fill out the envelope of the
breast.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.233
Now that I've put two new
implants in, I have to very

23:44.233 --> 23:47.767
carefully make sure she's
symmetrical, so that she has the

23:47.767 --> 23:50.633
best breasts she can on the
stage.

23:50.633 --> 23:57.567
I wonder if I can resize this.
Here, Heidi, hold this for

23:57.567 --> 24:00.166
a second.
We'll do a segmental

24:00.166 --> 24:03.767
capsulectomy.
A segmental capsulectomy is

24:03.767 --> 24:07.633
where you remove segments of
the scar tissue and open up

24:07.633 --> 24:11.367
the pocket in that area where
the scar tissue has scarred it

24:11.367 --> 24:15.533
down and have made that area not
very round.

24:15.533 --> 24:18.033
My God, look at that, Heidi.
That totally worked.

24:18.033 --> 24:22.700
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, so this is a real

24:22.700 --> 24:25.033
home run, actually.
>> Yeah, agreed.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.033
>> Thank you.
Appreciate it.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.567
With Flame there were some
surprises that I didn't expect,

24:29.567 --> 24:32.266
but also some really positive
surprises.

24:32.266 --> 24:36.133
I was able to fill out the right
skin laxity without doing

24:36.133 --> 24:41.533
a lift, so no new scars.
>> She's got a pretty bad

24:41.533 --> 24:43.533
deviated septum.
>> It's severe.

24:43.533 --> 24:46.667

complete left airway.

almost the same hair coloring.

>> Hi.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.700

I'm checking in for my surgery.

>> Yes.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.300
Keep thinking, "What did I get
myself into?"

25:17.300 --> 25:18.567
Okay.
>> All right.

25:18.567 --> 25:21.033
>> Love you, baby.
>> But I know in the end,

25:21.033 --> 25:23.567
you know, it's all gonna be a
distant memory, and, you know,

25:23.567 --> 25:26.467
a little discomfort and pain.
It's gonna be so worth it.

25:26.467 --> 25:29.734
Will someone let my family know
that, like, we're starting and--

25:29.734 --> 25:31.767
>> Yes.
We will absolutely do that.

25:31.767 --> 25:33.600
Yeah.
>> When I look at Pardis' nose,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.500
the things that I see that's
irregular, it's more around

25:35.500 --> 25:38.033
the tip.
I see that the tip is hanging.

25:38.033 --> 25:40.100
I see the tip is also
over-projected.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.200
The nostrils are pulled up.
My goal is to soften up that

25:43.200 --> 25:45.767
area to make it look more
natural, fix the deviated

25:45.767 --> 25:50.000
septum, and also to make the
middle part of the nose

25:50.000 --> 25:52.600
symmetric, since right now
it's collapsing on one side.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.667
For Pardis' surgery today, I'll
begin by harvesting cartilage

25:55.667 --> 25:59.000
from her ear and opening up her
nose for the deconstruction.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Then I'll fracture the nasal
bones, bringing them in to fix

26:02.000 --> 26:04.633
her open roof deformity.
After that, I'll perform a

26:04.633 --> 26:07.767
septoplasty and turbinoplasty,
opening her airway and

26:07.767 --> 26:11.100
straightening her septum.
Lastly, I'll place grafts from

26:11.100 --> 26:15.133
her ear and possibly her rib
into the nib portion and tip of

26:15.133 --> 26:18.600
the nose, decreasing the
projection off her face, lifting

26:18.600 --> 26:21.400
the columella and improving her
symmetry.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.633
Medium skin hook.
We're starting the rhinoplasty

26:23.633 --> 26:26.400
now.
>> Careful.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.100
>> Really thin skin over the
dorsum.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.100
Got really thin skin over the
tip.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.433
Pardis has thin nasal-tip skin,
and that's unusual because

26:35.433 --> 26:38.533
usually Middle-Eastern people
have thicker skin.

26:38.533 --> 26:42.100
So we have to just make sure
that we make everything smooth

26:42.100 --> 26:45.133
on Pardis' nasal tip, otherwise
you're gonna see all the

26:45.133 --> 26:47.233
cartilage that I put in to
rebuild her nose.

26:47.233 --> 26:50.400
All right, let's take a look at
this dorsum.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.500
You know what we got to do?
We're gonna have to fracture

26:52.500 --> 26:55.767
these bones, because you leave
the dorsum a little higher and

26:55.767 --> 26:58.533
the bones are down, fracture
them, they come up a little bit.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.367
Now I can see that Pardis
clearly has an open roof

27:01.367 --> 27:03.433
deformity.
The nasal bones have a gap in

27:03.433 --> 27:06.133
them, and now the only thing I
can do is fracture the nasal

27:06.133 --> 27:09.133
bones, which will close the open
roof, and now she'll have a

27:09.133 --> 27:12.000
normal-looking roof, which
basically means a normal nasal

27:12.000 --> 27:13.700
contour.
She's got a pretty bad deviated

27:13.700 --> 27:16.033
septum.
>> It's severe.

27:16.033 --> 27:18.200
>> Yeah, it's really bad.
It's really obstructing her

27:18.200 --> 27:22.400
complete left airway.
Oh, there's your rib.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.433
>> There we have it.
>> Yeah, nice piece of rib.

27:25.433 --> 27:28.266
Septoplasty is done.
The turbinoplasty is done.

27:28.266 --> 27:30.300
Pretty much the entire
deconstruction of the nose is

27:30.300 --> 27:32.000
done.
Now it's straight

27:32.000 --> 27:35.033
reconstruction.
Any time you do work on the

27:35.033 --> 27:37.700
nasal tip, it's always the
hardest part of the case,

27:37.700 --> 27:40.533
because we have to make sure
it's symmetric, make sure it's

27:40.533 --> 27:44.166
still good looking and small
without being too small, make

27:44.166 --> 27:47.600
sure the airway is open.
So the majority of our focus is

27:47.600 --> 27:50.467
spent on the nasal tip.
Look at your--in her tip.

27:50.467 --> 27:55.300
Look.
Look how pretty that is.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.734
It's a cute nose.
The nose was a little trickier

27:57.734 --> 28:00.467
than I thought, and she'll have
a little bit more swelling

28:00.467 --> 28:03.166
because of the bleeding from the
nasal fractures, but overall

28:03.166 --> 28:05.166
her nose is gonna look
fantastic.

28:05.166 --> 28:08.500
She'll breathe a lot better, and
I know that Pardis is gonna be

28:08.500 --> 28:12.100
much happier with this new nose.
Thank you.

her buttock area, because that's

33:05.333 --> 33:10.066
the best and safest way to get
a large buttock projection.

33:10.066 --> 33:15.300
What you're asking for is this
expandable implant put in here.

33:15.300 --> 33:20.300
It's an interesting idea and it
has worked for you here, but

33:20.300 --> 33:26.467
there are several reasons why
this area is not exactly the

33:26.467 --> 33:29.433
same as this area.
So I want to show you something,

33:29.433 --> 33:31.233
okay?
But first I want you to change

33:31.233 --> 33:33.567
into your pantyhose, so we can
put some implants in and show

33:33.567 --> 33:35.333
you what we're talking about,
okay?

33:35.333 --> 33:38.600
Sometimes just telling a patient
a procedure is a bad idea isn't

33:38.600 --> 33:41.066
enough.
You have to show them.

33:41.066 --> 33:44.600
Now go ahead and sit down.

33:44.600 --> 33:49.567

33:49.567 --> 33:55.233
Maybe it doesn't work like
this--a little--oh.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.467
Whoa.
That's a little too much.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.300
>> It's a little bit too much,
right?

33:59.300 --> 34:02.066
>> Yeah.
Sitting on saline implants is

34:02.066 --> 34:05.767
sitting like on a rock.
That--I just crushing something.

34:05.767 --> 34:09.467
>> What's going on?
>> There's something that's--

34:09.467 --> 34:14.500
>> I mean, did it pop?
>> It's popped.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.333
See, it's already popped with
just this amount.

34:17.333 --> 34:21.533
This is why this particular
surgery is a really bad idea.

idea.
