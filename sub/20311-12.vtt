Angela: Hi Trudy.
Trudy: Hi Angela. Did he forget

00:05.130 --> 00:07.299
his lunch again?
Angela: He did. I told him I'd

00:07.299 --> 00:09.301
bring it and to meet
me at the office.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.719
Trudy: Why don't you just
grab a seat over there.

00:10.719 --> 00:16.224
Angela: Thank you.
Trudy: Ok.

00:16.224 --> 00:23.022
Gerry: Here's those forms Trudy.
Wow...

00:23.022 --> 00:28.028
Trudy whispers: Go for it!
Gerry: Hi, have you been looked

00:28.028 --> 00:30.823

Angela: Yes, I have, but

00:34.368 --> 00:35.870
Gerry laughs: Oh.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.877
Trudy: I think she likes you.
Gerry: Go talk to her?

00:42.877 --> 00:45.838
Trudy: Go for it!
Simon: Hey Gerry!

Simon: Hey mom.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.841
Angela: Hi sweetie.

Simon: Thanks mom, see ya.
Bye, Gerry.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.263
Gerry: See ya Simon.
Angela: Maybe I'll see you again

00:55.263 --> 00:56.557
sometime.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.061
Gerry: Never.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.817
Gerry: I was just thinking stuff
about Simon's mom I didn't...

01:06.817 --> 01:09.319
Trudy: Don't. Don't tell me
what you were thinking.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.530
Gerry: Wow, that's embarrassing.
No, I couldn't.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.824
Forget it. I'd be his father.

♪ I'm awesome,
no you're not dude, don't lie

01:21.248 --> 01:24.209
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving
around in my mom's ride

01:24.209 --> 01:29.798
♪ I'm awesome, a quarter
of my life gone by

01:29.798 --> 01:30.925
♪ I'm awesome, awesome,
awesome.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.470
Gerry: Why would you not...
I told you to put Mr. D at the

01:35.470 --> 01:37.389
bottom.
Then people would thing it was

01:37.389 --> 01:39.892
boxing Mr. Dwyer.
Gerry: No, they wouldn't.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.310
Dwyer: Gentlemen! There's a lot
of buzz about this charity

01:42.310 --> 01:44.730
boxing match you got goin' on.
Gerry: Pretty exciting. How's

01:44.730 --> 01:46.607
your cartoon thingy?
Dwyer: Definitely not as

01:46.607 --> 01:48.275
big as this man.
Gerry: Well, you're doin

01:48.275 --> 01:50.277
somethin' though, that's great.
Simon: You should draw a

01:50.277 --> 01:52.613
caricature of me
pulverizing Gerry.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.823
Gerry: Simon.
Dwyer: You think so?

01:54.823 --> 01:57.618
Gerry: We've gone through this
many times, we are staging this

01:57.618 --> 02:01.956
fight. 'K? It's not real, cause
if it's real and I try I'm

02:01.956 --> 02:04.041
gonna hurt you.
Simon: I'm not so sure about

02:04.041 --> 02:05.417
that to be honest.
Gerry: Have you ever been in a

02:05.417 --> 02:07.669
fight Simon?
Simon: No.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.504
Gerry: I have.
Punched in the face?

02:09.504 --> 02:12.758
Simon: No
Gerry: I have. That's why we're

02:12.758 --> 02:14.551
staging it.
Dwyer: Look, any help you need

02:14.551 --> 02:16.386
let me know, Champ, I gotcha.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.140
Gerry: See what he's
trying to do there?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.976
Simon: He hurt your shoulder?
Gerry:No he didn't hurt anything

02:21.976 --> 02:24.352
he's trying to get involved
with this so that he can

02:24.352 --> 02:27.648
take some credit for the biggest
event ever at this school.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.316
I'm not stupid.
Simon: Yeah, and we're going to

02:29.316 --> 02:31.234
make way more money
than that guy.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.655
Gerry: Not we, me. This is my
event. I don't mind you being

02:34.655 --> 02:37.866
part of it but I did it.
Simon: Yeah, but without me,

02:37.866 --> 02:42.663
this event doesn't exist. You
don't scare me Mr. Duncan, I've

02:42.663 --> 02:47.626
got moves you've never seen.
Come at cha from the front

02:47.626 --> 02:51.755
bop around like a kangaroo. Walk
away Mr. Duncan, you can't

02:51.755 --> 02:53.465
escape your fate.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.216
Robert: Dennis, don't do
that with your face...Hey, is

02:55.216 --> 02:58.303
that the new video game
"Confiscators"? Don't mind if I

02:58.303 --> 03:00.430
do.
Lisa: Hey, Robert.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.599
Robert: Ms. Mason
Lisa: Hey, is this your phone?

03:02.599 --> 03:07.146
I found it in the parking lot.
Robert: Yes, thank you!

03:07.146 --> 03:08.647
Lisa: No problem.
Robert: This has been happening

03:08.647 --> 03:10.607
so much lately. I have
to get a new belt clip.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.776
It keeps falling off.
Lisa: Yeah, I hate being

03:12.776 --> 03:15.403
without my phone, it's awful.
Robert: I don't think you

03:15.403 --> 03:18.323
understand. I haaate not having
my phone. It makes me feel like

03:18.323 --> 03:21.785
I have these bumblebees of worry
Lisa: Oh, ouch. So, uh when did

03:21.785 --> 03:23.954
you lose it?
Robert: Yesterday afternoon.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.165
Lisa: Oh
Robert: Zero missed calls,

03:26.165 --> 03:31.378
that's good. Zero text messages
and friend requests, nil.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.006
Lisa: Oh, well you didn't
miss anything

03:34.006 --> 03:37.467
Robert: Release the bees,
stinging you with thanks.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.512
Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzzzz
Lisa: Oh, ok...wow.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.139
Robert: How did a
mosquito get in there?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.933
[Lisa laughs uncomfortably]
Lisa: Yup.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.769
Robert: Which way ya walkin'?
Lisa:Um I'm going the other way.

03:47.769 --> 03:52.024
Robert: That's where I'm going.
Lisa: Ok, great, let's...

03:52.024 --> 03:53.441
Robert: Bzz.
Lisa: Ok.

Callaghan: No, please,
have a seat.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.452
No, no, no, no, no,
not so fast Mr. Duncan.

04:04.452 --> 04:11.168
You need to be singled out,
for special praise.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.796
In all the years we've been
doing this, your boxing event

04:14.796 --> 04:18.508
has raised THE most
money for Parkinson's.

04:21.553 --> 04:26.683
As an avid boxing fan myself
I tell ya, I am so excited that

04:26.683 --> 04:30.687
Xavier's gonna be hosting it's
first charity boxing event.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.064
So proud of you.
Gerry: Thank you

04:32.064 --> 04:33.690
Callaghan: Fantastic.
Very impressive.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.984
Gerry: Thank you.
Callaghan: Oh, listen, could you

04:35.984 --> 04:38.486
and Mr. Hunt drop by the office
afterwards? After class?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.655
We'll talk over a few things.
Gerry: Yes.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.824
Callaghan: Ok great.
Alright, teach hard.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
Gerry: Teach hard.
Callaghan: Carry on.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.288
Gerry: Did you guys
hear all that?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.082
Jimmy: Sir, you got called
to the Principal's office.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.793
Gerry: Nope, get out.
Jimmy: What?

04:52.793 --> 04:56.713
Gerry: Jimmy, you're not
ruining this moment. Buh bye.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.424
Gerry: New rule, you say
something stupid, you will leave

04:59.424 --> 05:01.802
class.
Benjamin: Where would we go?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.845
Gerry: Don't know, don't care.
Benjamin: What if something

05:03.845 --> 05:06.473
happens? You'd be responsible.
Gerry: Get out.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.976
Benjamin: Seriously?
Gerry: Seriously. Not raining on

05:08.976 --> 05:12.187
my parade right now,
nobody is.

05:14.148 --> 05:18.318
How many of you...have had the
principal say he's proud of you?

05:18.318 --> 05:22.322
No, ok. Rhetorical.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.617
Just give me a minute
here to get organized.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.036
Callaghan: Gentlemen, we're
getting some local press

05:28.036 --> 05:29.621
interest in this thing. So I
thought I'd teach you

05:29.621 --> 05:31.248
a few things to help
it make it look a bit

05:31.248 --> 05:33.500
more real, know what I mean?
Simon: Can we make

05:33.500 --> 05:35.502
it so that I win?
Gerry: No we cannot Simon.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.795
Simon: Why not?
Callaghan: I don't think that

05:36.795 --> 05:39.047
would be very believable Simon,
you're such a thin little guy.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.548
Gerry: You look
sick all the time.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.218
Simon: Ok, yeah I got
asthma, allergies. Sure, I

05:43.218 --> 05:47.722
understand. Thank you.
Callaghan: Ok, Simon, stand up.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.641
Simon: Do you want Gerry
to stand up too?

05:49.641 --> 05:52.269
Callaghan: That's ok, just
you and me. Put these on.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.104
Now, just because this

05:54.104 --> 05:56.355
is a charity match doesn't mean
we can't put a little pepper in

05:56.355 --> 05:58.192
those punches. Alright?
Simon: These things are heavy.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.027
Gerry: Pay attention.
Callaghan: Alright, now I'm

06:00.027 --> 06:01.402
gonna throw a punch, you're
gonna block it with your hands,

06:01.402 --> 06:03.404
very important your
first line of defense, your

06:03.404 --> 06:05.699
hands for your face alright?
Simon: Ok

06:05.699 --> 06:07.242
Callaghan: I'm gonna throw a
punch, you're gonna block it

06:07.242 --> 06:10.453
with your left hand alright?
Simon: Ahhhhh

06:10.453 --> 06:12.371
Callaghan: Come on
you gotta be kidding.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.709
I barely touched the guy.
Simon: Gerry, call my mom.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.838
Gerry: Oh boy.
Callaghan: Do you know his mom?

06:19.838 --> 06:23.091
Lisa: You don't have to buy me
any more apples ok, alright?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.844
Now go.
I'm allergic to them. Okay.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.264
Robert: There she is again.
Being helpful, as always.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.641
Lisa: That's my job.
Robert: I got a hilarious email

06:31.641 --> 06:35.312
forward this morning cats who
bowl, I should forward it to ya.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.938
Lisa: Oh no that's...
Robert: Got it on my phone

06:36.938 --> 06:39.398
that you found, 'member?
Lisa: Yeah, yeah this morning.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.276
Robert: Better yet, why don't I
just print off a hard copy and

06:41.276 --> 06:44.487
I'll give it to you at lunch in
my office tomorrow.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.366
Lisa: Oh, I've got a tutorial so
Robert: 12:05, perfect. I'll

06:47.366 --> 06:50.160
see you then. I might have been
the one who lost my phone but

06:50.160 --> 06:54.413
you were the one that answered
the call of friendship.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.000
Lisa: Oh, it's...yeah...
Robert: Brrring...

06:57.000 --> 07:00.921
Robert: Brrring...hello?
Is my friend there?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.422
Yes she is just a minute
let me put her on.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.801
Do you have a second?
Lisa: Oh, sure. Hello?

07:06.801 --> 07:09.263
Yeah it's Lisa.
Robert: No there's no one there.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.557
Lisa: It's just, end call.
Robert: You don't have to hang

07:12.557 --> 07:17.104
up, it's not even a real call.
Lisa: Ok, see ya tomorrow, ok.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.356
Robert: 12:05.
Lisa: Ok, alright.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.901

Gerry: Hey, how is he?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.237
Callaghan: It's not
good. His jaw.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.654
Gerry: Ok, I'll just punch
him right in there.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.115
Callaghan: Well he can't fight.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.824
Gerry: Yeah, I won't hit him
in the face sir,

07:29.824 --> 07:31.534
I'll just go right, I'll just
hit him everything right...

07:31.534 --> 07:33.078
Callaghan: Nooo, you have to
get somebody else.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.579
Gerry: Are you serious?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.539
Callaghan: Yeah, he wasn't
the fighting type anyway.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.877
Gerry: Yeah, that's my point.
That's what I liked about it.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.591
Jeff: Gerry!
Gerry: Morning Jeff.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.051
Jeff: Hey, ah heard you're
looking for an opponent

07:48.051 --> 07:49.594
for the big fight.
Gerry: Yeah, Simon got hurt.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.512
Jeff: Yeah, I mean I'd
love to help out.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.514
Gerry: Nah, that wouldn't work.
Jeff: I think it'd be awesome, I

07:53.514 --> 07:55.392
just want to get in the ring and
you know, make some money for

07:55.392 --> 07:58.019
charity. I think it'd be good.
Gerry: Ah yeah listen Mr. Lemire

07:58.019 --> 08:00.063
it would be really confusing for
everybody cause they already

08:00.063 --> 08:02.690
think we're the same person
walking around and if I fought

08:02.690 --> 08:06.027
you in the ring, it's gonna feel
like the same person fighting.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.821
They're not gonna know
who to cheer it just...

08:07.821 --> 08:10.824
Jeff: Gerry I don't think a lot
of people think we look alike.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.659
Gerry: Yeah, really they do, you
don't know because you probably

08:12.659 --> 08:14.995
think they're talking about me.
But thank you, it's really nice

08:14.995 --> 08:17.456
of ya, ok? Alright?
Jeff: Yeah, ok.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.540

a little tight.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.377
Jeff: Athletic fit...I guess.
Gerry: Yeah, mine's same build

08:22.377 --> 08:24.087
underneath but a little
less revealing.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.880
Jeff: It's too much? Yeah.
Gerry: A little bit.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.674

Jeff: Oh it's wheatgrass.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.176
Gerry: Wheatgrass?
Jeff: Yeah give ya a boost.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.095
You should have some.
Gerry: Mmm coffee, sugar,

08:32.095 --> 08:37.392
glycolysis you should know that
ok? Grass is for cows, alright?

08:37.392 --> 08:41.104

too careful now a days. So as

Lisa: Yeah.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.667
Robert: I haven't thanked
you there. I think

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
that's the nicest way you can
say thanks to someone.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.212
Lisa: Yay.
[Knock at door]

09:47.212 --> 09:49.172
Robert: That's our food.
Lisa: Ok.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.177
Robert: Garçon
Lisa: Thank you.

09:59.891 --> 10:05.480
Lisa: Grilled cheese from the
cafeteria, did you want any?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.732
Robert: She's fine.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.527
Gerry: Alan your heart will be
fine. I'll do all the work. We

10:10.527 --> 10:13.238
just have to dance around a
little, couple shots right here.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.448
Callaghan: Duncan, did you find
a new opponent yet?

10:14.448 --> 10:17.367
Gerry: Alan?
Alan: No.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.245
Gerry: Thanks that's pathetic.
No, sir.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.747
Callaghan: Great news! Paul
Dwyer's agreed to fight you, he

10:22.747 --> 10:25.125
used to box when he was a kid so
he knows just what he's doing.

10:25.125 --> 10:29.254
Gerry: Ok, we're not really the
same weight, so that's gonna...

10:29.254 --> 10:31.756
Dwyer: Gerry, come on
man, I'm a buck eighty.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.134
Gerry: One eighty-four,
ah too bad.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.177
Dwyer: Look, kids are gonna
love it, it's for a charity,

10:36.177 --> 10:38.179
it's gonna be fun.
Alright, we talk later.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.140
Callaghan: It's gonna be great!
They, they changed the posters

10:40.140 --> 10:43.602
for us and everything, no extra
charge. It's gonna be fantastic.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.396
Gerry: It's already...you've
already done posters? So it's

10:46.396 --> 10:48.731
already happening?
Callaghan: Yeah

10:48.731 --> 10:51.985
Gerry: I'm gung ho.
Callaghan: You good?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.070
Gerry: Yeah
Callaghan: Alright.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.823
Gerry: Does he know it's staged?
Callaghan: Yeah, I think...ok?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.493
Gerry:Yeah, good, thank you sir.
Callaghan: Alright, good stuff.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.414
Gerry: Ka'bah Sanctuary at
Mecca? Nobody remembers what?

11:04.414 --> 11:06.416
Gerry: Sheila?
Sheila: Sir, are you scared to

11:06.416 --> 11:09.586
fight Mr. D?
Gerry: First of all, we're not

11:09.586 --> 11:15.300
talking about that, I'm not
fighting Mr. Dwyer. I am boxing.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.553
Ok? Big difference.
Lori: But are you scared sir?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.263
Gerry: Why would I
be scared Lori?

11:20.263 --> 11:22.223
Lori: People are just saying
maybe you are scared.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.767
Gerry: Well people are wrong
ok? Have you asked Mr. Dwyer if
he's

11:24.767 --> 11:28.062
scared? Cause I heard he's a
little bit scared right now.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.023
Sheila: I haven't heard that
sir, he doesn't seem

11:30.023 --> 11:32.691
worried about you.
Gerry: Well, he should. Can we

11:32.691 --> 11:36.029
get back to this please? Sheila?
Ka'bah Sanctuary at Mecca

11:36.029 --> 11:39.574
Nobody knows? We've talked
about this for two days.

11:39.574 --> 11:44.371
It is a sacred place
for Muslims.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.958
Lori: You wrote "scared"
on the board sir.

11:48.958 --> 11:54.589
Gerry: So it's a "scary"
or "sacred" place.

11:54.589 --> 11:59.427
Ok? Ok Lori?
Thank you.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.973
Bobbi: Hey, Gerry, do you
wanna ah help out with the

12:03.973 --> 12:05.724
charity day dunk tank?
Gerry: Oh, you know I can't

12:05.724 --> 12:07.394
do that cause I'm boxing Dwyer.
Bobbi: Oh, you're still

12:07.394 --> 12:11.022
gonna go through with that? Wow.
Gerry: Wow? What is wow?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.024
Bobbi: Well, I mean Dwyer's the
nicest guy I know, but...

12:13.024 --> 12:16.735
I'd be worried if I were you.
It could get ugly in there.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.321
Gerry: What are you talking
about gonna get ugly?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.073
He knows it's staged. He
knows it's for the kids.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.741
Bobbi: He's been boxing all
his life, he's really good.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.827
And, he doesn't like you
cause of how you've

12:24.827 --> 12:26.871
treated him this year so.
Gerry: What are you talking

12:26.871 --> 12:29.457
about? The way I've treated him?
Bobbi: I overheard him saying

12:29.457 --> 12:33.878
that he was going to destroy you
Gerry: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.714
Bobbi: It's probably
just trash talk.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.383
Gerry: Yes! Yeah, yeah
Bobbi: Probably make breaking

12:38.383 --> 12:42.721
your nose look like an accident.
Gerry: You're messing with me.

12:42.721 --> 12:47.934
You're messing with me.
Bobbi laughing: Yeah...

12:47.934 --> 12:49.728

12:49.728 --> 12:52.897
[Gerry and Bobbi laughing]

12:52.897 --> 12:54.899
Gerry: Mmm that's funny.
Bobbi: Yeah or am I?

12:54.899 --> 13:01.197
Bobbi: Be careful.
Gerry: What? Bobbi?

13:03.450 --> 13:07.579
Lisa: Trudy. I need your help.
Trudy: Oh ok dear,

Lisa: Robert is driving me nuts.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.375
Trudy: Big surprise there.
Shocked.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.961
What's he getting up to?
Lisa: Ok, yesterday I found his

13:14.961 --> 13:19.716
phone and now it's like we're
best friends or something and

13:19.716 --> 13:23.261

and and he does this thing with

13:23.261 --> 13:25.430
the bees and like...ya know?
Trudy: Oh yeah.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.974
Lisa: And he's just being nice
and he's trying to make a

13:27.974 --> 13:32.395
friend but he's really kind of
freaking me out here. Oh my God.

13:32.395 --> 13:37.651
Trudy: Listen, don't you worry.

13:37.651 --> 13:42.155

Lisa: Ok, what are you doing?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.990
Trudy: Quit trying to be
friends with Lisa, you're

13:43.990 --> 13:45.199
creeping her out.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.710
Lisa: Trudy!
Trudy: Oh, you are very welcome.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.879
Anything else dear?
Lisa: No.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.509
Trudy: Ok, you have a
one honey.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.385
Gerry: This was a bad idea.
Bill: I thought it was like

14:04.385 --> 14:06.680
a fun charity match.
Gerry: Yeah, it's supposed to

14:06.680 --> 14:08.682
be but this guy's apparently
taking it seriously and he's...

14:08.682 --> 14:11.309
Bill: You gotta watch "Rocky"
that's what you gotta do.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.437
Gerry: Oh yeah ok, I'll just go
watch "Rocky" a couple times.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.064
Bill: It'll like build up your,
you know, your enthusiasm,

14:17.064 --> 14:20.067

Gerry: And "Bullwinkle"?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.736
See that too?
Bill: Don't even worry man, I've

14:21.736 --> 14:23.571
been in a ton of fights.
You gotta come out,

14:23.571 --> 14:26.240
strong offense, best defense.
Gerry: You told me you were

14:26.240 --> 14:28.827
in two fights in grade school.
Bill: Yeah, I'm 2 and 0.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.664
Perfect...you extrapolate that.
Gerry: Yeah ok, I gotta

14:32.664 --> 14:34.582
come out first, fast.
Bill: You need to just come out

14:34.582 --> 14:36.209
fast and hard man.
Gerry:Throw the first punch.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.836
Bill: Throw the first punch.
You want to be the sucker,

14:37.836 --> 14:39.713
not the suckee.
Gerry: Be the sucker, not the
suckee.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.422
Bill: You're like a jungle
cat. Just come out,

14:41.422 --> 14:43.257

my corner man.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
Bill: I'll be your corner man.
Gerry: Yeah.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.350
Bill: This is gonna be the best.
We could get jackets. Right.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.895
Gerry: Now we're talking.
Yeah, I think he fought

14:55.895 --> 15:00.066
a lot so...as a kid.
Bill:I don't see that going well

15:00.066 --> 15:01.901
Gerry: It'll be fine.
Bill: I thought it was two

15:01.901 --> 15:04.070
teachers just messing around
like a guy like that, he could

15:04.070 --> 15:06.573
break your jaw without even
trying man, that's for real.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.409
Gerry:Ok, just see ya later, go.
Bill: I'm just saying,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.536
you could get hurt, you need
to know how to protect

15:11.536 --> 15:14.914
your head. I think you
should watch "Rocky".

15:14.914 --> 15:16.750
Gerry: See ya, yeah...
Bill: Watch all of it.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.958

15:33.391 --> 15:35.976
Robert: Oh, cause you punched me
in the feelings? Yeah don't

15:35.976 --> 15:38.855
worry about it. I'm well aware
of what my flaws are. I know

15:38.855 --> 15:41.691
what my shortcomings are, I come
on a little strong and push

15:41.691 --> 15:45.528
people away. It's not the first
emotional rodeo for this cowboy.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.822
Sometimes when you fly close to
the friend sun, you're gonna get

15:47.822 --> 15:49.783
burnt huh? That's what
happened, no biggie.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.951
Lisa: Oh, but Robert,
I do like you.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.330
Robert: It doesn't matter, I
like me. I'm friends with me.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.792
Maybe I wish they made bandaids
for the inside right now,

15:58.792 --> 16:00.627
but they don't.
Lisa: Okay.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.930
Lisa: No.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.515
Callaghan: Ladies and gentlemen,

There's the rope, get the rope

16:39.749 --> 16:42.376
Bill: Oh, okay.
Gerry: You're supposed to hold

16:42.376 --> 16:45.505
it down like this.
Bill: We should have been doing

16:45.505 --> 16:46.965
a training montage.
Gerry: This thing's tight on my

16:46.965 --> 16:49.216
face, it's too tight.
Take my mouthguard out.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.927
Bill: I'm not going to put my
fingers in your mouth.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.513
It's gross. Live with it.

16:53.513 --> 16:59.059
[Music starts]
[Crowd goes wild]

16:59.059 --> 17:01.813

Kids are gonna love this.
Jeff: Yeah, he did.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.966
Jeff: Why's he wearing all that
protective gear? He knows

17:29.966 --> 17:33.135
this isn't real right?
Gerry: It's for charity Paul!

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
Bill: He's pretty ripped.
Gerry: Oh my god.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.640

17:57.326 --> 17:59.746
[Crowd hardly reacts]

17:59.746 --> 18:01.915

18:01.915 --> 18:04.291
Gerry: Who got the
bigger applause?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.586
Bill: I don't think you need to
worry about applause right now.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.379
Ya gotta...are you going

18:08.379 --> 18:10.757
Gerry: No.
Bill: No, that's a good idea.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.301
Gerry: Okay, don't!
Bill: He's doin' that thing

18:14.301 --> 18:17.304
with his pecks.
Gerry: Ok, stop. Just shut up.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.891
Callaghan: Alright gentlemen,

18:19.891 --> 18:22.810

Callaghan: Alright gentlemen.
Let's keep it clean. Let's try

18:28.066 --> 18:30.401

Alright?
Gerry: Okay, okay.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.576

18:49.462 --> 18:51.839
Gerry: Put the phone away!!
Bill: I'm almost done.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.675
Gerry: Throw me the towel!
That's a red towel! Why would

18:54.675 --> 18:56.510
you bring a red towel.
Bill: Ok, I'll throw it to you,

18:56.510 --> 18:58.429
you'll be fine.
Gerry: Ok, what do I do?

18:58.429 --> 19:02.224
Bill: No, focus, one shot. Just,
you don't have a chance.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.769
He's in way better shape than
you. You're gonna die! Get him.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.270

Callaghan: Wake up Paul.

19:25.957 --> 19:29.543
It was supposed to be staged.
Gerry: He came at me sir.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.796
Callaghan: Paul, Paul?
Are you ok? Paul?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.798
You sucker punched him.
Gerry: The bell rang.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.174
What was he looking at?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.968
Simon: He's dead.
Bobbi: He's not dead.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.511
Simon: No, he's dead.
I've seen dead people.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.804
Gerry: Paul, stop foolin'
around.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.473
It's Mr. D. The new Mr. D.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.267
Don't say anything
if I'm Mr. D.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.186
If I'm Mr D, don't say
anything.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.938
Callaghan: Go to your corner.
Gerry: Make sure he knows I'm

19:48.938 --> 19:50.982
Mr. D, 'cause he might not hear
me with the mouth guard.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.483
Callaghan: I'll tell him.
Bill: You're dropping spit on
his arm.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.568
Gerry: I'm Mr. D now

19:54.568 --> 19:56.154
Bill: That was awesome.
Gerry: I know, it

19:56.154 --> 19:59.490

20:11.961 --> 20:14.672
Gerry: Look at you man.
Dwyer: That's quite a punch

20:14.672 --> 20:17.299
Mr. Duncan. I wasn't
expecting all that.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.302
Gerry: I didn't expect the hood
and the glasses and robe and the

20:20.302 --> 20:22.596
serious look on your face.
Dwyer: It's supposed to be a

20:22.596 --> 20:24.223
for the kids, come on man.
Gerry: Yeah, freaked me out a

20:24.223 --> 20:25.474
little bit, thought you
were mad at me. That's why...

20:25.474 --> 20:27.185
Dwyer: Why would
I be mad at you?

20:27.185 --> 20:28.686
Gerry: I don't know people
were telling me you were mad

20:28.686 --> 20:30.479
and you were gonna
knock me out and all this

20:30.479 --> 20:33.774

intense, you're Mr. D, I'm Mr. D

20:33.774 --> 20:35.526
I was...
Dwyer: Let that go man, you

20:35.526 --> 20:37.403
gotta let that go, let it go.
Gerry: I know, I know.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.906
Dwyer: Let it go kids are
gonna call you what
they gonna call you.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.616
Gerry: Two Mr. D's in the
same school, so what?
Dwyer: You got it my man.

20:42.616 --> 20:46.453
Gerry: Ok, Mr. D, Mr. D
cause you're in here, see

20:46.453 --> 20:49.749

Dwyer: This is my card.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.585
Gerry: I know, is it? Or is it
for winning? I don't know.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.713
Get some rest.
Dwyer: Ok, speaking of rest, I

20:55.713 --> 20:58.424
was wondering if you could
you could stay awhile?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.218
Gerry: I got a couple minutes,
I got a couple minutes.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.344
Dwyer: I'm not supposed to
sleep, it's a precaution, 'cause

21:02.344 --> 21:08.475
of my concussion.
It would mean a lot to me.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.687
Gerry: Ok, I can.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.784
Dwyer: Let's go, wake
up, wake up

21:24.784 --> 21:26.827
Gerry: When did I fall asleep?
Dwyer: As soon as you sat down.

21:26.827 --> 21:31.415
I had to keep myself up,
so I wouldn't die!

21:31.415 --> 21:34.919
Gerry: That's a bit dramatic.
Dwyer: Yeah, anyway thanks for

21:34.919 --> 21:36.712
staying with me.
Gerry: Yeah.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.005
Dwyer: You know we're gonna have
to do this again next year

21:38.005 --> 21:39.548

Gerry: Yeah

21:39.548 --> 21:41.801
Dwyer: Except this

21:47.098 --> 21:49.516
Gerry: You're messing with me.
