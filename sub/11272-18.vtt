WEBVTT

00:06.502 --> 00:09.077
- Chekhov.
- No, Norm, it was lbsen.

00:09.256 --> 00:12.258
lt was Chekhov
lt was ''The Cherry Orchard.''

00:12.427 --> 00:15.633
You're full of it.
lt was lbsen, ''The Master Builder.''

00:15.808 --> 00:18.300
- lt was Chekhov.
- lbsen, lbsen, lbsen.

00:18.478 --> 00:20.604
- Chekhov, Chekhov...
- lbsen!

00:20.774 --> 00:23.232
Excuse me. l don't mean to stop you,

00:23.404 --> 00:27.237
but you are talking about Anton Chekhov
and Henrik lbsen?

00:27.410 --> 00:31.741
Of course we're talking about
Anton Chekhov and Henrik lbsen.

00:31.917 --> 00:36.832
This is wonderful!
Perhaps l might be of some assistance.

00:37.008 --> 00:40.842
l would love to contribute
to your literary enquiry.

00:41.015 --> 00:43.720
- l suppose she can help?
- Please, please.

00:43.893 --> 00:46.980
- lf anybody can, you can.
- l'd like to think so.

00:47.149 --> 00:50.152
OK, what were you watching
on TV that night

00:50.321 --> 00:54.903
when Norm gorged on cheese doodles
and whistled ''The Way We Were''?

00:56.957 --> 01:00.909
lbsen. And it was taco chips.

01:02.091 --> 01:04.796
- Pay up. Let's go.
- All right.

01:04.970 --> 01:07.843
l guess it was
Chekhov and cheese doodles

01:08.017 --> 01:11.054
the night Artie tried
to comb his hair with his feet.

01:11.230 --> 01:15.361
Yeah, you're on thin ice
arguing the classics with me.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

02:32.734 --> 02:36.816
- Hey, Sammy, long time.
- How have you been?

02:36.991 --> 02:39.696
- About the same. You?
- l never change.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.781
- What'll you have?
- My usual.

02:41.957 --> 02:44.415
You still drinking that stuff?

02:44.587 --> 02:48.634
- Who is that guy?
- l don't know. He's your friend.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.842
l don't know him. You guys?

02:51.013 --> 02:55.014
He's never been here before.
l'm very good at placing faces.

02:55.187 --> 02:58.807
Yeah? Then place yours
where we can't see it.

03:00.821 --> 03:04.442
- l wish Coach were here, he'd know.
- Where is he?

03:04.619 --> 03:09.746
He went to get his driver's licence
renewed, he'll be back next week.

03:10.879 --> 03:13.667
- Why so long?
- He went to Vermont.

03:13.841 --> 03:15.918
He heard the test was easier there.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.966
Why don't you just ask him his name?

03:19.141 --> 03:22.428
Better a minute of embarrassment
than look a fool.

03:22.605 --> 03:26.022
No, it'd be too easy. l can handle this.

03:26.194 --> 03:30.195
You know how good l am
at thinking on my feet.

03:30.368 --> 03:33.738
l've seen you add and subtract on them.

03:33.915 --> 03:38.331
- Subtraction must kinda hurt?
- Watch and learn.

03:38.505 --> 03:43.087
lnstead of your usual,
l thought you might like a Manhattan.

03:43.263 --> 03:46.599
- Manhattan is my usual.
- Gotcha!

03:49.315 --> 03:51.355
- How's work?
- Fine.

03:51.526 --> 03:55.229
You still work in the same place?
lt had a real funny name...

03:55.408 --> 04:00.155
- My house.
- Right! l still get a kick out of that.

04:00.332 --> 04:04.582
l'm still working the same crummy job,
stuffing envelopes,

04:04.756 --> 04:06.797
but l'm glad you find that funny.

04:06.967 --> 04:13.388
l didn't mean funny in the humorous
sense. l meant funny more in the...

04:13.560 --> 04:15.602
Who the hell are you?

04:15.774 --> 04:19.725
- l'm Eddie Gordon.
- Eddie... Eddie Gordon?

04:19.904 --> 04:22.113
l don't know who he is.

04:22.284 --> 04:26.034
A year ago, you bet me your bar
you could marry Jacqueline Bisset

04:26.206 --> 04:31.417
- by midnight tomorrow.
- Come on, who the hell would...

04:31.590 --> 04:33.667
Oh, Eddie Gordon.

04:35.053 --> 04:37.261
Jeez, how the hell are you, Eddie?

04:37.432 --> 04:40.388
- ls it coming back to you, Sam?
- Yeah.

04:40.562 --> 04:43.850
l'm a little hazy,
l had a few too many that night.

04:44.027 --> 04:49.485
- You had a lot too many that night.
- l was going through a rough period.

04:49.661 --> 04:56.581
How are you and Jackie getting along?
You didn't invite me to the wedding.

04:57.924 --> 05:00.166
l must have been drinking tequila.

05:00.343 --> 05:04.594
l always want Jacqueline Bisset
when l drink tequila.

05:04.769 --> 05:09.432
But l bet you don't always write it down,
signing your name in front of witnesses.

05:09.608 --> 05:12.730
- l did that, too?
- Yeah.

05:12.905 --> 05:15.231
Keep it, it's a copy.

05:16.370 --> 05:19.822
Listen, this was obviously
a joke, Eddie.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.418
l'm no expert,
but l know a little bit about the law

05:23.589 --> 05:26.675
and this sounds like a crock.
You'll never own this bar.

05:26.844 --> 05:30.797
When l take over, l'm thinking
of serving free chicken wings.

05:30.976 --> 05:33.551
Sorry, Sam, the law's the law.

05:35.232 --> 05:39.564
What do you say to those
little meatballs, get a Sterno flame...

05:41.033 --> 05:48.120
- Eddie, as a drinking partner, you stink!
- l'm sorry you feel that way, Sam.

05:48.295 --> 05:52.592
l'll see you tomorrow at midnight,
when the bar becomes mine.

05:52.761 --> 05:56.179
You've thought about serving crab puffs?

05:56.350 --> 05:58.723
Melvilles does them in mustard sauce.

05:58.896 --> 06:02.978
lf you're serious about this,
you don't have a leg to stand on.

06:03.153 --> 06:05.194
Most snakes don't.

06:05.365 --> 06:10.908
We'll find out in court. My attorney's
looked it over, he says we've got a shot.

06:11.082 --> 06:16.423
Don't get upset, you'll still have your job.
l'm going to need a bartender.

06:20.304 --> 06:23.473
You actually went out drinking
with that man?

06:23.643 --> 06:26.680
That's not the worst. l picked up the bill.

06:28.818 --> 06:33.898
- This has to be a joke, doesn't it?
- Let an attorney take a look at that.

06:34.076 --> 06:41.043
You know of one, or did you finally pass
your bar exam using the pity clause?

06:41.212 --> 06:45.260
When l pass my bar exam, Cliff,
you're going to eat your words.

06:45.428 --> 06:48.265
Yeah, if l got any teeth left.

06:48.433 --> 06:52.598
What do you think,
Mr Witless for the prosecution?

06:52.773 --> 06:58.399
lt seems you signed an agreement with
Eddie which may or may not be binding.

06:58.573 --> 07:03.404
Tom, knock off the legalese. Talk to us
in a language we can understand.

07:03.582 --> 07:07.830
Trust me, Sam, this thing won't hold up.
You were drunk, right?

07:08.005 --> 07:12.219
lt's not a contract, it's a wager.
You'll win this case easy.

07:12.387 --> 07:15.093
Tom's right. Let Eddie press his case.

07:15.266 --> 07:18.768
We'll get a good lawyer
and make a monkey out of him.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.107
- Oh, boy, oh...
- What? What's wrong?

07:22.277 --> 07:25.816
lf you don't trust Tom,
get a second opinion.

07:25.993 --> 07:29.363
No, it's not that.
l can't let Eddie take me to court.

07:29.540 --> 07:31.201
Why?

07:31.376 --> 07:37.382
l'd have to testify that l was drunk
and made an idiot out of myself.

07:37.552 --> 07:39.593
You're worried about the publicity?

07:39.765 --> 07:44.725
The press wasn't exactly kind to me
when l drank myself out of baseball.

07:44.897 --> 07:48.684
l'd almost rather lose the bar
than be humiliated again.

07:48.862 --> 07:51.188
Oh, Sam.

07:51.366 --> 07:53.940
Quit acting human, it confuses me.

07:55.748 --> 07:58.786
l don't suppose you could marry her?

07:58.962 --> 08:04.125
Yeah. Find, meet, woo
Jacqueline Bisset in two days?

08:04.303 --> 08:06.593
lt'd take at least a week.

08:06.766 --> 08:11.977
- You kidding? Five working days, tops.
- Wait, l've got an idea.

08:12.150 --> 08:16.279
You've actually conceived
something besides a child?

08:18.702 --> 08:21.620
A bitter and unprovoked attack.

08:21.789 --> 08:24.496
- l like it.
- What have you got?

08:24.669 --> 08:27.078
Sam, this doesn't say anything

08:27.257 --> 08:30.793
about having to marry
Jacqueline Bisset, the movie actress.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.092
There's got to be more than one
Jacqueline Bisset.

08:34.267 --> 08:37.056
Marry one, win the bet
and get a quick divorce.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.604
Eddie won't be able to say a thing.

08:39.775 --> 08:45.153
All l have to do is find another
Jacqueline Bisset and marry her?

08:45.326 --> 08:47.819
- lt can't be that simple.
- Sam...

08:47.996 --> 08:50.835
Hush, hush, l'm thinking.

08:51.003 --> 08:55.084
Someone note the date and the time.

08:55.259 --> 08:58.761
We've got to call information
all over the country.

08:58.932 --> 09:01.258
l think l can help you out there.

09:01.435 --> 09:05.186
l have the phone books
of every major city in the country.

09:05.358 --> 09:08.811
- Why?
- l just collect phone book cover art.

09:08.988 --> 09:11.029
One of those.

09:11.201 --> 09:15.830
This'll be fun.
We'll find anybody called Bisset,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.918
ask if they have a relative named
Jacqueline and get them to come here.

09:20.091 --> 09:22.250
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

09:28.937 --> 09:31.512
- So much for the Sun Belt.
- Norm!

09:31.692 --> 09:35.443
You Philistine, you just put a fold
in ''Sunrise Over Albuquerque''.

09:35.615 --> 09:37.359
Hey, boys...

09:37.534 --> 09:42.246
l'd expect there'd be a few Jacqueline
Bissets. lt can't be that uncommon.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.791
l got a Jacqueline Bisset on the phone.

09:44.963 --> 09:48.131
- Paydirt!
- She sounds sweet, but there's a catch.

09:48.301 --> 09:52.171
She's 93,
she lives in a rest home in Maine.

09:52.351 --> 09:54.889
- So is she married?
- l didn't ask.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.103
Are you married?

09:58.944 --> 10:03.192
Got a 94-year-old husband,
been married 73 years.

10:03.367 --> 10:05.445
Happy years?

10:07.291 --> 10:11.125
l just talked to a man
in Green Bank, West Virginia,

10:11.297 --> 10:15.676
with a grand-daughter named Jacqueline
Bisset, 25-years-old and unmarried.

10:15.845 --> 10:18.005
- Let me talk to her.
- l already did.

10:18.183 --> 10:21.020
Jackie will be here tomorrow morning.

10:21.189 --> 10:24.559
- How did you do it?
- A little ingenuity.

10:24.735 --> 10:28.188
l told her she'd won a trip to Boston
in a radio game show.

10:28.366 --> 10:32.531
- Just convince her to marry you.
- l could kiss you.

10:32.706 --> 10:37.584
Yeah, you can. But l warn you,
you're not going to get anywhere.

10:39.175 --> 10:44.136
- l offered prizes to induce her to come.
- That's OK, like what?

10:44.307 --> 10:46.717
Free round-trip air fare, first class,

10:46.895 --> 10:51.025
suite at the Ritz, free historical tour,
matched set of luggage.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.944
- Why not offer her a car?
- l did, but she took the cash instead.

10:56.076 --> 10:59.079
Only kidding, Sammy.
The point is, she'll be here.

10:59.248 --> 11:03.912
You're right, you're right.
My problems are over.

11:04.088 --> 11:09.798
Aren't you forgetting one important step?
You still have to get her to marry you.

11:09.973 --> 11:15.351
lt's no problem. As soon as l get her
face-to-face, she'll fall under my spell.

11:15.523 --> 11:20.272
- You killer.
- Sam, your vanity knows no bounds.

11:21.533 --> 11:24.821
l guess l ought to wear my best outfit.

11:24.998 --> 11:28.499
Diane, when you dream of me,
what am l wearing?

11:28.670 --> 11:30.710
An ant hill.

11:40.814 --> 11:47.022
Congratulations, Coach. All the weeks of
cramming and drilling with your friends,

11:47.199 --> 11:49.905
it's all paid off.
We're proud of you.

11:50.078 --> 11:52.202
All right. Take care.

11:52.373 --> 11:56.456
- Coach passed his driver's test?
- No, he found Vermont.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.390
- When's your ex-wife-to-be to be here?
- She's supposed to be here now.

12:03.558 --> 12:05.932
Cliff was meant to pick her up
two hours ago.

12:06.104 --> 12:09.060
- Are you ready?
- l don't know. What do you think?

12:09.233 --> 12:12.236
Yes! Any girl would jump
at the chance to marry you.

12:12.406 --> 12:15.528
Sam, there is one problem, however.

12:15.703 --> 12:20.035
l believe l detect a hint of fresh air
coming through your cologne.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.963
You're kidding.

12:23.131 --> 12:27.795
l must have missed a couple
of important pulse points. Thank you.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.766
This is ''Cheers'', Miss Bisset.
That's Sam Malone.

12:33.314 --> 12:35.807
Well, he is good-looking.

12:35.985 --> 12:39.190
The bad news is he talks.

12:39.365 --> 12:44.908
- Miss Bisset, Sam Malone.
- Oh, boy, thank you for coming.

12:45.082 --> 12:49.298
Cliff, set those bags down here.
Come and sit down by the bar.

12:49.466 --> 12:53.335
Listen, did Cliff explain
why we need you?

12:53.513 --> 12:56.883
Yes, he did,
and l'm not marrying anybody

12:57.060 --> 13:00.811
except in the usual way,
where the groom isn't a total stranger.

13:00.983 --> 13:05.065
l understand that,
but this isn't like a real marriage.

13:05.239 --> 13:10.485
lt's just for a few hours, until l win a bet,
then we'll get it annulled tomorrow.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.620
Why not consider it a warm-up
for the real thing?

13:13.795 --> 13:17.842
l'm sorry, l'm just not interested.

13:18.010 --> 13:22.841
l almost didn't make this trip when
l thought it was a legitimate contest.

13:23.019 --> 13:29.476
But l said to myself, ''Jackie Bisset,
nothing like this will happen again.''

13:29.654 --> 13:35.412
So l kissed my dog, Smiley, and waved
goodbye to my pa, and here l am.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.288
Knock it off!

13:39.669 --> 13:41.711
You don't talk like that.

13:41.882 --> 13:47.888
Listen, l know this whole thing's been
handled in a very stupid way.

13:48.058 --> 13:50.265
But l really am in a jam here.

13:51.271 --> 13:54.227
l tell you what,
we promised you a guided tour,

13:54.402 --> 13:59.398
why don't l show you the sights,
and l'll explain my whole story.

13:59.576 --> 14:04.372
l know where to start, City Hall. lt's
historic and we'll get a marriage licence.

14:04.543 --> 14:08.209
- l really don't think so, no.
- Come on.

14:08.382 --> 14:12.845
Why not? You have a chance to help
one of the greatest guys in the world.

14:13.014 --> 14:16.635
- l barely know him.
- Let me fill you in.

14:16.813 --> 14:20.978
Anybody here would do anything
for this guy. Right?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.980
That's right.

14:23.156 --> 14:29.163
Look, look.
Just hear him out, please, all right?

14:30.376 --> 14:34.505
l never have been to Boston.
l always wanted to see it.

14:36.135 --> 14:40.930
l tell you what, you tell me your story
and l'll think about it.

14:41.101 --> 14:45.599
You got a deal. You'll love this,
the Sam Malone pre-nuptial tour.

14:45.774 --> 14:49.147
We'll start of with the USS Constitution,

14:49.323 --> 14:52.528
then we'll go to the Old North Church,
Paul Revere's house,

14:52.703 --> 14:57.450
and then we'll top it off
with the traditional Boston blood test.

14:59.963 --> 15:04.379
- All those places are in Boston?
- Yes, Norman.

15:04.554 --> 15:08.555
This town is a treasure-trove
of historical monuments.

15:08.728 --> 15:10.768
That's really something.

15:10.939 --> 15:14.227
Thousands of people flock to Boston
to see all those sights,

15:14.404 --> 15:16.813
and soak up a lot of American heritage,

15:16.991 --> 15:20.575
and l sit here in a bar,
night after night, guzzling beer.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.836
- lt's sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

15:25.004 --> 15:27.331
But, hey, no one's forcing them.

15:36.982 --> 15:38.725
lt's getting late.

15:38.900 --> 15:42.069
Sammy must be having a hard time
talking Jackie into it.

15:42.240 --> 15:47.154
Yes, and if he doesn't get back
in a year, his cologne will wear off.

15:47.332 --> 15:49.741
l don't know why he's going
to this trouble.

15:49.919 --> 15:52.492
l discussed this case
with my law professor.

15:52.673 --> 15:56.341
Was that before he scratched himself
and ate a banana?

15:56.513 --> 15:58.755
Are you calling him an ape?

15:58.933 --> 16:05.686
You know something, one of these days
l'm going to... l don't know what.

16:05.860 --> 16:09.481
That man would be magnificent
in front of a jury.

16:09.658 --> 16:15.166
Sam, thank you so much. That was
the most fun day of my whole life.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.835
l'm glad you enjoyed it.
Sit down, l'll make you a cup of tea.

16:19.006 --> 16:22.128
Boston is such a lovely city.

16:22.304 --> 16:26.386
When we were on the Constitution,
somebody recognised Sam.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.349
l didn't know he was a celebrity.

16:29.523 --> 16:34.353
Cut the chit chat. ls Mammy Yokum
going to marry you or not?

16:35.366 --> 16:38.202
Well, she hasn't decided.

16:38.370 --> 16:42.241
- What do you say, Jackie?
- l don't know.

16:42.419 --> 16:49.304
Sam, l always thought my wedding day
would be beautiful and special.

16:49.471 --> 16:53.056
lt will be. We'll get a minister
and have it right here.

16:53.227 --> 16:55.767
You think that's beautiful and special?

16:55.940 --> 16:58.479
Maybe you're asking the wrong guy.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.855
lt's quarter to twelve,
l don't have much time.

17:03.035 --> 17:06.785
Either you say yes now
or l'll have to think of something else.

17:06.957 --> 17:09.829
And he's already thought once today.

17:10.003 --> 17:16.176
- This is all happening so fast.
- Fast? lt's been eight hours.

17:16.348 --> 17:20.727
By the time l knew my ex-husband
that long, he'd already cheated on me.

17:21.606 --> 17:23.398
Well...

17:23.568 --> 17:27.948
l was always raised to believe
you should help people when you can.

17:29.201 --> 17:31.575
l'm getting married!

17:34.585 --> 17:38.666
Do you mind if l call home first?
l'd like to tell my pa about it.

17:38.841 --> 17:41.002
Sure, come into my office here.

17:41.178 --> 17:44.265
And don't forget to tell Billy-Joe-Bob-Jim.

17:45.435 --> 17:48.937
Don't take too long,
we don't have much time. Oh, boy.

17:50.152 --> 17:54.233
- Sam, l have dire news.
- Good or bad?

17:58.415 --> 18:02.415
That was Justice Fiedler's secretary.
He's running a little late.

18:02.588 --> 18:06.255
- What has he got to do?
- Well, his wife is having a baby.

18:06.427 --> 18:10.048
So? His work was finished
a long time ago.

18:10.224 --> 18:14.724
l'm sorry, but what do l do now? We
don't have time to call someone else.

18:14.899 --> 18:19.195
lt's not as though we have Justices
of the Peace and ministers in here.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.441
Don't be too sure, my son.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.412
- You, Norman?
- Yeah.

18:25.584 --> 18:31.174
ln the '50s l sent a dollar to a church
advertising in ''Rolling Stone''.

18:32.010 --> 18:36.971
l'm an official minister
of the Church of the Living Desert.

18:38.020 --> 18:42.150
- Did you want to get out of the draft?
- No, we were just goofing around.

18:42.318 --> 18:47.362
We were at the accounting club, getting
high smelling adding machine ribbons.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.658
lt seemed funny, l don't know.

18:49.829 --> 18:54.043
ln that mindless state
even this business used to seem funny.

18:58.344 --> 19:01.096
- lt reminded me of something else.
- Hello.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.674
Oh, Justice Fiedler!

19:03.852 --> 19:08.432
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Sorry l'm late, l just became a father.

19:08.609 --> 19:13.986
We're all thrilled now get your buns
over here. We only have a few minutes.

19:14.159 --> 19:17.115
- Carla, stay out of this.
- Here's your pulpit.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.828
We are in a hurry.
Could you do this quickly?

19:20.002 --> 19:26.010
Yes, l see there's a certain urgency.
By the way, it's a boy. Nine pounds!

19:26.179 --> 19:29.016
Just what the world needed.

19:29.184 --> 19:32.389
- Hello, everybody.
- You're just in time, Eddie,

19:32.565 --> 19:35.235
for my wedding to Jacqueline Bisset.

19:35.402 --> 19:38.191
- Don't make me laugh.
- Come here.

19:39.950 --> 19:45.790
- See her, the girl on the phone?
- Wow, Jacqueline Bisset.

19:45.962 --> 19:48.203
What happened to her?

19:48.380 --> 19:51.336
lt's not the movie star, Eddie.

19:51.511 --> 19:55.926
The bet was Jacqueline Bisset and
that's her name. She's got lD to prove it.

19:56.102 --> 19:59.520
- What is this, a trick?
- No, he's winning the bet.

19:59.691 --> 20:03.192
Why don't you call Sam the winner
and forget the whole thing?

20:03.363 --> 20:05.820
- You're going to marry her?
- You bet.

20:05.993 --> 20:11.619
- This is JP Fiedler.
- Yes, and father of the miracle baby.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.082
Give it a rest, will you?

20:14.255 --> 20:17.709
l don't know if it's necessary
for you to go to all this trouble.

20:17.887 --> 20:22.218
- Are you calling the bet off?
- No, he has an arrangement in mind.

20:22.394 --> 20:25.646
That's right.
Maybe we can work out a settlement.

20:25.816 --> 20:29.352
- That's what you've been after all along.
- Quiet, blondie!

20:29.530 --> 20:31.524
Yeah.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.904
This is between us men of the world.

20:35.081 --> 20:39.662
l'll consider dropping the whole matter
for maybe...five grand.

20:40.756 --> 20:44.673
- You'll get nothing from me, Eddie.
- All right, Sam.

20:44.846 --> 20:49.427
l'll consider it square if you give me
and a date free drinks for life.

20:49.603 --> 20:51.432
- No.
- Do it, Sam.

20:51.607 --> 20:55.392
l'd like to see
what would go out with him.

20:55.571 --> 20:58.609
Besides me, l mean.

20:58.785 --> 21:01.703
Well, he kinda grows on you.

21:01.872 --> 21:04.828
- Free drinks for the rest of the year?
- No.

21:05.003 --> 21:07.578
One on the house?

21:07.757 --> 21:11.010
- Not a chance.
- Gee, come on, Sam.

21:11.179 --> 21:14.596
How about one of those olives
with the pimento in?

21:17.189 --> 21:22.613
You think about this the next time
you shoot your mouth off in some bar.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.038
Drinks on the house!

21:33.674 --> 21:36.297
You see, l always land on my feet.

21:36.470 --> 21:39.045
Sometimes on somebody else's.

21:39.225 --> 21:42.227
You've thought about
what you've done to that girl?

21:42.396 --> 21:46.099
- Which one?
- Jackie.

21:46.277 --> 21:49.612
That's right,
she still thinks we're getting married.

21:49.782 --> 21:56.500
- She didn't want to do it anyway.
- Did you see the look on her face?

21:56.668 --> 21:59.956
She's a simple girl
from a rural environment

22:00.132 --> 22:03.218
who finds herself in the city
being entertained by a...

22:03.387 --> 22:08.266
...slightly attractive semi-celebrity.
How could her head not be turned?

22:08.437 --> 22:12.140
Yeah, maybe you're right.
You think l laid on the charm too thick?

22:13.362 --> 22:17.943
Yes, but she's a farm girl, she's
used to stepping around such things.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.741
Sam, guess what?
l told my pa all about this,

22:23.920 --> 22:28.714
and he's a baseball fan
and he remembers you, sort of.

22:28.885 --> 22:31.640
That was the kind of player l was.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.430
- lsn't that great?
- Yeah.

22:34.603 --> 22:38.900
- Yeah! Boy, this will be sticky.
- What are we waiting for?

22:39.069 --> 22:44.493
You know... Will you do this?
You're a little smarter than me.

22:44.662 --> 22:47.201
l'm a lot smarter than you are.

22:47.374 --> 22:50.127
This paper napkin is a little smarter.

22:55.177 --> 22:59.179
- Jackie, there'll be no wedding today.
- What about the bet?

22:59.352 --> 23:02.520
The bet was called off.
Sam gets to keep his bar.

23:02.690 --> 23:06.642
- Oh... Well, that's good.
- Yes.

23:06.822 --> 23:10.904
Let's be honest.
Weren't you falling for Sam just a little?

23:11.078 --> 23:16.503
- Sam? No!
- Come on, he's a very attractive man.

23:16.671 --> 23:21.169
Almost as attractive as he thinks he is.

23:21.345 --> 23:27.018
He only stopped complementing himself
once, to ask if l wanted to.

23:27.187 --> 23:31.437
- l like you.
- l like you, too, Diane.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.650
Say, you must see the girls
Sam goes out with.

23:34.824 --> 23:38.611
What sort of girl would fall for Sam?

23:40.918 --> 23:43.041
Pathetic wretches.

23:43.212 --> 23:46.465
lt would have to be someone
lacking in self-respect,

23:46.635 --> 23:49.388
as shallow as he is
and as empty-headed.

23:49.555 --> 23:51.135
Amen.

23:52.102 --> 23:57.941
ls Diane making you feel
a little bit better about what happened?

23:58.112 --> 24:01.399
- Yes, she is.
- Good. She'd be the one to understand.

24:01.576 --> 24:03.699
You know, this little filly and l...

24:07.502 --> 24:10.706
- More tea?
- Thank you.
