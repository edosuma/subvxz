Hi.

01:19.661 --> 01:22.371
<i>HeY-</i>

01:22.372 --> 01:23.705
What can I get you?

01:23.706 --> 01:27.709
Well, um, lwas thinking about...

01:27.710 --> 01:29.002
<i>the...</i>

01:29.003 --> 01:32.756
Turkey sandwich?

01:32.757 --> 01:37.757
Just guessing.

01:41.891 --> 01:43.976
Iced tea?

01:43.977 --> 01:44.977
That's right.

01:47.981 --> 01:52.981
Can I get you something else?

01:53.987 --> 01:55.070
No. No, I'm good.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.071
Thanks.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.239
Okay.

01:57.240 --> 02:02.240
You know, I... I was wondering...

02:03.621 --> 02:05.247
Yes?

02:05.248 --> 02:08.417
It's been weeks now,
me coming here, and...

02:08.418 --> 02:11.086
and, <i>um...</i>

02:11.087 --> 02:14.339
I was thinking,
what if I come here tomorrow

02:14.340 --> 02:17.259
and you're no longer here?

02:17.260 --> 02:22.014
Well, I mean, lwasn't planning
on spending the rest of my life here,

02:22.015 --> 02:24.057
- right? I mean...
- You see? That's my point.

02:24.058 --> 02:25.475
You know?

02:25.476 --> 02:29.521
Uh, what if you leave
and I never find out your...

02:29.522 --> 02:31.148
your favorite ice cream

02:31.149 --> 02:32.899
or your favorite movie,

02:32.900 --> 02:34.484
stuff like that?

02:34.485 --> 02:36.695
My favorite movie's "Fight Club."

02:36.696 --> 02:39.990
My favorite ice cream is chocolate.

02:39.991 --> 02:44.991
Do you want to go out
with me sometime?

03:26.496 --> 03:27.954
Yeah, hello.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.376
Ellen.

03:32.377 --> 03:33.460
What?

03:33.461 --> 03:35.587
[crying 1.

03:35.588 --> 03:37.923
What happened?

04:24.262 --> 04:29.262
Who are you looking for?

04:30.268 --> 04:33.562
Number 12.

04:33.563 --> 04:38.563
It's right next door.

04:51.998 --> 04:52.498
Sarah?

05:13.311 --> 05:13.811
Shit.

05:18.316 --> 05:20.901
Sarah?

05:30.703 --> 05:33.205
Oh, my God.

05:33.206 --> 05:38.206
I thought that was you.

05:38.461 --> 05:42.005
What's going on here?

05:42.006 --> 05:45.842
Are you all right?

05:45.843 --> 05:48.345
Ellen. She's dead.

05:48.346 --> 05:50.555
We gotta get out of here. Now!

05:50.556 --> 05:51.807
Look, we gotta get your stuff!

05:51.808 --> 05:52.420
Let's go.

06:02.777 --> 06:06.571
I should go to the police.

06:06.572 --> 06:10.700
They're probably already there.

06:10.701 --> 06:15.701
Maybe we should split town for a while.

06:20.253 --> 06:21.753
Here.

06:21.754 --> 06:23.880
Have a coffee, a muffin.

06:23.881 --> 06:27.968
It'll help you feel better.

06:27.969 --> 06:30.846
The girl is Ellen,

06:30.847 --> 06:33.139
my roommate.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.142
She was on her own.

06:36.143 --> 06:38.812
She'd lost her parents
a couple years ago

06:38.813 --> 06:43.813
in some accident,
fell into drugs.

06:46.112 --> 06:49.573
We got into a fight...

06:49.574 --> 06:53.410
because I asked her
not to get loaded around me.

06:53.411 --> 06:55.579
A couple hours later,

06:55.580 --> 06:59.875
I heard her fighting
with the guy next door, Eddie,

06:59.876 --> 07:02.294
her dealer.

07:02.295 --> 07:06.089
And then it stopped.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.133
And I saw her...

07:08.134 --> 07:11.469
on the couch sleeping.

07:11.470 --> 07:16.470
Only, she wasn't breathing.

07:19.437 --> 07:24.024
I don't do that anymore.

07:24.025 --> 07:24.525
Okay.

07:36.579 --> 07:39.372
Thank you for last night.

07:39.373 --> 07:44.373
It really meant a lot to me.

07:45.838 --> 07:48.006
<i>You don't...</i>

07:48.007 --> 07:52.260
think I'm trash?

07:52.261 --> 07:55.472
Everybody's got a story.

07:55.473 --> 07:59.976
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.

07:59.977 --> 08:00.477
Okay.

08:14.909 --> 08:16.952
This is not my stuff.

08:16.953 --> 08:18.745

09:13.759 --> 09:14.843
Let me see.

09:14.844 --> 09:19.264
Uh, I don't know about this.

09:19.265 --> 09:24.060
It ju... lt feels like...

09:24.061 --> 09:25.687
trespassing.

09:25.688 --> 09:30.688
I just want to see something.

09:38.159 --> 09:40.827
Unbelievable.

09:40.828 --> 09:44.164
I mean, you guys could be twins.

09:44.165 --> 09:46.624
<i>We are one strike</i> away.

09:51.756 --> 09:53.173
What?

09:53.174 --> 09:55.258
It's... lt's a bit crazy,

09:55.259 --> 09:56.634
but it could work.

09:56.635 --> 09:58.970
<i>Nobody on. A perfect game.</i>

09:58.971 --> 10:02.932
I think we should contact that lawyer.

Hi. This is Ellen Niles.

10:14.153 --> 10:16.863
I received your letter
and wanted to let you know

10:16.864 --> 10:19.574
that I'm on my way down to Texas.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.160
I'll be in touch when I get there.

10:22.161 --> 10:23.620
Thank you.

12:04.138 --> 12:08.391
This is nuts.

12:08.392 --> 12:09.851
Don't worry.

12:11.312 --> 12:16.312
We're gonna be fine.

13:07.952 --> 13:10.745
My name is Ellen Niles.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.831
I'm 21 years old,

13:13.832 --> 13:17.126
visited my late Uncle Zachary once,
almost 15 years ago.

13:17.127 --> 13:20.338
I was real young,
so I don't really remember much.

13:20.339 --> 13:23.341
Why did Niles
leave all his cash to Ellen,

13:23.342 --> 13:25.093
to you?

13:25.094 --> 13:27.762
He didn't have any kids of his own.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.764
Besides my parents,
who passed away,

13:29.765 --> 13:31.516
I'm his only living relative.

13:31.517 --> 13:34.060
How did Niles get so rich?

13:34.061 --> 13:39.061
My grandfather was a lawyer
and developer in Pasadena.

13:39.275 --> 13:41.234
Very good.

13:47.533 --> 13:52.533
And I like that.

14:04.717 --> 14:07.051
How do you do? You must be...

14:07.052 --> 14:09.178
Billy. Ellen's friend.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.055
Cameron Brogden.

14:11.056 --> 14:12.640
Good to meet you.

14:12.641 --> 14:17.641
- Please.
- Thank you.

14:17.855 --> 14:21.357
Okay, you just need
to sign right there.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.484
Oh, oh,
first I'm gonna need to see

14:23.485 --> 14:25.695
- some picture l.D.
- Oh, sure.

14:25.696 --> 14:28.531
You know, a driver's license, birth cert,
passport, something like that.

14:28.532 --> 14:30.742
It's just a formality.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.416
Okay.

14:38.417 --> 14:39.542
Heh.

14:39.543 --> 14:44.543
If you could sign right there.

14:50.012 --> 14:53.181
Well, should I show you
around the property?

14:53.182 --> 14:54.682
Sure. All right.

15:00.689 --> 15:02.774
I have a question.

15:02.775 --> 15:05.651
What kind of money
are we talking about?

15:05.652 --> 15:09.989
Well, let's just say
your uncle was a prominent man.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.992
We're talking in
the seven-figure range.

15:12.993 --> 15:13.993
Oh.

15:24.296 --> 15:27.840
We just walk over to that hill...

15:27.841 --> 15:30.635
you can get a view of the whole place.

15:30.636 --> 15:35.636
Right over there,
that's God's country.

15:38.560 --> 15:43.560
See that second ridge,
right there?

15:44.066 --> 15:46.109
Right along there,
that's the border,

15:46.110 --> 15:50.655
the second ridge,
and it goes all the way around.

15:52.157 --> 15:54.867
What's that turned-over tractor
doing there?

15:54.868 --> 15:56.202
Oh.

15:56.203 --> 15:58.121
Oh, that's...

15:58.122 --> 16:01.082
That's where your uncle
met his demise.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.708
What happened?

16:02.709 --> 16:03.793
<i>Well...</i>

16:03.794 --> 16:06.045
nobody knows for sure,
you know,

16:06.046 --> 16:07.588
but maybe the heat was a factor.

16:07.589 --> 16:09.632
It was over 100 degrees that day.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.175
He flipped the tractor.

16:11.176 --> 16:14.345
He must have hit his head.

16:14.346 --> 16:17.849
Thanks for your time, folks.

16:17.850 --> 16:20.601
I'm real sorry about your loss.

16:20.602 --> 16:21.894
Thanks.

16:21.895 --> 16:26.895
I'll try and do my best to make things
as easy as possible for you.

16:26.942 --> 16:31.942
You two have a good evening.

16:37.995 --> 16:40.830
That guy makes me nervous.

16:40.831 --> 16:43.499
You did great,

16:43.500 --> 16:48.500
except you shouldn't have pushed
so hard about the old man's money.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.383
Everything all right
with you boys?

16:52.384 --> 16:55.052
Well, everything's fine
now that you're here.

16:55.053 --> 16:56.387
Huh.

16:56.388 --> 16:59.474
Call me if you need anything.

16:59.475 --> 17:03.436
All right. We Will.

17:03.437 --> 17:05.980
That cookie pusher's
got the hots for you, little brother.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.898
Please. Heh heh.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.234
Foreigners mention what they were
gonna do with the inheritance?

17:11.236 --> 17:16.156
Mm. Didn't say.

17:16.157 --> 17:18.534
Don't it strike you
the least bit strange

17:18.535 --> 17:23.122
that he leaves all that scratch
to some girl he barely knew?

17:23.123 --> 17:25.374
No.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.710
It's called inheritance, Bob.

17:27.711 --> 17:29.629
She's entitled to it, by birth.

17:29.630 --> 17:31.464
I know what the word
"inheritance" means.

17:31.465 --> 17:32.757
<i>Well...</i>

17:32.758 --> 17:36.385
Anyway, I gotta finish up
another report.

17:36.386 --> 17:39.847
Burglary yesterday
over at the Lazy Inn.

17:39.848 --> 17:42.642
Sounds like you got
a crime wave on your hands.

17:42.643 --> 17:47.643
Yeah. All started up
since Niles kicked.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.150
Hey, how about leaving me
some scratch for this?

17:51.151 --> 17:52.693
No!

17:52.694 --> 17:53.945
That's on you, bro.

17:53.946 --> 17:58.946
It was on me yesterday!

18:40.242 --> 18:43.494
<i>J' Sweet smell of perfume J'.</i>

18:43.495 --> 18:48.495
<i>J' Fading fast J'.</i>

19:00.178 --> 19:02.305
<i>J' Say you love me, too... J'.</i>

19:02.306 --> 19:04.015
Sarah?

19:04.016 --> 19:07.893
- <i>I'm in</i> here.
- <i>J' I feel like</i> a <i>fool J'.</i>

19:07.894 --> 19:11.272
<i>J' For thinking about J'.</i>

19:11.273 --> 19:16.068
<i>J' Having you... J'.</i>

19:16.069 --> 19:17.862
What is it?

19:17.863 --> 19:19.196
They're letters,

19:19.197 --> 19:21.115
love letters from...

19:21.116 --> 19:23.326
from some woman.

19:23.327 --> 19:25.244
How romantic.

19:25.245 --> 19:26.912
I found a fancy painting.

19:26.913 --> 19:28.164
Listen to this.

19:28.165 --> 19:31.500
"L know in my heart this child is ours,

19:31.501 --> 19:32.960
"no matter what you say.

19:32.961 --> 19:35.296
"L beg you to acknowledge your son,

19:35.297 --> 19:39.175
who, in your heart,
you must know is yours."

19:39.176 --> 19:40.635
The last thing we need
is someone else

19:40.636 --> 19:42.970
thinking they can
get in on the money.

19:54.316 --> 19:59.316
Hurry up, fat man.

20:20.759 --> 20:22.510
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

20:22.511 --> 20:27.511
Come back here! Hey!

20:33.730 --> 20:36.357
Whoa!

20:36.358 --> 20:37.441
Look at this thing.

20:37.442 --> 20:40.111
Whoa.

20:40.112 --> 20:41.487
It's a hunting rifle.

20:41.488 --> 20:46.488
Be careful.

20:48.995 --> 20:51.288
Put it away.

20:51.289 --> 20:51.789
Please?

21:28.952 --> 21:30.161
It's okay.

21:30.162 --> 21:31.746
Did we shoot somebody?

21:31.747 --> 21:36.747
Oh, my God.

22:27.844 --> 22:31.597
<i>HEY! HEY, hey, hombre!</i>

22:31.598 --> 22:34.183
Had a small accident.

22:34.184 --> 22:39.184
Need a lift into town.

22:53.119 --> 22:55.704
Thank God you're back.

22:55.705 --> 22:58.541
I was so worried.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.251
I looked everywhere.

23:00.252 --> 23:01.585
Whoever it was...

23:01.586 --> 23:06.173
disappeared.

23:06.174 --> 23:07.508
You didn't, uh,

23:07.509 --> 23:12.012
tell anybody about us
coming here, did you?

23:12.013 --> 23:13.764
What?

23:18.270 --> 23:20.312
I can't believe you would
even ask me that.

23:20.313 --> 23:22.898
Okay. Okay. Sorry.

23:33.201 --> 23:35.578
But what about the car?

23:35.579 --> 23:38.163
I mean, somebody is gonna
be looking for that.

23:38.164 --> 23:43.164
What do you want me to do?
Call the cops?

23:45.672 --> 23:47.339
I wouldn't worry about it.

23:47.340 --> 23:52.340
I'll make sure nobody'll find it.

23:53.471 --> 23:57.308
Anyway, I pushed the El Camino
to the old barn

23:57.309 --> 24:00.060
next to Niles' Caddy.

24:03.106 --> 24:06.108
We haven't had nothin'
like this for a while, Sal.

24:06.109 --> 24:07.568
- Where'd it happen?
- I know.

24:07.569 --> 24:09.320
Right out front, sheriff.
Right here.

24:09.321 --> 24:11.488
You got that report I asked for?

24:11.489 --> 24:15.117
Yes, sir.

24:15.118 --> 24:17.161
I saw him, Bob.

24:17.162 --> 24:19.288
Must've been a city hoodlum,

24:19.289 --> 24:22.291
'cause he got in there
and hot-wired that sum-bitch

24:22.292 --> 24:24.126
in less than two seconds.

24:24.127 --> 24:27.296
'67 blue El Camino, right, Sal?

24:27.297 --> 24:29.298
License plate Q74436?

24:29.299 --> 24:30.799
That is correct, sir.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.886
And you could identify him
if you saw him again?

24:33.887 --> 24:36.597
Sure as the sun beatin' down
on this place tomorrow.

24:36.598 --> 24:38.057
Will heat it t0110.

24:38.058 --> 24:41.644
<i>J' Ain't no doubt about it... J'</i>

24:41.645 --> 24:44.021
I'm gonna call in a sketch artist.

24:44.022 --> 24:46.732
I know every badge
for five counties.

24:46.733 --> 24:51.733
We'll get your truck back.
Don't you worry, Sal.

25:03.583 --> 25:06.669
Hello.

25:06.670 --> 25:07.711
Hi.

25:07.712 --> 25:11.757
Um, my name is Belle.

25:11.758 --> 25:15.386
I used to be Mr. Niles' housekeeper.

25:15.387 --> 25:16.387
I'm Billy,

25:16.388 --> 25:17.930
Ellen's boyfriend.

25:17.931 --> 25:19.390
Hi, Billy.

25:19.391 --> 25:20.724
You have a seat.

25:20.725 --> 25:21.725
Thank you.

25:21.726 --> 25:22.726
You're welcome.

25:22.727 --> 25:24.520
What can I do for you?

25:24.521 --> 25:29.521
I... I baby-sat for Mr. Niles, years ago,
when Ellen was visiting.

25:30.527 --> 25:33.237
I bet she'll remember me.
Heh heh.

25:33.238 --> 25:34.947
Ellen's asleep.

25:34.948 --> 25:36.365
Oh.

25:36.366 --> 25:38.075
The heat, you know.

25:38.076 --> 25:41.078
I've been coming here
for more than 40 years,

25:41.079 --> 25:44.498
keeping this place tidy.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.208
I, uh, wouldn't mind

25:46.209 --> 25:51.209
keeping the place clean
for you, too.

25:53.258 --> 25:54.717
That's very kind.

25:54.718 --> 25:59.638
We're not gonna be here
for that much longer.

26:34.924 --> 26:38.594
Howdy.

26:38.595 --> 26:39.845
Sheriff Robert Brogden.

26:39.846 --> 26:42.723
Nice to make your acquaintance.

26:42.724 --> 26:44.224
What can I do for you?

26:44.225 --> 26:46.935
Well, me and Deputy Fenway here
are looking for a stolen car,

26:46.936 --> 26:49.104
an old El Camino,

26:49.105 --> 26:51.482
blue, metallic.

26:51.483 --> 26:55.194
Don't suppose y'all know
something about it?

26:55.195 --> 26:56.320
Sorry. We, uh...

26:56.321 --> 26:58.530
We just arrived from out of town.

26:58.531 --> 27:00.866
Ah.

27:00.867 --> 27:02.076
Excuse me.

27:02.077 --> 27:04.578
Of course.

27:04.579 --> 27:07.331
Yeah, sometimes kids'll
take a car out for a joy ride

27:07.332 --> 27:10.667
and then dump it in the fields.

27:10.668 --> 27:15.172
I wish I could help,
but I haven't seen it.

27:15.173 --> 27:20.173
You don't mind if we look around
the property, do you?

27:21.930 --> 27:26.930
No, not at all.

27:32.732 --> 27:34.733
You get them pictures?

27:34.734 --> 27:35.859
Oh, yeah.

27:35.860 --> 27:38.028
What exactly are you up to, boss?

27:38.029 --> 27:40.364
Just keep your eyes
and ears open, Earl.

27:40.365 --> 27:41.990
My daddy always taught me to check

27:41.991 --> 27:46.991
where you least expect
to find anything.

27:54.462 --> 27:59.462
What about that barn?

28:00.009 --> 28:01.927
What are you doing?

28:01.928 --> 28:04.888
We cannot afford to let
that hillbilly arrest us.

28:04.889 --> 28:09.889
You're crazy.

28:22.448 --> 28:22.948
Honey?

28:27.287 --> 28:32.287
Bob? What are you doing
bothering these nice young people?

28:38.965 --> 28:41.008
Not bothering a soul.

28:41.009 --> 28:46.009
Ha ha. You need a search warrant
to search people's property.

28:47.473 --> 28:52.473
What would I do without you,
little bro?

28:57.233 --> 29:02.233
I've enjoyed about as much
of this as I can stand.

29:03.406 --> 29:03.906
Earl.

29:16.544 --> 29:20.255
I'm so sorry about
my overzealous brother.

29:20.256 --> 29:23.467
He's, uh, been like that
since we were kids.

29:23.468 --> 29:24.551
Brothers?

29:24.552 --> 29:26.094
- Yeah.
- I had no idea.

29:26.095 --> 29:27.846
Robert Brogden, Sr., our daddy,

29:27.847 --> 29:30.432
was sheriff for two decades
before him. Heh heh heh.

29:30.433 --> 29:31.934
Is that right?

29:31.935 --> 29:33.852
He's just a little bit unsettled

29:33.853 --> 29:36.396
because there's been
a rash of crime lately.

29:36.397 --> 29:38.273
And, uh, Tremo's a small town.

29:38.274 --> 29:40.776
Drunk teenagers
'bout the worst thing we get.

29:40.777 --> 29:42.736
AnyWaY...

29:42.737 --> 29:46.990
there's been a little hiccup
in your case.

29:46.991 --> 29:47.991
A hiccup?

29:47.992 --> 29:50.494
Mm-hmm.

29:50.495 --> 29:54.122
Somebody has filed an injunction.

29:54.123 --> 29:56.959
An... An injunction?

29:56.960 --> 29:58.001
Who?

29:58.002 --> 29:59.461
I don't know.

29:59.462 --> 30:02.047
Some guy's claiming
he's Niles' son.

30:02.048 --> 30:03.882
I don't get it.

30:03.883 --> 30:07.135
Doesn't the will
leave everything to me?

30:07.136 --> 30:08.595
Yes, it does.

30:08.596 --> 30:11.723
However, if Niles
didn't know he had a son

30:11.724 --> 30:14.726
and then suddenly
he found out about this son

30:14.727 --> 30:17.229
and if this son
could somehow prove

30:17.230 --> 30:20.607
that Niles was in the middle <i>of...</i>

30:20.608 --> 30:23.860
changing his will to include his son,

30:23.861 --> 30:26.446
well, that wouldn't be good.

30:26.447 --> 30:30.784
However, if we could prove that
while Niles knew he had this son,

30:30.785 --> 30:35.122
he still wasn't gonna
leave him nothin'...

30:35.123 --> 30:36.540
that would be better.

30:36.541 --> 30:38.750
Uh, would you excuse me
for a second?

30:38.751 --> 30:39.751
Sure.

30:39.752 --> 30:40.252
Thanks.

31:01.983 --> 31:02.983
What's this?

31:02.984 --> 31:07.984
I found this a few days ago.

31:25.631 --> 31:29.676
This is very telling.

31:29.677 --> 31:31.887
I'm glad you showed this to me.

31:31.888 --> 31:35.599
This will definitely help your case.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.019
But you still gonna
need something more.

31:39.020 --> 31:39.520
More?

31:43.649 --> 31:46.401
This isn't his letter.

31:46.402 --> 31:49.488
What you need is
something written by him,

31:49.489 --> 31:52.491
that says all of his estate
goes to Ellen,

31:52.492 --> 31:54.576
despite any other claims.

31:54.577 --> 31:56.953
What, uh...

31:56.954 --> 32:01.333
What are the odds of finding that?

32:01.334 --> 32:04.878
You know what?
There's no reason to get...

32:04.879 --> 32:06.505
too concerned.

32:06.506 --> 32:10.258
When I think about it,
the burden of proof

32:10.259 --> 32:15.013
is gonna be on this rival party.

32:15.014 --> 32:17.974
<i>It'sjust, uh...</i>

32:17.975 --> 32:20.936
it's just gonna take a little more time,

32:20.937 --> 32:24.481
and round here,
we ain't got nothin' but time.

32:24.482 --> 32:29.482
I think we should get out of here.

32:31.364 --> 32:35.659
Ellen's dead.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.454
We're stealing her money.

32:39.455 --> 32:44.455
Billy, nothing is right
about any of this.

32:44.544 --> 32:46.044
Look“.

32:46.045 --> 32:49.548
Hey, let's just stick
with this a little longer,

32:49.549 --> 32:54.469
and if it gets too dicey, we leave.

32:54.470 --> 32:59.470
What do you think?

32:59.892 --> 33:04.892
I think you're nuts.

33:15.533 --> 33:20.533
Did you hear that?

34:15.717 --> 34:16.330
Hey! Hey!

34:21.681 --> 34:26.681
Stay inside. Lock the door.

35:11.899 --> 35:13.817
<i>Ha ha ha.</i>

35:13.818 --> 35:18.818
<i>Your daddy?</i>

35:25.162 --> 35:28.498
<i>Yeah, that-a-boy, Jamie.</i>

35:28.499 --> 35:33.499
That-a-boy.

35:37.508 --> 35:41.720
<i>Who's your master?</i>

35:41.721 --> 35:42.221
<i>Go on.</i>

35:45.766 --> 35:48.393
<i>Go on now.</i>

35:48.394 --> 35:51.229
<i>You heard me.</i>

35:51.230 --> 35:55.317
<i>Are we having fun now, Zachary?</i>

36:11.959 --> 36:15.920
Start the car,
or I'll break your neck.

36:15.921 --> 36:20.216
It's your old pal, Eddie.

36:20.217 --> 36:22.886
You little bitch.

36:22.887 --> 36:25.305
That was me on the porch.

36:25.306 --> 36:29.142
That was me who took
a fucking bullet in the gut.

36:30.519 --> 36:35.519
I followed your ass
1,700 fucking miles.

36:35.900 --> 36:38.652
Your dead cunt friend Ellen,

36:38.653 --> 36:40.862
the one with the rich uncle,

36:40.863 --> 36:44.908
owes me a lot of cash.

36:44.909 --> 36:46.701
And guess what?

36:46.702 --> 36:50.455
You, little twit, will pay up.

36:50.456 --> 36:55.456
Do you understand?

36:56.295 --> 37:00.090
Question...

37:00.091 --> 37:05.091
What's the boyfriend's name?

37:08.349 --> 37:13.061
He's just a guy.

37:13.062 --> 37:16.606
He's nobody.

37:16.607 --> 37:18.900
Aah!

37:18.901 --> 37:20.485
What's the boyfriend's name?

37:20.486 --> 37:20.986
Billy.

37:24.782 --> 37:26.491
Billy.

37:26.492 --> 37:29.160
Okay.

37:29.161 --> 37:32.956
Now, you keep it nice and quiet

37:32.957 --> 37:35.917
about me bumping into you.

37:35.918 --> 37:39.295
Aah!

37:39.296 --> 37:41.256
Otherwise...

37:41.257 --> 37:45.510
Billy's the first one to go.

37:47.930 --> 37:52.930
I'm here to collect on Ellen's behalf.

37:54.145 --> 37:55.478
Soto speak.

37:55.479 --> 37:58.189
The lawyer said it'll be a few more days

37:58.190 --> 38:01.943
before he's gonna transfer the assets.

38:01.944 --> 38:05.822
And by the way,
I want my piece back.

38:05.823 --> 38:10.823
You could come by tomorrow,
room 212.

38:22.590 --> 38:26.384
Here's a little treat,
for old time's sake.

38:26.385 --> 38:30.805
You got a good scam going, Sarah.

38:30.806 --> 38:35.806
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:36.604 --> 38:39.272
A burglary? Jesus Christ.

38:39.273 --> 38:41.399
The guy broke
into the house last night.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.943
On his way out,
he dropped something,

38:43.944 --> 38:45.737
a DVD.

38:47.698 --> 38:50.658
I've seen... I've seen about...
just about enough of that.

38:50.659 --> 38:53.453
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go lie down.

38:53.454 --> 38:55.371
I'm not feeling too well.

38:55.372 --> 38:58.666
Well, I'm sorry to put you
through that, Ms. Niles.

38:58.667 --> 38:59.667
Not to worry.

38:59.668 --> 39:00.835
I'll talk to you later.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.465
I'm gonna get rid of this filth.

39:05.466 --> 39:08.718
I mean, Zachary Niles
has a respectable reputation.

39:08.719 --> 39:11.513
Its getting tainted now
is not gonna help our cause.

39:11.514 --> 39:13.723
You know what I'm saying?

39:13.724 --> 39:18.436
Would Niles being gay

39:18.437 --> 39:23.437
weaken the claims
of an illegitimate son?

39:23.484 --> 39:25.235
Not really.

39:25.236 --> 39:30.031
Men with homosexual tastes
fathering children...

39:30.032 --> 39:32.033
happens every day.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.786
- In your professional opinion...
- Mm-hmm.

39:34.787 --> 39:37.789
How much longer
is this whole ordeal gonna last?

39:37.790 --> 39:39.582
Well... Hmm.

39:39.583 --> 39:42.669
Once foul play is suspected,

39:42.670 --> 39:46.297
Texas probate courts will put
an immediate hold on this case.

39:46.298 --> 39:48.591
Eh, a month.

39:48.592 --> 39:50.134
Well, you know what?

39:50.135 --> 39:55.135
Probably closer to two.

39:58.352 --> 40:01.145
A month or two?

40:01.146 --> 40:02.772
Mm-hmm.

40:02.773 --> 40:07.694
I don't think
we could stay that long.

40:07.695 --> 40:10.071
Are you folks strapped for cash?

40:10.072 --> 40:12.156
'Cause you know I have
power of attorney.

40:12.157 --> 40:17.157
It wouldn't be improper for me
to forward Ellen some money.

40:18.289 --> 40:21.624
How much you have in mind?

40:21.625 --> 40:26.045
HOW 'bout $5,000?

40:26.046 --> 40:28.715
We'll wait.

40:28.716 --> 40:31.843
We'll wait for the settlement.

40:31.844 --> 40:35.013
Okay. Suit yourself.

40:35.014 --> 40:36.431
I gotta get 90mg-

40:36.432 --> 40:38.224
Well...

40:38.225 --> 40:39.893
Well, Billy,

40:39.894 --> 40:42.186
you know anything about art?

40:42.187 --> 40:44.230
No.

40:44.231 --> 40:48.902
Niles' taste in art was pretty eclectic.

40:48.903 --> 40:50.862
See this painting here?

40:50.863 --> 40:55.074
I believe he paid 135,000
for that one.

40:55.075 --> 40:58.328
You'd probably fetch twice that
at any art auction today.

40:58.329 --> 41:00.038
$135,000?

41:00.039 --> 41:01.789
- Mm-hmm.
- For this?

41:01.790 --> 41:03.124
Ha ha ha!

41:03.125 --> 41:05.418
Yep. Well...

41:05.419 --> 41:06.586
I hope, uh...

41:06.587 --> 41:08.046
I hope Ellen's feeling better.

41:08.047 --> 41:10.632
And, uh, trust me.

41:10.633 --> 41:13.801
It'll all work itself out.

41:13.802 --> 41:18.802
Have a good day.

41:21.268 --> 41:24.228
Anybody you recognizing?

41:24.229 --> 41:27.106
No, I ain't seen
the mean-looking one.

41:27.107 --> 41:28.149
Hmm.

41:28.150 --> 41:31.194
But I've seen them around.

41:31.195 --> 41:33.029
The lottery winners. Heh heh.

41:33.030 --> 41:34.781
Bob!

41:34.782 --> 41:37.408
What's on that pretty
little mind of yours?

41:37.409 --> 41:39.118
Is your brother seeing anyone?

41:39.119 --> 41:40.620
No.

41:40.621 --> 41:43.206
He's still Tremo's
most eligible bachelor.

41:43.207 --> 41:44.499
I'll mention you asked, though.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.334
I wish you would.

41:46.335 --> 41:50.296
I ain't seeing no one, Alice.

41:50.297 --> 41:52.507
I ain't teaching preschool.

41:52.508 --> 41:55.176
You don't know
what you're missing.

41:56.637 --> 42:01.182
Oh, I gotta go.

42:01.183 --> 42:04.686
I got something important
to relay to you, boss.

42:04.687 --> 42:05.979
What is it?

42:05.980 --> 42:09.816
They faxed over
the coroner's report.

42:09.817 --> 42:12.819
Rules out heat stroke
as the cause of death,

42:12.820 --> 42:17.323
said Niles died of suffocation.

42:19.243 --> 42:22.829
Now ain't that a pisser?

42:37.136 --> 42:42.136
Where have you been?

42:44.685 --> 42:48.229
You okay?

42:48.230 --> 42:53.230
You, uh... You seem...

42:55.320 --> 43:00.320
I hate this place.

43:21.180 --> 43:24.223
This time, we got a warrant.

43:24.224 --> 43:25.683
You got that right, Earl.

43:30.272 --> 43:35.272
What's he doing here?

43:44.369 --> 43:46.245
Folks.

43:46.246 --> 43:49.165
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

43:49.166 --> 43:50.625
What, um...

43:50.626 --> 43:52.418
What can we do for you, sheriff?

43:52.419 --> 43:56.756
I had a look at the coroner's report
concerning your uncle,

43:56.757 --> 44:00.510
and it appears he did not die
of natural causes.

44:00.511 --> 44:03.888
Suffocation seems to be
the cause of death.

44:03.889 --> 44:05.723
As of today, this plot of land's

44:05.724 --> 44:09.143
a crime scene,
a homicide investigation.

44:09.144 --> 44:11.604
Now, I'll notify Cameron.

44:11.605 --> 44:14.065
Meanwhile, we're gonna do
some dusting for fingerprints

44:14.066 --> 44:16.609
on your uncle's tractor.

44:16.610 --> 44:21.610
Mind if I come along?

44:23.075 --> 44:27.745
Be my guest.

44:51.603 --> 44:53.896
How we doing, boys? Any prints?

44:53.897 --> 44:56.440
Looks like we got
a whole bunch of clean ones.

44:56.441 --> 44:58.860
Good job.

44:58.861 --> 45:01.696
Son, you don't mind if we take
your fingerprints, do you?

45:01.697 --> 45:04.699
I'm talking you and Ms. Niles.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.325
You two could fall by the station

45:06.326 --> 45:09.245
first thing in the morning,
it'd be appreciated.

45:09.246 --> 45:10.788
Fingerprints?

45:10.789 --> 45:13.457
Yeah. It's a tradition
here in Tremo,

45:13.458 --> 45:17.670
kind of a keepsake
to remember you by.

45:17.671 --> 45:19.088
You got a lot of fucking nerve

45:19.089 --> 45:20.715
to show up here
in the middle of the night...

45:20.716 --> 45:22.842
Hey, don't get your panties
in an uproar, son.

45:22.843 --> 45:25.887
I'm just doing myjOb-

45:25.888 --> 45:29.807
You be there at 10 A.M. sharp.

45:29.808 --> 45:31.475
Have a good evening.

45:33.812 --> 45:35.313
Good work, boys!

45:38.233 --> 45:40.401
<i>This is easy listening,</i>

45:40.402 --> 45:43.362
<i>3 A.M. on the dot.</i>

45:43.363 --> 45:46.574
<i>In case you're hitting the road
early today, be careful.</i>

45:46.575 --> 45:48.743
<i>It's mighty breezy out there.</i>

45:48.744 --> 45:52.163
<i>Meanwhile,
here's some musical caffeine</i>

45:52.164 --> 45:55.416
<i>that'// get you going.</i>

45:55.417 --> 45:58.127
<i>J' They pulled up all their ties J'.</i>

45:58.128 --> 46:01.255
<i>J' And they were riding like</i> a <i>log J'.</i>

46:01.256 --> 46:04.383
<i>J' Got pennies in my pocket J'.</i>

46:04.384 --> 46:07.762
<i>J' When I thought I had some dimes J'.</i>

46:07.763 --> 46:10.598
<i>J' I guess everything happens J'.</i>

46:10.599 --> 46:14.018
<i>J' For</i> a <i>reason sometimes J'.</i>

46:14.019 --> 46:16.938
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

46:16.939 --> 46:20.316
<i>J' Been on 61 all day J'.</i>

46:20.317 --> 46:24.028
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

46:32.162 --> 46:37.162
<i>J' Trust in... J'.</i>

46:45.092 --> 46:47.009
Where were you two June 2?

46:47.010 --> 46:48.386
Bob!

46:48.387 --> 46:50.554
You are crossing the line.

46:50.555 --> 46:52.515
You don't have to answer that.

46:52.516 --> 46:54.642
Was that the day he was killed?

46:54.643 --> 46:57.061
Ellen and I were in L.A.
We can prove it, too.

46:57.062 --> 46:59.814
How much you think
old man Niles was worth, Billy?

46:59.815 --> 47:04.735
Okay, Robert, that's enough.

47:04.736 --> 47:09.736
We're all done here.

47:09.950 --> 47:11.993
<i>Nah...</i>

47:11.994 --> 47:13.577
People do some real crazy shit

47:13.578 --> 47:15.871
to get their hands
on a winning lottery ticket.

47:15.872 --> 47:17.206
Even a hick-town sheriff knows that.

47:17.207 --> 47:18.416
You know, right from the jump,

47:18.417 --> 47:19.625
I could tell that you, son,

47:19.626 --> 47:21.627
are nothin' but a bad piece of news.

47:21.628 --> 47:23.212
Oh, you could tell, huh?

47:23.213 --> 47:25.589
Listen, I know my rights.
Can I go now?

47:25.590 --> 47:26.924
I bet you do know your rights.

47:26.925 --> 47:29.135
I bet you've had a lot of scrapes
with the law.

47:29.136 --> 47:30.886
Ellen, Billy, you can go.

47:30.887 --> 47:33.514
It's my office, Cam,
my investigation!

47:33.515 --> 47:36.642
In case I haven't been clear,

47:36.643 --> 47:38.311
sooner or later,

47:38.312 --> 47:43.312
I'm gonna nail your maggot ass
to the wall.

47:47.279 --> 47:52.279
EnjQy your day.

47:56.121 --> 47:59.248
How to win friends.

47:59.249 --> 48:01.876
Heh heh heh.

48:04.379 --> 48:09.379
This whole thing
could take a while.

48:14.931 --> 48:19.352
No, you just have to tell that lawyer
of yours you need the money now.

48:19.353 --> 48:20.978
You're Ellen Niles.

48:20.979 --> 48:25.316
It's your money, darling, right?

48:25.317 --> 48:26.942
What if I can't?

48:26.943 --> 48:28.152
You can.

48:28.153 --> 48:33.153
You do as I say,
and all will be good.

48:36.953 --> 48:41.953
I better leave.

48:42.167 --> 48:44.627
Already?

48:44.628 --> 48:49.628
Let's play a little, hey?

49:00.185 --> 49:02.436
Stop.

49:02.437 --> 49:07.233
Don't fuck with <i>me...</i>

49:07.234 --> 49:12.234
you good-for-nothing crack bitch.

49:13.490 --> 49:18.452
Concentrate on transferring
some of them assets

49:18.453 --> 49:23.453
into my fucking wallet!

49:24.751 --> 49:28.838
Or I swear...

49:28.839 --> 49:33.839
I'll kill the both 0f you.

49:42.310 --> 49:47.310
You look pale.

49:53.989 --> 49:54.489
Thanks.

50:00.537 --> 50:05.082
You think I don't know
what's going on with you?

50:05.083 --> 50:06.542
What are you talking about?

50:06.543 --> 50:08.961
You're sleeping 14 hours a day.

50:08.962 --> 50:11.422
That's what I'm talking about.

50:11.423 --> 50:14.008
Listen to me. You need help.

50:14.009 --> 50:15.509
Hey, go back to L.A.

50:15.510 --> 50:17.720
Go to rehab if that's what it takes.

50:17.721 --> 50:19.805
I'll stay here,
and I'll get the money.

50:19.806 --> 50:21.807
Okay, then we can meet up
when I get back.

50:21.808 --> 50:23.017
Ha!

50:23.018 --> 50:25.853
And I can count on that?

50:25.854 --> 50:27.229
I take one look in your eyes,

50:27.230 --> 50:32.230
and I know exactly
what you've been doing.

50:32.486 --> 50:37.486
You think about what I'm saying,
unless you want to wind up like Ellen.

50:42.037 --> 50:47.037
You're wrong.

51:04.226 --> 51:09.226
"Sly Wheaton."

51:26.831 --> 51:29.291
Hi. William, I take it?

51:29.292 --> 51:30.584
That's me.

51:30.585 --> 51:32.253
You can call me Billy, if you want.

51:32.254 --> 51:36.799
Must be a lot of people
trying to horn in on the inheritance.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.676
What you drinking?

51:38.677 --> 51:40.886
I'm fine. Thanks.

51:42.305 --> 51:44.265
Ah, suit yourself.

51:44.266 --> 51:47.142
You don't mind if I do?

51:47.143 --> 51:48.894
See, I actually need some advice.

51:48.895 --> 51:50.729
I can pay you as soon as I can...

51:50.730 --> 51:54.483
I bet you can.

51:54.484 --> 51:56.652
Let's say...

51:56.653 --> 51:59.697
Suppose the old man
has an illegitimate child

51:59.698 --> 52:01.991
who was trying to get
some of his money.

52:01.992 --> 52:05.452
What would be
the quickest way to find a...

52:05.453 --> 52:08.038
some kind of solution?

52:08.039 --> 52:10.040
Solution?

52:10.041 --> 52:11.250
Listen.

52:11.251 --> 52:14.878
You need a document
stating that Niles

52:14.879 --> 52:17.673
wanted his money
going to his niece

52:17.674 --> 52:19.842
and his niece only.

52:19.843 --> 52:22.970
I don't have that document.

52:22.971 --> 52:26.765
Well, you got a problem then, don't you?

52:26.766 --> 52:30.144
Yeah, I'll bet Niles knew all about this,

52:30.145 --> 52:34.940
'cause he came to me two days
before he passed away.

52:34.941 --> 52:37.735
He was gonna have me change his will

52:37.736 --> 52:42.736
to explicitly exclude anyone but Ellen.

52:45.368 --> 52:48.287
Hmm.

52:48.288 --> 52:53.083
Kind of a coincidence,
don't you think?

52:53.084 --> 52:58.084
Niles ends up dead right before
he intends to change his will.

52:59.299 --> 53:01.967
Huh.

53:01.968 --> 53:06.968
You want that drink now?

53:28.536 --> 53:33.536
I guess I wasn't so wrong after all.

53:33.708 --> 53:37.586
Yeah, I found the pipe...

53:37.587 --> 53:42.587
in Ellen's s-stuff.

53:46.054 --> 53:48.389
You know, with...

53:48.390 --> 53:50.265
all this shit that we're dealing with,

53:50.266 --> 53:55.266
ljust feel like it would be okay...

53:55.480 --> 54:00.359
to have a little bit of fun.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.820
<i>J' I do believe... J'</i>

54:02.821 --> 54:06.198
I'm sorry.

54:06.199 --> 54:10.786
- I'll <i>stop.</i> I <i>promise.</i>
- <i>J' I do believe J'.</i>

54:10.787 --> 54:15.249
<i>J' Yeah, but your people down here J'.</i>

54:15.250 --> 54:17.918
<i>J' Did raise</i> a <i>fear J'.</i>

Jamie...

54:42.026 --> 54:44.445
pick up the phone.

54:44.446 --> 54:48.824
I gotta show you something.

54:48.825 --> 54:51.160
I'll be over in a few.

55:02.589 --> 55:04.298
No match.

55:04.299 --> 55:06.550
But do you remember that fella

55:06.551 --> 55:08.719
who used to work for Niles,
Jamie Albright?

55:08.720 --> 55:09.762
Mm-hmm.

55:09.763 --> 55:11.930
Turns out he had some priors,

55:11.931 --> 55:16.931
and his prints are as clear as day.

55:21.483 --> 55:23.025
Check this out.

55:23.026 --> 55:26.737
This rascal Billy
switched the DVD on me.

55:26.738 --> 55:29.615
Goddamn tractor infomercial.

55:29.616 --> 55:30.616

55:33.703 --> 55:37.581
don't talk!

55:37.582 --> 55:38.582
Idiot.

55:38.583 --> 55:40.751
If you'd not lost the video

55:40.752 --> 55:42.753
in Niles' driveway,

55:42.754 --> 55:47.754
it all would have been just fine.

55:56.810 --> 55:58.352
Niles.

55:58.353 --> 56:01.104
Jamie.

56:01.105 --> 56:03.190
We need to put this guy
on the payroll.

56:03.191 --> 56:03.691
Hmm.

56:09.155 --> 56:13.742
I'm gonna comb through
every inch of Tremo if I have to.

56:13.743 --> 56:16.745

58:34.425 --> 58:36.510
You stealing from your own father?

58:36.511 --> 58:38.387
You piece of shit.

58:38.388 --> 58:39.805
Just a couple beers.

58:39.806 --> 58:41.014
It's Friday night and all!

58:41.015 --> 58:42.391
Son of a bitch!

58:42.392 --> 58:43.517
Come on, sissy!

58:45.228 --> 58:47.229
Why don't you start weeping
while you're at it?

58:47.230 --> 58:51.149
Hey! Take it easy.

58:51.150 --> 58:52.901
Why don't you go wait
at the counter

58:52.902 --> 58:56.363
and mind your own
goddamn business?

58:56.364 --> 59:00.867
You want to try me?

59:00.868 --> 59:03.495
You're with that Niles girl, ain't ya?

59:03.496 --> 59:04.830
I recognize you.

59:04.831 --> 59:06.873
Oh, yeah.

59:15.717 --> 59:20.717
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

59:20.930 --> 59:25.930
- <i>J' I'm gonna fix my supper... J'</i>
- <i>Fucker.</i>

59:58.468 --> 01:00:03.263
Hey, it's me, Sarah.

01:00:03.264 --> 01:00:06.266
What do you want?

01:00:06.267 --> 01:00:11.267
Thought you might be hungry.

01:00:18.613 --> 01:00:23.613
I really need to use the bathroom.

01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:29.619
You're a strange girl.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.465
Be a man for once.

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:41.259
Take care of that sum-bitch.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:47.470
What are you waiting for,
you sissy?

01:01:02.448 --> 01:01:04.991
You and I need to talk.

01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:09.037
Time to wrap things up.

01:01:09.038 --> 01:01:14.038
Know what I mean?

01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:27.969
What's on your mind, angel?

01:01:34.021 --> 01:01:37.440
You want some dope?

01:01:37.441 --> 01:01:42.441
That would be nice.

01:02:02.508 --> 01:02:03.008
God!

01:02:09.056 --> 01:02:11.057
Is this what you're looking for?

01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:12.350
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.

01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:14.436
Yeah. It fucking is!

01:02:14.437 --> 01:02:16.813
You get the fuck off me!

01:02:24.947 --> 01:02:29.947
Get the fuck off me.

01:02:30.203 --> 01:02:31.453
FUCK you!

01:02:31.454 --> 01:02:33.663
You worthless piece
of fucking shit!

01:02:51.849 --> 01:02:52.349
Angel.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.552
MY angel.

01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:09.449
32 Leo Street.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.702
Where is that old woman's house?

01:04:27.445 --> 01:04:28.445
Hey!

01:04:28.446 --> 01:04:29.529
Remember me?

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:33.116
This is for fucking with my dad!

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.460
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:47.464
Good thing I found him.

01:04:47.465 --> 01:04:52.093
Have another little nip.

01:04:52.094 --> 01:04:53.595
All right.

01:04:55.139 --> 01:04:58.224
Poor boy, he's been beaten.

01:04:58.225 --> 01:05:00.810
He'll live.

01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:05.811
And call me if there's
any more trouble, Mama.

01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:15.237
Bob, leave it be.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.755
You know,
I was looking for you today.

01:05:28.756 --> 01:05:32.008
For me?

01:05:32.009 --> 01:05:34.260
Well, if it was about
the housekeeping,

01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.388
that could've waited
till tomorrow.

01:05:36.389 --> 01:05:40.850
No, it wasn't about
the housekeeping.

01:05:40.851 --> 01:05:43.269
You and your late husband,
you, uh...

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:44.896
you raised two sons,

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:47.065
Sheriff Bob and Cameron.

01:05:47.066 --> 01:05:48.775
Yes, that's right.

01:05:48.776 --> 01:05:53.154
Two big, beautiful boys.

01:05:53.155 --> 01:05:55.490
Your family didn't mind
all those long hours

01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:58.535
with you keeping house
for Zachary Niles?

01:05:58.536 --> 01:05:59.869
Well, they...

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:02.789
It was a privilege
to work for someone

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:07.790
as accomplished and...
and prosperous as Mr. Niles.

01:06:08.796 --> 01:06:13.796
And we needed
the extra money. Heh.

01:06:28.023 --> 01:06:32.235
You, the late sheriff, Bob...

01:06:32.236 --> 01:06:34.070
you're like three peas in a pod.

01:06:34.071 --> 01:06:37.991
Yes.

01:06:37.992 --> 01:06:40.702
Not Cameron, though.

01:06:40.703 --> 01:06:43.329
Well, I don't know
what you mean.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:47.333
You truly admired
and respected Niles, right?

01:06:47.334 --> 01:06:48.877
Yes, of course.

01:06:48.878 --> 01:06:50.295
I told you. That...

01:06:50.296 --> 01:06:51.796
You had a son with him,
didn't you?

01:06:51.797 --> 01:06:53.798
What?

01:06:53.799 --> 01:06:57.427
How dare you?

01:06:57.428 --> 01:06:59.679
I read the letters you wrote him,

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.725
the ones asking him
to acknowledge your son.

01:07:03.726 --> 01:07:07.479
How could you stand for it?

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.648
After the way you took care of him?

01:07:10.649 --> 01:07:15.028
After the way you felt about him?

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:20.029
It wasn't that simple.

01:07:20.493 --> 01:07:25.493
What would people think
if they knew what we were up to?

01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:30.335
How would they treat my family,

01:07:30.336 --> 01:07:32.128
my husband,

01:07:32.129 --> 01:07:37.129
my two little boys?

01:07:37.635 --> 01:07:42.388
Cameron is Niles' son.

01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:44.682
And when Niles handed
the inheritance to Ellen,

01:07:44.683 --> 01:07:48.228
Cameron realized
that he was gonna be cut out

01:07:48.229 --> 01:07:50.563
of everything that was rightfully his,

01:07:50.564 --> 01:07:53.608
<i>cut out...</i>

01:07:53.609 --> 01:07:57.737
just like his mother had been.

01:07:57.738 --> 01:07:59.614
You have no right...

01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:02.617
Deep down, you have to know...

01:08:02.618 --> 01:08:07.618
that it was Cameron
that killed Niles.

01:08:08.207 --> 01:08:10.500
That is not possible.

01:08:10.501 --> 01:08:13.002
Zach...

01:08:13.003 --> 01:08:18.002
Mr. Niles' death
was an accident.

01:08:18.759 --> 01:08:23.095
No, no. No, you're not up
on current affairs, ma'am.

01:08:23.096 --> 01:08:28.096
The coroner's office
ruled Niles' death a homicide.

01:08:28.352 --> 01:08:33.352
Your son killed his own father.

01:08:35.984 --> 01:08:38.361
You get out of here.

01:08:38.362 --> 01:08:41.447
You get out!

01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:45.285
I said leave!

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.390
What happened to you?

01:09:58.776 --> 01:10:03.776
There. Just like new.

01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:16.538
I forgot the salad.

01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:44.112
You know what I was thinking
about this morning?

01:10:44.113 --> 01:10:48.366
Stanley's.

01:10:48.367 --> 01:10:52.328
The day you asked me out.

01:10:53.872 --> 01:10:56.624
I thought I would never
see you again.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:11:00.670
Stanley's...

01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:03.423
I hope I never have to work
in a place like that again.

01:11:03.424 --> 01:11:05.550
Why should you?

01:11:05.551 --> 01:11:10.551
You're about to be rich very soon.

01:11:12.433 --> 01:11:16.144
What's with the drinking?

01:11:16.145 --> 01:11:21.145
What exactly did you have
in mind for after dinner?

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.359
You gonna stuff me in the trunk

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.360
like, uh, what's his name?

01:11:29.616 --> 01:11:34.616
Edward Carney. That's it.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:37.498
What?

01:11:37.499 --> 01:11:40.877
You didn't think I knew
who you scored your dope from?

01:11:42.004 --> 01:11:45.214
I saw you at the motel tonight.

01:11:45.215 --> 01:11:46.382
Yep.

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:47.383
Tell me something, Sarah.

01:11:47.384 --> 01:11:49.844
<i>Uh...</i>

01:11:49.845 --> 01:11:51.512
Did you fuck him first

01:11:51.513 --> 01:11:53.431
and then kill him?

01:11:53.432 --> 01:11:57.185
How exactly did that go down?

01:11:57.186 --> 01:12:00.062
That guy is Ellen's dealer.

01:12:00.063 --> 01:12:01.856
She owed him a ton of money,

01:12:01.857 --> 01:12:03.316
and fOT some TGHSOH,

01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:05.526
he thinks I'm the one
who has to pay him back.

01:12:05.527 --> 01:12:09.530
Well, he's dead now.

01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:12.408
Might as well
get rid of me next, right?

01:12:12.409 --> 01:12:16.162
I assume that is the plan, after all.

01:12:16.163 --> 01:12:19.290
Why share the money
with Edward or me? Right?

01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:21.876
I didn't even know
about Ellen's money

01:12:21.877 --> 01:12:25.046
until I found that letter!

01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:26.214
So you...

01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:27.673
Besides, this is
your fucking scheme!

01:12:27.674 --> 01:12:28.925
Do you remember that?

01:12:28.926 --> 01:12:30.593
You're telling me
that Edward Carney

01:12:30.594 --> 01:12:35.594
didn't have the exact same plan
a whole lot earlier?

01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:41.813
You're drunk.

01:12:41.814 --> 01:12:46.814
That's why you're talking so crazy.

01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:03.584
"With respect to your
pending investigation...

01:13:03.585 --> 01:13:05.878
Please be informed that
the two suspects..."

01:13:07.256 --> 01:13:08.840
"...are both wanted
for questioning

01:13:08.841 --> 01:13:10.633
"in a local
homicide investigation...

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:14.470
"...death of Ellen Niles...

01:13:14.471 --> 01:13:19.141
heroin-related overdose."

01:13:20.644 --> 01:13:23.688
Hmm.

01:13:31.864 --> 01:13:32.864
Hello.

01:13:32.865 --> 01:13:33.990
Billy.

01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:35.992
How you doing?

01:13:35.993 --> 01:13:37.910
I've been better.

01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:40.830
I know the feeling.

01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:42.248
Listen...

01:13:42.249 --> 01:13:44.041
is it possible, Billy,

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:48.713
that, uh, you gave me
the wrong DVD?

01:13:48.714 --> 01:13:52.717
You know, I wonder
what brother Bob would do

01:13:52.718 --> 01:13:54.677
if he got ahold of that video?

01:13:54.678 --> 01:13:59.678
Now, you listen to me,
you two-time loser.

01:13:59.892 --> 01:14:01.726
Are you trying to blackmail me?

01:14:01.727 --> 01:14:04.979
'Cause I'll wipe
the fucking floor with you.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:08.858
You think besmirching the late
Zachary Niles' spotless reputation

01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:11.777
is gonna put you in good
with the sheriff, my brother?

01:14:11.778 --> 01:14:16.778
You want me to call the sheriff
right fucking now?

01:14:19.703 --> 01:14:21.245
All right.

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:24.248
How much money do you want?

01:14:24.249 --> 01:14:27.752
I got $5,000.

01:14:27.753 --> 01:14:29.503
Make it 10,

01:14:29.504 --> 01:14:32.673
cash, tonight.

01:14:32.674 --> 01:14:35.593
Then we'll leave.

01:14:35.594 --> 01:14:38.054
Okay. 10, it is.

01:14:38.055 --> 01:14:43.055
And you bring that fucking DVD.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:07.208
What's up?

01:15:07.209 --> 01:15:07.709
Get in.

01:15:12.714 --> 01:15:14.465
I just got back from Mama's.

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:16.008
Guess who was there?

01:15:16.009 --> 01:15:18.928
The boyfriend, Billy.

01:15:18.929 --> 01:15:21.722
What the hell was he doing there?

01:15:21.723 --> 01:15:23.057
Mama found him in the street.

01:15:23.058 --> 01:15:24.600
He got a little roughed up.

01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:26.686
Serves him right, the smartass.

01:15:26.687 --> 01:15:30.272
Anyway, I got a piece of news for you

01:15:30.273 --> 01:15:33.025
that's gonna knock your <i>socks</i> off.

01:15:33.026 --> 01:15:35.903
Ellen Niles is dead.

01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:37.363
Is dead?

01:15:37.364 --> 01:15:38.531
Mm.

01:15:38.532 --> 01:15:40.324
Well, then, wh-who...

01:15:40.325 --> 01:15:43.494
Sarah Johnson,
Ellen's roommate,

01:15:43.495 --> 01:15:44.912
and Billy Brody.

01:15:44.913 --> 01:15:49.913
Sarah Johnson's boyfriend.

01:15:50.377 --> 01:15:51.585
Heh.

01:15:51.586 --> 01:15:53.045
Where'd you get this?

01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:54.380
L.A. Police Department.

01:15:54.381 --> 01:15:57.508
Says Ellen overdosed
on heroin weeks ago,

01:15:57.509 --> 01:16:01.470
and this Brody guy, he did time in jail
for forgery, illegal gambling.

01:16:01.471 --> 01:16:02.847
It's all there.

01:16:04.057 --> 01:16:06.183
Man! Ha ha ha.

01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:07.852
I don't believe this.

01:16:07.853 --> 01:16:12.273
Eh, I knew something was up
with them two.

01:16:12.274 --> 01:16:13.607
Bob...

01:16:13.608 --> 01:16:15.109
Hmm?

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:17.236
We got another problem.

01:16:17.237 --> 01:16:17.737
What?

01:16:22.034 --> 01:16:27.034
I can barely talk about this.

01:16:29.374 --> 01:16:31.083
Ellen or Sarah...

01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:36.084
whatever the hell her name is
gave me this.

01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:42.549
They said they...
they found it at the house.

01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:09.830
<i>No, this...</i>

01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:11.082
What the hell is this?

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.042
<i>I mean...</i>

01:17:13.043 --> 01:17:14.585
Niles never had no son.

01:17:14.586 --> 01:17:16.754
This... This... It's a forgery.

01:17:16.755 --> 01:17:21.008
Take a look at the writing.

01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:26.009
You know whose writing that is.

01:17:26.098 --> 01:17:28.182
No, I don't know nothin'.

01:17:28.183 --> 01:17:30.684
Mama used to spend
a lot of time over there.

01:17:30.685 --> 01:17:31.685
Don't say it.

01:17:31.686 --> 01:17:36.686
I'm that son.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.990
You better shut up.

01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:49.991
You don't believe me?

01:17:50.163 --> 01:17:55.163
Go ask Mama.

01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:03.175
Oh, my God.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.117
You know...

01:18:28.118 --> 01:18:33.080
that man in a black hood
in the video,

01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:36.876
he looked to be about
your size and weight.

01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:41.877
You know what? I hope you can spend
that 10,000 before they arrest you.

01:18:43.341 --> 01:18:46.635
It was you that killed Niles.

01:18:46.636 --> 01:18:49.388
This world is a better place

01:18:49.389 --> 01:18:53.350
with Niles absent from it.

01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:58.351
Trust me on that one.

01:19:04.029 --> 01:19:07.198
And I bet you knew about us
all along, didn't you?

01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:08.616
Well... Heh heh.

01:19:08.617 --> 01:19:11.076
I figured it out pretty quickly.

01:19:11.077 --> 01:19:14.246
You see, it came over the wire
that Ellen had died.

01:19:14.247 --> 01:19:18.792
Then you two dumb-asses show up here
with your hands out,

01:19:18.793 --> 01:19:22.338
had the whole town
in an uproar,

01:19:22.339 --> 01:19:24.757
took all the attention
away from me.

01:19:24.758 --> 01:19:28.677
Perfect timing.

01:19:28.678 --> 01:19:32.514
I lived in this shithole my whole life.

01:19:32.515 --> 01:19:35.351
This estate is my ticket out.

01:19:35.352 --> 01:19:37.645
It's in my blood,

01:19:37.646 --> 01:19:42.646
and I will have it.

01:19:43.526 --> 01:19:47.279
I tried to be fair to you

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.407
and that chippy of yours.

01:19:50.408 --> 01:19:55.408
I gave you every chance to run.

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:07.963
Barn door's open.

01:20:12.264 --> 01:20:15.432
Did you know that Mr. Sly Wheaton
has a legal document

01:20:15.433 --> 01:20:18.060
proving that every cent
of that estate

01:20:18.061 --> 01:20:22.064
was intended for Ellen
and nobody else, period?

01:20:22.065 --> 01:20:23.691
Did you know
that Mr. Sly Wheaton

01:20:23.692 --> 01:20:26.527
had an unfortunate
setback tonight?

01:20:26.528 --> 01:20:29.697
He's not gonna be processing
any more documents,

01:20:29.698 --> 01:20:34.698
legal or otherwise.

01:20:52.762 --> 01:20:55.306
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:55.307 --> 01:20:56.932
Now...

01:20:56.933 --> 01:20:59.852
did you really think
that I'm gonna sit here

01:20:59.853 --> 01:21:04.853
and let you walk away
with $10,000 of my money?

01:21:33.219 --> 01:21:35.679
Checkmate.

01:21:38.767 --> 01:21:40.893
Ah.

01:21:40.894 --> 01:21:45.356
I forgot all about you.

01:21:45.357 --> 01:21:46.982
I will pull the trigger.

01:21:46.983 --> 01:21:48.609
Yeah?

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:51.695
And so will I.

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.406
[ Click 1

01:21:56.326 --> 01:22:00.204
I do believe that's called...

01:22:00.205 --> 01:22:03.791
shit out of luck.

01:22:03.792 --> 01:22:08.792
Goddamn fucking whore!

01:22:10.048 --> 01:22:13.133
Now...

01:22:13.134 --> 01:22:16.553
which one of you wants to go first?

01:22:16.554 --> 01:22:21.554
That's an interesting question.

01:22:21.643 --> 01:22:26.643
What the hell
are you doing here, Bob?!

01:22:30.026 --> 01:22:34.363
You tell me.

01:22:34.364 --> 01:22:37.574
Put the gun down, Cameron.

01:22:37.575 --> 01:22:42.329
Robert, turn around,
drive away,

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:46.125
and pretend like
you never came in here.

01:22:46.126 --> 01:22:49.878
I am taking care of things.

01:22:49.879 --> 01:22:52.798
Like you always have.

01:22:52.799 --> 01:22:55.551
Now you're taking over myjob, too.

01:22:55.552 --> 01:22:57.845
What's left for me, then, little bro?

01:22:57.846 --> 01:22:59.179
What's left for...

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:04.180
You were given everything
you ever wanted!

01:23:05.145 --> 01:23:09.857
Now, Bob, go home!

01:23:09.858 --> 01:23:12.526
I'm dug in here!

01:23:12.527 --> 01:23:13.027
Please!

01:23:18.032 --> 01:23:23.032
Put the gun down, Cameron.

01:23:43.391 --> 01:23:46.226
Lord almighty.

01:23:46.227 --> 01:23:46.839
Ah, jeez.

01:24:36.444 --> 01:24:41.444
<i>J' Well, I'm leaving in the morning J'.</i>

01:24:41.449 --> 01:24:46.449
<i>J' It just ain 't the same J'.</i>

01:24:48.665 --> 01:24:53.665
<i>J' Yes, I'm leaving in the morning J'.</i>

01:24:54.212 --> 01:24:59.212
<i>J' It just ain 't the same J'.</i>

01:25:19.946 --> 01:25:22.239
Sarah.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.367
Got you some ice cream.

01:25:25.368 --> 01:25:30.368
It's chocolate, your favorite.

01:25:40.967 --> 01:25:43.719
Hi.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.512
Cash, Billy.

01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:49.099
Where's my cash?

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.434
10 grand,

01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:54.396
that's all I got from that lawyer.

01:25:54.397 --> 01:25:56.857
You lying motherfucker.

01:25:56.858 --> 01:26:01.858
Just take the fucking money,
and let us go!

01:26:05.825 --> 01:26:09.786
Athief like you...

01:26:09.787 --> 01:26:11.413
spends weeks on end

01:26:11.414 --> 01:26:13.415
baby-sitting little missy here...

01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:20.589
And 10 measly grand's
all you got to show for?

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:25.719
How's our little bird doing, Billy?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.847
I gotta call you back.

01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:30.474
Stop!

01:26:30.475 --> 01:26:33.810
That's less than 20 cents
on every dollar you owe me.

01:26:33.811 --> 01:26:36.772
What's he talking about, Billy?

01:26:36.773 --> 01:26:38.774
Ha!

01:26:38.775 --> 01:26:39.858
Aah!

01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:40.942
Your boyfriend here...

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:45.364
Stole half a kilo of my dope

01:26:45.365 --> 01:26:47.866
to pay his gambling debts.

01:26:47.867 --> 01:26:52.371
So Billy and I had
a serious conversation

01:26:52.372 --> 01:26:56.500
after I gave him a little whipping,

01:26:56.501 --> 01:27:00.128
a reminder,
so he wouldn't forget.

01:27:00.129 --> 01:27:03.924
Now you know what to do,
you fuck.

01:27:06.427 --> 01:27:08.512
The nice guy that I am,

01:27:08.513 --> 01:27:12.391
I let him have a chance
to redeem himself.

01:27:12.392 --> 01:27:16.937
What am I gonna do?

01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:20.357
Billyjust needed to give you
a helping hand...

01:27:20.358 --> 01:27:21.983
Do you know what this is?

01:27:21.984 --> 01:27:26.863
And collect your look-alike's...

01:27:26.864 --> 01:27:28.865
Ellen's fortune.

01:27:28.866 --> 01:27:30.409
Unbelievable.

01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:34.705
I mean,
you guys could be twins.

01:27:34.706 --> 01:27:36.331
You were set up, Sarah.

01:27:39.544 --> 01:27:41.420
You look confused!

01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:44.715
Heh.

01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:46.925
You thought
I'd bought the farm that first night

01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:49.344
when the bitch here
let that gun go off!

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.560
Didn't you?

01:27:56.561 --> 01:27:57.602
Fuck!

01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:08.109
God damn it!

01:28:09.449 --> 01:28:14.449
Oh, my fucking heart!

01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:20.621
God damn, Billy.

01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:36.850
Rot in hell.

01:29:25.733 --> 01:29:30.733
Was it true, what he said?

01:29:31.823 --> 01:29:36.823
It was my only chance to get out.

01:29:45.127 --> 01:29:47.796
Do you know...

01:29:47.797 --> 01:29:52.175
how sad it feels...

01:29:52.176 --> 01:29:57.055
when somebody you really care for...

01:29:57.056 --> 01:30:02.056
says just what you want to hear...

01:30:03.813 --> 01:30:08.813
and none of it's true?

01:30:13.155 --> 01:30:17.909
Every kiss...

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:22.910
every <i>look...</i>

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.920
nothing but a fairy tale.

01:30:33.175 --> 01:30:37.888
But it was true.

01:30:37.889 --> 01:30:42.889
I loved you from the moment
I walked into Stanley's.

01:30:44.562 --> 01:30:49.562
That was always true.

01:30:49.567 --> 01:30:54.567
It still is.

01:30:58.743 --> 01:31:01.202
What's this?

01:31:01.203 --> 01:31:04.497
Remember the painting?

01:31:04.498 --> 01:31:07.876
The one above the fireplace.

01:31:07.877 --> 01:31:11.296
Take it.

01:31:11.297 --> 01:31:16.297
Apparently it's worth a few dollars.

01:31:16.886 --> 01:31:21.723
You get a fresh start.

01:31:21.724 --> 01:31:26.724
Forget about me.

01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:30.732
Like Eddie said...

01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:36.321
I'm good for nothin'.

01:31:36.322 --> 01:31:39.908
You know what?

01:31:39.909 --> 01:31:44.909
Screw Eddie.

01:31:49.585 --> 01:31:54.585
<i>J' I was walking J'.</i>

01:31:55.675 --> 01:32:00.675
