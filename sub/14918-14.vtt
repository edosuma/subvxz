WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.897
Dan, listen, you raised $1. 3
million for me when I started out,

00:03.897 --> 00:06.046
and Kitty's twice the
candidate I was then.

00:06.046 --> 00:07.805
So let's have some steaks.
Let's talk about it.

00:07.805 --> 00:10.332
Uh, no. Tonight? Not tonight.
We're having dinner at mom's.

00:10.332 --> 00:13.061
Oh, I can't get to mom's.
I'm seeing a movie with Roy.

00:13.061 --> 00:13.745
A movie?

00:13.745 --> 00:15.286
No, check now,and... and I'll hold.

00:15.286 --> 00:17.631
Yeah. Why?

00:17.631 --> 00:20.582
Because that's all the two of
you seem to be doing lately.

00:20.582 --> 00:22.983
I mean, Sarah, don't you
think it's a little weird

00:22.983 --> 00:24.783
that you've been dating
this guy for over a month

00:24.783 --> 00:27.319
and you... you haven't,
you know, done any more?

00:27.319 --> 00:29.324
No. No, Kitty, I don't.

00:29.324 --> 00:31.579
I'm looking for a
relationship, not a fling.

00:31.579 --> 00:34.147
I mean, how long did you
and Robert know each other

00:34.147 --> 00:35.203
before you guys hooked up?

00:35.203 --> 00:37.595
Honey, how many dates did
we have before we had sex?

00:37.595 --> 00:40.425
- Oh, I... I don't know.
- Um, one?

00:40.425 --> 00:42.024
Did he just say "one"?

00:42.024 --> 00:44.150
No, not one. That...
that was in your dreams.

00:44.150 --> 00:45.542
Well, I... I mean,we
were working together,

00:45.542 --> 00:47.054
and, you know, then it sorta happened.

00:47.054 --> 00:48.595
Oh, it didn't just sort of happen

00:48.595 --> 00:51.149
- he totally put it in the books.
- Me? What about you,

00:51.149 --> 00:52.854
with the high heels and the push-up bra?

00:52.854 --> 00:54.927
You knew it was sexy time... Oh, hi, Dan.

00:56.768 --> 00:59.305
Oh, good. We're on.
Great. All right. Thanks.

01:00.645 --> 01:01.771
- I gotta go.
- Whoa. Whoa. Wait.

01:04.030 --> 01:07.362
- Dan Lewis... on the hook for a mil.
- Wow, $1 million.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.676
I mean, these people are
throwing money at me, Robert,

01:09.905 --> 01:10.908
and I don't even know who they are.

01:11.193 --> 01:11.998
Well, they know who you are,

01:12.484 --> 01:14.338
they know what you're
running on, and they want in.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.033
Yeah, meanwhile my own family
doesn't even know I'm running.

01:17.917 --> 01:20.438
- You haven't told 'em?
- Not that I'm running for your Senate seat.

01:21.073 --> 01:22.093
Well, don't you think it's bad form

01:22.532 --> 01:24.121
for them to hear about it
at the press conference?

01:25.184 --> 01:26.278
That is a very good point.

01:27.365 --> 01:28.391
I'm gonna tell 'em tonight.

01:28.911 --> 01:32.025
Good. And, Kitty, tell
them. Don't ask 'em.

01:33.981 --> 01:34.895
Well, of course.

01:36.881 --> 01:39.248
Bet they turn this place into
a clothing store after we leave.

01:40.554 --> 01:42.361
Scotty, this place is not gonna close.

01:42.610 --> 01:43.746
It's just a slow time.

01:44.807 --> 01:46.379
No, they're gonna put
the jeans over there,

01:47.217 --> 01:49.526
and the sweater rack over
there for the lightweight knits.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.874
Are we just gonna stand around

01:51.054 --> 01:51.983
and have a pity party all afternoon

01:52.151 --> 01:53.314
or are you gonna help me with this event?

01:54.884 --> 01:56.040
Honestly?

01:56.142 --> 01:57.361
Oh, Scotty, listen to me.

01:58.121 --> 01:59.497
You have a full house tomorrow night.

01:59.806 --> 02:01.569
You have two great guest chefs...

02:02.079 --> 02:04.371
- the mayor and me.
- Yeah.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.063
And it's gonna be fabulous.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.859
And gray skies are gonna clear up.

02:08.053 --> 02:09.393
Sunny days ahead. You'll see.

02:14.566 --> 02:14.946
Hello?

02:17.567 --> 02:18.211
Optimistic?

02:19.868 --> 02:20.983
Okay, thank you.

02:23.149 --> 02:24.122
So much for sunny days.

02:24.329 --> 02:26.504
That's the mayor, and
he's snowed in in Chicago.

02:26.725 --> 02:27.527
They booked him on a flight tomorrow,

02:27.733 --> 02:30.110
and they're "optimistic" that
he can make it here on time.

02:30.305 --> 02:32.563
Even God wants this
restaurant to close.just stop.

02:32.563 --> 02:34.613
Let's not panic, okay? We're gonna...

02:34.613 --> 02:36.483
- What's wrong with him?
- He's a little low.

02:36.483 --> 02:39.210
Would you remind him that
this restaurant is his baby?

02:39.210 --> 02:41.510
- You can't give up on it.
- Oh, the baby!

02:41.510 --> 02:43.455
Mom, can you avoid using the "b" word?

02:43.455 --> 02:44.891
We find out Monday if Michelle's pregnant.

02:44.891 --> 02:45.759
And we're all a little on edge.

02:45.759 --> 02:47.203
I'm not gonna be able to
provide for our family.

02:47.403 --> 02:49.137
I'm gonna be living in
my car again with a baby.

02:49.137 --> 02:50.755
No one is gonna be living in your car.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.549
And you know what? Let's
be honest here, Scotty.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.899
You're just the head chef
here. This puppy could go down,

02:54.899 --> 02:57.718
and you could get another
job anywhere, just like that.

02:57.718 --> 02:59.166
But you won't have to
because tomorrow night,

02:59.166 --> 03:01.039
we're all gonna wow Pasadena's finest

03:01.039 --> 03:05.282
- with some culinary magic.
- No, not "we." You're going to your reunion.

03:05.826 --> 03:08.453
- What reunion?
- It's his 20th reunion. He says he's not going.

03:08.453 --> 03:10.135
- I'm not.
- You're not going to your reunion?

03:10.135 --> 03:13.086
- He's petrified.
- I'm not petrified. I'm disdainful.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.400
- There's a difference.
- He's petrified.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.353
- He did not have a good highschool experience.
- Thanks, Scotty.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.882
Whoa. Kevin, I'll go to your reunion.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.636
Did you know one of your classmates

03:22.963 --> 03:24.663
- is a "Playboy" bunny?
- Oh, let me guess.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.364
Linda Perlmutter. Yeah.

03:26.364 --> 03:30.767
- Oh, do you remember,she developed very early?
- Like in kindergarten.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.739
- What are you, jealous?
- Kevin, why don't you want to go

03:32.739 --> 03:35.356
- to your high school reunion?
- It's like a rite of passage.

03:35.356 --> 03:36.691
Yeah, so is circumcision.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.237
Saul,it... it was the mullet.

03:39.481 --> 03:40.764
- Kevin had a mullet?
- No.

03:40.989 --> 03:43.629
- Yeah, so did Sarah.
- Yeah, at least my bangs didn't go up.

03:44.470 --> 03:47.240
Somebody's back early.

03:47.652 --> 03:48.949
Guess that means no nooky.

03:49.788 --> 03:51.340
Are you all tracking my sex life?

03:51.631 --> 03:54.197
- No, we're just looking out for you.
- Yeah, but if he hasn't tried

03:54.415 --> 03:57.007
- to jump your bones by now, he's gay.
- Or he has an STD.

03:57.346 --> 03:59.441
Or like the book says, "he's
just not that into you."

03:59.835 --> 04:01.841
Personally, I think it's very sweet

04:02.074 --> 04:03.295
that you decided to take your time.

04:03.739 --> 04:04.911
Thank you, uncle Saul.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.021
I'm trying to have a grown-up
relationship with a grown-up.

04:08.021 --> 04:10.854
And if that means we don't
jump into the sack off the bat,

04:11.613 --> 04:13.237
so be it.

04:13.237 --> 04:14.642
Now what's this I hear

04:14.642 --> 04:16.300
about you not going to
your high school reunion?

04:16.300 --> 04:19.059
- That's stupid.
- Yeah, it is crazy. I mean, if anybody shouldn't go

04:19.059 --> 04:20.890
to their high school reunion, it's me.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.544
Remember when I lost my bid
for president senior year?

04:23.544 --> 04:25.374
It was the biggest upset in the history

04:25.374 --> 04:27.653
of West San Marino
high school as I recall.

04:27.653 --> 04:30.061
She begged us to homeschool
her the rest of the year.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.675
"Send me to a convent. Anything."

04:31.675 --> 04:33.618
You know, I seriously
still can't believe that...

04:33.618 --> 04:34.449
that what was his name...

04:34.449 --> 04:36.344
Stephen Lewinsky... that he beat me.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.809
Stephen Lewinsky. Oh, what a dreamboat.

04:39.809 --> 04:41.121
All of the Lewinskys were.

04:41.453 --> 04:42.108
You had one in your year,

04:42.109 --> 04:43.236
- right, Kevin?
- Yeah, Brent. Don't remind me.

04:43.236 --> 04:44.979
Oh, wait, wait. Brent Lewinsky, right?

04:44.979 --> 04:48.139
Oh, no. He's not going.
You don't have to worry.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.035
Is there a recent picture of him?

04:50.035 --> 04:51.427
Yeah. Let me see. Let
me see. Oh, of course.

04:51.942 --> 04:55.266
- He's still annoyingly hot.
- That's why his brother won, you know?

04:55.266 --> 04:58.234
- He was a stud.
- Yeah, well, wouldn't worry about the, uh, guy

04:58.234 --> 05:00.026
you're running against in the 54th.

05:00.026 --> 05:03.665
- He's ugly.
- Well, actually, I'm not running against him anymore.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.291
You're dropping out already?

05:05.291 --> 05:07.321
No, I'm still running for office.

05:07.321 --> 05:09.203
I'm just running for a different one.

05:11.721 --> 05:13.720
I'm running for Robert's Senate seat.

05:14.555 --> 05:15.205
Robert's Senate seat?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.900
Does Robert know that?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.860
Yeah, he's the one who suggested it.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.656
I... I know that it's a shocker,

05:21.754 --> 05:26.185
but I just want to make sure
that you guys are all on board.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.982
Okay. So don't everybody speak at once.

05:33.982 --> 05:35.674
- Maybe, you know, we should take a vote.
- No.

05:35.674 --> 05:37.288
I mean, come on, like we
used to, you know, vote

05:37.288 --> 05:39.329
on family vacations and
whether or not Kevin was gay.

05:39.329 --> 05:41.665
All right, so everybody who's in favor,

05:41.665 --> 05:42.529
raise your hands now,
and then we'll get...

05:42.529 --> 05:44.964
- now wait a second.
- Wait a second.

05:44.964 --> 05:49.749
- As I remember, all those votes were anonymous.
- Uh, subtle mom.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.645
- Wait, so what, pen and paper?
- Yeah.

05:51.645 --> 05:53.180
- Let's go.
- Yeah, in the second drawer right there.

05:53.180 --> 05:56.477
Brent Lewinsky... that
is a name I have not heard

05:56.477 --> 05:59.094
- in so many years.
- Kevin, what did you ever see in him?

05:59.094 --> 06:01.148
He was a very bad influence on you

06:01.644 --> 06:04.774
uh, mom, do the words
"tall" and "drink of water"

06:04.774 --> 06:07.246
- mean anything to you?
- Uncle Saul, you gonna tally?

06:07.246 --> 06:10.112
- Yes, yes, yes. I'm tallying.
- Okay.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.341
All right. Here we go.

06:11.341 --> 06:15.853
Okay, I got one, two,
three, four, five, six.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.765
- Okay, here we go. I got a "yes."
- Thank you.

06:18.765 --> 06:20.195
- I got a "yes"...
- Thank you.

06:20.195 --> 06:21.197
- And a "yes"...
- Thank you.

06:21.197 --> 06:22.153
- And a "yes"...
- Thank you.

06:22.153 --> 06:23.752
- And a "yes"...
- Thank you.

06:23.752 --> 06:25.548
And a...

06:27.000 --> 06:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.994 --> 06:37.779
Why are you all looking at me?

06:45.583 --> 06:47.684
My attorneys promised me

06:47.719 --> 06:48.797
a rough of the contract end

06:48.798 --> 06:50.754
- of day yesterday...
- And you have a call into them.

06:50.788 --> 06:53.423
You either aren't serious
about selling your shares to me

06:53.458 --> 06:55.826
or you've got the worst
representation in California.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.729
- Dennis, this takes time.
- So...

06:58.763 --> 07:00.764
Meet me tonight. We'll
hammer out the details.

07:00.798 --> 07:03.233
Let your monkeys apply
the legalese afterwards.

07:03.268 --> 07:05.235
No, I... I can't meet you tonight.

07:05.270 --> 07:06.281
No, of course you can't.

07:07.745 --> 07:09.844
You know what? Maybe it's time
I start looking at other options.

07:09.844 --> 07:11.804
- No, wait. Dennis, wait...
- I'll tell you what...

07:13.317 --> 07:14.280
if you're serious, meet me.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.424
If not... it's been nice knowing you.

07:19.317 --> 07:22.203
So I'm guessing this means
our plans for today are off.

07:22.765 --> 07:25.270
I'm sorry. I have to go to the office.

07:31.095 --> 07:32.296
What?

07:32.944 --> 07:34.407
This has gotta stop.

07:34.407 --> 07:37.054
I'm sorry, David. But I have work to do.

07:37.054 --> 07:37.844
Work?

07:38.341 --> 07:39.212
Excuse me?

07:39.787 --> 07:41.058
You don't have any money.

07:42.106 --> 07:43.586
All you've got is your shares in Ojai,

07:43.586 --> 07:45.540
and this guy is giving
you a great price for them.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.268
Yes, which only confirms for
me how much more they're worth.

07:49.441 --> 07:53.291
York knows something
about Ojai. I'm sure of it.

07:53.291 --> 07:55.924
And I am so close to
finding out what that is.

07:55.924 --> 07:57.466
This isn't about money.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.658
This is about William
Walker and that company.

08:00.658 --> 08:02.774
This is about you holding on to something

08:02.774 --> 08:05.755
that was never yours in the first place.

08:05.928 --> 08:07.641
That was uncalled for.

08:09.307 --> 08:10.609
I'm getting ready for work.

08:15.888 --> 08:17.520
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

08:18.337 --> 08:21.153
Simon Krantz should be
Kitty's field officer.

08:21.779 --> 08:23.198
Okay. I guess we're skipping
pleasantries this morning.

08:23.615 --> 08:26.316
- Is that the list?
- Uh, yeah. Campaign directors only.

08:26.316 --> 08:27.507
Where's, uh, where's Kit?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.060
She's... out there moping.

08:30.564 --> 08:34.073
Apparently there was, a, uh,
primary in Pasadena last night.

08:34.707 --> 08:36.543
Yeah, the... the post-it election.

08:36.543 --> 08:38.177
Why? She's not hung up on that, is she?

08:38.177 --> 08:39.407
Well, she is wondering

08:39.407 --> 08:41.065
how she can be expected
to win over the masses

08:41.065 --> 08:42.907
when she can't even get
her own mother behind her.

08:45.075 --> 08:46.536
Technically, it was anonymous.

08:46.571 --> 08:47.372
She's about to announce her run.

08:47.372 --> 08:50.524
I need her in the zone, not
obsessing about her mother.

08:50.524 --> 08:52.918
Okay, well, then maybe
I should talk to her.

08:52.919 --> 08:54.224
Good. I'll talk to Nora.

08:54.224 --> 08:55.940
Um, are... are you sure about that?

08:55.940 --> 08:57.860
Because that might
actually make things worse.

08:57.861 --> 08:58.905
I can handle your mother.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.619
That's what NapolÃ©on said
on the way to Waterloo.

09:05.089 --> 09:06.396
- Oh, and, Kevin.
- Yeah.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.188
This list...

09:08.547 --> 09:10.270
I mean, obviously, your name is not on it,

09:10.270 --> 09:13.687
but you know Kitty wants you
to be her campaign director.

09:15.677 --> 09:16.536
No, I didn't know that.

09:16.711 --> 09:18.256
Well, she hasn't said it out loud,

09:18.256 --> 09:20.376
but... I mean, it's a no-brainer.

09:20.376 --> 09:23.593
- Kevin, you are the short list.
- I do have a job, you know?

09:23.593 --> 09:25.028
Which is probably why
she hasn't mentioned it.

09:25.028 --> 09:26.910
She knows how much I value you.

09:27.542 --> 09:29.553
If this is what's gonna be good for Kitty,

09:30.170 --> 09:33.283
- it's what we're gonna do.
- Okay.

09:34.118 --> 09:36.153
I didn't even know the mayor could cook.

09:36.187 --> 09:39.222
Well, I don't know if he can,
but it really doesn't matter.

09:39.257 --> 09:40.623
All he has to do is stand there and smile.

09:40.896 --> 09:41.947
I'm the guest chef.

09:41.947 --> 09:44.124
I will do all the cooking,
and Scotty will supervise it.

09:44.124 --> 09:45.955
That's how these events work.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.164
- Sounds like a plan.
- Yep.

09:54.634 --> 09:55.842
Robert, you know, my children

09:55.842 --> 09:57.904
loiter around this kitchen all the time,

09:57.904 --> 09:59.914
and that's fine, but you're a Senator.

09:59.914 --> 10:02.282
Go do something important.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.684
I am doing something important.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.455
You know what?

10:07.031 --> 10:08.385
You're barking up the wrong tree.

10:08.419 --> 10:11.208
- That "no" vote was not mine.
- Oh, come on, Nora.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.504
I mean, the thought of Kitty

10:12.504 --> 10:14.913
becoming a GOP Senator makes you shudder.

10:14.913 --> 10:17.036
- So let's... let's... let's talk about it.
- You know what?

10:17.474 --> 10:19.908
If Kitty can't handle one
"no" vote from a family member,

10:19.908 --> 10:22.223
then God help the great
state of California.

10:22.224 --> 10:23.644
But it's not just one vote.

10:23.644 --> 10:25.252
I mean, come on. It's... it's you guys.

10:25.252 --> 10:26.091
And look, there are a hundred Senators.

10:27.092 --> 10:28.844
I know how many Senators there are.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.994
I am willing to bet you there's not one that
doesn't have the entire support of their family.

10:30.678 --> 10:34.734
Well, then, you know what? I wish you lots of good luck
about finding that culprit and getting them on board.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.050
In the meantime, I'm
busy. So please excuse me.

10:38.192 --> 10:39.545
Oh, crap.

10:46.023 --> 10:48.492
Oh, Scotty. Yeah, Scotty.

10:48.526 --> 10:52.262
The mayor what? Oh, no. Denver?

10:52.296 --> 10:53.847
They had to make an emergency landing.

10:53.848 --> 10:55.031
Oh, God. Well, you know what?

10:55.066 --> 10:57.000
Just tell him to get on another flight.

10:57.034 --> 10:58.837
Bump someone. He's the mayor, after all.

10:58.837 --> 11:00.093
I know. It's awful.

11:01.291 --> 11:04.102
- Oh, hold on a second. Hello?
- Hey, Scotty. It's Robert.

11:04.102 --> 11:06.924
Oh, hi, Robert. Um, you know,
now's not really a good time...

11:06.924 --> 11:08.987
- Yeah, no. Hey. I hear you need a chef.
- What are you doing?

11:08.987 --> 11:09.805
- Yeah. How'd you hear that?
- Listen,

11:09.806 --> 11:11.130
I just want you to know that
I am completely available,

11:11.130 --> 11:14.504
- and I could be there in an hour.
- Put your hand over the phone.

11:14.504 --> 11:17.410
Really? Oh, y... yeah.
That'd be fantastic.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.385
- Put your handover the phone.
- I mean, Senator trumps mayor, right?

11:19.385 --> 11:20.443
Put your hand over the phone.

11:20.444 --> 11:21.854
Why... why don't I put
us all on speakerphone?

11:21.854 --> 11:24.012
- There you go, Scotty. You got us both.
- Hi, Scotty.

11:24.012 --> 11:26.269
Hi. Looks like we're back in business.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.051
Yeah. Isn't that lucky for us?

11:28.051 --> 11:29.941
L... listen, let's not waste
time. Nora and I will get

11:29.941 --> 11:30.927
our stuff together, and we

11:30.928 --> 11:32.597
- will be there shortly.
- We'll be there, soon.

11:32.597 --> 11:34.284
All right. I'll see you then. Bye. Thanks.

11:36.688 --> 11:38.501
Oh, come on, darling. Just a little bit.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.328
Is any of that getting in his stomach?

11:41.328 --> 11:43.081
Oh, well, it does eventually.

11:44.828 --> 11:45.877
Why don't you give him
some of this orange stuff?

11:45.877 --> 11:49.349
- It's delicious.
- Well, of course it's delicious. It's dessert.

11:49.349 --> 11:52.134
And he has to have some
of the green stuff first.

11:52.134 --> 11:53.063
- There you go.
- Why don't

11:53.064 --> 11:54.802
you bribe him a little
like mom used to do?

11:54.802 --> 11:57.432
Well, because I'm not mom. Am I, Evan?

11:58.220 --> 12:00.484
No. See? I'm on your side.

12:00.484 --> 12:02.491
That's right. I'm on your side. Yay!

12:03.068 --> 12:04.520
And if you ever decide to run for Senate,

12:04.520 --> 12:07.060
I'm gonna vote for you, even if you run

12:07.060 --> 12:09.099
as a green party candidate.

12:09.099 --> 12:12.461
- It was just a stupid vote.
- No, it wasn't a stupid vote, Kevin.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.573
It was my mother's vote... my own mother.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.117
Oh, dear.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.735
I think you have had
enough of this green stuff.

12:19.735 --> 12:21.338
Would you like to take a little break

12:21.338 --> 12:23.689
and go into your playpen? There you go.

12:24.924 --> 12:25.951
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

12:25.952 --> 12:27.524
You're not gonna let this
slow you down, are you?

12:27.558 --> 12:29.993
'Cause right now, it seems
Robert's a little more excited

12:30.027 --> 12:31.995
about this campaign than you are.

12:32.029 --> 12:35.198
I'm not gonna lie to you. It bothers me.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.755
You ready to go in your playpen?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.802
Kit, you're gonna win
this. I know you are.

12:38.836 --> 12:40.737
And you're gonna be a great Senator.

12:40.771 --> 12:43.039
Don't let one stupid little "no" vote

12:43.074 --> 12:45.041
put a damper on things.

12:45.076 --> 12:46.543
This coming from a guy

12:46.577 --> 12:48.798
who can't even face his
own high school reunion?

12:48.798 --> 12:50.553
- Oh, come on. Not that again, please.
- Well,

12:50.554 --> 12:52.685
Kevin, I don't understand
what you're so afraid of.

12:52.685 --> 12:53.386
Yeah, because you had

12:53.386 --> 12:55.332
an entirely different
experience in high school.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.021
Of course you don't understand.

12:56.022 --> 12:57.000
Oh, come on. It couldn't have been

12:57.000 --> 12:58.400
- that bad.
- I was fat.

12:58.401 --> 13:00.851
- I had no friends. Worst four years of my life.
- And look at you now.

13:00.851 --> 13:03.605
You're a completely different person.

13:03.605 --> 13:05.344
R... right. So why would
I want to go back there?

13:05.345 --> 13:06.327
Look, I'll tell you what...

13:07.212 --> 13:09.414
I promise not to dwell on mom's "no" vote

13:09.906 --> 13:11.828
if you go to your high school reunion.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.456
No, no. I wouldn't even have a date.

13:14.456 --> 13:16.410
- Scotty has this thing tonight, so...
- Well, I'll go.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.090
- You'd do that?
- Of course.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.346
I think that you need to show
the Brent Lewinskys of the world

13:23.381 --> 13:25.148
what you're really made of.

13:25.182 --> 13:26.241
Well, Brent's not gonna be there,

13:26.241 --> 13:29.057
which is why I'm only even
considering doing this.

13:29.856 --> 13:30.850
So we're going?

13:31.386 --> 13:33.841
Why do I have a feeling
I'm gonna regret this?

13:36.499 --> 13:37.264
Well, um, in front of you you'll find

13:37.264 --> 13:39.535
the menus and the recipes.
Um, we're gonna start

13:39.535 --> 13:41.056
with a watermelon and roasted beet salad,

13:41.056 --> 13:42.631
a lamb stew over polenta

13:42.631 --> 13:44.615
and for dessert, a pumpkin bread pudding.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.329
Scotty, I just want to say this.

13:46.329 --> 13:49.129
Are... are you really
set on this regular feta?

13:49.129 --> 13:51.704
A sharp feta is so much more flavorful.

13:51.704 --> 13:54.280
And this cumin... you don't
mind if I make a little tweak,

13:54.280 --> 13:55.271
- do you?
- No.

13:55.271 --> 13:56.675
Good, 'cause I was
thinking of lessening it

13:56.675 --> 13:58.254
in favor of a little more coriander

13:58.254 --> 14:00.121
to make the flavor of the meat pop.

14:00.121 --> 14:02.312
It's a trick the Israeli Prime Minister

14:02.312 --> 14:04.502
taught me at the U.N.
Food Summit last year.

14:04.993 --> 14:07.616
Okay. Well, I mean,
those both sound doable,

14:07.616 --> 14:09.398
so long as we otherwise stick
to the menu I shopped for.

14:09.398 --> 14:11.972
- Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Okay, so... okay. Great.

14:11.972 --> 14:13.567
Well, uh, you... you have
everything you need. --  Yeah.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.079
- So I'll, uh, let you get to it.
- Here we go.

14:16.079 --> 14:17.318
- All right. Thanks.
- Yeah.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.625
Okay, so why don't I
get started on the meat?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait
a minute. That's the entrÃ©e,

14:24.210 --> 14:25.051
- and my name's on it.
- Well,

14:25.052 --> 14:26.671
all the more reason why
I should probably cook it.

14:26.671 --> 14:29.264
Lamb can be very tricky.

14:29.264 --> 14:32.167
Why don't you put the
water on for the polenta?

14:32.168 --> 14:34.082
You... you want me to boil water?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.841
Didn't the Israel Prime Minister

14:35.842 --> 14:38.371
- teach you how to do that?
- You know what, guys?

14:38.371 --> 14:40.227
Um, I don't mean to interrupt here,

14:40.227 --> 14:42.573
but, um, maybe you could
share the lamb duties.

14:42.573 --> 14:45.819
- A lot goes into it.
- Excellent. Great idea.

14:46.422 --> 14:48.248
You know, he's really right about that.

14:48.248 --> 14:50.937
It's so much better this
way... you and I, together,

14:50.937 --> 14:51.902
United front.

14:52.586 --> 14:55.202
Wow. I thought you had to
check your weapons at the door.

14:55.202 --> 14:58.631
Only a republican would
see these as weapons

14:58.631 --> 15:02.548
- and not kitchen utensils.
- You know, with our Kitty in the Senate,

15:02.548 --> 15:03.885
you wouldn't have to
conceal those bad boys?

15:03.886 --> 15:04.646
Oh, Robert, for God sake.

15:04.646 --> 15:07.117
- Let's just stick to cooking tonight, all right?
- I'm just saying.

15:07.117 --> 15:08.041
Just... cook.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.171
I already feel a breakout coming on.

15:10.171 --> 15:12.708
- Did you bring any zit cream?
- Would you just relax?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.645
No. No, no, no. I'm
not wearing a name tag.

15:15.645 --> 15:18.728
- Those are for geeks.
- Nobody is gonna think you're a geek.

15:18.728 --> 15:20.856
- I think this was a mistake.
- All right, listen,

15:20.856 --> 15:24.022
you are a young, very handsome lawyer.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.287
And you're soon to be a
very young, hot father.

15:26.287 --> 15:28.505
Don't... don't say that. Okay? Really.

15:28.505 --> 15:30.027
Scotty and I, we don't want to jinx it.

15:30.027 --> 15:33.120
- We won't know if the implantation...
- Okay. Whatever, whatever.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.829
- has taken till Monday. No, I'm serious.
- Shh. Okay, okay, okay.

15:34.829 --> 15:37.237
Kitty Walker? Oh, my God.

15:37.995 --> 15:39.994
What are you doing here?
You're, like, famous.

15:41.821 --> 15:42.676
Stacy Hodges.

15:43.279 --> 15:45.168
My sister Amanda was in your class.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.211
Oh.

15:46.451 --> 15:48.963
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.842 --> 15:52.879
Seriously, how come you're
slumming it with us freshmen?

15:52.879 --> 15:53.911
Oh, I, um...

15:53.911 --> 15:56.638
I... I just wanted to be with my brother.

15:56.638 --> 15:58.608
Uh, yeah, for moral support.

15:58.608 --> 16:01.417
No, I begged him to let me come because...

16:01.417 --> 16:04.426
Well... well... well, I... I
just really like being with him

16:04.426 --> 16:06.369
because he's... he's, uh, he's so cool.

16:06.909 --> 16:08.420
Uh, Tommy, right?

16:08.420 --> 16:10.410
- Kevin.
- Kevin. Right.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.065
Sorry. Happens all the time.

16:21.629 --> 16:22.981
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

16:23.881 --> 16:24.207
What are you doing here?

16:24.207 --> 16:26.096
I thought you were going
out with mom tonight?

16:26.096 --> 16:29.197
Yeah, we were. She had
to work. What's that?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.811
Um, just some files that she asked for.

16:32.429 --> 16:35.027
Wait. She's at Ojai? Why...
why... why is she there?

16:35.773 --> 16:37.234
Uh, you'll have to ask her, Rebecca.

16:38.129 --> 16:39.097
What's all this?

16:39.964 --> 16:42.649
Uh, a friend of mine is
directing this movie in Belize.

16:42.899 --> 16:45.481
Yeah, uh, he asked me if
I'd direct the second unit.

16:45.481 --> 16:48.204
- You know, I wasn't gonna do it, but...
- You're going to Belize?

16:48.692 --> 16:49.954
For how long?

16:50.692 --> 16:51.912
Uh, probably a few months.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.297
So mom's just okay with this?

16:57.528 --> 16:58.409
I doubt she'll notice.

17:00.158 --> 17:03.099
I'm gonna, uh, stay with a friend
of mine until we fly out on Monday.

17:03.099 --> 17:04.659
- I'll call her before we leave.
- Wait, wait.

17:04.659 --> 17:06.175
So you... you guys get into a fight,

17:06.175 --> 17:09.617
- and... you just take off?
- You know what? I need a break.

17:10.627 --> 17:13.038
I, uh, I just can't
compete with ojaI anymore.

17:13.038 --> 17:14.613
You know, maybe when I get back, we'll...

17:14.614 --> 17:15.922
Business is really bad right now.

17:16.405 --> 17:17.693
I mean, so she's working a Saturday night?

17:17.693 --> 17:18.645
She's the
co-president... - No, no,

17:18.646 --> 17:19.955
no, no, no. It's more
complicated than that.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.790
You can't leave her right now.
She needs you more than ever.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.038
She's fighting for something
that she really believes in.

17:24.038 --> 17:25.452
Why can't you understand that?

17:31.567 --> 17:33.398
Good night. Good night.

17:39.866 --> 17:40.840
Are you okay with this...

17:41.715 --> 17:43.675
Whole going slow thing?

17:44.182 --> 17:47.065
- Yeah. I think slow is... good.
- Good.

17:48.042 --> 17:50.057
I slept with my husband
before I knew his last name.

17:50.812 --> 17:52.314
I got stuck with it for ten years.

17:52.314 --> 17:54.122
So that didn't work out too well for me.

17:55.148 --> 17:56.379
I probably shouldn't have told you that.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.445
For me, it's, uh, my kids mostly.

18:01.445 --> 18:02.556
Oh. I... I just...

18:03.270 --> 18:04.989
The divorce really shook
'em up, and I... I just...

18:05.701 --> 18:07.558
- I'm not sure they're ready to see me with somebody new...
- No.

18:07.558 --> 18:09.477
- And I...
- I know exactly what you mean.

18:09.478 --> 18:11.094
Had the same thing with my kids.

18:11.094 --> 18:12.891
I just... I don't think it's fair

18:12.891 --> 18:16.217
to bring someone into my life
until I know that it's real. Real.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.829
Right. I mean, it's grown-up.

18:19.829 --> 18:20.826
Yeah, yeah.

18:20.826 --> 18:22.667
Okay, then.

18:29.032 --> 18:30.797
Should we... should we be doing this?

18:34.943 --> 18:37.642
Um, yeah, but, uh, maybe
we should get a motel.

18:37.642 --> 18:41.060
- Won't that make us feel cheap?
- Yeah.

18:41.846 --> 18:43.547
Come on. Let's go before
the sitter sees me.

18:52.885 --> 18:53.628
Thank you.

18:54.427 --> 18:55.199
Club soda.

18:57.389 --> 18:57.736
Having fun yet?

18:58.047 --> 18:59.856
I'll let you know when
this third drink kicks...

19:02.995 --> 19:03.907
Brent Lewinsky?

19:03.907 --> 19:05.613
Don't sound so enthusiastic.

19:06.204 --> 19:07.396
No. I, um, I... I'm sorry.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.830
I didn't think you were
gonna be here tonight.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.798
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
make you put a cherry bomb

19:10.798 --> 19:12.274
in fishman's tailpipe or anything.

19:12.275 --> 19:13.838
Yeah, my... my ears are still ringing.

19:15.479 --> 19:17.391
- I just saw your sister.
- You... you did?

19:17.391 --> 19:19.598
Yeah. She's holding court
with the debate team.

19:19.599 --> 19:20.960
Uh, did... did you talk to her?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.335
No. Okay, here's the thing... um...

19:25.047 --> 19:27.378
You and me, we did a lot
of crazy things back then.

19:27.378 --> 19:28.914
Yeah, but what we did to your sister...

19:28.914 --> 19:32.483
Yeah. Um... I never told her.

19:32.483 --> 19:35.037
Okay? And I really need
it to stay that way.

19:36.732 --> 19:38.990
I did a lot of crazy
things back then, you know?

19:38.990 --> 19:40.237
I'm five years sober now,

19:41.403 --> 19:43.812
so my days of acting like
a complete idiot are over.

19:43.812 --> 19:45.900
Yeah. Well... well, you sure could drink.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.035
I remember that.

19:47.035 --> 19:49.545
Ugh. High school was a blur.

19:50.352 --> 19:51.485
In fact, I almost didn't come tonight.

19:51.485 --> 19:54.131
Yeah, I... I saw you RSVPD "no."

19:55.072 --> 19:56.906
There's triggers everywhere.

19:56.906 --> 19:57.418
Oh, right.

19:58.868 --> 20:00.827
- My sponsor says that I'll be all right, so...
- Yeah.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.416
How about you? You got any good memories?

20:05.416 --> 20:08.151
What, of high school? No,
it was pretty traumatizing.

20:08.151 --> 20:11.293
Not... not in a "hazing, homoerotic,

20:11.293 --> 20:12.944
"crawl around on the locker room floor

20:12.944 --> 20:15.176
and squeal like a pig"
type of way... I wish.

20:15.176 --> 20:17.778
Just more, um, sitting
alone on the bleachers

20:17.778 --> 20:20.226
with my alto sax and leg warmers, longing.

20:21.073 --> 20:23.938
- I'm gay, by the way.
-I got that.

20:23.938 --> 20:26.571
- Right.
- So what were you longing for?

20:26.571 --> 20:28.258
I don't know. Just to be
a part of things, I guess.

20:29.091 --> 20:31.258
You were a part of things.
You were part of everything.

20:31.258 --> 20:33.811
I swear, if there's a
yearbook floating around here,

20:33.811 --> 20:36.873
- you'd be in every picture.
- Yeah, I... I did edit the yearbook.

20:36.873 --> 20:39.654
You were gunning to be
most likely to succeed

20:39.654 --> 20:40.607
from day one.

20:42.885 --> 20:43.975
- Well, did you?
- What?

20:43.975 --> 20:45.304
Succeed.

20:45.304 --> 20:47.015
Uh, well, I'm... I'm a lawyer.

20:47.015 --> 20:49.078
I'm not practicing,
but that's only because

20:49.078 --> 20:51.389
- I'm working for Senator McCallister.
- No kidding?

20:51.981 --> 20:55.419
Yeah. And I'm married... to, uh, to a man.

20:56.138 --> 20:57.370
I believe we already established that.

20:58.417 --> 20:59.424
Any kids?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.247
Not yet.

21:01.795 --> 21:03.468
Oh, man, you gotta do it.

21:03.468 --> 21:04.461
I got three.

21:04.461 --> 21:06.684
My biggest accomplishment.

21:08.236 --> 21:10.698
I've made mo you know,
but next to fatherhood...

21:10.698 --> 21:13.276
That's, uh... everything
else just kind of seems silly.

21:13.276 --> 21:16.412
Very cute. Ac... actually,
we are gonna have a kid.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.204
No way. When?

21:18.204 --> 21:21.453
Uh, well, we have a surrogate,
and we just got her pregnant.

21:22.506 --> 21:24.122
Oh, man. You did succeed.

21:25.588 --> 21:26.528
Thank you. We're very excited.

21:27.579 --> 21:28.571
Hey, guys.

21:29.099 --> 21:30.653
Do you remember Kevin Walker?

21:31.239 --> 21:32.259
He's having a baby!

21:40.219 --> 21:43.121
Apps are a hit, you guys.
Can't wait to taste that stew.

21:43.156 --> 21:44.956
Just making a few improvements.

21:44.991 --> 21:46.002
Too much coriander.

21:48.852 --> 21:50.114
You're right. My bad.

21:50.495 --> 21:51.474
Oh, but it's gonna be great.

21:51.853 --> 21:52.736
Great. I'm sure it will be.

21:53.097 --> 21:55.091
Your polenta needs stirring.

21:55.627 --> 21:56.285
No, I'd rather not.

21:56.285 --> 21:58.727
- It makes it a little gluey.
- Well, if you would've used

21:58.727 --> 22:01.256
some of the low-sodium
chicken broth I suggested,

22:01.256 --> 22:02.079
it wouldn't be a problem

22:02.079 --> 22:03.696
- and it would be healthier.
- Speaking of health,

22:03.696 --> 22:05.962
did Kitty tell you that all
her doctors were unanimous,

22:05.962 --> 22:07.754
that she's up to the
rigors of the campaign?

22:07.754 --> 22:08.768
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

22:10.165 --> 22:11.778
- Cumin, please.
- So you are excited.

22:12.627 --> 22:14.905
I'm excited, Robert. I'm
excited. I'm thrilled.

22:17.348 --> 22:18.568
Robert, let me ask you a question.

22:19.054 --> 22:20.768
Why is it some important

22:21.470 --> 22:23.845
that you install my
daughter in your Senate seat?

22:23.845 --> 22:25.861
Install? You think that
I'm pulling the strings?

22:25.861 --> 22:27.430
- It was your idea, wasn't it?
- Well, yeah,

22:27.430 --> 22:29.328
when I saw that Kitty was aiming so low

22:29.328 --> 22:30.864
with the California 54th.

22:30.864 --> 22:32.279
I mean, she's so much better than that.

22:32.733 --> 22:35.654
Nora, I think Kitty is
capable of great things.

22:37.769 --> 22:38.778
You know who you sound like?

22:39.207 --> 22:39.817
Her father.

22:40.995 --> 22:42.644
You're always pushing her to be something

22:42.644 --> 22:43.733
you think she should be.

22:43.733 --> 22:44.906
That's where you and I differ, Robert.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.226
You see, I love Kitty for
just exactly who she is.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.053
Mom.

22:55.977 --> 22:56.977
Rebecca, hey.

22:57.277 --> 22:58.749
What are you doing here?
It's a Saturday night.

23:00.038 --> 23:02.387
There's not enough
hours in the week, right?

23:03.198 --> 23:05.613
- You really don't know what's going on.
- What's wrong?

23:05.613 --> 23:08.843
- Dad's leaving.
- What are you talking about?

23:08.843 --> 23:10.155
He took a movie in Belize.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.884
He's... he's gonna be
gone for three months.

23:11.884 --> 23:13.196
No, wait, wait. Hold on.

23:13.196 --> 23:15.580
He turned down that job days ago.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.989
Mom, I was just at your
house, and he was packing.

23:18.792 --> 23:19.788
He said he's gonna stay with a friend

23:19.788 --> 23:20.900
until he leaves on Monday.

23:23.420 --> 23:24.386
Right. Of course.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.403
So what? You... you guys had a fight...

23:26.403 --> 23:27.354
Yes, we did.

23:28.071 --> 23:32.226
And now your father is doing
what he does best... taking off.

23:33.652 --> 23:35.043
But... mom... "but, mom" what?

23:35.043 --> 23:37.565
What am I supposed to do?

23:37.565 --> 23:40.633
- I don't know. Maybe stop him?
- It wouldn't do any good.

23:40.633 --> 23:43.033
Mom, you're not gonna solve
Ojai's problems overnight.

23:43.033 --> 23:44.697
And you're certainly not
gonna do it by yourself.

23:44.697 --> 23:49.257
Rebecca, I asked your
father for a little time.

23:49.257 --> 23:51.732
But obviously, he
doesn't have the patience

23:51.732 --> 23:53.636
or he doesn't have any faith

23:53.636 --> 23:55.541
in what I am trying to do here.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.070
I can't change that.

23:59.561 --> 24:00.332
I'm... I'm sorry,

24:00.332 --> 24:02.541
but I have a lot of work to do.

24:10.919 --> 24:11.752
There you are.

24:11.991 --> 24:13.245
I've been looking all over for you.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.825
Yeah, look, uh, Kitty's here now.

24:15.927 --> 24:18.486
You gonna be okay? You sure?

24:19.784 --> 24:21.011
Okay, I love you, too. Bye.

24:22.257 --> 24:22.881
What happened?

24:23.591 --> 24:24.758
The implantation didn't take.

24:25.508 --> 24:26.397
Michelle had a period.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.090
Oh, crap. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.

24:29.549 --> 24:31.791
It's not the end of the
world. We have more eggs. I...

24:32.009 --> 24:33.321
Hey, Kevin! Kevin!

24:34.737 --> 24:37.444
Lewinsky told us you're doing
the whole surrogacy thing.

24:37.444 --> 24:38.274
Is that true?

24:39.662 --> 24:40.208
Yeah.

24:40.793 --> 24:43.802
Well, so did Marvin Kruger. Remember him?

24:44.579 --> 24:45.689
Hi. He's gay, too.

24:46.243 --> 24:48.205
My partner and I had our
twins about five years ago.

24:48.205 --> 24:49.774
Best thing that ever happened to us.

24:49.774 --> 24:52.902
- I'm so happy for you guys.
- Thank you.

24:52.902 --> 24:54.718
Yay! Yay.

24:57.312 --> 24:59.092
This is gonna be a hell of a
fight. It's gonna be brutal.

24:59.092 --> 25:01.709
And that's why she needs
all of you guys behind her.

25:01.709 --> 25:02.702
I'm not listening to this right now.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.739
No, but you need to. Her
opponents will come at her.

25:04.739 --> 25:07.451
- They will rip her to pieces.
- I know that.

25:08.682 --> 25:11.221
Then call her. Tell her you support her.

25:11.221 --> 25:13.773
How can you let her go into
this fight not fully armed?

25:13.773 --> 25:16.796
Because I don't want her in
this fight in the first place.

25:20.746 --> 25:21.985
There. I said it. Are you happy now?

25:23.017 --> 25:24.112
I don't want her to run.

25:25.187 --> 25:26.980
I wish I felt differently, but I don't.

25:30.588 --> 25:31.319
Hey, guys.

25:32.038 --> 25:33.020
They're calling for you.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.555
We gotta go take a bow.

25:37.196 --> 25:37.927
Yeah.

25:40.619 --> 25:41.903
And here they are.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.883
- You sure you're happy to leave?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

25:48.099 --> 25:49.885
I only came here for you.
Let's get out of here.

25:49.885 --> 25:53.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the
hell do you think you're going?

25:53.044 --> 25:55.630
Um, you know what, Brent?
I'm not feeling so good.

25:55.630 --> 25:56.478
So we're gonna duck out early.

25:56.478 --> 25:59.223
Come on, man! Don't be such a wuss.

25:59.223 --> 26:01.893
- I... I had a blast.
- Do I have to kick your ass?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.302
I'm sorry. Did you not hear what he said?

26:03.302 --> 26:05.926
He said that he didn't feel good. Kit.

26:06.510 --> 26:09.291
Didn't realize your sister
was so feisty, Walker.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.361
Y... feisty? Wh... do I know you?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.543
- No, you don't. We're gonna go.
- Brent Lewinsky.

26:14.582 --> 26:16.917
My brother Steve beat
you for class president.

26:17.544 --> 26:18.730
Did you tell her yet, Walker,

26:19.592 --> 26:22.494
- what we did?
- You know, I... I thought you were on the wagon, Brent?

26:22.494 --> 26:24.389
Oh, come on, man! It's hilarious.

26:24.389 --> 26:26.634
What... what did you do?
What did you do? What?

26:26.634 --> 26:29.304
- Tell me what? What?
- We rigged the election...

26:29.815 --> 26:31.163
me and your bro here.

26:32.101 --> 26:32.951
That's why you lost.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.342
I hoisted him up through
principal raker's window,

26:36.342 --> 26:39.270
and we switched all of your
votes for votes for my brother.

26:40.185 --> 26:41.352
You shoulda seen Kevin.

26:41.419 --> 26:43.130
I... I... I thought he
was gonna piss his pants.

26:43.130 --> 26:44.095
He was so scared.

26:46.683 --> 26:47.830
I'm so sorry, Kit.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.029
Oh, come on! Don't be such a fag.

26:50.452 --> 26:51.294
We were, like, 14.

26:52.379 --> 26:53.771
Do you think this is funny?

26:54.836 --> 26:56.042
And making yourself feel good

26:56.282 --> 26:57.996
while making everybody else feel bad...

26:58.263 --> 26:59.666
I mean, is that funny to you?

27:00.167 --> 27:02.109
Because all my brother ever
wanted was for you to like him.

27:02.610 --> 27:03.788
Kitty, please... and he thought that

27:03.967 --> 27:06.208
your little gang was cool
for some stupid reason,

27:06.420 --> 27:07.753
and he just wanted to be a part of it.

27:07.929 --> 27:09.377
But you know what you
did? You made him grovel.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.587
You made him sell his
sister down the river,

27:11.780 --> 27:13.171
but even that wasn't good
enough for you, was it?

27:14.211 --> 27:15.339
You know... you know what
I think you should do?

27:15.493 --> 27:16.620
I think you should take
a look around and see

27:16.754 --> 27:18.942
what's really going on here,
because this is not funny.

27:19.288 --> 27:20.324
And you know what else
I think you should do?

27:20.500 --> 27:21.319
I think you should go to a meeting,

27:21.427 --> 27:23.041
and I think you should make
amends, because clearly,

27:23.253 --> 27:26.045
you have a lot to be
sorry for. Come on, Kevin.

27:27.986 --> 27:30.782
Oh, oh, I, um, I have one
more thing to say to you.

27:31.881 --> 27:33.684
You ever again call my brother a fag,

27:36.441 --> 27:37.574
I will have you killed.

27:40.349 --> 27:41.597
Let's go. Let's just go.

27:44.301 --> 27:45.737
I'm such a loser.

27:46.005 --> 27:47.936
Oh, come on. It was 20 years ago.

27:48.223 --> 27:49.205
I know, and I'm still doing it.

27:49.471 --> 27:50.822
You should've seen me in there,

27:51.011 --> 27:52.685
shooting my mouth off
about being a father.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.479
It's, like, f... for what, so
I can feel like I'm... straight?

27:56.826 --> 27:58.372
So what? So what if you...

27:58.598 --> 28:00.757
if you spoke prematurely
about being a father?

28:00.931 --> 28:03.140
I mean, it doesn't make you
any less of a success story.

28:03.287 --> 28:04.651
Oh, yeah, I'm so much of a success story,

28:04.784 --> 28:06.421
I had to have my big
sister protect me just now.

28:06.577 --> 28:09.406
Well, that's what big sisters are for.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.354
You were pretty impressive.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.199
Ah, no, I wasn't.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.354
Yeah, you were.

28:15.515 --> 28:17.941
Ah, well. You know where
I get it from, don't you?

28:18.175 --> 28:19.526
Mr. Gandervort's karate class?

28:19.774 --> 28:21.259
No. I get it from mom.

28:22.356 --> 28:25.058
Ugh. It's true. It's true.

28:25.174 --> 28:28.125
And you know that "no" vote?
That was just mom being tough.

28:28.577 --> 28:31.001
And, you know, you have it,
too, even if you don't know it.

28:32.199 --> 28:34.399
And with you running
my campaign this fall,

28:34.698 --> 28:35.937
I... I swear to you,

28:36.089 --> 28:38.186
we are going to be an
impossible ticket to beat.

28:38.687 --> 28:39.302
Oh, God.

28:40.874 --> 28:41.500
What... what's wrong?

28:41.814 --> 28:43.604
Oh, God. All right.

28:45.025 --> 28:45.753
Before you go hiring me,

28:45.929 --> 28:47.151
I have to tell you something.

28:49.621 --> 28:50.803
It was me, Kit.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.976
The "no" vote wasn't mom.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.292
Wow. Wow.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.324
You... you really are full of
surprises tonight, aren't you?

29:00.533 --> 29:02.564
I'm... Kit, I am so sorry.

29:02.801 --> 29:04.307
It's just... you know, when I first heard

29:04.515 --> 29:05.555
Robert wasn't running for reelection,

29:05.670 --> 29:08.470
- I got so, so excited.
- Excited about what?

29:08.743 --> 29:09.468
Well, I...

29:11.445 --> 29:12.178
I don't know.

29:14.016 --> 29:14.972
Being free, I guess.

29:15.263 --> 29:16.080
It's j... you know what?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.811
All my life, I've been
trying to prove myself.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.379
Look, why else would a gay democrat

29:19.742 --> 29:20.959
go and work for a republican Senator

29:21.949 --> 29:23.571
if... if I wasn't trying
to prove myself, right?

29:23.995 --> 29:25.346
Kevin, you don't have to explain it to me.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.288
- I'm a big girl, and I can totally take it.
- No, you're my sister.

29:30.050 --> 29:31.137
If you wanted me to run your campaign,

29:31.379 --> 29:32.909
there's no way I could've said no to you.

29:35.075 --> 29:36.965
I'm only just realizing
it now for the first time.

29:37.370 --> 29:40.073
I, you know, I voted "no"
because I... I didn't want

29:40.273 --> 29:42.029
to have to vote "yes" to more of this,

29:43.709 --> 29:44.468
you know, politics.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.140
Kit, I am so sorry.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.646
First of all, you have to
stop saying you're sorry.

29:51.114 --> 29:52.453
- Sorry.
- I mean, this is your life,

29:53.045 --> 29:55.876
and you are allowed... to vote "no."

29:57.013 --> 29:58.437
And if you don't want to
be my campaign manager,

29:58.785 --> 30:01.525
well,... I'll find somebody else.

30:01.862 --> 30:02.592
It'll be no big deal.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.646
I mean, they won't be
as... as cute as you, but...

30:07.478 --> 30:08.751
- That's a given.
- Yeah.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.545
Do you remember in high school

30:15.741 --> 30:17.500
when we used to go home
on Saturday night or...

30:17.911 --> 30:19.200
mom's hot Fudge sundaes?

30:19.536 --> 30:21.946
Mm-hmm. Come on.

30:25.131 --> 30:25.699
Nora.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.340
No, Robert. No, no, no.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.526
The fight is over.

30:29.742 --> 30:32.185
Look, look. I'm putting my weapons away.

30:33.377 --> 30:34.151
It was Kevin.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.477
Yeah. I just got off the phone with Kitty.

30:39.862 --> 30:40.814
Kevin?

30:41.036 --> 30:43.935
Yeah, apparently, it's
part of a larger story.

30:44.454 --> 30:45.430
But, um...

30:46.604 --> 30:47.265
I'm sorry.

30:49.223 --> 30:50.155
It was Kevin.

30:52.708 --> 30:53.711
That's a surprise.

30:56.637 --> 30:57.856
Look, Robert, I voted "yes,"

30:58.147 --> 30:59.933
but in my heart, I voted "no."

31:01.423 --> 31:03.214
You're right. She is going to need us.

31:03.388 --> 31:05.112
And it's not about my politics or hers.

31:06.853 --> 31:08.175
But I am so frightened for her.

31:10.563 --> 31:12.401
It's so ugly and brutal.

31:12.606 --> 31:13.750
I watched what they did to you.

31:14.526 --> 31:15.582
Nothing was off-limits.

31:15.766 --> 31:17.574
It didn't matter whether
it was true or false.

31:19.241 --> 31:20.633
And they're gonna do
the same thing to Kitty,

31:20.809 --> 31:21.960
and I am so frightened for her.

31:22.990 --> 31:25.703
Well... she said she wants the fight.

31:27.802 --> 31:28.548
And she's tough.

31:29.733 --> 31:30.430
I know.

31:34.656 --> 31:35.925
I want to call her and talk to her.

31:36.218 --> 31:37.343
Oh, I... I don't think you have to.

31:38.776 --> 31:40.729
- She and Kevin are on their way to your house.
- Why?

31:41.093 --> 31:42.843
I don't know. Something about
making ice cream sundaes.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.658
Oh, no, they don't. I make the sundaes.

31:48.223 --> 31:49.810
I make the ice cream sundaes.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.148
I make the ice cream sundaes.

31:52.656 --> 31:53.410
Thanks for the beer.

31:56.870 --> 31:59.148
Who knew a low-rent
rendezvous could be so great?

31:59.888 --> 32:01.225
Low-rent? Are you kidding me?

32:01.425 --> 32:02.335
There's an air conditioner.

32:02.662 --> 32:05.144
There... there are movies
on demand, magic fingers...

32:05.418 --> 32:06.615
not necessarily in that order.

32:06.856 --> 32:08.565
My fingers are pretty magic, aren't they?

32:08.849 --> 32:09.875
Mm-hmm.

32:10.836 --> 32:12.176
Oh, my God. They have "spinal tap."

32:13.195 --> 32:14.439
Oh, Spinal what?

32:14.439 --> 32:15.204
Tap. You know...

32:15.204 --> 32:17.505
this dial goes up to 11.

32:18.271 --> 32:21.489
- Uh... no. I... I'm sorry.
- Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest.

32:21.489 --> 32:24.023
You know... the amp goes up to 11.

32:25.242 --> 32:28.643
11? I don't get it. Why
wouldn't 10 be the highest, uh...

32:28.888 --> 32:30.205
Because that's the joke.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.571
Okay. This movie, it's... it's
like religion in my family.

32:36.311 --> 32:37.487
I guess I just don't find
British humor that amusing.

32:37.857 --> 32:39.752
No, they're not. They're not British.

32:40.566 --> 32:41.674
They're not even British.

32:44.100 --> 32:44.919
Okay.

32:50.771 --> 32:52.219
Is everything okay?

32:52.872 --> 32:54.333
Uh, yeah.

32:56.256 --> 32:57.324
Yeah, it's just the sitter.

32:57.757 --> 32:58.941
Wants to know when I'll be home.

33:01.855 --> 33:02.775
I'm glad you're here, Holly.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.154
This is not how I like to do business...

33:06.344 --> 33:08.306
being summoned to a hotel room.

33:08.953 --> 33:10.168
So why don't you cut to the chase?

33:11.313 --> 33:12.136
All right.

33:12.944 --> 33:13.861
I think you're stalling.

33:14.746 --> 33:16.620
I think you have no intent
to sell me those shares.

33:18.024 --> 33:19.366
Why would I be stalling?

33:21.572 --> 33:22.706
Because...

33:23.935 --> 33:26.188
you think I know something
about this company

33:26.461 --> 33:27.111
that you don't.

33:30.437 --> 33:32.564
Well, the thought did cross my mind.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.008
So what if you're right?

33:37.447 --> 33:39.308
What if there's a boatload
of money out there...

33:40.579 --> 33:41.407
millions of dollars...

33:41.825 --> 33:43.031
just waiting to be spent?

33:44.593 --> 33:46.804
And what if I think I
can't get to it without you?

33:50.731 --> 33:51.761
I'm listening.

33:53.226 --> 33:54.492
How about a deal, Holly?

33:55.463 --> 33:56.633
A partnership... you and me?

33:57.779 --> 33:59.525
We go in on this together, and I swear,

33:59.860 --> 34:03.163
we will make you a very wealthy woman.

34:04.659 --> 34:05.646
Intriguing.

34:07.033 --> 34:08.495
How about I call down to room service,

34:08.745 --> 34:09.533
get us some drinks?

34:09.748 --> 34:10.478
A Martini for you?

34:10.858 --> 34:11.931
Well, before you do that,

34:12.266 --> 34:15.016
why don't you tell me about this boatload?

34:18.945 --> 34:19.924
Well, uh...

34:22.585 --> 34:23.628
I'd like to relax first.

34:25.067 --> 34:26.344
What do you mean, relax?

34:27.962 --> 34:29.906
I want the same deal that William got.

34:33.885 --> 34:34.849
You know...

34:36.199 --> 34:39.154
Clearly, you were very... loyal to him.

34:41.004 --> 34:42.797
If I'm gonna spill all my secrets to you,

34:43.717 --> 34:45.062
I'd like that same loyalty.

35:06.569 --> 35:08.048
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.070
I hear there's gonna be sundaes.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.387
- I hope you brought more ice cream.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

35:13.834 --> 35:16.875
Um... look, mom, I'm so sorry.

35:17.264 --> 35:18.857
No. No, I... I never
should've doubted you.

35:18.857 --> 35:21.037
No, Kitty, look, I didn't instantly...

35:21.414 --> 35:23.313
Smother you with support,
which is what you expected.

35:23.543 --> 35:24.663
You had every reason to doubt me.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.926
And plus, you spent the whole night

35:27.168 --> 35:28.144
in the kitchen with my husband,

35:28.380 --> 35:30.235
- which is...
- Are you kidding? That was fabulous.

35:30.541 --> 35:32.869
No. I wish you could hear
how he talks about you.

35:34.662 --> 35:35.803
Oh! Oh, my God.

35:36.886 --> 35:37.754
- What?
- Look what I found.

35:38.104 --> 35:38.737
What are they?

35:39.583 --> 35:40.351
Flags.

35:41.885 --> 35:43.540
Just like the flags I'm gonna be waving

35:43.838 --> 35:45.657
for you at every campaign stop,

35:46.018 --> 35:49.317
- from here to Eureka.
- Mom, does this mean you're changing parties?

35:50.412 --> 35:53.538
- I heard there was ice cream.
- Um, what kind of sundae do you want?

35:53.839 --> 35:55.851
- Don't tell me. Caramel with sprinkles.
- Thank you.

35:56.671 --> 35:58.454
Okay, tell me. How was the big date?

35:59.810 --> 36:00.997
Mission accomplished.

36:02.304 --> 36:03.279
In a motel.

36:03.724 --> 36:04.964
A motel?

36:04.965 --> 36:07.897
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I am so jealous.
- Sorry, mom.

36:08.411 --> 36:10.311
Oh, please. My God.

36:10.514 --> 36:12.195
It was the women of my generation...

36:12.370 --> 36:15.534
Betty Friedan, Erica Jong...
who coined the phrase "g-spot."

36:15.708 --> 36:17.093
Okay, that's disturbing.

36:17.513 --> 36:19.025
Motel sex is fabulous.

36:19.206 --> 36:20.763
Your father and I used to stop off...

36:20.764 --> 36:23.304
- Oh, mom, gross.
- Ew, ew, ew.

36:23.671 --> 36:25.001
Fine, fine, fine. No, no.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.976
I hope you had a very pleasant evening.

36:27.623 --> 36:28.857
Yeah. Did you see, like,

36:29.107 --> 36:33.152
fireworks and stars and
stripes and everything?

36:34.431 --> 36:36.631
That must be what happens
when republicans orgasm.

36:38.852 --> 36:40.594
Saul. I didn't call Saul.

36:41.499 --> 36:42.377
Oh! Okay.

36:42.647 --> 36:44.036
She's very funny tonight.

36:46.066 --> 36:47.029
Details.

36:47.285 --> 36:48.664
Oh! It was fine.

36:49.182 --> 36:50.621
Fine good? Fine bad?

36:51.583 --> 36:53.495
- Good. Fine good.
- Good.

36:53.904 --> 36:56.222
Good. The evening was a little weird.

36:57.638 --> 37:00.275
- He hasn't seen "spinal tap.
- You're kidding me?

37:00.717 --> 37:01.511
"Spinal tap"?

37:02.134 --> 37:02.998
Really?

37:03.233 --> 37:07.030
- If we need an extra push over the cliff...
- You know what we do?

37:07.517 --> 37:10.901
We put it up to 11.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.650
Okay, so it wasn't an 11 then, but...

37:12.881 --> 37:17.424
No, it was... it was a 7. 7.5.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.137
Oh, well, 7.5 is... is very good.

37:20.485 --> 37:21.050
Yeah.

37:23.856 --> 37:24.977
Then I got this text...

37:26.505 --> 37:27.276
from Luc.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.593
But I've been down that
path. It didn't work out.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.678
I can't compare Roy to a fantasy.

37:33.945 --> 37:36.141
Yeah. You know what? 7. 5
is... is pretty darn good.

37:36.365 --> 37:37.160
You can build on it.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.451
You sure can. Improvement.

38:04.621 --> 38:05.721
Holly?

38:10.909 --> 38:12.264
I... I thought you had left.

38:13.613 --> 38:14.382
Well...

38:18.084 --> 38:19.357
I forgot something.

38:20.141 --> 38:21.273
Really? What did you forget?

38:22.547 --> 38:23.456
You.

38:24.641 --> 38:25.608
What?

38:27.400 --> 38:28.999
I've asked over and over again

38:29.247 --> 38:30.088
for you to let go.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.276
And I realized...

38:33.496 --> 38:35.266
That I've never given
you any reason to believe

38:35.474 --> 38:36.769
that I would be here if you did.

38:40.915 --> 38:42.156
Marry me.

38:44.931 --> 38:45.970
Are you serious?

38:48.072 --> 38:49.986
'Cause after the night that I've had...

38:51.971 --> 38:52.879
I'm serious.

38:56.033 --> 38:56.801
Yes.

38:58.281 --> 39:00.453
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

39:01.230 --> 39:02.148
Yes, yes, yes.

39:04.268 --> 39:05.463
And... and I will let go.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.356
I am going to sell my shares.

39:07.552 --> 39:09.258
I'm gonna get out of Ojai. I mean it.

39:22.955 --> 39:24.097
It might help.

39:29.465 --> 39:31.132
You all right?

39:33.635 --> 39:35.670
You okay?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.274
I love you.

39:40.309 --> 39:41.763
I love you, too.

39:41.763 --> 39:43.911
I can't stop eating these
things. They're so good.

39:44.228 --> 39:45.687
Oh, hey, love birds. Come on.

39:45.858 --> 39:46.841
You're melting the ice cream out here.

39:48.324 --> 39:50.930
Could we just please
start this thing already?

39:51.140 --> 39:52.842
What are we starting? What
are you so grumpy about?

39:53.014 --> 39:54.149
- We're having a revote.
- A revote?

39:54.327 --> 39:56.048
Okay, the election
results are invalidated.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.759
- So we're gonna do it again and leave it at that.
- Yes.

39:57.907 --> 40:00.076
- Okay, come on. Let's get it over with.
- I'll get a paper and pen.

40:00.245 --> 40:02.925
No! No, no. No paper and pen.

40:03.352 --> 40:05.427
This is not gonna be an
anonymous vote, all right?

40:05.614 --> 40:07.139
We're gonna have it all out in the open.

40:07.273 --> 40:08.903
- I'm not gonna be falsely accused again.
- Okay.

40:09.144 --> 40:10.722
Fine. Kitty, you have the floor.

40:11.808 --> 40:14.656
- Okay, uh, all those in favor of me running...
- Aye!

40:16.536 --> 40:19.605
- Of me running for Robert's Senate seat, say...
- Aye.

40:20.032 --> 40:21.531
Aye!

40:21.531 --> 40:22.531
