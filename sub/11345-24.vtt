WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.576
- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.180
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.815
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.848 --> 00:16.650
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.684 --> 00:18.219
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.252 --> 00:20.188
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.022
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.593
- YOU SURE IT'S
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.495
- IT'S YOUR PROM,
YOU NEED THE RIGHT DRESS.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.398
- WELL, STACIE'S
TAKING CARE OF THE LIMO.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.200
- ONE WITHOUT A BAR INSIDE.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.634
- MOM, THERE WON'T
BE ANY DRINKING, I PROMISE.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.103
- [giggles]

00:35.136 --> 00:36.470
YOU'VE GROWN INTO
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, JENNA.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.805
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.573
- WELL, I'M PROUD OF YOU.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.442
YOU'RE GOING
TO DO GREAT NEXT WEEK.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776
- [grunts]
- HEY!

00:42.810 --> 00:45.213
- LEAVE US ALONE!

00:45.246 --> 00:46.747
- JUST LET HIM HAVE IT.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.449
- HERE! TAKE IT!
YOU HAPPY?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.218
- NO, NOOO!
[gunshot]

00:50.251 --> 00:51.552
[thud]

00:51.585 --> 00:54.522
[panting]
MOM! MOM! MOM!

00:54.555 --> 00:57.325
OH, MY GOD.
[panting]

01:01.262 --> 01:02.863
- FEMALE, LOOKS EARLY 40S,

01:02.896 --> 01:05.466
DECEASED FROM A SINGLE GUNSHOT,
POINT-BLANK TO THE FOREHEAD.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.767
- IN AND OUT?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.769
- DUG THE SLUG OUT OF
THAT BUILDING OVER THERE.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.538
WAS TOTALLY PANCAKED.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.306
- BUT USELESS FOR
COMPARISON.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.242
- PERP STOLE HER PURSE TOO.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.643
- WHAT'S THE SEX CRIME?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.245
- DON'T KNOW.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.579
- SO WHY ARE WE HERE?

01:18.612 --> 01:19.713
- VICTIM'S DAUGHTER.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.750
SHE TOLD THE EMT'S TO
CALL BENSON AND STABLER AT SVU.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.254
- THAT'S JENNA FOX.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.789
- OLIVIA!
OLIVIA, HE KILLED MY MOM!

01:28.822 --> 01:32.693
[crying]

01:32.726 --> 01:33.894
- YOU KNOW HER.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.664
- [sighs]
ANNETTE FOX.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.700
HER RAPE TRIAL
WAS STARTING NEXT WEEK.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.590
- IMAGINE, SEEING
YOUR MOTHER EXECUTED.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.758
- WHAT DO WE HAVE
ON THE RAPE?

02:37.791 --> 02:38.859
- PRETTY MUCH
AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE

02:38.892 --> 02:40.294
UNTIL LAST NIGHT.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.663
TWO YEARS AGO,
A WOMAN NAMED ANNETTE FOX

02:42.696 --> 02:43.864
WENT TO
THE GRAND OPENING PARTY

02:43.897 --> 02:45.933
OF SOME SALON IN SOHO,
"XCELERATER."

02:45.966 --> 02:47.535
- OWNED BY LUKE RONSON.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.337
STYLIST WHO THINKS
HE'S A ROCK STAR.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.638
- AND WE KNOW HE'S A RAPIST.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.840
THE PARTY GOES ON INTO
THE WEE HOURS,

02:52.873 --> 02:55.909
RONSON INVITES ANNETTE INTO
THE BACK FOR A PRIVATE DRINK.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.679
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, SHE'S
WAKING UP IN THE BACK OF A CAB,

02:58.712 --> 03:00.781
IN PAIN, AND HER PANTIES
ARE ON INSIDE-OUT.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.284
- ANNETTE SAYS IT WAS RAPE,
RONSON SAYS IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.385
- BUT HE OBVIOUSLY DRUGGED HER.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.554
- DOCS FOUND GHB
IN HER BLOODSTREAM,

03:06.587 --> 03:07.888
AND WE FOUND GHB
IN HIS SALON.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.790
- THAT'S POSSESSION
OF AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.492
- WELL, HE ADMITS TO THAT.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.861
HE SAYS HE USES IT AT HIS GYM,
AND HIS TRAINER BACKED HIM UP.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.863
CLAIMS SHE MUST'VE GOT
SOME RESIDUE

03:15.896 --> 03:17.831
OFF A GLASS
SHE DRANK FROM.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.334
- HE SAID-SHE SAID
WITH A CIRCUMSTANTIAL TWIST.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.769
- ANNETTE
WAS TOTALLY BELIEVABLE.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.771
AND WE KNEW
THE HUMP WOULD GO DOWN

03:23.804 --> 03:26.307
ONCE SHE TOLD HER STORY
IN FRONT OF THE JURY.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.441
- SO WHY
THE TWO YEAR WAIT?

03:27.475 --> 03:28.776
- RONSON'S ATTORNEY,
HESHY HOROWITZ,

03:28.809 --> 03:30.644
HAS JUST BEEN USING
EVERY DIVERSIONARY MOTION

03:30.678 --> 03:33.981
AND PROCEDURAL TACTIC.
HE'S STALLING HIS ASS OFF.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.716
- AND NOW
A WEEK BEFORE THE TRIAL,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.318
SHE GETS GUNNED DOWN
IN A PURSE SNATCH?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.486
- WE DON'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.754
- LUCKILY, THERE
WERE TWO SECURITY CAMERAS

03:40.788 --> 03:42.456
OUT ON
THE STREET LAST NIGHT.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.891
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
ANNETTE AND JENNA--

03:43.924 --> 03:46.627
THAT'S HER DAUGHTER--
COMING OUT OF A DRESS SHOP.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.896
AND HERE COMES
THE SO-CALLED "PURSE SNATCHER."

03:48.929 --> 03:50.331
HE'S GONNA PUSH JENNA
OUT OF THE WAY,

03:50.364 --> 03:51.699
ALMOST LIKE
HE'S GUNNING FOR MOM.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.766
- SHE FIGHTS
TO KEEP HER PURSE.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.702
BUT ONLY AFTER
SHE LETS IT GO

03:54.735 --> 03:56.704
DOES THE PERP PULL HIS PIECE
AND SHOOT HER.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.506
- THAT'S NO PURSE SNATCHING.
IT'S AN EXECUTION.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.375
- AND OUR CASE AGAINST LUKE
IS AS DEAD AS ANNETTE IS.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.644
- UNLESS WE CAN PIN
CAPITAL MURDER ON HIM.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.813
- WELL, MAYBE LIV HAS CALMED
JENNA DOWN ENOUGH

04:05.846 --> 04:07.815
WHERE SHE CAN HELP US.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.583
- IT ALL HAPPENED
SO QUICKLY.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.752
I NEVER SAW HIS FACE.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.355
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
REALLY, I'M SORRY.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.790
- JENNA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.827
- ALL I CAN REMEMBER
WAS BLOOD COMING OUT OF HER.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.995
THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.365
- JENNA, WAS YOUR MOM
AT ALL NERVOUS

04:24.398 --> 04:25.799
ABOUT THE TRIAL NEXT WEEK?

04:25.833 --> 04:28.836
- NO. SHE'S BEEN
A ROCK FOR TWO YEARS,

04:28.869 --> 04:31.739
EVER SINCE
SHE MET YOU GUYS.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.873
DID YOU CATCH HIM?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.509
- WE HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.010
- LUKE RONSON KILLED
MY MOM.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.979
TO KEEP HER FROM TESTIFYING.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.714
I SHOULD'VE PULLED
THAT HOODIE OFF HIS HEAD.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.582
I SHOULD'VE STOPPED HIM.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.684
- AND THEN HE WOULD'VE
SHOT YOU TOO.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.687
JENNA, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
MOTHER IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.756
- AND WE'LL TALK TO LUKE.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.460
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'D BE HELPFUL
IF YOU COULD THINK BACK,

04:52.493 --> 04:55.863
BEFORE TONIGHT.
OKAY?

04:55.896 --> 04:59.767
ANYTHING WEIRD
HAPPEN LATELY?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.703
- UM, SORT OF.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.573
SHE, UH, LAST WEEK...

05:05.606 --> 05:08.742
SHE SAW SOMEONE OUTSIDE
IN THE DARK,

05:08.776 --> 05:10.911
STARING AT HER
FROM THE SIDEWALK.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.012
- DID YOU SEE HIM?

05:12.045 --> 05:15.082
- NO.
SHE CALLED ME IN THE ROOM,

05:15.115 --> 05:17.585
BUT BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
HE WAS GONE.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.654
AND THEN SHE GOT
SOME WEIRD CALLS.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.889
- THREATENING?

05:21.922 --> 05:25.659
- NO, HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
HE'D JUST CALL AND HANG UP.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.895
AND I KNOW SHE KNEW
IT WAS LUKE RONSON.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.696
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

05:28.729 --> 05:31.999
- 'CAUSE THE LAST TIME
HE CALLED,

05:32.032 --> 05:35.068
SHE JUST WENT OFF
AND STARTED YELLING AT HIM.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.472
"GO TO HELL!
YOU CAN'T SCARE ME

05:38.506 --> 05:40.841
OR STOP ME FROM TELLING
THE WORLD WHAT YOU DID!"

05:40.874 --> 05:44.378
THEN SHE CALLED HIM
A GUTLESS PRICK.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.647
- YOU KNOW,
JENNA WASN'T KIDDING.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.749
I FOUND 83 CALLS
TO HER MOTHER'S CELL,

05:48.782 --> 05:50.551
AND 36
TO ANNETTE'S LANDLINE--

05:50.584 --> 05:52.386
ALL FROM THE SAME NUMBER.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.521
- YOU ABLE TO I.D. IT?

05:53.554 --> 05:54.588
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS DISPOSABLE.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.789
- OOH, THAT LEADS NOWHERE.

05:55.823 --> 05:59.092
- EXCEPT BACK TO THE STORE
WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED FROM--

05:59.126 --> 06:00.994
"BIG RUSS'S
ELECTRONICS EMPORIUM."

06:01.028 --> 06:03.897
CONVENIENTLY LOCATED
A HALF A BLOCK AWAY

06:03.931 --> 06:05.032
FROM LUKE RONSON'S SALON.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.868
- THEN THAT'S SOMETHING.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.136
WELL,
I'LL GO OUT WITH LIV...

06:09.169 --> 06:11.371
SEE WHAT THAT DIRTBAG HAS
TO SAY FOR HIMSELF.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.476
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, BABY.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.944
YOU'RE READY TO ROCK.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.680
- YOU GONNA ROCK HER
LIKE YOU DID ANNETTE FOX?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.415
- OH, NOT YOU TWO AGAIN.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.883
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M INNOCENT?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.618
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.753
- YOU KNOW,
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.955
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL THE JUDGE
ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.723
- YOU MEAN THE JUDGE
THAT'S PRESIDING OVER

06:29.757 --> 06:31.825
YOUR RAPE TRIAL
THAT'S COMING UP?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.994
- IT'S NOT TRUE.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.796
IT'S ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING!

06:35.829 --> 06:37.064
- ONLY THING THAT'S
NOT UNDERSTOOD

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
IS WHO MURDERED
THE WOMAN THAT YOU RAPED.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.435
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.837
- ANNETTE FOX.
SHE WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.840
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,
WHERE WERE YOU?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.842
- WELL, IF IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

06:48.876 --> 06:50.811
I WAS HAVING DINNER
WITH MY PUBLICIST, MARIETTE--

06:50.844 --> 06:52.913
- DON'T SAY
ANOTHER WORD, LUKE!

06:52.946 --> 06:55.182
- ENTER
THE DOUCHE BAG.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.084
- OH, LEMME GUESS,
HOROWITZ,

06:57.117 --> 06:58.919
LUKE CALLED
YOU OUT OF THE BLUE

06:58.952 --> 07:01.922
AND SAID YOU MIGHT WANT TO
DROP BY TODAY TO SAVE HIS ASS?

07:01.955 --> 07:04.592
- WRONG, I HEARD ABOUT
MS. FOX'S TRAGIC DEATH

07:04.625 --> 07:06.527
AND I KNEW YOU'D TRY
TO PIN IT ON MY CLIENT.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.962
- TRAGIC DEATH
IS BEING HIT BY A CAR,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.498
NOT NOT SHOT IN THE HEAD
BY SOME LOW-LIFE

07:10.531 --> 07:11.832
DURING A BOGUS PURSE SNATCH.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.934
- IF YOU HAD ANY
ACTUAL EVIDENCE TO BACK THAT UP,

07:13.967 --> 07:16.169
LUKE WOULD BE IN CUFFS
RIGHT NOW, BUT HE'S NOT.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.871
AND HE'S NOT ANSWERING
A SINGLE QUESTION

07:17.905 --> 07:20.608
FROM EITHER OF YOU,
SO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.942
- WELL, BE CAREFUL, LADIES.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.111
YOU ASK LUKE
FOR "A DYE JOB,"

07:24.144 --> 07:27.147
HE MIGHT
BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT!

07:28.248 --> 07:29.850
- SO, HE WAS WITH
HIS PUBLICIST?

07:29.883 --> 07:32.753
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
RETRACE HIS STEPS FROM THERE.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.623
- YES, I HAD DINNER
WITH LUKE LAST NIGHT.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.257
WE'RE PLANNING
A NEW MEDIA BLITZ.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.661
- OH, ON HOW TO
SPIN A RAPE CONVICTION?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.863
- HOW TO MARKET A NEW LINE
OF HAIR-CARE PRODUCTS.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.565
- WHAT TIME WAS DINNER OVER?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.833
- 7:30.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.200
- HE HAPPEN TO MENTION
WHAT HIS PLANS WERE

07:47.234 --> 07:48.902
FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING?
- I ALREADY KNEW.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.204
WE ATE EARLY BECAUSE
HE HAD TO GO TO ST. ANNE'S.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.941
- LUKE RONSON GOES
TO CHURCH?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.610
- HE VOLUNTEERS AT THEIR
HOMELESS SHELTER EVERY TUESDAY.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.911
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS...

07:57.945 --> 07:59.847
- EVER SINCE
HE WAS BUSTED FOR RAPE.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.082
NOW, THAT YOUR IDEA?
TRYING TO CLEAN UP HIS IMAGE?

08:02.115 --> 08:04.151
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO CLEAN UP.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.187
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT LUKE.
THE MAN'S A GIVER.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.760
- LUKE RONSON'S GIVEN
SELFLESSLY TO OUR MISSION.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.062
HIS MONEY AND HIS TIME.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.864
- WHAT'S HE DO?
SERVE FOOD?

08:16.897 --> 08:18.732
- CUTS HAIR.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.234
- HAIRDO'S FOR THE HOMELESS.
- CHECKS FOR LICE, TOO.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.771
AND TREATS THEM
WHEN THEY HAVE IT.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.939
LOOKING GOOD HELPS THEM
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES,

08:25.973 --> 08:27.975
GETS THEM READY FOR JOB
INTERVIEWS.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.977
LUKE'S BEEN A GODSEND.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.945
- HE'S ALSO A RAPIST,
SISTER PEG.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.081
- ACCUSED, NOT CONVICTED.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.584
- COME ON, SISTER.
- CONGRESS CUT MY FUNDING.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.652
I HAVE TO TAKE
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.853
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE

08:39.887 --> 08:41.955
THAT HE "HELPED" LAST NIGHT?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.957
- WELL, USUALLY I'D
BE POINTING TO EVERYBODY.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.993
BUT LUKE COULDN'T
GET THEM ALL IN.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.929
HE LEFT VERY SUDDENLY.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.666
YOU THINK
HE RAPED SOMEONE ELSE.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.634
- WELL, NOT THIS TIME.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.302
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHERE HE WENT FROM HERE.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.239
WHO WAS HIS LAST CUSTOMER?

08:59.272 --> 09:02.042
- I THINK IT WAS
EDDIE SKINNER.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.111
- NOPE,
LUKE DIDN'T CUT MY HAIR.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.714
STILL DAMN HANDSOME, HUH?
- YOU ARE A LOOKER, MR. SKINNER.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.882
- YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY
KINDA GLAD LUKE DIDN'T TOUCH ME.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.651
GUY SEEMED OFF HIS GAME.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.952
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"OFF HIS GAME?"

09:11.985 --> 09:15.989
- OH, PREOCCUPIED.
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE PISSED.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.625
HE GOT HIS CLIPPERS OUT,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.693
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE HEADED FOR THE DOOR.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.629
- TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS GOING?
- NO.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.263
BUT WHEN
HE GRABBED HIS BAG,

09:23.296 --> 09:26.099
I'M PRETTY SURE
I SAW A PIECE INSIDE.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.801
- LOOK AT ME.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.803
YOU JUST TELL ME MR. RONSON
HAD A GUN ON HIM?

09:29.837 --> 09:30.904
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

09:30.938 --> 09:34.241
WHAT THE HELL'S A HAIRDRESSER
NEED A HANDGUN FOR?

09:34.274 --> 09:38.045
- I'LL KNOW
WHEN I FIND IT.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.947
- THAT'S FOR YOU.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.984
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
I JUST CLEAN!

09:44.017 --> 09:45.653
- I'M SORRY,
BUT WE CAN AND WE ARE.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.788
- BUT MR. LUKE,
HE SHOULD BE HERE!

09:47.821 --> 09:49.089
- I HIT THE JACKPOT!

09:49.122 --> 09:51.258
I GOT SCISSORS,
HAIR CLIPPERS...

09:51.291 --> 09:54.394
A TAURUS NINE-MILLIMETER
RIGHT NEXT TO A BOX OF AMMO.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
- SAME SHELL CASINGS
FOUND AT THE SCENE.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.832
- AND LOOK HERE.
BLACK HOODED SWEATSHIRT.

09:58.866 --> 09:59.667
- WE'LL BLOW IT OUT A BIT.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.234
I THINK WE'RE
READY TO ROCK, BABY.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.303
- RONSON!
DROP THE SCISSORS!

10:03.336 --> 10:04.805
- [chuckles]

10:04.838 --> 10:07.941
DEAR, OH, LORD...
WHAT DO YOU TWO WANT NOW?

10:07.975 --> 10:09.743
- YOUR HANDS.
- LUKE RONSON,

10:09.777 --> 10:11.912
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF ANNETTE FOX.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.246
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
REMAIN SILENT.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.848
ANYTHING YOU SAY--
- CLARENCE,

10:14.882 --> 10:16.684
- WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU--
- CALL HESHY HOROWITZ!

10:16.717 --> 10:19.820
- IF YOU REFUSE THAT RIGHT--
- NOW!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.889
- BUT HE'S
NOT FINISHED YET.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.190
WHEN CAN I RESCHEDULE?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.225
- MM, ABOUT 25 YEARS.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.132
- I DIDN'T KILL ANNETTE.
- WELL, YOU ALSO SAY

10:32.165 --> 10:34.434
THAT YOU DIDN'T RAPE HER, SO
YOUR WORD'S PRETTY MEANINGLESS.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.036
- NOT TO MENTION
WE FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON

10:36.069 --> 10:38.005
IN YOUR CLOSET
IN YOUR HOME.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
- MY CLIENT'S OWNERSHIP
OF A HANDGUN PROVES NOTHING.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.809
- RIGHT UP TILL THE POINT
THAT BALLISTICS

10:41.842 --> 10:44.077
PROVES THAT IT WAS
THE ONE THAT SHOT ANNETTE.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.146
AND THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING
ANY MINUTE NOW.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.949
- HAVING AN UNPERMITTED HANDGUN
IN THE CITY IS ALSO A CRIME.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.784
- I HAVE A PERMIT FOR THAT.
- IN NEW YORK?

10:50.818 --> 10:51.752
- IN ARIZONA.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.387
- ARIZONA SOLD A GUN
TO A PSYCHO LIKE YOU?

10:54.421 --> 10:55.889
WHY DOESN'T THAT SURPRISE ME?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.357
- AND HOW DID YOU
PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK

10:57.390 --> 10:58.892
WITH YOUR
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.193
- I DON'T HAVE
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.362
- REALLY?
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS,

11:02.395 --> 11:06.133
YOUR MOUTHPIECE HERE
FILED 16 TRIAL MOTIONS

11:06.166 --> 11:08.068
FOR YOUR
"STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS."

11:08.101 --> 11:09.002
OR IS THAT
JUST A SMOKESCREEN?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.004
- IT WAS THE VERY
REAL REACTION OF A MAN

11:11.038 --> 11:12.706
WHO'S BEEN UNJUSTLY ACCUSED.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.274
- THE DEALER DIDN'T
DO A BACKGROUND CHECK.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.077
HE SAID ALL I NEEDED WAS
AN I.D. WITH AN ARIZONA ADDRESS.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.145
WHICH I HAVE.
- MR. RONSON

11:18.178 --> 11:19.913
OWNS PROPERTY IN
SCOTTSDALE.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.082
- STILL CRIMINAL POSSESSION
IF YOU HAVE A HANDGUN

11:22.115 --> 11:24.351
IN NEW YORK
WITHOUT A NEW YORK PERMIT.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.719
- WAS THE GUN LOADED
WHEN YOU FOUND IT?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.154
- UNLOADED.
- SO IT'S A MISDEMEANOR,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.222
WHICH WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
PLEAD GUILTY TO.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.858
CAN WE GO NOW?
- NO.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.392
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR GUN LAST NIGHT?

11:32.425 --> 11:33.794
- LEAVE MY CLIENT ALONE.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.162
- PEOPLE IN THE SHELTER
SAW IT IN YOUR BAG.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.499
SO WHAT WERE
YOU DOING WITH IT?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.234
- LUKE, YOU'RE
UNDER NO LEGAL OBLIGATION

11:41.268 --> 11:44.037
TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS THEY ASK.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.305
- I WAS GOING SHOOTING.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.508
- SHOOTING.
- GOTHAM GUN RANGE.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.177
- WHO SAW YOU THERE?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.412
- UH, I WAS HALFWAY THERE...

11:52.445 --> 11:54.481
AND DECIDED
NOT TO GO AFTER ALL.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.515
- THAT'S IT,
ENOUGH FISHING.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.985
- SEE, I THINK THAT
THE REASON YOU HAD THE GUN

11:58.018 --> 12:00.754
IS THE SAME REASON THAT YOU HAD
THE DISPOSABLE CELL PHONE.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.222
YOU ARE A FAILURE.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.124
AND YOU KNEW THAT YOU WOULD
FAIL IN COURT NEXT WEEK.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.125
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.360
- YOU STARTED CALLING
ANNETTE OVER AND OVER,

12:07.394 --> 12:10.530
HANG-UP AFTER HANG-UP,
HARASSING HER AND HER DAUGHTER.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.800
- THE ONLY HARASSMENT IS WHAT
YOU TWO ARE DOING TO MY CLIENT!

12:12.833 --> 12:13.867
- YOU LURKED
OUTSIDE ANNETTE'S HOUSE,

12:13.901 --> 12:15.502
AND YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF
THE BOTH OF THEM.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.204
- NO, I DIDN'T!
- BUT WHEN SHE DIDN'T BACK DOWN,

12:17.237 --> 12:20.173
YOU PUT ON THAT HOODIE,
AND YOU GRABBED THAT GUN.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.343
- YOU FINALLY
SHUT THAT BITCH UP.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.218
- JUST TELL US, RONSON.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.519
- JUST TELL US
WHAT YOU DID TO ANNETTE.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.155
IT'S OKAY, JUST SAY IT.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.858
- I--
- LUKE, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.027
I...
- WHAT IS IT?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.863
[door opens]
- DETECTIVES, I NEED A WORD.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.069
- CAN'T THIS WAIT?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.403
- LUKE'S NOT OUR KILLER.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.972
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.306
- TELL THEM
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.408
- I TESTED LUKE RONSON'S
NINE-MILLIMETER.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.079
SLUG FROM THE SCENE
WAS USELESS FOR COMPARISON,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.213
SO I TOOK A LOOK
AT THE STRIKE MARKINGS

13:00.247 --> 13:02.182
ON THE SHELL CASINGS.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.317
THE ONES FROM LUKE'S GUN
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

13:04.351 --> 13:06.186
THAN THE BRASS EJECTED
FROM THE KILLER'S GUN.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.421
- BUT IT WAS THE SAME BRAND
AND SIZE OF AMMO.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.090
- BUT NOT THE SAME GUN.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.959
- SO HE USED A DIFFERENT ONE.
WE FOUND THE HOODIE.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.861
- WHICH INITIALLY LOOKED
LIKE THE ONE IN THE VIDEO.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.228
BUT ON CLOSER INSPECTION,

13:15.262 --> 13:17.264
LUKE'S HOODIE
HAS PIPING DOWN THE SLEEVES

13:17.297 --> 13:21.034
AND A DIFFERENT LOGO
ON THE RIGHT CHEST AREA.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.904
- SO LUKE RONSON
WALKS AGAIN?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.939
- GIVE HIM A DESK TICKET
FOR THE UNPERMITTED NINE

13:25.973 --> 13:29.209
AND CUT HIM LOOSE.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.979
- SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.148
YOU SAW LUKE'S FACE WHEN
WE HAD HIM AGAINST THE WALL.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.986
THAT GUY IS
GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.454
- NOTHING TO SAY NOW?
NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.722
- I JUST WANNA MAKE
SURE YOU LEAVE

13:42.755 --> 13:46.126
WITHOUT RAPING ANY MORE WOMEN.
- GO SCREW YOURSELF, SWEETHEART.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.995
- AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND MY CLIENT,

13:48.028 --> 13:50.397
BEST OF LUCK FINDING WHOEVER
REALLY MURDERED MS. FOX.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.433
- WHY DON'T
YOU GET OUTTA HERE?

13:57.170 --> 14:00.240
- WHERE'S HE GOING?
- JENNA...HE'S GOING HOME.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.409
SWEETIE, THAT'S NOT THE MAN
THAT MURDERED YOUR MOTHER.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.945
- BUT HE RAPED HER,
YOU CAN'T JUST LET HIM GO.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.052
- [sighs]
BELIEVE ME, WE'RE NOT.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.621
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW COULD IT NOT BE HIM?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.156
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.358
- EVERYTHING'S
FALLING APART.

14:18.391 --> 14:22.095
THE TRIAL'S OFF,
MOM'S DEAD...

14:22.129 --> 14:24.932
SHE TRUSTED YOU.
I TRUSTED YOU.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.033
- NOBODY IS GIVING UP
ON YOUR MOM.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.434
- I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO TO PROM

14:27.467 --> 14:29.402
AND NOW
I HAVE TO BURY MY MOTHER.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.971
AND YOU GUYS HAVE
NO CLUE WHO KILLED HER.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.940
- JENNA,
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME--

14:32.973 --> 14:35.042
- IT'S ALREADY TAKEN
TWO YEARS!

14:35.075 --> 14:40.513
I PUT MY FAITH IN YOU,
AND--AND NOW I HAVE NO ONE!

14:40.547 --> 14:43.550
- WE'RE GONNA GET LUKE.
I PROMISE.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.567
- GUY REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM.

15:02.602 --> 15:08.575
- SO YOU WANNA GO GET
THE COFFEE OR SHOULD I?

15:08.608 --> 15:09.709
- HOW ABOUT NEITHER ONE OF US?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.946
LOOKS LIKE HE'S MAKING
HIS NEXT MOVE.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.042
THIS ISN'T
HAIR-CUTTING DAY.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.677
WHAT'S HE DOING
COMING BACK TO THE SHELTER?

15:44.711 --> 15:48.048
- THIS DUDE'S
NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.588
SISTER PEG.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.025
- ODAFIN.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.493
- I'M IN A RUSH.
LUKE RONSON COME THROUGH HERE?

16:00.527 --> 16:03.596
- YEAH,
HE WENT OVER THERE.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.001
STRANGE. I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM
BACK 'TIL NEXT WEEK.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.204
- THANK YOU.

16:11.238 --> 16:15.175
- [yelling indistinctly]
[camera clicks]

16:17.244 --> 16:19.246
[phone ringing]

16:21.248 --> 16:22.482
- YEAH,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

16:22.515 --> 16:23.650
- LUKE'S IN HERE.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.584
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S ABOUT TO TAKE THE HEAD

16:24.617 --> 16:26.686
OFF SOME HOMELESS GUY.
YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

16:26.719 --> 16:29.689
[phone beeps]

16:29.722 --> 16:31.558
- HIS NAME IS EDDIE.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.227
HE'S THE GUY WHO
SAW THE GUN IN LUKE'S BAG.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.340
[loud clattering]

16:51.278 --> 16:53.713
- UNH!

16:53.746 --> 16:55.048
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.118
OTHER HAND
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.391
HEY, I THINK OUR MAN--

17:04.424 --> 17:06.826
YEAH, LOOK AT THAT,
A DISPOSABLE PHONE.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.130
- TIME TO START TALKING,
DUMBASSES.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.564
- [chuckles]

17:11.598 --> 17:13.400
I AIN'T SAYIN' NOTHING,
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.302
- EXCEPT THROW
A TABLE AT A COP.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.138
- I WAS REACHING FOR A DONUT,
MY HAND SLIPPED.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.772
THAT AIN'T A CRIME.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.676
- WELL, IT'D BE THE FIRST ONE
YOU DIDN'T COMMIT.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.214
"EDWARD SKINNER.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.382
"15 YEARS OF PETTY LARCENY,
CHECK KITING, BOOSTING CARS,

17:29.416 --> 17:33.120
ASSAULT AND BATTERY,
BURGLARY..."

17:33.153 --> 17:35.688
OH, EDDIE...

17:35.722 --> 17:38.358
SO MUCH TO BE PROUD OF.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.393
- I KNEW EDDIE
WAS BAD NEWS

17:40.427 --> 17:44.697
THE FIRST TIME
I CUT HIS HAIR.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.633
- YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANT YOUR LAWYER?

17:46.666 --> 17:49.802
- [breathes]

17:49.836 --> 17:55.475
I NEED
TO TELL THE TRUTH NOW.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.344
I HIRED EDDIE
TO HARASS ANNETTE.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.779
- SO SHE WOULDN'T
SHOW UP AT THE TRIAL.

17:59.812 --> 18:04.151
- YEAH.
BUT I DIDN'T SAY TO KILL HER.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.153
- KILL HER? NO.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.654
I-I NEVER EVEN MET
THE BROAD.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.789
- SO WHY'D YOU HAVE THE PHONE
THAT WAS USED TO HARASS HER?

18:09.822 --> 18:11.491
- I FOUND IT IN THE PARK.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.792
THOUGHT, HEY, FREE PHONE!

18:12.825 --> 18:14.794
- I BOUGHT THE PHONE
FROM A STORE NEAR MY SALON.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.796
- SO WHATEVER EDDIE
DID TO ANNETTE

18:16.829 --> 18:18.331
WOULDN'T COME BACK ON YOU.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.332
- I TOLD HIM TO CALL HER.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.835
AND STARE AT HER
ON THE STREET.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.272
ANYTHING HE COULD DO
TO FREAK HER OUT.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.473
- HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY HIM?

18:26.506 --> 18:27.874
- $500.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.310
AND $5,000
WHEN THE TRIAL FELL APART.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.744
- I NEVER GOT SQUAT
FROM THAT LUKE GUY

18:31.778 --> 18:33.746
EXCEPT
A COUPLE CRUMMY HAIRCUTS.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.517
- NO, YOU GOT PAID
FOR HARASSING A RAPE VICTIM.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.152
YOU CALLED HER
OVER AND OVER,

18:39.186 --> 18:40.320
YOU PEEPED
THROUGH HER WINDOW,

18:40.353 --> 18:41.888
YOU STALKED HER AND HER
DAUGHTER.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.256
- YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY, PAL.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.691
- BUT YOU GOT
TOO CLEVER BY HALF.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.459
BECAUSE WHEN WE CAME
AROUND ASKING QUESTIONS,

18:46.493 --> 18:49.229
YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP
BUT BE A LITTLE HELPFUL.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.830
TRY TO PUT THAT GUN
INTO LUKE'S HAND

18:50.863 --> 18:51.864
BEFORE WE PUT IT INTO YOURS.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.533
- YES.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.902
MY GUN WAS IN THE BAG
TUESDAY NIGHT, YES.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.538
I WAS GOING
TO THE SHOOTING RANGE.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.840
BUT I STORMED OUT 'CAUSE EDDIE
WAS HAVING A GO AT ME,

19:00.873 --> 19:02.842
HE WAS TRYING TO SQUEEZE ME
OUTTA MORE MONEY.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.777
- BECAUSE THE CALLS
TO ANNETTE WEREN'T WORKING?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.846
- NO, BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO KILL HER.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.948
HE WAS LIVID BECAUSE
SHE'D YELLED AT HIM.

19:08.981 --> 19:13.220
HE WAS LIKE, "COME ON,
LET ME SMOKE THE BITCH."

19:13.253 --> 19:14.921
- YOU WERE JUST
SUPPOSED TO INTIMIDATE HER.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.890
BUT A PUNK LIKE YOU,
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SCARE HER.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.727
HMM?

19:20.760 --> 19:24.464
THAT WOMAN CALLED YOU GUTLESS.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.466
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE,
RIGHT, EDDIE?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.868
HMM?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.303
I MEAN,
I THINK YOU PROVED THAT

19:30.337 --> 19:33.473
WHEN YOU
PUT THE GUN TO HER HEAD.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.343
- I WANT MY PHONE CALL.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.481
- I HATE TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE
THAT RAPIST LUKE, BUT I DO.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.217
- EDDIE'S OUR SHOOTER.
SHERRI, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

19:44.251 --> 19:46.419
- I SAY YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT IT WOULD REALLY HELP

19:46.453 --> 19:47.987
IF WE HAD THE GUN
HE USED TO KILL ANNETTE.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.989
- SO WE TOSS
HIS LOCKER AT THE SHELTER

19:50.022 --> 19:51.758
AND EVERY OTHER ROCK
HE'S BEEN KNOWN TO HIDE UNDER.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.693
- AND IN THE MEANTIME,
WE KEEP HIM ON ICE.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.994
- ARREST LUKE
FOR WITNESS TAMPERING

19:55.027 --> 19:56.963
AND EDDIE FOR
ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.498
JUST DON'T
LOCK THEM UP TOGETHER,

19:58.531 --> 19:59.866
I DON'T WANT
THEM CONCOCTING A STORY

19:59.899 --> 20:01.268
BEFORE THEY GET
TO CENTRAL BOOKING.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.669
- I'LL THROW LUKE IN THE CAGE.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.671
YOU CAN PUT EDDIE
IN THE LOCKUP DOWNSTAIRS.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.241
- AS SOON AS
I GIVE HIM HIS PHONE CALL.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.709
- HOW LONG
IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU

20:09.742 --> 20:12.345
TO GET ME
THE HELL OUTTA HERE?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.514
HEY, YOU MIND?
THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.882
- STOP SCREAMING, THEN.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.884
- JUST, HEY...
[whistles]

20:17.917 --> 20:19.652
GET IT DONE.
[slams phone down]

20:19.686 --> 20:20.853
- I TELL YOU, I'M KINDA
SURPRISED

20:20.887 --> 20:22.955
A LOW-LIFE
LIKE YOU EVEN HAS A LAWYER.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.392
- [scoffs] THERE'S A LOT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.328
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MUCH
I KNOW ABOUT COCKROACHES.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.029
HOW YOU SPREAD DISEASE,
SKITTERING IN AND OUT

20:30.062 --> 20:32.265
OF PEOPLE'S LIVES,
MAKING THEM SICK.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.033
THIS TIME I'M
GONNA MAKE SURE YOU DON'T

20:34.066 --> 20:36.403
CRAWL BACK INTO YOUR CRACKS.
- I DIDN'T KILL THAT LADY.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.739
- YEAH? YOU KEEP
STICKING WITH THAT STORY, PAL.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.841
- HEY, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
IS IT FUN BEING A COP?

20:41.874 --> 20:44.711
- FUN?
I LOVE IT.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.845
- YEAH, SEE, I THOUGHT SO.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.780
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WANTED
TO BE A COP WHEN GREW UP.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.482
- THE PROBLEM THERE IS
YOU GOTTA CARE ABOUT PEOPLE

20:49.516 --> 20:51.684
AND THE ONLY PERSON YOU
GIVE A CRAP ABOUT IS YOURSELF.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.019
- SEE? YOU DON'T
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.854
- AND NOTHING COULD
MAKE ME HAPPIER.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.556
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.725
I THINK ONCE YOU REALIZE
I'VE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED,

20:58.758 --> 21:01.961
WE'RE GONNA BE BEST FRIENDS.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.763
- WELL, DON'T
GET TOO EXCITED, JENNA.

21:03.796 --> 21:04.897
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.833
WE STILL HAVE
TO FIND THE GUN HE USED.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.436
SO WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.671
GOOD, I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I KNOW MORE.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.905
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.641
YEAH, I'LL HAVE HIM DOWN
IN A SECOND, ALL RIGHT.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.709
YEP. VAN'S TO
CENTRAL BOOKING HERE.

21:16.743 --> 21:17.677
- WANT ME TO DO THE HONORS?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.612
- NO, I'M ALL DRESSED UP
WITH NOWHERE TO GO.

21:19.646 --> 21:23.082
I'LL DO IT.
MIKEY!

21:23.115 --> 21:27.687
RONSON, ON YOUR FEET.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.657
- ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS SUCKS?

21:30.690 --> 21:33.760
- THEN YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA LOVE THE TOMBS.

21:33.793 --> 21:39.866
TIME FOR YOU AND EDDIE
TO TAKE A LITTLE RIDE.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.834
- RONSON. THE SVU CAGE.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.370
- RONSON, LUKE. THANKS.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.772
- SEE YOU IN COURT.
FINALLY.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.742
WHERE'S EDDIE SKINNER?
- HE'S NOT ON MY LIST.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.844
- I PERSONALLY PUT HIM
DOWNSTAIRS TWO HOURS AGO.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.746
- AND I PERSONALLY EMPTIED
THE LOCK-UP TEN MINUTES AGO.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.783
EVERY PRISONER ACCOUNTED FOR.
NO EDDIE SKINNER.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.322
- WHO THE HELL LET HIM OUT?

22:08.127 --> 22:09.228
- EDDIE SKINNER?

22:09.261 --> 22:11.598
YEAH, I SIGNED HIM OUT
OF LOCKUP ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER

22:11.631 --> 22:14.000
YOU THREW HIM IN.
SOME FED TOOK HIM.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.735
- WHAT DOES FBI
WANT WITH EDDIE?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.069
- WELL,
IT WASN'T THE FIBBIES.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.038
GUY I.D.'D HIMSELF AS ATF.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.873
- AND YOU JUST
GAVE SKINNER UP LIKE THAT?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.909
- ON ORDERS FROM ONE P.P.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.076
- WHOSE ORDERS?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.078
- CHIEF OF
ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.947
HE CALLS,
I ASK HIM WHY.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.716
SON OF A BITCH TELLS ME,

22:29.749 --> 22:31.618
DO LIKE HE SAYS,
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.586
- LOOK, DID YOU AT LEAST
GET THE NAME OF

22:33.620 --> 22:35.455
THE ATF GUY
THAT TOOK SKINNER?

22:35.488 --> 22:38.558
- OR WERE YOU
TOO BUSY BENDING OVER FOR HIM?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.899
- SPECIAL AGENT GRIER?

22:46.933 --> 22:50.703
- DETECTIVES STABLER, BENSON,
AND THIS IS A.D.A. SHERRI WEST.

22:50.737 --> 22:51.404
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

22:51.438 --> 22:53.706
- PRODUCE EDDIE SKINNER.
NOW.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.008
- WHO SAYS HE'S HERE?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.745
- OUR EYES.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.047
- YEAH, WELL...
NO CAN DO.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.982
- YOU DID A GREAT JOB
OF POACHING HIM FROM US.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.884
- [clears throat]

23:04.917 --> 23:06.653
THERE A PROBLEM, AGENT GRIER?
- NOT AT ALL, SIR.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.788
JUST INFORMING
SOME FRIENDS FROM THE NYPD

23:08.821 --> 23:10.890
HOW THINGS WORK
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.560
THANK YOU, SIR.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.961
OKAY, SO YEAH...

23:14.994 --> 23:16.963
EDDIE CALLED,
AND I CAME AND SCOOPED HIM.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.699
HE SAID HE WAS BOOKED
ON A MINOR ASSAULT CHARGE.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.201
- TRY ASSAULT ON A COP.
- HE'S ALSO THE PRIME SUSPECT

23:22.234 --> 23:24.604
IN THE MURDER OF A RAPE VICTIM.
- [chuckles]

23:24.637 --> 23:26.172
- OH, SOMETHING FUNNY
ABOUT THAT?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.206
- EDDIE SKINNER'S
A LOT OF THINGS,

23:27.239 --> 23:28.040
BUT A KILLER
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.842
- AND YOU KNOW THIS
INSTINCTIVELY

23:29.876 --> 23:32.679
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE JOB,
WHAT, FIVE MINUTES?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.681
- I BUSTED EDDIE
THREE MONTHS AGO

23:34.714 --> 23:37.817
FOR TRANSPORTING UNTAXED
CIGARETTES ACROSS STATE LINES

23:37.850 --> 23:39.452
AND SELLING THEM
TO BODEGAS AROUND THE CITY.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.521
- AND LIKE ANY GOOD FED,
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD FLIP HIM.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.955
- EDDIE FLIPPED HIMSELF.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.857
SAID HE COULD DELIVER ME
THE GUY HE'S WORKING FOR.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.959
HE'S MY INSIDE MAN
ON A STING OPERATION

23:46.993 --> 23:48.695
TO BUST A RING
OF CIGARETTE SMUGGLERS.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.129
- WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
WHEN?

23:50.162 --> 23:51.698
- TOMORROW.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.132
- AND YOU THINK YOU'RE
KEEPING HIM HERE TILL THEN.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.934
- IT'S A MULTI-MILLION
DOLLAR RIP-OFF.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.003
THESE GUYS
BUY SMOKES IN MISSOURI,

23:57.036 --> 23:59.639
WHERE THE TAX IS
0.17 A PACK.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.073
- THEN THEY SELL THEM HERE,
THEY POCKET THE DIFFERENCE,

24:01.107 --> 24:03.976
INSTEAD OF PAYING
THE TAX MAN, WE GET IT.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.745
- LOOK, CIGARETTES DO
PLENTY OF HARM.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.147
BUT YOUR C.I. KILLED A WOMAN
IN COLD BLOOD.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.216
WE'RE NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT HIM.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.985
- YES YOU ARE.
EDDIE'S A FEDERAL ASSET.

24:13.019 --> 24:17.490
AND WE'RE A LITTLE HIGHER UP
THE FOOD CHAIN THAN THE NYPD.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.959
- HEY, STABLER!
- DIRTBAG, HEY!

24:19.992 --> 24:23.563
- DETECTIVE...
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

24:23.596 --> 24:25.131
- YOU'RE WELCOME
TO TRY AND STOP HIM.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.233
- YOU FIGHTING OVER ME?
I'M TOUCHED.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.868
- SKINNER IS NOT
LEAVING THIS BUILDING.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.738
- HE WILL WHEN THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY CALLS YOUR BOSS.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.240
SHERRI WEST FOR JACK MCCOY.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

24:34.273 --> 24:37.577
MAYBE WE CAN ALL
GET WHAT WE WANT HERE.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.011
AND A LITTLE GLORY, TOO.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.047
- WE'RE ALL EARS.

24:45.718 --> 24:50.189
- [laughing]

24:50.222 --> 24:52.959
- YOU INTRODUCE ME,
I'LL DO THE REST.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.594
- HEY, THESE GUYS TRUST ME.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.663
- THEN THEY'RE IDIOTS.
- HEY, COME ON, LIGHTEN UP.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.264
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER--
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

24:58.297 --> 25:01.167
YOU THINK I WANNA BE HERE?
YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR MIND.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.770
SOME STUPID ASS
CIGARETTE BUST...

25:05.337 --> 25:09.041
- I GET THE FEELING YOUR
PARTNER'S NOT A PEOPLE PERSON.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.810
- YOU DON'T
KNOW THE HALF OF IT.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.979
- IF THAT TIGHT-ASS FED
WASN'T HOLDING YOU ON A LEASH,

25:13.012 --> 25:15.982
I'D BE DROPPING YOU
DOWN A HOLE WHERE YOU BELONG.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.784
- HEY, YOU THINK MAYBE
ON THE NEXT ONE OF THESE

25:17.817 --> 25:19.652
WE DO TOGETHER, I COULD--
MAYBE I COULD WEAR THE HAT.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.954
WHAT SIZE HEAD
DO YOU HAVE?

25:21.988 --> 25:23.990
- WE'RE ON.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.925
- YEAH.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.695
[car door closes]
- HELLO, EDDIE.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.797
- COME ON, WHAT THE HELL, PHIL?
I TELL YOU I GOT A BUYER

25:30.830 --> 25:31.898
AND YOU SHOW UP
WITHOUT THE LOAD?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.566
- RELAX, IT'LL BE HERE.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.034
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.335
- HE OWNS A BUNCH OF
BODEGAS ALL OVER THE CITY.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.940
- CONVENIENCE STORES.
I'M--

25:40.973 --> 25:44.711
NAME IS ELLIOT.
- YEAH, PHIL.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.112
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.980
EDDIE'S A RUDE
SON OF A BITCH, ISN'T HE?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.916
- YEAH, WELL...
HE GROWS ON YOU.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.852
- YEAH, LIKE MOLD.
SO, ELLIOT...

25:52.885 --> 25:55.888
WHY'S AN UPSTANDING
BUSINESSMAN LIKE YOU

25:55.922 --> 25:57.790
GO FOR A SCHEME LIKE THIS?

25:57.824 --> 26:00.092
- YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT, BETWEEN CITY AND STATE,

26:00.126 --> 26:04.831
I GOTTA PAY
ALMOST $6 IN TAXES

26:04.864 --> 26:06.699
ON EVERY PACK OF SMOKES
I SELL.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.035
NO, NO WAY.
SO, YOU KNOW...

26:09.068 --> 26:10.670
EDDIE HERE SAYS
YOU GOT A SURE THING.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.104
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.240
- YOU SELL THE BUTTS
I BRING IN FOR 14 BUCKS A PACK,

26:14.273 --> 26:19.111
WE KEEP MOST OF
WHAT YOU'D PAY THE TAX MAN.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.681
- WHAT'S THE SPLIT?
- 50-50.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.115
- SEE, I TOLD YOU,
IT'S A GOOD DEAL, ELLIOT.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.251
IT'S, LIKE, THREE BUCKS
A PACK STILL.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.920
- [sighs]

26:27.954 --> 26:29.021
I'M TAKING
MOST OF THE RISK HERE.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.958
- YOU? I'M TRUCKING
THIS STUFF ACROSS STATE LINES.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.994
- AND I GOT STATE INSPECTORS
IN MY STORES, UP MY ASS 24-7.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.897
- SO YOU
DON'T WANT THE DEAL?

26:37.930 --> 26:41.801
- NO, I'M NOT
SAYING THAT, JUST...

26:41.834 --> 26:44.837
YOU GOT PRODUCT?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.341
WELL, THAT FAKE STAMP
LOOKS LEGIT.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.878
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEE EVERY ONE
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE.

26:51.911 --> 26:55.648
- ANYTHING ELSE, PRINCESS?

26:55.682 --> 26:57.884
- I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.
- EASY, TINY.

26:57.917 --> 27:01.654
YEAH, I CAN
SHOW YOU THE SHIPMENT.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.922
- WHEN CAN YOU
GET IT HERE?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.091
- FAST AS
I CAN SNAP MY FINGERS.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.127
[snaps fingers]
[light clicks]

27:13.032 --> 27:18.905
COME ON.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.073
- SHIPMENT'S
BEEN HERE ALL ALONG.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.976
- GOTTA BE A SEMI'S WORTH,
1,800 CARTONS.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.746
MILLIONS TO THESE PEOPLE.

27:26.779 --> 27:27.947
- HOW OFTEN
DO YOU GET THESE?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.249
- ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.219
NETS EACH OF US MORE
THAN $1.6 MILLION.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.822
YOU SPREAD MY SMOKES IN
WITH THE ONES YOU BUY FOR REAL,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.757
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.262
- YOU HAD ME
AT $1.6 MILLION.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.298
[static noise]
- AH...

27:46.332 --> 27:49.001
THE WAREHOUSE WALLS
ARE GIVING US INTERFERENCE.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.204
- ALL UNITS,
MOVE IN, MOVE IN!

27:52.238 --> 27:53.740
- HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:53.773 --> 27:54.874
STABLER DIDN'T GIVE
THE SIGNAL.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.976
- THIS IS MY OP,
NOT YOURS.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.211
- [sighs]

28:04.283 --> 28:07.019
- NOW ALL I NEED IS
YOUR $300,000 UP FRONT.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.788
- YEAH, LET'S
GO TO MY BRIEFCASE.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.025
[tires screeching,
sirens blare]

28:13.059 --> 28:14.293
- WE GOT COMPANY!
- WHOA!

28:14.326 --> 28:16.262
- WHOA!
[sirens]

28:16.295 --> 28:18.197
- YOU IDIOT,
YOUR BUYER'S A COP!

28:18.230 --> 28:20.232
- I'M NOT A COP.
- ATF, EVERYONE FREEZE!

28:20.266 --> 28:23.002
[yelling overlaps]
- ATF, DROP YOUR GUN!

28:23.035 --> 28:24.804
- DROP YOUR GUN!
DROP IT!

28:24.837 --> 28:28.074
- I'LL GO GET HIM!
- DROP YOUR WEAPONS NOW!

28:28.107 --> 28:31.110
- BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

28:34.213 --> 28:35.982
[thud]
- [grunts]

28:36.015 --> 28:42.054
[metal rod clangs]

28:42.088 --> 28:44.323
- [panting]
- HEY...

28:44.356 --> 28:47.059
WE MADE THE BUST.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.896
- YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.932
YOU JUST LOST MY KILLER.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.239
- SHOULD'VE SHOT THE LITTLE RAT
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.008
- EDDIE GETTING AWAY
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.912
GRIER LED THE CHARGE
INTO THAT WAREHOUSE TOO SOON.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.279
- HE GETS ALL THE GLORY,
WE GET SCREWED.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.415
I WONDER HOW GRIER FEELS
ABOUT HIS STAR INFORMANT NOW?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.550
- JUDGING BY HIS FACE
WHEN HE GOT INTO THAT AMBULANCE,

29:11.583 --> 29:13.185
I'D SAY "DIZZY."
- NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO

29:13.219 --> 29:15.888
TELLING JENNA THAT HER
MOM'S KILLER IS IN THE WIND.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.357
JUST FEELS AS THOUGH WE
KEEP FAILING HER.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.259
- LOOK, IT'S NOT OVER
TILL IT'S OVER.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.294
BESIDES, EDDIE DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE THE KIND OF GUY

29:22.328 --> 29:24.563
WHO CAN STAY UNDERGROUND.
HE NEEDS ATTENTION,

29:24.596 --> 29:26.899
[phone ringing]
SOMEBODY TO BRAG TO.

29:26.933 --> 29:27.934
- WELL,
WHEN WE FIND HIM AGAIN

29:27.967 --> 29:29.335
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
RUN HIM OVER?

29:29.368 --> 29:30.937
- I'LL HAVE YOUR BACK.
YES, FIN?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.405
- SO, AGENT GRIER...
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

29:33.439 --> 29:36.275
STABLER, I JUMPED THE GUN.
I'M SORRY.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.211
- YOU BEING SORRY IS NOT GONNA
SAVE US FROM THE ASS-WHOOPING

29:39.245 --> 29:40.980
MY A.D.A.'S GONNA
LAY ON US FOR LOSING EDDIE.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.915
- IT WAS MY SCREW UP,
I KNOW.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.283
- THANKS, FIN.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.417
FIN CHECKED
THE HOMELESS SHELTER,

29:45.451 --> 29:47.053
DIDN'T FIND EDDIE'S GUN.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.387
AND SISTER PEG HASN'T SEEN HIM
SINCE WE COLLARED HIM.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.356
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
THIS GUY BETTER THAN WE DO.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.490
WHERE ELSE WOULD HE GO?

29:51.523 --> 29:53.025
- MAYBE THE BAHAMAS?

29:53.059 --> 29:56.095
- HE MENTIONED HE ALWAYS
WANTED TO RETIRE THERE.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.529
- RETIRE FROM WHAT?
- TALKING ABOUT A GUY

29:57.563 --> 29:59.866
WHO LIVES IN A HOMELESS SHELTER.
HE NEEDS CASH.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.334
ANY OF THE BUY MONEY MISSING?

30:02.368 --> 30:04.370
- THEY TOLD ME EVERY
DOLLAR'S ACCOUNTED FOR.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.439
- THEN EDDIE'S
NOT GONNA GET VERY FAR.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.275
- UNLESS HE KNOWS
WHERE TO GET MORE.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.377
LUKE RONSON.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.213
HE NEVER PAID EDDIE
ALL THE MONEY HE OWED HIM.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.917
- YEAH, I'M GOING AS FAST
AS I CAN.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.019
- GO FASTER!
I AIN'T GOT ALL NIGHT!

30:20.052 --> 30:22.421
C'MON, C'MON!
- OKAY, OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.891
TAKE IT EASY!
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.258
- YOU OWE ME EVERYTHING
FOR WHAT I DID FOR YOU!

30:26.292 --> 30:28.427
- POLICE!
EDDIE, DROP THE GUN!

30:28.460 --> 30:30.496
- NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.599
- DON'T LET HIM SHOOT ME.
- SHUT UP!

30:33.632 --> 30:36.535
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN--

30:36.568 --> 30:39.171
STABLER,
TOSS ME YOUR CAR KEYS,

30:39.205 --> 30:40.572
ME AND HIM ARE GONNA TAKE THE
CASH, WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A RIDE.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.541
- EDDIE,
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.210
- NO, THIS IS MY WAY!

30:44.243 --> 30:47.246
IT GOES MY WAY OR
HIS BRAINS PAINT THE WALL!

30:50.416 --> 30:53.252
- EL, YOU GOT A SHOT?
- DEAD ON.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.921
- YOU SHOOT,
YOU'RE GONNA HIT ME!

30:54.954 --> 30:56.355
- I SWEAR, I'LL KILL HIM!

30:56.388 --> 30:59.325
- EDDIE...IT'S OVER.

30:59.358 --> 31:03.162
NOW YOU GOT TWO SECONDS
BEFORE IT'S FINAL.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.664
ONE...

31:05.697 --> 31:06.933
- TWO...

31:06.966 --> 31:09.135
- OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY...

31:09.168 --> 31:11.904
- DROP THE GUN!
PUT IT ON THE TABLE.

31:11.938 --> 31:15.541
DROP IT!
- EDDIE SKINNER...

31:15.574 --> 31:17.309
- [chuckles]
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

31:17.343 --> 31:20.312
FOR THE MURDER OF
ANNETTE FOX.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.281
- YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO PROVE IT.

31:22.314 --> 31:26.986
- YEAH?
I'M BETTING THIS WILL.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.255
- BULLET ON THE LEFT
CAME FROM YOUR GUN.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.358
ONE ON THE RIGHT'S
FROM ANNETTE FOX'S HEAD.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.293
- SO?
- SO...

31:34.326 --> 31:37.196
THE STRIKE MARKS
ON THE SHELL CASINGS MATCH.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.967
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GOING DOWN FOR MURDER ONE.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.069
THAT'S LIFE
WITHOUT PAROLE.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.605
- POP GOES THE WEASEL.
- [chuckles]

31:46.638 --> 31:49.041
WELL, LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
- WELL, WHAT COULD YOU

31:49.075 --> 31:50.142
POSSIBLY HAVE
THAT WE'D WANT?

31:50.176 --> 31:53.079
- I CAN GIVE YOU LUKE RONSON
FOR THE RAPE OF ANNETTE.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.314
- OH, NICE TRY.
BYE, EDDIE.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.350
- HOW CAN YOU GIVE US LUKE
FOR RAPING ANNETTE?

31:58.384 --> 32:01.187
- HE'S FULL OF IT.
ANNETTE CAN'T TESTIFY.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.389
- SHE ALREADY DID,
AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.992
AND BECAUSE LUKE'S ATTORNEY
CROSS-EXAMINED HER,

32:06.025 --> 32:08.294
I CAN HAVE ANNETTE'S
TESTIMONY READ TO THE JURY.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.262
- YOU HAVE ENOUGH
TO CONVICT LUKE OF RAPE

32:10.296 --> 32:11.363
EVEN THOUGH ANNETTE'S DEAD?

32:11.397 --> 32:14.533
- IT'S A LONG SHOT...
UNLESS I HAVE CORROBORATION.

32:17.603 --> 32:21.007
- * POP GOES THE WEASEL

32:21.040 --> 32:22.041
WHAT'LL
YOU GIVE ME FOR IT?

32:22.074 --> 32:23.309
- A CHANCE
TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY

32:23.342 --> 32:25.177
WITHOUT PRISON BARS
BLOCKING THE WAY.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.279
IF WHAT YOU TELL US
LEADS TO LUKE'S CONVICTION.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.615
- [blathers]
YEAH, SPECIFICS?

32:29.648 --> 32:33.019
- PLEAD GUILTY TO MURDER TWO
AND SERVE THE MAX--25 YEARS.

32:33.052 --> 32:38.057
YOU'LL BE OLD,
BUT YOU'LL BE OUT.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.659
- YOU COULD DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.695
- FINAL OFFER.

32:50.202 --> 32:53.205
- OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.276
LUKE AND I
WENT OUT THE NIGHT

32:57.309 --> 33:00.146
WE MADE THE DEAL
FOR ME TO HARASS ANNETTE.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.514
HE TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT THE RAPE.

33:02.548 --> 33:06.018
IN VERY INTIMATE DETAIL.

33:06.052 --> 33:09.255
HOW HE GOT HER
INTO THE BACK ROOM...

33:09.288 --> 33:11.590
HOW HE DRUGGED HER...

33:11.623 --> 33:14.460
HOW SWEET IT WAS
WHEN HE SLIPPED IT TO HER.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.727
DOES THAT HELP?

33:15.761 --> 33:19.265
- LUKE TELL YOU
TO SHOOT ANNETTE?

33:19.298 --> 33:22.334
- NO, I SMOKED
THAT BITCH ON MY OWN.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.370
SHE HAD IT COMING.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.441
- YOU GOT YOUR DEAL.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.377
- WAIT.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.544
- WHAT NOW?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.213
- YOU DROP IT DOWN
TO MURDER THREE,

33:34.246 --> 33:35.381
I'LL TELL YOU
AN EVEN JUICIER STORY.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.084
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

33:38.117 --> 33:41.120
- WHERE I GOT THE GUN
I USED TO SHOOT HER.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.324
- ELLIOT, OLIVIA...

33:45.357 --> 33:46.658
GOOD WORK
GETTING EDDIE FOR MURDER.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.394
- WE'RE NOT HERE
FOR A PAT ON THE BACK.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.363
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- THIS.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.399
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.435
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT,
AGENT GRIER?

34:00.206 --> 34:01.473
- EDDIE SKINNER
USED THAT GUN

34:01.507 --> 34:03.442
TO MURDER OUR RAPE VICTIM,
ANNETTE FOX.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.244
- AND EDDIE SAID
HE GOT IT FROM YOU.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.346
- AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?
WHAT, ARE YOU AN IDIOT?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.415
- NO, YOU GAVE A HANDGUN
TO A KNOWN FELON.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.751
- THE GUY IS A LYING WEASEL,
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF!

34:12.784 --> 34:14.620
- THEN EXPLAIN WHY THIS GUN

34:14.653 --> 34:16.855
IS ONE OF THE MISSING
GUNS FROM SHORT FUSE.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.824
- "SHORT FUSE?"

34:18.857 --> 34:21.293
- IT WAS AN UNDERCOVER PLAN
HATCHED LAST YEAR

34:21.327 --> 34:24.396
BY SOME ATF AGENTS
IN LAREDO, TEXAS.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.466
WEAPONS WERE GIVEN TO
MEXICAN ARMS SMUGGLERS,

34:27.499 --> 34:30.402
HOPING TO TRACK THEIR MOVEMENTS
TO CERTAIN DRUG CARTELS.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.437
- UNTIL ONE OF
THE GUNS WAS USED

34:31.470 --> 34:32.571
TO KILL
A BORDER PATROL AGENT.

34:32.604 --> 34:35.407
- IT WAS A BAD OP.
[slams table]

34:35.441 --> 34:36.775
- IT WAS A GOOD OP!

34:36.808 --> 34:37.743
THE ONLY WAY
WE COULD FIGURE OUT

34:37.776 --> 34:40.312
HOW DRUG RUNNERS
WERE GETTING THEIR SUPPLIES.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.281
- SHORTLY AFTER
IT ALL FELL APART,

34:42.314 --> 34:44.416
GRIER REQUESTED
A TRANSFER UP HERE.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.285
- OF COURSE HE DID,
HE WAS ON THE RUN.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.287
SO THAT'S IT,
YOU SCOOPED UP THE GUN,

34:48.320 --> 34:49.621
FILED OFF THE SERIAL NUMBER

34:49.655 --> 34:51.457
HOPING NO ONE WOULD
TRACE IT BACK TO YOU.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.625
AND A YEAR LATER
YOU POP UP HERE.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.363
HEAT'S DIED DOWN,
YOU GOT A NEW JOB...

34:57.396 --> 34:59.298
AND YOU GIVE
THAT TO YOUR C.I., EDDIE.

34:59.331 --> 35:03.435
- HE--HE SAID HE WAS
GONNA USE IT FOR PROTECTION.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.237
SAID THERE
WERE PEOPLE AFTER HIM.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.173
- AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?

35:07.206 --> 35:08.340
WHO'S THE IDIOT NOW?

35:08.374 --> 35:10.476
- THE NYPD
DOESN'T HAVE INFORMANTS?

35:10.509 --> 35:12.311
- HEY,
WE DON'T HAND OVER WEAPONS

35:12.344 --> 35:15.481
THAT HAVE A BODY COUNT ATTACHED
TO THEM AND HOPE FOR THE BEST!

35:15.514 --> 35:16.848
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

35:16.882 --> 35:18.484
BUT WE GOT A HANDGUN
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY--

35:18.517 --> 35:21.253
GOT TOO MANY OF THEM IN
THE HANDS OF TOO MANY BAD GUYS.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.356
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GETTING
THEM FROM JACKASSES LIKE YOU.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.857
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GONNA USE IT

35:25.891 --> 35:28.760
TO MURDER THAT WOMAN.
- UNTIL HE TOLD YOU HE DID.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.197
AND THAT'S WHY YOU LET HIM
CLOCK YOU WITH THAT CROWBAR.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.233
YOU WANTED TO MAKE HIM
AND THIS GUN DISAPPEAR.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.176
- PLEASE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.345
- WE UNDERSTAND,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.846
YOU PUT ANNETTE FOX
IN THAT GRAVE

35:47.879 --> 35:50.916
JUST AS SURE AS EDDIE DID.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.188
- GRIER...

35:56.222 --> 35:57.823
I NEED YOUR WEAPON
AND YOUR CREDS.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.865
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.335
- YOU'RE GONNA
LET THEM ARREST ME?

36:09.368 --> 36:10.336
- OH, YES.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.439
AND SHAKE THEIR HANDS
WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.648
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.250
YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN
WITH SKINNER?

36:24.283 --> 36:25.551
- OH, YEAH, LIKE I WANNA
BE STUCK IN HERE WITH YOU.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.219
- OH, SHUT UP!
- TOO LATE, STUPID.

36:27.253 --> 36:28.420
I ALREADY TOLD
THEM ALL ABOUT YOU.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.356
- HEY! ALL OF YOU,
SEPARATE CORNERS,

36:30.389 --> 36:32.658
AND BEHAVE YOURSELVES.
SHOULD LET YOU FIGHT IT OUT,

36:32.691 --> 36:33.925
SAVE THE COURTS
SOME TROUBLE.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.394
IF YOU'RE HERE
TO SAVE SOME SOULS,

36:35.427 --> 36:36.595
I THINK THOSE THREE
ARE BEYOND HELP.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.896
- ACTUALLY,
SISTER PEG'S DOING

36:37.929 --> 36:39.231
A DIFFERENT KIND
OF WORK FOR THE LORD.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.299
CHECK THAT OUT.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.301
- I FOUND THOSE HIDDEN IN
SOMEONE ELSE'S LOCKER

36:42.334 --> 36:44.570
AT THE SHELTER,
BUT THAT'S EDDIE'S HANDWRITING.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.573
- ANNETTE'S HOME AND WORK
ADDRESSES, PLACES THAT SHE WENT.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.341

OF HER AND JENNA.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.709
TELEPHOTO, HUH?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.478
EDDIE'S GOING DOWN
WON'T BRING MOM BACK,

36:52.511 --> 36:54.413
BUT AT LEAST JENNA
WILL GET SOME CLOSURE.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.947
- YOU CAN TELL HER
IN PERSON.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.949
FRONT DESK SAYS JENNA'S
ON HER WAY UP.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.960
- OLIVIA.
- I WAS JUST GONNA CALL YOU.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.464
- I, UM, I HEARD YOU FOUND
MY MOTHER'S KILLER.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.766
- WE DID.
- WHO IS IT?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.703
- HIS NAME IS EDDIE SKINNER.
HE'S A LIFELONG CRIMINAL.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.405
LUKE HIRED HIM
TO STALK YOUR MOTHER.

37:19.438 --> 37:22.574
- AND WHAT ABOUT LUKE?
- WE GOT HIM TOO.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.610
HIS TRIAL FOR RAPING
YOUR MOTHER IS BACK ON.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.779
- THAT'S GREAT.
WHERE ARE THEY?

37:27.813 --> 37:30.549
- THEY'RE IN OUR CAGE
WHERE THEY BELONG.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.828
- SO THAT'S HIM, RIGHT?

37:42.861 --> 37:46.365
- YES.
IT IS.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.733
- WELL, WHO'S HE?

37:47.766 --> 37:49.801
- HE'S A FEDERAL AGENT.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.838
HE'S THE ONE
WHO GAVE EDDIE THE GUN.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.811
YOU OKAY?

37:59.845 --> 38:01.880
- AS OKAY AS I'LL EVER BE.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.515
THANK YOU, OLIVIA.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.651
- YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALRIGHT GETTING HOME?

38:05.684 --> 38:06.852
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.387
- LISTEN,
YOU HAVE MY CARD.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.856
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
PROMISE ME YOU'LL CALL ME.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.892
- MM-HMM.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.098
- HOW LONG TILL THOSE IDIOTS
GO TO CENTRAL BOOKING?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.401
- NOT SOON ENOUGH.

38:22.434 --> 38:25.003
[gunfire]

38:25.036 --> 38:27.973
- JENNA!
JENNA, STOP!

38:28.006 --> 38:31.610
JENNA! JENNA!

38:31.643 --> 38:33.479
DROP THE GUN!

38:33.512 --> 38:35.414
- JENNA!
JENNA, DROP THE GUN!

38:35.447 --> 38:38.850
- NO! NO!
- DROP THE GUN!

38:38.884 --> 38:42.354
- NO!
OH, NO.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.723
- ENOUGH!

38:44.756 --> 38:46.425
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

38:48.494 --> 38:51.497
THAT'S IT.
JUST PUT IT DOWN.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.435
- [laughing]
YOU CRAZY BITCH.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.770
I SHOULD'VE KILLED YOU
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.007
- JENNA!

39:02.040 --> 39:05.110
[gunshot]
- NO!

39:09.981 --> 39:12.884
- [soft moaning]

39:24.430 --> 39:28.534
I JUST--I JUST BOUGHT IT
OFF THE STREET.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.402
IT WAS EASY.

39:57.463 --> 40:00.466
