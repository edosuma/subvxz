10:06.997 --> 10:09.043
That Hal is so great.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.828
Too bad he's stuck
with that woman.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.656
[ as Arnold Schwarzenegger]:
That is right, Jay.
She never stops there.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.136
I will terminate her.

10:15.223 --> 10:18.052
You know who'd be
perfect for him? Ellie.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.010
She's just coming out
of that bad divorce.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.926
Stop. That is terrible.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.711
Hey, ask me for a burger
with cheese.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.582
I'll have a burger
with cheese.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.237
[ mimics Jack Nicholson]:
You can't handle the cheese.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.630
[ laughing]

10:30.717 --> 10:32.457
I'll introduce them.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.286
Ellie, this is Hal.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.940
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.333
So, Carol tells me you're
here on your own?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.422
Yeah, yeah.
My wife kicked me out.

10:40.509 --> 10:41.945
Oh, that's terrible.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.513
So, are... are you
out of the house?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.123
No, no, no. I'm sleeping
on the couch.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.995
But we're being smart
about it.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.649
I mean, no contact at all.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.912
I think it's for the best,
given our situation.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.131
Believe me, I know.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.438
Well, would you like
to join me in a drink?

10:56.525 --> 10:59.049
[ as Cary Grant]:
My, oh, my. Do you think
we'll both fit?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.051
[ laughs]

11:10.539 --> 11:14.064
It's so good to get out
and meet all you great people.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.762
I have a confession
to make.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.894
This is my first night
out in a long time.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.896
I've been kind
of a hermit lately.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.812
That was me, too, but now I wish
I hadn't waited this long.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.641
I had no idea there was
something so amazing

11:25.728 --> 11:27.208
right here on my block.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.949
Oh, Hal.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.038
Well, maybe we can do this
again sometime.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.258
Well, Phil and Jenny are having
a Mexican fiesta tomorrow.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.043
Are you asking me?

11:36.130 --> 11:37.784
Yeah, are you going?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.699
Sure.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.877
I'm sorry. I don't know how
to do this.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.966
Just say good night.

11:47.837 --> 11:48.925
Good night, Hal.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.666
Good night.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.758
Russell makes
a mean Singapore Sling.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.282
Oh, and you know that probate
lawyer, Mrs. Chaffley?

11:58.369 --> 12:00.371
The one who's always on my ass
about the lawn?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.982
Well, she can stand on her head

12:02.069 --> 12:04.419
and drink a pitcher of beer
in seven seconds.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.855
Glad you had a good time, Hal.

12:05.942 --> 12:09.119
We're doing fine
here, too.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.991
So, what do you wanna do now?

12:11.078 --> 12:12.775
You wanna Pizzazzle
some more?

12:12.862 --> 12:15.169
No, I'm kinda
Pizzazzled out.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.355
How about if I do your hair?

12:27.442 --> 12:29.531
Only if I get to do yours, too.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.838
BOTH:
Dizzeal!

12:38.279 --> 12:39.584
Thanks, little man.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.500
Aha! I see how you're doing it.

12:42.587 --> 12:43.719
You have a tack in your hand.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.243
Nope. That was just a pat
on the head.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.941
So you're pushing the soft spot?

12:48.028 --> 12:50.291
No, Reese. I'm just being nice.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.859
So he doesn't know when
the hit's gonna come.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.818
Reese, there's no trick.
I'm just showing him respect.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.125
You're not making any sense.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.256
Don't overthink it.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.737
Oh, I got it.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.565
No, wait. I don't.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.262
He's my little brother.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.047
I'm just treating him the way
I want to be treated.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.484
Show me
the hand thing again.

13:20.234 --> 13:24.020
♪ Wishing and hoping and
thinking and praying ♪

13:24.107 --> 13:29.547
♪ Praying and dreaming
each night of his charms ♪

13:29.634 --> 13:34.117
♪ That won't get you
into his arms ♪

13:34.204 --> 13:41.124
♪ So if you're looking to find
love you can share ♪

13:41.211 --> 13:46.216
♪ All you gotta do is hold him
and kiss him ♪

13:46.303 --> 13:48.566
♪ And love him
and show him... ♪

13:48.653 --> 13:52.222
Oh, Hal, the last few nights
have been so magical.

13:52.309 --> 13:55.617
The barbecue,
the disco party.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.010
Don't forget fondue night.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.707
I think I've gone up
a whole pant size.

13:58.794 --> 14:02.363
[ laughing]

14:02.450 --> 14:05.018
I think I'm falling
in love with someone.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.064
Wow, you know,
you're pretty great.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.718
It wouldn't surprise me
if he was

14:09.805 --> 14:11.763
falling in love with you, too.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.985
Well, good night.
Good night.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.337
Good for her.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.082
I can do
your nails again.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.345
I don't know what you could
possibly do to improve them.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.653
Well, we have
to do something.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.178
-Truth or Dare.
-Truth.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.876
What's the worse thing
you've ever done?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.616
Total immunity?

14:38.703 --> 14:40.270
Pinky swear.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.837
All right, well,

14:41.924 --> 14:43.665
I'm not sure
if this counts,

14:43.752 --> 14:45.188
but when the Harrises
were on vacation

14:45.275 --> 14:46.537
I drove their car
for a week.

14:46.624 --> 14:47.930
Malcolm!

14:48.017 --> 14:49.540
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

14:49.627 --> 14:50.846
They left their
window unlocked.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.239
And a lot of people leave
a spare car key

14:52.326 --> 14:53.327
in the kitchen drawer.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.024
Except the Goldmans.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.113
They left theirs in a fake soup
can in the cabinet.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.812
[ knocking]
Well, I'm off to Steve
and Carol's... again.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.814
Fine, Hal.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.295
Hey, you know that Ellie Johnson
down the street?

15:05.382 --> 15:07.123
She is a lot more fun
than you think.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.908
I think she found a fella.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.170
Good for her.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.825
Should be a great
party tonight.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.479
Steve's doing kabobs.

15:15.566 --> 15:19.527
Hal, I thought about it
and it's just... too soon.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.442
Well, they did say 7:30.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.706
I mean, I'm not... ready.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.273
I hope you understand.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.797
Well, if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.800
You have such an amazing
attitude, Hal.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.541
Don't ever lose that.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.370
So I guess
I should just go.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.938
Good-bye, Hal.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.113
Good...

15:40.200 --> 15:41.897
[ whispers]:
Good-bye, Ellie.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.861
Okay, now say something
nice to him.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.867
Like how you feel about
him, but only good stuff.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.566
I don't know. He's...

16:01.351 --> 16:02.962
...not that bad.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.659
Good. Now tell him that.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.576
You're not horrible like the
rest of those buttmunches.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.187
There you go. Now pat
him on the shoulder.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.756
It's like a slap, but slower.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.940
Good. Now see if
he'll get you a soda.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.333
Get me a soda!

16:26.420 --> 16:29.858
No, no. Do it with me.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.338
Would you mind...

16:33.775 --> 16:35.124
Would you mind...

16:35.211 --> 16:36.821
...getting me...

16:36.908 --> 16:38.171
...getting me...

16:38.258 --> 16:39.476
...a...

16:39.563 --> 16:40.564
...a...

16:40.651 --> 16:41.652
...soda?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.350
...soda?

16:45.134 --> 16:46.527
-You stupid...
-Nothing else.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.804
Wow. I just realized
I totally lost sight

17:02.891 --> 17:03.805
of what's really important.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.589
There you go.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.635
It's not that I like having
a slave getting me things.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.376
It's that I like
to have a slave

17:09.463 --> 17:11.508
so I can watch him suffer
while he gets me things.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.510
-What?
-The fact that I had
to ask for this

17:13.597 --> 17:15.512
makes it taste like bile.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.601
Thank you for helping me
figure that out.

17:18.906 --> 17:20.517
What was that for?

17:20.604 --> 17:22.911
Sorry, man. I had to get
the taste out of my mouth.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.307
I still can't believe
you ate that dead fly.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.699
Hey, I play for keeps.

17:28.786 --> 17:29.570
All right, truth or dare.

17:29.657 --> 17:30.919
Truth.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.094
Remember when I was
in fifth grade

17:32.181 --> 17:33.574
and I set the couch
on fire?

17:33.661 --> 17:35.315
How'd you know
it was me?

17:35.402 --> 17:37.839
I planted all that evidence,
I had Stevie as an alibi.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.449
Even Dad thought
it was Reese.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.625
Honestly?
I had no idea.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.192
You were the first
person I saw

17:43.279 --> 17:45.325
when I started yelling,
and you just crumbled.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.197
You werebluffing,
but you seemed so sure.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.720
Of course, I seemed sure.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.200
With you boys,

17:51.287 --> 17:53.289
if I showed the slightest
weakness or hesitation

17:53.376 --> 17:54.986
the whole thing falls apart.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.293
Half the time, I'm just going
on blind instinct.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.079
After all these years,
five kids, keeping up that act.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.167
That's gotta be exhausting.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.733
Tell me about it.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.127
Plenty of days I come
home tired from work.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.434
The last thing I wanna do
is be Lois.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.479
I guess I do the same thing.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.394
Sometimes when I come home
from school,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.092
I don't feel like arguing
with you.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.442
-But it's like that's my job.
-It's funny, isn't it?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.183
I bet half the time
if we knew what the other one

18:17.270 --> 18:18.923
was really thinking,
we'd just burst out laughing.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.186
We probably would.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.670
ALL:
Hal!

18:26.757 --> 18:27.802
Hi. Hey, guys.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.717
Hello. Hello. Hello.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.720
Hal!

18:32.807 --> 18:34.504
Where's Ellie?

18:34.591 --> 18:37.290
Oh, she said
she just wasn't ready.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.943
Oh, yeah.
Well, what a shame.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.555
But you know sometimes
people just

18:41.642 --> 18:42.947
cling to these relationships

18:43.034 --> 18:43.992
that don't make sense
to anybody else,

18:44.079 --> 18:46.168
right, Hal?

18:46.255 --> 18:47.213
What?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.953
Nothing.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.260
No, you clearly said something.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.088
What are you, what are you.
driving at?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.743
Well, it's just that,
you know,

18:55.830 --> 18:59.050
you're so fun
and Lois is so...

19:00.704 --> 19:02.315
Mojitos?

19:02.402 --> 19:04.273
No, no, mojitos.
You were saying something

19:04.360 --> 19:06.362
about my wife,
so let's just hear it.

19:08.538 --> 19:12.890
Well, um, this is nothing
against you, Hal,

19:12.977 --> 19:18.200
it's just that your wife
is kind of a...

19:18.287 --> 19:19.941
pill.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.813
What?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.989
[ chuckles]

19:25.076 --> 19:28.210
Well, maybe that's
your opinion, buddy,

19:28.297 --> 19:30.604
but that's not the opinion of
everyone else here, is it?

19:40.091 --> 19:42.093
So that's how it is, huh?

19:43.399 --> 19:45.314
Well, let me
tell you something.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.578
I think all of you people
are just jealous!

19:48.665 --> 19:51.755
My wife happens to be
the most wonderful,

19:51.842 --> 19:53.801
amazing, beautiful woman
in the world,

19:53.888 --> 19:56.673
and I don't care to eat with
anyone who thinks otherwise.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.519
See me cowering?
This is how a slave acts.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.218
You'll get it. We'll both
just have to be patient.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.523
Now, let's start
at the beginning.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.047
"No, I won't get
you a soda."

20:27.095 --> 20:29.053
Come on.
Put some wrist into it.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.142
Wait, you're missing my eye.
Get my eye.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.231
Oh, don't worry Hal,

20:32.318 --> 20:34.058
I'll take down
the rhinestones.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.147
No, leave them.
Last night was like

20:36.235 --> 20:38.715
making love
inside of a star.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.804
You know, Hal,
now that I'm feeling better

20:40.891 --> 20:42.502
you can take me to one
of those great parties.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.808
Oh, I don't think so, honey.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.810
I never really fit in
with those people.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.203
Well, if they don't
appreciate you,

20:48.290 --> 20:50.249
I don't want anything
to do with them.

20:51.946 --> 20:52.947
Oh, for the...!

20:53.034 --> 20:55.123
Who left the refrigerator open?

20:55.210 --> 20:56.255

21:02.478 --> 21:04.132
Mom, remember the...?

Oh, well, why don't you
just live on the street...

21:12.836 --> 21:14.882
and they end up turning
into criminals?

21:14.969 --> 21:17.014
...and see if a bunch of
strangers will give you free,
cold food?

21:17.101 --> 21:18.625
You have all your kids afraid
of you. Is that what you want?

21:18.712 --> 21:20.627
You want me to be afraid of you?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.281
You think everybody's
