NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.838
(gunshots)

00:04.921 --> 00:06.006
How long you been sitting on him?

00:06.089 --> 00:08.967
We grabbed him the next morning,
we figured your captain had the best read.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.594
You bastard. I never even thought
to ask you.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.762
I won't forgive you for this.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.224
Lieutenants Calletano and Hunter
take their captaincy exams.

00:16.307 --> 00:19.227
-Fourth, Howard. Fourth.
-Fourth?

00:19.310 --> 00:21.354
We got some dirty cops in Midtown.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.356
-Is that the guy that bites?
-Belker.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.816
I hear he's working that outlet
for the clothes--

00:24.899 --> 00:26.067
You writing a book?

00:26.151 --> 00:28.028
I just got off the phone
with my law professor,

00:28.111 --> 00:29.446
and he says this urinalysis thing

00:29.529 --> 00:31.448
is in violation
of our Fifth Amendment rights.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.367
They test for codeine in those samples,
I'm coming up positive.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.327
(gasps) I can't breathe.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.749
-MAN 1: Where's Jablonski?
-MAN 2: You all right, Sarge?

00:40.832 --> 00:44.711
Item one, come on, people.
Give me a chance!

00:44.794 --> 00:47.881
-(clamoring)
-Hey!

00:47.964 --> 00:49.215
All right!

00:49.299 --> 00:51.384
Hey, Sarge, all right!

00:52.552 --> 00:54.429
I got it. Thank you.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.514
All right.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.641
Okay, okay, item one.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.062
Item one, uh... Item one, uh...

01:05.732 --> 01:09.569
Okay, item one, rock houses.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.113
Uh, this is a memo from Division,

01:12.197 --> 01:14.199
with the word, apparently,
that the rock houses are moving

01:14.282 --> 01:16.451
to the second and third floor of premises.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
(groans)

01:17.660 --> 01:18.995
STAN: Whether Lieutenant Hunter's tank

01:19.079 --> 01:22.165
had anything to do with it
or not, it, uh-- it don't say.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.835
Anyway, keep your eyes peeled
for upstairs action.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.838
Problem's not gone,
just, uh, moved higher up.

01:29.589 --> 01:35.011
Uh, number two, your PBA has completed
marathon negotiations with department

01:35.095 --> 01:37.555
this a.m. on this, uh, urinalysis thing.

01:37.639 --> 01:42.477
Uh, they went to bat with a brief
prepared by our own Detective Garibaldi.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.312
-WOMAN: Okay, Harry!
-(chattering)

01:44.395 --> 01:48.650
All right, the upshot
is, um, the following accord.

01:48.733 --> 01:49.818
I'm quoting from the accord.

01:50.902 --> 01:55.740
"No disciplinary action will be taken
by Division against any individual

01:55.824 --> 01:59.327
"found in violation
of department drug policy

01:59.410 --> 02:01.788
as a result of the urinalysis test."

02:01.871 --> 02:05.416
-(applause)
-"However...

02:06.209 --> 02:09.462
"However, results of said tests
will be available

02:09.546 --> 02:12.549
"to said personnel's commanding officer

02:12.632 --> 02:15.510
for discretionary counseling
as warranted."

02:15.593 --> 02:17.178
What the hell does that mean?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.638
I don't know what that means.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.517
If it was up to Jabo, said personnel
would be out on said rear end.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.436
Item three. All right.
Item three, assignments.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.023
Dugan continues with LaRue and Washington
on wants and warrants

02:29.107 --> 02:30.692
except for this a.m., Neal.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.653
-They want you on Mendoza discovery.
-Aw, man.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.781
Also, yeah, Dailey rides with Fisher,

02:36.865 --> 02:38.867
Sergeant Bates is back with Coffey.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.828
I'm back riding the desk.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.622
Um, item four...

02:45.874 --> 02:46.708
Thank you.

02:46.791 --> 02:50.003
Item four, Detective Belker
requests a huddle

02:50.086 --> 02:51.337
with Mayo and Garibaldi,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.631
re: a possible backup situation.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.216
Item fi--

02:59.554 --> 03:00.471
Um...

03:01.306 --> 03:03.516
Captain Ralph Saperstein of Division Fraud

03:03.600 --> 03:07.604
expired yesterday, uh,
after a brief illness.

03:08.688 --> 03:13.193
Condolences to the family can be sent
to, um, Palisades Mortuary.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.237
Details of the memorial service
are posted upstairs.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.828
Uh, Hill and Renko,
I got a surprise for you.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.832
Grabowski and Marino
pulled an all-nighter last night

03:27.916 --> 03:30.418
at the Herr Hotel gas leak.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.171
So you're gonna have to ride
with Officer McBear.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.506
-Officer Mac what?
-McBear.

03:35.798 --> 03:39.510
He's this new symbol of law enforcement.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.930
He's a 400-pound black bear.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.433
He rides around in a cage
with his handler, Mr. Lowenhandler.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.478
You go around, you talk to kids like that.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.687
Does he talk?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
Well, he talks in those
comic books they got,

03:51.814 --> 03:54.275
but he don't really talk,
because he's a bear.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.737
-We got to ride in the car with a bear?
-RENKO: In the car with a bear?

03:57.820 --> 03:59.405
You're gonna meet him upstairs. Yeah.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.574
Go upstairs and talk to him. That's it.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.202
Let's go out there. Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.080
Why do we have to ride
in a car with a bear?

04:07.163 --> 04:08.539
Don't they have something,

04:08.623 --> 04:11.292
the bear goes in a cage
or something like that?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.671
-So what's the story? You all right?
-I'm fine. Don't make a big fuss.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.507
Well, the doctor said you're all right,
then, right?

04:17.590 --> 04:21.594
It was angina, which comes and goes
on rare occasions,

04:21.678 --> 04:23.054
but which is totally over with for now,

04:23.137 --> 04:25.139
and let's don't make
a big deal of it, okay?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.605
-(chattering)
-MAN: Let me see the bear!

04:32.689 --> 04:35.525
-Hey, check this out.
-Can you believe this?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.528
Look at the size of that thing!

04:40.405 --> 04:42.031
You really need to bring
him all the way in?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.908
(in German accent)
Officer McBear goes wherever I go.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.660
If I couldn't trust him,

04:45.743 --> 04:47.620
he wouldn't be much of a symbol
for law enforcement, now, would he?

04:47.704 --> 04:48.663
Are you the bear trainer?

04:49.539 --> 04:51.249
-Lowenhandler.
-Hill and Renko.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
He don't bite, do he?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.462
Him? Don't be silly. He's like a pussycat.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.465
-Y'all keep him inside of a cage?
-That's right.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.384
You'll have an easy day of it, believe me.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.763
We go wherever.
I unload the bear, pass out the funnies.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.350
Then I give the Officer McBear slide show,
answer any questions.

05:09.434 --> 05:14.314
All you do is you just stand there
and you read the speeches.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.941
They, uh, give a feeling
of law-enforcement partnership

05:17.025 --> 05:18.484
between you and Officer McBear.

05:18.568 --> 05:23.197
Isn't he the cutest fella you ever saw?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.118
(laughs)

05:28.536 --> 05:31.706
Did you know that you are the symbol
for the Soviet Union?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.166
I'll bet you didn't.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.084
Completely passive creatures,

05:35.168 --> 05:37.962
they've lived in civilization
for 300 years.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.298
You want a picture of yourself
with him there, Lieutenant?

05:40.965 --> 05:42.175
Oh, I'd be delighted.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.678
Big old bear.

05:46.137 --> 05:50.266
You can get rid of all your nasty old
troops in Afghanistan, shouldn't you?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.894
Yes. Yes, you should.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.354
Yes, you should.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.898
-That's a good old bear.
-(growling)

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362
-Why's he doing this to him?
-(clamoring)

06:02.445 --> 06:05.239
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:07.033
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:07.116 --> 06:11.079
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:11.162 --> 06:12.622
(sirens wailing)

06:18.086 --> 06:20.713
(theme music playing)

07:25.236 --> 07:26.320
Sergeant...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.949
-Sergeant, will you stop?
-What?

07:30.032 --> 07:31.826
I got better things
to do than run down patients

07:31.909 --> 07:33.911
who sneak out of the hospital
without telling a nurse.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.371
You told me it was nothing.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.914
I said it was probably angina,

07:36.998 --> 07:39.750
but I also said I wanted you
under observation for 24 hours.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.212
Look, I get it from time to time.
I live with it, okay?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.465
You're probably right.
In fact, I'm almost sure you're right.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.300
I got a stationhouse to run here.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.970
Look, how about you come back in, let me
run another enzyme series, another EKG.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.431
Everything checks out,
I get you released by tonight, 5:00 p.m.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.599
Nothin' doing.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.142
I got better things to do than sitting
around on my butt in a hospital.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.310
Okay, Okay.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.686
-Then sign.
-Why?

07:58.769 --> 08:00.313
Released against physician's orders.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.024
I can't be responsible if you're not
gonna take my best counsel on this.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.234
I'll probably bury you.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.737
Sergeant, you probably will.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.781
Patsy's telling everybody
you're a bum in the sack.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.074
You lie, LaRue.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.785
Yeah, yeah, but my basic premise
is correct then, am I right?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.205
Huh? That as of this a.m.,
you would have knowledge in this area?

08:17.288 --> 08:18.998
-Man, are you obnoxious.
-What? What?

08:19.081 --> 08:20.750
Good morning, Leo.
Is Detective Belker around?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.293
Right. He's waiting for you.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.797
-You smell a little beary, Howard.
-(laughs)

08:26.881 --> 08:28.424
From my encounter with old Klaus, huh?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.927
I rather like the musky scent myself.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.723
It's a pity about Captain Saperstein
expiring, huh, Raymundo?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.851
-Yes, it is a terrible shame.
-Fifty-two years young.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.562
It does peg you up a notch
on the captain's list.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.691
If this is how it would have to be,
I'd rather not make captain.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.569
Oh, come on,<i> amigo.</i>

08:48.653 --> 08:51.405
Death or retirement
of an existing<i> capitán,</i>

08:51.489 --> 08:54.450
how else are we going to arrive
in the promised land?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.370
-Promotion of a captain to commander.
-(sighs)

08:57.870 --> 08:59.121
Of course.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.500
Promotion of a captain
to one of the six commander slots

09:02.583 --> 09:04.168
in the entire department.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.421
You think it's a big joke,
guy dropping dead in the prime of life?

09:07.505 --> 09:10.174
Why don't you go down to the morgue,
get yourself some real belly laughs?

09:10.258 --> 09:13.511
Sergeant, you misunderstand.
I am heartsick.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.512
Phooey.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.265
Henry.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.643
This one definitely.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.812
Let me go back to this other array.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.401
-This one.
-Flynn and Sampson.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.070
I'd prefer to hold the bust,
see who else walks in.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.613
No argument, uh...

09:33.531 --> 09:35.366
We have information.
I saw a guy walking out of here

09:35.449 --> 09:37.535
who worked with Flynn
in Keenan's office five, six years ago.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.536
Phil Dugan.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.705
Yeah, I remember the pairing off
the Keenan investigation.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.790
-Probably coincidence.
-Let's keep Dugan out of it.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.458
By me, he's a wise guy anyway.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.418
Do it.

09:50.256 --> 09:54.844
Stan, I'll want to see Creighton,
O'Connell, and Washington.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.971
-Harry, my office.
-Creighton ain't in yet.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.973
Third time in a month
that bum's been late.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.808
What's up?

10:03.352 --> 10:04.562
(clears throat)

10:07.898 --> 10:09.734
You tested positive for marijuana, Harry.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.818
Wait a minute. Are you kidding?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.236
Do I look as if I'm kidding?

10:13.404 --> 10:15.072
Trace level of cannabis.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.159
Captain, we just spent 14 hours
getting an agreement

10:18.242 --> 10:20.036
that those test results
are not gonna be used.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.581
This isn't a legal chess game, Harry.
I'm talking to you man to man.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.374
I don't trust a cop who smokes reefer.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.252
You're on notice.
If I have cause to question your behavior,

10:28.336 --> 10:29.420
I'm gonna have you transferred.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.047
Fine. I'm not gonna sit still for this.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.555
-(sighs) Neal.
-Harry didn't seem too happy.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.600
Um... (clears throat)

10:45.144 --> 10:48.814
-You're positive for codeine, Neal.
-Hey, I got a scrip, Captain.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.401
Yeah, but it's not department-issued.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.737
You were taken off
the cleared-from-medication lists

10:54.820 --> 10:55.946
18 months ago.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.240
Took myself off, Captain.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.369
The department doc,
he wanted to put me on the desk,

11:01.452 --> 11:04.330
so I told him the knee was okay,
I didn't need the medication anymore.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.623
Started seeing your own guy.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.625
Mm-hmm.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.337
Neal, do you know what would have happened
if you'd been doing this two years ago

11:11.420 --> 11:12.797
when you were officer involved?

11:13.172 --> 11:16.425
I mean, the kind of lawsuit the department
and you would have been facing?

11:16.801 --> 11:17.968
Serious numbers.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.721
You can't be taking
this behind the department's back.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.686
The knee's worse than it's ever been,
Captain.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.979
It's got calcium. It's all arthritic.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.940
If I go to the department docs now,

11:31.023 --> 11:33.067
-I'll be lucky to get a desk.
-(knock on door)

11:37.947 --> 11:38.948
Furillo.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.453
It was all within the agreement.
I was talking to him man to man.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.247
You in the office?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.083
-Stay there.
-(receiver clicks)

11:50.668 --> 11:51.919
We'll talk about this later, okay?

11:52.002 --> 11:54.839
It's okay, Captain. I get the message.
I'll work it out.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.343
HENRY: Yes. Yes, I do.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.346
Yeah, well, tell Mr. Greenglass, Esquire

12:02.430 --> 12:04.682
that I'm not authorizing
payment of this bill.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.726
That I'm the executor
of Miss Scrignoli's estate,

12:06.809 --> 12:08.769
not some Santa Claus for shysters,

12:08.853 --> 12:11.147
and if he's got a problem with that,
he can come see me.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.899
So now, boys and girls, you see how it is.

12:13.983 --> 12:19.905
That Officer McBear here has captured
the burglar and the dope pusher,

12:20.197 --> 12:22.533
puts them inside of the van
and waves goodbye to 'em

12:22.616 --> 12:24.118
'cause they're on their way
to Hill Street Station.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.162
So let's all wave goodbye
to Officer McBear.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.873
Bye, Officer McBear. Say it with me.

12:28.956 --> 12:32.460
ALL: Goodbye, Officer McBear!

12:32.543 --> 12:34.545
-Bye, Officer McBear.
-Bye, Officer McBear!

12:34.962 --> 12:36.881
Read here. "Goodbye, Officer McBear."

12:36.964 --> 12:41.469
Um, goodbye to the pushers
and goodbye to the muggers.

12:41.552 --> 12:46.807
And as time has come for Officer McBear
to wave goodbye to you, too,

12:47.308 --> 12:50.519
he just wants you to remember
these simple rules of safety.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.733
Always cross at the signal
and always look both ways.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.486
Never accept a ride from a stranger.

12:58.569 --> 13:04.241
And if a grown-up ever bothers you,
tell your parents or tell a policeman.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.160
And, um... um...

13:06.243 --> 13:11.290
(chuckling) ...they'll tell your friend,
Officer McBear.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.792
Sing this rest part.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.128
-What?
-Sing the next part. Sing it.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.297
Um...

13:18.380 --> 13:22.051
<i>♪ Officer McBear is always there ♪</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:25.137
<i>♪ Give the call McBear, McBear ♪</i>

13:25.763 --> 13:29.350
<i>♪ And let the crooks beware, beware ♪</i>

13:29.850 --> 13:31.894
Thank you, Officer Hill, Officer Renko.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.023
And thank you, boys and girls.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.444
And now if anybody has any questions
about our friend Officer McBear,

13:40.861 --> 13:41.987
I'll be happy to answer them.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.697
Yeah. Is that a real bear?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.366
Uh, yeah, it's a real bear.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.742
A grizzly bear?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.160
No, no, it's a black bear.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.662
What kind of bear is he?

13:49.745 --> 13:51.080
(laughter)

13:51.163 --> 13:52.456
Well, he looks like a bear.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.875
Your mama teach you no manners there, pal?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.586
Is he old enough to hit?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.630
And now, if there are no more questions...

13:59.713 --> 14:01.006
(laughter)

14:01.090 --> 14:02.675
Ew, gross!

14:03.592 --> 14:06.554
-(laughter)
-(Officer McBear groaning)

14:07.137 --> 14:10.599
Renko, remember what it is that bears
do in the woods?

14:11.100 --> 14:11.976
Oh, Lord.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.853
He's getting too old for this.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.940
All right, children, up, up.
Follow me. Single line.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.401
He's nearly senile.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.736
Next, it'll be diapers.
Then it's no dignity.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.988
Keep the kids away from the bear.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.156
-I'll go get the scooper.
-Yeah, sure.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.491
Talk about dignity,

14:27.575 --> 14:30.536
why don't you pass these out,
Officer McBear?

14:31.745 --> 14:32.872
(laughs)

14:32.955 --> 14:34.957
I said nothing to Garibaldi
about sanctions,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.710
nothing about department
or precinct discipline.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.421
You told the man he was
on his back, Frank.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.465
You're looking to ship him out.
It's against the agreement's spirit.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.509
The agreement you made stinks.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.638
(sighs) The city screwed up, okay?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.975
The city attorney's opinion,
we were looking at a lawsuit.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.518
Your man Garibaldi called us on it.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.021
Now, Frank, we don't want to look

14:57.104 --> 14:59.815
like we persecute
the whistle-blowers, right?

15:00.399 --> 15:03.652
-Right.
-So we leave Garibaldi be, hmm?

15:03.736 --> 15:04.612
Okay.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.323
Oh, while I have you here,

15:07.406 --> 15:10.034
still in the department
of the comedy of errors,

15:10.492 --> 15:14.538
someone ran some of these samples.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.749
-Alcohol.
-And?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.043
And yours showed trace positive.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.255
The amount was so small, anyone else,
I wouldn't have give it a second thought.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.214
Then don't.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.677
Well, must be some new thinking on that.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.931
Didn't that used to be a no-no
for fellas with your problem?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.894
Frank, uh, these are all
gonna be eighty-sixed.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.355
I just wanted you to see
this report gets special handling.

15:39.438 --> 15:44.276
Your report will get
the Briscoe special disposal.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.402
Okay.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.654
Okay, Frank?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.156
There's nothing to worry about?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.533
Frank, I don't have to worry

15:51.617 --> 15:53.494
that this is some kind
of a trouble signal here?

15:54.078 --> 15:55.162
I have to go, Warren.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.417
Okay. I'll, uh... I'll see you later.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.144
-Got a minute?
-Sure.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.272
-I got an idea.
-What's that?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.692
Lunch, you and me, tar beach.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.820
The roof, just the two of us.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.490
-People go up there?
-We'll lock the door.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.992
Oh, sure, and put on a show

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
for all the people
in the Franklin Arms across the street.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.036
Sounds lovely.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.039
Okay, okay. How 'bout the boiler room?

16:39.999 --> 16:43.794
You're a sick man.
Flattering, but I'll have to pass.

16:43.877 --> 16:47.089
-How 'bout lunch?
-I can't. I'm waiting on a call, backup.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.340
Is that Belker's thing?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.677
He seems to run on schedules
like an airline. You know that.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.971
What's the big deal with him?

16:54.388 --> 16:56.181
Doing some kind of<i> French Connection</i>
or something?

16:57.307 --> 16:58.142
Maybe dinner.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.196
Minute, Frank?

17:14.783 --> 17:16.076
You look like I'm supposed to look.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.247
-We okay, Henry?
-You and me?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.167
You hid it from me, Frank.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.221
When Gina was killed,

17:36.805 --> 17:37.806
it was like...

17:39.475 --> 17:41.685
my only chance in the world was gone.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.856
And I've been...

17:47.107 --> 17:49.610
bitter and furious...

17:50.694 --> 17:52.863
and unforgiving of everything and everyone

17:52.946 --> 17:56.033
I imagined stood in the way of my revenge.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.826
-Like me.
-Like you. But...

17:59.078 --> 18:01.872
There is no revenge, Frank.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.416
Not on Sonny Murdo.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.418
I looked at him yesterday.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.172
The guy's got no more
moral sense than the sink.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.593
And no revenge on you.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.972
You did what you thought was right.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.892
-And out of friendship.
-I won't agree with that, Frank,

18:21.975 --> 18:24.019
but I know it wasn't out of malice.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.065
So...

18:29.942 --> 18:31.276
I'm okay if you're okay.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.154
(door opens)

18:34.238 --> 18:37.116
Uh, there you are, Lieutenant.
Lawyer named Greenglass to see you.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.075
Yeah, I'll see him.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.285
(door closes)

18:45.958 --> 18:47.918
I tell you she made me
executor of her will?

18:50.796 --> 18:51.880
Thankless job.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.969
Not too bad. Most of the dough's
in a trust for her mother.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.067
Mr. Greenglass.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.361
(raspy voiced) Oh, apologies, Lieutenant.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.991
Lost my voice.
I've been yelling at the girls so hard.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.994
-But we got it all straightened out.
-Oh, good.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.788
She was billing on the hourly basis.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.040
I say to her, "Ruthie, sweetness,

19:27.124 --> 19:30.961
since when do we bill hours
on a $40,000 estate?"

19:31.044 --> 19:33.839
I say to her,
"We got Lieutenant Goldblume here,

19:33.922 --> 19:36.842
"a scrupulous and conscientious executor.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.136
Of course he's gonna scream."

19:39.219 --> 19:43.765
I say to her further, "The bulk
of the estate is in a trust for the mama."

19:43.849 --> 19:47.436
She says, well, she didn't know.
Nobody told her.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.398
I further reminded her,
as I pointed out to you, Lieutenant,

19:51.773 --> 19:56.069
the name Scrignoli,
among our local IRS personnel,

19:56.153 --> 19:59.448
is often confused
with the stigma "tax dodger."

19:59.531 --> 20:02.618
-Meaning?
-Meaning tax audits, Lieutenant.

20:02.701 --> 20:06.246
Meaning hours of preparation,
hours of argument.

20:06.330 --> 20:10.417
All the time, the meter running.
Click, clickity-click.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.252
Pretty soon, it's like total vultures

20:12.336 --> 20:15.088
are eating at the carcass
of Mrs. Scrignoli's estate.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.717
-Which is definitely not what we want.
-Of course not.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.805
We're charging you
where we should have all along

20:23.889 --> 20:26.475
on the standard flat retainer.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.562
Local bar recommends 30 percent
to 35 percent.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.813
We take 28 percent.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.484
Twenty-eight percent of $40,000
is over $10,000.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.029
Believe me,
it's a big fraction less than the hours.

20:39.488 --> 20:44.409
Look, if this wasn't Paulie's widow,
I'd be out of it right now, Lieutenant.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.371
These residual estates
are like a crucifixion.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.834
But I do it out of loyalty and friendship.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.544
Twenty-eight percent.

20:57.547 --> 20:58.966
Excuse me, Captain.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.342
I don't know if this means anything,

21:00.425 --> 21:02.302
but I thought I should
come to you with it.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.597
What?

21:06.640 --> 21:10.978
Well, it doesn't seem like a lot,
but this guy from Midtown, Phil Dugan,

21:11.561 --> 21:13.730
he's been asking me questions
about Belker's undercover,

21:13.814 --> 21:17.526
whether...
if the operation was after cops.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.195
-What did you tell him?
-I said I didn't know.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.156
-Was he persistent?
-A little.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.954
I feel funny about this.
I-- I like the guy. I went out with him.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.957
But the thing is, I checked with Midtown,

21:32.040 --> 21:34.126
and it seems he was partnered
for two years

21:34.209 --> 21:35.752
with a Detective Sampson.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.380
Yeah, that was the guy Belker made
yesterday. Where's Dugan now?

21:38.463 --> 21:40.757
-I don't know. He went out.
-J.D.?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.511
Listen, take Neal
and Harry and find Belker.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.014
Tell him to take
whatever we have now today.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.808
-I mean, within an hour.
-Right.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.646
Captain, if nothing ever comes of this,
if Dugan's not involved...

21:54.730 --> 21:57.316
No reason for him to hear
about this conversation at all.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.109
Thank you.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.832
I heard they arrested Gina's killer.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.168
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.547
I thought about her last night
when I heard about the arrest.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.176
I was remembering
when we were in the ladies' room just...

22:26.053 --> 22:28.847
She was telling me about how
she loved to cook for you.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.309
She was being real sweet, real excited.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.313
In fact, she even gave me this recipe
for her bread pudding,

22:36.396 --> 22:38.273
you know, with honey and raisins.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.983
And last night, I was trying to come up

22:40.067 --> 22:42.736
with something different for the kids,
something not chocolate.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.030
I remembered her bread pudding.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.701
You know, she had been so clear
when she was talking about it,

22:49.785 --> 22:51.495
about describing how to do it

22:52.496 --> 22:54.706
that I just went right in
the kitchen and made it.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.001
-It was delicious.
-Yeah.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.420
She made it for me a few times.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.882
You feel like having dinner tonight?

23:05.342 --> 23:06.551
No, I don't think...

23:10.806 --> 23:11.807
Yeah.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.725
That'd be good.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.268
I'll make a reservation.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.813
I'm a dangerous man
to go to a restaurant with.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.399
I'll take my chances.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.154
-Officer McBear, ladies and gentlemen.
-Step back, all right?

23:26.238 --> 23:29.950
-(overlapping chatter)
-Here, take a flyer.

23:30.033 --> 23:33.245
Follow Officer McBear's ten tips
for a safer, smarter you. Take one.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.539
BOBBY: Sir, step back.
All right, everybody, step back.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.290
I thought the bear
was supposed to be a symbol

23:37.374 --> 23:38.875
for forest fires, not crime.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.919
He's a symbol to<i> prevent </i>forest fires.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.004
RENKO: He is a new symbol
of law enforcement.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.005
Flyer?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.842
Some symbol.
He looks pretty stupid in that hat.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.051
You sound pretty stupid.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.345
Why don't you just shut up
and leave Mr. McBear alone?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.139
-Just go, all right?
-(tires screeching)

23:52.681 --> 23:55.517
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, shit.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.352
Are you blind, lady?
Look what you just did!

23:57.436 --> 23:58.645
I'm sorry!

23:58.728 --> 24:00.814
This is an official vehicle.
Do you know that?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.442
My insurance! You know,
I work for a living, lady.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.610
Sir, just step back.
Ma'am, license and registration, please.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.653
You had the whole--

24:06.736 --> 24:09.573
-Why did you do that?
-Sir, just relax, all right?

24:09.656 --> 24:13.660
-License and registration.
-Don't do that to that bear, you jerk!

24:13.743 --> 24:18.790
-(Officer McBear growling)
-(man screams)

24:18.874 --> 24:21.418
Oh, my God! He's gonna kill me!

24:21.501 --> 24:23.170
Officer McBear!

24:23.253 --> 24:27.466
(indistinct shouting)

24:27.549 --> 24:29.759
I told you not to mess around
with that bear, boy.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.387
(indistinct shouting)

24:37.017 --> 24:38.143
I don't want to have to do this.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.314
-Get back!
-(clamoring)

24:42.397 --> 24:43.857
Help me!

24:43.940 --> 24:46.568
One, two... three.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.153
(growling)

24:48.236 --> 24:50.071
-You killed him!
-I only shot him in the arm.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.531
Somebody get an ambulance!

24:52.240 --> 24:53.617
(clamoring)

24:53.700 --> 24:56.119
Oh, he mauled my arm! He tried to kill me!

24:56.203 --> 24:58.205
He tried to kill me!

24:58.288 --> 25:02.125
-Somebody get an ambulance!
-Officer McBear has to get to surgery.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.169
(siren wailing)

25:13.637 --> 25:16.097
All right, that's $15.

25:16.973 --> 25:20.560
-Did the stain come out of my pantsuit?
-You could hardly see it.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.188
Be with you fellas in a second.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.399
Well, y'all didn't do a very good job.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.653
We're dry cleaners, lady, not magicians.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.988
Well, you don't have to be so rude.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.698
Well, you don't have to be such a slob.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.618
You tell Mr. Berman
I ain't never gonna come here no more.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.291
Uh, where's the old guy?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.210
He's across the street having lunch.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.421
Well, uh, did he leave something for us?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.799
He said we could come in,
pick up some suits.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.884
Mr. Berman
said I should give you a fitting.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.886
I got your suits right over here.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.515
-That the flannel pinstripe?
-This is it.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.977
-Oh, nice.
-Fitting room's right over there.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.272
And we got one right
behind it for you, sir.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.942
-Where's that?
-Right back there.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.111
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

26:12.112 --> 26:12.946
(door opens, bell rings)

26:24.082 --> 26:25.250
Go!

26:25.333 --> 26:26.501
-Hands up! You're busted!
-Hey, occupied.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.337
-It's a bust, huh?
-He's got a gun!

26:29.421 --> 26:30.839
(grunting)

26:33.425 --> 26:35.468
-(gunshot)
-(Neal screams)

26:35.552 --> 26:36.720
(grunting)

26:36.803 --> 26:39.472
-Damn! Damn! It just hurts.
-How bad? How bad?

26:39.556 --> 26:43.852
-You got him? I'm gonna get Neal to Mercy.
-I think it just grazed me or something.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.937
What the hell is this? This is crazy.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.606
I thought you guys
were trying to rob the place.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.649
-Yeah.
-I'm telling you, this is not a crime.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.693
This was an investigation of a crime.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.208
-Listen, man, I'm gonna grab a smoke.
-Be right with you, baby.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.295
He's okay, Captain.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.172
Are we leaning on the bastards
that shot him?

27:12.255 --> 27:13.423
That's what I understand.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.634
WOMAN (over PA):<i> Dr. Quibachek,</i>

27:15.717 --> 27:17.927
<i>please report to the nurse's station</i>
<i>in five west.</i>

27:18.011 --> 27:18.845
Captain...

27:19.804 --> 27:22.849
Codeine tie you up, Detective?
Make you constipated?

27:22.932 --> 27:24.184
Not too bad, Doc.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.769
All right, every six hours
till the pain goes.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.979
-Thanks, Doc.
-How you feel?

27:28.688 --> 27:31.107
It hurts some. It's okay, though.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.610
Long way to go to get
a pain scrip, huh, Captain?

27:33.693 --> 27:36.071
Fact is, it'll buy you some time.
I hope you'll use it.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.781
I'm willing if the knee is, Captain.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.076
-Why don't you take the rest of the day?
-Ain't over with till the paper's in.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.243
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.120
-You can throw your shirt on.
-Okay.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.498
No, ma'am, it's my understanding

27:46.581 --> 27:48.583
that the animal
was endangering a man's life

27:48.667 --> 27:50.043
when the officer intervened.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.045
No, the bear is not dead.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.298
Now, you want to call the ASPCA,
there's nothing I can do to stop you.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.677
-Captain, how's Neal?
-Just grazed.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.180
-Renko shot Officer McBear.
-Oh, terrific.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.391
It was on account of the bear
mauled a curious citizen.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.142
Plus, we got Flynn in lineup.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.186
Flynn sounds like he knows
what he's talking about.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.439
-Come on.
-Sampson, however, is a moron.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.526
And the owner's down in garden level
having a nervous breakdown.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.113
Detective Flynn, Attorney Griglia,
Captain Furillo.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.908
Captain,
if we're in a horse race with Sampson,

28:21.991 --> 28:24.494
please know that my client's ready to run.

28:24.911 --> 28:25.745
Let's hear it.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.874
Plead to the "E" felony,
await the probation report.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.251
Okay.

28:33.586 --> 28:37.716
Uh, the guy's been boosting

28:38.007 --> 28:42.554
maybe 100-grand designer garments a month

28:43.471 --> 28:45.473
and laying it off
to establishments on the Hill.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.227
Uh, we, as a group,

28:50.019 --> 28:53.940
we've been taking small potatoes,
wardrobe requirements...

28:55.358 --> 28:58.737
Plus ten grand split seven ways.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.117
Dugan, uh...
Phil Dugan's the wheel man on this.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.413
Get a stenographer.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.671
No, one of our officers
did not kill Smokey the Bear.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.758
You're misinformed.
Plus, we got a cop shot here today, lady.

29:19.841 --> 29:24.345
Captain. Captain, we got these messages
off of Flynn's desk from Dugan.

29:24.846 --> 29:25.972
Flynn just named him.

29:26.473 --> 29:30.435
I'll try to find somebody to talk to you.
Natalie, will you take these bear calls?

29:30.518 --> 29:32.228
I'm going Scroogy with this.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.942
Oh, Raymundo, I heard some interesting
poop at lunch today.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.862
Captain Grayson
is announcing his retirement.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.656
-Where you hear this?
-From sources at Polk Avenue.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.741
Is this true?

29:44.824 --> 29:47.368
Yeah, he has a medical disability
spinally related.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.496
Now, imagine that, Raymundo.

29:49.579 --> 29:54.417
Saperstein passes on, Grayson goes down,
and in two ticks, all of a sudden,

29:54.501 --> 29:57.629
you are<i> numero dos</i>
on the captain's list with a bullet.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.298
This is terrible. These poor men.

30:00.673 --> 30:04.010
It is a dreadful way to advance
as a result of another's misfortune.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.304
-Beep, beep, beep!
-What's that?

30:06.387 --> 30:09.349
-Bullcrap detector.
-Come on. Stop that.

30:09.682 --> 30:12.101
-Imagine.
-Oh, come on,<i> compadre.</i>

30:12.185 --> 30:14.562
-The man retired. He didn't die.
-So?

30:15.146 --> 30:18.441
So, get your attitude straight.
This is good news.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.653
-I mean, you're allowed to enjoy it.
-So I'm happy. So what?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.281
Well, I know I would be.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.534
Moves me up to 13th.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.382
-Phil, you're busted.
-Lame joke, John.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.758
Not a joke at all, Phil.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.223
I think you better convene a summit.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.022
We need to know what you're offering.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.234
No, no, Mr. Bernstein,
I need to know what<i> you're </i>offering.

31:01.943 --> 31:05.321
We have Sampson and Flynn.
We don't need you, Dugan.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.156
Yeah, sure, you don't need me...

31:07.907 --> 31:09.826
If you want to leave Midtown a cesspool.

31:10.785 --> 31:14.330
Hear no evil and see no evil,
is that how it goes, Furillo?

31:15.748 --> 31:18.668
Look, you don't want to know,
let me walk out of here.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.296
-Be specific.
-You want specific?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.715
Captain Joe Keenan.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.509
-That specific enough for you?
-What about Keenan?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.512
Not till I hear
I'm strolling out of here, Jack.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.180
That's the deal.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.017
I'm not asking to stay on the force.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.895
But I walk... period.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.062
With Keenan, you understand

31:38.146 --> 31:42.692
that means he's bound up,
delivered, convicted.

31:42.775 --> 31:44.277
Maybe it flies, hmm?

31:45.904 --> 31:49.198
-We have to talk, Warren.
-Sure. Take your time.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.541
This deal doesn't float.
I won't approve it.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.378
Well, thank you, Mr. President
of the Joe Keenan Fan Club.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.881
Frank, Dugan is a broom,

32:04.964 --> 32:07.425
and we're gonna sweep a floor
of Division with this guy.

32:07.508 --> 32:10.219
Oh, yeah? Sweep it how?
By letting Phil Dugan walk?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.805
Phil Dugan, who conspired to get
one of my men whacked?

32:12.889 --> 32:15.725
Conspired? How?

32:15.808 --> 32:20.271
With these messages on Flynn's desk.
"Contact Dugan at Hill Street, urgent."

32:20.355 --> 32:22.482
"Contact Dugan before you go up."

32:22.565 --> 32:25.401
So he was trying to tip him off.
I'm not questioning that, Frank.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.569
Then Washington got shot.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.239
Not because of Dugan, Frank.
The messages never got through.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.410
All right, we'll apologize to Washington.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.871
No, we won't apologize
to Washington, Warren.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.749
You know how guys like Keenan get started?

32:40.500 --> 32:46.255
With the same penny-ante, big fish,
little fish, lazy, cynical attitude

32:46.339 --> 32:49.092
about who did what, about justice,

32:49.175 --> 32:52.220
about go for the guys
who make the headlines at any cost.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.348
That's lousy police work.
That's ground-level corruption.

32:55.431 --> 32:56.474
So what are you saying, Frank?

32:56.557 --> 32:59.394
I'm saying that Dugan will take a felony,
and he'll talk anyway.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.063
Irwin, if I don't get at least this much,
I'm not gonna be able to look

33:02.146 --> 33:05.566
at a single man or woman in this precinct
and say, "Go out there and do your job."

33:07.485 --> 33:09.570
Mr. D.A., would you excuse us?

33:18.037 --> 33:20.498
I've had enough of this crap, Furillo.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.251
We're gonna give Dugan what he needs.

33:24.293 --> 33:28.006
Dugan has to take a felony,
and Dugan has to do time.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.050
You're so damn worried
how you look to your men, hmm?

33:31.884 --> 33:34.929
Well, how do you think you're gonna look
if that drinking leaks, hmm?

33:35.763 --> 33:37.265
If it leaks, it leaks, Warren.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.142
Dugan doesn't walk.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.438
Save me from the damn puritans.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.700
Here's where you stand, Phil.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.785
We're all in agreement here.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.163
You got no friends in this room.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.665
Brought 'em over, huh, Furillo?

34:05.710 --> 34:07.962
Sampson and Flynn
are in a carded division.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.131
Your edge is to talk now.

34:10.757 --> 34:14.177
-They can't give you half what I can.
-That's very naive, Phil.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.138
You can take an "E" felony
or reckless endangerment

34:17.597 --> 34:20.641
or anything up to and including conspiracy
to commit murder.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.269
One way or another,
you're gonna be charged with a felony.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.939
(whistles) You boys
are in some mood today, huh?

34:27.023 --> 34:28.274
You have something to tell us?

34:28.357 --> 34:29.484
Yeah.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.446
-Joe Keenan.
-That's not very articulate.

34:33.905 --> 34:37.700
We need a full statement
and grand-jury testimony

34:37.784 --> 34:39.911
and trial-jury testimony
if it goes that far.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.210
There's not one pad in Midtown.
There's four.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.254
Above that's superpad.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.591
Skims off all of them. That's Keenan's.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.969
And he's got a hit squad to keep
the enforcement going.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.556
There's a hit squad in the department?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.058
To keep the enforcement.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.103
Keep everything nice and quiet.

35:05.770 --> 35:06.771
Yeah.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.440
Keenan's hit squad.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.028
(door opens)

35:15.113 --> 35:17.865
We got a fire here, Frank.
I'm calling Daniels.

35:18.699 --> 35:21.619
J.D., Lieutenant Shipman is gonna need you
on a bust downtown.

35:21.702 --> 35:22.995
As soon as Briscoe's off the phone.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.164
-Who we busting?
-Captain Joe Keenan.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.429
What's up now, Mr. Greenglass?

35:40.763 --> 35:43.391
It's like the old joke,
I got good news and bad news.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.938
The bad news is you can't be executor
of Gina Scrignoli's estate.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.148
Why not?

35:50.231 --> 35:53.317
Because the good news is how's it feel
to be a millionaire?

35:53.734 --> 35:55.069
You're asking the wrong guy.

35:57.905 --> 35:58.948
I am, am I?

36:05.204 --> 36:09.041
These are the contents
of a certain overlooked safe-deposit box,

36:09.750 --> 36:14.213
West Indian Bank deposit books
totaling $1.05 million,

36:15.631 --> 36:18.843
handwritten codicil
to Gina Scrignoli's estate

36:18.926 --> 36:21.262
naming you beneficiary of these funds.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.061
I thought she gave everything
to her mother.

36:29.687 --> 36:33.733
Everything till what we surprisingly
uncovered this afternoon, Lieutenant.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.611
Believe me, every Scrignoli estate's
been like this,

36:36.694 --> 36:37.695
like rats' nests.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.200
The man was like a rat with his money.
Barbados, Curacao.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.869
Point being,
there's got to be a new executor.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.538
You can't be beneficiary
as well as executor.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.582
A million dollars?

36:50.041 --> 36:53.377
Less my percentage retainer,
of course, 28 percent.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.671
Which you just managed to get me to sign

36:55.755 --> 36:57.757
before you found a million dollars
floating around.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.344
Now, Lieutenant,
there's a hardness in that accusation.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.512
My Ruthie was with me
when we opened the box.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.348
We were totally amazed together.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.515
Cute.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.351
Lieutenant, you don't realize

37:08.434 --> 37:11.103
what the IRS has got
in store for both of us yet.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.898
Believe me, you want a motivated partner.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.150
I don't need a partner, Mr. Greenglass.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.904
And since I'm no longer Gina's executor,

37:19.987 --> 37:21.656
that piece of paper
you conned me into signing

37:21.739 --> 37:22.782
is probably worthless.

37:22.865 --> 37:23.908
Now, wait--

37:23.991 --> 37:26.077
It's out of my hands.
Take it up with the new executor.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.291
That's the problem with money, Lieutenant.

37:34.001 --> 37:37.380
No sooner you get it than you think people
are stealing it from you.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.595
Captain, the next time those court cops

37:44.679 --> 37:47.515
try to pick up a prisoner
without proper release forms,

37:47.598 --> 37:48.683
they are not getting them.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.435
I don't care if they holler
till they're blue in the face.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.898
Uh, can we talk, Stan?

37:57.483 --> 38:00.069
We got nothing to talk about.
I'm trying to run a squad room.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.821
We have something to talk about.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.532
You checked out of that hospital without
getting permission from your doctor.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.284
I have a message
to that effect right here.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.952
Don't talk to me like I was your grandpa.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.287
Calm down, Stan.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.207
What did the doctor tell you?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.168
What do you think he told me?

38:18.379 --> 38:19.422
I'm old, okay?

38:20.089 --> 38:21.090
Okay?

38:21.882 --> 38:22.842
He told me I'm old.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.012
-What did he say specifically?
-Nothing.

38:27.930 --> 38:28.848
Take it easy.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.018
Rocking chair, take it easy.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.354
-Retirement?
-I should think about it.

38:36.689 --> 38:37.690
What does he know?

38:38.858 --> 38:41.694
It's a touch of angina.
Okay, I'll cut out the pickles.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.988
Don't mean I can't run a precinct.

38:44.822 --> 38:45.948
Don't mean I can't walk a beat.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.993
Don't mean I can't clear more cases
than any two men half my age.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.995
I agree with most of that, Stan.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.623
I felt young again yesterday on patrol.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.086
Outside on the street,
wind in my face, all that crap.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.131
Then boom.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.634
There's always
the old equalizer, isn't there?

39:05.718 --> 39:06.927
Maybe.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.764
But you'll always
have a job in my squad room.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.101
I guess maybe I'll rejoin the "Y."

39:15.519 --> 39:17.271
Buy myself some purple underwear.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.814
Take it easy, Stan.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.109
This is a young man's soul
inside an old man's body.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.821
That stinks. You know that?

39:26.947 --> 39:28.199
That stinks.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.788
-Yeah, he shot him.
-Were you shooting to kill, Officer?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.874
No, ma'am, I was not,
but you have to understand

39:36.957 --> 39:40.586
that, uh, a man's life was at stake
under the circumstances.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.172
Is it true that the bear
is over 17 years old?

39:43.255 --> 39:44.840
I don't know anything about that.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.802
That it is, in fact,
a retired circus performer?

39:47.885 --> 39:49.887
Well, now, that may be true.

39:49.970 --> 39:53.849
That even his trainer considers
him too old and infirm to be--

39:53.933 --> 39:55.184
Why don't you ask the guy

39:55.267 --> 39:57.436
whose arm he almost pulled
out of its socket

39:57.520 --> 39:59.063
or Lieutenant Howard Hunter,

39:59.146 --> 40:00.314
who he almost<i> squoze</i>
to death this morning...

40:00.398 --> 40:02.858
-Suffocated.
-...when he was down at the station?

40:03.359 --> 40:06.737
How do you feel a police officer shooting
the law-enforcement symbol?

40:06.821 --> 40:08.239
I feel fine.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.241
Well, why didn't you fire a warning shot?

40:10.324 --> 40:13.619
Lady, I don't know if you know anything
about bears,

40:13.702 --> 40:15.913
but they are so big and mean and ugly

40:15.996 --> 40:18.624
that a warning shot
don't mean squat to 'em.

40:18.874 --> 40:23.170
-(chatter)
-Here comes the doctor.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.340
I have a statement.
After 40 minutes of surgery,

40:26.424 --> 40:31.554
we have successfully removed the bullet
from the upper bicep of Officer McBear.

40:31.804 --> 40:32.721
He's now in post-op.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.307
His condition is satisfactory and stable,

40:35.391 --> 40:37.518
and a full recovery is expected.

40:38.018 --> 40:40.104
I'll be glad to answer
any questions that you have.

40:40.479 --> 40:44.191
(in German accent) Yes, but will
he ever play the violin again?

40:50.072 --> 40:51.991
Frank, telephone, line six.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.536
Yeah.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.958
No, don't touch anything.
I'll be right down.

41:01.792 --> 41:02.710
Ray...

41:03.794 --> 41:05.296
See if you can raise Briscoe.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.257
They just found
Keenan's body in a dumpster.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.435
Deputy Chief Briscoe, please.
Ray Calletano speaking.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.690
Assume they move Scapezzi
and fill in Keenan's spot.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.653
Looks like you're<i> numero uno</i>
on the list,<i> compadre.</i>

41:32.531 --> 41:34.325
(siren wailing)

41:47.505 --> 41:49.632
No struggle.
It must have been somebody he knew.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.967
(siren wailing)

41:57.056 --> 41:58.474
Somebody talked, Warren.

41:58.891 --> 42:02.269
From the time Dugan gave us Keenan,
somebody heard and somebody acted.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.773
-Is that an accusation, Captain?
-It's an observation.

42:07.483 --> 42:11.403
Ozzy, Fletcher... Heh?

42:12.738 --> 42:15.199
Imagine, in one breath,
this slug is telling me

42:15.282 --> 42:16.867
she left me a million bucks.

42:17.493 --> 42:21.163
The next breath, he's got his filthy mitts
into it for 280 grand.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.540
That's still a lot of loot.

42:22.623 --> 42:25.709
Which is exactly the last thing
I want to be dealing with right now.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.003
I mean, she writes this...

42:29.338 --> 42:33.008
This hand-scribbled codicil.
You think that's not gonna be challenged?

42:33.592 --> 42:36.845
All of a sudden, I'm looking at hearings,
lawyers, all this stuff.

42:37.471 --> 42:40.975
She loved you, Henry, and she just wanted
to share what she had with you.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.893
Why should that make you
feel anything but happy?

42:42.977 --> 42:44.186
Because...

42:46.730 --> 42:48.023
Because I haven't grieved.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.319
I mean, first it was
the murder investigation.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.990
I wouldn't let myself
feel anything but my rage.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.618
And then I had to be executor
of her estate. Now this.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.914
When do I get a chance
to go off and just have grief?

43:04.540 --> 43:05.624
You're having it.

43:06.625 --> 43:09.962
But you're also having this.
I mean, it's called life.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.422
It just keeps coming at you.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.007
Just got to grab it.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.384
I think it's the best tribute
you could give her.

43:16.510 --> 43:17.595
I know, Fay.

43:18.971 --> 43:21.765
The woman brought light into my life.
I'm not gonna go back in the shadows.

43:24.310 --> 43:27.938
I'm sick of talking about the trials
and tribulations of Henry Goldblume.

43:28.355 --> 43:31.066
What about you? Still seeing Harry?

43:33.694 --> 43:35.529
I guess I embarrassed myself a little.

43:36.405 --> 43:38.907
I, um... I asked him out.

43:39.325 --> 43:42.369
Then I seduced him,
and then I basically told him to buzz off.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.622
You got a right.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.043
One-night stands really aren't my style.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.086
Doing it once doesn't mean they are.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.424
To you, Henry G.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.969
To the future and to your happiness.

44:01.513 --> 44:02.556
Thank you, Fay.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.434
Through everything,
you've been a friend and more.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.020
That door swings both ways, mister.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.998
You haven't said ten words
since we sat down to dinner.

44:32.961 --> 44:33.921
I drank.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.590
How many words is that?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.983
-When?
-Last week.

44:55.067 --> 44:55.984
Why?

45:00.155 --> 45:01.031
I'm not sure.

45:03.033 --> 45:08.580
-Is it me? Us?
-No, no, no, no. Not that.

45:14.086 --> 45:17.297
I think it started
with the Chief's encounter session.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.969
Briscoe calling me St. Francis--

45:24.012 --> 45:26.098
implying that I was just
as hooked on AA meetings

45:26.181 --> 45:27.349
as I had been on the bottle.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.519
I think I started asking myself

45:30.602 --> 45:33.397
if I hadn't traded
in one crutch for another.

45:36.984 --> 45:39.987
So I had a drink.
Just the one, then I stopped.

45:42.698 --> 45:43.991
The next day, one more.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.994
Two days later, one more.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.370
I was fine.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.330
Fine...

45:53.542 --> 45:54.835
I couldn't even let myself see

45:54.918 --> 45:57.337
that the only difference between me
and a normal drinker

45:57.421 --> 46:00.966
is that I was taking my one drink

46:01.049 --> 46:03.427
out of a pint bottle hidden
in the glove compartment.

46:06.972 --> 46:10.976
Then this urinalysis business
picked up the alcohol content in my blood.

46:12.269 --> 46:15.230
And Briscoe, God bless him,

46:15.314 --> 46:17.858
he did the right thing
for all the wrong reasons.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.861
Tried to blackmail me.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.824
But it reminded me...

46:27.826 --> 46:29.369
of how far I'd gone.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.332
One drink or 20, I'm a drunk.

46:34.875 --> 46:35.876
Always will be.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.506
How can I help? What can I do?

46:41.215 --> 46:43.175
By doing what you do every day.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.802
What about AA?

46:45.427 --> 46:48.180
Yeah, well, I missed a lot of meetings.
I got to get back.

46:49.097 --> 46:50.390
-When?
-Soon.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.767
Soon isn't soon enough.

46:51.850 --> 46:55.312
-Joyce--
-Frank, I love you.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.898
I know you know this,
but you don't have time.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.275
We're talking about life and death here.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.122
I used to say, "I'll just drink today,

47:15.290 --> 47:17.334
"and then I'll stay sober for 20 years.

47:18.752 --> 47:19.962
"I'll just drink today,

47:20.671 --> 47:22.631
and I'll be sober
for the rest of my life."

47:23.841 --> 47:28.178
But now I say, "Dear God,
please help me be sober today.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.973
And I'll ask for tomorrow, tomorrow."

47:37.688 --> 47:38.814
Thanks, Jim.

47:40.148 --> 47:41.024
Frank?

47:47.698 --> 47:50.409
Hi, I'm Frank. I'm an alcoholic.

47:50.492 --> 47:51.577
ALL: Hi, Frank.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.999
I've been sober two days.

47:57.499 --> 48:00.002
(applause)

48:03.505 --> 48:05.716
(closing theme playing)
