WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:26.693
<i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:31.740
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:38.914
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:38.997 --> 00:43.919
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

00:44.002 --> 00:48.048
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:51.843
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

00:51.927 --> 00:54.763
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

00:54.846 --> 00:58.016
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:03.355
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:08.902
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

01:09.528 --> 01:12.155
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:15.909
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:17.244
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.080
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:22.666
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:27.754
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:30.090
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

01:30.173 --> 01:32.676
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:46.315 --> 01:51.236
KURO, PLEASE...

01:54.489 --> 01:56.491
Rubber... bullets?

01:56.575 --> 01:59.745
It may be field training,
but we can't exactly use real bullets.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.372
If we die, that's the end of us.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.958
It'll still hurt pretty badly
if you get hit.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.002
Don't worry, I'm used to pain.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.299
Each team will be made up of three people.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.426
Nagai is the point man for Team Alpha.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
I'll give commands as the second.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.972
Manabe will be the tail. Nakano is...?

02:20.223 --> 02:22.851
<i>For those of you just joining us,</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:26.938
<i>Ryoichi Tadokoro and Kosaku Endo of</i>
<i>Matsunami Chemicals were murdered earlier.</i>

02:27.022 --> 02:29.608
What, are you still worried
about the other targets?

02:29.691 --> 02:30.776
So, what?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.111
<i>This continuing series of lapses</i>
<i>by the police</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:36.198
<i>has led to calls for reassessment</i>
<i>of their security measures.</i>

02:36.281 --> 02:37.157
Damn it...

02:39.326 --> 02:42.329
Don't get all wrapped up
in a sense of justice.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.247
Our focus here is very clear.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.585
Mr. Tozaki keeps tabs on the minister's
movements, and we ambush Sato, right?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.963
Seems like you do understand.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.426
Anyway, where's Ms. Izumi?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.388
If we're training, I wanna be on her team.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.807
She's at the lab with Mr. Tosaki.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.060
Apparently he's been summoned
by some American officials.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.979
So, about Dr. Ogura...

03:08.063 --> 03:10.190
I only ever met him in the monitor room.

03:10.816 --> 03:14.027
He left as soon as he heard
about Kei Nagai's escape.

03:14.111 --> 03:18.615
After that, you claim that the professor
went outside of the barricade,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.200
despite the ongoing attack,

03:20.283 --> 03:24.287
and that he was then killed by someone
on his way to the car.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.249
I'm not fully aware
of the exact details,

03:27.666 --> 03:30.377
but I heard that an IBM was used
in the attack.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.671
That's what the report we received said.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.841
And the corpse's dental records
are a match.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.469
However, there are several points
we have questions about.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.512
Such as?

03:40.595 --> 03:41.763
Such as...

03:42.180 --> 03:46.101
Why has the security camera footage
from the time of the attack disappeared?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.978
Yes, that is suspicious...

03:48.061 --> 03:52.023
It may have been caused by the explosion
Sato set off in the attack.

03:58.113 --> 04:01.616
It's also odd that the bodies
of the professor and his bodyguard

04:01.700 --> 04:03.994
were found in different places.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.997
It's possible they got separated
as they fled.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.039
And also...

04:08.290 --> 04:12.961
I've heard that a researcher who was
supposedly there that day is missing.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.921
That, I haven't heard about.

04:15.547 --> 04:19.718
I believe there isn't anything
corroborating that on our staff list.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.390
And finally, after Dr. Ogura
left the monitor room,

04:25.807 --> 04:28.477
you went outside the barricade as well,
didn't you?

04:29.936 --> 04:33.023
Could you possibly be
suspecting me?

04:33.398 --> 04:34.858
Hypothetically...

04:35.525 --> 04:39.613
if the professor was killed
not by Sato, as we suspect,

04:39.696 --> 04:43.074
there's only one person within
the facility that could have done it,

04:43.533 --> 04:46.161
and, Mr. Tosaki, that would be you.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.706
What reason would I have
to do something like that?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.543
All I know is...

04:53.960 --> 04:56.588
that despite the ongoing Ajin attack,

04:57.088 --> 05:01.301
you were unaccounted for
for nearly an hour, outside the facility.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.888
Why would you do something so risky?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.684
The truth is...

05:12.354 --> 05:16.399
my boss heard about Nagai's escape
and he laid into me over the phone.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.277
I felt I had to do something.

05:20.946 --> 05:24.491
I'm sure you understand...
the stress of a government job.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.208
<i>The circumstantial evidence</i>
<i>is extremely weak.</i>

05:33.583 --> 05:37.420
<i>Maybe that man really wasn't involved</i>
<i>in the professor's death...</i>

05:38.672 --> 05:40.257
I didn't ask for your opinion.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.676
I-- I'm sorry...

05:49.307 --> 05:51.351
This was a waste of time.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.773
Let's get their personal items
and go home. Put in the request.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.240
<i>Breaking news! Shortly after noon,</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:09.452
<i>an explosion occurred</i>
<i>inside the headquarters of Toyo Railroad.</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:12.372
<i>The reports are that</i>
<i>Toyo chairman Yutani,</i>

06:12.455 --> 06:15.250
<i>along with three others</i>
<i>are confirmed dead.</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:20.755
<i>The four victims</i>
<i>were all on the Ajin Sato's list,</i>

06:20.839 --> 06:23.842
<i>and some are saying that this may be</i>
<i>retribution by Sato</i>

06:23.925 --> 06:26.011
<i>for the government's hard-lined stance.</i>

06:26.803 --> 06:31.141
<i>Large protests are continuing in</i>
<i>response to Sato's repeated attacks.</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:35.103
Hey, did you see the news about the Ajin?

06:35.186 --> 06:37.355
Yeah, it's really scary...

06:37.731 --> 06:39.149
That one patient...

06:39.524 --> 06:41.610
Her brother is Kei Nagai.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.404
He was the Ajin on the news
a while ago, right?

06:44.487 --> 06:48.408
The one who threw someone off the roof
and escaped from the government facility.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.452
I can't help but worry...

06:57.000 --> 07:00.295
It's become a tough world
for Ajin to live in.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.672
Just like smokers.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.010
Once we stop Sato,
we can go back to our old lives.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.640
Unlike those cigarettes,
Ajin aren't harmful.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.185
Let's just hope so.

07:30.575 --> 07:35.538
A secret weapon. I've always wanted
to build something like this.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.629
<i>We will never give in</i>
<i>to such terrorism,</i>

07:42.712 --> 07:47.008
<i>and new legislation is needed</i>
<i>in order to protect our citizens</i>

07:47.092 --> 07:49.844
<i>and eliminate this Ajin organization</i>
<i>that threatens us.</i>

07:50.679 --> 07:53.306
This is really turning into a big deal.

07:53.765 --> 07:57.268
Things just keep getting worse
for us Ajin.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.522
You got a problem?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.065
Of course not.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.360
But, I wonder if we're going about it
right.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.239
Okay... What other way is there?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.199
Well...

08:12.617 --> 08:16.663
True, the heat
is getting turned up for us Ajin.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.708
But it's not all bad, you know.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.672
Ajin from all over Japan
have come to join us here.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.049
Some of them
came to the Ministry before,

08:28.133 --> 08:31.469
and there's even a group who are here
because they heard about you guys.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.264
The authorities can't do anything
about word of mouth.

08:35.390 --> 08:39.561
You see, they've all stood up
for the sake of Ajin and our future.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.647
There's no turning back now.

08:45.734 --> 08:50.572
Mr. Tanaka, I've got everyone helping
building the bombs.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.365
Oh, thanks.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.909
Is there anything else to do right now?

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
How about cleaning?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.957
Understood.
I'm working as the coordinator,

09:01.124 --> 09:02.834
so if you need anything, let me know.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.671
It's like our own little military!

09:06.963 --> 09:09.966
By the way, what's his name again?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.637
That's our Tanaka all right!

09:14.721 --> 09:16.389
What do you mean by that?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.808
Anyway, where's Mr. Sato?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.312
I haven't seen him for a while.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.023
Well, the answer is obvious...

09:27.484 --> 09:28.568
Understood.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.115
Kashiwagi of the Meihan Medical Center
has been killed.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.118
Apparently it happened
on a moving bullet train.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.334
Mr. Tosaki, you're up.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.961
The next target, the Minister,

09:47.045 --> 09:49.798
is holed up
in the Crisis Management Office.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.301
However, now that there have been
these multiple attacks,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.428
they're passing a new measure.

09:55.512 --> 09:59.599
He's been pressed for a response and will
be meeting with the Vice-Minister

09:59.682 --> 10:01.142
to get their stories straight.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.022
I've already checked out
where they're meeting.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.942
It's a facility used by VIPs.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.611
You said the attack would be
at the Ministry,

10:11.694 --> 10:14.072
his home, or his usual restaurant?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.616
I said those were nothing more

10:17.325 --> 10:18.326
Besides...

10:18.910 --> 10:23.123
Nagai, I'm sure that you
can adapt to a change or two.

10:26.084 --> 10:30.547
Well, a good plan should be
adaptable to changes.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.302
Hirasawa, get the building map and
figure out the formation.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.262
Yes, sir.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.806
I'll get a detailed schedule.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.267
As for the rest of you,
focus on your training.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.184
All right!

10:45.311 --> 10:46.938
Shimomura, let's go.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.148
Mr. Tosaki.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.736
From now on,
every second we've got counts.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.197
We can't afford any failures.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.036
Who do you think you're talking to?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.005
Excuse me.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.717
Not only are you unable to catch Sato,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.344
you're letting our sponsors get
annihilated.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.640
Very brave of you to come here
and show your face like this...

11:22.724 --> 11:24.142
My apologies.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.020
But I want to make sure
nothing happens to you, Minister.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.480
This place is like a nuclear bomb shelter.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.400
Even the Ajin can't get me here.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.401
But, sir...

11:33.818 --> 11:36.362
if you go outside,
it's a different story.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.324
-Just in case, you--
-Don't make me laugh.

11:39.407 --> 11:43.995
Why should I bother with an incompetent
lackey who's about to be cut loose anyway?

11:45.955 --> 11:49.834
And you hardly have time
to be worrying about others.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.837
According to Sokabe,
those two people from the Pentagon

11:52.921 --> 11:55.757
have launched an investigation on you,
haven't they?

11:56.174 --> 11:58.259
I've already finished
my interview with them,

11:58.676 --> 12:02.055
and I haven't given them anything
that they should doubt me.

12:04.682 --> 12:09.479
With the police's permission, Dr. Ogura's
personal items have been moved in here.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.400
I've already given you the list
from when they were moved.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.945
Please give us some time to check.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.921
There's no problem.
Everything on the list is here--

12:35.004 --> 12:38.216
I see your observation skills
are still nonexistent.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.099
Just as I thought.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.186
There's something that should be here,
but oddly enough, it's not.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.986
What happens now? How can you get the
schedule like this?

12:58.069 --> 13:01.948
Don't worry about it.
If the minister won't give it up,

13:02.031 --> 13:04.325
we'll just target someone
close to him.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.120
I've just sent you your schedule, sir.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.040
Yes, I'm still at the Ajin lab.
When I've finished--

13:11.124 --> 13:14.585
<i>The Minister's private secretary</i>
<i>is examining materials for the new law.</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:17.672
<i>I'm also supposed to give her a report.</i>

13:21.134 --> 13:23.803
That's when we'll grab the schedule.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.014
What--?

13:26.097 --> 13:30.059
It takes about 10 seconds to automatically
recognize and move data.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.646
-Don't get noticed during that time.
-You mean...

13:33.730 --> 13:36.649
This is a job for you, and your IBM.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.324
Sorry, but can't this wait?

13:45.408 --> 13:49.203
I'm sorry, but Mr. Tosaki's in a hurry
and needs you to check it.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.251
Thanks to these Ajins
there's so much stupid work to do.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.547
You could've just e-mailed it...

14:00.965 --> 14:03.092
<i>Kuro, please...</i>

14:09.140 --> 14:10.266
Sure, I guess it's fine.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.935
I'll pass it on to the minister.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.148
What is it?

14:17.231 --> 14:20.234
No, it's just...

14:24.906 --> 14:29.619
Th-- That watch. It's really nice.
It looks good on you.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.876
Oh, so you've noticed!
Actually, this is a one-of-a-kind antique.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.320
And this suit may be minimal,
but it's a top-quality brand.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.241
And the heels are haute couture,
so they cost quite a bundle.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.827
That's really impressive.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.997
If you'd like, I can tell you the shop.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.500
Th-- Thank you so much.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.169
Maybe another time.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.338
Wait a second.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.553
Are you and Mr. Tosaki an item?

15:29.387 --> 15:33.975
You're always together,
and you do anything he says, right?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.061
I-- I'm just doing my job and I...

15:37.145 --> 15:40.148
Just being honest,
you need better taste.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.381
<i>Use the ghost as a shield,</i>
<i>shoot from behind it...</i>

16:13.556 --> 16:16.058
<i>The main goal of the plan</i>
<i>is to capture Sato...</i>

16:16.142 --> 16:18.060
<i>Once he's found,</i>
<i>try to neutralize him.</i>

16:18.144 --> 16:19.061
Idiot!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.189
Don't underestimate my reflexes!

16:21.272 --> 16:22.273
That was on purpose.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.405
Wh-- Why do I have to be...
Sato anyway...?!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.534
That's a new record.

16:36.162 --> 16:40.625
Now we just wait for word
from Mr. Tosaki.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.345
MEETING WITH VICE-MINISTER

16:52.428 --> 16:54.555
<i>That's tonight...!</i>

17:01.938 --> 17:05.066
Damn it, what is Shimomura up to?!

17:13.824 --> 17:17.870
What do you want?
I thought our interview was over already.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.749
Actually there's one thing
that I forgot to ask you about.

17:22.291 --> 17:26.003
There was one thing that should have been
among Dr. Ogura's items,

17:26.087 --> 17:27.421
but I couldn't find it.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.714
His items?

17:28.798 --> 17:33.386
That's right. I guess someone
must have taken them out of storage.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.306
You see, these would have been left
in Dr. Ogura's car.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.849
His cigarettes.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.436
You know about them?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.855
I don't know what you're talking about,

17:45.064 --> 17:48.484
but if you want to question me,
you'll have to go through proper channels.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.990
Of course, that's more than reasonable.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.243
Now I'm busy, so if you'll excuse me...

18:05.167 --> 18:09.088
Sorry, but I'm sick
of all this Japanese red tape.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.215
I'll get you to talk soon enough.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.384
Bring the car around.

18:14.844 --> 18:19.140
Is this really all right? Doing this
to a Japanese government official...

18:19.223 --> 18:22.310
I believe I said
I didn't ask for your opinion?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.564
If it comes down to it,
we'll have him meet with an accident.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.276
People around here don't look that closely
when there's a death.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.497
That's the woman who's always with him...

18:43.581 --> 18:45.708
It's too late. Restrain her.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.712
Out of my way!

18:54.425 --> 18:56.010
-She's...!
-This woman...!

18:56.844 --> 18:58.346
This woman's an Ajin!

19:08.689 --> 19:10.775
<i>I've already used him too much.</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:30.544
Your internal organs are ruptured,
so you won't last more than a few minutes.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.634
Once the mental link is severed,

19:36.717 --> 19:39.637
an IBM is nothing but a doll.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.306
Not even good as a creepy decoration.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.066
So, he was secretly keeping
a pet Ajin too...

19:52.441 --> 19:54.944
Now we've got another good test subject.

19:55.653 --> 20:00.658
<i>I'm sorry. You'd have been better off</i>
<i>if you could just die.</i>

20:26.392 --> 20:29.353
Forget it! We'd be in more trouble
if we got seen.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.708
Our priority now is getting him to talk.
Start the car.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.258
Don't worry.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.302
What I would have used on her...

21:02.219 --> 21:04.221
I'll use on you later instead.

21:04.305 --> 21:08.476
After all, you have to take responsibility
for your mistakes...

21:30.664 --> 21:32.333
<i>What is your job?</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:34.543
<i>My job is...</i>

21:35.252 --> 21:36.754
<i>It's to protect you.</i>

21:47.640 --> 21:50.059
TO BE CONTINUED

21:51.227 --> 21:54.271
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

21:54.355 --> 21:57.608
<i>I'll trade it</i>

21:57.691 --> 22:02.863
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:04.031 --> 22:10.329
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:16.001
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

22:16.752 --> 22:20.881
<i>You can see them all</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:27.596
<i>When you come to my house</i>

22:27.680 --> 22:33.727
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

22:33.811 --> 22:35.938
<i>While the wind blows</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:40.276
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

22:42.403 --> 22:48.659
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

22:48.742 --> 22:55.040
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

22:55.124 --> 23:01.005
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:01.589 --> 23:04.300
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:04.383 --> 23:11.181
<i>Always"</i>
