While at a job in the historic
gold city of Timmins...

00:15.233 --> 00:17.200
- Oh my God, that's gorgeous!

00:17.333 --> 00:19.333
Narrator: Ted and his team
discover one of their biggest

00:19.467 --> 00:22.867
salvage finds to date -
a mint 1930s art deco bar.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.967
- If you had to buy
something like this new

00:25.100 --> 00:27.000
and get it made,
you'd be $100,000 bucks.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.133
We have to get this outta here,
okay?

00:29.266 --> 00:30.867
Kevin: Thousands of miners go
through there.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.934
And if they had some gold,
what they would do

00:33.066 --> 00:34.934
is stash a little bit
of it away.

00:35.066 --> 00:36.734
Narrator: Inspired by many
local legends...

00:36.867 --> 00:39.133
Ted: Selling stolen gold
highgrade.

00:39.266 --> 00:40.600
There's gotta be highgrade
in there,

00:40.734 --> 00:42.533
these guys were all involved
in it.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.133
Narrator: Ted was determined
to find gold.

00:45.266 --> 00:47.233
(Ceiling panels clatter)

00:48.333 --> 00:50.633
Ted: It's getting serious now,
man.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.767
Holy (bleep), man,
look at that.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.367
I think that's gold.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.734
(Machine rumbles,
concrete crumbles)

00:56.867 --> 00:58.667
Man: Boom!

00:58.800 --> 01:00.700
Ted: My name's Ted
and I'm the head of salvage

01:00.834 --> 01:02.600
for Priestly Demolition.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.600
Before the machines move in
to wreck,

01:04.734 --> 01:06.467
my team's job is to get in
the building

01:06.600 --> 01:08.800
and remove anything of value.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.467
- That's gorgeous!
Look at that.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.000
- Pretty cool, eh?
- Whoa.

01:12.133 --> 01:14.800
Ted: But our job is not done
until we get these items

01:14.934 --> 01:16.667
back to the yard
and find a buyer.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.567
- Deal.
- Sold.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.066
Justin: That is nice.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.533
Ted: There will be a lot
of big challenges this year.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.934
Did it go right through?

01:23.066 --> 01:25.233
But this is why I get up
in the morning.

01:25.367 --> 01:26.800

01:26.934 --> 01:28.467
Justin: Oh, that feels kinda
good.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.934
Ted: We are the

Brandon: They're just
white rocks.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.166

See that?

01:48.300 --> 01:51.266
I'm sure that is.
It's right in the middle.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.934
- Whoa, wait, hold on,
let me see that.

01:53.066 --> 01:54.834
- Maybe.
- No, let me see it,

01:54.967 --> 01:56.400
I wanna see it.
- Look at it, man.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.700
See how the gold is
in the middle?

01:58.834 --> 02:01.100
- No way we actually
found gold in here.

02:01.233 --> 02:03.567
- Real gold.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.533
How cool is that?

02:07.033 --> 02:08.333
Narrator: Built in the 1920s,

02:08.467 --> 02:10.266
the Grandview Hotel
was one of dozens

02:10.400 --> 02:12.600
of local drinking
establishments in the area.

02:12.734 --> 02:14.433
Aside from hardworking miners,

02:14.567 --> 02:17.800
gold smugglers and bootleggers
also passed through this bar.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.066
The Grandview almost made it
to 100,

02:20.200 --> 02:22.800
but fire closed its doors
in 2018.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.667

bring this back to Justin,

02:25.800 --> 02:26.900
show him what we found or what?

02:27.033 --> 02:28.900
- That one's very visible.
That one.

02:29.033 --> 02:30.467
- Did you hear a word
I just said?

02:30.600 --> 02:33.000
- Pardon?
- (Laughs) What're we doing?

02:33.133 --> 02:35.900
Are we gonna keep looking
or are we gonna go?

02:36.033 --> 02:37.700
- I'm gonna go tell Justin.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.800
Justin: Everything's good.
No, it's perfect.

02:41.934 --> 02:44.867
Oh. Ted's here. Here, I'll go.
- Who's that?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.467
- Just checking in
on the home front.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.000
Miss the little ones, you know?
- Ah, you know,

02:48.133 --> 02:49.967
it's life on the road.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.300
- Well then, maybe this'll
make you happy.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.800
- Ahh! That's gold!
- Found it up in the ceiling.

02:54.934 --> 02:56.333
- You found gold.
- Everybody said,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.000
you gotta look
for the highgrade.

02:58.133 --> 03:00.934
- That's cool.
- I'm going back in.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.333
- I know you are.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.867
- I'll see you in a bit.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
- Ah... aghhh! Real gold.

03:08.066 --> 03:09.667
Narrator: Ted heads back
into the basement,

03:09.800 --> 03:11.200
hoping for more gold,

03:11.333 --> 03:13.333
while continuing to search
for salvage.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.600
- Water all got down here,
runs to the basement,

03:15.734 --> 03:18.133
everything's rotten.
There, it's horrible.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.700
Basement - heavy water damage
down there,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.200
flooded out big time.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.166
No furniture's gonna make it
through that.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.066
That's odd.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.734
There's a lot of bras
in this place too.

03:31.767 --> 03:34.066
Narrator: Upstairs, Justin
and Brandon have to come up

03:34.200 --> 03:36.367
with a plan to take
the bar apart.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.367
- The outer shell
is the bar we want,

03:38.500 --> 03:40.734
so I think I wanna focus
on this piece.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.300
I think it's anchored
to this little wall here.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.734
So if you take the top off,
and then start figuring out

03:45.867 --> 03:47.700
how this top is embedded
into that,

03:47.834 --> 03:49.200
and then we'll go from there.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.700
This bar is an opportunity
for me to redeem myself

03:51.834 --> 03:53.467
from last year.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.934
(Loud crunch)
Well, it broke.

03:57.066 --> 03:59.066
- How the (bleep) did it break?
- It's glued down.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.266
- We don't pry the (bleep) top
of the bar off,

04:01.400 --> 04:04.800
you cut it into sections.
(Smash)

04:05.467 --> 04:07.000
Justin: So I'm a little...

04:07.133 --> 04:08.867
I'm scared to just hit things
now without looking.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.400
Did you get that off?

04:10.533 --> 04:12.367
I'm nervous.
We can't break this thing.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.133
We need to be more careful
on how we take this bar apart.

04:15.266 --> 04:17.133
Brandon: It doesn't look like
it's attached to the wall.

04:17.266 --> 04:18.900
- It's gotta be attached.

04:19.033 --> 04:21.033
Try to separate these
two surfaces.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.900
(Whack)
Do you see where it's moving?

04:24.033 --> 04:25.433
'Kay, use the bar.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.633
Just slowly, slowly.
Do you see how it is?

04:27.767 --> 04:29.767
- I think it's the one nail
that you said

04:29.900 --> 04:32.400
that it didn't matter.
- Well, that's my fault.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.700
We'll just keep going at it,
we'll figure it out.

Ted: Hey, that's a cool sign.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.600

to a bit of trouble

04:50.734 --> 04:52.533
to make a 'Beware of Dog' sign.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.567
Salvaging through old buildings
is very exciting.

digging through,
looking for the right piece.

Feels cooler.

Oh, look at the meat hooks
in here.

Not even chipped.

Over 30 years, I've been
involved in this business.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.433
I dream of finding stuff

05:28.600 --> 05:31.200
These old thermometers

a bidding war.

it is still mint.

06:25.066 --> 06:27.567
I would gut this because
it's gonna be very heavy.

For the 15, 20 minutes it's
gonna take to cut that out,

06:30.200 --> 06:32.033
it's gonna save a lot
of lifting.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.400
You'll figure it out.

I don't care how much work
it takes to get the bar back

cutting this up.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.166

demolish the building.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.000

A lot.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.100
My grandfather, he was here
his entire life,

07:17.233 --> 07:18.433

07:18.567 --> 07:20.600
He, you know,
worked the railroad

07:20.734 --> 07:23.000
and when he came home,
he'd stop in and have a drink.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.133
And he had a stool that sat
at the end of the bar,

07:26.266 --> 07:27.767

07:27.900 --> 07:30.100
Even if it was packed
and he wasn't here,

08:58.433 --> 09:00.867
they have to build a ramp
to hold its weight.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.567
- You think this is enough
bracing?

09:02.700 --> 09:04.467
- No, but we have no time.
You guys finish that.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.567
I'll hook up the winch.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.500
(Cable buzzes as it unwinds)
So grab the bar

09:10.633 --> 09:12.867

- Okay.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.667
'Kay, it's starting to pull.
Are you ready?

09:15.867 --> 09:17.333
Narrator: With the ramp
in place,

09:17.467 --> 09:19.700
Justin winches the first
600-pound segment

09:19.834 --> 09:21.467
out of the building.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.567
- Are the wheels on the ramp?
- Almost.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.367
Ted: This bar could be worth
$15 grand after I restore it.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.266
But if it gets damaged,

09:32.400 --> 09:34.700
the price is going down
heavily.

09:38.266 --> 09:39.533
Make sure you hold it.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.767
(Metallic clanking)

09:41.900 --> 09:43.333
- 'Kay, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.200
- Whoa!

10:04.133 --> 10:05.867
- That's it for the winch.
- The battery's dead?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.934
Disconnect it

off its value

10:15.533 --> 10:17.100

10:17.233 --> 10:19.133
Ted: This bar is in excellent
condition.

10:19.266 --> 10:20.667

in stainless.

properly.

26:30.367 --> 26:33.233
- That's a very rare square
piano, a Kimball.

26:33.367 --> 26:35.900
- Oh my God. Look at it.
- (Chuckles)

26:36.934 --> 26:38.600
- I've never seen one like that.

26:38.734 --> 26:40.867
That thing is unbelievable.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.800
For a period of time
in the late 1800s,

26:42.934 --> 26:45.734
square grand pianos
were quite the fashion.

26:45.867 --> 26:47.834
They're very rare.

26:47.967 --> 26:51.600
Fully restored,
they're worth $25 to $30,000.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.500
(Piano music plays)

26:53.633 --> 26:55.934
Narrator: Based in Chicago,
the Kimball Piano Company

26:56.066 --> 26:58.066
was one of the most popular
square piano manufacturers

26:58.200 --> 26:59.734
in the world.

26:59.867 --> 27:02.233
During its heyday
in the late 19th century,

27:02.367 --> 27:05.400
the square piano outsold
the Grand Piano nine to one,

27:05.533 --> 27:08.867
with some American models
selling for up to $800

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
or the cost of a small home
at the time.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.100
The manufacturing
of square pianos

27:13.233 --> 27:15.000
ceased in early 20th century,

27:15.133 --> 27:17.533
making them rare
and hard to find.

27:19.867 --> 27:21.567
- Oh, I didn't know
you could play.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.300
- I can't. (Plays random notes)
(Laughs)

27:23.433 --> 27:25.000
- How much do you think
that weighs?

27:25.133 --> 27:26.900
- I have no idea.
I'm guessing--

27:27.033 --> 27:29.900
- Oh God, it weighs a lot.
- More than what Ted can lift.

27:30.033 --> 27:31.734
How're we getting it out?
- We're getting it out,

27:31.867 --> 27:34.467
we got Justin. Isn't that cool?
- Look how heavy it is,

27:34.600 --> 27:37.100
look how wide it is.
This piano is gonna take

27:37.233 --> 27:39.567
a few minutes to figure out,
for sure.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.934
People give away pianos
because moving them

27:42.066 --> 27:43.667
costs so much money.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.934
If you move them incorrectly,
they break.

27:46.066 --> 27:48.567
I'd never done it before,
so how're you gonna do it?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.533
- I gotta go back to the oil
field. Have fun.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.667
- Oil field, that's cool.
- Such a weird thing to say.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.567
- Look at all this stuff!

27:54.700 --> 27:56.266
Narrator: While Justin figures
out

27:56.400 --> 27:57.767

27:57.900 --> 27:59.900
Ted explores the rest
of the house for salvage.

28:00.100 --> 28:03.133
- This is cool.
This is a 1950s shirt press.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.467
It is in wicked good condition.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.400
I can get $400 for this easy.

28:07.533 --> 28:10.867
This lamp is just a colonial
reproduction, made in the '50s.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.734
Late 1800s spinning wheel.

28:13.867 --> 28:17.300
There's a nice early 1900s
settee

28:17.433 --> 28:18.934
with a matching chair.

28:19.066 --> 28:21.734
Those are odd fellows chairs.
Those odd fellow chairs,

28:21.867 --> 28:24.533
I know a dominatrix
looking for some.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.367
Doesn't matter how odd
the piece is,

28:26.500 --> 28:28.333
I got buyers for everything.

28:28.467 --> 28:31.333
- How do you even get that out?
- I'll get it out. You watch.

28:31.467 --> 28:33.400
- There's a lot of stuff
in this house.

28:33.533 --> 28:35.133
- We'll get all the small
stuff out.

28:35.266 --> 28:37.300
- Piano, we'll save for last.
- All right?

28:37.433 --> 28:38.734
- Yeah.
- All right. Cool, let's go.

it's very cool, look at it.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.500

29:02.934 --> 29:04.467

to slide it?

29:09.934 --> 29:11.700
- Yeah. Okay, ready?
Just slide it.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.700
This piano is old
and it's very fragile,

29:13.834 --> 29:15.233
but it's worth a lot of money.

29:15.367 --> 29:17.266
We have to get it from
one side of the house

29:17.400 --> 29:19.000

29:25.834 --> 29:28.000
- We can't afford to break
this piano.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.100
It will not be worth that
$25 grand.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.400
No. That leg's gonna kick out.
I'm not moving this anymore.

29:32.533 --> 29:35.100
It's just too big to move
by hand.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.166

eight hundred pounds.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.867
I'm not moving this anymore.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.133
It's just too big to move
by hand.

29:46.266 --> 29:48.767
It's so heavy that if it falls
over with one leg gone,

29:48.900 --> 29:50.400
it could actually fall on me

29:50.533 --> 29:52.500
or we could break
the whole thing.

29:52.633 --> 29:54.400
Narrator: Ted thinks
the square piano

29:54.533 --> 29:56.300
could be worth up to $25,000.
- Ted?!

29:56.433 --> 29:58.133
Narrator: But first they need
to get it safely

29:58.266 --> 29:59.600
out of the house.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.066
- What're you doing,
trying to move it?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.667
- Yeah, we just don't know
how to do it.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.066
- Well, you gotta get it off
the legs.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.867
- I think we gotta build
a frame to support the belly

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
of the piano and then
put some wheels under it.

30:09.133 --> 30:11.767
Ted: The piano is big ticket
item and it is heavy.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.133
Justin's got a good idea.
Just make a frame

30:14.266 --> 30:16.934
so we can get it outta there.
- I'm hoping this'll work.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.600
- We gotta get it outta here
somehow

30:18.734 --> 30:20.767
and we are in a hurry
as always.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.967
- Hey, you got it, eh?

30:22.100 --> 30:23.667

the other side,

you might be interested in.

31:04.734 --> 31:06.066

maybe you'd be interested.

so this was built on site.

35:46.767 --> 35:49.200

cut the hole in the wall,

to the yard

37:48.533 --> 37:50.400
to check out the salvage
from Petrolia.

Ted: Hi Tammy, we got
a whole pile of stuff

37:52.533 --> 37:54.300

from Petrolia,

37:54.433 --> 37:55.700

37:55.834 --> 37:57.533
See anything that catches
your eye, just let me know.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.834
- When I first walked in,
I really noticed

37:59.967 --> 38:02.367
this incredible press iron.
- It's quite rare

38:02.500 --> 38:04.700
and it's in museum condition.

When I saw the 1950s press,
I immediately thought of Tammy.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.700
She's a part time pinup model
and she collects 50s pieces.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.333
Right up her alley.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.133
- To get one in this quality

38:18.266 --> 38:20.567
with all of the original papers
still intact.

38:20.700 --> 38:23.133
This was well loved
and well taken care of.

38:23.266 --> 38:24.600
- $129.50.

38:24.734 --> 38:26.367
- That was a lot of money
in the '50s.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.266
- Yeah.
- $129 would probably be

38:28.400 --> 38:30.700
close to, you know, maybe $800
or $900 in our time.

38:30.834 --> 38:32.533
What would you sell this for?
- $500 bucks.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.133
That's $500 bucks all day long.

38:34.266 --> 38:35.533
- It's a beautiful piece,

38:35.667 --> 38:38.467
um, would you go
a little bit lower?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.200
Maybe around $425?

38:42.233 --> 38:44.367
Because I drove
all the way out here.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.333
And you know what?
Okay, maybe $450?

38:48.500 --> 38:50.233
- $450?
- $425, around that range.

38:50.367 --> 38:53.333
- Well, I'll take the higher
part at $450. How's that?

38:53.467 --> 38:54.600
- It'll set me back
a little bit,

38:54.734 --> 38:56.800
but I'm definitely going
to have to do my own nails

38:56.934 --> 38:58.367

38:58.500 --> 39:00.300
- Same with me.
- But it is worth it.

39:00.433 --> 39:02.200
It's beautiful. I've never
seen one like it ever.

39:02.333 --> 39:03.800
The ironing board is like
screaming at me

39:03.934 --> 39:05.767
because it's totally 1950s.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.667
It's everything that
I live for.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.266
To own a piece like that,
that was actually used

39:10.400 --> 39:12.200
by somebody, I feel honoured.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.066
- What else?
- I really like that green lamp

39:14.200 --> 39:15.533
over there on the table.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.800
Yeah, it's like late farmhouse
style.

39:17.934 --> 39:19.767
That would look beautiful
on my dresser actually.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.333
- It would.
- What would you sell this for?

39:21.467 --> 39:23.767
- It is a reproduction,
so I don't know, $25 bucks?

39:23.900 --> 39:25.834
- Would you do $20?
- $20 bucks, sold. Sold.

39:25.967 --> 39:27.867
- You know what else I was
looking at when I came in

39:28.000 --> 39:30.100

That is incredible.

39:30.233 --> 39:31.867

- Well...

39:36.900 --> 39:38.533
What would you offer me
right now?

39:38.667 --> 39:42.133
- Maybe $175?
- Without that crack,

39:42.266 --> 39:43.967
it's a $350 piece.
- Wow.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.300

shop here now.

39:46.433 --> 39:47.800
I think I'd rather fix that.

39:47.934 --> 39:49.967
I don't wanna sell it for $175.
