00:08.275 --> 00:10.609
- You guys are clearly having
some serious issues.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.378
- No marriage is perfect.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.146
- I could tell your wife.
- I have no idea

00:14.148 --> 00:15.514
What you're talking about.
- How about ten grand

00:15.516 --> 00:17.349
To make sure
helen never finds out?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.084
- Can't help you out unless you
tell me what it's for.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.553
- It's money.
- Okay, how much?

00:21.555 --> 00:24.156
- Do you think he's anemic?
- No, the blood work was normal.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.758
It seems like it was
just a panic attack.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.160
- Helen, I can't
keep it from you.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.628
I had a fling this summer.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.531
- It is a destructive thing
for a waitress!

00:32.533 --> 00:34.666
- You just see me
as potential unfulfilled.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.702
- It was stuck
to the bottom of the pie box.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.537
- Can I see it?
- You're screwing around.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.805
- Cherry, please?
- After everything

00:39.807 --> 00:41.306
He's done for you.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.775
- You ever ask her
how she found out, huh?

00:42.777 --> 00:44.109
Who told her to call the cops?
- Let's go.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.511
- She saw you call the cops.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.146
- Cole, come on.
- No, she wasn't even there.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.381
You know who was there?
The guy she's fucking.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.517
[grunts]
- do I know him?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.118
- No.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.520
- It's your problem.
You deal with it.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.388
- Well, grandma's not
doing well at all.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.723
I could feel it.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.258
- Do you know a place
called "the end"?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.392
- No, what is it?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.561
- So you've never been?
- Never.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.063
- Let's make a baby.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.494
In <i>romeo and juliet?</i>

02:42.496 --> 02:46.899
Anybody?
Anyone?

02:46.901 --> 02:48.300
- The montagues and capulets?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.402
- Montague and capulet.
Okay, great.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.371
Why do they have to die?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.306
- Uh, it's in the script,
mr. Solloway.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.275
- I know it is, cherise,
but until the morning

02:56.277 --> 02:59.878
After their wedding,
<i>romeo and juliet</i> is a comedy

02:59.880 --> 03:01.914
In the classic sense
of the form.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.283
So why do you think shakespeare
chose to change it up?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.818
- 'cause he's soft.
[laughter]

03:06.820 --> 03:10.322
- Okay.
Anybody else?

03:10.324 --> 03:13.859
Keisha?

03:15.662 --> 03:18.697
- Maybe they're just too happy.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.466
- Okay, I'm interested.
Tell me more.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.703
- Well, like,
the shit's not their fault,

03:24.705 --> 03:27.940
He was all like,
"meet me 'hereth,'"

03:27.942 --> 03:30.409
And she's like,
"I'll be 'thereth,'"

03:30.411 --> 03:32.277
And then, like, her grandma--

03:32.279 --> 03:35.280
- Yeah, the nurse.
- Yeah, and that freaky dude--

03:35.282 --> 03:36.615
- The friar.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.283
- They the ones who fuck it up.

03:38.285 --> 03:41.853
[laughter]

03:41.855 --> 03:44.823
- Right.
Absolutely right.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.291
Why do they fuck it up?

03:46.293 --> 03:49.461
[laughter]
- wow.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.563
- 'cause they're old.
- They're old.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.633
Right, they're old,
like me, they're adults,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.768
And adults are imperfect.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.905
Romeo and juliet are children.
They're innocents.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.574
They never hurt anybody,
they never betrayed anybody,

04:02.576 --> 04:05.444
So because they're innocents,
their love is pure.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.346
But when the adults interfere,

04:07.348 --> 04:08.647
Even though they're
trying to help,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.582
Which both the nurse
and the friar are,

04:10.584 --> 04:14.653
They end up corrupting
this perfect love.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.757
What shakespeare's trying to say
is that pure love

04:18.759 --> 04:22.728
Cannot sustain
in an imperfect world.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.267
Okay, act iii, scene 4.

Hey.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.744
- Sorry.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.648
- That's okay.
They seated me.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.484
- Mr. Solloway.
- Hey, jed, how are you?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.618
- Good, teach.
Nice to see you again.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.820
- Good to see you.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.422
Wish he'd go to college.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.957
- I thought he was in a band.
- Yeah, he is.

- Are they any good?
- No, they're terrible.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.928

- Yeah?

a few celebrities in recently.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.679

or something.

- No, of course not.

Wow, what's that for?

05:43.944 --> 05:48.480
- I don't know.
Sticking it out?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.623

we can afford this.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.825
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I know

05:59.827 --> 06:01.560
We can't afford it.
- Helen.

I have plenty.

What are you in the mood for?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.730
- Hey.
- What's up?

06:38.732 --> 06:41.533
- You busy?
- Just doing homework.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.874
- That was my favorite book
when I was your age.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.642

You've told me many times.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.944

06:52.946 --> 06:56.415
So mom showed me
your report card.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.784
- Fantastic.

06:58.786 --> 07:03.021
- You want to tell me
what happened this semester?

07:03.023 --> 07:04.156
- It got harder.

07:06.759 --> 07:11.530
- Come on, you got a--
you got a b-minus in algebra.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.500
You used to do algebra for fun
two years ago.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.102
- I can't hear in class.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.671
It's too crowded.
Everyone's talking at once.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.675
- So...Move nearer
the front of the class.

All the girls sit up there.

okay, well...

07:31.518 --> 07:33.518
Why don't you go find mr. Reiner
after school,

07:33.520 --> 07:36.087
And ask him for some extra help?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.857
- Okay, sure.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.192
- Will you do that?

07:40.194 --> 07:42.194
- No.
- Why not?

07:42.196 --> 07:44.663
- Because I'll get the shit
kicked out of me, dad.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.565
If they find out
that I went in for extra help--

07:46.567 --> 07:47.999
- Who's "they?"

07:50.837 --> 07:53.538
- M-maybe I should just go
to private school next semester,

07:53.540 --> 07:56.541
With whitney.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.715
- Do you really want to do that?

08:03.717 --> 08:06.151
- I don't know.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.953
- I thought you wanted to go
to science and tech.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.688
Isn't that what you told me?
- Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.157
- So you changing your mind now?

08:15.695 --> 08:21.700
Look, I-I know it gets
a little tough, okay, but...

08:21.702 --> 08:24.769
You're getting
a real life education there,

Not some private school
fish bowl bullshit.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.244
Just give it one more semester,
okay?

If you still hate it
at the end of this year, then...

with your grandfather.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.756
- [retching]

09:17.758 --> 09:19.157
- Think about it.
Look at how thin she's gotten,

09:19.159 --> 09:20.759
And she barely eats anything.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.061
- Well, then what's she got
to throw up?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.163
- What should we do?
- Let's go in there

- No.

didn't I?

09:48.188 --> 09:51.856
- It wasn't your finest hour.
- Yeah.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.858
But we do need to nip it
in the bud.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.062
You have no idea how dangerous
eating disorders are,

09:57.064 --> 09:58.830
Trust me.
The longer she goes on,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.866
The harder it's gonna be
for her to stop.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.676
Is it my fault?

10:11.678 --> 10:16.014
Did I somehow...Make her think
she had to be thin?

10:16.016 --> 10:19.351
- No.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.087

with your fucking mother.

- Oh, don't call her that.

10:24.358 --> 10:27.258
- You're right, I'm sorry.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.395
- No, you're right, it probably
was my fucking mother.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.964
I hope she's happy paying
for whitney's fucking therapy,

10:32.966 --> 10:35.900
And I just found out she's
not even coming this weekend.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.103
- To the benefit?
- Mm-hmm, she's going to a spa

10:38.105 --> 10:40.739
With my aunt.
- Well, why do we have to go?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.841
- Because somebody
has to be there for my dad.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.644
It's a big deal, because it's
a lifetime achievement award,

10:45.646 --> 10:47.379
And now I'm afraid
to leave whitney, because she--

10:47.381 --> 10:49.180
- Don't you think
you may be overreacting?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.716
- No, I don't think
I'm overreacting, I don't!

10:51.718 --> 10:54.052
And you have lost the right
to say that to me.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.737
You know,
we used to be a team.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.008
- We still are.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.812
- No, now we're just two idiots

That don't know how
to handle anything.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.296
I don't know what to do,
because my daughter needs me.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.432
And I feel like I have to talk
to her about what's going on,

11:40.434 --> 11:42.701

Or famous or rich,
but I didn't care about that,

13:50.564 --> 13:52.230
Because I had
a rich, famous father

13:52.232 --> 13:53.898
And he was
such a fucking asshole,

13:53.900 --> 13:58.303
And you adored me.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.438

You wouldn't leave,
and you would be a good father,

14:02.576 --> 14:05.310

14:05.312 --> 14:07.312
And we would grow old
and die together,

14:07.314 --> 14:09.180
And everyone would
talk about how lucky we are,

28:45.490 --> 28:49.193
"rotting, as if the air itself
were corrosive.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.962
Tall, pale grass grew wild
in its belly..."

28:51.964 --> 28:53.997
[voice fades out]

29:09.414 --> 29:11.014
[bell dings]
- come on.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.484
You can't say "nothing."
you must want something.

29:13.486 --> 29:16.120
- You can all do
the secret santa thing again

29:16.122 --> 29:18.756
And just leave me out of it.
- Scrooge lockhart!

29:18.758 --> 29:20.224
- Fine.

29:20.226 --> 29:24.261
I want christmas dinner here,
with all of you.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.964
- Is it christmas already?
- Oh, it's you.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.133
We're celebrating.
You're finally off crutches.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.168
- [laughs] wow.
Thanks, mom.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.237
- Dad's old records.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.338
- Garbage.

29:36.975 --> 29:39.510
- Your old records.

29:39.512 --> 29:42.045
- Garbage.
[laughter]

29:42.047 --> 29:43.514
- We should get one of
those stagers to come in

29:43.516 --> 29:45.549
And make it look good
to rich people.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.552
And bury a st. Joseph statue
in the yard.

29:48.554 --> 29:52.022
Guaranteed bidding war.
- [chuckles]

29:52.024 --> 29:56.527
Oh, that's baking powder.
You want baking soda, this one.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.495
- How can you tell?

29:59.931 --> 30:02.800
- Ali?

30:07.906 --> 30:11.542
- I want to hang onto that.
Just stick it in my bedroom.

30:14.045 --> 30:17.080
- Thank you.
- Of course, honey.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.288
- Hal and I are planning
on traveling

30:24.290 --> 30:26.023
Once the sale goes through.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.158
- Where?
- Paris.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.027
- Well, she--you know, she wants
to open a tattoo parlor.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.062
- No kidding, where?
- I don't know,

30:32.064 --> 30:34.431
Somewhere in the hamptons.
- She's gonna ink the stars.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.233
[laughter]

30:36.235 --> 30:38.302
- Well, I'm thinking about
going in on a club in the city.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.903
- What a surprise.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.438
- Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.173
- You've been going to the city
a lot these days.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.441
- Yeah, because this place is
fucking claustrophobic

30:44.443 --> 30:45.976
In the winter.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.344
- I wouldn't cut the checks
just yet.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.046
We haven't even put it
on the market.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.347
Still got a ton of work
to do here.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.115
- We don't have to do anything,
cole.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.617
We could sell the place
tomorrow, as is.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.320
- But we're not gonna do that.
- And why not?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.322
- I don't want the new owner
to come in and tear it down,

30:58.324 --> 31:00.591
And if it looks like a dump--
- dump?

31:00.593 --> 31:03.560
- You've been in their houses.
You see how those people live.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.632
There's an appraiser coming
tomorrow.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.334
He'll let us know
where we stand.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.969
After that, we can start
interviewing real estate agents.

31:11.971 --> 31:16.106
- [laughs]
"interviewing agents." jesus.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.875
- We need somebody
who understands the property,

31:17.877 --> 31:19.476
Somebody who can market it.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.012
This isn't a summer home.
It's a working ranch.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.581
- So on the market when?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.654
- I don't know,
sometime early spring?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.990
- No, absolutely not.
Bullshit, overruled, done.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.292
- Hey, cole.
Cole, look.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.095
- Oh, my god, I forgot.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.496
The bath upstairs,
I forgot to turn it off.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.164
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, ma. Ma, I got it.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.634
I got it, I got it.
- Need me to go get a bucket?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.168
- Here.

31:46.371 --> 31:48.906
- Oh, fuck!
- [gasps]

31:48.908 --> 31:50.440
- Oh, boy.
- I know.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.177
- [groans]

31:56.681 --> 31:59.416
- You can't be serious.
She's in her 50s,

31:59.418 --> 32:02.152
Miles away from senile.
You know, people forget things.

32:02.154 --> 32:05.055
- Mm-mmm.
She doesn't.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.024
Last week, she left a window
open in the rain,

32:07.026 --> 32:08.558
And that blue rug
is completely ruined.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.128
Before that, she backed herself
into a fencepost.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.262
And what the fuck
was she even doing,

32:12.264 --> 32:13.697
Running a bath before dinner?

32:13.699 --> 32:16.266
- I don't know.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.302
- I want to take her
to see a doctor.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.137
- Why?

32:20.139 --> 32:23.040
- Alzheimer's, early onset.
- [scoffs] no.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.008
There's no way.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.477
[sighs]
I'm just saying, I--

32:27.479 --> 32:29.012
Look, I think she's trying
to slow down

32:29.014 --> 32:30.681
The sale of the ranch.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.582
Why would she do that,
alison?

32:32.584 --> 32:34.584
- I don't know.
Just a feeling I had

32:34.586 --> 32:36.153
When she said
she left the tub running.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.021
It was weird.
- Well, that's exactly

32:38.023 --> 32:39.690
What I'm saying,
something's wrong.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.425
- [sighs]
ugh.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.460
God, it's so fucking cold
in here.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.963
- Get in here.
- Ooh!

32:45.965 --> 32:47.497
Ugh.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.032
- You want me
to stoke the fire?

32:49.034 --> 32:50.701
- No.
You're like a human furnace.

32:50.703 --> 32:54.304
- [laughs]

32:54.306 --> 32:57.975
- Were you okay?
At dinner?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.978
- Yeah.
Yeah, I was fine.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.717
[laughing]
don't look at me like that.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.052
That's your "I need to have
a discussion" face.

33:09.054 --> 33:12.622
I have nightmares
about that face.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.993
- What are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.761
- I'm gonna burn it, for fuel.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.998
- [scoffs]
that's a bad idea.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.336
I want you to buy something
you always wanted.

33:35.747 --> 33:41.251
- I have everything
I always wanted...

33:41.253 --> 33:44.287
Right here.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.635
[both giggle]

34:01.739 --> 34:05.375
- [grunts]
- oh.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.756
- Thanks, babe.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.362
- Hmm.
[phone ringing]

35:01.732 --> 35:05.368
Hi, athena.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.771
What?

35:07.773 --> 35:09.439
Oh, my god.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.375
What do you mean?
When?

35:12.377 --> 35:15.779
Were you with her?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.615
Which hospital?

35:18.617 --> 35:22.385
Is she okay--
okay, calm down, I'm on my way.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.589
- What happened?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.757
- Grams had a heart attack.
- Oh, shit.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.460
- She's in the I.C.U.
Look, I have to go.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.395
- I'll drive you.
- No, it's okay.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.231
My mother is there.

35:34.233 --> 35:38.268
- They called your mother first?
- Yeah, I don't know why.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.769
- You sure you don't want me
to come?

35:39.771 --> 35:41.338
- No, you have
the appraiser coming.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.307
- I can reschedule it.
- No, it's okay!

36:08.666 --> 36:10.367
- Oh, thank god you're here.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.835
I've been peppered
with questions.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.270
- Why did they call you?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.572
- Joan told them
to call her daughter.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.942
- She meant me.
And what's this?

36:18.944 --> 36:23.313
- Dennis, my daughter alison.
Alison, my friend dennis.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.714
- It's a pleasure to meet you,
alison.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.916
It's a real honor
to be in the presence

36:25.918 --> 36:29.286
Of such a powerful
female lineage.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.556
Please, let me know
if I can be of any service.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.458
- Can you give us
some privacy, please?

36:38.829 --> 36:42.199
- I'll be in the cafeteria.
- Thank you, sweetie.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.372
- What did her e.K.G. Show
when she was admitted?

36:52.276 --> 36:55.512
- I haven't had a--

36:56.948 --> 36:58.548
- I'll come back
in a few minutes.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.750
- That'd be great.
Thank you.

37:00.752 --> 37:05.755
[door opening and closing]

37:06.958 --> 37:08.558
- What was that about?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.828
- You need to consent
to a d.N.R. Order.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.964
- Excuse me?
She's--

37:13.966 --> 37:16.666
- Okay, come with me.

37:21.639 --> 37:26.710
Okay, she's been in decline
for a while now.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.979
- She's stable.
- Yes, yes, at the moment,

37:28.981 --> 37:31.448
But you mustn't cling to
the illusion of health, sweetie.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.983
Her heart is an old heart,

37:32.985 --> 37:35.352
And we need to honor
what is happening here,

37:35.354 --> 37:37.887
And make this part of her
journey as peaceful as possible.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.323
- Do you know what it means
if anything happens?

37:40.325 --> 37:42.592
Anything?
They'll let her die!

37:42.594 --> 37:44.861
If she chokes on a grape,
they won't save her.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.529
- She's not gonna choke
on a grape

37:46.531 --> 37:48.331
Because she eats baby food.
- Look, I know nothing

37:48.333 --> 37:50.000
Would make you happier
than to be rid of her

37:50.002 --> 37:52.769
So you can sail off to
some chakra sunset, guilt-free,

37:52.771 --> 37:54.938
But she's my grandm--
- please, stop.

37:57.908 --> 38:00.944
At times like these, we need
to act from our higher selves.

38:02.346 --> 38:05.415
I'm getting a cup
of fucking tea.

38:18.362 --> 38:21.898
- I'm looking for it.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.568
Well, you're the appraiser.
Can't you tell?

38:28.773 --> 38:33.677
No, the roof on the stable
is 11 years old.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.512
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
receipts.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.913
What can I tell you?

38:36.915 --> 38:38.648
My mother didn't keep
very good records.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.850
She was a little busy
raising a family on her own.

38:43.421 --> 38:45.522
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I get it, I get it.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.692
Just give me a couple days.
Bye.

38:48.694 --> 38:53.396
Sorry about that.
It's the appraiser.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.598
How's your granny?

38:55.600 --> 39:00.403
- She's okay.
I-I think she's okay.

39:00.405 --> 39:02.405
She knows what's going on.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.007
- That's a good sign, right?

39:04.009 --> 39:08.011
- Mm.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.014
Athena wants me to consent
to a d.N.R.

39:12.483 --> 39:14.884
- Do not resuscitate.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.854
- Do you think I should do it?

39:17.856 --> 39:20.090
- I don't know, ali.
Do you want to?

39:20.092 --> 39:21.891
- No.

39:21.893 --> 39:25.562
- Then don't do it.

39:33.971 --> 39:36.906
[sighs]

39:43.881 --> 39:46.449
Appraiser's fucking useless.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.118
He told me he can't
give me an estimate

39:48.120 --> 39:49.853
Because he doesn't have comps,
but there are no other

39:49.855 --> 39:51.921
200-year old working ranches
out in montauk,

39:51.923 --> 39:54.991
Which is kind of the point.
Fucking idiot.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.127
- Do you need the car later?
- Yeah, I got to run

39:57.129 --> 39:59.028
Down to the hardware store
with caleb and get some tile.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.132
Why?
- I have a catering job.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.501
- Where?
- Boden hall.

40:04.503 --> 40:08.004
Can you drop me?
- Yeah, of course I can.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.140
What's the event?
- Don't know.

40:10.142 --> 40:13.143
Don't care.

40:13.145 --> 40:16.780
[shivers]

40:16.782 --> 40:21.484
God.
I just can't get warm.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.022
- What's happening tonight?

40:26.024 --> 40:29.526
- A literary society, I think.
Some sort of award.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.629
- For who?
- Oh, he's famous.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.765
He wrote <i>castle of man.</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:39.436
- Bruce butler?
- I think so.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.641
- Whole kitchen's gluten-free,
I need you

40:44.643 --> 40:45.642
To make sure there's no--
- nadine?

40:45.644 --> 40:47.577
- Yes?
- Can I go home?

40:47.579 --> 40:49.212
- W--no, why?
- I-I just--

40:49.214 --> 40:52.115
I'm not feeling well.
- [scoffs]

40:52.117 --> 40:55.652
I'm really understaffed
tonight, ali.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.053
Can you take an advil
and power through?

40:57.055 --> 40:58.788
I'll put you on coat check.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.191
That way, you don't have to
move around very much.

41:01.193 --> 41:04.527
- Okay.
- Thank you.

41:04.529 --> 41:07.530
- Listen, did you get that?
Gluten-free.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.002
- Thank you.

41:18.976 --> 41:22.212
Ah, the man of the hour.

41:22.214 --> 41:26.015
- I suppose so.
- Have a good night, mr. Butler.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.101
- Miss?

41:45.103 --> 41:48.771
Miss?
- Sorry.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.208
Have a good night.

41:56.647 --> 42:00.083
- Traitor.

42:04.855 --> 42:08.825
- It's the only thing
I could find.

42:11.729 --> 42:16.266
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:16.268 --> 42:19.302
- Good to see you.

42:19.304 --> 42:23.873
- You too.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.779
I haven't smoked
since this summer.

42:29.781 --> 42:33.650
No, really, I haven't.

42:33.652 --> 42:37.153
- Okay.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.228
So your family didn't come?

42:45.230 --> 42:47.764
- No.
- Why not?

42:50.100 --> 42:55.171
- Can we not talk
about my family?

42:55.173 --> 42:57.307
- Sure.

43:05.316 --> 43:08.318
- You look so beautiful.

43:16.327 --> 43:21.331
- You know, things have been
good between cole and me lately.

43:21.333 --> 43:22.865
Really good.

43:25.669 --> 43:29.606
We're trying to get pregnant,
actually.

43:32.009 --> 43:36.746
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah, it is.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.752
- Well, I guess I should

43:42.754 --> 43:48.625
Go back inside
before my absence is felt.

43:48.627 --> 43:53.930
- Yeah.
Probably a good idea.

44:00.237 --> 44:06.109
[cell phone ringing]

44:06.111 --> 44:10.880
- Hello?
What?

44:10.882 --> 44:14.684
Oh, okay, when?

44:16.320 --> 44:19.188
Oh.
Yeah, okay, um--

44:28.165 --> 44:31.401
I appreciate the ride.

44:31.403 --> 44:36.139
- I can stay
and drive you home later.

44:36.141 --> 44:39.208
- Take care, noah.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.062
- Do you know what it looks like

44:59.064 --> 45:01.798
To see a pit crew
of western medical professionals

45:01.800 --> 45:05.034
Trying to jumpstart
a heart that's done?

45:05.036 --> 45:07.370
Ribs were cracked!
Electricity--

45:07.372 --> 45:09.439
- Stop, please.
- Her lungs, done.

45:09.441 --> 45:12.241
Her kidneys, done.
Suddenly, everything is done.

45:12.243 --> 45:13.843
It c--
- maybe you'd like to go

45:13.845 --> 45:16.846
Into the family room?
- No, we wouldn't.

45:19.316 --> 45:22.919
- Talk to the doctor, tell him
he can write the d.N.R. Order,

45:22.921 --> 45:25.321
And get those machines off her.
- Why don't you do it?

45:25.323 --> 45:26.923
- I'm not the fucking proxy.

45:26.925 --> 45:29.459
- Well, I'll sign it
over to you right now.

45:29.461 --> 45:31.260
Then you can do the dirty work.
Go ahead.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.796
Go in there and pull the plug.

45:39.269 --> 45:43.873
- Lucky you.
Here comes the calvary.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.275
[exhales]

45:56.820 --> 46:01.424
- Cafeteria's closed.
Vending machine.

46:01.426 --> 46:07.230
- I should be with her.
I should be in her room.

46:07.232 --> 46:10.433
- Well, a few minutes here
won't hurt.

46:12.836 --> 46:18.407
If it's any comfort,
I remember how this feels.

46:18.409 --> 46:20.176
My mother died in a hospital
just like this.

46:20.178 --> 46:21.844
- You--

46:21.846 --> 46:24.147
No, maybe I need to get
another doctor.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.282
I-I-I could move her
to the city.

46:26.284 --> 46:30.920
Or I could call a doctor I...

46:30.922 --> 46:35.024
Used to know.

46:35.026 --> 46:40.429
What if--
what if someone made a mistake?

46:40.431 --> 46:42.865
You know, people die
because someone...

46:42.867 --> 46:45.234
Should have known better--

46:53.877 --> 46:56.813
- Maybe I'm out of line here,
but...

46:58.916 --> 47:04.821
I know this pain...
Feels familiar.

47:07.591 --> 47:11.828
But it's different.
She's not a child.

47:17.568 --> 47:21.537
- I just--

47:24.241 --> 47:27.610
I--

47:27.612 --> 47:33.482
I need to know that I'm--
I'm not making a mistake.

47:33.484 --> 47:38.321
- You're not.
You're not.

47:38.323 --> 47:43.960
I know every cell in your body
wants to keep her alive, but...

47:43.962 --> 47:47.997
Holding on to her
is not gonna bring him back.

47:52.636 --> 47:57.139
Letting her go is
an act of compassion.

47:57.141 --> 48:03.145
Feels like hell, but...
It's compassion.

48:22.366 --> 48:26.369
- Did she have friends?

48:26.371 --> 48:31.340
- Yes.
Lots.

48:35.245 --> 48:39.282
If you want to plan a funeral,
I understand.

48:39.284 --> 48:41.651
You know, she'd want
a service at her church,

48:41.653 --> 48:44.987
But if you want
something casual after lunch--

48:44.989 --> 48:47.523
- We're headed up to rhinebeck
in the morning.

48:50.060 --> 48:52.528
- You can't wait a few days?

48:52.530 --> 48:57.266
- The pathways out here
are too muddled for me.

48:57.268 --> 49:01.003
I need to be someplace
I feel supported

49:01.005 --> 49:04.707
In order to even start
the healing process.

49:04.709 --> 49:10.713
Losing one's mother...
Whew.

49:10.715 --> 49:15.051
It's such an archetypal wound.

49:15.053 --> 49:20.489
- Yes.
It is.

49:22.192 --> 49:25.161
- [chuckles]

49:25.163 --> 49:28.130
- Have a great trip.

49:33.437 --> 49:36.439
- Yeah.

50:58.188 --> 51:01.357
- I love you.

51:04.261 --> 51:07.229
- I love you too.

51:21.745 --> 51:23.546
[car engine starts]

51:23.548 --> 51:25.448
- I'm all-in, fuck it.
- All-in?

51:25.450 --> 51:27.850
- See, that's what I was trying
to--I was trying to instigate.

51:27.852 --> 51:30.086
- I got a made-up card.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.854
- Yeah.
Stop throwing shit.

51:31.856 --> 51:35.257
[laughter]
- seriously.

51:37.461 --> 51:40.496
[indistinct chatter]

51:45.469 --> 51:47.770
- Bringing me luck.
All right, turn 'em.

[chuckles]

53:29.974 --> 53:32.341
[sniffs]

53:48.825 --> 53:53.329
- As you know, we had to delay
this memorial service

53:53.331 --> 53:56.699
Longer than we would have liked,

53:56.701 --> 54:02.471
But today, we are here and
we will not dwell on tragedy.

54:02.473 --> 54:07.009
Instead, we will remember
the life of our son,

54:07.011 --> 54:09.845
Scott lockhart.

54:09.847 --> 54:13.382
And if this crowd
is any indication,

54:13.384 --> 54:16.252
He was greatly loved.

54:18.888 --> 54:21.490
Let us pray.

54:21.492 --> 54:26.028
Lord, make me
an instrument of thy peace.

54:26.030 --> 54:27.730
Where there is hatred,
let me sow love.

54:27.732 --> 54:33.369
Where there is injury, pardon.
Where there is doubt...

54:33.371 --> 54:34.870
- Can you look something else
up for me?

54:34.872 --> 54:36.472
Labor day.
- He didn't stay with us.

54:36.474 --> 54:39.008
- I know, I know.
Try under cancellations.

54:39.010 --> 54:41.977
- Okay.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.283
Oh, wow, you're right.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.351
There was a reservation
under "solloway."

54:49.353 --> 54:53.656
It was canceled at 11:22 p.M.
- Thank you.

54:53.658 --> 54:56.692
Have a good night.
- Mm-hmm.

54:58.928 --> 55:01.563
Say, I got into a little
fender bender.

55:01.565 --> 55:04.066
Do you know someone local
who can look at my car?

55:04.068 --> 55:06.502
- Yeah, there's somebody
out here that everybody uses.

55:06.504 --> 55:09.471
Let get his number.
