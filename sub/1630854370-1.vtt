WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:10.724 --> 00:11.068
<i>Previously.</i>

00:11.689 --> 00:13.034
<i>You do stupid things-</i>

00:13.068 --> 00:15.379
<i>when you want
somebody who-</i>

00:15.413 --> 00:17.172
isn't available.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.551
You've been feeling
this way for that long?

00:21.448 --> 00:22.275
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:22.310 --> 00:23.586
I know we talked
about this already.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.862
But it's such a big
relationship step-

00:25.896 --> 00:27.172
<i>when we're not sure-</i>

00:27.206 --> 00:28.172
where it's headed.

00:28.206 --> 00:29.103
<i>Yeah, I mean-</i>

00:29.137 --> 00:30.482
We have an idea of
where things are headed.

01:09.482 --> 01:10.931
<i>Serena!</i>

01:16.344 --> 01:18.724
<i>Serena!</i>

01:23.758 --> 01:25.034
<i>Keep your eyes open!</i>

01:30.862 --> 01:31.931
All right Rex.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.000
Lunchtime.

01:33.655 --> 01:34.517
So what do
you think?

01:34.551 --> 01:35.586
<i>Serena!</i>

01:35.620 --> 01:37.551
Well if we haven't
found her body yet-

01:37.586 --> 01:38.551
there's still hope.

01:39.344 --> 01:41.413
It's still getting damn
cold at night out here.

01:41.896 --> 01:43.758
She'd have to be
tough to still be alive.

01:44.344 --> 01:45.689
Well hopefully she is.

01:46.620 --> 01:47.448
Well-

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
at least
there's free eats.

01:51.655 --> 01:53.000
There is that.

01:53.551 --> 01:54.206
Come on, pal.

01:57.241 --> 01:58.448
<i>Lunch is over here!</i>

02:15.275 --> 02:16.689
You get that thing
working yet?

02:16.724 --> 02:18.034
No, it's not
looking good.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.586
But I'll try to clean
up the footage-

02:19.620 --> 02:20.793
when we get back
to the station.

02:21.931 --> 02:23.413
Looks like locating
Serena is on you, pal.

02:24.586 --> 02:25.689
<i>Anyone find anything?</i>

02:25.793 --> 02:27.172
Except for the headband-

02:27.206 --> 02:29.241
and the few bits of fabric
we found this morning-

02:29.275 --> 02:29.965
nothing.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.172
It's a bad place
to get lost.

02:32.724 --> 02:33.827
It is that.

02:34.551 --> 02:35.896
If the cold doesn't
kill you at night-

02:35.931 --> 02:37.413
the flies will
eat you alive.

02:37.586 --> 02:38.586
Yeah yeah.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.931
Maybe Sarah's
made some progress.

02:39.965 --> 02:40.965
That stuff
got to the lab?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.206
It was on the
first shuttle out.

02:42.241 --> 02:42.896
Mm-hmm.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.034
None of the items the searchers
found belong to Serena Jones?

02:52.448 --> 02:53.965
<i>It would have been
a miracle if they did.</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:56.241
The girl's been missing
for almost 72 hours.

02:56.275 --> 02:57.413
I'd say she's
in need of one.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.137
Sorry.

03:00.103 --> 03:01.000
Hey!

03:02.103 --> 03:03.827
I hope you're not catching
your death out there.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.413
<i>We'll live.</i>

03:05.517 --> 03:06.413
Any luck?

03:06.448 --> 03:07.344
<i>No, not yet.</i>

03:07.379 --> 03:08.517
<i>But we'll keep looking.</i>

03:08.620 --> 03:09.862
But I have
to say-

03:09.896 --> 03:10.862
between you and me-

03:12.000 --> 03:13.965
this feels like it's moving
from rescue to recovery.

03:14.000 --> 03:14.689
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

03:16.689 --> 03:17.862
I know pal.

03:19.206 --> 03:20.551
I'm going to wrap
it up at sundown.

03:20.586 --> 03:21.379
Okay.

03:21.413 --> 03:22.068
<i>Later.</i>

03:22.103 --> 03:22.724
Gator.

03:22.758 --> 03:24.344
Don't do that.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.655
Sorry for the interruption.

03:30.931 --> 03:32.103
Um-

03:32.137 --> 03:35.000
So I just wanted to come and
properly introduce myself.

03:35.034 --> 03:36.689
Dr. Sarah Truong.

03:37.448 --> 03:38.275
Dr. Karma Poole.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.137
<i>Hi.</i>

03:39.965 --> 03:42.206
I wanted to
tell you that-

03:42.241 --> 03:44.241
I am really thrilled to be
part of your department.

03:44.275 --> 03:45.827
Oh, it's good to
have you aboard.

03:47.724 --> 03:48.379
So-

03:49.206 --> 03:49.965
what do you think?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.310
Do you think Derek
Spade is guilty?

03:51.344 --> 03:53.620
Joining the rest of the
world with that theory?

03:53.655 --> 03:54.931
Her posts about him
on the internet-

03:54.965 --> 03:55.965
especially that last one-

03:56.000 --> 03:57.379
where she said she
was fearing for her life.

03:57.413 --> 03:58.068
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:58.103 --> 04:00.103
In here we
don't speculate.

04:02.275 --> 04:02.931
Right.

04:02.965 --> 04:04.137
<i>Of course not.</i>

04:05.241 --> 04:06.068
But-

04:09.551 --> 04:11.896
it does seem likely.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.448
How long are you going
to hide from them?

04:24.482 --> 04:26.172
As long as
I have to.

04:26.827 --> 04:28.103
<i>I've got half
a mind to just-</i>

04:28.137 --> 04:29.827
I think you're giving yourself
too much credit there.

04:31.655 --> 04:34.724
I've got half a mind to
just open the door for them.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.206
Is that a part of
serving and protecting?

04:37.241 --> 04:37.965
<i>Letting them at you-</i>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.655
would be serving
the public.

04:39.896 --> 04:40.655
That's for sure.

04:40.689 --> 04:42.448
You know, why
don't you leave?

04:42.896 --> 04:44.551
I'm tired of having
you here anyway.

04:45.413 --> 04:46.103
<i>Go!</i>

04:46.206 --> 04:47.103
<i>Take cover!
Take cover!</i>

04:48.103 --> 04:49.413
This is Constable Decker.

04:49.448 --> 04:50.655
<i>118 Admiral's Lane.</i>

04:50.689 --> 04:51.689
<i>Requiring assistance.
- Come on!</i>

04:51.724 --> 04:52.758
<i>Stay away from
the windows!</i>

05:09.724 --> 05:11.000
<i>We want justice!</i>

05:20.689 --> 05:22.344
<i>What have you
been doing?</i>

05:22.448 --> 05:23.827
<i>We know
what he did!</i>

05:23.862 --> 05:24.689
<i>That's right!</i>

05:24.724 --> 05:26.413
<i>We know!</i>

05:26.448 --> 05:27.793
This is private property!

05:27.827 --> 05:29.103
<i>Please disperse!</i>

05:29.275 --> 05:30.827
Please disperse!

05:30.862 --> 05:33.448
Listen, I need you guys to
get these people out of here.

05:33.482 --> 05:35.482
Set up a hard perimeter
if you have to.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.517
You still haven't done
anything have you?

05:37.551 --> 05:38.586
We're still looking
for your sister.

05:38.620 --> 05:39.689
<i>Believe me!</i>

05:39.724 --> 05:41.172
Why don't you get him
to tell you where she is?

05:46.931 --> 05:47.586
No.

05:48.551 --> 05:49.448
<i>It's in
your best interest.</i>

05:49.482 --> 05:51.034
And you know what
my best interests are?

05:51.068 --> 05:53.241
<i>What I do know is there's a
lot of angry people out there-</i>

05:53.275 --> 05:54.551
who are looking
to do you harm.

05:54.586 --> 05:55.827
Then get them
out of here.

05:55.862 --> 05:57.379
I'm going to take
you into custody.

05:57.413 --> 05:58.310
You can't do that.

05:58.344 --> 05:59.482
I didn't do
anything wrong!

05:59.517 --> 06:00.206
<i>I don't know that.</i>

06:00.241 --> 06:01.862
And frankly, I
don't even care.

06:01.896 --> 06:02.896
<i>Listen to me.</i>

06:03.379 --> 06:04.241
<i>I'm here to
protect you.</i>

06:04.275 --> 06:05.793
So we can do it
one of two ways.

06:05.827 --> 06:06.758
Either peacefully-

06:07.620 --> 06:08.827
or I can put
you in cuffs.

06:46.827 --> 06:47.482
<i>Heya.</i>

06:48.000 --> 06:50.034
Is this the
famous Rex?

06:50.068 --> 06:51.379
Yeah, it is.

06:51.413 --> 06:52.068
Hmm.

06:54.586 --> 06:55.413
You have
something to say?

06:55.448 --> 06:56.275
<i>I guess you
can't believe-</i>

06:56.310 --> 06:58.379
everything you read
in the papers.

06:58.482 --> 06:59.206
Excuse me?

06:59.241 --> 07:00.241
<i>Well if he
was as good-</i>

07:00.275 --> 07:01.172
as they
say he was-

07:01.206 --> 07:02.379
we would have
found her by now.

07:05.379 --> 07:07.620
The SJPD appreciates
your assistance.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.517
No, he didn't mean
anything by it, pal.

07:10.551 --> 07:13.517
This whole thing's just got
everybody a little rattled.

07:19.965 --> 07:23.482
Well, that is all I could
retrieve before the crash.

07:23.517 --> 07:24.310
<i>So nothing.</i>

07:24.344 --> 07:26.344
Derek reveal
anything of interest?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.551
I talked to him
for three hours.

07:27.586 --> 07:29.034
He tells the
same story.

07:29.068 --> 07:30.103
And he
tells it well.

07:30.137 --> 07:31.448
Maybe too well?

07:31.482 --> 07:32.137
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:32.172 --> 07:32.793
I don't know.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.103
He's a tough
one to read.

07:34.137 --> 07:35.137
Yeah he and
Serena went out-

07:35.172 --> 07:37.379
into the barrens
for an overnight.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.241
They got
into a fight.

07:38.275 --> 07:39.448
She left in a
fit of anger.

07:39.482 --> 07:40.344
Never came back.

07:40.379 --> 07:41.379
After a while,
he went looking.

07:41.413 --> 07:42.586
But couldn't find
a trace of her.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.448
So he reported her
disappearance-

07:43.482 --> 07:44.310
as soon
as he could.

07:44.344 --> 07:45.241
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:45.275 --> 07:46.172
And he hasn't wavered
from that account.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.137
Even though it's
nothing but lies?!

07:50.965 --> 07:51.965
How did you
get in here?

07:52.000 --> 07:52.827
<i>Some uniformed cops-</i>

07:52.862 --> 07:54.793
who believe in
justice let me in.

07:55.724 --> 07:56.413
Easy, pal.

07:56.448 --> 07:57.103
Stay.

07:58.172 --> 08:01.206
So are you finally
going to do something?

08:01.241 --> 08:02.206
<i>Yes.</i>

08:02.241 --> 08:03.448
I'm going to have you
escorted out of here.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.172
He murdered my sister!

08:05.206 --> 08:06.103
We don't know that.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.034
No, I do!

08:07.068 --> 08:07.965
I know that!

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And all you are doing
is protecting him?

08:11.793 --> 08:12.689
<i>Can you two please-</i>

08:12.724 --> 08:14.137
escort Ms. Jones
out of here.

08:14.172 --> 08:14.793
Thank you.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.827
We are doing
what we can.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.689
Which is nothing!

08:21.034 --> 08:21.689
Yeah, I know.

08:21.724 --> 08:23.724
Yeah, good job.

08:25.758 --> 08:26.689
I don't blame her.

08:26.724 --> 08:29.000
I mean, this is almost
like Gabby Petito.

08:29.862 --> 08:31.103
The woman from Florida-

08:31.137 --> 08:32.689
who went on a road
trip with her boyfriend-

08:32.724 --> 08:33.379
and never came back?

08:33.413 --> 08:34.206
Yeah.

08:34.241 --> 08:35.793
Jesse, that's the
kind of gossip-

08:35.827 --> 08:37.000
that makes an
innocent man guilty.

08:37.034 --> 08:37.655
I'm just saying.

08:37.689 --> 08:38.862
<i>I know.</i>

08:38.896 --> 08:41.241
You and the rest
of the world.

08:41.275 --> 08:41.896
<i>Hey.</i>

08:41.931 --> 08:42.758
Everything okay?

08:42.793 --> 08:43.862
Yeah.

08:43.896 --> 08:45.896
I'm just thinking of that
poor woman out there-

08:45.931 --> 08:47.000
freezing to death.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.758
<i>Yeah, well
maybe Rex and I-</i>

08:48.793 --> 08:50.206
can bring her
home safe.

08:50.862 --> 08:51.482
Let's go pal.

08:51.517 --> 08:52.172
All right.

08:54.758 --> 08:55.413
Great.

08:56.758 --> 08:57.758
Joe!

08:58.275 --> 08:59.034
A word?

08:59.931 --> 09:01.172
Do I have
a choice?

09:01.206 --> 09:02.413
What do you think?

09:07.137 --> 09:08.551
So Natalia.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.620
When did you start
working pro-bono?

09:10.655 --> 09:11.655
Who says I'm working-

09:11.689 --> 09:13.965
Well I doubt Derek
Spade can afford you.

09:15.310 --> 09:16.068
Nice talk.

09:16.758 --> 09:17.931
<i>Charge or release, Joe.</i>

09:17.965 --> 09:19.448
<i>Mr. Spade doesn't want
to remain in custody.</i>

09:19.482 --> 09:20.620
I have every right
to hold him.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.448
Not forever, Joe.

09:22.482 --> 09:23.482
The longer
you hold him-

09:23.517 --> 09:24.827
the more my client
looks guilty.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.551
<i>And that's not fair.</i>

09:27.482 --> 09:28.413
He'll be out soon.

09:29.241 --> 09:30.000
<i>Good to know.</i>

09:33.931 --> 09:34.586
Sarah.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.310
I need you to take another
shot at talking to Mr. Spade.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.896
I need you to warm
him up a little.

09:39.931 --> 09:41.931
A little old school <i>
good cop bad cop</i>-

09:41.965 --> 09:43.275
is what we need
right now.

09:43.379 --> 09:43.931
Got it.

09:43.965 --> 09:45.000
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:51.620 --> 09:53.620
[yelling] <i>Serena Jones!</i>

09:54.620 --> 09:55.517
What is it pal?

09:58.034 --> 10:00.275
Hey, sorry about earlier.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.862
<i>That was
out of line.</i>

10:02.896 --> 10:04.137
Ah, it's no problem.

10:04.172 --> 10:05.137
Rex and I
forgive you.

10:06.655 --> 10:08.000
Oh, don't
be like that.

10:10.034 --> 10:12.655
Still, seems a bit
pointless don't it?

10:12.689 --> 10:13.482
Well I don't know.

10:13.517 --> 10:14.724
We still haven't
found a body yet.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.206
There's hope.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.241
Yeah.

10:17.275 --> 10:18.551
Sure you remember
those two tourists-

10:18.586 --> 10:20.103
who went missing out
here a few years ago?

10:20.137 --> 10:21.793
Germans.

10:21.827 --> 10:23.068
Real outdoor types.

10:23.896 --> 10:24.689
Fit as fiddles.

10:25.689 --> 10:27.137
They barely
lasted 48 hours.

10:28.793 --> 10:30.931
What chance you figure
a young girl has?

10:32.275 --> 10:33.413
Well, she's a local.

10:33.448 --> 10:36.068
I think you might
be selling her short.

10:36.103 --> 10:36.965
<i>Maybe so.</i>

10:37.758 --> 10:39.172
But the way
I figure it-

10:39.206 --> 10:41.586
the barrens don't give a damn
whether you're local or not.

10:46.655 --> 10:47.310
Come on, pal.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.275
[yelling] Serena!

10:59.172 --> 11:00.034
<i>Hello.</i>

11:00.344 --> 11:01.862
My name is Sarah.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.034
Hi Sarah.

11:03.068 --> 11:04.172
When can
I go home?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.517
I'm not sure
it's safe.

11:06.551 --> 11:08.379
Safe or not, it's still
better than here.

11:09.862 --> 11:12.413
I wanted to clarify
some details-

11:12.448 --> 11:14.206
about the trip you
and Serena took.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.241
Yeah, I've already told your
boss everything I know.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.965
But I will tell you the
only thing that matters.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.551
I didn't kill Serena.

11:20.655 --> 11:22.482
I am sorry
she is missing.

11:22.517 --> 11:24.620
But I am sure she will
turn up somewhere.

11:24.655 --> 11:25.482
Why do you
say that?

11:25.517 --> 11:26.586
We had a fight!

11:26.620 --> 11:30.000
We had a lot
of fights lately!

11:30.034 --> 11:33.482
And she always
runs from conflict.

11:33.517 --> 11:36.724
And she wrote about
your fights on the Internet.

11:37.551 --> 11:39.241
Making me look
like a monster.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.862
That's the reason her
family is camped on my lawn-

11:41.896 --> 11:43.862
throwing rocks
through my window.

11:43.896 --> 11:45.137
They should
be in jail.

11:46.241 --> 11:47.413
You don't seem
to care much-

11:47.448 --> 11:49.344
<i>about what
happened to her.</i>

11:49.379 --> 11:50.344
Of course I care.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.758
<i>But me caring-</i>

11:51.793 --> 11:53.206
does nothing
to find her.

11:53.241 --> 11:56.344
Just like you wasting
your time talking to me-

11:56.379 --> 11:57.689
<i>does nothing to
find her either.</i>

11:57.724 --> 11:58.689
I see.

11:59.896 --> 12:00.931
But I-

12:00.965 --> 12:02.000
Are you charging me?

12:03.413 --> 12:07.068
We are still thinking
about next steps.

12:07.862 --> 12:11.310
Oh, well let me tell you what
your next steps should be.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.275
Release the innocent man-

12:13.310 --> 12:16.379
and wait for Serena
to phone home.

12:25.137 --> 12:25.965
[shouting] <i>Serena!</i>

13:00.206 --> 13:01.586
<i>Sir, what
is the status?</i>

13:01.620 --> 13:03.137
The body of Serena
Jones was found-

13:03.172 --> 13:06.034
through the joint efforts of
police, search and rescue-

13:06.068 --> 13:07.103
and concerned citizens.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.862
<i>I'd like to thank them
all for their efforts.</i>

13:08.896 --> 13:11.482
I'd also like to send
my deepest condolences-

13:11.517 --> 13:14.551
and sympathies to the family
and friends of the victim.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.965
<i>What are you doing
about Derek Spade?</i>

13:18.758 --> 13:20.482
Derek Spade is
currently in custody-

13:20.517 --> 13:21.931
for questioning.

13:21.965 --> 13:24.034
And that's all we
can say at this time.

13:24.068 --> 13:25.241
<i>How long
can you hold him?</i>

13:25.275 --> 13:26.724
<i>You have my
sister's murderer-</i>

13:26.758 --> 13:28.137
behind bars.

13:28.827 --> 13:30.000
Do something!

13:32.655 --> 13:34.000
We are investigating
the circumstances-

13:34.034 --> 13:35.586
surrounding her death.

13:35.620 --> 13:36.793
And the moment we
find out anything-

13:36.827 --> 13:38.206
we'll be sure to
let you all know.

13:38.655 --> 13:39.482
Let's go.

13:39.517 --> 13:41.000
I told you this was
a waste of time.

13:44.206 --> 13:45.586
<i>Sir, how
long can you hold him?</i>

13:47.965 --> 13:49.724
<i>Has he spoken
to a lawyer yet?</i>

13:54.034 --> 13:54.827
Serena Jones.

13:55.344 --> 13:56.655
27 years old.

13:56.689 --> 13:57.689
Caucasian.

13:57.724 --> 13:58.586
Female.

14:00.344 --> 14:03.034
I was really hoping she
wasn't going to end up here.

14:03.068 --> 14:04.000
You're not alone.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.758
Have you had a chance to
make a preliminary assessment?

14:07.793 --> 14:08.758
Yes.

14:08.793 --> 14:10.206
She has a few
things to tell us.

14:10.241 --> 14:12.172
<i>Partial frostbite.</i>

14:12.206 --> 14:12.827
<i>Ring, index-</i>

14:12.862 --> 14:14.241
<i>pinky finger.</i>

14:14.275 --> 14:14.896
<i>Left hand.</i>

14:14.931 --> 14:16.517
Likely post mortem.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.103
There's evidence of
animal interference.

14:19.137 --> 14:21.034
Also likely post mortem.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.689
Have you had a chance to
estimate time of death?

14:23.724 --> 14:25.000
She died about
70 hours ago.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.000
<i>So very shortly-</i>

14:26.034 --> 14:28.448
after Derek Spade said
she ran away from him.

14:28.482 --> 14:29.413
More precisely-

14:29.448 --> 14:31.275
between one and
three hours-

14:31.310 --> 14:33.241
after Derek Spade said
she ran away from him.

14:34.379 --> 14:35.172
Anything else?

14:35.206 --> 14:37.413
I've only done a
visual assessment.

14:37.448 --> 14:39.413
A full autopsy
may reveal more.

14:39.448 --> 14:41.448
I'll let you know as soon
as I get a closer look.

14:41.482 --> 14:43.275
Okay.

14:43.310 --> 14:43.965
<i>Wait.</i>

14:46.448 --> 14:48.000
You don't want
to stick around?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.137
Carry on, Dr. Poole.

14:51.034 --> 14:51.689
Dr. Truong.

14:54.413 --> 14:55.448
I know you don't
like speculation.

14:56.448 --> 14:57.689
But?

14:57.724 --> 15:00.310
<i>You might want to consider
that this was an accident.</i>

15:00.344 --> 15:02.275
Or a suicide.

15:02.896 --> 15:03.862
Why do you
say that?

15:03.896 --> 15:05.275
<i>From what I can
see on social media-</i>

15:07.068 --> 15:08.931
this was not a
happy young woman.

15:11.068 --> 15:12.586
So no charges?

15:12.620 --> 15:13.793
<i>Not at this time.</i>

15:13.827 --> 15:15.896
You and I both
know he likely did it.

15:15.931 --> 15:17.689
Well we don't go
to court on likely.

15:17.724 --> 15:18.758
You know that.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.034
<i>Detective Hudson.</i>

15:20.068 --> 15:21.379
Did you find anything
on the scene-

15:21.413 --> 15:22.448
to suggest Serena
was murdered?

15:22.482 --> 15:24.931
Just her body at
the bottom of a berm.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.034
So she could
have fallen?

15:26.068 --> 15:27.103
And she could
have been pushed.

15:29.413 --> 15:30.586
Look I know
this sucks for you.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.827
But if we are to bring
charges against Derek Spade-

15:32.862 --> 15:34.068
I want to be
sure they stick.

15:34.103 --> 15:35.172
<i>There aren't
many people here-</i>

15:35.206 --> 15:36.206
who would be
happy about that.

15:36.241 --> 15:36.896
<i>Join the club.</i>

15:36.931 --> 15:37.551
Besides-

15:37.586 --> 15:38.275
what's the big deal?

15:38.310 --> 15:39.206
Everyone hates cops nowadays.

15:41.034 --> 15:41.965
Just like they
hate judges-

15:42.000 --> 15:44.172
and crown attorneys
who don't press charges.

15:44.206 --> 15:47.103
But we all sleep better at night
knowing we did the right thing.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.103
<i>Agreed?</i>

15:50.275 --> 15:51.310
Yeah, agreed.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.172
Thanks Michael.

15:53.206 --> 15:54.310
Don't mention it.

15:54.551 --> 15:56.379
Good job finding
Serena, Rex.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.068
You brought the
family some peace.

15:58.103 --> 15:59.827
<i>Even if they
don't feel it yet.</i>

16:00.827 --> 16:01.793
<i>Yeah, you're
a good boy.</i>

16:09.413 --> 16:10.103
Listen, Derek.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.448
I want you
to stay put.

16:11.482 --> 16:12.620
Okay?

16:12.655 --> 16:14.068
<i>Do not go anywhere.</i>

16:14.103 --> 16:15.103
Where would I go?

16:15.137 --> 16:16.827
I'm going to be a
prisoner in my own home.

16:16.862 --> 16:19.172
Yeah, well,
there's much worse.

16:19.206 --> 16:20.758
And much better.

16:22.758 --> 16:23.655
What do you think?

16:24.344 --> 16:27.034
I'm going to wait for
the final autopsy.

16:27.068 --> 16:28.413
Come on, you
talked to him.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.793
He's not exactly
an empath.

16:29.827 --> 16:31.103
But that doesn't
make him guilty.

16:32.379 --> 16:34.482
What about when you
look into his eyes?

16:34.517 --> 16:35.206
Nothing.

16:35.310 --> 16:37.000
<i>He gives me nothing.</i>

16:37.034 --> 16:38.413
<i>I don't like
the sound of that.</i>

16:40.724 --> 16:41.655
Hey!

16:42.103 --> 16:43.103
Hey.

16:43.724 --> 16:45.344
Thanks for finding
Serena, boy.

16:46.034 --> 16:47.103
That's interesting.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.758
Where are you going?

16:50.862 --> 16:53.965
I'm off to have an
uncomfortable conversation.

17:05.448 --> 17:06.379
Hi.

17:07.310 --> 17:10.344
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

17:10.379 --> 17:11.275
Well, I just-

17:13.068 --> 17:15.655
I wanted to say how sorry
I am about your sister.

17:17.034 --> 17:18.344
Next time just
send a card.

17:18.379 --> 17:19.000
<i>Look, I know-</i>

17:19.034 --> 17:20.172
you're hurting.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.379
You don't know
the half of it.

17:21.413 --> 17:23.068
<i>Don't leave, please.</i>

17:31.413 --> 17:32.310
What was she like?

17:35.172 --> 17:37.310
She was my
kid sister.

17:37.344 --> 17:38.448
You know-

17:38.482 --> 17:39.655
a royal pain
in the ass.

17:44.068 --> 17:47.689
When we were little she used to
steal my clothes without asking.

17:47.724 --> 17:49.448
And tag along when
I didn't want her to.

17:51.517 --> 17:53.379
And drive me crazy.

17:53.482 --> 17:55.000
<i>And now I'm
going to miss her-</i>

17:55.034 --> 17:57.310
every day for
the rest of my life.

17:58.586 --> 17:59.482
So-

18:00.620 --> 18:01.655
<i>What was she like-</i>

18:02.586 --> 18:03.586
recently?

18:04.827 --> 18:07.137
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

18:07.172 --> 18:08.413
I haven't said anything.

18:09.103 --> 18:11.586
I'm not stupid.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.931
You think she
killed herself.

18:12.965 --> 18:15.000
<i>She was happy.</i>

18:15.034 --> 18:16.000
She'd finally
made a decision.

18:16.034 --> 18:18.172
She was going to dump
Derek and move on.

18:18.206 --> 18:19.758
I'd been asking her
to do it for weeks.

18:20.965 --> 18:21.758
<i>She finally listened.</i>

18:21.793 --> 18:24.344
And look at
what happened!

18:24.379 --> 18:26.103
You think she killed
herself or something.

18:26.137 --> 18:28.310
No, we just haven't
found any evidence-

18:28.344 --> 18:29.413
<i>that Mr. Spade-</i>

18:29.448 --> 18:31.517
I don't care what you found
or what you didn't find.

18:31.551 --> 18:32.862
This wasn't an accident.

18:32.896 --> 18:34.482
She didn't kill herself!

18:34.517 --> 18:36.000
<i>She didn't fall down!</i>

18:36.034 --> 18:37.689
Do your damn job!

18:37.724 --> 18:40.034
And stop
disrespecting my sister.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.344
You okay?

18:51.862 --> 18:53.586
Yeah.

18:53.689 --> 18:55.827
Well, you
gave it a stab.

18:55.862 --> 18:57.034
I would have
done the same.

18:57.724 --> 18:59.103
Yeah, except
all I did was-

19:00.655 --> 19:02.241
create a new wound.

19:04.206 --> 19:05.206
Hey.

19:13.379 --> 19:14.448
Hey.

19:14.482 --> 19:15.827
<i>Looks like Derek Spade
has gone underground.</i>

19:15.862 --> 19:17.413
What are you
talking about?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.206
He's deleted every one of
his social media profiles.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.862
I contacted his
service provider.

19:20.896 --> 19:22.413
He's cancelled all
of his accounts.

19:22.448 --> 19:23.793
So he's cutting himself
off from the world.

19:23.827 --> 19:24.793
<i>I mean-</i>

19:24.827 --> 19:26.862
if you read what was
being said about him-

19:26.896 --> 19:28.172
you wouldn't blame him.

19:28.206 --> 19:29.896
Well I will say a prayer
for Derek Spade tonight.

19:29.931 --> 19:30.551
<i>Hey.</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:31.379
Look, boss.

19:31.413 --> 19:33.724
I mean what if
we're wrong?

19:33.758 --> 19:34.862
<i>What if he
didn't do it?</i>

19:34.896 --> 19:36.793
Well then I will
feel like crap.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.172
And I'll wake up next morning
and continue to do my job.

19:39.206 --> 19:40.448
Because right now, Jesse-

19:40.482 --> 19:41.689
he's our number
one suspect.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.310
They're still in
front of his house.

19:43.344 --> 19:45.241
Okay what do you
want me to do, Natalia?

19:45.275 --> 19:47.586
Do you want me to arrest the
grieving family of a dead woman?

19:47.620 --> 19:48.827
<i>Hey, I
feel bad for them.</i>

19:48.862 --> 19:51.000
But my client needs
police protection.

19:51.034 --> 19:52.620
We do not have the
manpower for that.

19:52.655 --> 19:54.000
<i>Something happens
to Derek Spade-</i>

19:54.034 --> 19:55.896
and we'll see if you
can afford the lawsuit.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.517
You're a
good cop, Joe.

20:01.068 --> 20:02.620
Do the right thing.

20:03.551 --> 20:04.793
The problem is-

20:04.827 --> 20:06.793
the right thing means different
things to different people.

20:19.034 --> 20:19.827
I don't like this.

20:22.827 --> 20:24.137
Think of it as
an opportunity.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.620
How so?

20:26.758 --> 20:27.862
Our prime suspect has
invited you into his house.

20:27.896 --> 20:30.034
You can conduct all the
warrantless searches you want.

20:34.482 --> 20:35.862
Uhhh.

20:35.896 --> 20:36.793
What's on your mind?

20:36.827 --> 20:38.586
It troubles me
that Rex likes him.

20:39.931 --> 20:41.137
Maybe Rex is right.

20:41.172 --> 20:42.931
And we're protecting
an innocent man.

20:44.172 --> 20:45.827
<i>I didn't look
at it that way.</i>

20:45.862 --> 20:48.103
Seems to me either
me or Rex is wrong.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.965
Well, even the best
of friends disagree.

21:04.896 --> 21:05.896
So how are
you feeling?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.379
Persecuted.

21:10.413 --> 21:11.448
That's it?

21:11.482 --> 21:14.551
Hey, I'm sad
that Serena died.

21:14.586 --> 21:16.965
But there was nothing I could do
to stop that from happening.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.206
And there's nothing I
can do to bring her back.

21:21.344 --> 21:23.172
<i>Just like you can't stop
what those people outside-</i>

21:23.206 --> 21:24.275
are trying
to do to me.

21:25.103 --> 21:26.137
You should have
seen the stuff-

21:26.172 --> 21:27.206
they were saying
about me online.

21:27.241 --> 21:29.344
That why you disconnected?

21:30.551 --> 21:31.551
You saw that
did you?

21:31.586 --> 21:32.517
<i>We're watching
what you do.</i>

21:33.172 --> 21:34.172
You're still a suspect.

21:35.551 --> 21:37.586
Will be for the rest
of my life, I guess.

21:38.137 --> 21:39.655
At least your
dog likes me.

21:45.965 --> 21:47.620
What is it Rex?

21:49.310 --> 21:50.482
What's going on?

21:50.896 --> 21:51.551
I don't know.

21:53.965 --> 21:54.586
Stay put.

21:54.620 --> 21:55.275
Rex!

22:08.862 --> 22:09.620
Hi.

22:09.655 --> 22:10.965
<i>Run!</i>

22:11.000 --> 22:12.068
<i>Rex, go!</i>

22:25.724 --> 22:26.827
On your feet.

22:27.517 --> 22:28.758
Come on, get up.

22:29.344 --> 22:30.448
Slowly.

22:32.103 --> 22:33.068
Names?

22:34.206 --> 22:35.172
Trey Park.

22:35.344 --> 22:36.482
Jessika Warren.

22:37.172 --> 22:38.965
What the hell were
you two doing?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.206
<i>What's
it look like?</i>

22:40.241 --> 22:41.137
Sending a message.

22:41.689 --> 22:44.206
Oh, well now I get
to do the same.

22:44.241 --> 22:44.862
Detective Hudson.

22:44.896 --> 22:45.620
We have a 10-100-

22:45.655 --> 22:48.103
<i>at 118 Admiral's Lane.</i>

22:58.413 --> 23:00.068
Two in one
blow, Rex.

23:00.103 --> 23:01.448
You're getting pretty fancy.

23:08.241 --> 23:09.068
Derek!

23:17.517 --> 23:18.241
Aghh!

23:27.689 --> 23:29.862
This is far from
as good as it gets.

23:29.896 --> 23:30.965
We've got
everyone locked up-

23:31.000 --> 23:32.620
except for our
suspected killer, Charlie.

23:32.655 --> 23:33.551
And we let
him go.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.172
They were trying to
burn down his house.

23:36.206 --> 23:36.827
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

23:36.862 --> 23:38.344
We need
to find him.

23:38.379 --> 23:39.310
Yeah, we're
on our way.

23:39.344 --> 23:40.896
I just need a minute
with these two first.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.310
That's got to
be Chief Lassiter.

23:46.344 --> 23:47.206
I've got
to take this.

23:47.241 --> 23:48.275
Yeah, I'll leave
you to it.

23:48.310 --> 23:50.137
Yeah, I'm not getting
a gold star on this one.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.482
Rex, come on.

23:53.793 --> 23:54.655
Donovan.

23:58.586 --> 23:59.793
Serena was my friend.

24:00.793 --> 24:01.862
Yeah, I get that.

24:01.896 --> 24:02.931
<i>It's all her
stupid fault.</i>

24:02.965 --> 24:04.137
Why do you
say that?

24:04.172 --> 24:06.000
She should have
never been with Derek.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.517
Easy pal.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.241
The guy was trouble.

24:14.275 --> 24:15.482
<i>Look, I
understand that.</i>

24:15.517 --> 24:17.034
But there's a difference between
being upset about a friend-

24:17.068 --> 24:17.931
and trying to
kill someone.

24:17.965 --> 24:19.758
That wouldn't have happened.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.275
The place wouldn't
have burnt down.

24:21.310 --> 24:22.379
There were people everywhere.

24:23.241 --> 24:24.034
Then why do it?

24:24.068 --> 24:25.482
<i>Just sending
a message.</i>

24:26.000 --> 24:27.206
The guy is not
welcome here.

24:31.689 --> 24:32.758
<i>Hey Jesse.</i>

24:32.793 --> 24:34.310
You want to find out what
you can about these two?

24:34.344 --> 24:34.965
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

24:35.000 --> 24:35.620
<i>We charging them?</i>

24:35.655 --> 24:36.517
That's up to Joe.

24:37.241 --> 24:38.275
Karma.

24:38.310 --> 24:38.965
<i>Come again?</i>

24:39.000 --> 24:40.137
The new hire
at the morgue.

24:40.172 --> 24:41.172
You haven't met her.

24:41.206 --> 24:42.448
No, should I?

24:43.206 --> 24:44.344
Time and place, Jesse.

24:44.448 --> 24:45.137
Rex.

24:45.172 --> 24:46.551
<i>Hey, Karma.</i>

24:57.137 --> 24:58.241
You have something?

24:58.275 --> 24:59.241
I do.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.172
<i>You see that?</i>

25:03.793 --> 25:05.000
Did she get that
in the fall?

25:05.034 --> 25:05.931
I don't think so.

25:05.965 --> 25:07.344
<i>Based on the location-</i>

25:07.379 --> 25:08.517
and the shape-

25:08.551 --> 25:10.206
I think she
was struck.

25:10.241 --> 25:12.000
The wound appears circular.

25:12.034 --> 25:13.586
About an inch
in diameter.

25:13.620 --> 25:14.344
A pipe?

25:14.379 --> 25:15.689
I'm not sure.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.793
So this makes
it murder.

25:17.827 --> 25:18.965
<i>Well what I have-</i>

25:19.000 --> 25:20.482
wouldn't hold up
in court, but-

25:20.517 --> 25:22.655
<i>I'd say so, yes.</i>

25:23.413 --> 25:25.275
If I were to speculate.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.137
Good work.

25:32.413 --> 25:33.448
<i>Come on, partner.</i>

25:36.206 --> 25:37.206
<i>Come on, pal.</i>

25:59.310 --> 26:00.241
Hey.

26:00.275 --> 26:01.241
<i>I'm heading
to the scene.</i>

26:01.275 --> 26:02.827
<i>Why?</i>

26:02.862 --> 26:04.034
We found a wound
on Serena Jones.

26:04.068 --> 26:04.827
And I can't explain.

26:04.862 --> 26:05.965
So we're just
going to go back-

26:06.000 --> 26:07.034
to see if we
missed anything.

26:07.068 --> 26:09.620
<i>You want me to
send Rex with you?</i>

26:10.413 --> 26:11.586
If we don't
find anything.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.275
Yeah, sure.

26:12.310 --> 26:14.344
<i>But for now-</i>

26:15.344 --> 26:16.413
Uh-

26:16.448 --> 26:18.551
I'd say locating Derek is
our number one priority.

26:25.448 --> 26:26.413
Yeah, we're on it.

26:27.068 --> 26:28.206
What have
you got, pal?

26:30.827 --> 26:31.586
Good thinking.

26:34.103 --> 26:34.827
Get the scent, pal.

26:36.862 --> 26:37.827
Track it.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.000
Let's go.

26:53.034 --> 26:53.724
They're on to something.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.275
You're not going
ahead with charges.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.275
No, not at
this time.

26:59.310 --> 27:01.413
Those two tried to burn
the man's house down.

27:01.448 --> 27:02.103
If you're worried-

27:02.137 --> 27:03.103
you can keep
eyes on them.

27:03.137 --> 27:04.724
But this is a
volatile situation.

27:04.758 --> 27:06.103
And I'm not going
to fan the flames.

27:07.206 --> 27:08.413
Pardon the metaphor.

27:09.448 --> 27:11.344
You're not trying to make
us look bad, are you?

27:11.379 --> 27:12.931
I'm just trying to
keep a lid on things.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.448
Well, we've found evidence-

27:15.482 --> 27:17.896
that suggests Serena might have
been a victim of foul play.

27:17.931 --> 27:19.931
All the more reason not to lay
charges against her friends.

27:21.103 --> 27:22.655
I know how
this looks.

27:22.758 --> 27:23.931
A couple goes off
into the woods.

27:23.965 --> 27:25.482
Only one of them
comes out.

27:25.517 --> 27:26.689
99 percent of
the world thinks-

27:26.724 --> 27:28.793
the one that came out
got rid of the other.

27:28.827 --> 27:30.896
Yeah, and 99 percent of
the time, they'd be right.

27:30.931 --> 27:33.275
Those still aren't
good enough odds.

27:34.448 --> 27:35.379
Hey hey, Michael.

27:35.965 --> 27:37.551
I hope this
isn't personal.

27:38.379 --> 27:39.689
Give me some credit.

27:43.206 --> 27:44.413
Okay, so-

27:44.448 --> 27:45.482
what do we do?

27:45.517 --> 27:47.172
Find a way to put
Derek Spade behind bars.

27:47.206 --> 27:47.896
I might have one.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.517
I'm listening.

27:49.551 --> 27:51.517
Serena Jones might have been
struck with a blunt instrument-

27:51.551 --> 27:52.241
before she died.

27:52.275 --> 27:53.103
A blunt instrument?

27:53.137 --> 27:54.551
I'm taking a team
to go find it now.

27:54.586 --> 27:55.448
Okay, keep me posted.

27:55.482 --> 27:56.206
<i>Okay.</i>

27:56.241 --> 27:57.379
Jesse, what have
you got for me?

27:57.413 --> 27:58.034
<i>Well-</i>

27:58.068 --> 27:59.103
Trey lied to us.

27:59.137 --> 28:00.758
Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

28:00.793 --> 28:01.931
In his preliminary interview-

28:01.965 --> 28:03.517
he said he was at
Dewars down on George-

28:03.551 --> 28:04.724
the night that Serena
Jones went missing.

28:04.758 --> 28:05.620
And?

28:05.655 --> 28:07.310
I talked to everybody
at Dewars, okay?

28:07.344 --> 28:08.206
He was a
regular there.

28:08.241 --> 28:10.137
<i>But wasn't there
that night.</i>

28:10.172 --> 28:10.793
You sure?

28:10.827 --> 28:11.620
Yeah.

28:11.655 --> 28:12.965
He had a hundred
dollar tab owing.

28:13.000 --> 28:13.655
Harry-

28:13.689 --> 28:14.655
the guy who
owns the place-

28:14.689 --> 28:15.551
was keeping
an eye out.

28:15.586 --> 28:16.620
If Trey were
to show up-

28:16.655 --> 28:17.689
Harry would have known.

28:18.551 --> 28:20.034
So why
would he lie?

28:20.068 --> 28:22.310
Maybe he was somewhere he
didn't want us to know about.

28:22.344 --> 28:23.344
Jesse, Jesse.

28:23.448 --> 28:24.275
It's a rhetorical question.

28:24.379 --> 28:25.310
Okay?

28:46.896 --> 28:48.206
<i>You got something?</i>

28:52.068 --> 28:52.724
Come on.

29:08.620 --> 29:09.793
Thank you.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.000
What are you
doing here?

29:13.034 --> 29:14.931
<i>I just have
a couple of questions.</i>

29:15.620 --> 29:17.103
I already told
you what I know.

29:17.137 --> 29:18.724
Yeah, the problem,
Trey, is you lied.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.379
Oh yeah?

29:19.413 --> 29:20.068
About what?

29:21.068 --> 29:22.448
You said you were at
Dewars on George Street-

29:22.482 --> 29:23.827
the night that
Serena went missing.

29:23.862 --> 29:24.586
Yeah?

29:25.241 --> 29:26.620
No one saw
you there.

29:27.413 --> 29:28.310
Why is that?

29:29.413 --> 29:30.379
Well-

29:31.310 --> 29:32.551
I-

29:33.206 --> 29:33.896
Ohhh!

29:34.724 --> 29:35.413
<i>Hey!</i>

29:36.931 --> 29:38.103
Hey!

29:42.931 --> 29:43.827
<i>Hey!</i>

29:49.517 --> 29:50.172
Hey!

29:51.241 --> 29:52.275
Hey!

29:54.241 --> 29:54.931
Stop!

29:59.068 --> 30:00.000
<i>Aghh!</i>

30:01.068 --> 30:01.862
<i>Damn it!</i>

30:02.310 --> 30:03.241
Hey.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.206
Why did you
make me run?

30:05.758 --> 30:06.379
Your choice.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.068
Not mine.

30:07.103 --> 30:07.724
Yeah?

30:07.758 --> 30:08.965
Okay, well-

30:09.000 --> 30:10.862
it gives us a chance to have a
more fulsome conversation.

30:11.275 --> 30:11.931
<i>Come on.</i>

30:12.448 --> 30:13.275
<i>Let's go.</i>

30:43.896 --> 30:45.000
Why are you stopping?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.965
Maybe we should let
the cops handle it.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.206
The cops haven't
handled it so far.

30:49.241 --> 30:50.068
Have they?

30:52.206 --> 30:53.413
You go.

30:53.517 --> 30:54.344
Adele!

30:55.344 --> 30:57.172
Just go!

30:59.379 --> 31:01.586
I'm going to make sure
that this is handled right!

31:48.275 --> 31:49.241
Sarah.

31:49.344 --> 31:50.275
Look what I found.

31:51.517 --> 31:52.862
<i>What is that
doing out here?</i>

31:52.896 --> 31:53.896
I don't know.

31:53.931 --> 31:56.068
Someone maybe used it
to hammer in tent pegs?

31:59.413 --> 32:00.586
<i>That explain the blood?</i>

32:00.620 --> 32:02.793
Well I mean you really didn't
give me a chance to fully-

32:06.034 --> 32:07.068
Derek's prints.

32:07.793 --> 32:08.551
Well that seals it.

32:08.586 --> 32:09.310
Maybe.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.000
<i>Maybe not.</i>

32:10.965 --> 32:11.827
<i>There's someone
else's prints on this.</i>

32:14.724 --> 32:15.965
<i>Karen.</i>

32:16.000 --> 32:17.827
<i>If you find anything else,
bring it to my lab.</i>

32:23.379 --> 32:24.172
Hey Joe.

32:24.206 --> 32:25.586
<i>We got something.</i>

32:25.827 --> 32:27.034
<i>Looks to be the
murder weapon.</i>

32:27.137 --> 32:28.034
Good job.

32:28.068 --> 32:28.931
<i>Derek's prints
are on it.</i>

32:28.965 --> 32:30.241
<i>But so were
someone else's.</i>

32:30.344 --> 32:33.034
<i>Did we prints from Trey and
Jessika when we brought them in?</i>

32:33.068 --> 32:34.068
No, no no.

32:34.103 --> 32:34.896
<i>They were just brought
in for questioning.</i>

32:34.931 --> 32:36.034
<i>Then we released them.</i>

32:38.068 --> 32:40.344
Okay, I'm going to see if I can
get them to provide them.

32:40.379 --> 32:41.896
<i>I'm here with Trey.</i>

32:41.931 --> 32:43.551
<i>I'll see if I can
get him to volunteer.</i>

32:43.586 --> 32:44.931
<i>What are you
thinking Sarah?</i>

32:44.965 --> 32:46.241
Just covering the bases.

32:46.275 --> 32:47.758
Just keep me posted.

32:49.172 --> 32:49.793
<i>So.</i>

32:49.827 --> 32:51.068
You finished with me?

32:51.310 --> 32:52.172
<i>Oh no, my friend.</i>

32:52.206 --> 32:52.931
<i>We're not even close.</i>

32:52.965 --> 32:53.689
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

32:57.517 --> 32:58.551
You can't do that.

32:58.586 --> 32:59.482
You need a warrant.

32:59.517 --> 33:00.344
<i>Well that's where
you're wrong.</i>

33:00.379 --> 33:01.448
<i>You ran from a
police officer-</i>

33:01.482 --> 33:04.620
which gives me
probable cause-

33:04.655 --> 33:06.344
to believe that you've
committed an infraction.

33:08.379 --> 33:09.241
<i>Well that's interesting.</i>

33:09.275 --> 33:10.655
Maybe this was
what you were up to-

33:10.689 --> 33:12.517
the night you said you were
supposed to be at Dewars.

33:12.551 --> 33:13.724
Maybe it was.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.551
<i>But if that's the
case, it also means-</i>

33:15.586 --> 33:17.724
I wasn't anywhere near
where Serena was killed.

33:18.482 --> 33:19.379
Okay.

33:20.413 --> 33:22.586
So all we have to do is
track down your dealer-

33:22.620 --> 33:24.137
<i>and verify that.</i>

33:25.103 --> 33:26.655
<i>You think that's
going to be easy Trey?</i>

33:27.862 --> 33:28.862
That's what I thought.

33:32.862 --> 33:33.793
<i>Hold on.</i>

33:34.310 --> 33:35.689
<i>What do we
have here?</i>

33:38.103 --> 33:40.344
That's Jessika and Derek.

33:42.137 --> 33:43.379
Yeah, I
can see that.

33:44.241 --> 33:45.344
What's the story?

34:03.206 --> 34:04.655
Step back from there.

34:05.068 --> 34:06.000
Why would I?

34:07.172 --> 34:08.517
A lot of problems
go away-

34:08.551 --> 34:09.965
if I take one
step forward.

34:11.034 --> 34:12.000
Don't do that.

34:12.827 --> 34:13.689
Why not?

34:15.206 --> 34:16.586
Are you saying
you did it?

34:19.172 --> 34:20.310
Might as well have.

34:20.344 --> 34:23.137
<i>Everyone thinks I did.</i>

34:23.827 --> 34:24.896
Whether I
did it or not-

34:24.931 --> 34:26.206
my life is over!

34:26.310 --> 34:28.000
Do you think
I'm guilty?

34:30.137 --> 34:31.344
I don't know.

34:33.310 --> 34:34.413
You telling the truth?

34:34.448 --> 34:35.655
Look.

34:35.689 --> 34:36.827
All I know is
my only job-

34:36.862 --> 34:38.448
and Rex's only job-

34:38.482 --> 34:39.344
is to protect you.

34:39.379 --> 34:40.206
So come on!

34:40.241 --> 34:41.655
Yeah, well maybe
you're going to fail.

34:43.413 --> 34:44.931
<i>I do know that
if you are innocent-</i>

34:44.965 --> 34:46.344
<i>I'll fight
for you!</i>

34:57.965 --> 34:59.413
<i>You have my word.</i>

35:04.862 --> 35:06.206
I didn't kill her.

35:06.379 --> 35:07.655
I loved her!

35:18.551 --> 35:20.000
Then let me
help you.

35:21.689 --> 35:23.034
Come on.

35:24.137 --> 35:25.517
<i>He doesn't
deserve your help.</i>

35:26.827 --> 35:28.655
He killed my sister!

35:40.068 --> 35:40.931
<i>Come on in.</i>

35:41.724 --> 35:42.655
<i>Hey Jessika.</i>

35:43.344 --> 35:44.241
Thank you.

35:58.517 --> 36:00.034
<i>The best thing
you can do right now-</i>

36:00.068 --> 36:01.344
is turn around
and go home.

36:01.379 --> 36:04.034
You do that, I'll
forget about the gun.

36:04.068 --> 36:05.413
That's not happening.

36:05.448 --> 36:07.448
<i>Then I'm going to have
no choice but to charge you.</i>

36:07.482 --> 36:09.206
Adele.

36:09.241 --> 36:10.103
<i>I didn't kill
your sister.</i>

36:10.137 --> 36:11.586
<i>You shut up!</i>

36:12.620 --> 36:13.724
Adele.

36:14.620 --> 36:17.137
I have this
under control.

36:17.172 --> 36:18.551
You don't have anything
under control!

36:18.655 --> 36:19.965
<i>You'll be
behind bars.</i>

36:20.000 --> 36:21.758
I don't care.

36:21.793 --> 36:24.620
<i>As long as he leaves
this earth before I do-</i>

36:24.655 --> 36:26.103
<i>I don't care!</i>

36:26.137 --> 36:27.689
We don't know for sure
that he killed her.

36:27.724 --> 36:28.965
<i>I know
he killed her!</i>

36:29.000 --> 36:30.620
I know she was
going to leave him.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.241
<i>She told me
she was!</i>

36:32.275 --> 36:33.034
<i>So he killed her!</i>

36:33.068 --> 36:33.896
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

36:37.172 --> 36:40.206
I said isn't
that right?

36:42.931 --> 36:45.000
So you're saying you
want my fingerprints?

36:45.034 --> 36:46.000
<i>Yeah, that's all.</i>

36:46.275 --> 36:47.241
<i>Why?</i>

36:47.275 --> 36:48.758
It's just routine.

36:50.241 --> 36:51.241
I told you.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.620
There wasn't enough
gas to cause any trouble.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.689
Oh, we're not
charging you-

36:54.724 --> 36:56.689
with anything
related to that.

36:56.724 --> 36:57.517
Oh yeah?

36:57.551 --> 36:59.448
So why do you want
my fingerprints?

37:03.241 --> 37:04.965
I didn't kill Serena!

37:05.000 --> 37:06.137
Enough lies, Derek!

37:08.482 --> 37:09.310
<i>Y'know,
enough of this.</i>

37:09.344 --> 37:10.344
You do whatever
you want!

37:10.379 --> 37:11.827
You're not walking
away from this!

37:13.793 --> 37:14.517
Don't.

37:16.551 --> 37:18.310
Please don't!

37:19.413 --> 37:21.965
You wanted to be all dramatic
and throw yourself off a cliff.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.275
Now's your chance!

37:25.241 --> 37:27.448
Send units to the house
of Jessika Warren.

37:27.482 --> 37:29.034
44 Bounty Road.

37:29.068 --> 37:30.310
<i>On their way.</i>

37:30.344 --> 37:32.103
<i>Jesse, make sure that Sarah
gets out of there right now.</i>

37:32.137 --> 37:34.448
Jessika Warren is now
our primary suspect.

37:34.482 --> 37:35.344
Okay okay.

37:40.379 --> 37:41.793
Come on, Sarah.

37:46.931 --> 37:47.965
Oh.

37:48.000 --> 37:48.655
<i>Put the phone down.</i>

37:48.689 --> 37:49.965
<i>And step
away from it.</i>

37:50.000 --> 37:50.655
Okay.

37:53.551 --> 37:54.482
What are you doing?

37:54.517 --> 37:55.482
What I have to.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.758
You better move,
Detective Hudson!

37:59.793 --> 38:01.655
I can't do that.

38:03.241 --> 38:06.000
He killed my
little sister.

38:12.655 --> 38:13.344
<i>Uhh!</i>

38:13.724 --> 38:14.758
<i>Ughh!</i>

38:18.310 --> 38:19.655
<i>I got you!</i>

38:38.620 --> 38:40.379
<i>Good job, Rex!</i>

38:42.310 --> 38:45.000
Okay don't do
anything stupid here.

38:45.034 --> 38:46.724
That's a good one.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.862
<i>Seems to me-</i>

38:47.896 --> 38:49.413
like I already have.

38:49.448 --> 38:51.344
I killed my
best friend.

38:54.344 --> 38:56.620
Well then don't
make it worse.

38:56.655 --> 38:58.482
Hey it couldn't
be worse.

38:59.896 --> 39:01.758
I didn't mean
to, you know.

39:05.103 --> 39:06.965
She stole
Derek from me.

39:08.689 --> 39:10.241
She didn't even care.

39:10.275 --> 39:11.862
I went to talk
to her about it.

39:11.896 --> 39:17.137
She said there are winners
and losers in this world.

39:17.172 --> 39:18.793
<i>We fought.</i>

39:18.827 --> 39:23.000
<i>And then the hammer
was in my hand.</i>

39:23.034 --> 39:23.655
<i>I hit her.</i>

39:31.689 --> 39:32.931
She didn't get up.

39:34.103 --> 39:35.310
I knew what I
did was wrong.

39:35.344 --> 39:37.241
But it was done.

39:41.827 --> 39:43.206
So what are you
going to do now?

39:45.172 --> 39:46.241
It doesn't matter.

39:50.137 --> 39:54.275
Well it sounds to me like
this was all an accident.

39:55.793 --> 39:58.137
I killed my
best friend.

39:58.172 --> 39:58.896
I have to go.

39:58.931 --> 40:00.034
<i>Jessika.</i>

40:00.068 --> 40:01.000
They'll shut down the
airports, close the ferries.

40:02.137 --> 40:03.482
I'll find somewhere.

40:03.517 --> 40:04.241
And don't follow me.

40:05.758 --> 40:06.551
<i>Uhh!</i>

40:06.931 --> 40:08.206
Ughh!

40:10.827 --> 40:11.620
Need a hand?

40:11.655 --> 40:12.862
I think I've got
it under control.

40:14.000 --> 40:14.896
Jessika Warren.

40:16.034 --> 40:19.137
You are under arrest for
the murder for Serena Jones.

40:24.275 --> 40:25.137
You're good?

40:25.896 --> 40:26.724
Yeah, I'm good.

40:28.206 --> 40:29.206
You should bring
backup next time.

40:29.241 --> 40:29.931
Of course.

40:29.965 --> 40:31.413
I'm just saying
this because-

40:32.896 --> 40:34.000
because I care
about you.

40:35.172 --> 40:37.586
I mean, I can
handle myself, Joe.

40:38.551 --> 40:39.620
I appreciate the
concern though.

40:39.655 --> 40:40.551
Thank you.

40:42.620 --> 40:43.551
Miss Jones?

40:45.551 --> 40:46.689
I just wanted
to say-

40:48.000 --> 40:49.862
thank you.

40:49.896 --> 40:51.586
And I'm sorry.

40:52.379 --> 40:53.344
And I'm sorry-

40:54.379 --> 40:55.413
about your sister.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.551
So you're going
to stay here?

41:09.586 --> 41:10.413
See?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.034
Today's outrageous-

41:12.068 --> 41:13.241
tomorrow's distant memory.

41:13.275 --> 41:14.482
Right?

41:14.517 --> 41:16.793
<i>At least sometimes.</i>

41:16.827 --> 41:18.551
<i>Yeah, let's hope
it plays out that way.</i>

41:21.724 --> 41:22.517
<i>You know-</i>

41:22.551 --> 41:23.551
<i>if you wanted
one of your own-</i>

41:23.586 --> 41:24.724
<i>I could arrange that.</i>

41:26.413 --> 41:27.068
<i>Yeah!</i>

41:27.103 --> 41:29.034
Maybe I would
like that.

41:29.068 --> 41:30.896
Maybe that
would be good.

41:32.896 --> 41:36.172
Well, from my
personal experience-

41:36.206 --> 41:37.689
there's no
maybe about it.

41:59.068 --> 42:01.448
I can't believe you're putting
that thing back on the road.

42:01.482 --> 42:02.482
<i>What can I say?</i>

42:02.517 --> 42:03.586
<i>Rex missed it.</i>

42:03.620 --> 42:04.620
Just Rex?

42:08.655 --> 42:10.310
<i>He do his thing?</i>

42:10.344 --> 42:11.034
<i>Took a while.</i>

42:11.068 --> 42:13.000
But mission accomplished.

42:14.827 --> 42:15.689
You know-

42:17.000 --> 42:18.827
he's starting to like
me better than you.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.068
Oh.

42:20.103 --> 42:21.172
Don't get cocky now.

42:21.482 --> 42:22.620
Rex is this true?

42:22.655 --> 42:23.896
<i>You like her
better than me?</i>

42:28.413 --> 42:30.103
I think you've still got
a ways to go, Doctor.

42:30.827 --> 42:31.931
You coming in?

42:33.241 --> 42:34.482
