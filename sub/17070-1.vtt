00:23.210 --> 00:25.805
Step away from the curb, children.

00:41.398 --> 00:45.267
Hi, Sister!
You look terrific today!

00:45.470 --> 00:48.598
- What have you done with your hair?
- You're late again, Rick.

00:48.740 --> 00:53.041
- I know. But I have a very good excuse.
- There can be no excuse for tardiness.

00:53.479 --> 00:55.913
You're right. You're
absolutely right.

00:56.081 --> 00:59.449
I should never have stopped and
saved that drowning infant.

00:59.619 --> 01:01.951
I'm weak, Sister! I'm just so weak!

01:02.088 --> 01:04.215
All right, now. Stop that.

01:04.358 --> 01:06.588
Children, on the bus.

01:06.761 --> 01:11.859
Sister, if you ever get lonely after
vespers, I'm the man to call.

01:11.967 --> 01:13.696
My number's in the book.

01:13.902 --> 01:17.236
Get going, Rick.
You're late enough as it is.

01:17.373 --> 01:19.034
Think about it, OK?

01:19.242 --> 01:21.676
OK, come along, children!

01:28.552 --> 01:29.883
Attention, passengers.

01:30.088 --> 01:35.219
We are now leaving Nun Central on
our journey to hell and beyond.

01:35.327 --> 01:37.853
The captain has turned
off the No Smoking sign.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.760
You may now move about
the cabin freely.

01:44.504 --> 01:49.669
Thank you for being Catholic, and for
choosing the St Gabriel school bus.

02:12.336 --> 02:16.466
Now don't forget, Garcia. Ten
percent of that goes to the house.

02:17.376 --> 02:19.105
Ahh, youth!

02:24.317 --> 02:29.414
You'll love these shots. Thank you very
much, Mrs Reeves. Have a nice day.

02:30.157 --> 02:31.317
Next!

02:39.601 --> 02:42.627
Ho-ho-ho! Look at those babies!

02:43.004 --> 02:46.532
Adorable. Come on, let's get
started. Are we married?

02:46.742 --> 02:48.903
<i>- I'm separated.
- Then there is a God.</i>

02:49.345 --> 02:52.509
Let's try something a little special.
Try these on, Timmy.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.245
Ooh, yeah. Chic in the sun, yeah.

02:57.055 --> 02:59.182
Take that drink right there.

02:59.424 --> 03:01.949
Yeah, that looks like fun, hm?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.425
To me, this is an incredible shot.

03:04.697 --> 03:08.098
OK, I can see you're not impressed.
And you're right. I hate it too.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.225
Your kid is more hip,
more now, more '80s.

03:11.438 --> 03:13.770
Let's try this right here.
Now get ready.

03:14.007 --> 03:17.034
Hold on. I'm crazy about this one.
Your own baby Jedi.

03:17.144 --> 03:20.705
This is terrific. You're gonna
like this. Huh? Huh? Huh?

03:22.316 --> 03:25.445
All right, you're not
into science fiction. OK.

03:25.587 --> 03:29.318
Oh! Mrs Klupner, why
didn't I see this before?

03:29.524 --> 03:32.392
Why don't you lean into the
picture with your child?

03:32.628 --> 03:34.653
Oh, yes, yes.

03:36.265 --> 03:38.063
Yes, yes, yes.

03:38.268 --> 03:39.997
Lean in a little more.

03:40.237 --> 03:43.730
If I was that kid, I would
breast-feed until I was 17 or 18.

03:43.908 --> 03:46.741
OK. Now hold that
pose, Mrs Klupner.

03:53.753 --> 03:57.986
Timmy, why don't you go to sleep?
There we go. Good boy. There we go.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.032
Raul!

04:37.270 --> 04:40.330
Who the hell put this
shit in my beer cooler?!

04:40.773 --> 04:42.832
Jesus Christ!

04:43.075 --> 04:44.839
Stupid people!

04:45.112 --> 04:47.137
I gotta change the oil.

04:49.483 --> 04:50.246
Hey!

04:50.485 --> 04:53.545
Rudy! Here, boy! Hey, Rudy!

04:53.688 --> 04:56.452
Oh, shit! I don't believe this!

04:57.359 --> 05:00.658
Guys, this is the problem
with American cars!

05:01.931 --> 05:06.062
Help me put this crap together
and we'll get outta here.

05:09.139 --> 05:13.543
The Police concert's sold out?
My customers are gonna kill me!

05:14.045 --> 05:15.774
Screw that!

05:15.980 --> 05:17.710
Screw Sting!

05:17.916 --> 05:20.714
- Hi, guys. How's it goin'?
- How are you, you animal?

05:20.953 --> 05:23.286
Great. I'm a dead man.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.482
Hello. Concert Tickets.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.251
What?

05:28.428 --> 05:31.421
You're kiddin'! Boy George
has a yeast infection?!

05:31.565 --> 05:34.591
He's canceling?! You know
what this is gonna cost me?!

05:34.735 --> 05:37.796
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't call me again, OK?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.801
Let's get outta here.

05:40.976 --> 05:44.811
I told you not to call me again!
You're full of shit! Eat my...

05:45.014 --> 05:48.313
Oh, hi, Mom. No, no, no.
I didn't know it was you.

05:48.451 --> 05:50.249
Right. Eggs and milk.

05:50.454 --> 05:53.082
Ma... Ma, I'll talk to you later.

05:54.091 --> 05:57.357
- This better be important.
- This guy gets along with everybody.

05:57.495 --> 05:58.985
Oh, yeah. A real diplomat.

06:00.398 --> 06:02.423
Eat me.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.161
I love it when he talks like that!

06:05.504 --> 06:09.770
- We'd like to order now.
- Hey, no sweat. No sweat, guys.

06:09.909 --> 06:11.571
You wanna order?

06:11.778 --> 06:14.212
Here's today's deals. OK?

06:15.315 --> 06:17.375
OK, we got veal.

06:17.718 --> 06:20.152
We got veal... Par...

06:22.256 --> 06:24.122
Veal... Par...

06:24.326 --> 06:26.191
What's this word?

06:26.428 --> 06:27.452
Parmesan.

06:27.596 --> 06:31.089
That's that meat with that cheese
on it. See, I don't eat cheese.

06:31.301 --> 06:33.565
Gives me mucus.
Clogs me up with phlegm.

06:33.703 --> 06:37.834
And butter, that's another thing.
Clogs you up with snot.

06:37.942 --> 06:39.500
Please, we're in a hurry.

06:39.843 --> 06:41.572
Ryko, come on, take a break!

06:43.448 --> 06:45.678
Hey, be right there, guys.

06:45.850 --> 06:49.981
Hey, keep your slimy paws out of my
food, man. Order your own food.

06:50.156 --> 06:51.714
I hope you choke, you animal.

06:52.158 --> 06:54.023
Hey!

06:56.228 --> 06:57.628
Get outta here.

06:57.764 --> 07:02.463
All right, OK, now we're all here.
So what's the big announcement?

07:03.471 --> 07:07.999
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna beat
around the bush on this thing.

07:08.176 --> 07:10.873
We've known each other
since grade school,

07:11.080 --> 07:13.605
so I'm gonna give this to
ya right from the hip.

07:13.782 --> 07:17.184
I mean, it's gonna come
straight from the old shoulder.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.822
I mean, no fancy
stuff or anything...

07:19.990 --> 07:20.786
Come on, Rick!

07:20.991 --> 07:25.088
All right. OK. All right,
all right, all right. This is it.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.129
- I'm gettin' married.
- Yeah, right, yeah.

07:37.777 --> 07:40.507
That was not a joke, guys!

07:41.681 --> 07:48.417
A week from this Saturday, I turn in
my amateur standing and I... I go pro.

07:49.123 --> 07:50.853
- I don't believe it.
- Come on!

07:51.593 --> 07:53.356
Fuck me!

07:53.561 --> 07:55.654
Well, thanks for tellin' us, man.

08:03.205 --> 08:04.696
Guys!

08:05.175 --> 08:06.301
Guys!

08:08.745 --> 08:10.771
Guys!

08:12.850 --> 08:14.647
Our buddy is gettin' married.

08:14.886 --> 08:19.551
This is the happiest moment of his life
and you guys are giving him a hard time.

08:19.758 --> 08:23.627
You guys should be ashamed of
yourselves. Congratulations, buddy.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.561
Come on, guys!

08:28.735 --> 08:33.866
Look, Rick, I'd rather be dead. But if
this is what you want, good luck, man.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.768
All the best. It should
happen to me, man.

08:39.648 --> 08:42.014
Since you're gonna do this...

08:42.183 --> 08:44.312
- You really are gonna do this?
- Yeah.

08:44.454 --> 08:46.752
At least we can make sure
you go out in style.

08:46.889 --> 08:50.951
Let's have a bachelor party, with
chicks and guns and fire trucks

08:51.061 --> 08:52.892
and hookers and drugs and booze...

08:53.130 --> 08:57.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All the things
that make life worth living for!

08:58.203 --> 09:00.228
Speech! Speech!

09:01.106 --> 09:03.165
All right, all right.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.839
I want you to know
that this marriage

09:07.012 --> 09:12.041
is not in any way gonna jeopardize my
relationship with my pals, damn it.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.915
We're still gonna go bowling
every Tuesday night.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.523
Still gonna play cards
every Friday night.

09:17.692 --> 09:21.321
And wear each other's underwear every
Sunday. Nothing is gonna change!

09:21.529 --> 09:24.090
I love you guys and I always will.

09:24.633 --> 09:28.000
- Hey, a toast!
- To Rick and Debbie.

09:29.138 --> 09:31.198
To us.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.067
To girls with big tits.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.908
Good point! Good point! Good point.

10:04.445 --> 10:06.436
- Excuse me...
- What?

10:06.581 --> 10:09.880
- I'd like to pay for this.
- Could you wait till the song is over?

10:10.052 --> 10:11.610
Oh, sure. No problem.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.885
Excuse me.

10:19.596 --> 10:23.727
- Where can I try on these pants?
- Right over there. Can I take these for you?

10:23.901 --> 10:29.237
You'll really like these. I have a couple
of pairs myself. They fit very nice.

10:41.888 --> 10:43.618
Phoebe?

10:45.526 --> 10:50.021
I don't think your brother did such a good
job of fixing the dressing-room doors.

10:50.198 --> 10:53.326
What do you mean? They look great!

10:53.835 --> 10:56.463
- You don't see a problem here?
- Not really.

10:56.706 --> 10:58.503
No? Maybe it's just me.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.007
Debbie, I don't believe you!

11:06.183 --> 11:08.879
I am your friend and you
don't even tell me!

11:09.052 --> 11:11.283
Bobbi, what is going on?

11:11.456 --> 11:14.948
I just heard from O'Neill.
Oh, God, I'm so excited!

11:15.126 --> 11:17.493
- What's happening?
- Debbie's marrying Rick!

11:17.630 --> 11:18.995
- Really?
- Really.

11:19.164 --> 11:21.189
Oh, my gosh!

11:22.001 --> 11:25.096
Oh, my gosh! You're
actually marrying Rick!

11:25.939 --> 11:30.309
- Wait a minute. Does Cole know about this?
- You went with him for two years!

11:30.444 --> 11:32.776
No. And he won't leave me alone.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.913
And your parents can't be
too thrilled about this.

11:36.150 --> 11:40.679
No, as far as they're concerned,
the only good Rick is a dead Rick.

11:41.189 --> 11:44.250
But I've made my decision,
and we're gonna do it.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.887
I don't believe it!
Mrs Rick Gassko!

11:48.064 --> 11:49.691
You're getting married...

11:49.866 --> 11:53.997
Seems like only yesterday I
showed ya how to give a blow job.

11:57.309 --> 12:02.144
I'll give you a
different kind of high

12:02.514 --> 12:06.918
No, I'm not like the
rest of the boys

12:07.453 --> 12:10.912
I'm from Decatur, Illinois

12:12.125 --> 12:16.562
And I am suave, debonair

12:17.098 --> 12:20.898
I got this boss,
curly dark black hair

12:21.703 --> 12:26.334
And I like how you run... baby!

12:27.309 --> 12:30.438
Because you never say maybe

12:31.114 --> 12:33.173
I like you...

12:33.483 --> 12:35.041
Oh, shit!

12:39.490 --> 12:45.521
Well, hey, the meal is just about
ready, so it's time for spice...

12:45.664 --> 12:49.532
Yes, it's spice time,
and the lucky spice is...

12:49.735 --> 12:51.397
Paprika!

12:51.604 --> 12:56.439
Thank you, thank you, thank you! You've
made me the happiest spice in the world!

12:56.642 --> 13:00.739
It's a veritable UN for dinner
here, so Swedish meatballs!

13:04.519 --> 13:06.544
Ah! Vino!

13:06.688 --> 13:09.748
A little vino... would be keeno!

13:10.192 --> 13:12.251
I want some wine!

13:12.728 --> 13:14.161
Now...

13:14.330 --> 13:18.665
What meal would be complete
without a little dead meat?

13:18.802 --> 13:22.533
Yes, America's favorite food:
Dead animal flesh.

13:23.306 --> 13:29.041
All the burners are occupied at this time,
so I'm just gonna have to improvise here.

13:31.016 --> 13:33.075
- Hi, babe!
- Hi!

13:39.225 --> 13:43.856
- What are you doing?
- Just welding up a little dinner, that's all.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.725
It's you!

13:53.942 --> 13:56.342
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

13:59.415 --> 14:02.248
- God, you're a slob!
- Yeah, but I'm a fabulous cook.

14:02.452 --> 14:05.149
Yeah? And what are we having?

14:05.355 --> 14:09.724
Well, it's either Swiss steak, meat loaf...
I dunno. Charred flesh of some sort.

14:09.860 --> 14:13.160
<i>- Why don't we name it after we eat?
- Good idea.</i>

14:14.833 --> 14:17.564
Mr Chef? Your
vegetables are on fire.

14:18.404 --> 14:23.741
Oh! Hey! It's OK. It's all right. It's
broccoli flambé. It's supposed to do that.

14:23.877 --> 14:29.975
Just a little tricky, that's all. Guess I put
in a little too much nuclear waste, huh?

14:30.952 --> 14:33.284
- Wanna hear something great?
- You betcha.

14:33.421 --> 14:36.949
Bobbi and Phoebe are gonna throw me
a shower. It's gonna be so much fun!

14:37.192 --> 14:41.629
Not as much fun as the bachelor party
the guys are gonna throw for me.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.529
I hope you like potato salad.
It's chunky style, my favorite.

14:45.702 --> 14:48.796
- You're gonna have a bachelor party?
- Sure! You bet!

14:48.905 --> 14:53.240
Hey, it's a traditional event,
and I am a traditional kinda guy.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.510
How about this? Does
this look great or what?

14:58.650 --> 15:02.450
- It looks awful.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.788
Not in this case, however.

15:09.061 --> 15:13.192
Nope, this is definitely the food
that prison riots are made of.

15:14.001 --> 15:16.800
Are we gonna have
girls at our party?

15:18.306 --> 15:20.365
Well...

15:21.543 --> 15:26.675
No, it's a stag party, and that
means that does stay home.

15:27.883 --> 15:32.082
I'm not talking about does.
I'm talking about hookers.

15:32.255 --> 15:34.746
Ohhh! Those!

15:35.926 --> 15:37.554
What do you mean?

15:37.728 --> 15:43.098
I mean, like, from what I hear, it's a
tradition. And you're a traditional guy.

15:44.436 --> 15:48.532
Come here, you little vixen. I'm gonna
set you straight about something.

15:48.674 --> 15:52.202
Women mean nothing to me, and that
is why I am so in love with you.

15:54.547 --> 15:57.142
Do you understand what I'm saying?

15:58.752 --> 16:01.186
I need you to promise me.

16:02.790 --> 16:05.851
OK. OK. I promise. You got it.

16:11.734 --> 16:16.000
You know, I... I know a way
that we can seal this bargain.

16:16.907 --> 16:18.340
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

16:22.713 --> 16:24.443
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait!

16:24.616 --> 16:29.110
I got a surprise for ya! And I
think you're really gonna like it!

16:29.787 --> 16:32.655
Aw, come on, honey!
We'll take turns!

16:38.765 --> 16:41.859
OK, Ricky. Wanna hold out your arm?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.563
You wouldn't hurt your
own brother, would you?

16:44.739 --> 16:49.733
Hey! I've changed my mind! I don't need a
blood test. I'm not even gonna get married.

16:49.844 --> 16:54.282
- The wedding is off, chief.
- Bear. Chicken, chicken, chicken!

16:58.021 --> 17:02.549
You were always sneaky, Stan.
You were always very, very sneaky.

17:03.861 --> 17:05.589
Hey, you ready for this big party?

17:05.796 --> 17:10.530
I understand that the guys have some
fascinating women lined up for you.

17:10.769 --> 17:12.292
A bevy of...

17:16.040 --> 17:18.839
Keep your voice down. I've got
the wife in the other room.

17:19.045 --> 17:21.104
Uh, Stan...

17:22.815 --> 17:25.648
Stan, is this supposed
to be like this?

17:28.255 --> 17:29.950
No, that's incorrect.

17:30.158 --> 17:31.557
Oh.

17:33.394 --> 17:35.692
I can't understand
you getting married.

17:35.830 --> 17:39.358
Do you have any idea what you're
giving up? Any idea? An inkling?

17:39.568 --> 17:43.095
Everything! Wild parties.
Running around like a maniac.

17:43.305 --> 17:45.797
Women every night. Nakedness. Gone!

17:46.009 --> 17:48.000
I miss that so much, Ricky.

17:48.111 --> 17:50.444
Stan, you're beginning
to depress me.

17:50.614 --> 17:55.142
Oh, well, maybe you'll feel just
a little better after this.

17:55.386 --> 17:57.821
Easy. Easy. And hold.

17:58.423 --> 18:01.449
Oh, that's a fair trade.
A cotton ball for all my blood.

18:01.593 --> 18:04.154
OK, Ricky, all finished.

18:06.099 --> 18:09.364
Hey, I'm really looking forward
to this bachelor party.

18:09.535 --> 18:14.667
Whatever you do, you don't say
nothin' to Tina, OK? She'll kill me.

18:15.075 --> 18:17.271
- Who don't you say nothin' to?
- Tina?

18:17.445 --> 18:19.037
Tina. OK.

18:19.247 --> 18:22.478
Don't screw me up. I told her I'm
going to a plasma convention.

18:22.650 --> 18:25.176
Oh, well, that's brilliant.

18:25.421 --> 18:26.854
Hi, Tina!

18:27.857 --> 18:32.454
Rick! Mr Goldsmith, this is my
brother-in-law. He's getting married.

18:33.263 --> 18:34.821
Congratulations.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.232
Nurse, take over.

18:37.435 --> 18:39.835
I am so happy for you!

18:40.104 --> 18:42.231
That's great. I'm glad. Thanks.

18:42.440 --> 18:47.071
Listen, I gotta run. I gotta make
sure the guys have got the hookers!

18:48.247 --> 18:50.341
- Hookers?
- He didn't say hookers.

18:50.483 --> 18:53.475
- Did I say hookers? I didn't mean...
- You said hookers.

18:53.586 --> 18:56.419
He didn't say hookers.
I'm walking Ricky out.

18:57.091 --> 19:01.221
You had to open your mouth. You had to
say something. You had to say hookers!

19:01.328 --> 19:05.163
- Doc, I'll pay my bill! Don't hurt me, please!
- I'll kill you!

19:07.803 --> 19:10.932
I'll pull out your lights!
I'll rip out your guts!

19:11.073 --> 19:14.770
I'll break you in half! Now
shut up and get outta here!

19:14.944 --> 19:16.970
OK. All right.

19:17.314 --> 19:19.646
Oh, listen. I'll see ya
Saturday for the...?

19:19.783 --> 19:21.842
Out!

19:27.292 --> 19:29.726
Mrs Phillips. You're next.

19:43.043 --> 19:45.706
- OK, who serves?
- Your turn, Dad.

20:03.233 --> 20:06.362
It's long, it's to the fence,
it's to the wall! It's gone!

20:06.537 --> 20:07.765
- Rick!
- Yep.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.937
Hit the ball easier, son.
You don't have to kill it.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.073
Uh... maybe we should go in now.

20:14.246 --> 20:17.307
No. We will at least
finish this set.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.814
- Ready?
- Yo!

20:32.901 --> 20:35.028
Yes! Cleveland wins the pennant!

20:39.308 --> 20:44.508
One of these days, I'm gonna burn the
Thompson court right to the ground.

20:48.118 --> 20:53.455
I gotta admit my tennis is a little
rusty, but polo... There's a game, eh?

20:53.624 --> 20:56.752
Unrelenting, constant
challenge to the senses.

20:56.862 --> 20:59.262
A beautiful, manly experience.

20:59.431 --> 21:03.425
Rick, I want to cut through the BS.

21:04.837 --> 21:07.032
- I'd like that.
- Good.

21:07.707 --> 21:10.039
I think you're an asshole.

21:10.210 --> 21:13.737
No, let me correct that.
An immature asshole.

21:14.048 --> 21:17.610
Which is fine, except that
you're marrying my daughter

21:17.852 --> 21:21.845
and I'm afraid that my grandchildren
are gonna be little assholes.

21:21.923 --> 21:24.188
- Mr Thompson, I...
- No, let me finish.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.621
Debbie is an adult. She
can do what she wants.

21:28.431 --> 21:32.994
But if you want your marriage to last, you
have to change some things about yourself.

21:33.337 --> 21:37.001
- Now, if I may make some suggestions?
- Oh, feel free.

21:37.175 --> 21:39.837
Good. First, you're a slob.

21:40.044 --> 21:42.103
You dress like a bum.

21:42.246 --> 21:44.681
Second, you're unmotivated.

21:45.284 --> 21:48.720
You have no self-esteem,
no thought about the future.

21:49.121 --> 21:53.320
You're inconsiderate. You're
insensitive. You're insincere.

21:54.394 --> 21:58.729
I'm having the same caterer for your shower
that we had at our Christmas party last year.

21:58.899 --> 22:01.060
That'd be great! They're wonderful!

22:01.202 --> 22:06.072
If I were you, I'd worry less about the
shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.

22:06.308 --> 22:09.835
Why...? Why would I want
to do that? I trust Rick.

22:10.012 --> 22:14.109
Oh, of course you do. And I
trusted my ex, Kevin, too.

22:15.118 --> 22:17.781
Cousin, I can only speak
to you from experience.

22:17.955 --> 22:20.480
But what do you think happens
at bachelor parties?

22:20.891 --> 22:23.622
Think they drink tea
and play Scrabble?

22:23.828 --> 22:25.921
Ilene, I trust Rick. He promised...

22:26.031 --> 22:29.330
Debbie, please! Don't be naive.
Men are pigs.

22:30.503 --> 22:34.132
Girls, why don't we go
inside and have some lunch?

22:35.374 --> 22:38.208
Boys! Come on inside
and have lunch!

22:38.545 --> 22:40.570
In a second.

22:42.249 --> 22:45.515
And you're irresponsible.
A show-off.

22:45.820 --> 22:48.345
You're vulgar.
You're inappropriate.

22:48.823 --> 22:52.123
You're unrefined. You're obnoxious.

22:52.661 --> 22:57.793
Well, Mr Thompson, that's really quite a list.
And you're right. You're absolutely right.

22:57.934 --> 23:01.301
And I think,
if I really apply myself,

23:01.438 --> 23:05.967
I could be a totally changed person
by the time we finish lunch.

23:17.957 --> 23:20.289
Rick, we don't have a dog.

23:20.893 --> 23:25.228
Oh, too bad. That's a waste of some good fat.
Are you going to eat your potato, darling?

23:25.399 --> 23:27.833
- You want this?
- You betcha.

23:28.001 --> 23:30.732
Yeah, me and Debbie are
gonna have kids right away.

23:30.972 --> 23:34.464
I'd like to adopt this 17-year-old
Korean girl I've had my eye on.

23:34.642 --> 23:38.443
I figure why beat around the bush,
but, I mean, this pup is fertile,

23:38.647 --> 23:41.810
and I know I'm perfectly capable,
so you don't have to worry.

23:41.984 --> 23:45.216
You'll have some American
grandkids in no time at all.

23:45.622 --> 23:49.388
I tell ya, Mrs T, this is really some
spread. This is pretty good chow.

23:49.626 --> 23:52.323
Usually I just have a
jam sandwich for lunch.

23:52.597 --> 23:57.365
Do you know what a jam sandwich is? You take
two pieces of bread, jam 'em together...

24:03.275 --> 24:06.837
- Hello, everybody! Am I late?
- Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.037
- How are you, Cole?
- Fine, just fine.

24:09.149 --> 24:11.744
Ilene! You're looking very well.

24:13.654 --> 24:15.884
- Mrs Thompson...
- Cole...

24:16.056 --> 24:18.082
Always a pleasure.

24:22.631 --> 24:24.623
Debbie...

24:24.734 --> 24:26.167
And, uh...

24:26.769 --> 24:29.203
Bond. James Bond.

24:30.774 --> 24:33.607
So, Cole, how's your
game coming along?

24:34.178 --> 24:36.772
- Better and better, sir.
- Good.

24:36.981 --> 24:39.040
I'll take you on.

24:39.384 --> 24:42.512
We tried some doubles this
morning but it didn't work out.

24:43.789 --> 24:46.053
Mother, what is Cole doing here?

24:47.226 --> 24:49.888
Well, you know your father
enjoys his company.

24:50.130 --> 24:54.260
Oh, he must, if he took time off
from his Hitler Youth rally.

24:58.005 --> 25:00.439
- Good shot!
- Thank you, sir.

25:01.576 --> 25:07.709
Cole, I know you're as unhappy as
I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.

25:08.116 --> 25:10.142
Yes, I am, sir.

25:12.422 --> 25:16.153
- Son, I don't want you to give up on her.
- I have tried to change her mind.

25:16.726 --> 25:21.460
It's not her mind you have to change.
It's Mr Shit For Brains in there.

25:22.132 --> 25:26.866
- Yeah, but how can I do that?
- If it were up to me, I'd reason with him first.

25:27.105 --> 25:30.701
And if that failed, I'd try
more persuasive action.

25:33.713 --> 25:37.081
More... persuasive action?

25:40.387 --> 25:44.222
Good... Keep me informed.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.886
Goodbye, darling.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.532
Goodbye, Mom. Thanks for
everything. It was great.

25:52.668 --> 25:57.231
- Nice seeing you again, Rick.
- You too, Mrs T. Let's do this every day.

25:57.407 --> 26:00.774
- How about tomorrow? I'll bring weenies.
- Well, I have, uh... club.

26:00.944 --> 26:04.381
- What time's it over?
- Uh, Rick. Let's talk.

26:05.683 --> 26:08.447
Honey, the boys have
something to discuss.

26:08.653 --> 26:11.487
Let's leave 'em alone
for a minute, huh?

26:12.557 --> 26:15.583
If this is about the facts
of life, I got it covered.

26:15.694 --> 26:18.528
- Rick, I want Debbie.
- You do, huh?

26:18.765 --> 26:21.256
Yes, I do. You dump her
and I'll give you cash.

26:21.434 --> 26:24.563
Well, what's Debbie's Blue
Book value right now?

26:24.705 --> 26:27.139
- $5,000.
- No.

26:27.274 --> 26:29.071
- 7500?
- Not interested.

26:29.276 --> 26:31.438
All right, all right, all right.

26:31.613 --> 26:35.606
10,000 plus a GE toaster oven,

26:35.717 --> 26:38.346
a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...

26:38.521 --> 26:40.546
Cole, read my lips now.

26:40.656 --> 26:43.124
I am marrying Debbie.

26:44.027 --> 26:45.517
Michelin tyres, brand-new.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.220
A set of Sears' best metric tools.

26:50.601 --> 26:51.932
What's going on?

26:52.070 --> 26:56.530
This big lug is in love and he's got a
lot of major appliances laying around.

26:56.842 --> 27:01.905
Debbie, Cole is just trying to save you
from making a mistake. A big mistake.

27:02.348 --> 27:03.907
Oh, Daddy...

27:04.084 --> 27:06.882
Hey, thanks, Dad.
Listen, we gotta go.

27:08.621 --> 27:11.386
Debbie! He's gonna hurt you.

27:12.026 --> 27:15.120
He'll never be true to
you the way I would.

27:16.898 --> 27:20.334
We'll keep that in mind. Cole
Whittier, ladies and gentlemen!

27:20.635 --> 27:25.369
A funny, funny guy as well as being
a wonderfully talented human being.

27:25.541 --> 27:27.907
Take care, babe. We love ya.

27:28.311 --> 27:30.974
Hey, Rick! You and I,
we're not through yet.

27:51.138 --> 27:52.537
Hey...

27:53.006 --> 27:54.439
Hey...

27:54.574 --> 27:55.700
What?

27:55.876 --> 27:57.902
I can't sleep.

27:59.147 --> 28:01.581
I got something for that.

28:08.957 --> 28:12.223
Will you stop fooling around?
I need to talk.

28:12.362 --> 28:14.091
What's the matter?

28:14.330 --> 28:16.856
I don't know. I just feel scared.

28:17.701 --> 28:20.864
Oh, baby... What about?

28:21.939 --> 28:23.965
Hmm?

28:27.012 --> 28:29.503
The wedding. My parents.

28:29.714 --> 28:31.979
Your parents. Our friends.

28:32.151 --> 28:33.448
My job.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.985
The future.

28:35.154 --> 28:36.644
Our relationship.

28:36.823 --> 28:39.452
The caterers. My gown.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.952
Your tuxedo.

28:42.796 --> 28:45.459
The honeymoon. Our apartment.

28:45.633 --> 28:47.123
My shower.

28:47.368 --> 28:49.393
Your bachelor party.

28:51.073 --> 28:55.134
Well, how about the Middle East?
You all right with that?

28:55.411 --> 28:57.812
Honey, everything is
gonna be all right.

28:58.014 --> 29:01.848
Before or after I have
my nervous breakdown?

29:09.093 --> 29:11.358
You are so tense.

29:11.897 --> 29:13.956
Come on.

29:16.101 --> 29:18.161
That feels so good.

29:18.638 --> 29:20.833
That's a coincidence.
It's supposed to.

29:21.007 --> 29:24.705
Close your eyes. Drift
off to sleep again, OK?

29:25.479 --> 29:29.142
It just so happens...
I'm a great guy

29:29.783 --> 29:35.381
and, very soon, you're gonna
be Mrs Great Guy, all right?

30:19.107 --> 30:22.668
Well, there you go, ma'am.
End of the line. Last stop.

30:22.878 --> 30:27.282
I have a great idea. Why don't I just
pal around with you guys for a while?

30:27.483 --> 30:33.081
No, no, no. We have some manly things we
have to do, and this is no place for a woman.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.657
- Are you sure you don't want me to go?
- How about "no"?

30:36.794 --> 30:38.854
I don't wanna go!

30:42.400 --> 30:44.733
Remember, you promised
me no screwing around.

30:44.904 --> 30:48.101
- I won't! I swear on my mother's grave.
- Your mother's not dead.

30:48.274 --> 30:50.709
Well, if I go back on
my word, I'll kill her.

30:52.379 --> 30:53.869
Have a good time.

30:55.882 --> 30:59.148
Don't have a great time. You catch
my drift, Mr Traditional Guy?

30:59.320 --> 31:01.311
Hmm, yeah, I understand.

31:01.422 --> 31:04.654
And you have a
fun shower. Use soap.

31:09.365 --> 31:10.924
I love you.

31:11.134 --> 31:13.159
And I love you.

31:16.506 --> 31:18.941
Come on, Rick! Party!

31:28.320 --> 31:33.020
Presidents have stayed in
this suite. It's gorgeous!

31:34.527 --> 31:36.586
What presidents?

31:38.265 --> 31:41.996
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. Let's get crazy.

31:42.403 --> 31:44.429
Yeah!

31:46.274 --> 31:51.406
- When do the girls show up?
- Gary is taking care of that right now.

31:56.419 --> 31:59.617
All right. I think I've got
just what you're looking for.

31:59.790 --> 32:00.916
Great.

32:01.058 --> 32:02.685
Margot! Darleen!

32:03.761 --> 32:06.161
These are twins of pleasure.

32:07.865 --> 32:09.924
Wow! Twins!

32:10.269 --> 32:11.031
Great!

32:11.236 --> 32:14.034
They're gonna be just fine.
Just fine.

32:15.708 --> 32:16.937
Hi, ladies.

32:17.077 --> 32:22.379
Maybe after the orgy tonight we can get
together, have a cup of coffee or somethin'?

32:22.982 --> 32:26.043
<i>Thanks, man. We'll see
you girls later. Ciao!</i>

32:47.444 --> 32:49.173
Hi!

32:50.882 --> 32:51.712
Hi.

32:51.916 --> 32:54.510
Say, I must have just
missed my friend.

32:54.719 --> 32:57.450
He hired some of your girls
for a bachelor party?

32:57.656 --> 33:02.116
Yeah, Parkview Hotel, room 1002.
What about it?

33:02.595 --> 33:06.191
Yeah, right, well, um...
here's the new address.

33:06.366 --> 33:10.599
There's been a change of plan. We're
sending the girls to his house instead.

33:10.772 --> 33:14.367
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, and, uh... here's a fifty.

33:15.076 --> 33:19.776
Now I want this to be a surprise for
the groom, so you never saw me, OK?

33:20.883 --> 33:22.908
No problem.

33:43.943 --> 33:46.207
Move it out, move it out,
move it out!

33:50.217 --> 33:53.243
You be careful with that bus.
It's a rental.

33:55.823 --> 33:57.485
Was I kidding? Was I kidding?

33:57.692 --> 34:00.024
We who are about to go
apeshit salute you!

34:00.161 --> 34:02.186
We want women!

34:05.434 --> 34:07.493
Hold it! Hold it!

34:07.970 --> 34:10.996
Before we move on,
I have a little surprise.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.906
I have flown in someone
dear to all of us.

34:16.146 --> 34:18.877
A man who has traveled
over 3,000 miles.

34:19.050 --> 34:21.109
Come on, Rick, let's go.

34:21.219 --> 34:25.020
A man whom none of us have
seen since he left town.

34:27.391 --> 34:28.791
Come on, come on!

34:28.960 --> 34:31.623
A man whom we affectionately
call Peckerhead!

34:31.797 --> 34:34.289
Oh, my God, our dad is here.

34:34.467 --> 34:36.936
It's your childhood chum
and mine, Brad Mollen!

34:37.237 --> 34:38.034
Brad!

34:38.239 --> 34:40.706
<i>That Peckerhead! Where is he?</i>

34:46.181 --> 34:47.170
Guys!

34:47.815 --> 34:48.840
Guys!

34:48.984 --> 34:51.010
Guys! Guys!

34:52.088 --> 34:55.420
For the last time, I'm telling
you to get off of there!

34:56.259 --> 34:57.989
Off! Off!

34:58.195 --> 34:59.355
OK!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.332
Guys!

35:05.103 --> 35:07.128
Holy shit!

35:08.273 --> 35:09.570
Dr Stan!

35:09.707 --> 35:11.300
Hi, Brad.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.173
Rick! Oh, Rick! Rick!

35:15.214 --> 35:17.240
Jay!

35:18.485 --> 35:19.611
Rudy!

35:20.186 --> 35:21.619
Diagnosis?

35:21.821 --> 35:23.687
- Medically speaking?
- Yeah.

35:23.891 --> 35:26.223
Whacked out of his brains on drugs.

35:26.394 --> 35:29.158
I love you guys! This is great!
This is beautiful!

35:29.397 --> 35:30.831
I love it! I love it!

35:31.033 --> 35:32.091
How you been?

35:32.234 --> 35:37.229
Oh, I couldn't be better. This is the best.
This is great. I love this. This is the best.

35:37.373 --> 35:41.139
I'm having the best time. I love
you guys! I love everybody!

35:41.311 --> 35:45.408
- How's your wife?
- I hate her. I hate her guts.

35:46.150 --> 35:47.913
The bitch!

35:50.455 --> 35:53.015
I've got this.
You wanna share this?

35:53.224 --> 35:56.284
Oh, gee, two on a Quaalude.
That's bad luck.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.429
OK, let's go, guys. Come on, Brad.

35:59.565 --> 36:02.125
Listen, you and your wife
got problems, Brad?

36:02.335 --> 36:07.035
No. No. Cos I love you guys.
I love my friends. I love everybody!

36:07.240 --> 36:08.832
I just wanna party!

36:09.076 --> 36:10.510
Party!

36:26.730 --> 36:30.462
- Just where do you guys think you are?
- The Library of Congress?

36:30.668 --> 36:32.829
- Detroit?
- Beyond the sun?

36:33.504 --> 36:34.971
Any of those right?

36:35.172 --> 36:38.472
This is the Parkview Hotel.
I am the hotel manager.

36:41.346 --> 36:45.477
This is a respectable establishment.
We don't go for any funny business here.

36:45.818 --> 36:49.219
So I see. Well, thank you. It's
been very nice talking to you.

36:49.355 --> 36:52.450
You're a hell of a guy, and
you're doing a hell of a job.

37:03.371 --> 37:07.832
Pamela, you're here! How nice!
Come say hello to our guest of honor.

37:09.245 --> 37:12.682
Pamela! Hi, how are you!
Good to see you!

37:13.450 --> 37:16.214
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

37:16.420 --> 37:18.855
Debbie, it's Pamela.

37:19.023 --> 37:21.116
Pamela, how are you?

37:22.093 --> 37:24.927
Come sit down and I'll
get you some punch.

37:26.465 --> 37:30.960
Mrs Thompson, do you have any more
of this dip? It's, like, really excellent.

37:31.204 --> 37:33.035
You just ate Purina Cat Chow.

37:33.239 --> 37:35.673
Oh, it's, like, so good!

37:41.348 --> 37:43.943
And what are you girls
giggling about?

37:44.186 --> 37:46.586
- Shall we tell her?
- Yeah.

37:47.255 --> 37:51.488
Yesterday we found a bunch of pornos
in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

37:51.627 --> 37:56.360
And we made a few changes. I think
the boys will really be interested.

38:00.204 --> 38:03.697
Oh, well, good. I hope you ruin
their stag party, the swine!

38:04.609 --> 38:06.634
1003... Aha!

38:08.046 --> 38:09.513
1002.

38:09.714 --> 38:15.244
And now, to our honored guest Rick and
his lifelong friends, I say, gentlemen:

38:17.491 --> 38:18.856
Start your boners.

38:23.898 --> 38:25.957
Women!

38:29.437 --> 38:32.498
Yeah! This is a bitchin' place!

38:33.809 --> 38:36.938
Oh... I am stunned.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.344
I did the balloons myself.

38:40.183 --> 38:45.019
Oh, what a clever use of prophylactics.
This is beyond my wildest dreams, guys!

38:45.222 --> 38:49.625
- Where's the women? There's no women.
- Rudy, one thing at a time.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.093
<i>Sex is my one thing.
I'm good at it.</i>

38:52.297 --> 38:53.855
OK. What's first?

38:54.065 --> 38:58.264
<i>A bit of a warm-up. We spend an
hour with Nymphos Without Pants.</i>

39:01.541 --> 39:03.202
Olivier is in that, right?

39:03.376 --> 39:06.107
Then... it's on to the real thing!

39:06.380 --> 39:08.439
OK, Rudy. Screen.

39:11.319 --> 39:13.310
It's good to see you, Brad.

39:13.454 --> 39:17.892
My marriage sucks. It's all crap.
It's just a big pile of shit!

39:19.562 --> 39:23.829
Well, maybe your marriage oughta
lay off the grains for a while.

39:24.868 --> 39:28.929
Don't you understand? She hates me.
She hates my guts. It's over!

39:29.072 --> 39:33.169
You'll see. As soon as you get
married, everything changes.

39:33.678 --> 39:35.873
Why are you going
through with this?

39:36.013 --> 39:38.448
Wait, wait. What do you mean?
What changes?

39:38.617 --> 39:40.346
OK, Ryko, lights!

39:41.720 --> 39:42.744
Lights!

40:02.110 --> 40:05.672
I viewed it yesterday.
Great director, good lighting...

40:08.751 --> 40:12.984
Take that off! Take it
off and drive it home!

40:15.592 --> 40:18.619
God, this doesn't waste
any time, does it?

40:23.769 --> 40:27.466
Go, baby! Do it, brother! Lay that pipe!
Drive it home, brother!

40:33.647 --> 40:35.478
Hey! What gives?

40:36.383 --> 40:38.852
- Did you check this out?
- Kick it! Kick it!

40:40.955 --> 40:43.185
Forget that. This
part's so much better.

40:43.357 --> 40:47.351
You guys can't believe... This is a
human being doing this. Watch this.

40:47.562 --> 40:50.053
Kiss him all the way down!
All the way down!

40:50.466 --> 40:53.902
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

40:58.475 --> 41:01.000
What is this?! What is going on?!

41:03.314 --> 41:07.149
I am not complaining, but I usually
don't like my filth this clean.

41:07.385 --> 41:09.819
What a waste of two women!

41:11.223 --> 41:14.454
I don't get it. The dirty
parts were there yesterday.

41:14.627 --> 41:17.062
At least Gary's coming
up with the real thing.

41:17.230 --> 41:18.356
Oh, yeah.

41:18.532 --> 41:20.591
Women!

41:41.458 --> 41:42.220
Yes?

41:42.459 --> 41:46.863
Yeah, hi. Is this
1381 Franek Street?

41:48.132 --> 41:49.565
Yes.

41:49.734 --> 41:51.794
We're here.

41:51.937 --> 41:53.996
How nice.

41:54.239 --> 41:57.403
Um... I'm Dr Tina Gassko.

41:57.944 --> 42:00.538
Oh, Tina! Stan's wife!

42:00.947 --> 42:03.006
Come in!

42:05.986 --> 42:11.050
God, now she's really gonna see what
kind of a jerk-off she's marryin'.

42:20.136 --> 42:22.627
Rick is just gonna
love all of these.

42:23.907 --> 42:26.398
Debbie, look, it's Tina.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.044
I think everyone's here now.

42:30.147 --> 42:32.582
Look who's here. It's Tina.

42:48.535 --> 42:50.264
Another one of these, huh?

42:50.438 --> 42:51.837
Looks that way.

42:51.972 --> 42:53.303
A buck's a buck.

42:53.441 --> 42:54.874
Yep.

43:18.803 --> 43:20.464
Ohh!

43:29.615 --> 43:32.346
Is there an empty
outlet around here?

43:36.756 --> 43:38.281
Thanks.

44:19.706 --> 44:21.833
God, this is beautiful.

44:22.009 --> 44:25.446
She reminds me of my wife.
She was so young when we met.

44:26.347 --> 44:27.939
Bitch!

44:31.086 --> 44:33.281
Hi, guys, how's it goin'?

44:33.923 --> 44:36.050
Get him! Get him, get him, get him!

44:39.963 --> 44:42.761
Everybody back! To a
neutral corner, please.

44:42.966 --> 44:45.800
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing's goin' on!

44:47.672 --> 44:50.106
Would you get that
animal off of me?

44:50.274 --> 44:53.108
This place should be
wall-to-wall tits by now.

44:53.312 --> 44:55.746
Guy paints a beautiful picture.

44:56.114 --> 45:00.279
All right! All right! I'll
find out what's goin' on.

45:01.087 --> 45:03.852
Looks like the only guy
who got screwed was you.

45:04.091 --> 45:05.080
Hey, screw you.

45:05.192 --> 45:06.955
Should! Should!

45:07.161 --> 45:08.025
Should!

45:08.262 --> 45:10.493
I can't believe my
money's been wasted.

45:10.665 --> 45:13.031
So, what do you guys think
of the party so far?

45:14.135 --> 45:16.160
All right. OK.

45:18.107 --> 45:21.508
I think the man has done a very
good job with the party so far.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.703
All right, maybe not.

45:28.118 --> 45:30.245
Rick, I wanna talk to you.

45:30.421 --> 45:32.480
Hey, it's Cole!

45:34.258 --> 45:37.023
Did anyone order an asshole
from room service?

45:37.196 --> 45:40.927
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- Oh, come on, just a little.

45:42.201 --> 45:46.070
- Rick, I want to make you another deal.
- Oh, be still, my heart!

45:46.306 --> 45:48.672
Out the window is something
I wanna show you.

45:48.808 --> 45:53.576
Out the window? Oh, this is gonna be
a surprise. I'm a nut for surprises.

45:55.383 --> 45:57.181
You see that out there?

45:57.386 --> 46:00.253
That, Rick, is my most
prized possession.

46:00.455 --> 46:02.082
That's my new Porsche.

46:02.257 --> 46:03.885
Wow!

46:04.060 --> 46:05.652
Guys, can you see that car?

46:05.828 --> 46:09.161
Oh, that's beautiful! What a car!

46:10.367 --> 46:13.063
Rudy, isn't that a beautiful car?

46:13.237 --> 46:14.966
Yeah.

46:15.172 --> 46:18.700
Oh, yeah! That's a
beautiful car, Rick.

46:18.877 --> 46:22.369
Hey, guys, excuse me.
I gotta go shake the weasel.

46:23.148 --> 46:25.242
- It's a great car.
- Oh, the best!

46:25.384 --> 46:30.584
- God, I love that car.
- I am very, very happy... for the two of you.

46:30.757 --> 46:32.486
Chips?

46:32.659 --> 46:37.427
Listen, Rick, I'm willing to trade you my
new Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.

46:37.632 --> 46:40.760
Oh, Cole! A car for Debbie?

46:41.669 --> 46:44.662
I mean it, Rick. All you
have to do is dump Debbie.

46:44.807 --> 46:49.403
Oh! Oh, Cole! This is perplexing.
What an intriguing offer you've made.

46:49.611 --> 46:53.605
Guys, what should I do? Should I take
the car, or should I take Debbie?

46:53.717 --> 46:55.981
- Debbie.
- The car.

46:56.119 --> 46:57.348
Depends on mileage.

46:57.488 --> 47:00.821
- The Porsche! The car!
- Take Debbie... The car!

47:15.208 --> 47:18.372
- Debbie! Debbie!
- The car!

47:18.679 --> 47:20.943
What a decision
I have to make here.

47:21.448 --> 47:23.575
I would hate to be
in your shoes, pal.

47:23.752 --> 47:27.381
- Low mileage. It handles like a dream.
- Well, so does Debbie.

47:27.555 --> 47:31.424
I just got that car two months ago.
It's got everything, it's got...

47:31.627 --> 47:33.026
Shit.

47:33.162 --> 47:35.460
Shit! Shit! Shit!

47:36.332 --> 47:39.166
- Something amiss?
- My car is gone!

47:39.369 --> 47:40.927
Maybe it had something to do.

47:41.138 --> 47:42.264
You know...

47:42.439 --> 47:45.500
If I don't get my car back,
you're dead, mister!

47:50.883 --> 47:53.716
Gone just a few seconds
and I miss him already.

47:56.488 --> 47:59.720
Isn't it childish getting
revenge on the guys like this?

47:59.859 --> 48:04.490
You heard what those hookers said. They
were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

48:04.698 --> 48:06.825
That doesn't mean it
was Rick's party.

48:06.967 --> 48:09.333
Good evening, ladies. Follow me.

48:09.737 --> 48:12.229
Go on. Just don't touch anything.

48:13.975 --> 48:16.273
God, look at those guys!
What a hunk!

48:16.745 --> 48:19.214
Look at that guy's buns!

48:22.919 --> 48:24.478
Come on, Mom.

48:24.688 --> 48:26.246
Debbie, I don't know about this.

48:26.423 --> 48:30.120
Mom, come on, we'll have a great time.
You might even get lucky.

48:30.327 --> 48:31.852
Debbie!

48:47.747 --> 48:50.215
Is there a Rick Gassko
registered there?

48:56.958 --> 48:59.689
Hold it! It's not Gary.
It's Michael.

49:00.128 --> 49:01.288
I don't believe it!

49:01.430 --> 49:03.729
I may as well have left
my genitals at home!

49:03.867 --> 49:06.062
Michael, when are you comin' over?

49:06.603 --> 49:08.594
Right after work.

49:08.738 --> 49:12.607
Guess what, buddy? Debbie and
her friends just walked in here.

49:12.977 --> 49:16.435
No kidding! Well,
that's interesting.

49:17.415 --> 49:21.818
Michael, hang around down there for
a while. We're gonna come down.

49:21.987 --> 49:23.386
Yeah. Bye.

49:23.555 --> 49:26.081
Guys, we are going
out for some air.

49:28.361 --> 49:29.589
Some air?

49:29.762 --> 49:31.788
- Where are we going?
- Out.

49:32.099 --> 49:33.828
I love going out.

49:34.034 --> 49:37.061
Rick, I don't think I wanna go.

49:37.205 --> 49:39.230
Come on, Brad,
it'll be good for ya.

49:39.574 --> 49:42.372
No... I just wanna be alone.

49:44.813 --> 49:49.375
Well... all right, but do your homework,
and you can watch TV for a half-hour,

49:49.585 --> 49:51.679
but then straight
to bed, young man.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.355
OK.

49:57.728 --> 50:02.427
Come on, just stay with me, guys.
When a night gets dull, call in a pro.

50:09.074 --> 50:10.098
Al, how are you?

50:10.242 --> 50:13.474
Ed, we're so glad you could
come at the last minute

50:13.646 --> 50:15.773
and fill in as our keynote speaker.

50:15.915 --> 50:18.714
It's a pleasure, Al.
I'm always glad to help out.

50:18.919 --> 50:21.911
I should call my service.
Is there a phone I can use?

50:22.056 --> 50:24.184
- Yeah, right there.
- Thank you.

50:24.359 --> 50:28.557
Ed, this is the biggest turnout we've
ever had. Hey, this is our mascot.

50:28.697 --> 50:30.393
Hiya, fellas!

50:30.566 --> 50:34.969
We've had some big speakers, but no
one with your marketing experience.

50:35.137 --> 50:39.472
I just wanna let 'em know where I am.
I'm expecting an important phone call.

50:39.576 --> 50:44.071
I had to get out of the house anyway.
My daughter's having a bridal shower.

51:23.626 --> 51:26.061
I'm a doctor! I can't do this!

51:35.240 --> 51:38.267
- Will your friend do this?
- He'll do anything for money.

51:38.377 --> 51:40.174
I love that attitude!

51:40.379 --> 51:43.576
- Are they still out there?
- I'll check. Wait.

51:53.861 --> 51:54.987
I don't believe this!

52:03.172 --> 52:05.733
What does she think she's doing?

52:05.942 --> 52:07.967
Maybe checking him for a hernia.

52:09.846 --> 52:11.906
Oh, it's amusing?

52:13.050 --> 52:14.642
- It's amusing.
- What now?

52:14.819 --> 52:18.119
It's action they want? Well,
we're the guys to give it to 'em.

52:18.256 --> 52:20.315
Eh, me hearties?

52:22.594 --> 52:26.053
Guys, this is Chippendales'
star attraction.

52:26.365 --> 52:30.996
Mr Nicholas, better
known as Nick the Dick.

52:31.371 --> 52:33.100
Nick the what?

52:33.273 --> 52:35.332
The Dick.

52:41.449 --> 52:44.146
Oh-ho! Wow!

52:46.489 --> 52:49.617
I was impressed when they
opened the World Trade Center,

52:49.725 --> 52:52.354
but this is a piece of work!

52:52.629 --> 52:56.224
Well, let's get this thing going.
Tray, please, Michael.

52:58.936 --> 53:00.426
Bun.

53:01.272 --> 53:03.467
Oh, well now, this is good.

53:03.674 --> 53:06.075
OK, Nick, or is it Mr Dick?

53:07.012 --> 53:08.877
Nick.

53:09.081 --> 53:11.209
You wanna do the honors?

53:17.958 --> 53:20.586
- It's up to you.
- Gentlemen.

53:22.530 --> 53:24.624
This is gonna be great!

53:34.277 --> 53:37.714
Here's your orders, ladies.
You can help yourselves.

53:52.998 --> 53:54.397
Is that the foot-long?

53:54.533 --> 53:56.558
And then some.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.192
Excuse us. Mom, let go.

54:51.132 --> 54:53.157
Hey, lady, how much?

54:53.668 --> 54:55.761
Talk to the pimp.

54:56.938 --> 54:57.928
Hi.

54:58.374 --> 54:59.432
Hi.

54:59.575 --> 55:01.065
Hey, nice seeing you.

55:01.243 --> 55:02.608
Hello.

55:04.347 --> 55:06.372
Hey, let's talk.

55:06.950 --> 55:09.316
Hey, bro! What it be?

55:09.853 --> 55:13.984
- You're a pimp? You look like Gandhi.
- I'm telling you I am, Joe.

55:14.091 --> 55:16.218
- I want women.
- I got women.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.795
They sit on your face,
anything you want.

55:18.997 --> 55:21.022
Great. I want some. How much?

55:21.400 --> 55:24.859
Big hassle now, bro.
Soon they go to customers.

55:25.104 --> 55:28.369
I got a bachelor party
at the Parkview Hotel.

55:28.508 --> 55:31.103
That would be out of sight, dude.

55:31.278 --> 55:33.610
Customers in same hotel.

55:33.781 --> 55:38.014
Let you have them at cut-rate
price for 45 minutes.

55:38.186 --> 55:40.916
- $200.
- Great.

55:41.089 --> 55:43.523
Sold. 45 minutes, no problem.

55:43.658 --> 55:44.990
Room 1002.

55:45.261 --> 55:48.560
Not one minute longer or
Milt will come for you.

55:48.698 --> 55:50.222
Milt?

55:50.434 --> 55:52.163
This being Milt.

55:54.671 --> 55:56.696
Pretty heavy, hey, dude?

56:01.646 --> 56:04.081
Girls back in 45 minutes

56:04.550 --> 56:07.246
or Milt cuts your balls off.

56:07.453 --> 56:08.886
Fair enough?

56:09.054 --> 56:10.420
Shake.

56:17.465 --> 56:20.332
I just bet my balls,
and shook on it.

56:24.306 --> 56:26.035
Did you happen to see Tina's face?

56:26.274 --> 56:31.144
Bobbi was less shocked, of course.
She's used to seeing something that size.

56:32.448 --> 56:34.313
Hey, yo! Brad!

56:35.718 --> 56:37.744
Hey! Big Brad!

56:40.057 --> 56:41.684
Where's the young man?

56:50.201 --> 56:51.965
What are you doing?

56:52.171 --> 56:54.230
I'm killing myself.

56:54.807 --> 56:56.240
Oh.

57:04.318 --> 57:07.754
You know, Brad, marriage
is a dicey thing at best.

57:07.922 --> 57:10.619
And sometimes people say
things they don't mean.

57:10.793 --> 57:14.524
But you and Sue, you're mature people.
You'll work this stuff out.

57:14.730 --> 57:18.758
- You gotta lighten up, man.
- No, Rick, I don't care any more!

57:18.902 --> 57:24.102
She hates me! I'm no good for her.
I'm just gonna end it all right here!

57:26.510 --> 57:29.240
Oh! Oh! God!

57:31.616 --> 57:33.413
Are you all right?

57:33.618 --> 57:35.677
Yeah.

57:36.555 --> 57:39.116
Pain is such a rush.

57:40.927 --> 57:42.918
Oh, this is good.

57:43.062 --> 57:46.464
- Is there anything I can do for ya?
- Oh, no...

57:47.734 --> 57:49.759
This is pain.

57:50.370 --> 57:52.396
Fabulous.

57:52.740 --> 57:55.368
There could be some
major damage here.

57:59.982 --> 58:02.576
Mmm! Mmmm!

58:18.203 --> 58:21.764
Hey, man! Go check out
your car. It's beautiful.

58:22.007 --> 58:24.704
- My car? Where is it?
- It's outside.

58:37.259 --> 58:39.124
Shit!

58:41.029 --> 58:43.054
Shit!

58:44.734 --> 58:46.793
Oh, shit!

58:47.970 --> 58:48.994
Shit!

58:49.572 --> 58:50.597
Shit!

58:51.341 --> 58:53.002
Shit! Shit!

58:53.343 --> 58:56.005
Rick, goddamnit!

58:56.446 --> 58:59.678
You've had it! I'm gonna get you!

59:10.362 --> 59:11.921
Shit!

59:12.098 --> 59:13.656
Shit! Shit!

59:16.202 --> 59:19.730
This is your bachelor party,
and you're not havin' a good time.

59:19.907 --> 59:21.636
I'm having a great time!

59:21.809 --> 59:24.301
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

59:24.746 --> 59:27.146
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I don't know.

59:27.282 --> 59:29.307
Surprise!

59:29.818 --> 59:32.287
The team bus just pulled in!

59:38.796 --> 59:40.058
Hookers!

59:40.197 --> 59:42.859
It's a party! Party, Ricky!

59:53.546 --> 59:56.037
I had a wiener right in my hand.

59:56.182 --> 01:00:00.916
I told you, men are pigs. I saw
those swine just standing there.

01:00:01.154 --> 01:00:03.588
God! What a gross thing to do.

01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:07.626
I have to admit, even for Rick, that
was beyond the Valley of Good Taste.

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:11.960
Yeah, well, Rick and his pals are
probably knee-deep in whores by now.

01:00:12.134 --> 01:00:14.898
- I can't wait to see what those guys are up to.
- Me either.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:18.729
If I find out Stanley's been
screwing around, I'll kill him.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:23.403
Kill? I won't do anything that drastic.
I just won't get married.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.106
Good. You're finally
talking some sense.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.583
Well... let's get ready,
you guys. Let's get going.

01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:34.215
- You with us, Mom?
- A strange wang right in my palm.

01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:39.726
- Can I help you?
- We're the band.

01:00:39.899 --> 01:00:41.594
- Band?
- O'Neill sent us.

01:00:41.801 --> 01:00:43.564
Oh, O'Neill! Great!

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:47.605
Everybody's busy in the bedrooms
right now, but come on in.

01:00:47.808 --> 01:00:51.677
Oh, that's nice hair. I'll try to
make sure no one smokes around you.

01:00:51.846 --> 01:00:54.872
Are you together? If not, maybe
introductions are in order.

01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:01.214
Why do good girls like bad boys?

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:05.219
Why do good girls like bad boys?

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:10.828
It must be the thrill she gets
When he lights her cigarette

01:01:11.269 --> 01:01:14.830
Or the way his nostrils flare
Every time he combs his hair

01:01:15.273 --> 01:01:17.002
Why do good girls like bad boys?

01:01:23.248 --> 01:01:25.012
Why do good girls like bad boys?

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:28.044
Alligator!

01:01:42.938 --> 01:01:46.602
Hey, that was incredible.
And also wonderful.

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:51.574
It was a moving experience. I thank you.
From the bottom of my heart.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.808
Next!

01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:57.712
Ricky! Go, babe.
Get in there, my brother.

01:01:58.156 --> 01:02:01.148
My dearest family member,
get in there. She's incredible.

01:02:01.326 --> 01:02:05.525
No, no, no. I will, but the party's
young and it's just starting up.

01:02:05.664 --> 01:02:09.930
I want to ask you a question first. You're my
older brother. Let me ask you some advice.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:13.163
You are a married man, right?
I am about to be a married man.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.741
What can I expect from this marriage
thing? What is the honest scoop?

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:22.076
The honest scoop? The first month, from
the beginning, is terrific. It's great.

01:02:22.683 --> 01:02:25.744
The second month, things
calm down a little bit.

01:02:27.723 --> 01:02:31.785
Third month, you're looking through
old phone numbers, old girlfriends...

01:02:31.928 --> 01:02:37.367
But, by the fourth month... by the fourth
month you're just... you're numb.

01:02:38.169 --> 01:02:40.399
You know? Just... It's incredible.

01:02:40.538 --> 01:02:44.066
So by the fifth month, hopefully,
football season starts.

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:47.542
<i>- Football.
- You got ball games. You got Monday Night.</i>

01:02:47.712 --> 01:02:54.118
Stan, I am so glad we had this chat.
You've really answered my questions.

01:02:55.788 --> 01:03:00.556
Hi. We were just walking by and we
heard the music. Can we come in?

01:03:00.761 --> 01:03:04.425
Sure! Come on in!
Join the party, babe.

01:03:13.342 --> 01:03:15.105
What can I get for 25 bucks?

01:03:15.544 --> 01:03:19.140
An elevator ride around the block,
a pogo pump, or a pogo swirl,

01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:21.613
or a pump with an
underground hammer.

01:03:21.785 --> 01:03:24.846
Wait a minute. Whatever
happened to hand jobs?

01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:44.038
Hi.

01:03:44.178 --> 01:03:45.873
Hello.

01:04:02.832 --> 01:04:04.323
I was dreaming

01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:05.934
Woke up screaming

01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:08.094
I was drowning in a pool of sweat

01:04:09.239 --> 01:04:10.969
My hands were shaking

01:04:11.142 --> 01:04:12.700
My head was aching

01:04:12.877 --> 01:04:14.902
My stomach was so upset

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:22.652
That's when I saw two
eyes glowing in the dark

01:04:23.122 --> 01:04:26.490
I fell in love with a little demon

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.857
Little demon, little demon

01:04:30.263 --> 01:04:33.791
Angels above can't
take my little demon

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:36.665
Little demon, little demon

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:39.136
Little demon!

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.038
She crawled up beside me

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.309
Her smile terrified me

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.182
And I was suffering in ecstasy

01:05:05.805 --> 01:05:09.206
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm slashing my wrists.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:13.107
- With an electric razor?
- I couldn't find any razor blades.

01:05:13.914 --> 01:05:16.712
At least your wrists will
be smooth and kissable.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:19.478
Give me this thing! What
is the matter with you?

01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:23.954
Will you go out there and have some
fun and have a few laughs, please?

01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:29.696
No, no, no. Have fun first,
and then have a few laughs.

01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:32.697
Just forget about the marriage
for a couple of hours.

01:05:32.902 --> 01:05:35.996
This is a party, remember?
Go out there and party.

01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:41.406
That's good. That's good.

01:05:55.461 --> 01:05:57.760
Gary, how's the big stallion?

01:05:58.032 --> 01:06:00.500
Rick, I really think I'm in love.

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:06.136
We're talking marriage,
kids, the whole thing.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:11.509
I'm very happy for you. Name your
first six kids after me, OK?

01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:03.761
My name is Tim.
I'm always available.

01:07:03.907 --> 01:07:06.535
By the way, I also do
engine work on BMWs.

01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:08.305
Bye.

01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:54.193
That's another example of better
living through chemistry.

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:55.958
I said that's another example...

01:07:56.133 --> 01:07:58.898
Are these on or am
I wasting my time?

01:08:11.118 --> 01:08:12.551
All right!

01:08:14.087 --> 01:08:15.952
This is gonna be great.

01:08:16.156 --> 01:08:18.022
Sex with a donkey. Incredible.

01:08:48.827 --> 01:08:50.921
Hi! Come on in!

01:08:51.163 --> 01:08:53.724
Drugs to the right,
hookers to the left.

01:08:57.371 --> 01:08:59.395
Good to see ya again.

01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:27.698
Hey! I oughta smack you.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.143
Rick, buddy... pal of mine...

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:35.741
- I'm concerned.
- Hey! What about?

01:09:35.913 --> 01:09:40.249
This is your party! Your bachelor party!
You haven't had sex with anyone yet.

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.684
Not true. I had a
bunch of sex tonight.

01:09:42.856 --> 01:09:46.850
I'm just very fast. You haven't been
able to see me. There...  I had it twice!

01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:49.520
Come on. I got something
you can't resist.

01:09:49.697 --> 01:09:50.687
You do?

01:09:50.832 --> 01:09:52.857
You remember Tracey?

01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:56.999
Tracey? I am a mortal man, O'Neill.
Of course I remember Tracey.

01:09:57.206 --> 01:09:59.674
You remember how crazy
she was about you?

01:09:59.842 --> 01:10:05.179
- Tracey was crazy about me?
- "Oh, Rick, you're so funny!"

01:10:05.316 --> 01:10:10.015
I called her and told her that you were
about to be put on the unavailable list.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.213
She decided to come over and
give you a little something.

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:15.384
She did?

01:10:15.727 --> 01:10:18.720
- Right in there.
- The bedroom? Tracey's in the bedroom?

01:10:18.864 --> 01:10:19.888
You got it.

01:10:20.066 --> 01:10:22.933
- Tracey is in the bedroom?
- Heaven awaits.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.465
O'Neill...

01:10:29.743 --> 01:10:33.942
Oh... well, now, O'Neill,
this is a gift I...

01:10:34.115 --> 01:10:36.140
You bet.

01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:39.446
How can I...
how can I turn this down?

01:10:39.555 --> 01:10:41.113
You can't.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.315
I guess I can't.

01:10:43.726 --> 01:10:45.957
- Oh, Tracey...?
- Yeah.

01:10:48.131 --> 01:10:51.761
Oh, hell, all right. All right, I will.
All right, OK. I will. All right.

01:10:51.936 --> 01:10:54.769
If I'm not back in half an
hour, call the paramedics.

01:10:54.939 --> 01:10:56.167
All right.

01:10:56.307 --> 01:10:57.900
That's the old Rick!

01:11:06.419 --> 01:11:07.977
Hello?

01:11:16.296 --> 01:11:18.322
Oh, eat my chair!

01:11:33.517 --> 01:11:36.145
Rick, take me, please.

01:11:38.556 --> 01:11:41.116
Rick, you promised me.

01:11:41.259 --> 01:11:44.787
You promised me you wouldn't
make love to anybody else.

01:11:45.798 --> 01:11:47.789
Go for it! Go for it!

01:11:53.406 --> 01:11:58.640
Don't go back on your word, Rick.
Be true. Be strong.

01:11:58.779 --> 01:12:00.542
Go for it!

01:12:01.115 --> 01:12:05.280
What, are you nuts? Look at
my tits! They're perfect!

01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:08.854
Rick, take me, please.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.892
How'd it go?

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:20.594
Well, hey... Hey, if she can walk,
I don't know my business, you know?

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:26.006
Oh, hey, O'Neill, I just lied. Nothing
happened in there, all right?

01:12:26.177 --> 01:12:29.578
I know how much this meant to
ya, but I couldn't do it, OK?

01:12:29.714 --> 01:12:32.548
I love Debbie. I made a promise
and I'm crazy about her.

01:12:32.718 --> 01:12:34.777
Hey, I understand.

01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:36.813
Don't worry about it.

01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:42.290
To tell you the truth, I'm envious. I wish
I had someone who was in my every thought.

01:12:42.395 --> 01:12:44.956
Somebody I could spend
all my time with.

01:12:45.633 --> 01:12:48.067
Somebody I could really respect.

01:12:48.236 --> 01:12:50.831
Hey, look at the
cans on that bimbo.

01:14:04.757 --> 01:14:07.783
I am looking for this dung
head who took my women.

01:14:07.927 --> 01:14:09.792
He's being liar to me.

01:14:09.963 --> 01:14:11.693
I want my bitches back.

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:31.480
Holy shit! I'm going
to get Milt right now.

01:14:31.655 --> 01:14:33.816
I'm going to get the
fuck out of here.

01:14:40.732 --> 01:14:42.927
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:45.094
- Well, what is this?
- Got me.

01:14:46.238 --> 01:14:49.503
- Well, how about this?
- Still drawing a blank.

01:14:52.145 --> 01:14:54.943
- Hey, he look familiar?
- Very.

01:14:55.148 --> 01:14:59.313
Get the hookers in a circle. We're
gonna put Cochise out of business.

01:15:12.568 --> 01:15:14.593
I can't believe we're doing this.

01:15:14.704 --> 01:15:17.503
We are supposed to
be hookers. Act sexy.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.112
If Stanley's there
I'll rip his butt.

01:15:25.283 --> 01:15:29.583
Stop with this! We're supposed
to be hookers! Act sexy!

01:15:31.791 --> 01:15:34.521
- I just wanna find him up there...
- Shut up with that.

01:15:34.694 --> 01:15:39.189
Don't tell me to shut up. We don't need
sex, we just have to find the room.

01:15:44.238 --> 01:15:46.103
You girls is the hookers, right?

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.399
Yes, of course we're hookers.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:03.716
- The boss said deliver hookers.
- We are not hookers, you big dumb ape!

01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:13.094
How dare you!

01:16:19.112 --> 01:16:21.808
Girls, let's get outta here...

01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:24.041
Wonderful!

01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:35.195
Any of you guys from out of town?

01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:38.732
Come on, fellas... Fellas!

01:16:47.677 --> 01:16:49.042
Where the hell is he?

01:16:49.913 --> 01:16:53.406
- It's gotta be on this side.
- No, it's this side.

01:16:59.091 --> 01:17:00.888
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:17:01.093 --> 01:17:03.118
All right, this is it.

01:17:03.395 --> 01:17:05.830
Let me fix you up here.
Let's show the gold.

01:17:05.965 --> 01:17:07.990
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

01:17:09.035 --> 01:17:11.095
OK. Go get him.

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:30.518
Make love to me... please?

01:17:54.387 --> 01:17:59.519
T minus 3, 2, 1. We have ignition!

01:17:59.794 --> 01:18:01.819
Kill!

01:18:10.607 --> 01:18:13.041
We got him now!

01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:17.170
No! No!

01:18:20.184 --> 01:18:21.742
You can't do this!

01:18:22.286 --> 01:18:25.586
We're just gonna put you in a
safe place until after the party.

01:18:26.491 --> 01:18:30.325
No, no! Please! Please stop!
Don't! No!

01:18:30.997 --> 01:18:33.090
Hey! Hey, you guys can't do this!

01:18:33.599 --> 01:18:36.067
Hey! Hey, come on!

01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:44.106
Now you stay out of
trouble, young man.

01:18:44.245 --> 01:18:45.371
Take care!

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.710
I hope you die, you bastard!

01:18:47.882 --> 01:18:49.907
Bye!

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.353
Hey, you bastards! I'm gonna live!

01:18:56.825 --> 01:18:57.850
Aaghhh!

01:18:58.628 --> 01:19:00.357
Well, here we are.

01:19:01.498 --> 01:19:06.368
This is gonna be some night, huh?
Are you ready for this? Are you ready?

01:19:08.105 --> 01:19:10.130
Come here.

01:19:12.844 --> 01:19:17.407
Look, uh... why don't you make
yourself comfortable, all right?

01:19:20.586 --> 01:19:22.986
There's a terrific
moon out tonight.

01:19:54.158 --> 01:19:57.252
OK, we're here. How do we
get this donkey inside?

01:19:57.363 --> 01:19:59.388
I don't know.

01:20:00.566 --> 01:20:03.694
You don't know? You had it all
figured out. You had a plan.

01:20:03.802 --> 01:20:06.431
Well, maybe I did.
I don't know. I forgot.

01:20:08.775 --> 01:20:12.439
I'd like to get you on an
operating table, just once.

01:20:14.749 --> 01:20:17.047
Ha-ha-ha!

01:20:17.184 --> 01:20:19.016
Ha-ha-ha what?

01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:21.585
- I got it.
- You got what?

01:20:23.658 --> 01:20:27.925
You're gonna be OK. Everything's
gonna be fine. Don't worry about it.

01:20:28.064 --> 01:20:33.093
How about some air? You can take in
some air. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:34.932
Take in some air, huh?

01:20:38.443 --> 01:20:39.967
Oh, no! Shit!

01:20:42.447 --> 01:20:44.814
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes.

01:20:54.861 --> 01:20:56.692
Ohh, God...!

01:20:58.433 --> 01:20:59.991
They seemed like nice guys.

01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:04.799
- Thanks for your help, Ed. We appreciate it.
- Any time, Al. Good night.

01:21:06.075 --> 01:21:09.806
Cole?! My God, son, what are
you doing here? What happened?

01:21:10.012 --> 01:21:13.540
The party's upstairs, sir.
They made me get naked and...

01:21:13.683 --> 01:21:14.411
What?

01:21:14.617 --> 01:21:18.884
They made me get naked and hung me out
from the window. It was so scary and I fell.

01:21:19.056 --> 01:21:21.547
Get a hold of yourself.
What room are they in?

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:25.756
- They're on the tenth floor, sir.
- I'm going up there. I'll take care of this.

01:21:25.864 --> 01:21:29.391
Now you go and get yourself
some clothes. You look awful.

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:30.934
Yes, sir.

01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:39.172
OK, this side 27. This side 17.
Ready? Here we go. Go, go, go!

01:22:00.637 --> 01:22:03.367
How ya doing, everybody?
We brought back a friend.

01:22:05.543 --> 01:22:09.639
Gentlemen, ladies, for your
viewing pleasure, meet Max,

01:22:09.747 --> 01:22:12.216
the magical, sexual mule!

01:22:13.318 --> 01:22:16.185
A donkey that doesn't
wanna be recognized?

01:22:16.355 --> 01:22:19.416
Something interesting
is gonna happen here.

01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:25.525
And here's Max's partner. A gal who doesn't
believe happiness ends with primates.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.468
The lovely Miss Desiree!

01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:13.514
My God! What are you
people doing in here?!

01:23:14.722 --> 01:23:16.747
Uh-oh. It's Mr Laughs.

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:25.231
Rick, I knew you were a vile,
disgusting degenerate,

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:27.562
but bestiality?

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.434
This goes beyond my wildest dreams.

01:23:30.607 --> 01:23:33.008
Well, I like to stretch
myself on occasion.

01:23:35.045 --> 01:23:40.746
You're through, mister. When Debbie hears
about this, she will never see you again.

01:23:41.052 --> 01:23:42.849
You're right, Mr Thompson.

01:23:43.021 --> 01:23:48.187
You should go give Debbie a call right now.
There's a phone in the back bedroom.

01:23:51.798 --> 01:23:53.823
You're through, mister.

01:23:55.369 --> 01:23:57.064
Well, thanks, pal!

01:23:57.237 --> 01:24:00.071
If Debbie finds out
about this, I am dead!

01:24:00.241 --> 01:24:03.802
Will you relax?! I have
everything under control.

01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:06.806
Hired help... ladies... follow me.

01:24:20.031 --> 01:24:24.196
Sorry for the interruption, folks.
We now return you to the arts.

01:25:46.764 --> 01:25:49.062
Stand back! I'm a doctor!

01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:50.188
Back!

01:26:00.179 --> 01:26:03.637
Of course we don't allow that
sort of thing here, ma'am. No.

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:08.346
I'm sorry that the noise woke you up.
I will take care of it right away.

01:26:09.022 --> 01:26:11.082
I've had enough of this.

01:26:25.608 --> 01:26:28.372
- Let's just give 'em what they want.
- What?!

01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:31.103
Let's go. Come on,
everybody inside!

01:26:31.248 --> 01:26:34.706
The big show's gonna start
in one minute. Come on!

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:42.016
We're gonna have so much fun!

01:26:42.661 --> 01:26:44.823
Get outta here! Go! Go!

01:26:45.164 --> 01:26:48.930
Everyone, go! I'll hold them off.
The rest of you make a break for it.

01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:51.366
Ilene, are you crazy?
Come on, let's go!

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:55.670
Debbie, please, I know what
I'm doing. Now just go. Go!

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:07.122
OK, gentlemen, the gods
have answered your prayers!

01:27:07.857 --> 01:27:09.324
Banzai!

01:27:19.837 --> 01:27:24.001
<i>- I hope Ilene is all right.
- I hope those guys are all right.</i>

01:27:25.744 --> 01:27:27.905
- Oh, my God.
- Ohhh!

01:27:28.046 --> 01:27:29.604
Gross!

01:27:37.691 --> 01:27:39.818
1002.

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:31.451
Guess who's here?
Another surprise guest.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.484
Who?

01:28:32.754 --> 01:28:35.518
Does the name Debbie
mean anything to you?

01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:37.523
What, my Debbie?

01:28:38.127 --> 01:28:42.291
- What's with the costume?
- I don't know! Listen, do me a favor.

01:28:42.365 --> 01:28:46.200
Go up to her like you don't know her
and send her into the back bedroom.

01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:48.133
You got it.

01:28:51.376 --> 01:28:54.470
Hi, baby. You're new here.

01:28:55.714 --> 01:29:00.175
- I don't believe the groom has had you yet.
- No, not...

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:04.819
No, not yet. Where is the groom?

01:29:05.158 --> 01:29:06.819
In the bedroom.

01:29:06.994 --> 01:29:08.552
Thanks.

01:29:24.881 --> 01:29:27.008
Hey, it's dark in here.

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.247
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
I'll lead you around.

01:29:31.389 --> 01:29:35.189
Oh, well, a seeing-eye hooker.
This is a nice service.

01:29:36.027 --> 01:29:41.193
Hey, you don't look half bad! Let's
see how you are in the sack! Yeehah!

01:29:45.638 --> 01:29:47.128
Damn you, Rick!

01:29:53.213 --> 01:29:55.647
Debbie, you're a hooker!
I don't believe it!

01:29:55.783 --> 01:29:57.479
I can't trust you!

01:29:58.853 --> 01:30:00.480
Come on. I knew it was you.

01:30:03.324 --> 01:30:04.018
Hey!

01:30:04.226 --> 01:30:08.094
- Rick, you're lying!
- It was a joke! Debbie!

01:30:10.466 --> 01:30:13.027
Wait! Just hold on! Wait!

01:30:13.236 --> 01:30:16.103
Hold on! Please, just give
me a chance to explain!

01:30:16.306 --> 01:30:17.295
Debbie!

01:30:17.742 --> 01:30:18.606
Debbie!

01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:21.142
Debbie, I didn't do anything!

01:30:21.279 --> 01:30:22.507
Well, hardly.

01:30:22.647 --> 01:30:27.517
The marriage is off! You can screw around
with your friends for the rest of your life!

01:30:27.686 --> 01:30:29.813
I don't want that! I want you!

01:30:29.955 --> 01:30:32.618
And I want somebody who
understands commitment!

01:30:32.826 --> 01:30:35.351
I understand commitment!
I love you!

01:30:35.495 --> 01:30:38.897
- I don't believe you.
- You don't? Oh, fine. Good.

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:40.226
Hey! Hey!

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.427
People! Attention, please!

01:30:42.536 --> 01:30:44.026
Shut up!

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.642
Have I had sex with anyone
in this room tonight?

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:51.871
No!

01:30:52.548 --> 01:30:54.914
You're sure about this?

01:30:55.151 --> 01:30:57.210
Yes!

01:30:57.855 --> 01:31:00.449
Fine, good. Resume party.

01:31:04.162 --> 01:31:05.322
Understand?

01:31:05.530 --> 01:31:10.024
Now this isn't your ordinary party crowd
here. There are professionals in here.

01:31:10.168 --> 01:31:12.228
But I didn't want them.

01:31:12.338 --> 01:31:15.102
You... you're the only
one I've ever wanted.

01:31:17.276 --> 01:31:19.040
Do you understand?

01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:20.770
Yeah.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.560
So what do we do about it?

01:31:35.697 --> 01:31:37.255
Let's get naked.

01:31:37.734 --> 01:31:39.292
OK.

01:31:44.642 --> 01:31:46.473
No, Debbie, not that bedroom!

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.846
Daddy?

01:31:52.117 --> 01:31:56.986
All my years as a photographer, I've never
seen such a natural. The camera loves him!

01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:58.555
Grrrrrr!

01:31:59.826 --> 01:32:01.953
Daddy, what are you doing here?

01:32:06.633 --> 01:32:10.730
He says he's having a wonderful time and
thinking of changing his name to Spike.

01:32:11.206 --> 01:32:12.571
Grrrrr!

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:17.502
I've been getting calls all night. God
only knows what they're doing in there.

01:32:17.613 --> 01:32:19.171
Open up! You're under arrest!

01:32:22.017 --> 01:32:23.541
All right, boys, break it in.

01:32:23.686 --> 01:32:26.451
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
I've got the key.

01:32:30.026 --> 01:32:32.120
Let's go! It's a raid!

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:35.155
Whoa! The cops!

01:33:26.258 --> 01:33:27.816
Mom?

01:33:30.562 --> 01:33:32.588
Back exit!

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:37.969
Debbie!

01:33:39.373 --> 01:33:40.772
Debbie!

01:33:44.646 --> 01:33:46.011
Rick!

01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:49.007
Rick!

01:33:49.318 --> 01:33:52.447
Diana Ross is playing next week.
I got three tickets.

01:33:52.555 --> 01:33:54.420
How about Boy George? The Police?

01:33:54.657 --> 01:33:55.749
Oh, hi!

01:33:55.892 --> 01:33:57.382
Oh, no! Not her!

01:33:57.528 --> 01:33:59.519
No! No! Anything but that!

01:33:59.663 --> 01:34:01.426
No, not her! Not her!

01:34:01.598 --> 01:34:04.090
She pees standing up! Not her!

01:34:09.874 --> 01:34:12.867
Stan! You lying dog!

01:34:15.948 --> 01:34:17.940
Hey, wait a minute. Hold it.

01:34:18.118 --> 01:34:21.576
What did you say, Stanley?
What did you say, Stanley?

01:34:21.955 --> 01:34:23.616
What did you say, Stanley?

01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:26.658
You said no hookers!
You said no hookers!

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:29.058
No hookers! No hookers!

01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:32.666
Debbie!

01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:40.073
Where is Debbie? Where is Debbie?

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:48.817
- What are you doing?!
- Debbie, you'll always be mine!

01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.180
Rick!

01:34:50.856 --> 01:34:52.380
Hey, have you seen Debbie?

01:34:52.557 --> 01:34:53.751
Shit! Shit!

01:34:57.797 --> 01:34:59.162
Shit!

01:35:00.633 --> 01:35:03.067
- I thought she was just next to you.
- No.

01:35:06.006 --> 01:35:07.405
Oh, shit!

01:35:12.814 --> 01:35:14.839
Get outta there!

01:35:18.287 --> 01:35:20.915
- Cole!
- You're coming with me!

01:35:22.224 --> 01:35:24.785
God, he's kidnapping her!
Back to the bus!

01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:44.449
Help! Rick!

01:36:21.326 --> 01:36:24.125
Debbie! You're coming in with me!

01:36:26.632 --> 01:36:29.032
Cole, I've had enough.
How about you, huh?

01:36:29.168 --> 01:36:31.228
- Come with me!
- Just give it a rest.

01:36:31.338 --> 01:36:32.430
No!

01:36:32.572 --> 01:36:34.005
Tickets. Hey!

01:36:57.868 --> 01:36:59.893
Tickets? Tickets?

01:37:08.013 --> 01:37:10.641
There's 36 theaters.
They could be anywhere.

01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:12.511
Oh, great.

01:37:12.885 --> 01:37:16.480
- Now what do we do?
- Let's just split up. We'll go this way.

01:37:16.689 --> 01:37:18.248
Ryko!

01:37:19.426 --> 01:37:23.294
I killed the mule! I killed the...

01:37:29.737 --> 01:37:33.003
What is the sense of living?

01:37:38.748 --> 01:37:41.512
I'll take this theater. Ryko,
take the one down there.

01:37:44.755 --> 01:37:46.780
Ooh. Small theater.

01:37:59.339 --> 01:38:00.863
Rick?

01:38:01.007 --> 01:38:02.565
Rick!

01:38:19.295 --> 01:38:21.160
What a realistic effect!

01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:47.085
This is the best 3-D
I've ever seen!

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.285
I've seen better.

01:38:54.735 --> 01:38:55.963
Wow!

01:39:18.263 --> 01:39:23.565
This time I'm gonna do it,
and nobody's gonna stop me.

01:39:38.853 --> 01:39:40.878
Fuck...!

01:40:05.117 --> 01:40:07.779
Do you, Richard Ernesto Gassko,

01:40:08.019 --> 01:40:12.616
take Deborah Julie Thompson
as your lawful wife,

01:40:12.925 --> 01:40:15.485
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

01:40:15.628 --> 01:40:18.427
for better for worse,
for richer for poorer,

01:40:18.599 --> 01:40:23.026
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:25.002
I sure do.

01:40:37.019 --> 01:40:41.650
So by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:40:41.958 --> 01:40:43.983
You may kiss the bride.

01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:50.399
Uh... I'm sorry. It needs
something special here.

01:40:50.568 --> 01:40:52.594
Hold on. Wait.

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:55.936
Oh, God Almighty!

01:40:58.945 --> 01:41:02.540
How about this? Come on, we're
married now. This is perfectly legal.

01:41:03.183 --> 01:41:04.617
Honey!

01:41:04.785 --> 01:41:08.084
Rick, stop it! Get that
thing away from me!

01:41:11.426 --> 01:41:13.451
Come here, Mrs Gassko.

01:41:16.298 --> 01:41:18.893
Step on it, driver. We don't
wanna miss our plane.

01:41:19.068 --> 01:41:20.330
Right.

01:41:20.436 --> 01:41:22.631
Hey, now, Brad...
