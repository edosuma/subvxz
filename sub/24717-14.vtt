WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:05.070
NARRATOR: It is a book
that caused a global sensation.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.973
WILLIAM SHATNER: A book
that says aliens visited Earth

00:08.074 --> 00:10.175
and then helped build
the pyramids

00:10.211 --> 00:11.977
influences the whole world.

00:12.079 --> 00:15.347
NARRATOR: It challenged
everything we thought we knew

00:15.383 --> 00:17.983
about humanity's past.

00:18.085 --> 00:18.984
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

00:19.086 --> 00:22.354
It 100% questioned

00:22.390 --> 00:26.492
orthodox ideas of archaeology.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.961
A lot of people
violently disagree with you...

ERICH VON DANIKEN:
It's absolutely normal

00:30.564 --> 00:32.075
in our society
that I am attacked.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.066
NARRATOR:
But after five decades

00:34.101 --> 00:36.668
of scrutiny and investigation,

00:36.771 --> 00:40.973
how has Erich von Daniken's
controversial theory held up?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.442
MEGAN FOX: We've had people
that have worked at NASA

00:43.477 --> 00:46.011
go on the record saying
that of course they believe

00:46.113 --> 00:47.679
extraterrestrial life exists.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.015

-Wow.

NICK POPE:
Researchers have a whole arsenal

00:57.124 --> 00:58.590

NARRATOR:

WILLIAM HENRY:
We've seen this new generation

01:02.129 --> 01:05.197
of ancient astronaut theorists
bringing new facts

01:05.299 --> 01:06.610
that were
previously unavailable.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.501
NARRATOR:
...and explore what has become

01:09.603 --> 01:11.537
a worldwide phenomenon.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.705
ANNOUNCER:
...Erich von Daniken.

01:13.808 --> 01:16.075
DAVID CHILDRESS:
At no time has there ever been

01:16.110 --> 01:20.012
such a big wave
of people believing

01:20.114 --> 01:21.180
in alien life.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.215
NARRATOR:
It's a special

01:23.317 --> 01:25.217
two-hour <i> Ancient Aliens</i> event.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.587
SHATNER: Von Daniken's theory
is mesmerizing,

01:28.622 --> 01:32.357

NARRATOR:
1968.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.193
It was a year of civil unrest,

02:08.229 --> 02:11.530
colossal
scientific achievement...

02:11.565 --> 02:14.433
and of violent opposition
to a war that seemed

02:14.535 --> 02:17.169
to have no end in sight.

02:17.204 --> 02:20.339
It was a time
when everything was questioned,

02:20.374 --> 02:24.810
and people over 30 were
no longer being trusted.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.481
You had a sociocultural
revolution taking place

02:29.517 --> 02:30.782
during this decade.

civil rights...

02:36.524 --> 02:38.857
and political assassinations.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.397
This was the time
of terrible world tensions.

02:45.432 --> 02:49.635
Nuclear annihilation was
on everyone's minds.

02:49.737 --> 02:54.306
The Soviets had nuclear weapons
and missiles; so did we.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.377
There was tremendous
social and academic change

02:58.412 --> 03:01.513
all over the world,
and particularly in the West.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.882
Young people
were getting their voice.

03:03.918 --> 03:07.686
The status quo that
had come out of World War II,

03:07.721 --> 03:09.821
the controlling of us,

03:09.924 --> 03:12.691
people were rebelling
against that.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.328
So things were
very much changing.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.797
(people whistling)

03:18.899 --> 03:22.868
NARRATOR: In 1962,
America's 35th president,

03:22.903 --> 03:26.738
John F. Kennedy, announced
his nation's ambitious goal

03:26.774 --> 03:29.841
of putting a man on the Moon.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.844
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

03:32.947 --> 03:35.847
and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

03:35.950 --> 03:38.383
but because they are hard.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.652
NARRATOR:
Less than six years

03:40.754 --> 03:43.622
after Kennedy's
audacious proclamation,

03:43.657 --> 03:46.258
a book appeared
on store shelves.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.828
Entitled <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

03:49.930 --> 03:52.431
it threatened to push
the already stretched boundaries

03:52.466 --> 03:56.568
of America's most established
understandings of history...

03:56.604 --> 03:58.870
archaeology...

03:58.973 --> 04:00.172
science...

04:00.274 --> 04:02.207
and religion.

04:02.309 --> 04:05.911
The title... complete with
its enigmatic question mark...

04:05.946 --> 04:09.781
was as compelling
as its inquisitive premise:

04:09.817 --> 04:13.552
Did aliens come to Earth
centuries ago?

04:13.654 --> 04:17.889
Did they leave behind evidence
in the form of pyramids...

04:17.992 --> 04:19.925
monolithic structures...

04:19.959 --> 04:22.294
strange carvings...

04:22.329 --> 04:25.464
and even stranger markings
in the sands?

04:25.499 --> 04:29.468
And, if so, could this notion
help to explain everything

04:29.503 --> 04:33.472
from mankind's origins
to the unsolved mysteries

04:33.507 --> 04:36.742
of the world's
most sacred religions?

04:36.844 --> 04:40.979
GRAHAM: <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>
reinterpreted

04:41.015 --> 04:43.615
ancient historical texts,

04:43.651 --> 04:47.486
religious texts, as evidence
of ancient alien visitation.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.489
It reinterpreted these

04:50.524 --> 04:54.459
as being something that
was not necessarily divine,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.673
but rather something
that was extraterrestrial

04:56.697 --> 05:00.766
nuts-and-bolts technology
from another star system.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.636
NARRATOR: The author
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

05:04.672 --> 05:07.639
appeared to be
as unthreatening and unlikely

05:07.675 --> 05:10.976
as the book's title...
a Swiss hotel manager

05:11.011 --> 05:13.645
by the name
of Erich von Daniken.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.001
VON DANIKEN: When I wrote
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

05:16.050 --> 05:17.994
I was still
the managing director

05:18.018 --> 05:20.552
of a first-class hotel
in Switzerland.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.654
I wrote about my ideas.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.290
This was this
burning fire in me.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.525
I had to write the book.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.827
And now all of a sudden,
the people look

05:28.862 --> 05:31.797
to this hotel manager
completely different.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.567
In the newspaper, for weeks,
they saw my face every day.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.870
Many of the people said,
"I had similar ideas,

05:38.906 --> 05:42.007
but you are the first one
which comes out to public."

05:42.042 --> 05:44.876
NARRATOR: Having already
been published in Germany,

05:44.912 --> 05:49.781
the book caused an instant
sensation in the United States.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.352
Almost overnight,
Erich von Daniken rocketed

05:53.387 --> 05:57.322
from obscurity
to international fame,

05:57.424 --> 06:00.992
and what later became known
as ancient astronaut theory

06:01.095 --> 06:03.829
was officially
on everyone's radar

06:03.931 --> 06:06.832
and in their living rooms.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.400
(audience laughter)

06:08.435 --> 06:10.547
People find this fascinating,
as you know,

06:10.571 --> 06:11.837
and a lot of people, uh...

06:11.939 --> 06:13.583
probably violently
disagree with you

06:13.607 --> 06:15.674
and think this is all
a lot of hogwash

06:15.776 --> 06:18.643
and it sounds good and
it's interesting to talk about,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.345
but there's really no, uh,

06:20.447 --> 06:21.847
what they call hard-core...

06:21.949 --> 06:25.016
As you know,
I have presented my books

06:25.119 --> 06:28.687
in a very provocative,
in a very explosive way,

06:28.789 --> 06:31.556
and, uh, so it's
absolutely normal in our society

06:31.592 --> 06:33.091
that I am attacked.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.793
Why should it <i> not</i> be like this?

06:34.828 --> 06:37.629
-So, but it...
-Any new... any new theories

06:37.664 --> 06:39.865
usually are, are they not,
if they're far out

06:39.967 --> 06:41.111
-and far-reaching?
-Yeah.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.868
People immediately say, "No way."

06:42.970 --> 06:44.614
It's impossible, it's crazy,"
and so forth.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.972
-You know Schopenhauer?
-Not personally.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.085
-But I... But yes.
The philosopher? -Yeah.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.576
-Yes. -He said something.
Each new theory

06:51.612 --> 06:55.514
who finally has bloomed
has three stages to run.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.616
The first stage,
everybody laughs.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.951
It's nonsense, crackpot,
forget about it.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.686
In the second stage, uh,

07:01.789 --> 07:04.055
people don't want to speak
about it anymore.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.892
And in the third stage,
the whole world says, "Oh, that?"

07:06.994 --> 07:08.460
We always said it."

07:08.495 --> 07:12.431
POPE:
<i>Chariots of the Gods?</i> led

07:12.466 --> 07:16.101
to a fundamental rethink
about our history,

07:16.136 --> 07:20.105
our origins and, indeed,
our place in the cosmos.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.942
The idea that our ancient gods

07:23.977 --> 07:26.445
might not be deities at all,

07:26.480 --> 07:32.050
but extraterrestrial visitors,
was a game changer.

07:32.152 --> 07:36.822
I mean, it absolutely turned
the orthodoxy on its head

07:36.857 --> 07:40.892
and opened people up
to whole new ways of thinking.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.428
RAMY ROMANY: I believe
that <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

07:43.530 --> 07:45.730
was one of the most impactful

07:45.833 --> 07:50.035
and most intriguing publications
in the modern history.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.504
It was full of questions,

07:52.539 --> 07:54.439
and that was the big difference.

07:54.541 --> 07:59.010
The questions
made people seek an answer.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.682
My dad was a machinist

08:03.717 --> 08:06.618
on the Saturn Vs
that went to the Moon.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.554
And when he read
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

08:09.590 --> 08:11.423
I think it excited him,

08:11.525 --> 08:15.627
and he knew that it
might also spark something in me

08:15.729 --> 08:18.797
to do my own type of thinking,
my own investigation.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.967
And my dad always wanted me
to not take people's word

08:22.069 --> 08:24.047
for things,
to go figure it out for myself.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.471
And it is one of the reasons
I became a scientist.

08:26.573 --> 08:30.609
MICHAEL DENNIN: It was able
to take stories and myths

08:30.711 --> 08:33.712
and suggest that there was
something real behind it.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.514
I found that fascinating.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.559
And thinking this way
back in the '70s

08:37.583 --> 08:39.596
helped motivate
and push science a little bit

08:39.620 --> 08:41.563
to think about things
differently.

08:41.587 --> 08:45.624
SHATNER: I would think
that von Daniken's theory

08:45.726 --> 08:47.826
of ancient aliens

08:47.928 --> 08:50.061
appeals to our sense of mystery.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.177
Because we're curious.
What's out there?

08:52.266 --> 08:54.833
What's under there?
What's next?

08:54.935 --> 08:58.069
NARRATOR: But as popular
as <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

08:58.105 --> 09:00.205
proved to be
with the book-buying public,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.641
it was also...
perhaps not surprisingly...

09:02.743 --> 09:05.510
almost entirely dismissed

09:05.612 --> 09:07.846
by members
of the academic community.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.814
CHILDRESS:
The early reaction

09:09.917 --> 09:11.483
to <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

09:11.585 --> 09:15.220
especially from the academics,
was one of disgust.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.924
In the late '60s and early '70s,

09:18.959 --> 09:22.961
it was a time when everyone
just listened to the experts.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.829
And Erich was

09:24.932 --> 09:27.532
really just torn to bits.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.602
People attacked his character.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.872
They attacked
his research and methods.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.942
They just didn't like
what was in that book.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.879
Of course I was attacked.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.715
After <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>
first I was crushed down,

09:43.817 --> 09:46.217
more or less by
the whole scientific community.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.788
Everyone said, "He's crazy.
What is he talking about?"

09:49.823 --> 09:51.601
And then
some other critics said,

09:51.625 --> 09:53.124
"Well, he's just a waiter,"

09:53.160 --> 09:55.794
because I came
from the hotel business,

09:55.829 --> 09:58.597
so, "How can he come up
with these kind of ideas?"

09:58.632 --> 10:00.098
"Don't believe him.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.233
He's just
a science fiction author."

10:04.004 --> 10:06.571
NARRATOR: What was lost
on many of the book's critics

10:06.673 --> 10:09.274
was the fact
that von Daniken never claimed

10:09.309 --> 10:12.277
to be an archaeologist
or historian.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.846
Instead, he wrote
<i>Chariots of the Gods?</i>

10:14.881 --> 10:18.283
from the perspective
of a curious citizen,

10:18.318 --> 10:20.752
one who posed
compelling questions,

10:20.854 --> 10:23.922
but did not presume
to supply the answers.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.659
VON DANIKEN: In the book,
I had 238 questions.

10:27.694 --> 10:32.964
Now, I was not absolutely sure
that in every point,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.966
in every object, I was correct.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.835
I could have been wrong,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.990
and there could be
other possible answers.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.273
But I was sure
I am on the right track.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.846
NARRATOR: But while those in the
mainstream academic community

10:47.881 --> 10:51.182
were busily trying to tear
von Daniken's book apart,

10:51.218 --> 10:55.620
the general public found
that they could not put it down.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.189
CHILDRESS: To lay people
who were buying his books,

10:58.225 --> 11:01.960
they were interested
in what his questions were,

11:02.062 --> 11:04.262
and things changed after that.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.632
ROMANY:
Everyone needed an answer

11:07.734 --> 11:10.335
to all the questions
that the book was giving,

11:10.370 --> 11:12.003
and everyone became involved.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.006
Everyone became a part
of the search.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.009
And that opened up
modern science,

11:18.045 --> 11:20.311
and that opened up
modern archeology,

11:20.414 --> 11:23.648
because as a young Egyptologist,

11:23.750 --> 11:26.217
as a young archeologist,
having a book like that

11:26.253 --> 11:29.988
made me think not everything
has to be set in stone.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.391
I can think outside of the box.

11:33.427 --> 11:37.829
SHATNER: What I think
von Daniken's thesis has done

11:37.931 --> 11:43.001
is add imagination and wonder
to the world,

11:43.103 --> 11:45.937
given the mystery of space,

11:45.972 --> 11:49.708
that everything is possible.

11:49.743 --> 11:54.813
TSOUKALOS: It was
the first book that challenged

11:54.915 --> 11:58.249
the orthodox ideas
of archaeology

11:58.285 --> 12:00.952
that actually caught traction.

12:00.987 --> 12:04.723
And it became one
of the most popular books

12:04.758 --> 12:06.991
in the history of publishing.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.260
I mean, that first run,

12:09.296 --> 12:12.363
six million copies was sold out
in three weeks

12:12.466 --> 12:15.200
or something crazy like this.

12:15.302 --> 12:19.037
NARRATOR: For a culture
at war with itself,

12:19.139 --> 12:21.673
<i>Chariots of the Gods?</i>
posed the questions

12:21.775 --> 12:25.944
that most people were thinking
but too afraid to ask.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.447
Questions that seemed well-timed
for a world

12:29.483 --> 12:32.450
that was about to land a man
on the Moon.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.959
NARRATOR:
In April 2018,

12:40.994 --> 12:44.796
editor and ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

12:44.831 --> 12:49.067
joined his longtime friend
and mentor, Erich von Daniken,

12:49.169 --> 12:51.402
in Fribourg, Switzerland.

12:51.505 --> 12:54.572
They came to visit
the Collège Saint-Michel,

12:54.674 --> 12:58.176
the Jesuit school that Erich
attended as a young boy.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.944
It was here,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.846
more than seven decades ago,

13:01.882 --> 13:04.916
that von Daniken first began
to ask the questions

13:05.018 --> 13:07.585
that would forever change
his life.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.622
Home, Giorgio.

13:10.724 --> 13:14.492
-Wow.
-This is the holy place.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.495
-This is where it all begins.
-This is beautiful.

13:17.531 --> 13:22.100
VON DANIKEN: Imagine a young man
praying every day

13:22.202 --> 13:24.869
at least a half an hour
in that church.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.138
You see...

13:27.240 --> 13:29.774
I was watching these ceilings.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.576
Look up there.

13:31.611 --> 13:35.480
TSOUKALOS: Some of the paintings
are really gorgeous.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.816
I mean, with the rays
and the people

13:37.918 --> 13:39.784
descending from the sky.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.786
Very interesting.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.200
VON DANIKEN: It is absolutely
impressive here, really.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.991
And now at the moment
I still have the same feeling

13:47.093 --> 13:49.127
as I had as a 17-year-old.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.463
-Look up there.
-Wow.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.134
All the saints in heaven.
And here I learned

13:56.236 --> 13:59.137
for the first time
that there was a war in heaven.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.539
You know, when I was a boy,
they told me

14:01.575 --> 14:02.907
when you came in heaven,

14:02.943 --> 14:05.054
heaven is the place
of absolute happiness.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.812
In heaven
you are united with God.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.914
If you are happy,
united with God,

14:09.950 --> 14:12.517
then there is no war,
no opposition.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.985
That's what confuses me.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.098
That's how it all started here.
Something was wrong

14:16.122 --> 14:18.223
in my own religious belief here.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.492
TSOUKALOS: So, did you have
any fellow students

14:21.595 --> 14:24.195
that were classmates
that were interested

14:24.297 --> 14:25.808
in the things
that all of a sudden

14:25.832 --> 14:27.610
you were like,
"Hey, look at this.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.945
-What do you think?"
-Well, of course, you know.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.535
I was always... even as a boy...

14:30.637 --> 14:32.770
I was a so-called alpha animal.

14:32.806 --> 14:36.074
I was always the leading one.
They were listening to me.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.611
Of course, the strong believers
want to have

14:39.646 --> 14:42.680
nothing to do
with Erich's crazy ideas.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.782
But I had these thoughts
in my mind

14:44.818 --> 14:47.085
where I was kneeling here,
and I said

14:47.120 --> 14:48.553
my God was omnipotent.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.188
My God did not need a vehicle

14:50.290 --> 14:52.957
to move from one point "A"
to point "B."

14:52.993 --> 14:56.794
My God was all over,
so all this was confusing.

14:56.830 --> 15:00.064
And it all started
in this church here.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.134
So, amongst your teachers,
did you have a Jesuit priest

15:03.169 --> 15:06.304
who said, "Erich, you know,
if you're interested in this",

15:06.339 --> 15:09.841
-you should go and read this or that"?
-Exactly.

15:09.876 --> 15:13.244
These Jesuit priests
were absolutely not orthodox.

15:13.346 --> 15:17.048
They were absolutely friendly
and helpful.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.249
I remember one,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.919
I talked to him
about my thoughts,

15:21.021 --> 15:22.999
and he said,
"Erich, you should read Enoch."

15:23.023 --> 15:25.256
NARRATOR:
Believed to have been written

15:25.358 --> 15:28.092
by Jewish mystics
in the third century BC,

15:28.194 --> 15:30.595
the Book of Enoch

15:30.697 --> 15:32.341
tells the story
of the archangel Michael

15:32.365 --> 15:34.966
coming to Earth
to take the mortal Enoch

15:35.001 --> 15:38.336
into the heavenly realms.

15:38.371 --> 15:44.008
Once there,
Enoch is educated by the angels.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.354
Enoch is taken up
to the highest,

15:45.378 --> 15:46.822
which is the commander
in spaceship

15:46.846 --> 15:48.079
of the extraterrestrials,

15:48.181 --> 15:50.949
and he learned engineering
and astronomy

15:51.051 --> 15:53.184
from the extraterrestrials.

15:53.219 --> 15:57.121
The commander said,
"Some of our people

15:57.223 --> 16:01.960
"had sex with humans,
and they created giants.

16:02.062 --> 16:06.998
"And we have to destroy humanity
with these giants,

16:07.033 --> 16:09.634
and we can do it
only by a great flood."

16:09.736 --> 16:13.004
The great flood was created

16:13.039 --> 16:15.106
by extraterrestrials on purpose.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.676
In all mythologies,
including the Bible,

16:18.712 --> 16:22.313
some gods are coming down
and teach the human,

16:22.415 --> 16:25.249
"A great flood will come
and destroy you."

16:25.285 --> 16:28.286
And these gods,

16:28.388 --> 16:29.988
they knew it long before,

16:30.090 --> 16:32.690
and they knew it
because they themselves

16:32.726 --> 16:34.292
made the great flood.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.695
NARRATOR:
Because the Book of Enoch

16:37.731 --> 16:39.709
was edited out
of the traditional Bible

16:39.733 --> 16:42.100
sometime in the fourth century,

16:42.135 --> 16:45.703
it is considered to be
too far-fetched to be credible

16:45.739 --> 16:47.405
by most people of faith.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.874
But to a young
Erich von Daniken,

16:49.909 --> 16:52.844
the Book of Enoch
represented a gateway

16:52.946 --> 16:56.647
into a world of hidden
and forbidden knowledge.

16:56.750 --> 17:00.218
VON DANIKEN:
After I read Enoch,

17:00.253 --> 17:03.054
I felt myself like an explorer

17:03.089 --> 17:06.357
who goes into a jungle
and sees new flowers.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.959
I said, if Enoch is correct,

17:07.993 --> 17:09.739
then there must be
more information

17:09.762 --> 17:13.664
of old writers, old historian,
so I was always looking,

17:13.767 --> 17:15.411
and there was more
and more coming.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.667
Then this fire in me said,

17:17.771 --> 17:20.204
"Erich, don't write about things
which you don't know.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.205
"Go there, touch them,

17:22.308 --> 17:24.876
smell them,
speak to the people."

17:24.978 --> 17:28.780
I was absolutely sure
not only in my feelings,

17:28.815 --> 17:30.381
but in my knowledge.

17:30.483 --> 17:35.353
I was on the right track,
so I was fighting for it.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.722
So you were never
an armchair researcher.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.724
You were an explorer.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.426
Absolutely, I was an explorer.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.028
One of my best friends
was an Egyptian,

17:44.130 --> 17:47.865
and he invited me...
I was 18 and a half years old...

17:47.967 --> 17:49.901
to Egypt for three weeks.

17:50.003 --> 17:53.104
Climbing up the pyramids,
being under the pyramid

17:53.139 --> 17:55.840
in Saqqara in the Serapeum,
etcetera.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.076
So I knew all this
from a young man.

17:58.178 --> 18:02.847
Of course, I visited in Egypt
the Great Pyramid,

18:02.882 --> 18:05.716
and it impressed me
very, very much.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.452
I always have the feeling

18:07.487 --> 18:11.422
this is not only done by humans.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.792
Especially in Egyptology,
many archeologists,

18:14.828 --> 18:17.361
they believe
that they know everything.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.998
In reality, there are thousands
of open questions,

18:21.034 --> 18:23.301
starting with the builder
of the Great Pyramid.

18:23.336 --> 18:27.105
NARRATOR: Exhilarated
by his trip to Egypt,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.973
Erich spent the next decade

18:29.008 --> 18:33.344
traveling to all of the sites
he'd read about as a boy.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.781
But rather than examining
megalithic structures

18:36.883 --> 18:38.216
and strange carvings

18:38.251 --> 18:41.085
from a traditional,
academic perspective,

18:41.187 --> 18:44.021
he looked at the world
through the eyes of someone

18:44.057 --> 18:48.259
who was open
to bold, new interpretations.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.128
I was not just a young man

18:50.230 --> 18:52.497
jumping
to some archeological place.

18:52.532 --> 18:57.034
Before I went there,
I read the archeological book.

18:57.070 --> 19:01.839
Then I had to go out there,
speak to the people,

19:01.875 --> 19:04.842
ask for their mythology,
for their explanation.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.522
And only when all this
came together,

19:06.546 --> 19:09.981
the scientific information
and the personal information,

19:10.083 --> 19:11.315
then I write about it.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.886
Archeology
is not an exact science.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.521
It's a science

19:16.556 --> 19:19.991
where you assemble things,
and then you make out your mind.

19:20.093 --> 19:23.161
That was my way to try to do it.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.530
NARRATOR:
In Peru,

19:25.565 --> 19:28.833
von Daniken investigated
the famous Nazca Lines,

19:28.935 --> 19:32.003
giant lines and symbols etched
into the Earth

19:32.105 --> 19:37.041
that can only be properly viewed
from high above the ground.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.977
I read about Nazca
in the newspaper.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.380
And I saw a first picture,
only one picture,

19:42.415 --> 19:44.382
which showed a line
in the desert.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.084
Nazca was not known at all
to the public.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.087
So I said, "What is this?
You have to go there."

19:50.123 --> 19:53.324
I suggested
in <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

19:53.426 --> 19:57.361
it has something to do
with the extraterrestrials.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.530
In my opinion, our ancestor made

19:59.632 --> 20:01.477
these gigantic signs
in the ground

20:01.501 --> 20:04.902
because they want to signalize
to the beings up there,

20:04.938 --> 20:08.472
"We are here. Come down here."

20:11.477 --> 20:13.945
NARRATOR:
After each trip,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.947
Erich returned
to his regular job

20:15.982 --> 20:19.584
as the manager of a hotel
in Davos, Switzerland.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.887
Once there, he would save
every franc he earned

20:22.989 --> 20:25.590
in order to finance
his next trips.

20:25.625 --> 20:29.393
Eventually,
his globe-trotting paid off

20:29.495 --> 20:32.530
in the form of Erich's
first best-selling book,

20:32.632 --> 20:35.967
<i>Chariots of the Gods?</i>

20:36.002 --> 20:39.136
Did you ever imagine
that your ideas

20:39.172 --> 20:43.507
would become so big
over the decades?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.076
No, not at all.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.323
And in the beginning,
I found no publisher.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.080
Nobody wanted to publish it.

20:49.182 --> 20:52.583
20 publishers rejected it,
and, then, that's another story.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.919
Finally,
the book was on the market.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.622
I was never thinking that this
would create a world...

20:57.657 --> 21:00.424
a storm around the world
of controversy.

21:00.526 --> 21:03.461
Well, this is
incredibly special,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.474
and I feel very honored
that you brought me here,

21:05.498 --> 21:09.300
because this, uh,
this is something else.

21:09.335 --> 21:12.003
The beginning
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i> here.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.572
NARRATOR:
With the publication

21:14.674 --> 21:17.241
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>
in 1968,

21:17.343 --> 21:21.946
what began as the bold notions
of a curious schoolboy

21:22.048 --> 21:24.415
was about to create
a paradigm shift

21:24.517 --> 21:27.652
in the way mankind
would view the universe.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.721
There would be no turning back.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.460
NARRATOR:
June 20, 1969.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.030
(beeping)

21:41.067 --> 21:42.344
MAN:
Okay, Neil,

21:42.368 --> 21:44.935
we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.158
NARRATOR: American astronaut
Neil Armstrong

21:47.240 --> 21:50.007
becomes the first human
in recorded history

21:50.043 --> 21:52.376
to set foot
on an astronomical body

21:52.412 --> 21:54.512
other than Planet Earth.

22:02.255 --> 22:05.056
NARRATOR:
With one small step,

22:05.091 --> 22:09.493
he becomes our planet's first
official extraterrestrial.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.295
Within an instant,

22:11.397 --> 22:14.131
fanciful notions of aliens
and spaceships

22:14.233 --> 22:17.935
became a sobering reality.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.537
When it happened,

22:19.572 --> 22:24.408
the entire planet erupted
in just absolute ecstasy.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.043
♪ ♪

22:26.079 --> 22:28.512
It was a huge moment

22:28.614 --> 22:30.014
for the human spirit.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.226
It was considered a victory

22:31.250 --> 22:33.551
for all of humanity.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.888
Suddenly,
science fiction became real,

22:37.924 --> 22:42.560
and it opened up
a new age of exploration.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.862
And this prompted many
to question whether or not

22:44.964 --> 22:46.464
we were, in fact, the first

22:46.499 --> 22:49.266
to step on the surface
of the Moon or not.

22:49.302 --> 22:54.038
NARRATOR: Science fiction
had now become science fact.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.408
And books like Erich von
Daniken's <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

22:57.443 --> 22:59.377
though no less controversial,

22:59.479 --> 23:03.547
were gaining wider acceptance
with the general public.

23:03.649 --> 23:08.085
The book also took on
an almost cult status,

23:08.121 --> 23:11.555
with eventual printings
in more than 28 languages.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.635
CHILDRESS: I was in high school
at the time.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.227
And one of the things I liked
was that he was looking

23:16.329 --> 23:20.064
at ancient sites from a
completely different perspective

23:20.166 --> 23:22.099
than other historians.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.135
And here they were,

23:24.170 --> 23:26.437
uh, images of extraterrestrials,

23:26.472 --> 23:29.173
mysterious giant walls.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.876
And I wanted
to go see them myself.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.989
HENRY: I remember looking
through that book

23:34.013 --> 23:36.180
and instantly connecting
with the images.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.993
There was something
very familiar

23:38.017 --> 23:40.117
about some of the pictures
that he showed

23:40.153 --> 23:43.020
of the ancient aliens
on cave walls.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.889
I was instantly hooked.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.558
Since the 1970s,
we've seen a major explosion

23:47.660 --> 23:49.293
in interest in this area.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.496
FOX: I learned
about <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

23:52.532 --> 23:54.432
and it blew my mind.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.100
It resonated with me so deeply.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.235
It just sank in
as a truth for me.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.182
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
That book,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.406
it gave us all permission
to talk

24:02.508 --> 24:05.910
about extraterrestrials
coming to Earth

24:06.012 --> 24:09.313
and that there could be
other explanations

24:09.348 --> 24:14.218
for biblical and religious
literature than angels.

24:14.253 --> 24:18.222
TSOUKALOS: My grandmother
was incredibly open-minded.

24:18.257 --> 24:22.126
And instead of reading
ordinary bedtime stories to me,

24:22.228 --> 24:24.962
she would read <i> Chariots</i>
<i>of the Gods?</i> sometimes.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.298
But I was five, six,
seven years old,

24:27.400 --> 24:31.101
so she is the one
that actually planted the seed.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.970
To all of a sudden suggest

24:33.072 --> 24:36.207
that contact
with extraterrestrials

24:36.242 --> 24:39.276
may have happened
in our remote past,

24:39.378 --> 24:42.046
that was revolutionary.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.982
NARRATOR:
In 1970,

24:45.084 --> 24:48.419
Sun Classic Pictures released
a feature-length documentary

24:48.454 --> 24:50.988
based on von Daniken's book.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.568
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

24:52.592 --> 24:54.992
the international best seller
by Erich von Daniken

24:55.094 --> 24:56.405
that shattered
conventional theories

24:56.429 --> 24:58.662
about history and archaeology.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.665
Now Sun International
brings it to the screen

25:01.767 --> 25:03.300
in a startling new film.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.380
NARRATOR:
Originally produced in Germany,

25:05.404 --> 25:07.538
the American language version
of the film

25:07.573 --> 25:09.673
became the ninth
highest grossing movie

25:09.775 --> 25:11.742
in North America that year,

25:11.777 --> 25:15.412
an incredible achievement
for a documentary.

25:15.448 --> 25:19.617
It was even nominated
for an Oscar.

25:19.652 --> 25:23.187
GRAHAM: This was hugely, hugely
popular when it was released.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.400
The impact of that documentary
can't be understated,

25:25.424 --> 25:26.590
nor of the book.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.159
The notion
of ancient alien visitation

25:29.262 --> 25:32.196
went from being discussed
on the fringes,

25:32.298 --> 25:35.232
uh, within
the ufological subculture

25:35.268 --> 25:36.578
to being something
that was discussed

25:36.602 --> 25:39.003
around the water cooler
at work, for example.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.338
NARRATOR:
But while many believed

25:41.440 --> 25:43.674
that Erich von Daniken
had introduced them

25:43.776 --> 25:46.377
to a new way
of interpreting humanity's past,

25:46.479 --> 25:49.413
there were others, particularly
those in the religious

25:49.448 --> 25:51.782
and academic communities,

25:51.817 --> 25:54.118
who believed <i> Chariots</i>
<i>of the Gods?</i> was an attack

25:54.153 --> 25:57.621
on established spiritual
and archaeological narratives.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.457
They criticized
von Daniken's methods

26:00.493 --> 26:02.593
and brutally dismissed his book

26:02.628 --> 26:05.563
as nothing more
than pseudoscience.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.265
If you think of these claims,

26:08.301 --> 26:11.302
if only they were true, they
would be amazingly interesting,

26:11.337 --> 26:14.305
that we have been visited
by beings from elsewhere

26:14.340 --> 26:17.675
who not only have created
our civilization for us

26:17.710 --> 26:20.411
but mated with human beings.

26:20.513 --> 26:24.081
It's, in my view, much more
likely to successfully mate

26:24.183 --> 26:26.417
with a petunia
than an extraterrestrial.

26:26.519 --> 26:29.587
NARRATOR:
But, to the surprise of many,

26:29.689 --> 26:32.256
von Daniken was not offended
by his critics.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.592
Instead, he welcomed them.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.727
He believed
that his book was meant

26:36.829 --> 26:38.596
to ask profound questions,

26:38.698 --> 26:40.497
not give answers.

26:40.533 --> 26:43.534
Criticism, especially
constructive criticism,

26:43.569 --> 26:46.537
he argued, would make
his findings stronger

26:46.572 --> 26:49.273
and even more convincing.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.774
In Delhi, in India,

26:50.876 --> 26:53.277
there is a temple
and there is an iron pillar.

26:53.379 --> 26:56.547
I was there
as a 22-year old man,

26:56.582 --> 26:59.450
and this iron pillar
did not rust.

26:59.552 --> 27:02.219
I was touching it,
and the local priest said,

27:02.254 --> 27:04.488
"This is here since centuries
and centuries

27:04.523 --> 27:06.824
and there's not rust,"
so I speculated

27:06.859 --> 27:08.425
in <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

27:08.527 --> 27:11.562
maybe it's
an extraterrestrial connection.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.198
In the meantime,
this damn thing is rusting.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.666
So what can you do?

27:15.701 --> 27:18.802
You-you were simply wrong,
so you accept this.

27:18.904 --> 27:22.406
I was too young.
I was not self-critical enough.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.576
I had to learn that sometime
the critics were right

27:25.611 --> 27:27.111
and I was wrong,

27:27.213 --> 27:30.214
but that's a process
of learning.

27:30.249 --> 27:34.351
Given the mystery of space
and the...

27:34.387 --> 27:38.455
fantastic things that we're
beginning to see in quantum,

27:38.557 --> 27:40.324
everything is possible.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.826
There's so much that is bizarre

27:42.928 --> 27:45.629
that we can
scientifically examine.

27:45.731 --> 27:48.532
I mean, we're trying
to find an explanation

27:48.567 --> 27:51.669
why the universe is expanding
when it should be contracting,

27:51.771 --> 27:54.738
and we apply some theory to it.

27:54.774 --> 27:59.276
Why not have ancient aliens
come to Earth

27:59.311 --> 28:01.278
and build the pyramids,

28:01.313 --> 28:04.314
even though it's bizarre.

28:04.417 --> 28:05.849
Bizarre is good,

28:05.951 --> 28:10.254
uh, because it stirs us up.

28:11.624 --> 28:14.892
FOX:
I think people resist

28:14.927 --> 28:18.228
anything that challenges the
current paradigm quite often.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.298
And people also don't want
their life's work challenged.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.278
So if someone
is that person who's put forth

28:23.302 --> 28:24.601
the theory that's been accepted,

28:24.637 --> 28:26.748
they don't want you
to take that from them

28:26.772 --> 28:28.405
by producing new evidence.

28:28.441 --> 28:29.951
NARRATOR:
Ironically,

28:29.975 --> 28:32.743
one of von Daniken's
most ardent defenders

28:32.778 --> 28:36.380
started out as one
of his most outspoken critics.

28:36.482 --> 28:41.251
While making a presentation
in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1972,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.787
von Daniken relayed his theory

28:43.823 --> 28:45.756
that the Bible's
Book of Ezekiel,

28:45.791 --> 28:48.759
rather than describing
an encounter with an angel,

28:48.794 --> 28:53.297
was actually the story of
an extraterrestrial visitation.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.268
In the account,
the prophet Ezekiel

28:58.304 --> 29:02.906
describes a flying chariot
drawn by four living creatures.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.709
Each creature is flanked
by a metallic object,

29:05.811 --> 29:07.745
a wheel within a wheel,

29:07.847 --> 29:10.414
that Ezekiel observes
as it descends,

29:10.516 --> 29:13.484
making a tremendous amount
of noise.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.756
During his speech,

29:18.858 --> 29:20.991
Erich talked about Ezekiel

29:21.026 --> 29:23.260
and the wheel that he witnessed

29:23.362 --> 29:28.599
and also that he was taken up
in this "glory of the Lord,"

29:28.701 --> 29:31.001
as it is described in the Bible,

29:31.036 --> 29:35.472
and likened it
to a type of spaceship.

29:35.508 --> 29:39.476
NARRATOR: In the audience was
NASA engineer Josef Blumrich,

29:39.512 --> 29:41.478
who conducted design research

29:41.514 --> 29:44.515
for the Saturn V rocket
and Skylab.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.517
As a spacecraft designer,

29:46.552 --> 29:48.986
he was certain
that he could easily refute

29:49.021 --> 29:51.955
this interpretation
of Ezekiel's wheel.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.625
TSOUKALOS: After the lecture,
Blumrich goes up to Erich

29:54.727 --> 29:56.994
and he says,
"You know, this was interesting,

29:57.029 --> 29:58.796
"but I will defy you.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.365
"I will go
and read the Bible tonight

30:01.400 --> 30:03.000
"and I will then write a thesis

30:03.035 --> 30:06.937
how what you said tonight
is total nonsense."

30:07.039 --> 30:09.706
NARRATOR:
But after painstaking research,

30:09.742 --> 30:12.609
Blumrich was shocked
to find himself agreeing

30:12.711 --> 30:14.945
with Erich von Daniken.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.648
He became convinced
that the Book of Ezekiel

30:17.750 --> 30:20.684
was indeed describing
some sort of spacecraft,

30:20.719 --> 30:23.854
and he was able to design
a practical landing module

30:23.889 --> 30:27.958
using the description
found in the biblical texts.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.327
In 1974,

30:30.429 --> 30:32.496
he published his findings
in his book

30:32.598 --> 30:35.999
<i>The Spaceships of Ezekiel.</i>

30:36.101 --> 30:39.503
Now, what's so fascinating
is that, to this day,

30:39.605 --> 30:42.539
Blumrich and NASA hold a patent

30:42.575 --> 30:45.709
for an omnidirectional wheel,

30:45.744 --> 30:48.912
a wheel
that actually goes forward

30:48.948 --> 30:51.081
and also goes sideways

30:51.116 --> 30:55.552
without having
to have a steering movement.

30:55.588 --> 30:58.488
The omnidirectional wheel
is a common technology

30:58.591 --> 31:01.458
used today
in many, many forklifts,

31:01.493 --> 31:06.396
because it allows you
to get underneath the product

31:06.432 --> 31:10.834
without having to move
in a obstructive way.

31:10.936 --> 31:13.737
And the omnidirectional wheel
today exists

31:13.772 --> 31:17.507
because of
an Old Testament reference

31:17.610 --> 31:22.145
that Blumrich found in none
other than the Book of Ezekiel.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.916
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theory

31:25.951 --> 31:30.554
had found its first champion
in the scientific community.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.890
But perhaps even more impactful

31:32.992 --> 31:34.658
would be the author's influence

31:34.693 --> 31:37.561
on a younger
and more open-minded generation

31:37.663 --> 31:41.365
of scholars, intellectuals
and creative artists.

31:41.467 --> 31:45.502
A creative community
that included filmmakers

31:45.537 --> 31:47.804
who would soon create
the most influential

31:47.840 --> 31:54.344
and successful science fiction
films of all time.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.981
NARRATOR:
1975 saw the publication

31:58.083 --> 32:00.784
of Erich von Daniken's
fifth best-selling book,

32:00.886 --> 32:03.020
<i>Miracles of the Gods,</i>

32:03.055 --> 32:05.289
in which
the increasingly prolific author

32:05.424 --> 32:08.892
examines miracles
and other paranormal phenomena

32:08.928 --> 32:11.461
through the prism
of what was now being called

32:11.563 --> 32:13.497
ancient astronaut theory.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.699
The success of the book led

32:15.734 --> 32:18.802
to yet another
cinematic adaptation.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.671
Originally produced in Germany,

32:20.773 --> 32:24.341
<i>Mysteries of the Gods</i>
was hosted by William Shatner.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.344
As Captain Kirk,
and with the rest of the crew

32:27.446 --> 32:30.647
of the USS <i> Enterprise,</i>
we made many wondrous voyages

32:30.783 --> 32:33.016
into the future,
but that was fiction.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.430
I'd like to take you along
on another kind of voyage,

32:35.454 --> 32:37.321
but this is based on reality.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.434
NARRATOR:
Like <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:42.492
it chronicled many of von
Daniken's more recent topics,

32:42.628 --> 32:46.496
including crystal skulls,
tribal rituals

32:46.632 --> 32:48.999
and UFO encounters.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.368
What is NASA's opinion

32:51.470 --> 32:53.870
of the possibility
of life in outer space?

32:53.973 --> 32:57.074
We have concluded that, uh, you
can create life-building blocks

32:57.109 --> 32:59.069
in the laboratory,
which could mean

32:59.111 --> 33:01.778
that it's just as easy
out in the universe.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.792
Do you think
extraterrestrial beings

33:03.816 --> 33:05.916
could have come here
5,000 years ago?

33:05.951 --> 33:07.617
Definitely possible.

33:07.653 --> 33:12.789
Being part of that film
and reading the book,

33:12.825 --> 33:17.094
I would think
that von Daniken's theory

33:17.129 --> 33:22.065
of ancient aliens also represent
a yearning for somebody higher,

33:22.167 --> 33:25.535
a daddy figure
to take care of us.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.637
(theme to <i> Star Wars</i> plays)

33:29.174 --> 33:31.808
NARRATOR:
May 25, 1977.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.485
in a galactic rebellion.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.522
Now I am the master.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.724
Only a master of evil, Darth.

blow this thing and go home.

Its impact...

NARRATOR: But among the elements
that make the movie

34:43.715 --> 34:46.683
and its equally successful
sequels distinctive

34:46.717 --> 34:49.518
from previous science fiction
offerings is the line

34:49.554 --> 34:53.123
that greets audiences
at the very start of the film:

34:58.730 --> 35:02.866
It is a line that could have
only made sense to people

35:02.901 --> 35:06.203
who were familiar with Erich von
Daniken's <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

35:06.238 --> 35:08.171
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Science fiction

35:08.273 --> 35:11.475
up to that time had always been
things happening in the future.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.710
But when <i> Star Wars</i> came out,
suddenly,

35:13.745 --> 35:16.680
here was science fiction
happening in the remote past.

35:16.715 --> 35:20.484
This was exactly what Erich
von Daniken was writing about

35:20.586 --> 35:22.486
in <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

35:22.588 --> 35:24.588
♪ ♪

35:26.792 --> 35:29.759

<i>Star Wars'</i> phenomenal success

35:29.795 --> 35:32.028
was a small-screen
space adventure

35:32.131 --> 35:34.731
that owed even more
to von Daniken's vision.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.867

35:38.604 --> 35:41.171
NARRATOR:
Released to television in 1978,

35:41.306 --> 35:44.241
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
told the story of a group

35:44.276 --> 35:47.944
of extraterrestrial exiles
looking for a promised land.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.580
With costumes and art direction

35:50.616 --> 35:52.749
that looked distinctly Egyptian,

35:52.784 --> 35:54.751
the series suggested

35:54.786 --> 35:57.754
that the characters in the story
most likely found a home

35:57.789 --> 36:00.023
on Earth in the distant past.

36:02.127 --> 36:07.097
Another ancient astronaut-based
film that rivaled <i> Star Wars</i>

36:07.132 --> 36:10.567
in both box office success
and cultural impact

36:10.669 --> 36:14.971
was Steven Spielberg's <i> Close</i>
<i>Encounters of the Third Kind.</i>

36:16.308 --> 36:18.642
The film's depiction
of extraterrestrials

36:18.677 --> 36:21.211
as both benign and benevolent
owed much

36:21.346 --> 36:24.881
to von Daniken's theory
that aliens are just as curious

36:25.017 --> 36:29.786
about us as we are about them.

36:29.821 --> 36:34.991
The cultural impact of <i> Chariots</i>
<i>of the Gods?</i> remains immense.

36:35.027 --> 36:38.161
Everything
from <i> Star Trek,</i> to <i> The X-Files,</i>

36:38.197 --> 36:40.163
to the <i> Alien</i> franchise

36:40.199 --> 36:42.666
has kind of incorporated

36:42.701 --> 36:45.068
these ancient astronaut ideas.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.215
HENRY: <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>
has enabled

36:47.239 --> 36:49.940
creative types,
from across the board...

36:50.042 --> 36:53.610
in films, in television shows,
in novels...

36:53.712 --> 36:56.646
to-to really explore
this ultimate question of

36:56.682 --> 36:58.248
where did we come from?

36:58.383 --> 36:59.883
And that is, I think,

36:59.918 --> 37:02.152
what ultimately
drives this phenomenon.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.199
Deep within us,
we're almost programmed

37:04.223 --> 37:06.756
to answer that question
in a creative way.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.941
SHATNER:
To come up with a book

37:11.063 --> 37:15.165
that says aliens visited Earth,
and then to have movies

37:15.200 --> 37:17.601
and television
and radio and-and newspapers

37:17.703 --> 37:21.104
and-and comic books
deliver that message,

37:21.206 --> 37:25.141
uh, has to affect generations,
absolutely.

37:27.112 --> 37:29.713
NARRATOR: But as science fiction
buffs will tell you,

37:29.748 --> 37:32.816
the idea of intelligent aliens
coming to Earth

37:32.918 --> 37:35.685
and shaping its future
thousands of years ago

37:35.721 --> 37:37.954
was not entirely a new one.

37:39.758 --> 37:44.628
In 1961, Russian physicist and
mathematician Matest Agrest

37:44.730 --> 37:47.364
published a controversial paper
proposing

37:47.399 --> 37:50.200
that extraterrestrials
had visited

37:50.235 --> 37:53.069
Earth's ancient civilizations.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.872
Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film

37:55.907 --> 37:59.643
<i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> was based

37:59.745 --> 38:02.178
on Arthur C. Clarke's book
<i>The Sentinel,</i>

38:02.281 --> 38:05.815
written more
than a decade earlier.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.397
So you had a number of films
that began to tap very directly

38:08.453 --> 38:10.320
into ancient astronaut lore.

38:10.455 --> 38:15.158
In 1980, you had the release
of a film called <i> Hangar 18.</i>

38:15.260 --> 38:19.362
It concerns attempted reverse
engineering of alien technology.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.932
Moving into the 1990s,
you had the film <i> Stargate,</i>

38:22.968 --> 38:24.412
which was directed
by Roland Emmerich.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.703
Roland Emmerich has made
no secret of the fact

38:26.805 --> 38:30.006
that he was very directly
inspired by Erich von Daniken.

38:30.108 --> 38:33.209
Other examples would include
the 2011 film <i> Cowboys & Aliens,</i>

38:33.245 --> 38:35.679
which was produced
by Steven Spielberg;

38:35.814 --> 38:37.681
the Marvel production of <i> Thor,</i>

38:37.783 --> 38:39.849
which concerns
ancient Norse gods

38:39.951 --> 38:41.951
being actually
extraterrestrials;

38:41.987 --> 38:44.754
and Ridley Scott's
<i>Prometheus</i> from 2012.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.801
During the promotional campaign
for that,

38:46.825 --> 38:48.725
he was very open
about the fact

38:48.827 --> 38:50.972
that he was directly influenced
by Erich von Daniken.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.897
FOX: I do feel like
it permeates pop culture

38:53.932 --> 38:58.368
to the point now where, if you
took a survey of young adults,

38:58.503 --> 39:01.438
I would assume the majority
of them are probably very open

39:01.473 --> 39:03.707
to the idea
that extraterrestrials

39:03.809 --> 39:08.244
have visited us at some point,
present, or in the distant past.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.750
NARRATOR: But why is it that
the public seems more open now

39:13.852 --> 39:16.386
to Erich von Daniken's ideas

39:16.521 --> 39:19.155
than at the time when the book
was first written?

39:19.191 --> 39:21.891
COLLINS:
The question comes of

39:21.993 --> 39:23.960
are we being influenced

39:23.995 --> 39:28.098
from some kind
of non-terrestrial source?

39:28.200 --> 39:31.368
Is it possible that perhaps

39:31.403 --> 39:36.439
cosmic beings, extraterrestrials
are influencing certain people

39:36.541 --> 39:40.844
to externalize
our alien origins?

39:42.381 --> 39:45.849
POPE: Science fiction
may be entertainment,

39:45.884 --> 39:49.085
but when you look
at Hollywood blockbusters,

39:49.187 --> 39:51.888
so many of them relate to

39:51.923 --> 39:55.458
how we interact with
other species in the universe.

39:55.494 --> 39:56.926
Why is that?

39:57.028 --> 40:01.798
Perhaps this is hard-wired
into us.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.768
We know that this was our past,

40:04.870 --> 40:08.371
and we know
that it will be our future.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.940
There has never been
a time in history

40:11.076 --> 40:13.443
when humanity was more prepared

40:13.578 --> 40:16.012
for the appearance
of these extraterrestrials.

40:16.047 --> 40:19.783
Through our modern science, our
understanding of space travel,

40:19.918 --> 40:22.452
coupled with our entertainment
and our culture

40:22.554 --> 40:25.522
that's been preparing us for the
existence of extraterrestrials,

40:25.557 --> 40:27.791
we are now absolutely more ready

40:27.893 --> 40:30.627
than ever for the appearance
of these beings.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.876
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that there was

40:34.900 --> 40:38.968
an extraterrestrial inspiration
behind <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

40:39.104 --> 40:43.173
And if so, are we being prepared
for a reconnection

40:43.208 --> 40:46.509
with the same beings that,
according to Erich von Daniken,

40:46.545 --> 40:50.180
visited Earth
thousands of years ago?

40:50.282 --> 40:53.850
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

40:53.952 --> 40:56.519
and suggest
further evidence can be found

40:56.555 --> 40:59.889
by examining the vast influence
the book has had,

40:59.925 --> 41:05.261
and continues to have,
all across the world.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.165
During the decades
that followed the publication

41:09.201 --> 41:11.134
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

41:11.169 --> 41:15.305
ancient astronaut theory
was becoming a movement.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.307
Growing millions of people

41:17.342 --> 41:20.076
were now increasingly open
to the idea

41:20.212 --> 41:23.913
that not only are humans
not alone in the universe,

41:24.049 --> 41:26.716
but that intelligent aliens
continue

41:26.818 --> 41:28.785
to monitor their progress.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.920
HOWE:
And so something

41:31.056 --> 41:34.757
began to turn
in the entire American psyche.

41:34.893 --> 41:39.095
People are asking
very intelligent questions.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.144
NARRATOR:
Although still rejected

41:43.168 --> 41:45.768
by mainstream scholars
and archaeologists,

41:45.904 --> 41:47.837
it was attracting a growing army

41:47.873 --> 41:51.774
of researchers,
writers and journalists.

41:51.843 --> 41:56.513
Erich was making these places
very exciting and fascinating.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.315
And for me, it was exciting

41:59.351 --> 42:02.218
that, wow,
all these places were out there.

42:02.254 --> 42:05.154
They can be seen.
They're real.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.924
So I really have
to give him the credit

42:08.026 --> 42:11.194
because it helped me
travel around the world.

42:11.229 --> 42:17.467
Reading Erich's books gave me
a whole new view on the past.

42:17.602 --> 42:19.580
HENRY: And I remember
looking through that book,

42:19.604 --> 42:21.404
and I was instantly hooked.

42:21.439 --> 42:25.141
And really just started diving
deep into this whole idea,

42:25.277 --> 42:29.145
this theory that humans
had long ago interacted with,

42:29.281 --> 42:33.883
and been incredibly altered by,
extraterrestrial beings.

42:33.919 --> 42:36.019
NARRATOR:
Fueling the growing army

42:36.054 --> 42:37.554
of ancient astronaut theorists

42:37.589 --> 42:41.991
were exciting new
archaeological discoveries,

42:42.127 --> 42:45.061
like Gobekli Tepe,
a series of stone monoliths

42:45.096 --> 42:50.333
found buried in the plains near
Sanliurfa, Turkey in 1996.

42:50.468 --> 42:53.202
According to radiocarbon dating,

42:53.305 --> 42:56.906
the structures could be
as much as 12,000 years old,

42:56.942 --> 42:59.309
more than 5,000 years older

42:59.411 --> 43:03.146
than the earliest known
civilization in Mesopotamia.

43:03.248 --> 43:07.183
PAUL BAHN: The site of
Gobekli Tepe in Southeast Turkey

43:07.319 --> 43:09.130
very rapidly became
one of the most important

43:09.154 --> 43:10.965
archeological sites
in the world,

43:10.989 --> 43:14.057
because we'd never before
known or imagined, even,

43:14.159 --> 43:16.359
that simple hunter-gatherers
could produce

43:16.494 --> 43:19.028
such spectacular
monumental structures

43:19.164 --> 43:21.197
as are found at Gobekli Tepe.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.400
These limestone pillars
are up to 18 feet high.

43:24.502 --> 43:27.103
They're beautifully dressed
and smoothed.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.239
We've never seen work like that
from that period before.

43:30.275 --> 43:34.444
And the geomagnetic analyses
that have been done

43:34.479 --> 43:37.180
of what's under the surface
seem to indicate

43:37.282 --> 43:39.616
that there are at least
20 major circular structures

43:39.651 --> 43:41.584
in this mound.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.621
And so far they've
dug up to half of them,

43:44.656 --> 43:47.323
but there's still
an awful lot of work to go.

43:47.359 --> 43:50.193
CHILDRESS:
Erich had theorized

43:50.295 --> 43:52.562
that these
ancient civilizations,

43:52.697 --> 43:56.366
many of them in contact or
developed by extraterrestrials,

43:56.468 --> 43:59.235
were destroyed...

43:59.304 --> 44:03.906
in a cataclysm like
the biblical flood of the Bible.

44:04.042 --> 44:07.910
Gobekli Tepe was built
over 12,000 years ago,

44:08.046 --> 44:11.414
and we have no records
of it being built

44:11.483 --> 44:13.416
or who built it.

44:13.551 --> 44:15.529
So you have to ask yourself:
were the people

44:15.553 --> 44:19.455
who built Gobekli Tepe
destroyed in a great flood

44:19.491 --> 44:22.158
like was depicted in the Bible?

44:23.728 --> 44:27.330
FOX: The theory
that I gravitate to the most

44:27.365 --> 44:29.265
is just that there was a...

44:29.401 --> 44:32.969
a pre-flood
advanced civilization

44:33.004 --> 44:35.505
that was almost entirely
eradicated at some point.

44:35.540 --> 44:39.175
And the idea of that being
connected to the Younger Dryas,

44:39.210 --> 44:41.110
because there do seem to be

44:41.246 --> 44:43.346
a lot of these
megalithic structures

44:43.381 --> 44:46.015
that were erected
around the same time.

44:46.051 --> 44:47.995
Like you have Robert Schoch,
who's dated the Sphinx,

44:48.019 --> 44:49.919
I think, to 12,000 years ago.

44:50.021 --> 44:53.589
And we have Gobekli Tepe, which
turned everything on its head.

♪ ♪

44:55.760 --> 44:58.194
NARRATOR: Another,
even more recent, discovery

44:58.229 --> 45:01.197
that has added fuel to
the ancient astronaut argument

45:01.232 --> 45:04.267
was made in West Java,
Indonesia.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.202
In 2011,

45:06.237 --> 45:09.706
archaeologists began
a formal excavation of a site

45:09.741 --> 45:13.342
known as Gunung Padang,
or "Mountain of Light."

45:15.113 --> 45:18.381
Gunung Padang is a megalithic

45:18.416 --> 45:21.384
pyramid hill in Java.

45:23.121 --> 45:26.989
A Javanese geologist
by the name of Danny Hilman

45:27.058 --> 45:30.426
has led a team to investigate
the deeper levels of the site.

45:30.462 --> 45:33.663
And he's found
indisputable evidence

45:33.798 --> 45:38.501
that it goes back
to at least 8000 BC.

45:38.636 --> 45:40.603
And, indeed, in the center of it

45:40.638 --> 45:43.239
is what appears to be
a lava tube,

45:43.274 --> 45:46.008
and that has given
dating evidence

45:46.144 --> 45:50.012
that suggests that
there was human activity there

45:50.148 --> 45:53.082
as early as 25000 BC.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.687
NARRATOR:
25000 BC?

45:57.822 --> 46:01.290
Could this pyramid-shaped hill
really be hiding a structure

46:01.326 --> 46:03.292
that ancient humans built

46:03.328 --> 46:07.196
20,000 years before
the first known civilization?

46:07.265 --> 46:10.633
Utilizing
ground-penetrating radar

46:10.668 --> 46:12.635
and seismic tomographic scans,

46:12.670 --> 46:16.205
geologists discovered
that concealed beneath the Earth

46:16.341 --> 46:20.276
is a step pyramid
that is over 300 feet tall.

46:21.813 --> 46:25.748
Gunung Padang is, of course,
linked to local mythology.

46:25.784 --> 46:30.553
And in local mythology, it
means the "Mountain of Light."

46:30.688 --> 46:32.588
In Indonesian star lore,

46:32.624 --> 46:35.358
there's a constellation
of particular interest.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.461
They call it Vendum Viduk.

46:38.496 --> 46:40.163
We call it Ursa Major.

46:40.198 --> 46:42.565
It is thought that it is
the shape of a boat,

46:42.700 --> 46:45.101
and that the original craft,

46:45.203 --> 46:49.138
the original starship
carrying the people,

46:49.174 --> 46:52.742
came from this place
to their land.

46:52.877 --> 46:56.345
Their houses, the longhouses,
the community structures,

46:56.381 --> 46:59.415
are built
in the shape of a boat,

46:59.551 --> 47:01.584
always facing northward,

47:01.719 --> 47:05.054
in honor of the place
of their origins.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.491
These star travelers
are said to have started

47:08.526 --> 47:11.260
the original royal family.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.462
The name of the people, Toraja,

47:13.498 --> 47:17.099
means "those who come
from the stars."

47:17.168 --> 47:20.102
NARRATOR:
Adding to the compelling notion

47:20.171 --> 47:22.738
of "star travelers"
are the ever-increasing number

47:22.841 --> 47:25.775
of archaeological discoveries
that feature carvings

47:25.910 --> 47:28.277
of what appear to be spacemen.

47:28.413 --> 47:32.281
Although many earlier examples
had already been chronicled

47:32.417 --> 47:34.784
in von Daniken's early books,

47:34.853 --> 47:36.813
the sheer number
of recent finds...

47:36.921 --> 47:39.355
and the global nature of them...
has helped to undermine

47:39.390 --> 47:41.791
the notion that
these ancient petroglyphs

47:41.926 --> 47:45.561
are entirely based on myth.

47:45.597 --> 47:48.464
CHILDRESS: There is
a vast number of ancient images

47:48.600 --> 47:52.535
that appear to be people
in space suits.

47:52.570 --> 47:56.839
Some of these are in remote
places, like southern Algeria,

47:56.875 --> 48:00.643
where even archeologists
have given names

48:00.778 --> 48:02.745
to these people in space suits,

48:02.780 --> 48:05.882
like "the Martian god"
and things like that.

48:07.785 --> 48:10.887
Many of the petroglyphs
at Nine Mile Canyon in Utah

48:10.922 --> 48:12.822
are very strange.

48:12.957 --> 48:15.791
At the Family Panel,
we see what appears to be

48:15.894 --> 48:18.494
a man and a woman
standing there.

48:18.563 --> 48:23.666
They seem to have space helmets
on their heads with antenna.

48:23.735 --> 48:28.504
The Navajos themselves
claim that these petroglyphs

48:28.573 --> 48:32.441
were from people
who were before the flood,

48:32.477 --> 48:36.279
before this cataclysm
had come to the Earth.

48:36.314 --> 48:38.748
And they maintain
that these images

48:38.783 --> 48:41.584
were many thousands
of years old.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.821
NARRATOR: But rock carvings
and ancient monoliths

48:45.924 --> 48:49.525
are not the only recent
discoveries that have helped

48:49.661 --> 48:52.194
build upon Erich von Daniken's
original theory.

48:52.330 --> 48:56.299
There are some made
of flesh and bone,

48:56.334 --> 48:58.367
and where
the scientific evidence

48:58.503 --> 49:02.438
of ancient astronauts
might be... indisputable.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.756
NARRATOR
Paracas, Peru.

49:08.780 --> 49:11.614
February 2018.

49:11.649 --> 49:14.750
In his ongoing search
for further evidence

49:14.786 --> 49:18.054
that ancient aliens came
to Earth centuries ago,

49:18.156 --> 49:22.391
Erich von Daniken travels
to the Paracas History Museum

49:22.493 --> 49:24.694
to meet with the museum's
assistant director,

49:24.796 --> 49:27.296
Brien Foerster.

49:27.332 --> 49:30.232
Foerster has promised
to give him an up-close look

49:30.335 --> 49:32.279
at a remarkable collection
of skulls...

49:32.303 --> 49:34.270
skulls which
von Daniken believes

49:34.305 --> 49:37.707
-are not of human origin.
-FOERSTER: These were all found

49:37.809 --> 49:41.410
in the same tomb, and so they
were members of the same family.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.379
NARRATOR:
Over the years,

49:43.481 --> 49:46.582
hundreds of strangely
elongated human-like skulls

49:46.684 --> 49:49.085
have been found
all over the world...

49:49.187 --> 49:52.388
from Australia, where
the skulls were estimated to be

49:52.490 --> 49:55.157
at least 10,000 years old,

49:55.193 --> 49:57.827
to the Ukraine, where they
were found in catacombs

49:57.862 --> 50:02.098
that are known to date back
at least 5,000 years.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.102
Because throughout history
various cultures have engaged

50:06.204 --> 50:09.372
in the ritual practice
of artificially elongating

50:09.407 --> 50:12.441
the skulls of infants
by tightly wrapping their heads,

50:12.543 --> 50:15.111
most members
of both the scientific

50:15.213 --> 50:18.347
and academic communities
have dismissed the skulls

50:18.383 --> 50:20.160
found in Peru
as having been created

50:20.184 --> 50:22.351
by using the same method.

50:22.387 --> 50:24.420
But Brien Foerster is

50:24.522 --> 50:26.367
one of a growing handful
that does not agree.

50:26.391 --> 50:29.291
According to his years
of research,

50:29.394 --> 50:33.095
a number of the skulls on
display at the Paracas museum

50:33.197 --> 50:36.332
exhibit other characteristics
that cannot be explained

50:36.367 --> 50:39.368
by the native practice
of head-binding.

50:39.404 --> 50:42.338
What's controversial about
the elongated skulls is that,

50:42.373 --> 50:44.707
in many cases,
the cranial capacity

50:44.742 --> 50:47.543
is larger than a normal human.

50:47.578 --> 50:50.546
And therefore, they
would not simply be examples

50:50.581 --> 50:52.681
of cranial deformation,

50:52.717 --> 50:57.153
but possibly a separate
subspecies of humanity,

50:57.255 --> 50:58.621
or more.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.389
Now...

51:00.425 --> 51:02.324
-Oh, wow, wow, wow.
-Yeah.

51:02.427 --> 51:04.827
At least 20, if not more,
I would suggest here.

51:04.929 --> 51:08.164
Mm-hmm. This is
the main display case.

51:08.266 --> 51:10.210
This is a normal-looking
human skull

51:10.234 --> 51:11.834
from the Inca time period.

51:11.936 --> 51:13.335
This was a farmer.

51:13.438 --> 51:15.538
But then you see
the variation in shapes.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.240
You have ones which are
horizontally elongated,

51:18.276 --> 51:19.742
like that one.

51:19.777 --> 51:22.745
And then you have
the classic vertical elongation.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.614
And notice the size
of the eye sockets.

51:25.650 --> 51:28.784
the eye sockets are,
in some cases, 50% larger

51:28.820 --> 51:30.653
than a normal human being.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.923
VON DANIKEN:
Wow. Absolutely incredible.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.492
You have two possibilities.
Are we humans

51:36.594 --> 51:38.527
made the change?

51:38.629 --> 51:40.574
Artificially,
we pressed the head together,

51:40.598 --> 51:42.242
-the bones together.
-Mm-hmm.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.767
Or we have to do, again,
with extraterrestrials.

51:44.802 --> 51:48.370
FOERSTER: Very unlikely that
it's simple cranial deformation.

51:48.473 --> 51:50.339
I think, genetically,

51:50.441 --> 51:53.209
this person may have been born
with an elongated skull.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.255
What can you explain me
to this here?

51:55.279 --> 51:59.281
Well, I want you
to go ahead and hold this.

51:59.317 --> 52:00.916
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

52:00.952 --> 52:03.219
That's a classic
Paracas elongated skull.

52:03.321 --> 52:05.561
Yes, except for there is
no fontanel. I see nada.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.890
Exactly. The sagittal
suture is missing.

52:07.992 --> 52:10.392
Something is wrong here.

52:10.495 --> 52:13.629
NARRATOR:
Missing the sagittal suture?

52:15.333 --> 52:18.601
The fibrous tissue joint
found on every human skull

52:18.636 --> 52:22.404
connecting the two large bones
that protect the brain?

52:22.507 --> 52:24.673
But how could it be missing?

52:26.010 --> 52:28.310
FOERSTER:
And so medical professionals

52:28.346 --> 52:30.980
are absolutely dumbfounded
when they see it.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.450
It doesn't...

52:34.485 --> 52:37.586
fit in with...
a normal human skull.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.488
Incredible.

52:39.524 --> 52:42.291
NARRATOR: Eight years
after Erich von Daniken

52:42.326 --> 52:44.493
wrote <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

52:44.529 --> 52:46.829
author and researcher
Zecharia Sitchin

52:46.864 --> 52:50.366
began publishing his
<i>Earth Chronicles</i> book series,

52:50.401 --> 52:52.668
which also proposed
that ancient aliens

52:52.703 --> 52:56.805
had a hand in the creation
and development of humankind.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.675
In <i> There Were Giants</i>
<i>Upon the Earth,</i>

52:59.710 --> 53:02.745
Sitchin suggested
that extraterrestrial DNA

53:02.847 --> 53:05.014
still exists in humans,

53:05.049 --> 53:07.950
and that the proof
might be found

53:08.052 --> 53:10.030
by closely examining
the ancient skull

53:10.054 --> 53:14.623
of a Sumerian queen who ruled
sometime around 2500 BC

53:14.725 --> 53:16.759
and which is
currently being stored

53:16.861 --> 53:20.462
at the Natural History Museum
in London.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.543
One of the greatest researchers
of our time

53:22.567 --> 53:24.900
in the ancient astronaut theory,
Zecharia Sitchin,

53:24.936 --> 53:28.304
who passed away in 2010,
had one last wish,

53:28.406 --> 53:30.573
closing out
his legacy of research,

53:30.608 --> 53:33.876
which was to test
the remains of Queen Puabi.

53:36.581 --> 53:39.014
Sitchin spent 50 years
of research

53:39.050 --> 53:43.986
looking into Sumerian cuneiform,
and putting forth the idea

53:44.088 --> 53:47.489
that the Anunnaki,
these extraterrestrial gods,

53:47.592 --> 53:49.825
visited ancient Sumer.

53:49.927 --> 53:51.994
And what's
really interesting is that

53:52.096 --> 53:54.363
she was actually known
as Nin-Puabi,

53:54.398 --> 53:57.399
with the "Nin" actually
representing the term "goddess"

53:57.435 --> 53:59.335
in the Sumerian language.

53:59.437 --> 54:02.004
So Zecharia Sitchin felt
very strongly

54:02.106 --> 54:03.917
that if
the Natural History Museum

54:03.941 --> 54:06.308
were to do genetic testing
on Queen Puabi,

54:06.410 --> 54:08.744
that we would find that there
are parts of her DNA

54:08.779 --> 54:11.547
that are extraterrestrial.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.450
It's said that she had
an elongated head,

54:14.485 --> 54:18.921
as many of the kings and queens
and royalty of Sumeria had,

54:18.956 --> 54:21.390
as did the Anunnaki.

54:21.425 --> 54:25.060
And some say that she had
more teeth in her mouth

54:25.096 --> 54:27.963
than a normal human.

54:27.999 --> 54:32.568
If they won't test these
remains, you have to ask why.

54:32.603 --> 54:37.406
Is there some secret
encoded in that DNA

54:37.441 --> 54:39.808
that they don't want to hear?

54:39.844 --> 54:43.879
Might it be that the remains
of Queen Puabi could prove

54:43.981 --> 54:46.982
for once and for all that
ancient astronaut theory

54:47.018 --> 54:49.718
isn't theory after all?

54:49.820 --> 54:52.054
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that proof

54:52.156 --> 54:55.724
of humanity's extraterrestrial
origins actually exists?

54:55.826 --> 55:00.062
And if so, could it currently
be sitting... unexamined...

55:00.164 --> 55:02.898
on a shelf in a London museum?

55:03.000 --> 55:06.368
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

55:06.470 --> 55:08.804
but believe equally
compelling evidence

55:08.839 --> 55:11.940
can also be found,
and on a much larger scale,

55:11.976 --> 55:14.810
hiding in plain sight.

55:23.287 --> 55:26.755
NARRATOR:
July 20, 1969.

55:26.791 --> 55:30.559
Apollo 11 astronauts
Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

55:30.695 --> 55:33.562
plant an American flag
on the Moon.

55:33.698 --> 55:36.965
It is the commemoration
of an historic moment,

55:37.001 --> 55:40.469
as two humans become the first
alien visitors from Earth

55:40.504 --> 55:43.339
to land on another
celestial body.

55:43.374 --> 55:46.742
In his book
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

55:46.877 --> 55:48.410
Erich von Daniken suggested

55:48.479 --> 55:51.347
that not only did
extraterrestrial visitors

55:51.382 --> 55:54.516
from other planets come to Earth
in the distant past,

55:54.552 --> 55:57.686
but that they,
like the American astronauts,

55:57.722 --> 55:59.855
also commemorated their visits

55:59.890 --> 56:03.525
in the form of mysterious
carvings and structures.

56:03.561 --> 56:07.429
VON DANIKEN: These visitors
did not plant a flag.

56:07.565 --> 56:11.700
They have left proof,
definitive proof.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.336
COLLINS:
All the way around the world

56:14.372 --> 56:16.438
we find ancient monuments

56:16.574 --> 56:20.976
that have some kind of
relationship to the stars.

56:21.011 --> 56:24.246
Whether they reflect
the astronomical positions

56:24.348 --> 56:26.281
of a particular star group

56:26.417 --> 56:28.951
or they are aligned
with precision

56:29.019 --> 56:32.354
towards the rising
or setting of a star.

56:32.390 --> 56:33.856
Now what does this mean?

56:33.891 --> 56:36.291
Is it possible
that they are places

56:36.427 --> 56:38.961
of origins of cosmic beings?

56:39.096 --> 56:41.864
It's their flag.
"Yes, we were here."

56:43.934 --> 56:45.746
NARRATOR: In the decades since
the publication

56:45.770 --> 56:49.304
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>
ancient astronaut theorists

56:49.440 --> 56:50.680
have looked for other examples

56:50.708 --> 56:53.475
of alien architecture
here on Earth.

56:53.611 --> 56:56.678
One location
of particular interest

56:56.714 --> 56:59.314
is the Giza Plateau in Egypt.

56:59.450 --> 57:01.650
In the late 1980s,

57:01.719 --> 57:04.987
author and ancient Egyptian
researcher Robert Bauval

57:05.122 --> 57:07.890
introduced his
Orion correlation theory.

57:07.925 --> 57:11.593
It suggested that the pyramids
of Giza were built

57:11.629 --> 57:15.397
to align with
the belt stars of Orion.

57:15.433 --> 57:17.577
ROBERT BAUVAL: Orion's Belt is
made up of three bright stars.

57:17.601 --> 57:21.570
There's two bright stars
and a third dimmer star,

57:21.605 --> 57:23.739
which is offset a bit
to the left.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.575
It's exactly what you see
on the ground,

57:26.610 --> 57:28.844
two large pyramids in alignment

57:28.979 --> 57:31.547
with a third pyramid offset.

57:33.818 --> 57:36.318
NARRATOR: Similar pyramid
alignments to the belt stars

57:36.420 --> 57:39.655
of Orion were also discovered
halfway around the world

57:39.757 --> 57:43.692
at the ancient Aztec pyramid
complex of Teotihuacan,

57:43.828 --> 57:47.362
just outside of Mexico City.

57:47.498 --> 57:51.767
The central road of Teotihuacan,
the Avenue of the Dead,

57:51.802 --> 57:54.369
connects three massive
pyramids.

57:54.505 --> 57:56.638
Not only are
these structures aligned

57:56.674 --> 57:58.874
with the three stars
of Orion's belt,

57:59.009 --> 58:00.620
but the Avenue
of the Dead, itself,

58:00.644 --> 58:04.947
points towards
the Pleiades star cluster.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.484
There was a tremendous amount
of discussion about this,

58:08.519 --> 58:11.420
starting in the late '80s
to the '90s.

58:11.455 --> 58:15.891
And what it did was make us all
start thinking

58:16.026 --> 58:21.563
about the surface of the Earth
in relationship to the stars

58:21.699 --> 58:25.601
and other intelligences
that would come here.

58:25.636 --> 58:28.770
NARRATOR: A similar celestial
alignment is seen

58:28.806 --> 58:31.540
on the Mediterranean island
of Sardinia,

58:31.642 --> 58:34.409
where an ancient culture
known as the Nuraghe

58:34.545 --> 58:37.980
built megalithic towers.

58:38.015 --> 58:41.450
Santu Antine is one of the
largest Neolithic sites

58:41.485 --> 58:43.819
on Sardinia.

58:43.854 --> 58:46.755
What's very interesting about it
is that, when we look at it,

58:46.891 --> 58:49.625
along with the seven other
structures, it is patterned

58:49.660 --> 58:52.127
after the star cluster
the Pleiades.

58:52.162 --> 58:53.996
What does this tell us?

58:54.031 --> 58:55.976
Well, it tells us that
it's possible that

58:56.000 --> 58:58.534
the inhabitants of Sardinia
were actually in contact

58:58.569 --> 59:01.036
with beings from the Pleiades,

59:01.071 --> 59:03.772
and that they created this
incredible Neolithic structure

59:03.908 --> 59:06.608
to commemorate, perhaps,
a visitation,

59:06.744 --> 59:11.513
or perhaps a desire to travel
to the Pleiades.

59:11.549 --> 59:14.616
The fact that so many
of these structures

59:14.752 --> 59:16.785
do align to the Pleiades

59:16.921 --> 59:21.123
is perhaps a clue that the
Pleiades are hugely important.

59:22.726 --> 59:24.960
Hermes Trismegistus,
who is the Greek name

59:25.095 --> 59:26.695
for the Egyptian god Thoth,

59:26.730 --> 59:30.165
said that "Egypt is the mirror
of the heavens."

59:30.200 --> 59:32.134
And, based on that,

59:32.269 --> 59:34.047
ancient Egyptians had
this belief

59:34.071 --> 59:37.573
that the earthly Nile was
a mirror of the heavenly Nile,

59:37.608 --> 59:39.041
the Milky Way.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.643
The ancient Egyptians placed
their pyramids

59:41.779 --> 59:43.545
in specific places

59:43.581 --> 59:46.615
so that they could ultimately
unite ancient Egypt

59:46.717 --> 59:49.217
with the stars.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.653
All of these alignments
are so precise

59:51.789 --> 59:54.823
and align with the Milky Way
as it would have been seen

59:54.959 --> 59:59.628
in the night sky
around 11000 BC.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.890
What you can do with
astronomical programs is

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:03.532
to sort of rewind the clock.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.234
You can look back and say, okay,
when was there a time

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.837
when there was a star
in this exact position

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.584
and all the other
pyramids also align

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:12.774
with different stellar
configurations?

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.711
And what that would mean is that
ancient Egyptian civilization

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:19.881
went back far farther into
the past than we believe today.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:23.719
POPE: These structures are like
"X marks the spot."

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:27.756
What they say, perhaps,
is "We were here."

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.026
That's what civilizations do.
That's what people do.

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.528
When they visit something,
they leave something.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:36.932
NARRATOR: In recent years,
a growing number

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.701
of ancient astronaut theorists
have suggested that

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:43.639
not only did extraterrestrials
influence our ancestors

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:46.541
as to the precise positioning
of important structures,

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:49.711
but they did so in a way
that was designed

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.215
to tap into the Earth's
natural energy.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:56.284
There are various places
around our planet

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.054
that are said to be
power places;

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:02.658
places of vortex energy.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:07.562
And they are all connected
to this worldwide energy grid

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:09.898
that surrounds our planet

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:14.803
and that these places are areas
where energy lines cross.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.273
It might be that
extraterrestrials are also

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:21.576
tapping into this worldwide
energy grid.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:26.081
NARRATOR: Curiously, at many
mysterious sites worldwide,

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:29.851
researchers have noted yet
another peculiar connection.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.921
Many early depictions
of the so-called "gods"

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.271
have been immortalized carrying
what appears to be

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:38.326
a type of handbag.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.029
CHILDRESS:
These mysterious handbags

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:43.665
are held by the Sumerian gods.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:49.638
We find it in Mexico
with the Olmecs.

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:52.941
We find it in Mongolia, as well.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.111
We find it in Colombia.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:02:00.649
It may be some type of
misunderstood technology.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:04.886
Perhaps it was some type
of a tool bag,

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:08.290
or some type of, maybe,
a breathing apparatus

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.226
for extraterrestrials,

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:14.362
because it doesn't look like
a fashion item.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:17.165
It looks more like
a transmitter,

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:21.970
an old cell phone, a computer.

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:24.740
If you look at our astronauts
as they're walking

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:28.343
from the launch tower
into the spacecraft,

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.612
they carry a suitcase system.

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.381
That's their temporary
life-support system.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:37.219
It's very possible that
this is something similar.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.689
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists have also noted

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:43.391
that there appears to be
a common narrative thread

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:47.062
amongst the cultures where
the depictions are present.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.831
As we begin to trace
this handbag symbol,

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:52.234
we see that it appears
at Gobekli Tepe,

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.904
where there is this sudden spike
in civilization.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:59.341
It reappears in Sumeria,
where we suddenly have

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:02.310
this infusion of knowledge.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:06.014
Same thing virtually every place
this handbag appears,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:10.085
we find this sudden spike,
or infusion, of new knowledge.

01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:15.323
There are tales in ancient
Mesopotamia of a figure

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:18.360
thought of as
the bringer of civilization,

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:22.297
sometimes called Adapa,
or Dagan, or Oannes,

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:27.035
sometimes described as
fish-tailed or bird-headed,

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:30.705
and this character is
carrying a bag.

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:34.776
And in that bag, all of the
learning, all of the sciences,

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:38.547
all of the imagination
that humanity will ever need.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:45.220
There's a theory that
they had the ability

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:48.723
to levitate through energy that
might have been given to us

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.258
by a-an alien.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:53.228
I mean, it's
a science fiction concept,

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:54.930
but we don't know for sure.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:58.400
Although we know that the Aztecs
and the Egyptians

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.869
and the people that
came before them did have

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:04.072
some technology, we don't even
know how much technology

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.974
they might have had.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:10.078
That's why von Daniken's theory
is possible.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.414
NARRATOR:
Is Erich von Daniken,

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:14.494
and those that have
followed him,

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.752
simply inspired by
individual curiosity,

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.456
or is there some other,
even more profound, reason

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:25.327
why ancient astronaut theory
has become more popular

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.762
and more widely accepted
than ever?

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:30.332
Perhaps the answer can be found

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.467
by returning to one
of the places

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.469
von Daniken first visited

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.572
more than 50 years ago.

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:41.154
NARRATOR:
Peru.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:44.112
February 2018.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:47.148
50 years after the publication
of his first book,

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:50.785
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>
Erich von Daniken

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.968
returns to one of the sites
that helped

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:57.893
inspire him,
the mysterious Nazca plateau.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:04.633
Joining him is ancient astronaut
researcher Brien Foerster.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:07.636
So this is the first time
you're flying from Ica?

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:09.204
I was here,

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:13.742
but I was flying over Nazca,
I think, at least 50 times.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.256
FOERSTER:
There's always more

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.346
to see every time you fly over.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.649
It's very, very impressive.

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:22.095
FOERSTER:
It was Erich von Daniken,

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:23.897
with his book
<i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.988
who exposed the Nazca lines
and figures to the world.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.791
And to actually fly
over Nazca with him

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:31.927
is something
I will never forget.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:34.262
NARRATOR:
Erich and Brien's flight path

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:37.699
takes them over the lesser-known
area called Palpa,

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:42.070
which is situated between
the cities of Paracas and Nazca.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:46.775
There they will investigate
evidence of a new discovery.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.388
FOERSTER:
There are at least a thousand

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:50.712
geoglyphs in this area.

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:54.449
And very few people fly
over Palpa, which is a-a shame,

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:59.054
because we can see
figure after figure now here.

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:02.390
Yeah, Palpa has a lot
of very bizarre designs.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.960
Almost, uh, anthropomorphic.

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:07.929
Crosses between a human
and an insect.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:11.099
We're basically in the middle
of nowhere, more or less.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.901
This is complete desert.

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:15.236
So why so many lines
and geoglyphs

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.706
in such an obscure location?

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:21.209
VON DANIKEN: Look.
One of the long lines crossing

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:23.712
-over the hills over there.
-Oh, yeah.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.481
-Which is another mystery here.
-It is.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:30.018
NARRATOR: According
to mainstream archaeologists,

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.786
the ancient Nazca culture

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:33.488
created these mysterious lines

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.391
between the first
and eighth century AD,

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:40.261
although no one knows exactly
why they were created.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.931
It is also believed
that the images,

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:47.102
which cover an area
of over 170 square miles,

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:50.105
were produced by manually
scraping away the top layer

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.140
of reddish iron-rich soil

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.943
in order to create designs out
of the lighter,

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:57.345
yellowish ground underneath.

01:06:57.381 --> 01:07:00.181
VON DANIKEN: By the way,
I hear from a local...

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:04.052
the pilot here,
the longest of the small lines

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.756
goes over 23 kilometers
straight ahead,

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:11.159
over hills, mountains,
and then crossing the desert.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.294
FOERSTER:
I'm seeing a lot more today

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:14.996
than I've ever seen before.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:18.767
Here are at least 20 lines
under me.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:20.769
Really fantastic.

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:24.372
NARRATOR: As their flight enters
into the Nazca city limits,

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:26.386
they are greeted
by what Erich regards

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.144
as a friendly
and familiar figure.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.312
There he is. Yeah.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:34.315
VON DANIKEN: They call
this figure <i> El Astronauta,</i>

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.029
-the Astronaut.
-Right.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.397
VON DANIKEN:
It looks like an astronaut,

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:39.921
-like a helmet on, et cetera.
-Yeah.

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:41.890
It must come to the world

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:46.227
that this is a mystery made
for flying machines,

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.329
made for so-called gods who fly.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.532
The natives want
to give them sign.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.333
"Hey, look at us. Come down.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.968
"Make a stop over here.

01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:56.471
"We are here.
We are waiting for you.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.551
We have offerings for you.
We have food for you."

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.242
I am absolutely convinced.
I have no doubt.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:02.811
I know too much about it.

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:05.346
There were extraterrestrials
on this planet

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.015
some thousands of years ago.

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:10.485
NARRATOR: In the 50 years
since the publication

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.353
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

01:08:12.456 --> 01:08:14.522
many other large-scale
earth markings

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.492
have been found to exist
throughout the planet,

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:22.197
including recent discoveries
across Saudi Arabia,

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:25.466
Syria, Jordan

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.336
and the Ural Mountains
in Russia.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.371
In 2011,

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.374
archaeologist Sarah Parcak
announced

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.944
that she had located
17 potentially unknown pyramids,

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.080
more than 1,000 tombs

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.916
and some 3,000
ancient human settlements

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:44.385
buried under the sands of Egypt.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:47.555
She was able to accomplish
this unprecedented feat

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:50.125
by utilizing
a revolutionary new tool

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.594
known as space archaeology.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:55.029
TSOUKALOS:
She found 3,000 structures

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:57.298
just by looking
at satellite imagery.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:59.600
That is extraordinary,
something that,

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.469
ten or 20 years ago,

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:03.470
was absolute science fiction.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:09.176
NARRATOR: The use
of infrared satellite technology

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.179
is also revolutionizing
the world

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:15.450
of ancient astronaut
exploration.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.618
Cairo has
the Great Pyramids of Giza.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:21.990
Luxor has all these ancient
Egyptian temples and tombs.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.957
But what you don't know

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.060
is that more than 90% percent

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.598
is still hidden
under the sands of Egypt.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:34.935
Archaeology has probably only
uncovered around ten percent,

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.337
maybe even less,

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.506
of the ruins

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:42.109
and evidence
of past civilizations.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:44.479
And it may well be the case

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.549
that in some of these ruins
may be the evidence

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.185
that we require to show

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.422
that extraterrestrials visited
the Earth back at that time.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.593
NARRATOR:
In 2015,

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:02.330
NASA scientists working on
the International Space Station

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.634
released photos of a group
of more than 200 giant circles,

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:10.071
lines and rings formed
by dirt mounds

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:12.941
in the Turgai area
of Northern Kazakhstan

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:17.111
that are believed
to date back to 6000 BC.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:20.381
TSOUKALOS: When you're
on the ground in Kazakhstan,

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:24.319
all you see is a couple of dots.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:28.089
But up in the sky...
and the higher you go...

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:31.993
you can see
the full extent of everything.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:35.163
But the fact that
they can only be appreciated

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:37.999
from a high distance,
up in the air,

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:41.469
illustrates to me
that perhaps our ancestors

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:46.007
tried to communicate
with someone up there.

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:49.510
With the advent
of new technology,

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.146
especially in correlation
with space archaeology

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:55.516
or satellite technology
that now allows us

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:57.552
to look underneath the sand,

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.554
I can't even imagine

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.590
what else there will be
that we will discover.

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:04.604
FOX: Science is always evolving
and changing,

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:07.195
just like any other practice,
just like archaeology.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:09.631
Once upon a time, if you got
in your little rowboat

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.477
and rowed far enough,
you were gonna go off the edge

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.034
of the Earth.

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:15.370
That wasn't real.
That wasn't true.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:18.039
Let's cut to 200 years
in the future and see

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:19.785
what we understand
at that point.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:22.543
I just don't think you can
ever say the science is settled.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:26.414
SHATNER: I'm of the opinion
that all scientific theory

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.417
is in the midst of big changes.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:33.254
We're walking around
with certain theses in mind.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.557
And, yes, if you drop an apple,
it falls to the ground.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.726
We don't understand gravity.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:41.062
Dark matter and dark energy.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:44.232
The mystery of the theory
of black holes.

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:45.733
We don't understand it.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.446
People who look
through telescopes,

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.204
people who look
through microscopes...

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.774
we're all making it up
as we go along.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.643
Nobody knows for sure.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.480
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:02.283
breakthroughs in archaeology
and genetic research

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:06.354
have made the questions first
raised in <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:09.757
seem less audacious
and closer to being answered.

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:12.226
And joining Erich von Daniken

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:15.396
is a growing army
of like-minded individuals

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:18.366
not only comprised
of ancient astronaut theorists

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:22.136
but scientists,
world leaders, scholars

01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:24.605
and billionaire entrepreneurs.

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:27.775
More and more, the door
that Erich von Daniken opened

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:31.279
50 years ago
has opened much wider

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:34.716
than the Swiss author
ever could have imagined.

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:41.356
NARRATOR:
Pasadena, California.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:44.992
June 17, 2018.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:48.529
Thousands gather at
the Pasadena Convention Center

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:53.034
for AlienCon, a three-day
convention to explore

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.081
the mysteries
of ancient civilization,

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.205
extraterrestrial existence,

01:12:57.307 --> 01:13:00.108
and the unexplained phenomena
of our universe.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.344
I am about to

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.614
introduce you to a man

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.250
that, in 1968,

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:13.054
published a book by the name
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.057
The legend, Erich von Daniken.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.291
(cheering)

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:21.607
NARRATOR: Erich von Daniken
takes the stage

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.133
before an audience
of 3,500 people,

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.635
men and women who are convinced

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:30.638
that mankind's past
and its future

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:33.641
is more extraordinary
and more hopeful

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:37.445
than they had been led to
believe by mainstream science.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.480
MAN:
I would like to say that,

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:42.650
over the course of history
on Planet Earth,

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:44.585
we've seen great men.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:47.121
Moses being one of those,

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:50.158
Abraham Lincoln being another.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:53.261
I'd like to honor you
in that same group of men.

01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:55.663
-Oh. -(Chuckles)
-(cheering and applause)

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:58.366
VON DANIKEN: Thank you very
much. That's very kind of you.

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:01.068
It all started because
of religious doubts.

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:05.106
That was the-the power in me,
to find out what is God.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:08.543
By the way, I still am
a deep believer in God.

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:11.579
So, simply, I had doubts
in my own religion.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.714
In the meantime,
I'm 83 years old.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.517
-The gods love me. (Chuckles)
-(chuckles)

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:19.821
(laughter)

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.490
Since 1968...

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:24.525
it's been 50 years...

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:26.494
how has the reception

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.796
of the ancient astronaut theory,

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:32.600
in your opinion,
changed over 50 years?

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:35.470
It was an immediate best seller
in Germany and in Switzerland.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.183
Then it was sold
to the United States.

01:14:37.207 --> 01:14:38.406
It was a best seller here.

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.219
And soon as it was
a best seller,

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:41.642
I was, of course, attacked.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:43.678
I was crushed down

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:45.825
practically
by every scientific community,

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:48.616
by every scientist,
by newspapers. They all thought,

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:52.119
"This is nonsense, what this
young Swiss fellow is writing.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:53.488
This is garbage."

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.490
So I was attacked.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:56.902
And I'm not the one
who gives up.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.227
So I started to fight
and fight and fight.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:02.363
So, in total,
I have written 41 titles.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:06.434
Roughly 76 million copies
in 32 languages.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:07.802
Not bad. Yeah.

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:13.341
TSOUKALOS:
In the 50 years since <i> Chariots,</i>

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:16.844
what do you think are some
of the best pieces of evidence

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:18.591
that have come forward
that have...

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:21.749
that you did not cover
in <i> Chariots?</i>

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.562
Well, of course,
all these years,

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:26.220
always new material has come.

01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:28.556
And we know so much more
about the Great Pyramid.

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:30.224
We detected rooms,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.227
shafts, corridors, things inside

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:36.430
which I never knew in 1966 when
I made <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:38.410
Now the sequel
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:40.801
is already on the market,
and there is, of course,

01:15:40.837 --> 01:15:42.815
material in there
which you have never seen

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:45.573
and you would not believe
on this planet.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:48.576
(cheering) NARRATOR:
For Erich von Daniken,

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.778
the reception he received
at AlienCon

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:52.513
was both overwhelming

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:54.615
and gratifying.

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:57.385
But equally gratifying
is the fact

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:02.223
that since <i> Chariots of the Gods?</i>
was first published in 1968,

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.470
a growing number
of ancient astronaut theorists

01:16:04.494 --> 01:16:08.729
and researchers have joined him
in his life's mission,

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:11.732
that of opening the mind
of the world

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.636
to the very real likelihood
that aliens exist

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:20.207
and have been visiting the Earth
for thousands of years.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:25.713
Erich,
did you ever imagine this?

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.616
-No, I did not.
-(laughter)

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:32.253
We've seen a fundamental change

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:35.590
in the way that this subject has
been handled.

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:38.759
And we're right on...
I think we're right on the cusp

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.395
of something important here.

01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:45.700
Most people do not realize,
from a biblical point of view,

01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:49.470
how valid many
of his opinions really are.

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:50.983
And I believe
it's very important.

01:16:51.007 --> 01:16:52.607
It's validating for me

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.520
that I've been given
this opportunity,

01:16:54.544 --> 01:16:57.912
that I can share these things
from the authentic sources.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.848
TAYLOR: A friend of mine
that works for NASA

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:04.318
asked me several times,
"How can you go and do

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:05.853
these UFO things that you do?"

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:07.755
And so on, and I-I tell him

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.391
as a scientist,
if you close yourself off

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:14.362
to only looking under
the streetlamp for your keys,

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:17.331
you're never gonna find
your damn keys.

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:19.400
(laughter)

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:25.499
We should learn
to become humble.

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:28.709
We are wonderful humans,
intelligent beings,

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:32.013
but there are fantastic
other beings out there.

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.315
This will be the new science.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.549
The new world.

01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:38.886
-(cheering)
-Thank you.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:52.333
NARRATOR
Antalya, Turkey. 2017.

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:54.735
Officials at Akdeniz University

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.437
announce they have added

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:59.740
a new curriculum
to their program.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:03.344
Entitled
"Ufology and Exopolitics,"

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:05.413
it is designed
to focus on the search

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:07.248
for extraterrestrial life

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:10.284
and galactic diplomacy.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:15.256
At the University of Edinburgh's
U.K. Centre for Astrobiology,

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.425
a course designed
to teach students

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.293
how to search for aliens

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.929
will include
an introduction to astrobiology

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:25.466
and the search
for extraterrestrial life.

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.968
And at Eastern Washington
University

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:30.037
in Cheney, Washington,
is a course

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:33.974
that examines ancient astronaut
theory to see if it can help

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:39.580
explain the missing chapters
in mankind's history.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:44.919
There are college courses today
being taught in exopolitics.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:48.355
It's supposed to be
the new frontier of diplomacy.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:52.526
There's a whole generation
of young people now growing up

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:55.930
not with the question
"Is there life out there?"

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:57.898
but with the kind of issue

01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:00.768
of "What do we do
when it gets here?"

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.937
HENRY:
It's tremendously exciting

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:05.372
that universities around
the world, we're starting to see

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:07.975
courses taught
on ancient astronaut theory.

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:10.010
There's a demand for it.

01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:13.314
The students want to know more,
they want to discuss it,

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:14.648
they want to debate it,

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:17.351
they want to be part
of the revolution.

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:20.354
Just in the past ten years,
we've seen this generation,

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:23.424
new generation of ancient
astronaut theorists come along.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:27.528
They're bringing fresh insight,
they're bringing new facts

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:29.108
that were previously
unavailable.

01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:31.832
And what that's gonna do
is just ultimately open up

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:35.069
the imagination of humanity,
and ultimately help us

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.606
to recover answers to those
vital questions: "Who are we?"

01:19:38.641 --> 01:19:40.107
"Where did we come from?"

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:41.976
And "Where do we go from here?"

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.945
NARRATOR:
Today, more than 50 years

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:47.715
after the publication
of <i> Chariots of the Gods?,</i>

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:50.751
the questions posed
by Erich von Daniken

01:19:50.787 --> 01:19:53.521
are being asked
by a growing number of people...

01:19:53.656 --> 01:19:57.091
people who are more eager
and more ready

01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:01.061
to receive the answers
than ever before.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:06.867
At no time has there ever been
such a big wave of people

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:10.070
believing in alien life,

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:14.108
that extraterrestrials could've
come here in the past,

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.744
that we're not alone,
that we're being visited

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:19.046
and have been visited
in the past.

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:22.082
And so it's a time of change
right now.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:25.152
And in many ways,
the ancient astronaut theory

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:27.588
is leading this change.

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:31.725
HENRY: In the past 50 years,
we've undergone

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.829
a global cultural
paradigm shift.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:38.132
50 years ago, if you were
talking about extraterrestrials,

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.101
other dimensions,
travel by stargates,

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.482
people would have thought
you were crazy or something.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:46.941
But now, this idea
is everywhere in our culture.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.843
It's in our media.

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:51.145
Huge numbers of people
around the world,

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.192
both spiritual
and nonspiritual people,

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:54.582
are beginning to accept the idea

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.750
that we are definitely
not alone.

01:20:56.853 --> 01:21:00.087
TSOUKALOS: Erich von Daniken,
for the past 50 years,

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:03.824
has suggested that if we don't
familiarize ourselves

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:07.461
with the possibility
of extraterrestrial life,

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.965
if and when they show up,
mankind will have

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.635
what he refers to
as a shock of the gods.

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:19.139
So I think it's very beneficial
for people

01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:24.044
to start embracing the idea
of extraterrestrials.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.981
YOUNG:
This is a huge movement.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:30.184
<i>Chariots of the Gods?</i>
is a mythology for our time.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:33.954
There are certain themes
of visitation

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.623
from a celestial location

01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:38.726
that happen throughout
world mythology and religion,

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.195
and it is there,
it's there in a slightly new way

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:44.164
that speaks to our age,
and the response

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:47.101
is nothing short of religious.

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:50.671
The people are longing
for something extraordinary,

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:53.540
and Erich von Daniken
has given it to them.

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:57.745
I do think that the human
collective consciousness

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.580
is shifting.

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:05.586
And people are more open to
accepting some of these ideas.

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:08.889
We've had people that have
worked at NASA go on the record

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.925
as saying that of course
they believe

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.260
extraterrestrial life exists.
"How could it not?"

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:15.763
We've even had people at NASA
say "How could there not be"

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.776
some sort of an architect
to all of this?"

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.000
"How could this be random?"

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.669
If we were to really have
proof of aliens,

01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:23.282
it changes everything
that we've ever been taught,

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:25.117
and there's something scary
about that,

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:27.942
but there's also something
infinitely exciting about that.

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:29.910
SHATNER:
The billions of galaxies

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:31.912
that exist in the universe,

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:35.716
mathematically,
there has to be life everywhere.

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:39.687
Fervent, passionate life
everywhere.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:44.258
In my mind, there's no question
that aliens exist.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.293
(cheering)

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:49.563
NARRATOR: For Erich von Daniken
and the millions of people

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:53.567
he has inspired, the notion of
whether or not extraterrestrials

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:55.936
came to Earth
in the distant past

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:58.839
is a question
they can easily answer.

01:22:58.874 --> 01:23:01.742
For them,
the proof is everywhere:

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:06.981
in ancient architecture,
on the walls of caves,

01:23:07.016 --> 01:23:11.852
on stone blocks
and even in human DNA.

01:23:11.887 --> 01:23:15.022
But the questions
that are harder to answer

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.092
have to do
with mankind's future.

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:21.762
What next?
Where do we go from here?

01:23:21.864 --> 01:23:26.934
And are we on the verge of
uncovering the ultimate proof,

01:23:27.036 --> 01:23:31.839
by finally coming face-to-face
with our alien ancestors?

01:23:31.874 --> 01:23:34.174
The theory of ancient astronauts

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:37.277
will not use 50 years
to be proven.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.280
Within the next ten years,
we will have contact

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:43.050
with extraterrestrials,
and we will ask them

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:46.620
"Were you or your forefathers
here on our planet?"

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:48.682
and they will tell us,
"Of course."

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:53.127
We definitely have our destiny
to return to the stars.
