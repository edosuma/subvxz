00:08.600 --> 00:10.300
HE'S DOING CAREER DAY.
ALL RIGHT.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.600
IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.934
TODAY WE FIND OUT

00:12.934 --> 00:15.100
I'M NOT A BASKETBALL
PLAYER'S SON.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.200
MY DAD IS A GROCER.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.500
I'M A GROCER'S SON.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.700
I AM A SON

00:31.467 --> 00:32.667

00:32.667 --> 00:35.233
THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING
THE SHORT GRAINS.

00:35.233 --> 00:38.667
THROW THEM IN,
FORGET ABOUT IT!

00:40.233 --> 00:42.100

I'M GLAD I'M NOT YOU.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.100
FIRST OF ALL,

00:45.100 --> 00:47.500
THANK YOU TO THE PARENTS
FOR BEING HERE.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.500
AFTER THEY SPEAK, YOU
SHOULD HAVE A BETTER IDEA

00:50.500 --> 00:53.233
OF THE VOCATIONS
THAT INTEREST YOU.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.734
LET ME GUESS, HUNTER--
SUMMER VOCATION?

00:57.233 --> 00:58.567

01:04.367 --> 01:06.700
THANK YOU, MR. TURNER.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.967
I'LL BEGIN BY TELLING
EVERYBODY WHAT I DO.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.200
I'M A LUTHIER.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.600
AND I'M
A PRESBYTERIAN,

01:11.600 --> 01:13.834
BUT TO EACH HIS OWN,
I SAY.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.100
A LUTHIER MAKES
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.600
NO OFFENSE, SIR,

01:18.600 --> 01:20.300
BUT THAT'S THE
NUTTIEST RELIGION
I EVER HEARD.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.367
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT YOU.

01:25.767 --> 01:26.767
DADDY,
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.000
TELL THEM WHO CALLED
LAST NIGHT.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.200
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THAT, TIPPY.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.233
TIPPY?
TIPPY?

01:32.233 --> 01:34.300

01:44.600 --> 01:46.033
UH-HUH.
I TOOK THE CALL.

01:46.033 --> 01:49.200
HE SAID,
"HEY, LITTLE GIRL,
IS YOUR DADDY HOME?"

01:49.200 --> 01:52.500
SO, YOU MAKE GUITARS
FOR BIG ROCK STARS?

01:52.500 --> 01:55.300
MOST OF THEM.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.600
He makes 'em,
but can he play 'em?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.100
BUT MY REAL LOVE IS
PLAYING THESE THINGS.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.400
CORY'S FATHER
IS A GROCER.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.900
YOU PROBABLY THINK
ALL HE'S GOING
TO TALK ABOUT

02:37.900 --> 02:41.033
IS HOW MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF RICE HE STOCKS.

02:41.033 --> 02:45.500
I'M SURE THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT. ALAN?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.033
AHEM. WELL, UH...

02:49.033 --> 02:52.000

02:56.734 --> 03:00.834
I TAKE PRIDE
IN WHAT I DO.

03:00.834 --> 03:01.834
AHEM.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.133
EVERYBODY NEEDS GROCERIES.

03:04.367 --> 03:05.767
I'D LIKE TO THINK

03:05.767 --> 03:09.500
WE DO MORE THAN SELL LETTUCE
AND PICKLES AND POTATO CHIPS

03:09.500 --> 03:11.000
AND BUG SPRAY.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.467

03:45.233 --> 03:49.300
NOT FOR ME--
I GOT 60 CENTS
OFF APPLE JACKS.

OUR NEXT PARENT IS--

03:51.667 --> 03:53.500
SORRY I'M LATE!

03:53.500 --> 03:56.500

TO BOTH OF THEM.

YOUR FINGER ON WHAT I DO.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.600
[HOARSE]
SORRY.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.367
MOSTLY I BUY
AND SELL THINGS.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.900
SOMETIMES A REFRIGERATOR,

04:45.900 --> 04:47.000
SOMETIMES A CAR.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.600
ONCE I EVEN SOLD
AN ENTIRE NATION.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.233
BUT WHAT I SELL BEST
ARE IDEAS.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.000
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.200
I'M AN IDEA MAN.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.400
A FEW YEARS AGO,

04:56.400 --> 04:59.000
I HAD AN IDEA
FOR AN ALL NEWS TV STATION.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.900
GOING ALL THE TIME,
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.300
YOU INVENTED CNN?

05:02.300 --> 05:04.867

WHAT I CALLED IT. CNN.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.367
CHET'S NEWS NETWORK.

05:06.367 --> 05:09.934

YAPPING TO A SOUTHERN FELLA

05:09.934 --> 05:12.200
ABOUT IT ON AN ELEVATOR.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.767

A MICROWAVE OVEN?

SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.900

FOCUSED AND PREPARED.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.033
IT'S LIKE
I'M IN THE S.A.T. ZONE.

COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

AAH!

06:09.967 --> 06:10.934
AAH!

06:12.500 --> 06:15.000
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT--
THAT WORLD SERIES GAME

06:15.000 --> 06:16.200
WHERE THE FIRST BASEMAN

06:16.200 --> 06:18.667
LET THAT GROUND BALL
GO UNDER HIS LEGS,

06:18.667 --> 06:21.367
AND HIS TEAM LOST,
AND HE WAS HUMILIATED

06:21.367 --> 06:23.600
IN FRONT
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.100
I ENVY HIS SON.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.100
EVERYONE LOVED HIM,

06:36.100 --> 06:37.700
AND HE TOLD GREAT STORIES.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.767
STORIES.
IT'S ALL HE HAS.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.567
THAT'S WHY WE LIVE
IN A TRAILER PARK.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.667
AT LEAST NOBODY'S
LAUGHING AT HIM.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.300

08:01.133 --> 08:03.200
THIS TIME
SHE TOOK THE HOUSE.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.600

GO TO COLLEGE.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.734
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO?

09:37.734 --> 09:39.867
BECAUSE SOMEDAY YOUR
SON'LL HAVE A CAREER DAY.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.500
IF YOU DON'T GO TO COLLEGE,

09:41.500 --> 09:44.133
YOUR SON'S TEACHER'LL
STAND UP IN FRONT
OF THE COOL PARENTS

09:44.133 --> 09:47.567
AND SAY,
"HERE'S THE GROCER!"

09:47.567 --> 09:50.200
GO TO COLLEGE.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.834
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.233
WHY TRY?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

09:53.233 --> 09:54.567
WE'RE ALL GOING
TO DIE ANYWAY.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.000
WELL, AREN'T WE NIHILISTIC?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.300
OR SHOULD I SAY VACUITOUS?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.400
IF YOU'RE SO SMART,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.000
HOW COME YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND "SHUT UP"?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.734
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
DAD?

10:04.734 --> 10:06.133
I'M GOING TO BE O.K.

10:06.133 --> 10:07.734
I DON'T NEED COLLEGE.

10:07.734 --> 10:08.867
I'LL DO VERY WELL

10:08.867 --> 10:10.767
RELYING ON
MY NATURAL INSTINCTS.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.567
AHH! AAH!

10:12.567 --> 10:14.300
AAH! AAH!

10:15.467 --> 10:16.900
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ERIC?

10:16.900 --> 10:19.133
OH, HE PUT HIS HAND
ON THE STOVE.

10:19.133 --> 10:20.100
AGAIN?

10:21.767 --> 10:23.800
WAHH HA HA!

10:23.800 --> 10:26.600
MY FAULT.
I LEFT THE IRON ON.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.467
SO, TELL ME.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.500
HOW DID CAREER DAY GO?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.600
OH, TERRIFIC.
REMEMBER THE WORLD SERIES

10:32.600 --> 10:35.900
WHERE THAT FIRST BASEMEN
LET THAT GROUNDER
DRIBBLE THROUGH HIS LEGS?

10:35.900 --> 10:37.233
I ENVY HIM.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.467
IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE
THAT BAD.

10:39.467 --> 10:40.600
I HAVE WORKED VERY HARD

10:40.600 --> 10:42.867
TO BECOME
A RESPECTABLE FAMILY MAN.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.100
THIS MORNING, I REALIZED

10:44.100 --> 10:46.233
I PASSED WAY BEYOND
RESPECTABILITY.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.800
I'VE SOARED ALL THE
WAY UP TO BORING.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.100
SAYS WHO?

10:50.100 --> 10:52.400
AMY, I MANAGE A SUPERMARKET.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.000
I SIGN FOR DELIVERIES.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.600
I APPROVE CHECKS.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.400
THAT'S WHAT
YOU DO AT WORK,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.800
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
OF WHAT YOU DO.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.567
BESIDES, WOULD
I HAVE MARRIED YOU

11:01.567 --> 11:02.700
IF YOU WERE BORING?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.834
APPARENTLY.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.834
I'LL BET CORY'S
VERY PROUD OF YOU

11:06.834 --> 11:08.100
AND HE CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL YOU.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.734
DAD...

11:09.734 --> 11:11.033
WHAT?

11:11.033 --> 11:13.000
DID SHAWN CALL?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.567
UH, NO, COR. WHY?

11:14.567 --> 11:15.600
SOMETHING WRONG?

11:15.600 --> 11:18.100
YEAH, HIS MOM TOOK OFF.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.000
HE WENT WITH HIS DAD
TO GO LOOK FOR HER.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
POOR SHAWN.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.133
HASN'T THIS HAPPENED BEFORE?

11:23.133 --> 11:26.133
YEAH, BUT THIS TIME
SHE TOOK HIS HOUSE.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.400
NOT A GOOD SIGN.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.700
AAH!

11:31.967 --> 11:34.734
ALSO NOT A GOOD SIGN.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.834
HE'S FINE.
YOUR SON IS FINE.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.467
HE JUST NEEDS SOME ICE.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.700
SEE? JUST AS I PROMISED.

11:47.700 --> 11:48.900
NO STUDENT CONFERENCES,

11:48.900 --> 11:51.734
NO GEORGE FEENY
TELLING US WHAT TO DO.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.934
JUST MUSIC, WINE...

11:53.934 --> 11:55.700
CANDLES...

11:55.700 --> 11:58.367
AND TWO CONSENTING ADULTS...

11:58.367 --> 11:59.934
CONSENTING.

11:59.934 --> 12:01.400
YOU KNOW, JOHNNY,

12:01.400 --> 12:04.900
WE'VE BEEN SEEING
EACH OTHER NOW
FOR THREE MONTHS.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.033
AND I WAS
JUST WONDERING.

12:07.033 --> 12:08.900
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.033
COLD.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.800
I'M COLD. ARE YOU COLD?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.500
THIS TIME WE'RE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.800
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
NO MORE AVOIDING IT.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.300
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:20.700 --> 12:23.300
I DID NOT PLAN THIS.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.000
HI. MR. TURNER.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.967
SORRY FOR BUGGING YOU.

12:27.967 --> 12:29.467
I HAD A QUESTION.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.200
AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.100
HEY, LOOK,
IT'S MISS TOMPKINS.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.700
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.100
BOY, YOU TEACHERS
SURE WORK LATE.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.734
OH.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.400
SORRY.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.600
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
HAD PERSONAL LIVES.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
HUNTER.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.233
HOW YOU DOING?

12:51.667 --> 12:53.233
YOU WANT TO COME IN?

12:53.233 --> 12:55.200
YOU GOT COMPANY.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.834
IT'S O.K.

12:56.834 --> 12:58.000
KAT, WHERE YOU GOING?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.200
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.
STAY. WE'LL HANG.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.500
ANOTHER TIME.

13:03.900 --> 13:04.900
WE'LL TALK.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.300
WE'LL TALK?

13:07.867 --> 13:09.700
I LIKE HER.

13:09.700 --> 13:10.700
DO YOU LIKE HER?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.600
I LIKE HER.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.700
YEAH, I DO.

13:13.700 --> 13:17.100
SO, HUNTER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT SO LATE?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.867
WELL, YOU KNOW, UM...

13:18.867 --> 13:21.700
MY DAD'S STILL OUT
LOOKING FOR MY MOM,

13:21.700 --> 13:24.467
AND I HAD THIS THOUGHT.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.000
O.K.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.567
ABOUT THE HOMEWORK.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.100
YOU KNOW THAT
FORREST HEMINGWAY GUY?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.500
WHEN DO WE GET
TO READ HIS STUFF?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.500
NEXT YEAR.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
O.K.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.667
JUST CHECKING.
I HEARD HE WAS GOOD.

13:37.667 --> 13:41.100
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE FOR THAT?

13:41.100 --> 13:43.300
YOU'RE
THE ENGLISH TEACHER.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.400
I FIGURED THERE WAS
NO ONE ELSE I COULD ASK.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.867
I'M FLATTERED.

13:47.867 --> 13:49.834
BOY, YOU GUYS WERE REALLY
HAVING A DINNER, HUH?

13:49.834 --> 13:51.367
THERE'S PLENTY LEFT OVER
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

13:51.367 --> 13:52.934
NO, I ATE AND EVERYTHING.

13:52.934 --> 13:53.934
PUT IT AWAY?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.667
NO. I MIGHT PICK AT IT.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.233
WOULD A NAPKIN
SLOW YOU DOWN?

14:05.367 --> 14:07.000
SO, SHAWN,
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING

14:07.000 --> 14:08.100
UNTIL YOUR
FATHER GETS BACK?

14:08.100 --> 14:10.000
MY DAD GAVE ME MONEY,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.767
SO I'M STAYING AT THE MOTEL
DOWN THE STREET.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.834
THE ONE DOWN ON SEVENTH?

14:14.834 --> 14:16.133
ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL BE
ALL RIGHT THERE?

14:16.133 --> 14:18.834
OH, YEAH. THE GUY
IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE

14:18.834 --> 14:20.133
GAVE ME CLEAN SHEETS
AND EVERYTHING.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.367
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY,
YOU CAN CRASH HERE TONIGHT.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.967
NO. I ALREADY PAID THE GUY
5 BUCKS TO TURN ON THE TV.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.867
HAVE A SEAT.
WATCH SOME FREE TV.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.400
GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO CLEAN UP,

14:34.400 --> 14:35.700
AND I'LL DROP YOU OFF.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.967
O.K.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.300
YOU KNOW, HUNTER,

14:41.300 --> 14:44.100
SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE
STAYING DOWN THE ROAD,

14:44.100 --> 14:45.567
FEEL FREE TO DROP BY.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.200
YOU KNOW, WE COULD EAT.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.834
WE COULD TALK...

14:48.834 --> 14:49.967
OR NOT TALK.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.834
WE COULD JUST HANG,
YOU KNOW.

14:51.834 --> 14:55.800
WHAT'S GOING ON AT HOME
CAN'T BE EASY ON YOU.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.400
SO, SHAWN, YOU KNOW,
ANYTIME, YOU JUST--

15:07.734 --> 15:09.367
I TALK, HE SLEEPS.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.834
IT'S LIKE CLASS.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.100
GEORGE, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.133
HIS OLD MAN
DUMPS HIM OFF

15:24.133 --> 15:25.400
AT THIS
FLEABAG MOTEL.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.934
I WASN'T ABOUT
TO WAKE HIM UP
AND TAKE HIM BACK.

15:27.934 --> 15:30.000
WHERE IS HE NOW?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.400
I DROPPED HIM OFF
AT THE MATTHEWS'.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.300
I'M SURE SHAWN'S FATHER--

15:33.300 --> 15:37.000
FRIGHTENING MAN, ISN'T HE?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.400
I'M SURE HE'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND HIS WAY BACK HOME.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.100
AFTER ALL,
IF A PIGEON CAN DO IT...

15:42.100 --> 15:43.767
BUT I WOULD BE CAREFUL.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.233
THERE'S A FINE LINE

15:45.233 --> 15:47.834
BETWEEN AUTHORITY
FIGURE AND CHUM.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.133
I KNOW THAT, GEORGE,
BUT, COME ON, REALLY.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.133
WHAT WOULD
YOU HAVE DONE?

15:53.467 --> 15:54.934
I TRULY DON'T KNOW.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.867
HEY, GUYS.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.100
OFFICE HOURS?

15:59.100 --> 16:01.133
GOOD MORNING, ALAN.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.900
THANKS AGAIN
FOR HELPING OUT
AT CAREER DAY.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.934
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TERRIFIC.

16:04.934 --> 16:07.900
ANYTIME. THOSE KIDS
GET ROWDY, JUST CALL ME.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.400
I'LL BE HAPPY TO SWING BY
AND SEDATE THEM.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.133
TRY IT FOR 40 YEARS
AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.800
ALAN,
COULD YOU COME IN?

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
IN A MINUTE.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.100
NOW, PLEASE.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.467
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:19.467 --> 16:21.600
CHET HUNTER IS HERE.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.200
AMY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.700
I'M NOT LAUGHING EITHER.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.100
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

16:26.100 --> 16:28.033
THERE'S A COUPLE
OF THINGS I'D LIKE
TO SAY TO HIM.

16:28.033 --> 16:31.000
SURE, COME ON.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
JONATHAN.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
YEAH?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.367
IT'S A FINE LINE.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.734
TREAD SOFTLY.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.100
YEAH.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.767
SO WHERE ARE YOU
STAYING TONIGHT?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.734
UH, THE MOTEL'S FINE.
AT LEAST 'TIL MY DAD GETS BACK.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.000
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER TONIGHT?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.100
WE COULD SKATEBOARD IN
THE POOL, WATCH CABLE.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.233
WE GOT CABLE.

16:48.233 --> 16:51.133
NOT LIKE THIS PLACE.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.800
YOU CAN'T JUST LIVE
IN A MOTEL.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.500
WHY NOT? AT LEAST YOU KNOW
IT WON'T DRIVE AWAY.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.200
YOU COULD HAVE
CRASHED HERE
LAST NIGHT.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.033
I KNOW. I WAS FINE.

17:02.033 --> 17:03.600
I KNOW YOU'RE FINE.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.133
I'M JUST SAYING.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.300
I DON'T KNOW.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.567
JUST REMEMBER
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

17:08.567 --> 17:11.000
I KNOW. IT'S O.K., CORY.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.934
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

17:12.934 --> 17:15.200
HEY, SHAWN!
COME ON DOWN, SON!

17:15.200 --> 17:17.467
SEE? MY DAD'S BACK,
AND EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.834
WHAT YOU DID
FOR MY BOY LAST NIGHT--

17:22.834 --> 17:25.567
I JUST WANT TO LOOK YOU
IN THE EYE AND SAY THANKS.

17:25.567 --> 17:26.500
THANKS.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.400
YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.767
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS KNOWING

17:30.767 --> 17:33.100
MY BOY'S SAFE AND BEING
LOOKED AFTER.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.300
HEY, DAD, DID YOU FIND MOM?

17:35.300 --> 17:37.033
I DID. I DID FIND HER,

17:37.033 --> 17:39.767
BUT SHE GAVE ME
THE SLIP AGAIN.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.867
YOU GOT TO RESPECT THAT.

17:40.867 --> 17:42.367
UNTIL THAT END,

17:42.367 --> 17:43.734
I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY MIND,

17:43.734 --> 17:45.734
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.734
I THOUGHT I WAS
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.800
YOU ARE,
YOU LITTLE SLIM JIM.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.400
THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOU.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.767
SHAWNY, LOOK.

17:53.767 --> 17:56.600
UH, THIS IS HARD TO SAY.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.500
I AIN'T ALWAYS BEEN
THE PERFECT FATHER.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.400
DAD, IT'S O.K.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.767
ADAM...

18:02.767 --> 18:04.967
I CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.100
ALAN.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.300
I RESPECT YOU.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.967
YOU'RE THE HEARTBEAT
OF AMERICA.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.000
PEOPLE CAN COUNT ON YOU.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.500
YOU GOT ROOTS.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.033
I LIKE THAT.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.367
WHERE'S THIS HEADING?

18:15.367 --> 18:16.867
I NEED A FAVOR.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.300
MY WIFE, VERN, SHE'S--

18:19.300 --> 18:20.767
SHE'S OUT THERE.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.300
MY HEART'S OUT THERE
WITH HER,

18:23.300 --> 18:24.867
NOT TO MENTION MY WALLET

18:24.867 --> 18:27.734
AND MAJOR CREDIT CARD.

18:27.734 --> 18:29.100
BUT SHE IS MY WIFE,

18:29.100 --> 18:31.300
AND GO AFTER HER, I MUST.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.133
AND THE FAVOR?

18:33.133 --> 18:34.734
TAKE CARE OF MY BOY.

18:34.734 --> 18:36.867
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.100
WELL, YES, YOU DO.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.934
STAY HERE? THAT'D BE GREAT.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.300
DAD, WHY CAN'T I
JUST COME WITH YOU?

18:43.300 --> 18:46.367
THE ROAD'S NO PLACE
FOR A BOY,

18:46.367 --> 18:49.800
ESPECIALLY WITH
YOUR MAMA OUT THERE
DRIVING ON IT.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.000
YOUR PLACE IS HERE,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.500
IN SCHOOL...

18:52.500 --> 18:54.000
WITH TEACH OVER THERE,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.100
IN THIS HOUSE,

18:55.100 --> 18:57.367
IN THE COMPANY
OF THESE FINE PEOPLE.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.934
NO PRESSURE.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.500
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
ASKING SHAWN
WHAT HE THINKS?

19:02.500 --> 19:05.000
WHATEVER.
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.834
WE'RE ONLY TALKING
A FEW DAYS, COUPLE
OF WEEKS TOPS.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.900
I'LL CALL IN
EVERY NIGHT.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.000
SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT,
YOUR HONOR,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.200
MRS. HONOR?

19:14.200 --> 19:17.667
SHAWN, WE'D BE
VERY HAPPY TO
HAVE YOU STAY.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.200
HONEY.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.867
SHAWN, YOU HAVE A ROOM HERE
AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

19:23.867 --> 19:26.667
IF MY BOY CAN'T BE
WITH HIS OWN FATHER,

19:26.667 --> 19:29.667
I'M GLAD HE CAN BE
WITH A GOOD FATHER,

19:29.667 --> 19:32.400
AND, YOU, SIR,
WHY, YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER.

19:33.934 --> 19:35.200
HE'S FINE. DON'T PANIC.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.000
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE NOSEBLEED.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.600
HOW LONG HAS THAT TREE
BEEN OUT THERE?

19:43.934 --> 19:46.500
WELL, ANYWAY, ALAN,

19:46.500 --> 19:48.567
IF I CAN KICK IN
TO THE HOUSE KITTY,

19:48.567 --> 19:49.667
LET ME KNOW.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.800
WE CAN HANDLE IT.
WE GET COUPONS.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.100
EVEN BETTER. HA HA!

19:54.100 --> 19:56.567
WELL, SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO MOVE YOUR STUFF?

19:56.567 --> 19:59.033
OH, WAIT, IT'S
ALREADY MOVING.

19:59.033 --> 20:01.367
LET'S GO GET YOU
A TOOTHBRUSH
AND A NEW SHIRT.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.734
TEACH...

20:04.033 --> 20:05.100
MA'AM...

20:05.100 --> 20:06.667
MR. MATTHEWS...

20:06.667 --> 20:08.467
IT'S CORKY, RIGHT?

20:10.233 --> 20:12.000
YEAH.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.567
HEY, WE'RE GOING
TO BE ROOMMATES, HUH?

20:13.567 --> 20:15.033
HOW GREAT IS THAT?

20:15.033 --> 20:16.767
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.367
I'LL GO GET
SOME CLEAN SHEETS.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.967
UH, CHET.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.600
YOU'LL BE BACK IN
A COUPLE OF WEEKS?

20:22.600 --> 20:26.133
TEXAS WOMEN COULDN'T
KEEP ME FROM HERE.

20:27.667 --> 20:28.867
YOU KNOW, ALAN.

20:28.867 --> 20:31.700
CHET WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.133
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.133
DAD?

20:37.133 --> 20:38.133
HMM?

20:38.133 --> 20:39.400
UH, LISTEN.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.300
I NEVER REALLY THANKED YOU

20:41.300 --> 20:43.200
FOR COMING TO SCHOOL
YESTERDAY.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.600
AH, NO PROBLEM.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.000
SORRY I COULDN'T
COMPETE WITH THAT
GUITAR PLAYER

20:47.000 --> 20:48.400
AND
THAT FOOT DOCTOR.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.500
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE

20:49.500 --> 20:52.100
YOU LEFT OUT THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING YOU DO--

20:52.100 --> 20:53.100
WHAT'S THAT?

20:53.100 --> 20:55.200
WHAT YOU DO AFTER WORK...

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
AROUND HERE...

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
FOR US...

20:57.200 --> 20:58.200
FOR FRIENDS.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.200
THAT'S NOTHING.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.300
IT'S EVERYTHING, DAD.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.800
I WAS THINKING I WAS
THE SON OF A GROCER,

21:03.800 --> 21:07.000
BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT
I REALLY AM IS...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.467
WELL, THE SON OF MY FATHER.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.400
THANKS.

21:20.734 --> 21:22.934
I'M REVELING
IN THE MASTICATION

21:22.934 --> 21:25.700
OF THESE TASTY
COMESTIBLES.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.500
SUPERLATIVE VICTUALS.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.300
AND THE LIBATIONS...

21:30.300 --> 21:33.900
YA-HAH!
YA-HAH!

21:33.900 --> 21:36.700
LOOKS LIKE YOUR S.A.T.
PREPARATION IS UNDER CONTROL.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.200
TOTALLY COPACETIC.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.233
I'M CALMER.
MY SENSES ARE BACK.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.800
I'M HEALING.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
I'M ACTUALLY
STARTING TO THINK

21:43.800 --> 21:45.700
I'M GOING TO DO
PRETTY WELL.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.400
THE PART THAT SCARES ME
IS THAT MATH SECTION.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.400
UH, COME AGAIN?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.000
HALF THE TEST IS VERBAL.
HALF IS MATH.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.367
HALF?

21:56.367 --> 21:58.700
LIKE WHAT, 30-40%?

21:58.700 --> 22:00.800
HALF.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.767
50.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.500
I GOT TO STUDY.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.900
ERIC, ERIC, CALM DOWN.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.300
NO, CAN'T CALM.
MUST PANIC.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.867
I HATE S.A.T. TIME.
