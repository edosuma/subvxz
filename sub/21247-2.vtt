Just be careful
on that ledge.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.430
Hmm... Yes.
It is rather dry.

01:35.460 --> 01:38.230
Well, the dry season
is on its way.

01:38.270 --> 01:41.370
Pfft! One dry hillside's

Okay, Mom.
I'll be home soon.

I should come home

Mom?

02:03.160 --> 02:04.320
You see his mom

02:04.360 --> 02:07.290
Nope. And it's kinda hard
to miss an elephant.

02:07.330 --> 02:09.460
Oh! They're using
infrasound!

02:09.500 --> 02:12.460

But Mtoto's not a baby!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.470
Not infant sound.
Infrasound!

can talk
using sounds

I bet he's trying
to spoil the summit!

about the Circle of Life.

I was invited.

04:05.380 --> 04:06.980
You were?

04:07.010 --> 04:10.050
That's right, Kion.
I invited him myself.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.350
Oh...

04:11.380 --> 04:14.190
And I appreciate
the invitation.

You'll see that I take
my responsibility

Very seriously.

I trust him.

Can I talk to you?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.100

All right.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.100
Excuse us.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.270

going anywhere.

Dad, you know we've had
a lot of trouble with Makuu.

04:40.350 --> 04:41.480
I don't trust him.

04:41.510 --> 04:45.250
The crocodiles are a part
of the Pride Lands, Kion.

04:45.290 --> 04:47.190
And Makuu
is their leader.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.420
Yeah, but to invite him
to the Savannah Summit?

04:50.460 --> 04:52.490
With all these other
peaceful animals?

(GRUNTS)

04:54.130 --> 04:56.130

04:56.160 --> 05:00.330
Crocodiles have
always been invited
to the Savannah Summit.

05:00.370 --> 05:04.070
Maybe that worked with Pua,
the old crocodile leader.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.240
But Makuu?

05:05.270 --> 05:07.210
He's got more enemies
than friends.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.240
Kion, you don't have summits
just to talk to your friends.

05:11.280 --> 05:15.180
You have summits
to help turn conflict
into friendship.

05:15.220 --> 05:16.310
To build trust.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.150
I think Makuu is ready.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.090
Sire, it's time
for the procession.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.320
Thank you, Zazu.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.990
And Kion?

05:25.030 --> 05:27.330
I still need you
and the Guard
to be on alert.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.460
In case the other animals
aren't ready to accept Makuu.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.300
Okay, Dad. Sure.

have done!

05:47.450 --> 05:49.050
Yes.

He's down

And he sounds really mad!

All we crocodiles do
during the dry season

Right! You'll pretend
to be sleeping,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.380
so we'll let down

supposed to be about

Good faith?

08:56.140 --> 08:57.300
On it, Kion.

08:57.340 --> 08:59.440
Why don't you both
take a deep breath

08:59.470 --> 09:01.170
before you say something,

09:01.210 --> 09:03.370
or eat something
you'll regret?

I was trying
to talk to him.

talking to a jumpy antelope.

I won't let anyone ruin
the Savannah Summit.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.390
Especially you.

Especially me?

09:22.160 --> 09:23.960
Fine.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.360
I don't want any trouble.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.030
He'll think twice
before tangling
with an antelope.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.240
That was close.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.300
Oh, yeah!

09:33.340 --> 09:35.410
Simba would be pretty upset
if his summit ended

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
with Makuu eating
Bupu for lunch.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.180

09:39.210 --> 09:41.010

Huh? Oh, sure.
Glad to help.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.250
Hey, Mtoto.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.050
You think you could
keep your ears open

09:47.090 --> 09:48.290
for the rest
of the summit?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
Let us know if you hear
anything suspicious?

09:50.360 --> 09:51.390
Yes, sir!

I'm pretty sure
Makuu's up to something.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.030
So we need to be ready
for any sign of trouble.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.060
All of us.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
Gotta listen.
Gotta listen.

did Twiga say about Makuu?

I'm not sure!

10:17.180 --> 10:18.320
It couldn't have
been good!

10:18.350 --> 10:20.480
Everyone knows crocs
and giraffes don't mix!

10:20.520 --> 10:23.290
(GASPS) I'll bet
Makuu's going to
attack Twiga!

10:23.320 --> 10:25.090
And ruin the summit.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.460
I bet that's what
Makuu's been planning
all along!

10:27.490 --> 10:29.290
'Til the Pride Lands' end...

10:29.330 --> 10:31.230
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

10:36.100 --> 10:37.230
Back off, Makuu!

10:39.170 --> 10:40.440
"Makuu?"

10:40.470 --> 10:43.110
Don't worry, Twiga,
I'll protect ya'.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.140
From what?

10:44.180 --> 10:45.480
From Makuu!

10:45.510 --> 10:47.480
Where is he?
No Makuu here.

10:47.510 --> 10:49.250
But Mtoto heard him!

10:49.280 --> 10:51.080
Uh, well, no.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.320
I heard Twiga
talking about Makuu.

10:53.350 --> 10:56.150
Me? I wasn't talking
about Makuu.

10:56.190 --> 10:57.250
Were you talking
about Makuu?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.120
No, why would I
talk about Makuu?

10:59.160 --> 11:00.190
How should I know?

11:00.230 --> 11:02.160
I'm just eating branches.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.100
Like a giraffe does.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.400
Me, too.
Delicious branches.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.240
Uh, Vuruga Vuruga?

11:12.270 --> 11:14.110
Aren't you more
of a grass eater?

11:14.140 --> 11:15.240
(SWALLOWS)

11:15.270 --> 11:18.040
Buffalo eat
whatever we want.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.310
Uh, okay.

11:19.350 --> 11:21.410
So, Twiga,
you're all right?

11:21.450 --> 11:23.050
Oh, yes. Fine.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.020
Totally fine.
Thanks for asking.

11:25.050 --> 11:28.420
Now, I'm sure there are
more important matters at the
summit for you to attend to.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.120
Yeah. Let's go.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.390
That was strange,
right?

11:35.430 --> 11:37.190
We did interrupt
their lunch.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.230
I don't think
it was that, Little B.

11:39.270 --> 11:41.070
They seemed
real nervous.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.170
Especially any time
we mentioned Makuu.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.500
Hmm. What if
he threatened them,

11:45.540 --> 11:48.070
and they're too
afraid to tell us?

11:48.110 --> 11:49.110
To tell us?

11:49.140 --> 11:50.470
But we're the Lion Guard.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.510
That's how much
he must've scared them.

11:52.550 --> 11:55.180
Just having Makuu here
is hurting the summit.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.380
Good thing Mtoto can hear
if anything bad's happening.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.420
Yeah! I wish I could
hear like you, Mtoto.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.090
It'd be
un-Bunga-lievable!

12:03.120 --> 12:04.390
I'll do my best.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.060
ZAZU: (SQUAWKING)<i> Help!</i>

12:07.090 --> 12:09.330
Hey! I'm getting
the hang of this!
I just heard...

12:09.360 --> 12:11.100
Zazu!
Yeah, but...

12:11.130 --> 12:12.230
We all heard him.

12:12.270 --> 12:13.300
This way.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.030
(RAFIKI LAUGHING)

12:16.070 --> 12:18.000
Mbeya,
you must get up!

12:18.040 --> 12:21.170
I cannot finish the portrait
with you sitting down.

12:21.210 --> 12:23.110
KION: Where's Zazu?
Is he in trouble?

12:23.140 --> 12:24.340
(GASPS)
Did Makuu eat him?

12:24.380 --> 12:28.280
(LAUGHS) Perhaps,
Zazu himself can explain.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.450
Eh, Zazu?

12:29.480 --> 12:31.320
ZAZU: Not funny,
Rafiki!

12:31.350 --> 12:33.180
At least, you're
right about that.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.220
I'm not getting off
until you apologize, Zazu.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.360
ZAZU: Apologize? Me?

12:39.390 --> 12:42.230
I'm the one with
a rhinoceros on his head.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.300
You think this is what
the King meant

12:44.330 --> 12:46.430
when he asked us to look out
for trouble at the summit?

12:46.470 --> 12:48.030
Not exactly.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.030
He called me clumsy.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.040
No, he didn't.
I did.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.300
Uh, Rafiki?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.470
(LAUGHING)

12:55.510 --> 12:57.270
No, no, Kion.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.340
It is the Lion Guard
that must get to the...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.250
(LAUGHING)

13:02.280 --> 13:05.020
...bottom of the situation.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.150
(LAUGHING)
"Bottom!" I get it.

13:08.190 --> 13:11.060
(SIGHS) Will someone
just tell me
what happened?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.090
I was having
a perfectly nice time

13:13.130 --> 13:17.030
when suddenly this...
This hippo with a horn
bumps into me.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.360
Who are you
calling a hippo?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.260
I'm a rhino,
you baboon!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.030
Who are you
calling a baboon?

13:22.070 --> 13:24.000
You are a baboon.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.300
Oh. Right.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.200
ZAZU: (MUFFLED) What does
it matter what happened?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.170
Just get off of me.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.470
(GASPING)

13:30.510 --> 13:32.210
Daylight!

13:32.250 --> 13:35.210
(SIGHS) I thought
I'd never see you again!

13:35.250 --> 13:39.480
Hey, Mbeya, looks like
you have some hornbill
stuck on your backside!

13:39.520 --> 13:41.350
Come on, everyone.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.020
It was just an accident.

13:43.060 --> 13:45.190
You're right.
Sorry, Mbeya.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.320
Uh... That's okay.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.360
Sorry I sat on you,
Zazu.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.030
(GRUNTING)
Quite all right.

13:53.070 --> 13:57.100
Rafiki, please tell me
this won't make it into
the official portrait.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.370
(LAUGHING)
Not the official one.

14:00.410 --> 14:03.140
Lion Guard, Lion Guard!
It's Makuu!

14:03.180 --> 14:05.980
MAKUU: (MUFFLED)
<i> All right, Bupu,</i>
<i> I've heard enough!</i>

14:06.010 --> 14:07.280
I think
he's at Pride Rock!

14:07.310 --> 14:09.110
And he's yelling
at Bupu again!

14:09.150 --> 14:10.250
Let's go!

14:11.250 --> 14:12.420
That's right, Bupu!

14:12.450 --> 14:14.180
You've got a...
(GRUNTS)

14:14.220 --> 14:15.220
Gotcha!
(GROANS)

14:15.250 --> 14:17.290
Kion! What are you doing?

14:17.320 --> 14:19.060
Dad? We heard...

14:19.090 --> 14:20.260
(GRUNTS)

14:20.290 --> 14:22.390
You heard us
negotiating, cub!

14:22.430 --> 14:24.330
We were just about
to reach an agreement

14:24.360 --> 14:28.470
for the crocodiles to
sleep by the antelopes'
watering hole.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.270
Now, Bupu, Makuu,
if we can just...
Forget it!

14:32.310 --> 14:35.240
How can I trust any of you
if you don't trust me?

14:35.270 --> 14:37.470
This whole summit's
a joke!

14:37.510 --> 14:40.240
But Makuu,
we were so close.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.480
Don't worry, Bupu.
We can try again.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.050
With all due respect,
your highness,
I don't see the point.

14:48.090 --> 14:49.320
I've done my best.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.160
But negotiating is obviously
not the crocodile way.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.360
That's not true.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.160
(SIGHS)

14:57.230 --> 14:59.030
We talked about this, Kion.

14:59.070 --> 15:02.200
I know, Dad.
But there's something
going on!

15:02.230 --> 15:03.970
I'm not sure what,
but Makuu...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.440
Is a new leader.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.440
I need to
build his trust.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.170
That's why I included
him in the summit.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.110
But he just
wants to ruin it!

15:12.140 --> 15:13.380
You may have
ruined it.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.280
I...

15:15.310 --> 15:16.350
I'm sorry, Dad.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.280
Then find a way
to fix it.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.180
I have to get back
to Mizimu Grove

15:20.220 --> 15:23.050
and salvage what I can
of the summit.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.120
BESHTE: You okay, Kion?

15:26.160 --> 15:28.260
That sounded intense.
I'll say.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.260
What's Simba
so upset about?

15:30.300 --> 15:32.330
We saw Bupu.
You saved him.

15:32.370 --> 15:34.300
No, I didn't.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.430
Apparently, Bupu
didn't need saving.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.070
He didn't?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.100
You still think something's
going on with Makuu?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.310
I... I don't know.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.140
I need some time
to think.

15:51.180 --> 15:53.020
Grandfather Mufasa?

15:54.350 --> 15:56.250
Yes, Kion?

15:56.290 --> 15:58.490
My Dad is really
upset with me.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.090
And I'm worried that
I ruined his summit.

16:01.130 --> 16:04.030
I didn't mean to.
It's just...

16:04.060 --> 16:07.000
I was so sure Makuu
wanted to ruin it.

16:07.030 --> 16:10.070
And what has Makuu done
to make you think this?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.300
Well, he...

16:11.340 --> 16:13.000
He...

16:13.040 --> 16:14.370
Nothing really.

16:14.410 --> 16:18.080
But I've got this feeling
that something bad's
going to happen.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.340
And that means
stopping Makuu. Right?

16:20.380 --> 16:23.210
Rafiki has a saying
about reaching

16:23.250 --> 16:25.350
conclusions too quickly.

16:25.380 --> 16:29.150
"Leap to conclusions,
and you leap to confusions."

16:29.190 --> 16:30.320
(SIGHS)

16:30.360 --> 16:35.290
Perhaps, you need to figure
out what's truly going on.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.130
Without jumping
to conclusions.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.060
Right. Thank you,
Grandfather.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.230
I'll do my best.

16:41.270 --> 16:43.200
I know you will.

16:46.210 --> 16:47.170
BUNGA: Kion, Kion!

16:49.080 --> 16:51.010
Mtoto just heard
Makuu on the attack!

16:51.040 --> 16:52.280
We gotta go!
What?

16:52.310 --> 16:53.410
Makuu's attacking?

16:53.450 --> 16:55.050
Mtoto?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.350
Well, I heard something
about an attack.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.420
I'm just not sure
who's attacking who...

16:59.450 --> 17:01.120
It's gotta be Makuu!

17:01.150 --> 17:02.250
Who else could it be?

17:02.290 --> 17:04.020
Easy, Bunga.

17:04.060 --> 17:06.089
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

17:06.130 --> 17:08.030
Mtoto, can you
listen again?

(GASPS) They're going
to do it tonight

17:16.000 --> 17:17.369
right after sunset!

17:17.400 --> 17:20.000
Who's going to do
what right after sunset?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.170
I couldn't tell.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.369
Come on, it's Makuu's
big plot!

17:23.410 --> 17:26.180
Whatever it is,
it's happening tonight!

17:26.210 --> 17:28.280
Okay. But so far,

17:28.310 --> 17:30.210
Makuu hasn't done
anything wrong.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.280
Yes. But it seems like
he's been at the center

17:32.320 --> 17:34.150
of everything Mtoto
has heard today.

17:34.190 --> 17:37.190
Yeah, well, he doesn't exactly
get along with anybody.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.460
You're right, Fuli.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.330
Makuu does have
a lot of enemies here.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.260
But he seems like
he wants to change that.

17:44.300 --> 17:47.400
But even if he's
ready to change,

17:47.430 --> 17:50.030
that doesn't mean
everyone else is.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.370
Which means... What?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.310
Of course!

17:55.340 --> 17:57.410
Makuu's not the one
planning something.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.180
He's the target.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.080
Lion Guard,
we've gotta find Makuu
and save him!

Leave me alone, cub!

18:11.360 --> 18:13.220
No Makuu, listen!

18:13.260 --> 18:14.320
You're in danger!

18:14.360 --> 18:16.260
Are you gonna
pounce on me again?

18:16.300 --> 18:20.160
Relax, Makuu.
We're here to protect you!

18:20.200 --> 18:22.300
(SCOFFS) You?
Protect me?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.140
I'm a crocodile!

protect me from?

this a trap?

18:54.070 --> 18:56.000
Not a very good one.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.230
I mean, who's
gonna fall into...

I'm okay.

19:01.210 --> 19:04.310
(SNIFFS)
What's that smell?

19:04.340 --> 19:06.280
I think it's rotten fruit.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.950
(FLIES BUZZING)

19:07.980 --> 19:09.980
(GULPS) Mmm!
It's not that rotten.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.280
So...

19:12.320 --> 19:14.950
Somebody wanted me
to fall into a pit

19:14.990 --> 19:16.420
filled with rotting fruit.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.960
I'm tellin' ya,
it's not that rotten.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.330
Who would do this?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.030
I'm not sure.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.060
But I have an idea
how we can find out.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.170
Animals of
the Savannah Summit,

19:29.200 --> 19:31.270
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.340
(ALL GASP)

19:32.370 --> 19:35.070
I don't know
how to say this, but...

19:35.110 --> 19:36.170
It's about Makuu.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.040
(GASPS)

19:38.080 --> 19:40.180
Earlier this evening,
he fell into a pit.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.210
It was a serious fall.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.080
He tried his best
to get out.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.220
He struggled bravely,
like a true crocodile.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.220
But... (SIGHS)

19:50.260 --> 19:52.390
I'm sorry to say
that Makuu

19:52.420 --> 19:55.360
has completed his journey
through the Circle of Life.

19:55.390 --> 19:58.000
What?
That's horrible.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.300
And we were
so close to a deal...

20:00.330 --> 20:02.200
We never meant
for him to get hurt.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.230
(ALL GASPING)

20:03.270 --> 20:04.330
We just wanted him to fall

20:04.370 --> 20:06.000
into some rotten fruit!

20:06.040 --> 20:07.140
(ALL GASPING)

20:07.170 --> 20:10.470
(SIGHS) For the last time,
it wasn't that rotten!

20:11.410 --> 20:13.040
(ALL GASPING)

20:13.080 --> 20:16.210
You thought you could take me
out with one little pit?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.280
(ALL GASPING)

20:17.320 --> 20:20.320
(GROANS) Enough
with the gasping!

20:20.350 --> 20:21.350
BOTH: Makuu?

20:21.390 --> 20:23.320
Makuu, You're okay!

20:23.360 --> 20:26.160
Bunga, you knew that
all along.

20:26.190 --> 20:27.160
Oh, yeah.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.200
(STUTTERING)
We didn't want to hurt you.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.460
Just make you smell bad.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.130
The way you were
strutting around here,

20:36.170 --> 20:38.440
we wanted to teach
you a lesson.

20:38.470 --> 20:43.070
I came to the summit
to show I'm a good leader,

20:43.110 --> 20:46.410
to help my float
and the Pride Lands,

20:46.450 --> 20:49.380
but none of you
gave me a chance.

20:49.420 --> 20:53.480
Instead, for my efforts,
I get this.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.190
This plot...

20:56.220 --> 20:57.320
(BOTH GASP)

20:58.390 --> 21:01.430
Worthy of a crocodile.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.360
I couldn't have
done it better
myself.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.030
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

21:06.070 --> 21:11.400
I say, let King Simba's
Savannah Summit go on!

21:12.300 --> 21:14.070
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)

21:14.110 --> 21:16.140
Nice work, Kion.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.010
You saved the summit.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
Yeah.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.380
After I almost
ruined it.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.080
BUPU: Makuu.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.180
Perhaps, you and your float
should spend the dry season

21:24.220 --> 21:26.220
sleeping near our
watering hole after all.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.380
What are you
talking about?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.290
The crocs will sleep
by our mud wallow!

21:30.320 --> 21:31.360
No.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.120
I think it should
be near us.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.090
(CHUCKLES)
Excuse me, son.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.430
I need to get
a handle on this

21:36.460 --> 21:38.300
before it gets
out of control.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.430
MTOTO'S MOM:
(MUFFLED)<i> Mtoto.</i>

21:41.470 --> 21:43.370
Mom! I forgot.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.340
I'm on my way home
right now!

21:45.370 --> 21:46.340
Bye, everybody!

21:48.310 --> 21:51.170
Ya know, I'm glad
I can't hear like Mtoto.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.240
I don't want to know
everybody's business!

21:53.280 --> 21:54.480
Just as well.

21:54.510 --> 21:58.180
You'd look pretty silly
with ears that big.

21:58.220 --> 21:59.520
(ALL LAUGHING)
