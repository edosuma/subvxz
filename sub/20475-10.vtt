13:43.531 --> 13:46.534
[protestors shouting]

13:52.540 --> 13:54.125
All right, what's the situation outside?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.419
I know there's a lot riding
on quelling the protest.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.879
I tried to talk to Sam.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.006
But he failed and then gave up.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.134
Come on, you know what's at stake.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.844
I pieced together

14:04.927 --> 14:07.430
what the Hancocks want out of this.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.102
Troy...

14:14.353 --> 14:16.689
I'm sure there's
something else you can do.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.652
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

14:21.736 --> 14:23.529
[all] No one else should die from drink!

14:23.613 --> 14:25.531
Winchester, stop and think!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.533
[all] No one else should die from drink!

14:27.617 --> 14:29.452
-Clifton, what is this?
-Much respect, dawg,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.537
but binge drinking
is the deadliest challenge

14:31.621 --> 14:33.206
facing Winchester,

14:33.289 --> 14:34.749
and the administration
won't acknowledge it.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.917
Nigga, really?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.503
Troy, that's really racist.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.838
And from our
Student Body President, no less.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.466
To think, I voted for you.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.468
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

14:45.551 --> 14:47.178
[all] No one else should die from drink.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.888
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

14:48.971 --> 14:51.140
[all] No one else should die from drink!

14:51.224 --> 14:53.351
What in white hell?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.978
They feel binge drinking
is taking a back seat.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.855
They're "All Lives Mattering" this shit?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.690
This ain't even
what Thane would have wanted.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.193
That motherfucker loved binge drinking.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.195
Sam, it's not too late.
Just come inside, please.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.280
Are you gonna give us the floor
to say what we want?

15:06.364 --> 15:07.782
You know I can't do that.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.409
Then what are you doing, Troy?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.160
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:12.203 --> 15:14.789
Hey, just checking in.
Everything okay?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.207
Uh, where's Troy?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.875
I'll go check on him.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.841
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.801
[all] No one else should die from drink!

15:26.884 --> 15:28.594
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.555
[all] No one else should die from drink!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.348
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:32.432 --> 15:34.142
[all] No one else should die from drink!

15:34.225 --> 15:35.935
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
[all] No one else should die from drink!

15:37.854 --> 15:39.564
[Clifton] Winchester, stop and think!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.023
[all] No one else should die--

15:43.234 --> 15:44.527
I couldn't find him.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.529
What is wrong with that boy?

15:46.612 --> 15:47.947
I've done everything.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.158
I've pushed him. I've brought him in.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.160
Dean, I got this.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.125
Hi. I'm Coco Conners,

15:59.208 --> 16:00.626
and on behalf of CORE

16:00.710 --> 16:02.670
and the entire faculty at Winchester,

16:02.753 --> 16:04.505
I'd like to welcome you.

16:04.589 --> 16:08.593
Tonight we're discussing race
and safety on campus.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.179
While some prefer to rail against a system

16:11.262 --> 16:12.889
-that's trying to help...
-Mm.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.515
...you should all applaud yourselves

16:14.599 --> 16:17.727
for having the courage
to listen as well as speak.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.110
Thank you, Coco.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.696
Now let's open this up for questions.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.699
[audience murmuring]

16:39.499 --> 16:40.750
[mouths word]

16:43.878 --> 16:46.881
Hi. Kelsey Phillips, AP resident,

16:46.964 --> 16:48.674
and I'm a psych major.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.427
-Actually, I wanted to talk about that.
-Kels.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.386
Right.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.974
I wanted to say thank you so much
for my comfort dog.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.227
-Oh, you're welcome.
-[laughs]

16:59.310 --> 17:00.478
Go on.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.647
That's all.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.233
Okay! Anybody with a question?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.567
[audience murmuring]

17:06.651 --> 17:08.402
Yes, you, sir.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.321
[crowd shouting]

17:10.404 --> 17:12.365
Can you feel this? Everyone here for you?

17:12.448 --> 17:13.866
Not everyone.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.743
[Sam] When are you gonna grow up, Troy?

17:15.826 --> 17:18.287
What the fuck is going on? I mean, like--

17:19.121 --> 17:21.165
It's always something with her.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.668
[all] No one else should die from drink!

17:23.751 --> 17:26.045
Reggie, I know it sucks
to want something from someone

17:26.128 --> 17:27.797
they're not willing to give you...

17:29.257 --> 17:31.133
but you got to let it go.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.552
Trust me.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.637
[all] No one else should die from drink!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.514
They're just gonna drown you out out here.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.600
Better to get drowned than to be silenced.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.853
-[feedback whines]
-We pay tuition to this place!

17:42.937 --> 17:45.147
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

17:45.231 --> 17:46.941
[Sam] We pay tuition to this place!

17:47.024 --> 17:48.818
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

17:48.901 --> 17:51.070
We pay tuition to this place!

17:51.153 --> 17:53.489
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

17:54.991 --> 17:57.493
[Sam] We pay tuition to this place!

17:57.577 --> 17:59.078
Uh... [clears throat]

17:59.161 --> 18:01.455
I just have a question that I think

18:01.539 --> 18:03.583
is on everyone's lips.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.043
Why is campus security armed at all?

18:06.127 --> 18:08.004
Well, that's a great question.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.464
As part of our university policy,

18:10.548 --> 18:13.175
we make a promise to our students

18:13.259 --> 18:16.512
and to their parents
to keep everyone safe.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.222
[woman] Reggie didn't feel too safe!

18:18.306 --> 18:21.559
Okay, we're almost out of time.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.603
Oh, no, already?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.022
Surely we could have one more.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.858
One more.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.068
[audience murmuring]

18:41.662 --> 18:43.623
[Coco] Here you go, sweets.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.919
We pay tuition to this place!

18:49.003 --> 18:50.630
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.632
We pay tuition to this place!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.717
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.636
Winchester, stop and think!

18:56.719 --> 18:58.429
[all] No one else should die from drink!

18:58.512 --> 19:00.348
Winchester, stop and think!

19:00.431 --> 19:01.932
[all] No one else should die from drink!

19:02.016 --> 19:04.018
We pay tuition to this place!

19:04.101 --> 19:06.228
[all] Get your guns up out my face!

19:06.312 --> 19:07.813
[Kurt] Black lives matter! So do blue!

19:07.897 --> 19:09.857
We got shit to whine about, too!

19:09.940 --> 19:11.484
Black lives matter! So do blue!

19:11.567 --> 19:13.194
We got shit to whine about, too!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.529
Black lives matter! So do blue!

19:15.613 --> 19:16.781
We got shit to whine about, too!

19:16.864 --> 19:18.783
Oh, for fuck's sake.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.203
[muffled shouting continuing]

19:29.502 --> 19:31.379
Lionel Higgins,

19:31.462 --> 19:32.963
sophomore.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.176
Just a quick question
for President Fletcher.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.471
How much money are we worth to you?

19:42.056 --> 19:43.432
I'm sorry, young man?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.310
-What the fuck is this?
-Taking a stand.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.270
You're stomping
on an already marginalized--

19:48.354 --> 19:49.939
Cut the shit, Sam!

19:50.022 --> 19:53.067
So a few dumb kids offended you
by accident.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.777
Was that worth all of this?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.487
What I hear Lionel saying is--

19:56.570 --> 20:02.410
There are 234 black undergrads
on this campus.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.870
That's roughly $55 million,

20:04.954 --> 20:06.831
assuming we make it all four years.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.041
And yet you're willing to disregard

20:09.125 --> 20:10.793
our right to safe spaces?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.503
What are you talking about?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.380
The Hancocks!

20:14.463 --> 20:17.967
So, because I call it out,
racism is my fault?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.719
Think about that night with Reggie.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.053
Everyone at that party--

20:21.137 --> 20:22.471
hell, this whole campus--

20:22.555 --> 20:25.015
has been on edge because of you.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.227
[Lionel] The namesake of this very hall.

20:28.310 --> 20:32.064
I wonder if anyone here knows
just how much power this administration

20:32.148 --> 20:34.942
is willing to give them
over a $10 million donation,

20:35.025 --> 20:38.446
especially when this school's endowment
is $14 billion!

20:38.529 --> 20:39.530
With a B!

20:39.613 --> 20:41.699
[mouthing words]

20:41.782 --> 20:44.702
The truth is you like things
to be fucked up

20:44.785 --> 20:46.620
so you have a machine
to rage against, Sharpton.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.624
None of this is a threat to you
because you already have the power, Kurt.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.126
Can't you see that?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.880
Just ask yourself,

20:55.963 --> 20:57.631
has anything that you've done

20:57.715 --> 20:59.133
actually made things better?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.386
Has it?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.350
We could have been allies, Sam.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.186
But you was tripping.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.773
In fact, because of the protest outside,

21:13.856 --> 21:16.942
they're using their money
to blackmail the administration

21:17.026 --> 21:19.487
into integrating Armstrong-Parker.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.739
How the hell did he know that?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.199
That's enough, young man.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.785
Right about... now,

21:25.868 --> 21:27.411
you should all be receiving an alert

21:27.495 --> 21:29.246
from the <i>Winchester Independent </i>website.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.332
There you can read all about this!

21:31.415 --> 21:34.084
-[cell phones chiming]
-[chattering]

21:42.802 --> 21:43.677
[shudders]

21:48.098 --> 21:48.933
It's crazy.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.435
Everyone decided to piggyback
off my protest,

21:51.519 --> 21:55.105
because God forbid black people
say anything without--

21:55.856 --> 21:58.025
Oh, forget it.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.778
I'm so glad you're here.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.866
I couldn't let Reggie down.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.085
And they put their name
on our new student center?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.461
I set 'em, you spike 'em.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.756
Seeing what you did to your son,
I imagine it involves brainwashing.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.593
He invited me to some big donor thing
because he wants me to get more involved.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.928
And less like a puppet.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.807
Look, nigga, you're gonna hit
these ivy-lined streets,

22:29.890 --> 22:33.060
<i>and you're gonna leave</i>
<i>neither hand unshaken</i>

22:33.143 --> 22:34.645
or baby unkissed.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.230
Yes, sir.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.526
-[man] What the fuck?
-[shouting]

22:51.203 --> 22:53.372
What part of "the Hancocks are off-limits"
possessed you

22:53.455 --> 22:54.999
to post a story
about the motherfucking Hancocks?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.125
Silvio, can you shut up?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.335
Do you even know
how much shit I'm gonna be in?

22:58.961 --> 22:59.795
What'd you say?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.840
I said, can you shut the fuck up?

23:02.923 --> 23:06.093
[overlapping shouting]

23:06.176 --> 23:08.178
[lock rattling]

23:17.897 --> 23:20.900
It's like nothing
about our relationship has been easy.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.402
Who said it was supposed to be easy?

23:23.485 --> 23:24.445
No one.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.990
I just know
it doesn't have to be this hard.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.750
-Listen, I just--
-No, you listen.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.209
This is important to me.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.878
And if you want me on the <i>Independent,</i>

23:40.961 --> 23:43.005
these are the types
of stories I'm gonna write.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.215
And if you don't like it,
then you can just go fuck--

23:51.972 --> 23:54.141
The more I think about it...

23:56.393 --> 23:57.853
the more I know that...

23:59.772 --> 24:01.523
this won't work.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.452
[overlapping shouting]

24:13.535 --> 24:15.204
Everyone, calm the fuck down!

24:15.287 --> 24:18.832
[overlapping shouting]

24:22.169 --> 24:24.088
[all gasp]

24:24.171 --> 24:25.798
Oh, my God.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.681
Hands behind your back.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.353
Let's go.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.815
[Troy] Get off!

24:44.191 --> 24:45.317
Off of me!

24:48.278 --> 24:49.697
Get your hands off me!

24:49.780 --> 24:51.657
[man] Don't resist!

24:51.740 --> 24:54.618
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

24:54.702 --> 24:57.496
-That's my son!
-Dad, I'm cool.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.915
I'm cool.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.716
[man] Clear a path. Go.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.259
-[Troy] It's okay.
-[man] Clear a way.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.468
-[Troy] Everyone, it's okay.
-[man] Move.

25:11.552 --> 25:12.720
[Troy] I'm fine.

25:12.803 --> 25:13.929
[man] Move back, people.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.139
[chattering]

25:15.222 --> 25:16.598
[Troy] Everything's fine.
