WEBVTT

00:02.458 --> 00:04.875
Betrayed...
by my own daughter.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.250
It's a free country.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.333
You know I forbade anyone
in this family

00:08.417 --> 00:10.417
from ever eating
at O'Shanahan's again,

00:10.500 --> 00:12.667
ever since they cut me off
in the middle of

00:12.750 --> 00:14.792
"All You Can Eat Wings"
night.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.083
It was for
your own safety.

00:16.166 --> 00:17.750
You vomited twice
and were having

00:17.834 --> 00:20.417
severe heart palpitations.
I didn't feel full!

00:20.500 --> 00:22.959
The point is, you broke
a promise to your family.

00:23.041 --> 00:25.166
Family always comes
first, Haley.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.458
I need something
to soothe my jangled nerves.

00:28.542 --> 00:30.583
Steve, how about you put a smile
on your old man's face

00:30.667 --> 00:31.917
and do
the "Backseat Shuffle"?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.875
Aw, come on.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.250
Get yourself
out of that seat belt

00:35.333 --> 00:36.667
so you can really give
those shoulders

00:36.750 --> 00:38.959
room to shimmy.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.667
There we go.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.709

00:43.792 --> 00:45.375

00:57.625 --> 00:59.792
How could we have let
this happen?!

00:59.875 --> 01:01.792
What's the big deal?
It's just some dumb old mural.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.166
Wha...
Whoa.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.166
I-I feel a little --
I feel a little woozy.

01:05.250 --> 01:08.083
This mural has been
a Langley Falls institution

01:08.166 --> 01:09.500
since 1982...

01:09.583 --> 01:11.250
I'm just gonna...
rest my head

01:11.291 --> 01:13.333
on this bit of filth here
on the concrete.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.875
...depicting a pantheon
of great Americans --

01:15.959 --> 01:20.250
Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan,
Jesus, Nolan Ryan,

01:20.333 --> 01:21.875
Schneider from
"One Day at a Time,"

01:21.959 --> 01:25.875
in celebration of loyalty,
integrity, and honesty --

01:25.959 --> 01:29.250
three virtues that can be
summed up in one simple word,

01:29.333 --> 01:30.959
"loyntegresty."

01:31.041 --> 01:33.834
A trait you clearly
don't have.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.625
That's it --
At this very moment,

01:35.709 --> 01:38.333
one thing and one thing only
matters --

01:38.417 --> 01:41.417
this mural must
be restored.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.333
Don't you need to sign up
to speak

02:15.417 --> 02:16.959
at the Town Council meeting?
Me?

02:17.041 --> 02:20.041
No, I'm very well-known
in this community.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.917
Hey, it's that guy who pooped
his pants at O'Shanahan's!

02:24.333 --> 02:26.041
Fellow citizens,

02:26.125 --> 02:28.834
have any of you driven down
Old Chickasaw Road recently --

02:28.917 --> 02:30.166
probably not.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.166
Ever since they shut down
that White Castle

02:32.250 --> 02:34.166
where all those Jehovah's
Witnesses got murdered,

02:34.250 --> 02:35.959
there hasn't been
much reason to.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.458
But if you had,
you would've seen...

02:38.542 --> 02:40.208
this!

02:40.291 --> 02:43.583
Our town's most cherished
landmark sullied,

02:43.667 --> 02:45.458
violated, raped.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.709
Okay, okay, too far.
Maybe -- Maybe not raped.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.291
But definitely molested.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.709
That mural is
our greatest treasure,

02:51.792 --> 02:54.375
a clarion call
in brush and hue

02:54.458 --> 02:57.333
to aspire
to our better selves.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.875
It's where I got
my first handy J!

02:59.959 --> 03:02.542
Our love of the mural has
been reignited!

03:04.875 --> 03:08.125
But loving the mural
is not enough.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.709
Unless it's restored,
future generations

03:10.792 --> 03:13.083
will be denied its message
of loyntegresty

03:13.166 --> 03:16.458
and go astray --
like my very own daughter.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.500
This is why you brought me here?

03:19.583 --> 03:21.375
Look, if we're gonna
restore the mural,

03:21.458 --> 03:22.959
maybe we could add
some diversity,

03:23.041 --> 03:25.959
like, say, replace Schneider
with Harriet Tubman?

03:26.041 --> 03:28.166
Did Harriet Tubman
sign autographs

03:28.250 --> 03:30.458
for 15 minutes
at Panini Barn?

03:30.542 --> 03:31.750
This...

03:31.834 --> 03:33.834
this is why I'm proposing
the creation

03:33.917 --> 03:35.875
of a mural-restoration
task force,

03:35.959 --> 03:38.667
a team of our city's
finest artists and craftsmen,

03:38.750 --> 03:40.917
to be led by...me,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.917
the man who crapped himself
at O'Shanahan's.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.542
Did you ever think
you'd have a son who'd be

03:53.625 --> 03:55.458
going to one
of the most exclusive

03:55.542 --> 03:59.208
nonsegregated clowning academies
on the Atlantic seaboard?

03:59.291 --> 04:01.500
No. No, I did not.

04:01.583 --> 04:02.792
Mwah!

04:10.291 --> 04:12.959
The teacher here is
supposed to be the most intense

04:13.041 --> 04:15.417
and demanding instructor
in all of clowning and --

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000
Shit. It's Roger, isn't it?
It's gonna be Roger.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.792
All right, jagoffs,
the name's H.G. Rimmons.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.875
Look to your left.
Look to your right.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.291
By the end of the semester,

04:24.375 --> 04:26.917
60% of you will be dead
by your own hand.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.291
The rest will be clowns,
ya dig?

04:29.375 --> 04:31.083
Okay, I'm out of here.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.250
Huh.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.709
I'm --
I'm a little confused.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.291
Because you said here
on your application

04:36.375 --> 04:37.625
you wanted to be
a clown.

04:37.709 --> 04:38.875
More than anything.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.250
So what's your "gooch"?

04:40.291 --> 04:41.917
Gooch is "horncorn"
for clown name.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.083
Horncorn is horncorn
for clown lingo.

04:44.166 --> 04:47.083
Gonna be honkin' a lot of
horncorn around here, ya dig?

04:47.166 --> 04:48.500
So, what's your gooch,
kid?

04:48.583 --> 04:50.333
Dimples.
Dimples?

04:50.417 --> 04:52.208
Pretty "buckety" gooch,
don't ya think?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.792
More horncorn.
Relax.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.125
Just sliding your whistle.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.041
Why don't you show us
what you got.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.792
I...uh...

04:57.875 --> 04:59.583
Come on, man --
No pressure.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.792
Just lay a little jape
on these cats.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.458
Whatever you got.
No big.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.583
Fart was a nice touch.
Smells, too.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
we could be looking

05:15.375 --> 05:17.917
at the next
Emmett Kelly...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.041
...of sucking!
Ohh.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.125
That's right,
you nut-lickin' little turds.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.375
I ain't here
to hold your hands.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.875
I'm here to play
mind games

05:24.959 --> 05:27.875
and emotionally abuse you
into being clowns.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.083
Ohh.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.583
That's clowning,
you shitheads!

05:34.125 --> 05:35.333
Hey, Dad.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.125
Where's the rest
of the task force?

05:37.208 --> 05:39.208
We had our team-building dinner
at Benihana's.

05:39.291 --> 05:41.208
Blew the whole budget.
Had to let them go.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.166
You know, got to admit,
it's pretty cool

05:43.250 --> 05:44.875
you're doing something
for the community.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.542
This town owes you
one, Stan!

05:48.625 --> 05:49.792
Yeah!

05:52.333 --> 05:55.000
Well, I guess I'll let you
get to it.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.709
Good luck, Dad.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.500
All right, let's start
by getting the grime

06:01.583 --> 06:03.083
off the old cheeks.

06:03.166 --> 06:06.208
Dad, dab, dab. Oh, nope.
Smudging just a little bit.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.542
No problem. No problem.
Just need to even it out.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.250
Easy. Easy.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.166
Okay, now that's really
starting to smear.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.750
Well, I can just freehand
that jawline back into shape.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.875
Hmm. Might as well really get
in there with some 409,

06:19.917 --> 06:21.542
then, and...

06:23.458 --> 06:24.750
There goes the face.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.041
That's okay. That's okay.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.792
Got to get worse
before it gets better.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.125
Let's get the old Brillo Pad
in on the action.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.875
Okay.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.583
Think we're getting back
on track now.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.083
Dad, you look nervous.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.000
Did everything turn out okay
with the mural?

06:45.083 --> 06:46.500
What? Yeah.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.083
I-I mean, yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.000
I think -- I mean, sure.
Yeah, turned out great. Why?

06:51.083 --> 06:52.000
I mean, definitely.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.291
Without any further ado,

06:54.375 --> 06:59.417
I give you
your fully-restored mural!

07:10.542 --> 07:13.333
How could you have done
this, Stan?!

07:16.959 --> 07:19.041
But Stan loved
that mural.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.542
It was his daughter
who had it out

07:21.625 --> 07:23.750
for Schneider.
What?!

07:23.834 --> 07:26.375
Stan did say she lacked
loyntegresty.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.125
I bet she did this --
for hippie reasons!

07:29.208 --> 07:30.417
Yeah!

07:30.500 --> 07:31.917
Dad!

07:32.000 --> 07:34.166
Stand up for me!
Tell them I didn't do it!

07:38.709 --> 07:40.208
Dad!

07:46.792 --> 07:48.583
Haley?

07:48.667 --> 07:50.291
Sugar blossom?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.542
Pumpkin dumpling?

07:52.625 --> 07:55.500
Daddy's little sugar-frosted
raspberry maple fritter?
Leave me alone!

07:55.583 --> 07:57.709
The whole town hates me
because you lied

07:57.792 --> 08:00.458
to cover up
for your own stupid mistake!

08:00.542 --> 08:02.375
That's true.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.875
And I know what it'll take
to make things right.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.583
Ice cream!

08:09.000 --> 08:10.625
Ow!

08:10.709 --> 08:12.250
I want to fight ya!

08:12.333 --> 08:14.083
Come on! Fight me!

08:14.166 --> 08:15.792
Fight me!!

08:15.875 --> 08:17.041
I didn't do it.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.750
Dad, tell them the truth.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.166
The truth?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.291
This is the best damn ice cream
in the tri-county area!

08:25.792 --> 08:28.583
I can hold the hero up
all by myself!

08:30.083 --> 08:32.667
I'm country strong!

08:43.542 --> 08:45.125
Well, kid...

08:45.208 --> 08:47.208
you suck...
Mm.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.500
...ceded
beautifully...

08:49.583 --> 08:51.625
Mm?
...at being God awful...

08:51.709 --> 08:55.083
Mm.
...is the opposite
of what I think.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.750
Mm?
Psych! You stink,
and I hate you.

08:57.834 --> 08:59.959
Now, get this through
your skull, man,

09:00.041 --> 09:01.417
'cause I don't play
mind games.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.125
You will never
be a clown.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.875
You got potential, kid,
and you can't teach that.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.000
You know what?

09:08.083 --> 09:09.583
I host a little retreat
every summer

09:09.667 --> 09:11.083
at my house on Block Island

09:11.166 --> 09:13.625
for just a handful
of my most promising students.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.041
No real structure.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.583
We just honk
a little buffoonery,

09:16.667 --> 09:18.166
lay some japes,
blow each other --

09:18.250 --> 09:19.583
you know,
clown stuff.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.208
And I think you could
make the cut.
Really?

09:21.291 --> 09:24.500
If you push yourself
to the absolute limit.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.792
Uhp, I got to take this.
It's my "aclowntant."

09:28.875 --> 09:30.375
You know,
a clown accountant?

09:30.458 --> 09:31.959
He's got this giant
calculator

09:32.041 --> 09:33.792
that only ever adds up
to "boobs."

09:33.875 --> 09:35.125
Pretty funny, but, frankly,

09:35.208 --> 09:37.000
I think he's been stealing
from me.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.458
Now, I know
you're still upset.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.750
I can't even show my face
in this town anymore!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.166
Well, I've taken care
of that.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.875
You confessed
to the town that

09:47.959 --> 09:49.250
you were the one
who ruined the mural?

09:49.333 --> 09:52.000
Better -- I've converted
the garage into...

09:52.083 --> 09:54.166
"Haley's Hideaway."

09:54.250 --> 09:55.625
Now you'll never have
to leave the house --

09:55.709 --> 09:56.792
or want to.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.458
Dad, this is
the single worst --

09:58.542 --> 09:59.792
When you're not
racking up high scores

09:59.875 --> 10:01.959
on your sweet "Sopranos"
pinball machine,

10:02.041 --> 10:04.417
you can groove to some hot tunes
on your top-of-the-line

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
Sanyo boom box --
with MegaBass.

10:07.583 --> 10:08.792
You still like Warrant,
right?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.667
I don't recall ever
having --

10:10.750 --> 10:12.875
♪ She's my cherry pie ♪
Dad!

10:12.959 --> 10:14.750

10:14.834 --> 10:16.959
♪ Tastes so good, make... ♪

10:18.834 --> 10:21.125

10:21.208 --> 10:24.000
Oh, yeah!

10:50.291 --> 10:55.792

10:55.875 --> 10:56.834
Aah!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.417
Well, kid, you did it.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.291
You pushed yourself
to the absolute limit.

11:03.375 --> 11:04.875
So, when's the retreat?

11:04.959 --> 11:07.166
Ha! You were never
going on the retreat.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.792
I was just using you
to motivate Gumdrop.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.542
Gumdrop, you really got
my attention

11:11.625 --> 11:12.875
when you made
that banana disappear.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.041
Hello, is this
the North American Federation

11:17.125 --> 11:19.291
of Clowning Academics?

11:19.375 --> 11:22.166
Well, I'd like
to file a report.

11:22.250 --> 11:25.583
An instructor, uh...
well, he...

11:25.667 --> 11:27.667
he hit me!

11:31.750 --> 11:35.375
Haley, honey,
you were right.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.959
It's time I finally
did the one simple thing

11:38.041 --> 11:39.750
I should've done
from the very beginning and --

11:39.834 --> 11:42.667
Ether says what?!

11:42.750 --> 11:44.250
Don't worry,
baby girl.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.959
You'll be able
to show your face again...

11:47.041 --> 11:49.041
once you have a new face.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.834
I've seen Dr. Weitzman
do this tons of times at work.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.750
How hard can it be?
All right.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.166
Let's start by reshaping
the old eyes.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.500
Tap, tap, tap.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.083
Oop, oop.
Eyeball's bulging just a bit.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.375
No problem. No problem.
Just need to even it out.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.000
Easy. Easy.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.542
Okay, that one really came out.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.000
Well, might as well really get
in there

12:22.083 --> 12:23.542
with a scalpel then and...

12:23.625 --> 12:25.500
There goes the face.

12:25.583 --> 12:26.792
That's okay. That's okay.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.792
Got to get worse
before it gets better.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.333
Let's get the old Brillo Pad
in on the action.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.542
Okay!

12:33.625 --> 12:35.583
Think we're getting back
on track now.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.792
You made me a monster!

12:44.875 --> 12:47.000
Oh, it --
it's not that bad.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.500
All you need is...
the right hat.

12:51.166 --> 12:54.792
Is that Eva Marie Saint standing
in my garage?!

12:58.166 --> 13:00.250
How could you
do this to me?!

13:00.291 --> 13:02.792
I-I need to get away
from this town.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.250
I need to get away
from you!

13:05.333 --> 13:06.834
Aaaaaaaah!

13:08.333 --> 13:09.458
Haley!

13:09.542 --> 13:11.333
You shouldn't drive!

13:11.417 --> 13:13.458
You're acting all crazy!

13:13.542 --> 13:14.458
Aah!

13:18.250 --> 13:20.125
Damn it, O'Shanahan's!

13:20.208 --> 13:22.834
I just fixed her face!

13:27.458 --> 13:30.792
I'm afraid Haley is
in what we call a "super coma."

13:30.875 --> 13:34.417
But at least she's not
in any pain, right?

13:34.500 --> 13:35.959
Oh, quite
to the contrary.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.667
The only part of her brain
that's still functioning

13:37.875 --> 13:39.333
are the pain receptors,

13:39.417 --> 13:41.625
leaving her in a perpetual state
of searing agony.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.792
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a doctor poop

13:43.875 --> 13:45.083
in the doctor bathroom.

13:46.583 --> 13:51.792
♪♪

13:55.166 --> 13:56.959
Wassup?!

13:57.041 --> 14:00.959
You may have them fooled,
"doctor," but not me.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.333
Fine.

14:02.417 --> 14:03.709
It's me, Haley.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.917
What?! I thought you were
a nurse

14:07.000 --> 14:08.959
trying to pass yourself off
as a doctor!

14:09.041 --> 14:10.333
How can this be?

14:10.417 --> 14:13.125
When I saw what my dad had
done to my face,

14:13.208 --> 14:14.583
it was the final straw.

14:14.667 --> 14:18.834
I became consumed by one goal
and one goal only --

14:18.917 --> 14:20.375
revenge.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.875
So I pretended to drive off
in hysterics

14:22.959 --> 14:25.041
and faked my accident.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.792
Then it was just a matter
of blackmailing Dr. Weitzman

14:27.875 --> 14:32.709
into actually
reconstructing my face...

14:34.792 --> 14:38.083
...and recruiting Jeff to play
the part of poor comatose Haley.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.875
Now I'll have a front-row seat
to watch my dad suffer,

14:41.959 --> 14:44.792
wracked with guilt
as I describe to him every day

14:44.875 --> 14:48.750
just how much pain
his darling daughter is in.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.583
You will keep my secret,
right, Klaus?

14:50.667 --> 14:54.709
Absolutely. I, too,
desire to see Stan suffer.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.083
You see, just last week,

14:57.166 --> 15:01.125
I asked him if he'd give me
notes on my comic-strip idea.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.125
And you know
what he said to me?

15:04.208 --> 15:06.125
Well, I have to go to work
right now,

15:06.208 --> 15:08.834
but I'd be happy
to take a look later.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.417
Happy to take a look
later?!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.166
Revenge will be ours!

15:19.583 --> 15:23.125
Wh-Where's he going?

15:23.208 --> 15:25.542
He's not feeling guilty
at all.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.000
He's back at work
on that stupid mural!

15:29.083 --> 15:32.417
And he's hired Langley's
most accomplished artist,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.125
the guy who paints the frescos
at Olive Garden.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.500
Looks like the grand unveiling
is this Saturday.

15:38.583 --> 15:42.583
That's the way
to make him suffer.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.291
We'll blow up the mural
at the unveiling.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.000
He'll be devastated.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.792
And revenge will, at last,
be mine!

15:49.875 --> 15:52.709
Wait, Klaus. Where did you
get those binoculars?

15:52.792 --> 15:55.750
Are those Ashlyn's binoculars,
my old American Girl doll?

15:55.834 --> 15:58.166
She can lend her stuff
to whoever she wants!

15:59.792 --> 16:01.875
Dr. Montacristo,
what are you doing here?

16:01.959 --> 16:05.208
Oh, you might say
I have a great personal interest

16:05.291 --> 16:07.750
in the fate
of this mural.
Okay.

16:07.834 --> 16:12.834
The unveiling's sure to be
an explosive event.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.000
Yep.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.458
Hey, hon.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.083
I brought you some chicken soup
for lunch.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.500
Oh. Dr. Montacristo.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.208
Would you like some, too?

16:22.291 --> 16:26.125
Actually, Mrs. Smith,
I prefer gazpacho,

16:26.208 --> 16:31.500
a dish, like revenge,
best served cold.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.542
All right. I'm out.

16:46.917 --> 16:48.959
If everyone would please
have a seat,

16:49.041 --> 16:51.000
we can begin the proceedings.

16:55.250 --> 16:58.125
Aaaaaah!

17:00.583 --> 17:02.333
Okay.

17:02.417 --> 17:03.750
Everybody...

17:03.834 --> 17:04.875
we don't have all day.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.500
Gentlemen!

17:15.583 --> 17:18.000
If you don't stop doing bits,
we'll never get out of here.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.792
Now, Mr. Rimmons,

17:20.875 --> 17:22.250
this isn't the first time

17:22.333 --> 17:24.250
you've been accused
of hitting a student.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.750
But it is the first time
I didn't actually do it.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.417
May I retract
that statement?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.959
You're hereby stripped of
your clown-teaching license.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.417
Looks like you won, kid.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.208
Ahem.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.083
Meeting adjourned.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.166
Fellow citizens,

17:54.250 --> 17:57.375
it's time this whole mural
fiasco was made right.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.458
Okay, on my mark.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.709
Three...

18:00.792 --> 18:02.166
So, at long last...

18:02.250 --> 18:03.333
...two...

18:03.417 --> 18:05.083
...I finally give to you...

18:05.166 --> 18:06.083
...one...

18:06.166 --> 18:07.417
...my confession.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.500
Wait! Abort, abort!

18:10.583 --> 18:13.166
Goofus McDoof sends
his regards!

18:13.291 --> 18:14.834
Aah!

18:14.917 --> 18:18.500
Yes, it was me, not Hayley,
who ruined the mural.

18:18.583 --> 18:21.625
I was so scared of losing my
status as a hero to all of you

18:21.709 --> 18:24.208
that I betrayed my own daughter.

18:24.291 --> 18:27.250
But then I see her in that coma,
and ever since,

18:27.333 --> 18:29.875
my only hope has been
that this monumental confession

18:29.959 --> 18:32.208
might somehow reach
through to her

18:32.291 --> 18:34.333
and bring her back to me.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.125
♪♪

18:41.250 --> 18:43.500
See what your dad did,
honey?

18:43.583 --> 18:45.834
Squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.333
Mrs. Smith,
if you don't mind,

18:47.417 --> 18:49.375
I need to re-catheterize
your daughter's penis.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.834
Sure, sure, whatever.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.000
Oh, Daddy!

18:55.083 --> 18:56.291
Still got it.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.458
No, Dad.
It's me, Hayley.

18:58.542 --> 19:01.041
Hayley? Baby girl!
You're all right!

19:01.125 --> 19:03.542
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Can you ever forgive me?

19:03.625 --> 19:05.959
Hey, what you did
up there...

19:06.041 --> 19:08.166
showed a lot
of loyntegresty.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.166
So I don't think
people need to see

19:10.250 --> 19:12.041
a monument
to your eternal shame

19:12.125 --> 19:14.542
every time they drive down
Old Chickasaw Road.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.083
Why?

19:22.166 --> 19:25.417
Why would anyone want
to destroy my AutoZone?

19:30.125 --> 19:32.834
So, you think you'll end up
getting your old face back?

19:32.875 --> 19:36.000
I dunno. Probably.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.041
And, remember,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:41.125 --> 19:44.375
Belljar papers are due Friday --
no exceptions.

19:44.458 --> 19:45.750
Jenna, that means you.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.500
Hey, babe, should be home
in about 10 minutes.

19:51.792 --> 19:54.250
You know what?
Make it 20.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.291
I got to say hi to...
an old friend.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.208
Aah!

20:09.291 --> 20:10.625
(raspy] That's right.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.125
I've returned...
as an It-style evil clown

20:14.208 --> 20:17.125
named "Gladhandz,"
thirsting for revenge.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.500
That's Gladhandz with a "Z."

20:18.583 --> 20:20.208
I'll haunt
your every dream

20:20.291 --> 20:23.333
until, finally, I lure you
into the depths of the sewer

20:23.417 --> 20:25.166
and to your doom.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.166
Uh-huh, and how are you
gonna do that, then?

20:27.250 --> 20:28.542
Um...

20:28.625 --> 20:31.041
Get in the sewer!

20:31.125 --> 20:33.792
I-I'll level with you, Steve.
I didn't think this through.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.625
I caught wind on LinkedIn

20:35.709 --> 20:37.291
of how well you were
doing out here,

20:37.375 --> 20:38.959
and I-I guess
I just kind of lost it.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.291
Next thing you know, I'm filing
my teeth down to points

20:41.375 --> 20:43.000
and climbing
into a sewer drain.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.125
I'll be straight with you,
Steve.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.375
I need your help --

20:45.458 --> 20:47.333
both financially and just,
you know,

20:47.417 --> 20:48.917
to get out of the sewer.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.959
How long ago
did he walk away?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.917
Oh, quite a while ago.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Then you shall inherit
the curse of Gladhandz!

20:58.375 --> 21:01.083
You'll never
be free of me!
