Hey, Earl,
did you ever worry...

00:03.937 --> 00:05.806
that you're gonna
forget how to walk?

00:05.873 --> 00:07.841
No, I can't say that I do.

00:07.908 --> 00:11.179
'Cause when we were eatin'
in there, I started to worry
that when we got up,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.347
my legs wouldn't
know what to do.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.716
They seem to be doin'
all right.
Yeah, for now.

00:15.783 --> 00:19.253

it's like startin'
all over again.

- We can't go that way.

I think we're stuck.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.803
Randy, I'm not gonna
stand here forever just
'cause you're superstitious.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.473
Why? Every day of my life
revolves around you

Plus, we always buy
the kind of cereal you like.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.213
How long do we have to wait?

Three hours, or until
a white cat circles us
backwards.

[ Earl Narrating ]
I know we must've looked pretty
crazy sittin' on that sidewalk,

01:02.596 --> 01:05.166
but Randy insisted
we had to wait three hours...

01:05.233 --> 01:07.601
before it was safe to cross
a black cat's path.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.003
Damned thing circled us.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.606
That's it. It's 3:15.

[ Earl Narrating ]
A black cat crosses your path
once, it's bad luck.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.987
It crosses your path twice,
it's really bad luck.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.691
But three times?
Well, that's when karma's
trying to tell you somethin'.

01:30.758 --> 01:35.296
And it was tellin' me
to fix number 56--
larceny of a kitty cat.

01:35.363 --> 01:38.799
[ Cats Meowing ]
Every year,
Camden had a cat show...

01:38.866 --> 01:43.437
which people who love cats
and had a lot of time on
their hands took real seriously.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.473
And like with every
competitive sportin' event--
[ Growling ]

01:45.539 --> 01:47.675

01:47.741 --> 01:50.711
- Randy. Randy, that's him.
That's him.
- Where? I can't see anything.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.781
These cats are makin'
my eyes watery
and my tongue all itchy.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.017

And you think of somethin'
you like, like tuna
or a really slow mouse.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.595
[ Earl Narrating ]
So who would want me to harm
such a beautiful animal...

02:07.661 --> 02:10.931
just so they had
a better chance of winnin'
the first-place cash?

02:10.998 --> 02:15.603

You wanna know if her heinie

[ Earl Narrating ]
Being a big Tonya Harding fan,

02:17.938 --> 02:21.409
Joy wanted me to Nancy Kerrigan
the cat so it couldn't compete.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.577
But I was havin' trouble
gettin' it done.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.847
I don't even know where
a damn cat knee is.
My hands are burnin'.

02:26.914 --> 02:30.184
Ooh, it's droolin' and hummin'
that weird "I like you" sound
even though I hate it.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.752
[ Earl Narrating ]
I wanted to help Joy,

02:31.819 --> 02:33.921
but Sebastian's eyes
must've been prettier
than Nancy Kerrigan's,

02:33.987 --> 02:35.889
'cause I just couldn't do it.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.593
So I sneaked him into a place
where he'd be welcome...

02:39.660 --> 02:43.063
and could pee
wherever he wanted to:
The sleepy cat lady's house.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.132
[ Cats Meowing ]

02:45.199 --> 02:49.837
With Sebastian out of the
picture, Joy thought her cat
might actually have a chance.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.307
Healthy teeth.
Nice coat.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.277
Ma'am, is your cat
wearing lipstick?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.878
Mm-hmm, Lip Smackers--
same as mine.

02:57.945 --> 03:01.014
And are these
colored contact lenses?
Yeah.

03:01.081 --> 03:05.152
It was not easy gettin' 'em
in there. He's been jumpy ever
since I waxed his eyebrows.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.121

a code "C" over here.

Am I a winner?

[ Earl Narrating ]
Not only did Joy's cat not win,

03:12.293 --> 03:15.263
- it got rescued and put
into kitty foster care.
- Hold on!

03:15.329 --> 03:19.066
I gotta give those contacts
back to my neighbor Lateesha
before she goes on date night!

03:19.132 --> 03:22.903
[ Earl Narrating ] Since karma
wanted me to get Sebastian back
to the girl I stole him from,

03:22.970 --> 03:25.839
well, I went back to
the sleeping cat lady's house.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.343
Everything was exactly
how it was before,
except for the smell.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.712
It was three years worse.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.683
Unfortunately,
to a guy like me,
all cats look the same,

03:35.749 --> 03:38.252
and I couldn't tell
which one was Sebastian.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.288
[ Meowing ]

03:40.354 --> 03:43.924
To be honest, I was kind of
hopin' after all these years
of not havin' her cat,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.627
Judy would've moved on.

03:46.694 --> 03:50.831
But she hadn't.
How could you do that
to such an innocent creature?

03:50.898 --> 03:54.902
It was his idea.
I asked the same thing...
in my mind.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.338
At least this means
he's not lost.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.840
We know where to find him.
That's good, right?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.610
Yeah, I guess. You know,
I'm tryin' not to hate you
right now,

04:02.676 --> 04:06.013
because hate is not
what Sebastian is about.

a big tickle out of this when

04:18.359 --> 04:21.128
but before I could even
think about that,

04:21.194 --> 04:25.933

for one more trip into

Not much'll get Randy
into a house full of cats.

I knew he had a crush on Judy.

04:41.515 --> 04:45.453
[ Earl Narrating ] Even though
he had let himself go, Judy
could still pick out Sebastian,

04:45.519 --> 04:48.055
which was a lot easier
than pickin' him up.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.625

an extra few pounds.

There's only two things that
Randy does that scare me.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.010
One is the way
he stops breathin'
when he's sleepin'.

05:10.077 --> 05:14.515
The other is when he pretends
to be someone he isn't
because he likes a girl.

05:14.582 --> 05:18.786
There was the artsy chick
he dated who smoked cloves
and ate bone marrow.

There was the girl whose parents
were Hasidic Jews.

of the Camden County
Black Power movement.

until he stopped pretendin'
to be somebody else...

05:31.432 --> 05:33.401

I like it okay, I guess.
But I think...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.938
when people talk
about their dreams,
it's kind of boring.

have aliens in it?
