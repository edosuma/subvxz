In the criminal justice system,

00:02.636 --> 00:06.540
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.277
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.310 --> 00:10.811
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.844 --> 00:12.613
are members of an elite squad

00:12.646 --> 00:14.215
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.084
These are their stories.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.091

00:23.124 --> 00:24.358
(boy)
You're so beautiful.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.294
(girl)
I love you.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.729
(woman)
If I get a call from
your school one more ti--

00:28.762 --> 00:30.264
Oh, my God!

00:30.298 --> 00:31.732
What are you doing?!

00:31.765 --> 00:34.402
Mom...
I told you to stay
away from my daughter, okay?

00:34.435 --> 00:35.403
Don't touch her!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.305
Calm down,
Mrs. Eldridge.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.372
What did he do to you?

00:38.406 --> 00:39.673
He didn't do anything
to me.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.375
We'll see what the police
have to say about this.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.177
I'm outta here.
No.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.545
No, you're not.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.813
Hey, what are you doing?

00:45.846 --> 00:48.082
Come on!

00:48.116 --> 00:49.717
Kid's name is
Carrie Eldridge.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.719
She locked the door
to her room.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.521
She's crying.
Says he's her boyfriend.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.156
Mom calls it in
as a rape.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.557
You guys couldn't
sort this out?

00:56.590 --> 01:00.128
We hear the "R" word,
we're supposed to call you.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.595
Why don't you just
kick the door down?

01:01.629 --> 01:04.132
(Officer)
Ma'am, these detectives are
from the Special Victims Unit.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.167
(Stabler)
Detective Stabler.
My partner, Detective Benson.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.067
Can you tell us
what happened?

01:07.101 --> 01:09.537
I caught that man
raping my daughter.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.172
(Benson)
Did she tell you
that she was raped?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.573
No.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.841
Ma'am, we can't arrest
your daughter's boyfriend

01:13.874 --> 01:16.644
for having sex with her
if she consented.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.113
He's 21.
She's 15.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.314
That's statutory rape.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.650
I know the law.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.152
Boyfriend still in there?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.219
I took his clothes

01:25.253 --> 01:27.388
so he couldn't leave.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.490
Okay, Officer Harris here

01:29.523 --> 01:31.125
will take you down
to the squad now.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.793
I wanna be here
when Carrie comes out.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.762
We need
your statement.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.398
You bring her down as soon
as Carrie opens that door.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.234
We will.
[knocking softly]

01:40.268 --> 01:43.437
Carrie, my name is Olivia.
I'm a detective.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.373
(Carrie)
My mom is wrong
about Justin.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.575
(Benson)
Your mom went down
to the police station.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.346
(Carrie)
I don't know what she's making
such a big deal about.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.782
Justin and I
were only kissing.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.250
He went out
the window?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.418
He must be freezing.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.188
The ladder to the street
isn't pulled down.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.722
He must've gone
to the roof.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.259
Keep your eyes open
in case he comes back.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.638
Doors were locked.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.673
Stand up.
Am I under arrest?

02:19.707 --> 02:21.375
You 21?

02:21.409 --> 02:23.544
Yeah.
Let's go.

02:23.577 --> 02:27.215
[shivering]

03:22.403 --> 03:23.237
[door opens]

03:23.271 --> 03:24.972
Is Justin okay?
He's Fine.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.241
[door closes]

03:27.275 --> 03:29.943
Did he force you, Carrie?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.246
Force me to do what?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.382
Kiss him?

03:34.415 --> 03:35.583
To have sex with him.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.518
He doesn't force me
to do anything.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.520
And we didn't have sex.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.389
I swear we didn't do it.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.523
Carrie's mom says you did.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.294
She didn't see anything.
We were under the covers, man.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.528
Naked.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.765
Is Carrie in the next room?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.601
Yeah.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.404
[pounds wall]
Carrie?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.539
(Justin)
Are you in there?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.342
Justin!
Justin, is that you?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.943
I love you, Justin.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.612
Do what we said.

04:04.645 --> 04:08.449
I love you too!
[pounds wall]

04:08.482 --> 04:10.050
You see?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.886
She sound like I raped her?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.988
Look...

04:15.022 --> 04:17.658
she's hot.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.694
I used to be your age.
I know what it's like.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.395
You're wrong.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.463
(Denise)
Carrie's just a child.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.466
And he's got her wrapped
around his little finger.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.536
First love, teenagers
can fall hard.

04:28.569 --> 04:32.039
I just don't know
what she sees in him.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.807
Her father feel
the same way?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.676
Last time I saw
her father

04:35.709 --> 04:38.846
was the day I told him
I was pregnant.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.081
I'm not gonna let that happen
to Carrie.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.318
The only thing Justin wants
her for is sex.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.853
He loves me.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.921
That doesn't make it okay
for you to have sex with him.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.390
Because I'm 15?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.058
My birthday's in two months.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.526
And when you're 17,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.362
it's not gonna matter
what I think

04:54.395 --> 04:55.496
or what your mother thinks.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.498
My mother thinks
Justin's a loser.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.767
She's trying to protect you.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.469
She doesn't listen to me.
Talks back to me.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.771
That's when she's
talking to me at all.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
Have you ever thought
about getting counseling?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.841
Carrie refuses to go.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.911
She got crazy mad
when I even suggested it.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.846
The way she rewrites
history and--

05:12.880 --> 05:15.315
The shrink would even
kick us out after ten minutes.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.754
I hear these kids at school
talking about a boy

05:20.788 --> 05:22.590
who divorced his dad.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.058
Can a kid really do that?

05:26.927 --> 05:29.062
If you're living
on your own,

05:29.096 --> 05:31.532
the courts can consider
you emancipated.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.902
The only other way is
if your mother gives up

05:34.935 --> 05:36.970
her parental rights.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.873
She's never gonna do that.
Especially now.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.576
Carrie.

05:42.610 --> 05:46.480
Sometimes people your age
get so mad at their parents

05:46.514 --> 05:50.017
that they look for somebody
who they think can rescue them.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.885
That's not what I'm doing.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.423
I really love Justin.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.957
Those two are like magnets.
Romeo and Juliet.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.493
Yeah, except Juliet's
too young and Romeo's too old.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.961
Any chance we can get
Romeo's parents

06:00.994 --> 06:01.929
to put some pressure
on him?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
No, they died in a car accident
two years ago.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.599
Wouldn't matter.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.668
Neither one of 'em is ever
gonna admit they did anything.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.802
Well, unless Mom was
in bed with them

06:08.836 --> 06:11.038
and saw what they were doing,
there's no rape case.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.574
(Denise)
Carrie?
Carrie, did you tell them?

06:13.607 --> 06:14.575
(Carrie)
Why are you shouting?

06:14.608 --> 06:15.876
He'll ruin you!

06:15.909 --> 06:18.646
Just like your
so-called father did to me.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.481
Mom, don't do this here.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.949
Come on.
We'll go outside.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.717
Don't tell me what to do!

06:23.751 --> 06:25.653
You stop seeing him!

06:25.686 --> 06:27.054
Mom, I'm never going
to stop seeing him.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.456
You ungrateful little slut.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.857
I gave up everything
for you.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.626
Take it easy,
Mrs. Eldridge.
Keep your hands off of me!

06:32.660 --> 06:34.895
Justin Sharp raped
my daughter.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.497
Now what are you
gonna do about it?

06:36.530 --> 06:37.631
We can't arrest him
for statutory rape

06:37.665 --> 06:40.434
unless we can prove that sexual
intercourse took place.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.436
(Stabler)
We'd need a statement from
Carrie or medical evidence.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.572
Medical evidence.
How do I get that?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.107
Usually, we take the victim
to the hospital

06:47.140 --> 06:48.476
for an examination.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.978
Fine.
Let's go.
Do I have to?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.680
Mrs. Eldridge,

06:52.713 --> 06:53.881
you can't make
Carrie do this.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.882
I'm her mother.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.949
Watch me.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.719
Fine.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.589
Where are you going?

07:01.622 --> 07:02.656
With you.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.857
If the E.R. does a rape kit,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.894
I have to take it
to the crime lab.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.231
(Carrie)
I don't even know
what a rape kit is.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.166
It's a gynecological
exam.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.168
I'll take swabs
to check for semen.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.237
If the DNA matches Justin's,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.773
then we're gonna
arrest him for rape.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.775
Believe me,
it'll match.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.911
I said we didn't have sex.
Doesn't that matter?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.145
We don't need your statement

07:25.178 --> 07:27.715
if we find Justin's
DNA inside you.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.782
Stop wasting
the doctor's time,

07:28.816 --> 07:30.951
and put on the gown.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.221
Carrie Eldridge?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.923
This is a treatment room.
Who are you?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.224
I'm Simone Bryce.
I'm Carrie's attorney.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.559
[curtain slides]

07:38.592 --> 07:40.027
Carrie's what?
Her attorney.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.062
Carrie doesn't need
an attorney.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.665
I'm a lawyer for kids,
and I heard that you need help.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.166
Heard from who?

07:46.199 --> 07:49.169
That's confidential.
What's going on here, Detective?

07:49.202 --> 07:52.172
Carrie's mother
wants her to have a rape kit.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.575
Is that what you want?

07:54.608 --> 07:55.943
No way.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.745
Okay, we're not going to be
needing your services.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.947
Thank you very much,
Doctor.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.482
Wait a minute.
Doctor?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.255
I want Carrie examined!

08:08.288 --> 08:10.958
Mrs. Eldridge.
Shut up!

08:10.991 --> 08:13.026
Look, this has
nothing to do with you.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.095
I'm a parent.
I have rights too.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.998
Not when it comes to Carrie's
privacy and sexual matters.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.100
I don't care what she says.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.135
We're not leaving here
until you've been checked out.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.137
It's her body,
and she's made her decision.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.006
Why don't you take your daughter
home, Mrs. Eldridge?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.609
(Benson)
We're done here.
My daughter's been violated.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.877
Whose side are you on?

08:29.910 --> 08:33.013
Hers.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.886
Carrie agree
to the rape kit?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.053
Nope.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.254
Where's Justin?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.090
I sent him home.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.293
He's not gonna run.
We can call him at any time.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.762
For what?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.898
Endangering the welfare
of a child.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.333
What good is
that gonna do?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.635
Look, it was
statutory rape.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.903
Yeah, I know the law.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.237
I'm just trying to figure out
the best way

08:57.270 --> 08:58.271
through this for Carrie.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
Okay, she's 15.
Justin is 21.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.643
He's breaking the law
by having sex with her.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.011
Elliot,
the mother is using us

09:04.044 --> 09:05.779
just like she tried
to use a doctor

09:05.813 --> 09:08.015
to strap her down on the table
and force her legs open.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
Would you do that
to one of your daughters?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.885
My daughters have
nothing to do with this.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.654
You really want to
traumatize Carrie?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.055
Let her mom drag
her through the courts

09:15.088 --> 09:16.156
and bully her some more.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.126
(Cragen)
Olivia?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.794
My office.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.902
Why is Denise Eldridge
screaming to One P-P

09:28.936 --> 09:30.871
that you talked her daughter
out of a rape kit?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.172
Carrie didn't want it.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.707
Now that's exactly
what Simone Bryce

09:33.741 --> 09:35.075
told Carrie's mother.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.711
That's funny how
a children's rights attorney

09:37.745 --> 09:39.613
just happened to show up
at the E.R.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.014
She was there
because I called her.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.050
You've got enough
on your plate

09:43.083 --> 09:44.785
without taking on this kid
as a cause.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.153
Well, somebody's
gotta protect her

09:46.186 --> 09:47.688
from that lunatic
mother of hers.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.056
Why are you
calling her that?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.391
You saw how she
humiliated Carrie

09:51.424 --> 09:52.926
in front of the entire squad.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.994
I don't like her.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.195
Well, she has a right
to be upset.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.363
She's upset because
she thinks

09:56.396 --> 09:58.632
Carrie is gonna end up
just like her.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.933
Pregnant without a man.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.902
Denise Eldridge believes
a crime was committed

10:01.935 --> 10:03.270
against her daughter.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.873
Denise Eldridge
is a fruitcake.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.040
(Stabler)
Well, uh--

10:07.074 --> 10:09.843
dessert is served.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.846
What now?

10:12.880 --> 10:15.816
You stay here.
We'll handle this.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.019
Mrs. Eldridge,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.220
how can we help you?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.089
I have the evidence
that Carrie was raped.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.957
Is that a comforter?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.059
From her bed.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.128
That one has the bedsheets
and the pillowcases.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.130
You can get all the DNA
you need off them.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.865
And in this one,

10:31.899 --> 10:33.433
these are a bunch of emails
that Carrie and Justin

10:33.466 --> 10:36.303
sent back and forth
to each other.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.905
(Stabler)
Did you read these emails?

10:37.938 --> 10:38.972
Of course I did.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.741
Do Carrie and Justin admit
to having intercourse

10:40.774 --> 10:41.942
in any of them?

10:41.975 --> 10:45.145
No, but they're proof
of a relationship.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.015
We can't make a case for rape
with Carrie's bedding.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.251
But they probably have
Justin's fluids all over them.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.789
Unless the fluids
are on or in Carrie,

10:55.823 --> 10:58.358
we can't charge rape.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.228
What can you charge?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
Endangering the welfare
of a minor.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.198
Well, then why haven't you
arrested Justin for that?

11:05.232 --> 11:06.767
It's a weak case.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.468
And the D.A.'s office might
decline to prosecute.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.037
Oh.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.805
Well, then I guess
I'll have to talk to them.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.942
Won't I?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.277
So what, you guys couldn't deal
with Denise Eldridge

11:17.310 --> 11:18.411
so you sicced her on me?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.080
What happened?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.882
Oh, she blew in here
with her shopping bag

11:21.915 --> 11:24.151
saying you guys weren't doing
anything about her daughter.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.418
She wanted me
to charge you guys

11:25.452 --> 11:26.820
for not arresting
Justin Sharp.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.221
(Stabler)
So what do you want us to do?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.190
Did he rape Carrie?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.159
Letter of the law, yeah.
But we can't prove it.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.026
The sex was consensual.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.728
You charge Justin
with endangering,

11:34.762 --> 11:36.229
it's a misdemeanor,
first offense.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.865
He's not gonna do any time.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.232
So how is justice
served there?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.001
It's not.
Right.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.236
And when Denise comes back next
week with the same accusation--

11:43.270 --> 11:45.839
Why don't you advise her
that unless she has pictures,

11:45.873 --> 11:48.308
we're not prosecuting Justin.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.046
(Stabler)
She's probably not even home.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.750
Well, I'll leave my card
in her mailbox.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.218
With your name on it,
she'll probably rip it up.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.287
Here, use mine.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.889
You know I'm right.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.223
What, that Denise
is a fruitcake? Yeah.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.025
But she shouldn't try
to protect her daughter?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.126
Well, no.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.360
(man)
Are you the police?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
(Benson)
Yes, sir.
Is there a problem?

12:09.029 --> 12:11.298
I called the precinct
an hour ago

12:11.331 --> 12:13.867
about the ruckus
from the apartment upstairs.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.970
Buzz us in.

12:19.272 --> 12:23.276
Mrs. Eldridge?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.114
Check out the wall.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.217
Carrie?

12:44.464 --> 12:49.402
Romeo and Juliet killed
themselves, not their parents.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.541
(O'Halloran)
Here's your murder weapon.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.376
Found it
in the incinerator room.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.045
It looks like
the attack started here.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.413
That seems right.
See the arc on the wall?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.515
That's castoff
from the subsequent blows.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.151
Tails on the droplets
in the pattern point

13:04.184 --> 13:05.485
to where the blood came from.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.487
That spot right there.
It's got a pattern in it.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.589
Yeah, it's secondary transfer
from the button on her jeans.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.591
The line next to it
is off the seam

13:11.624 --> 13:12.492
down the side of her pants

13:12.525 --> 13:14.494
from when she stopped,
rolled on her side.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.363
Surprised she made it this far.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.865
Her skull is cracked
wide open.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.499
We're still looking
for all the missing pieces.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.934
How many times
was she hit?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.003
I count five blows
to the head alone.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.038
And she's got wounds
on her torso and extremities.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.173
Dead how long?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.008
She's still warm.
Two hours tops.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.510
Carrie's school says she was
in homeroom this morning.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.378
They're looking for her now,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.480
and Justin's not scheduled
to work today.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.183
Man's coat was
on Carrie's bed.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.584
Gotta be Justin's.
He was here.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.853
Call came in to 911
over an hour ago.

13:39.887 --> 13:43.323
Car was stolen two blocks
from here by a guy and a girl.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.558
Detectives.
Volvo wagon.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.927
Central's already
got the tag.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.029
Belongs to a Marissa Tatro
over here.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.130
Says she left
the keys inside.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.264
Mrs. Tatro?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.100
(Stabler)
Can you tell us what happened.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.535
I was bringing my baby inside
when this guy ran up,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.537
pushed the girl into the car
and took off.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.939
Can you describe them?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.207
They were young.
Teenagers.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.509
I think he had
blood all over his shirt.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.211
The girl was screaming.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.545
Well, what was she saying?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.080
Stuff like,
please don't take me.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.882
We have to go back.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.583
Then he said, "We gotta
get out of here."

14:10.617 --> 14:12.419
Can you find them
with that RADAR thing?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.853
Your car has Theft Track?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.655
Whatever it's called.
(Stabler)
We can activate that.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.623
(Officer)
Don't bother.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.992
Anti-crime unit
in the 2-7 just spotted it.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.460
Tell them to maintain visual.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.029
Don't apprehend
until we get there.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.964
Right! Central,
SVU detectives en route.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.466
Blue Chevy.
Those are the cops.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.036
7 Anti-crime, Take 'em.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.603
(male voice)
Copy that.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.573
[sirens blare]

14:36.443 --> 14:37.577
Police! Freeze!

14:37.610 --> 14:39.379
Stay in the car!

14:39.412 --> 14:40.447
Palms up!

14:40.480 --> 14:41.681
Hands on the dash!
Palms up!

14:41.714 --> 14:43.416
Don't shoot!

14:43.450 --> 14:46.219
We didn't do anything!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.089
This car is stolen.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.090
No, my friend Justin

14:50.123 --> 14:51.291
switched with me!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.425
What about Carrie?

14:52.459 --> 14:53.693
She was with him.
Is she okay?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.495
She was crying.
Like they had a fight.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.529
Carrie walked away,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.698
but Justin grabbed her
and put her in the car.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434
What car?
Mine.
It's a '99 Mitsubishi.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.503
Silver.
I have the registration.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.405
Something bad happen?
He kidnapped her.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.673
They say where
they were going?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.942
No.
Is this your phone?

15:08.976 --> 15:11.278
No, it's Justin's.
We switched that too.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.645
His only has
local service.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.681
Let's see who he called last.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.950
Yes, Carrie called me.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.351
Did she tell you
where she is?

15:18.385 --> 15:20.020
You know, I can't confirm
or deny that.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.955
This is no time
for legal crap, Simone.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.057
Her boyfriend kidnapped her.
So, y say.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.959
After he murdered
her mother.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.727
Olivia, any conversation
I have with Carrie

15:27.760 --> 15:29.462
is privileged information.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.698
And you don't know Justin
murdered Denise Eldridge.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.700
He left his coat
at the crime scene.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.703
When was that?
Today or last week?

15:36.736 --> 15:38.471
I asked you
to help Carrie.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.606
I am helping her.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.408
She is my client.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.309
Your client is with a guy

15:42.342 --> 15:44.277
who beat her mother
to a bloody pulp.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.014
If there's a crime
being committed here,

15:47.047 --> 15:48.281
there is no privilege.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.549
And you're obstructing justice.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.684
I have not confirmed
what I know, Olivia.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.686
So I am not obstructing
a damn thing.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.754
(Novak)
She's right.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.690
How? Our witness says
that Carrie was kidnapped!

15:57.724 --> 15:58.658
It doesn't matter.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.360
The only way Simone Bryce
can break privilege

16:00.393 --> 16:02.495
is if Carrie tells her
that she was abducted.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.997
Listen, I'm late.
Ask for an adjournment.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.999
There is nothing
I can do to help you.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
Yes, Casey, there is.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.137
Get me a subpoena to dump
Simone Bryce's phone.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.539
And when the D.A. asks me
why I need to know

16:12.572 --> 16:14.174
who's calling the Mother Teresa
of Children's Rights,

16:14.207 --> 16:15.642
what do I tell him?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.677
That you're trying to save
a young girl's life.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.683
Simone Bryce's conversations
are privileged.

16:23.716 --> 16:28.721
The numbers of her
incoming calls aren't.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.526
(Morales)
The phone company is dumping
Simone Bryce's phone

16:33.560 --> 16:35.195
and the cell
Justin borrowed.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.197
How long?
They'll email me
as soon as they're done.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.532
Meanwhile, I should take a look
at the text messages

16:39.566 --> 16:42.169
on Justin's cell.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.736
[computer beeps]

16:43.770 --> 16:47.140
(Morales)
This is from 10:12 a.m.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.710
Justin to Carrie:
"We should move in together."

16:50.743 --> 16:54.781
Carrie to Justin:
"Over my mother's dead body."

16:54.814 --> 16:57.184
The murder was
Carrie's idea?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.685
Or wishful thinking.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.787
(Morales)
Justin also called Carrie's
cell phone this morning.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.622
8:56 a.m.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.691
To tell her to come home
after he killed her mother.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.393
[computer chimes]
Email's here.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.461
I called the borrowed
cell phone every half-hour.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.630
Rang, went to voice mail.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.432
(Morales)
After the third time,
went right to voice mail.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.067
He turned it off.
(Stabler)
Smart kid.

17:14.101 --> 17:14.801
Justin probably figured
you were tracking him

17:14.834 --> 17:15.668
by calling the phone.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.805
First call was just before noon.
11:42.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.608
(Morales)
Received at a cell tower
on 125th street.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.775
Called again at 12:30.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.512
Picked up by a tower
in Westchester, Katonah.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.713
They're heading upstate.
Made good time.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.081
(Morales)
Called again around 1:00.

17:28.115 --> 17:28.915
This time they were
in Patterson.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.117
That's when they
turned off the phone.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.186
Were there any calls to Simone
Bryce's office after that?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.854
Two more from the direction
they're heading.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.325
Land line in Stanfordville,
New York at 2:53 and 3:06.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.793
This last one's
nine minutes ago.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.362
Fourth digit of the number
is a nine.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.730
Probably a pay phone.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.798
NYPD?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.367
Benson, Stabler.
Where's the phone?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.368
Across the street.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.237
I got here about ten minutes
after you called,

17:50.270 --> 17:52.105
but your Mitsubishi was
already gone, hasn't been back.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.106
Anybody see them?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.207
An attendant
at the gas station

17:54.241 --> 17:56.843
half-mile up the road
said your suspects got gas,

17:56.876 --> 18:00.147
paid, left, then came back
20 minutes later.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.381
Thanks so much.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.882
Well, they stuck around
for a while.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.118
That little restaurant that
we passed coming in to town.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.753
Maybe they grabbed
a bite to eat there.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.124
'Scuse me.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
Sit wherever you'd like.
Wish we had the time.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.661
Have these two kids
been in here today?

18:14.694 --> 18:15.862
I didn't start
'til 4:00,

18:15.895 --> 18:18.431
but I'll be glad
to ask the day man.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.766
Justin Sharp?
(Benson)
You know him?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
All his life.
He used to work for me.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.803
He lived up here?
Summers.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.838
Parents have a place
about two miles away.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.540
Don't know why he'd
be there now, though.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.841
Hunting season's over.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.611
Are there guns in the house?

18:43.823 --> 18:44.791
[pounding on door]

18:44.824 --> 18:46.159
(Justin)
Who is it?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.827
Detective Benson, Justin.
Open the door.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.162
Please leave us alone.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.197
You're either coming
out here,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.331
or we're coming
in to get you.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.599
(Carrie)
No, Justin, don't!

18:52.632 --> 18:53.733
Okay, all right.
We're coming out.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.637
You got guns, drop 'em.
No guns.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.906
Put your hands on your head,
both of you.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.475
Carrie, are you okay?
Yes.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.943
Justin Sharp,
you're under arrest

19:03.976 --> 19:05.378
for murder and kidnapping.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.646
He didn't kidnap me!

19:06.679 --> 19:07.880
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
If you give up that right,
[groans]

19:09.416 --> 19:10.917
anything you say can
and will be used against you

19:10.950 --> 19:12.252
in a court of law.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.720
You have a right
to an attorney.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.796
(Stabler)
What's wrong, can't stand to
look at your own work?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.698
You hit her 14 times.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.934
Lacerated liver,
fractured ribs.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.869
Punctured lungs.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.371
You bashed her head in so hard,

19:31.404 --> 19:33.473
her brain broke clean
off its stem.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.674
He's innocent until
proven guilty.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.409
(Cragen)
Oh, he's guilty.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.877
His coat was found
at the crime scene,

19:37.910 --> 19:40.513
and a witness saw blood
all over his shirt.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.948
That coat could have
been there for weeks.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.550
And we'd really like
to see those clothes.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.984
That is,
if you have them.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.619
Same witness says he saw
you force Carrie

19:46.653 --> 19:47.687
into the car you stole.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.522
(Lanagan)
If this person can make
a positive I.D.,

19:49.556 --> 19:51.458
why hasn't Justin
stood in a lineup?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.328
(Lanagan)
That's what I thought.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.431
No physical evidence.
No positive I.D.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.699
But motive.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.334
Denise Eldridge was
ruining your life.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.602
She wanted you
charged with rape.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.870
You were going to prison.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.305
You kill her,
she's off your back.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.508
You get Carrie.
How's that sound?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.243
I didn't do it.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.311
(Cragen)
Aw, come on, Justin.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.613
We saw Carrie's text message
on your cell phone.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.948
You know, only way you were
ever gonna be together

20:15.982 --> 20:19.652
was over her mother's
dead body?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.454
It's gonna go
so much easier on you,

20:21.488 --> 20:23.956
if you just tell us the truth.

20:25.792 --> 20:29.028
I didn't kill Carrie's mother.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.764
This was Carrie's idea,
wasn't it?

20:31.798 --> 20:35.602
No.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.372
It was her lawyer's.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.576
I told Carrie minors have
a better chance

20:43.610 --> 20:45.445
of being emancipated
if their parents are dead

20:45.478 --> 20:46.946
and there's no
appointed guardian.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.350
I wasn't suggesting
someone kill her mother.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.285
Carrie, you have to tell me
what happened.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.386
(Carrie)
I don't know what happened.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.555
Stop protecting him.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.823
She's in shock, Olivia.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.891
We know that Justin
was in your apartment.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.026
I didn't see him there.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.193
You had to.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.596
You were right outside
with him when he stole the car.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.064
Why can't you just
leave us alone?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.033
Because he murdered
your mother.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.801
And unless you tell us
what you know,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.337
he's gonna get away with it.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.441
I love him.
He's all I have.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.811
Simone, I need her help.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.015
Can I please go?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.519
I'm taking her home.
Come on.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.697
Carrie knows exactly
what happened.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.332
If she doesn't give it up,

21:39.366 --> 21:41.668
the case against Justin
is circumstantial at best.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.703
You know, I'd really like
to find those bloody clothes.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.938
Where would you like us to
search that we haven't already?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.073
He could have dumped
them anywhere

21:47.106 --> 21:48.207
between here
and Duchess County.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.976
All right, well then,
Justin or Carrie have to talk.

21:50.009 --> 21:53.546
They are not going
to tell us anything.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.981
They could have told
somebody else.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.015
Like who?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.550
I don't know.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.051
But you're probably going
to vent to somebody

21:59.085 --> 22:00.520
if you hate your girlfriend's
mother so much

22:00.553 --> 22:01.554
you want to kill her.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.790
Or, Carrie may have confided
in one of her friends.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.526
We recreate the movements
before their murder.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.096
Maybe we turn up somebody
who saw or heard something.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.067
(Principal)
Carrie was in her first
two classes yesterday.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.936
But nobody saw her
after second period.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.871
And that ends around 9:00.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.474
Did her teachers notice anything
unusual about her behavior?

22:21.508 --> 22:22.975
Mm-mm, not that anybody
reported to me.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.412
Did something happen
to Carrie at home?

22:25.445 --> 22:26.979
What would make you ask that?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.748
Carrie's been having
problems here at school.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.050
She's absent a lot.
Doesn't focus.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.519
Falls asleep in class.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.953
(Fin)
That sounds like drugs.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.389
Her mother had her tested.
Everything came back negative.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.590
She hang out with that crowd?

22:37.624 --> 22:38.758
She doesn't hang out
with anybody.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.460
She pretty much keeps
to herself.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.061
(Munch)
You have any other
contact with her?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.696
Oh, about two weeks ago.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.997
One of her teachers told me

22:45.031 --> 22:46.065
that she didn't
have a winter coat.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.034
Then another teacher sent
her down to the office

22:48.067 --> 22:49.902
because one of her shoes
fell apart.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.971
You call her mother?
Of course.

22:52.004 --> 22:52.905
But she didn't seem to care.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.107
But then when Carrie
cut school last week,

22:55.141 --> 22:57.009
her mother flipped out.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.411
Sent a truant officer
to the store

22:58.445 --> 23:00.847
where Carrie's
boyfriend works.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.749
(manager)
I told Justin,
if Carrie came by again

23:02.782 --> 23:05.084
when she was supposed to be in
school, I'd have to let him go.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.519
(Benson)
Justin a slacker?

23:06.553 --> 23:08.120
The opposite.
Always on time.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.857
Great with the customers.
Hard worker.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.625
I want to promote him
to assistant manager.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.960
So what's stopping you?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.595
Spends too much time talking
to his girlfriend

23:15.628 --> 23:16.663
on the web cam.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.698
I caught him at it
again yesterday.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.633
We were told he wasn't scheduled
to work yesterday.

23:20.667 --> 23:21.701
He wasn't.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.971
I asked him to fill in
for someone who was sick.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.105
What time did he come in?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.640
Right at 10:00.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.141
But he left 15 minutes later.

23:29.175 --> 23:29.976
He say why?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.878
Emergency.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.145
Then he called back at 2:00

23:33.179 --> 23:35.081
and asked for the rest
of the week off.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.050
Any chance that conversation
he had with Carrie was recorded?

23:38.084 --> 23:41.020
It's probably on one
of our servers.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.555
(Justin on video)
Carrie what's wrong?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.190
Can you come over
to my house?

23:44.223 --> 23:46.759
What's wrong?
Why are you home?
I need you, please.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.761
Look, something bad happened.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.863
Okay, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.632
(Carrie)
Okay.

23:52.665 --> 23:53.866
Carrie got there first.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.901
Keep watching.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.937
[panting nervously]

23:58.971 --> 24:00.039
[remote clicks]

24:00.072 --> 24:04.143
(Stabler)
There's blood on her shirt.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.779
You gonna tell us
what really happened?

24:06.813 --> 24:07.947
I have nothing to say.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.816
This is when
you should talk, Justin.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.818
They know you're innocent.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.020
I know you're in love
with Carrie.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.123
But nobody is worth going
to prison for 25 years.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.891
(Benson)
How much can she love you?

24:18.925 --> 24:21.628
She's willing to let you
go to jail

24:21.661 --> 24:24.897
for something that she did?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.166
Can they arrest Carrie
based on that tape?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.736
No, it doesn't prove
that she murdered her mother.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.171
Then I'm not saying anything.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.116
What's the problem here,
Olivia?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.052
Your client has been

24:46.085 --> 24:47.253
lying to us all along.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.755
Both to you
and to me.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.189
I'm not lying.
Save it, Carrie.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.124
Justin told us everything.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.161
He wouldn't do that.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.130
He said that he called you
yesterday.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.868
And that's why you left school
after second period.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.235
I don't believe you.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.671
Okay, Carrie,
I will handle this.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.138
How you were covered
with blood

25:06.172 --> 25:08.608
when you called him
on the web cam at work.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.076
(Bryce)
Olivia, stop.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.945
You said that something
terrible happened.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.081
And how you begged him
to leave work and to help you--

25:15.114 --> 25:16.315
No.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.150
And how he made you
take a shower

25:18.184 --> 25:19.251
to wipe off your mother's blood.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.620
Okay, this interview
is over.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.121
Justin loves me.
I have to see him.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.856
Oh, I'm sorry, Carrie,
but we let him go

25:23.890 --> 25:25.191
after he told us
what you did.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.893
Carrie don't listen to her.
Let's go.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.628
We searched the sinks
and the shower drains

25:28.661 --> 25:29.962
in your apartment.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.165
And we found blood
and hairs just like yours.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
(Bryce)
Carrie, come on.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.170
(Benson)
I understand why you wanted
to kill your mother.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.039
But how could you let
the man that you love

25:40.072 --> 25:42.141
take a murder rap for you?

25:42.174 --> 25:44.210
I didn't want him to.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.311
(Bryce)
Carrie--

25:45.344 --> 25:48.881
But he said that it was
the only way to protect us.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.250
That you couldn't prove
who did it if we didn't talk.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.985
Don't say another word.
I don't care!

25:53.019 --> 25:58.224
It doesn't matter because
Justin doesn't love me anymore.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.158
[gasps]

25:59.191 --> 26:00.827
I did it.
I killed her.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.830
Do whatever you want with me.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.866
[crying]

26:17.309 --> 26:18.344
(male officer)
Right this way.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.813
Carrie?
Justin?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.882
She said you were--

26:22.915 --> 26:24.250
Why did you tell them
everything?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.085
No, I swear, I didn't
say a thing!

26:26.118 --> 26:29.188
But they saw you.
They saw you on the web cam.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.191
You lied to me?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.128
She can't do that,
can she?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.096
They do it all the time.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.631
That's why I told you
to stop.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.768
You lying bitch!
I hate you!

26:41.801 --> 26:43.202
I hate you!

26:43.235 --> 26:44.937
I hate you,
you lying bitch!

26:44.971 --> 26:47.640
You lying bitch!
I hate you!

26:47.674 --> 26:51.110
You ruined my life,
you lying bitch!

26:57.416 --> 26:59.385
Hey, how'd it go?

26:59.418 --> 27:01.688
Judge remanded Carrie
to Bridges.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.990
At least she won't
be at Rikers.

27:04.023 --> 27:08.327
I really misjudged her.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.764
All I saw was a desperate
teen needing help.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.800
Look, I saw my daughter going
out with a grown man.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.435
Sometimes it's hard to keep
your own crap out of the work.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.806
Speaking of crap,
psych defense.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.744
Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.746
PMS made her do it.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.715
You're not buying this,
are you?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.116
What, that we can't
control our emotions

27:30.149 --> 27:31.684
because we're premenstrual?

27:31.718 --> 27:32.819
Yeah, that's bull.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.253
We're not talking about PMS.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.455
Women with Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder

27:36.488 --> 27:39.258
experience severe headaches,
depression, and paranoia.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.827
Sometimes,
they even hallucinate

27:40.860 --> 27:42.795
or hear voices.
That's not Carrie.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.430
Anger made her
kill her mother.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.832
Judging from the crime scene
photos,

27:45.865 --> 27:46.598
I'd say it's very possible

27:46.632 --> 27:47.867
that she lost control
of herself.

27:47.900 --> 27:51.137
Great, so she's gonna get off
because of this Twinkie defense?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.239
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Examine Carrie.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.843
Find me a way
to beat Simone Bryce.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.914
(Carrie)
I got my period
when I was twelve,

28:01.948 --> 28:04.951
and that's when
the migraines started.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.920
Did you have
any other problems?

28:07.954 --> 28:13.726
I was happy one minute
and crying the next.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.762
All the time?

28:15.795 --> 28:18.965
Except for, like,
the ten days after my period.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.902
Carrie, did you ever tell
your mother about this?

28:22.935 --> 28:25.471
She said I was being
a drama queen.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.840
Did you tell your doctor?

28:27.874 --> 28:29.976
He told me to take
a muscle relaxant

28:30.009 --> 28:33.179
and use a heating pad.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.848
Sometimes those cramps
were so bad

28:35.882 --> 28:38.150
that I didn't even want
to go to school.

28:38.184 --> 28:41.287
But my mother made me.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.191
How did that make
you feel?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.160
Angry.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.397
She didn't want me to be happy.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.801
Like with Justin.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.072
Nobody ever loved her
the way he loves me.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.809
And that's not my fault.

29:04.977 --> 29:08.981
She didn't know how
to love anyone except herself.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.885
Did she love you?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.925
I don't know.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.529
I think that's
why I killed her.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.100
What do you remember?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.571
Nothing.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.843
One second we were talking,
and then the next,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.310
she was just lying on the floor.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.980
I was covered in blood.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.086
I started crying.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.421
Called Justin on the web cam.

29:49.455 --> 29:54.326
And I felt so sleepy.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.497
So you believe her story?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.466
It's consistent
with PMDD.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.869
It could've triggered
a manic outburst.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.871
What about the calm
after the storm?

30:04.904 --> 30:06.572
Carrie was dissociating.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.107
I read her medical reports.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.076
Heavy cramping and migraines
are documented.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.510
If you add to that
the mood swings

30:11.543 --> 30:12.644
and the fact that
she was premenstrual

30:12.678 --> 30:15.214
when she killed her mother,
then it's classic PMDD.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.984
Ugh, do you think a jury
will really believe this?

30:18.017 --> 30:19.986
They have before.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.121
Came back with a manslaughter
conviction for a young woman

30:22.154 --> 30:24.991
charged with bludgeoning
her mother to death in England.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.592
That's where Simone Bryce
got her inspiration.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.328
If it'll work over there,
it'll work over here.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.100
(Justin)
I left work right after
Carrie called me.

30:34.133 --> 30:37.369
When I got to the apartment,
Carrie let me in

30:37.403 --> 30:39.205
and I checked on Mrs. Eldridge

30:39.238 --> 30:41.307
to see if she was
still breathing.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.342
That's how I got
her blood on me.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.178
And then I told Carrie
that we had to get out of there.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.580
And how did Carrie react?

30:48.614 --> 30:51.984
She put on her coat

30:52.018 --> 30:53.452
like a zombie or something.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.555
I was so freaked out,
I forgot mine.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.057
And then we left.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.192
(Bryce)
And where did you take her?

31:00.226 --> 31:02.594
Out to the street.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.063
We couldn't get a cab.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.098
And Carrie
could barely walk,

31:06.132 --> 31:09.235
so I had to drag her.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.103
And she started screaming.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.305
Was that the first time
you ever heard her scream?

31:13.339 --> 31:14.540
Uh, no, no.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.376
It happened a lot.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.412
It was kind of like
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.648
One second she's fine,

31:22.681 --> 31:25.584
and then she would
just lose it.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.988
Nothing further.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.961
Justin, did Carrie tell you
she killed her mother?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.567
Your Honor?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.369
Answer the question,
Mr. Sharp.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.973
I don't want to.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.041
(Judge)
You don't have that option.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.676
Answer, or you'll be
in contempt of court.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.611
Fine.

31:52.644 --> 31:57.616
I'll never say anything
to hurt you.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.385
(Judge)
Step down,
you're in contempt.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.988
Officer, take him
to the lockup.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.302
I love you...
no matter what.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.043
Hey, you on a case?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.345
Eldridge.
Defense is recalling us.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.447
They must be desperate.
Well, they are.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.049
Carrie's going down.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.417
So now they want to
dirty up her mother.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.985
Portray her as a drunk.
What?

32:33.019 --> 32:35.988
Wait, was she?

32:36.022 --> 32:38.157
Her blood alcohol level
was normal when she died.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.692
But Denise Eldridge had
advanced cirrhosis.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.528
Another two years,
it would have killed her.

32:42.561 --> 32:46.065
Are you sure it's
from the drinking?

32:46.098 --> 32:48.134
I didn't find any
hepatitis antibodies,

32:48.167 --> 32:50.202
so it has to be the booze.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.232
[knock on door]

33:55.301 --> 33:57.769
No wonder I hated
Denise so much.

33:57.803 --> 34:01.640
All along, Carrie was just
trying to get me to protect her.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.343
Look at this.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.644
Denise didn't care
about her daughter.

34:05.677 --> 34:06.578
All she cared about

34:06.612 --> 34:09.215
was where she was
gonna get her next drink.

34:11.250 --> 34:15.687
Why'd you come here?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.290
To find out what else
I was wrong about.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.094
These pots and pans haven't
been used in so long,

34:22.128 --> 34:23.662
they got cobwebs on 'em.

34:23.695 --> 34:27.299
Sounds like the ones
in my kitchen.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.367
Hey, check this out.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.668
I found it underneath
the cabinet.

34:32.538 --> 34:35.407
Birth control pills.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.609
Prescribed to Carrie
by the Free Clinic?

34:37.643 --> 34:39.478
Hmm.

34:39.511 --> 34:43.682
Carrie was on day six
of her period.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.320
(Bryce)
Is that supposed
to mean something?

34:48.354 --> 34:51.223
(Benson)
Yeah.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.524
It means that Carrie
wasn't crazy

34:52.558 --> 34:54.360
when she killed her mother.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.262
(Bryce)
How could you know that?

34:56.295 --> 34:59.165
Women who suffer
from PMDD

34:59.198 --> 35:02.401
always have one week where
they don't have any symptoms.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.371
All their anxiety,
psychosis, depression is gone.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.539
One normal week
starting from around

35:07.573 --> 35:09.441
day four of their period.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.844
Carrie killed her mother
on day six.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.281
Which means she couldn't
have had any symptoms.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.817
I was early this month.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.488
You put this defense
in her head.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.591
She tied my hands
behind my back

35:25.624 --> 35:27.626
and wouldn't let me
tell the whole story.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.461
About the drinking.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.862
(Bryce)
Yeah.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.467
(Benson)
You didn't want
anyone to know.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.603
You were too ashamed.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.540
Carrie.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.478
Tell me what really happened.

35:48.547 --> 35:53.219
It--it can't hurt you anymore.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.529
I was at school that day

36:03.562 --> 36:08.234
when Justin called me on my cell
and told me that--

36:08.267 --> 36:11.603
he told me that he didn't
want to see me anymore,

36:11.637 --> 36:14.706
because he was afraid
of my mother.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.843
And I tried to deal,

36:17.876 --> 36:19.578
but I just couldn't.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.614
So I went home.

36:22.648 --> 36:26.952
My mother was there.

36:26.985 --> 36:31.923
And I, I tried to talk to her.
I really did.

36:31.957 --> 36:36.362
But she--she just picked up
a bottle and started drinking.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.996
[sniffles]

36:38.029 --> 36:40.899
She said that if she
couldn't put Justin in prison,

36:40.932 --> 36:43.669
that she was gonna get him
fired from his job.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.537
She was gonna do
anything she could

36:45.571 --> 36:48.574
so that he wouldn't
love me anymore.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.008
And I told her that

36:50.041 --> 36:51.643
I would always be with Justin.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.245
And that I'd rather
be homeless

36:53.279 --> 36:56.982
than spend another
minute with her.

36:57.015 --> 37:01.487
And then she slapped me
really hard.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.323
[sobs]

37:04.356 --> 37:07.959
She called me a slut.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.597
And she hit me again.
And again.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.633
And again.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.504
And I just lost it.

37:18.537 --> 37:23.342
I grabbed a lamp.

37:23.375 --> 37:27.379
And I hit her over
and over and over.

37:29.315 --> 37:33.251
[sniffles]
I loved my mom very much.

37:35.321 --> 37:40.359
But when she was drunk,
she wasn't a mother.

37:40.392 --> 37:43.395
[sobbing]

38:04.816 --> 38:07.519
Olivia, what are
you going to do?

38:07.553 --> 38:09.087
I have to tell the D.A.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.525
Hold on.

38:13.559 --> 38:16.362
You know it wasn't murder.

38:16.395 --> 38:20.399
Why didn't you present
that as evidence?

38:20.432 --> 38:22.601
She refused to talk about it.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.776
You remember
what that was like.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.686
You shouldn't have talked
to Carrie and Bryce without me.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.120
I know.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.723
You did a good job with
the birth control pills though.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.392
Jury will definitely convict.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.763
Plead her out, Casey.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.902
You just won it for us.
Why?

39:01.473 --> 39:04.443
My mother was
an English professor.

39:04.476 --> 39:08.146
When I was 16, I started dating
one of her students.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.716
He was a senior.
He was 21 years old.

39:10.749 --> 39:14.586
And he asked me to marry him.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.455
And I said yes.

39:16.488 --> 39:20.626
Because I wanted to get
away from my mother.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.394
She found out,
and she told me

39:22.428 --> 39:24.162
that if I didn't
stop seeing him,

39:24.195 --> 39:26.432
that she would have him
kicked out of college.

39:26.465 --> 39:30.101
And I told her that I was
moving out.

39:30.135 --> 39:33.405
She was halfway through
a bottle of vodka.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.006
And she dropped it.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.576
It shattered all over
the floor and...

39:40.045 --> 39:41.146
And then she picked up

39:41.179 --> 39:45.851
the jagged edge
of the bottle and...

39:45.884 --> 39:48.420
and she came at me.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.122
Screaming...

39:51.156 --> 39:53.625
"I'll never let anyone
else have you."

39:58.163 --> 40:00.599
And so I kicked her.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.802
Hard.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.837
And then I kicked her again.

40:05.871 --> 40:10.842
And she went flying
across the room into the wall.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.979
Then she slid down
to the floor.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.651
I'd never hurt her before.

40:19.685 --> 40:23.489
I ran out.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.725
I was so afraid.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.898
You didn't kill
your mother, Olivia.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.804
I know what it's like
to want to.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.113
That's how I know
Simone Bryce.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.616
I called her back then.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.118
She was a law student.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.589
And she helped me
survive it.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.495
Why didn't Carrie
say something?

41:06.632 --> 41:09.768
Because then
the abuse becomes real.

41:11.036 --> 41:14.139
If you keep quiet...

41:14.172 --> 41:16.775
you can pretend that it's not.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.984
(Judge)
Are the people satisfied
that the conditions

41:26.017 --> 41:27.919
of the plea agreement
have been met?

41:27.953 --> 41:29.154
(Novak)
Yes, Your Honor.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.757
The defendant will rise.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.861
Carrie Lynn Eldridge,

41:35.894 --> 41:37.629
I find you guilty
of Manslaughter

41:37.663 --> 41:38.997
and sentence you to five years

41:39.030 --> 41:41.266
in the custody of the State
Department of Correction.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.300
We're adjourned.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.169
[gavel bangs]

42:00.952 --> 42:04.656
She'll be in a juvenile
facility, no hard time.

42:04.690 --> 42:05.791
I polled the jury.

42:05.824 --> 42:08.594
11 of them thought
she was guilty.

42:08.627 --> 42:09.928
You had your Murder Two
conviction.

42:09.961 --> 42:10.962
I know.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.000
Why'd you plead her out?
