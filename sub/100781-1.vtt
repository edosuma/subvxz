00:00.568 --> 00:03.002
[majestic music]

00:05.606 --> 00:09.341
[thunder crashing]

00:09.377 --> 00:12.378
[dramatic music]

00:12.413 --> 00:14.513
I'm so sorry, baby, I thought
we could outrun this storm.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.948
Don't worry, we got this.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.350
Mammoth tower, this is Cessna
November 6398 Charlie,

00:18.386 --> 00:21.253
traveling 1-4-1
16 miles east of your position.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.088
Juliet, do you copy?

00:23.124 --> 00:26.058
[lightning strikes]

00:26.093 --> 00:27.359
That's not good;
call it in.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.794
Mammoth tower,
Mayday, Mayday.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.597
We've got a stalled engine,
and...

00:31.632 --> 00:32.631
The radio's dead.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.665
We gotta land.

00:35.803 --> 00:39.805
Mayday! Mayday! Latitude 37.9,
longitude -108.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.409
Mayday! Latitude 37.9,
longitude -108!

00:44.545 --> 00:46.879
[glass shattering]

00:49.083 --> 00:51.450
[equipment beeping]

00:58.125 --> 00:59.124
[Dr. Hammond]
Tanya?

01:00.127 --> 01:01.560
I'm Dr. Hammond.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.597
You're in Mammoth Hospital.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.332
You were in a plane crash.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.834
Do you remember?

01:08.869 --> 01:11.203
[faint utterance]

01:12.940 --> 01:15.441
Where... where is he?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.176
The man who was
in the plane with you?

01:20.347 --> 01:22.514
He didn't survive.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.084
I'm sorry.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.586
[she weeps softly]

01:27.621 --> 01:29.988
[somber music]

01:32.726 --> 01:35.094
[upbeat music]

01:53.614 --> 01:55.514
[Margaret]
I don't care about
your wife's problem, Javier.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.615
Turn around and talk to me.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.451
When my water broke,
I drove myself to the hospital.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.054
And the day after delivery,
I was back at the job.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.022
So tell your wife
to suck it up.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.457
And you, ha!

02:05.493 --> 02:07.326
You better get your ass
to work on time

02:07.361 --> 02:08.293
or you're outta here.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.162
-Comprende?
-I don't have to listen to this.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.930
Don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.466
I know you're drinking my decaf
and I don't appreciate it.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.335
It's the one luxury
I have in this life.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.790
[Tanya]
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to flight school!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.025
My name is Tanya Jackson

02:40.060 --> 02:43.162
and I will be your tour guide
through this amazing adventure.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.564
[laughter]

02:48.869 --> 02:51.637
Today, I am gonna start
by introducing you

02:51.672 --> 02:53.639
to some of the dials
that you will find

02:53.674 --> 02:55.240
in a real cockpit.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.742
The altimeter,

02:56.777 --> 02:59.244
vertical speed,
airspeed, heading,

02:59.280 --> 03:02.481
and my favorite horizontal
friend at 3,000 feet,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.750
the attitude indicator.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.118
I'll let you guys take a look.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.853
Before we get started,
I wanna meet everybody.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.654
Hi.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.156
What's your name?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.891
J-Jake Sherman.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.194
[Jacob]
Hi!

03:15.229 --> 03:16.295
You must be Tanya.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.763
Jacob Mathews.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.665
Nice to meet you,
Captain Mathews.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.266
Uh, call me Jake.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.601
And that was
your first takeoff!

03:22.636 --> 03:23.502
[Tanya]
Woo-hoo!

03:23.537 --> 03:24.570
Nice to meet you, Jake.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.004
Don't worry,
we got this.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.008
So, Jake.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.878
What do you do?

03:32.913 --> 03:37.449
I'm operations manager
at MetroTech.

03:37.484 --> 03:42.521
We make, uh, lighting fixtures
for houses and office buildings.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.756
Hm. Sounds interesting.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.159
It's not,
I hate it.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.127
[laughter]

03:49.163 --> 03:50.896
Why do you want to learn
how to fly?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.131
[Jake]
I've always been
interested in doing it.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.200
I mean, if I can.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.568
I hear it's really tough,

03:56.604 --> 03:58.637
so I don't even know
if it's possible for me.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.439
I just came by today
to check it out

04:00.474 --> 04:02.241
-and see if maybe--
-Jake?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.276
Yeah?

04:04.311 --> 04:05.244
It's possible.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.679
That's what I'm here for.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.083
[he sighs]

04:11.118 --> 04:13.485
[pensive music]

04:25.499 --> 04:27.866
[sniffling]

04:34.808 --> 04:35.974
[softly gasps]

04:46.420 --> 04:47.586
Jake!

04:49.456 --> 04:52.157
Oh! You came back!

04:57.364 --> 04:59.464
[Jake]
So what'd your professor
think of your outline?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.300
He liked it, but to qualify
as a dissertation,

05:01.335 --> 05:02.934
I have to interview
more survivors.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.836
You've already done
a ton of interviews.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.572
Tell me about it;
this doctorate thing never ends.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.074
You know what?
Let's get away.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.208
Let's go on vacation,

05:10.244 --> 05:12.144
somewhere like Hawaii
or something.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.578
[Jake]
Hawaii's expensive.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.280
And after they raised
your tuition?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.384
We ain't got it.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.552
You're no fun!

05:20.587 --> 05:22.554
[doorbell rings]

05:22.589 --> 05:24.222
-That's my mom.
-Oh man, now?

05:24.258 --> 05:26.525
She's just gonna
be a minute, shh!

05:26.560 --> 05:27.826
[Margaret]
Hi, sweetheart.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.027
[Annie]
Hi, Mom.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.630
Thank you for bringing these.
You didn't have to wash them.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.232
It was such a great party
the other night, wasn't it?

05:34.268 --> 05:35.767
Where the hell'd you go
this afternoon?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.936
Hi, Margaret.
So nice of you to join us.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.572
You think you can leave at 2:00
and I'm not gonna notice?

05:40.607 --> 05:42.541
[Annie]
Don't talk about work
when we're at home, remember?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.109
We have an agreement.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.777
Yeah. But your husband
also agreed

05:45.813 --> 05:47.879
he was gonna run
the entire shop in six months.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.247
It's what your father wanted.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.716
I finished the inventory.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.517
Woulda been sitting around
the rest of my shift.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.119
That's not the point!

05:54.154 --> 05:56.955
How'm I gonna promote you
over Randy or Ted

05:56.990 --> 05:58.724
or any of the other guys
if you disappear

05:58.759 --> 05:59.958
in the middle
of the afternoon?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.193
Listen to me.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.562
I've got a big investors meeting
in Santa Barbara next month.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.530
I've gotta be able
to look them in the eye

06:05.566 --> 06:08.100
and convince them
you can run it when I retire.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.468
I'm taking flying lessons.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.069
[Margaret]
Flying lessons?

06:11.105 --> 06:12.637
[she cackles]

06:12.673 --> 06:14.840
You are gonna fly a plane?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.809
Don't you have to be, like,
smart to do that?

06:17.845 --> 06:19.344
[Annie]
Mom, please!

06:19.380 --> 06:20.645
[Jake]
Are you staying for dinner?

06:20.681 --> 06:21.947
Should I make you a plate?

06:21.982 --> 06:24.916
Don't even bother.
I'm leaving.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.953
Look. If this little airplane
hobby of yours

06:27.988 --> 06:29.554
gets in the way of work,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.957
you and I are gonna have
a problem.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.792
Do we have a problem, Jake?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.395
No. We don't.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.396
Good.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.697
Don't say anything.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.931
Here's $2,000.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.033
Just take it, baby,
I know you need it.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.435
I'll see you later.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.103
I'll see you at work.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.141
And I really like
the instructor,

06:49.176 --> 06:50.909
she's got tons
of experience.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.012
Can't wait to get started.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.782
What's the matter?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.650
If we don't have money
to go on vacations,

06:58.685 --> 07:00.485
how can you afford
flying lessons?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.354
I checked
and they're not cheap.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.890
No, they're not.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.391
Why didn't you tell me?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.260
I wanted to surprise you.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.962
Look, what I really wanna do
is get my own airplane.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.431
That way,
we can go on vacation

07:12.466 --> 07:14.599
anytime we want,
anywhere in the world.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.068
How are you gonna pay for this?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.271
And where are we supposed
to keep an airplane?

07:19.306 --> 07:20.739
In the backyard?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.775
Okay, you wanna know
why I didn't tell you?

07:23.811 --> 07:25.343
Because every time
we talk about something

07:25.379 --> 07:27.179
that I wanna do,
you shoot it down.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.314
No, I don't.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.715
Yes, you do.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.921
Do you really think
you're gonna learn how to fly?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.689
Aren't you supposed to know
a little bit about

07:37.724 --> 07:39.291
math and physics?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.425
I mean, no offense, babe,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.160
but you barely graduated
high school.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.530
Wow.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.666
Thanks.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.134
I'm sorry.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.402
I didn't mean it like that.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.570
Yeah, you did.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.339
You're a writer, you know
exactly what you mean to say.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.611
You're right.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.812
I did mean it like that.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.881
I just don't think you have
the self-discipline it takes

08:02.916 --> 08:04.850
to be a pilot.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.451
If it wasn't for me
literally pushing you

08:06.487 --> 08:07.619
out of bed every morning,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.387
you'd never make it
to work on time.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.957
It's bad enough I have to work
for your mother all day.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.192
Now I have
to sleep with her too?

08:14.228 --> 08:16.595
Terrific.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.430
I can't believe
you just said that to me!

08:18.465 --> 08:21.533
-Look. I'm just saying--
-No! Don't touch me.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.602
That's the worst thing
you can say to a woman,

08:23.637 --> 08:25.370
is that I remind you
of your mother-in-law.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.106
Well, you sounded
just like her right now.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.675
You can go sleep in the living
room if you feel that way.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.711
-Baby, come on.
-No! I'm serious.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.179
If you don't wanna
sleep with me

08:34.214 --> 08:36.014
because I remind you
of my mother,

08:36.049 --> 08:37.549
then go.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.417
Sleep in the living room.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.820
[soft music]

08:55.168 --> 08:56.368
[she sighs]

08:58.272 --> 08:59.638
[Jake]
Cable traffic,

08:59.673 --> 09:02.974
Cessna Five Nine Two Romeo
is taxiing to 2-4.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.809
Now tell him
you're taking off on 2-4.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.912
Taking off on 2-4.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.981
Departure to the, uh, west.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.816
Great, that's all you gotta say.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.318
Now take your foot
off the brake,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.320
pull back on the yoke,
right hand on your throttle,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.555
yep.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.157
Now head right for the 2-7 sign
and then you just swoop around

09:19.192 --> 09:21.192
so you have a good, clear
shot of the final.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.763
Good. Okay,
and nice and smooth...

09:24.798 --> 09:27.832
all the way to full power.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.401
Now, anticipate
the airplane's gonna want

09:29.436 --> 09:31.770
to yaw to the left
because of the torque.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.440
[simulated engine roar]

09:35.475 --> 09:37.676
There you go,
that's your first takeoff.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.078
[applause and congratulations]

09:47.287 --> 09:49.654
[suspenseful music]

09:58.332 --> 10:00.765
Now, bring it up to 1300.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.901
Turn on your crosswind light.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.336
[click]

10:04.371 --> 10:05.804
Now, take a left.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.606
You're gonna take your foot
off the right rudder

10:07.641 --> 10:08.707
to come left.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.241
[beeping]

10:10.277 --> 10:12.410
No, the right rudder
to come left.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.113
No--right rudder,
not the left.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.848
Not so quick on the yoke.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.084
Oh! Don't overcompensate
so much, no...

10:19.119 --> 10:21.486
[rapid beeping]

10:22.856 --> 10:24.756
[sound of explosion]

10:24.791 --> 10:26.691
That's okay, that's what
flight simulators are for.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.429
Ms. Jackson?

10:31.465 --> 10:34.666
Hey, Jake!
Please--please call me Tanya.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.035
Tanya, um,
I'm just curious.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.403
How'm I doing?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.005
Oh gosh,
don't worry about today.

10:40.040 --> 10:40.905
You sure?

10:40.941 --> 10:42.741
Because if I don't
have what it takes,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.075
you'll be honest
with me, right?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.477
It takes practice,
you know?

10:45.512 --> 10:47.112
Just--you gotta
put in the time.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.314
Flight time,
simulator time,

10:49.349 --> 10:50.782
lots and lots of time.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.251
Right. Yeah.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.452
Thank you.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.424
Hey, Jake?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.226
What are you doing right now?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.595
[lively music]

11:07.000 --> 11:08.400
Thanks for taking me up.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.601
My pleasure.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.272
Hey, you know,
there's a little box

11:14.307 --> 11:15.573
of airplane parts back there.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.509
I gotta drop 'em off
at a skydiving school

11:17.544 --> 11:18.610
in Palm Springs.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.744
You wanna come with me?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.912
When?

11:20.947 --> 11:22.380
Now.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.648
Now?

11:23.684 --> 11:27.152
Uh... thanks,
but I should get back.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.154
I got an early day tomorrow.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.389
It's only an hour flight,
we'll be back by 8:00.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.758
Oh. Duh.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.327
So is that a yes?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.996
That's a yes!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.398
[chuckling]

11:50.711 --> 11:52.310
So how long you been married?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.047
Your, uh, wedding ring.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.717
Oh. Right.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.186
Um, six years.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.487
You?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.956
Uh, never married.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.791
I, uh, came close, but...

12:06.827 --> 12:08.093
What happened?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.761
He--he died.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.529
In the plane crash.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.264
Oh. Right.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.366
Sorry.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.336
I read about that.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.039
Before I enrolled,
I checked you out.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.540
You probably discovered
that I'm an expert

12:22.576 --> 12:24.142
at what not to do.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.147
I bet your wife's excited
that you're learning how to fly.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.749
Not really.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.886
She's kinda
totally against it.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.256
We got into a big fight
about it.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.557
That's not good.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.128
[Jake]
Yeah, I've been
sleeping on the couch

12:43.163 --> 12:44.629
for the past week.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.630
Mm.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.201
So I have a confession to make.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.570
Actually, it's like
two confessions.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.773
Okay.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.508
When you first
came into my class,

12:56.543 --> 12:59.144
I couldn't take
my eyes off you.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.712
Whoa.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.347
I'm sorry,
does that freak you out?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.682
No, no, no, it's okay.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.985
[self-conscious chuckle]

13:07.020 --> 13:09.220
What's the other confession?

13:11.091 --> 13:13.158
The other one is
about me delivering

13:13.193 --> 13:16.361
the box of airplane parts
to the skydiving school.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.429
Yeah, I don't have to.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.232
I-I made the whole thing up.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.368
Oh.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.205
[Tanya]
I just...

13:27.240 --> 13:29.174
I wanted to spend
a little more time with you.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.242
That's um...

13:33.780 --> 13:35.513
that's really...

13:35.549 --> 13:38.550
There's a hotel
around the corner.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.953
You know, if you wanna
just relax

13:41.988 --> 13:43.321
for a little bit.

13:46.793 --> 13:47.725
I, uh...

13:52.032 --> 13:54.165
I can't,
I should get home.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.969
So you can sleep on the sofa?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.240
So I can sleep on the sofa.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.339
I've never really
done this before.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.407
[chuckling]

15:09.442 --> 15:10.575
[moaning]

15:35.835 --> 15:36.968
I can't.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.407
I'm married, I just...

15:43.743 --> 15:45.877
I'm sorry, I can't.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.445
Uh...

15:49.783 --> 15:50.949
Okay.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.454
Um, just excuse me.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.669
[tense music]

16:15.442 --> 16:16.474
Mayday!

16:16.509 --> 16:18.042
Latitude 37.9--

16:20.046 --> 16:21.212
Jacob Mathews.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.385
[Dr. Hammond]
He didn't survive.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.865
Your wife's a lucky girl.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.236
But you know, she's wrong
about you flying.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.973
That she is.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.876
Let's just forget
any of this ever happened.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.978
I really appreciate that.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.848
I feel, like,
so guilty right now, I just--

16:56.883 --> 16:59.417
Shh, just...
it's okay.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.353
Look, it's our secret, okay?
Nobody has to know.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.922
And look, why don't you bring
your wife to class next Thursday

17:04.958 --> 17:08.359
and I will take you both up,
free of charge?

17:08.395 --> 17:11.262
Maybe if she sees you
in a cockpit,

17:11.297 --> 17:13.164
she'll change her mind
about you being a pilot.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.766
Really?

17:14.801 --> 17:15.967
You'd be okay with that?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.870
Yeah, of course.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.272
[plane's engine droning]

17:22.675 --> 17:23.775
Annie, what are you doing
next Thursday?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.277
You wanna come by class
and see Jake fly next week?

17:26.312 --> 17:28.513
Oh, no, no, please don't.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.982
I have class on Thursdays
until 6:00.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.984
That's too bad.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.819
Hey, Annie, check this out.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.454
[Annie gasps]

17:36.489 --> 17:38.489
[dramatic music]

17:38.525 --> 17:39.624
[Tanya cackles]

17:39.659 --> 17:41.292
Isn't it incredible?

17:41.327 --> 17:42.760
No, not really!

17:42.796 --> 17:44.128
[Jake]
Tanya, I don't
think you should--

17:44.164 --> 17:45.930
When I'm up here,
I feel like a goddess,

17:45.965 --> 17:47.432
like I have wings.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.800
Feel that Annie, huh?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.668
-Do you have wings?
-No, I don't have wings!

17:50.703 --> 17:53.805
-Sure you can't fly?
-Yep! I'm pretty sure.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.239
[Tanya]
Come on, everybody can fly.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.075
It's easy.
I'll teach you.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.543
[Annie]
What are you doing? Stop!

17:58.578 --> 18:00.111
Tanya! What the hell
are you doing?

18:00.146 --> 18:01.345
Please stop!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.747
Jake! This isn't funny!

18:02.782 --> 18:03.981
[Annie screams]

18:04.017 --> 18:05.249
[he screams]

18:05.285 --> 18:07.585
[she laughs]

18:07.620 --> 18:08.820
[Tanya]
Everybody can fly, it's easy.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.321
I'll teach you.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.923
You wanna sign up
for flying lessons?

18:11.958 --> 18:14.792
[Annie]
Uh, no, I'm kinda busy
with school and all.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.461
Oh. That's right, I forgot.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.667
[Tanya chuckles]

18:30.009 --> 18:31.209
See you next Thursday, Jake.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.077
Okay. Thanks, Tanya.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.345
That woman scares me, babe.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.680
She's fine.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.614
She's an adrenaline junkie

18:36.649 --> 18:38.483
and I'm pretty sure
she has a death wish.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.351
She's an incredible pilot

18:40.386 --> 18:41.853
and she's been
really good to me.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.955
Look, I need you
to have my back.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.890
There's a feeling I get
when I'm up there.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.558
I can't explain it,
but it's like

18:47.594 --> 18:49.827
-I was born to do this.
-Would you promise me

18:49.863 --> 18:51.329
you'll be careful?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.431
Unlike...

18:53.466 --> 18:55.399
I promise.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.503
Sorry for what I said
last week.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.904
Me too.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.306
[tender music]

19:05.378 --> 19:07.745
[music turns eerie]

19:09.516 --> 19:11.048
You're not gonna get him.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.586
He's mine.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.262
Just try to keep 80.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.197
Just set whatever pitch
attitude's gonna give you 80.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.298
-Throttle back?
-Nope, nope,

19:27.400 --> 19:28.499
leave the throttle
right where it is.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.967
Put your hand
on the trim wheel.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.169
Yep, just start
trimming it back.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.971
Yeah. There you go.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.973
Now, there's a shopping mall...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.341
Oh. You see those
square buildings

19:37.377 --> 19:38.409
-over there?
-Yeah.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.344
Yeah. I want you
to head for that mall.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.579
I'm gonna let go.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.755
Whoa!

19:50.857 --> 19:52.356
Hey, this is my neighborhood.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.158
Oh, really? Huh.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.661
Why don't you take it down
to about 500 feet?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.198
-That low?
-Yeah, sure, be fine.

20:00.233 --> 20:04.001
[Jake]
My house should be
right about...

20:04.137 --> 20:06.437
[suspenseful music]

20:08.508 --> 20:09.540
there.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.282
[Tanya]
Now, you're gaining airspeed
so you're gonna gain lift,

20:18.318 --> 20:19.550
so when it gets to 100,

20:19.652 --> 20:22.753
I want you to pull the power
back to 2200 RPMs.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.823
Jake? You hear me?

20:25.959 --> 20:26.857
Uh, yeah.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.293
You okay?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.895
I'm good.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.110
[Annie]
Hey, babe.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.311
Guess what I did today?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.047
I got my outline approved.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.682
And the professor loved it!

20:51.718 --> 20:54.085
I didn't have time to cook,
so I went to Whole Foods

20:54.120 --> 20:55.786
and put a down payment
on a dinner.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.555
But don't worry, I got
everything that you like.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.657
Who's the guy?

20:59.759 --> 21:00.992
What guy?

21:01.027 --> 21:03.227
The guy you were kissing
this afternoon.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.229
I wasn't kissing a guy
this afternoon.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.931
Yeah, you were.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.232
Right out there
in the driveway.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.901
-I saw you.
-You saw me?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.404
What, were you taking flying
lessons over the house

21:13.439 --> 21:14.939
or something?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.707
Well, you have our house
mistaken for somebody else's

21:16.743 --> 21:18.442
because I was at school
this afternoon.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.878
I kinda know
what our house looks like.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.447
I saw you kiss him,
and then you took him in here

21:23.549 --> 21:25.383
and you had sex with him,
didn't you?

21:25.485 --> 21:26.617
Didn't you hear me?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.420
I wasn't here this afternoon,
I was at school!

21:29.455 --> 21:30.788
You can ask my professor.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.090
Why don't you just admit it?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.293
You're not attracted
to me anymore.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.560
-What?
-You haven't wanted

21:36.663 --> 21:39.030
to have sex with me
for the past three years.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.165
-That's not true.
-Yes it is.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.900
You know it is.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.002
Look, if you wanna date
other people,

21:45.038 --> 21:46.671
-just tell me.
-What? No! Babe,

21:46.706 --> 21:48.072
I don't wanna date
anybody else.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.675
Look, whatever it is you think
you saw at 30,000 feet,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.176
-it wasn't me.
-You don't go up

21:52.211 --> 21:54.011
-to an altitude that high.
-Okay, whatever,

21:54.113 --> 21:56.280
you have me mistaken
for somebody else.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.581
Do you need your space again?

21:57.684 --> 21:59.216
That's what this is, isn't it?

21:59.285 --> 22:01.919
No! Babe, look,
you're starting to worry me.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.621
I didn't do anything.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.490
Okay. Fine.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.225
You're not gonna admit it.

22:08.361 --> 22:09.593
I'll tell you what.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.995
We need to take
a little break.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.597
What? Where is this coming from?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.700
Until you figure out
what you wanna do,

22:15.802 --> 22:17.702
I'm gonna go stay
at Tom's place for a while.

22:17.737 --> 22:18.969
No!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.371
Look, this is insane.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.606
Could you just slow down
and talk to me, please?

22:22.675 --> 22:23.974
Babe!

22:24.010 --> 22:26.143
Babe, will you knock this off?

22:26.179 --> 22:28.946
Look, will you just stop?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.981
I didn't do anything,
you have this all wrong!

22:31.017 --> 22:34.018
-Babe!
-Don't text me, don't call me.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.252
[car starts]

22:55.041 --> 22:56.807
[Annie]
You can sleep
in the living room

22:56.843 --> 22:58.209
if you feel that way.

23:03.616 --> 23:07.118
[Tanya]
Now, we can't fix
a broken heart, but

23:07.220 --> 23:09.286
with a little tape and glue,

23:09.322 --> 23:10.821
you can fix about
anything else.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.924
Say you crash land
in the middle of nowhere

23:14.026 --> 23:19.296
and injuries are more than
just scrapes and bruises, right?

23:19.332 --> 23:20.865
Well...

23:20.933 --> 23:23.200
Scalpels, splints,
chloroform,

23:23.236 --> 23:25.269
tracheostomy kit,
battery-powered defib,

23:25.304 --> 23:26.404
you name it.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.072
Now, we have an EMT seminar
that covers

23:28.107 --> 23:29.774
everything in this kit,

23:29.876 --> 23:31.776
but do you guys
have any questions?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.644
Okay, all right, well,
great day, everybody.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.113
I'll see you guys next week.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.616
-Thanks, Tanya.
-Bye, Ms. Jackson.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.088
Hey. How you doing?

23:44.123 --> 23:45.856
I'm okay.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.258
Really? You don't seem okay.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.226
What's going on?

23:49.262 --> 23:52.129
Remember when we flew
over my house last week?

23:52.165 --> 23:53.798
Yeah.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.667
Well, I saw Annie
with another guy.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.637
-Oh.
-So I moved out.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.806
We're taking a little break.

24:01.908 --> 24:06.677
I'm, um...
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.712
[Jake]
Yeah. She's just...

24:09.816 --> 24:11.582
I don't know.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.318
Six years, I mean, she's
getting bored with me, I guess.

24:14.353 --> 24:17.421
-Mm.
-Anyway, it is what it is.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.859
Well, does that mean
that your flight instructor

24:21.961 --> 24:23.861
can ask you
what you're doing tonight?

24:23.896 --> 24:26.964
Um... I can't.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.767
Why not? You're not
with her anymore, so...

24:29.902 --> 24:31.869
It's just a little soon.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.904
Come on, do you not like me?

24:33.940 --> 24:36.106
I know you like me, Jake.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.908
It's too soon.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.611
-Sorry.
-Yeah. It's okay.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.219
Bye.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.930
Hey, handsome.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.499
You wanna be a pilot?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.934
Um... yeah. Who are you?

25:03.970 --> 25:05.269
I'm Penelope.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.570
This is my friend Betty.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.938
-What's your name?
-Jake.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.407
Hi, Jake. We fly
with Captain Gonzo Rogers.

25:10.443 --> 25:13.544
-Have you heard of him?
-Yeah, the, uh, stunt pilot?

25:13.579 --> 25:16.247
[Penelope]
Yeah, he runs a flight school
out of Santa Monica Airport.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.482
His students fly
for the best airlines.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.684
Blue Angels, Thunderbirds,
you name it.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.119
-Whoa.
-We're actually having

25:22.154 --> 25:24.722
an open campus
at the hangar this weekend.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.091
You should come by and say hi.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.292
Betty and I will be there.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.829
The address and time
are on the back.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.864
Thanks, ladies. Bye!

25:33.966 --> 25:35.499
-Thank you, goodbye.
-We're just talking to--

25:35.535 --> 25:36.934
No, you're trying
to steal my students,

25:37.036 --> 25:38.969
I know who you are
and who you work for.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.704
-...., girl, relax.
-Okay, just tell Gonzo

25:40.740 --> 25:41.972
this is really uncool, okay?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.374
I don't go down to Santa Monica

25:43.509 --> 25:44.842
and poach his students, do I?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.010
Get lost.

25:49.815 --> 25:52.116
Jesus, what'd they give you?

25:52.218 --> 25:55.219
Oh my God, this guy spends
a fortune on marketing.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.521
-You know him?
-We used to race together.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.789
Typical macho knucklehead.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.624
Believe me, you don't
wanna learn from this guy.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.326
[phone ringing]

26:02.428 --> 26:04.495
It's the shop, they've been
blowing up my phone all day.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.663
I gotta get back.

26:05.698 --> 26:06.864
Okay, well maybe
this weekend I'll see--

26:06.899 --> 26:08.632
What's the problem?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.068
[upbeat music]

26:23.549 --> 26:25.015
[Penelope]
Jake!

26:25.051 --> 26:26.283
You made it.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.651
-Hey, yeah.
-Let me introduce you

26:27.753 --> 26:28.886
to the captain.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.155
-Captain Rogers?
-Excuse me.

26:33.626 --> 26:37.328
-This is Jake Sherman.
-Jake. Glad to meet you.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.363
Penelope tells me great things.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.798
So you wanna be a pilot, yeah?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.534
Yeah, I'm, you know,
thinking about it.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.735
Oh, come on.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.036
You're doing more
than thinking about it,

26:46.072 --> 26:47.838
you're taking lessons
already, right?

26:47.873 --> 26:50.207
Yeah, with, uh, Tanya Jackson,
do you know her?

26:50.242 --> 26:51.442
Of course.

26:51.544 --> 26:52.509
She's terrific.

26:52.545 --> 26:53.777
Tough as nails, that woman.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.812
What's she been through,
hello?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.413
She and an old
pilot buddy of mine--

26:56.449 --> 26:57.748
and his name was Jake too--

26:57.783 --> 26:59.650
they took a nosedive
into the Rockies, bam!

26:59.685 --> 27:00.818
My friend dies,

27:00.920 --> 27:02.286
Tanya gets medevacked out,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.555
spends a whole month in ICU
drooling all over herself.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.790
Dude, I'm surprised they
renewed her pilot's license,

27:06.892 --> 27:08.559
frankly.

27:08.594 --> 27:11.595
But yeah,
she's one of the best.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.930
I've learned a lot

27:12.965 --> 27:14.231
-from her so far.
-Jake.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.599
Where's the money at
in air travel?

27:15.701 --> 27:16.967
I mean, where's it headed?

27:17.003 --> 27:18.669
Commercial passenger
and freight.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.105
FedEx, UPS, Amazon.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.273
Look. I'll get
right to the point.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.209
Tanya's great
if you wanna learn how to fly

27:25.244 --> 27:27.077
the little crop dusters
on the weekends.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.879
You know, take the family
to the Grand Canyon,

27:28.914 --> 27:30.047
that sort of thing.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.716
But if you wanna learn
to fly the big birds

27:32.852 --> 27:34.118
for major airlines,

27:34.153 --> 27:36.487
if you wanna jockey the F-18s
at the speed of sound...

27:36.522 --> 27:38.322
-You feel me, yeah?
-Yeah.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.191
If you wanna be
Top Gun material,

27:41.227 --> 27:42.893
this is where it's happening.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.929
Got it.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.631
Penelope,
show him the simulator.

27:47.733 --> 27:51.135
-Absolutely.
-Classes start Sunday at 01200.

27:52.571 --> 27:53.904
See you on the flight line,
amigo.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.207
[he sighs]

27:57.243 --> 28:00.077
Gonzo Rogers.
Nice to meet you.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.880
[insects chirring]

28:07.319 --> 28:08.485
[phone vibrating]

28:20.833 --> 28:21.965
[phone vibrating]

28:31.510 --> 28:32.509
Hi, Tanya.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.877
How you doing?

28:33.913 --> 28:35.079
Hey.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.747
I'm, uh, okay.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.718
-Where are you?
-At my friend's place,

28:40.753 --> 28:42.986
in his spare room.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.723
Oh, I hope I'm not
calling too late.

28:45.758 --> 28:46.824
No, that's okay.

28:46.926 --> 28:47.958
He's never around.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.861
What's up?

28:50.963 --> 28:56.133
Nothing, I'm just lying here
thinking about you.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.136
You were?

28:59.171 --> 29:02.840
Yeah, well,
ever since Palm Springs,

29:02.942 --> 29:05.442
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

29:05.478 --> 29:08.178
Mm, you have?

29:08.280 --> 29:14.251
[Tanya]
I know I probably
shouldn't be saying this, but,

29:14.286 --> 29:17.821
I don't know, after going
through the crash and all,

29:17.857 --> 29:20.858
if there's one thing I learned,
it's that life is short,

29:20.893 --> 29:22.793
and if you have feelings
for somebody,

29:22.828 --> 29:25.028
you should tell them.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.931
You're--you're right about that.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.166
Hm.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.138
Um, what are you doing tomorrow?

29:34.173 --> 29:35.506
I have the day off.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.542
You wanna go see a movie?

29:38.611 --> 29:41.845
-I can't.
-Oh. Why not?

29:41.914 --> 29:45.883
[Jake]
Tanya, I went to the open campus
down at Gonzo's hangar.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.285
-You did?
-Yeah, um...

29:48.387 --> 29:50.587
I'm gonna start
taking lessons with him.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.422
-Really?
-I--I think it'll be

29:52.458 --> 29:54.658
good for me,
and Sunday at noon,

29:54.693 --> 29:56.460
he's doing a solo
stunt demonstration

29:56.495 --> 30:00.164
for all the new students,
and I really wanna be there.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.599
-I see.
-I can't afford to take

30:02.635 --> 30:05.769
flying lessons
at two places, so...

30:05.871 --> 30:08.105
I'm gonna have
to drop your class.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.408
-You understand, right?
-No, Jake...

30:11.544 --> 30:13.377
he's not safe,
you don't understand.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.179
I've known the guy for years,

30:15.247 --> 30:17.748
I can't tell you how many times
he's come this close

30:17.850 --> 30:20.350
-to buying the farm.
-Well, I checked his record,

30:20.386 --> 30:22.886
-he's never crashed.
-Oh... and I have,

30:23.022 --> 30:23.954
is that what you mean?

30:23.989 --> 30:25.189
I didn't say that.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.324
Please, don't take this
personally.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.659
How can I not?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.262
I'm...

30:35.134 --> 30:37.801
Jake, please be honest.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.370
Am I--am I coming on too strong?

30:40.406 --> 30:42.172
No.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.007
Not at all.

30:44.043 --> 30:48.679
Because I have this tendency
to be a little aggressive

30:48.714 --> 30:51.882
in situations like this,
and I just...

30:53.853 --> 30:55.652
I don't wanna scare you away.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.689
Look, you're a great instructor
and you've taught me so much,

30:58.724 --> 31:04.795
but I'm... I'm gonna do this.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.164
I'm really sorry.

31:13.806 --> 31:18.742
Well, we--we can still hang out,
right? You and me?

31:18.777 --> 31:20.377
Even though
I'm not your instructor.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.447
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

31:23.515 --> 31:27.317
I mean, if I'm studying
with somebody else, you know,

31:27.353 --> 31:29.753
it could get awkward.

31:35.961 --> 31:40.330
-I, uh, I get it.
-I'll--I'll check in.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.865
Let you know how it's going.

31:45.671 --> 31:46.703
Okay!

31:47.773 --> 31:48.639
Goodnight.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.678
[he groans]

31:58.250 --> 32:00.617
[she weeps]

32:08.961 --> 32:11.428
So, where's Jake this morning?

32:11.497 --> 32:14.064
Um, you remember
his friend Tom?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.999
Yeah. Guy who lives
around the corner.

32:16.035 --> 32:19.536
Yeah. Um, Jake's staying
at his place.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.505
What do you mean,
he's staying at his place?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.106
Why?

32:23.208 --> 32:24.308
What's that look?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.543
I know that look.
What's going on?

32:26.578 --> 32:28.145
We're separated.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.713
When did this happen?

32:29.815 --> 32:31.214
About a week and a half ago.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.382
He thinks I'm cheating on him.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.318
I try calling him
but he doesn't answer.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.719
I don't know
what else to do.

32:35.754 --> 32:36.853
That son of a bitch.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.355
I knew he was a mistake.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.157
Oh, honey, why didn't
you tell me?

32:40.192 --> 32:41.525
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.993
Worry? I'm your mother

32:43.095 --> 32:44.928
and I'm his employer.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.163
I don't believe him.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.597
He's been coming to work
every day

32:47.633 --> 32:49.199
just keeping this secret
from me.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.901
-I'm gonna fire his ass.
-No, Mom, don't!

32:51.036 --> 32:52.402
We need the money.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.037
I've gotta drive
to Santa Barbara next week

32:54.073 --> 32:55.505
and meet with the investors.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.141
How'm I gonna sell them on Jake
if you are getting a divorce?

32:58.177 --> 32:59.543
No, we're not
getting a divorce.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.979
Jake and I will work this out,
I promise.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.715
I love him and I don't
wanna lose him over this.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.017
I told you not to marry him.
Did you listen? No.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.452
[Annie]
Please.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.820
Don't say anything to him.

33:09.955 --> 33:12.389
[she sighs]

33:12.458 --> 33:14.224
You're my baby.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.827
And this jerkwad thinks
he can just break your heart

33:16.862 --> 33:17.995
and walk out on you?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.463
Oh, honey.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.897
Don't you see
what he's doing?

33:20.933 --> 33:22.366
He's the one cheating.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.600
He's having the affair.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.235
That's why he's accusing you
of having one.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.871
I'm gonna get him on the phone.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.806
Forget that,
he'll never answer.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.108
Uh, he's at Tom's?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.976
I know where that is, I'm gonna
drive over there.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.478
-No, don't you dare.
-Someone's gotta pound

33:34.513 --> 33:35.612
some sense into this moron.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.447
No, I just wanted
to talk to you, okay?

33:37.483 --> 33:39.216
I don't want you
in the middle of this.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.283
Please.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.020
All right.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.088
All right, Annie.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.224
Please don't mention this
to him.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.492
I won't.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.626
I promise.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.836
Oh boy.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.773
What the hell's
the matter with you?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.708
Sorry, Margaret,
can't talk right now.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.209
Oh, you're gonna
talk to me, dammit.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.811
Hey!

34:07.846 --> 34:09.913
How dare you accuse my daughter
of having an affair,

34:09.948 --> 34:10.847
you bastard.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.115
Open this door!

34:12.217 --> 34:14.117
Don't you drive away while
I'm talking to you.

34:14.153 --> 34:15.318
Jake!

34:15.387 --> 34:16.887
I am your boss.

34:16.922 --> 34:20.023
If you don't get back here right
now and talk to me, I'm gonna...

34:20.159 --> 34:21.191
Damn him.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.630
[tense music]

34:32.704 --> 34:34.004
Looks great.

34:58.931 --> 34:59.863
All right.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.300
Make sure to get
the full deposit

35:03.335 --> 35:04.734
from everyone today, all right?

35:04.770 --> 35:07.070
I know. I heard you
the first 100 times.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.475
[Gonzo]
Tanya Jackson.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.843
The hell are you doing
down here?

35:12.878 --> 35:14.111
[Tanya]
Hm. I dunno.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.379
Thought I'd talk
to some of your students,

35:16.415 --> 35:17.981
see if they wanted
to drop your class,

35:18.016 --> 35:19.449
train with me.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.750
Don't mind, do you, Gonzo?

35:20.786 --> 35:21.885
Don't mind at all.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.253
Hey, what are you teaching
these days?

35:23.322 --> 35:25.088
Crash landings?

35:25.124 --> 35:26.957
[he chuckles]

35:27.059 --> 35:28.358
Oh...

35:28.393 --> 35:30.560
I'm gonna do a little
stunt demo in a minute.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.562
Maybe you should stick around,
learn how it's done.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.430
I'd love to.

35:33.599 --> 35:33.630
All right,
what a good-looking bunch!

35:38.770 --> 35:41.004
Ladies and gentlemen,
come on in.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.407
Welcome to Flight Academy.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.675
[cheers, applause]

35:45.711 --> 35:47.878
Yeah!

35:47.913 --> 35:49.913
Please allow me to introduce
an old friend of mine.

35:49.948 --> 35:50.814
She's an amazing pilot,

35:50.849 --> 35:52.616
and we used to compete
against each other

35:52.651 --> 35:53.884
at the Reno Air Races.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.685
Give it up for
Ms. Tanya Jackson.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.088
[cheers, applause]

36:00.225 --> 36:01.725
Before we start
the first lesson,

36:01.760 --> 36:04.394
I thought I'd do a little
stunt demo for you guys.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.062
How's that sound?

36:06.098 --> 36:07.297
Yeah.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.698
Now, I don't normally do this,

36:08.734 --> 36:11.568
but it's the first day,
so why not?

36:11.603 --> 36:12.969
Who wants to go for a ride?

36:16.141 --> 36:17.641
Um, Captain...

36:17.676 --> 36:19.442
Uh, how 'bout you, young man?

36:19.478 --> 36:21.244
-What's your name again?
-Jake.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.412
All right, Jake.

36:22.447 --> 36:23.947
Uh, no.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.116
I don't think
that's a good idea.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.617
Really.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.219
Why is that?

36:29.254 --> 36:32.889
Because I--I have seen
your routine, Captain Rogers,

36:32.925 --> 36:35.458
and you're one hell of
a wild man up there.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.227
You got that right,
babycakes.

36:37.262 --> 36:40.530
-Let's do it.
-No, I'm--I'm serious.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.165
You wanna do stunts,
do 'em by yourself.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.401
You've got no business
putting your students at risk.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.937
Spoken from the bully pulpit
of someone who crashed her plane

36:46.972 --> 36:50.407
and killed her copilot,
Captain Jacob Mathews,

36:50.442 --> 36:52.509
one of the best there ever was.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.944
Can't be a lecture
on flight safety

36:53.979 --> 36:55.545
from the likes of you.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.713
Come on.

36:57.749 --> 36:58.815
Jake!

36:58.850 --> 37:00.083
Don't get on that plane.

37:01.086 --> 37:02.953
I'll be okay.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.322
[tense music]

37:07.659 --> 37:08.825
[Margaret]
Jake!

37:10.028 --> 37:11.194
Oh boy.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.364
That's my mother-in-law.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.700
You should probably take
somebody else.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.401
[Penelope]
Captain, Tanya's right.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.337
You can't do stunts
with the students.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.572
We're not insured for it.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.140
Fine.

37:25.844 --> 37:26.876
Sorry, folks!

37:26.912 --> 37:28.712
No passengers this time.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.280
[group laments]

37:30.315 --> 37:31.815
Watch and learn,

37:31.850 --> 37:33.316
Miss Crash-and-Burn.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.654
[Jake]
It's Sunday.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.855
This is not interfering
with work.

37:38.890 --> 37:42.192
Well, I thought you said you
weren't gonna do this anymore.

37:42.227 --> 37:44.027
I'm gonna go watch the demo.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.200
[Gonzo]
Flight safety.
Tanya, gimme a break.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.002
In front of the students,
come on.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.183
[propeller rumbles]

38:12.257 --> 38:13.723
Woo-hoo-hoo!

38:13.759 --> 38:15.358
Ha-ha-ha!

38:15.394 --> 38:17.227
[applause]

38:34.646 --> 38:37.347
[cheers, applause]

38:37.382 --> 38:39.015
[Margaret]
Excuse me.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.551
You are breaking Annie's heart,
do you realize that?

38:41.586 --> 38:43.086
She's got a new boyfriend.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.587
-She's fine.
-No she doesn't.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.556
She told me
she's not seeing anybody.

38:46.591 --> 38:48.425
[cheers, applause]

38:54.266 --> 38:55.732
God, I love bein' me.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.001
Woo!

38:58.036 --> 39:00.470
Look, I'm not gonna have this
conversation with you right now.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.172
And what goes on
with me and Annie

39:02.207 --> 39:03.206
is none of your business.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.742
Yes it is my business.

39:05.777 --> 39:06.776
She's my daughter,

39:06.812 --> 39:08.945
and I'm not gonna let you
destroy her marriage.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.047
It's my marriage too,
last I checked.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.549
[Margaret scoffs]

39:12.584 --> 39:14.551
Don't get smart with me.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.953
[engine stutters]

39:19.091 --> 39:21.424
[Gonzo]
What's going on?
C'mon, baby.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.860
[engine cuts out]

39:23.895 --> 39:25.862
I know exactly
what you're doing.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.664
-What am I doing?
-You're accusing my daughter

39:27.699 --> 39:30.900
of having an affair to cover up
the fact that you're having one.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.235
Who is it?

39:32.270 --> 39:33.603
Is it her?

39:33.638 --> 39:35.872
-Is he sleeping with you?
-Margaret, stop.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.274
I don't like you very much,
Jake, you wanna know why?

39:38.310 --> 39:39.843
-Oh, do tell.
-Because you've got

39:39.878 --> 39:42.178
the mental capacity
of a doughnut.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.647
But for some reason,
my daughter's in love with you.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.583
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
stand back

39:46.618 --> 39:47.851
and watch you ruin her life.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.688
[cheers, applause]

39:53.658 --> 39:55.125
-[engine stuttering]
-Gah!

40:00.632 --> 40:01.598
Come on, Gonzo.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.966
Come on, Gonzo!

40:03.001 --> 40:05.802
[Margaret]
Well. You're gonna wipe
that ADD grin off your face,

40:05.837 --> 40:09.973
go home, apologize to Annie,
and fix your marriage right now.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.876
And forget all this
airplane flying nonsense.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.144
Do you hear me?

40:19.551 --> 40:21.184
Holy crap!

40:21.219 --> 40:24.120
You wanna take flying lessons
from this guy?

40:24.156 --> 40:26.556
Oh, honey, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.594
-[frantic clicking]
-No!

40:34.266 --> 40:36.232
[he screams]

40:36.268 --> 40:38.334
Ma'am... I can assure you.

40:38.370 --> 40:42.005
Statistically, flying is
a lot safer than driving a car.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.339
[he screams]

40:43.375 --> 40:45.442
Here at Captain Rogers'
Flight Academy...

40:45.477 --> 40:46.910
[he screams]

40:46.945 --> 40:49.312
safety is our number one
priority.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.281
[trailing scream,
clattering thud]

40:51.316 --> 40:54.384
[gasps, murmurs, exclamations]

41:01.359 --> 41:03.593
[Tanya]
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Jake.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.229
Oh. Thanks.

41:08.934 --> 41:09.966
Hey.

41:11.803 --> 41:12.836
Hey!

41:13.905 --> 41:15.338
Can I get a hug?

41:18.777 --> 41:21.044
Mm. I haven't heard
from you in a while.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.712
-How you been?
-All right, just...

41:22.747 --> 41:24.280
been working.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.616
I, um, I heard they shut down
Gonzo's school.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.650
Yeah.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.386
I guess you were right
about him.

41:32.724 --> 41:36.259
Are--are you and Annie
back together?

41:36.294 --> 41:39.295
I'm still staying
at my friend's place.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.431
You--you wanna go
grab a coffee?

41:41.466 --> 41:42.765
I can't.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.604
But, um, come here.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.411
[Tanya]
I was hoping you'd call me
to sign up for private lessons.

41:55.447 --> 41:57.680
Mango, pineapple, or mandarin?

41:57.716 --> 42:00.750
Uh... pineapple?

42:00.785 --> 42:02.785
I wanted to, but after
what happened with Gonzo,

42:02.821 --> 42:04.487
my mother-in-law freaked.

42:04.523 --> 42:05.989
Oh, yeah, I saw.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.892
No, it got worse
when Annie found out.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.160
I can't fly anymore.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.429
What do you mean?
You have to fly.

42:13.465 --> 42:15.131
I mean, it doesn't matter
what anybody says.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.267
Flying's what you were
born to do, am I right?

42:18.970 --> 42:21.538
No, I think 20 percent
discount's more fair.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.973
Well, there's no way I'm gonna
pay for your full price

42:24.009 --> 42:25.341
when your deliveries are late.

42:25.377 --> 42:27.043
[Tanya]
Okay, listen.

42:27.078 --> 42:30.446
I'll teach you after work
or on your day off, no charge.

42:30.482 --> 42:31.714
It won't cost
anything but time

42:31.750 --> 42:33.683
and nobody has to know.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.184
-You'd do that?
-Yeah,

42:35.220 --> 42:36.819
and I will behave myself.

42:36.855 --> 42:41.057
There... there won't be
another Palm Springs.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.792
Unless, of course,
it's your idea.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.060
Tanya...

42:44.930 --> 42:46.095
Yeah, that's all right.

42:46.131 --> 42:47.297
[footsteps approaching]

42:47.332 --> 42:49.866
Yeah, okay, yeah, I'll get back
to you as soon as I know.

42:51.903 --> 42:52.869
Hi.

42:55.707 --> 42:58.408
-Hi.
-Um, Margaret,

42:58.443 --> 43:00.143
this is my friend Tanya.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.979
Tanya, this is
my mother-in-law Margaret.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.214
Have we met?

43:05.250 --> 43:06.950
No, I don't think so.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.788
So, um...

43:11.823 --> 43:13.323
I'll, uh, I'll see you later.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.291
Okay.

43:17.162 --> 43:18.828
Thanks for coming by.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.900
Is that your girlfriend?

43:24.769 --> 43:26.002
Hey, I'm talking to you.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.670
No, she's not my girlfriend.

43:27.706 --> 43:30.740
-I don't believe you.
-Believe what you want.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.176
The only reason
I haven't fired you yet

43:33.211 --> 43:35.411
is because Annie
begged me not to.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.051
[mellow music]

44:04.909 --> 44:06.009
[sighs]

44:08.580 --> 44:10.813
-Tanya Jackson.
-Yeah?

44:12.851 --> 44:14.684
Margaret!

44:14.719 --> 44:17.920
Hello again.
How did you find me?

44:17.956 --> 44:20.590
I recognized you from
that plane crash demonstration.

44:20.625 --> 44:21.824
Found your picture online.

44:21.860 --> 44:25.294
Oh, uh... what can I do for you?

44:25.330 --> 44:27.230
You could stay away
from my son-in-law.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.132
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.867
[Margaret]
Oh, I think you do.

44:30.902 --> 44:33.069
He's married.
He works for me.

44:33.104 --> 44:35.138
He doesn't have time
to go running around town

44:35.173 --> 44:36.606
pretending he's
some sort of pilot.

44:36.641 --> 44:38.675
Okay, I told Jake
that I could train him

44:38.710 --> 44:40.476
after his work hours,
if that helps.

44:40.512 --> 44:43.346
Oh, I'm sure you'd love to go
flying late at night with him.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.114
With all due respect,
there's nothing romantic

44:45.150 --> 44:46.616
going on between me and Jake.

44:46.651 --> 44:48.685
I find that hard to believe.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.387
Look, I'm gonna make this
simple for you, sweetie.

44:51.423 --> 44:53.523
Either you stay away
from my son-in-law

44:53.558 --> 44:55.625
or I'm gonna tell the people
that run this place

44:55.660 --> 44:57.093
that you sleep
with your students.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.728
See how they like that.

44:58.763 --> 45:01.030
No more innocent visits
to his place of employment,

45:01.066 --> 45:02.465
and no more flying lessons,

45:02.500 --> 45:04.233
and if he tries
to enroll in this school,

45:04.269 --> 45:06.269
you just reject
his application.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.271
Okay, yeah, I'm not
gonna argue with you.

45:08.306 --> 45:09.105
Good.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.040
But you know why
I care about Jake?

45:11.076 --> 45:13.509
Actually, I am not
the least bit interested!

45:13.545 --> 45:15.211
He was born to be a pilot.

45:15.246 --> 45:17.113
He is good at it
and he loves it.

45:17.148 --> 45:19.115
-Really, is that so?
-And when I meet someone

45:19.150 --> 45:20.783
who has that kind of talent
for flying,

45:20.819 --> 45:22.118
which is
my entire life's work...

45:22.153 --> 45:23.986
Okay, I didn't come here
for chit-chat.

45:24.022 --> 45:26.489
You and I have an understanding,
that's it.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.791
I gotta go,
I got a long drive ahead of me.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.927
-Where are you headed?
-What do you care?

45:30.962 --> 45:33.529
I... I don't know,
maybe I can give you a ride.

45:33.565 --> 45:36.566
-What, in that thing?
-Yeah, where are you going?

45:36.601 --> 45:38.034
Santa Barbara.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.836
Okay, I can get you there
in 30 minutes,

45:39.871 --> 45:41.204
save you a two-hour drive.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.438
Huh.

45:42.474 --> 45:43.806
How much?

45:43.842 --> 45:45.408
Usually it's $200 an hour,

45:45.443 --> 45:46.709
but for a member

45:46.745 --> 45:49.712
of Jake's family,
it's on the house.

45:49.748 --> 45:51.447
-Really?
-Yeah.

45:51.483 --> 45:53.416
Consider it a peace offering.

45:53.451 --> 45:55.885
I'm a businesswoman,
Ms. Jackson,

45:55.920 --> 45:58.020
and I know a good deal
when I see one.

46:00.658 --> 46:01.657
[chuckles]

46:01.693 --> 46:03.626
[plane rumbling]

46:03.661 --> 46:05.161
[Tanya]
And see, here,

46:05.196 --> 46:07.363
I'm adjusting the trim,
which is really just like

46:07.398 --> 46:09.065
a poor man's autopilot.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.135
Kind of makes the flight
smooth or not smooth.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.302
That's... that's it.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.937
The rest is pretty
straightforward.

46:14.973 --> 46:16.405
Okay, that's a lot to remember.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.441
Jake could never memorize
all that.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.076
Jake's actually
a really good pilot.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.110
Jake?

46:21.146 --> 46:22.178
[laughing]

46:22.213 --> 46:23.780
Please. He's three tacos short

46:23.815 --> 46:25.181
of a combo plate.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.118
[Tanya]
Can I ask you a question?

46:29.154 --> 46:31.254
Why do you have such a low
opinion of your son-in-law?

46:31.289 --> 46:32.555
Because he's an idiot.

46:32.590 --> 46:34.323
He's lazy, unmotivated.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.126
My daughter's beautiful.

46:37.162 --> 46:39.562
She's incredible,
and she could've had

46:39.597 --> 46:42.598
any man she wanted,
doctor, lawyer, anybody.

46:42.634 --> 46:45.768
Instead she falls
for this worthless jerk,

46:45.804 --> 46:48.271
this Jake fricking Sherman.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.706
I wanted so much more for her.

46:50.742 --> 46:52.275
I worked my whole life,

46:52.310 --> 46:54.443
built up a business
alongside her dad, for what?

46:54.479 --> 46:56.379
To leave it to her
and this--this Jake?

46:56.414 --> 46:57.747
This loser?

46:57.782 --> 47:00.750
And if you think
that that bed stain

47:00.785 --> 47:03.886
masquerading as my son-in-law
has the chops to be a pilot,

47:03.922 --> 47:05.388
you're not only deluding
yourself,

47:05.423 --> 47:07.023
you're as stupid as he is.

47:07.058 --> 47:08.891
No wonder you crashed
your plane.

47:08.927 --> 47:09.959
[music intensifying]

47:09.994 --> 47:10.993
[screaming]

47:11.029 --> 47:12.495
What the hell are you doing?

47:12.530 --> 47:14.597
[intense music]

47:14.632 --> 47:16.499
[Margaret screaming]

47:16.534 --> 47:18.000
Oh, God, no!

47:18.036 --> 47:20.269
[Margaret screaming]

47:41.993 --> 47:44.360
[phone ringing]

47:44.395 --> 47:45.361
[sighs]

47:47.198 --> 47:48.698
-Hello?
-Hi, am I speaking

47:48.733 --> 47:49.765
with Annie Sherman?

47:49.801 --> 47:51.467
-Uh, yes, who is this?
-This is

47:51.502 --> 47:53.269
the Los Angeles County
Coroner's Office.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.838
Just confirming, your mother
is Margaret Harris, correct?

47:55.874 --> 47:58.374
-Uh, what happened?
-I'm sorry to tell you this,

47:58.409 --> 48:01.844
but your mother passed away
tonight at roughly 8:38 p.m.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.146
What? How?

48:04.182 --> 48:06.315
[male speaker]
It looks like
she committed suicide.

48:06.351 --> 48:08.985
Her body was found at the base
of the Palm Vista Bank building

48:09.020 --> 48:10.586
in downtown Los Angeles.

48:10.622 --> 48:12.788
What do you mean,
she committed suicide?

48:12.824 --> 48:14.557
[male speaker]
That's what the police
are telling us.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.759
Apparently a lot of people
jump off this building.

48:16.794 --> 48:18.794
I'm sorry.
Her car was parked

48:18.830 --> 48:20.563
a few blocks away,
keys in the ignition.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.865
We're assuming you want to
retrieve the vehicle, correct?

48:22.901 --> 48:23.866
[soft music]

48:23.902 --> 48:25.735
Ms. Sherman, are you there?

48:26.838 --> 48:28.371
[Pastor]
Dear family and friends,

48:28.406 --> 48:30.106
we gather today to celebrate

48:30.141 --> 48:31.941
the life of Margaret Harris,

48:31.976 --> 48:35.611
beloved wife, mother,
and friend to the community.

48:35.647 --> 48:37.847
Her time on Earth
was a blessing to us all,

48:37.882 --> 48:39.482
and she will be missed.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.451
It doesn't make sense.

48:43.554 --> 48:44.987
I mean, she had her problems,

48:45.023 --> 48:47.757
but... she wasn't depressed.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.926
-She was miserable.
-Don't say that.

48:49.961 --> 48:51.961
-She wasn't miserable.
-She was.

48:51.996 --> 48:53.329
She was mean to everybody.

48:53.364 --> 48:55.164
Me, people at the shop.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.800
The only person
she was ever nice to was you.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.739
What about the business?

49:03.775 --> 49:05.408
I mean, you and I own it now,

49:05.443 --> 49:07.610
and somebody needs to be there
to run it full time.

49:07.645 --> 49:08.978
I say we sell it.

49:09.013 --> 49:10.746
I don't know about that,
it's a money-maker.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.148
Do you want to make
lighting fixtures

49:12.183 --> 49:13.316
for the rest of your life?

49:13.351 --> 49:14.817
-No.
-Well, I've done it

49:14.852 --> 49:17.053
for the past year
and I'm not doing it anymore.

49:17.088 --> 49:20.356
We're gonna sell the place,
and I'm gonna fly airplanes.

49:21.225 --> 49:23.626
What's gotten into you?

49:23.661 --> 49:25.761
You never used
to talk like this.

49:25.797 --> 49:27.029
Is that a problem?

49:27.765 --> 49:29.031
I kinda like it.

49:31.636 --> 49:32.735
I miss you.

49:34.005 --> 49:35.538
I didn't do
what you said I did.

49:35.573 --> 49:38.107
Can we not talk about this,
please?

49:38.142 --> 49:40.142
I just want you
to come back home.

49:42.013 --> 49:43.012
[sobbing]

49:49.954 --> 49:51.721
[Tanya]
Yeah, but you can't
go back to her.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.289
She's a mess, I have to.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.224
No, you don't.
Come on, man.

49:55.259 --> 49:57.193
-She's playing you.
-What do you mean?

49:57.228 --> 49:59.128
You told me she's not attracted
to you anymore.

49:59.163 --> 50:03.332
That's, you know, part of being
in a long-term relationship.

50:04.202 --> 50:05.835
She cheated on you,

50:05.870 --> 50:07.737
and you saw her, right?

50:07.772 --> 50:10.606
It was a one-time thing,
and she swears she didn't do it,

50:10.641 --> 50:12.975
so I don't really even know
if what I saw was her

50:13.011 --> 50:14.276
or if it could've been...

50:14.312 --> 50:15.745
-What about her mom?
-What about her?

50:15.780 --> 50:17.413
Well, when Margaret
would treat you like dirt,

50:17.448 --> 50:18.781
did Annie ever defend you

50:18.816 --> 50:20.583
or tell her mom
to shut the hell up?

50:20.618 --> 50:22.551
No! In fact,
Annie agreed with her.

50:22.587 --> 50:23.853
You told me she did.

50:23.888 --> 50:26.055
Yeah, well,
she's made some mistakes.

50:26.090 --> 50:28.724
Will you stop making excuses
for her?

50:28.760 --> 50:30.659
Give yourself some credit.

50:30.695 --> 50:32.728
I don't know if it's
all the years of abuse

50:32.764 --> 50:34.897
that you've endured
from your mother-in-law or what,

50:34.932 --> 50:39.969
but, I mean, you've no idea
how wonderful you are.

50:40.872 --> 50:43.205
You know, you work hard,

50:43.241 --> 50:45.641
you're always trying
to do right by other people.

50:47.178 --> 50:48.277
You're handsome.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.915
And you're one hell of a pilot.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.551
God, I know this is
gonna sound really silly, but...

50:57.522 --> 51:00.222
You remind me of what life
was like before the crash.

51:01.893 --> 51:04.093
Annie doesn't know
what she needs.

51:05.763 --> 51:09.065
But I know I need you.

51:09.801 --> 51:10.733
I married her.

51:11.936 --> 51:13.636
I made a commitment,

51:13.671 --> 51:16.305
and I can't just quit
at the first sign of trouble.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.340
I still want to take
flying lessons with you,

51:18.376 --> 51:20.643
but I'm gonna go back
to my wife.

51:20.678 --> 51:23.245
-It's the right thing to do.
-It wasn't a one-time thing.

51:24.348 --> 51:25.281
What?

51:27.418 --> 51:29.218
She's still cheating on you.

51:30.354 --> 51:31.754
I took some aerial photos.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.022
I know that I shouldn't have,

51:33.057 --> 51:34.857
but I was worried about you, so.

51:34.892 --> 51:35.858
[tense music]

51:35.893 --> 51:37.660
That's your backyard, right?

51:37.695 --> 51:38.694
Right.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.231
[Tanya]
And that's Annie.

51:49.841 --> 51:51.107
When did you take these?

51:52.043 --> 51:53.175
[Tanya]
Last week.

51:53.211 --> 51:54.710
[mouse clicking]

51:56.280 --> 51:58.714
She likes getting massaged
under the sun.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.217
And she...

52:02.720 --> 52:03.886
likes to do...

52:04.822 --> 52:05.821
other things...

52:06.891 --> 52:08.691
under the sun as well.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.432
[sighs]

52:18.402 --> 52:19.602
I'm sorry.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.141
You wanna go fly an airplane?

52:27.478 --> 52:28.544
Yeah.

52:31.048 --> 52:32.648
[engine whirring]

52:32.683 --> 52:35.217
Okay, give me
a 45-degree turn to the right.

52:35.253 --> 52:37.186
And remember,
turn to the right

52:37.221 --> 52:38.754
while you're descending,
there's no...

52:38.789 --> 52:41.557
No rudder on the turns,
only to initiate the turns.

52:41.592 --> 52:44.727
Good, exactly. Why?

52:44.762 --> 52:46.929
Because when you do that,
it offsets adverse yaw.

52:46.964 --> 52:49.565
Yeah, you're doin' great!

52:49.600 --> 52:51.367
You're not just sayin' that?

52:51.402 --> 52:53.402
No, I'm not just sayin' that!

52:53.437 --> 52:55.137
Come on, you're a pilot, man.

52:55.173 --> 52:56.705
You're doin' it.

52:56.741 --> 52:59.074
[gentle music]

53:01.646 --> 53:02.711
[seatbelt clicks]

53:09.887 --> 53:10.953
Careful.

53:21.265 --> 53:23.766
Uh... what are you doin'?

53:23.801 --> 53:25.434
[laughing]

53:25.469 --> 53:29.238
I'm maybe... giving you...

53:30.208 --> 53:31.640
a chance...

53:32.743 --> 53:34.743
at revenge.

53:38.316 --> 53:40.783
Um, I don't think you should...

53:40.818 --> 53:43.118
[tense music]

54:04.108 --> 54:05.741
[plane roaring]

54:11.482 --> 54:13.449
Houston, we have a problem.

54:34.705 --> 54:36.171
[moaning]

54:36.207 --> 54:38.307
[soft music]

54:44.081 --> 54:46.115
[laughing]

54:53.424 --> 54:56.091
[moaning]

55:13.044 --> 55:15.511
After you sell the business,
what are you gonna do?

55:17.682 --> 55:20.683
Think I'm gonna buy an airplane.

55:20.718 --> 55:24.486
I saw an ad online
for a 1947 Cessna.

55:24.522 --> 55:26.989
-Price of a used car.
-Really?

55:29.794 --> 55:32.261
I was thinking about
going back to Mexico.

55:32.296 --> 55:34.530
We could borrow
my friend's Gulfstream.

55:36.567 --> 55:37.866
Baja.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.134
Mexico City.

55:39.804 --> 55:41.103
Cozumel.

55:41.839 --> 55:42.971
Cool.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.445
-We should do it.
-We will.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.481
No, I mean... now.

55:52.516 --> 55:53.682
Like, tomorrow.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.051
Are you serious?

55:56.721 --> 55:57.820
Yeah!

55:57.855 --> 55:59.421
Okay, why not?

55:59.457 --> 56:00.923
Really, you will?

56:14.438 --> 56:16.638
[birdsong]

56:33.357 --> 56:34.490
[doorbell ringing]

56:34.525 --> 56:36.225
[Lindsey]
Hi, Annie, how ya doin'?

56:36.260 --> 56:37.726
Hey, Lindsey.

56:37.762 --> 56:39.128
Wait, where are you?

56:39.163 --> 56:41.063
[Lindsey]
I'm at the mall, I'm not home.

56:41.098 --> 56:42.831
I'm looking at you
through my doorbell camera.

56:42.867 --> 56:45.267
-Do you see it there?
-Oh, I didn't even notice.

56:45.302 --> 56:46.635
[Lindsey]
That's the whole point.

56:46.670 --> 56:48.270
I kept getting packages
stolen off my porch,

56:48.305 --> 56:49.905
so I figured
I'd get one of these.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.273
Very cool.

56:51.308 --> 56:53.275
[Lindsey]
I am so sorry about your mom.

56:53.310 --> 56:54.810
How are you holding up?

56:54.845 --> 56:57.346
Oh, I'm... I'm okay.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.014
Hey, listen, I, um,

56:59.049 --> 57:01.150
I got a letter
addressed to you in my mailbox.

57:01.185 --> 57:02.618
The mail lady must've made
a mistake.

57:02.653 --> 57:04.253
[Lindsey]
Oh, just put it in the mailbox.

57:04.288 --> 57:06.221
I'll be home in 30 minutes.
I'll grab it then.

57:06.257 --> 57:07.856
Thanks, hon,
I really appreciate it.

57:07.892 --> 57:08.957
No problem.

57:10.161 --> 57:12.027
[mellow music]

57:21.472 --> 57:22.838
[chiming]

57:22.873 --> 57:24.239
[Lindsey]
What's up?

57:24.275 --> 57:26.842
Hey, Lindsey,
sorry to bother you again, um...

57:28.512 --> 57:30.245
I have a favor to ask.

57:32.483 --> 57:34.016
[Lindsey]
So, you're in luck.

57:34.051 --> 57:36.318
My husband is amazing
with computers and cameras.

57:36.353 --> 57:37.753
He disabled the motion sensor,

57:37.788 --> 57:39.855
so it sees everything
all the time.

57:39.890 --> 57:41.423
I don't understand.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.958
It's not important.

57:42.993 --> 57:44.793
Good news is,
this video's been recording

57:44.829 --> 57:47.262
for, I don't know,
a month, longer?

57:47.298 --> 57:48.363
Oh, okay, cool.

57:48.399 --> 57:50.399
So whatever you're looking for,
it should be on there.

57:50.434 --> 57:52.134
-I gotta run.
-Okay, thank you.

57:52.169 --> 57:54.069
I will bring it to you
when I'm done, okay?

57:54.104 --> 57:55.671
Call me, let me know
what you find.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.139
I am so curious.

57:57.174 --> 57:59.374
This is, like,
one of those detective shows.

57:59.410 --> 58:01.710
CSI, whatever, I love those!

58:01.745 --> 58:03.545
Thank you again,
I'll see you soon.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.149
Okay.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.150
[tense music]

58:08.185 --> 58:09.117
[exhales]

58:58.102 --> 58:59.701
[engine starting]

59:21.559 --> 59:22.524
[clicking]

59:47.685 --> 59:50.852
[doorbell ringing]

59:52.289 --> 59:55.490
Um, yeah, uh, is that your car?

59:55.526 --> 59:58.226
Yeah. Something wrong?

59:58.262 --> 1:00:00.596
You were in my driveway
a couple weeks ago, weren't you?

1:00:00.631 --> 1:00:02.731
I'm sorry, who are you?

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:03.932
I'm Annie.

1:00:05.502 --> 1:00:08.870
Look, um, this is my house
and this is your car,

1:00:08.906 --> 1:00:11.239
and I'm pretty sure
that's you with some guy.

1:00:12.710 --> 1:00:14.776
Who are you and what
were you doing there?

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.981
Oh, man, they didn't get
permission, did they?

1:00:19.016 --> 1:00:21.783
-Who's they?
-You know, the photographers.

1:00:21.819 --> 1:00:24.119
Oh, I knew something was fishy
when they paid me in cash.

1:00:24.154 --> 1:00:25.554
[Annie]
What? What are you
talking about?

1:00:25.589 --> 1:00:28.290
[Daniella]
Look, I'm just the model.
If you wanna get mad about them

1:00:28.325 --> 1:00:30.425
shooting on your property,
you'll have to talk to the cops.

1:00:30.461 --> 1:00:33.228
No, wait, look. My husband saw
you and he thought you were me.

1:00:33.263 --> 1:00:36.131
He left me because he thought
I was kissing some guy.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:38.200
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

1:00:39.003 --> 1:00:40.035
Please?

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:41.370
Please!

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:51.546
[Daniella]
A few weeks ago,
I submitted my pictures

1:00:51.582 --> 1:00:53.515
for this modeling gig.

1:00:53.550 --> 1:00:56.885
They called me in and...
I mean, it was a little weird

1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:58.854
because it was just me
and this producer.

1:00:58.889 --> 1:01:00.322
Um, nice lady.

1:01:00.357 --> 1:01:02.257
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you too.

1:01:02.292 --> 1:01:04.126
Here. You brought some photos?

1:01:04.161 --> 1:01:05.927
So did you get a name?

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:09.564
Um, Susan, I think? Suzette?

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.134
Anyway, um, they said
that they just needed

1:01:12.169 --> 1:01:15.070
a shot of a girl and a guy
making out next to a car

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:17.873
wearing this hat and some
clothes that they gave me.

1:01:17.908 --> 1:01:20.676
Anyway, it was a one-day gig
and they paid me in cash.

1:01:21.578 --> 1:01:22.744
So I did it.

1:01:22.780 --> 1:01:25.313
-So why my house?
-I don't know.

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:26.815
They just gave me that address

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:29.685
and said, "Go there,
kiss this guy."

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:34.356
About a week later,
they asked us to do it again,

1:01:34.391 --> 1:01:36.391
but this time
it was in the backyard

1:01:36.427 --> 1:01:38.527
and it was a little sexier.

1:01:38.562 --> 1:01:40.028
Lots of coconut oil.

1:01:42.166 --> 1:01:43.799
Like, it got in my hair,
it was...

1:01:43.834 --> 1:01:46.101
-Just so weird.
-Why?

1:01:46.136 --> 1:01:48.370
I mean, I watched hours
of video footage

1:01:48.405 --> 1:01:49.738
from my neighbor's
doorbell camera,

1:01:49.773 --> 1:01:52.274
and I never saw
any photographers

1:01:52.309 --> 1:01:54.376
or camera crew, nothing.

1:01:54.411 --> 1:01:57.045
Oh, it's because they weren't
shooting us from the ground.

1:01:57.081 --> 1:01:58.680
They were shooting us
from an airplane.

1:01:59.850 --> 1:02:01.383
An airplane?

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:03.051
[Daniella]
The audition was
at a flight school,

1:02:03.087 --> 1:02:05.954
so my guess is it was just
some promotional thing.

1:02:05.989 --> 1:02:07.522
See, this is why
I need an agent,

1:02:07.558 --> 1:02:09.791
because there are just so many
creeps out there with cameras

1:02:09.827 --> 1:02:12.027
who think they can just take
advantage of people like me.

1:02:27.144 --> 1:02:28.376
[chimes]

1:02:33.283 --> 1:02:35.150
[shower running]

1:02:36.386 --> 1:02:39.621
[phone vibrating]

1:03:03.714 --> 1:03:05.413

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:10.986

1:03:17.027 --> 1:03:18.226
[chimes]

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:32.541
[Jake]
All right, we'll be ready to go
in a couple minutes.

1:03:32.576 --> 1:03:34.810
So I'm just gonna throw
some stuff in a suitcase,

1:03:34.845 --> 1:03:36.678
grab my passport,
and then we can go.

1:03:36.713 --> 1:03:40.282
Oh, um, actually, I, uh...

1:03:40.317 --> 1:03:42.551
I have a couple of errands
I have to run first.

1:03:42.586 --> 1:03:45.420
-I'll come with you.
-No, no, no, that's all right.

1:03:45.455 --> 1:03:48.390
Um... how about I meet you
at the airport?

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:50.125
Say, uh... three?

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:52.294
[tense music]

1:03:52.329 --> 1:03:53.829
All right, whatever.

1:03:53.864 --> 1:03:54.930
Okay, yeah.

1:03:58.802 --> 1:04:00.135
[Jake groans]

1:04:45.716 --> 1:04:47.315
[doorbell ringing]

1:05:01.932 --> 1:05:02.998
Jake?

1:05:08.305 --> 1:05:09.237
Jake?

1:05:12.442 --> 1:05:13.508
Jake?

1:05:19.016 --> 1:05:21.816
[muffled screaming, grunting]

1:05:21.852 --> 1:05:23.718
[intense music]

1:05:34.031 --> 1:05:35.096
[muffled screaming]

1:05:35.966 --> 1:05:37.699

1:06:21.445 --> 1:06:23.878

1:07:00.617 --> 1:07:01.649
[Jake]
Tanya!

1:07:05.589 --> 1:07:06.621
Hey! Oh...

1:07:07.557 --> 1:07:08.757
[Tanya laughs]

1:07:08.792 --> 1:07:10.925
Hi, what...
what are you doing here?

1:07:10.961 --> 1:07:12.994
What do you mean?
We're leaving at three, right?

1:07:13.030 --> 1:07:16.097
Well, yeah, but it's only noon.
You're... you're early.

1:07:16.133 --> 1:07:18.333
I know, I thought
I'd check out the Gulfstream,

1:07:18.368 --> 1:07:19.968
you know, surprise you.

1:07:20.003 --> 1:07:22.003
Maybe we could take off
a little bit before three.

1:07:23.106 --> 1:07:24.806
Yeah, no, I'd love to,

1:07:24.841 --> 1:07:27.742
but I... I, uh,
I gotta make a drop first.

1:07:27.778 --> 1:07:29.344
[Jake]
Yeah, that's cool,
I'll come with you.

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:30.979
I mean, I'm packed,
you're packed, right?

1:07:32.783 --> 1:07:35.383
Yeah, yeah, sure, okay, why not?

1:07:35.419 --> 1:07:36.918
Exactly! Why not?

1:07:36.953 --> 1:07:38.286
[laughing]

1:07:38.321 --> 1:07:40.055
Uh, what's in the--the box?

1:07:40.090 --> 1:07:41.189
[knocking]

1:07:41.224 --> 1:07:42.757
[Tanya]
It's just, uh...

1:07:42.793 --> 1:07:44.392
The main office asked me

1:07:44.428 --> 1:07:46.327
to make a delivery
on the way to town,

1:07:46.363 --> 1:07:48.096
so I figured I'd put it
in the Gulfstream.

1:07:48.131 --> 1:07:49.631
Come on, now, tell me the truth.

1:07:49.666 --> 1:07:50.932
[tense music]

1:07:50.967 --> 1:07:53.001
-I am.
-No, you're not.

1:07:53.036 --> 1:07:54.569
You're lying to me, aren't you?

1:07:56.440 --> 1:07:58.139
Why do you think
I'm lying to you?

1:07:58.175 --> 1:08:03.111
Because you said the same thing
when we went to Palm Springs!

1:08:03.146 --> 1:08:05.346
Remember? You said you
had to make a delivery.

1:08:06.016 --> 1:08:08.817
[laughing]

1:08:10.954 --> 1:08:13.888
Right, okay, yeah, well,
I'm telling the truth this time.

1:08:13.924 --> 1:08:16.057
I mean, I'd never know
with you, right?

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:18.326
[Tanya]
Right.

1:08:18.361 --> 1:08:20.161
-Here let me help you.
-No, no, it's okay.

1:08:20.197 --> 1:08:21.930
No, no, really,
I got it, I got it.

1:08:32.742 --> 1:08:34.642
[plane whirring]

1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:39.681
[Tanya moaning]

1:08:41.318 --> 1:08:43.685
[tense music]

1:08:44.721 --> 1:08:46.921

1:09:14.684 --> 1:09:15.717
[groans]

1:09:18.855 --> 1:09:21.222
[Jake]
So, tell me,
what's in the box anyway?

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.225
It's, um...

1:09:25.262 --> 1:09:26.394
Fish food.

1:09:27.931 --> 1:09:29.063
Fish food?

1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:32.834
Yeah. Pellets.

1:09:32.869 --> 1:09:36.471
They're these...
little tracking devices.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:39.841
Marine biologists at UCLA
ask us to drop 'em

1:09:39.876 --> 1:09:42.443
every six months or so,
and then dolphins and whales

1:09:42.479 --> 1:09:45.747
eat 'em and they can track
their migration patterns.

1:09:45.782 --> 1:09:48.750
Wow, I, uh...
never heard of that.

1:09:52.055 --> 1:09:53.988
-Can I see what they look like?
-No, no!

1:09:54.024 --> 1:09:56.224
You... you can't open the box.

1:09:56.259 --> 1:09:58.326
Why not?

1:09:58.361 --> 1:10:00.295
Because they smell
and they're greasy,

1:10:00.330 --> 1:10:01.930
and, you know,
it's my buddy's plane,

1:10:01.965 --> 1:10:03.531
so I gotta keep it clean
for him.

1:10:05.435 --> 1:10:09.170
So, you're just gonna...
dump that box into the ocean?

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.573
Yeah.

1:10:12.909 --> 1:10:14.209
You, uh, wanna help me?

1:10:15.412 --> 1:10:16.878
Uh... sure.

1:10:18.248 --> 1:10:19.314
[chuckles]

1:10:19.349 --> 1:10:20.882
Okay, great.

1:10:20.917 --> 1:10:23.585
I'm just gonna bring her down
a bit and reduce speed.

1:10:34.064 --> 1:10:35.697
Okay, we're good to go.

[Tanya]
Yeah, it's incredible, right?

1:10:52.949 --> 1:10:54.415
Go ahead, push it out the door.

[groaning]

1:11:06.263 --> 1:11:07.695
Damn, girl, it's heavy!

1:11:07.731 --> 1:11:09.397
Yeah, well, you know,
those fish are hungry.

1:11:09.432 --> 1:11:11.299
-Especially the sharks.
-Really?

1:11:11.334 --> 1:11:12.867
A lot of sharks in the area?

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:14.569
-Yeah, hundreds of 'em.
-No kidding!

1:11:14.604 --> 1:11:16.604
[Tanya]
Yeah, and I hear
they love a free meal.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.273
You're probably right
about that!

1:11:21.578 --> 1:11:22.877
Go ahead, push it out!

1:11:26.483 --> 1:11:28.916
Hurry, I can't maintain
this altitude for long.

1:11:29.886 --> 1:11:30.852
Okay.

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:42.630
I... I don't know.

1:11:42.666 --> 1:11:45.667
Well, you know how I feel
about people who litter, right?

1:11:46.736 --> 1:11:47.702
I mean...

1:11:47.737 --> 1:11:49.337
why don't I just open the box

1:11:49.372 --> 1:11:50.805
and dump out the pellets?

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:53.074
It's okay, just...
just push out the damn box.

1:11:53.109 --> 1:11:54.275
We do it all the time.

1:11:54.311 --> 1:11:55.743

1:12:48.331 --> 1:12:49.330
Where are we?

Jake, Jake, please,
please don't be mad.

1:12:58.274 --> 1:13:00.007
-Where's the key to this?
-I threw it away.

1:13:00.043 --> 1:13:01.442
Listen, listen,
she doesn't love you.

1:13:01.478 --> 1:13:03.211
She thinks you're too stupid
to be a pilot.

1:13:03.246 --> 1:13:05.446
You told me she said that.
She's just like her mother.

1:13:05.482 --> 1:13:07.815
She needs to go away,
just like her mother.

1:13:07.851 --> 1:13:10.151
Holy crap, you killed Margaret?

1:13:10.186 --> 1:13:12.754
No, no, I liberated you
from Margaret!

1:13:12.789 --> 1:13:15.556
Come on, don't you see?
You're so much happier now.

1:13:15.592 --> 1:13:17.658
You don't have to work
at that terrible job anymore.

1:13:17.694 --> 1:13:18.860
You're gonna be a pilot.

1:13:18.895 --> 1:13:20.328
You're gonna inherit
a ton of money.

1:13:20.363 --> 1:13:22.363
You can live the life
that you've always wanted to.

1:13:22.399 --> 1:13:24.732
Oh my God, I'm so much better
for you than she is.

1:13:24.768 --> 1:13:26.667
She's just a dead weight
in your life.

1:13:26.703 --> 1:13:29.170
Come on, let's just push
this box out the door.

1:13:29.205 --> 1:13:31.639
Okay, then we'll forget
that any of this ever happened.

1:13:31.674 --> 1:13:34.308
Okay?
You and I will be together.

1:13:34.344 --> 1:13:36.043
It'll be all right.
We're gonna be okay.
