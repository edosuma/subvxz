00:01.223 --> 00:03.636
Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.

00:03.638 --> 00:08.370
Time is moving faster at this
end of the ship than the other.

00:08.372 --> 00:09.972
How much longer, Doctor?

00:10.972 --> 00:14.052
To survive, they are
what we must all become.

00:14.052 --> 00:15.652
Please tell me you didn't?

00:16.692 --> 00:19.652
I have been so looking
forward to meeting you.

00:19.652 --> 00:23.252
I waited for you.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.571
Everyone, under their beds, now!

01:20.572 --> 01:21.421
Again?

01:21.562 --> 01:24.162
Alit, get under your bed...
and stay there!

01:41.522 --> 01:43.801
It's the scarecrows. New ones.

01:43.802 --> 01:46.321
It's OK. We'll be OK.

01:46.322 --> 01:47.681
Save your ammo!

01:47.682 --> 01:49.042
Wait for it!

01:49.042 --> 01:50.122
Fire!

03:35.168 --> 03:38.645
_

03:39.362 --> 03:40.842
How many times have you died?

03:42.402 --> 03:44.441
How many different ways?

03:44.442 --> 03:45.602
Have you burned?

03:46.722 --> 03:48.282
I know you've fallen.

03:51.162 --> 03:53.082
Have you ever drowned?

03:55.802 --> 03:58.081
Have you felt the blade?

03:58.082 --> 04:03.001
I suppose what we're really
asking, my dear, is...

04:03.002 --> 04:04.482
Well...

04:08.322 --> 04:09.802
Any requests?

04:50.602 --> 04:53.602
So, I imagine you're the
next one along, then?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.481
I think so.

04:56.482 --> 05:00.041
I'm a bit hazy on the whole
regeneration thing, I'm afraid.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.241
You mean, I'm going
to turn into a woman,

05:02.242 --> 05:04.481
and you don't even
remember it happening?

05:04.482 --> 05:05.761
Oh!

05:05.762 --> 05:08.201
- Am I a woman now?
- Well, kind of, yeah.

05:08.202 --> 05:09.481
Hold me!

05:09.482 --> 05:11.321
- Kiss me!
- Make me!

05:11.322 --> 05:13.761
Do you two want to be alone?

05:13.762 --> 05:16.641
Which, in your case, would mean
more than it usually does.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.921
Ugh, Grandad's back.

05:18.922 --> 05:23.441
We've been debating the
best way to kill you.

05:23.442 --> 05:24.921
Where's Bill?

05:24.922 --> 05:26.881
Well, we thought we might
chuck you off the roof,

05:26.882 --> 05:30.481
but I wasn't sure how many
regenerations you had left.

05:30.482 --> 05:32.921
Yeah, we could have been up and
down the stairs all night!

05:32.922 --> 05:34.921
We could shoot you... but
that's a bit vanilla.

05:34.922 --> 05:38.001
- But old school, nice for a change.
- For a change.

05:38.002 --> 05:39.921
I said, where is Bill?

05:39.922 --> 05:42.241
Well, if we told you that,

05:42.242 --> 05:46.081
I'm afraid you'd be
really, really upset.

05:46.082 --> 05:48.241
So...

05:48.242 --> 05:51.122
She's right behind you!

05:52.322 --> 05:54.201
Look, there's Bill.

05:54.202 --> 05:57.161
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder

05:57.162 --> 05:59.041
and squeezed into a Cyberman,

05:59.042 --> 06:03.441
doomed to spend an eternal afterlife
as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie...

06:03.442 --> 06:06.001
it was hilarious.

06:06.002 --> 06:09.681
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.

06:09.682 --> 06:11.441
You missed her by two hours!

06:11.442 --> 06:12.921
Ripped out her heart,

06:12.922 --> 06:15.082
threw it in to a bin,
and burned it all away.

06:16.842 --> 06:18.601
He's internalising.

06:18.602 --> 06:21.081
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.

06:21.082 --> 06:25.561
The last time I saw you, you
were on your way to Gallifrey.

06:25.562 --> 06:28.801
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?

06:28.802 --> 06:31.561
So they cured your little
condition and kicked you out.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.482
It was a mutual kicking me out.

06:35.082 --> 06:37.561
Somehow you ended up in this dump.

06:37.562 --> 06:39.241
You never could drive.

06:39.242 --> 06:40.881
You wouldn't understand.

06:40.882 --> 06:42.441
Well, let's see how I do.

06:42.442 --> 06:44.281
Your TARDIS got stuck,

06:44.282 --> 06:46.601
you killed a lot of people,
took over the city,

06:46.602 --> 06:50.561
lived like a king until they
rebelled against your cruelty,

06:50.562 --> 06:53.201
and ever since then
you've been hiding out,

06:53.202 --> 06:54.681
probably in disguise,

06:54.682 --> 06:57.202
because everybody knows
your stupid round face.

06:59.402 --> 07:00.441
Round?!

07:00.442 --> 07:02.801
- It's a little bit.
- Shut up!

07:02.802 --> 07:05.161
Do you want to see my city, Doctor?

07:05.162 --> 07:06.521
Do you want to see what happens

07:06.522 --> 07:11.161
when you're too late to save your
little friend and everybody else?

07:11.162 --> 07:12.601
See?

07:12.602 --> 07:16.201
This used to be just a hospital...
now it's mass production.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.841
The Cyber Foundries.

07:17.842 --> 07:22.481
The whole city is a machine
to turn people into Cybermen.

07:22.482 --> 07:25.321
What do you think? Exciting, isn't it?

07:25.322 --> 07:27.761
Watching the Cybermen getting started.

07:27.762 --> 07:29.161
They always get started.

07:29.162 --> 07:31.201
They happen everywhere there's people...

07:31.202 --> 07:36.401
Mondas, Telos, Earth,
Planet 14, Marinus.

07:36.402 --> 07:40.201
Like sewage and smartphones
and Donald Trump...

07:40.202 --> 07:41.961
some things are just inevitable.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.201
Doctor...

07:43.202 --> 07:45.201
Doctor, have you done something?

07:45.202 --> 07:46.241
What's happening?

07:46.242 --> 07:47.641
People get the Cybermen wrong...

07:47.642 --> 07:50.121
there's no evil plan, no evil genius.

07:50.122 --> 07:51.802
Just parallel evolution.

07:53.242 --> 07:55.441
Doctor, what have you done?

07:55.442 --> 07:58.601
People plus technology minus humanity.

07:58.602 --> 08:01.161
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.

08:01.162 --> 08:04.321
Always read the comments, because
one day they'll be an army.

08:04.322 --> 08:06.201
Look!

08:06.202 --> 08:07.922
They're coming!

08:09.722 --> 08:11.361
They're coming for us!

08:11.362 --> 08:13.201
This doesn't make any sense!

08:13.202 --> 08:14.321
Doesn't it?

08:14.322 --> 08:16.841
These Cybermen are primitive...

08:16.842 --> 08:19.601
they're programmed to track human
beings and convert them...

08:19.602 --> 08:22.001
they home in on human life signs only.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.361
You two, you should know by now.

08:23.362 --> 08:25.361
When you're winning,
and I'm in the room,

08:25.362 --> 08:26.721
you're missing something.

08:26.722 --> 08:28.681
What have we missed??

08:28.682 --> 08:30.962
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.

08:33.322 --> 08:34.881
I was waiting for my chance.

08:36.562 --> 08:37.801
Computer,

08:37.802 --> 08:40.640
containing the algorithm
defining human life signs...

08:40.642 --> 08:42.760
I only had time to change one detail.

08:42.761 --> 08:45.801
A single number. One to a two.

08:45.802 --> 08:47.682
One heart to two hearts.

08:50.642 --> 08:53.882
I expanded the definition of humanity.

08:55.042 --> 08:58.281
Took 'em a while to update the net...
but here we go!

08:58.282 --> 08:59.842
Welcome to the menu.

09:11.642 --> 09:13.241
Now they think that
we count as humans...

09:13.242 --> 09:15.242
and they're going to
fix that in a hurry!

09:22.082 --> 09:24.521
There must be other ways up here...
we can't cover them all!

09:24.522 --> 09:26.441
You can't fight a whole city.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.081
You know the stories...

09:28.082 --> 09:31.402
there's only ever been one way
to stop that many Cybermen.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.242
Me!

09:38.522 --> 09:40.841
Then do it... stop them!

09:40.842 --> 09:43.241
Begging for your life already?
That's a new record.

09:43.242 --> 09:45.841
I'm not begging you. I'd
rather die than beg you!

09:45.842 --> 09:47.801
- Lucky day, then.
- I can do this.

09:47.802 --> 09:49.841
They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.

09:49.842 --> 09:51.002
Knock yourself out.

09:53.962 --> 09:55.202
Your wish is my command.

09:56.322 --> 09:59.241
I was secretly on your side
all along, you silly sausage.

09:59.242 --> 10:00.681
Is that true?

10:00.682 --> 10:02.122
Don't spoil the moment.

10:03.682 --> 10:06.002
Seriously, I need to know. Is that true?

10:07.322 --> 10:08.802
It's hard to say, I...

10:10.882 --> 10:12.121
I'm in two minds.

10:12.122 --> 10:14.362
Fortunately, the other
one's unconscious.

10:23.282 --> 10:24.721
Nardole, have you been useful?

10:24.722 --> 10:27.322
Yeah. Found
this in the loading bay.

10:37.642 --> 10:38.722
Shuttle craft.

10:45.202 --> 10:46.442
Get junior up there.

10:49.802 --> 10:51.121
Ooh, you hit me really hard.

10:51.122 --> 10:54.202
You're telling me... I think
I've still got the bump!

10:56.042 --> 10:57.441
Right. First things first...

10:57.442 --> 10:58.482
Agh!

11:21.242 --> 11:22.322
Bill?

11:26.762 --> 11:29.401
What was that, Doctor?
You'll only slow us down?

11:29.402 --> 11:31.922
Yeah, I think you're right.

11:43.922 --> 11:45.401
The Doctor's dead.

11:45.402 --> 11:48.001
He told me he'd always hated you.
Let's go.

11:48.002 --> 11:49.201
No.

11:49.202 --> 11:50.441
The Doctor's dead.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.161
He told me he'd always hated you.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.641
Yeah, I heard you the first time!

11:53.642 --> 11:55.361
- Oh, tedious!
- Oi!

11:55.362 --> 11:56.881
Look, we need to get away from here,

11:56.882 --> 11:58.401
find a hole in the roof... or make one.

11:58.402 --> 12:00.722
Is there a great big gun on the front?
That would be good.

12:01.962 --> 12:04.481
I don't think we're going anywhere.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.162
Bill's back!

12:18.322 --> 12:19.922
Bill.

12:21.122 --> 12:22.282
I will fix this.

12:23.322 --> 12:26.122
I will get you back again, I swear.

12:32.802 --> 12:33.842
What level are we on?

12:35.322 --> 12:38.801
Must be one of the solar farms.

12:38.802 --> 12:41.441
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.

12:41.442 --> 12:43.041
Who are you?

12:43.042 --> 12:46.761
That's the last floor we can
bust through... engine's blown.

12:46.762 --> 12:48.401
Hello, little girl.

12:48.402 --> 12:50.481
We're from downstairs, and, er...

12:50.482 --> 12:52.362
I think we're going to need your help.

13:42.762 --> 13:45.321
Sorry you have to stay out here.

13:45.322 --> 13:47.642
You'd frighten the children.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.801
Where am I?

13:50.802 --> 13:52.122
How did I...?

13:53.602 --> 13:54.961
Sorry, I...

13:54.962 --> 13:56.281
I can't remember...

13:56.282 --> 13:58.281
The Doctor put you to
sleep, you needed rest.

13:58.282 --> 13:59.762
What am I doing in a barn?

14:01.002 --> 14:02.241
What's wrong?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.322
Sorry, it's just...

14:06.442 --> 14:07.601
Sorry, what?

14:07.602 --> 14:11.281
The Doctor has explained that
you're not dangerous, but...

14:11.282 --> 14:13.161
it's difficult.

14:13.162 --> 14:15.921
What's difficult?

14:15.922 --> 14:18.161
Where is the Doctor? I need to...

14:18.162 --> 14:20.281
His injuries are being tended to.

14:20.282 --> 14:21.322
Injuries?!

14:23.122 --> 14:25.201
I want to see the Doctor!
I need to speak to him.

14:36.282 --> 14:37.642
Hello?

14:41.602 --> 14:42.642
Hello.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.681
Everyone's too scared to talk to you...

14:46.682 --> 14:48.162
but I'm not.

14:49.282 --> 14:50.682
Why are they scared?

14:53.642 --> 14:56.001
Come on, you lot,
put your backs into it.

14:56.002 --> 14:57.561
Remember the Alamo!

14:57.562 --> 14:58.801
Oh, maybe not.

14:58.802 --> 15:01.521
Nardole, you're working them too hard.

15:01.522 --> 15:03.521
This isn't work, it's war.

15:03.522 --> 15:04.681
Operation Exodus.

15:04.682 --> 15:06.882
They're looking for fresh
meat, and you're it.

15:12.602 --> 15:13.922
Is that it?

15:19.482 --> 15:21.362
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.

15:22.402 --> 15:23.602
I know.

15:59.122 --> 16:02.842
That... is not... me.

16:03.842 --> 16:04.961
I'm sorry.

16:04.962 --> 16:07.881
I am Bill Potts.

16:07.882 --> 16:08.921
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

16:08.922 --> 16:10.641
I am Bill Potts!

16:10.642 --> 16:11.922
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:13.082 --> 16:14.681
Hello, Bill Potts.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.081
Doc... tor.

16:16.082 --> 16:18.681
I'm sorry. I gave her a mirror.

16:18.682 --> 16:20.881
Oh, no, don't be sorry.

16:20.882 --> 16:22.721
You were being kind.

16:22.722 --> 16:24.842
Nothing wrong with kind. Jelly baby?

16:25.842 --> 16:26.921
Thank you.

16:26.922 --> 16:28.841
You're welcome.

16:28.842 --> 16:30.682
- Bye.
- Toodle-oo.

16:47.962 --> 16:50.081
What was that? In the mirror?

16:50.082 --> 16:51.442
Er...

16:54.442 --> 16:55.841
A Cyberman.

16:55.842 --> 16:58.001
What's a Cyberman?

16:58.002 --> 17:00.961
A technologically augmented human being,

17:00.962 --> 17:03.321
designed to survive in
a hostile environment.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.681
Perfectly sound idea...

17:04.682 --> 17:06.800
unfortunately all they want to do

17:06.801 --> 17:09.601
is to turn everyone
else into Cybermen too.

17:09.602 --> 17:10.922
They go viral.

17:11.962 --> 17:13.002
Why?

17:14.281 --> 17:17.080
They consider themselves to be
an improvement, an upgrade.

17:17.082 --> 17:18.321
No.

17:19.682 --> 17:22.041
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?

17:40.722 --> 17:41.841
What do you remember?

17:41.842 --> 17:44.441
There's quite a lot! You know?

17:44.442 --> 17:46.481
I was down there for ten years.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.641
And then, one day...

17:48.642 --> 17:50.961
they took you to the conversion theatre.

17:50.962 --> 17:52.922
- Do you remember that?
- No.

17:55.122 --> 17:57.161
Bits of it...

17:57.162 --> 17:58.802
You turned up.

18:00.202 --> 18:02.322
Do you remember what they did to you?

18:04.122 --> 18:05.162
Nothing.

18:06.642 --> 18:07.682
Look at me. I'm fine.

18:12.202 --> 18:13.442
I'm fine!

18:29.082 --> 18:31.962
You are... so strong.

18:33.122 --> 18:34.522
You're amazing.

18:35.722 --> 18:39.681
Your mind has rebelled
against the programming.

18:39.682 --> 18:42.601
It's built a wall around itself...
a castle made of you...

18:42.602 --> 18:44.521
and you're standing on the battlements,

18:44.522 --> 18:46.761
saying, "No! No, not me."

18:46.762 --> 18:48.761
What are you talking about?

18:48.762 --> 18:51.121
All that time, living under the Monks...

18:51.122 --> 18:54.361
you learned to hang on to yourself.

18:54.362 --> 18:57.962
But I'm... I'm fine, look at me!

19:01.202 --> 19:02.562
Bill...

19:04.082 --> 19:05.602
...what you see is not you.

19:07.362 --> 19:09.641
Your mind is acting like
a perception filter.

19:09.642 --> 19:13.281
You still see yourself
as you used to be.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.401
Used to be?

19:15.402 --> 19:18.802
- It won't last forever...
- What do you mean, used to be?!

19:23.802 --> 19:26.881
Bill, I'm sorry, but you
can't be angry any more.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.545
A temper is a luxury
you can no longer...

19:28.547 --> 19:29.341
Why can't I?

19:30.802 --> 19:32.841
Why can't I be angry?!

19:32.842 --> 19:34.521
Bill... please!

19:34.522 --> 19:38.722
You left me alone for ten years,
don't tell me I can't be angry!

19:47.162 --> 19:49.481
Because of that.

19:49.482 --> 19:50.922
That's why.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.682
Because you're a Cyberman.

19:57.442 --> 20:00.521
Right, everyone, back to work.

20:00.522 --> 20:04.762
Nothing to see here, somebody
broke the barn, no biggie.

20:06.562 --> 20:09.361
Come on, defences don't
build themselves.

20:09.362 --> 20:12.362
It's OK, they're just frightened.

20:13.682 --> 20:17.362
People are always going to be
afraid of me, aren't they?

20:18.522 --> 20:19.722
Aren't they?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.241
What is that? Engine oil?

20:37.242 --> 20:38.602
No. It's an actual tear...

20:39.962 --> 20:41.681
...but it shouldn't be.

20:41.682 --> 20:42.842
Doctor!

20:44.442 --> 20:47.481
Right, while you've been
here chatting up Robo-Mop,

20:47.482 --> 20:50.481
me and... me have been busy.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.561
We've found it.

20:52.562 --> 20:54.921
Oh, hello, my dear.

20:54.922 --> 20:59.322
My God, you were so boring
for all those years...

21:00.642 --> 21:05.681
...but it was worth every day of it...

21:05.682 --> 21:06.801
for this!

21:06.802 --> 21:09.241
Bill, don't let him upset you.

21:09.242 --> 21:11.201
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?

21:11.202 --> 21:13.522
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.
Any tips?

21:14.522 --> 21:18.561
Or, maybe... I dunno, old bras?

21:18.562 --> 21:21.481
I am not upset.

21:21.482 --> 21:24.841
Oh. Well, doesn't that take
all the fun out of cruelty?

21:24.842 --> 21:27.162
Might as well rile a fridge!
Come on, this way!

21:39.322 --> 21:41.641
Why are there so many
children in that house?

21:41.642 --> 21:44.881
Small community, several
hundred at most.

21:44.882 --> 21:47.802
So, they keep the children
together for their protection.

21:49.002 --> 21:51.361
Those things make it up here sometimes,

21:51.362 --> 21:53.481
they try to take the children...

21:55.162 --> 21:57.081
You all right?

21:58.642 --> 21:59.962
Yes, fine.

22:02.202 --> 22:04.081
What was that?

22:04.082 --> 22:05.681
They target the children

22:05.682 --> 22:07.961
because conversion is easier
with a younger donor...

22:07.962 --> 22:09.561
the brains are fresher,

22:09.562 --> 22:13.242
and because the bodies are
smaller, there's less to...

22:15.282 --> 22:16.322
Less to what?

22:17.522 --> 22:19.082
Less to throw away.

22:24.362 --> 22:26.281
You said...

22:26.282 --> 22:29.321
I remember, you said you could fix this.

22:29.322 --> 22:31.162
That you'd get me back.

22:32.482 --> 22:33.641
Did you say that?

22:33.642 --> 22:34.961
I did say that, yes.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.202
- Were you lying?
- No.

22:39.002 --> 22:40.761
Were you right?

22:40.762 --> 22:42.042
No.

22:46.842 --> 22:48.721
Bill?

22:48.722 --> 22:50.801
We're not going to get
out of this one, are we?

22:50.802 --> 22:52.641
Well...

22:52.642 --> 22:54.202
I don't know.

22:55.402 --> 22:57.122
There are always possibilities.

22:58.922 --> 23:00.042
I can feel it.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.042
In my head, the programming.

23:04.682 --> 23:07.362
The Cybermen are taking
me over, piece by piece.

23:09.042 --> 23:11.681
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane,

23:11.682 --> 23:13.481
and I can't hang on forever.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.121
Bill, look, whatever it takes...

23:15.122 --> 23:17.162
No, I want you to know, as my friend...

23:21.162 --> 23:25.362
I don't want to live if
I can't be me any more.

23:27.162 --> 23:29.161
Do you understand?

23:29.162 --> 23:30.442
Yeah.

23:33.322 --> 23:34.922
And that's not possible, is it?

23:37.602 --> 23:39.961
Well, I'll tell you what
else isn't possible.

23:39.962 --> 23:42.241
A Cyberman crying.

23:42.242 --> 23:45.042
Where there's tears, there's hope.

23:46.402 --> 23:47.722
Come on.

23:52.402 --> 23:53.681
Weird.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.601
How you don't remember any of this.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.321
The two of us together puts
the timelines out of sync...

23:58.322 --> 24:01.282
you can't retain your memories,
so I don't have them.

24:03.202 --> 24:06.081
You absolutely had to
bring her, did you?

24:06.082 --> 24:07.801
"Her"?!

24:07.802 --> 24:09.281
It's a Cyberman now.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.801
Yes, sorry.

24:10.802 --> 24:13.641
Becoming a woman's one thing...
but have you got...

24:13.642 --> 24:14.682
empathy?

24:15.722 --> 24:17.161
Where is it?

24:17.162 --> 24:18.682
Lift shaft right here.

24:19.722 --> 24:20.801
Hologram.

24:20.802 --> 24:22.401
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.

24:22.402 --> 24:24.681
It's a wonder more people
don't turn to genocide!

24:24.682 --> 24:26.961
And the doors.

24:26.962 --> 24:29.641
This is how we evacuate the children.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.602
There have to be more
lifts, quite close.

24:33.762 --> 24:36.922
We know Operation Exodus is
ready, we can't hang around here.

24:38.242 --> 24:40.361
What are you doing?!

24:40.362 --> 24:41.721
You just called the lift!

24:41.722 --> 24:43.801
Yeah, well, we're going
to need them, aren't we?

24:43.802 --> 24:45.241
The lift was downstairs...

24:45.242 --> 24:47.242
and quite possibly not empty.

24:49.042 --> 24:51.641
Stand aside.

24:51.642 --> 24:52.801
Do as she says.

24:52.802 --> 24:54.481
Stand aside.

24:54.482 --> 24:56.441
"Do as she says"!

24:56.442 --> 24:58.281
Is the future going to be all girl?

24:58.282 --> 24:59.562
We can only hope.

25:16.842 --> 25:18.281
Fire!

25:18.282 --> 25:20.601
Kill it, kill it, kill it!

25:20.602 --> 25:23.882
Kill it, kill it. Kill it.

25:28.042 --> 25:30.721
Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!

25:30.722 --> 25:33.001
Why's it different? Why
does it look like that?

25:33.002 --> 25:34.281
It evolved.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.601
Exactly. Since we left,

25:35.602 --> 25:39.081
they've built a weapons-grade
version to come after us.

25:39.082 --> 25:42.161
And we just gave our position away.
Well done, the genius twins!

25:42.162 --> 25:44.521
It doesn't matter... we can
still get out of here.

25:44.522 --> 25:47.921
We go take the lift right to the
top and escape in your TARDIS.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.081
We could evacuate the Waltons back
there, if you're feeling ridiculous.

25:51.082 --> 25:52.721
We can't go back to the bridge.

25:52.722 --> 25:55.561
We can only go four or five
floors up at the most.

25:55.562 --> 25:58.121
The further we move up the ship,
the slower time moves for us

25:58.122 --> 26:00.481
and the faster it moves
for the Cybermen.

26:00.482 --> 26:01.881
By the time we get to the bridge,

26:01.882 --> 26:04.641
they'll have had thousands of
years to work out how to stop us.

26:04.642 --> 26:08.121
There is no safe way to
get back to the TARDIS...

26:08.122 --> 26:10.321
it's a mathematical impossibility.

26:10.322 --> 26:13.362
Operation Exodus.
Troops to attack phase.

26:26.122 --> 26:27.722
Nardole, what is that?

26:43.362 --> 26:46.401
- Tell me, what is it?
- Doctor?

26:46.402 --> 26:49.601
The Cybermen don't have fear
but they know how to use it.

26:49.602 --> 26:54.402
Operation Exodus. They're announcing
their arrival, they're coming.

26:56.362 --> 26:58.082
The Cybermen are coming.

27:04.402 --> 27:05.841
How long till they get here?

27:05.842 --> 27:08.321
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.

27:08.322 --> 27:11.002
According to my calculations,
we need a plan, quick.

27:12.482 --> 27:14.921
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?

27:14.922 --> 27:16.921
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.

27:16.922 --> 27:19.282
For a moment there I was
feeling a glimmer of purpose.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.121
But do we have long enough?

27:24.122 --> 27:27.601
They're Cybermen, there's no
such thing as long enough.

27:27.602 --> 27:31.081
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!

27:31.082 --> 27:33.441
We don't have guns that
can shoot through armour.

27:33.442 --> 27:35.442
Look. Give me one of them rifles.

27:44.082 --> 27:47.761
Dearest, I've been thinking.
We need your TARDIS.

27:47.762 --> 27:50.001
We can't go up, but we can go down.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.401
Your TARDIS is right at the
bottom of the ship, isn't it?

27:53.402 --> 27:56.442
- Well, I suppose.
- Is it, or isn't it?

28:03.682 --> 28:04.721
What's that?

28:04.722 --> 28:11.402
We're on a spaceship, remember?
That's a service duct. Rusted shut.

28:12.922 --> 28:15.162
Think you could get angry with it?

28:16.682 --> 28:18.761
Is that windmill important?

28:18.762 --> 28:19.882
Why?

28:26.122 --> 28:27.682
No reason.

28:37.722 --> 28:39.441
See that bush over there?

28:39.442 --> 28:40.842
Shoot it.

28:47.322 --> 28:49.521
Think you're quite something, don't you?

28:49.522 --> 28:52.761
- I try not to miss the obvious.
- How was that possible?

28:52.762 --> 28:55.001
Because this is not the countryside.

28:55.002 --> 28:56.962
This is a spaceship.

28:58.722 --> 29:01.761
- It's my TARDIS!
- Our TARDIS.

29:01.762 --> 29:05.201
And it's right in the middle
of a city full of Cybermen.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.601
- They are all coming here.
- And it doesn't work!

29:07.602 --> 29:08.842
Because?

29:09.842 --> 29:12.961
If it fooled you, it
will fool the Cybermen.

29:12.962 --> 29:16.041
They're robots, but they've
got monkey brains.

29:16.042 --> 29:20.322
You can always fool a monkey brain
with a little bit of theatre.

29:21.402 --> 29:25.521
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.

29:25.522 --> 29:26.761
The black hole?

29:26.762 --> 29:28.561
Too close to the event horizon.

29:28.562 --> 29:31.321
And you screwed up, you went too fast!

29:31.322 --> 29:33.601
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.

29:33.602 --> 29:36.761
Which reminds me, funny
thing happened to me once!

29:36.762 --> 29:38.162
What?

29:40.042 --> 29:44.281
A very long time ago, a very scary
lady threw me against a wall

29:44.282 --> 29:46.081
and made me promise to always,

29:46.082 --> 29:49.602
always carry a spare
dematerialisation circuit.

29:51.162 --> 29:53.921
I don't remember much about her now

29:53.922 --> 29:57.442
but she must have made
quite an impression.

29:59.602 --> 30:03.841
You know you basically
have me to thank for this.

30:03.842 --> 30:05.521
You're welcome.

30:05.522 --> 30:09.361
By the way, is it wrong that I...

30:09.362 --> 30:11.202
Yes! Very.

30:15.482 --> 30:16.961
I don't understand.

30:16.962 --> 30:19.321
Well, it's very simple.

30:19.322 --> 30:25.361
The Cybermen have removed all
fear from their hearts and minds.

30:25.362 --> 30:29.122
But you, Alit, you are
going to put it all back.

31:14.082 --> 31:16.882
I've never met anyone like you.
So where are you from?

31:18.962 --> 31:21.722
I don't know. I was sort of found.

31:22.962 --> 31:24.162
On a doorstep?

31:30.562 --> 31:31.962
Who loved you?

31:37.642 --> 31:42.841
I probably should tell you...
I'm not human.

31:42.842 --> 31:44.642
I'll try anything once.

31:52.042 --> 31:54.802
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!

31:59.922 --> 32:01.162
I'm so sorry.

32:03.042 --> 32:05.042
I... under... stand.

32:15.482 --> 32:18.082
Listen...

32:21.442 --> 32:22.802
I don't suppose...

32:34.842 --> 32:37.721
We have a maximum of ten
minutes before they attack.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.401
Is it time?

32:39.402 --> 32:41.282
- Nardole?
- We're ready.

32:42.722 --> 32:44.161
Is that my gun?

32:44.162 --> 32:46.121
No, no. I don't like guns.

32:46.122 --> 32:48.122
I've got a better idea.

32:50.522 --> 32:52.841
- Are you good at throwing?
- Better than all the boys!

32:52.842 --> 32:58.802
Then how about humanity's first weapon?
Tempting, isn't it?

33:04.322 --> 33:10.081
Listen, me and sis are off now,
but we were kind of wondering,

33:10.082 --> 33:12.121
what's your plan, Doc?

33:12.122 --> 33:14.641
Because whatever you've
got, you can't save them.

33:14.642 --> 33:17.161
There's another solar farm,
five levels above us.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.001
If I can get all the children up
there, and most of the adults...

33:21.002 --> 33:23.481
Then the Cybermen will find them again.

33:23.482 --> 33:25.441
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.

33:25.442 --> 33:28.241
- Do you have a problem with that?
- You can't win.

33:28.242 --> 33:29.282
I know. And?

33:32.642 --> 33:36.122
Come on, Lady Version, I honestly
don't know what you see in him.

33:38.282 --> 33:39.842
Likewise!

33:42.922 --> 33:44.362
No.

33:47.762 --> 33:49.522
No!

33:50.522 --> 33:53.042
When I say no, you
turn back around! Hey!

33:55.002 --> 33:58.281
I'm going to be dead in a few hours,
so before I go, let's have this out.

33:58.282 --> 33:59.922
You and me, once and for all.

34:05.562 --> 34:08.400
Winning? Is that what
you think it's about?

34:08.402 --> 34:10.481
I'm not trying to win.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.121
I'm not doing this because
I want to beat someone,

34:13.121 --> 34:17.841
or because I hate someone, or
because I want to blame someone.

34:17.842 --> 34:21.161
It's not because it's fun and God
knows it's not because it's easy.

34:21.161 --> 34:23.960
It's not even because it works,
because it hardly ever does.

34:23.962 --> 34:28.202
I do what I do, because it's right.
Because it's decent.

34:29.362 --> 34:31.442
And above all, it's kind.

34:33.042 --> 34:34.242
It's just that.

34:40.482 --> 34:41.562
Just kind.

34:44.442 --> 34:49.281
If I run away today,
good people will die.

34:49.282 --> 34:53.161
If I stand and fight,
some of them might live.

34:53.161 --> 34:55.521
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.
Hey, you know,

34:55.522 --> 34:58.121
maybe there's no point
in any of this at all.

34:58.122 --> 35:02.041
But it's the best I can do,
so I'm going to do it.

35:02.042 --> 35:05.321
And I'll stand here doing
it till it kills me.

35:05.322 --> 35:06.722
You're going to die too.

35:08.922 --> 35:10.322
Some day.

35:13.482 --> 35:15.921
How will that be? Have
you thought about it?

35:15.922 --> 35:18.361
What would you die for?

35:18.362 --> 35:21.041
Who I am is where I stand.

35:21.042 --> 35:22.082
And where I stand...

35:27.682 --> 35:29.522
...is where I fall.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.481
Stand with me. These
people are terrified.

35:41.482 --> 35:43.642
Maybe we can help a little.

35:45.042 --> 35:48.802
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?

35:55.362 --> 36:01.602
See this face? Take a
good, long look at it.

36:02.642 --> 36:07.362
This is the face that didn't
listen to a word you just said.

36:21.362 --> 36:24.922
Missy. Missy.

36:28.002 --> 36:29.402
You've changed.

36:30.962 --> 36:34.442
I know you have, and I know
what you're capable of.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.482
Stand with me, it's
all I've ever wanted.

36:44.122 --> 36:45.482
Me too.

36:51.482 --> 36:57.922
But no. Sorry. Just... no.

37:01.202 --> 37:02.642
But thanks for trying.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.401
Hello.

37:26.402 --> 37:31.001
You will not be harmed.
You will be upgraded.

37:31.002 --> 37:32.442
No, thanks.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.322
Alit, let's go!

38:13.922 --> 38:15.121
Do you get it now?

38:15.122 --> 38:19.401
This whole floor, under the soil,
it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.

38:19.402 --> 38:21.601
And if you happen to be a
genius with insane computer

38:21.602 --> 38:24.401
skills you can remote-spark
a critical failure and...

38:24.402 --> 38:26.121
- Boom!
- Boom!

38:26.122 --> 38:28.641
You weren't listening to a
word of that, were you?

38:28.642 --> 38:30.561
No, I'm still not getting it.

38:30.562 --> 38:32.961
Incoming, about 120 feet.

38:32.962 --> 38:36.322
On it. Three! Two! One!

38:40.002 --> 38:41.481
So, any second now,

38:41.482 --> 38:44.561
the Cybermen will decide that
we have significant weaponry.

38:44.562 --> 38:47.562
Awesome weaponry, the
ultimate apple upgrade.

38:48.802 --> 38:51.721
Which means that they will change
their campaign parameters.

38:51.722 --> 38:52.922
How's that?

38:56.122 --> 38:58.252
Up till now this has
been a mercy mission.

38:58.254 --> 38:58.962
A what?

38:58.963 --> 39:02.801
They want to upgrade you.
That's why they're

39:02.802 --> 39:06.041
coming for your children... but now
they think we're a military target.

39:06.042 --> 39:08.921
They'll fall back, regroup, and
plan a much bigger assault.

39:08.922 --> 39:10.281
Oh, good-oh!

39:10.282 --> 39:12.081
Yes, good. Because they'll stop

39:12.082 --> 39:14.321
tracking the children, which means...

39:14.322 --> 39:15.442
They're moving back!

39:16.962 --> 39:18.242
Time to go.

39:19.322 --> 39:21.081
But we're surrounded!

39:21.082 --> 39:24.561
I love being surrounded. It
means everyone's looking at me.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.841
Hazran, let's get going.

39:26.842 --> 39:30.521
Right, then, come on, you lot,
everybody down to the cellar!

39:30.522 --> 39:33.402
Nardole, I want you to
lead the evacuation.

39:33.404 --> 39:34.362
What? No.

39:34.363 --> 39:36.641
There's another solar farm on floor 502,

39:36.642 --> 39:39.001
there should be enough
livestock in the cryogene...

39:39.002 --> 39:40.682
You need me with you!

39:46.122 --> 39:48.841
Thanks for all the software,
I'll take it from here.

39:48.842 --> 39:51.841
Sir, with respect, I'm
worried about your plan.

39:51.842 --> 39:53.361
Plan, what plan?

39:53.362 --> 39:56.121
I think as soon as this place
is evacuated, you're going

39:56.122 --> 39:58.601
to blow the whole floor, killing
as many Cybermen as you can.

39:58.602 --> 40:01.441
No, course not. I won't
do that until I've left.

40:01.442 --> 40:04.801
- Liar, it can't be done remotely.
- You couldn't do it remotely.

40:04.802 --> 40:06.121
Neither could you.

40:06.122 --> 40:07.961
And more to the point
you are not sending me

40:07.962 --> 40:10.921
up there to babysit a
load of smelly humans.

40:10.922 --> 40:14.481
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's
exactly what I'm doing.

40:14.482 --> 40:16.201
This is me we're talking about.

40:16.202 --> 40:18.561
Me. You know what I was like.

40:18.562 --> 40:21.961
If there's more than three people
in a room, I start a black market.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.041
Send me with them,

40:23.042 --> 40:25.561
I'll be selling their own spaceship
back to them once a week.

40:25.562 --> 40:29.401
Please, I would rather stay
down here and explode.

40:29.402 --> 40:31.881
- You go and farm the humans.
- Listen.

40:31.882 --> 40:36.641
One of us has to stay down here and
blow up a lot of silly tin men,

40:36.642 --> 40:40.041
and one of has to go up there and
look after a lot of very scared

40:40.042 --> 40:45.481
people, day after day, for the rest
of their lives, and keep them safe.

40:45.482 --> 40:49.882
Now the question is this, Nardole,
which one of us is stronger?

40:59.362 --> 41:00.962
Damn.

41:09.722 --> 41:11.002
My condolences.

41:13.162 --> 41:16.921
I'm going to name a town after you.
A really rubbish one.

41:16.922 --> 41:19.002
- I'm counting on it.
- And probably a pig.

41:20.442 --> 41:22.161
Young lady, you're coming with me.

41:22.162 --> 41:25.602
No arguments... may I remind you I am
still empowered to kick your arse.

41:26.802 --> 41:29.241
You'd have to go back down to
that hospital and find it, then.

41:29.242 --> 41:30.641
Look, Bill...

41:30.642 --> 41:33.682
My arse got kicked a long time
ago, and there's no going back.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.281
All I've got left is
returning the favour.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.681
Oh, great. She's allowed to explode.

41:44.682 --> 41:48.442
- You sure?
- You know I am.

41:53.442 --> 41:55.321
I don't know what to say.

41:55.322 --> 41:57.282
You'll think of the right words later.

42:01.802 --> 42:02.922
Doctor.

42:05.002 --> 42:06.442
Bill.

42:12.842 --> 42:15.362
You're wrong, you know? Quite wrong.

42:16.562 --> 42:18.442
I never will be able to find the words.

42:27.282 --> 42:28.641
Right, everyone,

42:28.642 --> 42:31.081
I need you to be big, I
need you to be brave

42:31.082 --> 42:32.442
and I need you to follow me.

42:47.042 --> 42:49.481
Right, come on, then, hop in.
Straight down.

42:49.482 --> 42:51.122
Come here.

42:53.522 --> 42:54.802
I'm sorry?

42:57.602 --> 42:58.922
Come here, I said.

43:01.002 --> 43:04.682
Seriously? Are we really
going to do this?

43:14.642 --> 43:17.682
I loved being you. Every second of it.

43:19.362 --> 43:21.522
Oh, the way you burn. Like a sun.

43:22.882 --> 43:24.962
Like a whole screaming world on fire.

43:27.042 --> 43:31.402
I remember that feeling,
and I always will.

43:35.802 --> 43:37.362
And I will always miss it.

43:44.482 --> 43:50.242
Now that was really very nicely done.

43:52.002 --> 43:53.042
Thank you.

44:05.042 --> 44:07.522
It's good to know I
haven't lost my touch.

44:09.402 --> 44:10.442
You deserve my best.

44:22.242 --> 44:24.641
Oh, they love to advertise.

44:24.642 --> 44:28.081
We have to keep them away from
the house till everyone's clear.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.961
We've got to buy them time.

44:29.962 --> 44:33.562
All right, back there?
Hazran, keep them moving.

44:37.602 --> 44:40.001
They'll attack on both sides.
I'll take the back, yeah?

44:40.002 --> 44:41.441
Yeah.

44:41.442 --> 44:44.761
This is it, I'm afraid.

44:44.762 --> 44:49.401
So, if there's anything
we ought to be saying...

44:49.402 --> 44:53.602
I can't think of anything, can you?

44:58.802 --> 45:00.241
No.

45:00.242 --> 45:01.761
But, hey...

45:01.762 --> 45:05.641
you know how I'm usually all about women

45:05.642 --> 45:08.682
and kind of people my own age.

45:10.602 --> 45:12.561
Yeah?

45:12.562 --> 45:14.202
Glad you knew that!

45:26.202 --> 45:30.362
Without hope. Without witness.

45:32.922 --> 45:33.962
Without reward.

45:40.602 --> 45:43.121
- How long do I have?
- Oh, I was precise.

45:43.122 --> 45:44.961
You'll be able to make
it back to your TARDIS,

45:44.962 --> 45:47.842
maybe even get a cuppa, though
it might leak a little.

45:48.922 --> 45:53.002
And then regenerate... into you.

45:54.122 --> 45:56.321
Welcome to the sisterhood.

45:56.322 --> 46:00.682
Missy, seriously, why?

46:01.842 --> 46:07.081
Oh, because he's right. Because
it's time to stand with him.

46:07.082 --> 46:09.321
It's where we've always been going,

46:09.322 --> 46:10.922
and it's happening now, today.

46:12.082 --> 46:14.042
It's time to stand with the Doctor.

46:16.042 --> 46:18.602
No. Never.

46:21.442 --> 46:25.761
Missy! I will never
stand with the Doctor!

46:25.762 --> 46:28.002
Yes, my dear, you will.

46:36.962 --> 46:41.721
Don't bother trying to regenerate,
you got the full blast.

46:52.002 --> 46:57.561
You see, Missy. THIS is where
we've always been going.

46:57.562 --> 47:03.962
This is our perfect ending. We
shoot ourselves in the back.

47:42.802 --> 47:45.681
OK, to the lifts... floor 502.

47:45.682 --> 47:48.841
Squeeze as many in as you
can, we only get one trip.

47:48.842 --> 47:50.682
They'll take years to get back here.

48:08.202 --> 48:10.802
Telos! Sealed you into your ice tombs!

48:13.482 --> 48:14.842
Voga!

48:20.522 --> 48:21.802
Canary Wharf!

48:26.962 --> 48:28.642
Planet 14!

48:30.002 --> 48:33.802
Every single time, you lose!

48:34.882 --> 48:36.522
Even on the Moon!

48:45.762 --> 48:49.722
Hello. I'm the Doctor.

48:51.162 --> 48:53.722
Doctors... are... not... required.

49:04.402 --> 49:09.162
I'm not a doctor. I am <i>the</i> Doctor.

49:12.042 --> 49:14.082
The original, you might say.

49:41.122 --> 49:47.202
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.

49:49.322 --> 49:50.762
Time enough.

50:12.122 --> 50:15.162
Pity. No stars.

50:20.362 --> 50:22.042
I hoped there'd be stars.

50:54.602 --> 50:57.362
They still might come, your friends.

50:59.602 --> 51:02.402
No. No, I don't think so.

51:03.522 --> 51:04.961
What about the Cybermen?

51:04.962 --> 51:06.761
Well, the Doctor's
destroyed most of them

51:06.762 --> 51:11.441
so it will take them a while to
regroup, before they find us again.

51:11.442 --> 51:13.441
And then what?

51:13.442 --> 51:15.681
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.

51:15.682 --> 51:18.682
Nardole, Alit! Hazran
says the food's ready.

51:20.842 --> 51:22.922
Right. Come on. Let's
go and find the others.

51:25.442 --> 51:28.041
- You know Hazran?
- Yes.

51:28.042 --> 51:29.162
I think she likes you.

51:30.962 --> 51:32.522
She's only human.

53:01.002 --> 53:02.601
Promise you won't go?

53:02.602 --> 53:03.842
Promise.

53:19.242 --> 53:20.882
Am I dead?

53:32.202 --> 53:33.562
Does that feel dead to you?

53:39.042 --> 53:42.522
You're like me now. It's just
a different kind of living.

53:44.122 --> 53:45.682
How did you find me?

53:47.322 --> 53:49.082
I left you my tears, remember?

53:56.922 --> 53:58.281
I don't think they're mine.

53:58.282 --> 54:01.762
I know when you're crying them.
Time to go.

54:04.522 --> 54:07.201
But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.

54:07.202 --> 54:10.482
Of course we can't. And
we're not going to.

54:23.962 --> 54:26.522
I suppose this is the only
place he'd rest in peace.

54:33.682 --> 54:35.642
If there's any place he'd do that.

54:46.202 --> 54:47.961
How can you fly the TARDIS?

54:47.962 --> 54:51.041
I'm the pilot. I can fly anything!

54:51.042 --> 54:52.402
Even you!

54:56.242 --> 54:58.362
So I'm like you now. I'm
not human any more.

54:59.922 --> 55:01.801
I can make you human again.

55:01.802 --> 55:04.842
It's all just atoms, you can
rearrange them any way you like.

55:05.922 --> 55:08.161
I can put you back home,
you can make chips,

55:08.162 --> 55:12.922
and live your life, or
you can come with me.

55:18.842 --> 55:21.161
It's up to you, Bill.

55:21.162 --> 55:23.882
But before you make up your mind...

55:26.362 --> 55:27.762
...let me show you around.

55:33.442 --> 55:35.042
Back in time for tea?

55:36.362 --> 55:37.482
If you want.

55:44.082 --> 55:45.402
You know what, old man?

55:46.522 --> 55:49.681
I'm never going to believe
you're really dead.

55:49.682 --> 55:53.322
Because one day everyone's just
going to need you too much.

55:54.522 --> 55:56.082
Until then.

56:04.402 --> 56:05.802
It's a big universe.

56:06.882 --> 56:08.162
But I hope I see you again.

56:18.522 --> 56:20.362
Where there's tears, there's hope.

56:27.362 --> 56:32.962
Just one thing, I've been through a
lot since the last time we met...

56:36.122 --> 56:37.802
...so I'll show you around.

57:06.002 --> 57:08.282
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

57:10.602 --> 57:13.521
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

57:13.523 --> 57:15.232
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

57:15.642 --> 57:17.122
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

57:20.562 --> 57:21.722
Doctor!

57:22.690 --> 57:25.722
Sontarans! Perverting the
course of human history.

57:28.602 --> 57:29.842
I don't want to go!

57:35.962 --> 57:37.202
When the Doctor...

57:40.082 --> 57:41.961
When the Doctor...

57:41.962 --> 57:44.082
was me!

57:46.522 --> 57:47.762
When the Doctor was me.

57:56.402 --> 57:59.962
It's starting, I'm regenerating.

58:01.402 --> 58:06.882
No! No! No! No! No! No!

58:20.122 --> 58:21.842
Where have you taken me?

58:23.122 --> 58:26.961
If you're trying to make a
point, I'm not listening.

58:26.962 --> 58:31.402
I don't want to change again.
Never again!

58:34.202 --> 58:36.642
I can't keep on being somebody else!

58:41.682 --> 58:45.642
Wherever it is, I'm staying!

59:00.122 --> 59:05.202
No!

59:10.162 --> 59:12.962
I will not change.

59:21.371 --> 59:24.010
I will not change. I will not!

59:24.012 --> 59:26.212
No, no, no, the whole
thing's ridiculous.

59:27.282 --> 59:30.199
Hello? Is someone there?

59:32.322 --> 59:35.282
- Who is that?
- I'm the Doctor.

59:36.922 --> 59:40.921
The Doctor. Oh, I don't think so.

59:40.922 --> 59:43.242
No, dear me, no.

59:43.242 --> 59:49.442
You may be a doctor,
but I am the Doctor.

59:51.122 --> 59:54.122
The original, you might say!
