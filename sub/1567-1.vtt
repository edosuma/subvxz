00:49.000 --> 00:51.122
<i>Calling Cape Com. Cape Com?</i>

00:51.253 --> 00:53.079
<i>This is Jupiter 16.</i>

00:53.212 --> 00:55.251
<i>Can you give a go for fourth orbit?</i>

00:55.381 --> 00:57.208
<i>Cape Com to Jupiter 16.</i>

00:57.341 --> 01:00.093
<i>Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?</i>

01:00.219 --> 01:04.003
<i>Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.</i>

01:04.140 --> 01:06.760
<i>OK. Everything looks good from here.</i>

01:06.892 --> 01:09.347
<i>You have a go for fourth orbit.</i>

01:09.477 --> 01:11.517
<i>Jupiter 16. Roger.</i>

01:11.646 --> 01:15.180
<i>You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.</i>

01:15.316 --> 01:16.859
<i>Jupiter 16, this is Cape Com.</i>

01:16.985 --> 01:18.858
<i>Start your EVA when you're ready.</i>

01:18.987 --> 01:21.691
<i>You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.</i>

01:21.823 --> 01:23.861
<i>So don't stay out too long, Chris.</i>

01:23.992 --> 01:25.189
<i>OK, flight.</i>

01:25.325 --> 01:28.410
<i>- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.</i>

01:28.537 --> 01:33.163
<i>Cape Com to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be four plus three seven.</i>

01:33.292 --> 01:36.209
<i>Four, three, two</i>

01:36.336 --> 01:38.578
<i>one, mark.</i>

01:45.219 --> 01:47.259
<i>Cape Com, this is Chris.</i>

01:47.388 --> 01:49.297
<i>I'm out.</i>

01:49.431 --> 01:51.471
<i>Everything looks OK.</i>

01:51.601 --> 01:52.929
<i>Good.</i>

01:53.060 --> 01:55.433
<i>The maneuvering unit works this time.</i>

01:55.563 --> 01:58.135
<i>I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.</i>

01:58.274 --> 02:01.358
<i>Cape Com to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.</i>

02:01.485 --> 02:03.062
<i>Hawaii, roger.</i>

02:03.195 --> 02:06.979
<i>Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.</i>

02:07.115 --> 02:08.657
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

02:08.782 --> 02:12.116
<i>An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.</i>

02:12.245 --> 02:13.490
<i>Can you see it?</i>

02:14.705 --> 02:18.241
<i>Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.</i>

02:18.834 --> 02:20.625
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

02:20.753 --> 02:24.537
<i>Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

02:24.673 --> 02:26.915
<i>An unidentified object is on our scope.</i>

02:27.551 --> 02:29.128
<i>We see nothing.</i>

02:30.262 --> 02:32.254
<i>Can you give me a bearing?</i>

02:32.388 --> 02:33.967
<i>Appears to be coming up fast,</i>

02:34.099 --> 02:36.008
<i>from astern.</i>

02:36.142 --> 02:38.182
<i>Hey, now I see it.</i>

02:38.812 --> 02:40.851
<i>It's another spacecraft!</i>

02:41.439 --> 02:43.396
<i>Repeat, it's another spacecraft!</i>

02:43.524 --> 02:46.560
<i>Does it looks like a close pass?</i>

02:46.694 --> 02:48.402
<i>You're breaking up. Say again.</i>

02:48.529 --> 02:51.696
<i>- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?</i>

02:51.824 --> 02:54.908
<i>It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!</i>

02:55.035 --> 02:57.870
<i>I repeat, the front is opening up!</i>

02:59.122 --> 03:03.831
<i>- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!</i>

03:03.961 --> 03:06.367
<i>Do you read me? You're breaking up.</i>

03:06.504 --> 03:08.960
<i>- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?</i>

03:09.090 --> 03:11.130
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

03:11.884 --> 03:14.553
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?</i>

03:14.678 --> 03:17.348
<i>You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!</i>

03:17.473 --> 03:19.513
<i>You're breaking up...</i>

03:26.273 --> 03:28.598
<i>My lead line! It's cu...</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:33.860
<i>Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.</i>

03:33.989 --> 03:37.192
<i>Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.</i>

03:37.325 --> 03:38.523
<i>Hello, Houston.</i>

03:38.660 --> 03:41.744
<i>We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.</i>

03:41.871 --> 03:44.278
<i>Unidentified object is still orbiting.</i>

03:44.415 --> 03:47.369
<i>Alert all stations and track him closely.</i>

03:57.094 --> 04:00.793
<i>It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.</i>

04:00.931 --> 04:04.181
<i>The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.</i>

04:04.309 --> 04:06.930
<i>The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.</i>

04:07.061 --> 04:09.100
<i>I hereby give notice that in 20 days</i>

04:09.230 --> 04:11.899
<i>the United States
will launch her next spaceship.</i>

04:12.024 --> 04:15.228
<i>My government has instructed me
to inform you</i>

04:15.361 --> 04:18.942
<i>that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.</i>

04:19.072 --> 04:20.732
<i>May I ask what motive</i>

04:20.866 --> 04:23.356
<i>our Russian friends would have</i>

04:23.493 --> 04:26.114
<i>for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?</i>

04:26.246 --> 04:28.867
<i>My government sees this
as a blatant attempt</i>

04:28.998 --> 04:33.494
<i>to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.</i>

04:33.627 --> 04:35.667
<i>We don't agree.</i>

04:35.797 --> 04:38.252
<i>Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced</i>

04:38.383 --> 04:41.751
<i>that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.</i>

04:41.885 --> 04:44.637
<i>Our tracking station in Singapore</i>

04:44.763 --> 04:49.140
<i>reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.</i>

04:49.267 --> 04:52.221
<i>Might I suggest
that this is where you should</i>

04:52.354 --> 04:54.595
<i>concentrate your intelligence forces?</i>

04:54.731 --> 04:58.432
<i>The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.</i>

04:58.568 --> 05:02.518
<i>As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.</i>

05:10.579 --> 05:14.162
<i>Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?</i>

05:14.291 --> 05:16.330
<i>You think we better?</i>

05:16.459 --> 05:18.452
<i>No, just different.</i>

05:18.587 --> 05:20.460
<i>Like Peking duck is different from</i>

05:20.588 --> 05:22.877
<i>Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.</i>

05:23.008 --> 05:25.131
<i>Darling, I give you very best duck.</i>

05:25.260 --> 05:27.299
<i>That would be lovely.</i>

05:27.428 --> 05:31.047
<i>We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.</i>

05:53.745 --> 05:55.488
<i>Take that door.</i>

05:55.622 --> 05:57.661
<i>The bed!</i>

06:04.546 --> 06:08.082
<i>- We're too late.
- At least he died on the job.</i>

06:08.925 --> 06:10.919
<i>He'd have wanted it this way.</i>

09:20.064 --> 09:22.685
<i>We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed</i>

09:22.816 --> 09:26.233
<i>in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,</i>

09:26.362 --> 09:28.318
<i>at the last trump.</i>

09:28.447 --> 09:32.314
<i>For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,</i>

09:32.451 --> 09:34.489
<i>and we shall all be changed.</i>

09:34.619 --> 09:38.284
<i>We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,</i>

09:38.414 --> 09:42.542
<i>looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.</i>

09:42.668 --> 09:44.625
<i>Present!</i>

09:46.839 --> 09:48.878
<i>Fire!</i>

09:49.675 --> 09:51.714
<i>Fire!</i>

09:52.719 --> 09:54.759
<i>Fire!</i>

11:06.039 --> 11:08.245
<i>- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.</i>

11:27.642 --> 11:29.350
<i>Permission to come aboard?</i>

11:29.477 --> 11:31.719
<i>- Permission granted.
- Thank you.</i>

11:34.273 --> 11:36.811
<i>- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.</i>

11:41.571 --> 11:45.071
<i>Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.</i>

11:45.200 --> 11:47.239
<i>Aye aye, sir.</i>

11:52.790 --> 11:55.495
<i>- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.</i>

11:55.626 --> 11:58.248
<i>You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.</i>

11:58.379 --> 12:00.419
<i>We corpses have no sense of timing.</i>

12:02.341 --> 12:04.168
<i>In you go... sir.</i>

12:04.301 --> 12:06.341
<i>Thank you... ma'am.</i>

12:16.646 --> 12:19.979
<i>- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

12:20.775 --> 12:23.017
<i>- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.</i>

12:23.153 --> 12:28.229
<i>Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.</i>

12:28.366 --> 12:31.901
<i>Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.</i>

12:32.036 --> 12:36.164
<i>This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?</i>

12:36.290 --> 12:38.828
<i>Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.</i>

12:38.959 --> 12:41.711
<i>If our Singapore tracking
station is correct</i>

12:41.837 --> 12:45.122
<i>about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?</i>

12:45.257 --> 12:47.878
<i>We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,</i>

12:48.009 --> 12:51.176
<i>but the PM wants us to play it
with everything we've got.</i>

12:51.304 --> 12:54.590
<i>- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.</i>

12:54.724 --> 12:57.394
<i>Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?</i>

12:58.102 --> 13:00.309
<i>- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?</i>

13:00.438 --> 13:02.845
<i>That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.</i>

13:02.982 --> 13:04.809
<i>Before the real shooting starts.</i>

13:04.942 --> 13:08.726
<i>This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.</i>

13:09.738 --> 13:12.941
<i>When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.</i>

13:13.075 --> 13:15.316
<i>Our man Henderson
will contact you there.</i>

13:15.451 --> 13:18.738
<i>- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.</i>

13:18.872 --> 13:20.449
<i>Right.</i>

13:22.000 --> 13:25.333
<i>- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

13:25.461 --> 13:26.872
<i>- 007.
- Sir?</i>

13:27.004 --> 13:29.756
<i>We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.</i>

13:29.882 --> 13:31.340
<i>- You know that?
- Yes, sir.</i>

13:31.466 --> 13:35.250
<i>My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.</i>

13:35.387 --> 13:38.553
<i>- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.</i>

13:45.521 --> 13:47.763
<i>By the way, how was the girl?</i>

13:48.566 --> 13:50.191
<i>Which girl?</i>

13:50.318 --> 13:52.690
<i>The Chinese one we fixed you up with.</i>

13:52.820 --> 13:55.192
<i>Another five minutes, I'd have found out.</i>

13:55.322 --> 13:57.992
<i>She'll never know what she missed.</i>

13:59.285 --> 14:02.369
<i>Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed</i>

14:02.496 --> 14:05.117
<i>- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.</i>

14:05.248 --> 14:08.035
<i>We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.</i>

14:08.168 --> 14:09.199
<i>Yes?</i>

14:10.795 --> 14:13.630
<i>I... love... you.</i>

14:13.756 --> 14:15.999
<i>Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.</i>

14:16.134 --> 14:17.758
<i>Don't worry, I get it.</i>

14:17.885 --> 14:19.629
<i>Sayonara.</i>

14:19.762 --> 14:22.004
<i>James... good luck.</i>

14:23.516 --> 14:25.924
<i>Instant Japanese. You may need it.</i>

14:27.478 --> 14:30.929
<i>You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.</i>

14:35.527 --> 14:37.567
<i>Stand by to load.</i>

14:40.323 --> 14:42.362
<i>Lift to the launch!</i>

14:47.414 --> 14:49.038
<i>Tube loaded.</i>

14:49.165 --> 14:50.114
<i>Hubcap open.</i>

14:53.711 --> 14:54.909
<i>Fire.</i>

16:41.896 --> 16:43.935
<i>This is your ticket.</i>

16:47.610 --> 16:49.649
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:49.904 --> 16:51.943
<i>Dozo.</i>

18:26.702 --> 18:28.411
<i>I love you.</i>

18:30.123 --> 18:31.747
<i>I have a car nearby.</i>

18:31.874 --> 18:35.540
<i>- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.</i>

18:37.838 --> 18:41.705
<i>- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.</i>

18:43.385 --> 18:44.927
<i>Mr. Henderson.</i>

18:49.349 --> 18:51.638
<i>Wasn't Mr. Henderson
able to come himself?</i>

18:51.768 --> 18:54.473
<i>- I suppose not.
- Why?</i>

18:54.604 --> 18:56.811
<i>He didn't say.</i>

19:12.037 --> 19:14.575
<i>I think it's about hotel-time.</i>

19:41.148 --> 19:43.473
<i>How long have you
worked for Henderson?</i>

19:43.608 --> 19:47.819
<i>Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.</i>

20:07.047 --> 20:10.747
<i>- Mr. Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?</i>

20:10.883 --> 20:13.838
<i>Mr. Henderson would like
to see you alone.</i>

20:23.521 --> 20:25.561
<i>Do come in.</i>

20:27.566 --> 20:29.606
<i>Mr. Henderson?</i>

20:29.735 --> 20:31.774
<i>At your service.</i>

20:47.877 --> 20:51.246
<i>I believe you wanted to
ask me some questions.</i>

20:51.381 --> 20:53.705
<i>Yes. Excuse me.</i>

20:58.929 --> 21:01.502
<i>- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.</i>

21:02.433 --> 21:04.888
<i>I lost that in Singapore in '42.</i>

21:06.269 --> 21:09.305
<i>You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,</i>

21:09.440 --> 21:12.273
<i>but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.</i>

21:12.401 --> 21:15.485
<i>Very fond of some of these old things.</i>

21:16.780 --> 21:19.650
<i>- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.</i>

21:19.782 --> 21:22.700
<i>I myself have lived here for...</i>

21:23.452 --> 21:25.492
<i>28 years.</i>

21:25.621 --> 21:28.029
<i>And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.</i>

21:28.165 --> 21:32.494
<i>- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?</i>

21:32.628 --> 21:35.297
<i>He's head of the Japanese secret service.</i>

21:35.422 --> 21:39.086
<i>And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.</i>

21:39.217 --> 21:41.257
<i>When can I see him?</i>

21:42.262 --> 21:45.346
<i>- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?</i>

21:45.473 --> 21:49.055
<i>His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.</i>

21:49.184 --> 21:51.758
<i>- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.</i>

21:51.895 --> 21:54.647
<i>That's stirred not shaken.
That was right?</i>

21:54.773 --> 21:56.397
<i>Perfect.</i>

21:56.525 --> 21:58.564
<i>Cheers.</i>

22:00.195 --> 22:02.235
<i>Russian vodka. Well done.</i>

22:02.364 --> 22:05.863
<i>Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.</i>

22:05.992 --> 22:08.199
<i>Amongst certain other things.</i>

22:08.328 --> 22:10.652
<i>Now, look. I think London's theory</i>

22:10.789 --> 22:14.288
<i>about the missile being fired
from this country is right.</i>

22:14.417 --> 22:16.955
<i>I don't know how or where.</i>

22:17.086 --> 22:19.542
<i>And don't ask me who's doing it either.</i>

22:19.672 --> 22:25.923
<i>But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.</i>

22:26.052 --> 22:28.722
<i>You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:32.050
<i>It's not Russia, old boy, I'm sure of that.</i>

22:32.184 --> 22:34.223
<i>It's not Japan either.</i>

22:34.352 --> 22:38.646
<i>Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...</i>

24:39.137 --> 24:41.176
<i>Good evening.</i>

26:06.969 --> 26:09.009
<i>Cheers.</i>

26:13.266 --> 26:15.306
<i>Siamese vodka?</i>

27:42.350 --> 27:44.389
<i>There he is!</i>

27:53.236 --> 27:54.646
<i>Freeze!</i>

28:11.544 --> 28:12.954
<i>Get in, quick!</i>

28:20.010 --> 28:22.217
<i>What the hell's the score?</i>

28:22.846 --> 28:25.515
<i>What do you mean?
My job is to help you.</i>

28:25.640 --> 28:27.680
<i>Like you helped Henderson?</i>

28:27.810 --> 28:29.967
<i>I'm taking you to a place of safety.</i>

28:30.103 --> 28:33.389
<i>No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.</i>

28:33.523 --> 28:37.603
<i>- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.</i>

29:29.993 --> 29:31.986
<i>Welcome.</i>

29:35.790 --> 29:37.664
<i>Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond.</i>

29:38.501 --> 29:40.743
<i>It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.</i>

29:43.422 --> 29:45.878
<i>And how do you like our country so far?</i>

29:48.844 --> 29:52.888
<i>I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.</i>

29:53.015 --> 29:56.679
<i>The one thing my honorable mother
taught me long ago</i>

29:56.810 --> 29:59.597
<i>was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.</i>

29:59.729 --> 30:03.774
<i>But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!</i>

30:08.112 --> 30:11.647
<i>You have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr. Bond.</i>

30:17.162 --> 30:19.202
<i>You are James Bond, aren't you?</i>

30:23.960 --> 30:27.579
<i>I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.</i>

30:28.589 --> 30:30.713
<i>Permit me to introduce myself.</i>

30:30.842 --> 30:34.175
<i>My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.</i>

30:34.303 --> 30:37.388
<i>If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?</i>

30:38.515 --> 30:40.757
<i>I... love you.</i>

30:40.893 --> 30:43.598
<i>I'm glad we got that out of the way.</i>

30:43.729 --> 30:46.813
<i>I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.</i>

30:46.940 --> 30:48.980
<i>They're from Osato's safe.</i>

30:52.237 --> 30:54.396
<i>This is an order for naval stores.</i>

30:54.531 --> 30:58.231
<i>500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.</i>

30:59.410 --> 31:01.201
<i>What is lox?</i>

31:01.328 --> 31:03.998
<i>An American name for smoked salmon.</i>

31:04.123 --> 31:07.208
<i>But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.</i>

31:07.335 --> 31:09.374
<i>Which makes rocket fuel.</i>

31:09.503 --> 31:11.543
<i>- Very interesting.
- Yes.</i>

31:11.672 --> 31:13.499
<i>We must go.</i>

31:13.632 --> 31:16.716
<i>The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.</i>

31:16.843 --> 31:18.920
<i>That wouldn't be difficult.</i>

31:19.054 --> 31:21.342
<i>I'd like that negative enlarged.</i>

31:21.473 --> 31:23.512
<i>OK.</i>

31:29.230 --> 31:30.973
<i>My private train.</i>

31:31.107 --> 31:33.479
<i>I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.</i>

31:33.609 --> 31:36.361
<i>In my position, it would be most unwise.</i>

31:40.324 --> 31:42.067
<i>Very convenient.</i>

31:42.201 --> 31:46.033
<i>I imagine that your Mr. M in London
has a similar arrangement.</i>

31:46.163 --> 31:48.202
<i>M? Oh yes, but of course.</i>

31:48.331 --> 31:51.285
<i>Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.</i>

31:51.418 --> 31:53.244
<i>- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.</i>

31:53.378 --> 31:55.085
<i>- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.</i>

31:55.213 --> 31:58.997
<i>Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?</i>

31:59.133 --> 32:00.960
<i>Oh, no. I like sake.</i>

32:03.012 --> 32:06.178
<i>Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.</i>

32:06.307 --> 32:08.382
<i>98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.</i>

32:08.517 --> 32:11.684
<i>For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.</i>

32:13.938 --> 32:16.809
<i>- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.</i>

32:23.073 --> 32:25.777
<i>A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.</i>

32:25.909 --> 32:27.865
<i>My men found a microdot on the paper.</i>

32:27.993 --> 32:30.033
<i>Enlarge!</i>

32:30.163 --> 32:35.619
<i>It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'</i>

32:35.751 --> 32:38.871
<i>'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.'</i>

32:39.004 --> 32:42.538
<i>- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.</i>

32:42.674 --> 32:46.043
<i>They killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?</i>

32:46.177 --> 32:48.335
<i>Can you make it bigger?</i>

32:48.472 --> 32:50.298
<i>Ning-Po.</i>

32:50.431 --> 32:53.468
<i>Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.</i>

32:53.601 --> 32:56.555
<i>All recent movements
and present whereabouts.</i>

32:57.688 --> 33:00.808
<i>- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!</i>

33:00.941 --> 33:03.432
<i>Ama. Diving girls.</i>

33:03.569 --> 33:05.609
<i>Can you identify that coastline?</i>

33:05.738 --> 33:07.777
<i>Given time, yes.</i>

33:13.411 --> 33:16.282
<i>- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr. Osato.</i>

33:16.414 --> 33:19.083
<i>Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?</i>

33:19.208 --> 33:20.537
<i>Of course.</i>

33:20.668 --> 33:23.242
<i>But tonight, consider my house yours.</i>

33:23.379 --> 33:26.545
<i>Including all of my possessions,
naturally.</i>

33:34.848 --> 33:37.884
<i>My friend, now you take
your first civilized bath.</i>

33:38.018 --> 33:40.556
<i>Really? Well, I like the plumbing.</i>

33:40.687 --> 33:44.519
<i>Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear Bond-san.</i>

33:44.649 --> 33:47.934
<i>Rule number one...
is never do anything for yourself</i>

33:48.069 --> 33:50.227
<i>when someone else can do it for you.</i>

33:50.363 --> 33:52.901
<i>- And number two?
- Rule number two:</i>

33:53.074 --> 33:56.857
<i>in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.</i>

33:56.994 --> 33:59.200
<i>I might just retire to here.</i>

34:04.418 --> 34:08.331
<i>Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.</i>

34:08.463 --> 34:10.835
<i>I know one or two
who might get round to it.</i>

34:10.965 --> 34:13.456
<i>Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?</i>

34:13.592 --> 34:16.130
<i>We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.</i>

34:17.388 --> 34:20.092
<i>Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?</i>

34:26.188 --> 34:29.473
<i>I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.</i>

34:29.608 --> 34:34.270
<i>It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.</i>

34:34.404 --> 34:36.443
<i>Japanese proverb say,</i>

34:36.572 --> 34:40.072
<i>'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'</i>

34:45.081 --> 34:47.121
<i>If Henderson's theory is right,</i>

34:47.250 --> 34:50.867
<i>why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?</i>

34:51.003 --> 34:54.585
<i>Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.</i>

34:54.715 --> 34:57.881
<i>Especially if some private organization's
doing the work.</i>

34:58.009 --> 35:00.049
<i>- Osato?
- Perhaps.</i>

35:00.179 --> 35:02.966
<i>Mr. Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.</i>

35:03.098 --> 35:04.841
<i>No, he's merely a front.</i>

35:04.974 --> 35:07.975
<i>- Who is big enough?
- SPECTER.</i>

35:08.102 --> 35:09.430
<i>Could be.</i>

35:09.562 --> 35:12.397
<i>Now, massage. Which girl do you select?</i>

35:17.820 --> 35:20.109
<i>I'll settle for this little old lady here.</i>

35:20.239 --> 35:21.484
<i>Good choice.</i>

35:21.615 --> 35:23.654
<i>She's very sexyful.</i>

35:31.166 --> 35:35.080
<i>The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.</i>

35:36.712 --> 35:40.413
<i>But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.</i>

35:40.549 --> 35:44.133
<i>We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.</i>

35:45.012 --> 35:47.633
<i>So, we never got around to finishing it.</i>

35:49.058 --> 35:51.300
<i>This time, you shall finish it.</i>

35:54.396 --> 35:55.974
<i>Aki.</i>

36:02.904 --> 36:05.360
<i>No one will disturb you tonight.</i>

36:09.786 --> 36:13.368
<i>I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.</i>

36:39.313 --> 36:40.807
<i>- Mr. Fisher?
- Yes.</i>

36:40.939 --> 36:43.477
<i>- This way, please.
- Thank you.</i>

36:50.198 --> 36:52.237
<i>Please come in, Mr. Fisher.</i>

36:52.367 --> 36:55.154
<i>- Mr. Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.</i>

36:55.287 --> 36:57.326
<i>You are three and a half minutes early.</i>

36:57.455 --> 36:59.494
<i>Please be seated.</i>

38:25.747 --> 38:28.036
<i>- How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
- How do you do?</i>

38:28.166 --> 38:31.250
<i>Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.</i>

38:31.377 --> 38:33.416
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

38:33.545 --> 38:37.495
<i>- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.</i>

38:37.633 --> 38:39.673
<i>- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.</i>

38:39.802 --> 38:42.672
<i>I always take a glass in the morning.</i>

38:42.804 --> 38:45.260
<i>- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.</i>

38:45.390 --> 38:49.518
<i>- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.</i>

38:55.692 --> 38:58.728
<i>A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr. Fisher.</i>

38:58.861 --> 39:02.610
<i>- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.</i>

39:02.740 --> 39:05.824
<i>- Please be seated, Mr. Fisher.
- Thank you.</i>

39:11.456 --> 39:13.579
<i>So, you are the new managing director</i>

39:13.709 --> 39:15.535
<i>- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.</i>

39:15.669 --> 39:18.290
<i>- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?</i>

39:18.421 --> 39:21.091
<i>He died rather suddenly, poor chap.</i>

39:21.216 --> 39:23.124
<i>Ah, so. From what?</i>

39:23.259 --> 39:25.299
<i>He fell into a pulverizer at the works.</i>

39:25.428 --> 39:27.467
<i>Ah, so.</i>

39:27.596 --> 39:29.636
<i>How shocking.</i>

39:30.515 --> 39:34.051
<i>- A very honorable death, all the same.
- Very.</i>

39:34.186 --> 39:36.427
<i>He gained great face with the company.</i>

39:37.606 --> 39:41.141
<i>I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr. Fisher.</i>

39:41.276 --> 39:43.684
<i>Me? I never take any risks.</i>

39:43.820 --> 39:46.691
<i>You forgive me for saying so, but...</i>

39:47.657 --> 39:49.697
<i>I think you are taking one now.</i>

39:50.618 --> 39:51.614
<i>I am?</i>

39:51.744 --> 39:53.867
<i>You should give up smoking.</i>

39:53.996 --> 39:56.072
<i>Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.</i>

39:56.206 --> 39:58.911
<i>Mr. Osato believes in a healthy chest.</i>

39:59.042 --> 40:00.786
<i>Really?</i>

40:00.920 --> 40:03.956
<i>You must tell me what I can do for you.</i>

40:04.089 --> 40:07.789
<i>We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.</i>

40:07.926 --> 40:11.010
<i>Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.</i>

40:11.138 --> 40:14.720
<i>- Would you like a manufacturing license?
- Yes, very much.</i>

40:14.849 --> 40:18.977
<i>I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations</i>

40:19.103 --> 40:21.890
<i>and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.</i>

40:22.022 --> 40:25.522
<i>We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.</i>

40:25.651 --> 40:28.605
<i>- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.</i>

40:30.363 --> 40:32.156
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.</i>

40:32.283 --> 40:35.236
<i>- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.</i>

40:36.537 --> 40:39.241
<i>- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.</i>

40:43.417 --> 40:45.457
<i>Kill him.</i>

41:02.186 --> 41:03.466
<i>Get down!</i>

41:45.476 --> 41:48.726
<i>294 here. Tiger, immediate.</i>

41:48.854 --> 41:50.894
<i>Come in, 294.</i>

41:51.023 --> 41:56.147
<i>Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.</i>

41:56.278 --> 41:58.354
<i>I'm heading south for Highway Two.</i>

41:58.488 --> 42:00.565
<i>Arrange usual reception, please.</i>

43:35.413 --> 43:39.245
<i>- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.</i>

43:41.376 --> 43:44.460
<i>- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.</i>

43:44.588 --> 43:46.830
<i>Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.</i>

43:46.965 --> 43:50.880
<i>- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.</i>

43:51.011 --> 43:54.260
<i>Sailing for Shanghai
at 5 p.m. this afternoon.</i>

43:55.140 --> 43:58.722
<i>Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.</i>

43:58.851 --> 44:01.472
<i>- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.</i>

44:01.604 --> 44:03.846
<i>Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.</i>

44:03.981 --> 44:06.020
<i>Tiger, contact M.</i>

44:06.942 --> 44:08.982
<i>Tell him to send Little Nellie.</i>

44:09.111 --> 44:11.150
<i>Repeat, Little Nellie.</i>

44:11.280 --> 44:13.569
<i>Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.</i>

44:13.699 --> 44:15.738
<i>Most urgent. Understood?</i>

44:15.867 --> 44:17.492
<i>Understood.</i>

44:43.435 --> 44:46.389
<i>Condensation: ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.</i>

45:17.593 --> 45:19.631
<i>Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.</i>

45:19.761 --> 45:21.801
<i>I'm not leaving you.</i>

45:21.930 --> 45:25.630
<i>Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.</i>

45:25.766 --> 45:27.594
<i>Go now.</i>

46:56.477 --> 46:58.516
<i>Take him to Number 11.</i>

47:01.148 --> 47:03.769
<i>- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?</i>

47:05.485 --> 47:07.443
<i>Where am I?</i>

47:07.571 --> 47:09.610
<i>You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.</i>

47:09.739 --> 47:13.488
<i>Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.</i>

47:14.076 --> 47:15.868
<i>I've got you now.</i>

47:15.995 --> 47:17.988
<i>Enjoy yourself.</i>

47:20.040 --> 47:23.540
<i>- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.</i>

47:23.669 --> 47:27.120
<i>- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.</i>

47:27.256 --> 47:30.422
<i>And why were you
snooping around the docks?</i>

47:30.551 --> 47:33.504
<i>I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.</i>

47:33.637 --> 47:35.344
<i>You are a liar.</i>

47:41.478 --> 47:44.395
<i>- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.</i>

47:44.522 --> 47:47.227
<i>Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.</i>

47:48.192 --> 47:50.268
<i>They use it to slice off skin.</i>

47:53.739 --> 47:56.195
<i>I hope you won't force me to use it.</i>

48:04.833 --> 48:08.118
<i>Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?</i>

48:18.137 --> 48:20.343
<i>I have a confession to make.</i>

48:20.473 --> 48:22.216
<i>What?</i>

48:22.349 --> 48:24.922
<i>Actually, I'm a spy.</i>

48:25.060 --> 48:27.099
<i>I know that.</i>

48:32.400 --> 48:35.770
<i>I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?</i>

48:37.780 --> 48:42.941
<i>I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.</i>

48:43.077 --> 48:44.358
<i>And...</i>

48:44.495 --> 48:46.653
<i>Well, it's worth</i>

48:46.789 --> 48:48.865
<i>$300,000.</i>

48:49.666 --> 48:50.864
<i>So?</i>

48:51.001 --> 48:55.294
<i>I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.</i>

48:55.422 --> 48:57.545
<i>That's a nice offer.</i>

48:57.674 --> 49:01.542
<i>- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.</i>

49:01.678 --> 49:03.302
<i>Why?</i>

49:08.768 --> 49:10.807
<i>Osato would kill me.</i>

49:14.857 --> 49:17.941
<i>We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and I.</i>

49:43.217 --> 49:45.458
<i>The things I do for England.</i>

49:56.271 --> 50:00.434
<i>Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo</i>

50:00.566 --> 50:03.982
<i>because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.</i>

50:04.111 --> 50:06.151
<i>You'll need the best man we've got.</i>

50:06.280 --> 50:08.319
<i>And who do you suggest?</i>

50:08.950 --> 50:10.278
<i>Well,</i>

50:10.409 --> 50:11.607
<i>me.</i>

50:11.744 --> 50:14.947
<i>I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr. Fisher.</i>

50:17.082 --> 50:20.166
<i>I'm awfully sorry to leave you...
but I have to get off.</i>

51:18.014 --> 51:21.881
<i>Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.</i>

51:22.018 --> 51:24.687
<i>He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.</i>

51:24.812 --> 51:27.019
<i>He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.</i>

51:27.148 --> 51:29.140
<i>- Would you?
- Heaven forbid.</i>

51:29.275 --> 51:31.066
<i>Any progress?</i>

51:31.194 --> 51:34.111
<i>Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.</i>

51:34.238 --> 51:38.900
<i>It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.</i>

51:39.034 --> 51:41.276
<i>We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.</i>

51:41.412 --> 51:43.569
<i>- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.</i>

51:43.705 --> 51:47.121
<i>It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.</i>

51:47.250 --> 51:50.085
<i>But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.</i>

51:50.211 --> 51:52.452
<i>That one we took last night.</i>

51:54.090 --> 51:56.842
<i>And that one, early this morning.</i>

51:57.802 --> 52:00.968
<i>- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.</i>

52:01.096 --> 52:03.504
<i>Fully laden here and empty here.</i>

52:04.475 --> 52:06.763
<i>I want to take a fast look
at the island now.</i>

52:06.894 --> 52:10.393
<i>- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.</i>

52:12.357 --> 52:15.477
<i>Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?</i>

52:15.610 --> 52:19.559
<i>Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.</i>

52:19.698 --> 52:22.152
<i>I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.</i>

52:39.717 --> 52:41.756
<i>I have much curiosity, Bond-san.</i>

52:41.885 --> 52:43.676
<i>What is Little Nellie?</i>

52:43.803 --> 52:47.421
<i>She's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.</i>

52:47.557 --> 52:49.763
<i>Can do anything. Just your type.</i>

52:49.893 --> 52:51.885
<i>A toy helicopter?</i>

52:52.019 --> 52:55.602
<i>No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.</i>

52:55.731 --> 52:58.602
<i>We've made some improvements
since you used her last.</i>

52:58.734 --> 53:02.483
<i>- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!</i>

53:02.613 --> 53:04.688
<i>Take my helicopter instead.</i>

53:06.158 --> 53:08.198
<i>Right. Now pay attention.</i>

53:08.327 --> 53:10.995
<i>- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronized to what?</i>

53:11.121 --> 53:14.157
<i>100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.</i>

53:14.291 --> 53:16.283
<i>Two rocket launchers,</i>

53:16.417 --> 53:19.038
<i>- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.</i>

53:19.170 --> 53:23.547
<i>Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.</i>

53:23.674 --> 53:24.954
<i>Good.</i>

53:25.092 --> 53:27.713
<i>Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.</i>

53:27.844 --> 53:31.427
<i>- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.</i>

53:33.058 --> 53:35.430
<i>Aerial mines. Now remember,</i>

53:35.561 --> 53:38.015
<i>use them only
when directly above target.</i>

53:38.147 --> 53:41.480
<i>- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.</i>

53:42.316 --> 53:44.108
<i>Cine camera.</i>

53:44.235 --> 53:47.568
<i>- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!</i>

53:47.696 --> 53:50.069
<i>I'll contact you when I get over the island.</i>

53:50.199 --> 53:52.321
<i>Be careful, Bond-san!</i>

54:53.175 --> 54:55.251
<i>Hello, Base One.</i>

54:55.386 --> 54:58.884
<i>I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.</i>

54:59.014 --> 55:00.888
<i>We'll keep listening.</i>

55:29.125 --> 55:32.660
<i>Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.</i>

55:32.796 --> 55:35.796
<i>Understood. Carry on.</i>

58:32.381 --> 58:34.420
<i>- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.</i>

58:34.549 --> 58:36.589
<i>Little Nellie got a hot reception.</i>

58:36.719 --> 58:39.090
<i>Four big-shots made
improper advances,</i>

58:39.221 --> 58:42.138
<i>but she defended her honor
with great success.</i>

58:42.266 --> 58:44.388
<i>- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.</i>

58:44.517 --> 58:46.557
<i>Russian space shot imminent.</i>

58:46.686 --> 58:49.687
<i>Proceed vector 4-6 degrees
and await instructions.</i>

58:49.814 --> 58:51.806
<i>- Understood?
- Roger and out.</i>

01:02:07.771 --> 01:02:10.807
<i>Clear the area. Clear the area.</i>

01:02:20.992 --> 01:02:23.031
<i>Prepare for reception.</i>

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:26.410
<i>Prepare for reception.</i>

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:29.999
<i>Radar blackout is now complete.</i>

01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:34.085
<i>Radar blackout is now complete.</i>

01:02:51.729 --> 01:02:54.350
<i>Moscow radio's already saying we did it.</i>

01:02:54.482 --> 01:02:57.268
<i>The president's called
a press conference for 2 p.m.</i>

01:02:57.401 --> 01:02:59.773
<i>He'll deny emphatically we were involved.</i>

01:02:59.903 --> 01:03:01.943
<i>- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.</i>

01:03:02.072 --> 01:03:04.230
<i>No one will believe the Russians did it.</i>

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:07.616
<i>Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.</i>

01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:12.205
<i>Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's off the screen.</i>

01:03:12.332 --> 01:03:14.371
<i>That means he's coming down.</i>

01:03:14.501 --> 01:03:18.450
<i>- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.</i>

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:22.333
<i>The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.</i>

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.506
<i>- Forget Japan.
- I agree.</i>

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:28.004
<i>We've re-photographed
every square inch.</i>

01:04:03.088 --> 01:04:05.875
<i>Ventilator fans to full power.</i>

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.046
<i>Open all air ducts.</i>

01:04:08.176 --> 01:04:10.216
<i>Area safe to enter.</i>

01:04:10.345 --> 01:04:12.384
<i>All crews to stations.</i>

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:14.720
<i>All air ducts to normal.</i>

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:18.598
<i>Air ducts opened.</i>

01:04:18.728 --> 01:04:20.886
<i>- Close crater.
- Closing crater.</i>

01:04:21.897 --> 01:04:23.936
<i>Fire guards to station.</i>

01:04:35.159 --> 01:04:38.409
<i>Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.</i>

01:04:40.998 --> 01:04:43.038
<i>Reception complete.</i>

01:04:45.252 --> 01:04:47.625
<i>Withdraw captive spaceship.</i>

01:04:50.841 --> 01:04:52.881
<i>Guards to stations.</i>

01:05:23.205 --> 01:05:26.371
<i>Remove the prisoners.</i>

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.849
<i>I shall be in my apartment.</i>

01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:54.140
<i>I may send for you later.</i>

01:06:22.093 --> 01:06:25.759
<i>I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.</i>

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:28.843
<i>We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.</i>

01:06:28.975 --> 01:06:32.260
<i>Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?</i>

01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:35.846
<i>- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.</i>

01:06:35.982 --> 01:06:37.524
<i>Hans!</i>

01:06:42.237 --> 01:06:45.820
<i>You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.</i>

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:50.691
<i>They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.</i>

01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:05.756
<i>I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.</i>

01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:10.214
<i>I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,</i>

01:07:10.347 --> 01:07:12.969
<i>deposited in our account in Buenos Aires.</i>

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.591
<i>Our agreement states
no money should be paid</i>

01:07:15.728 --> 01:07:19.262
<i>until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.</i>

01:07:19.397 --> 01:07:23.560
<i>- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.</i>

01:07:23.693 --> 01:07:26.148
<i>Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.</i>

01:07:27.113 --> 01:07:30.316
<i>Osato and Number 11, report now.</i>

01:07:45.171 --> 01:07:48.338
<i>An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.</i>

01:07:48.467 --> 01:07:50.375
<i>Correct, Number One.</i>

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.464
<i>- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.</i>

01:07:54.472 --> 01:07:57.722
<i>Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.</i>

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:01.051
<i>James Bond.</i>

01:08:01.562 --> 01:08:04.765
<i>- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.</i>

01:08:04.898 --> 01:08:06.227
<i>Rubbish.</i>

01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:08.351
<i>Bond is alive.</i>

01:08:08.486 --> 01:08:10.810
<i>Unless you killed him, Mr. Osato?</i>

01:08:12.072 --> 01:08:14.112
<i>Don't tell me you let him go.</i>

01:08:14.574 --> 01:08:17.741
<i>I gave Number 11
the strictest orders to eliminate him.</i>

01:08:17.868 --> 01:08:19.694
<i>And did she?</i>

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.952
<i>She failed.</i>

01:08:22.081 --> 01:08:25.413
<i>You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.</i>

01:08:25.542 --> 01:08:28.330
<i>This organization
does not tolerate failure.</i>

01:08:28.462 --> 01:08:31.380
<i>- I know, but you see, I...
- Go!</i>

01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:35.004
<i>Well?</i>

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:46.140
<i>Osato!</i>

01:08:55.362 --> 01:08:57.818
<i>Kill Bond! Now!</i>

01:08:58.491 --> 01:09:00.981
<i>Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.</i>

01:09:41.238 --> 01:09:43.908
<i>- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.</i>

01:09:44.033 --> 01:09:47.651
<i>Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.</i>

01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:49.910
<i>Next time it will be war.</i>

01:09:50.038 --> 01:09:52.956
<i>- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.</i>

01:09:53.084 --> 01:09:56.167
<i>We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.</i>

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:58.453
<i>Do you have any commandos here?</i>

01:09:58.589 --> 01:10:00.628
<i>I have much, much better.</i>

01:10:01.133 --> 01:10:03.540
<i>Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.</i>

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:06.508
<i>This is my ninja training school.</i>

01:10:13.394 --> 01:10:16.763
<i>- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.</i>

01:10:52.765 --> 01:10:55.221
<i>This must develop
very fast reflex actions.</i>

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.094
<i>And spiritual strength.</i>

01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:33.092
<i>Now, we will see some modern ninjas.</i>

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.679
<i>My plan is this.</i>

01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:40.847
<i>I make a base on the Ama island.</i>

01:11:40.977 --> 01:11:43.432
<i>100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.</i>

01:11:44.188 --> 01:11:46.476
<i>They will be workers and fishermen.</i>

01:11:46.607 --> 01:11:48.646
<i>- What about me?
- Later.</i>

01:11:48.776 --> 01:11:52.226
<i>But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.</i>

01:11:52.363 --> 01:11:53.987
<i>Very powerful.</i>

01:11:54.114 --> 01:11:56.652
<i>See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.</i>

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:02.872
<i>- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.</i>

01:12:04.582 --> 01:12:06.705
<i>This is our special baby rocket.</i>

01:12:08.086 --> 01:12:11.537
<i>Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.</i>

01:12:18.804 --> 01:12:21.721
<i>- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.</i>

01:12:21.848 --> 01:12:25.348
<i>- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.</i>

01:12:26.937 --> 01:12:30.305
<i>- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.</i>

01:12:30.439 --> 01:12:32.765
<i>Second, you train hard and quickly</i>

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.308
<i>to become a ninja like us.</i>

01:12:35.861 --> 01:12:39.397
<i>And third, to give you extra-special cover,</i>

01:12:39.532 --> 01:12:41.571
<i>you take a wife.</i>

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:52.123
<i>Regretfully impossible.</i>

01:12:52.252 --> 01:12:54.079
<i>You must marry Ama girl.</i>

01:12:54.212 --> 01:12:56.288
<i>One who is known on the island.</i>

01:12:56.422 --> 01:12:59.756
<i>- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.</i>

01:12:59.884 --> 01:13:03.299
<i>- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.</i>

01:13:05.473 --> 01:13:08.011
<i>The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.</i>

01:13:08.142 --> 01:13:10.549
<i>But first, you must become Japanese.</i>

01:13:15.732 --> 01:13:18.603
<i>Eyepieces to Hera.</i>

01:13:24.282 --> 01:13:26.571
<i>Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?</i>

01:13:36.544 --> 01:13:40.043
<i>- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.</i>

01:13:45.844 --> 01:13:48.513
<i>Tiger said, from now on,</i>

01:13:48.638 --> 01:13:51.555
<i>you must do everything Japanese-style.</i>

01:13:51.683 --> 01:13:53.676
<i>Everything?</i>

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.849
<i>Good for Tiger.</i>

01:16:00.596 --> 01:16:02.138
<i>I'm...</i>

01:16:04.599 --> 01:16:06.924
<i>I... I...</i>

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.091
<i>Aki!</i>

01:16:08.228 --> 01:16:10.267
<i>I'm...</i>

01:16:18.946 --> 01:16:20.986
<i>She's dead.</i>

01:16:22.075 --> 01:16:24.114
<i>Poisoned.</i>

01:16:27.663 --> 01:16:29.904
<i>Tiger, we must get to that island.</i>

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.326
<i>You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.</i>

01:17:14.415 --> 01:17:17.701
<i>- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.</i>

01:17:21.213 --> 01:17:23.253
<i>This man is a stranger from outside.</i>

01:17:25.217 --> 01:17:27.458
<i>It's lucky we're getting out of here.</i>

01:17:27.595 --> 01:17:31.426
<i>Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.</i>

01:17:31.556 --> 01:17:33.596
<i>Yeah, with a face like a pig.</i>

01:21:06.425 --> 01:21:08.464
<i>My men are already ashore.</i>

01:21:08.593 --> 01:21:10.633
<i>All over the island.</i>

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:14.511
<i>We have four days left.
It is not much time.</i>

01:22:15.991 --> 01:22:18.029
<i>This is my house.</i>

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.158
<i>My friend has made us some food.</i>

01:22:25.249 --> 01:22:27.289
<i>Do you live here alone?</i>

01:22:27.418 --> 01:22:30.039
<i>Yes. My parents are dead.</i>

01:22:30.171 --> 01:22:32.210
<i>Sit down, please.</i>

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:35.960
<i>Oysters.</i>

01:22:36.093 --> 01:22:38.714
<i>Is this the only room there is?</i>

01:22:38.845 --> 01:22:40.588
<i>Yes.</i>

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.761
<i>That is your bed.</i>

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.930
<i>I shall sleep over there.</i>

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.680
<i>- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.</i>

01:22:49.813 --> 01:22:51.853
<i>You gave false name to priest.</i>

01:22:51.982 --> 01:22:55.185
<i>But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.</i>

01:22:55.319 --> 01:22:57.810
<i>No honeymoon. This is business.</i>

01:23:02.409 --> 01:23:04.651
<i>I won't need these.</i>

01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:36.726
<i>- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?</i>

01:23:37.442 --> 01:23:40.229
<i>The Americans have changed
the launching date.</i>

01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:42.400
<i>The countdown has already started.</i>

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:45.615
<i>The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.</i>

01:23:45.742 --> 01:23:48.362
<i>- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.</i>

01:23:48.494 --> 01:23:52.242
<i>- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.</i>

01:23:52.372 --> 01:23:54.412
<i>Everything is so normal around here.</i>

01:23:54.541 --> 01:23:56.829
<i>- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.</i>

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.080
<i>Yesterday an Ama girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.</i>

01:24:00.213 --> 01:24:02.835
<i>- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.</i>

01:24:02.966 --> 01:24:05.373
<i>And when her boat floated out again,</i>

01:24:05.509 --> 01:24:07.337
<i>she was dead.</i>

01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:12.389
<i>- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.</i>

01:24:12.516 --> 01:24:14.842
<i>- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.</i>

01:24:16.645 --> 01:24:18.685
<i>- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.</i>

01:24:18.814 --> 01:24:20.557
<i>We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.</i>

01:25:03.022 --> 01:25:04.849
<i>All right?</i>

01:25:04.982 --> 01:25:07.022
<i>Now, where is this cave?</i>

01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:09.190
<i>It's straight across.</i>

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.360
<i>The cave is over there.</i>

01:25:40.224 --> 01:25:42.263
<i>Gas. Get over the side.</i>

01:25:42.392 --> 01:25:43.721
<i>Quick!</i>

01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:11.917
<i>Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.</i>

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.871
<i>Did you notice the sulfur on the walls?</i>

01:26:15.006 --> 01:26:17.046
<i>- The yellow?
- Yes.</i>

01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:20.425
<i>It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.</i>

01:26:20.553 --> 01:26:24.219
<i>- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.</i>

01:26:24.349 --> 01:26:26.673
<i>It leads all the way,</i>

01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:28.304
<i>right up to the top.</i>

01:26:28.436 --> 01:26:30.724
<i>That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?</i>

01:26:30.854 --> 01:26:33.524
<i>Of course. It's business.</i>

01:26:33.649 --> 01:26:35.059
<i>Good.</i>

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.290
<i>May I rest a moment?</i>

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.459
<i>Surely.</i>

01:27:00.758 --> 01:27:02.798
<i>It's hard work.</i>

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:05.927
<i>Some honeymoon!</i>

01:27:34.165 --> 01:27:37.414
<i>It's going down! into the volcano!</i>

01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:44.669
<i>Heliport to position.</i>

01:27:46.885 --> 01:27:49.292
<i>The honeymoon's over. Come on.</i>

01:28:25.045 --> 01:28:27.666
<i>This volcano isn't active, is it?</i>

01:28:27.798 --> 01:28:30.123
<i>It never has been. Not in my lifetime.</i>

01:28:30.259 --> 01:28:33.378
<i>There's been some
terrific heat here recently.</i>

01:28:33.511 --> 01:28:35.588
<i>What happened to the helicopter?</i>

01:28:35.722 --> 01:28:37.761
<i>It's down there somewhere.</i>

01:28:38.683 --> 01:28:40.722
<i>Come on.</i>

01:28:42.854 --> 01:28:44.846
<i>Stand by. Mark.</i>

01:28:44.981 --> 01:28:47.139
<i>Stand by for ten-second countdown.</i>

01:28:47.275 --> 01:28:49.066
<i>10, 9, 8...</i>

01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:51.980
<i>All units worldwide
will remain at readiness</i>

01:28:52.112 --> 01:28:54.354
<i>so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.</i>

01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:56.608
<i>...3, 2, 1.</i>

01:28:58.494 --> 01:29:00.533
<i>Ignition.</i>

01:29:11.089 --> 01:29:14.339
<i>This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.</i>

01:29:35.654 --> 01:29:37.527
<i>Is that deep?</i>

01:29:37.655 --> 01:29:39.695
<i>They usually are - very.</i>

01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:46.327
<i>It's metal!</i>

01:29:46.455 --> 01:29:48.495
<i>Wait here.</i>

01:30:02.804 --> 01:30:05.426
<i>Heliport to takeoff position.</i>

01:30:11.937 --> 01:30:13.646
<i>Open crater.</i>

01:30:32.416 --> 01:30:34.289
<i>Emergency crews to stations.</i>

01:30:37.086 --> 01:30:40.206
<i>Go to Tanaka.
Tell him to come with every man he's got.</i>

01:30:40.339 --> 01:30:41.502
<i>Yes.</i>

01:31:14.997 --> 01:31:17.618
<i>Heliport to standby position.</i>

01:31:59.997 --> 01:32:02.489
<i>Astronauts to dressing rooms.</i>

01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:05.415
<i>Astronauts to dressing rooms.</i>

01:32:15.846 --> 01:32:17.672
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

01:32:17.806 --> 01:32:21.305
<i>American target vehicle is now in orbit.</i>

01:32:22.227 --> 01:32:25.393
<i>Interception will take place
in two hours' time.</i>

01:32:40.327 --> 01:32:42.367
<i>Washington, this is Houston.</i>

01:32:42.496 --> 01:32:44.535
<i>Houston to Washington.</i>

01:32:45.249 --> 01:32:49.080
<i>Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude,</i>

01:32:49.794 --> 01:32:52.499
<i>170 miles downrange.</i>

01:32:55.716 --> 01:32:59.002
<i>Jupiter to Houston,
we now have second phase.</i>

01:32:59.137 --> 01:33:01.129
<i>Roger, Jupiter.</i>

01:33:01.263 --> 01:33:04.264
<i>Four hours 36 minutes into the mission.</i>

01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:07.096
<i>- Can you give us a time?
- Roger.</i>

01:33:10.773 --> 01:33:12.812
<i>Connect igniter cable.</i>

01:33:14.317 --> 01:33:16.524
<i>Connect igniter cable.</i>

01:33:42.886 --> 01:33:45.721
<i>Radar technicians, report to control room.</i>

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:50.014
<i>Radar technicians, report to control room.</i>

01:34:09.161 --> 01:34:12.115
<i>T minus 100 minutes and counting.</i>

01:34:13.373 --> 01:34:16.374
<i>Did you volunteer for astronaut training?</i>

01:34:16.501 --> 01:34:19.667
<i>In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, both of us...</i>

01:34:22.215 --> 01:34:25.002
<i>Yes, since six months we started training.</i>

01:34:26.051 --> 01:34:28.009
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:34:28.137 --> 01:34:30.010
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

01:34:30.138 --> 01:34:32.594
<i>Stand back, I'm gonna blow the lock.</i>

01:34:39.981 --> 01:34:42.104
<i>Stand back.</i>

01:34:51.617 --> 01:34:53.657
<i>Get into their uniforms.</i>

01:35:56.137 --> 01:35:58.461
<i>Astronauts have two minutes.</i>

01:35:58.597 --> 01:36:00.637
<i>Repeat, two minutes.</i>

01:36:07.481 --> 01:36:10.517
<i>Reserve astronaut to stand by.</i>

01:36:13.153 --> 01:36:16.237
<i>- Lock on target.
- Lock on target vehicle.</i>

01:36:16.364 --> 01:36:18.605
<i>Check secondary guidance.</i>

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.319
<i>Launch time is now
T minus 90 minutes and counting.</i>

01:36:23.454 --> 01:36:25.945
<i>Astronauts to launching pad.</i>

<i>Astronauts to launching pad.</i>

01:36:29.334 --> 01:36:33.118
<i>Repeat, astronauts
to launching pad immediately.</i>

01:37:12.375 --> 01:37:15.209
<i>Crews, stand by on gantry.</i>

01:37:16.253 --> 01:37:18.162
<i>Crews, stand by on gantry.</i>

01:37:52.912 --> 01:37:56.827
<i>- Stop that astronaut. Bring him to me.
- Stop that astronaut!</i>

01:37:56.958 --> 01:38:00.458
<i>- Summon the reserve astronaut!
- Reserve astronaut!</i>

01:38:00.587 --> 01:38:04.371
<i>Reserve astronaut
to launching pad, immediately.</i>

01:38:13.265 --> 01:38:16.183
<i>Re-coordinate with target vehicle.</i>

01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:17.590
<i>A new update</i>

01:38:17.728 --> 01:38:22.224
<i>with target vehicle
has been received from computers.</i>

01:38:23.775 --> 01:38:27.986
<i>We now have T minus seven minutes
and counting.</i>

01:38:28.112 --> 01:38:30.650
<i>You made a mistake, my friend.</i>

01:38:30.782 --> 01:38:33.948
<i>No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.</i>

01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:35.820
<i>Remove his helmet!</i>

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:43.456
<i>James Bond.</i>

01:38:44.712 --> 01:38:47.381
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

01:38:48.841 --> 01:38:51.794
<i>I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.</i>

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:55.840
<i>They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.</i>

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:58.596
<i>Yes, this is my second life.</i>

01:39:00.726 --> 01:39:02.933
<i>You only live twice, Mr. Bond.</i>

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:05.732
<i>Target vehicle
passing over central Russia.</i>

01:39:05.857 --> 01:39:07.979
<i>Approaching Mongolia.</i>

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:10.860
<i>Track is as predicted. All computers...</i>

01:39:10.986 --> 01:39:14.320
<i>As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.</i>

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:18.991
<i>In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,</i>

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.870
<i>we shall see a new power
dominating the world.</i>

01:39:21.997 --> 01:39:26.243
<i>- Target vehicle on scope.
- Brief check on target vehicle.</i>

01:39:26.376 --> 01:39:28.997
<i>Remove his suit and search him.</i>

01:39:29.128 --> 01:39:32.248
<i>Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1.</i>

01:39:42.057 --> 01:39:43.385

<i>Emergency services to stand by.</i>

01:39:54.444 --> 01:39:56.483
<i>Area now clear.</i>

<i>Bird 1 now in readiness.</i>

01:40:10.084 --> 01:40:13.499
<i>Astronauts ready on Bird.
All systems are go.</i>

01:40:13.628 --> 01:40:16.712
<i>Close shutters.</i>

01:40:17.841 --> 01:40:20.960
<i>- Radar blackout commence.
- Radar blackout in operation.</i>

01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:27.100
<i>Effective range, kilometers 800.</i>

01:40:27.225 --> 01:40:30.179
<i>- Open crater.
- Opening crater.</i>

01:40:32.772 --> 01:40:34.811
<i>Crater opening.</i>

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.024
<i>Bird 1 to liftoff position.</i>

01:40:56.085 --> 01:41:00.581
<i>Gimbal the engines.
Pressurized tanks open.</i>

01:41:00.714 --> 01:41:03.715
<i>Ventilator fans to full power.</i>

01:41:03.842 --> 01:41:05.005
<i>10 seconds.</i>

01:41:05.135 --> 01:41:07.009

<i>Closing crater.</i>

01:41:50.094 --> 01:41:52.584
<i>Open shutters!</i>

01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:34.339
<i>Bird 1 to base. Separation complete.</i>

01:42:34.469 --> 01:42:36.757
<i>Confirm acquisition.</i>

<i>Calling Bird 1.</i>

01:42:39.265 --> 01:42:42.717
<i>You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.</i>

01:42:42.852 --> 01:42:45.972
<i>Hans, our job will soon be done.</i>

01:42:46.105 --> 01:42:50.601
<i>Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key</i>

01:42:51.944 --> 01:42:54.233
<i>to operate the exploder button.</i>

01:42:54.363 --> 01:42:56.604
<i>There are men in the crater!</i>

01:42:58.242 --> 01:42:59.272
<i>Crater guns, fire.</i>

01:42:59.409 --> 01:43:01.449
<i>Crater guns, open fire.</i>

01:43:23.682 --> 01:43:25.924
<i>The firing power inside my crater</i>

01:43:26.059 --> 01:43:28.348
<i>is enough to annihilate a small army.</i>

01:43:29.187 --> 01:43:31.429
<i>You can watch it all on TV.</i>

01:43:31.565 --> 01:43:34.649
<i>It's the last program
you're likely to see.</i>

01:43:34.776 --> 01:43:38.275
<i>If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?</i>

01:43:39.488 --> 01:43:41.611
<i>Yes. Give him his cigarettes.</i>

01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:45.324
<i>It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr. Bond.</i>

01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:05.256
<i>Armed guards to control room.</i>

01:44:20.194 --> 01:44:22.483
<i>- Close the crater.
- Close crater!</i>

01:44:22.613 --> 01:44:26.230
<i>I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr. Bond.</i>

01:45:23.586 --> 01:45:25.330
<i>Close the shutters.</i>

01:45:33.846 --> 01:45:36.171
<i>We are now impregnable.</i>

01:45:36.306 --> 01:45:40.174
<i>Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.</i>

01:47:09.019 --> 01:47:11.474
<i>Impregnable?</i>

01:47:11.604 --> 01:47:14.854
<i>- Come with me, Mr. Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.</i>

01:47:14.982 --> 01:47:17.604
<i>- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?</i>

01:47:19.278 --> 01:47:21.354
<i>Base calling Bird 1.</i>

01:47:21.489 --> 01:47:24.774
<i>You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.</i>

01:47:24.908 --> 01:47:26.948
<i>Seven minutes to interception.</i>

01:47:27.078 --> 01:47:29.116
<i>Roger, Base One.</i>

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:31.621
<i>Houston, this is Hawaii.</i>

01:47:31.748 --> 01:47:33.788
<i>We have an unidentified object on scope.</i>

01:47:33.918 --> 01:47:36.289
<i>Order first alert. Arm all weapons.</i>

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:39.171
<i>Interception will occur in six minutes.</i>

01:47:46.137 --> 01:47:49.304
<i>This is the price of failure, Mr. Bond.</i>

01:47:55.063 --> 01:47:57.102
<i>Come on.</i>

01:48:07.449 --> 01:48:09.655
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Bond.</i>

01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:24.332
<i>There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.</i>

01:48:24.465 --> 01:48:26.505
<i>Impossible. Too well defended.</i>

01:48:32.347 --> 01:48:34.386
<i>Evacuate the control!</i>

01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:36.350
<i>Evacuate the control!</i>

01:48:56.244 --> 01:49:00.538
<i>Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.</i>

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:14.501
<i>Give me cover till I get to the staircase.</i>

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:01.066
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

01:51:17.335 --> 01:51:20.170
<i>Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.</i>

01:51:20.839 --> 01:51:24.290
<i>All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.</i>

01:51:24.425 --> 01:51:27.212
<i>I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.</i>

01:51:57.582 --> 01:51:59.409
<i>It's blown up! The enemy!</i>

01:51:59.542 --> 01:52:01.950
<i>I repeat, the enemy has blown up.</i>

01:52:02.086 --> 01:52:04.576
<i>All units will return to first alert.</i>

01:52:04.714 --> 01:52:08.047
<i>Codeword is not -
I say again, not - imminent.</i>

01:52:11.386 --> 01:52:13.344
<i>Tiger,</i>

01:52:13.472 --> 01:52:14.753
<i>we've done it.</i>

01:52:34.324 --> 01:52:36.697
<i>Down the tunnel!</i>

01:53:58.403 --> 01:54:00.443
<i>Steady.</i>

01:54:15.711 --> 01:54:18.381
<i>Now... about that honeymoon.</i>

01:54:18.506 --> 01:54:20.546
<i>Why not?</i>

01:54:20.675 --> 01:54:22.916
<i>But they'll never let you stay.</i>

01:54:24.136 --> 01:54:26.176
<i>But they'll never find us.</i>

01:54:52.746 --> 01:54:56.365
<i>- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.</i>

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.908
<i>It'll be a pleasure, sir.</i>

01:54:59.305 --> 01:55:05.258
