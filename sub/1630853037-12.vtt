11:52.420 --> 11:54.046
Mel?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.923
My powers, they aren't working.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.057
Mine, either.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.310
Nope.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.521
And I could really use
a drink right now.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.440
(sighs)

12:12.481 --> 12:14.525
Inara must have stripped them.
MEL: Great.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.444
So we are the only beings
without powers

12:16.485 --> 12:18.404
in a completely magical world.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.031
Yeah, except for all the humans,
but...

12:21.073 --> 12:23.659
I don't think they can be
much help taking down Inara.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.745
Wait, have you guys seen
any humans around?

12:25.786 --> 12:28.038
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I have.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.040
I can't think
of any right now, but...

12:30.082 --> 12:31.709
I mean, we must've, right?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.378
Well, I've been all around
the world for the past

12:34.420 --> 12:37.047
who-knows-how-long, and I can't
remember seeing a single one.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.967
I'm calling my parents.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.469
A gemcast?

12:41.510 --> 12:43.471
Well, I guess,
I guess I can't call them.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.641
BOTH:
Ray.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.273
Ray!

12:54.315 --> 12:55.983
(knocking)

12:56.025 --> 12:58.110
It's us. Open up.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.989
Ray!

13:02.031 --> 13:04.116
Anybody home?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.829
Please be here. Please be here.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.043
Mags, look.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.297
Maybe he left in a hurry?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
Without his keys

13:20.174 --> 13:23.052
or... wallet?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.012
I don't like this.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.639
(nearby rumbling)

13:28.140 --> 13:30.643
Any luck with Brynn
or your parents?
No.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.020
Nobody was home, but, um...

13:33.062 --> 13:34.563
I found these.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.649
They were hanging
on a rosebush by the front door.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.901
My mom never takes
her rings off.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.570
I need to get some air.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.535
(exhales)

13:52.790 --> 13:54.792
KAELA:
What's that?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.086
It's Ray's mug.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.090
He always did love to have
his coffee in the backyard.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.054
Where'd you go, Ray?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.608
Guys?

14:22.987 --> 14:25.072
What's wrong?

14:26.949 --> 14:29.577
What if Ray didn't go anywhere?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.124
What if none of them did?

14:35.165 --> 14:37.877
Because... because
they couldn't, because...

14:39.211 --> 14:41.213
...they were turned
into something else?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.674
No. No, no.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.634
This isn't happening.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.012
This cannot be happening.
It already did.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.389
Months ago.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.276
Are you saying that...

15:02.318 --> 15:04.695
these plants and trees
around us are actually...

15:06.113 --> 15:07.990
...all the humans?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.295
I don't even know where
to start trying to fix this.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.713
MAGGIE:
I do.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
I'd steal Inara's powers...

15:24.715 --> 15:27.551
reverse things,
bring everyone back.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.431
But without my powers,
that's impossible.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.101
KAELA:
No.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.562
You know what I thought
was impossible?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.398
My art coming to life.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.526
Being able to instantly
portal anywhere on Earth.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.905
Loving two weirdos
as my sisters.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.368
Loss has a way of making you
forget who you are.

15:52.409 --> 15:56.205
When Dev died,
it caught me sideways.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.083
I ran away.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.085
I gave up, but not this time.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.878
Okay, as long as we
are still breathing,

16:02.920 --> 16:04.421
anything is
possible.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.757
I mean,
we're the Charmed Ones, damn it.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.801
We were the Charmed Ones.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.678
We were.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.721
And then we weren't.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.015
And then we were.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.308
Oh, my God, Mel...

16:17.226 --> 16:18.727
...you're a genius.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.563
This isn't the first time
we've lost our powers.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.149
Okay, great, so what
did you do to get them back?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.276
Black amber.
The sap of a sacred tree.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.404
The lifeblood of all magic.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.031
Right, where do we get
this black amber stuff?

16:31.073 --> 16:34.410
MAGGIE:
Black amber collects in a basin
under the sacred tree.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.371
MEL:
Which is only accessible
through the command center.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.749
And Inara has put a fancy new
lock on the switchroom door.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.960
It's called a blood hex.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
It's a very strong form
of protective magic.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.464
I'm not sure
how we can get through that.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.174
What about
the Skeleton Key Spell?

16:49.216 --> 16:52.011
That could work, but we need
a drop of Inara's blood.

16:52.052 --> 16:55.681
(laughs) Hold up, how the hell
are we supposed to get her blood

16:55.723 --> 16:58.726
without blowing our cover
or-or being blown away?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.937
MEL:
We'd need someone
in her inner circle.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.148
Someone who can get close.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.400
MAGGIE:
Someone we can trust.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.778
KAELA:
We also need him to get us
the blood without being seen.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.822
MAGGIE:
Leave that to me.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.743
Can I help you?

17:15.784 --> 17:17.494
(chuckles)

17:17.536 --> 17:19.705
Come on, come on.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.790
KAELA:
How's it going
with the potion ingredients?

17:21.832 --> 17:22.916
Any luck?

17:22.958 --> 17:25.044
No. My potion stash,

17:25.085 --> 17:27.212
all of my ingredients, gone.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.173
Tell me you found something.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.340
Nothing magical.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.467
The attic's cleaned out.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.843
She must've taken everything.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.639
She even took my cauldron.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.099
That was my baby.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.517
I spent the last three years
seasoning it

17:40.559 --> 17:42.394
like a cast iron pan.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.937
Pots and pans.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.314
Hmm?

17:45.355 --> 17:46.857
Back in Philly,
some of our clients

17:46.899 --> 17:48.400
at the shop couldn't
afford to fix everything

17:48.442 --> 17:51.403
their cars needed,
so we had to get creative.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.324
Here.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.785
A crockpot?

17:57.826 --> 17:59.453
Well, we don't need
a shiny new car.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.954
We just need
something that runs.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.040
And there's nothing that says we

18:03.082 --> 18:05.125
can't make our
own rosewater.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.376
(clicks tongue) Exactly.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.544
Okay.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.837
What else do we need?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.631
(exhales)

18:13.592 --> 18:16.095
MAGGIE:
I know, I get it.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.305
It's a lot.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.143
(groans)

18:23.185 --> 18:25.646
God. (groans softly)

18:26.855 --> 18:28.941
(sniffles)

18:30.192 --> 18:32.277
Everybody...

18:35.155 --> 18:37.282
Everybody's dead.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.829
(crying)

18:41.870 --> 18:43.956
Hey, hey.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.499
Hey, easy.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.000
It's all right.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.087
How the hell is it all right?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.173
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.509
Hey, come here,
take a seat.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.719
Trust me, trust me.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.098
Okay, hey.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.809
Just breathe.
In through the nose...

19:03.851 --> 19:04.852
(inhales deeply)

19:04.893 --> 19:06.812
(inhales)
Two, three.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.772
Out through the mouth. (exhales)

19:08.814 --> 19:11.692
(exhales)
Two, three, four.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.443
That's right.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.113
Hey, I know.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.533
I know it's horrible
and it's overwhelming.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.660
But we have a plan...

19:21.702 --> 19:23.328
to fix everything.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.208
You okay?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.669
Yeah, yeah.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.338
Uh, I used to be
the calm one,

19:33.380 --> 19:36.592
walking you
through the panic attacks.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.679
I'm glad I can finally
return the favor.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.519
So... (sniffles)

19:47.561 --> 19:50.314
Uh...

19:51.773 --> 19:53.901
...what's this plan of yours?

19:53.942 --> 19:56.236
Well, let's just say
it's a good thing

19:56.278 --> 19:59.948
you're her...
sharpest assistant.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.827
You know, I used to have
this recurring dream as a child

20:03.869 --> 20:07.706
that one day I would be wealthy
enough or powerful enough

20:07.748 --> 20:10.959
that I could open
a kind of orphanage

20:11.001 --> 20:14.296
for every magical being
that didn't have parents.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.132
And they would have
a home and a place...

20:17.174 --> 20:18.342
Ah.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.135
How's my world today, Jordan?

20:20.177 --> 20:23.138
Perfect. As always.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.265
Oh.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.100
Oh, excuse me.

20:27.142 --> 20:30.187
Uh, the Big Island menehune
have requested an audience,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
as have the Siberian rusalka.

20:32.105 --> 20:35.108
And here's an offer of tribute
from the elven community.
Oh.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.944
(tray clatters)

20:36.985 --> 20:38.528
Oh!

20:38.570 --> 20:41.615
I am so sorry.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.659
I don't know how that happened.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.953
(exhales)
And here I thought

20:45.994 --> 20:49.456
boxers are supposed to be good
with their hands.
(Jordan chuckles)

20:49.498 --> 20:51.250
Yeah, right?
I mean, of all people,

20:51.291 --> 20:52.709
you wouldn't think
I'd be a butterfinger.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.045
INARA:
Mm.
Uh, here. Let me.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.965
(magical whirring)

20:58.006 --> 20:59.508
(inhales)

21:04.179 --> 21:05.305
There.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.932
Good as new.
(chuckles)

21:06.974 --> 21:08.767
Huh.
Um,

21:08.809 --> 21:10.102
do you need anything else?

21:10.143 --> 21:12.187
No. Thank you.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.315
Good as new.
(laughing)

21:16.275 --> 21:18.068
(whispers):
I'm just gonna...

21:33.875 --> 21:35.877
(magical whirring)

21:36.878 --> 21:38.964
MAGGIE:
Thank you, Abigael.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.431
INARA:
Jordan?

21:47.472 --> 21:48.932
(Jordan grunts)
You know, it turns out

21:48.974 --> 21:51.601
I do need something after all.
Anything.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.770
I need to know
how you got your memory back.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.690
I...

21:56.732 --> 21:58.900
I-I don't know what you're...
INARA:
Well,

21:58.942 --> 22:01.862
you shouldn't have any memory
of being a boxer.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.990
(Jordan grunts)

22:05.032 --> 22:07.284
(Jordan panting)

22:07.326 --> 22:11.830
So, if you remember boxing,
that begs the question...

22:11.872 --> 22:13.749
what else do you remember?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.547
(Jordan grunting)
I'm going to get you
to talk.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.175
The longer you wait,
the more painful it will be.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.509
(electricity zaps)
(Jordan screams)

22:30.098 --> 22:31.558
(brew bubbling)
(chuckles softly)

22:31.600 --> 22:33.352
Listen to that baby purr.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.397
I can't believe we managed
to scrape it all together.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.567
Did you get it?
Yeah.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.778
But Inara got Jordan.
Took him to the command center.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.196
What?

22:44.237 --> 22:45.739
(sighs)
MAGGIE:
I know.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.449
Thank God we have this spell
to get Jordan

22:47.491 --> 22:49.785
and the black amber.
(brew hisses)

22:49.826 --> 22:51.745
What's next?

22:51.787 --> 22:53.663
The last ingredient is desire.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.083
The reason we want to pass
through the door.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.667
To restore our powers.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.628
And put things back
the way they were.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.588
(whispers):
Okay.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.133
Okay.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.138
Craft a key to locks secure,

23:10.180 --> 23:12.391
through any door,
the way assured.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.311
(brew hisses)

23:31.576 --> 23:33.036
Huh?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.206
That's not gonna open any locks.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.419
(Jordan grunting)

23:42.379 --> 23:44.172
How long
have you been like this?

23:44.214 --> 23:47.884
How did you regain your memory?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.053
(Jordan gasping)

23:50.095 --> 23:53.181
If you don't answer me,
I've got no use for you.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.268
Did someone help you wake up?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.145
(grunts)
Yeah.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.063
You did.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.400
By making such a mess
of the world.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.528
I can't believe I didn't
snap out of it sooner.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.655
(gasping)

24:11.199 --> 24:15.454
If there is something wrong
with my world,

24:15.495 --> 24:17.664
you're gonna help me fix it.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.961
You guys must've
messed something up.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.630
Why are you using a
Crock-Pot, anyway?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.132
MEL: Because
we had to improvise

24:27.174 --> 24:29.176
every part of the spell.
MAGGIE:
Oh, great.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.969
So while Jordan and I
were out risking our lives,

24:31.011 --> 24:32.762
you two were here
going off recipe?

24:32.804 --> 24:35.056
Smidge of this,
dash of that?
Well, maybe

24:35.098 --> 24:37.142
you could have done it better
if you hadn't spent

24:37.184 --> 24:38.810
all day getting
one ingredient.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.645
Guys.
MAGGIE:
Oh, let me

24:40.687 --> 24:43.064
just run to the store and grab
a couple pints of demigod blood.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.316
Guys! Hey.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.568
(Mel exhales)
Last time I checked,

24:46.610 --> 24:48.320
Inara was still the bad guy.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.491
(sighs)
We're doing it, aren't we?

24:54.117 --> 24:55.243
We're turning
against each other

24:55.285 --> 24:56.453
like Inara and
her sisters did.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.787
KAELA:
Yes.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.457
We don't want to end up
like them.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.292
(whispers):
No.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.670
Maybe it wasn't the spell
that we got wrong.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.839
Maybe it was our desire.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.508
What do you mean?
(chuckles)

25:09.549 --> 25:11.718
I want the world
to go back to how it was.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.262
The Unseen? The Tallyman?

25:14.304 --> 25:16.598
Fear and helplessness
spreading like a disease?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.016
Things were kind of a mess.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.310
Right.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.395
So what do we want?

25:22.437 --> 25:24.898
We can't go back
to the way things were.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.775
We have to make it better.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.402
For everyone.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.783
I'm in.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.035
Me, too.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.745
(whispers):
All right.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.288
(sighs)

25:44.125 --> 25:45.794
Right. (sighs)

25:47.420 --> 25:50.840
ALL:
Craft a key to locks secure,

25:50.882 --> 25:53.635
through any door,
the way assured.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.680
(brew hisses)

26:03.395 --> 26:05.480
(magical whirring)

26:10.902 --> 26:13.405
(all chuckle)

26:13.446 --> 26:14.990
INARA:
But why would anyone

26:15.031 --> 26:17.033
want to remember
what it was like before?

26:17.075 --> 26:19.244
I've created a world
where magical creatures

26:19.286 --> 26:21.788
are finally free, equal...

26:21.830 --> 26:23.415
Lobotomized.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.625
Watch it.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.503
People feel safe here.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.506
Because you wiped their memories

26:31.548 --> 26:34.092
without their consent.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.011
Let's not even talk
about the humans.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.221
You've seen what humans do
to those who are different.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.432
Coexistence was
never on the table.
You wouldn't know

26:40.473 --> 26:42.601
'cause you
never gave them a chance.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.521
Just like your sisters
didn't give you one.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.858
I am nothing like them.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.319
Don't you judge me!
I'm not.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.029
I'm not.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.241
I think the grief of what your
sisters did has consumed you.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.743
I get it.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.496
But I also think
you know this is all wrong.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.334
You have all the power here.
Why not fix things?

27:07.375 --> 27:08.918
Bring everyone back.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.212
Make a utopia for every...
I can't

27:11.254 --> 27:13.131
undo this.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.466
What?

27:14.507 --> 27:17.135
Even if I wanted to.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.057
The nine, the Unity Bowl,
it was a onetime deal.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.767
No.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.646
What's done is done.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.814
JORDAN:
It can't be reversed?

27:31.191 --> 27:32.484
But...

27:32.525 --> 27:34.944
But that can't be.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.990
What are you not telling me?

27:39.032 --> 27:41.284
What are you hiding?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.286
No. No.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.706
Oh!

27:46.748 --> 27:48.541
(exhales)

27:48.583 --> 27:52.379
Or should I say who?

27:52.420 --> 27:55.340
(exhales)
No. Inara, wait.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.550
No.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.551
Alligatum est!
(glass breaks)

27:58.593 --> 27:59.928
(panting)

28:01.346 --> 28:03.390
JORDAN:
Inara!

28:03.431 --> 28:06.643
(chimes)
Inara, wait! Please.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.187
No! Inara, wait!

28:16.569 --> 28:18.488
Harry.
Harry.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.864
What are you doing back here?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.199
Inara. She's onto you,
and she's coming.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.492
We have to get out of here.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.702
Grab on. Hurry.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.870
(magical whirring)

28:29.874 --> 28:31.710
(screams)

28:34.087 --> 28:35.380
MEL:
What is this place?

28:35.422 --> 28:36.923
Our last hope.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.633
Your plan won't work.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.593
Inara can't
bring humans back,

28:40.635 --> 28:43.012
so stealing her powers
gets you nowhere.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.849
What? How could you
possibly know that?

28:47.100 --> 28:48.935
One of the few perks
of this wretched place:

28:48.977 --> 28:51.563
in addition to VHS copies
of every possible past,

28:51.604 --> 28:53.690
I can also look in
on the present.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.817
(static crackling)

28:57.944 --> 28:59.154
Got to wiggle it.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.030
(groans)
Yeah.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.200
Who the hell is she?

29:04.242 --> 29:06.369
Oh, that's just Diana.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.998
Now, don't mind me.
Just grabbing a snack.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.458
(Harry groans)

29:11.499 --> 29:13.668
Come on, you piece of...

29:13.710 --> 29:16.421
(exhales)
I'm sorry.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.673
You never know
when the volume's gonna work.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.176
Oh, God. Jordan.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.095
What is she doing to him?

29:24.137 --> 29:25.638
Nothing good.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.851
All the more reason
to restore your powers and fast.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.228
If Inara can't fix this,
how can we?

29:33.688 --> 29:34.856
Time travel.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.484
What?

29:37.525 --> 29:39.319
We've done it before.
Why can't we do it again?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.613
We could end up
in medieval times

29:41.654 --> 29:43.448
or-or-or getting eaten
by dinosaurs.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.866
MEL: For the record,
I've worked out

29:44.908 --> 29:46.242
the kinks
since your trip to the '20s.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.869
But it's still a no-go.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.830
We need to know exactly when
and where to go.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.045
And that's where I come in.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.755
I found something

29:58.797 --> 30:01.299
while Jordan was singing
at Dev's memorial.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.803
Do we really have
to watch this again?

30:04.844 --> 30:07.806
I'm afraid so.
Please, just watch.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.019
All right. Right here

30:13.061 --> 30:15.021
as he hits the high note.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.899
(snaps fingers)

30:17.941 --> 30:19.150
But it's just...

30:19.192 --> 30:21.444
Static.
Exactly.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.155
I believe it's a pivot point.
A what?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.366
A point in time where history
can be fundamentally changed.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.409
In that one moment,
the future remains unwritten.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.203
Well, how do you know?
HARRY:
I don't.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.830
Not for sure.
Hence the "last hope."

30:31.871 --> 30:35.375
Look, I have watched
thousands of these tapes,

30:35.416 --> 30:36.668
and they all
end the same way

30:36.709 --> 30:38.169
except this one. I don't believe

30:38.211 --> 30:39.921
that's a coincidence.
MEL:
If you're right,

30:39.963 --> 30:41.464
then this may work.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.800
But we'd have to go back
to that precise moment.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.845
Oh, uh, we can't just go back
a little further,

30:46.886 --> 30:49.806
like... before Dev died?

30:49.848 --> 30:50.890
Macy.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.225
Oh, believe me,

30:52.267 --> 30:53.935
those tapes
were the first I checked.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.938
I watched you save Dev and Macy
in a hundred different ways.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.148
And they all ended badly.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.818
I wish we could
bring them back.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.653
But I'm afraid this is it.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.446
Our one chance.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.156
Then we'll take it.
HARRY:
You just need

31:07.198 --> 31:09.242
to find a way to get Inara
out of the command center.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.828
No easy task,
now that she's onto us.
MAGGIE: You said

31:11.870 --> 31:14.080
these tapes contained footage
of the past, right?

31:14.122 --> 31:16.165

35:58.698 --> 35:59.907
He's not gone.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.952
And neither am I.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.620
Not if you...

36:05.913 --> 36:07.874
If I what? What? What?

36:07.915 --> 36:10.585
If you take my time powers.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.171
You can stop this.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.214
(cracking)

36:15.256 --> 36:17.717
She's too strong.
It's not gonna hold.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.261
I don't know the first thing
about being a time witch.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.387
(crying)

36:22.722 --> 36:24.015
You...

36:24.056 --> 36:25.808
You can stop this.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.394
I know you can.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.573
(crying)

36:43.534 --> 36:45.411
Go. Now.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.664
(whimpering)

36:48.706 --> 36:50.791
Come on.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.758
(Inara grunts)

36:58.799 --> 37:01.135
No!

37:07.558 --> 37:09.393
HARRY:
Now it's just you and me.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.687
INARA:
No. You're wrong.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.398
It's just me.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.085
(panting)

37:34.126 --> 37:35.795
Jordan.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.339
Harry.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.799
(crying):
Mel.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.218
Oh, my God, Mel.
They're gone.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.803
They're really gone.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.429
No.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.807
No, Mel said if we get
to the pivot point,

37:47.848 --> 37:49.350
we can save her.
We can save everyone.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.977
Okay, well, how do we do that?
That's the thing.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.812
I don't know.
I-I'm not a time witch. I...

37:52.853 --> 37:54.188
I don't know the first thing

37:54.230 --> 37:56.023
about sending people back
in time. I...

37:56.065 --> 37:58.109
Mel started with a sandwich.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.570
Maybe we start there, too.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.449
What do you mean?
I mean, if it's too risky

38:05.491 --> 38:06.784
to send ourselves
to the past,

38:06.826 --> 38:08.536
maybe we can send a message

38:08.577 --> 38:10.371
to ourselves in the past.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.998
Everything we need to know.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.583
Everything they need to know.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.168
Everything that's happened.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.724
Mel believes in you.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.351
I believe in you.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.186
You can do this.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.314
(sniffling)

38:39.233 --> 38:40.443
(grunting)

38:44.322 --> 38:45.197
Maggie, she's coming.

38:45.239 --> 38:47.116
(grunting)

38:47.158 --> 38:49.327
I-I can't do it.
No, you can.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.662
You can, okay? Just hurry.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.254
I love you.
I love you, too.
