00:03.364 --> 00:05.704
You'll need to keep
an open mind over this.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.332
Suspend your disbelief.

00:09.164 --> 00:12.699
If I hadn't seen it with my own
eyes, I wouldn't believe it myself.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.984
There are times when I still don't.

00:17.404 --> 00:19.744
This is him before
everything unravelled.

00:19.764 --> 00:21.064
He was happy then.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.186
He didn't need to use it.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.979
If he did, it was
only when he was alone.

00:26.004 --> 00:29.059
Don't let the bugs bite, if
they do, squeeze them tight.

00:33.964 --> 00:35.291
Best boy.

00:39.685 --> 00:41.057
Door, Daddy.

00:42.364 --> 00:45.104
There's nothing in the dark
that's not there in the light, OK?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.940
Let's try and close it
for tonight, see how we go.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.804 --> 01:13.224
I never got the chance to
ask him when the bad stuff kicked off.

01:16.524 --> 01:18.864
If something in particular triggered it.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.979
Maybe he can't remember himself.

01:24.277 --> 01:27.170
Or the memory of it is
too scary to think about.

01:27.964 --> 01:31.100
He's not big on talking
about anything personal.

01:32.044 --> 01:34.654
In that way, at least,
he's like any other boy.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.064
Stop lying to me...

02:04.924 --> 02:07.939
What the hell were you
thinking, throwing that?!

02:08.324 --> 02:10.289
You could have killed us!

02:25.375 --> 02:27.875
Maybe it doesn't
matter where it starts, anyway.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.372
Only where it ends.

02:46.432 --> 02:49.712
Can't you read? Under 14s only.

03:11.204 --> 03:13.304
Couldn't Victor look after him?

03:13.884 --> 03:15.880
He's at work, isn't he?

03:19.644 --> 03:21.732
He's cutting it fine again.

03:26.204 --> 03:27.549
As ever.

03:55.991 --> 03:58.559
He knows it's today. I
reminded him this morning.

04:00.004 --> 04:02.163
Yeah, er... we'd best... press on.

04:03.684 --> 04:06.447
Apparently when your son
first went to secondary school,

04:06.472 --> 04:08.291
he was a real high-flier.

04:08.983 --> 04:12.111
"Bordering on exceptional",
his year teacher said.

04:13.084 --> 04:15.616
Well, our divorce
derailed him for a while.

04:15.641 --> 04:19.298
Yeah, but that was, what,
four, five years ago?

04:20.438 --> 04:25.147
He's a bright lad with real potential
but he's running out of road.

04:45.524 --> 04:47.960
Why were we not told
about all this before?

04:47.985 --> 04:49.992
Well, that's why I've called
this meeting, Dr Jarrett,

04:50.016 --> 04:52.704
to do just that, to
alert you to our concerns.

04:52.729 --> 04:55.539
Mister. I'm a surgeon.

04:55.564 --> 04:57.935
Only physicians are called doctors.

04:58.764 --> 04:59.764
Right.

05:01.182 --> 05:04.220
No other personal problems we
should be aware of, are there?

05:04.404 --> 05:07.626
Girlfriend issues,
drugs, cyber bullying...?

05:09.492 --> 05:11.589
Well, there is something
going on with him.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.584
He was a head-banger when he was small.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.464
If he was frustrated or frightened,

05:16.489 --> 05:19.081
he'd just crawl to a wall
and bang his head on it.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.682
That was light years ago.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.460
Light years.

05:27.404 --> 05:29.323
"Change the narrative."

05:29.324 --> 05:31.475
Where do they get this crap from?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.579
Management-speak for dummies.

05:33.611 --> 05:36.394
No, he's right. We need
to intervene, like he said.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.984
We need to do something.

05:38.009 --> 05:39.988
Now I can't reach him. I've tried.

05:40.013 --> 05:41.707
He just shuts down.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.105
Could send him back to the psychiatrist.

05:44.568 --> 05:45.700
Maybe he could get through to him?

05:45.724 --> 05:49.158
You can't outsource it this time,
Ed. You need to take him on yourself.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.113
You need to tackle him on it.

05:51.564 --> 05:54.078
- What, like he's gonna listen to me?
- Yeah, well,

05:54.103 --> 05:56.815
if you stop pussy-footing around him
trying to be his friend, he might.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.220
You're his father.

05:58.684 --> 06:01.394
And that's your "Get out of jail" card.

06:26.641 --> 06:29.372
Do you wanna stop off
somewhere, grab a burger?

06:31.577 --> 06:33.917
It's not like you to pass up free nosh.

06:35.524 --> 06:38.768
So, erm, where
were you? The report meeting?

06:39.044 --> 06:42.745
Just leave that a minute, OK?
There's stuff we need to talk about.

06:43.044 --> 06:46.294
He says you're getting behind in
your college work. Seriously behind.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.575
What's this about bunking off again?
Thought we were through all that.

06:52.604 --> 06:56.697
Even on the rare occasions you do
show, he says you're disengaged.

06:57.437 --> 06:58.737
Disconnected.

06:58.804 --> 07:00.658
I said, put it away!

07:02.964 --> 07:05.493
Turn the damn thing off and put it away.

07:07.804 --> 07:10.144
Your GCSEs were lacklustre,
to say the least,

07:10.169 --> 07:13.224
and if you've any hope of decent
A-levels you'd better shape up.

07:13.249 --> 07:16.342
Stop bunking off whenever
the feeling takes you.

07:16.804 --> 07:21.444
If you're not at college all day,
what do you do? Where do you go?

07:22.924 --> 07:25.264
If you wanna screw up your
future, then that's fine,

07:25.284 --> 07:28.024
you're going the right way about
it. You are fast-tracking it.

07:28.049 --> 07:31.222
We agreed to stop the therapy on
condition you delivered your end.

07:31.247 --> 07:35.640
Focus on your studies. Stop copping
out, smoking dope and the rest of it.

07:35.884 --> 07:38.304
I've other responsibilities
now, other mouths to feed.

07:38.329 --> 07:40.504
Your step-brother, twins on the way.

07:40.536 --> 07:42.231
Look, you're not a kid any more.

07:42.852 --> 07:46.411
Shit happens. You can't just
go round it, you have to...

07:46.777 --> 07:48.928
you have to go through it,
you have to deal with it.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.724
Every turn in the divorce,

07:50.748 --> 07:52.128
we made you the priority.

07:52.153 --> 07:56.309
We put you first every turn. Same
school, same house, same friends.

07:56.465 --> 08:00.903
If your life were a cake,
only one slice got changed...

08:00.928 --> 08:02.188
and I...

08:02.212 --> 08:04.288
I am through apologising for that.

08:05.030 --> 08:06.367
Can't you do something about him?

08:06.391 --> 08:08.208
I can't find his dummy.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.827
Things are gonna change now, OK? And
until they do, the bank is closed.

08:13.004 --> 08:16.757
Forget your allowance, forget your
driving licence, your mobile bill...

08:47.810 --> 08:49.880
God.

08:53.170 --> 08:56.286
Darling. Shh.

08:56.341 --> 08:58.239
It's OK, sweetheart.

08:58.264 --> 09:00.512
Shush, shush.

09:02.010 --> 09:04.209
Darling.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.110
- You can't have closed it properly.
- Yeah, it's my fault, of course.

09:07.135 --> 09:09.614
- I'm just saying to you. Ssh.
- Well, don't.

09:09.639 --> 09:13.278
Now is not the time,
OK? Accidents happen.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.247
No-one is to blame.

09:15.684 --> 09:16.793
Are you hurt?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.599
Shush, shush.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.419
Where the hell do you
think you're going?!

09:36.330 --> 09:38.670
"This is
the Pellway Therapy Centre."

09:38.850 --> 09:41.998
"Please leave your name
and number after the tone."

09:50.050 --> 09:52.213
Ross Brodie. Can I help you?

09:53.577 --> 09:54.877
Hello?

09:56.275 --> 09:57.548
Hello?

09:58.970 --> 10:00.990
Hello?

10:27.290 --> 10:28.449
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

11:23.618 --> 11:26.180
Every turn in the divorce
we made you the priority.

11:26.206 --> 11:29.990
You're not a kid anymore. If your life
were a cake, only one slice got changed.

12:14.130 --> 12:17.044
We should phone Ed again.
Maybe he's turned up now.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.861
He'd have called if he had.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.870
Come to bed. Come on.

12:35.890 --> 12:38.689
Taking off like that.
What the hell got into him?

12:39.272 --> 12:41.673
What if you or Christopher
had been hurt or...?

12:43.795 --> 12:46.381
There was a time I used to
know everything he was thinking,

12:46.412 --> 12:48.013
even before he did.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.836
Do you think it's about
Faith moving in with us?

12:59.970 --> 13:04.250
Well... a new baby brother to
contend with, and now his step-sister?

13:04.610 --> 13:07.094
He's 17 years old, Hannah.

13:08.410 --> 13:11.185
You climb into the sandpit with
him, you stoop to his level.

13:14.214 --> 13:18.511
He needs boundaries.
Discipline. Today proves it.

13:22.610 --> 13:24.649
We tried the softly, softly thing.

13:24.650 --> 13:27.034
Come on, Christopher.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.245
My best boy.

13:31.330 --> 13:34.542
And now his father's finally stepping
up, we must follow through, too.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.232
Hallelujah!

13:57.592 --> 14:00.646
He's back! Where have
you been all this time?

14:01.170 --> 14:04.470
Your mother's been off her head with
worry. Could you not have rung, texted?

14:04.495 --> 14:05.910
No battery.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.535
Leave it to me, OK? We'll be fine.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.469
What you did today...

14:21.494 --> 14:24.330
the way you lit off after the accident,
abandoning your mother and brother.

14:24.354 --> 14:26.078
What sort of person
does something like that?

14:26.102 --> 14:29.477
- Dad was there.
- They're not his responsibility.

14:30.210 --> 14:32.350
Starting now, you're
getting your act together.

14:32.382 --> 14:34.436
Whatever's going on
with you at school...

14:34.461 --> 14:35.665
College.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.344
It's a sixth form college.

14:37.370 --> 14:40.578
It's over. As of now, all the crap ends.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.878
No more zoning out on
your computer games,

14:42.903 --> 14:44.894
skulking round town
doing God knows what.

14:44.919 --> 14:47.730
And before you say I'm not your father,
I've no right to lay down the law,

14:47.754 --> 14:49.542
my daughter's coming
to live in this house,

14:49.567 --> 14:52.253
and I'm her father, and
that gives me the right.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.036
She's been through enough these
past weeks, losing her mother...

14:55.060 --> 14:57.222
If her life were a cake.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.073
Isn't this to be the baby's room?

15:03.290 --> 15:05.529
You can't keep him there
with you forever, can you?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.790
Hang about.

15:10.294 --> 15:11.594
Now I get it.

15:13.770 --> 15:15.793
All that shit about me pulling
my finger out at college,

15:15.817 --> 15:18.409
before I screw up my future,

15:18.542 --> 15:20.557
screw up my chance of uni.

15:21.970 --> 15:23.750
So my room's freed up.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.329
Problem solved.

15:26.330 --> 15:27.630
Isn't there some rule?

15:28.405 --> 15:29.865
The last one in is first out.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.823
From now on, I make the rules.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.931
I've taken a back seat with you,
but that's also gonna change.

15:34.956 --> 15:36.402
Your mother may be
blind to the guilt trips

15:36.426 --> 15:39.300
and the "poor misunderstood"
crap you pull, but I'm not.

15:39.325 --> 15:41.362
It's tiresome and immature.

15:41.596 --> 15:44.206
So do us all a favour and get over it.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.761
Get some sleep.

16:58.330 --> 16:59.971
Your packed lunch.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.557
It's in the fridge.

17:13.089 --> 17:15.717
You are going in today, to college?

17:16.170 --> 17:18.803
Call them. Check if you want.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.790
You gave it me as a present.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.837
Remember?

17:31.672 --> 17:34.833
You found it on that beach
in Dorset that weekend.

17:35.394 --> 17:37.755
When we went just after your dad left.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.419
When the seagulls came and
nicked our packed lunch.

17:41.443 --> 17:42.692
Yeah.

17:43.527 --> 17:46.309
And it rained all that
first day, remember?

17:46.970 --> 17:50.828
You did those magic tricks
in the B&B to keep us amused.

17:54.850 --> 17:56.640
Is it to punish me?

17:57.342 --> 17:59.390
When you act out and...

18:00.330 --> 18:02.127
Is it to punish me?

18:02.810 --> 18:05.150
For Victor... the baby?

18:06.894 --> 18:09.514
They were precious to me, too,
those years we had together.

18:09.730 --> 18:12.251
After the divorce, before I met Victor.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.350
You know that.

18:15.133 --> 18:16.220
But...

18:17.635 --> 18:20.185
I couldn't put my life on hold forever.

18:20.334 --> 18:22.915
And when you're ready to get
on with yours, you can do it,

18:22.940 --> 18:25.328
knowing that you don't
have to worry about me.

18:25.353 --> 18:27.421
I'm not alone anymore.

18:28.290 --> 18:29.851
It was for the best.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.179
I did the right thing.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.320
Duty calls.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.425
OK, so Hardy wanted to
explore the complexities

19:18.450 --> 19:21.383
of what it means to be
human. How did he do that?

19:24.450 --> 19:29.192
He did that by revealing the
internal lives of his characters.

19:29.217 --> 19:33.293
Those emotional forces
that govern all our actions.

19:33.810 --> 19:35.790
His recurring themes were what?

19:36.530 --> 19:38.067
Sex?

19:38.092 --> 19:42.745
Yeah. Among other things,
like, er, loss and betrayal.

19:42.770 --> 19:46.783
The whole
spectrum of human suffering.

19:46.808 --> 19:50.161
His work reflects his
cataclysmic sense of tragedy...

20:30.890 --> 20:33.077
- Hey, Bro.
- Hi.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.130
Come on.

20:40.970 --> 20:43.129
Oi!

20:58.810 --> 21:00.549
Finished your homework?

21:00.690 --> 21:03.570
- Time for piano practice, then.
- We're going to play Minecraft.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.335
Just throwing good money after bad
for lessons if you don't practice.

21:09.482 --> 21:11.771
- What time's Dad home?
- Late.

21:11.796 --> 21:13.437
Tonight's his
outpatients clinic.

21:14.764 --> 21:17.024
Something in particular
you wanted to see him for?

21:23.410 --> 21:26.796
Doesn't it weird you out? Having
two of them kicking inside you?

21:26.821 --> 21:29.598
- Why on earth should it?
- They get hiccups, too.

21:29.970 --> 21:33.410
- They do, you said. And they fart.
- Jack.

21:33.435 --> 21:36.588
- Everybody farts, don't they?
- Maybe they do it in sync, being twins.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.689
Enough.

21:42.690 --> 21:44.497
Enough, I said.

21:47.530 --> 21:49.630
Go start your practice.

22:59.890 --> 23:02.129
It's supposed to be Wednesdays he comes.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.711
Every second Wednesday and
the first weekend of the month.

23:04.736 --> 23:07.413
It doesn't have to be
set in stone, does it?

23:07.570 --> 23:09.350
He reeks of weed.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.230
I can smell it on him.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.030
And I don't want Jack
exposed to his excesses.

23:16.389 --> 23:17.689
Excesses?

23:18.857 --> 23:22.259
Well, you said yourself the
other day, he's out of control.

23:24.010 --> 23:26.986
You're not responsible for
how he's turning out, Ed.

23:27.308 --> 23:28.968
You think you are, but you're not.

23:29.322 --> 23:32.088
And divorce is hardly a
novelty these days, is it?

23:37.410 --> 23:38.748
Talk to him.

24:50.997 --> 24:53.910
- Is it OK to see Mrs Jarrett?
- You'll make her day.

24:54.732 --> 24:56.567
I think she's presentable.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.889
Thank you.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.630
You have a very important job...

25:01.655 --> 25:05.771
Can you change the channel?
We're missing our cookery programme.

25:06.286 --> 25:08.935
We need to change the channel

25:08.959 --> 25:11.162
for our cookery programme.

25:11.334 --> 25:13.910
You know the way.

25:18.890 --> 25:20.750
The starlings are back.

25:21.490 --> 25:22.950
Thousands of them.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.289
Turned the sky black.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.713
I'd like to have seen that.

25:28.856 --> 25:30.502
How are things at home?

25:32.057 --> 25:33.260
Which one?

25:37.690 --> 25:39.533
It's happening again, Gran.

25:40.410 --> 25:42.270
Tell me.

25:45.854 --> 25:48.469
It's like it... takes me over.

25:48.970 --> 25:50.809
Makes me do things.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.105
You have to control it.

25:53.295 --> 25:54.595
You must.

25:55.450 --> 25:58.097
Your grandfather lost control and...

25:59.330 --> 26:00.839
And what?

26:01.410 --> 26:04.024
Why won't anyone ever talk
about what happened to him?

26:04.130 --> 26:06.360
The past is best left in the past.

26:07.010 --> 26:08.743
Except it's not in the past.

26:09.297 --> 26:10.597
Is it?

26:16.130 --> 26:17.990
I even look like him.

26:20.770 --> 26:22.714
How come Dad didn't get it?

26:23.810 --> 26:27.597
Told you. It skipped a generation.
Often the way with these things.

26:28.450 --> 26:30.019
Went to see him yesterday.

26:30.970 --> 26:32.790
To talk to him about it.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.419
Try, anyway.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.654
You know how he is.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.185
He only sees what he wants to see.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.110
All families have secrets.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.910
And this is ours.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.630
Anything you need? Coffee or...?

26:53.283 --> 26:54.763
I have to go.

26:58.290 --> 27:00.169
Never use it in anger.

27:00.506 --> 27:02.826
That way you can control it.

27:03.864 --> 27:05.638
Only use it for good.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.826
Only for good.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.282
Please, we need
to change the channel.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.710
She never listens.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.750
With a little bit of olive oil. OK?

27:37.530 --> 27:40.822
And then, you just pick it up
and you pour it into the spices...

27:41.430 --> 27:43.595
It's on! It's on!

27:43.650 --> 27:45.790
I'm just washing my hands.

27:56.050 --> 27:58.390
Please, God, not again.

28:09.612 --> 28:11.952
Here we go. You all right?

28:15.721 --> 28:18.232
- Hey.
- She's here...

28:25.054 --> 28:27.512
He told me later that
what happened would have happened,

28:27.536 --> 28:29.284
even if I'd never come into his life.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.932
- There's your sister.
- I'm not so sure.

28:32.541 --> 28:36.641
I think we all touch each other's
lives in ways we may never know.

28:45.125 --> 28:47.836
I remembered lilac was
your favourite colour, see?

28:52.252 --> 28:54.166
Heating comes on at...

28:55.127 --> 28:57.512
seven till ten in the mornings.

28:58.213 --> 29:00.473
Five o'clock till nine at night.

29:01.094 --> 29:02.816
If you get cold, we've got
a spare fan heater we can...

29:02.840 --> 29:04.447
It's fine, Dad.

29:06.174 --> 29:07.474
Come here.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.635
Losing your mum to cancer.

29:12.374 --> 29:14.354
You've been down and back.

29:17.774 --> 29:19.366
When you moved up
north with your mother,

29:19.390 --> 29:21.754
I know we didn't see
each other as much as...

29:21.774 --> 29:25.225
Then the baby came
and... I was needed here.

29:25.969 --> 29:29.302
You were always in my
thoughts and prayers. Always.

29:30.442 --> 29:33.193
I love you. I never stopped.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.294
- If you need a hand with...
- I'm good.

29:46.215 --> 29:47.848
This is a new start for us.

30:23.933 --> 30:27.739
So, erm... when was the
last time you two met?

30:28.534 --> 30:31.716
Two years ago. At your wedding.

30:32.982 --> 30:35.453
Prettiest of all the
bridesmaids, bar none.

30:35.454 --> 30:37.474
A lot's happened since then.

30:45.746 --> 30:47.360
Not at the table.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.554
I spoke to your head of
year at the college, erm...

30:55.241 --> 30:56.733
Mr Blake, is it?

30:57.494 --> 30:58.794
It's Blakeston.

31:00.014 --> 31:02.452
He said to take the time
you need before you start.

31:02.670 --> 31:04.714
- Whenever you're ready, he said.
- I am ready.

31:04.754 --> 31:06.840
Four A-levels she's taking.

31:06.894 --> 31:09.496
Predicted A-Stars in all of them.

31:10.694 --> 31:13.034
Good job you didn't take
after your old man?

31:13.094 --> 31:15.598
Well, college is a
ten-minute bus ride away.

31:16.334 --> 31:18.855
Your brother can show you the
way, show you the ropes there.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.221
Step-brother.

31:21.045 --> 31:24.801
Half-brother, step-brother, we're
all the same family now, aren't we?

31:26.054 --> 31:27.824
Amen to that.

31:32.894 --> 31:35.234
Shush, shush.

32:56.094 --> 32:57.423
You sure you don't
want a lift? No trouble.

32:57.447 --> 32:58.818
I'm good, thanks.

32:59.148 --> 33:01.578
Text me how you get on, if
there's any problems or...

33:01.625 --> 33:04.086
you want a ride home, no... trouble.

33:06.534 --> 33:09.029
Here you go. It's coming next week.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.258
Can you even ride a scooter?

33:10.283 --> 33:12.603
- I passed my test last summer.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

33:12.974 --> 33:15.234
- What's good?
- Hey.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.954
Who's the newbie? You're
not gonna introduce us?

33:22.558 --> 33:24.181
My step-sister. Faith.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.909
Jamie. Azfal, Malik, Kylie.

33:29.042 --> 33:30.342
Hi.

33:31.054 --> 33:34.339
So, er... Faith, you seen
any of his magic tricks yet?

33:35.614 --> 33:37.634
Hey, man, show her.

33:41.174 --> 33:42.669
Sick, innit?

33:44.857 --> 33:46.560
I know that one.

33:47.414 --> 33:49.093
It's on YouTube.

33:49.118 --> 33:53.266
You put a hole in the side of the
cup and then you use your thumb to...

33:55.218 --> 33:56.336
Is it static?

33:56.361 --> 33:59.086
- He never tells us.
- Apparently it's a trade-secret.

33:59.268 --> 34:01.492
It's too sick, bruv.
Know what I'm saying?

34:01.530 --> 34:03.608
You know what? Do the
shoelace one. Check this out.

34:03.633 --> 34:07.218
Go on, bruv. She wants to see. Go on.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.274
Insane, Bruv.

34:17.518 --> 34:18.818
Do the other one.

34:27.291 --> 34:29.714
Dynamo!

34:47.730 --> 34:50.661
- What's your first class?
- Psychology.

34:51.174 --> 34:53.475
But I've got register
at the office first.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.746
Admin's down the corridor.

34:56.813 --> 34:57.973
Catch you later.

35:21.134 --> 35:23.812
Do you hate her? My mother?

35:23.956 --> 35:25.790
For taking your dad off yours?

35:27.054 --> 35:29.004
I mean, I get it if you do. I...

35:29.254 --> 35:33.113
Maybe back in the day, I did.

35:33.894 --> 35:36.684
- And now?
- We are where we are.

35:39.734 --> 35:41.314
Do you...

35:42.334 --> 35:45.965
hate your... stepmother
for going off with your dad?

35:48.353 --> 35:49.918
I have my moments.

35:51.841 --> 35:54.395
Hate the sin, not the sinner.

35:55.134 --> 35:57.770
Dad text me that after he left.

35:58.934 --> 36:00.746
It's easy to say.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.540
My God.

36:06.974 --> 36:08.274
Look.

36:20.294 --> 36:22.224
It's so beautiful.

36:25.054 --> 36:26.325
Yeah.

37:36.323 --> 37:38.025
Come on in.

37:49.403 --> 37:53.687
So, what, it's been...
er... a year now since we...

37:56.580 --> 37:58.040
So what's been going on?

38:00.083 --> 38:01.732
That's new.

38:02.243 --> 38:04.063
Yeah.

38:04.643 --> 38:06.217
I'm all hi-tech now.

38:07.163 --> 38:09.873
Just for my records, training, etcetera.

38:12.283 --> 38:14.420
Your mum's had the baby, I take it?

38:15.083 --> 38:16.287
A boy.

38:18.083 --> 38:20.999
And things OK with your
stepfather? Victor, isn't it?

38:23.223 --> 38:24.757
And your dad?

38:26.843 --> 38:29.765
How about college? Things
working out better now?

38:32.203 --> 38:35.515
So... everything is A-OK.

38:37.603 --> 38:39.218
Yet here you are.

38:43.158 --> 38:45.458
I... I want to be more in control.

38:46.843 --> 38:48.882
I get angry sometimes.

38:48.883 --> 38:51.103
I lose it. Do things.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.082
- What kind of things?
- Just stuff.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.383
Like what?

38:56.963 --> 39:00.287
Do you try using any of the anger
management strategies we talked about?

39:00.363 --> 39:01.803
She's having twins.

39:03.403 --> 39:04.751
Beth.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.531
My... my dad...

39:08.803 --> 39:10.562
my stepmother.

39:10.930 --> 39:12.230
Wow.

39:13.696 --> 39:16.036
Babies on all fronts, then.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.123
You used to say that
you were... stuck...

39:22.363 --> 39:25.092
like a stalled engine,
you said. Do you remember?

39:25.283 --> 39:29.154
And... you know, here we are a year on.

39:30.003 --> 39:33.898
Most guys your age are focusing
on things outside the family.

39:33.923 --> 39:36.379
Hanging out with friends,
figuring out their future...

39:36.404 --> 39:38.130
My step-sister's moved in with us.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.568
She's started at my college and...

39:41.363 --> 39:42.663
Is she your age?

39:44.083 --> 39:46.083
You like her.

39:49.203 --> 39:52.044
Like... you know, more than a sister?

39:56.963 --> 39:59.898
And what, you think
that that's unnatural?

39:59.923 --> 40:03.172
- Well, it can't go anywhere, can it?
- Do you want it to go somewhere?

40:05.003 --> 40:07.967
- Don't want it not to.
- You told her how you feel?

40:08.283 --> 40:09.842
Told anyone?

40:10.758 --> 40:12.826
You used to be able to
talk to your grandmother.

40:12.851 --> 40:14.241
Not about this.

40:14.367 --> 40:15.700
What about your dad?

40:17.563 --> 40:19.762
Give him a chance. Why not?

40:19.763 --> 40:21.477
Build some bridges.

40:22.443 --> 40:24.983
Maybe even think about moving
into his place for a while.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.281
It would take the heat out
of things at home for a bit.

40:27.578 --> 40:29.000
I don't know.

40:29.456 --> 40:30.898
He might surprise you.

41:15.374 --> 41:18.471
- Ooh!
- Sorry. Did I...?

41:18.737 --> 41:20.299
You scared the hell out of me.

41:22.483 --> 41:24.722
- What time's Dad home?
- Six.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.400
Yeah. Wait for him in
the study if you want.

41:29.603 --> 41:31.082
Is Jack about?

41:31.083 --> 41:32.979
He has karate on Thursdays.

41:41.883 --> 41:44.716
That is seriously good.

41:47.483 --> 41:49.322
There's something we need to, erm...

41:50.655 --> 41:54.658
er... yeah, the way you drift
in and out whenever you want.

41:56.525 --> 41:58.122
It has to, er...

41:58.123 --> 42:01.572
Contact is every second Wednesday
and the first weekend of the month.

42:01.597 --> 42:04.103
That was the arrangement.

42:04.123 --> 42:06.263
In a month or so, the
babies are gonna be here,

42:06.288 --> 42:09.073
and I'll have my hands full just
getting through the day without...

42:11.594 --> 42:14.983
They say the demands of twins can have
an adverse effect on other siblings

42:15.008 --> 42:17.773
and any spare time we
have, it has to be for Jack.

42:18.164 --> 42:21.187
I don't want him feeling
like he's been replaced.

42:24.363 --> 42:26.912
Well, it's not like you
had no choice, is it?

42:27.373 --> 42:29.585
When your father left, we asked
if you wanted to live with us

42:29.609 --> 42:30.648
but you were adamant to
stay with your mother.

42:30.672 --> 42:32.107
Well, she was alone.

42:32.155 --> 42:33.357
And now she's not.

42:34.179 --> 42:36.390
She's moved on, like the rest of us.

42:36.843 --> 42:39.143
The only person who refuses to...

42:42.363 --> 42:45.778
You're an adult now. It's
time to take responsibility.

42:46.021 --> 42:48.188
Join the real world like the rest of us.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.545
Are you stoned?

42:53.083 --> 42:54.760
Stoned is old school.

42:55.098 --> 42:57.674
- No-one says that anymore.
- I'll take that as a yes.

42:57.837 --> 42:59.856
If you wanna go off the
rails, that's your choice, too.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.128
But I'm not having you do it here.

43:01.152 --> 43:03.393
God knows why Jack looks
up to you, but he does.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.778
Stoned synonyms.

43:05.013 --> 43:09.062
Blasted, blitzed, bombed,
fried, high, loaded.

43:09.763 --> 43:12.070
Some of these could be about booze
as much as they're about weed.

43:12.094 --> 43:13.258
But you get the...

43:13.501 --> 43:17.875
Ripped, spaced out, strung out,
wasted, zonked, smashed, trashed,

43:17.900 --> 43:19.938
blasted, hammered, tripping, whacked...

43:19.963 --> 43:22.016
You just can't help yourself, can you?

43:22.123 --> 43:24.258
Do you have any idea
how you make him feel?

43:24.283 --> 43:26.855
How you hurt him, acting as you do?

43:27.243 --> 43:29.754
He thinks he's failed you as a father.

43:29.916 --> 43:33.246
Now I'm not standing by while
you put him through this any more.

43:34.963 --> 43:37.223
He doesn't deserve it.

43:39.372 --> 43:40.914
Key.

43:49.963 --> 43:53.547
I'll tell your father you called
by. Please think about what I said.

44:25.683 --> 44:27.995
Without question, having twins...

44:44.302 --> 44:47.562
Just want you to relax
and take a deep breath...

45:22.203 --> 45:23.682
Aaagh!

45:43.123 --> 45:45.282
That's when it really kicked off.

45:45.704 --> 45:48.044
He'd tasted his power now...

45:48.923 --> 45:51.183
and he wanted more of it.
