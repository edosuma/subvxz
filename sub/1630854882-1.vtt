pieces of fucking flare on.

11:18.030 --> 11:20.730
Did we not have the flair pin talk?

Jen from "Office Space"?

19 pieces of fucking flair on.

13:14.790 --> 13:17.700
A dollar? (laughs)

13:17.700 --> 13:20.133
Yeah, I know, it was pretty good.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.973
What, can I have a few pieces of that?

13:25.170 --> 13:27.360
- Let me ask you a question.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.860
Does your dick touch your ass?

13:30.813 --> 13:31.646
(Collin laughs)

13:31.646 --> 13:32.730
- No.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.330
- Then you can't have any candy.

13:37.423 --> 13:40.090
(scanner beeps)

13:41.191 --> 13:43.770
- Okay, that'll be 46.50.

13:43.770 --> 13:45.870
How many bags do you want?

13:45.870 --> 13:47.313
- I don't need any bags.

13:50.107 --> 13:50.940
(register beeps)

13:50.940 --> 13:52.510
- Sorry, your card was declined.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.953
- Oh, I have another, I think.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.353
Yeah, here, here it is.

13:59.911 --> 14:00.744
- Okay.

14:02.700 --> 14:03.570
- [Man In Line] Come on.

14:03.570 --> 14:06.237
- I'm not getting any younger here.

14:06.237 --> 14:07.070
(register beeps)

14:07.070 --> 14:08.230
- Do you have another option?

14:09.810 --> 14:11.310
- I know what's going on here.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.440
- Ma'am, I'm just trying to ring people up

14:13.440 --> 14:15.210
with five items or less.

14:15.210 --> 14:19.020
- I'm done here, Collin! (snaps)

14:19.020 --> 14:21.767
- Mommy, is everything okay?

14:26.010 --> 14:27.843
You, (snaps) floor, now.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.997
Come on, (snaps) Cindy, register.

14:31.997 --> 14:32.830
(ominous orchestral music)

14:32.830 --> 14:34.405
- How much is this?

14:34.405 --> 14:35.605
- It's a dollar.

14:35.605 --> 14:36.866
- How much is this?

14:36.866 --> 14:37.825
- It's a dollar.

14:37.825 --> 14:38.719
- How much is this?

14:38.719 --> 14:39.552
- It's a dollar.

14:39.552 --> 14:40.385
- How much is this?

14:40.385 --> 14:41.710
- It's a dollar.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.293
- Hey, hey, how much are these?

14:45.490 --> 14:47.035
Everything's just a dollar?

14:47.035 --> 14:49.120
Oh, man, heck, yeah.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.441
- How much is this?

14:50.441 --> 14:51.358
- A dollar.

14:52.373 --> 14:53.913
- What if I buy four?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.663
- It's gonna be four fucking dollars.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.123
- Amy.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.163
Amy?

15:05.910 --> 15:06.743
Amy.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.870
There she is, there you are. (laughs)

15:12.870 --> 15:14.523
You're scaring the customers.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.300
- Oh, sorry.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.000
- Hey, everyone, it's
okay, it's all right.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.280
Here's what we're gonna do, all right?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.590
You're just gonna take
the rest of the day off.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.680
You're gonna come back in tomorrow, okay?

15:28.680 --> 15:31.653
Wait, how many fingers am I holding up?

15:33.145 --> 15:34.510
- 10.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.480
- Good, 10, that's right.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.460
That's good, that's how
many pieces of flair

15:38.460 --> 15:40.740
you're gonna wear tomorrow
when you come in, okay?

15:40.740 --> 15:45.385
Not five, 10 pieces of flair, all right?

15:45.385 --> 15:48.480
Okay, good, good, okay.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.980
All right, (laughs) all right.

15:57.795 --> 15:58.628
- Girl.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.375
I think the stress is getting to you.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.208
- Yeah.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.520
- Take the day and relax, all right?

16:06.520 --> 16:09.853
(slow meditative music)

16:27.327 --> 16:28.747
- You can come back now.

17:02.096 --> 17:04.513
(man snores)

17:09.852 --> 17:12.269
(man snores)

17:36.327 --> 17:38.660

17:42.832 --> 17:47.237

17:47.237 --> 17:49.710
Hoff's on home plate, Sarkozy jumps-

17:49.710 --> 17:53.161
- Hey, baby mama.
- Oh my goodness, hello.

17:53.161 --> 17:53.994
Ugh.

17:53.994 --> 17:54.827
- Yeah?

17:56.580 --> 17:57.750
How's she doing?

17:57.750 --> 17:59.340
- [Mary] Good, we're tired.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.263
- [Tommy] Hmm, shopping?

18:02.430 --> 18:03.263
- No.

18:03.263 --> 18:04.096
- Yes.

18:04.096 --> 18:04.980
- Yes?

18:04.980 --> 18:06.540
- That was a yes no, right there.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.390
- It was, I only went to a couple stores.

18:09.390 --> 18:10.380
- Oh, a couple?

18:10.380 --> 18:11.213
- Yeah.

18:11.213 --> 18:13.440
- We gonna talk about
what stores these were?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.609
- No, I would rather talk about your day.

18:15.609 --> 18:18.080
- Ah, I bet, okay, my day, huh?

18:18.080 --> 18:18.990
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.990 --> 18:19.823
- How was my day?

18:19.823 --> 18:21.059
- Yes.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.640
- Uh, my day, uh, ooh,
okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.900
I had a student projectile
vomit on my shoes today.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.420
What was the best part of y'all's day?

18:30.420 --> 18:34.260
- Ooh, if everything goes as planned,

18:34.260 --> 18:36.179
I'm gonna get my bank loan tomorrow.

18:36.179 --> 18:37.619
- Yo, for real?

18:37.619 --> 18:38.452
- Yeah.

18:38.452 --> 18:41.684
- Ah, I see you, babe,
way to go, good job.

18:41.684 --> 18:44.624
- Thank you, so 'tis that time.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.457
- Hmm.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.478
- I need baby names.

18:46.478 --> 18:48.368
- Baby names, for the baby?

18:48.368 --> 18:49.620
- Yeah, yeah, no, for the dog.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.710
What do you mean, yeah.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.623
- Yeah, I think we have Zoe.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.350
- Okay.

18:55.350 --> 18:56.952
- Kelly,

18:56.952 --> 18:57.902
which, which, which

18:59.430 --> 19:00.960
spinner fingers are you feeling right now?

19:00.960 --> 19:01.793
Zoe or Kelly?

19:02.970 --> 19:04.350
- You know, we have a few
more months, it's fine.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.180
We'll, we'll figure it out.

19:06.180 --> 19:07.350
- Do you like those though, right?

19:07.350 --> 19:08.183
- Yeah, I like them.

19:08.183 --> 19:09.016
- They're great.

19:09.016 --> 19:10.590
- I like them, um-

19:10.590 --> 19:13.200
- [Tommy] Well, what was
the worst part of your day?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.693
- Hmm, probably seeing Ames.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.360
I don't know, she's, she's
definitely had a rough go

19:21.360 --> 19:22.720
of it since Dad died, but

19:24.030 --> 19:26.330
I don't know, just
sister's intuition tells me

19:27.339 --> 19:29.343
that something else is going on.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.580
- Yeah, it takes time.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.453
You know, people, people
heal on their own schedules.

19:41.697 --> 19:44.614
- Yeah, yeah, I know, you're right.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.563
- Yeah, she'll be back to her
old self someday soon, babe.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.100
- Well, in the meantime,

19:53.100 --> 19:56.937
I guess we can binge watch
some "90 Day Fiance."

19:56.937 --> 19:58.260
- Oh, yeah.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.093
- Or "Hoarders."

19:59.093 --> 20:00.717
- Mm, okay, that's cool, yeah.

20:00.717 --> 20:01.897
Which one do you want to watch?

20:01.897 --> 20:02.870
- "90 Day Fiance."

20:02.870 --> 20:05.160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, me
too, me too, me too.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.560
- Oh, did you get my
sardines and whipped cream?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.567
- Oh, you were serious?

20:12.690 --> 20:13.770
- Don't judge me.

20:13.770 --> 20:15.783
- Oh, oh my God.

20:17.070 --> 20:18.920
Baby, where did that voice come from?

20:20.760 --> 20:21.593
- The baby.

20:21.593 --> 20:22.426
- It was the baby?

20:22.426 --> 20:24.180
Don't you put that on
our baby. (Mary laughs)

20:24.180 --> 20:28.307
Don't you put that on
our baby, mm-mm. (laughs)

you given any thought

23:23.460 --> 23:26.700
to what you'd like to use
as collateral for this loan?

23:26.700 --> 23:28.350

23:29.400 --> 23:32.820
- Oh, okay, the condo with no equity.

I'm gonna guess that you
don't know what equity is

23:35.490 --> 23:37.623
because you don't have any.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.470
Does that sound right?

23:40.470 --> 23:43.230
We're not in the risk
business, Mrs. Taylor,

23:43.230 --> 23:45.150
so we're not gonna give you money

23:45.150 --> 23:47.733
that you can't pay back, okay?

23:49.260 --> 23:50.093
Okay?

23:50.970 --> 23:54.240
However, if maybe Mommy and
Daddy could cosign this loan,

23:54.240 --> 23:55.073
we could do it.

23:56.010 --> 23:59.220
- Um, no, my mom left us when I was two

23:59.220 --> 24:01.680
and never looked back.
- Wait, was it a pool boy?

24:01.680 --> 24:02.670

24:02.670 --> 24:04.200
Pool boy?
- No, no.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.080
She just, she just left.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.940
Look, I really need this loan

24:08.940 --> 24:10.560
so that I can start my music studio.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.065
- Oh my God, let me guess.

24:12.065 --> 24:15.270
You want to be the next "American Idol"?

24:15.270 --> 24:19.140
Yeah, yeah, I can see it.

24:19.140 --> 24:22.500
- Listen, my dad passed
away and it was our dream

24:22.500 --> 24:24.600
to start this music studio together.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.820
Then his douche bag friend, Mr. Dalmer,

24:26.820 --> 24:29.730
told my dad on his deathbed
that the mob was gonna kill him

24:29.730 --> 24:32.553
if he didn't pay his
$300,000 gambling debt.

24:33.810 --> 24:35.610
- Do you know what that sounds like?

24:36.570 --> 24:38.070
That sounds like your problem.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.610
- Okay, so when he died,
me and my sister went

24:41.610 --> 24:42.840
to try to collect the money

24:42.840 --> 24:44.340
and he said, "Go screw yourself,"

24:44.340 --> 24:46.920
and we said we'd sue,
he said, "Get in line,"

24:46.920 --> 24:48.300
and that was just, it was four years ago.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.140
I just, I don't know,

24:49.140 --> 24:51.090
I don't understand how
someone could do that.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.530
- I don't know, with a name like Dalmer,

24:52.530 --> 24:54.773
maybe you're just lucky he
didn't eat your face off.

24:58.770 --> 25:01.140
- So I assume we have a deal?

25:01.140 --> 25:05.130
- Yes, it's a no, what is wrong with you?

25:05.130 --> 25:07.110
We're done here, we're done.

25:07.110 --> 25:09.600
Have a nice day, or don't, I don't care.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.590
We're done here, have a
nice day, okay, okay, God.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.910
What is wrong with this lady?

25:14.910 --> 25:16.650
How come I have to start my mornings

25:16.650 --> 25:19.800

25:19.800 --> 25:20.777
I need a latte.

25:20.777 --> 25:23.610

25:42.868 --> 25:46.200

25:46.200 --> 25:47.650
I'm gonna save you some time.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.810
I'm just under a lot of stress right now.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.253
- Well, that's not good.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.253
I'm afraid to say

25:55.253 --> 25:58.290
that this is something a
little more definitive.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.240
I'd like you to meet-

25:59.240 --> 26:00.909
- Hey, Doc, I'm sorry, I
really hate to be rude,

26:00.909 --> 26:02.033
but I've got a boss that's looking

26:02.033 --> 26:03.720
for any excuse to fire me,

26:03.720 --> 26:04.950
so if we could just wrap this up.

26:04.950 --> 26:07.590
- We received, we
received your test results

26:07.590 --> 26:12.033
from last week, and I'm
sorry to tell you, Amy,

26:13.920 --> 26:18.920
you have a brain tumor, and
unfortunately, it's inoperable.

26:19.140 --> 26:22.290
This is Dr. Krause, she's an oncologist

26:22.290 --> 26:24.690
and one of the leading in our field,

26:24.690 --> 26:27.783
and she can explain things
a little further for you.

26:28.890 --> 26:32.133
- Amy, you have a glioblastoma.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.813
- A what?

26:34.813 --> 26:37.478
- You have a glioblastoma.

26:37.478 --> 26:40.380
It's a brain tumor, and not only that,

26:40.380 --> 26:43.323
it's one of the fastest
growing brain tumors.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.273
- Okay, uh,

26:46.680 --> 26:47.940
okay, what's the treatment plan?

26:47.940 --> 26:49.320
Like, what do I, what?

26:49.320 --> 26:51.510
- There's no easy way to say this, Amy,

26:51.510 --> 26:53.880
but there is no treatment.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.010
- There's no chemo that
it would respond to

26:56.010 --> 26:58.443
and it's gone too far for radiation.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.620
- Unfortunately, you only have,

27:01.620 --> 27:04.628
you only have days to
live, maybe a week at most.

African safari or something.

51:35.208 --> 51:38.548

51:38.548 --> 51:39.381
- [Mary] Okay.

51:39.381 --> 51:40.650
- Okay, yeah, it was very serious stuff,

51:40.650 --> 51:45.330
and (laughs) the director
running the audition was

51:45.330 --> 51:49.440
this pretentious little prick
that actually screamed at me.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.273
- Stop!

51:50.273 --> 51:52.620
- And was like, "You're wasting my time."

51:52.620 --> 51:54.690
And told me I should never sing again.

51:54.690 --> 51:55.860
- What a dick.

51:55.860 --> 51:58.590
- Yeah, it was, so
obviously I run out of there

51:58.590 --> 52:00.900
and I'm bawling my eyes out.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.280
I run straight into Dad's arms

52:02.280 --> 52:05.283
and he just holds me for
what feels like an eternity.

52:06.188 --> 52:07.710

52:07.710 --> 52:09.903

52:10.740 --> 52:13.383
Uh, anyway, he, uh,

52:14.370 --> 52:15.659
he pulls me aside and he's like,

52:15.659 --> 52:20.257
"Amy, opinions are like
assholes, everyone's got one."

52:20.257 --> 52:21.156

52:21.156 --> 52:23.820
- Yeah, (laughs) yeah, it was hysterical.

52:23.820 --> 52:25.260

even though I'm sure

52:25.260 --> 52:28.650
I had no idea what he was
talking about. (laughs)

52:28.650 --> 52:31.230
Okay, the next part is
what makes Dad a legend.

52:31.230 --> 52:32.880
So he, um, he's like,
"Okay, you stay here.

52:32.880 --> 52:35.880
I'm gonna go get parking
validation or something,

52:35.880 --> 52:37.470
okay, like, wait in the car."

52:37.470 --> 52:41.790
But obviously I followed
him and I see him onstage,

52:41.790 --> 52:43.430
walks up to the director-

52:43.430 --> 52:45.050
- [Mary] Amy, you're
killing me with this pace.

52:45.050 --> 52:46.500
- I'm sorry, (laughs) sorry, he's, like,

52:46.500 --> 52:47.970
walks up to the director
and he just starts

52:47.970 --> 52:50.400
to lay it into this guy, right?

52:50.400 --> 52:52.440
He's just, like, really giving it to him.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.810
The guy just finally, once Dad's finished,

52:54.810 --> 52:57.450
he's like, "I'm not
the director." (laughs)

52:57.450 --> 52:59.910
And he points to the guy
that is the director,

52:59.910 --> 53:01.620
who, for some reason, has a clarinet,

53:01.620 --> 53:04.590
and he walks over and
he gets within inches

53:04.590 --> 53:06.937
of the real director's
face, and he's like,

53:06.937 --> 53:11.070
"If you ever bully a child ever again,

53:11.070 --> 53:12.960
I will personally come down here

53:12.960 --> 53:16.080
and shove that clarinet
so far up your ass,

53:16.080 --> 53:17.395
you'll be shitting show tunes

53:19.780 --> 53:21.220

53:21.220 --> 53:22.767
- [Amy] I know. (laughs)

53:22.767 --> 53:24.264
- [Mary] Holy shit, how have
I never heard that story?

53:24.264 --> 53:25.913
- I don't know, but yeah,

53:25.913 --> 53:28.860
so then the director calls me the next day

53:28.860 --> 53:29.973
and he apologized,

53:30.870 --> 53:32.903
and I never told Dad
I saw the whole thing.

53:34.050 --> 53:37.830
- Wow, he really was awesome.

53:37.830 --> 53:38.663
- Yeah.

53:41.100 --> 53:43.250
What about you, what's
your best Dad story?

53:49.920 --> 53:50.753

53:57.046 --> 53:57.879
- Ugh.

- Dumped me on the day of the prom?

53:59.520 --> 54:01.110
- Yeah, such a bitch.

54:01.110 --> 54:04.860
- I was so upset, I literally
could not stop crying.

54:04.860 --> 54:05.693
- Oh.

54:05.693 --> 54:09.003
- Yeah, so I walked to his
house, ready to have a showdown.

54:09.900 --> 54:10.733
- [Amy] Yeah?

54:10.733 --> 54:12.150
- I charged down his street.

54:12.150 --> 54:14.167
I saw all of his family and friends,

54:14.167 --> 54:17.190
all of his football broskis all outside

54:17.190 --> 54:20.130
on the front lawn, posing
for their pictures.

54:20.130 --> 54:21.431
Their backs were to me, though,

54:21.431 --> 54:23.850
so they couldn't see
me, and I was feet away

54:23.850 --> 54:26.580
and about to begin this
blood curdling rant

54:26.580 --> 54:28.590
about his tiny little micro penis-

54:28.590 --> 54:30.282
- [Amy] Oh my God. (laughs)

54:30.282 --> 54:34.620
- And then a man in a
lucha libre wrestling mask-

54:34.620 --> 54:35.453
- [Amy] No.

54:35.453 --> 54:38.970
- Rocking a Walkman, singing
"America the Beautiful"

54:38.970 --> 54:43.200
at the top of his lungs, was streaking by,

54:43.200 --> 54:47.610
waving a giant sign that
said, "Don's a pussy,"

54:47.610 --> 54:51.930
absolutely naked, between the
crowd and the photographer.

54:51.930 --> 54:52.763
- Oh my God.

54:54.560 --> 54:58.353
Oh my God, I wondered why he
bought that lucha libre mask.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.680
My God. (laughs)
- Yeah.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.363
- What the fuck? (laughs)

55:05.310 --> 55:08.010
Yeah, there's literally
nothing he wouldn't do for us.

1:08:13.337 --> 1:08:14.823
- I love you, be careful!

1:08:18.013 --> 1:08:19.124

1:08:19.124 --> 1:08:22.291
(Mr. Dalmer sputters)

1:08:24.643 --> 1:08:26.990
- What the, what, what the fuck?

1:08:26.990 --> 1:08:31.500
- You know, a woman scorned,
hell hath no fury, all that?

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:34.380
Except add to that that the
woman only has a day to live,

1:08:34.380 --> 1:08:37.140
and you stole my dad's last
dime, and you're a dick.

1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:39.750
- [Mr. Dalmer] What the
fuck are you talking about?

1:08:39.750 --> 1:08:43.230
- You have two options, the
first one will end well,

1:08:43.230 --> 1:08:44.853
and the second one won't.

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:49.590
You just simply have to wire me $350,000.

1:08:49.590 --> 1:08:52.710
- Three, (scoffs) no,
no, no, it was 300,000.

1:08:52.710 --> 1:08:55.113
- Yeah, the extra 50K is an asshole tax.

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.759
- Yeah, and what's my second option?

1:08:58.759 --> 1:08:59.592
(slow ominous music)

1:08:59.592 --> 1:09:01.570
- You don't want to
know your second option.

1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:16.564
- You're bluffing, you
don't have the balls.

1:09:16.564 --> 1:09:19.819
- No, (laughs) actually,
you don't have the balls.

1:09:19.819 --> 1:09:23.880
(Mr. Dalmer screams)
(Amy laughs)

1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.364
- [Mr. Dalmer] You are
going to prison, bitch.

1:09:25.364 --> 1:09:26.497
- [Amy] Oh, yeah?

1:09:26.497 --> 1:09:27.870
(Mr. Dalmer screams)

1:09:27.870 --> 1:09:31.638
- Okay, fine, fine, fine,
I'll wire the money.

1:09:31.638 --> 1:09:35.555
(slow ominous music continues)

1:09:37.230 --> 1:09:38.063
Fine.

1:09:43.590 --> 1:09:44.423
Happy?

1:09:44.423 --> 1:09:46.683
- Yeah, it was a good choice.

1:09:48.780 --> 1:09:52.641
- Wait a minute, you, you're
live streaming this? (laughs)

1:09:52.641 --> 1:09:56.250
You stupid bitch, you two
broads are gonna die in prison.

1:09:56.250 --> 1:09:58.593
This is kidnapping, it's kidnapping!

1:10:00.523 --> 1:10:02.990
- You tell anyone else
that Mary was involved,

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:04.115
I will personally make sure

1:10:04.115 --> 1:10:06.873
that it's not just your
balls that fry, okay?

1:10:07.830 --> 1:10:10.380
Oh, and one more thing, by the way,

1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:12.150
where are the keys to your Lambo?

1:10:12.150 --> 1:10:14.200
- [Mr. Dalmer] Eat a bag of dicks, bitch.

1:10:15.228 --> 1:10:16.410
(Mr. Dalmer screams)

1:10:16.410 --> 1:10:17.700
Oh, top drawer!

1:10:17.700 --> 1:10:18.566
- Thank you.
