00:01.167 --> 00:03.036
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:03.103 --> 00:04.270
{\an1}You see
that little screw there?

00:04.337 --> 00:06.206
{\an1}Just go ahead
and tighten her up.

00:06.272 --> 00:07.540
{\an5}BILLY: Like this?

00:06.272 --> 00:07.540
GEORGE SR.: Yep.

00:07.607 --> 00:08.208
Uh, run outside

00:08.274 --> 00:09.409
and turn the water back on.

00:09.476 --> 00:10.777
Who knew you were so handy?

00:10.844 --> 00:13.446
Yeah. There's just things
guys need to be good at.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.482
What else you good at?

00:18.118 --> 00:19.686
{\an3}Pastor Jeff is
looking to bring in

00:19.753 --> 00:21.755
{\an5}<i>a youth pastor.</i>

00:19.753 --> 00:21.755
Well, hey, y'all.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.023
I need to tell you something
in confidence.

00:24.090 --> 00:27.427
No one's home.
It's just the two of us.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.596
That's what I was hoping.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.365
This is wrong.

00:32.432 --> 00:33.600
(gasps)

00:38.204 --> 00:39.606
Hey.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.574
{\an5}Oh, hi.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.574
{\an3}Question.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.310
Y'all ever had a youth lock-in?

00:44.377 --> 00:47.147
Oh. No.
Whenever we talk about it,

00:47.213 --> 00:49.416
{\an5}Pastor Jeff shoots it down.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.416
{\an3}Why?

00:49.482 --> 00:50.817
Kids love sleepovers.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.752
Doing it here
shows them church can be fun.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.255
I don't know.
The Methodists did it last year.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.424
They're still cleaning up
Silly String.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.359
Sounds like they had a blast.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.361
I'll talk to Pastor Jeff.

01:01.428 --> 01:04.631
(chuckles): Okay,
but don't say I didn't warn you.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.466
Lock-in? I love it!

01:06.533 --> 01:07.600
Look at that.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.135
You always say no.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.670
That was before I had a baby
in the house.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.207
I love him, but a night away
sounds like magic.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.576
{\an1}I'm on it. Hey, you want
to chaperone with me?

01:16.643 --> 01:18.845
{\an3}Oh. Uh...

01:18.912 --> 01:20.713
{\an5}I don't know.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.713
{\an1}ROB:
Come on.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.316
{\an1}We'll pull an all-nighter.
It'll be fun.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.651
{\an3}JEFF:
Yeah, Mary.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.119
Don't be such a lame-o.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.555
{\an4}(chuckles)

01:26.186 --> 01:28.555
I'm not a lame-o.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.857
I'm a fun-o.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.492
So you're in?

01:33.493 --> 01:34.794
{\an3}You betcha.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.129
All right. Fun-o is in.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.364
{\an1}We got ourselves
a lock-in to plan.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.435
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:42.502 --> 01:45.338
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:45.405 --> 01:47.874
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:47.941 --> 01:50.310
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:50.376 --> 01:53.546
♪<i> I am a mighty little man.</i> ♪

02:01.855 --> 02:04.390
{\an9}(exhales)
Come on.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.627
{\an8}(sighs)

02:08.695 --> 02:10.597
{\an8}Need a hand?

02:10.663 --> 02:13.132
{\an9}This thing ate my quarters,
and now it's stuck.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.235
{\an7}That tends to happen
with number seven.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.470
{\an7}What you want to do
is a push-pull.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.641
{\an8}And here I was just pushing
like a damn fool.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.810
{\an9}(chuckles)

02:21.708 --> 02:23.810
{\an8}I ain't seen you in here before.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.279
{\an8}Oh, I just moved back
from San Antonio.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.248
{\an8}Oh, big city girl.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.885
{\an8}Well, now I'm "living
back with my parents" girl.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.319
{\an8}That's all right.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.823
{\an8}I lived with my folks
not too long ago.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.459
{\an8}Isn't it weird?
Whenever you live at home,

02:39.526 --> 02:41.461
{\an8}no matter how old you are,
you feel like a teenager.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.297
{\an8}It did feel that way.
I'm Georgie.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.231
{\an8}Mandy.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.166
{\an8}And now that we're
on a first-name basis,

02:47.233 --> 02:48.835
{\an8}I'm gonna throw my underwear
in here.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.504
{\an7}And since I'm a gentleman,
I ain't gonna look.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.577
{\an8}You just looked.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.279
{\an7}I did.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.282
{\an8}You do not look as if you meet
the age requirement.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.317
{\an8}I'll be 16 next month.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.319
{\an9}Wil Wheaton plays
Wesley Crusher.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.954
{\an9}He's a child prodigy
who's very young

03:08.021 --> 03:10.323
{\an9}to be on the bridge of
a Galaxy-class starship.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.292
{\an8}Okay.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.292
{\an8}But he's so intelligent

03:12.358 --> 03:14.460
{\an8}that most people
come to rely on him.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.328
{\an8}Okay.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.864
{\an8}Sounds kind of familiar, huh?

03:15.395 --> 03:17.864
{\an8}Okay.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.265
{\an8}(door opens)
MARY:
Anybody home?

03:19.332 --> 03:21.334
{\an8}(door closes)
In here.
Hello.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.669
{\an9}Okay.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.672
{\an9}I have something fun for us
to do on Saturday night.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.507
{\an7}Ooh, what?

03:25.738 --> 03:27.507
{\an8}The church is thinking...

03:27.574 --> 03:28.608
{\an8}No.
Ugh.

03:28.675 --> 03:29.909
{\an8}Hold on.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.779
{\an8}We're gonna do
an overnight lock-in

03:32.845 --> 03:34.981
{\an8}with pizza and games and movies.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.449
{\an8}Boys and girls?

03:36.516 --> 03:37.116
{\an8}Yes.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.319
{\an8}I got to find cute pajamas.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.590
{\an8}So, what do you say?

03:43.656 --> 03:44.958
{\an8}Disrupting my sleep schedule

03:45.024 --> 03:46.593
{\an8}to fraternize
with children my own age?

03:46.659 --> 03:48.595
{\an8}We both know the answer.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.595
{\an9}MARY:
I figured.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.563
{\an8}I just wanted to make sure.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.967
{\an9}Although I could use
someone as my eyes and ears

03:54.033 --> 03:55.902
{\an9}if the kids get
to causing trouble.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.371
{\an8}Are you asking me
to help enforce the rules

03:58.438 --> 03:59.872
{\an8}and police the other children?

03:59.939 --> 04:01.808
{\an8}Well, I wouldn't put it
quite like that.

04:01.874 --> 04:02.942
{\an8}Because if you do, I'm in.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.611
{\an8}Then what you said.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.312
{\an8}I need to pick out pajamas.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.623
{\an8}Did you give it
the old push-pull?

04:16.689 --> 04:17.790
{\an8}You're back soon.

04:17.857 --> 04:18.725
{\an8}What do you know

04:18.791 --> 04:20.493
{\an8}about getting wine stains
out of rayon?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.395
{\an8}You got to let it soak first.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.630
{\an8}Does that work?

04:23.696 --> 04:25.264
{\an8}I don't know.
That's just my answer

04:25.331 --> 04:26.733
{\an8}to every laundry question.

04:26.799 --> 04:27.967
{\an8}(laughs)
Smooth.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.836
{\an8}So, what'd you do
in San Antonio?

04:29.902 --> 04:33.339
{\an8}I was the weather girl
at the local TV station.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.440
{\an7}No way.

04:34.507 --> 04:35.842
{\an8}So you were on TV?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.043
{\an8}5:30 every morning.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.445
{\an8}More people are seeing me
right here.

04:39.512 --> 04:40.313
Why'd you leave?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.582
The station manager and I
broke up.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.350
But now his new girlfriend

04:44.417 --> 04:45.418
gets to be on TV.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.754
At 8:30. That bitch.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.422
{\an5}That sucks.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.422
{\an3}And now

04:49.489 --> 04:51.524
I'm here,
hoping I don't run into anybody

04:51.591 --> 04:52.759
I went to high school with.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.494
Well, I think you're safe.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.630
Loretta there is one
of our younger customers.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.867
Oh. Seems like a good place
to meet girls.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.702
I met you.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.770
But play it cool.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.505
Loretta can get real jealous.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.306
{\an3}(whispers):
Okay.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.044
{\an1}Last chance.
You can still come chaperone.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.046
Hmm. All night in a church

05:13.112 --> 05:14.947
with a bunch
of other people's kids.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.517
And Pastor Jeff and Pastor Rob.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.685
Ooh, two pastors?

05:18.751 --> 05:20.053
Well, that is hard to say no to,

05:20.119 --> 05:22.055
but let me give it a shot. No.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.458
Your loss.
Missy, tell Billy we're leaving

05:25.525 --> 05:27.560
{\an5}in 20 minutes!

05:25.525 --> 05:27.560
MISSY:
Okay!

05:27.627 --> 05:29.595
Billy's going, too, huh?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.998
{\an5}Yeah, of course.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.998
And Brenda gonna chaperone?

05:32.065 --> 05:33.933
{\an5}She was less interested
than you.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.933
{\an3}(chuckles)

05:34.000 --> 05:36.669
Oh, there's no way
she's less interested than me.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.771
(sighs)

05:43.009 --> 05:44.811
(indistinct chatter)

05:47.613 --> 05:49.082
{\an3}JEFF:
Well,

05:49.148 --> 05:51.017
I've already confiscated
a can of shaving cream,

05:51.084 --> 05:53.953
{\an3}a box of stink bombs
and a PG-13 movie.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.055
{\an5}What was the movie?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.055
<i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

05:56.122 --> 05:58.357
Which is redundant
because all dancing's dirty.

05:58.424 --> 06:02.095
{\an1}Well, I guess it's good
we got some eyes on the inside.

06:03.162 --> 06:06.532
Okay, I think everyone's here.
Why don't we, uh,

06:06.599 --> 06:08.968
circle up,
kick things off with a prayer.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.270
Great.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.373
{\an1}Great. Take
your neighbor's hand.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.844
Uh, Pastor Jeff,

06:17.910 --> 06:19.912
{\an5}why don't you get in
on this. (chuckles)

06:17.910 --> 06:19.912
JEFF: Okay. (chuckles)

06:21.147 --> 06:22.915
I'm neither holding hands
nor praying.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.717
I don't even know
why I walked over here.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.053
Heavenly Father, may this
evening bring us closer to you.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.388
{\an1}Keep us safe
and, most importantly,

06:29.455 --> 06:32.091
{\an1}Heavenly Father, help us
rock this night of fellowship.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.527
In Jesus' name
we pray, amen.

06:34.594 --> 06:35.795
ALL:
Amen.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.430
I don't think he heard you.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.898
Amen!

06:38.965 --> 06:40.833
He can't hear you
because he's not real.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.769
{\an1}One more time
for Sheldon, y'all.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.637
Amen!

06:50.943 --> 06:52.612
(TV playing indistinctly)

07:00.653 --> 07:02.155
(grunts)

07:06.659 --> 07:08.861
(sighs)

07:12.799 --> 07:14.467
(phone rings)

07:14.534 --> 07:16.169
Hello.

07:17.837 --> 07:20.006
Hello?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.476
<i>(door creaking over TV)</i>

07:29.182 --> 07:30.550
I've seen this before.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.686
{\an1}They're big now,
but they're gonna get small.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.989
{\an3}Yeah. It's called <i> Honey,</i>
<i>I Shrunk the Kids.</i>

07:37.056 --> 07:39.659
{\an1}(whispers):
If you get scared, I'm here.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.527
{\an3}Terrific.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.663
{\an3}Bad news.

07:43.729 --> 07:44.764
Baby's got a fever.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.199
{\an5}I need to go home.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.199
Oh, no.

07:46.265 --> 07:48.534
{\an3}Well, don't worry about things
here. We got it covered.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.203
{\an6}Thank you.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.203
{\an1}PEG:
If you want

07:50.269 --> 07:51.637
extra help, I can come.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.739
N-No, no, we need you here.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.174
{\an3}I think you and I
could handle it alone.

07:55.241 --> 07:58.578
N... This is definitely
a three-person job.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.112
{\an3}(chuckles):
Okay, if you say so.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.048
{\an3}JEFF:
All right, good luck.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.150
I'm here in spirit.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.653
{\an1}If Sheldon
finds booze, dibs.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.721
{\an1}GEORGE JR.:
<i>You know one of the best things</i>

08:08.788 --> 08:11.691
{\an1}about working here? I always
smell like dryer sheets.

08:11.757 --> 08:12.925
Is that a good thing?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.594
Compared to how I used to smell,

08:14.660 --> 08:15.795
{\an4}yeah.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.795
(dryer buzzes)

08:15.862 --> 08:16.896
Oh. I guess I'm done.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.865
Actually, sometimes

08:18.931 --> 08:21.901
{\an1}these machines don't get it
all dry on the first go.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.203
Let me buy you
another round.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.239
{\an5}Okay. Thanks.

{\an3}How about, while this runs,
I take you to dinner?

08:33.111 --> 08:34.746
How old are you?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.816
GEORGE JR.:
<i>Do not say 17.</i>

08:36.883 --> 08:38.116
Old enough.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.919
Old enough to what? To drink?

08:40.986 --> 08:42.688
{\an3}Yes, ma'am.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.658
(chuckles): "Ma'am"?
How old do you think I am?

08:45.725 --> 08:48.761
{\an3}Well, I'm also old enough
to know that's a trap,

08:48.828 --> 08:49.228
{\an3}so...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.296
How old are you?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.798
{\an5}25.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.798
21.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.600
I was worried
you were gonna say "19."

08:54.667 --> 08:57.103
{\an3}Oh, no, I promise
I'm not 19.

{\an5}Hey.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.315
Oh. Hi, Connie.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.716
Is your power out?

09:10.783 --> 09:12.318
No. Yours?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.754
Well, I just like asking
everybody that question.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.022
Of course it's out.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.189
Don't yell at me.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.324
I'm not yelling at you.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.559
{\an5}It's just
such a stupid question.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.129

of the street.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.064

09:25.131 --> 09:26.299

in the dark

09:27.967 --> 09:29.201

09:29.268 --> 09:31.237
I got candles.
I'm gonna get some takeout.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.672

11:03.796 --> 11:05.398
and everyone else
tries to find them.

{\an3}That sounds like an
acceptable form of fun.

It's only fun when we have
a really good hider,

if it was gonna rain or not?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.291
Oh, I didn't.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.061
I just wore something low-cut

12:09.228 --> 12:10.429
Yeah, but I'm driving,

12:10.496 --> 12:12.731
so I'll probably
just have a sip or two.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.901
Or none.
I'm pretty full on chips.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.115
{\an3}(chuckles)

16:56.915 --> 16:59.485
I guess it reminds
me of being young.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.320
Hmm.
(chuckles)

17:01.387 --> 17:03.489
{\an1}You remember
your first cigarette?

17:03.555 --> 17:04.757
Eighth grade.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.625
{\an3}I snuck it out of
my mom's purse.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.727
{\an4}(chuckles)

17:06.692 --> 17:08.727
Ugh, menthol.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.596
{\an4}Ooh.
(chuckles)

17:08.794 --> 17:10.596
{\an3}(chuckles)

17:10.662 --> 17:12.196
{\an3}You?

17:12.263 --> 17:13.732
Freshman year of college,

17:13.799 --> 17:18.137
{\an4}trying to impress
Melissa Coolidge at a party.

17:13.799 --> 17:18.137
Mm. (chuckles)

17:18.203 --> 17:21.507
{\an5}Man, I threw up so much.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.507
{\an3}(chuckles):
Oh, no.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.075
In my defense,

17:23.142 --> 17:25.377
{\an1}it was
an impressive amount.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.646
(both laugh)

17:27.713 --> 17:30.182
Anyway, his name is Billy,

17:30.249 --> 17:33.085
{\an1}and he's in sixth grade,
so you're gonna be seeing him

17:33.152 --> 17:36.588
{\an4}in three or four
or five years.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.588
{\an3}(chuckles)

17:36.655 --> 17:39.591
{\an1}You met him at my house
when we were playing poker.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.394
{\an5}The big kid. I love that kid.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.394
{\an1}GEORGE SR.:
Mm-hmm.

17:42.461 --> 17:46.098
{\an1}Good. Remember that
when he's failing homeroom.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.200
Oh, don't worry about grades.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.302
He's gonna be a linebacker.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.071
{\an3}Where you been hiding
this one, George?

17:53.138 --> 17:54.540
Haven't been hiding her.

17:54.606 --> 17:57.776
Well, not that easy to hide.
(chuckles)

17:57.843 --> 17:59.478
I'll get us another round.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.080
Tell her how I make more money
than you.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.849
(chuckles)

18:05.851 --> 18:07.820
Think I'm gonna head out.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.455
Please don't.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.523
I need to.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.425
You stay. I'll go.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.494
No. You're having fun.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.464
Are you mad at me?

18:19.465 --> 18:20.866
No.
