the kick on this.

01:37.581 --> 01:39.264
I'd rather just feel it.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.174
- Grandma and me made
these popsicles

01:41.251 --> 01:43.009
from the blueberries we picked.
Take one.

01:43.162 --> 01:44.177
- Jo Jo, what did I tell you

01:44.330 --> 01:46.163
about coming in here without
permission?

01:46.165 --> 01:47.497
- It's my daddy's studio.

01:47.499 --> 01:48.498
- No, it isn't.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.776
- It's Grandpa's house, Jo.
You know that.

01:50.853 --> 01:54.321
Go play in your room a minute
while we wrap up here, okay?

01:59.528 --> 02:00.844
- This board belonged
to Creedence,

02:00.846 --> 02:02.121
I'd rather not ruin it.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.531
- Leo was telling me that
he thinks you should record

02:04.683 --> 02:07.184
an acoustic version
of Mojave Moon.

02:07.186 --> 02:08.869
- Well, this is
a Greatest Hits Album.

02:08.945 --> 02:12.189
That was definitely not a hit.
- Because you never released it.

02:12.207 --> 02:14.708
- 'Cause it's not a hit.
- It will be.

02:15.361 --> 02:17.094
- We'll talk about it.

02:19.047 --> 02:21.381
- Jo Jo just ran past me crying.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.142
She said you yelled at her?
- I didn't yell.

02:23.218 --> 02:25.293
- She's still figuring out
the new living arrangement.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.221
- Yelling at her won't help.
- I'll talk to her.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.224
Let's, uh... pick this
up tomorrow, huh?

02:31.301 --> 02:32.985
- Yeah, we're good.
- Thanks, Bergs.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.228
- You're welcome to stay
for dinner Bergs.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.156
- Love to, but Chris Martin's
in town

02:37.383 --> 02:39.216
with some new artist
he wants me to meet.

02:39.234 --> 02:41.743
Someone he found on TikTok
or some other nonsense.

02:42.479 --> 02:43.570
- We'll walk you out.

02:43.889 --> 02:46.448
- I have to clean up some stuff
here, so you go ahead.

02:47.651 --> 02:50.669
- It's good to see you, Leo.
- You too, Bergs.

02:58.995 --> 03:00.679

(Anne): I love that sound.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.635
- I don't hear anything.

03:48.787 --> 03:50.378
- Exactly.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
(chuckling)

03:55.461 --> 03:57.552
(Billy sighs)

03:57.604 --> 04:00.797
- Who would ever have imagined
we'd have a grown child

04:00.799 --> 04:02.482
in the house at this age?

04:03.059 --> 04:05.494
- We're lucky.
We can help.

04:07.656 --> 04:08.805
- Are we?

04:09.308 --> 04:10.991
- He'll leave when he's ready.

04:11.568 --> 04:13.234
- You said that about
his diapers.

04:13.312 --> 04:14.920
- He doesn't wear them
anymore, does he?

04:14.997 --> 04:17.506
(chuckling)

04:22.154 --> 04:24.154
- I gotta go run a quick errand.

04:24.156 --> 04:26.156
- Where?
- I got a thing.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.749
I'm... I'm meeting someone.

04:27.826 --> 04:28.750
- Leo.

04:28.827 --> 04:30.084
(sighs)

04:30.162 --> 04:31.270
- I promised Dana I'd help her

04:31.421 --> 04:32.679
hang curtain rods
in the apartment.

04:32.831 --> 04:35.165
- Doesn't she have a super
or a handyman to do that?

04:35.183 --> 04:37.276
Why do you--
- I want to see her.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.260
She's still Jo Jo's mother,
whether you like it or not.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.428
- Not.

04:40.689 --> 04:43.340
Come on, Leo, wise up.
She triggers you every time.

04:43.358 --> 04:45.117
- She doesn't "trigger" me,

04:45.268 --> 04:46.676
and please don't use
therapy talk

04:46.678 --> 04:49.679
when you don't understand it.
- Sorry. We're just...

04:49.681 --> 04:50.998
concerned.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.849
- I know.

04:53.035 --> 04:56.277
And I appreciate you letting
Jo Jo and me live here for now.

04:56.355 --> 04:58.780
But you have to trust me, okay?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.540
- Okay.

05:00.617 --> 05:02.092
- Alright.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.560
(soft guitar playing)

05:31.332 --> 05:33.557
- I just saw the appointment
reminder from Nan.

05:33.559 --> 05:35.817
You didn't tell me you're
getting another scan next month.

05:35.894 --> 05:37.985
- You have enough on your plate.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.396
- I'm a doctor.

05:39.414 --> 05:42.399
- You're a psychiatrist,
not an oncologist.

05:42.417 --> 05:45.085
- You're not due for
a scan until next year.

05:45.237 --> 05:46.903
Why did Nan order it?

05:47.664 --> 05:52.267
- She didn't love the numbers
on my blood work, so.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.583
No point worrying about it now.

05:59.601 --> 06:03.695
Let's just wait and see where
we are after the scan, huh?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.491
Hey, it's okay.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.537
(alarm blaring)

06:14.357 --> 06:16.750
Guest house.
Call 9-1-1!

06:22.549 --> 06:25.083
- Daddy! Please, wake up!

06:25.085 --> 06:28.628
Daddy! Please, please.

06:28.780 --> 06:29.679
Wake up.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.448
Please, wake up!

06:31.450 --> 06:33.058
- Jo Jo! You need to go outside,
right now.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.618
- Daddy, wake up.
Wake up!

06:34.620 --> 06:37.979
- Listen to Grandpa. Go outside.
We'll be right there.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.693
(Billy coughing)

06:46.465 --> 06:49.491
(tense music)

06:54.990 --> 06:56.573
- Please, God.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.251
- Jo Jo, you have to go outside.

06:59.327 --> 07:02.963
- She can't be in here, Billy.
- Come on, let's go outside.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.550
- He's okay!

07:07.653 --> 07:09.136
Daddy!

07:09.930 --> 07:11.263
- Hiya, bug.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.723
Hi, hi, hi.

07:15.752 --> 07:18.311
- We've accepted the defendant's
guilty plea, Your Honour.

07:18.421 --> 07:21.088
The prosecution feels strongly
that he should not be given

07:21.108 --> 07:23.591
special treatment
because he's a celebrity.

07:23.669 --> 07:26.002
So we've requested the maximum
sentence available

07:26.004 --> 07:28.405
under the law for manslaughter.

07:45.707 --> 07:48.467
(bird chirping)

07:51.697 --> 07:53.046
- Grandma, look at this one!

07:53.198 --> 07:55.623
- Oh, that's a real beauty.
(phone chimes)

07:55.701 --> 07:57.959
- Daddy loves zucchini bread,
can we make some for him today?

07:58.036 --> 07:59.794
- It's Aunt Ramona's recipe.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.814
- When Grandma goes to pick up
your dad, we'll make it.

08:02.891 --> 08:04.524
- Yay!

08:05.986 --> 08:07.986
- I'll be right back.

08:13.142 --> 08:14.884
- Do we really have
to pick him up today?

08:14.978 --> 08:17.237
- He can't stay in rehab
forever.

08:17.313 --> 08:19.572
- Seeing you and Jo
Jo in the garden...

08:19.725 --> 08:20.999
(sighs)

08:21.150 --> 08:23.150
Things have been so calm
without Leo here.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.078
And honestly, how do we know
we can keep him safe?

08:25.230 --> 08:27.655
- That's why you're going
to speak to Dana.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.066
- There's only one language
that woman understands.

08:30.068 --> 08:33.094
- Whatever it takes
to keep her away.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.597
(sighs)

08:38.835 --> 08:42.354
(rumbling)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.777
(knocking)
- What?

08:57.854 --> 08:59.037
- Dana.
- What?

08:59.114 --> 09:01.164
- It's me, Billy.
I wanna talk to you.

09:02.117 --> 09:04.042
- What? Like last time? Go away.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.952
- Please, open the door.

09:06.104 --> 09:07.462
I wanna give you something.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.383
Look, Leo's getting out
of rehab today

09:11.534 --> 09:14.127
and we all think it'd be better
for both of you

09:14.279 --> 09:15.887
if you keep some distance.

09:15.964 --> 09:17.872
- You all think?
(chuckles)

09:17.949 --> 09:21.284
Well, then who am I to challenge
the legendary Billy Carlson

09:21.303 --> 09:23.286
and his band of screwed up
family members?

09:23.305 --> 09:25.955
- Dana, if you want help,
we'll help ya.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.473
We'd like nothin' more.

09:27.550 --> 09:29.809
But as long as you're using,
you gotta stay away from Leo.

09:29.961 --> 09:33.479
He's trying to get clean.
- I love him, you know.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.983
I always have.
- Well, if that's true then,

09:37.135 --> 09:38.410
you'll stay away.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.229
- You're not gonna keep me
away from my kid.

09:42.307 --> 09:43.823
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:43.975 --> 09:45.333
Here, how 'bout this, huh?

09:48.237 --> 09:50.163
But you gotta find someplace
else to live

09:50.239 --> 09:52.382
and you gotta change
your phone number.

09:54.836 --> 09:56.386
- Screw you, Billy.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.514
- Okay. Uh, you uh... you ready?
- Yes.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.684
- Mom. He was asking me.
- I'm sorry.

10:11.761 --> 10:12.685
- Where's Dad?

10:13.280 --> 10:17.115
- He had a meeting at the label.
He really wanted to be here.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.175
- Now listen, rebuilding trust
takes time, okay?

10:19.194 --> 10:20.677
It's part of the process.

10:20.679 --> 10:22.846
You just go to your meetings,
establish a routine,

10:22.848 --> 10:25.272
and uh... this is daily dose
of Buprenorphine.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.500
- To block the cravings.
- Yeah.

10:29.112 --> 10:31.037
You got this. Okay?

10:31.114 --> 10:33.465
- Yeah. Thanks.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.375
- Your father really
wanted to be here.

10:35.451 --> 10:37.469
- You already said.
- I did?

10:37.620 --> 10:39.529
- Look, I don't wanna
be a burden

10:39.547 --> 10:41.865
if you and dad don't want me.
- You're not a burden.

10:41.867 --> 10:44.017
You're our son.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.728
You're not a burden.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.889
So how was the food there?

10:49.966 --> 10:51.650
- It was, uh...
it was food.

10:51.801 --> 10:53.968
- Not so good?

10:54.045 --> 10:55.445
- Hey, kid.

10:56.731 --> 10:58.114
- Hey, Ro.

10:59.642 --> 11:00.659
Hiya, Bug.

11:03.221 --> 11:04.746
It's good to see you.

11:06.149 --> 11:08.625
- Daddy needs big hugs
today, remember?

11:09.986 --> 11:11.419
- Hi.

11:12.414 --> 11:14.089
Thank you.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.010
What's happening at school?
Anything good?

11:19.587 --> 11:21.829
- Tell Daddy about
the potato batteries.

11:21.907 --> 11:23.239
- Potato batteries?

11:23.241 --> 11:28.169
- The acid in potatoes reacts
with zinc or copper

11:28.188 --> 11:31.080
and we made a light bulb work.

11:31.099 --> 11:32.357
- Oh, for real?
(chuckling)

11:32.434 --> 11:33.583
(whispering): Offer him
zucchini.

11:33.585 --> 11:35.418
- Okay.
- Zucchini.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.938
- Also, I helped Aunt Ro make
zucchini bread for later today.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.573
All the cousins are coming.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.091
- Today?

11:42.110 --> 11:44.244
- Everyone really wanted
to see you.

11:44.779 --> 11:47.038
- Even Tommy?

11:47.690 --> 11:48.856
- Even Tommy.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.601
- Guess what? We're staying
in the main house now

11:51.619 --> 11:54.270
so you get the same room as
you did when you were my age.

11:54.363 --> 11:57.623
- Just until the guest house
renovations are done.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.760
It was supposed to be last
week, but you know.

12:01.629 --> 12:03.204
- Come on, I'll show you!

12:03.223 --> 12:05.131
<i> - This is Dana's phone.</i>
<i> You can leave a message,</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.541
<i> but I won't listen to it.</i>
<i> (beep)</i>

12:07.561 --> 12:09.469
- Hey Dana, it's me.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.355
(sighs)
Give me a call?

12:13.049 --> 12:15.024
(knocking)

12:16.052 --> 12:17.610
- Leo.

12:19.981 --> 12:21.239
- Hey, Dad.

12:21.316 --> 12:22.615
- Hey.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.414
Sorry, I, uh... sorry I didn't
pick you up, I had--

12:29.491 --> 12:32.642
- No, Mom told me.
It's cool.

12:32.660 --> 12:35.402
Really.
(clears throat)

12:35.480 --> 12:37.738
You're really taking
it down to the studs.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.906
- Yeah.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.817
- I didn't realize
I'd done so much damage.

12:40.819 --> 12:43.970
- The kitchen needed an update,
so it was a good excuse.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.656
- How's the album coming?

12:46.674 --> 12:49.601
- We, uh, wrapped the last
song a couple weeks ago.

12:50.328 --> 12:51.828
- Oh.
I didn't realize.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.089
- Label wasn't gonna wait, Leo.
Even if I wanted 'em to.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.649
- Of course not.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.185
(clears throat)

12:59.337 --> 13:01.095
Hey Dad, remember that...

13:01.172 --> 13:03.022
that summer when I was ten

13:03.099 --> 13:05.358
and Tommy and Ramona went away
to that camp for smart kids?

13:05.510 --> 13:07.010
- I thought you all went
to that.

13:07.028 --> 13:09.770
- No, it was... it was just
me and you in the house

13:09.823 --> 13:10.863
for two months.

13:11.199 --> 13:13.958
You spent the summer tinkering
away at that piano,

13:14.110 --> 13:16.127
humming that one song.
- Which song?

13:16.204 --> 13:18.505
- It doesn't have a name
because you never finished it.

13:20.300 --> 13:26.287
(singing): Every day keeps
falling faster than the last.

13:26.789 --> 13:32.718
But I still can't run faster,
faster than my past.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.272
- My only kid who
can carry a tune.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.467
- I think we should put
that song out as a bonus track.

13:40.545 --> 13:43.137
I could go through
your old notebooks,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.073
piece a melody together.

13:45.808 --> 13:47.700
Give me something to do.

13:48.553 --> 13:49.719
- You know what?

13:49.830 --> 13:53.039
See what you can do with it.
We'll run it by Bergs.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.125
- Great.

13:59.564 --> 14:01.247
(Jake): Hey, Grandpa.
(Jo Jo): Hey, guys.

14:01.399 --> 14:02.674
(Jake): Uncle Leo!
Pass the ball.

14:03.918 --> 14:05.826
(Anne): Leo, come say hello.

14:05.846 --> 14:06.827
(Jake): For the pass.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.179
- Hey, Sis.
- Hey.

14:08.256 --> 14:10.239
- Hey, Ted.
- You look good, Leo.

14:10.258 --> 14:11.683
- One day at a time.

14:11.759 --> 14:14.927
- This fish is almost done,
so where's Tommy?

14:15.004 --> 14:16.312
- He was right behind us.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.174
- Hey.

14:20.251 --> 14:21.417
It's good to see you, Tommy.

14:21.419 --> 14:22.602
- Yeah, you too.

14:22.678 --> 14:25.029
- We don't need the booze
right now, Tommy.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.773
- Leo can handle seeing alcohol.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.851
He knows the drill.
Hell, even I know the drill.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.370
- Leo's been out one day.

14:32.597 --> 14:35.431
- Leo's right here.
And it's fine.

14:35.433 --> 14:38.359
Alcohol was never my problem.
- Okay. Fine.

14:38.436 --> 14:40.712
In that case,
I'll get champagne.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.882
- Your problem was
what again? Oxycontin?

14:43.958 --> 14:46.033
- Tommy, watch it.

14:46.127 --> 14:48.461
- Why, is it a secret?

14:48.537 --> 14:50.446
I honestly can't remember
what you were on

14:50.448 --> 14:52.615
when you and Dana left Jake
in the park that time.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.300
- Hey, let's not use
my son against Leo.

14:54.377 --> 14:56.728
- I'm just curious.
- What does it matter?

14:56.879 --> 14:59.063
- Yes, it was Oxy.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.307
And I've apologized.

15:01.459 --> 15:02.066
Many times.

15:02.143 --> 15:04.360
(bottle pops)

15:06.297 --> 15:09.390
- I'd like to welcome
our firstborn child back home

15:09.467 --> 15:11.134
and tell you how proud I am...

15:11.136 --> 15:13.119
how proud we all are.

15:20.495 --> 15:23.922
- Oh here, Mom, lemme get that.
- Thank you, honey.

15:23.998 --> 15:26.090
- Don't light anything on fire.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.833
- God, you're still such an ass.

15:28.577 --> 15:31.003
How's it going with you being
back in your old room?

15:31.156 --> 15:32.430
- Uh, weird.

15:32.581 --> 15:35.174
Mom put out all my trophies
and stuff.

15:35.326 --> 15:37.827
You try masturbating under
a Star Wars blanket.

15:37.829 --> 15:38.728
- Gross.

15:40.165 --> 15:41.773
- She email you the thing?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.683
- What're you talking about?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.777
- We got a numbered list
of off-limit conversation

15:45.928 --> 15:48.004
topics for tonight.
- You're joking.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.990
Come on.
What was number one?

15:51.767 --> 15:52.358
(both): Dana.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.342
- Seriously?

15:53.528 --> 15:54.619
- I think Mom was half
expecting her

15:54.955 --> 15:57.180
to crash the party today.
- The girl's a train wreck.

15:57.198 --> 15:59.457
- How can you be so cold?
She's Jo Jo's mom.

15:59.608 --> 16:02.685
- She was the worst thing
to happen to this family.

16:02.687 --> 16:04.203
She practically gave
Dad the cancer.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.423
- Screw you.
- Stop it, both of you.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.784
- I'm trying, Tommy.

16:10.862 --> 16:12.303
I am.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.713
Give me a chance.

16:14.199 --> 16:15.622
- Give you a chance?

16:15.700 --> 16:17.533
I was 13 the first time
I found you OD'ing

16:17.535 --> 16:18.959
on the floor
of the family room.

16:19.037 --> 16:20.219
- Tommy, that's enough.

16:20.296 --> 16:21.721
- Fifteen when you and Dana
vanished

16:21.797 --> 16:24.649
into thin air for four months.
- Okay, I'm sorry,

16:24.800 --> 16:27.986
what else am I supposed to do?
- Nineteen years of this crap.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.988
Nineteen years.
I am done!

16:30.064 --> 16:31.972
- Maybe you and everybody else'd
be happier

16:31.974 --> 16:34.575
than if I just dropped dead!
- You already tried that, bro.

16:43.411 --> 16:44.910
- Tommy is a jerk.
- He's angry.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.562
And not without reason.

16:46.581 --> 16:47.821
- I don't understand why you're
always defending him.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.173
- Cause he's my kid brother.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.418
- Yeah, well I'm your sister
and I'm telling you that...

16:52.570 --> 16:54.328
Hey, Dad, you okay?

16:54.405 --> 16:56.163
(out of breath): Yeah. Fine.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.391
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.437
- Come on.

17:05.007 --> 17:06.357
(long exhale)

17:06.434 --> 17:08.693
- His Gleason score is up.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.530
Which means the malignancy
is increasing.

17:12.607 --> 17:13.756
- Not necessarily.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.275
- Maybe it's time for surgery,
considering his pain.

17:16.427 --> 17:18.661
- Can I see his biopsy result?

17:20.932 --> 17:22.281
His PSA hasn't moved much.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.100
What about radiation
seed implants?

17:24.102 --> 17:25.451
- Well, that's a possibility,
but--

17:25.620 --> 17:28.028
- We'll increase the Flomax,
give him something for the pain.

17:28.122 --> 17:30.439
I don't want him in surgery.
(Billy scoffs)

17:30.441 --> 17:32.550
- She'll kill me before
the cancer does.

17:32.701 --> 17:34.034
(laughing)

17:34.054 --> 17:36.012
Nan, uh...

17:37.540 --> 17:40.308
...what kind of time
am I looking at here?

17:41.043 --> 17:44.437
(soft piano playing)

17:47.125 --> 17:49.975
♪ Every day keeps falling

17:49.977 --> 17:54.322
♪ Faster than the last

17:55.558 --> 17:58.951
♪ But I still can't run faster

17:59.061 --> 18:03.247
♪ Faster than my past

18:04.325 --> 18:08.311
♪ Still haunted by those
memories ♪

18:08.329 --> 18:12.648
♪ Cracked and stained
with my regret ♪

18:12.667 --> 18:19.430
♪ So I'll just keep remembering
to forget ♪

18:21.342 --> 18:26.345
♪ And even when I sleep
your smile is all I dream ♪

18:26.422 --> 18:29.348
♪ Did you really
have to leave? ♪

18:29.425 --> 18:32.259
♪ I'll try to keep remembering

18:32.278 --> 18:38.007
♪ I'll never stop remembering
to forget ♪

18:38.009 --> 18:40.660
(melody fades out)

18:42.180 --> 18:43.346
(sighs)

18:43.364 --> 18:46.124
(Berg): It's an old song,
but it sounds new.

18:46.275 --> 18:48.609
- Right? It's kind of haunting.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.704
- I'm not sure that
a Greatest Hits album

18:51.856 --> 18:52.855
is the right home for it.

18:52.874 --> 18:54.114
- Seriously?

18:54.134 --> 18:57.451
Come on, Bergs, fans live
for long lost songs.

18:57.528 --> 19:00.621
- That's an idea:
The Lost Recordings.

19:00.715 --> 19:03.599
Let's look at it for
that next time around, okay?

19:10.984 --> 19:13.559
You owe me one.
- I know.

19:13.711 --> 19:16.154
But if I'd told him,
it would have crushed him.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.230
- The song isn't
terrible, Billy.

19:18.383 --> 19:21.659
- No. But I don't want "isn't
terrible" on my last album.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.219
- Don't say that.

19:23.237 --> 19:25.997
Even in jest.
- Yeah.

19:28.484 --> 19:30.334
Thanks, Bergs.

19:32.914 --> 19:35.339
(sighs)

19:37.010 --> 19:38.509
- What'd he say?

19:38.661 --> 19:40.178
- Uh...

19:40.329 --> 19:42.180
not gonna happen, kiddo.

19:42.256 --> 19:44.498
- Bergs is an idiot.
- Whoa.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.018
- No, I'm not high.
I'm pissed.

19:47.094 --> 19:48.352
That song is beautiful.

19:48.429 --> 19:50.579
- So we'll...

19:50.598 --> 19:51.931
find a place for it
on the next album.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.416
- That's not true
and you know it.

19:53.434 --> 19:57.028
- Look. I couldn't make this
song work 30 years ago.

19:57.104 --> 20:00.031
It's not your fault.
- Your fans will love it.

20:02.351 --> 20:03.534
- Maybe.

20:04.929 --> 20:06.853
- Right, there it is.

20:07.615 --> 20:09.782
You're the one who doesn't want
the song on the album,

20:09.858 --> 20:10.857
not Bergs.

20:11.452 --> 20:13.502
Why couldn't you just say that?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.589
- Leo.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.384
(sighs)

20:21.779 --> 20:24.096
(big exhale)

20:26.133 --> 20:30.061
- The kid doesn't quit,
I'll give him that much.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.290
Sometimes I think letting
him follow me into music

20:34.292 --> 20:35.900
was the worst mistake
I ever made.

20:35.977 --> 20:39.237
- You couldn't have stopped him.
Kids do what they want.

20:39.464 --> 20:40.887
And Leo's good at what he does.
- He is.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.300
That's why it irks me that he's
content to live in my shadow.

20:44.318 --> 20:48.153
He could get a real gig.
- Well, he wants to be with you.

20:48.306 --> 20:49.580
I thought it was the end
of the world

20:49.657 --> 20:51.474
when he dropped out of college,
remember?

20:51.492 --> 20:54.252
Thought he was messing up
his chances for med school.

20:54.328 --> 20:57.463
Now I'm happy to find him
breathing in the morning.

20:58.499 --> 21:00.332
If he's okay being
in your shadow,

21:00.409 --> 21:02.969
then we should be okay
with it too.

21:04.597 --> 21:08.081
Would it kill you to include
the song on the album?

21:08.159 --> 21:09.583
- No, it wouldn't kill me.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.270
But it's the one thing in
my life that is just mine.

21:12.421 --> 21:13.604
- That's not true.
(scoffs)

21:13.681 --> 21:15.922
- I don't take a dump without
considering

21:16.000 --> 21:17.349
how it's gonna effect that kid.

21:17.502 --> 21:20.019
- I just think this gesture
could make a difference.

21:20.095 --> 21:21.612
- This album is not a gesture!

21:21.764 --> 21:24.690
- I... it's, that's not what
I meant and you know it.

21:24.842 --> 21:28.235
- Look what he's doin' to us.
- He's not doing anything.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.179
You're being selfish.

21:30.181 --> 21:31.772
- Are you kidding me?

21:32.625 --> 21:35.851
I gave up being number one
to you a long time ago.

21:35.944 --> 21:37.277
- Because Leo needs me.

21:37.279 --> 21:39.522
He's needed me for as long
as I can remember.

21:39.524 --> 21:42.525
All the times he came home
wasted and you were on the road.

21:42.618 --> 21:44.860
I've been doing
the heavy lifting here.

21:44.879 --> 21:47.305
I've given up my life for him
and there's nothing left.

21:47.381 --> 21:49.865
- Well, this is my music,
my legacy,

21:49.884 --> 21:52.535
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let him take that away, too!

21:52.537 --> 21:55.128
- Your legacy? You know what
your legacy is?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.588
Your children are your legacy.

21:56.740 --> 21:59.400
You might want to rethink
that, Billy.

22:02.063 --> 22:03.228
- Ready?

22:03.381 --> 22:05.397
- Yeah. Uh, get the tube from
the boathouse

22:05.550 --> 22:06.732
and I'll meet you
in five minutes.

22:06.884 --> 22:08.534
- Okay.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.668
(tense music)

23:00.454 --> 23:02.046
- Nice try, Dad.

23:18.046 --> 23:19.897
- Hey, Bug.

23:20.048 --> 23:21.306
Let me get that.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.983
Thank you.

23:24.812 --> 23:26.612
(effort grunt)

23:27.798 --> 23:29.723
Let's get in the boat.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.150
Hop.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.994
Put your vest on.
- Yep.

23:34.989 --> 23:37.731
(foreboding music)

23:37.750 --> 23:40.626
(beeping)

23:43.481 --> 23:45.005
- Need help?

23:46.150 --> 23:48.342
(whirring)
- Got it.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.388
Oh, sit down.
Sit down.

23:57.419 --> 23:58.919
Let's go tubing.

23:58.996 --> 24:01.087
Woo! Here we go.

24:01.165 --> 24:02.514
(rumbling)

24:02.591 --> 24:05.985
- Daddy, you promise to go
really fast, right?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.504
Really, really fast, okay?

24:08.522 --> 24:10.781
Because whenever Grandpa takes
me he says he goes fast,

24:10.933 --> 24:12.700
but he doesn't.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.332
(Jo Jo grunts)

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
Daddy?!

24:26.373 --> 24:28.023
Daddy?!

24:28.025 --> 24:28.966
Daddy, wake up!

24:29.117 --> 24:30.801
Daddy, wake up!

24:30.878 --> 24:33.620
Daddy, wake up!

24:33.698 --> 24:34.763
Daddy!

24:35.883 --> 24:38.017
(engine stops)

24:38.978 --> 24:41.729
(panicked breathing)

24:50.823 --> 24:54.325
- I'm okay now, I promise.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.085
Get in the water and,
and I'll pull you.

25:06.063 --> 25:07.246
Come on, I'll go really fast.

25:07.398 --> 25:09.381
- Let's just go back.

25:11.585 --> 25:13.260
- Okay.

25:13.754 --> 25:15.221
But...

25:16.574 --> 25:19.742
...we don't have to worry
Grandpa and Grandma

25:19.760 --> 25:22.353
over nothing, right?

25:23.264 --> 25:24.563
Jo?

25:45.861 --> 25:47.545
(sighs)

25:47.772 --> 25:49.672
- Hiya, Anne.

25:50.699 --> 25:52.107
- Dana.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.701
- How've you been?
- Fine.

25:54.779 --> 25:56.053
I'm just fine.

25:57.039 --> 25:58.347
Who's that?

25:58.966 --> 26:00.057
- Pete.

26:00.284 --> 26:02.726
He's my roommate.

26:02.803 --> 26:04.728
- Nice place you got.

26:05.881 --> 26:07.231
- Billy said he spoke to you.

26:08.050 --> 26:10.216
- Yeah, I know.
The thing is, I...

26:10.294 --> 26:13.312
I'm gonna need to talk
to him again.

26:13.388 --> 26:15.656
- Not a good time.
Can I help you with something?

26:17.151 --> 26:20.411
- So, my landlord jacked up
my rent,

26:20.487 --> 26:23.138
claims it's for added
maintenance charges

26:23.140 --> 26:25.398
or hot water or something.

26:26.310 --> 26:31.088
I'm gonna need more
to make the monthly...

26:33.259 --> 26:34.341
- Hm.

26:34.910 --> 26:36.719
(clears throat)

26:37.988 --> 26:39.096
That's not the agreement.

26:39.323 --> 26:41.473
- Yeah, I know.
I know, but...

26:45.087 --> 26:47.253
You know what, since I'm here,

26:47.331 --> 26:51.609
I would really love to say
hi to Jo Jo.

26:51.685 --> 26:53.168
- Wait. Wait.

26:53.187 --> 26:54.987
- Are we cool here?

26:56.173 --> 26:57.597
- I will get you more money

26:57.675 --> 26:59.950
when we see you keeping
your promise.

27:00.102 --> 27:01.677
But I will call the police
right now

27:01.679 --> 27:04.179
if you don't get back
into that van right now

27:04.198 --> 27:06.332
and get the hell out of here.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.460
- Fine.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.337
Dana.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.279
Let's go.

27:13.374 --> 27:16.634
- You tell Billy
I'm gonna see him soon.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.335
Very soon.

27:18.562 --> 27:21.287
(chuckles)

27:21.307 --> 27:22.547
Toodles.

27:22.975 --> 27:27.202
- The motion we're entering
seeks to exclude the testimony

27:27.221 --> 27:28.537
of Dana Carlson's roommate

27:28.555 --> 27:30.797
about incidents unrelated
to the indictment.

27:30.891 --> 27:34.318
- Objection. The testimony about
the Defendant implies pattern.

27:34.395 --> 27:37.154
We hope to show his impulsive
and violent behaviour

27:37.231 --> 27:39.381
in this case
is not an isolated event.

27:39.383 --> 27:41.400
- Your Honour, Dana Carlson

27:41.552 --> 27:43.994
and her roommate are both
drug users,

27:44.146 --> 27:46.664
their testimony should be
disallowed on that basis alone.

27:46.815 --> 27:49.057
- He's got six months
of sobriety under his belt.

27:49.059 --> 27:50.075
- So he claims.

27:50.152 --> 27:52.077
- I'll allow the testimony.

27:52.229 --> 27:54.338
- Uh, Your Honour.
- That's my decision.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.992
- Leo overslept, must have
been up late in the studio.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.428
I told Jo Jo you'd drive
her to school.

28:04.258 --> 28:06.166
What's up?
- Dana was just here.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.093
- When?
- Just now.

28:08.245 --> 28:10.062
She's gone, Billy.

28:12.174 --> 28:14.416
- What'd she want?
- What do you think?

28:14.418 --> 28:17.510
And she was with some new guy
she said was her roommate.

28:18.346 --> 28:21.448
He looked strung out.
He scared me.

28:23.928 --> 28:26.111
- Jo Jo?
- Jo Jo, honey?

28:26.263 --> 28:27.930
Sweetie, what's wrong?

28:27.990 --> 28:30.457
(whimpers)
(trickling)

28:33.212 --> 28:34.461
Baby...

28:35.789 --> 28:37.297
...what's the matter?

28:37.958 --> 28:39.633
You can tell me.

28:51.713 --> 28:53.564
- Thank God.

28:59.797 --> 29:01.655
(grunting)

29:03.075 --> 29:04.700
- What the hell?

29:05.894 --> 29:07.060
- You're using again.

29:07.137 --> 29:09.246
- I was working late
on the song.

29:09.323 --> 29:10.748
- That's the excuse
I used gave your mother.

29:10.899 --> 29:12.899
- It's not an excuse. I have an
idea I think it'd really work.

29:12.977 --> 29:15.401
- Forget the song! I don't want
to hear about the damn song!

29:15.479 --> 29:18.071
- Right.
You never did, did you?

29:18.148 --> 29:20.591
- You almost killed your
daughter!

29:21.502 --> 29:22.926
My granddaughter!

29:23.078 --> 29:24.553
Yeah.

29:26.006 --> 29:27.339
She told us, Leo.

29:27.415 --> 29:30.601
I also know you stole
my cancer meds.

29:32.162 --> 29:33.979
Talk to me, Son.

29:36.333 --> 29:39.067
- I don't think
I'm gonna make it, Pop.

29:46.268 --> 29:48.076
- We'll get you help.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.204
You hear me?

29:51.031 --> 29:53.532
As many times as we have to.

29:54.518 --> 29:57.019
- You should be enjoying
your life with Mom,

29:57.021 --> 30:00.689
not... taking care of a junkie.

30:00.707 --> 30:02.508
- No, no, no.

30:05.529 --> 30:06.695
You're my son.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.389
And we'll get through this.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.393
I promise.

30:15.222 --> 30:17.648
We'll do whatever we have to do.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.806
(sobbing)

30:27.718 --> 30:33.372
- Please don't make me keep
fighting this anymore.

30:35.409 --> 30:36.708
I can't do it.

30:40.989 --> 30:43.674
(rumbling)

30:50.741 --> 30:53.350
(car beeping)

30:53.501 --> 30:56.578
- Hi. Your call scared me.
- Hey.

30:56.580 --> 30:59.022
- I thought that...
- It's not the cancer.

31:00.342 --> 31:02.675
- Then it's Leo.
- Yeah.

31:03.345 --> 31:05.345
- He's using again?
- Yeah.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.699
And then uh... something
happened yesterday that...

31:08.850 --> 31:10.183
- What? What happened?

31:10.202 --> 31:14.204
- Can we talk inside?
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry. Come in.

31:14.431 --> 31:15.947
Why didn't you and mom
call the police?

31:16.066 --> 31:17.265
- And tell them what?

31:17.284 --> 31:18.934
That our ex-daughter-in-law
came to our house

31:18.952 --> 31:21.937
with her new boyfriend?
- They threatened Mom.

31:21.939 --> 31:25.299
- The police can't arrest Dana
for something she hasn't done.

31:26.443 --> 31:28.793
Yeah, she's always been bad
for him,

31:28.870 --> 31:33.298
and now with this guy
and Leo's using again it's...

31:33.450 --> 31:35.225
- Can he go to rehab?
- He won't go.

31:35.377 --> 31:38.061
And to tell the truth, I get it.

31:38.138 --> 31:41.214
It's been a revolving door
for 15 years.

31:41.291 --> 31:42.307
How's this gonna be
any different?

31:42.459 --> 31:45.402
If he's going to fall,
we can't stop him.

31:47.131 --> 31:48.405
- What about Jo Jo?

31:49.224 --> 31:51.483
- We're gonna take full custody,
your mom and me.

31:51.559 --> 31:52.392
- Dad,

31:52.560 --> 31:54.578
you already raised
your children.

31:54.655 --> 31:57.822
- We've talked it through,
it's what we want.

31:57.975 --> 31:59.491
It's the only way

31:59.567 --> 32:02.628
and the lawyers have drawn up
papers relinquishing custody so.

32:04.739 --> 32:05.756
- Does Leo know?

32:05.907 --> 32:07.315
- Not yet.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.094
We'll tell him as soon
as Dana's signed off on it.

32:11.246 --> 32:13.655
- What makes you think she will?

32:13.674 --> 32:15.991
(sighs)

32:15.993 --> 32:17.643
- Well, that's why I'm here.

32:18.829 --> 32:20.162
I know Ted has a gun.

32:20.164 --> 32:22.681
- Dad.
- I'm not gonna use it.

32:22.775 --> 32:27.018
I just don't know how Dana or
this guy are gonna react so...

32:27.095 --> 32:29.262
just let me have the gun, Ro.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.839
No one else needs to know.

32:30.841 --> 32:32.174
- Did you see the defendant
that night?

32:32.192 --> 32:34.009
- Yeah. He just showed up
at our place.

32:34.011 --> 32:35.177
- And what'd he say?

32:35.195 --> 32:37.979
- He wanted Dana to sign
her kid over to him.

32:38.015 --> 32:39.665
- And what happened after that?

32:45.189 --> 32:46.446
- Wow.

32:46.523 --> 32:49.666
If it ain't the famous
Billy Carlson in the flesh.

32:50.252 --> 32:52.118
- I wanna see Dana.
- Hey Dana,

32:52.196 --> 32:54.513
put something on,
your father-in-law's here.

32:55.699 --> 32:57.140
You got our cash this time?

32:58.293 --> 32:59.643
- Yeah.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.371
- So?

33:03.390 --> 33:04.706
- Dana.

33:04.799 --> 33:05.649
- Okay.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.800
I've kept up my end
of the bargain.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.135
Did you bring my money?

33:09.229 --> 33:12.714
- Well, it's a little more
complicated than that now.

33:13.217 --> 33:14.716
- Things got pretty
loud between 'em.

33:14.718 --> 33:16.994
- Between Dana Carlson
and the defendant?

33:17.070 --> 33:18.644
- Yeah.
Especially him.

33:18.722 --> 33:21.072
Thinks just 'cause he's got a
bit of money and some fame

33:21.149 --> 33:22.407
that he can push people around.

33:22.576 --> 33:26.486
- Did Dana Carlson do anything
to provoke the Defendant?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.672
- She stood up for herself,
like anybody would.

33:28.749 --> 33:31.657
She didn't want to be treated,
you know, like crap.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.343
So maybe got a little
physical with him.

33:33.495 --> 33:36.404
- She hit Mr. Carlson?
- It was just a slap.

33:36.423 --> 33:38.573
- And what did Mr. Carlson
do at that point?

33:38.592 --> 33:41.560
- Uh, he... pulled out
a Smith and Wesson.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.521
His hand was shaking

33:44.672 --> 33:47.357
but he said he would use it
unless she signed.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.367
- Leo.

33:58.779 --> 34:00.996
(sighs)

34:06.103 --> 34:07.753
Where ya been?

34:10.290 --> 34:12.791
- Pavun has a bed
for you tomorrow morning.

34:12.943 --> 34:16.303
- You can't stay here anymore.
Not unless you're clean.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.139
- I'm not going back.

34:19.950 --> 34:21.374
Please.

34:21.451 --> 34:23.376
I slipped up
but I'll be better, okay?

34:23.395 --> 34:25.878
- We've been through
this too many times.

34:25.956 --> 34:26.897
- Fine.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.974
I'll just go get Jo Jo
and we'll find another place.

34:30.127 --> 34:31.693
- Jo Jo's not here.

34:33.721 --> 34:35.030
- What?

34:36.466 --> 34:37.390
Where is she?

34:37.467 --> 34:39.076
- With Ramona.

34:39.303 --> 34:41.653
You can't be a parent
to her right now.

34:41.729 --> 34:44.063
We need you to sign
over custody.

34:44.641 --> 34:46.732
- What?
- Just until you're better.

34:46.810 --> 34:51.922
- You need Dana's consent and
she's gone with the wind, so.

34:52.073 --> 34:53.465
- Leo.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.467
Read it.

35:04.328 --> 35:06.436
- What'd you do, Dad, huh?

35:07.331 --> 35:10.515
How did you get this?
- Does it even matter?

35:10.667 --> 35:12.517
Some women aren't meant to be
mothers, she's one of them.

35:12.669 --> 35:14.444
- Where is she?
Tell me where Dana is.

35:14.596 --> 35:17.096
- You don't need her
in your life.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.949
- That is not up to you.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.493
- We are trying
to keep you sober.

35:22.696 --> 35:25.622
- You wanna know why
I'm an addict?

35:27.033 --> 35:30.443
Because I'm suffocating
in this house.

35:30.945 --> 35:35.190
My only escape from the constant
look of failure on your faces

35:35.208 --> 35:38.242
is the high that I think
about night and day.

35:38.244 --> 35:39.803
I'm sorry, it's the truth.

35:39.954 --> 35:43.140
Leo, the underachiever!
Leo, the screw-up!

35:43.142 --> 35:45.033
Does that make you proud now?
Huh?

35:45.051 --> 35:46.050
- Leo.
- Get off me.

35:46.127 --> 35:48.562
(Anne gasps)
- Billy!

35:49.706 --> 35:51.398
- Leo!

35:58.398 --> 36:00.231
- Let's go, we gotta move.
- Where are we going?

36:00.308 --> 36:01.549
- It's a surprise.

36:01.568 --> 36:03.660
You'll just have to find out
when we get there.

36:04.554 --> 36:05.495
Alright, we're leaving.

36:05.647 --> 36:07.980
<i> (Anne): If Leo calls,</i>
<i> don't pick up.</i>

36:08.058 --> 36:09.499
- I won't. Mom...

36:09.651 --> 36:11.150
you and dad are doing
the right thing.

36:11.228 --> 36:13.244
- That doesn't make
it any easier.

36:13.397 --> 36:14.913
<i> - I gotta go.</i>
<i> I love you.</i>

36:15.065 --> 36:16.423
- Love you too.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.235
They're leaving.

36:20.237 --> 36:21.736
- And Leo hasn't showed
up or called?

36:21.829 --> 36:22.737
- No.

36:22.906 --> 36:25.240
- Well, he knows Jo Jo's
with Ramona.

36:25.242 --> 36:27.434
I assumed that'd be
the first place he'd go.

36:28.094 --> 36:29.186
- Do you hear that?

36:29.262 --> 36:30.412
- What?

36:30.430 --> 36:34.524
(Billy's song plays outside)

36:37.437 --> 36:39.938
♪ Still haunted by those
memories ♪

36:40.090 --> 36:41.847
- Oh, no.

36:48.765 --> 36:51.082

37:05.131 --> 37:08.116

37:08.118 --> 37:10.785
Hurry up, please!

37:10.845 --> 37:12.712
Leo!

37:12.789 --> 37:15.398
(tense music)

37:16.793 --> 37:19.277
- No, no, no, no!

37:20.630 --> 37:22.572
Hurry up!

37:23.800 --> 37:26.993
(shaky breathing)

37:29.230 --> 37:30.997
Come on. Come on.

37:39.073 --> 37:40.740
- What are you doing?

37:40.834 --> 37:42.150
He's gonna die!

37:42.152 --> 37:43.885
- That's what he wants.

37:45.246 --> 37:48.431
It's what he's been wanting
for a long time now.

37:48.508 --> 37:51.551
We just haven't been listening.

37:52.178 --> 37:54.521
- No! What did you do?

37:55.832 --> 37:58.692
(sirens approaching)

38:01.262 --> 38:03.613
- Goodnight, my love.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.409
He's gone.

38:08.695 --> 38:11.413
(sobbing)

38:15.535 --> 38:17.702
(footsteps approaching)

38:17.854 --> 38:19.546
(EMT): They're over here.

38:20.373 --> 38:21.706
- Excuse me.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.591
Ma'am, please step away.

38:32.202 --> 38:35.461
- The court has heard
from the witnesses.

38:36.373 --> 38:38.648
Mr. Carlson, would you like
to make a statement?

38:39.376 --> 38:42.277
- No, Your Honour.
- Actually, yes.

38:43.213 --> 38:45.697
I... I have something to say.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.035
- Excuse me, Miss.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.220
Miss.
- Don't touch me.

38:52.238 --> 38:54.389
- I can't let you go in there.

38:54.391 --> 38:56.649
- That's my father-in-law
on trial.

38:56.668 --> 39:01.320
- I have a lot of regrets
about how we raised our son.

39:01.398 --> 39:03.247
How we struggled
with his addiction.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.676
I blame myself for not being
able to do more,

39:07.995 --> 39:10.588
to keep him from ruining
his life.

39:10.740 --> 39:14.684
Not once, but six,
seven, eight times.

39:14.836 --> 39:17.437
We were drained, all of us.
(door opens)

39:21.418 --> 39:23.360
- Murderer.

39:24.011 --> 39:26.654
(whispering)

39:35.281 --> 39:40.192
- It may seem cruel,
but I loved my son.

39:40.270 --> 39:43.046
I loved him so much.

39:43.865 --> 39:45.507
I just...

39:46.443 --> 39:48.426
I didn't know how to save him.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.629
It was all I thought about.

39:51.706 --> 39:54.206
All... all any of us
ever thought about.

39:54.284 --> 39:57.118
Every minute of every day,
it was always there.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.562
Along with the helplessness

40:01.066 --> 40:03.483
and the fear
of not knowing when.

40:06.963 --> 40:08.479
Letting Leo go

40:09.466 --> 40:12.992
was the only way to allow
my family to live.

40:20.310 --> 40:23.086
(Anne whimpering, crying)

40:24.147 --> 40:26.314
- I... couldn't, I...

40:26.332 --> 40:28.407
- She... she tried to...

40:28.485 --> 40:31.319
she tried to save him,
she really tried, I just...

40:31.412 --> 40:32.429
I couldn't let her.
- Billy.

40:32.505 --> 40:34.914
- It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

40:34.991 --> 40:38.083
I won't be around forever

40:38.161 --> 40:40.344
but as long as I'm here,

40:40.497 --> 40:42.330
I can't keep putting you
and Jo Jo through this.

40:42.348 --> 40:45.275
That little girl,
she's gonna need you.

40:45.426 --> 40:48.653
(cries)

40:52.117 --> 40:54.008
- William Carlson, please rise.

40:54.027 --> 40:56.936
Mr. Carlson, I have no doubt

40:57.013 --> 40:58.955
that you and your family have
suffered a great deal.

40:59.106 --> 41:00.290
But you, sir, are not God.

41:00.517 --> 41:04.202
The law prohibits you from
preventing someone else

41:04.296 --> 41:06.111
from saving another's life.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.189
When you broke the syringe,
you broke the law.

41:08.208 --> 41:11.617
Much as I sympathize
with your anguish,

41:11.695 --> 41:15.046
it is not this court's place
to forgive you.

41:15.198 --> 41:17.140
My hands are tied here, sir.

41:18.702 --> 41:22.553
This court has taken into
account your declining health

41:22.630 --> 41:25.815
in determining a sentence
of four years.

41:25.967 --> 41:27.484
(crowd gasping)

41:27.635 --> 41:30.061
I take no joy in acknowledging
for you,

41:30.137 --> 41:32.155
this may well be a
life sentence.

41:32.232 --> 41:34.716
This court is adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

41:34.734 --> 41:35.975
- No!

41:36.052 --> 41:39.144
(cameras shuttering)

41:39.498 --> 41:43.074
(handcuffs clicking)

41:43.150 --> 41:45.001
- Your Honour,

41:45.078 --> 41:47.003
may I give my wedding band
to my wife?

41:47.080 --> 41:48.505
- Bailiff.

42:02.929 --> 42:04.169
(Anne cries)

42:04.189 --> 42:05.980
- Jo Jo needs you now.

42:08.009 --> 42:11.528
(soft music)

42:17.260 --> 42:18.993
(Bailiff): It's time.

42:24.951 --> 42:29.087
(cameras shuttering)

42:41.893 --> 42:44.310
- Grandma, look at this.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.638
A real beauty, huh?

42:47.715 --> 42:51.025
(laughing): Yeah, a real beauty.

42:52.070 --> 42:55.655
