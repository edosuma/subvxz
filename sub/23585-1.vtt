00:03.637 --> 00:06.772
     (dramatic drumbeat)

00:10.011 --> 00:13.645
  (anxious electronic music)

00:31.032 --> 00:33.298
          (gasping)

00:43.711 --> 00:47.046
     (heartbeat pounding)

01:06.834 --> 01:11.437
 - Everybody, everybody,
 hey, I want to make a toast.

01:12.606 --> 01:17.443
Get your glasses up, I wanna
make a toast to my friend Jeff.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.612
     He's a lucky guy and
     I'm happy for him.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.782
     Not everybody gets a
     chance at happiness.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.753
  You think you're gonna be
  happy and shit happens.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.155
     You know how it is,
     we've all been there.

01:30.858 --> 01:31.857
         And tonight,

01:34.095 --> 01:37.362
 I'd like to remember the
 people that can't be with us.

01:38.365 --> 01:42.234
      To absent friends
      and happy futures.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.503
  To Jeff and Abby, cheers.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.406
          Congrats.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.844
    I'm happy for you, okay?

01:51.846 --> 01:55.814
 Seriously, I'm a little
 jealous but I'm really happy

01:55.816 --> 01:57.416
     and let me buy you
     guys some drinks now.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.651
     - No, we're good.
     - Oh, will you shut,

01:59.653 --> 02:00.986
     what, you don't think
     I can afford it?

02:00.987 --> 02:02.320
 - No, it's not that at all.
 - I can afford it.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.256
  No, it's fine, it's fine.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.692
            Barkeep,

02:06.693 --> 02:09.127
     give this guy Dr. Jeff
     whatever he wants.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.231
     You can put it on
     my tab, 'kay, okay?

02:13.267 --> 02:15.267
      And if you want a
      little (snorting),

02:15.269 --> 02:16.535
      you know where to
      get it, I got you.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.870
     - Yeah, we're good.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.238
     - [Katrina] Gwen, hi.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.808
             - Hi.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.876
         - How are you?

02:23.878 --> 02:25.511
      It's been so long.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.145
    - I'm just trying to
    get another drink here.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.213
 - Have you talked to Abby yet?

02:28.215 --> 02:30.799
        She's so sweet.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.384
  - I'm sure she is but I
  haven't had the privilege.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.454
     - Oh, I saw your mom
     when I was in town.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.840
         - Lucky you.

02:37.841 --> 02:40.225
  - She's still so beautiful
  and such a sweetheart.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.793
      She told me you're
      writing a novel.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.295
     - Oh god, she won't
     shut up about that.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.997
  - It's so perfect for you.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.698
     I remember how much
     you used to talk about

02:46.699 --> 02:48.399
 how you wanted to do writing
 and you were so good.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.969
 Everything you wrote in class

02:49.970 --> 02:51.537
      was like way above
      everybody's head.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.839
    - What are you drinking?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.574
         - Club soda.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.909
  - I think you're confused.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.928
      That won't get you
      drunk and there's

02:58.929 --> 03:00.946
 no way we're getting
 through this weekend sober.

03:02.616 --> 03:06.285
 - I'm having a great time,
 it's nice to see everybody.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.855
  - Well, have a drink with
  me, for old time's sake.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.856
         - I'm driving.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.691
          - Driving.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.361
 - Gwen, I want to talk to you.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.599
- We're talking now, what's up?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.734
 - I mean like actually talk.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.537
     Go out and get dinner
     like we used to.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.246
 - I prefer to live in the now.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.618
 - Last week of senior year,
 if I remember correctly,

03:39.620 --> 03:42.754
    you and Katrina hooked
    up in the reptile room.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.840
     Can you confirm it?

03:44.841 --> 03:46.925
      - I will not ever
      say that happened.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.730
  I remember Dave, he threw

03:51.732 --> 03:54.366
      a beer into the
      monkey cage, dude.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.767
      - And it was like
      (whistling) boom.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.406
             Dave,

04:01.408 --> 04:05.577
  we invited him, we did,
  it's just it's a little--

04:05.579 --> 04:06.845
         - I know, man.
         - Yeah.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.783
     Yeah, is it a little
     awkward with Katrina?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.954
     - No, write that in
     hieroglyphics, it's
     ancient history.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.392
  You know what I'm saying?

04:20.394 --> 04:24.429
 (muffled relaxed guitar music)

04:31.005 --> 04:33.172
         - [Jeff] Gwen.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.340
  - Hi.
  - I'm so glad you're here.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.276
      - I didn't think
      I'd make the cut.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.180
    - You need to meet Abby.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.882
    Abby, this is Gwen, an
    old, old friend of mine.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.986
     - Long time friend.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.021
  - Nice to meet you, Jeff's
  told me a lot about you.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.356
      - I'll try to live
      up to the hype.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.628
 - So good to see you, I miss
 you, I hope you know that.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.731
    - Yeah, I miss you too,

04:59.733 --> 05:00.866
         you know, I--

05:00.868 --> 05:05.370
 - Hey, I didn't want to
 interrupt the writer at work.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.040
    You know, Gwen is
    working on a novel now.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.509
 - Well then, I look forward
 to reading your message.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.645
  - Well, I look forward
  to knowing what to write.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.580
    So that makes two of us.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.385
         - Excuse me.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.086
 - So nice to meet you.
 - You too, congratulations.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.489
             - Hey.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.490
             - Hey.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.662
     - Look at them,
     the perfect couple.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.331
 - I give it a year and a half.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.634
        Two years, max.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.537
  - Your family got in okay?

05:38.538 --> 05:40.572
 - Yeah, everyone's good, so
 looking forward to tomorrow.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.291
          - Me too.

05:42.292 --> 05:44.009
 - Did you get a chance to
 catch up with the old crew?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.822
     - They're not
     really my old crew.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.634
 - Oh come on, are you kidding?

05:47.635 --> 05:49.446
 You never really had a crew,
 this is as close as it gets.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.017
  - Well I did get ambushed
  by some old woman.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.986
         - A cougar?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.954
     - She was like 70,
     that would be gross.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.356
      - Beggars can't be
      choosers, right?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.757
     Sorry for sticking
     you guys way out there

05:58.759 --> 06:00.659
     at Abby's uncles
     place but I figured

06:00.661 --> 06:02.894
  they could use the
  chance to save the hotel.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.864
 Like Matthew, I love the dude

06:05.866 --> 06:08.400
but has he ever had a real job?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.487
     - Yeah man, I got you.

06:11.488 --> 06:13.505
 I'm out of town until
 Monday but when I get back,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.508
      yeah, yeah, I got
      you man, eighth,

06:16.510 --> 06:18.510
     half ounce, whatever
     you want, man.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.511
        All right, cool.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.515
            Oh hey.
            - Hey.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.484
     I think I'm gonna
     bring the car around.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.387
 Do you want to let everybody
 know that we're ready to go?

06:28.922 --> 06:29.921
            - Yeah.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.173
      (hard rock music)

06:48.175 --> 06:50.008
  - Are we recording again?
  - We're recording.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.411
 - I had so much fucking fun.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.646
 - Oh my god, did you see Erin?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.081
 He looks like fuckin' 50 now.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.049
     - Oh, shut up Dave,
     they were so awesome.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.819
 - Yeah, they were so awesome
 Dave, thank you very much.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.555
 - He was totes, totes awesome.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.961
      Hey, why don't you
      get a room, dude?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.463
 - [Matthew] I'm telling you,

07:11.465 --> 07:13.565
     she's never down
     for it though I try.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.834
 - Why do I always get stuck
 in the back with these guys?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.103
     - Because we're hoping
     magic's gonna happen.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.841
  - Get in here.
  - I don't want AIDS on me.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.609
      - Bitch you could
      not handle AIDS.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.144
      Looks, AIDS, AIDS.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.982
          - Oh god.
          (laughing)

07:30.984 --> 07:32.484
     - We're so rude.
     - Not a compliment.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.453
        - We're in love.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.921
      (tires screeching)

07:35.923 --> 07:38.457
          (crashing)

07:42.930 --> 07:44.763
 - [Gwen] Is everybody okay?

07:45.732 --> 07:46.998
             Dave?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.633
      Dave?
      - Don't touch him.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.801
        Just stay back.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.737
        (sirens blaring)

08:41.655 --> 08:43.922
          (wailing)

08:50.697 --> 08:52.531
- Hey, hey, this child was meant

08:52.533 --> 08:55.634
    to come into this world
    and join this family.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.569
 We're all waiting for it, eh?

08:57.571 --> 08:59.237
        You just have to
        show it the way.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.307
      - [Anne] I can't,
      it hurts too much!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.675
         (screaming)

09:03.677 --> 09:06.295
 - You're creating life, Anne.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.914
 That's what gods do and gods
 don't feel pain, now push.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.284
          That's it.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.019
        Push, that's it.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.087
    Push, a little farther.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.690
          That's it.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.028
     One more, one more.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.266
     That's it, that's it.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.267
          Oh my god.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.704
         You did it.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.240
         (baby crying)

09:37.811 --> 09:40.812
      (elated laughing)

09:53.961 --> 09:55.594
     - Wow, this is cool.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.129
  - Who's up for a nightcap?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.734
    - I know we have to get
    up at like 9:00 a.m.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.870
     - Yeah, my stomach's
     like not great.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.939
     - What, are you
     pregnant or something?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.613
 - Come on guys, we haven't
 seen each other in forever.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.847
     We'll just do a toast.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.951
- I guess a toast would be fine.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.620
  - Look, it's a '68 Merlot.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.622
     When are we ever gonna
     drink that again?

10:23.624 --> 10:26.257
    - I'm not sure we should
    be drinking their wine.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.728
     - Abby's uncle did say
     "Mi casa es su casa."

10:29.730 --> 10:31.029
  - [Matthew] So it's fine.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.067
         - Thank you.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.005
     - Guys, we've known
     each other forever

10:40.007 --> 10:43.942
 and I can't remember not
 being friends with you guys.

10:44.911 --> 10:45.877
             So,

10:47.180 --> 10:48.647
         here's to us.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.015
            - To us.
            - To us.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.051
      (glasses clanking)

10:58.058 --> 10:58.924
      - [Matthew] Tunes.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.791
 - I'm actually gonna turn in.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.704
         Yeah.
         - All right.

11:01.705 --> 11:03.049
 - [Katrina] I'm kinda tired,
 have a nice night, though.

11:03.050 --> 11:04.394
         - Goodnight.
         - Goodnight.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.232
    - Okay, want some more?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.768
      - No, no, I have
      an early morning.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.738
    - Yeah, we all have to
    get up at the same time.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.443
    (relaxed ensemble music)

11:18.445 --> 11:20.078
      - Yeah, goodnight.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.315
             - God.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.051
         - All right.
         - Wow.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.888
    - Well then let's drink.

11:37.431 --> 11:38.430
          - Spencer?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.234
         Sweet room.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.069
      - Yeah, they know
      me really well.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.805
    - Jeff told me that you
    finished your residency.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.339
That's awesome, congratulations.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.307
          - Thanks.

11:51.111 --> 11:54.112
  - I've spent a lot of time
  searching for my purpose.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.847
It's nice that you found yours.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.483
  - I don't know, my
  grandfather was a doctor,

11:58.485 --> 12:00.385
 both my parents are doctors.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.854
     - Have you ever wanted
     to be anything else?

12:03.857 --> 12:06.441
      - I never really
      thought about it.

12:06.442 --> 12:09.026
     - [Matthew] Spencer is
     such a ween-bag, dude.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.030
  - Oh my god, you're awful.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.733
- Oh, no more for me, I don't...

12:15.869 --> 12:17.836
         (chuckling)

12:17.838 --> 12:19.871
 - My stomach hurts, oh my god.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.439
     - [Matthew] They're
     such a bore, man.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.858
         - They are.
         - Whatever.

12:23.859 --> 12:26.276
     - That fucking, she
     sucks, she sucks.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.747
             Sucks.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.933
            I mean,

12:31.934 --> 12:33.417
  she's just, what happened?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.887
 - You guys don't talk anymore?

12:36.456 --> 12:37.422
             - No.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.761
    The last time I saw her
    was like two years ago.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.295
 We had dinner and she wouldn't

12:44.297 --> 12:47.398
     shut up about her
     New Age witchy stuff.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.902
    I don't think I'd fit
    in with her new outlook.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.773
     - I haven't talked to
     her in a long time.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.709
 - What happened with you guys?

12:57.710 --> 12:59.343
     For like years, you
     were inseparable.

12:59.346 --> 13:03.815
 Like literally, it was
 embarrassing and then poof,

13:03.817 --> 13:04.816
         it was over.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.088
     Let me rephrase, how
     did you screw it up?

13:15.562 --> 13:20.064
     I'm sorry, I just, I
     just figured that--

13:20.066 --> 13:22.066
     - [Matthew] It's fine.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.377
 - I loved you guys together.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.378
            That and

13:35.115 --> 13:37.215
 after Dave, it was too much.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.058
 Well, we gotta get up early so

13:48.461 --> 13:50.495
     I still have to get
     my three pages in.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.299
 - Oh yeah, yeah, your book.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.433
I saw your mom's post about it.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.302
         - Not you too.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.407
        (glasses clank)

14:03.443 --> 14:06.227
      - I have something
      I want to tell you

14:06.228 --> 14:09.012
 and it might sound weird
 but try to be open about it.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.115
            - Okay.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.490
      - I've been seeing
      an energy healer,

14:18.491 --> 14:21.459
 trying to focus myself on a
 more clear, positive path.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.862
            - Cool.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.098
  - And part of my practice

14:26.099 --> 14:28.333
  is opening up to energies
  from outside myself.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.136
 I've been in touch with David.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.407
 - I don't really think we
 should be talking about this.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.459
 - I can sense you're feeling

14:38.460 --> 14:40.510
 all this guilt about the
 accident and what happened.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.413
    But it's not your fault.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.515
     He knows that, you
     don't have to worry.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.218
- Great, thanks for the update.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.921
     - I'm serious, I want
     to help you let go.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.422
         - I'm fine.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.423
            Really.

14:53.927 --> 14:54.926
          It's fine.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.495
    - You don't believe me.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.997
    - Go to his mom's house.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.066
      Hang out with him
      for a little bit.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.476
  He's brain dead, Katrina.

15:13.914 --> 15:17.315
    The guy that we know is
    gone completely, 100%.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.919
         He's a shell.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.605
     - I don't think
     you could say that.

15:23.606 --> 15:26.290
 - It sucks but what you're
 talking about is impossible.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.458
     - You have to look
     beyond what you can--

15:27.460 --> 15:29.260
- Who here has a medical degree?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.434
         - It's late.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.669
     I should go to bed.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.204
         - Goodnight.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.208
     - It's gotta be hard
     doing what you do.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.577
Everybody's really proud of you.

16:02.362 --> 16:06.497
(low, anxious electronic music)

16:09.336 --> 16:10.952
     - [Gwen's Voiceover]
     The moment he arrived,

16:10.953 --> 16:12.569
 he knew there was
 something about this place.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.640
  Things are possible here.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.243
 The past, present and future

16:19.245 --> 16:22.113
     exist together and
     we can change them.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.649
         He told her,

16:24.651 --> 16:27.518
  "Here, it has to be here.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.988
     "Can't you feel it?"

16:31.057 --> 16:32.457
            - Here,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.659
 it has to be here, this spot.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.661
  Come on Derek, I need you.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.162
  - Are you sure about this?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.697
    - Hey, do you trust me?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.699
     - Well, yeah I just--
     - Hey, look at me.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.201
        Do you trust me?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.287
            - Yeah.

16:46.288 --> 16:48.038
  - [Frazer] You have a
  pain in your heart, Derek.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.678
 Do you remember the moment
 everything went wrong for you?

16:55.482 --> 16:56.681
         Yeah, you do.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.317
     Bring out that pain,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.453
         take us there.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.422
     Let us make it right.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.631
     (children shouting)

17:16.069 --> 17:21.204
        - Frazer!
        (voice echoing)

17:22.442 --> 17:26.577
 - Okay, go back to the house
 and have Don look at this.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.781
    - Maya, did you feel it?

17:29.783 --> 17:32.150
- You're a sick, sadistic child.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.418
    - When the blood was
    drawn, did you feel it?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.253
     Everything trembled.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.688
         I saw Bobby.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.658
I can save him, I can save him.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.060
      - Everybody is
      talking about you,

17:42.062 --> 17:44.062
 Frazer, they're scared of you.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.329
             - No.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.664
         They trust me.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.183
             - No.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.701
 - No one cared about me from
 before but they believe in me.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.638
  They'll do anything I say.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.007
    - When we started this,
    I thought you cared

17:56.008 --> 17:58.375
     about them but they're
     just lab rats to you.

17:58.378 --> 18:02.380
 You need to look deep inside
 and realize what you're doing.

18:02.382 --> 18:06.284
     - This is gonna work,
     this is gonna work.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.220
     I saw Bobby.
     (ominous whispering)

18:09.222 --> 18:10.221
          I saw him.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.762
         (screaming)

18:39.786 --> 18:40.785
        - [Matthew] Hey.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.388
             - Hey.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.625
        - Are you okay?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.659
         - I'm fine.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.395
        - Are you sure?

18:51.397 --> 18:54.799
     - I'm just tired,
     I'm gonna go to bed.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.318
     - Well I've got
     some weed in my room

18:57.319 --> 18:58.835
     if you want to smoke
     some before you go.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.173
  - I don't do that anymore.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.278
     But I'd love to talk
     with you though.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.653
     (anxious rock tones)

19:40.446 --> 19:42.880
    - You know, I'm not
    addicted like some guys.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.881
            I just,

19:43.883 --> 19:49.654
  sometimes I don't know
  how you do it, that's all.

19:51.958 --> 19:52.957
         - It's hard.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.426
     Especially tonight,

19:56.462 --> 19:58.196
          seeing you

19:58.198 --> 20:00.498
      and Gwen and Jeff.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.203
     It brings back a lot.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.875
 - So, are you seeing anyone?

20:11.778 --> 20:12.777
             - No.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.747
    I am trying to learn how
    to be happy on my own.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.850
- I'm glad you had that choice.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.321
      - What about you?

20:24.290 --> 20:26.357
- You know, everyone that I ask

20:26.359 --> 20:27.792
 about you says the same thing.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.694
     Like I'll ask, "How's
     Katrina doing?"

20:29.696 --> 20:30.661
      And they're like
      "Oh, she's good."

20:30.663 --> 20:33.364
    Or "She looks so happy."

20:34.400 --> 20:36.767
  - I don't know about that.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.938
  I'm trying, really,
  really hard to be better.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.006
      But it's not easy.

20:42.008 --> 20:46.244
  - Well you know, actually
  I was seeing this girl

20:46.246 --> 20:48.546
      and she was so hot
      and just awesome.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.251
 But it wasn't the right
 time, so I just broke it off.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.388
(light anxious electronic tones)

21:01.294 --> 21:03.461
     - [Spencer's Father]
     Hey bud, it's 7:30.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.263
     Since when do you go
     to sleep this early?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.664
 - [Spencer] My teacher said

21:06.666 --> 21:08.466
     Santa won't come
     until I go to sleep.

21:10.670 --> 21:14.472
    - She was lying to you,
    there is no Santa Claus.

21:14.474 --> 21:18.276
 He's a myth that they made up
 to keep kids from misbehaving.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.094
     Now your mother and
     I will be giving

21:20.095 --> 21:21.911
     you presents no matter
     when you go to sleep.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.814
     - [Young Spencer] What
     about the reindeer?

21:23.816 --> 21:26.317
 - Oh Christ, these schools.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.954
 Prove to me that Santa exists.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.822
    - [Young Spencer]
    Everyone believes in it.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.426
- Well, people believe in a
lot of things that aren't true.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.828
     Santa doesn't exist.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.500
  God doesn't exist and the
  ones who believe in him

21:42.502 --> 21:46.570
 are suckers and fools and
 are only lying to themselves.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.973
      Never forget that.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.876
          All right.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.944
     Why don't we have
     a little ice cream?

21:59.619 --> 22:02.453
    - [Gwen] So the story
    is about this one family

22:02.455 --> 22:04.355
     over hundreds of
     years and the way that

22:04.357 --> 22:08.926
  each generation, you know,
  like screws up the next.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.728
 - That's really nice, sweetie.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.964
    It sounds great, I'm
    really excited for you.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.734
 - I don't know why I bother
 telling you anything.

22:16.736 --> 22:20.371
     You don't get it,
     dad would understand.

22:20.373 --> 22:25.509
    So even though it's in
    different time periods,

22:26.079 --> 22:28.579
 it's all connected, you know?

22:29.749 --> 22:32.983
  - That sounds like a fine
  idea but to be honest,

22:32.985 --> 22:36.354
    who has time for fiction
    when the government

22:36.356 --> 22:39.623
     is stealing our
     rights as free people?

22:39.625 --> 22:42.360
 Stealing our civil liberties.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.595
      Gwen, you need to
      read this article.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.397
     - I'm gonna talk
     about all of that but,

22:46.399 --> 22:48.532
     and the whole thing's
     very allegorical--

22:48.534 --> 22:52.503
 - I'm sure it is but let me
 find this article for you.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.839
     - Dad, if you would
     just look at my notes,

22:54.841 --> 22:58.743
     I mean I would really
     love your feedback.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.778
 It would mean the world to me.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.713
            Please?

23:03.716 --> 23:07.651
 (light anxious guitar tones)

23:24.670 --> 23:28.139
    (low demonic whispering)

23:38.985 --> 23:42.553
     (ominous rising tones)

23:44.123 --> 23:46.690
          (growling)

23:50.062 --> 23:52.096
          (gasping)

23:52.098 --> 23:54.432
    - Katy, hey, hey,
    whoa, whoa, what is it?

23:54.434 --> 23:56.567
      Hey, what's wrong?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.469
     You're shaking, look
     at me, look at me.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.604
      Hey, hey, you're
      fine, you're safe.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.707
     You're safe, it
     was just some wind.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.218
         Are you sure?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.589
 - It was my second test, so.

24:20.726 --> 24:23.928
     I don't want you to
     think, I didn't...

24:26.599 --> 24:28.933
     I just wanted to
     tell you before I--

24:29.769 --> 24:31.101
      - Before you what?

24:32.939 --> 24:34.505
     - We can't keep it.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.607
        We're not ready.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.477
 - But we're lucky to be alive.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.681
    I mean this is
    happening for a reason.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.117
  We could have a family
  together, we can be happy.

24:48.754 --> 24:51.655
 - I didn't, (chuckles) I
 didn't think that you would--

24:53.626 --> 24:55.826
     - Hold on a second.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.862
 Here we go, look, okay, look.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.497
     You deserve so much
     better than this.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.499
 So, so much better than this

25:01.501 --> 25:03.651
 but I don't want to spend
 another minute without knowing

25:03.652 --> 25:05.802
  that I'm gonna be with you
  for the rest of my life.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.606
 I love you, will you marry me?

25:11.110 --> 25:12.643
         - Yeah, yeah.

25:18.284 --> 25:21.819
     (relaxed guitar tones)

25:37.003 --> 25:38.202
        - Hey, sweetie.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.772
     - [Gwen's Voiceover]
     Mom, is that you?

25:42.942 --> 25:44.642
  Why do you look so young?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.243
 - Do you want some breakfast?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.313
    - [Gwen's Voiceover]
    My mother is beautiful.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.015
    Everyone always says so.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.091
Everyone falls in love with her.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.566
 - You know, your father and I

26:08.568 --> 26:11.001
      are going to a
      gala this weekend.

26:11.003 --> 26:15.105
    You should see the dress
    I bought, it is so cute.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.576
Speaking of cute, that boy Jeff,

26:18.578 --> 26:20.177
is he coming by, by any chance?

26:21.981 --> 26:23.347
That's crazy, are you a trainer?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.583
     - Yeah, I could give
     you a free session.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.301
         - You would?
         - Yeah, sure.

26:27.302 --> 26:29.018
     - I would love that.
     - So would I.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.589
  - This is Gwen, hey Gwen,
  say hi to the nice man.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.023
        - Hi, hey Gwen.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.925
     Is this your sister?

26:34.926 --> 26:36.826
- Oh, come on, it's my daughter.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.129
     - I don't believe you.
     - You're stupid.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.998
     You wanna go tonight?
     - Yeah, sure.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.335
 - [Gwen's Voiceover] You
 were corrupt, you were wrong,

26:44.337 --> 26:48.005
     you were born out
     of transgression and
     you were tainted.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.007
 You will always be tainted.

26:53.879 --> 26:54.878
         - Breakfast.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.722
        You look tired.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.993
      (raspy breathing)

27:08.995 --> 27:10.995
  Why don't you try harder?

27:10.997 --> 27:12.863
 You need to apply yourself.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.816
     (demonic whispering)

27:15.817 --> 27:17.900
 Are you sure you're
 getting enough sleep, Gwen?

27:17.903 --> 27:19.903
     You look really tired.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.040
     - [Gwen's Voiceover]
     I'm your mother.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.779
 - Your father and I love you.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.783
 I just want you to be happy.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.920
     What's wrong with you?

27:38.791 --> 27:43.327
         (scream)
         (shattering)

28:01.881 --> 28:04.281
         (trickling)

28:07.319 --> 28:10.220
        (toilet flushes)

28:12.858 --> 28:15.125
            (thud)
            (grunt)

28:15.127 --> 28:18.228
 - [Samantha] Derek, get in
 here, help me tie this guy up.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.265
 - [Matthew] Hi Mrs. Bayles,

28:21.267 --> 28:23.117
     can I talk to
     Katrina you please?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.968
    - [Katrina's Mom] No,
    now is not a good time.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.338
     - Look, I've been
     calling her all day.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.240
 - [Katrina's Mom] She is
 feeling really ill right now

28:30.242 --> 28:32.843
  and it's not a really good
  time to be talking to her.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.978
     - [Matthew] I'd rather
     hear it from her.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.414
    - [Katrina's Mom] Matt,
    it is not a good time.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.149
        If you come back
        some other day--

28:39.151 --> 28:41.135
 - [Matthew] I know you
 don't like me, that's fine.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.120
  But this is my family
  we're talking about, okay?

28:43.122 --> 28:44.588
- [Katrina's Mom] I understand,

28:44.589 --> 28:46.055
      I need for you to
      just consider--

28:46.058 --> 28:47.825
     - [Matthew] No, I want
     to talk to Katrina.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.478
      Katrina, Katrina?

28:50.479 --> 28:53.130
 - [Katrina's Mom] She's not
 ready to talk to you, Matt.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.687
     - [Matthew] I just
     want to talk to her.

28:54.688 --> 28:56.243
      - No.
      - She'll tell me.

28:56.244 --> 28:57.799
  - [Katrina's Mom] She has
  asked me to tell you no.

28:57.803 --> 28:58.969
             - Mom.
             - Hey.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.739
      - [Katrina] Can
      we have a minute?

29:02.975 --> 29:04.975
         Mom, please.

29:04.976 --> 29:06.976
  - All right, I'll be
  right here if you need me.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.747
            - Okay?

29:09.749 --> 29:11.315
      Hey, what's wrong?

29:11.317 --> 29:13.217
     I wanted to show
     you something, okay?

29:14.754 --> 29:15.786
        - I miscarried.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.022
            - What?

29:19.024 --> 29:20.023
          - Uh-huh.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.192
          Just today

29:23.229 --> 29:24.228
             and

29:24.230 --> 29:28.332
 because of that, I don't think
 that we should get married.

29:29.435 --> 29:33.203
     - Katy, I wasn't lying
     about what I said.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.873
    I love you and I want to
    take care of you, okay?

29:36.942 --> 29:38.258
     Please don't do this.

29:38.259 --> 29:39.575
     - [Katrina] I have to
     think about things.

29:39.576 --> 29:40.892
 I'm sorry, I just need time.
 - Please.

29:40.893 --> 29:42.209
    - [Katrina] I don't
    think it's a good idea.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.081
      - Katrina, please.
      - I'm sorry.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.553
         (wind howling)

29:52.324 --> 29:53.791
         - I was gonna,

29:56.929 --> 29:59.196
  I was gonna give you this.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.200
         I would have.

30:48.981 --> 30:49.947
             - Hey.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.866
         Who are you?

30:52.867 --> 30:55.117
     - I was just looking
     for the owners.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.554
      Hi, I live nearby,
      my name's Frazer.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.490
            - Gwen.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.458
         - Hi, Gwen.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.094
 It's a pleasure to meet you.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.196
     - We're just staying
     here this weekend.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.537
     - Rough night, huh?

31:14.540 --> 31:17.007
- I guess I'm a bit of a klutz.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.443
 - That's okay, I forgive you.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.646
- [Gwen] Here, let me help you.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.553
 - So what brings you out here?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.355
- It's my friend Jeff's wedding.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.326
     - You don't seem all
     that excited about it.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.928
     - Well honestly, it's

31:40.299 --> 31:41.899
 a little hard to deal with.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.239
     - Why, you used to
     have a thing for him?

31:51.911 --> 31:54.344
        Hey, it's okay.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.479
     We've all been there.

31:55.481 --> 32:00.017
We try so hard to hold on to
the things that hurt us, right?

32:00.019 --> 32:03.921
     The pain, the anger,
     the bad experience.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.058
Why not just let that wash away

32:09.428 --> 32:11.061
  so that we can be reborn?

32:13.232 --> 32:18.168
 - Exactly, it's like we're all
 prisoners of other's choices.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.636
            - Yeah.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.339
    - It's kind of like this
    book I'm working on.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.308
      - I knew you were
      the creative type.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.981
 Tell me more about your story.

32:30.983 --> 32:31.982
          - Really,

32:34.086 --> 32:36.453
 no, you don't want to hear it.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.988
          - Please.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.356
            Tell me.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.357
            - Okay.

32:40.359 --> 32:46.563
 Well, it's about one family
 across hundreds of years

32:47.733 --> 32:50.701
 and the way that each
 generation fucks up the next.

32:50.703 --> 32:51.668
            - Right.

32:51.670 --> 32:55.072
     Right, parents damage
     their children.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.240
 They put all their failures
 and insecurities onto them.

32:57.242 --> 33:00.243
    By the time we've grown
    up, the damage is done.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.080
I would totally read that book.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.215
        (Gwen chuckles)

33:05.217 --> 33:10.153
     Imagine if we could
     do it a different way.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.223
      What if we grew
      up in a collective

33:14.126 --> 33:16.343
     where we're surrounded
     by a diversity

33:16.344 --> 33:18.561
     of people and got to
     make our own choices?

33:18.564 --> 33:22.666
That's basically what my friends
and I are doing out here.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.067
            - Yeah?

33:24.069 --> 33:26.269
- Well, I call them my friends.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.638
     Really they're
     more like a family.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.639
            We'd do

33:30.676 --> 33:33.010
    anything for each other.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.515
    Well, I'll leave you be.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.553
         - [Gwen] Hey.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.554
            - Yeah?

33:46.091 --> 33:48.258
     - You wanna have a
     glass of wine with me?

33:50.396 --> 33:51.661
         - I'd love to.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.315
         (baby cooing)

34:31.536 --> 34:34.404
        (ominous tones)

34:55.860 --> 34:57.594
     It has to be tonight.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.230
     Everything is aligned.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.569
      I need volunteers.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.549
            Alicia.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.284
 (Alicia exclaims excitedly)

35:22.287 --> 35:23.286
             Brian.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.293
        (ominous tones)

35:41.607 --> 35:42.740
             Dawn.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.874
  You'll be accompanying me.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.349
         - He chose us.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.751
 I can't believe he chose us.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.424
      - [Frazer] This is
      heavy stuff, Sam.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.494
      I'm gonna need you
      with me on this.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.366
        - [Samantha] Get
        her in here now.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.703
  Did you see the others?
  - Oh, you mean the bodies?

36:13.705 --> 36:15.405
      - [Samantha] They
      chose to be here.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.873
     - [Derek] They
     didn't choose that.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.625
 - [Samantha] Frazer told me

36:18.626 --> 36:20.376
  they are a small
  sacrifice to get us here.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.845
 - I'm gonna go into the dark.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.783
      I'm gonna need you
      to be my light.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.485
     - [Samantha] We have
     to save his brother.

36:28.487 --> 36:33.190
     Then we can save them,
     we can save everyone.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.392
 - There's no sacrifice too big

36:35.394 --> 36:37.361
 to get us where we want to be.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.329
 - Who the hell is this guy?
 - Just calm down, okay?

36:39.331 --> 36:41.565
 Everything is under control.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.634
 Frazer wants us to keep him

36:43.635 --> 36:44.935
      contained and find
      out what he knows.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.970
     - He told you that?
     - Just trust me.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.606
    I think this guy's FBI.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.876
     Look at this, I mean
     what is this thing?

36:52.878 --> 36:55.212
    - [Derek] I don't know,
    what happened out there?

36:55.214 --> 36:59.316
 I mean this is the house
 but everything's different.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.750
         Where are we?

37:00.752 --> 37:03.486
          (sneezing)

37:03.488 --> 37:06.489
    - Look, please, just
    take anything you want.

37:06.491 --> 37:09.826
 I won't tell anyone, I
 promise, please don't hurt me.

37:09.828 --> 37:10.827
      - Don't hurt you?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.396
     Why would we hurt you?

37:15.234 --> 37:16.766
     - [Spencer] You
     broke into the house.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.368
      - We didn't break
      into the house.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.003
  You broke into the house.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.851
          - Sam.
          - Shut up.

37:22.852 --> 37:25.698
  - Look, there's obviously
  been a mix-up, okay?

37:25.699 --> 37:28.545
 Just let me get my glasses
 and I will go, it's all yours.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.281
  - What do you think, that
  I'm stupid or something?

37:31.282 --> 37:32.782
     We know that you've
     been watching us.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.485
    Frazer sees everything.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.521
  - Please, just let me go.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.523
            - Stop.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.525
     We're not murderers.

37:42.527 --> 37:45.528
 I don't even know what's
 happened with the two of you.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.031
 - We can't trust Maya on this.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.169
         It's just us.

37:53.170 --> 37:54.436
  - I didn't want to do it.

37:54.437 --> 37:55.703
     I liked that little
     girl, I liked--

37:55.704 --> 37:56.970
      - Shut up.
      - I know, I know.

37:56.975 --> 38:00.944
But it wasn't your choice, it's
not your fault, it's Frazer.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.483
             God.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.552
    You're so much like him.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.988
    He was a scientist too.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.494
  He wanted to help people.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.628
             Here.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.597
         (Maya groans)

38:20.598 --> 38:22.565
- Maya, you're still
delirious, you should sit down.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.002
  - [Maya] No, no, he's
  here, he's gonna hurt her.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.939
      - [Samantha] Maya,
      Maya, talk to me.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.841
      - [Derek] I don't
      know what to do.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.548
    - [Katrina] I feel kinda
    bad for him actually.

38:38.550 --> 38:43.320
 He's smart but just can't--
 (eerie whispering)

38:43.322 --> 38:44.721
      You need to get
      your act together.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.623
      What are you doing
      with your life?

39:01.773 --> 39:03.406
     - Cheers, Gwendoline.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.643
     - My dad's the only
     one who calls me that.

39:07.612 --> 39:11.414
     - You're right, you're
     not a Gwendoline.

39:11.416 --> 39:12.982
  You have a different name.

39:12.984 --> 39:13.983
          - Oh yeah?

39:14.753 --> 39:15.752
            - Maybe

39:17.489 --> 39:18.688
             Siren.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.856
             - Ooh.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.458
            - Yeah.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.360
     The siren's an
     ancient Greek myth.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.862
  A beautiful woman calls to
  the men with a lovely song

39:25.864 --> 39:28.598
    and when they come to
    her, she eats 'em alive.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.102
     - Well I call and
     they don't pick up.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.670
      - [Fazer] What
      happened with this

39:33.672 --> 39:35.372
 groom to be, this Jeff fella?

39:36.775 --> 39:39.376
     - I don't know, he's
     a good looking guy.

39:40.379 --> 39:44.647
     I had feelings for him
     for a long time and I

39:44.649 --> 39:47.384
    just kept wishing
    something would happen.

39:47.386 --> 39:50.387
        Then one day, we
        were at a party.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.857
    (electronic dance music)

40:02.100 --> 40:06.136
  Everything felt so right
  and Jeff was drawn to me.

40:06.138 --> 40:10.407
 The way he looked at me, I was
 waiting for that for so long.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.041
 I never really liked dancing.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.677
I usually felt so self-conscious

40:14.679 --> 40:17.614
     but in that moment,
     I could move.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.183
         I felt free.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.257
 - So we totally got abandoned.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.825
    - [Gwen] Yeah, where
    did all our friends go?

40:28.827 --> 40:31.861
 - I turned around and it
 was like boom, they're gone.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.663
          (laughing)

40:33.664 --> 40:35.464
- [Jeff] Wow, did you ever shake
it in there, that was wild.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.100
     - Yeah, you weren't
     so bad yourself.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.768
 - Yeah and I'd do it again.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.175
 - I liked dancing with you.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.583
 - It's funny 'cause I think,

40:54.719 --> 40:56.486
well, I should probably go home.

40:57.889 --> 40:58.922
        - Yeah, me too.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.127
  - [Jeff] So my car's over
  here, where is yours?

41:04.129 --> 41:05.995
     - Oh, just that way.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.897
      - Do you want me
      to walk you there?

41:07.898 --> 41:09.798
 - Oh no, no, I'm cool, you go.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.468
     - Okay.
     - I'll see you later.

41:13.738 --> 41:16.105
    - The next thing I know,
    he's dating my friend

41:16.107 --> 41:18.875
      and I had to watch
      them together,

41:18.877 --> 41:21.211
    all over each other and
    I couldn't even be mad

41:21.213 --> 41:24.914
    because I was so stupid
    in that one moment.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.435
     - [Former Classmate]
     Yo, I think it's that

41:28.436 --> 41:30.053
 stuck up cunt from high
 school with that hot ass mom.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.621
- Hey girl, is that sexy ass mom

41:31.623 --> 41:33.490
of yours comin' to pick you up?

41:33.492 --> 41:34.757
  - [Gwen] Shut the fuck up.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.893
     Who the fuck are you?

41:36.894 --> 41:39.028
  Get the fuck out of my
  face, you mother fuckers.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.163
 - Yo man, her mom is so
 fuckin' hot, she's kinky too.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.633
    - [Man] Good to see
    you, tell mom I said hi.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.171
     - Years later, I
     heard Jeff was single

41:48.173 --> 41:51.107
 and we were all supposed to
 go to this concert together.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.909
But he bailed at the last minute

41:52.911 --> 41:55.512
      and our friend
      Dave came instead.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.183
     There was an accident.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.520
     Dave was paralyzed.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.042
         A week later,

42:09.043 --> 42:10.893
    Jeff shipped off to the
    Caymans for med school.

42:12.063 --> 42:16.533
  Katrina and Matthew broke
  up and she got weird.

42:20.605 --> 42:21.971
          God, I...

42:27.078 --> 42:29.679
  I thought we'd be friends

42:30.649 --> 42:31.648
          for life.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.321
          - Come on.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.126
     Come dance with me.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.728
 (relaxed jazzy guitar music)

42:45.730 --> 42:47.063
  - It's just not my thing.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.699
      - Yeah, I used to
      be like that too.

42:49.701 --> 42:54.037
  Afraid to dance, afraid
  to ask for what I wanted.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.573
     You know what I found?

42:56.575 --> 42:59.175
     If you ask people the
     right way, they'll do

42:59.177 --> 43:02.845
    anything you want and if
    you think in a new way,

43:02.847 --> 43:05.582
 you can do anything yourself.

43:05.584 --> 43:07.116
 So maybe Gwen doesn't dance.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.086
     But how about Siren?

43:12.724 --> 43:13.856
     - That's not my name.

43:19.798 --> 43:22.932
     (low anxious tones)

43:41.353 --> 43:44.954
    (steady tempo drumbeat)

44:14.953 --> 44:15.952
            - Siren.

44:16.755 --> 44:17.920
         Siren, Siren.

44:19.758 --> 44:20.957
     She's a great dancer.

44:22.794 --> 44:26.195
        The best dancer.
        (voice echoes)

44:30.068 --> 44:32.201
      I'm very familiar
      with these moves.

44:32.203 --> 44:34.871
      These are the I'm
      scared to dance

44:34.873 --> 44:36.406
 and I'm scared to dance moves.

44:38.743 --> 44:39.842
  - I'll show you something.

44:45.250 --> 44:48.451
     (relaxed rock music)

45:00.365 --> 45:02.965
         (screaming)

45:11.443 --> 45:16.779
 - You know, you don't have to
 be that old person anymore.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.415
 You could redefine yourself.

45:21.453 --> 45:24.854
 Now I'm not going to do it
 for you, but you'll regret it.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.162
      - That felt good.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.297
     I wanna do it again.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.842
         (screaming)

45:50.482 --> 45:53.750
      (eerie whispering)

45:58.223 --> 46:01.891
    (dramatic ominous tones)

46:06.998 --> 46:09.332
          (growling)

46:20.912 --> 46:24.180
      - [Samantha] Maya,
      Maya, talk to me.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.882
  - I don't know what to do.

46:25.883 --> 46:27.583
      - She's having an
      epileptic seizure,

46:27.584 --> 46:29.284
    she needs to be sedated.
    - Don't trust him.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.087
     - If you don't sedate
     her immediately,

46:31.088 --> 46:32.888
    she could suffer
    permanent brain damage.

46:33.892 --> 46:36.359
  I'm a doctor, let me help.

46:37.862 --> 46:40.329
         (Maya gasping)

46:40.331 --> 46:41.330
            - Don't

46:42.200 --> 46:43.432
         try anything.

46:52.277 --> 46:53.876
      - Do you have any
      medical supplies?

46:53.878 --> 46:55.344
 Anything like a tranquilizer?

46:59.484 --> 47:00.449
      - Will this work?

47:04.088 --> 47:05.555
      - Is this heroin?

47:05.557 --> 47:07.824
 - [Samantha] Just help her.

47:07.826 --> 47:10.526
- [Spencer] Maya, I'm gonna
need you to relax for me, okay?

47:10.528 --> 47:12.995
      I'm gonna need you
      to breath deeply.

47:13.865 --> 47:15.498
- Thank you for doing this, man.

47:16.434 --> 47:18.000
  I'm sorry she tied you up.

47:25.877 --> 47:27.009
         Is she okay?

47:28.880 --> 47:31.380
 - The only certainty is
 that nothing is impossible.

47:31.382 --> 47:32.515
        I can see time.

47:32.517 --> 47:36.385
 Scientists weren't meant
 to maintain the status quo,

47:37.555 --> 47:39.488
 they were meant to destroy it.

47:39.490 --> 47:42.124
  I can see the future here.

47:42.126 --> 47:44.026
  - We could save the world.

47:44.028 --> 47:46.295
     - We could save Bobby.
     - Bobby,

47:47.098 --> 47:48.064
         are you okay?

47:49.033 --> 47:50.833
     What's wrong with him?

47:50.834 --> 47:52.634
 - [Frazer's Mom] Frazer, you
 were responsible for him.

47:52.637 --> 47:54.754
 You should have known better.

47:54.755 --> 47:56.872
 You're his big brother, you're
 supposed to look out for him.

47:56.875 --> 47:58.507
     - I may need your
     help with something.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.310
 It may be a little dangerous.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.445
     - Anything for you.

48:04.349 --> 48:06.015
 - Sam, I want you to cut her.

48:06.017 --> 48:08.084
            - What?

48:08.085 --> 48:10.152
     - Cut her arm gently
     but make it bleed.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.687
     - What she is doing?

48:11.688 --> 48:13.221
    - Trust her, we're
    doing this to help you.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.892
         (screaming)

48:15.894 --> 48:17.026
         - I see it.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.194
    - Tell me what you see.

48:18.196 --> 48:20.429
    - I can't, it's blurry.

48:20.431 --> 48:21.430
         - Sam, harder.

48:23.067 --> 48:24.166
     - What are you doing?

48:24.168 --> 48:25.368
      - Don't stop her.

48:26.604 --> 48:29.372
As time collapses, the boundary

48:29.374 --> 48:32.608
 between the subconscious and
 the conscious break down.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.077
     I saw the past today.

48:35.079 --> 48:36.445
     - Make her go away,
     make her stop!

48:38.049 --> 48:40.183
        - [Frazer] Sam.

48:40.184 --> 48:42.318
     We won't just see it,
     we're gonna touch it

48:42.320 --> 48:45.154
  and we're gonna change it,
  we're gonna make ripples.

48:50.595 --> 48:51.394
      Take her to Maya.

48:51.395 --> 48:52.194
 Tell her it was an accident.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.196
     Why are you pushing
     yourself away from us?

48:54.198 --> 48:56.599
     We love you--
     - Because this is not

48:56.601 --> 48:58.000
      why we came here.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.202
      - You're my angel.

49:02.240 --> 49:05.174
  - I don't like it when you
  touch me, don't touch me.

49:06.377 --> 49:09.378
  - [Frazer] This is gonna
  work, this is gonna work.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.479
          (weeping)

49:10.481 --> 49:11.981
     This is gonna work!

49:13.418 --> 49:15.952
          (snarling)

49:21.960 --> 49:23.526
     - Yeah, just lay back.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.094
 Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

49:25.096 --> 49:28.331
      - No, no it won't,
      I can see it all.

49:28.333 --> 49:32.635
     Gwen, Katrina,
     Matthew and Spencer.

49:32.637 --> 49:35.004
  He wants to kill you all.

49:35.005 --> 49:37.372
 - Okay, all right, you need
 to get the fuck out of here.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.141
 I don't know what kinda crazy
 drug bullshit this is but--

49:39.143 --> 49:41.110
 - No one is going anywhere.

49:42.513 --> 49:44.714
    - Sam, you have to face
    it, Frazer's dangerous.

49:44.716 --> 49:47.516
     You can't trust him.
     - You shut up.

49:48.519 --> 49:52.121
     If what he said isn't
     true, how are we here?

49:52.724 --> 49:54.390
     You saw what happened.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.625
      We moved in time.

50:01.632 --> 50:02.631
         - It's here.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.035
      This is the place.

50:13.478 --> 50:17.446
     Energy cannot be
     created or destroyed.

50:19.617 --> 50:21.150
      Only transformed.

50:22.387 --> 50:25.688
     (eerie ensemble music)

50:28.760 --> 50:30.326
         Your sacrifice

50:32.163 --> 50:33.195
      is our salvation.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.467
        - What is it?
        - Just take it.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.478
        - [Frazer] Don't
        be afraid, Dawn.

50:51.149 --> 50:52.548
  I'd never lead you astray.

50:53.384 --> 50:55.618
          (gasping)

50:57.188 --> 50:59.455
          (choking)

51:00.792 --> 51:03.459
 It only hurts for a moment.

51:03.461 --> 51:04.460
         Remember that.

51:10.268 --> 51:12.334
     It's beautiful,
     they're transcending.

51:17.675 --> 51:20.109
         (screaming)

51:20.111 --> 51:21.343
             - No!

51:21.345 --> 51:22.344
             No!

51:24.549 --> 51:27.083
  - Dawn, don't abandon me
  when I need you the most.

51:28.352 --> 51:31.487
     (fearful breathing)

51:32.723 --> 51:33.722
         Come to me.

51:36.627 --> 51:37.626
         Come to me.

51:47.839 --> 51:49.171
      Show me your hand.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.412
  I thought you trusted me.

51:57.348 --> 52:00.249
 Please, we're so close, Dawn.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.652
      I can save you, I
      can save everyone.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.256
 - Dawn, get away from him now!

52:09.594 --> 52:12.394
      Look what you did,
      they trusted you.

52:20.671 --> 52:23.139
          (choking)

52:27.645 --> 52:30.212
      You're a murderer.

52:30.213 --> 52:32.780
 - I didn't do anything, I
 just asked and they answered.

52:33.718 --> 52:37.286
     (tense ensemble tones)

52:39.157 --> 52:40.156
         Just watch,

52:41.692 --> 52:43.192
      it'll be worth it.

53:01.179 --> 53:02.178
         Time is fluid.

53:02.880 --> 53:03.913
         I can feel it.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.350
      You're not Bobby.

53:12.823 --> 53:15.424
     This isn't where
     we're supposed to be.

53:15.426 --> 53:17.193
    Something's gone wrong.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.461
          (choking)

53:26.337 --> 53:28.370
    - I just feel so
    embarrassed telling you

53:28.372 --> 53:32.841
 all this personal stuff and I
 don't know anything about you.

53:33.878 --> 53:36.412
    - Most people just wait
    for their turn to talk.

53:36.414 --> 53:37.446
      I like to listen.

53:38.482 --> 53:40.049
  I like to get to know more

53:40.050 --> 53:41.617
      about someone than
      just the surface.

53:43.254 --> 53:45.221
     - Well, I'd like
     to get to know you.

53:45.890 --> 53:48.757
Why don't you tell me a secret?

53:49.727 --> 53:51.293
  - I had a younger brother.

53:52.263 --> 53:53.262
             - Had?

53:53.864 --> 53:54.863
            - Polio.

53:54.865 --> 53:59.335
     - Polio, wasn't that
     cured like 50 years--

53:59.337 --> 54:00.953
      - We'd snuck away
      from my parents

54:00.954 --> 54:02.570
     and went swimming
     in this dirty river.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.241
  Everyone was doing it but
  we weren't supposed to.

54:06.777 --> 54:09.912
He got worse and worse until
they stuck him in an iron lung.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.785
    - I'm so sorry, I didn't
    mean to bring it up.

54:16.787 --> 54:18.721
    - I'd have done anything

54:18.722 --> 54:20.656
     to get him out of
     that box, anything.

54:23.494 --> 54:27.863
But I was powerless and everyone
blamed me for it happening.

54:31.802 --> 54:34.370
     I didn't come to
     terms with it until

54:34.372 --> 54:37.573
     years later, when I
     had my first trip,

54:38.509 --> 54:39.508
         then I saw.

54:40.678 --> 54:41.744
      - [Gwen] Saw what?

54:43.648 --> 54:46.098
         - Everything,

54:46.099 --> 54:48.549
  I was on the outside
  looking in at all of time

54:48.552 --> 54:50.953
    and I saw Bobby and me
    walking into the river.

54:51.956 --> 54:53.956
     I could almost reach
     out and touch it.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.293
Tell me Siren, is there anything

54:57.295 --> 54:58.994
      in your life you'd
      want to change?

55:00.498 --> 55:04.333
     - That's not my
     name, my name's Gwen.

55:04.335 --> 55:05.334
            - Gwen,

55:06.003 --> 55:07.303
         Gwendoline.

55:08.706 --> 55:11.407
  Does that make you
  uncomfortable, Gwendoline?

55:12.843 --> 55:15.978
 - I told you, my dad's the
 only one who calls me that.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.613
 - Tell me what you'd change.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.717
        I see it there.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.919
     Tell me what it is.

55:26.057 --> 55:27.056
            Tell me!

55:30.328 --> 55:31.527
         - Everything.

55:32.863 --> 55:36.732
    My name is Gwen, I have
    a family who loves me.

55:38.336 --> 55:39.335
             Yeah.

55:39.337 --> 55:41.337
          (moaning)

55:41.339 --> 55:43.605
          (smacking)

55:43.607 --> 55:45.474
     I'm such a bad girl.

55:48.112 --> 55:50.379
        Such a bad girl.

55:50.381 --> 55:52.348
     Your mother doesn't
     care about you,

55:52.350 --> 55:54.083
      she doesn't even
      know you're there.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.828
     Your father hates you.

56:05.830 --> 56:08.497
    He thinks you're stupid,
    don't you get that?

56:10.968 --> 56:13.035
      I have friends
      who care about me.

56:13.904 --> 56:15.771
  They don't care about you.

56:15.773 --> 56:19.041
They don't think about you,
they don't even know you exist.

56:20.411 --> 56:22.144
     You owe them nothing.

56:23.147 --> 56:26.081
     I'm a writer, I have
     something to say.

56:26.083 --> 56:27.850
  Don't fool yourself, Gwen.

56:27.852 --> 56:29.718
 You'll never finish that book.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.921
     How long have you
     been working on it?

56:31.922 --> 56:34.123
  You'll never do it, you'll
  never amount to anything.

56:34.125 --> 56:38.660
    Gwen can never be
    happy, it doesn't exist.

56:38.662 --> 56:41.163
         (screeching)

56:43.601 --> 56:47.636
- This is the moment we were
scarred and we're long past it.

56:48.773 --> 56:51.940
 But what if we could fold time

56:53.077 --> 56:55.677
      and change it so
      it never happened?

56:56.914 --> 56:59.431
     - But I'd never exist.

56:59.432 --> 57:01.949
 - You're wrong, you'd still
 exist but without the scars.

57:02.787 --> 57:04.770
 You'd be the person you were

57:04.771 --> 57:06.754
     meant to be, not
     this tarnished angel.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.125
    - Yeah, my dad didn't
    even want me to be born.

57:12.696 --> 57:16.632
 - You carry the guilt
 inside you, just like I do.

57:18.502 --> 57:19.835
    But we can change that.

57:19.837 --> 57:24.440
     I can save my brother,
     you can save yourself.

57:24.442 --> 57:26.542
      - What am I doing?

57:26.543 --> 57:28.643
     I don't even know you.
     - No, no, no, no, no.

57:28.646 --> 57:30.012
  That's the scars talking.

57:31.715 --> 57:35.451
Are you so afraid of seeing the
person you were meant to be?

57:40.658 --> 57:42.124
- [Gwen] What was in that wine?

57:44.161 --> 57:46.161
     - [Frazer] You'll see.

57:48.999 --> 57:52.034
    - No, I'm so sweaty and
    I'm so fat right now.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.202
  - You're probably the
  most beautiful thing ever.

57:53.204 --> 57:55.003
 - How do you put up with me?

57:55.005 --> 57:56.071
      - I love you more.

57:58.742 --> 57:59.775
         - I love you.

58:02.012 --> 58:03.579
  Come on, let's go inside.

58:03.580 --> 58:05.147
     - No, no, wait, wait
     wait, this is what it

58:05.149 --> 58:07.583
  would've looked like,
  this is what we would've,

58:08.819 --> 58:11.253
 this is how we would've been
 if you hadn't a miscarried.

58:15.226 --> 58:16.225
            Katrina,

58:17.695 --> 58:19.895
      when you lost the
      baby, you changed.

58:23.968 --> 58:25.868
      I wish it didn't
      happen like that.

58:26.637 --> 58:27.769
         - It didn't.

58:30.140 --> 58:31.139
            - What?

58:32.877 --> 58:34.510
 - I never had a miscarriage.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.184
     - What are you saying?

58:42.186 --> 58:43.919
 - I don't want to lie to you.

58:43.921 --> 58:45.921
      I told my mom that
      it was my body

58:45.923 --> 58:48.790
    and it was my choice
    and I could do it but...

58:48.792 --> 58:50.626
     - [Katrina's Mom] I
     want to talk to you,

58:50.628 --> 58:52.828
as a friend, not as your mother.

58:52.830 --> 58:57.065
     I got pregnant way too
     young, just like you.

58:59.570 --> 59:02.804
     I got a promise from
     a boy that he would do

59:02.806 --> 59:07.943
 the right thing and he tried
 but your father was a child.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.046
         You know him.

59:14.018 --> 59:16.952
        I sacrificed and
        I worked so hard

59:18.289 --> 59:20.022
     and I don't regret it

59:20.023 --> 59:21.756
     but it was to give
     you something better.

59:22.760 --> 59:26.094
     I beg you to consider
     whether you want

59:26.096 --> 59:29.831
     one choice you make
     at such a young age

59:31.769 --> 59:36.271
to define the rest of your life.

59:40.844 --> 59:41.910
         She was right.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.612
      - No, she wasn't.
      - Yes, she was.

59:43.613 --> 59:45.313
Think about it, we were so young

59:45.316 --> 59:46.982
and everything was so messed up.

59:46.984 --> 59:49.151
     You didn't have job,
     you didn't graduate

59:49.153 --> 59:51.186
     high school but
     you're still dealing.

59:51.188 --> 59:53.855
 Where were we gonna raise
 the kid, your mom's basement?

59:53.857 --> 59:55.691
    - It wasn't your choice!

59:55.693 --> 59:58.894
     (mid tempo drumbeat)

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:03.231
        - Hey, sweetie.

01:00:04.635 --> 01:00:06.702
      I found your scarf
      in the laundry.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:11.173
It's falling apart a little
bit, I wanted to fix it for you.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.142
 I almost just threw it out.

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:18.280
 Gwen, I'm worried about you.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.217
          You just,

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.886
        you seem so sad

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.055
         all the time.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:32.160
 I just want you to be happy.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:36.331
     I don't know why you
     can't just be happy.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:37.800
- One more, one more, one more.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.268
     Come on baby, you
     got it, you got it.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.736
     You can do it, you can
     do it, you can do it.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.903
      Come on, come on.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.906
  Oh my god, you can do it.

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:49.311
     You come here acting
     so much better than me

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.647
and you make me feel like dirt.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:55.851
 You don't even look at me and
 you won't talk to me, huh?

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:57.986
             Huh?

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:01.123
 - [Nancy] What are you doing?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.124
          You're 30,

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.226
         you're single

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.963
      and you're a temp.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.667
     Where did I go wrong?

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.738
     You were such a
     beautiful little girl.

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:21.009
    I just wish we could go
    back to the old days.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.781
You know, when I was your age--

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.383
         (Gwen screams)

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.019
             - Sam.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.954
        Sam, look at me.

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:34.089
             Sam,

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:38.543
             Sam.

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:39.226
  We got into this for love.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.963
     To help other people.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:47.402
     Frazer's lost sight of
     that, but I haven't.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.407
      - Frazer said you
      would betray us.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:56.445
         Look at you.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:59.915
 Everything he says is true.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:00.982
         Everything.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:06.188
  - Look, look at us, look.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.456
     That would've been us.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:12.194
     Why won't you, why
     don't you just look?

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:13.195
             Huh?

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:15.997
      Would that have
      been so bad, huh?

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.135
      Am I so bad, am
      I so fucking bad?

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:24.473
             Huh?

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:27.208
  Why did you never tell me,
  why didn't you tell me?

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:31.096
 You just didn't give a shit.

01:02:31.097 --> 01:02:34.148
  You didn't tell me, you
  didn't give me the chance.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.250
         Guess what?

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.920
     This time, you
     don't get to choose.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.188
         - Matthew, no.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:43.425
     - What are you doing?

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:47.028
  Gwen, what are you doing?

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.897
 Oh god, what are you doing?

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.266
 No, wait, wait, wait, no, no.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.835
         (screaming)

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:58.140
 Why are you doing this, Gwen?

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.512
    - [Maya] It's okay,
    it's gonna be all right.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.014
 - Do it, Sam, do it for me.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:11.119
     (tense ensemble music)

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.455
          (gurgling)

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.964
    - Hey, we did it, babe.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:39.347
             Stop.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.882
             Stop.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:43.151
          (choking)

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:48.390
         (screaming)

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:52.093
    - [Nancy] Please, I love
    you, I love you, please.

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:53.829
        Please, please.

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:55.330
  - If you really loved me,

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.400
  you never would've brought
  me into this world.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:02.504
         (scream)
         (squelching)

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.973
      - No, no, no, no.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.308
        No, no, no, no.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.827
             No.

01:04:08.828 --> 01:04:11.345
 No, no, no, please, please,
 chill out, chill out.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.849
          (gurgling)

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:22.924
          (weeping)

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.301
     - I made the choice.

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:49.284
             - Shh.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:56.224
  You sacrificed her memory,
  you're almost there.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.399
      I want to show you
      a new life now.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:08.470
 The one where you are the
 person you were meant to be.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.006
          (smacking)

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.176
     You are a siren now.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:23.685
 - [Gwen] God, you are so dumb,
 you are so fucking stupid.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:25.387
 Like what is wrong with you?

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.557
 - [Frazer and Gwen] I'm
 the only one who wants you.

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:31.993
I'm the only one who loves you.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:34.029
I'm the one who sees you, Siren.

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.631
     I'll make all the
     bad feelings go away.

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:40.035
      - [Gwen] You just
      have to let go.

01:05:43.006 --> 01:05:45.073
     - [Frazer] You just
     have to surrender.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.342
     Now tell me your name.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.011
         - [Gwen] Gwen.

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:51.646
 - [Frazer] Tell me your name.

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:55.216
        - [Gwen] Siren.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.488
 - [Frazer] Tell me, do you
 feel better, do you feel free?

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:06.227
          (weeping)

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:16.471
            - Maya.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.975
             Maya.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.211
         Maya, help.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:24.446
 - Oh my god, oh my god,
 Frazer, you're still alive.

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:26.715
            - Maya.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.190
          (groaning)

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:38.159
        I need a doctor.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.579
- There are no doctors out here.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.998
 You said we take care of our
 own, that's what you said.

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.333
     - I didn't say that.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.034
     - You did, when
     Jenny's baby was sick,

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:49.671
  you said you would handle
  it but the baby died.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:53.375
  - I'm not Frazer, I don't
  even know who he is.

01:06:54.378 --> 01:06:58.646
     - Oh my god, you're
     right, you're not.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:01.716
      - Direct pressure.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:04.152
      - What?
      - Direct pressure.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.255
  Anterior abdominal wound.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:11.292
  This much blood loss, the
  odds of survival are...

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.549
          (snarling)

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:37.318
- [Samantha] Frazer, is that...

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:40.789
         Is that you?

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.061
     - [Demon] Sacrifice.

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:49.564
         (crunching)

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.816
         (screaming)

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:24.631
     - I don't relish this,
     but it's the only way.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.203
     (tense dramatic tones)

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:30.104
      I wasn't meant to
      go here, Siren.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.874
I was meant to go to my brother.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:35.310
     But the pain that you

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.745
     and your friends felt
     pulled me to you.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.419
 We are meant to be together.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:49.524
Help me make one last sacrifice

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:52.359
      to send us where
      we're meant to be,

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:55.395
    so we can fix everything
    once and for all.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.305
          (growling)

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.707
        - [Demon] Hurry.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.163
      - [Maya] You have
      to open your mind

01:09:13.165 --> 01:09:14.680
      to the possibility
      that you can live.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.551
    - What did you give me?
    - Relax.

01:09:17.888 --> 01:09:20.255
    It's just a little
    jarring the first time.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.656
          - Aspirin?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:22.657
         - [Maya] Acid.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:28.363
 (eerie ominous ensemble tones)

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:36.904
     (car horns honking)

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:39.340
      (engine rumbling)

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.408
 - Stab wound to the abdomen,

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.477
with that much blood loss, odds
of survival are negligible.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.747
  - Spencer, I can help you,
  you just have to trust me.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:48.216
     - Our best hope, he's
     paralyzed for life.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:49.451
      At worst, he dies.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:50.685
     - [Maya] Spencer
     trust me, I can help.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.453
      - What's to help?

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.221
  It's just the drugs
  talking, you're not real.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.907
     - Everything is real,

01:09:55.908 --> 01:09:57.591
     I can save you here
     or you can die here.

01:09:57.594 --> 01:10:00.195
 There is more to life than
 what you see with your eyes.

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:06.701
          (snarling)

01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:11.706
         (shattering)

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:23.751
  - [Gwen] Do it now, Siren.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.821
     He's a small sacrifice
     to save so much.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:31.926
         Do it, Siren.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.228
         - Do it Siren,

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:35.763
         Do it for me.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:41.002
     - [Demon] I'm sorry.

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:43.504
          (growling)

01:10:51.448 --> 01:10:52.413
          - Stop it.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:55.650
             Help.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:58.753
        Please help me.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.372
      (Katrina wailing)

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.910
            (smack)

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:26.714
  (anxious electronic music)

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:39.927
     - [Gwen] Listen to it.

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:51.673
             Do it.

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.975
             Do it.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.076
             Do it.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:56.311
             Do it.

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.312
             Do it.

01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:02.417
        Do it.
        (phone buzzing)

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.420
          (weeping)

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.822
         (screaming)

01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:16.631
 - Hey man, you've gotta chill.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.536
     This shit with
     Katrina is messed up,

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.737
 nobody's denying it but do
 you want to be 70 and still

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.741
  pissed off that some girl
  lied to you way back when?

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:29.744
      (distant screams)

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.450
     What are you doing?

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:37.652
     I thought I was the
     one who got paralyzed.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:42.457
  (anxious electronic music)

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:51.999
      - [Katrina] Help.

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:01.509
            - Katy.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:03.845
          (snarling)

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.129
            Help me.

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.103
      - [Demon] Help me.

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.570
    - [Katrina] I just don't
    think it's a good idea.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.607
    I need time, I'm sorry.
    - Please.

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:38.112
  (anxious electronic music)

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:52.427
    - Matthew, I never
    should have lied to you.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.629
        I was so scared

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.597
     and I'm so, so sorry.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.600
          (gurgling)

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.568
            Matthew?

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:03.871
            Matthew.

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:06.140
          (choking)

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.645
      (raspy breathing)

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:15.917
             Stop.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.739
     I'm not afraid of you.

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:41.075
          (snarling)

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:46.080
    (anxious ensemble music)

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:08.669
         (shattering)

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:15.910
        (phone buzzing)

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.219
    - [Nancy] Hey, sweetie.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:26.988
             Hello?

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:28.956
         Hello, Gwen?

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:31.792
     Gwen, can you hear me?

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.296
     - Is she there or not?
     - I don't know.

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:37.565
 Honey, can you hear me, Gwen?

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.322
             Gwen?

01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:46.106
     Sweetie, can you hear
     me, are you okay?

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:54.081
     - Hi.
     - Oh, there you are.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.950
  I guess it's bad
  reception in the country.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.652
      How are you doing?

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:01.445
            - Okay.

01:16:01.446 --> 01:16:03.202
     - [Nancy] Listen, I
     just wanted to call

01:16:03.203 --> 01:16:04.959
  and see how the weekend's
  going, are you having fun?

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:07.195
            - Yeah.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:08.629
 - [Nancy] Oh, dad wanted to
 talk to you for a second.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.064
      Let me put him on.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.632
  - [Gwen's Dad] Gwendoline,
  you remember Jane,

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:14.168
     Michael's friend who's
     the literary agent?

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.687
            - Yeah.

01:16:15.688 --> 01:16:17.205
 - [Gwen's Dad] She said she'll

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.723
     take a look at your
     book when it's ready.

01:16:18.724 --> 01:16:20.241
 I don't know if there's gonna
 be a publishing industry then

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.109
     but it's worth a shot.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.046
     - [Nancy] We won't
     take up all your time.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.981
 Have fun at the wedding, tell
 Jeff congratulations for me.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.349
          - I will.

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:30.017
 - [Gwen's Dad] Love you, bye.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:35.890
        (anxious tones)

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.095
  - Spencer, you can choose.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:16.330
     - Shut up, you're
     high, you're not real.

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:18.065
    - You don't have to die.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:22.036
     - I'm sorry, there was
     nothing we could do.

01:17:22.038 --> 01:17:23.771
  The blood loss was just--

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:28.175
     - She's right,
     anything can happen.

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:31.646
     - No, no, this is it,
     I don't want to go.

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:33.814
      (engine rumbling)

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.149
     - Spencer, look out!

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.319
      (tires screeching)

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:42.123
  (anxious electronic tones)

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:50.798
(light chiming Christmas music)

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:02.009
        - My father said
        you don't exist.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.928
         - Ho ho ho ho,

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.846
    well perhaps your father
    doesn't know everything.

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:11.185
 Now, you need to keep your
 eye on the road, young man.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.320
  What is all the rush, for?

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:14.355
        - Sorry, Santa.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:18.225
     - Now, have you been
     a good boy this year?

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:22.129
 Because looking at your eyes,
 you seem to be trippin' balls.

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:26.067
     Well, that's okay,
     I'm glad you're here

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:28.002
        because I have a
        present for you.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.874
  The present is the future.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:34.942
        Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.778
        Merry Christmas.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.779
        Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:49.090
     (electronic beeping)

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:54.862
 - I'll get you outta there.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.365
          I promise.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:18:59.734
     - To the impossible.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.107
      - [Frazer] Siren.

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.918
     What are you doing?

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:20.755
     - That's not my name.

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.494
     - Don't say something
     we both know is a lie.

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.298
      - I won't hurt my
      friends for you.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.299
          - Friends?

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:35.770
     Where were they when
     you needed them?

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:37.204
    When you were so alone?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.307
         I was there.

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:44.078
  I was there for you, Siren

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.278
    and you promised to help
    me to save my brother.

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:48.065
 - Your brother died, it sucks

01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:49.949
     but killing people
     won't bring him back.

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.453
    - I didn't kill anyone.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:56.190
      They believed in
      what I was doing.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.893
     I thought you did too.

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:04.799
             Hey.

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:06.066
             Whoa.

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:07.067
             Hey.

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:10.971
             Hey.

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.072
 Do you remember what you
 were like when we first met?

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:17.011
     You hated yourself,
     you were pathetic.

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:22.149
 Look at you now, I made you
 whole, I saved you, Siren.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:24.802
      - My name is Gwen,

01:20:24.803 --> 01:20:27.020
  it's short for Gwendoline
  and I want you to leave.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.865
        (Gwen groaning)

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.172
         (screaming)

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.240
     - It's okay, Siren.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:50.978
  This will fix everything.

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:56.250
  (anxious electronic music)

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:58.586
          (snarling)

01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:19.440
            - Hello,

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:20.441
            brother.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.483
     - You're not Bobby.

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:30.551
         - But I am,

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:32.887
         your brother!

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.127
        (raspy gasping)

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.041
             Maya.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:56.277
             Yes.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:05.352
            - Maya.

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:08.155
     You didn't abandon me.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.292
      - You did some
      really bad things.

01:22:12.528 --> 01:22:15.195
    - [Frazer] Everything's
    still messed up.

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:18.332
     - [Maya] We'll find
     a way to fix it.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.269
      - It has to be me.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:30.711
      One last sacrifice
      to send us home.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.191
          (screams)

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:47.494
     (tense warbling tones)

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:04.211
     If I can save him,
     I can save everyone.

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:08.248
     I refuse to be alone.

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.452
     (anxious rock tones)

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:36.110
    - Spencer, we gotta get
    you to the hospital.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:37.678
         - I'm okay.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.081
     I know it doesn't look
     like it but I'm okay.

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:47.154
  - [Katrina] What happened?

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:48.522
        - I don't know,

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:51.258
         but I can see.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:54.261
     I can see everything.

01:23:56.232 --> 01:23:59.700
    (relaxed ensemble music)

01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.593
- I really want to be a writer.

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.597
    Do you have any advice?

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:37.704
- Don't ever let anyone say
your story isn't worth telling.

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:39.740
     You have a voice that
     needs to be heard.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:41.842
  Let us hear it, good luck.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:42.843
             Hi.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:44.711
    - [Katrina] You did it.

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:45.879
         You did it.
         - Oh my god.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.046
  - [Katrina] Look at this.

01:24:47.047 --> 01:24:48.213
  - No, I'm not gonna look.

01:24:48.214 --> 01:24:49.380
     - It's great.
     - Hey, how are you?

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:51.685
        - Thank you.
        - There you go.

01:24:51.687 --> 01:24:53.487
    - Thank you, thank you.

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:55.389
  - Paying customer up next.

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:58.492
  - Mom, I told you I'd give
  you the book for free.

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:00.360
 - We're so proud of you, Gwen.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.863
         - Thank you.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.397
 - I don't usually read sci-fi

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:09.436
 but I am very excited about
 reading your book, Gwendoline.

01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:11.438
          One for me

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:14.475
 and one for the university.

01:25:14.477 --> 01:25:17.778
     (relaxed guitar music)

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:24.051
 - [Spencer] Good to see you.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.419
    - You remember Spencer.
    - Yes.

01:25:26.422 --> 01:25:28.155
 Thank you, it's getting close.

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:31.391
      - Come in.
      - I would love to.

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:33.127
      - Watch your step.

01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:44.338
    - [Spencer] I was really
    unfair to you before.

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:47.407
      I thought I had it
      all figured out.

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:48.675
    - You've changed a lot.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.612
 We all have, for the better.

01:25:57.386 --> 01:26:00.854
  - [Spencer] There's still
  one thing left to do.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.523
      - [Katrina] What?

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:06.293
 - [Spencer] The impossible.

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:09.763
    (relaxed ensemble music)

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:21.308
     (electronic beeping)

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:46.600
     (mid tempo drumbeat)

01:26:47.937 --> 01:26:51.605
    (relaxed ensemble music)

01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:51.732
      (relaxed ensemble
      electronic music)
