00:10.340 --> 00:10.590
It's ironic.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.010
Of all the crap
I've done over the years-

00:13.680 --> 00:16.470
I'm gonna be sent to prison for
a crime I didn't even commit.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.470
Jake. We did what we could,
with what we had.

00:18.510 --> 00:19.720
And all we had to do,

00:19.770 --> 00:20.100
was plant
the seed of doubt-

00:21.350 --> 00:23.270
that you didn't kill former
mayor Clarke.

00:31.900 --> 00:32.950
Trust me.

00:32.990 --> 00:35.070
I got a good feeling about this.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.160
I got an awful feeling
about this.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.330
Walter's okay and all.

00:40.370 --> 00:40.580
But is he the best?

00:42.160 --> 00:45.370
They say a man who defends
himself has a fool as a client.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.830
What about the best
friend of the fool?

00:46.880 --> 00:47.920

What is your ex-girlfriend doing
with Judge Tizzard?

00:52.170 --> 00:54.090
[Mal] They were married,
believe it or not.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.640
A bar owner and a judge?

00:56.680 --> 01:00.560
Interesting combo. I wonder
if they're on good terms.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.180
I could punch you right
in the nose.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.060
I'm thinking no to that
good terms thing.

01:05.480 --> 01:05.810
Yeah.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.020
[Rose] You really
missed out on that-

01:08.060 --> 01:10.400
Malachy. She's a real winner.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.280
I can't imagine life
without Jake.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.950

This is not the time or place to
be talking about this.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.750
I know. But we haven't
barely talked at all.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.420
I love you.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.380
I need to get some air-

01:32.420 --> 01:32.630
For my lungs

01:34.090 --> 01:35.590

be punctured by a broken heart.

01:39.050 --> 01:40.310

01:52.280 --> 01:55.610

System, you know.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.350
And yes, we did smoke a little.

First of all-

We'll be in touch.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.240

I take it that's why you guys
were arguing earlier.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.870
Yes. She denied
sending that photo.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.130
But I'm telling you -
She was hiding something.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.420
Why would she blackmail you?

05:00.460 --> 05:01.920
She got nothing
from the divorce.

Malachy, you know
what she's capable of.

05:03.550 --> 05:03.840
[Mal]
That was a long time ago.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.510
And given this photo, I'm
inclined to take her side.

05:07.550 --> 05:07.850

How do I put this?

05:09.180 --> 05:11.010
Is the girl in the

05:11.060 --> 05:13.270

variety, maybe?

05:13.310 --> 05:13.600
I didn't pay her.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.560
And no, I don't know
anything about her.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.520
All I have is this.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.780
She took it out of her purse to
make a filter for the joint.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.110

05:25.490 --> 05:25.700

let me get this straight.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.320
You want me to spend my last two
days of freedom working for you.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.660
Are you stoned right now? Or-

05:33.080 --> 05:34.910
I know that you need the cash.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.250
Please do this for me.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.580
If this photo goes public,
I'll be fired.

05:40.210 --> 05:42.710
[Mal] You can't work a case with
your last two days of freedom.

05:42.760 --> 05:42.960
Leave it to me.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.380
You just wants to be alone with
Miranda Cahill

05:45.420 --> 05:45.720
so you can shag her again.

05:46.970 --> 05:49.140
Don't lie. Be careful.
Rose will find out.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.550
Maybe. 'Cause I'll tell her.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.640
Serious.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.470
Come on, Dad.

to spend a little time together.

05:59.190 --> 05:59.440
Who knows?
If we help Tizzard-

06:00.570 --> 06:02.070
He just might go light
on the sentence.

06:02.110 --> 06:03.940

I let you down.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.150
-Knock it off.
-This isn't over.

06:07.200 --> 06:07.450
We'll appeal.

06:08.910 --> 06:09.200
In order to do that, we
need a little thing called-

06:10.620 --> 06:12.540
Evidence. And unfortunately
we're in short supply.

06:25.630 --> 06:26.670
She's seeing red.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.630
Now, now.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
Don't be at it.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.680

misunderstanding.

You look good too.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.480
He does look good, doesn't he?

06:43.190 --> 06:44.900
Shouldn't you be in prison,
or something?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.360
Yeah, I saw you at my trial.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.700
Checking up on me?

06:48.740 --> 06:49.780
I didn't know that you cared.

06:49.820 --> 06:50.110
I don't.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.200
Tizzard had me removed
from the courthouse.

06:52.240 --> 06:52.490
I'm just waiting here

06:53.700 --> 06:54.910
to give him a big smack up
the side of that

06:54.950 --> 06:55.620

06:56.750 --> 06:58.210

buddy, there?

06:58.250 --> 07:00.000
None of your business.
That's what.

07:00.040 --> 07:00.250
[Mal] Judge Tizzard is
being blackmailed.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.840
And he seems to see you might
have something to do with that.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.670
As I said to him Judge Dimwit-

07:05.710 --> 07:06.010
I don't have anything to do

07:07.210 --> 07:07.510
with whatever it is
he's involved with.

07:09.130 --> 07:11.470
I didn't care that much about
him when I was married to him.

07:11.510 --> 07:14.010
And I care even less now.

07:14.050 --> 07:16.060
Always a pleasure to
see you, though, Mal.

07:24.110 --> 07:24.980
[Mal]
Who's the guy?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.650
Name says:
Lars McGill.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.280
You feel that?

07:30.320 --> 07:33.070
You two. You still got some
chemistry. I gotta say.

07:38.120 --> 07:43.120
Oh. I jumped the gun on that.
I'm a little bit sorry.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.750
[Jake] I appreciate that. But if
we could talk about anything

07:45.790 --> 07:47.210
other than my case
right now-

07:47.250 --> 07:48.760
It would be much appreciated.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.010
Thank you.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.180
I loves you.

07:52.550 --> 07:55.390
That was extremely awkward.
But thank you, Des.

07:55.430 --> 07:56.600
Now.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.810
Usually in a
blackmail case-

07:58.850 --> 08:00.100
there's a list of demands,
right?

08:01.770 --> 08:04.350
Whoever sent Judge Tizzard that
photo said they'd be in touch

08:04.400 --> 08:05.730
with what they want. Soon.

08:05.770 --> 08:06.940
[Rose]
Miranda Cahill, huh?

08:08.610 --> 08:10.110
She denies any involvement.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.110
Does she?

08:12.530 --> 08:14.320
Any word on who the Missus

08:14.360 --> 08:15.990
Tizzard was smoking
cabbage with?

08:16.030 --> 08:17.870
[Des] I did a search on the
matchbook cover.

08:17.910 --> 08:20.250
And it's for "Forever Discrete."

08:20.290 --> 08:20.580
It's an escort service.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.000
And the woman's name
is Vanessa Sandow.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.750
She's an escort?

08:24.790 --> 08:26.540
[Jake] So this was no
random meeting

08:26.590 --> 08:27.590
between Tizzard
and Vanessa.

08:28.210 --> 08:28.500
It was a setup.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.130
- Straight from the start.
- [Rose] Either way.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.680
Miranda could still
be behind it.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.760
You're right.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.100
But who is this McGill fella-

08:37.140 --> 08:38.600
Miranda was taking to at
the courthouse?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.520
- He got to her.
- It's Lars McGill.

08:40.560 --> 08:40.810
He's a lawyer.

08:41.980 --> 08:42.980
But apparently he only
has one client.

08:43.020 --> 08:43.230
Some numbered company-

08:44.900 --> 08:46.980
That owns a lot of real estate.
Including the Green Room Bar.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.270
Vic Saul's old bar.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.110
A bit of a coincidence.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.110
Saul must have sold it
after he went to jail.

08:52.150 --> 08:52.450
But who bought it?

08:53.450 --> 08:53.740
[Jake] We gotta find out.
And Des-

08:54.950 --> 08:56.240
Figure out who this missus,
Vanessa is.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.330
And who paid her to
set up Tizzard.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.330
Hi.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.460
Meet you outside.

stops on this one, Jake.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.060

I know it.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.680

everything's above board.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.560
I can't have you risking
everything for me again.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.360
Okay. But we will talk
later, right?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.900
You have my word on that.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.320
I gotta go.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.030

station right now.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.120
Inspector, what's going on?

09:41.160 --> 09:42.080
Just do it.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.040
[Pickard] Internal Affairs
is wrapping up

09:48.080 --> 09:49.580
their investigation
into you.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.670
Good. 'Cause as I said, I have
nothing to hide.

09:51.710 --> 09:53.170
See, that's where I
beg to differ.

09:53.210 --> 09:53.420
They've almost
finalized their report.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.550
And, let me tell you- They've
had a lot to work with.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.470
My record on this
Force is solid.

09:59.510 --> 09:59.720
Was solid.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.680
You were warned time
and time again-

10:02.720 --> 10:04.470
about the conflict of
interest you had

10:04.520 --> 10:06.270
with Jake and the
entire Doyle clan.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.730
And yet you continued to
ignore your superiors.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.810
And breach protocol-

10:09.860 --> 10:11.020
At every turn.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.570
I did no such thing.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.860
You'll have an opportunity to
defend yourself-

10:14.900 --> 10:16.570
When you meet with Internal
Affairs today.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.990
I'll be chairing the meeting.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.570
I suggest you think
long and hard

10:19.610 --> 10:20.950
as to what you're gonna say.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.530
I'd apologize profusely.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.410
Say Jake coerced you.

10:24.450 --> 10:27.330
And then, I'd beg for leniency.

10:27.370 --> 10:28.580
At that juncture-

10:28.620 --> 10:30.540
I might be able to help you.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.960
[Jake] Saul's old bar.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.970
Who do you think owns it now?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.890
Are you sleeping with
your eyes open again?

10:42.930 --> 10:44.430
We missed something.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.930
You're convicted for a crime you
didn't commit.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.480
How could we not fix this?

10:50.520 --> 10:53.110
To be honest, Dad, I'm
not sure that we can.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.610
Brogan, the guy who actually
killed Clarke, is dead.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.150
We have no substantive evidence.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.450
I was caught standing there,
over the body-

11:01.490 --> 11:03.620
With the murder
weapon in my hand.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.950
I mean, I got myself into this.

11:07.410 --> 11:09.960
Son, you get yourself into some
terrible situations.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.250
I mean, just awful.

11:14.290 --> 11:15.710
But ninety five percent
of the time-

11:15.750 --> 11:18.220
It's because you're trying
to help someone.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.130
You're a good man.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.090
And a great son.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.810
And I love you.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.230
Shall we kiss now, or-?

11:30.640 --> 11:31.940
Shut up.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.770
Miranda.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.070
What's she doing here?

11:38.190 --> 11:39.320
Let's go find out.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.110
[click]

11:42.160 --> 11:43.070
[click]

11:43.120 --> 11:44.370
What's she waiting for?

11:44.410 --> 11:45.990
She's an escort. Do the math.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.200
Rose, there's no way she's
waiting to do math.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.080
Unless that's a client's fetish
or something.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.000
I'll just-
Forget I said that.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.920
We need to figure out who
paid Vanessa-

11:55.960 --> 11:57.960
to pose with Tizzard.

11:58.010 --> 12:01.180
[clicking]

12:01.220 --> 12:02.130
This is hot.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.550
[Rose laughs]

12:04.890 --> 12:08.140
I meant, like, her -
the shade of her lipstick.

12:08.180 --> 12:09.640
I think she's an autumn.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.230
It's okay. I won't tell Tinny.

12:13.270 --> 12:15.820
I don't think Tinny would care.
You can tell away.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.740
This is a bit of a confusing
time for all of us.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.160
Yes b'y.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.280
[clicking]

12:27.330 --> 12:28.540
I know that guy from somewhere.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.250
We're not the only ones
taking pictures.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.710
-[Rose] Who is it?
-It's Finn.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.250
-[Rose] Oh Finn.
-[Finn] All right.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.050
Well, well, well.

12:42.090 --> 12:43.010
What do you know?

12:43.050 --> 12:44.090
Can I help you?

12:45.180 --> 12:47.600
Aren't you some kind
of fugitive?

12:47.640 --> 12:47.890
I guess this is you-

12:49.140 --> 12:50.850
- hiding in plain sight.
- Turned myself in.

12:50.890 --> 12:51.270
Had a great lawyer.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.060
At the end of the day,
they wanted Saul.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.150
This is my bar now.

12:55.190 --> 12:55.520
Miranda?

12:56.770 --> 12:58.190
- What are you doing here?
- Herself and her

12:58.230 --> 12:59.820
arse lawyer over there-

12:59.860 --> 13:02.440
Are trying to pressure me
into selling my bar.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.110
Just trying to do some business.

13:04.150 --> 13:04.450
All on the up and up.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.450
Your broke out all the windows
in the back of my bar.

13:07.490 --> 13:09.280
You smashed up my car
and you're guy-

13:09.330 --> 13:11.790
came over this morning
threatening even worse.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.210
You need to go to the cops.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.160
[Alisha]
Do it.

13:14.210 --> 13:14.460
It's all hearsay anyway.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.750
What do you want
with Miranda's bar?

13:16.790 --> 13:17.000
Just expanding my interests.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.840
And if you want to help
your friend- Tell her to sell.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.590
I would burn that bar
to the ground.

13:21.630 --> 13:24.630
Instead of ever selling to
the likes of you.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.930
Suit yourself.

13:27.550 --> 13:28.930
I will.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.850
I see you're making new friends
with the Chevaliers now.

13:34.890 --> 13:37.270
Is this how you spend your last
forty eight hours of freedom?

13:37.310 --> 13:39.400
You're a strange man.

13:40.610 --> 13:42.030
We'll show ourselves out.

13:42.690 --> 13:43.570
See ya.

13:44.650 --> 13:45.530
B'ys.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.910
[Pickard] We've reviewed the
report together.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.450
Is there anything
you'd like to add

13:51.490 --> 13:53.200
before we make a decision
on this case?

13:54.540 --> 13:56.500
I'd like to say that I'm-

13:57.500 --> 14:01.090
I'm sorry-

14:02.500 --> 14:04.970
It's okay. Take your time.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.260
You know what? No.
No I'm not sorry.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.430
Because I've done nothing wrong.

14:10.470 --> 14:11.970
Despite what that report says.

14:12.010 --> 14:13.100
Bennett, I'd stop right there.

14:13.140 --> 14:15.430
No. Jake Doyle is innocent.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.810
I followed my intuition.
And tried to prove it.

14:17.850 --> 14:18.150
I did my job.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.110
The only apology I owe is to
Jake Doyle and his family-

14:22.150 --> 14:23.860
For not finding the
evidence he needed.

14:23.900 --> 14:24.110
Thank you, Sergeant Bennet.

14:25.570 --> 14:27.700
We will notify you as to a final
decision on this matter.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.960
Oh. Rose.
Sorry.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.290
I'd love to chat. But, you know,
the early worm and all that.

14:41.330 --> 14:44.090
- Hello Finn.
- Oh. Young Courtney.

14:44.130 --> 14:48.420
Why were you taking pictures of
Vanessa with that man in a suit?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.760
You look like a dirty old
man there, Finnster.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.930
Me and Vanessa works
for an Escort service.

14:53.970 --> 14:55.890
Oh wow. Do you get to wear
a dress and all that?

14:55.930 --> 14:57.930
No, I just picks up the
cash, smart ass.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.060
Anyway, this guy asked
me to take photos

15:00.100 --> 15:01.150
of one of the escorts-

15:01.190 --> 15:02.480
with Judge Tizzard.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.980
And then this guy, Plaskett.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.110
Thomas Plaskett.
I knew I knew him.

15:06.150 --> 15:06.400
- Who is he?
- He's a city planner.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.990
We had dealings with him when we
were doing work on the Duke.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.450
Anyway, Plaskett has
business at the Courthouse.

15:11.490 --> 15:12.660
So I followed his from there.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.080
And who paid you to do this?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.740
I dunno. It was all done
over the phone.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.200
No meetings. All cash.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.580
Hey! Speaking of cash.

15:18.620 --> 15:19.420
You owe me.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.670
That money is long gone, man.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.840
The economy, and all, you know.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.090
Anyone else find it odd that
Alisha managed to beat

15:29.130 --> 15:29.470
all of her charges?

15:30.680 --> 15:31.760
Her federal file is
locked up so tight,

15:31.800 --> 15:32.890
I couldn't get any details.

15:32.930 --> 15:34.390
Maybe she did a plea bargain

15:34.430 --> 15:35.890
in exchange for testimony
against Saul.

15:35.930 --> 15:36.100
I don't know.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.230
But she seemed pretty cozy with
all those Chevaliers there.

15:39.270 --> 15:40.560
That's a scary alliance.

15:40.600 --> 15:40.940
Well, someone paid Finn-

15:42.230 --> 15:44.810
Anonymously. To get pictures
of Judge Tizzard-

15:44.860 --> 15:46.440
And Thomas Plaskett,
city planner.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.440
[Jake] There's a
connection there.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.740
You stay on Finn.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.110
[phone rings]

15:54.450 --> 15:56.200
Well, well, well. To what do
I owe this pleasure?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.490
[Alisha] You really should
convince your friend

15:57.540 --> 15:57.790
Miranda to sell.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.660
-Sooner rather than later. -That sounds like a threat-

16:00.710 --> 16:01.750
If I ever heard one.

16:01.790 --> 16:02.870
No one has to get hurt.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.590
Tell her to sell.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.050
Huh.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.420
We gotta go see your
ex-girlfriend.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.050
Old Miranda.

16:15.850 --> 16:16.100
Miranda's pretty stubborn.

16:17.180 --> 16:17.510
She won't listen to
anything we say.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.020
She's gotta know what
she's up against.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.890
Alisha's working with
the bikers.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.230
She's gonna do whatever it takes

16:23.270 --> 16:24.980
to get Miranda to do
what she wants.

16:26.310 --> 16:27.400
[Mal]
Mayor Budgell?

16:27.440 --> 16:27.780
Well, well, look who it is.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.820
The man who killed my
predecessor, William Clarke.

16:30.860 --> 16:31.900
It's-

16:31.950 --> 16:33.200
Jack Doyle, right.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.820
It's Jake.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.530
Sorry. You're not gonna
kill me over that, are ya?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.700
You're the father.
So you're the P.I's.

16:39.750 --> 16:40.000
Mr. Mayor.

16:41.370 --> 16:42.710
You know, Jack - None of us like
the harbor fence.

16:42.750 --> 16:43.040
But really, murder?

16:44.620 --> 16:44.920
You couldn't just call in the
Open Line show and complain.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.630
- Like everyone else?
- My name is Jake.

16:47.670 --> 16:47.960
You know what I wonder?

16:49.300 --> 16:49.510
I wonder who's gonna protect
the city from the-

16:50.760 --> 16:51.050
double parked cars
and the spray painters-

16:52.670 --> 16:54.340
that are terrorizing the place
once you're in the Big House.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.510
God help us, eh?

16:55.550 --> 16:56.720
That's a good one.

16:57.930 --> 16:58.180
Listen, Jack-

16:59.310 --> 17:00.810
You know, William Clarke
was a sleveen.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.730
Whether he deserves to
be dead, I don't know.

17:02.770 --> 17:03.850
But if you killed him-

17:03.890 --> 17:06.190
We're all better off. In fact-

17:06.230 --> 17:07.900
We're better off with Budgell.

17:09.230 --> 17:10.190
He's a good mayor.

17:10.230 --> 17:10.530
He's a tool.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.070
Let's just go talk to your
ex-girlfriend.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.160
For once, I'm happy it's your
ex- girlfriend, and not mine.

17:15.200 --> 17:15.450
Don't start.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.740
Dad. We gotta talk to her before
something bad happens.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.580
[explosion]

17:24.250 --> 17:24.870
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.790
Call the ambulances.
Call the Fire Department.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.960
Call everybody. I'm going in.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.340
Be careful.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.300
[explosion]

17:34.340 --> 17:35.220
Jake!

17:38.180 --> 17:39.350
I got her!

17:41.970 --> 17:44.140
You'll be okay.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.850
Thank you Mal, honey.
You save my life.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.440
Thank you Mal? What?

17:49.520 --> 17:50.940
[Leslie] We're talking to her now.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.360
But Alisha's got an alibi.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.990
She was nowhere near
Miranda's bar.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.650
That doesn't mean she didn't
order the bombing.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.700
Alisha was threatening Miranda.

17:57.740 --> 17:58.870
She even called Jake
before it blew

17:58.910 --> 18:00.200
with a last warning to sell.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.580
That wouldn't make any sense.

18:01.620 --> 18:01.790
Why would she call me

18:03.120 --> 18:04.790
if she was planning to blow the
place up anyway?

18:04.830 --> 18:06.120
Maybe she's playing you.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.170
Maybe.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.750
What are you doing?

18:13.090 --> 18:14.010
You're letting Alisha go?

18:14.050 --> 18:14.300
That's right.

18:15.380 --> 18:15.550
We have your statement,
Mr. Doyle.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.130
So you and your son are
also free to go.

18:18.180 --> 18:18.390
[Jake]
You should maybe-

18:20.050 --> 18:21.850
keep her around here for a bit
until we figure this thing out.

18:21.890 --> 18:22.140
We?

18:23.220 --> 18:24.890
You're already going
to prison, Jake.

18:24.930 --> 18:25.230
Keep this up.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.690
The old man
will be joining you.

18:28.310 --> 18:29.190
Got it?

18:30.730 --> 18:31.690
This is unbelievable.

18:31.730 --> 18:33.360
Just give me a second.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.740
What game are you
playing at here?

18:35.780 --> 18:36.570
Is Miranda okay?

18:37.700 --> 18:38.860
You know, if I didn't
know any better,

18:38.910 --> 18:40.620
I'd say that you actually cared.

18:40.660 --> 18:41.830
She'll live.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.080
Did you do this?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.750
There are things going on that
you're unaware of.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.040
You have enough problems
of your own to deal with.

18:55.590 --> 18:55.840
The Chevaliers.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.340
There was a load of
them at the bar.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.880
Do you think they're
connected to this?

18:59.930 --> 19:00.260
[Leslie]
Don't know.

19:01.640 --> 19:01.890
But they've been very
active in the city lately.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.810
[Mal] Be great to get some intel
from the inside on that front.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.770
I know just the rat to talk to.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.910
Some cocky on that side of
the table, aren't ya?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.370
But won't be long now.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.490
A stay of execution,
no thanks to you.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.160
Oh, is that what this is?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.540
You're still rotted about
me taking out Brogan?

19:29.580 --> 19:31.790
Him being the link to
your freedom-

19:31.830 --> 19:33.380
That was just a bonus.

19:35.130 --> 19:35.380
See, you know what I think?

19:36.760 --> 19:39.720
The top brass of the Chevaliers
ordered that hit.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.090
I'm willing to bet your freedom-

19:41.590 --> 19:44.430
That they didn't even tell you
why they wanted him dead.

19:44.470 --> 19:46.600
You know what, man?

19:46.640 --> 19:48.680
Killing Brogan

19:48.720 --> 19:51.270
put me right at the top
of the food chain in here.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.440
At least the Bikers trusted him
with information.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.940
I knows lots. Don't
you worry about that.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.320
Oh, you know lots?

19:58.530 --> 19:58.820
Like what?

20:00.280 --> 20:03.450
Brogan, Vic Saul- They all
started out on their own.

20:03.490 --> 20:05.950
But they got swallowed
up by the Chevaliers.

20:05.990 --> 20:08.000
Everyone works for the Bikers.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.830
Everyone.

20:09.870 --> 20:10.910
Even Alisha?

20:12.210 --> 20:15.210
Someone go the hots for
little Alisha, do they?

20:15.250 --> 20:16.670
See. I know it.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.050
They didn't trust you with shit.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.130
Everything you just told
me I already knew.

20:21.170 --> 20:26.220
Yeah? Well, she's been with the
Chevaliers the whole while.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.640
Right from Day One.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.350
Dicky Bird.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.600
Is that right?

20:32.640 --> 20:35.560
You're telling me I
don't know nudding?

20:35.610 --> 20:37.610
She took out Vic Saul for us.

20:37.650 --> 20:38.980
And you know something?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.990
Now that Damon Rhodes
owns this town,

20:41.860 --> 20:43.570
things are starting to look

20:43.610 --> 20:46.620
a lot better for Yours Truly.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.290
Damon Rhodes?

20:51.120 --> 20:51.460
You know what, Jake?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.830
I don't even care that I just
told you a bunch of stuff

20:54.870 --> 20:56.290
that I shouldn't be telling you.

20:56.330 --> 20:56.590
Because the truth is-

20:57.840 --> 21:00.500
Before not too long, you'll
be back in here.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.380
And you'll be
scrubbing the floors,

21:02.420 --> 21:04.880
cleaning the toilets
when I tells you to.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.220
So my advice?

21:06.260 --> 21:07.890
Start preparing-

21:07.930 --> 21:10.310
to be my bitch.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.610
You need to lay low for a while.

21:22.650 --> 21:23.570
Go into hiding?

21:23.610 --> 21:23.860
I'm Miranda Cahill.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.530
I've never run away from
anything in my whole life.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.790
[coughing]

21:31.790 --> 21:33.120
Okay, I'll get her some water.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.750
She's a wonderful woman, Mal.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.540
[Mal] Believe me.
I'm the lucky one.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.750
You saved my life.

21:40.790 --> 21:44.300
Well, technically, Jake was the
one who saved your life.

21:44.340 --> 21:46.970
You've always been there for me.

21:47.010 --> 21:49.510
I don't know why
I ever let you go.

21:49.550 --> 21:52.560
Technically, I
broke up with you.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.520
Oh Mal.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.690
[Mal] [muffled]
Miranda! Okay!

21:57.730 --> 21:59.150
Ahem.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.730
Am I interrupting something?

22:12.700 --> 22:12.990
Lars McGill.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.160
Alisha's lawyer.
Blackmail photos.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.040
That's just rotten, Finn.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.590
You again.

22:23.630 --> 22:25.630
McGill was your client.
You lied to us.

22:25.670 --> 22:28.130
Truth is in the eye of
the beholder.

22:28.180 --> 22:28.390
If you lied about that,

22:29.720 --> 22:30.680
then you lied about not
having money to pay me

22:30.720 --> 22:32.260
for the work I did for you.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.680
I am broke.

22:35.350 --> 22:36.890
If you don't pay me my money,

22:36.930 --> 22:37.940
I 'm gonna tell McGill.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.060
I'm gonna tell the Bikers.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.100
I'm gonna tell everyone-

22:40.150 --> 22:41.360
You're working the cops.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.360
You wouldn't do that.

22:43.320 --> 22:43.650
My best friend's
going to prison.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.030
My girlfriend doesn't
talk to me.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.530
And I live in a supply
closet above a bar.

22:47.570 --> 22:48.360
What do you think?

22:48.400 --> 22:48.700
Here. Look.

22:49.990 --> 22:51.370
That's all I got left from
the old pawn shop.

22:51.410 --> 22:52.530
- That's it.
- Oh yeah?

22:52.580 --> 22:53.830
Okay. Let's see.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.370
- Costume.
- Good stuff.

22:55.410 --> 22:55.700
What's that?

22:56.870 --> 22:58.290
That's good stuff, man!
That's good stuff.

22:58.330 --> 22:59.920
Oh yeah? That's real.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.670
No, that's not supposed
to be in there.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.340
That cost me more than
everything I own!

23:03.380 --> 23:04.460
Interest. Now get.

23:05.130 --> 23:06.010
Get!

23:10.130 --> 23:13.100
This job's changing me.
And I likes it.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.140
- Here you go.
- Thanks very much.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.360
This bar, you know.
I've always liked it.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.230
It's a great spot to
get loaded in.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.900
It's just the old management

23:27.940 --> 23:29.740
that I had a
serious problem with.

23:29.780 --> 23:30.110
What do you want?

23:31.450 --> 23:32.620
You've been working
with the Chevalier Bikers-

23:32.660 --> 23:33.620
This entire time.

23:33.660 --> 23:35.200
I'm asking you nicely-

23:35.240 --> 23:38.950
to leave me alone.
And stay out of it.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.370
What I can't figure out is- why
you're blackmailing Tizzard.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.710
Why is that?

23:42.750 --> 23:47.250
I gotta say.
If I was looking at

23:47.300 --> 23:49.550
a lifetime in prison with only
two days of freedom left-

23:49.590 --> 23:50.840
Who's this Dicksmack?

23:50.880 --> 23:51.180
Sticking my face in a bunch of

23:52.220 --> 23:52.510
business where
it doesn't belong.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.510
Not how I'd like to
spend my time.

23:55.550 --> 23:57.560
Something wrong with
him, I think.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.480
In the head.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Damon Rhodes.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.310
You're Damon Rhodes?

24:03.350 --> 24:04.360
Of course.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.860
And you. I remember you.

24:05.900 --> 24:09.110
I busted him years back for,
what was it?

24:09.150 --> 24:10.900
Dealing Oxy.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.780
We've been watching you
for a while.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.320
[laughing] You think you meant
for that to come across

24:15.370 --> 24:15.870
as creepy as it sounded?

24:16.990 --> 24:19.040
-You've been busy.
-So have you two.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.750
What were you doing in my trial-
Exactly?

24:20.790 --> 24:22.460
Special interest in law
and order.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.420
They're the fellas who blew
up Miranda's bar.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.930
This is solid TV, if you ask me.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.470
The production value
isn't great.

24:36.510 --> 24:36.760
But we'll live.

24:38.390 --> 24:40.850
[Rhodes] I'm guessing you want
your freedom more than anything.

24:42.020 --> 24:43.690
[Rodney] We got this
from Brogan's guy.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.690
What are you doing?

24:50.490 --> 24:51.950
Making Jake an offer.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.660
What kind of offer?

24:54.700 --> 24:57.200
What you did in your short time
in prison is impressive.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.410
Exposing two different drug
distribution systems

24:59.450 --> 25:01.500
while dealing with Brogan
and the rival gangs

25:01.540 --> 25:03.790
who all wanted you dead.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.540
It's always nice to meet a fan.
But-

25:06.330 --> 25:07.670
What do you want?

25:07.710 --> 25:10.130
Put your skills to work for me.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.760
On the inside for three years.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
At which time-

25:13.840 --> 25:16.390
I will give you that footage.
And you will be a free man.

25:16.430 --> 25:17.680
Are you out of your mind?

25:17.720 --> 25:17.970
And after you get out-

25:19.060 --> 25:20.850
I'll present you
with another offer.

25:20.890 --> 25:22.680
One that will make you
a very rich man.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.270
Allow me to counter-

25:24.310 --> 25:25.230
Oof!

25:25.270 --> 25:26.150
[bang]

25:29.360 --> 25:30.280
[crash]

25:31.570 --> 25:32.530
Nope.

25:32.570 --> 25:34.570
Just leave, Jake. Go.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.620
I want that video.

25:38.910 --> 25:40.910
It's time you start caring
about what I want.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.260
- [punch]
- Aggh!

25:55.880 --> 25:56.930
[Alisha]
Rhodes!

25:56.970 --> 25:58.180
Don't be stupid.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.100
Just a nick.

26:01.060 --> 26:01.390
If you don't take the offer-

26:02.720 --> 26:04.350
The next one will be much
deeper. I promise you.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.350
So take a couple of
hours to think about it.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.100
And it's yes or no.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.900
If it's no, you die.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.940
Just so you're clear about that.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.480
Take him out of here.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.360
You're gonna wish that
you just killed me.

26:22.830 --> 26:23.870
[Nikki]
This is bad.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.200
You know this isn't good enough.

26:25.250 --> 26:25.460
You need to go to an
actual hospital.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.580
Because the wound is deep. And
there's still some glass in it.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.790
So you need to go to a hospital.

26:29.830 --> 26:31.750
Yeah. If I go to a hospital-

26:31.790 --> 26:35.050
they're gonna make me file
a report with the cops.

26:35.090 --> 26:38.300
Which means I'll lose my last
few minutes of freedom. So-

26:38.890 --> 26:40.140
Forget about it.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.760
I can't believe
you're going away.

26:43.390 --> 26:44.560
Ah! Nik-

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
Nik!
Gut wound.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.430
Shit! Sorry.

26:47.890 --> 26:50.480
Look. This is putting you in
a tough spot. I get that.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.360
I know that you did
not kill Clarke.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.730
The man was scum.

26:53.770 --> 26:55.230
David prosecuted him on
fraud charges.

26:55.280 --> 26:55.570
So I know firsthand.

26:56.820 --> 26:58.400
I'm not gonna drag you
down with me. So go.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.530
Please.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.200
Gut wound.
Sorry.

27:05.370 --> 27:08.790
Just try to take care of
yourself. Okay?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.090
[Mal] Rhodes. The head of
the Chevaliers-

27:20.130 --> 27:22.340
has the video footage proving
your innocence.

27:22.390 --> 27:26.350
And it's yours after three years
if you work for him in prison.

27:26.390 --> 27:26.640
Which obviously I'm
never gonna do.

27:27.930 --> 27:29.940
Which is why we need to
focus all of our energy

27:29.980 --> 27:30.270
in getting hold of it.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.400
[Jake] The Chevaliers
are involved

27:32.440 --> 27:32.650
in everything in this town.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.730
They're blackmailing Tizzard.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.570
They blew up Miranda's bar.

27:36.610 --> 27:37.650
They got rid of Saul.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.030
They put Alisha in power.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.160
I mean, their leader - He
controls everything.

27:41.200 --> 27:41.490
What do we got on him anyway?

27:43.070 --> 27:45.660
[Des] Other than the fact that
he's the head of the largest

27:45.700 --> 27:48.500
and most dangerous Biker gang
in the whole country?

27:48.540 --> 27:51.710
And rumor has it, he got there
by knocking off the old guard.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.040
Our next move?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.670
I dunno.

27:54.710 --> 27:57.090
Maybe Walter and I should
talk to Tizzard.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.840
Explain to him that the Bikers
are behind this whole thing.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.510
And maybe we can go from there.

28:01.550 --> 28:02.840
I better check in on Miranda.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.680
No one's safe in this mess.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.010
Or-

28:06.060 --> 28:07.260
Rose. You could go.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.060
Na-ahh. We're going together.

28:09.100 --> 28:09.480
And if she touches you again-

28:10.770 --> 28:12.230
She's gonna wish the Bikers
got to her first.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.900
[message sound]

28:24.700 --> 28:25.990
[Tizzard] So I'm being
blackmailed

28:26.030 --> 28:27.280
by the Chevaliers-

28:27.330 --> 28:28.950
who are taking over the city.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.080
And they're leader,

28:31.120 --> 28:34.500
Damon Rhodes has video
proving your innocence?

28:34.540 --> 28:36.040
Have you seen this footage?

28:37.040 --> 28:37.340
Well, no.

28:38.590 --> 28:40.300
No, because this is a crazy
made up story.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.970
No, no. No. It's not. Okay-

28:43.010 --> 28:43.300
Listen to me.

28:44.510 --> 28:46.050
This is much bigger than me.
Okay, Judge-

28:46.100 --> 28:46.390
You gotta have the cops do a

28:47.600 --> 28:48.930
full blitz on the Chevaliers
and Rhodes.

28:48.970 --> 28:50.560
And it's gotta happen
right away.

28:53.730 --> 28:56.150
Is he acting weird? Why
are you acting so weird?

28:56.190 --> 28:58.860
I am not acting anything.

29:05.870 --> 29:06.740
What's in here?

29:10.990 --> 29:13.910
Jake Doyle gets life in prison
with no parole

29:13.960 --> 29:15.580
and sent to Mill Haven.

29:15.630 --> 29:15.920
Millhaven?

29:17.040 --> 29:17.250
That place is
chock full of Bikers.

29:18.710 --> 29:20.170
[Jake] That's where they wanted
me to work for them.

29:20.210 --> 29:21.630
This is why you're
being blackmailed.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.050
[Tizzard]
Jake. Listen.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.010
They came to my
house last night.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.590
And they threatened to kill me.

29:26.640 --> 29:26.890
So?

29:28.010 --> 29:29.680
Have them arrested.
You're a judge.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.010
And then what?

29:31.470 --> 29:34.850
I mean, they're just pawns.
There are a thousand more

29:34.890 --> 29:35.520
in Rhodes' army.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.060
Okay, well. You gotta
work with me.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.860
We'll take down Rhodes together.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.450
No. No. It cannot be done.

29:44.490 --> 29:46.070
I'm calling for a mistrial.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.570
You're clearly compromised here.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.530
No-

29:48.570 --> 29:49.870
That trial is over.

29:49.910 --> 29:51.910
The jury decided your case.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.830
It's your word against mine.

29:53.870 --> 29:56.210
I'm sorry there's not
some other way.

29:56.250 --> 29:56.580
But there is another way.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.750
And Jake, I'm gonna have to
revoke your bail.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.130
- Jake.
- Bailiff!

30:01.170 --> 30:02.460
-Run.
-Bailiff!

30:02.510 --> 30:03.420
Go now!

30:04.300 --> 30:05.220
Go!

30:07.840 --> 30:09.010
Run!

30:11.260 --> 30:12.220
Miranda?

30:12.260 --> 30:12.600
Where are you going?

30:14.140 --> 30:17.900
McGill and a couple of his Biker
pals paid me another visit.

30:17.940 --> 30:19.150
I can't beat 'em.

30:19.190 --> 30:19.480
It's over, Mal.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.270
I'm gonna sell them
whatever's left of my bar.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.900
You can't do that.

30:23.940 --> 30:24.240
I'm not the only one.

30:25.570 --> 30:27.740
Four or five bar owners on
George are selling.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.030
I guess they got the message

30:29.070 --> 30:30.820
when they saw my place in
flames.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.410
You see what they're doing?
They're setting up shop.

30:32.450 --> 30:32.700
It's a front-

30:34.080 --> 30:35.250
For drugs and racketeering
and God knows what else.

30:35.290 --> 30:35.620
[Mal]
You can't just give up.

30:36.750 --> 30:37.920
That's not the
Miranda Cahill I know.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.250
I've been in
this business

30:39.500 --> 30:40.960
for over thirty years.
I thought I'd seen-

30:41.000 --> 30:42.460
everything. But
those Chevaliers.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.670
They're here to stay.
This town is done.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.840
Anyway. Thanks
for everything, Mal.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.680
Ahem.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.560
Rose.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.430
Miranda.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.230
I can't help it if I'm
irresistible.

30:57.270 --> 30:58.390
Oh, please.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.600
[phone rings]

31:02.400 --> 31:04.230
-Son? -That didn't go very well.

31:04.270 --> 31:05.820
The Chevaliers got to Tizzard.

31:05.860 --> 31:08.320
And apparently, I'm a fugitive.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.570
Where are you? I'll meet you.

31:09.610 --> 31:10.740
No, it's too dangerous.

31:10.780 --> 31:11.910
I'll meet you.

31:11.950 --> 31:12.950
Text me a location.

31:14.620 --> 31:17.660
Alright. Fine, Dad. Thanks.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.420
Here's the ruling.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.630
I need you to review
it and sign it.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.260
Let's just dispense
with the dramatics.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.260
Tell me how many
ranks I'm dropping.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.430
Or how much paid leave
I need to take.

31:33.470 --> 31:34.510
You were warned.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.100
I'm afraid you're fired.

31:38.680 --> 31:38.940
Fired?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.440
The good news is, there won't be
any criminal charges laid.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.320
I'll give you the courtesy of
cleaning out your own desk.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.320
Inspector.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.610
Oh, by the way.

31:47.650 --> 31:47.900
I know this isn't a good time.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.950
But there's been a bench warrant
issued for your boyfriend,

31:50.990 --> 31:51.200
Jake Doyle.

31:52.070 --> 31:53.450
Do yourselves both a favor.

31:53.490 --> 31:54.950
Have him turn himself in.

31:54.990 --> 31:55.990
End this.

32:12.550 --> 32:13.430
Dad.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.180
-Dad, look out!
-Jake!

32:16.220 --> 32:17.350
Get outta here!

32:17.390 --> 32:18.220
[crack]

32:22.650 --> 32:24.480
Come on!

32:24.520 --> 32:26.570
[explosion]

32:28.780 --> 32:31.280
[coughing]

32:34.240 --> 32:35.780
There goes your truck.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.740
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.620
[phone rings]

32:41.910 --> 32:42.210
What?

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
[Rhodes] Talking to the
Judge. Not smart.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.040
Consider that a warning.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.920
And I need your answer
now on my offer.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.210
Yeah, well-

32:50.260 --> 32:51.260
There's no way I'm
working for you.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.680
Then I gotta take out you-

32:52.720 --> 32:54.010
And your whole family.

32:56.930 --> 32:59.020
Rhodes is coming for us all.

33:09.190 --> 33:09.440
Des, what's going on?

33:10.780 --> 33:12.190
Sign on the door says
closed for Bar Mitzvah.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.740
It was super slow. So,
I closed everything.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.530
I'm really glad that
you've reached out.

33:16.570 --> 33:20.080
And I know everything has
been so crazy lately.

33:21.040 --> 33:21.250
That's what I wanna talk about.

33:22.870 --> 33:25.210
I wanna say I'm sorry that I've
been so cold to you lately.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.250
It's okay, Tinny.

33:26.290 --> 33:27.380
No it's not.

33:27.420 --> 33:28.750
I really care about you, Des.

33:28.790 --> 33:29.840
Good.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.670
I'm happy to hear you say that.

33:31.710 --> 33:35.090
I'm not sure that this
is what I want.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.510
Even before all
this madness with Jake.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.100
I've been trying to sort
me and you out.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.190
So, sort it.

33:47.770 --> 33:49.020
You either love me-

33:50.650 --> 33:51.980
Or you don't.

33:53.570 --> 33:54.900
I do love you.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.570
I just don't feel like
it's enough.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.990
Enough for what?

34:04.830 --> 34:06.420
So what are you saying?

34:09.130 --> 34:10.960
Are you breaking up with me?

34:13.510 --> 34:14.840
Yeah.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.470
I think I am.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.180
I'm sorry.

34:29.310 --> 34:30.810
We have a biker gang after us?

34:30.860 --> 34:31.190
Yeah. I'm afraid so, dear.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.400
See, this is the reason that
Tinny should go away with me.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.030
And the fact that she's
done with Des,

34:36.070 --> 34:37.450
[door opening sound]

34:39.740 --> 34:41.080
There's somebody in this house.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.250
- Hey.
- Ahhh!

34:46.410 --> 34:47.290
Just us.

34:48.250 --> 34:48.460
Jake.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.670
I'm so sorry. I can't believe
you're going to prison.

34:51.710 --> 34:52.590
It's okay.

34:54.590 --> 34:54.840
Where's Des and Tinny?

34:56.050 --> 34:58.220
Tinny said she was
meeting Des at the Duke.

34:59.550 --> 35:00.510
That's not good.

35:01.550 --> 35:02.430
Let's go.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.140
Wait for us.

35:12.230 --> 35:13.400
Closed.

35:13.980 --> 35:15.070
Broken heart.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.240
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

35:19.740 --> 35:20.700
Damon Rhodes. What
are you doing here?

35:21.990 --> 35:24.370
I need you to deliver a
message to Jake for me.

35:24.910 --> 35:25.910
What's that?

35:27.410 --> 35:28.330
- [whack]
- Ugh!

35:28.370 --> 35:29.580
Ah!

35:33.130 --> 35:34.040
[punch]

35:34.090 --> 35:37.130
Aahh!

35:37.170 --> 35:38.050
Arrgh!

35:38.760 --> 35:39.630
[crash]

35:44.720 --> 35:45.810
[whack]

35:45.850 --> 35:46.720
[whack]

35:51.270 --> 35:51.400
Ahh.

35:52.940 --> 35:56.150
Yeah. I think Jake will get the
message loud and clear.

35:56.190 --> 35:57.240
[bang]

36:07.040 --> 36:08.120
[Jake]
Des!

36:09.620 --> 36:10.540
Des?

36:13.130 --> 36:14.500
- Is he-?
- He's alive.

36:14.540 --> 36:14.880
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.050
- Here, take that.
- Des, it's okay.

36:17.090 --> 36:17.960
It's okay.
We're here.

36:23.510 --> 36:24.800
Look what they did to him.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.010
Okay.

36:27.930 --> 36:29.220
Did your boss, Rhodes do this?

36:29.270 --> 36:31.060
Rhodes is not my boss anymore.

36:31.100 --> 36:31.390
Liar.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.440
I swear I don't know
anything about this.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.560
Rose.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.320
Just let her talk.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.030
I came to warn you guys.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.820
Rhodes is gonna kill
your family, Jake.

36:42.860 --> 36:44.700
He's coming for you. We
need to work together.

36:44.740 --> 36:45.700
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.580
[Rose]
Get outta here.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.540
Before I really lose my temper.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.580
I'd do what she says,
if I were you.

36:51.620 --> 36:52.580
Yeah, okay.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.580
The ambulance is on its way.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.250
Dad-

36:57.290 --> 36:59.210
Maybe I should do
whatever it is that he wants.

37:00.170 --> 37:00.420
Maybe then he'll
leave you alone.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.510
I raised you better than
that. So that's out.

37:03.550 --> 37:03.840
But we have to act. Now.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.550
I have a feeling the subtle
approach is not gonna work.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.140
Great. I know where
this is going.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.600
I'm not sure we have
any other choice.

37:12.310 --> 37:13.520
He's coming around.

37:15.190 --> 37:16.940
Hey.

37:16.980 --> 37:17.900
[Mal]
Des?

37:19.650 --> 37:21.650
We're gonna find the fellas
who did this to you.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.240
And they're gonna pay.
I swear to God-

37:23.280 --> 37:23.820
They're gonna pay.

37:24.950 --> 37:28.030
Jake, you can't put
yourself at risk.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.660
Shhh. Don't worry.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.040
Everything's gonna be fine.

37:32.620 --> 37:35.080
[Kathleen] Don't be stupid. You
can't go after these guys.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.330
Dad- we can't have
you going to jail too.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.210
No one's going to jail.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.460
Well, except Jake.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.180
It's loaded.

37:45.220 --> 37:46.680
Dad, this is crazy.

37:46.720 --> 37:47.050
Please.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.850
Honey, don't worry.
This is for show.

37:49.890 --> 37:51.310
We're just gonna get
their attention.

37:51.350 --> 37:52.430
-Then we talk.
-[Jake] Yeah.

37:52.470 --> 37:52.730
We'll take care of this.

37:53.850 --> 37:55.520
You guys just make sure
Des is okay.

38:06.530 --> 38:07.490
[bang]

38:11.330 --> 38:12.330
[bang]

38:12.370 --> 38:13.450
- [whack]
- Arggh!

38:13.500 --> 38:14.410
[whack]

38:14.460 --> 38:15.790
[whack]

38:15.830 --> 38:17.120
[whack]

38:17.170 --> 38:19.000
Arrgh!

38:19.040 --> 38:20.040
[whack]

38:20.090 --> 38:21.000
[whack]

38:25.470 --> 38:27.930
I should kill you right here
for what you did to Des.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.340
You're not a killer, Jake.

38:29.390 --> 38:29.640
I have video to prove it.

38:31.010 --> 38:32.680
Oh, well, you know. I'm
gonna go away for murder.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.930
I might as well make it count.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.560
You're never getting that video.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.020
Jake Doyle!

38:38.060 --> 38:38.940
Freeze.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.610
Back off, Jake!

38:46.400 --> 38:46.610
[Rhodes]
Don't worry Jake.

38:47.740 --> 38:48.780
I'll take good care
of your family-

38:48.820 --> 38:50.070
While you're on the inside.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.700
[Mal]
Sorry son.

38:52.740 --> 38:52.990
I thought we had a chance.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.790
At least this way we'll be able
to share a cell together.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.720
Oh my God, Des!

39:10.760 --> 39:13.850
Shhhh. Quiet! This
is a hospital zone.

39:13.890 --> 39:15.220
I'll give you
guys a minute.

39:17.810 --> 39:18.730
Des.

39:18.770 --> 39:20.520
I'm so sorry.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.360
Tinny, it's okay.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.360
All that stuff I said earlier-

39:24.400 --> 39:25.280
It's fine.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.240
Could you just hold my hand?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.580
I sure need a friend right now.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.060
Renee.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.060
Give us a minute?

40:01.730 --> 40:02.850
Mal, what's going on?

40:02.900 --> 40:03.190
We were desperate.

40:04.150 --> 40:04.360
We busted into
Rhodes' place

40:05.520 --> 40:07.190
to see if we could take
him off guard.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.780
He has the footage that
would prove Jake's innocence.

40:09.820 --> 40:11.320
He does?

40:11.360 --> 40:12.780
I take it you
couldn't convince him.

40:12.820 --> 40:13.950
Afraid not.

40:13.990 --> 40:15.990
And what about you?

40:16.030 --> 40:16.240
I don't know why-

40:17.870 --> 40:19.870
But it looks like Rhodes is not
pressing charges against me.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.120
Leslie?

40:22.170 --> 40:23.920
I got fired today.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.540
I'm sorry, luv.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.460
That's not why I'm upset.

40:28.130 --> 40:29.550
I gotta tell Jake.

40:29.590 --> 40:30.550
What is it?

40:31.670 --> 40:33.760
Leslie? You can tell
me anything.

40:37.430 --> 40:38.970
I'm pregnant.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.560
I'm carrying your son's child.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.730
That's wonderful.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.900
This isn't fair.
This is not fair.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.900
You two never had
an opportunity to-

40:51.400 --> 40:52.360
Does Jake know?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.950
Don't tell him. Please.

40:53.990 --> 40:54.320
I gotta be the one.

40:55.490 --> 40:56.990
I gotta look him in the
eye and tell him.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.030
Of course.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.250
I don't know what to say.

41:02.910 --> 41:05.460
I'm always here for
you. I always will be.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.440
You tore up the Chevaliers; bar?

41:32.610 --> 41:34.030
Yeah.

41:42.000 --> 41:42.910
What are you doing?

41:42.950 --> 41:44.000
The right thing.

41:44.040 --> 41:44.960
No, no, no, no.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.420
No Leslie.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.670
I can't let
you do this.

41:47.710 --> 41:48.000
Listen to me,
Jake Doyle.

41:49.380 --> 41:50.590
There's no way in hell I'm
letting you go to prison

41:50.630 --> 41:51.760
for a murder you didn't commit.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.470
So shut up and let's go.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.640
Hood.

41:59.180 --> 42:00.310
Here.

42:00.350 --> 42:01.350
Take my cruiser.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.810
[Jake]
Hood. Buddy.

42:03.850 --> 42:04.140
I don't know
what to say.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.600
Just shut up and punch
me in the face, okay?

42:06.650 --> 42:08.020
It'll save my job. So do it.

42:08.060 --> 42:09.520
This is actually
the one time-

42:09.560 --> 42:11.650
that I don't want to punch
you in the face.

42:11.690 --> 42:11.900
Let me help you, Doyle.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.320
You're the biggest jerk
I ever met.

42:14.650 --> 42:16.780
You're an arrogant, loud,
obnoxious, narcissistic-

42:16.820 --> 42:17.740
- [punch]
- Ugh!

42:18.870 --> 42:19.870
Thanks Hood.

42:21.660 --> 42:22.580
See ya, Hood, pally.

42:27.460 --> 42:30.040
So, Damon Rhodes has
proof of your innocence.

42:31.210 --> 42:31.500
Yeah, I think so.

42:32.920 --> 42:33.210
But I don't know how the hell
we're gonna get it.

42:34.550 --> 42:36.630
Especially with both
sides of the law after us.

42:36.670 --> 42:36.970
And we don't know
who to trust either.

42:38.390 --> 42:39.720
Because we don't know who else
is in Damon Rhodes's

42:39.760 --> 42:41.350
back pocket.

42:41.390 --> 42:42.890
Looks like it's just you and me.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.600
We can do this.

42:45.640 --> 42:46.560
I know we can.

42:47.730 --> 42:49.230
I just hope there's no
more surprises.
