- Murdoch.
- Stand back, sir.

01:48.318 --> 01:50.236
What are you doing shooting
bloody arrows in your office?

01:50.445 --> 01:53.114
I thought it less disruptive
than gunfire.

01:53.323 --> 01:54.741
Don't be a smartass.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.076
Actually, sir, I'm following up
on some reading I've done

01:57.285 --> 02:00.079
about Mongol warriors
and the effects of ballistic impact.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.414
Your first answer was better.

02:01.623 --> 02:04.292
Now get over to the university
and get over there quick.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.045
Ly. Quickly.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.964
His name was Samuel Bennett.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.883
Professor of physics.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.676
He just arrived from England
a few months ago

02:13.885 --> 02:16.095
to head up the department.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.268
Quite the interesting telescope, hmm?

02:22.477 --> 02:23.561
Indeed.

02:23.770 --> 02:24.979
It would appear the professor

02:25.188 --> 02:28.066
was standing near it
when he was shot.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.071
The bullet was fired
from somewhere in the quad.

02:33.279 --> 02:34.697
Well, sir, this was my thinking.

02:34.906 --> 02:38.660
However, I interviewed several... pe--

02:41.037 --> 02:42.247
Good morning, Detective.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.833
Good morning, Doctor.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.544
I'll just examine the body, shall I?

02:48.294 --> 02:50.296
Yes.
Of course.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.509
- You were saying, George?
- Uh, yes.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.427
I spoke with several people
who were in the quad

02:56.636 --> 02:57.554
at the time of the shooting.

02:57.762 --> 03:00.932
A dozen set of eyes,
yet all swore there was no shooter.

03:05.478 --> 03:06.396
Then it would appear

03:06.604 --> 03:09.607
that there is a phantom killer
on the loose.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.745
I'll begin the postmortem
right away.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.998
I'll let you know the results
when I have them.

03:25.582 --> 03:27.417
Thank you, Doctor.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.968
Hmm.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.803
It would appear
Professor Bennett

03:39.012 --> 03:42.891
was talking on the telephone
when he was rudely interrupted.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.643
Let's find out
who he was talking to.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.939
Newton believed light
to be made of particles.

03:50.148 --> 03:51.441
And while it's obvious to us now

03:51.649 --> 03:54.152
that light is the propagation
of waves of energy,

03:54.360 --> 03:57.030
can anyone think
why Newton believed as he did?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.656
Well, a wave

03:58.865 --> 04:00.617
needs something to push against,
does it not?

04:00.825 --> 04:03.244
That's what makes it a wave.

04:03.453 --> 04:06.789
But what is there
to push against in a vacuum?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.249
Therefore the vacuum

04:08.458 --> 04:11.628
must contain
a massless, invisible substance.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.088
An ether, if you will.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.507
Mr. Gillies and Mr. Perry.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.719
You've been reading ahead, haven't you?

04:19.928 --> 04:22.012
No.
It's only logical.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.890
Common sense dictates it.

04:28.728 --> 04:29.979
However they came to it,

04:30.188 --> 04:32.106
Mr. Perry and Mr. Gillies
are correct.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.691
Maxwell's equations

04:33.900 --> 04:37.654
presuppose a universal ether
that permeates space.

04:37.862 --> 04:41.824
And we'll be talking about that
next week.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.618
Good day, gentlemen.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.040
Professor Godfrey.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.500
Detective William Murdoch.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.460
I'm investigating
Professor Bennett's murder.

04:52.669 --> 04:54.295
Uh, I have another class.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.005
Might we continue
this conversation while we walk?

04:56.214 --> 04:58.091
Of course.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.343
I understand you were talking
to Professor Bennett

05:00.551 --> 05:01.761
on the telephone last evening.

05:01.970 --> 05:02.804
How did you know that?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.597
My constable was able to trace the call

05:04.806 --> 05:05.974
through the university switchboard.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.600
Only logical, I suppose.

05:07.809 --> 05:09.769
Can you tell me
what the two of you were discussing?

05:09.978 --> 05:11.521
Comets, if you must know.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.272
He and I were
in somewhat of a competition

05:13.481 --> 05:15.900
to see who would be the first
to spot the return of a comet

05:16.109 --> 05:18.319
Tycho Brahe recorded in 1589.

05:18.528 --> 05:21.614
The switchboard also told me
you were speaking to him at 9:00,

05:21.823 --> 05:23.741
precisely when Professor Bennett
was murdered.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.618
Tell me, how did
your conversation end?

05:25.827 --> 05:27.787
Suddenly.

05:28.538 --> 05:31.916
Look, Detective,
Samuel simply stopped talking.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.835
I didn't know
he'd been murdered, obviously.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.420
I only found that out later.

05:35.628 --> 05:36.671
When was that?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.923
Uh, midnight.
The dean telephoned.

05:39.132 --> 05:41.259
Did you not find it strange
that Professor Bennett

05:41.467 --> 05:43.720
ended the conversation
so abruptly?

05:43.928 --> 05:46.389
Samuel and I
often had heated discussions.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.934
It was nothing for him
to simply hang up or quit talking.

05:50.143 --> 05:51.602
He was a petulant sort.

05:51.811 --> 05:54.022
I take it last night
was one of those conversations.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.231
It was.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.693
I'll need a full account
of your whereabouts last night.

05:59.277 --> 06:02.321
Uh, are you implying that <i>I</i> had
something to do with this?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.283
You admit to having
a stormy relationship with the deceased.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.367
Good God, man.

06:06.576 --> 06:10.621
I was on the phone in my rooms,
talking to the victim!

06:10.830 --> 06:12.373
Isn't that the perfect alibi?

06:12.957 --> 06:15.460
A strange choice of words,
Mr. Godfrey.

06:15.668 --> 06:20.590
I have a few other choice words
to offer, but I'm late.

06:20.798 --> 06:21.924
Now, good day, sir.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.557
Detective.
James Gillies.

06:29.766 --> 06:30.641
Robert Perry.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.602
We were students
of Professor Bennett's.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.104
We couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.939
Professor Godfrey
is a prickly one.

06:37.148 --> 06:38.149
However, like all of us,

06:38.357 --> 06:40.276
he is terribly upset
by Professor Bennett's death.

06:40.485 --> 06:40.943
No doubt.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.071
Nevertheless, you were
just doing your job,

06:43.279 --> 06:45.782
and Godfrey
should have understood that.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.700
Justice requires cooperation.

06:47.909 --> 06:50.036
Please tell me you're not gonna start
quoting Locke again.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.789
Gentlemen, I appreciate
your vote of confidence,

06:52.997 --> 06:54.040
and I will do my best

06:54.248 --> 06:56.667
to apprehend
Professor Bennett's killer.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.002
Well, we appreciate that.

06:58.211 --> 07:00.630
But there's something else
that you should know.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.590
Um, they weren't
exactly friends.

07:02.799 --> 07:04.509
No, I know.
They clashed on occasion.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.885
It was worse than that.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.678
Professor Godfrey
was still bitter.

07:08.638 --> 07:09.806
Bitter?
What about?

07:10.014 --> 07:11.808
He was passed over
for department head.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.601
In favor of Bennett.

07:13.810 --> 07:15.561
He was recruited from England, you know.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.355
Godfrey was still upset.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.815
Apparently,
the board of governors wasn't ready

07:19.023 --> 07:21.818
to appoint a Canadian to head up
such a complex science.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.486
Interesting.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.988
Thank you, gentlemen.
You've been most helpful.

07:26.197 --> 07:28.658
Good luck
with your investigation.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.501
Uh, sir, might I have a word?

07:38.709 --> 07:39.710
Yes, George.
What is it?

07:39.919 --> 07:42.004
Actually, it's a --
it's a personal matter, sir.

07:42.213 --> 07:43.631
I wonder if your office
would be more...

07:43.840 --> 07:46.717
Murdoch!
In my office, sharpish.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.678
I'll be with you in a minute, George.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.388
What happened at the university?

07:50.596 --> 07:53.224
I've had a complaint
from a Professor Godfrey.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.350
Of course.

07:54.559 --> 07:56.519
He seems to think
that you're not up to handling

07:56.727 --> 07:58.604
an important case
like Bennett's murder.

07:58.813 --> 08:00.481
He wants a more senior officer
in charge.

08:00.690 --> 08:01.524
Someone like myself.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.026
Well, sir, I'm sure
you're more than capable --

08:04.235 --> 08:05.111
Relax, Murdoch.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.071
I'm not going
anywhere near the place.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.283
Those intellectual university types
get on my nerves.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.743
Yes. Well, Godfrey
was somewhat belligerent.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.537
Perhaps he's protesting
too much.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.080
What do you mean?

08:16.289 --> 08:18.541
Apparently, he had a grudge
against Professor Bennett.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.002
Something about being passed over
as head of department.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.587
Well, it's my understanding

08:22.795 --> 08:24.130
he was on the phone
at the time of the murder.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.923
Yes.
A fact he made very clear.

08:26.132 --> 08:28.301
He referred to it
as the perfect alibi.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.594
It's an interesting choice
of words.

08:29.802 --> 08:30.845
My thoughts exactly.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.679
Listen, don't take any nonsense

08:32.889 --> 08:34.974
of those bloody eggheads,
me old mucker.

08:35.183 --> 08:36.683
Show them what Toronto coppers
are made of.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.019
Capiche?

08:39.604 --> 08:40.855
Sì.

08:42.273 --> 08:44.107
Oh, sir,
Dr. Ogden has the results...

08:44.317 --> 08:45.735
- ...of the Bennett postmortem.
- Thank you.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.528
And, sir,
that personal matter.

08:47.737 --> 08:50.448
Ah, yes, George. Of course.
What is it?

08:50.656 --> 08:53.534
Well, perhaps
it's because I'm a bachelor

08:53.743 --> 08:55.786
or maybe it's some other reason,

08:55.995 --> 08:59.957
but lately I've found myself
thinking about family.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.002
You're not considering marriage,
are you, George?

09:03.211 --> 09:05.213
Because you haven't mentioned
a sweetheart, and to rush into --

09:05.421 --> 09:07.089
No, no, sir,
not family like that.

09:07.298 --> 09:08.841
Kin.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.719
Ah. Yes.

09:11.928 --> 09:14.889
Well, as you know,
I haven't much family, so...

09:15.097 --> 09:17.975
But do you ever wish
you had them around?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.437
Yes, sometimes.

09:21.646 --> 09:24.482
But, George, why don't you
simply visit your family?

09:24.690 --> 09:26.317
Well, sir, it's not that simple.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.902
I've written this advertisement

09:28.110 --> 09:29.946
I plan to put in
the <i>Toronto Telegram.</i>

09:30.154 --> 09:31.906
- Will you read it?
- Of course.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.702
"Did you leave your baby
at St. James Church

09:36.911 --> 09:41.540
in the care of Reverend Lovell
on or about March 14, 1867?

09:41.749 --> 09:45.253
Police constable wishes
to reunite with his mother."

09:46.087 --> 09:48.297
George, are you a foundling?

09:49.632 --> 09:50.716
I'm afraid so.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.637
But you've often spoken
of your family.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.055
Your auntie, your grandmother...

09:56.264 --> 09:58.391
Sir, I was left on the doorstep
of a church.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.892
The minister's family
took me in.

10:00.101 --> 10:01.310
And, really,
they could not have been kinder,

10:01.519 --> 10:06.315
but I do have a yearning
to find my real mother.

10:07.692 --> 10:10.403
Well, I can understand that.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.822
It's an excellent letter.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.907
Very succinct and to the point.

10:15.116 --> 10:16.158
Oh, thank you, sir.

10:19.662 --> 10:20.997
The bullet entered here.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.249
Then it lodged
near the rear of his skull.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.751
Does the bullet's path
indicate an angle of entry?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.586
From below.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.923
Ah. Consistent with a gunshot
from the quad.

10:31.132 --> 10:33.259
Death was instantaneous.

10:36.387 --> 10:37.847
Have you a bullet?

10:38.055 --> 10:39.473
Yes.
I have it here.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.267
- Ah. It's from a ri--
- It's from a ri--

10:41.475 --> 10:42.226
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

10:42.435 --> 10:44.770
No.
Please, you continue.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.606
It's from a rifle.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.109
Yes.
Yes, I believe so.

10:52.903 --> 10:53.946
Uh...

10:54.155 --> 10:56.365
I have a suspect.

10:56.574 --> 10:58.826
A fellow professor
of the deceased.

10:59.410 --> 11:01.912
He was also a candidate
for chair of the department

11:02.121 --> 11:03.914
but wasn't chosen.

11:04.123 --> 11:06.959
Oh. University politics
can be quite vicious.

11:07.168 --> 11:09.712
Yes, well, I suspect you've had
your share of dealings

11:09.920 --> 11:12.006
with the university's intelligentsia.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.716
None whatsoever, actually.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.344
Their school of medicine
doesn't accept women.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.263
So I'm afraid you'll have to take on
the male bastion alone.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.476
Well, I have Constable Crabtree.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.770
Who I'm sure will bring
his unwavering enthusiasm

11:25.978 --> 11:26.854
to the task.

11:27.063 --> 11:29.815
Yes. Yes.
I'm sure he will.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.082
Perhaps the killer
had some sort of disguise on.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.167
Several of the students
crossing the quad here

11:48.376 --> 11:49.418
were actors in a play.

11:49.627 --> 11:50.795
"Antigone," I believe.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.296
Not that I've seen it.

11:52.505 --> 11:54.548
But they still had
their costumes on.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.217
- Roman robes.
- Togas.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.219
Yes, that's it.
And billowy things they are.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.387
You could hide a rifle
under one.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.765
It still doesn't explain why
no one saw the actual shooting.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.725
Ah, Mr. Perry, Mr. Gillies.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.852
- Detective Murdoch.
- How goes your investigation?

12:07.061 --> 12:08.521
Proceeds apace.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.814
Can we help you with something?

12:10.022 --> 12:11.357
Yes.
One small question.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.359
You mentioned
that Professor Godfrey

12:13.567 --> 12:14.443
did not like Professor Bennett,

12:14.652 --> 12:17.113
but how did your fellow classmates feel
about him?

12:17.321 --> 12:19.115
Oh, everyone loved
the professor.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.409
His mind was second to none,
and he was witty.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.537
And he was everything
that blowhard Godfrey couldn't be.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.455
I see.
I see.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.207
Well, thank you very much.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.711
Detective?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.631
May we be allowed to observe
your investigation?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.925
Observe?
Quite dull, I should think.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.969
Actually, it might prove
an interesting exercise

12:40.177 --> 12:41.137
in applied physics.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.346
What do you think, sir?

12:42.555 --> 12:43.681
Show these young toffs

12:43.889 --> 12:45.224
how things are done
outside the schoolyard?

12:45.433 --> 12:48.060
Something we never see.
The classroom's so theoretical.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.937
Oh.
Can't see the harm.

12:50.146 --> 12:51.397
Why not?

12:52.231 --> 12:54.942
Right, Professor Bennett
was here at his telescope,

12:55.151 --> 12:57.111
looking up at the night sky.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.696
Ready when you are, sir.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.656
Right, then, George.

13:00.865 --> 13:03.909
Come forward several paces.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.581
A little further.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.420
Now right.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.964
- No, <i>your</i> right.
- Oh.

13:17.173 --> 13:20.009
Sorry, sir.
I assumed you meant your right.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.720
I see. So you're determining
the trajectory of the bullet.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.054
And by defining two points
on the line,

13:24.263 --> 13:25.598
you determine all others.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.099
Very Euclidean.

13:27.308 --> 13:28.142
Indeed.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.103
In fact, this is the very method
the Romans first used

13:31.312 --> 13:33.689
to build straight roads
back in 43 A.D.

13:33.898 --> 13:35.441
Fascinating.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.942
Extremely.

13:40.613 --> 13:41.864
That's the spot.

13:42.072 --> 13:45.117
So the top of the stake
represents the rifle's barrel.

13:45.326 --> 13:46.243
That's right.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.912
But if he was kneeling...

13:48.120 --> 13:49.497
Or if he was a dwarf...

13:49.705 --> 13:54.126
If you took it back a bit further,
to about here...

13:54.335 --> 13:56.337
We have one, you know.
A dwarf.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.671
He's in the arts program.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.923
I have a thought.

13:59.131 --> 14:03.177
What if we took the line
farther back to the cobblestone?

14:03.385 --> 14:04.470
Here.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.513
Theoretically, yes.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.682
But the killer would never be
all the way down on the ground.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.935
Unless the professor was killed
by a reflected bullet.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.811
You're a genius, Robert Perry.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.523
Again, in theory.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.566
Surely the killer
would simply face him

14:17.775 --> 14:19.276
and shoot him square on.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.570
Good point.
You're an idiot, Robert Perry.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.573
Oh, hardly. We're simply applying
practical physics.

14:24.782 --> 14:25.991
And it got us nowhere.

14:29.787 --> 14:31.789
On the contrary.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.457
What have you there?

14:34.375 --> 14:38.045
Either our phantom shooter
has transformed himself into sand

14:38.254 --> 14:40.965
or left us a valuable clue.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.644
Sand.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.354
Silica, more specifically.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.648
And you found it at the spot
where the bullet was fired from?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.066
Virtually.

14:59.275 --> 15:01.819
Seems more than a coincidence.
But how does it fit in?

15:02.027 --> 15:03.529
I'm not quite sure yet.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.489
And Godfrey -- Was he involved?

15:05.698 --> 15:08.450
Whoever committed this murder
devised a brilliant plan,

15:08.659 --> 15:11.620
and Professor Godfrey has
a more than capable mind.

15:11.829 --> 15:15.082
Yes. Well, he didn't figure
on your brain, did he?

15:17.293 --> 15:18.919
Thank you, sir.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.172
That was meant as a vote
of confidence, was it not?

15:22.381 --> 15:23.924
Yes, Murdoch.
It was.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.801
Ah.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.304
Carry on.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.346
Yes, yes.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.932
Now, if you want two roads
to meet at a right angle,

15:32.141 --> 15:33.225
then you need a groma.

15:33.434 --> 15:34.560
Well, of course.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.603
What's that?

15:35.811 --> 15:37.813
Uh, it's very technical.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.024
There's someone to see me?

15:43.569 --> 15:44.528
Can I help you, ma'am?

15:44.737 --> 15:45.696
Constable Crabtree?

15:45.904 --> 15:49.450
- Constable George Crabtree?
- Yes.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.413
E-Excuse me.
How very rude.

15:54.622 --> 15:57.291
I-It's just... you're
the spitting image of my brother

15:57.499 --> 15:59.627
when he was a young man.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.588
Mother?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.381
Are you my mother?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.092
I believe that I am.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.263
You saw my advertisement?

16:11.472 --> 16:13.766
Oh, it was so well written.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.768
I can tell
that you were raised well

16:15.976 --> 16:17.853
and -- and looked after properly.

16:18.062 --> 16:19.063
Much more
than I could have done.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.981
I was...

16:21.565 --> 16:23.942
Well, I was just a serving girl,
and I--

16:24.151 --> 16:27.071
Well, my innocence
was taken advantage of.

16:27.279 --> 16:27.988
I didn't have a choice.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.491
But I left you at the church,
where they would care for you.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.743
They were
a good Christian family.

16:33.619 --> 16:34.870
And look at you now.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.539
All grown like you are.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.167
You're a fine, upstanding
young man.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.046
Ah.
There you are, George.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.631
Uh, sir.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.300
I would like you to meet
my mother.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.177
Emily Richardson.

16:50.386 --> 16:51.762
Sir, I'm pleased to meet you.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.473
Detective William Murdoch.
The same.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.601
George and I
were just getting reacquainted.

16:57.810 --> 16:58.394
Ah.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.187
Well, I'm sorry to disrupt,

17:00.396 --> 17:03.315
but, George, we do need to get back
to the university.

17:03.524 --> 17:04.441
Yes, sir.

17:06.193 --> 17:06.902
Ma'am.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.074
Well, I have to go,
but we'll meet later...

17:12.281 --> 17:12.825
Of course.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.910
- ...Mother.
- Of course.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.994
Mother seems like a grand woman.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.038
Yes.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.498
I thought perhaps
I would ask her to attend

17:19.707 --> 17:21.083
the policemen's games
next month.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.126
That would be nice.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.711
And then maybe even take a trip.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.547
Take the boat to Rochester
or something of the sort.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.924
George, this isn't really
my place,

17:29.133 --> 17:32.803
but perhaps you should approach
your reunion with caution.

17:33.011 --> 17:33.846
Why, sir?

17:35.723 --> 17:38.934
The woman did abandon you
once before.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.728
Well, I believe
she had little choice, sir.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.938
I don't think
she would do that again.

17:43.147 --> 17:45.107
Just be careful.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.609
Now, to the matter at hand.

17:49.278 --> 17:52.322
We know that the killer fired his shot
from that spot.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.700
There were people milling about,
yet no one saw anything.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.285
How is that possible?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.662
I'd say
he must have been hidden.

17:58.871 --> 17:59.872
Agreed.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.207
But there's nowhere to hide.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.710
Well, sir, perhaps the killer
hid <i>in</i> something

18:04.918 --> 18:05.961
that was later removed.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.629
A tent or such.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.840
Although I suppose somebody
would have noticed that.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.177
Nevertheless, it was something
no one found suspicious.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.970
How could they not?

18:16.305 --> 18:19.933
Because... it was something
that arrived and stopped

18:20.142 --> 18:22.853
on that exact spot
on a regular basis,

18:23.061 --> 18:26.148
but then left shortly
after the killing

18:26.356 --> 18:28.025
but before our men arrived.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.653
8:45, George.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.574
And if I'm not mistaken,
our answer is arriving now.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.370
We're here every night,
all right, 'round about now.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.664
And how long is your cart
parked here for?

18:42.873 --> 18:45.751
Well, we unload
for about half an hour, and...

18:45.959 --> 18:49.671
well, before we leave, I sneak in
for a pint or two at the pub.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.716
I need 'em to face that harridan
of a wife of mine.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.176
Always looking at me
like I was some kind of --

18:54.384 --> 18:55.886
What time do you depart?

18:56.094 --> 18:59.097
Uh, I'm gone from here
no later than quarter past 9:00.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.766
Any later, and that harpy...

19:00.974 --> 19:02.392
Uh, may I?

19:02.601 --> 19:04.478
Ah. Yeah.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.782
Thank you.
Thank you very much for your time.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.248
So if the killer hid
under the cart,

19:24.456 --> 19:26.250
how come nobody saw him
arrive or leave?

19:26.458 --> 19:29.044
Because the shooter
was never here, George.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.129
He wasn't hiding
in his hiding place?

19:31.338 --> 19:32.965
Precisely.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.557
The rifle was somehow mounted
to the cart's undercarriage.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.100
I'm certain of that.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.644
But then the device's design would
require the killer

19:45.853 --> 19:48.647
to be someone with an advanced
understanding of physics,

19:48.856 --> 19:52.317
which all points to someone
with a grudge against the victim,

19:52.526 --> 19:53.986
Professor Godfrey.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.406
However, that leaves a number
of unanswered questions as well.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.741
How did he trigger the device?

19:59.950 --> 20:01.451
How did the killer slip away unnoticed?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.704
I-I really don't know
how I can help you.

20:03.912 --> 20:07.374
After all, applied physics
is hardly my area of expertise.

20:07.583 --> 20:11.086
Yes, well, nevertheless,
it's always been quite useful

20:11.295 --> 20:12.754
to have a sounding board.

20:12.963 --> 20:13.547
Yes.

20:13.755 --> 20:17.259
Unfortunately, I'm in the middle
of a rather sensitive --

20:17.467 --> 20:18.594
Just one moment.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.262
Excuse me.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.228
I'm sure if you came back later,
I'd be able to...

20:46.997 --> 20:48.415
A devious device, Professor.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.459
Oh, this is absurd.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.046
Prior to your telephone call
to Professor Bennett,

20:54.254 --> 20:57.090
you attached a firing mechanism,
similar to this one,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.384
underneath the coal cart.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.512
Then you attached
a timing device.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.349
An adaptation of an hourglass.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.560
This is absolutely ridiculous!

21:08.769 --> 21:12.314
On the night of the murder,
you set the device in motion.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.113
That gave you time
to get back to your rooms,

21:20.322 --> 21:23.867
telephone Professor Bennett,
and lure him to his telescope,

21:24.076 --> 21:26.495
placing him
in the exact firing line

21:26.703 --> 21:29.164
that you had
carefully calibrated.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.042
The rifle went off
at exactly 9:00.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.213
The work of a brilliant mind.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.840
It is the product
of a deluded imagination.

21:39.049 --> 21:41.385
Who but a physicist could have dreamt up
such a scheme,

21:41.593 --> 21:45.138
let alone set it into motion
with such precision?

21:45.347 --> 21:46.682
I would commend you, sir,

21:46.890 --> 21:48.058
if your intent
weren't so murderous.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.435
Your commendations
would be unfounded.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.063
Your clever little theory
is posited on a faulty premise.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.398
That being?

21:54.606 --> 21:56.858
That my phone call was intended
to lure Professor Bennett

21:57.067 --> 21:58.443
to his telescope.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.404
You said yourself
you were discussing comets.

22:00.612 --> 22:04.408
<i>Discussing</i> comets,
not looking for them.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.243
Think!

22:06.451 --> 22:08.412
The sky was cloudy that night.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.581
You couldn't see the moon,
let alone a comet.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.627
And you call yourself
a detective.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.807
Constable.
You have another visitor.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.142
Who is it?

22:30.350 --> 22:32.394
Well, it's your mother.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.187
Oh, good.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.827
Ooh, he's a good boy, this one.

22:49.036 --> 22:52.706
Oh, I can't believe how much
you look like dear ol' Da.

22:52.914 --> 22:53.540
George?

22:54.833 --> 22:57.836
Oh, I'm so sorry I couldn't have raised
you proper,

22:58.045 --> 23:00.255
but I was just so young!

23:01.590 --> 23:02.924
Constable Crabtree,

23:03.133 --> 23:06.219
I'm afraid I'll be needing
your assistance on the Bennett case.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.971
Uh, yes.
Of course, sir.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.807
I'm sorry, Mother.
Uh, important police work.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.309
Y-You get on, dearie.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.395
What's a few more hours
after all these years?

23:17.731 --> 23:19.191
U-Uh, son?

23:19.399 --> 23:25.072
Um, might you be able to, uh, spare
a dollar?

23:25.280 --> 23:27.324
Just until the end of the week?

23:27.532 --> 23:29.993
Yes. Of course.
Of course.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.453
Um...

23:31.661 --> 23:32.496
Thank you.

23:32.704 --> 23:33.997
- There you go.
- Thank you, son.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.040
Mother.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.458
Oh!

23:37.584 --> 23:39.503
Oh!

23:41.421 --> 23:42.881
Sir, why would two women
come forth

23:43.090 --> 23:44.299
claiming to be my mother?

23:44.508 --> 23:46.426
One of them must be mistaken.

23:46.635 --> 23:47.719
Perhaps, George.

23:47.928 --> 23:52.140
But remember, you do earn a decent wage
and have a pension.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.060
I see what you mean, sir.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.647
As I said earlier,
proceed with caution.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.899
In the meantime,
we have a murder to solve, yes?

24:01.108 --> 24:01.441
Sir.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.819
I'll need all of the Bennett
crime-scene photos immediately.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.862
- Sir.
- Thank you.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.077
Right, then.
Higher, George.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.540
Could the professor
have been lying?

24:16.748 --> 24:19.417
I checked the weather.
It was completely overcast.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.420
But that by no means
exonerates him.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.089
Now more to the right.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.133
<i>Your</i> right.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.847
So, what was he looking at
at the time he was killed?

24:32.055 --> 24:33.765
Precisely.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.725
More, more.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.565
Take a look now.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.404
Sir, it appears the professor

24:47.612 --> 24:50.031
<i>was</i> studying a heavenly body
after all.

24:51.116 --> 24:53.368
It has to do
with Professor Bennett's murder.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.370
We believe
he may have been spying on you

24:55.579 --> 24:56.580
the night that he was killed.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.957
- Yes, I know.
- You know?

24:59.166 --> 25:00.792
All the girls knew
he was a Peeping Tom,

25:01.001 --> 25:03.253
so when I received his note,
I thought, "Why not?"

25:03.461 --> 25:04.504
Note?

25:11.178 --> 25:12.804
He sent it to me.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.640
Said he would pay me
to undress every night at 9:00.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.268
I thought
"Well, he's ogling me anyways.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.270
Why not let him help pay my way
through school?"

25:20.478 --> 25:22.105
So he was soliciting
young ladies,

25:22.314 --> 25:24.107
was he, the saucy old bugger?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.736
That he was full
of the joys of spring

25:27.944 --> 25:30.447
seems to be beyond question,
but he didn't write the note.

25:30.655 --> 25:31.573
He didn't?

25:31.781 --> 25:34.034
I've been going over
Professor Bennett's lecture journals,

25:34.242 --> 25:35.994
and it's not his handwriting.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.787
Oh.

25:37.996 --> 25:42.167
So someone pays Miss Burchill
to undress at precisely 9 p.m.,

25:42.375 --> 25:44.544
knowing that Bennett will be watching
through a telescope,

25:44.753 --> 25:46.880
ensuring he'll be
in the right place to be shot.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.592
Seems like
we're back to Godfrey.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.552
He calls Bennett to chat
about comets,

25:52.761 --> 25:55.180
ensuring he's got the perfect alibi
should anything go wrong.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.473
It's possible.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.476
But I won't know until I have a look
at his handwriting as well.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.103
Of course he's my son!

26:02.312 --> 26:03.855
You're lying through your teeth, missus!

26:04.064 --> 26:06.066
A fine young man
like George would never have

26:06.274 --> 26:08.652
a flea-bitten floozy like you
for a mother!

26:08.860 --> 26:11.363
Anyone looking at him would know
he couldn't belong to you!

26:11.571 --> 26:12.405
Your face is so ugly,

26:12.614 --> 26:14.741
it would make a mule
back away from an oat bin!

26:14.950 --> 26:16.493
- You strumpet!
- Hag!

26:16.701 --> 26:18.036
Mothers, please!

26:18.245 --> 26:20.205
Oi!
Ladies! Ladies!

26:21.539 --> 26:23.333
Although I am profoundly moved

26:23.541 --> 26:25.293
by your display
of motherly love,

26:25.502 --> 26:28.797
please take your dispute
outside my station.

26:29.005 --> 26:31.675
Crabtree!
Sort this out!

26:52.946 --> 26:54.698
Those are Wislicenus' stereoformulae...

26:54.906 --> 26:57.450
- ...for single and double bonds.
- I see.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.453
Rather advanced concepts
to be teaching your students.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.123
I don't believe
in coddling minds.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.375
Now, what might I do for you, Detective?

27:05.583 --> 27:09.671
Why did you pay a young woman
to undress for Professor Bennett?

27:09.879 --> 27:11.923
What sort of ridiculous accusation
is that?!

27:12.132 --> 27:14.426
It was to ensure that he would be
standing at his telescope

27:14.634 --> 27:16.303
at precisely 9:00, wasn't it?

27:16.511 --> 27:17.887
Then again, based on everything
you've uttered

27:18.096 --> 27:20.473
up until this point, should I have
expected otherwise?

27:20.682 --> 27:22.934
Do you deny writing this note?

27:24.644 --> 27:25.437
Yes.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.566
Your script
is quite distinctive,

27:29.774 --> 27:31.234
particularly the H's.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.153
Another faulty assumption
on your part

27:33.361 --> 27:34.696
has led you astray, Detective.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.239
That's not my handwriting.

27:37.032 --> 27:37.699
It isn't?

27:37.907 --> 27:40.076
No. It was written by one
of my teaching assistants.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.454
You are becoming quite tiresome,
Detective.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.414
Your superiors
will hear from me again.

27:44.622 --> 27:45.623
Yes, I'm sure they will.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.793
But if it's all the same,
whose handwriting is it, then?

27:50.211 --> 27:51.546
Why don't you ask him yourself?

27:53.006 --> 27:55.300
So you don't deny writing
this note, Mr. Perry?

27:55.508 --> 27:57.510
It was just a prank.

27:57.719 --> 27:58.636
A prank?

27:58.845 --> 28:00.889
We all knew the professor
liked to watch the girls,

28:01.097 --> 28:03.183
so we thought we'd have some fun
with him.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.810
Fun?

28:06.019 --> 28:07.812
And do you think it was fun

28:08.021 --> 28:10.273
that you specified Miss Burchill
remove her clothing

28:10.482 --> 28:13.610
at precisely the moment
that Professor Bennett was shot?

28:13.818 --> 28:15.195
That -- That's a coincidence.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.239
A coincidence?

28:18.448 --> 28:20.533
That's a rather spectacular one,
you'd have to agree.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.328
Well, the meaning of coincidence
is utterly subjective

28:23.536 --> 28:26.956
and can be evaluated
only by the person experiencing it.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.502
And where were you the night
of Professor Bennett's murder?

28:31.544 --> 28:32.545
At the pub.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.589
You're quite sure?

28:35.173 --> 28:36.174
Yes.
That's right.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.388
Can anyone substantiate this?

28:41.596 --> 28:44.349
Gillies.
He was with me.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.601
There were others there, too.

28:47.477 --> 28:49.604
And what was your relationship like
with the deceased?

28:49.813 --> 28:51.898
You can't think I had something to do
with his death?

28:52.107 --> 28:53.942
Answer the question, Mr. Perry.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.903
I admired him.

28:57.112 --> 28:59.739
It was a privilege
to study under him.

29:00.865 --> 29:03.076
And where were you
the night before the murder?

29:03.284 --> 29:04.619
Uh, studying.

29:06.413 --> 29:07.539
Alone?

29:08.123 --> 29:09.624
With Gillies.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.376
Of course.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.253
I believe
if there's nothing more,

29:13.461 --> 29:15.588
I-I should be allowed to go now.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.510
Yes. For now, Mr. Perry.
For now.

29:36.568 --> 29:39.154
Just good pals
or something more?

29:39.362 --> 29:41.322
I'd say they're hiding something.

29:41.531 --> 29:42.657
Agreed.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.242
And Godfrey?

29:44.451 --> 29:46.286
The letter all but rules him out
as a suspect.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.413
But if it is them,
what's their motive?

29:48.621 --> 29:49.956
I thought they liked the victim.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.000
That was my understanding
as well.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.585
How did Mr. Perry strike you?

29:53.793 --> 29:54.794
Nervous.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.088
Like he was trying to remember
his story.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.256
And Mr. Gillies?

29:58.465 --> 30:00.467
Like a bloody iceberg.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.178
Then I suggest one way
to solve this case

30:03.386 --> 30:05.346
is by focusing our efforts
on Mr. Perry.

30:05.555 --> 30:06.639
And break him with what?

30:06.848 --> 30:07.724
We've got no hard evidence,

30:07.932 --> 30:10.310
and his daddy's barristers are
probably en route as we speak.

30:10.518 --> 30:11.561
Applied physics.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.189
Even a planet can be moved
with the proper leverage.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.274
I just have to find it.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.952
Sir?
I'm sorry to interrupt.

30:28.161 --> 30:28.995
Yes, George.
What is it?

30:29.204 --> 30:30.663
I'm at my wits' end, sir.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.916
I-I don't know how to determine

30:33.124 --> 30:35.126
which of my two mothers
is my mother.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.170
It's like the dilemma
Samson faced.

30:39.672 --> 30:40.173
Samson?

30:40.381 --> 30:42.133
Yes, sir.
Samson from the Bible.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.219
You mean Solomon, George.

30:44.427 --> 30:45.303
No, sir. Samson.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.597
Two mothers --
They had this little baby,

30:47.805 --> 30:50.391
and they asked him to choose
which was the rightful mother.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.311
And he suggested
cutting the baby in half.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.188
Yes, that's the correct story,

30:55.396 --> 30:57.941
but it was Solomon
who was the wise king.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.735
Samson had the long hair
and Delilah.

31:00.944 --> 31:02.320
I don't see how having long hair

31:02.529 --> 31:04.948
would affect his ability
to render sound judgment.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.991
You're conflating
two different characters, George.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.494
Well, we'll have to agree
to disagree on this one, sir.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.496
Indeed we will.

31:11.704 --> 31:15.041
But it is very much
like the biblical dilemma, yes.

31:16.251 --> 31:18.878
Which gives me an idea.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.505
Sir, if you're suggesting
cutting me in half,

31:20.713 --> 31:23.049
we'll have to agree to disagree
on that point, also.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.468
No, no, George.
There'll be no cutting.

31:25.677 --> 31:28.263
However, I will need you
to pay a visit to my tailor.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.271
Doctor.
I'm sure you're quite busy.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.981
I wonder if I could have
your assistance.

31:38.189 --> 31:39.315
Of course, Detective.

31:39.524 --> 31:41.693
I'm always available to discuss
matters of pathology.

31:41.901 --> 31:44.445
That's my job.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.492
Julia, I know that things

31:49.701 --> 31:51.786
have become somewhat awkward
between us.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.539
But you should know that
I have always thought of you

31:54.747 --> 31:56.624
as much more than a pathologist.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.626
And I hope that
that can continue.

31:59.210 --> 32:02.714
Well, I suppose
there's no harm in trying.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.090
How can I help you?

32:05.133 --> 32:06.467
I have a question.

32:06.676 --> 32:09.095
Is this concerning
Professor Bennett?

32:09.721 --> 32:11.639
Yes and no.

32:16.144 --> 32:18.479
Why am I here, Detective?

32:18.688 --> 32:19.731
Because I told you I had nothing

32:19.939 --> 32:22.275
to do with
the professor's murder.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.944
And I believe you, Mr. Perry,

32:25.153 --> 32:26.863
but what I need from you
is help.

32:27.614 --> 32:28.281
Help?

32:28.489 --> 32:30.366
I'm just a police officer.

32:30.575 --> 32:34.370
And the physics involved in
this murder are far beyond me.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.582
Very well.
How might I assist you?

32:38.833 --> 32:40.918
We must hurry.
It's nearing 9:00.

32:41.127 --> 32:44.505
If you would oblige me, please,
and look through the telescope.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.764
Very good. Now you'll need
the telephone in your hand.

32:52.972 --> 32:53.931
If you would, George, please.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.391
Sir, right away.

32:56.392 --> 32:59.187
Eye on the eyepiece, please,
Mr. Perry.

33:00.271 --> 33:01.856
How does it feel?

33:02.065 --> 33:05.026
Knowing your head is in the same spot
Professor Bennett's was

33:05.234 --> 33:06.611
when he was shot?

33:06.819 --> 33:07.737
Telephone, sir.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.742
George!

33:14.118 --> 33:15.453
George!

33:15.662 --> 33:18.373
Don't just stand there, man!
Telephone an ambulance!

33:19.165 --> 33:20.208
George!

33:41.646 --> 33:43.773
I want answers, Mr. Perry,
and I want them now.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.234
I had nothing to do
with your constable being shot.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.527
I was in the room with you, remember?

33:47.735 --> 33:50.238
Right now, Constable Crabtree
is fighting for his life.

33:50.446 --> 33:51.406
He is a colleague of mine.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.826
Do you think I'm going to rest
until his assailant is found?

33:55.034 --> 33:57.995
Do you think any police officer
in this city will?

33:58.579 --> 34:00.957
Do you have any idea
what we do to someone

34:01.165 --> 34:02.542
who dares harm one of our own?

34:02.750 --> 34:04.210
This is ridiculous.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.962
I don't know anything about it.

34:12.009 --> 34:12.885
Gillies, right?

34:13.094 --> 34:14.262
Yes.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.304
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.306
- You wanted to see me?
- Uh, yes.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.268
I was wondering...

34:20.476 --> 34:22.812
what was happening
with my friend Mr. Perry.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.147
I would think right about now

34:24.355 --> 34:27.024
he's probably getting
the biggest bollocking of his life.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.652
What I can't understand --
and perhaps you can enlighten me --

34:29.860 --> 34:32.572
is why you chose Constable Crabtree
as your target.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.616
How many times
do I have to tell you?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.534
Unless you didn't.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.040
Unless the shot wasn't intended for him.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.710
I-I don't understand.

34:45.918 --> 34:49.880
Constable Crabtree stepped
between the window and you.

34:52.592 --> 34:53.134
You mean...

34:53.342 --> 34:55.762
I've been looking at this
all wrong.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.806
The killer was targeting you.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.310
I wouldn't be too concerned
about your pal.

35:02.518 --> 35:03.644
He seems like a sensible sort.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.313
Yes, he is that.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.190
Then he's got nothing
to worry about.

35:07.398 --> 35:09.776
If he's not guilty,
then no matter what

35:09.984 --> 35:12.153
he's threatened with,
he's got nothing to fear, right?

35:12.361 --> 35:13.613
Right.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.741
Would you like a spot of tea?

35:17.992 --> 35:19.076
That would be lovely.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.752
Who would want to shoot me?

35:29.253 --> 35:31.798
Someone who was worried
you might incriminate him.

35:32.006 --> 35:33.883
In what?

35:34.091 --> 35:35.384
You know very well what.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.054
You and Mr. Gillies
murdered Professor Bennett.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.056
I have no idea why,
but you did it.

35:40.765 --> 35:42.391
We've been through this.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.852
I had nothing to do
with his death.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.814
And I'd like to see
my barrister now.

35:51.067 --> 35:52.860
Mr. Perry...

35:53.069 --> 35:56.197
someone tried to shoot you
last night.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.950
And we both know who that was.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.832
I can't help you
if you don't let me.

36:06.499 --> 36:08.084
If that's all...

36:10.545 --> 36:11.712
Suit yourself.

36:11.921 --> 36:14.799
I have more important matters
to tend to.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.887
But don't say I didn't warn you.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.060
How are you holding up, Robert?

36:30.189 --> 36:32.358
Wait, Robert!

36:35.486 --> 36:36.571
Despite his injuries,

36:36.779 --> 36:39.115
Constable Crabtree remains
resolute and courageous.

36:39.323 --> 36:40.658
My poor Georgie.

36:40.867 --> 36:42.410
It was a terrible,
terrible accident.

36:42.618 --> 36:45.705
What a brave man.
Injured in the course of duty.

36:48.958 --> 36:49.417
Doctor.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.627
Good afternoon, ladies.

36:51.836 --> 36:53.629
What's the latest news?

36:53.838 --> 36:56.257
I'm afraid it's not good,
Detective Murdoch.

36:57.592 --> 36:59.719
The bullet is lodged
in George's spine.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.220
Oh.

37:01.429 --> 37:02.930
He'll not walk again?

37:03.139 --> 37:03.973
He's paralyzed.

37:04.181 --> 37:05.683
Oh, poor George.
Such a good soul.

37:05.892 --> 37:08.394
He deserves better than this.

37:08.603 --> 37:10.229
Indeed he does.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.148
Ladies, put away the hankies.

37:12.356 --> 37:15.985
One of you is a fake,
and it's time to end this charade now.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.946
I would think it's obvious
who the impostor is.

37:19.155 --> 37:21.908
Well, I'm not the one
putting on airs and graces.

37:22.116 --> 37:23.618
Enough from both of you.

37:24.410 --> 37:27.747
A fine, upstanding young man
has been severely injured.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.415
Constable Crabtree
needs his mother --

37:29.624 --> 37:31.500
his real mother --
to be by his side.

37:31.709 --> 37:34.629
Whatever you hoped to gain
from this deception --

37:34.837 --> 37:36.505
Constable Crabtree's pension,

37:36.714 --> 37:38.841
his status
as an officer of the law --

37:39.050 --> 37:40.259
it all ends now.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.138
A good man needs care
for the rest of his life.

37:45.473 --> 37:48.225
Which one of you will go to him?

37:58.736 --> 37:59.820
Mother?

38:00.655 --> 38:01.948
I'm here, son.

38:03.199 --> 38:04.867
I'm here.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.048
Good morning, gentlemen.

38:27.139 --> 38:32.103
This morning, we have
a somewhat unorthodox guest.

38:33.521 --> 38:36.816
Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto Constabulary.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.151
Detective.

38:42.113 --> 38:43.614
Gentlemen.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.033
Professor Godfrey
has asked me to address you

38:46.242 --> 38:49.829
on matters
of applied physics today.

38:57.211 --> 39:00.423
No doubt you are all familiar...

39:02.091 --> 39:03.384
...with one of these.

39:04.677 --> 39:05.970
You are probably all wondering

39:06.178 --> 39:08.347
what this has to do
with the study of physics,

39:08.556 --> 39:11.392
but I can assure you
the act of hanging a man

39:11.600 --> 39:14.854
requires a rigorous application
of Newtonian principles.

39:15.062 --> 39:17.940
Now, a successful hanging

39:18.149 --> 39:23.654
results in the breaking
of the neck at the first vertebra.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.828
Can anyone tell me
the variables required

39:31.037 --> 39:33.914
to determine the amount of force
needed to break a neck?

39:34.123 --> 39:35.166
Anyone?

39:35.374 --> 39:36.459
Mr. Gillies?

39:37.877 --> 39:42.465
Force is simply the product
of mass times acceleration.

39:42.673 --> 39:43.340
Exactly.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.217
Or in this case,

39:45.426 --> 39:49.555
rapid deceleration
as the rope snaps taut.

39:50.473 --> 39:51.682
And mass, of course,

39:51.891 --> 39:54.060
is represented
by the weight of the body.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.645
Um, Mr. Perry.

39:56.854 --> 39:58.564
How much do you weigh,
Mr. Perry?

40:01.108 --> 40:02.193
Mr. Perry?

40:02.777 --> 40:04.653
155 pounds.

40:04.862 --> 40:07.782
155 pounds.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.076
Now, using the hangman's calculation,

40:10.284 --> 40:12.411
the amount of rope needed
to break the neck

40:12.620 --> 40:17.750
of a 155-pound man is 9 feet.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.461
Now, can anyone tell me
what speed Mr. Perry's body

40:20.669 --> 40:23.547
would be traveling
as the rope snaps taut at 9 feet?

40:23.756 --> 40:26.425
I-I think this is all
in utterly poor taste.

40:26.634 --> 40:28.177
Let's see.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.559
24 feet per second.

40:35.768 --> 40:37.978
Applied physics.

40:38.187 --> 40:41.273
Now, for the second lesson.

40:41.482 --> 40:42.900
In the real world,

40:43.109 --> 40:47.696
just as there is no perfect vacuum
and no perfect circle,

40:47.905 --> 40:50.533
there is no perfect murder.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.535
Isn't that right, Mr. Gillies?

40:52.743 --> 40:54.912
If you say so, sir.

40:55.121 --> 40:58.499
Yet here I am,
investigating one.

41:01.919 --> 41:04.672
Now, how does a simple man
such as myself

41:04.880 --> 41:08.217
go about investigating
this perfect murder?

41:09.218 --> 41:12.638
He leaves textbooks behind
and uses hard work.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.183
I have a list here.

41:16.392 --> 41:19.812
Anyone care to hazard a guess
as to its contents?

41:20.688 --> 41:21.772
Mr. Perry?

41:23.649 --> 41:24.608
I couldn't.

41:24.817 --> 41:27.153
No.
Of course not.

41:27.862 --> 41:31.115
Earlier, I determined
the components necessary

41:31.323 --> 41:33.742
to commit this perfect murder --

41:33.951 --> 41:37.913
things such as screws,
wood, metal,

41:38.122 --> 41:40.583
rifle shells,
et cetera, et cetera.

41:40.791 --> 41:45.045
My men checked every supplier
in the city that sold these items,

41:45.254 --> 41:47.506
and they compiled a list
of everyone

41:47.715 --> 41:50.426
who had purchased these items
in the past three months.

41:50.634 --> 41:53.554
One name
was of particular interest.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.640
Care to guess
what that name was, Mr. Perry?

41:56.849 --> 41:59.018
I think this has gone
quite far enough.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.520
I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Gillies.

42:03.022 --> 42:04.440
It's your name, Mr. Perry.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.864
I wonder, how is it possible

42:12.072 --> 42:15.618
that a smart young man
such as yourself

42:15.826 --> 42:18.037
would have bought
all of the supplies?

42:18.245 --> 42:20.873
Because as a result,
you are now the only person

42:21.081 --> 42:23.417
that can be connected
to Professor Bennett's murder.

42:23.626 --> 42:26.795
Nonsense.
That's just some list.

42:27.004 --> 42:27.922
It means nothing.

42:28.130 --> 42:31.967
I suspect
that you were outsmarted...

42:32.176 --> 42:33.344
by none other than Mr. Gillies.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.095
Don't listen to him, Robert.

42:35.304 --> 42:36.388
There are only two ways for you

42:36.597 --> 42:40.517
to avoid this 9-foot drop,
Mr. Perry.

42:40.726 --> 42:44.355
One is to confess your crime
and to name your accomplice.

42:44.939 --> 42:46.315
- And the other?
- Robert, don't.

42:46.523 --> 42:47.733
Shut up, James.

42:47.942 --> 42:50.319
The other is to let your partner
silence you,

42:50.527 --> 42:51.946
so you can never talk,

42:52.154 --> 42:53.906
which he has
already tried before.

42:54.114 --> 42:56.450
I did nothing of the sort!

42:56.659 --> 42:58.369
It's up to you, Mr. Perry.

42:58.953 --> 43:02.039
Robert, don't listen to him.
You see what he's trying to do.

43:03.499 --> 43:04.500
It wasn't my idea.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.752
Shut up, you fool.

43:07.461 --> 43:09.296
The timing device --
That was his invention.

43:09.505 --> 43:10.881
You bloody coward.

43:11.090 --> 43:13.050
You tried to kill me.

43:13.259 --> 43:14.677
No, I didn't.

43:14.885 --> 43:16.512
Whatever they said,
it was a trick.

43:17.888 --> 43:19.974
Unfortunately, he's right,
Mr. Perry.

43:22.685 --> 43:23.894
Ah.

43:24.103 --> 43:27.481
Constable Crabtree,
good to see you on your feet again.

43:27.690 --> 43:29.358
Thank you, sir.

43:29.566 --> 43:30.985
But how...

43:37.825 --> 43:40.661
The final lesson
in applied physics.

43:40.869 --> 43:44.206
This is a bulletproof vest
based on the principles

43:44.415 --> 43:47.668
discovered by Mongol warriors
in the 13th century.

43:47.876 --> 43:49.086
It's made of silk.

43:49.295 --> 43:51.463
Layer over layer
over layer of silk.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.340
And just for good measure,
there is a...

43:53.549 --> 43:55.259
...metal plate

43:55.467 --> 43:57.970
that renders the bullet harmless.

44:02.474 --> 44:04.351
All right, you two,
on your feet.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.353
Constables.

44:06.562 --> 44:09.231
Come on, move it.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.150
Detective.

44:11.358 --> 44:15.362
Professor Godfrey, thank you very much
for your cooperation.

44:15.571 --> 44:18.240
I believe I may have underestimated you.

44:18.449 --> 44:19.325
And I you.

44:19.533 --> 44:20.701
Hm.

44:20.909 --> 44:23.579
Yes. I'd give you an A-minus,
I think.

44:23.787 --> 44:26.081
Minus?

44:26.290 --> 44:29.043
Well,
as you've so clearly proven,

44:29.251 --> 44:32.421
in the real world,
nothing is perfect.

44:33.881 --> 44:36.717
No.
No, it isn't.

44:39.219 --> 44:42.014
So the bullet didn't actually bounce off
the jacket.

44:42.222 --> 44:44.308
It was stopped
by the silk and steel.

44:44.516 --> 44:45.684
Well, I never.

44:45.893 --> 44:47.519
It left a nasty bruise, though.

44:47.728 --> 44:51.190
Well, it was a terrible trick
to play on your mother.

44:52.274 --> 44:54.193
Well, you did leave me
on a doorstep,

44:54.401 --> 44:57.112
even if it was a church.

44:57.321 --> 44:59.114
I hope that in time

44:59.323 --> 45:03.160
we can come to truly care
for each other, Georgie.

45:03.369 --> 45:05.245
Do you think we can?

45:05.454 --> 45:08.999
I think we could take our time,
see how we get on.

45:09.208 --> 45:11.251
That sounds very sensible.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.713
Just what I'd expect from my son,
the brave policeman.

45:33.482 --> 45:34.608
Detective.

45:36.068 --> 45:37.152
How can I help you?

45:37.361 --> 45:39.488
I came by to thank you
for your help.

45:39.696 --> 45:41.323
You played an excellent part
in the charade.

45:42.574 --> 45:44.618
Well, it was my pleasure
to assist Constable Crabtree.

45:46.787 --> 45:50.290
Am I to assume that Mr. Gillies
and Mr. Perry will hang?

45:50.874 --> 45:51.875
Well, I'm not so sure.

45:52.084 --> 45:54.628
Their families will hire
the best lawyers in the land.

45:54.837 --> 45:58.006
But at the very least,
they can look forward to life in prison.

45:58.215 --> 45:59.383
Where they will have

45:59.591 --> 46:01.051
plenty of time
for their studies.

46:01.260 --> 46:02.553
But what was their motive?

46:02.761 --> 46:05.097
I believe that Mr. Gillies
simply had a theory

46:05.305 --> 46:06.432
and wanted to test it.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.350
Applied physics.

46:08.559 --> 46:10.352
And Mr. Perry,
for whatever reason,

46:10.561 --> 46:11.770
went along with him.

46:11.979 --> 46:13.480
How monstrous.

46:13.689 --> 46:15.107
