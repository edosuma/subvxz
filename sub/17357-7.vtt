WEBVTT

00:06.896 --> 00:08.090
You know who I am?

00:08.090 --> 00:10.949
Yeah, you know who I am.

00:10.950 --> 00:12.843
And I know who you are.

00:12.844 --> 00:15.633
And I know you've got that missing girl.

00:15.634 --> 00:17.892
(Dramatic theme playing)

00:17.893 --> 00:19.188
Uhh!

00:19.189 --> 00:23.267
1661 Oakwood Drive.

00:23.974 --> 00:25.701
Montauk.

00:25.702 --> 00:28.589
You're going away for
a long time, dirt-face.

00:28.590 --> 00:29.986
We got you on murder.

00:29.987 --> 00:33.640
No. No, wait. I see... I see a girl.

00:33.641 --> 00:35.867
She's there willingly.

00:35.868 --> 00:39.947
It's some kind of weird sexual role-play.

00:40.617 --> 00:42.445
Damn it. That's not even a crime.

00:42.446 --> 00:45.434
- Why would he hide that?
- Wedding ring. He's married.

00:45.435 --> 00:47.593
Adultery. That's a class B miz.

00:47.594 --> 00:51.413
Hear that, slut-boy? You're
looking at 30 days hard time

00:51.414 --> 00:53.441
- in the clink.
- Or a small fine.

00:53.442 --> 00:55.069
This is going to be one rap on the wrist

00:55.070 --> 00:57.925
this perv won't enjoy.

00:57.926 --> 00:59.653
Announcer: Coming up next, the news.

00:59.654 --> 01:02.711
I miss Camomile.

01:02.712 --> 01:05.867
Maybe I should just call her, right?

01:05.868 --> 01:07.893
I'm just going to call her.
I'm just going to call her.

01:07.894 --> 01:10.419
You know? I'll call her up.

01:14.572 --> 01:16.232
(Clears throat)

01:16.233 --> 01:19.720
- (Ghost gurgles)
- Shh.

01:19.721 --> 01:22.611
Camomile (On voice mail): This is
Camomile White. Leave a message.

01:22.612 --> 01:25.503
- (Beep)
- Hey, bitch. It...

01:27.231 --> 01:28.724
(Moans softly)

01:28.725 --> 01:31.548
Uh, sorry. That was
my... that was my, uh...

01:31.549 --> 01:35.169
my barber.. shop quartet friends.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.598
They were just leaving.

01:36.599 --> 01:40.850
Uh, anyway, it's me,
Kevin Pacalioglu again.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.275
Uh, just calling to say, "what's up?"

01:43.276 --> 01:47.795
And check in on you and just,
uh, ask you the question,

01:47.796 --> 01:49.422
"whatever happened to us?"

01:49.423 --> 01:51.083
Just, you know, a simple question.

01:51.084 --> 01:53.808
The elephant in the room.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.568
Man: Another cave-in during construction

01:55.569 --> 01:57.164
of the Second Avenue subway line

01:57.165 --> 01:58.724
has workers threatening to strike.

01:58.725 --> 02:01.050
Other lines will be shut
down for precaution,

02:01.051 --> 02:04.306
so if you plan on traveling
today, be safe out there.

02:04.307 --> 02:08.386
And that is the reason I am not
allowed in Applebee's anymore.

02:09.056 --> 02:11.283
Any Applebee's. It's like a nationwide ban.

02:11.284 --> 02:13.309
It's crazy.

02:13.310 --> 02:16.433
(Sighs): So, you know, if you
ever want to go out sometime,

02:16.434 --> 02:19.090
uh, give me a call. I'm around.

02:19.091 --> 02:21.516
It's been way too long. Uh...

02:21.517 --> 02:23.941
speaking of things that are way too long,

02:23.942 --> 02:25.603
this voice mail is one of them.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.894
Heh, heh. Fits into that category.

02:27.895 --> 02:29.389
But you know what they say.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.583
Long voice mail, uh...

02:38.327 --> 02:39.523
that was pretty good.

02:39.524 --> 02:42.014
(Whimpers)

02:42.015 --> 02:43.710
I'm going to call her again.

02:45.935 --> 02:47.131
Shh.

02:47.132 --> 02:49.024
(Line ringing)

02:49.025 --> 02:51.251
Hey, bitch. I...

02:52.879 --> 02:55.138

Advertise your product or brand here

03:25.802 --> 03:27.863
(Mysterious theme playing)

03:33.345 --> 03:35.203
Hey!

03:35.204 --> 03:37.097
Thanks for only being an hour late.

03:37.098 --> 03:40.720
Yeah, my pleasure, man. Can't
wait to start the ransacking.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.247
What the hell is that helmet?

03:42.248 --> 03:44.739
It's my viking helmet, for the ransacking.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.597
- You know, for the pillaging.
- Man, for the last time,

03:47.598 --> 03:49.757
there's not gonna be no
ransacking or pillaging.

03:49.758 --> 03:52.314
I bought a house in
foreclosure for dirt cheap.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.606
We're gonna spruce it up,
put it back on the market

03:54.607 --> 03:56.102
for more than I bought it.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.893
Yeah, but I can still keep
all the goodies I ransacked?

03:58.894 --> 04:01.782
Hell, yeah, you can. Just
get rid of that helmet.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.242
If anything, you're more of
a scavenger, not a viking.

04:04.243 --> 04:06.666
- Okay. I can work with that.
- You can work with that?

04:06.667 --> 04:08.628
But can you work with this?

04:08.629 --> 04:12.015
- Oh. Is that what I think it is?
- Yup. Pot chocolates.

04:12.016 --> 04:14.009
They make your day more fun, you know?

04:14.010 --> 04:16.632
I don't know, Roofie. You and I
don't do so well with edibles.

04:16.634 --> 04:18.694
You know what? They're not
supposed to be that strong.

04:18.695 --> 04:20.023
- No?
- Nah.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.515
- You know you like it.
- Just a couple squares.

04:22.516 --> 04:24.741
Now, this is the house.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.967
You own this?

04:29.991 --> 04:33.676
It's like Silence of The
Lambs up in this bitch.

04:33.677 --> 04:36.102
I don't know. I think this
bitch looks pretty sweet.

04:36.103 --> 04:38.328
Yeah, but we'll have to put
a lot of elbow grease in

04:38.329 --> 04:39.790
if we wanna sell it.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.717
Yeah, or we could find some
owners who are into it,

04:41.718 --> 04:44.806
- you know, as is.
- Oh, like a serial killer?

04:44.807 --> 04:46.965
Yeah, or, like, a wizard.

04:46.966 --> 04:50.389
Man, this don't look like none
of the pictures on the site

04:50.390 --> 04:52.449
that I bought it on. Well, I don't know.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.276
Wait a minute. You've never even been here?

04:54.277 --> 04:57.466
No. I bought in on a
site. Look, check it out.

04:58.495 --> 05:00.489
There's no signal.

05:00.490 --> 05:01.984
Must be a dead zone.

05:01.985 --> 05:05.438
I gotta say, Roofie, honestly, I'm, uh...

05:05.439 --> 05:09.656
I'm seeing about zero potential
with this place altogether.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.316
What are you talking about,
man? Just use your imagination.

05:12.317 --> 05:14.808
Once we clear all this
stuff out, it'll be nice.

05:14.809 --> 05:18.262
I'm not touching these dolls.
These are creeping me out.

05:18.263 --> 05:20.887
But this on the other hand. But this
looks like a pretty sweet little...

05:20.888 --> 05:24.129
- it's a tempur-pedic.
- That is most definitely not a tempur-pedic.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.432
Yeah it is. I'm scavenging this.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.717
This is what scavenging
is all about. Right here.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.226
We gotta start somewhere. Come on.

05:29.227 --> 05:31.652
- It's light for a tempur-pedic.
- It's heavy to me.

05:31.653 --> 05:33.844
- Oh, hey, Roofie.
- Huh?

05:33.845 --> 05:35.638
Remember those dolls we were talking about,

05:35.639 --> 05:37.199
- like, two seconds ago?
- Yeah.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.259
Yeah, now there's, like, an identical set

05:39.260 --> 05:41.719
lined up out here in the hall.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.779
Roofie: Aah! What?

05:43.780 --> 05:45.405
Aah!

05:45.406 --> 05:46.701
(Both scream)

05:46.702 --> 05:49.325
Kevin: Okay. What is this?

05:49.326 --> 05:51.121
(Dramatic theme plays)

05:55.041 --> 05:57.134
(Mysterious theme playing)

05:59.094 --> 06:01.717
- Mine won't open!
- Kevin: I know. Me, neither.

06:01.718 --> 06:04.211
Man, I can't believe I
bought a haunted house.

06:04.212 --> 06:06.701
That's why it was so cheap.

06:06.702 --> 06:08.727
You know what? I must be tripping.

06:08.728 --> 06:11.486
Maybe that's it. Maybe we're
still high from the chocolates.

06:11.487 --> 06:13.579
- You think so?
- No. I was just saying that

06:13.580 --> 06:15.540
to make you feel better. This
place is definitely haunted.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.332
Oh, God. Come on, man. Look, look, look.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.094
You're a medium. Use your medium skills.

06:19.095 --> 06:21.520
Do something. Talk to the
ghost. Find out what it wants.

06:21.521 --> 06:23.978
I don't know, Roofie. Even if I find him,

06:23.979 --> 06:26.935
there's no guarantee he's gonna
talk. Even if I do get him to talk,

06:26.936 --> 06:28.994
there's no guarantee that I'm gonna listen.

06:28.995 --> 06:33.215
What? Could you please just
talk to the ghost, okay?

06:33.216 --> 06:35.905
What do you want, my soul or my money?

06:35.906 --> 06:38.995
Stop, stop, stop. Calm down. Stop it.

06:38.996 --> 06:40.522
Listen. Stop, stop. It's okay.

06:40.523 --> 06:42.550
I'll do it. What are you gonna do?

06:42.551 --> 06:44.244
We split up. Scooby Doo style.

06:44.245 --> 06:45.971
I'm gonna find another way out of here.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.031
- Kevin: Okay. Good plan.
- They're not taking me alive.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.988
(Mysterious theme playing)

06:50.989 --> 06:52.949
(Child laughs)

06:58.797 --> 07:00.989
Hello, ghost?

07:04.245 --> 07:06.304
Okay.

07:06.305 --> 07:07.898
Way to go, house.

07:07.899 --> 07:10.323
You have successfully
freaked out my friend.

07:10.324 --> 07:13.114
Really, really, really amazing. Great job.

07:13.115 --> 07:16.437
Can't freak me out, though.
No. I'm a professional.

07:16.438 --> 07:18.065
I'm a professional at this.

07:18.066 --> 07:20.191
Wanna come out and have a
little one-on-one chat with me?

07:20.192 --> 07:23.049
That'd be easy, huh?

07:23.050 --> 07:27.128
But no, no. You wanna resort to
these ice cream parlor tricks.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.660
Look at this. Oldest one in the book.

07:29.661 --> 07:32.084
Shutters on the windows are
locked. Come on, piece of cake.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.712
Piece of cake.

07:33.713 --> 07:37.634
Unh. That is really hooked
on there tight, huh?

07:37.635 --> 07:39.729
(Suspenseful theme playing)

07:50.227 --> 07:52.484
Piece of cake!

07:52.485 --> 07:54.909
Unh! Oh! Oh!

07:54.910 --> 07:58.989
Oh. Oh, my God. Did that
actually just happen?

07:59.695 --> 08:02.617
Oh, God. I think my ass is broken.

08:02.618 --> 08:04.910
Oh, it was worth it.

08:04.911 --> 08:06.937
It feels good to laugh. I needed that.

08:06.938 --> 08:09.694
- This floor is hard as a rock.
- Yeah, no kidding.

08:09.695 --> 08:12.019
My stupid wife, Julep,
didn't want carpeting.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.846
"Hardwood is classier."

08:13.847 --> 08:16.670
Ohh. Was it too much to ask for a rug?

08:16.671 --> 08:18.697
That's what I said. I keep telling her.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.488
If we're gonna work on the
house, it's gotta be practical.

08:21.489 --> 08:24.443
Not this froufrou design crap.

08:24.444 --> 08:26.337
Uhh!

08:26.338 --> 08:29.761
Yeah. There is a lot of
froufrou around here.

08:29.762 --> 08:32.484
I'm definitely gonna talk to
Roofie about that rug thing,

08:32.485 --> 08:34.976
because you could break your
neck on a floor like this.

08:34.977 --> 08:37.601
You know, I actually did
break my neck on this floor.

08:37.602 --> 08:38.863
Seriously?

08:38.864 --> 08:40.525
I had this huge fight with my wife.

08:40.525 --> 08:42.982
I got so upset, I slipped,
I fell down the stairs.

08:42.984 --> 08:44.378
(Neck cracks)

08:44.379 --> 08:46.704
Ooh. Oh, both ways.

08:46.705 --> 08:48.830
I didn't even get to finish the fight.

08:48.831 --> 08:53.017
Oh, that is classic unfinished
business you got there.

08:53.018 --> 08:56.572
Ohh. What was the fight
about? Anything juicy?

08:56.573 --> 08:59.263
Honestly? What color to paint the kitchen.

08:59.264 --> 09:01.655
Say, what if I were to
help you win that fight

09:01.656 --> 09:04.411
by painting the kitchen
whatever color you wanted?

09:04.412 --> 09:06.372
- Far out.
- It is far out.

09:06.373 --> 09:08.765
All right.

09:08.766 --> 09:10.725
No. No, you...

09:10.726 --> 09:12.719
I don't really get it, either.

09:13.783 --> 09:17.403
(Suspenseful theme playing)

09:17.404 --> 09:19.231
- Oh!
- Oh, geez!

09:19.232 --> 09:21.788
- What are you doing?
- Yo, I couldn't find a way out.

09:21.789 --> 09:23.549
But I found a screwdriver.

09:23.550 --> 09:26.141
Maybe I can, like, get the
door unhinged. What about you?

09:26.142 --> 09:27.370
Well, speaking of unhinged,

09:27.371 --> 09:29.630
I met the ghost. His name is Jack.

09:29.631 --> 09:32.652
He wants me to paint his
kitchen this color of cream.

09:32.653 --> 09:34.711
That sounds nice. Is he reasonable?

09:34.712 --> 09:38.133
No, if I'm being totally honest.
He's a bit of a loose canyon.

09:38.134 --> 09:41.190
You mean, cannon. Like Nick, right?

09:41.191 --> 09:43.217
No. Like the grand.

09:43.218 --> 09:45.077
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

09:45.078 --> 09:48.332
Loose canyon. Any moment the
rocks could just give way...

09:48.333 --> 09:49.529
- rocks?
- Like a Cannon.

09:49.530 --> 09:51.224
Just, look, forget the cannon.

09:51.225 --> 09:52.685
You work on the kitchen,

09:52.686 --> 09:54.579
I'll go figure out how to
get this door unhinged.

09:54.580 --> 09:57.471
Deal. Excuse me.

10:00.129 --> 10:02.222
(Mysterious theme playing)

10:12.588 --> 10:14.681
(Sniffing)

10:17.471 --> 10:19.230
If you're gonna paint
the kitchen any color,

10:19.231 --> 10:20.561
it should be fuschia.

10:20.562 --> 10:23.982
Fuschia? Oh, you're the wife. Julep.

10:23.983 --> 10:25.344
You're the one who got Jack so upset

10:25.345 --> 10:27.137
he fell down the stairs, right?

10:27.138 --> 10:30.095
Is that what Jack told you?
He fell down because of me?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.890
Did he mention he only fell down the stairs

10:31.891 --> 10:33.517
after he stabbed me in the chest 47 times?

10:33.518 --> 10:36.873
What? No. He most certainly
did not mention that.

10:36.874 --> 10:41.159
Also, 47 times? That seems
really, like, unnecessary.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.886
The first few didn't take.

10:42.887 --> 10:45.776
Well, Julep, if I may be so bold,

10:45.777 --> 10:47.835
you don't look a stab wound over 20.

10:47.836 --> 10:50.395
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.112
Wanna sniff?

10:57.704 --> 10:59.897
(Child crying)

11:01.791 --> 11:03.185
What are you doing?

11:03.186 --> 11:05.677
I'm, uh, painting the kitchen fuschia.

11:05.678 --> 11:07.437
But that's Julep's choice.

11:07.438 --> 11:09.132
Yeah, well, I met her, okay?

11:09.133 --> 11:10.793
And she told me

11:10.794 --> 11:13.285
that you, like, stabbed
her in the chest 47 times.

11:13.286 --> 11:15.013
Is that what she told you? I stabbed her?

11:15.014 --> 11:16.772
- She did.
- Did she mention

11:16.773 --> 11:19.032
that I only stabbed her
after she tried to poison me?

11:19.033 --> 11:20.726
- No. What?
- Yup.

11:20.727 --> 11:22.820
The kitchen paint dispute
had reached a climax.

11:22.821 --> 11:25.045
She was so desperate to get rid of me

11:25.046 --> 11:27.140
that she poisoned my afterwork seltzer.

11:27.141 --> 11:30.062
My God. How did you know
that it was poisoned?

11:30.063 --> 11:32.255
It's just a feeling I
had, I mean, in my gut.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.248
Also, the seltzer was pretty brown.

11:34.249 --> 11:37.604
Okay, I got it. So you
snapped, you felt betrayed,

11:37.605 --> 11:40.661
you grabbed a knife and... a screwdriver.

11:40.662 --> 11:42.089
I was just trying to open a paint can.

11:42.090 --> 11:44.815
Wow, you guys are a couple of whack jobs.

11:44.816 --> 11:47.040
Okay, I'm gonna go and
paint that kitchen fuschia.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.497
- No way.
- Yes. Let me do it. It's temporary,

11:49.498 --> 11:51.590
so your wife will be happy
and move into her light. Okay?

11:51.591 --> 11:53.851
Then I'll go back and
paint it cream for you.

11:53.852 --> 11:56.908
Then you'll be happy. Then I can
get out of this godforsaken house,

11:56.909 --> 11:58.768
paint the town red with
Roofie, call it a night.

11:58.769 --> 12:00.196
- It's a win, win, win.
- What?

12:00.197 --> 12:02.024
- What?
- You've woken the beast.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.686
Uh-oh.

12:05.081 --> 12:08.534
- You were gonna lie to me?
- No, I...

12:08.535 --> 12:11.923
Yeah. Yes. Okay, I was
being shifty. I'm sorry.

12:11.924 --> 12:14.017
But, lady, you kind of forgot to mention

12:14.018 --> 12:15.811
that you were gonna poison your husband.

12:15.812 --> 12:18.635
If he had just painted the
kitchen fuschia like I asked,

12:18.636 --> 12:21.558
- none of this would've happened.
- Stop it with the fuschia.

12:21.559 --> 12:23.019
What are we, a band of circus performers?

12:23.020 --> 12:25.878
Oh, and beige is a much
more refined choice.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.638
It was not beige. Cream.

12:27.639 --> 12:29.464
What's the difference between the two?

12:29.465 --> 12:31.458
No difference. That's the
point. It's just cream.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.053
It doesn't need a fancy name.

12:33.054 --> 12:35.280
There is nothing remarkable about cream.

12:35.281 --> 12:38.967
It is the color of your mother's kitchen.

12:38.968 --> 12:40.628
My mother's kitchen?

12:40.629 --> 12:42.555
Your mother's looks like
a goddamned gypsy cart.

12:42.556 --> 12:46.244
Whoa. Okay, guys, hey, I'm
just gonna say from experience,

12:46.245 --> 12:48.469
let's leave the moms and the
gypsies out of this, okay?

12:48.470 --> 12:50.529
Let me tell you something
about fuschia, okay, Jack?

12:50.530 --> 12:54.747
Fuschia is spontaneous.
It's sexy. It's free.

12:54.748 --> 12:57.606
Fuschia is fine the first time you see it.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.599
But not when you come home,
and you have to have it

12:59.600 --> 13:03.187
assault your senses every day for 30 years!

13:03.188 --> 13:05.546
Unlike cream, who sits in the
corner at the cocktail party

13:05.547 --> 13:07.839
and makes no attempt at
conversation with anybody.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.766
Cream, you don't have to
explain to your friends.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.826
It's warm, it's safe. I like cream!

13:11.827 --> 13:14.482
Okay, let me make a little
suggestion, if I may.

13:14.483 --> 13:16.842
Robin's egg blue. Super hip right now.

13:16.843 --> 13:18.635
Both: Shut up!

13:18.636 --> 13:20.661
(Rumbling)

13:20.662 --> 13:24.616
Oh, my God. I just finished
my last seven years.

13:28.537 --> 13:31.758
(Mysterious theme playing)

13:31.759 --> 13:35.080
Okay, well, I am glad you two calmed down

13:35.081 --> 13:38.137
because you were breaking a lot
of stuff I was gonna scavenge.

13:38.138 --> 13:40.230
- What?
- So let's start. Ahem.

13:40.231 --> 13:43.752
I have a hunch that you guys
are having a problem moving on,

13:43.753 --> 13:46.110
because we need to fix this marriage,

13:46.111 --> 13:48.603
so why don't we try a
little role playing. Okay?

13:48.604 --> 13:49.998
I will be playing, obviously,

13:49.999 --> 13:51.526
the role of the marriage counselor.

13:51.527 --> 13:54.019
You two can play whatever
parts you want, you know?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.679
Pilot, veterinarian, lady plumber.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.471
Why don't we just play husband and wife?

13:58.472 --> 14:01.262
Oh, my God, that's a good
idea. Yes. Thank you for that.

14:01.263 --> 14:03.288
Actually, that would help
me a lot with my thing.

14:03.289 --> 14:05.514
You know, being a marriage counselor.

14:06.942 --> 14:09.569
(Child laughing)

14:11.129 --> 14:13.021
Hello, ghost?

14:13.022 --> 14:15.547
I'm trying real hard not
to be the scared black guy

14:15.548 --> 14:19.235
in a haunted house. Okay?

14:19.236 --> 14:21.329
(Suspenseful theme playing)

14:24.020 --> 14:26.578
(Child laughing)

14:34.983 --> 14:36.909
(Screaming)

14:40.299 --> 14:44.085
Okay. You two were obviously
very much in love at one point.

14:44.086 --> 14:46.875
- Let's start there.
- It was a long time ago.

14:46.876 --> 14:50.198
It was easier to be in love
back then. It was the '50s.

14:50.199 --> 14:52.058
- The McCarthy years.
- Kevin: Yeah.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.779
Something obviously kept you
guys together. What was that?

14:55.780 --> 14:58.936
The only thing that kept us
together, honestly, was Brianne.

14:58.937 --> 15:00.398
- Who?
- Our daughter.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.459
(Suspenseful theme playing)

15:06.279 --> 15:09.203
Rose petals?

15:12.692 --> 15:14.751
(Child screams) (Screams)

15:17.741 --> 15:19.136
Oh, yeah, right, your daughter.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.764
I did see the little girl's room before.

15:20.765 --> 15:22.559
You know, with all the dolls.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.614
She was no little girl.
She was 30 years old.

15:25.615 --> 15:27.109
30?

15:27.110 --> 15:28.870
She's (Bleep) 30?

15:28.871 --> 15:33.023
- She was a little eccentric.
- She was a weirdo.

15:33.024 --> 15:35.083
30 years old, didn't have a boyfriend.

15:35.084 --> 15:37.109
Spent all day inside,
playing with her dolls.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.804
She was shy.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.131
You never gave her a
chance to express herself.

15:41.132 --> 15:43.225
(Suspenseful theme playing)

15:59.934 --> 16:01.828
(Slurping)

16:01.829 --> 16:05.482
Can I just ask you something?
What do you mean, she was shy?

16:05.483 --> 16:06.811
- My wife killed her.
- What?

16:06.812 --> 16:08.140
Oh, that is not fair.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.967
She came home the night of the incident.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.061
She saw us dead, she called the cops...

16:12.062 --> 16:14.984
she tried to call the cops,
she could barely speak,

16:14.985 --> 16:17.676
she grabbed the first drink
she could find, the seltzer.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.332
- The one she...?
- With the poison in it?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.693
From when Julep tried to poison me earlier.

16:22.694 --> 16:26.513
Oh, yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, got it. Okay. Good.

16:26.514 --> 16:27.941
No, that's a really effed-up story.

16:27.942 --> 16:30.433
She's gotta be pretty pissed with you guys.

16:30.434 --> 16:32.494
(Roofie moaning)

16:32.495 --> 16:36.015
- What was that?
- Sounded like a man orgasming.

16:36.016 --> 16:37.676
Or it could be somebody dying.

16:37.677 --> 16:40.898
Roofie! Hey!

16:40.899 --> 16:43.658
(Mysterious theme playing)

16:45.751 --> 16:48.839
Roofie! Hey! Roofie!

16:48.840 --> 16:52.918
What the hell is going on, man?
I got this, like, ghost blowjob

16:53.426 --> 16:57.145
or handjob or energy job. I
don't know what's going on.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.806
It just got kind of weird.

16:58.807 --> 17:01.231
You're being held hostage
by a creepy ghost chick.

17:01.232 --> 17:04.553
What? Is she hot?

17:04.554 --> 17:06.480
Yeah.

17:06.481 --> 17:09.636
- Brianne, put that down.
- Right now, young lady.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.230
No, it's fine. He's my boyfriend.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.324
I just need to kill him
so he can, you know,

17:13.325 --> 17:14.586
see me and then we can be together.

17:14.587 --> 17:16.646
No, don't kill him.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.241
- What?
- He's not your boyfriend.

17:18.242 --> 17:20.268
You just met him.

17:20.269 --> 17:22.328
You think once he sees me,
he won't be interested?

17:22.329 --> 17:25.285
- What? No.
- You can't jump into something serious

17:25.286 --> 17:27.011
with someone you barely know.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.770
But I do know him. We were intimate.

17:29.771 --> 17:32.260
I'm just gonna jump in here
for a quick second and say that

17:32.261 --> 17:34.488
the rate I quoted you earlier
was for couples' counseling.

17:34.489 --> 17:36.648
This is technically family counseling now.

17:36.649 --> 17:38.441
So it's gonna... Brianne, listen.

17:38.442 --> 17:39.969
You don't wanna tie yourself down

17:39.970 --> 17:41.996
to the first guy you fall for.

17:41.997 --> 17:44.355
You'll regret it your entire afterlife.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.980
Your mother's right. Thirty years from now,

17:46.981 --> 17:50.135
you'll be trapped in a loveless marriage.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.095
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

17:52.096 --> 17:55.086
Because from my point of view,
it's just a bunch of silence,

17:55.087 --> 17:57.213
and I got this screwdriver pointing at me.

17:57.214 --> 17:59.902
What's going on is, a few minutes ago

17:59.903 --> 18:01.929
I was making real
progress with this couple,

18:01.930 --> 18:03.325
and now they're talking about

18:03.326 --> 18:05.485
being trapped in a loveless marriage.

18:05.486 --> 18:09.239
- What happened?
- Just tell them to get a divorce.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.299
- That's not an option.
- What would people say?

18:11.300 --> 18:13.225
They're concerned about
the social concussions

18:13.226 --> 18:14.522
of getting a divorce.

18:14.523 --> 18:16.582
I guess it wasn't as common back then.

18:16.583 --> 18:20.661
Tell them now it's less common
for people not to get a divorce.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.025
- Really?
- What?

18:23.026 --> 18:27.312
- Jack, I think I want a divorce.
- You do?

18:27.313 --> 18:29.738
I'm sorry. When we first met,

18:29.739 --> 18:31.298
you had just come back from the war

18:31.299 --> 18:33.989
and I looked at you as
this adventurous hero.

18:33.990 --> 18:37.346
You were the first woman I'd
seen in, like, three years.

18:37.347 --> 18:39.307
I guess it wasn't enough, was it?

18:40.834 --> 18:42.826
I'm sorry I tried to poison you.

18:42.827 --> 18:45.285
I'm sorry I stabbed you in
the chest a couple of times.

18:45.286 --> 18:46.747
Forty-seven times.

18:46.748 --> 18:48.377
- Forty-seven?
- Yeah.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.227
No hard feelings?

18:55.387 --> 18:58.145
(Upbeat theme playing)

19:02.197 --> 19:04.722
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, no, no, don't worry.

19:04.723 --> 19:06.881
I think it all goes to the same place.

19:06.882 --> 19:09.273
I mean, they didn't even say goodbye to me.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.333
- Oh.
- It makes sense.

19:11.334 --> 19:14.224
I'm 30, living at home, single.

19:14.225 --> 19:17.280
Again, maybe that was a
little weird back in the '80s,

19:17.281 --> 19:19.838
but nowadays that's pretty standard.

19:19.839 --> 19:21.167
Really?

19:21.168 --> 19:23.262
Yeah. Plus, you got this really cool...

19:24.523 --> 19:25.918
doll collection that you keep.

19:27.648 --> 19:30.272
And, uh, look at you. You're a catch.

19:37.047 --> 19:38.876
(Upbeat theme playing)

19:41.466 --> 19:44.090
Okay. They're gone. So...

19:44.091 --> 19:46.017
you okay?

19:46.018 --> 19:49.407
I don't know, man. I feel kind of violated.

19:49.408 --> 19:51.566
But, like, in a good way.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.460
Oh, yeah? What did it feel like?

19:53.461 --> 19:56.915
It was like having sex with a
jacuzzi jet with no jacuzzi.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.245
Nice.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.522
(Both groaning)

20:06.816 --> 20:08.642
Man. So happy to be out
of the haunted house.

20:08.643 --> 20:10.005
That place sucked.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.767
Too bad you didn't get
to scavenge anything.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.826
I wouldn't say I didn't get anything.

20:13.827 --> 20:15.523
I got this awesome viking helmet.

20:15.524 --> 20:18.046
- You came here with that.
- I did?

20:18.047 --> 20:19.838
What about you? You get anything?

20:19.839 --> 20:21.465
Nah, man, you know what? I'm done.

20:21.466 --> 20:23.422
This place got bad vibes. I'm out.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.878
Yeah? You got smart. Let's
get something to eat.

20:25.879 --> 20:27.339
All right.

20:27.340 --> 20:29.296
I'm gonna eat, like, 17 burritos.

20:29.297 --> 20:31.389
