"There comes a time

a fervent desire
to go somewhere

01:20.776 --> 01:23.039
<i>and dig for hidden treasure."</i>

01:23.170 --> 01:24.258
There it is.

01:26.477 --> 01:29.132
Okay,
so what's the plan now?

01:29.263 --> 01:31.047
What does the line
at the end of the book say?

01:31.178 --> 01:34.311
"The Widow Douglas invests
in the gold which Tom
and Huck found."

01:34.442 --> 01:35.747
So where'd they find it?

01:35.878 --> 01:38.315
McDougal's Cave.
It's like a mile from the river.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.188
Guys, that was great.
That will make
for a perfect intro.

01:41.318 --> 01:44.234
Let's go again.
Guys. Guys!

<i>"Sometimes the legend
of some riches comes</i>

so heavily wrapped
in folklore

01:50.458 --> 01:55.071
that you gotta scrape away
the edges to work out
what's honest to goodness

01:55.811 --> 01:57.769
and what's hogwash."

01:57.900 --> 02:01.164
<i>Many o' folk
have gone searchin'
for Tom Sawyer's gold before,</i>

02:01.295 --> 02:06.213
<i>but most all have lacked
the wit to match ol' Tom
and Mr. Twain.</i>

02:06.343 --> 02:08.302
Yeah, maybe Woody's right.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.391
We should go away
and think up a plan.

02:10.521 --> 02:13.742
Yeah, like really put a good
week's worth into planning it.

02:13.872 --> 02:14.960
All right.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.056
Please tell me that
was your stomach.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.667
I was hoping
it was yours.

02:28.060 --> 02:32.282
When I get to three,
run into the cave.
One, two...

02:32.413 --> 02:34.154
- Three!

02:34.284 --> 02:35.807
- Woody!

02:37.026 --> 02:39.724
This gold ol'
Tom Sawyer found,

02:39.855 --> 02:41.944
pirate gold it was.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.774
And which Mr. Twain
scribbled down about.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.734
Well, that treasure's
as real as the day is long.

02:51.910 --> 02:55.523
Now, what fills me
with such earthly
confidence in the matter?

02:57.220 --> 03:01.442
Simple, 'cause my great-grandpa
helped him hide it.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.607
<i>These folks
who go searching,</i>

04:19.737 --> 04:24.133
<i>well, the good ones
find reward enough

04:24.264 --> 04:26.744
<i>but there was one
who came close.</i>

04:30.008 --> 04:32.924
Oh!

04:33.055 --> 04:36.972
<i>Now, if you can believe it,

Oh, yeah.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.341
<i>There she is.</i>

04:58.994 --> 05:00.996
Right there.

05:01.126 --> 05:04.086
The reptilian carnivore
<i>mississippiensis</i>,

05:05.653 --> 05:06.828
better known as

05:07.829 --> 05:09.396
the American alligator.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.184
Okay.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.404
Couldn't have
bothered you anymore.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.538
Oh, God. Go away! Go away!

05:21.669 --> 05:25.455
Hey, snappy! How about you pick
on someone your own size?

05:28.893 --> 05:31.243
- Ow!

05:33.463 --> 05:34.856
Get out of here, darling.

05:34.986 --> 05:38.120
-  Ha-ha!

05:38.250 --> 05:40.949
How do you like that,
you scallywag!

05:41.079 --> 05:42.603
Picking on a little girl.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.083
I don't care
if this is your swamp.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.824
- You can talk?
- Hm!

05:46.955 --> 05:49.523
Hi. Eurydice B. Magillicuddy.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.395
However, you can call me
Mrs. Mac.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.136
Thanks for saving me.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.485
I was almost like...

05:55.616 --> 05:58.358
A goner?
Oh, all in a day's work!

05:58.488 --> 06:04.015
Now, where might one find
a hearty bowl
of calcium-rich liquid gold?

06:04.146 --> 06:07.497
<i>It's funny the companions
you pick up along life's road.</i>

06:07.628 --> 06:12.850
<i>Before long, they were
the most famous feline

06:12.981 --> 06:15.157
<i>in the entire universe.</i>

06:15.287 --> 06:17.855
<i>Well, entire world.</i>

06:17.986 --> 06:21.903
<i>That was until
this young'un came along</i>

06:22.033 --> 06:25.210
<i>and something in Aggy changed.</i>

06:25.341 --> 06:27.865
<i>She went from the most

You're gonna be late again!

06:34.176 --> 06:35.395
Antony...

06:35.525 --> 06:37.745
<i>And an overprotective one
at that.</i>

06:37.875 --> 06:40.922
<i>It weren't his fault.
Not really.</i>

06:41.052 --> 06:43.794
<i>If only they didn't make
those little plastic
building blocks</i>

06:43.925 --> 06:46.231
<i>so damned tasty

<i>Doctor told her to best keep
a closer eye on him
moving forward.</i>

07:02.900 --> 07:04.859
<i>And did she ever.</i>

07:24.182 --> 07:27.664
Have yourself a day
wherever you are.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.194
- Now, do you have your--
- I'm gonna be late.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.196
Then you should have
gotten up sooner.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.633
- Have you charged your phone
in case there's an emergency?
- Mom.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.417
- Yes.
- It's better safe than sorry.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.550
- Yes, Mom. I'm gonna be late.
- Okay. Drink.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.421
- What? What is this?
- Just drink it.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.467
- I gotta go.
- It's good for you.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.035
Gross.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.258
<i>She still thinks
I'm three years old.
I'm being suffocated.</i>

07:56.388 --> 07:58.565
Yeah, suffocated
by your mom.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.957
Yeah, that'd suck.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.787
Dude, really?
I'm baring my soul here.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.660
I mean, my mom never crossed
the entire Arabian desert

08:06.790 --> 08:08.966
on nothing but
a gallon of water.

08:09.097 --> 08:13.536
Just to get lost
at sea for 75 days
on an inflatable raft,

08:13.667 --> 08:16.583
fending off pirates at
every turn. I'm just saying.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.280
Yeah, well, don't.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.158
Hey, Ant, come on.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.511
It's gonna be
a boring party anyway.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.563
Mm, I love you,
Miss Armstrong.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.307
Damn, what the--

08:45.437 --> 08:47.004
Good morning,
sleeping beauty.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.658
Lay off me, Lennon.

08:51.835 --> 08:56.797
And here we have the rare beast,
the galactus stare-a-sarus.

08:56.927 --> 09:00.148
-  I'm sorry,
I wasn't, um...
- I'm just messing with you.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.457
Okay, you lot. Settle down.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.677
Sorry, I'm late.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.246
Traffic was a disaster.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.381
All right. Right, right, right.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.429
Good morning, class.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.736
Good morning,
Miss Armstrong.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.781
Good morning,
Antony's mom.

09:29.133 --> 09:35.096
Lennon, as we've previously
discussed, in this room,
I am Miss Armstrong.

09:35.226 --> 09:38.403
Perhaps you would like the hour
in detention to reflect on that.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.580
-  Ooh!

09:42.799 --> 09:44.671
Oh, do you need a sweater?
Are you cold?

09:44.801 --> 09:46.411
- No?
- No. Stop it.

09:47.543 --> 09:50.198
Right, onto the fun stuff.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.417
This semester's book report.

09:55.551 --> 09:59.642
No. No, no, I think
you'll really get a kick
out of this one.

09:59.773 --> 10:04.604
Now, this particular book
is written by a man who goes
by the name of Samuel Clemens.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.562
Nah, Mark Twain wrote that.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.433
That's a pseudonym,
his pen name.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.174
He named his pen?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.437
Like a stage name?

10:12.568 --> 10:15.266
Yeah, like Lennon's mom
has at the zoo.

10:15.397 --> 10:16.964
Bobo, the-- Ow!

10:17.094 --> 10:19.183
Do you want more detention?

10:19.314 --> 10:21.969
Yes, Lu, that's exactly right.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.710
And the reason
he chose that name

10:23.840 --> 10:26.408
is because it was the call
to the riverboat captains

10:26.538 --> 10:30.064
to let them know that
the water was deep enough
for them to travel through.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.501
"Land ho! Mark Twain, captain!"

10:32.632 --> 10:36.113
Uh, Miss Armstrong,
are you sure we should be
learning about this book?

10:36.244 --> 10:38.681
It has antiquated values.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.946
There's validity to that point.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.123
But the book can't be
dismissed outright.

10:46.689 --> 10:51.389
Now, this offers us
incredible insight
into America's troubled past.

10:52.303 --> 10:57.613
This is really a parable
on developing moral code
through loyalty and friendship,

10:57.744 --> 11:00.877
all while showing kids
how to have some damn fun.

11:01.008 --> 11:04.054
I want all of you
to go treasure hunting.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.534
Okay.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.797
Through the pages
of this wonderful book,

11:07.928 --> 11:10.757
and you tell me how you think
Tom Sawyer and his friends

11:10.887 --> 11:13.847
would survive
in our modern world. Okay?

11:14.412 --> 11:17.546
Pass that up.
I've paired you off
into groups of three.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.809
Hey, we're book report mates.

11:19.940 --> 11:23.944
Wow! Uh, I mean,
uh, good. Great.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.212
<i>Mr. Twain liked to say,</i>

11:31.342 --> 11:34.824
"Never let your schooling
interfere with your education."

11:34.955 --> 11:38.567
For, after all, the man
who does not read books

11:38.698 --> 11:41.657
has no advantage over the man
who cannot read them.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.749
If you have any questions,
just come up and see me.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.928
Hey, you wanna
hang out after class?

11:52.059 --> 11:53.538
- Yeah.
- Cool.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.976
We can go over who will do
what with the assignment.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.761
Oh, right.
Yeah, of course.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.067
Cool. Sweet. See you.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.548
Hey, Ant, I'll be out
in a minute, okay?

12:03.679 --> 12:04.724
Okay.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.643
Hey, Miss Armstrong.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.298
Oh, Woody,
do you have a question
about the assignment?

12:14.429 --> 12:17.084
No. Um, I, uh...

12:18.302 --> 12:19.782
I made you something.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.915
You...

12:22.045 --> 12:26.006
made me something, again.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.573
Um, that's very sweet.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.750
Oh, I-I was inspired
by that story you told us

12:30.880 --> 12:33.840
about the time you were lost
in the jungles of Malaysia.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.450
- Right. Yeah.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.937
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.983
Uh, that's very lovely.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.856
What is it?

12:50.073 --> 12:52.423
It-it lets you hear
what animals are thinking.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.861
I-I figured since Mrs. Mac
never leaves your side,

12:54.991 --> 12:57.254
it'd be cool to hear
what she's thinking.

12:57.385 --> 13:00.475
See, you just press
this button right here,
and then...

13:05.175 --> 13:06.263
Voila!

13:12.748 --> 13:16.491
Maybe she just doesn't have
a whole lot going on upstairs.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.929
But I will try again tonight
when I get home.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.583
So, thank you.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.022
Bye, Miss Armstrong.

13:28.285 --> 13:31.811
Get this ridiculous
thing off my head right now.

13:31.941 --> 13:36.032
And don't think I won't forget.
"Maybe she doesn't have
much going on upstairs."

13:36.163 --> 13:39.166
Some days I really think
I should have just let
that gator take you.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.863
Hush, you.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.344
Okay.
Onto the matter at hand.

13:43.474 --> 13:46.564
Ah, yes. The interview.
Are you ready?

13:46.695 --> 13:49.611
No. No, I, um,
I'm freaking out about it.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.656
Come on,
we did this last night.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.137
- What are you?
- I'm a tiger.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.226
- I can't hear you.
- I'm a tiger.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.575
And what does a tiger do?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.664
They devour their prey.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.057
And what are you
going to do?

14:01.188 --> 14:02.972
I'm going to devour my prey.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.191
So let's get to it.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.411
Okay.
I am a tiger.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.413
I'm a tiger.
I'm perfect for this job.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.503
I'm the only person
for this job.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.201
I'm gonna get this job.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.990
- Aggy.
- Hi.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.863
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course, Jenny.

14:23.993 --> 14:27.736
It's not every day
that you get to interview
for your dream job.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.174
Oh.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.047
Oh, I-- I've come across
too eager, haven't I?

14:34.177 --> 14:35.875
Oh, no, no, no, no. Um...

14:37.485 --> 14:40.575
Aggy, this is--
this is just awkward. Uh...

14:41.619 --> 14:46.450
The head of the natural
history position has,
um, it's been filled.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.062
Oh.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.979
Oh. Um...

14:53.936 --> 14:56.504
Was it-- was it something I did?

14:56.634 --> 15:00.116
No, no, no, no. I mean,
you're one of our
favorite teachers.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.988
It was sudden,
you know?

15:02.118 --> 15:04.991
And I mean, honestly,
I didn't even have much say.

15:05.121 --> 15:09.386
I've been practically
training my entire life
for this type of position.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.562
Oh, I know. I mean,
we all love hearing

15:11.693 --> 15:14.522
all the stories of your
youthful endeavors.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.654
It's just that, um...

15:16.785 --> 15:23.009
Well, someone applied that
has a more, just slightly
more recent résumé.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.271
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.750
Who?

15:32.540 --> 15:35.238
- Agatha.
- AJ.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.763
Oh, wait.
Oh, you two, you--
you know each other.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.113
- We do.
- We do. Yes.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.376
- Agatha used to be my...
- Acquaintance.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.682
What are you doing in town?

15:44.813 --> 15:47.990
Well, the school was in need
of a world-renowned explorer

15:48.121 --> 15:49.949
to head the natural
history department,

15:50.079 --> 15:54.779
and, uh, I was in between gigs
and thought, "What the hell?"

15:58.000 --> 15:59.784
Do you mind
if Jenny and I talk?

15:59.915 --> 16:01.308
Ooh, no, no, no.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.657
Go right ahead.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.228
Oh, we're gonna sit. Okay.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.015
Oh! Yeah, of course.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.061
Bye.

16:17.585 --> 16:22.503
I am 100 times
the scholar he is.
You do realize that.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.765
I know.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.986
Listen, the school board
notified us that due
to rezoning,

16:27.116 --> 16:29.118
we now have too many
schools in our district.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.991
And with cuts to funding,
they now have to close one.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.427
And we're at the top
of the list?

16:33.557 --> 16:35.733
- I mean--
- Yes, yes, we are.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.518
I mean, it's been
a rough few years.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.172
First COVID,
and now this.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.565
And so we need something
that will set us apart

16:41.696 --> 16:43.263
and elevate us in the eyes
of the school board.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.439
But my résumé would
run circles around his.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.658
But you haven't updated it
in over a decade.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.926
Aggy, we need someone
who is more of a risk-taker

16:55.057 --> 16:57.451
and can reinvigorate
the kids' interest,

16:57.581 --> 17:00.976
and we feel like having
AJ leading the history
department will do that.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.718
Really? Him?

17:04.414 --> 17:05.807
Look, I'm sorry.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.902
Oh! I'm just--

17:14.033 --> 17:16.209
Oh, Mr. Harrison.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.690
Oh, you have my full support
if you should even need it.

17:19.821 --> 17:23.477
And, you know, if you
find yourself abandoned
on the side of the road,

17:23.607 --> 17:26.262
just go ahead.
Give me a call.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.481
Not!

17:27.611 --> 17:30.092
- You...
- Aggy.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.833
We'll always have Morocco.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.104
<i>Everyone thinks
I'm a mommy's boy, even Lu.</i>

17:42.235 --> 17:44.193
I don't think
you're a mommy's boy.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.067
- Gee, thanks.
-  I gotta go.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.069
All right,
I'll see you, man.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
Catch you on
the flip side.

17:55.726 --> 18:00.122
Looky here.
It's Mommy Armstrong's
favorite student.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.429
And there's me,
the least favorite.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.170
You know, you should think
about paying the school rent,

18:04.300 --> 18:06.172
- given how much
you're in detention.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.566
Talking to me like that
takes some guts.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.699
How about you say
we take a closer look at 'em?

18:12.308 --> 18:13.309
Not today.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.314
You're dead meat, Armstrong!

18:18.445 --> 18:20.142
I'll be comin' for you.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.150
<i>Okay.</i>

18:28.281 --> 18:30.631
No, he's fine. He's fine.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.155
He's gonna be home.
He's gonna be home.
He's gonna be fine.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.462
Oh, my God. Ant.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.116
You're safe.
You worried me.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.508
Where were you?
Why didn't you call me?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.249
I'm 30 minutes late.
Just chill.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.643
No, I won't chill.
You worried me.

18:42.773 --> 18:46.995
Fine. I'm late because
the bozo you gave detention to
took it out on me.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.910
Okay. You don't
have to shout.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.782
I do need to shout, Mom,
because you don't listen.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.090
Why can't you just
let me be a normal kid?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.319
I can't do this anymore.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.236
I can't live with her watching
over me all the damn time.

19:37.524 --> 19:42.093
<i>Well, if you ask me,
no good can ever come
from running away from home.</i>

19:42.224 --> 19:47.011
<i>Just see for yourself
how that worked out
for ol' Tom and my Grandpa Joe.</i>

19:47.142 --> 19:50.276
<i>But it sure does make
for one hell of a story.</i>

20:23.744 --> 20:25.876
Stupid books everywhere.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.264
"To whomever should find this...

21:05.394 --> 21:10.399
My father's story lives forever
in the pages of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>."

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
Come on, boys,
we're owning them.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.928
Yeah!

21:25.066 --> 21:26.154
He ain't far.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.025
Come on.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.200
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

21:42.388 --> 21:45.347
<i>♪ Dip to the moonlight
Dip, dip ♪</i>

21:45.478 --> 21:47.044
<i>♪ Dip ♪</i>

21:48.045 --> 21:51.440
<i>♪ Three for you ♪</i>

21:51.571 --> 21:54.530

<i>♪ My three... ♪</i>

22:13.897 --> 22:15.769
Hand it over, Sawyer.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.815
What's in it for me if I do?

22:18.946 --> 22:20.904
- I'll let you live.
-  Yeah.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.646
You can work a double shift,
digging me gold.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.170
That ain't no deal.
I want in on.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.737
No!

22:30.784 --> 22:32.307
What do you want?

22:32.438 --> 22:35.136
Enough to set up my family.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.878
Let us live peaceably.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.749
The rest is yours.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.795
-  Ow.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.971
You idiot!

22:54.982 --> 22:56.810
Tom Sawyer.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.900
Tell your Aunt Polly,

23:00.030 --> 23:01.684
Angus sent you.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.083
What's so funny?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.304
That ain't the real map.

23:16.917 --> 23:20.399
Being rich isn't what all
its cracked up to me.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.097
But then,

23:24.751 --> 23:26.492
you'll never find out.

23:33.020 --> 23:36.023
No! You idiots!

23:37.851 --> 23:38.982
Damn it!

23:43.900 --> 23:45.511
Okay.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.863
So, what's this thing that's
so important, it couldn't
have waited until tomorrow?

23:50.603 --> 23:52.866
- It was real.
- What?

23:58.915 --> 24:02.136
"Mr. Twain recorded it
most exactly as it occurred.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.051
The only thing
he omitted was..."

24:04.834 --> 24:06.532
Where's the rest of it?

24:06.662 --> 24:08.055
No. It's just signed.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.579
Mary Sawyer,
Hannibal, 1923.

24:10.710 --> 24:14.104
"Most of the adventures
recorded in this book
really occurred.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.455
One or two were
experiences of my own.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.892
The rest, those
of classmates of mine."

24:19.458 --> 24:20.459
Now, check this.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.856
"The real Tom Sawyer
and Twain were friends
in San Francisco.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.816
Twain told Sawyer,
'I'm going to write
a book about a boy.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.210
Just such a boy
as you must have been.'"

24:33.950 --> 24:35.952
The-the character's
based on a real person.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.606
Plenty are. So what?

24:37.737 --> 24:39.826
So, if it's based
on a real person,

24:39.956 --> 24:42.219
then maybe the events are
based on real events, too.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.221
They discovered
pirates' gold.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.223
Okay, $12,000 of it.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.444
- Is that all?
- That was in 1876.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.274
With inflation, that's like
two million dollars,
give or take.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.493
Whoa.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.104
But-- but do you guys think

24:57.234 --> 25:01.195
that this is actually
some real-life journal
of what actually happened?

25:01.325 --> 25:04.677
Listen, this could be,
like, our one time
to do something great.

25:04.807 --> 25:08.202
Like historically huge,
and finally have
people respect us.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.247
What if people find out?

25:10.378 --> 25:13.076
They'll fall over
themselves laughing at us.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.731
They already laugh
at us, Wood.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.820
For two million bucks,
they can do whatever
they like.

25:17.951 --> 25:22.042
Think of all the shiny,
new inventing equipment
you could snap up with that.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.088
I bet my mom would
be mad impressed
with us as well.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.482
Hmm.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.051
But where would
we even start?

25:31.181 --> 25:34.097
- Uh, the letter said
"Hannibal", right?
- Yeah.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.405
That's the town Twain based
St. Petersburg on.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.189
And it's just
one county over.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.241
- Come on, man.
Come on, Woody.
- Come on, Woodster.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.851
Come on. I know,
I can see it in your face.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.461
- Let's do it.
- Woodster!

25:50.592 --> 25:52.333
Let's find
Tom Sawyer's gold.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.770
- All right!
- Yay!

25:54.901 --> 25:58.948
<i>And that's what led
to these young'uns being
in this here predicament.</i>

26:00.820 --> 26:02.169
- Oh! Flashlight.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.047
All right. Everybody,
keep your eyes peeled

26:11.178 --> 26:13.267
in case those wolves
follow us in here.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.923
What are we
even looking for?

26:18.185 --> 26:22.450
Right. The book said
the treasure is two miles
into the cave.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.060
Oh, look.
There it is.

26:26.715 --> 26:27.760
What?

26:27.890 --> 26:29.675
Guys, we're gonna
be billionaires.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.502
This is so much more
than I imagined.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.680
Oh. Ant, what are you
gonna do with your share?

26:34.810 --> 26:37.421
I'm gonna get my own TV
and my own house.

26:37.987 --> 26:40.555
And probably a TV
in each room. Maybe three.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.645
Why not four
and five houses?

26:43.776 --> 26:45.691
Can you guys believe
it was that easy?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.997
- Luxury suits you, Lu.
- Whoa.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.260
Thank you.
One does try.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.133
The hell are you kids
doing in here?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.614
Uh, it-it's ours.
Finders keepers.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.443
Okay, you can have this.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.971
-  Huh?

27:07.060 --> 27:09.366
Ugh. It's an
amusement park?

27:09.497 --> 27:12.239
State park.
And you're trespassing.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.981
I told you guys
it wasn't real.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.901
<i>Now, as I said,</i>

27:22.031 --> 27:26.688
Tom and Mr. Twain would
never have made it easy as pie
for just anyone to find.

27:26.819 --> 27:30.692
Mr. Twain himself was just
about as wise as four folks
all smashed together himself.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.738
So it was gonna take
about that many, at least,

27:32.868 --> 27:36.698
<i>if anyone was ever
gonna unravel
the mystery of Tom's gold.</i>

27:40.702 --> 27:44.967
Generation after generation
has tried but failed,

27:45.098 --> 27:47.187
searching for
our family fortune.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.580
Tch. Always coming up short.

27:49.711 --> 27:54.977
Until I, AJ Harrison,
discovered

27:55.108 --> 28:00.374
that my protégé,
a woman who I taught
everything that I know,

28:00.504 --> 28:04.247
possesses the letter
that's gonna give me
everything that I want.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.728
Well...

28:10.297 --> 28:12.691
There ain't gonna be
no stopping me this time.

28:18.784 --> 28:19.872
Lennon!

28:22.178 --> 28:23.919
What now, Uncle AJ?

28:26.226 --> 28:28.881
How would you like
to become...

28:29.011 --> 28:30.447
...really rich?

28:50.903 --> 28:53.514
Gotta give you points
for adventurous spirit.

28:54.297 --> 28:57.213
Got a nephew about your age,
can't get him off the computer,

28:57.344 --> 29:00.347
let alone travel in the dead
of the night to hunt treasure.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.610
What's gonna happen to us?

29:02.741 --> 29:08.659
Well, last lot of kids
who went looking for my
great-great-grandpa's gold,

29:08.790 --> 29:11.227
ended up doing 20 to life
in Leavenworth.

29:19.409 --> 29:23.587
Well, I think we can
overlook the criminal
charge this one time. Hm?

29:28.070 --> 29:32.292
So, wait, you said, "your
great-great-grandpa's gold"?

29:32.422 --> 29:34.990
Indeed. Tom Sawyer.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.471
That handsome fellow
on the left right there.

29:37.601 --> 29:38.559
What?

29:38.689 --> 29:41.692
He was my granddad's grandpa.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.608
Look, I don't
blame you, kids.

29:44.739 --> 29:48.090
Plenty of folks
from far and wide
have gone searching for it.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.006
I took a shot
at it myself once.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.443
So you think
it's real, right?

29:53.574 --> 29:57.796
Hmm. Well, it's a wonderful
tale to excite kids,

29:57.926 --> 29:59.623
but it's just that.

29:59.754 --> 30:00.886
A tale.

30:02.801 --> 30:07.501
Alrighty. Who's drawing
the short straw and have me
call their parents first?

30:09.024 --> 30:10.460
Yes?

30:10.591 --> 30:12.636
- Can you spare a moment?
- Sure.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.814
Sit tight.
You're gonna be all right.

30:25.345 --> 30:29.697
I told you, guys, we were
gonna get in trouble, and--

30:34.528 --> 30:36.704
So you were real,
Tom Sawyer.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.750
That's insane.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.274
The three amigos.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.845
"MDCCCLXV.

30:47.671 --> 30:51.545
I mean, I know it's not
the Wi-Fi password,
but, like, what is that?

30:51.675 --> 30:54.026
That's the year, 1865.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.987
They wasted a lot of space
writing it like that, right?

31:01.076 --> 31:04.601
You guys, we've been going
about this all wrong.

31:05.472 --> 31:10.129
Twain wouldn't make it so easy
that the treasure is exactly
where it's supposed to be.

31:10.259 --> 31:13.697
"Under the cross." We've been
thinking about the cross
like a crucifix.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.004
So what do you
think it is?

31:16.962 --> 31:18.920
"Under the cross."

31:20.704 --> 31:23.229
You guys, Chapter X.

31:23.359 --> 31:24.970
It's the one in the tannery.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.493
You guys, this is
our first hot lead.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.321
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

31:28.451 --> 31:31.237
What do you suggest we do?
Just stroll on out of here?

31:31.367 --> 31:32.803
Uh... Hm.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.068
No. We go out the back door.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.767
Come on, hurry. Go!

31:39.898 --> 31:41.421
- The-- But--
- Shh!

31:41.551 --> 31:43.684
Go! Woody, let's go!

31:43.814 --> 31:45.686
Hah. And now we're fugitives.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.739
Be careful, you idiot.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.959
There's nothing but
a bunch of junk up here.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.701
<i>Look harder.
It's gonna be leather-bound.</i>

32:00.831 --> 32:04.357
It's gonna be yellowed,
aged, stitched with a binder.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.315
<i>It's gonna have lots of pages.</i>

32:06.446 --> 32:08.883
I know what a book
looks like, Uncle AJ.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.343
Lennon?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.219
Hello?

32:40.349 --> 32:42.482
Miss Armstrong?
This is Detective Thatcher.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.137
Firstly, don't worry,
they're fine.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.922
<i>But you'll have
to come to Hannibal
to collect your son.</i>

32:48.053 --> 32:49.097
My son?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.752
No, no, my son's in bed.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.624
No, actually,
they went exploring.

32:54.755 --> 32:57.149
Something about an
assignment you gave them?

32:57.279 --> 32:58.280
What?

33:00.935 --> 33:02.110
Hannibal?

33:02.241 --> 33:04.895
How did they even
get that far? Okay.

33:05.026 --> 33:06.767
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.204
Oh, crap.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.250
I think these suckers
beat us to the punch.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.513
Okay, get out of there.
Abort mission.

33:13.643 --> 33:14.862
<i>Get out of there.</i>

33:18.866 --> 33:20.389
Okay,
we'll see you soon.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.522
Yes, I will keep an eye on them.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.010
Great.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.330
-  It's clear.
- Um...

33:48.461 --> 33:50.767
Oh, the only one I found
is the old Mitchell Tannery.

33:50.898 --> 33:52.987
It says it closed
in 1984, though.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.597
- It's seven blocks away.
- That's where we start.

33:54.728 --> 33:55.772
- Okay.
- Let's go.

33:58.036 --> 34:04.216
<i>What about
a personal security guard
to monitor him 24 hours a day?</i>

34:04.346 --> 34:06.609
You should have taken
that turn back there.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.961
Cat, I remember every single
road, alley, underpass, and
freeway I have ever been on.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.659
I know the way.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.183
When I get
my hands on him...

34:15.314 --> 34:17.055
Well, for someone
with a photographic memory,

34:17.185 --> 34:21.189
it seems to have slipped
your mind what you were like
at his age.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.584
My arms are getting tired.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.110
Here.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.637
"He picked up
a clean pine shingle

35:17.767 --> 35:19.682
that laid in the moonlight.

35:20.466 --> 35:23.382
They buried the shingle
close to the wall."

35:24.383 --> 35:25.384
Here.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.429
It can't be
in here.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.998
It's got to be like an
outside wall then, right?

35:31.912 --> 35:33.522
I saw some shovels coming in.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.395
Grab them quietly.
Now, let's go.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.485
Let's get digging.

35:49.495 --> 35:51.279
- Ant!
- Sorry.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.330
Detective Thatcher?

35:58.460 --> 36:00.201
I'm looking
for Detective Thatcher.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.900
- Hi.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.467
Hi.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.643
Uh, Agatha. Aggy.
Antony's mom.

36:07.774 --> 36:08.905
Yes.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.996
So, uh, did you have
a good drive?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.869
It was fine.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.132
Well, come with me.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.482
- I have a little update
on the kids.
- Oh, okay.

36:27.663 --> 36:28.708
What?

36:44.811 --> 36:45.986
I can't find anything.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.467
This is a waste of time.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.033
All night for...

36:50.860 --> 36:52.775
- ...nothing.
- Wait.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.476
They said they found
the treasure under the X.

36:57.606 --> 37:00.566
Under the X
is Chapter Nine.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.611
Okay, so where are they
in that chapter?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.135
It's the one
in the graveyard.

37:07.747 --> 37:08.965
Come on.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.579
Guess we're going
to a graveyard.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.060
I hate graveyards.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.545
<i>♪ Dip, dip, dip ♪</i>

37:23.676 --> 37:25.504
<i>♪ Three for you ♪</i>

37:25.634 --> 37:26.679
<i>♪ And five for me ♪</i>

37:26.809 --> 37:29.725
Is now really
the time for karaoke?

37:29.856 --> 37:31.597
Sorry. Habit.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.991
I always do it
when I'm worried.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.690
<i>Thatcher, we've got
a break in at the tannery.</i>

37:37.820 --> 37:40.214
<i>Three minors spotted. Over.</i>

37:40.345 --> 37:42.172
Thatcher's responding.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.362
Let's just
do this quick, okay?

37:57.492 --> 38:00.843
Tom said, "Huck, do you
reckon Hoss Williams
hears us talking?"

38:00.974 --> 38:02.367
That's who we're looking for.

38:02.497 --> 38:03.759
Okay, then let's split up.

38:03.890 --> 38:04.978
Call out if you
find something.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.023
- All right.
- Okay.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.982
<i>Come on out, guys.</i>

38:09.112 --> 38:10.723
You're not in trouble.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.900
Antony!

38:16.468 --> 38:17.904
Freshly dug right here.

38:28.784 --> 38:29.872
This is his.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.484
Why is it here?

38:32.614 --> 38:34.703
They said something about
an assignment you gave 'em.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.792
On <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.838
Wait.

38:39.882 --> 38:44.017
Tom and Huck buried a pine
shingle at an old tannery
after they witnessed a murder.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.194
Is there a graveyard nearby?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.718
Hannibal Graveyard.
Oldest around.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.112
Then that's where
they are. Let's go.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.306
Hey, come look.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.313
I mean, it's close.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.706
Do you think they're related?

39:21.794 --> 39:24.753
There must be some clues
around here somewhere.

39:29.497 --> 39:30.933
Wait, the--

39:32.805 --> 39:33.849
That's weird.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.765
- What-- Whoa! Whoa! Woody!

39:36.896 --> 39:38.767
No! Whoa.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.248
- Huh? What the--
- Ah!

39:41.379 --> 39:43.555
I think I'm ready
to go home now.

39:43.685 --> 39:44.991
Sorry, Mary.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.863
I told you, guys,
this was a dumb idea.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.952
You guys said,
"Oh, we'll find treasure."

39:50.083 --> 39:53.173
All we've done
is get arrested
and find a skull.

39:54.522 --> 39:57.133
How am I gonna explain
this to my mom?

39:57.264 --> 39:58.787
At least we tried.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.141
I just wanna go home.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.406
I--

40:08.536 --> 40:11.409
Dude, wait, really?

40:11.539 --> 40:12.540
Sorry.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.370
You too? Come on,
guys, seriously?

40:21.723 --> 40:22.811
Hey, wait.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.336
It-it's a--
It's a puzzle.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.126
Guys, we have
to give this up.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.084
We're in enough
trouble as it is.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.086
It's not

40:38.044 --> 40:40.133
Hoss Williams.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.311
It's "Who is...

40:44.442 --> 40:45.747
someone".

40:47.009 --> 40:48.576
Wait, letter mix.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.535
- Yeah.
- Take the S,

40:50.665 --> 40:53.799
and put it in front
of the A and the M. It's "Sam".

40:54.756 --> 40:56.454
And the other S makes "Sill".

40:57.237 --> 40:58.978
"Sam Sill"?

41:00.066 --> 41:01.720
It is real.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.548
So that's it.
"Who is Sam Sill?"

41:03.678 --> 41:05.724
All right, let's go
find Sam Sill then.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.640
- Okay, let's go.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.293
<i>Well, what do you know?</i>

41:10.424 --> 41:13.209
They've gone and done what
no one's ever done before.

41:13.340 --> 41:16.952
Solve the first riddle
of ol' Tom's mystery.

41:25.395 --> 41:27.615
Guys, found him. Over here.

41:29.704 --> 41:31.358
- Sam Sill.
- Nice, dude.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.752
- Whoa! What--

41:35.449 --> 41:36.450
No way.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.234
- Is that the--
- The map.

41:40.193 --> 41:41.673
Do you guys know
what this means?

41:41.803 --> 41:44.414
It means you all
are in huge trouble.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.286
- Hi, Miss Armstrong.
- Hey, Mom.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.549
It would take the remainder
of your teenage years
to blueprint

41:48.680 --> 41:50.595
just how much trouble
you lot are in.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.206
- But, Mom, we have to--
- Antony Auggie Armstrong.

41:53.336 --> 41:56.644
You are so grounded
that your clothes
will be back in fashion

41:56.775 --> 41:58.777
by the time your punishment
is even over.

41:59.691 --> 42:01.997
- Let's go. Now.
- Detective, can you
explain it to her?

42:02.128 --> 42:04.347
- Can you help us out?
- Sorry, guys, I'd love to help.

42:04.478 --> 42:05.871
But as you ran out on me,

42:06.001 --> 42:07.916
it's time to face the music.

42:08.047 --> 42:10.136
- But, Mom, we--
- Now, Antony.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.793
Miss Armstrong,
we're so close.

42:14.923 --> 42:17.622
- Don't you get that it's real?
- Seriously, we were so close.

42:19.145 --> 42:20.320
I knew it.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.152
Hey. Hey, Buttons.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.808
Yeah, I'm thinking of getting
the band back together.

42:30.983 --> 42:34.639
You think you can pull another
Alabama coat hanger for me?

42:38.033 --> 42:41.994
I cannot
believe you would be
so irresponsible, Antony.

42:42.124 --> 42:44.997
But we have proof that the gold
and Tom Sawyer is real.

42:45.127 --> 42:47.477
- Look, we found this map.

42:47.608 --> 42:49.958
No, that is just
a worthless old scroll.

42:50.089 --> 42:51.917
You never believe me.

42:52.047 --> 42:55.660
Do you have any idea
how many wild goose chases
I've been sent on

42:55.790 --> 42:57.879
because of a stupid map? No.

42:58.010 --> 43:01.535
No, none of you have any clue
how dangerous it can really be.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.668
How would I
ever get to know?

43:03.798 --> 43:07.410
I mean, you took a job
at my school to watch over me
every second of the day.

43:07.541 --> 43:08.629
I did not.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.588
I like teaching.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.154
You hate teaching.

43:12.285 --> 43:14.417
You love adventure.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.245
I mean, at least you used to

43:16.376 --> 43:18.247
before you had me,

43:18.378 --> 43:20.380
before you scared Dad away.

43:24.123 --> 43:27.387
Now I have an overprotective
mother and an absent father,

43:27.517 --> 43:29.302
and neither of us
have fun ever.

43:30.433 --> 43:32.174
It's because
I love you, okay?

43:33.262 --> 43:35.438
Then I'd hate to see
how you'd be if you hated me.

43:39.399 --> 43:41.444
You dropped this,
by the way.

43:43.011 --> 43:44.491
Why did you
even take that?

43:46.798 --> 43:48.538
Because I was...

43:50.236 --> 43:54.632
going to find the gold and then
run away to Utah to find Dad.

43:57.286 --> 43:59.854
Ant, your father...

44:03.075 --> 44:04.946
He's a door
best left unopened.

44:07.253 --> 44:08.907
Well, he can't be
any worse than you.

44:27.490 --> 44:31.625
He hates me.
Ant just hates me.
He just-- He hates me.

44:32.844 --> 44:34.367
Your mom's really
talking to herself.

44:36.804 --> 44:38.676
He's just hot under the collar.

44:38.806 --> 44:41.069
But I can't say I blame him.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.856
You know, you'll always
catch more flies with honey
than vinegar.

44:44.986 --> 44:46.118
- Hm.

44:56.215 --> 44:57.782
Damn it.

44:57.999 --> 45:00.959
Ugh, I left the house
in such a hurry,
I forgot my purse.

45:02.482 --> 45:04.353
I need to borrow
your debit card.

45:04.484 --> 45:06.486
I will pay you back
when we get home.

45:08.009 --> 45:09.010
Thank you.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.379
He's proud of me.

45:34.601 --> 45:37.343
<i>They say once you have
that lust for adventure,</i>

45:37.473 --> 45:39.127
it never-- well,
never truly dies.

45:39.258 --> 45:41.782
It lives on inside
of you, dormant,

45:41.913 --> 45:45.525
waiting for that moment
to snatch you back into it.

45:45.655 --> 45:50.617
It's a feeling almost
as pervasive as a mother
not wanting to let her son down.

45:52.184 --> 45:53.272
<i>Almost.</i>

45:57.580 --> 46:00.583
Oh, if-- if we do this...

46:03.804 --> 46:06.459
You took me hostage,
and we are back home
in 24 hours.

46:06.589 --> 46:07.765
- Okay?

46:07.895 --> 46:09.723
- Okay. All right, Mom.
-  Let's go!

46:09.854 --> 46:13.335
It's time I took
the road less traveled again.

46:15.511 --> 46:18.950
All right, buckle up.
It's gonna be a wild ride.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.735
Okay, seriously though,
buckle up. Safety first.

46:31.571 --> 46:34.356
Everyone, act natural,
pretend like I'm not even here.

46:37.969 --> 46:40.275
Ugh. Just put that
away already.

46:40.406 --> 46:42.234
Stupid moths
have eaten half of it.

46:42.364 --> 46:45.803
And half the words are missing.
Nothing here makes sense.

46:46.412 --> 46:52.244
"Dip, dip, dip, if,
nor, bring the..."

46:52.374 --> 46:54.768
The words are so small,
I can't make it out.

46:55.595 --> 46:57.118
I may have just the thing.

47:02.776 --> 47:08.173
Aw, hey, kitty-cat.
Do you wanna learn
how to talky-talk like a person?

47:08.303 --> 47:09.696
- Oh, yes, you do.
- Oh...

47:09.827 --> 47:11.219
- I'm gonna give it
one more try.
- Woody--

47:11.350 --> 47:13.265
- Let's see.
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

47:14.048 --> 47:16.529
What the--
I-I didn't put that on yet.

47:16.659 --> 47:17.878
Oh, Mom.

47:18.009 --> 47:19.880
I guess the cat's
out of the bag now.

47:20.011 --> 47:22.230
It would be
a cataclysmic catastrophe

47:22.361 --> 47:25.973
to categorically succumb
to the catalytically
catatonic states

47:26.104 --> 47:28.149
of which you currently cater.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.543
- Huh?
- I gotta get this.

47:30.673 --> 47:32.762
Oh, man, this scene could
use a little more light.

47:32.893 --> 47:34.852
That's okay.
We'll roll with it.

47:34.982 --> 47:38.116
I just want, like, a relaxed
performance from everyone.

47:38.246 --> 47:40.205
Okay? And action.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.425
No, you're not filming me.
I'm going back to my trailer.

47:48.126 --> 47:49.649
Why not?

47:49.867 --> 47:52.695
Hey, all this time and you never
told me Mrs. Mac could talk?

47:53.827 --> 47:55.176
I-I'm...

47:56.090 --> 47:59.746
I guess there's one
or two things I haven't
quite told you about yet.

48:04.969 --> 48:07.536
And I'm assuming that's been
here my entire life, too.

48:08.450 --> 48:09.669
Where's the spare tire?

48:09.799 --> 48:11.279
I don't know, man.

48:11.410 --> 48:14.326
- Okay. Get the map out.
- Okay.

48:18.112 --> 48:21.507
"In Allister's Cove,
the second shall be...

48:21.637 --> 48:24.771
Solve the puzzles there laid,
and look within to see."

48:24.902 --> 48:26.251
It's only accessible
through the bayou.

48:26.381 --> 48:27.992
It's about five miles
down the road.

48:28.209 --> 48:30.951
Pack up the map.
Woody, grab what you can
from the kit. And, Lu?

48:31.691 --> 48:32.997
Keep filming.

48:33.127 --> 48:34.259
You got it.

48:35.477 --> 48:36.609
Okay, let's go.

48:41.527 --> 48:43.311
- Uh...
- Hi.

48:44.704 --> 48:45.792
It's fine.

48:47.141 --> 48:49.796
- Hi.
- Ah, car trouble?

48:49.927 --> 48:51.929
Oh, no.
No, we're fine. We--

48:52.059 --> 48:54.453
It's just a pit stop,
but we're moving
along now, so...

48:54.583 --> 48:56.542
Yeah, whoa, whoa,
whoa there, Missy, uh...

48:57.195 --> 48:59.458
You can't stop on
the side of the road.

49:00.328 --> 49:01.634
Not in this town.

49:01.764 --> 49:03.853
Oh, okay, I'm--
I'm sorry. I didn't--

49:03.984 --> 49:07.814
I didn't know what the rules
in this district were,
but it won't happen again.

49:07.945 --> 49:11.426
Oh, you wouldn't be
on a treasure hunt now,
would you?

49:12.688 --> 49:15.561
No. No, we're going home.

49:16.779 --> 49:18.477
- Kids?
- The map.

49:19.695 --> 49:21.828
- Uh-huh. Map?
-  Uh...

49:21.959 --> 49:23.743
- What map?
- Oh, hmm.

49:23.873 --> 49:26.006
Wise girl, huh?
Hand it over now.

49:26.137 --> 49:28.052
- Mom.
- Give it to him,
give it to him.

49:28.878 --> 49:29.967
No, don't.

49:34.841 --> 49:37.235
Pick it up.
I ain't playing, kid.

49:43.328 --> 49:44.546
- Run!
- Go!

49:44.677 --> 49:45.634
- Go, go!
- Go!

49:45.765 --> 49:46.853
Ugh!

49:49.073 --> 49:50.726
That's not mud!

49:53.773 --> 49:54.817
Run!

49:54.948 --> 49:57.298
-  Go! Go.

49:57.907 --> 49:59.605
- Whoa.

49:59.735 --> 50:00.867
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

50:00.998 --> 50:02.260
- Is he following us?
- Keep going.

50:02.390 --> 50:04.305
This way. This way.
Don't look back.

50:04.436 --> 50:06.090
- Just keep going.

50:11.095 --> 50:12.226
Brats.

50:14.098 --> 50:17.101
Excellent work, my old pal.

50:17.231 --> 50:19.103
You just earned
your 20 percent.

50:19.233 --> 50:21.235
- Hey, what about me?
- Shut up, Lennon.

50:21.366 --> 50:23.716
A chance to get that turd back
will sweeten the deal.

50:23.846 --> 50:26.197
Oh, you're gonna get it.
And then some.

50:28.199 --> 50:29.548
It's in Allister's Cove.

50:30.331 --> 50:32.899
Allister's Cove. All right.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.772
That means
we're gonna go up
and around the bayou.

50:37.382 --> 50:39.906
Then let's move.
Let's move.

50:40.037 --> 50:42.169
Hey, can you carry
some, Uncle AJ?

50:42.300 --> 50:45.390
Lennon, I'm carrying the map.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.869
- Do you wanna be rich?
- Yeah.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.089
You consider yourself
an athlete?

50:49.220 --> 50:50.395
Then let's move.

50:53.789 --> 50:55.400
- Okay.

50:56.401 --> 50:57.663
I think we're clear.

50:58.968 --> 50:59.969
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

51:00.100 --> 51:03.016
Are you okay, bud?

51:04.278 --> 51:06.411
Sorry, guys, we--
we lost the map.

51:07.020 --> 51:11.242
That's okay, because we have
a budding filmmaker
who got it all on tape.

51:11.372 --> 51:13.766
I was actually just getting
you guys' close-up shots.

51:13.896 --> 51:15.985
I was gonna get
a pickup shot
of the map later.

51:16.116 --> 51:17.987
Well, that's that.
We're done.

51:18.118 --> 51:20.773
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

51:20.903 --> 51:23.863
Look, when I was your age,
I was running all over the place

51:23.993 --> 51:26.083
chasing after
all sorts of things.

51:26.213 --> 51:29.695
But you guys have gotten closer
than anyone ever has with this.

51:29.825 --> 51:30.957
We're gonna see this through.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.915
We're gonna keep
doing this, okay?

51:33.046 --> 51:34.134
But how?

51:35.875 --> 51:37.790
Hand me a pen and paper
from the kit.

51:40.923 --> 51:43.578
An elephant never forgets.

51:44.449 --> 51:47.016
So either I'm part elephant
or it's very fortuitous

51:47.147 --> 51:49.802
that you have a chaperone
who has photographic memory.

51:50.977 --> 51:52.544
- No way.
- Whoa. Whoa.

51:52.674 --> 51:54.894
And why didn't you
tell me any of this?

51:55.503 --> 51:57.723
Must have slipped
my mind.

51:57.853 --> 52:00.378
That's funny, Mom. Not.

52:00.508 --> 52:03.032
So you remember everything?

52:04.512 --> 52:05.600
Everything.

52:06.384 --> 52:07.733
Whoa.

52:10.170 --> 52:13.391
Okay. So it looks like we
have to go through the river.

52:13.521 --> 52:14.957
It's a couple of miles
down that way,

52:15.088 --> 52:16.872
so we got to keep going.

52:17.003 --> 52:18.700
- All right?
- Let's go.

52:18.831 --> 52:20.006
Let's do this.

52:24.619 --> 52:26.926
<i>I think we're going
the right way.</i>

52:27.535 --> 52:29.363
At least we're finally
in the clear, right?

52:32.061 --> 52:33.280
Why did you have
to say that out loud?

52:33.411 --> 52:34.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get back.

52:35.021 --> 52:36.718
- Get back.
- Get back. Get back.
Get behind me.

52:39.678 --> 52:41.245
Shoo! Shoo!

52:48.469 --> 52:50.863
Why are they throwing
rocks at me?

52:50.993 --> 52:52.908
- So rude.

52:53.039 --> 52:55.259
It switched on.

52:55.389 --> 52:57.261
First, you come
to steal my babies.

52:57.391 --> 52:59.393
Then you go
throw rocks at me.

52:59.524 --> 53:02.353
Um, Miss Alligator,
we're not trying
to steal your babies.

53:02.483 --> 53:05.660
Good. You'd be
in a lot more trouble.

53:05.791 --> 53:07.401
What brings you out this far?

53:07.532 --> 53:12.537
Um, we were looking
for Allister's Cove,
but we got lost.

53:12.667 --> 53:14.974
Allister's Cove
is just down the river.

53:15.104 --> 53:19.283
Tell you what, as an apology
for trying to eat you
25 years ago,

53:19.413 --> 53:21.459
why don't you take
that rowboat over there?

53:24.810 --> 53:26.725
Look, I'm sorry
about your eye.

53:27.465 --> 53:30.511
I wish I would have known
all those years ago
that you were...

53:31.773 --> 53:33.471
just trying to protect
your family.

53:33.601 --> 53:35.821
Aw, don't mention it.

53:35.951 --> 53:37.953
Well, so long now.

53:38.084 --> 53:39.694
Y'all have a pleasant trip.

53:41.479 --> 53:44.873
My invention works.
I knew it. I knew it.

53:45.613 --> 53:46.745
-  Oh, yes.
- Good job, Woody.

53:46.875 --> 53:47.963
Yeah, man.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.315
- All right, we gotta keep
a move on.
- That's great.

53:51.445 --> 53:52.968
Let's go. This way.

54:16.601 --> 54:17.602
Let's go.

54:20.822 --> 54:21.867
Okay.

54:22.694 --> 54:24.478
Now I feel like
I'm in a Mark Twain novel.

54:24.609 --> 54:27.176
- Nah, we're in a movie.
- Wow.

54:27.786 --> 54:31.180
Okay, the location
of the next map
is right over that ridge.

54:31.311 --> 54:32.573
Okay, let's go.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.401
Hurry.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.233
This way.

54:40.364 --> 54:41.713
That's my idea.

54:42.844 --> 54:45.847
I think it could work,
but I'll think it out.

54:49.590 --> 54:52.593
"What's done on a dare
yet comes in two pairs?

54:52.724 --> 54:56.118
How I'll spend mine, I know,
but what will you get
with your share?"

54:57.424 --> 54:58.599
Share.

54:58.730 --> 55:00.471
I got it. Okay.

55:00.601 --> 55:04.431
Huck asked Tom
what would he do
with his share of the loot.

55:04.562 --> 55:05.998
Chapter 25.

55:07.434 --> 55:10.132
Yeah, it's right here. Okay.

55:10.263 --> 55:12.483
"Tom said he'll buy
these four things.

55:13.135 --> 55:15.094
A drum."

55:16.138 --> 55:17.923
Uh... Okay, the drum.

55:20.447 --> 55:22.188
"A sure-'nough sword."

55:22.319 --> 55:24.321
- Oh, over there.
- Oh, there it is.

55:27.411 --> 55:29.021
"A red necktie."

55:29.151 --> 55:31.066
Uh, necktie. Got it.

55:32.851 --> 55:34.113
"And a bull!"

55:37.682 --> 55:39.988
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

55:40.119 --> 55:42.077
Wait, bull pup!

55:42.208 --> 55:44.036
- Bull pup!

55:44.166 --> 55:45.864
- Bull pup!
- Bull pup!

55:51.304 --> 55:52.653
Everyone okay?
You okay?

55:52.784 --> 55:54.263
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

56:05.884 --> 56:08.147
Dude, will this
riddle ever end?

56:08.277 --> 56:09.714
Oh.

56:09.844 --> 56:12.978
Woody, this looks like
a task for you.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.284
Here.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.657
You know what we're
gonna do at first light?

56:39.787 --> 56:41.267
Mm-hmm.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.922
- We're gonna track down
those wannabes,
- Mm-hmm.

56:44.052 --> 56:46.751
those imposter
treasure hunters,

56:47.491 --> 56:48.492
and then...

56:49.884 --> 56:53.105
it's all gonna be
about fame and glory.

56:53.235 --> 56:55.673
Oh, and don't
forget the gold.

56:59.024 --> 57:01.418
I almost-- I almost
forgot about the gold.

57:03.202 --> 57:04.769
Let's not forget the gold.

57:06.814 --> 57:08.729
Hey, Lennon.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.471
Are you having trouble
pitching that tent?

57:11.602 --> 57:13.865
"Let's go treasure
hunting," you said.

57:13.995 --> 57:16.955
"It'll be fun," you said.
What is this?

57:17.085 --> 57:19.523
Are you not having fun?

57:19.653 --> 57:23.962
I just thought we could spend
some uncle-nephew time.

57:24.092 --> 57:25.572
Maybe he don't want
his share?

57:25.703 --> 57:26.704
Oh, yeah.

57:34.146 --> 57:36.061
I gotta get this.

57:36.191 --> 57:38.716
Yeah, it's a steamboat.

57:40.718 --> 57:43.634
How's a steamboat gonna
help us find the next map?

57:43.764 --> 57:46.811
Um, maybe it'll float
to where it is.

57:46.941 --> 57:48.552
Well, the map said,

57:49.161 --> 57:51.555
"Look within and you'll see."

57:58.257 --> 58:01.042
Whoa, I think
these are coordinates.

58:01.173 --> 58:02.217
Oh.

58:03.784 --> 58:06.352
- Okay.
- Um, longitude,

58:07.179 --> 58:13.490
27.7676 degrees north.

58:14.273 --> 58:16.971
- Got it.
- Latitude, uh,

58:17.102 --> 58:24.109
82.6403 degrees west.

58:25.589 --> 58:26.720
West...

58:29.070 --> 58:30.115
Oh.

58:31.595 --> 58:33.379
Oh, that's--
that's just right over here.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.642
- Oh!
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

58:35.773 --> 58:37.209
- Come on.
- Check it out.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.176
This is the spot.

58:49.308 --> 58:51.528
Yeah, it's supposed
to be right here, but...

58:52.616 --> 58:54.182
Does it say anything
else in there?

58:54.313 --> 58:55.401
Um...

58:57.359 --> 58:58.404
Wait.

58:59.361 --> 59:00.406
Oh!

59:01.407 --> 59:05.716
Found it.
Uh, "Twain 0.12"?

59:06.891 --> 59:08.501
That cheeky bugger.

59:09.110 --> 59:11.548
- A twain...
- Is a measurement of depth.

59:12.070 --> 59:13.854
You were paying attention.

59:14.507 --> 59:19.860
And 0.12 percent of a twain
is about a foot and a half.

59:19.991 --> 59:21.296
Get the shovel
out of my backpack.

59:21.427 --> 59:22.559
Hold this.

59:34.222 --> 59:36.268
Almost there.
Come on, Woody.

59:38.662 --> 59:40.011
Wait.

59:46.887 --> 59:48.497
Whoa!

1:00:04.731 --> 1:00:08.387
Oh. The moths must have eaten
it away like the other map.

1:00:08.517 --> 1:00:11.390
No, it needs to be aligned
with the first map.

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.174
Look.

1:00:13.305 --> 1:00:15.786
Oh, that-that's why the rhyme
was so weird in the other one.

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:18.005
Well, do you remember
the other words?

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:22.706
I do, but without it
being perfectly lined up,
it-it wouldn't make any sense.

1:00:22.836 --> 1:00:24.577
We need that
first map back.

1:00:25.839 --> 1:00:28.102
I might have
a stroke of luck for you.

1:00:28.233 --> 1:00:31.410
It appears you have
some scallywags following you.

1:00:31.540 --> 1:00:34.369
They set up camp
right outside my hidey-hole.

1:00:34.979 --> 1:00:36.154
Okay.

1:00:36.284 --> 1:00:38.809
Operation Treasure Map
Rescue commence.

1:00:38.939 --> 1:00:39.984
Um...

1:00:40.549 --> 1:00:43.552
I'll come up with something
snappier on the way.

1:00:43.683 --> 1:00:44.728
-  That's true.
- That was terrible.

1:00:44.858 --> 1:00:45.903
Please.

1:00:48.253 --> 1:00:50.429
<i>So she was about
five-foot-ten.</i>

1:00:51.038 --> 1:00:52.605
She said her name
was Margaret.

1:00:57.828 --> 1:01:00.787
There's the map, right next
to the water cooler.

1:01:00.918 --> 1:01:03.834
Told you guys, bringing this
would come in handy.

1:01:03.964 --> 1:01:06.140
Those filmmaking skills
may have just saved the day.

1:01:06.271 --> 1:01:08.316
Okay, so here's
what we're gonna do.

1:01:09.317 --> 1:01:10.492
Actually...

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:13.278
Ant, what do you think
we should do?

1:01:15.062 --> 1:01:17.978
Okay. Um...

1:01:18.109 --> 1:01:20.198
Lu, you're gonna sneak in
to get the map.

1:01:20.328 --> 1:01:22.243
Copy that.

1:01:22.374 --> 1:01:23.984
Woody, you hide behind
the tree and be ready
to protect her, okay?

1:01:24.115 --> 1:01:25.420
Sir, yes, sir.

1:01:25.551 --> 1:01:27.858
Mom, you circle
around that exit.

1:01:28.641 --> 1:01:31.078
- Roger that.
- And I'm gonna distract them.

1:01:31.209 --> 1:01:32.993
- Everyone got it?
- Got it.

1:01:33.124 --> 1:01:34.125
Right, then.

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:40.435
Well, we're surrounded,

1:01:40.566 --> 1:01:42.394
and, uh,
the whole tribe--

1:01:42.524 --> 1:01:45.223
- Huh?

1:01:45.353 --> 1:01:48.400
- What was that?

1:01:48.530 --> 1:01:49.793
Lennon, go
check it out.

1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:04.633
You're dead, mama's boy!

1:02:13.077 --> 1:02:14.295
Nothing but net, Lennon.

1:02:14.426 --> 1:02:16.471
I'm gonna get you!

1:02:23.609 --> 1:02:25.089
The map is gone.

1:02:26.090 --> 1:02:28.919
The girl's got the map.
Come here, you--

1:02:29.049 --> 1:02:31.356
I'm gonna get you!

1:02:34.968 --> 1:02:36.143
-  Ha-ha!

1:02:37.188 --> 1:02:40.539
Now you know why
they call me Wood-y.

1:02:45.370 --> 1:02:46.414
AJ?

1:02:47.938 --> 1:02:50.418
Ugh, head of natural history.

1:02:50.549 --> 1:02:52.507
I should have known
that you were behind this.

1:02:52.638 --> 1:02:55.423
Well, I am
a treasure hunter, Agatha,

1:02:55.554 --> 1:02:58.775
and you should know
not to get between
a treasure hunter...

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:01.516
- and his gold.

1:03:01.647 --> 1:03:03.431
What are you gonna do,
AJ, hurt me?

1:03:03.562 --> 1:03:06.086
Yeah, I am.

1:03:06.217 --> 1:03:07.696
You wouldn't dare.

1:03:07.827 --> 1:03:09.394
What makes you so sure?

1:03:09.524 --> 1:03:12.484
Well, let's face it.
You've always been
in love with me.

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:17.924
Me, in love with you!?

1:03:18.055 --> 1:03:20.666
Wow, that is a big alligator!

1:03:22.668 --> 1:03:24.235
That is an alligator.

1:03:24.365 --> 1:03:27.716
And, uh, we're gonna put
a pin in this for now. Buttons!

1:03:27.847 --> 1:03:30.763
- Buttons!

1:03:33.679 --> 1:03:34.941
Thanks, Marielle.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:42.296
<i>So how
do you know him?</i>

1:03:42.427 --> 1:03:46.474
I was his, uh,
research assistant
in college.

1:03:47.171 --> 1:03:50.696
Yeah, we explored
the world together,
and on our last exploration,

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:53.568
he scammed me.

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:57.007
So, um, we haven't
seen each other since.

1:03:57.137 --> 1:03:58.530
- Did you see him?

1:03:58.660 --> 1:03:59.879
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:04:00.010 --> 1:04:02.229
Okay, let's take out
the maps.

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:03.404
Oh.

1:04:03.927 --> 1:04:06.364
- Line them up.
- Here.

1:04:06.494 --> 1:04:09.889
Um, "Dip to the moonlight,
dip, dip, dip.

1:04:10.498 --> 1:04:12.936
Three for you
and five for me."

1:04:13.066 --> 1:04:14.067
A riddle?

1:04:14.676 --> 1:04:15.764
No, it's a song.

1:04:16.722 --> 1:04:18.245
And I know just
where I've heard it.

1:04:25.687 --> 1:04:27.385
- Detective!
- Detective Thatcher!

1:04:27.515 --> 1:04:29.300
- Is the detective in?
- No, no, no, he's very busy.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:30.910
- He can't talk right now.
- But we need to speak to him!

1:04:32.433 --> 1:04:33.957
What's the commotion about?

1:04:34.087 --> 1:04:35.610
You after Huck Finn's
gold now, too?

1:04:35.741 --> 1:04:37.743
We made the decision
to keep looking.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.658
Yeah,
and we found these.

1:04:39.788 --> 1:04:42.530
When you line them up
correctly, they spell out
this rhyme.

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:45.620
- That's the family song.
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:48.101
I remember you
humming it in the car.

1:04:48.232 --> 1:04:49.798
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:54.020
You'd make quite
the detective,
Miss Armstrong.

1:04:55.152 --> 1:04:57.197
Oh, you made
quite the impression.

1:05:02.811 --> 1:05:04.117
Uh, you're singing.

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:05.771
Uh, you're singing made
quite the impression,

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.120
- and that's why...
- Mom.

1:05:07.251 --> 1:05:08.948
- The maps. Come on.
- Right.

1:05:10.994 --> 1:05:13.735
It-it was an old
family song.

1:05:13.866 --> 1:05:16.738
My grandmother
sang it to my father,
who sang it to me.

1:05:17.261 --> 1:05:18.827
Our family
were coal miners,

1:05:19.219 --> 1:05:22.657
and our great-great-grandpa
came up with it
to get his spirits up

1:05:22.788 --> 1:05:25.138
when he was trapped down
in a mine for four days

1:05:25.269 --> 1:05:27.401
- in the 1800s.
-  Mm.

1:05:27.532 --> 1:05:31.101
So it's hinting at being hidden
somewhere deep underground.

1:05:31.231 --> 1:05:34.626
The nearest place
is McDougal's Caves
where we found you guys.

1:05:34.756 --> 1:05:36.541
Ugh. But we already
looked there!

1:05:36.671 --> 1:05:37.890
Yeah, to no avail.

1:05:38.847 --> 1:05:40.501
Not with a Sawyer,
you didn't.

1:05:41.154 --> 1:05:42.677
You're coming?

1:05:42.808 --> 1:05:44.549
- Yes!
- Let's go!

1:05:44.679 --> 1:05:46.290
- Let's find that gold!

1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:47.465
Whoo!

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:55.212
Oh.

1:05:55.386 --> 1:05:58.084
Legend has it
that more have entered
than have returned.

1:05:58.693 --> 1:06:00.782
So, stay close, guys.

1:06:02.088 --> 1:06:04.525
Does that mean someone
has died in here?

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:07.615
-  No. Oh!

1:06:10.227 --> 1:06:11.968
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.710
Just-- just stay together.

1:06:18.887 --> 1:06:19.932
It's okay, man.

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:29.898
"Dip to the moonlight."

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:35.643
Guys, uh, find a place
in the roof where light
can beam through.

1:06:38.603 --> 1:06:39.691
Right there.

1:06:40.779 --> 1:06:41.823
Great.

1:06:42.607 --> 1:06:46.002
Now, if we can "dip, dip, dip"

1:06:46.132 --> 1:06:48.004
- underneath these rocks...
-  Mm-hmm.

1:06:48.134 --> 1:06:49.788
...we should be close,
right here.

1:06:50.528 --> 1:06:53.966
And then it says,
"Three for you
and five for me."

1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:57.317
Paces, right?

1:06:57.448 --> 1:06:59.363
But where do we start?

1:07:00.407 --> 1:07:01.974
Um, we can...

1:07:06.326 --> 1:07:08.850
Oh. Maybe out that cross.

1:07:09.677 --> 1:07:12.332
Yeah. That's gotta
be it, right?

1:07:13.812 --> 1:07:16.032
Okay, so, paces, right?

1:07:16.162 --> 1:07:17.207
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:17.337 --> 1:07:18.425
Three and five.

1:07:19.818 --> 1:07:23.561
One, two, three.

1:07:25.954 --> 1:07:30.437
One, two, three,

1:07:30.568 --> 1:07:33.440
four, five.

1:07:34.702 --> 1:07:35.964
Look above you.

1:07:37.357 --> 1:07:38.402
Anything?

1:07:39.968 --> 1:07:41.448
I don't know.

1:07:49.326 --> 1:07:51.371
- You got something?
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1:07:52.981 --> 1:07:54.983
-  Whoa!
-  Good.

1:07:55.114 --> 1:07:57.073
We found the map.

1:08:03.775 --> 1:08:05.559
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

1:08:05.690 --> 1:08:08.258
"If flood or fire

1:08:08.388 --> 1:08:10.260
should harm me..."

1:08:10.390 --> 1:08:12.175
"I take from you five

1:08:12.305 --> 1:08:13.785
and give you my three."

1:08:15.047 --> 1:08:16.440
"Take from you..."

1:08:16.570 --> 1:08:18.224
- No.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:20.139
Take it all from you.

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:25.318
I would like
to thank the inventor
of this, uh,

1:08:25.449 --> 1:08:27.538
ridiculous contraption.

1:08:27.668 --> 1:08:32.586
The GPS within helped us
track you all the way here.

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:36.590
Lennon.

1:08:37.896 --> 1:08:39.332
All right, phones out.
Give them up.

1:08:39.463 --> 1:08:40.551
-  No.
- Just do it.

1:08:40.681 --> 1:08:42.466
- Out, out. Now.
- It's not worth it.

1:08:43.945 --> 1:08:47.123
Give me.
Ooh, XR-17. Nice.

1:08:47.253 --> 1:08:50.213
Thank you.
And, of course...

1:08:51.692 --> 1:08:52.998
- You.
- No.

1:08:54.304 --> 1:08:58.221
Oh. This is gonna take me
all the way to the gold.

1:08:58.351 --> 1:08:59.396
You won't get far.

1:09:00.310 --> 1:09:01.528
Just watch me.

1:09:02.703 --> 1:09:06.620
Agatha, you've spent your
whole life chasing history.

1:09:07.317 --> 1:09:08.405
Allow me

1:09:10.363 --> 1:09:11.799
to add you to it.

1:09:21.679 --> 1:09:22.810
Bye-bye now.

1:09:26.074 --> 1:09:27.685
- Back. Go. Go. Now!
- Go to the back!

1:09:27.815 --> 1:09:29.426
Run!

1:09:35.345 --> 1:09:37.347
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

1:09:37.477 --> 1:09:40.001
I think we owe 'em
a moment of respect.

1:09:42.090 --> 1:09:45.093
Agatha, you were
a worthy foe,

1:09:45.224 --> 1:09:48.793
but, uh, you know, we all meet
our makers someday, right?

1:09:48.923 --> 1:09:50.577
And, uh, furthermore,

1:09:52.144 --> 1:09:53.406
that's good.

1:09:53.537 --> 1:09:54.799
Let's go get rich.

1:10:07.115 --> 1:10:08.160
Oh, no.

1:10:10.902 --> 1:10:12.295
This is all my fault.

1:10:13.818 --> 1:10:18.170
What? No, Woody, you are
not to blame for his greed.

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:21.478
No.

1:10:21.608 --> 1:10:26.570
<i>"And what does
it amount to?" said Satan
with his evil chuckle.</i>

1:10:27.875 --> 1:10:29.703
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

1:10:29.834 --> 1:10:33.229
<i>You always come out
where you went in.</i>

1:10:33.359 --> 1:10:38.364
<i>Oh, for them to get this far
to only have it snatched
at their final hurdle,</i>

1:10:38.495 --> 1:10:41.411
<i>life sure is a kick
in the guts sometimes.</i>

1:10:54.685 --> 1:10:56.600
Someone will be here eventually.

1:10:58.602 --> 1:10:59.820
No, they won't.

1:11:00.865 --> 1:11:02.345
This is hopeless.

1:11:03.694 --> 1:11:06.653
And to think this is how
it's all gonna end.

1:11:08.133 --> 1:11:12.572
And-- and I never even got
the chance to change the world
with one of my inventions.

1:11:13.181 --> 1:11:15.488
I never got to win
an Oscar.

1:11:16.141 --> 1:11:18.535
I never made the news
catching criminals.

1:11:19.623 --> 1:11:21.451
Not even once.

1:11:23.191 --> 1:11:24.758
And I never...

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:29.763
Oh, no, I've--

1:11:29.894 --> 1:11:33.376
I've really gotten to do
pretty much everything
there is to do,

1:11:33.506 --> 1:11:35.682
so, never mind.

1:11:40.905 --> 1:11:42.254
What about you, Ant?

1:11:43.342 --> 1:11:45.692
Uh, I...

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:50.480
It's dumb.

1:11:50.610 --> 1:11:53.352
- Mm, come on.
- It doesn't matter.

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:59.140
Well... Listen,
we just have to look
on the bright side, okay?

1:11:59.793 --> 1:12:02.622
They're not gonna get
very far without that
torn piece from the letter.

1:12:03.884 --> 1:12:07.235
Wait. How do you know
that the letter was torn?

1:12:09.673 --> 1:12:12.371
You told me that it was.

1:12:13.503 --> 1:12:15.374
Uh, no.

1:12:15.505 --> 1:12:16.941
I didn't tell you.

1:12:17.855 --> 1:12:20.074
Okay.

1:12:20.901 --> 1:12:25.341
Well, maybe
this isn't my first time

1:12:26.429 --> 1:12:28.213
looking for Tom Sawyer's
treasure.

1:12:38.136 --> 1:12:39.355
Oh, wait.

1:12:47.798 --> 1:12:49.147
Do you know what this means?

1:12:51.279 --> 1:12:52.455
No.

1:13:11.343 --> 1:13:12.518
- Oh!

1:13:12.649 --> 1:13:15.347
What in the name
of all that's holy?

1:13:15.478 --> 1:13:18.568
Hmm. You don't see that
every-- Oh!

1:13:18.698 --> 1:13:20.831
Come back here,
you wee scully.

1:13:25.009 --> 1:13:26.619
That was a good burger,
my friend.

1:13:27.577 --> 1:13:28.665
Whoa!

1:13:30.797 --> 1:13:33.757
- What?
- That's ten types
of illegal right there.

1:13:43.288 --> 1:13:45.551
We've been going
in circles for hours.

1:13:45.682 --> 1:13:47.335
Do you not know
how to read this map?

1:13:47.466 --> 1:13:48.859
Mm, no.

1:13:48.989 --> 1:13:51.252
Each map seems to point
in a different direction.

1:13:51.383 --> 1:13:54.517
One goes here, one goes there,
one goes nowhere.

1:13:56.344 --> 1:13:57.433
Wait a minute.

1:14:04.918 --> 1:14:08.531
There is a reason
why the world's
most renowned explorer,

1:14:08.661 --> 1:14:10.358
an anthropological--

1:14:10.489 --> 1:14:12.796
You're an anthropologist,
Uncle AJ.

1:14:13.753 --> 1:14:14.798
Whatever.

1:14:15.929 --> 1:14:19.933
The secret hiding place
to Tom Sawyer's gold is...

1:14:21.544 --> 1:14:23.850
- The Temperance Tavern.
- The Temperance Tavern.

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:25.286
T-this way!

1:14:36.863 --> 1:14:38.430
Oh, what in the dickens?

1:14:39.518 --> 1:14:42.347
Oh, no.
The battery died.

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:45.481
- Um...
- Oh.

1:14:51.574 --> 1:14:53.663
That's Detective
Thatcher's car.

1:14:53.793 --> 1:14:57.101
Meow. Meow. Meow--

1:14:57.231 --> 1:14:58.668
Okay, fine, I'm a talking cat.

1:14:58.798 --> 1:15:00.017
Yawnfest.

1:15:00.147 --> 1:15:01.758
Now, will you please go
into those caves,

1:15:01.888 --> 1:15:04.021
follow their scent,
and rescue my friends,

1:15:04.151 --> 1:15:07.807
who heavens to Betsy
I fear may well be
trapped down there?

1:15:07.938 --> 1:15:08.939
Let's go.

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:11.637
And don't you dillydally.

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:16.468
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>

1:15:17.425 --> 1:15:19.123
Call more reinforcements
to secure the perimeter

1:15:19.253 --> 1:15:20.777
- at the final site.
- Got it.

1:15:21.821 --> 1:15:23.693
- We'll meet you guys there.
- Okay.

1:15:24.389 --> 1:15:25.564
Do we need to draw
the map again?

1:15:25.695 --> 1:15:27.653
No, I know exactly
where it is.

1:15:28.872 --> 1:15:32.092
Hey, um, you did
a really good job in there.

1:15:32.223 --> 1:15:33.529
Oh, thank you.

1:15:53.113 --> 1:15:54.941
As a student of history,

1:15:56.464 --> 1:16:01.426
I have to ask myself what
stories would these walls
tell if they could speak.

1:16:03.167 --> 1:16:06.170
If you bothered to read
the book, you'd already
know the answer.

1:16:07.301 --> 1:16:08.389
Agatha,

1:16:09.695 --> 1:16:10.696
how did you--

1:16:11.088 --> 1:16:12.393
No matter.

1:16:13.307 --> 1:16:17.660
So, bringing your encyclopedic
knowledge of literature
to a gunfight, I see.

1:16:17.790 --> 1:16:19.226
It has perfect aim.

1:16:19.357 --> 1:16:21.141
Well, I will tell you this.

1:16:21.272 --> 1:16:24.928
I'm gonna fill you all
full of new holes
to breathe from

1:16:25.624 --> 1:16:27.626
if you don't tell us
where that treasure is.

1:16:28.322 --> 1:16:31.021
The gold was never hidden
in just one place.

1:16:32.283 --> 1:16:33.850
See, it was...

1:16:34.764 --> 1:16:38.898
always that last line
in the riddle
that really stumped me.

1:16:39.682 --> 1:16:42.206
"Take from you five
and give you my three."

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:46.950
Ant, what does Twain's opening
passage in his book say?

1:16:48.865 --> 1:16:52.608
"Tom Sawyer is a combination
of the characteristics
of three boys whom I knew,

1:16:52.738 --> 1:16:55.393
and therefore belongs
to the composite order
of architecture."

1:16:55.523 --> 1:17:00.311
So, what are you saying?
Tom Sawyer wasn't real?

1:17:00.441 --> 1:17:01.834
Oh, no, he was real.

1:17:02.922 --> 1:17:05.882
But three made up this story.

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.761
Miss Armstrong, yes,

1:17:15.892 --> 1:17:17.328
I've been expecting you.

1:17:21.985 --> 1:17:24.204
That gold belonged
to just three men.

1:17:24.727 --> 1:17:27.904
Thomas Sawyer, Ben Rogers...

1:17:28.034 --> 1:17:29.209
And Joe Harper.

1:17:30.428 --> 1:17:31.821
My great-grandpappy.

1:17:33.039 --> 1:17:35.302
That ol' Tom Sawyer
made a promise

1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:39.916
to not let that gold
fall into Angus' hands.

1:17:40.046 --> 1:17:43.528
<i>Just as
I promised to never
let it fall into yours.</i>

1:17:43.659 --> 1:17:47.184
<i>You were obsessive
from the day we met
about your family's fortune.</i>

1:17:47.314 --> 1:17:49.273
<i>So after you
double-crossed me,</i>

1:17:49.403 --> 1:17:52.232
<i>I made it my goal to seek out
every last detail</i>

1:17:52.363 --> 1:17:54.887
<i>to ensure you never found it.</i>

1:17:55.018 --> 1:17:58.456
<i>So I destroyed its final secret
to always keep you at bay,</i>

1:17:58.586 --> 1:18:00.893
<i>and I've been carrying
the remainder of that letter</i>

1:18:01.024 --> 1:18:05.506
<i>and the location of the gold
in my head all of these years.</i>

1:18:08.988 --> 1:18:13.036
Wait a minute,
if you had all
this information,

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:15.516
why didn't you come
for the treasure yourself?

1:18:15.647 --> 1:18:16.735
I tried.

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:21.000
But not every stone
needs to be turned,

1:18:21.609 --> 1:18:23.394
not every treasure pocketed.

1:18:24.090 --> 1:18:26.440
Well, Aggy...

1:18:27.006 --> 1:18:28.355
That's where we differ.

1:18:29.966 --> 1:18:32.142
See, the only thing
that matters to me...

1:18:33.621 --> 1:18:34.884
Ant!

1:18:35.014 --> 1:18:36.668
You're gonna tell me
where the gold is.

1:18:36.799 --> 1:18:39.323
The safety is on, you moron.

1:18:39.453 --> 1:18:41.194
Moron?

1:18:47.418 --> 1:18:48.680
-  Ah!

1:18:50.943 --> 1:18:52.336
I'll tell you this.

1:18:58.690 --> 1:19:01.258
I was the captain
of my fencing team

1:19:01.388 --> 1:19:02.825
at college!

1:19:03.913 --> 1:19:06.393
Impressive.
But so was I.

1:19:07.177 --> 1:19:09.483
- Get him, Miss Armstrong.
- Come on!

1:19:10.441 --> 1:19:12.399
- Come on, Uncle AJ.
- Let's go, Miss Armstrong.

1:19:17.665 --> 1:19:19.319
- Come on, Uncle AJ!

1:19:23.323 --> 1:19:25.761
- Come on!
- Come on, Miss Armstrong!

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:31.505
- Ah!

1:19:31.636 --> 1:19:33.029
- Miss Armstrong!
- Be careful!

1:19:34.378 --> 1:19:36.032
It's too bad, Agatha.

1:19:36.162 --> 1:19:39.078
We could have been partners.
It's a shame, isn't it?

1:19:39.209 --> 1:19:40.645
Don't hurt my mom!

1:19:41.211 --> 1:19:43.953
Do what you want.
I might do something like this.

1:19:44.910 --> 1:19:46.346
No!

1:19:46.956 --> 1:19:49.567
What are you gonna
say now, punk? Huh?

1:19:54.702 --> 1:19:56.748
- Mrs. Mac!
- Enough.

1:19:56.879 --> 1:19:58.619
Don't! He's your son.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:01.231
He's my what?

1:20:01.361 --> 1:20:02.623
Morocco?

1:20:05.496 --> 1:20:06.976
- Oh.

1:20:07.106 --> 1:20:09.195
And then you left me abandoned
on the side of a cliff.

1:20:09.326 --> 1:20:11.676
I never wanted
to speak to you again.

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:13.330
Aggy, why didn't you tell me?

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:15.027
- Freeze!

1:20:15.158 --> 1:20:17.334
Aggy, why didn't you tell me?

1:20:17.464 --> 1:20:19.249
- Cuff him.
- This is my son?

1:20:19.379 --> 1:20:20.772
Now I can see it.

1:20:21.555 --> 1:20:23.906
You're almost
as good-looking as I am.

1:20:24.036 --> 1:20:25.559
- You're under arrest.

1:20:26.299 --> 1:20:28.824
Kidnapping, attempted murder,
assaulting a police officer,

1:20:28.954 --> 1:20:30.869
theft, destruction
of public property.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.785
And I think you have a case
with animal welfare.

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.787
- Let's go.
- Whatever, cop.

1:20:35.918 --> 1:20:38.834
I'll be out by morning.
I love you, son!

1:20:38.964 --> 1:20:42.402
Aggy! We'll always have Morocco!

1:20:50.846 --> 1:20:52.325
Ant, are you okay?

1:20:53.805 --> 1:20:55.328
I don't even know, man.

1:21:02.292 --> 1:21:03.771
Goodbye, my old friend.

1:21:09.081 --> 1:21:11.344
Excuse me,
who are you calling old?

1:21:11.475 --> 1:21:13.085
Don't play like that.

1:21:13.216 --> 1:21:15.479
- Mrs. Mac...
- You're alive.

1:21:15.609 --> 1:21:20.092
Yes, well, I guess that's,
hmm, five down, four to go.

1:21:21.137 --> 1:21:23.835
Well, you go rest.
We'll be right back.

1:21:23.966 --> 1:21:26.185
Ah, time for a wee catnap.

1:21:26.316 --> 1:21:27.447
So long.

1:21:40.808 --> 1:21:44.247
I now know why you never
told me about him.

1:21:50.818 --> 1:21:51.907
But what about this?

1:21:53.212 --> 1:21:54.213
It's...

1:21:55.606 --> 1:21:57.695
just a dime store novelty.

1:21:58.348 --> 1:22:00.828
I'm sorry, I just--
I thought that

1:22:02.221 --> 1:22:05.529
the mystery of who he was
being wrapped up in a trinket

1:22:06.573 --> 1:22:08.184
felt fitting for us.

1:22:09.576 --> 1:22:11.143
No, yeah, I-I get it.

1:22:12.449 --> 1:22:13.537
Really.

1:22:13.667 --> 1:22:15.017
I'm sorry.

1:22:23.764 --> 1:22:24.809
So...

1:22:25.853 --> 1:22:27.203
there's no gold?

1:22:28.726 --> 1:22:30.815
Oh, no,
there's definitely gold.

1:22:31.772 --> 1:22:34.253
I just had to wait
for the detective
to bring his backup.

1:22:36.255 --> 1:22:37.822
Wait, so then where is it?

1:22:38.866 --> 1:22:41.608
Somewhere out in that yard
are the final clues

1:22:41.739 --> 1:22:44.829
that the three men
who inspired
this very book left.

1:22:45.743 --> 1:22:47.832
Joe Harper, Ben Rogers,
and Tom Sawyer himself.

1:22:47.963 --> 1:22:51.096
And if we find his three,

1:22:51.227 --> 1:22:54.230
then we'll find what
"take from you five" means.

1:22:56.319 --> 1:22:57.537
So, let's go.

1:22:58.974 --> 1:23:01.367
- We're gonna find that gold.
- Yeah.

1:23:25.696 --> 1:23:29.439
Hey, I found a "TS Loves MD".

1:23:29.569 --> 1:23:31.093
Okay, that's one.

1:23:33.921 --> 1:23:35.358
Where are you?

1:23:37.142 --> 1:23:38.839
Oh, I found the second.

1:23:55.465 --> 1:23:56.988
I found Ben Rogers.

1:24:00.861 --> 1:24:03.734
"Take from you five
and give you my three."

1:24:06.389 --> 1:24:09.870
Okay. Take five paces
towards the center.

1:24:18.618 --> 1:24:19.924
So we're standing on it?

1:24:22.013 --> 1:24:24.146
We're about to find out. Shovel.

1:24:24.276 --> 1:24:26.670
- Lu, can you grab mine?
- Yeah.

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:29.803
<i>Now, if that don't
prove the true meaning
of teamwork, huh?</i>

1:24:29.934 --> 1:24:35.505
Everyone giving their own
special little part
of themselves to help find it.

1:24:35.635 --> 1:24:38.247
Then they surely went
and changed the meaning on me.

1:24:38.377 --> 1:24:39.552
- Oh!

1:24:40.162 --> 1:24:41.511
- You hear that?
- Hear that?

1:24:54.828 --> 1:24:56.526
- Oh!

1:24:56.656 --> 1:24:59.616
- We did it!

1:24:59.746 --> 1:25:01.966
- All right!
- Wow!

1:25:02.793 --> 1:25:04.099
So much of it.

1:25:06.623 --> 1:25:08.146
This is so pretty.

1:25:09.452 --> 1:25:10.583
It's real.

1:25:15.762 --> 1:25:17.460
It's a shame we can't keep it.

1:25:17.590 --> 1:25:18.548
Wait, what?

1:25:18.678 --> 1:25:20.941
No, we found it, it's ours.

1:25:21.072 --> 1:25:25.772
No, he's right.
It belongs to the Sawyers
and the Harpers and the Rogers.

1:25:26.382 --> 1:25:29.820
I think there will be
a generous finder's fee though.

1:25:29.950 --> 1:25:32.388
-  Seriously?

1:25:32.518 --> 1:25:35.173
Wait, what are we talking,
like fifty-fifty?

1:25:36.218 --> 1:25:38.742
- We'll work something out.
- Hm.

1:25:38.872 --> 1:25:41.701
<i>After the shares
were divvied out,</i>

1:25:41.832 --> 1:25:45.618
they did what anyone
with the right constitution
would have done.

1:25:45.749 --> 1:25:47.664
Went right ahead
and put it back <i>.</i>

1:25:49.056 --> 1:25:50.797
Most of it, anyway.

1:25:50.928 --> 1:25:53.713
<i>All so the next generation
of you thrill-seekers</i>

1:25:53.844 --> 1:25:57.152
<i>could track down
the secret of that pirate gold
for yourselves.</i>

1:25:57.282 --> 1:26:00.459
I think great-great-grandpa
Sawyer would be very proud.

1:26:00.590 --> 1:26:01.765
Yeah?

1:26:02.766 --> 1:26:04.202
<i>And, you know,</i>

1:26:04.333 --> 1:26:07.074
I think Mr. Twain
would have approved too.

1:26:08.032 --> 1:26:09.555
Hm. At the end of the day,

1:26:10.426 --> 1:26:12.515
that's all he ever wanted.

1:26:12.645 --> 1:26:16.345
<i>"A little more kindness,
a little less speed.</i>

1:26:16.475 --> 1:26:20.523
<i>A little more giving,
a little less greed.</i>

1:26:20.653 --> 1:26:24.962
<i>A little more smile,
a little less frown.</i>

1:26:25.092 --> 1:26:29.009
<i>A little less kicking a man
while he's down.</i>

1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:32.578
<i>A little more 'We',
a little less 'I'.</i>

1:26:32.709 --> 1:26:37.192
<i>A little more laugh,
a little less cry.</i>

1:26:37.322 --> 1:26:41.761
<i>A little more flowers
on the pathway of life.</i>

1:26:41.892 --> 1:26:45.200
<i>And fewer on graves
at the end of the strife."</i>
