00:44.520 --> 00:47.390
The Soviet Union has
warned the United States

00:47.440 --> 00:53.040
that an attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships
carrying supplies to the island would mean war.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.230
In a statement from Moscow,

00:56.280 --> 01:01.150
the Russian Foreign Minister Mr Gromyko said
any such attack made by the United States

01:01.200 --> 01:05.510
would plunge the world into the
disaster of a universal world war

01:05.560 --> 01:08.240
with the use of thermonuclear weapons.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.230
"When he opened the Seventh Seal,
there was a silence in Heaven,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.910
about the space of half an hour.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.350
And I saw the angels that stood before God

02:00.400 --> 02:03.340
and to them were given
the seven trumpets."

03:41.840 --> 03:47.030
I've been asked to convey the Chief Constable's
appreciation to Detective Inspector Thursday

03:47.080 --> 03:49.950
for the admirable way he's
held the fort these past weeks.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.920
On behalf of the whole station, sir,
if I might just say, welcome back.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.710
All right, carry on.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.070
Anything pressing that requires
my immediate attention?

04:01.120 --> 04:06.030
One or two burglaries outstanding in the
Oxpens area, sir -- kids, probably, by the mess.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.590
Just through from the Information
Room, sir. Body found at Bramford mere.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.310
- Bramford, you say?
- Bramford mere.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.029
- That's County ground, isn't it?
- Division would like us to deal.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.279
- Laxman went missing out that way.
- Who's this?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.310
Before your time, sir, five years back.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.080
Matthew Laxman.

04:25.080 --> 04:30.030
A botanist, went missing from his
rooms at Wolsey during the long vac.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.070
Last sighting was from a
hitchhiker, Nigel Warren.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.310
Laxman told him he was heading out Bramford
way but his car was never recovered.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.830
- Foul play, you think?
- It wasn't my case, sir.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.750
County investigation for the most part.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.150
But my old bagman, DS Lott, liaised
with them from the city end.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.950
He might not have been as
thorough as he could have been.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.540
And you'd like to set things right.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.070
Well, there we are.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.840
Not half an hour in the station,
all back to normal. Carry on.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.310
- Morning.
- Constable.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.310
Archaeological dig, sir, out of
Courtney College, turned up a hand.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.310
Belongs to the fellow in this trench.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.870
- Morning, Doctor.
- Inspector, gentlemen.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.910
What have you got?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.670
Male, age as yet undetermined.

05:30.720 --> 05:34.230
Remains somewhat compressed
but remarkably well preserved,

05:34.280 --> 05:36.510
due to the acidity of the soil.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.550
- Any chance it could be Laxman?
- Time of death rather mitigates against that.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.950
Time of death?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.030
2,000 years ago.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.070
- 2,000 years?
- Yes.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.510
Give or take a couple of hundred years.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.070
We'll have trouble
notifying his next of kin.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.670
Poor chap does seem to have
had rather a grim time of it.

05:53.720 --> 05:59.230
There's trauma to the skull -- an axe,
perhaps, or a rock -- fatal by itself.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.910
But we also have a garrotte,
tightened by means of a stick.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.030
And finally, his throat has been laid open
with a very sharp blade, right to left.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.190
- Torture, possibly.
- Or ritual.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.470
How's that?

06:11.520 --> 06:14.710
Prevailing school of thought is that
places like this, bodies of water,

06:14.760 --> 06:17.270
held a supernatural
significance to ancient peoples.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.710
They were seen as a gateway
from one world to another.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.070
It could have been an offering made
to whatever deities they worshipped.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.190
- Human sacrifice, you mean?
- Popular with the druids. And what's that?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.710
There.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.760
Oh.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.400
Inspector.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.750
Matthew had a pair quite similar.
It's possible they're his.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.310
- Where did you find them?
- Out at Bramford mere.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.870
Isn't that where he told
the hitchhiker he was going?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.110
Bramford village was the destination.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.900
The mere is about a mile or so outside.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.630
Did he have any business
out there, do you know?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.670
- No.
- And you were out of town

07:09.720 --> 07:11.830
- at the time of his
disappearance, yes? - Mm.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.950
I did tell the police
all this at the time.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.910
We do like to be thorough.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.710
To which end, I must ask,

07:17.760 --> 07:21.640
there was the suggestion that your
marriage wasn't altogether happy.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.110
Matthew was um...

07:27.160 --> 07:30.110
passionate, driven, I suppose,
in his work, in politics.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.430
But he had a temper in drink.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.750
Sometimes...

07:36.800 --> 07:40.120
I felt there was a side to his
life I never really knew at all.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.070
You should speak to Donald,
Professor Bagley at Wolsey.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.870
He probably knew Matthew
better than anyone.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.460
Thank you. That'll be all for now.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.840
Professor Bagley.

08:34.840 --> 08:39.159
Yes, he came by my rooms here as
he did most mornings about 11:00.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.190
We had a glass of sherry
and caught up on the gossip.

08:44.240 --> 08:48.550
After Anne, my wife, died,
he was a good friend.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.680
Have you any idea what he might
have been doing out at Bramford mere?

08:52.840 --> 08:54.830
About his work, I should imagine.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.670
Have you talked to Alison?

08:56.720 --> 08:59.110
Mrs Laxman? We've just
come from there now.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.150
Wonderful girl.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.670
These last years have
been very hard for her,

09:03.720 --> 09:06.320
not knowing if he was alive or dead.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.900
Thank you, Professor.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.390
"And the first angel sounded,

09:17.440 --> 09:21.350
and there followed hail and
fire mingled with blood.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.030
And they were cast upon the earth.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.750
And the third part of trees was burnt up

09:25.800 --> 09:27.790
and all green grass was burnt up!"

09:27.840 --> 09:29.910
Nigel Warren?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.230
City Police.

09:32.280 --> 09:37.150
About five years ago, you hitched a lift off
Dr Matthew Laxman, going out Bramford way.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.990
I gave a statement at the time.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.470
To County, yes, not to us.
We are reviewing the case.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.920
Then you'll know I had an alibi.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.470
Did Laxman say anything
about going to Bramford mere?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.830
I thought he just said to Bramford.
He was in a pretty bad mood.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.750
I think some woman had got his back up.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.270
Did he say who?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.310
His wife, I took it.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.150
Right, well, if anything else comes
back to you, we're at Cowley nick.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
Right.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.190
Get hold of a copy of the
missing persons poster.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.910
And have a patrol car
run you out to Bramford.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.950
Ask around.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.990
See if you can jog any memories.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.030
What?

10:19.080 --> 10:23.950
Well, we're going to a lot of trouble
over a pair of glasses, aren't we?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.110
I mean, if it had been Laxman's
body in the mere, but it wasn't.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.030
Five years. If there was anything to
be found, County would have found it.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.350
County couldn't find their
arse with both hands and a map.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.950
This time we're gonna make
sure it gets done right.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.540
Meet me at the church around 5:00.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.920
Thanks.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.190
There you go, then, sir. On tick, is it?

11:45.240 --> 11:46.430
Yeah, thank you.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.480
- See you on Saturday, shall we?
- I'll try.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.220
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.950
Good afternoon. I'm Detective
Constable Morse, City Police.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.950
You're a long way out,
aren't you, my dear?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.670
I'm looking into the disappearance
of a Dr Matthew Laxman.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.110
He went missing from the
area around five years ago.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.790
Yeah, I remember. Told the police
at the time I hadn't seen him.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.470
Well, I just wondered if you might have
remembered anything in the meantime.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.520
No, sorry.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.430
All right.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.270
Well, thank you.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.470
What's with the Morris men?

12:24.520 --> 12:28.110
Practising their figures for Saturday.
Second harvest -- balance of the year.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.510
- Autumnal equinox.
- That's right.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.950
Day and night, light and
dark in perfect harmony.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.510
Right.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.310
Well, thanks again.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.160
Not at all, my dear. Goddess bless thee.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.840
Hello, there.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.430
- Excuse me.
- Hey?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.580
♪ Hey! ♪

13:56.160 --> 13:59.630
Hello. Detective Constable
Morse, City Police. Miss...?

13:59.680 --> 14:01.790
Mrs Levin. Ros.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.270
How do you do?

14:03.320 --> 14:05.110
Very well, thank you.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.910
I'm looking into the disappearance
of a Dr Matthew Laxman.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.390
He went missing about five
years ago from the area.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.190
We've not been in the area very long.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.630
Jon, my husband, works at the power plant.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.550
Right. American?

14:17.600 --> 14:19.510
Omaha, Nebraska.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.350
And what do you make of it, Bramford?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.600
Yeah, uh... kind of quaint.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.540
And the people seem nice,
if a little strange.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.950
Um... you should talk to Dowsable.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.350
Miss Chattox.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.400
She's a house in the woods
at the bottom of the valley.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.510
Oh, right.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.550
Well, thank you for your help.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.600
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Good luck with everything.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.670
Hello?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.720
Miss Chattox?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.640
Hello?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.910
Hello?

15:47.960 --> 15:49.550
- My name's...
- Morse.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.800
That's your name, isn't it?

15:52.640 --> 15:54.120
Morse.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.190
I've been expecting you.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.890
You really oughtn't to go
round pointing guns at people.

16:04.940 --> 16:08.250
I get all sorts coming here
-- surveyors, water people,

16:08.300 --> 16:10.210
them buggers from the power station.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.090
- Besides, you are trespassing.
- I thought you were expecting me.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.970
What you want coming here, troubling
a poor defenceless old woman?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.530
You didn't seem defenceless
from where I was standing.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.250
I don't know what you bother me for.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.810
I told that other policeman,
the one that come before.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.890
I never saw that Dr Laxman.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.340
Well, that was County, I'm City.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.170
It was five years ago this weekend.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.730
I know when he went. The balance of
the year when the veil is thinnest.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.570
The veil?

16:40.620 --> 16:43.160
Between the world of day and night.

16:44.140 --> 16:47.290
The equinox is science, Miss
Chattox. It's not superstition.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.490
In any event, sometimes people
remember things they forget.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.660
- I don't. - Well, then,
I've had a wasted journey.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.330
Afternoon.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.580
The American girl sent you.

17:00.780 --> 17:03.570
You want to keep an eye on that one.

17:03.620 --> 17:06.180
Darkness presses in close upon her.

17:07.780 --> 17:10.880
There are signs, if you
know how to read them.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.740
A lamb with two heads
was born in the spring.

17:15.859 --> 17:19.060
You ask my grandson Seth
if you don't believe me.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.050
April 11th, Joan's birthday.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.770
"Agnes Chattox.

18:26.820 --> 18:31.770
April 11th, 1623 to September 22nd, 1645.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.610
Spinster of this parish."

18:33.660 --> 18:38.770
I think I just met one of her relatives out
in the woods. Local wise woman... or not.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.450
She were hanged.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.490
Agnes. Tested and hanged.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.610
- For what?
- Consorting with an imp.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.860
And all other manner of
black deviltries besides.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.020
- "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
- Is that right, Mr...?

18:54.060 --> 18:56.660
Zebulon Sadler, sexton of All Souls.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.010
So you've found him, then, have you,

19:00.060 --> 19:02.050
him that's been missing since '62?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.490
That's why you people's all
over the mere, isn't it?

19:04.540 --> 19:07.210
- I don't suppose you
remember seeing him? - No.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.810
- You won't find anybody
hereabouts as did. - Why's that?

19:09.860 --> 19:11.860
Cos he never came here.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.730
- You seem very certain.
- Of course. It was harvest weekend.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.450
Outsiders stand out like a sore thumb.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.290
That be the power plant. They test their
alarm bells every day about the same time.

19:25.340 --> 19:28.540
If you'll excuse me, I've
got a burial to see to.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.850
I see you met our sexton.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.090
Curling your hair with tales of
the devil walking abroad, was he?

19:44.140 --> 19:46.610
- Something like that.
- He can lay it on a bit thick.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.330
Particularly with strangers.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.370
Dr Berger, Tristan.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.690
- DI Thursday.
- I'm the local sawbones.

19:53.740 --> 19:57.050
I have a surgery in Kings Abbott
but I live here in Bramford.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.770
You're looking for that
chap that went missing?

19:59.820 --> 20:01.810
Laxman. You recollect anything?

20:01.860 --> 20:04.250
No, I'm afraid not. I
was away that weekend.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.440
Symposium in the Midlands.

20:07.260 --> 20:11.170
I could ask my sister Selina. She
keeps house for me at The Grange.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.320
- Where can I reach you if --
- Cowley Station.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.410
Well, then. We won't keep you.

20:17.460 --> 20:20.260
Not at all. It was very good to meet you.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.790
Hey!

20:34.340 --> 20:36.140
How was your day?

20:37.340 --> 20:39.410
Well, it was an endless social whirl.

20:39.460 --> 20:41.850
You'll read all about it
in next month's Harper's.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.690
If you want to meet people, you've got to go
to the village. You've got to talk to them.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.050
I don't like the way
some of them look at me.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.810
Well, try Oxford, then.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.850
Um... a policeman came by.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.890
That broke the monotony.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.690
A cop? What did he want?

20:56.740 --> 20:59.650
Someone went missing
near here, a botanist.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.730
- When was this?
- Oh, years ago.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.780
Before we came here.

21:37.820 --> 21:41.410
I knew there was something not
right about the Laxman case.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.260
Right from the off, felt it in my water.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.970
What about County?
Anything of any use there?

21:48.020 --> 21:52.930
I've been through County case files. It
appears to have been a textbook investigation.

21:52.980 --> 21:57.010
That should tell you something. Since
when have County done a textbook anything?

21:57.060 --> 21:58.890
There is one oddity.

21:58.940 --> 22:01.570
They didn't speak to anyone
at Bramford power station.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.530
It's just four miles up the road
from where Laxman disappeared.

22:04.580 --> 22:08.290
Huge staff. 700 potential eyewitnesses
and County didn't speak to one of them.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.930
- See what you can dig out.
- Sir.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.120
Good night, Mrs Thursday.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.980
Win, Morse is going.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.340
She gets lost in her programmes.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.730
- Tell me how you make out.
- There was one more thing.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.050
It's the autumnal equinox this weekend.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.130
I know, because Bramford village
make a big song and dance about it.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.690
- And? - It was the autumnal
equinox five years ago

22:34.740 --> 22:36.050
when Laxman disappeared.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.370
- You're saying they're somehow
connected? - I don't know.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.220
But it is curious.

22:49.940 --> 22:53.930
What's the matter that you
can't say cheerio to Morse?

22:53.980 --> 22:55.460
Win?

22:57.020 --> 22:59.300
Winifred! What's going on?

23:02.140 --> 23:04.130
I thought he was fond of her...

23:04.180 --> 23:06.180
in his way.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.290
Police. When it comes to murder,
you can find a needle in a haystack,

23:11.340 --> 23:14.140
but when it's about your own daughter...

23:14.660 --> 23:16.400
The pair of you.

23:27.780 --> 23:31.080
- Police. - If you could
pull over by the barrier.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.410
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

23:46.460 --> 23:50.360
I'm sorry, sir, there's no
unauthorised access to the site.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.970
This warrant card is my authority.

23:54.020 --> 23:57.290
Up to the gate, sir. Beyond that,
you'll need to make an appointment.

23:57.340 --> 24:00.140
- With whom?
- The appropriate ministry.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.880
Turn the car around, sir.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.090
Look, in the last two hours, I have
spoken to the Atomic Energy Authority,

24:12.140 --> 24:13.570
who referred me to the MoD.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.170
The MoD have referred me to the Permanent
Undersecretary's office, who referred me to you.

24:18.220 --> 24:22.060
I just want to know how I get
access to Bramford power station.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.920
Right, well, thank you for nothing.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.700
Rodents, according to Dr DeBryn.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.170
The specs.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.890
Rats have had a nibble, haven't they?

24:57.460 --> 25:01.060
Anyway, you haven't forgotten
about tonight? Counting on you.

25:02.380 --> 25:07.050
OK, ladies and gentlemen. Ready for the next
question? Get those thinking caps on, please.

25:07.100 --> 25:11.930
Which famous film star, once
married to Conrad Hilton,

25:11.980 --> 25:15.300
married her fifth husband
in March of last year?

25:16.500 --> 25:18.970
Elizabeth Taylor? She's been hitched tons.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.010
- Zsa Zsa Gabor.
- That's it.

25:21.060 --> 25:24.450
Sport now. Which player
on the winning side...

25:32.260 --> 25:35.450
Frank Saul, eh? Who'd have thought?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.900
- Want a chip?
- No, thank you.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.570
Listen, I've been meaning to say.

25:44.620 --> 25:46.930
A mate of mine in London's
starting a new unit.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.130
Asked me if I could
recommend a good bagman.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.690
Thought after that knockback
with your sergeant's...

25:51.740 --> 25:54.210
- It was more than a knockback.
- There you go.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.660
If your face don't fit, matey...

25:57.260 --> 26:00.730
It'd be automatic promotion.
More money, London weighting.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.780
It's a solid offer.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.970
It's a DI Craddock, Tintagel House.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.010
We were at Hendon together.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.260
You should give him a call.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.520
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.230
Little toe rags.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.590
Sorry, matey.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.950
Ah, it's one of those
things. We see it enough.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.670
Yeah, but you're one of our own.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.470
Well, can't stay on here
with it like this, can you?

27:31.520 --> 27:34.630
- Welcome to doss at mine till you
get yourself straight. - Oh, no.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.350
Thank you. Thanks. I'd
sooner make a start.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.750
Right.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.390
Well, the offer's there.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.640
Chin up, matey. Shirl.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.440
Morse.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.750
Strange said they made
a right mess of things.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.110
- It's nothing, really.
- Anything to go on?

27:54.160 --> 27:59.030
Scene of Crime have dusted for prints,
so we'll just have to wait and see.

27:59.080 --> 28:02.680
Miss Berger called the station
from Bramford -- the GP's sister.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.910
- Miss Berger?
- Yes.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.040
DI Thursday, DC Morse. I
believe you rang the station.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.630
It was a Friday. I'd been into
town to return my books to Boots

28:27.680 --> 28:29.750
and to take in a matinee at the cinema.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.870
On the way back to Bramford,
the bus was held up a moment

28:32.920 --> 28:36.510
by a milk herd being
brought back from pasture.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.350
And that's when I noticed it.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.350
- Noticed what?
- The car.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.870
A black Morris Oxford,
it had come off the road.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.910
- Where was this?
- About four miles out of the village.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.670
A couple of miles before the
turn-off for the power station.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.910
What time was this?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.910
About 6:00.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.960
Perhaps a little later.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.510
I suppose I just put it out of my head.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.550
Didn't think any more about it.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.990
- You didn't notice it on
the way in to town? - No.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.750
But the bus had to take a detour on the
way in on account of a tree being down.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.470
How come you remembered it now?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.910
Well, Tristan said the police were
in the village asking questions.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.310
And...

29:15.360 --> 29:16.910
Hello again.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.910
I just popped home for some
lunch. I'm not interrupting?

29:19.960 --> 29:22.990
- Not at all, sir.
- Right.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.240
Well, I'll leave you to it.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.230
Why didn't you report it at the
time, when Dr Laxman went missing?

29:31.280 --> 29:33.710
I don't suppose I put two
and two together at all.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.230
But I don't remember any mention of a car
the first time the police came round.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.070
Sure it was a Friday, though?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.110
I thought so.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.150
Of course, I...

29:43.200 --> 29:46.710
I might be mistaken about when I saw it.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.710
I seem to think it was early autumn.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.350
Certainly before I heard
anything about Dr Laxman.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.590
What was the film that you saw?

29:53.640 --> 29:56.430
- You said you took in a
matinee at the cinema. - Oh.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.470
It was five years ago now.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.110
Um...

30:00.160 --> 30:03.840
I think it was the one about the
borstal boy who becomes a runner.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.920
Right. Thank you, Miss Berger,
that's been most useful.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.630
- They seemed nice, didn't they?
- Yes.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.110
I left some tongue in
the fridge, did you see?

30:17.160 --> 30:18.510
Yes, I did.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.830
- Did you have some?
- Yes.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.520
Was it nice?

30:23.840 --> 30:26.110
- It was quite.
- Good. You're not angry?

30:26.160 --> 30:27.950
Good heavens, no.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.590
You were just doing your duty.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.640
I'm very proud of you.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.680
- When will you be back?
- Late, I should think. Don't wait up.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.070
Do you think it was Laxman's car?

31:14.120 --> 31:16.430
Ask round the garages hereabouts.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.630
See if anyone brought
a Morris in for repair.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.550
You'd think they would have been
spoken to at the time, wouldn't you?

31:22.600 --> 31:24.430
County.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.750
If she even saw what she saw.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.190
Laxman was anti-nuclear.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.350
You think he had something
to do with the power station?

31:35.400 --> 31:37.390
Well, not necessarily.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.670
But it's such a huge staff.
Someone might have seen something.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.750
The problem is, I can't
get access to the site.

31:42.800 --> 31:47.110
Well, I'm due to go out there, interview
the director. A chap called Elliott Blake.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.630
How's that?

31:48.680 --> 31:50.670
Their new reactor, Bramford B.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.630
As soon as Goldenrod becomes
operational this weekend,

31:53.680 --> 31:55.670
we've been invited to bang the drum.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.710
- By whom?
- Blake himself.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.110
He's the darling of the atomic industry.

32:00.160 --> 32:04.790
But there's a lot of bad feeling about their
plans to flood the valley for a reservoir.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.980
How are you with a camera?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.230
- Night, then.
- Want me to give you a lift?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.350
A patrol car can run me.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.470
- What's all this?
- From Morse's place.

32:17.520 --> 32:21.150
Scene of Crime are done with it. Wondered
if he might want some of it back.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.670
- Anything?
- Clean as a whistle.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.460
The only prints they turned up are his.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.480
You all right, sir?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.320
Fine.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.000
Fine.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.990
Dorothea Frazil, Oxford Mail.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.750
I've an appointment with Mr Blake.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.790
My photographer, Snappy Jenkins.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.310
Wait there.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.240
Thank you.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.950
Snappy?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Well, you can be.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.430
Elliott Blake, Director of
Operations. Welcome to Bramford.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.590
- Thank you. - And this is
your photographer, is it?

33:48.640 --> 33:50.230
For today.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.190
But the rest of the time,
he works at the City Police.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.070
Detective Constable Morse.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.990
He tried to get onto the site
to see you without success.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.110
I was told someone from Oxford City
Police had been by -- that was you?

34:02.160 --> 34:03.390
Yes, that was me.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.550
A Dr Matthew Laxman, who
worked at the botanic gardens,

34:06.600 --> 34:09.429
he went missing from the
area around five years ago.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.510
Yes, I remember. What has
that to do with the station?

34:12.560 --> 34:16.230
It appears some of our colleagues at County
failed to question anyone on the site.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.870
Do you remember Matthew
Laxman visiting the station?

34:18.920 --> 34:21.830
Well, we work very closely with
many scientific departments,

34:21.880 --> 34:26.000
but I can't recall ever receiving a
delegation from the botanic gardens.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.440
But you're welcome to join
Miss Frazil for the tour.

35:20.720 --> 35:24.110
Bramford has been in operation
since shortly after the war.

35:24.160 --> 35:28.430
Early work here helped Britain take its
rightful place at the atomic table.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.480
- Keeping up with Uncle Sam?
- And Uncle Joe.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.310
- Please, put these on.
- What is it?

35:34.360 --> 35:36.230
Film badge dosimeter.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.990
Purely a precaution, but
safety is our priority.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.030
- What does it measure?
- Cumulative radiation dose.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.990
Should there be any exposure,
the film will darken.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.960
But don't worry. That won't happen.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.310
Well, that's put my mind at rest.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.860
I suppose Morse told you.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.790
I asked him not to say
anything. He gave me his word.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.830
He kept it.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.360
I told you not to look for me.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.520
You're my daughter. Of
course I'm gonna look for you.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.870
- I didn't come here to row.
- Good.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.880
- Nice place.
- It's all right.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.430
What are you doing for work?

36:36.480 --> 36:38.470
A boutique in Leamington.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.510
Well, what's this? Afternoon off?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.300
Half-day closing.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.800
Who is he?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.110
Why has there always got to be a "he"?

36:56.160 --> 36:58.190
Unless you've started smoking Weights.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.910
Is this what we raised you
to, some bloke's fancy piece?

37:00.960 --> 37:03.350
- He's nice.
- Married? Kids?

37:03.400 --> 37:05.750
- He's gonna leave her.
- That what he told you?

37:05.800 --> 37:08.510
I thought that you said you
didn't come here for a row.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.030
Come home.

37:13.080 --> 37:17.400
This building houses our new
fast breeder reactor, Goldenrod.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.840
It's due to join the
national grid this weekend.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.790
So who was he, this Dr Laxman?

37:28.840 --> 37:31.310
He was a friend of Professor
Bagley. Do you know him?

37:31.360 --> 37:33.990
Bramford probably wouldn't
have existed without him.

37:34.040 --> 37:39.430
Professor Bagley proved vital to Britain's
efforts in developing its own nuclear capability.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.470
Before he lost his way, of course.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.030
How's that?

37:43.080 --> 37:46.190
His wife was with him at
Rumera in the Montebello Islands

37:46.240 --> 37:49.230
for the first British nuclear tests.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.670
Later she developed a
particularly aggressive leukaemia.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.710
And Bagley blamed himself?

37:54.760 --> 37:58.600
When she died, he recanted his
admiration for atomic energy...

37:59.640 --> 38:01.350
.. disavowed his achievements.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.990
That's understandable
in the circumstances.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.710
Perhaps, but...

38:06.080 --> 38:08.070
.. you can't disinvent the wheel.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.840
Please.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.190
Let me show you the control room.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.520
How's Mum?

38:25.280 --> 38:28.150
Half out of her mind with worry.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.430
You could have called just
to set her mind at rest.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.790
I couldn't. She'd have got around me.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.550
- Would that have been the
end of the world? - See?

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
That's why I had to go.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.480
If I come home, what then?

38:44.360 --> 38:46.350
Back to the nine to five?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.110
Tea in front of the telly,

38:48.160 --> 38:52.110
the Saturday dates with some nice boy who
won't try and put his hand up my skirt.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.030
- Joan.
- Is that what you want me to be?

38:55.880 --> 38:59.590
The engagement party, Uncle
Charlie's blue jokes at the wedding,

38:59.640 --> 39:04.150
two-up two-down on some new estate, every
house the same, with a pram in the hall?

39:04.200 --> 39:08.190
Why not? We'd have been glad of
something like that, your mother and me.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.230
You're too young to remember but...

39:10.280 --> 39:13.550
our first two years of married life
after I'd come back from the war,

39:13.600 --> 39:16.910
we lived with your nan and
granddad over the ironmonger's.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.950
Moved into the prefab, we
thought we'd won the pools.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I'm not you and Mum.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.940
And it's not your life, it's mine.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.390
I'm her father.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.400
Right.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.150
Pleased to meet you.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.790
Do you want me to come back?

39:51.840 --> 39:53.830
Take no notice. He's just leaving.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.310
I'm not done here.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.680
Oh, I think you are, mate.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.350
Is this really what you want?

40:15.240 --> 40:16.640
Well...

40:18.960 --> 40:20.960
You've made your bed.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.330
And the radioactive material, is it safe?

40:38.380 --> 40:42.850
Perfectly. More radioactivity comes down
the Thames from Oxford due to the hospitals

40:42.900 --> 40:45.100
than comes out of Bramford.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.130
Goldenrod is controlled by computer,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.690
thus removing the risk of human error.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.890
The latest joint computing nexus model.

40:55.940 --> 40:59.250
Presumably there's a human
fail-safe beyond the computer?

40:59.300 --> 41:01.770
Dr Levin, this is Miss
Frazil of the Oxford Mail

41:01.820 --> 41:04.370
and Detective Constable
Morse of the City Police.

41:04.420 --> 41:09.210
I've been giving them a tour of the facility.
Perhaps you could allay their fears.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.890
Of course. Of course.

41:10.940 --> 41:14.810
Naturally, we do retain a human
fail-safe, based on the SCRAM system.

41:16.420 --> 41:19.610
Don't be alarmed, it's just a test.

41:19.660 --> 41:24.170
I've a few questions about Goldenrod's
contribution to the arms race, Mr Blake.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.890
I'm sure Morse will excuse us.

41:26.940 --> 41:30.610
Dr Levin will be happy to answer
any further questions you may have.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.570
If you could dig out those
visitors' books, I'd appreciate it.

41:33.620 --> 41:34.810
Of course.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.800
As Miss Frazil said,
we've nothing to hide.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.460
Hello, Ray.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.090
Now, look, mate...

41:59.140 --> 42:01.130
I'm not your mate. Get up!

42:01.180 --> 42:03.170
I'll have the bloody law on you!

42:03.220 --> 42:06.420
I am the law. Detective
Inspector Fred Thursday.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.850
589 Lima Foxtrot Tango.

42:09.900 --> 42:13.090
In five minutes, I'll know
everything there is to know about you,

42:13.140 --> 42:15.050
from your home address to your inside leg.

42:15.100 --> 42:17.050
- I'll report you.
- No, you won't.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.250
Come near her again, I'll
fit you up for a nonce

42:19.300 --> 42:22.130
and have you in chokey so fast
you'll wonder what's hit you.

42:22.180 --> 42:24.650
- You can't do that.
- Watch me.

43:00.380 --> 43:02.370
I met your wife the other day,

43:02.420 --> 43:04.650
regarding a Matthew Laxman.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.690
Yes. Yes, she said.

43:06.740 --> 43:10.850
But I'm sure she told you, we've uh...
we've not been in England that long.

43:10.900 --> 43:13.100
And how are you finding it?

43:14.740 --> 43:18.810
There's a lot of misunderstanding amongst
the public when it comes to atomic energy.

43:18.860 --> 43:22.370
On the one hand, the plant has turned
Bramford into a bit of a boom town,

43:22.420 --> 43:25.930
on the other, a cow's milk
turns bad or a bad harvest...

43:25.980 --> 43:27.970
The plant gets the blame.

43:28.020 --> 43:29.770
It's just ignorance.

43:29.820 --> 43:33.050
You wouldn't call Professor
Bagley ignorant, presumably?

43:33.100 --> 43:35.530
- You know Donald?
- Yes, I've met him. Do you?

43:35.580 --> 43:39.770
Sure, sure. Prometheus Unbound was
required reading for any physics major.

43:39.820 --> 43:42.490
He's been a hero to me for
as long as I can recall.

43:42.540 --> 43:46.690
I saw him whenever I came to England.
In fact, I wouldn't be here without him.

43:46.740 --> 43:49.050
- How's that?
- Oh, he gave me a reference.

43:49.100 --> 43:52.180
The name Donald Bagley still
opens doors in Bramford.

43:53.540 --> 43:55.250
When were you in England?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.490
You said you visited Professor Bagley.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.890
Er... winter of '59...

43:59.940 --> 44:02.210
fall of '62 and again in '65.

44:03.300 --> 44:06.730
Fall '62 -- September? It's just,
earlier you said that you...

44:06.780 --> 44:11.170
Oh, I was talking about Ros and me as husband
and wife. We weren't in England then.

44:11.220 --> 44:14.210
So you could have been here
when Laxman disappeared?

44:14.260 --> 44:15.770
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.810
I'd have to check my diary but uh...

44:17.860 --> 44:20.330
Like I said, I never met the guy.

44:26.180 --> 44:28.970
I'm going away at the weekend.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.850
I might not be back for some time.

44:30.900 --> 44:34.770
I wonder... could I leave one or
two things with you for safekeeping?

44:34.820 --> 44:36.610
Of course.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.650
Is everything all right, Donald?

44:38.700 --> 44:41.420
Oh, yes. It will be.

44:47.180 --> 44:49.450
- Just drop me here.
- Are you sure?

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
I need some fresh air.

44:54.740 --> 44:56.170
All well?

44:56.220 --> 44:58.570
You seem a little out of sorts.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.050
My flat was burgled.

45:00.100 --> 45:02.100
Bad luck.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.970
Maybe.

45:06.020 --> 45:08.410
Or maybe someone's trying
to tell me something.

45:08.460 --> 45:10.770
Like what?

45:10.820 --> 45:12.980
"Go west, young man."

45:14.260 --> 45:15.810
Or south.

45:15.860 --> 45:17.850
London, maybe.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.300
A man might lose himself there.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.170
You want to be lost?

45:23.220 --> 45:25.890
Well, might as well make it official.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.250
There's a job in the offing.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.340
What's this -- girl trouble?

45:41.660 --> 45:44.050
I haven't got a girl.

45:44.100 --> 45:46.240
Maybe that's the trouble.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.620
Thanks.

48:06.100 --> 48:09.300
Why didn't you say that
Dr Laxman had come here?

48:09.780 --> 48:12.980
I'd got enough trouble without
being tied up in all that.

48:14.060 --> 48:16.050
They want me gone, don't they?

48:16.100 --> 48:19.610
- Who?
- The power station people.

48:19.660 --> 48:25.170
They want me gone so they can flood
all this and turn it into a reservoir.

48:25.220 --> 48:28.050
Well, I won't go. And they can't make me.

48:28.100 --> 48:30.580
What did he want, Dr Laxman?

48:33.060 --> 48:35.050
I can't remember.

48:35.100 --> 48:39.500
Something to do with the Bram, maybe,
the stream that runs through the valley.

48:40.500 --> 48:44.000
So why did he end up with
a tarot card in his pocket?

48:47.900 --> 48:49.690
I did a reading for him.

48:49.740 --> 48:51.250
And he took it.

48:51.300 --> 48:54.210
That doesn't sound a
particularly nice thing to do.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.770
He wasn't nice.

48:55.820 --> 48:58.620
So, what, he just did it out of mischief?

48:59.460 --> 49:01.410
More spite.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.660
Perhaps he didn't like
what the cards had to say.

49:05.460 --> 49:09.530
Maybe he spoiled the pack because he
thought he could change his future.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.810
Why? What did they predict?

49:11.860 --> 49:14.820
That a woman would bring him to ruin.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.690
I could do a reading for you, if you like.

49:19.740 --> 49:22.250
Oh, no, you're all right. Thank you.

49:22.300 --> 49:25.170
You came here seeking answers, didn't you?

49:32.260 --> 49:37.660
Now... first you must ask
a question of the cards.

49:40.140 --> 49:43.080
Will I find out what
happened to Dr Laxman?

49:45.060 --> 49:47.600
The first card stands for yourself.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.410
No, it's not a bad card.

49:51.460 --> 49:56.490
Ruled by Uranus, The Fool is a
symbol of the soul's journey.

49:56.540 --> 49:58.330
It stands for change.

49:58.380 --> 50:01.180
What can you tell me about Bramford mere?

50:01.260 --> 50:05.850
There are things in the
world older than you know.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.890
We come and go.

50:07.940 --> 50:10.460
But the land endures.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.090
Behind you...

50:14.140 --> 50:16.250
Oh, The Lovers inverted.

50:16.300 --> 50:19.300
- You've been unlucky in love.
- Who hasn't?

50:20.340 --> 50:24.210
There's a maize field about a mile
east of here. Who does it belong to?

50:24.260 --> 50:26.330
Zebulon Sadler. He lives down the lane.

50:26.380 --> 50:30.850
Now, before you... Judgement.

50:30.900 --> 50:32.890
The heart of the matter,

50:32.940 --> 50:35.650
the Tower struck down.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.700
Crossed by...

50:39.700 --> 50:41.340
Don't tell me.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.650
I'm going on a long journey...

50:45.700 --> 50:47.370
by sea, perhaps.

50:47.420 --> 50:49.090
Where I'll meet a tall dark stranger.

50:49.140 --> 50:54.250
Your question will find its answer
but it may not be the one you seek.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.970
And for Capricorns,
tomorrow will be Saturday.

50:57.020 --> 50:59.090
Thank you for your time.

51:00.620 --> 51:02.820
You are going on a journey.

51:04.460 --> 51:07.290
Death waits at the end.

51:07.340 --> 51:09.220
But not for you.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.660
Mr Sadler?

52:21.020 --> 52:24.130
My boy saw it early Sunday morning.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.410
We towed it back to the
barn with a tractor.

52:26.460 --> 52:29.450
- We were gonna sell the parts off.
- And then the balloon went up.

52:29.500 --> 52:32.060
It was his, wasn't it? Dr Laxman's.

52:33.260 --> 52:36.930
So you put it in the barn, covered it in
tarpaulin and it's been there ever since?

52:36.980 --> 52:40.650
We didn't want people thinking we had
anything to do with what happened to him.

52:40.700 --> 52:42.700
We just found the car.

52:47.900 --> 52:49.570
What's that when it's at home?

52:49.620 --> 52:52.650
Meter Survey Radiac No.2. Geiger counter.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.690
What, for radiation and whatnot?

52:54.740 --> 52:56.410
And whatnot, yes.

52:56.460 --> 52:58.060
And this.

53:00.180 --> 53:03.170
There's a scarecrow in your
field wearing Dr Laxman's jacket.

53:03.220 --> 53:05.810
That's what I came to see
you about. Care to explain?

53:05.860 --> 53:07.530
Don't know anything about that.

53:07.580 --> 53:10.450
- It wasn't in his car?
- No.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.290
I don't know where it came from.

53:14.780 --> 53:18.460
Well, I think we'd best carry
this on down the station. Sergeant.

53:19.900 --> 53:21.370
Oh, and there was this.

53:21.420 --> 53:23.410
It's a film badge dosimeter.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.600
It's from Laxman's jacket.

53:26.980 --> 53:28.980
I went to Leamington.

53:37.980 --> 53:40.380
You should have said something.

53:42.100 --> 53:45.980
- What could I have said?
- That you'd seen her, that she was all right.

53:47.580 --> 53:49.130
It wasn't my place.

53:49.180 --> 53:53.260
It wasn't your place to go looking for
her, but you still did, didn't you?

53:56.220 --> 53:57.660
Well...

54:01.780 --> 54:04.180
Maybe we both had a wasted trip.

54:12.420 --> 54:14.960
I found this in Laxman's glove box.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.490
The Grange -- that's Dr Berger's address.

54:20.540 --> 54:22.570
He was away that weekend, wasn't he?

54:22.620 --> 54:25.720
Well, you'd better go and
find out what's what.

54:50.420 --> 54:55.650
I've only got Tristan by way of
male company and he's my brother.

54:55.700 --> 54:58.570
So we had lunch.

54:58.620 --> 55:00.410
- But you knew he was married?
- No.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.450
No, not then.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.800
I think he mentioned it
the second time I saw him.

55:06.260 --> 55:10.970
But he and his wife weren't happy with
each other. She'd found somebody else.

55:11.020 --> 55:14.700
Anyway, I told him I usually go to
the cinema, so we went together.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.770
I let him kiss me.

55:17.820 --> 55:20.130
We arranged to meet again
the following Friday.

55:20.180 --> 55:22.850
- Here?
- That's right.

55:22.900 --> 55:25.410
Tristan was away for the
weekend at a symposium.

55:25.460 --> 55:27.010
I offered to cook supper.

55:27.060 --> 55:29.530
Why on earth didn't you
mention this before?

55:29.580 --> 55:31.690
People talk, especially in Bramford.

55:31.740 --> 55:33.410
- So he came, then?
- Yes.

55:33.460 --> 55:37.700
We ate... and he must
have left about 10:00.

55:38.700 --> 55:40.170
That night?

55:41.660 --> 55:43.730
It was Saturday morning.

55:46.020 --> 55:49.810
So all of that business about seeing
his car on the Friday, what was that?

55:49.860 --> 55:54.460
I saw it early on the Sunday morning when
I went to pick up Tristan from the station.

56:18.020 --> 56:20.650
Friend of Miss Berger's, is it?

56:20.700 --> 56:22.660
I'm sorry?

56:23.660 --> 56:25.490
What's your business up here?

56:25.540 --> 56:27.730
Police business. Yours?

56:27.780 --> 56:29.170
I saw the car.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.410
Seth Chattox, I'm just down the lane.

56:31.460 --> 56:33.810
I keep an eye for her when
Dr Berger's working late.

56:33.860 --> 56:36.050
Is that right? Have you known them long?

56:36.100 --> 56:38.090
Ever since they moved here.

56:38.140 --> 56:40.890
Eight years ago now, I think.

56:40.940 --> 56:45.050
Is it you I saw with another fellow on a road by
the lower pasture the other day? He had a hat.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.370
- Yes, that's right.
- What were you doing there?

56:47.420 --> 56:50.250
There was the sighting of a
car, went missing five years ago,

56:50.300 --> 56:52.290
belonged to a Dr Matthew Laxman.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.130
I don't suppose you saw it?

56:54.180 --> 56:55.690
No.

56:55.740 --> 56:57.740
I can't say as I did.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.490
Is that what all the police are doing
down by the mere, looking for him?

57:02.540 --> 57:04.690
Yes. That's right.

57:04.740 --> 57:06.880
Well, good luck with that.

57:10.340 --> 57:12.340
Away, Kip.

57:52.780 --> 57:55.620
11:00am, eighth floor, Tintagel House.

57:57.660 --> 57:59.650
Thank you, sir.

57:59.700 --> 58:02.530
Look forward to meeting you.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.050
Thank you.

58:12.220 --> 58:13.700
Oh.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.530
Fetched you a rabbit, Grandma.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.570
Oh, put it in the kitchen.

58:18.620 --> 58:20.610
- There's tea in the pot.
- Right.

58:20.660 --> 58:23.530
I saw that copper you said about... Morse.

58:23.580 --> 58:26.170
- Where's this?
- Up by The Grange.

58:26.220 --> 58:28.290
You want to keep clear of the Bergers.

58:28.340 --> 58:30.340
Him and her both.

58:32.980 --> 58:35.980
There's nothing for the
likes of us up there.

58:37.540 --> 58:38.980
Hear me?

58:40.380 --> 58:42.450
I'll chop you some logs.

58:48.380 --> 58:52.770
I'm afraid I have no idea what Matthew
would have wanted with a Geiger counter.

58:52.820 --> 58:54.410
Really?

58:54.460 --> 58:56.860
He never discussed it with you?

58:58.500 --> 59:00.610
He never mentioned the power station?

59:00.660 --> 59:03.530
He wouldn't have. He knew better.

59:03.580 --> 59:06.250
Having been midwife to the devil,

59:06.300 --> 59:08.690
Bramford's rather a sore point with me.

59:08.740 --> 59:10.210
Progress, sir.

59:10.260 --> 59:12.820
Oh. Yes, you think so?

59:14.300 --> 59:16.500
Well, I suppose I did, too.

59:17.300 --> 59:19.290
Can I offer you a sherry?

59:19.340 --> 59:22.650
Er... no, thank you, sir.
That's all I came to ask.

59:22.700 --> 59:25.050
I'd best get home.

59:25.100 --> 59:26.690
Are you married, Inspector?

59:26.740 --> 59:28.730
Yes, sir, 26 years.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.260
Oh. Same as Anne and me.

59:38.420 --> 59:40.410
Goodnight, then, sir.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.460
Goodnight.

59:51.100 --> 59:52.250
Home.

59:52.300 --> 59:54.290
Fred, Joan's rang.

59:54.340 --> 59:55.810
She's all right.

59:55.860 --> 59:59.810
She said she's fine and she's
settled and everything's all right.

59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.850
She didn't say where.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.610
And I didn't ask about coming home
because I didn't want to push it.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.460
But she said she'd ring again next week.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.210
That's a relief, eh?

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.780
Yeah.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.290
Yeah, that's erm...

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.450
Yeah.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.500
I'm going to have a
Mackeson's to celebrate.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.140
Evening, sir. I wondered
if you had a moment.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.800
It's about my sergeant's exam.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.050
I've been thinking about what you said.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.170
About me leaving Oxford.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:53.020
You're right, there's nothing
to keep me here. No family.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.100
I've been offered to join
a new unit in London.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.420
It means rank.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.660
Well...

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.890
It goes without saying, we shall
miss your abilities, but...

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.490
you must do what you think right.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.610
For an officer of your talent
to remain at detective constable

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.010
would be a waste of material.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.410
Believe me, Morse, I've
seen it all too often.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.660
Better men passed over in favour of
mediocrity because they weren't... club.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.090
So you think I should take it?

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.810
That's a matter entirely for you.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.570
If you'll forgive the presumption,

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:41.300
you're a man, I think, more used to putting
the concerns of others before himself.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.500
Perhaps in this instance, you should
consider what's in your own best interests.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.660
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.730
Do you want to come in?

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.780
Yeah.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.450
It's not how I imagined.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.330
Where is he?

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.890
- Where is he?
- It wasn't his fault, it was me.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.260
- Don't say that.
- Morse, please, it was me. I provoked him.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.420
He's erm...

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.920
.. given me a couple of
weeks to get out of the flat.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.570
You should go home.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.890
- I can't.
- Of course you can.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.940
I can't.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.900
I've made such a mess.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.450
I don't know what to do.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.820
Marry me.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.220
Morse, I...

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.700
I don't want your pity.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.640
Never mind what Dad would say.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.170
I've been offered a job
in London, the Met.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.210
Tintagel House.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:59.140
I've got to meet a detective inspector over
there on Monday, but it's just a formality.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.300
London?

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.340
How did Dad take it?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.980
I'll drop him a line.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.810
Well, if you...

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.600
If you're not gonna go home, then er...

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.170
Just... take this.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.290
- I can't take all that.
- You might need it.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.280
Please, just take it.

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.080
Well, you'll get it back.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.740
- Could be work.
- It wouldn't be anything else.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.410
Morse?

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.130
Evening, matey, it's Jim.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.170
There's been a development.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.570
Can you just wait a minute?
Where are you going?

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.210
Erm...

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.970
to get my things.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:38.290
You're not going back to him?

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.290
The Met?

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.140
You there, Morse?

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.580
Say farewell for me.

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.100
Morse?

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.810
That badge you found, the dosimeter.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.730
We've had it developed.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.770
The lab says it's been exposed
to a high dose of radiation.

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.810
Did Laxman go to the power station?

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.400
The Director of Operations said no.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.650
Right, Mr Sadler.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.900
Tell them the same as you
told me about the coat.

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.370
I got it off Seth Chattox, didn't I?

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.610
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.650
I didn't want to get him into trouble.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.690
But if it's this dead fella's
jacket, that's different, ain't it?

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:46.730
I ain't gonna get done for
murder on nobody's account.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.250
Where? Where was this?

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.040
Down Bramford mere, by the water there.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.450
♪ Hey!

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.460
♪ Hey!

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.450
♪ Hey!

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:42.939
Start digging here.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.090
Looks like we've found Dr Laxman.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.899
What the bloody hell's this now?

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:56.490
It's the autumnal equinox.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.970
They want to come and observe the sunrise.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.740
Just keep them away from here. We'll
go and have a talk with this shepherd.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:21.090
.. be sure of a bounteous harvest,

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.460
and bless us with all good
things throughout the coming year.

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.780
Sergeant!

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.370
What were you doing with Laxman's jacket?

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.770
I found it under a hedge up by the
woods, by the Americans' cottage.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.890
So why didn't you report it at the time?

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:11.810
I find all sorts up the woods. I didn't
know anyone was missing when I picked it up.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:17.050
I would have kept it myself, only it
didn't fit. It was too small for me.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.770
I was off to taking it up the church
jumble only I ran into Zebulon.

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.120
He thought it might do for
Old Job, the scarecrow.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.130
- Where'd you find Sadler?
- Didn't he say?

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.650
Up by Bramford mere.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.770
Why were you there at
that time of the morning?

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.650
I was after a ewe that got loose.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:36.850
They like it down the mere for the
clover, only it don't do them no good.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.850
Was she down there, the ewe?

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.970
No.

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.290
I must have missed the bugger in the dark.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.770
By the time I got up to the
top field, there she was.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.820
Innocent as you please.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.570
- Is it him?
- Most certainly.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.210
I could recite his dental
records from memory.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.050
It's Matthew Laxman, no question.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.370
Cause?

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.130
There's a wound to the skull not unlike that
on the other one you pulled out of the bog.

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:14.730
At some point, he was exposed to
a fairly large dose of radiation.

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.410
Enough to be fatal?

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.090
Enough that I'll be ordering
him a lead-lined coffin.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.940
The ground readings are abnormally high.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.090
♪ Hey!

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.220
♪ Hey!

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.730
♪ Hey!

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.770
Mrs Levin? City Police.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.490
We were hoping to have a
word with your husband.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:39.050
You missed him. He went to
the plant about an hour ago.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.130
With?

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.850
A white-haired gentleman
and a tall man with a beard.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.280
Jon said they were colleagues.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.960
Very early for the emergency drill.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.410
- Has Dr Levin checked in?
- About an hour ago.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.010
Who was in the car with him?

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.850
Professor Bagley and Dr Warren,
the Professor's colleague.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.530
- Where's Mr Blake?
- In the control room. This is a drill.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.970
- This isn't a drill. Open the gate.
- I can't, sir.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.610
I'm not asking, I'm ordering.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.660
This could be sabotage.
Now, what's it to be?

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.090
- Right, sir.
- Lend us your sidearm.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.600
Help with the evacuation.
Good work, Sergeant.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.810
"And the second angel sounded.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.890
And as though it were a great mountain
burning with fire, it was cast into the sea.

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.490
- And the third part of the sea..."
- Please think about what you're doing.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.650
Believe me, Blake, I've thought
of nothing else for years.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.610
Don, please. You're a physicist.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.650
Physics.

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.090
Science.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.130
We're just children playing with matches.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:29.970
And for what? To find more efficient ways
of turning our fellow human beings into ash?

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.490
- That's what this is really about.
- Don, please.

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.250
Goldenrod harvesting plutonium.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.530
Professor Bagley, it's Detective
Constable Morse. I'm unarmed.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.610
I'm unarmed. Put your weapon down.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.050
He's trying to purge the cooling ponds.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.780
Tell him why.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.940
There was a leak six years ago.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.370
Tell him. Tell him!

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.810
A leak of radioactive material from
the cooling ponds at Bramford A,

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.730
where spent uranium rods were stored.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.370
- So what happened?
- Human error.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.850
Instead of drawing water,

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.730
hundreds and thousands of gallons
were purged from the ponds.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.650
- And entered the groundwater?
- He's doing the same thing now.

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.410
They tried to hush it up, of course,

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.930
but Matthew Laxman had been monitoring
the area round Bramford for years.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.210
He threatened the status quo
so he had to be silenced.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.370
They buried the truth about that
leak but they won't bury this one.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.770
You're wrong. Laxman wasn't
killed by anyone here.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.210
- He's lying, Donald.
They're all liars. - No.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.570
- Then who? - I don't know. But
I want justice for Laxman too.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.090
Please. Just think about
what you're doing.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.890
- This is justice for Matt.
- No, it's not.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.650
I was with him the day he went missing.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.890
He went down to the mere to take
readings and said he'd pick me up later.

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.370
But he never made it back,
because these bastards killed him.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.490
And you're protecting them,
but we will have justice.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.250
An eye for an eye.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.170
Don't try anything.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.810
You watched your wife die, Professor.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.890
Do you really mean to poison the land,

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.010
and condemn hundreds, maybe
thousands, to the same fate?

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.050
Don't listen to him, Donald.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:02.250
The world will take what happens here as
a warning and step back from the brink.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.770
Maybe. But people will still die.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.340
Old, young, men, women and children.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.330
All of them loved by someone.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.620
The same as you loved your
wife, the same as I love mine.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.170
I'd like to go home to her
right now, if I'm honest,

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.560
walk away and leave you to it.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.340
But I can't.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.620
So...

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.320
.. if you really want
to go through with it...

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.970
.. you're gonna have to shoot me.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.500
I'll do it.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.420
Maybe.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.980
But I'm hoping you're the Donald Bagley that
dedicated the last 20 years of his life to peace.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.650
I'm sorry.

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.170
- Levin, can you stop...
- Get away from there, Doctor.

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.690
Judas! I believed in you!

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.140
You think I've come this far...

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.740
I'm the fail-safe, remember?

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.420
If you shoot me... everybody dies.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.660
- Stop! Stop.
- Out of my way.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.090
You're done.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.650
Now...

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.020
.. we all walk out of
here nice and quietly.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.970
♪ Hey!

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.370
.. if the reactor had
gone into... Sergeant!

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.450
Can't you keep that animal quiet?

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.450
It's all right, sir.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.250
He's a bit like our Chief Superintendent,
I expect -- bark worse than his bite.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.940
Sir.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.690
Right.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.740
Back to the nick.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.500
Morse?

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.860
Can I take a look at your
crook, please, Mr Chattox?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.130
First time I met you,
your dog was chewing this.

01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.810
Well, it's a habit.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.690
I tried to break him of it but...

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.610
We pulled a pair of
spectacles from Bramford mere,

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.660
chewed the same way.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.370
Dr Laxman's glasses.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.650
Is that right?

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.300
You were in love with Selina Berger.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.460
The minute I saw her.

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:25.210
She'd go up ahead of her brother to
get the place ready for him and...

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.330
Well, she seemed lonely.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.540
A man gets an idea.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:36.220
I mean, she had a brother, but a
brother's not a husband, is it?

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:40.170
- I asked her to marry me.
- Only she turned you down.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.770
It was her right.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.290
But she didn't turn down Matthew Laxman.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.010
- You were jealous.
- Not like that.

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.490
I just wanted her to be happy but...

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.290
Laxman was a wrong 'un. I could see that
from the off and she deserved better.

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.010
You thought she deserved you.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.610
Well, I would've looked after her.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.660
I don't doubt it.

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.530
Quick with a back-hander, he was.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.250
But that's not a man.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.010
Not to my way of thinking.

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:13.160
So you came across his car after
it had been run off the road.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.410
Cos that's the way you take
your sheep to the top field.

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.290
I offered to help him too.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.330
I went to get my car to tow him out.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:25.370
By the time I got back, he was still wild about
being run off the road by the plant truck.

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.620
Effing and jeffing, he was.

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:32.450
Started trying to tell me how to tie a
bowline, how I was doing it all wrong.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.810
Me? I said, "I don't need no
advice from you on tying knots."

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:37.850
He said, "That's not what I heard."

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:40.450
I said to him... I said,
"What's that supposed to mean?"

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.210
And he said, "I tell you this.

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.860
You don't know what you're missing."

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.850
One punch.

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.850
That's all it was, just one.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.620
So you buried his body at Bramford mere?

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.970
If I hadn't gone to help him...

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.020
he'd still be alive.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.700
The turn of the year.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.970
I don't suppose you'd give me a
minute to do for Kip, would you?

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.890
He won't understand not seeing me.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.340
Wait!

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.540
We'll look to him.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.940
Hard... to leave the land.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.140
Better to die under an
open sky than prison.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.380
Some men aren't born for walls.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.660
Joan rang.

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:05.660
I think that's all her
mother wanted, really.

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.480
Just to hear her voice...

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.280
.. know she was all right.

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.140
No. Thanks.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.920
I'll see you Monday, then.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.850
Monday, Morse.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.100
Handshakes are for goodbye.

01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:57.490
"A small fire in a storage area was quickly
contained by Bramford's own fire brigade,

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.850
with the site suffering
only the most minor damage.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.890
No members of staff were injured

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.480
and there was never at any time...

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.170
.. a danger to the public."

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.930
And they all lived happily ever after.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.810
In the Mail, Thursday.

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.170
I hope you wouldn't gainsay Miss Frazil.

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.620
More than my life's worth, sir.

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.400
There was one more thing.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.140
I have today received a letter.

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.380
Morse.

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:11.850
It was a bad fall.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.770
Will she be all right?

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:18.520
We've given her something to
help her sleep, that's all.

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.170
Just one of those things.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.730
Mother Nature.

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.980
Still, she's young and fit.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.410
Give it a month or two, I'm
sure you'll be able to try again.

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.600
Better luck next time, hm?

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.890
"Dear Chief Superintendent Bright.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.050
I'm instructed to inform you
