11:35.274 --> 11:38.174
<i>The pump, it made a click,</i>
<i>and I got scared.</i>

11:38.241 --> 11:40.274
I looked down,
and then I heard the shots.

11:40.341 --> 11:42.208
The shots?
Yes.

11:42.274 --> 11:45.074
<i>And when I looked back up,</i>
<i>he was shooting.</i>

11:45.141 --> 11:47.241
This man?

11:47.308 --> 11:49.774
<i>That man.</i>
What did you do then?

11:49.841 --> 11:52.274
I ducked behind my car
and I hid.

11:52.341 --> 11:54.874
<i>The next thing,</i>
<i>I heard his footsteps.</i>

11:54.941 --> 11:57.541
- I think he ran by the car.
- Then what?

11:57.608 --> 12:01.241
Then I ran inside the store.
The attendant was lying there,
blood all over.

12:01.308 --> 12:04.041
- <i>[ Rebecca ] Oh, God!</i>
- Ms. Washington,

12:04.108 --> 12:08.608
are you sure that that's
the man you saw shoot and kill
Roberto Alou that evening?

12:08.674 --> 12:10.641
That's the man.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.141
I'm positive.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.908
- You're gonna--
- Don't.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.508
Where's the U.S. Attorney?

12:28.574 --> 12:31.141
John Dix,
he didn't, uh, oppose.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.774
- I'm doing this ex parte.
- Sit down.

12:36.241 --> 12:39.808
<i>You've been cited 11 times,</i>
<i>Mr. Peabody.</i>

12:39.874 --> 12:44.808
Your Honor, my client feels
the congressional legislation
works a hardship against him.

12:44.874 --> 12:48.708
Moreover, we feel his toilet
would be grandfathered,
and therefore exempt.

12:48.774 --> 12:51.441
The report indicates
it's a new toilet.

12:51.508 --> 12:55.041
But it's the same residence
where he's resided for 27--

12:55.108 --> 12:58.274
The law goes to new toilets,
counsel-- any new toilet.

12:58.341 --> 13:01.941
<i>1.6 gallons per flush,</i>
<i>that's the law.</i>

13:02.008 --> 13:04.608
Why should you
get three?

13:04.674 --> 13:07.708
Your Honor, my client
has special needs.

13:10.741 --> 13:13.141
- Big?
- I beg your pardon?

13:13.208 --> 13:15.441
His bowel movements,
are they big?

13:17.208 --> 13:20.341
I'd prefer not to get into it.
But rather, I'd like to focus...

13:20.408 --> 13:23.041
on the legislative intent
of the law, which was
water conservation.

13:23.108 --> 13:27.708
The older, standard toilets
used 3.6 gallons per flush.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.141
The new go 1.6,
as you've noted.

13:30.208 --> 13:34.408
However, if a person were
required to flush three times...

13:34.474 --> 13:37.808
in order to empty
the bowl of all... remains,

13:37.874 --> 13:42.841
the statutory intent
of the legislation
would clearly be undermined.

13:42.908 --> 13:47.441
It is for this reason we feel
special circumstances warrant
Mr. Peabody's exemption.

13:49.608 --> 13:51.708
You have to flush
three times?

13:51.774 --> 13:54.141
Uh, it's-- it's not
because of bigness.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.508
May I ask?

13:56.574 --> 13:59.241
They float.

14:00.408 --> 14:02.241
They float?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.541
Yeah. I eat a lot
of carbohydrates,

14:04.608 --> 14:06.974
and it makes my droppings
like little-- little buoys.

14:07.041 --> 14:10.708
And the 1.6 flush
can't pull 'em under,

14:10.774 --> 14:12.741
unless I'm
real careful and--

14:12.808 --> 14:14.941
and kinda drape
the toilet paper over 'em,

14:15.008 --> 14:17.174
which creates
this drag effect.

14:17.241 --> 14:19.941
I see.
It takes
at least three flushes.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.574
And then even sometimes
when I think it's gone-- Boom!

14:22.641 --> 14:24.741
A little one
floats back up.

14:24.808 --> 14:27.374
The situation becomes
exacerbated, Your Honor,

14:27.441 --> 14:32.874
by the fact that after
three flushes, the toilet
needs time to... rejuvenate.

14:32.941 --> 14:36.508
Sometimes as much as 10 minutes
before it's capable
of flushing again.

14:36.574 --> 14:39.874
There have been situations
where my client
has had company...

14:39.941 --> 14:42.308
and he's been too embarrassed
to leave the bathroom...

14:42.374 --> 14:45.308
for fear of the company then
coming in and, well, seeing--

14:45.374 --> 14:47.908
- A floatie.
- A floatie.

14:50.674 --> 14:52.708
[ Grunts ]

14:54.641 --> 14:57.374
[ Ellenor ]
My client is being
unfairly singled out.

14:57.441 --> 15:01.508
<i>And never mind</i>
<i>selective prosecution,</i>
<i>this is double jeopardy.</i>

15:01.574 --> 15:04.508
It isn't double jeopardy.
It's a different charge
under a different statute.

15:04.574 --> 15:08.108
He's being prosecuted again
for the same act.
He stole a purse.

15:08.174 --> 15:12.141
This is not unprecedented.
Defendants are prosecuted under
federal civil rights charges...

15:12.208 --> 15:14.308
all the time
for state crimes.

15:14.374 --> 15:17.908
What's more, this defendant
is not being prosecuted
just for the latest theft.

15:17.974 --> 15:20.808
It's for all his purse
snatching, three of which
have involved tourists.

15:20.874 --> 15:24.441
This is a political arrest
designed to make a statement
in the papers. How can--

15:25.641 --> 15:28.174
The law is the law, counsel.

15:28.241 --> 15:31.974
<i>And crimes against tourists</i>
<i>affect interstate commerce.</i>

15:32.041 --> 15:34.108
We take that particular law
very seriously.

15:34.174 --> 15:36.674
<i>Now, I'll grant</i>
<i>the personal.</i>

15:36.741 --> 15:39.308
But the charge
absolutely stands.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.541
Judge Winchell is believed
to rule as soon as tomorrow.

15:45.608 --> 15:49.441
If given time, Congressman Haley
would presumably face expulsion
from the House.

15:49.508 --> 15:52.441
You know,
when I was in law school
I wanted to clerk for her.

15:52.508 --> 15:54.308
I couldn't
even get an interview.

15:54.374 --> 15:56.474
Well, you've met her now.
I only pray she'll forget.

15:56.541 --> 15:59.241
Well, if she took it under
advisement, you'll probably
have to go in again.

15:59.308 --> 16:01.408
I'm goin' back there.
To the cleaners?

16:01.474 --> 16:04.674
I can't let him get away
with it. I took the high road
first and just walked away,

16:04.741 --> 16:07.808
but I can't let a man
ruin my shirt, call me fat,
and then just walk away.

16:07.874 --> 16:11.474
- Eugene, you can't hit him.
- I'm not gonna hit him! Why do
you always say "don't hit"?

16:11.541 --> 16:13.808
Because you hit.

16:13.874 --> 16:16.241
I'm gonna go back there calm,

16:16.308 --> 16:18.408
let him know that
I'm an attorney at law...

16:18.474 --> 16:22.408
and that I can make it very
expensive for him if he doesn't
give me satisfaction.

16:22.474 --> 16:24.574
[ Door Opens ]
He'll hit him.

16:26.808 --> 16:31.474
Ms. Washington,
did you see my client
while you were in the store?

16:31.541 --> 16:34.241
Not really.
<i>You see anybody else</i>
<i>in the store?</i>

16:34.308 --> 16:36.308
- I don't think so.
- You're not sure?

16:36.374 --> 16:39.041
I just paid the money and told
the attendant which pump.

16:39.108 --> 16:41.441
Okay. Can you describe
what the attendant looked like?

16:41.508 --> 16:43.474
No.

16:43.541 --> 16:46.441
<i>After you paid him,</i>
<i>you went outside?</i>
Yes.

16:46.508 --> 16:48.474
To pump gas?
Yes.

16:48.541 --> 16:52.141
Were you looking at your car
as you walked to the car or were
you looking at the store?

16:52.208 --> 16:54.141
I was probably
looking at my car.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.941
- You don't know for sure?
- No.

16:57.008 --> 17:00.974
So you don't know if anybody
else entered or exited the store
while you headed for your car.

17:01.041 --> 17:03.408
I didn't see anybody else
go in or go out.

17:03.474 --> 17:06.340
But you weren't
looking at the door.
Right.

17:06.407 --> 17:08.273
Is it possible somebody else
could have gone in...

17:08.340 --> 17:10.273
that door while you were
walking towards your car?

17:10.340 --> 17:14.773
I didn't see any--
The question was
is it possible?

17:15.708 --> 17:18.108
Anything's possible.

17:18.174 --> 17:20.473
You sound annoyed.
Are you annoyed
with these questions?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.241
- Objection.
- Sustained.

17:24.241 --> 17:27.674
When you heard the shots,
you-- you looked up.

17:27.741 --> 17:29.708
You say you saw my client?

17:29.774 --> 17:31.741
Yes.
<i>What was he wearing?</i>

17:31.808 --> 17:33.741
This big jacket with a hood.

17:33.808 --> 17:36.608
A hood.
Was this hood up?

17:36.674 --> 17:38.941
Yes.
<i>Big hood, little hood?</i>

17:39.008 --> 17:41.608
- Big hood.
- <i>Did it cover any part</i>
of his face?

17:41.674 --> 17:46.241
- The side maybe. Not the front.
- And how far away from the
store were these gas pumps?

17:46.308 --> 17:51.741
- Maybe 30 feet.
- Well, if I were
to tell you 42 feet--

17:51.808 --> 17:55.874
- Okay.
- You saw him from
42 feet away?

17:55.941 --> 17:58.941
- Yes.
- With a hood partially
blocking his face?

17:59.008 --> 18:02.141
I saw the front of his face.

18:02.208 --> 18:06.274
Ms. Washington,
you, uh, seem like an advocate.

18:06.341 --> 18:08.941
[ Jean ] Objection!
[ Judge ] Sustained.

18:09.008 --> 18:12.341
You said he was pointing the gun
the first time you saw him?

18:12.408 --> 18:14.474
Yes.
And then he was
shooting the gun?

18:14.541 --> 18:18.341
- That's right.
- Did you ever get
a close look at his face...

18:18.408 --> 18:22.141
while he was not pointing
or shooting a gun?
I don't think so.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.374
And when you heard the shot,
were you frightened?

18:24.441 --> 18:28.074
- Well, yes.
- You looked up, you saw a man
shooting another man.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.074
Were you shocked?
I suppose I was.

18:30.141 --> 18:34.941
After the shooting, the police
came and you gave a description.
Yes.

18:35.008 --> 18:37.441
You described the man
as Hispanic?
Yes.

18:37.508 --> 18:41.474
- <i>You were sure he was Hispanic?</i>
- I thought he was Hispanic.

18:41.541 --> 18:44.808
Well, did you say "I think he
was Hispanic, but I'm not sure"?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.774
Did you say that?
Yes, but when I saw him--

18:46.841 --> 18:50.241
You said you weren't sure.
I was sure when I saw him again
in the lineup.

18:50.308 --> 18:53.941
And when you saw him
in the lineup, was he wearing
a jacket with a big hood?

18:54.008 --> 18:58.641
- I think so.
- And when the police showed you
mug shots before this lineup,

18:58.708 --> 19:01.074
<i>were you able to identify</i>
<i>any of these people</i>
<i>in the photographs...</i>

19:01.141 --> 19:03.374
as the man who did
that shooting?

19:03.441 --> 19:05.774
No.

19:05.841 --> 19:08.908
Were you shown a picture
of my client?

19:10.441 --> 19:12.508
I don't think I was.

19:12.574 --> 19:14.908
You were.

19:16.974 --> 19:20.208
<i>And... that's him...</i>

19:20.274 --> 19:23.241
right there...
without the hood.

19:38.608 --> 19:42.674
One judge says no jail.
Then another judge say
I gotta go on trial? Again?

19:42.741 --> 19:44.574
Let's not panic just yet,
okay, Warren?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.574
Ellenor, I used to
scam banks back when.

19:46.641 --> 19:48.408
And this is my reward
for scaling down?

19:48.474 --> 19:50.508
Okay, well, you see,

- Couple of seconds.

19:54.808 --> 19:56.874

19:56.941 --> 19:59.874
Why don't you just sit down.
Wait here.

20:04.908 --> 20:06.974
I'm afraid you have
stepped into it a little.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.108
What do you mean?
Off the record?

20:09.174 --> 20:10.974
Absolutely.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.008
They have been
waiting for this case.

20:13.074 --> 20:15.474
Tourism is a billion-dollar
industry here.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.874
Foreign tourists have been
getting spooked about crime.

20:17.941 --> 20:19.908
Not so much here in Boston,
but even so--

20:19.974 --> 20:23.108
So my little purse snatcher's
the one you go after?
He's the perfect guy.

20:23.174 --> 20:25.941
Petty crime,
that shows zero tolerance.

20:26.008 --> 20:28.008
Now, you didn't
hear this from me,

20:28.074 --> 20:30.208
but don't you dare plead
guilty, banking on leniency.

20:30.274 --> 20:33.108
<i>Get your sentence up front</i>
<i>or go to trial.</i>

20:33.174 --> 20:35.908
- What could he get?
- Up to 20.

20:37.874 --> 20:39.908
Twenty years
for snatching a purse?

20:39.974 --> 20:43.608
- The problem is
he gave one back.
- Excuse me?

20:43.674 --> 20:45.441
Last year he grabbed
some lady's purse,

20:45.508 --> 20:47.908
and when he saw her
local address, he gave it back,

20:47.974 --> 20:50.441
saying something like,
"You're from Boston".

20:50.508 --> 20:55.708
Now that's the pole
they'll be driving
to show he targets tourists.

20:55.774 --> 21:00.308
As I said, you have
stepped into it pretty good.

21:09.308 --> 21:11.341
Don't shrink shirt!

21:11.408 --> 21:14.274
Mr. Wong,
I'm not going to debate
the merits of this dispute.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.741
<i>What I came to say is,</i>
<i>despite the merits,</i>

21:16.808 --> 21:19.441
it will cost you money
not to give me satisfaction.

21:19.508 --> 21:21.408
You get fatter.
That problem.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.841
Mr. Wong, I'm an attorney.

21:24.908 --> 21:28.741
I will draft a complaint,
notice a deposition in my
office, and I will see to it...

21:28.808 --> 21:32.941
that you have to sit in my
office for a full day, maybe
two, to answer my questions.

21:33.008 --> 21:37.074
Should you have an attorney--
and it would be my objective
opinion that you should--

21:37.141 --> 21:40.408
this, together
with loss of business,
could be extremely costly.

21:40.474 --> 21:43.908
Much more expensive, say,
than replacing my shirt.

21:44.874 --> 21:47.541
You sue 'cause you big?

21:47.608 --> 21:50.308
Yes.
I will sue you.

21:50.374 --> 21:52.941
Not fair.
What's not fair
is you shrinking my shirt.

21:53.008 --> 21:54.341
No shrink!
Yes, shrink!

21:54.408 --> 21:57.774

against my client?
- No.

22:23.774 --> 22:28.841
So it's your testimony
you've got no bias whatsoever
against Luis Moreno?

22:28.908 --> 22:32.141
Well, when I see somebody
commit murder,

22:32.208 --> 22:34.608
it can make me
not like them, yes.
Mm-hmm.

22:34.674 --> 22:36.774
And if that person
did not commit murder,

22:36.841 --> 22:40.008
the bias, like any prejudice,
would be grounded in
ignorance, correct?

22:40.074 --> 22:42.008
- Objection.
- <i>[ Seymour ]</i>
Withdrawn.

22:42.074 --> 22:44.974

- <i>That make you angry?</i>
- <i>Yes, it did.</i>

22:56.574 --> 22:59.874

35:25.494 --> 35:27.761
They showed her his picture.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.894
She didn't recognize him.

35:29.961 --> 35:35.094
<i>It's only when he appeared</i>
<i>with the big hood.</i>

35:35.161 --> 35:37.928
Now, can anybody here--

35:37.994 --> 35:42.494
anybody--
trust that recognition?

35:42.561 --> 35:44.894
And even if you could,

35:46.828 --> 35:49.161
beyond all reasonable doubt?

36:03.961 --> 36:06.261
The defense made a mistake.

36:07.794 --> 36:12.561
Chipping away
at reasonable doubt,
that was a credible strategy.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.528
Nighttime crime,
happened in a flash--
reasonable doubt.

36:15.594 --> 36:19.128
It's a very plausible defense.

36:19.194 --> 36:22.328
But then he argued bias.

36:22.394 --> 36:25.528
<i>Rebecca Washington</i>
<i>was indebted</i>
<i>to the prosecution.</i>

36:25.594 --> 36:28.794
<i>Rebecca Washington</i>
<i>was prejudiced</i>
<i>against the defendant.</i>

36:28.861 --> 36:32.428
Now that was a mistake.

36:34.494 --> 36:39.394
Because you saw the woman
sitting in this witness chair.

36:39.461 --> 36:42.094
And you know as I do,

36:42.161 --> 36:44.661
if anything came through
beyond all doubt,

36:44.728 --> 36:47.961
it's that sitting in this
chair was an honest woman...

36:48.028 --> 36:50.261
<i>whose integrity</i>
<i>was unassailable.</i>

36:50.328 --> 36:53.394
<i>Yes, she was threatened</i>
<i>by the brother,</i>

36:53.461 --> 36:57.661
told there'd be
consequences if she got up
at the probable cause hearing.

36:57.728 --> 37:01.328
But she got up
at probable cause.

37:01.394 --> 37:05.794
And she got up here
and told the truth.

37:05.861 --> 37:11.428
Can we be sure
that that's the man
who killed Roberto Alou?

37:13.094 --> 37:16.394
Yes.
How can we be sure?

37:16.461 --> 37:20.861
Because that woman
right over there
told you so.

37:20.928 --> 37:25.128
If she wasn't sure,
she would have told you that.

37:25.194 --> 37:29.694
She saw him in that store--
a well-lit store.

37:29.761 --> 37:31.528
She saw him
pull that trigger,

37:31.594 --> 37:36.061
and she saw him the next day
in that lineup.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.628
She forged ahead
through threats,

37:39.694 --> 37:41.794
through not-so-great odds,

37:41.861 --> 37:43.728
through defense attorney
attacks...

37:43.794 --> 37:45.828
to do one thing--

37:45.894 --> 37:49.161
to bring the truth
to the 12 of you.

37:50.194 --> 37:53.194
And who here
didn't see that?

38:01.494 --> 38:04.728
You expect me to dismiss
because you don't like the law?

38:04.794 --> 38:07.994
I expect you to dismiss
because as a judge
you should be offended...

38:08.061 --> 38:11.994
- by Congress using the law
for political expedience.
- Welcome to America.

38:12.061 --> 38:15.194
Is that what I'm supposed
to say to my client?
"Welcome to America"?

38:15.261 --> 38:17.994
"Tourism is big business,
so you're goin' away
for 20 years"?

38:18.061 --> 38:21.761
Maybe you should tell
your client that he's a thief.

38:21.828 --> 38:23.961
<i>He preys on people.</i>

38:24.028 --> 38:26.961
Why should I give a rat's ass
about fairness to him?

38:27.028 --> 38:30.428
Did he care about
those two women in their 80s
that he stole from?

38:30.494 --> 38:32.894
Then make the punishment
proportional to the crime.

38:32.961 --> 38:34.894
In my opinion, it is.

38:34.961 --> 38:37.161
<i>I am sick and tired...</i>

38:37.228 --> 38:40.461
of these hoodlums getting
fourth, fifth and sixth chances.

38:40.528 --> 38:42.994
- He snatched a purse!
- And he'll think harder...

38:43.061 --> 38:45.128
before he ever
does it again, won't he?

38:45.194 --> 38:47.228
He pled guilty
under the condition of no jail.

38:47.294 --> 38:50.061
- How can you--
- That was state court.

38:50.128 --> 38:53.828
How can any plea agreement
be reliable if the federal
government can just swoop in--

38:53.894 --> 38:58.361
Your motion is denied.
The charge stands.

38:58.428 --> 39:00.294
Ten minute recess.

39:02.461 --> 39:04.761
<i>We go to trial.</i>
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

39:04.828 --> 39:07.861
We go to trial and prove
that you didn't try
to target tourists.

39:07.928 --> 39:11.028
You didn't, right?
Of course I didn't.
I just wanted the money.

39:12.728 --> 39:14.594
It's their own fault,
Ellenor.

39:14.661 --> 39:17.461
If they weren't
so busy snappin' pictures
and buyin' postcards,

39:17.528 --> 39:19.528
they never would have
lost their bags.
Hmm.

39:19.594 --> 39:21.528
People need
to pay attention.
Okay, you know what?

39:21.594 --> 39:24.628
We're not gonna lead
with that either, Warren.
Hey.

39:24.694 --> 39:26.628
Lindsay,
it's all upside down.

39:26.694 --> 39:28.861
Peabody's goin' to jail
for flushin' too much water.

39:28.928 --> 39:31.794
Warren could get 20 years
for stealin' a handbag.

39:31.861 --> 39:34.661
And the murderer in Rebecca's
trial is probably gonna walk.

39:34.728 --> 39:36.628
It's just--
It's all upside down.

39:36.694 --> 39:38.594
It's less upside down.

39:38.661 --> 39:41.728
I got Peabody's
sentence suspended,
conditioned on new toilets...

39:41.794 --> 39:43.694
subject to random
inspection.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.894
You owe me.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.528
The government
inspects toilets?

gave me the wrong shirt.

39:59.994 --> 40:03.461
- No.
- Uh, correct shirt.

Thank you.
Okay, look, uh, I want
to apologize for my, uh, uh--

40:09.461 --> 40:12.928

I just lost my composure
a little.

You apologize
for shirt too now?

40:25.928 --> 40:27.928
Excuse me?

40:27.994 --> 40:29.928
No shrink.
Apologize.

40:29.994 --> 40:32.794
Uh, you gave me
the wrong shirt.

40:32.861 --> 40:35.561
But we didn't shrink.
Apologize.

40:35.628 --> 40:39.328
Why should I apologize?
You did make a mistake.

40:39.394 --> 40:43.394
Innocent mistake,
but you say we shrink.
That's slander.

40:43.461 --> 40:46.694
You called me fat!
That's slander.
Truth defense.

40:46.761 --> 40:49.161

You owe apology.

40:49.228 --> 40:51.861
I'm not gonna apologize
for anything.
We no shrink!

Ah, stubborn!

on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

I have to admit,
seeing it from this side,

what you do for a living--

42:48.094 --> 42:51.761
Yeah.

Oh.
Judge Winchell's ruling had
the wrong file number listed,
