Oh my God,
I missed my flight again.

My mom's gonna be so mad at me.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.934
So uh, are you gonna try
to catch the next flight out?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.536
Are you kicking me out, Omar?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.504
No, no, I'm just,
I'm just saying.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.607
Okay good, because
I have a killer headache.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.110

Hey, just hoping you got
some good news for me.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.600
Well if you're talking
about the Flex-Space, I haven't
heard back from Rachel yet.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.136
But look,a short-term lease
for your budget...

02:17.070 --> 02:18.539
might be a little difficult.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.574
Maybe we go a little further
outside the city?

02:20.608 --> 02:23.877
Um, yeah, I mean that just
sounds like the perfect way
to make sure

02:23.911 --> 02:25.779
that nobody shows up, you know?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.615
I'm trying, man.

I'm not worried
about Greg being there.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.531
And Greg'll need security, I
don't.

around the house.

I should do it formally
and write you a letter.

could I invest in if I get

with the rate,
all you had to do was--

06:07.668 --> 06:09.537
No, no, no, no,
the rate is fine.

I don't, I don't backtrack.

more along the lines of uh,

06:32.192 --> 06:33.827

why does it have to be Black?

Shouldn't it be something that
benefits everyone, you know?

to business loans,

in there somewhere.

a college fund for white people
it would be a problem.

about everything.

come over here to bore you
with my personal problems.

Nah, you are my nephew.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.638

Black men to open up.

who really understands,

09:33.306 --> 09:36.209

understand women like I do.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.383
How did you and Aunt Val make
it through these years, man?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.386
It's simple.
I married my best friend.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.388
Now, you kids these days,

09:48.421 --> 09:52.525
y'all get with somebody
'cause they fine or 'cause
they got a lot of followers.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.728
Fine ain't gonna
raise your kids right.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.731
I feel like
I married my best friend, man.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.002
Now I barely even know her.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.237
She's hardly home.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.706
Work's a top priority.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.643
Seem like a ball,
so what's the problem?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.746
I don't know,
I guess I'm just used to my mom
cooking and cleaning.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.718
It just seems like black women
aren't as traditional
as they used to be, man.

10:18.118 --> 10:22.422
And it feels like Naomi
wants a man she can run over,
and that is not me.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.623
Nephew everybody grows.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.626
Most people grow apart.

10:27.427 --> 10:32.733
Lord knows it is damn hard
to find a way to grow together,
but you got to concentrate

10:32.766 --> 10:35.368
on the simple things you did
when you first met.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.639
I don't want to lose her.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.744
So you don't mind
losing one of your friends?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.014
What are you talking about?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.282
Well maybe if I said it
in Spanglish.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.819
Would that help you understand?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.856
See, I should've knew
you slid up
into Dive last night.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.792
And me and Booker watched you
slither your way out,
but don't worry.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.095
What happens in the Dive,
stays in the Dive.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.467
Thanks Unc.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.136
Ha, no sweat nephew.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.872
But you gonna cut the grass
before you go home.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.540
Cut the grass?

11:13.573 --> 11:16.376
If you got me cutting
all this grass, it's gonna cost
you way more than that $300

11:16.409 --> 11:17.344
I paid you back.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.880
But it's 250 for that plate.
