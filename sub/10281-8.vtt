WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:07.141
Previously on ER:

00:07.175 --> 00:09.110
What are you doing?!
Cut the hell out!

00:09.143 --> 00:10.611
What are you doing?
He just grabbed my ass.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.413
What are the odds we're going
to find someone better?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.581
We're at that point
where we should be spending

00:13.614 --> 00:14.482
either all our time together

00:14.515 --> 00:16.117
or none at all,

00:16.149 --> 00:17.718
and I'm kind of leaning
towards none at all.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.453
Sign it.
So, what, this goes up
to Human Resources now?

00:19.487 --> 00:20.688
It stays with me until
I have a fat enough file

00:20.721 --> 00:22.756
to pull the
trigger. Bang.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.363
Sinus tach, 130.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.798
BP's up. 220/140.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.165
Come on. He's going
to blow an O-ring.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.068
Let's try Nipride.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.736
Oh, what? How did the
paramedics miss this?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.305
Cocaine?

00:37.338 --> 00:38.672
Could be.
Okay, hold the Nipride.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.807
He needs a beta-blocker.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.709
Five of metoprolol, IV push.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.444
Heart rate's up to 140.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.412
Metoprolol's in.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.446
He's seizing.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.081
Okay, two of Ativan.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.382
ROMANO:
Hey, Abby, what are

00:48.416 --> 00:49.483
the physiological effects
of cocaine?

00:49.517 --> 00:50.584
It's a sympathetic stimulant.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.585
Alpha or beta?

00:51.619 --> 00:52.653
NEELA:
Both.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.687
SAM:
V-tach.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.688
Starting compressions.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.424
Uh, charge to 200.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.226
Check for pulse
with compressions.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.295
Clear.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.664
V-fib.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.299
Charge to 300.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.434
Amp of epi.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.701
The beta-blocker made him worse.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.503
Clear.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.206
No change.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.707
360. Maybe he's allergic.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.476
I doubt it.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.877
By blocking beta,
you've left alpha unopposed.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.212
His BP's going
through the roof

01:18.246 --> 01:18.846
and he's bleeding in his brain.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.315
Clear!

01:21.349 --> 01:23.284
Asystole.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.418
Amp of atropine.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.486
Okay, what should she give?

01:25.519 --> 01:26.620
Phentolamine
and esmolol.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.621
Gold dot for your forehead.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.789
I've seen beta-blockers

01:28.822 --> 01:30.558
work before.
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.393
I forgot you have nursing
experience, which means

01:32.426 --> 01:33.861
that you can handle 90% of
patients. Unfortunately,

01:33.894 --> 01:35.463
it also means you might kill

01:35.496 --> 01:36.897
the other ten percent.
He's not dead yet.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.166
Another amp of epi.
Forget it. That's it.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.700
Stop compressions.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.909 --> 01:50.844
Just another dead junkie.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.748
Congratulations, Abby.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.586
You managed to kill
the practice dummy.

01:58.619 --> 02:02.190
Okay, reset for
the next student.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.641
Shame we have to work
the holiday.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.708
You got family in town?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.410
No.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.945
Your overdose
was much harder

02:57.978 --> 03:00.281
than my dialysis patient
with hyperkalemia.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.949
I need a room to hold
an ICU admit.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.584
CHUNY:
Sorry, bad
MVA coming in.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.952
So where do I put him?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.920
Anywhere, as long
as it's in the hallway.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.489
Come on.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.657
Can't you just get me
some pills?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.325
That wouldn't be safe.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.893
Mr. Garland has
pneumonia with hypoxia.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.662
You need IV antibiotics.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.597
I need to be with my family
for Thanksgiving.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.766
They can come
and visit you here.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.268
How was the mock code?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.435
Fine.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.903
So Romano humiliated you?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.004
I looked like an idiot.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.606
He does that to everyone.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.275
Or maybe I just
don't get it.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.442
You'll catch on.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.344
It just takes
a little time.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.613
Stay up there, turkey.
Come on.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.881
Son of a bitch.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.383
Better call the coroner
on that one.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.550
The damn night shift
was supposed

03:36.584 --> 03:37.785
to take care
of all of this.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.287
I'm just in charge
of the potluck.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.622
Well, my yams
are in the lounge.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.291
How many admits
are we holding?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.692
You don't want to know.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.427
No, there's a sandwich
in the fridge.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.961
And don't answer the door
until I get home.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.763
All right. See you soon.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
Everything okay?

03:51.599 --> 03:52.966
Yeah, I had to leave Alex
at home for the day.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.302
Oh, he'll be all right.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.603
It's just until 3:00.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.004
I'm finally going to
get to make my kid

03:57.037 --> 03:58.539
a real Thanksgiving dinner.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.973
Most years I've
had to work.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.375
That's Lily's.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.677
I thought it was
for the potluck.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.012
There's a coffee club.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.480
Yeah, you have to pay
every month.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.416
Sorry. How much?

04:08.449 --> 04:11.485
It's a nurse's coffee club.

04:11.519 --> 04:14.555
Okay, time to stamp out disease.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.556
Hand lac for Coop.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.724
Hit me again.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.858
Oh, one per customer.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.892
Asthma for Neela.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.695
Vag bleeding for Abby.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.531
Lovely.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.032
And "bugs are crawling
under my skin" for Lester.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.667
Cool.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.001
Hey, Pratt, will you take
the incoming trauma?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.637
Yeah. Hey, Frank.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.871
What's up with the
stupid parade, man?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.773
Put the game on.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.675
Hey, kickoff isn't till 12:30.
My brother-in-law is marching

04:34.708 --> 04:36.344
with the Brundy County
Sheriff's Posse.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.011
Oh, yeah, what's that?
Some sort of clan?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.547
Hey, Morris.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.948
What do you think
you're doing?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.450
Picking up a patient.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.584
You just skipped over
"bloody diarrhea"

04:43.617 --> 04:44.752
for... "eye pain."

04:44.785 --> 04:46.520
FRANK:
Smile!
Frank?

04:46.554 --> 04:48.722
Sorry, I didn't think
this old thing would still work.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.890
1t was in
last year's box.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.091
Couple of shots left.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.960
What do you figure
is on there?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.062
Might be Romano and Weaver
in a compromising position.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.031
I'll get double prints then,
just in case.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.068
ABBY:
October 14.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.504
Six weeks and three days.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.506
So I'm still pregnant?

05:05.539 --> 05:07.475
We'll check an ultrasound.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.477
How heavy is the spotting?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.613
Uh... couple
of pads so far.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.948
Are you taking
any medications?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.518
Prenatal vitamins, AZT,

05:17.551 --> 05:19.052
3TC, and indinavir.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.021
You're HIV-positive?

05:21.054 --> 05:22.890
Yeah, for ten years.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.659
Never shared a needle,
no blood transfusions.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.127
Just a loser boyfriend

05:27.160 --> 05:28.696
with too many chicks
on the side.

05:28.729 --> 05:29.697
Anyone here with you today?

05:29.730 --> 05:30.831
Yeah, My fiancÃ©.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.600
He's driving up from Iowa City.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.468
This guy's the real deal.
( knocking )

05:34.502 --> 05:35.469
Abby?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.638
Excuse me.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.072
Three sick calls
for night shift.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.074
( chuckles ):
Right, sick.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.109
On Thanksgiving.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.744
Call the registry.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.014
We really need someone
who knows the floor.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.483
No.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.618
No way.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.620
I'm on all day as a med student.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.922
I only work nursing shifts
on weekends.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.123
I can let you off
your rotation

05:56.156 --> 05:57.758
at 5:00
so you can take a nap.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.527
Can you take one
for the team?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.928
No.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.499
Okay, fine. Only if you
can't find anybody else.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.435
Thanks.
Okay.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.639
MORRIS:
So you're not
using the eyedrops?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.474
My nephew gave me
an herbal medicine.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.976
What, some sort
of homeopathic crap?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.778
Morris, come on, man.
Trauma's here.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.981
I think it's called Kona Gold.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.818
Morris, grab some four-by-fours.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.920
Uh, yeah.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.689
Okay, this is pretty deep.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.157
I wanted to use
the carving knife.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.859
She made me use
the other thing.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.993
( knife buzzing )

06:33.026 --> 06:34.862
It's from Germany.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.597
PRATT:
Morris!

06:36.630 --> 06:37.998
Morgan Westbrook, traffic
collision with intrusion.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.099
BP: 80 palp

06:39.132 --> 06:40.668
with obvious
pelvic fracture.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.169
O2 SATs: 98. No
significant head trauma.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.204
Didn't get altered
until he dropped his pressure.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.173
On the phone to his doctor
when we pulled up.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.708
Drives a Bentley.
Oh, nice.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.143
Okay, prime
the rapid infuser.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.144
Come on. Let's go.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.546
Here we go. On my count.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.747
Uno, dos, tres.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.182
( grunting )

06:55.215 --> 06:56.750
How do we tell pelvic bleeding

06:56.784 --> 06:58.185
from intra-abdominal?
MORRIS:
CT scan.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.720
What if the
patient's unstable?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.054
Uh, ultrasound?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.890
No, suprapubic
mini-lap and DPL.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.024
Which you can assist on.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.726
Pupils equal and reactive.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.094
Looks like we got some
sewing for you, too.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.896
Can you two handle this?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.564
Oh, I should hope so.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.199
Good. I need to get back
to my glaucoma patient.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.734
Morris, this is
a primo teaching case.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.035
I'm worried about angle closure.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.169
No hemotympanum.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.605
I need to check eye pressures.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.007
( sighs )

07:20.040 --> 07:21.208
Equal breath sounds.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.743
Is he squeamish?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.112
No, just stupid.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.747
Frank, where are the nurses?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.915
With patients.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.517
I need a chaperone.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.584
Sam, can you help me
with a pelvic?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.919
After I hang
blood in trauma.

07:31.952 --> 07:32.820
Can we bring a few
patients back?

07:32.853 --> 07:33.987
Eventually.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.689
I've done solo pelvics.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.758
I could help,
if you'd like.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.192
That's okay. Thanks.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.228
No, no, we are boarding
five ICU players

07:41.261 --> 07:43.063
and it's total gridlock.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.266
I'll give you an hour.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.203
Mr. Garland, looks like you
might be with us for a while.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.673
Not a problem.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.076
What's that?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.911
"Turducken."

07:57.945 --> 07:59.780
What?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.214
It's chicken stuffed in a
duck, stuffed in turkey.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.550
You want a taste?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.552
Maybe later.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.655
( moans )

08:07.688 --> 08:09.222
Sorry.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.224
( sighs )

08:11.258 --> 08:12.960
No, no, it wasn't you.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.662
Just a cramp.

08:14.695 --> 08:20.133
There's a little bit
more bleeding than I expected.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.869
And the cervix is open.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
Meaning?

08:23.771 --> 08:26.173
With the cervix open,
you can't maintain a pregnancy.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.675
I'm sorry.

08:29.677 --> 08:34.114
I had a feeling.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.616
( groggily ):
I woke up and something...

08:35.649 --> 08:38.686
something was strange.

08:38.719 --> 08:43.190
We've been trying
to get preg... pregnant...

08:43.222 --> 08:45.793
For how long?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.962
Loren?

08:50.698 --> 08:53.133
Loren?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.870
Damn it.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.709
( beeping )

09:03.310 --> 09:04.678
FRANK ( on speaker ):
Can I help you?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.079
This is Abby.
Who's at Admit?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.247
Just me and the food.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.849
Well, my patient's bleeding out.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.284
I'll see who I can rustle up.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.793
Could use a little help here!

09:19.827 --> 09:21.929
Systolic's 110
after two units.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.097
Spontaneous
eye movements.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.933
( man groaning )

09:25.966 --> 09:27.067
Mr. Westbrook?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.235
Where am I?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.637
You're at County General.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.104
You got clipped
by a tow truck.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.107
( groans )
Try not to move your leg.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.243
What do you think you're doing?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.211
I'm calling my lawyer.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.047
I'd rather not be treated here.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.248
You may have internal bleeding.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.183
I'll take my chances.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.118
Your cell phone interferes
with our equipment.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.153
Hello.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.287
It's Morgan Westbrook...

09:47.320 --> 09:48.689
Hey, I said no cell phones!

09:49.690 --> 09:51.324
Hello, Mr. Westbrook.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.660
I'm Robert Romano,

09:52.693 --> 09:54.261
Chief of Emergency Services.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.964
I just got off the phone
with our CEO, Peter Fenwick.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.399
Oh, Peter was in my class
at Wharton.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.934
Yeah, so I heard.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.302
I think your employees

10:02.335 --> 10:04.304
need a lesson
in customer service.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.939
This one stole my phone.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.342
Well, he's not long
for this hospital.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.112
We're taking him up to CT.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.181
Great. After a few tests,
we'll work on a transfer.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.415
Thank you.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.084
You're welcome.
And don't worry.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.318
You are in excellent
hands with Dr. Corday.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.887
Believe me, I envy you.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.954
Hey.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.756
Come here.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.658
That guy is the biggest real
estate developer in Chicago.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.193
Yeah, more like
the biggest prick.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.761
Now, when you get a
VIP patient, sometimes...

10:27.795 --> 10:29.262
You treat them the same
as everybody else.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.264
He's not stable.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.933
Well, if he has no solid organ
injuries, I say he is stable.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.167
Well, then you're making
a big mistake.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.903
He could have
ongoing hemorrhage.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.237
My only mistake was
continuing to allow you

10:37.270 --> 10:38.772
to practice medicine, Pratt.
Wait a minute.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.007
You're willing
to compromise patient care

10:40.040 --> 10:41.374
just so you can suck
up to some rich guy?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.743
No, we will
determine objectively

10:42.776 --> 10:44.011
if he's able to be
transferred...

10:44.044 --> 10:47.080
I'm not signing
any transfer papers.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.348
Well, you don't have to

10:48.381 --> 10:50.818
because you're no longer
on the case.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.319
Well, great. Then my name
won't be mentioned in
your malpractice suit

10:52.352 --> 10:53.754
when he bleeds to death.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.755
Yeah, and as far
as I'm concerned,

10:54.788 --> 10:55.355
you no longer work here.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.456
Right.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.191
No, I'm serious, Pratt.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.194
You just pissed me off
for the last time.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.303
Second liter's in.
Pressure's 100/60.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.939
LOREN:
Whoa.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.941
Hey, Loren.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.276
Gave us a little scare.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.245
You passed out
from blood loss.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.080
That doesn't sound good.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.315
Well, there can be
retained tissue
that keeps bleeding.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.951
Hemoglobin's 9.4.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.919
Okay, type and
cross for two.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.088
How do you stop that?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.823
With a D and C.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.958
We clean things out,
and then you're back to normal.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.428
Abby...

11:41.001 --> 11:42.269
Let's get you
a fresh gown.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.304
I'll be right back.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.206
There is no retained tissue.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.808
She has multiple
uterine fibroids.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.476
It's not going to be
as simple as a D and C.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.444
You should be careful
what you say.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.284
Most of the time,
it's retained...

11:57.317 --> 11:58.518
Not in her case.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.921
Transfuse two units
and call GYN.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.156
We have to get
this bleeding to stop.

12:07.494 --> 12:11.231
Next time, wear oven
mitts before you take
out the turkey, okay?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
Oh, there.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.935
Hey, Frank, what's the score?

12:14.968 --> 12:17.237
First quarter,
zero-zero.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.339
Oh, you're back
from the scan?

12:19.372 --> 12:22.442
Bilateral pubic rami
fractures and a
shattered acetabulum.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.377
Ouch.
And we've got Todd
Corbett on stand-by

12:24.411 --> 12:25.879
at the Mayo Clinic.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.414
Hey, you think
I'll be able to run

12:27.447 --> 12:28.849
the Marathon
next October?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.317
I'd say there's
a good chance.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.386
That guy could put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.422
I'll be right there.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.490
All right, what part
of "You're off the case"
do you not understand?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.827
I'm just looking out
for the best interests
of the patient.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.494
Did you send off
another CBC?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.931
Keep it up, Pratt.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.899
What, another letter
in my file?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.467
No, you and I are
meeting with Weaver
and Anspaugh

12:47.500 --> 12:49.136
at the end of
your shift.
On Thanksgiving?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.939
That's right.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.507
Well, I guess it saves you
from spending it alone.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.145
Did you call Psych
about your bug guy?

12:58.178 --> 12:59.980
No, he really
has scabies.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.448
My asthma girl's worse.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.316
Call RT for heliox.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.452
Lewis, get coverage
for Pratt's shifts
starting tomorrow.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.320
Complex laceration?

13:07.354 --> 13:09.456
I repaired the
extensor tendon with
a figure of eight.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.457
Looks nice.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.459
Yes... very tidy.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.428
Abby, where's the abductor
pollicis brevis insert?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.529
You know its innervation?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.265
Smile!

13:19.266 --> 13:22.069
My patient needs blood.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.871
Okay, just put your
dirty clothes in the hamper.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.205
Did you check your sugar
at noon?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.340
Timoptic, one drop
two times a day.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.575
What about the other stuff?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.311
You don't need it.
It's illegal...

13:31.344 --> 13:32.345
Just say "no."

13:32.379 --> 13:33.446
Just say no to what?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.882
Altar boys.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.316
Look at this rack.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.051
Do I have to?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.887
We need to treat patients
in Triage again.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.921
Meet 'em and street 'em.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.222
Whoa, not so
fast, Luka.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.924
Couple of problems
in the hall.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.027
Jeffries spiked to 104.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.462
Tylenol, blood cultures
and a gram of Cefotetan.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.630
When can he go up?

13:50.663 --> 13:51.932
Fifth in line
for med-surg...

13:51.965 --> 13:53.500
Mrs. Paulson's
now altered.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.035
Two tele admits
in front of her.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.503
How are you doing, ma'am?

13:56.536 --> 13:59.206
30cc's of lactulose,
and, uh, draw

13:59.239 --> 14:03.010
an ammonia level.
And Mr. Garland's BP
is down to 90 systolic.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.477
Start Dopamine
at five mikes...

14:04.511 --> 14:06.346
Sorry for the delay, sir.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.282
That's okay.
I like to people-watch.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.918
Can you help us
at Triage?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.485
No.
Why not?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.221
'Cause you just gave me
about an hour's worth of orders.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.455
This is ridiculous.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.090
We have no
beds, no staff,

14:17.124 --> 14:18.525
and we're doing the work
of the entire hospital.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.228
Yep, welcome to my world.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.530
I need hard restraints
for Mr. Garland.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.365
Garland? He's a pussycat.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.134
The kind that lock.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.939
Have you ever had
any problems with
general anesthesia?

14:31.939 --> 14:33.506
Hepatitis?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.076
No, they check my liver enzymes
on the triple cocktail.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.111
I need you to sign
a consent form

14:38.145 --> 14:41.548
for exploratory surgery
and a possible hysterectomy.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.316
Hysterectomy?

14:43.350 --> 14:44.684
Only as a last resort.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.687
Nobody said anything
about a hysterectomy.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.590
Well, it may be
our only option

14:50.623 --> 14:52.325
if we can't control
the bleeding.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.063
No. I want to have kids.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.264
I appreciate that.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.598
Dr. Coburn, do you
have a minute?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.035
Hang two more units

15:02.069 --> 15:03.636
and check another
hemoglobin.

15:06.139 --> 15:10.577
Um... why do a hysterectomy
for fibroids?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.079
Because it might
save her life.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.981
Well, there are other options.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.515
I usually don't justify my
operative approach to a nurse.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.184
I'm a fourth-year med student.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.019
Well, we consent
for all contingencies.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.653
Are you even going
to attempt embolization?

15:20.687 --> 15:23.256
That would take hours.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.259
Okay, I'm not sure
I'm getting your point.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.161
She's bleeding out.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.663
She's on her fourth unit,
and she's not stable

15:30.697 --> 15:32.532
for embolization.
Uh-huh, and maybe
she would be

15:32.565 --> 15:33.633
if she wasn't HIV-positive?

15:33.666 --> 15:34.567
What are you accusing me of?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.036
Ladies, please,

15:36.069 --> 15:37.037
let me settle
this catfight.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.438
Abby, you're wrong.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.739
We were discussing
uterus-sparing procedures.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.274
On an HIV-positive
woman? Why?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.575
Yeah, thank you, Robert.
I can handle this.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.377
She wants to have a baby.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.546
Well, maybe this is God's way
of saying, "Bad idea."

15:46.579 --> 15:49.549
With a low viral load,
transmission rate is less
than three percent.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.584
Uh-huh, and the kid'll
be motherless by age ten.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.023
I'll attempt
a myomectomy,

15:56.023 --> 15:58.025
but I can't make
any promises.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.237
Probable rotator
cuff tear.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.671
I thought it was a game
of touch football.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.174
My sister-in-law
doesn't like to lose.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.044
Happy Thanksgiving,
Dr. Lewis.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.611
Excuse me.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.280
Uh, thank you.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.649
Don't thank me.
Thank some dead guy from Mercy.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.384
Very romantic.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.587
So, you in the mood
for some late-night pumpkin pie?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.290
Um... you know what?
I'm beat.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
I'll bring the whipped cream.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.196
Maybe another time.
You okay?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.697
Yeah, I'm just tired.

16:37.730 --> 16:38.731
Of me?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.500
FRANK:
GSW to the face

16:40.533 --> 16:42.069
en route.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.203
Morris, you're with me.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.739
Talk to you later.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.544
Two liters NC,
TKO the saline.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.246
Five-minute ETA on
the private chopper.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.215
I'm Chuck.
I'm Dr. Hewitt
from Northwestern.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.549
I'll be flying with you.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.385
Hands inside the car, man.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.520
I appreciate everything
you've done, Dr. Romano.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.089
My pleasure.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.556
Are you coming up to
the copter with us?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.157
Oh, well, I'd like to,
but, as you can see,

17:05.192 --> 17:06.358
we are completely
swamped, so, uh...

17:06.393 --> 17:07.727
I don't know
how you do it, Robert.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.561
Aw, I guess
it's just my calling.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.199
Thanks a lot. Take care.
Have a good flight.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.402
WESTBROOK:
Thank you.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.836
Hold that elevator.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.406
So you still think
there's still a chance?

17:19.439 --> 17:21.108
Yeah, I do. A good one.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.575
Abby, Mrs. Marshall
is praying

17:22.608 --> 17:23.710
to the porcelain
God again.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.712
Uh, okay.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.414
Reglan and Tagamet.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.216
My fiancee's
coming to the ER.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.351
Okay, um, I'll bring him up,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.786
and I'm going to scrub in,
make sure you're okay.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.561
This is for painkillers.

17:41.594 --> 17:44.731
Keep them. After ten years
of marriage, I'm immune to pain.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.399
Helium gets deeper
into the lungs.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.567
I won't float away,
will I?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.769
No, but you may
talk funny.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.738
Frank, Pedes ICU have a bed yet?

17:51.771 --> 17:52.839
In your dreams.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.441
Hey, chow-line's open.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.708
Yeah, I think you
forgot something.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.410
What?
Emesis basins.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.878
Shouldn't you be
on the roof?
No.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.581
Mr. Moneybags left his Rolex
in the Trauma Room.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.882
So have one of the
nurses take it up.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.251
They're busy.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.818
Hey, Indira,

18:05.852 --> 18:07.554
take that up
to the helipad.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.189
How do I get there?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.790
Look, I don't blame you
for being scared.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.161
Last thing you need is to lose
another limb up there.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.896
Come on.
I'll take you up.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.431
Someone stole
my medicine.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.699
Talk to the hand.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.234
What kind of medicine?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.569
For my glaucoma.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.770
Who was your doctor?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.905
Young guy, red hair,
and goatee.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.775
GSW to the mid-face.
Where the hell is Morris?

18:34.347 --> 18:37.617
( horn honks, siren blares )

18:41.354 --> 18:43.223
KOVAC:
So, uh, about tonight--

18:43.256 --> 18:45.858
It's okay that I'm coming
for dinner?
What?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.560
Alex invited me.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.732
What is this?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.467
Septic pneumonia patient.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.802
We don't have
any beds.
Neither do we.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.804
You said they accepted him.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.239
You can't just come
up here without
calling report.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.673
Here is your report.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.575
72-year-old
pneumonia patient

19:02.609 --> 19:03.676
on Cefotaxime, five mikes

19:03.710 --> 19:05.478
of dopamine, and six

19:05.512 --> 19:07.814
liters of O2.
He might leave AMA.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.848
What are you doing?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.450
Take it easy.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.751
He's a troublemaker.

19:12.785 --> 19:13.786
This is really stupid.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.954
You have more nurses.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.856
We can't take
extra patients.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.692
Why not?
We do it all the time.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.328
Now you can't

19:21.361 --> 19:22.929
send him back.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.553
Are you coming?

19:50.257 --> 19:51.558
Dr. Romano?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.860
Are you coming?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.328
Here, take it.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.897
Patient forgot

19:57.930 --> 19:59.399
his watch.
Thank you.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.533
Keep your head down.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.868
I know the drill.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.936
This isn't your flight.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.905
FRAN:
Dispatch sent me.

20:05.938 --> 20:06.873
There's only room
for two attendants.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.242
Right, me and the doc.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.644
No, I have to go.
Insurance requirement.
She's off the flight.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.954
Hey!

20:54.987 --> 20:56.623
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.924
Uh, nothing.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.392
Give me that.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.560
Uh, it's not
what you think.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.928
Yeah. Get your ass
back inside,

21:01.961 --> 21:03.430
sit down at Admit,

21:03.463 --> 21:05.031
and do not move
until I come get you.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.455
( grunts )

21:28.488 --> 21:29.489
The strap

21:29.522 --> 21:31.023
is caught.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.990
Fine. Just call the
nursing supervisor.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.091
You're not helping

22:05.124 --> 22:06.626
to solve the problem.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.060
( screams )

22:12.832 --> 22:14.801
( screams ):
No!

22:27.580 --> 22:29.015
( grunting )

22:29.048 --> 22:30.750
Open up four ORs
and get every surgeon down here.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.084
Done.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.420
COOP:
Three criticals out here.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.621
Yeah, copy that. Mike?
Yo.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.623
O2 and IVs outside.
Let's go.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.458
Lester, we need backboards, man.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.892
( knocking on glass )
Dr. Pratt?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.160
From the roof.
( sighs )

22:41.193 --> 22:42.495
Morris, get busy.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.663
I can't.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.997
NEELA:
Decreased breath sounds.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.065
Weak carotid pulse.
What's open?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.900
Trauma Two.
Chest tube.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.503
ET and two
large-bore IVs.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.571
Send X-ray

22:51.604 --> 22:53.440
down here for a portable.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.575
Should I set up a thoraseal?
No, no. I need
you to triage.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.009
Go. We got this. Go!

22:57.043 --> 22:58.911
Neela, grab a box.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.447
What is it?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.915
Mass-casualty bins
and lots of morphine.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.584
How much longer?

23:04.617 --> 23:05.752
Soon as I get this crike.
What happened?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.454
Helicopter crash.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.721
Up on the roof?
In the bay.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.156
Any survivors?

23:10.189 --> 23:11.057
I don't know.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.692
Find out! Go!

23:15.127 --> 23:16.763
FRANK:
I closed us
to internal disaster.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.030
NEELA:
What should I be doing?

23:18.064 --> 23:20.800
Grab this gurney.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.102
Okay. Put one of these
on every patient.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.571
Fill in vitals,

23:24.604 --> 23:26.873
injury, and tear off
the triage category.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.140
Morris!

23:28.174 --> 23:29.542
Romano told me
to wait here.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.710
Green for minor,
yellow, delayed,

23:30.743 --> 23:32.579
red, immediate,
black, dead.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.780
Green and yellow stay in Chairs.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.847
Bring back
red right away.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.048
What about black?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.083
Cover them
with a sheet.

23:37.116 --> 23:37.917
Where should I start?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.018
Anywhere.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.653
We need two more gurneys.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.655
How bad is it?

23:42.689 --> 23:44.791
( sirens wailing )

23:59.271 --> 24:00.873
You okay?

24:00.907 --> 24:01.874
Just a little dizzy.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.042
Backboard!

24:03.075 --> 24:04.644
( man coughing )

24:04.677 --> 24:05.878
( woman groaning )

24:09.682 --> 24:10.783
Did they pull anyone out?

24:10.817 --> 24:12.218
Not yet. Meet Reina Flores.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.886
Came in for
heart failure,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.588
and now she
needs ortho.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.756
It hurts quite a bit.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.859
( people groaning )

24:22.729 --> 24:24.531
LEWIS:
Abby, morphine.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.698
All right.
What about him?

24:25.732 --> 24:26.999
I'm fine. Take care of her.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.134
Chest pains, broken ribs.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.168
COOP:
Abdominal pain

24:29.201 --> 24:30.603
and weak pulse.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.071
Abby, I need four of morphine.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.710
Susan, you should go inside.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.045
We got this covered.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.913
Oh, her lungs are wet.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.783
She needs a
nitro spray,

24:43.816 --> 24:47.253
40 of Lasix, and dopamine
to keep her systolic above 90.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.055
Are you all right, dear?

24:50.056 --> 24:52.859
Yeah, it's just the smoke.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.128
( fire alarm blaring )

24:56.162 --> 24:57.864
Hey, get me out of here!

24:57.897 --> 25:00.700
Get me out of this!

25:00.733 --> 25:02.101
You're okay,
Mr. Garland.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.270
We have to move patients
to the ER.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.638
No, they'll be swamped.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.006
We can treat them here.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.207
I'll call down for help.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.909
No. The phones
are dead.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.243
Get him to the other side.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.813
I can't find the key.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.948
You're going to
be okay, ma'am.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.117
Not if I don't make it
to my granddaughter's wedding.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.118
When's that?

25:19.151 --> 25:20.252
Two weeks.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.021
Hypotensive with a rigid belly.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.623
Call Corday.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.657
Blunt chest, good vitals.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.258
Okay.
How is my wife?

25:26.292 --> 25:27.594
Who's in charge?

25:27.627 --> 25:28.728
Uh, Dr. Lewis.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.230
Right here.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.699
Fire's just
about out.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.833
I got nothing
for you.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.868
But I got four
for the coroner.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.170
You know, Luka's on.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.639
I can get him
to cover for you.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.973
No.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.109
Abby, respiratory arrest
in Curtain One.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.177
( woman whimpering )

25:48.815 --> 25:50.149
Hey, nurse, I'm chained
to the wall here.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.183
SAM:
Double up
the patients,

25:51.217 --> 25:52.785
two per slot.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.086
Sam, I need some help over here.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.187
Get an E cylinder
for every vent

25:55.221 --> 25:56.756
before you move them.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.758
The fire melted her ET tube.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.026
I have to reintubate.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.293
Burned her
central line, too.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.763
Oh, Doc, get me loose.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.064
Get me loose.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.298
Here you go, 8-0.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.000
I'm not ready
for the tube yet.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.836
You said you
wanted to intubate.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.771
I think she aspirated
the short end into her lungs.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.072
I need something
to fish it out.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.641
You want a MacGill?

26:14.641 --> 26:15.842
Keep pressure on the
subclavian. I'll see

26:15.875 --> 26:16.876
what I can find.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.711
Help! Somebody, help!

26:20.680 --> 26:22.749
Ready with a backboard
and splint.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.919
How are you doing, Reina?

26:26.953 --> 26:30.122
Better than the poor souls
in that helicopter.

26:33.826 --> 26:34.961
PICKMAN:
Pulse ox
down to 88.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.162
LEWIS:
Put her up to ten liters.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.163
Susan?

26:37.196 --> 26:38.297
Kerry.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.666
Susan, are
you okay?

26:39.699 --> 26:40.667
Were you hurt?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.101
No, no. I'm fine.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.803
Okay, who are the
other attendings?

26:43.836 --> 26:45.204
Um, uh...

26:45.237 --> 26:46.906
Luka and Romano.
I don't know where they are.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.274
You shouldn't get tied
up with one patient

26:48.307 --> 26:50.076
when you're the
incident commander.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.377
You've got to keep your
eye on the big picture.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.745
Chuck's on the chopper.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.813
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.014
She's more hypoxic.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.348
How's your breathing, Reina?

26:56.382 --> 26:57.717
We're having

26:57.750 --> 26:58.718
212 wedding guests.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.119
Can you imagine? Oh.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.120
LEWIS:
She's altered.
She needs an airway.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.755
WEAVER:
Curtain Two.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.356
COOP:
Both traumas are going up
to the OR.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.858
Stay with Dr. Lewis.
This one has
a flail chest.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.694
Okay, Trauma
Two with me.
Got it.

27:07.694 --> 27:12.164
Abby, you and Pratt take
the yellows to Exam Three.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.734
Pulse ox dropped
to 88 on five liters.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.035
Is there blood in the belly?

27:16.068 --> 27:17.704
That's my wife.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.071
We're taking her up to the OR
for an ex-lap.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.272
Berta.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.874
WEAVER:
She's in good hands.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.309
Oh, Happy Thanksgiving,
Dr. Weaver.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.045
Yeah, you, too.
Didn't get past the relish tray.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.714
This was a tough one.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.115
Had to tube this lady
on her side.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.083
LOCKHART:
Hey, Pratt,
you're with us.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.251
Do you know
how to debride?

27:32.284 --> 27:33.385
I've done it once.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.386
All right,
let's go.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.922
Hey, what happened, man?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.256
I don't know.
Bad concussion.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.257
Neuro check's, 215.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.892
I fell to my hand.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.360
You lifted patients
like that?
Yes, doctor.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.095
Damn, you are one
tough muchaca.
Yes, doctor.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.931
CHUCK:
I need a doctor here.
All right.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.766
Through-and-through
penetrating neck.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.735
I tubed him
for an expanding hematoma.

27:48.735 --> 27:49.902
On the roof?

27:49.936 --> 27:51.070
Weren't you the flight nurse?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.271
Supposed to be.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.073
Lily, Trauma One.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.374
500cc's in.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.076
Mm-hmm. You
started a line?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.878
Yeah, 14-gauge
in case he needed blood.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.146
Is that Mel?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.914
Yeah, trauma panel,
type and cross

28:01.948 --> 28:03.950
for six, lateral c-spine
and let's get surgery down here.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.385
Nice and easy.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.755
CO2 detector
is yellow.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.259
We need to tube you, too?

28:13.292 --> 28:15.762
I thought he was dead.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.034
How long
until we check

28:22.068 --> 28:23.870
an ABG?

28:23.903 --> 28:25.437
Baby, I had to tube this guy,
and there was no suction...

28:25.471 --> 28:27.139
Whoa, whoa, hey.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.808
It's not that
big a deal.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.810
I thought you were
on the chopper.
Oh, God, no.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.045
They brought their
own flight nurse,

28:33.079 --> 28:34.313
and the bitch wouldn't
let me fly.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.915
Oh, that bitch saved your life.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.116
Dr. Lewis, multifocal PVCs.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.250
I know, I know.

28:38.284 --> 28:42.121
Oh, I thought you were dead.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.322
Hey, hey.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.224
I scraped my back
a little, see?

28:46.192 --> 28:47.359
( laughs )

28:47.393 --> 28:49.428
Okay.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.134
The MacGill won't
fit through.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.435
It's all we have.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.904
I need something
thinner.
Like what?

28:57.937 --> 28:59.171
Anything.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.808
Dr. Kovac,
I need you over here.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.042
Where are your doctors?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.276
Coming from home.
It's Thanksgiving.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.344
Damn, I am so late.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.813
I've got to call a neighbor.

29:06.813 --> 29:07.847
Can we focus on this?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.916
Curved vascular clamp.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.920
Get ready with the ET tube.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.354
Tube her fast.
Sats are dropping.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.837
Bag her.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.271
This guy needs the OR.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.540
If we still have one.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.245
Keep pressure on the liver.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.579
Where are you going?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.181
To the OR. We
need Vicryl mesh.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.583
Okay, and bring a surgeon.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.952
A little cold
on your chest.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.119
Hard-hard to breathe.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.187
Because you collapsed a lung.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.488
How is Berta?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.457
She's in the OR.
We'll get an update.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.959
You have a cordis introducer?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.560
What's going on, Pratt?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.229
Penetrating neck developed
a dense right-sided paralysis.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.597
Vascular needs
to repair his carotid.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.866
No, that won't work.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.567
Ten blade.
Call surgery.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.569
The injury is too high.
Yeah? Let them decide that.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.104
32 French.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.472
Get me a c-arm
and a radiologist.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.274
No, your patient needs
to go to the OR.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.508
He'll be dead
by then.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.476
( alarms blaring )
V-tach.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.111
Charge to 200.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.846
Don't do it, Pratt. Clear.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.147
( zap )

30:17.316 --> 30:18.450
( coughing )

30:18.484 --> 30:19.919
Run of six.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.420
That's another 50 of lidocaine.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.855
She's about to arrest.
Where's the heliox?

30:22.889 --> 30:24.223
Mix up the procainamide.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.591
You think it's rhabdo?

30:25.624 --> 30:27.559
Yeah, the crushed muscle cells
are getting

30:27.593 --> 30:29.261
into her central
circulation.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.397
She needs an amputation.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.499
( high voice ):
An operation would kill her.
Her heart's too weak.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.901
I don't know
about that wedding.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.402
I need ice, lots of it.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.870
LESTER:
Subtract seven from 100.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.471
Uh, 93.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.040
Seven from 93.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.308
What are you doing?
Mental
status exam.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.509
Serial sevens.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.877
Neuro checks are pupils,

30:44.911 --> 30:46.078
orientation, and
grip strength.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.346
That's it.
You've got ten

30:47.379 --> 30:48.214
other patients
who need you.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.481
Excuse me.
86.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.649
That's good
enough for now.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.384
We've got a foot
lac to suture

30:52.418 --> 30:53.452
before it's six hours
old, and we have to...

30:53.485 --> 30:54.921
Chuck?
What is it?

30:54.954 --> 30:56.222
Chuck?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.191
Move the arm guy
into a chair.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.259
Neela, go get a doctor

31:00.292 --> 31:01.493
and a SonoSite.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.594
Lester,
help me lift him.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.930
One, two...
Wait.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.397
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.633
Okay, roll him.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.104
( alarms blaring )

31:12.138 --> 31:13.372
Suction.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.506
Open the
internal paddles.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.075
We need a doctor
in Exam Three.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.477
Try next door.
Start internal compressions.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.212
PRATT:
The guy is stroking out.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.513
I'd start with an angiogram.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.482
The injury is at the base
of the skull.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.417
The surgeons can't
get distal control.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.186
Dr. Pratt, can you come
to Exam Three?

31:27.219 --> 31:28.988
Does it look like it?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.990
If you don't put a stent
in this guy, he's going to die.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.291
I'm taking the SonoSite.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.999
Clear.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.333
Fine. Then let's
just sit around
until he's dead.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.002
Got ultrasound,
but no one's available.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.236
Hard to bag.
Try a jaw thrust.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.371
He stopped breathing?
Yeah.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.439
He needs intubation.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.685
Prep an 8-0 ET tube.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.988
Abby?

32:03.322 --> 32:05.057
I think the damn cords
are too anterior.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.358
You want me to try?
( gurgling )

32:06.392 --> 32:07.426
Oh. Roll him.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.394
Roll him. Roll him.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.395
Yankauer.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.429
His sats are dropping.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.502
Why isn't this...?
Can you turn it on?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.237
Turn on the wall suction.
Thank you.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.405
Heart rate's down to 40.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.008
Okay, stand by with atropine.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.011
Maybe you need a straight blade.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.357
Give me your hand.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.226
I'll open the crash cart.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.460
Backwards

32:41.493 --> 32:43.595
and to the right.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.431
Right...

32:45.464 --> 32:47.299
there.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.302
Hold it right there.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.504
Got it.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.605
Bag him.
Neela, tape.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.609
He's got a laceration
on his back.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.378
It could be an entrance wound.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.512
Sats are coming up.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.253
It looks like he has

33:07.286 --> 33:08.420
a metal fragment in his spleen.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.655
Lester, get me the rapid infuser

33:09.688 --> 33:11.323
and two units of O-neg.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.391
What are you doing?

33:12.424 --> 33:13.692
He needs a central line.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.427
Shouldn't an
attending be here?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.529
Yup. You see anyone around?

33:20.532 --> 33:23.402
The liver is wrapped,
still bleeding.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.636
Purse string it with 2-0.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.072
How do you know this?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.206
I used to be a
surgical tech.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.807
Oh, my,
what have we here?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.276
Liver lac.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.244
Hemostasis with Vicryl mesh.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.313
Excellent. Well,
I've got an open OR.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.747
Let's get him upstairs.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.084
Looks like
I'm eating cold turkey tonight.

33:38.117 --> 33:38.684
What time is it?

33:38.717 --> 33:39.818
Almost 5:00.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.687
Oh, man.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.656
Hey, you got a bolt cutter?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.425
Not up here,
but I'll get you one.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.094
Oh.

33:48.094 --> 33:51.097
You're lucky, Mr. Garland.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.464
Your burns are only minor.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.666
I liked it better downstairs.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.336
Only had pneumonia downstairs.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.474
Charged to 30 and clear.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.176
Asystole.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.177
Resuming
compressions.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.445
How long's it been?

34:06.478 --> 34:07.513
35 minutes.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.679
Okay, that's it.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.551
Time of death: 17:09.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.455
Close the thoracotomy
and find the family.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.489
His wife's in surgery.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.492
Hey, what did Vascular say?

34:20.525 --> 34:22.527
They never came down.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.463
There you go. Leave
three centimeters

34:24.496 --> 34:25.464
to cover the defect,

34:25.496 --> 34:26.632
one intracranial.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.167
Stent is in place.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.201
What did I tell you?

34:29.235 --> 34:30.235
To do the right thing.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.469
No. I want a surgery...

34:31.503 --> 34:32.771
Hey, look at this.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.606
Motor function in
the upper extremity.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.143
Blood flow is restored
to the brain.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.882
Everything's
good, Mel.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.851
Where's Dr. Lewis?

34:46.885 --> 34:48.487
Clear.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.455
( zap )

34:49.487 --> 34:50.589
( beeps )

34:50.621 --> 34:51.623
Sinus tach.
Got a pulse.

34:51.657 --> 34:52.791
Try for a pressure.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.326
Reina? Open your eyes, Reina.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.393
You think she'll wake up?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.495
I hope so.

34:56.527 --> 34:57.696
We still need an attending.

34:57.729 --> 34:58.764
Which patient?

34:58.797 --> 35:00.532
The flight nurse guy. Chuck?

35:00.566 --> 35:01.667
What?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.369
Abby?

35:03.402 --> 35:04.736
Occult splenic injury.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.372
He had a slow leak,
took him about an hour

35:06.405 --> 35:08.207
to drop his pressure.
He's intubated

35:08.240 --> 35:09.508
with a central line.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.177
Who did this?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.544
If you sign here,
we can say you did.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.281
It was either that
or let him die.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.615
This the spleen for the OR?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.450
Yup.
It's Chuck.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.918
What, your ex-husband?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.320
Yeah.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.621
Do you want
to observe?

35:22.654 --> 35:24.556
Um, I-I can't,
but I can bring him up.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.724
LOCKHART:
Last crit was 26.

35:25.757 --> 35:26.825
He's type and crossed

35:26.858 --> 35:27.859
for another four.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.461
BP's 110/70

35:29.495 --> 35:30.729
after two
units.
Abby, thank you.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.745
Is it over?

35:52.384 --> 35:53.652
Did he drop his pressure again?

35:53.685 --> 35:54.720
Any additional transfusions?

35:54.753 --> 35:56.322
Okay, good. Thanks.
Chuck?

35:56.355 --> 35:58.224
Yeah, he's doing well.
They're closing.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.958
And we're opening
to Trauma.
What?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.261
Sent nine to the OR,
five to telemetry,

36:02.294 --> 36:04.396
four to med-surg, and
I've monitored beds.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.731
Too bad it takes a disaster

36:05.764 --> 36:07.333
to whip this
place into shape.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.767
Ruptured globe's
going up to surgery,

36:08.800 --> 36:09.968
and the supracondylar girl
can follow.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.570
Okay, good.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.240
Abby.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.242
The fibroids involved
the uterine artery.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.809
I attempted
a myomectomy, but
there was no way.

36:17.843 --> 36:18.810
You did a hysterectomy?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.412
Yeah.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.281
She's stable now.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.782
Heard you had
your hands full

36:23.815 --> 36:25.717
down here.

36:25.751 --> 36:26.885
Good night.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.254
Hey, can I sign out?

36:28.287 --> 36:29.321
What?!

36:29.355 --> 36:30.556
You're a night shift nurse.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.723
Not until 7:00.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.492
Well, it's a quarter till.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.726
I don't believe this.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.328
I wrote these orders
six hours ago.

36:36.362 --> 36:37.329
Mom. Hey, Mom.

36:37.363 --> 36:38.364
Where's Helene?

36:38.397 --> 36:39.465
She couldn't pull in.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.799
Are those body bags out there?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.270
Did you see the crash?

36:45.504 --> 36:46.872
Well, it looks like

36:46.905 --> 36:48.474
home cooking's
out of the question.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.441
You want to go
to Ike's?

36:49.475 --> 36:50.642
Ike's?

36:50.676 --> 36:51.743
It's across the street.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.345
We're going out to dinner.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.580
You're still
coming, right?

36:54.613 --> 36:55.647
I don't think so.

36:55.681 --> 36:56.782
Why not?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.484
Alex, we're fine on our own.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.786
Mom, you said
I could bring a friend.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.821
Besides, it's boring
if it's just us.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.891
You're welcome to join us.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.793
No, I-I don't have to.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.562
No. Come on.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.805
Are you ready?

37:19.838 --> 37:20.972
Yeah, last stitch.

37:21.006 --> 37:21.973
Where is Romano?

37:22.007 --> 37:23.442
I haven't seen him,

37:23.475 --> 37:24.810
but I need to get
this guy up to CT.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.645
Let the nurses handle it.
Come on.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.648
Why in God's name would he
insist on meeting tonight?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.049
I really couldn't say.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.651
Time for our little
sit-down, Kerry.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.619
I'm a little
tied up in here.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.321
Where is Robert?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.655
I thought he was up
in the OR with you.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.789
Well, I thought
he was down here with you.

37:37.823 --> 37:38.957
Just fill me
in later.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.026
Ah, come along,
Dr. Pratt.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.432
Best if we deal
with this right now.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.835
Romano sent me a file
of your disciplinary letters.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.504
Yeah. Sometimes we don't
see eye-to-eye on things.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.473
Well, there's enough
documentation here

37:54.506 --> 37:55.674
to merit a suspension,

37:55.707 --> 37:57.643
I guarantee you that.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.645
Offending patients,
contradicting consultants,

37:59.678 --> 38:01.813
refusing to comply
with attending's treatment plan.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.516
Do you care to respond?

38:04.550 --> 38:06.352
Look, I may have been
out of line, maybe...

38:06.352 --> 38:07.553
Oh, baloney.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.388
Excuse me?

38:09.421 --> 38:11.557
I don't give any credence
to these allegations.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.958
If any of this
were true,

38:12.991 --> 38:14.960
I would get complaints
from other attendings,

38:14.993 --> 38:16.728
and obviously,
Robert doesn't care enough

38:16.762 --> 38:17.863
about this
to even show up.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.465
I saw you in action today.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.066
You're an excellent physician.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.635
Thank you.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.872
Give this to Romano
when you see him.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.778
Can I have French toast?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.380
No.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.781
Why not? It says
all-day breakfast.

38:35.814 --> 38:36.848
Because it's Thanksgiving.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.617
You're having turkey.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.487
Would you rather have
French toast or turkey?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.922
Um, I-I don't like French toast.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.492
Why not?
You like pancakes.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.794
Yeah.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.128
So... so does my mom.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.697
You guys

38:51.730 --> 38:53.732
can have pancakes;
I'll have French toast,

38:53.765 --> 38:56.702
and then we can share
some turkey sausage.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.473
Alex.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.874
Why would you do that?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.142
Payback.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.578
I'm sorry
I didn't get home in time

39:06.612 --> 39:08.414
to cook you Thanksgiving dinner.

39:08.447 --> 39:12.418
Excuse me.
I'll, uh, wash up.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.895
Why did you invite him?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.931
Because he's my friend.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.434
Well, you shouldn't have friends
who are over 30.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.901
Why not?
Because you're a kid.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.937
So? I like him.
He's cool.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.439
I know what you're trying to do.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.540
I'm not.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.542
And...

39:36.575 --> 39:38.610
I'd rather not be going out
with someone right now, okay?

39:38.644 --> 39:40.546
You're probably not his type.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.914
Besides, he's my friend,
not yours.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.987
Hello, Mrs. Marshall.
I'm back.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.656
The nurse came
with my medicine.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.491
That's okay.
I'm your nurse now.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.625
I thought you
were my doctor.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.093
That was
this morning.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.128
Now, I'm your nurse.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.930
This is a very
strange hospital.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.466
Tell me about it.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.468
Abby, I'm about to suture
an arm lac.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.935
5-0 nylon.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.604
I thought so.

40:05.637 --> 40:06.772
Abby, how much angulation
is acceptable

40:06.805 --> 40:08.039
on a fifth metacarpal fracture?

40:08.073 --> 40:10.041
More than 60 degrees
needs reduction.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.448
Hey, do you know who gets
the Blue Beacon admissions?

40:16.482 --> 40:17.783
Sessa, beeper number

40:17.816 --> 40:19.651
2956.

40:19.685 --> 40:20.986
Never received?

40:21.019 --> 40:23.489
No way. I brought
that down myself!

40:23.522 --> 40:25.457
Look, I said I looked
in the Records room,

40:25.491 --> 40:27.025
and it's not there.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.628
Yeah, well, Happy Thanksgiving
to you, too, jagoff.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.629
Hey, did Detroit win?

40:30.662 --> 40:31.630
I have no freakin' idea.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.164
Well, what about Dallas?

40:33.198 --> 40:34.800
Don't make me come over
there and smack you.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.535
One for Dr. Pratt.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.971
( women chuckling )

40:40.005 --> 40:42.173
Hey, Morris.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.975
What have you been doing
all day?

40:44.009 --> 40:45.477
Romano told me
to wait here.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.945
So you just
sat on your ass

40:46.978 --> 40:48.113
through
a mass casualty?

40:48.146 --> 40:49.648
Yeah.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.483
Your shift's over, man.
Go home.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.718
I can't!

40:52.751 --> 40:54.252
Are those
from Christmas?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.621
Uh, last year?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.088
The year before.
Dr. Greene.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.657
Mmm.
Which one's
Dr. Greene?

40:58.690 --> 41:00.091
I'm going to need
a massive amount

41:00.125 --> 41:02.260
of caffeine if I'm going
to make it to sunrise.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.529
Here you go, Abby.

41:03.529 --> 41:04.996
Ew.

41:05.030 --> 41:05.997
( all chuckling )

41:06.031 --> 41:07.599
Shred it.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.067
Ooh, look at this one.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.602
That's definitely 2001.
The Secret Santa party.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.038
Anybody hear
from Carter?

41:13.071 --> 41:14.540
He sent us a postcard
about a month ago.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.774
You should put that
up in the lounge.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.042
How's he doing?

41:17.075 --> 41:18.276
( file slaps table )

41:18.309 --> 41:20.111
I don't know.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.257
What are you
thinking about?

41:32.290 --> 41:34.693
Mm... nothing.

41:36.662 --> 41:39.164
Come back to bed.

41:53.945 --> 41:57.015
( singing softly )

42:05.123 --> 42:07.258
Hey.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.160
Hey.

42:11.830 --> 42:15.767
I should fake my death
more often.

42:15.801 --> 42:16.802
I knew it.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.104
What?

42:19.137 --> 42:22.608
That we'd end up together
tonight.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.610
( chuckles )

42:24.643 --> 42:26.612
This your idea of a hot date?

42:26.612 --> 42:28.313
Yeah, yeah.

42:28.346 --> 42:31.617
It's dark.
The nurses are busy...

42:31.650 --> 42:34.119
You just had
your spleen removed.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.155
Yeah... you know what they say--

42:37.188 --> 42:40.659
when you lose an organ,
the other ones get stronger.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.160
( chuckles )

43:06.284 --> 43:09.120
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

43:09.154 --> 43:10.689
Waiting on a few labs.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.123
I hate to pass on patients
when it's busy.

43:12.157 --> 43:14.860
Ah, that will change.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.663
Today was
pretty amazing.

43:17.696 --> 43:19.297
I've never seen anything
like it.

43:19.330 --> 43:22.000
I didn't think
we could handle it, but we did.

43:22.033 --> 43:25.170
We did really well.
We saved lives.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.138
It was like
a roller-coaster.

43:27.172 --> 43:29.975
I've always hated
roller-coasters, but...

43:30.008 --> 43:32.143
I sort of can't wait
for the next ride.

43:32.177 --> 43:35.146
Just as long as it's not
in the next 12 hours.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.115
You want a coffee?

43:37.148 --> 43:38.817
I'm not in the club.

43:38.850 --> 43:40.285
I got an extra.

43:40.318 --> 43:42.721
Thanks.
