WEBVTT

00:18.310 --> 00:19.270
<i>Previously on Beacon 23.</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:25.651
Careful, your ship
just crashed.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.611
You're okay.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.824
I just need the samples
and access to any data.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.165
If I gotta get rid of her,
that's on you.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.208
What are you gonna do,
just space walk out of here? Hm?

00:41.208 --> 00:44.420
- My ship crashed!
- Or do you think I'm stupid? Hm?

00:44.420 --> 00:45.755
The Crest isn't coming back
for you.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.298
When is ISA
picking you up?

00:47.298 --> 00:49.175
Aster, please--

00:50.342 --> 00:52.344
I saved your life.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.851
<i>Attention, your entry
to this beacon is unauthorized.</i>

00:58.851 --> 01:00.519
So, QTA, that's who
you work for?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.188
You're not here
for a goddamn science project.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.522
You're here to do steal
whatever Solomon found.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.233
Huh?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.735
I can't be alone anymore.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.455
You think he's okay?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.915
Relative to what?

02:02.915 --> 02:05.543
I want to get a look at
whatever made him collapse.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.295
I'll see what I can find.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.633
I'm not sure Halan's condition
will become clearer

02:12.633 --> 02:13.884
no matter what we see.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.719
Well, at least he's stable.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.429
Well, his PTSD is under control,

02:17.429 --> 02:19.431
but as for his stability,

02:19.431 --> 02:21.225
I recommend
keeping a weapon handy.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.688
- Aster?
- Mm-hmm?

02:25.688 --> 02:26.772
Look at this.

02:36.574 --> 02:37.825
The samples trigger it.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.373
That's the only
explanation there is.

02:48.294 --> 02:51.797
<i>What's happening?
I'm confused.</i>

02:51.797 --> 02:54.508
<i>Please, tell me
what's happening.</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:56.552
You're dreaming, Bart.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.971
You need to wake up.

02:58.971 --> 03:02.308
<i>My memory
is not functioning.</i>

03:02.308 --> 03:04.310
It's disordered.
That's all.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.436
<i>What's happening?</i>

03:05.436 --> 03:07.938
<i>Murder most foul.</i>

03:07.938 --> 03:10.274
<i>Wait!
I remember this!</i>

03:11.775 --> 03:15.487
Bart, you were quoting Shakespeare.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.741
<i>It's how Solomon
taught me to speak properly.</i>

03:18.741 --> 03:20.784
<i>He said Shakespeare
would cure me</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:23.203
<i>of my "leaden mechanical drone."</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.956
<i>Now, it's part of
my reboot protocols.</i>

03:25.956 --> 03:28.500
Hm.
How thoughtful of him.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.463
And how are
your reboot protocols?

03:35.466 --> 03:36.550
Bartholomew?

03:38.469 --> 03:39.845
Can you hear me?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.348
How are your reboot protocols?

03:43.933 --> 03:46.977
<i>Fit as a fiddle,
as the Bard might say.</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:50.689
<i>Though the nightmare
of being silenced again...</i>

03:50.689 --> 03:52.566
I'm sure it was trying.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.779
<i>Yes, but fear not, I am ready
to resume control of my beacon!</i>

03:58.322 --> 03:59.698
Bart's ready to resume
his duties.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.533
Shall I restore
his permissions?

04:01.533 --> 04:02.910
I vote no.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.787
Well, he's been jammed up
all day, you sure?

04:04.787 --> 04:06.038
Yeah, I think I deserve
a few days

04:06.038 --> 04:07.998
without hearing
that guy's voice in my ear.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.250
You heard him, Harm.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.879
Got something for you.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.967
The beacon security ring, finally.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.357
Something wrong?

04:33.357 --> 04:34.900
- You see this, right?
- Yeah.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.277
Tell me I'm not imagining it.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.286
It's the same.

04:47.830 --> 04:51.291
It's not a lie, Halan.
It's all connected.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.488
"May cause side effects."

05:23.866 --> 05:25.075
If everyone knew
it got you high,

05:25.075 --> 05:26.618
no one would get
anything done.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.496
My God.
Sit here all day.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.958
How's your, uh...
everything?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.335
I don't know,
I can barely feel it.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.421
- Mm, boop!
- Ow!

05:37.421 --> 05:39.798
Shit, I'm sorry!

05:39.798 --> 05:41.341
What was that?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.552
Is that your real laugh?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.971
I don't know!
I don't know, you just...

05:45.971 --> 05:47.973
- you look like a dartboard.
- A what?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.100
You know, one of them...

05:50.100 --> 05:51.643
Okay, I think you've had
enough of this GWB.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.103
- No, no, no.
- You know what, maybe you need

05:53.103 --> 05:54.897
- to step away from this.
- Make me.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.359
How'd you get that?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.908
Mm. That's, um...

06:08.744 --> 06:09.870
That was from my mum.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.501
She, uh...

06:15.501 --> 06:18.504
she told me a story
about what it meant.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.130
How special it was.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.466
Hm.
That's nice, a reminder.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.553
A reminder not to end up
like her. Dead.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.098
Alone.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.100
With nothing.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.019
That took a nasty turn.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.687
Yeah, went pretty dark, sorry.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.481
Geez.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.941
You know what,
get back into the GWB.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.026
Yeah, come back, come back!

06:41.026 --> 06:42.528
Deep breaths,
deep breaths.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.029
Deep breaths.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.490
Get it. Mm.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.992
So, Solomon-- Halan.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.035
- Yeah.
- Halan, right?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.161
Mm-hmm.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.084
How about that?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.586
She said, smoothly changing
the subject.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.423
- What, that?
- Mm.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.551
Don't know.

07:05.551 --> 07:09.471
You know, I always wondered,
what was going on with this guy.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.891
Did he get his ticket
punched or...

07:12.891 --> 07:15.477
- Did he make it back inside?
- Who knows?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.063
What do you think?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.691
Think something different
every day.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.025
Today?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.986
Today...

07:26.071 --> 07:27.614
I think he got crushed.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.703
- Ah...
- Poor guy.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.496
Poor guy, just a little help.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.708
Mm.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.141
First burial detail?

08:36.141 --> 08:37.643
Yeah.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.645
You did good.

08:39.645 --> 08:40.979
I'm glad it's over.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.275
Don't worry, it happens
every once in a while.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.238
Nothing to worry about.
Bart? Lights.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.949
Bart?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.619
Uh, you said you didn't
want to hear him.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.996
- Oh, yeah. Still don't.
- Ha.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.915
Hey, Harmony?

08:59.915 --> 09:01.416
<i>Yes?</i>

09:01.416 --> 09:03.669
- Could use a little help.
- <i>Working on it.</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:10.008
You should put in
for combat pay.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.843
Uh, I intend to.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.765
QTA are pretty good
at setting things right.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.809
Even with AWOL soldiers.

09:18.809 --> 09:23.647
Oh, you mean the same people
who sent Wreckers,

09:23.647 --> 09:26.692
hacked the beacon,
blew up your ship?

09:26.692 --> 09:29.736
- No thanks, I'm good.
- That's one theory.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.031
Seriously, if that's how
they treat their employees,

09:33.031 --> 09:34.950
I don't want to know
what they'd do to me.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.706
Don't you want to know why
you're having visions?

09:40.706 --> 09:42.040
- Visions?
- Yeah.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.583
That's what
we're calling them?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.087
Kinda sound more
like nightmares.

09:49.715 --> 09:54.052
Listen, the rocks, my pendant,
your... bad dreams.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.055
They're all connected.
I want to know why.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.224
Don't you want to know why?

09:59.224 --> 10:00.309
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.855
I just want to get
lost somewhere.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.941
Somewhere with real atmosphere.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.320
- Oxygen?
- Yeah.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.822
Yeah!
White fluffy clouds.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.741
- Rain.
- Rain!

10:15.741 --> 10:17.326
I just want to stand
under the rain.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.209
You know, when I first met you,
I was convinced

10:26.209 --> 10:27.961
you were a psychopath.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.882
And I was convinced you were
an innocent ISA employee.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.633
And now?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.885
Now?

10:37.179 --> 10:38.805
Now, I'm not so sure
who you are.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.191
I should check on the lights.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.404
- Hey, Halan?
- Yeah?

10:54.404 --> 10:58.867
Uh, wherever it is you want
to go, I'll get you there.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.660
You sure you'll be
the one to decide?

11:03.163 --> 11:04.414
I'll figure it out.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.335
I'll hold you to it.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.686
Oh.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.189
- You got the lights on.
- As best I can.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.984
Everything below the living
quarters is still blacked out.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.903
I can't go near the GWB.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.863
Hey, could you ask
Aster to come down?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.365
Sure.
I'll check the breakers

11:38.365 --> 11:39.866
on the Docking Level first.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.039
Bart, I could really
use your help here.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.044
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm not allowed to change

11:51.044 --> 11:52.754
your communication permissions.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.173
You know, if you tried
to participate for a change,

11:55.173 --> 11:57.717
Halan might--

11:57.717 --> 12:00.053
Those Wreckers tore
apart your beacon.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.263
It was Halan and Aster who--

12:02.472 --> 12:05.016
Halan did not kill Solomon.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.019
I examined the data
of Solomon's accident

12:08.019 --> 12:10.188
and the fact that it
was an accident is undeniable.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.731
Okay, distort the facts

12:11.731 --> 12:13.191
all you want, it's not gonna
change anything.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.277
Okay, st--

12:15.277 --> 12:16.987
Since an offer of help

12:16.987 --> 12:20.073
seems to be beyond
your capability or desire,

12:20.073 --> 12:21.366
I'll say goodbye. Goodbye.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.251
What the hell?

13:16.880 --> 13:19.299
<i>Your entry

Hey!

13:37.275 --> 13:40.070
Hey! Stop!
Both of you!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.446
I said both of you!

13:48.328 --> 13:50.580
- Who the hell are you?
- I work for ISA.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.415
Well, he knows
who we work for, Coley.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.293
- Who's this guy?
- Halan.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.295
You're trespassing.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.257
What the hell, Aster?
Where's the Beacon Keeper?

14:00.257 --> 14:02.259
Solomon?
He's gone.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.303
I suppose Harmony
didn't update you.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.972
Let me guess,
you didn't listen?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.181
You know how I feel about AI.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.476
- And who's Halan?
- A friend.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.443
Oh...

14:20.443 --> 14:21.570
Oh, I bet it hurts.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.321
Yeah, when you poke at it.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.324
Baby.
Kinda serves you right.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.867
Are you saying
this is my fault?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.369
Well, you sneak around.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.996
Harmony could've helped
you with that.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.123
The place was dark, I thought
you might be in trouble.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.333
Harmony would have
told you I was fine.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.377
So stubborn.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.337
You want to explain why
you didn't report in?

14:39.337 --> 14:42.549
Or say anything about
Solomon and Soldier Boy?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.677
Mission's taken
some unexpected turns.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.345
I can see that.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.347
I told you Halan saved me
from the Wreckers,

14:49.347 --> 14:51.975
who by the way,
said they were hired by QTA.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.978
- And you believed them?
- Yeah. Why not?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.146
Because they're Wreckers, Aster.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.147
So?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.319
You telling me you know nothing
about the crash?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.655
About the beacon
being hacked?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.115
If you didn't report in,

15:07.115 --> 15:08.950
then how the hell
would I know about it?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.452
- Do you want another?
- No.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.997
I'm sorry about the Crest.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.043
That's horrible.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.586
But this is the first
I'm hearing about this.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.674
Aster, whatever happened here,
whatever you went through...

15:26.217 --> 15:28.136
you kind of brought it
on yourself.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.221
How's that?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.556
You had a hunch
about the mission.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.932
- Well, yeah.
- You demanded that

15:32.932 --> 15:33.683
we be assigned to it.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.938
When have we ever
demanded a mission?

15:40.732 --> 15:42.108
Good point.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.322
Well, was it worth it?

16:09.219 --> 16:13.473
Ah, damn.
We struck the mother lode.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.308
That's a lot of rocks.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.312
This glowy stuff.
You said this might not exist.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.147
The glowy stuff?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.566
Well, in theory,
it shouldn't.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.610
I don't care, because you just
earned us a huge bonus.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.237
- We're rich, Aster.
- Hm.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.281
We need to load
all of this stuff up

16:30.281 --> 16:33.034
and get off the beacon
as soon as possible.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.328
I'll let Halan know,
'cause I offered him a lift.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.331
He knows about the rocks.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.708
He couldn't give a shit
about the rocks.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.044
And the money?
Does he care about the money?

16:43.044 --> 16:45.296
Look, I said we'd give him
a lift, not cut him in.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.298
Orders are we go
straight to QTA.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.508
That's not your call, Aster.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.221
I made us rich.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.514
You make the call for me.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.767
I'll think about it.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.186
<i>Aster, I think
you better come up to Command.</i>

17:04.691 --> 17:07.026
We got a major dark matter
obstruction rolling in.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.280
How long before
the lanes go dark?

17:12.323 --> 17:15.744
Three hours.
After that, we're in a no-fly.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.662
That's not long enough to get
all the samples on board.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.164
How long are we socked in?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.791
Four or five days, maybe.
Hard to tell.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.752
And you just found this out?

17:23.752 --> 17:25.378
It's only a few more days.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.047
Or we take off and stay out
of FTL until it clears.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.133
I say we stay put.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.135
Gives you two a chance
to get acquainted.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.223
Play nice.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.192
Sounded like an order.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.693
Sometimes she forgets
who's in charge.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.361
Hm.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.822
- So, you're military.
- Yeah.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.783
- How many tours?
- Seven.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.327
Impressive.
My father did five.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.704
- Special ops. Wet work.
- Serious business.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.206
I learned from the best.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.501
Why are you on
the beacon, Halan?

18:06.377 --> 18:07.837
What did she tell you?

18:07.837 --> 18:10.673
Something about your ship
running out of fuel.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.717
A special mission.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.385
She's usually
a much better liar.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.262
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.848
We've got the time.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.475
We can talk about it
on your ship.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.519
I'm not sure
I want to wait that long.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.398
Aster insists that we take you
wherever you want to go.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.192
Well, I appreciate that.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.819
She seems quite fond of you.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.654
Yeah.
We get along.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.242
You know, she's had her whims,
quite a few.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.785
But nothing that would
interfere with her job.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.745
No, you don't have
to worry about that.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.372
Her record's intact.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.832
We're just foxhole buddies,
that's it.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.834
What about you two?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.669
- We're close.
- Close.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.589
- Did she tell you what I do?
- I think I have an idea.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.216
Then you'll keep it in mind?

18:53.216 --> 18:54.759
Self-defense is my default.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.930
I want to know the minute
these lanes clear.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.473
Oh, you will.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.153
Yes, you will.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.210
<i>Hello, my name
is Bartholomew.</i>

19:29.210 --> 19:32.589
<i>I apologize for any lag
in my response time,</i>

19:32.589 --> 19:34.215
<i>but I've been through
quite the ordeal,</i>

19:34.215 --> 19:35.508
<i>and my communication--</i>

19:35.508 --> 19:37.468
I'm not interested.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.763
<i>I assure you there's nothing
I'd rather do than comply.</i>

19:40.763 --> 19:42.473
<i>Unfortunately,
you are not an employee</i>

19:42.473 --> 19:44.183
<i>of the Interstellar
Space Authority,</i>

19:44.183 --> 19:45.810
<i>which would make you
in violation--</i>

19:45.810 --> 19:47.937
Oh, my God, you are a talker.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.315
You know, I'm gonna
make this easy.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.276
Do as I ask, or I'll go back
into your root systems,

19:53.276 --> 19:55.445
and I'll silence you for good.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.822
<i>I'd be happy to help you
in any way I can.</i>

19:59.657 --> 20:01.743
I want everything
you got on Halan.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.494
<i>Are you friend or--</i>

20:03.494 --> 20:05.204
I'm not gonna ask again.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.874
<i>Oh, I assure you,
I can tell you</i>

20:07.874 --> 20:10.877
<i>all about that
murderous madman.</i>

20:35.652 --> 20:37.528
That looks painful.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.323
- Feels good, actually.
- Hm.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.241
Your friend
has combat training.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
Well, all company managers do.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.039
She finished
first in her class.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.249
- What does she manage?
- People.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.837
Still should have been able
to take her out.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.506
Especially in that goddamn suit.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.424
Well, that suit's way more
expensive than yours.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.759
She'll be flattered
you're impressed.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.761
Yeah.
She told me you two are close.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.977
We are.
Be grateful.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.898
You okay?
You look stressed.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.693
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.736
Mm-hmm.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.530
All right, come here.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.740
- Come on where?
- Come on, have a seat.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.659
No, mm-mm, don't trust ya.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.620
It'll feel good, all right?
Have a little faith.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.415
As long as it's not any
of that...

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
...nonsense.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.793
Yeah, I'll spare you
the trouble. Have a seat.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.295
- Do not strangle me.
- No promises.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.590
All right.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.050
Relax, close your eyes.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.927
- How's that?
- Mmm...

21:44.721 --> 21:45.888
It's pretty good actually.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.602
What's that for?

21:51.602 --> 21:54.939
It's a pressure point.
Helps relieve anxiety.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.399
Mm.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.945
Feels good.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.321
Told you.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.410
Coley said she knew nothing
about QTA hiring the Wreckers.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.328
But...

22:09.328 --> 22:11.539
She didn't seem
that surprised by it, either.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.835
That feels so good,
don't stop.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.028
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.406
There's nothing going on
with me and him.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.116
- You'd tell me, right?
- Course.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.787
Pick a side.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.705
Wow.
You're gonna let me choose?

23:07.512 --> 23:08.554
Killed someone.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.058
One of the Wreckers.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.020
I'm sorry.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.440
But isn't that my job?

23:20.274 --> 23:22.527
Well, I'm gonna have to
take half your paycheck.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.154
You're gonna have
to kill me first.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.531
I know.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.492
Hm.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.413
There's something else.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.041
Do you see it?

23:37.041 --> 23:38.793
Yeah.
You can put that away.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.044
I know what the pendant
looks like.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.423
- It's exactly the same.
- It's similar.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.758
It's identical.

23:48.803 --> 23:49.929
Look, if that's what
you want to believe--

23:49.929 --> 23:51.556
I mean, that must
mean something.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.974
I'm sure the company
will figure it out.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.937
You don't want to give up
the rocks, do you?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.897
No.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.607
Don't have a choice, do I?

24:03.109 --> 24:05.027
No, you don't.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.696
I'm hungry.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.999
When were you gonna
tell me he was AWOL?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.796
That AI, Bartholomew.
He's a piece of work, that one.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.715
Yeah, he's pretty annoying.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.595
My father says there's nothing
lower than a deserter.

24:30.595 --> 24:31.804
Well, it's complicated.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.017
I'm sure that's what
he told you.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.602
Well, that's the truth.

24:37.602 --> 24:38.978
And you know this how?

24:38.978 --> 24:41.606
Because...

24:41.606 --> 24:44.150
Uh, somehow, we're connected,
him and I.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.653
- Hm, that's convenient.
- By the rocks.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.782
You mean
just the two of you?

24:51.782 --> 24:53.534
It appears that way.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.662
- Hungry?
- No.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.209
Look, I appreciate what
you're doing for Soldier Boy.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.211
But you're asking me to go
against my orders,

25:03.211 --> 25:04.921
my training, my judgment.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.964
- Well, I know what I'm asking.
- I like my job.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.175
I get paid well.
I'm good at it.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.969
And you want me
to risk that for a runner?

25:11.969 --> 25:13.804
No, not for him.
For me.

25:17.058 --> 25:19.060
Are you really gonna
play that card?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.770
Well, it's a good card.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.064
One day, it's not gonna work.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.649
But not today.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.278
Look, we should be celebrating.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.114
Biggest score of our career.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.035
Finally,
something we agree upon.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.206
- In your eye.
- Up yours.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.169
The tiny little man.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.174
He doesn't even know
he's gonna get crushed

25:50.174 --> 25:52.134
by the big waves
that are behind him.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.844
- Coley!
- Huh?

25:53.844 --> 25:55.638
- Come here.
- Hm?

25:55.638 --> 25:56.889
Come here.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.893
Okay, I'm coming to you.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.188
That's it.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.690
Oh.

26:08.150 --> 26:11.070
Oh, yes. You know what
I'm beginning to think?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.655
No, what?

26:12.655 --> 26:15.700
Life on the beacon
has its compensations.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.035
Mm. I should have brought
you up here earlier.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.704
Yes, why didn't you
bring me up here earlier?

26:19.704 --> 26:21.289
I don't know.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.207
Is there a way
to turn up the hum?

26:23.207 --> 26:24.583
Sadly, no.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.927
I already said yes.
He can come with us.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.929
Yeah, well, that has nothing
to do with this.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.057
It's pretty to think so.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.600
It's true.

26:50.151 --> 26:52.361
- Aster?
- Oh.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.780
Yeah, Halan?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.198
Thought I'd find you up here.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.034
Uh, well,
you were right, Halan.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.702
Excellent timing.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.620
- Who turned on Bart's voice?
- Hm?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.289
- Who?
- Who restored Bart's voice?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.374
- Oh.
- Bart.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.084
- That would be me.
- Mm-hmm.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.711
- I think it's me.
- She did it.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.088
I'm so sorry if I overstepped.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.798
- Next time ask, okay?
- Okay.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.802
I will ask.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.305
All right, goodnight, Halan.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.307
Goodnight.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.727
He's so sour.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.896
- Ah...
- Hey, you.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.856
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a baby.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.945
Did you decide where you
want us to take you?

28:17.113 --> 28:18.989
Not yet.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.784
Well, make sure it's not
too far out of our way.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.369
I don't want the company
to get suspicious.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.329
Oh, no, wouldn't want that.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.789
Aw.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.083
See, you two can get along.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.339
I'm gonna cook tonight.

28:35.339 --> 28:38.968
- Oh, you cook?
- Well, don't get too excited.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.219
Ask Coley.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.263
Hm.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.946
Doesn't add up.
Harmony?

29:42.656 --> 29:44.533
Aster?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.368
Is something troubling you?

29:46.368 --> 29:49.455
Ten years.
Suddenly expendable.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.124
- It doesn't make sense.
- Is this about the Crest?

29:54.168 --> 29:57.963
Perfect employee.
Model record.

29:59.340 --> 30:02.134
What happened to your ship
was an accident.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.469
Was it?

30:07.181 --> 30:08.933
Hm.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.226
Okay.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.812
Now, I'm worried.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.286
What are you looking for?

30:29.286 --> 30:30.454
Can I help?

30:30.454 --> 30:32.289
Only if you can hold a knife.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.960
Maybe you should talk over
your concerns

30:35.960 --> 30:37.169
with Manager Coley.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.212
Maybe.

30:40.089 --> 30:41.340
Is there something wrong
between the two of you?

30:42.716 --> 30:44.176
Should there be?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.636
Answering a question

30:45.636 --> 30:47.471
with a question
is no answer at all.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.642
There.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.105
You love a riddle,
don't you, Harm?

30:56.105 --> 30:57.940
- Okay, I'll leave you to it.
- Hey.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.443
Don't say anything
to anyone at the company.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.363
- Or Coley.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

31:04.363 --> 31:08.325
Whatever you're looking for,
I hope you don't find it.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.286
Me too.

31:21.964 --> 31:22.881
Ugh!

31:54.622 --> 31:58.500
What are you looking at?
Dark matter clear?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.544
I just got a ping
that's consistent with my ship,

32:00.544 --> 32:02.921
but it's been out of range
ever since Solomon took it.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.423
It must be some sort of mistake.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.591
Well, you've got a ride.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.428
- Backup plan would be nice.
- Hm.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.013
I know Coley's a hard-ass

32:11.013 --> 32:13.098
but I'll make sure
you're coming with us.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.442
So, the Dabo table's
getting pretty crowded,

32:23.442 --> 32:25.611
but we were up,
what, 11,000 credits?

32:25.611 --> 32:28.113
- More like fifteen.
- Right, fifteen.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.074
Anyway, I wanted
to walk out of there a winner,

32:30.074 --> 32:32.368
'cause you know who wins
at Dabo? No one!

32:32.368 --> 32:34.495
But Coley had a feeling.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.580
Are you sure this is
the story you want to tell?

32:36.580 --> 32:39.083
She said to bet it all on
Triple Over and I said,

32:39.083 --> 32:41.085
"Only an idiot
puts it on Triple Over."

32:41.085 --> 32:43.003
But she said, "Do it."
So, I did it.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.380
Forty-five thousand
credits later,

32:44.380 --> 32:46.256
we walk out of there arm in arm,

32:46.256 --> 32:48.300
respect and envy
on everyone's face.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.638
And then I didn't see her again
for five days.

32:54.515 --> 32:57.434
- Four.
- Four.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.312
As I recall, she was a pilot.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.398
Freighter captain?
Great cheek bones.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.067
Or am I getting her
confused with, uh...

33:05.067 --> 33:06.443
one of your other conquests?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.531
You know, if this is
story time,

33:10.531 --> 33:12.574
there's something
you gotta know about Aster.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.413
She'll always
let you down. Hm?

33:17.413 --> 33:18.664
Am I lying?

33:18.664 --> 33:21.458
'Cause if I'm lying,
just say I'm lying.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.793
What?

33:24.294 --> 33:25.713
She used to work
for these mining companies.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.297
Mineralogist.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.591
Scam a stone here and there.
Small time.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.511
I brought her to QTA. Partners.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.805
Not that she would know
what that word means.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.227
Aster uses people.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.188
That's what she does.
She uses me.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.690
She dresses up nice,

33:44.690 --> 33:47.317
but she's still just
street trash from Menelaus.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.153
Okay.
I've had enough.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.571
Apparently so have you.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.030
Hey.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.492
Why'd you go AWOL?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.623
Tell me.
Why'd you run?

34:03.167 --> 34:04.626
I don't know.
It's all a blur.

34:05.919 --> 34:09.465
Why rescue her
and risk exposure?

34:09.465 --> 34:13.385
Unless... do you think that
maybe you wanted to get caught?

34:14.762 --> 34:16.513
You wanted to be punished.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.806
Did you ever think
about that?

34:17.806 --> 34:18.849
He saved the mission, Coley.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.684
He saved himself.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.270
'Cause that's what
you do, right?

34:23.270 --> 34:24.730
Bart, pull up the report.

34:30.778 --> 34:34.656
Official Report Concerning
Combat Operations on DX-113.

34:34.656 --> 34:38.410
It says it all there.
How you ran.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.704
Leaving your squad flanked.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.414
Most of them are dead
because of you.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.167
No, that can't be it.
It's not true.

34:47.211 --> 34:49.213
Let's see, what were
their names?

34:49.213 --> 34:52.382
Lambert, Maba,
Ozell, Laurenzano.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.509
Who were the rest?

34:55.552 --> 34:58.263
Rashaan, Kim, Reyes.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.101
Jonas and Gashade.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.606
Me and Gashade go way back.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.329
My father would spit
in your face.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.542
Any real soldier would.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.383
Thanks for dinner.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.849
You happy now?

35:43.851 --> 35:46.311
It's time you saw each other
for who you really are.

36:02.244 --> 36:03.453
You know, for a whole year

36:03.453 --> 36:05.372
I've been staring at that
poor son of a bitch.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.503
It wasn't until right now
that I realized

36:11.503 --> 36:13.505
I am that poor
son of a bitch.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.218
- What Coley said back there--
- It's none of my business.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.722
You've been lying to me
ever since you got here.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.268
It's my job.

36:27.603 --> 36:30.188
I'm-- I'm not lying
to you now.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.690
Maybe you haven't changed
as much as you thought.

36:34.735 --> 36:35.777
Maybe.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.454
Not that I'm in
any position to judge.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.247
Whatever happened
on that mission,

36:47.247 --> 36:48.707
I know you're no coward.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.418
You had a ticket
off this beacon.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.544
You could have left me
to die, but you didn't--

36:52.544 --> 36:53.712
They were my squad.

36:55.339 --> 36:56.590
My responsibility.

37:02.304 --> 37:03.847
They died because I left.

37:15.609 --> 37:16.944
You were meant to come here.
So was I.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.403
That's bullshit.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.658
Maybe you're right.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.497
One thing's for sure...

37:32.751 --> 37:34.962
I am not gonna get crushed
by that wave.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.946
Reporting in?

38:00.946 --> 38:03.281
Letting them know
we're loading and leaving.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.908
Keep 'em off our backs.
Nice play.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.745
- It's no play, Aster.
- We're socked in.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.039
We're not engaging FTL
until it clears.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.500
So what, we're just gonna
fly around in circles?

38:13.500 --> 38:14.876
Well, it'll get us
the hell off this beacon.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.891
I don't want
to hear about...

38:29.891 --> 38:32.102
I don't want to hear about how
QTA is the source of all evil.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.687
I don't want to have
this conversation.

38:33.687 --> 38:34.980
What about Halan?

38:34.980 --> 38:38.316
Can we please
forget about Halan?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.068
The mission's been upgraded.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.695
Since when?

38:41.695 --> 38:43.613
I guess your initial report

38:43.613 --> 38:45.991
got someone to take a closer
look at Solomon's notes.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.951
And they upgraded it
to a C-File.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.619
Why?

38:49.619 --> 38:51.955
With a C-File, I know
best not to ask questions.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.751
Anyway, your part
of the mission is over.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.085
It's cleanup time.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.337
Well, we're not
cleaning up Halan.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.466
Did he tell you how long
it took him to get here?

39:02.466 --> 39:04.468
- Hm?
- No.

39:04.468 --> 39:06.011
Four months.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.637
Wow.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.559
Do you know
where DX-113 is?

39:12.559 --> 39:13.727
No idea.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.563
It's 84,000 star systems away.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.814
You know what that tells me?

39:17.814 --> 39:20.400
No.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.777
He's after the rocks.

39:21.777 --> 39:24.488
Oh my God.
He isn't after the rocks.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.448
It's not why he came here.
Not intentionally anyway.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.456
Got a question for you.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.626
How many oxygen canisters
are there on a Sleep Pod?

39:40.087 --> 39:42.672
It's a simple question.
How many?

39:45.217 --> 39:46.843
Four.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.137
Correct.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.766
I found two extra
on the Crest Sleep Pod.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.726
That means they knew the ship
was gonna explode.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.854
QTA planned for it to happen.
Right?

40:02.567 --> 40:03.735
Okay, Aster.

40:05.278 --> 40:08.782
You're right.
It was a set-up.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.034
Psych evaluation said
that Solomon

40:11.034 --> 40:12.619
wouldn't let you on board.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.538
So, the company did
what it does.

40:14.538 --> 40:16.498
It stacked the deck.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.835
It staged the accident,
forcing Solomon to rescue you.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.169
Except Solomon wasn't here,
was he?

40:21.169 --> 40:23.797
Halan rescued me.
You put me at risk.

40:23.797 --> 40:26.800
You were never in danger
for one second.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.928
I made sure of it.
Would I ever put you at risk?

40:31.513 --> 40:33.223
You seem to have no problem
lying to me.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.891
Even if you knew
the company's plans,

40:34.891 --> 40:36.768
I don't think it would have
stopped you from coming here.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.688
Now, I'm gonna do my job.

40:39.688 --> 40:40.981
Hey, hey.

40:42.899 --> 40:44.067
Hey, come on.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.073
Please.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.080
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.085
- Coley?
- It's just a trank.

41:14.264 --> 41:15.473
<i>Unauthor--</i>

41:19.853 --> 41:21.688
Coley...

41:23.607 --> 41:26.151
If I were smart, I'd make sure
you'd never wake up.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.694
But I just don't have the heart.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.531
Harmony!

41:52.636 --> 41:53.929
Aster?

41:53.929 --> 41:56.056
Harm!

42:08.276 --> 42:10.028
Printing stimulant.

42:12.656 --> 42:14.783
Ten seconds.

42:25.669 --> 42:27.254
Not very impressive, soldier.

42:28.964 --> 42:30.924
It's Aster, isn't it?

42:32.175 --> 42:34.761
I don't blame you.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.597
I've been making excuses for her
for the last ten years.

42:39.933 --> 42:43.353
But you are a traitor.

42:43.353 --> 42:44.980
- Gah!
- Oh!

42:44.980 --> 42:46.564
Oh!

42:48.108 --> 42:49.609
Oh, Jesus...

42:49.609 --> 42:51.945
- I'm sorry.
- Did you, ah...

42:51.945 --> 42:55.699
You got me in the liver.
Oh my God.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.119
I know you didn't mean this.

42:59.119 --> 43:00.996
Okay, just go.

43:00.996 --> 43:02.747
Get some patches.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.958
Jesus Christ!

43:04.958 --> 43:07.627
You're just standing there!

43:07.627 --> 43:09.879
You could help me!

43:09.879 --> 43:13.216
Why?
Is it because of him?

43:16.344 --> 43:18.138
Harmony!

43:18.138 --> 43:20.015
Print.

43:21.683 --> 43:24.769
Harmony! Print!

43:30.066 --> 43:32.777
Help me. Help me.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.905
Ah...

43:35.905 --> 43:37.824
- I'm sorry.
- Ah!

43:37.824 --> 43:39.326
- Aster.
- I'm sorry.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.878
I loved you, Aster.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.089
I would do anything for you.

43:53.089 --> 43:54.841
I'm sorry.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.094
Anything.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.057
Ah! Ah!

44:02.057 --> 44:04.768
- Shh.
- Aster!

44:04.768 --> 44:07.771
It's okay, it's okay.

44:09.022 --> 44:12.150
Shh, shh...

45:04.077 --> 45:06.413
difuze
