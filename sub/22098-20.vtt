WEBVTT

00:21.772 --> 00:23.940
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:26.902 --> 00:27.944
We lost her.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.156
We did the best we could, but she's
dead. And that's all there is to it.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.743
It's you and me from now on, no
matter what. Just like we agreed.

00:35.828 --> 00:39.038
I just can't get her out
of my head, our little girl.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.290
She's so beautiful.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.253
You understand, Maya, that this
adoption requires absolute secrecy.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.421
You have my word.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.675
I'm leaving Galactica,
not you.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.176
I don't know how we can.

00:52.261 --> 00:55.138
I don't either,
but I know I'm gonna try

00:56.640 --> 00:57.849
if you will.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.936
I'm Brother Cavil.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.939
I understand you've asked
for religious counseling.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.357
Let's talk about
what happened.

01:06.442 --> 01:07.442
Chief?

01:07.609 --> 01:08.818
Ah!

01:09.278 --> 01:12.113
TYROL: I don't understand
how I could do that to Cally.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.322
BROTHER CAVIL: You think
you're a Cylon.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.907
I am not a Cylon.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.034
Well, of course you're not,

01:17.119 --> 01:19.162
but that's what
you're afraid of, isn't it?

01:19.621 --> 01:21.497
CAIN: We have our own
Cylon prisoner.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.250
NO. 6: She's obviously
been abused, tortured.

01:24.543 --> 01:28.337
I know a place where you can
stay, where you will be safe.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.007
Where I can look after you...

01:33.177 --> 01:37.346
Vice President Baltar offered the contents
of this case as proof of his sincerity.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.561
GINA: A nuclear bomb?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.314
I'm afraid that
I have no alternative

01:46.398 --> 01:49.358
but to announce that I am, as of
now, a candidate for the presidency.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.944
What should be
important to you, personally,

01:52.029 --> 01:54.405
is that Roslin's up
three points in the polls.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.660
SKULLS: Hey, I'm picking up
a large planetary body.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.704
Hey, you know what this is?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.165
It's habitable.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.502
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.920
ZAREK: We needed an issue,

02:09.213 --> 02:11.214
something to set us
apart from Roslin.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.509
This is it.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.137
Permanent settlement
on this planet.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.641
What took you so long?

02:21.725 --> 02:23.392
We got Marines and Raptors.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.311
We're gonna get you and your
people out of here, okay?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.437
Incoming!

03:29.793 --> 03:31.502
MARINE: Go! Go! Go!

03:31.587 --> 03:32.920
MAN: There's no way out!

03:33.463 --> 03:34.547
Go! Move!

03:34.631 --> 03:35.673
WOMAN: Get up and get going.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.049
They've got us zeroed in.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.634
If we stay here,
they're gonna chew us up!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.887
All right, we've got to fall back.
Position up this hill. Let's go!

03:40.971 --> 03:43.222
Let's move, people!
MARINE 1: Let's go! Let's go!

03:43.432 --> 03:44.724
MARINE 2: Let's go! Let's go!

03:47.102 --> 03:48.811
(SCREAMING)

03:56.028 --> 03:58.529
The jaw's set nicely.
You're done here.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.073
I'm kicking you out of here
and sending you back to work.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.492
Work? Like this?

04:05.120 --> 04:08.664
You gotta love a woman who can
complain even with her jaw wired shut.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.167
You got a visitor.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.474
I'm sorry.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.693
What I did was

04:40.197 --> 04:41.280
unforgivable,

04:41.907 --> 04:42.949
inexcusable.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.825
I didn't come here to...

04:44.910 --> 04:45.952
I forgive you.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.871
No, Cally, no.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.833
It wasn't you. I know that.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.504
It wasn't you.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.381
It was me.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.677
I may have been out of my mind
and not know where I was...

05:03.387 --> 05:05.304
Doing or anything,
but it was me.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.764
You're in pain.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.768
I know you've been in pain
for a really long time.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.436
Don't feel sorry for me.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.983
I care about you.
I always have.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.569
I always will.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.998
BOOMER: Move! Come on!

05:33.834 --> 05:35.126
Let's go! Let's go!
MARINE: Come on, get up!

05:35.502 --> 05:36.669
Get them up!
Get them up!

05:37.087 --> 05:38.087
This way!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.213
HELO: Let's go!
Get in there! Let's go!

05:39.631 --> 05:40.798
Let's go! Let's go!

05:43.677 --> 05:44.677
STARBUCK: Come on,
get in here!

05:44.761 --> 05:46.512
HELO: Get him up there!
Get him up there, now!

05:52.436 --> 05:53.853
Sharon, take the gun!

05:56.481 --> 05:57.481
Ammo!

05:58.025 --> 06:00.067
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

06:05.615 --> 06:07.575
STARBUCK: They've got us
boxed in here really good!

06:12.122 --> 06:13.122
Can't reach the Raptors.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.623
The Cylons have
jammed the freqs.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.293
MARINE: Frak!

06:35.479 --> 06:36.687
Are they still out there?

06:37.981 --> 06:39.106
Watch yourself.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.697
STARBUCK: Yeah,
they're holding back, though.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.407
Yeah, but why?

06:49.201 --> 06:52.161
They're holding position,
sending for non-lethal weapons.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.954
They want some prisoners
for interrogation.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.331
The rest they're
gonna send to the farm.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.917
STARBUCK: I'm not going back
to one of those farms.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.377
Yeah, well, you don't have
any choice. None of us will.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.130
They're gonna lob some gas in here and
then we'll all wake up somewhere else.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.174
Damn.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.717
So what you want to do here?

07:08.011 --> 07:11.222
Sit it out.
Wait and see if she's right.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.850
If she is, then you and me,
we've gotta have an agreement.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.104
An agreement?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.527
I'm not going back to one
of those farms, Sam. I'm not.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.906
So if she's right

07:30.951 --> 07:32.535
and they throw gas in here,

07:35.288 --> 07:36.872
you do me, I do you.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.166
What are you talking about?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.463
This is what I'm
talking about, okay?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.349
Yeah, okay.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.147
Okay.

08:08.196 --> 08:12.491
Down two more points, and this after
hearing his notions of social policy.

08:12.576 --> 08:16.620
Not to mention his wishful thinking
that he's calling security policy.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.832
Are people really
gonna be that stupid?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.835
Are they really gonna be
that shortsighted?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.045
TORY: He's got the only
issue people care about.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.589
Oh, I know. The planet.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.341
That's all anybody wants to
talk about is a frakking planet.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.428
Excuse my... My
language, Tory. I'm sorry.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.811
I know in my gut that settling on
this planet's gonna mean disaster

08:40.896 --> 08:44.899
for humanity, and I will not say
otherwise just to win an election.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.611
As you wish,
Madam President.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.368
So, I guess I should
start packing up my office

08:56.453 --> 09:00.748
unless you have some super-secret
back-up plan for victory in your pocket.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.461
There's always a back-up
plan for victory.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.054
Just in time for the priest.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.972
Oh, good.
Send him in.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.691
18 hours.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.278
They're taking their good,
sweet time out there.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.533
They could've overrun us
at any point during the night.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.412
They're up to something.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.081
What are we up to?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.126
Got any brilliant ideas in
that military brain of yours?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.461
We do the same thing
we always do,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.256
fight them till we can't.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.856
HELO: What do you think?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.525
Let's get
a recon crew together.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.110
Scout the area.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.154
Figure out what's
going on out there.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.842
Clear.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.777
They're gone.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.613
They just left.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.951
Thank the gods.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.666
It's a miracle.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.214
Let us pray.

12:02.222 --> 12:07.434
Lords of Kobol, we trust in your
benevolence and praise your righteousness.

12:08.311 --> 12:13.065
Give the people of this fleet
the wisdom to see the goodness

12:13.149 --> 12:16.819
and the strength of your
servant, Laura Roslin.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.404
Amen.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.003
Admiral?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.929
Madam President...

12:44.013 --> 12:45.931
The Admiral's not here.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.808
This is my meeting.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.645
I wanted us to talk privately,
without the press getting wind of it.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.439
Please have a seat.

12:58.027 --> 13:02.239
Well, you must have something very
interesting to say to resort to such

13:02.657 --> 13:04.950
pedestrian methods
of deception.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.999
The question
of permanent settlement

13:12.542 --> 13:16.086
may well be the most important
issue we face since the attack.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.343
I agree.
Good.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.723
The question should be carefully
studied before making the final decision.

13:28.766 --> 13:33.729
And the middle of an election campaign
is hardly the time for careful study.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.982
Therefore, I propose a truce.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.320
You and I will issue
a joint statement

13:41.404 --> 13:44.531
declaring that the question be
tabled till after this election.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.452
We will both pledge that
regardless of who is elected,

13:49.537 --> 13:52.998
the decision will be made only
after careful deliberation

13:53.082 --> 13:55.751
involving all elements
of the public,

13:56.336 --> 14:00.172
and after consultation with the
military and the Quorum of Twelve.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.719
Doctor,

14:06.721 --> 14:08.931
I know we've had
our disagreements,

14:09.474 --> 14:14.186
but this issue transcends
personal disagreement

14:14.812 --> 14:16.480
as well as politics.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.776
I am appealing here
to your sense of patriotism.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.871
Let me tell you, my sense of
patriotism is doing just fine.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.998
Thank you very much
for asking.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.794
I see it
as my patriotic duty

14:39.587 --> 14:41.922
to lead this fleet
to a new world.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.259
That new world is
unquestionably New Caprica.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.686
But thank you,
Madam President,

14:57.647 --> 14:59.565
for demonstrating to me

15:00.358 --> 15:03.527
just how desperate your campaign
for reelection has become.

15:03.611 --> 15:07.406
Were you with a blonde woman on
Caprica just prior to the attack?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.123
What?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.291
She knows.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.253
Were you

15:22.338 --> 15:26.341
with a tall, blonde woman

15:26.843 --> 15:30.721
in the Riverwalk section
of Caprica City,

15:30.805 --> 15:33.640
just prior
to the attack?

15:34.017 --> 15:36.059
She can see
right through you.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.561
Get out of here now.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.523
You'll resort to anything
at this stage, won't you?

15:41.608 --> 15:44.610
I'm afraid my affairs on Caprica,
and who I chose to consort with,

15:44.694 --> 15:46.653
are none of your business.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.864
You know, I saved your life.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.951
I won't save
your political career.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.711
We are not moving down
to that planet.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.962
If Baltar wins the election...

16:04.047 --> 16:05.339
Baltar won't win
the goddamn election...

16:05.423 --> 16:06.715
If he does, then what?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.884
We're gonna just sit
on this ship and rot

16:08.968 --> 16:10.510
while everyone else gets
to start a new life?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.512
Ellen, my job is to protect
the fleet from the Cylons,

16:12.597 --> 16:14.014
and that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.516
If you want to move down
there, go ahead, be my guest.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.685
Go down and cat around
with all the men,

16:18.770 --> 16:20.687
have yourself a good old time.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.649
Saul, I want you.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.569
XO.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.197
You got to be kidding me.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.242
I'll be right down.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.036
Starbuck's back.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.497
I gotta get down there.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.083
WOMAN: Put him in here!

16:41.167 --> 16:43.919
Hey, hey, guys, take it
easy with it. Come on.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.466
Am I good or what?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.302
There's gonna be
no living with her now.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.357
It's good to see you.
Welcome back.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.441
Thank you, sir.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.527
I brought some friends
with me.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.112
I see.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.948
Right, right. Um...

17:13.533 --> 17:15.409
This is, um...

17:16.494 --> 17:19.538
Wow. This is
Samuel T. Anders of...

17:19.622 --> 17:20.747
I know who he is.

17:20.832 --> 17:21.957
Damn good to meet you, sir.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.750
Caprica Buccaneers.
That's right.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.210
A hell of a player.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.337
Picon Panther fan myself.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.256
Well,
we enjoy beating them, too.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.008
It's good to have you aboard.
Thank you.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.387
I have news.
Good news, actually.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.056
The Cylon occupation is over.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.559
They left. They're gone.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.685
What are you talking about?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.478
BROTHER CAVIL 2: It's true.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.274
The Cylons have
left the Colonies.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.736
They're headed
for greener pastures.

17:50.820 --> 17:51.820
Security!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.321
What the hell?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.282
Code Blue!

17:56.659 --> 17:58.160
He's a Cylon.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.915
Back off, Chief.
We've got him.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.678
Well, this is
an awkward moment.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.931
Yes, he's right.
I'm a Cylon.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.642
And I have a message.

18:24.979 --> 18:28.148
So, take me to your leader.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.776
Take him to the brig.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.403
Take that to the brig, too.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.280
HELO: What?
Admiral, she didn't know...

18:35.364 --> 18:37.949
Don't even start.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.577
Of course she knew.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.211
Welcome to Galactica.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.516
Why the frak
didn't you say anything?

19:04.894 --> 19:08.563
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't want to.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.443
Or maybe I wanted him to come
here and blow up the whole ship.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.738
Is that what
you're looking for?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.074
Hmm?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.743
You don't mean that.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.541
Sharon, we'd finally got the
Admiral to start trusting us.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.917
Finally.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.545
And what?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.758
They killed my baby.

19:39.762 --> 19:43.265
You think I care
about you or us

19:43.349 --> 19:46.101
or whether the Admiral
trusts me anymore?

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
Hey!

20:12.253 --> 20:15.964
Sharon, I love you!

20:16.048 --> 20:19.843
And I'm not giving up this
frakking easy! Not after everything!

20:28.311 --> 20:30.312
Are you ready? All right.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.901
Aah!

20:39.822 --> 20:40.822
No, no, no, no, no.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.907
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.658
Hey, hey, hey, listen, you
don't have to get me drunk.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.036
I will sleep with you,
okay?

20:46.120 --> 20:49.122
I figure I owed you one, what
with you saving me and all.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.832
Little slut.
Shut up.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.674
Now you're gonna play hard to get. Yeah.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.389
My hero.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.020
Gods, I guess they'll let
anybody in here these days.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.188
Hey.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.107
Hi.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.361
Welcome back.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.904
Do you want
to meet my man?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.447
Your man?
Hmm.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.532
My personal property.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.784
Right, Sammy?

21:25.868 --> 21:26.993
Don't call me Sammy.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.286
Oh!

21:28.371 --> 21:31.122
How does it feel to be
my personal property?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.209
And before you answer.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.550
He loves it.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.053
I bet he does.
I'm Lee, by the way.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.555
Hey, Samuel.
I'm sorry.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.640
I've heard a lot about you.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.808
Pleasure. A shot?

21:49.892 --> 21:50.934
Sure, why not.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.311
Lee, when are you
gonna get yourself a girl?

21:53.396 --> 21:55.105
I'm doing fine, thank you.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.402
You're not still
frakking Dualla, are you?

22:03.406 --> 22:04.406
Thanks a lot.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.033
I'm not one to like, you
know, lecture or anything

22:07.118 --> 22:09.244
'cause I'll do just about
anything to get into the pants

22:09.328 --> 22:10.912
of some hot, little
young thing.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.372
Hey!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.461
Is that all I am to you?

22:18.546 --> 22:20.171
Yes, but you love it.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.008
That's right. I don't mind
doing charity work.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.267
You are a hot, little thing,
but you know that.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.685
Thank you.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.904
Where did he go?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.032
(EXCLAIMS)

22:47.950 --> 22:50.118
I'm here to deliver
a message.

22:50.286 --> 22:54.122
After that, you can do whatever
you want with me. I don't care.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.171
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

23:01.255 --> 23:03.757
I'm not a frakking Cylon.
I'm not...

23:05.968 --> 23:07.969
Oh. Well.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.430
Okay, then.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.935
Sorry to bust up
your day, Brother,

23:16.020 --> 23:18.063
but there's been
a change of plans.

23:18.147 --> 23:22.233
It's been decided that the occupation
of the Colonies was an error.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.864
I could have told them that.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.200
Bad thinking, faulty logic.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.410
Our first major
error of judgment.

23:32.495 --> 23:36.039
Well, live and learn.
But the war heroes

23:36.123 --> 23:38.917
have managed to swing
opinion over to their side.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.210
What heroes?

23:40.294 --> 23:44.506
A Six and an Eight. One of the
Eights you know as Sharon Valerii.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.842
Their voices carry
a lot of weight,

23:48.177 --> 23:51.888
so when they started talking about
our mistakes and our corruption

23:51.972 --> 23:54.265
and our need for
a new beginning,

23:54.350 --> 23:55.975
the rest of us
listened to them.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.186
You see, we're not like you.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.523
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid of change.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.983
So you abandoned
the Colonies,

24:04.401 --> 24:07.320
leaving behind a devastated,
nuclear wasteland.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.988
And we're supposed
to be grateful?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.950
Our pursuit of this fleet
of yours was another error.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.286
That's two, for anyone
who's keeping score.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.957
Both errors led to
the same result.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.417
We became what we beheld.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.169
We became you.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.712
Amen.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.508
People should be true
to who and what they are.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.718
We're machines.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.470
We should be true to that.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.390
Be the best machines
the universe has ever seen.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.602
But we got it into our heads that
we were the children of humanity.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.313
So, instead of pursuing
our own destiny

24:42.398 --> 24:45.483
of trying to find
our own path to enlightenment,

24:46.277 --> 24:47.902
we hijacked yours.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.779
You said it, Brother.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.739
My mission here
is simple.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.577
I'm to tell you that you've
been given a reprieve.

24:56.245 --> 24:59.873
Cylon and man will now
go their separate ways.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.583
No harm done.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.252
No harm?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.506
You completely
annihilated our race

25:08.591 --> 25:10.675
and destroyed
our civilization.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.386
Now, if you're gonna start
pointing fingers...

25:13.470 --> 25:16.222
Where did the Cylons go?
Back to their home world?

25:16.974 --> 25:19.350
Well, I'd rather not
say just now.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.478
Let's just say
we have other plans.

25:22.605 --> 25:26.274
New marching orders
by your one true god?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.401
There is no god.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.571
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

25:31.655 --> 25:33.865
for why the sun
goes down at night.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.659
At least that's what we've been
telling the others for years.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.621
We can't really prove it one
way or the other, of course.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.416
You know a way to prove it?

25:43.500 --> 25:47.921
Throw them both out the airlock. Let
them see if there really is a Cylon god.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.513
Ballots from the Adriatic.
D?

26:39.181 --> 26:40.932
Right. This way.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.788
MCMANUS: (ON RADIO)
It has been an exciting day.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.541
The election has been
a real rollercoaster ride.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.210
The polls now have been
closed for about five hours,

27:09.336 --> 27:11.963
results have come in, and
it's been a see-saw battle,

27:12.047 --> 27:14.173
back and forth between
the presidential candidates.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.343
So, all night long,
as we of course suspected it would be.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.596
We're still waiting for a few
more numbers to come in now,

27:20.681 --> 27:22.807
from the counting room
of Galactica,

27:22.891 --> 27:25.685
which, I must tell you,
as some of you may know,

27:25.769 --> 27:28.229
was the source of a bit
of a controversy yesterday.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.940
Councilman Zarek
had filed a formal complaint

27:31.025 --> 27:33.985
against the use of military...

27:34.069 --> 27:36.404
The military involvement
in the election process.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.157
Now, it's just reached...
A compromise was just reached

27:39.241 --> 27:41.200
late yesterday,
allowing Galactica

27:41.285 --> 27:43.619
to provide security
for the balloting,

27:43.704 --> 27:47.040
as well as
civilians to oversee

27:47.124 --> 27:49.542
and then to monitor
the situation.

27:49.877 --> 27:53.629
Yes, okay. Now we have some
more votes coming in here.

27:53.714 --> 27:58.843
Still not done, but what we have so
far is 6,282 more votes for Baltar,

27:58.927 --> 28:00.595
which puts his total now to

28:01.305 --> 28:03.514
21,569.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.682
Is that... Is that correct?

28:04.767 --> 28:06.059
And we also have Roslin.

28:06.143 --> 28:10.563
Her total now is at 17,754.

28:10.898 --> 28:16.361
We've had 2,981 more votes
come in for Roslin at this time.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.739
So that is how things
are looking at this point.

28:19.948 --> 28:24.410
We'll continue to bring you up-to-the-minute
coverage as the count progresses.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.930
Yeah, it's me.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.891
Is this a secure line?

28:48.644 --> 28:49.769
Okay.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.980
There are only five ships
left to report in.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.650
We need to move now.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.152
I'll take care of it.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.283
Lieutenant.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.828
I'll be right back.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.089
Are those the ballots
from the Zephyr?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.507
Yes, sir.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.092
All right,
we'll take it from here.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.927
We were told to take these
to the ballot room, sir.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.680
Counting has already begun.
We'll take it from here.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.680
GAETA: Right there, please.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.747
Last one.

30:52.142 --> 30:55.228
We have some more results
that have come in here now.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.646
And, uh...

30:59.566 --> 31:04.570
Wow, okay.
8,593 for Roslin,

31:04.655 --> 31:07.698
now, which puts her
over the top.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.244
That's 24,265
for Laura Roslin.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.453
Is that correct?

31:12.538 --> 31:16.958
And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.044
We're gonna check these again
because that has put her over the top.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.337
She... She has done it.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.005
She has retained
the Presidency

31:23.090 --> 31:26.842
in an improbable comeback in
the final hours of the campaign.

31:26.927 --> 31:31.013
Again we will, of course, like to
check those numbers if we could,

31:31.098 --> 31:34.934
but it appears that Laura Roslin
has retained the Presidency

31:35.060 --> 31:39.063
in defiance of the polls, the pundits
and the purveyors of gloom and doom.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.233
But I've never seen a
political race end like this,

31:42.317 --> 31:43.818
but it has just happened.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.070
I'm James McManus.
We'll check those numbers

31:46.154 --> 31:48.656
and we'll get back to you
very shortly. Thank you.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.662
I've seen
a lot of elections, Gaius.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.750
Most honest, a few fixed.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.546
And you can always tell the fixed
ones because they don't make sense.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.716
And this doesn't make sense.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.097
Laura Roslin is many things,

32:14.641 --> 32:16.309
but she's not corrupt.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.604
And she's not dishonest.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.858
It's over.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.156
Congratulations,
Madam President.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.867
Well, thank you.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.037
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

32:36.663 --> 32:38.372
but are you as shocked
as I am?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.376
I'm relieved.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.629
Well, you don't sound it.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.798
I'm just tired.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.092
It's been a long campaign.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.014
Colonel?

32:55.098 --> 32:57.099
May I speak to you
for a moment?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.774
What's up?

33:05.692 --> 33:09.236
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the Zephyr are wrong.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.239
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:12.324 --> 33:15.451
Dr. Baltar's name is spelled
correctly on these ballots.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.286
But this morning
the Zephyr called me

33:17.371 --> 33:18.663
and told me their ballots
had a misprint.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.040
They misspelled Baltar's
first name.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.750
We didn't have time
to print new ballots,

33:22.834 --> 33:26.253
so I told them on my authority
to go ahead, use them anyway.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.507
Baltar's name is spelled
correctly here.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.008
So they couldn't have come
from the Zephyr.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.426
They're frauds.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.639
Now, there's a complete chain
of custody

33:36.723 --> 33:38.766
from the Zephyr,
all the way into this room.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.519
So someone in the chain
is either the perpetrator

33:41.603 --> 33:43.104
or at least,
a willing ally in...

33:43.188 --> 33:44.563
Thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.273
I'll take care of it
from here.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.235
Yes, sir.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.530
We should at least notify
the civilian observers

33:52.614 --> 33:54.031
and the press
that these ballots will...

33:54.116 --> 33:56.450
I said I'll take care
of it from here.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.704
Yes, sir.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.222
Madam President,
you should celebrate.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.891
It's a great victory
and you've earned it.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.519
Excuse me.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.480
Admiral, we'll talk later.
Thank you.

34:26.940 --> 34:27.940
Adama.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.525
Yes, sir,
this is Lieutenant Gaeta.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.610
Sir,

34:32.612 --> 34:33.738
I don't know how
to say this...

34:33.822 --> 34:35.573
Fast and straight,
I'd advise.

34:35.657 --> 34:36.657
Yes, sir.

34:37.284 --> 34:41.120
Admiral, I believe that Colonel
Tigh is involved in a conspiracy

34:41.204 --> 34:43.789
to rig the election
for President Roslin.

34:52.841 --> 34:56.177
When I confronted the Colonel,
he admitted his guilt.

34:57.804 --> 35:01.766
He said he acted in collusion
with your campaign manager,

35:01.850 --> 35:03.267
Tory Foster.

35:04.186 --> 35:07.229
Saul said Tory had
contacted him a few days ago.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.026
He did it because he felt that Baltar
as president would be a disaster.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.028
I said I agree,

35:15.030 --> 35:17.364
but that what he had done
was illegal.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.409
A judicial tribunal
may have to be convened.

35:20.494 --> 35:21.577
Stop.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.208
I gave Tory the go ahead.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.419
I didn't know exactly
what she was planning.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.297
I certainly didn't know about
Colonel Tigh. Oh, my Gods.

35:33.381 --> 35:37.718
But I did know that she was
planning to fix the vote.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.304
You tried
to steal an election?

35:40.388 --> 35:41.597
Yes, I did.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.392
And I got caught.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.771
But Gaius Baltar

35:49.815 --> 35:52.691
cannot become President
of the Colonies, Bill.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.568
It cannot happen.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.111
Laura,

35:57.697 --> 35:59.323
I don't want him
as President either, but...

35:59.407 --> 36:01.367
He's working
with the Cylons.

36:03.411 --> 36:07.540
I saw him just before
the attack on Caprica

36:08.416 --> 36:11.377
with a copy of the
tall, blonde Cylon woman.

36:11.461 --> 36:14.171
The same model who
accused Baltar of treason

36:14.256 --> 36:16.173
before disappearing
from Galactica.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.967
What the hell
are you saying?

36:18.051 --> 36:20.052
Why didn't you
say something before this?

36:20.136 --> 36:22.930
Because I didn't remember
seeing him with that woman

36:23.014 --> 36:24.849
until I remembered it
when I was dying.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.518
I know how that sounds,
but it's real.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.229
The same way Kobol is real

36:30.605 --> 36:32.731
and the Tomb of Athena
is real.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.359
And the map to Earth is real.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.987
Baltar is working
with the Cylons.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.781
Even if that's true,
you have no proof.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.950
No, I don't.

37:06.558 --> 37:10.060
Do we steal the results of
a democratic election or not?

37:10.145 --> 37:11.770
That's the decision.

37:12.105 --> 37:16.066
Because if we do this,
we're criminals.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.278
Unindicted, maybe,

37:20.655 --> 37:22.448
but criminals just the same.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.283
Yes, we are.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.497
You won't do it.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.501
We've gone this far,
but that's it.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.170
Excuse me?

37:36.296 --> 37:40.174
You try to steal this
election, you'll die inside.

right to your heart.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.930

37:49.017 --> 37:51.018
We're gonna have
to live with it.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.359
It's the wrong choice.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.070
Yes, it is.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.077
All right, all right,
all right.

just like that.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.559
but not the war.

38:41.403 --> 38:45.489

error was discovered and corrected.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.909
You've been elected President.
Congratulations.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.079
Thank you very much, Admiral.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.457
Now about this error.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.085
Exactly what kind
of a tabulating error

38:58.169 --> 38:59.586
could have occurred
on your ship

38:59.671 --> 39:02.089
that could have swung several
thousand votes away from me

39:02.173 --> 39:05.217
in favor of your preferred
candidate, Admiral?

39:06.011 --> 39:09.221
As soon as I have the time,
there will be an investigation.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.765
I suggest that you
take your victory

39:12.600 --> 39:15.144
and you leave it at that,
Doctor.

39:24.529 --> 39:28.198
I think you'll find I can be
magnanimous in victory, Admiral.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.369
And I believe the correct
honorific at this time is

39:32.454 --> 39:34.038

39:34.456 --> 39:36.290

53:44.972 --> 53:46.139
Looks like I'm in trouble.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.724
Doc Cottle is here.
You're sick.

53:47.808 --> 53:50.018
You are supposed to be in bed.

53:50.811 --> 53:55.273
I would rather work this out of my
system right here than lie in bed all day.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.359
Sam, come on.

53:59.904 --> 54:00.987
Come on.

54:01.447 --> 54:02.488
Duty calls.

54:02.615 --> 54:03.698
PLAYER 1: Hey,
you gotta be tough.

54:03.782 --> 54:05.199
(COUGHING) PLAYER 2:
Where you going, Anders?

54:05.284 --> 54:07.076
Tomorrow, man.
Same time, same score.

54:07.161 --> 54:08.912
PLAYER 2: Send us
another player then.

54:08.996 --> 54:11.748
I can't believe I married
a moron. Are you okay?

54:11.874 --> 54:13.124
(COUGHING)
I'm fine.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.500
I'm fine.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.295
PLAYER 3: Let's go!
Let's go!

54:28.349 --> 54:29.349
Ah.

54:32.353 --> 54:34.270
STARBUCK:
I'll be right back, okay?

54:36.357 --> 54:37.857
Hey, Doc, wait.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.275
So?

54:40.778 --> 54:42.779
There's fluid in the lungs.

54:43.364 --> 54:44.739
It's probably pneumonia.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.407
So give him something.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.368
I'd love to.

54:48.452 --> 54:50.870
I've been out of antibiotics for months.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.582
So what, that's it?

54:55.167 --> 54:56.584
I have a lot of patients
to see,

54:56.669 --> 54:58.419
but he's young
and he's strong.

54:58.504 --> 55:00.755
So, make him rest,
keep him warm

55:00.839 --> 55:03.174
and with a little luck,
he'll make it.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.055
Son of a bitch.

55:30.244 --> 55:31.828
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

55:31.912 --> 55:33.871
TYROL: Please, just calm down.

55:33.956 --> 55:36.332
Everybody listen,
just for a second.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.420
Please. Please. Be quiet!

55:45.259 --> 55:47.969
Hey! Shut the frak up!

55:51.473 --> 55:53.933
When you elected me
union President,

55:54.101 --> 55:56.019
I promised
I would keep us working.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.146
Keep benefits flowing,
but most of all,

55:58.230 --> 56:00.231
keep this city alive...
Colonel!

56:00.649 --> 56:01.649
Hey!

56:02.568 --> 56:04.193
TYROL: I promised
we would stay on the job.

56:04.278 --> 56:05.695
TIGH: Wow, look at you.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.780
Hi.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.490
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys are here.

56:09.575 --> 56:10.658
Me, too.

56:10.743 --> 56:12.910
It's pretty,
pretty exciting.

56:12.995 --> 56:14.287
Yeah, that wears off.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.080
So what's going on here?

56:16.790 --> 56:18.374
President Baltar.

56:18.459 --> 56:21.335
TYROL: Men, women and children
are dependent on our...

56:21.420 --> 56:24.297
Sir, Anders is really sick.

56:25.716 --> 56:27.300
Doc Cottle's giving me
the runaround.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.926
Says there's no antibiotics.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.887
It's a load of crap.

56:31.805 --> 56:34.432
Anything you can do to help
me cut through the red tape?

56:34.516 --> 56:36.100
You should give Apollo a call.

56:36.185 --> 56:39.145
Pegasus is sitting on
the backup meds.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.481
He'd spring some for you.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.025
Yeah, I doubt that.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.486
That was a long time ago.

56:47.488 --> 56:48.780
People change.

56:49.156 --> 56:52.992
TYROL: Health benefits,
rations and fair compensation.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.036
Yes, we have
a vital responsibility.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.162
Okay.

56:56.455 --> 56:59.373
There comes a time
when you realize

56:59.583 --> 57:03.711
that the engine you've built
with your blood and your sweat

57:03.796 --> 57:07.173
and your tears is being used
for something so foul,

57:07.257 --> 57:09.008
so perverted

57:09.343 --> 57:11.427
that it makes you sick
in your heart.

57:11.512 --> 57:14.013
And it's then that you must
throw your body on the gears

57:14.098 --> 57:17.100
and on the levers and on the
machine itself and make it stop.

57:17.184 --> 57:19.352
And we have to show
the people who run it,

57:19.436 --> 57:22.605
the people who control it,
that unless we're free,

57:22.689 --> 57:25.650
that machine will be prevented
from working at all!

57:29.404 --> 57:32.240
ALL: (CHANTING) Strike!
Strike! Strike! Strike!

57:35.369 --> 57:37.161
ROSLIN: Okay, everybody
have that so far?

57:37.246 --> 57:38.704
CHILDREN: Yeah.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.498
Good, you're listening.

57:41.708 --> 57:44.877
Think the President has a
bit of a problem on his hands.

57:45.546 --> 57:47.713
I also want you
to look at Chapter 10,

57:47.798 --> 57:49.507
it's the history
of the 12 Colonies.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.300
It's really interesting.

57:51.760 --> 57:55.555
The President's problems
are not our problems, right?

57:56.014 --> 57:57.306
MAYA: That's right.

57:57.391 --> 58:00.935
Our problems are homework
for everyone tonight.

58:01.019 --> 58:02.478
(CHILDREN GROANING)

58:05.816 --> 58:07.984
Now some of you are
going to stay and help me

58:08.068 --> 58:10.403
with the art project
for the presentation.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.446
Everyone else,
your parents are here.

58:12.531 --> 58:14.699
Get your stuff, let's go!
Go on, get out of here!

58:14.783 --> 58:16.450
MAYA: Bye, bye.
ROSLIN: Good job!

58:16.910 --> 58:19.078
Yeah, okay.
Bye, honey, thanks.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.164
Good job. Good job.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.166
CHILD: I finished again...

58:23.250 --> 58:24.500
WOMAN: That's wonderful.

58:24.585 --> 58:26.169
ROSLIN: Thank you, parents!

58:26.587 --> 58:28.171
You know what?

58:28.255 --> 58:31.841
Why don't you take the baby and
go on, okay? I'll finish up here.

58:31.925 --> 58:33.092
You sure?
Yes.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.594
Yes, go ahead.

58:37.014 --> 58:40.600
A bubblehead. I love this.
Are you staying?

58:40.976 --> 58:43.352
Okay, everybody with an art
project, bring it up here!

58:43.437 --> 58:45.771
Hello, Isis. Oh...

59:07.628 --> 59:09.253
WOMAN: (OVER SPEAKER)
Section 7 power grid

59:09.338 --> 59:11.631
is temporarily shut down
for repairs.

59:41.286 --> 59:42.828
Hey, what's going on?

59:43.413 --> 59:44.413
It's for you.

59:44.498 --> 59:45.539
Who is it?

59:45.624 --> 59:46.791
It's for you.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.084
Who is it?

59:52.464 --> 59:53.756
Right.

59:57.719 --> 59:59.345
APOLLO: What do you want?

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:04.433
I need a favor.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:08.271
Is that right?

1:00:09.523 --> 1:00:14.402
I hear that you're hoarding a
bunch of antibiotics for the pilots.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:17.405
Where did you hear that?

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:23.869
Anders is sick.
He has pneumonia, Lee.

1:00:25.038 --> 1:00:27.915
I think that he might die.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:32.878
Commander?

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:34.714
Wait one...

1:00:34.881 --> 1:00:36.465
Yeah, lieutenant.
What is it?

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:37.842
I'm not sure.

1:00:37.926 --> 1:00:40.052
I'm picking up something
on dradis.

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:44.515
Dradis? How can you see
anything in that soup? I mean...

1:00:48.437 --> 1:00:50.062
There it is.
What is it?

1:00:51.898 --> 1:00:53.357
Wait, what is that?

1:01:00.407 --> 1:01:01.782
Oh, my Gods!

1:01:02.284 --> 1:01:03.868
It's a Cylon fleet.

1:01:05.746 --> 1:01:07.079
They found us.

1:01:07.247 --> 1:01:08.414
They found us.

1:01:14.755 --> 1:01:16.672
APOLLO: We have to get
out of here, sir.

1:01:16.757 --> 1:01:18.591
We can't just leave
all those people behind.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:19.884
There's nothing we can do.

1:01:19.968 --> 1:01:22.678
It's taking us forever just to
get to action stations over here.

1:01:22.763 --> 1:01:24.388
We're in no shape
for a fight, sir.

1:01:24.473 --> 1:01:26.265
They'll be wiped out.

1:01:26.725 --> 1:01:30.269
We don't have a choice. We need
to get out of here, right now!

1:01:31.438 --> 1:01:34.357
All decks finally report
condition one, sir.

1:01:34.441 --> 1:01:36.484
Should we launch
the alert fighters?

1:01:41.823 --> 1:01:42.865
No.

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:45.868
Begin jump prep.
We're leaving.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.788
But we'll be back.

1:01:49.456 --> 1:01:50.873
Start your prep.

1:02:01.093 --> 1:02:03.594
Mr. President! Mr. President!

1:02:05.305 --> 1:02:07.223
Don't you knock?
GAETA: Gaius!

1:02:07.641 --> 1:02:09.100
Gaius!
Yeah, what is it?

1:02:09.184 --> 1:02:11.227
The Cylons just jumped
into orbit

1:02:12.229 --> 1:02:14.063
and the Fleet's jumped away.

1:02:29.788 --> 1:02:31.288
Judgment day.

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:11.078
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

1:04:32.744 --> 1:04:34.954
I am Gaius Baltar,

1:04:38.124 --> 1:04:40.209
President of the Colonies.

1:04:40.794 --> 1:04:42.545
I know who you are, Gaius.

1:04:46.841 --> 1:04:48.300
I know very well.

1:04:51.304 --> 1:04:53.806
As long as you offer
no resistance,

1:04:55.183 --> 1:04:56.809
you won't be harmed.

1:05:05.485 --> 1:05:06.694
How do I know that?

1:05:06.778 --> 1:05:08.112
You don't.

1:05:09.656 --> 1:05:11.574
You also don't have
any choice.

1:05:23.295 --> 1:05:24.795
How did you find us?

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:28.924
Oh, it was
quite by accident, actually.

1:05:30.010 --> 1:05:31.594
We were over a light year
away from here

1:05:31.678 --> 1:05:35.723
when we detected
the radiation signature

1:05:35.807 --> 1:05:37.516
of a nuclear detonation.

1:05:59.372 --> 1:06:00.581
Very well.

1:06:01.875 --> 1:06:04.543
On behalf of the people
of the 12 Colonies,

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:07.796
I surrender.

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:53.967
What do you want to do now,
Captain?

1:06:56.888 --> 1:06:59.098
The same thing we always do.

1:07:00.809 --> 1:07:02.559
Fight them until we can't.
