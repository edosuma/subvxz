(DINOSAURS GROWLING)

10:05.605 --> 10:07.272
Do we lock it?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.907
(PANTING) No need.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.276
Those dinosaurs are
worthless when it comes
to opening doors.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.078
Trust me.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.313
See, they'll never
get us in here.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.150
Oh, good boy! You did it!

10:19.952 --> 10:21.953
(GROWLS)

10:22.421 --> 10:23.888
Uh-oh.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.057
