00:02.235 --> 00:03.391
.

00:03.392 --> 00:04.547
- I don't know what you heard,
but let set things straight.

00:04.548 --> 00:05.703
In order to get my job back,

00:05.705 --> 00:08.507
I put myself out there
as dirty.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.710
I never agreed, nor did i ever
report on another cop.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.279
- I know what you're feeling.
- You don't.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.347
- Erin.
- Hey, mom.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.184

- Great.

00:19.186 --> 00:19.451
- Let me see your hands!
- Put 'em up!

00:24.525 --> 00:27.326
- Oskar bembenek just put
$100,000 bounty on your head

00:27.328 --> 00:31.030
For killing
his brother jacob.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.798
- I'm just saying, jake,
you got a target on your head

00:32.800 --> 00:35.000
And you don't seem
too phased.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.201
- Overseas, my unit and i,
we always had a bounty on us.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.737
- Most gangs only pay 10 g
for a cop.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.706
If you're really worth 100,
i should take you out myself.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.241
Pay off my mortgage.
- Try it.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.243

00:46.247 --> 00:47.646
- What?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.281
- How'd you handle that?

00:49.283 --> 00:52.217
- Well, you dust yourself.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.053
Never go home
the same way twice.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.388
Run red lights.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.625
If a car follows you through
one, you chamber around

00:59.627 --> 01:02.494
And you handle business.

01:02.496 --> 01:05.096
- All right.
- Right?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.799
- This is billy fagan.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.468
Small time hood had ties
to a local outfit.

01:10.571 --> 01:14.273
I've run into him
a couple of times.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.509
This is billy fagan
seven hours ago.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.778
Organized crime found a dollar
bill pinned to his chest.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.614
They looked into the serbians,
the cartels, coming up empty.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.249
- We taking this
from organized crime

01:24.251 --> 01:26.385
Because he was your poker buddy?

01:29.857 --> 01:32.124
- Start reaching
out to your c.I.'s.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.394
You got a sec?

01:41.402 --> 01:42.468
You got something
to say to me,

01:42.470 --> 01:44.169
Don't air it out
in the bullpen.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.404
- Sounds good.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.506
- You don't have to like
what i did.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.108
But you do have
to follow orders,

01:49.110 --> 01:50.709
Or you can put in
for a transfer.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.112
- For the last 10 years,
you've told me i.A.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.379
Is a bunch of rats
who hide behind their badge

01:54.381 --> 01:55.814
Instead of standing
in front of it.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.683
- And i meant it.
Cops who go after other cops

01:57.685 --> 02:00.752
Are the lowest.
I never did that.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.689
I played a game
with them to get my job back.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.425
A game i won, i might add.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.860
- You know, i remember the day
you and camille took me in.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.597
It was november 13th.
I was 15.

02:11.599 --> 02:15.334
And in our house, we were
supposed to trust each other.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.302
So, i've told you everything.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.539
Good, bad, ugly.
Illegal.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.274
I have laid all of it out.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.811
You should've told me.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.379
Because i would've told you.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.281
- Erin.

Come on in.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.656
- You know a nick marcello?
- Yeah, why?

03:00.581 --> 03:05.250
- Hank!
[sobbing]

03:05.252 --> 03:07.586
- So sorry.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.959
You have to stay here, trish.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.561
- Okay.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.535
[birds cooing]

03:36.717 --> 03:38.483
- You two were close?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.285
- Yeah.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.590
Grew up together.

04:11.452 --> 04:11.683
.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.419
- I was out shopping.
I came home.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.922
Nick always feeds his pigeons
in the morning.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.791
- Any idea
who could've done this?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.726
Business associates?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.363
- I know what you're implying,

04:24.365 --> 04:28.667
But nick has been retired
from that life for a long time.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.802
The name billy fagan mean
anything to you?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.938
He was found last night,
killed the same way.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.007
- No.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.879
- Can you give us a minute?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.682
- Yeah.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.622
- Maria and nick jr.?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.891
- At my mom's.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.028
They don't know yet.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.502
- Trish, i'm not here as a cop.
Me and nick had a history,

05:03.504 --> 05:06.905
You know that.

05:06.907 --> 05:10.475
I just want to find
whoever's doing this.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.946
Look, if nick had a problem
with anyone,

05:14.948 --> 05:17.316
You need to tell me now.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.423
- There was someone.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.933
- Brent norelli.
Assault, armed robbery.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.469
Even did six months
at the cook county psych ward.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.104
Norelli
inherited this lumber yard

05:39.106 --> 05:41.406
From his old man,
but it's just a front.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.042
He just broke off
from the outfit old-timers,

05:44.044 --> 05:47.379
But he's already making plays
for some of their rackets.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.481
Let's go.

06:21.949 --> 06:25.050

06:25.052 --> 06:28.754
- He's in the store room.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.456
Unh!

06:35.963 --> 06:38.096
- Chicago police!
[gunfire]

06:43.637 --> 06:47.072
- Unh!

06:47.074 --> 06:49.107

Drop it! Drop it now!

06:55.849 --> 06:58.116
- Billy fagan
and nick marcello.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.386
- I think i got a broken rib.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.687
- You unload an ak at us,
you're lucky that's all you got.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.627
- Hank voight, right?
- That's right.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.430
- Yeah.
I heard about you.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.967
- Meaning?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.502
- I just heard about you?

07:17.504 --> 07:19.704
- Yeah?

07:19.706 --> 07:22.541
[slams fist against wall]
- billy fagan and nick marcello?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.042
- I told you.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.977
Did i give them geriatrics
a warning

07:25.979 --> 07:27.179
I was planting my flag?

07:27.181 --> 07:31.082
Yeah.
But i didn't gauge them, man.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.084
My father taught me
a little more respect than that.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.589
I thought you was a crew
coming to try and shotgun me.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.925
[knock at door]

07:41.495 --> 07:43.128
- Casino security on
the riverboat out in elgin

07:43.130 --> 07:44.930
Just sent me this footage.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.965
He was playing
a marathon session of blackjack

07:46.967 --> 07:51.536
During both murders
occurred, so...

07:51.538 --> 07:55.006
- Just like i said.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.909
I lost 20 grand
on that boat.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.613
Talk about a real crime.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.682
- Throw him in the cage, anyway.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.920
- One blast of
double ought buckshot

08:08.922 --> 08:10.922
Killed both fagan
and marcello.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.757
No shells were found
at either murder.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.192
Crime scene estimates
the killer's height

08:14.194 --> 08:15.994
Based on blood splatter
to be 5'10",

08:15.996 --> 08:18.196
Which narrows it down.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.898
- There was
no forced entry to any

08:19.899 --> 08:21.599
Of the doors or windows
in marcello's building.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.034
There's a fire escape
in the back,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.169
But it doesn't lead
to the roof.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.170
You'd have to climb
up from there,

08:25.172 --> 08:26.638
Which is not an easy feat.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.039
But it's the only
that somebody

08:28.041 --> 08:29.174
Could've come and gone
unnoticed.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.176
- How long have you
been doing this?

08:31.178 --> 08:34.212
All right, and how many
shotgun murders

08:34.214 --> 08:37.048
Have we seen
before these?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.683
- Two.
- All right, so...

08:39.686 --> 08:40.885
It's gotta be a pro.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.153
- Or a redneck.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.789
- Pro redneck.
I'm calling it.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.732
- I could've just
emailed this to you.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.166
- Yeah, my boss is old school.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.102
He doesn't much like
electronic footprints.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.704
- We're cool now.
- Well, we're getting there.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.239
- Dude, it was just
some graffiti.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.275
- You tagged the entire
scoreboard at cellular field.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.076
That's a class three
felony.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.278
- Like i said, you got
a little more work to do,

09:06.280 --> 09:07.546
But this?

09:07.548 --> 09:10.782
It's a good start.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.317
All right, all right.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.654
I did financial forensics
on our two shotgun victims.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.988
- He farmed it out,
i guarantee it.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.960
- Ahem. Fagan and marcello
were partners

09:21.962 --> 09:24.329
In a shell company.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.298
Maxwell investments.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.966
They loan money
out at astronomical--

09:27.968 --> 09:30.168
- Loan sharks.
- I was gonna get to that.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.736
Thank you, alvin.
Ahem.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.738
Their latest client
just signed over

09:33.740 --> 09:36.708
His dry cleaning business
a week ago.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.344
One dale hansen.
Owned fine choice cleaners.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.146
Two locations,
one on north broadway,

09:41.148 --> 09:42.213
A second on west belmont.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.282
Is that fast enough
for you, al?

09:44.284 --> 09:48.053
- All right, you and halstead go
pay this dry cleaner a visit.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.855
I got someone else
i want to talk to.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.896
- Hank.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.131
I know you and nick marcello
were friends.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.333
- Let me guess.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.034
You got an opinion
about that, too.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.004
- I just wanted to say
i'm sorry.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.339
It was always
a lot of laughs

10:07.341 --> 10:09.107
When him and tricia would
come over for dinner.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.241
- Hmm.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.711
- He was a real nice guy.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.180
And i liked him.

10:32.366 --> 10:36.701
Hey, don.
You guys give us a minute?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.407
Hey.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.943
Sorry to break up
the game.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.812
Marcello and fagan
were both ambushed.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.383
Just blasted in the face
with buckshot.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.119
- Yeah, i heard.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.656
You've gotta be just as
torn up as i am.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.394
I heard you picked up
that psycho, norelli.

11:02.396 --> 11:05.897
- Yeah,
but he ain't good for it.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.132
Don, i was hoping

11:07.134 --> 11:10.135
That you could lead me
in the right direction.

11:13.674 --> 11:18.843
- Did, uh, did you feel
the temperature drop

11:18.845 --> 11:22.213
When you walked in here?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.983
The word is out about you
working with internal affairs.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.117
- You want to pat me down?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.385
See if i'm wired up?

11:29.122 --> 11:32.190
- You're just asking
some funny questions, is all.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.799
Honestly?
I figured it was norelli.

11:40.801 --> 11:45.136
If i knew anything else,
you know i would tell you.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.338
- You know, nick and billy fagan

11:47.340 --> 11:51.042
Were shaking down
this dry cleaner hansen.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.379
- For what?
Extra starch?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.448
[chuckles]

11:59.086 --> 12:03.054
- You were always the one
who was running his mouth

12:03.056 --> 12:05.457
The most but had the least
to say.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.966
- This is a social club.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.372
Do not come to me
with police business again.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.977
Do you understand?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.351
- What happened?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.919
- She swallowed a bottle
of xanax

12:34.921 --> 12:37.055
Because i lost our business.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.424
Can we do this another time?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.226
- Some guys
from maxwell investments

12:41.228 --> 12:42.761
Pay you a visit?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.799
- Had one good cleaners
we built from scratch.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.137
Bank wouldn't give us a loan
for a second location,

12:52.139 --> 12:55.240
So i borrowed from maxwell's.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.775
Things didn't work out so good.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.042
Couldn't get out of the red

12:58.044 --> 13:00.078
And--and when i didn't
repay them fast enough,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.479
They took both our stores.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.515
- Yeah, and blowing them away
with a shotgun

13:03.517 --> 13:06.301
Would probably take care
of the vig.

13:06.302 --> 13:09.086
- Oh, am i torn up
that those leaches are dead?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.188
Not for a second.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.358
- Dad?
What's going on?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.527
- They're just here
to ask some question, hun.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.195
It's okay.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.563
- You guys want to step outside?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.131
- Let's go.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.237
- Is this about my mom?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.040
- Actually, i need to know
where your dad was all day.

13:29.042 --> 13:33.378
- With us, why?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.246
- Look, why don't you
take your brother home?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.148
You guys should get
some sleep, okay?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.017
- This is where i need to be.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.085
- Okay.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.091
- How are the kids?

13:47.093 --> 13:50.528
- Lost, man.
- It's always that way, huh?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.298
Parents do dumb things,
the kids take the brunt.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.966
[cell phone rings]
we got to run the dad.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.001
See if he bought a shotgun
recently.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.839
- Halstead.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.507
Thanks.
There's another shotgun victim

14:02.509 --> 14:04.242
In bridgeport.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.579
[chatter on police radio]

14:19.526 --> 14:22.026
- Yeah.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.295
George washington
strikes again.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.465
[pounding from trunk]

14:27.467 --> 14:29.367
- Did you check the car?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.236
- Uh...

14:31.238 --> 14:34.906
- Hey.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.975
- Open the trunk.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.085
Get out of there.
- Don't shoot!

14:50.390 --> 14:51.623
- It's all right.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.591
It's all right.
We're the police.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.094
- Call an ambulance.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.996
- It's okay.

15:09.142 --> 15:09.374
.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.277
- It's okay, take your time.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.079
- Me and dad
got out of the car.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.285
It's like he came
out of nowhere.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.354
Wearing a hoodie.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.422
- Did you get a look at him?

15:27.160 --> 15:30.528
- White.
Dark hair, clean shaven.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.966
And his eyes.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.336
There was nothing behind them.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.371
He just had this blank look.

15:42.509 --> 15:46.377
And...He just

15:46.379 --> 15:51.382
Turned the shotgun
on my dad, and...

15:51.384 --> 15:54.252
Right in front of me.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.455
- I'm sorry.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.658
- Who would do that?

16:00.660 --> 16:04.462
A human being
wouldn't do that.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.467
- Colette?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.303
Colette?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.405
- Yeah?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.007
- How did you end up
in the trunk?

16:18.378 --> 16:19.344
- He turned the gun on me.

16:21.081 --> 16:25.516
That same dead look
in his eyes.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.287
And i said,
please don't kill me.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.592
So, he nodded at the trunk
and said get in.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.883
- Yo.

16:41.884 --> 16:43.767
Shotgun shell was found
in the garage, 10-guage.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.236
We're looking
into the lot number

16:45.238 --> 16:46.304
To see where it was bought.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.372
- You run a check
on dale hansen?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.140
- Yeah, he hasn't bought
a shotgun.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.443
Legally.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.245
- Hey, ruzek?
- Yeah.

16:54.247 --> 16:58.383
- Colette saw the shooter,
so we're gonna need a sketch.

16:58.385 --> 17:02.286
- From the new composite
software that just came out?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.288
- Correct.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.522
- Yeah, all right, yeah.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.396
- I'm gonna be right over here
if you need me.

17:12.398 --> 17:16.099
- Take a seat right here.
Pop a squat.

17:16.102 --> 17:20.738
And we'll get this started.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.574
The eyes, are they more round
like this or more squinty

17:23.576 --> 17:24.675
Like this?

17:24.676 --> 17:28.179
- Um, i don't know, round?

17:28.181 --> 17:29.380
- Okay, round.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.424
- Do you know
what you're doing?

17:39.426 --> 17:40.558
- Absolutely, yeah.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.298
Colette, why don't you
come with me, okay?

17:50.703 --> 17:53.304
Come on.
You all right?

18:31.344 --> 18:34.412
[distant voices echoing]

18:45.658 --> 18:47.625
- Me, nick, and don
used to raise a lot of hell

18:47.627 --> 18:49.427
Back in the day.
- Heh!

18:49.429 --> 18:50.795
- I remember.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.530
Nick and i were planning
to take a trip

18:52.532 --> 18:54.465
Up to lake geneva
in a few weeks.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.400
- They still have that--
that bar up there?

18:56.402 --> 18:57.702
What's it called?

18:57.704 --> 19:00.471
- The mason lounge.
- [laughs]

19:00.473 --> 19:02.874
Some bad country music.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.809
- Those were some fun times.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.844
The four of us.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.781
I used to wonder how you coped
after camille died.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.384
- I just, uh...

19:16.222 --> 19:19.223
Just gotta give it time.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.495
Trish, what do you know
about maxwell investments?

19:26.332 --> 19:29.600
- I know it was a business
nick was involved in.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.469
That's it.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.870
- These other two guys
who were killed,

19:32.872 --> 19:36.307
Valeo and fagan,

19:36.309 --> 19:37.775
They ever come around here
at all?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.378
- Yeah.

19:40.380 --> 19:46.551
A little.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.920
Don enrietto.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.522
I saw him at the club
earlier, and i gotta be honest.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.791
I had a bad hit.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.627
Did nick have a falling out
with enrietto?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.897
- Hank, i can't talk
about enrietto?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.332
You know that.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.367
- Just--just nod your head.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.970
Was nick on the outs
with him?

20:05.972 --> 20:09.307
Did enrietto want him dead?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.542
- Heh.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.245
Kids'll be home soon.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.917
- Yeah. All right.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.996
- Haven't seen you in a while.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.602
- Yeah, i've had to change up
my routine a little bit.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.769
It's a long story.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.504
- You don't need a reason.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.441
You are welcome back here
anytime.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.312
- You look amazing.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.514
I mean, okay,
i'm gonna say it.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.551
You have my genes.
[laughs]

20:53.553 --> 20:57.822
But i really am,
i'm so proud of you, erin.

20:57.824 --> 21:02.426
- Thanks.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.296
- Well, some good news.

21:05.298 --> 21:08.466
I've been clean
for seven months.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.269
In fact, that's the real reason
i wanted to see you.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.672
I've done the ninth step
with everyone else but you.

21:14.674 --> 21:18.276
- Mom, you really--
- i am sorry.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.877
- Okay.
There, you said it.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.979
- Honey, please.
Let's be back

21:21.981 --> 21:23.681
In each other's lives again.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.683
- I've been down this road
with you so many times.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.618
- This is different, baby.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.786
- Really?

21:34.927 --> 21:38.296
- Is hank voight
still in your life?

21:38.298 --> 21:42.433
- Yeah, he's my boss.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.902
- You know, i'm so grateful
to him for everything

21:44.904 --> 21:47.738
He did for you when i couldn't.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.674
- Wouldn't.

21:49.676 --> 21:55.613
- Fine.
Whatever.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.416
But he's not your blood.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.817
I am.

22:11.631 --> 22:12.963
- Hey, where's white mike?

22:12.965 --> 22:15.032
Shouldn't he be three highballs
deep by now?

22:15.034 --> 22:17.735
- White mike got married.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.537
- White mike?

22:19.539 --> 22:20.905
- There's hope for all of us,
right?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.506
- And a beacon of your light

22:22.508 --> 22:23.774
Has shined down upon
white mike, lord.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.077
We toast thee.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.755
- I got--i gotta go.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.457
- Okay.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.801
- Figured since you're a cop,
i don't got to call 911.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.746
They skipped the good stuff.

23:03.850 --> 23:07.017
- Any other apartments
broken into?

23:07.019 --> 23:09.720
- Just yours.

23:17.764 --> 23:17.995
.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.864
- Anything?
- Getting there.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.532
- Yeah?

23:21.534 --> 23:23.534
- And you're gonna put a good
word in about me upstairs?

23:23.536 --> 23:24.969
- You're golden, all right?

23:24.971 --> 23:27.438
Now, this is you?
Turkey burger?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.190
There you go, kid.

23:29.191 --> 23:30.941
- Tell me the jawline
one more time.

23:30.943 --> 23:35.880
Narrow, angular,
round, square?

23:35.882 --> 23:38.549
- Narrow, i guess.

23:41.487 --> 23:44.555
- Hey, you sure you don't
want to go home?

23:44.557 --> 23:47.425
Take-take a rest real fast?

23:47.427 --> 23:51.829
- I want to find out
who killed my dad.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.799
- Okay.
Yeah.

23:54.801 --> 24:00.004
- If you need to sleep--
- no, no, hey.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.206
I am not going anywhere.

24:02.208 --> 24:07.578
But...I'd love
for you to eat, please?

24:15.588 --> 24:16.954
Something like that?

24:20.660 --> 24:21.992
- You're getting close.

24:28.701 --> 24:32.603
- Guys?

24:32.605 --> 24:35.139
This mean anything to you?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.547
- That's the kid
from the hospital.

24:43.549 --> 24:48.519
That's dale hansen's son.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.820
- Nate hansen was enrolled

24:49.822 --> 24:52.256
At the union hill
military academy in arizona.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.592
His tac officer
says he was first in his class

24:54.594 --> 24:56.660
But three days ago,
he disappeared.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.596
That was the day
after his mother overdosed.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.763
- I just checked
with the school's army.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.265
They're missing
a browning gold 10-gauge,

25:01.267 --> 25:02.566
Along with a box of shells.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.668
- Let's grab this kid up.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.668
- Chicago police!

25:37.670 --> 25:40.738
- My brother's not here.
- Get back, get back.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.723
- Eyewitness
described your son to a "t."

25:42.724 --> 25:44.707
- I think you got squeezed,
you wanted some retribution,

25:44.710 --> 25:46.677
So you sent your son
to do it for you.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.779
- I swear we just found out
what nate was doing.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.649
He ran off maybe
a half hour ago.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.683
- We're all clear, guys.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.984
No nate, no weapons.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.686
- If you had nothing
to do with it, how did nate

25:55.688 --> 26:00.658
Know who to target?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.694
- The three of them.
Marcello, fagan, and valeo

26:03.696 --> 26:06.330
Showed up one night.

26:06.332 --> 26:11.335
When i said i'd go to the cops,
they threatened my life.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.071
My kids.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.105
Nate saw them do this.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.342
He saw me cower and beg.

26:18.344 --> 26:22.112
The look on his face.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.814
It's my fault.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.784
- If you find nate,
please don't hurt him.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.353
- That's up to him.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.155
- Is there anyone else
who leaned on you,

26:31.157 --> 26:32.957
Your son might be gunning for?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.925
- Uh...

26:34.927 --> 26:38.195
There was a boss who i paid
money to a few times.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.631
Enrietto.

26:40.633 --> 26:41.966
- Don enrietto?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.778
- All right.
I know enrietto,

26:54.780 --> 26:58.716
I'll make the first play--
[gunshot]

26:58.718 --> 27:00.851
Cover the back!

27:03.889 --> 27:05.356
- Police!

27:35.421 --> 27:37.688
- Kid thought

27:37.690 --> 27:40.724
I'd go down easy.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.670
[shotgun cocks]

28:11.323 --> 28:11.755
.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.924
- Okay.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.432
Think about what you're doing.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.917
Offender fleeing
southbound on foot.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.485
Dark hoodie.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.289
Stop, police!

28:50.396 --> 28:52.463
[alarm blaring]

29:00.306 --> 29:01.772
- Jay!

29:12.885 --> 29:15.052
- Nate, stop!

29:49.421 --> 29:52.823
[train horn blowing]
- nate, stop!

30:10.876 --> 30:13.310
- When i was on patrol,
a guy got mugged.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.813
Chased a robber
into one of these.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.047
Took the body patrol
about three days

30:17.049 --> 30:18.549
To find all those parts.

30:18.551 --> 30:19.950
- How about you
tell that story

30:19.952 --> 30:22.452
When we we're not
walking on the tracks?

30:33.866 --> 30:35.265
- Check this out.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.379
- Got a ping on hansen's phone.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.380
It's right around here
somewhere.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.115
- Where?
- I don't know,

30:52.117 --> 30:53.383
This thing says right here.

30:53.385 --> 30:57.454
- Police!

30:57.456 --> 30:58.355
- What happened?
- A kid.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.556
He had a gun.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.859
- A white kid in a navy hoodie?
Okay.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.527
- Hey, he dumped his phone.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.528
- He took my car.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.530
- What kind of car?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.899
[siren]

31:08.901 --> 31:10.033
- It's not good enough.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.402
I want
every blue 2005 ford escort

31:12.404 --> 31:14.504
On any highway
coming out of chicago to--

31:14.506 --> 31:16.173
- Guys?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.375
White male with a shotgun
just stormed into chicago med.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.611
- That's where
hansen's mother is.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.514
- Stay back!

31:24.516 --> 31:28.051
- Nathan?
Please don't do this.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.620
- Let's go, get 'em out.

31:29.622 --> 31:32.222
Coming through,
coming through.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.966
- Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, put your guns down.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.601
Put them down.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.670
Put your guns down!

31:51.143 --> 31:54.444
- Stay back!

31:58.684 --> 32:01.285
- Nate.

32:05.491 --> 32:08.492
Listen to me, okay?

32:14.700 --> 32:17.467
I was in the army.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.504
Third battalion,
75th ranger regiment.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.440
My name is jay.

32:23.442 --> 32:27.444
And i know exactly what you're
feeling right now.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.247
- Please.
Listen to him.

32:32.584 --> 32:36.053
- You were trained to protect.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.323
And that's what you did.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.992
But it's over, okay?

32:41.994 --> 32:45.529
So i need you
to just put your gun down.

32:45.531 --> 32:49.700
And i promise you,
you're gonna walk out of here.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.237
You're 17.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.406
They can't charge you
as an adult, all right?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.508
You could still make a deal.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.446
- They won't shoot me?

33:02.448 --> 33:04.381
- Buddy,
they got to shoot me first.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.666
- Here, sir.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.242
- Okay, come on.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.545
All right.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.681
I need you to put your hands
behind your back.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.183
- [sobbing]

33:44.623 --> 33:45.722
.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.691
- My parents spent
their whole lives

33:47.693 --> 33:49.526
Building that business

33:49.528 --> 33:53.063
To provide for me
and lauren.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.700
They beat my dad
like a dog in front of me.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.202
- You should've just come
to the police, kid.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.371
- They told him
they'd kill us if they did.

34:01.373 --> 34:05.776
- Why'd you put the dollar bill
on their chest?

34:05.778 --> 34:09.612
- They want our money?

34:09.614 --> 34:11.782
They can have it.

34:11.784 --> 34:14.650
- He used to get
in so much trouble.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.753
He was always fighting
with mom and dad

34:16.755 --> 34:19.790
Until they sent him
to that school.

34:19.792 --> 34:25.161
And then that place made him
into this.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.396
- He's gonna be held
on no bail

34:26.398 --> 34:28.764
Until he's arraigned.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.268
- Nate said you won't
charge him as an adult.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.803
- It's premeditated murder.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.504
The state's attorney
will try to take a run at it.

34:34.505 --> 34:38.675
- So you liked to him?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.510
- To get the gun
out of his hand

34:40.512 --> 34:42.612
So he didn't kill
somebody else?

34:42.614 --> 34:47.384
Hell, yes, i did.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.753
- He still has his place
in elmwood park

34:49.755 --> 34:52.755
And remember that old broken
boat he had in his backyard?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.157
Still there.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.725
He still talks about
fixing it up

34:55.726 --> 34:57.794
And moving to channel lake,
god bless him.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.831
You used to love
spending the fourth there,

35:00.833 --> 35:04.668
Having roman candle fights
with the neighborhood kids.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.404
- I don't remember that.
- Hmm.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.706
- Do you know what i do remember
about the 4th of july?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.475
- What?

35:11.477 --> 35:15.779
- The time i found you od'd
on the kitchen floor.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.116
- Oh.
- I didn't think a 70 pound girl

35:19.118 --> 35:22.686
Could lift a grown woman
like that.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.721
But see, i knew i couldn't
call 911 for help 'cause

35:24.723 --> 35:27.791
Then cps would take me from you.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.829
Yeah, i dragged you
into the bathtub.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.300
Kept filling it
with ice cubes.

35:37.302 --> 35:41.771
Just sitting there hoping
you didn't die.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.774
- Do we really have to bring up
all this negative stuff?

35:44.776 --> 35:49.613
- I was nine.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.515
And do you know what you
said to me when you woke up?

35:54.353 --> 35:56.820
"get my cigarettes."

35:58.557 --> 36:00.657
- I made amends with you, erin.

36:03.695 --> 36:04.578
- Oh, i know you did.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.462
And i know you don't like
talking about it.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.366
But if you want to get back
in my life,

36:09.368 --> 36:12.369
Sometimes i'm gonna have to.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.470
Your call.

36:14.773 --> 36:19.776
[knock at window]

36:19.778 --> 36:22.312
- Can we just drop it, please?

36:22.314 --> 36:27.684
- Oh, i get it now.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.719
You meet a nice guy,

36:29.721 --> 36:32.589
And he finds out you have
an adult daughter in chicago

36:32.591 --> 36:34.324
That you haven't talked
to in eight years

36:34.326 --> 36:37.427
And thinks it's
a little weird, right?

36:37.429 --> 36:40.430
So, you want me to
prop you up?

36:40.432 --> 36:43.833
- Could we just drop this?
Really, please?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.402
Hi, honey.
- Sorry i'm late,

36:45.404 --> 36:47.904
Work was crazy.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.974
- Johnny, i want you to meet
my daughter, erin.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.547
- Nice to meet you, johnny.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.349
I got to run back to work,

36:59.351 --> 37:01.751
But i just wanted
to congratulate you guys.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.687
- It's great meeting
you too, erin.

37:03.689 --> 37:04.754
Hopefully we'll be
seeing you a lot more.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.489
- Yeah.
- Bye, sweetheart.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.997
- This nurse says to me,
that is against medical advice.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.632
I said, that's fine.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.435
Why don't you just shove
it right up your ass?

37:18.437 --> 37:20.503
[laughter]

37:25.844 --> 37:30.880
- Hey, hank?
Want to play some pinochle?

37:30.882 --> 37:34.851
- Nah, nah.
I just sent a teenager away

37:34.853 --> 37:37.454
For murder,
and i got a friend

37:37.456 --> 37:38.955
Laying in the morgue,
i'm just gonna sit here

37:38.957 --> 37:42.325
And drink this beer.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.738
- You know, i remember

37:54.740 --> 37:59.309
When you and me and nick

37:59.311 --> 38:04.547
Were little kids
running around this club.

38:04.549 --> 38:10.787
Washing the old-timers' cars.
Going out for beer runs.

38:10.789 --> 38:16.359
And when you said
that you were gonna be a cop,

38:16.361 --> 38:18.928
I said, of course you are.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.332
Your old man was one.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.768
That's your lot in life.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.604
And i said to nick,

38:27.606 --> 38:32.409
"you know, why don't you
go with hank?

38:32.411 --> 38:35.679
"go be a cop.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.981
"have a steady life

38:37.983 --> 38:41.985
"because you are not cut out
for the other side

38:41.987 --> 38:46.356
Of the street."

38:46.358 --> 38:49.492
You know what he said?

38:49.494 --> 38:52.562
"no way.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.963
I want to hang with you,
donnie."

38:58.070 --> 39:01.037
I miss him, too.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.605
But he knew the risks.

39:10.615 --> 39:11.815
- This is a social club.

39:15.787 --> 39:20.357
You don't come to me
talking about nick

39:20.359 --> 39:24.494
Ever again.

39:24.496 --> 39:27.030
You understand?

39:51.156 --> 39:57.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.962
- Went well, huh?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.630
- Mm-hmm.

40:00.632 --> 40:04.868
Can i have another one?
- You got it.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.069
- You're sleeping with her.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.906
- What?
No.

40:09.908 --> 40:13.009
- You're a horrible liar.

40:13.011 --> 40:17.480
- We played scrabble, like,
once at her apartment.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.648
- Shut up.
- That's it.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.151
- Shut up.

40:21.153 --> 40:24.521
Thank you.
She's cute.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.659
What's up?

40:29.661 --> 40:34.831
- I need a place to crash
until the bounty blows over.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.599
- I think you're in luck.
Walinski's got room

40:36.601 --> 40:38.435
In his garage.
- Come on.

40:38.437 --> 40:43.773
- Come on, what?
- Can i crash with you?

40:43.775 --> 40:48.645
- Are you gonna try
to play scrabble with me, too?

40:48.647 --> 40:51.748
- I will be
the perfect gentleman, as usual.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.483
- Don't even start.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.853
- Can i or not?

40:56.855 --> 41:00.957
- Yeah,
we'll work something out.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.025
Jay!

41:02.027 --> 41:07.997
[people screaming]

41:07.999 --> 41:10.233
- Maddie!
