01:39.140 --> 01:42.810
<i>She's, um...</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:46.063
<i>Well, she's...</i>

01:46.064 --> 01:49.566
something a little strange.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.527
That's what you notice,

01:51.653 --> 01:55.072
that she's not a woman
like all the others.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.993
She seems all wrapped up in herself.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.830
Lost...

02:02.956 --> 02:08.001
in a world she carries
deep inside her...

02:08.086 --> 02:13.799
but surrounded by a world of luxury.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.469
A sumptuous boudoir.

02:17.595 --> 02:22.015
Her bed all quilted satin.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.102
Chiffon drapes.

02:26.354 --> 02:31.108
From her window,
you can see the Eiffel Tower.

02:32.694 --> 02:37.322
Suddenly, her maid brings in
a gift-wrapped box.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.409
A token from an admirer.

02:40.535 --> 02:45.664
She's a cabaret star of the highest rank.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.292
She opens the box.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.794
It's a diamond bracelet.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.672
But she sends it back.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.426
Men are really at her feet.
She's known a few.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.137
But not the one

03:00.138 --> 03:03.765
she's been waiting for all her life.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.809
A real man.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.897
Her maid has prepared her a foam bath.

03:10.023 --> 03:15.027
The star takes a towel
and wraps it around her hair

03:15.153 --> 03:18.030
like a turban.

03:18.156 --> 03:22.075
Her fingernails painted a rosy peach,

03:22.160 --> 03:26.163
she unfastens her taffeta nightgown

03:26.164 --> 03:29.791
and lets it slide smoothly
down her thighs

03:29.918 --> 03:32.377
to the tile floor.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.713
Her skin glistens.

03:34.839 --> 03:40.177
Her petite ankle slips
into the perfumed water.

03:40.303 --> 03:45.349
Then her sensuous legs,
until finally her whole body

03:45.475 --> 03:48.685
is caressed with foam.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.854
I told you.
No erotic descriptions.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.774
Whatever, but she's a ravishing woman.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.192
Do you know what I mean?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.194
I mean...

03:57.195 --> 04:02.407
the most ravishing woman in the world.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.201
Yeah, sure.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.369
She really is.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.537
Perfect figure.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.998
Classical features.

04:10.124 --> 04:14.795
But with these big green...

04:14.921 --> 04:17.214
<i>eyes.</i>

04:18.632 --> 04:20.050
They're black.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.802
I'm the one who saw the movie,

04:21.928 --> 04:24.221
but if that's what you want,
big black eyes.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.139
Kind eyes.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.268
<i>Tender eyes.</i>

04:29.394 --> 04:33.230
<i>But beware.
They can see...</i>

04:33.314 --> 04:34.815
<i>everything.</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:38.277
<i>There's nothing you can hide from them.</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:46.243
No matter how lonely she may be,

04:46.244 --> 04:50.580
she keeps men... at a distance.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.208
She's probably got bad breath 
or something.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.046
If you're going to crack jokes
about a film

04:58.172 --> 05:00.465
that I happen to be fond of,
there's no reason to go on.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.552
All right, all right, go ahead.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.181
Suddenly...

05:08.266 --> 05:10.934
we're in Paris.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.355
Troops are marching

05:15.481 --> 05:18.984
right underneath the Arc de Triomphe.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.197
Really handsome soldiers,

05:24.282 --> 05:26.575
and...

05:26.701 --> 05:31.288
the French girls are applauding
as they pass by.

05:31.289 --> 05:36.126
Then we are on this typical
Parisian back street.

05:36.252 --> 05:40.088
Dead end, sort of --
sort of looking up a hill,

05:40.214 --> 05:45.177
<i>and these really weird-looking Frenchmen --</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:47.846
<i>not the typical ones with the berets --</i>

05:47.972 --> 05:51.308
<i>are unloading a truck --
It's wartime of course --</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:55.896
<i>and the boxes contain contraband delicacies 
like canned meat,</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:59.316
<i>the best cheeses...</i>

05:59.317 --> 06:02.235
mm, peaches in syrup...

06:02.320 --> 06:03.612
Don't talk about food.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.698
Not to mention the hams and the patÃ©s.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.784
I'm serious.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.328
No food and no naked women.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.834
You still feeling dizzy?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.088
It's my back.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.173
You've been bleeding again.
Look at your shirt.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.174
It's all wet.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.344
It's just sweat.
I had another fever break.

06:30.348 --> 06:35.769
Well, what do you think so far?
Isn't it fabulous?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.354
Helps pass the time.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.523
Does that mean that you like it?

06:39.649 --> 06:43.026
Doesn't help any great cause,
but I guess it's all right.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.362
Blessed Mary, is that all
you can talk about?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.948
You must have studied 
political philosophies in school.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.991
The phrase is "political science",

06:50.118 --> 06:52.369
and the answer is no.
I studied journalism.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.371
Oh, so you can appreciate a good story.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.289
And easily spot a cheap one.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.333
I know it's nothing terribly intellectual

06:58.418 --> 06:59.793
like you must be used to.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.337
It's just a... romance,

07:02.422 --> 07:05.048
but it's so beautiful.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.386
Now...

07:09.512 --> 07:11.388
suddenly...

07:11.472 --> 07:16.309
this military convoy rushes forward!

07:19.647 --> 07:21.982
<i>Marvelous German soldiers</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:25.152
<i>catch those weird smugglers in the act</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:27.195
<i>and arrest them all.</i>

07:34.787 --> 07:39.833
But watching nearby...

07:39.959 --> 07:43.795
is this small truck.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.507
With these two French thugs
from the Resistance...

07:47.633 --> 07:50.177
who are spying on the Germans.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.680
<i>This hulking clubfoot
and his half-deaf flunky.</i>

07:53.806 --> 07:55.223
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

07:55.349 --> 07:57.517
Those weird guys the Germans arrested?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.436
Yes.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.398
What do you mean
they didn't look French?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.984
They didn't look French.
They looked...

08:06.110 --> 08:09.362
um... Turkish.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.114
I'm not sure, but they had these,

08:11.240 --> 08:12.782
like, these caps on their heads,

08:12.909 --> 08:14.659
like these -- like these, um...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.457
Turkish. Fezzes.

08:20.583 --> 08:25.921
Those caps are yarmulkes.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.007
Can't you see this is
a fucking anti-Semitic film?

08:29.133 --> 08:32.469
Oh, come on!

08:32.595 --> 08:34.471
Wait.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.389
This must have been a German movie, right?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.142
I don't know.
It was from years ago.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.186
Look.

08:41.312 --> 08:45.482
I don't explain my movies.
It just ruins the emotion.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.484
This must have been
a Nazi propaganda film

08:47.485 --> 08:48.443
done during the war.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.239
I don't know.
That's just the background.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.993
This is where the important part begins,

08:57.119 --> 09:00.247
the part about the lovers.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.499
<i>It's divine.</i>

09:05.586 --> 09:10.507
<i>Every night, the chic set flocks 
to this exclusive club,</i>

09:10.508 --> 09:15.220
<i>with lovers at every table,
spies in every corner,</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:20.517
<i>and the top officers
of the German high command.</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:23.520
<i>One of them is Werner.</i>

09:23.604 --> 09:26.439
<i>Werner -- so distant, so divine --</i>

09:26.524 --> 09:28.233
<i>and the chief of counterintelligence</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:29.526
<i>for all France.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:33.863
<i>Oh, and Michelle, 
with her angel face,</i>

09:33.990 --> 09:37.117
<i>the cigarette girl 
who really is working for, the --</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:38.368
<i>Well, you'll see.</i>

09:38.494 --> 09:41.371
<i>And then...</i>

09:41.497 --> 09:44.874
<i>The moment they're all waiting for...</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:47.919
<i>Da da!</i> 

09:48.045 --> 09:52.549
Stepping into the spotlight
is that legendary star,

09:52.675 --> 09:55.427
that ravishing chanteuse,

09:55.553 --> 09:58.221
Leni...

09:58.347 --> 09:59.556
Lamaison.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.371
Yes?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.915
<i>Yakov and Naveed were arrested.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:08.541
Did you get the map?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.627
No. There was no time.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.004
Just get it.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.632
Nothing else matters.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.634
Vive la France!

12:04.098 --> 12:10.019
<i>Werner's eyes begin to burn into her soul.</i>

12:10.146 --> 12:12.272
<i>Eyes like the claws of an eagle.</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:14.524
<i>Inescapable.</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:29.289
What are you laughing at?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.668
Well, it must be something.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.757
At you.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.095
And me.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.706
What's going on?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.125
Quiet!

13:14.251 --> 13:15.835
They're bringing someone new.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.676
What time is it anyway?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.513
He's really bleeding.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.641
Is it a political prisoner?

13:32.394 --> 13:37.190
They don't treat you like that
for stealing bananas.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.527
Mm. You know him?

14:17.231 --> 14:20.108
Come on. Go.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.948
Your name?
Hey! You!

14:27.074 --> 14:28.825
And your name?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.501
Luis Molina.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.336
Valentin Arregui.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.859
Do you want to shave?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.283
Well, I didn't mean your legs.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.500
What is the matter?

15:19.627 --> 15:23.796
I don't understand why they stopped 
my interrogation.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.887
It's been almost a week.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.890
Why couldn't they give me

15:34.016 --> 15:36.893
that handsome leading blond man here

15:36.894 --> 15:40.521
to keep me company, instead of you?

15:40.648 --> 15:42.857
What the hell are you talking about?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.234
Are you afraid to talk about sex?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.780
You really want to know, Molina?

15:48.906 --> 15:50.406
I find you boring.

15:50.532 --> 15:54.410
Darling, you don't know page one.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.997
You know I'm a faggot.
Well, congratulations.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.916
You know I corrupted a minor.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.920
Well, that's even on TV,
film at 11:00.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.547
You really like those Nazi blonds, 
don't you?

16:06.674 --> 16:10.551
Well, no, you see,
I detest politics,

16:10.678 --> 16:13.096
but I'm mad about the leading man.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.848
He's so romantic.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.226
Should I be shot for that?

16:18.352 --> 16:19.936
Your Nazis are about as romantic

16:20.062 --> 16:22.438
as the fucking warden
and his torture room.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.940
I can imagine.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.193
No.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.028
You can't.

17:10.904 --> 17:11.988
You can't sleep?

17:14.157 --> 17:15.992
You mind if I tell my picture?

17:18.996 --> 17:21.998
After the show...

17:21.999 --> 17:25.834
Leni changes into a satin evening gown

17:25.960 --> 17:27.002
that makes her look heavenly.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.213
Firm breasts...

17:29.339 --> 17:31.716
thin waist...

17:31.842 --> 17:33.009
smooth hips...

17:33.010 --> 17:35.011
Is this propaganda or porno?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.722
<i>Just listen.
You'll see.</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:39.015
Excuse me.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.642
Leni.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.688
What is it, Michelle?

17:48.525 --> 17:50.943
Leni...

17:51.028 --> 17:54.322
I'm a traitor.
A traitor to France.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.199
What do you mean?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.493
I'm going to have a baby.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.078
But the father,

18:00.204 --> 18:04.040
he's a young lieutenant
of the occupation army.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.918
Is that so?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.961
My poor Michelle.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.423
But he loves me
and wants to get married --

18:12.549 --> 18:15.051
as soon as he can get permission.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.348
I really can't understand.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.558
How could you fall in love

18:22.684 --> 18:27.021
with an enemy of our France?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.107
Love has no country, Leni.

18:31.485 --> 18:35.071
But there's something else
you don't know.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.031
Leni, dear...

18:37.116 --> 18:38.741
I'm working for the resist--

18:40.369 --> 18:43.621
Come in!

18:50.337 --> 18:51.838
For you, madame.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.091
How can you remember all this crap?

18:55.092 --> 18:56.467
You must be making it up.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.470
No! I'm not, I sw--

18:59.596 --> 19:02.140
Well, I embroider a little

19:02.266 --> 19:04.475
so that you can see it the way I do.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.102
God help me.

19:06.103 --> 19:10.481
You atheists never stop talking about God.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.942
And you gays never face facts.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.652
Fantasies are no escape.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.028
Whew.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.868
If you've got the keys to that door,

19:21.994 --> 19:25.580
I will gladly follow.

19:25.706 --> 19:30.001
Otherwise, I will escape in my own way.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.294
Thank you.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.505
Then your life is as trivial
as your movies.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.885
I'm going to sleep.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.265
Tell the truth.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.768
Who do you identify with the most?

19:47.895 --> 19:52.732
The clubfoot patriot
or the handsome Werner?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.360
Who do you identify with?

19:58.363 --> 20:02.325
Oh, the singer.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.160
Mmm.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.078
She's the star.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.831
I'm always...

20:08.957 --> 20:11.167
the heroine.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.864
Have some.
It's delicious.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.199
No, thanks.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.825
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

20:44.952 --> 20:48.120
Sure, I like it, but, no, thanks.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.040
Well, then go ahead and have some.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.750
It's a long time till lunch.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.210
Can't afford to get spoiled.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.212
Do you really think
that eating this avocado

20:56.213 --> 20:57.880
will make you spoiled and weak?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.465
Enjoy what life offers you.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.220
What life offers me is the struggle.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.013
When you're dedicated to that,

21:06.139 --> 21:07.598
pleasure becomes secondary.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.308
Does your girlfriend
think the same thing?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.726
How do you know I have a girl?

21:10.852 --> 21:14.563
It's... the normal thing.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.859
Does she avoid pleasure, too?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.653
She knows what really counts.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.405
That the most important thing

21:22.531 --> 21:24.448
is serving a cause that is noble.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.950
What kind of cause is that,

21:26.076 --> 21:27.702
one that doesn't let you eat an avocado?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.245
Molina, you would never understand.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.663
Well, I understand one thing.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.248
I offer you half of my precious avocado

21:32.374 --> 21:33.791
and you throw it back in my face.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.419
Don't act like that!
You sound just like a --

21:36.545 --> 21:39.213
Like a what?
Say it.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.842
Say it.
Like a woman, you mean.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.845
What's wrong with being like a woman?

21:45.971 --> 21:49.015
Why do only women get to be sensitive?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.601
Why not a man?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.937
A dog?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.857
Or a faggot?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.650
If more men acted like women,

21:59.776 --> 22:02.236
there wouldn't be so much violence like that.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.531
- Maybe you have a point.
- Oh!

22:05.657 --> 22:07.283
A flimsy one, but still a point.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.369
Oh, nice!
"Maybe I have a point."

22:18.003 --> 22:21.297
Molina, today's your lucky day.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.841
The warden want to talk to you.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.318
Why did the warden want to see you?

22:46.156 --> 22:49.158
My lawyer called.

22:49.284 --> 22:52.328
Parole seems out of the question.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.332
For a while, at least.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.460
How did he treat you, the warden?

22:59.586 --> 23:02.922
Like a faggot.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.340
Same as always.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.342
Oh, no.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.927
Shit!

23:14.893 --> 23:16.352
He told me something else.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.359
My mother's not doing too well.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.781
She has high blood pressure.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.702
And her heart is kind of weak.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.915
People can go on forever like that.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.292
Sure, but not if you upset them.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.671
Can you imagine the shame
of having a son in prison?

23:43.797 --> 23:45.840
And the reason?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.552
Go to sleep.
You'll feel better.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.388
No.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.391
Only one thing can help.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.104
Sure, man, go ahead.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.356
"Man"?

24:02.441 --> 24:05.401
Is there a man here?
Don't let him go!

24:05.402 --> 24:07.403
Did he get away?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.534
Okay. Cut the crap and tell your movie.

24:13.660 --> 24:17.329
And now...

24:17.414 --> 24:22.793
waiting in the moonlight,
behind the cabaret...

24:22.919 --> 24:25.254
is Werner's limousine.

24:25.380 --> 24:30.301
<i>Werner's eyes are locked
on the backstage exit.</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:34.346
<i>"La sortie des artistes."</i>

24:34.431 --> 24:37.975
<i>He signals his chauffeur
to open the door for her.</i>

24:38.101 --> 24:43.397
<i>Maybe because Leni sees a chance
to help Michelle,</i>

24:43.482 --> 24:46.317
<i>or maybe because Leni wants to know</i>

24:46.443 --> 24:50.863
<i>what kind of man is hidden
inside this enemy invader,</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:53.449
<i>she decides...</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:56.452
<i>to join him for the evening.</i>

25:04.628 --> 25:06.337
Madame.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.482
To a great artiste.

25:30.737 --> 25:35.866
<i>Michelle hurries
to meet her secret love.</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:39.745
<i>But dark forces have already
decided the fate</i>

25:39.871 --> 25:41.497
<i>of this sweet girl,</i>

25:41.498 --> 25:43.707
<i>this girl from the French Resistance</i>

25:43.833 --> 25:47.503
<i>in love with a German lieutenant.</i>

25:47.504 --> 25:51.340
Her time is up.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.508
What?

25:52.592 --> 25:55.511
<i>Because...</i>

25:55.512 --> 25:57.429
Hanson!

25:57.514 --> 26:00.724
<i>love is a luxury</i>

26:00.850 --> 26:04.395
<i>a spy cannot afford.</i>

26:10.986 --> 26:13.070
Michelle, look out!

26:29.546 --> 26:32.464
How can you leave me
sitting there like that,

26:32.549 --> 26:35.467
chattering to myself
like some silly parrot?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.261
Strange.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.807
When Michelle was killed,

26:41.933 --> 26:45.019
I...

26:45.145 --> 26:47.062
It was chilling.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.564
It's just a movie, Valentin,

26:48.648 --> 26:50.482
just one of mother's many stories.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.569
Yeah, but I keep thinking about...

26:53.653 --> 26:55.446
someone I know.

26:57.073 --> 27:00.075
Your girlfriend.
Tell me about her!

27:00.201 --> 27:02.578
My lips are sealed.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.500
It's just that I'm...

27:08.585 --> 27:13.088
so helpless in here,
with no way to protect her.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.382
So you have a heart after all.

27:15.508 --> 27:18.010
Mm.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.763
Write to her, 
tell her to stop taking chances.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.930
If you think like that,

27:22.057 --> 27:23.849
you'll never change anything
in this world.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.646
Now look who's living in a fantasy.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.610
You call this fantasy?

27:38.823 --> 27:41.116
I'm so sorry.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.286
Someday the struggle will be won.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.918
Don't worry, Valentin.
You'll have your day.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.547
I'm sure.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.928
Great.
I'm starving.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.686
Here.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.855
No. You take this one.
It has twice as much.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.189
Sure.
Because those bastards

28:54.315 --> 28:55.899
want us to fight over it.
Take it.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.401
No, you need it more than I do.

28:57.527 --> 28:58.819
Please. Please.
To build your strength.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.237
Don't argue.
Take it!

29:02.741 --> 29:04.366
May I have a spoon?

29:07.704 --> 29:09.163
Thanks.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.891
What's the matter?
Afraid of getting fat?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.727
No. 

29:34.397 --> 29:36.815
This glue is not so bad today.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.693
No.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.823
Valentin?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.910
When I said you should write
your girlfriend,

29:48.036 --> 29:51.413
I also meant you should tell her
that you love her.

29:51.539 --> 29:54.500
It's so nice to get a letter
from someone that you love.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.543
Are you crazy?

29:56.669 --> 29:59.254
A letter would be like
denouncing her to them.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.507
The only reason I'm still alive

30:01.633 --> 30:03.759
is because they want
some information from me.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.136
And if anyone tries to save me,

30:06.262 --> 30:09.556
they'd hide my arrest
by killing me on the spot.

30:09.682 --> 30:13.310
Valentin, please.
Just don't say things like that.

30:13.436 --> 30:16.688
The same thing could be happening 
to her right now.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.106
You love her very much, don't you?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.566
Love should always come first.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.610
That's great.
Now I'd like to eat in peace!

30:21.736 --> 30:25.531
Don't worry.
I won't disturb you.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.205
Oh.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.797
What is it now?

30:41.798 --> 30:44.174
It's my mother.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.801
She must really be in bad shape,

30:45.802 --> 30:47.427
or she'd come visit me with groceries.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.471
This happened once before.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.973
Sorry to hear that.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.558
Well, I told you she was sick,

30:52.684 --> 30:54.768
but of course you weren't paying
any attention.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.189
But that's not what I'm crying about.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.817
So what is it, for Christ's sake?

31:01.943 --> 31:04.820
Because it's so beautiful...

31:04.946 --> 31:09.366
when lovers are together
for a lifetime.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.536
Why is it so impossible?

31:12.662 --> 31:16.123
You got to be crazy crying
about something like that.

31:16.249 --> 31:21.753
I will cry about whatever I want to.

31:21.838 --> 31:27.426
Valentin, do you think 
you're the only one who's suffered?

31:27.552 --> 31:32.848
You think it's easy to find a real man?

31:32.849 --> 31:36.852
One who's humble
and yet has dignity.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.812
How many years
have I been searching?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.648
How many nights?

31:41.774 --> 31:45.861
How many faces filled 
with scorn and deceit?

31:46.862 --> 31:48.947
<i>I mean, you know,</i> 

31:49.073 --> 31:51.867
<i>working as a window dresser --</i>

31:51.868 --> 31:54.870
<i>enjoyable as it is --</i>

31:54.871 --> 31:56.872
<i>sometimes, at the end of the day,</i>

31:56.873 --> 31:58.874
<i>you wonder what it's all about.</i>

31:58.875 --> 32:03.587
<i>You feel kind of... empty inside.</i>

32:03.713 --> 32:05.339
<i>Then one night...</i>

32:05.465 --> 32:06.673
What? 

32:06.799 --> 32:09.092
It's something new
she just invented herself,

32:09.218 --> 32:11.345
which she calls it La Chikka-Chakka.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.639
And she goes, "Chikka-chakka,
chikka-chakka."

32:13.765 --> 32:15.223
And it's an overnight sensation!

32:15.350 --> 32:17.100
Next day she's in all newspaper,

32:17.226 --> 32:18.894
and her husband becomes so jealous

32:18.978 --> 32:20.896
because he thinks she's nuts.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.981
Good evening, gentlemen.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.900
Would you care for the daily special,

32:24.984 --> 32:26.902
or would you like to order <i>a la carte</i> ?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.905
I haven't decided yet.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.823
Okay. Right.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.660
<i>My heart was pounding,</i>

32:34.786 --> 32:40.207
<i>so afraid that I would be hurt
once again.</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:42.960
Are you ready for me, sir?

32:43.086 --> 32:46.296
Um... what do you suggest?

32:46.422 --> 32:48.924
Well, perhaps the lasagna and antipasto.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.844
Don't you think the lasagna
might be fattening?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.097
Then perhaps the steak and onion soup.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.350
That sounds wonderful.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.351
Right.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.727
- Thank you.
- Okay.

33:00.853 --> 33:03.855
<i>His white tunic, the way he moved,</i>

33:03.940 --> 33:06.733
<i>his sad smile.</i>

33:06.859 --> 33:12.572
<i>Everything seemed so perfect,
like in the movies.</i>

33:12.699 --> 33:16.034
<i>You have no idea how much trouble 
I went through,</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:18.954
<i>month after month, just to get him 
to go for a walk.</i>

33:20.373 --> 33:24.710
<i>But little by little, 
I made him see that I respected him.</i>

33:28.673 --> 33:31.383
Anyway, after more than a year,
we finally became friends.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.260
Jesus, did it take you another year

33:33.386 --> 33:34.761
to get him in the sack?

33:34.887 --> 33:37.264
Are you out of your mind?

33:37.390 --> 33:39.808
Nothing at all happened, ever.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.351
You got to be kidding.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.937
Don't you know anything at all?
He's straight. He's married.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.523
I said to him, 
"Just once. Let's do it just once",

33:46.649 --> 33:48.942
but, uh, he never wanted to.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.986
I don't believe this.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.947
Here I am staying up all night
thinking about your boyfriend.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.575
Sounds like a real bind, Molina.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.536
All you can do is take it like a man.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.915
I take it...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.209
like a woman.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.335
Always.

34:08.463 --> 34:13.007
That's why I want a husband
who's the boss.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.842
Did you ever meet his wife?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.387
No.

34:17.513 --> 34:20.014
But when they were on the verge
of splitting up,

34:20.016 --> 34:22.059
God, such illusions I had.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.311
Like what?

34:24.437 --> 34:27.147
That he might come home
and live with me.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.775
With my mother and me.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.527
And I would take care of him...

34:33.654 --> 34:37.949
<i>and help him lose 
that sadness of his forever.</i> 

34:38.034 --> 34:39.951
Well, that's life, Molina.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.119
No, it's a shame.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.704
With your looks and charm,

34:42.830 --> 34:44.956
you should work in a chic restaurant

34:45.041 --> 34:47.333
or in a big luxury hotel,

34:47.460 --> 34:49.835
making three times
what you're getting now

34:49.962 --> 34:51.588
in that stinkhole.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.049
That's not so easy.

34:54.132 --> 34:59.179
I know someone who works
in a big hotel on the coast.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.182
He could talk to the manager,

35:02.308 --> 35:04.893
and -- presto -- a new life.

35:05.019 --> 35:09.064
And be what,
a busboy in a snob joint?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.732
I would make less money than now.

35:10.858 --> 35:14.069
I could help you with a loan.

35:14.153 --> 35:18.073
With your poise,
you'd be a waiter in six months.

35:19.408 --> 35:22.077
I don't know.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.537
Of course you do.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.748
In a year,
a maitre d' in a tuxedo. 

35:26.874 --> 35:29.751
You could pay me back in no time.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.253
Maybe.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.089
Anyway, I appreciate your offer.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.173
I'll think about it.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.679
I got to get my bus.
I'm gonna be late.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.097
See you tomorrow.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.516
Bye-bye, Molina.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.476
Good night, Gabriel.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.440
Kiss the children for me.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.710
<i>And then it's over -- again.</i>

36:11.836 --> 36:16.131
<i>My dreams disappear...</i>

36:16.132 --> 36:18.967
<i>into the darkness...</i>

36:21.012 --> 36:25.140
<i>and I wake up alone...</i>

36:25.224 --> 36:28.143
waiting, as always,

36:28.269 --> 36:31.229
waiting and waiting
and waiting and waiting.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.065
Waiting for what?

36:34.150 --> 36:36.151
A man...

36:36.152 --> 36:39.154
Ha ha.
A real man.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.907
But that can't happen
because a real man,

36:42.033 --> 36:45.160
what he wants is a real woman.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.289
Can I ask you a question?

36:51.250 --> 36:54.085
What is a real man in your terms?

36:54.170 --> 36:57.297
Well...

36:57.423 --> 37:01.676
to be marvelous-looking and strong,

37:01.802 --> 37:03.553
without making any fuss about it,

37:03.679 --> 37:05.305
and walking very tall
like my waiter.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.432
He just gives you that impression,

37:07.558 --> 37:09.684
but inside it's another story.

37:09.810 --> 37:13.480
In this society,
without power behind you,

37:13.606 --> 37:15.148
no one walks tall.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.775
Don't be jealous.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.193
Don't be stupid.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.946
You see how you react?

37:21.072 --> 37:24.366
There's just no talking 
about a guy with another guy,

37:24.492 --> 37:26.493
without getting into a fuss.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.955
Look, just keep it
at a certain level, okay?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.206
Or let's not talk at all.

37:31.207 --> 37:35.543
Okay, you tell me what a real man is.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.879
I don't know.

37:38.005 --> 37:41.883
Sure, you do.
Go ahead, tell me.

37:42.009 --> 37:45.804
Well, not taking any crap from anybody,

37:45.930 --> 37:47.222
not even the powers that be.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.224
That's not the most important thing.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.433
What really makes a man

37:50.559 --> 37:52.560
has to do with not humiliating anybody.

37:52.687 --> 37:58.108
It's not letting the people around you 
feel degraded.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.235
That sounds like a saint.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.196
Forget it.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.618
Ohh!

38:08.744 --> 38:09.953
What's wrong?

38:10.079 --> 38:12.247
- My stomach.
- Maybe it's your appendix.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.291
No, I had mine out.
God, it hurts.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.001
You feel like throwing up?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.044
No, it's below there.
It's in my guts.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.965
The food didn't do anything to me.

38:22.091 --> 38:25.343
I don't know.
Maybe it's my ulcer.

38:25.469 --> 38:29.139
I don't like this.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.724
Why don't you go on with your movie?

38:30.850 --> 38:33.268
God! I never felt a pain like this.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.894
Go ahead and tell it.

38:35.021 --> 38:40.275
<i>Leni...lingers at the window, 
so sad, so alone,</i>

38:40.276 --> 38:44.612
<i>so afraid that she will fall in love...</i>

38:46.324 --> 38:50.076
Tonight, the invaders murdered
your friend Michelle.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.411
No!

38:51.537 --> 38:56.541
You must complete her mission
and find the secret map

38:56.667 --> 38:58.293
to the German arsenal.

39:00.129 --> 39:04.132
Their chief of counterintelligence

39:04.258 --> 39:05.967
is in love with you.

39:06.093 --> 39:09.012
I could never get involved
in such a thing.

39:10.389 --> 39:14.517
Nonsense.
Nothing could be safer.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.311
Do you love France?

39:16.395 --> 39:18.855
Of course I do.

39:18.981 --> 39:23.109
That Kraut can't keep his hands off you.

39:23.235 --> 39:28.323
Next time he touch you like this...

39:28.324 --> 39:32.327
and like this,
think of your country

39:32.453 --> 39:36.164
and get the map.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.333
Ah.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.669
Aah! Ohh!

39:41.796 --> 39:44.339
Stop her, you idiot!

39:50.346 --> 39:54.182
<i>Leni, desperate,</i>

39:54.308 --> 39:56.059
<i>runs along this dark, empty street,</i>

39:56.185 --> 39:58.353
<i>but, furious, 
Clubfoot hobbles after her.</i>

40:00.356 --> 40:04.359
Taxi!

40:04.443 --> 40:06.111
<i>When suddenly...</i>

40:06.237 --> 40:08.947
This girl is finished.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.241
What girl?

40:11.367 --> 40:14.369
Me, stupid!

40:14.453 --> 40:15.912
Molina!

40:17.623 --> 40:20.750
Guard! Guard!

40:22.378 --> 40:24.003
Guard!

40:46.402 --> 40:49.404
You're strong enough
to go back to your cell.

40:49.405 --> 40:52.407
Your diarrhea will stop tomorrow.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.993
Till then, no food.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.413
Only water. Clean water.

40:58.414 --> 40:59.789
If you can find it.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.333
Doctor, I need to see the warden 
right away.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.420
That's what they all say.

41:21.604 --> 41:25.064
I don't understand how you can 
pass out from an ulcer.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.443
I'm no spring chicken, darling.

41:28.444 --> 41:32.447
I'm getting dizzy even looking
at these pictures.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.620
God, wouldn't it be wonderful

41:38.746 --> 41:40.580
if you told me a movie for a change?

41:40.706 --> 41:44.000
One that I haven't seen.

41:44.126 --> 41:47.045
I don't remember any.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.464
Don't be like that.

41:50.049 --> 41:53.384
Come on, tell me one.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.386
Please?

41:55.471 --> 41:57.597
Don't be such a crybaby.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.768
Valentin, have you ever loved someone

42:01.894 --> 42:03.478
that you didn't want to love?

42:03.562 --> 42:06.481
What do you mean?

42:08.692 --> 42:12.237
Leni didn't want to fall in love
with Werner,

42:12.363 --> 42:15.740
but what could she do?

42:15.866 --> 42:19.452
She steps through his doorway

42:19.537 --> 42:22.580
like a goddess.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.500
<i>Her slim, graceful figure</i>

42:25.501 --> 42:27.502
trembles at the sight of Werner

42:27.586 --> 42:29.754
descending the marble staircase.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.381
Their eyes meet.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.507
Leni says...

42:32.633 --> 42:35.468
My best friend has been killed.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.637
I need a place to stay.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.072
Prepare the guest room.

42:59.285 --> 43:02.328
This music is magical.

43:02.454 --> 43:05.164
I feel like...

43:05.291 --> 43:07.875
I'm floating on air.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.255
<i>But her heart is saying,</i>

43:12.381 --> 43:15.466
<i>"Oh, Werner, you seem like a god,</i>

43:15.551 --> 43:17.468
<i>but your tears...</i>

43:17.553 --> 43:21.055
your tears are proof that you have 
the feelings of a man."

43:21.181 --> 43:22.265
Quiet!

43:23.851 --> 43:26.102
I can't hear.

43:41.660 --> 43:44.370
Murderers.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.040
Fascist murderers.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.794
Murderers.

43:51.920 --> 43:55.006
Fascist murderers.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.718
Murderers!

43:59.261 --> 44:03.931
Fascist murderers!
Murderers!

44:04.058 --> 44:06.601
Fascist murderers!

44:06.602 --> 44:08.603
Murderers!

44:13.025 --> 44:17.612
Murderers!
Fascist mur--

44:20.115 --> 44:23.701
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

44:23.952 --> 44:25.870
Motherfucker!

44:25.996 --> 44:26.996
I'll clean it up.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.417
You son of a bitch.

44:31.543 --> 44:34.003
They're killing one of my brothers, 
and what am I doing?

44:34.129 --> 44:37.799
Listening to your fucking Nazi movie!

44:37.925 --> 44:40.343
Don't you know anything?!

44:40.469 --> 44:42.637
Don't you know what the Nazis
did to people?

44:42.638 --> 44:45.431
Jews! Marxists! Catholics!

44:45.557 --> 44:46.641
Homosexuals!

44:46.642 --> 44:48.017
Of course I know.

44:48.143 --> 44:50.478
What do you take me for,
an even dumber broad than I am?

44:50.604 --> 44:53.481
You son of a bitch!

44:53.607 --> 44:55.650
You don't know shit!

44:55.651 --> 44:57.652
Aah!

44:57.778 --> 45:00.780
You wouldn't know reality
if it was stuck up your ass!

45:00.906 --> 45:03.658
Why should I think about reality
in a stinkhole like this?

45:03.659 --> 45:05.993
Why should I get more depressed
than I already am?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.662
You're worse than I thought.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.789
You just use this movies
to jerk yourself off. 

45:09.915 --> 45:12.792
If you don't stop,
I will never speak to you again!

45:12.918 --> 45:14.001
Stop crying!

45:14.128 --> 45:15.920
You sound just like an old woman!

45:16.046 --> 45:17.922
That's what I am.
That's what I am.

45:18.048 --> 45:20.049
What's this between your legs?! 
Huh?!

45:20.175 --> 45:22.468
Tell me, lady!

45:24.430 --> 45:25.847
It's an accident.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.307
If I had the courage,
I'd cut it off.

45:28.434 --> 45:31.269
You'd still be a man.
A man!

45:31.395 --> 45:34.188
A man in prison!

45:34.314 --> 45:38.568
Just like the faggots
the Nazis shoved in the ovens!

45:41.697 --> 45:44.699
Don't look at me like that.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.257
Luis Alberto Molina...

46:01.383 --> 46:03.718
you shall endure the full weight
of the law

46:03.844 --> 46:05.052
and not one day less.

46:05.179 --> 46:08.514
You will be confined
without a chance of parole

46:08.640 --> 46:11.726
for a period of not less
than eight years.

46:13.312 --> 46:16.272
Poor Mama.

46:16.398 --> 46:20.026
Her eyes filled with tears
as if someone had died.

46:20.152 --> 46:23.029
<i>A life full of humiliation</i>

46:23.155 --> 46:25.740
<i>and then the humiliation
of a son steeped in vice,</i>

46:25.741 --> 46:28.451
<i>but she never gave me
that black look.</i>

46:28.577 --> 46:32.163
<i>Her heart broken
by too much suffering,</i>

46:32.289 --> 46:34.165
<i>too much forgiving.</i>

46:36.168 --> 46:39.086
<i>Because of me she could die.</i>

46:49.765 --> 46:53.768
If he ever says 
one unkind word about her,

46:53.769 --> 46:57.563
I'll strangle the son of a bitch.

47:02.611 --> 47:05.404
Him and his filthy words

47:05.531 --> 47:08.533
and his piss-ass revolution!

48:30.198 --> 48:32.617
Get me some water!

48:32.743 --> 48:35.286
It's my stomach.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.663
It's like a bomb exploding.

48:37.789 --> 48:39.248
It's the same thing that happened --

48:39.374 --> 48:40.583
I think it's the food.

48:40.709 --> 48:42.376
We got to get to the infirmary
right away.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.794
- Guard!
- No!

48:43.879 --> 48:45.963
Wait! Stop!

48:46.089 --> 48:47.882
I'm a political prisoner.

48:47.883 --> 48:48.966
Don't be ridiculous.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.593
This is no time
for your damn discipline.

48:50.719 --> 48:52.219
Get away from the door!

48:52.346 --> 48:54.388
Look at me. They gave me a shot,
and I'm better already.

48:54.514 --> 48:55.890
Are you crazy?
That's what they want.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.141
They'll get me hooked on those shots,

48:57.267 --> 48:58.351
and I'll tell them everything.

48:58.477 --> 48:59.352
What are we going to do?

48:59.478 --> 49:00.686
Just leave me alone.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.902
Oh, God.

49:11.782 --> 49:12.949
What about my movie?

49:13.075 --> 49:15.534
It might help you forget the pain.

49:15.661 --> 49:19.288
Later that night,
on the moonlit veranda, 

49:19.414 --> 49:22.416
<i>Leni feels so safe,</i>

49:22.542 --> 49:26.462
<i>so secure in Werner's arms.</i>

49:52.489 --> 49:56.075
<i>Even when the phonograph stops,
they continue dancing.</i>

49:57.619 --> 50:01.205
<i>Dancing and dancing.</i>

50:01.331 --> 50:02.957
<i>Dancing.</i>

50:02.958 --> 50:09.505
To the music of the evening breezes.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.698
Marta.

50:41.455 --> 50:44.331
Who are you?

50:44.458 --> 50:46.500
It's okay.

50:48.503 --> 50:51.047
There, now.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.007
Try to rest.

50:57.179 --> 51:06.062
Marta.

51:10.650 --> 51:14.820
You shouldn't eat this garbage
while you're sick.

51:14.946 --> 51:18.574
I have to get my strength back.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.035
It will only make you worse.

51:21.036 --> 51:25.456
Tastes like... dog piss.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.168
My poor little Valentina.

51:29.294 --> 51:32.588
Don't call me "Valentina".
I'm not a woman.

51:32.714 --> 51:37.051
Well, I've never seen proof
to the contrary.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.886
And you never will.

51:40.931 --> 51:44.183
Now, uh, the clubfoot told...

51:44.309 --> 51:47.061
You'll like this part.
Wait and see. 

51:47.062 --> 51:50.856
<i>The clubfoot told Leni
that her sweet lover</i>

51:50.982 --> 51:53.943
<i>was ordering the execution
of her countrymen every day.</i>

51:54.069 --> 51:56.112
<i>But she refused to believe it.</i>

51:56.238 --> 51:58.823
<i>She only wanted to live this love,</i>

51:58.949 --> 52:02.243
<i>to feel his touch,
to hear his voice.</i>

52:02.369 --> 52:04.286
<i>It's a difficult decision.</i>

52:04.412 --> 52:06.831
<i>Ja, Herr Kommandant.
We captured 10 of them.</i>

52:06.957 --> 52:09.291
<i>They are all French,
but their activities prove</i>

52:09.417 --> 52:11.085
<i>that they are enemies of the people.</i>

52:11.086 --> 52:13.087
They call themselves patriots,

52:13.088 --> 52:15.422
but in fact they're common criminals.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.799
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>

52:16.925 --> 52:18.300
<i>Let the execution take place at dawn.</i>

52:18.426 --> 52:19.927
<i>Jawohl.</i>

52:21.096 --> 52:23.097
Her fingers trembled with the agony

52:23.098 --> 52:25.391
of betraying the man that she loves.

52:31.106 --> 52:34.650
It's like a nail in my gut!

52:39.114 --> 52:41.157
That's better.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.868
Do me a favor and stop all this crap

52:43.994 --> 52:46.120
about beautiful women in tears?

52:50.167 --> 52:52.710
Leni's heart was beating so fast,

52:52.836 --> 52:58.549
that her swelling breasts
leapt out of her low-cut gown,

52:58.675 --> 53:01.093
like luscious <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>
on a silver platter.

53:02.762 --> 53:05.139
Oh, don't make me laugh.
It hurts!

53:05.265 --> 53:08.767
Here.
Have a nice juicy tit.

53:11.146 --> 53:13.147
Have another.

53:14.274 --> 53:16.358
The best places serve them in pairs.

53:16.484 --> 53:21.155
The bucket, quick!

53:21.156 --> 53:23.407
Oh, no!

53:23.533 --> 53:25.117
Ah.

53:28.997 --> 53:31.749
Phew. Christ.
What a smell.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.084
I'm sorry.

53:34.169 --> 53:35.544
You don't know how much it hurts.

53:35.670 --> 53:37.922
Just let it all out.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.174
It can't smell any worse
than it already does.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.093
God, I can't stand this.

53:43.178 --> 53:46.180
You've been through worse.

53:46.264 --> 53:48.182
Much worse.

53:50.810 --> 53:52.061
I'm so ashamed.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.647
Aren't you the one always saying,
"Take it like a man"?

53:54.773 --> 53:56.398
So what's this business
of being embarrassed?

53:56.524 --> 54:00.110
I can't stand this.
I can't stand myself like this.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.820
Take off your pants.

54:01.947 --> 54:05.199
Here.
Come on. Come on.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.410
Cover yourself with this.
Here.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.710
Why do you always have to...

54:16.836 --> 54:20.214
pick on yourself so much?

54:20.215 --> 54:25.135
That's it. That's it.
This one first.

54:25.220 --> 54:29.139
Now this one.
That's it.

54:29.224 --> 54:32.142
Okay, now...

54:32.227 --> 54:33.477
wipe yourself off.

54:33.603 --> 54:36.063
No!
It'll -- It's yours.

54:36.189 --> 54:39.233
No, it's not.
It's ours.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.360
Wipe yourself.

54:48.910 --> 54:50.995
Okay.

54:53.581 --> 54:58.085
There's a little more here...
and here...

54:58.211 --> 54:59.962
Jesus.
Aren't you disgusted?

55:00.088 --> 55:02.506
No, it breaks my heart
to see you like this.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.800
There, almost finished.

55:06.344 --> 55:09.346
Good.
Now take off your shirt.

55:09.472 --> 55:10.806
No. It's all right.

55:10.932 --> 55:13.267
The shirttails are soiled.
Please.

55:15.270 --> 55:19.231
There. That's it.
That's it.

55:24.404 --> 55:28.615
There we go.
Now just a second.

55:28.742 --> 55:32.286
Okay, now, try to stand up.

55:32.370 --> 55:34.079
No, it'll stink.

55:34.205 --> 55:37.041
My weekly shower is tomorrow.

55:37.167 --> 55:41.045
I'll have it all clean by noon.

55:41.171 --> 55:44.673
There we go.
There we go.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.383
There we go.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.844
All wrapped up like a little papoose.

55:48.970 --> 55:50.304
It doesn't disgust you?

55:50.305 --> 55:51.347
Lie down.

55:54.559 --> 55:56.727
There we go.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.980
We don't want you to catch a chill.

56:00.106 --> 56:03.359
What a shame I have no talcum left.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.319
There.
Are you comfortable now?

56:05.320 --> 56:08.322
Yeah, but I'm so cold.

56:08.323 --> 56:11.658
I'll make you a nice hot cup of tea.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.969
This will work wonders.
It's hot -- hot, hot.

56:31.096 --> 56:32.429
You'll burn yourself.

56:39.896 --> 56:42.648
You're very kind, honestly.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.441
I don't know what to say.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.235
Don't burn yourself.

57:00.291 --> 57:04.920
Oh, um, this...
fell out of your shirt.

57:05.046 --> 57:08.757
Go ahead, read it.
I know you've been curious.

57:08.883 --> 57:10.175
No, I only read love letters.

57:10.301 --> 57:12.302
I don't want to know anything
about your politics.

57:12.387 --> 57:16.765
It's from my girlfriend.
Her name is Lydia.

57:16.891 --> 57:18.392
What about Marta?

57:21.396 --> 57:23.105
How do you know about Marta?

57:23.231 --> 57:25.315
You mumbled her name in your sleep.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.692
What else did I mumble?

57:26.818 --> 57:28.735
Nothing.

57:36.411 --> 57:37.411
The letter's from Lydia.

57:37.412 --> 57:39.037
She's my girlfriend in the movement.

57:39.164 --> 57:42.207
Her handwriting is like a child's.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.628
She hasn't had much of an education.

57:49.382 --> 57:52.342
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

57:52.427 --> 57:57.181
During torture, 
whenever I felt close to death,

57:57.307 --> 58:00.142
it was Marta I would think about,

58:00.268 --> 58:02.227
and she would save me.

58:02.353 --> 58:05.647
My whole body ached to hold her.

58:05.773 --> 58:07.941
What's she like?

58:09.444 --> 58:13.113
She's upper class.

58:13.239 --> 58:15.491
Pure bourgeoisie.

58:15.617 --> 58:17.451
She's got everything.

58:17.452 --> 58:22.456
Money, looks, education... freedom.

58:22.457 --> 58:26.084
I'm such a hypocrite.

58:26.211 --> 58:28.462
Just like all those class-conscious pigs.

58:28.546 --> 58:32.090
I must admit, it was convenient.

58:32.217 --> 58:35.886
A safe place to stay

58:36.012 --> 58:39.890
while I was forced to hide.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.935
<i>Until one day I had to tell her</i>

58:43.061 --> 58:45.479
<i>about my other life.</i>

58:48.191 --> 58:51.985
<i>She just listened in silence
like she knew already.</i>

58:52.111 --> 58:54.488
<i>Then she asked me to leave the movement.</i>

58:54.489 --> 58:55.906
<i>But how could I do nothing</i>

58:56.032 --> 58:58.992
<i>when my friends 
were disappearing every day?</i>

59:03.831 --> 59:08.418
<i>I sensed that she was right,
but I had no choice.</i>

59:08.503 --> 59:12.005
<i>So once again
I didn't know what to say.</i>

59:14.634 --> 59:17.094
Things are what they are.

59:20.515 --> 59:24.643
I'll be back in a few days.
Same as always.

59:26.813 --> 59:29.856
I can't take it anymore.

59:29.983 --> 59:34.528
Always waiting, watching the phone.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.905
Always alone.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.648
Valentin...

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:16.486
if you leave, don't come back.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:20.699
Please.
Don't come back.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.579
<i>I no longer believed in violence,</i>

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.497
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.999
<i>As a journalist,</i>

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.793
<i>I was always hearing
about the illegal arrests</i>

01:00:31.919 --> 01:00:34.129
<i>and secret torture.</i>

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:37.883
<i>Then leaking this information abroad.</i>

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.693
<i>My assignment was to meet
one of the last</i>

01:00:56.819 --> 01:01:00.947
<i>surviving members of the original movement.</i>

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:05.869
<i>His code name was Dr. Americo.</i>

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:09.623
<i>He needed my passport
to leave the country.</i>

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.128
Are you all right?

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:18.674
A little tired.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.636
You should have left a long time ago, 
Dr. Americo.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.805
This is where I'm needed.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.598
I keep wondering if it's all worth it

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.975
when nothing really changes.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:36.900
Well, good luck.
Here's your passport.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:40.570
Take care of yourself.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.656
Thank you.

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:49.287
<i>He had accomplished almost nothing,</i>

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:54.126
<i>but I was glad I could help him.</i>

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:07.806
Freeze!

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:09.683
Stop!

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:13.019
Here! Open your legs!
Open your legs!

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.694
Move!

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.032
<i>What happened to Marta?</i>

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.869
<i>I don't know anything for sure except...</i>

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.705
I'll never see her again.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.583
Don't say that.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:38.211
I don't deserve to die in this cell.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:43.133
I only confessed some code names
they already knew.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:47.429
I can't stand being a martyr.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.098
It infuriates me.

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:52.434
I don't want to be a martyr.

01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:58.982
My whole life, a mistake.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.525
No.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.822
Give me your hand.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.624
I don't want to die, Molina.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:21.755
I don't want to die.

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:28.929
Don't let me die.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.764
Of course not.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.186
You look thin, Molina.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.687
What's the matter?

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:41.691
It's nothing. I was sick,
but I'm better now.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.026
So stop trembling.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:45.737
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:51.660
Arregui doesn't suspect anything, does he?

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:52.786
No, sir.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.791
What has he told you?

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.754
Well...

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.798
nothing yet.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.092
He...

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:10.720
I feel I should proceed very cautiously.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:14.224
Molina, you are lying.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.229
What are you hiding?

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.898
Nothing. How can you accuse me
when I almost died for you?

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.901
He insisted...
that I eat the bowl with the poison.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:27.904
Why?
You made a mistake there.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.615
One plate had twice as much
as the other one,

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.742
so he insisted I eat
the larger portion.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:36.788
Sir, you told me that the poison food 
would be in a --

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.332
in a new tin plate.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:43.670
Well, they loaded it up so much,
I had no choice.

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:45.255
I had to eat it myself

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.549
or he would have become suspicious.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.468
Poor Molina.
I'm sorry for the mix-up.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:53.847
I commend you.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.852
Sit down, here.

01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:00.645
Please.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:05.859
Your mother is feeling much better

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.903
since she learned you may be paroled.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.279
Really?

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.781
Of course, so stop crying.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.533
You should be pleased.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.744
It's from happiness, sir.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:19.122
What did Valentin say about his cadre?

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.752
His what?

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:26.087
His group.

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:29.758
Who they are.
Where they meet.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:33.136
Nothing, sir.
He -- He is very sick.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:37.557
If he has any more poison,
I don't know what will happen.

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:42.187
His girlfriend.
What did he say about her?

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:45.899
He says that personal things...

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.901
are secondary to the revolution.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:50.904
He thinks everything else is trash, so...

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:54.908
I think he's warming up
to talking about it.

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.287
For me?

01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:02.248
Thank you.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.919
What did he say about the new prisoner?

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:07.921
The one across the hall.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:11.925
The one who's all messed up.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:15.136
He said no crime justifies
that kind of punishment.

01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:18.306
This coffee really hits the spot.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:20.934
Did he tell you his name?

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.063
Of course, sir.
It's Valentin Arregui.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.731
No, you idiot!

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:31.945
The name of the new prisoner.

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:35.490
Of course not.
He's always wearing a hood.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:38.952
Who put a hood on him?

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:42.372
It's routine.
He's political.

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.457
How do you expect him to talk

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:47.085
if he can't even see the bastard's face?

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.753
It won't happen again.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:56.720
Molina, we've got to know everything 
they are planning.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.931
As soon as he sees
that new prisoner's face,

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:03.560
he will spill his guts.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.938
Remember every damn word he says.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.399
Yes, sir.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:13.987
The quicker he talks,
the quicker you get out.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:19.993
Now, get back to work.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:26.458
Uh, warden?
Um, one more thing.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:30.920
Um, he heard the guards say
that my mother was coming.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:34.049
And I had told him
that she always brings me

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.717
a bag full of groceries,

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:39.220
and... I don't want him
to get suspicious.

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:43.016
Okay.
Dictate what she brings.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:45.977
To you, sir?

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.564
Yeah, to me.
And make it quick. I'm busy.

01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:56.071
Um...

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.073
Two roast chickens in butter...

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.283
um...

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.619
egg salad...

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.037
canned peaches...

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.539
uh...

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:10.335
condensed milk,
two bags of -- of tea --

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:14.464
one regular and one chamomile...

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.716
a jar of pickled herring.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:19.928
Four bars of toilet soap.
What else?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.096
Um...

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.307
Blessed Mary, my mind's a blank.

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.475
What else? Let me think.
Um...

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.063
Uh...

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.358
Rye bread, sugar, I need.
Um...

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:37.694
roast chickens...
canned peaches...

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:40.948
Cheddar cheese. Mmm.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.992
Mmm.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:44.993
Rye bread.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.078
What happened?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.999
Look at this.
Two roast chickens.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.667
Two!
How about that?

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.627
Just watch how fast you get better now.

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:55.087
Your mother came?

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:58.091
Yes. Tea!

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.093
Um... oh...

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:03.011
sugar.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.098
And...

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:10.185
cigarettes.

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:14.232
That's great. How is she?

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:16.693
Oh, she's much better.
Much better. Thank you.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:21.072
And look...
at all she brought me.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.866
I mean "us".

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.450
Well, really that's all meant for you.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.327
No, you have to stop eating
that damn prison chow,

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.871
and you'll feel better in no time.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.080
You think so, huh?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.081
You're damn right I do.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.624
Starting today a new life begins.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.877
Oh, and I took a chance...

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:37.796
and left the sheets out to dry...

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:40.633
and no one walked away with them,

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:44.136
so tonight we both have clean sheets.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.430
Nice going.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:48.099
Just let me get this started and...

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:50.810
presto.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:53.145
In a few minutes,
you'll be licking your fingers.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:55.523
I expect you to eat all of these chickens, 
both of them.

01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:58.151
Well, what about you?

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:00.904
I'm not gonna just let you 
sit around and drool.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.781
No, I have to keep an eye
on my girlish figure,

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.783
or at least what's left of it.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.410
Not yet.
That's for dessert.

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.420
Mmm.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.672
Would you like some more peaches?

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:22.759
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:31.184
Good food, good cigarette.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.436
I don't remember when I felt so good.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:38.441
There's only one thing missing.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.818
Christ!

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.112
And I thought I was supposed
to be the one

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.198
who was the degenerate around here.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.533
No, no.
I mean a good movie.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.369
Oh, of course!

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:53.206
Geez, why didn't I think of that?

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.916
Your Nazi movie.
How does it end?

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.209
I thought you hated it.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.212
Yeah, but I'm curious to see
how it turns out.

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:02.215
Well, let's see...

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:07.220
<i>They are dining at the majestic table</i>

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.931
<i>in Werner's chateau.</i>

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:13.518
<i>As Werner begins to notice</i>

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:17.313
<i>Leni's cold distance...</i>

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:23.152
she, suddenly, impulsively... 

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:27.824
<i>hurls her wine glass
across the room and says...</i>

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.617
I refuse to love a man

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:32.495
who is the butcher of my country!

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.085
Oh, my love.

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:43.673
Come with me,
and you will understand.

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:49.595
Werner takes her
to this government archive

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:52.307
filled with photos and documents

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.185
about famine throughout the world.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.480
<i>He shows her how the elite</i>

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:05.278
<i>create false shortages
to enslave the masses.</i>

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:09.032
<i>Leni is deeply moved</i>

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:13.786
<i>and begins to see things
through Werner's eyes.</i>

01:12:13.912 --> 01:12:17.707
<i>From that moment on,</i>

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:21.836
<i>Leni understood Werner's mission --</i>

01:12:21.962 --> 01:12:26.090
<i>to liberate humanity from injustice</i>

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:28.384
<i>and domination.</i>

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.346
<i>As they leave the baroque archive,</i>

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:35.725
<i>Leni feels the anguish
in her heart being transformed</i>

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.061
<i>back to her previous admiration,</i>

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.314
<i>but this time...</i>

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:45.318
<i>with the depth of a love...</i>

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.029
<i>reborn.</i>

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:51.199
Oh, my love.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:55.828
How could I ever have doubted you?

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:59.791
She begs him to forgive her...

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:04.337
and promises to help ensnare his enemies.

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:07.131
She arranges this secret meeting

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.884
with the head of the Resistance,

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.220
<i>by telling him
that she will give the map --</i>

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.346
<i>Remember the map?</i> 

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.141
<i>Only to him.</i> 

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:48.423
I believe this...

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.800
is what you want.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.302
Yes.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:55.304
Well done.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:04.397
So often, I was tempted to steal it 
from him myself,

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:09.402
but some things are best done by a woman,

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:14.323
a woman who betrays the man she loves.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:19.412
And there is something else
I have wanted...

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:23.833
almost as much as the map.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.461
What?

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:30.047
You know very well.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.425
Hmm?

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:36.637
I've prepared a lavish banquet for two.

01:14:36.763 --> 01:14:38.723
I'm not hungry.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.349
I am...

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:42.435
for you.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.449
Aah!

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:11.941
Leni.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.112
<i>Werner hears her sing.</i>

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:20.866
She sings like never before.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.537
She sings of her eternal love for him

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:28.416
and begs him not to cry,

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:32.545
because her sacrifice was not...

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.547
in vain.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.556
The end.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:49.604
Well, what'd you think?

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.565
You told it well.
Next time, tell one I like.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.609
Come off it.
The love story was divine.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.902
Forget about the rest.
It's so perfect.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:58.195
When Leni...

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.574
What's going on?

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:07.038
What is it?

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.605
That guy is Americo.

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:33.856
Who?

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:37.234
The man with my passport!

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:38.611
God.

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.615
They don't know he's here.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.784
Who doesn't know?

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.578
Please, Valentin.
Maybe I can help.

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.775
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:21.529
Turn the other way, will you?

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:22.655
Why?

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:23.823
Because you'll laugh.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.825
At what?

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.661
Something on any healthy man,
that's all.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.747
Whoo. A hard-on.

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:35.960
Well, that is healthy.
Shall I close my eyes, too?

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.011
Hey, I missed breakfast.
Why didn't you wake me?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.222
I told the guard
not to bring us anything

01:18:48.348 --> 01:18:49.807
as long as our food holds up.

01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:52.685
Damn it, Molina.
Stop running my life for me!

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.361
They already took him away.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.037
I didn't want to wake you.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:16.041
The water's almost hot
if you want some tea.

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:26.093
Here.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.723
- Have some cake.
- You eat it.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.475
Oh, come on,
let me spoil you a little.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.351
Back off, Molina.

01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:38.105
It's not my fault
they killed your friend --

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:40.733
Shut up!
You damn faggot!

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.741
Look.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:52.745
Oh! Oh, Luisa.
My favorite friend.

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:49.426
Look... at all the wonderful things 
Mama brought me.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:52.263
Here's a special treat!

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:59.645
Assorted bonbons.

01:21:05.735 --> 01:21:08.821
What's the matter?
You don't like candy?

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.948
About the --

01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:12.992
this morning.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.995
Uh, about my temper.
I'm really sorry.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.454
Oh, nonsense.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:21.250
It -- It wasn't even you
I was mad at.

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:24.628
I've been thinking
maybe I am mad at you.

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:26.839
Why?

01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:29.884
Because you're so kind.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:33.804
I don't --

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.807
I don't want to feel obligated
to treat you the same way.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.643
"Unable to take.

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:42.354
Unable to give."

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:55.701
Every day he opens up
more and more with me.

01:21:55.827 --> 01:21:59.204
Just give me a few more days.
I'm sure he'll talk.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:04.043
If he doesn't,
he'll be interrogated again.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.794
And thoroughly this time.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:07.379
But he's too weak to be tortured.

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:09.173
And if he drops dead,
we all lose out.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:11.634
I can't take anybody being nice to me

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.969
without asking anything in return.

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.305
If I'm very nice to you
it's because...

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.891
I want your friendship and...

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:21.644
No -- Yeah.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.354
And...

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.523
Why not say it?
Your affection.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.817
The same way that I try
to be good to my mother,

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:30.361
who's never harmed anyone

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:33.197
and who accepts me for what I am
and loves me.

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:35.658
It's...

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.911
It's like a gift from heaven...

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:43.123
and the only thing
that keeps me going.

01:22:43.249 --> 01:22:45.459
The only thing.

01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:49.421
And you, too,
are a very good person.

01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:50.881
Very selfless and devoted.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.342
Risking your life for your ideals, 
ready to die,

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.469
even in here,
for what you believe in.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.430
Am I embarrassing you?

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.265
No.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:03.978
Well, sir, there might be a way
to speed this up.

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:07.773
I'm not sure, but I'm...

01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:09.650
It's just a hunch.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:11.694
Say it straight, Molina.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.946
Well, you know how inmates are, sir.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:18.325
When --
When a cellmate leaves...

01:23:18.451 --> 01:23:21.495
they feel all sentimental and helpless.

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:23.288
So, um...

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:25.332
Well, he's gotten a bit attached to me,

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:27.876
so if he thought
that I was being released,

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.503
he's bound to open up and talk,

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:33.340
get a few things off his chest.

01:23:33.466 --> 01:23:34.967
What do you think?

01:23:36.928 --> 01:23:40.431
So, that's why I respect you
and like you...

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:42.558
and hope that you feel
the same way about me.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.519
So I want us always to be friends.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:47.271
Sure.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:50.983
The reason I...

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:53.986
wanted to get this in the open is...

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.113
because I may be leaving,

01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:57.990
since I just heard from the warden

01:23:58.074 --> 01:23:59.992
that I may be paroled soon.

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:01.827
When?

01:24:01.953 --> 01:24:04.663
Tell him that you're up for parole,

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:08.042
that we are going to move you
to another cell in 24 hours.

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:11.128
Yes, sir.

01:24:11.254 --> 01:24:13.422
And this is your last chance,
so get going.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.382
You've got 24 hours.

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:17.009
One thing, sir.

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:19.678
You can't catch a fish without bait.

01:24:19.804 --> 01:24:21.555
I, um, I need more food.

01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:25.893
This time, sir,
I've prepared a list.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.105
They'll probably move me
to another cell in 24 hours.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:32.149
My lawyer says that's the procedure.

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.821
I don't want to get my hopes 
up too high.

01:24:37.947 --> 01:24:39.490
Do you want an apple?

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:41.825
No, thanks.

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:44.161
I guess I should be happy for you.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:47.247
I don't know.

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:49.333
Yes. All I wanted in life
was to get out of here

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:50.709
and take care of my mother.

01:24:50.835 --> 01:24:53.045
Nothing else mattered,
but now that my wish might be...

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:57.800
Be happy, damn it.
I'd give anything to get out.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.927
But is it fair?

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:02.304
What?

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.681
That I always end up with nothing?

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.684
That I don't have anything
truly my own in life?

01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:09.061
You've got your mother.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.939
Yes, but listen, though,
she's had a life and lived it.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:16.610
She had a husband and a son.
But I'm still waiting.

01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:17.986
At least she's still alive.

01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:21.031
But so am I.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.699
When is my life supposed to begin?

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.077
When do I strike it lucky
and have something for my own?

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.621
Right now you just got lucky.
Take advantage of it.

01:25:27.747 --> 01:25:30.290
You're getting out.

01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:35.754
And do what?
Hang out with my friends?

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.384
A bunch of silly old queens like me?

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.762
Tell a few jokes till I can't stand 
the sight of them,

01:25:43.888 --> 01:25:45.514
because they're a bunch of mirrors

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.517
that send me running for my life.

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:51.728
My life of waiting for nothing?

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.865
Tell a movie.
You'll feel better.

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:14.835
Once upon a time...

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:20.174
in a tropical island far away...

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:26.138
there lived a strange woman.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:30.058
<i>She wore a long gown</i>

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:32.227
<i>of black lamÃ©</i>

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:36.148
<i>that fit her like a glove.</i>

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.567
<i>But the poor thing --</i>

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:43.155
<i>she was caught in a giant spider web</i>

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.366
<i>that grew out of her own body.</i>

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:54.166
<i>One day...</i>

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:59.213
<i>a shipwrecked man 
drifted onto the beach.</i>

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:10.933
She fed him
and cared for his wounds.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:16.521
She nourished him with love
and brought him back to life.

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:21.568
When he awoke...

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:29.826
he gazed up at the spider woman...

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.162
and saw...

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:37.501
<i>a perfect teardrop</i>

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:40.545
<i>slide from under her mask.</i>

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.549
<i>Why is she crying?</i>

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.180
I don't know.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:54.351
Why do you always need explanations?

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:59.314
Valentin, I'm so tired.
I'm tired of suffering.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.108
You're not the only one they've hurt.

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.859
You don't know.

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:08.907
I hurt so much inside.

01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:11.243
Where does it hurt you?

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:14.246
In my neck and shoulders.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:18.000
Why does the sadness 
always jam up in the same spot?

01:28:20.336 --> 01:28:22.921
Please don't touch me.

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:32.264
Can't a friend even pat your back?

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:35.475
It only makes it worse.

01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:37.519
Why?

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:42.983
'Cause I've fallen in love with you.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:51.283
I'm sorry, Valentin.
I wish it hadn't happened.

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:59.916
I understand.
Don't be ashamed.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.522
Can I touch you?

01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:28.528
If it doesn't disgust you,
I'd like you to.

01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:52.177
Can I touch your scar?

01:29:52.303 --> 01:29:54.471
Sure.

01:29:54.597 --> 01:29:56.723
Oh.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:29.005
Do what you want with me
because that's what I want.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:31.591
If it doesn't disgust you.

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:36.346
Okay.

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:59.161
You are so kind to me.

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:01.580
No.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:04.416
You're the one who's kind.

01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:33.570
Wait, I'm squeezed against the wall.

01:31:33.696 --> 01:31:36.448
That's better.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:39.576
No, wait, let me lift my legs.

01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:50.879
You know, when I woke up,
I put my hand to my eyebrow...

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.340
to feel my scar.

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:54.758
You don't have one.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:58.470
Like I wasn't me anymore.
As if somehow...

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:01.014
I was you.

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:06.436
Look, let's not talk about this.

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:10.106
Let's not talk about anything at all.

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:12.943
Just for this morning,
I'm asking.

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:17.489
Aren't you going to ask me why?

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.491
Why?

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:22.369
Because I'm happy.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:24.955
I'm really happy,
and I don't want to spoil it.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:33.171
The nicest thing about feeling happy...

01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:39.553
is that you think you'll never feel 
unhappy again.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:47.519
You shit-face motherfuck.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.645
Talk!

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:53.275
Let me handle this.

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:58.363
Look at me, Molina.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.912
What's the matter?

01:33:06.038 --> 01:33:08.373
You're afraid this group will kill you?

01:33:08.499 --> 01:33:09.874
Is that it?

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:13.253
No, sir, I want to help.

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:14.588
So what did he say?

01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:18.550
Nothing.

01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:22.804
Wouldn't it be worse
if I told you something

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.557
that was not true?

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:31.479
I'll have to move you
to another cell, Molina.

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:32.897
No, sir, please don't do that.

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:34.399
As long as I'm with him,

01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:37.152
there's still a chance
that he might talk.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:42.115
You faggot piece of shit!

01:33:42.241 --> 01:33:46.703
You fell in love with that bastard!

01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:51.374
Okay, Molina.
You can go.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.296
Get your things ready.
You're leaving today.

01:33:56.422 --> 01:33:57.505
Here.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:02.594
The minister approved your parole.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.471
Oh. God.
Thank you, sir.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.932
Thank you.

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:16.524
And no more hanky-panky
with the little boys.

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:18.485
Oh, no, sir.
I swear.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:25.492
They --
They would never suspect you.

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:28.119
I mean, really,

01:34:28.245 --> 01:34:29.663
there's no risk at all.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:31.206
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.541
I'm --
I'm just too afraid.

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:36.419
All you have to do
is give them a message...

01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:37.796
from any public phone.

01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:40.298
No. No names.
No phone numbers. Nothing.

01:34:40.424 --> 01:34:43.218
I'm terrified of the police.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.637
Okay.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:50.642
I guess I shouldn't drag you into this.

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:55.605
I swear, Valentin.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:35:01.236
My only desire 
is to stay here with you.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.655
Take care of yourself.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:14.541
Valentin, I've only ever loved
two people in my life.

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:16.167
My mother and you.

01:35:16.293 --> 01:35:19.087
I'm gonna miss you, Molina.

01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:32.308
At least the movies.

01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:35.687
Yeah.
Whenever I go to sleep,

01:35:35.688 --> 01:35:38.231
I'll probably be thinking
of you and your...

01:35:38.357 --> 01:35:40.024
crazy movies.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:46.489
Whenever I see bonbons,
I'll be thinking of you.

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.951
Valentin, there's something
I'd like to ask you

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:52.162
that you've never done,
although we've done much more.

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:57.041
A kiss.

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:01.838
Okay, but first promise me something.

01:36:01.964 --> 01:36:04.299
I told you I can't,
and I'm so sorry.

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.968
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:12.724
Promise me you will never let
anybody humiliate you again.

01:36:12.808 --> 01:36:16.394
That you'll make them respect you.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.272
Promise me you'll never let
anybody exploit you again.

01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:22.400
Nobody has the right to do that to anybody.

01:36:25.529 --> 01:36:27.739
I promise.
Thank you.

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.745
Valentin?

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.712
What? The kiss?

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.256
No. The...

01:36:45.382 --> 01:36:47.550
The phone number.

01:36:58.562 --> 01:37:03.566
Wait a few days.
Dial two times, then hang up.

01:37:03.692 --> 01:37:05.610
The third time...

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.481
Molina. Let's go.

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:53.825
Wait.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.166
Good luck, Molina.

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:03.543
Come on.

01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:08.983
A beer.

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.085
<i>Subject was granted a special parole</i>

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:28.920
<i>by the minister of justice</i>

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:32.465
<i>on orders from the Department
of Political Surveillance.</i>

01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:35.927
<i>The department believes
he will lead our agents</i>

01:39:35.928 --> 01:39:38.721
<i>to the cadre of Valentin Arregui.</i>

01:40:35.946 --> 01:40:39.115
Mama?

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:22.116
Whoo-hoo! Luisa!

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:24.744
Look who's here.

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:27.705
Nice to see you!

01:41:27.831 --> 01:41:32.043
The return of the leopard woman!

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:36.798
Don't pay attention to them.
You look great!

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:39.717
10 years younger, darling.
Doesn't she?

01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:42.261
Let's watch the show.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:04.117
Oh, shut up,
you bunch of faggots!

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:08.996
Now I would like to welcome home
a very dear friend,

01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:10.832
a cherished sister,

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:14.836
who spent Lord knows
how many precious nights

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:19.090
to pay a stupid debt
to this hypocritical society.

01:42:19.174 --> 01:42:23.886
This is for you, lovely Luisa.

01:43:02.634 --> 01:43:06.429
<i>Surveillance reveals subject 
has not returned to work</i>

01:43:06.555 --> 01:43:08.848
<i>and almost never leaves home.</i>

01:43:08.974 --> 01:43:12.143
<i>He spends his evenings
staring out the window</i>

01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:15.146
<i>for no apparent reason.</i>

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:20.067
You sure you won't eat something?

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:21.694
Just coffee.

01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.530
You want to talk, Molina?
Is there something wrong?

01:43:27.159 --> 01:43:29.368
No, I'm just not going
to see you for a while.

01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:30.912
I'm going away.

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:34.832
With another boy?

01:43:34.958 --> 01:43:38.044
That's good.

01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:40.087
Don't get arrested again.

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:42.381
You're too old for it.

01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:29.113
I have a message from Valentin Arregui.

01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:33.409
Yes, a pay phone.

01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:41.751
Excuse me, is that really necessary?

01:45:47.424 --> 01:45:49.383
Um, all right.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.844
Um...

01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:54.263
I'll be wearing a red scarf.

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:01.312
You don't have to close the account.

01:46:01.313 --> 01:46:03.272
There's no penalty if you maintain --

01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:05.483
Yes. Thank you.
Do you have an envelope, please?

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:08.319
Thank you.

01:46:16.661 --> 01:46:19.413
Now, this...

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:22.333
is for Mama.

01:46:22.459 --> 01:46:24.960
To take care of her while I'm gone.

01:46:25.087 --> 01:46:26.629
Please.

01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:31.884
All right, I'll handle it.

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:36.347
Wherever you're going,
it's probably for the best.

01:46:57.369 --> 01:47:00.454
Mama, you look so beautiful.

01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:07.044
Remember, Mama, when I was little

01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:09.463
and you used to come into my room

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:11.090
and kiss me good night.

01:47:11.216 --> 01:47:12.967
I always pretended to be asleep,

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:16.387
but I was always waiting for your kiss.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:20.015
And though you're sleeping now,

01:47:20.142 --> 01:47:22.393
I know you understand me.

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:34.321
It's time for me
to take care of my own life.

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:42.538
You understand, don't you, Mama?

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.090
Don't be sad.

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.843
Go that way.
Move, quick.

01:51:29.391 --> 01:51:31.266
Who are you?

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:33.852
I have a message from Valentin.

01:51:33.978 --> 01:51:34.853
Are you Lydia?

01:51:34.979 --> 01:51:36.647
Yes. Get in quick.

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:37.731
Get him!

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:49.743
Molina! Stop!

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:52.663
Stop, Molina!

01:52:39.043 --> 01:52:42.045
Get the car.
Move. Hurry!

01:52:53.349 --> 01:52:56.727
Stand up. Move.
Get in the car!

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:02.733
The number.

01:53:02.734 --> 01:53:05.527
Tell me the telephone number,

01:53:05.653 --> 01:53:08.155
and you go to the hospital.

01:53:11.034 --> 01:53:13.744
Talk, you fucking fag!

01:53:13.745 --> 01:53:16.789
The number!

01:53:45.068 --> 01:53:48.779
<i>Subject was shot to death
by the extremists.</i>

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.197
<i>His recent activities,</i>

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.699
<i>such as closing his bank account,</i>

01:53:52.784 --> 01:53:56.787
<i>suggest that he planned
to escape with them.</i>

01:53:56.788 --> 01:53:58.789
<i>Also the way he was shot</i>

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:00.707
<i>seems to indicate that he had agreed,</i>

01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:04.795
<i>if necessary, to be eliminated by them.</i>

01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:08.006
<i>In any case, it appears that
he was more deeply involved</i>

01:54:08.132 --> 01:54:09.925
<i>than we suspected.</i>

01:54:15.765 --> 01:54:16.849
This is morphine.

01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:21.937
So you can get some rest, okay?

01:54:22.063 --> 01:54:24.940
Oh, my God.

01:54:25.066 --> 01:54:26.984
The way they worked you over.

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:29.820
Okay.

01:54:29.946 --> 01:54:33.156
Just don't tell anyone about this, 
or I'll lose my job.

01:54:35.243 --> 01:54:38.829
Just count to 40
and you'll be asleep.

01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:00.851
<i>Marta...</i>

01:55:04.856 --> 01:55:09.067
Come, Valentin.
Come with me.

01:55:09.193 --> 01:55:13.488
Don't be afraid.
You won't wake up in the cell.

01:55:28.296 --> 01:55:30.422
<i>What about Molina?</i>

01:55:30.548 --> 01:55:33.592
<i>Come, my love.</i>

01:55:33.718 --> 01:55:40.557
<i>Only he knows
if he died happy or sad.</i>

01:55:55.865 --> 01:55:59.284
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:55:59.410 --> 01:56:01.954
<i>That's the one thing
I never said to you</i>

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.915
<i>because I was afraid
of losing you forever.</i>

01:56:20.932 --> 01:56:24.851
<i>That can never happen now.</i>

01:56:24.936 --> 01:56:28.188
<i>This dream is short...</i>

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:32.484
<i>but this dream is happy.</i>
