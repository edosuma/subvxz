00:54.661 --> 00:56.562
Go on! Go on!

01:53.285 --> 01:55.253
Anything of use, Henry?

01:55.287 --> 01:57.255
I didn't see much, sir.

01:57.289 --> 01:59.257
The man who ran away was of medium build,

01:59.291 --> 02:02.259
long black coat, but I didn't see his face.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.361
Sir, looks like his throat's been slit.

02:04.395 --> 02:06.196
If it had, there'd be significantly

02:06.230 --> 02:10.033
more blood. I suspect we'll
find he's been garroted.

02:10.068 --> 02:12.069
It's a new one for me, sir.

02:14.072 --> 02:17.340
- Good God!
- What is it, sir?

02:17.375 --> 02:20.677
It appears to be a human thumb.

02:25.324 --> 02:26.892
Definitely garroted.

02:27.275 --> 02:29.242
Knee to the back and wire pulled tight.

02:29.277 --> 02:31.244
- Silent and effective.
- I don't believe

02:31.279 --> 02:33.346
the traditional method was used, Inspector.

02:33.381 --> 02:35.681
This wound suggests that
a similar force was applied

02:35.715 --> 02:38.450
all the way around the neck,
except for this one inch

02:38.485 --> 02:41.320
at the back. The area is bruised

02:41.354 --> 02:43.322
as though something was pressed against it.

02:43.356 --> 02:45.424
- Some kind of device?
- Perhaps a wire loop

02:45.458 --> 02:48.127
attached to a pole of some sort.

02:48.162 --> 02:51.664
And the thumb you found in his
pocket was severed recently.

02:51.698 --> 02:54.166
- Pre or post mortem?
- Yet to be determined.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.735
Murdoch...

02:56.770 --> 02:58.804
I know this scumbag.

03:01.941 --> 03:04.376
- "William McCann."
- Billy McCann is what

03:04.411 --> 03:07.179
he went by. He's was a
low-life, worked for Bernie King.

03:07.213 --> 03:09.647
- "The bookmaker."
- Yeah. King never does

03:09.682 --> 03:12.284
his own dirty work. Prefers
to swan around his club.

03:12.318 --> 03:15.187
Sirs, there's been another murder.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.026
Is he dead?

03:21.060 --> 03:23.128
Move along, young lady.
There's nothing to see.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.363
- Oh, my God!
- Madam, thank you.

03:25.397 --> 03:27.398
Dr. Grace, what have we?

03:27.433 --> 03:29.934
He was found by the gardeners
this morning. He was beaten.

03:29.968 --> 03:31.703
I have detected six blows.

03:31.737 --> 03:34.439
This one to the head
here was likely lethal.

03:34.473 --> 03:36.941
- So a beating then?
- Yes, but

03:36.975 --> 03:39.276
- this was no random killing.
- What makes you say that?

03:39.311 --> 03:41.946
He is missing a thumb.

03:43.982 --> 03:46.650
- Oh.
- We've a man with a thumb

03:46.684 --> 03:49.820
to spare lying in the morgue.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.556
- "Professor Gideon Galbraith."
- What's a professor's thumb

03:52.590 --> 03:54.591
doing in the pocket of a known felon?

03:57.595 --> 03:59.463
- Afraid so.
- You make sure that...

03:59.497 --> 04:01.531
No doubt you can explain this, Murdoch?

04:01.566 --> 04:04.401
It's statistical notation, sir.

04:04.435 --> 04:08.438
He seems to be combining
Bayesian theory of probability

04:08.473 --> 04:11.608
and Galton's regression formula.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.810
So that's what they're up to these days.

04:13.845 --> 04:17.646
- They, sir?
- High-forehead types.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.949
Hmm. I believe his motives

04:19.983 --> 04:21.985
may have been more
practical than academic, sir.

04:22.019 --> 04:24.387
He's been tabulating race results.

04:24.421 --> 04:26.389
He was gambling.

04:26.423 --> 04:28.424
I think he was looking for a way

04:28.458 --> 04:30.559
to statistically determine race winners.

04:30.594 --> 04:32.561
He had a system, did he?

04:32.596 --> 04:34.930
Not something a bookie would appreciate.

04:34.964 --> 04:37.700
You're thinking what I'm thinking?

04:37.734 --> 04:40.669
We should pay Bernie King a visit.

04:46.576 --> 04:48.944
Good day, gentlemen. You
chaps wouldn't be playing

04:48.978 --> 04:51.947
- for money now, would you?
- Inspector Brackenreid.

04:51.981 --> 04:54.049
- Always a pleasure.
- Murdoch,

04:54.083 --> 04:57.019
meet Bernie King, the biggest bookmaker

04:57.053 --> 04:59.388
in Toronto. No need for flattery.

04:59.422 --> 05:02.690
And I can assure you this
is a game amongst friends.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.601
We're here about your boy, McCann.

05:04.602 --> 05:07.214
We found him this morning with
a severed thumb in his pocket.

05:07.232 --> 05:10.434
- Good Lord!
- The thumb belonged to a murder victim:

05:10.469 --> 05:13.304
Gideon Galbraith, a mathematics professor.

05:13.338 --> 05:16.508
- One of your clients perhaps?
- I know Mr. Galbraith.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.510
We understand he invented

05:18.544 --> 05:20.378
a system for predicting race winners.

05:20.412 --> 05:22.380
He may have thought he had

05:22.414 --> 05:25.349
a system. That would explain
why he bet so heavily.

05:25.384 --> 05:28.619
- He didn't win?
- Let's just say his losses...

05:28.653 --> 05:30.621
exceeded his winnings.

05:30.655 --> 05:33.790
He owed you money. Maybe
that's why you had him killed.

05:33.825 --> 05:35.659
Gentlemen, it would
hardly be in my interest

05:35.693 --> 05:37.794
to kill someone that owed me money.

05:37.829 --> 05:41.632
- It would if they couldn't pay.
- People can always pay.

05:41.666 --> 05:44.100
They may not be able to
pay all at once, but...

05:44.135 --> 05:46.102
arrangements can be made,

05:46.137 --> 05:49.139
methods of persuasion brought to bear.

05:49.173 --> 05:51.508
Such as sending one of your
low-lifes to cut off his thumb.

05:51.543 --> 05:53.910
Except Mr. McCann got a
little overenthusiastic

05:53.944 --> 05:55.945
and killed him. This seems a matter

05:55.979 --> 05:57.947
you should discuss with Bill McCann.

05:57.981 --> 06:00.983
Unfortunately, Mr. McCann is also dead.

06:01.018 --> 06:04.320
- He's dead?
- Oh, don't look so surprised, Bernard.

06:04.355 --> 06:06.656
I reckon you couldn't have
McCann crying into his beer

06:06.690 --> 06:09.859
over a murder that was tied
to you, so you got rid of him.

06:09.893 --> 06:12.127
Well, you seem to have it all worked out,

06:12.162 --> 06:15.731
so let me just say this: if Bill
McCann cut off anyone's thumb,

06:15.766 --> 06:18.968
it wasn't at my behest and I
had nothing to do with his death!

06:19.002 --> 06:21.537
And if you two think otherwise
you had best make your case.

06:21.572 --> 06:24.506
So until then, good day, gentlemen.

06:28.945 --> 06:30.912
- What have you, Doctor?
- I compared the thumb we found

06:30.947 --> 06:32.914
in Mr. McCann's pocket with the remnant

06:32.949 --> 06:36.151
on Professor Galbraith's
hand. It didn't match.

06:36.186 --> 06:38.420
- It didn't match?
- The detached thumb is indeed

06:38.455 --> 06:40.422
from a right hand, but
the size is different,

06:40.457 --> 06:42.458
as was the angle of the cut.

06:42.492 --> 06:45.961
You mean there's someone else
out there missing a thumb?

06:45.995 --> 06:48.229
What the hell is going on, Murdoch?

06:48.263 --> 06:50.632
I don't know, sir.
Clearly, these two murders

06:50.666 --> 06:53.635
must be related somehow. I'll have George

06:53.669 --> 06:56.270
look into McCann's last movements.

06:56.305 --> 06:58.473
George, we just received a call

06:58.507 --> 07:01.109
about a domestic disturbance
in St. John's ward.

07:01.143 --> 07:04.011
A neighbour's complaining about
a ruckus in the house next door.

07:04.045 --> 07:06.314
Well, you see to it, Jackson.
I'm in the middle of something.

07:06.348 --> 07:09.250
The address is 114 Agnes Street.

07:09.284 --> 07:11.986
I just thought you should know.

07:14.456 --> 07:15.856
Edna?

07:15.890 --> 07:19.159
Simon? Edna?

07:19.193 --> 07:22.496
Go away, George.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.732
What did he do?

07:24.766 --> 07:26.667
Show me.

07:28.637 --> 07:30.604
You can't do anything, George.

07:30.639 --> 07:33.706
Edna, let me see, please.

07:38.646 --> 07:40.614
Oh, for the love of God...

07:40.648 --> 07:42.582
I've never seen him
like this before, George.

07:42.617 --> 07:44.651
Where's Simon?

07:44.685 --> 07:46.753
He tried to help me and, and...

07:46.787 --> 07:48.755
Archie turned on him, and he ran away.

07:48.789 --> 07:51.290
You can't be here, George.

07:51.324 --> 07:54.127
If Archie comes back, he'll kill you.

07:54.161 --> 07:56.696
He'll kill me?! After what
he did to you he'll kill ME?!

07:56.730 --> 08:00.900
- And he'll kill me too.
- No. I'll never let that happen.

08:00.934 --> 08:03.136
Now, is there somewhere you can stay?

08:03.170 --> 08:05.437
- No.
- You'll stay with me.

08:05.472 --> 08:07.906
No, George. Please.

08:07.940 --> 08:09.908
He could be watching us right now.

08:09.942 --> 08:11.877
If he's not watching us,
then the neighbours are.

08:11.911 --> 08:13.712
Alright, lock the door.

08:13.746 --> 08:16.515
If he returns, I want you to go
out the back and come straight

08:16.550 --> 08:20.152
to the Station House. Promise me.

08:20.187 --> 08:23.155
Edna, I'm not gonna leave
until you promise me!

08:23.189 --> 08:25.057
I promise.

08:25.091 --> 08:28.660
He will never lay another
finger on you or Simon again.

08:28.695 --> 08:30.729
That's my promise to you.

08:40.339 --> 08:42.340
Thank you very much.

08:44.876 --> 08:46.877
- George!
- Doctor.

08:46.912 --> 08:48.879
I hear congratulations are in order.

08:48.914 --> 08:50.448
What?

08:50.482 --> 08:54.419
- Your promotion to detective.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

08:56.454 --> 08:59.389
I apologize, Doctor, I've
not been myself today.

08:59.424 --> 09:02.326
Yes, I did hear about
Edna's husband coming back.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.394
- I'm so sorry, George.
- It's become more complicated

09:04.429 --> 09:06.396
than that now, I'm afraid.

09:06.431 --> 09:08.899
Things are really upside down right now.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.901
Well, if you ever need to talk,

09:10.936 --> 09:13.270
my door is always open.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.572
I appreciate that, Doctor,

09:15.607 --> 09:19.443
but I believe this is something
I'll have to settle on my own.

09:19.477 --> 09:23.146
Perhaps the thumbs are trophies.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.283
You think this could be the
work of a sequential killer?

09:26.317 --> 09:28.718
We do have two confirmed
murders and a thumb

09:28.753 --> 09:31.354
- suggesting a third.
- Hmm...

09:31.388 --> 09:34.090
Sir, pardon the interruption.

09:34.125 --> 09:37.060
Another body's been found off Duchess Lane.

09:37.094 --> 09:39.395
That's just around the corner.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.507
Owner of the thumb perhaps.

09:54.978 --> 09:56.945
Sir, his name is Ronald Richards.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.114
His wife reported him missing last night.

09:59.149 --> 10:01.716
Apparently he's an
exterminator. Pests and vermin.

10:01.751 --> 10:04.586
Rigour has subsided. He's
been dead at least 12 hours.

10:04.620 --> 10:07.089
That's longer than the other two.

10:07.123 --> 10:10.225
George, can you arrange for
transportation to the morgue?

10:10.260 --> 10:11.726
Sir.

10:11.761 --> 10:14.863
Mr. Richards was the first
of our three victims to die,

10:14.898 --> 10:16.999
by an hour or two perhaps.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.000
He was strangled with some force.

10:19.034 --> 10:21.336
And the thumb, Doctor?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.377
It's a match.

10:33.085 --> 10:35.626
I don't understand why
whould someone kill him?

10:36.351 --> 10:39.386
No enemies?

10:39.421 --> 10:41.188
No.

10:41.223 --> 10:45.026
He never said an angry word
against anyone. Even his boss.

10:45.060 --> 10:48.795
Why would he have reason
to be angry with his boss?

10:48.830 --> 10:50.998
He was let go from his job last month.

10:51.032 --> 10:53.634
He had a bad ankle.

10:53.668 --> 10:55.836
Couldn't climb the stairs no more.

10:55.870 --> 10:59.173
But he was the best exterminator around.

10:59.207 --> 11:02.343
How did he earn his living?

11:02.377 --> 11:04.344
He didn't.

11:04.378 --> 11:06.346
I got work cleaning.

11:06.380 --> 11:10.851
Mrs. Richards, did your
husband ever gamble?

11:10.885 --> 11:15.255
No. He was very careful with his money.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.996
No connection between
Richards and McCann then?

11:24.031 --> 11:26.699
- None that I can see.
- Sirs.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.369
I looked into Mr. Richard's
affairs as requested.

11:29.403 --> 11:31.371
I did find something unusual.

11:31.405 --> 11:33.005
Just last week,

11:33.040 --> 11:35.308
he took out a sizable life insurance policy

11:35.342 --> 11:38.844
with a double indemnity in case
of accidental death or murder.

11:38.879 --> 11:41.747
Just last week? What's the payout?

11:41.782 --> 11:43.716
2000 dollars.

11:43.750 --> 11:47.019
Small fortune. Do you
think the wife did him in?

11:47.054 --> 11:50.389
I don't think so, sir. She
seemed genuinely heartbroken.

11:50.423 --> 11:53.659
- Perhaps he got McCann to kill him.
- Possibly.

11:53.693 --> 11:56.094
Though, it's one thing to
arrange for your own murder;

11:56.128 --> 11:59.164
yet another to arrange to
be one of three murders.

11:59.199 --> 12:02.701
- And why the thumbs?
- A timeline seems

12:02.735 --> 12:05.304
to be developing. Our
killer, possibly McCann,

12:05.338 --> 12:08.440
first kills Mr. Richards,
followed by Professor Galbraith.

12:08.474 --> 12:11.676
And then McCann gets garroted.

12:11.711 --> 12:14.913
- Sirs.
- Don't tell me...

12:22.121 --> 12:23.521
Doctor.

12:23.555 --> 12:25.656
It appears the killer doesn't discriminate.

12:25.691 --> 12:28.158
- Crikey!
- She was opened from hip

12:28.193 --> 12:31.462
to sternum by a large blade.
Possibly a hunting knife.

12:31.496 --> 12:33.397
It's the same killer all right.

12:33.432 --> 12:35.533
Fourth body in 24 hours:

12:35.567 --> 12:38.135
either deficit or surplus in thumbs.

12:38.169 --> 12:41.572
Copy of The Racing Sheet.

12:41.607 --> 12:43.540
Cigar cutter.

12:43.574 --> 12:45.909
I assume these belonged to her?

12:45.944 --> 12:48.445
They were here when she was found.

12:48.479 --> 12:50.781
A cigar-chewing gambler
who liked to shoot arrows.

12:50.815 --> 12:53.250
Rather sorry I never got to meet her.

12:55.519 --> 12:59.021
If she was an archer,
perhaps Julia knew her

13:02.560 --> 13:04.628
Her name was Mildred Abernathy.

13:04.662 --> 13:06.630
She was our top archer.

13:06.664 --> 13:09.699
- One of the Abernathys?
- Indeed.

13:09.734 --> 13:11.801
So, no need of money then.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.570
And nothing in common
with the other victims.

13:13.604 --> 13:16.172
Except for the missing thumb.

13:16.206 --> 13:18.174
Is it always the thumb of the right hand?

13:18.208 --> 13:20.509
So far.

13:20.543 --> 13:23.579
Ritualistic perhaps, another
mark of a sequential killer.

13:23.613 --> 13:25.681
Yes, but the choices of victims

13:25.715 --> 13:27.683
and methods of killing are so different.

13:27.717 --> 13:29.718
And how did one of his
trophies get in the pockets

13:29.753 --> 13:31.820
of one of our victims?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.022
Perhaps Mr. McCann is
our sequential killer.

13:34.056 --> 13:35.991
And someone then killed him?

13:36.025 --> 13:37.993
Yes, but McCann's murder was different.

13:38.027 --> 13:40.362
His thumb wasn't taken.

13:40.397 --> 13:42.364
Perhaps someone knew what he was up to

13:42.399 --> 13:44.366
and decided to stop the madness.

13:44.401 --> 13:46.368
Dr. Grace, we need to know

13:46.403 --> 13:48.536
if Miss Abernathy was
killed before Mr. McCann.

13:48.570 --> 13:50.972
You'll have a time-of-death
estimate shortly.

13:51.007 --> 13:54.475
Hey, I don't get it.

13:54.510 --> 13:57.913
Sir! I think you dropped the wallet.

14:01.851 --> 14:04.519
Back to old habits are we?

14:04.589 --> 14:07.658
Simon, I know you tried
to help your mother.

14:07.692 --> 14:10.093
- Yes, for all the good it did.
- Where's your father now?

14:10.127 --> 14:12.629
I don't know.
- Simon, your father can't...

14:12.664 --> 14:15.366
He needs to be apprehended
and punished for what he did!

14:15.400 --> 14:17.368
And then what? You catch him,

14:17.402 --> 14:20.704
- he goes to jail, and he gets out. You can't fix this.
- Simon!

14:20.739 --> 14:23.706
You're the reason this
happened! Just leave us alone!

14:31.715 --> 14:33.917
I have a time of death
for Mildred Abernathy.

14:33.951 --> 14:36.686
She was killed within the past five hours.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.288
After McCann was already dead.

14:39.322 --> 14:41.758
So he can't be the killer.

14:41.792 --> 14:43.793
Right. So we have a common thug,

14:43.827 --> 14:45.795
an exterminator, a mathematician,

14:45.829 --> 14:48.964
and a wealthy heiress. What connects them?

14:48.999 --> 14:51.100
Two of them liked to play the ponies.

14:51.134 --> 14:52.869
Yes, but two of them didn't.

14:52.903 --> 14:55.570
Three of them needed
the money but one didn't.

14:55.605 --> 14:58.073
There's no common denominator.

14:58.108 --> 15:00.042
Crabtree, where have you been?

15:00.076 --> 15:02.278
Dealing with a personal matter, sir.

15:02.312 --> 15:04.780
Sod your personal matters!
We need you on this case!

15:04.814 --> 15:07.816
I'm on this case, sir, that's why I'm here.

15:07.850 --> 15:09.851
We've just received word.
Another body's been found.

15:13.122 --> 15:15.123
Lord.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.530
Sirs.

15:21.564 --> 15:24.566
He was found by a resident
of the boarding house.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.135
- Any witnesses?
- Not as yet.

15:27.169 --> 15:30.338
"Horace Blechman." An inventor, it seems.

15:30.372 --> 15:33.041
"542 Wilton Avenue."

15:33.075 --> 15:35.176
That's just down the street.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.978
Crabtree, you and Higgins
ask around. It's a busy area,

15:37.012 --> 15:39.647
there has to be witnesses. Sir.

15:41.716 --> 15:44.652
- Missing thumb.
- Hmm...

15:46.254 --> 15:49.056
I have to cancel our
dinner plans this evening.

15:49.090 --> 15:51.659
But I had something rather special planned.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.928
I'm sorry. I'm expecting another body. I...

15:53.962 --> 15:55.763
This is very unusual.

15:55.797 --> 15:58.566
Oh, it's just so exciting, I can't wait.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.533
I just received a letter
from a close friend

16:00.568 --> 16:02.936
of mine in London,
England. A friend of hers,

16:02.971 --> 16:05.638
Mrs. Pankhurst, is
forming a suffragette union

16:05.673 --> 16:07.874
and she's just put out a call
for international supporters.

16:07.908 --> 16:09.876
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:09.910 --> 16:12.679
Yes. Think of it, Emily.
London will set the tone

16:12.713 --> 16:15.048
for the rest of the world.
They'll have a real influence.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.650
Going there to join them could
be the adventure of a lifetime.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.687
- Going there?
- Together.

16:22.656 --> 16:25.124
Why, you certainly know how
to take a girl's breath away.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.327
Perhaps a change of scene would be welcome.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.363
You're up to your elbows
in blood and entrails.

16:30.397 --> 16:33.866
- Yes, I know.
- Well, don't you agree

16:33.900 --> 16:36.068
- it's a thrilling prospect?
- Of course, but I...

16:36.103 --> 16:38.170
Wonderful! We'll discuss
it when you're done here.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.406
Lillian?

16:42.709 --> 16:45.577
Thank you, sir. If you hear
of anything else, let us know.

16:50.349 --> 16:52.818
- Any luck?
- None.

16:52.852 --> 16:55.587
Can you imagine five murders
in the space of one day?

16:55.622 --> 16:58.423
This puts us in league with
London or New York even.

16:58.457 --> 17:01.560
Oh, that's wonderful, Higgins.
A first-class city at last.

17:01.594 --> 17:05.497
- Is everything alright, George?
- Everything's fine, stop asking.

17:05.531 --> 17:08.866
It's the first time I asked.

17:08.901 --> 17:12.037
You go back to the station
house; I'll finish up here.

17:12.070 --> 17:14.704
Suit yourself.

17:28.353 --> 17:30.655
What is all this, Murdoch?

17:30.689 --> 17:33.958
Sir, I believe Mr.
Blechman aspired to create

17:33.992 --> 17:37.828
a train that levitated by
means of magnetic repulsion.

17:37.863 --> 17:39.963
A train that floats in the air?

17:39.997 --> 17:42.166
Bloody ridiculous! Man was crackers.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.134
Yes, well, you aren't

17:44.169 --> 17:46.903
the only one that thought
so. It appears he was trying

17:46.938 --> 17:49.373
to get funding for this
invention without much luck.

17:49.407 --> 17:51.442
"We regret to inform you that we are not

17:51.476 --> 17:53.910
presently interested in your invention.

17:53.945 --> 17:56.613
Regarding your letter
requesting capital funds,

17:56.647 --> 17:59.182
we wish to thank you for
your interest, but... "

17:59.216 --> 18:01.718
Rejection letters. He
was a poor man's Pendrick.

18:01.752 --> 18:03.720
So it would seem.

18:03.754 --> 18:06.222
Murdoch, here's another
copy of The Racing Sheet.

18:06.256 --> 18:08.758
Yes. Sir, do you think it's possible

18:08.793 --> 18:10.794
that he was gambling to raise the money?

18:10.828 --> 18:13.329
Well, that's interesting.

18:13.363 --> 18:15.764
He's placed a bet on the
seventh race at Woodbine.

18:15.799 --> 18:19.435
- What's interesting about that?
- Well, there is no seventh race at Woodbine.

18:19.470 --> 18:22.238
Horace Blechman placed a bet
on a race that doesn't exist.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.202
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I'm locking up here.

18:41.236 --> 18:43.904
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

18:43.939 --> 18:46.540
- Your name?
- Arnold Paulson.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.408
Is there a problem?

18:48.443 --> 18:52.113
Yes. Mr. Paulson, do you
print this race sheet?

18:52.147 --> 18:54.781
Yes. Today's issue's done
and dusted. I'm off to my bed.

18:54.815 --> 18:58.485
How and when do you receive
the details for each race sheet?

18:58.519 --> 19:01.555
It comes by one of the street
boys they use as their runners.

19:01.589 --> 19:05.058
Right. Mr. Paulson, how do you explain

19:05.092 --> 19:07.794
the presence of a non-existent
race in your paper?

19:07.828 --> 19:09.796
The seventh race at Woodbine.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.931
Oh, that. Yes, it's strange, I know.

19:11.966 --> 19:14.267
Two nights ago, a second
envelope was delivered

19:14.301 --> 19:16.269
just before my deadline.

19:16.303 --> 19:19.139
It contained the horses to
that seventh race along with $5.

19:19.173 --> 19:22.909
- So you printed it?
- Who am I to turn down $5?

19:22.943 --> 19:25.678
Right. And did you receive a
similar envelope last night?

19:25.712 --> 19:29.482
I did. I assumed it
was a lark of some kind.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.418
Mr. Paulson, may I have a
copy of today's Racing Sheet?

19:32.452 --> 19:33.986
Certainly.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.259
So the seventh race at
Woodbine is listed once again,

19:40.294 --> 19:42.361
but this time there are only four horses.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.362
There were nine yesterday.

19:44.397 --> 19:46.698
So five fewer today.

19:46.732 --> 19:48.633
A coincidence that there are
five bodies in our morgue?

19:48.667 --> 19:51.902
Could you please list off
the five missing horses?

19:51.937 --> 19:53.805
"Rat Trapper."

19:53.839 --> 19:56.907
That would be Ronald
Richards, the exterminator.

19:56.942 --> 19:59.076
"Jailbird" is likely our friend McCann.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.078
- McCann.
- "Artemis."

20:01.112 --> 20:03.080
The goddess of the hunt!

20:03.114 --> 20:05.149
Mildred Abernathy, the archer.

20:05.183 --> 20:07.351
Murdoch, "Pythagoras."

20:07.385 --> 20:09.887
Professor Galbraith, the mathematician.

20:09.921 --> 20:11.922
That leaves only one.

20:11.957 --> 20:13.824
Horace Blechman, the inventor.

20:13.859 --> 20:15.893
"Butcher's Gaff.

20:15.927 --> 20:17.895
"Soldier Boy. Twisted Oliver.

20:17.929 --> 20:21.097
Big Game Hunter. Dare to Dream."

20:21.131 --> 20:23.667
Dare to Dream. Suits that man to a tee.

20:23.701 --> 20:25.502
All those daft projects he was working on.

20:25.536 --> 20:28.438
Horace Blechman, inventor.

20:28.473 --> 20:30.273
What have you, George?

20:30.307 --> 20:32.275
Sir, I looked into Miss
Abernathy as you requested.

20:32.309 --> 20:34.578
It seems her apparent wealth was just that.

20:34.612 --> 20:36.579
She was in debt up to
her ears from gambling.

20:36.613 --> 20:38.581
One roulette game away
from penury, it seems.

20:38.615 --> 20:41.918
We have our common denominator:
they were all in need of money.

20:41.952 --> 20:45.554
Perhaps this isn't the
work of one or two killers.

20:45.589 --> 20:48.758
Could the victims be killing each other?

20:48.792 --> 20:51.294
I suppose.

20:51.328 --> 20:53.429
McCann killed Richards.

20:53.463 --> 20:55.364
He had the thumb in his pocket.

20:55.399 --> 20:57.366
Blechman was an inventor.

20:57.401 --> 21:00.035
Perhaps he invented the garroting
device that killed McCann.

21:00.069 --> 21:02.104
That's very good, sir. That would explain

21:02.138 --> 21:06.041
why Blechman had Jailbird
checked off in his Racing Sheet.

21:06.075 --> 21:09.778
That's a very good thought,
Julia. The question is why?

21:09.812 --> 21:14.149
Could they all be contestants
in some kind of murderous game?

21:14.183 --> 21:17.252
A fight to the death, like gladiators.

21:17.287 --> 21:19.221
Well, they are all in need of money;

21:19.255 --> 21:22.057
perhaps if the prize
is a significant sum...

21:22.091 --> 21:24.793
To be claimed by the last
man or woman standing.

21:24.827 --> 21:26.795
What about the severed thumbs?

21:26.829 --> 21:30.064
- Sir, proof of their kill.
- Thumbmarks,

21:30.098 --> 21:33.067
which is why it was taken
only from their right hand.

21:33.101 --> 21:34.936
If we're right about this,
four contestants remain:

21:34.970 --> 21:37.605
"Butcher's Gaff, Soldier
Boy, Twisted Oliver,

21:37.640 --> 21:39.808
Big Game Hunter."

21:39.842 --> 21:42.643
Right, George, we'll
stake out the print shop.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.980
We'll apprehend whoever
delivers the envelope tonight.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.649
Yeah. No, I got it.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.364
You're late, George. What kept you?

22:04.398 --> 22:07.167
Oh, does it matter, sir?
I'm almost never late.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.972
And you aren't wearing
your police-issue boots.

22:12.006 --> 22:15.041
I... I... I stepped in horse muck
just outside my boarding house.

22:15.076 --> 22:17.043
I didn't have time to clean
them. If I'd cleaned them,

22:17.078 --> 22:19.379
I'd be more late than I am now!

22:19.413 --> 22:22.215
Is everything all right, George?

22:24.218 --> 22:26.152
Yes, sir. I apologize for my tardiness.

22:35.261 --> 22:37.964
Here we go.

22:37.998 --> 22:40.299
You there!

22:40.333 --> 22:44.069
Toronto Constabulary! Give me that.

22:44.104 --> 22:47.106
- Who gave you this?
- The race manager, sir,

22:47.140 --> 22:49.141
from the Woodbine Race Track.

22:49.175 --> 22:51.276
Sir?

22:51.311 --> 22:53.879
It's legitimate race information.

22:53.913 --> 22:56.915
No seventh race. I suppose we wait.

22:56.949 --> 22:59.518
We wait.

23:05.290 --> 23:08.059
Sir, I apologize for
snapping at you earlier.

23:08.093 --> 23:10.094
I've been wound fairly tight lately.

23:10.129 --> 23:13.064
- That's alright, George.
- No, it's not, sir.

23:13.098 --> 23:17.903
- We may never work together again and I...
- You're anticipating your move

23:17.937 --> 23:20.038
to Station House Number 3 of course.

23:20.072 --> 23:22.073
I just want to thank you, sir,

23:22.107 --> 23:25.910
for your counsel and...
for your friendship.

23:25.944 --> 23:28.246
It's been invaluable to me.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.281
And whatever the future brings...

23:32.217 --> 23:34.252
... I'm glad to have served
under you these years.

23:34.286 --> 23:37.220
We may not always work together, George,

23:37.255 --> 23:40.290
but we'll always be friends.

23:51.102 --> 23:52.402
Right then.

23:57.442 --> 24:00.910
- No seventh race tonight.
- You've already begun printing.

24:00.945 --> 24:03.246
Be done in an hour if you want to wait.

24:03.281 --> 24:05.449
- Hmm.
- What do you think sir?

24:05.483 --> 24:07.917
Thank you. Let's go home, George.

24:07.952 --> 24:10.086
We'll try again tomorrow.

24:19.096 --> 24:21.631
Julia.

24:21.665 --> 24:24.366
Have you noticed George
acting a bit strange lately?

24:24.401 --> 24:28.370
William, you have to
give him a little leeway.

24:28.405 --> 24:31.840
George is dealing with
difficult matters of the heart.

24:31.874 --> 24:34.943
Hmm.

24:37.947 --> 24:40.349
Hello?

24:40.383 --> 24:42.384
Yes.

24:44.621 --> 24:47.823
Alright, Doctor, I'll be right there.

24:47.857 --> 24:50.025
Another murder?

24:50.059 --> 24:53.394
Another two.

24:53.429 --> 24:56.531
- I'm coming with you.
- That's not necessary, Julia.

24:56.565 --> 24:58.900
I'm sure Emily could use my help.

25:17.485 --> 25:19.820
It appears Miss Abernathy
was not only a victim

25:19.855 --> 25:21.822
but also a killer.

25:21.857 --> 25:25.700
- His right thumb is missing.
- She had a cigar cutter in her purse.

25:25.715 --> 25:29.396
- An efficient tool for the job.
- Good gracious!

25:29.430 --> 25:32.966
I always thought Mildred so genteel.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.570
But she was died before
this man's body was found.

25:36.604 --> 25:39.105
He was killed at least 24 hours ago.

25:39.140 --> 25:41.408
He was found early this morning
in his cold storage room.

25:41.442 --> 25:44.511
- Cold storage?
- In a butcher shop.

25:44.546 --> 25:48.515
- That would make him Butcher's Gaff.
- And what of the other body?

25:48.550 --> 25:50.650
Male approximately 30 years old.

25:50.685 --> 25:53.153
He was shot several times.

25:53.187 --> 25:55.388
Time of death between 9 and 11pm.

25:55.422 --> 25:57.323
Sir, this tattoo,

25:57.357 --> 25:59.159
that's a regimental crest,

25:59.193 --> 26:02.428
so this could be Soldier
Boy. Indeed, George.

26:02.462 --> 26:05.665
But his thumbs are intact.

26:05.699 --> 26:07.766
Well, perhaps his assailant shot him

26:07.801 --> 26:10.903
and was then interrupted before he
could retrieve his proof of kill.

26:10.937 --> 26:14.607
- Similar to the McCann murder.
- Exactly.

26:14.641 --> 26:18.511
Julia, it appears we have
the body of Soldier Boy here.

26:18.545 --> 26:22.214
Two more down, two to go.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.193
Thank you.

26:34.227 --> 26:36.795
Paper! Get your paper!

26:36.830 --> 26:39.097
I'll pick up a copy of
this morning's Racing Sheet.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.399
Oh, don't bother, Julia.
I spoke with the printer;

26:41.434 --> 26:43.735
he said that there is no seventh race.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.938
I'll get one anyway.

26:46.972 --> 26:49.474
William, look at this.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.512
There is a seventh race at Woodbine listed.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.848
- There is?
- With a new entry.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.784
- "Artful Detective."
- Artful Detective...

27:02.587 --> 27:04.355
Ah! William!

27:10.295 --> 27:12.463
Wait!

27:12.497 --> 27:15.432
Oh, my goodness!

27:18.169 --> 27:20.604
Did you see that?

27:22.140 --> 27:24.007
He's dead.

27:24.041 --> 27:27.077
William, what on earth just happened?!

27:27.111 --> 27:29.445
Julia...

27:29.480 --> 27:31.782
I believe I may be the Artful Detective.

27:53.686 --> 27:56.021
George.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.357
- What?
- Have you brought in

27:58.391 --> 28:00.359
Mr. Paulson yet from the printing shop?

28:00.393 --> 28:04.029
Sir, he's gone. His place has
been completely cleared out.

28:04.064 --> 28:06.265
He's nowhere to be found.

28:06.299 --> 28:08.900
Right. Join us, please.

28:10.936 --> 28:13.805
"Artful Detective"? I'm not
quite sure about the artful bit.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.665
They must have thought it made
for a better "horse's name."

28:16.666 --> 28:17.466
"They," sir?

28:17.543 --> 28:20.144
Whoever's responsible for this "game,"

28:20.179 --> 28:22.180
which includes the printer.

28:22.214 --> 28:24.182
They must have thought that
you were getting too close,

28:24.216 --> 28:25.516
so they've thrown you into the
game without your knowledge.

28:25.550 --> 28:28.519
- Not quite cricket.
- Yes, and now the printer

28:28.553 --> 28:31.022
has disappeared along with our best lead.

28:31.056 --> 28:33.212
If you are in the game,
get yourself to the armoury.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.685
Don't want you taking any chances.

28:34.696 --> 28:37.461
Sir, if we are to find
out who's behind this,

28:37.496 --> 28:40.231
we'll need to capture our subject alive.

28:40.356 --> 28:42.690
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

28:42.724 --> 28:45.993
I invented this some time ago

28:46.027 --> 28:50.030
but it proved to be somewhat
cumbersome for daily use.

28:50.064 --> 28:51.765
What is that?

28:51.800 --> 28:54.267
It's a weaponized capacitor!

28:54.302 --> 28:57.937
It delivers an electrical
shock by way of these darts.

28:57.972 --> 29:00.673
- Sort of like an electric gun?
- Exactly.

29:00.708 --> 29:03.176
It overwhelms the
attacker's nervous system.

29:03.211 --> 29:05.345
- Rendering him paralyzed.
- Temporarily.

29:05.380 --> 29:07.347
I hope.

29:07.382 --> 29:10.117
I... I haven't exactly tested it, yet.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.652
Well, I'm sure we can find
a couple of volunteers.

29:12.686 --> 29:15.287
Jackson, get yourself in here!

29:15.322 --> 29:17.657
Sir, I... I really don't think that...

29:17.691 --> 29:19.325
We're not taking any chances, Murdoch.

29:19.359 --> 29:20.793
Sir.

29:20.828 --> 29:23.062
The detective is gonna test
his new invention on you.

29:23.096 --> 29:25.031
It might hurt a bit, so brace yourself.

29:25.065 --> 29:27.800
Uh... Alright.

29:27.835 --> 29:29.636
Sir I really don't think that we should...

29:29.670 --> 29:32.905
- We need to make sure it works.
- It could kill him.

29:32.939 --> 29:36.308
What? Um...

29:36.343 --> 29:38.310
Jackson, as you were.

29:38.345 --> 29:41.180
Thank you, sir.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.083
Sir, no matter how effective
this electric gun is,

29:44.117 --> 29:46.085
you're up against killers.

29:46.209 --> 29:49.111
Not killers, George, a killer.

29:49.145 --> 29:52.114
Soldier Boy and Twisted Oliver
are now out of the picture;

29:52.148 --> 29:54.249
that only leaves Big Game Hunter.

29:54.283 --> 29:56.618
How are you gonna find Big Game Hunter?

29:56.653 --> 29:58.854
Sir, I believe he is going to find me.

29:58.888 --> 30:02.290
Sir, I insist on coming with
you. The man is clearly dangerous.

30:02.324 --> 30:04.626
He's bloody dangerous! Big Game Hunter.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.761
It's all in the name,
Murdoch. It's all in the name.

30:06.795 --> 30:08.963
I appreciate your concern, gentlemen,

30:08.997 --> 30:12.333
but I have a plan. And it
all begins at the hotel.

30:19.408 --> 30:21.375
Oh, don't worry, Julia,

30:21.409 --> 30:24.411
I'll be back shortly.

30:24.445 --> 30:27.181
Please be careful, William.

30:27.215 --> 30:29.216
Of course.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.566
Murdoch, that was bloody brilliant!

31:54.600 --> 31:56.968
It worked.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.970
Sir, take him to the Station House.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.272
- I will question him shortly.
- Where are you going?

32:01.306 --> 32:03.440
I owe it to my wife to let her know

32:03.475 --> 32:05.409
that she didn't become a widow today.

32:05.443 --> 32:07.078
Fair enough.

32:07.112 --> 32:11.515
Lads, cart this lump of
rubbish off to the cells.

32:37.942 --> 32:40.677
Oh, George! Thank you!

32:42.513 --> 32:44.447
How did you know he would attack me?

32:44.481 --> 32:47.417
Sir, just a lucky guess.

32:47.451 --> 32:50.953
George, this man is a soldier.

32:50.987 --> 32:53.923
Could this be Soldier Boy?

32:53.957 --> 32:56.258
Perhaps, sir.

32:56.293 --> 32:58.594
If so, who do we have in our morgue?

32:58.629 --> 33:01.897
I don't know.

33:04.735 --> 33:08.670
Winner was to receive a prize of $10,000.

33:08.705 --> 33:12.274
Why you would join such
a murderous undertaking?

33:12.309 --> 33:14.276
You need the money?

33:14.311 --> 33:16.712
I did it for the sport, of course.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.714
The ultimate sport.

33:18.748 --> 33:21.683
I have faced off against
many a ferocious beast,

33:21.718 --> 33:24.886
but none as deadly as man himself.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.922
What were the rules of this game?

33:30.393 --> 33:32.561
We met before the hunt began,

33:32.595 --> 33:34.663
agreed on one thing only.

33:34.697 --> 33:38.432
Killing of any non-participant
meant instant disqualification.

33:38.467 --> 33:40.969
Apart from that, there
were no restrictions.

33:41.003 --> 33:43.905
Any time. Any place. Any weapon.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.640
And you chose a hunting
knife as your weapon

33:46.675 --> 33:48.776
Always. It's the only way

33:48.810 --> 33:50.979
to measure yourself against your quarry.

33:51.013 --> 33:54.382
Who organized this?

33:54.416 --> 33:57.284
I don't know his name, but you may have

33:57.318 --> 34:00.354
an opportunity to meet him
face to face, Detective.

34:00.389 --> 34:02.690
How is that?

34:02.724 --> 34:04.692
You're the victor,

34:04.726 --> 34:07.461
the last man standing.

34:10.498 --> 34:14.101
How am I to collect my prize?

34:14.135 --> 34:16.103
You know what? The chimney sweep!

34:20.041 --> 34:23.076
Detective Murdoch, Inspector.

34:23.110 --> 34:25.212
How can I help you?

34:25.246 --> 34:27.281
I'm here to collect my winnings.

34:29.750 --> 34:34.186
I'm the last man standing, I
believe I'm entitled to $10,000.

34:34.221 --> 34:36.889
Of course, we'll accept a
confession in lieu of that.

34:36.924 --> 34:39.692
Confession? For what?

34:39.726 --> 34:42.094
I've committed no crime.

34:42.129 --> 34:44.897
None of the contestants
were compelled to enter.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.033
Everyone participated
of their own free will,

34:47.067 --> 34:48.967
each for their own reasons,

34:49.002 --> 34:52.371
whether it be debt,
greed, thrill of the hunt.

34:52.406 --> 34:54.706
You preyed on base human weakness.

34:54.741 --> 34:56.809
You turned the entire city into a coliseum

34:56.842 --> 34:58.811
for your gladiators.

34:58.845 --> 35:00.712
Were any innocent citizens harmed?

35:00.747 --> 35:02.748
I don't recall a single example.

35:04.684 --> 35:07.052
Bernard King, you are
under arrest for murder.

35:07.086 --> 35:10.489
- But I didn't kill anyone, Detective.
- Well then, you'll be

35:10.523 --> 35:12.758
surprised to learn that
conspiracy to murder

35:12.792 --> 35:16.428
- carries the same penalty.
- Why did you risk

35:16.463 --> 35:18.997
getting caught by putting
Artful Detective in the race?

35:19.031 --> 35:22.467
It was a gamble. He may
have survived or he may have

35:22.501 --> 35:25.937
been killed. It's...
it's all part of the game.

35:25.972 --> 35:28.306
Is that so?

35:28.341 --> 35:31.142
Well, Bernard, me old mucker,

35:31.177 --> 35:33.244
now you're playing my bloody game!

35:33.279 --> 35:35.412
Walk this way, sunshine!

35:45.440 --> 35:47.242
I thought you might be hungry.

35:47.276 --> 35:49.244
Oh, how thoughtful.

35:49.278 --> 35:51.246
It's tea and scones.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.415
You're trying to convince
me of the charms of England.

35:54.449 --> 35:58.218
Hm, I hope it's my own
charms that will sway you.

36:00.121 --> 36:02.390
- Oh, do say yes, Emily.
- I am charmed,

36:02.424 --> 36:04.157
but I have to think about my job.

36:04.192 --> 36:06.126
There are mortuaries in London,

36:06.160 --> 36:08.095
- I dare say.
- It's not that easy.

36:08.129 --> 36:10.564
I can't just walk into a
position in any mortuary.

36:10.599 --> 36:13.934
So don't. We'll be doing
something more important.

36:15.703 --> 36:17.971
What I do here is important, Lillian.

36:18.006 --> 36:20.040
I'm a woman, I'm doing
my part for the movement

36:20.074 --> 36:22.042
just by being here.
I'm living in the fight;

36:22.076 --> 36:24.044
you're just talking about it.

36:24.078 --> 36:27.614
Well, I'm not just
talking about it anymore;

36:27.648 --> 36:30.350
I'm doing something about it.

36:30.385 --> 36:32.886
You can either come
with me or you can stay!

36:32.920 --> 36:35.021
I won't accept such a ridiculous ultimatum!

36:35.055 --> 36:38.190
Well, it appears you've
given me your answer!

36:38.225 --> 36:41.160
I suppose I have!

37:23.735 --> 37:26.104
Emily.

37:26.138 --> 37:28.639
I got your message. Is something wrong?

37:28.674 --> 37:32.444
I thought there might be
something you wanted to tell me.

37:32.478 --> 37:34.479
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

37:36.815 --> 37:39.484
George, I identified the
soldier in the morgue.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.487
It's Archibald Brooks, Edna's husband.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.990
You saw the body. You knew who it
was. Why didn't you say something?

37:46.024 --> 37:47.625
Emily, I...

37:47.659 --> 37:50.761
George, the detective
is waiting on my report,

37:50.796 --> 37:52.697
What am I supposed to tell him?

37:54.866 --> 37:56.800
You do what you must.

37:56.834 --> 37:58.802
George, please talk to me.

37:58.836 --> 38:01.605
What are you hiding? What's going on?

38:01.639 --> 38:04.074
Emily, goodbye.

38:07.379 --> 38:10.981
You're absolutely certain
that it's Archibald Brooks?

38:11.015 --> 38:12.983
There was scarring from
shrapnel on the corpse.

38:13.017 --> 38:14.539
I checked the regiment's medical records.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.397
Sergeant Brooks was injured in a barrage.

38:16.587 --> 38:19.823
- Detective...
- Yes, I know, Doctor.

38:19.857 --> 38:23.159
George was there when the body
was first brought to the morgue.

38:23.193 --> 38:25.161
He would have known that it was Mr. Brooks,

38:25.195 --> 38:27.163
and not Soldier Boy.

38:27.197 --> 38:29.999
- Do you think he could have...
- Doctor,

38:30.034 --> 38:32.068
Brooks was shot,

38:32.102 --> 38:35.038
- what was the calibre?
- .22 pistol.

38:49.586 --> 38:51.921
That's a .22.

38:51.955 --> 38:55.357
What has George done?

39:20.015 --> 39:22.083
Sir.

39:45.773 --> 39:47.408
Sir.

40:17.971 --> 40:20.273
Explain yourself, Crabtree.

40:20.307 --> 40:22.307
Your boots match

40:22.342 --> 40:24.510
the bloody footprints
at the scene of the crime

40:24.544 --> 40:26.846
The murder weapon was found in your desk!

40:28.782 --> 40:31.017
George, if you have an explanation,

40:31.051 --> 40:33.019
now is the time to speak.

40:36.322 --> 40:40.225
For godsakes, man, have you
not got a tongue in your head?!

40:40.260 --> 40:43.328
Did you kill him?

40:43.363 --> 40:45.364
Did you kill Brooks?

40:50.570 --> 40:52.971
George, please, speak in your defense!

40:53.005 --> 40:56.641
Sirs, I have a right to silence.

40:56.676 --> 40:59.644
Christ, George, what were you thinking?

41:02.481 --> 41:06.151
George. All these years
that we've worked together.

41:06.185 --> 41:09.921
Those were good years, sir.

41:27.339 --> 41:29.472
Constable George Crabtree,

41:29.507 --> 41:31.641
you are under arrest for the murder

41:31.676 --> 41:34.477
of Sergeant Archibald Brooks.
