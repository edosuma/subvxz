First of all, I'd like

03:43.257 --> 03:45.591
for the choice to all wear
wedding dresses.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.392
Just beautiful.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.228
And I mean, we all know
who's getting married,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.763
so that was not confusing
at all. Yeah.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.233
Melissa, Todd,

03:54.235 --> 03:57.402
we just heard a beautiful
rendition of your coitus anthem,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.705
"She Drives Me Crazy."

03:59.707 --> 04:02.040
And now, you are
uniting your souls,

04:02.042 --> 04:03.842
much the same way you did
your penis and vagina

04:03.844 --> 04:06.078
so many times
to that beautiful song.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.447
And now,
that song has taken on

04:08.449 --> 04:11.216
a whole new meaning, when
the bride went medically crazy

04:11.218 --> 04:13.085
after killing a man
she did not know.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.220
But that
was the past.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.222
And this is
the future.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.891
(chuckling):
Look how far we've come, huh?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.093
The last six months

04:21.095 --> 04:22.294
have been, by far,

04:22.296 --> 04:24.630
the most interesting
that we've all shared.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.298
A real roller coaster.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.301
So many
powerful moments--

04:29.303 --> 04:32.738
too many to go into detail,
you know. (groans)

04:32.740 --> 04:34.406
And we were all there anyway,
so, you know,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.441
what's the frickin' point,
yeah?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.110
But, uh, bottom line,

04:38.112 --> 04:40.879
we're stronger
than ever. Huh?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.714
Let's get to the vows.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.949
Melissa,

04:43.951 --> 04:45.717
would you like
to go first?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
Todd,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.621
you are my savior.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.090
And I can't wait

04:52.092 --> 04:55.327
to spend the rest
of my life with you.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.361
(softly):
Thank you.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.831
Is that it?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.500
Yeah.
Perfect.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.503

have to go second here, huh?

05:04.505 --> 05:07.572

Great job.

05:07.574 --> 05:10.342

Melissa...

05:10.344 --> 05:12.477
you're my home.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.315
As you all know,

05:16.317 --> 05:18.483
I went through the legal
and spiritual steps

05:18.485 --> 05:21.320
to reclaim my virginity.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.955
Today I wear white

05:23.957 --> 05:25.657
as a symbol

05:25.659 --> 05:27.659
of the three months
of abstinence we observed

05:27.661 --> 05:29.761
as a couple.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.364
And the two months I observed
as an individual.

05:32.366 --> 05:36.301
I stand before you
pure as the driven snow.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.303

05:38.305 --> 05:40.205
drinking in your spirit.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.773
TANDY:
Jasper,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.275
do you have the rings?

05:48.715 --> 05:51.316
Uh, uh, Jasper,
don't you have something

05:51.318 --> 05:54.553
Here are two rings
around the rosie.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.222
Uh, uh, Jasper?

05:57.224 --> 05:59.224
Boom.
(Tandy laughs)

05:59.226 --> 06:03.195

Good job, Jasper.

when somebody...

said she's gonna be my doctor,

I can do about it.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.869

15:59.559 --> 16:01.659
Okay.

on the machine.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.939

16:22.782 --> 16:24.816
Oh, I already asked for
the machine to be turned off,

16:24.818 --> 16:26.017
so that one does not count.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.152
That doesn't prove
smack, Tandy.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.989

Now, before me is a baby doll
baked into Jell-O.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.773

womb structures.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.177

16:59.285 --> 17:00.685

that I'm capable

17:03.857 --> 17:06.057

17:29.182 --> 17:30.214
Okay.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.682

17:56.076 --> 17:57.842

17:57.844 --> 18:00.111
It's a girl.
Okay, now we just

18:00.113 --> 18:02.113

give it a slap on the rump

18:02.115 --> 18:03.848

18:24.137 --> 18:26.104
Wait. A double no to Gail?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.139

19:37.377 --> 19:40.511
and not being able to do
anything about it.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.813
I've never felt more helpless.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.049
And I loved Phil,

19:45.051 --> 19:48.152
but you're the most important
person in my life.

19:48.154 --> 19:51.322
A-And it's gonna be hard to just
sit in there and do nothing.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.058
You won't be doing nothing.

19:55.727 --> 19:59.363
You have the most important
responsibility of all.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.432
You have to hold my hand.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.472
Hey, Mom.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.241
Darling son.

20:10.243 --> 20:14.378
I-I just wanted to say
no hard feelings.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.880
Fine.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.417
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
about the Phil thing.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.319
There was nothing
you could have done.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.088
Nobody could have.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.190
And when it
comes down to it,

20:26.192 --> 20:30.194
I wouldn't want anybody else
to deliver our baby.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.930
Thanks, Tandy.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.236
You know, I can't
do this all alone.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.272
I'm gonna need a good
copilot in there.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.575
Gail, I would be honored
to be your copilot...

20:44.577 --> 20:45.876
I've asked Todd.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.111
Good call, yeah.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.779
I was gonna, uh, suggest that.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.847
(chuckles)

20:52.284 --> 20:54.252
But Todd

20:54.254 --> 20:57.088
is gonna need
a flight attendant.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.224
And that would b-b...

21:00.226 --> 21:01.792
That would be me?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.327
That would be you.

21:05.297 --> 21:08.232
I'll think about it. (sniffs)

21:08.234 --> 21:09.634
Yeah! O-Okay, I'll do it.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.135
I would love to, actually.
(chuckles)

21:11.137 --> 21:13.371
That's great, thank you.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.072
Guys, we have a situation.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.140
What is it?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.709
My water broke.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.778
Oh, farts.
