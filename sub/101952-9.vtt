00:06.863 --> 00:10.186
- [exhales]

00:10.266 --> 00:12.068
Well, that was weird.

00:12.148 --> 00:13.470
- Really weird.
- Mm-hmm.

00:13.550 --> 00:15.271
- Maybe we never
try that again.

00:15.352 --> 00:16.993
- Mm-hmm.

00:17.073 --> 00:19.115
You're the one who
suggested that we...

00:19.195 --> 00:21.037
switch...

00:21.117 --> 00:22.719
to opposite sides of the bed

00:22.799 --> 00:25.121
to see if we liked
the other better,

00:25.201 --> 00:26.963
and I kept waking up confused.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.044
I didn't know where I was.

00:28.124 --> 00:30.447
- Well, I'm sorry, buddy.

00:30.527 --> 00:32.008
You're here

00:32.088 --> 00:33.850
in my bedroom,

00:33.930 --> 00:36.172
stuck with me.

00:36.252 --> 00:38.975
- Lucky me.

00:40.136 --> 00:43.219
- I've really enjoyed
these past few weeks together.

00:43.299 --> 00:45.422
They've made me feel
much closer to you.

00:45.502 --> 00:46.383
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.064
- Hmm.

00:48.144 --> 00:49.786
And there's still so much more
you have to learn.

00:49.866 --> 00:51.267
I mean, there must be
a million things

00:51.347 --> 00:53.790
we don't know about each other.

00:53.870 --> 00:54.951
- There are?

00:55.031 --> 00:56.713
- Well, I bet you
didn't know that

00:56.793 --> 00:59.756
I am a part of an elite
weekly woodworking club.

00:59.836 --> 01:01.798
- Like sawing, and hammering,
and making wood stuff?

01:01.878 --> 01:03.239
- In an elite way.

01:03.319 --> 01:05.562
- Okay.
[laughter]

01:05.642 --> 01:08.725
- What about you,
what are some things about you

01:08.805 --> 01:10.927
that I would not
be able to guess?

01:11.007 --> 01:13.810
- Mm...

01:13.890 --> 01:15.892
Let me think.

01:21.177 --> 01:23.219
Oh, you know how short I am?

01:23.299 --> 01:24.260
Is that a secret?

01:24.340 --> 01:25.542
- No.

01:25.622 --> 01:27.944
Try again.
- No?

01:28.024 --> 01:30.467
Oh.

01:30.547 --> 01:33.069
Today, Mo is taking me to see
a professional medium.

01:33.149 --> 01:34.871
It was his
birthday present to me,

01:34.951 --> 01:36.873
and we're gonna
use it to contact my father.

01:36.953 --> 01:38.955
- I didn't know
you believed in that stuff.

01:39.035 --> 01:41.037
- I'm not sure I do,
but we'll see what happens.

01:41.117 --> 01:43.039
- Just be careful, okay?

01:43.119 --> 01:45.602
My mom was totally scammed
by a shady psychic

01:45.682 --> 01:48.485
after my dad died, and...

01:48.565 --> 01:50.847
they can be
real grief vampires, so.

01:50.927 --> 01:53.450
- [imitating Dracula] Well,
I'll have to bring some garlic

01:53.530 --> 01:55.452
to protect myself.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.734
Mwahahahahaha.

01:57.814 --> 02:01.177
Oh, another secret is I like
to do voices sometimes.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.622
Hey, Mom?

02:05.702 --> 02:07.984
Can I borrow Dad's fancy watch
for the day?

02:08.064 --> 02:10.026
The medium requires
a personal object

02:10.106 --> 02:12.308
to connect to the other side.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

02:12.388 --> 02:14.551
Just don't read the
inscription on the back.

02:14.631 --> 02:17.033
It's kind of
an inside and dirty joke

02:17.113 --> 02:18.475
Do you want
to grab a plate, sweetie?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.917
- No, Mo's actually
waiting for me

02:20.997 --> 02:22.278
and, you know,
maybe so is Dad.

02:22.358 --> 02:23.840
- Well, yeah.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.121
He's probably hanging out
with Elvis and Larry King.

02:25.201 --> 02:26.362
- This was a gift,

02:26.442 --> 02:28.605
so I don't know how
this is gonna go,

02:28.685 --> 02:30.527
but if anyone
has a question for Dad,

02:30.607 --> 02:31.928
let me know.

02:32.008 --> 02:34.010
- Ask him how he feels
about me quitting my job

02:34.090 --> 02:35.011
and if he still loves me.

02:35.091 --> 02:36.773
- You can tell him

02:36.853 --> 02:38.414
that I miss him
every single day,

02:38.495 --> 02:40.216
and, um,

02:40.296 --> 02:42.258
if you could find out what he
did with that rice cooker,

02:42.338 --> 02:44.140
I need it for
a dinner party thing.

02:44.220 --> 02:45.902
- You're having
a dinner party thingy?

02:45.982 --> 02:47.704
- The Millers and the
Blausteins are coming over.

02:47.784 --> 02:49.706
Nothing fancy,
but after your birthday,

02:49.786 --> 02:52.228
I decided maybe it's time
to be social again.

02:52.308 --> 02:54.390
Come on, let's go get you
that watch.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.752
- Hey Zoey,
maybe ask the psychic

02:55.832 --> 02:56.993
if I'll ever feel joy again?

02:57.073 --> 02:59.155
- Ha.

02:59.235 --> 03:01.237
I will, sure.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.961
This is the psychic?

03:05.041 --> 03:06.563
Is she gonna read my mind

03:06.643 --> 03:07.804
or is she gonna
knit me a sweater?

03:07.884 --> 03:10.246
- She's done both for me,
but she's not a psychic.

03:10.326 --> 03:12.529
She prefers the term
"intuitive."

03:12.609 --> 03:14.611
- Who wants fizzy water?

03:14.691 --> 03:16.332
I only have pamplemousse.

03:16.412 --> 03:19.816
- Sounds good, Nova.
I only drink pamplemousse.

03:22.418 --> 03:24.420
- Here you go.

03:26.903 --> 03:29.385
Dead people make me thirsty.

03:37.073 --> 03:39.676
- Oh, that's part
of her process.

03:41.758 --> 03:43.079
- Okay, so how do we do this?

03:43.159 --> 03:44.721
Do I just start talking?

03:44.801 --> 03:47.283
Like, "Hey, Dad,
are you up there listening?

03:47.363 --> 03:49.525
Knock twice
if you can hear me."

03:51.407 --> 03:53.369
- I wish people
would have an open mind

03:53.449 --> 03:55.291
about other people's
special abilities.

03:55.371 --> 03:56.653

04:02.298 --> 04:03.740
Did you bring an item
of your father's?

04:03.820 --> 04:05.622

One or the other.

04:43.299 --> 04:45.541

04:45.622 --> 04:49.105
there is something not right
inside of you.

04:49.185 --> 04:50.907
- That's 'cause
she ain't right.

Wait, not dark, no.

04:56.913 --> 04:58.554
But your dad, uh...

04:58.635 --> 05:00.436
now he's trying to communicate.

05:00.516 --> 05:02.038
Is there any way,

05:02.118 --> 05:03.840
and I know this is probably
not gonna make much sense

05:03.920 --> 05:05.682
to you at first,

05:05.762 --> 05:07.644
but, uh,

05:07.724 --> 05:09.846
did your Dad

05:09.926 --> 05:12.328

But if Simon's gonna look at me
the way that I was just

05:54.370 --> 05:56.012
looking at Nova,
then I'm never telling him

05:56.092 --> 05:58.094
about my powers.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.818

37:56.370 --> 37:58.452
the same song you sang.

37:58.532 --> 38:00.615
Okay, I'm gonna
be haunted by this until--

38:00.695 --> 38:02.336
- Oh, uh...

38:02.416 --> 38:04.138
- Whoop!
My bad.

38:04.218 --> 38:05.219
- Party foul.

38:05.299 --> 38:06.941
- Shots on me, Maggie.

38:07.021 --> 38:08.623
- Max, quick.

38:08.703 --> 38:09.984
Do you have a case
of fizzy water in the back?

38:10.064 --> 38:11.145
- Yeah, of course I do,

38:11.225 --> 38:13.948
though nobody over seven
calls it that.

38:14.028 --> 38:16.911
[jazz music]

38:18.232 --> 38:21.075
- I'm sorry if I offended
you before,

38:21.155 --> 38:23.517
but you told me that
the spirits

38:23.597 --> 38:25.039
gave you an M name,

38:25.119 --> 38:27.081
and I have to know
who's hurting so badly.

38:27.161 --> 38:28.362
It's not my mom,

38:28.442 --> 38:29.804
it's not Max

38:29.884 --> 38:32.166
it's not Mo,
it's not Mackenzie,

38:32.246 --> 38:33.968
it's not Miles...is it Miles?

38:34.048 --> 38:35.329
Where are there
so many M names?

38:35.409 --> 38:37.211
I need to know.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.173
And what if I don't
figure it out

38:39.253 --> 38:40.574
and the song switching
never ends?

38:40.655 --> 38:41.936
- So, let me get this straight,

38:42.016 --> 38:45.099
the only way that you can
identify a sad person

38:45.179 --> 38:47.301
is if they stand
in front of you

38:47.381 --> 38:49.103
singing a sad song

38:49.183 --> 38:50.985
spelling out how sad they are?

38:51.065 --> 38:52.306
- Kind of.

38:52.386 --> 38:55.149
- Hm, despite my incredible
abilities,

38:55.229 --> 38:57.591
I don't get all my info from
the spirits.

38:57.672 --> 38:59.914
A lot of it is connecting
with people.

38:59.994 --> 39:01.956
Looking around.
Reading between the lines.

39:02.036 --> 39:03.157
- I thought I was doing that.

39:03.237 --> 39:04.759
- [scoffs]
- You don't think so?

39:04.839 --> 39:06.761
You think I'm relying
on the songs too much,

39:06.841 --> 39:09.123
needing everybody to telegraph

39:09.203 --> 39:10.965
what they're feeling

39:11.045 --> 39:12.286
with capital letters
and jazz hands.

39:28.703 --> 39:30.144
Oh!

39:30.224 --> 39:31.826
- Are you getting something?

39:31.906 --> 39:33.347
- [chuckles] The M name.

39:33.427 --> 39:34.628
- What?

39:34.709 --> 39:36.951
- M, M, for EM, Emily!
- Oh!

39:37.031 --> 39:39.153
- She has been reaching
out to me all week,

39:39.233 --> 39:42.236
but I wasn't
paying attention, because...

39:42.316 --> 39:45.359
she wasn't singing
a song directly in my face.

39:45.439 --> 39:47.161
- So what you're saying is,
is that ignoring her

39:47.241 --> 39:48.402
is what triggered
the song switching,

39:48.482 --> 39:49.443
so this whole thing
has been your fault

39:49.523 --> 39:50.885
from the very beginning.

39:50.965 --> 39:52.767

said it nicer myself, but--

We can't just rely
on our gifts, okay?

you need to see

40:05.219 --> 40:07.541
is gonna be
right in front of you,
