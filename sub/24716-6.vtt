all kinds of people,

12:15.609 --> 12:17.027

12:17.278 --> 12:19.238
The fact that I have
the record that I have.

12:19.447 --> 12:24.285

means that I know how to do just that.

about Ismet Vukatch?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.593
Oh, really very little.
He used to work here.

-He left to take another job.
-Did he leave on good terms, bad terms?

12:43.929 --> 12:44.930
Oh, totally good terms.

I hope you’re not thinking of Izzy

It turns out he has some prior arrests.

whatever records you have on him.

-We’re lawyers, okay?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.282
Oh, what, you had the day off.

-Why is she doin’ all the talking, faggot?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.832
You want to do something here, Greg?

-Can I buy you a drink?
-I buy my own drinks.

You’re bothering these people.
I gotta ask you leave.

-Right.

33:36.931 --> 33:37.974
You must work cheap.

You can finish your drink,
but then you gotta go.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.812
Or I gotta do, what I gotta do.

33:43.604 --> 33:44.814
You put your hands on me...

33:45.648 --> 33:47.150
and I’m gonna break your arm.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.239
I’m talking to you like a gentleman.

33:54.741 --> 33:59.579
My job is to get you out of this bar.
One way or another, I’m gonna do that.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.484
Good... Andy.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.779
-How you doin’?
-You feeling all right?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.907
With all the dope I got going,
I feel great.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.618
I just wanted to tell you we got the guy.

-Right.

Thanks.

He’s going away for a long time,
this guy.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.586
That’s good.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.713
And you’re gonna walk out of here
like nothing happened.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.884
Yeah, they say... two weeks,
if there’s no infection.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.137
Probably better to hand over
the money if it ever happens again.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.099
Yeah. That’s what I was thinking.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.476
All right.

35:03.976 --> 35:07.230
-You take care, Andy.
-Hey, can I ask you a favor?

35:08.022 --> 35:09.023
Sure.

35:09.190 --> 35:13.653
My phone has all my friends numbers in it.
Some of them might be trying to call me.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.196
I’ll swing by the house and pick it up.

-I’ll be back in an hour.

Eighteen.

is it gonna go through?

36:35.067 --> 36:36.068
Try it.

36:49.123 --> 36:52.084
Look, if I’m not dreaming,
what are you doing here?

36:52.210 --> 36:54.253
-You called me.
-No, no, I didn’t call you.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.088
No, you just showed up
in that hospital bed.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.965
You gave me a hell of a scare,
let me tell you.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.717
No, that wasn’t me.
That was your imagination

would they see you?

37:07.433 --> 37:08.434
No.

standing here talking to yourself.

I’m standing here talking to a ghost.

-Clark’s a grown man.
-Who lost one father

and scared to death
he’s gonna lose another one.

-I can’t take that on.
-You already did.

-and you. I can’t go through that again.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.331

and you won’t have to.

he was right there for you.

Yes, Andy, that’s exactly what I’m saying.

It’d be nice if he gave me the high sign
once in a while.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.862
