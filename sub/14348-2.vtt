WEBVTT

00:05.538 --> 00:08.006
Hey.
What are you doing?

00:08.041 --> 00:12.045
What's it look like
I'm doin'? Come on, man.

00:12.545 --> 00:16.049
This is like the seventh ticket
I've gotten in the last 10 days.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.052
Didn't you take a look at the
plaque? I'm F.D.N.Y. I'm on the job.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.519
Not my job.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.057
Come on, man.
I got two brothers who are cops.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.061
- Yeah, I got a cousin who's a fireman.
- Oh, really? What's his name?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.295
Joe.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.167
Look, we should stick together. We're
two Irish guys. We're a dying breed.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.403
- I'm Jewish.
- Huh?

00:36.636 --> 00:38.370
I'm a Jew.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.472
It's funny.
You look Irish. I just--

00:40.507 --> 00:43.243
You know the difference between
Irish guilt and Jewish guilt?

00:43.278 --> 00:45.512
- What?
- Whiskey.

00:47.847 --> 00:52.352
Look, man, you know. I've been on the job
20 years. I lost, like, 60 guys on 9/11.

00:52.387 --> 00:55.220
9/11 was four years
ago, champ.

00:55.255 --> 00:59.592
Deal with it. You had your day.
They wrote books about you guys.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.429
They put you up on a
pedestal, and what happened?

01:02.464 --> 01:04.431
It turns out you
ain't just heroes.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.433
Turns out some of youse do
blow and have gang bangs.

01:07.468 --> 01:11.087
Turns out some of youse are
just broken-down drunks...

01:11.122 --> 01:14.416
on the verge of a complete
and total mental collapse.

01:14.451 --> 01:17.710
America don't like it when
things get complicated, pal.

01:22.949 --> 01:26.786
Asshole. Shoot.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.291
Damn it.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.598
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

01:40.633 --> 01:43.937
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

01:43.972 --> 01:46.738
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

01:46.773 --> 01:50.143
Things were good
when we were young

01:50.510 --> 01:53.663
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

01:53.698 --> 01:56.816
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

01:56.851 --> 02:00.285
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

02:00.320 --> 02:03.489
Things were good
when we were young

02:03.524 --> 02:06.624
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

02:06.659 --> 02:09.912
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

02:09.947 --> 02:13.225
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

02:13.260 --> 02:16.503
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

02:21.007 --> 02:23.475
I don't want him here.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.512
I know you don't, but he's the best
firefighter I've ever worked with.

02:25.547 --> 02:27.912
- We need the guy.
- Like a hole in the head.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.915
We got plenty of talent on the crew,
but nobody with guts like Tommy.

02:30.950 --> 02:35.855
- Gavin's got guts. He's also got a big goddamn mouth.
- He quit drinking.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.089
Since when?
Since two days ago.

02:38.124 --> 02:41.326
- Two whole days?
- Nobody said Tommy was perfect.

02:41.361 --> 02:45.365
- Everybody makes mistakes.
- And I'd be making one if I let his ass back in here.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.885
It's not gonna happen, fellas.
Save your breath.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.370
- Goddamn it, Ron.
- I said it's not gonna happen.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.212
Hey.
Little catnap, huh?

02:59.712 --> 03:02.180
Jesus, man, I--

03:02.215 --> 03:04.682
I haven't read this much
since high school, man.

03:04.717 --> 03:08.555
Actually, I never read a book in
high school. That's how bad this is.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.823
What is it? Is it 'cause we're on
an island? We're surrounded by water?

03:10.858 --> 03:14.394
- There's no fires. What's going on?
- It's been a little slow.

03:14.429 --> 03:16.361
Yeah.
Hey, guys.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.630
I drive an hour and a half,
two hours to get here.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.234
I sleep for 3 hours, and then I
drive home two and a half hours.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.069
It's crazy.
You could take the ferry.

03:23.104 --> 03:25.071
- Do me a favor.
- What?

03:25.572 --> 03:27.907
If you ever see me on the ferry,
shoot me in the goddamn head. Okay?

03:28.141 --> 03:31.678
Tom, look, I know it doesn't
compare to what you saw in the city.

03:31.945 --> 03:35.515
- But we do get some action.
- Big supermarket burned about half a mile from here.

03:35.550 --> 03:38.585
- When?
- I was in junior high.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.755
- Did you ask him?
- No.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.592
- What?
- You sing?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.226
Huh?

03:48.261 --> 03:50.495
Do you-- Have you ever sung?

03:50.530 --> 03:54.367
- You know, like songs.
- If you can carry a tune, you'd really be helping us out.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.235
- It's for the nationals.
- What are you guys talking about?

03:57.270 --> 04:00.440
- The firefighter barbershop quartet nationals.
- Yeah, it's a huge deal.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.574
Our quartet's been in it
the last four years running.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.076
- We're called the Smoketeers. - It
was supposed to be the Smoke-Eaters,

04:05.111 --> 04:08.114
but people pronounced it the other way
so much, we finally figured what the hell.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.350
We thought we had a solid chance this
year. But then our lead singer, Bill Kelly--

04:11.385 --> 04:14.220
- Works the other shift. Great voice, perfect pitch.
- Got into a goddamn bar fight.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.754
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

04:16.789 --> 04:20.091
He got punched in the throat.
Now he can't sing.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.295
Competition's two days away.
We're really scrambling.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.596
- We're doing "Coney Island Baby."
- Among others.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.134
You'd be singing the lead part on that,
so you'd only have to know the melody.

04:28.169 --> 04:30.201
It's easy. No harmony.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.705
All right,
I'm gonna go upstairs...

04:33.740 --> 04:37.744
and leave you three guys alone so you
can all blow each other, all right?

04:39.145 --> 04:41.147
Wow.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.817
Another day, another 27
cents. We got a raise?

04:45.318 --> 04:46.819
How's Jeannie doing?

04:47.320 --> 04:48.821
Good.
Ah, pretty good.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.289
She starts to lose a step
by the end of the day,

04:51.324 --> 04:53.826
but late morning, early afternoon,
it's as if nothing changed.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.329
Tell her I'm thinking
about her?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.331
Thanks, Kenny.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.801
Yeah?
Hey, it's me.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.803
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm doing great.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.805
Took me an hour and 15 to get
over the Verrazano this morning.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.843
I'd blow the goddamn thing up if I didn't
think the terrorists would take credit for it.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.811
Any luck with Janet and the kids? No.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.115
My brother's on it, my cousin's
on it. You'll find them.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.851
- Yeah. What do you got for me?
- Nothing yet.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.121
- Jesus, Lou.
- We talked to Perrolli.

05:21.156 --> 05:23.507
And? And it's gonna be a tough sell.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.858
But we're working on it.
Asshole.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.627
He's got the market
cornered on that.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.030
- What about the new guy? Any chance of getting rid of him?
- I doubt it.

05:31.431 --> 05:35.468
I happen to think the guy's a phony, but
everyone else seems to have taken a shine.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.471
He's like a chick. He can
talk to anybody about anything.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.973
I totally think your bangs
are the right length.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.941
You don't think it makes
my face look too square? No.

05:43.976 --> 05:47.012
Have you ever thought about
getting the Dorothy Hamill thing?

05:47.047 --> 05:50.014
I have totally thought about
getting the Dorothy Hamill thing.

05:50.049 --> 05:53.886
Okay, but wait. You don't think
that would make me look too dykey?

05:54.287 --> 05:57.223
You could never look dykey.
Oh, Sully.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.726
And the guy can cook anything.
He's like some freak in the kitchen.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.194
Salmon cake
with a cream dill sauce.

06:03.229 --> 06:07.233
Pork tenderloin, homemade apple sauce
and brussels sprouts roasted in olive oil.

06:07.268 --> 06:10.570
Flank steak with a port wine
reduction and haricot vert.

06:10.605 --> 06:12.405
Haricot vert?
What the hell's that?

06:12.905 --> 06:15.908
I don't know. It sure as shit
looked like green beans to me.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.377
We're never gonna lose this
guy. Well, it gets worse.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.713
He's part owner of this paintball
course out on the Island.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.518
He took the whole crew there a
couple weeks ago. They had a blast.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.318
Shit. So what's the plan?

06:27.353 --> 06:30.555
Jerry said he was gonna make some phone
calls, maybe go over Perrolli's head.

06:30.590 --> 06:35.595
You guys gotta do something. I'm losing
my mind out here. You know, Staten Island--

06:35.995 --> 06:38.030
The other night, one of the guys on
the crew lit two matches by mistake.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.067
It was the biggest fire those
guys have ever seen. Swear to God.

06:41.102 --> 06:43.603
Hey, where are you? You wanna
get a cup of coffee or something?

06:43.638 --> 06:47.207
No. I'm late for my meeting.
I'll call you tomorrow.

06:47.242 --> 06:50.777
- We'll think of something.
- Thanks.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.115
Liar. You did not.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.118
Mike, what are you
doing here?

06:59.153 --> 07:01.888
Surprised?
Yeah.

07:01.923 --> 07:04.589
Can I come in?
Um--

07:04.624 --> 07:08.628
You could. I'm not sure how
comfortable everybody would be.

07:08.663 --> 07:10.630
Everybody?

07:12.632 --> 07:15.067
Walt's here.
Who's Walt?

07:15.535 --> 07:18.805
My friend. I thought we talked
about this. What do you mean?

07:19.172 --> 07:22.141
That I was probably gonna start
seeing Walt. Didn't we talk about that?

07:22.542 --> 07:27.480
I guess I didn't... exactly
get what you were saying.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.316
Well, that's the problem
right there, isn't it?

07:32.151 --> 07:34.086
So, you're dumping me?

07:35.922 --> 07:39.390
Look, we had a good time.
I think we enjoyed each other.

07:39.425 --> 07:43.429
But this lasted as long as it was
gonna last. You're making a big mistake.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.532
I'm a good-looking guy.
I'm in great shape.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.168
I'm a New York City
firefighter, Theresa!

07:49.203 --> 07:51.170
I can get any
goddamn girl I want!

07:51.205 --> 07:53.673
Then you should do that.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.751 --> 08:09.153
Oh, man. Yeah?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.857
- Tommy, it's Teddy. How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.492
Stuck in bumper-to-bumper
traffic for the last half hour.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.329
You heard from your old man? He's
still in Ireland as far as I know.

08:17.364 --> 08:20.132
No, he's not. You haven't been
getting the postcards, have you?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.134
My mail's all screwed up.
I moved.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.836
First it was Ireland,
then France, then Germany.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.873
He sent me a picture of him
standing on the Great Wall!

08:26.908 --> 08:29.841
- Of China?
- No, Peru.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.211
Of course China!
How many Great Walls are there?

08:32.578 --> 08:36.381
There's only one. That's why
it's great. Hold on a second.

08:36.883 --> 08:40.219
And making a move outside is--
Come on, 73! Come on!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.822
- Come on, you filthy whore!
- Teddy?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.491
- Surfs takes it by a length.
- Oh, shit!

08:47.393 --> 08:49.694
Hi.

08:49.729 --> 08:53.332
Where is he getting the cabbage to do
all this traveling? That's the thing.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.570
I just got a letter today, and inside there
was a picture with him and some Chink broad.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.757
I don't wanna start any rumors,
but it looks like he's her boy toy.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.910
You know what, Teddy? He's too
old to be considered a boy toy,

09:04.410 --> 09:06.746
even by Bette Davis, who's
been dead for, like, 10 years.

09:06.781 --> 09:10.548
Okay?
You got any money?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.085
What? I owe some major
cash to some people.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.720
Jesus, Teddy. Goddamn.

09:15.755 --> 09:19.091
I'm starting to sweat a little.
Anything you can do to help me?

09:19.458 --> 09:22.094
- How much do you need?
- 26,000.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.830
I'm sorry.
Who is this again?

09:25.865 --> 09:29.602
Look, I gotta go. I'll call
you later when it's safe.

09:39.111 --> 09:43.581
Hey. She went down a little after 8:15.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.368
She's getting easier. I only
had to read her two stories.

09:46.403 --> 09:49.121
No belly button song? Of
course the belly button song.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.089
That's a given.
How was physical therapy?

09:52.124 --> 09:55.593
A blast as always. Can I give
you some money? Oh, please don't.

09:55.628 --> 10:00.466
I don't wanna cheapen this whole
babysitting thing we've got going.

10:00.501 --> 10:02.736
Have a good night.

10:02.771 --> 10:04.872
What are you doing?

10:04.907 --> 10:06.973
Going with the moment.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.441
I don't think so.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.980
What? It gets better
the closer you come.

10:14.015 --> 10:16.983
Ah, Franco, don't.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.951
Hey, look, I have to show
you my appreciation, okay?

10:19.986 --> 10:23.990
You've been so good to me and Keela, I
think it's time that I be good to you.

10:24.025 --> 10:26.457
Can I tell you how
this is gonna go?

10:26.492 --> 10:30.461
Yeah, please. I love a
woman who takes control.

10:30.496 --> 10:34.500
You'll be really cute and really
funny and really handsome...

10:34.535 --> 10:36.467
and make great faces
until I sleep with you,

10:36.502 --> 10:40.006
which I eventually will,
because you're a total stud...

10:40.041 --> 10:43.509
and I'm as unlaid
as a pile of bricks.

10:43.544 --> 10:45.476
Sounds good so far.

10:45.511 --> 10:49.015
But then I'll want more out
of the relationship eventually.

10:49.050 --> 10:52.018
You know, with me
being the woman and all.

10:52.053 --> 10:54.520
And I'm so goddamn good
in the sack,

10:55.021 --> 10:58.524
you'll actually try and commit for
the first time in your whole life.

10:58.559 --> 11:02.528
You'll change for me, Franco,
but then you'll resent me,

11:02.563 --> 11:04.495
and then I'll resent you
for resenting me.

11:04.530 --> 11:08.034
And pretty soon we won't be able to stand
being in the same room as each other,

11:08.534 --> 11:11.002
never mind forcing
our body parts to intersect.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.874
But we have to be in the same
room because we work together.

11:14.909 --> 11:18.645
So, unless one of us
dies in a fire...

11:18.680 --> 11:22.381
or moves away
or kills the other one,

11:22.882 --> 11:26.385
we'll constantly be forced to remember
the horrific, bloody train wreck...

11:26.886 --> 11:30.890
of a relationship that started
with your hand on my coat.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.728
But it's your move, stud.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.400
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.906
Smart man.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.743
It's after 11:00, Tommy.

11:51.243 --> 11:54.496
Yeah, I know. I got caught up
at something and, you know--

11:54.531 --> 11:57.558
You couldn't call me? I was
gonna call, then I just figured--

11:57.593 --> 12:00.586
You figured that I'd be
waiting up for you, which I was.

12:00.621 --> 12:03.089
Let's not make a big
giant thing out of this.

12:03.124 --> 12:05.056
I'm going to bed.

12:05.091 --> 12:09.261
I got you some chicken
soup... for the baby.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.597
For the baby?

12:12.098 --> 12:15.566
I think that's the first time
you've ever used the word "baby."

12:15.601 --> 12:18.903
No, it's not. What are you talking
about? I use "baby" all the time.

12:18.938 --> 12:23.275
No, no, no. No! Usually you just point
to my stomach and ask, "How's it going?"

12:25.277 --> 12:27.244
How is it going?

12:27.279 --> 12:31.533
My stomach's a little off.
Actually, I don't feel good.

12:31.568 --> 12:35.788
So sex is out of the question.
You might as well go home.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.790
I quit drinking.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.591
What?

12:40.626 --> 12:45.096
I quit drinking. I was at a
meeting. That's why I was late.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.634
I just thought I'm running so late I
might as well just go straight over there.

12:48.669 --> 12:51.971
You quit drinking?
Yeah.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.306
Three days ago.

12:57.309 --> 13:00.229
Yeah, so, you know,
I was just kind of shaky,

13:00.264 --> 13:03.149
so I didn't want to be
alone tonight, you know?

13:03.184 --> 13:06.986
You quit for us--
for me and the baby?

13:07.021 --> 13:08.988
Yeah, yeah.

13:12.992 --> 13:17.997
So, is a blow job
out of the question or--

13:20.499 --> 13:22.501
I was kidding.

13:24.336 --> 13:28.340
Sheil. Sheila?

13:29.775 --> 13:32.743
You bastard!

13:32.778 --> 13:35.781
You goddamn cheating bastard!

13:36.282 --> 13:38.851
Jeannie, for Christ sakes,
what the hell are you doing?

13:39.351 --> 13:42.319
I'm your wife.
How could you?

13:42.354 --> 13:44.356
Do what?
What are you talking about?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.126
Helen Bradley!
My best friend!

13:47.161 --> 13:49.827
I know what
you're doing with her!

13:49.862 --> 13:53.615
Helen Bradley. She moved
out of state 20 years ago.

13:53.650 --> 13:57.334
What the hell are you
talking about? You bastard!

13:57.369 --> 14:00.372
Jeannie, if you hit me one
more time for Christ sakes--

14:10.716 --> 14:13.184
Trouble

14:13.219 --> 14:18.724
Oh, trouble, trouble
trouble, trouble

14:19.225 --> 14:22.144
Feels like every time
I get back on my feet

14:22.179 --> 14:25.064
She come around
and knock me down again

14:27.066 --> 14:30.034
Worry

14:30.069 --> 14:35.074
Oh, worry, worry
worry, worry

14:35.574 --> 14:39.078
Sometimes I swear it feels
like this worry

14:39.578 --> 14:42.046
Is my only friend

14:42.081 --> 14:46.085
Well, I've been saved

14:46.120 --> 14:48.587
By a woman

14:50.089 --> 14:53.342
I've been saved

14:53.377 --> 14:56.595
By a woman

14:58.931 --> 15:02.601
I've been saved

15:02.636 --> 15:06.272
By a woman

15:06.772 --> 15:10.776
She won't let me go

15:11.277 --> 15:13.279
She won't let me go
Sheil?

15:15.781 --> 15:18.700
She won't let me go

15:18.735 --> 15:21.620
She won't let me go

15:24.790 --> 15:27.559
Whoa

15:29.461 --> 15:31.463
Ah

15:34.466 --> 15:37.970
She won't let me go

15:38.971 --> 15:41.473
She won't let me go

15:42.975 --> 15:45.978
She won't let me go

15:47.479 --> 15:49.315
She won't let me go

15:53.319 --> 15:54.820
Whoa

15:56.655 --> 15:58.490
Ah

16:00.993 --> 16:03.495
Whoa
Hey, it's me.

16:03.996 --> 16:06.964
Yeah, I know it's early.
I want to talk to you.

16:06.999 --> 16:10.936
Who do you think you are,
dumping me? No, let me talk.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.904
You don't dump me.
I dump you.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.942
I dump you
'cause I'm the man, baby,

16:17.443 --> 16:20.062
and you're a fat,
disgusting bitch...

16:20.097 --> 16:22.681
who's never gonna get
laid good again!

16:23.182 --> 16:25.649
Laid well again. Laid good
again. That's not the point!

16:25.684 --> 16:29.188
The point is you're a fat pig, and I
only did you because I felt sorry for you!

16:29.688 --> 16:33.157
Go to hell, bitch!

16:33.192 --> 16:36.528
Come on. Come on.
Pick up. Pick up.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.495
Yeah?
Mick, you up?

16:38.530 --> 16:41.533
I am now.
A little early, isn't it?

16:42.034 --> 16:45.537
You're my sponsor. You're supposed
to be available to me 24/7, right?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.941
I'm honored.
What do you want?

16:48.976 --> 16:52.311
I feel like having a drink.
Don't.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.230
It's like I can hear voices
in my head.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.848
I got this thirst
coming on me, man.

16:57.883 --> 17:02.353
I just really wanna pull over and
have a couple of drinks. Don't do it.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.723
This is what you got for me? I'm calling you
up telling you I'm on the verge of drinking,

17:05.759 --> 17:09.228
and you're telling me don't do
it like some reverse Nike ad?

17:09.728 --> 17:11.997
Go ahead and take
a drink, you pussy.

17:12.263 --> 17:14.750
Great. Some sponsor.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.201
Man!

17:17.236 --> 17:21.240
You know what? I gotta call
you back. All right? Asshole.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.575
Unbelievable.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.809
Daddy?
Colleen?

17:25.844 --> 17:28.545
Hi.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.582
Hang on. I gotta pull over. Hang on.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.886
Yeah, yeah.
Eat me, asshole.

17:35.921 --> 17:40.592
No, I wasn't talking to you, honey.
Just some guy. Is something wrong?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.928
I stole Mom's cell phone. She
doesn't know I'm calling you.

17:43.295 --> 17:46.230
- Where are you?
- This sucks so bad.

17:46.265 --> 17:49.268
We live in a shitty little house,
half our stuff isn't unpacked.

17:49.303 --> 17:52.771
I understand. I understand.
But where are you?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.773
I miss you, Daddy.

17:55.274 --> 17:59.743
I miss you too, okay?
Now tell me where you are.

17:59.778 --> 18:03.715
You can't ever tell Mom I told you.
She'll kill me. I won't tell her anything.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.286
- We're in London.
- Jesus, England?

18:07.653 --> 18:11.223
London, Ohio.
It's near Columbus.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.959
Can you come get us,
Daddy?

18:15.461 --> 18:19.298
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
All right.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.902
Tommy, I'd like to help you out,
but we're stretched as it is.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.622
I already got three guys
out sick with the flu.

18:26.657 --> 18:29.273
Chief, I'm gonna be gone
one day, two days tops.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.275
My hands are tied. It's not
like you need me around here.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.313
Biggest call we got in the last few weeks
was that old lady reporting a gas leak.

18:34.348 --> 18:36.982
Ended up that she was the
"leakee." Come on, Chief.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.450
Suppose there's a fire.

18:39.485 --> 18:43.454
- Suppose an asteroid hits the Earth.
- Tom, I can't take the risk.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.492
The only guys getting any time off
in this house until further notice...

18:46.527 --> 18:48.327
are the guys doing the
barbershop thing in Ohio.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.627
What thing in Ohio?

18:50.662 --> 18:52.998
You know, that barbershop
quartet competition.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.299
Huh.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.170
I thought you didn't sing.
Who said I didn't sing?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.137
Did you ever hear me say
I didn't sing?

19:00.172 --> 19:03.675
Twelve years of Catholic school. It's
like being in prison. All we did was sing.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.678
The nuns loved my voice. They
said I sounded like an angel.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.646
- What part did you sing?
- Huh?

19:09.681 --> 19:13.352
- Bass, baritone, tenor?
- Uh, I sang all the parts.

19:13.387 --> 19:15.319
I was like
a designated singer.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.321
Whatever parts they
needed sung, I sang.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.359
You should've told us that before.
We already got somebody. Who?

19:20.859 --> 19:22.694
Carmine. Carmine can barely
talk, never mind sing.

19:23.061 --> 19:26.798
Jesus, Carmine. Carmine's voice
ain't that great. He's flat a lot.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.536
He knows all our songs. The kid--
he's like a gofer for the quartet.

19:30.571 --> 19:33.504
When we do a gig--
Nursing homes. Hospitals.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.541
He comes along, sets things up,
takes care of the equipment.

19:35.576 --> 19:38.509
What equipment? Okay, so
it's not a lot of equipment.

19:38.544 --> 19:42.047
- But we told him if we ever had an opening, he was in.
- He does know the songs.

19:42.082 --> 19:44.883
Right. Guys, we're not talking about...

19:45.384 --> 19:47.886
going to some nursing home and singing
for people who have no teeth left.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.222
This is the big event.
This is the big show.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.357
It's the nationals.
It's for the trophy.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.994
I'm not sure there is a trophy.
We've never come close to winning.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.729
Well, whatever.
It's for bragging rights.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.483
Not that you really wanna
brag about something like this.

20:01.518 --> 20:04.701
I got the voice you need.
Can you sing something for us?

20:04.736 --> 20:08.240
What do you mean? We gotta get
an idea of what you sound like.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.541
- To see if you mesh with the group.
- Right.

20:10.576 --> 20:14.580
I can mesh. I'm the king of meshing.
Nickname in high school was Mesh.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.015
Tom, can you just
sing something for us?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.383
Now?
Yeah.

20:19.418 --> 20:23.355
- I'm not really warmed up.
Something, anything.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.425
- Yeah. "Silent Night."
- I like that song.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.226
Um--
All right.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.763
All right. I mean, I'm
not, you know-- Go ahead.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.936
All right, you know-- Um--

20:40.939 --> 20:45.110
Silent night

20:45.145 --> 20:49.246
Holy night

20:49.281 --> 20:52.117
All is calm

20:56.121 --> 20:59.625
Round yon virgin

21:02.628 --> 21:04.630
Child

21:05.130 --> 21:06.898
What do you think?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.433
What?
Nice.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.803
It's okay.
It needs a little work.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.439
Needs a lot of work.
- No, that was great, Tommy.

21:15.474 --> 21:19.478
Thanks, Paulie. Paulie knows. He's
got perfect pitch. Thanks, pal.

21:19.513 --> 21:22.546
You're in.
Great. When do we leave?

21:22.581 --> 21:25.700
Soon as the shift's over. We're gonna
take my S.U.V. Take us about seven hours.

21:25.735 --> 21:28.820
But I figure we can use the time to
rehearse. Now, you can read music, right?

21:28.855 --> 21:31.089
What do you think?

21:32.691 --> 21:35.093
- You really think he's ready?
- I'm ready, asshole.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.496
Yeah, Carmine, come on
over here and let's talk.

21:37.531 --> 21:40.797
Yeah, take a walk.

21:40.832 --> 21:44.770
Show business.
- Yep, it's a bitch.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.008
Hey, Kenny.
Hey. Hey, look at you.

21:50.509 --> 21:55.013
Next time you try banging the cat, put little
booties over its claws so it can't scratch.

21:55.048 --> 21:58.350
- That's what I do.
- You like this, huh?

21:58.385 --> 22:00.317
More fun and games
with the wife.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.819
I wake up last night, she's
beating the shit out of me.

22:02.854 --> 22:06.358
Any reason? She says because
I was screwing her best friend.

22:06.393 --> 22:10.862
Oh, man. She's really
starting to slip, huh? Yeah.

22:11.363 --> 22:15.367
Are you screwing her friend?
Jesus, Kenny! My wife is sick.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.370
You think I'm gonna go out and look for something
on the side? Is that what you think of me?

22:18.405 --> 22:20.372
I'm sorry.
Jesus!

22:21.873 --> 22:24.375
I screwed the friend
30 years ago.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.562
There we go.
She left for three weeks.

22:26.597 --> 22:28.714
She said she had to go
find herself.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.181
Got stuck taking care
of the kid by myself.

22:31.216 --> 22:35.721
This is ancient history. It all
comes back to her last night? Amazing.

22:36.221 --> 22:40.691
The doctor said with this Alzheimer's
thing, life is like a deck of cards.

22:40.726 --> 22:44.062
You got a full deck. You just can't
control the shuffle. Hey, guys.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.898
Morning. Hey, how you doing,
kid? How's the shoulder?

22:46.933 --> 22:49.366
It's pretty good.
Almost 100%.

22:49.401 --> 22:53.171
I was wondering, you guys know anyplace
around here where I can get this refilled?

22:53.206 --> 22:55.872
- Vicodin. Party time.
- Yeah.

22:55.907 --> 22:59.344
I don't really need it. It's just
the pain flares up a little bit.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.413
Well, you can't.
This has been refilled twice.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.047
So? You need a new prescription.

23:04.082 --> 23:07.252
You gotta go back to your doctor or go visit
the voodoo boys down at the medical office.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.756
They got this stuff? Nothing that good,
but they'll give you something close.

23:10.791 --> 23:14.694
- Just remember to share with the class.
- You know me. Thanks.

23:14.729 --> 23:18.081
Hey, Franco, I don't know how
you feel about Tommy these days,

23:18.116 --> 23:21.433
but we're trying to make a move
to get him back into the house.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.735
- The guy almost got me killed, Chief.
- I'm aware of that, Franco.

23:24.770 --> 23:28.874
You should be, seeing as how I distinctly
remember telling you it was gonna happen.

23:29.174 --> 23:32.210
Now I got this because of him. I got a bad
shoulder. I got three months of goddamn pain--

23:32.245 --> 23:35.113
- Franco, he just wants to talk to you.
- About what?

23:35.480 --> 23:37.616
- Will you sit down with him?
- I'll think about it.

23:38.116 --> 23:41.620
Good morning, boys. Sully's famous
banana bread! Come and get it.

23:41.655 --> 23:44.588
Prick.
Yeah.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.793
But it is banana bread.

23:47.828 --> 23:50.295
Hi.
Hey.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.763
How's it going?
Good.

23:52.798 --> 23:57.302
Yeah? How's it-- How's it
going with what's her name?

23:57.337 --> 23:59.805
Who?
You know.

24:01.306 --> 24:04.775
Oh. I dumped her.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.777
Really?
Yeah, yesterday.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.279
Hey, finally! Nice work. Right here.

24:09.314 --> 24:12.317
Thanks, bro. I gotta tell you,
I didn't understand that at all.

24:12.352 --> 24:15.320
It's like you'd gone completely
mental or something. Yeah, it was.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.288
But you're back now, huh?
Another one, right here.

24:18.323 --> 24:23.829
In that case, listen. I met this
chick the other night at a health club.

24:23.864 --> 24:27.165
She teaches like spinning, whatever
that is. Anyway, smoking body.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.668
Sounds good.
Well, she's mine.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.420
But she's got this friend
who really digs firemen,

24:32.455 --> 24:34.638
and she said if I could
get her friend a date,

24:34.673 --> 24:38.176
it would help move things
along for us to the next stage.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.644
What's the next stage?
The blow job stage.

24:40.679 --> 24:43.014
- Oh, I like that stage.
- It's the best stage.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.315
Anyway, Franco wouldn't do it.
He's hung up on...

24:45.350 --> 24:47.651
the whole scar on the neck,
Phantom of the Opera thing.

24:47.686 --> 24:50.622
But it doesn't matter 'cause I
got you, right? I'm gonna call her.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.358
- You good for tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good, bro.

24:53.393 --> 24:55.861
Hang on.
I gotta call her.

24:56.361 --> 24:59.996
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

25:00.031 --> 25:04.369
You got everything? We got
everything-- jackets, hats, pitch pipe.

25:04.404 --> 25:08.206
This is gonna be great.
I already called shotgun.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.675
Get away from the door.

25:11.710 --> 25:14.177
Hey, hey.
No smoking in the truck.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.715
Yeah, that's gonna work.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.219
Yeah?
Hi, sweetie.

25:21.586 --> 25:24.389
Listen, I can't really
talk right now, okay?

25:24.890 --> 25:28.393
Listen, the "dittle" baby
wants his big daddy...

25:28.428 --> 25:30.360
to bring some more soupy.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.898
Do you think that big daddy
can bring some more soupy-woupy?

25:32.933 --> 25:35.365
That better be the baby
talking, because if it's you,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.903
big daddy's gonna come home and
punch you right in the face, okay?

25:37.938 --> 25:40.136
I'd like to see you try.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.407
Honey, I really gotta go.
I gotta keep this line free.

25:42.442 --> 25:44.374
See? Gotta go.

25:44.409 --> 25:47.679
- Wait. When are you coming over? I'm very upset.
- Sheil.

25:47.946 --> 25:50.432
One of my asshole neighbors
threw a liquor bottle...

25:50.467 --> 25:52.918
at my statue of the Blessed
Virgin in the backyard.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.385
People are very sick!
Bye-bye.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.387
Oh, no, no!
Hey, Johnny, how's it going?

25:57.422 --> 26:01.426
Tommy, you talk to Uncle Teddy
lately? We talked yesterday. Why?

26:01.927 --> 26:05.430
Some of his boys saw some guys push
him into a car outside the O.T.B.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.533
Shit. He told me he owed
somebody a boatload of cabbage.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.269
Something sounds really wrong.
I'm gonna look into it.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.737
Okay. Listen, I got a line
on Janet and the kids.

26:13.772 --> 26:17.108
Colleen called. They're in Ohio,
and I'm leaving right now.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.878
Johnny? That's great,
Tommy. I gotta run.

26:20.145 --> 26:23.114
But I-- Asshole.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.117
Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

26:26.518 --> 26:30.956
- This is gonna be exciting.
- I'm coming in my pants as we speak.

26:36.461 --> 26:38.463
Guys?

26:43.802 --> 26:46.972
I miss you most

26:47.007 --> 26:50.242
Of all

26:50.277 --> 26:53.443
All

26:53.478 --> 26:56.481
Sounds pretty good. We got five hours.
I think we could pull it all together.

26:56.848 --> 26:59.818
Nah, we don't wanna peak too
early. I think it sounds fine.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.118
Tommy's a little flat.

27:02.153 --> 27:03.954
Who asked you, equipment boy?

27:03.989 --> 27:06.324
- Let's just do it again, guys. Come on.
- Yeah?

27:06.725 --> 27:09.260
What took you so long
to get back to me?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.663
Where are you?
Write this down.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.797
Quick! Come on.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.667
Where you going?
I told you it's personal.

27:16.167 --> 27:19.170
Please tell me this thing's got gas in
it. What's it get, 20 feet to the gallon?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.507
- We need you here, Tommy.
- I'm gonna be back in plenty of time, Sal.

27:22.542 --> 27:25.976
- Don't worry about it.
- Fine! Go! Who gives a shit?

27:26.011 --> 27:29.014
Hey, Sal. It's not like we had
a chance in hell anyway. We blow.

27:29.049 --> 27:31.850
We don't blow. You're
not even in the group.

27:32.083 --> 27:36.688
You know what's gonna happen. Same as the
last four years. The winners never change.

27:36.723 --> 27:40.323
The Five Alarm Four from Denver,
Mrs. O'Leary's Cowboys from Chicago,

27:40.358 --> 27:43.528
the Red Hot Papas from Kansas City--
they're gonna wipe the stage with us!

27:43.563 --> 27:46.830
Maybe it's our name.
Shut up.

27:46.865 --> 27:51.870
No, fellas. I've been thinking.
How 'bout this? The Pole Smokers.

27:51.905 --> 27:56.374
Like we come down the pole
so fast, we're smoking.

27:56.608 --> 28:00.510
- Jesus.
- What are you guys doing, huh?

28:00.545 --> 28:05.383
Take a look at yourselves. Standing in a hotel
parking lot, looking like a bunch of losers.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.519
Come on. Stand up straight.
Where are we from?

28:09.554 --> 28:11.890
New York, right? The greatest
city on the planet Earth.

28:12.257 --> 28:13.690
Right.
And who do we represent?

28:13.725 --> 28:17.662
-Greatest fire department in the history of fire departments.
-That's right.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.664
That's right.
So let's act like it. Huh?

28:19.931 --> 28:22.699
- Yeah. - We can kick these
guys asses at anything--

28:22.734 --> 28:27.238
football, hockey, even some
pussy thing like singing, correct?

28:27.273 --> 28:29.539
That's right. F.D.N.Y.

28:29.574 --> 28:34.179
F.D.N.Y.! F.D.N.Y.!
F.D.N.Y.!

28:34.214 --> 28:36.880
F.D.N.Y.! F.D.N.Y.!

28:36.915 --> 28:40.251
F.D.N.Y.! If I don't make it
back in time, kid, you're up.

28:58.937 --> 29:02.774
Garrity, take the probie, go to the top
floor, work your way down, and make a search.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.878
- Probie, let's go.
-Battalion 15 to Manhattan, transmit a 1075.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.947
Lou, take Sully, go to the floor
above the fire and do a search.

29:08.982 --> 29:10.914
- Join me?
- It would be an honor.

29:10.949 --> 29:14.369
Franco, take the first floor and the
basement. Bring the girl with you.

29:14.404 --> 29:18.766
- I don't see a girl here.
- You gotta be more observant, sweetheart.

29:18.801 --> 29:23.128
Move your ass. Battalion 15 to
Manhattan, transmit a 1075 at the box.

29:23.163 --> 29:25.630
We got a second floor fire
pushing out two windows.

29:26.030 --> 29:29.365
62 O.V., Battalion 15,
secondary search is negative.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.270
So what's the big deal? Why don't
you just tell me what happened?

29:32.305 --> 29:35.004
I went back to her place
and had some more beers.

29:35.039 --> 29:38.476
Did you score? It was so easy,
dude. She was all over me.

29:38.511 --> 29:41.878
Nice. So, you gonna see her
again or what? I don't know.

29:41.913 --> 29:45.416
I thought she was hot. She was
so skinny, it's like she was sick.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.920
I kept thinking of those starving
Ethiopian kids you see on TV.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.887
She had these
little twig legs.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.425
When we were doing it, her hips
were cutting into me. It hurt.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.392
You're a complete pussy,
you know that?

29:56.427 --> 29:59.931
Dude, I was afraid to get on top of
her. I kept hearing this cracking sound.

30:00.431 --> 30:03.434
You're scaring me. I don't wanna hear that
you don't wanna have sex with skinny chicks.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.453
You want another fat chick? No.

30:05.488 --> 30:07.438
Thank God.
Not another one.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.440
What?
Nothing.

30:09.741 --> 30:12.277
All clear. It looks
like it was electrical.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.779
Davey, go and write this up.
Come here a second.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.781
What's up? I got the goods on Perrolli.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.784
I figured with all this shit going on with
trying to get Tommy back into the firehouse,

30:20.251 --> 30:22.252
it'd be good to have
some dirt on this scumbag.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.790
What kind of dirt we talking?
Illegitimate daughter.

30:25.825 --> 30:29.294
Shee-ite. Nobody knows about
it, especially his wife.

30:29.329 --> 30:33.263
We're talking blackmail here.
Too rough?

30:33.298 --> 30:36.301
No, it's great. I'd just like to know
beforehand so I can fully enjoy it.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.303
Battalion 15, Manhattan.
What's your status?

30:38.803 --> 30:42.307
Battalion 15 to Manhattan,
99 and 62 going 10-8.

31:06.731 --> 31:08.733
Okay, inside.

31:18.843 --> 31:22.312
Hey, guys.
Daddy! Dad.

31:22.347 --> 31:26.584
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.551
Daddy!
Hey.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.553
I missed you so much.
I missed you too.

31:30.588 --> 31:32.924
Mom, Dad's here! Our new
house is small and dark.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.760
And it smells funny.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.061
Don't worry. Pack all your
stuff up. We're going home.

31:38.096 --> 31:42.934
Okay? Hurry up, guys. Pack
everything. Just wait for me inside.

31:42.969 --> 31:46.038
Pack it all up.
How'd you find us?

31:46.073 --> 31:49.107
Johnny traced
your credit cards.

31:49.474 --> 31:50.907
Really?
Yeah.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.944
I haven't used my credit
cards in three months.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.781
I find that hard to believe. Anyways,
go pack your stuff. We're heading home.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.450
Just like that?
You okay, Jan?

31:59.485 --> 32:02.085
Yeah, uh--

32:02.120 --> 32:06.291
Steve this is Tommy, my ex. Steve
works for the Department in Columbus.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.293
How you doing?

32:08.793 --> 32:10.561
Can I talk to you?
Go ahead.

32:11.796 --> 32:14.299
In the truck, Jan.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.236
I'll be right back.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.741
I had that same haircut...
back in 1975.

32:27.078 --> 32:31.047
Unbelievable.
Goddamn unbelievable.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.584
You really thought you were
gonna get away with this?

32:34.085 --> 32:36.654
Probably not, but I thought
I'd give it a shot.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.122
You take money from me,
you take my kids,

32:39.157 --> 32:41.659
you sell the house that I bought
out from under my nose. Thatwebought.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.662
I bought. I bought it with
my blood, my sweat, okay?

32:45.163 --> 32:48.499
This speech again. I can give you
several different speeches right now.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.800
You know I could
have you arrested?

32:50.835 --> 32:53.303
So, Tommy, do it,
if it'll make you feel better.

32:53.338 --> 32:57.342
You'd do great in jail. Least I'd know
I was somewhere you couldn't get at me.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.743
Let me tell you something.

33:00.778 --> 33:04.282
There's no place that you can
get away from me, okay? Huh?

33:04.317 --> 33:06.249
You drove halfway across
the country, I found you.

33:06.284 --> 33:10.788
Living with some mullet-headed hick? I want
my kids hanging around with a guy like that.

33:10.823 --> 33:14.959
Christ! And the goddamn joke of it
is, the guy's a goddamn firefighter,

33:14.994 --> 33:17.927
after all the years you told
me how much you hated the job,

33:17.962 --> 33:20.465
what the job did to me, the job was
my whole life. It wasn't the job.

33:20.500 --> 33:24.102
It was never the job.
It was you! It was you!

33:24.137 --> 33:28.423
Now, please, please,
just leave us alone.

33:28.458 --> 33:32.710
Wait, wait, look. I
quit drinking. Again?

33:33.077 --> 33:35.880
But I'm serious this time.
I mean, I really quit.

33:36.114 --> 33:41.386
Honestly, I went through a really
rough time after you guys left.

33:41.421 --> 33:43.353
I had a couple of episodes.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.391
I almost really...
spun off the planet.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.393
I'm no good
without you guys.

33:48.893 --> 33:51.896
I need-- I need-- I need
to have you back home.

34:06.677 --> 34:09.212
What about Sheila?

34:09.246 --> 34:14.018
Okay, that was a mistake. I'm not
seeing her anymore. I can-- I can fix it.

34:14.284 --> 34:17.219
She's three months pregnant.
How you gonna fix that?

34:17.255 --> 34:20.257
I don't know. I need to think
about it. I need some time.

34:20.293 --> 34:23.761
Let's deal with this
right now, okay?

34:25.263 --> 34:28.683
Listen. Why don't you go in
and pack your stuff.

34:28.717 --> 34:32.103
Get the kids. Let's
go home and start over.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.205
Okay, Tommy,
I gotta think about it.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.041
Come on.

34:40.277 --> 34:43.947
Give me 15 minutes.
Yeah, of course.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.395
Where the hell is he?

35:02.400 --> 35:05.903
Damn it, Tommy!
Come on.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.327
Jan?

35:32.330 --> 35:33.831
Hey, what's going on?

35:35.333 --> 35:36.834
Janet?

35:43.341 --> 35:45.074
Hey.
Looking for somebody?

35:45.109 --> 35:47.211
I'm looking for Janet. She said
she'd be ready in 15 minutes.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.180
Janet's not here anymore.
Get out of my way, asshole.

35:49.547 --> 35:53.017
She's at her house. Two
blocks over, down that way.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.520
She took the kids out the
back door and went home...

35:56.020 --> 35:59.023
and piled them and everything else she
could grab in 10 minutes in the car.

35:59.058 --> 36:01.324
Her truck's right here.
That's my truck.

36:01.359 --> 36:05.161
She told the kids they're
going to meet you at the hotel.

36:05.196 --> 36:08.533
They'll be 30 miles down the interstate
before they figure out what's really going on.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.168
You know, I owe you one, pal.
What are you talking about?

36:12.203 --> 36:16.541
Like I really wanted a long-term thing with
some needy chick and her three little brats.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.544
Get outta my way.
Hey, hey!

36:20.878 --> 36:23.047
Don't do that.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.387
I don't wanna
fight you, pal.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.656
All right, come on.
Come on, boy.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.725
All right, all right.
Say "uncle."

36:34.760 --> 36:36.359
What?
Come on! Say it!

36:36.394 --> 36:38.729
I'm not gonna say "uncle."
Yeah, you are. Say "uncle."

36:38.764 --> 36:41.732
I'm not saying "uncle."
Say it! Say it, asshole!

36:41.767 --> 36:44.001
All right.
All right, what?

36:44.036 --> 36:46.002
Uncle.
Huh?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.572
Uncle!
I can't hear you.

36:47.607 --> 36:50.206
I said "uncle."

36:50.241 --> 36:53.244
If you ever want a fresh one,
you just come back anytime.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.012
Prick.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.936
Nice meeting you, asshole.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.358
Hey, Theresa. It's me.

37:42.393 --> 37:45.396
I just wanted to call
and apologize...

37:45.431 --> 37:48.364
for what I said
the last time I called.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.736
I was really out of line,
and I didn't mean any of it.

37:51.771 --> 37:55.973
I-- I went out with
somebody else last night,

37:56.008 --> 37:58.476
but I thought about you
the whole time.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.980
If we could-- If we could
get together and talk--

38:03.015 --> 38:07.450
Mike?
Hey, you're home. Hi.

38:07.485 --> 38:11.489
Never call
this number again.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.791
Hey. What are you doing?

38:15.826 --> 38:18.461
Let's go. I'm out. I'm not doing it.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.431
- What? We made an agreement.
- I said I'm out!

38:20.931 --> 38:21.932
Mike!

38:22.400 --> 38:23.934
What time you got?
Ten past.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.437
Good.
Hey, what'd I miss?

38:26.937 --> 38:28.439
Just synchronizing
our watches.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.441
This is so cool. You
guys got the address?

38:30.941 --> 38:32.408
Check.
Phone?

38:32.443 --> 38:34.445
Check.
How's the battery?

38:34.480 --> 38:36.447
It's, uh, almost full.
Good.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.967
Well, it's about 90%.

38:39.002 --> 38:41.228
We--
More like 85 to 90.

38:41.263 --> 38:43.419
We gotta--
More like 85.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.921
Sean, this is the reason
why you're not going alone.

38:45.956 --> 38:50.194
Let's recap. You guys head out now.
Estimated time of arrival at Perrolli's house?

38:50.594 --> 38:53.262
- One half hour.
- He'll leave from here in 20 minutes to go home.

38:53.297 --> 38:56.801
I'll head him off, tell him what we know,
tell him we want Tommy back in the firehouse.

38:57.268 --> 39:00.805
If he says yes, we're done. I call
you. You come back to home base.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.207
If he says no, I call you
and give you the go signal.

39:03.242 --> 39:05.007
We knock on the door,
tell his wife everything.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.545
For some reason I don't see
that happening. Neither do I.

39:07.580 --> 39:10.815
Wait. It went down to
about 80. God help us.

39:10.850 --> 39:14.051
How did you find out?
Come on. People talk.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.519
It's ugly,
but it's human nature.

39:16.554 --> 39:21.058
Jesus. Well, whatever you do, Jerry,
I'm begging you, don't spread it around.

39:21.093 --> 39:23.060
That could do a lot of damage
to a lot of lives.

39:23.095 --> 39:26.080
Yeah. Imagine the reaction
from your wife.

39:26.115 --> 39:29.066
My wife? She wouldn't
be surprised at all.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.570
She hates my cousin's guts.
Always has.

39:32.605 --> 39:37.039
Your cousin?
Robert. Rob Perrolli.

39:37.074 --> 39:40.578
Wait a minute. You thought it
was me with the illegitimate kid?

39:41.078 --> 39:42.580
Well--

39:43.080 --> 39:45.583
You putz!
See ya tomorrow.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.087
Oh, Jesus.

39:50.588 --> 39:52.590
Whatever you do,
do not go into that house.

39:53.090 --> 39:56.360
And do not talk to the wife.
Just turn around and go!

39:56.395 --> 39:58.095
Chief?
Well?

39:58.596 --> 40:01.599
The connection sucks. But I
definitely heard him say it was a go.

40:01.634 --> 40:05.102
Ah, shit. All of a sudden I'm
not liking this plan so much.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.104
Yeah, me neither.

40:08.806 --> 40:11.275
Yes? Hi. We work with your husband.

40:11.776 --> 40:14.278
I'm Ken Shea.
I'm Sean Garrity. Hi.

40:14.313 --> 40:16.245
He should be home soon.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.784
I was wondering if maybe we could come
in and talk to you for a few seconds.

40:19.819 --> 40:22.286
Sure. Come on in.

40:32.630 --> 40:36.133
And now, making, I believe,
their first appearance...

40:36.168 --> 40:38.601
in the semifinal round
in four years,

40:38.636 --> 40:42.139
from Staten Island, New York,
the Smoketeers.

40:53.150 --> 40:56.619
One little quarrel

40:56.654 --> 41:02.493
And two lovers parted

41:02.860 --> 41:06.263
He's sad and lonely

41:06.730 --> 41:10.267
And she's brokenhearted

41:10.302 --> 41:12.269
Colleen?

41:12.703 --> 41:15.172
Both of them know

41:15.673 --> 41:18.926
They're to blame

41:18.961 --> 41:22.179
This wasn't part

41:22.546 --> 41:28.519
Of the game

41:29.553 --> 41:32.523
He calls to tell her

41:32.558 --> 41:35.210
His mind's

41:35.245 --> 41:37.862
In a whirl

41:38.229 --> 41:44.702
He can't even think
of his name

41:44.737 --> 41:47.972
She says that she is

41:48.007 --> 41:49.707
As blue

41:50.207 --> 41:55.980
As can be

41:56.247 --> 41:58.716
That nothing at home

41:58.751 --> 42:00.683
Seems

42:00.718 --> 42:06.223
The same

42:08.259 --> 42:11.729
The chairs
in the parlor

42:12.229 --> 42:16.149
All miss

42:16.184 --> 42:20.070
You

42:21.939 --> 42:25.576
The pictures all frown

42:25.611 --> 42:31.916
On the wall

42:33.817 --> 42:37.838
The flowers

42:37.873 --> 42:41.824
Won't grow

42:41.859 --> 42:44.361
For they seem

42:44.862 --> 42:47.364
To know

42:47.865 --> 42:51.333
That the sunshine

42:51.368 --> 42:58.108
Won't come in at all

43:00.444 --> 43:04.281
Our little canary

43:04.316 --> 43:08.553
Won't sing

43:08.588 --> 43:12.790
Anymore

43:13.791 --> 43:16.794
The folks ask me why

43:16.829 --> 43:20.732
What happened?

43:20.767 --> 43:24.635
You don't call

43:25.135 --> 43:29.139
Our whole house

43:29.640 --> 43:33.143
Is blue

43:36.413 --> 43:40.534
They want you

43:40.569 --> 43:43.863
Only you

43:43.898 --> 43:47.122
But I

43:47.157 --> 43:52.663
Miss you most

43:52.698 --> 43:55.130
Of all

43:55.165 --> 43:57.668
I miss you most

43:57.703 --> 44:01.189
Of

44:01.224 --> 44:04.675
All

44:49.053 --> 44:50.220
Cloudland.
