painted by a five year-old

00:38.240 --> 00:40.230
miller art gallery downtown los angeles

00:42.790 --> 00:44.790
your money's on the desk.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.550
what a piece of crap.

01:01.260 --> 01:04.690
one month later northeast los angeles
Please...please don't shoot;don't shoot me.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.420
Just put the gun down.

01:06.430 --> 01:07.640
Gently.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.800
I can't shoot. That's the problem.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.100
The stupid thingis busted.

01:11.110 --> 01:15.500
Well,when it comesto mr.Bartowski,my
friend,busted is just a state of mind.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.380
Opening this puppy up. reconfigure that.

01:18.390 --> 01:22.920
And ta-da--locked
and loaded. Try that.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.370
nice shot. See?

01:25.380 --> 01:28.230
- Chuck,big mikewants to see you.
- Not now,harry.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.300
Can't you seeI'm with a
customer? I apologize,sir.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.370
This is not normallyhow
we do things at buy more.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.310
Now,chuck!

01:33.320 --> 01:35.590
I was just on my wayto
see you-- that's crazy.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.520
Pause that.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.160
bartowski,what is itthat
you want out of life?

01:45.170 --> 01:48.340
You mean,existentially--like,fulfillment,inner
peace,that kind of a thing?

01:48.350 --> 01:51.340
Or are we talkingmore practically,like,lakers
tickets,personal steam room...

01:51.350 --> 01:52.830
we're talking buy more.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.590
Career objectives.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.730
Where do you see yourselfin
five years,ten years?

01:56.740 --> 01:57.850
Honestly?

01:57.860 --> 01:58.690
Honestly.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.100
I have absolutely no idea.

02:00.110 --> 02:02.080
Well,then it's timeyou
started to think about it.

02:02.090 --> 02:04.740
As you know,there's an
assistantmanagement position open.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.610
It's down to youand harry tang.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.210
Now,you want that job or not?

02:09.220 --> 02:10.810
I do,I do.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.010
Uh,I'm sorry,big mike.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.780
I absolutely want that job.

02:13.790 --> 02:18.040
Well,then,bartowski,it's
your turnto show me something.

02:19.650 --> 02:21.350
I got some bad news.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.330
Big mike wants us tofix all
of this junk in two days,

02:24.340 --> 02:27.930
or he's going to give the assistant
store managerposition to tang.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.380
I'm sorry,guys.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.080
And anna.

02:30.090 --> 02:31.080
Guys is fine. I don't mind.

02:31.090 --> 02:33.730
No,it's not right. We need to come
up withsomething non-gender specific.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.280
How do we feel about team?

02:35.290 --> 02:36.880
The little nerd herders?

02:36.890 --> 02:37.880
The lesters?

02:37.890 --> 02:40.920
Chuck's stable of hos.

02:40.930 --> 02:42.570
Hey...

02:42.580 --> 02:46.620
Oh,man,uh,heard big
mikethrew down the gauntlet.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.890
Wanted to come byand
say I'd love to help.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.710
But,a: I lackthe skill set,and
B.Old computersgive me the willies.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.710
You have no idea how much courage
it's takenjust to stand here.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.540
I'm really proudof you,buddy.

02:56.550 --> 02:57.710
Thanks,bro.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.750
I bring you news.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.820
What?

02:59.830 --> 03:01.190
Your lady's here.

03:01.840 --> 03:06.120
And if I'm not oversteppingmy
bounds,looking good.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.740
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.810
Give me a kiss.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.070
I'm sorry. What?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.730
We've been onthree dates.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.970
We have to sell it.

03:33.290 --> 03:34.360
That's it?

03:34.370 --> 03:36.630
I'm not really goodwith pda.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.010
Well,let's gosomewhere more private.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.530
Shall we?

03:49.110 --> 03:51.300
Okay,he is so in. This is...

03:51.310 --> 03:53.780
hey. Okay,whoa!

03:53.790 --> 03:56.370
Why don'twe give the
kids a little privacy?

04:00.050 --> 04:01.540
not cool.

04:03.230 --> 04:05.540
Sorry to break upyour little tryst.

04:05.550 --> 04:08.740
Next time you needto talk to the
subject,I'd appreciatea heads up.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.410
Relax. I wouldn't dream of
starting without you,agent casey.

04:11.420 --> 04:15.010
Mom,dad,can we get on with
it? I have hard drivesto fix.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.399
Why are these people sleeping?

04:19.410 --> 04:20.450
Casey: They're notsleeping.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.470
They werekilled,chuck,and
we want to know why.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.440
I have no idea.

04:24.450 --> 04:25.060
Well,look again.

04:25.070 --> 04:27.900
I would rather not. It's kind of creepy.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.360
Sorry.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.980
I was goingto take a nap.

04:31.990 --> 04:35.630
I'll come back in five. Kind
of called dibs on the couch?

04:42.920 --> 04:43.750
Chuck,what did you see?

04:43.760 --> 04:45.750
Um,I don'T...I'm not...
I'm not totally sure.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.350
A water lily painting,weapons,an
art auction tomorrow night.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.240
Does the name la
ciudadmean anything to you?

04:53.670 --> 04:54.320
Why?

04:54.330 --> 04:57.440
Because I thinkhe's going to be
at the art auctiontomorrow night.

04:58.620 --> 04:59.270
Right then.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.290
I'm goingto go fix some hard drives.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.030
Good luck with the spy stuff. Excuse me.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.290
Ellie: Chuck,I am so proud of you.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.040
Morgan told me about
theassistant management job.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.760
Congratulations.

05:09.770 --> 05:12.300
Team bartowski moving
upin the world,huh?

05:12.720 --> 05:16.710
okay,first of all,it's not mine yet,and
second of all,you can ease upon the enthusiasm.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.540
It's only a two dollar an hour
raise at anelectronics store,

05:19.550 --> 05:21.850
and it doesn't even give
memy own parking space.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.410
Well,does your lack of interestmean that

05:23.420 --> 05:26.300
you're actually considering leaving
the buy morefor a real profession?

05:26.310 --> 05:27.840
Real profession? Sorry.

05:27.850 --> 05:30.020
I'm goingto need clarification on that.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.030
He went to stanford,for
god's sakes,morgan.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.060
Right,and was unceremoniouslyexpelled
sophomore year--

05:34.070 --> 05:37.060
sorry to bring that up,champ-- butI think
we need to be realistic about our goals here.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.680
His goals or your goals?

05:38.690 --> 05:42.450
Great question,and I think we need to hammer outa
plan for chuck. Where do we see him in five years?

05:42.920 --> 05:44.480
- Ten years?
- We?

05:44.490 --> 05:46.500
Fine. Then just you and I.

05:46.510 --> 05:49.590
Woman: We're glad to hear you've
settled into chuck's apartment building.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.510
But if he's right,this
is a high priority.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.510
La ciudad is the most elusive and
dangerous arms dealer in the world.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.460
And the last anyone heard,mi-6 in
london had a drop on him,but he vanished.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.640
Well,if he turns up,we'll
justtake him down at the auction.

06:03.650 --> 06:04.630
Man: Not so easy.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.960
We have no idea whathe
looks like,no photographs.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.900
No one has ever seen la ciudadthat
has lived to tell about it.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.360
So we'll bringthe intersect.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.880
Everything you knowabout la
ciudad was fed into that computer.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.130
No way. It is too dangerous.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.090
He has no field experienceor training.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.100
He'll be fine. It's an art auction.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.360
Morgan: Listen to me-- it
isway to scary out there.

06:22.370 --> 06:23.930
Chuck can't leavethe buy more.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.220
We're stillfinding ourselves.

06:25.230 --> 06:29.040
Ellie: No offense,morgan,but I think my brother
has spent quitea few years finding himself,

06:29.050 --> 06:31.840
and he's definitely proventhat his
place in life is not at the buy more.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.800
Morgan:You don't understand.
He is a fragilelittle gelding.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.310
You know,still tryingto find his legs.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.790
The real world will crush him.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.020
Do you knowwhat a gelding is?

06:43.460 --> 06:46.480
it's the... that weird
creaturefrom the dark crystal.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.980
Smells like gelding. That-that guy.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.430
He'll be fine.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.190
La ciudad probablywon't even be there.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.150
And if he is,is it worth the risk?

06:53.160 --> 06:54.990
All right,I've heard enough.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.010
Put him in the field.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.770
We don't know what he's capable
of until he's been tested.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.240
What he needs issomething
to challenge him.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.320
To test hislimitations.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.430
A brush withhis own mortality.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.460
You know what I'm thinking?

07:05.470 --> 07:06.640
I have no ideawhat you're thinking.

07:06.650 --> 07:09.210
As far as I'm concerned,dude,you're
way off the reservation.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.260
Class five whitewater rapids.

07:11.270 --> 07:12.850
Just the two ofus this weekend.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.270
Near-deathexperience.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.540
Awesome!

07:15.550 --> 07:18.520
That sounds great,but my wet
suit'sat the dry cleaners.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.090
That is a terrible idea.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.130
That's way too dangerous.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.160
I agree,and I am not comfortable with you
guys spendingthat amount of time together.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.940
Well,chuck hasn't said a
word. What do you want to do?

07:27.570 --> 07:28.650
I'm just going to hit the sack.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.850
Good night,team bartowski.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.490
that's-that's great work,guys.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.740
You see what you're doing
here? That's awesome.

07:35.780 --> 07:36.830
Congratulations,chuck.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.290
You just got your
firstmission-- tomorrow night.

07:40.810 --> 07:42.920
Hope you're readyfor the real world,huh?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.370
So,dress attire for this
evening-- uh,sneakers,

08:19.380 --> 08:21.210
or are we classifying this
as more of a shoe event?

08:21.220 --> 08:22.160
I rented you a tux.

08:22.170 --> 08:23.370
Oh,that's very nice...

08:23.380 --> 08:24.280
how did you know my size?

08:24.290 --> 08:27.850
Nsa-- they have records of your
rental information from prom night.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.440
I checked the suit in your closet.

08:29.450 --> 08:32.390
Okay,this is my first foray
into major undercover spy work,

08:32.400 --> 08:34.429
so you could ease up on the
sarcasm. That would be great.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.280
And how am I supposed to recognize la
ciudad? Is there a picture or something?

08:37.289 --> 08:39.580
If there was a photograph,why
would we need you?

08:39.590 --> 08:40.799
What did we just talk about?

08:40.809 --> 08:41.470
I'm sorry.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.260
We're hoping something in
the event triggers a flash.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.530
See,that's all you had to say.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.860
Now,uh,hand-to-hand
combat-- in all seriousness,

08:46.870 --> 08:49.140
if it comes down to me and la ciudad in
some fisticuffs or something,is there,

08:49.150 --> 08:51.140
like,a 20-minute tutorial
you can take me through?

08:51.150 --> 08:52.330
Don't worry. You're going to be fine.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.060
Nothing's going to happen to you.

08:54.070 --> 08:56.490
Assuming you know how to tango.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.920
Seriously?

08:57.930 --> 09:00.460
Oh,I don't joke about your life.

09:02.170 --> 09:02.810
Right.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.300
Chuck,your girlfriend's here.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.880
One minute,I have computers to fix.

09:06.890 --> 09:08.440
Anna: Don't worry about it. We got it.

09:08.450 --> 09:09.440
There's only a few left.

09:09.450 --> 09:10.440
What? Are you sure?

09:10.450 --> 09:13.610
It's done,but next time I have a big
date,you are going to cover for me.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.830
Okay.Great. Thanks,team.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.590
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.740
Thanks,team.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.000
Where are you lovebirds headed?

09:19.010 --> 09:22.310
We're actually going to an art
auction at the wilshire grand.

09:22.550 --> 09:23.510
Swanky!

09:23.520 --> 09:24.780
Yeah,I like it,man.

09:24.790 --> 09:27.590
Uh,aren't we moving
a little too fast now?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.810
Career,girl.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.090
Guy's got it all.

09:31.100 --> 09:36.690
The idea with a cover is to keep it as simple as
possible without revealing true personal detail.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.040
Any thoughts on a name?

09:39.050 --> 09:40.300
Charles carmichael?

09:40.310 --> 09:41.520
Simple,dignified.

09:41.530 --> 09:45.560
- Easy to remember and not far off from...
- graduated with honors from stanford.

09:45.570 --> 09:48.070
Runs a hugely successful
software company.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.400
Semi-retired and is considering
entering america's cup.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.170
Have you donethis before?

09:53.180 --> 09:57.830
Let's just say,uh,mr. Carmichael
and I sharea small kinship.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.850
How's that?

10:00.980 --> 10:02.390
When I first entered stanford,

10:02.400 --> 10:06.670
it's kind of where I envisionedmyself
being by now,except for the sailing part.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.360
I don't really knowwhere that came from.

10:08.370 --> 10:11.540
But he's where most
of my classalready is.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.000
So,what happened?

10:13.010 --> 10:14.900
My life took a little
detoursophomore year

10:14.910 --> 10:18.760
when our old friendbryce larkin
discovered stolen testsunder my bed,

10:18.770 --> 10:21.600
and was kind enoughto
alert administration.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.770
Did you steal the tests?

10:22.780 --> 10:26.070
I thought it was kind of
impliedthat I'm a decent person.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.780
Well,we all make mistakes.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.440
And I made plenty. That
just wasn't one of them.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.970
But,hey,then bryce sent mea whole database of
government secretsthat are now locked in my brain,

10:35.980 --> 10:41.370
keeping me in a constant stateof fear,danger
and anxiety,so I'd say we're even.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.960
Don't worryabout tonight.

10:42.970 --> 10:44.350
No reason tobe nervous.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.720
I am not going toleave your side.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.600
Me nervous? Come on.Never.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.170
Your hand isa little moist.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.000
It does thatwhen I'm freaking out.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.380
Hey,sis.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.860
Hey,sis,um... do you know how to tango?

10:59.870 --> 11:01.700
No,why?

11:01.710 --> 11:02.870
Oh,no reason.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.020
I just,I have a date tonight.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.100
I thought it might come up.

11:06.110 --> 11:07.980
You're tangoing on a date?

11:07.990 --> 11:09.640
Well,that's definitelynew territory.

11:09.650 --> 11:11.390
It's good to see you
reachingoutside of your comfort zone.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.210
Well,consideringmy comfort zone
extends to the endof that couch,

11:14.220 --> 11:16.670
new territorywas bound to come up.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.100
Did someone say tango?

11:18.110 --> 11:20.240
No,thank you,captain
awesome,I'll look it up online.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.730

something,a robe or something?

11:22.740 --> 11:24.940
Did a semester abroadin buenos aires.

11:24.950 --> 11:29.420
Spent many a nighttangoing my
way into señoritas' pantalones.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.090
And... go.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.860
There's no way he's going to
breakthe two minute record.

12:28.870 --> 12:29.740
Ooh,there.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.040

Good leadership.

12:45.860 --> 12:46.850

12:46.860 --> 12:50.130
Well,it shouldn't be too difficult
to getthese done by morning.

13:27.420 --> 13:28.870

13:33.150 --> 13:34.200
I wouldn't callmyself an expert...

13:34.210 --> 13:36.830

howto tango? Is that code?

13:36.840 --> 13:40.130

Mi-6 intercepteda painting with
plutoniumhidden in the frame.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.370
Rather thanannounce the
bust,we removedthe plutonium

23:20.380 --> 23:23.690
and kept the auction in
the hopeof luring ciudad.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.630
If you're not la
ciudad,then where is he?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.320
Whoa,whoa,whoa,okay,okay,listen
to me,so,listen to me.

23:44.330 --> 23:48.000
My friend is at some sort of
artfunction at your hotel,okay?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.370
Uh,now listento me clearly.

23:49.380 --> 23:50.590
I need to speak to him.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.640
It's a matter of life and death.

23:52.650 --> 23:54.000
Describe your friend.

23:54.010 --> 23:54.730
Morgan:He's good-looking.

23:54.740 --> 23:56.610
You know,it depends on
your angle,I suppose.

23:56.620 --> 23:57.560
Uh,he's not classicallyhandsome.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.720
I wouldn't say he is,you know.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.510
But he makes up for itwith
charm. Lots of,uh...of charm.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.550
And he's kind of a lost soul.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.750
Does this funny little
thingwhen he's nervous.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.760
He laughs. He goes...

24:04.770 --> 24:05.840
he kind of does this...

24:05.850 --> 24:07.930
uh,anyways,what,uh,what,what?

24:07.940 --> 24:09.280
Uh,brown hair,six-one.

24:09.290 --> 24:10.370
Does that help at all?

24:10.380 --> 24:11.520
What,uh...

24:11.530 --> 24:13.900
what line ofwork are you in,malena?

24:13.910 --> 24:16.540
Why are you so interested,mr.Carmichael?

24:16.550 --> 24:19.320
No reason. Just making conversation.

24:19.330 --> 24:20.300
Excuse me,sir.

24:20.310 --> 24:21.780
Are you chuck bartowski?

24:21.790 --> 24:23.860
Who,me? No!

24:23.870 --> 24:24.830
No,I'm carmichael.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.100
Uh,that's him. That's
my... that's my friend.

24:26.110 --> 24:28.420
I can hear his voice. Hey,chuck!

24:28.430 --> 24:29.880
Are you sure you'renot mr.Bartowski?

24:29.890 --> 24:31.130
Your friend insists.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.500
No,no,I insist.

24:32.510 --> 24:35.270
I've never heardthat name in my life.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.010
I got to go. Excuse me.

24:39.930 --> 24:44.960
Why don't we head up tomy room
now,mr.Carmichael,and find outwho you really are.

24:46.620 --> 24:47.700
okay.

24:52.610 --> 24:55.310
Uh,so I guess we
shouldregroup in the morning?

24:55.320 --> 24:56.300
Good idea.

24:56.310 --> 24:58.200
No,wait,wait,wait,wait.
Where youguys going?

24:58.210 --> 25:00.110
Dude,it's just... it's
out of my pay grade.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.800
I got to get someserious alcohol
in me or I am nevergoing to sleep.

25:03.810 --> 25:05.500
Anna: I'm sorry,morgan. Be strong.

25:05.510 --> 25:07.200
No,no,come on,guys,don't leave
me in herewith these computers.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.810
You can hand me a
slice,maybe some water.

25:08.820 --> 25:11.960
I need to survivethrough
the night,and I...

25:12.710 --> 25:14.480
not cool!

25:27.700 --> 25:30.140
Malena: Let's startwith an easy one.

25:30.150 --> 25:31.220
What's your real name?

25:31.230 --> 25:34.580
Carmichael,charles carmichael.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.470
Chuck bartowski.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.190
That wasn't so hard.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.430
Now...

25:44.440 --> 25:46.780
before you answermy next question,

25:46.790 --> 25:50.270
I want you to think long
andhard about my options here.

25:50.280 --> 25:55.300
There's the old favorite--
yank out a tooth.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.430
Too noisy.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.330
cut off a toe.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.420
That's too messy.

26:00.430 --> 26:01.560
Far too messy.

26:01.570 --> 26:04.680
Or we can chuck you offthe balcony...

26:04.690 --> 26:05.970
chuck.

26:05.980 --> 26:08.480
Probably landface first.

26:08.490 --> 26:11.070
Teeth go through theback of your head.

26:11.940 --> 26:15.140
not a good way to go. So...

26:15.150 --> 26:20.420
here's my question: Who do you work for?

26:21.950 --> 26:23.720
No one.

26:23.730 --> 26:24.530
No,no,stop,stop!

26:24.540 --> 26:25.850
I fix computersfor a living!

26:25.860 --> 26:26.640
I swear to god!

26:26.650 --> 26:28.800
I snuck into the partyunder
a fake name to impress a girl!

26:28.810 --> 26:31.010
Please,please,down... put chair down!

26:31.020 --> 26:31.670
Good-bye,chuck.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.840
No,no,no,it's a setup!

26:33.850 --> 26:35.790
What is?

26:35.800 --> 26:36.470
The painting?

26:36.480 --> 26:37.560
The painting.

26:37.570 --> 26:38.780
The painting,I think.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.660
I think the painting
mightbe a fake or something.

26:41.670 --> 26:42.520
Why?

26:42.530 --> 26:44.770
If you put me downI'll tell you.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.040
I saw a photoof the painting
in the L.A.Times,okay?

26:51.050 --> 26:52.570
But it hada different frame.

26:52.580 --> 26:54.590
So I'm assuming somebody maybe
swapped it out,I don't know.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.450
But if I were you,I would
not buy that painting.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.930
A fake painting.

26:57.940 --> 27:00.500
And you had no
intentionof bidding on it?

27:00.510 --> 27:01.310
Me? Bid on...

27:01.320 --> 27:03.130
No,not unless they
wereselling it for 25 bucks.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.960
I mean,that's about what I
havein my decorating budget.

27:04.970 --> 27:08.700
Okay,tell me howto fix a computer,chuck.

27:16.710 --> 27:19.960
my first inclination isthat your bus speed
is not up to snuff with your video card.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.930
I'm assuming we're talking
about a pc here,right?

27:21.940 --> 27:23.380
Is your memorydedicated?

27:23.390 --> 27:25.320
That's enough,mr.Bartowski.

27:25.330 --> 27:26.610
I believe you.

27:26.620 --> 27:30.180
the problem is since you've
seen me,now I have to kill you.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.110
Have... have to,have to?

27:31.120 --> 27:32.500
No,no,no,I disagree,I disagree...

27:32.510 --> 27:33.490
vehemently,vehemently.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.900
No,no,no,I won't
sayanything,I swear to god.

27:34.910 --> 27:37.680
You don't know the things
I know about people.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.410
Don't worry,it'll be fast.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.780
Good-bye,mr.Bartowski.

27:44.790 --> 27:47.290
I enjoyed our tango.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.700
I didn't likeit that much.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.090
- Really?
- He was kind of silly.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.390
Oh,I kind of liked him. Hi.

28:04.700 --> 28:05.710
They're on to us.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.700
The sec knows everything.

28:07.710 --> 28:09.890
Shelly,they knowabout the caymans.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.710
I surrender! I surrender!

28:13.720 --> 28:15.590
Get down,chuck.

28:19.310 --> 28:21.010
Chuck:Sarah!

28:21.760 --> 28:23.570
Let's do this.

28:32.990 --> 28:34.970
oh,my god!

28:37.020 --> 28:38.170
it's okay,chuck.

28:38.180 --> 28:39.580
- Are you okay?
- Okay?Okay?

28:39.590 --> 28:40.910
Two more seconds andI'd have been dead.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.200
They were going tothrow
me off the balcony.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.420
Did you tell themyou work for us?

28:43.430 --> 28:44.210
Of course not.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.430
Where the hellwere you guys?

28:45.440 --> 28:46.310
You're still alive.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.690
I'd consider myself lucky.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.680
We have to get youout of the country.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.830
First we take him out.

29:07.090 --> 29:08.160
Hey.

29:08.170 --> 29:09.060
How was the big date?

29:09.070 --> 29:11.140
It was good,great,fine.
I'm going to go to bed.

29:11.150 --> 29:11.880
- I love you.
- What?

29:11.890 --> 29:13.860
No,no,no,no.

29:13.870 --> 29:14.860
Is that all I get?

29:14.870 --> 29:17.410
Come on,sit down.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.080
I want to know,you
know,do you like this girl?

29:20.090 --> 29:22.930
It'S... you know,it's complicated.

29:22.940 --> 29:26.290
Well,explain it to me
slowly,I'll catch up.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.620
She's a very beautiful girl.

29:29.980 --> 29:31.720
Good. Go on.

29:32.110 --> 29:34.490
And she's very agile.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.130
I'm not sure how
thatapplies,but continue.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.320
And I think she's tooexhausting for me.

29:41.570 --> 29:43.090
Well,what happened?

29:43.100 --> 29:43.850
Did you guys tango?

29:43.860 --> 29:45.140
Oh,yeah,yeah. We tangoed.

29:45.150 --> 29:49.830
In fact,we tangoedquite a bit,but awesome
taught methe woman's pa of the tango,

29:49.840 --> 29:53.060
so it was a little
difficult,as one might expect.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.820
Awesome:What's up,bro?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.290
- Did you do thefamous dip?
- Yeah.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.670
I was on thereceiving end of that dip.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.200
You did tango witha woman,right?

30:00.210 --> 30:01.600
And on that note...

30:01.610 --> 30:04.570
no,no,no,no,no. You're
notgetting off that easy.

30:06.350 --> 30:08.200
Why won't you talk to me?

30:08.210 --> 30:10.630
It's...

30:11.080 --> 30:14.240
it's complicated,okay? Just let it go.

30:14.770 --> 30:16.230
Fine.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.340
You don't wantto talk to me,

30:17.350 --> 30:21.540
I suggest you findsomeone to talk
to like maybe your idiot friend.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.500
He's called about 75 times.

30:23.510 --> 30:26.670
He locked himselfin a storage cage.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.050
Whatever that means.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.720
Oh,god! It's you.

30:52.730 --> 30:54.570
Dude,dude,you have no idea.

30:54.580 --> 30:55.540
Okay,okay,okay.

30:55.550 --> 30:56.930
Settle down,settle down,settle down.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.550
Settle downit's all good. It's all good.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.760
What happened?

30:59.770 --> 31:01.280
Oh,what happened?

31:01.290 --> 31:03.770
Tang showed up,and he
dropped all these off.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.570
I guess he was stashingthem,you know?

31:06.580 --> 31:07.860
So...

31:07.870 --> 31:09.770
all right,let's do this.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.490
What are you talking... Morgan,you
don't knowhow to fix a computer.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.710
Moral support,man. Never...

31:13.720 --> 31:15.120
never leaveyour wingman,okay?

31:15.130 --> 31:17.090
Something your team couldlearn
a little something about.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.290
Look,it's okay,man.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.310
Go get some sleep,okay?

31:20.320 --> 31:20.860
Are you sure?

31:20.870 --> 31:22.800
'Cause you say the word
and we go down together.

31:22.810 --> 31:26.380
No. I appreciate that,but I think it'll be
nice to do somethingI'm actually good at,

31:26.390 --> 31:27.340
so I'll see you.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.350
Fantastic. I'll see
you later.Good night.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.780
Good night.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.210
You finished,bartowski?

31:59.600 --> 32:00.810
Mission accomplished.

32:01.410 --> 32:02.740
Two days was meantas an incentive.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.160
I didn't think you'd really do it.

32:04.170 --> 32:05.070
I'm impressed.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.770
And I'm not a maneasily impressed.

32:06.780 --> 32:11.300
Why,I think you should know thatI only fixed
the last few--my team did most of the work.

32:11.310 --> 32:12.170
They deserve the credit.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.600
And you're only as
goodas your team,so...

32:13.610 --> 32:17.160
first rule of
management:Always take credit.

32:17.170 --> 32:18.530
Hope we can sell all this crap.

32:18.540 --> 32:24.980
Sir,there's beena major infraction--
drinkingalcoholic beverages on the property.

32:24.990 --> 32:28.190
Nothing wrong with a man wetting
his whistleevery once in a while.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.640
Keep it out of thestore,bartowski.

32:29.650 --> 32:31.350
Yeah.Yeah. Absolutely,sir.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.890
You get extra points for style.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.680
Looking sharp.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.470
You look like a waiter.

32:41.740 --> 32:42.520
kiss-ass.

32:42.530 --> 32:43.800
Was I scared?

32:43.810 --> 32:45.170
Yeah. Yeah,I was scared.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.860
But then this
survivalinstinct kicked in.

32:46.870 --> 32:49.200
Something I didn'teven know I possessed.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.410
A desire to live.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.350
Good news is,I may be ableto
retire off this,all right?

32:52.360 --> 32:53.280
I talked to big mike.

32:53.290 --> 32:54.830
I told him he'd be
hearingfrom my attorney.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.750
That cage isa major fire hazard.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.260
Chuck.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.490
Good work last night.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.410
Okay,you know what?

33:00.420 --> 33:02.740
I'm,I'm workingon an
all-nighter here,big guy.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.820
And I realize that
you areprobably armed.

33:04.830 --> 33:08.900
And so I'm gonna ask youvery nicely,would
you please easeup on the sarcasm.

33:08.910 --> 33:10.680
I wasn't being facetious.

33:10.690 --> 33:12.160
You helped us find la ciudad.

33:12.170 --> 33:13.050
But she got away.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.110
Yeah,we got a photofrom hotel security.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.490
We got a blood samplefrom
a broken window.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.820
Our intel tell usshe's heading
down to central america.

33:19.830 --> 33:22.170
We have peoplewaiting there.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.480
You're lookin' sharp.

33:23.490 --> 33:24.910
Yeah,thanks.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.470
That was facetious. Idiot.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.800
I fixed this one personally.

33:28.810 --> 33:30.400
So it should begood as new.

33:30.410 --> 33:32.300
And sorry about the delay.

33:57.690 --> 34:00.010
Chuck,hiding from work again?

I-I know that I'vebeen kind of evasive.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.710
It's just that I...

38:29.720 --> 38:34.490
I didn't want to lie to you and I chose notsaying
anything as being the lesserof two evils.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.640
Why would youhave to lie to me?

38:35.650 --> 38:38.330
Ellie,I just need youto trust me and
know it has nothingto do with you.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.930
But you want me to butt out. I get it.

38:39.940 --> 38:40.720
It's none of my business.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.260

38:42.270 --> 38:44.480
I'm not saying that. I-I...

38:45.220 --> 38:49.320
I just don't wantto create a false senseof
excitement for a relationshipthat seems doomed.

38:49.330 --> 38:51.540
Why is it doomed?

38:52.160 --> 38:54.280
Because she'snot into me.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.340
Uh,trust me.

38:55.350 --> 38:57.990
I have seen the way thatthat girl
looks at you and she is into you.

I'm not really a spy.

41:05.220 --> 41:08.580
Your computer ended upin the head of a guy
who only knows how to fix 'em,nothing else.

41:08.590 --> 41:11.540
You surviveda near-death experience
under the threatof torture

41:11.550 --> 41:14.290
and apprehended one of the
world'smost elusive killers.

I'm not sure you what
you thinkspies do exactly,

41:16.280 --> 41:18.510

a major internationalarms dealer,

41:22.640 --> 41:27.840

dating,this would bethe part

41:41.410 --> 41:43.910
where I'd be forced
to kissyou good night.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.790
Forced?

41:45.800 --> 41:47.890
Would it beso bad?
