"Happy birthday to you

01:12.280 --> 01:17.354
"Happy birthday, dear Chelsea

01:18.160 --> 01:23.518
"Happy birthday to you"

02:52.280 --> 02:54.748
- Happy birthday.
- Good night.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.269
Chelsea!

03:45.440 --> 03:49.069
Chelsea, come on. We have no time.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.998
My painting! Where's my painting?

04:04.760 --> 04:07.274
Daddy! Daddy!

04:07.560 --> 04:09.198
Daddy!

04:10.960 --> 04:13.155
Bob, get the hell out of there!

04:15.800 --> 04:16.755
Jesus!

04:37.520 --> 04:38.919
<i>This was the scene 18 years ago...</i>

04:39.000 --> 04:42.879
<i>... as millions of dollars worth</i>
<i>of Deardon paintings went up in smoke.</i>

04:43.240 --> 04:44.992
<i>Deardon perished in the flames.</i>

04:45.080 --> 04:48.231
<i>Surviving the inferno was</i>
<i>his 8-year-old daughter, Chelsea.</i>

04:48.320 --> 04:50.959
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>that same Chelsea Deardon, now 26...</i>

04:51.040 --> 04:54.874
<i>... was arrested for attempting to steal</i>
<i>one of her father's valuable paintings...</i>

04:54.960 --> 04:58.589
<i>... from Robert Forrester's</i>
<i>Manhattan penthouse. Police...</i>

04:58.680 --> 05:00.159
I was watching that.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.629
Sorry! The news is so boring.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.359
Did you do your homework?

05:05.440 --> 05:06.998
I'm just finishing it.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.277
Your mother always tells me
to make sure you do it.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.079
You tell me you have no homework.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.909
Why is that?

05:17.040 --> 05:20.476
I only have to write one paragraph
on an emotion. It's easy.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.352
Easy? You think things are easy?

05:22.440 --> 05:25.796
- Can we go out for breakfast?
- No, we can't. We ate out last night.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.030
When you stay with me, we're a family.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.269
We eat in...

05:29.600 --> 05:30.794
...occasionally.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.351
- Dad?
- Yeah.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.151
You didn't sleep again, did you?

05:39.160 --> 05:41.958
- You didn't sleep again.
- I slept.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.349
I woke up and I heard
these strange sounds.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.870
And...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.070
Were you dancing in the bathroom?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.793
Dancing in the bathroom?

05:54.880 --> 05:58.395
Mom says whenever you can't sleep,
you tap dance in the bathroom.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.159
Do you believe that?

06:01.920 --> 06:04.639
So I danced once or twice,
but I don't tap dance.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.630
Dad!

06:13.360 --> 06:15.078
Get back. I can handle it.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.155
Got it.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.156
Don't tell Mom about the toast.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.908
See you in a few days.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.399
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.793
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Tom.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.518
- You're going to court.
- Court?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.989
Howard Marchek,
receiving stolen property.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.235
Slumber party?

06:59.320 --> 07:02.835
- Marcheck is Henning's case.
- Yours now. He has laryngitis.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.112
Tom, thanks.
You were right about the landlady.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.589
Put her on the bench,
she cracked like an egg.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.399
I cracked her like a walnut.
She crumbled like blue cheese.

07:11.480 --> 07:15.075
- He should open a restaurant.
- How'd you get oatmeal on your shirt?

07:15.760 --> 07:19.275
Do me a favor, will you?
Help me with this shirt.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.829
Great.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.118
I hate to break up your aerobics class,
but this is important.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.715
- What is it, Blanchard?
- Logan, I need that 750 form.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.719
- Of course you do. What is it?
- 750?

07:32.880 --> 07:35.599
The monthly composite
of trials and verdicts.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.595
- Do you have it?
- No. No, I don't.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.759
- Okay.
- I filed an 822 instead.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.957
I know every form in every division
of the DA's office.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.793
I assure you there's no 822,
and I do know that.

07:48.880 --> 07:49.869
You got me.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.238
I'd like to see this form, 750,
on my desk by the end of the day.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.716
- You've got lunch with the chief today.
- I know. 12:30, his office.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.313
1:00 at Le Zinc.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.799
Right, 1:00. Le Zinc.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.350
- Marchek, who's the defense on that case?
- Laura J. Kelly.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.358
She once tried putting a dog
on the witness stand.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.275
Under oath?

08:12.200 --> 08:16.398
Mr. Marchek is a beloved member
of a very large, tight-knit family.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.518
We've brought forth two dozen cousins,
aunts, uncles, in-laws...

08:21.880 --> 08:26.271
...each of whom has testified under oath
that the alleged stolen property...

08:26.360 --> 08:29.432
...was given to Mr. Marchek
as birthday gifts by them.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.956
Fourteen of them chose to give him
a television set.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.477
An unlikely coincidence?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.710
Under normal circumstances, perhaps.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.032
But we all heard Mr. Marchek's
sworn testimony...

08:42.360 --> 08:44.715
...that all he wanted was a media room...

08:45.040 --> 08:48.112
...not unlike that of
the President of the United States.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.710
The prosecution has made
a big issue out of the fact...

08:51.960 --> 08:55.999
...that none of these relatives could
produce a receipt for the merchandise.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.196
A lovely watch. Do you have a receipt?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.070
No.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.754
- Clerk, arrest this man.
- Objection your honor.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.592
Defense is fondling a juror.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.715
Sustained.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.314
You're not a thief.
Neither is Howard Marchek.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.311
Receipts come, and receipts go.

09:09.760 --> 09:14.709
He did what any compassionate human
would've done in a situation like this.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.429
He offered a fellow citizen a fair deal.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.149
Are we to reward that kindness
with a jail term?

09:20.240 --> 09:22.151
For all our sakes, I hope not.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.955
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
please look into your hearts...

09:26.040 --> 09:28.508
...place yourselves in
Mr. Marchek's position...

09:28.600 --> 09:32.479
...and return a verdict of "not guilty."
Thank you.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.870
Before I begin my closing remarks,
I'd like to congratulate Miss Kelly...

09:43.960 --> 09:46.713
...on a defense which was
so entertaining and imaginative.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.473
I must confess,
I didn't know whether to refute it...

09:49.560 --> 09:51.710
...or give it a round of applause.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.759
But we're not in a theater here.
We're in a court of law.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.354
And in court we have
to deal with the facts.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.514
The defense says this was a birthday party.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.794
We've all been to birthday parties.
We've had our share of birthday presents.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.714
But all known generosity pales
when compared to the attention...

10:10.800 --> 10:14.349
...lavished on Mr. Marchek
by his adoring relatives.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.510
This must have been some birthday party.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.354
Detectives said they found TV sets,
stereos, microwaves, typewriters.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.635
Not the kind of variety you find at Sears...

10:24.720 --> 10:27.598
...but definitely selling
at much better prices.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.878
What about the Obitser arraignment?

10:29.960 --> 10:32.269
- I'll set the date.
- Mr. Logan.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.998
Twenty-seven relatives, birthday presents.
Were you serious?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.833
It was all I had.
It was the best possible defense.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.071
It should've never gone to court.
You should have pleaded guilty.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.709
Think of it this way: Every person,
guilty or innocent, deserves a defense.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.633
- It's in the Constitution.
- Why are you following me?

10:49.720 --> 10:52.314
I'd like you to talk to my client,
Chelsea Deardon.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.039
Chelsea Deardon.
I plan to talk to her, in court.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.633
I'm not talking about court.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.156
There are special circumstances
in the case. I'd like to brief you...

11:00.240 --> 11:04.631
If the evidence is compelling enough,
I'm sure the jury will agree. Excuse me.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.792
I'm trying to prevent
a miscarriage of justice.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.309
I'm talking about evidence
a jury may never have a chance to hear.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.910
You have a reputation for fairness.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.352
- Chelsea Deardon's a client I can believe in.
- Like Howard Marchek?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.349
That's it?

11:24.360 --> 11:27.591
- That's the entire extent of your curiosity?
- On the contrary.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.511
Twenty-seven relatives, a talking dog?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.558
I can't wait to see what's next.
See you in court.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.638
Clients of yours?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.391
You got to get that done this afternoon.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.113
Got it. Right.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.910
Tom.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.510
Tom.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.752
You got a handkerchief?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.478
You got a handkerchief?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.911
Yeah, sure. God.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.437
That is my table. I sit there every day.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.714
I'm sorry.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.596
- Tom, I need your legal opinion.
- Not now, I need to see Bowers.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.872
My client slams his truck
through the window of a 7-Eleven.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.838
He breaks a customer's leg,
bangs up the clerk with bruises.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.989
You got a problem.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.516
Okay look, my client is driving,
but he is also with a woman...

12:18.600 --> 12:21.672
...who's resting her head in his lap actively.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.320
What are you talking about?
Speak English, Ed.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.755
Resting her head with affection.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.954
This breaks his concentration
on driving, and...

12:31.440 --> 12:33.158
I can build a case on this.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.118
Ultimately, the accident is her fault
and not his.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.158
- What do you think?
- I'd sell the screen rights.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.233
A drink for you, sir?

12:45.760 --> 12:49.230
- Yeah. No.
- You're late. Cause me stress.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.319
Doctor says I'm supposed to
cut down on stress.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.989
These pills kill the acid in the coffee...

12:55.080 --> 12:57.548
...before the acid in the coffee kills me.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.991
Now let's get to the point here.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.595
You know, Tom,
I always had the highest regard for you...

13:06.640 --> 13:08.995
...both as a lawyer and a human being.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.993
I appreciate that.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.868
That's why I picked you to give the keynote
at the banquet tonight.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.350
Every year some poor son of a bitch
has to get in front of the crowd...

13:18.440 --> 13:20.396
...and spout comforting nonsense.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.917
This year, I want to hear it
from someone with style and charm.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.991
I want to hear it from someone
who's my choice...

13:29.120 --> 13:31.076
...for the next district attorney.

13:32.920 --> 13:33.796
You.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.595
Me?

13:39.280 --> 13:43.193
<i>This is finally it, folks,</i>
<i>my last year as your district attorney.</i>

13:45.800 --> 13:46.789
<i>Too late.</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:48.393
<i>Appeal denied.</i>

13:49.640 --> 13:52.359
<i>Now then, the big question is</i>
<i>who'll replace me?</i>

13:53.480 --> 13:56.517
<i>Well, perhaps someone</i>
<i>like our keynote speaker here.</i>

13:56.880 --> 13:59.110
<i>For the past 12 years, I've given this man...</i>

13:59.200 --> 14:02.476
<i>... the toughest assignments</i>
<i>and the heaviest case loads...</i>

14:02.560 --> 14:06.269
<i>... for one simple reason:</i>
<i>He gets thejob done!</i>

14:06.480 --> 14:07.993
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

14:08.520 --> 14:10.511
<i>... a man whose past performance...</i>

14:10.800 --> 14:14.395
<i>... guarantees him a brilliant future,</i>
<i>Tom Logan.</i>

14:25.240 --> 14:26.798
Chelsea, wait.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.077
Let's do something.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.956
I think this is better.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.276
Yeah. Much better.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.236
<i>An attorney has to know the truth.</i>

14:38.600 --> 14:40.716
<i>Whether he attacks it or defends it...</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:43.314
<i>... the truth is the touchstone of his trade.</i>

14:43.480 --> 14:46.677
<i>That's tricky, because clients often lie.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:51.629
<i>I don't know what it is about us, but...</i>

14:52.040 --> 14:55.510
<i>... it seems to be human nature,</i>
<i>to lie to a lawyer.</i>

14:56.280 --> 14:57.030
That him?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.680
<i>If your client was 5 miles away</i>
<i>from the crime scene...</i>

14:59.760 --> 15:01.990
<i>... he'd tell you he was 10 miles away.</i>

15:03.440 --> 15:07.672
<i>Nobody seems to trust a lawyer enough</i>
<i>to tell the truth.</i>

15:10.680 --> 15:11.999
<i>Because we are...</i>

15:12.880 --> 15:14.074
<i>... what we are...</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:16.548
<i>... and tend to...</i>

15:18.720 --> 15:20.995
<i>Because people lie so often to lawyers...</i>

15:21.120 --> 15:23.953
<i>... prosecuting attorneys</i>
<i>have to develop that instinct...</i>

15:24.040 --> 15:26.349
<i>... when it comes to determining the truth...</i>

15:26.480 --> 15:29.517
<i>... even when it turns out to be</i>
<i>against his best interests.</i>

15:30.320 --> 15:32.197
<i>He has to expose the truth.</i>

15:33.160 --> 15:35.435
<i>Now, that'sjustice.</i>

15:37.440 --> 15:39.396
<i>And that's why I'm an attorney.</i>

15:41.280 --> 15:42.349
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:49.752
We'll back you all the way.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.554
Kelly wants to file a cross-complaint
on the Deardon case. I told her no.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.200
She's threatened
to call a press conference.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.670
- What did you tell her?
- That you'd examine the cross-complaint.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.077
A quick investigation.
We don't need this kind of press.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.958
- I won't do it.
- Come on, Chelsea.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.720
<i>Moments ago, Laura J. Kelly,</i>
<i>a Manhattan attorney...</i>

16:21.800 --> 16:24.712
<i>... told us she plans to file charges</i>
<i>against the DA's office.</i>

16:24.800 --> 16:26.870
<i>Miss Kelly, can you tell us</i>
<i>what this is about?</i>

16:27.200 --> 16:30.158
<i>First, I'd like to apologize</i>
<i>for my conduct this evening.</i>

16:30.280 --> 16:32.510
She's doing it. She's doing it.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.472
<i>This young lady, Chelsea Deardon...</i>

16:35.560 --> 16:38.313
<i>... has been victimized</i>
<i>by some very unscrupulous people.</i>

16:38.400 --> 16:41.073
<i>We've tried to get cooperation</i>
<i>from the DA's office...</i>

16:41.160 --> 16:42.912
<i>... but they've been stonewalling us.</i>

16:43.000 --> 16:46.709
<i>We have no choice</i>
<i>but to file a cross-complaint against them.</i>

16:47.120 --> 16:50.112
<i>Here is Tom Logan</i>
<i>from the district attorney's office.</i>

16:50.400 --> 16:52.709
<i>What can you tell us about this?</i>

16:52.800 --> 16:55.997
<i>This is a total surprise to me.</i>
<i>I can assure you that...</i>

16:56.080 --> 16:59.516
<i>... if there's any implication of impropriety</i>
<i>on the part of our office...</i>

16:59.640 --> 17:01.596
<i>... why, it's unfounded.</i>

17:02.080 --> 17:05.550
<i>And I'll personally take charge</i>
<i>of this case from now on.</i>

17:06.160 --> 17:10.472
<i>I had no doubt that when a man</i>
<i>of Tom Logan's character and reputation...</i>

17:10.560 --> 17:12.993
<i>... found out about</i>
<i>the predicament of my client...</i>

17:13.079 --> 17:16.959
<i>... he would take quick and decisive action.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

17:20.000 --> 17:22.594
For the record
and so there's no misunderstandings...

17:22.680 --> 17:24.271
...you're entitled to remain silent.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.920
Anything you say
can and will be held against you.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.715
- Another attorney can be provided.
- No, I like her.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.079
Did you steal the painting?

17:33.160 --> 17:34.434
- No.
- Yes.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.709
Yes, but no.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.752
- Which is it?
- Both.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.470
This is a waste of time. I can feel it.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.518
I did try to take the painting,
but it already belonged to me.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.033
Can you prove that?

17:45.160 --> 17:47.594
My father gave me that painting
when I was eight.

17:47.680 --> 17:51.070
He even dedicated it to me
on the back in writing. Just look.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.916
Is there any other proof
that the painting belonged to you?

17:55.440 --> 17:57.078
My father kept a journal.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.638
You never told me about that.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.154
There were sketches
of that painting in the journal.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.118
On one he wrote
"For Chelsea's eighth birthday."

18:05.280 --> 18:07.111
I'd like to see the journal.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.192
It's in my apartment.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.438
You can come by any time.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.152
I'll be up there soon.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.399
Who did you steal it from?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.114
She didn't.
She allegedly stole the painting.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.715
From Robert Forrester, major developer.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.155
What were you doing at his place?

18:29.760 --> 18:32.194
His wife throws parties for young artists.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.590
That way people think she knows art.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.394
She's bored. She likes to wear earrings.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.037
- And what is the painting worth?
- $200,000.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.870
- Your father must've made a lot of money.
- I guess.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.796
- How much inheritance did you get?
- None.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.753
The estate was bankrupt.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.559
All unsold paintings
were destroyed in the fire...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.833
...including the one Chelsea allegedly stole.

19:03.960 --> 19:04.790
Okay.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.553
We'll look at the painting
and if there's an inscription...

19:08.640 --> 19:10.676
...l'll consider dropping the charges.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.749
Great.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.714
- Mr. Forrester.
- Come in.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.717
I'm afraid I can't show the Deardon to you,
Mr. Logan.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.799
I no longer own it.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.712
- I don't understand.
- I traded it yesterday.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.995
- Traded it to whom?
- To a gallery.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.868
Which gallery?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.399
Taft Gallery.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.314
That painting is material evidence
in a felony proceeding.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.229
Not anymore.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.518
I've decided to drop
all charges against Chelsea.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.709
- What?
- Why?

19:56.840 --> 19:58.956
Her father and I were good friends.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.788
Chelsea's had a difficult childhood.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.198
It's obvious to me she acted on impulse.
There was no harm done.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.759
And what did you receive
in return for the Deardon?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.712
A Picasso for a Deardon?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.351
I thought it was a good trade as well.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.759
This is good.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.194
So Taft didn't get a good trade?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.994
Not if he intends to stay in business.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.279
No offense, Logan,
but since I know something about art...

20:46.360 --> 20:49.079
...let me do the talking.
- Sure.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.435
Can I help you?

20:56.520 --> 21:00.274
Mr. Logan, Miss Kelly. We're here
to see Mr. Taft. He's expecting us.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.078
Yes. Wait here just one moment.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.199
Dubuffet.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.109
De Kooning.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.795
Calder.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.593
How about that?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.075
Mr. Logan?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.558
I'm Victor Taft.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.352
Thanks for calling. I have a busy schedule.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.317
We'll be brief. This is Miss Kelly.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.391
- Pleasure.
- Magnificent gallery.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.958
Do you have any Picassos around here
at this present time?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.588
Yes. You're standing right in front of one.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.190
Right.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.552
Right. That's expensive?

21:43.920 --> 21:46.150
Value is a relative thing, is it not?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.795
Come. Let me show you around.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.078
Picasso is one of the true masters
of this century.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.957
Yet you traded a Picasso...

22:00.040 --> 22:02.918
...for a Deardon,
which couldn't possibly be worth as much.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.110
That particular Deardon
was one of his last.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.668
A work of total confidence and maturity.

22:09.680 --> 22:13.309
Deardon was my discovery,
so I feel proprietary about his work.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.834
I pestered Forrester
to part with it for years.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.237
Frankly, I was thrilled
when he finally agreed.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.715
Let's set it on the stand.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.639
It's a Bertolini. Startling, isn't it?

22:29.720 --> 22:32.280
It was his model for a larger version.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.112
I bet the price's equally startling.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.237
It's not for sale.
It was given to me personally by the artist.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.992
It has great sentimental value.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.868
If you don't mind me asking, what's
your relationship with Chelsea Deardon?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.675
Her father and I were very close.
I watched little Chelsea grow up.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.116
Mr. Logan, you're leaning.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.070
Sorry.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.509
Recently, Chelsea and I have lost touch.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.473
Her sensibility in art doesn't interest me.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.353
She's a performance artist.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.830
- Happenings, very ephemeral experiences.
- She's what?

23:04.920 --> 23:07.559
- A performance artist.
- I hear she's quite talented.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.959
Thank you, Roger.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.113
It's very powerful.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.030
- It is.
- I'd like to see the other side.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.148
How refreshing.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.350
Most clients prefer to see the front.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.919
That was one of the shiftiest
performances I've seen.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.195
I thought he was pretty straightforward.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.272
What happened to the sixth sense
you're so famous for?

23:50.360 --> 23:53.875
- Doesn't it feel too neatly tied up?
- Kelly, it's dead.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.710
There's no signature.
The charges are dropped. It's done.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.197
- Can I get you a cab?
- I can get my own cab, thanks.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.151
God, give me a break.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.916
Okay.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.315
That's it.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.310
No.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.950
<i>- I couldn't let you do it.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

25:46.040 --> 25:48.952
<i>You wouldn't be seen.</i>
<i>You'd be throwing away your own career.</i>

25:49.040 --> 25:51.156
<i>It has nothing to do with my career.</i>

27:34.280 --> 27:35.872
Someone's following me.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.470
I'm scared. Can I come in?

27:39.560 --> 27:42.154
Sure. How did you know where I live?

27:42.280 --> 27:45.716
- I was afraid he'd follow me home.
- Who'd follow you home?

27:45.800 --> 27:47.677
- The man.
- What man?

27:47.840 --> 27:51.310
I don't know what man.
I've seen him three times today.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.873
Where is he now?

27:53.360 --> 27:55.032
Probably right out front.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.113
I don't see anybody.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.869
He's hiding.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.074
Chelsea, you can't stay here.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.197
Maybe a friend's house?

28:24.840 --> 28:26.398
I don't have a friend.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.630
Okay. I'll run you home.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.198
Hang on. I'll get dressed.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.918
Did you talk to Kelly?

29:04.680 --> 29:05.669
Earlier.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.430
So you know there's no signature
on the back of that painting?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.439
You're sure Taft showed you
the right painting?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.871
Are you familiar enough
with my father's work...

29:23.680 --> 29:25.557
...to tell one from another?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.599
Won't you come in?

30:09.800 --> 30:10.676
Okay.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.793
- Lot of room.
- Yes.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.194
What's all this?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.552
Something I'm working on.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.593
Let me show you.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.515
<i>Sit down.</i>

31:12.080 --> 31:14.071
<i>Heart's desire, heart's desire.</i>

31:14.240 --> 31:16.549
<i>Never, never play with fire.</i>

31:21.920 --> 31:23.239
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

31:42.960 --> 31:44.313
<i>Old flame.</i>

31:51.200 --> 31:53.077
<i>I was driving down the highway.</i>

31:53.160 --> 31:56.630
<i>I saw a car burning on the side of the road.</i>

31:57.080 --> 31:59.230
<i>A woman was slumped over the wheel.</i>

32:00.040 --> 32:04.113
<i>Her shoulders were shaking,</i>
<i>like she was crying.</i>

32:15.640 --> 32:16.868
<i>Brush.</i>

32:24.720 --> 32:26.039
<i>Brush fire.</i>

32:33.000 --> 32:36.595
<i>Through the windshield,</i>
<i>on the hood of the car, there was a stack.</i>

32:37.280 --> 32:39.157
<i>Maybe it was a small child.</i>

32:39.640 --> 32:42.552
<i>As I drove by,</i>
<i>I noticed that nobody stopped.</i>

32:47.120 --> 32:48.519
<i>Nobody stopped.</i>

32:48.960 --> 32:50.313
<i>Neither did I.</i>

32:50.800 --> 32:52.199
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

32:52.360 --> 32:54.476
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

32:55.200 --> 32:56.189
<i>Fire.</i>

32:56.800 --> 33:00.270
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

33:00.360 --> 33:02.351
<i>Put out, put out.</i>

33:04.360 --> 33:06.032
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

33:06.120 --> 33:07.314
<i>Fire!</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:10.119
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:14.913
What did you think?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.116
I...

33:30.320 --> 33:31.355
...think...

33:33.200 --> 33:34.155
...fine.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.117
What did you think?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.155
I think...

33:51.440 --> 33:53.112
I think I'm uncomfortable.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.311
- Good.
- Good?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.515
Yeah, good.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.997
That's what I'm trying to do:
Challenge your perspective.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.038
Make you uncomfortable.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.558
Still uncomfortable?

34:25.239 --> 34:26.434
You bet.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.436
You said your father had a journal?

34:37.960 --> 34:39.279
Can I see it?

34:43.080 --> 34:44.478
- Yeah.
- Now?

34:45.760 --> 34:47.239
I'd have to find it.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.397
It shouldn't take too long.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.155
Maybe it's in the storeroom. I forget.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.392
When was the last time you saw it?

35:00.520 --> 35:02.988
- Two weeks ago.
- There's no journal, is there?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.275
- Yes, there is.
- But you don't have it?

35:07.920 --> 35:12.152
- Do you always cross-examine people?
- Only when they lie.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.428
I have nothing from when father was alive.

35:29.080 --> 35:33.153
There was a journal. There were paintings.
There was a fire.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.832
I need your help.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.276
I lied to you before because...

35:43.320 --> 35:45.880
...I didn't think the truth was good enough.

35:48.800 --> 35:49.949
He's there.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.554
- What?
- He's there.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.268
- No one's there.
- I feel it.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.591
- I need some sleep.
- You can sleep here.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.919
If there's trouble, call the police.
911, emergency.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.190
Thanks for taking me home.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.911
Something interesting up there?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.435
<i>This is Laura Kelly.</i>
<i>I can't come to the phone...</i>

37:46.520 --> 37:48.556
<i>... so leave your message at the tone...</i>

37:52.840 --> 37:54.239
Get me the police.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.751
Miss Kelly, I need to talk to you.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.713
Office hours are 9:00 to 5:00.
My number's in the book.

38:05.400 --> 38:09.359
I'm with the police.
My name is C.J. Cavanaugh.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.431
I'm a detective. Manhattan South.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.469
Just a minute.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.394
- You have ID?
- Yes, ma'am.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.629
Show it.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.751
Yeah, that's ID.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.349
Come on in.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.714
- What's this about?
- The Deardon case.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.676
There is no Deardon case.
The charges were dropped yesterday.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.193
Wrong Deardon case.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.070
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- I'll sit with you.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.120
Seventeen years ago,
I headed an investigation...

39:11.200 --> 39:13.395
...into the murder of Sebastian Deardon.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.550
- Murder?
- Murder.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.791
Could you excuse me?

39:25.520 --> 39:28.990
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.435
- Can I get you something?
- No, no!

39:39.400 --> 39:41.197
I read that case record.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.870
There was nothing about murder.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.996
You read the whitewash.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.990
My report got filed in someone's
wastebasket down at City Hall.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.149
Seventeen years ago...

39:51.240 --> 39:54.198
...I pushed too hard on the case
with the captain in charge.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.316
Suddenly, I'm busting winos.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.189
What do you want me to do?

40:02.720 --> 40:04.597
I want you to read this.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.633
You're the Deardon girl's lawyer.
I hear you're curious.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.233
Just read it.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.638
If you need more, I can get it.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.438
Is this stolen material?

40:16.120 --> 40:18.873
If it's stolen,
you didn't get it from me, right?

40:19.480 --> 40:22.040
- Try some tomato juice.
- Right.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.636
Watson, have you seen Tom Logan?

40:33.720 --> 40:37.076
Not since he buried me in court.
I'm not looking for him either.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.149
Okay.

40:38.560 --> 40:42.439
- Thompson, where's Logan?
- I'm late, unprepared, and doomed!

40:42.520 --> 40:46.195
- I need Logan!
- He's in courtroom seven or six.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.518
- You were having sex with him.
- No.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.514
- I see.
- We have to talk.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.150
- You don't deny it?
- On the contrary. I just denied it.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.112
Miss Kelly.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.197
Today is my birthday
and things are going so well.

41:03.600 --> 41:07.149
- Are you going to spoil my birthday?
- Happy birthday, your Honor.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.155
Begging the court's indulgence,
could I confer with Mr. Logan?

41:11.640 --> 41:14.837
- Mr. Rustavlov?
- No objection, your honor.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.672
Get on with it.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.600
I called you last night.
Something incredible happened.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.399
I'll say. I discovered that...
You called me?

41:22.480 --> 41:23.708
Yeah. What discovery?

41:23.800 --> 41:26.792
The Deardon case: Major fraud.
I've got hard evidence.

41:28.680 --> 41:32.036
Your Honor,
an important matter has come up.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.873
My learned assistant, Miss Freeman...

41:35.000 --> 41:37.309
...will continue the cross-examination.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.435
What? Me?

41:38.560 --> 41:40.551
What about this hard evidence?

41:43.400 --> 41:46.710
It's a complete collection
of Sebastian Deardon's paintings.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.079
This is a confidential insurance file.
Where'd you get it?

41:50.160 --> 41:51.354
I have my sources.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.909
Notice the red stamps
near most of the paintings?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.992
These were destroyed in the fire.
Look at 122.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.399
Look familiar?

42:01.160 --> 42:03.594
This looks like the painting Taft showed us.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.991
Not looks like. It is. Notice the stamp?

42:07.080 --> 42:09.958
This painting was supposedly
destroyed in the fire.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.835
- I say we squeeze him.
- Squeeze? No.

42:23.720 --> 42:26.678
We'll go slow with him.
I don't want to hear the word, fraud.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.911
No matter what we have,
the whole thing could be a clerical error.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.956
A $20 million clerical error?

42:32.400 --> 42:34.516
I'm here with no authority whatsoever.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.512
You're in possession of insurance files
of dubious origin.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.431
Inside, I'll do the talking.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.189
Stay behind me
and try to look like an attorney.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.833
Yes, your Holiness.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.551
At $2,700,000 on the right side.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.711
Now at $2,700,000. Now say 8.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.072
$2,800,000 on the aisle.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.990
At $2,800,000. Now say 9.

42:56.280 --> 42:59.670
At $2,800,000
on the left aisle and fair warning...

42:59.880 --> 43:01.791
...at $2,800,000.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.634
Sold for $2,800,000.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.396
That's for number 176.

43:08.720 --> 43:12.793
Your next lot is number 12.
Lot 12, the Renoir.

43:12.920 --> 43:16.117
Mr. Taft, I'd like to ask
a few more questions about the Deardon.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.515
I'm pursuing an elusive painting...

43:18.640 --> 43:21.871
I'm sorry to bother you. Excuse me.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.240
A colleague of mine
received some documents...

43:27.680 --> 43:30.797
...related to art underwriting
by Seaboard Fidelity Company.

43:30.920 --> 43:32.399
Please, I'm busy.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.074
Not as many Deardons
were destroyed in the fire...

43:35.160 --> 43:36.878
...as previously thought.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.438
$1,300,000.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.829
Gentleman's bid at $1,300,000.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.595
- I have $1,300,000 on the left.
- Go to $1.8.

43:45.680 --> 43:49.434
$1,400,000. I have $1,400,000.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.034
I have $1,400,000. Now 5.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.795
Five, $1,500,000.
The gentleman at the back.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.313
$1,500,000. Now 6.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.233
I carried Chelsea through the flames.
I saved her life.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.311
Everything else burned to the ground.

44:02.400 --> 44:05.676
The Deardon you showed us yesterday
managed to survive.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.991
That's it. Get out,
before I have you thrown out.

44:09.400 --> 44:12.597
- We're not making allegations...
- We know those paintings exist.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.398
We think you have them.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.995
If you repeat that allegation anywhere,
publicly or privately...

44:20.520 --> 44:23.159
...l'll see you never practice law
in this country.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.437
That won't be necessary.
I apologize for Miss Kelly's allegations...

44:26.520 --> 44:29.318
...but I do represent the DA's office.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.597
I'd like to see your business records.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.638
So if you cooperate,
we can avoid any further unpleasantness.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.631
You seem intelligent, Mr. Logan.

44:36.960 --> 44:39.269
Far too intelligent to risk a career...

44:39.360 --> 44:42.955
...by meddling in legitimate matters
which aren't your concern.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.992
Am I making myself clear?

44:46.520 --> 44:47.669
Perfectly.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.710
You'll be subpoenaed in the morning.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.473
I want all your records
for the past five years:

44:54.640 --> 44:57.837
Shipping orders, inventories,
bills of sale, the works.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.913
Otherwise, a federal marshal
will confiscate them...

45:01.000 --> 45:02.991
...and you'll be subject to arrest.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.034
Is that clear?

45:05.840 --> 45:08.149
- 'Bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Taft.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.713
"Those paintings exist,
and we believe you have them."

45:12.800 --> 45:17.510
- Didn't you learn anything in law school?
- Yeah, but we really shook him up.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.912
- That look in your eyes at the end.
- What?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.718
Pure blue steel.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.395
- What?
- I'd like to develop one.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.028
You don't develop looks. You just look.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.434
Not me. I practice looks in the mirror.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.950
- I picked one up from you.
- What?

45:35.120 --> 45:38.476
I'm cross-examining someone and
I get an answer I don't believe...

45:38.560 --> 45:40.073
...this is what you do.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.878
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.359
- I don't do that.
- All the time.

45:46.440 --> 45:47.759
Come on.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.959
You stand by the jury, give a quarter-turn,
then give that exact look.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.318
I saw it,
you totally discredited Van Dyke with it.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.710
Van Dyke? You were in the courtroom?

45:57.800 --> 46:01.076
Some people go to ballgames.
I go to court.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.838
Do you have the keys?

46:11.320 --> 46:12.196
Yeah.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.149
Hang on.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.233
I'll be right back.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.512
Where did you learn this?

46:25.640 --> 46:28.154
I used to... Never mind.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.310
You can't always get it at first.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.159
Well, you're closer.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.995
Much closer. There, you got it.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.757
It's Taft.

46:45.560 --> 46:48.472
- Sure seems to be in a hurry.
- Yeah.

46:55.920 --> 46:59.515
- Logan, don't lose him.
- I won't. Where did he go?

46:59.680 --> 47:01.318
Right up there.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.273
Just up ahead.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.994
Not that car. It's the gray Mercedes.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.758
The idea is not to get too close.

47:09.920 --> 47:13.674
- That's the idea?
- Hurry, but don't get too close.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.513
Ease back a little. That's it.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.153
You're doing good.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.589
Okay.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.792
Pull over to the right
so we can make a right-hand turn.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.270
Can you do that?

47:28.000 --> 47:31.436
What are you doing? Logan. Get back in.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.351
- You drive.
- No.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.271
You seem to know what to do.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.555
You're doing great. Get back in the car.

47:37.640 --> 47:40.791
- It's your turn, really. Drive.
- I can't.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.435
- What?
- I can't drive.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.878
The light's changing.

48:26.920 --> 48:30.071
- Let's...
- Don't even say it. Don't even think it.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.629
You've got a lot of enthusiasm
and that may not be bad, but...

48:35.000 --> 48:37.594
...if we go in there,
it's breaking and entering.

48:37.720 --> 48:40.553
It's not breaking, it's entering.
There's no law against that.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.950
- There are hundreds of them.
- Not for an official pursuing a felon.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.116
No. He's not a felon.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.158
Pursuing a probable felon.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.792
Probable felon.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.390
"Boston vs. Cavalero, 1967.

48:53.560 --> 48:56.677
"If a public official
is pursuing a probable felon...

48:56.760 --> 49:00.389
"...he or she may enter an unlocked
storage area without a warrant...

49:00.480 --> 49:04.314
"...when there's reasonable suspicion
of unlawful activities therein."

49:05.600 --> 49:07.477
Boston vs...

49:10.160 --> 49:11.388
Come here.

49:12.840 --> 49:13.909
Come here.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.838
I'm just taking a peek.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.914
An open door is practically an invitation.

49:25.080 --> 49:29.392
I can cite cases where implied invitation
is a valid reason to enter.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.398
- In a building with a security...
- Do you hear something?

49:33.720 --> 49:35.790
It's Taft. Coming, Victor.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.952
He invited you, too.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.948
Jesus.

51:01.640 --> 51:05.519
I don't want to blur your concentration,
but we're locked in.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.430
- What's all this flammable stuff?
- Look at this.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.478
Here's the business records we wanted.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.318
Letters of incorporation dated 1962.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.158
Three-man partnership.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.239
Triad Enterprises.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.158
Victor Taft, counseling.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.229
Victor Taft, Robert Forrester,
Joseph Brock.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.754
- Brock?
- Taft and Forrester were partners.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.274
No wonder they traded
that painting so quickly.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.271
Deardon's name is everywhere.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.278
Joseph Brock.
What the hell happened to him?

51:37.120 --> 51:39.554
His name disappeared in 1962.

51:44.160 --> 51:46.993
Here's the insurance payoffs
on the Deardon paintings.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.275
What's that sound, your watch?

51:49.360 --> 51:50.475
No.

51:50.560 --> 51:53.757
Victor Taft and Robert Forrester
were co-beneficiaries.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.472
Do something.

52:00.640 --> 52:03.712
Hold it. Move. Let's go.

52:08.080 --> 52:09.752
Here. Down here!

52:37.480 --> 52:39.630
- Jump!
- Jump?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.194
Are you all right?

53:24.280 --> 53:26.111
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.359
You all right?

53:36.960 --> 53:39.520
I don't ever want to do this again.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.799
Never again.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.917
Make out a warrant
for Taft's arrest for arson.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.514
I think you should know
the chief is totally crazed.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.348
He's popping those little pills like M&Ms.

53:51.640 --> 53:55.315
He almost let the police charge you both
with breaking and entering.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.675
He's probably never heard of Boston vs...

53:57.760 --> 53:59.273
- Cavalero.
- Right.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.511
Make sure the detective squad hires
some art experts...

54:04.680 --> 54:06.557
...to sift through the wreckage.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.471
- Art experts.
- Yeah.

54:08.640 --> 54:11.029
How'd the trial go? Did you win it?

54:11.160 --> 54:12.957
I don't want to talk about it.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.996
- Hey, Miss Kelly.
- Cavanaugh.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.830
Are you okay? I heard all about it.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.150
Must have been a hell of a bang.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.192
I'm talking to the lady.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.277
I'm listening to you talk to the lady.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.510
- Who is this guy?
- Who is this guy?

54:27.440 --> 54:28.873
C.J. Cavanaugh, detective.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.679
This is Tom Logan,
Assistant District Attorney.

54:35.440 --> 54:39.558
- This is supposed to be between us.
- We're doing this together.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.200
- Doing what together?
- It's just an expression.

54:42.280 --> 54:45.556
Detective Cavanaugh investigated
the original Deardon fire.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.236
You know something about the case?

54:48.440 --> 54:50.396
Yeah, I know something about it.

54:50.840 --> 54:54.196
What about this partnership
between Taft and Forrester and...

54:54.640 --> 54:56.312
- Brock.
- Brock, yeah.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.476
There's not much to tell.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.589
The three partners were cooking the books.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.199
Phony tax records.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.759
IRS starts sniffing around.

55:05.880 --> 55:09.316
Taft and Forrester set up Joe Brock
to take the fall.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.599
Brock was in jail
when Deardon was murdered.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.718
- Murdered?
- The way I see it.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.512
What happened to Brock?

55:19.360 --> 55:21.271
Brock was not a lucky man.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.958
He got cancer after his release from prison.

55:25.160 --> 55:28.118
Buried in Kansas City in 1972.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.589
That's it?

55:32.280 --> 55:33.998
Yeah, that's it, for now.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.318
I do something for you...

55:36.920 --> 55:39.559
...you do something for me.
That's my home phone number.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.915
If you come up with anything, call me.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.149
Snow. That's...

55:55.320 --> 55:59.233
I'm having dinner with my daughter.
Want to join us? You hungry?

55:59.480 --> 56:02.233
- I have a date.
- A what?

56:03.240 --> 56:04.309
A date.

56:04.560 --> 56:07.791
You know, where a man
invites a woman out and they...

56:07.880 --> 56:10.713
I know. I'm just wondering...

56:11.640 --> 56:15.155
- Are you in any kind of condition to...
- Pardon me?

56:15.240 --> 56:18.152
You look a little... Forget it.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.355
Logan...

56:25.280 --> 56:27.840
...if there's anything at all
about me you like...

56:27.920 --> 56:30.480
...could you tell me what that is right now?

56:37.360 --> 56:38.759
I like your eyes.

56:40.960 --> 56:42.029
Yeah?

56:44.080 --> 56:45.559
They're very warm eyes.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.468
Thank you.

56:48.920 --> 56:50.876
- Cold ears.
- Very cold.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.871
- Want a lift?
- Yes.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.079
May I come in?

58:21.480 --> 58:23.072
Don't ever be a lawyer.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.391
Everybody hates lawyers.

58:27.560 --> 58:31.599
When you get to be district attorney
do you have to go into politics?

58:32.560 --> 58:34.391
I'm already in politics.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.068
Politics is more than running for elections.

58:38.400 --> 58:43.394
Politics should be the wise exercise,
distribution, and maintenance of power.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.077
Then what's sexual politics?

58:50.280 --> 58:51.793
Sexual politics?

58:55.320 --> 58:57.311
Well, that's when you have...

58:58.720 --> 59:00.711
Sex is...

59:01.360 --> 59:02.713
If two...

59:04.240 --> 59:07.516
Is it like when you call a boy,
but he won't call you...

59:07.600 --> 59:09.238
...because he's too cool...

59:09.480 --> 59:11.550
...so you call him to tell him he's cool.

59:11.640 --> 59:15.633
He tells everyone you like him,
but he doesn't have to say he likes you.

59:18.840 --> 59:21.991
Well then, politics is
just getting what you want?

59:26.480 --> 59:28.630
Wait a minute. What have we got here?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.078
I did something crazy.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.957
- I went to Victor's with a gun.
- A gun?

59:42.560 --> 59:43.675
Come in.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.756
I wanted to know
where my father's paintings were.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.230
He knocked me around.
He took the gun away.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.754
I got panicky. He hit me.
I managed to get out.

59:54.600 --> 59:57.160
- Did you call Kelly?
- Yes. Her machine was on.

59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.789
Victor said he'd call the police.
I'm really scared.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.511
We've got to get you dry.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.876
You can use the bathroom.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.277
- This is my daughter, Jennifer.
- Hi.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.229
It's okay.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.717
She looks guilty to me, Dad.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.509
A juror doesn't make a determination
until he has all the evidence.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.270
Will I get to know her really well?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.918
No, but you still have to be
on your best behavior.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.792
You, too. Right, Dad?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.796
Hold it. It might be the police.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.592
Why are you protecting her?
She's your girlfriend, isn't she?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.590
No.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.994
Look who's here. What a surprise.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.992
- Hi, Mom. We thought you were the cops.
- What?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.471
- She's ready. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.433
What's the matter with you guys?
You're acting...

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.279
In front of the kid?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.838
Nothing happened in front of the child.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.196
Dad didn't hit her in the face.
It was a guy she robbed with a gun.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.668
Thanks.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.114
Congratulations.
Perfect environment to raise my daughter.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.393
- She's our daughter. Don't forget it.
- I'm trying to forget that.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.637
I'll make sure she knows
you didn't do anything.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.870
- 'Bye.
- Be good.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.238
What do you want, Ed?

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.437
It's none of your business.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.638
- I screwed things up for you, didn't I?
- Forget it.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.555
- I'm always doing that.
- Forget it.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.233
- Mind if I make myself some tea?
- No, I'll make... I'll call Kelly.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.635
<i>Hi. This is Laura Kelly.</i>
<i>Leave your message...</i>

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.073
First thing in the morning, you'll call Kelly.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.832
Then you're gonna file a report
with the police.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.430
Why can't you come with me?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.517
Why? Because...

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.355
Because she's your attorney. I'm not.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.719
Personal question?

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.352
What do you think of me?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.514
Interesting.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.276
The other night when I kissed you...

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.551
...what did you think of that?

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.239
Dangerous.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.311
That's a carefully chosen word.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.677
Carefully chosen words are the tools
of my profession.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.752
I think you've got everything here.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.035
This has been such a complicated day.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.271
Let's hope everything's fine.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.989
See you in the morning.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.517
Freeze! Hold it! Don't move!

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.160
You have the right to remain silent...

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.158
- Who are you?
- Freeze! Don't move again.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.708
Hey, guys! What the hell's happening?

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.395
Chelsea Deardon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Victor Taft.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.357
Murder! It's not true!

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.675
Anything you say can be held against you.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.389
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Looks like she already had her attorney.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.357
Get your clothes on, pal.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.596
Were you in bed with the suspect?

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.394
They're calling you the darling DA.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.559
Our clairvoyant at <i>World's People</i> says
Chelsea's carrying your child.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.995
The police said you were both naked.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.435
Do you usually examine suspects this way?

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.433
One year!

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.669
I had one more year.
Now what will they remember?

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.592
The 67,000 convictions I got?

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.910
No, they'll remember one horny bastard...

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.070
...who made my office a laughingstock.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.276
When we service this community...

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.191
...we do it with our pants on!

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.118
Who sent the cops to my place?
Who knew Chelsea was there?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.873
- An anonymous caller.
- Most anonymous calls are ignored.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.873
Most anonymous calls don't involve
an assistant district attorney.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.476
I'm shot at, my suspect blows up
a building and then gets killed.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.198
Somebody's setting me up.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.433
I have no alternative.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.034
You're suspended
for 90 days pending investigation.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.075
What?

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.635
Suspend me?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.710
That's a cheap, political dodge.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.314
Suspend me when I need your support?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:19.876
No.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.950
You're right. I'm not going to suspend you.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.315
- Don't say it.
- You're fired.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.317
You can't do that. I won't accept it.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.992
- You're fired!
- I quit!

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.911
- You what?
- I quit. 'Bye.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.189
You what?

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.110
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- What about it?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.668
Nothing. The press gave you a raw deal.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.513
This subpoena demands you show cause...

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.955
...why you're inhibiting
your daughter's education.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.474
Your former wife has brought charges.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.554
You may bring legal counsel to the hearing.
Give 'em hell.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.915
You want to play rough?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.356
Want to find out how good a lawyer I am?
Well, you got it.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.955
By the time I finish,
I'll cut you into legal pieces.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.952
Jennifer. Hi, sweetie.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.518
No. I'm fine. I'm good.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.353
I'm angry, that's all. Is Mom there?

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.958
When she gets out of the tub,
tell her I called.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.470
Great. Okay. Fine.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.554
I love you, too. 'Bye.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.634
- Sorry, boss. Elliott Blanchard...
- Not you.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.795
Not now.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.515
I was just checking out the office.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.353
It's my office until I clean out my desk.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.077
Wouldn't listen, would you?

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.870
Everything had to be done your way.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.834
You're history.
I'll talk to you later, Doreen.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.475
What?

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.273
What happened?

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.073
I can't discuss it now.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.913
There's an excellent account in the <i>Post</i>.
Bit lurid, but highly provocative.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:28.469
I read the <i>Post</i>.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.073
So you know, or think you know.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.798
You tell me otherwise.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.714
Tell me you didn't sleep with my client.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.270
- Damn it.
- Damn it? Is that what you said?

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:47.188
Yes, damn it, Logan.
Why did you sleep with her?

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.999
Did you have to make
your conquest public?

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.752
Right. It's my mistake.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.990
I should have kicked her out
into the street.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.959
I made the mistake and I'll pay for it...
Me, Tom Logan.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.437
Ex-Assistant District Attorney.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.913
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.636
Don't. Don't ever help me again. Please.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.877
It's obvious that you're being set up.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.350
We both know Chelsea was framed.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.959
This trumped up murder charge
is more of the same.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.794
A person is entitled to his or her opinion.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.631
Lawyers have to prove them in court.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.758
- I can prove it.
- Yeah?

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.559
I could prove it.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.510
Especially if I had help from someone...

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.795
...that knew as much about it as I did.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.233
- What are you saying?
- Someone...

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.393
...that would greatly benefit
by Chelsea's acquittal.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.193
- No.
- Just for this one case, Logan.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.635
You'd get your job back,
and I'd be on my way.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.675
You get one side of the desk.
I get the other.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.797
You have three drawers on your side.
I have three on mine.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.632
We can share the center one.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.950
I'll put the phone right in the middle.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.630
My side will be very messy.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.635
I like it like that way
so don't try to straighten it up.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.709
All right.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.950
Can we discuss Chelsea's defense?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.439
Well, in my opinion...

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.637
...we have to cloud the issues,
get the focus off Chelsea.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.679
We have two witnesses.
How can we discredit them?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.478
Do they have criminal records?

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.030
Do they pay their bills,
parking tickets, bounced checks?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.037
You know, what kind of people are they?

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.396
Any old trick to get the client off?

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.075
You're a defense attorney now.
You're supposed to get the client off.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.711
I'll need more room here.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.752
I've got to have room to pace.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.554
I'm a pacer.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.196
Can we get down to basics now?

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.596
Is she guilty? Do we think she killed Taft?

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.797
- She is capable of killing.
- I don't think she killed Taft.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.115
Everything's based
on circumstantial evidence.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.998
Absolutely.
We don't have to disprove anything.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.877
- We just have to cast doubt.
- Right.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.035
Right.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.515
There's one more important issue here.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.395
What?

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.475
Are you going to sleep
with our client again?

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.350
- What has that got to do with the trial?
- Everything.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.638
- She's a very attractive young girl.
- Extremely attractive.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.234
I didn't say extremely,
I said just attractive.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.799
Extremely.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.678
- She has a nice body.
- A sensational body.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.990
I'll pick the adjectives. A good body.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.874
Big eyes.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.073
- Hypnotic.
- Big eyes.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.670
- Unforgettable.
- Are you going to sleep with her again?

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.436
No.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.275
Good.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.951
That's all I wanted to know.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.317
All rise. The Supreme Court
for the State of New York...

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.470
...is now in session.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.479
The honorable judge
John Dawkins is presiding.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.879
Please be seated.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.234
The case for the people of New York vs.
Chelsea Deardon is ready for arraignment.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.756
Counsel and defendant are both present.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.115
Regarding this change of venue...

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.313
...does defense wish
to engage in oral argument?

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.998
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.948
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.268
Which is it?

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.998
- No, we don't.
- Of course.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.316
We move for a change of venue
due to misleading exposure in the press.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.710
- I object.
- You object to your own co-counsel?

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.468
I do, yes.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.189
I see.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.758
Would counsel approach the bench, please?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.673
Is this the way things will be?

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.394
Everyone in New York
has read about this case.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.435
- You know someplace looser morally?
- I'm addressing His Honor.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.750
Flip a coin to decide who'll speak...

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.476
Enough already. Motion is denied.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.794
Does defense wish to enter a plea?

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.434
Yes, Chelsea Deardon pleads "not guilty."

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.911
Your plea is noted. Call the next case.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.030
The State of New York
vs. Christian Clemenson.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.352
You're a good typist.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.190
I thought I'd need something
to fall back on...

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.396
...in case I didn't finish law school.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.676
- Dad's a terrible typist.
- I've noticed.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.398
- But he has his good points.
- Yeah.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.430
You guys like each other, don't you?

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.435
Yeah.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.072
I see the way you look at each other.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.590
I like the way he moves.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.592
Yeah, until he trips over something, right?

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.308
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.355
- Are there any calls?
- Just Mom. She's on her way over.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.757
- Dad?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.914
I had a talk with Mom
and got her to cancel the subpoena.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.471
How did you get her to do that?

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.200
I told her you said I could go to California.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.349
What?

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.832
But you get to pick me up on June 1,
in LA and keep me for 60...

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.558
...90 consecutive days.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.397
What do you know about this?

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.433
Did you do this?

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.359
You did this.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.278
You thought I'd buy the deal?

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.033
Now, you have her four days a month,
48 days a year.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.271
- I got you 42 more days.
- That's almost double, Dad.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.475
I can add.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.154
That's Mom.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.075
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.716
Here, take this, this time.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.075
Dad?

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.030
So what do I tell her?

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.073
She's got a deal.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.628
- Okay.
- 'Bye.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.035
'Bye.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.238
You guys are a great team.
You have a lot in common.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.309
- What's she mean "a lot in common"?
- I don't know.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.470
Earlier, she said you liked me.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.919
She's just a kid.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.157
She's a pretty bright kid.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.997
You have the case load.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.998
- You're going to bring that.
- You have the trial notes?

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.752
Bring them over tomorrow.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.711
- All right.
- Good night.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.635
All right.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.513
- That was nice.
- Yes, it was.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.034
See you tomorrow.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.148
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.830
...we, the people,
will prove beyond a reasonable doubt...

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.236
...that on the night of October 7,
Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon...

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.711
...did commit the crime of murder
against one Victor Taft.

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.992
That, with intent to cause
the death of Victor Taft...

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.914
...she shot him in the chest three times.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.716
We'll call witnesses
who'll testify under oath to seeing...

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.631
...Chelsea Deardon flee the scene.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.073
Ballistics will prove...

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.914
...the gun was registered
to Chelsea Deardon.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.399
And most important...

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.713
...her fingerprints were all over that gun.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.114
We'll prove Chelsea Deardon
was at the scene of the crime...

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.432
...had the means to commit a crime
and had every opportunity to do so.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.077
Opportunity and means:

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.309
Crucial evidence which, by themselves,
could establish guilt...

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.834
...beyond a reasonable doubt
in a murder case.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.869
But we will also provide
a compelling motive as well.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.711
This was a crime committed by a woman...

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.037
...who was secretly Victor Taft's
lover for two years...

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.477
...during which time he was
her only means of financial support.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.629
It's been one lie after another.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.472
We looked like incompetent idiots.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.438
Why didn't you tell us about it?
Thought you could hide it?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.999
It wasn't common knowledge.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.036
We never went out in public together.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.588
If you knew,
it would make me look more guilty.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.917
You went to his apartment,
you had a fight and killed him!

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.228
No! I didn't!

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.472
We fought, but I didn't kill him.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.630
You shot Taft, went to Logan's apartment...

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.790
...and involved him
so he'd clear everything.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.599
I went there because I was scared.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.676
Why don't you believe me?
I didn't kill anyone.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.513
That's the most preposterous explanation
I've ever heard.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.828
Yeah, it is.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.629
- I believe her.
- What?

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.079
Based on her track record so far?

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.471
No, hunch. Instinct.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.519
Let's hope it's coming
from above the waist.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.072
I believe her, too.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.311
Okay, she's telling the truth.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.270
You ready to do some tap dancing?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.952
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chelsea Deardon didn't kill Victor Taft.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.838
The prosecution has suggested
a possible motive...

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.879
...but one based on hearsay, conjecture
and circumstantial evidence.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.878
Evidence that appears
to have some substance...

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.077
...but upon closer examination...

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.392
...will prove to have no relevance
whatsoever to this case.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.190
You're not buying this, are you?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.474
You're not listening to a word I'm saying.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.031
Guess what? I don't blame you.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.997
After listening to Mr. Blanchard lay out
the prosecution's evidence...

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.276
...even I'm convinced
my client murdered Victor Taft.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.912
After all, if I had found
Victor Taft dead on the floor...

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.919
...and Chelsea Deardon's
fingerprints on the weapon...

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.152
...there isn't much that would convince me
she isn't guilty.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.879
Look. Let's save ourselves a lot of time.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.517
Let's be honest.
There are better things we could be doing.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.114
Who thinks Chelsea Deardon's guilty?

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.272
Objection your honor.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.989
Mr. Logan.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.230
Don't hold back. My hand is raised.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.232
I believe my client murdered
Victor Taft in cold blood.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.958
Isn't everybody convinced?

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.270
- Mr. Logan.
- Who agrees with me?

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.078
- I object!
- Mr. Logan.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.116
- You're convinced, right?
- Your Honor.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.839
- Your Honor!
- Prosecution says she's guilty.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.117
The jury says she's guilty.
Let's save the State of New York...

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.112
...a lot of time and money
and move directly to sentencing.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.234
- What?
- Isn't she entitled to a fair trial?

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.236
Let's give her one and then convict her.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.469
Mr. Logan!

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.075
You are totally out of order! You know it!

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.912
This jury is disqualified.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.436
Let's take a recess
while I consider holding you in contempt.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.318
I recognize my opening remarks
are irregular...

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.994
...but, please, let me continue
even though the jury...

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.868
...may consider my client guilty
at this time, I still believe in this jury...

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.437
...and will accept their final verdict,
whatever it might be.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.033
I concur, Your Honor.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.513
Prosecution has equal faith
in this jury, Your Honor.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.553
May I proceed?

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.435
Very well. You may proceed, Mr. Logan.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.312
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.239
So we all think she's guilty.
What do we do?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.151
That's a dilemma, isn't it?

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.790
A problem because we've developed...

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.792
...a legal concept in this country
to protect ourselves...

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.832
...to protect our rights...

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.393
...and it's called,
"presumption of innocence."

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.274
In simpler words that means
that one is presumed innocent...

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.952
...until proven guilty.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.433
That means that whatever
assumptions you've already made...

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.159
...Chelsea Deardon must be seen
in your eyes...

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.277
...believed in your minds,
understood in your hearts...

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.079
...to be innocent.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.358
So what is the truth?

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.109
Maybe the truth begins 18 years ago...

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.832
...when dozens of paintings...

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.912
...works of art by the defendant's father,
Sebastian Deardon...

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.754
...supposedly perished in a fire,
which also tragically took his life.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.750
Now, the insurance paid on those paintings
totaled $2.5 million.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.751
That's a staggering sum...

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.638
...but only a fraction
of what they'd be worth today.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.709
We believe...

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.311
...that those paintings still exist...

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.509
...and are today worth
more than $20 million.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.473
Victor Taft was not murdered
as an act of revenge by the defendant.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.713
Victor Taft was murdered
to protect someone...

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.230
...someone who himself, 18 years ago...

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.073
...was a co-conspirator
to arson, fraud, and murder.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.436
Someone who took advantage
of Chelsea Deardon...

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.313
...and tried to frame her for a crime
he himself was responsible for.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.549
Listen, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a complex case...

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.833
...but I'm confident that
once you've heard all the evidence...

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.158
...that you will come to a decision
that is the truth.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.190
And the truth is,
Chelsea Deardon is innocent.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.114
Thank you.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.554
Without objection, this court is adjourned
until 9:00 Monday morning.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.878
Eloquent, Tom.
Better have the goods by Monday.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.750
Yeah, just show up, Blanchard.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.358
Congratulations, counselor.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.716
If you meant to baffle them with bullshit,
my hat is off to you.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.473
If that's an indication
of where you're heading...

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.709
Count on it, Forrester.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.319
Daddy!

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.953
- Murderer.
- What?

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.954
- How dare you?
- I was there.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.237
A small child was there,
hardly qualified to come to a conclusion.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.799
You're a liar.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.832
I won't be made the scapegoat...

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.798
...for the desperate act
of an emotionally disturbed woman.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.873
Is that clear?

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.278
<i>Could you get Mr. Crane</i>
<i>in records, please?</i>

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.194
Mr. Crane...

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.034
...I have Mr. Morrison from claims.
One moment, please.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.709
Crane?

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.951
Crane, where are they?

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.438
I'm talking about the shipping files,
the Taft Gallery warehouse shipping files.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.589
Where are they?

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.831
I've got customers all over me.
Claim they never arrived.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.788
Immediately!

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.956
No, not tomorrow, now.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.512
Taft! Do I have to spell it?
Get them to me right away.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.795
Morrison. Claims. Now!

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.838
Otherwise you can talk
to the legal department.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.159
May I help you?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.793
Is this claims?

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.519
No. That's on 26.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.592
How do I look?

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.275
Joe Morrison. It's my first day on the job.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.875
Trying to make a good impression.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.191
- Where's my office?
- Morrison.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.910
Nobody told me. Are you sure?

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.036
- Laura, do you have that...
- Yes, of course, Mr. Morrison.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.557
"Effective immediately,
Joseph J. Morrison..." That's me.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.596
"Position of claims adjuster."

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:03.035
It's all here. This is claims, isn't it?

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.958
Yeah. Was somebody let go?

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.829
What a jungle.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.150
They fire someone
and don't even tell them?

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.437
- That's corporate America.
- This memo isn't signed. I'll have...

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:15.318
- Mr. Morrison's office?
- That's me, son.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.113
I need to do this from my office.
Which one is it?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.670
I'll have to speak to Mr. Phillips.
About this. Please wait here.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.270
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.157
Hong Kong. Two crates.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.833
Please excuse me. What?

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.309
You put the London form in the Asian pile.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.313
- That's not the Asian pile.
- What's that, South America?

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.595
No. Medium-sized crate pile.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.398
We're doing it geographically.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.153
We look for a pattern,
then what breaks the pattern.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.874
I know that, but I'm doing it by size. See?

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.158
"Taft Gallery to Victor Taft, 40 x 80 x 15."

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.914
- I see, but...
- Very large crate, large crate.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.956
Guess where it goes? Large crate pile.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.591
Here's another one.
"Taft Gallery to Victor Taft." Very large.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.718
Where did they ship?

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.672
Manhattan. Sutton Place.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.519
I thought Taft lived on Central Park West.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.229
<i>Dates?</i>

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.157
<i>Mid-September, all of them.</i>

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.595
<i>About the time we were at the gallery.</i>

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.752
So Taft sends himself a large shipment
to a strange address?

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.229
About the same time we went to see him.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.679
The Deardons!

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.639
It's me.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.114
I think they found what you're looking for.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.236
You'll get there first. I'll take care of it.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.913
Want to drive?

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.397
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.277
Logan, what are you doing?

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.753
Logan!

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.829
Logan!

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.392
What's your rush, man?

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.232
What's wrong with you?

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.429
I can do this. I can do this!

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.672
Holy shit!

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.955
God! Are you okay?

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.432
He ran right in front of me!

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.431
- You see it?
- I heard it.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.718
Okay.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.199
Logan!

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.436
- What are you doing?
- He took his wallet!

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.672
- Get in!
- Kelly! Brake!

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.073
Police!

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.199
Are you okay?

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.878
- Good driving.
- Thanks.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.799
Credit cards.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.356
$45 cash. Cleaners.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.515
Look at this.
Robert Forrester's business card.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.716
- Forrester?
- Forrester.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.196
What we got here is Fort Knox.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.112
Here's Taft. 2-B.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.918
Okay, you can come up,
but none of that funny stuff.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.197
Yeah? Then what's
the point of coming up?

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.789
What's this? It's open.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.475
Be careful.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.513
Chuck Close.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.757
The Transcontinental Express.
The same size as the shipment.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.308
Somebody's already
been through this stuff.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.873
Campbell's soup.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.990
Look at this Lichtenstein!

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.554
God, it must be worth $200,000.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.600
Why would somebody leave these
lying around here?

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.079
Mondrian...

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.959
...Steinberg...

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.033
There's millions of dollars worth
of paintings here...

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.594
...but no Deardons.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.989
Look at this.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.993
A wall-to-wall bed.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.635
You could have a tag-team match on it.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.710
Tom...

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.631
If Taft has... Jeez!

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.354
Forrester.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.757
I'm going to call the police.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.958
No, on second thought,
maybe we shouldn't call the police.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.473
Maybe we should...

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.755
What?

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.555
What?

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.958
You scared me to death.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.159
What are you doing here?

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.515
You left me a message to meet you here.

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.069
- There was no message.
- You left a message.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.116
How did you get in here?

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.316
This was Victor's and my place.
I have a key.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.596
Oh no, not again.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.599
Okay, let's hear it.
That famous Logan instinct.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:12.989
You first.

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.512
I don't see how she could've lifted
a 200-pound man on the bed.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.318
Therefore, she's innocent.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.078
What in the hell is that?
Where have I seen that before?

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.354
That's the Bertolini.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.510
Remember we saw the model
in Taft's office?

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.795
The one he couldn't sell
for sentimental reasons.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.711
Victor hated that sculpture.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.556
He thought Bertolini was a joke.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.270
We have got to get to the Taft Gallery.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.673
I'll find Cavanaugh...

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.752
...get a search warrant
and meet you at the gallery soon.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.798
<i>The private Victor Taft</i>
<i>was an incredibly warm human being...</i>

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.555
<i>A leader...</i>

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:28.839
<i>... a benefactor.</i>

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.428
<i>Victor Taft championed my work...</i>

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.748
<i>... at a time when</i>
<i>no one else was interested.</i>

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.115
<i>But Victor had vision.</i>

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.395
<i>The contribution that Victor made</i>
<i>to young artists...</i>

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.913
<i>... and through them...</i>

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.759
What do you think?

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.392
- It sounds hollow.
- Yeah.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.360
Detective Cavanaugh, you guys. Where...

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.633
Detective Cavanaugh?

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.395
- I'm looking for Detective Cavanaugh.
- That's me. What can I do for you?

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.112
- You're Cavanaugh?
- Yeah.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.359
You're the only Detective Cavanaugh
in Manhattan South?

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.396
There must be a way into this.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.468
Cavanaugh.

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.313
The name's Joe Brock.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.432
And whatever's inside
that piece of crap belongs to me.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.195
Oh, God!

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.349
Shit!

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.715
Hey! What are you doing there?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.831
Breaking into my car.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.279
Is that the gun you used
to kill Taft and Forrester?

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.312
It just might be the gun I use to kill you.
Take that.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.952
Okay, Kelly, take a whack at it.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.553
Pretend it's my head.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.912
Who was the guy that shot at us?
The one that followed Chelsea?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.150
Nobody. A hired hand, paid to do a job.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.434
It's in there!

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.318
Come on, hit it again!

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.150
When did you decide to kill Taft,
Cavanaugh?

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.800
After Taft and Forrester set me up
for prison.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.474
Just waited for my chance. Come on.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.868
Come on!

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.509
Come on.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.758
It's mine!

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.356
Fire!

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.308
Oh, God.

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.033
Please hurry.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.119
Come on, Chelsea!

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.759
Go on!

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.671
- Can we go down the stairs?
- No, you can't get out there.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.996
- Over here!
- Chelsea come on!

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.149
Down here.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.389
Let's go!

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.954
What about me?

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.869
Over here.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.159
Oh, my God!

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.193
Oh, God.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.639
And so in conclusion,
Your Honor, in light of the new...

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.959
...and seemingly incontrovertible
evidence presented before this court...

01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.909
...on the admirable initiative
of the estimable co-counsels for defense...

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.319
...we, the people, recommend
that all charges against...

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.118
...Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon...

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.428
...be dismissed.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.869
So be it.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.118
This case is dismissed.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.993
Court is adjourned.

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.113
Congratulations, Tom.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.269
Wonderful job.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.679
Comeback of the year!

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.079
I had a little help.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.077
Yeah, sure. Good work, Miss...

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.191
- Kelly.
...Kelly.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.590
- Tom, you got a great opportunity here.
- What?

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.148
All these reporters here
to launch your campaign...

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.708
- Campaign!
- For district attorney, remember?

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.395
I remember being fired as an assistant DA.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.198
You were never fired officially.

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.191
Never put the paperwork through.

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.669
In his own way,
he was backing you 100 percent.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.759
You must think like a politician.
Tom, you're the hottest legal property.

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.718
We could win this election
by just announcing your candidacy.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.119
What do you say?

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.035
Forget it.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.428
- Forget it?
- Forget it.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.751
Too proud to come back?

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.793
Too happy where I am.

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.397
Should have put the paperwork through.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.711
Ms. Deardon, what will happen
to your father's paintings?

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.434
I'm not sure.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.672
I'm just happy they still exist.

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:24.194
Were you ever actually in love with Taft?

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.915
Once.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.269
Maybe.

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.709
I can't remember.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.870
Yet you lived with him for some time.

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.598
Some time for one purpose.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.273
How do you feel now?

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.713
Vintage Chelsea.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.479
First she seduces Taft
'cause she needed information.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.755
Then she seduces you
because she needed help.

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.674
With the risk of seeming immodest
I think what she did with me...

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.115
...was because she found me
simply attractive.

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.832
It's perfectly understandable.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.069
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.799
Because Chelsea's good at
luring men onto her bed.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.233
Extremely good.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.114
No, no. I pick the adjectives.

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.554
"Big eyes."

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.154
"Hypnotic eyes."

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.669
"Unforgettable eyes." She has great eyes!

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.079
Yes, she does...

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.716
...but they're not as great as yours.
