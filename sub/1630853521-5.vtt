[Lola] <i> Previously on</i>
All Rise...

00:02.203 --> 00:03.202
We can't all be perfect.

00:03.204 --> 00:04.703
Lola, with the dream job

00:04.705 --> 00:06.705
-and the beautiful baby girl.
-You see, I'm a psychic.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.640
I'm looking for the job
as a court reporter

00:08.709 --> 00:10.542
to supplement my income.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.811
Don't talk about my mother.
You understand?

00:12.813 --> 00:15.014
My brother is not a murderer.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.415
Darius,
I'm the victim's advocate

00:16.417 --> 00:17.316
assigned to this case.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.817
<i> A "chimera" refers to</i>

00:18.819 --> 00:21.653
someone who could be
carrying two totally
different sets of DNAs.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.422
-[all exclaiming]
-The records include...

00:23.424 --> 00:25.524
-Received the
bone marrows transplant...
-[gavels bangs]

00:25.526 --> 00:28.160
Council, you both
are out of order.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.728
I wanna see you
in my chambers now.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.165
You never
should have introduced

00:33.233 --> 00:34.432
this new medical information

00:34.434 --> 00:36.635
-without first...
-You have Carl's
medical records,

00:36.704 --> 00:39.204
-same as me...
-It said nothing
of multiple DNA markers.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.740
[stammers] And what is this
chimera crap? Sounds like...

00:41.809 --> 00:43.409
-fiction.
-Chimera and your own expert

00:43.411 --> 00:44.643
just testifies that it's not.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.912
I'm not obligated to turn in
any more documentation.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.014
-It's impeachment evidence
for the people's expert.
-[Lola] Hey!

00:49.016 --> 00:50.382
You done?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.251
Your Honor, I'm requesting
that Mr. Brewer's DNA
be retested

00:52.319 --> 00:53.652
and that the people be
granted time

00:53.754 --> 00:55.554
to analyze and review
this claim.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.723
Your Honor, this continuance
would be a denial
of due process,

00:57.725 --> 00:59.324
to deny a fair trial.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.193
Granting it will be
an interference by the court
to help the prosecution.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.062
Mr. Watkins, I understand
your position.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.631
But given that this is a very
unusual circumstance,

01:05.633 --> 01:07.232
-I'm going to
grant the request.
-Boom.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.901
Mr. Callan, you have 48 hours.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.603
Your Honor, it takes
time to run tests
for multiple points.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.405
Blood, hair follicles,
the works.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.741
We need to ensure that
all known sample
of the defendant

01:15.810 --> 01:17.509
are corroborated
not only with each other,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.711
but also with the evidence
collected at the crime scene.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.814
Then I suggest you hurry,
'cause I made my ruling.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.320
[Darius] <i> So, what does</i>
<i> all this mean?</i>

01:28.322 --> 01:30.823
Is he getting off because he
has two different sets of DNA?

01:30.825 --> 01:31.757
I really don't know.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.025
I haven't heard
of this before.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.626
I'm not sure anyone has.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.828
What happens now?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.696
Well, look,
Mark Callan is a fighter

01:37.698 --> 01:39.264
and he will do everything
in his power

01:39.333 --> 01:40.299
to get justice for your mom.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.934
-That I know.
-Okay.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.303
Why don't you go down
for some air and I'll get
some coffee.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.642
-Hi!
-Hey.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.810
Oh, come here.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.946
-How are you holding up?
-Thanks, friend.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.949
This has been a very long,
very strange day.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.618
But, I got you
a little house-warming gift.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.087
Oh! And you know
I'm a lavender girl.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.822
I do. So...

02:03.824 --> 02:05.657
-How's the new apartment?
-I just checked it out.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.826
This building is amazing.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.229
It's got a private gym,
it has a pool, a sauna,

02:10.231 --> 02:11.730
-an in-house movie theatre.
-Oh!

02:11.732 --> 02:13.365
Well, I'm officially jealous.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.434
I'm grabbing
the rest of my stuff
from my brother's tonight

02:15.503 --> 02:17.703
and I will finally have
a peaceful place of my own.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.505
-Thanks.
-Well, that sounds amazing.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.507
Um, dinner this week?

02:21.509 --> 02:22.808
-I'll bring a wine.
-Okay.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.710
And thank you again
for my candle, I love it.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.644
-Of course.
-[Edith] Emily!

02:25.746 --> 02:27.446
-Edith! Yeah!
-Do you have a minute?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.348
One of our attorneys
is in the middle of a case,

02:29.449 --> 02:31.316
but her mother was just
rushed for the hospital.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.718
I know this is really unusual,

02:32.720 --> 02:34.119
but could you
take over her case?

02:34.121 --> 02:36.321
-It looks like she's gonna be
out for a while.
-Sure.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.823
You're a lifesaver.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.191
It's Gloria Hernandez.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.559
Residential burglary,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.060
grand theft, gun possession.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.028
She's a real peach.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.129
You can handle a juvie case.
Can't you?

02:44.131 --> 02:45.664
-Of course.
-Great.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.199
Uh, the adjudication
starts tomorrow.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.100
I owe you.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.403
Juvie court. Hmm.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.340
They're rerunning
the blood panel

02:55.409 --> 02:56.508
and tracked down your donor.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.709
Now, you and your sister

02:57.711 --> 02:59.144
-never met him, right?
-No.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.048
He said that he wanted
to be anonymous.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.050
And all this time,
I've been thinking,

03:05.052 --> 03:07.319
God sent me an angel.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.055
Now, it turns out,
my angel could be a killer.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.690
-[scoffs]
-Carl, that entire case

03:11.692 --> 03:14.126
is based on
circumstantial evidence

03:14.128 --> 03:16.628
and we have
a reasonable explanation

03:16.630 --> 03:17.963
-for all of it.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.833
You know, I used
to listen to those...

03:21.935 --> 03:24.536
murder mystery podcasts.
You know the ones?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.605
I thought it was entertaining.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.808
Now, I feel like,
I'm living in one.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.958
Hi, I'm Emily Lopez
to see Gloria Hernandez.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.326
-Oh, perfect.
Thank you so much.
-Right there.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.930
Gloria, Hi.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.699
Um, my name is Emily Lopez.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.934
Your attorney has
a family emergency.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.536
So, I will be
representing you now.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.905
Can we, um,
can we talk for a few minutes?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.440
[sighs]

04:07.815 --> 04:09.948
[Emily] Well, you know,
this whole experience

04:09.950 --> 04:12.417
must be scary, but I just
wanna ask you
a few questions.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.752
Okay?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.520
Residential burglary,
grand theft

04:15.522 --> 04:17.022
and gun possession are

04:17.024 --> 04:19.224
-really serious charges.
Did you know that?
-[chuckles]

04:20.361 --> 04:21.727
[audience cheering]

04:26.834 --> 04:29.001
You were seen on surveillance

04:29.003 --> 04:31.937
entering the home in Pasadena
through and unlocked dog door

04:32.006 --> 04:33.939
-in broad day light.
-People should learn
to lock their shit up.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.311
You were accused of trying
to steal a $100,000 vase?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.613
I didn't expect
a wireless sensor. That was...

04:41.615 --> 04:43.148
-that was my bad.
-Why would you wanna
steal a vase?

04:43.217 --> 04:44.950
It was the Xiang dynasty. Duh.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.319
-And you had a gun?
-Okay, that was also
my bad, I...

04:47.321 --> 04:48.954
-I just didn't mean to
bring it with me.
-But it's yours?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.323
Yeah, but I keep it unloaded.
It's just to...

04:52.059 --> 04:53.325
scare off the pervs.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.330
You do understand that these
are very serious charges?

04:58.332 --> 04:59.665
You've said that already.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.934
Wow. [scoffs]

05:02.936 --> 05:05.737
Okay, well, if you would like
to throw your life away,

05:05.806 --> 05:07.105
-I guess that's your choice.
-[chuckles softly]

05:07.107 --> 05:09.207
I'll get, like, nine months
in probation camp.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.342
That's not my life.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.643
You don't have to be
so dramatic about it.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.345
There were people home.
And you had a gun.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.747
You could get a lot longer.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.224
-Edith!
-Oh, good.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.492
I was hoping to catch you.
What happened?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.027
I am no
child psychologist, okay.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.662
And I get that she's
been through a lot.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.265
But I really don't think
that she cares at all
about her circumstances.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.399
You know, kids.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.534
Then how could you
call her a peach?

05:35.635 --> 05:36.401
I don't like peaches.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.737
You have to see this.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.306
What is...

05:44.912 --> 05:46.511
[siren blaring]

05:46.513 --> 05:47.512
She filmed the burglary.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.617
-[knocks]
-Hey.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.387
Whoo! Real quiet in here.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.055
-Man, am I glad to see you.
-Y'all bet.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.758
You know, this whole building
is talking about hybrid human.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.426
Don't remind me, all right.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.428
I'm trying to track down
the bone marrow doners
through the cancer center.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.930
Good. What else
have you got on there?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.032
Aside from his DNA
on the victim,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.900
Carl was seen at
the restaurant
where she works.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.535
He lived in that neighborhood,
did he?

06:10.637 --> 06:12.037
He also had
the same caliber gun.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.306
Nine millimeter.
Although it was reported

06:14.308 --> 06:17.309
-stolen a few years prior.
-Yeah, if he's clever,
he could still have it.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.211
What about his neighbors?
His coworkers?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.712
-What are they
saying about him?
-Not much.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.913
He was quiet, kept to himself.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.615
Any reluctant witnesses
we can persuade?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.650
I'm still waiting to
hear back from a few, but...

06:25.719 --> 06:27.619
He basically just hung out
with his sister

06:27.621 --> 06:28.920
and she's definitely
not talking to me.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.523
Yeah, well, something's
gotta stand out, you know?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.959
Either about him,
about his past

06:33.961 --> 06:35.227
or about the day
of the murder.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.328
Tony, I gotta be
honest with you,

06:36.330 --> 06:37.963
I am running out
of rocks to turn over.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.932
Then we'll find some
boulders to move.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.801
Because, if you set
a murderer free,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.536
you'll never forgive yourself.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.104
Trust me.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.206
It will haunt your
for the rest of your life.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.953
-[knocks]
-Knock, knock!

07:02.022 --> 07:03.422
I figured you hadn't
eaten yet.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.223
I love you so much right now.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.158
Thank you.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.960
Sorry, I missed dinner.
How's Rachel?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.862
She's Rachel, so she's great.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.598
-She says, "Hi."
-With her usual storm
of chaotic energy.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.934
-Never leaves home without it.
-[cell chimes]

07:16.804 --> 07:19.604
Oh, Collier just texted
that my insurance

07:19.606 --> 07:22.040
is finally covering
his medication.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.409
-I can't believe
that took so long.
-That is terrific.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.411
I'm so glad
he's taken care of.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.947
So, what's the latest
with the case?

07:29.016 --> 07:32.117
Well, this Carl Brewer
possibly having
two sets of DNA,

07:32.119 --> 07:33.919
-we're scrambling.
-Hey, can't you get
a blood sample from

07:33.921 --> 07:35.720
-before her had the surgery?
-No, we tried.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.556
The original lab shut down
almost ten years ago.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.090
-All the samples were lost.
-So, what now?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.525
The lead detective's trying
to track down

07:40.527 --> 07:41.426
the bone marrow donor,

07:41.428 --> 07:42.861
but since the lab closed

07:42.929 --> 07:44.129
all the records
were transferred.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.064
-They can be anywhere.
-Why don't you use the press?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.899
-For what?
-To help track this donor.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.534
You might never get
the hospital records,

07:49.636 --> 07:51.436
so you might as well
utilize the public.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.938
It's just...
it's not me and I mean,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.307
I don't want this to be
more of a circus
than it already is.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.341
Detectives are on it.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.777
And once we find the donor
and where he was

07:58.779 --> 08:00.946
when Brenda Fletcher
disappeared,

08:00.948 --> 08:03.148
-they'll know who killed her.
-Carl or the donor?

08:03.250 --> 08:05.717
Unless, Carl isn't the only
person he donated to.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.324
[sighs]

08:22.936 --> 08:24.936
Now, I don't want you
to be nervous.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.638
Okay? The trial is gonna
break down like--

08:26.740 --> 08:27.839
It's not called a trial here,

08:27.941 --> 08:29.441
-it's an adjudication.
-Right.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.809
That's what I meant.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.811
There are going to be
a few witnesses,

08:32.813 --> 08:35.413
the prosecution will introduce
all of their evidence.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.216
Tomorrow, we'll appeal to
the judge for leniency
during sentencing.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.818
-Disposition.
-Yes.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.420
-During the disposition.
-Yeah, I know.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.822
-You've done
this before, right?
-Yes.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.323
-Of course.
-Hello, Ms. Lopez.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.993
-Hello.
-[man] All rise.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.761
Court is now in session.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.963
The honorable judge
Alister Khoo presiding.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.499
Good morning. Be seated.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.335
Gloria Hernandez is present
with council,

08:57.437 --> 08:59.304
the people are represented.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.505
Well, Ms. Gloria,

09:00.507 --> 09:02.007
this is quite a step up

09:02.009 --> 09:03.542
from your previous
theft charge

09:03.610 --> 09:05.944
and the trespassing charge
before that.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.514
This is disappointing.
Very disappointing.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.250
Okay, let's begin.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.225
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.493
[Lola] Sherri,
before this trial

09:21.495 --> 09:23.228
had you ever heard
of someone having

09:23.230 --> 09:24.629
-two DNAs?
-No.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.965
Two personalities,
but not two DNAs. No.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.700
Thank you.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.702
Oh... you have the look.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.037
I'm worried with
all this press.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.038
It's gonna affect the jury.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.205
Do you want
to sequester them--

09:34.207 --> 09:35.807
These headlines are
keeping me awake at night.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.676
I can only imagine this
affecting them to--

09:37.678 --> 09:39.544
Oh, they are most affected.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.479
Their energy
is at times chaotic

09:41.481 --> 09:42.714
and overwhelming.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.617
You know what's keeping
me up at night?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.754
What? Really?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.156
You love this stuff.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.058
No, I do. It's just...

09:53.060 --> 09:54.726
She is too good.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.161
You know the pregnant
court reporter on three.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.263
-Hmm.
-Well, Ilani correctly
predicted the sex of that baby

09:58.331 --> 10:00.098
and she knew that Ronnie
was gonna propose to his
girlfriend today.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.733
-So, what happened?
-Well, he hasn't proposed yet.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.334
-No. With you?
-Oh...

10:03.336 --> 10:05.837
well, let's just say she
gave me a reading
that hit too close to home.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.841
-See?
-Here is probation reports

10:09.943 --> 10:12.043
and don't forget,
you have a lunch with Rachel
at 1:00 today.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.179
Ooh! She's been speaking
in her high voice.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.213
Which usually means...

10:15.215 --> 10:17.048
-She's got juicy gossip.
-You know it.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.216
-Hey...
-[chuckles] Yes.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.818
-I miss this.
-What?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.419
Us.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.522
Me too, Your Honor.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.092
Me too.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.734
-Can you identify
who's walking on the property?
-The defendant.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.802
You can see her walking
directly to the kitchen door,

10:37.804 --> 10:39.237
when we lose sight of her.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.538
That's when she went through
the dog door to enter
the hall--

10:40.640 --> 10:42.340
-Objection, foundation.
-[Khoo] Sustained.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.042
-Lay a foundation.
-You don't have to
keep standing.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.844
-What?
-How do you know it was
the defendant seen

10:45.945 --> 10:47.545
-on this video?
-We zoomed in
to make an identification.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.383
-Overruled.
-Showing you people's five.

10:51.385 --> 10:52.416
What is this photograph?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.052
These images are thin,
rubber wheel marks

10:54.121 --> 10:56.054
found on both the kitchen
and the hall floor

10:56.123 --> 10:58.123
which match the skateboard
the defendant was caught with.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.624
It's how she didn't send off
the motion sensors

10:59.626 --> 11:01.326
-which were set at 4:15.
-Objection.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.627
Foundation. Motion to strike.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.962
He's not an expert
on wheel marks.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.330
Sustained and stricken.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.298
Ms. Lopez, you can
keep your seat.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.533
We're not formal here.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.136
And if there are no more
questions for this witness,

11:11.204 --> 11:13.104
let's pick up here
after lunch.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.538
[gavel bangs]

11:19.012 --> 11:21.513
Callan, I need your help.
How many juvie cases
have you tried?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.148
A few. Early days. Why?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.016
Will you teach me everything
you know and fast?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.118
They called you out on
terminology, didn't they?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.154
Adjudication,
after-care, intake,

11:29.222 --> 11:31.456
and we don't stand
when we address the judge?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.024
[cell chimes]

11:33.026 --> 11:35.126
-What happened here?
-This is me going over
cold cases, trying to...

11:35.128 --> 11:36.293
think outside the box

11:36.295 --> 11:38.963
which as it turns out
is not as easy as it sounds.

11:39.065 --> 11:39.964
[Emily] Hmm.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.100
What the hell's going on?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.401
[scoffs]

11:43.403 --> 11:45.003
It's all over the media.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.306
Five people claiming they know
who the anonymous
bone marrow donor is.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.976
[sighs]

11:51.978 --> 11:53.511
Your Honor, the people
are requesting
a short continuance

11:53.513 --> 11:54.746
-with the investi--
-What? No!

11:54.848 --> 11:56.414
We will not accept
another delay.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.616
It's the blatant violation
of due process

11:58.618 --> 12:00.051
and my client's
speedy trail rights.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.220
We need to investigate
two new viable leads

12:02.222 --> 12:03.221
regarding
the bone marrow donor.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.724
Mr. Kalen has not given
good cause

12:05.726 --> 12:07.158
for another continuance.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.627
We will not sit around
while he investigates claims

12:09.730 --> 12:11.329
from every
attention-hungry loon

12:11.331 --> 12:12.530
claiming to know something

12:12.532 --> 12:14.532
-about the anonymous donor.
-Okay!

12:14.601 --> 12:16.701
-Enough, you two.
-[coughs]

12:16.703 --> 12:19.938
Though I do believe
the people have established
good cause for a continuance,

12:20.039 --> 12:21.506
Mr. Watkins is correct.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.907
We need to move this along.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.310
So, Mr. Kalen, you have
24 hours,

12:25.312 --> 12:26.511
-but that is all.
-Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.612
[gavel bangs]

12:36.757 --> 12:38.957
[helicopter hovering]

12:40.260 --> 12:43.261
You are clearly smart

12:43.330 --> 12:45.864
with a surprisingly strong
grasp on juvie law.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.300
Gloria, you're just a kid.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.703
You shouldn't be so carefree
about losing your freedom

12:51.705 --> 12:54.005
for any amount of time.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.508
It would be nice to have

12:56.510 --> 12:59.310
something productive
to say at your sentencing.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.514
I mean, your disposition.
[chuckles softly]

13:02.516 --> 13:06.017
Can you at least tell me
if someone put you up to it?

13:06.019 --> 13:08.019
I mean, how would you
even know the vase was there?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.521
And where would you
even sell it?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.723
Okay, at least tell me

13:11.725 --> 13:13.424
why you did it
in the middle of the day.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.726
Everyone's at work and school.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.028
Right. That's...

13:19.800 --> 13:21.365
Listen...

13:21.367 --> 13:24.035
I'm really sorry that your
parents passed away
in that car accident.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.503
I really am.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.106
You and your sister were
lucky to have survived it.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.842
And I cannot imagine

13:30.944 --> 13:34.212
how difficult it's been
for you to be in foster care.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.147
But, at least,
you guys are there together.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.950
Gloria, your future matters.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.018
No, it doesn't.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.120
Hers does.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.855
My sister is all that matters.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.257
I'm good.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.529
[Gloria sighs]

13:54.601 --> 13:56.301
The new DNA test came back

13:56.303 --> 13:58.036
and you do have
two distinct markers.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.704
-So, now we got
reasonable doubt.
-That's right.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.339
But, Mark Callan

14:01.408 --> 14:03.041
is one of the best DAs
in LA County.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.677
So, we need to be prepared
for anything and everything.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.946
Now, I know I keep
asking you this,

14:07.948 --> 14:09.948
but is there anyone who can
establish an alibi

14:10.016 --> 14:11.549
for you the day...

14:11.651 --> 14:13.418
Brenda Fletcher reportedly
went missing?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.853
You're telling me
the DNA aren't enough now?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.322
I'm trying to build
the strongest defense I can.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.824
[thumps]

14:20.627 --> 14:22.927
[sigh] Kid,
you tell me something,

14:22.929 --> 14:24.062
if they find the donor

14:24.163 --> 14:25.196
and he's some richie-rich

14:25.198 --> 14:26.731
that can get a hot-shot lawyer
to get him off,

14:26.733 --> 14:28.099
what happens to me? Huh?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.801
Ain't I got no alibi, so...

14:29.803 --> 14:31.502
I get stuck
holding the bag, right?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.304
Don't the poor always
take the fall?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.039
I can get screwed
no matter what.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.274
Shoot.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.545
I may be better off
if they never find him.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.317
[woman] Powerful forces
are around you.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.953
They're guiding you
into another path.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.055
Now, you must stop resisting

14:51.057 --> 14:52.824
for this is your destiny.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.225
What is... what is my destiny?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.128
-All will be revealed in time.
-But how much time?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.529
When you're ready,
you'll know.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.832
[scoffs]

15:03.136 --> 15:04.936
How did you know I needed
a giant cookie today?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.004
[chuckles]

15:06.006 --> 15:07.639
Every day is better
with a giant cookie.

15:07.641 --> 15:08.506
Come on, now.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.708
So, did she tell you
your future?

15:10.710 --> 15:12.310
I guess, I... [sighs]

15:12.312 --> 15:13.877
I don't know.

15:13.879 --> 15:16.514
After yesterday, I thought it
might be a good idea
to get a reading.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.750
-Why? What happened?
-While I was moving my stuff

15:18.818 --> 15:20.118
out of Rachel's office,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.819
because she's back in town
this week,

15:21.821 --> 15:23.955
I got a call that I lost
my new apartment.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.456
Wow. That's a lot.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.457
I'm sorry.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.326
If you still need a place
to crash,

15:28.328 --> 15:29.527
the offer's still open.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.464
Um, thank you,
I will let you know.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.501
How's your juvie case?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.605
Not only...

15:40.607 --> 15:42.340
my 16-year-old client

15:42.409 --> 15:44.409
live streamed herself

15:44.411 --> 15:46.711
stealing a $100,000 vase

15:46.713 --> 15:47.745
in the middle of the day,

15:47.847 --> 15:50.815
and yes, the metadata
confirmed that it did come

15:50.817 --> 15:52.016
from her phone,

15:52.018 --> 15:53.651
but she was also
caught on surveillance

15:53.753 --> 15:55.053
breaking in.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.622
So, literally, the only
defense I have right now

15:57.624 --> 16:00.224
is that she's the kid
that did this stupid thing.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.026
So, they've got her
dead to rights.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.661
All you can do
is convince the judge

16:03.763 --> 16:05.163
that she has a future
worth saving.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.965
She doesn't even think
she has a future worth saving.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.233
-Mmm.
-How is it going
with you and Mark?

16:09.335 --> 16:12.236
Judge Carmichael keeps
granting his every wish

16:12.305 --> 16:13.805
like a fairy godmother.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.707
I'm trying to
connect with Carl, but...

16:15.709 --> 16:17.408
even with the good news,
he has no hope,

16:17.410 --> 16:19.110
They guy has been
sitting in jail

16:19.112 --> 16:20.345
while fighting for his life,
you know.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.613
He's probably trying to
manage his expectations.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.350
Seen a lot of people
failing him his entire life.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.752
So, I don't know if he
believes in anyone anymore.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.254
Then, make him believe in you

16:30.323 --> 16:31.856
by giving him back
his freedom.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.160
[Rachel] She's getting so big!

16:36.229 --> 16:38.529
She's growing so fast

16:38.531 --> 16:40.031
and I feel like
I'm missing it all.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.933
When she's older, she'll
understand that her mommy

16:41.935 --> 16:44.235
was a very important person.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.937
Besides...

16:45.939 --> 16:47.905
her daddy is perfectly
capable of changing a diaper.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.041
He even potty trained her.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.310
-No.
-Robin has been great!

16:52.312 --> 16:54.512
I'm the one who's trying
not to be jealous that

16:54.514 --> 16:56.147
he gets to be
with her all the time

16:56.216 --> 16:57.949
and that he never
misses a first.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.417
Weren't you guys
getting a nanny?

16:59.419 --> 17:02.520
Or is Robin planning on not
going back to work
and this is it?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.322
'It"? What do you
mean by "it"?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.524
Raising our daughter
is no small feat.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.726
-It is a huge responsibility.
-Girl, girl, girl, girl!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.162
Don't get defensive.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.298
I was suggesting that you two

17:14.300 --> 17:18.536
find yourselves
some "Oh, baby!" time.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.105
-Oh, baby!
-[chuckles]

17:21.107 --> 17:24.042
-[Lola] Where is that?
-Surfing Caicos.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.277
-Oh!
-I took a just because

17:26.279 --> 17:29.547
-weekend getaway.
-Wow, this looks fabulous.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.015
If you haven't hired help,

17:31.017 --> 17:33.751
ask Roxie to watch her
and just go!

17:34.220 --> 17:35.420
Girl!

17:35.422 --> 17:37.055
-You earned it!
-Uh...

17:37.156 --> 17:38.523
-You and Mister Mom.
-[chuckles]

17:38.525 --> 17:39.657
-[waitress] Two iced-teas.
-Thank you.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.025
Maybe one day.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.428
Hey, there is something
I wanna talk to you about.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.263
Don't sound so serious.
You make me nervous.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.764
It's just, um...

17:46.800 --> 17:48.599
I told you that Andre and I

17:48.601 --> 17:50.935
were hanging out
a little bit in DC.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.105
-Yeah, how is he?
-He's great.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.707
[stammers] That's actually
what I wanted to
talk to you about.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.509
It's been a few months now

17:58.511 --> 18:01.112
and things are
going really well.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.814
-But...
-No but. I just...

18:04.717 --> 18:06.217
it feels like,

18:06.219 --> 18:08.619
we're going to the next level.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.755
And I want to make sure

18:11.391 --> 18:12.723
you're cool with it.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.827
What? Are you serious?

18:15.829 --> 18:17.662
Dre is great and...

18:17.763 --> 18:19.530
we were a thing like
a million years ago.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.998
You two were
more than a thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.200
I know.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.602
But he's
a wonderful man and...

18:24.604 --> 18:26.704
I am happy for you honestly.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.039
Lola.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.344
Dre...

18:33.413 --> 18:36.147
She didn't tell me
that you were here.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.515
[Andre chuckles]

18:37.517 --> 18:39.217
Oh, look at that!
What a surprise!

18:39.219 --> 18:42.019
-You look sensational.
-Oh, thank you.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.754
-Come on. Sit, sit, sit.
-All right.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.625
-[chuckles]
-[Lola] Look at you two.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.026
[chuckles]

18:49.028 --> 18:51.062
Please tell us
that you have good news.

18:51.064 --> 18:51.929
Wasn't easy.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.064
But we've finally
tracked down

18:53.133 --> 18:54.932
where the medical records
had been transferred.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.934
A Mr. Leonard Green was
called Brewer's anonymous

18:57.003 --> 18:59.403
bone marrow donor
back in 1987.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.539
The lab ran both his
and Brewer's DNA

19:01.641 --> 19:03.941
through CODIS and they do
have a shared DNA marker.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.209
And according to
the data bank,

19:05.211 --> 19:07.445
Mr. Green only made
the one bone marrow donation.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.180
-Any other links?
-He lived in
Brewer's neighborhood

19:09.182 --> 19:10.715
where they have
the bone marrow drive

19:10.717 --> 19:12.683
and he even frequented
the bar where your
victim used to work.

19:12.685 --> 19:16.053
-Well, did you pick him up?
-Unfortunately, Mr. Green
is no longer with us.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.855
He died two months ago
in a house fire

19:17.957 --> 19:19.323
due to faulty wiring.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.525
We did some asking around,

19:20.527 --> 19:21.926
but it seems the guy
was a homebody,

19:21.928 --> 19:23.261
pretty much kept to himself.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.428
If he was the killer,

19:24.430 --> 19:25.730
any evidence
we would've collected

19:25.732 --> 19:26.831
went up in flames with him.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.799
-Thanks.
-Sorry, wasn't better news.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.101
-Geez.
-You know that I have

19:30.103 --> 19:31.536
Carl's interrogation
statements?

19:31.604 --> 19:34.839
The gun and questionable DNA?

19:34.908 --> 19:36.340
I just don't see
a strong chance

19:36.409 --> 19:38.509
for a conviction here,
not without a "Hail Mary."

19:38.511 --> 19:40.511
But, we can go through
this all again, all right?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.579
Maybe something else
will pop up.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.914
Tony, I can't shake
the feeling

19:42.982 --> 19:44.715
that there is something
more that we're
missing with Carl.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.118
Yeah, but you know,
we cannot convict on theory.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.119
I know, I know.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.421
Look, I...

19:50.423 --> 19:53.057
I saw a glance that he gave
his sister in court once

19:53.159 --> 19:55.226
and it was, I mean,
it was a moment.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.728
But it made the hair
on my back stand up.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.364
There was something in
the interrogation video
I wanted to show you.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.099
It's not evidence.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.401
But I think it might
help us understand

20:03.403 --> 20:04.635
who Carl Brewer really is.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.205
<i> ...On her dead body, Carl.</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:08.606
People with
psycho-pathologies,

20:08.608 --> 20:11.108
they share a certain tell.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.911
They don't yawn
when other people yawn.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.515
They lack a basic ability
to make empathetic connection.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.317
Okay, I know it's a reach...

20:20.453 --> 20:23.120
but I'm telling you,
there is something wrong

20:23.122 --> 20:25.623
-with this guy.
-Yeah, well,
I'm with you there.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.959
Guy certainly gives me a vibe.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.261
But, we're gonna need
more than yawns and glances

20:30.330 --> 20:31.729
that put him away.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.630
<i> You're right.</i>

20:36.402 --> 20:38.236
And it was my
first time clerking,

20:38.304 --> 20:40.104
-I wanted to, you know,
make a good impression.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.607
But, I was so nervous
about just everything.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.609
The man never smiled. Never.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.844
But Lola hadn't been there
a full week as an intern

20:46.946 --> 20:48.946
before she had him in
doubled over in laughter.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.214
He was a teddy bear.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.950
-[chuckles]
-No, no, you are a lion tamer.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.952
Well, you have a...

20:54.954 --> 20:56.354
talent for calming beasts.

20:56.956 --> 20:57.822
Thank you.

20:57.824 --> 20:58.823
-Hmm...
-[cell phone ringing]

20:58.825 --> 21:00.625
-[Lola chuckles]
-Oh...

21:00.627 --> 21:02.159
-Please, excuse me.
-Yeah.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.232
I'm so glad this isn't weird.

21:08.334 --> 21:11.235
No! I am happy for you.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.803
-[Rachel] Thank you.
-Perfect.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.747
Mark!

21:22.848 --> 21:25.216
Found someone in the lobby
who's looking for you.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.717
-Mr. Callan?
-Mmm-hmm.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.053
-You've been trying to reach
me about a Carl Brewer.
-Yeah.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.723
My name is Charlene Addison.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.725
16 years ago,
Carl Brewer tried to kill me.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.702
[Addison] I realized,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.704
if I don't speak up

21:46.706 --> 21:47.705
and he gets off,

21:48.708 --> 21:49.807
I'd feel worse.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.108
Charlene, in your
previous statement

21:51.110 --> 21:52.810
you said, you first met
Mr. Brewer

21:52.812 --> 21:54.612
in 2006. Is that right?

21:54.614 --> 21:57.782
I waitressed in a little
dive bar on Figueroa.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.216
And he came in one night.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.085
We talked a bit.

22:01.087 --> 22:04.355
After my shift,
we had a few drinks.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.123
And then he asked me
if I wanted to get some food.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.226
Walked into his car.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.729
That's when I started to get
a weird feeling about him.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.099
He touched my hair.
Asked me if it was mine.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.702
But it was the way he said it.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.706
Then later, we were leaning
against his car, kissing.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.943
[breath trembling]

22:25.945 --> 22:27.812
I glanced inside and I saw...

22:30.149 --> 22:32.950
a rope on the backseat
and gloves on the floor.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.653
I tried to leave,
but he wouldn't let me.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.621
He grabbed me by my throat

22:37.623 --> 22:40.224
and... and then
I just felt myself

22:40.226 --> 22:42.793
blacking out and then
all of a sudden

22:42.795 --> 22:45.429
a car backfired
and it startled him.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.431
And he loosened his grip

22:47.433 --> 22:50.601
and that's when I shoved him
and I ran for my life.

22:50.603 --> 22:54.338
[sobbing]

22:54.440 --> 22:56.540
-I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I just need a minute.
-[Mark] Not at all.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.109
Let me show you
to the restroom.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.212
It's just down the hall
to the left.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.247
[sighs]

23:05.852 --> 23:08.719
Brenda Fletcher had
rope burns on her wrists.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.121
And she was a waitress.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.724
Looks like this creep
has a type.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.800
Maddy, thank you again

23:22.802 --> 23:25.002
for being willing to talk to
the court about your sister.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.470
I know it must be scary.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.305
You just want me to say
what a good sister she
is and stuff, right?

23:28.307 --> 23:30.040
Yes, exactly.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.942
We just want the judge
to understand that

23:31.944 --> 23:34.044
she's a good person
who did a dumb thing.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.248
Do you know why
she tried to steal that vase?

23:39.118 --> 23:42.653
Maddy, your sister is up
on some serious charges

23:42.755 --> 23:44.355
and if you tell me
why she did it,

23:44.423 --> 23:46.056
it might help with
the sentencing.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.264
So, how long have you
been skating?

23:53.332 --> 23:54.498
Since I was six.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.200
Looks like I'll make it
to nationals this year.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.002
What?

23:58.004 --> 24:00.604
That's amazing!
Congratulations! That's...

24:01.941 --> 24:03.607
Your sister must be
so proud of you.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.812
That's why she did it.

24:07.814 --> 24:11.115
We saw the vase on some
rich influencer's
social media post.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.417
Gloria thought it
would be a good thing to take
for a "Tick bait" challenge.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.419
-For a what?
-People livestream themselves

24:15.421 --> 24:16.921
doing stupid
or dangerous things...

24:16.923 --> 24:19.623
for clicks. The more clicks,
the more cash you get.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.425
When Gloria livestreamed
the burglary,

24:21.427 --> 24:24.428
it made enough money for me
to train and get to nationals.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.831
She's not a bad person,
it was just dumb game.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.935
-Right.
-[cell phone ringing]

24:30.937 --> 24:32.803
Um... I'm so sorry.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.705
Just excuse me
for one minute, okay?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.006
Yeah.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.346
[Emily] Right.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.248
Okay.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.551
It's time to go, Maddy.

24:48.621 --> 24:49.520
Ready?

24:51.357 --> 24:52.356
Good.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.226
When our parents died,

24:55.228 --> 24:57.661
the only thing I had left
was my sister and skating.

24:58.431 --> 24:59.530
Our foster parents are nice,

24:59.532 --> 25:01.699
but they can't
afford my training.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.502
So, we babysit, dogsit,
wash cars,

25:04.504 --> 25:05.736
anything to get us some money.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.738
Nationals is my big break.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.206
But if I qualify,

25:09.208 --> 25:11.208
we can't afford the entry fee,

25:11.210 --> 25:12.643
travel, costumes.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.913
She wasn't keeping it,
I swear.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.147
She was just trying to
help me.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.849
-Thank you, Maddy.
-You may step down.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.953
-I can't believe you did that.
-I did that

25:23.022 --> 25:26.123
to try to get you out in time
to see her skate in nationals.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.964
Your Honor, the only person
in the world

25:34.066 --> 25:36.333
who matters to Gloria
is Maddy.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.135
They are all they have left.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.538
And she was simply trying to
help her little sister

25:40.606 --> 25:41.906
fulfill a dream.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.208
Her intent was
never to hurt anyone.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.310
She did not know
that anyone was home

25:46.312 --> 25:48.412
and the gun was unloaded.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.947
It was
a "Tick bait" challenge,

25:49.949 --> 25:51.482
a modern day prank.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.118
I beg of you...

25:54.120 --> 25:57.454
please consider the child
beyond the crime.

25:59.025 --> 25:59.957
Mr. Blake?

26:01.427 --> 26:03.594
The prosecution rests
on the evidence.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.630
Gloria, is there anything
you wish to say?

26:06.632 --> 26:08.799
Just that I know it was
a really stupid thing to do.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.302
I'm sorry.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.938
The youth are our future,

26:13.940 --> 26:17.708
so we must treat them
regardless of their
current maturity level

26:17.710 --> 26:19.443
with respect and patience.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.412
In this case, however,

26:21.414 --> 26:23.113
Ms. Hernandez has squandered

26:23.115 --> 26:26.350
two previous opportunities
to correct her behavior.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.952
Understand this, young lady.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.854
I'm presenting you
with your very last chance

26:30.923 --> 26:32.723
to set yourself straight.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.858
So, don't blow it.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.327
Your sister needs you.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.530
I will allow Gloria Hernandez

26:39.532 --> 26:41.365
to remain a dual ward

26:41.433 --> 26:43.400
and remand her six months

26:43.402 --> 26:44.802
of probation camp.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.303
We are adjourned.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.946
Nice working with you.

26:56.015 --> 26:56.847
Well done.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.315
-[whispers]
-[Emily] Thank you.

27:02.555 --> 27:04.955
-Hey, could I ask a favor?
-Yeah.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.357
Could you keep an eye
on Maddy for me?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.827
-Sure, absolutely.
-Thanks.

27:24.510 --> 27:25.809
[man] All rise.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.511
Judge Lola Carmichael
presiding.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.348
You may be seated.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.853
On the record <i> People v.</i>
<i> Carl Brewer.</i>

27:35.921 --> 27:37.588
Parties are present
and represented

27:37.590 --> 27:39.123
and the jury is not present.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.124
-Mr. Callen.
-Your Honor,

27:40.126 --> 27:41.392
the people have
1101 evidence on

27:41.394 --> 27:42.526
-the issue of identity.
-What? Wait.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.228
Why am I just now
hearing about this?

27:44.230 --> 27:45.596
She was on the witness list,
Mr. Watkins

27:45.598 --> 27:47.431
and a preliminary statement
was in the discovery.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.401
We haven't been given
no notice that any potential
propensity evidence

27:50.403 --> 27:51.535
will come into on this trial.

27:51.537 --> 27:53.037
Mr. Callen, have you turned
over any new statements?

27:53.039 --> 27:54.071
[coughs]

27:59.211 --> 28:01.412
This is unacceptable.
This calls for misconduct.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.047
While I agree it's not ideal,

28:03.148 --> 28:05.049
I will allow the people
to bring the witness in

28:05.051 --> 28:06.650
and conduct a 402 hearing

28:06.752 --> 28:09.053
outside the presence
of the jury.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.387
It will allow Mr. Watkins

28:10.389 --> 28:12.156
the opportunity
to cross-examine her.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.059
Then, I will decide if she
will testify during trial.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.696
[Addison] <i> I told him</i>
<i> I was tired</i>

28:18.698 --> 28:19.730
<i> just to get out of there.</i>

28:20.733 --> 28:21.699
That's when he attacked me.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.400
Ms. Adison, did you
fear for your life?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.502
-I was sure he was
going to kill me.
-Objection!

28:25.504 --> 28:27.137
Relevance, motion to strike.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.505
Sustained and stricken.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.240
Thank you, Ms. Adison.
I know this wasn't
easy for you.

28:30.843 --> 28:31.842
Nothing further.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.044
Cross-examination.

28:36.115 --> 28:39.349
-[coughs]
-[Addison sobbing]

28:44.724 --> 28:46.056
How many drinks
did you have that night?

28:46.459 --> 28:48.225
Two, maybe.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.626
Maybe three, maybe four.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.831
-Maybe.
-And were you feeling
the effects of the alcohol?

28:55.134 --> 28:56.133
I guess so.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.901
And you testified that
you were in an alley.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.136
Was the alley dark?

28:59.204 --> 29:00.670
Yes.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.606
And you had never see
the person that did this
before that night?

29:02.608 --> 29:04.408
-No.
-So, your testimony

29:04.410 --> 29:05.609
is that you were positive

29:05.611 --> 29:07.611
the person you met
16 years ago

29:07.613 --> 29:10.647
at night, in a bar,
while feeling
the effects of alcohol,

29:10.716 --> 29:12.015
-was my client?
-Yes, I know.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.417
It was him.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.818
-He was the one.
-Do you have proof

29:14.820 --> 29:17.154
-or should we just trust you?
-[struggling] No,
he was the one.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.555
I know he was the one

29:18.657 --> 29:19.623
-to try to kill me.
-Your Honor, objection.

29:19.625 --> 29:20.958
-Argumentative.
-Sustained.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
Mr. Watkins, ease up.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.965
You want us to trust you.
So, tell us...

29:29.135 --> 29:31.001
did you testify that my client

29:31.003 --> 29:33.237
-drove a light blue Chevy?
-Yes.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.108
Marking defense, exhibit G,

29:38.110 --> 29:40.844
a certified DMV
registration record

29:40.846 --> 29:42.412
showing that my client

29:42.414 --> 29:44.815
never owned a blue Chevy.

29:54.260 --> 29:58.428
[instrumental music playing]

30:10.843 --> 30:12.409
-Hi!
-[chuckles] Hi.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.111
-How are you?
-I'm good.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.013
You too, come.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.748
-We just ordered
a delicious...
-[Lola] Okay.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.317
-...bottle of Bordeaux.
-I hope you don't mind me
crashing ladies night.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.752
-Not at all.
-[Rachel chuckles]

30:22.121 --> 30:23.420
Cheers!

30:23.422 --> 30:24.955
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.058
[Amy] We were just discussing
a mutual friend we have in DC.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.326
[chuckles] You okay?

30:29.628 --> 30:30.761
Mmm-hmm.

30:30.763 --> 30:32.863
She's in the middle of that
murder case with Mark.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.400
We should give her the bottle
with a straw.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.101
[all chuckling]

30:38.804 --> 30:40.103
Okay, well, you know what?

30:40.105 --> 30:42.105
Let's go find you a straw.

30:45.744 --> 30:48.245
Girl, I have known
you too long.

30:49.715 --> 30:50.814
What's wrong?

30:52.151 --> 30:54.017
This is gonna sound petty

30:54.019 --> 30:56.854
and selfish
and totally insane...

30:56.922 --> 30:57.721
Come on.

30:58.591 --> 30:59.656
Out with it.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.527
But even though I said
I was okay with it...

31:04.330 --> 31:05.829
I don't think I am.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.399
Lo, do you still have
feelings for Andre?

31:10.302 --> 31:12.135
Hey, sorry
to interrupt. But...

31:12.237 --> 31:13.637
-What?
-I have a nervous client

31:13.739 --> 31:14.837
who needs some hand holding.

31:14.839 --> 31:17.040
-Lola, it was really
good seeing you.
-Oh.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.210
Maybe we can catch up
next time I'm in town.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.012
That would be great.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.014
-I will walk you out.
-All right.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.360
What's all this?

31:36.428 --> 31:38.095
So, I got a bit sidelined

31:38.097 --> 31:41.164
when Lola denied our request
to introduce Charlene's
testimony in trial.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.900
But then I remembered
something Charlene said

31:42.902 --> 31:43.901
when she was on the stand.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.602
Um, okay, take it back.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.438
Brenda Fletcher, shot once
in the head and her body
dumped in the trash,

31:48.540 --> 31:50.240
-right?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.809
In Charlene's testimony
she said that Carl had
a rope in the back of his car.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.845
There are rope burns
on Brenda's wrists.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.347
Charlene also mentioned that
Carl asked about her hair.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.049
There's a lock of hair
missing from Brenda's head.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.451
Which the coroner thought was
torn out during the struggle.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.920
Yeah, but what if
it was intentional?

32:02.922 --> 32:04.922
You know, I've been going to
the cold cases all week?

32:04.924 --> 32:07.124
These four black women,
they were all killed
in different neighborhoods

32:07.126 --> 32:08.225
at different times,

32:08.327 --> 32:10.360
but they were killed
the exact same way, Tony.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.230
One shot to the head,
rope burns on their wrists,

32:13.232 --> 32:16.099
bodies dumped in the trash
with a lock of hair missing
from their heads.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.935
Jesus Christ, Mark,
you think we have

32:18.036 --> 32:19.503
a serial killer on our hands.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.204
I don't know yet, but...

32:21.206 --> 32:23.340
-One hell of a coincidence.
-We're gonna have to pave it.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.607
We're gonna have to ask
the jury...

32:24.676 --> 32:26.710
Tony, I'm out of continuances
and it'll take weeks.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.946
And we gotta investigate,
we gotta run DNA tests,

32:29.014 --> 32:30.213
-get warrants.
-Then you're gonna have to

32:30.215 --> 32:32.950
give the closing argument
of your career, otherwise...

32:34.119 --> 32:35.252
this guy could walk free.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.242
Okay!

32:59.244 --> 33:01.511
I believe we are to begin here
in closing arguments.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.814
That is if we don't have
any additional requests

33:03.816 --> 33:05.282
-or delays.
-People are ready to proceed.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.417
-We are ready if you are,
Your Honor.
-Then let's begin.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.921
So, the facts in this case
may seem complicated,

33:10.923 --> 33:13.256
but in fact, they're pretty
simple when we break it down.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.425
One, the defendant was seen
with the victim,

33:15.427 --> 33:17.694
Mrs. Brenda Fletcher
at her workplace

33:17.696 --> 33:19.730
in the days preceding
her disappearance.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.798
Two, the defendant owned
a nine millimeter weapon,

33:21.800 --> 33:25.435
the same caliber gun used
to end Ms. Fletcher's life.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.704
Three, the defendant
has no alibi

33:27.706 --> 33:29.306
for the day in which
Brenda Fletcher went missing.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.608
Four, the defendant clearly

33:31.610 --> 33:33.944
has anger issues
as we saw ourselves

33:33.946 --> 33:35.512
in this very courtroom.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.547
And five and most importantly,

33:37.616 --> 33:42.085
the defendant's DNA was found
on Brenda Fletcher's body.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.722
Now, it is true that
the defendant has
two distinct DNA markers.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.124
But that doesn't
change the fact

33:47.126 --> 33:49.726
that one of them
was found on the victim.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.329
When you add this all up,

33:52.331 --> 33:53.463
it is abundantly clear

33:53.532 --> 33:55.132
that the defendant,
Carl Brewer,

33:55.134 --> 33:56.199
is guilty of murder.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.413
Carl was seen in the same
South LA neighborhood

34:09.415 --> 34:11.048
because that
is where he lives.

34:12.317 --> 34:13.617
That doesn't
make him a killer.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.251
Carl spoke with Brenda

34:15.253 --> 34:17.320
when she took his drink order
once or twice.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.823
That doesn't
make him a killer.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.025
Carl once owned a gun

34:22.027 --> 34:24.828
and yes, he does at times
have a short temper.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.497
Doesn't make him a killer.

34:27.499 --> 34:30.100
This case is dripping
in reasonable doubt,

34:30.102 --> 34:33.036
because there is another man
that could be

34:33.038 --> 34:36.139
responsible for
Mrs. Fletcher's death.

34:36.208 --> 34:40.143
When Carl was 20, he received
a life-saving transplant,

34:40.245 --> 34:41.611
which, as it turns out,

34:41.613 --> 34:45.048
left him with two sets of DNA.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.818
Perhaps Carl's donor,

34:47.820 --> 34:49.219
another man from
the neighborhood,

34:49.221 --> 34:50.219
had a motive.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.756
Because Carl Brewer
certainly does not.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.259
And the people have not proven
beyond reasonable doubt

34:56.328 --> 34:58.061
that he did. Why?

34:59.465 --> 35:02.833
Because Carl Brewer
is not a killer.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.207
Has the jury reached
a verdict?

35:11.710 --> 35:12.709
We have, Your Honor.

35:17.850 --> 35:19.115
Thank you.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.800
"The people of the state
of California v. Carl Brewer,"

35:36.802 --> 35:38.502
we, the jury, in the above
entitled case

35:38.504 --> 35:40.203
find the defendant,
"Not guilty."

35:40.205 --> 35:42.506
Oh... oh.

35:56.922 --> 35:57.954
[sighs wearily]

35:57.956 --> 35:59.723
I know you're happy
with your new therapist,

35:59.725 --> 36:01.892
but I'm always
here for you too. Okay?

36:01.894 --> 36:04.828
Thanks, Sara. I really
appreciate you being
at my side this whole time.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.963
-I can't imagine having
to do it by myself.
-Darius.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.001
I just want to tell you,
I'm sorry for you loss.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.336
If your guy didn't do it,
I'm not gonna stop
till I find out who did.

36:17.109 --> 36:18.608
"Love does not
delight in evil,

36:18.610 --> 36:20.510
but rejoices with the truth."

36:21.113 --> 36:22.212
My mom's mantra.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.718
-Ready?
-Yeah.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.487
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

36:30.489 --> 36:31.755
-[man] Darius!
-[woman] Darius!

36:35.527 --> 36:36.526
Good work, Watkins.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.062
You too.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.336
Okay.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.004
I don't wanna know my future,

36:48.006 --> 36:50.607
but I do wanna know why
someone from my past
has come back into my life.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.809
Where's Ilani?

36:52.811 --> 36:54.110
She must've known
we were feeling uneasy
with her around,

36:54.112 --> 36:55.612
that I was considering
transferring her
to the courtroom,

36:55.614 --> 36:57.547
because she just left
her letter of resignation.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.350
Damn! That woman is good!

37:03.855 --> 37:04.821
Shit!

37:12.431 --> 37:14.130
[sighs]

37:54.806 --> 37:55.805
[clinks]

37:57.309 --> 38:00.944
[door opens]

38:00.946 --> 38:03.213
Okay, seriously? This has to
be our worst spot yet.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.115
Yeah, I really
miss the rooftop.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.217
I take that is case has been
keeping you up at night.

38:07.219 --> 38:08.885
Tell me I look
as bad as I feel?

38:08.887 --> 38:10.820
Protestors marching outside
the courthouse every day

38:10.822 --> 38:12.088
were right.

38:12.090 --> 38:15.725
There are so many women
of color that have been killed

38:15.727 --> 38:19.329
or disappeared
and without money, resources--

38:19.331 --> 38:20.430
We've just been
in the middle of a trial.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.065
Or if they don't look
a certain way,

38:22.133 --> 38:24.034
the media just
doesn't cover it.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.236
I'd like to think that
the media is doing their best,

38:26.305 --> 38:27.737
but you're right.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.739
White victims get spotlight

38:29.808 --> 38:31.207
more often
than women of color.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.043
More often?
This woman's murderer

38:33.045 --> 38:34.444
is still out there somewhere!

38:34.546 --> 38:37.314
Just like
the countless victims

38:37.316 --> 38:40.517
of unsolved,
uninvestigated crimes.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.620
The only hope I have
is that the media

38:43.622 --> 38:45.922
and law enforcement
and everyone

38:45.924 --> 38:48.325
will start treating
victims of color

38:48.327 --> 38:50.160
and specifically black women

38:50.228 --> 38:52.362
with the respect
and the resources

38:52.464 --> 38:54.631
and the urgency needed
to solve these crimes.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.632
I did my best, Lo.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.438
-I know you did.
-Can we just...

39:02.107 --> 39:03.339
switch the subject?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.142
-How's my
beautiful goddaughter?
-[chuckles softly]

39:06.812 --> 39:08.511
Miss Bailey is amazing.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.047
Her father is spiraling.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.717
-[chuckles]
-I found a long lens
on his camera

39:13.719 --> 39:15.952
and he's glued to
that Citizen app.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.654
That sounds like, he's just,
you know,

39:17.723 --> 39:18.822
misses his mommy group.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.123
I think he needs
some guy time.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.660
-Beer, a game... thank you.
-Sure.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.729
-Between him and Rach--
-Oh, you saw Rachel?

39:26.798 --> 39:28.264
I missed dinner with her
and Amy,

39:28.333 --> 39:29.933
but apparently Amy met her...

39:29.935 --> 39:32.702
hot-shot
DC attorney boyfriend.

39:33.438 --> 39:34.838
I think he...

39:34.906 --> 39:38.108
clerked for the same judge
you used to intern
for in DC...

39:38.110 --> 39:39.809
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.444
What's happening to your face?
You're sweating.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.713
Nothing's wrong with my face.
It's hot. We're in
a boiler room.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.948
It's not that hot, Lo.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.316
And the only time
I've seen you like this

39:46.318 --> 39:48.051
is when you used to
talk about...

39:48.720 --> 39:51.721
[chuckles] Holy shit!

39:52.624 --> 39:54.157
Andre is your "Dre."

39:54.259 --> 39:56.626
"Love of your life
from college" Dre, like...

39:57.529 --> 40:01.030
Mr. Might-ay, Might-ay!

40:01.032 --> 40:04.801
-[whispers] Yes.
-[chuckles]

40:05.804 --> 40:07.270
-Hi.
-Hey, hey.

40:07.272 --> 40:10.039
[chuckles] Mr. Watkins.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.809
Thank you again
for all of your hard work.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.944
-You have been a blessing.
-Just doing my job.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.947
Be there in a second.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.950
Hey, uh...

40:21.052 --> 40:23.319
My sister was right
to believe in you.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.521
And listen, I'm sorry

40:24.523 --> 40:25.822
I gave you such a hard time.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.024
You know, it's been
a lot to deal with.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.359
I'm just glad
the truth came out.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.829
"Love does not
delight in evil,

40:32.831 --> 40:34.831
but rejoices in the truth."

40:37.903 --> 40:39.536
Well, thank you
again, brother.
