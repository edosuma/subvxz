- Oh, no. They were for me.

and then bring

So, Steve, later today

02:05.834 --> 02:09.088
all around the perimeter,

02:05.834 --> 02:09.088
about five feet deep.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.548
That ought to keep

02:09.129 --> 02:11.548
the basement dry.

This house doesn't have

02:13.300 --> 02:14.551
a basement.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.677
No, it certainly

02:14.593 --> 02:15.677
does not.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.387
Okay.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.387
This is ridiculous.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.223
How long are you gonna let TJ

02:17.429 --> 02:20.223
think that he's the contractor?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.059
- To the very end, my friend.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.059
- This is stupid.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.477
We have to tell him

02:22.101 --> 02:23.477
the truth.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.228
No, look how happy

02:23.518 --> 02:25.228
he is strutting around

02:25.270 --> 02:27.064
in his tool belt and

02:25.270 --> 02:27.064
his shiny, silver helmet.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.524
You know, he polishes that thing

02:27.106 --> 02:29.524
every night after work.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.943
- Really?

02:29.566 --> 02:30.943
- Yes, really.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.444
With real silver polish.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
That's what he thinks

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
silver polish is for.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.407
To polish anything that's

02:34.529 --> 02:37.407
silver. I think that's adorable.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.868
And the good news is

02:37.449 --> 02:39.868
he's got terrible instincts

02:39.910 --> 02:43.038
but he combines that with

02:39.910 --> 02:43.038
absolutely zero follow-through

02:43.080 --> 02:44.372
so, it all works out

02:43.080 --> 02:44.372
in the end.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.333
Huh? terrible instincts,

02:44.414 --> 02:46.333
zero follow-through.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.460
in a good pretend contractor.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.674

02:53.715 --> 02:55.425

02:53.715 --> 02:55.425
an extra 10%

02:55.467 --> 02:58.219
to pretend he's not doing

02:55.467 --> 02:58.219

02:58.261 --> 02:59.680
but Tom

02:58.261 --> 02:59.680
is actually doing.

03:02.181 --> 03:04.852
with the circular saw.

What? Tom will get to him

03:04.893 --> 03:07.312
before he finds the on switch.

We're going

03:07.354 --> 03:08.981
to tell him.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.066
Luke, he is

03:09.023 --> 03:11.066
your brother-in-law.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.776
Just because Liz

03:11.108 --> 03:12.776
married him.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.904
Yeah, but this makes him happy,

03:12.818 --> 03:15.904
which makes Liz happy

03:15.946 --> 03:18.073
which will make you happy,

03:15.946 --> 03:18.073
which will make me happy.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.035
Well, just so you know, I'm

03:18.115 --> 03:21.035
gonna oversee this entire thing.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.162
Okay? I'm gonna make sure

03:21.076 --> 03:23.162

03:26.707 --> 03:28.416
and take a shower.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.335
- Why? Your shower's working.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.335
- Oh, well, yeah.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.090
- N-Nothing big.

Some of the guys

03:35.132 --> 03:36.758

03:41.889 --> 03:43.264
Joe, Joe saw you naked?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.558
- And Pete.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.558
- Pete?

03:44.599 --> 03:46.351
Well, Pete was with Joe,

03:44.599 --> 03:46.351
and then Slim--

03:46.393 --> 03:48.854
- Slim saw you naked?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.854
- Well, I could see him.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.605
So, I assumed

03:48.896 --> 03:50.605
he could see me.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.357
Billy had the best view.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.484
Just a straight shot

05:41.175 --> 05:42.926
nailing the 95 theses

05:41.175 --> 05:42.926
to a door.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.678
It's implying

05:42.968 --> 05:44.678
that I have no control

05:44.719 --> 05:46.721
over my hirelings

05:44.719 --> 05:46.721
at the DAR.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.182
I'm the president.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.850
The foliage on the right side

05:48.223 --> 05:49.850
of the door

05:49.891 --> 05:52.936
which looks fine, by the way,

05:49.891 --> 05:52.936
is my responsibility.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.147
This is a direct frontal assault

05:52.978 --> 05:55.147
on my leadership.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.982
'The woman's

05:55.189 --> 05:56.982
plotting a coup.'

05:57.024 --> 05:59.358
- This is Constance, right?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.358
- 'Constance Betterton.'

05:59.400 --> 06:01.444
Ever since

05:59.400 --> 06:01.444
the Masterson's Christmas party

06:01.486 --> 06:03.322
when I mentioned

06:01.486 --> 06:03.322
that Constance's husband

06:03.362 --> 06:06.658
sells used cars for a living,

06:03.362 --> 06:06.658
which he does, he calls them

06:06.700 --> 06:09.703
pre-owned, but they're used.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.703
She's had it in for me.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.872
She's gonna run against me

06:09.744 --> 06:11.872
in the next election.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.208
You don't try to oust

06:11.913 --> 06:14.208
a president of the DAR

06:14.249 --> 06:15.876
after one term,

06:14.249 --> 06:15.876
it's an insult!

06:15.917 --> 06:17.544
I think you will

06:15.917 --> 06:17.544
beat her handily.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.420
Did I tell you she tried

06:17.585 --> 06:19.420
to push me down the stairs once?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.298
Look, grandma,

06:19.462 --> 06:21.298
don't worry.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.175
You have someone

06:21.340 --> 06:23.175
on the inside now.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.343
I do, who?

06:24.383 --> 06:25.802
Me.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.888
Oh, yes.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.389
I'll keep an eye

06:27.929 --> 06:30.389
on Constance from now on.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.434
Let you know when she comes in,

06:30.431 --> 06:33.434
when she uses the computer

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
when she's inspecting

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
the landscaping.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.231
Well, that's wonderful!

06:37.272 --> 06:38.481
But stay out

06:37.272 --> 06:38.481
of the stairwell.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.482
Will do.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.571
Mm, raspberry.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.571
I like raspberry.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.618
- Twist ties?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.618
- Twist ties are over there.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.705
Is that bag half full

06:50.660 --> 06:53.705
or half empty, Jules?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.541
Oh, you're making me

06:53.747 --> 06:56.541
an optimist, my friend.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.043
- Rory?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.043
- Liza?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.669
- Rory?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.669
- No, we agreed.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.921
Not until the end

06:59.711 --> 07:00.921
of your shift.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.215
But I don't think

07:00.962 --> 07:03.215
the patch works on me.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.092
That is a billion milligrams

07:03.257 --> 07:05.092
of nicotine.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.218
Is that bad?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.095
Just go sit

07:06.260 --> 07:08.095
by the cooler

07:08.136 --> 07:10.055
have some water

07:08.136 --> 07:10.055
and take those off.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.766
- Problem?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.766
- No.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.934
I just told her

07:12.807 --> 07:13.934
to get some water.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.394
She seems

07:13.975 --> 07:15.394
really dehydrated.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.895
- Looks pretty good.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.895
- Yeah.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.355
I think we've hit

07:16.937 --> 07:18.355
a really good rhythm here.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.023
I've paired up

07:18.397 --> 07:20.023
Rinaldi and Spiro

07:20.065 --> 07:22.025
which worked out

07:20.065 --> 07:22.025
very efficiently.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.194
Sanderson got a little grumpy

07:22.067 --> 07:24.194
towards the end of the day

07:24.236 --> 07:25.528
but it's just 'cause

07:24.236 --> 07:25.528
he wants to be noticed

07:25.570 --> 07:27.822
and he is by far

07:25.570 --> 07:27.822
our best spearman.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.241
Also, we need

07:27.864 --> 07:29.241
to remember to pack

07:29.283 --> 07:31.201
a couple of extra

07:29.283 --> 07:31.201
trash spears tomorrow.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.245
The McFarland brothers

07:31.243 --> 07:33.245
are using the trash pickup

07:33.287 --> 07:35.205
to get out some

07:33.287 --> 07:35.205
of that pent-up aggression

07:35.247 --> 07:37.958
which is psychologically healthy

07:35.247 --> 07:37.958
but hard on the equipment.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.834
Got it.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.834
So, what's it looking like?

07:39.876 --> 07:41.628
Well, our quota's up,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.628
the kids are tired

07:41.669 --> 07:42.837
I think it's time

07:41.669 --> 07:42.837
to call it a day.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.214
Do it.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.633
Alright, everybody,

07:44.256 --> 07:46.633
let's bring it in!

07:46.674 --> 07:48.009
Hey, a bunch of the girls

07:46.674 --> 07:48.009
are going out

07:48.051 --> 07:49.219
for pizza,

07:48.051 --> 07:49.219
if you want to come.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.512
- I'll come.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.512
- Are you a girl?

07:51.554 --> 07:52.722
No.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.100
I would,

07:53.723 --> 07:55.100
but I can't.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.810
I've got a three-hour shift

07:55.142 --> 07:56.810
at the nursing home.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.395
I can't believe how much

07:56.851 --> 07:58.395
community service

07:58.437 --> 08:00.230
they stuck you with,

07:58.437 --> 08:00.230
what the hell did you do?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.440
I shot a man

08:00.272 --> 08:01.440
in Reno.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.482
[laughs]

08:02.523 --> 08:05.068
[coughs]

08:05.110 --> 08:06.278
Give it.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.115
[coughs]

08:10.157 --> 08:12.700
(Paris)

08:10.157 --> 08:12.700
'The truth is, this

08:10.157 --> 08:12.700
is the first time in my life'

08:12.742 --> 08:15.078
that I've consistently

08:12.742 --> 08:15.078
spent the night with a man.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.746
- Uh-huh.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.746
- I didn't know the rules.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.290
I mean, obviously,

08:16.788 --> 08:18.290
the clothes have to come off

08:18.332 --> 08:20.417
for the actual sex part

08:18.332 --> 08:20.417
of the evening, but afterward

08:20.459 --> 08:21.918
what are you

08:20.459 --> 08:21.918
supposed to do?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.628
I mean, nightgowns

08:21.960 --> 08:23.628
are obviously out

08:23.670 --> 08:25.213
but wearing nothing

08:23.670 --> 08:25.213
seems extreme

08:25.255 --> 08:27.132
and in case of fire,

08:25.255 --> 08:27.132
completely impractical.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.591
- Oh, sure.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.591
- I wore a camisole one night.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.010
It almost strangled me.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.261
And I'm not definitely

08:30.051 --> 08:31.261
a teddy girl

08:31.303 --> 08:32.804
so, what does that leave?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.014
Um, T-shirts.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.223
But what does a T-shirt

08:34.055 --> 08:35.223
say about me?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.058
Well--

08:37.100 --> 08:38.685
More importantly, what does

08:37.100 --> 08:38.685
it say to Doyle about me?

08:38.726 --> 08:39.978
Sweety, it's just

08:38.726 --> 08:39.978
a T-shirt.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.396
They don't tend

08:40.020 --> 08:41.396
to be that chatty.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.689
I don't know,

08:41.438 --> 08:42.689
maybe I should reconsider

08:42.730 --> 08:44.316
the completely naked option.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.444
After all, I'm 21.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.444
If not now, when?

08:47.486 --> 08:49.363
I mean, right now, my ass

08:47.486 --> 08:49.363
is probably as good

08:49.404 --> 08:50.405
as it's ever

08:49.404 --> 08:50.405
going to get.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.906
I should exploit

08:50.447 --> 08:51.906
that, right?

08:51.948 --> 08:54.242
Absolutely, buy

08:51.948 --> 08:54.242
a video camera, go to town.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
You know what?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
I'm starting to fade here.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
Oh, me too. Listen,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
it's been a terrific lunch.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.373
I think I'll get

08:58.163 --> 08:59.373
another espresso.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.623
Actually,

08:59.414 --> 09:00.623
we're out of espresso.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.666
- You are?

09:00.665 --> 09:01.666
- Yes.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.710
Uh, we shut

09:01.708 --> 09:03.710
the machine down

09:03.751 --> 09:05.379
at 3:00 to give

09:03.751 --> 09:05.379
it a rest.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.256
'cause it's Italian, so it's

09:05.420 --> 09:08.256
a little temperamental.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.385
Oh. Okay. Well, then,

09:08.298 --> 09:11.385
I guess I should--

09:11.426 --> 09:14.054
Go, really?

09:11.426 --> 09:14.054
Okay, well, hmm.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.223
Sweetie, it's been

09:14.095 --> 09:16.223
a blast, again.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.849
Okay. So, I guess

09:16.264 --> 09:17.849
I'll see you Tuesday.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.310
Yeah, Tuesday.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.310
Perfect. Can't wait.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.520
Okay.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.733
Is she gone?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.485
- Yes, she's gone.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.485
-<i> Thank God.</i>

09:28.527 --> 09:30.070
I can't believe you're in here

09:28.527 --> 09:30.070
hiding from a little girl.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.821
Oh, yes, you can.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.115
She has a tough exterior,

09:31.863 --> 09:34.115
but in the inside, Paris is--

09:34.157 --> 09:35.992
- Tokyo Rose.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.992
- She's lonely.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.827
She does not

09:36.034 --> 09:37.827
have a lot of friends.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.204
No, shocker!

09:39.246 --> 09:40.288
Sookie.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.832
No. No "Sookie".

09:40.330 --> 09:42.832
She's horrible.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.043
I mean, sh-sh-she sends

09:42.874 --> 09:45.043
everything back twice

09:45.085 --> 09:46.669
and she makes the waiters

09:45.085 --> 09:46.669
write down<i> exactly</i>

09:46.711 --> 09:48.629
what she wants me to know

09:46.711 --> 09:48.629
is wrong with the food.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.006
At least you're

09:48.671 --> 09:50.006
hidden in here.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.674
I'm out there,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.674
behind a desk

09:51.716 --> 09:53.552
exposed to all

09:51.716 --> 09:53.552
of her elements.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.220
- Michel.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.220
- She mocked my accent.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.846
She called me Canadian.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.765
It's enough already.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.765
I won't cook for her anymore.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.225
Lunches.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.394
- Twice a week for three weeks?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.394
- Yeah, creepy.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.811
The next thing you know,

10:02.436 --> 10:03.811
you'll be carrying

10:03.853 --> 10:05.813
Emmanuel Lewis

10:03.853 --> 10:05.813
around on your shoulders.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
We don't have time

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
for this, Lorelai.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.400
We have a wedding

10:07.065 --> 10:08.400
this week.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.817
A-And I've got

10:08.442 --> 10:09.817
a menu to plan

10:09.859 --> 10:11.194
and-and a cake

10:09.859 --> 10:11.194
to design.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.571
I don't have time

10:11.236 --> 10:12.571
to map out

10:12.612 --> 10:14.281
the fish patterns

10:12.612 --> 10:14.281
for my wild salmon.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.866
Okay, okay, I'm sorry

10:14.322 --> 10:16.866
she's bothering you guys.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.452
What can I do?

10:16.908 --> 10:18.452
I gave her my cellphone number.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.994
I told her to call.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.621
I just didn't think

10:20.036 --> 10:21.621
she'd use it<i> so often.</i>

10:21.662 --> 10:23.831
- Well, cut it off.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.831
- I feel sorry for her.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.333
No one likes

10:23.873 --> 10:25.333
to be pitied.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.210
Fine, I have to cut it off.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.210
I know. I will.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.087
- Do you promise?

10:27.252 --> 10:29.087
- I promise.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.298
Good, because I've got

10:29.129 --> 10:31.298
a lot of work to do.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.091
And we've got a ton

10:31.339 --> 10:33.091
of planning to do for this

10:33.133 --> 10:35.760
wedding next week and the menu's

10:33.133 --> 10:35.760
a mess and the cake..

10:35.802 --> 10:38.012
I was thinking about doing a red

10:35.802 --> 10:38.012
velvet cake but I don't know.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.722
And I'm using this wedding

10:38.054 --> 10:39.722
as a trial run

10:39.764 --> 10:41.391
so, it<i> has to be</i> perfect.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.726
- A trial run for what?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.726
- For<i> your</i> wedding.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.936
- Oh.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.936
- Yeah.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.480
- Which will be when?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.480
- What?

10:46.521 --> 10:47.855
- When?

10:46.521 --> 10:47.855
- When, what?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.441
When will you

10:47.897 --> 10:49.441
be getting married?

10:49.483 --> 10:51.901
- I'm gonna need a date.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.901
- Oh, we-we haven't set one yet.

10:51.943 --> 10:55.113
Well, I had Michel black out

10:51.943 --> 10:55.113
all of July for next year.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.490
You what?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.865
I figured you and Luke

10:56.531 --> 10:57.865
for an outdoorsy summer wedding.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.451
Who and Luke?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.369
July 23rd is my pick,

10:59.493 --> 11:01.369
but I am flexible.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.497
- Michel, unblack it out.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.497
- I told you.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.956
"I told you" what?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.291
I told her that you

11:04.998 --> 11:06.291
were not getting married.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.542
I am getting married.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.085
You were right.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.085
You called her.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.129
The woman can't commit

11:09.127 --> 11:11.129
to a purse, much less a man.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.380
I am getting married.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.549
I am so naive.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.549
I-I-I believed.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.010
- Live and learn.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.010
- Hey, I am getting married.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.803
I am.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.803
We will set a date.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.597
And we will get married

11:18.845 --> 11:20.597
<i>on that date.</i>

11:20.639 --> 11:21.973
And I've had

11:20.639 --> 11:21.973
the same purse

11:22.015 --> 11:23.350
for almost a year,

11:22.015 --> 11:23.350
thank you very much.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.644
Of course.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.644
My mistake.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.104
Now, let me go cancel

11:25.684 --> 11:28.104
your wedding plans.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.773
Those are not my wedding plans.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.773
They are Sookie's wedding plans.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.193
Well, fine, then!

11:30.815 --> 11:33.193
What are<i> your</i> wedding plans?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.653
They haven't

11:33.234 --> 11:34.653
been formalized yet.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.613
- What does that mean?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.613
- 'Sookie, come on.'

11:36.655 --> 11:37.947
I got men running

11:36.655 --> 11:37.947
around my house

11:37.989 --> 11:39.282
a completely destroyed bedroom

11:39.324 --> 11:40.908
things are crazy right now.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.327
When-When they calm down

11:42.369 --> 11:44.162
and Luke and I get

11:42.369 --> 11:44.162
a chance to breathe

11:44.204 --> 11:45.746
we will talk

11:44.204 --> 11:45.746
and set the date.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.624
Until then,

11:45.788 --> 11:47.624
will you drop it, please?

11:47.666 --> 11:49.708
- Fine. It's dropped.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.708
- She's back.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.002
- She's coming back!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.002
- No.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.379
- Why?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.379
- I don't know why.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.797
Maybe she left her phone

11:52.420 --> 11:54.797
or-or her spell book.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
All I know is she's heading

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
back toward the inn

11:56.299 --> 11:57.800
and I'm not going out

11:56.299 --> 11:57.800
until she leaves.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.302
Michel, you're

11:57.842 --> 11:59.302
being ridiculous.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.928
You're a grown man

11:59.344 --> 12:00.928
and you have a job to do.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.598
So do you. And I don't

12:00.970 --> 12:03.598
see you rushing out.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.309
Well, I can't. 'cause I'm not

12:03.640 --> 12:06.309
done with my coffee yet.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.728
- Hmm

12:06.351 --> 12:09.728
- Mm! Good to the last drop.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.066
[telephone ringing]

12:13.107 --> 12:15.443
Daughters of

12:13.107 --> 12:15.443
the American Revolution.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.986
Mrs. Tarkington, yes

12:17.028 --> 12:19.447
I've got your application

12:17.028 --> 12:19.447
right here.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.282
Sandra Tarkington.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.743
Um, I guess we just need

12:21.324 --> 12:24.743
to make a 100% sure

12:24.785 --> 12:26.580
that you're related

12:24.785 --> 12:26.580
to a verifiable patriot

12:26.621 --> 12:29.583
because we couldn't

12:26.621 --> 12:29.583
substantiate it on our end.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.334
Well, see,

12:29.624 --> 12:31.334
that's the thing.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.919
The fact that you found

12:31.376 --> 12:32.919
a musket in your

12:32.960 --> 12:34.921
great-uncle's attic doesn't

12:32.960 --> 12:34.921
necessarily mean

12:34.962 --> 12:37.632
you're related

12:34.962 --> 12:37.632
to a revolutionary war patriot.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.175
Yeah.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.177
'Unfortunately,

12:39.217 --> 12:41.177
even if your great-uncle Nate'

12:41.219 --> 12:43.971
'swore on your Aunt Kissy's

12:41.219 --> 12:43.971
grave that it was so.'

12:44.013 --> 12:47.934
'It's documented genealogy,

12:44.013 --> 12:47.934
preferably notarized.'

12:47.975 --> 12:50.729
Could you hold on

12:47.975 --> 12:50.729
for a moment?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.439
Psst, where's Julia?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
Slinked to the back after

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
I tore down Constance's letter.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.901
Good, 'cause I've got

12:55.358 --> 12:56.901
some gossip.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.404
My own little Valerie Plame.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.404
What's the news?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.615
Okay, so, I was at lunch

12:59.446 --> 13:01.615
with some of the girls

13:01.656 --> 13:03.866
and I started sniffing

13:01.656 --> 13:03.866
around, just casually

13:03.908 --> 13:06.536
asking if anyone had funny

13:03.908 --> 13:06.536
stories about Constance.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.329
You sly fox!

13:08.371 --> 13:11.165
So, one of the girls tells me

13:08.371 --> 13:11.165
that about three months ago

13:11.207 --> 13:12.833
she was in the office

13:11.207 --> 13:12.833
with Constance

13:12.875 --> 13:14.793
and as Constance

13:12.875 --> 13:14.793
was heading out for lunch

13:14.835 --> 13:16.504
she stumbled

13:14.835 --> 13:16.504
and dropped her purse

13:16.546 --> 13:18.757
and her Altoids box

13:16.546 --> 13:18.757
popped open, spilling out

13:18.797 --> 13:20.925
'enough funny-looking pills

13:18.797 --> 13:20.925
to fill a pharmacy.'

13:20.967 --> 13:23.219
Constance claimed

13:20.967 --> 13:23.219
that they were all vitamins.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.638
Julia didn't buy it.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.264
Because the minute

13:24.679 --> 13:26.264
the pills spilled out

13:26.306 --> 13:28.933
Constance threw herself

13:26.306 --> 13:28.933
on top of them to cover them up.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.227
A cover-up, that's good.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.227
That's what took Nixon down.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.730
Oh, this is so exciting!

13:31.269 --> 13:33.730
I love having a mole.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.732
We should go buy you

13:33.772 --> 13:35.732
a trench coat and fedora.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.275
I suggested to the girls

13:35.774 --> 13:37.275
that next week

13:37.317 --> 13:38.859
we invite

13:37.317 --> 13:38.859
Constance to lunch.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.612
Get a couple drinks in her

13:38.901 --> 13:40.612
and see what comes up.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.697
Who knew that behind

13:40.654 --> 13:42.697
such a sweet face

13:42.739 --> 13:44.324
lurked the soul of a spy?

13:44.365 --> 13:45.992
I prefer the term

13:44.365 --> 13:45.992
"Woman of mystery and intrigue."

13:46.033 --> 13:47.118
[cellphone rings]

13:47.160 --> 13:49.537
Excuse me.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.080
- Hello?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.080
- 'Rory.'

13:51.122 --> 13:53.374
- Oh, hey, Paris.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.374
- 'Hey, we need to talk.'

13:53.416 --> 13:54.875
- 'Is this a bad time?'

13:53.416 --> 13:54.875
- Okay.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.419
No, no, now's a fine time.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.419
What's up?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.463
Good. This hard-to-reach thing

13:56.461 --> 13:58.463
was getting old.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.838
'I'm all yours, Paris.'

13:59.880 --> 14:01.508
I have to put down

13:59.880 --> 14:01.508
a security deposit today

14:01.549 --> 14:03.134
by 5:00

14:01.549 --> 14:03.134
or we lose the place.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.469
- 'What place?'

14:03.176 --> 14:04.469
- Our place.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.471
- 'Our place where?'

14:04.511 --> 14:06.471
- Our off-campus place.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.806
You're hard to reach

14:06.513 --> 14:07.806
in a myriad of ways.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.182
Paris, we don't

14:07.846 --> 14:09.182
have a place.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.224
I'm not moving

14:09.223 --> 14:10.224
off campus with you.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.518
Why?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.060
'Because I no longer

14:11.559 --> 14:13.060
go to campus.'

14:13.102 --> 14:14.395
So, you're sticking

14:13.102 --> 14:14.395
with this

14:14.437 --> 14:15.814
"Not going to Yale"

14:14.437 --> 14:15.814
thing of yours?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.898
- Yes, I am.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.898
- 'Is this about the boat?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.400
How do you know

14:17.940 --> 14:19.400
about the boat?

14:19.442 --> 14:21.444
- Oh, come on. It's out there.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.444
- 'Out there?'

14:21.486 --> 14:23.321
<i>Why</i> is it out there?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.321
<i>How</i> is it out there?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.156
I read about it

14:23.363 --> 14:25.156
on Rebecca Thurston's blog.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.866
- You're kidding.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.866
- Dead serious.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.327
I thought Rebecca Thurston's

14:26.907 --> 14:29.327
blog was just about all the guys

14:29.369 --> 14:31.162
she has sex with and how much

14:29.369 --> 14:31.162
she hates her mother.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.955
That's true,

14:31.204 --> 14:32.955
but the boat you guys stole

14:32.997 --> 14:36.042
belongs to Dr. Daniel Zimmerman,

14:32.997 --> 14:36.042
whose son is Jason Zimmerman

14:36.083 --> 14:37.669
who Rebecca Thurston

14:36.083 --> 14:37.669
had sex with

14:37.711 --> 14:39.962
on her father's boat

14:37.711 --> 14:39.962
last semester.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.798
I can't believe

14:40.004 --> 14:41.798
I'm in the blogosphere.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.551
Hey, see for yourself. Just

14:41.840 --> 14:44.551
google "Rory Gilmore sex boat."

14:44.592 --> 14:46.010
Oh, my God.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.178
Is it true you and Logan

14:46.052 --> 14:47.178
tried to outrace

14:47.220 --> 14:48.888
the Connecticut coast guard?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.182
Rent the apartment, Paris.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.182
I'm not coming back to Yale.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.851
You know, you've put me

14:51.224 --> 14:52.851
in a very difficult position.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.143
Now, what if I end up

14:52.892 --> 14:54.143
renting the room

14:54.185 --> 14:56.103
to a rapist

14:54.185 --> 14:56.103
or a serial killer?

14:56.145 --> 14:59.148
I told you over<i> two</i> months ago

14:56.145 --> 14:59.148
that I was not coming back.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.150
And besides, I think

14:59.190 --> 15:01.150
Yale is pretty good

15:01.192 --> 15:03.277
about screening for rapists

15:01.192 --> 15:03.277
and serial killers.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.519
Sure. I get that.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.605
Tom, do other clients feed

- Nope.

Of course, the naked thing's

Alright, Tom,

Uh, anything you need

16:27.654 --> 16:29.196
to discuss before we go?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.824
No, we talked about everything

16:29.238 --> 16:30.824
but the kitchen.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.241
What about the kitchen?

16:32.283 --> 16:33.576
Well, do we want

16:32.283 --> 16:33.576
to make it bigger?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.035
Why would we want

16:33.618 --> 16:35.035
to make it bigger?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.621
Well, you might want

16:35.077 --> 16:36.621
a nice double oven

16:36.663 --> 16:38.832
'or a sub-zero freezer.'

16:38.873 --> 16:40.500
There's room enough

16:38.873 --> 16:40.500
for an island, uh..

16:40.541 --> 16:42.543
...and a cooking station

with some stools around it

16:42.585 --> 16:46.088

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633
Or maybe you want to cook

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633

16:48.675 --> 16:50.050
Thanksgiving or Christmas.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.260
The strange man

16:50.092 --> 16:51.260
is scaring me.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.471
I think

16:51.302 --> 16:53.471
the kitchen's fine, Tom.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.431
Okay, everybody

16:53.513 --> 16:55.431

16:55.473 --> 16:58.142

16:55.473 --> 16:58.142

Boy, what a trip.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.353

17:00.394 --> 17:02.396

17:06.400 --> 17:09.028
I gotta tell you, I don't see

17:06.400 --> 17:09.028
what's so special about it.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.697
It looks an awful

17:09.069 --> 17:10.697

17:10.738 --> 17:12.365

17:10.738 --> 17:12.365
lying around here.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.117
Well, that's the beauty

17:12.406 --> 17:15.117
of the mystic hammer, TJ.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.620
It looks the same,

17:15.159 --> 17:17.620
but it's completely different.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.873
Tom, make sure those cans

17:17.662 --> 17:19.873
are cleaned up out there, okay?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.081
Oh, my God. Enough with the

17:19.914 --> 17:21.081
paint cans, already.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.500

17:21.123 --> 17:22.500

17:22.542 --> 17:23.960
Don't worry, Luke.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.960
I'll take care of it.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.296
Hey, did you guys know

17:24.002 --> 17:27.296
there was a room back here?

17:27.338 --> 17:29.382
Oh, yeah, look at this,

17:27.338 --> 17:29.382
a whole room!

17:29.423 --> 17:31.091
- What a find, huh?

- 'TJ.'

17:33.678 --> 17:35.847

17:35.889 --> 17:38.140
Yeah, we don't want

17:35.889 --> 17:38.140
a huge kitchen, TJ.

17:38.182 --> 17:42.102
Or you could turn it into

17:38.182 --> 17:42.102
a weight room or a workshop.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.739

20:30.604 --> 20:32.065
Just leave money

20:30.604 --> 20:32.065
for gas.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.858
We'll have money for gas, guys.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.858
Don't worry.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.070
Let's drink this in, the last

20:33.900 --> 20:37.070
night of our first tour.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.988
(male #2)

20:37.111 --> 20:38.988
'I can't believe it's over.'

20:39.030 --> 20:40.447
I can't believe we survived.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.452
You got it, Pastor Tim.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.452
We got to break it down, guys.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.205
They want to start setting up

20:45.494 --> 20:47.205
for bible study, tomorrow

20:47.246 --> 20:50.750
and they need the stage

20:47.246 --> 20:50.750
for their big crucifix.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.756
Okay, here we go.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.756
Ah!

20:56.797 --> 20:59.299
Oh, what is that?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.299
And where can I get one?

20:59.341 --> 21:02.261
That is my dark chocolate

20:59.341 --> 21:02.261
s'mores wedding cake.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.847
- You've been reading my diary.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.847
- I got the idea in a dream.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.266
I was back in cooking school

21:04.889 --> 21:07.266
and late for my final

21:07.307 --> 21:08.935
and I run over to an oven,

21:07.307 --> 21:08.935
and I open it

21:08.976 --> 21:11.104
and sitting there

21:08.976 --> 21:11.104
is this s'mores wedding cake.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.189
And I present it to my teacher,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.189
he starts weeping

21:13.231 --> 21:15.566
and the whole class

21:13.231 --> 21:15.566
is applauding and cheering.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.235
- That's so nice.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.235
- Yeah.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.153
And then, of course

21:17.276 --> 21:19.153
Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise

21:19.195 --> 21:20.487
come leaping

21:19.195 --> 21:20.487
out of the cake

21:20.529 --> 21:22.531
screaming about how

21:20.529 --> 21:22.531
<i>amazing</i> it is.

21:22.573 --> 21:23.699
So, that made

21:22.573 --> 21:23.699
the whole thing

21:23.741 --> 21:25.576
a little creepy, but up until

21:23.741 --> 21:25.576
then..

21:25.618 --> 21:28.370
Look, you've got a marshmallow

21:25.618 --> 21:28.370
bride and groom on the top.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.789
- You think they'll like it?

21:28.412 --> 21:29.789
- I do.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.207
You think

21:29.830 --> 21:31.207
<i>you'll</i> like it?

21:31.249 --> 21:32.499
Look, Captain Ahab.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.501
- Come on, set the date.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.501
- I will.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.962
Is there something

21:34.543 --> 21:35.962
you're not telling me?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.589
Because agreeing to marry

21:36.003 --> 21:38.589
somebody is just as big

21:38.631 --> 21:40.424
a commitment as actually

21:38.631 --> 21:40.424
marrying them.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.593
- So don't think it's not.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.593
- I am committed.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.344
And you should be, so..

21:44.386 --> 21:46.139
This isn't a joking matter,

21:44.386 --> 21:46.139
missy.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.473
I want your wedding

21:46.180 --> 21:47.473
to be perfect

21:47.514 --> 21:48.933
or I want nothing

21:47.514 --> 21:48.933
to do with it.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.726
Oh, really?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.726
Wow, that might be a problem.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.771
'Cause I was really hoping for

21:50.768 --> 21:53.771
one of those disastrous weddings

21:53.813 --> 21:56.607
where we lose both rings

21:53.813 --> 21:56.607
minutes before the ceremony

21:56.649 --> 21:58.484
and I get a nose bleed

21:56.649 --> 21:58.484
as I'm walking down the aisle.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.986
And then later at the reception

22:00.027 --> 22:01.570
Luke is found

22:00.027 --> 22:01.570
in the coat check room

22:01.612 --> 22:03.530
Jude Law-ing it

22:01.612 --> 22:03.530
with one of the bridesmaids.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.491
Hey, I just received a call

22:03.572 --> 22:05.491
that the wedding party

22:05.532 --> 22:07.243
will not be getting in

22:05.532 --> 22:07.243
until midnight

22:07.285 --> 22:09.954
and someone will need

22:07.285 --> 22:09.954
to be here to greet them.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.872
I would do it,

22:09.996 --> 22:11.872
but I don't want to.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.126
- Alright, I'll do it.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.126
- Very well. I'll leave the..

22:15.168 --> 22:17.503
- Wait. Do you feel that?

22:15.168 --> 22:17.503
- Feel what?

22:17.544 --> 22:21.257
An icy chill as if something

22:17.544 --> 22:21.257
sinister is approaching.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.009
What?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.885
<i>[humming "Witch's Theme"</i>

22:23.050 --> 22:24.885
<i>from "The Wizard Of Oz"]</i>

22:24.927 --> 22:26.470
Gee, Michel, is Paris here?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.597
Maybe she was coming up

22:26.512 --> 22:28.597
the walk when I fled.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.600
- Where are you going?

22:28.639 --> 22:31.600
- In the opposite direction.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.146
Paris? Paris is here?

22:31.642 --> 22:35.146
Oh, I get the humming now.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.815
[chuckles]

22:35.188 --> 22:37.815
What is she doing here?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.608
- We're having lunch.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.608
- Really?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.527
- Ordering pizza, are you?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.527
- No, Sookie.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.321
I'm breaking up with her

22:41.568 --> 22:43.321
today, alright?

22:43.361 --> 22:46.157
I'm ending it like I promised,

22:43.361 --> 22:46.157
so back off.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.909
Grilled chicken and fries.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.909
That is all I'm making.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.870
- Thank you.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.870
- 'Go, hurry up. Come on.'

22:50.911 --> 22:54.581
Move it, move it. Go.

22:50.911 --> 22:54.581
Let's go. Come on, hurry.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.583
Apparently,

22:54.623 --> 22:56.583
the eagle has landed.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.880
Paris, hi.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.880
Good to see you.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.631
You look good.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.631
Something different?

23:02.673 --> 23:05.218
I accidently sprayed gasoline on

23:02.673 --> 23:05.218
myself at the service station.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.261
Well, that must be it.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.261
Come on, let's sit.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.847
Sorry, I'm late,

23:07.303 --> 23:09.847
I was interviewing roommates.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.389
And all I can say

23:09.889 --> 23:11.389
is build an ark

23:11.431 --> 23:13.267
'cause it is seriously

23:11.431 --> 23:13.267
time for a flood.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.353
Oh, well,

23:13.309 --> 23:15.353
you want some iced tea?

23:15.393 --> 23:17.188
I mean, forget

23:15.393 --> 23:17.188
the concept of intelligence

23:17.230 --> 23:19.690
or even a simple act

23:17.230 --> 23:19.690
of carrying on a conversation.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.775
These people can't type

23:19.732 --> 23:21.775
a reference sheet.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.194
I mean, they all have

23:21.817 --> 23:23.194
questionable morals

23:23.236 --> 23:25.321
a complete distrust

23:23.236 --> 23:25.321
of soap products.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.530
In the glass,

23:25.363 --> 23:26.530
out of the glass.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.325
It's all just

23:26.572 --> 23:29.325
semantics to you, right?

23:29.367 --> 23:31.035
Oh, well, I'm sure

23:29.367 --> 23:31.035
you'll find someone.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.912
- You just have keep looking.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.912
- I guess.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.247
Classes start next week

23:34.288 --> 23:35.622
and things are already

23:34.288 --> 23:35.622
getting crazy.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.541
Yeah, boy.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.877
- You sound really busy, Paris.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.877
- I am.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.754
You know, I feel

23:39.919 --> 23:41.754
a little bad dragging you

23:41.795 --> 23:44.257
all the way out here when

23:41.795 --> 23:44.257
you have so much on your plate.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.384
I mean, talk about

23:44.298 --> 23:46.384
self-centered, huh?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.552
Think about someone else

23:46.424 --> 23:48.552
for a change, Lorelai.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.762
Oh, that's okay.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.722
You know, I'll be totally fine

23:51.764 --> 23:53.724
if you need to cut back

23:51.764 --> 23:53.724
on our lunches.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.226
- Cut back?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.226
- Cut back, cut out.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.769
Whatever you need,

23:55.268 --> 23:56.769
it's fine with me.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.436
You know, this all sucks.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.814
I wouldn't even be in this

23:58.478 --> 24:00.814
position if it weren't for Rory.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.942
She was supposed to room

24:00.856 --> 24:02.942
with me. It was all planned out.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.069
I even called her yesterday

24:02.983 --> 24:05.069
and gave her one more chance

24:05.111 --> 24:06.444
to change her mind, but no.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.738
You talked to Rory yesterday?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.447
Yeah, I called her

24:07.780 --> 24:09.447
at the office.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.033
Office? What office?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.993
- Her office.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.993
- She has an office?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.370
- What is she doing?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.370
- I don't know.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.871
- Her job.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.871
- What job?

24:15.913 --> 24:18.374
Some job in an office

24:15.913 --> 24:18.374
with her grandmother.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.833
Well, her grandmother

24:18.416 --> 24:19.833
does not have an office.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.419
Well, that's where I called her.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.254
This makes no sense to me at

24:21.459 --> 24:23.254
all. What did it sound like?

24:23.296 --> 24:24.880
- An office.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.880
- Yes, I know an office.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.548
But were there

24:24.922 --> 24:26.548
specific office sounds?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.384
- I think I heard a fax machine.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.384
- A fax machine?

24:28.426 --> 24:29.509
Are you sure

24:28.426 --> 24:29.509
it was a fax machine?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.137
Pretty sure.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.805
Were there people talking or

24:31.178 --> 24:32.805
traffic? Did you hear traffic?

24:32.846 --> 24:34.265
'Cause that could

24:32.846 --> 24:34.265
give us a location.

24:34.307 --> 24:37.017
The city,

24:34.307 --> 24:37.017
the county or what?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.644
So, that's what

24:37.059 --> 24:38.644
this is all about.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.396
You're using me

24:38.685 --> 24:40.396
to get to Rory.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.688
Oh, Paris.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.065
You're pumping me

24:41.730 --> 24:43.065
full of espresso

24:43.107 --> 24:44.524
and pumping me

24:43.107 --> 24:44.524
for information.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.278
No, that is not true.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.278
I'm not pumping. No pumping.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.529
- We're completely pump-free.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.529
- I'm so stupid.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.614
I mean, why else

24:49.571 --> 24:50.614
would you wanna have

24:50.656 --> 24:52.532
biweekly lunches with me?

24:52.574 --> 24:55.119
There are many, many reasons.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.413
And they will come to me

24:55.161 --> 24:57.413
just in a second.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.915
I'm blind.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.915
I walk blindly through life.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.792
No. Now, you're not blind.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.169
I'll leave.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.169
I'll go right now.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.795
Oh, Paris, please.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.795
I'm sorry.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.546
You just mentioned Rory, and

25:04.837 --> 25:06.546
a thing went off in my brain.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.007
It's just, uh, a mother thing.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.260
But I love our lunches.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.260
I really do. Please stay.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.721
- Are you sure? Because I--

25:11.302 --> 25:14.721
- Yes, I'm completely positive.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.683
Everything's good.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.683
Now, won't you sit down?

25:19.977 --> 25:22.188
How does chicken sound, okay?

25:22.229 --> 25:25.149
Okay. Just not too dry.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.109
Okay.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.444
[sighs]

25:31.947 --> 25:33.491
The service here sucks.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.744
[jazz music]

25:41.332 --> 25:43.125
Very smooth, Mr. Hollister.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.045
That was the Suzie Q

25:43.167 --> 25:46.045
right into the Shorty George.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.713
I thought it looked familiar.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.257
And after this song,

25:47.754 --> 25:50.257
I'll take you for a twirl.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.801
Oh, I hope

25:50.299 --> 25:52.801
I can keep up.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.804
Watch those hands, Mr. Fink.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.014
[record skipping]

25:57.056 --> 25:59.433
I'm on it.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.519
You know, I can get this

25:59.475 --> 26:01.519
for you guys on CD.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.062
[all laughing]

26:03.103 --> 26:06.399
Oh, now, come on.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.399
It wasn't that funny.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.650
Oh, my God.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.650
Hey, stranger!

26:08.692 --> 26:10.568
And hello to you.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.696
Watch those hands,

26:10.610 --> 26:12.696
Miss Gilmore.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.199
Touche, Mr. Fink.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.199
What are you doing here?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.825
Well, I was in Copenhagen

26:15.241 --> 26:16.825
this morning

26:16.867 --> 26:18.702
and then I remembered I have

26:16.867 --> 26:18.702
a four o'clock mambo class.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.787
Oh, I'm so glad you're back.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.787
How was Europe?

26:20.829 --> 26:23.040
- Same as it was last year.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.040
- What did you do?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.292
Long, embarrassing story.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.292
I'll tell you later.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.503
Okay. Oh, wait. Hold on.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.049
Okay, everyone, it is time

26:29.463 --> 26:32.049
for cake and punch.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.133
[all groaning]

26:33.175 --> 26:34.968
It's only a 15 minute break

26:35.010 --> 26:36.594
and then it's back

26:35.010 --> 26:36.594
to the dance floor.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.930
So you're Arthur Murray now?

26:37.971 --> 26:40.140
No, I don't have

26:37.971 --> 26:40.140
that much training.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.184
No, their dance teacher

26:40.182 --> 26:42.184
has an inner ear infection.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.978
I'm just filling in. My job is

26:42.226 --> 26:44.978
to make sure nobody falls down.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.522
And what if somebody does?

26:46.564 --> 26:47.981
That's what the panic button

26:46.564 --> 26:47.981
is for.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.525
[chuckles]

26:49.567 --> 26:52.194
So when does this crazy

26:49.567 --> 26:52.194
rock 'n' roll party wrap up?

26:52.236 --> 26:53.946
Another 45 minutes.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.406
But if you get yourself

26:53.987 --> 26:55.406
some cake and punch

26:55.448 --> 26:57.657
it will only seem like 40.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.619
- I missed you.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.619
- That was my plan.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.163
[chuckles]

27:06.624 --> 27:09.002
- Thank you.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.002
- You're welcome.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.923
[sighs]

27:11.130 --> 27:12.923
I missed this.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.425
Me too.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.051
Oh, so you, Colin, and Finn

27:16.093 --> 27:17.761
didn't do a lot of cuddling

27:16.093 --> 27:17.761
in Europe?

27:17.803 --> 27:20.013
Nah, mostly just hand-holding.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.182
So, is there any official record

27:20.055 --> 27:22.182
of this trip

27:22.224 --> 27:24.393
or was all evidence

27:22.224 --> 27:24.393
confiscated at the airport?

27:24.435 --> 27:26.853
- I got pictures.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.853
- Yeah? Can I see?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.272
Hand me that.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.443
Now, you realize

27:29.940 --> 27:32.443
if I show you mine

27:32.485 --> 27:33.777
you have to show me yours.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.988
You saw mine about five minutes

27:33.819 --> 27:35.988
ago, mister.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.198
Oh, I hate it

27:36.029 --> 27:38.198
when you work blue.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.575
Okay.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.953
Here's Colin

27:39.617 --> 27:42.953
sleeping on the train.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.914
And here's Finn shoving

27:42.995 --> 27:45.914
carrot sticks up Colin's nose

27:45.956 --> 27:47.458
as Colin sleeps

27:45.956 --> 27:47.458
on the train.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.209
- Very mature.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.209
- We try.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.129
- This is Gloucester, England.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.129
- It's pretty.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.090
Where we attended the famous

27:52.171 --> 27:55.090
Gloucester Cheese-Rolling

27:55.132 --> 27:57.510
Festival, a time-honored

27:55.132 --> 27:57.510
tradition where fine, brave men

27:57.551 --> 28:00.179
such as myself climb to the top

27:57.551 --> 28:00.179
of a hill with a large wheel

28:00.220 --> 28:02.473
of cheese and then proceed

28:00.220 --> 28:02.473
to push it and run after it

28:02.515 --> 28:03.807
as it rolls all the way down.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.852
Shut up. Why would you

28:03.849 --> 28:06.852
commit that to film?

28:06.893 --> 28:08.521
That's me, that's Colin

28:08.562 --> 28:10.230
that's Finn,

28:08.562 --> 28:10.230
and that is the cheese.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.732
So if you beat your cheese

28:10.272 --> 28:12.732
to the bottom of the hill

28:12.774 --> 28:14.692
are you disqualified,

28:12.774 --> 28:14.692
or do you win?

28:14.734 --> 28:16.028
There are no winners or losers

28:16.069 --> 28:17.737
in the Gloucester

28:16.069 --> 28:17.737
Cheese-Rolling Festival.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.823
Well, there certainly

28:17.779 --> 28:19.823
aren't any winners.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.451
- Tell me about it.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.451
- Who's that?

28:22.493 --> 28:24.286
Ah, now, that's the love

28:22.493 --> 28:24.286
of Colin's life.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.039
- Colin fell in love?

28:24.328 --> 28:27.039
- Yeah, he met her in Holland.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.957
She doesn't speak a word

28:27.080 --> 28:28.957
of English so she has no idea

28:28.999 --> 28:30.501
how incredibly annoying

28:28.999 --> 28:30.501
she finds him.

28:30.543 --> 28:33.128
- What's with the outfit?

28:30.543 --> 28:33.128
- She's a milkmaid.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.297
- Stop.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.297
- She has cows. She has pails.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.007
Colin fell in love

28:35.339 --> 28:37.007
with a milkmaid?

28:37.049 --> 28:39.593
It's pretty serious too,

28:37.049 --> 28:39.593
he ditched us and followed her

28:39.635 --> 28:41.679
to Amsterdam where they've

28:39.635 --> 28:41.679
been hold up ever since.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.138
We haven't heard a word

28:41.720 --> 28:43.138
from him.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.765
I mean, we assume

28:43.180 --> 28:45.765
he's gonna be back by the time..

28:47.017 --> 28:49.311
By the time what?

28:49.353 --> 28:53.357
By the time the cows come home?

28:49.353 --> 28:53.357
What?

28:53.399 --> 28:56.860
By the time...school starts?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.195
[sighs]

28:58.237 --> 28:59.405
What?

28:59.446 --> 29:01.323
- What's the matter?

28:59.446 --> 29:01.323
- Nothing.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.325
Logan, you can

29:01.365 --> 29:03.325
mention school to me.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.910
I don't wanna bum you out.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.496
Logan, that is ridiculous.

29:07.538 --> 29:11.625
I'm fine.

29:07.538 --> 29:11.625
I mean, look..

29:11.667 --> 29:15.588
Yale was a wonderful chapter

29:11.667 --> 29:15.588
in my life, but I've moved on.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.548
I have my work.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.548
I have my new pad.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.799
I'm just really happy

29:17.590 --> 29:19.799
with where I am right now.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.218
Really?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.803
Logan, you don't have

29:21.260 --> 29:23.803
to feel weird about this.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.805
You go to Yale.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.805
Your friends go to Yale.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.307
How can we not talk about Yale?

29:27.349 --> 29:29.059
- I don't know.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.059
- Exactly.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.730
So we both agree that the topic

29:29.101 --> 29:32.730
of Yale can never be off-limits.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.815
Okay, fine, well, if you're so

29:32.771 --> 29:35.815
cool with it then why don't you

29:35.857 --> 29:37.651
come meet me at Yale tomorrow

29:35.857 --> 29:37.651
and I can show you

29:37.693 --> 29:39.278
my new apartment,

29:37.693 --> 29:39.278
maybe take you to lunch?

29:39.319 --> 29:42.698
I can't tomorrow, because I have

29:39.319 --> 29:42.698
my DAR induction luncheon.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.241
Well, then, how about breakfast?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.910
Breakfast sounds good.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.955
I have to say, Ace,

29:46.952 --> 29:49.955
I like the new digs.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.249
Yeah, it's really nice, huh?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.084
You haven't even seen

29:52.291 --> 29:54.084
the bedroom yet.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.545
- Oh, wow.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.545
- What?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.004
Okay, fine,

29:56.587 --> 29:58.004
but don't think that

29:58.046 --> 29:59.881
this is gonna work

29:58.046 --> 29:59.881
a second time.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.427
Uh, no, Logan,

29:59.923 --> 30:03.427
I, I didn't mean..

30:03.469 --> 30:05.512
No, I seriously meant that

30:03.469 --> 30:05.512
you hadn't seen the bedroom yet.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.055
You're making me feel cheap,

30:05.554 --> 30:07.055
Ace.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.098
Logan!

30:08.140 --> 30:11.477
I swear I wasn't working blue.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.813
- 'Come on, let's go!'

30:11.518 --> 30:14.813
- Martha's thirsty, guys.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.149
- I hate that he named the van.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.149
- I think it's cute.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.817
Hey, you're not pumping premium,

30:17.190 --> 30:18.817
right?

30:18.858 --> 30:20.402
It's the cheap stuff, bro.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.402
Don't worry.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.613
Yeah, well, you said that

30:20.444 --> 30:22.613
before, and you pumped premium

30:22.655 --> 30:24.448
and it meant no snack stop

30:22.655 --> 30:24.448
in Philadelphia.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.159
- Whoa ho ho!

30:24.490 --> 30:27.159
- What, Gil?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.536
I was just watching the numbers

30:27.200 --> 30:29.536
spin by on the gas pump

30:29.578 --> 30:32.914
dial thingy here getting bigger

30:29.578 --> 30:32.914
and bigger, and I was thinking

30:32.956 --> 30:34.708
what if that was counting

30:32.956 --> 30:34.708
all the people in the world

30:34.750 --> 30:37.002
who were, like, dying,

30:34.750 --> 30:37.002
you know?

30:37.043 --> 30:38.754
So it's all these dead dudes

30:37.043 --> 30:38.754
spinning by?

30:38.796 --> 30:41.006
Every day with him is like

30:38.796 --> 30:41.006
being on "Meet The Press."

30:41.047 --> 30:42.758
[sighs]

30:41.047 --> 30:42.758
I can't feel my legs.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.051
- Well, move around a little.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.051
- Your amp's on my foot.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.970
Look, I'm no better off

30:45.093 --> 30:46.970
than you are, Brian.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.681
My guitar case is jammed

30:47.012 --> 30:48.681
against my thigh.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.808
I got a cymbal stand

30:48.722 --> 30:50.808
sticking in my pancreas.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.353
Guys, we are an hour out

30:50.849 --> 30:54.353
of Stars Hollow. Hang in there.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.563
God, the smell of that gas

30:54.394 --> 30:56.563
is making me hungry.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.398
- Gil, hurry!

30:56.605 --> 30:58.398
- I'm coming.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.944
Alright.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.904
It's the last

31:02.986 --> 31:04.904
of the gas money

31:04.946 --> 31:07.866
so this better

31:04.946 --> 31:07.866
get us home.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.034
[engine revving]

31:09.075 --> 31:11.328
Everybody, lean forward.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.081
(Lane)

31:13.789 --> 31:15.081
'Gil, where did you

31:13.789 --> 31:15.081
put the map?'

31:15.123 --> 31:17.000
It's, uh..

31:17.042 --> 31:21.296
- You're okay to drive, right?

31:17.042 --> 31:21.296
- Yeah, sure, I'm just..

31:21.338 --> 31:23.006
Dude, don't do that thing

31:21.338 --> 31:23.006
where you don't finish

31:23.048 --> 31:24.633
your sentences,

31:23.048 --> 31:24.633
it freaks me out.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.511
- I'll try. I'm just...ugh.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.511
- Come on.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.596
I guess I'm just weak

31:27.553 --> 31:29.596
from hunger.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.057
The guy I got gas from,

31:29.638 --> 31:32.057
I was talking to him

31:32.098 --> 31:34.226
and he suddenly turned

31:32.098 --> 31:34.226
into a giant turkey leg.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.519
(Brian)

31:34.267 --> 31:35.519
'Please don't mention food.'

31:35.561 --> 31:37.062
Let's think good thoughts

31:35.561 --> 31:37.062
here, guys.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.647
Picture yourself at home, okay?

31:38.689 --> 31:40.315
Home at last. What's the first

31:38.689 --> 31:40.315
thing you're gonna do?

31:40.357 --> 31:43.193
- Eat.

31:40.357 --> 31:43.193
- Wash my hair.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.779
Hug the kids, set them up in

31:43.235 --> 31:45.779
front of a "Harry Potter" movie

31:45.821 --> 31:48.323
and then do my wife

31:45.821 --> 31:48.323
for, like an hour.

31:48.365 --> 31:52.118
Uh, look, guys, uh,

31:48.365 --> 31:52.118
I've got an announcement

31:52.160 --> 31:54.120
kind of in my capacity

31:52.160 --> 31:54.120
as band manager

31:54.162 --> 31:56.122
and I think it's gonna

31:54.162 --> 31:56.122
cheer you up a lot.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.708
What?

31:57.750 --> 32:00.919
Well, as you know, each gig

31:57.750 --> 32:00.919
paid us a little something

32:00.960 --> 32:04.047
and we stayed free at people's

32:00.960 --> 32:04.047
houses along the way

32:04.089 --> 32:05.883
and we sold a decent amount

32:04.089 --> 32:05.883
of T-shirts

32:05.924 --> 32:09.302
so besides food, which

32:05.924 --> 32:09.302
we consumed in moderation

32:09.344 --> 32:11.388
there were days that

32:09.344 --> 32:11.388
we spent practically nothing.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.014
Yeah?

32:13.056 --> 32:16.727
Well, I wanted us to come out

32:13.056 --> 32:16.727
of this tour with something

32:16.769 --> 32:19.938
so I figured the best way

32:16.769 --> 32:19.938
to motivate us to save

32:19.979 --> 32:22.023
would be to fib a little

32:19.979 --> 32:22.023
on how much we had.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.316
You fibbed a little?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.985
Actually, a lot,

32:23.358 --> 32:25.985
but it paid off big, guys

32:26.027 --> 32:29.197
because we're going home

32:26.027 --> 32:29.197
with, uh, over $9,000.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.783
[gasps]

32:30.824 --> 32:34.411
Huh? Nine thousand dollars.

32:30.824 --> 32:34.411
American dollars.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.746
Why aren't you guys

32:34.453 --> 32:35.746
jumping up and down?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.497
Besides the fact

32:35.788 --> 32:37.497
that my spinal cord

32:37.539 --> 32:39.207
severed somewhere back

32:37.539 --> 32:39.207
on the 95?

32:39.249 --> 32:42.502
And that we haven't eaten

32:39.249 --> 32:42.502
a full meal in over two months?

32:42.544 --> 32:45.380
- I thought we were broke.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.380
- See? See how it worked?

32:45.422 --> 32:47.215
And now we're reaping

32:45.422 --> 32:47.215
the rewards.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.593
Lane, we were starving.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.052
We scrimped on everything.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.345
I've stopped brushing my teeth

32:52.387 --> 32:53.764
because I couldn't

32:52.387 --> 32:53.764
buy toothpaste.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.933
I've been washing my hair

32:53.806 --> 32:55.933
with bar soap.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.393
But think about what

32:55.974 --> 32:58.393
we can do with the money.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.353
We can record.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.481
Make a CD.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.483
Nirvana made Bleach

33:02.522 --> 33:04.483
for $600.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.903
Even factoring in inflation,

33:04.524 --> 33:07.903
if we're on our game

33:07.945 --> 33:09.237
we could make Bleach

33:07.945 --> 33:09.237
ten times over.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.906
Our own Bleach.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.157
It would be very cool to record.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.827
- Very cool.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.827
- I think..

33:14.868 --> 33:17.245
Dude, come on.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.245
You gotta finish that sentence.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.332
- I can't talk and drive.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.332
- Then just drive, Gil.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.001
Thirty miles.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.001
Thirty miles to home.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.131
Are you talking about

33:26.421 --> 33:28.131
how pretty I am again?

33:28.173 --> 33:30.425
- Oh, get a new subject, boys.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.425
- What are you doing home?

33:30.467 --> 33:32.511
Well, I have to be at the inn

33:30.467 --> 33:32.511
late so I thought I'd come

33:32.552 --> 33:34.179
and feed Paul Anka,

33:32.552 --> 33:34.179
take him for a little walk

33:34.220 --> 33:35.639
work out our crosswalk issues.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.641
- Well, Tom here--

33:35.681 --> 33:37.641
- It's not my fault.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.100
I wasn't gonna say

33:37.683 --> 33:39.100
it was your fault.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.436
You've got it's-Tom's-fault

33:39.142 --> 33:41.436
tone in your voice.

33:41.478 --> 33:44.063
He-he's gotta shut your water

33:41.478 --> 33:44.063
off for a couple of days.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.565
We hit a pipe

33:44.105 --> 33:45.565
that shouldn't been hit.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.066
Tom!

33:47.108 --> 33:49.110
See how fast the

33:47.108 --> 33:49.110
it's-Tom's-fault tone has--

33:49.152 --> 33:50.779
- Yeah, you can stay with me.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.779
- Okay.

33:50.821 --> 33:51.989
Well, I gotta get back to work.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.281
That wedding party's

33:52.030 --> 33:53.281
coming in tonight.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.825
Oh, I'll gather up

33:53.323 --> 33:54.825
some of your stuff.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.493
The last time you gathered up

33:54.867 --> 33:56.493
some of my stuff

33:56.535 --> 33:58.203
you accidentally brought me

33:56.535 --> 33:58.203
four bras and no pants.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.496
That could have been

33:58.244 --> 33:59.496
intentional.

33:59.538 --> 34:03.000
I will get my own stuff,

33:59.538 --> 34:03.000
thank you.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.460
Ooh, now, I just have to figure

34:03.041 --> 34:05.460
out what to do with Paul Anka.

34:05.502 --> 34:08.296
You know, I've never left him

34:05.502 --> 34:08.296
alone so late before

34:08.338 --> 34:09.673
and he might start doing

34:08.338 --> 34:09.673
that howling thing

34:09.715 --> 34:11.508
the neighbors

34:09.715 --> 34:11.508
are so fond of

34:11.550 --> 34:13.844
but...well, that's okay.

34:13.886 --> 34:17.096
So, oh, you know, I guess

34:13.886 --> 34:17.096
I could just leave him here

34:17.138 --> 34:18.807
'and I can come back,

34:17.138 --> 34:18.807
and get him after work'

34:18.849 --> 34:21.267
which will be, uh, 2:00,

34:18.849 --> 34:21.267
3:00, 4:00 in the morning.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.062
Boy. Late.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.815
Or I could drop him off

34:24.103 --> 34:26.815
at a kennel for a few hours.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.985
I know there's a good one

34:26.857 --> 34:29.985
in Woodbridge, 20 miles away.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.487
Of course, I'd have to

34:30.027 --> 34:32.487
leave now and pick up some

34:32.529 --> 34:35.532
dilithium crystals on the way

34:32.529 --> 34:35.532
to fix the warp drive in my jeep

34:35.574 --> 34:38.451
so that I could drive there

34:35.574 --> 34:38.451
and back in time to meet

34:38.493 --> 34:42.288
the wedding party back

34:38.493 --> 34:42.288
at the inn, but that's doable.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.416
'Yeah, and then, of course,

34:42.330 --> 34:44.416
by the time I get off work'

34:44.457 --> 34:46.334
and drive all the way

34:44.457 --> 34:46.334
back there, the kennel

34:46.376 --> 34:48.712
will definitely be closed,

34:46.376 --> 34:48.712
so I'd have to break in

34:48.754 --> 34:50.630
and that would set off

34:48.754 --> 34:50.630
some kind of security system

34:50.672 --> 34:53.050
and then I'd be arrested, so I

34:50.672 --> 34:53.050
should probably put a nail file

34:53.091 --> 34:55.010
on my shoe, and how much longer

34:53.091 --> 34:55.010
are you gonna make me do this?

34:55.052 --> 34:56.720
I just wanted to see

34:55.052 --> 34:56.720
how long you'd go on.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.805
Well, you know my babbling

34:56.762 --> 34:58.805
capabilities are infinite.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.223
I'll take the dog home with me.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.392
And points for

35:00.265 --> 35:02.392
the dilithium crystal reference.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.270
Well, when you sleep

35:02.434 --> 35:05.270
with geeks..

35:05.311 --> 35:08.314
Hey, I just talked

35:05.311 --> 35:08.314
to my buddy, Tony Benzino

35:08.356 --> 35:10.149
who's a contractor

35:08.356 --> 35:10.149
over in Hartford

35:10.191 --> 35:13.862
and he says contractors don't

35:10.191 --> 35:13.862
fetch lunches for the crew.

35:13.904 --> 35:16.406
They do, however,

35:13.904 --> 35:16.406
get to answer the phone

35:16.448 --> 35:19.158
and they do get to sign

35:16.448 --> 35:19.158
for things, and order things.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.705
And, Tom, there is no such thing

35:19.200 --> 35:23.705
as a mystic hammer.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.959
And after this very

35:23.747 --> 35:26.959
enlightening conversation

35:27.000 --> 35:28.543
you know

35:27.000 --> 35:28.543
what I'm starting to think?

35:28.585 --> 35:29.878
What?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.504
I'm starting to think

35:29.920 --> 35:31.504
that I'm not

35:31.546 --> 35:34.257
really the contractor

35:31.546 --> 35:34.257
on this job.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.135
- Look, TJ--

35:34.299 --> 35:37.135
- It's okay, Luke. I got this.

35:37.176 --> 35:40.138
TJ, we did this

35:37.176 --> 35:40.138
for your own good.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.890
We got you out of the house.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.890
You got paid.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.101
You didn't get hurt.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.101
Look at it that way.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.479
Oh, yeah? Is that the way

35:44.142 --> 35:47.479
I'm supposed to look at it?

35:47.520 --> 35:53.068
Well, fine. You can keep your

35:47.520 --> 35:53.068
stupid, phony contracting job.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.278
I'm through playing your patsy.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.696
I'm through running

35:55.320 --> 35:56.696
your errands.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.239
Hold on. That's no mayo.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.783
Here, Ed.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.660
I'm done. I quit.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.413
You can all kiss

36:03.078 --> 36:05.413
any part of me

36:05.455 --> 36:08.416
that reaches

36:05.455 --> 36:08.416
your general vicinity first.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.877
You have seen the last of me.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.296
So<i> arrivederci, Roma!</i>

36:16.091 --> 36:18.051
And to repay you all

36:16.091 --> 36:18.051
for this lousy trick

36:18.093 --> 36:19.928
that you played on me,

36:18.093 --> 36:19.928
you can all reach in here

36:19.970 --> 36:21.721
and grab

36:19.970 --> 36:21.721
your own damn condiments.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.266
That's dinner!

36:27.644 --> 36:28.854
Hit me.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.772
That's your fourth

36:28.895 --> 36:30.772
milkshake, TJ.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.107
It doesn't matter, Luke.

36:32.149 --> 36:34.400
It's not like I got

36:32.149 --> 36:34.400
anywhere to go tomorrow.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.154
So, you're not a contractor.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.154
Who cares?

36:37.195 --> 36:39.156
Neither am I. You don't see me

36:37.195 --> 36:39.156
crying about it.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.574
I'm not crying about it...

36:39.197 --> 36:41.574
anymore.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.327
- It's not your thing.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.327
- Yeah, not my thing.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.080
I don't have a thing.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.080
I have nothing.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.665
You've got Liz.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.665
You've got your health.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.626
I've got no dream.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.626
I've got no future.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.963
What are you talking about?

36:51.668 --> 36:54.963
You got no future?

36:55.005 --> 36:57.090
Did you or did you not

36:55.005 --> 36:57.090
build these shelves?

36:57.132 --> 36:59.217
- I did.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.217
- Those are great shelves, TJ.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.635
- Stop it.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.635
- They are.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.512
There's real craftsmanship

37:00.677 --> 37:02.512
that went into those.

37:02.554 --> 37:06.307
Well made, you got

37:02.554 --> 37:06.307
some nice carved detail.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.394
That's a quality piece

37:06.349 --> 37:09.394
of merchandise and you made it.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.521
- Yeah, so?

37:09.435 --> 37:11.521
- You should be proud of that.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.939
Not everybody can do that.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.151
So you're not a contractor.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.151
You're a craftsman.

37:16.193 --> 37:19.487
Wow. I'm a craftsman.

37:16.193 --> 37:19.487
Like Jesus.

37:19.529 --> 37:20.947
He built stuff for a while.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.158
Yeah, you're exactly like Jesus.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.158
That was my point.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.869
Yeah. What am I

37:23.200 --> 37:25.869
getting so mopey about?

37:25.911 --> 37:28.496
I mean, I build shelves.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.708
I'm a craftsman

37:28.538 --> 37:31.708
who builds shelves like Jesus.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.335
And plus my day rate

37:31.750 --> 37:34.335
has just gone way up.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.088
Yeah, but, TJ,

37:34.377 --> 37:36.088
that was a contractor's rate

37:36.129 --> 37:37.756
you were being paid,

37:36.129 --> 37:37.756
not a shelf-maker's rate.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.591
Yeah, but I wasn't

37:37.797 --> 37:39.591
really the contractor.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.427
I know, but that was..

37:39.632 --> 37:42.427
Have a good night, TJ.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.937
Hey, just lying there.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.937
What a surprise.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.521
Make sure you grind

37:51.978 --> 37:53.521
that smelly butt of yours

37:53.563 --> 37:54.898
into the rug real good,

37:53.563 --> 37:54.898
get that aroma

37:54.940 --> 37:58.068
really locked

37:54.940 --> 37:58.068
in those fibers there.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.195
Oh, man.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.741
[sighs]

38:02.655 --> 38:04.741
Wow, you are fun to have around.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.918
Oh, no.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.169
Oh, crap.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.546
Oh, God.

38:18.588 --> 38:21.133
Tell me you didn't.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.634
There we go.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.011
[sniffing]

38:22.675 --> 38:25.011
Oh, jeez.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.973
[instrumental music]

38:35.688 --> 38:39.400
Come on. Hey, wake up.

38:35.688 --> 38:39.400
I got a dog out here.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.610
[panting]

38:42.821 --> 38:44.030
- Can I help you?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.030
- Yeah.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.240
The dog ate chocolate.

38:45.282 --> 38:46.783
And I don't know

38:45.282 --> 38:46.783
a lot about dogs

38:46.825 --> 38:48.618
but I do know

38:46.825 --> 38:48.618
they shouldn't eat chocolate.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.245
I went to the animal hospital,

38:48.660 --> 38:50.245
and they were closed.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.164
Then I called Babette,

38:50.287 --> 38:52.164
and she told me where you lived.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.540
And you gotta do something

38:52.205 --> 38:54.540
because this is not my dog.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.209
This is my fiancee's dog.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.209
She loves him.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.544
She named him Paul Anka

38:56.251 --> 38:58.544
which may on the surface

38:58.586 --> 39:00.713
not seem like a sign of love but

38:58.586 --> 39:00.713
if you knew her, you'd get it.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.590
Believe me, there's a lot

39:00.755 --> 39:02.590
of ways I could screw up this

39:02.632 --> 39:03.925
relationship,

39:02.632 --> 39:03.925
but I cannot lose her

39:03.967 --> 39:05.177
over the fact

39:03.967 --> 39:05.177
that I killed her dog.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.637
I'll get the ipecac.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.637
Come on in.

39:07.679 --> 39:12.267
So, I tell the guy, "Hey, there

39:07.679 --> 39:12.267
is no way all these potatoes

39:12.309 --> 39:16.354
could have been peeled if I had

39:12.309 --> 39:16.354
waltzed in here at 12:00."

39:16.395 --> 39:19.732
He simply refused to believe me

39:16.395 --> 39:19.732
or credit me with the hours

39:19.774 --> 39:22.527
so finally I just said,

39:19.774 --> 39:22.527
"You know what?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.946
"There is another soup kitchen

39:22.568 --> 39:24.946
down on Hadley

39:24.988 --> 39:26.823
"and they serve more vegetables

39:24.988 --> 39:26.823
than you do

39:26.865 --> 39:28.491
so I would rather work there

39:26.865 --> 39:28.491
anyhow."

39:28.533 --> 39:30.618
And I turned in my apron,

39:28.533 --> 39:30.618
and I walked out.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.079
Wow. Rough world, the world

39:30.660 --> 39:33.079
of community service.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.081
Oh, you don't know

39:33.121 --> 39:35.081
the half of it.

39:35.123 --> 39:39.085
I've done 125 hours,

39:35.123 --> 39:39.085
so I've got 175 to go

39:39.127 --> 39:42.255
which is a little off my goal,

39:39.127 --> 39:42.255
but not by much, so I can deal.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.632
I've got the candy striper thing

39:42.297 --> 39:44.632
starting next week.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.467
I didn't really want that,

39:44.674 --> 39:46.467
but I had to take it

39:46.509 --> 39:48.845
because I was supposed

39:46.509 --> 39:48.845
to get on the zoo beat

39:48.887 --> 39:50.429
which would have been gross

39:48.887 --> 39:50.429
but great

39:50.471 --> 39:51.890
'cause they'll let you

39:50.471 --> 39:51.890
do a double shift.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.641
But they're always full.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.268
- Weird, huh?

39:53.683 --> 39:55.268
- Very weird.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.936
- I'm boring you.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.936
- Far from it.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.856
I just have to go, I have to

39:56.978 --> 39:59.856
meet with my faculty advisor

39:59.898 --> 40:01.316
and convince her

39:59.898 --> 40:01.316
that this is the year

40:01.358 --> 40:02.901
I'm finally gonna make

40:01.358 --> 40:02.901
something of myself.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.861
Well, don't tell her about

40:02.942 --> 40:04.861
the cheese-rolling incident.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.321
She'll never believe you.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.488
You want a walk

40:06.363 --> 40:07.488
back to your car?

40:07.530 --> 40:09.490
No, I think I can make it

40:07.530 --> 40:09.490
by myself.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.244
- Okay.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.162
- I'll call you later?

40:12.285 --> 40:14.162
- Okay.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.750
[guitar music]

40:43.275 --> 40:46.194
- 'Hey.'

40:43.275 --> 40:46.194
- Hey. Sorry.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.029
I didn't mean to wake you.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.029
Go back to sleep.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.698
'No, it's okay.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.698
I like to watch you hydrate.'

40:50.740 --> 40:54.119
Oh, man. When did you get home?

40:50.740 --> 40:54.119
I didn't hear you come in.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.828
Yeah, you were conked out

40:54.160 --> 40:55.828
pretty good.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.414
- Oh, yeah.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.414
- Both of you.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.664
Yeah.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.417
How did it go with Paul Anka

40:58.706 --> 41:00.417
last night?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.877
Well, first off, he ate

41:00.458 --> 41:02.877
three pounds of unsweetened

41:02.919 --> 41:05.213
baking chocolate

41:02.919 --> 41:05.213
so I had to rush him to the vet.

41:05.255 --> 41:07.590
'To his house because

41:05.255 --> 41:07.590
the animal hospital was closed'

41:07.632 --> 41:10.385
and he forced some sort

41:07.632 --> 41:10.385
of vomit-inducing medicine

41:10.427 --> 41:13.930
down Paul Anka's throat,

41:10.427 --> 41:13.930
and then Paul Anka proceeded

41:13.972 --> 41:15.807
to throw up

41:13.972 --> 41:15.807
for the next hour and a half.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.184
'After that, I sat with him

41:15.848 --> 41:18.184
for another three hours'

41:18.226 --> 41:20.186
holding a bowl of water

41:18.226 --> 41:20.186
under his nose

41:20.228 --> 41:22.647
to make sure that

41:20.228 --> 41:22.647
he was rehydrating properly

41:22.688 --> 41:25.275
and then I chocolate-proofed

41:22.688 --> 41:25.275
the apartment and the diner

41:25.317 --> 41:27.193
'to make sure

41:25.317 --> 41:27.193
that never happens again.'

41:27.235 --> 41:29.070
'And now, I'm gonna

41:27.235 --> 41:29.070
go downstairs'

41:29.112 --> 41:31.406
and make Paul Anka

41:29.112 --> 41:31.406
some scrambled eggs

41:31.448 --> 41:33.366
because the vet said

41:31.448 --> 41:33.366
that the kibble is gonna be

41:33.408 --> 41:35.534
a little hard on his stomach

41:33.408 --> 41:35.534
for a couple of days.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.954
Does he have any...particular

41:35.576 --> 41:37.954
fear of cheddar?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.248
'Cause I thought I'd throw

41:37.996 --> 41:40.248
that in to make it taste better.

I don't wanna set

41:46.504 --> 41:47.839
a wedding date

41:47.880 --> 41:49.757
until things are right

41:47.880 --> 41:49.757
with Rory.

41:52.469 --> 41:53.761
Okay.

41:56.389 --> 41:59.184
- So, the cheddar is?

41:56.389 --> 41:59.184
- Okay.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.319
are cast in stone.

are your new best friends.

Become inseparable. You'll be

42:13.156 --> 42:16.075
asked for it constantly.
