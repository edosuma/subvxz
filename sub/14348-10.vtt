00:03.503 --> 00:06.256
Jeannie?
Hey, Jeannie!

00:06.291 --> 00:09.009
You burnt the toast.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.912
- You tryin' to run me over?
-Come on, lady!

00:13.413 --> 00:15.880
- Oh shit, Jeannie.
- What the hell are you doin' here?

00:15.915 --> 00:20.587
This is a public fare. You can
just go around me! Look, I'm sorry.

00:20.622 --> 00:22.422
You don't have to--
What's the matter with you?

00:22.457 --> 00:24.257
I need--
We need milk.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.594
But did you have to go out naked?
Did they give you a discount for that?

00:27.629 --> 00:29.394
Come on.
Get back inside.

00:29.429 --> 00:32.397
Hey, hey. Jesus. Screw
you. I told you I was sorry.

00:32.432 --> 00:37.937
- Can I get my pan back?
- Oh, shut up about your goddamn pan, you old whore!

00:37.972 --> 00:40.440
Mrs. Gervin, I'll get it back for
you. I promise you, I'll find it.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.276
- What did she say?
- You heard me.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.243
My brother's a married man!

00:45.278 --> 00:49.914
- Go throw yourself at somebody else, you slut!
- What?

00:49.949 --> 00:52.952
I'll get your precious, goddamn
pan! Mrs. Gervin, I'm sorry.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.919
But first,
I'll take a shit in it!

00:54.954 --> 00:57.457
Oh, Jesus, Jeannie! Oh, my.
Oh. I-I just wanted my pan.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.759
I never liked her.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.762
Come on inside. And her
cake, it tastes like shit.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.299
You know what she would have said
if she suddenly woke up one morning?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.301
What?
"My ass look fat in this bed?"

01:16.142 --> 01:18.978
Hey. How's it goin' with Janet?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.781
- It's goin' okay.
- Good.

01:22.816 --> 01:27.821
- How's it goin' with, uh--
- Like you give a shit. Debbie.

01:27.856 --> 01:29.823
Her name is Debbie.

01:30.323 --> 01:33.342
And when she licks my tits,

01:33.377 --> 01:36.354
she does it nice... and slow.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.297
Bye.

01:39.332 --> 01:42.335
Look at what
you're missing, Foxy.

01:45.672 --> 01:48.341
Tommy. Tommy!

01:56.683 --> 01:59.185
Hi. You all right? Yeah.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.688
Yeah?
How'd she do?

02:02.188 --> 02:06.693
Oh. She, uh-- She did great. She
fell asleep around 4:00 this morning.

02:06.728 --> 02:08.660
Good. Hi.
Hi.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.697
You want some breakfast?
Sure.

02:10.732 --> 02:12.532
Okay.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.275
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

02:24.310 --> 02:27.714
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

02:28.114 --> 02:30.849
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

02:30.884 --> 02:33.852
Things were good
when we were young

02:33.887 --> 02:37.223
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

02:37.258 --> 02:40.560
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

02:40.595 --> 02:44.028
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

02:44.063 --> 02:47.149
Things were good
when we were young

02:47.184 --> 02:50.201
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

02:50.236 --> 02:53.289
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

02:53.324 --> 02:56.342
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

02:56.609 --> 03:00.246
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

03:28.608 --> 03:31.075
Honey?
Yeah?

03:31.110 --> 03:34.179
- Breakfast is ready.
- Cool.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.616
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.618
It was great.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.787
I made your special eggs
with cheese. Oh, thanks, hon.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.289
You're welcome.
Thank you.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.758
So you wouldn't, uh--
What are you doin' today?

03:46.793 --> 03:49.260
Well, I still have to pick
up a few things for here.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.297
You know, I could use a couple
more pans, a bigger skillet.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.802
You wouldn't happen to be goin' by
the pharmacy at some point, would you?

03:56.302 --> 03:59.270
Why do you ask? Well, I got a
prescription I need to get filled,

03:59.305 --> 04:02.976
- and I just thought if you were goin' by
a drugstore-- - I am, as a matter of fact.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.277
- Today?
- Probably. I have something that needs to be refilled.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.749
Yeah, good. Good, 'cause you should,
you know, definitely get that refilled.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.485
A lot of people forget, you
know, and-- then they go in there,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.320
and it's not filled up, and,

04:14.687 --> 04:16.488
you know, healthwise,
it's a good thing.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.427
Just give it to me, and
I'll take care of it. Cool.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.430
What's your, uh, thing for,
by the way?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.767
- What, my prescription?
- Yeah.

04:29.002 --> 04:33.006
Uh, it's, like, a cold,
allergy thing. Eat.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.182
Everything okay?

04:43.683 --> 04:46.435
Oh, yeah.
Just another day in paradise.

04:46.470 --> 04:49.153
Your mother almost
burnt the house down,

04:49.188 --> 04:52.191
and then she felt it necessary
to go shoppin' in her skivvies.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.193
Where the hell
were you?

04:54.694 --> 04:58.162
Packing.
Packin'?

04:58.197 --> 05:02.702
You're leavin'? Dad, I told
ya. I gotta get back to Boston.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.305
You can't get any more time?
Ah, I called.

05:05.571 --> 05:09.042
My chief's a good guy. He's not that
good. I used up all my vacation time.

05:09.077 --> 05:12.378
What about sick leave?
Dad, I have to go.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.716
My life is there--
my job, Steven.

05:17.083 --> 05:21.654
So that's it-- I mean, you just walk
out, just like that? Like it's nothin'?

05:21.689 --> 05:26.225
Peter, I can't do this anymore. I can't
handle it anymore. I can't do anything.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.563
That little girl that I fell
in love with 35 years ago...

05:31.064 --> 05:35.068
is rottin' away on the inside, and I
just gotta stand by and watch it happen.

05:35.103 --> 05:38.202
I can't handle it
anymore, Pete.

05:38.237 --> 05:42.842
Don't worry.
You can handle anything.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.748
I love you, Pop,
and I'll be in touch.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.736
Bud,

06:11.771 --> 06:13.773
I had an accident.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.775
Oy.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.243
I-It's all right, sweetie.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.746
I'm sorry.
Okay. All right. Okay.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.748
No, no, no. It's okay. I
didn't mean to. Didn't want--

06:23.783 --> 06:26.285
Come on. Let's get you
cleaned up. Come on, sweetie.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.086
Come on.
It's all right.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.922
So the anticipation
is killing me.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.793
Uh, what do you mean?
For my next poem.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.094
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.631
Why do you need another one?
The first one was so good.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.968
Oh, it really, really was. Thanks.

06:42.003 --> 06:44.804
But the second one
sort of sucked,

06:45.037 --> 06:49.909
so now I have this tiny,
nagging doubt, you know?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.377
I mean, the two poems were
so different from each other,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.879
I'm startin' to wonder if maybe
you just wrote the second one.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.817
Or maybe I wrote 'em both, and the
first one took so much out of me,

06:57.852 --> 06:59.784
I didn't have anything
left for the second one.

06:59.819 --> 07:03.322
You know, I don't really care what
happened. I just wanna know the truth--

07:03.357 --> 07:06.826
which kinda seems to be a chronic
problem between us, Franco.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.329
Did you write the poems?

07:10.830 --> 07:15.168
They started here. They went
through here. And they came out here.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.342
Then write me another one.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.514
Why not man?
Because, okay,

07:29.015 --> 07:32.518
you have to be in a certain frame of
mind to write that poetry stuff, okay?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.537
I mean, you-- It's--
It's a mood thing.

07:34.572 --> 07:36.487
A mood thing? Yeah. It's a mood thing.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.525
All right. You seemed like you were
in a good mood the last couple of days.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.360
Well, I'm in a pretty
shitty mood right now, okay?

07:41.861 --> 07:43.362
You want me to write you
some shitty-mood poetry?

07:43.863 --> 07:46.866
"Life sucks, blah, blah, blah, by the way,
so do your tits." Is that what you want? No.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.868
Just, you know, forget about
her tits, but maybe you could--

07:49.368 --> 07:52.336
you could write somethin' about
her hair, you know? Please.

07:52.371 --> 07:55.624
All right. All right. I'll try.
Okay? Hey, that's all I'm askin' man.

07:55.659 --> 07:58.843
All right. If it could happen by the
end of the shift, that'd be great.

07:58.878 --> 08:02.215
Y-You're kiddin' me, right? I mean, you
think Carl Sandburg came up with the whole...

08:02.250 --> 08:06.184
"fog rollin' in under cat's claw"
thing under this kind of pressure?

08:06.219 --> 08:11.224
- Is that what you think? Huh?
- I don't know what you're talkin' about, Tom.

08:11.259 --> 08:13.559
Never mind.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.564
Hey, Tommy. You bring any of that
fancy coffee today-- Don't touch me.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.566
brother? What's wrong with you, huh?

08:21.067 --> 08:25.571
What am I, your goddamn maid? Get
your own goddamn fancy coffee, asshole.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.577
So how do I go about this? I don't know.
There must be a service or something.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.597
I mean, why don't you look in the phone
book? How much you think it'll cost?

08:34.631 --> 08:37.582
Probably pretty steep. It's not gonna
be cheap, but you don't need a live-in.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.549
What are you talkin' about?
None of your business.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.385
Chief's got a little problem he's tryin'
to work out. Yeah? Maybe I can help.

08:42.421 --> 08:45.925
Yeah, and I can grow a vagina. You know what?
They're doing that, like, somewhere in Asia.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.893
They're actually cloning body
parts. It's called "cloning."

08:48.928 --> 08:51.896
It's weird huh? You want a
vagina? You got one. Yeah.

08:51.931 --> 08:56.035
So what seems to be the problem?
Uh, this is gonna be a waste of time,

08:56.070 --> 08:58.037
but, uh, I need a nurse.

08:58.337 --> 09:01.106
Oh yeah? I happen to know
somethin' about nurses.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.841
I hired one a couple of
months back. Oh, really?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.946
Oh, yeah, for Bald Paul's, uh,
bachelor party. God, it was so funny.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.913
She was really cute too.
She had this slammin' body.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.618
- Garrity, I don't need a stripper. I need
a nurse. - No, no. She's-- She's a nurse.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.954
She's, like, the real deal. She's
got a uniform, hat, the whole nine.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.255
If he doesn't shut up, he's
gonna need a goddamn nurse.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.625
No, no. She's a stripper and a
nurse, though-- I promise. She--

09:19.859 --> 09:21.894
She works at a hospital
downtown. Stripper and a nurse?

09:22.194 --> 09:25.414
That doesn't do me any good. I need somebody
to keep an eye on my wife durin' the day.

09:25.449 --> 09:28.634
I mean, I can give her a call-- she gave me
her number-- and see if she knows anybody.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.768
Maybe she can help.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.556
All right.
Give her a call.

09:33.591 --> 09:36.309
All right.
You got it, huh?

09:37.643 --> 09:40.711
- Jesus Christ.
- What's the matter?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.983
- I'm goin' to Garrity for help.
- Yeah, but you know, look at it this way:

09:44.018 --> 09:47.253
At least things can't get any
worse. Ready? Penny a point.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.489
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me. You pickin' me up, or am I meetin' you there?

09:50.524 --> 09:52.456
Meeting me where?

09:52.491 --> 09:56.495
Yo, Tommy, you'd probably forget your dick
if it wasn't scotch-taped to your balls.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.729
The blood drive, Father
Murphy's rectory. Remember?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.966
- Ah, shit.
- We told him that we'd both show up, so you gotta come.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.837
- I'll meet you there.
- Might wanna pick up someone else's blood on the way.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.773
- Yours is probably still flammable.
- Yeah, yeah. Asshole.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.511
How was work today?
Slow, actually. No fires.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.479
We had, uh, two stuck
elevators, car accident.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.649
Days like today, you know, I feel a
little guilty about takin' the money.

10:18.684 --> 10:23.522
Although they only pay us $4.50 an hour,
so, you know, how guilty can you get?

10:23.557 --> 10:25.990
God, Ken, you're so funny.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.492
I really like being with
you. You make me laugh.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.329
Well, some value in that I
suppose. You have no idea.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.700
In my line of work, I meet a lot of men,
but never the complete package like you.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.470
Can we not discuss my package
on an empty stomach?

10:37.505 --> 10:40.171
Shall we peruse the menu?

10:40.206 --> 10:43.209
Shit, that's my work ring.
Do you mind? Work is work.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.009
Hey, babe. Hi. You free at 10:00?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.844
10:00? Yeah, I'll be free. Your place?

10:46.879 --> 10:51.384
My place. Bring a friend? Yeah, I
can bring a friend along. Of course.

10:51.419 --> 10:53.386
You sure you can afford us both?
Sure, I can.

10:53.886 --> 10:58.391
All right. Okay, I'll call
her now. See you then, sweetie.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.060
I'm sorry. I need to make
another call. No problem.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.027
Hello?

11:03.062 --> 11:05.398
Naomi, it's me. Hey, you
wanna do a double tonight?

11:05.798 --> 11:09.235
You mean that guy? Nice enough guy, great
loft down in Tribeca, should be easy.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.071
He just wants to jack off
while we go down on each other.

11:12.304 --> 11:15.873
Sorry. Wrong tube.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.410
I'll text you directions later. Great.

11:17.445 --> 11:19.710
Okay, bye.
Bye.

11:19.745 --> 11:23.481
Was that terrible? I'm
sorry. Y-You know, I--

11:23.516 --> 11:28.020
I-- I consider myself worldly in
an unworldly kind of way, and--

11:28.521 --> 11:32.024
Is there another way for you to make money for
school? Whatever happened to waiting tables?

11:32.525 --> 11:36.560
- Nothing pays as well, and my pimp wouldn't be too happy.
- Can I talk to him?

11:36.595 --> 11:40.866
I'll be honest. I've talked to him about
quitting. But he says I'm one of his best girls.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.868
There's no way.
We have an arrangement.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.404
- Has he ever hurt you?
- No. No. F-Bomb is great.

11:46.439 --> 11:50.376
F-Bomb, of course. F-Bomb. Listen.
If I was to talk to this F-Bomb,

11:50.876 --> 11:52.910
- try to convince him to
let you out-- - Kenny--

11:52.945 --> 11:57.415
If I could convince him to
let you out, would you quit?

11:57.450 --> 12:01.120
- Yeah. Yeah, I would.
- Then give me a number. Give me an address.

12:01.155 --> 12:04.790
They're not people you can negotiate
with. He'd kill me, literally.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.628
What about if I was to pay him, kind
of like buyin' out your contract?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.431
I couldn't.
Ask him.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.734
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

12:14.769 --> 12:17.303
You're so sweet.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.140
I'm thinkin' about
the meat loaf.

12:22.141 --> 12:24.108
Seriously, Tommy,
trust me on that.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.111
One or two cookies
usually will do the trick.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.613
I just feel really light-headed. You
don't have any more juice, do you?

12:29.648 --> 12:33.152
You almost fainted gettin' off the
table, you pussy. I got up too fast, okay?

12:33.652 --> 12:36.489
You should watch your language in front
of the house of God. Back me up on that?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.223
- He's right. -
Sorry. - Yeah, asshole.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.392
- You wanna get some coffee?
- I, uh-- I'd love to,

12:41.427 --> 12:44.263
but I gotta clean things up here,
and, uh, then I gotta get Ricky home.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.266
He seems like a good kid, that
Ricky. He is. He's a great kid.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.270
Listen. I gotta run, and thanks for donating,
and would you go easy on the cookies?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.774
Okay. Fine. Thanks. Huh.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.277
You know, I like that guy, but he's
startin' to creep me out just a little bit.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.280
You know, you and Mickey, man--
All you do is judge people.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.283
You know? He's fine. Hey, you know
what? You give that guy a bad nose job,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.285
a ranch with some rides on it,

13:06.786 --> 13:09.288
and Liz Taylor's home number, you're
lookin' at Michael Jackson, my friend.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.255
Okay. First of all
he's our half brother, okay?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.758
If he's Michael Jackson, you
know what that makes us? What?

13:13.793 --> 13:17.797
That makes me Tito, and that makes you
Jermaine. Why do I gotta be Jermaine?

13:17.832 --> 13:20.233
'Cause I'm Tito.

13:20.268 --> 13:22.635
Yo, what's he doin'?

13:22.935 --> 13:24.935
Huh? That kid over
there-- What's he doin'?

13:24.970 --> 13:27.973
You know, I've seen that kid. He's been
here the last couple of times I was here.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.476
Hey, what are you doin'?
Hey! Hey, what's up?

13:30.511 --> 13:32.843
Oh, shit.
Oh, now he's runnin'.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.881
Slow down.
Tommy, what are you doin'?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.217
Hang on. God.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.888
- Hey, you! Move along!
- Watch out for that traffic.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.890
Now, hold on!

13:46.892 --> 13:51.397
Get your hands off me, man. Settle down!
Settle down. I'm a cop. Settle down.

13:51.432 --> 13:53.364
Settle down.
Come on.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.200
Tommy, what are you doin'?
A little light-headed again.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.904
- Who's that?
- That's my brother. He's a pussy. It's all right.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.073
Take it easy. Take it
easy. You know this kid?

14:01.307 --> 14:04.009
- Like I said, I saw him a couple of times.
- What's wrong, man?

14:04.276 --> 14:05.976
- What are you doin'?
- None of your business.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.298
I'll take you to Father Murphy.
We'll see whose business it is.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.585
What? He's tellin' you he's gonna
take you to see Father Murphy.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.521
You do that. Yeah, I'd love
to see the look on his face.

14:15.556 --> 14:17.756
- What do you mean?
- He sees me, he'll--

14:18.257 --> 14:20.259
he'll shit himself
all the way up to his collar.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.261
What are you
talkin' about?

14:23.262 --> 14:25.229
I'm Ricky's
older brother.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.700
- Yeah. - A'ight? And I'm
watchin' that shit-face asshole...

14:28.200 --> 14:32.538
because I know he's-- he's molestin'
Ricky the same way he molested me.

14:33.772 --> 14:37.276
He started when I was 13.
Lasted almost three years.

14:37.509 --> 14:42.548
When my mother told me that-- that Ricky was
spending a lot of time with Father Murphy, I--

14:42.583 --> 14:45.349
I don't know.
I blame myself.

14:45.384 --> 14:49.455
I should've said somethin'. Now
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.133
What are you doing?

15:01.634 --> 15:05.471
Ah, nothin'. I was just, um, checkin'
to see if your mom had some pills.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.306
- Pills?
- What?

15:07.806 --> 15:10.809
Pills. Uh-- No, bills. I
said "bills." Like money.

15:10.844 --> 15:13.777
Oh. Don't be a smart-ass.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.447
Are you takin' a poetry class? English.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.485
The teacher is this weird little
gay guy who smells like bacon.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.754
He loves poetry, so we
have to learn a new poem...

15:21.789 --> 15:23.989
every week and recite it
like a bunch of dweebs.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.456
He smells like bacon? Yeah.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.791
Um, so this is, like,
romantic poetry, right?

15:27.826 --> 15:31.163
Yeah, there are tons of them. They're
all stupid though. You've seen 'em all.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.166
Are there any ones about,
like, uh, women's hair?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.467
I don't know.

15:36.502 --> 15:39.338
Could you go through, see if you
could find a poem that was either...

15:39.373 --> 15:41.305
specifically about how
pretty a girl's hair is...

15:41.340 --> 15:45.344
or has some parts that is about hair for me,
and just write it down-- copy it down for me?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.680
- Why?
- It's a surprise thing for your mother. Shh.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.682
-Morning.
- Hey. Hey.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.149
Hi. Good morning baby. What's goin' on?

15:52.184 --> 15:54.652
Mom, Dad's makin' me
copy a poem. Oh, God.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.190
Do you know what? It is nice to see you
taking an interest in your children's homework.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.693
- I know.
It's not--

16:01.694 --> 16:03.994
Never mind.
My life blows.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.264
Yeah. Watch your language, please.

16:07.299 --> 16:11.036
Hey, you hungry, babe? I'm gonna have, uh,
somethin' to eat with Mick on the way in.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.540
Hey, did you happen to, um, get
my prescription filled for me?

16:14.575 --> 16:16.774
No. You forgot
to give it to me.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.511
- So y-you didn't go to
the drugstore then? - No.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.132
It's no big deal. Just give it
to me, and I'll take care of it.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.683
Yeah, yeah. I'll just have my
doctor call it in, and then...

16:25.718 --> 16:29.221
- you can pick it up when you go to pick up, uh, your stuff.
- Okay.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.223
- Great.
- Hey, what is it?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.691
My thing? Uh, it's--

16:33.726 --> 16:35.693
it's like Advil,
only, you know, bigger.

16:35.728 --> 16:39.697
So, why don't you just take,
like, a big handful of Advil?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.067
You know, it's nothing like Advil.
I don't know why I said that.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.802
It's the same color. That's
why I said that. That's why.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.073
- All right. So you'll, um--
you'll-- You won't forget? - No.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.576
Okay. I love you. Bye. Love you.

16:50.611 --> 16:52.845
Bye.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.581
So what do we do?

16:56.081 --> 16:58.083
Well, there's not much
we can do, Tom.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.855
Come on. We got a priest who's had two
relationships with 13-year-old boys...

17:02.890 --> 17:05.124
over the course of
three, four, five years.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.027
There's gotta be somethin' we can
do. Yeah. We got your scumbag brother.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.079
Half-brother. Your half-cousin.
He'll deny every word of it.

17:11.115 --> 17:14.098
Listen. As much as I would
like to nail this bastard...

17:14.599 --> 17:17.501
and run his ass out of the church straight
into Rikers, we don't have anything.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.939
Well, what do you want me to get? Polaroids?
Home movies? Here's me in the Grand Canyon.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.376
Here's me down in the Bahamas, and
here's me bangin' the 13-year-old.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.546
Maybe the kid's got somethin'.
He didn't mention anything.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.581
Oh, you asked him?
I'll ask him.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.917
Physical proof of the
relationship-- that's what we need.

17:33.952 --> 17:37.723
Otherwise, we'd have to catch him
in the act with his little brother.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.959
Oh, God.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.029
All of a sudden, I'm not hungry.
Yeah. Likewise.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.800
Well, why not? I've already stuck my
little poetic dick out for you once...

17:48.300 --> 17:51.268
and got it chopped off in the process.
And that was a great, goddamn poem.

17:51.303 --> 17:54.807
You tell your little girlfriend I said
so. She doesn't know shit about free verse.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.310
Lou, look. You gotta help me out
here, okay? I got nowhere else to go.

17:58.345 --> 18:01.313
She's up my ass lookin' for this
thing, and I got zip from Tommy.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.281
He left me twistin'
in the wind as usual.

18:04.316 --> 18:08.320
Please, Lou? You're the only
real poet I know. Please?

18:08.355 --> 18:10.788
Well, you know--

18:10.823 --> 18:14.326
since you asked nice, what kind
of thing we lookin' for?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.830
Hey, hey. Here's your poem,
man. Sorry it took so long.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.834
That fresh coffee? Looks kinda
old. Can you make a new, uh, pot?

18:21.869 --> 18:23.801
I'll put on a new pot for
you. Great. I'll be right back.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.339
Oh, Tommy, you rock, man.
This is great.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.807
All right. Thanks
anyway. Yeah, yeah. Great.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.679
In the words of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning, "Blow me."

18:33.912 --> 18:37.449
Who leaves a space heater on in the middle
of goddamn summer? It's gotta be a broad.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.818
Ninety-five degrees out, they're still
feelin' a breeze. It's an oxygen thing.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.857
They spend so much of their day talking about
shoe sales and how their mothers are screwed up--

18:45.090 --> 18:48.092
"Can you believe that shop
in Paris didn't let Oprah in?"

18:48.127 --> 18:51.697
There's no air left inside. It creates
a vacuum. The next thing you know, boom.

18:51.732 --> 18:54.700
July in Christmas.
Christmas in July. Love it.

18:54.735 --> 18:57.000
- Yeah.
- It's Mariel.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.873
Hey, how you doin'? Hey, I--
I got the blood test done.

19:00.908 --> 19:04.174
I'm sorry? The D.N.A.--
It's not the same.

19:04.209 --> 19:08.213
Oh. Well, yeah. Listen,
Mariel-- So, um, you wanna...

19:08.248 --> 19:10.447
grab dinner and a
couple of drinks tonight?

19:10.482 --> 19:14.853
Look, um, Mariel. I'm, uh--
I'm actually back with my wife.

19:14.888 --> 19:19.224
I mean, it's not, uh-- you know,
it's not absolutely perfect,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.560
but I'm tryin' to make it work,
you know what I mean?

19:22.060 --> 19:24.628
- So, can you--
- Gotcha.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.965
Um--
bad timing, I guess.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.236
I hate to put it
this way, but, uh,

19:31.603 --> 19:36.074
if things kinda go south,
give me a buzz.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.910
Bye.

19:42.414 --> 19:45.215
Dr. Feinberg's office.

19:45.250 --> 19:49.755
Yeah. Hey, this is, um, Jimmy Keefe
callin'-- Sheila Keefe's husband.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.090
Is the-- Is the doc in?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.391
Yes.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.929
- Jimmy Keefe is on the phone.
Put him on.

19:56.964 --> 19:58.729
- Doc?
- Mr. Keefe.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.534
I need a prescription for this drug. It
actually was prescribed by an F.D.N.Y. doc.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.437
I just haven't been able to get down
there, pick it up yet from headquarters.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.941
So I was wondering if you could do me for
it? Called Selectra. It's basically harmless.

20:09.441 --> 20:12.277
Should be available over the counter,
as far as I'm concerned, and...

20:12.778 --> 20:15.245
I was just wonderin'
if you could-- Hello?

20:15.280 --> 20:19.551
- My research has proven to me two things.
- About the drugs?

20:19.586 --> 20:22.352
About you.
You are not Jimmy Keefe.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.123
Jimmy Keefe gave his life in the
tragedy of 9/11. Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:25.158 --> 20:27.125
Let me explain, all
right? Number two--

20:27.160 --> 20:29.461
Yeah?
Whoever you are,

20:29.695 --> 20:32.196
you need far, far more
than Selectra...

20:32.231 --> 20:36.568
to cure your many deeply
seated problems, my friend.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.870
Di-i-ick.
Ah!

20:39.905 --> 20:42.773
So what's the deal with this? Well,
y-you call up, and you tell 'em...

20:42.808 --> 20:47.312
what kind of service you want, what kind of
hours you need, and they send a bunch of nurses.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.815
I only need one. I know, but
that's, like, the fun of it.

20:49.850 --> 20:51.782
They send over a bunch,
and you choose one.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.320
It's likeAmerican Idol, you know,
except it's nurses instead of singers,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.423
and you don't get to call up
and vote to see who wins,

20:57.458 --> 20:59.491
and Paula Abdul's not there
acting like a freak show.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.327
Actually, it's not likeAmerican
Idol, but it's really good.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.162
Just give me the number.
It's back at the house.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.064
I'll get it. She said, you call
today, and they'd send people tonight.

21:07.099 --> 21:12.004
Good. Hey, Garrity, I-- I never thought
I'd actually hear myself saying this, but...

21:12.039 --> 21:13.839
thanks.
No problem, Chief.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.341
I got it.

21:20.112 --> 21:24.850
This is amazing. It's-- It's
even better than the first one.

21:24.885 --> 21:27.317
Well, what can I say baby?
You inspire me.

21:27.352 --> 21:32.357
I-- I-- I can't believe
you wrote this. I know.

21:32.858 --> 21:36.326
No. No. I-- I--
I really can't.

21:36.361 --> 21:39.865
I'm suspicious now. What
are you talkin' about, baby?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.832
Laura--
Laura, I told you.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.370
They start here. They go
through here-- Yeah, yeah--

21:45.405 --> 21:48.874
Heart-head-mouth thing.
That was amazing the first time.

21:48.909 --> 21:51.341
Now something's
just not adding up.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.879
Look. You said the second poem
sucked and you wanted a third-- Yeah.

21:54.379 --> 21:58.050
That was a test...
that ya failed, Franco.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.285
You know, hugs aren't
the answer right now.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.058
So you move in for the kiss if it's
not a hug? What's next-- a tit grab?

22:07.059 --> 22:09.026
Oh, my God!

22:09.061 --> 22:11.063
Laura, I--

22:11.563 --> 22:15.567
I-I was not-- I was not
gonna grab your breasts, okay?

22:17.903 --> 22:19.536
This poem is yours.
Not me.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.908
Ah, come on, Lou. You can tell me. I sure
as shit know that Franco didn't write it.

22:22.943 --> 22:25.928
How? Well, I really love
the guy, but he's not a poet.

22:25.963 --> 22:28.879
He wrote a shopping list
the other day-- three things.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.417
Took him a half an hour, and he
spelled "peanut butter" with four "T's."

22:32.452 --> 22:34.885
There's three of them.
Yeah, but come on.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.340
Anybody can make that mistake-- Okay,
he spelled "Coke" with a capital "K."

22:38.375 --> 22:41.760
Well, point taken. And I really wanted
to believe he was writing this stuff,

22:41.795 --> 22:44.728
but now I know it was just you
doing him a favor. Wasn't me.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.099
Well, if it wasn't you, then who was
it? Look. I'm not at liberty to say,

22:47.134 --> 22:49.101
but you're within your
rights to keep asking.

22:49.136 --> 22:51.902
Sean?

22:51.937 --> 22:54.738
The probie?

22:54.773 --> 22:57.525
Not Gavin?

22:57.560 --> 23:00.278
Tommy Gavin?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.950
Hey, I was just callin' to check
in-- see how everything's goin'.

23:04.985 --> 23:08.752
Oh, Tommy, that is so sweet.
Hey, how's it going there?

23:08.787 --> 23:12.391
Just had one call this morning, an electrical
thing. We knocked it down in 15 minutes.

23:12.426 --> 23:15.627
So, you-- you, uh, runnin' around?
Yes, and I'm getting a lot done.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.630
You didn't happen to, uh, get to
the, uh, drugstore yet, did you?

23:18.665 --> 23:21.098
I'm heading that way. Did you
call in for your prescription?

23:21.133 --> 23:24.469
I was just about to call
my doctor and call that, uh--

23:24.970 --> 23:27.437
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

23:27.472 --> 23:30.141
Yeah. It's me. I need you to come over.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.776
Oh, shit. Tommy? Hello.

23:32.811 --> 23:36.148
What? I--
I'm not coming over.

23:36.381 --> 23:37.881
- She hit me.
- Who?

23:37.916 --> 23:42.421
Debbie. She punched me in the
face. I now have a black eye.

23:42.456 --> 23:44.388
All right. So why you
callin' me, all right?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.926
Call the goddamn cops. She sets you on
fire, then you can call me, all right?

23:47.961 --> 23:49.292
Hang on.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.663
No. No, because she
might be coming back soon.

23:51.698 --> 23:54.499
Janet? Is... Tommy Gavin there?

23:54.733 --> 23:58.135
-You're talkin' to him. Who's this?
-Kevin Vasquez. Ricky's brother.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.673
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How you
doin'? How you doin'? The answer's yes.

24:01.708 --> 24:05.277
- What do you mean?
- I have something: proof.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.512
A letter he sent me, tellin'
me he couldn't see me anymore,

24:08.013 --> 24:10.515
and warning me about not to tell
anyone about what happened between us.

24:11.016 --> 24:13.483
- He signed it?
- Yes, sir.

24:13.518 --> 24:17.189
You wanna nail this guy and get him shit-canned,
all right, take care of him for good?

24:17.224 --> 24:19.858
- My brother's a cop, all right?
- I remember.

24:20.225 --> 24:23.195
You call him. He'll run the info through
the system, and we'll take this guy down.

24:24.696 --> 24:27.164
- I don't know.
- What about your little brother, huh?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.667
You wanna protect him or not?
I'll-- I'll think about it.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.705
Goddamn it. I have another
call comin'. Hang on.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.173
Hello!
I'm still here!

24:36.208 --> 24:40.177
Hold on.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.179
Yeah!
Hey, I lost you.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.716
Goddamn cell phones,
Honey. Hang on. Hang on.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.184
I, um-- I just called
the prescription in,

24:47.219 --> 24:50.305
so whenever you wanna work your
way over there would be great. Okay.

24:50.340 --> 24:53.117
- Is there some rush? - Well, I--
I guess I'm like a lot of people.

24:53.152 --> 24:55.894
- I just-- you know, I like
really... fresh medicine.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.195
What?
I gotta go.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.697
I-I love you. I gotta go. Bye.

25:00.732 --> 25:05.035
- Bye. Kid, you there?
- I'm here.

25:05.070 --> 25:09.341
- Christ.
- Tommy, please, please, please, please come over.

25:09.376 --> 25:11.808
I don't want to be here
by myself when she comes home.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.246
I swear to God, I will never ask
you for anything ever again.

25:14.746 --> 25:17.481
Please. Please, please, please?
All right. I'll come over. Okay?

25:17.516 --> 25:22.087
But, so help me God, you better have a black
eye, or otherwise I'm bringin' one with me, okay?

25:22.122 --> 25:25.590
All right. Bye.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.759
You wrote this?

25:29.261 --> 25:32.229
No. No.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.267
Don't deny it.
Lou told me everything.

25:37.536 --> 25:42.506
Lou didn't... tell you anything.
Nice bluff though.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.111
Hey. We were just talkin' about
you. Did you talk to Laura...

25:46.611 --> 25:49.079
about the poem
that Franco wrote for her?

25:49.114 --> 25:51.616
- No. she asked me some questions.
- And what-- what did you say?

25:51.983 --> 25:55.220
Oh, I didn't say anything.
No. It was all kinda subtext.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.258
O-Okay.

26:01.293 --> 26:07.465
I-- I wrote... the first poem
and the last one. The middle one--

26:07.500 --> 26:09.467
The one that sucked? Yes.
That was-- That was Lou.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.435
I was just doing a friend
a favor, okay?

26:12.470 --> 26:16.641
- Sure you weren't doin' yourself a favor?
- What do you mean?

26:18.476 --> 26:21.479
- You're makin' a move on me.
No!

26:21.980 --> 26:23.481
You don't write...

26:23.982 --> 26:27.986
beautiful, gorgeous poetry like
this 'cause you're helpin' out a pal.

26:28.021 --> 26:32.455
Okay. First of all, I happen
to be back in love with my wife.

26:32.490 --> 26:36.494
I don't know if you've heard the talk
around here, but we're back together.

26:36.529 --> 26:39.982
- You write your wife poetry like this?
- No.

26:40.017 --> 26:43.400
Yes. Kind of. It's
complicated. Complicated how?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.888
Well, it's complicated, because
I'm-- I'm taking these pills now...

26:46.923 --> 26:50.342
for something else, but I ended
up writing poetry while I was--

26:50.377 --> 26:52.809
So they're, like, poetry
pills? They're not poetry pills.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.847
They're-- it's-- but I wrote--
I wrote a couple of things on it.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.316
About me.
No.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.854
I mean, yes, in, you know--
in a roundabout way,

27:02.889 --> 27:05.155
but not, uh, what you think.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.792
Why don't you just admit
that you have feelings for me?

27:07.827 --> 27:11.529
I don't have... feelings
for you. Not like that.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.865
But you're attracted to me?

27:14.366 --> 27:19.371
Well, truthfully, I'm-- You're a
very attractive girl. You're very hot.

27:19.406 --> 27:23.041
- You have a great ass, but you
have one of those-- - Hey, guys.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.547
- What's goin' on?
- Ask your pal.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.019
Yeah, pal. What's goin' on?
Uh, I was eatin' some ice cream.

27:36.054 --> 27:41.059
I had one of those Biggy Iggy... things. It
was stuck to my lips, and Laura was just--

27:41.094 --> 27:43.561
I gotta call somebody. Um--

27:51.670 --> 27:55.240
Oh, thank you for coming.
It means a lot to me.

27:55.275 --> 27:57.926
Let's see the eye.

27:57.961 --> 28:00.543
Oh, shit.
I know.

28:00.578 --> 28:03.380
Where did ya meet this
broad-- a holding cell?

28:03.415 --> 28:07.217
Everything was fine. We were
like two peas in a pod, right?

28:07.252 --> 28:11.423
And then she totally loses it, and she
starts talkin' about how annoying I am,

28:11.790 --> 28:15.725
and how needy I am, and how I
always make everything about me,

28:15.760 --> 28:20.765
and that I'm a drama queen, and
the list just goes on and on and on.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.767
Yeah. Hard to imagine.

28:25.270 --> 28:28.606
Let me ask you something. Will you
just stay here for a little while,

28:29.107 --> 28:31.675
in case she comes back-- because
I think I might need moral support.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.779
Not to mention a whip and a chair. I'm not
gonna get in the middle of this whole thing.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.532
No, no, no. You won't. You
won't. Just sit down. Okay.

28:37.567 --> 28:39.784
Just stay for a little bit
and sit down. All right.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.420
Um, you want a whiskey?

28:43.455 --> 28:46.725
- And, uh, soda? You want a club soda.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.561
Fine.
Okay. I'll get it. Okay.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.595
Kathy, thank you so much for
comin' over at such short notice.

28:52.630 --> 28:57.402
You have a-- an extensive and an impressive
r?sum?. Yeah, I like helping people.

28:57.437 --> 29:01.290
A lot of nursing. I like helping
people and opening their eyes...

29:01.325 --> 29:05.143
and their ears to the glorious
word of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

29:05.178 --> 29:09.581
Uh, Es-- Exper--
Ex-- Es-per-an-za.

29:10.582 --> 29:14.586
Ins-- Es-- What?
Es-- Esp-- Esperanza.

29:14.621 --> 29:18.590
- I like skin.
- I really, really, really,

29:18.625 --> 29:20.592
need the cash.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.096
Thanks a lot for comin' by.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.098
Thanks.

29:40.578 --> 29:42.579
So,

29:42.614 --> 29:44.481
you're back with Janet?

29:44.516 --> 29:47.685
Yeah. Yeah.
It's goin' great.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.587
That's good.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.624
How's it goin' with--
Um, that's right.

29:52.659 --> 29:54.626
She punched you in the face. Yeah.

29:54.661 --> 29:56.127
Not goin' good?
No.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.129
No.
Honey, I'm home.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.633
Oh, does she lead with
her left or her right?

30:01.668 --> 30:03.635
Right.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.038
What's up?

30:07.539 --> 30:10.708
We, uh--
We should talk outside.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.958
Okay. I did not do that to
her. Okay, you know what?

30:28.993 --> 30:32.063
Bullshit. What are you talking about?
She hit herself? I did not do that to her.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.399
That's what you're tellin' me.
She banged her head on a closet--

30:34.799 --> 30:36.835
on purpose, if you ask
me-- to get you here.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.571
You know what? I love her, but
she still has a thing for you.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.206
- Really?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.743
I know she got involved
with me on a rebound basis,

30:46.144 --> 30:47.679
and I-- I didn't
care, because...

30:48.179 --> 30:51.015
I thought that she was starting to
feel the way I feel about her, and--

30:51.316 --> 30:55.885
But, oh, my God, every other
story was, "Tommy and me,"

30:55.920 --> 31:00.758
and, "Tommy used to say"-- and Tommy
this, Tommy that, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.611
Wow.

31:03.646 --> 31:06.062
Well,

31:06.097 --> 31:09.065
I guess that...
makes sense then. What--

31:09.100 --> 31:12.103
It's crazy, but-- Yeah.
You see what I'm sayin'?

31:12.138 --> 31:14.439
Yeah. Yeah.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.442
Yeah.
It's just--

31:17.477 --> 31:19.409
Still--
It's crazy.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.697
Oh, thanks.
She's--

31:22.732 --> 31:25.950
She is just... so hot.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.704
And--
Yeah, she--

31:29.739 --> 31:31.956
She is.
Oh, thanks.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.460
And her skin
is so chocolaty, man.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.464
Yeah. Those nipples--
How great are those?

31:44.969 --> 31:46.971
Yeah. They--

31:52.477 --> 31:54.979
Hey, uh, um,

31:55.014 --> 31:56.946
listen.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.484
The other night,
when I was goin' down on her,

31:59.884 --> 32:04.322
she was tryin' to tell me about
this special thing that you do,

32:04.822 --> 32:08.326
and I didn't want to hear any more "Tommy"
bullshit, so I ran downstairs, started pouting.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.828
But, um,

32:11.829 --> 32:15.383
I was wondering
if I could ask you--

32:15.418 --> 32:18.937
- About the thing.
- Yeah.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.940
Oh.

32:21.975 --> 32:23.942
Yeah.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.445
Hey, you better get a pen.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.316
Hello?

32:33.351 --> 32:35.151
Hello.
Ah, I'm sorry.

32:35.186 --> 32:38.655
Hi. Uh-uh-uh, come in.
Come in.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.659
Are you, um, Hazel
Haynes from the Bronx?

32:42.694 --> 32:48.032
No. I'm Rose Atwell. I just moved
in next door. I brought you a pie.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.168
Wow.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.205
Good luck.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.841
He gave me a list.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.712
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tommy. It's me.

33:01.212 --> 33:03.179
Come on.
Look, uh, the kid called.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.050
We ran the signature on the letter.
It matches our half-brother's.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.988
Mickey and me, right now, we're down
outside the church. The kid's on his way.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.056
You wanna join us?
Yeah.

33:13.391 --> 33:16.894
Perfect end
to a perfect day.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.302
How's this
gonna go down?

33:26.337 --> 33:30.306
Shouldn't be too complicated. We sit
the jerk down. We show him what we got.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.794
We tell him he'd better make a new career
choice or else. Creepy bein' in here at night.

33:33.829 --> 33:37.248
Tell me about it. The last time I was in a
place like this at night, I was makin' out...

33:37.283 --> 33:39.048
with Patty Jenkins,
back in high school.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.919
You know what? Me too, in the
church. Patty Jenkins? Really?

33:41.954 --> 33:44.387
Mm-hmm. You? Ah, what a slut.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.389
Three for three. Yeah,
but she was a holy one.

33:46.424 --> 33:49.093
I wonder where she is now. Probably
back in that confessional booth...

33:49.594 --> 33:52.030
where I left her, with her
skirt hiked up over her head.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.899
Wait a minute. You banged
her in the confessional? Yeah.

33:54.934 --> 33:57.333
That's--

33:57.368 --> 33:59.870
You know, I'm disgusted
by the two of youse.

33:59.905 --> 34:02.373
- Can I help you?
- Hey, Father, it's just us.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.378
Oh. Well I hope you're not
all here for confession.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.344
I'll have to call
for some backup.

34:09.380 --> 34:13.884
No, you won't. We're not the ones
who are gonna be doin' the confessing.

34:13.918 --> 34:18.389
So what does that mean?
- You wanna tell us about Ricky?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.358
What about him?
He's a great kid.

34:22.393 --> 34:26.397
Yeah. We're sure he is-- or he was
before you put your hands on him.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.900
- What are you insinuating?
- What do you think I'm insinuating?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.904
I don't know. That's why I'm asking
you. Tom, you wanna help me out here?

34:33.404 --> 34:35.406
Well, did you
put your hands on him?

34:37.408 --> 34:40.911
That is a pretty disgusting remark to
make, especially in a house of worship.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.414
Gimme a break.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.918
Not all priests engage
in that kind of behavior.

34:48.418 --> 34:51.454
In fact, some of us
can keep it in our pants.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.492
So you're sayin', you're not
involved with this kid, right? No.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.495
- So you never touched him?
- No.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.501
Say it.
We need to hear it, Murph.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.504
I have never touched Ricky.

35:08.506 --> 35:11.509
What about
his older brother?

35:15.513 --> 35:18.015
Can we talk
someplace else?

35:19.350 --> 35:22.787
You know, when I heard
from the Feeneys about--

35:22.822 --> 35:25.056
about what was going on
with your wife--

35:25.091 --> 35:28.091
Hmm.
I just thought, um--

35:28.126 --> 35:30.828
based on what I went through
with my late husband--

35:30.863 --> 35:33.663
that, you know, that we--
we should talk.

35:33.698 --> 35:39.470
- Yeah. Thanks. Uh, it's good to talk.
- Yeah.

35:40.705 --> 35:44.475
- How long did your guy last?
- Um, five years.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.777
- Um, he didn't know me.
- Hmm.

35:47.812 --> 35:52.517
He thought I was 25 years
younger. Wishful thinking.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.953
Bud? Bud!

35:56.988 --> 35:59.490
Oh, I'll be right there.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.493
- She thinks I'm her
brother Bud-- - Oh.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.897
who she's always loved, no matter
what the hell kinda crap he pulled.

36:05.932 --> 36:08.750
- Wishful.
- Wishful. Yeah.

36:08.785 --> 36:11.569
Anyway, you go. I'll clean up.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.537
Hey, uh, thanks.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.639
You're welcome.
Thanks.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.845
Kevin was a troubled kid. He
was one of the altar boys here.

36:21.746 --> 36:24.213
He developed a fixation on me.

36:24.248 --> 36:27.685
I-- I was flattered at first.
He didn't have a role model.

36:28.186 --> 36:32.690
His dad was long gone, but it got unhealthy
very quickly-- from his side, not mine.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.260
I told him we couldn't
interact on any level.

36:38.095 --> 36:41.432
Hey, I figured I would put in for
a transfer, just to... be safe.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.668
I don't know. Maybe he saw
the error of his ways,

36:43.703 --> 36:46.037
but he took off before
I ever put in any paperwork.

36:46.072 --> 36:48.372
So there was nothing sexual
between the two of you.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.374
Nothing.

36:54.278 --> 36:56.280
This tells
a different story.

37:03.788 --> 37:06.490
I don't see any mention of
a sexual relationship here.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.193
I think a jury'll see that
a little bit differently.

37:11.062 --> 37:15.031
- I think you guys should leave.
- Uh-uh. Not until you explain--

37:15.066 --> 37:19.070
What is the big deal, huh-- like he was the
only kid who was ever abused? Give me a break.

37:19.105 --> 37:22.073
You wanna know somethin'?
Can I tell you somethin'?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.479
I was abused by a priest.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.446
Yeah.

37:30.481 --> 37:33.417
I was abused. And you know what? At first
I thought, "Well, isn't this horrible,"

37:33.452 --> 37:35.820
and I wanted to kill myself.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.324
And I thought it was just the worst thing
ever, but you know, then I realized somethin'.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.727
I liked it.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.963
Aw, geez.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.335
Yeah, I liked it.
Made me feel special.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.770
I mean, think about it.
Here's this man--

37:54.805 --> 37:59.210
God's holy messenger on Earth-- and
he wanted to lay his hands on me.

38:01.512 --> 38:05.016
There was somethin'
beautiful about that.

38:05.051 --> 38:07.952
You got nothin' here.

38:10.454 --> 38:14.458
I don't think it's nothin'. Kevin.

38:19.463 --> 38:23.034
Be honest, Father.
It's a lot more than nothing.

38:25.202 --> 38:27.872
- What are you doin' here?
- What the hell do you think I'm doin' here, huh?

38:28.873 --> 38:31.774
C-Could I talk to him alone?
Do you mind?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.677
- Hey! Quit pointin'--
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:33.712 --> 38:35.546
Whoa, Kevin. Whoa, Kevin. Hey. Hey. Hey.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.013
Come on.
Come on.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.051
- Kev.
- Kevin, put the gun down. Come on.

38:40.086 --> 38:41.951
- Admit what you did.
- Kevin.

38:41.986 --> 38:46.490
-Just relax. Take it easy, okay?
-You want to be alone with me, huh?

38:46.525 --> 38:49.894
- Admit what you did!
- I know what I did.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.164
I can live with that.
Oh, yeah?

38:53.199 --> 38:55.364
Well, live with this.

38:55.399 --> 38:57.633
Oh, no!

38:57.668 --> 39:01.238
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.579
Oh, my God.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.088
Go call somebody.
Hey!

39:30.267 --> 39:32.234
Get up,
you son of a bitch.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.438
You piece of shit!
Son of a bitch!

39:37.608 --> 39:41.112
God.

40:08.739 --> 40:14.245
I sing it one last time
for you

40:15.746 --> 40:20.751
Then we really have to go

40:21.252 --> 40:26.257
You've been the only thing
that's right

40:28.259 --> 40:31.262
In all I've done

40:34.765 --> 40:40.271
And I can barely look at you

40:41.272 --> 40:46.277
But every single time I do

40:47.778 --> 40:51.782
I know we'll make it
anywhere

40:53.784 --> 40:56.787
Away from here

41:02.193 --> 41:05.696
Light up
Light up

41:06.197 --> 41:10.701
As if you have a choice

41:10.736 --> 41:15.206
Even if you cannot hear

41:15.706 --> 41:17.440
My voice

41:17.475 --> 41:22.146
I'll be right
beside you, dear

41:28.152 --> 41:31.620
Louder, louder

41:31.655 --> 41:36.494
And we'll run for our lives ?

41:36.529 --> 41:38.996
I can hardly speak

41:39.263 --> 41:42.698
I understand

41:42.733 --> 41:48.072
Why you can't raise
your voice to say

41:53.511 --> 41:57.480
Slower, slower

41:57.515 --> 42:02.485
We don't have time for that ?

42:02.520 --> 42:08.275
All I want's to find
an easier way

42:08.310 --> 42:14.031
To get out
of our little heads

42:19.436 --> 42:22.905
Have heart, my dear

42:22.940 --> 42:27.945
We're bound to be afraid

42:27.980 --> 42:31.382
Even if it's just

42:31.417 --> 42:34.750
For a few days

42:34.785 --> 42:39.290
Makin' up for all this mess ?

42:44.962 --> 42:48.397
Light up
Light up

42:48.432 --> 42:53.904
As if you have a choice

42:54.371 --> 42:57.308
Even if you cannot hear

43:46.557 --> 43:47.858
Cloudland.
