Pre vious/y on
Cond or. . .

00:04.090 --> 00:07.105
[Bob]
Joel; in the wind.
E ve/yone else is dead.

00:07.210 --> 00:08.939
[Bob on phone]
I recruited Sara/7 Tan.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.076
I also removed any reference
to your relations/lie.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.273
For everyone in that oﬁ‘ice,
it’s just another job,

00:14.380 --> 00:16.553
but you're personally
interested in the truth.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.275
Joe Turner is Me a son to me,

00:18.380 --> 00:20.632
and there’s no doubt in mind
that he o’idn ’t do those things.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.924
-How long ago did you breakup
with what's-her-face?
-Who's "what's-her-face"?

00:23.030 --> 00:25.487
-Janice, the girl you're still
bent out of shape over.
-Six years ago.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.569
Finding Joe a girl.
She's perfect for you.

00:27.670 --> 00:29.729
-And you're matched.
-To Kathy H.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.618
Mad is what I get when
someone shows up
45 minutes late to a date.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.654
I have to feed
my neighbor's cat.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.739
If you let me use your laptop,
I promise I will feed
the neighbor's cat.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.695
I know it's asking a lot
for you to step aside
and let Marty Frost

00:40.800 --> 00:43.428
handle this investigation.

00:43.530 --> 00:46.624
-Bob?
{Bob on phone]
Get out now.

00:46.730 --> 00:48.539
We gotta-- [grunts] God!

00:48.650 --> 00:52.063
Hey, don't move!
Need a clearance check on
a ﬁrst name "Gabrielle"...

00:52.170 --> 00:54.172
-[Joubert] Joubert.
-[agent on radio]
Conﬁrmed

00:56.020 --> 00:59.808
[theme music playing]

01:23.280 --> 01:25.271
[both grunt]

01:28.410 --> 01:30.401
[exhales]

01:30.810 --> 01:32.801
Fuck!

01:33.410 --> 01:35.480
[grunting]

01:36.900 --> 01:38.970
[panﬁng]

01:52.350 --> 01:54.341

02:36.870 --> 02:38.872
Oh, shit!

03:19.550 --> 03:20.892
[Joe grunts]

03:21.000 --> 03:23.468
[sirens wailing]

03:24.760 --> 03:26.751
[Joe] Fuck.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.771
Oh, God.

03:58.190 --> 04:00.306
-[cat meows]
-[gasps] Oh!

04:01.670 --> 04:03.809
Jesus.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.911
At least now we can feed you.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.356
[overlapping chatter]

04:14.210 --> 04:15.859
Yeah, everything,
any and all red flags.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.779
I don't care how minor,
broken windows, stolen cars...

04:17.890 --> 04:19.300
I've been holding
for 10 minutes, okay?

04:19.410 --> 04:20.980
Listen, I need check points
at Cleveland...

04:21.090 --> 04:23.832
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
I know what I need to do...

04:23.940 --> 04:26.272
-I got my guy...
-[Marty on phone]
All right;
Boyd tell me what you have.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.075
Well, there are
signs of a struggle.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.469
There's also two breakfast
settings in the kitchen.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.207
So, maybe it started out
friendly, you know.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.608
-Hey,coﬁee?
-Keudg.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.484
Sorry about that.

04:38.590 --> 04:39.989
You're still here, Boyd?
Don't you have to check-in
with Satan's wife?

04:40.070 --> 04:41.799
[agents laughing]

04:41.910 --> 04:43.081
Ah, fuck!

04:43.190 --> 04:45.010
Do you have confirmation
that Turner was there?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.417
[Boyd]
How are we doing
on those pr/nts?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.215
[agent 1] Did he park
somewhere else?

04:48.320 --> 04:49.230
[agent 2]
Just give me a call back
at this number, okay?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.129
[agent 3] Uh, let's check.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.935
[Boyd] We have confirmation.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.746
That means we just missed him.

04:54.850 --> 04:56.420
[Boyd on phone]
50, we ’re doing
our door-to-doors.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.906
A lot of people are at work
this time of the day,

04:58.010 --> 04:59.625
but we got visuals
on every single house.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.721
We have a judge on call,
in case we need to move fast.

05:02.290 --> 05:03.382
Ma'am...

05:03.490 --> 05:05.833
Why are we assuming that
we just missed him?

05:05.940 --> 05:08.829
Because why would Turner go out
in broad daylight?

05:08.940 --> 05:10.931
Is there food in the fridge?

05:11.660 --> 05:13.514
Yeah, tons.
It's pretty stocked.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.839
So, every law enforcement
agency in the city
is looking for you,

05:16.950 --> 05:18.884
you are hiding in a house

05:18.990 --> 05:21.527
that is owned by a single woman
with no roommate,

05:21.630 --> 05:23.848
and you have food,
why would you leave?

05:23.950 --> 05:26.532
Well, he probably figured
we'd find his Tinder profile
sooner or later, right?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.255
No, then, why would you
go there in the first place?

05:28.360 --> 05:31.329
Panic, didn't think it through?
Had to go someplace.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.692
If I were Joe Turner,
this house would be

05:33.800 --> 05:36.098
one of the safer places
that I could go,

05:36.200 --> 05:41.149
considering that my face
is plastered across every
single television in America.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.184
The only reason
that I would lea ye,

05:43.290 --> 05:46.418
is because I was sure
that It was no longer safe.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.669
You think someone
tipped hIm off
we were coming?

05:48.780 --> 05:50.771
VVho?

05:51.140 --> 05:52.710
Does Hale have a car?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.698
[sighs] DMV doesn't have active
registration in her name, no.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.122
So he's close.

05:59.230 --> 06:00.925
I want you to find him.

06:01.030 --> 06:02.884
You got it.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.764
Let’s keep it between us
that someone may have
warned Turner.

06:04.870 --> 06:07.896
That person may turn out
closer than we think.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.991
Yes, ma'am.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.294
Was that the boss on the phone?

06:12.400 --> 06:14.539
-Yeah.
-What does she want?

06:14.640 --> 06:15.971
Just micro-managing.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.059
Hey, make sure they check
every door and window,

06:18.160 --> 06:20.708
look for little scratches
on the locks.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.347
-Why, do you think he's close?
-Yeah.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.441
[Sharla]
What makes you think that?

06:26.490 --> 06:28.481
Instinct.

06:28.810 --> 06:31.119
He must have
pretty good Instincts.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.915
He's a step ahead of everybody.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.237
Yeah, maybe.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.989
Maybe he had help.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.091
Really?

06:38.620 --> 06:40.042
Who from?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.141
Never mind.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.821
[Boyd sighs]

06:47.550 --> 06:49.541
[indistinct chattering
on radio]

06:53.840 --> 06:55.091
[chuckles]

06:55.200 --> 06:57.771
I though you were married.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.940
-Just checking out
the late entry.
-Uh-huh.

07:01.050 --> 07:04.668
So, what do your instincts
tell you about her?

07:04.770 --> 07:08.558
Maybe CIA, there's a lot of
independent contractors.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.076
CIA on American soil?

07:11.180 --> 07:13.171
[police chatter over radio]

07:14.060 --> 07:15.789

in distance]

08:43.300 --> 08:45.302
[muffled yelling]

08:54.270 --> 08:56.272
[Joubert] Hello, you.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.151
All alone?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.871
Bye-bye, kitty.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.332
[cat meows]

09:25.780 --> 09:27.782
[thud]

09:29.430 --> 09:32.922
-[Kathy groaning]
-Shh! Shh! Shh!

09:33.030 --> 09:35.021
-[Kathy coughs]
-Shh! Shh!

09:36.470 --> 09:38.131
Let me explain
something to you.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.129
The woman who rang the doorbell
is not here to help you.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.174
She tried to kill me.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.010
And the fact that she's out
there, means that she's with
the government.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.248
Which means she's probably
in the fucking CIA, okay?

09:51.450 --> 09:53.304
Don't worry, I sound crazy
to me, too.

09:53.410 --> 09:55.401
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.294
I'm sorry.
This may sting a bit.

10:14.070 --> 10:16.061
It's okay, it's okay.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.312
-[Kathy whimpers]
-I'm sorry.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.671
I'm sorry.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.031
I'm not crazy.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.321
Okay? I'm not crazy.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.401
And I'm not violent.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.961
Please.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.190
You got me good.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.473
You know that?
[chuckles]

10:46.580 --> 10:49.151
All that shit about how
you would have liked me...

10:49.260 --> 10:51.262
I guess I look pretty stupid.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.329
How can I not feel
close to you?

10:55.430 --> 10:58.729
You're the only person
I've ever told what I
really do for a living.

10:58.830 --> 11:00.821
[chuckles]

11:01.440 --> 11:03.374
But I, I guess
it doesn't mean much

11:03.480 --> 11:05.471
to be intimate with
a captive audience.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.882
[sighs]

11:14.370 --> 11:16.361
You know what, Kathy?

11:19.210 --> 11:22.270
I'm gonna tell you some stuff
that I have never told anyone.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.871
And I'm not gonna do that
to persuade you or anything
like that.

11:24.980 --> 11:26.993
I'm gonna do it because
that way if I die,

11:27.100 --> 11:30.319
someone will know the truth.
Someone will know
what really happened.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.980
[suspenseful music playing]

11:44.560 --> 11:48.917
[Joe]
I was recruited Into
the CIA during my last year
at graduate school.

12:01.890 --> 12:03.892
[exhales]

12:13.740 --> 12:15.742
[Janice] Good morning.

12:20.470 --> 12:23.325
-We have to get on the road.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:23.430 --> 12:25.409
[chuckles]

12:25.520 --> 12:26.930
Okay, okay, how much time
do we have?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.213
We have lots
and lots and lots of time.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.778
Are you saying that because
we actually have lots and lots
and lots of time?

12:32.880 --> 12:34.973
-[Joe chuckles]
-Or 'cause you wanna get laid?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.183
Mmm. We'll be fine.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.268
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.382
You're not answering
my question.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.481
I do not remember the question.

12:41.530 --> 12:43.225
I'm serious.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.753
I don't wanna _make
a bad first Impressmn, okay?

12:45.860 --> 12:47.851
Hey.

12:49.020 --> 12:51.011
It's impossible.

12:51.740 --> 12:54.436
-[Janice gasps]
-They're gonna love you.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.326
-[Joe groans]
-Everybody loves you.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.000
We're kind of in the middle
of something, Caleb.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.364
Eh, it wasn't working anyway.
I have to get ready.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.721
Ready for what?

13:02.830 --> 13:04.400
We've spoken about
eavesdropping, Caleb.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.172
-Eavesdropping is the great
American pastime.
-[Joe chuckles]

13:07.280 --> 13:10.329
-What do you think?
-Not that kind of gay.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.328
Listening to people
when they don't know
you're listening

13:12.440 --> 13:14.579
is the only way you can really
know who anyone is

13:14.680 --> 13:16.739
in the Facebook-fucked frenzy
we call existence.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.707
You know, just 'cause
the sentence has a certain
alliteratlve quality,

13:19.810 --> 13:21.220
doesn't make it true,
you know that, right?

13:21.330 --> 13:23.867
-Yes, it does.
-[Janice] How about this one?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.780
I will not be reduced
to a stereotype.
The floral print.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.869
People today are like
little baby birds,

13:28.980 --> 13:31.517
being fed tiny predigested
bits of information.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.430
And the stuff _that_
goes down eaSIest IS
whatever sounds best,

13:34.540 --> 13:37.475
like the terrorists
wanting us dead
because they hate our freedoms.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.047
I gotta have a shower.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.243
-You want some company?
-Are you going somewhere?

13:41.350 --> 13:43.124
[Janice]
What gave you that idea?

13:43.230 --> 13:45.289
No, no, I need you two
here today. We're hacking
the school's server

13:45.390 --> 13:47.483
and releasing
the faculty payroll. I got
all of Bannon's passwords.

13:47.590 --> 13:49.694
[Janice]
It's Thanksgiving, Caleb.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.415
So, we can't hack
the university server

13:51.520 --> 13:53.818
and expose gender
and race-based pay gaps,

13:53.920 --> 13:57.333
'cause you guys are celebrating
the time a bunch of sadistic
Europeans came to America,

13:57.440 --> 14:00.466
took advantage of
and murdered the gentle
indigenous peoples

14:00.570 --> 14:01.901
that had been living here
for centuries,

14:02.010 --> 14:03.989
and then were like,
"Look what we discovered"?

14:04.090 --> 14:06.923
-Wait, isn't that more
Columbus Day?
-[Janice laughs]

14:12.340 --> 14:17.437
[man on radio]
Jeremiah 29:11,
”For I know the plans I have
for you ” declares the Lord

14:17.540 --> 14:22.000
’p/ans for welfare
and not for ewl to give you
a future and a hope. ”

14:22.110 --> 14:23.759
Why is it whenever
you drive long distance,

14:23.870 --> 14:26.247
God is the only thing
you can ever find on the radio?

14:26.350 --> 14:29.205
[man on radio]
Thats just
another way of talking about
finding God’s plan for you.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.528
[whispers softly]
God has a plan for me.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.971
-[chuckles] Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.412
I hope it doesn't interfere
with my plan for you.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.408
You have a plan for me?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.562
It's just a fantasy,
that's all.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.865
-So, tell me your fantasy.
-[chuckles]

14:47.970 --> 14:49.983
We'd move into the house
in Berkeley,

14:50.090 --> 14:52.354
take teaching jobs,
if we wanted to.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.394
You could use my dad's
old office to work on

14:54.500 --> 14:57.515
whatever brilliant idea
you're gonna change
the world with.

14:57.620 --> 15:01.010
-Yeah?
-And my old room
will be for the baby.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.742
I like your plan.

15:04.590 --> 15:06.080
-Yes.
-You know, my, uh, my dad

15:06.190 --> 15:09.000
thought he could change
the world and raise a family.

15:09.110 --> 15:13.979
And he didn't live to be much
older than I am right now,
and he didn't change anything.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.992
-You're not your father, Joe.
-No, I, I know. Just...

15:20.520 --> 15:22.374
You never talk about him.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.549
His name is Edmond, right?

15:23.650 --> 15:26.210
Uh, yeah, yeah.
People called him "Ned."

15:27.650 --> 15:29.538
How did he and your mom meet?

15:29.650 --> 15:33.234
Oh, he, he was a mathematics
professor and my mom
was one of the students.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.035
-What?
-Uh, yeah.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.394
So, I was unplanned.
They got married.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.799
And then, just before
I was born, he was offered
a job to be the president

15:41.900 --> 15:43.720
of the American University
in Beirut.

15:43.830 --> 15:45.980
-[Janice] You lived in Beirut?
-[Joe] I was born there.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.404
Okay.

15:48.510 --> 15:51.809
My dad believed that
America had fractured
the Middle East.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.538
And that Americans had a duty

15:54.640 --> 15:58.110
to be there, to, you know,
to, to fix it.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.529
-Wow.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.414
He was shot in his classroom.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.865
-They never caught anyone.
-Why was he killed?

16:07.970 --> 16:11.542
He was, uh, he was
the most prominent
American target

16:11.650 --> 16:13.902
that they could get
ahold of at the time.

16:14.010 --> 16:16.478
You know, I...
Me and my mom were
living in the States

16:16.580 --> 16:18.309
when he died.

16:18.420 --> 16:21.230
I didn't really get
to know him, he's just
an idea that I have

16:21.340 --> 16:25.276
from photos and various things
my mom and Bob
told me about him.

16:25.380 --> 16:26.529
Was Bob also a professor?

16:26.630 --> 16:28.564
Bob? No, no, no, no, no.
He's crazy.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.719
He... He was a diplomat
who spent his career in
various embassies

16:31.830 --> 16:33.764
throughout
the Middle East, uh...

16:33.870 --> 16:36.930
And I guess, he and my dad
traveled in similar circles,
they became close,

16:37.040 --> 16:41.318
and then_ Bob married
my dad's Sister, Aunt LIly.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.031
So...

16:47.290 --> 16:49.281
[Janice] You never told me
your uncle was rich.

16:52.810 --> 16:54.266
[car stops]

16:54.370 --> 16:56.361
[unbuckling seat belts]

17:05.380 --> 17:07.371
[Bob sighs]

17:09.550 --> 17:11.984
There's something I've been
meaning to give you.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.201
[exhales]

17:38.090 --> 17:40.911
Why do you have
an old handgun. Uncle Bob?

17:41.020 --> 17:44.330
I've worked for the CIA
since 1973.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.171
[chuckles]

17:54.270 --> 17:55.441
You're serious.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.541
[chuckles]

17:58.710 --> 18:00.712
So, why are you telling me now?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.071
You're trying to recruit me?

18:11.650 --> 18:13.538
No.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.026
No.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.461
Why?

18:16.570 --> 18:20.870
I am against everything
the CIA has ever stood for.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.039
That's because you're young.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.495
And you still believe that

18:26.860 --> 18:29.909
the world can be changed
by ideas alone.

18:30.020 --> 18:33.683
But people like
your girlfriend,

18:33.790 --> 18:36.361
with her little acts
of disruption,

18:36.470 --> 18:38.449
what they don't understand

18:38.550 --> 18:42.714
is that without real power,
you cannot make a dent
in this world.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.631
Have you been spying on Janice?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.409
I didn't need to.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.511
FBI was already doing that.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.626
What the fuck, Bob?

18:57.730 --> 19:01.143
You know,
the biggest single threat

19:01.250 --> 19:03.639
we face as a country today...

19:03.740 --> 19:05.628
Uh, an intelligence apparatus

19:05.740 --> 19:07.799
that, uh, spies
on some citizens

19:07.900 --> 19:11.711
that has no surveillian
over5ight, that wages secret
wars all around the world?

19:11.820 --> 19:15.119
No, it's that the best minds
of the last few generations

19:15.230 --> 19:18.324
have sold out to Wall Street
and Silicon Valley.

19:18.430 --> 19:22.082
And a lot of other people left
to fight the secret wars which,

19:22.190 --> 19:24.772
believe me, needs to be fought,

19:24.880 --> 19:29.715
are mediocrities, psychopaths,
or some combination of the two.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.871
It's time for bright,

19:34.730 --> 19:36.721
decent people

19:37.410 --> 19:39.401
to take over.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.891
[Joe] I don't want your gun.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.531
I didn't say
it was my gun, Joe.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.846
My father?

19:57.950 --> 19:59.724
That's right.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.206
All those years?

20:01.310 --> 20:03.665
-Beirut?
-That was a cover, Joe.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.871
[Janice] Dinner!

20:11.680 --> 20:12.578
[Janice] You okay?

20:12.680 --> 20:13.851
Huh?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.019
-I asked "Are you okay?"
-Yeah.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.939
-Ye_ah?
-Fine.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.189
So, these students convince
the clean to pull
the Thanksgiving meal

20:20.290 --> 20:22.542
from the cafeteria for the kids
that weren't going home
for the break,

20:22.650 --> 20:25.460
because they said Thanksgiving
was a celebration of genocide.

20:25.570 --> 20:27.754
Yeah. I wonder
where they got that idea.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.034
-Like, probably history books
or something, huh?
-[chuckles]

20:31.140 --> 20:32.789
[man]
It was 400 years ago, I mean,

20:32.900 --> 20:36.518
do you realize how comfortable
a society has to have become

20:36.620 --> 20:39.123
to have the disposable energy
to complain about
a national holiday?

20:39.230 --> 20:42.609
And this is why all our friends
stopped coming
to our holiday dinners.

20:42.710 --> 20:45.167
Can we please talk about
something other than politics?

20:45.270 --> 20:49.570
Have you given any thought,
Joe, as to what you might do
after school?

20:49.680 --> 20:51.671
[chuckles]

20:52.960 --> 20:56.817
Well, on the car ride
over here, Joe was talking
about becoming a professor.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.502
-Like his dad.
-I haven't
really decided anything.

20:59.610 --> 21:01.225
[Lily]
Oh, that would
be wonderful, dear.

21:01.330 --> 21:02.900
[man] Don't sell
yourself short, Joe.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.103
Teaching is selling
himself short?

21:05.210 --> 21:07.189
[man] Of course it is.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.838
Free market determines
the value of work, and we all
know around this table

21:09.940 --> 21:11.350
that Joe can do better.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.997
[Janice] I don't think
Joe should sell himself at all.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.877
Our society puts too much
emphasis on money
and individual achievement,

21:17.980 --> 21:19.959
and not enough on character,

21:20.070 --> 21:22.846
and the ramifications
of the choices that we make
on the world around us.

21:22.950 --> 21:24.599
I like her.

21:24.710 --> 21:28.589
I was just extolling
the virtues of public service
to Joe.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.771
[man] Society can't benefit
from people like Joe
pushing government papers.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.826
All right? The economy thrives
when its best people

21:39.930 --> 21:41.784
go out into the private sector
and create jobs.

21:41.890 --> 21:43.824
I totally disagree with you.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.989
Please pass the salt.

21:46.090 --> 21:48.900
The system
isn't perfect, but...

21:49.010 --> 21:51.877
It's better than
no system at all.

21:51.980 --> 21:55.472
It's easy to say for someone
who doesn't suffer
under the current system.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.310
Suffering has been a constant
throughout history.

21:58.420 --> 22:01.969
_The modern world
didn't invent poverty,
racism or warfare,

22:02.070 --> 22:03.799
-but it could end them.
-[Janice] Really?

22:03.910 --> 22:06.322
Which modern world
would that be?
I'd like to visit it.

22:06.430 --> 22:10.605
You don't visit it,
you make it,
you fix it from inside.

22:10.710 --> 22:13.690
Even if it's only in small
incremental ways.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.893
[Janice] People don't
change systems.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.936
Systems slowly eat away at them
until the person inside
disappears, and they just

22:20.040 --> 22:22.144
do what the chair
they Sit in tells them to do.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.899
And then they find themselves
doing things

22:24.010 --> 22:25.898
that the human they used to be
would've found despicable.

22:26.010 --> 22:29.389
You can't trust yourself to sit
in a chair because
you're worried about

22:29.490 --> 22:32.459
what the chair
might make you do.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.091
Maybe you're the problem.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.781
[man]
Hello?

22:45.150 --> 22:47.141
Anybody here?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.515
[suspenseful music]

23:20.060 --> 23:22.051
Ah, there you are.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.982
[chuckles]

23:29.990 --> 23:31.981
Hey. I'm here.

23:33.230 --> 23:36.131
Yeah, he's here.
I found him in your bedroom.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.049
Guess he misses you.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.253
Yeah, where do you keep
your cat food?

23:40.360 --> 23:45.787
Look, I just wanna feed the cat
and get out of here
as soon as possible, okay?

23:45.890 --> 23:49.542
'Cause there is a serial killer
_ on the loose
in your neighborhood?

23:49.650 --> 23:51.538
No, no, this guy has already
killed 12 people,

23:51.650 --> 23:54.608
he probably killed Kathy
and I don't want to be
his next victim.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.875
[man clears throat] Okay, okay.

23:57.980 --> 24:01.336
I'll play with
the little fucker
for a few minutes.

24:03.980 --> 24:06.084
So, what were you thinking?

24:06.190 --> 24:08.181
You want some num-nums?

24:08.910 --> 24:10.901
I'll get your num-nums.

24:11.870 --> 24:13.861
Let's find some num-nums.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.359
[Joe] I'm gonna trust you
not to scream.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.511
[Bob] I'm sorry, Marty.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.090
Bob?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.373
I'm sorry.

25:08.480 --> 25:11.165
[crying] You hurt me
so much, Bob.

25:13.850 --> 25:16.068
Let me make it up to you.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.161
Can you tell me
that you love me?

25:18.930 --> 25:20.932
[sighs]

25:28.820 --> 25:31.323
I'm not sleeping,
I'm just thinking.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.125
You were right, ma'am.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.687
Of course I was. About what?

25:35.790 --> 25:39.829
Someone called Kathryn Hale's
cell phone just before
our team arrived.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.634
[dramatic music playing]

26:03.980 --> 26:06.039
[Reuel] You look like hell.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.779
[Bob] Wouldn't wanna
give anyone
the wrong impression.

26:10.660 --> 26:12.161
[Reuel] How's Lily holding up?

26:12.270 --> 26:14.363
She's just scared to death

26:14.470 --> 26:17.200
about what will happen
to her nephew.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.904
-You hungry?
-I'm okay, thanks.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.872
He'll have a malted.

26:26.240 --> 26:31.132
The weapon is made of
carbon-fiber-reinforced
thermoplastic

26:31.240 --> 26:33.185
to evade metal detectors.

26:33.290 --> 26:37.681
Small enough to be hidden under
clothes, light-weight enough
to be mounted on a drone.

26:38.650 --> 26:41.744
It reduces a liquid slurry

26:41.850 --> 26:45.035
of a plague virus

26:45.140 --> 26:48.496
into a fine particulate spray.

26:49.540 --> 26:52.179
It's invisible, odorless,

26:53.340 --> 26:54.284
silent.

26:54.390 --> 26:58.008
Victims breathe it in and...

26:58.110 --> 26:59.202
[cell phone vibrating]

26:59.310 --> 27:01.005
Oh, sorry.

27:01.110 --> 27:04.056
-It's my wife.
-You want some privacy?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.094
It's all right. Sweetheart?

27:06.200 --> 27:09.294
Kathryn Hale got a phone call
three minutes _before
my team arrived.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.552
It lasted 8 seconds
and originated from
a prepaid cell phone.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.539
What did the doctors say?

27:16.650 --> 27:20.029
I think Bob Partridge
has someone working friend
inside my office.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.984
Is this the only explanation?

27:22.090 --> 27:26.709
Yes. I need
a housekeep/ng team
sent 0 ver Immediate/y

27:26.820 --> 27:30.119
Of course.
Uh, can I bring you anything?

27:30.220 --> 27:31.835
His head.

27:31.940 --> 27:33.919
Okay. Will do.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.032
See you soon.

27:35.140 --> 27:37.005
Well, sorry.

27:37.110 --> 27:38.202
How's Melanie?

27:38.310 --> 27:42.462
Well, new problems
are piling on every day.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.893
Illness begets illness.
Now, just excuse me here
for a moment?

27:48.000 --> 27:52.118
I have to send myself
a reminder to pick up
ice cream for Melanie.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.711
Okay.

28:05.970 --> 28:08.473
Shepard, hold up a sec.

28:08.580 --> 28:11.014
-Let me talk to you
for a minute.
-What's up?

28:12.140 --> 28:13.994
-You Eel! me.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.591
-I don't know
what you're talking about.
-Just that you seem distracted.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.702
-Something going on?
-No.

28:19.350 --> 28:21.341
Yeah, maybe a little.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.804
-You're good at reading people.
-[Boyd chuckles]

28:24.910 --> 28:26.901
You wanna talk about it?

28:27.590 --> 28:29.649
No.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.136
Okay.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.174
I just need you to know
that you got my six out there.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.750
And that if you're dealing
with something, you're actually
dealing with it.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.321
Yeah, I'm cool.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.144
-Okay.
-Okay.

-You wanna grab a drink
or something after work?
-Are you serious?

28:47.730 --> 28:50.153
What do you mean?
Not like that.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.670
I'm married.

28:51.780 --> 28:52.997
Okay.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.773
There's... I need to get
something from my car.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.208
[clears throat]

29:12.320 --> 29:17.053
Considering the resources
that must've gone into
designing this weapon,

29:17.160 --> 29:20.505
are we contemplating
a potential
nation state design?

29:20.610 --> 29:22.987
We're contemplating everything.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.944
You wanna get that?

29:27.050 --> 29:30.304
Lily is the only person
who ever uses this number
during the day.

29:30.410 --> 29:31.957
Oh. I don't mind.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.051
-I'll call her on my way home.
-Okay.

29:40.580 --> 29:45.404
I've known you a very long time
and I know that you're loyal
to the agency,

29:45.510 --> 29:48.047
and I know that
you're loyal to your family.

29:48.150 --> 29:52.928
What happens when those
loyalties are brought
into a conflict,

29:53.040 --> 29:54.974
such as the one
we're havmg now?

29:55.080 --> 29:57.139
I don't believe we are.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.231
I'm telling you we are.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.065
My nephew didn't turn.

30:03.170 --> 30:04.979
Did you warn Joe

30:05.090 --> 30:08.025
Marty's team was on it's way
to Kathryn Hale's house?

30:08.130 --> 30:09.620
That's ridiculous.

30:09.730 --> 30:12.267
Well, someone called
Hale's cell phone minutes

30:12.370 --> 30:13.792
before the task force arrived.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.949
I never heard of Kathy Hale
till this morning.

30:17.060 --> 30:19.176
How was I supposed to know
she was with Joe?

30:21.340 --> 30:23.342
Would you take a polygraph?

30:23.830 --> 30:24.967
Of course.

30:25.070 --> 30:27.061
And you'd pass it too,
wouldn't you?

30:27.510 --> 30:30.001
[sighs]

30:30.110 --> 30:32.283
Well, you haven't even
touched your milkshake.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.255
Is this Marty's theory?

30:38.040 --> 30:41.612
-that she could be objective.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.494
Are you sure
you don't need to get that?

30:43.600 --> 30:45.386
I told you, it's just my wife.

30:45.490 --> 30:49.688
Twice in a row, I mean,
maybe... Maybe she
needs something.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.757

is everything okay?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.930
[cell phone ringing]

31:06.190 --> 31:09.045
See that you called twice.
I'm in a meeting, though.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.300
Let me talk to Lily.
I wanna say hello.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.817
Sweetheart,

-I’m fine.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.104
How’s Melanie?

31:28.210 --> 31:31.384
I'll tell her that you asked
after her and I'm sure
she'll be pleased.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.663
I ’m sorry for the interruption.

31:33.770 --> 31:36.694
-No, don't be silly.
-May I speak with my husband?

31:37.300 --> 31:39.291
Please.

-Are we done here?
-For now.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.101
It's good.

31:55.190 --> 31:57.294
Hi, sweetheart.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.571

[cell phone vibrating]

32:20.460 --> 32:22.451
I heard what you did.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.431
What did I do?

32:24.540 --> 32:26.269
Aren't you the one
who found Turner?

32:26.380 --> 32:28.371
Uh, not really.

32:29.430 --> 32:31.443
Got another slice?

32:31.550 --> 32:32.528
Hmm.

32:32.630 --> 32:34.621
Sorry, my last piece.

32:35.470 --> 32:36.880
Are you gonna get that?

32:36.990 --> 32:39.550
Mmm. It's just my mum.

[speaking in Arabic]

32:44.560 --> 32:46.209
What does that mean?

32:46.320 --> 32:48.538
It's an Arabic saying
about mothers.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.642
Doesn't really translate.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.925
-I should--

35:10.940 --> 35:12.931
[Kathy] Why did you do that?

35:14.500 --> 35:16.081
Why didn't you scream?

35:16.190 --> 35:17.248
I don't know.

35:17.350 --> 35:19.489
Maybe I was afraid
you'd hurt someone else.

35:19.590 --> 35:21.603
No.

35:21.710 --> 35:23.246
I think you know.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.648
You don't trust people,
you have good instinct
for them.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.537
I think you see the truth
when you look in someone
else's eyes,

35:28.640 --> 35:30.130
and I think a part of you

35:30.240 --> 35:32.231
already knows you can trust me.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.739
I did not kill those people.

35:37.850 --> 35:40.739
But if they find me
before I figure out who did,

35:40.850 --> 35:42.624
I will be dead
and so will the truth.

And I'm sorry that I came here.
I don't know why I did.

35:46.210 --> 35:48.815
But this is not me,
this is not who I am.

Wait, if they find you,
just don't give them any reason
to think you know anything.

Because then I would
be in danger?

his family to Beirut

of American imperialism
had a gun?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.859
Apparently.

38:58.960 --> 38:59.870
That doesn't really square away
with what your aunt
was saying--

38:59.960 --> 39:02.053
So, so, go ask my aunt.

What do you want me
to tell you, Janice?

but your uncle is a fuck.

Oh, my God.
You don't even know the guy.

with someone at work.

-Yeah, she told me when you
guys were up in the office...

on the road please.

as they walk by.

themselves

How is that a force for good
in the world?

for any kind of
meaningful social change.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.197
And what about the enjoyment
that you get from
watching them suffer?

40:06.300 --> 40:08.188
Is that a prerequisite?

40:08.300 --> 40:09.824
It's not their suffering
I enjoy seeing, it's the moment
they wake up.

with the system so clearly,

-No, no, no.

happened today.

and you ran over
a fucking deer.

and your uncle.

-Don't push me away like this.

-It's in your head.
-Real|y?

I can't be with someone
who can look me in the eye
and lie like that.

-Fine, I'll get out
of your hair.
-That's it?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.988
You're just gonna admit
that you're lying?

40:42.100 --> 40:43.579
What do you want me
to tell you, Janice? You want
me to make something up?

40:43.660 --> 40:44.991

I don't know, I just, uh...

41:41.470 --> 41:45.099
I just think you and I
want different things.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.452
That's not...
That's not what I mean.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.778
You can leave if you want. I...

41:49.880 --> 41:53.862
Wow. For a second there
I though you were
gonna be vulnerable.

41:53.970 --> 41:57.098
Don't act like I'm the one
who has trouble
being vulnerable.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.485
-I just mean...
-Yeah?

42:00.250 --> 42:02.229
What did you mean?

42:02.330 --> 42:05.857
When they let me out
of that room, I thought
of your Uncle Bob.

42:08.580 --> 42:12.277
I didn't know why at first,
but then I realized I could
still smell his cologne

42:12.380 --> 42:15.144
in the hallway.
I know he was there.

42:20.110 --> 42:21.680
You can leave me
if you want to,

42:21.790 --> 42:25.100
but whatever it is
your uncle wants you to do,
don't do it.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.252
You're a smart guy, Joe.

42:29.360 --> 42:33.148
You just... You just
got a shit sense of smell.

Did you ever consider it?

42:38.810 --> 42:42.064
[Joe]
What? That my uncle
got me arrested just so
he could come to my rescue?

42:42.170 --> 42:46.379
That he used the people I cared
about most as a tool
to recruit me into the CIA?

42:48.060 --> 42:49.311
Yeah. I...

42:49.420 --> 42:51.411
I guess
it's pretty obvious he did.

42:54.980 --> 42:58.302
Maybe Janice was right,
maybe I am a bad judge
of character.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.170
Thanks for staying.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.748

for you to have made it up.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.341
[cameraman] And we're rolling.

44:00.450 --> 44:02.384
I wanna talk about
the 11 men and women

_ that_ were murdered
in the offices of a Georgetown
tech firm yesterday.

44:06.170 --> 44:08.343
The government would
have you believe
they were just civilians

44:08.450 --> 44:11.476
caught in the shooting,
but that's not the real story.

44:11.580 --> 44:14.435

members and they were targeted.

44:37.080 --> 44:40.379
IEP Analytics wasn ’t really
a tech company at a//.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.222
It was a CIA front.

44:43.330 --> 44:46.584
IEP, it just so happens,
was also the outﬁt

44:46.690 --> 44:49.488
