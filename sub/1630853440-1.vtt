<i>Today, we're looking at</i>

05:02.151 --> 05:03.319
Hey.

05:07.789 --> 05:09.024
What is it?

05:11.327 --> 05:12.327
What?

05:12.428 --> 05:14.230
We've been ordered
to stand down.

05:14.363 --> 05:16.031
They're scrapping the program.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.934
They say we fell short.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.170
The contract threshold
is mach 10.

05:21.303 --> 05:23.606
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

05:23.738 --> 05:25.541
Today's test point is mach 9.

05:25.674 --> 05:27.476
Well, that's not good enough.

05:27.610 --> 05:28.843
Says who?

05:28.978 --> 05:30.845
Admiral Cain.

05:31.846 --> 05:33.148
The drone ranger.

05:33.282 --> 05:35.618
He wants our budget for
his unmanned program.

05:35.749 --> 05:39.786
He's on his way
to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

05:53.134 --> 05:55.036
Well, he isn't here yet.

05:59.007 --> 06:00.408
They want mach 10,

06:01.042 --> 06:02.443
let's give 'em mach 10.

06:20.228 --> 06:23.097
Now remember,
the contract threshold
is mach 10.

06:23.231 --> 06:26.768
Not 10.1. Not 10.2.
Mach 10.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.137
That should keep
the program alive.

06:31.838 --> 06:33.508
I don't like that look, mav.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.145
It's the only one I got.

06:45.653 --> 06:48.289
<i>Control, this is</i> darkstar.
<i>How do you read?</i>

06:48.423 --> 06:50.658
<i>Darkstar,</i> control.
Loud and clear. How me?

06:50.792 --> 06:54.128
Loud and clear.
Takeoff precheck's complete.
Ready for apu start.

06:54.262 --> 06:57.231
<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

06:58.800 --> 07:00.401
<i>Ready right engine start.</i>

07:01.469 --> 07:02.570
Thumbs for taxi.

07:04.939 --> 07:06.708
We are ready for taxi.

07:07.975 --> 07:11.412
Tower, this is <i>darkstar.</i>
We are taxiing
with information Alpha.

07:11.546 --> 07:13.626
Darkstar, <i>you are clear to taxi.</i>

07:13.748 --> 07:16.417
<i>Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.</i>

07:16.551 --> 07:18.885

<i>- Control concurs.</i>

07:19.020 --> 07:21.689
<i>Battery's holding at 95%.</i>
<i>Cabin pressure looks good.</i>

07:21.823 --> 07:24.703
<i>Control concurs.</i>
<i>Tower, this is</i> darkstar.
<i>We're ready for takeoff.</i>

07:24.826 --> 07:27.729
<i>Requesting</i>
<i>an unrestricted climb</i>
<i>to 600 and above.</i>

07:27.861 --> 07:30.331
Darkstar, <i>the runway</i>
<i>and skies are yours.</i>

07:30.465 --> 07:32.899
Rear admiral Chester Cain.

07:33.034 --> 07:36.037
Maverick,
Cain just pulled up to the gate.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.339
It's not too late to stop,
buddy.

07:39.374 --> 07:42.443
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

07:43.811 --> 07:46.614
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.017
Darkstar <i>is ready for takeoff.</i>

07:53.787 --> 07:54.988
Everyone,

07:55.122 --> 07:57.624
go for takeoff,
starting with engine.

07:57.758 --> 07:59.526
Engine, go.
Thermals, go.

07:59.659 --> 08:01.595
Fuel, go.
Electric, go.

08:01.728 --> 08:03.296
Control surfaces, go.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.832
Darkstar, <i>control.</i>
<i>You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

08:05.966 --> 08:07.634
All right, sweetheart,

08:08.135 --> 08:09.403
one last ride.

08:34.861 --> 08:38.999
Darkstar,
<i>you are cleared above 600.</i>
<i>Increase to mach 3.5.</i>

08:39.131 --> 08:43.236
Cleared above 600.
Increase to mach 3.5.

08:49.476 --> 08:50.544
Admiral.

08:50.677 --> 08:53.713
Uh, just in time, sir.
I'm early. So are you.

08:53.847 --> 08:55.148
You care to explain?

08:55.282 --> 08:57.484
Transitioning to scramjet.

09:11.031 --> 09:13.033
Uh, mav,
admiral Cain is asking...

09:13.166 --> 09:15.469
Ordering.
Ordering that we
bring her down.

09:15.602 --> 09:17.962
<i>Op... oop... Alpha...</i>

09:18.071 --> 09:19.272

09:22.809 --> 09:24.511
<i>within six...</i>

09:24.644 --> 09:26.524
This is where we've had
trouble with comms, sir.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.950
It's the earth's curvature.
It's called "earth bulge."

09:29.082 --> 09:30.584
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

09:32.352 --> 09:33.352
Okay.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.829
He's at mach 7, pushing 8.

09:42.964 --> 09:45.365
Flight data?
Receiving. Data is good.

09:50.237 --> 09:53.807
Temperature's climbing.
Response is still stable.
We're feeling good.

09:57.711 --> 09:59.112
<i>Mach 8.8.</i>

09:59.880 --> 10:01.114
8.9.

10:01.581 --> 10:02.749
Mach 9.

10:02.883 --> 10:04.684
He's the fastest man alive.

10:23.869 --> 10:25.604
Talk to me, goose.

10:27.573 --> 10:28.707
Mach 9.1.

10:29.675 --> 10:30.709
9.2.

10:37.918 --> 10:39.318
Mach 9.3.

10:41.854 --> 10:43.255
9.4.

10:44.423 --> 10:46.625
Approaching high hypersonic.

10:58.904 --> 11:00.573
Windshield hot caution.

11:08.714 --> 11:11.383
Surface temp rising.

11:16.455 --> 11:18.657
Come on, sweetheart,
just a little more.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.327
Just a little.

11:24.163 --> 11:25.264
Come on!

11:31.770 --> 11:32.770
Come on!

11:38.044 --> 11:40.613
Mach 10!

11:41.580 --> 11:43.682
Put that
in your Pentagon budget!

11:45.584 --> 11:46.785
Sir.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.531
Oh, don't do it.
Don't do it.

11:59.665 --> 12:00.699
Just...

12:02.401 --> 12:04.770
A little push.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.576
Holy shit.

12:19.818 --> 12:22.988
You got some balls,
stick jockey.

12:23.122 --> 12:24.389
I'll give you that.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.228
Oh, shit.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.467
Maverick.

12:38.269 --> 12:39.737
Maverick!

13:29.922 --> 13:31.222
Thank you.

13:31.856 --> 13:33.558
Where am I?

13:34.358 --> 13:35.760
Earth.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.409
<i>Maverick.</i>

13:51.542 --> 13:54.245
Thirty-plus years of service.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.614
Combat medals.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.217
Citations.

13:58.349 --> 14:03.287
Only man to shoot down
three enemy planes
in the last 40 years.

14:03.821 --> 14:05.057
"Distinguished."

14:05.190 --> 14:08.793
"Distinguished."
"distinguished."

14:10.294 --> 14:13.631
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

14:13.765 --> 14:16.734
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

14:16.868 --> 14:22.007
You should be at least
a two-star admiral by now,
if not a senator.

14:22.141 --> 14:23.875
Yet here you are:

14:25.376 --> 14:26.677
Captain.

14:27.512 --> 14:28.880
Why is that?

14:29.647 --> 14:31.049
It's one of
life's mysteries, sir.

14:31.183 --> 14:34.685
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

14:36.654 --> 14:38.688
I'm where I belong, sir.

14:38.822 --> 14:41.926
Well, the Navy
doesn't see it that way.

14:42.927 --> 14:44.028
Not anymore.

14:45.395 --> 14:47.397
These planes
you've been testing,

14:47.932 --> 14:49.267
captain,

14:49.399 --> 14:52.836
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

14:52.970 --> 14:56.740
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

14:58.675 --> 15:01.045
Pilots that disobey orders.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.549
All you did
was buy some time for
those men out there.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.819
The future is coming,

15:09.619 --> 15:11.721
and you're not in it.

15:13.423 --> 15:15.725
Escort this man off the base.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.395
Take him to his quarters.

15:18.528 --> 15:21.331
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

15:23.167 --> 15:26.703
I want him on the road
to north island
within the hour.

15:30.007 --> 15:31.541
North island, sir?

15:32.342 --> 15:34.377
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

15:34.511 --> 15:39.317
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass
once and for all.

15:39.449 --> 15:42.686
It galls me to say it, but...

15:43.955 --> 15:47.824
For reasons known
only to the almighty
and your guardian angel...

15:49.626 --> 15:52.362
You've been called back
to topgun.

15:56.267 --> 15:59.836
Sir?
You are dismissed,
captain.

16:04.808 --> 16:07.477
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

16:07.611 --> 16:09.846
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.086
Maybe so, sir.

16:16.586 --> 16:18.388
But not today.

17:23.019 --> 17:26.488
<i>Captain Pete</i>
<i>"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

17:26.622 --> 17:28.757
Your reputation precedes you.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.027
Thank you, sir.

17:32.262 --> 17:33.862
Wasn't a compliment.

17:35.198 --> 17:37.533
I'm admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the air boss.

17:37.666 --> 17:40.136
I believe
you know admiral bates.
Warlock, sir.

17:40.270 --> 17:43.006
Must admit,
I wasn't expecting
an invitation back.

17:43.139 --> 17:45.208
They're called orders, Maverick.

17:46.475 --> 17:47.810
You two have
something in common.

17:47.944 --> 17:50.713
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

17:50.846 --> 17:52.983
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

17:53.116 --> 17:55.784
Just want to manage
expectations.

17:59.722 --> 18:01.157
The target...

18:03.026 --> 18:05.728
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

18:05.861 --> 18:08.164
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

18:08.298 --> 18:11.401
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

18:11.533 --> 18:12.701
to our allies in the region.

18:12.835 --> 18:14.304
The Pentagon has tasked us

18:14.437 --> 18:16.973
with assembling
a strike team
and taking it out

18:17.107 --> 18:19.575
before it becomes
fully operational.

18:19.708 --> 18:23.712
The plant sits
in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

18:23.846 --> 18:25.348
Said valley is GPS-jammed

18:25.482 --> 18:28.218
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

18:28.351 --> 18:31.054
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

18:31.187 --> 18:35.291
which in turn are backed up
by a plentiful reserve
of surplus aircraft.

18:35.425 --> 18:37.427
Even a few old f-14s.

18:37.559 --> 18:40.196
Seems like
we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.100
What's your read, captain?

18:45.402 --> 18:49.305
Well, sir, normally
this would be a cakewalk
for the f-35's stealth,

18:49.439 --> 18:51.740
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

18:51.874 --> 18:55.811
And a surface-to-air threat
necessitates a low-level
laser-guided strike

18:55.945 --> 18:57.414
tailor-made for the f-18.

18:57.546 --> 18:58.982
I figure,

18:59.115 --> 19:01.017
two precision bombs, minimum.

19:01.151 --> 19:04.054
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

19:04.187 --> 19:06.256
That is one hell
of a steep climb
out of there,

19:06.389 --> 19:09.058
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

19:09.624 --> 19:11.060
You survive that,

19:12.027 --> 19:13.462
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

19:13.594 --> 19:16.898
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.600
Not in the same mission, sir.

19:22.171 --> 19:23.205
No.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.343
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

19:28.477 --> 19:29.777
Can it be done or not?

19:29.912 --> 19:32.381
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

19:32.514 --> 19:34.383
Three weeks. Maybe less.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.320
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an f-18,
and...

19:39.354 --> 19:41.656
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.858
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

19:43.992 --> 19:45.928
I think you misunderstand,
captain.

19:46.361 --> 19:47.361
Sir?

19:47.463 --> 19:49.298
We don't want you to fly it.

19:49.431 --> 19:50.832
We want you to teach it.

19:53.535 --> 19:54.970
Teach, sir?

19:56.205 --> 19:59.740
We've recalled
12 topgun graduates
from their squadrons.

19:59.874 --> 20:02.277
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

20:03.145 --> 20:05.080
They'll fly the mission.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.183
Is there a problem, captain?

20:09.884 --> 20:12.354
You know there is, sir.

20:13.589 --> 20:14.590
Yeah.

20:14.722 --> 20:17.159
Bradley bradshaw,
aka "rooster."

20:17.292 --> 20:19.361
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

20:19.495 --> 20:21.363
What was his call sign?

20:22.131 --> 20:23.565
"Goose," sir.

20:23.698 --> 20:25.000
Tragic what happened.

20:25.134 --> 20:26.934
Captain Mitchell
was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

20:27.035 --> 20:28.836
Goose's death was an accident.

20:28.971 --> 20:30.611
Is that how you see it, captain?

20:30.738 --> 20:33.041
Is that how goose's son sees it?

20:35.843 --> 20:38.746
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.349
You were a topgun
instructor before.

20:40.482 --> 20:42.951
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

20:43.085 --> 20:44.419
It's not where I belong.

20:44.553 --> 20:46.421
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

20:46.555 --> 20:50.725
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't
even on the list.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.861
You are here at the request
of admiral kazansky.

20:53.996 --> 20:57.466
Now, iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

20:57.599 --> 21:01.036
and he seems to think
that you have something left
to offer the Navy.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.771
What that is, I can't imagine.

21:05.107 --> 21:07.142
You don't have to take this job.

21:07.276 --> 21:08.276
But let me be clear:

21:08.343 --> 21:11.513
This will be your last post,
captain.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.884
You fly for topgun,
or you don't fly for the Navy
ever again.

21:25.092 --> 21:27.195
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

22:08.302 --> 22:10.605
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

22:13.341 --> 22:14.442
Pete.

22:15.710 --> 22:16.743
Penny?

22:16.876 --> 22:19.080
What are you doing here?

22:19.213 --> 22:21.349
I should ask you the same thing.

22:22.316 --> 22:24.619
Well, that is a long story.
I doubt that.

22:24.751 --> 22:25.752
Yeah.

22:25.885 --> 22:27.455
Who'd you piss off this time?

22:27.588 --> 22:29.056
Another admiral.

22:29.190 --> 22:30.224
Exactly.

22:32.859 --> 22:35.463
Are you mad at me?
Oh, Pete.

22:35.596 --> 22:39.133
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

22:39.267 --> 22:40.267
Huh.

22:40.368 --> 22:42.937
I got to say, north island
is the one place

22:43.070 --> 22:44.871
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

22:45.006 --> 22:46.907
Mmm.
How long you been here?

22:47.041 --> 22:48.808
Bought this place
about three years ago.

22:48.943 --> 22:51.012
Three years?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

22:51.145 --> 22:55.516
Not long after you got
shipped off to the desert for
pissing off that other admiral.

22:56.217 --> 22:58.552
That was three years ago?

22:59.420 --> 23:01.689
You must be in a lot of trouble.

23:01.821 --> 23:04.525
No way you'd come
back here willingly.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.361
Well,

23:08.029 --> 23:09.930
you'll sort it out.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.831
No, I think, uh...

23:12.899 --> 23:15.236
I think this is it.
Come on, Pete.

23:15.369 --> 23:17.905
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

23:18.039 --> 23:21.676
You said it after
they busted you for taking me
on a joyride in that f-18.

23:21.808 --> 23:24.878
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

23:25.012 --> 23:28.049
Then Iraq. Both times.

23:28.182 --> 23:29.883
You get yourself in trouble,

23:30.785 --> 23:33.820
iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.523
Penny, this is different.

23:35.656 --> 23:36.991
Pete, trust me,

23:37.124 --> 23:39.259
as improbable
as it seems right now,

23:39.392 --> 23:43.096
somehow you'll be back
in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

23:43.997 --> 23:45.732
Penny...
Too late.

23:45.864 --> 23:47.067
What?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.369
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.541
Don't give me that look.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.678
I'm not giving you any look.
I swear.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.448
It always ends
the same with us, Pete.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.918
Let's not start this time.

24:09.222 --> 24:10.222
Okay.

24:43.623 --> 24:46.559
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.529
Oh, come on!

24:49.662 --> 24:52.065

24:55.668 --> 24:58.438

we were special, coyote.

went to anyone.

25:05.044 --> 25:06.780

25:06.913 --> 25:09.416
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

25:09.549 --> 25:11.284
with a confirmed
air-to-air kill.

25:11.418 --> 25:12.452

25:20.160 --> 25:21.594
Who are your friends?

25:21.728 --> 25:23.663

I'm admiral bates,
nawdc commander.

32:58.714 --> 33:00.749
You're all topgun graduates.

33:01.351 --> 33:02.517
The elite.

33:02.651 --> 33:05.188
The best of the best.

33:05.321 --> 33:07.890
That was yesterday.

33:08.024 --> 33:11.961
The enemy's
new fifth-generation fighter
has leveled the playing field.

33:12.095 --> 33:13.729
Details are few,
but you can be sure

33:13.862 --> 33:16.032
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

33:16.165 --> 33:19.335
Success, now more than ever,

33:19.468 --> 33:22.704
comes down to the man or woman
in the box.

33:23.538 --> 33:25.707
Half of you will make the cut.

33:25.841 --> 33:27.676
One of you will
be named mission leader.

33:27.809 --> 33:30.846
The other half
will remain in reserve.

33:31.948 --> 33:33.882
Your instructor
is a topgun graduate

33:34.017 --> 33:36.585
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

33:36.718 --> 33:38.587
you will be expected to master.

33:39.355 --> 33:41.723
His exploits are legendary.

33:42.891 --> 33:45.161
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

33:45.295 --> 33:47.529
this program has ever produced.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.133
What he has to teach you

33:50.266 --> 33:53.903
may very well
mean the difference
between life and death.

33:54.636 --> 33:57.106

captain Pete Mitchell.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.976
Call sign: "Maverick."

34:04.680 --> 34:05.915
Good morning.

34:14.190 --> 34:15.891
The f-18 natops.

34:17.193 --> 34:21.630
It contains everything
they want you to know
about your aircraft.

34:21.763 --> 34:24.565
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.034
Damn right.
Damn straight.

34:26.168 --> 34:27.536
You got it.

34:35.344 --> 34:36.678
So does your enemy.

34:36.812 --> 34:39.047
And we're off.

34:40.016 --> 34:43.219
But what the enemy
doesn't know is your limits.

34:43.851 --> 34:45.587
I intend to find them,

34:45.721 --> 34:47.589
test them,

34:48.056 --> 34:49.225

34:50.360 --> 34:54.197

35:12.513 --> 35:14.515

35:15.417 --> 35:17.085
You gonna wash me out?

35:17.919 --> 35:19.921
That'll be up to you, not me.

35:22.124 --> 35:23.657
Am I dismissed?

35:40.875 --> 35:43.345
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

35:43.478 --> 35:45.813
Welcome to basic
fighter maneuvers.

35:47.015 --> 35:49.918
<i>As briefed, today's exercise
is dogfighting.</i>

35:50.052 --> 35:51.987
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

35:52.988 --> 35:55.790
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

35:55.924 --> 35:58.793
<i>Working as a team, you have
to shoot me down, or else.</i>

35:58.927 --> 36:02.130
Or else what, sir?
Or else I shoot back.

36:02.264 --> 36:05.133
<i>If I shoot</i>
<i>either one of you down,</i>
<i>you both lose.</i>

36:05.267 --> 36:08.437
This guy needs an ego check.
We'll see to that.

36:08.569 --> 36:11.239
What say we
put some skin in the game?
What do you have in mind?

36:11.373 --> 36:14.409
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

36:14.543 --> 36:17.079
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

36:17.212 --> 36:19.448

call it an exercise
for nothing, sir.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.450

Leaving your wingman.

38:36.116 --> 38:37.876
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

38:37.918 --> 38:40.187
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

38:40.321 --> 38:41.788
So long as he doesn't
call you a man.

38:41.922 --> 38:43.823

What is with these two?

40:21.820 --> 40:25.525
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

40:25.658 --> 40:28.061
You can bail out anytime.

40:28.194 --> 40:29.696
How low you want to go, rooster?

40:29.828 --> 40:33.166
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

40:36.569 --> 40:38.538
What's past is past.
For both of us.

40:38.671 --> 40:40.473
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

40:40.606 --> 40:44.544
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

40:44.677 --> 40:47.680
<i>Altitude.
</i> Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.

40:47.814 --> 40:50.516

<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>

40:50.650 --> 40:52.185
<i>Altitude.</i>

40:53.619 --> 40:56.622
<i>Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.</i>

Don't think, just do.

41:10.903 --> 41:14.407
Come on, rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

41:15.874 --> 41:17.043
It's too low.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.645
Too late. You had your chance.

41:25.718 --> 41:28.554
That's a kill. Knock it off.

41:29.522 --> 41:30.556
Damn it!

41:30.690 --> 41:32.625
Same old rooster.

41:35.027 --> 41:37.530
Go see hondo
about your push-ups.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.005
All right, that's enough.

41:47.139 --> 41:50.108
Rooster.
That's enough, man.

42:03.989 --> 42:07.859
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
 Are you trying to get kicked out?

42:07.993 --> 42:09.461
Don't worry about it.

42:09.594 --> 42:12.431
Look, I'm going on this mission.

42:13.598 --> 42:15.918
But if you get kicked out,
you leave us flying
with hangman.

42:16.034 --> 42:20.505
Talk to me.
What the hell was that?
He pulled my papers.

42:20.639 --> 42:24.209
What? Who?
Maverick.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.013
He pulled my application
to the naval academy.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.082
Set me back four years.

42:33.285 --> 42:35.053
Why would he do that?

42:40.425 --> 42:42.861
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.263
A parameter is set
not just for the safety
of our pilots,

42:45.397 --> 42:47.065
but for the safety
of their aircraft.

42:47.199 --> 42:51.303
5,000 feet is not
just a rule. It is a law,
as immutable as gravity.

42:51.436 --> 42:54.105
The hard deck
will be much lower
for the mission, sir.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.275
And it will not change
without my approval!

42:57.409 --> 42:59.277
Especially not
in the middle of an exercise.

42:59.411 --> 43:03.215
And that cobra maneuver
of yours? That could've got
all three of you killed.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.283
I never want to see
that shit again.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.553
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, captain?

43:08.687 --> 43:11.065
That as good as they are,
sir, they still have
something to learn.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.769
You are talking about
the best fighter pilots
on the planet, captain.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.665
And they've been told that
their entire career,

43:15.694 --> 43:17.538
while they've
been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

43:17.562 --> 43:19.598
with little to no dogfighting.

43:19.731 --> 43:22.243
The parameters of this mission
call for something they
have never encountered.

43:22.267 --> 43:26.872
Okay, you have less
than three weeks to teach them
how to fight as a team

43:27.005 --> 43:28.206
and how to strike the target.

43:28.340 --> 43:30.375
And how to come home.

43:33.011 --> 43:35.247
And how to come home, sir.

43:40.585 --> 43:43.154
Every mission has its risks.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.023
These pilots accept that.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.058
I don't, sir.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.330
Every morning,
from this day forward,

43:52.464 --> 43:54.833
you will brief us on
your instructional plans
in writing.

43:54.967 --> 43:57.835
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.539
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck,
captain.

44:03.574 --> 44:04.675
Sir.

44:05.576 --> 44:06.644
What is this?

44:06.777 --> 44:08.579
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

44:08.712 --> 44:11.181
to practice
a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.757
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, captain.

44:20.391 --> 44:21.592
<i>Yo, coyote.</i>

44:22.126 --> 44:23.594
Take a look at this.

44:27.298 --> 44:30.001
The man, the legend.
There he is.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.369
No, no, no.
Next to him.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.372
He look familiar to you?

44:37.074 --> 44:38.809
What have we here?

44:39.410 --> 44:41.412
Bradshaw.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.114
As I live and breathe.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.720
Hey, Theo, you got big.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.388
Hey, mav.

44:58.729 --> 44:59.729
Amelia?

44:59.830 --> 45:01.198
I know. I got big.

45:01.332 --> 45:02.766
Yes.

45:03.801 --> 45:04.970
Bar opens at 5:00.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.838
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

45:07.973 --> 45:09.406
Mom!

45:13.744 --> 45:16.847
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

45:16.982 --> 45:18.515
Mom!

45:19.249 --> 45:21.785
Mav says he owes you money.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.189
Oh. Don't worry
about it.
I insist.

45:27.959 --> 45:31.896
Thank you, captain.
Consider your tab closed.

45:32.863 --> 45:34.498
Captain? Still?

45:34.632 --> 45:37.501
A highly decorated captain.

45:37.635 --> 45:38.502
Finish up.

45:38.636 --> 45:40.304
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

45:40.437 --> 45:42.339
I can't go.
What do you mean,
you can't go?

45:42.473 --> 45:45.676
Test tomorrow.
I have to study.
They only told us today.

45:45.809 --> 45:47.912
Well, I can't sail her alone.

45:48.046 --> 45:49.313
Just use the engine.

45:49.446 --> 45:51.715
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

45:51.849 --> 45:53.450
To fix the engine.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.719
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

46:01.692 --> 46:04.795
Little rougher than I was expecting.
 You don't say.

46:04.929 --> 46:08.732
Pull on the backstay.
We'll de-power the sails.

46:08.866 --> 46:10.167
Okay.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.201
What does that mean?

46:13.302 --> 46:15.438
You're supposed to be
in the Navy!

46:15.571 --> 46:19.342
I don't sail boats, penny.
I land on them.

46:19.475 --> 46:22.779
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

46:22.913 --> 46:24.480
So how do I do that?

46:24.614 --> 46:27.216
You pull on that
green line up there.

46:27.350 --> 46:28.818
Green line.

46:31.220 --> 46:32.588
Yep. Pull it hard.

46:32.722 --> 46:35.792
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

46:35.926 --> 46:37.794
tighten the jib.

46:38.428 --> 46:40.830
Crank it.
You okay?
Yeah.

46:42.231 --> 46:43.433
Good.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.635
Now,

46:46.937 --> 46:48.304
you ready?

46:50.206 --> 46:51.808
For what?

46:51.942 --> 46:53.609
The afterburner.

47:13.629 --> 47:15.732
Now you're in the Navy.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.822
Thanks for helping out today.

47:41.357 --> 47:42.926
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.929
Hmm.

47:48.264 --> 47:49.799
Don't give me that look.

47:49.933 --> 47:51.135
What look?

47:51.267 --> 47:53.003
That one.

47:56.206 --> 47:57.673
Good night, Pete.

47:58.274 --> 47:59.776
Night, penny.

48:15.125 --> 48:17.094
Mom, is that you?

48:17.227 --> 48:18.694
Yeah, it's me.

48:19.462 --> 48:21.165
I'll make you dinner.

48:21.297 --> 48:22.532
Okay.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.872
Time is your greatest enemy.

48:32.008 --> 48:34.243
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

48:34.376 --> 48:35.912
attacking in two-plane teams.

48:36.045 --> 48:38.747
You'll fly along
this narrow canyon
to your target.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.350
Radar-guided
surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

48:42.484 --> 48:45.087
These sams, they're lethal.

48:45.221 --> 48:49.058
But they were designed
to protect the skies above,
not the canyon below.

48:49.192 --> 48:53.162
That's because the enemy
knows no one is insane enough
to try and fly below them.

48:54.163 --> 48:56.832
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

48:56.966 --> 49:01.336
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

49:01.469 --> 49:02.804
You exceed this altitude...

49:02.939 --> 49:05.340
Radar will spot you

49:05.473 --> 49:07.843
and you're dead.

49:07.977 --> 49:10.378
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

49:11.013 --> 49:12.013
minimum.

49:12.081 --> 49:14.317
Time to target:
Two and a half minutes.

49:14.449 --> 49:19.421
That's because
fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

49:19.554 --> 49:23.859
In a head-to-head
with these planes
in your f-18s, you're dead.

49:25.061 --> 49:27.762
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

49:27.897 --> 49:30.967
before these planes
even have a chance
of catching you.

49:31.100 --> 49:34.203
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

49:35.637 --> 49:39.674
<i>You'll fly a route</i>
<i>in your nav system</i>
<i>that simulates the canyon.</i>

49:39.808 --> 49:41.676
<i>The faster you navigate
this canyon,</i>

49:41.810 --> 49:44.379
<i>the harder it'll be</i>
<i>to stay under the radar</i>
<i>of these enemy sams.</i>

49:44.512 --> 49:46.481
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

49:46.615 --> 49:48.317
<i>the more intensely
the force of gravity</i>

49:48.450 --> 49:50.385
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>

49:50.518 --> 49:52.054
<i>compressing your lungs...</i>

49:52.188 --> 49:54.623
<i>forcing the blood</i>
<i>from your brain...</i>

49:54.756 --> 49:56.893
<i>impairing your judgment
and reaction time.</i>

49:57.026 --> 49:59.461
So for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy
on you.

49:59.594 --> 50:02.831
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: Three minutes.

50:04.499 --> 50:05.902
Good luck.

50:14.010 --> 50:15.844
Time to target
is one minute 30.

50:15.978 --> 50:18.381
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

50:18.513 --> 50:19.949
We got to move, coyote.

50:20.649 --> 50:22.285
Copy. Increasing speed.

50:22.417 --> 50:23.685
Oh!

50:24.853 --> 50:25.853
Oh, shit!

50:29.025 --> 50:30.192
Why are they dead?

50:30.326 --> 50:33.296
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a Sam took us out.

50:33.428 --> 50:35.064
No. Why are they dead?

50:35.197 --> 50:37.408
I slowed down and didn't
give her a warning.
It was my fault.

50:37.432 --> 50:40.502
Was there a reason you didn't
communicate with your team?
I was focusing on...

50:40.635 --> 50:43.305
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

50:43.437 --> 50:44.638
None, sir.

50:45.639 --> 50:46.999
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

50:47.042 --> 50:48.609
You were briefed on the terrain.

50:48.742 --> 50:51.947
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

50:57.052 --> 50:59.620
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

50:59.753 --> 51:02.424
Negative, payback.
Increase your speed.

51:03.724 --> 51:07.628
You're going too fast, man.
No harm in being
ahead of schedule.

51:09.364 --> 51:12.267
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

51:12.400 --> 51:15.502
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

51:18.839 --> 51:21.542
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

51:21.675 --> 51:23.477
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

51:23.610 --> 51:27.215
And you put your team in danger,
and your wingman's dead.

51:28.350 --> 51:30.018
They couldn't keep up.

51:35.689 --> 51:38.525
<i>Rooster,</i>
<i>we're 20 seconds behind</i>
<i>and dropping.</i>

51:38.659 --> 51:41.262
We're fine. Speed is good.

51:41.396 --> 51:43.031
Increase to 500 knots.

51:43.164 --> 51:45.866
Negative, Yale.
Hold your speed.
<i>Rooster, we're late!</i>

51:46.001 --> 51:48.769
We're alive.
We'll make up time
in the straightaway.

51:48.903 --> 51:50.305
<i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

51:50.438 --> 51:53.574
Just trust me.
Maintain your speed.
We can make it.

51:53.707 --> 51:55.809
Why are you dead?

51:55.944 --> 51:57.445
You're team leader up there.

51:57.578 --> 51:59.981
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

52:00.115 --> 52:02.783
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

52:02.917 --> 52:04.919
A minute late.

52:05.053 --> 52:07.521
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

52:07.654 --> 52:09.424
He is dead.
You don't know that.

52:09.556 --> 52:13.128
You're not flying
fast enough. You don't
have a second to waste.

52:13.261 --> 52:14.929
We made it to the target.

52:15.063 --> 52:18.033
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

52:18.166 --> 52:21.102
Then it's a dogfight.
Against
fifth-generation fighters.

52:21.236 --> 52:23.837
Yeah.
We'd still have a chance.
In an f-18.

52:23.972 --> 52:26.508
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.976
Exactly!

52:34.882 --> 52:37.519
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

52:37.651 --> 52:39.287
You really don't get it.

52:40.422 --> 52:43.291
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

52:43.425 --> 52:45.326
or a man does not come back.

52:46.294 --> 52:47.728
No offense intended.

52:48.496 --> 52:50.899
Yet somehow you always manage.

52:52.100 --> 52:53.834
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

52:53.968 --> 52:55.803
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

52:55.937 --> 53:00.840
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's
ever seen.

53:02.242 --> 53:03.576
Not even him.

53:05.145 --> 53:07.247
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

53:11.085 --> 53:12.852
What's that
supposed to mean?
Rooster.

53:12.986 --> 53:15.697
I can't be the only one
that knows that Maverick
flew with his old man.

53:15.721 --> 53:18.358
That's enough.
Or that Maverick was flying
when his old man...

53:18.492 --> 53:20.961
Lieutenant, that's enough!

53:21.095 --> 53:23.130
That's enough.
You son of a bitch!

53:23.263 --> 53:24.664
Hey, come on!

53:24.797 --> 53:26.500
I'm cool,
I'm cool. Hey, hey.

53:26.632 --> 53:28.936
- That's enough.
- He's not cut out for this mission.

53:29.069 --> 53:31.604
That's enough!
You know it.

53:34.274 --> 53:35.309
You know I'm right.

53:41.647 --> 53:42.983
You're all dismissed.

54:47.214 --> 54:48.748
Maverick.

54:50.783 --> 54:52.252
It's come back?

54:52.752 --> 54:54.354
No one knows.

54:56.256 --> 54:58.791
There's nothing else
they can do.

54:58.926 --> 55:02.162
Even speaking is painful now.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.937
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

55:29.455 --> 55:30.489
Admiral.

55:41.901 --> 55:43.302
How's my wingman?

55:54.813 --> 55:57.250
Please, don't worry about me.

55:57.984 --> 56:00.019
What can I do for you?

56:08.361 --> 56:09.462
All right.

56:12.098 --> 56:15.434
Well, rooster's still angry
with me about what I did.

56:16.602 --> 56:19.838
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

56:21.806 --> 56:23.775
I hoped he'd forgive me.

56:31.883 --> 56:33.753
The mission is less
than three weeks away.

56:33.885 --> 56:36.188
The kid's not ready.

56:44.230 --> 56:46.432
He doesn't want
what I have to give.

56:47.566 --> 56:48.768
Ice, please,

56:48.901 --> 56:51.037
don't ask me to send
someone else to die.

56:51.170 --> 56:52.505
Please don't...

56:53.272 --> 56:55.074
Don't ask me to send him.

56:55.207 --> 56:56.909
Send me.

57:28.506 --> 57:30.275
I don't know how.

57:43.221 --> 57:45.256
I'm not a teacher, ice.

57:47.559 --> 57:49.461
I'm a fighter pilot.

57:51.896 --> 57:53.465
A naval aviator.

57:55.834 --> 57:58.136
It's not what I am.

57:59.104 --> 58:01.005
It's who I am.

58:02.574 --> 58:04.409
How do I teach that?

58:05.876 --> 58:09.414
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what rooster wants.

58:09.547 --> 58:11.816
It's not what the Navy wants.

58:11.950 --> 58:14.452
That's why they canned me
the last time.

58:17.088 --> 58:20.291
The only reason I'm here is you.

58:27.332 --> 58:29.434
If I send him on this mission,

58:30.735 --> 58:32.670
he might never come home.

58:36.241 --> 58:38.576
And if I don't send him,

58:38.710 --> 58:40.612
he'll never forgive me.

58:43.148 --> 58:45.950
Either way,
I could lose him forever.

58:56.094 --> 58:57.328
I know.

58:57.962 --> 58:59.464
I know.

59:10.375 --> 59:14.312
The Navy needs Maverick.

59:16.114 --> 59:19.784
The kid needs Maverick.

59:20.618 --> 59:23.221
That's why I fought for you.

59:25.023 --> 59:27.525
That's why you're still here.

59:35.533 --> 59:37.068
Thank you, ice,

59:37.202 --> 59:39.437
for everything.

59:44.141 --> 59:45.642
One last thing.

59:45.776 --> 59:47.946
Who's the better pilot?

59:48.111 --> 59:49.546
You or me?

59:52.416 --> 59:55.018
This is a nice moment.

Offense and defense
at the same time.

01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:06.083
Who's winning?

01:02:06.215 --> 01:02:08.751
I think they stopped
keeping score a while ago.

01:02:08.884 --> 01:02:11.854

still has some training
to complete, captain.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:14.290

Yes, sir.

01:02:14.423 --> 01:02:16.525

playing games?

01:02:16.659 --> 01:02:18.794

She'll be at her
friend's house tonight.
Oh, good.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.240
You and Amelia, you seem...

01:04:13.608 --> 01:04:16.078
A lot closer
than when I last saw you.

01:04:16.212 --> 01:04:18.780
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
How do you manage?

01:04:20.882 --> 01:04:22.851
Well,

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:26.521
you know, she always wanted
more freedom than I thought
she was ready for.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:29.691
Hmm. Where'd she
get that from, I wonder?

01:04:33.162 --> 01:04:34.729
I guess I realized

01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:37.732
I also had to trust her.

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.337
Let her make some
of her own mistakes
sometimes.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:46.041
Not an easy choice.
Mmm.

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:52.413
Is that what happened
with rooster?

01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:58.753
I pulled his papers
from the naval academy.

01:05:01.556 --> 01:05:03.558
Took years off his career.

01:05:09.764 --> 01:05:10.799
Why?

01:05:13.301 --> 01:05:17.338
His mother never
wanted him to fly, not after
what happened to goose.

01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:23.212
She made me promise
before she died, so...

01:05:23.344 --> 01:05:25.513
Does rooster know that?

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.987
He will always resent me
for what I did.

01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:36.558
Why should he resent her too?

01:05:40.695 --> 01:05:43.032
Not an easy choice.
Hmm.

01:05:45.433 --> 01:05:48.070
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

01:05:51.106 --> 01:05:52.340
I just...

01:05:54.809 --> 01:05:57.378
I wish I would've
done it better.

01:05:59.347 --> 01:06:02.450
But the truth is...

01:06:04.652 --> 01:06:06.754
I didn't think he was ready.

01:06:10.192 --> 01:06:11.994
Is he ready now?

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.899
Mom, I'm home!

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:20.735
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

01:06:20.869 --> 01:06:23.605
Karen's sick.
And I've got homework to do.

01:06:23.738 --> 01:06:26.008
I should go.
You should go.

01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:29.543
Have you had dinner yet?
Not yet.
You wanna go out?

01:06:29.676 --> 01:06:32.546
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:34.514
I'll be down in a sec!

01:06:34.648 --> 01:06:36.850
Wait! Not that way.
What?

01:06:38.353 --> 01:06:40.454
Look, I have an example to set.

01:06:40.587 --> 01:06:43.091
I can't be
bringing guys home
on a first date.

01:06:43.224 --> 01:06:44.725
This is not our first date.

01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:47.494
You know what I mean.

01:06:50.064 --> 01:06:51.099
Okay.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.002
Fine.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.436
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:58.072
We'll see.

01:06:58.206 --> 01:07:00.208
No. No, I mean it.

01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:02.509
I'm never gonna leave you again.

01:07:04.279 --> 01:07:05.712
Oh, shut up.

01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:07.982
Go on, get out of here.

01:07:21.396 --> 01:07:23.597
Just don't
break her heart again.

01:07:34.943 --> 01:07:36.210
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.445
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

01:07:38.578 --> 01:07:40.881
will be operational
earlier than expected.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:44.818
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

01:07:44.953 --> 01:07:47.889
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.458
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley
with radiation.

01:07:51.591 --> 01:07:54.594
Sir, no one here
has successfully flown
a low-level course.

01:07:54.728 --> 01:07:56.898
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered
to move on.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.067
Captain.

01:08:01.868 --> 01:08:04.105
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

01:08:04.238 --> 01:08:06.107
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.976
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:11.478
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

01:08:12.447 --> 01:08:13.680
<i>Two pairs of f-18s will fly</i>

01:08:13.814 --> 01:08:15.283
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:19.187
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential</i>

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.023
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

01:08:22.156 --> 01:08:24.858
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

01:08:24.993 --> 01:08:29.930
On final approach,
you'll invert directly
into a steep dive.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.033
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:36.037
<i>and the only possible
attack angle.</i>

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:44.344
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

01:08:44.478 --> 01:08:46.479
<i>The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target</i>

01:08:46.612 --> 01:08:48.848
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>

01:08:48.982 --> 01:08:50.816
The first pair
will breach the reactor

01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:54.620
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

01:08:54.754 --> 01:08:57.656
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:59.591
That's miracle number one.

01:09:01.395 --> 01:09:04.430
<i>The second team
will deliver the kill shot...</i>

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:07.832
and destroy the target.

01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:10.303
That's miracle number two.

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:14.006
<i>If either team
misses the target...</i>

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:18.377
- That's a miss.
<i>- The mission is a failure.</i>

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:19.779
Damn it!

01:09:19.912 --> 01:09:22.381
Egress
is a steep high-g climb out

01:09:22.515 --> 01:09:24.184
to avoid hitting this mountain.

01:09:26.286 --> 01:09:29.654
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling
at least eight g's.

01:09:29.788 --> 01:09:31.124
Nine, minimum.

01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:33.960
The stress limit
of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

01:09:34.094 --> 01:09:35.627
That's the accepted limit.

01:09:35.761 --> 01:09:37.830
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

01:09:37.964 --> 01:09:40.901
even if it means
bending your airframe.

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:45.205
<i>You'll be pulling so hard,</i>
<i>you'll weigh close</i>
<i>to 2,000 pounds,</i>

01:09:45.337 --> 01:09:47.974
<i>your skull</i>
<i>crushing your spine...</i>

01:09:48.108 --> 01:09:51.310
<i>your lungs imploding</i>
<i>like an elephant's sitting</i>
<i>on your chest,</i>

01:09:51.444 --> 01:09:55.115
<i>fighting with everything</i>
<i>you have just to keep</i>
<i>from blacking out.</i>

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.886
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

01:10:00.619 --> 01:10:03.256
This is coffin corner.

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.926
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:09.862
you'll climb straight up
into enemy radar while losing
all of your airspeed.

01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:13.333
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon
by enemy sams.

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:17.337
You've all faced
sustained g's before,
but this...

01:10:17.471 --> 01:10:21.341
This is gonna
take you and your aircraft
to the breaking point.

01:10:21.475 --> 01:10:24.211
Sir, is this even achievable?

01:10:24.344 --> 01:10:26.213
The answer to that question

01:10:26.346 --> 01:10:28.881
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:40.427
Talk to me, Bob.
We are 12 seconds
late on target.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.463
We gotta move!
We gotta move!
Copy. Try to stay with me.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.935
Huh? Wait, who's that?

01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:51.414
<i>Blue team,</i>
<i>you've been spotted.</i>

01:10:51.438 --> 01:10:53.739
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

01:10:53.873 --> 01:10:57.144
I'm a bandit on course
to intercept. Blue team,
what are you gonna do?

01:10:57.277 --> 01:11:00.546
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

01:11:00.678 --> 01:11:02.281
Your call.
What do you want to do?

01:11:02.414 --> 01:11:05.117
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:08.354
He's swinging around
to the north!
Stand by for pop-up.

01:11:08.487 --> 01:11:11.689
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.659
Blue team,
bandit is still closing.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.860
Popping now.

01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:24.103
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:26.704
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

01:11:32.178 --> 01:11:35.314
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

01:11:35.447 --> 01:11:38.884
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:41.120
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:45.857
Damn it, missed!

01:11:56.402 --> 01:11:58.170
That's tone.

01:11:58.304 --> 01:12:00.738
Maverick's got
missile lock on us.
Shit! We're dead.

01:12:01.507 --> 01:12:02.908
Blue team, that's a fail.

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:04.243
Level out, coyote.

01:12:06.744 --> 01:12:08.914
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:13.485
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

01:12:13.619 --> 01:12:15.487
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

01:12:15.621 --> 01:12:17.022
Oh, god. He's in g-loc.

01:12:17.156 --> 01:12:20.259
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

01:12:20.392 --> 01:12:22.995
He's gonna burn in!
I'm going after him.

01:12:25.931 --> 01:12:28.334
Come on. Give me tone,
give me tone, give me tone.

01:12:28.467 --> 01:12:31.971
Snap out of it, coyote.
Come on! Come on!

01:12:34.772 --> 01:12:37.343
Come on, coyote, come on.
Come on!

01:12:37.476 --> 01:12:39.511
<i>- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote!</i>
<i>- Pull up!</i>

01:12:39.645 --> 01:12:42.780
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!</i>
<i>- Pull up! Pull up!</i>

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.288
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

01:12:49.421 --> 01:12:52.424
I'm okay. I'm good.

01:12:53.192 --> 01:12:56.295
Good. Good.
That's enough for today.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:59.531
That was close.

01:12:59.665 --> 01:13:01.200
Too close.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.969
Bird strike! Bird strike!

01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:06.071
Bird strike!

01:13:08.474 --> 01:13:11.443
Phoenix,
left engine's on fire!
Climbing.

01:13:13.212 --> 01:13:15.747
Throttling back.
Shutting off fuel
to left engine.

01:13:15.879 --> 01:13:17.814
Extinguishing fire.

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:20.817
Right engine is out!

01:13:20.952 --> 01:13:22.620
It's still spinning.
Trying to restart it.

01:13:25.089 --> 01:13:26.090
Phoenix, it's on fire.

01:13:26.224 --> 01:13:28.026
Don't start... throttling up.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.895
Oh, my god.

01:13:33.965 --> 01:13:36.234
We're on fire! We're on fire!
Damn it!

01:13:36.367 --> 01:13:39.404
<i>Engine fire. Right.</i>
Extinguishing right engine.

01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:44.309
Phoenix, Bob,
punch out, punch out!

01:13:44.442 --> 01:13:46.511
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

01:13:46.644 --> 01:13:48.613
<i>Flight controls.</i>
I can't control it.

01:13:48.746 --> 01:13:51.266
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

01:13:51.349 --> 01:13:53.985
You can't save it.
Eject, eject!

01:13:54.118 --> 01:13:55.286
Eject, eject, eject!

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.423
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.747
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight
for observation.

01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:24.515
They're gonna be okay.

01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:30.054
That's good.

01:14:33.157 --> 01:14:35.126
I've never lost a wingman.

01:14:35.693 --> 01:14:37.261
You're lucky.

01:14:37.395 --> 01:14:39.430
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

01:14:42.033 --> 01:14:44.001
There will be others.

01:14:46.371 --> 01:14:48.606
Easy for you to say.
No wife.

01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.310
No kids.

01:14:52.443 --> 01:14:55.213
Nobody to mourn you
when you burn in.

01:14:58.383 --> 01:14:59.884
Go home.

01:15:00.752 --> 01:15:02.353
Just get some sleep.

01:15:04.555 --> 01:15:06.858
Why'd you pull my papers
at the academy?

01:15:06.991 --> 01:15:08.926
Why did you stand in my way?

01:15:11.162 --> 01:15:12.563
You weren't ready.

01:15:12.697 --> 01:15:14.165
Ready for what?

01:15:14.999 --> 01:15:17.235
Huh?
Ready to fly like you?
No.

01:15:17.368 --> 01:15:19.003
Ready to forget the book.

01:15:19.137 --> 01:15:21.639
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

01:15:21.773 --> 01:15:24.942
You think up there,
you're dead. Believe me.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:27.912
My dad believed in you.

01:15:30.247 --> 01:15:33.049
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

01:15:38.555 --> 01:15:40.190
Maverick.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.537
Ready, aim, fire.

01:15:58.308 --> 01:15:59.476
Ready,

01:15:59.876 --> 01:16:01.178
aim,

01:16:01.311 --> 01:16:03.013
fire.

01:16:12.823 --> 01:16:14.224
Ready,

01:16:15.025 --> 01:16:16.460
aim,

01:16:16.593 --> 01:16:18.061
fire.

01:16:51.461 --> 01:16:54.531
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling
right now.

01:16:54.664 --> 01:16:57.935
Take some time.
Whatever you need.

01:16:58.068 --> 01:17:00.504
I appreciate that, sir,
but there is no time.
The mission...

01:17:00.637 --> 01:17:03.139
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

01:17:03.908 --> 01:17:05.108
Sir?

01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:07.921
We both know you didn't
want this job, captain.

01:17:07.945 --> 01:17:10.347
Sir, they're not ready.
It was your job
to get them ready.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.783
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

01:17:13.918 --> 01:17:17.153
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

01:17:17.955 --> 01:17:19.991
Sir... you're grounded, captain.

01:17:20.123 --> 01:17:21.758
Permanently.

01:17:25.428 --> 01:17:27.264
Sir... that is all.

01:17:45.481 --> 01:17:46.515
I heard.

01:17:48.717 --> 01:17:50.085
I'm sorry.

01:17:50.786 --> 01:17:52.521
What are you gonna do?

01:17:53.622 --> 01:17:55.090
Ice is gone.

01:17:57.293 --> 01:17:59.295
What choice do I have?

01:18:00.296 --> 01:18:02.831
You'll have to
find a way back
on your own.

01:18:02.966 --> 01:18:04.400
No, penny.

01:18:06.002 --> 01:18:07.503
I'm out.

01:18:09.071 --> 01:18:10.506
This is over.

01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:11.975
Pete.

01:18:12.107 --> 01:18:14.476
If you lost
your wingman up there,

01:18:15.144 --> 01:18:16.845
you'd keep fighting.

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.414
You wouldn't just give up.

01:18:19.049 --> 01:18:21.250
Those are your pilots.

01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:25.055
If anything happens to them,

01:18:25.187 --> 01:18:27.523
you'll never forgive yourself.

01:18:31.327 --> 01:18:33.462
I don't know what to do.

01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:39.134
But you'll find a way.

01:18:41.236 --> 01:18:42.638
I know you will.

01:18:44.573 --> 01:18:46.775
<i>Captain Mitchell</i>
<i>is no longer your instructor.</i>

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:50.112
And as of today,
there are new
mission parameters.

01:18:50.245 --> 01:18:52.615
Time to target
is now four minutes.

01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:55.317
You'll be entering
the valley level
at reduced speed.

01:18:55.451 --> 01:18:58.153
Not to exceed 420 knots.

01:18:58.287 --> 01:19:00.991
Sir, won't we be
giving their planes
time to intercept?

01:19:01.123 --> 01:19:03.763
Well, lieutenant,
you have a fighting chance
against enemy aircraft.

01:19:03.859 --> 01:19:06.862
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision
with a mountain?

01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:09.732
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:11.200
level with the north wall.

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:13.435
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

01:19:13.569 --> 01:19:15.437
but you will avoid
the high-g climb out.

01:19:15.571 --> 01:19:18.173
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

01:19:23.278 --> 01:19:24.680
Who the hell is that?

01:19:26.116 --> 01:19:29.119
<i>Maverick to range control.</i>
<i>Entering point Alpha.</i>

01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:31.186
Confirm green range.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.457
<i>Uh, Maverick, range control,</i>
<i>uh, green range is confirmed.</i>

01:19:35.591 --> 01:19:38.827
<i>I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.</i>

01:19:38.962 --> 01:19:40.930
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

01:19:41.064 --> 01:19:42.197
Nice.

01:19:42.331 --> 01:19:44.100
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

01:19:44.233 --> 01:19:46.036
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

01:19:46.168 --> 01:19:47.703
2:15? That's impossible.

01:19:47.836 --> 01:19:50.706
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

01:21:28.237 --> 01:21:31.639
Popping in three, two, one.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.234
Bombs away.

01:22:16.918 --> 01:22:19.519
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

01:22:20.054 --> 01:22:21.755
Yes.

01:22:24.424 --> 01:22:25.458
Damn.

01:22:38.172 --> 01:22:41.108
You have put me
in a difficult position,
captain.

01:22:41.242 --> 01:22:44.979
On the one hand,
you have demonstrated that
this mission can be flown.

01:22:45.112 --> 01:22:47.781
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:50.284
On the other hand,

01:22:50.417 --> 01:22:53.221
you did it by stealing
a multimillion-dollar
military aircraft

01:22:53.353 --> 01:22:56.690
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never
be airworthy again.

01:22:57.791 --> 01:23:00.760
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

01:23:00.895 --> 01:23:03.530
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

01:23:03.663 --> 01:23:05.699
and dishonorably discharged.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.834
So what do I do?

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:09.769
Risk the lives of my pilots

01:23:09.904 --> 01:23:11.939
and perhaps the success
of this mission

01:23:13.307 --> 01:23:14.541
or...

01:23:15.943 --> 01:23:17.544
Risk my career

01:23:18.378 --> 01:23:20.413
by appointing you team leader?

01:23:23.717 --> 01:23:28.455
Sir...
I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, captain.

01:25:09.122 --> 01:25:10.823
Talk to me, goose.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:15.694
Captain Mitchell!

01:25:22.435 --> 01:25:24.204
You're where you belong.

01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:30.743
Make us proud.

01:25:56.602 --> 01:25:58.938
It has been an honor
flying with you.

01:25:59.939 --> 01:26:03.842
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

01:26:03.977 --> 01:26:07.280
This is a very specific mission.

01:26:07.414 --> 01:26:10.783
My choice
is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:13.019
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

01:26:14.454 --> 01:26:16.189
Payback and fanboy.

01:26:17.223 --> 01:26:18.724
Phoenix and Bob.

01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:24.730
And your wingman.

01:26:29.002 --> 01:26:30.036
Rooster.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.608
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

01:26:36.742 --> 01:26:39.879
for any reserve role
that's required.

01:26:40.547 --> 01:26:41.915
Dismissed.

01:26:49.321 --> 01:26:52.424
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:57.595
<i>A secret uranium</i>
<i>enrichment site</i>
<i>under rogue state control.</i>

01:26:57.728 --> 01:26:59.597
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:01.799
tucked between
these two mountains.

01:27:03.335 --> 01:27:06.704
<i>Your route of ingress</i>
<i>is heavily defended</i>
<i>by surface-to-air missiles</i>

01:27:06.838 --> 01:27:09.174
<i>backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:12.044
Once your f-18 strike team
crosses the border,

01:27:12.177 --> 01:27:14.113
tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

01:27:14.246 --> 01:27:18.150
will launch
a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

01:27:19.184 --> 01:27:21.752
<i>This will knock out
their runway.</i>

01:27:23.188 --> 01:27:26.425
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

01:27:26.558 --> 01:27:29.861
The moment those tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know
you're coming.

01:27:30.795 --> 01:27:31.997
Your time to target

01:27:32.131 --> 01:27:35.067
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

01:27:36.368 --> 01:27:38.303
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

01:27:38.437 --> 01:27:41.373
<i>to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed.</i>

01:27:44.443 --> 01:27:47.212
This is what you've all
been training for.

01:27:48.947 --> 01:27:50.781
Come home safely.

01:28:05.297 --> 01:28:07.132
You give 'em hell!

01:28:19.611 --> 01:28:20.845
Sir.

01:28:21.246 --> 01:28:22.247
Sir?

01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:25.450
I...

01:28:28.153 --> 01:28:30.088
I just want to say...

01:28:38.997 --> 01:28:40.432
We'll talk

01:28:41.799 --> 01:28:43.335
when we get back.

01:28:49.374 --> 01:28:51.243
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:53.345
Hey.

01:28:56.714 --> 01:28:58.283
You got this.

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:07.824
<i>Maverick.</i>

01:29:10.294 --> 01:29:11.362
Maverick?

01:29:12.630 --> 01:29:14.798
Hey, you with me?

01:29:16.033 --> 01:29:18.135
I don't like that look, mav.

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:22.406
It's the only one I got.

01:29:26.877 --> 01:29:28.379
Thank you.

01:29:29.746 --> 01:29:31.748
If I don't see you again, hondo,

01:29:31.882 --> 01:29:33.384
thank you.

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:43.060
It's been an honor, captain.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.929
Dagger one,
up and ready on catapult one.

01:30:19.063 --> 01:30:21.098
Dagger spare standing by.

01:30:21.232 --> 01:30:23.000
Dagger four, up and ready.

01:30:23.134 --> 01:30:24.669
Dagger three, up and ready.

01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:27.138
Dagger two, up and ready.

01:30:28.005 --> 01:30:29.516
Support assets airborne.

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:30.708
Strike package ready.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.311
Standing by for launch decision.

01:30:33.444 --> 01:30:34.478
Send them.

01:30:54.965 --> 01:30:56.434
Dagger two away.

01:30:57.401 --> 01:30:59.303
Dagger three away.

01:30:59.437 --> 01:31:01.405
Dagger four away.

01:31:12.183 --> 01:31:14.952
Comanche, dagger one.
Standby check in.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.320
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

01:31:17.454 --> 01:31:19.789
Picture clean.
Recommend dagger continue.

01:31:19.923 --> 01:31:22.125
Copy. Daggers descending
below radar.

01:31:41.678 --> 01:31:44.581
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to e-2 picture.

01:31:52.956 --> 01:31:55.358
Here we go.
Enemy territory up ahead.

01:31:55.492 --> 01:31:58.395
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, dagger one. Picture.

01:31:58.528 --> 01:32:01.498
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

01:32:01.631 --> 01:32:03.099
Copy.

01:32:11.107 --> 01:32:12.442
Dagger attack.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.815
Tomahawks airborne.

01:32:18.948 --> 01:32:21.251
No turning back now.

01:32:26.823 --> 01:32:29.092
Daggers,
assume attack formation.

01:32:37.734 --> 01:32:39.669
<i>Daggers set.
Proceeding to target.</i>

01:32:39.803 --> 01:32:44.541
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, Mark.

01:32:44.674 --> 01:32:45.876
Two Mark.
Three Mark.

01:32:46.009 --> 01:32:47.143
Four Mark.

01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:53.049
Going in.

01:33:08.331 --> 01:33:10.733
First Sam site overhead.

01:33:15.004 --> 01:33:16.444
Looks like we're clear
on radar, mav.

01:33:16.473 --> 01:33:18.508
Let's not take it for granted.

01:33:21.879 --> 01:33:23.980
More sams! Three o'clock high!

01:33:26.316 --> 01:33:28.551
- We got two minutes to target.
<i>- Copy.</i>

01:33:28.685 --> 01:33:31.688
We're a few seconds
behind, rooster.
We got to move.

01:33:31.821 --> 01:33:35.724
Thirty seconds to tomahawk
impact on enemy airstrip.

01:33:43.131 --> 01:33:44.733
Dagger, comanche.

01:33:44.867 --> 01:33:47.078
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

01:33:47.102 --> 01:33:50.305
Where the hell'd
they come from?
Long-range patrol?

01:33:55.077 --> 01:33:56.612
Comanche, what's their heading?

01:33:56.745 --> 01:33:58.847
<i>Bull's-eye 090, 50,</i>
<i>tacked southwest.</i>

01:33:58.982 --> 01:34:01.183
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

01:34:01.316 --> 01:34:03.218
The second those tomahawks
hit the air base,

01:34:03.352 --> 01:34:05.420
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

01:34:05.554 --> 01:34:08.457
We have to get there
before they do.
Increase speed.

01:34:09.525 --> 01:34:12.194
We got you, mav.
Don't wait for me.

01:34:17.733 --> 01:34:20.869
Sir, daggers two and four
are behind schedule.

01:34:21.004 --> 01:34:23.338
Time to target, one minute 20.

01:34:23.472 --> 01:34:26.542
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

01:34:30.612 --> 01:34:33.415
Impact.
Enemy runway is destroyed.

01:34:34.082 --> 01:34:35.784
They know we're coming now.

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:41.256
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:42.724
Rooster, where are you?

01:34:44.259 --> 01:34:45.905
<i>Come on, rooster.</i>
<i>Bandits inbound.</i>

01:34:45.929 --> 01:34:48.497
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

01:34:56.238 --> 01:34:57.506
Heads up, Phoenix.

01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:02.444
Whoa!

01:35:06.916 --> 01:35:09.851
Sir, bandits are two minutes
from target.

01:35:09.986 --> 01:35:11.353
Daggers are one minute
from target.

01:35:11.486 --> 01:35:14.156
Come on, rooster.
Move it or lose it.

01:35:15.925 --> 01:35:18.727
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.729
If we don't increase our speed
right now,

01:35:20.862 --> 01:35:23.832
those bandits
are gonna be waiting for us
when we reach the target.

01:35:25.634 --> 01:35:26.835
Talk to me, dad.

01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:29.404
Come on, kid, you can do it.

01:35:29.538 --> 01:35:31.807
Don't think, just do.

01:35:40.182 --> 01:35:41.683
Jesus, rooster, not that fast!

01:35:41.817 --> 01:35:44.486
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

01:35:48.322 --> 01:35:49.857
Damn, rooster, take it easy.

01:35:49.992 --> 01:35:53.294
Sir, dagger two is reengaging.

01:35:53.427 --> 01:35:56.163
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

01:36:00.267 --> 01:36:02.770
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

01:36:02.904 --> 01:36:06.641
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

01:36:06.774 --> 01:36:07.876
<i>Laser is a go!</i>

01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:11.646
Watch your heads.

01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:14.515
Holy shit! Shit!

01:36:14.649 --> 01:36:16.784
Payback, you with me?
Right behind you.

01:36:17.652 --> 01:36:19.453
Phoenix, stand by
for pop-up strike.

01:36:19.587 --> 01:36:21.255
Dagger three in position.

01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:24.558
Popping in three, two, one.

01:36:52.353 --> 01:36:54.789
Get me eyes
on that target, Bob.
Dagger three.

01:36:55.856 --> 01:36:57.658
<i>Stand by, mav.</i>
Come on, Bob, come on.

01:36:57.792 --> 01:36:59.627
Stand by.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.797
I've got it. Captured!
Target acquired. Bombs away.

01:37:23.617 --> 01:37:27.055
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:28.990
That's miracle number one.

01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:31.059
Dagger two, status.

01:37:31.193 --> 01:37:32.827
Almost there, mav. Almost there.

01:37:35.329 --> 01:37:36.731
Fanboy, where's my laser?

01:37:36.864 --> 01:37:39.533
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

01:37:39.667 --> 01:37:41.169
Shit! Deadeye, deadeye, deadeye!

01:37:41.302 --> 01:37:43.604
Come on, guys,
we're running out of time.
Get it online!

01:37:43.738 --> 01:37:45.239
<i>I'm trying!</i>
<i>Come on, fanboy!</i>

01:37:45.372 --> 01:37:47.341
Nearly there! Nearly there!

01:37:56.184 --> 01:37:58.528
Come on, fanboy, get it online.
There's no time.
I'm dropping blind.

01:37:58.552 --> 01:38:00.654
Rooster, I got this!
No time. Pull up.

01:38:00.788 --> 01:38:02.957
- Wait!
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

01:38:15.535 --> 01:38:17.837
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye,
bull's-eye!

01:38:21.574 --> 01:38:22.742
Miracle number two.

01:38:22.877 --> 01:38:24.511
Now they're in coffin corner.

01:38:24.644 --> 01:38:26.947
We're not out of this yet.

01:38:28.782 --> 01:38:30.350
Here it comes.

01:38:32.953 --> 01:38:35.222
Radar warning!
Smoke in the air.
Phoenix, break right.

01:38:35.355 --> 01:38:37.524
Emergency jettison.
Dagger three defending.

01:38:37.657 --> 01:38:39.425
Here comes another one!

01:38:39.559 --> 01:38:41.528
Dagger one defending.

01:38:47.534 --> 01:38:48.835
Rooster, status.

01:38:56.977 --> 01:38:58.012
Oh, my god.

01:38:59.947 --> 01:39:01.714
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air!

01:39:02.782 --> 01:39:04.919
Break right, payback!
Breaking right.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.022
Oh, my god,
here they come!

01:39:08.155 --> 01:39:09.689
Sam on your six, rooster!

01:39:11.025 --> 01:39:12.559
Deploying countermeasures.

01:39:15.196 --> 01:39:16.830
Negative contact.

01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:19.934
Dagger one defending.

01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:23.871
Talk to me, Bob.
Break right, Phoenix!
Break right! Mav!

01:39:24.004 --> 01:39:25.839
<i>Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!</i>

01:39:26.874 --> 01:39:28.374
<i>Rooster, two more on your six.</i>

01:39:28.508 --> 01:39:30.110
Dagger two, defending.

01:39:34.547 --> 01:39:36.749
Payback, Sam on your nose.
Dagger four defending.

01:39:36.884 --> 01:39:38.594
Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
Talk to me, Bob!

01:39:38.618 --> 01:39:39.898
On our six!
Dagger two defending.

01:39:39.987 --> 01:39:41.621
- Phoenix, break right!
<i>- I see it!</i>

01:39:49.196 --> 01:39:50.730
Dagger two defending.

01:39:51.798 --> 01:39:53.067
Shit, I'm out of flares!

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.202
Rooster, evade, evade!

01:39:55.336 --> 01:39:57.972
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

01:40:08.048 --> 01:40:09.782
Mav! No!

01:40:11.551 --> 01:40:15.089
Dagger one is hit!
I repeat, dagger one is hit!

01:40:15.222 --> 01:40:16.556
<i>Maverick is down.</i>

01:40:16.689 --> 01:40:17.958
<i>Dagger one, status.</i>

01:40:18.092 --> 01:40:19.524
<i>Status!</i>

01:40:19.658 --> 01:40:21.693
<i>Anyone see him?
Does anyone see him?</i>

01:40:21.827 --> 01:40:24.163
Dagger one, come in!
I didn't see a parachute.

01:40:24.297 --> 01:40:25.731
We have to circle back.

01:40:25.864 --> 01:40:28.400
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

01:40:28.533 --> 01:40:30.169
Recommend dagger flow south.

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.039
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

01:40:36.009 --> 01:40:39.178
Get 'em back
to the carrier now.
All daggers flow to ecp.

01:40:39.312 --> 01:40:41.352
<i>You have bandits</i>
<i>headed for you.</i>
What about Maverick?

01:40:41.446 --> 01:40:44.250
Tell him there's nothing
he can do for Maverick,
not in a goddamn f-18.

01:40:44.384 --> 01:40:47.686
Dagger spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

01:40:49.688 --> 01:40:51.024
Negative, spare.

01:40:51.823 --> 01:40:52.926
Launch search and rescue.

01:40:53.059 --> 01:40:54.502
Negative.
Not with bandits in the air.

01:40:54.526 --> 01:40:55.871
But, sir,
Maverick is still out there.

01:40:55.895 --> 01:40:58.197
We are not losing
anyone else today.

01:41:00.133 --> 01:41:01.466
Get 'em home now.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.170
Dagger, you are not to engage.

01:41:04.304 --> 01:41:06.105
Repeat, do not engage.

01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:09.441
<i>Dagger two, return to carrier.</i>
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

01:41:09.574 --> 01:41:10.609
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

01:41:10.742 --> 01:41:12.979
Rooster,
those bandits are closing.

01:41:13.112 --> 01:41:14.147
We can't go back.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.216
Rooster, he's gone.

01:41:18.717 --> 01:41:20.552
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

01:42:50.708 --> 01:42:51.943
Oh, no, no.

01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:00.118
<i>Dagger two is hit.</i>

01:43:01.219 --> 01:43:02.320
Dagger two is hit.

01:43:03.754 --> 01:43:05.623
Dagger two, come in.

01:43:06.824 --> 01:43:08.894
Dagger two, do you copy?

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.897
<i>Dagger two, come in.</i>

01:43:37.089 --> 01:43:38.089
You all right?

01:43:38.123 --> 01:43:40.025
Yeah, I'm good.
You all right?

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:44.463
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

01:43:44.595 --> 01:43:46.797
What am I doing here?
You think I took
that missile

01:43:46.932 --> 01:43:48.467
so you could be
down here with me?

01:43:48.599 --> 01:43:50.335
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

01:43:50.469 --> 01:43:51.970
I saved your life!

01:43:52.104 --> 01:43:55.140
I saved your life.
That's the whole point.

01:43:55.273 --> 01:43:57.242
What the hell
were you even thinking?

01:43:57.375 --> 01:43:59.677
You told me not to think!

01:44:16.194 --> 01:44:17.295
Well,

01:44:18.729 --> 01:44:20.065
it's good to see you.

01:44:22.534 --> 01:44:24.136
It's good to see you too.

01:44:27.906 --> 01:44:29.707
So what's the plan?

01:44:40.585 --> 01:44:41.987
You're not serious.

01:44:57.001 --> 01:44:59.103
You've got to be
shitting me.

01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:02.540
An f-14?

01:45:02.672 --> 01:45:04.241
I shot down three migs
in one of those.

01:45:04.375 --> 01:45:07.144
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

01:45:09.679 --> 01:45:11.882
Let's find out.
Mav!

01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:14.784
Okay.

01:45:23.994 --> 01:45:27.097
There's guys up there, mav.
Yeah.

01:45:27.231 --> 01:45:30.201
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

01:45:30.334 --> 01:45:32.937
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

01:45:42.079 --> 01:45:45.015
Once... once I give you
the signal for air,

01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:47.784
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

01:45:47.918 --> 01:45:49.286
When the engine starts,

01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:51.721
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

01:45:51.854 --> 01:45:53.524
You understand?
Yeah.

01:45:55.725 --> 01:45:56.961
Yes!

01:45:58.629 --> 01:46:00.998
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

01:46:08.706 --> 01:46:10.975
Okay. Wow.

01:46:11.875 --> 01:46:13.978
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

01:46:42.439 --> 01:46:45.842
Oh, my god.
This thing is so old.

01:46:46.610 --> 01:46:47.844
All right.

01:46:52.683 --> 01:46:54.351
Canopy?
Clear.

01:47:12.502 --> 01:47:14.836
Both runways are cratered.

01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:17.273
How we gonna get
this museum piece
in the air?

01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:29.118
Why are the wings
coming out, mav?

01:47:35.425 --> 01:47:38.127
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

01:47:38.261 --> 01:47:41.731
This is a very short
taxiway, mav.

01:47:41.863 --> 01:47:43.266
Just hang on.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.035
Holy shit!

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.009
Come on, come on, come on.

01:47:53.142 --> 01:47:55.078
Needle's alive. Come on.

01:47:57.513 --> 01:47:59.848
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

01:47:59.982 --> 01:48:01.250
All right.

01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:04.187
Mav!
Here we go.

01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:07.090
Holy shit.

01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:23.673
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from rooster's esat.

01:48:23.806 --> 01:48:25.675
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

01:48:25.808 --> 01:48:27.310
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

01:48:28.211 --> 01:48:29.645
He's supersonic.

01:48:30.179 --> 01:48:31.447
He's airborne.

01:48:32.615 --> 01:48:34.517
In what?
Sir.

01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:39.255
Overwatch reports
an f-14 tomcat is airborne
and on course for our position.

01:48:39.989 --> 01:48:42.658
Can't be. It can't be!

01:48:44.394 --> 01:48:45.428
Maverick.

01:48:47.397 --> 01:48:49.799
Okay, rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

01:48:49.932 --> 01:48:51.401
I'm working on it.

01:48:51.534 --> 01:48:54.637
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:57.875
What do I do?
Talk me through it.
Okay, first the radio.

01:48:58.007 --> 01:48:59.877
Throw the, uh...

01:49:00.009 --> 01:49:03.179
The uhf-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

01:49:03.312 --> 01:49:06.215
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

01:49:06.349 --> 01:49:08.451
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

01:49:08.584 --> 01:49:10.186
I'll figure it out.

01:49:13.222 --> 01:49:15.591
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

01:49:20.829 --> 01:49:22.164
What do we do?

01:49:22.831 --> 01:49:24.699
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

01:49:24.833 --> 01:49:27.502
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:31.006
Well, here they come.

01:49:31.139 --> 01:49:34.443
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

01:49:35.410 --> 01:49:38.113
Remember,
we're on the same team.

01:49:40.649 --> 01:49:42.517
Just wave and smile.

01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:44.719
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

01:49:51.593 --> 01:49:53.361
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

01:49:53.495 --> 01:49:56.965
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

01:49:57.098 --> 01:50:01.036
What about that one? Any idea?
No, never seen that one either.

01:50:03.873 --> 01:50:08.143
Oh, shit. His wingman is moving
into weapons envelope.

01:50:08.777 --> 01:50:10.278
All right, listen up.

01:50:10.412 --> 01:50:12.981
When I tell you,
you grab those rings
above your head.

01:50:13.114 --> 01:50:14.783
That's the ejection handle.

01:50:15.717 --> 01:50:18.186
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

01:50:18.921 --> 01:50:21.056
Not their missiles and guns.

01:50:25.293 --> 01:50:27.229
Then it's a dogfight.

01:50:27.362 --> 01:50:30.465
An f-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:34.269
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

01:50:35.504 --> 01:50:37.672
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.175
But you are here.

01:50:40.775 --> 01:50:42.277
Come on, mav.

01:50:43.178 --> 01:50:44.546
Don't think.

01:50:45.714 --> 01:50:46.781
Just do.

01:51:02.264 --> 01:51:04.466
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

01:51:08.537 --> 01:51:11.039
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air!
Hang on.

01:51:13.475 --> 01:51:16.311
Yeah, mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

01:51:21.349 --> 01:51:23.418
Here comes another one.

01:51:25.922 --> 01:51:28.189
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

01:51:31.293 --> 01:51:32.727
Splitting the throttles.

01:51:34.828 --> 01:51:36.163
Coming around.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.913
Give me tone, give me tone.

01:51:41.937 --> 01:51:44.538
You got him, mav!
You got him!
Taking the shot.

01:51:50.511 --> 01:51:51.745
What the...

01:51:52.513 --> 01:51:54.848
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

01:51:56.150 --> 01:51:58.285
Hang on. We gotta get low.

01:51:58.419 --> 01:52:01.088
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

01:52:02.958 --> 01:52:04.124
Here he comes!

01:52:16.537 --> 01:52:18.405
Talk to me, rooster.
Where is he?

01:52:18.539 --> 01:52:20.507
He's still on us!

01:52:27.414 --> 01:52:29.717
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

01:52:34.555 --> 01:52:37.025
Come on, mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.
Brace yourself.

01:52:47.668 --> 01:52:48.736
Holy shit.

01:52:55.542 --> 01:52:57.645
I got tone. Taking the shot.

01:53:01.983 --> 01:53:03.417
Damn it!

01:53:04.184 --> 01:53:07.187
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:14.194
Come on, mav, come on.

01:53:16.497 --> 01:53:18.432
You got him, mav!
It's not over yet.

01:53:22.770 --> 01:53:24.873
One last chance.
You can do this.

01:53:25.974 --> 01:53:27.876
Come on, Maverick.

01:53:37.217 --> 01:53:39.386
Yes! Splash two!

01:53:50.196 --> 01:53:51.865
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

01:53:51.999 --> 01:53:54.068
Get us in touch
with the boat.
Copy that.

01:53:56.335 --> 01:53:57.737
Oh, my god.

01:53:59.505 --> 01:54:01.474
Where the hell is this guy?

01:54:02.508 --> 01:54:04.410
He's on our nose.

01:54:06.779 --> 01:54:08.916
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

01:54:10.783 --> 01:54:13.486
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

01:54:15.889 --> 01:54:17.356
That was close.

01:54:19.492 --> 01:54:21.661
We're out of flares, mav.

01:54:25.598 --> 01:54:27.800
Shit, he's already on us.

01:54:32.039 --> 01:54:34.440
This is not good.

01:54:42.348 --> 01:54:44.550
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

01:54:49.156 --> 01:54:51.324
We can't take much more of this.

01:54:51.457 --> 01:54:53.193
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

01:54:53.326 --> 01:54:54.594
What?
We need altitude.

01:54:54.727 --> 01:54:56.729
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

01:54:56.864 --> 01:54:59.032
Mav, wait!
Rooster,
there's no other way.

01:55:02.202 --> 01:55:03.603
Eject, eject, eject!

01:55:03.736 --> 01:55:06.506
Rooster, pull the handle!
Eject!

01:55:06.639 --> 01:55:08.541
It's not working!

01:55:18.384 --> 01:55:21.621
Mav!

01:55:22.588 --> 01:55:24.290
I'm sorry.

01:55:25.458 --> 01:55:27.293
I'm sorry, goose.

01:55:39.639 --> 01:55:41.440
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:41.574 --> 01:55:43.576
This is your savior speaking.

01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:45.511
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

01:55:45.645 --> 01:55:48.182
<i>return your tray tables</i>
<i>to their locked</i>
<i>and upright positions...</i>

01:55:49.415 --> 01:55:51.851
<i>and prepare for landing.</i>

01:55:54.087 --> 01:55:56.223
Hey, hangman, you look good.

01:55:56.355 --> 01:55:59.859
I am good, rooster.
I'm very good.

01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:03.529
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

01:56:25.017 --> 01:56:27.619
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

01:56:27.752 --> 01:56:29.956
No tailhook.
Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

01:56:30.089 --> 01:56:32.591
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

01:56:33.425 --> 01:56:34.961
Go!

01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:59.384
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

01:56:59.517 --> 01:57:02.454
All right,
I won't tell you that.
Okay.

01:57:26.379 --> 01:57:27.445
You good?

01:57:27.579 --> 01:57:29.547
Yeah. I'm good.

01:58:14.859 --> 01:58:17.696
Chalked yourself
another kill.
That makes two.

01:58:18.264 --> 01:58:19.464
Mav has five.

01:58:19.597 --> 01:58:21.132
Makes him an ace.

01:58:39.084 --> 01:58:41.652
Captain Mitchell!
Captain Mitchell!

01:58:48.293 --> 01:58:49.727
Sir.

01:58:56.968 --> 01:58:58.903
Thank you for saving my life.

01:59:00.005 --> 01:59:02.140
It's what my dad would've done.

01:59:41.312 --> 01:59:42.546
Hey, mav.

01:59:43.381 --> 01:59:44.681
Jimmy.

01:59:45.616 --> 01:59:46.850
Is, uh...

01:59:47.551 --> 01:59:48.887
Is penny around?

01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:52.656
Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

01:59:54.893 --> 01:59:57.028
Did she say when she'd be back?

01:59:57.162 --> 01:59:58.997
You know, she didn't.

02:00:01.232 --> 02:00:03.001
Can I get you anything?

02:00:16.247 --> 02:00:17.282
Get in there.
