WEBVTT

00:28.111 --> 00:32.448
Danny! Danny! Fucking shoot him!

00:33.075 --> 00:34.159
Sir?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.621
Could you please finish your drink
and fasten your seat belt?

00:37.621 --> 00:39.122
- <i>We're just preparing ourselves...</i>
- Sorry.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.999
...<i>to land, so please finish your drinks,</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.584
- <i>sit yourselves upright...</i>
- Right.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.545
<i>...and we'll do everything we can
to make your touchdown</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.046
<i>as smooth as possible.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:18.240
Shit. Fuck.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.059
<i>So after Rockefeller Center,
why London?</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:49.062
Yitzhak told me to go.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.900
But you--
you've never even left the country before.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.819
- How did you get a passport?
- Yitzhak got me one.

03:55.819 --> 03:56.945
How?

03:56.945 --> 03:59.072
I don't know.
How does Yitzhak do anything?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.949
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm-- That's why I'm asking.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.743
He's connected, okay?

04:02.743 --> 04:03.827
Okay.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.333
My dad was there.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.048
<i>You have reached
the Royal London Travel Agency.</i>

04:17.048 --> 04:19.635
<i>Leave us a message, and we'll get back
to you as soon as we are able.</i>

04:20.886 --> 04:22.638
Hi, this is Danny Sullivan.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.056
I'm Pete Sullivan's son.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.475
I have this number for him.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.354
I was in the city, so--

04:30.354 --> 04:33.273
If Pete could give me a call back at...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.654
You know what? Never mind.
I'll just call him back later.

04:38.654 --> 04:39.738
Thank you, bye.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.117
<i>You haven't spoken much
about your biological father.</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:47.120
There's not really that much to say.
He wasn't around much,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.248
and then he was just gone.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.457
When? When was that?

04:52.084 --> 04:54.044
Adam and I were young.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.337
It was before everything.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.464
And that was before you left school?

04:57.464 --> 04:59.883
I was maybe six or something.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.427
Did you have any idea that
Yitzhak knew your father?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.012
No, not before then.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.765
I'm just trying to understand.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.770
I was in trouble, and Yitzhak sent me
to my dad for help, but--

05:11.770 --> 05:13.146
And where was Ariana?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.774
I told you already.
She bailed on me right when I needed her.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.193
Almost as if on cue.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.611
What is that supposed to mean?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.321
I mean, she left you
when you were vulnerable,

05:21.321 --> 05:24.324
and then Yitzhak stepped in
to provide you exactly what you needed.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.993
Oh, yeah? And what is that?

05:25.993 --> 05:30.372
A passport. And apparently, salvation.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.661
Excuse me.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.746
We're closed.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.583
I'm looking for Peter Sullivan.
Pete Sullivan?

06:15.459 --> 06:16.460
Never heard of him.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.589
I have this address for him.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.761
Boss will be through in a bit.
You can ask him.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.139
Can I wait here?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.726
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.229
You remember the Yank
I used to work with, Pete Sullivan?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.982
Well, this handsome, young chap in front
of you is apparently the one and only,

06:38.982 --> 06:42.486
Danny Sullivan. Son of Pete.
Isn't that marvelous?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.404
Yes.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.574
Jack.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.702
The dead spit of your dad.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.955
Come on. This calls for a drink.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.374
Don't let age go before beauty.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.294
Thank you.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.985
There you go. Bottoms up.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.367
So does my dad know that I'm here?
Is he gonna come here?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.827
- How do you know--
- Slow down, dear boy.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.954
Your father and I are business associates.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.249
- Travel agents.
- No, not exactly.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.502
- Then the travel agency is--
- We work out of the back room.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.337
Well, we did.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.422
It's just me there now.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.549
Your father's not here.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.177
He's not been in London for some time.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.554
- Okay, well, where is he?
- I don't know.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.098
I haven't spoken to him for years.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.728
Look, I'm terribly sorry.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.360
So what happened to him? Where'd he go?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.070
We had some business abroad.

08:07.070 --> 08:11.200
It didn't go as we'd hoped,
and we went our separate ways.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.040
- Is he dead?
- Good God, no.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.333
No, nothing as dramatic as that.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.836
He just thought it was wise
to stay away from London.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.755
Why?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.341
Quite the curious one, aren't you?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.511
What's your story, Danny Boy?

08:31.261 --> 08:32.929
Why have you turned up here?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.222
I needed some help.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.726
The guy I rent a room off told me
I should come to London to find my dad.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.687
And who is this mystery man?

08:42.397 --> 08:43.732
His name is Yitzhak.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.693
Safdie? Yitzhak Safdie?

08:47.736 --> 08:48.737
Wait, you know him too?

08:51.657 --> 08:52.991
Bugger me.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.410
Good for him.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.829
He kept his promise.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.749
What promise?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.001
So can I stop you for a second?

09:04.837 --> 09:06.880
I want you to consider
what you're asking me to believe,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.216
which is that
your father's business associate,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.176
and the man
who lived down the block from you,

09:11.176 --> 09:13.679
from whom you rented a room,
knew each other by coincidence?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.472
No. You're not listening to me.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.557
Okay.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.017
Jack said they'd worked together

09:19.017 --> 09:22.271
and that my dad always talked about
retiring and moving back to New York.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.856
And Yitzhak bought into it.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.024
Some-- The American dream bullshit.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.820
And that-- He said that if he came back
to America before my dad,

09:29.820 --> 09:31.405
then he would keep an eye on me.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.950
Look, I'm just telling you what he said.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.493
I'm not saying that
what he said was all true.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.203
Okay, but you believed him.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.497
Yes, we kept drinking, and I believed him.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.001
He's running alongside the plane,
waving his arms.

09:44.001 --> 09:48.130
"Stop this bloody plane!
It's my five-year-old's birthday party!"

09:48.839 --> 09:49.840
And they did.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.926
- Who's this fucking guy?
- He climbed up on a rope ladder, I think.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.678
They let him in,
and he came home to see you.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.558
Yeah, he really missed you, Danny.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.936
Yeah, I miss him too.

10:09.526 --> 10:14.740
So, Danny, are you ever going to tell me
why you're on the run?

10:16.241 --> 10:19.036
Or do you always travel halfway round
the world with just a shirt on your back?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.873
Nah, don't worry.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.920
It's all right. S-- I'll ask you
no questions, and you tell me no lies.

10:29.129 --> 10:34.384
But if you do need help, as you said,
then perhaps I can offer some. All right?

10:34.885 --> 10:39.223
Well, to friends, old and new.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.522
Right. Do you have somewhere to stay?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.816
I'm presuming
this place is slightly out of your budget.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.069
You would assume correctly.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.572
- Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Some napkins over here, please.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.491
The beer seems like it's stronger here.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.867
No, it's just that you're American.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.453
Over there, when you order beer,
they serve you carbonated urine.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.372
I think it's time you get yourself home.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.456
Wanker.

11:07.668 --> 11:11.046
Fucking septic. Jesus.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.554
What'd you say?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.016
I didn't hear you. What did you say?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.894
Because my friend over there
is visiting from across the pond,

11:25.894 --> 11:29.481
and I know that you don't want
to come across as uncourteous, do you?

11:29.481 --> 11:30.732
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

11:30.732 --> 11:35.404
No, there won't be a problem,
once this fucking cretin has apologized.

11:36.905 --> 11:37.906
Sorry.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.700
No, I'm sorry.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.368
Didn't quite catch that.

11:41.994 --> 11:45.873
One more time? Loud enough
for everybody here to hear you.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.667
I'm sorry.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.503
I don't think he can
hear you. One more time.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.092
I can't hear you.

11:58.844 --> 11:59.887
I'm sorry.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.722
There you go. Wasn't that hard, was it?

12:03.182 --> 12:05.017
I simply can't abide rudeness.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.728
I think it's time for you to leave.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.981
Come along, Danny.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.155
I just don't understand.
What was the truth?

12:18.155 --> 12:20.616
I guess the truth was that Jack,
my dad and Yitzhak

12:20.616 --> 12:22.951
had worked together
and that they did have a plan.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.370
It's just that that plan
was not to protect me.

12:26.663 --> 12:30.083
I mean, how many times can you think that
somebody is gonna come and save you,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.294
until you realize that no one is?

12:45.057 --> 12:47.267
Wanna see the real London?
Here it is. Come on.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.104
Fucking wanker.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.567
- Hello, Red. You miss me?
- No.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.030
How about I pop in this week?
Shower you with oodles of affection.

13:00.531 --> 13:01.532
Piss off.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.451
Still bitter about her sister.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.055
Who was that?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.890
Never you mind, Danny Boy.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.518
Never you mind.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.230
Let's find you somewhere to stay
that befits your station, shall we?

13:42.239 --> 13:44.157
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I put the boy to bed.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.535
Out cold. Bit of a lightweight.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.871
<i>It's a bad idea drinking before the job.</i>

13:48.871 --> 13:51.790
This is the job, Yitzhak.
I'm earning his trust.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.208
<i>This isn't the job.</i>

13:53.208 --> 13:55.669
It's been one day. I'll deliver.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.337
<i>It's not you. He must deliver.</i>

13:59.047 --> 14:01.175
Wait, you saw him
out the window on the phone?

14:03.177 --> 14:04.428
No, I saw the booth.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.724
So how could you know who he called,
let alone what he was saying?

14:08.724 --> 14:10.434
I don't know. Maybe he told me later.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.352
Look, I had had a lot to drink that night,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.731
and there's a high chance
that I'm getting things out of order.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.608
It's all a bit of a blur.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.238
So what happened the day after?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.133
Oh, shit.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.086
Oh, Danny.
Right on time. Feeling hungry?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.088
Yeah. Sure.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.340
Nothing cures a hangover
like fish and chips.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.552
Large cod and chips
with salt and vinegar.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.053
Do you want a pickled egg to go with it?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.390
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.851
Thank you, darling. Keep the change.

15:35.018 --> 15:35.853
Are you sure?

15:35.853 --> 15:36.937
Absolutely.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.449
So, Danny, you want my help.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.451
Then let me ask you something.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.288
If you were hit in the chest
by an arrow, figure it'd hurt?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.624
- What?
- An arrow hits you in the chest.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.710
Simple question. Does it hurt? Yes or no?

15:59.710 --> 16:01.336
Yes, sure.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.298
All right. Second one hits you
in exactly the same spot.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.550
- What do you think, hurts more or less?
- More.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.554
See, Buddha says
the first arrow you can't avoid.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.764
It's pain.
It's the shit that life throws at you.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.559
But the second one,
it's fear, it's anxiety.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.437
It's the story we tell ourselves
about the first arrow.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.523
It hurts as much as you let it,
or it doesn't exist at all.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.609
Understand?

16:23.609 --> 16:24.985
Why are there two arrows?

16:25.611 --> 16:26.862
I don't know why I bother.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.325
If you don't mind, you're rather lacking
in the confidence department.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.911
You must stand up straight. That's it.

16:33.911 --> 16:37.164
Put your shoulders back,
lift your head up, face the world.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.666
There you go. Feels better, doesn't it?

16:41.126 --> 16:42.211
No, not really.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.629
Well, it looks better.

16:43.629 --> 16:45.506
One should always appear proud of oneself.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.885
...it goes up by a half.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.178
All right then.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.264
How bad is this jam you're in? Here.

16:56.642 --> 16:59.019
That bad, eh? I want to help you, Danny.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.397
I think your dad would do exactly the same
if the situation were reversed and--

17:03.106 --> 17:04.398
and you were my boy.

17:04.398 --> 17:07.027
But you're going
to have to help yourself, yes?

17:08.403 --> 17:09.404
What if I can't?

17:10.656 --> 17:13.492
Screw your courage to the sticking place,
and we'll not fail.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.036
Do you always speak in riddles?

17:16.578 --> 17:19.665
It's iambic pentameter. Shakespeare.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.791
I can see why you trusted him, Danny.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.252
I really-- I can.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.755
He was everything you needed
in that moment.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.968
Kindness. Guidance.
A way out of what happened in New York.

17:30.968 --> 17:34.555
But I can say the same thing about
Yitzhak when he came into your life.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.765
And Ariana.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.850
But that's my point.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.435
They're all in this together.

17:40.435 --> 17:46.358
An Israeli expat, a British businessman,
an American girl. And your father.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.735
Well, Ariana probably got roped in later.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.322
They used her to get to me.

17:58.787 --> 17:59.788
Well, you have a better theory?

18:02.207 --> 18:04.376
Wait, do you think that
I'm the one pulling the strings?

18:07.462 --> 18:08.672
What if I said I do?

18:09.381 --> 18:10.215
I'm not.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.800
But what if you are? Just not in the way--

18:11.800 --> 18:12.885
I'm not!

18:23.478 --> 18:24.688
Danny.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.441
I needed help.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.738
I needed someone to help me.

18:34.948 --> 18:38.243
But there are people in this world that,
when they see someone in need,

18:38.243 --> 18:41.246
all they see is an opportunity.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.418
- Yitzhak?
- <i>Is it done, Jack?</i>

18:46.418 --> 18:48.212
- One more day.
- <i>Get it done.</i>

18:53.300 --> 18:56.220
What if there was a way your dad
could help you, Danny?

18:56.220 --> 18:58.305
I thought you said
you didn't know where my dad was.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.264
I don't.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.683
When you're in a bind,
what do you need more than anything else?

19:02.476 --> 19:03.894
Money, right?

19:04.686 --> 19:05.729
Sure.

19:05.729 --> 19:09.066
Play your cards right, you could walk away
from this with 3,000 quid.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.069
But it's not going to be easy.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.072
Okay. Well, what is it?

19:15.072 --> 19:18.158
The man who got into the Rolls-Royce
last night, his name's Reggie Silver.

19:18.158 --> 19:21.828
He happens to owe
your father a-an awful lot of cash.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.206
That business abroad
your father was involved in,

19:24.206 --> 19:26.124
it was an illegal import job for Reggie.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.711
Your dad, Yitzhak and I were supposed
to meet and split up the takings.

19:29.711 --> 19:33.006
Due to an unfortunate series of events,
which I won't bore you with now...

19:34.258 --> 19:36.677
your father attracted
the attention of the authorities.

19:36.677 --> 19:39.388
It was why he'd be arrested if he
came back to England.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.765
So he did not go and claim his stake.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.226
Reggie still has it.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.063
Okay, so you--

19:48.063 --> 19:52.568
So, Reggie is a mean bastard,
but he's a family man.

19:52.568 --> 19:54.069
Blood before business, all that.

19:54.069 --> 19:58.073
If you turned up, dead spit of Pete,
asked for his share,

19:58.073 --> 20:00.784
I think he might feel honor bound
to pay up.

20:01.827 --> 20:03.579
Well, why can't you just ask him?

20:03.579 --> 20:05.163
It's not for me to ask, is it?

20:06.039 --> 20:08.458
Also, Reggie and I are not exactly
seeing eye to eye at the moment.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.171
But the only person who can ask
for your father's money is you, Danny.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.593
Is that why we walked
past there last night?

20:19.511 --> 20:22.306
It's an awful lot of money. £6,000.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.057
You said £3,000. Wha--

20:24.558 --> 20:25.809
Well, it's my commission.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.563
Don't look like that.
It's just the price of doing business.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.856
I want to help you.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.819
£3,000, Danny,
will allow you to lie low for a while

20:35.819 --> 20:38.197
or look for your dad.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.449
You could start in Paris.

20:41.909 --> 20:45.162
3,000 quid, Danny Boy, gives you options.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.247
And options are what you need right now.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.420
I get it.

20:53.420 --> 20:59.092
Reggie's a dangerous individual,
and it would take a lot of balls.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.469
Perfectly well, I understand.

21:00.469 --> 21:02.095
- I wouldn't blame you if you--
- I'll do it.

21:03.597 --> 21:04.723
There you go.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.435
Good lad. Your dad would be proud of you.

21:10.771 --> 21:14.441
All right, none of this hunched shoulders,
victim of the world bollocks, all right?

21:15.567 --> 21:17.528
Men like Reggie don't respond well to it.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.404
You march in there
with a straight fucking back

21:19.404 --> 21:20.906
and a clear fucking voice.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.699
And you demand what's yours.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.452
Yes?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.120
All right.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.122
Show 'em what you're made of.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.333
Go on. Fuck off.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.461
I'll be here.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.113
Excuse me.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.490
Mop and bucket's under the bar, mate.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.832
Excuse me.

22:55.542 --> 23:00.172
I'm Danny Sullivan. Pete Sullivan's son.
He was a friend of yours.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.175
Never heard of him. Piss off.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.220
He did a job for you.

23:09.598 --> 23:12.100
He went into hiding.
I'm just here to collect his takings.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.270
What job?

23:16.897 --> 23:18.023
Who sent you?

23:22.486 --> 23:25.239
Jack.

23:25.239 --> 23:28.283
Listen to this, boys.
Apparently, Jack sent him.

23:30.327 --> 23:31.411
Go on then.

23:32.246 --> 23:33.580
Jack who?

23:35.499 --> 23:37.084
I don't know his last name.

23:40.838 --> 23:43.257
I'm just asking you to give me
what you owe my father.

23:43.257 --> 23:45.092
- Don't touch me!
- No.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.219
Let him say his piece.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.554
It's a matter of principle.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.889
I'm the only family he has left,

23:50.889 --> 23:53.100
and I can't see him anymore
because of you.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.560
Because of what he did for you.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.523
So just give me the money,

24:01.316 --> 24:02.484
and I'll leave you alone.

24:07.781 --> 24:08.824
Get him out of here.

24:08.824 --> 24:11.368
No-- Get off of me. Hey!

24:11.368 --> 24:12.870
I know you know my dad!

24:12.870 --> 24:14.496
Stop. Get off!

24:16.206 --> 24:17.583
I know you know my dad.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.548
Piss off.

24:35.809 --> 24:36.810
Jack?

24:40.480 --> 24:41.481
Jack?

24:43.442 --> 24:44.735
Jack?

24:47.571 --> 24:51.533
Hi, could I-- Could you connect me to
the Royal London Travel Agency, please?

24:51.533 --> 24:54.286
Doreen, hi. It's Danny Sullivan.
Is Jack there?

25:17.768 --> 25:19.394
Hi, excuse me,
I'm looking for my friend Jack.

25:19.394 --> 25:20.729
I think he's a regular here.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.231
You, get out.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.651
- But I-I'm just looking for my--
- Get out. Get out now,

25:25.651 --> 25:26.902
or I'll call the police.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.827
Hi, the guy that I was with earlier.
The guy that tipped you, have you s--

25:35.827 --> 25:38.205
- I'm not giving it back.
- I'm not fucking asking for it back.

25:38.205 --> 25:40.207
- I just--
- Oi, don't talk to her like that.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.043
Sorry. I didn't mean-- I'm sorry.

25:52.511 --> 25:53.428
Excuse me.

25:53.428 --> 25:56.473
Wouldn't happen to have the number
of the guy I was with last night, do you?

25:56.974 --> 25:59.059
People come to this venue for discretion.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.522
Okay, well, I can pay you. I have...

26:04.022 --> 26:05.148
Fuck off.

26:19.204 --> 26:21.081
You lied to me. Fucking--

26:22.666 --> 26:24.668
I understand you've been looking for me.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.921
Where the hell did you go?

26:27.921 --> 26:30.799
I thought I'd give you a little time
for self-reflection.

26:31.425 --> 26:33.427
Please stop pretending
like you give a shit about me

26:33.427 --> 26:35.762
when this has been about
the money the whole time.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.599
I find your attitude rather disappointing,
Danny, if I may say.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.645
As soon as you saw that I blew it,
you ditched me.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.148
Is that what you think? That you failed?

26:46.815 --> 26:48.317
- No.
- But where am I supposed to go?

26:48.317 --> 26:49.693
- I don't have any money.
- Okay, calm down.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.986
- I don't wanna calm down!
- Calm down. Hey!

26:50.986 --> 26:52.571
Now, look.

26:52.571 --> 26:56.200
I know life hasn't been easy for you.
It's unfortunate.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.745
But the past is the past.
What's done is done.

26:59.745 --> 27:03.582
Now you have to find a way
to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.878
Second arrow's of your making, remember?

27:10.005 --> 27:11.131
Come on. Sit.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.514
What this has been about is
a lesson in courage.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.599
A lesson you sorely needed.

27:20.599 --> 27:22.559
Why are you still here, Danny?

27:24.102 --> 27:25.521
What do you mean?

27:25.521 --> 27:26.730
Why don't you go home?

27:29.274 --> 27:30.692
Well, because they'll arrest me.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.777
Yes, and?

27:32.277 --> 27:34.279
What's the worst that can happen?

27:35.239 --> 27:37.991
You were scared to face Reggie,
weren't you? You did it anyway.

27:37.991 --> 27:40.619
- I got the shit kicked out of me.
- You survived.

27:41.161 --> 27:44.081
Stood there with your shoulders back.
You asked for what was yours.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.334
Now, okay,
it didn't yield the results you wanted.

27:48.252 --> 27:52.548
But it's still a victory. You were scared.
You did it. You faced the consequences.

27:54.633 --> 27:55.634
Don't keep running.

27:57.845 --> 27:58.846
Your dad ran.

28:00.264 --> 28:01.265
Didn't he?

28:02.516 --> 28:04.601
Ran from you, ran from your brother.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.853
The fuck do you care?

28:14.653 --> 28:15.654
Danny.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.077
Be the man your father never was.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.123
Look life straight in the fucking eye.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.084
I know you can do it.

28:29.835 --> 28:33.380
Danny, get rid of your passport.
Any connection to me.

28:35.966 --> 28:36.967
And go home.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.059
<i>And that was the last time you saw Jack?</i>

29:28.810 --> 29:31.396
And then when you got back,
there was no sign of Ariana?

29:32.356 --> 29:33.398
No.

29:38.904 --> 29:39.905
<i>And Yitzhak?</i>

29:41.782 --> 29:42.783
<i>No.</i>

29:44.159 --> 29:46.245
<i>They were both just gone when I got back.</i>

29:49.414 --> 29:51.083
<i>Why do you think
they would disappear</i>

29:51.083 --> 29:53.043
<i>and just leave everything that they owned?</i>

29:54.127 --> 29:55.212
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:12.831 --> 31:16.293
Police! Anyone in the house,
come out with your hands up!

31:25.219 --> 31:27.304
- Coming out the front.
- Get out here!

31:27.304 --> 31:28.514
Keep moving!

31:31.892 --> 31:33.852
Get your hands in the air now!

31:33.852 --> 31:36.063
- Keep moving forward!
- Walk slow!

31:36.063 --> 31:39.149
- Come forward. Slowly.
- Keep moving forward!

31:39.149 --> 31:41.568
- On the ground!
- Get down on the ground!

31:41.568 --> 31:42.736
Get down now!

32:06.552 --> 32:09.596
I'm gonna ask you again.
Why do you think that they would do that?

32:09.596 --> 32:13.475
Just vanish
and leave all of their things behind.

32:38.709 --> 32:42.671
Do you really think that I killed her?
That I killed both of them?

32:48.177 --> 32:50.554
Why would I do that? I loved her.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.725
- Past tense.
- Love. Loved.

32:54.725 --> 32:57.394
What fucking difference does it make?
She's gone, isn't she?

33:00.898 --> 33:02.149
I know what you're thinking.

33:02.774 --> 33:03.901
Why don't you tell me?

33:07.029 --> 33:08.906
You think that I killed them both.

33:08.906 --> 33:13.243
That I came home
and I killed Yitzhak and Ariana...

33:16.246 --> 33:18.832
out of revenge for,
I don't know, conning me.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.460
Or sending me to Jack.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.131
Only, I didn't do any of those things.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.219
And why would anyone do that anyway?

33:31.553 --> 33:34.973
Invest the years. Move to my block.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.479
Look out for me.
Pretend to defend me. Care for me.

33:41.438 --> 33:45.567
For what, £3,000?
And a lesson about courage?

33:45.567 --> 33:46.735
It doesn't make any sense.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.861
No, it doesn't.

33:51.073 --> 33:53.784
Unless it wasn't for just £3,000.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.162
Unless there was a lot more at stake.

34:04.461 --> 34:05.921
Danny, what happened to Adam?

34:14.638 --> 34:15.722
We spoke about Adam.

34:17.641 --> 34:18.891
Not really. We didn't.

34:25.482 --> 34:26.525
He died.

34:27.609 --> 34:28.610
How did he die?

34:32.114 --> 34:33.114
I'm done.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.121
I'm done.

36:11.255 --> 36:13.465
Sorry,
I was running a little late this morning.

36:13.465 --> 36:16.552
I really don't appreciate having
to come in here like this.

36:19.388 --> 36:21.056
It's nice to see you again, Jack.

36:21.056 --> 36:22.140
Is it?

36:23.851 --> 36:26.228
Your reluctance
to being here notwithstanding,

36:26.228 --> 36:29.857
Danny is clearly in a lot of trouble.
And I'm hoping that you can help me.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.817
Well, I made him come back, didn't I?

36:32.651 --> 36:34.236
Told him he had to face the music.

36:35.654 --> 36:37.281
I think it's time he knows the truth.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.787
I think that is a catastrophic idea.

36:44.621 --> 36:45.789
Is it?

36:45.789 --> 36:48.041
What if that's his only way out?
What then?
