Summer in Siesta Key

00:05.088 --> 00:07.006
{\an8}is supposed to be paradise...

00:07.090 --> 00:09.092
{\an7}What's up,
party people?

00:09.175 --> 00:10.885
{\an8}(all cheering)

00:10.969 --> 00:13.972
{\an8}...but for me, this summer felt
more like hell.

00:14.055 --> 00:17.058
{\an8}<i>I mean, my nose is broken</i>
<i>in two places.</i>

00:17.142 --> 00:19.227
{\an8}It started with my fight
with Amanda...

00:19.310 --> 00:20.395
{\an9}Oops.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.938
{\an8}Maybe some of
your anger issues

00:22.021 --> 00:22.981
{\an8}have something
to do

00:23.064 --> 00:24.232
{\an8}with just not having
a dad.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.316
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.359
{\an8}...which turned into a fight

00:26.443 --> 00:28.194
{\an8}with my mom...

00:28.278 --> 00:29.779
{\an7}This is (bleep)
bull(bleep).

00:29.863 --> 00:33.491
{\an8}...and my best friend Alex...

00:33.575 --> 00:34.576
{\an8}Hold on, hold on!

00:34.659 --> 00:35.869
{\an8}...or should I say,

00:35.952 --> 00:37.412
{\an8}ex-best friend Alex.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.622
{\an7}I think we should do
a big dinner or something.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.374
{\an8}A big dinner?

00:43.084 --> 00:46.546
Both he and Pauly were being
really mean to me.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.840
{\an1}Alex, I can't
do this anymore.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.633
After all their B.S...

00:50.717 --> 00:51.509

You got locked up again.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.178
What are you gonna
do with you life?

00:53.261 --> 00:54.596
{\an3}I wanna be
a musician.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.555
That's what I wanna do.
I wanna be a rapper.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.349
...I was pretty much done
with them both.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.438
Meanwhile, Kelsey swapped out
Garrett for Alex.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.568
But after Juliette
ratted Kelsey out...

01:08.651 --> 01:10.653
{\an1}They really have
hooked up.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.655

walking out of the cell here.

I told you that, right?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.337

{\an8}I ain't

{\an8}Now it's time to grow up.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.853
{\an8}I totally understand.

from this?

04:31.562 --> 04:32.230

04:32.313 --> 04:34.607
from staying the night
in jail?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.025
{\an1}I mean, I learned,
you know,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.360
{\an1}make sure your car
doesn't have weed in it

04:37.443 --> 04:40.363
{\an1}when you're driving
around, but, I mean...

04:40.446 --> 04:42.323
{\an5}I honestly don't plan
on stopping the weed.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.323
(Gary sighs)

04:42.407 --> 04:44.826
{\an1}But I definitely don't plan
on carrying it around

04:44.909 --> 04:48.371
{\an1}or, you know, having it
out in public anymore, for sure.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.331

don't wanna quit it.

back where you started

your attitude.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.637

05:04.721 --> 05:07.974
{\an1}I plan on putting in my past
and leaving it there,

day and night.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.103
{\an1}I've been
putting my album together.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.023
{\an1}I finally found a show to book,
The Beach Club.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.484
{\an1}It's a great opportunity
to come in and do my own music,

05:18.568 --> 05:22.697
{\an1}so I have the biggest club
on Siesta Key

05:22.780 --> 05:24.741

to come perform my music.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.242
In Paul's defense,
I mean...

05:26.325 --> 05:27.660

separate conversation

setting goals

you gotta start somewhere,

05:31.956 --> 05:35.043

he went out and, like,

05:35.126 --> 05:36.461
set up this whole gig
on his own.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.296
I didn't help at all.
No one helped him.

I know you're trying to stick up

let's just cut it there.

{\an1}to my Summer in Siesta Key
concert.

17:47.066 --> 17:47.775
At The Beach Club.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.779
And why would I wanna come?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.493
Chloe, you know,
I know we've had

17:57.576 --> 17:58.994
some ups and downs
this summer, but...

17:59.077 --> 18:00.621
Mostly downs.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.664
Calling me fat and all that

18:02.748 --> 18:05.167
is not funny
in any way, shape or form.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.796
The whole trip,
you're taking videos of me

18:08.879 --> 18:11.131
as I'm eating food,
posting videos.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.009
Both of you know how much
it hurts my feelings

18:14.092 --> 18:15.260
when you're making fun
of my weight.

18:15.344 --> 18:20.766
{\an1}So why on earth would I want
to go to your concert?

18:20.849 --> 18:24.144

it wasn't, you know,

18:24.228 --> 18:25.687
intentional to hurt you.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.816
{\an1}It was, honestly, just...
us having a good time.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.942
It wasn't--

18:28.899 --> 18:29.942
{\an3}Yeah, but

18:30.025 --> 18:31.443
at the expense
of my feelings.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.530
{\an1}I don't need people in my life
that are going to continue

18:34.613 --> 18:37.616
{\an1}to poke and pry and try
and get a reaction out of me.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.451
I never said
I was in the right.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.079
I said I was... take 100%
responsibility for being wrong.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.706
But I'm saying, like, you're not
an angel either, Chloe.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
{\an5}Like, sometimes you make--

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
{\an1}I'm not, but I've been
going to therapy

18:47.084 --> 18:49.002
and both of you
have asked me

18:49.086 --> 18:50.629
{\an5}to work on myself
and mature, and I have.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.629
I get that.

You don't need to yell,
I'm right here.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.467

mind-blown.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.095
Like, both--
neither of you see it.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.930
Like, it's common
(bleep) sense

19:00.013 --> 19:01.306
{\an1}that a girl is gonna be
sensitive about her weight,

19:01.390 --> 19:04.726
especially when I have
gained a little weight.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.061
{\an1}How about another shot,
Chloe?

19:06.144 --> 19:07.729
{\an1}This-- you know,
this conversation is getting

19:07.813 --> 19:08.897

{\an1}I didn't come here to make you
feel bad in any way.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.870
{\an1}I came here because
you're a good friend of mine

19:22.953 --> 19:25.372
{\an1}and it would mean the world
to me if you come.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.540
