01:02.312 --> 01:04.272
Mom, can you turn the music down?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.775
Mom, turn the music down.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.443
When the fuck did you sneak in?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.028
Why are you at my place?

01:10.112 --> 01:12.447
They turned the water off
in my building again.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.116
I needed a shower before the show.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.786
Also, you need to buy
some more conditioner.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.746
You didn't happen to take Tokyo
for a walk, did you?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.748
No. But I fed her.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.543
Mom, you cannot feed the dog pizza.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.420
Why? She likes it.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.131
All right. No pizza.
Don't freak out. I'm leaving.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.176
Steve is rolling sound check. I gotta
get there before he fucks up the inputs.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.802
Let me just fix this.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.347
You never do it right. Okay.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.599
You seem happy.

01:39.725 --> 01:44.062
Yeah, and guess what?
I got my first solo byline today.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.983
What does that mean? Is that a promotion?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.193
Not yet. Maybe soon.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.819
I'm covering a trial.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.822
There's this judge
who took a bunch of bribes.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.074
- So I'm gonna do a whole series.
- That's so great.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.618
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.911
Yeah.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.455
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mom.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.831
- Come by later, okay?
- Okay.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.124
- We'll celebrate.
- Okay.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.336
- All right, wish me luck!
- Good luck!

02:40.369 --> 02:42.621
Wanna play? You wanna fetch it?

02:43.539 --> 02:44.540
Go fetch.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.888
Stay still, you fucking whore.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.870
<i>That's where I ended up,
just on the ground.</i>

03:22.953 --> 03:26.498
<i>I could really see it.
The sand and cigarette butts.</i>

03:27.082 --> 03:29.084
I didn't want that to be
the last thing I saw,

03:29.168 --> 03:30.377
so I just kept moving.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.797
I wanted to get far enough
that I didn't die looking at trash.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.757
And then someone found me.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.510
Did anyone else see him?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.095
No. And I don't know how.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.139
There were lots of people there
when I showed up.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.390
Then everyone emptied out.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.601
- So, he followed you?
- No.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.811
He wasn't behind me. He was ahead of me.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.314
It was the same yesterday.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.150
So he corners you on the ledge,
and then what?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.277
Does he have a weapon?
Does he lay a hand on you?

03:55.360 --> 03:59.865
No. He didn't touch me.
He wasn't there for me.

04:01.617 --> 04:06.205
He wanted me to tell you
when he feels something, you'll know.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.249
What time was that?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.876
Around 8:30.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.671
Your car.
When he came for her, it changed.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.089
He said he was coming back.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.761
Your key chain.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.725
He took your old one
and left it in another woman.

04:27.351 --> 04:31.522
What does that mean? Is he gonna kill me?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.192
He already has. Just not yet.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.313
<i>All right, you ready?</i>

05:14.064 --> 05:15.065
<i>All right, get going.</i>

05:18.610 --> 05:22.906
<i>No, not like that.
Just be you. Like Teenie's.</i>

05:23.866 --> 05:25.951
"Teenie's." She could be a Christina.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.911
Maybe she's just short.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.789
Or maybe she's really big,
and it's like a joke name.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.166
Maybe Teenie's isn't a person.
Maybe it's a place.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.210
Somewhere she works. A bar…

05:35.294 --> 05:36.670
No, my dad would know it.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.263
All right, we should head in.
Let's try to find an address for Teenie's.

05:53.812 --> 05:57.274
You need to call Marcus?
Give him a heads-up. It'll be a few hours.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.069
He's covering the Cubs game.
He'll be at the office.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.988
You seem happy about it.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.991
- Is there a reason I shouldn't be?
- I don't know.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.912
You said you never married him,
that you came home and he was just there.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.413
So he's a stranger.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.998
He's not someone I really knew.

06:13.624 --> 06:17.085
But, like you said,
maybe he's what's to come.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.254
Maybe he's a choice I'm gonna make.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.842
Then you should tell him that.
See what he thinks.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.762
Yeah.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.656
What happened yesterday?

06:47.199 --> 06:49.660
Security asked me
if I saw anybody hang around back here.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.038
- Have you?
- No one we don't know.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.958
They also asked about you.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.085
What'd you say?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.003
That it's two days
before you're presenting

07:00.087 --> 07:02.089
years' worth of research,
so you're wound pretty tight.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.132
But, you know, that's to be expected.

07:08.554 --> 07:14.434
There was some guy on the roof
when I went up there yesterday.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.229
Seriously? What happened?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.690
Did he do something to you? Or…

07:21.859 --> 07:24.987
I have to get through this.
It'll take all night to compress.

07:32.995 --> 07:33.996
You wanna grab lunch?

07:36.248 --> 07:37.541
Your graphics
have already transferred.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.042
It's not gonna take much longer.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.630
Yeah. Just give me a minute.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.099
<i>For the first time…</i>

07:54.183 --> 07:56.101
Hey, you know, I was thinking

07:56.185 --> 07:58.395
we might wanna do
an update up on the star labs.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.148
I'm totally fine with taking care of it
if you need me to…

08:01.231 --> 08:03.233
Yeah, that's fine.

08:03.942 --> 08:08.780
<i>All around us, we see evidence
of billions of years of cosmic evolution.</i>

08:09.281 --> 08:12.576
<i>Our universe is
a vast expanse of gas and dust,</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:15.746
<i>constantly colliding, evolving, expanding.</i>

08:16.246 --> 08:18.624
<i>It is the cradle for billions of stars.</i>

08:19.249 --> 08:23.337
<i>But all it takes is one star
to change the course of a galaxy,</i>

08:23.420 --> 08:26.298
<i>a billion years into the future.</i>

08:34.890 --> 08:38.477
<i>Please remember to gather
all your personal belongings</i>

08:38.559 --> 08:40.562
<i>and visit the stars again soon.</i>

08:59.998 --> 09:03.752
Titan Tower. Tower Hobbies.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.212
There's no Teenie's.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.548
Or they could have gone out of business.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.967
Yeah, I'm not seeing it here either.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.135
We should check city records.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.515
The number's on my desk.
Could you give them a call?

09:17.015 --> 09:18.016
Yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.731
Hey.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.860
- How'd the game go?
- Good.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.571
I thought you weren't coming in today.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.823
We found a woman who knows him.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.201
We're trying to track her down.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.537
- She's not listed?
- We don't know her name.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.331
He knew her from some place. Teenie's.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.835
- The meatpacking plant in Archer Heights?
- Maybe. Why do you know that?

09:44.918 --> 09:48.463
The UFCW tried to get their workers
to go on strike a few years ago.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.715
They voted it down.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.758
I shot the story. Dan wrote the article.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.469
I don't think so. He doesn't know it.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.929
No, he doesn't remember it.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.559
You should get some other people on this.
I can drive you down there.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.643
We'll be fine.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.690
Come here.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.913
Up until, last week…

10:24.833 --> 10:26.835
I didn't really know you.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.424
And those photos you showed me,
I don't recognize any of them.

10:33.425 --> 10:37.930
I don't understand.
You're having trouble remembering?

10:38.514 --> 10:42.518
No. I was never there.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.396
Those photos--

10:46.480 --> 10:47.481
It wasn't me.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.776
Who do you think it was then?

10:52.069 --> 10:53.070
It's still me.

10:54.112 --> 10:59.368
But it's from a part of my life
that I haven't gotten to yet.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.413
Really? You think that?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.167
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:07.251 --> 11:11.129
- How long's it been like this?
- Since your birthday.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.927
Kirby,
you can't keep going after this story.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.430
You are not going to be okay.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.184
I don't know you,

11:25.811 --> 11:32.150
but we are together
because one day… I will.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.532
What the fuck is Dan telling you?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.815
I'll find the manager.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.358
The offices are back this way.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.442
Look.

12:57.528 --> 13:00.656
The precision of the cut.
He worked here.

13:03.075 --> 13:06.370
What are you doing back there?
Can I help you?

13:09.665 --> 13:12.167
No, you can't be in here in those shoes.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.253
Everything on this floor
is designed to hurt you.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.297
I'm Kirby Mazrachi. This is Dan Velazquez.
We're with the <i>Sun-Times</i>.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.842
You should have connected
with the front office, scheduled with Pam.

13:19.925 --> 13:20.926
You're the floor manager?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.886
No, this is my brother's place.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.472
We're looking for an employee of his.
Her name is Klara.

13:25.556 --> 13:28.600
Blond. In her 20s. Not too tall.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.185
She's a dancer.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.689
Yeah, the dancer. I know her.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.774
That poor girl who was killed here.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.944
Come on. Follow me.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.991
Watch your step here. Watch your step.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.701
Little slick.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.744
Hey, sorry about the lights.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.289
Some jackasses came down here
and smashed them.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.373
We get a lot of that.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.126
People know it's where they found Klara
and want to check it out.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.627
Mostly stoned-out kids.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.338
When did you stop using this area?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.174
About a decade ago.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.843
That's when we got
the refrigerated trucks.

14:03.385 --> 14:07.181
Figured it was more sanitary
to slaughter the hogs over in Aurora.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.767
We used to do it on-site though.
With that guy there.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.730
Hoist the hogs up onto the line.
Send 'em over to the sticker.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.566
He'd bleed 'em
and let it drain into the tank.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.943
That's where Klara was found.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.071
They couldn't miss her.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.991
Man, I heard she was
really bright down there.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.204
What do you mean?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.664
From the radium.

14:32.748 --> 14:36.543
She was covered in it.
This stuff has a half-life of 1,600 years.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.339
Finally gonna
get rid of the old tank.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.716
Turn this whole place into cold storage.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.804
Could your workers sneak back here,
you know, after you shut it down?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.723
There's no real reason to come here.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.642
Except to dump a body.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.811
But this whole area was up and running
when they found her.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.732
I thought you said
it had shut down ten years ago.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.236
It did. They found her in 1920.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.076
Like I said, it was a while ago.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.578
She was one of the first women
to work here.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.831
Well, I gotta get back to the deliveries.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.210
My brother's here today.
He can talk to you.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.172
That's too far back.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.466
It can't be the same woman.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.724
What? What is it?

15:52.911 --> 15:59.835
He dumped her body in this tank
with the blood and the shit.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.504
- He was trying to hide her.
- No.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.798
He was trying to punish her.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.721
- One. Two. Three. Four--
- Keep counting.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.556
Five. Six.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.725
There. That's it. That's your cue.

16:20.689 --> 16:24.568
Our on-site aperture telescope
captured this image.

16:25.903 --> 16:30.407
Overhead you'll notice a cluster of stars
at the edge of our galaxy.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.076
Omega Centauri.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.665
Now, these may look like any other stars,
but they don't belong here.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.670
Billions of years ago,
we collided with another galaxy.

16:45.214 --> 16:48.300
And these stars,
they're all that's left of it.

16:49.676 --> 16:54.723
And now, another galaxy is
making its way towards us.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.686
Andromeda.

17:02.147 --> 17:08.737
Four billion years into the future,
an irreversible collision will occur--

17:10.864 --> 17:11.865
My mic's dead.

17:12.782 --> 17:17.663
Hey, Theo. Theo, my mic's crapped out.
Can we run another sound check?

17:19.373 --> 17:20.624
My mic's dead.

17:23.669 --> 17:24.877
Hey, Theo?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.049
What is this?

17:30.801 --> 17:31.927
What are you playing?

17:51.530 --> 17:53.657
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:55.534 --> 17:56.869
<i>No!</i>

17:59.788 --> 18:00.831
<i>No!</i>

18:03.417 --> 18:04.501
<i>No!</i>

18:10.257 --> 18:11.258
Sorry about that.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.220
I ducked out to go to the bathroom
and somehow got locked out of the booth.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.097
Are you all right?

18:20.893 --> 18:23.187
They could have
employment records, union cards.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.272
The UFCW's been up and running

18:25.355 --> 18:27.191
since this place has been here, so…

18:30.235 --> 18:31.403
Kirby?

18:32.154 --> 18:33.363
Hey, you okay?

18:49.546 --> 18:52.090
Hey, your phone's been ringing nonstop.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.218
Someone named Kirby.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.970
I told her you'd call her back,
but she just keeps calling.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.055
How'd tech rehearsal go?

18:59.389 --> 19:03.393
- Hello?
- Jinny? Are you okay? Was he there?

19:04.186 --> 19:06.980
My dad ran this place,
he had tours every day.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.733
People just wanted to see
what we were up to.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.237
Let me tell you,
a real brilliant surgical butcher.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.489
He knows how to dress a hog.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.574
Used to take a whole day,
and now they hack--

19:17.658 --> 19:21.495
Just stay there. Okay, I will. Bye.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.332
- And even when my kids were small--
- Excuse me.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.000
- Sure.
- What's up?

19:27.084 --> 19:29.837
- She thinks he was there.
- Is she okay?

19:29.920 --> 19:33.215
Yeah, I tried to get her to go home,
but she's giving some big talk tonight.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.219
These are the only union cards
we have from back then.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.559
Give me those.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.562
They might have more at the hall
on West Adams.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.273
- They're all kids.
- You know, that's the way it was.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.234
They would have started at 11 or 12.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.070
There's a few John Smiths here.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.906
- They all look underage.
- Yeah.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.826
- Probably a work-around, right?
- Yeah, well.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.830
As long as you could pay the dues,
they'd put you on the line.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.292
That's her. That's Klara.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.920
Do you have anything else on her?
Maybe an address?

20:12.004 --> 20:13.714
Her family could still be around, right?

20:13.797 --> 20:15.716
I'm guessing this is all we have.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.346
- What would the younger ones do?
- Well, cattle run.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.516
They'd drive the steers
up to the killing floor.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.518
They'd be the ones to last see them alive.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.146
Well, that's how I got started.

20:29.897 --> 20:33.400
If you were too big, you'd get caught
between steers and the rails.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.444
I learned to move pretty fast.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.612
Dan.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.017
"My name is Kirby Mazrachi.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.313
I work at the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>.
My desk is in the southeast corner.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.733
Blue scissors.
Susan sits to the left of me."

21:16.610 --> 21:17.986
I don't understand what this is.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.906
I thought it was something
she just used to clear her thoughts, but…

21:23.450 --> 21:25.077
now she's saying
she doesn't remember anything.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.828
Like what?

21:26.912 --> 21:29.289
Like who she is. Like where she sits.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.416
Who she's talking to.
Everything you just read.

21:32.668 --> 21:35.546
You kept pushing her
to chase after this story.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.507
- You kept pushing her to put herself…
- No.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.717
…in the fucking paper to try
and find the fucking guy!

21:40.801 --> 21:41.969
She wanted to do all that.

21:42.052 --> 21:44.805
- And you and Dan kept clapping for her.
- Yeah. Why aren't you?

21:44.888 --> 21:47.975
Because she needs to write down
her fucking name to remember who she is.

21:48.517 --> 21:52.312
You need to talk to your wife. 'Cause I
shouldn't have seen whatever this is.

21:58.110 --> 22:02.865
You know, I never let people
take too many photos of me.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.619
I never feel like I need 'em.
I see myself.

22:08.328 --> 22:13.876
I stay in flight.
I don't cause arguments. I don't fight.

22:14.793 --> 22:21.758
But when my wife told me
what happened to her…

22:23.760 --> 22:25.512
I wanted to find him and kill him.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.724
Never felt that before, that violence.

22:30.142 --> 22:31.393
It pulled the center out of me.

22:33.562 --> 22:37.024
It changed me to somebody
I don't even recognize.

22:39.359 --> 22:44.573
And I can't even imagine
what she is going through right now.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.453
She really doesn't remember who she is.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.289
And I'm watching it happen to her.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.294
If you don't wanna hear it,

22:57.377 --> 23:01.715
then I don't know
who I am supposed to tell.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.427
Who do I tell?

23:07.679 --> 23:11.266
He could be this guy's son or grandson.

23:13.185 --> 23:16.396
- Men look like their fathers.
- You saw him. This is him.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.943
How do we tell anyone this?

23:22.027 --> 23:25.239
Maybe we publish the photo
and leave out the rest?

23:26.114 --> 23:30.244
Abby will want to know where we got it.
What do we tell her?

23:31.078 --> 23:33.247
She won't listen to me, but she knows you.

23:33.789 --> 23:34.790
She knows me.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.752
- I thought you two were close.
- No, we're close.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.549
We were close.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.929
I used to write a Sunday series.

23:50.889 --> 23:55.060
And Abby,
she would let me take my time with it.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.813
But she took you off that.

23:58.981 --> 24:02.067
The police pulled me off
a construction site on Clybourn.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.654
I had been there for weeks.

24:05.737 --> 24:09.408
I don't know,
I was so high when they arrested me.

24:11.368 --> 24:13.245
I remember that I kept telling them

24:13.328 --> 24:16.498
that I was with the <i>Sun-Times</i>
and that I was working on a story…

24:22.296 --> 24:23.797
But when Abby bailed me out,

24:24.798 --> 24:28.260
I couldn't even remember
what I was supposed to be writing about.

24:31.597 --> 24:35.350
The people I write about,
something went wrong.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.107
I meet them on the edge of their lives.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.775
And I get to be there with them,

24:44.651 --> 24:47.738
standing next to them,
standing on the precipice.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.700
And my brain shuts off.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.370
I forget about everything.

24:57.080 --> 25:01.502
Is that what's gonna happen to me?
You won't remember we were here?

25:03.337 --> 25:04.379
Dad!

25:07.132 --> 25:09.968
I should grab Freddie. Bring him with us.

25:11.053 --> 25:12.095
Dad!

25:17.559 --> 25:22.147
Hey, Freddie. Come on. Let's go.
We have to go back to the office.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.458
You type her name in there.
"Klara Meiser."

25:41.542 --> 25:43.961
And then check it out.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.300
Hey.

25:50.384 --> 25:54.471
Hey, I need your contact at CPD
to pull a file for an unsolved murder.

25:54.555 --> 25:56.598
Klara Meiser,
was killed at a slaughterhouse

25:56.682 --> 25:58.433
- in 1920.
- Sure, but-- Kirby--

25:58.517 --> 26:00.435
- Can you have them fax over a copy?
- Yeah.

26:00.519 --> 26:02.104
Abby's looking for you.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.188
Okay.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.236
Hey.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.029
You mind taking a seat?

26:12.406 --> 26:13.574
Is everything okay?

26:17.369 --> 26:20.789
Nothing I'm about to say is a reflection
of your contribution to the paper.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.250
This is about the property warehouse?

26:24.168 --> 26:27.796
I've had to have
some difficult conversations.

26:29.006 --> 26:31.049
- With who?
- This is all happening internally.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.844
You need to take a leave of absence.

26:35.095 --> 26:38.223
We'll reassess your position here
in a couple of months.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.934
Are you firing me?

26:41.602 --> 26:43.353
Take some time. Take care of yourself.

26:43.437 --> 26:46.440
And then we'll figure out
where you fit in here.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.483
- What's going on?
- Dan, give me a minute.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.776
Abby, what is this?

26:49.860 --> 26:51.236
She's firing me.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.487
It's a leave of absence.

26:52.571 --> 26:54.114
What about my story?

26:55.365 --> 26:56.617
We'll continue to cover it.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.578
But without me.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.873
Okay, just-- Let's talk this out.

27:02.956 --> 27:06.502
We just did. You need to sign
some paperwork to get your closing check.

27:07.503 --> 27:10.255
No. Okay, don't leave.
Okay? Give me a minute.

27:12.466 --> 27:15.385
This is crazy. She's telling the truth.

27:15.469 --> 27:18.222
That's fine, that's what
we printed. But she's not doing well.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.530
She found him.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.198
Really?

27:37.199 --> 27:39.034
This is where we are for now.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.412
This is from 1916.

27:42.496 --> 27:44.665
I have two eyewitnesses.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.417
- He'd be, like, a hundred years old.
- Yeah, but he's not.

27:48.001 --> 27:49.044
Because I saw him.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.421
What the fuck are you saying?

27:51.505 --> 27:56.009
It's not anyone else, Abby,
this is him. This is him.

27:56.093 --> 27:58.345
I don't know how to explain it,
but this is him.

27:58.846 --> 28:02.432
Listen, we have to publish this sketch.
And we have to show it to the families.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.601
- No. There will be none of that.
- This is him.

28:04.685 --> 28:05.686
- This is him.
- We're--

28:05.769 --> 28:08.105
- This is him!
- We're not doing any of that!

28:11.859 --> 28:15.904
Go home. Go hang out with your kid.

28:38.802 --> 28:39.928
You all right?

28:44.433 --> 28:46.351
Why do you have all my stuff?

28:46.435 --> 28:47.603
Let's get out of here.

28:49.688 --> 28:51.231
Come on, we'll talk about it at home.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.158
How did you know?

29:12.211 --> 29:14.213
You told me you don't remember me.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.258
I'd be negligent if I ignored that.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.178
So you got me fired?

29:21.762 --> 29:25.849
No, I got you a break.
Some time to figure this shit out.

29:27.351 --> 29:28.477
That's what I'm doing.

29:29.228 --> 29:32.189
It's not going really well.
Not from where I'm standing.

29:34.358 --> 29:35.359
Come on, we should go.

29:36.860 --> 29:37.986
Where?

29:39.947 --> 29:41.323
Where am I going?

29:47.788 --> 29:49.998
Just because I don't work here anymore

29:50.082 --> 29:52.251
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop looking for him.

29:54.378 --> 29:58.215
So you're gonna ignore everything else?

30:02.511 --> 30:03.679
We have a good life.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.264
It's not mine.

30:22.155 --> 30:26.451
I'll go by your place and get my things.

30:27.870 --> 30:29.246
Just give me a couple hours.

30:31.456 --> 30:32.457
Okay.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.754
Take however long you need.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.155
Hey. I just need a few minutes.

31:05.032 --> 31:06.992
I'm double-parked.
What do you want me to grab?

31:08.035 --> 31:09.578
Um, I don't know,
anything that looks like mine.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.673
Okay, Mom,
some of these are definitely Marcus's.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.843
Well, fuck him, he got you fired.
You can take whatever you want.

31:26.303 --> 31:27.429
Relax.

31:27.513 --> 31:30.098
What is this?
Did you pay money for this?

31:30.641 --> 31:32.726
- I guess.
- Well, it's not coming with us.

31:33.602 --> 31:35.979
I don't know what to pack here.
None of this feels like you.

31:36.063 --> 31:37.314
Just try the closet.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.069
Thanks for this.

31:42.152 --> 31:45.739
Oh, yeah, it's fine. Nobody else
was using the van at the ministry.

31:51.286 --> 31:54.373
Well, you're all over
the fucking place today, aren't you?

31:56.250 --> 31:57.584
Don't worry about me, okay?

31:58.919 --> 32:00.128
I don't.

32:01.588 --> 32:03.215
I know you're gonna be okay.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.679
You got so far at the <i>Trib</i>
before all that shit happened.

32:09.638 --> 32:14.852
Remember you were breaking that story
about the judge who was taking bribes.

32:14.935 --> 32:19.940
You were going to write about it
on your own and everything.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.024
Wait, what?

32:22.109 --> 32:23.777
I don't remember the creep's name.

32:23.861 --> 32:26.196
You told me about it.
It was gonna be a series.

32:30.826 --> 32:31.994
That was the night.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.164
The night I was gonna get my first byline.

32:37.875 --> 32:38.876
Yeah, I know.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.921
You were on a rocket.
You'll get back there.

32:46.258 --> 32:47.259
He knew that.

32:49.845 --> 32:51.013
He fucking knew that.

32:55.142 --> 32:56.310
I have to go.

32:56.393 --> 32:59.396
- Bring my stuff to your place.
- You know where to find me.

33:08.488 --> 33:09.865
She's probably sleeping.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.703
We can drive over to her house.
Get some food on the way.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.663
Yeah, let's do that.

33:18.624 --> 33:21.168
Kirby asked Bertie for this.
Do you know where she went?

33:21.251 --> 33:22.252
What is it?

33:22.336 --> 33:24.505
It's a police report. Some old one.

33:24.588 --> 33:27.382
- Klara Meiser. I'll take it. Thanks.
- Okay.

33:27.466 --> 33:28.717
Read me the property report.

33:33.222 --> 33:36.058
"One burlap bag. Loose paper.

33:36.141 --> 33:39.478
One fur stole, chestnut brown.
Pearl earrings."

33:39.561 --> 33:41.188
Go back. The paper.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.024
Is anything written on it?

33:46.944 --> 33:47.945
It's an address.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.907
"4232 Clifton Street."

33:51.990 --> 33:54.952
There's a bunch of numbers.
I don't think they knew what they meant.

33:55.994 --> 33:58.163
This is a date. See?

33:59.831 --> 34:03.210
April 15th, 1981.

34:04.837 --> 34:05.879
It's a receipt.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.465
From 1981?

34:10.092 --> 34:11.635
How could she have that?

34:12.928 --> 34:14.388
Isn't this super old?

34:16.806 --> 34:17.808
Okay. Let's go.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.686
Let's go.

34:50.424 --> 34:53.427
I like this.
You look like a Magellanic Cloud.

34:54.844 --> 34:56.304
That's what I was going for.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.725
Jinny, go talk to people.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.520
This is all for you. You gotta soak it up.

35:05.063 --> 35:06.064
I will.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.401
Okay. All right, see you inside.

35:15.490 --> 35:20.787
Hey, we're fucked. I can't get
the Ogden live feed to register.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.457
I linked it up this afternoon.
It should be fine.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.375
I don't know.
I tried everything. It's not showing.

36:22.808 --> 36:23.809
Jinny?

36:26.395 --> 36:28.230
I'm here. I'm fine.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.236
Where is he?

36:38.699 --> 36:41.493
Is this the place?
Maybe they have some food.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.959
Yeah, this is where the receipt's from.

36:50.002 --> 36:52.337
Probably have, like,
vending machines or something.

36:52.421 --> 36:54.047
They're not gonna
let you in there, man.

36:55.924 --> 36:58.427
I'll be quick. Okay?

37:53.815 --> 37:55.817
<i>I don't understand
why he isn't here.</i>

37:55.901 --> 37:57.402
This is how it was for me.

37:58.028 --> 37:59.821
This was your night.
This is what you wanted.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.365
This is what you worked towards.

38:01.949 --> 38:06.453
He knew that. He should've been here.
Where is he? Why isn't he here?

38:07.454 --> 38:10.374
I don't care. I'm fucking late.
I have to grab my notes.

39:00.632 --> 39:02.134
How did you find her?

39:46.720 --> 39:47.721
Thanks, man.

40:06.740 --> 40:09.201
I'm sorry, I can't let you in.
The lecture's about to start.

40:09.701 --> 40:11.745
Well, not without me. I'm Dr. Gwansun.

40:13.705 --> 40:16.959
Okay. And I'm Mike from Lake View.

40:17.042 --> 40:19.586
I'm the keynote speaker. Look.

40:22.714 --> 40:25.676
Who changed that? Why is that there?

40:35.435 --> 40:38.063
Mike? What's going on out here?
We need to get started.

40:39.231 --> 40:43.318
Hi, we're about to get going,
if you wanna grab your seat.

40:43.402 --> 40:44.403
What are you talking about?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.071
I'm presenting a talk.

40:46.655 --> 40:48.407
Cut it out. You're being fucking weird!

40:48.490 --> 40:49.658
Wait-- I'm sorry, who are you?

40:49.741 --> 40:52.077
Ma'am, this is a private event.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.496
You'll have to come back
when we're open for the public.

40:55.873 --> 40:59.001
Can you hear me?
You need to leave now, okay?

41:42.419 --> 41:43.629
What's happened to us?

41:50.928 --> 41:52.513
Hey.

41:53.555 --> 41:54.806
You're my dad's friend, right?

41:57.226 --> 42:00.270
Hey, Freddie! How you doing?

42:01.980 --> 42:04.608
Were you hanging out with my dad?
When's he coming out?

42:06.527 --> 42:08.320
Oh, no. I haven't seen him around.

42:09.571 --> 42:13.116
He was in the bar. That one.
You just came out of there.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.826
Well, you know,
it's a pretty big place in there.

42:14.910 --> 42:17.704
It's loud, so must've missed him.

42:21.291 --> 42:23.752
That's his jacket. Why are you wearing it?

42:26.129 --> 42:28.298
- That's my dad's jacket.
- I don't think so.

42:30.759 --> 42:32.845
You take care, Freddie. All right?
