WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.120
Welcome home.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.520
You're a Kinsella,
and we stick together.

00:07.640 --> 00:08.600
Always.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.040
Frank: You and I have been
doing business

00:12.240 --> 00:13.520
since before
Moore was born.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.640
Eamon:
It's not personal, Frank.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.320
It's just
the model's changing.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.280
You're either all in with me
or you're not.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.840
Caolan: I want to deal
with Viking meself,

00:22.000 --> 00:23.440
if you give it the okay.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.480
Go on.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.080
Viking: Jamie! Jamie!
An ambulance, will ya?!

00:27.240 --> 00:28.840
Amanda: Who's gonna pay
for this?

00:29.040 --> 00:30.840
You said whoever killed him
would pay.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.800
Michael: Well, I can't be
involved in any of that.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.360
Not if I want
to see Anna.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.400
You done it before for money.
Do it now for family.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.440
Gunshots

00:37.600 --> 00:38.360
Crowd screaming

00:38.520 --> 00:40.320
Eamon: You have no idea

00:40.480 --> 00:42.320
what you have
just fucking started.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.280
You're all done,
'cause you're fucking dead.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.480
Dr. Rooney: I'd say
it's possible you may
have developed epilepsy.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.360
Michael:
If I take these,

00:49.520 --> 00:51.320
will it be like I'm
normal again?

00:51.520 --> 00:52.840
If you have any worries,
just come back and see me.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.040
Answer me, Michael.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.720
Why'd you kill her?

00:56.880 --> 00:58.040
Michael: It was an accident.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.360
How do you accidentally
shoot someone?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.320
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt your mother.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.800
Crying

01:04.960 --> 01:06.600
Jimmy: You know I never once
tried to punish you.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.240
You make me feel
like the shitty one

01:08.440 --> 01:10.040
'cause you
fucked my brother?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.800
Michael: Are you trying
to blow everything up?

01:12.920 --> 01:14.200
Boom.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.800
We can't just sit here,
waiting to be killed.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.080
Then what do we do?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.040
Then we have to be
smarter than him.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.920
Eamon:
How much did they get?

01:24.080 --> 01:24.960
Con: All of it.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.640
We have your drugs.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.400
I'll get them back,
and then I'll kill

01:28.600 --> 01:29.920
Frank and Michael
and Jimmy,

01:30.080 --> 01:31.800
every last fucking one
of them.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.520
Amanda: So, who is it
you talk to, Kem?

01:33.680 --> 01:35.080
Is it Eamon himself?

01:35.280 --> 01:36.800
I'm not a fucking rat,
if that's what you think.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.200
Cullen: We believe Jamie's
killing was in retaliation

01:39.400 --> 01:42.320
for a shooting that happened
a couple of nights earlier.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.520
You saying I should
give up my son?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.800
I'm just telling you
what's gonna happen.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.480
They already have Eric.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.560
Now they're just
widening their net

01:50.720 --> 01:52.200
to see what else
they can catch.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.640
If this blows up, we'll have
Fraud and Revenue after us.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.120
They'll close
the dealership down.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.720
Nikita: He's going
to see your uncle.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.160
To get you
to go in with him.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.280
Bren's sound.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.320
Frank:
It's about Eric.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.960
He's gonna be
coming inside.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.920
I'm not having him
fuck up my parole.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.000
Please.
You're too busy sucking cock

02:09.200 --> 02:10.800
to fucking run
this family properly.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.840
Frank!

02:13.960 --> 02:15.480
I need an ambulance.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.080
Viking: There's an eyewitness
to the shootin'.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.840
Take 20 grand from
the stash in the ceilin'

02:20.000 --> 02:21.280
and get Kem
to hire someone

02:21.440 --> 02:22.400
to have them clipped.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.920
Cenk:
Welcome home, Eamon.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.120
My father wants
to see you.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.360
It's all okay, Cenk.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.680
Problem's been fixed.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.640
You can tell him that.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.720
Gunshot
Thud

02:31.960 --> 02:33.280
Gunshot
Thud, clatter

02:33.480 --> 02:34.960
What the fuck
have you done?

02:35.160 --> 02:36.200
She's agreed
to a peace.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.080
She lied.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.480
Gunshot

02:39.680 --> 02:40.840
Thudding

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
Amanda: You just don't get it,
do you, Mam?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.160
I'm a Kinsella now.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.920
Vehicles passing

02:57.120 --> 02:59.640
Brush sweeping

03:08.080 --> 03:09.840
Horn blares

03:10.000 --> 03:12.280
Tires screech

03:14.720 --> 03:16.400
Engine revs

03:16.600 --> 03:17.800
Tires screech

03:18.000 --> 03:19.120
Engine revs

03:22.280 --> 03:23.680
Coughing

03:27.920 --> 03:30.480
Tires screech

03:30.680 --> 03:32.240
Do you want me
to call an ambulance?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.520
Get the fuck
out of here.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.360
Go! Lady!
They're coming!

03:41.400 --> 03:42.600
Gun cocks

03:57.520 --> 03:59.800
Horn honking

04:02.400 --> 04:03.720
Both grunting

04:06.280 --> 04:07.800
Gunshot
Bullet clangs

04:07.920 --> 04:09.240
Aw, for fuck's sake.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.840
Fuck!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.240
Clicking

04:19.360 --> 04:20.600
Fuck.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.320
He's after
fucking stabbing me.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.320
Give me the gun
and get out to the car.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.360
I'll do it myself,
ya fuckin' dope!

04:27.560 --> 04:28.800
Gun cocks

04:35.600 --> 04:38.640
Grunting Please.
Please, don't shoot.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.720
Brother, please.
Please, man, don't.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.000
I've got two kids, man!
Please!

04:44.200 --> 04:45.920
We won't say anything.
We swear.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.520
Bullet casing rattles

04:58.560 --> 05:00.480
Sea birds crying

05:18.680 --> 05:19.960
Engine shuts off

05:50.360 --> 05:52.200
Sirens wailing

06:08.280 --> 06:10.080
Breathes deeply

06:11.960 --> 06:13.440
Man: Let's go.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.920
Tires screech

06:52.600 --> 06:55.080
Conversing in native language

07:02.040 --> 07:03.280
Tires squeal

07:13.600 --> 07:15.200
Inhales sharply

07:41.720 --> 07:43.320
Speaks native language

07:49.520 --> 07:51.440
What's so urgent?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.400
Your order's in transit.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.040
The first half
of your payment is due.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.680
I know.
I'll have it by Friday.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.240
I want it today.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.280
That's the account
we want it in.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.600
And not all in one go.
Multiple transactions.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.080
It's not me first rodeo.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.840
Then I can expect
those lodgements in

08:14.000 --> 08:15.720
by close of business?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.280
Groans

08:19.480 --> 08:21.120
Ship horn blares

08:21.320 --> 08:23.640
Train wheels clacking

08:42.520 --> 08:44.240
-Did you get it all?
-Yeah.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.080
Kinsella?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.680
Yeah.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.400
Buzzer

08:58.600 --> 09:01.400
Just one.
The other one waits out here.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.640
Yeah.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.080
Bag rustling

09:12.120 --> 09:13.480
Woman: The only evidence
that places

09:13.680 --> 09:15.680
my client at the scene
of the shooting

09:15.920 --> 09:18.560
is a single eyewitness's
testimony --

09:18.720 --> 09:20.640
an eyewitness
who has since passed away.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
You mean murdered

09:22.600 --> 09:24.680
in a targeted assassination
at a supermarket.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.400
That is unfortunate,

09:26.600 --> 09:29.960
but if that witness is not
available to be cross-examined,

09:30.160 --> 09:32.960
their statement must be
deemed inadmissible.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.040
We ask that all charges
be struck out.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.400
Does the prosecution object
to the defense's application?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.280
No, Judge.
Exclaims

09:42.440 --> 09:45.280
This court
strikes out all charges

09:45.440 --> 09:47.200
against Eric Xavier Kinsella

09:47.400 --> 09:50.600
in relation to the shooting
on the 20th of September.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.840
Gavel bangs

10:26.560 --> 10:28.040
How does this work?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.600
You give them that code,

10:29.800 --> 10:31.800
they take it to a colleague
of mine in Madrid,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.280
he'll pay them
$2 million.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.600
Just like that?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.920
Yes.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.360
Knock on door

10:53.160 --> 10:54.240
You ready?

10:56.760 --> 10:58.800
Yeah, just give me a minute.
I'll see you in the car.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.600
Glass thuds on counter

11:14.800 --> 11:15.960
Exhales sharply

11:18.040 --> 11:19.600
Here he is.

11:19.800 --> 11:20.800
Laughs

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
Hello, love.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.600
Oh. Good to see you.
You good?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.320
I'm better
now that I've seen you.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.200
Hey!
Laughs

11:32.720 --> 11:34.040
Where's Frank?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.480
He's just helping Amanda
with a bit of business.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.960
They're coming later,
though.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.000
They're meeting us
at the restaurant.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.240
Nice wheels.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.640
Oh, well. Glad you like it.
Because it's yours.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.680
Fuck off. No way!

11:52.840 --> 11:54.400
Check out the boot.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.840
Business must be good.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.640
You have no idea.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.720
Cackles
Let's fucking go!

12:15.560 --> 12:16.960
Telephones ringing

12:19.520 --> 12:21.120
Elevator bell dings

12:21.320 --> 12:23.280
Doors slide

12:26.120 --> 12:28.600
Well?
All done.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.440
Let them know
we're here?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.240
Did you bring
what we asked?

12:48.360 --> 12:49.480
Of course.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.040
I'll go check this.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.600
So...do we talk
to you or him?

13:04.800 --> 13:07.240
My father would rather
not have to send a daughter

13:07.400 --> 13:10.360
to look after
his business.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.400
But one of your family
killed his son.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.800
Eamon Cunningham was trying
to wipe this family out.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
We had to
protect ourselves.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.600
My brother had no involvement
in any of that.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.040
Michael thought it was
one of Eamon's bodyguards.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.240
What happened
was a terrible mistake.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.800
But we're here
to make amends...

13:30.000 --> 13:31.480
for the loss
of your brother.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.720
My family has lost
their only boy.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.440
How do you make amends
for that?

13:36.640 --> 13:38.080
We just handed over
$2 million.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.000
That was the price of
this meeting, nothing more.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.520
We're willing to double that sum
to ensure Michael's safety.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.360
Michael Kinsella
killed my brother,

13:47.520 --> 13:48.880
and he will pay for that.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.400
Why come here if you're
not going to negotiate?

13:51.600 --> 13:55.560
To discuss Eamon Cunningham's
death to my family.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.920
He owed my father
almost $70 million.

13:59.120 --> 14:04.360
And, as you killed him,
the debt is now yours.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.880
You're fucking joking.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.360
You have been making
lots of money

14:07.560 --> 14:09.040
from the drugs
that you stole.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.200
Nothing like $70 million.
That's your problem.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.960
I'm just telling you
what you owe.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.080
This is
fucking bullshit.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.640
I imagined you would
respond like this.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.120
And, honestly,
I hope you tell my father

14:24.280 --> 14:26.880
to go fuck himself.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.480
This is the outcome
I would like.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.160
Because then, it won't be just
Michael who is a target,

14:33.360 --> 14:36.600
but every single one
of your family.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.360
That transfer
has been received.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.160
Door closes

14:46.280 --> 14:48.560
I fly home tomorrow.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.600
If by then I haven't heard how
you intend to repay the debt,

14:52.800 --> 14:55.600
my father will assume
our families are at war.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.520
Passionate moaning

15:19.400 --> 15:20.720
Welcome home.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.200
Both laugh

15:24.320 --> 15:26.040
Kissing

15:29.360 --> 15:33.960
Thanks for arranging
that thing for me.

15:34.120 --> 15:38.720
I don't want to have to do
anything like that again.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.920
You won't.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.200
I'm here now.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.240
I'll look after everything.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.600
Okay?

15:48.760 --> 15:50.120
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.440
We'll start with three bottles
of the Louis Roederer Cristal,

15:53.680 --> 15:56.000
and I want some nibbles
as well for the table --

15:56.240 --> 15:59.360
the crispy quail eggs,
the pâté,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.320
and the Dublin Bay prawns.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.880
Thank you.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.200
I've ordered
the champagne.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.240
Lovely.
Okay.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.080
Let's get our booze on.
Ahh.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.920
Viking:
There he is now.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.640
Who's Mister
fucking Boy Band?

16:21.800 --> 16:25.080
That's Dan,
the new...

16:27.440 --> 16:30.080
-Hey.
-Ill fuckin' time.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.200
-Hey.
- Chuckles

16:35.920 --> 16:37.080
It's great
to have you back.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.240
Thanks, Da.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.280
Jimmy,
I'll follow you over.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.360
Did you lose
your watch?

16:44.520 --> 16:46.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come here.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.640
Hey, you've been juicin'?
You big con.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.520
Fuck off. Yeah.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.960
-You look great.
-You too. You good?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.400
-Yeah, yeah.
-How did it go, Frank?

16:56.600 --> 17:00.080
They wouldn't even discuss
a figure for Michael.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.800
They want a head.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.560
And that's not all.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.800
Urinating

17:12.120 --> 17:14.800
Breathes deeply

17:40.080 --> 17:41.720
Phone clicking

17:46.520 --> 17:48.520
Breathing heavily

17:57.160 --> 17:58.480
Rory, you can go.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.040
Jimmy's gonna drive me
in his car.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.680
Are you sure?
I don't mind waiting.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.840
Yeah, positive.
Thanks.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.000
Engine starts

18:08.160 --> 18:09.520
Hey. You okay?

18:09.680 --> 18:11.200
Let's just go.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.720
Engine starts

18:19.920 --> 18:21.520
Tires squeal

18:23.400 --> 18:25.200
Amanda:
What did you tell them?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.200
That your Ma had a fall
and we had to go to hospital,

18:27.360 --> 18:28.840
like you said.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.520
They probably think you're
trying to avoid Viking.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.560
I don't care
what they think.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.920
Just as long
as it's not this.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.120
How could Eamon Cunningham
owe $70 million?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
He was minted!

18:42.440 --> 18:43.920
On other people's money.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.640
That has to be bullocks.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
They're talking through
their fuckin' hoop.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.960
What?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.520
We're not paying it.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.680
Just out of one war, you want
to go starting another one

18:58.840 --> 19:02.200
with someone else --
someone even bigger?

19:02.360 --> 19:04.280
So what do we do?

19:04.480 --> 19:07.400
See how much cash
we can lay our hands on.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.040
But it's not gonna be
anything like what they want.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.800
Oh, for fuck's sake.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.080
This is some
fucking party.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.800
Indistinct conversations

19:21.000 --> 19:22.800
Man: So it's been
around 12 weeks?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.400
Uh, 13 on Friday.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.800
Hm. And it was
an assisted conception?

19:26.960 --> 19:29.480
Yeah. IVF.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.640
Okay.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.840
We'll do a quick scan just to
give it some peace of mind.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.960
Tuck it in there.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.920
Gonna be a small bit cold.
Okay?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.840
So, can you --
can you see the heartbeat?

20:23.160 --> 20:25.600
Sighs
I'm really sorry, Amanda.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.720
I know this is coming as a shock
to both of you,

20:28.920 --> 20:32.400
but I think it's important
we move quickly.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.680
I'm going to contact
the surgeons and call,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.560
see about getting you in
to theater this afternoon...

20:37.760 --> 20:39.600
Dialogue fades

20:39.800 --> 20:43.280
High-pitched buzzing

20:43.440 --> 20:45.200
Woman: Amanda?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.960
Amanda. Amanda.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.080
Monitor beeping

20:53.240 --> 20:55.600
Gonna give you
some anesthetic now.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.000
So you might feel
a slight pinching.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.160
Amanda, if you could count
backwards from 10 to 1.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.280
What happens to the baby
after you take it out?

21:03.480 --> 21:07.200
Like this, Amanda.
10, 9...

21:07.360 --> 21:09.280
But what do you do
to the baby?

21:09.440 --> 21:13.360
8, 7, 6...

21:13.480 --> 21:15.040
5...

21:15.240 --> 21:16.280
Sobs

21:16.440 --> 21:18.960
...4...

21:19.080 --> 21:21.840
3...2...

21:36.781 --> 21:38.541
Goat bleating

21:51.301 --> 21:52.981
Brakes hiss

22:12.581 --> 22:14.101
Dog barking

22:24.741 --> 22:26.661
Lock clicking

23:09.941 --> 23:12.101
This is the man
I was telling you about.

23:12.301 --> 23:14.381
He's found
Michael Kinsella.

23:18.501 --> 23:19.821
And they can get to him.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.821
Just say the word.

23:24.381 --> 23:25.901
Do it.

23:26.101 --> 23:27.661
Three way, that one sequel

23:27.861 --> 23:29.181
Told God I won't leave you

23:29.421 --> 23:30.821
It's all about love,
no hate, no evil

23:31.021 --> 23:32.341
I might, woo

23:32.581 --> 23:34.061
Fall into the trap
of the feeble

23:34.301 --> 23:35.621
War my bruddas,
they need you

23:35.861 --> 23:37.301
I only see stars
when I see you

23:37.541 --> 23:38.821
What's madder
than a black and illegal?

23:39.061 --> 23:40.301
And melanin,
there's too much hope

23:40.541 --> 23:41.821
Said they wanna put pain
in the dope

23:42.061 --> 23:43.381
And they be the killers
that feed you the most

23:43.581 --> 23:44.741
Nikita: I didn't need
a whole bankroll

23:44.861 --> 23:46.741
to tip a Deliveroo rider.

23:48.541 --> 23:52.421
Here. Do you believe that story
about Amanda's Ma falling?

23:52.621 --> 23:55.421
Who cares?
Fuck her.

23:55.621 --> 23:57.221
She's in for
a rude awakening.

23:57.381 --> 23:58.981
What'ya mean?

23:59.141 --> 24:02.461
You're just out, Eric.
Don't go doing anything stupid.

24:02.621 --> 24:06.821
No, no. Not me.

24:06.981 --> 24:09.221
Someone else is
gonna sort her out.

24:09.421 --> 24:11.861
I'm just gonna stand back
and watch it all go off.

24:12.021 --> 24:13.341
And what's that
supposed to mean?

24:13.501 --> 24:14.981
It means...

24:15.181 --> 24:16.821
the clock is ticking
for Amanda.

24:16.981 --> 24:18.981
Will you just stop trying
to be all fuckin' mysterious

24:19.141 --> 24:20.701
and just tell me?

24:20.941 --> 24:22.621
Clicking tongue

24:22.821 --> 24:24.461
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.

24:24.581 --> 24:27.061
Eric.

24:27.261 --> 24:29.581
It means her time
is coming.

24:29.781 --> 24:31.061
When I tell me
I love you different

24:31.301 --> 24:33.261
If you know
just what's missing

24:33.501 --> 24:35.221
You might as well stay
in the kitchen

24:35.421 --> 24:37.621
Door opens in distance

24:37.821 --> 24:39.221
Monitor beeping

24:39.421 --> 24:41.981
Baby crying in distance

24:56.781 --> 24:58.501
Door opens

25:03.101 --> 25:05.421
Hey.

25:05.581 --> 25:06.941
You're awake.

25:07.101 --> 25:08.341
Yeah.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.941
Doctor said
it went well.

25:18.061 --> 25:20.141
What does "well" mean?

25:20.341 --> 25:23.501
That you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

25:23.701 --> 25:25.421
And that's
the important thing.

25:36.621 --> 25:39.181
You hungry? You want me
to get you a bite to eat?

25:39.341 --> 25:41.461
Some tea? Or a drink?

25:41.661 --> 25:44.101
Um, no.

25:48.541 --> 25:52.381
You should just --
You should go home, Jimmy.

25:52.581 --> 25:54.301
I'm just gonna sleep.

25:54.501 --> 25:57.741
And Anthony's at home
on his own.

25:57.941 --> 26:00.821
I'll call you
if I need anything.

26:06.941 --> 26:10.661
Sure? I don't --
I don't mind staying.

26:10.821 --> 26:14.541
Yeah. No. Go on.

26:14.701 --> 26:16.141
I'll be grand.

26:23.421 --> 26:26.941
Yeah.
I'll keep my phone on.

26:27.141 --> 26:28.861
Okay.
Yeah.

26:38.701 --> 26:40.101
See ya.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.301
Door closes

26:49.501 --> 26:51.861
Footsteps depart

27:45.941 --> 27:47.501
Thumping

28:22.061 --> 28:25.141
His keys are here.
He's around here somewhere.

28:25.341 --> 28:28.501
Indistinct whispering

28:28.661 --> 28:30.261
Wood creaks

28:42.661 --> 28:43.901
Metal clanging

28:44.061 --> 28:45.861
He's outside.
Let's go.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.461
Metal clanging

29:00.301 --> 29:01.381
Gasps

29:01.581 --> 29:02.901
Gunshot

29:06.661 --> 29:08.301
Clicking

29:11.781 --> 29:13.021
Gunshot

29:47.941 --> 29:50.301
Siren wailing

29:54.621 --> 29:56.341
Wheels rolling

29:56.541 --> 29:59.661
Amanda breathes deeply

30:07.581 --> 30:09.181
Cellphone buzzes

30:56.221 --> 30:58.621
Father: Lamb of God, you
take away the sins of the world.

30:58.741 --> 31:00.301
Have mercy on us.

31:00.461 --> 31:03.821
Lamb of God, you take away
the sins of the world.

31:03.981 --> 31:07.221
Happy are those who are called
to supper on the lamb.

31:07.421 --> 31:10.861
Congregation:
Lord, I am not worthy to...

31:11.061 --> 31:14.061
but only say the word
and I shall be healed.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.661
Body of Christ.

31:25.781 --> 31:26.821
Body of Christ.

31:26.981 --> 31:28.901
Amen.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.221
Body of Christ.

31:30.381 --> 31:31.381
Amen.

31:34.901 --> 31:36.101
Body of Christ.

31:36.261 --> 31:37.621
Amen.

31:43.981 --> 31:45.061
Body of Christ.

31:45.181 --> 31:46.381
Amen.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.661
Body of Christ.

31:58.141 --> 32:00.261
Telephone ringing

32:04.981 --> 32:06.341
Door opens

32:08.781 --> 32:10.501
Let me know
if you need anything.

32:13.461 --> 32:15.181
Door closes

32:17.781 --> 32:20.061
So you are the one
in charge.

32:25.061 --> 32:28.421
That means you ordered
the shooting that killed Cenk.

32:28.621 --> 32:30.941
Do you want to hear what
I have to offer or not?

32:34.381 --> 32:36.621
You say the debt
is $70 million.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.101
I'm willing
to pay $90 instead.

32:39.261 --> 32:42.661
I presume the extra twenty
comes with a price.

32:42.821 --> 32:44.021
Michael.

32:44.181 --> 32:45.421
I've told you.

32:45.621 --> 32:48.821
He will not be a part
of any arrangement.

32:49.021 --> 32:52.861
The men sent to kill him
last night failed.

32:53.061 --> 32:56.421
And you'll keep failing.
'Cause he is good at this.

32:56.621 --> 32:59.381
We only need to be
successful once.

32:59.501 --> 33:01.061
Well, if you do get him,

33:01.261 --> 33:04.261
all you'd have done is cost
your family $90 million.

33:04.461 --> 33:07.101
'Cause we won't pay a penny
if you kill him.

33:07.301 --> 33:09.541
Is that supposed to
be a threat?

33:09.741 --> 33:12.821
You may think
that killing Michael

33:13.021 --> 33:16.981
will ease the pain
of your brother's death.

33:17.101 --> 33:20.221
But it won't.

33:20.381 --> 33:23.421
Nothing will.

33:23.621 --> 33:26.301
My son was murdered
eight months ago,

33:26.501 --> 33:31.461
and I made sure that
those responsible are dead.

33:31.621 --> 33:34.981
But the pain I feel
is the same.

33:39.701 --> 33:41.261
You're not me.

33:44.141 --> 33:46.461
I know your father
is dying.

33:49.981 --> 33:53.341
Now would be a good time to
show how well his daughter

33:53.501 --> 33:57.101
can handle his affairs.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.261
You can return home
and tell him

33:59.461 --> 34:02.381
that you failed
to kill Michael again

34:02.541 --> 34:05.381
and that you failed to
get any money out of us...

34:05.581 --> 34:08.301
or you can return
with the news

34:08.461 --> 34:12.061
that you secured $90 million
for your family.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.021
Which will
impress him more?

34:20.261 --> 34:22.461
If it means
sparing Michael,

34:22.661 --> 34:25.661
he would rather I came home
with nothing.

34:25.781 --> 34:27.981
How can you be sure?

34:28.141 --> 34:31.101
$90 million.

34:31.261 --> 34:32.701
That's a lot to give up.

34:39.181 --> 34:42.501
You have four months
to pay the debt.

34:42.661 --> 34:45.101
That's not enough time.

34:45.301 --> 34:47.741
Four months...
or nothing.

34:59.261 --> 35:03.301
Door opens and closes

35:43.309 --> 35:45.189
Father: Can I help you
with anything?

35:51.029 --> 35:52.869
I have a question
for you.

35:53.029 --> 35:54.869
Well, if I can answer it,
I will.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.429
So, I was dead.

36:02.629 --> 36:04.069
My heart stopped
for nearly three minutes

36:04.269 --> 36:06.989
before the paramedics
resuscitated me.

36:09.469 --> 36:12.789
In all that time...

36:12.949 --> 36:14.869
nothing.

36:14.989 --> 36:19.269
No bright light nor...

36:19.429 --> 36:20.749
no warm sensation

36:20.949 --> 36:24.469
or any of the things
that you hear.

36:24.629 --> 36:26.549
That can't be
a good sign.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.989
Were you expecting
a good sign?

36:33.429 --> 36:36.789
Do you ever consider that maybe
God spared you for a reason?

36:40.469 --> 36:42.549
What reason?

36:42.709 --> 36:44.349
Only He knows that.

36:46.989 --> 36:48.949
The Bible is filled
with plenty of people

36:49.149 --> 36:53.789
who repented their sins
and found peace.

36:53.949 --> 36:56.149
And from where I'm standing,
you don't look like a man

36:56.349 --> 36:58.949
that has a lot of peace
in his life.

37:02.949 --> 37:07.109
We hear confessions
every Friday.

37:07.269 --> 37:09.029
Come if you'd like.

37:17.389 --> 37:19.349
I don't think
that's a good idea.

37:22.549 --> 37:24.509
God never forgets you.

37:43.989 --> 37:45.989
Engine shuts off

38:25.909 --> 38:27.789
Hey, you.

38:27.949 --> 38:29.589
Hey ya.

38:29.789 --> 38:33.349
You should've called me.
I'd have collected you.

38:36.989 --> 38:38.909
What did
the doctors say?

38:42.309 --> 38:44.709
I need you
to call a meeting.

38:44.909 --> 38:46.269
You should be
taking it easy.

38:46.469 --> 38:49.669
What for?
The baby's already dead.

38:49.829 --> 38:51.629
Can't kill it again.

38:51.829 --> 38:55.309
You know
that wasn't your fault.

38:55.429 --> 38:57.429
Just call a meeting.

39:08.629 --> 39:10.269
Brake clicks

39:10.469 --> 39:11.709
Engine shuts off

39:29.069 --> 39:30.869
Whirring

39:34.709 --> 39:36.389
Welcome home, Eric.

39:36.549 --> 39:39.949
How's your Ma?
Nothing broken, I hope.

39:40.069 --> 39:41.589
No.

39:41.709 --> 39:42.989
Glad to hear.

39:48.149 --> 39:51.789
-Hiya.
-So...

39:51.949 --> 39:54.349
what's so urgent,
couldn't wait?

39:54.549 --> 39:56.589
Michael had visitors
last night.

39:56.709 --> 39:57.869
Is he okay?

39:58.069 --> 39:59.709
He's fine.
He dealt with it.

39:59.869 --> 40:02.269
But he can't stay there
any longer.

40:02.469 --> 40:05.629
So I went to see
Nuray Batuk.

40:05.829 --> 40:07.309
What, without telling
anyone here?

40:07.509 --> 40:09.669
I needed to see her
before she left.

40:11.869 --> 40:16.109
So, you just do whatever
the fuck you want now?

40:16.309 --> 40:18.669
-Is that it?
-It's done.

40:18.829 --> 40:20.749
Well, it shouldn't
have been fuckin' done.

40:20.909 --> 40:23.589
Not without talking
to the rest of us first.

40:23.829 --> 40:27.149
Chuckles Have youse
forgotten what she did?

40:27.349 --> 40:28.949
She went behind
your back, Da.

40:29.069 --> 40:30.109
Had Eamon clipped.

40:30.309 --> 40:31.669
Bit of respect, Eric.
No.

40:31.829 --> 40:32.789
She tried
to have me killed.

40:32.909 --> 40:34.349
That's not true.

40:34.589 --> 40:35.749
What Eamon told Birdy
was a lie.

40:35.949 --> 40:37.109
He chose you, not me.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.309
Of course you were
gonna say that.

40:38.429 --> 40:39.549
You think Eamon Cunningham

40:39.749 --> 40:41.349
would let me decide
something like that?

40:41.509 --> 40:43.789
He was winding Birdy up
and causing shit.

40:45.549 --> 40:48.109
Tell me you're not buying
that fucking bullshit.

40:48.309 --> 40:50.189
I'm not gonna
warn you again, Eric.

40:50.349 --> 40:54.509
Nuray Batuk has agreed to take
the bounty off Michael's head.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.469
Viking: Great.

40:56.669 --> 40:58.549
And what about
Eamon's debt?

40:58.749 --> 41:00.509
They've given us four months
to find the money.

41:02.349 --> 41:04.789
But we still have to pay them
the $70 million?

41:04.989 --> 41:07.069
-$90 million.
-Wow.

41:07.269 --> 41:10.069
The extra $20 million is a fee
for the four-month grace period

41:10.269 --> 41:12.109
and getting
Michael home.

41:12.349 --> 41:14.749
But it will be safe
for Mikey to come home, then?

41:14.909 --> 41:16.509
-Yeah.
-This is bollocks.

41:16.709 --> 41:18.589
We're still paying them
a fuckin' fortune.

41:18.789 --> 41:20.189
That debt
is a blessing.

41:20.349 --> 41:21.509
Are you touched?

41:21.709 --> 41:22.909
It's probably all
that's keeping Michael

41:23.109 --> 41:24.949
and the rest of us
here alive.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.949
Why do you think the Batuks
even agreed to meet us?

41:27.109 --> 41:28.709
Because we already
paid them $2 million.

41:28.909 --> 41:30.789
Batuk doesn't need
$2 million.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.909
It's certainly not enough
to swallow the death of his son.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.029
The only reason they agreed
to meet us is they saw a chance

41:38.189 --> 41:41.389
to get back the money
that Eamon Cunningham owed them.

41:41.589 --> 41:44.989
As long as we're repaying
that debt, they'll leave us be.

41:45.149 --> 41:47.869
And how are we meant to repay
all that in four months?

41:48.029 --> 41:49.309
Amanda: With the next shipment
coming in,

41:49.509 --> 41:51.709
we'll have enough money
for the first payment.

41:51.869 --> 41:53.309
But we're gonna have to
increase revenue,

41:53.509 --> 41:56.469
and that will mean
expanding out of Dublin.

41:56.669 --> 41:58.749
That's not gonna
go down well.

41:58.989 --> 42:02.029
If Eamon Cunningham could supply
the whole country, so can we.

42:02.229 --> 42:03.189
No.

42:05.309 --> 42:06.949
You don't speak for me.

42:08.469 --> 42:11.549
You don't make deals
on my behalf.

42:11.749 --> 42:13.269
Not without even
asking me first.

42:13.509 --> 42:16.749
Fine. Alright, you tell us
how you'd sort out all this

42:16.909 --> 42:17.909
with the Batuks.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.349
And get Michael home.

42:19.509 --> 42:21.909
Not like this.

42:22.069 --> 42:23.149
How?

42:25.589 --> 42:27.349
You think you're
fuckin' smart now?

42:27.549 --> 42:29.909
You think you're real
fuckin' smart, don't you?

42:32.229 --> 42:33.909
You just wait.
That's enough, Eric.

42:46.109 --> 42:47.149
Footsteps depart

42:47.349 --> 42:48.709
Sighs

42:48.909 --> 42:51.509
What's gonna happen
when all this money gets paid?

42:51.669 --> 42:53.389
You think they're just gonna
leave us alone?

42:53.549 --> 42:54.949
I don't know.

42:55.149 --> 42:56.789
But this gives us four months
to work that out

42:56.989 --> 42:58.429
and decide
what we're gonna do.

42:58.589 --> 42:59.429
Mm.

43:21.669 --> 43:22.869
Where's your cousin?

43:22.989 --> 43:24.389
Uh, she's expecting a call,

43:24.589 --> 43:28.149
so she asked me
to speak to you.

43:28.389 --> 43:30.269
What happened
with Michael Kinsella?

43:30.469 --> 43:33.069
I'm still waiting on word back
from the lads I sent.

43:33.189 --> 43:34.509
But don't worry.

43:34.709 --> 43:37.589
If there's been a problem,
we'll get him next time.

43:37.709 --> 43:38.869
Okay.

43:43.309 --> 43:44.349
Grunts

43:53.589 --> 43:55.469
Vehicle door opens

43:57.909 --> 43:59.549
Engine starts

44:21.349 --> 44:24.669
Sighs
$90 million in four months?

44:26.149 --> 44:28.309
I don't see that
we have a choice.

44:28.469 --> 44:30.549
It's either that
or another war.

44:30.749 --> 44:31.709
Yeah.

44:31.829 --> 44:33.349
But if I'm to do this,

44:33.549 --> 44:36.909
I can't have Viking fucking up
things with his usual shit.

44:37.149 --> 44:39.189
He won't.
Sighs

44:39.389 --> 44:41.869
You know
what he's like.

44:42.029 --> 44:44.429
He'll calm down once he sees
everyone else is behind you.

44:44.589 --> 44:46.589
I hope so.

44:46.749 --> 44:48.189
We'll be fine.

44:50.669 --> 44:51.709
Trust me.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.909
Tires screech

45:09.149 --> 45:10.429
Kem.
Whistles

45:15.629 --> 45:17.309
Chuckles

45:17.509 --> 45:18.309
Car door closes

45:18.509 --> 45:19.789
-Hey.
-Yeah.

45:19.989 --> 45:21.389
Laughs

45:21.549 --> 45:23.069
Good to see you.

45:23.229 --> 45:24.869
-You good?
-Yeah.

45:25.029 --> 45:26.949
So, this is the sprog?

45:27.149 --> 45:28.389
Kem: Yeah.
Her name's Chloe.

45:28.509 --> 45:29.629
Ah.

45:31.989 --> 45:34.149
When does she stop
looking like a fuckin' troll?

45:36.349 --> 45:38.509
Laughing
I'm only messing with you.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.709
Here.

45:40.869 --> 45:42.869
That's for sorting
that other thing out for me.

45:43.069 --> 45:46.309
-Nikki already paid me for that.
-Yeah, it's a bonus...from me.

45:46.509 --> 45:49.469
To show how grateful
I am, yeah?

45:49.629 --> 45:51.749
Take it.

45:51.869 --> 45:53.069
Take it.

45:54.909 --> 45:56.229
Chuckles

45:56.429 --> 45:57.629
-My man.
-Thanks.

45:57.829 --> 46:00.549
And now that I'm out,
plenty more work for ya.

46:00.709 --> 46:03.109
Listen,
no disrespect, V,

46:03.309 --> 46:05.069
but with having Chloe now
and everything,

46:05.269 --> 46:06.789
I'm keeping
things clean.

46:09.109 --> 46:11.029
Exactly.

46:11.189 --> 46:13.989
You're a Da now,
you need to provide.

46:14.149 --> 46:15.789
And you don't want to be
bringing your daughter up

46:15.989 --> 46:17.709
in some
fuckin' shithole.

46:17.869 --> 46:19.909
So, stick with me

46:20.109 --> 46:23.389
and you'll be able
to treat her like a princess.

46:23.589 --> 46:25.589
Now look, I need
three or four lads

46:25.789 --> 46:27.869
you can vouch for,
straight away.

46:28.029 --> 46:30.509
There'll be lots of work.

46:30.669 --> 46:31.869
Amanda know about this?

46:32.029 --> 46:34.309
Fuck Amanda.
Trust me.

46:34.469 --> 46:36.349
There's big changes
coming to this family

46:36.549 --> 46:40.229
and she's the first
to get the fucking heave, eh?

46:40.389 --> 46:45.709
Oh, Kem, whoever you get,
they need to be handy, okay?

46:45.869 --> 46:46.749
Yeah.

46:46.949 --> 46:48.029
Good luck.

46:48.229 --> 46:50.469
Car door opens, closes

46:50.629 --> 46:52.309
Engine starts

47:03.789 --> 47:06.469
Door opens

47:20.389 --> 47:22.469
Door closes

47:22.669 --> 47:24.149
Hose spraying

47:32.069 --> 47:34.029
Vehicle approaching

47:39.549 --> 47:40.749
Trunk closes

48:02.989 --> 48:04.629
Are you alright?

48:04.869 --> 48:07.149
Car door closes
Yeah.

48:07.349 --> 48:08.909
You found me
a new place?

48:09.069 --> 48:10.549
There's no need.

48:10.749 --> 48:13.429
I've come
to bring you home.

48:13.549 --> 48:15.109
What about the Batuks?

48:15.269 --> 48:17.109
Amanda's done a deal
with them.

48:17.309 --> 48:20.069
That means it's safe
for you to come home.

48:20.229 --> 48:21.109
Really?

48:21.269 --> 48:23.469
Yeah.

48:23.629 --> 48:24.989
Oh, fuck.

48:29.349 --> 48:30.589
Fuck.

48:30.789 --> 48:32.869
Indistinct conversation

48:34.989 --> 48:36.709
Man: Can we have the next one,
please?

48:43.789 --> 48:47.429
Door closes
Prisoner number 45791.

48:51.789 --> 48:54.429
This board has assessed
your application

48:54.549 --> 48:56.069
and has taken into consideration

48:56.229 --> 48:58.549
the length of time you've served,

48:58.669 --> 49:02.269
your conduct while in prison,

49:02.469 --> 49:05.389
and, of course, the likelihood
that you pose a risk

49:05.589 --> 49:09.909
to the safety and security of
the public if you are released.

49:13.229 --> 49:16.949
And the Minister for Justice
has accepted our recommendations

49:17.109 --> 49:19.269
that you be granted parole.

49:19.469 --> 49:22.869
Brendan Kinsella,
you are free to go.
