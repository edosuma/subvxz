WEBVTT

00:02.940 --> 00:07.968
Ugh. A rainy day and a Monday...
Talk about a downer-double-whammy, huh?

00:09.814 --> 00:11.857
Do anything fun this weekend?

00:13.050 --> 00:14.484
Because I sure did.

00:14.552 --> 00:16.986
Friday night was Cornhole
League, then on Saturday...

00:17.054 --> 00:19.489
If I cared about
what you do on the weekend,

00:19.557 --> 00:23.737
I'd stick a shotgun in my mouth and
pull the trigger with my toes.

00:27.298 --> 00:29.833
Saturday I
watched a building burn down.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.801
Morning, Ms. Archer!

00:31.869 --> 00:35.673
It took all weekend, but I finally
got that payroll glitch sorted out.

00:35.793 --> 00:37.807
I said by five on Friday.

00:37.875 --> 00:40.777
Yeah sorry, the computer was
down, so over the weekend

00:40.845 --> 00:47.851
I had to punch all these cards by hand, and
then... carefully put them in order.

00:47.918 --> 00:50.520
Careful...
It's pretty delicate.

00:50.588 --> 00:52.622
Wow, and this is all marzipan?

00:52.690 --> 00:55.291
Yeah, except for the barn, that's
just graham crackers and icing.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.093
Well, your dad is gonna love it.

00:57.161 --> 01:01.231
I hope so. I mean, it's probably not
the best birthday present for a diabetic?

01:01.298 --> 01:05.135
Pam, those quarterly reports
better be on my desk when I walk in there.

01:05.256 --> 01:06.428
Are you...

01:06.548 --> 01:08.365
walking in there right now?

01:08.485 --> 01:09.754
What did I tell you on Friday?!

01:09.874 --> 01:12.063
I know, and I was gonna
come in this weekend,

01:12.183 --> 01:14.844
but I had to finish this so I
could get it in the mail today.

01:14.912 --> 01:16.024
Wrong answer.

01:19.617 --> 01:21.330
What the... shit?!

01:23.888 --> 01:27.257
- Hey, hey now, c'mon honey,
- It's just like when the

01:27.324 --> 01:30.193
farm flooded in real life!

01:30.261 --> 01:33.089
Only tiny and sweet!

01:33.631 --> 01:38.072
- Idiots. Surrounded by nothing but...
- What the hell is your problem?

01:38.192 --> 01:41.237
Finding your replacement,
missy, if you don't watch your tone!

01:41.305 --> 01:41.971
My tone? !!

01:42.039 --> 01:44.374
You watch your tone, you don't
speak to me like I'm some...

01:44.441 --> 01:45.241
Some what?!

01:45.309 --> 01:46.876
Balloon-breasted bimbo?!

01:46.944 --> 01:49.579
Always prancing around here in
those clingy little... whatever

01:49.647 --> 01:53.683
the hell they are, mini-sweater-dresses...
and your double-D push-up bras,

01:53.803 --> 01:58.654
so that all anyone can see, for miles
around, are your gigantic breasts!

02:01.525 --> 02:04.727
So...you wanna tell me
what's going on?

02:04.795 --> 02:07.063
No, I want you to get out.

02:07.131 --> 02:09.122
- Malory? Hey.
- I'm sorry, dear.

02:09.243 --> 02:12.702
I had a mammogram on Friday
and they...found something.

02:12.822 --> 02:14.971
Oh my God... Yeah.

02:15.039 --> 02:19.455
So...is that why yer bein'
such a bitch?

02:57.790 --> 03:01.424
- You both have to swear you won't breath
a word of this to anyone. - Totally.

03:01.544 --> 03:03.779
Yes. Especially Sterling.
If he found out...

03:03.899 --> 03:06.649
that I might have breast cancer,
he'd be devastated.

03:06.769 --> 03:10.151
So this information cannot leave this...
Pam, what the hell...

03:10.271 --> 03:11.216
What? Nothing.

03:11.456 --> 03:14.255
- You're texting about my...
- I'm not, I swear!

03:14.375 --> 03:16.058
- This is about...
- Breast cancer?!

03:16.178 --> 03:17.623
Oh, you poor thing!

03:17.743 --> 03:19.915
Pam!
What is wrong with you?

03:20.035 --> 03:22.299
I can't help it,
it's like a disease.

03:24.609 --> 03:25.269
Pam!

03:25.336 --> 03:27.271
Do you not know
what "disease" means?

03:27.338 --> 03:29.833
- Oh sorry, I forgot you might have...
- Breast cancer?!

03:29.953 --> 03:31.239
Oh for the love!

03:31.359 --> 03:33.163
And would you get off?!

03:33.283 --> 03:33.906
Breath?!

03:34.026 --> 03:37.714
Malory, if there's anything
we can do you just say the word!

03:37.782 --> 03:40.184
My entire laboratory
is at your disposal.

03:40.251 --> 03:42.810
Thanks, I'll let you know
if I need a...hybrid pigboy.

03:42.930 --> 03:44.788
A what? What are you...

03:44.856 --> 03:46.473
I don't have one of those!

03:50.928 --> 03:54.574
That'll do, Pigley...
That'll do.

03:57.129 --> 03:59.202
- Anymore, what're we talking about?
- Nothing.

03:59.322 --> 04:03.620
Because no one is to speak of this,
ever, and especially not to... Sterling!

04:03.740 --> 04:05.487
- Good morning, dear!
- Good morning.

04:05.607 --> 04:07.775
What's the big,
non-me-telling secret?

04:07.895 --> 04:10.004
Is there one?
At a spy agency?

04:10.086 --> 04:11.669
There's no secret dear,
we were just...

04:11.789 --> 04:14.195
Mother. Pardon me,
sorry, one second. Pam?

04:14.315 --> 04:16.086
No, you don't... Pam!

04:16.154 --> 04:17.620
- Pam.
- Pam!

04:17.689 --> 04:18.288
Pam.

04:18.356 --> 04:22.865
I'm okay I'm okay,
I'm good! I'm good...

04:25.162 --> 04:27.064
- Pam.
- Your mom's got breast cancer!

04:27.184 --> 04:28.725
She what? !?

04:28.845 --> 04:31.063
Damn her piggy little eyes!

04:31.183 --> 04:32.872
- Aww, Pigley...
- Mother?!

04:33.116 --> 04:34.594
Is this... Do you?

04:34.867 --> 04:36.441
Ugh...

04:36.561 --> 04:38.465
Oh, good God.

04:38.585 --> 04:40.876
You'd think he was a half fainting goat.

04:40.996 --> 04:42.529
Oh, Goatley.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.236
Well, actually men can develop

04:45.356 --> 04:47.682
breast cancer although it's extremely rare.

04:47.802 --> 04:49.099
Yeah. And also hereditary.

04:49.219 --> 04:50.906
So, thank you mother for that.

04:51.026 --> 04:55.428
Oh, there's a good chance your mother's
first mammogram was a false positive.

04:55.548 --> 04:59.899
I'll know for sure after I get
the results of her diagnostic exam, but...

05:00.019 --> 05:01.638
I've got a good feeling about her.

05:01.758 --> 05:03.470
And the feeling is mutual, doctor.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.250
Hey, can you not...right now...

05:05.370 --> 05:07.188
There's several other risk factors for

05:07.308 --> 05:09.750
male breast cancer, such as

05:09.870 --> 05:12.153
any history of alcoholism.

05:12.273 --> 05:14.714
- You know, I mean I drink socially, but...
- Hah!

05:15.890 --> 05:17.699
I didn't have breakfast.

05:17.971 --> 05:21.000
Any unusual exposure to radiation...

05:21.380 --> 05:24.983
Um...
Wait, seriously don't open it?

05:25.103 --> 05:28.262
- Yeah.
- Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic.

05:31.986 --> 05:32.948
Looking for this?

05:33.068 --> 05:36.825
Or perhaps the lead container I
probably should've left it in?

05:37.629 --> 05:41.627
So wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's good cholesterol?

05:41.965 --> 05:43.084
Mmmnope.

05:43.204 --> 05:45.697
Well, then a
little dose won't hurt.

05:46.844 --> 05:50.380
Doctor, I have
Ms. Archer's results...

05:50.448 --> 05:52.649
Well if it isn't Chet Manley!

05:52.717 --> 05:54.922
Yeah, and is it...
I wanna say Peggy?

05:55.042 --> 05:56.770
Rita!
And you said you'd call me!

05:56.890 --> 05:58.300
Really?
To both statements?

05:58.420 --> 05:59.156
Hello?!

05:59.276 --> 06:02.062
If it's not too much trouble I'd
like to know if I have cancer!

06:02.182 --> 06:05.119
The first test
was a false positive.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.520
You're totally fine.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.583
Wh-? Oh thank God!

06:07.703 --> 06:10.359
Yeah good.
Hey, wanna grab a drink later?

06:11.996 --> 06:12.455
Peggy?

06:12.575 --> 06:14.319
I can't believe
it, it's such a relief!

06:14.439 --> 06:16.075
I don't have breast cancer!

06:16.195 --> 06:17.769
So, guess we can
skip all this, huh?

06:17.889 --> 06:21.289
Well we're here, machine's
on, may as well take a look.

06:21.409 --> 06:22.646
So, if you could...?

06:22.714 --> 06:25.064
- Hm? Oh, sorry...
- Wow.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.387
Wow what, what
is wow, what is that?

06:27.507 --> 06:31.521
Thaaat...
Yeah that's breast cancer.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.867
- What?!
- What?!

06:32.987 --> 06:36.455
Yeah. So listen...
Wanna grab a drink later?

06:40.641 --> 06:42.928
Yep.
Stage Two breast cancer...

06:45.211 --> 06:48.081
Yeah, I mean
it's not as bad as Stage Three or Four,

06:48.201 --> 06:52.169
but it's not, ya know, obviously
not as good as no cancer.

06:52.289 --> 06:53.513
God, I should
definitely get checked.

06:53.633 --> 06:56.117
I'm so bad about
doing the self-exam.

06:56.185 --> 06:58.460
Hey, how about we
check each other?!

06:59.665 --> 07:04.359
- So what's next, do you do chemo, or...
- A lumpectomy.

07:04.427 --> 07:08.930
I go in for surgery next week, and
they'll try to cut it all out...

07:08.998 --> 07:10.801
If they can't get it all, or
if it spreads to my lymph

07:10.921 --> 07:13.735
nodes, then they'll do chemo,
but I'm trying to stay

07:13.803 --> 07:16.332
positive, cause I can beat this.

07:17.711 --> 07:20.649
Wow, you seem kinda...
different.

07:20.769 --> 07:22.043
Yeah, did I
mention I have cancer?

07:22.111 --> 07:24.103
Not that, dick,
your whole outlook.

07:24.223 --> 07:26.270
All this...
positivity and whatever.

07:26.306 --> 07:27.582
I have to be positive.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.017
Gotta stay strong.

07:29.085 --> 07:30.771
So here, show some support.

07:32.955 --> 07:34.389
Here, Brett, take a ribbon.

07:34.457 --> 07:36.191
- What is this?
- Pink ribbon.

07:36.258 --> 07:37.025
I have breast cancer.

07:37.093 --> 07:38.426
Ha ha! Seriously?

07:38.494 --> 07:39.194
Breast cancer?

07:39.261 --> 07:41.974
- Yes...
- Sure it's not lady vagina cancer?

07:43.884 --> 07:45.233
Excuse me.

07:45.301 --> 07:47.102
I'm trying! To stay positive!

07:47.169 --> 07:49.804
Both mentally! And spiritually!

07:49.872 --> 07:50.505
Brett!

07:50.573 --> 07:52.641
Well he certainly doesn't
have cancer in his fists.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.142
He's beating his ass.

07:54.210 --> 07:56.478
Now, if you all will
excuse me again,

07:56.545 --> 08:00.531
I'm going to spend some quality time
with those who are dear to me.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.317
Brett.

08:05.121 --> 08:07.927
Yeah hey it's got a safety pin!

08:08.171 --> 08:09.024
What?!

08:09.091 --> 08:11.026
Breast cancer,
and yes, seriously.

08:11.093 --> 08:14.062
And I dunno how it's gonna turn
out, so I wanted to, ya know...

08:14.130 --> 08:16.873
spend some time with
the wee baby Seamus.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.101
He's not even yer real kid.

08:20.169 --> 08:21.421
- So?
- So it's weird.

08:21.541 --> 08:23.405
So is me paying you
child support, Trinette,

08:23.472 --> 08:25.006
but you keep cashing the checks!

08:25.074 --> 08:28.443
I'm sorry. C'mon Trinette,
Seamus may not be my son,

08:28.511 --> 08:31.646
but he's probably as close
as I'm ever gonna get.

08:31.714 --> 08:33.727
Where're you taking him?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.184
I dunno... what's he into?

08:36.304 --> 08:40.488
Oh, that is just classic him...
I mean my God, I was the one who...

08:40.556 --> 08:42.657
Was getting all the attention?

08:42.725 --> 08:44.670
Who thought I had breast cancer.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.665
Shut up! And now he has it and

08:46.785 --> 08:48.744
it's all Sterling this and ribbons that!

08:48.864 --> 08:52.654
- Well he does actually have cancer...
- Well he didn't get it from me!

08:52.655 --> 08:53.703
CHERYL/CAROL Wh-?!

08:53.823 --> 08:55.325
It's contagious?!

08:55.445 --> 08:57.138
What the shit?!

08:57.206 --> 09:00.008
I know, I'm not
normally a tattoo guy, but...

09:00.076 --> 09:01.676
Not yours, shitbrain!

09:01.744 --> 09:03.136
His!

09:03.395 --> 09:05.746
Yeah it's like, we've
got each other's backs.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.482
Right?

09:07.550 --> 09:10.051
You can't tattoo a frickin baby!

09:10.119 --> 09:11.572
That's what the tattoo guy said.

09:11.692 --> 09:13.288
Had to slip him an
extra hundred bucks.

09:13.355 --> 09:15.056
How bout I slip
somebody a hundred bucks to...

09:15.124 --> 09:16.791
throw acid in your face?!

09:16.859 --> 09:20.261
Costs more than
that, I bet to buy acid, Trinette.

09:20.329 --> 09:21.629
C'mon, Seamus!

09:21.697 --> 09:24.047
- I hope your stupid cancer kills you.
- Oh yeah?!

09:24.167 --> 09:27.076
Well I hope... it doesn't!

09:27.658 --> 09:31.239
And to that end
Woodhouse, macrobiotic food.

09:31.307 --> 09:33.316
Find out what that is
and start cooking it.

09:33.436 --> 09:37.953
Oh, and smoothies, and... and why
are you dressed like a tout?

09:38.073 --> 09:40.241
My vacation starts today, sir.

09:40.361 --> 09:43.752
What?! I'm riddled with cancer and
you wanna take a vacation?!

09:43.819 --> 09:46.621
No, but I asked
for the time off a year ago,

09:46.689 --> 09:50.291
and Dicky and I've been planning
this trip ever since, and...

09:50.359 --> 09:50.912
Who's Dicky?

09:51.032 --> 09:52.281
- My brother.
- What?

09:52.401 --> 09:53.156
He's younger.

09:53.276 --> 09:54.104
Obviously.

09:54.224 --> 09:57.966
And we've always dreamed of
someday going to Las Vegas together,

09:58.033 --> 10:02.676
so we saved up and got a lovely package,
and it's prepaid, you see, so...

10:02.796 --> 10:04.630
- Prepaid, huh?
- Yessir.

10:06.876 --> 10:08.350
Did I mention I have cancer?

10:33.869 --> 10:35.335
God, what a trip...

10:35.455 --> 10:38.378
Barely got back in time for surgery
tomorrow. You shoulda been there.

10:38.498 --> 10:41.839
Yes, God knows when I'll
be able to see Dickie again.

10:42.694 --> 10:45.106
- Or where.
- Yeah, Mexico is pretty big.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.163
- So is your heart, Woodhouse.
- Sir?

10:48.283 --> 10:50.316
That's probably the nicest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

10:50.436 --> 10:53.045
- Oh, well...
- I'm serious, you know,

10:53.165 --> 10:55.616
you showed me how important
family is and you're...

10:56.529 --> 11:00.002
kind of family and I know I'm not
always as nice to you as I could be, so...

11:00.122 --> 11:02.485
I'm gonna work on that, okay?

11:02.605 --> 11:04.748
Yessir.
Thank you, sir.

11:04.868 --> 11:05.753
Thank you.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.358
Toilet's clogged.

11:10.157 --> 11:14.175
And so I wanted to say I'm sorry
Pam, if there were ever any times

11:14.243 --> 11:16.544
- when I was less than nice to you...
- Huh!

11:16.612 --> 11:19.214
[BLEEP] your [BEEP] dolphin, Pam!

11:19.281 --> 11:23.418
And I definitely could've been
nicer to you, Ca... Cheryl...

11:26.586 --> 11:27.404
Yeah.

11:27.524 --> 11:30.074
Here, take
two, and... Brett!

11:30.194 --> 11:31.359
Where's that ribbon, buddy?

11:31.427 --> 11:32.727
Gonna go put it on right now!

11:32.795 --> 11:35.816
Okay, then come see me, I
got some mid-range scotch for you!

11:36.074 --> 11:36.887
You not...

11:37.007 --> 11:38.127
Oh hey, and where's Cyril?

11:38.247 --> 11:39.580
Extradited?!

11:39.910 --> 11:42.537
But I've never even
been to Las Vegas!

11:42.605 --> 11:47.074
Oh you gotta go, it's amaze...
zing I hear, but I've never been.

11:47.562 --> 11:48.567
- Here.
- What're ya doin?!

11:48.687 --> 11:50.311
He can't have booze,
he's going to jail!

11:50.379 --> 11:52.213
C'mon. I have cancer.

11:52.281 --> 11:53.479
Of the tits!

11:54.111 --> 11:55.917
Yeah, okay, give him the booze.

11:55.985 --> 11:57.218
Jesus, I should get checked.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.164
Can somebody water my plants?!

11:59.284 --> 12:00.772
Yes!

12:01.160 --> 12:02.021
No.

12:02.141 --> 12:05.319
Yes! Mother c'mon, they said
I could eat and drink til midnight.

12:05.439 --> 12:06.453
Alcohol?!

12:06.573 --> 12:09.281
Uh, the stuff they
use to sterilize hospitals?

12:09.401 --> 12:11.175
Pretty sure it's okay.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.999
Here's to uh... family, I guess.

12:14.119 --> 12:18.601
I'm... sorry if I've been a
bit selfish about your breast cancer.

12:18.721 --> 12:23.319
And I'm sorry if I haven't always
been, um...ya know, whatever.

12:23.439 --> 12:25.357
Well, you do the best you can.

12:26.315 --> 12:27.960
Eh.

12:28.778 --> 12:29.869
Are you scared?

12:29.989 --> 12:31.247
I am, actually.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.582
Me too.

12:32.702 --> 12:36.257
Sterling, I... well.

12:36.325 --> 12:38.151
Yeah, me too, Mother.

12:39.055 --> 12:41.387
Wow, it's kinda weird opening
up like this, huh?

12:41.507 --> 12:43.167
Yeah, gimme another belt.

12:44.232 --> 12:47.635
- There's so much I still wanna do...
- Oh, now...

12:47.703 --> 12:48.870
you're gonna be fine.

12:48.938 --> 12:52.055
- ARCHER Like, I've never been to Rome...
- Wh-? Yes you have.

12:52.175 --> 12:53.749
For wooork, mother.

12:53.869 --> 12:57.345
Sterling Malory Archer,
this surgery is going to work,

12:57.413 --> 13:00.848
and you... look at me... you
are going to beat cancer.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.185
B-but what if I dooon't?

13:02.305 --> 13:04.480
So uh... How's this goin?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.920
Not great.

13:05.988 --> 13:07.775
Lanaaaa...
Lana what if I dooon't?

13:08.205 --> 13:10.100
Can you take him home?

13:11.349 --> 13:12.454
Um... can you not?

13:12.574 --> 13:16.416
No, if I don't get something
to eat I'm literally going to die.

13:16.536 --> 13:20.119
- I seriously might though.
- Ugh, you're gonna be fine.

13:20.239 --> 13:23.868
What if I'm not, what if
I die, then have to live with the fact

13:23.988 --> 13:26.336
I was a dick to you
like, a jillion times?

13:26.456 --> 13:29.290
- Look, don't worry about it, just...
- Lana I'm in love with you.

13:31.647 --> 13:33.498
- You're also shit-faced.
- I can be both.

13:33.618 --> 13:37.992
And I might die tomorrow, so I really
don't think I should be alone tonight.

13:38.112 --> 13:40.699
- Newp.
- Did I mention I have cancer?

13:45.327 --> 13:46.409
Awesome.

13:55.021 --> 13:58.922
Archer. Archer.

14:01.628 --> 14:02.828
Waagh!

14:02.896 --> 14:04.763
What the shit, Lana?!

14:04.831 --> 14:05.997
- Wait, Lana?!
- Yeah.

14:06.117 --> 14:08.300
ARCHER Wait, why are you in my...
Aw, shit!

14:08.368 --> 14:09.735
My cancer surgery!

14:09.803 --> 14:10.936
Yeah.

14:11.004 --> 14:12.268
So listen.

14:12.388 --> 14:14.540
- About last night...
- Don't worry about it, just...

14:14.608 --> 14:19.678
No wait, we should talk about...
whatever's in this IV, which I love...

14:19.746 --> 14:22.314
We can talk after your surgery.

14:22.382 --> 14:26.285
- Mm-hmm...
- Or never, probably, knowing you.

14:26.353 --> 14:27.319
Where's Mother?!

14:27.387 --> 14:28.954
Sterling?

14:29.022 --> 14:29.802
Was that him?!

14:29.922 --> 14:30.723
Yeah, where were you?

14:30.790 --> 14:33.025
- The cafeteria...
- Bear claws, rrowr!

14:33.093 --> 14:34.860
I've been here since six!

14:34.928 --> 14:37.396
He was four hours late
to his own surgery!

14:37.464 --> 14:39.565
LANA Yeah, kind of a...
late night.

14:39.633 --> 14:42.568
- And speaking of...
- I spent last night in the Tombs,

14:42.636 --> 14:45.004
getting worked over by the cops!

14:45.071 --> 14:46.698
Huh? What for?
I mean literally.

14:46.818 --> 14:48.812
Yeah, until the Las Vegas police

14:48.932 --> 14:50.743
faxed over this little gem!

14:50.810 --> 14:53.162
Ha ha ha!

14:54.195 --> 14:55.545
Too soon?

14:57.751 --> 15:01.352
Oh my God...
How much cancer was in him?!

15:01.472 --> 15:06.087
This is so boring and
forever-taking.

15:06.207 --> 15:09.332
For the 55th time shut up
and go back to the office.

15:09.452 --> 15:12.498
- No I wanna be here, in case he...
- Don't.

15:12.566 --> 15:14.800
Dies.

15:14.868 --> 15:16.201
What, we're all thinking it!

15:16.269 --> 15:17.436
No we're not!

15:17.504 --> 15:21.574
This surgery is going to be a complete
success, and Sterling is going to be

15:21.641 --> 15:22.808
completely cured.

15:22.876 --> 15:24.682
- Hooray...
- Oh shut up.

15:25.184 --> 15:28.681
LANA Although... he has been a lot
nicer ever since he was diagnosed.

15:28.748 --> 15:29.815
Oh really?

15:29.883 --> 15:32.606
Ha ha ha!

15:32.922 --> 15:35.187
Ahem. Still too soon.

15:35.255 --> 15:37.556
Not too soon
for good news I hope!

15:37.624 --> 15:41.167
Oh, and also some very bad news.

15:42.596 --> 15:44.063
What's the bad news?!

15:44.130 --> 15:46.432
I have to take a
raincheck on that drink.

15:46.499 --> 15:47.933
I'm on call this weekend.

15:48.001 --> 15:50.269
MALORY Wh-?!
What about Sterling? ! Ass!

15:50.337 --> 15:51.852
- Oh right, that's the good news.
- What are you, hourly?

15:51.972 --> 15:56.842
Thanks to me the surgery was totally
successful, and now Mr. Archer is...

15:56.910 --> 15:59.845
Totally cancer-free!

15:59.913 --> 16:01.543
Whoooo!

16:01.663 --> 16:03.897
I beat cancer, everybody.

16:04.017 --> 16:06.852
Oh Sterling, I
knew you could do it!

16:06.920 --> 16:08.354
Yeah, so...
is that why you didn't even

16:08.421 --> 16:09.189
bother to see me off to surgery?

16:09.309 --> 16:12.391
Wh-? You were four hours
late, we grabbed a bear claw!

16:12.459 --> 16:13.025
Rrowr.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.706
No, it's fine Mother, whatever.

16:14.826 --> 16:16.209
Hey, how're you doing?
I beat cancer.

16:16.329 --> 16:16.695
MALORY Wh-?!

16:16.763 --> 16:18.545
Looks like he's
back to his old self.

16:18.665 --> 16:21.305
- Oh, let's hope not...
- Hello?!

16:21.425 --> 16:24.637
Uh, there's this great new
thing, called coasters?!

16:24.704 --> 16:26.071
Sorry! Jeez!

16:26.139 --> 16:29.642
Don't apologize to me,
apologize to the Brazilian rosewood.

16:29.709 --> 16:30.409
Ugh.

16:30.477 --> 16:33.579
- So listen, about last night...
- Lana hey,

16:33.647 --> 16:35.881
I know you probably think it
was just because I was drunk,

16:35.949 --> 16:37.216
Well, and scared.

16:37.283 --> 16:38.951
- Well, more drunk.
- And super scared. - Not really scared.

16:39.019 --> 16:40.819
But the thing is... Woodhouse!

16:40.887 --> 16:42.421
Answer the damn phone!

16:42.489 --> 16:43.155
Archer residence.

16:43.223 --> 16:45.858
So, the thing is...
here's the thing.

16:45.925 --> 16:46.892
It's for you, sir.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.193
Duh. One sec.

16:48.261 --> 16:49.161
Talk to me!

16:49.229 --> 16:51.658
Mr. Archer?
Hi, it's Doctor Spelts.

16:51.778 --> 16:56.416
- Who?
- I did your cancer surgery?

16:56.536 --> 16:57.503
Like, two hours ago?

16:57.570 --> 17:00.305
Oh right, listen, I'm
kinda celebrating right now,

17:00.373 --> 17:03.175
You may want to...
hold off on that?

17:03.243 --> 17:04.410
What?

17:04.477 --> 17:07.180
Yeah, I should've waited until
your post-op results came in...

17:07.300 --> 17:07.897
What?!

17:08.018 --> 17:10.115
But I could tell
your mom was already crushed

17:10.183 --> 17:12.917
about the raincheck thing,
So what are you saying?

17:12.986 --> 17:14.195
- Archer?
- Sterling?

17:14.316 --> 17:18.435
What was I saying? Oh yeah,
the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes.

17:18.556 --> 17:19.806
What does that mean?

17:19.925 --> 17:22.623
Well it's not good,
obviously, so...

17:22.742 --> 17:24.905
- Sterling, what did he say?
- The cancer...

17:25.483 --> 17:27.933
It's in my lymph nodes.

17:28.001 --> 17:31.680
- Holy shitsnacks...
- What's cancer?

17:33.073 --> 17:36.742
Yeah, so...I guess this party
was a little premature, huh?

17:36.810 --> 17:40.679
Sterling, there's radiation
treatment, there's chemotherapy, there's...

17:40.747 --> 17:42.630
Well, I think just those two
things, but...

17:42.750 --> 17:43.786
But you can still be cured!

17:43.906 --> 17:49.054
- This isn't, ya know... um...good, but...
- Excuse me...

17:49.122 --> 17:52.157
- That was the best you could do?
- Shut up.

17:52.225 --> 17:53.058
What'd I expect?

17:53.126 --> 17:55.394
Jesus, look at how I've
treated all of you!

17:55.462 --> 17:58.030
Carol, and Pam... and Cyril!

17:58.098 --> 18:00.966
Oh my God listen, I'm gonna
clear up this Vegas thing!

18:01.034 --> 18:03.802
Great, all you have to do
is go down to the police station

18:03.870 --> 18:05.765
- and confess...
- Or something, maybe else, but...

18:05.885 --> 18:07.574
That's actually the only thing.

18:07.694 --> 18:13.011
Woodhouse! Woodhouse, salt of
the earth, who basically raised me!

18:13.079 --> 18:14.574
- Well...
- And you helped, Mother!

18:14.694 --> 18:15.579
I know that!

18:15.699 --> 18:16.521
And Lana!

18:16.641 --> 18:19.685
Lana, I want you to know that
what I said last... Woodhouse,

18:19.753 --> 18:21.122
seriously, a little help here?

18:21.554 --> 18:23.503
Archer residence.

18:23.623 --> 18:24.321
For you, sir.

18:24.441 --> 18:25.958
Was that so hard?

18:26.025 --> 18:27.326
Lana, sorry, gimme one second.

18:27.393 --> 18:29.571
Because I really want you
to hear what I have to say.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.380
- Hello?
- Mr. Archer?

18:31.500 --> 18:32.959
Hi, Doctor Spelts again.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.527
Yeah listen, I'm kinda
making peace with my loved ones,

18:36.647 --> 18:38.875
- uh, plus some other people right now, so...
- You may want

18:38.995 --> 18:40.199
- to hold off on that...
- What?

18:40.319 --> 18:42.489
Because, boy, did I pull a boner.

18:42.609 --> 18:45.110
Said the urologist,
ba-dump-bump, anyhoo,

18:45.178 --> 18:48.213
turns out I mixed up your
chart with another patient's.

18:48.281 --> 18:49.726
What?
Wait are... are you sure?!

18:49.846 --> 18:51.950
Of course I'm sure, I'm a doctor.

18:52.018 --> 18:57.078
- And I can say, positively, you are...
- Totally cancer-free!

18:57.198 --> 18:59.691
Again!

18:59.759 --> 19:01.193
Whooo! Suck it, cancer!

19:01.261 --> 19:03.827
Cyril, I don't wanna see you
with an empty glass again, okay?

19:03.947 --> 19:05.997
Yeah, so, about my Vegas problem.

19:06.117 --> 19:08.452
Yeah, the Vegas problem.
I've been giving it a lot of though,

19:08.572 --> 19:11.318
and I'm pretty sure...
Mother feel free to chime in here.

19:11.438 --> 19:13.227
And I'm pretty sure ISIS...

19:13.347 --> 19:15.676
can get you a whole new identity,
Cyril.

19:15.796 --> 19:19.072
- Oh, you can use one of my old ones.
- I don't want to use it.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.237
You're Chett Manly now.
How about that?

19:21.357 --> 19:22.978
- I don't wanna be Chett Manly.
- Everybody!

19:23.098 --> 19:25.203
Say hello to my friend, Chett Manly.

19:25.323 --> 19:28.673
- Hi. - Not a new person.
- Shut up I saw him first.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.671
Speaking of being a new person,

19:30.791 --> 19:33.199
or not...
Did you wanna tell me something?

19:35.139 --> 19:37.209
- Did I?
- Like 4 minutes ago,

19:37.329 --> 19:38.720
when you thought you were dying?

19:38.840 --> 19:41.505
Oh, yeah. Lana, so,
here's the thing.

19:52.397 --> 19:54.879
I got it!

19:55.648 --> 19:56.315
Hello?

19:56.382 --> 19:57.443
May I speak to Chet?

19:57.563 --> 20:02.254
Oh my God...Yeah hang on,
he's right...Wait, who is this?

20:02.322 --> 20:02.975
- Rita.
- Who?

20:03.095 --> 20:03.794
The nurse?

20:04.497 --> 20:05.516
Redhead?!

20:07.511 --> 20:09.161
- Peggy.
- Ohhh!

20:09.229 --> 20:11.288
Yeah hey, this is Chet...

20:11.408 --> 20:13.384
Hang on, Peggy, I got another call...

20:13.901 --> 20:15.087
- Talk to me!
- Mr. Archer?

20:15.207 --> 20:18.182
- This is Dr. Spelts.
- I know. What, doctor?

20:18.302 --> 20:21.126
Well, you are just gonna kill me...

20:21.246 --> 20:24.209
But turns out I was
right the first time.

20:24.277 --> 20:26.845
The first time,
you said I was cured!

20:26.913 --> 20:28.308
Wait, now I'm confused.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.115
At the hospital!

20:30.183 --> 20:33.744
