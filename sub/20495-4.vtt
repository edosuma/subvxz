05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
Lemonis: THIS BUSINESS

05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
WOULD BE BEST DESCRIBED

05:14.999 --> 05:18.999
AS A LOT OF PERSONALITY

05:14.999 --> 05:18.999
AND NOT A LOT OF PROCESS.

05:20.999 --> 05:21.999
Sammy: SO, THAT'S THE TEXAN.

05:21.999 --> 05:24.999
YOU HAVE BACON.

05:21.999 --> 05:24.999
YOU HAVE FRIED ONION RING,

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
LETTUCE, BARBECUE SAUCE,

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
AMERICAN CHEESE, AND CHEDDAR.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
Lemonis:

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
WHICH IS -- WHICH IS THIS ONE?

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
Tranchina:

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
THAT'S THE DOUBLE STANDARD.

05:30.999 --> 05:31.999
IT'S BASICALLY

05:30.999 --> 05:31.999
A DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
-Lemonis: WHAT'S IN HERE?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
-Sammy: THAT IS THE OMG BURGER.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.999
JALAPEÑOS, AMERICAN CHEESE,

05:33.999 --> 05:36.999
CRUNCHY ONIONS,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.999
AND YOU HAVE PLANTAINS.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.999
Lemonis: HONESTLY, I WOULD SAY

05:38.999 --> 05:41.999
THE BURGERS ARE AVERAGE.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
[ Chuckling ] I MEAN,

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.999
THESE BURGERS

05:44.000 --> 05:46.999
AND THE MENU CONCOCTIONS --

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
THEY SOUND LIKE COLLEGE-CAMPUS

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
DRUNK-BURGER CONCOCTIONS.

05:49.999 --> 05:50.999
Sammy: WE'D BE PAINTING A WALL

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
AND TALKING ABOUT,

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
"HEY, LET'S DO A BRUNCH BURGER.

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
LET'S DO A BURGER

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
WITH A FRIED EGG ON IT."

05:54.999 --> 05:58.999
Lemonis:

05:54.999 --> 05:58.999
"ALL RIGHT, GREAT IDEA. SOUNDS

05:54.999 --> 05:58.999
AWESOME. THROW ME ANOTHER BEER."

05:58.999 --> 05:59.999
Tranchina:

05:58.999 --> 05:59.999
KIND OF, SORT OF, YOU KNOW.

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
Lemonis: SO, MOST CHEFS,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.999
IF THEY'RE CREATING A MULTITUDE

06:01.000 --> 06:02.999
OF BURGERS,

06:02.999 --> 06:03.999
THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
HOW THE FLAVORS INTERACT

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
WITH EACH OTHER.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
THERE'S NO

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
SORT OF ART AND SCIENCE.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.999
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A HIGHER-END

06:07.999 --> 06:10.999
BURGER ESTABLISHMENT

06:10.999 --> 06:13.999
THAT'S ALL FRESH INGREDIENTS

06:10.999 --> 06:13.999
AND INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT IT

06:13.999 --> 06:16.999
THAT MAKE THE BURGERS DIFFERENT

06:13.999 --> 06:16.999
OR THE FRIES DIFFERENT.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.999
WHAT I REALLY WALKED INTO

06:16.999 --> 06:19.999
WAS A BURGER JOINT.

06:21.999 --> 06:22.999
RED VELVET SHAKE.

06:22.999 --> 06:23.999
-YOU GUYS MAKE THOSE?

06:22.999 --> 06:23.999
-Todd: YES.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
Lemonis:

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
SO, ARE SHAKES A BIG DEAL HERE?

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
-Todd: YES.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
-Lemonis: ARE THEY GOOD MARGINS?

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
Todd: YES.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE OUR SHAKES.

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
Lemonis:

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
FOR EVERY BURGER THAT YOU SELL,

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
HOW MANY SHAKES

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
ARE YOU ATTACHING?

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
Todd: PROBABLY OUT OF

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
EVERY THREE OR FOUR ORDERS,

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
THERE'S A SHAKE IN THERE.

06:35.999 --> 06:38.999
-Lemonis: SO, A 25% ATTACHMENT?

06:35.999 --> 06:38.999
-Todd: PROBABLY.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
Lemonis: AND WHAT IS

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
THE PERCENTAGE OF ATTACHMENT

06:40.999 --> 06:42.999
FOR FRIES TO AN ORDER?

06:42.999 --> 06:43.999
Sammy: ALMOST 80%.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
Lemonis:

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
LOOK, IN A BUSINESS LIKE THIS,

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT THE

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
MONEY IS MADE IN THE BURGER.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
IT'S MADE IN OTHER THINGS.

06:50.999 --> 06:51.999
IN THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS,

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
TO BE MADE

06:53.999 --> 06:57.999
WITH FRENCH FRIES AND ICE CREAM,

06:53.999 --> 06:57.999
WHERE THE MARGINS ARE 85%.

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
THE GOAL IS MAKING SURE

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
THAT YOU ATTACH THOSE THINGS

07:00.999 --> 07:03.999
TO AS MANY BURGER ORDERS

07:00.999 --> 07:03.999
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
THAT'S WHERE

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
THE MONEY'S GONNA GET MADE.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
DO YOU GUYS HAVE A --

07:06.999 --> 07:09.000
LIKE, AN EXTRA-LARGE BLACK

07:06.999 --> 07:09.000
T-SHIRT OR A RED T-SHIRT?

07:09.999 --> 07:10.999
I WANT TO PUT A T-SHIRT ON.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
Sammy: TODD, I THINK THEY'RE

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR, TODD.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
Lemonis: I WANT TO WORK

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
IN THE KITCHEN WITH YOU GUYS.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.999
Young Man:

07:15.000 --> 07:16.999
YOU WANT RED OR BLACK?

07:16.999 --> 07:18.999
Lemonis:

07:16.999 --> 07:18.999
UH...WHERE'D YOU GET THEM FROM?

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
Covello:

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
THEY WERE IN TODD'S TRUNK.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
Todd: WELL, WE HAVE

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
NOWHERE TO STORE THEM, SO WE...

07:21.999 --> 07:24.999
Lemonis: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

07:21.999 --> 07:24.999
YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO STORE THEM?

07:24.999 --> 07:25.999
WHAT ABOUT THE OFFICE?

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
Tranchina: TODD BELIEVES

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
THAT THEY TAKE THEM

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
AND BRING THEM HOME

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
AND GIVE THEM TO THEIR FRIENDS.

07:29.999 --> 07:30.999
Todd: THEY USED TO DISAPPEAR,

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
AND THEY USED TO

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
WALK OUT THE DOOR.

07:31.999 --> 07:32.999
Sammy: SO, AT THAT POINT,

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE WALKING

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
OUT THE DOOR WITH THEM.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
Tranchina: WE ALSO

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
ONLY GIVE AN EMPLOYEE ONE SHIRT

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
AND EXPECT HIM

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
TO WEAR IT FIVE DAYS A WEEK

07:38.999 --> 07:40.999
WHEN HE WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
Lemonis:

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
THESE GUYS CAN'T GET ALONG,

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
AND WHAT I'VE SEEN

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
IS A LOT OF DYSFUNCTION.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
I MEAN,

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
IT'S NO WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
WHO CAME UP

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
WITH THE RED VELVET IDEA?

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
Sammy: SO, MY BROTHER, FUJI,

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
HELPED ME DESIGN THE DESIGN

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
THE WHOLE BURGER PLACE.

07:52.999 --> 07:53.999
Lemonis: AND WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

07:53.999 --> 07:54.999
Sammy: THE ARGUMENTS, MARCUS.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
Lemonis:

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM OR...

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
Sammy:

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
NO. BETWEEN TODD AND HIM.

07:57.999 --> 08:01.999
IT CAME TO A POINT WHERE THEY

07:57.999 --> 08:01.999
WERE WATCHING THE CAMERAS 24/7.

08:01.999 --> 08:02.999
Lemonis: WHAT CAMERAS?

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
Sammy:

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
THE CAMERAS IN THE RESTAURANT.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
THEY WERE

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
WATCHING THEM FROM HOME,

08:06.999 --> 08:07.999
AND HE WOULD GET A PHONE CALL --

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
"WHY IS THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
OPEN?" YOU KNOW?

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
AND HE COULDN'T

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
TAKE THE PRESSURE ANYMORE.

08:11.999 --> 08:12.999
HE COULDN'T.

08:11.999 --> 08:12.999
AND HE WALKED AWAY.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
WHEN WE LOST MY BROTHER, MARCUS,

08:14.999 --> 08:16.000
WE REALLY LOST

08:14.999 --> 08:16.000
THE SENSE OF A CHEF HERE.

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
Todd: HIS BROTHER

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
DOESN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE

08:17.999 --> 08:20.999
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL

08:17.999 --> 08:20.999
HAD ISSUES WITH HIM.

08:20.999 --> 08:23.999
Lemonis: DID HE WORK? DID HE

08:20.999 --> 08:23.999
COME IN EARLY AND STAY LATE?

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
Tranchina: HE LIVED HERE.

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
HE WAS LIKE HAVING YOU HERE

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
Todd: FUJI CAN GET THE JOB DONE.

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU NEED

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
TO GIVE HIM THAT DIRECTION.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
Sammy: MICROMANAGING.

08:32.999 --> 08:35.999
THEY WILL MICROMANAGE YOU TILL

08:32.999 --> 08:35.999
THEY SNAP YOUR NECK, LITERALLY.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
Lemonis: WHO WILL?

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
Sammy: TODD IN GENERAL.

08:38.999 --> 08:39.999
Todd:

08:38.999 --> 08:39.999
"TODD DOES THIS. TODD DOES THAT.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
TODD TAKES THE SHIRTS.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
TODD DOES ANYTHING."

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
-Sammy: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
-Covello: THERE WAS TIMES

08:43.999 --> 08:46.999
WHERE THE STORE WASN'T OPEN

08:43.999 --> 08:46.999
UNTIL 1:00 IN THE AFTERNOON

08:46.999 --> 08:47.999
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T OPEN IT.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
Tranchina: FUJI WAS HERE

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
DEVELOPING SAUCES,

08:49.999 --> 08:51.999
COMING UP WITH IDEAS, STAYING

08:49.999 --> 08:51.999
TILL 1:00 IN THE MORNING,

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
SCRUBBING THE FLOOR

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
WITH TOOTHBRUSHES.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
Lemonis: LOOK, DEPENDING ON

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
WHO YOU LISTEN TO,

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
SAMMY'S BROTHER, FUJI,

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
IS EITHER THE GUY WHO RAN THIS

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
BUSINESS INTO THE GROUND

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
OR THE ONE WHO MADE IT RUN.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.999
Sammy: HE HELPED ME DEVELOP

09:01.999 --> 09:04.999
MOST OF THIS RESTAURANT ON PAPER

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
BEFORE WE EVEN CAME HERE.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
[ Voice breaking ] AND THAT'S

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
THE [BLEEP] TRUTH, MARCUS.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
AND HE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
'CAUSE OF THAT REASON.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
AND IT'S --

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
AND IT'S [BLEEP] RIDICULOUS.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
[ SNIFFLING ]

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
[ CRYING ]

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
Lemonis: UM...

09:26.999 --> 09:30.999
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE MORE HURT

09:26.999 --> 09:30.999
THAT YOUR BROTHER WAS KICKED

09:26.999 --> 09:30.999
OUT.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
Sammy: YEAH, HE -- HE RAISED ME.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
MY PARENTS

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
ARE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE,

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
YOU KNOW, FIRST-GENERATION,

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
WORKED TWO JOBS,

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
SOMETIMES EVEN THREE.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
-Lemonis: FIRST-GENERATION WHAT?

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
-Sammy: FROM MONTENEGRO.

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
HE DIDN'T HAVE

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
THE OPPORTUNITIES I HAD IN LIFE,

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
'CAUSE WHEN HE WAS 18,

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
HE WAS WATCHING ME.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
AND THIS WAS MY OPPORTUNITY

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
TO SET HIM UP.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
Lemonis: YOU REALLY BUILT THIS

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
FOR HIM, DIDN'T YOU?

09:49.999 --> 09:52.999
Sammy: I BUILT IT FOR -- FOR

09:49.999 --> 09:52.999
MY BROTHER AND FOR MY FAMILY.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.999
[ Voice breaking ] I FEEL

09:53.000 --> 09:55.999
I FAILED THEM. I REALLY DO.

09:55.999 --> 09:56.999
Lemonis:

09:55.999 --> 09:56.999
WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
-IT'S OPEN.

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
-Sammy: HE'S NOT HERE.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
HE'S NOT HERE.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
THE RESTAURANT IS FALLING APART.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
HE'S HOME

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS.

10:02.999 --> 10:05.999
IT'S TOUGH.

10:02.999 --> 10:05.999
IT'S REALLY TOUGH, MARCUS.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
Lemonis:

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
SO, HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB?

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999
Sammy:

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999
HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB, NO.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
Lemonis:

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
DOES HE LIVE FAR FROM HERE?

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
Sammy: HE LIVES

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
IN THE SAME HOUSE I LIVE IN.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
Lemonis:

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
HOW FAR IS THAT FROM HERE?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
THIS IS A RESTAURANT,

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
NOT AN AUTO-REPAIR CENTER.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.999
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
THAT YOU GUYS TOOK EVERYTHING

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
OUT OF THIS PLACE

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
THAT'S NOT CLEAN.

22:30.999 --> 22:33.999
DUDE, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

22:33.999 --> 22:37.999
I'M FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE WHAT

22:33.999 --> 22:37.999
I SIGNED UP FOR WASN'T THIS.

FOR OUR P.O.S. RECEIPTS.

22:44.999 --> 22:47.999

22:44.999 --> 22:47.999
I MEAN, THIS IS A [BLEEP] JOKE.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.999
YEARS OF FINANCIAL DATA

22:48.000 --> 22:50.999
AND CUSTOMER RECEIPTS

22:50.999 --> 22:55.999
ARE SITTING IN A CARDBOARD BOX

22:50.999 --> 22:55.999
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FLOOD ZONE.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
THIS IS NEGATIVE STEPS

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
YOU ARE WAY MORE F'ed UP

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999

WITH ALL THE TICKETS

23:06.999 --> 23:07.999
AT THE END OF THE DAY?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.999

23:08.000 --> 23:10.999

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
THIS PLACE IS FILTHY.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
IT'S ALMOST LIKE

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
STANDARD BURGER

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
FEELS MORE LIKE SUBSTANDARD.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
-I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT OFF.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
-Sammy: "WE SET THE STANDARD"?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
YOU DON'T SET ANY STANDARD.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
GET THE RAZOR.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
TAKE THAT [BLEEP] OFF.

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
I DON'T WANT THAT STANDARD.

23:24.999 --> 23:27.999
THERE ARE A MILLION BUSINESSES

23:24.999 --> 23:27.999

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
I DON'T NEED

WITH FOUR OR FIVE GUYS

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
WALKED AWAY FROM THE PLACE

23:35.999 --> 23:38.999
AND HAVE LEFT ME TO CLEAN IT UP.

23:38.999 --> 23:39.999
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN

23:38.999 --> 23:39.999
A MISTAKE FOR ME.

Sammy: MARCUS, I DON'T WANT YOU

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
TO FEEL THAT WAY.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
TALKING ABOUT CLOSING FOR?

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999

HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES.

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
LOOK, THREE DAYS AGO,

24:00.999 --> 24:03.999
I THOUGHT WE COULD FIX THE

24:00.999 --> 24:03.999
PROCESS AND IMPROVE THE FOOD.

24:03.999 --> 24:07.999
BUT HONESTLY, IT'S GONNA TAKE

24:03.999 --> 24:07.999
WAY MORE THAN THAT.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
IF WE REALLY WANT

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
TO SET THE STANDARD --

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
AND I TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
'CAUSE THESE GUYS HAVE THE HEART

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
AND THE PASSION --

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
THEN WE'RE GONNA

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
HAVE TO TEAR THIS PLACE

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STUDS

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999

MORE TABLES, MORE CHAIRS,

MORE MONEY.

24:35.999 --> 24:38.999
I WANT TO DO WITH THIS SPACE

24:38.999 --> 24:39.999
IS BRING ATTENTION

24:39.999 --> 24:42.999
TO THE TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS

A NEW ICE CREAM STATION

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
AND A NEW POTATO STATION

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
THAT HAVE AMAZING MARGINS.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
TAKE THAT CURRENT DESSERT AREA

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
AND TURN THAT

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
INTO THE POTATO STATION.

IF YOU EVER ORDERED

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999

24:56.999 --> 24:59.999
YOU SELL IT

24:56.999 --> 24:59.999
FOR SOMEWHERE AROUND $5.99.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.999
IT PROBABLY, WITH THE TOPPINGS,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.999
COSTS NO MORE THAN $1.25.

25:29.999 --> 25:32.999
A BURGER ISN'T A GREAT BURGER

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
UNLESS IT'S GOT GREAT CHEESE.

Todd:

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
WHO WAS IT THAT CALLED YOU?

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
NO, IT WASN'T TODD

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
THAT CALLED YOU.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
Fuji:

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
AND WE COULDN'T RUN A BUSINESS.

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
Todd: THAT WASN'T TODD

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
THAT CALLED YOU.

27:56.999 --> 27:57.999
Fuji:

27:56.999 --> 27:57.999
IT WAS JUST NONSENSE.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
Todd: YEAH, HE CAN TELL YOU

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
Tranchina: FUJI'S HAD

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
A BAD EXPERIENCE, THOUGH.

28:01.999 --> 28:02.999
Todd:

28:01.999 --> 28:02.999
FUJI WASN'T AN ANGEL HERE.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
Lemonis: LOOK, CAMERAS ARE

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN A BUSINESS

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
BECAUSE YOU WANT

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
TO MONITOR TRAFFIC PATTERNS,

28:06.999 --> 28:09.999
AND YOU WANT TO PREVENT THEFT,

28:06.999 --> 28:09.999
BUT THESE CAMERAS --

28:09.999 --> 28:12.999
THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUT

28:09.999 --> 28:12.999
IN PLACE FOR ONE REASON,

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
AND THAT WAS TO WATCH FUJI.

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
AND THAT'S CREATED A MAJOR RIFT.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.999
JOE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
Covello: THERE WAS

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FUJI DID,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.999
BUT TOWARDS THE END,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.999
THERE WAS -- THERE WAS --

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
GUYS, FUJI WAS COMING IN LATE,

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
AND THEN THE GIRLS WERE CALLING.

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
Fuji: FUJI COMING IN LATE?

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
Covello:

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
THE STAFF WOULD CALL US.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
THE STAFF WOULD CALL ME OR TODD

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
AND SAY, "WE'RE WAITING OUTSIDE.

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
WE CAN'T GET IN

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
BECAUSE FUJI'S NOT HERE."

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
Tranchina: THAT'S HAPPENED

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
A NUMBER OF TIMES. AND I THINK

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
THAT STARTED HAPPENING ONCE FUJI

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
WAS FIGHTING WITH TODD.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
Covello:

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
AND THEN ONCE HE WOULD WALK IN,

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
HE WOULD EDIT THE TIME CLOCK

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
SO THAT WE WOULDN'T KNOW

28:41.999 --> 28:42.999
THAT THE TIME WAS [BLEEP] WITH.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
Fuji: WHO TOLD YOU --

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
THAT -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
-Sammy: IT'S NOT TRUE.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
-Covello: I'M NOT KIDDING.

28:46.999 --> 28:47.999
Fuji:

28:46.999 --> 28:47.999
I WAS NOT HERE ONE DAY LATE.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
-Covello: OKAY.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
-Fuji: THAT WAS KRISTIN.

28:49.999 --> 28:50.999
Covello:

28:49.999 --> 28:50.999
AND DON'T SAY IT'S NOT TRUE.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
YOU WERE PART

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
OF THE CONVERSATION.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.000
-Sammy: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.000
-Fuji: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
Sammy: I WASN'T

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
PART OF THE CONVERSATION.

28:55.999 --> 28:56.999
Fuji:

28:55.999 --> 28:56.999
NOW WE'RE GOING INTO [BLEEP]

28:57.000 --> 28:58.999
Tranchina:

28:57.000 --> 28:58.999
LISTEN, LISTEN, GUYS...

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999
Fuji: I WAS NOT ONE DAY LATE.

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999
I LIVE THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

29:00.999 --> 29:01.999
Sammy:

29:00.999 --> 29:01.999
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TIMES,

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
"HEY, NOBODY'S AT THE BURGER

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
PLACE TO OPEN UP. CALL FUJI."

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
SO, WHAT THE [BLEEP]

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
Fuji: I WAS LATE EVERY DAY, AND

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
I'M SWITCHING THE TIME CLOCK?

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
Tranchina: ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
I'M NOT GONNA GO IN FOR THIS.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
THIS AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN HERE.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
HEY! HEY!

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
Fuji: THAT'S THE [BLEEP]

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
THAT I LEFT THIS PLACE.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.999
Tranchina: THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.999
FUJI, THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:16.999 --> 29:17.999
DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN ON TV.

29:16.999 --> 29:17.999
STOP YOURSELF.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
Sammy: AFTER SIX MONTHS OF

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
[BLEEP] DOING WHAT I HAD TO DO.

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
Fuji: I WAS HERE EVERY [BLEEP]

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
SINGLE DAY ON TIME.

29:22.999 --> 29:25.999
Lemonis: CHANGING THE MENU

29:22.999 --> 29:25.999
ISN'T THAT HARD,

29:25.999 --> 29:27.000
NOR IS RENOVATING THE PLACE,

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
BUT GETTING PEOPLE

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
TO CO-EXIST AND WORK TOGETHER --

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
THAT'S THE HARD PART.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
THERE ARE SOME DEEP-SEATED

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
ISSUES HERE,

29:33.999 --> 29:36.999
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

29:33.999 --> 29:36.999
WE NEED TO RIP THE BAND-AID OFF.

29:36.999 --> 29:37.999
Sammy:

29:36.999 --> 29:37.999
GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
I'M DONE

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
WITH THIS CONVERSATION, TOO.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.000
Covello: OKAY. OKAY.

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
Sammy:

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.000
Lemonis: YOU KNOW WHY

29:42.999 --> 29:44.000
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT?

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO ARGUE.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.999
BUT I KNOW THERE'S MORE ISSUES

29:45.999 --> 29:48.999
'CAUSE I SEE THE REACTION.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
SAMMY, LIKE THAT, BUD.

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
Sammy: THIS IS WHY

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
I WALKED AWAY FROM IT.

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
THIS IS WHY

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
I ABANDONED THIS PLACE.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
-Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
-Sammy: THIS IS THE REASON.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
I'M [BLEEP] SHAKING.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
I CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH IT.

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
Lemonis: SO, COME ON BACK

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
IN HERE FOR A SECOND.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
HERE'S THE REALITY.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
THE RESTAURANT'S CLOSED,

30:01.999 --> 30:04.999
SO NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF

30:01.999 --> 30:04.999
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD OR NOT.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
IF YOUR BUSINESS IS IN TROUBLE

30:08.999 --> 30:10.999
AND YOU NEED MY HELP,

30:08.999 --> 30:10.999
LOG ON TO...

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
Lemonis:

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
THE RESTAURANT'S CLOSED,

30:19.999 --> 30:22.999
BOTH LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY,

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
SO NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD OR NOT.

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
THE REALITY OF IT IS,

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
IS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
SOME DEEPER PROBLEMS

30:29.999 --> 30:32.999
THAN JUST THE KIND OF STUFF

30:29.999 --> 30:32.999
WE DEALT WITH THE OTHER DAY.

30:32.999 --> 30:36.999
ONCE THIS ARGUMENT IS FINISHED,

30:32.999 --> 30:36.999
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD.

30:36.999 --> 30:37.999
Todd: OKAY.

30:36.999 --> 30:37.999
Lemonis: OKAY?

30:37.999 --> 30:39.000
AND I'M A BELIEVER

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
THAT EVERYBODY

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
THAT'S STANDING IN THIS ROOM

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
IS COMMITTED TO THIS.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
AND SO I THINK

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,

30:44.999 --> 30:47.999
THERE'S GONNA BE SIX GUYS,

30:44.999 --> 30:47.999
WE'RE GONNA OWN A BURGER PLACE,

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
-AND WE'RE GONNA KICK ASS.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
-Todd: LET'S GO.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
Covello:

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
AND I THINK THE DYNAMIC WILL

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
WORK THE WAY YOU HAD SET IT UP.

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
Lemonis: I KNOW THEY HAVE

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
THE RIGHT INTENTIONS.

30:53.999 --> 30:56.999
THEY JUST NEED SOMEBODY TO --

30:53.999 --> 30:56.999
TO GET THEM IN LINE.

30:56.999 --> 30:58.999
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST

30:56.999 --> 30:58.999
WITH YOU.

31:02.999 --> 31:03.999
ALL THE CAMERAS ARE GONNA GO

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
OVER THE REGISTER.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
Todd:

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
YOU COULD PROBABLY UNSCREW IT.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
-Sammy: YEAH.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
-Todd: [ CHUCKLES ]

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
Lemonis: NO MORE DISCUSSION

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
ABOUT A [BLEEP] CAMERA.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
I NEVER WANT TO HEAR

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
ABOUT CAMERAS IN HERE AGAIN.

31:17.999 --> 31:18.999
Fuji: SMASH IT.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
Lemonis: THE CONVERSATION

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
THAT WE JUST HAD

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
JUST NEEDED TO HAPPEN.

31:22.999 --> 31:26.999
AND I FEEL LIKE NOW WE'RE READY

31:22.999 --> 31:26.999
TO REALLY TURN THE CORNER.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
WE DON'T NEED CAMERAS

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
THIS IS THE START

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
OF SOMETHING NEW.

31:30.999 --> 31:33.999
Tranchina: THE BEST PART

31:30.999 --> 31:33.999
ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS FOR ME

31:33.999 --> 31:34.999
WAS YOU FIXING THIS.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
Lemonis:

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
THIS IS JUST GETTING FIXED.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
Tranchina: RIGHT, BUT I DON'T

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
WANT TO DO THAT NO MORE.

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
Lemonis:

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT?

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
Tranchina: I'M NOT ARGUING

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
WITH MY FRIENDS NO MORE FOR TV.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
SO DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.000
Lemonis: FIRST OF ALL,

31:44.999 --> 31:46.000
DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

31:46.999 --> 31:48.999
Tranchina:

31:46.999 --> 31:48.999
DON'T EMBARRASS MY FRIENDS

31:46.999 --> 31:48.999
AND FAMILY LIKE THAT AGAIN.

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
Lemonis: FIRST OF ALL,

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
I'M NOT HERE FOR TELEVISION.

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
-I DON'T CARE ABOUT TELEVISION.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
-Tranchina: OKAY.

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
Lemonis: THIS GUY

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
ANNOYED ME FOR TWO YEARS

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
BECAUSE HE SAID HE WANTED

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
TO SAVE HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH YOU.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.999
YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
YOU LOST YOUR FRIENDSHIP

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
WITH EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

32:03.999 --> 32:04.999
Tranchina: MM-HMM.

32:04.999 --> 32:05.999
Lemonis:

32:04.999 --> 32:05.999
AND IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT

32:06.000 --> 32:08.999
FOR ME TO COME HERE

32:06.000 --> 32:08.999
AND FIX YOU GUYS FIRST,

32:08.999 --> 32:13.999
BECAUSE THE BUSINESS WILL FAIL

32:08.999 --> 32:13.999
IF YOU GUYS AREN'T RIGHT.

32:13.999 --> 32:14.999
Sammy: OUR RELATIONSHIP --

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
WHAT IT USED TO BE TO NOW

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
NIGHT AND DAY.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
WE USED TO COME HERE

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BE HERE.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
IT WAS LIKE WE WERE DRAWN HERE.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
THERE WAS A LOVE

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
AND COMMITMENT HERE.

32:22.999 --> 32:24.000
NOW IT'S,

32:22.999 --> 32:24.000
"OH, I HAVE TO GO THERE."

32:24.999 --> 32:25.999
IT'S A [BLEEP] CHORE.

32:25.999 --> 32:27.999
WE HAD A DREAM.

32:25.999 --> 32:27.999
WE HAD A [BLEEP] PASSION.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
I DON'T KNOW

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
WHERE THE [BLEEP] IT WENT

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
AND WHAT THE [BLEEP] HAPPENED

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
TO IT, BUT WE HAD AN IDEA.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
WE HAD SOMETHING

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
THAT NOBODY HAD,

32:33.999 --> 32:35.000
AND NOBODY

32:33.999 --> 32:35.000
COULD TAKE IT AWAY FROM US.

32:35.999 --> 32:36.999
AND IT [BLEEP] WENT TO [BLEEP]

32:36.999 --> 32:38.000
IT WENT TO [BLEEP]

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
AND THAT'S

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
WHAT I WANT TO [BLEEP] FIX.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
THAT'S WHY I BOTHERED HIM

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
FOR TWO YEARS --

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
'CAUSE I STILL [BLEEP]

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
BELIEVE IN IT, STILL.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.999
THEY HAD 50 SEATS THAT TURNED

39:08.999 --> 39:11.999
AN AVERAGE OF 3 TIMES PER DAY,

39:11.999 --> 39:13.999
AT $10 AN AVERAGE ORDER.

39:13.999 --> 39:16.999
THAT'S $1,500 A DAY IN REVENUE.

39:16.999 --> 39:20.000
NOW, WITH THE OUTSIDE PATIO

39:16.999 --> 39:20.000
AND THE NEW INSIDE SPACE,

39:20.999 --> 39:21.999
WE HAVE 100 SEATS.

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
IF THOSE SAME 100 SEATS

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
TURN THE SAME 3 TIMES PER DAY,

39:25.999 --> 39:27.999
WELL, THAT'S 300 CUSTOMERS.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.999
BUT OUR AVERAGE ORDER

39:27.999 --> 39:31.999
IS NOW $15 PER CUSTOMER.

39:31.999 --> 39:34.999
THAT'S $4,500 PER DAY,

39:34.999 --> 39:37.999
AN INCREASE OF $3,000 PER DAY.

39:37.999 --> 39:38.999
ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS,

39:38.999 --> 39:42.999
THAT'S A LITTLE OVER $1 MILLION

39:38.999 --> 39:42.999
A YEAR IN INCREASED REVENUE.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
Boy: I HAD THE STANDARD BURGER.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
Lemonis:

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
YOU HAD THE STANDARD BURGER?

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
WE'VE DRAMATICALLY

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
CHANGED THE MENU

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
TO NOT ONLY

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
FIVE SIGNATURE BURGERS,

39:50.999 --> 39:54.999
BUT WE BUILT AN ENTIRE BUSINESS

39:50.999 --> 39:54.999
MODEL OFF OF POTATOES.

39:54.999 --> 39:57.999
THROW AN ORDER OF YUCCA IN.

39:54.999 --> 39:57.999
I WANT TO TRY IT.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
AND WHETHER THAT'S DIFFERENT

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
TYPES OF FRIES,

39:59.999 --> 40:03.999
LIKE REGULAR FRIES,

39:59.999 --> 40:03.999
SWEET POTATO FRIES, OR YUCCA,

40:03.999 --> 40:04.999
WE ADDED ALL THOSE THINGS.

40:04.999 --> 40:07.999
Lemonis: CHECK IT OUT. COME ON,

40:04.999 --> 40:07.999
GUYS. IT CAME OUT BEAUTIFUL.

40:07.999 --> 40:08.999
PICK YOUR POTATO,

40:07.999 --> 40:08.999
PICK YOUR TOPPINGS,

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
-OVEN, GO.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
-Sammy: SIMPLE. YEAH.

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
Lemonis:

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT,

40:11.999 --> 40:16.999
WE BUILT A VERY HIGH-MARGIN,

40:11.999 --> 40:16.999
VERY POPULAR BAKED-POTATO BAR.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.000
IT GIVES PEOPLE THE CHANCE

40:16.999 --> 40:19.000
TO BUY A BAKED POTATO

40:19.999 --> 40:22.999
OR A SWEET POTATO STUFFED WITH

40:19.999 --> 40:22.999
ALL THEIR FAVORITE TOPPINGS.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
WE'VE ALSO ADDED

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
AN ICE CREAM BAR.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
NOT ONLY IS THERE

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM,

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOW

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
IS A CAKE SHAKE.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
IT IS SO GOOD.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
IT COSTS US ABOUT $1.78

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
TO BUILD THE SHAKE,

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
INCLUDING ALL THE PRODUCTS

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
THAT CAN GO IN THERE.

40:35.999 --> 40:38.999
WE SELL THAT SHAKE FOR $5.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
SO, WE KNOW THE MARGINS

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
ARE SPECTACULAR.

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
-Woman: AH!

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
-Lemonis: YOU GUYS

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH RED

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
VELVET ICE CREAM ON THE ISLAND.

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
Lemonis: HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THE

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
ISLAND ARE SERVING YUCCA FRIES?

40:49.999 --> 40:50.999
-Sammy: NONE.

40:49.999 --> 40:50.999
-Lemonis: IF WE JUST SELL

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
ICE CREAM AND FRIES,

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
Tranchina: THE BURGERS

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
ARE REALLY JUST COMPLEMENTING

40:54.999 --> 40:55.999
THE ICE CREAM AND FRIES.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
Lemonis:

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
AND THEN THE BAKED POTATOES

40:56.999 --> 40:59.000
-HAVE GREAT MARGINS, AS WELL.

40:56.999 --> 40:59.000
-Tranchina: ALSO HUGE.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
SET UP FROM AT&T?

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
Tranchina: YES, AT&T CAME IN.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
THEY SET UP THE FREE WI-FI,

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
WHICH WAS GREAT.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
THE CUSTOMERS

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
ARE GONNA LOVE THAT.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
Lemonis: OKAY. WELL,

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
IT ALLOWS THEM TO COMMUNICATE.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
AND THEY CAN TAKE PICTURES,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
PUT THEM ON INSTAGRAM.

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
Tranchina: YEAH, WE LOVE THAT.

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO IT.

41:16.999 --> 41:18.999
Lemonis: BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE

41:16.999 --> 41:18.999
TO GET TO THE POINT

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999
WHERE WE CAN

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999
TAKE ORDERS REMOTELY.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
LIKE, IF THIS LINE GETS LONG,

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
WE CAN START

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
TO TAKE ORDERS OVER THERE

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
OR TAKE THEM OUTSIDE.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
Tranchina: I'D LOVE THAT.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
HOW HIGH WE CAN MAKE IT.

41:32.999 --> 41:36.999

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
IT'S LIKE I'M IN

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PLACE.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
ARE THERE ANY CAMERAS HERE

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR?

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
Todd: HIDDEN.

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
[ LAUGHTER ]

41:45.999 --> 41:46.999

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM ALL AWAY!

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
Lemonis: I'M PROUD

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
OF WHAT THESE GUYS HAVE DONE.

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
AND IN THE END, THEY RECOGNIZE

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
THAT BEING TOGETHER

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
AS FRIENDS --

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
ALMOST LIKE FAMILY --

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
IS THE ONLY WAY TO BE.

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
AND NOW THEY HAVE A BUSINESS

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
THAT'S BEEN REBUILT,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
ARE BEING REBUILT.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
WHAT I WANTED TO DO

42:05.999 --> 42:08.999
WAS DO SOMETHING

42:05.999 --> 42:08.999
THAT REALLY REPRESENTED

42:08.999 --> 42:10.000
THE RELATIONSHIP

42:08.999 --> 42:10.000
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
AND THE HISTORY THAT YOU HAVE

42:11.999 --> 42:14.999

[ LAUGHTER ]

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

42:27.999 --> 42:30.999
I STARTED WITH INVESTING IN

42:27.999 --> 42:30.999
A SMALL PLACE IN STATEN ISLAND,

42:30.999 --> 42:33.999
AND WHAT I'VE ENDED UP INVESTING

42:30.999 --> 42:33.999
IN IS A NATIONAL CONCEPT

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
THAT I THINK IS PORTABLE.

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
YOU GUYS

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
ARE THE FACES OF THE BUSINESS,

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
