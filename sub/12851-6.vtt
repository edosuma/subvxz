♪♪

00:08.175 --> 00:11.010
Are we running away?
Is that what we're doing?

00:11.012 --> 00:12.778
-I don't wanna run away.
-Maya would.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.179
This should be your idea,
not mine.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.848
Why we do we have
all of my clothes?

00:15.850 --> 00:16.882
Get on the subway.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.350
Wouldja just tell me
where we're going?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.184
To find you.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.859
All my life, I always wanted
to be you, Maya.

00:26.861 --> 00:31.463
Remember how we stood here,
and I put lip gloss on
for the first time,

00:31.465 --> 00:34.733
because I wanted to be bad,
like my best friend?

00:34.735 --> 00:37.336
Riley, how do you see lip gloss
as a bad thing?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.471
Lip gloss? Kissing?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.041
And that's all you taught me.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.310
Okay. We need to find me
as soon as we can.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.212
Remember
this is how we met Lucas?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.515
Yeah. What were the odds
you could just turn around

00:49.517 --> 00:50.649
and there would
be a guy like...

00:53.187 --> 00:55.220
(both giggling)

01:00.995 --> 01:02.995
You gonna tell us
what you decided or what?

01:02.997 --> 01:05.030
Is no one concerned
about Riley and Maya?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.331
The girls are fine.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.433
What'dja decide?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.235
Okay, Mr. Matthews,
don't you think

01:10.237 --> 01:11.837
everyone needs to get
their priorities straight?

01:11.839 --> 01:14.373
Hey, you home?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.775
Yeah, they're comin'
to see ya.

01:16.777 --> 01:20.279
-The girls are fine.
-See? Our priorities
are straight.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.247
So now we can talk about
something really important,

01:22.249 --> 01:23.582
what did you decide?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.917
(sighs)

01:39.800 --> 01:42.034
-Hi!
-Shawn.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.303

02:43.797 --> 02:45.330
Runnin' away, comin' here.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.431
Somethin' I would do.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.301
It wasn't my idea.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.435
What, you did this?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.670
Yeah, how 'bout that?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.339
Tell him why we're here.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.541
I don't wanna tell him.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.608
You came all this way.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.277
Tell me.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.444
You made us tea?

02:59.446 --> 03:02.614
Oh! Yeah!
And I got these
Swedish butter cookies.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.286
What's become of you?

03:07.288 --> 03:10.289
I'm evolving.
It's, uh-- it's actually
been quite a journey.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.490
I like who I am.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.992
Look! Mountains!

03:13.994 --> 03:16.161
And trees!

03:16.163 --> 03:18.430
So many trees!

03:19.533 --> 03:21.934
Oh, and there's that squirrel
that I talk to!

03:24.471 --> 03:27.506
Uncle Shawn, my best friend
is broken, and you did it.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.508
-Me?
-I need it to be you,

03:29.510 --> 03:30.809
because if it isn't you,
then it's me,

03:30.811 --> 03:32.044
and I don't want it to be me,

03:32.046 --> 03:33.645
so it needs to be you!

03:33.647 --> 03:35.547
Why are you broken?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.049
Remember how I was tough
and edgy?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.217
Yeah.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.651
Remember how
I was just like you?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.955
Yeah! I was tough and edgy!

03:46.193 --> 03:48.727
Why do you have tea
and Swedish butter cookies?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.396
I don't know
what you people like!

03:51.398 --> 03:53.432
How are you my fault?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.499
There can't be two Rileys,

03:54.501 --> 03:56.235
just like there can't be
two Mayas.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.402
For the world to work,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.371
there needs to be
one Riley and one Maya.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.006
I know that language.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.342
That's Topanganese.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.876
She's right.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.011
Is she?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.846
What happens
when you meet a good influence

04:07.848 --> 04:09.681
and they start to change you
for the better?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.017
That's when
your art teacher
says you're incomplete.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.218
Yeah. Tell me about it.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.420
I know,
because I had a good influence.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.022
You're incomplete?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.625
Look, you know,
when your dad and I first met,

04:19.627 --> 04:21.126
all he wanted
was to be like me?

04:21.128 --> 04:22.628
You don't think I'm a geek?

04:22.630 --> 04:23.462
Of course not.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.464
You think I'm cool?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.431
Of course not.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.367
Then what am I?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.435
You're Cory.
I'm Shawn.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.037
Just like it's always been.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.205
What else do you need to know?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.276
It was ridiculous
that he wanted to be like me.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.645
I mean, the guy
had a great family.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.579
Yeah.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.214
He had parents
who were there.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.248
Yeah.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.550
And then,
Cory met Topanga.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.553
Do you know what it's like
to go to high school
with Romeo and Juliet?

04:48.555 --> 04:52.124
Awhh...
and so, I loved Angela,

04:52.126 --> 04:54.626
because... I thought
I was supposed to.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.996
Because Cory had Topanga,
and they'd influenced me.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.765
And it didn't work.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.066
I mean, how could it not work?

05:01.068 --> 05:03.402
They worked.
Then they had you,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.637
and I couldn't catch up.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.673
So I don't have any of that.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.374
I've got trees.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.811
And that squirrel I talk to.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.580
Hi, Stevie.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.118
Cory Matthews
messed up my life.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.788
Yuh-oh.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.523
And I'm not gonna
let that happen to you

05:24.525 --> 05:26.825
because of some
second-generation
Cory Matthews.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.593
Oh!

05:28.595 --> 05:30.195
You're gonna protect me
from her?

05:30.197 --> 05:31.596
Didn't I say
I'd always be there
for you?

05:31.598 --> 05:32.631
Like Pluto.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.366
Be quiet, Baby Cory!

05:35.502 --> 05:37.703
I didn't meet you
'til I was 32,

05:37.705 --> 05:42.341
but... you're the reason,
Maya, that I believe
I could be a father someday.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.012
And that's
not because of Cory Matthews,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.948
that's my own--
what would you call that?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.884
Voice! Ya maroons.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.687
That's your own
unique voice saying
you care about me.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.823
You should listen to it
more often.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.791
Agree with that.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.660
Maybe I should.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.364
So you came to see me
because you've disappeared
a little?

06:07.301 --> 06:09.368
Then you came
to the right place!

06:09.370 --> 06:10.969
Let's get you back!

06:10.971 --> 06:13.872
First! We will pinpoint
the exact moment

06:13.874 --> 06:15.707
you stopped being Maya.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.610
And then we'll see,
it had nothin' to do with me.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.719
Oh, yeah!

06:27.721 --> 06:30.555
All those clothes
I bought you.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.258
(chuckles)
Look at that.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.534
If y'all will excuse me,
I'm gonna go to the bay window.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.703
-The girls aren't even here.
-I'm meeting someone else.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.671
This is our house!

06:47.741 --> 06:50.175
I care about your daughter
very much.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.510
My daughter now!

06:51.512 --> 06:54.780
I care about your daughter
very much, too.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.783
You know, Maya loves
to make fun of me.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.352
But then in Texas,
she doesn't want
to see me get hurt.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.188
She gets those feelings
from someone, Miss Hart.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.625
And from what I've heard,
it isn't her father.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.794
You are a wonderful mother.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.962
What about me, Chuckie?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.831
I've had it.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.968
We are wonderful mothers.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.439
Sure y'are.
Where are your daughters?

07:20.441 --> 07:21.973
We don't know.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.044
-They're with Shawn.
-They ran away to Shawn's?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.647
I don't think
they ran away from anything.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.883
I think they went
to find something.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.659
That's a cool picture.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.561
One of my favorites.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.398
What were you wishin' for?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.900
Uh, I don't remember.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.735
Okay.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.007
Uncle Shawn...
your photos are very beautiful.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.811
Thank you.
All the ones on this wall
are extra special to me.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.346
Yeah?

08:01.348 --> 08:03.615
What about that one?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.053
Lost your voice?

08:09.823 --> 08:13.091
I don't think
he's lost his voice, Maya.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.759
I think he's screaming.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.763
That was our first date.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.933
I know
what you were wishing for, Maya.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.336
I've wished for the same thing
my entire life.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.772
I care about your mother.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.241
I hope that's okay.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.677
It's okay.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.880
Keep going!

08:34.882 --> 08:38.650
-I like you, too!
-Keep going!

08:38.652 --> 08:42.287
I'm-- I'm very...
extremely fond of you.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.995
Say it!

08:49.997 --> 08:53.865
I don't know
what comes after that!
I'm damaged!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.902
I'm very extremely
fond of you, too.

08:56.904 --> 08:57.869
Say it!

08:57.871 --> 08:58.937
You know.

09:01.808 --> 09:05.844
Uncle Shawn...
do you know of any
good vintage stores around here?

09:05.846 --> 09:09.247
No, but, all our stores
have had the same stuff
on the shelves for 50 years.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.416
That'll work.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.019
All right, let's hear it.

09:14.021 --> 09:19.658
I'd like to sell
all of my clothes, please!

09:19.660 --> 09:20.759
That oughta do it!

09:31.672 --> 09:34.239
This makes me feel worse.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.440
Why?

09:36.376 --> 09:38.843
Because I do remember her.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.613
But just because
I'm dressing like her,
doesn't mean I am her

09:41.615 --> 09:43.281
or would even remember
how to be her anymore.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.850
Maya, that's nuts.
You are her.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.620
No, Riley.
I get it.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.422
Sometimes I look in that mirror

09:50.424 --> 09:52.757
and I don't even know
what's lookin' back
at me anymore.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.728
Well... then we need
to figure out
the exact moment

09:56.730 --> 09:58.196
when you stopped being you.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.631
(knocking on door)

09:59.633 --> 10:00.932
The moment has arrived.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.470
Why do I have to be here?

10:06.907 --> 10:09.874
Do you what kind
of a shlep this is?

10:09.876 --> 10:12.944
Is this even a place?

10:12.946 --> 10:17.983
My GPS said "end of the world"
40 miles ago!

10:17.985 --> 10:20.051
Why y'here, Pops?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.287
Shawn called me. I come.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.757
That's right.
It's like ring power
times a billion.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.792
Amateurs.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.795
What do we got here, Shawnie?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.464
You wanna know what we got?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.933
-Well, I came all this way.
-And thank you for that.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.902
-And now there's this.
-(screams)

10:39.406 --> 10:41.239
Shawn! For-- (screams)

10:45.979 --> 10:47.012
Yes?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.914
You... destroyed me!

10:49.916 --> 10:51.016
How so?

10:51.018 --> 10:53.118
You turned me into you!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.953
That's crazy!

10:54.955 --> 10:57.822
No... no, no,
that's not crazy.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.823
This... is crazy!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.058
(Cory screams)

11:02.462 --> 11:03.895
Oh, butter cookies!

11:05.932 --> 11:07.999
I'm wearing
a cable knit sweater!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.634
I'm-- I'm wearing slacks!

11:09.636 --> 11:11.870
You turned me into you!

11:11.872 --> 11:12.904
Ya ain't me!

11:14.808 --> 11:16.841
I would never wear that.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.017
I'm Feeny!

11:26.019 --> 11:28.453
I'm Feeny!

11:28.455 --> 11:30.855
You're Feeny's father!

11:32.893 --> 11:35.960
Captain Feeny!

11:35.962 --> 11:38.396
You... destroyed me!
(Cory yells)

11:38.398 --> 11:40.999
Maya, I never meant
to destroy you,

11:41.001 --> 11:42.701
I always just wanted
to be your best friend.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.904
You are, you always will be,
even when we grow up
and do that.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.979
I guess I just loved you
and your family so much,

11:54.981 --> 11:57.549
that every day I became
a little bit more like you.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.251
I wanted everything you had.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.886
Is that why you liked Lucas?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.088
Because I like him?

12:03.090 --> 12:05.523
I don't know.
I guess we'll figure that out

12:05.525 --> 12:06.925
when I'm me again.

12:08.228 --> 12:12.931
I spent most of my life
chasing what Cory
and Topanga had.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.300
Ha, ha, never caught us.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.904
You know, knowing you, Cor,
it-- it changed me
for the better.

12:19.906 --> 12:24.075
But then... I don't know,
maybe I just let myself
change too much.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.010
How do you change back?

12:26.012 --> 12:31.049
By knowing that I don't want
what Cory and Topanga
have anymore.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.284
I want
what I'm supposed to have.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.919
How ya gonna get it?

12:34.921 --> 12:39.090
I'd like to sell
all my clothes, please!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.932
You seem calm.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.268
Why wouldn't I be calm?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.138
Oh, I don't know,
because your daughter
got on a train

12:53.140 --> 12:54.739
and went upstate
to see Shawn?

12:54.741 --> 12:56.241
So did yours.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.377
Yeah, but somehow
I think the story
has to do with you.

12:59.379 --> 13:03.114
-Why?
-Because you seem calm.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.651
I trust that Shawn will say
the right thing to her.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.888
You know, it's something
I never thought I'd see.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.156
What?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.991
The way his eyes light up.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.893
I've known Shawn
almost his entire life,

13:14.895 --> 13:18.096
and I have never
seen his eyes
light up like that.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.098
He's really fond of Maya.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.967
I'm not talking about Maya.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.803
Then what are
you talking about?

13:24.805 --> 13:27.138
You know
what I'm talking about.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.173
Your eyes light up, too.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.941
They're lighting up right now.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.745
Katy, you are
a very good actress,

13:33.747 --> 13:36.114
but you can't hide
this anymore.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.650
I love somebody?

13:38.652 --> 13:41.119
Do you?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.721
And somebody loves me.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.172
Well, we look
like us again.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.676
Yeah. But you're right, Maya.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.378
These are just clothes.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.215
-Cor?
-Yeah, bud?

14:10.217 --> 14:13.151
What made me, me?

14:13.153 --> 14:17.488
You know what the best thing
is about best friends?

14:17.490 --> 14:20.558
You can always depend on them
to know who you are.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.361
Reckless spontaneity.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.998
-What?
-You always
lived in the moment, Shawn.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.635
You never cared about
what happened
or what people thought.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.504
I mean, you blew up
a mailbox.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.808
You turned Feeny's house
into a bed and breakfast,

14:36.810 --> 14:41.079
and you ran away
to find yourself
like 76 times!

14:41.081 --> 14:44.916
This ain't new.
You wanna find yourself?

14:44.918 --> 14:46.818
Remember
your reckless spontaneity.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.720
That's the best part of you.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.990
And the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.060
Besides Mom.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.162
I know my own life.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.300
Thank you.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.370
You've always
been there for me.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.838
I always will be.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.540
Once for the girls?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.509
Give the people what they want.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.217
Both:
Hah! Do, do, do, do, do!
Do, do, do, do, do!

15:19.219 --> 15:21.552
Do, do, do, do, do!

15:21.554 --> 15:25.223
Yeah! All right!
I remember Shawn Hunter.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.558
Well, does that change
the way you feel about me?

15:27.560 --> 15:30.028
Yeah.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.963
It does, Maya.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.832
Why don't you find yourself
so we can talk about it?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.736
Riley, can we please
find myself,

15:38.738 --> 15:39.771
'cause I'd really like to hear

15:39.773 --> 15:41.105
what he has to say.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.242
Keys to the school, please.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.145
You can't have the keys
to the school.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.148
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, buddy.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.083
Hey!

15:52.085 --> 15:53.318
Start finding yourself, Maya.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.686
It'll come right back to ya.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.288
Where we going?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.489
Thunder.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.224
Lightning.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.027
I know how to get Maya back.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.700
You gonna give us a ride or not?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.820
We're gonna find me in here?

16:28.822 --> 16:29.988
Yes!

16:29.990 --> 16:31.289
This is where you are, Maya.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.824
A blank canvas.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.093
-Fill it. Paint.
-Paint what?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.361
Whatever you feel.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.930
Right now,
I'm feelin' a little angry.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.366
Good! Who are you angry at?

16:41.368 --> 16:42.667
You.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.636
Okay.
Well, Shawn did have to fight
with my father

16:45.638 --> 16:47.305
before he could figure out
who he was.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.608
But, I'm sure
we'll be more mature
than that, right?

16:52.112 --> 16:55.346
I was a little girl,
and I climbed through
an open window

16:55.348 --> 16:56.547
because I heard singing.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.350
I was attracted
to what I saw inside.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.386
It was someone safe.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.354
Hello.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.992
This little ray of sunshine
who didn't have a care
in the world.

17:07.994 --> 17:12.230
You had everything.
Family meals around a table.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.965
I wanted that.

17:13.967 --> 17:17.301
"How was your day, Maya?"
"It was great, Dad."
You had that.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.404
You went to bed with a smile
on your face every night,

17:19.406 --> 17:20.789
while I went to bed wondering

17:20.790 --> 17:22.173
if my father
was going to be
at the breakfast table

17:22.175 --> 17:23.574
in the morning.
I wanted that!

17:23.576 --> 17:25.676
I wanted what you had.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.211
Every day was a new adventure--

17:27.213 --> 17:30.481
homework rebellion,
sneaking out to a college party.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.651
You were the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.353
I did... my job!

17:35.355 --> 17:38.022
There you are!

17:38.024 --> 17:39.924
-Where's the purple?
-Not the purple!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.195
I did my job, too!

17:44.197 --> 17:46.831
No! You let me become
too much like you!

17:46.833 --> 17:48.232
(Riley screams)

17:49.169 --> 17:52.670
Why? Because I always want us
to be together?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.739
Why? Because I wanted you
to be my sister,

17:54.741 --> 17:55.873
not for you to be me!

17:55.875 --> 17:59.243
I get to be me all the time,
Maya. I need you!

17:59.245 --> 18:01.279
Come back, are you back?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.382
Oh!

18:15.962 --> 18:20.465
Sometimes I like to paint
when it's quiet.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.202
You know the quietest place
there is? My classroom
in the middle of the night.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.138
How could I be so wrong?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.475
Real inspiration has no hours.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.444
-A true artist knows that.
-I tried to stop her.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.781
I'm a good girl.
She's a bad, bad influence.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.419
What've we got here?

18:41.421 --> 18:44.388
Hey, now.
Look at this, is this you?

18:44.390 --> 18:45.456
That your work?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.391
Yeah, that's who I am.

18:47.393 --> 18:52.497
Well, I see rage, darkness,
betrayal. A distinct voice.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.566
Just might be a pleasure
working with you, Miss Hart.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.268
So I'm complete now?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.402
Well, you're gettin' there.
Y'know why?

18:58.404 --> 18:59.737
I'm listenin'.

18:59.739 --> 19:04.575
Because of... this.
See this? In all the chaos,

19:04.577 --> 19:07.478
you protected
that one little area.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.280
What do you see there?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.082
I see hope.

19:11.084 --> 19:17.455
I see a unique voice
who's learned to appreciate
the influence of hope.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.590
Try not to lose that.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.126
I won't.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.463
And um...
and who painted this?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.198
Sorry.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.169
Don't be.
It's the greatest purple cat
I've ever seen.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.504
You'll never beat it.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.039
Can you please
paint something else now?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.674
Oh, you.

19:38.378 --> 19:42.480
Well... I'm expecting big things
from you, Miss Hart.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.682
Thanks, Mr. Jackson.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.684
So am I.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.161
Where the girls?

19:57.163 --> 19:59.397
They're not here.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.399
And you're sittin' in here
by yourself?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.968
Yeah.
I've been here
for like five hours.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.538
Okay, this is a new level
of creepy.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.477
I'm Farkle!

20:15.381 --> 20:18.182
I wanted to talk to you.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.817
Riley and Maya...
you love them, right?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.620
Of course I do.
How did you know?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.724
Oh, him.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.093
Well, so, I've said too much.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.997
Since the first grade.
Both equally.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.398
Nothing could ever change that.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.533
Why?

20:35.535 --> 20:36.901
That way,
you get to keep them both.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.737
Not choosing
was the best choice
I ever made.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.772
I had to choose.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.343
Yeah, well, I'm a genius,
you're an idiot with a face.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.877
So, I made a choice.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.112
You did?

20:48.114 --> 20:51.449
Wow. Well,
you couldn't go wrong, Lucas.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.151
Yeah. They're both lovely,
wonderful girls.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.856
Who turn into this at night.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.228
What happened to you two?

21:04.230 --> 21:05.363
Road trip.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.530
Went looking for Maya.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.432
Oh. Did you find her?

21:08.434 --> 21:11.369
You make a decision about us,
Ranger Rick?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.770
I did.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.205
Yeah?

21:14.207 --> 21:16.557
Well, it doesn't matter.

21:16.558 --> 21:18.908
-Yeah, it does!
-Yeah, we've been waitin'
for like, two years.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.046
No. It doesn't matter
because... you picked Riley.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.482
What?
How do you know?

21:24.484 --> 21:29.287
Yay!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Maya. Yay!

21:30.490 --> 21:32.823
Because no matter
who you picked,
you picked Riley.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.593
You pick her, you got Riley,
you pick me, you got Riley.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.295
'Cause that's
who I've been lately.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.163
What do you wanna do?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.499
I need to decide
whatever way I like you,

21:41.501 --> 21:43.834
and not whatever way
the little Mary Sunshine
part of me

21:43.836 --> 21:45.469
skippin' around in there
likes you.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.971
Okay, I don't skip.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.072
You skip.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.808
It's the safest way to travel.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.143
Y'know what else I do?

21:52.145 --> 21:53.577
This.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.447
Maya, I want you to know
that you've been a big influence

21:56.449 --> 21:59.650
-on me, too.
-Thanks.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.688
And when you find yourself?
Please don't lose me completely.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.922
We'll see how it goes.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.625
Do you think I'm a geek?

22:07.627 --> 22:08.526
Of course not.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.694
Do you think I'm cool?

22:09.696 --> 22:10.828
Of course not.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.364
Then what am I?

22:13.366 --> 22:18.436
You're Riley.
And I'm Maya,
just like it's always been.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.716
Riley?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.851
Yeah, it's me.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.952
Maya?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.020
Almost.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.154
Lucas?

22:37.156 --> 22:38.889
Not yet.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.992
We've decided
we're gonna take
a breath first

22:41.994 --> 22:43.861
and find out who we all are.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.464
Isn't that
how adults would do it?

22:49.235 --> 22:51.969
I have been reminded...

22:51.971 --> 22:53.871
that you can't help
but be influenced

22:53.873 --> 22:55.473
by the people
or the events of your life.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.507
Where were you guys?

22:56.509 --> 22:57.942
We had to pick somethin' up.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.546
And these can cause you
to... lose a part of yourself

23:02.548 --> 23:06.417
sometimes, or...
forget who you are
for a while...

23:07.653 --> 23:09.053
or what you need...

23:09.055 --> 23:10.888
to be
what you've always
wanted to be.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.660
I've been unfair to you.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.330
You don't know me.

23:19.332 --> 23:22.566
Y-You don't even know
that I'm a creature of...

23:23.870 --> 23:25.035
What was it?

23:25.037 --> 23:28.506
Reckless spontaneity.

23:28.508 --> 23:31.509
Shawn, what are you saying?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.779
I love your daughter...

23:36.549 --> 23:39.850
and I'm in love with you.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.789
I want us to take care
of each other forever.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.700
Do you wanna get married?

24:21.661 --> 24:22.726
Yes.
