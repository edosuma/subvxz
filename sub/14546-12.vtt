Since I had started dating
Ryan Shay

00:03.336 --> 00:04.421
I had learned
a couple of things.

00:04.462 --> 00:06.548
One, he required 30 grams

00:06.589 --> 00:08.216
of animal protein
at every meal.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.677
And two,
his after-school schedule

00:10.719 --> 00:12.262
was as tight as his abs.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.930
No, I can't do Wednesday.
Wednesday I've got wrestling.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.390
Okay.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.475
- Thursday?
- Circuit training.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.603
Then I have modeling,
jump rope club...nude modeling.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.773
Fine, what does
your Friday look like?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.567
Mmm.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.944
Mmm! Boy band practice.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.779
Wow.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.656
Seems like you got
a pretty full plate.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.159
Yeah, I need 30 grams
of animal protein

00:34.200 --> 00:35.368
at every single meal.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.121
No, I meant to say that..

00:38.163 --> 00:40.832
...your days are totally
and completely booked.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.292
They're overbooked.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.418
Well, I'm sure yours are too.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.669
You probably
have tons of awesome

00:44.711 --> 00:47.505
after school activities.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.091
No, yeah, totally.
I do. Tons.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.801
I had nothing going on

00:51.843 --> 00:53.636
and was in danger
of being pathetic.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.805
I needed an after-school
activity of my own.

You're like the Joy Behar
of cabana design.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.716
So? What do you think?
You like it?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.134
- Like it?
- Yeah.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.844
- I love it.
- Yeah?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.514
Think of all the cabana
parties I can now throw.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.016
And think of all
the cabana boys I can employ.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
You know I love
to employ people, George.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.270
Would you consider
employing a balcony?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.523
Well, who in their right mind
wouldn't want a balcony?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.441
That's like asking
if you want fries with that.

That's the chair.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.168
That is a phone.

Our host, Evan Spaghetti,
says he's not coming in, okay?

02:17.053 --> 02:19.514
The show goes live in five,
and we don't have a host.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.849
What's wrong with Evan?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.725
His pediatrician
says exhaustion.

Okay, th..
This is real!

Everyone, places! Go time!

What do we do now?

02:31.192 --> 02:32.569
Well, don't look at me.

You're the new producer

Where would you
like me to look?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.532
- I--
- Study hall!

02:37.574 --> 02:38.741
I forgot about study hall.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.118
It's a completely useless class.

It's like they want us
to cut it and make out.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.746
- So do you wanna?
- Ryan.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.582
Right now I'm in the middle
of managing a crisis.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.041
Tessa! You're a genius.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.210
He's absolutely perfect.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.045
I'm sorry.
I'm seeing someone already.

Uh, no, he means
you're perfect to host

02:53.798 --> 02:57.051
"Teen Talk" today.
Our host called in sick.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.386
You want me to bail you out?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.429
Well, when you
put it like that--

02:59.470 --> 03:01.014
- Yes!
- Okay.

She's living in my car.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.971
My car.
This has to be fixed.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.014
Y-you sure
this guy can help, because..

09:17.056 --> 09:20.268
Look, this guy is the ultimate
power broker in Chatswin.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.644
He controls the zoning board.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.853
He pulls permits
out of his back pocket

09:22.895 --> 09:24.480
like they're chewing gum.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.399
He's the Godfather.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.820
Marty? Steam room Marty?
He's your guy?

09:30.861 --> 09:32.446
'He's the Godfather?'

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
Gentlemen.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.036
What can I do for you?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.414
Well, Marty,
I'm, I'm here about Dallas.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.416
- You know Dallas?
- Know her?

09:43.457 --> 09:47.295
Why, I consider her
a close, personal friend.

09:47.336 --> 09:51.424
- Exactly.
- In fact, she's my best friend.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.843
Now I don't know
if you know this

09:53.884 --> 09:55.970
but we fought
in the war together.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.347
Okay-okay. You and Dallas Royce?

09:58.389 --> 10:00.057
Who the hell is that?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
Okay, Marty,
she's my girlfriend.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.729
And...it turns out
that half of her property

10:04.770 --> 10:06.814
is in East Chatswin,
and now she's being

10:06.856 --> 10:08.482
kicked out of the club,
her daughter is being

10:08.524 --> 10:10.568
thrown out of school.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.069
So you want me to go

10:12.111 --> 10:14.488
to her house and break bread.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.823
What? No.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.617
I'm asking you
to rezone her property

10:17.658 --> 10:20.036
so she can
remain a resident of Chatswin.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.954
And why would I do that?

10:21.996 --> 10:25.249
Uh, Marty, I gave you
an emergency root canal

10:25.291 --> 10:27.501
and did your crown for free.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.296
So you owe, you, you owe me.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.011
Everything you need..

10:37.053 --> 10:38.846
...is on this disk.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.725
Print it out,
fill out the paperwork

10:42.767 --> 10:44.894
and then come see me

10:44.935 --> 10:46.520
in the steam room.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.064
Where, where am I
gonna find a computer

10:48.105 --> 10:49.607
to open this thing up?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.360
Who do I look like? Al Gore?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.737
Before we go, I wanna take

10:54.779 --> 10:56.822
one final call about my body.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.575
[phone ringing]

10:59.617 --> 11:02.328
- You're on the air, caller.
- 'Hey. It's pretty warm out.'

11:02.370 --> 11:04.163
(man on phone)
'Can you tell us
how your body does in the heat?'

11:04.205 --> 11:06.290
(Ryan)
'Yeah, that's a,
that's a very good question.'

11:06.332 --> 11:08.125
'I actually get that one a lot.'

11:08.167 --> 11:11.504
'And hydration
is the key to hydration.'

11:11.545 --> 11:14.548
Now when I wanna get hydrated,
I like to drink

11:14.590 --> 11:16.592
stuff through my mouth.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.765
Till next time.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.351
Okay. You know what?
This is stupid.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.396
This is...just...stupid!

11:28.437 --> 11:31.023
'I want my name off the show.'

11:31.065 --> 11:33.359
Tessa, please.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.277
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- I'm embarrassing myself?

11:35.319 --> 11:37.363
You're the one spending
a whole entire study hall period

11:37.405 --> 11:39.240
talking about your body.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.741
Hey, the only reason
I even agreed

11:40.783 --> 11:42.535
to do "Body Talk"
was for you.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.286
I know this is your only
extra curricular activity.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.372
I know it must make you feel
like a big loser.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.998
A big loser?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.793
No, no. Uh, look,
it's okay, though.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.712
You're less popular than me,
you have less friends than I do

11:52.753 --> 11:54.338
and you have little
to no activities.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.258
But...I'm still super,
super into you, like, I'm..

11:57.299 --> 12:00.678
I do not need your pity! Okay?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.304
I don't need your help.

12:02.346 --> 12:06.642
I could make this show
a huge success without you.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.269
Okay.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.521
We both know that's not true.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.441
Okay, you have no idea
what people find interesting

12:13.482 --> 12:15.484
and you told me
to open with an antidote

12:15.526 --> 12:16.902
whatever the hell that is.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.029
I would literally
rather watch anything

12:19.071 --> 12:20.573
anything else

12:20.614 --> 12:23.951
'than you
talking about your body.'

12:23.993 --> 12:25.077
What are you trying to say?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.662
What I'm trying to say is

12:26.704 --> 12:28.956
you are fired.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.125
Well, if you're trying
to say that, congratulations

12:31.167 --> 12:32.626
it to me!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.962
- Yes, I said it.
- Wow!

12:35.004 --> 12:36.464
[instrumental music]

12:36.505 --> 12:37.882

'Mommy, I'm home.'

12:50.811 --> 12:52.229
Back here!

12:55.941 --> 12:59.111
How was school today?
Did you make any new friends?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.738
No.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.491
Everyone at my new school's
tanner than me.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.327
They act like I'm not
tan enough to be going there.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.078
That's ridiculous.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.665
No one should ever be judged
by how deep their tan is.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.417
I know, right?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.961
I just wish they could look
beyond the color of my tan

13:16.003 --> 13:18.380
and see the content
of my closet.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.300
Because I have really nice stuff
in my closet, you know?

13:21.342 --> 13:22.593
I know.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.970
And that's a beautiful dream.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.599
You know,
I can't remember the last time

13:28.641 --> 13:32.394
we had an after-school espresso,
just the two of us.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.980
Maybe being ostracized
by our community

13:35.022 --> 13:37.942
and driven out of our home
was a blessing in disguise.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.528
Yeah.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.696
It's a good disguise, mommy.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.243
Where's my kangaroo?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.581
[instrumental music]

13:52.623 --> 13:54.250
Ha ha. Marty.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.419
It was not easy, but I found
an old library in Queens

13:57.461 --> 14:00.881
that has a working Quadra 650.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.925
'I have here the documents,
all filled out'

14:02.967 --> 14:05.052
'ready for your approval, sir.'

14:09.265 --> 14:10.432
- Thank..
- Hey.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.560
"Rejected?" Marty, you bastard.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.187
What, I, I-I filled out the
paperwork just like you said.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.481
The paperwork
doesn't change the fact

14:17.523 --> 14:20.776
that 58% of the property
is in East Chatswin.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.529
Thus making it 100%

14:23.571 --> 14:26.073
in East Chatswin.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.409
Why did you make him
fill out the paperwork

14:28.450 --> 14:30.452
if you were
just gonna reject it?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.788
- Protocol.
- 'Alright, you know what?'

Don't come crying to me
the next time your crown cracks!

14:35.124 --> 14:37.585
My crown is already cracked!

14:37.626 --> 14:39.962
I had to get a partial bridge!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.882
Ew.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.760
Okay. That...is a bridge
too far, my friend.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.721
That is a bridge too far!

Today we are going to be talking
about what it takes

15:08.324 --> 15:10.534
to get an episode
of television on the air

15:10.576 --> 15:12.953
how to deal with talent,
manage the expectations

15:12.995 --> 15:14.747
of the faculty,
and how to produce

Sorry, albinos can't drink
from this fountain.

You're so pale.
You look like a vampire.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.987
Do you need a transfusion?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.697
You should be in the next

looks like a dead vam--

15:50.991 --> 15:54.328

not good enough for you guys.

It's not your tan. It's you.

Oh. I used to make fun
of new people too.

Just ask Tessa.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.423
Maybe one day
you'll get transferred

16:06.465 --> 16:07.633

What is this?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.445
Our ratings went down 24.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.322
That means we got a 1.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.165
But I can't
dedicate myself to a show

on the most superficial

- Kind of.
- 'Then you should know.'

isn't Ryan's great body.

He also has an amazing spirit.

unfruited being a nine?

neither one of us

19:04.893 --> 19:06.603
(woman on phone)
'Hey, Tessa,
I was just wondering'

19:06.645 --> 19:09.022
'what's your favorite part
of "The Body's" body?'

19:09.064 --> 19:10.899
Great question, caller.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.068
Um..

19:13.110 --> 19:15.988
I'd have to say it's his heart.

19:16.029 --> 19:19.992
Yeah, his heart is even bigger
than his quads

19:20.033 --> 19:23.537
which, as you know, are...huge.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.621
[Ryan clears throat]

19:25.497 --> 19:27.124
[instrumental music]

19:27.166 --> 19:30.210
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an exciting day

19:30.252 --> 19:32.045
'on "Body Talk."'

19:32.087 --> 19:35.299
Please welcome
the star of our show

19:35.340 --> 19:39.553
and the guy
I wanna say sorry to.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.096
Ryan Shay.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.016
[instrumental music]

19:47.060 --> 19:49.188
I'm sorry I called you a loser.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.816
I'm sorry
I was acting like one.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.238
[music continues]

20:09.416 --> 20:10.959
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.628
And Noah wasn't willing
to lose his best friend

20:12.669 --> 20:14.630
to East Chatswin.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.591
[singing in foreign language]

20:22.888 --> 20:24.932
Noah, what's going on in here?

20:24.973 --> 20:27.351
Hey, Marty!

20:27.392 --> 20:29.186
What, you don't like
my friends?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.854
'I got them all guest passes.'

20:30.896 --> 20:32.606
They love it here.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.816
They said they're gonna come
all the time, huh?

20:34.858 --> 20:36.735
Yeah!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.987
You bastard.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.698
How much
to get my steam room back?

20:41.740 --> 20:45.452
You can get it back cheap.
It'll just cost you one stamp.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.665
And just like that
the Royces were citizens

20:49.706 --> 20:51.166
of Chatswin again.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.543
And not a minute too soon
for Dalia.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.546
[indistinct chattering]

20:59.007 --> 21:01.760
(Dalia)
'Bye, losers.
I'm done being a loser.'

21:03.220 --> 21:05.555
Does this school validate?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.641
My old school validates.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.728
No? You guys all
probably take the bus.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.731
