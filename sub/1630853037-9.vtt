11:09.835 --> 11:11.420
I can't.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.798
That door was the portal
and you sealed it shut.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.466
Which would be
bad enough,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.843
but this Mumford trap
isn't made for me,

11:17.885 --> 11:19.053
so it's unstable.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.389
If I let you go, will you behave

11:21.430 --> 11:24.016
like a rational being
for, like, ten seconds?

11:26.894 --> 11:29.397
Okay.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.774
Maybe we could reach out
to Kaela and Dev...

11:31.816 --> 11:33.150
(panting)

11:34.860 --> 11:36.112
...get them to hear us.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.326
(hisses)

11:42.368 --> 11:44.328
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.622
(screeches)

11:49.750 --> 11:52.878
Hey. What are you doing?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.422
Margarita.

11:54.463 --> 11:58.050
It's a flower.
You're our flower.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.220
We grew you,
Maggie.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.305
The bowl is under
the flower bed.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.725
I'll get the toolbox.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.061
HARRY:
Maggie's vision, the Lost One,

12:09.103 --> 12:11.272
this damn Unity Bowl,
it's all linked.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.190
It has to be.
We just can't see it.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.734
And we're running out of time.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.944
The groundswell of support
for the Unseen is growing.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.946
We need someone who can help us,
someone with special knowledge.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.656
Like...?

12:20.698 --> 12:22.408
The Graiai.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.452
Three ancient
and profound seers,

12:24.493 --> 12:26.746
blessed and cursed
with knowing all truth.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.539
(laughter)

12:31.584 --> 12:33.419
Ooh, Pammy.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.130
And don't come back
without a bottle.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.341
Or... a dish.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.843
(laughter)

12:40.885 --> 12:44.180
Oh, whoops, clean up
on aisle: this bitch.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.640
(both laugh)
JORDAN:
Oof.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.975
I pity the poor idiot
who has to deal

12:48.017 --> 12:50.186
with that hot mess express, hmm?

12:50.227 --> 12:51.562
Yeah, well.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.899
We're the idiots.
Those are the Graiai.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.692
(screaming, laughter)

12:56.734 --> 12:58.110
♪ ♪

13:03.032 --> 13:05.034
Wait, wait, wait. Truce?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.577
What, so you can
attack me again?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.537
No, so we don't freeze to death.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.623
(wind whistling)

13:10.664 --> 13:13.083
How do I know I can trust you?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.086
(panting)

13:16.128 --> 13:18.297
I swear on the graves
of my people.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.553
Fine.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.264
Let's use that table over there
to block the wind.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.686
(soft pattering)

13:37.191 --> 13:39.068
Hello?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.195
(high-pitched laughing)

13:43.364 --> 13:45.825
(rapid footfalls)

14:04.593 --> 14:06.262
(exhales)

14:09.056 --> 14:11.225
I see you.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.854
Time to make a happy home.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.689
No, no, no.
(shouts)

14:18.315 --> 14:19.483
Now what?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.193
Once the potion is finished,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.529
we pour it on the trap
and break the spell.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.864
How much longer?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.031
Almost there.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.616
(clears throat)

14:28.993 --> 14:30.661
So, um...

14:32.580 --> 14:34.081
...your birth parents.

14:34.123 --> 14:38.836
How... how was that?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.171
Enlightening?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.924
Upsetting?

14:43.966 --> 14:47.469
Fulfilling?
Over... Overwhelming?

14:47.511 --> 14:48.929
Nearing the end
of my mental thesaurus here.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.016
Yeah, um, hey, we don't...

14:52.057 --> 14:54.059
you don't...
What?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.187
...have to get this deep.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.773
You're, like, not that guy, no?

14:59.815 --> 15:01.567
Wow. Okay.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.985
(stammers)
Look, no, no.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.737
Hey. No offense.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.573
It's just that...
When I had leukemia,

15:07.615 --> 15:11.076
I had to learn real quick that
not everyone in your life

15:11.118 --> 15:14.371
is gonna be able to handle
the really hard parts.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.334
I mean, Brynn? Ride-or-die.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.463
You, you're like...
fun-time guy.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.798
And that-that's okay.
I don't expect you

15:24.840 --> 15:27.593
to nurse me during chemo
or drive me to the airport

15:27.635 --> 15:31.639
or... talk about my bio parents.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.475
(quietly):
Yeah.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.018
Hey, we have a really
nice time together,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.355
and... I really like
being around you, okay?

15:39.396 --> 15:42.149
Okay, yeah,
we'll just focus on Mel.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.485
Right? Yeah. Um...
Mm.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.153
Once we create the portal,

15:46.195 --> 15:47.863
she'll have 30 seconds
to get out of there.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.366
30 seconds? That's...
that's not long at all.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.659
Which is why we have
to come up with a way

15:51.700 --> 15:53.535
to make sure she's aware
of the plan.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.789
I think I have an idea.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.208
(Trunksie giggling)

15:59.249 --> 16:01.168
(choking)

16:11.887 --> 16:13.847
(laughter)

16:13.889 --> 16:15.975
HARRY:
Ladies, I come
bearing bubbly.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.769
We never say no to offerings...

16:19.895 --> 16:20.813
...or hotties.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.649
Have a seat, Harry Greenwood.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.276
And your little friend, too. Hi.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.611
(laughs softly)

16:30.823 --> 16:32.116
I asked you here today

16:32.157 --> 16:33.909
to help me...
DANI:
With the lore

16:33.951 --> 16:35.661
of the Lost One.
The new prophecy

16:35.703 --> 16:36.870
of an old evil returning

16:36.912 --> 16:39.206
and the Charmed Ones'
part to play.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.500
Not to mention, the damn bowl.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.085
(laughter)

16:44.545 --> 16:45.879
Well, yes.

16:45.921 --> 16:46.964
Totes. But...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.383
Nothing comes without a cost.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.135
Truth for truth.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.012
BOTH:
Truth for truth.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.014
What's that mean?

16:55.055 --> 16:56.765
Means you bare your soul,
and you'll find out

16:56.807 --> 16:58.434
about your precious bowl.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.893
(both scoff)

16:59.935 --> 17:01.437
Did you see how I just
made that rhyme?

17:01.478 --> 17:03.188
(chuckles)
Didn't even mean to.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.066
Right? Can't believe
we're related.
You are so lame.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.027
Well, I suppose I'm still
struggling with...

17:08.068 --> 17:09.236
DANI:
Oh, no.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.530
Not you, peach.
(laughter)

17:11.572 --> 17:13.282
No, no.
No offense, but...

17:13.323 --> 17:15.242
you're not exactly fresh meat.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.037
We want the lowdown
on the White-hot-lighter

17:18.078 --> 17:19.955
and his relationship
with Margarita Vera.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.499
Tell us all, and tell us true...

17:22.541 --> 17:26.628
...or something dreadful
will come to you.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.633
(strains)

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
Oh, my God.
(Trunksie giggles)

17:37.014 --> 17:39.099
(grunts)
We got to get this off you.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.684
(Trunksie laughs)

17:40.726 --> 17:43.187
(Ray coughing)

17:43.228 --> 17:45.939
What the...

17:48.776 --> 17:50.569
(rapid footfalls)

17:50.611 --> 17:52.571
(Trunksie laughing)

17:52.613 --> 17:54.698
(screeches)

17:54.740 --> 17:56.450
Trunksie?
How the hell

17:56.492 --> 17:58.327
did that thing come to life?

17:58.368 --> 18:00.162
And why does it
want to kill me?

18:01.121 --> 18:02.206
I don't know.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.373
(coughing)

18:03.415 --> 18:05.626
It's dead now.
It's okay.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.003
Here.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.756
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.258
You want some good news?
Uh-huh.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.344
Your archenemy Dexter
has a lead on the bowl.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.430
(grunts)
Why, that sneaky little bastard.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.974
Seriously? He's trying to help.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.602
No, not Dexter.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.729
Trunksie.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.606
He's gone.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.158
DEXTER:
Maggie, look what I found.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.452
TRUNKSIE:
(giggles) Time to make
a happy home.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.787
What the...?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.669
(sighs)

18:48.710 --> 18:51.088
"Let's make your house
a happy home."

18:51.130 --> 18:52.464
Yeah, that's what
that little psycho

18:52.506 --> 18:54.550
was babbling
when he was attacking me.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.634
Me, too.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.012
Maybe it was his twisted way
of accomplishing that.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.890
You guys were fighting with each
other, so he tried to kill you,

19:01.932 --> 19:03.976
and then you were
fighting over the bowl...
RAY: So he stole it.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.352
That's kind of clever
for something

19:05.394 --> 19:07.521
that's got fluff for brains.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.440
Great, we've FBI-profiled him.
How does this game help?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.192
Well, we can't just chase
the furry freak,

19:12.234 --> 19:13.569
he might destroy the bowl.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.237
So we have to...

19:17.823 --> 19:19.616
(quietly): We have
to lure him out, using this.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.160
When he shows up,

19:21.201 --> 19:22.953
I'll incept him to sleep,
you grab the bowl.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.038
Game over.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.584
Okay, I have to ask.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.045
Exactly why do you
hate me so much?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.508
(exhales)

19:38.427 --> 19:41.180
I used to have a life,

19:41.221 --> 19:43.515
a really good life.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.227
Then, one night, on
the way home from work,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.606
this car started following me.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.525
I tried to lose them,
but they just sped up

19:53.567 --> 19:57.196
faster and faster, and then...

19:59.114 --> 20:01.575
...then they ran me
off the road,

20:01.617 --> 20:03.911
straight into a ditch.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.415
Used up one of these.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.418
Hands off.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.129
Okay.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.672
Sensitive about the arm.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.675
I get it.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.677
Why would someone
want to do that to you?

20:20.719 --> 20:22.262
It was the Faction.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.057
And they left
me for dead.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.600
I managed to escape,

20:26.642 --> 20:30.103
but for a long time,
I couldn't sleep.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.940
Couldn't eat.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.068
I lost everything.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.029
It has been more
than two years,

20:39.071 --> 20:43.283
and every time I close my eyes,
I am right back there.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.703
Sunny, I am so sorry.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.373
We did everything
we could to stop them.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.291
Not soon enough.

20:52.542 --> 20:56.129
For months, magical
creatures were being hunted,

20:56.171 --> 20:58.215
picked off the streets.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.217
I was one of the lucky ones.

21:00.259 --> 21:05.514
We are just three women who got
all of this foisted on us.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.182
But that doesn't change the fact
that we didn't feel included

21:07.224 --> 21:09.059
or protected.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.687
But the Lost One

21:11.728 --> 21:14.106
is gonna put us first.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.400
If you're first,

21:16.441 --> 21:20.237
then someone has to be
second, then third.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.531
And then it's just
another hierarchy.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.369
No, that's not...

21:27.411 --> 21:28.996
It won't be like that.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.124
Sunny, it's not right
that you feel excluded.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.584
We can work together.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.628
To change that.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.341
ENYA:
Let's start with the easy stuff.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.927
Sex.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.847
Yes, how is it when you make

21:46.888 --> 21:48.265
the beast
with two backs?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.892
Mm-mm. Nah.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.228
We're not going there.
ENYA:
Kidding.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.604
We're kidding.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.440
Just spill some tea.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.733
Where do you two stand?

21:57.774 --> 21:59.067
Friends?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.402
Or more?

22:00.444 --> 22:02.321
I want us to be together.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.489
I think of her
all the time.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.743
I care a lot about her.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.453
(sighs) Romantic.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.455
Yeah, so sweet.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.458
But when you look at the future,
what do you see?

22:14.499 --> 22:18.503
I think maybe we have a shot.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.591
Ladies?

22:22.632 --> 22:26.511
I think we have what we need.

22:26.553 --> 22:29.848
And we're ready to tell you
the secret of the bowl,

22:29.890 --> 22:32.309
which is...

22:32.351 --> 22:34.478
Ugh. It's actually, like,
super-duper easy

22:34.519 --> 22:35.812
to remove the curse of the bowl.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.939
(laughter)

22:37.981 --> 22:41.151
A potion and a spell,
and all will be well.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.528
(chuckles)

22:48.116 --> 22:50.035
Ask a scary question.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.247
Do you think Macy's
still watching over us?

22:54.289 --> 22:55.749
(chuckles softly)

22:57.250 --> 23:00.837
When she was little
and it would rain,

23:00.879 --> 23:04.257
she would go out and rescue
all the worms from the sidewalk.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.303
She saved up her lunch money
for six months straight

23:08.345 --> 23:11.139
so her friend could go
to science camp.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.600
And when...

23:13.642 --> 23:17.396
I got sick
and she thought I had cancer,

23:17.437 --> 23:19.439
she donated her stem cells

23:19.481 --> 23:22.317
to an experimental
cancer treatment--

23:22.359 --> 23:24.653
the Progenitor Project...

23:25.862 --> 23:28.615
...to try and save me.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.284
She was my angel then,

23:31.326 --> 23:34.663
and I have no doubt
she still is now.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.793
Bad dad make Maggie sad.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.294
No, Trunksie.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.380
These are happy tears.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.006
Come see for yourself.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.219
Naptime, buddy.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.432
(grunting)

23:54.724 --> 23:58.228
(straining):
No. No!

23:58.270 --> 23:59.896
(groans)

23:59.938 --> 24:01.523
Maggie's a liar.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.234
No happy home for liars.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.445
What the hell?

24:06.486 --> 24:08.155
I-I incepted him with sleep.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.990
What is this, opposite day?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.868
Actually, it might be.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.620
You said
when a spirit leaves the Veil

24:15.662 --> 24:17.164
and comes to
the land of the living,

24:17.205 --> 24:18.957
it throws the balance
of things off, right?

24:20.041 --> 24:22.294
Well, so far off,
my powers are reversed.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.963
So instead of
knocking Trunksie out...

24:25.005 --> 24:26.548
It turned him into
a raging psycho.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.924
Yeah, but how
did it come to life?

24:29.259 --> 24:31.678
That potion you spilled on him.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.389
It should kill
anything it touches.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.267
Instead, it brought it to life.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.352
So, now what?

24:40.395 --> 24:44.441
TRUNKSIE:
Trunksie make you all
go night night, forever.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.366
No sign of him or the bowl.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.118
DEXTER:
That's it.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.786
We're bailing out.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.622
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I agree with you.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.082
No. We can't give up.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.792
We need that bowl to save Ray.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.169
No. No, no, no, no, no.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.837
We will find
another way to heal me.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.589
We are not gonna be the
idiots in the horror film

25:07.631 --> 25:09.049
who stay in the house.
Amen, brother.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.550
You're not going anywhere.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.302
You're gonna listen to me,

25:12.344 --> 25:14.387
because I know magic,
and I'm smart

25:14.429 --> 25:16.181
and resourceful and capable.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.434
And I'm all those things
because of both of you.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.230
I wouldn't exist without you.

25:24.397 --> 25:27.150
And I wouldn't be who I am today
without you.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.612
I know it sucks
that mom had an affair.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.907
And I know it sucks
that you had to watch

25:33.949 --> 25:35.534
another man raise your daughter.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.828
But you could look at it
as a gift.

25:38.870 --> 25:42.123
This messy, painful,

25:42.165 --> 25:44.417
dysfunctional path made me
a Charmed One,

25:44.459 --> 25:47.921
and it gave me two dads
who love me.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.298
I love you both.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.134
So just shut the hell up
and do what you're told.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.762
(clears throat) Yes, ma'am.
Got it.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.014
Cool. (scoffs)

25:58.056 --> 26:00.100
Uh, since my powers are
out of whack,

26:00.141 --> 26:02.978
we're gonna have to take
a more direct approach.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.396
And I promise that we will be

26:04.437 --> 26:06.481
on our best behavior
and work together.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.608
No more fighting. Period.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.654
Actually, fighting is exactly
what I want you to do.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.450
(fire crackling)
(owl hooting)

26:21.037 --> 26:22.706
Liquid Devil's Trumpet.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.499
I had to go all the way
to an ogre's house

26:24.541 --> 26:25.834
in the Philippines to get it.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.838
I think I have everything.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.757
Lady's Mantle, snake wart,

26:32.799 --> 26:34.843
young nettle's leaves,

26:34.884 --> 26:38.471
and a pinch of yellow dock.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.599
(bubbling, hissing)

26:41.975 --> 26:43.560
Hard to believe it's this easy.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.979
Look, despite their appearance
and attitude,

26:46.021 --> 26:47.647
the Graiai are known
to be trustworthy.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.566
Their credo--
truth for truth--

26:49.608 --> 26:52.193
has been a binding contract
through time.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.196
Well, then...

26:55.238 --> 26:56.573
here goes nothing.

26:57.657 --> 27:00.410
Three drops,
Liquid Devil's Trumpet.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.080
Now for the spell.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.585
(both grunt)
(women laughing)

27:08.627 --> 27:10.503
Oh...

27:10.545 --> 27:12.714
what the hell was that?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.841
We've been had.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.554
You think you're better
than me because you're taller?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.890
Oh, I know I am
because you're an idiot!
Oh?

27:21.931 --> 27:23.391
RAY: Oh, that's
very eloquent coming

27:23.433 --> 27:25.310
from a guy who's
talking out of his ass!

27:25.352 --> 27:28.063
Oh, so clever, so clever.
What, you must be a big hit

27:28.104 --> 27:30.231
on the Neanderthal
comedy circuit.
(nearby clanging)

27:30.273 --> 27:31.441
Hey. It's working. Keep going.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.942
Uh, uh...

27:32.984 --> 27:35.028
drop dead!
Already did.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.197
RAY:
Well, it's a shame that bowl
didn't take you out sooner.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.240
DEXTER:
I'm waiting with baited breath
for you to kick the bucket.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.201
RAY:
You don't have to tell me
about your breath.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.994
I'm downwind!
Oh, well, from the view up here,

27:43.036 --> 27:44.746
I can see you're going bald
in two places!

27:44.788 --> 27:46.956
RAY:
Says the man with nary
a hair on his head.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.459
DEXTER:
The only difference is I don't
look like a bloated bullfrog.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.670
RAY:
Oh, yeah, well, go to hell!

27:51.711 --> 27:53.755
TRUNKSIE:
Uh-oh.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.840
No, you! You!
You! You!

27:55.882 --> 27:57.425
You!
(rapid footfalls)

27:57.467 --> 27:58.885
(Trunksie giggling)

27:58.927 --> 28:01.388
That little fur-ball is fast.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.889
He's headed towards
the dining room.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.432
Maybe when he shows
his beady little eyes,

28:04.474 --> 28:05.892
we can take a blanket,
throw it over him like a net.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.977
Hold on, anyone
else smell...?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.437
(sniffs)

28:09.479 --> 28:10.980
Gas.

28:11.022 --> 28:14.192
You touch Trunksie again,

28:14.234 --> 28:16.611
house go boom!

28:16.653 --> 28:18.697
Now we play
a new game.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.573
Hide-and-go-seek.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.492
(laughing)

28:25.704 --> 28:28.498
(purring)

28:28.540 --> 28:30.625
Are you purring?

28:32.085 --> 28:34.462
It's a biological
reflex, okay?

28:36.214 --> 28:38.007
(both chuckle)

28:38.049 --> 28:40.135
(sniffles)

28:43.680 --> 28:46.224
You serious about
what you said earlier?

28:47.434 --> 28:49.519
That you'd be
willing to...

28:51.771 --> 28:54.274
...to figure out a way
for everyone to...

28:54.315 --> 28:55.942
Hey.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.653
Are you okay?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.780
Yeah, just
a little dizzy.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.826
You could have
a concussion.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.953
You need to stay awake or...
(rumbling)

29:16.880 --> 29:18.757
They figured it out.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.967
We're gonna get out of here.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.094
Sunny?

29:24.220 --> 29:25.638
Sunny!

29:31.853 --> 29:33.146
Nothing's happening.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.315
You have to smash it first.
What?!

29:35.356 --> 29:37.442
(grunting)

29:38.818 --> 29:40.862
It's the only way
to break the spell.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.489
That seems a bit literal,
doesn't it?

29:42.530 --> 29:44.532
If I smash the globe
before she gets to the portal...

29:44.574 --> 29:46.117
Mel dies.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.244
(grunting)

29:49.162 --> 29:52.081
If you don't smash it within
the next 20 seconds, Mel dies.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.004
(grunting)

30:06.387 --> 30:08.097
Sorry, Mel.
(grunts)

30:19.567 --> 30:21.194
We-we can break it.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.072
Make a rope to lower
Maggie down, so she's safe.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.615
RAY:
There's got to be some sheets

30:25.657 --> 30:27.158
around here somewhere,
we can tie them together.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.576
What?
Let's...

30:28.618 --> 30:30.370
I'm not leaving you alone.
We're not alone.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.789
We got each other.
Right, Ray?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.040
Damn straight.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.875
Together we can take

30:35.917 --> 30:37.752
that little bastard down.
I just...

30:37.794 --> 30:39.838
I just need a minute.
(coughs)

30:39.879 --> 30:41.589
Maggie, you got to let

30:41.631 --> 30:43.258
Ray and I do this
for you, please.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.260
We're your fathers.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.220
It's our job
to protect you.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.722
Macy was just
as stubborn as you are,

30:49.764 --> 30:52.433
and even she knew to listen
to me at times like this.

30:53.434 --> 30:54.936
I need you to do the same.
Wait.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.938
Macy.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.524
I think I have an idea.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.902
(door handle jiggling)

31:04.529 --> 31:06.614
♪ ♪

31:10.910 --> 31:13.454
I'll check the back rooms.
Yeah.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.582
(laughter, clamoring)

31:19.460 --> 31:21.462
(clamoring, whooping)

31:21.504 --> 31:24.507
PAM:
I see you made our recipe.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.801
Yeah.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.595
It was an epic fail.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.263
What happened
to truth for truth?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.390
My sisters.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.766
(chuckles)

31:33.808 --> 31:35.518
They wanted to punish you.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.646
For not holding up
your end.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.231
I told the truth.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.900
The truth in your head.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.401
Maybe.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.028
But not the one in your heart.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.030
Give me another chance.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.539
You have to let go.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.708
Don't be afraid.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.758
(short laugh)

32:06.799 --> 32:08.301
There.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.928
That's it.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.431
Can you feel it?

32:13.473 --> 32:14.807
(exhales)

32:14.849 --> 32:17.310
That's...

32:17.352 --> 32:20.146
really...

32:20.188 --> 32:21.648
(exhales)

32:21.689 --> 32:23.775
That's my...

32:28.529 --> 32:30.365
Don't beat yourself up.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.283
Most people aren't strong
enough to see it.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.576
Even when you show them.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.286
(chuckles)

32:35.328 --> 32:37.205
Oh, right.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.875
Our end of
the bargain.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.879
(echoing): The Lost One is
bound by a curse times three.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.799
Which can be broken
by the Bowl of Unity.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.842
Once risen, the Lost One

32:49.884 --> 32:51.636
will exert its power,

32:51.678 --> 32:54.305
the magical world
changing within an hour.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.141
(normal voice):
See ya.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.698
(chuckles)

33:15.827 --> 33:18.037
Get away from her!
No, Kaela, wait!

33:18.079 --> 33:20.373
(grunting)

33:20.415 --> 33:23.710
What happened to us working
together to change things?

33:23.751 --> 33:26.337
We're not
in snow globe land anymore.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.424
(whimpers)

33:29.465 --> 33:32.760
You almost had me convinced
with all that Kumbaya crap.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.555
Even if we wanted
to change things,

33:35.596 --> 33:37.557
there's all these
other people.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.976
Who will get behind us.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.103
It's just gonna take some time.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.149
I'm not waiting
any longer.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.360
Open a portal
or I open her jugular.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.713
We just saved your ass.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.007
And you sold yours
to the oppressors.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.925
DEV:
Come on, Sunny.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.677
You're not gonna win this.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.930
This is no version where you
are gonna come out on top.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.224
All right, fine, you escape
right now, but do you want to be

34:20.266 --> 34:22.018
on the run
for the rest of your life?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.604
Constantly looking
over your shoulder?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.244
(exhales)

34:41.204 --> 34:43.998
This is a spell
to raise the dead,

34:44.040 --> 34:46.209
like the one you taught Macy
all those years ago.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.336
If my powers are reversed,
it'll kill anything

34:48.377 --> 34:49.837
that shouldn't be alive, so...

34:49.879 --> 34:52.340
Trunksie goes back
to the toy chest, but...

34:52.381 --> 34:54.300
But what?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.803
I think it sends you away,
as well, because...

34:57.845 --> 34:59.597
...you're not supposed
to be out of the Veil.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.976
It's okay.
It's time for me to go.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.937
No, it's not.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.106
There's still so much
I want to know about you.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.398
You know I love you.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.775
That's what matters most.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.736
I can't hold on much longer!

35:13.778 --> 35:16.531
(Trunksie laughing)

35:16.572 --> 35:18.616
For the first time,
I feel complete.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.201
Me, too.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.245
(shouts)

35:22.286 --> 35:23.704
(Trunksie laughs)

35:23.746 --> 35:25.665
Night night.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.042
Maggie, now. No more time.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.629
Angels of Death,
the Lords of the Underworld,

35:31.671 --> 35:33.589
hear my request.
TRUNSKIE: I'm taking you down!

35:33.631 --> 35:35.633
Bring the dead back to life.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.355
(sighs)

35:56.237 --> 35:58.281
Well, here goes nothing.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.075
(slurping)

36:03.077 --> 36:04.662
Well?

36:12.253 --> 36:13.796
Oh, my God.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.548
It worked.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.301
It worked.
Dad.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.428
Thank you.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.806
Thank you for saving
your pig-headed pop.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.601
I'm just...

36:26.642 --> 36:28.728
I'm sorry that we couldn't
do the same for Dexter.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.565
I can't believe I'm actually
gonna say this, but...

36:33.566 --> 36:34.817
I'm actually gonna miss the guy.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.068
(chuckles)

36:36.110 --> 36:37.653
He was a good man.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.822
He's not really gone.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.576
He's a part of me now.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.370
Well, then...

36:46.412 --> 36:49.582
what do you say
we go raise a glass

36:49.624 --> 36:52.251
to your other number one dad?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.920
(chuckles):
Okay.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.256
Thanks for helping me
get Mel out of that trap.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.925
I barely did anything.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.676
You're the one who came up
with the skywriting

37:00.718 --> 37:03.054
and wielded that hammer
like a boss.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.139
(laughs)
"Wielded"?

37:05.181 --> 37:06.641
Well...

37:06.682 --> 37:09.810
if you like
how I wielded that hammer,

37:09.852 --> 37:12.063
you should see what I can do
with other tools.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.941
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.318
Wait.
What?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.903
I am that guy.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.655
What?

37:20.696 --> 37:23.199
The ride-or-die guy--
I'm the guy.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.493
I know, I know.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.286
I'm fun and sexy and all that,

37:27.328 --> 37:28.955
but that's not all I am.

37:28.996 --> 37:31.457
I mean, I helped you
with the conch and your magic

37:31.499 --> 37:33.292
and those killer spiders.

37:33.334 --> 37:37.004
I even got poisoned pretending
to be your boyfriend.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.965
Like, come on!

37:39.006 --> 37:40.591
(laughs)

37:40.633 --> 37:42.885
I have shown up for you.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.472
So if you just want to be
friends with benefits, fine.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.266
But don't put
that on me.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.017
You're making that decision
for the both of us.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.603
Okay, yeah, you're...

37:52.645 --> 37:55.064
You're right. You have been...

37:55.106 --> 37:56.649
great.

37:56.691 --> 38:00.152
There's so much change
happening in my life.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.029
And I'm just trying
to figure out who I am

38:02.071 --> 38:04.156
and who I can trust.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.536
I'm just scared
that if I get all vulnerable

38:08.577 --> 38:11.330
with the wrong person,
I'll just end up getting hurt.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.166
Something tells me
there's a higher probability

38:14.208 --> 38:15.876
of you hurting me.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.339
Okay, well...

38:21.382 --> 38:23.301
Well, how about we just...

38:23.342 --> 38:25.261
agree not to hurt each other?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.721

38:26.762 --> 38:31.183

38:35.813 --> 38:38.941
So, next week, we're
gonna do dinner,

38:38.983 --> 38:41.694
candles, wine, the works.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.155
That's adorable.
Yeah, I...

38:44.196 --> 38:47.908
I usually hate all the cutesy
couple stuff, but...

38:47.950 --> 38:49.994
I don't know,
you only live once, right?

38:50.036 --> 38:51.162
(laughs)

38:51.203 --> 38:52.913
Unless you're Sunny.
Yeah.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.500
Bold choice letting
Psycho Kitty go.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.586
When I heard her story,

38:58.627 --> 39:00.463
her pain was so raw.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.132
Hmm.
And she's not wrong.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.926
The Unseen aren't like any other
enemies we've faced before.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.679
We can't just vanquish them.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.891
We've got to reach them somehow.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.394
I hope there's something strong
in those mugs.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.645
I already got you one.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.950
Where did you get this?

39:30.701 --> 39:35.581
Oh, um, when I had cancer,
I wasn't responding to chemo,

39:35.623 --> 39:37.917
so the doctors told me
about this amazing...

39:37.958 --> 39:39.668
Experimental project.
Yeah.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.961
It saved my life.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.506
And you're upset.

39:43.547 --> 39:44.882
Why-why are you upset?

39:44.924 --> 39:46.884
Maggie, what is it?

39:48.761 --> 39:51.514
When Macy thought Dexter was
dying from cancer, she...

39:53.099 --> 39:56.310
...she tried to save him
by donating her stem cells

39:56.352 --> 39:58.187
to the...

39:58.229 --> 39:59.939
Progenitor Project.

40:02.316 --> 40:07.071
So you're saying that I have
Macy's stem cells?

40:07.113 --> 40:08.864
She saved my life.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.866
And she gave you your magic.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.330
So we're chosen sisters, but...

40:16.372 --> 40:18.416
we're also real sisters?

40:18.457 --> 40:19.750
(laughs quietly)

40:22.503 --> 40:24.213
(chuckles)

40:25.756 --> 40:27.299
(short laugh)

40:30.219 --> 40:32.430
JORDAN:
Thanks for getting
the bowl from Maggie.

40:32.471 --> 40:34.974
I'm just not ready
to see her.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.601
What did the Graiai show you?

40:37.643 --> 40:39.728
I saw...

40:41.564 --> 40:45.901
...what I've been feeling
but didn't really want to admit.

40:48.529 --> 40:52.116
I love Maggie.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.618
Mm.
But...

40:54.660 --> 40:57.746
I don't love
how we were as a couple.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.958
And if getting
back together means

41:01.000 --> 41:03.085
keeping that spin cycle going...

41:06.839 --> 41:09.758
...I'd rather just let her go.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.636
(sniffles)

41:12.678 --> 41:14.221
(exhales)

41:14.263 --> 41:16.056
I don't know about you,
but I really want

41:16.098 --> 41:17.600
to smash something.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.563
HARRY:
Well, how about...

41:23.939 --> 41:25.900
...a bowl that can unbind
the Lost One?
