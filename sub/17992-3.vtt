want me to do, baby?

08:22.969 --> 08:23.903
You want me to talk to her?

08:23.970 --> 08:24.737
I will.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.172
Some people you
gotta [bleep] check.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.673
We gonna talk to her and
I'm going to show you

08:27.740 --> 08:28.875
how I communicate.

08:28.941 --> 08:32.845
Well, I hope so,
because I'm tired of it.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.148
{\an8}I've been there for her
when nobody else is for her.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.583
{\an8}People throw her to the side,
but are you really going

08:38.650 --> 08:39.885
{\an8}to do that to me?

08:39.952 --> 08:40.886
{\an8}I know, and it hurts.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.087
{\an8}I'm tired of it.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.522
{\an8}Who is Masika?

08:43.589 --> 08:44.423
{\an8}She is a friend.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.358
{\an8}So, where do you guys stand now?

08:45.424 --> 08:46.192
{\an8}We're done.

{\an8}I am emotionally exhausted
because I love him so much.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.502
{\an8}I'm trying to just
ask you how you feel.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.004
{\an8}I don't like you.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.039

don't know [bleep] about music.

09:05.111 --> 09:13.886
♪♪

09:13.953 --> 09:19.125
♪♪

09:19.191 --> 09:22.161
I had Teairra's back when
Ray came for her at the

09:22.228 --> 09:23.629
tattoo party, but I'm
still pissed at the way

09:23.696 --> 09:25.264
she dogged me out with Burg.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.700
Meanwhile, she's still obsessed
with the man that she broke up

09:27.767 --> 09:30.603
with eight months ago.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.471
But maybe I'm crazy, so I
called my girl Jazz to

09:32.538 --> 09:34.307
get another perspective.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.308
What color are you going to get?

09:35.374 --> 09:36.409
Red.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.678
Jazz has known
Teairra for a minute.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.380
She was actually at the party
when all the drama went down.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.949
She witnessed it first hand.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.584
So, what's been going
on after the party?

09:45.651 --> 09:49.322
First of all, T been
getting out of pocket.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.692
When she drink we know she's
going to go from zero to 100,

09:52.758 --> 09:54.560
which is probably what has
hindered her in her career

09:54.627 --> 09:55.962
in this industry.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.930
So, it's like I'm over here
trying to explain what's going

09:57.997 --> 09:59.732
on with me and Burg, but it's
like if it's not about her and

09:59.799 --> 10:01.667
{\an5}Ray, she don't want to talk
about it, but it's like

10:01.734 --> 10:02.835
it's not fair.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.171
{\an5}We all have our issues and
certain things hold us back.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.272
What do you think her issue is?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.341
Same as the issue I
used to have, drinking.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.644
So, I understand, but it
doesn't make it acceptable.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.712
Maybe she need to go to rehab.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.046
That could be.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.982
We're not just friends, we've
been roommates for almost

10:16.048 --> 10:17.783
two years now.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.453
I've watched her turn selfish
and mean and the drinking,

10:20.519 --> 10:22.555
it just makes things worse.

10:22.621 --> 10:25.224
Maybe it's because
she's depressed over Ray.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.294
But she can't just turn up
and disrespect me anytime

10:28.361 --> 10:29.562
she wants to.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.097
As soon as I say one thing you
don't like, you think you can

10:31.163 --> 10:33.432
just turn on me.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.533
It's like first of all I
should sock you in your

10:34.600 --> 10:37.336
[bleep] mouth, because that's
what I wanted to do.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.305
But I'm not trying to beat on T
because she's already been

10:39.372 --> 10:40.773
beat up enough out here.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.774
You gonna put your hands on her?

10:41.841 --> 10:43.509
I don't want to
put my hands on her.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.645
But I will because maybe that
will get her back in her bag

10:46.712 --> 10:48.447
because she thinks she can do
that and then come back and

10:48.514 --> 10:50.783
be BFFs two days later.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.885
I think that's the issue too,
she turns up on people

10:52.952 --> 10:55.621
that are close to her.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.690
You really going
to do that to me?

10:57.757 --> 11:02.428
When Ray J did break up with
you, you had nobody to go to

11:02.495 --> 11:05.598
and he put you out, who
came and picked you up.

11:05.664 --> 11:08.567
I've been there for her
when nobody else is for her.

11:08.634 --> 11:11.337
Like, people throw her
to the side, to the left.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.438
I know, and it hurts.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.740
I'm tired of it, for real.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.942
Maybe we've been in each
other's face too much.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.677
Her house sitting gig is over
with and now she's back

11:18.744 --> 11:20.179

11:20.246 --> 11:22.815
Honestly, I don't know how
much more I can take of this.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.550
I feel like I'm living in my
home with somebody

11:24.617 --> 11:26.118
I don't even know.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.355
I'm not fixing to sit here and
take your [bleep] no more, T.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.490
Get help and figure it out
and I'll still love you

11:31.557 --> 11:32.558
from a distance.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.060
I love you, I want
to have love for you.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.495
And therefore we can see if the
sisterhood is really there like

11:36.562 --> 11:38.197
I think it is, I hope it is.

going to let her talk to me.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.333
"She feels some type of way."

16:07.399 --> 16:09.068
But why are you
talking to me like that?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.469
I'm with your son every day.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.371
Be respectful, don't disrespect.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.639
Exactly, be like thank you.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.074
That's why I was explaining to
you I feel like you should have

16:15.140 --> 16:18.210
waited for me to figure
things out with her so I can.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.279
Moniece wanted to talk to me
and it's like two years later,

16:20.346 --> 16:21.413
two years later.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.015
Right, and you need
to talk to Drew first.

16:23.082 --> 16:23.882
Period.

16:23.949 --> 16:24.717
Period.

16:24.783 --> 16:26.585
And then maybe
I'll introduce you.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.387
This is the kind of conversation
that needs to happen and it

16:28.454 --> 16:29.922
needs to happen now because I'm
not okay with the way that it

16:29.988 --> 16:31.590
ended and the way
with her leaving.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.325
And it was like a
waste of a conversation.

16:33.392 --> 16:34.560
I understand that.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.095
So, if you think you should
talk to her first, this is your

16:36.161 --> 16:38.897
opportunity to make it right,
and to fix it, because I can't

16:38.964 --> 16:40.966
go forward with the
way that it ended.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.401
And I think you should go talk
to her, because ultimately her

16:42.468 --> 16:44.370
problem isn't with her.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.170
Right, it's with me.

16:45.237 --> 16:46.372
Yeah.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.273
I understand that and I will go
talk to her because to me

16:48.340 --> 16:49.375
it's disrespectful.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.844
You don't do those things.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.245
You're crossing the boundaries.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.514
So, Amanda went and met up with
Moniece and there was nothing

16:55.581 --> 16:57.416
I could do to stop her.

16:57.483 --> 16:58.550
She just got a taste of
what I've been dealing

16:58.617 --> 17:00.085
with for years.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.254
But Moniece can't just
disrespect my girl like that.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.589
So, as much as I want
to steer clear of her,

17:04.656 --> 17:07.259
I will have to handle this.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.260
I will step up, I will say
something to her,

17:08.327 --> 17:09.494
I will talk to her.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.130
Because i just feel like at
the end of the day I love you,

17:11.195 --> 17:12.830
I love Cameron.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.532
And that's what
it's about to me.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.603
It's about doing something full
and having a happy family,

17:17.669 --> 17:18.503
you know what I mean.

17:18.569 --> 17:19.738
I'm going to talk to her.

17:19.805 --> 17:20.973
I'm going to do that.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.241
Thank you.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.175
That's so -- I love y'all.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.477
So, on that note, I'm going to
go ahead and make a toast

17:25.544 --> 17:26.845
to no drama.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.681
No drama for your momma.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.083
No drama with the mommas.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.518
No dramas with the mommas.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.286
I like that better.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.821
{\an8}This girl came at
me, she was fake.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.157
{\an8}I read the [bleep]
after a couple of weeks.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.558
{\an8}I cut if off, whatever.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.627
{\an8}I'm his bitch, like
for real, I'm his bitch.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.663
{\an8}But do you think that
you're like his girlfriend?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.064
{\an8}I mean, I get it.

17:46.131 --> 17:52.404
♪♪

17:59.445 --> 18:01.313
Mally's been blowing up my phone
and trying to sweet talk me

18:01.380 --> 18:02.414
and send me flowers.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.415
What's up, baby?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.583
Hey, baby.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.218
But he's been having these
photos all over the internet

18:06.285 --> 18:08.120
with his little
jump off, Masika.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.121
How have you been?

18:09.188 --> 18:09.788
Been good?

18:09.855 --> 18:10.522
So-so.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.290
So-so.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.524
Little upset?

18:12.591 --> 18:14.793
Yeah, I have a couple of things
I want to talk to you about.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.762
The only reason I agreed to have
a drink with him is to hear

18:16.829 --> 18:18.697
what he wanted to say.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.999
I don't care if we're on a break
for a second, a minute,

18:21.066 --> 18:23.902
I will not be disrespected,
especially not by a ho.

18:23.969 --> 18:27.473
Me and you, we spent
over a year together.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.941
You know, we get in a
little petty fight.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.342
{\an5}Oh, you got your
ring on, so sweet.

18:30.409 --> 18:31.777
Yeah, does it have
any meaning behind it?

18:31.844 --> 18:32.811
You think so?

18:32.878 --> 18:33.846
I'm asking you.

18:33.912 --> 18:34.680
What do you think?

18:34.746 --> 18:35.881
Of course.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.483
I don't know, that's what
I'm here to clear up, I guess.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.018
Mally gave me this promise ring
when we were together, so even

18:40.085 --> 18:43.222
when we're on a break, this
ring means that he's still mine.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.325
Who is Masika?

18:46.391 --> 18:47.459
Um, well, you know,
she's a friend that

18:47.526 --> 18:48.527
I met through Bieber.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.830
Jump off, you met
through Bieber?

18:51.897 --> 18:54.299
Me and Masika met and we talk
about doing some music together.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.167
Okay.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.201
I'm not going to
front, but she was cool.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.436
Me and her work together.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.470
I was like, "Hey, it's cool.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.671
"We can try it out.

18:59.738 --> 19:00.539
"We can date."

19:00.606 --> 19:01.807
You know what I mean?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.709
To be honest with you, I feel
humiliated, I feel disrespected.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.577
My girlfriends are
sending me pictures.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.246
I'm getting tagged in
your Instagram pictures.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.349
You let the girl post
pictures in your bed.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.284
You can check her,
you can control her.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.152
Were you guys [bleep]?

19:14.219 --> 19:15.854
Just be honest with me.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.223
Me and her messed around, but
sexually we -- like we messed

19:18.290 --> 19:20.759
around orally and stuff,
but it never went that far.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.827
You never had sex?

19:21.894 --> 19:22.461
No.

19:22.528 --> 19:23.529
Okay.

19:23.595 --> 19:24.663
I'm saying we were in
bed together, everything,

19:24.730 --> 19:25.497
you know I don't care.

19:25.564 --> 19:26.131
I would tell you.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.232
I know.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.534
You can't be mad at me
because we weren't together.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.902
The whole time I
was with you, you know,

19:29.968 --> 19:31.036
it was just me and you.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.804
I'm seeing that she's
saying that, "I love my man."

19:32.871 --> 19:34.006
Which was.

19:34.072 --> 19:35.107
"We know everything about each
other", and I'm thinking,

19:35.173 --> 19:36.909
"How long have you been
involved with her?"

19:36.975 --> 19:37.943
Exactly.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.644
A month?

19:38.710 --> 19:39.478
It wasn't even a month.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.312
Two weeks?

19:40.379 --> 19:41.747
It was about two or three weeks.

19:41.813 --> 19:42.681
So, where do you guys stand now?

19:42.748 --> 19:43.649
We're done.

19:43.715 --> 19:44.616
We're nothing.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.551
Does she know that?

19:45.617 --> 19:47.052
We're cool, there's
nothing between us.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.153
The past is the past.

19:48.220 --> 19:48.820
We're here.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.088
So.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.391
I'm here to come clean about it
and be real, like I'm not saying

19:52.457 --> 19:53.425
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.027
This girl came at me
about doing music.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.228
She was fake.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.463
I read the [bleep]
after a couple of weeks.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.698
I cut it off, whatever.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.067
So, I'm here to be cool, to
fix this, to make this better.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.035
Okay.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.069
We're not breaking up.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.704
I'm wrong, I get it.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.072
Okay, that's all I
wanted you to say.

20:07.139 --> 20:07.873
And I apologize.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.874
Okay.

20:08.941 --> 20:09.775
Now, give me a kiss, come here.

20:09.841 --> 20:10.943
Okay.

20:11.009 --> 20:11.843
See, okay.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.644
So, we're good.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.079
I want to be with
you, obviously.

20:14.146 --> 20:14.947
You obviously want
to be with me, right?

20:15.013 --> 20:16.381
Right?

20:16.448 --> 20:17.583
Yeah.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.384
Okay, so whatever I did to hurt
your feelings, I apologize

20:19.451 --> 20:20.452
and let's build on it, okay.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.320
Okay.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.388
That's all I needed to hear.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.324
Whatever this trick thought
that she had with Mally

20:25.390 --> 20:28.226
is just her little
imagination running itself.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.494
Give me a hug.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.296
Me and my man have been together
for a long time and there's no

20:31.363 --> 20:33.231
video bitch who's going
to come in between us.

20:33.298 --> 20:34.700
Come here, give me a
hug, give me a real hug.

20:34.766 --> 20:35.634
Give me all the boob.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.703
Okay, I love you.

20:37.769 --> 20:38.503
I love you too.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.038
How much?

20:40.105 --> 20:43.208
You'll find out later.

kiss my butterfly, butterfly. ♪

20:57.856 --> 21:01.526

and negative that
Ray J has to offer.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.669
And after all the craziness at
the tattoo party, I pretty much

21:10.736 --> 21:13.972
have locked myself in
a recording studio.

What better way to mend my

Hi.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.424
I know, right.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.926
I popped in on TT at the
studio because we definitely

21:34.993 --> 21:36.328
need to talk.

21:36.395 --> 21:39.031
Things are just getting more and
more uncomfortable between us

21:39.097 --> 21:42.067
and I think it's time for us
to clear up a couple of things.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.869
I haven't really had a
chance to talk to you since

21:43.935 --> 21:45.437
the tattoo party.

21:45.504 --> 21:46.705
It got cray up in that bitch.

21:46.772 --> 21:47.773
It got very cray.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.641
Before all the Ray
J [bleep] even happened,

21:49.708 --> 21:51.843
you know what I'm saying, I'm
trying to tell you about

21:51.910 --> 21:55.080
my situation with Burg, I
wanted to vent to you and the

21:55.147 --> 21:56.948
other people that were
there, you know what I'm saying?

21:57.015 --> 22:00.786
I just felt like, you know,
that wasn't the time or place.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.655
It was making it about you and
it was about me in that moment.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.525
The reason we put the tattoo
party together was for me to

22:06.591 --> 22:08.293
get the tattoo removed.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.363
Listen, everything has a time
and a place and that night was

22:11.430 --> 22:14.733
about getting Ray's
name removed off of me.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.968
And Hazel tried to make
it about her and Burg.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.705
I just don't understand what
she doesn't get about that.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.139
At that moment I
needed you to be a friend

22:21.206 --> 22:22.407
and support me through.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.510
You do need a friend, and that's
what I'm saying, like you expect

22:25.577 --> 22:28.346
me to be that friend and I don't
feel like you know how to be

22:28.413 --> 22:29.014
that friend back.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.215
Okay, so what you do think?

22:30.282 --> 22:31.616
Through this friendship,
through this relationship,

22:31.683 --> 22:33.485
it's all about Teairra.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.420
Really?

22:35.487 --> 22:36.655
Half the time I'm like when
you're drinking, when you're not

22:36.722 --> 22:38.256
sober, or whatever, you don't
even remember what happens.

22:38.323 --> 22:39.491
I'm still a good
friend with you.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.560
before you even lived with me,
I couldn't stay where I was.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.628
What did I say?

22:43.695 --> 22:45.097
I'm not roommate material.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.331
You was like, "Okay, cool."

22:46.398 --> 22:49.000
You always sitting there
listening to you, giving you

22:49.067 --> 22:50.969
encouragement,
and you know that.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.606
But like every time I bring up
the situation with Burg, I feel

22:54.673 --> 22:57.476
like it's kind of a joke to you,
like, "Girl, that doesn't equate

22:57.542 --> 22:59.411
"to what happened
with me and Ray."

22:59.478 --> 23:01.680
And it's like, "How doesn't
it equate because of

23:01.747 --> 23:02.881
"what's going on?"

23:02.948 --> 23:07.686
I think it doesn't equate
because it's not a relationship.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.654
I'm his bitch more than ever.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.590
I'm his bitch, for
real, I'm his bitch.
