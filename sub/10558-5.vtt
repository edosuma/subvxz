00:54.468 --> 00:56.448
The farm hands are on their way in.

00:56.448 --> 00:58.508
Should I fetch Charlotte?

00:58.508 --> 01:01.468
No. Leave her be.
This will just set her off.

01:01.468 --> 01:05.227
Is he still in his room? Last time I
checked he was asleep on the settee.

01:06.268 --> 01:07.788
Let's go wake him up.

ALL: Happy birthday!

01:25.088 --> 01:27.288
SHE SCREAMS

01:39.748 --> 01:42.608
What do we know, George?

01:42.608 --> 01:45.908
Very little thus far, sir. Higgins
and I just got here ourselves.

01:45.908 --> 01:49.908
Do we have a name? Alexander Taylor.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.788
He was discovered by his wife,
son and two farm hands.

01:52.788 --> 01:55.088
They had gathered to celebrate
his 60th birthday.

02:07.263 --> 02:08.603
Where are the witnesses?

02:14.483 --> 02:17.803
Detective, we have Bernice Taylor,
wife of the victim.

02:17.803 --> 02:22.243
Joshua, his son, and the
two farm hands, Clive Brewster
and Norman Copps.

02:22.243 --> 02:26.763
Why are you wasting time
talking to us? We know who did it.

02:26.763 --> 02:29.503
You do? It was my daughter!

02:29.503 --> 02:33.323
She's in her room. She's locked
the door and she won't come out.

02:33.323 --> 02:35.003
We don't know it's her, Mother.

02:35.003 --> 02:37.943
Don't be stupid,
who else would it be?

02:39.583 --> 02:43.923
Her name is Charlotte
and you should be very careful.

02:49.203 --> 02:54.063
Miss Taylor? Detective Murdoch of
the Toronto Police. I'd like to have
a word with you.

02:57.903 --> 02:58.863
Miss Taylor?

03:01.763 --> 03:02.863
Force the door.

03:02.863 --> 03:05.263
Stand back inside. We're coming in!

03:17.603 --> 03:19.483
I'm sorry!

03:20.723 --> 03:22.463
I'm sorry.

03:24.523 --> 03:26.683
What are you sorry for?

03:28.303 --> 03:29.263
I killed Daddy.

03:32.643 --> 03:34.383
I see.

03:34.383 --> 03:37.443
I think I've got
the devil inside me.

03:37.443 --> 03:40.463
Miss Taylor, please give me the axe.

03:44.363 --> 03:45.643
Give it to me.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.463
Give me the axe. Now.

03:48.463 --> 03:50.103
No!

03:52.063 --> 03:54.263
NO, no, no!

04:00.663 --> 04:03.003
How is the arm, George?
She broke the skin, sir.

04:03.003 --> 04:06.123
There's quite a bit of bruising.
My uniform took the brunt of it.

04:06.123 --> 04:07.903
I think
she swallowed my cuff-link.

04:09.203 --> 04:11.163
How is the prisoner this morning?

04:11.163 --> 04:14.403
She seems docile now,
even somewhat disconsolate.

04:14.403 --> 04:18.043
George, she admits to killing her
father and faces death by hanging.

04:18.043 --> 04:20.343
All good cause for sober
self-reflection.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.583
I don't care if
she's dancing the Gay Gordon.

04:22.583 --> 04:25.283
If she signs a confession,
we'll argue for leniency.

04:25.283 --> 04:28.343
I don't want this to turn into
another Lizzie Borden fiasco.

04:28.343 --> 04:31.863
She made the whole police department
look like complete bloody fools.

04:33.643 --> 04:35.283
Who's Gay Gordon?

04:35.283 --> 04:37.303
Scottish, I believe.

04:45.723 --> 04:47.663
Good morning, Miss Taylor.

04:50.283 --> 04:52.563
I'm Detective Murdoch.

04:52.563 --> 04:55.663
Do you remember me?
Were you the one I bit?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.563
No.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.663
That was Constable Crabtree.

04:59.663 --> 05:01.703
Please convey my apologies to him.

05:02.723 --> 05:05.623
I will.

05:05.623 --> 05:09.343
Miss Taylor, as you no doubt are
aware, murder is a capital offence.

05:10.943 --> 05:16.643
But, if you're willing to co-operate
and sign a full confession,
we will argue for leniency.

05:16.643 --> 05:19.743
Do you understand? Yes, of course.

05:20.843 --> 05:22.303
All right...

05:26.783 --> 05:31.403
Miss Taylor, did you strike
your father in the chest with
an axe last night?

05:31.403 --> 05:34.263
Yes, I believe I did.

05:36.443 --> 05:38.263
And why did you kill your father?

05:39.843 --> 05:41.623
I'm possessed by the devil.

05:47.283 --> 05:51.183
Miss Taylor, I'm afraid the courts
won't accept a confession from
someone who claims

05:51.183 --> 05:52.923
the devil made them do it.

05:52.923 --> 05:55.323
But it's the truth.

06:02.503 --> 06:08.383
Miss Taylor, Charlotte,
did your father beat you?

06:11.723 --> 06:12.683
Maybe.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.183
Is that why you killed him?

06:18.383 --> 06:23.343
I don't remember. Miss Taylor...
It's the truth. I don't remember.

06:25.303 --> 06:28.663
This girl is willing to sign a
confession but you won't let her?

06:28.663 --> 06:32.183
Sounds familiar. She doesn't
remember committing the crime, sir.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.063
Only standing over the bloodied
body with an axe in her hand.

06:35.063 --> 06:38.283
After she plunged it into his chest.
This isn't unprecedented.

06:38.283 --> 06:43.083
People have been known to block out
memories of traumatic events. It's
called hysterical amnesia.

06:43.083 --> 06:47.983
Anyone could have killed Mr Taylor
during Charlotte's black-out.
You know the game she's playing.

06:47.983 --> 06:52.343
She feigns co-operation hoping
to avoid the noose, yet leaves
the door open for acquittal.

06:52.343 --> 06:55.043
This woman is clearly disturbed.

06:55.043 --> 06:57.763
Of course. Nobody sticks an axe
through Daddy's ribs

06:57.763 --> 06:59.743
unless they've got
a few bats in the belfry.

06:59.743 --> 07:05.323
I understand you're concerned
and if Charlotte Taylor committed
the crime we'll find out.

07:05.323 --> 07:07.023
"If."

07:08.323 --> 07:12.363
One blow to the upper chest.
Missed the heart but severed the
left pulmonary artery.

07:12.363 --> 07:15.203
Death would have been quick.

07:15.203 --> 07:18.463
Yes, but if he was asleep
it certainly would
have awakened him.

07:20.703 --> 07:24.963
What sort of blood spatter would
you expect from a wound such as this?

07:24.963 --> 07:27.863
Miss Taylor had almost
no blood on her clothing.

07:27.863 --> 07:31.963
The dynamics are difficult to
predict. One must account for the
recoil of the ribs

07:31.963 --> 07:34.903
as well as the pressurised
spray from the severed artery.

07:34.903 --> 07:38.003
Is it possible she could
have escaped such spatter?

07:38.003 --> 07:43.863
It's possible, yes. Likely? No.
I would have expected her
to be fairly drenched in the stuff.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.263
She's savage.

07:47.263 --> 07:51.283
She's an arm-biting,
axe-wielding savage.

07:51.283 --> 07:56.983
George, I need you to return to
that property and look for any items
of clothing with blood on them.

07:56.983 --> 08:01.303
Yes, sir. Also, we'll need
to speak to anyone who was
in or around that house

08:01.303 --> 08:04.023
in the hour prior to the body
being discovered.

08:04.023 --> 08:06.543
It would appear her brother
Joshua is already here.

08:12.543 --> 08:14.643
Please, sir. I wish
to see my sister.

08:14.643 --> 08:17.043
I'm afraid access
to prisoners is restricted.

08:17.043 --> 08:18.643
But I must see her.

08:18.643 --> 08:21.423
She needs me. She's very fragile.

08:21.423 --> 08:24.463
Begging your pardon, she didn't
appear that fragile last night.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.643
I don't mean in a physical way.

08:26.643 --> 08:28.623
She's mentally unwell.

08:28.623 --> 08:34.763
Oh? Her behaviour can be erratic,
especially when she's upset.

08:34.763 --> 08:36.462
Has she been violent before?

08:36.462 --> 08:38.222
Never without provocation.

08:38.222 --> 08:40.043
But if she was provoked?

08:40.043 --> 08:43.082
Then it would be
self-defence, would it not?

08:43.082 --> 08:50.703
My father was a cruel and angry man
especially when he was drunk.
Was he drunk last night?

08:50.703 --> 08:53.123
He was drunk every night.

08:53.123 --> 08:55.103
I'm not sorry that he's dead.

08:55.103 --> 08:59.203
I know that's a terrible thing for
a son to say, but it's the truth.

08:59.203 --> 09:02.283
And what were you doing last
night between seven and eight pm?

09:02.283 --> 09:04.643
Am I a suspect then?

09:04.643 --> 09:06.303
That will depend on your answer.

09:07.983 --> 09:13.503
I was in my room until just before
eight, then went to the kitchen
to join the birthday celebration.

09:14.883 --> 09:16.483
Can anyone confirm this?

09:16.483 --> 09:21.443
I'm sorry, no.
Now can I please see Charlotte?

09:21.443 --> 09:24.303
She needs to know she's not alone.

09:34.703 --> 09:38.723
Joshua! It's all right.

09:38.723 --> 09:41.623
I'm here. I'm here.

09:47.463 --> 09:51.663
Sir... I'm afraid we haven't found
any garments with blood on them.

09:51.663 --> 09:54.803
They've probably been disposed
of by now, but keep looking.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.783
I've informed Bernice Taylor
and the farm hands that you'll be
interviewing them.

09:58.783 --> 10:00.283
Let's start with the farm hands.

10:02.103 --> 10:05.983
You were in the bunkhouse between
seven and eight except for a period
of 15 minutes

10:05.983 --> 10:07.683
when you went to buy pipe tobacco?

10:07.683 --> 10:08.683
That's right.

10:09.623 --> 10:15.303
The store is 300 yards away,
it shouldn't take you more than three
or four minutes either direction.

10:15.303 --> 10:18.363
Yet, according to
the other farm hand, you took 15?

10:18.363 --> 10:22.043
I don't know why
you're talking to me. It's
obvious who done the old man in.

10:22.043 --> 10:23.723
Who's that?

10:23.723 --> 10:27.063
That... Loony daughter.

10:27.063 --> 10:29.383
Off her bloody nut, she is.

10:29.383 --> 10:32.143
Spends her days on the swing,
watching us work.

10:32.143 --> 10:34.843
Sucking her thumb
like a little girl.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.643
Clive didn't seem to mind but...

10:39.223 --> 10:41.303
..she gave me the creeps.

10:41.303 --> 10:43.403
Did she ever talk about her father?

10:44.563 --> 10:47.623
As in, "I'm going to bury
an axe in his chest?" No.

10:47.623 --> 10:51.263
She didn't like her
father much, nobody did.

10:51.263 --> 10:54.303
She was more afraid
of him than anything.

10:55.903 --> 10:57.503
What did you think of him?

10:57.503 --> 10:59.403
We got on.

10:59.403 --> 11:01.563
But I get on with
pretty much everybody.

11:01.563 --> 11:07.323
Mr Brewster, where were you during
the 15-minute period when
Mr Copps went to buy pipe tobacco?

11:07.323 --> 11:09.163
It wasn't me that killed him, sir.

11:10.783 --> 11:14.583
But if my opinion matters at all,
I don't think it was her
that done it, neither.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.223
Why would you say that?

11:17.223 --> 11:19.903
Because it just don't seem like
the girl I've come to know.

11:19.903 --> 11:22.443
You know who I think done it?

11:22.443 --> 11:25.363
It was that woman
who calls herself her mother.

11:26.563 --> 11:28.043
Me?

11:28.043 --> 11:31.383
You have the murderer in custody.
She confessed.

11:31.383 --> 11:33.583
Not exactly.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.743
She can't take responsibility
for her actions is what it is.

11:36.743 --> 11:39.703
She may be crazy as a March hare
but she's not an innocent.

11:39.703 --> 11:42.163
Believe me. Really?

11:42.163 --> 11:46.763
We tried, we really did. Alex took
a firm hand but it did no good.

11:46.763 --> 11:50.623
He always thought she was either
crazy or evil.

11:50.623 --> 11:52.563
I've thought it was a bit of both.

11:52.563 --> 11:56.103
Where were you during the hour
prior to finding your husband's body?

11:57.003 --> 12:00.723
I split my time between the kitchen
and the dining room.

12:00.723 --> 12:03.863
At about 7.40 I went
upstairs to put on my good dress.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.563
It was his birthday after all.

12:07.003 --> 12:09.823
You were alone? For the most part.

12:09.823 --> 12:13.003
So no-one can confirm your
whereabouts during that time?

12:14.163 --> 12:16.223
That's right.

12:16.223 --> 12:18.323
Bernice Taylor was in the kitchen.

12:18.323 --> 12:23.083
Charlotte was in her bedroom,
which was across the hall
from Alexander Taylor's study.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.323
The son, Joshua, was in his bedroom.

12:25.323 --> 12:26.963
Where was the axe?

12:26.963 --> 12:30.203
Buried in a log outside the porch.

12:30.203 --> 12:36.543
Whoever killed Alexander Taylor would
have retrieved the axe and accessed
the study by way of these stairs.

12:36.543 --> 12:41.403
Presumably the killer would have
exited the same way. It would have
taken less than two minutes.

12:41.403 --> 12:44.883
So what you're saying is, Charlotte,
or any of these four,
could have done it?

12:44.883 --> 12:46.483
Yes.

12:46.483 --> 12:49.123
Bloody marvellous!

12:49.123 --> 12:51.923
It's as I was saying... Sir?

12:51.923 --> 12:55.063
Everyone is in different parts of
the house. No-one sees anything.

12:55.063 --> 12:57.883
Daddy gets axed and she walks.

12:57.883 --> 13:01.023
It's Lizzie Borden all over again!

13:01.023 --> 13:05.063
I'm not going to stand by
while some smartass turns this
into a nursery rhyme.

13:05.063 --> 13:08.883
Let's get her back into the
interview room. I'll
take a crack at her myself.

13:11.383 --> 13:15.863
You plunged an axe into your
father's chest and now you're saying
you don't remember it?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.043
I only remember pulling it out.

13:18.043 --> 13:22.463
That's bloody convenient, isn't it?
Does this happen to you a lot, this
forgetting business?

13:22.463 --> 13:24.383
Yes. Does it?

13:24.383 --> 13:26.743
I often forget bad things I've done.

13:26.743 --> 13:29.423
That's how I know I'm possessed.

13:29.423 --> 13:32.583
Listen to me, missy.
I'm onto your game.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.543
Do you think this ploy is
going to help you escape the noose?

13:35.543 --> 13:40.563
No. Good. Because it won't! A jury
of your peers will see right
through your wide-eyed innocent act

13:40.563 --> 13:43.123
to the cunning little
schemer you are. I'm not...

13:43.123 --> 13:45.603
And they will hang you
until you're dead.

13:48.743 --> 13:52.423
You may not remember your neck
breaking as the rope snaps taught

13:52.423 --> 13:56.043
but sure as I'm standing
here you're going to feel it! No!

13:57.163 --> 14:01.003
Leave her alone! Sir...
I've a good mind to...

14:01.003 --> 14:02.683
Go on, I'll claw your eyes out.

14:02.683 --> 14:05.623
Sir, please.
Leave her alone with me for a moment.

14:09.643 --> 14:12.503
What's the matter?
Are you scared of me?

14:15.443 --> 14:18.443
What did you mean, "Leave her alone?"
Leave who alone?

14:21.403 --> 14:22.423
Charlotte.

14:25.843 --> 14:30.523
But you're Charlotte.
No, Charlotte's gone away for a bit.

14:34.043 --> 14:35.063
Then who are you?

14:36.243 --> 14:39.223
I'm her guardian angel.

14:39.223 --> 14:40.843
You can call me Maddie.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.223
You're Charlotte's guardian angel?

14:48.823 --> 14:52.923
Well, maybe not an angel.

14:52.923 --> 14:55.103
I watch over her.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.683
Charlotte's weak, you know.

14:57.683 --> 14:59.483
Someone's got to watch out for her.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.503
By striking a police inspector?

15:01.503 --> 15:03.803
Your inspector's a big boy.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.303
He can handle it.

15:06.963 --> 15:10.343
Where is Charlotte now? I don't know.

15:13.983 --> 15:16.203
Is Charlotte aware of you?

15:16.203 --> 15:20.623
No. You'd think she would be after
all the situations I've left her in.

15:21.743 --> 15:26.343
The thing is, I have no control
over when Charlotte comes back.

15:26.343 --> 15:31.543
Is that why Charlotte has no
recollection of killing her father?

15:31.543 --> 15:32.983
Because you did.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.083
Maddie?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.663
Who's Maddie?

15:42.663 --> 15:47.063
You're telling me there's
two women occupying the same body?

15:47.063 --> 15:48.823
The same brain?

15:48.823 --> 15:53.103
Dual personalities are rare
but they have been reported
in medical literature.

15:53.103 --> 15:55.543
But what of the soul, sir?
We're only allotted one.

15:55.543 --> 15:58.963
Does that soul split into two?
Half go to heaven, half go to hell?

15:58.963 --> 16:00.283
I don't know, George.

16:00.283 --> 16:05.223
What if one of the personalities
committed the murder without the
knowledge of the other,

16:05.223 --> 16:07.143
do they both hang?
That doesn't seem fair.

16:07.143 --> 16:09.223
That's what the lass
is counting on, isn't it?

16:09.223 --> 16:12.743
Sir, her family has noted
her instability for years.

16:12.743 --> 16:16.543
If this is all a diabolical scheme,
she's been planning it for some time.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.363
All right.

16:18.363 --> 16:23.043
Assuming there's a germ of truth
to this claptrap, you're saying
it was this Maddie who did it?

16:23.043 --> 16:24.763
She clearly has violent tendencies.

16:24.763 --> 16:26.903
So what's your next step?

16:28.443 --> 16:30.163
Consult with an expert.

16:32.103 --> 16:35.023
I came as soon as I heard.
I appreciate it, Dr Roberts.

16:35.023 --> 16:37.163
Did I understand
the telegram correctly?

16:37.163 --> 16:40.243
Do you really have a case of
dual personality on you hands?

16:40.243 --> 16:42.943
It appears so.
Have you ever dealt with such a case?

16:42.943 --> 16:46.903
Regrettably, no,
they're extremely rare,
but it's a fascinating condition!

16:48.683 --> 16:52.363
This is Charlotte Taylor,
shy, withdrawn.

16:52.363 --> 16:56.123
But her alter ego, Maddie,
is quite the opposite.

16:56.123 --> 17:03.183
Detective, I would very much
like to study Miss Taylor, but
I realise you have your own agenda.

17:03.183 --> 17:06.123
Yes, I need to find out
what happened in that house.

17:06.123 --> 17:09.683
Whether she's guilty or not, I'm
convinced this woman holds the key.

17:11.282 --> 17:14.323
I'm possessed by the devil.
Do you really believe that?

17:14.323 --> 17:18.323
What else could it be? It's not
me doing these things, I swear it.

17:18.323 --> 17:21.403
It's not the devil, Charlotte.
Then what is it?

17:22.963 --> 17:24.843
Am I crazy? I don't think you are.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.103
Then how do you
explain the things I do?

17:27.103 --> 17:28.903
What things?

17:32.023 --> 17:35.763
Once I woke up stark naked in a
strange man's bed. I
don't remember how I got there.

17:35.763 --> 17:40.343
I ran out of the house but he chased
after me, so I started screaming.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.383
The police came and took me home.

17:42.383 --> 17:47.703
Father was very angry. He locked
me in the cellar for two days.

17:47.703 --> 17:49.343
I also do other things.

17:49.343 --> 17:51.943
Terrible things.

17:51.943 --> 17:54.423
I don't remember doing them
but everybody else does.

17:56.223 --> 17:59.143
What's wrong with me?

17:59.143 --> 18:02.663
You have a very rare condition
called a dual personality.

18:02.663 --> 18:06.443
Your mind is divided into
two distinct entities.

18:06.443 --> 18:10.403
Someone very different from you
emerges when you become upset.

18:10.403 --> 18:12.763
She views herself as your protector.

18:12.763 --> 18:14.943
My protector?

18:14.943 --> 18:17.843
She wouldn't do these
things if she were my protector.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.963
Charlotte, you don't seem
entirely shocked at this revelation.

18:22.963 --> 18:26.103
Have you sensed
the presence of someone else?

18:27.703 --> 18:29.243
I always thought it was the devil.

18:30.663 --> 18:33.163
I suppose I should
be grateful it's not.

18:35.863 --> 18:37.483
She calls herself Maddie?

18:39.863 --> 18:41.483
Strange men have called me that.

18:43.143 --> 18:46.163
Not the kind of men decent girls
should make company with.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.803
Did she do it then?

18:50.803 --> 18:52.523
Did she kill my father?

18:54.583 --> 18:56.263
We have no idea.

18:58.503 --> 19:04.543
She exhibits the symptoms but
obviously my diagnosis is incomplete
until I speak with Maddie.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.483
The question is
how to bring her out?

19:06.483 --> 19:10.223
She seems to only emerge
when Charlotte is threatened.

19:10.223 --> 19:13.183
The last thing we need to do is
cause more trauma to her psyche.

19:13.183 --> 19:16.843
Perhaps we could use hypnosis.

19:16.843 --> 19:21.443
There's no guarantee it will work.
We're in uncharted territory here.

19:24.603 --> 19:26.743
You're floating.

19:26.743 --> 19:29.223
Free from every constraint.

19:29.223 --> 19:34.103
Released from
the bounds of time and flesh.

19:34.103 --> 19:35.823
You have no body.

19:35.823 --> 19:38.963
Can you feel the chair beneath you?
No.

19:42.463 --> 19:46.323
Charlotte, this is Detective Murdoch.

19:46.323 --> 19:48.243
I'd like to speak to Maddie, please.

19:48.243 --> 19:53.203
Maddie's not here. Where is she?

19:53.203 --> 19:55.163
I don't know.

19:56.523 --> 19:57.823
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:59.523 --> 20:01.003
You should see this.

20:09.497 --> 20:12.657
We found it in the cellar.
Higgins dug it out of a coal bin.

20:12.657 --> 20:16.957
Where's Mrs Taylor now? I've brought
her in. She's in your office.

20:16.957 --> 20:18.437
Thank you, George.

20:24.337 --> 20:26.917
I took it off after
I finished baking the cake.

20:26.917 --> 20:32.497
I dropped it in the hamper in the
bedroom. Charlotte must have put it
on before she killed Alexander.

20:32.497 --> 20:36.177
So she went down to the cellar,
hid it in a coal box,

20:36.177 --> 20:39.217
returned to the scene of the crime
and retrieved the axe

20:39.217 --> 20:43.197
then went to her bedroom and waited
for the police to arrive?
That doesn't make sense.

20:43.197 --> 20:46.277
Nothing that girl does makes sense.

20:46.277 --> 20:48.097
She must have been
trying to frame me.

20:56.357 --> 20:58.397
Was the mother being set up then?

20:58.397 --> 21:02.717
Possibly.
I suppose anybody could have stuffed
the apron in the coal bin.

21:02.717 --> 21:04.897
The question is, why?

21:04.897 --> 21:10.297
Sir, I have never seen
a woman express such disdain
for her own daughter.

21:10.297 --> 21:13.117
Hard to love a child
like that I suppose.

21:13.117 --> 21:16.537
Yes. Is she unloved
because she's disturbed

21:16.537 --> 21:20.037
or is she disturbed because
she is so unloved?

21:26.537 --> 21:29.977
Any luck? I just can't
seem to bring Maddie out.

21:29.977 --> 21:32.277
I was afraid of this.

21:32.277 --> 21:36.017
We could use drugs.
I've been experimenting
with fungal hallucinogens.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.417
I guess we'll have to
do this the hard way.

21:40.417 --> 21:41.917
Will she remember this session?

21:41.917 --> 21:44.097
No.

21:44.097 --> 21:45.697
Bring her out, please.

21:45.697 --> 21:47.477
Wake up, Charlotte.

21:50.417 --> 21:54.977
Charlotte...
You've been under hypnosis.

21:54.977 --> 21:57.917
Do you know what we've learned? What?

21:57.917 --> 22:00.997
You've been lying to us. No.

22:00.997 --> 22:03.357
Yes, you murdered your father.

22:03.357 --> 22:05.457
No, it wasn't me.

22:05.457 --> 22:09.637
It was Maddie. There is no Maddie.
There's only you, Charlotte.

22:09.637 --> 22:14.097
You butchered your own
father in cold blood
and now you're going to pay for it.

22:14.097 --> 22:17.117
You are going to hang by the neck
until you are dead!

22:17.117 --> 22:20.157
Stop it! Stop it!

22:20.157 --> 22:22.277
You can't win, Maddie.

22:22.277 --> 22:23.817
You have to co-operate.

22:29.137 --> 22:31.417
Are you going to introduce
me to your friend?

22:35.137 --> 22:36.957
Maddie, this is Dr Roberts.

22:38.537 --> 22:41.477
Not a regular doctor, are you?

22:41.477 --> 22:43.837
No, I'm not.

22:43.837 --> 22:45.957
That's a shame.

22:45.957 --> 22:47.517
Maddie?

22:47.517 --> 22:49.177
What?

22:49.177 --> 22:52.837
I want to know about the night
your father died. I don't know!

22:54.717 --> 22:57.937
My first memory was when you
took the axe from my hand.

22:57.937 --> 23:00.957
You're lying to us.
You told us you protect Charlotte.

23:00.957 --> 23:04.117
I do. Then why do you not
remember what she remembers?

23:04.117 --> 23:05.857
I don't know.

23:05.857 --> 23:07.517
It's like a dream.

23:07.517 --> 23:09.817
The memory fades.

23:09.817 --> 23:13.277
So if you don't remember and
Charlotte claims not to remember...

23:13.277 --> 23:16.397
Then Charlotte's lying.

23:19.837 --> 23:21.537
I didn't think she had it in her.

23:25.397 --> 23:28.417
They can't both have suffered
blackouts at the same time.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.777
One of them must be lying.

23:29.777 --> 23:34.097
Unless Charlotte suffered from
hysterical amnesia,
as you first suspected.

23:34.097 --> 23:36.437
We'll have to put Charlotte
under hypnosis again.

23:38.397 --> 23:39.377
Excuse me.

23:42.117 --> 23:43.817
Good day, Doctor.

23:43.817 --> 23:45.457
Anything to report?

23:45.457 --> 23:48.577
Yes, Alexander Taylor had
cirrhosis of the liver.

23:48.577 --> 23:50.497
That's not surprising.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.877
Anything else? No, that was it.

23:57.117 --> 23:59.457
You've heard about our
suspect, haven't you?

24:01.437 --> 24:03.977
A dual personality.
It's so fascinating!

24:03.977 --> 24:07.817
And naturally, as a doctor, you have
a clinical interest in the condition.

24:07.817 --> 24:11.157
Of course. But it's so rare.

24:13.497 --> 24:16.097
Would you like to observe
the interview. Why, yes!

24:16.097 --> 24:17.637
If that's all right.

24:23.497 --> 24:24.497
She's well under.

24:26.397 --> 24:29.597
Can you take her back
to the night of her father's murder?

24:29.597 --> 24:34.857
Charlotte, it's the night of your
father's murder. Where are you?

24:34.857 --> 24:37.237
I'm in my bedroom.

24:43.557 --> 24:45.397
Charlotte, what do you see?

24:46.697 --> 24:48.257
What do you hear?

24:48.257 --> 24:50.717
I hear someone coming up the stairs.

24:54.397 --> 24:57.897
Who is it, Charlotte? I don't know.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.297
You have to think hard.

25:00.297 --> 25:02.117
Part of you knows.

25:02.117 --> 25:04.897
Someone is coming up the stairs.

25:04.897 --> 25:08.037
What happens next?

25:13.737 --> 25:14.717
Mommy?

25:24.317 --> 25:25.917
Mommy?

25:31.317 --> 25:32.497
Charlotte...

25:36.157 --> 25:38.017
I'm Girly.

25:39.557 --> 25:43.137
Girly? How old are you?

25:45.157 --> 25:46.697
I'm three.

25:58.837 --> 26:00.737
Girly, I need you to sit down now.

26:02.297 --> 26:05.237
Girly, please sit down, I need
you to answer some questions.

26:09.277 --> 26:11.237
I want Maddie.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.957
Maddie?

26:12.957 --> 26:15.037
My dolly.

26:18.137 --> 26:21.017
Maddie is the name of your dolly?
She's in the cellar.

26:21.017 --> 26:24.457
Can you get her for me cos
she's scared of the cellar.

26:27.957 --> 26:31.297
I'll fetch Maddie for you
if you answer some questions for me.

26:37.917 --> 26:42.677
Is this about Daddy? Yes, Girly.

26:44.317 --> 26:46.437
What happened to your Daddy?

26:47.977 --> 26:53.377
He's dead. Somebody killed him.

26:53.377 --> 26:59.137
Who killed him, Girly? It's a secret.

26:59.137 --> 27:00.957
This is very serious, Girly.

27:00.957 --> 27:03.617
I'm a police officer,
I need you to tell me.

27:03.617 --> 27:07.017
I said it's a secret!

27:07.017 --> 27:08.597
Girly?

27:08.597 --> 27:10.037
Girly?

27:11.597 --> 27:13.957
They used to call me that.

27:19.677 --> 27:22.417
Three personalities,
has that ever happened before?

27:22.417 --> 27:24.777
There have been cases
of as many as four.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.077
Why did she think I was her mother?

27:27.077 --> 27:29.257
Perhaps there's a resemblance.

27:29.257 --> 27:31.857
I don't see it.
For one, her mother is much older.

27:31.857 --> 27:35.037
But Girly seems to be a personality
frozen at the age of three.

27:35.037 --> 27:40.797
Perhaps Dr Ogden reminds her
of her mother at a younger age.

27:40.797 --> 27:44.697
At any rate, Dr Ogden seemed to serve
as a trigger for bringing Girly out.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.317
We may need your help
next time we speak with her.

27:47.317 --> 27:51.517
Of course. You know where I am.

27:51.517 --> 27:56.657
Well, you two appear to be
having fun with your new toy.

27:56.657 --> 27:59.337
Have you made any
progress on the case? Yes. What?

27:59.337 --> 28:02.297
Girly seems to know
who committed the murder.

28:02.297 --> 28:07.337
Either she witnessed someone
doing it or she knows which of
the other personalities did.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.337
Why are you hanging
around here, then?

28:09.337 --> 28:13.457
Charlotte re-emerged before Girly
could tell us who the killer was.

28:13.457 --> 28:16.457
Well, that's bloody
convenient, isn't it?

28:16.457 --> 28:20.637
Can't you see? She's having you on.
Sir, how would she know
how to have us on.

28:20.637 --> 28:23.897
Very few people have even
heard of split personalities.

28:23.897 --> 28:26.117
Her behaviour is in
accordance with such cases.

28:26.117 --> 28:31.357
Look, I don't care if this is coming
from Maddie, Charlotte or the
latest incarnation of Genghis Khan.

28:31.357 --> 28:33.397
Just get the truth out of her!

28:35.177 --> 28:37.377
Girly? Could you look at me, please?

28:41.137 --> 28:43.797
Girly, the detective needs to
ask you some questions.

28:47.337 --> 28:48.577
All right.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.577
Girly, when we last spoke,

28:50.577 --> 28:54.377
you told me
you knew who killed your father.

28:55.717 --> 28:57.057
Is that right?

28:59.877 --> 29:01.437
How do you know?

29:02.597 --> 29:04.157
He walked by my room.

29:04.157 --> 29:05.717
Him?

29:06.977 --> 29:11.457
He was carrying an axe. Who was it?

29:13.477 --> 29:15.837
I can't tell. It's a secret.

29:17.717 --> 29:20.957
Girly, it's not
good to keep secrets about this.

29:20.957 --> 29:22.717
I promised.

29:24.937 --> 29:28.097
Who did you promise? Boo Boo.

29:28.097 --> 29:30.357
Who's Boo Boo?

29:32.777 --> 29:33.957
You know!

29:36.197 --> 29:38.077
Of course I know.

29:39.537 --> 29:42.217
We're just playing a game.
You like games, don't you?

29:46.497 --> 29:48.937
Let's play a whisper game.

29:48.937 --> 29:51.097
I want you

29:51.097 --> 29:53.977
to whisper in the detective's ear
who Boo Boo is.

30:05.317 --> 30:06.997
(He's my brother.)

30:10.457 --> 30:12.817
I don't care
what she said. I am not Boo Boo.

30:12.817 --> 30:16.697
For God's sakes, Boo Boo doesn't
even exist! How do you mean?

30:16.697 --> 30:20.877
He's her imaginary friend. She used
to talk to him when she was upset.

30:22.237 --> 30:26.237
Used to? She grew up and forgot
about him for the most part.

30:26.237 --> 30:28.257
But not completely?

30:30.597 --> 30:32.657
When Charlotte misbehaved,

30:32.657 --> 30:37.597
Father would drag her to the cellar
and lock her down there.

30:37.597 --> 30:39.657
Why not simply lock her in her room?

30:39.657 --> 30:42.617
Because she was
terrified of the cellar.

30:42.617 --> 30:48.297
I don't know why, but she would
scream down there for hours.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.737
Eventually when Father was asleep,

30:52.737 --> 30:54.357
I'd unlock the door.

30:54.357 --> 30:57.397
Charlotte would be curled up
at the top of the stairs

30:57.397 --> 31:00.777
with her thumb in her mouth,
murmuring, "Boo Boo" over and over.

31:04.957 --> 31:08.377
An imaginary friend?
An imaginary friend.

31:08.377 --> 31:12.757
So how does an imaginary friend bury
a real axe in a real man's chest?

31:12.757 --> 31:15.537
Perhaps Boo Boo is
a fourth personality.

31:15.537 --> 31:19.577
A brother figure who
protects Charlotte from
the ravages of her father.

31:19.577 --> 31:23.637
Charlotte seemed to witness Boo Boo
as an independent entity.

31:23.637 --> 31:29.737
I have patients who, when
experiencing abuse, have the ability
to disassociate from themselves.

31:29.737 --> 31:33.937
As if they're witnessing the
abuse happening to someone else?
Exactly. Hold it.

31:33.937 --> 31:38.877
You're telling me that this
imaginary friend that she saw walk
by her room, with an axe,

31:38.877 --> 31:40.337
was Charlotte herself?

31:40.337 --> 31:44.297
Well, not Charlotte but...
Yes, yes, yes,
another bloody personality.

31:44.297 --> 31:47.717
Is that what you're saying? Yes.

31:47.717 --> 31:51.297
Unless Boo Boo actually existed.

31:51.297 --> 31:53.437
George.

31:53.437 --> 31:55.357
Sir.

31:55.357 --> 31:58.937
I want you to dig up everything
you can on the Taylor family.

31:58.937 --> 32:03.037
See if Charlotte
ever had an older brother. Sir.

32:03.037 --> 32:06.017
How should we proceed? Murdoch?

32:07.957 --> 32:11.957
If Charlotte's multiple personalities
seem to be the result of trauma,

32:11.957 --> 32:14.717
perhaps we should find
out what that trauma was.

32:14.717 --> 32:17.897
Girly is three years old, perhaps
the trauma occurred there.

32:17.897 --> 32:20.057
Let's take her back to that age.

32:21.117 --> 32:24.837
Charlotte,
we're taking you back in time.

32:24.837 --> 32:26.817
Far, far back.

32:26.817 --> 32:28.577
You're small.

32:28.577 --> 32:30.077
Very small.

32:31.197 --> 32:32.917
We need a specific time reference.

32:37.077 --> 32:40.037
You've just lost Maddie.
Do you remember Maddie?

32:41.637 --> 32:43.397
She's my doll.

32:43.397 --> 32:44.897
That's right.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.857
Where is she? In the cellar.

32:49.897 --> 32:51.517
Why don't you go and get her?

32:51.517 --> 32:54.537
I don't want to.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.597
You don't like the cellar, do you?

32:56.597 --> 32:59.557
Bad things happen in the cellar.

33:01.397 --> 33:02.677
What kind of things?

33:07.717 --> 33:13.717
Charlotte, you need to go
down to the cellar. Your favourite
doll, Maddie, is down there.

33:13.717 --> 33:16.117
She needs you to come get her.

33:16.117 --> 33:17.737
No.

33:17.737 --> 33:20.137
I'm scared. Why, Charlotte?

33:20.137 --> 33:22.917
Why are you scared
to go down to the cellar?

33:22.917 --> 33:24.637
Daddy's down there.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.557
What's Daddy doing?

33:27.557 --> 33:29.317
He's got an axe.

33:31.137 --> 33:32.837
What's he doing with the axe?

33:34.397 --> 33:35.677
Charlotte?

33:35.677 --> 33:38.997
What's Daddy doing with the axe? No!

33:40.917 --> 33:42.997
Daddy, stop!

33:42.997 --> 33:45.917
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Bring her out.
Bring her out of this now!

33:50.197 --> 33:54.197
What happened? We need to find
out what happened in that cellar.

33:57.779 --> 33:59.919
This is where we found
the bloodied apron.

34:02.739 --> 34:05.659
Anything in particular
you're looking for, sir?

34:05.659 --> 34:07.359
I don't know, Henry.

34:07.359 --> 34:10.299
Something happened
down here 17 years ago.

34:10.299 --> 34:13.179
Something terrible, I suspect.

34:13.179 --> 34:16.739
Well, it all seems on the up and
up now, sir. Cement floor and all.

34:18.458 --> 34:22.119
You don't often see them in
houses this old do you, sir?

34:22.119 --> 34:23.079
No, no, you don't.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.938
In fact, I'll wager this was poured
after the house was built.

34:30.399 --> 34:35.379
Henry, I want a couple of men
with sledge hammers and shovels to
excavate the ground under this floor.

34:35.379 --> 34:37.539
Tell them to be very
careful when they dig.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.699
Sir, I've done some
investigating at city records.

34:42.699 --> 34:47.259
What did you find out, George?
It seems the Taylor house used
to belong to a Gerald Edwards.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.039
He died in 1875 leaving
the house to his widow, Bernice.

34:50.039 --> 34:51.938
Bernice? As in Bernice Taylor?

34:51.938 --> 34:56.819
The very same. A year after
her husband's death, Bernice
remarries to Mr Alexander Taylor.

34:56.819 --> 34:59.099
So Joshua and Charlotte
are Alexander's children.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.939
Correct. But she had a ten-year-old
son from her first marriage.

35:03.839 --> 35:08.219
What was his name? Robert Edwards.

35:08.219 --> 35:11.679
Robert... Bobby... Boo Boo.

35:11.679 --> 35:13.819
Get Mrs Taylor back in here, George.

35:13.819 --> 35:15.399
Sir.

35:17.679 --> 35:20.599
Robert ran away from
home when he was 13. Why?

35:20.599 --> 35:23.859
He was always a troublesome lad.
He butted heads

35:23.859 --> 35:25.459
with his step-father.

35:25.459 --> 35:29.919
You know how they get at that age.
And you never saw him again? No.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.739
He never wrote. He never came back.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.939
That must have broken your heart.

35:34.939 --> 35:37.759
Children do that to you, you know?

35:39.359 --> 35:40.979
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

35:44.479 --> 35:46.459
Just received word from Higgins.

35:46.459 --> 35:48.539
They've found something
in the cellar.

35:53.559 --> 35:57.139
I can't tell much about the
victim until I lay the skeleton out.

35:57.139 --> 36:00.679
But I can say the bones have
been shattered and severed.

36:00.679 --> 36:04.099
With an axe? Seems likely.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.879
What is that? I believe it's Maddie.

36:15.879 --> 36:18.879
So was it Robert Edwards, the
older brother, that we dug up?

36:18.879 --> 36:23.739
I think so. I suspect that
while she was retrieving her
doll from the cellar,

36:23.739 --> 36:27.619
Charlotte accidentally witnessed
her father chopping up
her brother's body.

36:27.619 --> 36:33.359
Bloody hell. His mother attests
that Robert had a difficult
relationship with his step-father.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.199
A 13-year-old naturally butts heads
with his own father.

36:36.199 --> 36:39.419
How much worse would it be
to live with an abusive,
drunken step-father?

36:40.539 --> 36:44.079
Yes, but drunken and abusive
enough to kill his wife's son?

36:44.079 --> 36:46.879
Do you think the mother knew?
I don't think so.

36:46.879 --> 36:51.119
But I can't help but wonder
why she cared so little about
her son's disappearance.

36:51.119 --> 36:54.999
Sir. Dr Ogden wants to
see you in the morgue.

36:54.999 --> 36:59.699
The body was chopped into 11 pieces
but that wasn't the cause of death.

37:00.699 --> 37:02.519
Look at the hyoid bone.

37:02.519 --> 37:05.819
It's fractured.
The victim was strangled.

37:05.819 --> 37:10.259
So he was murdered in the cellar and
then dismembered for easier burial.

37:10.259 --> 37:13.159
This isn't the body of Robert
Edwards, William.

37:13.159 --> 37:16.679
Judging by the size of the pelvic
bone, it's obvious the
victim was a woman.

37:17.699 --> 37:21.019
A woman? Likely in her early 30s.

37:22.199 --> 37:27.079
That's why Bernice was so hostile
and indifferent toward her children.

37:27.079 --> 37:31.099
It wasn't her brother Charlotte
saw chopped into pieces.
It was her mother.

37:31.099 --> 37:34.579
But her mother's alive.

37:34.579 --> 37:38.739
No, if I'm not mistaken...
this is her mother.

37:40.959 --> 37:45.719
Alexander told me that his wife
had run off with some Englishman
and left him with the children.

37:46.779 --> 37:48.899
You never suspected he'd killed her.

37:48.899 --> 37:54.759
No, of course not. I met
him at church. He seemed
lonely. I felt sorry for him.

37:54.759 --> 37:58.079
So sorry you decided
to impersonate his wife?

37:58.079 --> 38:01.239
That was Alexander's idea.

38:01.239 --> 38:04.419
He wanted to sell off the
back 40 and his wife held title.

38:04.419 --> 38:07.559
So you took her name?

38:07.559 --> 38:09.659
I was taking his anyway.

38:09.659 --> 38:12.099
What about the children?

38:12.099 --> 38:16.639
They were too young to remember
their true mother and Robert had
run off before I arrived.

38:16.639 --> 38:21.799
I tried, I really tried to be
a good mother to them, but Charlotte
was such a handful,

38:21.799 --> 38:25.339
flying off into these
terrible rages at the drop of a hat.

38:25.339 --> 38:27.699
She was like that
before I ever met her.

38:27.699 --> 38:29.939
Some children are just
born difficult.

38:31.779 --> 38:38.679
Actually, Mrs Taylor,
Charlotte witnessed her mother
being dismembered with an axe.

38:38.679 --> 38:41.799
That is why she's filled
with such rage.

38:41.799 --> 38:43.999
That's what drove her to madness.

38:43.999 --> 38:47.939
Oh, my God. I didn't know.

38:50.839 --> 38:55.879
Gerald Edwards dies leaving a widow,
Bernice and son, Robert.

38:55.879 --> 39:02.579
Alexander Taylor marries the widow
and she has two more children
with him. Joshua and Charlotte.

39:02.579 --> 39:06.779
Three years later, Alexander Taylor
murders the widow

39:06.779 --> 39:10.419
and invites a second woman
into the home to take her place.

39:10.419 --> 39:12.999
So this woman takes
the original mother's name.

39:12.999 --> 39:15.199
And pretends to be
the mother to his two children.

39:16.219 --> 39:18.959
What happens to him, Robert Edwards?

39:18.959 --> 39:21.979
I believe he left home
as Bernice number two claims.

39:21.979 --> 39:25.339
And decides to come back 17 years
later to take bloody revenge?

39:25.339 --> 39:29.659
Girly claims that Boo Boo
walked past her doorway with an axe.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.599
You're thinking that was Robert?

39:31.599 --> 39:35.699
Perhaps seeing her brother acted
as a trigger for bringing Girly out.

39:36.739 --> 39:41.119
How did he slip into the house
unseen? How did he know Taylor would
be sleeping one off in his room?

39:41.119 --> 39:44.399
He knew his habits. How?

39:44.399 --> 39:48.979
Perhaps he had a spy, or he had
spent time with the family, himself.

39:48.979 --> 39:50.719
They would have recognised him.

39:50.719 --> 39:52.819
Bernice number two never knew Robert.

39:52.819 --> 39:58.319
Alexander Taylor would only have
remembered him as a 13-year-old boy.

39:58.319 --> 40:01.239
Only Girly
recognised him for who he truly was.

40:02.899 --> 40:05.359
Off her bloody nut, she is.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.219
Spends her days on the swing,
watching us work.

40:08.219 --> 40:10.839
Sucking her
thumb like a little girl.

40:10.839 --> 40:14.719
She was Girly while she was
sitting on that swing. What?

40:14.719 --> 40:21.439
Sir, if Boo Boo acted as a trigger
for bringing Girly out, perhaps
one of the farm hands is Boo Boo.

40:21.439 --> 40:23.059
Which one?

40:24.059 --> 40:26.559
Robert Edwards would be 30 now.

40:27.519 --> 40:29.539
The younger one.

40:29.539 --> 40:31.139
You've got the wrong man.

40:31.139 --> 40:34.259
My name is Clive Brewster.

40:34.259 --> 40:37.439
I was born in Victoria BC, in 1867.

40:38.259 --> 40:39.939
Do you have a birth certificate?

40:39.939 --> 40:41.859
Am I required to carry one?

40:42.939 --> 40:47.059
No, but it would certainly help to
prove you are who you say you are.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.679
Telegraph the British Columbia
Department of Records.

40:49.679 --> 40:53.179
I have no doubt
a Clive Brewster is on record.

40:53.179 --> 40:55.979
My problem is determining
whether you are him.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.159
Well, that's not my problem, is it?

41:01.719 --> 41:04.459
Perhaps your parents can
vouch for your identity?

41:04.459 --> 41:07.079
They're both dead. Siblings?

41:07.079 --> 41:09.399
I was an only child.

41:09.399 --> 41:15.699
Can you name a single person who can
vouch for your identity, Mr Brewster?

41:17.479 --> 41:22.159
No. You're certainly
not helping yourself here.

41:22.159 --> 41:25.379
No, detective,
I'm simply not helping you.

41:26.899 --> 41:28.699
You think I'm Robert Edwards.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.319
Prove it.

41:43.299 --> 41:44.419
Boo Boo!

41:52.839 --> 41:55.359
I didn't tell anyone
about our secret.

41:57.179 --> 41:59.999
They asked but I wouldn't tell.

41:59.999 --> 42:02.819
It's OK, Girly.

42:02.819 --> 42:04.299
It's OK.

42:13.359 --> 42:17.359
My step-father was a mean drunk.
He used to beat my mother.

42:17.359 --> 42:20.959
He used to beat me too. I never
understood why she was with him.

42:20.959 --> 42:23.299
Then one day I came
home and she was gone.

42:23.299 --> 42:25.759
He said she ran off to England.

42:25.759 --> 42:28.119
And you believed him?

42:28.119 --> 42:30.239
I thought I was
the cause of her leaving.

42:30.239 --> 42:32.039
I was a difficult boy.

42:32.039 --> 42:34.419
Anyway, I lit out on my own.

42:36.579 --> 42:39.919
There was Charlotte... Girly. I know.

42:39.919 --> 42:43.699
I was young and selfish.
I could only feel my own hurt.

42:45.539 --> 42:46.679
What made you come back?

42:48.839 --> 42:50.959
I don't know.

42:50.959 --> 42:54.199
Maybe I hoped I'd find
my mother had returned.

42:55.799 --> 43:01.159
Instead I found this strange woman
calling herself by my mom's name.

43:01.159 --> 43:03.579
I knew then something was wrong.

43:03.579 --> 43:06.779
Why not simply go to the police?

43:06.779 --> 43:08.259
And tell them what?

43:09.839 --> 43:13.859
I didn't know she was
buried in the floor.

43:24.919 --> 43:30.399
I know what you're thinking but I
never would have let Charlotte
hang for this. I swear it.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.399
I was hoping to pin
it on that woman.

43:33.659 --> 43:37.239
That's why you put the bloodied
apron in the coal bin in the cellar.

43:37.239 --> 43:40.219
Charlotte would never go in
the cellar. Everyone knew that.

43:43.439 --> 43:47.639
Thank you, Mr Edwards. I'll draft
up a confession for you to sign.

43:47.639 --> 43:50.099
I want you to give this
to Charlotte.

43:51.959 --> 43:56.019
This is the only photograph
ever taken of our mother.

44:05.479 --> 44:08.099
Mommy.

44:08.099 --> 44:09.699
Will she ever recover?

44:09.699 --> 44:11.299
Hard to know.

44:11.299 --> 44:16.319
She's agreed to stay in my
care for a few months,
but I fear it may take longer.

44:18.139 --> 44:20.479
Come now, Charlotte, time to go.

44:23.099 --> 44:26.899
Hell of a thing, witnessing your
father chop your mother to pieces.

44:26.899 --> 44:30.159
Be enough to make anyone
sprout a new personality or two.

44:30.159 --> 44:32.799
Well, at least you have
your confession, sir.

44:32.799 --> 44:34.639
What will become of Robert Edwards?

44:34.639 --> 44:37.379
The noose? Not if I have
anything to do with it.
