- Yeah, I was busy... with my boyfriend.

Come work for my magazine. You'll
have your own assistant within a year.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.116

- To speak to Daniel Meade.

- OK, but it's an emergency!

- Really?

Have I told you how impossible
the last two weeks away from you were?

01:42.769 --> 01:45.203
Mmm. It was unbearable for me too.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.196
Why is my yogurt crunchy?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.936
That's the pine nut layer.
You got to keep going.

01:51.010 --> 01:54.673
So promise me you'll never spend
that much time away from me again.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.738
Are you asking me to stick around?

- Chapter one from your book.

going on an exotic vacation...

02:20.940 --> 02:24.171
I wrote that chapter in the book
just to give it some pizzazz.

02:24.244 --> 02:28.271
They're turning it into a movie next
year. Penelope Cruz is dying to play me.

02:28.348 --> 02:32.114
So the part about wearing
each other's underwear for a day?

02:32.185 --> 02:34.619
- No. I was drunk when I wrote that.
- Thank God.

- No, I don't like it.

Well, honestly,
I don't know how you did it.

as you calling them "Jimmy Poo's."

I have to get back to reality.

Why don't you hold onto a little bit
of that calm you had in Texas with me?

04:49.656 --> 04:54.525
You know, be a little more armadillo,
a little less roadrunner.

04:54.594 --> 04:57.757
Uh... A little more English,
a little less Texan, please.

04:57.830 --> 05:01.231
The armadillo doesn't move fast,
but gets done what he needs to,

<i>Yeah. I think there's ticket stubs to

- None of your business.

- Listen, lady...
- My name is Constance, not "lady."

Let me remind you,

between you and deportation.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.610

- We need a socialite in the military.

- Oh, Betty.

- Sofia, what's wrong?
- I think I'm losing Daniel.

- Have I made myself clear?
- Very.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.450
Good. Then I'll see you tomorrow.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.158
An article? Ooh.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.829
Make me sound
extra glamorous. And skinny.

13:26.572 --> 13:29.735
Honest quote, what did you
think of me when I first arrived?

13:29.809 --> 13:33.176
- Well, I hated you, of course.
- "Hated me."

13:33.245 --> 13:35.736
Because I didn't
look like everybody else?

13:35.815 --> 13:39.216
No. It's because I'd been
angling for this position for months,

13:39.285 --> 13:43.517
and you traipse in here with your bushy
eyebrows and really bad bangs, I'm like,

13:43.589 --> 13:45.819
"That took my job?"

13:45.891 --> 13:48.359
You confirmed everything
I'm writing about.

13:48.427 --> 13:52.659
Well, I must confess, at a certain point
I did become envious of you.

13:52.731 --> 13:56.326
- Wait. You became envious of me?
- Only in the most bizarre way.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.836
I can't go out
with an out-of-season handbag,

13:58.904 --> 14:01.998
and you show up on a daily basis
looking like a yard sale.

14:02.074 --> 14:06.033
Didn't care, like you were genetically
engineered without the fear gene.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.944
- I got to give you props.
- Thank you, Amanda.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.279
Oh, and FYI, none of this
means I like you or anything.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.978
Of course.

14:20.659 --> 14:24.117
Where were you this morning?
I called you, like, 1,000 times.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.187
[Chuckling] With Ted.

14:26.265 --> 14:30.031
He's staying with me
through the weekend. What did I miss?

14:30.102 --> 14:34.004
A guy named Steve called. Said he had
valuable information about Bradford.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.167
- Cryptic. Shall I try him?
- No. What else?

14:37.243 --> 14:39.973
A 1:00 editors' meeting
about the bridal issue.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.344
- Daniel can handle that.
- But it's Vera Wang this year.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.110
You love your Wang.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.175
[Screams]

14:47.253 --> 14:49.050
What is it?

14:49.121 --> 14:52.056
I don't know. It's like a giant
dead rat or something.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.525
- Did you piss off Donna Karan again?
- I think...

14:55.594 --> 14:59.553
It's an armadillo. Aw.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.192
Would you put him
up there for me, please?

15:05.504 --> 15:07.699
[Cell phone ringing]

15:10.075 --> 15:12.873
<i>- Yes?
- [woman] We need to speak...</i>

15:13.646 --> 15:15.807
...in person.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.953
You weren't the type of girl
I was used to working with.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.457
But as I got to know you,
I really grew to like you.

15:25.524 --> 15:29.051
And I got to say...
you helped me grow as a person.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.596
- You're writing all this down?
- Of course.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.465
So, I really helped you
grow as a person?

15:34.533 --> 15:38.526
Well, yeah. Well, the whole Sofia thing.
You had a huge part in that.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.539
So you're still planning
on proposing to her?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.734
Why do you ask?

15:43.809 --> 15:47.006
You didn't hear this from me.
If you tell her, I will deny it.

15:47.079 --> 15:50.913
She was crying this morning. She thinks
you're having second thoughts.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.315
- What? That's crazy!
- Can you blame her?

15:53.385 --> 15:56.877
She doesn't want to become another one
of your "Daniel Meade girls."

15:56.956 --> 15:58.287
Listen,

15:58.357 --> 16:02.191
I think if you don't want to lose her,
you know what you have to do.

16:02.261 --> 16:05.924
- Thanks, Betty.
- I'm getting lunch, get you something?

16:05.998 --> 16:09.297
- I have a new assistant now, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.902
Now tell me, where does one find

16:12.972 --> 16:15.031
an armadillo in Manhattan?

16:15.607 --> 16:18.599
In Chinatown. I think it was
going to be someone's lunch.

16:19.445 --> 16:23.176
Well, despite the fact that it
clashes with most of my office...

16:23.882 --> 16:25.144
...I adore him.

16:25.217 --> 16:28.846
I put him on the shelf in front of me,
to remind me of what's important.

16:28.921 --> 16:32.789
- What's that?
- Well, moments like this.

16:32.858 --> 16:37.522
I spent the past 20 years worrying about
hemlines and heels, and for what?

16:37.596 --> 16:40.759
If you have no one to share it with,
what's the point?

16:41.633 --> 16:45.000
You're about to share hemlines
and heels with me, are you?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.907
I was thinking about
sharing something else.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.441
- What?
- I got to warn you, Willie.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.616
I'm hauling around
a truck full of baggage.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.881
I have three exes, I'm working
on a fourth. A passel of kids.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.752
We both have plenty of baggage.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.483
But...

17:06.558 --> 17:09.459
...l'm willing to give it a shot
if you are.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.341
[Man] Hey, lady. Get out of here.

18:04.183 --> 18:08.176
<i>Hunter is supposedly this perfect
modellracecar driverlhumanitarian</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:10.221
living in Europe, except he's here.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.587
- So he gets around.
- I saw Sofia with him.

18:12.658 --> 18:16.355
- She told me they don't speak.
- Well, they reconnected.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.419
She was handing him a wad of cash.

18:18.497 --> 18:21.227
A lot of it. Right before
he walked into Boylesque.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.894
The strip club on 34th and 7th?

18:23.969 --> 18:28.099
What? I do manage to get out
of this closet every once in a while.

18:28.507 --> 18:32.807
I assume since it caters exclusively
to women that he works there.

18:32.878 --> 18:37.315
Sofia was dating a stripper.
Oh, my God. I love her.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.043
This is so weird.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.417
And she was so adamant about
getting Daniel to propose to her.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.719
- I don't know what to do.
- Oh, I do.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.555
- What?
- We investigate.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.693
Here I am birthing a calf.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.401
Oh, and Ted's lassoing me.

18:58.470 --> 19:03.271
I don't care about your silly
little vacation. What about the plan?

19:03.342 --> 19:08.211
[Sighs] The plan. The plan to take over
Meade Publication has clearly failed.

19:08.280 --> 19:13.115
Bradford knows now with complete
certainty that Fey Sommers is dead.

19:13.185 --> 19:16.416
And we have no firm evidence
linking him to her murder.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.720
Hand me my oxygen.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.924
[Inhaling deeply]

19:24.630 --> 19:27.064
Wilhelmina, I fully intend

19:27.132 --> 19:30.158
to take over the company
sooner rather than later.

19:30.802 --> 19:34.898
And if you're not my ally,
then you will be my enemy.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.602
And there will be no place
for you anywhere at Meade.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.339
Well...

19:41.413 --> 19:44.041
...we'll just let the chips
fall where they may.

19:48.387 --> 19:52.118
- Where are we?
- Somewhere I never bring a woman to.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.892
I didn't realize such a place
still existed in Manhattan.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.419
[Laughs] Yeah, I know I have
a few notches on my belt.

19:59.498 --> 20:02.365
Baby, it's all notch, no belt.

20:02.434 --> 20:06.598
Which makes me wonder, how does
a man with no belt keep his pants on?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.539
- Hmm?
- Mmm... Meeting someone like you.

20:14.746 --> 20:18.546
[Gasping] Mr. Meade.
This is so embarrassing.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.244
- What is he doing here?
- We're having dinner together.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.221
Before we move to that next step,

20:24.289 --> 20:27.622
I thought it was important for you
to meet both of my parents.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.787
- Welcome, Sofia.
- Hello. Thank you.

20:31.163 --> 20:35.497
My God, she's stunning. Thank God
Daniel got to her before you did.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.765
Hello, I'm Claire, Daniel's recovering
alcoholic mother. Welcome.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.602
Best behavior, I am trying
to make a good impression.

20:42.674 --> 20:45.837
Oh, my darling, I would never
do anything to embarrass you.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.401
Mmm-hmm.

20:47.479 --> 20:52.041
Let me show you Daniel's baby pictures.
He does the cutest thing in the tub.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.347
Does he?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.886
What are we looking for?

20:55.954 --> 20:59.788
Something that'll show that barracuda
the year I came into this country.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.350
I can't deal with this woman.
She's rude. She's obnoxious. She's...

21:03.428 --> 21:05.623
The U.S. Government.
What'd you expect?

21:05.697 --> 21:08.894
Respect. She shows up unannounced
and starts needling me.

21:08.967 --> 21:12.459
- I don't think she's ever smiled.
- Dad, stop. You're powerless.

21:12.537 --> 21:15.028
And, you know, we need her
on our side right now.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.871
Constance Grady is
only on Constance Grady's side.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.242
Well, then maybe Ignacio Suarez
should try being on her side.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.776
You ever stop to think that
maybe she's actually trying to help?

21:25.717 --> 21:27.548
Try getting in her good graces.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.747
You know, something simple,
something sweet.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.380
Make her smile.

You ladies ready to plunder the
Seven Seas for some buried treasure?

21:47.673 --> 21:50.267
- How much?
- We are not here for a lap dance.

21:50.342 --> 21:55.177
Sir, we're here to see
one of your performers... Hunter.

21:55.247 --> 21:59.377
Every other guy is named Hunter here.
You're gonna have to be a more specific.

21:59.451 --> 22:04.718
Well, he's tall, and blonde,
and he looks kind of Nordic.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.620
Oh. Of course. Hunter Nine.

22:09.695 --> 22:12.596
Well, get in line.
Everyone wants a piece of the Nine.

22:19.037 --> 22:22.768
Ooh... I think we're gonna need
an awful lot of singles.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.745
I open my closet door

22:27.813 --> 22:31.271
and there was Daniel,
in my Pucci strapless

22:31.350 --> 22:33.545
and a pair of patent leather pumps.

22:33.618 --> 22:37.952
For the record, I was six-years-old,
and it was my brother who dressed me up.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.389
You never talk about your brother.

22:40.459 --> 22:44.156
- Yeah. He died two years ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:44.229 --> 22:47.323
It's been a bit of a bumpy road
for the Meade family of late.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.624
But it seems our luck is changing.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.466
- To Sofia.
- To Sofia.

22:55.574 --> 22:58.839
[Speaks Spanish]

22:59.144 --> 23:02.671
As a Reyes you must have had
plenty of maids growing up.

23:02.748 --> 23:06.844
We spent a week at Javier Reyes' estate
in Puerto Vallarta.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.682
He has the most darling little zoo.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.485
<i>Or rather, zoologico?</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:14.855
You got the wrong Reyes.

23:14.926 --> 23:17.861
Growing up, we only had
one maid, my mother.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.420
And the closest I ever got
to the upper crust

23:20.499 --> 23:23.332
is when I used to help her
clean their houses.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.029
So no silver spoon?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.901
Oh, no. We could barely afford
a plastic one.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.770
That's why I like this girl.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.901
Someone who actually worked for
what they got out of life.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.912
You could learn something from her.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.210
And I fully intend to, Father,

23:38.583 --> 23:41.074
for as long as she's
willing to teach me.

23:46.725 --> 23:47.714
Hello?

23:47.793 --> 23:50.626
Betty, it's a bridge and tunnel
bachelorette party.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.630
- So?
- That woman is about to marry some fat,

23:53.698 --> 23:58.397
bald, pasty-looking dentist. This is
her last supper. She is cashing out.

23:58.470 --> 24:02.065
- Do you think he'll take my ATM card?
- I know where he can swipe it.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.904
OK. Fine. Here's lunch for the week.

24:05.076 --> 24:08.534
Twenty. Hunter! He's coming,
he's coming, he's coming.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.205
- Twenty.
- Hey ladies,

24:10.282 --> 24:12.842
you're ready to pay
the proper fine for the Nine.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.749
You can cop a feel,
just don't let management see you.

24:16.822 --> 24:19.052
- OK.
- He said.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.385
Hunter, do you have a girlfriend?

24:22.461 --> 24:26.488
I got girlfriends, boyfriends,
all sorts of friends.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.499
So... you mean you're bisexual?

24:30.569 --> 24:34.369
That's right, babe.
You buy, I'm sexual.

24:35.407 --> 24:39.138
So what kind of lap dance
you in the mood for? Cupping the cobra?

24:39.211 --> 24:43.443
Feeding the kitty? Slapping the bongos?
Or a good, old-fashioned hot dog race?

24:43.515 --> 24:46.348
Yes! Well, I'm assuming
everything's à la carte?

24:46.418 --> 24:51.117
Hey, Hunter.
Jiggle your junk on over here.

24:51.189 --> 24:54.920
[Chuckles] Time's up, ladies.
I gotta service the high rollers.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.621
- No. Please don't leave.
- I just gave you 20!

24:57.696 --> 25:01.029
Come to mama, baby. Oh, my God.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.897
He's a whore, what more
do we need to investigate?

25:03.969 --> 25:06.301
I have to find out about him and Sofia.

25:06.371 --> 25:09.238
Well, I suggest you make
a beeline for that ATM.

25:09.307 --> 25:13.641
Which is absolutely fine by me, because
I am here for the long haul, Betty.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.880
[Sofia] You two look so happy together.

25:17.949 --> 25:22.010
- How long have you been married?
- It'll be 38 years in September.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.851
They make it look so easy, don't they?

25:24.923 --> 25:27.892
I almost shot him one
Christmas in Ann Arbor.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.860
Thank God it was me
who was loaded and not the gun.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.260
You almost shot him?

25:32.330 --> 25:35.424
Well, every family does
holidays a little differently.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.333
In a marriage, things happen.

25:38.403 --> 25:41.167
Things like "Tisha" and "Cindy"

25:41.239 --> 25:43.469
and "Candee," with two "E's."

25:43.875 --> 25:46.366
And let's not forget about Fey.

25:46.444 --> 25:48.105
- Settle.
- Mmm.

25:48.179 --> 25:51.171
My point is that marriage
can be pretty awful sometimes.

25:51.249 --> 25:55.913
But, somehow, you find a way to go on.
And that's a good thing.

25:55.987 --> 25:59.423
Because when something
really bad happens,

25:59.491 --> 26:03.052
like losing one of your children...

26:03.995 --> 26:08.523
...you realize that you could never
survive it without your husband.

26:16.107 --> 26:18.701
Come on. Dance with me.

26:26.851 --> 26:29.149
You're bombed, aren't you?

26:29.220 --> 26:33.213
It's just a little cough syrup. [coughs]

26:36.127 --> 26:39.221
If you turn and run,
I will completely understand.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.695
Never.

26:43.735 --> 26:47.535

Why would you hire someone

I knew about
Daniel's reputation and, well,

30:32.230 --> 30:36.530
being just another single girl wouldn't
be enough to drive him to be with me.
