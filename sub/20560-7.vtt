-I didn't.

-We decided it was worth the risk.
-This is a mistake.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.057
This is how amateurs get caught.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.225
Nomi, help.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.145
Will, it's going to be fine.
The ID held up.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.480
In England. Outgoing.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.649
It is never the same as Incoming.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.319
We're inside the TSA,

02:44.330 --> 02:45.456

02:46.166 --> 02:47.417
Can I get you anything?

02:48.877 --> 02:49.878
Earplugs.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.589
Okay. I heard that.
And they're not gonna work

02:52.672 --> 02:54.465
because I'm talking inside your head.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.719
She knows. She didn't mean it literally.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.099
And you know he's only freaking out
because he loves you so much.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.605
You can't do anything now.
Let's let her sleep.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.783
You know, this whole visiting thing?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.077
It's a little like FaceTime
without a phone.

-Uh-oh.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.791
What? Wait, what?

03:28.875 --> 03:32.420
-TSA bumped up its warning level.
-Why?

03:32.503 --> 03:33.963
Another mass shooting.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.217
At this point, aren't mass shootings
just business as usual in America?

You've just turned an unbearably boring
piece of business

04:31.062 --> 04:32.855
into another rare pleasure.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.192
-I will come back.
-Mrs. Rasal, the priority is obvious here.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.195
And Raj, I must say, you're spending
too much time with me

04:39.279 --> 04:43.741
when you have a bride this beautiful
right here in the very same building.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.537
It makes me think I taught you nothing
at school, my friend.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.872
One of us has to work, Ajay.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.041

-Mrs. Rasal.
-[Rajan] Come, Kala.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.718
These shipping reports
have been falsified. Everything.

is approving has been doctored.

My God, Kala, you are even more beautiful
when you're upset.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.063
Rajan, please.
We're shipping out old antibiotics,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.815
discontinued HIV inhibitors.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.444
We're selling old, useless, defective,
and possibly poisonous drugs

05:19.527 --> 05:21.612
to people whose lives depend on them.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.115
I know this is not easy to hear
for the first time,

05:24.198 --> 05:26.284
but this is all standard procedure.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.871
We have to vacate our storage space.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.416
And our profit margins,
like every pharma company,

05:33.499 --> 05:36.919
depend on not wasting every drug
that's slightly below standard.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.797
You know?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.759
This is how this business works.
We all do it.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.136
Some of those drugs can still work.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.639
We are selling the only kind
that those people can afford.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.308
You have to trust me.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.186
This is the way to serve the greater good.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.439
What if your father
or what if I went to a hospital

05:56.522 --> 05:58.775
and was given improper, expired drugs?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.612
-That won't happen.
-Why not?

06:03.946 --> 06:06.699
Because these products
are shipped to distant places.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.118
We would never risk the lives
of our own people.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.079

I could do to try to change the world...

07:28.364 --> 07:31.659

were unskilled.

only leads to suffering.

Why can't I see where you are?

08:14.827 --> 08:18.122
You may feel gravity
without knowing how it works.

were much different back then.

Oh, so different.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.821
There were none of these mass shootings.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.951
-Oh, God. Did you see the terrible news?
-We just heard about it.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.245
They always want to blame it
on a religion,

08:57.328 --> 08:59.497

08:59.580 --> 09:02.124

wants to say--

-It's always a man.
-Some fucking dude not getting any.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.023
[Capheus] Mama?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.778
-Ah. Hello, my son.
-Hi, Mom.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.408
-This is Zakia, the girl I was...
-Ah! [laughs]

17:14.491 --> 17:16.452
Yes, of course.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.287
It's wonderful to finally meet you.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.580
It's great to meet you, too.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.458
Capheus told me about the work
that you do here with the kids.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.460
It is amazing.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.379
These children do far much more for us
than we could ever do for them.

17:27.463 --> 17:31.967
So the school focuses on teaching kids
different kinds of art?

17:32.051 --> 17:37.389
Yes. Art is fundamental to the development
of a child's imagination.

17:37.473 --> 17:42.186
One cannot create or achieve anything
unless they imagine it first.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.730
My son tells me
that you were educated in London?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.982
-Yes.
-What a gift.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.233
It was.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.154
He said that you were offered many jobs
but you decided to come back home.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.114
I know there's a lot of work to do here.

17:54.198 --> 17:58.202
There's too much injustice,
too much corruption, too much poverty.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.163
But I love Kenya, like your son does.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.623
My future is my country.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.211
Which is why I am so excited
about him running for office.

18:09.129 --> 18:09.963
What?

18:11.090 --> 18:11.924
Uh...

18:16.011 --> 18:19.014
Mama, I've been meaning
to tell you something.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.106
I used to sit here and think so much
about the future...

18:27.689 --> 18:30.442
trying to picture what my life
would be like.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.988
I never imagined anything like this.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.618
I don't think anyone knows
what life they will live.

18:41.203 --> 18:46.333
-That's what makes life feel alive.
-Hm...

18:48.335 --> 18:53.215
Do you think that is also true for people,
and if it is,

18:53.298 --> 18:56.260
does that mean that you can never
really know your own husband?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.304
Or your own brother.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.645
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable
with this level of uncertainty.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.440
No, but what is the alternative?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.236
[Priya] Kala?

19:15.696 --> 19:16.822
You have a visitor.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.490
We can stay with you.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.159
No, it's all right.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.870
We need to talk.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.877
-Hm?
-Hm.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.760
So you got these different voices
in your head, and one of them is Will?

19:39.803 --> 19:42.764
-I know it sounds strange.
-[chuckles]

19:44.933 --> 19:46.518
If he's in your head listening,

19:47.102 --> 19:49.730
does that mean he can hear
everything I'm saying?

19:50.772 --> 19:51.899
-Yeah.
-Yes.

19:53.859 --> 19:59.615
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck
at a rolling doughnut, Gorski,"

20:00.199 --> 20:01.200
he can hear that?

20:01.700 --> 20:02.743
Yeah.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.578
I deserve it.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.955
He says he deserves it.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.290
Damn right he does.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.501
Ask him why should I give a shit about him

20:11.585 --> 20:15.005
or his crazy-ass
"I hear voices" girlfriend

20:15.088 --> 20:17.216
when he obviously
doesn't give a shit about me?

20:24.556 --> 20:26.016
Your phone is about to ring.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.684
-Huh?
-[phone rings]

20:31.480 --> 20:35.025
Listen, D, I'm sorry.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.194
You can't just apologize
for something like this, man.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.488
Will you please
just let me try to explain, okay?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.448
All I'm asking for is two minutes.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.158
I don't have two minutes for you.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.411
Okay. All right, that's fine.
Will you just answer me one question?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.413
What?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.416
How many times did the Feds
or Homeland Security

20:51.500 --> 20:52.793
call you in for questioning?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.046
I don't think I can count that high, man.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.298
Well, you didn't tell them anything
because you didn't know anything.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.802
And that is why I couldn't call,
because I know you, D.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.346
I know how much you love being a cop.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.349
And a big part of why I love being a cop

21:07.432 --> 21:12.145
is being in that hot stinky car
every day with my best friend.

21:12.229 --> 21:16.400
I also know my best friend
is the shittiest liar I've ever met.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.530
If you lost your job lying to protect me,

21:21.613 --> 21:23.198
you couldn't be a cop anymore.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.576
I...

21:27.661 --> 21:29.329
I couldn't forgive myself for that.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.206
Part of being a best friend, man,

21:31.290 --> 21:33.583
is caring more about them
than you care about a damn job.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.545
Yeah, but you got a wife.
You got two beautiful kids.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.505
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.340
I miss them.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.593
I miss you.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.473
I miss my life.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.644
I'm trying to get it back.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.856
But I need your help.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.319
Okay.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.905
All right. What do you want me to do?

22:09.119 --> 22:10.287
[Rajan] You were right.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.873
I don't say this as an excuse,

22:12.956 --> 22:15.834
but only in trying
to understand it myself.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.881
I have been working in this company
since I was a child.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.385
I packed boxes when other kids
were playing football.

22:27.220 --> 22:31.391
As soon as I understood math,
my father taught me how to crunch margins.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.190
I was raised to believe in this company
the way other people believe in God.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.319
The more devout I was,
the more I sacrificed,

22:42.402 --> 22:44.571
the more I expanded my faith,

22:44.654 --> 22:47.157
then the more my god
would protect me and my family.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.785
Nothing has been more important.

22:49.868 --> 22:53.121
And this focus has caused me
to lose sight of...

22:55.165 --> 23:00.212
things that a man in my position
should never lose sight of.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.716
But I've changed everything now.

23:06.301 --> 23:09.638
This company is going to do things
differently from now on.

23:16.603 --> 23:22.109
Kala, the look in your eyes
made me see what you saw.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.277
And I hated it, too.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.613
You are my life.

23:26.696 --> 23:30.909
Everything else is... belongings.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.537
And more than anything...

23:35.872 --> 23:38.208
I want to be the man
you believed me to be.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.463
No, no, no! I forbid it!

23:43.547 --> 23:46.258
-Mama, I thought we were discussing it.
-There's nothing to discuss.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.512
Politics turns people into fools
and fools into thugs.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.597
Politics killed your father
and it's going to kill you.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.475
-I understand how you feel.
-Then why are we discussing it?

23:55.559 --> 23:56.476
I don't know.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.897
Maybe I've been looking around
and seeing things that are wrong...

24:01.565 --> 24:04.609
and wondering if there is anything
I can do to help fix them.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.948
Maybe I have too much of my father in me.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.410
Maybe I'm just as foolish as he was.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.290
We had the very same argument.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.750
[mother] Just tell me why.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.795
-I already said I will tell them no.
-But you want to tell them yes.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.796
I do.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.549
[mother] Tell me why,
when you know it's so dangerous.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.301
Because we cannot escape hope.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.012
The only hope we have
of making this country a better place

24:32.095 --> 24:33.763
is if we do it ourselves.

24:36.808 --> 24:37.934
I'm sorry.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.981
The last thing I want to do
is cause you pain.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.151
I will tell them I have to withdraw.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.614
You will do no such thing.

24:55.118 --> 25:01.833
All I ask is that you remember
that you are all I have left of him.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.095
Father, I'm sorry.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.934
If you hadn't come to the prison...

26:44.602 --> 26:46.604
if you hadn't cared about me...

26:49.649 --> 26:51.818
maybe you would still be alive.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.420
I feel lost.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.384
Everything I considered my home...

27:18.345 --> 27:19.429
is gone.

27:22.098 --> 27:25.268
Every time I begin to feel
I belong somewhere...

27:28.396 --> 27:30.231
I have to leave.

27:40.950 --> 27:46.122
I'm trapped between what I want
and what I know I can't have.

27:51.294 --> 27:55.048
Mom... I miss you.

27:59.552 --> 28:04.265
I measure so much of my life
against one afternoon with you.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.518
[cheering]

28:10.897 --> 28:14.692
I'm sorry, Mama. I lost the match.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.862
You fought someone almost twice your age.

28:19.406 --> 28:23.159
But I lost and made you sad.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.746
I'm not sad, Sun.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.083
Then why are you crying?

28:31.626 --> 28:34.045
Mothers worry for their daughters.

28:35.630 --> 28:39.551
I'm always afraid for you
when I come to these matches.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.430
But I'm not afraid.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.391
I know.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.185
That's why I'm crying.

28:50.228 --> 28:56.735
Your teacher told me he's never seen
a fighter as fearless as my daughter.

28:59.612 --> 29:05.285
When I watch you
and I see your fierce determination...

29:06.745 --> 29:10.081
I know that your life
will not be like mine...

29:12.250 --> 29:14.919
and that makes me very, very happy.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.308
That was the day you took me
to the Spring Festival.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.479
There is much of her in you.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.608
I was nourished by her.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.527
But Joong-Ki was too young.

29:40.111 --> 29:43.072
It was my duty to raise him in her place.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.619
But I failed.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.207
What happened was not your fault.

29:53.124 --> 29:57.295
A lot of people never get the kind of love
you got from your mother.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.590
I certainly didn't.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.259
But it didn't turn me into a murderer.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.846
That may be true.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.642
But it doesn't change the feeling
inside of me.

30:11.184 --> 30:15.021
I know feelings and emotions
can overwhelm our logic,

30:15.104 --> 30:16.731
and at the same time,

30:16.815 --> 30:20.735
logic can ruin the emotions
that make life worth living.

30:23.947 --> 30:27.367
My brother killed my father because of me.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.995
This is not a feeling. It is a fact.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.836
For many years after my father
was killed...

30:40.588 --> 30:43.007
I believed it was my duty to avenge him.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.054
I stole a gun.

30:50.056 --> 30:53.518
I imagined myself shooting the men
who killed him many times.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.145
But you never did.

30:59.649 --> 31:00.650
No.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.402
Why?

31:05.947 --> 31:07.282
My mother.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.536
Come. Sit with me.
I want to talk to you about your father.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.373
I asked her if she hated the men
who killed him...

31:17.834 --> 31:21.296
-and she said...
-I have no room in my heart for hate.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.438
I don't have a mother to give such advice.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.772
[Will] Maybe not.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.194
But you have us.

31:47.155 --> 31:51.993
Are you going to tell me...
I should trust in the law?

31:52.076 --> 31:53.286
No.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.374
My father was like your brother.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.753
The world is better off without them.

32:07.258 --> 32:10.261
I think I'm more confused
than I was before.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.888
[Lito] There's no easy answer, Sun.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.557
Whatever you decide to do...

32:16.059 --> 32:18.561
just know you won't have to do it alone.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.696
[man] I don't care where she is.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.032
[Lito laughing]

32:32.575 --> 32:33.701
Mr. Rodriguez, hi.

32:33.785 --> 32:34.911
-You cut your hair!
-Excuse me.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.204
You don't have
an appointment with him. Sir!

32:36.287 --> 32:38.164
Did you see it?

32:38.247 --> 32:39.624
Listen, I gotta call you back.

32:39.707 --> 32:40.833
Did you watch it?

32:41.417 --> 32:45.713
-Oh, yeah, I watched it.
-It has almost two million hits!

32:45.797 --> 32:47.590
[laughs]

32:47.674 --> 32:49.592
Oh, can you believe it?

32:50.677 --> 32:54.347
-It is incredible.
-Lito, this is a bit awkward.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.974
I thought your lawyer
was gonna talk to you.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.434
I know.
He said that I needed to talk to you.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.186
Oh, he did, did he?

33:01.729 --> 33:03.898
Okay. Let's do this.

33:04.857 --> 33:09.570
Before you start, I know I've been
having trouble finding the right project.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.614
-It's not that.
-I really think I needed to do this

33:11.698 --> 33:12.657
before I was ready.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.452
Well, I wish you would have
talked to us first.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.495
Why?

33:18.454 --> 33:20.039
Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.710
This agency no longer represents you.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.965
-What?
-Look, it has nothing to do with me.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.383
I mean, I even fought for you.

33:30.466 --> 33:35.346
You know, I think that what you're doing
is very, you know... It's important.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.640
-What are you talking about?
-There are certain high-level clients

33:37.724 --> 33:41.936
here at CMA who just, you know, they just
simply don't agree with your, um...

33:42.020 --> 33:43.938
I don't know, what do you want to call it?
Your lifestyle?

33:45.606 --> 33:48.609
-It's not a lifestyle.
-Whatever. Look, they told management

33:48.693 --> 33:53.406
in no uncertain terms
that it was either them or you. Okay?

33:54.282 --> 33:55.116
Who?

33:55.199 --> 33:57.952
Look, obviously this conversation
never took place, okay?

33:58.036 --> 34:02.957
I mean, we just decided to part ways,
and, you know, wish each other the best,

34:03.041 --> 34:07.462
and, uh, explore other opportunities,
et cetera. Blah, blah, blah.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.590
You said I was your guy.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.094
Well, you lied to us, too.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.685
[indistinct chatter]

34:45.166 --> 34:46.209
[elevator bell dings]

35:28.459 --> 35:29.627
Thank you.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.275
-Can I offer an opinion?
-[gasps]

35:53.651 --> 35:54.819
I came alone.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.781
I just want to talk. That's all.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.577
How did you know I would be here today?

36:02.660 --> 36:03.870
Well, I didn't.

36:05.746 --> 36:09.041
I've been here every morning
before my shift.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.587
I guessed if you did come,
it would be early.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.423
I knew it'd be important
for you to visit them.

36:17.049 --> 36:20.303
I'd have felt the same way
if my father committed suicide.

36:20.386 --> 36:24.015
My father did not commit suicide.
He was murdered.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.309
That is a strong allegation, Ms. Bak.

36:26.392 --> 36:30.271
It's not an allegation,
it is a fact, Detective.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.815
Do you then have evidence to prove it?

36:33.608 --> 36:35.067
I know what my brother has done.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.988
And I do not require you or the law
to believe me.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.656
Yeah? Why?

36:41.324 --> 36:44.785
Because I have seen your legal system
from inside and out.

36:44.869 --> 36:48.497
And the last thing
I would expect from it is justice.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.045
Look, Ms. Bak...

36:55.588 --> 36:58.716
I meant what I said to your teacher, okay?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.140
I'm on your side.

37:08.142 --> 37:12.605
We know that your brother is not the man
the media believes him to be.

37:12.688 --> 37:16.150
We suspect a lot of illegal money
is flowing through his company.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.694
We're just not able to prove it yet.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.906
Listen to yourself, Detective.

37:23.157 --> 37:24.742
Is this the system you serve?

37:25.326 --> 37:28.829
Yeah. The law is imperfect.

37:30.873 --> 37:35.294
I'm asking you to trust me
and I swear I will protect you.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.673
I don't need anyone's protection.

37:43.636 --> 37:44.887
Are you sure about that?

37:48.391 --> 37:50.768
I promised I only wanted to talk,

37:50.851 --> 37:55.064
so I'm not gonna stop you
if you prefer to leave.

37:55.147 --> 38:01.028
But... this today,
may be my last chance for a rematch.

38:03.906 --> 38:07.576
May I propose a test
to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.620
-[scoffs]
-A quick spar.

38:10.788 --> 38:14.625
If you win, you leave as you wish.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.878
But if I win...

38:19.463 --> 38:23.634
you come with me
and tell your story on the record.

38:25.094 --> 38:29.265
If you're not going to stop me,
I have no need to fight you.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.267
No, you don't need to.

38:32.268 --> 38:35.021
But I am hoping you want to.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.778
I have thought about our fight
at Mrs. Cho's apartment.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.656
A lot.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.952
I haven't thought about it at all.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.885
[exhales]

39:08.429 --> 39:09.555
All right.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.725
Show me what you've learned, Detective.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.589
When was the last time
you lost a fight, Ms. Bak?

39:44.215 --> 39:45.424
I can't remember.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.141
I remember that move from your fight
with King Kong Kim.

39:55.267 --> 39:59.105
He was the best fighter from our dojo
and you just cut him down

39:59.188 --> 40:00.564
like you were chopping a tree.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.031
Like that?

40:10.533 --> 40:11.867
Exactly like that.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.703
Had enough?

40:15.704 --> 40:16.872
No, Ms. Bak.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.793
Oh, no.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.686
You're thinking too much, Detective.

40:40.187 --> 40:42.189
My teacher says the same thing.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.526
[sighs]

40:45.609 --> 40:47.486
After I lost an important match,

40:48.279 --> 40:51.115
he told me that I worry too much
about what I should or shouldn't do.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.285
He says fighting is not something
you do with your head,

40:54.368 --> 40:56.328
it's something you do with your heart.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.291
You agree with him, Ms. Bak?

41:01.500 --> 41:05.421
I think you will profit
by spending more time with your teacher

41:05.504 --> 41:06.797
and less time pestering me.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.927
But this is much more fun.

41:14.013 --> 41:14.930
Come on.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.391
Let's go.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.824
I think I know why you never
remember your fights.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.245
You're not fighting a person.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.332
You're fighting something else.

41:41.999 --> 41:45.419
You used a false identity to fight
because of your father.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.173
I think he refused to see you...

41:50.508 --> 41:52.426
to understand how special you are.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.352
Ah!

42:15.074 --> 42:16.617
[both grunt]

43:49.376 --> 43:51.545
You have improved, Detective.

44:52.648 --> 44:56.318
It was almost a year ago
you kissed me right here.

45:08.163 --> 45:09.456
Riley, I, uh...

45:10.207 --> 45:14.420
I, uh... I know I've been acting...

45:16.296 --> 45:18.465
crazy lately.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.217
I don't mean to be.

45:20.300 --> 45:21.802
-I know.
-It's just...

45:23.512 --> 45:27.099
I've never loved anyone, anyone...

45:28.600 --> 45:30.102
the way that I love you.

45:46.743 --> 45:49.580
I promise I will come back to you.

45:54.626 --> 45:57.087
It's the waiting that's the hard part.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.673
-I know.
-It's, uh...

45:59.756 --> 46:01.717
Do you think it's gonna be much longer?

46:03.469 --> 46:04.553
No.

46:05.929 --> 46:09.349
It could be tomorrow...
it could be next week.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.894
Or it could be right now.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.937
Which it so happens it is.

46:15.981 --> 46:16.940
He's here?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.359
The Archipelago has spoken.

46:20.402 --> 46:21.904
I've been given an address.

46:22.404 --> 46:25.782
You must go there. You must go now.

46:27.910 --> 46:32.122
-Oh! What? Whispers. Where?
-Oh! Sorry. Sorry. So sorry.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.999
But you are gonna freak out, too.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.460
-What?
-I couldn't sleep.

46:36.543 --> 46:39.087
I was curious about the shooting
everyone's been talking about.

46:39.171 --> 46:40.422
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.467
And one of the people killed was
this British politician, Mitchell Taylor.

46:43.550 --> 46:46.094
He was giving a speech when it happened.

46:46.178 --> 46:48.639
This is not out of some woolly desire

46:48.722 --> 46:51.725
to sit in a circle
and sing Lennon's "Imagine."

46:51.808 --> 46:54.770
This is to remind people
that free societies...

46:55.354 --> 46:57.272
are stronger societies.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.775
-Is he speaking at a mosque?
-Uh-huh.

46:59.858 --> 47:00.984
Is he Muslim?

47:01.068 --> 47:04.613
No. It was some kind of peace congregation
with all kinds of people,

47:04.696 --> 47:06.907
Jews, Muslims, Christians, Atheists.

47:06.990 --> 47:10.577
Since the invention of cities,
open, multicultural societies

47:10.661 --> 47:15.290
are the places that the world's
best and brightest have wanted to go to,

47:15.374 --> 47:18.961
while mono-cultural, repressive societies

47:19.044 --> 47:21.255
are the places they've wanted
to escape from.

47:22.089 --> 47:25.050
[screaming]

47:26.051 --> 47:27.177
Oh, my God.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.763
Oh, those poor people.

47:34.434 --> 47:35.894
[Amanita] It's horrible.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.939
What happened to the killer?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.692
He tries to shoot himself.

47:41.775 --> 47:43.068
How much better would the world be

47:43.151 --> 47:45.237
if these guys
would just start with themselves?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.948
Right? But look, just before he shoots.

47:49.449 --> 47:51.910
Good. They caught him.

47:52.619 --> 47:53.579
Yeah.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.207
But the whole thing seemed so sad.

47:57.291 --> 48:01.211
I mean, this guy Taylor trying to do
something about our fear of otherness,

48:01.295 --> 48:02.462
then I got drawn in.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.757
I started reading all of his tweets,
and posts, and interviews,

48:05.841 --> 48:09.261
and I was thinking how the Internet
is a kind of psycellium,

48:09.344 --> 48:11.430
like what you experienced
in the woods with Angelica,

48:11.513 --> 48:15.017
where memories and moments of our lives
exist beyond us...

48:16.518 --> 48:17.728
when I saw this...

48:21.273 --> 48:22.816
[Nomi] Ruth El-Saadawi?

48:23.400 --> 48:24.234
Freaky enough?

48:25.527 --> 48:28.155
Then I started thinking
like you're thinking,

48:28.238 --> 48:31.992
maybe a coincidence is not a coincidence,

48:32.075 --> 48:34.786
when my phone pinged and I screamed.

48:35.912 --> 48:37.623
They put the killer in jail,

48:37.706 --> 48:40.125
but they didn't release his identity
until now.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.422
Todd.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.008
Oh, my God.

48:50.927 --> 48:51.762
Oh, my God.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.192
Oh, no.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.443
Of course.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.737
You gotta be shitting me.

49:09.529 --> 49:10.364
Come on.

49:10.447 --> 49:11.490
Riley.

49:42.187 --> 49:45.023
Okay, I'm officially creeped out.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.067
I don't like this, Riles.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.903
We'll find another way to get to Whispers.

49:49.986 --> 49:52.989
Will! Riley!
I know why Whispers has been missing.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.449
He's been trapped in prison.

49:54.533 --> 49:58.745
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder
a politician named Mitchell Taylor.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.289
Holy shit.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.375
The church?

50:04.126 --> 50:05.168
Why?

50:05.836 --> 50:07.629
This is where the meeting
is supposed to be.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.923
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.

50:13.885 --> 50:14.928
Riley?

50:15.011 --> 50:16.263
Oh, my God.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.900
-He said I had to go down the stairs.
-Who did?

50:29.484 --> 50:30.694
Mr. Hoy.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.487
If you want my professional
police opinion,

50:32.571 --> 50:34.364
I say there's no way in hell
I'd go down there.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.574
Yes, thank you.

50:36.199 --> 50:37.909
Especially because if this was a movie,

50:37.993 --> 50:41.913
this would be the scene where the funny
but annoying sidekick gets whacked.

50:41.997 --> 50:43.540
He said I have to go alone.

50:43.623 --> 50:45.709
Well, that solves my problem.

50:46.668 --> 50:48.503
-I'll be in the car.
-D!

50:49.880 --> 50:51.840
Will, BPO doesn't work like this.

50:52.674 --> 50:54.968
This is someone who's very frightened.

50:55.051 --> 50:58.430
And if I was gonna do what they're
about to do, then I'd be scared, too.

51:47.229 --> 51:49.856
I did a scene like this
in Forgive Us Our Trespasses.

51:50.273 --> 51:51.316
What happened?

51:53.109 --> 51:54.277
Everyone died.

51:55.821 --> 51:56.947
Not helpful.

52:21.930 --> 52:22.973
No.

52:27.894 --> 52:29.437
It is a test.

52:32.190 --> 52:33.567
They need to know that I'm alone.

52:34.526 --> 52:35.569
No.

52:50.417 --> 52:51.585
Five minutes.

52:52.168 --> 52:53.795
In five minutes, I send in Diego.

53:17.944 --> 53:20.363
I needed to know how far you would go.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.575
I needed to know if I could trust you.

53:24.451 --> 53:25.702
I understand.

53:27.495 --> 53:29.497
It's strange to finally meet.

53:31.207 --> 53:34.794
In a way, you and your cluster exist
because of me.

53:36.254 --> 53:38.298
You work with Professor Kolovi.

53:39.549 --> 53:40.842
You helped Angelica escape.

53:43.511 --> 53:46.806
We both realized
she was going to birth another cluster.

53:48.683 --> 53:50.435
After what happened to her first...

53:51.186 --> 53:53.563
I knew she would die
before she let that happen again.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.775
Why here?

53:57.901 --> 54:02.405
Angelica heard me singing one day
and asked where I'd learned.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.075
And I told her about this church.

54:06.409 --> 54:08.578
It was her idea to come here.

54:11.039 --> 54:13.249
Why did Angelica work with BPO?

54:13.333 --> 54:15.377
She was searching for her children.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.713
What happened to them?

54:18.797 --> 54:22.300
None of us fully realized
how fast BPO was changing.

54:24.135 --> 54:28.431
When I first started,
it was very, very different.

54:28.515 --> 54:31.309
Dr. El-Saadawi was a visionary.

54:32.185 --> 54:33.853
I met her at Stanford.

54:33.937 --> 54:39.776
And the work I did with her
felt like something... sacred.

54:41.444 --> 54:47.867
When she died, I hoped Professor Kolovi
would continue what she began.

54:48.994 --> 54:53.415
I don't know. Maybe he believed
in her work once, but... not now.

54:55.750 --> 54:59.671
Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.967
That's the first name I knew him by.

55:04.509 --> 55:06.553
When he came to the university,

55:06.636 --> 55:11.224
he had research, data on the development
of the sensorium frontal lobe

55:11.307 --> 55:13.476
that we were all desperate for.

55:14.602 --> 55:17.939
Of course, we all suspected
how he came about this information,

55:18.023 --> 55:19.899
but nobody wanted to ask.

55:19.983 --> 55:23.820
But still, Brandt never would have solved
the problems of the neural graft

55:23.903 --> 55:25.321
without Angelica.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.532
Neural graft?

55:28.116 --> 55:30.201
It's mimics the connection of a cluster,

55:30.285 --> 55:33.913
overriding the consciousness
of one sensorium onto another.

55:34.706 --> 55:35.540
Why?

55:36.666 --> 55:37.876
I'm an academic.

55:38.626 --> 55:40.879
Even when I heard you
coming down the stairs,

55:40.962 --> 55:43.590
I wasn't sure I would be able
to go through with this.

55:44.215 --> 55:46.926
But I know what happened in New York.

55:47.510 --> 55:50.930
When I watched those poor,
innocent people killed...

55:57.645 --> 56:02.817
If it's within our power to keep
something that terrible from happening...

56:05.653 --> 56:07.072
shouldn't we?

56:17.123 --> 56:19.042
Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?

56:20.335 --> 56:21.294
Whispers.

56:21.836 --> 56:26.716
She told me, the voice in your head
that tells you to cut your wrists,

56:26.800 --> 56:30.804
or to take a handful of pills,
or to jump from a height...

56:32.138 --> 56:33.973
that voice never shouts.

56:34.724 --> 56:35.683
It only whispers.

56:51.783 --> 56:52.700
Thank you.

57:13.555 --> 57:14.889
He sleeps on blockers.

57:16.391 --> 57:18.393
I couldn't reach him a few hours ago.

57:20.186 --> 57:22.272
So you don't know for certain
if he's in there?

57:23.189 --> 57:24.149
No.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.528
Every moment we stand here, he could wake.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.196
She's right.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.537
This is it.

57:37.912 --> 57:40.290
Are you really ready
to kill a man in cold blood?

57:41.416 --> 57:42.584
Jonas?

57:43.126 --> 57:44.335
Hello, Will.
