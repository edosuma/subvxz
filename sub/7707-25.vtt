00:07.641 --> 00:10.976
The great orange hunter

00:10.978 --> 00:13.946
stalks his prey.

00:20.721 --> 00:25.257
Ah! He sees it.
The elusive loin of pork.

00:25.259 --> 00:29.995
The most prized catch
in the Fridgidari Jungle.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.297
What's this?

00:32.299 --> 00:34.600
"ALF, don't eat this."

00:35.503 --> 00:37.136
Why would I eat this?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.739
Ever so deftly..

00:40.741 --> 00:44.009
...the great orange hunter
maneuvers his weapon.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.911
Once in position

00:45.913 --> 00:47.446
he strikes!

00:47.448 --> 00:48.947
[rumbling]

00:51.185 --> 00:54.620
What? Whoa!
Has the hunter angered the Gods?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.390
[rumbling continues]

00:58.392 --> 01:01.493
Whoa! Uh!

01:01.495 --> 01:04.229
Okay, I won't eat pork!

01:06.167 --> 01:08.634
[theme music]

01:39.433 --> 01:41.700
[music continues]

02:08.529 --> 02:10.929
(Willie)
'Is everybody alright?
Lynn? Brian?'

02:10.931 --> 02:12.131
(Lynn)
'I'm fine, dad.'

02:12.133 --> 02:13.966
(Brian)
'Me too, but I can't find ALF!'

02:13.968 --> 02:16.802
(Willie)
'ALF? ALF?'

02:20.441 --> 02:21.707
- Oh!
- Are you in here?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.041
He's not in the attic.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.511
- Look at this mess.
- ALF!

02:25.513 --> 02:27.546
ALF!

02:27.548 --> 02:28.914
This was his first quake.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.350
Poor little fella,
he must be terrified.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.754
I found him!

02:35.756 --> 02:37.523
- ALF, are you okay?
- He doesn't look good.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.926
It looks like he's in shock.
ALF, say something. Anything.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.861
Armageddon! Annihilation!

02:42.863 --> 02:45.097
White hot tentacles
of doom spit fire!

02:45.099 --> 02:47.466
Venom! Screeching!
Help me! Help me!

02:47.468 --> 02:48.767
- ALF.
- Help me! Help me!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.002
- Ruination! Devastation..
- ALF!

02:50.004 --> 02:51.703
Apocalypse now! Now, now..

02:53.274 --> 02:54.439
Thanks, Willie.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.441
Now I'm blind.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.010
Your eyes are closed.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.979
Oh.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.748
Here, let me help you.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.653
Oh, this may stagger
your imagination a whit

03:07.655 --> 03:10.455
but I had nothing
to do with this mess.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.057
We know, ALF,
we know.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.960
- You do?
- We had an earthquake.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.797
- I see.
- And it was a good one.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.733
What was good about it?
Why do we have it?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.468
What was it?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.737
Well, let me see
if I can explain it, ALF.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.573
You see, the crust of our planet

03:27.575 --> 03:30.008
is made of plates
of layered rock

03:30.010 --> 03:32.311
that are in continual movement.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.546
Now, when the pressure
beneath becomes

03:34.548 --> 03:35.914
too great,
it's released through--

03:35.916 --> 03:38.383
Thank you, Mr. Wizard.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.353
Kate, the short strokes, please.

03:41.355 --> 03:45.390
Do you remember when
Godzilla destroyed Tokyo?

03:45.392 --> 03:48.994
Well, that's a rather
extreme example, Kate.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.064
Raymond Burr analogies
are rarely pretty.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.200
Look, we-we just
had an earthquake

03:55.202 --> 03:56.835
and we are all fine.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.170
We just have to
remember to be prepared

03:58.172 --> 04:01.740
and follow some
basic safety rules.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.177
Willie, get the ledger!
Kate has more rules!

04:05.179 --> 04:07.946
(Raquel)
'Kate? Willie?
Is anybody home?'

04:07.948 --> 04:10.215
(Kate)
ALF, get in the kitchen.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.185
Uh, that is,
stay in the kitchen.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.689
- Oh, hi, Raquel.
- Willie, Kate.

04:17.691 --> 04:21.226
- We had an earthquake!
- Uh, so did we.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.161
- How's Lynn?
- Oh, Lynn's fine.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.963
- Does she need comforting?
- Oh, no, she's fine.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.099
- 'Cause if she does, I could--
- She's fine!

04:27.101 --> 04:30.602
- Glad to hear it.
- So where's Trevor?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.104
On the porch.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.173
Trevor, come on in.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.546
Is this structural?

04:41.548 --> 04:43.248
Yes, I believe so.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.685
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to stand here.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.021
Trevor, I-I've never
seen you like this.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.092
Oh-oh-oh, Trevor,
it's-it's gonna be alright.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.962
It-it-it's gonna be alright.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.898
Trevor, this is making me
very uncomfortable.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.437
I'm sorry.
I'm just traumatized.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.106
He always acts like this
after an earthquake.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.842
Or whenever Whoopi Goldberg's
on "Star Trek."

05:12.846 --> 05:14.913
You know, Trevor, uh

05:14.915 --> 05:17.316
statistically you have
more chance of being injured

05:17.318 --> 05:20.452
in your own bathtub
than you have in an earthquake.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.820
Oh, yeah?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.422
When's the last time
your bathtub opened up

05:23.424 --> 05:26.825
and swallowed you streaming into
the fiery bowels of the earth?

05:28.295 --> 05:30.128
He's got me there.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.164
Well, we'll be on our way.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.499
We just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.369
And say hi to Lynn,
and everybody for me.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.738
- Trevor, you'll be fine.
- You think so?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.873
Of course.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.142
With the proper
professional assistance.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.082
We live on a planet
with fiery bowels?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.485
Trevor was just overreacting.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.388
You know, I'd hate to see him
in a big earthquake.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.491
But we just
had a big earthquake.

05:59.493 --> 06:03.562
- Didn't we?
- They can be bigger.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.097
How much bigger?

06:06.233 --> 06:07.599
A little bigger.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.203
Can they be a lot bigger?

06:11.205 --> 06:14.639
Well, yes, sometimes.
Not often, though.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.341
Just-just relax, ALF.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.245
Right...relax.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.883
Is this thing structural?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.853
[instrumental music]

06:32.059 --> 06:34.159
You know, in a way,
that jolt we had last night

06:34.161 --> 06:36.561
was probably a very good thing.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.398
If you enjoyed it that much,
why not just strap

06:39.400 --> 06:44.035
a lightning rod on your head
and wander around in the rain?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.737
No, I think what
Willie means is that

06:45.739 --> 06:48.407
it's reminded us to come out
and check our supplies.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.108
It says here
that we should have

06:50.110 --> 06:53.111
a half gallon of water
a day for each of us.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.281
So for two weeks,
that makes 35 gallons.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.850
Well, hey, yeah.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.752
Uh..

07:00.754 --> 07:03.688
Hey! Ahem.
35 gallons of water.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.124
Wait, I have questions.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.727
Why do we need
so much bottled water?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.629
Well, that's in case
our water supply

07:10.631 --> 07:11.997
becomes contaminated.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.465
What about food?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.268
We have a two-week
supply of food.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.371
We have peanut butter,
we have granola bars

07:19.373 --> 07:23.975
evaporated milk,
canned meat, fish.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.744
We had a two-week supply
of peanut butter

07:25.746 --> 07:29.881
granola bars, evaporated milk,
canned meat and fish.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.751
It was nowhere near
a two-week supply.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.086
I ate it in 37 minutes.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.624
ALF, those were
our survival rations.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.860
And I survived.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.962
Now, you know they work.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.966
Restock foodstuffs.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.968
Padlock foodstuffs.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.471
[instrumental music]

07:58.712 --> 08:00.479
I, uh, saw the truck outside.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.814
I guess the extra water
we ordered came.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.684
Oh, yes, water came.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.986
Last load.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.630
Four hundred and
seventy-six dollars.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.068
I'm afraid, uh, we didn't
order this much water.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.572
You got a Gordon Shumway
at this address?

08:27.574 --> 08:30.175
Just once, I was hoping
that just once

08:30.177 --> 08:33.478
it might be
a legitimate mistake.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.315
Uh, say, I don't suppose
there's a chance

08:37.317 --> 08:40.519
you could take a couple dozen
of these back?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.222
That's pickup.
I'm delivery.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.459
Well, goodbye, or as we
like to say<i> au reservoir.</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:54.833
What'll it be? Cup of soup?

08:54.835 --> 08:57.135
Cocoa with teeny marshmallows?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.771
Or maybe just the
straight stuff straight up.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.242
I know that look.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.280
I find it unsettling.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.616
[instrumental music]

09:12.553 --> 09:13.585
[hammering]

09:16.757 --> 09:18.290
ALF?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.160
Oh, hi, Willie.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.362
What are you doing?

09:24.364 --> 09:26.298
Hammering.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.567
Could you be
a little more specific?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.402
Hammering nails.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.506
Why are you nailing
your bed to the floor?

09:34.508 --> 09:37.075
Well, it wouldn't make much
sense to Scotch tape it

09:37.077 --> 09:39.044
now, would it?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.180
ALF, nailing your bed down

09:42.182 --> 09:44.516
isn't gonna help you
during an earthquake.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.385
It'll keep me from
sliding down the stairs.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.154
Then I'm running
a bumper around the bed

09:49.156 --> 09:50.655
for shock absorption.

09:50.657 --> 09:55.360
And underneath, in case of
a tidal wave...pontoons.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.962
I'm telling you, Willie,
this bed is gonna be

09:56.964 --> 10:00.031
the safest place in the house.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.800
ALF, I really don't--

10:01.802 --> 10:03.368
I know what you're gonna say

10:03.370 --> 10:05.503
and I could put you
in one of these babies

10:05.505 --> 10:08.707
for 99.95, yes?

10:08.709 --> 10:11.676
That's 99.95.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.044
[screaming]

10:13.046 --> 10:14.713
It's okay, ALF.
It's an aftershock.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.415
- Come into the doorway!
- I'll be safer in here!

10:18.819 --> 10:20.852
Oh-h-h.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.724
Two seconds later,
and I would have had

10:25.726 --> 10:29.127
the weight of the world
where my head used to be.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.398
No, ALF, that-that-that's
only a globe.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.067
That wouldn't have hurt you.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.203
Don't you see, Willie?

10:38.205 --> 10:40.372
It's a sign.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.340
No matter what you do

10:42.342 --> 10:44.843
no matter how many
precautions you take

10:44.845 --> 10:47.479
sooner or later
this planet is gonna get ya.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.749
Oh, take it easy, ALF.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.283
You'll be fine.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.552
Yeah, but for how long?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.421
Face it, Willie.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.691
Earth is hazardous
to your health.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.895
[instrumental music]

11:08.802 --> 11:09.735
[instrumental music]

11:09.736 --> 11:10.669
I know this is hard
for you to understand, Bri.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.338
It's hard for me
to understand too.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.241
Sometimes it's Bert Convy,
sometimes it's Vicki Lawrence

11:16.243 --> 11:18.309
sometimes it's Sally Struthers.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.911
But no matter who hosts

11:19.913 --> 11:22.313
it's always
"Win, Lose Or Draw."

11:23.417 --> 11:25.350
That's a load off my mind.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.452
[knock on door]

11:27.454 --> 11:28.987
(Jake)
'It's me. Jake!'

11:28.989 --> 11:30.555
It's open.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.792
- Hey, guys!
- Morning, Jake!

11:33.794 --> 11:34.893
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.728
Hi, Jake,
so how did your Uncle Trevor

11:36.730 --> 11:38.797
handle that
aftershock last night?

11:38.799 --> 11:42.200
Not too well. He started
sleepin' in the doorway.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.070
Well, that's just silly.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.573
I know, but at least he wakes up
with the morning paper handy.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.744
Willie..

11:52.746 --> 11:54.879
...just let me look at ya.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.283
Kate!

11:59.186 --> 12:02.187
Funny, special Kate.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.490
Lynn, why..

12:05.492 --> 12:07.325
Why, you're a woman now.

12:09.663 --> 12:13.565
Brian...is this
the little boy I carried?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
And, Jake..

12:17.337 --> 12:19.270
What is a friend?

12:19.272 --> 12:22.240
A friend...is Jake.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.246
Let's all just...be.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.917
You wanna stay
for breakfast, Jake?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.519
Okay. Here.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.654
Ah, the complex parade

12:36.656 --> 12:38.757
that is life.

12:38.759 --> 12:42.026
ALF, is this something
we should be asking you about?

12:42.028 --> 12:44.496
It's simple, oh, my Willie.

12:44.498 --> 12:47.132
Last night's
narrowly averted tragedy

12:47.134 --> 12:48.933
gave me pause.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.302
I thought you already had paws.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.805
Ha ha ha ha ha.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.242
Witty, urbane Lynn.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.977
[laughs]

12:58.979 --> 13:00.278
What I meant was

13:00.280 --> 13:02.647
it gave me pause to think.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.183
I've been trying
to escape my fate

13:05.185 --> 13:07.218
but there is no escape!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.220
If an earthquake doesn't get me

13:09.222 --> 13:11.122
a monsoon might.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.423
Or an avalanche.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.759
Or a firestorm.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.529
Or...food poisoning.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.999
What is your point?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.467
My point is

13:22.469 --> 13:25.637
any breath I draw
could be my last.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.873
So I'm going to savor
every moment I have left.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.411
There goes one now.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.481
What's wrong with ALF?

13:36.483 --> 13:37.916
Nothing's wrong with me.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.652
I've simply adopted
a new philosophy.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.321
Eat, drink, and be merry.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.659
- For tomorrow we croak.
- Tomorrow?

13:47.661 --> 13:51.462
It's just an expression, Brian,
albeit a mangled one.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.164
Are you sure
you're alright, ALF?

13:53.166 --> 13:56.734
I'm fine.
In fact, I'm perfect.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.537
Come on, everyone,
let's all join hands

13:59.539 --> 14:01.973
for a chorus of "Kumbaya."

14:04.211 --> 14:05.677

14:09.015 --> 14:10.381

14:10.383 --> 14:11.583

14:16.089 --> 14:18.823

Lynnocence

14:24.464 --> 14:26.931
my lovely flower of spring

14:26.933 --> 14:29.801
seeing you brings
a lump to my throat.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.603
Not unlike a goiter.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.172
ALF, that's gross.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.807
Alright, a bunion.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.210
I really don't have
time for this.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.612
I've got to learn this French

14:40.614 --> 14:43.348
plus I've got
a history final tomorrow.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.650
History is history!

14:45.652 --> 14:49.320
What's important is today,
now, this moment.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.623
Savor, Lynn.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.925
Look, ALF,
if I don't study today

14:53.927 --> 14:57.896
I'll be savoring failure
about 9:45 tomorrow morning.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.399
How many temblors will it
take for you to see the light?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.968
We've only had two.

15:03.970 --> 15:09.207
Well...perhaps I'm more
introspective than you.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.543
Well, when I think of
all the moments on Melmac

15:12.545 --> 15:14.712
that are lost forever

15:14.714 --> 15:17.415
because I didn't take
the time to savor them.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.952
Like the time,
Benny Fudderman and I..

15:22.522 --> 15:24.155
See, I forgot.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.324
Oh!

15:26.326 --> 15:28.660
If only I had savored.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.264
Lynn...take a tip.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.435
Be...here...now.

15:38.471 --> 15:42.840
You take a tip.
Be...gone...now.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.010
I take my leave.

15:46.012 --> 15:50.682
If you need me, I'll be out
with God watching Brian grow.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.917
- Right.
- Oh, and Lynn..

15:53.954 --> 15:55.453
I love you.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.658
[instrumental music]

16:02.662 --> 16:05.830
What if I talk dad into moving
someplace where it's safe?

16:05.832 --> 16:09.000
- Like where?
- I don't know.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.435
Kansas?

16:10.437 --> 16:13.371
You could be
blown away by a tornado.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.707
How about Hawaii?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.842
The volcanoes will get ya.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.145
- Canada?
- Blizzards!

16:21.147 --> 16:23.648
- Florida?
- Old age!

16:24.584 --> 16:27.318
So live, Brian, live!

16:27.320 --> 16:30.555
Because...sooner or later..

16:33.426 --> 16:34.859
ALF!

16:34.861 --> 16:38.596
- Hey, ALF, Brian.
- Hey, Jake.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.165
Jake...less than a brother

16:41.167 --> 16:43.301
more than a friend,
have you been sav--

16:43.303 --> 16:46.904
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been
savorin' life left and right.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.908
That's good.
Because life is like death row.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.812
And every day you live
is a stay of execution

16:54.814 --> 16:58.282
until the one day when
the big governor in the sky

16:58.284 --> 17:00.852
doesn't make that phone call.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.920
I think I'll go
inside for a while.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.623
Okay, B.
Hey, savor your parents for me.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.291
Oh, and Brian!

17:07.293 --> 17:09.494
- What?
- I love you.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.966
Don't you think
you might be scarin' the kid?

17:14.968 --> 17:19.470
Scarin' him? I'm teaching him
how to enjoy life.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.440
- Have it your way.
- Oh, Jake..

17:22.442 --> 17:25.043
In case this is the last time
we see each other--

17:25.045 --> 17:27.678
Will you cut out
all this last-time stuff?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.349
I'm just goin' home!
What's gonna happen to me there?

17:31.351 --> 17:34.719
Well, you could slip in the tub,
choke on your dinner

17:34.721 --> 17:37.622
fall down the stairs,
trip over the dog

17:37.624 --> 17:39.123
accidentally flush yourself--

17:39.125 --> 17:41.492
I'll come back
when you're in a better mood.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.529
Oh, hey, Jake!
I love you!

17:44.531 --> 17:46.864
And I mean that.

17:46.866 --> 17:47.999
Truly.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.202
[instrumental music]

17:52.939 --> 17:56.574
- Brian?
- 'Hi, dad.'

17:56.576 --> 17:59.811
- Brian?
- 'I'm under here.'

17:59.813 --> 18:02.547
Well, pfft, we've been looking
all over for you.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.282
What are you doing
under the bed?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.318
- 'This is where I live now.'
- What?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.755
(Brian)
'This way, if anything happens
I'll be safe.'

18:10.757 --> 18:14.959
- Safe from what?
- 'Well, everything.'

18:16.463 --> 18:19.797
(Willie)
It's no good keeping things
like this inside.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.232
If something's bothering you

18:21.234 --> 18:24.535
it's important
to-to tell somebody about it.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.604
I agree, honey.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.072
Hi, Kate.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.241
But why are you talking
to Brian's bed?

18:31.411 --> 18:32.877
(Brian)
'Hi, mom.'

18:32.879 --> 18:34.512
Bri?

18:34.514 --> 18:36.948
Bri, what are you
doing under there?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.150
It's the only place
he feels safe.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.620
Brian..

18:42.622 --> 18:44.655
Why-why are you so frightened?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.858
(Brian)
'Because tomorrow we croak.'

18:47.994 --> 18:50.595
Why does that sound familiar?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.130
Listen, Brian, uh..

18:52.132 --> 18:54.932
none of us
is going to croak

18:55.869 --> 18:57.702
for a long, long time.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.837
(Brian)
'You can't be sure.'

18:59.839 --> 19:03.241
No, but...I can be almost sure.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.477
And I'll tell you
something I am sure of.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.012
If you spend you're whole life

19:08.014 --> 19:11.215
worrying about all
the bad things that could happen

19:11.217 --> 19:13.484
you're gonna miss
all the good things

19:13.486 --> 19:14.986
that will happen.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.256
Oh, there you guys are!

19:18.258 --> 19:20.424
I want to savor you.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.460
Oh, good, good.
You can start with Brian.

19:22.462 --> 19:26.063
- He's under the bed.
- What's he doing under there?

19:26.065 --> 19:29.767
Have you ever heard of
catastrophic expectations?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.068
Of course.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.404
It's a Melmacian dating service.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.742
No, ALF,
catastrophic expectations

19:37.744 --> 19:40.745
means you live your life
fearing the worst.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.315
So?

19:44.317 --> 19:47.718
So that's exactly
what you've been doing!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.854
Hey, if you've got
a good thing going

19:49.856 --> 19:53.057
I say stick with it.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.592
We don't care
if you stick with it

19:54.594 --> 19:56.861
but you're scaring Brian.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.764
Oh, he's savoring dust bunnies.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.466
Come on out, B.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.869
(Brian)
'I'm not coming out.
I'm never coming out!'

20:05.838 --> 20:08.673
Whoa-ho-ho.
Extreme!

20:10.009 --> 20:12.543
There's nothing wrong
with living cautiously.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.947
But if you spend each day
focusing on mortality

20:15.949 --> 20:18.149
each day a little piece of you

20:18.151 --> 20:20.651
is going to experience
that mortality.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.620
Do you understand me, ALF?

20:22.622 --> 20:25.389
No.

20:25.391 --> 20:30.661
(Brian)
'I do. You mean don't be scared
of stuff until it happens.'

20:30.663 --> 20:32.797
Gee, Willie,
why didn't you say that?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.066
I thought I did.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.668
All I wanna know is

20:37.670 --> 20:40.171
does this leave room
for savoring?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.740
Of course it does, ALF.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.775
Just savor life out of joy

20:44.777 --> 20:46.711
not out of fear.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.313
So what you're saying is

20:49.315 --> 20:51.382
we should eat, drink,
and be merry

20:51.384 --> 20:53.951
for tomorrow we eat, drink,
and be merry again.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.921
Let's try,
eat, drink

20:56.923 --> 20:59.757
and clean up
anything you spill.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.794
Why don't you come out
from under the bed, Bri?

21:06.966 --> 21:09.634
- Feeling better?
- A little.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.902
Hey, sorry
if I scared you, B.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.105
No problem.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.141
- Uh, you wouldn't want to--
- The helmet stays.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.490
I got a promotion.
Just my luck, huh?

21:32.492 --> 21:36.394
Well, uh, I guess this covers
the delivery and the, uh

21:36.396 --> 21:40.631
thirty-five gallons we are
keeping a-a-and the pickup.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.267
Can you throw a little somethin'
in here for my chiropractor?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.171
No.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.406
Yeah.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.341
Well, thanks for everything.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.083
Hey, is all my water gone?

22:00.219 --> 22:02.453
Yes, thankfully.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.356
Well, that's too bad.
I had a great idea.

22:05.358 --> 22:08.192
- Wanna hear about it?
- Not especially.

22:08.194 --> 22:13.864
But it's hot. It's now,
it's quintessential late '80s.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.567
Would you speak
no more about this?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.469
Fine.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.004
But without the water slide

22:20.006 --> 22:22.907
