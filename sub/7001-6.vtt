01:14.229 --> 01:18.580
I want you to sit down
so I can wash this horrible jacket.

01:18.669 --> 01:21.340
Enough. I don't want to hear
another word out of you guys.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.179
Sit down.

01:23.269 --> 01:27.419
Boy, you really did it this time, didn't you?
You really did it.

01:27.509 --> 01:31.580
I just wanna thank you, boys,
for the most embarrassing night of my life.

01:31.669 --> 01:34.019
We are the only family in 12 years

01:34.110 --> 01:39.130
to have been kicked out of
Wacky Jack's Pizza Pagoda.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.259
It takes a lot of work
to get kicked out of a restaurant

01:41.350 --> 01:44.540
that has a trampoline
and a batting cage.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.900
- But Dad…
- No buts. That's it.

01:47.989 --> 01:52.699
It was Wacky Jack's fault.
He was making those stupid faces at us.

01:52.790 --> 01:55.459
He's a clown. That's his job.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.330
- We didn't do anything.
- We didn't do anything.

01:59.429 --> 02:02.140
Does this look familiar?
Wacky Jack's nose.

02:02.229 --> 02:05.659
You pulled it right off his face.

02:05.749 --> 02:08.019
- It's not his real nose.
- I don't care whose nose it is.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.019
Don't pull things off people's faces.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.179
Hey. You know what
you guys are gonna do?

02:12.269 --> 02:14.780
You're gonna take this nose,
you're gonna put it in an envelope,

02:14.870 --> 02:17.820
you're gonna sign a little apology note
and send it back to Wacky Jack.

02:17.909 --> 02:20.019
And right now you're gonna get
out of my sight.

02:20.110 --> 02:22.300
- Go up to your rooms. March. March.
- Up. Up. Up.

02:22.390 --> 02:24.769
If I hear any noise upstairs.
I'll be up there.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.100
and if I have to come up there
you won't want me up there.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.419
- We weren't even doing anything.
- No, quiet. Now.

02:29.509 --> 02:31.380
We want to watch Full House
and we didn't do it.

02:31.469 --> 02:32.499
No.

02:32.590 --> 02:35.340
I just want you to know
I'm innocent.

02:35.429 --> 02:36.699
Innocent.

02:36.790 --> 02:41.499
Pouring salad dressing
down your brother's pants?

02:41.590 --> 02:44.900
- Oh. You saw that?
- Yeah, I saw that.

02:46.229 --> 02:49.140
Tim, this is pathetic.

02:49.229 --> 02:52.769
We've sunk to a new low. Pizza.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.739
Yeah, if you take off
those mushrooms first.

02:54.830 --> 02:58.610
- Those aren't mushrooms, honey.
- I'll pass.

02:58.709 --> 03:02.820
- Would you nuke that for me?
- Nuke it yourself.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.820
Don't give me that.
You cook for us all the time.

03:09.909 --> 03:13.820
Me barbecue.
Cook outside with flame.

03:13.909 --> 03:16.100
Microwave inside, cook with magic.

03:16.189 --> 03:19.140
flame good, magic bad.

03:19.229 --> 03:21.820
Microwave good, man stupid.

03:23.469 --> 03:27.169
Easy, monkey boy.
fire's our friend.

03:27.269 --> 03:29.259
HeY@

03:30.830 --> 03:33.179
Tim, come on.

03:33.269 --> 03:37.140
You're gonna drip cheese
all over my stove.

03:37.229 --> 03:41.140
Not to mention burn the hair
right off my knuckles. Man.

03:43.310 --> 03:47.979
I'm gonna count to three
and then I'm gonna be up there. One, mo…

03:48.070 --> 03:50.820
Dad. Brad and Randy
are doing bad things.

03:50.909 --> 03:54.530
Unless it involves human sacrifice
I don't want to hear about it.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.459
OK. I'll let you know.

04:00.189 --> 04:02.699
Little baboons.
Where do they learn this stuff?

04:02.790 --> 04:06.140
Possibly from the big baboon.

04:08.429 --> 04:11.459
Yes, you. You encourage
their bad behavior.

04:11.550 --> 04:14.259
- I don't encourage bad behavior.
- Oh, yeah?

04:14.350 --> 04:19.019
Tonight, when Brad spit his chewing gum
across into that plant, you cheered.

04:19.110 --> 04:22.860
Jill, that was a 10.
12-foot arc, easy.

04:24.390 --> 04:28.540
Right into a six-inch pot, man. Michael
Jordan couldn't have made that shot, huh?

04:28.630 --> 04:30.659
- And I did tell him to stop, too.
- Oh, yeah.

04:30.749 --> 04:33.540
after you gave him a standing ovation.

04:33.630 --> 04:36.300
I may be wrong but I think
that's sending a mixed signal.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.449
Enough said.

04:37.550 --> 04:40.110
Now, what are we gonna do
about our boys' table manners?

04:40.189 --> 04:43.140
- You should give a refresher course.
- Me? What about you?

04:43.229 --> 04:46.540
Honey, I'm a man.
What do I know about manners?

04:49.110 --> 04:52.650
I see. So table manners
are the woman's job.

04:52.749 --> 04:55.620
Historically. Jill,
yes, that's the case.

04:55.709 --> 04:58.380
Emily Post. Amy Vanderbilt.

04:58.469 --> 05:02.419
and, of course.
who could forget Miss Manners?

05:02.509 --> 05:08.659
I don't recall an etiquette column
called "Ask Chuck".

05:08.749 --> 05:10.459
"You know. Chuck.
I've been eating pot roast all my life.

05:10.550 --> 05:13.179
get that little gristle piece stuck
in the middle of my tooth."

05:13.269 --> 05:16.890
"Do you suck it out with the tongue
or ask somebody to do it? Help me out."

05:16.989 --> 05:18.050
- Tim…
- "Haul that thing out."

05:18.150 --> 05:20.780
Listen. You are the one
that encouraged their bad behavior.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.100
therefore you should have to be the
one to teach them good behavior.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.620
- We should do this together.
- No, no. You're the transgressor.

05:26.709 --> 05:29.860
I never wear your clothes.

05:32.350 --> 05:34.019
All right. I do like that taffeta gown.

05:34.110 --> 05:36.570
- I feel so pretty.
- You know what I'm talking about.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.380
What do you want me to do?

05:38.469 --> 05:42.419
I want this family get through a meal
without the boys throwing their food.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.419
or gargling their milk
or talking about boogers.

05:45.509 --> 05:49.380
- A meal without boogers.
- Yeah, see? Never gonna happen.

05:49.469 --> 05:51.739
- I can give you a perfect meal.
- Yeah, when?

05:51.830 --> 05:54.580
- When's gonna be this perfect meal?
- Tomorrow night.

05:54.669 --> 05:58.370
Tomorrow night I'll sit the boys down.
We'll have a man-to-manners talk.

05:58.469 --> 06:01.219
You are going to have
three perfect gentlemen.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.870
- Come on. Wow! Look at that!
- Whoa, what was that?

06:03.949 --> 06:06.100
Oh, wow, yeah!

06:06.189 --> 06:10.380
Honey, what is this? What are you…
Where are you going?

06:10.469 --> 06:13.860
Brad and Randy
threw my mattress out the window.

06:13.949 --> 06:16.219
- That's it. I'm coming up there.
- Honey, honey, honey.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.340
you don't have to sleep outside.

06:29.669 --> 06:32.780
So Al and I
have finished that subfloor.

06:36.189 --> 06:40.659
And next time, we'll show you how to lay
tongue-and-groove hardwood flooring.

06:40.749 --> 06:43.540
Al, what size floorboard
are we using on that. Al?

06:43.630 --> 06:46.979
Tim, they're three inches wide
by one eighth of an inch thick.

06:47.070 --> 06:50.380
They'll be fastened down by driving a nail
at a 45-degree angle

06:50.469 --> 06:52.769
- through their longitudinal tongue.
- Oh!

06:52.870 --> 06:55.699
That's gotta hurt, huh?

06:55.790 --> 06:58.620
But we do that to hide
the nail, don't we?

06:58.709 --> 07:01.540
That's right. Tim.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.300
I know that sounds complicated.
but it's not.

07:08.390 --> 07:11.820
And what you'll end up with is
an absolutely beautiful dining-room floor.

07:11.909 --> 07:16.100
Speaking of dining rooms, that brings me
to today's Tool Tip for Too/ Time.

07:16.189 --> 07:20.699
It's about etiquette. It's a big word.
so get out your dictionary.

07:20.790 --> 07:23.659
See, the dining room needs mo things
to be complete.

07:23.749 --> 07:27.140
A floor, and manners.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.900
See, when men are together by ourselves.
we don't worry about manners, do we?

07:29.989 --> 07:31.459
Cos, hey, we don't need 'em.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.580
At the ball game, what's better
than a mustard fight with your buddies.

07:33.669 --> 07:36.019
or spit.., spitting beer?

07:36.110 --> 07:39.650
Hey, buddy. Hey!
Or my personal favorite.

07:39.749 --> 07:44.769
jamming mo big french fries up that nose.
acting like a walrus.

07:44.870 --> 07:45.820
Hey!

07:45.909 --> 07:48.860
It's guy stuff, and women don't appreciate
guy stuff and that's the truth.

07:48.949 --> 07:53.100
I don't think a woman really understands
the diaphragmatic control it takes

07:53.189 --> 07:56.810
to do all of the vowels
in one belch.

08:00.709 --> 08:03.540
A-E-I-O-U.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.259
Manners. Use manners.
It shows you're civilized.

08:08.350 --> 08:11.580
It tells women you're civilized.
and they'll keep doing things for you.

08:11.669 --> 08:14.860
So always remember that.
Use the correct fork.

08:14.949 --> 08:17.249
put the napkin in your lap.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.459
And always -

08:19.550 --> 08:21.659
I do mean always -

08:21.749 --> 08:25.499
excuse yourself
when you lose a little pressure.

08:26.110 --> 08:28.620
Because I want you
to remember, men.

08:28.709 --> 08:32.019
the first three letters of "manners" are…

08:34.110 --> 08:37.140
See you next week.

08:43.229 --> 08:47.780
Look, Tim, I found this broccoli
in Randy's dirty clothes.

08:47.870 --> 08:49.380
Hm.

08:49.469 --> 08:52.659
Either he's hiding it
or not digesting properly.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.860
Oh!

08:53.949 --> 08:57.570
You are so disgusting.
What is all this?

08:57.669 --> 09:00.540
I'm teaching my men some manners.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.939
- With wooden blocks.
- Rehearsal food, that's what that is.

09:04.030 --> 09:06.540
Gee, I hope they don't like it.
I don't have any recipes for wood.

09:06.630 --> 09:10.219
Sure you do. That meat loaf
that you like so much.

09:12.189 --> 09:16.340
I don't mean to criticize, but is this
where you want to put the napkins?

09:16.429 --> 09:19.060
No. I want it in the proper spot.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.179
Let's see. There you go.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.780
- That was right in the first place.
- Hey!

09:26.070 --> 09:28.370
You don't really think
I can do this, do you?

09:28.469 --> 09:29.689
- I didn't say that. Tim.
- Come on.

09:29.790 --> 09:31.820
You don't really think I can do it.
Say the words. Say it. Say it. Say it.

09:31.909 --> 09:36.179
Sweetheart, I just think that you cannot
teach that which you do not know.

09:36.269 --> 09:37.780
- Really?
- Really.

09:37.870 --> 09:43.580
I'll have you know that that which you think
I do not know is that which I know.

09:43.669 --> 09:45.459
No, no, no.

09:45.550 --> 09:48.540
- If I can't whip these boys into shape. I…
- What? What?

09:48.630 --> 09:51.659
- I will give you anything you want.
- Anything?

09:51.749 --> 09:55.100
Anything. I know what you want.

09:57.550 --> 10:00.659
No, no, no. Tim.
That would be the consolation prize.

10:04.469 --> 10:08.979
I was thinking more along the line of
season tickets to the opera.

10:13.269 --> 10:16.810
That's a Greek word, isn't it?
"Death by music."

10:16.909 --> 10:19.469
- You said anything.
- If that's what you want, fine.

10:19.550 --> 10:22.419
But if I want to see
a screaming fat lady with horns.

10:22.510 --> 10:24.809
I'll go to your mom's house. Yeah.

10:29.389 --> 10:31.180
Now, listen, buddy.
A deal is a deal.

10:31.269 --> 10:36.260
I'm gonna call the Michigan
Opera Theater for ticket information.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.429
You're wasting your time.

10:42.519 --> 10:44.750
Mark.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.950
- Mark.
- Yeah. Dad?

10:48.039 --> 10:49.549
Mark?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.629
What are you doing under there.
sweetheart?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.470
Smelling the inside of the trash can.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.990
- Why are you doing that?
- Brad said he'd give me a quarter if I did.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.309
What, is Brad, like.
the garbage fairy now?

11:05.399 --> 11:08.309
- Why don't you go inside and wash up?
- OK.

11:08.399 --> 11:11.710
- Randy. Brad.
- Yeah?

11:11.799 --> 11:14.259
- Home now.
- How goes it, good neighbor?

11:14.360 --> 11:17.190
Hiya. Wilson.
What are you making over there?

11:17.279 --> 11:19.309
Building a porcupine trap.

11:19.399 --> 11:24.629
Really? I don't think there's a whole lot of
porcupine in the Detroit area, are there?

11:24.720 --> 11:27.789
Ah, but if you build it.
they will come.

11:30.279 --> 11:33.149
- What do you want. Dad?
- I want you to go sit down at the table.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.799
- Brad. Can I have a moment with you?
- What?

11:35.879 --> 11:38.870
Your little brother was underneath
that garbage can, smelling it.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.519
Where do you get these ideas?

11:41.600 --> 11:44.029
They just come to me.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.789
Why don't you go sit down?
Let me teach you boys some manners.

11:47.879 --> 11:49.870
- You owe me a quarter.
- No way.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.029
- Dad.
- That's enough. That's enough, you guys.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.269
Cut it out. Stop running around.
Stop, stop. Come here.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.590
- Sit down. We've got work to do. Sit, sit.
- What are we doing?

11:56.679 --> 12:00.379
We're sitting down is what we're doing.

12:00.480 --> 12:05.549
Now. I love you boys, but you are bad
news in the table manners department.

12:05.639 --> 12:08.200
- So we're gonna have a crash course.
- Why?

12:08.279 --> 12:11.590
Why? Because of what happened
in the restaurant last night. That's why.

12:11.679 --> 12:14.190
I told you.
it was that stupid clown's fault.

12:14.279 --> 12:15.750
You ought to go back
and punch him out. Dad.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.350
HeY@

12:17.440 --> 12:21.590
Never hit anybody with makeup -
that's the rule.

12:22.519 --> 12:26.269
Bottom line here, we are gonna
have a civilized meal.

12:26.360 --> 12:30.110
and I set this table nicely.
Put those back.

12:30.200 --> 12:35.669
A civilized meal means. Brad.
no hitting, pinching, kicking.

12:35.759 --> 12:38.590
all that jazz at the table you don't
think l see. I see it. Don't do it.

12:38.679 --> 12:43.190
Randy, none of these gross-out stories.
The boogers, the scab stuff.

12:43.279 --> 12:46.590
- Scabs that talk to boogers…
- Dad, can we talk about food?

12:46.679 --> 12:51.110
Hey. Hey, food. Perfect.
Let's talk food.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.269
OK. Well, today in the cafeteria.
we made Bobby Devers laugh so hard

12:55.360 --> 12:59.139
he shot peas out his nose.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.029
- No way.
- It was excellent.

13:02.120 --> 13:08.220
- Yeah, but did it have snot on it?
- We're not gonna talk snot tonight.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.389
You're gonna come down the stairs
like little princes.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.789
sit down, clean and washed up.
and look around and say:

13:14.879 --> 13:16.429
"Good evening. Mother."

13:16.519 --> 13:18.870
- Mom's not here.
- Pretend she's here.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.710
- I'll be Mommy.
- No, you won't. Don't be Mommy.

13:21.799 --> 13:26.429
That scares me when you say stuff
like that. Have a seat here.

13:26.519 --> 13:28.470
Don't mind me.
Just pretend I'm not here.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.870
It'd be a lot easier to pretend
you weren't here if you weren't.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.309
I won't say a word.
Do you need any help?

13:34.399 --> 13:36.549
Thanks, honey.
but I've got it all taken care of.

13:36.639 --> 13:38.470
Uh-huh. By the way.
I did call Michigan Opera Theater.

13:38.559 --> 13:42.750
There are plenty of good seats available.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.870
You guys gotta help me out. You gotta
help me out. Let's take care of this.

13:45.960 --> 13:51.389
If we don't do this right. I'm gonna
spend the next year at the opera.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.789
All right, focus, focus, focus.
Eating is not just a necessity, it's a job.

14:02.879 --> 14:04.870
And like any job.
you need the proper tools.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.470
These are the tools of the trade.
fork, knife, weaker sister, the spoon.

14:08.559 --> 14:13.070
Help me, help me, help me. Almost
useless, crude instruments by themselves.

14:13.159 --> 14:17.470
But together, they form
the mealtime triad of power.

14:21.639 --> 14:26.350
Tim. I hate to interrupt this gruntfest.
but dinner is less than mo hours away.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.029
- Thanks for reminding me, pookie.
- You're welcome.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.580
Now we've got to hustle up.
We've got to hustle up. Just the ba…

14:32.679 --> 14:35.029
Take the knife out of your mouth, please.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.029
Just the basics, quick. Tonight's dinner.
do not eat with your hands.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.899
Well, what if we're having chicken?

14:44.600 --> 14:49.460
Chicken outdoors - use your hands.
chicken indoors - knife and fork.

14:49.559 --> 14:53.590
- What about live chicken?
- Live chicken?

14:53.679 --> 14:56.059
Brad, who the hell do you hang out with?

14:56.159 --> 14:57.750
- Mom.
- What?

14:57.840 --> 14:59.059
- Dad's cussing.
- I'm not cussing.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.669
- He said a bad word.
- It wasn't bad.

15:00.759 --> 15:04.230
- Yeah, he said "hell" and "damn".
- I did not say "damn".

15:04.320 --> 15:06.830
Now you did.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.110
Control. Control. Control. That's it.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.549
You guys now…

15:19.000 --> 15:22.269
We do exactly as Dad does.
Listen up.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.470
Sit up straight. Sit up straight.
Straight. Sit up straight.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.470
Elbows off the table. Randy.
Randy. Elbows..

15:29.559 --> 15:31.429
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.830
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

15:33.919 --> 15:37.539
- Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.
- Enough, enough, enough.

15:37.639 --> 15:41.029
Stop that, that's enough. Stop that.
that's enough. Stop that, that's enough.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.429
- Don't repeat me.
- Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.

15:44.519 --> 15:49.149
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.389
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.

15:53.600 --> 15:58.070
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.
Stop that, that's enough, don't repeat me.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.750
- Wilson?
- Hiya. Tim.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.190
Looks like you caught your first porcupine.

16:10.279 --> 16:13.309
No, just Mrs Foley's cat.

16:13.399 --> 16:17.549
Easy, fluffy. I'm trying to calm him down
a little bit before I set him loose.

16:17.639 --> 16:19.549
- He's not hurt, is he?
- No, no, no, no. Tim.

16:19.639 --> 16:22.019
This is a humane trap.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.070
Course, that's my opinion, not Fluffy's.

16:29.159 --> 16:32.269
So, how was the powwow with the boys
about their table manners?

16:32.360 --> 16:36.110
Wilson. I don't know. Those kids sit down
to dinner and they go nuts.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.429
Tim. Tim. Tim.
The problem with your boys is

16:38.519 --> 16:41.350
they don't know how to channel
their mealtime aggression.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.629
Mealtime aggression?

16:43.720 --> 16:46.830
See. Tim, primitive man was a hunter.

16:46.919 --> 16:49.070
He had an intimate relationship
with his food.

16:49.159 --> 16:52.389
- Lot of dating with wildebeest going on?
- No, no, no.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.940
I'm talking about a spiritual intimacy.

16:55.039 --> 16:57.419
They were at one with their meat.

16:59.879 --> 17:04.348
The hunter would stalk and kill his prey.
then pay homage to the animal spirit.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.230
He would give thanks to the animal
for giving its life.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.509
But the primitive man in us is confused.

17:09.598 --> 17:14.789
Today our food comes to the table.
We don't know how it got there.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.750
Gives you something to think about
when you open a can of Spam, doesn't it?

17:16.839 --> 17:19.750
Yes, indeedy.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.150
- Thanks. Wilson.
- I think fluffy has calmed down now.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.910
There you go, little buddy, freedom.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.710
Well, with freedom comes responsibility.

17:39.519 --> 17:42.670
- I'm hungry.
- All I wanna do is play.

17:42.759 --> 17:47.190
Enough, enough, enough, guys.
Your mom wants one quiet meal

17:47.279 --> 17:51.910
and I'm gonna give it to her if I have to duct
tape you yard apes to those chairs, quiet.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.869
OK. We'll do whatever you want tonight.
Can we go now?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.789
No, no, you can't go now.
because I'm gonna tell you something.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.029
I know the reason why you guys get nuts
at the dinner table.

18:01.119 --> 18:06.430
Because you don't have
an intimate relationship with your food.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.079
You don't respect what you're eating.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.230
You're not getting this.
Let me show you what I mean. Hm.

18:12.319 --> 18:15.940
This is the chicken
we're having for dinner tonight.

18:16.039 --> 18:18.710
Oh, yuck. That looks gross.

18:18.799 --> 18:21.230
That's exactly my point.

18:21.319 --> 18:24.109
This bird gave its life so you could eat.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.150
You should thank the bird.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.700
Dad, have you lost it?

18:30.680 --> 18:33.589
You're just missing it.
It… You don't get it. It…

18:33.680 --> 18:36.950
It's simple. You guys would lose
your mealtime aggression

18:37.039 --> 18:41.190
if you had to hunt it
and kill it yourselves. Hm.

18:41.279 --> 18:45.059
Tell you what. I'll be the chicken.
you be the mighty hunters.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.509
Stalk, hunt me, kill the chicken.

18:50.559 --> 18:54.630
What a wonderful day
to be a chicken and alive.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.990
Oh. God, it's hunters. I'd better run.

18:58.079 --> 19:00.269
flee. Run, flee.

19:00.359 --> 19:04.109
So they couldn't catch me, flee.
Run. Stalk, hunt, kill me. Run.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.230
- Kill the chicken.
- Kill the chicken.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.460
Kill the chicken. Kill the chicken.

19:22.559 --> 19:26.259
All right. I think the chicken's dead.
The chicken's dead.

19:26.359 --> 19:29.509
But the spirit of the chicken's still alive.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.430
Oh.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.710
We gotta eat this thing now.

19:34.799 --> 19:38.269
I am not eating that.
There's grass all over it.

19:38.359 --> 19:42.349
- Does that bother you?
- Yeah. It's all dirty, gross, disgusting.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.470
Oh, ho, ho.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.789
Haven't we learned something?

19:47.880 --> 19:50.029
You know what?

19:50.119 --> 19:53.029
I think what's dirty
and disgusting and gross

19:53.119 --> 19:56.950
is when you guys come to the table
and tell your booger and scab stories.

19:57.039 --> 19:59.109
fight, kick, yell.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.029
I think manners aren't respect
for your food.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.470
but respect for people around you, maybe.

20:05.559 --> 20:07.390
You guys understand any of this stuff?

20:07.480 --> 20:08.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah, kind of.

20:08.839 --> 20:11.349
Why don't you think about that
before tonight's dinner?

20:11.440 --> 20:14.589
- Now what do we do?
- Whatever you want.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.390
Kill the chicken again.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.150
Randy, honey, do you want
some more mashed potatoes?

20:22.240 --> 20:24.269
- No, thank you.
- How about you. Brad?

20:24.359 --> 20:26.309
No, thank you.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.309
"No, thank you. No, thank you".
That's very polite.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.029
Tim, I gotta apologize.

20:33.119 --> 20:36.660
I thought you couldn't give me one
quiet meal with the boys and you did it.

20:36.759 --> 20:40.029
We can kiss off Madame Butterfly,
can't we?

20:40.119 --> 20:42.710
Not so fast.

20:42.799 --> 20:45.750
You didn't really teach them manners.

20:45.839 --> 20:48.299
You just exhausted them.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.470
Take what you can get.

20:55.279 --> 20:58.230
I might just do that.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.500
I'll be going upstairs now.

21:07.279 --> 21:09.869
You want company?

21:09.960 --> 21:13.269
No. Just you.

21:17.519 --> 21:20.789
- Shouldn't we take the boys to bed?
- Nah. Leave them.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.309
It'll only take a minute anyway.

21:28.759 --> 21:31.470
I'm feeling pretty spry, honey.

21:31.559 --> 21:34.630
Maybe a minute, five, minute, ten.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.029
When laying down that hardwood floor.
you could use a hammer and nails.

21:55.119 --> 21:57.579
But why would you? That'd take forever.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.670
- I think what we need here is…
- More power.

22:01.759 --> 22:04.140
I was thinking right along
those lines myself.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.750
Now. Look what Al
brought us out here.

22:05.839 --> 22:08.750
The Binford 3-11 series B
power nail driver.

22:08.839 --> 22:10.630
- Thank you. Al.
- You're welcome, Tim.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.869
That's etiquette. Always thank your
coworker. Try to say something nice.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.150
Al, good-looking slacks.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.059
That bad boy's raw power.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.589
The kind of power you need to attach
a phone book to a cinder-block wall.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.470
Tim, you might want
to remind our viewers

22:30.559 --> 22:33.190
that the Binford 3-11
has that new safety lock.

22:33.279 --> 22:37.549
- I'm sure it does. Al.
- Well, it's been completely redesigned.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.150
Al, I grew up with these things.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.750
Heck, that is a little different
to what I'm used to seeing, isn't it?

22:42.839 --> 22:45.220
Well, all safeties
are basically a solenoid.

22:45.319 --> 22:49.430
Very impossible to shoot it
when you don't want to shoot it.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.509
Tell you what.
We'll go to a break right now.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.829
- Get me out of this.
- Boy, that's gotta hurt.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.630
Yeah, Al, it does.
Feels kinda like that.
