you wouldn't like it.

I'd love a bowl, Uncle.

Now that your fever is gone,
you seem different somehow.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.130
It's a new day.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.210
We've got a new apartment,
new furniture,

01:23.340 --> 01:26.010

be so happy to see you.

Are you nervous
to meet this Guru?

Not at all.

02:54.930 --> 02:56.640
It's been a difficult
week for me.

02:56.770 --> 02:59.730
My most trusted advisor,
Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents

02:59.810 --> 03:02.270
tried to take control
of Ba Sing Se from me.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.820
It's terrible when you can't trust
the people who are closest to you.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.730
But there is good news.

03:07.860 --> 03:11.490
As we speak, the Council of Five
is meeting to plan an invasion

03:11.610 --> 03:15.870
of The Fire Nation this summer―
On the day of a solar eclipse.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.540
Really?

03:17.660 --> 03:21.250
Now that sounds like
a fascinating and brilliant plan.

03:26.590 --> 03:27.800
General Fong's base

03:27.920 --> 03:30.380
will serve as the launching
point for the attack.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.050
In exactly two months,
the Army and Navy will invade

03:34.180 --> 03:37.140
the Fire Nation
on The Day of Black Sun.

03:37.890 --> 03:40.850
Or we could send in
Momo to do some damage.

the plan.

the note to Appa's horn?

04:23.890 --> 04:25.100
Indeed.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.650
I was a spiritual brother
of your people,

04:27.730 --> 04:30.320
and a personal friend
of Monk Gyatso.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.240
In your note, you said
you could teach me

04:33.360 --> 04:35.320
to gain control
of the Avatar State.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.530
How?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.450
You must gain balance
within yourself

04:39.530 --> 04:42.290
before you can bring
balance to the world.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.790
And the first step to gaining
balance begins with this.

Oh, very sneaky, Toph!

so I can kick both your butts!

You might think you're
the greatest Earthbender

but even you can't bend metal.

We've been presented with
an extraordinary opportunity, girls.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.740
Ha. Ha.

05:58.860 --> 06:03.280
I'm talking about conquering
the whole Earth Kingdom.

06:03.410 --> 06:06.290
For a hundred years
the Fire Nation has hammered away

06:06.370 --> 06:08.920
at Ba Sing Se from the outside.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.630
But now we are on the inside,
and we can take it by ourselves.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.880
Gosh, you're so confident.
I really admire that about you.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.470
From the inside,
we're in the perfect position

06:20.590 --> 06:23.470
to organize a coup
and overthrow the Earth King.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.930
The key is the Dai Li.

06:26.060 --> 06:29.560
Whoever controls the Dai Li,
controls Ba Sing Se.

06:34.570 --> 06:37.240
In order to master the Avatar State,

06:37.360 --> 06:40.150
you must open all the chakras.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.950
Aang, tell me everything
you know about chakras.

06:44.410 --> 06:45.990
What are chakras?

06:46.620 --> 06:48.370
Oh, I see.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.710
I guess we'll start
with the basics.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.590
The water flows
through this creek

06:53.670 --> 06:56.750
much like the energy flows
through your body.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.920
As you see,
there are several pools

06:59.010 --> 07:01.840
where the water swirls
around before flowing on.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.050
These pools are
like our chakras.

07:05.470 --> 07:08.810
So, chakras are pools
of spiraling energy in our bodies?

07:09.060 --> 07:12.440
Exactly. If nothing else were around,

07:12.560 --> 07:15.230
this creek would
flow pure and clear.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.360
However, life is messy,

07:17.440 --> 07:19.440
and things tend
to fall in the creek,

07:19.530 --> 07:21.610
and then what happens?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.200
- The creek can't flow?
- Yes.

07:24.570 --> 07:28.120
But if we open the paths
between the pools...

07:28.200 --> 07:29.830
The energy flows!

07:29.910 --> 07:32.120
( WATER GURGLING )

07:35.420 --> 07:38.210
There are seven chakras
that go up the body.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.630
Each pool of energy
has a purpose,

07:40.720 --> 07:44.260
and can be blocked by a
specific kind of emotional muck.

07:44.680 --> 07:49.220
Be warned― Opening the chakras
is an intense experience,

07:49.350 --> 07:51.270
and once you begin
this process,

07:51.390 --> 07:54.980
you cannot stop until
all seven are open.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.560
Are you ready?

07:58.650 --> 08:00.150
I'll do whatever it takes.

08:00.650 --> 08:03.240
First we will open the Earth chakra,

08:03.360 --> 08:05.490
located at the base
of the spine.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.330
It deals with survival
and is blocked by fear.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.790
<i>What are you most afraid of?</i>

08:13.080 --> 08:15.460
<i>Let your fears
become clear to you.</i>

08:29.350 --> 08:32.680
GURU: <i>Aang, your vision is not real.</i>

08:32.980 --> 08:35.140
You are concerned
for your survival,

08:35.230 --> 08:37.650
but you must surrender
those fears.

08:37.940 --> 08:41.280
Let your fears
flow down the creek.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.570
You have opened
your Earth chakra.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.490
Whew.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.870
( WATER CASCADING )

- Water chakra?

09:00.130 --> 09:01.300
Brilliant!

09:01.380 --> 09:04.010
Maybe one day you
will be a Guru, too.

09:04.920 --> 09:09.720
This chakra deals with pleasure,
and is blocked by guilt.

09:09.930 --> 09:14.480
Now, look at all the guilt
which burdens you so.

09:15.230 --> 09:17.730
What do you blame
yourself for?

09:21.860 --> 09:23.400
AANG: <i>I ran away.</i>

09:34.250 --> 09:35.830
I hurt all of those people.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.290
Accept the reality
that these things happened,

09:40.420 --> 09:44.210
but do not let them cloud
and poison your energy.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.010
If you are to be a positive
influence on the world,

09:48.130 --> 09:50.930
you need to
forgive yourself.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.810
CHIEF HAKODA: This bay leads directly
to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se.

10:00.610 --> 10:02.270
We've been using
these tangle mines

10:02.400 --> 10:05.030
to stop the Fire Nation
ships from getting through.

10:05.570 --> 10:08.530
Your father invented
tangle mines, himself.

( SNIFFING )

10:13.240 --> 10:14.660
( GASPS )

10:15.080 --> 10:16.540
...terrible smelling!

10:16.660 --> 10:17.960
Very perceptive.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.040
The mines are filled with
skunk-fish and seaweed.

10:21.130 --> 10:23.040
When a ship
detonates the mine,

10:23.130 --> 10:25.340
the seaweed tangles
up the propeller,

10:25.420 --> 10:29.340
and the foul smell forces
people to abandon the ship.

10:29.430 --> 10:32.300
I call it
the stink n' sink.

10:32.390 --> 10:35.520
( LAUGHING ) Good one, Dad!

10:35.600 --> 10:37.770
You are definitely
your father's son.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.900
Hakoda, our scouts have
spotted four Fire Nation ships.

10:42.310 --> 10:44.320
Bato, get these mines loaded up.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.860
The rest of you men,
prepare for battle.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.030
Um, what should I do, Dad?

10:51.320 --> 10:52.570
Aren't you listening?

10:52.660 --> 10:55.200
I said the rest of you men
get ready for battle.

11:04.340 --> 11:07.670
Who thought when we came
to this city as refugees,

11:07.800 --> 11:11.180
that I'd end up
owning my own tea shop.

11:11.260 --> 11:15.810
Follow your passion, Zuko,
and life will reward you.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.060
Congratulations, Uncle.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.810
I'm very thankful.

11:20.270 --> 11:21.730
You deserve it.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.610
The Jasmine Dragon will be
the best tea shop in the city.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.940
No, I'm thankful
because you decided

11:28.030 --> 11:30.650
to share this special
day with me.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.320
It means more
than you know.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.120
Now let's make these
people some tea.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.540
Yes, let's make some tea!

11:46.540 --> 11:50.090
Third is the Fire chakra,
located in the stomach.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.760
My Fire chakra would
like to eat something

11:52.840 --> 11:54.340
other than onion-banana juice.

11:54.430 --> 11:55.640
( CHUCKLING )

11:55.720 --> 11:57.680
Good one. Moving on.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.480
This chakra deals with will power
and is blocked by shame.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.190
What are you ashamed of?

12:06.610 --> 12:09.650
<i>What are your biggest
disappointments in yourself?</i>

12:13.910 --> 12:16.070
I'm never gonna firebend again.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.530
I can't.

12:17.660 --> 12:19.450
You will never find balance,

12:19.580 --> 12:22.000
if you deny this part of your life.

12:22.710 --> 12:24.420
You are the Avatar,

12:24.500 --> 12:27.670
and therefore,
you are a Firebender.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.380
( INHALES, EXHALES )

12:33.050 --> 12:36.930
Hmm, that chakra opened
less like a flowing creek,

12:37.010 --> 12:38.430
and more like a...

12:38.720 --> 12:40.140
Burping bison.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.640
( BELCHES )

12:42.390 --> 12:47.020
Tastes like onions and bananas,
but, strangely, something else.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.650
Pickles?

12:49.270 --> 12:50.360
( SHRUGS )

12:55.490 --> 12:58.530
I'm tired of wearing
this girly disguise.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.740
I don't know how anyone
can fight in this.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.410
Maybe that's why
it was so easy

13:02.500 --> 13:05.370
to beat the Kyoshi Warriors
and take their clothes.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.920
How much longer do we have
to serve the Earth King?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.300
If I have to clean up one
more pile of bear poop,

13:11.380 --> 13:12.550
I'm gonna throw up.

13:13.170 --> 13:16.010
Princess Azula promised we
would go back to the Fire Nation

13:16.130 --> 13:18.140
as soon as we captured
the Avatar.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.510
- We just have to be patient.
- Shush up!

13:21.060 --> 13:23.640
Do you want the whole palace
to know we're Fire Nation?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.430
Sorry.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.190
Good work, girls.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.990
I am sure the Dai Li
will deliver the message.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.120
The fourth chakra
is located in the heart.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.210
It deals with love,
and is blocked by grief.

13:48.830 --> 13:51.590
Lay all your grief
out in front of you.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.280
GURU: <i>You have, indeed, felt a great loss.</i>

14:20.410 --> 14:27.250
<i>But love is a form of energy,
and it swirls all around us.</i>

14:27.370 --> 14:31.380
<i>The Air Nomads' love for you
has not left this world.</i>

14:31.500 --> 14:34.380
<i>It is still inside of your heart,</i>

14:34.500 --> 14:38.050
<i>and is reborn in
the form of new love.</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:44.100
Let the pain flow away.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.640
Very good.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.650
Can I have some
onion-banana juice, please?

14:53.810 --> 14:56.820
The fifth in the chain
is the Sound chakra,

14:56.900 --> 14:58.570
located in the throat.

14:59.150 --> 15:03.370
It deals with truth,
and is blocked by lies―

15:03.450 --> 15:05.490
The ones we tell ourselves.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.750
Why didn't you tell
us you were the Avatar?

15:09.370 --> 15:10.790
Because I never wanted to be.

15:11.290 --> 15:14.500
You cannot lie about your own nature.

15:14.630 --> 15:18.130
You must accept that
you are the Avatar.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.220
( INHALING, EXHALING )

15:30.310 --> 15:32.140
Very good, Aang.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.310
You have opened the chakra of Truth.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.740
The sixth pool of energy
is the Light chakra,

15:40.820 --> 15:43.700
located in the center
of the forehead.

15:44.070 --> 15:48.740
It deals with insight
and is blocked by illusion.

15:48.870 --> 15:51.250
The greatest illusion of this world

15:51.370 --> 15:54.170
is the illusion of separation.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.710
Things you think are
separate and different

15:56.790 --> 15:59.460
are actually one
and the same.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.510
AANG: <i>Like the four nations.</i>

16:01.590 --> 16:07.470
GURU: <i>Yes, we are all one people,</i>
<i>but we live as if divided.</i>

16:08.010 --> 16:09.680
We're all connected.

16:09.810 --> 16:11.600
Everything is connected.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.100
That's right.

16:13.230 --> 16:17.520
Even the separation
of the four elements is an illusion.

16:17.650 --> 16:19.230
If you open your mind,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.190
<i>you will see that all
the elements are one―</i>

16:22.280 --> 16:24.910
<i>Four parts of the same whole.</i>

16:24.990 --> 16:27.950
<i>Even metal is just a part of Earth</i>

16:28.080 --> 16:30.910
<i>that has been purified and refined.</i>

16:33.460 --> 16:35.790
( INHALES, EXHALES )

16:38.710 --> 16:42.920
( STRAINING ) Come on metal... Budge.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.180
( METAL THUDS )

16:44.550 --> 16:46.890
Woo! Toph, you rule!

16:51.520 --> 16:52.600
What do you say, Momo?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.770
A cup of tea before
we get back to the king?

16:54.850 --> 16:56.400
( CHATTERING )

16:58.610 --> 16:59.980
Table for two, please.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.280
Uncle, I need two jasmine,
one green and one lychee.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.780
I'm brewing as fast as I can.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.960
AANG: This is the last chakra, isn't it?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.460
GURU: Yes.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.300
Once you open this chakra,

17:23.380 --> 17:27.130
you will be able go in and out
of the Avatar State at will.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.260
And when you are in
the Avatar State,

17:29.350 --> 17:31.180
you will have
complete control

17:31.260 --> 17:34.310
and awareness
of all your actions.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.020
Let's do this.

17:36.140 --> 17:40.360
The Thought chakra is located
at the crown of the head.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.530
It deals with pure cosmic energy

17:43.610 --> 17:46.610
and is blocked by earthly attachment.

17:46.740 --> 17:50.490
Meditate on what attaches
you to this world.

17:56.750 --> 18:01.000
Now, let all of those attachments go.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.800
Let them flow down the river...

18:03.880 --> 18:04.960
Forgotten.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.970
What? Why would I let go of Katara?

18:08.050 --> 18:10.390
I... I love her.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.550
Learn to let her go,

18:12.680 --> 18:15.270
or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy

18:15.390 --> 18:17.690
flow in from the universe.

18:17.810 --> 18:20.440
Why would I choose
cosmic energy over Katara?

18:20.560 --> 18:23.440
How could it be a bad thing that
I feel an attachment to her?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.610
Three chakras ago,
that was a good thing.

18:25.690 --> 18:28.400
You must learn to let go.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.530
( PANTING )

18:32.620 --> 18:34.240
Thank goodness you're here, Suki.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.950
Something terrible
is going on.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.960
The Fire Nation has
infiltrated the city.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.120
I just saw Prince Zuko
and his uncle!

18:40.460 --> 18:42.420
We have to tell
the Earth King right away!

18:42.540 --> 18:46.050
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be sure to let him know.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.090

AZULA: So, Zu Zu's in the city, too.

18:57.810 --> 19:00.640
I think it's time
for a family reunion.

19:01.230 --> 19:02.230
( CHATTERING )

19:02.940 --> 19:05.440
I'm sorry, but I can't
let go of Katara.

19:05.570 --> 19:08.690
Aang, to master the Avatar State,

19:08.820 --> 19:11.950
you must open
all the chakras.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.780
Surrender yourself.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.990
Okay, I'll try.

19:20.910 --> 19:25.670
GURU: <i>Now, think of your attachments</i>
<i>and let them go.</i>

19:25.790 --> 19:29.300
<i>Let the pure cosmic energy flow.</i>

( PANTING )

20:12.420 --> 20:14.430

20:15.640 --> 20:18.180
Katara is in danger!
I have to go!

20:18.310 --> 20:19.890
No, Aang!

20:20.020 --> 20:23.020
By choosing attachment,
you have locked the chakra!

20:23.140 --> 20:27.360
If you leave now, you won't be able
to go into the Avatar State at all!

( METAL CLANGS )

20:40.620 --> 20:42.290
It's another one of her tricks.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.460
There's a giant hole in the box.

20:44.580 --> 20:45.710
How is that a trick?

20:45.830 --> 20:48.710
It's not! It's the real deal!

20:58.390 --> 21:00.810
I am the greatest
Earthbender in the world!

21:00.930 --> 21:03.560
Don't you two dunderheads
ever forget!

21:13.490 --> 21:17.870
I'm going to be stuck in here
forever with you, aren't I?

21:18.410 --> 21:20.620
I have to go to the bathroom.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.200
( METAL CLANGS )

21:23.040 --> 21:25.710
Ready to go knock
some Fire Nation heads?

21:25.790 --> 21:28.170
You don't know how much
this means to me, Dad.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.380
I'll make you proud,

21:29.460 --> 21:32.130
and I'll finally prove to you
what a great warrior I am.

21:32.210 --> 21:35.260
Sokka, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.050
I'm already proud of you,

21:37.180 --> 21:39.640
and I've always known
you were a great warrior.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.140
Really?

21:41.220 --> 21:44.600
Why do you think I trusted you
to look after our tribe when I left?

21:56.360 --> 21:57.740
This can't be good news.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.130
What is this about?

Your agents show up in the middle
of the night and drag me down here?

22:13.550 --> 22:15.800
You will not treat
a Kyoshi Warrior this way!

22:16.090 --> 22:19.510
But you are not
a Kyoshi Warrior, are you,

22:22.140 --> 22:24.890
- What do you want?
- I want to make a deal.

22:24.970 --> 22:28.190
It's time that I regain
control of Ba Sing Se,

something I need.

- The Earth King's trust.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.070
