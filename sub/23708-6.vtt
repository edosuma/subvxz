WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.469
The chilling tale of the man
who wrote the dictionary.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.773
He had been declared
criminally insane.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.878
The quest to solve the puzzle
of the Rosetta Stone.

00:12.947 --> 00:15.113
HARVEY: If you could read this,

00:15.149 --> 00:17.683
you could break the code.

00:17.818 --> 00:21.420
And the catastrophic plane crash
that changed the world.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.622
BOEHM:
They had no real reason why

00:23.757 --> 00:25.657
the aircraft was falling
out of the sky.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.060
Nobody could figure out
what was going on.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.763
These are the mysteries
at the museum.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.237
Alaska's state capital,
Juneau,

00:38.239 --> 00:40.706
is hemmed in on one side
by the rugged,

00:40.708 --> 00:43.575
3,500-foot peak
of Mount Juneau

00:43.677 --> 00:45.844
and on the other
by the icy waters

00:45.846 --> 00:48.280
of the Pacific Ocean --
in fact,

00:48.282 --> 00:50.783
the city is so remote that
most visitors arrive

00:50.918 --> 00:53.318
by cruise ship,
and waiting for them

00:53.320 --> 00:57.122
at the Alaska State Museum is
a host of wondrous treasures.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.261
The institution celebrates
Alaskan history,

01:02.263 --> 01:04.863
including its days
as a Russian territory

01:04.899 --> 01:08.133
before it was purchased
by the United States
in 1867.

01:08.135 --> 01:11.870
On display is a medal awarded
to the last Russian governor

01:11.939 --> 01:15.674
of the territory for his service
during the Crimean War,

01:15.743 --> 01:18.810
an ermine shirt once worn
by an Alaskan native,

01:18.813 --> 01:22.147
and the section of a totem pole
carved in the likeness

01:22.216 --> 01:25.050
of President Abraham Lincoln,

01:25.052 --> 01:27.352
but the artifact that most
embodies the spirit

01:27.421 --> 01:30.622
of the Last Frontier is
this gold relic.

01:30.691 --> 01:34.159
WEATHERFORD:
The artifact is small,
round, and made of metal.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.428
It can fit in your pocket,

01:36.530 --> 01:39.964
and it has numbers on one side,
and on the other side

01:40.000 --> 01:42.668
is an engraving
of a flag with stars.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.573
WILDMAN: This one-of-a-kind
timepiece recalls

01:47.708 --> 01:50.642
a young boy who reached
for the stars.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.312
This watch tells the story
of a boy, a competition,

01:54.381 --> 01:57.149
and an idea that changed
the face of Alaska.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.790
WILDMAN: It's 1926
in Seward, Alaska.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.992
Benny Benson is
a 13-year-old boy who has spent

02:08.028 --> 02:11.196
much of his childhood
in a city orphanage.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.432
His mother had died of
pneumonia, his father was not

02:14.468 --> 02:18.136
able to take care of him --
he was sent to live
in an orphanage.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.340
WILDMAN: Benny spends most of
his days doing schoolwork

02:21.475 --> 02:25.277
or helping out around the home,
but he longs for more.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.479
Benny Benson was very bright

02:27.614 --> 02:30.115
and very creative
and expressive

02:30.117 --> 02:33.552
and really looking
for his place in the world.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.820
WILDMAN: When he's not studying
or doing chores,

02:35.890 --> 02:38.623
Benny seeks solace
in the great outdoors.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.760
He was a Boy Scout
and very curious in nature.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.096
WILDMAN: But one day,
a chance opportunity

02:45.132 --> 02:47.766
in the classroom changes
his life forever.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.435
Benny's teacher announces
that officials are holding

02:50.571 --> 02:54.639
a contest for students to design
the first ever Alaskan flag.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.442
The winner will get
a $1,000 scholarship

02:57.511 --> 02:59.845
and a gold watch
with their winning design

02:59.947 --> 03:01.846
embossed on the back.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.516
Benny's interest is
immediately piqued.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.185
WEATHERFORD:
This was a really
exciting opportunity.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.455
Very few people in history
were really ever given a chance

03:10.524 --> 03:14.526
to be a part of creating
an identify for an entire state.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.794
WILDMAN: So when school ends
for the day,

03:16.830 --> 03:19.264
Benny starts brainstorming.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.200
WEATHERFORD:
Benny's mind was racing,
and he sat down

03:22.336 --> 03:24.603
and started sketching out
all different ideas

03:24.738 --> 03:26.671
that could represent Alaska.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.075
WILDMAN:
First, he designs a flag
with houses and blue waters,

03:30.177 --> 03:33.044
but neither feels particularly
unique to Alaska.

03:33.113 --> 03:37.049
Next, he creates an emblem
featuring local wildlife,

03:37.151 --> 03:39.884
like salmon and bears,
but again,

03:39.954 --> 03:42.554
he feels like these ideas
could represent anywhere

03:42.556 --> 03:44.489
in the Pacific Northwest.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.225
He was getting frustrated,
because nothing really
seemed quite right.

03:47.294 --> 03:50.295
WILDMAN: One evening,

03:50.297 --> 03:53.031
Benny is gazing
into the clear night sky

03:53.067 --> 03:55.767
when he sees
a celestial formation

03:55.836 --> 03:58.203
that is uniquely Alaskan.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.438
WEATHERFORD: The idea hit
like a lightning bolt.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.908
Benny realized that
Alaska was closer

04:03.978 --> 04:06.578
to the Big Dipper than
any other state or territory

04:06.647 --> 04:08.480
in the United States.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.118
WILDMAN: Benny sets about
creating a new design.

04:13.187 --> 04:16.855
At its heart is the instantly
recognizable constellation.

04:16.924 --> 04:20.192
WEATHERFORD: Benny painted
the background midnight blue

04:20.194 --> 04:22.727
like the night sky,
seven little stars

04:22.763 --> 04:25.263
to create the Big Dipper,
and another little star

04:25.265 --> 04:27.699
to serve as the North Star.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.068
WILDMAN: He submits his entry
to the judging panel

04:30.070 --> 04:31.403
and awaits a response.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.675
A few months later,
Benny is in class

04:36.744 --> 04:39.244
when his teacher receives
a telegram.

04:39.246 --> 04:42.747
Out of nearly 700 entries,
Benny's flag design

04:42.783 --> 04:45.316
has been awarded first place.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.819
WEATHERFORD: Benny was
utterly flabbergasted.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.256
He had just designed something
that was going to represent

04:51.258 --> 04:53.892
Alaska for years and years
to come.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.764
WILDMAN: On July 9, 1927,

04:59.833 --> 05:02.567
Benny's flag is flown
in the skies above Alaska

05:02.670 --> 05:04.436
for the first time.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.638
WEATHERFORD: He really became
a hero for the people

05:06.740 --> 05:09.708
of Alaska -- he was the boy
who designed the flag.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.077
WILDMAN: As a prize,
Benny is given

05:12.179 --> 05:14.379
a gold watch featuring
his design

05:14.448 --> 05:17.248
and a $1,000 scholarship.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.251
A thousand dollars in the 1920s

05:19.386 --> 05:22.921
would be the equivalent of
about $15,000 today.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.923
WILDMAN: He puts his winnings
towards engineering school.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.993
And in 1959,

05:29.063 --> 05:31.663
when Alaska becomes
the 49th state,

05:31.798 --> 05:34.332
Benny Benson's design

05:34.368 --> 05:36.802
is declared the official
state flag.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.340
Today, Benny Benson's
prize watch,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.976
featuring his own flag design,
is on display

05:45.045 --> 05:47.479
at the Alaska State Museum
in Juneau.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.748
It recalls the inspiring
young boy

05:49.817 --> 05:53.051
who shot for the stars
and made his dreams come true.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.558
Founded in the 11th century,

06:00.627 --> 06:03.561
England's Oxford University
is the oldest institution

06:03.597 --> 06:05.630
of its kind in the world.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.567
Many of the buildings of
this esteemed seat of learning

06:08.669 --> 06:11.570
are adorned with gargoyles,
some of which are said

06:11.705 --> 06:14.773
to resemble professors who once
worked at the university,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.976
but in one little-known corner
of the campus

06:18.111 --> 06:21.112
is a vast collection
of literary works --

06:21.148 --> 06:23.682
the Oxford University
Press Archives.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.453
On display is

06:28.455 --> 06:31.422
an iron printing press
dating back to 1812,

06:31.492 --> 06:34.459
a bellows camera from 1900,

06:34.461 --> 06:37.796
and a selection of early
20th century,

06:37.865 --> 06:40.331
pocket-sized books that
were once popular

06:40.400 --> 06:42.734
with soldiers stationed
far from home.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.606
But one collection of items
recalls perhaps

06:47.741 --> 06:50.075
one of the most important books
ever written

06:50.077 --> 06:52.210
in the English language.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.646
STOCKTON-DAVIES: The items are
approximately six by nine inches

06:54.781 --> 06:56.914
and four by six inches.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.484
They are made of
aged white paper,

06:59.553 --> 07:02.420
which is filled with
tiny writing in black ink.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.357
The pages each note several
words, such as bloomy,

07:05.459 --> 07:07.725
cropped, or dark.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.929
WILDMAN:
These artifacts connect

07:10.998 --> 07:14.766
two remarkable men
with one incredible obsession.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.836
This is a story about
a professor, a madman,

07:17.838 --> 07:19.871
and their love of words.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.643
WILDMAN: It's 1888
in Oxford, England.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.847
After nine years
of meticulous work,

07:28.916 --> 07:31.316
a compilation
of the first volume

07:31.318 --> 07:33.384
of the Oxford English Dictionary

07:33.420 --> 07:37.388
has finally been completed --
it's been an epic undertaking.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.792
The first volume of
the dictionary was

07:40.794 --> 07:44.129
352 pages already,
and that was only covering

07:44.131 --> 07:46.164
the words A to Ant.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.733
WILDMAN: The man behind
the effort is a former

07:48.802 --> 07:51.202
grammar school teacher
named James Murray.

07:51.205 --> 07:54.071
STOCKTON-DAVIES: People really
saw him as a great scholar

07:54.107 --> 07:57.809
because of his love of
languages and his ease

07:57.944 --> 08:01.512
and ability to teach other
people his passion.

08:01.582 --> 08:05.016
WILDMAN: Unlike earlier
dictionaries, Murray's version

08:05.052 --> 08:08.353
does much more than merely
define the meaning of words.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.156
STOCKTON-DAVIES:
One of the ideas behind
the Oxford English Dictionary

08:12.226 --> 08:14.960
was that it would surpass
other dictionaries.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.362
It not only would have
the definition of the words

08:17.431 --> 08:19.831
but also how they came
into usage.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.902
WILDMAN:
But Murray can't claim total
credit for the accomplishment.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.038
Early in the process,
he had taken the unusual step

08:27.173 --> 08:30.909
of soliciting the general public
for ideas for words and phrases

08:31.044 --> 08:33.844
to include in the iconic tome.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.682
Murray's appeal asked people
to look through the books

08:37.718 --> 08:39.818
and the magazines
that they owned,

08:39.953 --> 08:43.388
to select interesting sentences
and provide Murray

08:43.523 --> 08:46.258
with the name of the book,
the page number the sentence
was on,

08:46.393 --> 08:48.627
and how it was used
in the context.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.664
WILDMAN: Those interested
in helping would send Murray

08:52.733 --> 08:56.000
special index pages listing
words and their meanings,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.036
origin, and usage.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.472
A selection of
these unique word lists

09:00.607 --> 09:04.208
is now on display at the Oxford
University Press Archives.

09:04.278 --> 09:07.879
In the end, the public's help
is invaluable to the success

09:07.948 --> 09:10.548
of the project,
but one correspondent

09:10.684 --> 09:12.484
stands apart.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.821
STOCKTON-DAVIES: There was
one person in particular

09:16.957 --> 09:19.958
who had been sending him
not just a few quotations

09:20.027 --> 09:22.093
but thousands.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.696
WILDMAN: This stream of
contributions is from

09:24.831 --> 09:27.966
a man by the name of
Dr. W. C. Minor.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.435
And over the course
of the collaboration,

09:31.471 --> 09:34.239
Murray and Dr. Minor
have a special bond.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.707
STOCKTON-DAVIES:
Eventually, Minor and Murray

09:36.743 --> 09:38.776
began including
personal details

09:38.911 --> 09:41.179
in their correspondence
to one another.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.114
WILDMAN: Now, with the first
volume of the dictionary

09:43.249 --> 09:45.784
complete, Murray is curious
to meet his prolific

09:45.919 --> 09:47.919
pen pal in person.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.057
Murray would ask again
and again for the opportunity

09:53.126 --> 09:55.326
to meet Minor,
and every time Murray asked,

09:55.362 --> 09:57.162
Minor would say no.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.465
WILDMAN: So as the story goes,
in the autumn of 1896,

10:00.534 --> 10:03.468
Murray decides to pay a visit
to Dr. Minor

10:03.470 --> 10:06.071
at the return address written
on his letters,

10:06.206 --> 10:09.440
which Murray assumes is
Dr. Minor's place of work,

10:09.509 --> 10:13.078
an institution named
the Broadmoor Criminal
Lunatic Asylum.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.349
STOCKTON-DAVIES:
Murray must have been
excited and anxious

10:18.385 --> 10:20.551
to meet Dr. Minor.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.288
This person was still
an elusive and vague figure.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.024
WILDMAN: But as Murray is
escorted down a hallway,

10:27.060 --> 10:30.528
it dawns on him that
he's not being taken
to a doctor's office.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.898
Instead, he's being led
to a locked room.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.101
Dr. Minor doesn't work
at the asylum.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.437
He's a patient.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.106
STOCKTON-DAVIES:
He realized that he had
received thousands of

10:42.175 --> 10:45.109
entries for his dictionary
sent to him by a man

10:45.178 --> 10:48.513
who'd been legally declared
criminally insane.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.838
It's 1896 in Berkshire, England.

10:57.874 --> 11:01.209
Scholar James Murray has spent
almost a decade

11:01.278 --> 11:04.712
compiling the first volume of
the Oxford English Dictionary.

11:04.781 --> 11:07.549
To help with this massive
undertaking, he solicited

11:07.651 --> 11:10.051
submissions
from the general public.

11:10.153 --> 11:13.521
One man, Dr. William Minor,
has been particularly prolific,

11:13.590 --> 11:17.492
but this willing wordsmith
harbors a shocking secret.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.629
Dr. Minor is a patient
in a hospital

11:21.765 --> 11:23.831
for the criminally insane.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.833
After a decade of
correspondence,

11:25.902 --> 11:28.569
Murray and Dr. Minor are
finally face to face.

11:28.605 --> 11:32.373
Then, Dr. Minor begins to tell
his astonishing story.

11:32.376 --> 11:35.243
It goes back to the days
when the doctor served

11:35.378 --> 11:37.812
as a surgeon
in the American Civil War.

11:37.881 --> 11:40.648
STOCKTON-DAVIES: Minor explained
to Professor Murray that

11:40.717 --> 11:43.551
the horrific sights
he dealt with during the war

11:43.653 --> 11:47.455
eventually led to him being
diagnosed with paranoia.

11:47.524 --> 11:49.890
WILDMAN: After the war,
Minor moved to England

11:49.926 --> 11:52.260
with hopes of easing
his mental suffering,

11:52.329 --> 11:55.296
but in the midst of an episode
of extreme paranoia...

11:55.365 --> 11:57.866
Minor shot and killed a man.

12:02.205 --> 12:03.804
Rather than sentence him
to death,

12:03.840 --> 12:06.541
the British courts sent him
to Broadmoor Asylum,

12:06.543 --> 12:08.910
where he lived a life
of relative comfort.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.613
STOCKTON-DAVIES:
He was given a two-room suite,

12:11.615 --> 12:13.615
and most importantly,
he was allowed

12:13.750 --> 12:16.317
his prized possessions,
his books.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.853
WILDMAN: When Dr. Minor saw
Murray's appeal,

12:18.988 --> 12:21.289
it gave him a renewed
sense of purpose.

12:21.424 --> 12:23.024
By helping create
this dictionary,

12:23.093 --> 12:25.827
he feels like
he's contributing to society.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.296
WILDMAN: Despite
the unusual circumstances,

12:28.298 --> 12:30.698
the pair maintains
their correspondence,

12:30.767 --> 12:33.901
and Minor continues to supply
words and definitions

12:33.970 --> 12:36.404
for the remaining volumes
of the dictionary.

12:38.775 --> 12:41.442
In 1928, after 70 years of work,

12:41.511 --> 12:43.978
the completed
Oxford English Dictionary

12:44.014 --> 12:45.980
is finally published.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.316
It spans ten volumes
and defines

12:48.418 --> 12:51.452
414,800 words,

12:51.521 --> 12:54.122
some 10,000 of which
were contributed

12:54.257 --> 12:56.524
by Dr. W. C. Minor.

12:56.659 --> 12:59.527
It's strange to think
that this unlikely friendship

12:59.563 --> 13:02.663
150 years ago would help
to create

13:02.732 --> 13:05.567
such a foundation piece
of the English language.

13:09.606 --> 13:12.607
WILDMAN: Today, these index
pages submitted to Dr. Murray

13:12.609 --> 13:15.410
noting a series of words
and their meanings

13:15.412 --> 13:18.078
are on display
at the Oxford University

13:18.114 --> 13:20.482
Press Archives in England.

13:20.617 --> 13:23.718
They recall a semantic alliance
that redefined the dictionary.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.289
Chicago, Illinois,
is the site

13:28.391 --> 13:30.859
of the world's first skyscraper.

13:30.961 --> 13:33.561
In 1885,
the Home Insurance Building

13:33.663 --> 13:36.831
reached the unprecedented
height of nine stories

13:36.833 --> 13:39.667
thanks to the development
of the hydraulic elevator.

13:39.802 --> 13:42.903
Today, the city plays host
to four of the ten

13:42.939 --> 13:45.472
tallest structures
in the U.S.,

13:45.509 --> 13:48.042
and in the shadow of
these architectural giants

13:48.078 --> 13:50.778
is an institution
no less impressive --

13:50.847 --> 13:53.348
the Chicago Public Library.

13:55.986 --> 13:58.786
On display is a souvenir
popup book

13:58.855 --> 14:01.656
celebrating
the 1893 World's Fair,

14:01.791 --> 14:05.126
a first edition copy of
<i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:07.561
dating back to 1900,

14:07.597 --> 14:11.299
and watercolor designs of
Actor John Malkovich's costumes

14:11.301 --> 14:14.602
from a 1996 stage production.

14:14.638 --> 14:16.905
But among these artifacts

14:17.007 --> 14:19.007
from the creative sphere
is one

14:19.142 --> 14:21.242
that is distinctly utilitarian.

14:21.344 --> 14:24.012
COSTELLO: The artifact is
approximately two feet wide

14:24.114 --> 14:27.282
by three feet long.
It is made of paper.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.851
It's been creased, torn,
and yellowed with age.

14:32.222 --> 14:34.355
WILDMAN: This map recalls
the incredible tale

14:34.357 --> 14:37.191
of how an iconic city
literally rose up

14:37.193 --> 14:39.794
in the face
of an impossible challenge.

14:39.896 --> 14:42.697
COSTELLO: This is a story
about a foul problem,
a clever engineer,

14:42.832 --> 14:45.567
and his especially lofty goal.

14:49.906 --> 14:52.173
WILDMAN: It's the early 1850s.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.109
Railroads are changing the face
of American cities,

14:55.178 --> 14:57.512
none more so than Chicago.

14:57.514 --> 14:59.647
Over a period
of just five years,

14:59.716 --> 15:02.016
the population
has nearly doubled.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.720
This era of rapid expansion also
brings a new set of challenges.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.390
COSTELLO: Chicago, initially,
wasn't designed

15:09.459 --> 15:12.059
for such a population increase,

15:12.128 --> 15:14.995
and the infrastructure was
starting to crumble.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.598
WILDMAN: The city is built
on a flat stretch

15:17.667 --> 15:20.267
of swampland on the edge
of Lake Michigan.

15:20.303 --> 15:23.671
In fact, the city
and the lake are almost
at identical elevations,

15:23.740 --> 15:26.340
and this is the heart
of the problem.

15:26.409 --> 15:29.344
The topography of Chicago
wasn't designed

15:29.479 --> 15:31.946
to allow a lot of drainage.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.214
WILDMAN:
The streets themselves overflow

15:34.250 --> 15:37.084
with stinking human excrement
and putrid manure

15:37.153 --> 15:39.353
from the area's carriage horses.

15:39.422 --> 15:42.356
COSTELLO: The roads turned
into basically these washes

15:42.425 --> 15:45.092
of toxic mud
that was breathing germs,

15:45.128 --> 15:48.162
it was really creating
an unhealthy environment.

15:48.231 --> 15:52.233
WILDMAN: But in the summer
of 1854,

15:52.302 --> 15:54.935
the situation gets
even worse.

15:55.005 --> 15:58.106
A deadly outbreak of cholera
spreads across

15:58.108 --> 16:00.908
the Windy City, killing
more than five percent

16:00.910 --> 16:02.877
of the city's population.

16:02.946 --> 16:05.513
Many doctors suspect
the epidemic may be linked

16:05.515 --> 16:08.149
to the city's dirty
drinking water.

16:08.151 --> 16:10.651
Chicago officials
realized that

16:10.654 --> 16:13.588
as this crisis grew,
they would have to find

16:13.590 --> 16:15.890
some way to solve that problem.

16:15.959 --> 16:19.060
WILDMAN: At first,

16:19.129 --> 16:21.628
city engineers add
a downward slope

16:21.665 --> 16:24.332
to the streets in an attempt
to help the wastewater

16:24.467 --> 16:27.201
drain into the lake,
but it doesn't work.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.269
COSTELLO: They could never get
the grade

16:29.305 --> 16:31.739
at the proper level to allow
that to happen.

16:31.775 --> 16:34.609
WILDMAN: Next, they try
covering the streets

16:34.711 --> 16:37.478
with wooden planks so people
will not be in direct

16:37.547 --> 16:39.714
contact with the dirty water.

16:39.816 --> 16:41.882
The wood started to rot,
and that water just

16:41.951 --> 16:43.984
started to seep up --
at this point,

16:44.020 --> 16:46.354
city officials were desperate,
trying to come up with

16:46.489 --> 16:48.523
a solution of
their growing city.

16:51.161 --> 16:53.294
WILDMAN: In February of 1855,

16:53.363 --> 16:55.963
with the situation showing
no sign of improving,

16:56.032 --> 16:58.232
the government turns to
an engineer named

16:58.367 --> 17:00.200
Ellis Chesbrough.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.503
Chesbrough got his start
as a railway surveyor

17:02.539 --> 17:05.306
and moved his way up the ranks
to be in charge

17:05.375 --> 17:08.176
of completely overhauling
Boston's waterworks.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.845
Chesbrough seemed like
a very innovative man

17:10.847 --> 17:13.047
and one who wasn't going
to shy away

17:13.182 --> 17:15.116
from a massive problem.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.452
WILDMAN: His first thought

17:17.587 --> 17:20.087
is to create an underground
sewer system to carry

17:20.123 --> 17:22.723
wastewater away from the city
and into the lake.

17:22.759 --> 17:25.126
But this proves problematic.

17:25.195 --> 17:27.428
Because of the city's flatness,

17:27.563 --> 17:30.865
the sewer system would be
below the lake's elevation.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.735
WILDMAN: Without gravity
draining it from the city,

17:33.837 --> 17:36.871
wastewater would have to be
pumped into the lake.

17:36.940 --> 17:40.007
This plan ultimately ended up
being too elaborate,

17:40.009 --> 17:42.276
too difficult,
and too expensive.

17:45.615 --> 17:47.849
WILDMAN:
But Chesbrough is undaunted.

17:47.951 --> 17:50.618
COSTELLO: An entire city's
health was on the line.

17:50.687 --> 17:53.955
Chesbrough was about to come up
with an exceptionally

17:53.957 --> 17:55.956
lofty idea.

17:56.025 --> 17:58.559
WILDMAN: Chesbrough concludes
that if he cannot dig down,

17:58.694 --> 18:01.863
then he'll have to lift
the entire city up.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.986
It's the 1850s
in Chicago, Illinois.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.423
The city is in the grips of
a deadly cholera epidemic

18:12.558 --> 18:15.259
but one man, an engineer

18:15.328 --> 18:17.628
named Ellis Chesbrough,
has come up

18:17.630 --> 18:19.997
with an incredible way
to cure the problem.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.102
The engineer decides the key

18:25.138 --> 18:28.038
to solving the problem is
something called a jackscrew.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.641
COSTELLO: A jackscrew is
essentially a carjack,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.510
a metal tool that is used
to lift heavy weights

18:33.546 --> 18:35.346
incrementally.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.515
Chesbrough had seen them
lifting locomotives.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.885
WILDMAN: If jackscrews
can lift trains,

18:41.921 --> 18:43.988
perhaps they can be used
to lift buildings.

18:44.057 --> 18:48.059
Chesbrough presents his bold
plan to Chicago leaders,

18:48.061 --> 18:50.227
who agree to give it a try.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.829
This was one of
the most ambitious

18:51.964 --> 18:54.198
engineering projects
of the 19th century.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.103
WILDMAN: In January of 1858,

18:59.172 --> 19:01.639
workers gather to raise
the first building.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.108
COSTELLO: It was
a brick-constructed building,

19:04.243 --> 19:07.645
and it was about 750 tons.

19:07.714 --> 19:11.248
WILDMAN: 200 jackscrews are
placed around the perimeter

19:11.317 --> 19:14.385
of the four-story structure --
then, the team of workers

19:14.454 --> 19:16.721
turns the jacks in unison.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.858
COSTELLO: They raise
the building bit by bit,

19:20.927 --> 19:23.527
until it was about a height
of six feet.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.364
Then, beneath that building,
they put the sewer lines in

19:26.499 --> 19:29.600
and basically rebuilt
its infrastructure.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.002
WILDMAN: After the first
building is lifted,

19:32.038 --> 19:35.339
the ambitious plan is deemed
successful enough to continue.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.477
Chesbrough must have felt
exhilarated to see

19:40.513 --> 19:43.681
this building lift up
and to see his plan work.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.684
WILDMAN: It takes nearly
two decades to lift

19:46.819 --> 19:49.754
all of the necessary buildings
to their new positions.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.290
Eventually, the entire city
is elevated

19:52.392 --> 19:54.758
between four and 14 feet.

19:54.827 --> 19:58.162
And this incredible
accomplishment of engineering

19:58.297 --> 20:01.499
allows the city's
pestilent sewage to flow

20:01.634 --> 20:04.568
away from the densely-packed
streets and into the lake.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.371
COSTELLO: The waterlogged
streets of Chicago started

20:07.407 --> 20:10.440
to disappear,
and as that diseased water

20:10.476 --> 20:13.044
diminished and the threat
of cholera diminished,

20:13.046 --> 20:15.313
health in the city
really improved.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.985
WILDMAN: Today,
this map of the city's

20:21.120 --> 20:23.353
revolutionary sewer system
is housed

20:23.355 --> 20:25.723
in the collection of
the Chicago Public Library.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.193
It recalls a foul problem
and the man who took a city

20:29.262 --> 20:31.228
to new heights.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.734
The California cities of
Coronado and San Diego

20:36.869 --> 20:39.403
are connected by
a two-mile-long bridge.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.472
It curves along
the San Diego Bay
at an astonishing

20:42.508 --> 20:45.743
90-degree angle
and a height of 200 feet.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.412
And not far from
this massive span

20:48.481 --> 20:51.749
is an institution dedicated
to preserving the written word,

20:51.818 --> 20:55.353
the Rare Book Room at
the San Diego Central Library.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.492
The collection includes
a set of miniature books

21:01.561 --> 21:05.162
so small, a magnifying glass
is required to read them,

21:05.297 --> 21:08.832
an early 17th-century
music manuscript

21:08.901 --> 21:12.169
printed on parchment
made from animal hide,

21:12.238 --> 21:15.172
and a lacquered palm leaf
from Burma

21:15.307 --> 21:17.508
inscribed by Buddhist monks.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.447
Among these literary treasures

21:23.582 --> 21:26.417
is an item that contains
a thousand-year-old mystery.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.955
The object is 26-and-a-half
inches wide

21:31.057 --> 21:33.257
and 34 inches high.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.060
It has a strange
and distinctive shape,

21:36.129 --> 21:39.497
and it has some unusual
writing and symbols on it.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.069
WILDMAN: This engraved tablet
holds the key

21:45.138 --> 21:47.805
to one of the greatest secrets
of the ancient world.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.574
A stone like this one
was used to unlock

21:50.710 --> 21:52.743
a long-lost language.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.349
WILDMAN:
It's the 1790s in Egypt.

21:58.351 --> 22:01.419
A remarkable series of
archeological discoveries

22:01.521 --> 22:03.787
of temples and tombs
across the region

22:03.856 --> 22:06.623
has led to a newfound
fascination with the pharaohs

22:06.693 --> 22:08.592
and their people.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.961
There was a lot of interest
in trying to understand

22:11.030 --> 22:14.432
the entire history
of ancient Egypt.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.503
WILDMAN: But as scholars
and historians pore over

22:19.572 --> 22:22.239
these aged relics,
they face a seemingly

22:22.241 --> 22:24.441
insurmountable problem.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.244
The ancient Egyptians used
an indecipherable form

22:27.379 --> 22:30.014
of pictorial writing
known as hieroglyphs.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.652
HARVEY: Some people thought
it was an alphabet,

22:34.654 --> 22:36.987
like we use -- some people
thought it was just

22:37.123 --> 22:39.123
symbolic writing.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.025
WILDMAN: Despite the best
efforts of Europe's

22:41.027 --> 22:43.260
most eminent scholars,
the hieroglyphs

22:43.296 --> 22:45.529
remain an enigma.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.232
It's hard to even
over-emphasize

22:48.367 --> 22:51.802
how much information
was closed off to us

22:51.838 --> 22:54.405
about ancient Egypt
because no one could

22:54.540 --> 22:56.340
read the hieroglyphs.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.642
It's the only way to read
the Egyptians' own story

22:58.745 --> 23:00.411
in their own words.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.682
WILDMAN: But then, in 1798,

23:05.752 --> 23:07.751
something happens that changes
the way we see

23:07.820 --> 23:09.753
the ancient world forever.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.489
The French Emperor,
Napoleon Bonaparte

23:12.525 --> 23:14.525
invades Egypt.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.627
Along with his army,
he brings a host

23:16.762 --> 23:19.563
of scientists and historians
determined to uncover

23:19.599 --> 23:22.365
the secrets of this lost
civilization.

23:22.401 --> 23:26.102
Suddenly, the world of ancient
Egyptian culture opened up
to scholars.

23:26.139 --> 23:30.040
WILDMAN: Then, in July 1799

23:30.076 --> 23:33.210
near the town of Rosetta,
a group of French soldiers

23:33.312 --> 23:35.846
are rebuilding an old fort
when one of them

23:35.882 --> 23:38.048
comes across something
extraordinary --

23:38.050 --> 23:41.085
a black stone slab.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.521
After the soldiers dust it off,

23:43.623 --> 23:46.991
they find a bizarre inscription
chiseled onto its face,

23:46.993 --> 23:50.728
apparently in three
distinct languages.

23:50.830 --> 23:54.765
It had three different scripts,

23:54.834 --> 23:57.868
Greek, Demotic,

23:58.003 --> 24:00.370
and hieroglyphs.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.174
WILDMAN: At the time, Ancient
Greek is understood by many,

24:03.276 --> 24:06.476
while Demotic is a more modern
form of the Egyptian language.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.880
The hieroglyphs, however,
are still a mystery.

24:09.916 --> 24:13.050
Experts waste no time

24:13.052 --> 24:15.218
in translating the Greek text.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.955
HARVEY:
It's a decree published

24:17.957 --> 24:20.190
in 196 B.C.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.893
telling the priests throughout
Egypt that they're meant

24:23.028 --> 24:24.995
to worship this king.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.063
WILDMAN: But it's one claim
on the stone that garners

24:27.099 --> 24:29.033
the most attention.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.168
The text states that all three
inscriptions contain

24:32.205 --> 24:34.638
the same message,
and this has

24:34.707 --> 24:36.940
an incredible implication.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.343
HARVEY: If you could read
this Greek

24:39.412 --> 24:42.846
and figure out how to correspond
it to the mysterious

24:42.882 --> 24:45.081
picture writing of
the Ancient Egyptians,

24:45.117 --> 24:47.318
you could break the code.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.386
WILDMAN: So how will
these cryptic carvings

24:49.422 --> 24:51.255
finally be revealed?

24:56.045 --> 24:59.079
It's 1799
in Rosetta, Egypt.

24:59.181 --> 25:03.049
In this age of great discovery,
archeologists have unearthed

25:03.085 --> 25:05.686
countless treasures,
but one aspect

25:05.755 --> 25:08.122
of Ancient Egypt
remains a mystery --

25:08.224 --> 25:10.957
the language of the pharaohs,
hieroglyphs.

25:10.993 --> 25:14.528
But when a French soldier
uncovers a strange tablet,

25:14.530 --> 25:16.964
it might just hold the key.

25:16.966 --> 25:18.966
So how will this cryptic stone

25:19.101 --> 25:22.035
unlock the stories
of the ancients?

25:22.071 --> 25:25.339
When news of the Rosetta Stone's
discovery gets out,

25:25.341 --> 25:28.241
the race to translate
the hieroglyphs is on.

25:28.311 --> 25:31.712
Copies of the stone are
produced and widely circulated,

25:31.781 --> 25:34.515
but the task at hand
is not an easy one.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.786
HARVEY: There was such
complexity to the issue.

25:39.822 --> 25:42.990
It was not a simple matter
of breaking a code

25:42.992 --> 25:45.459
with an alphabetic language
like ours.

25:45.528 --> 25:47.261
WILDMAN:
For more than 20 years,

25:47.363 --> 25:49.463
scholars, archeologists,
and scientists

25:49.532 --> 25:52.066
try to determine
if each symbol

25:52.201 --> 25:54.668
represents a word, a letter,
or an idea,

25:54.737 --> 25:56.804
but all in vain.

25:56.906 --> 26:00.140
The secret of the hieroglyphs
seemed impossible to discover.

26:00.209 --> 26:03.276
WILDMAN: Then, in 1822,

26:03.346 --> 26:06.013
a 32-year-old French
academic named

26:06.015 --> 26:08.148
Jean-Francois Champollion

26:08.150 --> 26:10.650
decides to try
and crack the code.

26:10.686 --> 26:13.153
HARVEY: Jean-Francois
Champollion was a child genius,

26:13.189 --> 26:15.823
and he was absolutely

26:15.958 --> 26:18.492
passionate about Ancient Egypt.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.695
WILDMAN: Champollion studies
the stone and sees

26:21.731 --> 26:25.499
one particular symbol,
a circle with a black
dot inside,

26:25.568 --> 26:29.069
that he thinks could mean
the sun, or the word Ra.

26:29.204 --> 26:32.172
From this, he draws
a stunning conclusion.

26:32.274 --> 26:35.442
He could recognize
the name Rameses.

26:39.782 --> 26:42.116
WILDMAN: Champollion realizes
the hieroglyphs are not

26:42.118 --> 26:46.120
letters, words, or ideas --
they are a blend of all three.

26:46.222 --> 26:49.656
HARVEY: He realized that
there was a combination of

26:49.725 --> 26:52.593
many different kinds of signs
that had to be understood

26:52.595 --> 26:54.861
together,
almost like a clockwork,

26:54.930 --> 26:57.531
in order to understand
how the whole system worked.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.734
WILDMAN: From there,
Champollion unravels

27:00.803 --> 27:03.604
more and more of the secret
language until finally,

27:03.739 --> 27:06.273
he deciphers its meaning.

27:06.342 --> 27:09.876
He cried out in his study,

27:09.912 --> 27:13.280
"I've got it!"
And then he collapsed

27:13.382 --> 27:15.949
in a faint for apparently
five days.

27:15.951 --> 27:19.686
WILDMAN: When Champollion
publishes his explanation

27:19.689 --> 27:22.623
of the hieroglyphics,
his work sends shockwaves

27:22.758 --> 27:24.958
throughout the academic world.

27:25.094 --> 27:27.494
In the years that follow,
countless Egyptian texts

27:27.563 --> 27:31.231
are translated,
revealing much about
the long-lost ancient world,

27:31.333 --> 27:33.967
including lists of
the ruling pharaohs,

27:34.103 --> 27:36.303
their rituals of death,
and a window

27:36.305 --> 27:39.106
into daily life
from thousands of years ago.

27:39.175 --> 27:43.177
HARVEY:
Champollion's decipherment
allowed the entire

27:43.179 --> 27:46.447
history of Egypt to be
opened to the world.

27:50.119 --> 27:52.719
WILDMAN: Today, a replica
of the Rosetta Stone

27:52.788 --> 27:55.589
is on display at the San Diego
Central Library's

27:55.591 --> 27:57.524
Rare Book Room.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.627
It recalls the epic quest
to unlock the mysteries

28:00.629 --> 28:02.629
of Ancient Egypt.

28:06.235 --> 28:08.135
New York City.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.204
The famed Madison Square Garden

28:10.339 --> 28:13.473
has sat atop Penn Station
since 1968.

28:13.542 --> 28:17.076
This 20,000-seat arena
is designed to convert

28:17.113 --> 28:20.480
from an ice rink
to a basketball court

28:20.549 --> 28:23.750
to a concert venue,
all in a matter of hours.

28:23.753 --> 28:26.220
And not far away
is an institution

28:26.355 --> 28:29.289
dedicated to entertainments
of a different sort --

28:29.391 --> 28:32.326
the New York Public Library
for the Performing Arts.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.097
The collection includes

28:38.134 --> 28:41.034
a bust of 18th-century
composer,

28:41.070 --> 28:43.036
Ludwig van Beethoven,

28:43.172 --> 28:45.639
an ornately painted
vinyl record

28:45.641 --> 28:47.207
of a French opera,

28:47.342 --> 28:49.376
and a model of the set
from the revival

28:49.378 --> 28:51.845
of the Broadway musical,
<i>Carousel</i> .

28:51.914 --> 28:55.849
But among
these cultural mementos

28:55.918 --> 28:58.118
is one object that tells

28:58.253 --> 29:00.921
a dark and sinister tale.

29:01.056 --> 29:03.991
This artifact dates
from the 1930s.

29:04.126 --> 29:07.461
There's black text printed
on the aged paper.

29:07.596 --> 29:10.397
It features an image of
a mustachioed man

29:10.499 --> 29:12.733
and a detailed
description of him.

29:15.304 --> 29:18.806
WILDMAN: This newspaper article
recounts the captivating case

29:18.908 --> 29:21.474
of a mysterious
missing billionaire.

29:21.544 --> 29:24.778
This investigation was
one of the biggest in history.

29:28.918 --> 29:30.951
WILDMAN: It's December 1919

29:31.086 --> 29:33.053
in Toronto, Canada.
[ Phone rings ]

29:33.122 --> 29:35.055
Toronto police get a call.

29:35.124 --> 29:37.958
On the line is a woman who says
her husband is missing.

29:38.027 --> 29:41.027
He is Canada's leading
theater impresario,

29:41.096 --> 29:43.964
a man named Ambrose Small.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.633
HOFF: Ambrose Small
was the owner of

29:46.702 --> 29:48.869
the Grand Opera House
in Toronto,

29:48.938 --> 29:51.371
and small was a pretty
accurate name for him.

29:51.407 --> 29:54.173
He was only about five-foot,
six inches tall

29:54.210 --> 29:56.610
and just over 135 pounds.

29:59.281 --> 30:01.581
WILDMAN: Small's wife, Theresa,
goes on to explain

30:01.650 --> 30:04.117
that her husband is
a serial philanderer.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.520
He is frequently
away for days,

30:06.522 --> 30:09.723
and the last time she saw him
was some two weeks earlier.

30:09.792 --> 30:12.593
His wife didn't initially
report him gone,

30:12.728 --> 30:15.462
believing that he was
probably with another woman

30:15.531 --> 30:17.931
and would come home
eventually.

30:20.135 --> 30:21.802
WILDMAN: But there's
something odd about

30:21.937 --> 30:23.937
the circumstances of
his disappearance

30:23.973 --> 30:26.105
that arouses suspicions.

30:26.141 --> 30:27.641
The call ends,

30:27.743 --> 30:29.876
and police begin to gather
information on the case,

30:29.945 --> 30:32.613
starting with
Theresa Small herself.

30:32.748 --> 30:36.350
They dig into her back story
and find that she, too,

30:36.485 --> 30:38.618
is having an affair.

30:38.687 --> 30:40.687
When the story breaks
in the press,

30:40.756 --> 30:43.156
rumors start to swirl
that perhaps Theresa

30:43.158 --> 30:45.725
had a hand in her husband's
vanishing.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.094
HOFF: Many people are convinced
that Small's wife

30:48.163 --> 30:51.498
actually paid her lover
to murder her husband,

30:51.500 --> 30:54.501
and then they incinerated
his body in the furnace

30:54.636 --> 30:56.836
at the Grand Opera.

30:56.906 --> 31:00.373
WILDMAN: So the police
scour the theater,

31:00.409 --> 31:03.643
but there are no human remains
or even any sign

31:03.646 --> 31:06.980
of a struggle -- in fact,
no matter how hard they search,

31:07.016 --> 31:10.350
they find no hint of Small
anywhere in Canada.

31:10.452 --> 31:14.187
HOFF:
The police searched theater
houses across the country.

31:14.189 --> 31:17.391
They dredged Toronto Bay,
but still no trace

31:17.526 --> 31:19.159
of Small was found.

31:21.663 --> 31:24.197
WILDMAN: With no body
and no evidence to tie

31:24.266 --> 31:26.600
Theresa Small to her husband's
disappearance,

31:26.702 --> 31:28.869
police hit a dead end.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.938
Small's wife was off the hook
as a suspect.

31:31.073 --> 31:34.540
WILDMAN: Then they get
another lead.

31:34.576 --> 31:38.078
Witnesses report that the night
before Small disappeared,

31:38.147 --> 31:40.647
he was seen arguing
with his assistant,

31:40.716 --> 31:43.083
a man named John Doughty.

31:43.218 --> 31:46.086
Doughty, they learned,
had long harbored

31:46.155 --> 31:48.488
resentment towards his boss.

31:48.590 --> 31:51.558
You don't get to where
Small did

31:51.693 --> 31:54.094
in the business world without
making a few enemies.

31:56.398 --> 31:58.664
WILDMAN: And when police
look into Small's assistant,

31:58.701 --> 32:01.901
they discover that he had
stolen $100,000

32:01.971 --> 32:05.372
from Small's safety deposit box
and fled Toronto

32:05.441 --> 32:08.375
the very day Small
was last seen.

32:08.377 --> 32:10.643
The fact that Doughty had
withdrawn all of

32:10.713 --> 32:13.646
this money and then skipped town
instantly put him

32:13.682 --> 32:15.849
at the top of the suspects list.

32:18.587 --> 32:20.187
WILDMAN:
Police track Doughty to Oregon

32:20.289 --> 32:22.856
and bring him back to Toronto
to stand trial.

32:22.858 --> 32:26.059
The assistant admits
to taking the money

32:26.095 --> 32:29.128
but denies ever harming
his former boss,

32:29.164 --> 32:32.331
and with no body,
the case falls apart.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.535
No matter how hard the police
tried to connect Doughty

32:35.604 --> 32:38.672
to Small's disappearance,
they simply couldn't make
the link work.

32:38.674 --> 32:40.807
WILDMAN:
So what's the truth behind

32:40.876 --> 32:43.510
this impresario's
mysterious exit?

32:43.579 --> 32:46.913
Ambrose Small was either
a magician performing

32:46.915 --> 32:49.950
a disappearing act or the victim
of the perfect crime.

32:56.024 --> 32:58.258
It's Toronto, 1920.

32:58.327 --> 33:00.761
A theater producer
named Ambrose Small

33:00.863 --> 33:03.497
has vanished,
seemingly without a trace.

33:03.599 --> 33:07.501
After months of searching,
the case has gone cold.

33:07.503 --> 33:10.837
So is it curtains
for this man of the stage?

33:12.741 --> 33:14.641
The police look
into Small's finances

33:14.710 --> 33:16.643
and learn something
extraordinary.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.912
Before his disappearance,

33:18.914 --> 33:21.782
the businessman had sold
his entire theater empire

33:21.917 --> 33:25.852
to a conglomerate called
TransCanada Theatres, Ltd.

33:25.854 --> 33:28.054
The hasty deal was settled

33:28.090 --> 33:30.323
for $1.7 million,

33:30.426 --> 33:32.992
which Small deposited
right into his bank account.

33:33.062 --> 33:35.462
The very next day,
he went missing.

33:35.464 --> 33:37.697
That was
a highly suspicious move.

33:39.868 --> 33:42.602
WILDMAN: And that leads police
to another explanation

33:42.638 --> 33:45.071
for the impresario's
disappearance.

33:45.074 --> 33:48.207
It seems that Ambrose Small,
as well as pulling off

33:48.243 --> 33:52.279
a brilliant vanishing act,
was also something of
a clairvoyant.

33:52.281 --> 33:56.416
The early 1900s were a period
of great economic uncertainty,

33:56.418 --> 33:59.319
and that very much extended
to the theater world,

33:59.388 --> 34:02.322
so perhaps Small wanted
to get out while he could.

34:02.424 --> 34:05.358
WILDMAN: Some historians
speculate that Ambrose Small

34:05.360 --> 34:07.894
took on a new identity
far from Toronto,

34:07.996 --> 34:10.497
but no proof has ever
been found.

34:10.499 --> 34:14.033
In 1923, the courts declared
Ambrose Small

34:14.103 --> 34:16.903
legally deceased,
and his estate
went to his wife.

34:19.441 --> 34:21.575
WILDMAN: And the story
of the missing producer

34:21.710 --> 34:24.111
fascinates Canadians
for years to come.

34:24.246 --> 34:27.047
HOFF: Well into the 1960s,
people were still

34:27.182 --> 34:29.649
reporting sightings
of Ambrose Small,

34:29.718 --> 34:31.651
and other people were
reporting his ghost

34:31.653 --> 34:33.653
in the Grand Opera theater.

34:33.788 --> 34:36.056
The world may never know
what happened to Ambrose Small.

34:39.261 --> 34:41.161
WILDMAN:
Today, this newspaper clipping

34:41.296 --> 34:43.930
about the curious case
of the Canadian tycoon

34:43.932 --> 34:46.566
remains in the collection
at the New York

34:46.602 --> 34:48.602
Public Library for
the Performing Arts.

34:48.704 --> 34:51.470
It's a reminder
about the small disappearance

34:51.507 --> 34:53.573
that made big headlines.

34:56.712 --> 34:58.811
Oakland, California, is
the only city in the world

34:58.881 --> 35:02.682
to have a natural saltwater lake
entirely within its boundaries,

35:02.817 --> 35:04.850
Lake Merritt.

35:04.887 --> 35:07.954
The lake is rumored to be home
to a black, serpentine creature

35:08.023 --> 35:10.490
first spotted during
the 19th century

35:10.559 --> 35:13.159
and known as
the Oak-ness Monster.

35:13.162 --> 35:16.730
But one institution in town
focuses not on water

35:16.732 --> 35:20.734
but the skies --
the Oakland Aviation Museum.

35:23.305 --> 35:25.305
Its high-flying collection
includes

35:25.307 --> 35:28.408
a small two-seater plane

35:28.477 --> 35:30.877
known as a Kitfox Tail Dragon,

35:30.946 --> 35:34.581
a U.S. Navy reconnaissance jet
named a Douglas Skywarrior,

35:34.650 --> 35:37.016
and a flying boat,

35:37.085 --> 35:39.185
which appeared in the 1981 film,

35:39.254 --> 35:41.488
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

35:44.126 --> 35:46.326
And among these aeronautical
marvels is one

35:46.461 --> 35:48.995
unassuming yet vital item.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.064
BOEHM: The artifact is
rectangular in shape

35:51.133 --> 35:53.132
and is painted
bright orange.

35:53.202 --> 35:55.535
It is fireproof
and nearly indestructible.

35:55.670 --> 35:58.138
Inside, there's moving
mechanical parts,

35:58.140 --> 36:00.340
magnetic tape, and gears.

36:00.475 --> 36:04.510
WILDMAN: This ingenious device
recalls a clever inventor

36:04.580 --> 36:07.380
who revolutionized
the world of aviation.

36:07.382 --> 36:10.817
This is the story of
one man who thought
outside of the box.

36:14.022 --> 36:16.455
WILDMAN: It's 1952
in the United Kingdom.

36:16.491 --> 36:19.759
A new sleek and futuristic
airliner is changing

36:19.828 --> 36:21.728
the way people travel.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.763
It's the world's first
jet-powered

36:23.832 --> 36:25.832
commercial aircraft,
and it flies higher

36:25.901 --> 36:28.602
and faster than any other
passenger plane.

36:28.704 --> 36:31.571
Its name?
The de Havilland Comet.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.808
The Comet was
a commercial success.

36:34.810 --> 36:37.911
People were now able to travel
very fast around the world.

36:37.913 --> 36:40.980
The public loved it.

36:41.049 --> 36:43.416
WILDMAN: But the astounding
aircraft is about to fall

36:43.551 --> 36:45.251
out of favor.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.320
After a year of service,
the Comet started

36:47.455 --> 36:49.389
running into trouble.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.458
WILDMAN: In May 1953,

36:51.560 --> 36:53.726
one of these planes is
flying from Calcutta

36:53.795 --> 36:56.729
to Delhi when it suddenly
plummets out of the sky.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.931
Months later, another Comet,

36:59.001 --> 37:00.767
en route from Rome to London,

37:00.869 --> 37:03.670
bursts into flames
and crashes into the sea.

37:03.739 --> 37:05.872
Two weeks after that,

37:05.874 --> 37:08.975
a third Comet crashes
on its way to Cairo.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.811
The death toll from
these three incidents alone

37:11.880 --> 37:14.513
almost tops 100.

37:14.549 --> 37:17.616
In the aftermath,
British aviation officials

37:17.653 --> 37:21.287
ground the entire Comet fleet
and order an investigation.

37:21.356 --> 37:23.823
They had no real reason why
the Comet aircraft

37:23.892 --> 37:26.593
was falling out of the sky --
it was a complete mystery.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.031
WILDMAN: Experts examine
the wreckage from each

37:32.100 --> 37:34.934
of the three crashes to find
some common cause.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.704
First, they consider
if bad weather

37:37.706 --> 37:39.972
could have been to blame,
but one of the accidents

37:40.008 --> 37:42.208
happened in clear skies.

37:42.244 --> 37:45.512
Next, they examine the plane's
structure, its wings,

37:45.647 --> 37:48.181
engines, and turbines,
for faults.

37:48.316 --> 37:50.516
But again, they draw a blank.

37:50.585 --> 37:52.518
Nobody could figure out
what was going on.

37:52.554 --> 37:54.854
WILDMAN:
So with the investigation
at a dead end,

37:54.890 --> 37:58.191
aviation officials turn
to an Australian fuel chemist

37:58.326 --> 38:00.393
named David Warren.

38:00.429 --> 38:02.662
BOEHM: Warren was in charge of
looking at

38:02.764 --> 38:05.665
how airplane fuels may have
caused accidents

38:05.767 --> 38:08.335
and how can they can be
prevented in the future.

38:11.239 --> 38:13.272
WILDMAN: For Warren,
this task is one

38:13.308 --> 38:15.475
that hits particularly
close to home.

38:15.577 --> 38:17.943
His own father was killed
in an airplane crash

38:17.979 --> 38:20.347
years earlier,
and they never
found out why.

38:20.449 --> 38:23.016
WILDMAN: Warren tests
the Comet's fuel tanks

38:23.118 --> 38:25.618
to see if they could have
caused the disasters,

38:25.654 --> 38:27.954
but he, too, comes up empty.

38:30.425 --> 38:32.525
It seems the reason
for the mysterious crashes

38:32.594 --> 38:34.561
may never be solved.

38:34.663 --> 38:36.896
Without knowing what went wrong,

38:36.965 --> 38:38.965
more lives are at risk.

38:39.034 --> 38:41.400
WILDMAN: But a flash of
inspiration is about

38:41.402 --> 38:43.603
to change flying forever.

38:49.878 --> 38:51.677
It's the 1950s.

38:51.713 --> 38:54.414
Aviation fuel specialist,
David Warren,

38:54.483 --> 38:56.750
is on a machine to uncover

38:56.885 --> 38:59.486
the reason why the world's
first commercial jet,

38:59.488 --> 39:01.821
the de Havilland Comet,
keeps crashing.

39:01.923 --> 39:05.325
Now, a chance encounter
will change flying forever.

39:07.496 --> 39:09.996
One day, Warren,
an avid enthusiast

39:10.098 --> 39:12.532
of the latest technology,
is at a trade fair

39:12.634 --> 39:16.002
showcasing state-of-the-art
gadgets when one

39:16.104 --> 39:18.704
particular device piques
his attention --

39:18.774 --> 39:21.541
a compact voice recorder called

39:21.643 --> 39:24.277
the Minifon Mi 51.

39:24.346 --> 39:26.612
BOEHM: Warren's a gadget guy,
and he had

39:26.681 --> 39:28.848
this brilliant idea --
he thought that

39:28.950 --> 39:32.852
this object may be able to be
adapted to help them
solve this problem.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.524
WILDMAN: If a recorder like this
could be installed

39:37.626 --> 39:39.726
into the cockpit of every plane,

39:39.728 --> 39:42.462
it could keep a running record
of everything that happened

39:42.597 --> 39:45.264
during a flight --
such information

39:45.300 --> 39:49.002
would be highly useful,
especially if things go wrong.

39:49.137 --> 39:53.006
They could capture those last
fatal few minutes

39:53.141 --> 39:56.376
and maybe help tell the story
of why the incident happened.

39:58.847 --> 40:01.281
WILDMAN: Warren purchases
the device and spends days

40:01.416 --> 40:04.884
tinkering with it to adapt it
for use in an airplane cockpit.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.821
He had to get it
so that it could pick up

40:07.923 --> 40:10.623
pilots' voices in a clear way
and filter out

40:10.692 --> 40:12.959
jet engine noise,
the electric motors,

40:13.028 --> 40:15.561
and the hum of the air
conditioning system.

40:15.630 --> 40:19.098
WILDMAN:
Warren also modifies it to log
flight instrument readings.

40:19.100 --> 40:22.768
His new device can record
its speed, rate of ascent,

40:22.804 --> 40:26.039
rate of descent, and what
the engines were doing.

40:26.041 --> 40:29.976
WILDMAN: Lastly and perhaps
most importantly,

40:30.045 --> 40:33.579
Warren designs a steel container
to house the unit.

40:33.615 --> 40:37.183
Inside are multiple layers
of insulation to keep

40:37.318 --> 40:40.019
the recording devices safe
and damage free

40:40.021 --> 40:42.255
in the event of a crash.

40:42.324 --> 40:44.591
The box had to be
indestructible,

40:44.593 --> 40:46.926
it had to be able to withstand
fire, high impact,

40:46.962 --> 40:49.128
and maybe even submersion
in saltwater.

40:49.130 --> 40:51.197
WILDMAN: Warren calls
his finished product

40:51.332 --> 40:54.800
a flight data recorder,
and although his original design

40:54.836 --> 40:57.337
is painted a bright color
for visibility,

40:57.472 --> 41:00.139
eventually, the device takes on
a new name.

41:00.275 --> 41:02.542
This would later be called
the black box.

41:04.946 --> 41:07.080
WILDMAN: Before long,
the black box

41:07.182 --> 41:09.949
becomes a standard piece of
equipment on airplanes

41:10.051 --> 41:12.818
all over the world,
thanks to David Warren.

41:12.854 --> 41:16.489
So that little black box is
inside every commercial

41:16.558 --> 41:18.791
airliner that you fly today.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.096
WILDMAN: As for the Comet's
fatal flaw,

41:23.231 --> 41:25.565
it's eventually determined
that rivets around

41:25.667 --> 41:28.568
the aircraft's windows and doors
were not strong enough.

41:28.637 --> 41:31.904
The Comets had blown apart
at the seams.

41:31.907 --> 41:35.307
Today, this black box sits
on display

41:35.343 --> 41:38.044
at the Oakland Aviation Museum
in California.

41:38.179 --> 41:41.847
It's a symbol of how one man's
ingenuity made the skies

41:41.917 --> 41:44.217
safer for all.

41:47.355 --> 41:49.322
From a cryptic stone

41:49.391 --> 41:51.391
to a missing millionaire.

41:51.493 --> 41:53.459
A boy's dream come true

41:53.562 --> 41:55.662
to a city on the rise.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.997
I'm Don Wildman, and these are

41:58.099 --> 41:59.766
the mysteries at the museum.
