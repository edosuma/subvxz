19:19.859 --> 19:22.662
-Yes, we both love to give
money away.
-(LAUGHS)

19:24.197 --> 19:26.733
I'm so glad you're here,
Christopher.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.106
I'm not used to young ladies
being quite so forward.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.245
I'm not complaining.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.980
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

19:41.047 --> 19:42.882
I'm sure it's no one.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.719
-So are you liking the States?
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

19:46.786 --> 19:48.120
Excuse me.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.396
Hi. I brought you some...

19:59.866 --> 20:01.468
What's going on?

20:04.604 --> 20:06.639
Excuse me?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.876
What does it look like?
A date.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.779
-Forgive me, Patrick, is it?
-What?

20:12.845 --> 20:15.282
I barely know you.
What are you doing in my room?

20:15.348 --> 20:16.983
Cassidy,
what's wrong with you?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.551
What's wrong with me?

20:18.618 --> 20:21.788
I have spoken two words
to you in my entire life.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.557
(COUGHING)
What?

20:24.624 --> 20:27.360
This must be some sort
of mistake, Christopher.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.429
Yes, evidently.
(PATRICK COUGHING)

20:31.230 --> 20:33.566
-Cassidy.
-I'd like you to leave.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.605
Christopher, I don't know
why you're here

20:38.671 --> 20:41.941
or what Cassidy
has told you but...

20:42.008 --> 20:44.944
Cassidy and I just made
love a few hours ago.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.584
-Well, I should probably go.
-No.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.821
Not until you've had a chance
to judge her for yourself.

20:54.887 --> 20:59.826
-To judge her?
-Look, it's Cassidy's purse.
You've seen her wearing it.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.562
Open it and look for
a tape recorder

21:02.629 --> 21:06.566
(COUGHING)
and Cassidy's wallet.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.635
Well, I'm not going to
investigate her.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.575
What...

21:16.409 --> 21:17.944
What do you know?

21:18.010 --> 21:21.080
I think Christopher
will be interested in this.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.818
(INDISTINCT VOICE)

21:25.885 --> 21:27.086
(PATRICK COUGHING)

21:33.192 --> 21:35.061
Good God!

21:35.127 --> 21:40.933
Look, it's the $10,000
that Cassidy took to do
what you just heard.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.003
(COUGHS)

21:44.871 --> 21:46.573
This is extraordinary.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.976
-Christopher, I can explain.
-Not the time.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.379
(SIGHS)

21:52.445 --> 21:54.280
(COUGHING)

21:56.248 --> 21:58.751
So how does it feel
to be used?

21:58.818 --> 22:03.089
-You know better than anyone.
-So we're even.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.927
-Well, we're even all right.
-Gosh, you're a disgusting
little shit.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.832
Well, well, well.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.337
What's wrong with you?

22:18.405 --> 22:22.809
Look at you
with your tight ass
and your perfect little tits.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.144
You still don't get it,
do you?

22:25.211 --> 22:26.679
Get what?

22:26.746 --> 22:29.849
You wouldn't give a guy
like me the fucking
time of day.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.619
But you sure gave it to me
this afternoon.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.389
-Jason told you to do this.
-No, Jason didn't tell me
to do this.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.491
I told Jason to do this.

22:38.558 --> 22:42.294
-What?
-Well, It looks like you lost
your bet on Christopher.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.331
He sure isn't sleeping
with you now,
but you know what?

22:45.398 --> 22:48.234
Don't give Jason the money,
give it to me.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.070
It wasn't Jason's money to
begin with, it was mine.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.641
Okay, I'll slow down.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.744
I arranged the whole thing.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.813
The nerd act, the challenge,
the two bets.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.182
The bet on me gave me
the chance to bang you.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.519
The bet on Christopher
gave me the chance to win
$10,000 back.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.154
All I needed was a partner.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.424
Someone who knows what it's
like to feel rejected.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.626
Hey, toots.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.764
You fuckers.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.867
Honestly, from experience,
I'm not sure you're worth
$10,000

23:20.933 --> 23:23.936
but you're a hell
of a freebie.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.338
I should've known
you couldn't afford that.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.241
So, what did you get
out of this?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.678
One look at the expression
on your face.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.680
Do you believe I found someone
as awful as you?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.348
I mean, come on,
what are the chances?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.950
(BOTH LAUGHING)

23:45.858 --> 23:47.694
Oh, by the way, your story...

23:48.695 --> 23:50.029
It sucked.

23:55.735 --> 24:00.039
You know, it occurred to me,
we go to a school
where they actually play polo.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.842
Fucking sick.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.577
Do you think we hurt her?

24:04.644 --> 24:07.246
Who's ever had sex
where someone didn't get hurt?

24:07.313 --> 24:10.016
You're bitter.
I remember lots of times
when no one got hurt.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.620
Sex is about hurting people.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.427
You know, I never did ask.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.896
Where did you get
the nerd act?

24:23.963 --> 24:28.267
Well, I spent a long time
trying to hide the homely.

24:28.334 --> 24:32.171
And then I realized,
don't conceal it, play it up.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.440
Don't make it better,
make it worse.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.576
-They never see me coming.
-Yeah, well,

24:37.443 --> 24:39.712
I'm too proud to play a nerd.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.414
Well, you've seen the
last of the nerd.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.352
So, what's next?

24:46.418 --> 24:47.854
We'll see.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.421
(SONG PLAYING)

24:57.163 --> 24:59.131
I want to take you home.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.004
I said,
"I want to take you home."

25:05.071 --> 25:07.039
I like a guy with goals.

25:12.478 --> 25:16.115
-Michael, we came
to look at the art.
-I am looking at art.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.586
Something about art.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.520
I find it...

25:22.855 --> 25:24.356
Inspirational,

25:27.627 --> 25:28.828
erotic.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.601
Baby.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.172
Hey, Alison, want a drink?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.742
Uh...

25:42.809 --> 25:46.646
-I have a fiance back home.
-One drink is hardly
an infidelity.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.384
I'm a gentleman.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.520
I don't know.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.931
Come on, the bartender
makes a killer martini.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.466
All right.
(LAUGHS)

26:14.841 --> 26:17.243
-Okay, what do you want,
vodka or gin?
-Hmm?

26:17.309 --> 26:20.312
-Vodka or gin?
-Oh, um, vodka.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.481
Two vodka martinis, please.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.621
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.092
-Do you have a favorite
painting?
-Um...

26:33.159 --> 26:35.327
-I like this one over here.
-Yeah?

26:35.394 --> 26:39.699
-Has a little bit of
a Basquiat feeling.
-Yeah, yeah.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.568
You look really pretty.

26:42.635 --> 26:46.706
You know, I should really
get back to my friend,
but thank you so much.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.874
Okay.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.717
-He's kind of cute.
-You know,
I'm kind of engaged.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.320
But, what about you?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.192
(LAUGHS)

28:46.725 --> 28:48.427
(MOANING)

28:59.338 --> 29:01.740
There, you took me home.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.142
Talk soon.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.550
20-16.
Soccer service.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.925
Game!
Oh!

29:18.991 --> 29:20.927
-Oh!
-(ALISON LAUGHS)

29:20.993 --> 29:22.128
Oh!

29:22.194 --> 29:24.163
-You're dead.
-Oh, what?
What?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.466
What? What?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.539
(LAUGHING)

29:33.973 --> 29:35.441
Sorry.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.476
Next game, you're mine.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.345
Bring it on.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.352
-lf I didn't know better...
-Alison?

29:46.418 --> 29:47.920
-Never.
-Good.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.589
She's engaged,
since the age of two

29:50.656 --> 29:54.760
at least in the
eyes of her family and his
it's part of a larger merger.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.162
Old money.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.564
I have a question.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.734
Does sex always satisfy you?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.370
What do you mean?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.705
I can't remember the last time
I was actually satisfied
by sex.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.040
Is something wrong?

30:08.107 --> 30:09.475
You bored?

30:09.541 --> 30:11.243
I guess so.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.180
Nothing's wrong.
I get bored by sex too,
if I don't use it.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.482
-As what?
-A weapon.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.549
(CHUCKLES)

30:18.384 --> 30:20.052
Sick motherfucker.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.926
How you feeling?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.130
Strangely attracted to you.

30:31.197 --> 30:34.500
-Bad boys and all.
-Nice.

30:34.566 --> 30:38.337
I learned my lesson, but
you're done fucking with me.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.272
Hmm, I told you I loved her.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.044
-You two are plotting
something.
-What about it?

30:45.111 --> 30:47.679
-I came to tell you
it's pathetic.
-Why?

30:47.746 --> 30:51.050
If you had me,
you could have anyone.
Where's the challenge?

30:51.117 --> 30:53.252
It's what you're forgetting
I haven't had you yet.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.621
No, you're giving us
too much credit.

30:55.687 --> 30:59.858
There's no limit to
what two people can do.
You taught me that.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.994
But it's too easy.

31:02.061 --> 31:05.331
So why don't you quit
cooperating and
start competing

31:05.397 --> 31:08.334
for some eligible
bachelorettes.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.768
(BOTH LAUGHING)

31:11.938 --> 31:13.705
It's only fair.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.741
After all,
I can't stand to see you two
look bored.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.250
She's right, you know.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.319
-I have had my eye on her.
-Cassidy?

31:27.386 --> 31:29.321
I do love her, but no. Sheila.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.857
-She's devoted to...
-Michael.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.926
I hadn't noticed.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.363
Someone that sexy has
no right to be faithful
to such an idiot.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.432
-Or to anyone.
-I don't know if I'd pick
Sheila, though.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.334
Why not?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.270
-I like Alison.
-You just said you'd leave...

31:44.336 --> 31:46.705
Until you're married,
you're not married.

31:46.772 --> 31:51.710
Besides, Alison's perfect,
virtuous and loyal, she'd gasp
at all the right moments.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.580
Fine.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.682
I steal Sheila from Michael,
you steal Alison
from her fiance.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.250
First one to cross
home plate wins.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.785
-Wins what?
-How about our dorm room?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.453
-And the loser?
-Fends for himself.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.522
I could use some privacy.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.195
-I'm gonna get started.
-Happy hunting.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.641
I got next.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.843
You got next?

32:29.881 --> 32:31.283
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:37.223 --> 32:39.758
This is some fundraiser
you helped organize.

32:39.825 --> 32:43.529
Thanks, I think the
pier's preservation is
really important.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.468
-Oh, sorry.
-I got it.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.772
-I'm a total klutz.
-That's okay,
here.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.178
I saw that.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.313
-What?
-Patrick.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.415
-It's nothing.
-It's sweet.

33:05.817 --> 33:10.556
ALISON: My parents have always
been really supportive of me.
We have a great relationship.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.125
I had trouble getting my folks
to pay attention.

33:17.196 --> 33:20.132
So are you ready to watch
the master at work?

33:23.869 --> 33:25.537
What was that?

33:25.604 --> 33:28.140
Nothing.
Let's go for a walk.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.711
Hey, what's up?
How you doing?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.713
You gonna be at the game
on Saturday?

33:34.780 --> 33:38.717
-Yeah, of course.
-See you there, buddy.
Take care.

33:38.784 --> 33:41.453
-Yeah. Yeah, I agree.
-He's a great guy.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.954
Awesome polo player.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.918
Okay, what's wrong?

34:13.985 --> 34:16.788
Oh, just thinking of David.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.692
(CHUCKLES)
What?

34:20.759 --> 34:23.129
There's nothing wrong
with missing sex.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.297
-Alison, it's
completely natural.
-(ALISON CHUCKLES)

34:26.364 --> 34:29.868
Okay, I do miss sex,
but that's not the point.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.672
You know, I miss David.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.275
We've known each other
since preschool.

34:36.342 --> 34:41.079
How romantic.
The blankets, the blocks,
the cookies and milk.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.880
You know what I mean.
(CHUCKLES)

34:42.947 --> 34:46.784
It's just sometimes
you sound more like
brother and sister.

34:46.851 --> 34:51.322
Yeah, well, we care about
each other very much.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.025
I know.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.834
PROFESSOR ELRIDGE: These
follow shots are
of the altarpiece from Mission

35:02.901 --> 35:05.504
San Carlos Borromeo
de Carmelo.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.040
Look at the detail.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.710
Absolutely exquisite.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.213
Well, that's it for today.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.115
The department field trip
to Carmel is a go for this
weekend.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.186
And I checked the
sign-up sheet.
We've full capacity.

35:20.252 --> 35:23.722
Those of you attending will
receive extra credit
upon your return.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.767
I'll have somebody
take my place.

35:41.573 --> 35:45.311
I'm sorry, Professor Eldridge
did say the...

35:45.377 --> 35:48.214
-Carmel trip is full?
-Yes.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.650
Ah, I was wondering if you'd
make an exception.
Um...

35:51.717 --> 35:55.254
I normally wouldn't ask,
but I started my paper on
Junipero Serra

35:55.321 --> 35:56.888
-and I was wondering...
-(CHUCKLES)
Jason,

35:56.955 --> 35:59.491
you should've thought
about this from the sign-up
sheet was posted.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.361
-You will have to take it up
with someone else on the list.
-Yeah, I know.

36:02.428 --> 36:05.597
lf there are any cancellations
I'll let you know.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.400
Yeah of course.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.002
Weak.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.104
Really?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.641
Sheila and Michael
are such a cute couple,

36:15.707 --> 36:17.976
and you,
trying to come between them.

36:18.043 --> 36:20.846
-You're just jealous.
-Jealous?

36:20.912 --> 36:24.316
Sheila's going to love my big,
bulging brain.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.717
Let's see it then.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.096
Fucking!
Hate California.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.869
-Jason, what is it?
-What's wrong?

36:43.935 --> 36:46.137
I don't know.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.475
I was supposed to go visit my
grandmother near Carmel but...

36:51.042 --> 36:53.612
I missed the sign-up
for Eldridge's trip.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.046
Why don't you fly?

36:55.113 --> 36:56.948
Kind of on a tight budget.

36:57.015 --> 37:00.552
Mamaw, she just had
both hips replaced.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.955
And she could use some
cheering up, but Eldridge
is being a hard-ass.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.425
-Sheila and I signed up
for that trip.
-Yeah?

37:06.492 --> 37:08.394
Yeah, she's dragging me.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.095
Says I could use
a little culture.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.163
A little culture never
killed anyone.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.301
I have an idea,
would you guys be willing
to visit her for me?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.303
I have some things
you could give her.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.170
Sure, yeah,
but I got a better idea.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.640
Why don't you just take
my place on the trip?

37:21.707 --> 37:24.576
-(JASON CHUCKLES)
-Michael, you and Sheila
planned this.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.813
I don't know, really,
we're mature enough
to spend a weekend apart.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.382
Are you sure?
You've been
looking forward to this trip.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.918
I was only going to Carmel
to be with you.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.986
Why don't we give
Jason a chance to see his
grandmother?

37:35.053 --> 37:37.756
(JASON CHUCKLES)
Um...

37:37.823 --> 37:41.493
Wow, I'm speechless,
but I wouldn't even
consider it

37:41.560 --> 37:43.429
unless it's okay with Sheila.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.466
-Sure.
-Okay.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.902
You guys are saints, really.
I mean, I can just see her
face now.

37:50.969 --> 37:54.139
-It's the least we can do.
-Thanks, you guys.

37:54.205 --> 37:57.175
-Careful, don't try
and steal her.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.545
Come on, we'll go
tell Eldridge.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.157
"Mamaw?"

38:13.725 --> 38:16.562
You never wanted to fuck me
more than right now.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.996
It'll pass.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.079
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-Come in.

38:39.885 --> 38:40.952
Hey!

38:42.454 --> 38:43.889
What's wrong?

38:44.723 --> 38:45.924
Alison,

38:46.892 --> 38:48.394
I love you.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.561
What?

38:50.696 --> 38:52.063
I love you.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.837
Please say something.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.806
I can't believe you
just said that.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.509
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.782
I don't know what to say.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.019
David, your fiance,
are you in love with him?

39:16.054 --> 39:19.124
-We're engaged.
-But are you in love with him?

39:19.190 --> 39:22.260
-Because if you aren't...
-Patrick, I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.896
-What do you mean?
-No, not until you can
talk to me rationally.

39:24.963 --> 39:28.133
I am rational, I promise.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.402
So let me say my piece.
Please?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.405
I love you.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.942
And I think you might love me.

39:37.008 --> 39:41.346
I'd never ask you to
compromise your relationship
for a one-night stand.

39:41.413 --> 39:45.784
Patrick, don't mistake
any of the feelings
that I've shown you for love.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.352
We're friends.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.755
Just because the person
I love,

39:49.821 --> 39:52.157
isn't here now doesn't mean
you can take advantage.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.993
-You're not in love with
David.
-Patrick, stop it.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.062
Don't tell me
who I'm in love with.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.866
But you're spending four years
apart, if you're in love,
you'd never do that.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.400
(ALISON SIGHS)

40:02.468 --> 40:04.903
You know, just because
you can't imagine
a relationship

40:04.970 --> 40:08.206
-that's based on maturity
and trust...
-Maturity and trust?

40:08.273 --> 40:09.608
You sound like a bank.

40:11.943 --> 40:16.314
If you felt any love for
David, any passion,
you wouldn't be here.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.450
-You're wrong.
-I'm right.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.119
-I want you to go.
-Alison.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.220
Go!

40:31.963 --> 40:34.165
-How's it going?
-Right on schedule.

40:34.232 --> 40:37.435
Yeah?
Well, I'm ahead
of schedule.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.705
-Where are you going?
-Carmel.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.442
With Michael and Sheila?

40:44.510 --> 40:47.012
Nope.
Just Sheila.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.751
What? You look surprised.

40:53.351 --> 40:55.521
No.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.957
Look, is it really
that crazy that I'm better
at this than you are?

41:02.060 --> 41:05.531
ALISON: No, he just said,
"I love you"
out of nowhere.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.866
CASSIDY: God, what was
he thinking?
ALISON: I know.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.135
CASSIDY: You're practically
married.

41:10.201 --> 41:15.674
It's so important to our
family and the two businesses.
It's like a legacy.

41:15.741 --> 41:19.444
I mean, David and I have been
meant for each other since...

41:20.546 --> 41:21.780
Forever.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.383
You sound disappointed
by that.

41:29.921 --> 41:33.992
When I first brought up
going to school
out here to David.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.460
You know what he said?

41:36.528 --> 41:38.363
"Go."

41:38.429 --> 41:41.900
And I wanted him to say that,
but then when he did,
I just

41:41.967 --> 41:45.003
I got this weird feeling,
and...

41:45.070 --> 41:48.006
-I found myself wishing
that he'd said...
-No.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.310
It's awful, isn't it?

41:54.112 --> 41:56.982
I mean, he's so
great about it but...

41:57.048 --> 42:00.385
I just found
myself wishing that
he'd be protective...

42:00.451 --> 42:02.688
Love me too much to let me go.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.991
And he didn't and...

42:07.425 --> 42:09.094
It made me wonder.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.565
-Now I don't know.
-What about Patrick?

42:15.400 --> 42:16.835
Patrick?

42:16.902 --> 42:20.672
I care about Patrick,
I'm just, I'm not attracted
to him.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.841
I understand.
(CHUCKLES)

42:22.908 --> 42:25.043
Even if I were,
it's just like,

42:25.110 --> 42:28.179
it's like I'm waiting for
something or someone.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.917
It all sounds terrible,
doesn't it?

42:31.983 --> 42:33.518
No, not at all.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.021
(SIGHS)

42:44.362 --> 42:45.363
(LAUGHS)

42:47.032 --> 42:48.266
One sec.

42:57.142 --> 43:00.612
I probably shouldn't
tell you this, but you're
closer than you think.

43:00.679 --> 43:04.850
-Excuse me?
-That fiance of Alison's
isn't a lock.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.352
-Really?
-Don't lube up yet.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.788
She wants to trade up,
not down.

43:09.855 --> 43:12.824
Maybe if you looked
more like...

43:14.960 --> 43:16.762
Brent.

43:16.828 --> 43:21.466
Let's see, what were her exact
words? Oh, yeah.
"Patrick? I care about him...

43:21.532 --> 43:24.469
"I'm just...
I'm just not
attracted to him."

43:24.535 --> 43:26.504
What, doesn't seem fair?

43:28.840 --> 43:30.441
Life's not fair.

43:52.097 --> 43:56.501
Hi, I, uh, I came
to say I'm sorry.

43:56.567 --> 44:00.672
It wasn't until now that I
realized what your friendship
means to me, and...

44:00.739 --> 44:02.708
-What's that?
-The world.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.012
I respect your relationship
with David, I do.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.915
And, if all I can have is your
friendship, that's fine.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.217
Just please don't shut me out.

44:13.752 --> 44:16.521
So you're okay with
just being friends?

44:16.587 --> 44:18.056
Best friends.

44:24.462 --> 44:27.132
-Good night.
-Thanks, Patrick.

44:27.198 --> 44:29.400
Okay. Bye.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.349
I better go.
I'll miss you.

44:44.415 --> 44:48.186
-Have fun, I love you.
-Take pictures, okay.

44:48.253 --> 44:50.021
-(CHUCKLES)
I'll call you tonight, okay.
-Cool.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.290
I'll keep a close eye on him.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.327
You stopped kissing first.

45:17.148 --> 45:20.618
-I can't believe she told
you about us.
-Yeah.

45:20.685 --> 45:22.720
I can't make her love me
if she doesn't.

45:22.788 --> 45:24.655
It isn't you, Patrick.

45:26.457 --> 45:28.860
You're right.
(CHUCKLES)

45:28.927 --> 45:32.497
God, if she only knew how
many guys
her fiance scared off.

45:33.164 --> 45:35.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

45:35.400 --> 45:39.938
-How many? Who?
Come on, tell me.
-Well...

45:40.005 --> 45:42.673
-Brent Patterson?
-Brent, and Josh Sloane.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.610
Wait, I thought
Brent Patterson
had a crush on Cassidy.

45:45.676 --> 45:48.780
He's tired of her leading
him on, or so I heard.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.785
What's your
Brent Patterson fantasy?

45:55.386 --> 45:56.454
Cop.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.625
Personal trainer.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

46:02.127 --> 46:04.830
You know, he has
a little fantasy about you.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.731
All right...

46:06.798 --> 46:08.967
-Come on, you said...
-No. I know what I said,
but no.

46:09.034 --> 46:10.201
-(LAUGHING)
-No.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.303
Native Americans
helped to complete the

46:12.370 --> 46:17.342
construction
of the Carmel Mission in 1771.

46:17.408 --> 46:22.247
This is the stone that
commemorates the life of the
founder of this mission.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.549
Okay, everybody,
let's move on.

46:26.717 --> 46:28.854
Take this.
Hey.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.757
Come with me.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

46:37.128 --> 46:38.329
(SHIVERS)

46:39.230 --> 46:41.199
Wow.
(CHUCKLES)

46:44.402 --> 46:46.304
Yeah, it's, uh...

46:48.073 --> 46:51.009
It's definitely beautiful.

46:51.076 --> 46:53.979
-Never thought
I'd be cold in California.
-Oh.

46:58.216 --> 46:59.717
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.655
-Is that better?
-Yeah.

47:23.808 --> 47:25.043
I, uh...

47:25.977 --> 47:29.747
-I gotta go.
-Where?

47:29.814 --> 47:32.984
-My grandmother's, remember?
-Right.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.387
Right, okay.

47:36.454 --> 47:37.555
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

47:37.622 --> 47:39.090
I'll be back.

47:41.659 --> 47:42.928
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

48:01.579 --> 48:03.748
We have to talk.

48:03.814 --> 48:06.451
What do you mean
we have to talk?

48:06.517 --> 48:11.222
This isn't working out.
I'm sick of feeling
like your boy-toy.

48:11.289 --> 48:14.192
Fine, I wouldn't have slept
with you anyway.

48:15.526 --> 48:18.096
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

48:18.163 --> 48:23.334
Go blow-dry your hair or lift
heavy stuff or whatever
it is guys like you do.

48:24.669 --> 48:26.404
-Wow.
-Yeah, I know.

48:29.574 --> 48:30.675
Okay.

48:32.110 --> 48:33.578
Cheers, mate.

48:36.147 --> 48:37.548
-Hello.
-Hey.

48:43.188 --> 48:44.990
-Brent. (CHUCKLES)
-Alison.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.458
-Um, I was just leaving.
-You mind?

48:47.525 --> 48:48.559
No.

48:52.097 --> 48:53.131
Hi.

48:54.032 --> 48:55.633
(THUNDER CRACKING)

48:57.735 --> 48:59.604
She's a tough old gal.

49:01.672 --> 49:03.408
She gave me this...

49:04.442 --> 49:06.077
For good luck.

49:08.313 --> 49:09.981
I'm glad you came.

49:11.782 --> 49:12.984
Me too.

49:15.820 --> 49:17.989
Are you a risk-taker?

49:18.056 --> 49:19.524
It depends...

49:22.160 --> 49:24.962
On the risk.

49:25.030 --> 49:28.733
How about a coin toss?
It's the simplest of risks.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.536
Heads, tails, win or lose.

49:33.638 --> 49:36.607
First, for this dollar here.
Heads or tails?

49:36.674 --> 49:37.842
Heads.

49:40.711 --> 49:42.380
Heads. It's yours.

49:43.781 --> 49:47.518
-Now for the relationship.
-(CHUCKLES) What?

49:47.585 --> 49:49.687
Our relationship.

49:49.754 --> 49:53.358
We flip to see what it is.
I mean,
you're confused, right?

49:53.424 --> 49:57.662
So am I.
Are we buddy-buddy or...

49:59.497 --> 50:01.232
I got it...

50:01.799 --> 50:03.668
Master-slave.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.736
(CHUCKLES)
Quit it.

50:05.803 --> 50:08.406
Whoever wins the flip
decides who's master

50:08.473 --> 50:11.376
and who's slave,
just for the night.

Slave is slave,
and master's master.

50:16.514 --> 50:20.585
-So, what's this all about?
-What do you mean?

50:22.853 --> 50:24.722
Dinner, flowers...

50:25.890 --> 50:28.025
It's all just a little...

50:29.560 --> 50:30.761
Sudden.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.836
Look at all the stars tonight.

50:38.903 --> 50:42.873
You know, they say that
you can see the Crab Nebula.
Wow, look...

51:26.884 --> 51:28.886
What are you trying to do?

51:28.953 --> 51:30.955
I'm saying, play with me.

51:31.021 --> 51:34.024
-Stop it, Jason.
-Why?

51:34.091 --> 51:37.528
-Why? You know why.
-Michael?

51:37.595 --> 51:40.298
Yes, Michael.
Of course, Michael.

51:42.233 --> 51:43.234
(SIGHS)

51:45.670 --> 51:47.672
Look, I want you, Sheila.

51:50.241 --> 51:51.909
I want you so bad.

51:53.878 --> 51:57.482
You've imagined what it would
be like to be with me,
haven't you?

51:57.548 --> 51:58.783
Please.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.918
You have.

52:00.985 --> 52:06.023
The more you try and hide it,
the more it shows,
like at the church today.

52:06.090 --> 52:10.395
Admit it, you want to
do this with Michael off
somewhere else.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.365
No, I don't.

52:22.773 --> 52:24.309
Heads or tails?

52:26.010 --> 52:27.545
Heads or tails?

52:28.979 --> 52:31.081
-Jason. (CHUCKLES)
-Come on.

52:36.687 --> 52:37.855
Tails.

52:44.028 --> 52:45.196
Tails.

52:47.398 --> 52:50.301
So who are you?

52:51.369 --> 52:52.970
Master or slave?

52:59.176 --> 53:01.912
Master or slave?

53:05.182 --> 53:06.351
Slave.

53:09.487 --> 53:11.456
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

53:45.390 --> 53:47.258
It's Jason.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.994
Yeah, we're fine.

53:51.762 --> 53:55.300
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

Keep talking no matter what.

54:02.707 --> 54:04.241
No matter what.

Hey, baby.

MICHAEL: Hey, I haven't heard
from you.
How are you?

54:14.419 --> 54:16.287
-Good, how are you?
-MICHAEL: Okay.

54:16.354 --> 54:18.656
-I miss you.
-SHEILA: I miss you too.

-Yeah, so tell me everything.
-Oh, Carmel's beautiful.

-It's pouring rain?
Huh?

-Sheila honey, what are
you guys doing?

you sound weird.

what are you doing?

you're freaking me out.

I'm gonna call you back.

55:54.652 --> 55:56.387
I cheated on David.

Look, you made a mistake.
All right?
Don't worry, it's all...

56:01.926 --> 56:05.996
No, it's not okay.
You don't understand.
(SOBBING)

56:06.063 --> 56:08.065
David trusted me to
come out here.

56:08.132 --> 56:10.501
David does not have to know,
sweetheart.

56:10.568 --> 56:15.339
It's not just David.
It's my family,
it's his family, it's...

56:15.406 --> 56:18.108
You don't have to
tell them anything.

56:18.175 --> 56:20.344
-I don't feel good.
-Just don't tell them.

56:20.411 --> 56:22.680
-I just, I have to go.
-Are you sure?

56:22.747 --> 56:24.314
-Yes.

to remember him by?

-What?
-Brent.

-You will.

-A little out of focus.

of a photographer, but I'd
say they turned out okay.

-How did you...
-Quiet, shh...

-What are you doing?
Patrick!
-I said, quiet.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.846
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

58:01.912 --> 58:04.982
Somewhere in this dorm,
there's an envelope addressed
to David Crestwood

58:05.049 --> 58:08.085
at 7348 Ram Place, Newport,
Rhode Island.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.254
Now in that envelope are more
pictures just like these,

58:10.320 --> 58:12.757
so if you don't keep
your fucking mouth shut

58:12.823 --> 58:15.826
that envelope's
gonna find a mailbox.

-Do you understand?
-Yes.

Good, because if you don't...

58:19.964 --> 58:21.932
Your fiance's not gonna be
the only one who sees these.

58:21.999 --> 58:27.805
I've got some for his family,
for your family...
Oh, stop crying.

58:27.872 --> 58:31.976
They're not gonna go anywhere
if you just show me
the fucking respect I deserve.

I...

58:34.211 --> 58:37.481
-How? How?
-Put Brent up to it?

58:37.548 --> 58:41.652
I paid him 500 bucks
to forget about Cassidy
and sleep with you.

58:41.719 --> 58:44.054
Shh...
Don't tell anyone.

can you believe that?

58:46.356 --> 58:47.592
He must have student loans
to pay off.

Either that, or you
just really aren't his type.

58:51.461 --> 58:54.531
Oh, you are sick! Ow!

58:54.599 --> 58:59.003
Who's sick? I cared
for you, and you rejected
me for David Crestwood

58:59.069 --> 59:02.973
who you just betrayed
for a fucking piece of ass.

Brent was good
enough for you...

for you.

do this.

Yeah, of course
I called her back, but there's
no fucking answer. Shit!

Maybe I'm wrong,
but it sounded
like they were...

59:30.635 --> 59:33.871
-I mean, am I crazy?
-I could see it between them.

59:33.938 --> 59:38.976
You don't know Jason.
He can't control himself.

You do, and the whole campus
will hear the story.

-Well, there is one thing.

-So where's Michael?
-Off, thinking of me.

Why, is something wrong?
I mean, other than with
Mamaw's hips.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.597
You've been meddling.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.835
Why does it matter to you
what I do with Michael?

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:15.305
You're jealous.
You are.

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:17.241
You said you didn't
want to fuck me.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:19.810
I never said I didn't
want to fuck you.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:24.514
Admit it, you care about me.
All this and brains too?

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:27.885
-I think it's you
who's jealous.
-You might be right.

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:47.838
Jason,
I can't believe you don't want
to see the pictures.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.039
Not interested.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:51.942
Oh come on.
So it's a tie.
We're still roommates.

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:55.379
-I didn't know you
had it in you.
-Yeah? How's Alison?

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:58.415
After this kinda thing, they
either gain or lose weight,
and I'm...

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:00.818
Guessing she'll lose weight.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:03.453
What? She needs to drop
the freshman 15.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.323
-I told you.
What you did was wrong.
-What about you and Sheila?

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:09.894
We both had a good time.
What did Alison
ever do to you?

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.562
You have no fucking idea.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.633
-I'm out.
-Too late.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.476
-This is weird.
-What is?

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:30.314
Well, Patrick and I don't have
anything going on,
and I'm not bored.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.883
How do you feel?

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:35.419
-Happy.
-Me too.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.055
One truth?

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.625
One?

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:45.295
After you saw me
mind-fuck Michael into
replacing him on that trip...

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:47.798
Did you ever
fantasize about me?

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:49.666
Maybe.

JASON: Do you believe
in second chances?

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:44.354
If I died and I got the
chance to come back
for one day, any day...

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:48.758
I'd choose this one.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:54.231
Mmm...
That is so pathetic.
(LAUGHING)

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:56.934
-Seriously,
that's your best material?
-It's not material.

01:03:57.001 --> 01:03:58.869
It's how I feel, here.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:05.009
Now, does that feel like a guy
who's using material?

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:11.048
God, Cassidy, when I look
at you, I can barely
put two words together.

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:13.183
Then don't.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:31.868
Slow.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.804
Slow works for me.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:41.078
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.649
I'm having dinner
with Patrick tomorrow.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:51.288
-I'm sorry?
-We set it up a while back.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.958
He insisted.
I have to get rid of him.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.728
Yes, well, you try
and keep your food down.

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:15.379
This better be good.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:18.148
Do you ever wonder
why we are the way we are?

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.684
-What do you mean?
-Morally out there?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:25.589
I'm not quite
so far out there, but I was
born with certain qualities.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.491
I wanted to take
advantage of them.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:31.028
I was born without
those qualities.
When people met me

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:35.199
they were unimpressed,
so I had to impress
myself on them.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.835
I admire you, Cassidy,
and I want you.

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:41.438
I already gave you that.

01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:44.274
If I had satisfied you,
then you would've
been suspicious.

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.443
But let me satisfy you now.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:50.514
Tie you to the bedpost.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.352
I'm a master at two things:
causing girls pain,
and pleasure.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:58.855
I've already caused you pain.
That leaves one thing.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:00.790
You and I are alike.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:04.528

would just seem incestuous.

make it past sake.

Tell me.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:02.152
Patrick said something
about how we're alike.

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:03.753
No, we're different from him.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.923
See, we're fucked up,
but he's...

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.794
Well, he's fucked up.
(CASSIDY CHUCKLES)

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.530
Pay less attention to Patrick
and more to me.

-Why so protective?
-Because.

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.769
-Because?
-Just because.

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.571
Just because?

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.541
Because I care about you.
Do I have to spell
it out for you?

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:27.711
If I don't want you
eating with Patrick,
it's because, yes I'm...

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:30.046
I'm jealous,
and I'm worried.

01:07:30.114 --> 01:07:31.748
What do you want?

01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:37.654
And that's not all.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:44.461
My dad's talking
about expanding his property
holdings out west.

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:45.895
Yeah?

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:49.166
I'm thinking about staying
in Southern California.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.169
We need to talk.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:54.571
Maybe later.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:55.905
Now.

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:58.442
-I know a good exterminator.
-Ha ha.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:01.578
This will take a second.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:04.748
What's up?

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.253
I have a proposition for you.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.188
I told you, I'm out.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.056
Are you telling me
you're satisfied?

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.491
Weren't Alison
and Sheila enough?

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:16.426
Alison and Sheila
were nothing.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.795
Fish so small we had to throw
them back while
the big one got away.

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:20.296
The big one?

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.932
There's only one girl
worth competing for now.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.502
First we cooperated
and fucked her...

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.205
And then she suggests
our little competition.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:30.474
What's left except
competing for Cassidy?

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.042
No, I'm not
competing for Cassidy.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.377
Fuck you.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.283
You're practically
in her pants already.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.818
No, we're taking things slow.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:45.054
So you'll be pissed
if I get up her first?

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.625
This began with Cassidy,
you and me, this has to end
with Cassidy, you and me.

01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:51.595
You two suddenly
have these feelings, what
the fuck are you afraid of?

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.962
-Not you.
-What's wrong?

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.800
You're trying
to win her anyway.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.435
Beat me.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:00.170
Rub my nose in it.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.671
You know you want to.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.109
Oh, don't be a fucking pussy.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.917
-What do I win?
-To make it official?

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:17.220
One dollar.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.325
Good luck.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.229
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:30.834
You got my note.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.136
Pretty serious stuff.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:36.506
So let me get this straight,
you're in love with me?

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.107
Sucks to be me.

01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.219
So did you uh...

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:51.421
Did you change your mind?

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:54.224
I've come to say
that I've figured you out.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:58.662
You've noticed that Jason
and I are in love, and you're
trying to break us up.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.564
What?

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.932
You know I don't
fall that easy.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.109
You and Jason have
always had a thing.

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:15.579
But we only just fell in love.

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.714
So you only
just started caring.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.683
Cass, I've always cared.

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:22.819
Do you care that
no one's ever gonna fall
in love with you?

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.854
I don't know
if you can love.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.757
But you like
hating more anyway.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:31.495
Are you uglier on the outside
or on the inside?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:35.299
When you've been ignored
as long as I have, we'll see
what you do to get noticed.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:38.902
Take it from me sweetheart,
you would rather get
fucked than ignored.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.337
I guess so.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.443
You can't sweep me
under the rug...

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:49.546
Anymore than my fucking
parents, my fucking school
or this whole fucking world.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.348
You sweep too much
under the rug

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:54.351
suddenly the rug's
not big enough
to cover it all.

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:59.589
You really love Jason.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:02.526
-Yes.
-And he really loves you?

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:04.260
Yes.

01:11:04.328 --> 01:11:06.129
You sound so sure...

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.932
But love is blind.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:12.502
It's too late to
change my mind.
I'm meeting Jason at 8:00.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:14.471
Jason doesn't love you.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:21.210
What if I said,
not once, but twice now...

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.548
You've been the prize
in one of our little contests?

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.083
What if I said Jason
and I made a bet

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.086
to see who could
make you forget
what we did to you

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:34.257
and fuck with your
mind and body
all over again?

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:36.360
Did you hear what I said,
Cassidy?

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:37.827
Jason doesn't love you.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:40.997
He just wants to fuck you
so he can win the bet.

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:44.368
That's not true.

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:47.170
You know it is.

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.439
Jason wouldn't do that to me.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.377
You know Jason.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:56.346
It was as much
your bet as it was his.

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:58.582
Yeah,
but I'm telling you about it.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.818
Do you think Jason
was going to tell
you about it?

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.688
Trust the truth.

01:12:05.389 --> 01:12:07.891
I want you, Cassidy.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:10.126
I don't want you
under false pretenses.

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:12.295
I want you here and now.

01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:16.466
I can't.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.902
I've never met
anyone like you

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:21.471
and you've never met
anyone like me.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:24.374
I am the only guy
on the face of the earth

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:27.210
who's worthy to be
in the same room with you.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.946
For once,
I'm telling it like it is.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.280
Trust me.

01:12:53.437 --> 01:12:56.072
You can tie me down.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.492
For you.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.329
Jesus.
What happened?

01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:58.935
You had to choose
between me and Patrick...

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.204
And you chose Patrick.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.372
If it's Patrick you want...

01:14:06.543 --> 01:14:10.013
Jason, Jason, Jason.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:12.849
I crossed the finish line
a half-hour ago.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.120
But don't feel bad,
I've never won by less.

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:19.923
How could you?

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:22.959
I really loved you.

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:24.227
I loved you too.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.162
There's no such thing.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:29.666
Now I'd like you both
to leave me alone.

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:33.336
First I want Jason to tell me
what it's like to be a victim.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.671
Fuck you.

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:38.441
(CHUCKLES)
Actually,
you're both my victims.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:41.344
-Why?
-Because you were in love...

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.412
And now thanks to me
you're not.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.114
See what happens
when you underestimate?

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.584
We underestimated
the evil in you?

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:50.153
You underestimated the evil
in yourselves.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:53.523
So you don't know
what it feels
like to be a victim?

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.692
-No.
-I'd love to teach you.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.361
Sorry, I've got plans.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.667
I'm sorry too.

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:08.137
But once you've been
convicted of my rape,
you won't be making any plans.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.476
Oh, I thought we weren't
going to tell him.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:16.913
Sorry, I just had
to see his face.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.549
You know,
she's gonna charge you
with sexual assault.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:22.552
I'm sure the authorities
will be sympathetic.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:26.522
Semen samples, fingerprints...

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.257
Wrist abrasions...

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.827
Torn clothes...

01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:33.897
Plus one
of your sleeping pills...

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.199
In my bloodstream.

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:37.934
Recognize?

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.269
Jason swiped them.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:42.171
I just took one myself...

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:44.974
But the doctor won't know
the difference.

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.544
(MOCK CRYING)
Patrick came over to talk...

01:15:48.612 --> 01:15:52.782
But he must have slipped
something into
the wine because...

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:55.184
(SIGHS)
I started to feel sleepy.

01:15:55.819 --> 01:15:57.320
And then...

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.122
He locked the door.

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.626
And then he grabbed me and...

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:05.194
He tried to tie me down.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.262

(CASSIDY EXHALES)

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:11.801
I tried to struggle,
but the knots were so tight.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:14.638
And then...

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:16.405
He raped me.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:19.342
If only I had arrived in time.
I mean, I could've helped.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:24.648
(SNIFFLES)
See what happens
when you underestimate?

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:27.250
You took me so lightly.

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.518
So I suggested
the Sheila-Alison thing...

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.688
Because I knew
a competition for them...

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:34.924
Would lead to
a competition for me.

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:39.395
Alison was a tough nut
until I dangled Brent
in front of you.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:40.697
And that's when
you got the idea

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:44.000
that maybe Brent
could go places you couldn't.

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:46.069
And what do you know...

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.738
Your little game with
Sheila and Alison ended
in a photo finish

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:52.141
which led you right back
to you-know-who.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.678
Only you weren't
competing for me

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.146
you were
competing against me.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:17:00.850
And this time,
Jason and I got
to each other first.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:06.289
After what you did to Alison,
I was happy to help.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.456
So...

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.194
Here's your dollar.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.063
I'm looking forward to having
my own room.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.801
And you're off to prison...

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.636
Where the sex
is never boring.

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:25.241
The police should be
out front right about now.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:27.343
They were called
20 minutes ago.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.646
You're a fucking bitch!
They will never believe you.

01:17:30.714 --> 01:17:32.581

Would you mind telling me
what this is all about,
please?

We'll let you know
down at the station.

into my drink.

It's her word against mine.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.902
And she's lying.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.706
-I don't have
to say anything.
-We know.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:18:00.109
But I want to clear
my name from the lies
of a jilted convicted person.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.446

Mr. Bates, another victim
has come forward.

01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:13.656
Watch your head, now.

Ends?

It's still kind of soon.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.530
Well, if it means anything,
I'm done playing games.

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:56.465
What you did,
it wasn't easy...

01:18:56.532 --> 01:18:59.235
But I know why you did it.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:00.736
-Why?
-Because after everything

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:04.607
that we put you through,
you finally wanted out.

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.509
Wrong.
(LAUGHS)

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.945
I wanted back in.

01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:14.918
See, Patrick's out of the way,
Prince Christopher's
had time to heal...

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:19.188
10,000 bucks says
I can be down those
swim trunks by midnight.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.792
(CHUCKLES)
What about us?
I mean...

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:26.896
The only problem fucking
with someone
as twisted as yourself

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:30.299
is you're fucking
with someone
as twisted as yourself.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.501
Well?

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:34.537
I knew you'd understand.

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:39.909
Did you have a nice swim?

01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:41.144
Yes, thank you.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.379
Let's go get a drink.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.914
Why the hell not?

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:46.182
(SONG STARTS PLAYING)

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.454
(CHUCKLES)

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.688
(LAUGHS)
