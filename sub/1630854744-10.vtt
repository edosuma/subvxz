WEBVTT

00:52.678 --> 00:53.929
Sorry.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.077
How did it happen?

01:17.077 --> 01:21.456
I got OPD
reviewing CCTV footage of the area.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.002
You have to find who did this. Please.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.546
Think Rochelle might be the shooter?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.090
I'm not ruling anything out.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.969
I got unis planted
outside of Trey's old house

01:33.969 --> 01:36.096
and the recording studio.
Both are dark.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.684
We also got eyes on the blade,
but nothing so far.

01:40.684 --> 01:44.104
If we can get Rochelle to confess
to murdering Finney,

01:44.104 --> 01:46.773
then she can flip on
whoever ordered her to do it.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.152
It's possible
that person is behind this too.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.324
But what if Eva wasn't the target?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.578
Trini.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.375
She was about to testify against Ochoa.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.710
Maybe the shooter missed.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.630
Or Eva was protecting Trini.

02:10.506 --> 02:14.968
- So this was because of me?
- No. Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.864
- You seen Rochelle?
- She ain't been around here in a minute.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.668
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.795
Any word?

04:14.296 --> 04:16.507
Nah, Rochelle's not around.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.801
It's just weird
'cause she never misses a cash drop.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.553
That's a big deal.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.932
Something's up. She must be laying low.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.186
Trey always did the same
when shit was going down with the cops.

04:30.062 --> 04:33.315
- Has Rochelle been acting strange lately?
- Not really.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.360
Just extra talk
about how we're gonna have to step up.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.946
- Step up how?
- Like go recruit.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.616
I didn't wanna do it.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.374
Thanks, Devon.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.336
I'll be in touch.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.800
How're you holding up?

05:00.384 --> 05:04.972
- Well, I haven't had a drink.
- Good.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.057
But I'm gonna to tell Zarina
about what happened with us.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.141
That's a bad idea.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.309
- Listen.
- She's pregnant.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.228
- It's gonna confuse the situation...
- I know you disagree.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.522
- ...and gonna make her insecure.
- But I need to be honest when--

05:14.022 --> 05:15.482
Did I step in something?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.526
- No.
- Not at all. No.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.153
Any updates?

05:20.153 --> 05:24.366
Well, ballistics says a Five-Seven
is the likely murder weapon.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.034
Can't know for sure until we find it.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.579
It is still possible
that Rochelle was the shooter.

05:28.579 --> 05:29.746
What about Ochoa?

05:29.746 --> 05:33.000
I know for a fact he has
a hunting license, all right.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.085
And he has a membership
to a shooting club.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.129
The lieutenant's gonna bring him in
and question him.

05:37.129 --> 05:42.593
Okay. Until we find Rochelle,
we should start focusing on Hackman.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.512
We know about the one-way messaging, so...

05:45.512 --> 05:46.847
Yep.

05:46.847 --> 05:51.977
And we know Ochoa's surveillance company
supplied the feed for blackmail.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.314
What would be Hackman's motivation
for blackmailing these men?

05:55.314 --> 05:58.400
Look at 'em.
They're successful developers.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.652
Bay Area power players.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.907
Maybe Hackman wanted to ensure favors
from them for Questeur.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.867
So Hackman gets favors

06:06.867 --> 06:10.120
and the johns get to live out
their illicit fantasies

06:10.120 --> 06:11.830
in a protected environment.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.335
Right.

06:18.462 --> 06:23.133
But Hackman and Finney go way back
to their college days.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.718
They were friends.

06:25.385 --> 06:30.474
So if Hackman's the guy,
what would make him blackmail Finney now?

06:34.394 --> 06:38.440
Lee thought of Andrew as a frat boy
with a big future.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.653
Of course that was before we learned
about his criminal dealings.

06:42.653 --> 06:47.783
Are you aware that Finney threw parties
at Stanford with underage girls?

06:47.783 --> 06:51.411
I heard rumors. But I never believed them.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.455
Finney was top of his class,

06:53.455 --> 06:57.125
and he was always the most charismatic man
in the room.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.711
Well, did your husband go
to any of Finney's parties?

07:01.213 --> 07:02.256
Sometimes.

07:02.256 --> 07:06.718
See. I think Lee was blackmailing Finney.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.388
Blackmailing? They were friends.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.266
Maybe Lee needed a way
to strong-arm Finney

07:12.266 --> 07:16.061
into using his influence
on the city council to help Questeur.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.689
Finney changed his vote on the zoning
for the campus,

07:18.689 --> 07:22.568
but that doesn't mean
that Lee blackmailed him into doing it.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.738
My theory is he's heading up
the sex trafficking ring.

07:27.906 --> 07:32.828
This company is his life's work.
Why would he jeopardize that?

07:33.412 --> 07:34.913
I've come to understand

07:34.913 --> 07:40.335
that sometimes people you love
do things you don't expect.

07:41.879 --> 07:47.551
Whose idea was it to have you deal mostly
with the philanthropy side of things?

07:49.595 --> 07:50.596
His.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.098
Leaving him to run the corporation?

07:53.098 --> 07:55.434
I know what you're getting at,
and you're wrong.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.103
Just because Lee runs the business

07:58.103 --> 08:01.190
doesn't mean that I'm oblivious
to its operations.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.566
Then help me.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.861
Give me access
to Questeur's accounting files,

08:05.861 --> 08:07.446
tax documents, employee files--

08:07.446 --> 08:09.281
You're asking me to hand over records

08:09.281 --> 08:11.783
so that you can use them
against my husband.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.705
My husband of 30 years.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.291
If there's nothing to hide,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.252
then there should be no problem
helping us.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.265
Hey. Got your favorite.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.894
Strawberry ice cream and half-and-half.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.273
Mom, I've--

08:44.191 --> 08:45.859
I've been seeing the news.

08:47.611 --> 08:53.075
And there was even a cop
who was part of the ring.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.494
And he refused to testify against them.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.412
That's true.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.873
That means that he's scared of them.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.958
How do you feel?

09:05.128 --> 09:06.129
I...

09:09.007 --> 09:11.510
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna testify.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.262
Okay.

09:13.262 --> 09:17.724
If you don't testify,
that means Ochoa could walk.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.271
I know, but I--

09:23.313 --> 09:25.858
I've been thinking about it a lot and--

09:26.608 --> 09:31.530
And I ID'd him to the police
after the mixer and everything.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
He got arrested,
but then he got out on bail.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.702
They all did. And--

09:36.702 --> 09:38.996
And then they found
that I had drugs in my system.

09:38.996 --> 09:42.833
His lawyers said
that my ID shouldn't count.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.837
The judge will still take your ID
into consideration at the trial.

09:46.837 --> 09:53.260
But Melanie told me that the police found
a video of her with her john.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.181
And that means that he will be
found guilty at his trial. Right?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.433
That's right.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.311
But we haven't gotten a call
about a video of me with--

10:03.729 --> 10:05.731
That means that there isn't one.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.608
I don't know. I just feel like--

10:07.608 --> 10:10.110
I feel like I'm terrified of doing
this thing

10:10.110 --> 10:11.778
that might not even put him in jail.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.572
She's not doing
another preliminary hearing.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.781
- This is too dangerous.
- Zarina.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.533
There has gotta be another way
to get Ochoa.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.493
There has to be.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.956
All right.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.544
I wanna do right by Ms. Pierre. I do.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.549
But, Daddy, they tried to kill me.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.636
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- I can't.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.679
It's all right, sweetheart.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.780
Ezra.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.948
<i>I know it's late.</i>

10:56.532 --> 10:58.534
I just heard just about Eva Pierre.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.495
- So tragic.
- It is.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.206
You know, she reached out to me
a few days ago.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.459
Begged me not to take legal action
against you.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.003
She did?

11:11.129 --> 11:14.466
She said, by not airing her interview,
you were just trying to protect her

11:14.466 --> 11:16.426
from being judged
in the court of public opinion.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.889
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- Listen.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.935
Boisterous is still your partner.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.188
<i>I shouldn't have rushed to conclusions.</i>

11:28.188 --> 11:29.273
Well, thank you.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.026
<i>She really believed in the mission.</i>

11:34.653 --> 11:35.654
<i>Good night.</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:40.492
This is Detective Billy Aames.

11:40.492 --> 11:44.580
I'm en route with a gunshot victim
arriving in approximately four minutes.

11:44.580 --> 11:48.750
- Do you remember when we first met?
- You shouldn't talk.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.960
I thought,

11:51.253 --> 11:53.130
"Damn, this bitch is louder than me.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.923
How's this going to work?"

11:55.632 --> 11:57.384
Well, we found a way, though.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.095
Nobody was talking about these girls
before you.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.680
We did that together.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.518
Can I tell you something?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.479
Don't.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.564
As friends?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.109
I went to Finney's funeral.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.615
Not out of respect or anything.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.953
- To close the book. I get it.
- I knew you would.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.874
<i>I knew you would.</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:46.975
At least this time I'm looking
for evidence linked to an actual crime.

12:47.726 --> 12:51.897
Even though she wasn't kidnapped,
what Emily Mills did was criminal.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.024
What was her punishment?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.567
Community service.

12:56.527 --> 12:57.945
That's the system for ya.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.404
Well, I got more good news.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.697
We brought Ochoa in,

13:00.697 --> 13:03.242
and he swears he was at home
with his wife.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.286
- Their stories line up with each other.
- Of course they do.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.999
A call from his cell phone,
ordered Chinese food to the house.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.085
And we don't have a murder weapon.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.463
The gun he takes
to the shooting club isn't it.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.675
Hey, I have checked AFIS. There's nothing.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.386
Aames, you and I both know anybody
can get a gun illegally.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.137
It wouldn't show up on any database.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.182
Well, there's nothing usable
on the courthouse cameras either.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.393
- Goddamn it.
- I'm sorry.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.477
Hey.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.230
Thank you.

13:33.230 --> 13:37.317
Well, we got two killers to find
and a trafficking ring to nail.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.735
Herbie, start us another pot.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.987
- You got it.
- Thanks.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.156
This is--

13:43.740 --> 13:46.660
This is Questeur's early profit margin.
It's in the red.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.913
It looks like the company was drowning
when they first started it.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.542
That's common for most start-ups.

13:54.877 --> 13:59.840
Hold on. Check this out. See here?
Zero investors.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.136
Then, six months later,
there's a great, big turnaround.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.304
Look at all this.

14:07.181 --> 14:11.101
Maybe Hackman started trafficking girls

14:11.101 --> 14:13.437
to bring in wealthy investors to Questeur.

14:13.437 --> 14:14.521
Maybe.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.732
The blackmail videos date back
to that year.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.819
It's Devon.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.489
- Hey.
- Hey, Poppy. Rochelle's here.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.782
Okay, gotcha.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.243
Rochelle's down at the blade.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.579
- You guys go. I got it. Okay.
- We'll call you.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.663
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

14:31.663 --> 14:33.498
You not listening.
I'm trying to tell you something.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.667
- What you talking about?
- I'm trying to tell you about these girls.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.752
Oh, sh--

14:38.462 --> 14:41.131
- Hey!
- Freeze!

14:41.131 --> 14:43.675
- Freeze! OPD!
- Rochelle!

14:44.259 --> 14:46.136
- Stop! OPD!
- Rochelle, stop!

14:46.136 --> 14:47.638
Hey!

14:47.638 --> 14:49.348
Stop running!

14:49.348 --> 14:50.724
Stop, goddamn it!

14:52.559 --> 14:53.560
Stop!

15:00.817 --> 15:02.402
- I'll go this way.
- All right.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.418
Hey! Rochelle!

15:18.418 --> 15:21.255
Hey! Stop! Goddamn it!

15:25.384 --> 15:26.385
Stop running!

15:28.387 --> 15:29.513
Easy.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.181
Hey, Rochelle. Stop.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.016
- Freeze! OPD!
- It's over.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.644
Stop! Relax!

15:35.644 --> 15:36.645
- It's over.
- Relax!

15:36.645 --> 15:38.313
Give me your hands.

15:38.939 --> 15:42.234
So I hear you're running shit now.
You trying to be like Trey?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.029
I loved Trey, but he was small-time.

15:46.530 --> 15:50.117
- I'ma be way bigger than him.
- Yeah? Then what's your end game?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.577
I was promised things.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.996
Well, whoever is promising things
is going down.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.957
And where's that gonna leave you?
Let's go.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.836
Rochelle Johnson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Andrew Finney.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.797
You have the right to remain silent.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.596
- Hey.
- Poppy.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.014
- Yes?
- It's Sybil.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.098
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:13.098 --> 16:15.934
Lee's talking the board
into shutting down the app,

16:15.934 --> 16:18.770
so he can get rid
of the one-way messaging function.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.356
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

16:28.530 --> 16:31.408
Now this becoming a routine
for you, Miss Johnson.

16:36.455 --> 16:40.584
Security cams show her in the elevator
going back-and-forth to the laundry room

16:40.584 --> 16:42.503
at the time of Eva Pierre's murder.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.545
Told you.

16:43.545 --> 16:47.216
Well, so you're alibied for Eva.
Not Finney.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.843
Just 'cause I picked up a car
don't mean I killed somebody.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.347
True. But Finney made a dying declaration.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.475
Do you know what that is?

16:57.309 --> 16:59.478
After your hit-and-run,
he was still alive.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.855
He told officers he saw the driver.

17:04.316 --> 17:05.608
He named you.

17:06.693 --> 17:12.324
Rochelle, if you cooperate,
the DA will go easier on you.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.993
Fuck.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.213
It was payback.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.550
When I got outta jail,
I went to the studio.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.679
I saw Sun shoot Trey
and then plant a piece on him.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.058
Later, I heard him on the phone
talking 'bout he took care of it.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.477
Did you hear who he was talking to?

17:40.477 --> 17:44.314
No. But he said,
"I heard you're planting a fucking tree."

17:44.314 --> 17:45.399
Finney.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.945
Later, I saw on the news
some campaign event

17:50.529 --> 17:52.072
with Finney planting a tree.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.324
So I tracked him down.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.534
For revenge?

17:56.034 --> 17:59.121
At that point? No.
There was a job opening.

18:00.706 --> 18:03.667
Told him I was Trey's girl,
and I knew what he did.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.255
Told him I wanted a promotion
in exchange for my silence.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.299
I gave him my number.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.426
Did he contact you?

18:13.218 --> 18:16.138
I got a text from the Q-app.
Unknown number.

18:17.014 --> 18:19.224
Said to stand by for further instructions.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.393
What's your passcode?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.020
2513.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.481
But the shit disappears.

18:30.569 --> 18:34.406
All right. Then talk to us.
When did you hear from him again?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.326
Took a few weeks to get a text message.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.953
"Pick up the car and take out Finney."

18:41.955 --> 18:45.334
And that's when I understood he wasn't
the one calling the shots.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.919
Who was?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.462
Never met the boss.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.425
But I was promised a new life
to do the hit.

18:53.425 --> 18:56.303
So you ran him over three times?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.475
I don't play.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.608
She gave it all up.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.110
That's one down.

19:13.153 --> 19:17.699
You know, Devon told me that Rochelle
had been hiding out in a condo downtown.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.286
It must've been payment
for taking out Finney.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.921
You can't reply, can you?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.298
No.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.181
We're keeping Rochelle's appointment.

19:46.562 --> 19:48.313
We got a view of the roof.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.315
<i>Copy that.</i>

19:50.315 --> 19:52.568
A black SUV is pulling in down here.

19:52.568 --> 19:53.735
<i>Got it.</i>

20:07.457 --> 20:10.836
It's not Hackman. It's his driver, maybe?

20:15.257 --> 20:16.508
He's on his phone.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.761
Yeah, I'm here. I'm in the parking lot.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.638
No sign of anyone.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.900
All right. All right. I'll be there.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.617
We have to find out
who he reports back to.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.749
Okay, he's on his way back down.
Follow him.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.046
He's going north on Telegraph.

20:54.630 --> 20:57.299
I think I know where he's going.
We're on our way.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.383
<i>All right.</i>

21:24.826 --> 21:27.579
I lost him in the crowd.
But the envelope is in the car.

21:28.497 --> 21:32.084
Okay, but we have to find him reporting
back to Hackman.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.044
- Let's do it.
- Okay. I got the middle.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.088
I got the far right.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.691
Mr. Hackman, right here, please.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.418
Good day, Oakland!

22:16.545 --> 22:19.089
This is a new day for Questeur.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.302
We are officially joining
the community here in Oakland,

22:23.802 --> 22:27.055
- bringing jobs, and industry...
- Anything?

22:27.055 --> 22:30.309
...and opportunity to the East Bay!

22:34.396 --> 22:37.274
We can and will do this together.

22:37.900 --> 22:41.403
The people of Oakland, its leaders

22:41.403 --> 22:45.657
and those of us here at Questeur
envision a better world.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.745
He couldn't have sent it. It's not him.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.206
And who doesn't want a better world?
Am I right?

22:52.873 --> 22:54.333
We could use it.

22:54.917 --> 22:58.170
Let's give San Francisco
and Silicon Valley a run for their money.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.254
What do you say?

22:59.254 --> 23:01.256
- Absolutely!
- Yeah!

23:01.256 --> 23:03.425
And so now, without further ado,

23:04.009 --> 23:09.097
I would like to introduce to you
your mayor-elect, Everett Hoagland.

23:13.685 --> 23:14.686
Thank you, Lee.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.024
- To all of you turning out at the polls...
- I'll stay with Hackman.

23:19.024 --> 23:19.942
Good.

23:19.942 --> 23:23.737
...and using your power as citizens
to vote for what you believe in.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.572
We are a city that is bleeding.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.657
Two days ago...

23:28.867 --> 23:29.868
Sybil.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.079
Poppy.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.707
- I don't know how I missed it.
- I'm sorry?

23:35.707 --> 23:38.961
You contacted Nadia Jimenez
all those years ago.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.630
You held on to that video.

23:42.923 --> 23:46.009
And then, when Questeur was
having trouble getting off the ground,

23:46.009 --> 23:47.761
you blackmailed Finney with it.

23:48.637 --> 23:50.931
He changed his vote
to move Questeur to Oakland.

23:51.598 --> 23:56.603
Wow. You will go to amazing lengths
for a story. It's impressive.

23:56.603 --> 23:59.898
Finney told you
about Rochelle's desire to step up.

23:59.898 --> 24:03.819
So when he became a liability,
you dispatched her to take him out.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.487
Why would I traffic women?

24:05.487 --> 24:10.450
My guess is, in some twisted way,
you did it out of love.

24:10.450 --> 24:14.705
Lee was trying to save Questeur.
You wanted to help but were shut out.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.792
Then, you remembered
Finney's successful parties.

24:19.418 --> 24:24.256
So you already knew how some men
would dole out huge favors

24:24.256 --> 24:27.176
in exchange for sex with underage girls.

24:27.676 --> 24:30.929
They gave you funding, zoning, access.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.723
You were making it happen for Questeur.

24:33.307 --> 24:36.894
You created the one-way messaging.
You ran the ring.

24:36.894 --> 24:40.189
Hold on. You have a podcast, not a badge.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.107
- You've got the wrong person.
- Exactly.

24:42.107 --> 24:45.736
There's no way that Sybil
could create that function.

24:45.736 --> 24:49.907
Really? I mean, wasn't she
a prolific coder once upon a time?

24:49.907 --> 24:51.825
Well, that was a very long time ago.

24:51.825 --> 24:54.578
But for many years she's been running
a charitable foundation.

24:54.578 --> 24:55.996
I do more than that.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.457
With you,
she was forced into a supporting role.

24:58.457 --> 25:01.960
Running the trafficking ring
is all under her control.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.713
Absurd. It would jeopardize
everything I've been building.

25:04.713 --> 25:06.423
Everything you've been building?

25:09.426 --> 25:10.677
When we needed investors,

25:10.677 --> 25:14.640
you sat around and sent emails to VCs.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.807
And then you moped.

25:15.807 --> 25:19.353
I wasn't about to lose a company
that I helped create,

25:19.853 --> 25:22.314
so I found a way to fund it,

25:23.190 --> 25:24.525
to expand it,

25:26.193 --> 25:27.653
to control it.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.530
By doing this? By breaking the law?

25:29.530 --> 25:33.200
Where was this pious outrage
when Finney was doing it?

25:34.159 --> 25:38.664
I made you rich.
One of the most respected men in tech.

25:38.664 --> 25:39.915
What about the girls?

25:41.750 --> 25:42.918
What about them?

25:42.918 --> 25:45.295
The pawns in your game
weren't just the men.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.172
There were children too.

25:47.172 --> 25:51.218
And until you,
no one was even looking for them.

25:51.969 --> 25:55.681
Who's gonna believe that a woman
controlled a trafficking ring?

25:55.681 --> 25:56.849
You have nothing.

26:01.311 --> 26:05.566
<i>I made you rich.
One of the most respected men in tech.</i>

26:05.566 --> 26:07.067
<i>What about the girls?</i>

26:07.067 --> 26:08.610
- What is this?
- What about them?

26:08.610 --> 26:13.198
Sybil Hackman, you're being arrested
for violation of the RICO Act,

26:13.198 --> 26:15.075
conspiracy to commit murder.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.619
I'll take the phone.
Put your hands behind your back.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.084
Let's go.

26:58.285 --> 27:00.996
Yeah. All right. Thank you, sir.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.751
That was the DA.

27:05.751 --> 27:07.127
We were able to confirm

27:07.127 --> 27:09.630
that Sybil sent
the hidden Questeur messages.

27:09.630 --> 27:13.509
She's looking at 20-plus years
for trafficking and murder for hire.

27:13.509 --> 27:16.512
Were you able to link Ochoa
to Sybil through the messaging?

27:16.512 --> 27:17.596
No.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.933
No, Ochoa will likely
get a year in county jail

27:20.933 --> 27:24.686
for storing the blackmail videos,
which he'll probably do on a work release.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.104
- But--
- Hey.

27:28.065 --> 27:30.734
Trini remembers
seeing Bill Ochoa at the courthouse.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.444
- She saw him?
- So, we have a witness?

27:32.444 --> 27:35.072
Hold on. Not his face exactly.

27:35.072 --> 27:39.326
She says he does this thing with his neck.
She saw it at the mixer house.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.287
She knows Ochoa was the shooter!

27:42.287 --> 27:44.373
Markus, you know that's not enough.

27:44.373 --> 27:49.294
I still need justice for my daughter.
Can't Sybil confirm that Ochoa raped her?

27:49.878 --> 27:53.257
Look, we tried, and she's not talking.

27:56.426 --> 28:01.181
Trini deserves better. So does Eva.

28:13.485 --> 28:17.281
So, if you're solving for Y,
then you need to...

28:17.781 --> 28:20.158
Add negative eight to both sides.

28:20.158 --> 28:21.535
That's what's up.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.453
- You got this.
- Hey, you two.

28:24.454 --> 28:27.040
- Cydie here yet?
- No. No, she has no idea.

28:29.459 --> 28:33.255
So, how are you doing
with the Alexander of it all?

28:36.175 --> 28:38.594
Part of me hopes
Markus is not able to find the address.

28:38.594 --> 28:39.803
And the other part--

28:40.512 --> 28:43.140
- Here she is.
- Mrs. Cydie.

28:45.851 --> 28:47.186
What's going on?

28:47.978 --> 28:51.773
- No way! Daddy!
- I got you a new bike.

28:51.773 --> 28:55.027
The Capstones blessed it,
and I want you to patrol with me.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.653
I love it, Daddy.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.488
Jesus.

28:58.488 --> 29:01.033
- Go on. Hop on.
- Yes!

29:03.202 --> 29:04.203
Shit.

29:06.663 --> 29:09.833
Oh, my God.
I feel like me for the first time!

29:12.920 --> 29:15.297
Yeah! Crank that shit!

29:15.964 --> 29:18.634
All day, every day, bitches!

29:27.518 --> 29:28.560
Can't win 'em all, Pop.

29:29.811 --> 29:30.812
I know.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.693
I just feel for Markus and his family.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.988
They could run into Ochoa anytime.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.699
You think Ochoa and his wife were lying
about him being home...

29:43.951 --> 29:45.786
and that he really was the shooter?

29:46.745 --> 29:48.413
Especially with what Trini saw.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.376
Markus must feel so helpless.

29:54.545 --> 29:56.296
I know what that's like as a man.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.635
Devastating things happen
when you can't protect your loved ones.

30:03.846 --> 30:06.223
I don't blame you for any of it.

30:06.807 --> 30:10.143
It's when you put the blame
on yourself that wears at your soul.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.688
That's what Markus has to deal with.

30:12.688 --> 30:14.356
He'll never get
a good night's sleep again.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.567
You think he'll start drinking?

30:16.567 --> 30:18.986
Well, I just worry about him.
He's like a son to me.

30:22.072 --> 30:25.492
You should try to enjoy the party.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.169
Lil?

30:36.086 --> 30:37.421
Keep an eye on Daddy.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.631
Yeah, I always do.

31:11.747 --> 31:17.044
I gotta be honest, you know.
I'm struggling right now.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.381
I know, babe. Me too.

31:21.381 --> 31:22.466
No.

31:23.509 --> 31:24.510
I mean, I'm really...

31:26.929 --> 31:28.639
I'm really not handling shit well.

31:30.516 --> 31:32.643
You know, it's why I started drinking.

31:33.143 --> 31:34.978
It's why I damn near became a stalker.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.398
That's why I wasn't connecting with Trini.

31:38.398 --> 31:39.691
It's gonna be okay.

31:44.863 --> 31:46.323
I'm not so sure about that.

31:51.245 --> 31:55.791
Look, a couple of weeks ago,
I was with Poppy and--

31:57.751 --> 31:59.169
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

32:00.170 --> 32:01.421
What's the matter?

32:03.048 --> 32:04.174
My water broke.

32:04.716 --> 32:07.010
- My wa-- Yeah.
- What? Okay, okay.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.387
- Come on.
- It's go time.

32:08.387 --> 32:09.721
All right, it's go time.

32:14.893 --> 32:16.144
Goodness.

32:19.231 --> 32:21.191
Can I hold this sweet baby?

32:21.191 --> 32:23.110
- I'm taking her right now.
- Here you go.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.446
Here you go.

32:26.446 --> 32:27.614
Look at her.

32:28.532 --> 32:29.658
Look at this baby.

32:29.658 --> 32:30.576
Yeah.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.744
- She's so little.
- Wow, she's so beautiful.

32:34.329 --> 32:38.333
Hey. Hey, Skye.

32:38.333 --> 32:43.797
I want you to know
that I'm going to be the best big sister.

32:48.385 --> 32:49.970
What's the matter, baby?

32:53.015 --> 32:55.100
I think I wanna do the recovery program.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.603
The one in Wyoming? You're sure?

32:59.062 --> 33:02.441
I have to work on myself
if I wanna be a good sister.

33:03.859 --> 33:07.404
- But you guys aren't disappointed in me?
- No.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.615
For not testifying.
You don't think I'm weak?

33:10.741 --> 33:14.119
Your survival is your strength,
not whether or not you testify.

33:15.579 --> 33:17.122
- Okay?
- That's right.

33:17.122 --> 33:22.169
If anything, I'm disappointed in myself
for letting you and your mother down.

33:22.669 --> 33:25.380
Perfection isn't the goal, hon. Never was.

33:25.964 --> 33:29.468
You be the best you you can be,
whatever that means.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.762
Let me tell you something.

33:31.762 --> 33:34.056
- This little girl right here...
- Yeah.

33:34.056 --> 33:37.226
- ...is very lucky to have you as a sister.
- These toes!

33:40.771 --> 33:41.980
She looks just like you.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.149
- She's so little.
- That little nose.

33:45.651 --> 33:47.903
- I love you guys.
- Love you.

33:47.903 --> 33:49.530
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

33:49.530 --> 33:50.614
We love you too.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.117
If Ms. Pierre were here,

33:54.117 --> 33:57.579
her hope for each of you students
would be to nurture this garden.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.331
In doing so,

33:59.831 --> 34:03.168
you would acknowledge your own growth
and blossom.

34:04.253 --> 34:07.881
So today, I am honored
to usher in this beautiful garden,

34:07.881 --> 34:09.882
sponsored by Boisterous Media,

34:09.882 --> 34:13.428
to help us commemorate
the lives that we've lost.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.858
Drea would have loved it here.

34:30.237 --> 34:32.114
We're planting these all over,

34:33.364 --> 34:34.616
Rosa Andrea.

34:35.492 --> 34:36.534
That's beautiful.

34:39.246 --> 34:43.375
Thank you, Poppy. For everything.

34:54.303 --> 34:55.762
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.602
When I was a younger man,

35:01.602 --> 35:04.646
I never thought I'd be working with kids.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.399
They really seem to respond to you.

35:07.399 --> 35:10.360
Well, I am pretty cool.

35:10.986 --> 35:13.197
- You don't say.
- I do say.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.534
How's Trini?

35:17.534 --> 35:22.080
I think she's still
a little bit nervous around crowds.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.373
I don't blame her.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.919
That asshole, Ochoa,
gets to walk around like nothing happened.

35:31.381 --> 35:32.549
He killed Eva, didn't he?

35:33.675 --> 35:36.386
Yeah. But we can't prove it.

35:37.596 --> 35:38.847
It's so frustrating.

35:40.015 --> 35:42.017
I won't stop trying
to get justice for her.

35:42.684 --> 35:43.852
I promise.

35:44.895 --> 35:46.313
I'm gonna hold you to that.

35:46.897 --> 35:48.357
- You do that.
- I will.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.112
This is so beautiful.

35:56.532 --> 35:57.533
Yeah, it is.

36:05.624 --> 36:10.337
<i>The process of recovery
is a great undertaking.</i>

36:10.337 --> 36:15.843
For those who have been wounded,
time is required to heal.

36:17.261 --> 36:18.804
For those who have lost,

36:20.180 --> 36:23.767
a journey through grief must be taken.

36:23.767 --> 36:28.772
Oakland lost a beloved daughter
during this investigation,

36:29.731 --> 36:35.487
the principal of Oak Creek High School,
a dynamic woman named Eva Pierre.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.909
Recently, I interviewed her,

36:40.909 --> 36:43.620
and she shared with me

36:44.580 --> 36:48.250
her own experience being trafficked.

36:50.085 --> 36:54.590
<i>In the coming days,
you'll hear Eva's story.</i>

36:56.216 --> 37:00.971
<i>By telling it, she sheds light
on the darkest corners of our community.</i>

37:05.350 --> 37:06.435
- But...
- Eleven.

37:06.435 --> 37:09.479
...Eva's story is not one of trauma.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.524
It's of recovery.

37:14.401 --> 37:17.613
<i>Sometimes,
facing the truth is what we need</i>

37:18.155 --> 37:22.117
<i>to see who we are and who we can be.</i>

37:24.620 --> 37:28.165
<i>For some,
facing the truth about themselves</i>

37:28.165 --> 37:31.960
<i>results in justice
being served for others.</i>

37:32.794 --> 37:35.547
<i>Sybil Hackman, cofounder of Questeur,</i>

37:35.547 --> 37:39.718
built an empire buttressed by blackmail,

37:39.718 --> 37:42.262
coercion and exploitation.

37:42.846 --> 37:46.892
<i>She faces the rest of her life in prison,</i>

37:48.018 --> 37:51.939
because no one should benefit

37:52.439 --> 37:54.274
when children are exploited.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.987
<i>By trafficking young girls,
Sybil lost sight,</i>

37:58.987 --> 38:02.449
<i>not only of justice,
but of her own humanity.</i>

38:09.164 --> 38:10.749
<i>But the reality is,</i>

38:11.834 --> 38:17.172
<i>justice for some
does not mean justice for all.</i>

38:18.841 --> 38:21.593
You think you just go back,
live life like normal?

38:22.594 --> 38:25.055
- Who are you?
- I should blow your fucking head off.

38:26.431 --> 38:28.183
You leave this city for good.

38:29.977 --> 38:32.646
- I don't know what you think--
- You know what you did!

38:33.856 --> 38:35.148
Shit.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.179
You shouldn't have followed me.

39:05.762 --> 39:06.763
But I did.

39:09.266 --> 39:15.105
<i>I will continue to fight
to eradicate trafficking in Oakland.</i>

39:15.105 --> 39:16.190
Let's go.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.943
<i>For Oakland's children and for myself.</i>

39:21.278 --> 39:22.571
<i>Will you join me?</i>

39:24.615 --> 39:27.034
My name is Poppy Scoville,

39:28.202 --> 39:31.788
and I'd like you to reconsider.
