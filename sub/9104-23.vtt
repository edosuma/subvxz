00:40.720 --> 00:43.520
&lrm;I'm gonna be in a photo with Adrien.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.320
&lrm;Right... cus it's a class photo
&lrm;and you're in class with Adrien.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.920
&lrm;Amazing, isn't it?

00:50.680 --> 00:54.760
&lrm;Oh... my... gosh.
&lrm;What if we're in the same row together?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.360
&lrm;[giggling]
&lrm;Girl, you're too funny.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.680
&lrm;Just smile and whatever happens,
&lrm;don't forget to breathe.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.040
&lrm;At least you know
&lrm;you'll be in the photo.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.080
&lrm;No Juleka, I'm telling you,
&lrm;you're not jinxed.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.720
&lrm;This time it'll work out.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.840
&lrm;I can feel it... right here.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.440
&lrm;What's this about being jinxed?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.440
&lrm;[sighing]
&lrm;Ever since I was little,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.880
&lrm;every time someone takes
&lrm;a photo of me

01:16.040 --> 01:18.040
&lrm;something always goes very wrong.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.960
&lrm;You're wrong, Juleka, you'll see.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.200
&lrm;Sure. We'll do all we can
&lrm;to make sure it goes right.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.600
&lrm;Don't forget to smile.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.200
&lrm;Thank you, kids,
&lrm;you've been wonderful.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.200
&lrm;OK, time to flash

01:43.360 --> 01:44.440
&lrm;your pearly whites.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.560
&lrm;You, sit on the front bench.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.800
&lrm;Quickly please.
&lrm;I've 16 other classes to shoot.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.240
&lrm;[chattering]

01:57.400 --> 02:00.200
&lrm;Look Sabrina,
&lrm;they're up front in the baby seats.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.440
&lrm;Go on, rug rats,

02:01.600 --> 02:03.360
&lrm;don't forget to take your thumbs
&lrm;out of your mouths.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.840
&lrm;[photographer]
&lrm;Next row...

02:06.840 --> 02:08.720
&lrm;You, you, you, you and you.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.360
&lrm;Go sit in the rear bench.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.840
&lrm;Wait just a minute.
&lrm;I should be in the middle row,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.280
&lrm;next to Adrien,
&lrm;in the centre, look,

02:16.440 --> 02:17.480
&lrm;we're the same size.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.640
&lrm;No, go stand in the back row
&lrm;behind the rest.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.280
&lrm;How dare you put me behind the rest?

02:23.440 --> 02:26.320
&lrm;-Do you know who my father is?
&lrm;-Is he a photographer?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.760
&lrm;[gasping]
&lrm;No...

02:27.920 --> 02:28.800
&lrm;-He's...
&lrm;-Bummer,

02:28.960 --> 02:30.560
&lrm;I really need an assistant.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.920
&lrm;Now hurry up or I'll put you
&lrm;up front with "the babies".

02:34.080 --> 02:35.680
&lrm;[she groans]

02:39.080 --> 02:40.920
&lrm;You boys, go stand in the middle.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.280
&lrm;It's no big deal, Chloe.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.160
&lrm;As long as
&lrm;we're all on the same photo.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.240
&lrm;Perfect!

02:45.400 --> 02:46.440
&lrm;You guys are awesome.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.280
&lrm;Now stop squirming
&lrm;and let's get this photo shot.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.600
&lrm;Excuse me, sir.
&lrm;You forgot Juleka.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.960
&lrm;Sorry, my bad.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.480
&lrm;Go stand in the middle,
&lrm;next to that blond boy.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.720
&lrm;You'll be right in the centre.
&lrm;All eyes will be on you.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.720
&lrm;No more jinxed class photos.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.440
&lrm;This isn't right.
&lrm;Something's wrong.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.400
&lrm;Course it's not working.
&lrm;I'm in the wrong spot.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.880
&lrm;You... move over here, will ya?

03:22.040 --> 03:22.920
&lrm;Let's see.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.760
&lrm;Excuse me, do we have a problem?

03:33.120 --> 03:35.120
&lrm;[he sighs]
&lrm;It doesn't matter where I put him,

03:35.280 --> 03:36.680
&lrm;it throws the picture out of whack.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.160
&lrm;My spot is unacceptable!

03:40.800 --> 03:42.520
&lrm;That's right, Juleka.
&lrm;Don't let her push you out the way.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.560
&lrm;Miss Bourgeois, behave yourself.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.520
&lrm;Nobody asked you, loudmouth.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.320
&lrm;This isn't gym class, Chlo'.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.480
&lrm;You, over here...
&lrm;You, here.. and you... here.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.680
&lrm;There, perfect.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.880
&lrm;No... it isn't.
&lrm;It's not perfect at all.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.040
&lrm;I'm totally not next to Adrien.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.920
&lrm;Chloe, we still have
&lrm;16 classes to photograph.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.040
&lrm;Go ahead, Vincent.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.120
&lrm;Say spaghetti.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.120
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Spaghetti.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.360
&lrm;[moaning]
&lrm;I don't believe it.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.040
&lrm;I'm sorry,
&lrm;I have to fetch another battery.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.880
&lrm;Nobody move!

04:21.720 --> 04:25.200
&lrm;-Can I go to the bathroom?
&lrm;-Yes, Juleka, but hurry.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.760
&lrm;Miss Bustier, he said nobody move.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.520
&lrm;It's an emergency, Sir.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.440
&lrm;Make sure she...

04:32.600 --> 04:34.320
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;doesn't come back.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.360
&lrm;Miss Bustier,

04:35.520 --> 04:36.800
&lrm;I need to go too.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.480
&lrm;[she chuckles]

04:59.000 --> 05:00.400
&lrm;We're back in business.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.640
&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

05:03.800 --> 05:05.840
&lrm;What are you doing?
&lrm;Where's Juleka?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.200
&lrm;How did you get here?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.840
&lrm;Who cares?
&lrm;At last I'm in the right spot.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.960
&lrm;Flash me your best smiles.
&lrm;It's the last time we're doing this.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.080
&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

05:14.240 --> 05:15.160
&lrm;Wait!

05:17.360 --> 05:18.160
&lrm;Thanks, kids.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.720
&lrm;Wait, please, sir,
&lrm;we have to re-do the photo.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.160
&lrm;-Why?
&lrm;-Because Juleka's not in it.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.040
&lrm;Jula who?

05:24.200 --> 05:26.120
&lrm;Juleka, the tall one
&lrm;with purple streaks.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.640
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Yeah. Where'd she go?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.160
&lrm;Didn't she go to the bathroom?

05:29.320 --> 05:32.040
&lrm;Mr. Damocles,
&lrm;don't we need to be go to lunch?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.720
&lrm;And aren't you paying
&lrm;the photographer by the hour?

05:34.880 --> 05:36.600
&lrm;Yes, no time to re-take it.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.480
&lrm;Class, move along. Hurry up.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.800
&lrm;OK, lunch break.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.120
&lrm;[Rose]
&lrm;Juleka?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.160
&lrm;Juleka? Jule...

05:46.320 --> 05:48.360
&lrm;[sobbing]

05:50.560 --> 05:51.960
&lrm;Poor, sweet Juleka.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.160
&lrm;I missed the photo, didn't I?

05:57.320 --> 05:58.720
&lrm;Yeah, one of Chloe's tricks.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.040
&lrm;Why should I expect it
&lrm;to be different?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.600
&lrm;Nobody ever hears me or sees me.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.440
&lrm;I'm invisible... even in photos.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.640
&lrm;Don't say that, Juleka.
&lrm;It's not true.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.800
&lrm;Forget it.
&lrm;As long as Chloe's in the picture,

06:10.960 --> 06:12.680
&lrm;she'll find a way
&lrm;to keep me out of it.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.960
&lrm;No, wait, Juleka!

06:14.320 --> 06:15.800
&lrm;Really, Rose, forget it.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.160
&lrm;Forget me.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.040
&lrm;Poor girl,
&lrm;feeling so lonely and ignored.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.280
&lrm;How terrible it must be
&lrm;to feel you don't even exist.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.840
&lrm;Come here, my little friend.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.520
&lrm;Fly away, my evil Akuma,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.760
&lrm;and give this transparent soul
&lrm;a voice and a vision!

06:46.480 --> 06:48.720
&lrm;Juleka's been locked
&lrm;in the bathroom.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.400
&lrm;She really does have
&lrm;the "class photo jinx".

06:51.560 --> 06:54.080
&lrm;Of course, I should have known
&lrm;Chloe was behind this.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.200
&lrm;We have to break the curse, Rose.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.080
&lrm;-We can ask the photographer.
&lrm;-He won't want to.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.720
&lrm;Unless... If the photo disappeared,

07:01.880 --> 07:05.560
&lrm;they'll have to shoot another one...
&lrm;with Juleka.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.320
&lrm;You're a genius.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.680
&lrm;But why would the photo disappear?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.720
&lrm;You find Juleka,
&lrm;I'll take care of the rest.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.960
&lrm;She's not ruining
&lrm;my photo next to Adrien.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.440
&lrm;Think of something, fast.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.320
&lrm;Reflekta, I am Hawk Moth.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.520
&lrm;From now on,
&lrm;you will be the only one people see.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.040
&lrm;No-one will ever ignore you again.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.440
&lrm;However, you must do me a favour
&lrm;in return... when the time comes.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.760
&lrm;Yes, Hawk Moth.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.320
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;So...

07:50.480 --> 07:52.000
&lrm;the camera stays
&lrm;in the principal's office

07:52.160 --> 07:53.560
&lrm;during lunch break.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.960
&lrm;I refuse to be part of this.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.080
&lrm;There's no time.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.440
&lrm;We must break the "class photo jinx"
&lrm;before the photographer leaves.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.680
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;OK.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.440
&lrm;There must be
&lrm;another way, Marinette.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.280
&lrm;[footsteps approach]

08:23.960 --> 08:26.240
&lrm;I knew this wasn't a good idea.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.920
&lrm;Hello!

08:30.080 --> 08:32.120
&lrm;What? Who? Who are you?

08:32.280 --> 08:35.760
&lrm;Nobody has ever noticed me,
&lrm;but those days are over.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.760
&lrm;From now on,
&lrm;everybody will notice me,

08:38.919 --> 08:41.080
&lrm;because everyone will look like me.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.799
&lrm;Time to get a new look.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.200
&lrm;Soon there'll be nothing
&lrm;but Reflektas everywhere.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.080
&lrm;No need to panic.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.200
&lrm;Who doesn't love
&lrm;an extreme makeover?

09:03.040 --> 09:04.920
&lrm;Nobody leaves here!

09:11.720 --> 09:13.920
&lrm;Soon, all of Paris will
&lrm;look like me,

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
&lrm;including Miss Chloe Bourgeois.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.320
&lrm;[cackling]

09:18.960 --> 09:20.360
&lrm;Beautiful.

09:20.520 --> 09:25.120
&lrm;It won't be long before Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir show up to show their face.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.640
&lrm;[cackling]

09:27.800 --> 09:30.200
&lrm;Chloe Bourgeois?
&lrm;Have you seen Chloe Bourgeois?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.680
&lrm;[sobbing]

09:35.640 --> 09:36.920
&lrm;Time to transform.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.800
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

09:58.680 --> 09:59.640
&lrm;It's blocked.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.000
&lrm;Yo, check it!

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
&lrm;Cat Noir's gonna save us.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.800
&lrm;OK, change of plan.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.200
&lrm;Help us, Cat Noir.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.400
&lrm;I can't stand being in this body.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.440
&lrm;Cataclysm!

10:33.080 --> 10:34.440
&lrm;[Reflekta]
&lrm;Much better!

10:34.600 --> 10:36.280
&lrm;I hate cats.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.640
&lrm;Cataclysm!

10:39.560 --> 10:41.680
&lrm;My ring, my Miraculous... it's gone.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
&lrm;His Miraculous,

10:43.320 --> 10:45.640
&lrm;you should have taken it
&lrm;before you transformed him!

10:46.120 --> 10:48.280
&lrm;Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.280
&lrm;[she cackles]

10:51.160 --> 10:53.480
&lrm;Where is Chloe Bourgeois!

10:55.080 --> 10:57.440
&lrm;I know you're in here, Marinette.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.560
&lrm;Come out, now!

11:00.720 --> 11:01.760
&lrm;Hide, Tikki.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.320
&lrm;Caught red handed,
&lrm;Marinette Dupain-Cheng.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.760
&lrm;The principal will love

11:07.920 --> 11:09.880
&lrm;my video of you snooping around.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.960
&lrm;[Sabrina giggles]

11:13.120 --> 11:16.480
&lrm;Stop or the photo disappears,
&lrm;which would be a shame.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.720
&lrm;You look so good next to Adrien.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.840
&lrm;-No!
&lrm;-Hand it over, Chloe.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.920
&lrm;Give me that card.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.160
&lrm;Give me back my phone.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.960
&lrm;Give it me or I'll keep your phone.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.880
&lrm;You can keep it,

11:35.040 --> 11:36.440
&lrm;I'll buy another one.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.000
&lrm;[Reflekta shouts]
&lrm;Chloe! Where are you?

11:39.160 --> 11:40.520
&lrm;What was that?

11:40.680 --> 11:41.760
&lrm;Hey!

11:41.920 --> 11:44.120
&lrm;Don't just stand there, go get her!

11:47.240 --> 11:48.680
&lrm;Where's that pea-brain?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.920
&lrm;[cackling]

11:52.520 --> 11:54.400
&lrm;There you are, at last.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.400
&lrm;Chloe Bourgeois!

11:56.560 --> 11:58.280
&lrm;Who are you?

11:59.520 --> 12:02.360
&lrm;Take a good look,
&lrm;I'm your future face.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.560
&lrm;Gross.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.760
&lrm;What in the...

12:08.920 --> 12:11.240
&lrm;Do you realise
&lrm;how much my outfit cost?

12:11.400 --> 12:15.120
&lrm;You should thank me.
&lrm;You look much better like this.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.840
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;[Marinette gasps]

12:19.120 --> 12:21.120
&lrm;Time to transform, Tikki.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.400
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

12:39.080 --> 12:42.040
&lrm;You won't get rid of me
&lrm;by locking me in the bathroom.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.720
&lrm;[Ladybug gasps]
&lrm;Juleka?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.000
&lrm;Juleka, stop this now!

12:46.160 --> 12:49.080
&lrm;I'm not the Juleka
&lrm;nobody notices anymore.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.840
&lrm;Now, I am the unmistakable Reflekta!

12:53.600 --> 12:57.080
&lrm;Before you transform Ladybug,
&lrm;take her Miraculous, the earrings.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.360
&lrm;I'm sure you'll love
&lrm;your new image, Ladybug.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.160
&lrm;Thanks, but no thanks.
&lrm;I prefer the one I've got.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.920
&lrm;You sure? Ask Cat Noir.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.400
&lrm;I'm sure he loves his new look.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.480
&lrm;My powers might be gone
&lrm;but I can't stand by and do nothing.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.680
&lrm;Who invented these things?

13:33.040 --> 13:34.760
&lrm;If you want
&lrm;your faces back, listen.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.320
&lrm;Heard of safety in numbers?

13:53.960 --> 13:58.040
&lrm;Soon, like everyone else,
&lrm;you'll look just like me!

13:58.200 --> 13:59.120
&lrm;But first,

13:59.280 --> 14:02.120
&lrm;I'm going to take
&lrm;your earrings as a trophy.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.000
&lrm;Time to face off!

14:07.720 --> 14:08.880
&lrm;Catch her!

14:09.040 --> 14:10.920
&lrm;[Mob yells]

14:14.160 --> 14:16.400
&lrm;You're no match for me, Ladybug.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.520
&lrm;This will all be over soon for you!

14:20.360 --> 14:21.920
&lrm;[Rose]
&lrm;Are you going to help us?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.240
&lrm;[Nino]
&lrm;We want our faces back.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.720
&lrm;Don't worry, I'll figure it out.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.000
&lrm;Yeah, these shoes kill, milady.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.280
&lrm;Cat Noir?

14:28.440 --> 14:30.040
&lrm;Excuse us. Out of the way.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.280
&lrm;Cat Noir... is it really you?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.640
&lrm;Of course.
&lrm;Can't you tell by my swagger?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.560
&lrm;Am I still the cat's meow?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.000
&lrm;I... don't know what to say.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.200
&lrm;How about a thank you?

14:43.680 --> 14:46.960
&lrm;Sorry Cat Noir, but you...
&lrm;you just don't look yourself.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.200
&lrm;But... thank you.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.440
&lrm;You're welcome.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.400
&lrm;In case you forgot,
&lrm;we've gotta de-akumatise Reflekta.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.840
&lrm;We? Your powers are gone.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.160
&lrm;Are you gonna throw
&lrm;your shoes at her?

14:56.320 --> 14:57.400
&lrm;[she giggles]

14:57.560 --> 14:59.240
&lrm;Who just saved you?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.680
&lrm;I have to find Reflekta.
&lrm;You'd slow me down.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.440
&lrm;Maybe, but you know...
&lrm;sometimes I do have ideas.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.280
&lrm;Ok, yeah, sorry... And?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.680
&lrm;Taking on Reflekta
&lrm;face to face isn't the best idea

15:10.840 --> 15:11.920
&lrm;unless you want a facelift too.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.360
&lrm;You're right.
&lrm;And that gives me an idea.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.640
&lrm;Where we headed?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.040
&lrm;To the TV station.
&lrm;Here goes.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.440
&lrm;Watch your nails.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.600
&lrm;Your jokes are so lame.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.360
&lrm;You haven't just lost your body,

15:27.520 --> 15:29.440
&lrm;you've lost
&lrm;your sense of humour too.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.800

<i>&lrm;Reflekta is not invincible.</i>

16:04.200 --> 16:06.720
<i>&lrm;You can help.</i>
<i>&lrm;Just put on a disguise.</i>

16:06.880 --> 16:09.880
<i>&lrm;Then I'll spot the real Reflekta</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:20.320
&lrm;Now why would you say that

16:20.480 --> 16:22.880
&lrm;when she's just given away
&lrm;her secrets?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.000
&lrm;Ladybug will save us.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
&lrm;Ladybug won't be saving anybody.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.720
&lrm;Don't let Ladybug
&lrm;get away this time

&lrm;[Cat Noir]

16:39.960 --> 16:42.720
&lrm;Sorry but isn't your plan
&lrm;a bit complicated?

16:42.880 --> 16:45.160
&lrm;It's not my real plan.
&lrm;The real plan is

16:45.320 --> 16:47.760
&lrm;now that Reflekta knows
&lrm;we're at the TV station,

16:47.920 --> 16:49.400
&lrm;she'll come to get us.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.000
&lrm;And fall into our claws.

&lrm;You might have pulled
&lrm;it off today, Ladybug,

&lrm;but everything isn't always
&lrm;as it seems.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.560
&lrm;Watch out Ladybug,

19:27.720 --> 19:31.000
&lrm;I'll destroy you
&lrm;when you least expect it.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.240
&lrm;You were right, Tikki.
&lrm;Stealing this was wrong.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.360
&lrm;You won't erase the photo?

19:42.520 --> 19:46.160
&lrm;No, I've got another idea
&lrm;which I think you'll approve of.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
&lrm;That's my girl.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.800

&lrm;but a girl wasn't
&lrm;in the photo you took.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.960
&lrm;Can we do it again?

20:13.360 --> 20:15.360
&lrm;Well... I'm already running late,

20:15.520 --> 20:18.040

&lrm;Mr. Damocles.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.720
&lrm;I understand but...
&lrm;could you do it after school?

20:23.880 --> 20:25.600
&lrm;We could do it in the park.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.240
&lrm;Well...

20:27.400 --> 20:30.280
&lrm;We want an awesome photo
&lrm;by the best photographer.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.400
&lrm;Please.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.480
&lrm;Well, when you put it that way,

20:33.640 --> 20:34.760
&lrm;OK!

20:36.560 --> 20:38.920
&lrm;OK, we're all good here.
&lrm;Ready?

20:39.080 --> 20:40.880
&lrm;This was a good idea, Marinette.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.880
&lrm;Thanks, Adrien.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.160
&lrm;Like I'd want to be part
&lrm;of their stupid photo anyway.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.960
&lrm;Ridiculous... utterly ridiculous.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.440
&lrm;The "class photo curse" is broken.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.080
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.
