WEBVTT

00:17.800 --> 00:19.280
[burps]

00:20.672 --> 00:22.283
[exhales]

00:24.850 --> 00:26.765
[spritzing]

00:29.377 --> 00:30.378
[exhales]

00:32.380 --> 00:33.337
Hi. I'’m Bonnie.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.469
I'’m an alcoholic.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.646
[high-pitched]:
Hi. I'’m Bonnie.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.561
I'’m an alcoholic.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.345
[Cockney accent]:
'’Ello, '’ello, '’ello.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.521
My name is Bonnie
and I'’m fond of the grape.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.307
[laughs]

00:46.394 --> 00:47.264
Ooh!

00:49.092 --> 00:50.006
What are you doing?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.616
Hey, there.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.531
I'’ll be right in.
I'’m... praying.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.620
Would you like me to join you?

00:55.707 --> 00:57.057
Sure, if you don'’t mind swearing

00:57.144 --> 00:59.711
your eternal allegiance
to Satan.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.844
I'’ll see you inside.

01:05.021 --> 01:08.024
Whew.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.940
Hi. I'’m Bonnie and
I'’m an alcoholic!

01:12.942 --> 01:17.381
And today, I am sober 18 months!

01:18.469 --> 01:19.818
18 months, bitches!

01:21.255 --> 01:23.257
Is she wearing
two different shoes?

01:23.344 --> 01:25.172
Maybe it'’s to match her
two different earrings.

01:26.912 --> 01:30.612
I gotta tell you,
I could not have made it

01:30.699 --> 01:33.093
without the support of
the men and women in this room.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.880
I just... [inhales]
love you guys so much.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.316
Even you, Regina.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.801
I swore I wasn'’t gonna cry.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.499
Come on, Plunkett,
pull it together.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.284
[sobs]

01:50.371 --> 01:52.068
What are you crying for?

01:52.155 --> 01:54.331
I don'’t know.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.118
Anyway...

01:58.205 --> 02:00.381
it'’s time for me to give back.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.731
To share my experience,

02:02.818 --> 02:03.949
my strength,

02:04.036 --> 02:06.213
my hope, with the people who are

02:06.300 --> 02:10.782
taking their first steps on this
wonderful road we call...

02:12.175 --> 02:15.961
...not drinking.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.963
Avenue.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.489
Thank you.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.404
Nobody calls it that.
Do we call it that?

02:43.728 --> 02:45.382
REGINA:
Don'’t get me wrong--

02:45.469 --> 02:48.646
I feel blessed to live
in Jill'’s beautiful home.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.648
But every time her friends
come for a visit,

02:50.735 --> 02:52.520
they hand me their coat.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.175
I told you it'’s not
because you'’re black,

02:55.262 --> 02:57.568
it'’s because you look
like my old maid.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.048
How is that better?

02:59.135 --> 03:00.832
Is that better?

03:00.919 --> 03:03.444
Her old maid was very pretty.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.187
Gotta pee.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.145
Hey. I'’m wearing
two different shoes.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.628
Is your mom doing okay?

03:13.715 --> 03:14.977
Yeah. Why?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.761
She doesn'’t seem like herself.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.241
What'’s "herself"?

03:18.328 --> 03:19.503
Mean...Bitchy...

03:19.590 --> 03:20.852
Dismissive...Okay.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.289
Rude...
Selfish...

03:22.376 --> 03:25.205
Condescending...I get it! I get it!

03:25.292 --> 03:27.381
She'’s not taking
those pain pills

03:27.468 --> 03:29.078
for her back
anymore, is she?

03:29.165 --> 03:31.863
No, the prescription ran
out a couple weeks ago.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.735
Well... something'’s
not right there.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.040
Oh, come on!

03:35.127 --> 03:36.738
After the year she'’s had,

03:36.825 --> 03:38.566
she'’s allowed to be
a little eccentric.

03:38.653 --> 03:39.784
The year she'’s had?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.351
Did she spend time in jail?

03:41.438 --> 03:43.310
Is she fighting cancer?

03:43.397 --> 03:46.313
Did her hair guy move back
to Japan with zero warning?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.923
Oh, please.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.707
That'’s the same haircut
I give my son.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.320
BONNIE: I know they'’re
two different shoes!

03:53.407 --> 03:55.060
Mind your freakin'’ business!

03:56.584 --> 03:58.629
See? She'’s still mean.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.198
I think the real problem is

04:02.285 --> 04:04.200
that she'’s lonely.

04:04.287 --> 04:07.072
Do any of you guys know somebody
we could set her up with?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.857
Does it have to be a man?

04:08.944 --> 04:10.902
Not really.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.340
She'’s been known to eat from
both sides of the buffet.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.214
Think I'’m gonna take off.
I'’m tired.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.695
We just got our food.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.087
Oh, right.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.787
That was mine.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.575
So what do you think?

04:31.662 --> 04:33.229
Eh, we could toss
a penny in there

04:33.316 --> 04:35.536
and wish for it to unclog.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.798
Did you try using a plunger?

04:36.885 --> 04:38.103
First thing I did.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.801
Hmm. You'’re not flushing any

04:39.888 --> 04:41.498
feminine hygiene products
down there, are you?

04:41.585 --> 04:43.108
I'’m 58 years old.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.327
What kind of
feminine hygiene products

04:44.414 --> 04:46.416
do you think I'’m using?

04:46.503 --> 04:50.028
Don'’t bark at me for thinking
you might still be vital.

04:51.595 --> 04:52.770
All right,
I'’ll take a look.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.337
Thank you.By the way...

04:54.424 --> 04:55.773
if you know
you'’re having company,

04:55.860 --> 04:57.819
maybe you could put
your bras away?

04:57.906 --> 05:00.038
You'’re not company.
You'’re here to fix the toilet.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.476
Well, I still don'’t need to see
those tired old things.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.609
Though they pair nicely
with those tired old things.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.612
Just fix the toilet
and let yourself out.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.571
No hug?

05:15.053 --> 05:16.272
Well, there'’s the problem.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.187
She'’s got a tired old ballcock.

05:26.935 --> 05:27.979
Ah, let'’s see...

05:31.069 --> 05:32.593
Stuff to help you poop.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.421
Stuff to make
the pooping stop.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.031
Well, now we know why
the toilet'’s clogged.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.991
Hold on.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.950
Chlorodiazepoxide.

05:43.604 --> 05:44.866
It'’s gotta be good.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.351
Hey, did you hear from
Marjorie today?

05:51.438 --> 05:52.917
She sent me an e-mail.
I didn'’t open it.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.746
What is this stuff?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.313
It'’s tofu.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.445
What'’s tofu?

05:58.532 --> 05:59.837
A type of chicken.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.364
I like chicken.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
Hey, I gotta talk
to your grandma.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.324
Why don'’t you go
watch TV while you eat?

06:08.411 --> 06:09.325
Okay.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.502
I wonder what part of
the chicken this is.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.552
Why didn'’t you open it?

06:18.639 --> 06:20.162
Because she sends me
her happy thought e-mails

06:20.249 --> 06:21.511
every freakin'’ day.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.383
Listen to this gem.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.995
"If God brings ya to it,
God'’ll bring ya through it."

06:29.519 --> 06:31.695
Gee... I like those e-mails.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.654
They keep me from stabbing you.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.660
Anyway, the reason she'’s
trying to get ahold of you is,

06:39.747 --> 06:42.184
she has a really nice guy
she wants you to meet.
Yuck.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.794
You know who else
was a nice guy?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.013
The Elephant Man.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.667
Oh, come on!

06:46.754 --> 06:49.060
Watch the movie--
he was charming.

06:49.147 --> 06:53.195
Yeah, well, I checked out
Marjorie'’s guy on Facebook,

06:53.282 --> 06:55.066
and he happens to be
good-looking

06:55.153 --> 06:57.199
and a very
successful dentist.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.809
A dentist? Huh. Hmm.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.158
Yep.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.943
Oh, come on, give it a try!

07:02.030 --> 07:04.336
You need to get out there
and have some fun.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.991
Who knows?
Maybe you two will hit it off

07:07.078 --> 07:08.602
and he'’ll fill your cavity.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.693
Your cavity.

07:12.780 --> 07:13.868
Get it?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.698
Do a little drillin'’?

07:17.785 --> 07:20.918
I'’m gonna go eat with Roscoe.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.920
I'’ll be here all week!

07:23.007 --> 07:24.052
Tip your waitress!

07:26.576 --> 07:28.360
So, after my wife died,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.101
I thought I'’d travel
a little bit.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.234
Took a cruise up to Alaska.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.278
Nice.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.019
Walked on a glacier.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.760
Saw a pod of whales.

07:36.847 --> 07:37.848
Wow!

07:37.935 --> 07:39.676
Met some Inuits.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.722
They'’re one of
the local Indian tribes.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.332
[wry chuckle]

07:43.419 --> 07:45.900
Not to be confused
with the Out-u-its.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.642
Sorry?

07:48.729 --> 07:51.253
A joke that the
cruise comedian did.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.385
I don'’t think
I told it right.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.693
Ow!

07:56.780 --> 07:58.042
You all right?

07:58.129 --> 07:59.566
Yeah, yeah, I just
have this...

07:59.653 --> 08:01.306
sensitive tooth back here.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.178
I gotta remember to
chew on the other side.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.222
Oh...

08:04.309 --> 08:06.442
So... the Inuits. Go on.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.400
Why don'’t we go back
to my office,

08:08.488 --> 08:09.706
let me take a look?

08:09.793 --> 08:11.142
I don'’t want to impose.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.667
Mm!

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
Think I'’ll stick with
the mashed potatoes.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.801
Don'’t be silly.
I insist.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.543
Oh... you'’re very sweet,
but... [sighs]

08:20.630 --> 08:23.459
to be totally honest,
I'’m terrified of dentists.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.156
I have no tolerance for pain.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.071
I promise
you won'’t feel a thing.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.421
I'’ll give you
a little nitrous oxide.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.466
Let'’s go.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.121
[knocking]

08:35.645 --> 08:37.647
Where'’s your mother?

08:37.734 --> 08:39.562
Um...

08:39.649 --> 08:41.607
Out for the evening.
Why?

08:41.695 --> 08:44.306
She stole three of
my cat'’s tranquilizers.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.829
What?

08:45.916 --> 08:47.265
That'’s impossible.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.919
I just refilled
his prescription.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.921
I know exactly
how many were in here.

08:51.008 --> 08:54.490
Maybe your cat
has a drug problem.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.405
So this is funny to you?

08:56.492 --> 08:58.407
A little.

08:58.494 --> 09:01.323
I mean, a cat
on tranquilizers...

09:01.410 --> 09:04.848
at some point,
isn'’t that just a pillow?

09:04.935 --> 09:06.981
You'’re just as bad as she is.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.507
I'’ll save a seat for
your cat at my AA meeting!

09:13.378 --> 09:14.902
My name is Mittens
and I'’m an alcoholic.

09:15.990 --> 09:16.904
[hisses]

09:19.602 --> 09:21.473
So how'’d your wife die?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.694
Massive heart attack.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.741
The love of my life
died the same way.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.179
[both spluttering, laughing]

09:34.965 --> 09:37.228
Oh, I loved him so much.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.100
[laughing]:
I loved her, too.

09:39.187 --> 09:42.494
[both laughing]

09:42.582 --> 09:44.496
My friend has cancer.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.239
[both guffawing]

09:48.326 --> 09:51.895
I haven'’t spoken to
my daughter in 15 years.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.550
[laughs]

09:54.637 --> 09:56.900
[sighs]

09:56.987 --> 09:58.554
[chuckles]

09:58.641 --> 10:00.861
[both laughing]

10:03.124 --> 10:04.691
What? What?

10:04.778 --> 10:07.389
Out-u-its.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.414
Hey, how was your date?

10:32.501 --> 10:34.024
Not bad.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.157
It'’s 12:30.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.420
I'’m guessing the Elephant Man
had a trunk in his pants.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.641
Nothing happened,
and he was very nice.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.816
Details, details.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.992
Not much to tell, really.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.472
He'’s a widower, so we talked
a lot about losing loved ones.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.737
Sounds depressing.We actually found a way
to laugh about it.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.740
Here, free
toothbrushes.

10:53.827 --> 10:54.958
Oh, good.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.133
Now I can stop using yours.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.961
What?

10:58.048 --> 10:59.223
You heard me.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.838
So did you make plans
to see him again,

11:04.925 --> 11:07.101
or is he just gonna
send you a postcard?

11:07.188 --> 11:09.059
Good night.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.235
Hey, um, just
a heads-up.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.063
Beverly Torantino dropped by.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.586
Oh, yeah?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.066
She was pretty upset.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.415
About?

11:17.502 --> 11:19.461
She has this crazy idea

11:19.548 --> 11:22.290
that you stole some
of her cat'’s tranquilizers.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.596
Her cat has tranquilizers?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.815
That'’s weird.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.077
That'’s what I thought.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.905
I don'’t know what to say.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.951
How about you say
you didn'’t take '’em?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.301
Wait, you'’re actually asking me

11:33.388 --> 11:36.957
if I snagged downers
from Garfield?

11:37.044 --> 11:39.002
Well, to be fair,

11:39.089 --> 11:41.483
you are not unfamiliar with
taking other people'’s drugs.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.354
Yeah, keyword, "people."

11:43.441 --> 11:45.487
And that was a long time ago,
and it was business.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.794
You know how hard it is
to be a single mom.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.317
I know, but...

11:49.404 --> 11:51.145
Stop. Just stop.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.147
I am so hurt that
you would actually believe

11:53.234 --> 11:55.366
I'’d be capable of doing
something like that.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.281
I'’m sorry, it'’s just--
you'’ve been acting...

11:57.368 --> 11:59.022
What? I'’ve been acting what?

11:59.109 --> 12:01.111
I don'’t know, squirrelly.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.634
Oh, I'’m squirrelly?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.375
Which one of us
gambled away the rent?

12:04.462 --> 12:05.942
Which one of us
shacked up with her boss?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.509
Which one of us
is sitting here

12:07.596 --> 12:09.206
nervously filling her cheeks
with nuts?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.210
Don'’t turn this around on me.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.256
You know what the worst part is?

12:15.343 --> 12:18.738
I spent the whole night bragging
about my extraordinary daughter

12:18.825 --> 12:21.958
and how much
our relationship had healed.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.307
Thanks for making
me a liar.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.613
Mom, please,
I'’m sorry.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.962
I don'’t want
to hear it.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.964
Cat tranquilizers,
unbelievable.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.618
I said I was sorry!

12:29.705 --> 12:31.968
I believe you!

12:34.449 --> 12:35.842
BONNIE:
Forgot my purse.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.147
Here you go.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.415
What?

12:44.502 --> 12:45.982
Really?

12:46.069 --> 12:47.810
With your cholesterol?Don'’t start.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.812
It'’s just-- you were
so good all weekend.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.553
Then I'’ve earned this.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.381
Fine, die young.

12:53.468 --> 12:56.297
Leave me in that
big house all alone.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.821
We have a year to give
you two a gift, right?

13:00.431 --> 13:02.172
You won'’t
believe this.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.565
What?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.567
The dentist I fixed
your mom up with

13:05.654 --> 13:07.874
just checked himself
into Betty Ford.

13:07.961 --> 13:11.138
22 years of sobriety
down the toilet.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.661
Oh, God.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.576
She went to dinner
with him last night.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.447
How was she
when she came home?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.536
She was in a great mood--
bubbly, chatty and...

13:18.623 --> 13:20.495
Oh, I am such
an idiot.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.890
Not your fault.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.893
One of the neighbors came
over and accused her

13:26.980 --> 13:29.199
of stealing her
cat'’s tranquilizers.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.853
Cats have tranquilizers?

13:30.940 --> 13:32.507
Oh, yeah.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.030
Wash '’em down with
a dry chardonnay.

13:34.117 --> 13:34.988
Meow.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.730
[sighing]:
Oh, God, Mom.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.907
Seems we have
a situation here.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.647
Hey, guys.

13:44.867 --> 13:45.955
What?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.304
We need to talk.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.479
Okay, just give me a minute.

13:48.566 --> 13:49.741
I think I left my lights on.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.833
She'’s not coming
back, is she?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.967
Mom, wait.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.621
No, I don'’t think so.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.319
[car horn honks, tires screech]

14:02.406 --> 14:03.930
[car horns honking]

14:06.410 --> 14:08.021
Wow, she'’s fast!

14:08.108 --> 14:10.762
She'’s all legs,
and she'’s on drugs!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.895
Mom, wait!

14:12.982 --> 14:13.896
Bonnie!

14:13.983 --> 14:15.593
CHRISTY:
Mom!

14:15.680 --> 14:16.986
Where are
you going?!

14:17.073 --> 14:18.335
Bonnie, stop!

14:20.729 --> 14:22.339
[panting]

14:24.167 --> 14:25.342
You all right?

14:25.429 --> 14:26.691
Yeah, go on, I'’m fine.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.823
I'’ll stay here
with her

14:27.910 --> 14:29.303
in case Bonnie
doubles back.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.261
That'’s the cream cheese talking!

14:33.611 --> 14:35.526
JILL:
Bonnie!

14:35.613 --> 14:37.485
CHRISTY:
Mom, please!

14:40.488 --> 14:43.056
Oh, my God.

14:52.456 --> 14:55.024
Mom, stop!

14:55.111 --> 14:57.374
What are you doing?

14:57.461 --> 14:59.246
Go away![sighs]

14:59.333 --> 15:00.638
Come on.

15:00.725 --> 15:01.988
Let me help you.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.337
I don'’t need
your help.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.295
I'’ve got it under control.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.690
How is this having it
under control?

15:08.777 --> 15:09.996
Don'’t make me jump.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.606
I swear I will jump.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.043
Go ahead.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.436
The ground is rubber.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.920
Just leave me alone.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.533
You know what?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.710
Fine.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.494
Have a nice life.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.585
What'’s that supposed to mean?

15:36.283 --> 15:38.546
It means you and me are through.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.027
What are you talking about?
I'’m your mother.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.333
You'’re a crazy old woman
on top of a jungle gym.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.639
Old?!

15:44.726 --> 15:46.510
I outran you.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.819
You looked me right in the eye,
and you lied to me.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.516
You lied
to everybody!

15:52.603 --> 15:54.866
Well, maybe I don'’t want
to be sober anymore!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.694
Maybe I'’m done with that!

15:58.174 --> 16:00.089
Fine.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.135
But you'’re also done with me,

16:02.222 --> 16:04.137
and you'’re done
with your grandchildren.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.094
Christy...

16:08.184 --> 16:12.014
I'’ll still see my grandson when
he comes to play in the park!

16:18.325 --> 16:19.543
You doing okay, hon?

16:19.630 --> 16:21.545
I'’m fine.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.333
Walking away was the
right thing to do.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.291
I know.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.467
You'’re not responsible
for Bonnie'’s sobriety.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.296
I get it.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.476
It'’s just...

16:39.563 --> 16:42.175
I can'’t believe
she threw it all away.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.569
Honey, she'’s
an alcoholic.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.528
She'’s my mom.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.881
Yeah, well, you got to
separate those two out.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.191
That'’s real easy
for you to say, but...

17:00.497 --> 17:02.369
...she'’s not
your mother.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.935
And...

17:06.199 --> 17:09.115
...like an idiot,

17:09.202 --> 17:11.638
I thought she was finally mine.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.126
What'’d I miss?

17:28.176 --> 17:30.310
[cell phone buzzes]

17:34.575 --> 17:35.837
Hello?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.186
BONNIE:
Christy.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.188
[sighs]
Where are you?

17:39.275 --> 17:40.537
Uh...

17:40.624 --> 17:42.496
uh, I'’m in jail.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.194
Oh, God.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.543
Are you okay?

17:46.630 --> 17:49.546
Yeah, just got a DUI.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.506
Can you come bail me out?

17:52.593 --> 17:53.985
Yeah.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.031
J-Just so you know--

17:56.118 --> 17:57.772
I was fine to drive.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.383
The cop was just a jerk
trying to fill her quota.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.434
So it'’s the cop'’s fault?

18:07.521 --> 18:09.784
[sighs]
I can'’t say it loud, but...

18:09.871 --> 18:12.091
[whispers]:
she'’s an angry lesbian.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.099
You know what, I'’ll come get you
in the morning.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.318
What?

18:22.405 --> 18:24.494
You'’re gonna leave me here?

18:24.581 --> 18:25.843
Yeah, I am, Mom.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.454
Christy, don'’t you dare...

18:39.118 --> 18:40.989
[cries]
