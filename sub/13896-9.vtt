06:24.510 --> 06:26.510
WELL, NO. IT'S NOT

SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE.

06:27.510 --> 06:28.930
ANYWAY, HE COMES IN HERE

06:28.970 --> 06:31.720
AND HE GETS HIS PICTURE TAKEN
WITH ONE OF THE GUYS,

06:31.760 --> 06:33.260
AND THEN HE PULLS OUT A GUN.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.600
STARTS WAVING IT AROUND.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.680
TRIES TO ROB THE PLACE.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.560
SO WHAT, YOU HIT HIM THEN?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.770
AND YOU DIDN'T CALL

HE HIT HIMSELF, WENT DOWN,
AND THEN A GUY COMES IN

06:49.660 --> 06:51.240
AND JUST DRAGS HIM OUTTA HERE.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.490
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD

06:53.530 --> 06:56.910

07:12.680 --> 07:15.140

07:17.930 --> 07:19.100
WAVING GUNS AROUND.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.980
THEY GET THROWN
OUTTA THE BAR,

07:21.020 --> 07:24.020
AND LOOK WHAT'S DIRECTLY

07:24.070 --> 07:25.480
THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.610
THAT DES TRIED TO ROB.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.240

07:31.280 --> 07:33.240
HEY! HEY, YOU CAME TO SEE ME!

I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.290
ARE YOU ON SOMETHING?

07:44.340 --> 07:45.550
DID YOU TAKE SOMETHING
LAST NIGHT?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.710
NO, NO, I SWEAR. I-I DON'T
EVEN LIKE COLD PILLS.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.050
THEY MAKE MY TEETH ITCHY.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.220
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

NOTHING. I-I SWEAR.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.560
I LOOKED IT UP.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.020
YOU COULD GET
TEN YEARS FOR THIS!

08:04.060 --> 08:05.310
THIS COULD RUIN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!

08:05.360 --> 08:07.530
WELL, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WON'T HAPPEN,

08:07.570 --> 08:09.240
BECAUSE THE CHARGES
WILL NEVER STICK.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.360
THEY HAVE YOU ON TAPE.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.740
IT COULD BE A FAKE,
COULD BE A FAKE.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.120
IT COULD BE PHOTOSHOP.
MY HEAD ON SOMEONE
ELSE'S BODY.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.870
THAT'LL NEVER HOLD UP
IN COURT.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.750
I'M KILLING MYSELF,
I'M KILLING MYSELF, I KEEP...

08:21.790 --> 08:24.540

08:35.640 --> 08:36.800
OR WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE HERE!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.220
I JUST KEEP THINKING THAT...

08:40.100 --> 08:42.600
MAYBE I DID IT BECAUSE...

08:42.640 --> 08:43.810
BECAUSE I LIKED IT.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.480
LIKE, WHAT IF I DO IT AGAIN?

08:46.520 --> 08:49.070
I MEAN MAYBE,

08:50.740 --> 08:54.610
MAYBE, I'M A
CRIMINAL MASTERMIND.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.160
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; YEAH,

SECOND HE WALKED
IN THE STORE

09:41.660 --> 09:42.910
I COULD TELL HE WAS TROUBLE.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.460
I MEAN, I HAD
A CUSTOMER IN HERE.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.540
HE DIDN'T CARE.
HE JUST WALTZES ON IN.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.630
WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE
WITH HIM, LIKE A FRIEND MAYBE?

09:49.670 --> 09:51.630
NO, HE WAS BY HIMSELF,

09:51.670 --> 09:53.590
AND HE WAS AS HIGH AS A KITE.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.090
ANYWAY, SOON AS
HE PULLS OUT THE GUN,

09:55.130 --> 09:57.090
I PRESS THE BUTTON, 911.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.220
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

09:58.260 --> 10:00.350
"COPS ARE ON THE WAY,"
I TELL HIM.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.720
THEN HE STARTS FALLING
ALL OVER THE CHIP RACK,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.770
SO I, UH... HIT 'EM
WITH THE BROOM.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.770
-THEN HE WENT OUTSIDE?
-YEAH,

10:05.810 --> 10:06.940
EXCEPT THE VAN,
IT TOOK OFF.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.810
IT LEFT HIM STANDING THERE
ON THE SIDEWALK.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.730
WHAT VAN?

10:10.770 --> 10:12.400
THE GETAWAY VAN?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.320
I KNOW. SOME FRIEND, RIGHT?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.320
SO, YOUR BUDDY,
HE DODGES ACROSS THE STREET

10:16.360 --> 10:18.490
AND HE JUMPS INTO
THIS BLUE MUSCLE CAR,

10:18.530 --> 10:20.910
TAKES OFF JUST
AS THE COPS ARRIVE.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.490
THERE'S A BIG CHASE.
TOTALLY COOL!

10:24.660 --> 10:25.870
WHOLE TIME THAT GUY,

10:25.910 --> 10:27.750
HE NEVER TOOK OFF
HIS S.C.U.B.A. MASK!

10:27.790 --> 10:29.210
NOT ONCE!

10:30.750 --> 10:32.250
MADNESS.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.460
ALL RIGHT. THANKS A LOT.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.720
-THANKS, SHIRLEY.
-NO TROUBLE.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.050
IT'S JUST SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.850
I MEAN IN PERSON.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.850
NOT JUST TALKING ON THE PHONE.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.730
IT'S NICE. IT'S TRUE.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.860
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
MAYBE WE MADE A...

10:50.900 --> 10:52.110
A WRONG MOVE SOMEWHERE.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.770
MAYBE I MADE THE WRONG MOVE.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.900
[MAL] SO DES HAD A FRIEND
WITH HIM, GOES INTO THE STORE,

10:57.950 --> 10:59.910
BUT HE TAKES OFF
BEFORE DES FINISHES THE JOB?

10:59.950 --> 11:02.580
SO, WE GOT TO FIND
THIS FRIEND.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.700
HEY, WHO'S THAT WITH
YOUR LADY LAWYER FRIEND?

11:06.790 --> 11:08.250
I DUNNO.

11:08.290 --> 11:10.170
I'LL MEET YA UPSTAIRS.

11:10.210 --> 11:11.790
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE,
SIMON, OKAY?

11:11.830 --> 11:12.710
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.300
HEY.

11:18.760 --> 11:19.680
HI.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.800
EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.430
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.060
WHO'S DAPPER DAN OVER THERE?

11:27.810 --> 11:30.850
JUST, UH, SOMETHING
I NEED TO SORT OUT.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.400
LOOK, I DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.730
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU. I JUST...

11:34.770 --> 11:37.030
RELAX. IT'S FINE.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.740
THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.240
LOOK, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUS...

11:45.990 --> 11:49.040
IT'S JUST PERSONAL TO ME,
AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.580
I JUST...

11:50.620 --> 11:52.370
I NEED A LITTLE
BIT OF TIME, OKAY?

11:53.290 --> 11:54.790
OKAY.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.750
I HEARD ABOUT DES. I'M SORRY.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.090
YEAH, UM...

12:01.130 --> 12:03.010
DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE
THAT SURVEILLANCE TAPE?

12:03.510 --> 12:04.600
YEAH.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.060
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION
TO ALL OF THIS.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.230
I GOTTA GO.
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?

12:13.440 --> 12:14.900
&lt;KISSING&gt;

12:23.070 --> 12:25.910
SO ACCORDING TO DES,
HE WAS SKATEBOARDING.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.200
SOMEWHERE.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.750
YEAH, AND THEN HE TURNS UP
AT THE MALE STRIP CLUB.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.960
ALONG THE WAY
HE PICKS UP A FRIEND,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.290
A VAN, A S.C.U.B.A. MASK,
A SNORKEL, AND A GUN.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.000
SO, BIT OF A GAP THERE.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.550
HIM AND HIS FRIEND, RIGHT?
THEY GO TO THE MALE STRIP
CLUB FOR A GOOD TIME,

12:39.590 --> 12:40.670
THEY GET THROWN OUT,

12:40.710 --> 12:43.090
THEN THEY GO ACROSS THE STREET
TO THE CORNER STORE

12:43.130 --> 12:47.260
WHERE UM, THE MENACING STORE
CLERK KICKS DES' ASS.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.730
AND THEN UNKNOWN FRIEND
PANICS, TAKES OFF IN THE VAN.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.350
LEAVING DES TO ESCAPE
IN MY CAR.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.730
NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.400
UNCLE JAKE, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.520
[JAKE] YEAH.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.440
I DID A DRUG TEST ON DES.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.940
YOU DID A WHAT?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.820
MY FRIEND WORKS AT THE LAB,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.530
THE POINT IS, SHE FOUND
KETAMINE IN HIS BLOOD.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.030
KETAMINE? WHAT'S KETAMINE?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.040
SPECIAL K. IT'S A STREET DRUG.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.790
A LOT OF KIDS ARE DOING IT
THESE DAYS.

13:12.910 --> 13:14.870
WHAT, YOU THINK THAT
DES IS ON DRUGS?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.170
I GOTTA SAY,

13:16.210 --> 13:18.880
IT DOESN'T ADD UP,
BUT WHO KNOWS?

13:19.590 --> 13:20.840
CRAP.

13:20.880 --> 13:21.920
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

13:21.960 --> 13:24.010
MAYBE...

13:24.050 --> 13:26.090
MAYBE WE HAVE
NO IDEA WHO DES IS.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.930
[ROSE] HEY GUYS.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.390
I DON'T QUITE KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT, UM...

13:31.430 --> 13:33.020
DES' ADDRESS IS BOGUS.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.940
-BOGUS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-I JUST WENT THERE.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.190
IT'S DESERTED AND BOARDED UP
LIKE NO ONE'S LIVED THERE
IN YEARS.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.860
NOT ONLY THAT,
HIS HEALTH CARD NUMBER,
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE

13:39.900 --> 13:41.400
AND HIS SOCIAL INSURANCE
NUMBER ARE ALL FAKE.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.530
WHAT?

13:42.570 --> 13:43.860
I CAN'T FIND
DES COURTNEY ANYWHERE.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.820
IS "DES COURTNEY"
HIS REAL NAME?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.370
DES COURTNEY DOESN'T EXIST.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.840
-WHAT IS THIS?
-[JAKE] YOUR BLOOD WORK.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.050
TESTED POSITIVE FOR KETAMINE.

14:06.090 --> 14:07.130
YOU ON DRUGS, DES?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.050
NO, NO. JAKE,
I SWEAR TO GOD, I HADN'T,

14:09.090 --> 14:10.600
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.680
WHERE DO YOU LIVE? HMM?

14:14.730 --> 14:15.940
WHERE'S YOUR HOUSE?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.100
WHERE'S YOUR FAMILY?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.650
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

14:21.690 --> 14:23.900
WE KNOW THAT YOUR REAL NAME
IS NOT DES COURTNEY.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.910
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO US.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.410
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FAMILY.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.250
AND NOW, IT DOESN'T...

14:38.290 --> 14:40.210
IT DOESN'T EVEN...
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY,

14:40.250 --> 14:42.250
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME ANYWAY.

14:43.630 --> 14:47.090
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW ANY OF THIS HAPPENED.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.390
ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST START
AT THE BEGINNING, ALL RIGHT?

14:51.430 --> 14:52.640
AND, UH...

14:54.100 --> 14:56.180
FOCUS ON WHAT WE KNOW.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.480
WE KNOW THAT
YOU WENT TO A STRIP CLUB.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.480
A... MALE...

15:01.520 --> 15:02.980
STRIP CLUB, FOR THE RECORD.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.780
WE KNOW THAT
YOU HAD A FRIEND WITH YOU,

15:04.820 --> 15:06.030
AND THAT FRIEND HAD A VAN.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.490
A FRIEND W... A FRIEND WHO?

15:07.530 --> 15:09.610
AN ARSE ONE APPARENTLY,
BECAUSE HE BAILED ON YOU
AS SOON

15:09.660 --> 15:11.530
AS YOU STARTED TO RIP OFF
THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

15:11.570 --> 15:12.990
ANY IDEAS WHO IT COULD BE?

15:13.030 --> 15:13.950
NO!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.000
JAKE,

15:17.200 --> 15:20.040
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.630
I SWEAR TO GOD I AM!

15:23.040 --> 15:25.380
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME, OKAY?

15:25.420 --> 15:26.710
YOU HAVE TO!

15:28.260 --> 15:29.380
WAIT, I THINK...
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,

15:29.430 --> 15:31.840
I THINK I REMEMBER A...

15:31.890 --> 15:34.010

THERE WAS A GUY! I WAS...

15:34.050 --> 15:35.970

YEAH, THANKS.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.040
THIS IS EVERYTHING
DES HAD ON HIM

15:59.080 --> 16:00.790
AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.130
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR HIS I.D.,
HIS CELL PHONE.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.090
SWITCHBLADE...

16:07.130 --> 16:09.630
&lt;LAUGHING&gt; I USED
TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.590

16:18.060 --> 16:19.470

16:19.520 --> 16:21.230
THERE'S A HOLE. I THINK I FEEL
THE PHONE IN THE LINING.

16:21.770 --> 16:22.980
DISTRACT HIM.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.690
&lt;WHISPERING&gt; WHAT?

16:24.730 --> 16:25.980
&lt;WHISPERING&gt; DISTRACT HIM.

YOU KNOW, HE'S...
HE'S A GOOD KID.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.700
-IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOME KIND
OF COLOSSAL MISTAKE.
-[JAKE] WALTER!

16:36.740 --> 16:37.830
-YEAH?

16:37.870 --> 16:38.990

REALLY WELL FILED, THOUGH.
THANKS A LOT.

16:42.290 --> 16:43.170

16:43.210 --> 16:44.630
YOU'RE GONNA GET ME DISBARRED,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.250
I'M AN OFFICER OF THE COURT!

16:47.710 --> 16:49.460

KIND OF PASSWORD.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.590
HERE, GIVE IT TO ME.

16:50.630 --> 16:53.260
&lt;SIGHING&gt; SPECIAL K,
ALSO KNOWN AS HORSE.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.510
IT'S A NEW CLUB DRUG,
BIGGER THAN E.

16:55.550 --> 16:58.260
IT'S INJECTED, SNORTED,
SWALLOWED, SMOKED.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.600
WHAT'RE THE SYMPTOMS?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.430
OH GOSH, WHOLE GRAB BAG.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.270
DISASSOCIATION, UH,
IMPAIRED MOTOR FUNCTION...

17:04.310 --> 17:05.980
-&lt;CELL PHONE BEEPING&gt;
-MEMORY LOSS?

17:06.020 --> 17:08.020
YES, BUT NOT ONLY THAT.
IT'S NOT ONLY A STREET DRUG,

17:08.070 --> 17:11.110
IT'S ACTUALLY
A LEGITIMATE TRANQUILIZER
USED MOSTLY ON ANIMALS.

17:11.150 --> 17:12.860
-REALLY?
-YEAH. THAT'S HOW
THEY'RE GETTING IT.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.240
THEY'RE ROBBING
VETERINARY CLINICS.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.160
SO DES' BUDDIES ARE
ROBBING VETS AT GUN POINT?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.740
WELL, LET'S CHECK IN ALL
THE VETS IN TOWN,

17:17.780 --> 17:20.080
SEE IF THEY WERE HELD UP

17:20.120 --> 17:22.120
YEAH. TINNY,
ARE YOU OKAY, HONEY?

17:22.160 --> 17:23.710
I FEEL LIKE
I'M MISSING SOMETHING.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.000
LIKE WE ALL ARE.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.630
[JAKE] ANY IDEAS
ABOUT THIS PHONE?

17:27.670 --> 17:29.550
I JUST NEED A PASSWORD.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.880
TRY TINNY.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.220

17:43.640 --> 17:45.020

17:46.770 --> 17:48.150
I'M SENSING A THEME?

17:52.650 --> 17:53.860
THERE HE IS.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.360
[TINNY] HE'S BOARDING.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.570
IS THERE A TIME STAMP?

17:56.610 --> 17:57.950
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.990

NORMAL LOOKING...

18:07.080 --> 18:08.250
WHAT IS THAT BEHIND HIM?

18:08.290 --> 18:09.380
IT'S THE GETAWAY VAN.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.170
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.470
ROSE, EMAIL ME THAT PHOTO,
PRINT IT OFF OR SOMETHING.

18:16.010 --> 18:18.050
[LESLIE] THE BAIL HEARING IS
SET FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

18:18.090 --> 18:19.300
SO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA LET HIM GO?

18:19.340 --> 18:20.550
DEPENDS ON THE CROWN.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.310
IF SHE WANTS TO KEEP HIM
IN CUSTODY, SHE CAN.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.230
ARE YOU OKAY, JAKE?
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YA.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.730
YEAH, I'M FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,

18:26.770 --> 18:29.100
JUST WORRY ABOUT DES,

18:29.150 --> 18:32.020
LOOK, I KNOW...
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD,

18:32.070 --> 18:34.610
AND IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS, BUT...

18:34.650 --> 18:37.110
ALLISON, SHE'S REALLY PUSHING
AHEAD WITH THIS INDICTMENT.

18:37.910 --> 18:38.990
YEAH.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.450
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-SORRY.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.240
[LESLIE] IT'S OKAY, TAKE IT.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.700
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED, OKAY?
CALL ME?

18:47.410 --> 18:49.580
ALLISON. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO TO ME HERE?

18:51.170 --> 18:53.000
I COULD PACIFY A LAW
ONTO A COLLEAGUE.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.130
WOULD THAT BE BETTER?

18:54.170 --> 18:55.260
[JAKE] OH, THAT DEPENDS.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.300
WOULD YOUR COLLEAGUE BE
MORE SYMPATHETIC, MAYBE?

18:57.340 --> 18:59.050
NO, HE WOULDN'T. TRUST ME.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.680
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND WAS CAUGHT,

19:00.720 --> 19:03.890
ON TAPE, ROBBING A STORE,
WITH A GUN IN HIS HAND.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.020
-YOU'VE GOT TO LET...
-[JAKE] LET YOU?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.560
LET YOU DO WHAT, EXACTLY?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.390
ALLISON,

19:08.440 --> 19:09.940
IS THERE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH YOU?

19:09.980 --> 19:11.270
OR... ALLISON?

19:11.310 --> 19:12.650
'KAY, I GOTTA GO, JAKE.

19:12.690 --> 19:14.940
UM, I'LL KEEP YOU UP TO
SPEED ON THE FILE,

19:14.980 --> 19:16.400
BUT I GOTTA DO
WHAT I GOTTA DO HERE, OKAY?

19:16.440 --> 19:17.440
I'M SORRY.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.030
&lt;BEEPING&gt;

19:30.370 --> 19:31.460
THIS IS THE ADDRESS?

19:31.500 --> 19:32.920
YEP. WEIRD, HUH?

19:43.470 --> 19:44.680
HUH! CHECK IT OUT!

19:44.720 --> 19:45.810
[ROSE] HERE. CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.640
[TINNY] HELP ME MOVE THIS
AND WE'LL GO IN.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.100
OH, MY GOD!

19:50.020 --> 19:52.350
[TINNY] HELLO? ANYBODY HOME?

19:56.230 --> 19:58.440
OH, MY GOD,
DES HAS BEEN LIVING HERE?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.070
[ROSE] OH, I HOPE NOT.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.070
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

20:18.340 --> 20:20.720
OH, TINNY, LOOK.
IT SAYS DES COURTNEY.

20:21.510 --> 20:23.340
SO, YEAH. HE IS LIVING HERE.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.810
[TINNY] ROSE, C'MERE.

20:28.850 --> 20:29.980
WHAT'D YA GOT?

20:30.890 --> 20:32.440
THEY'RE FROM THE '90S.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.270
-[ROSE] JODY REDMOND.
-DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

20:34.310 --> 20:36.900
YEAH, YEAH. HE WAS
A FAMOUS BANK ROBBER.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.690
HE PULLED OFF
A BUNCH OF HEISTS.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.110
THINK HE GOT LIKE, 15 YEARS?

20:41.150 --> 20:43.570
WELL, WHAT IS DES
DOING WITH ALL OF THIS?

20:44.950 --> 20:47.120
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S OBSESSED
WITH THIS CASE.

20:48.660 --> 20:51.200
[JAKE] HOW MANY VET CLINICS
ARE THERE IN ST. JOHN'S,
ANYWAY?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.910
[MAL] AT LEAST A DOZEN,
AND I'VE CHECKED 'EM ALL OUT.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.290
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.

20:54.330 --> 20:55.710
[JAKE] DAD, CHECK IT OUT.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.340
HE LOOK LIKE OUR GUY TO YOU?

21:00.380 --> 21:02.420
[MAL] LOOKS LIKE
DES' FRIEND, YEAH.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.430
HE'S A JANITOR
AT A VET CLINIC?

21:04.470 --> 21:05.640
THAT'S ONE WAY
THAT'D GUARANTEE

21:05.680 --> 21:07.180
A STEADY SUPPLY OF KETAMINE.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.310
HEY, BUDDY! NICE TOQUE.

21:15.810 --> 21:18.440
JUST HANG ON!
I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU!

21:18.480 --> 21:19.940
&lt;CAR HORN BEEPING&gt;

21:32.580 --> 21:33.710
[DES] ZACH DOUGLAS.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.210
I KNOW THAT GUY.
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH HIM.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.960
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU SAW HIM?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.590
AGES AGO. LAST YEAR MAYBE?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.840
I ALWAYS USED TO HELP HIM WITH
HIS HOMEWORK AND STUFF.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.260
HOW NICE OF YOU.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.380
NOW, THIS ONE WAS
TAKEN YESTERDAY

21:45.430 --> 21:47.720
ON YOUR CELL PHONE WHILE
YOU WERE SKATEBOARDING.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.430
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS HIM.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.640
NO, NO, NO, I JUST REMEMBERED!

21:52.680 --> 21:54.520
I-I REMEMBER HIM NOW.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.480
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, DES.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.360
I MEAN I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE INTO THIS, YOU KNOW?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.690
YOU'RE DOING DRUGS?
YOU'RE-YOU'RE-

22:00.730 --> 22:02.280
YOU'RE RIPPING OFF
CONVENIENCE STORES?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.360
NO, I'M NOT! NO, I'M NOT!

22:03.400 --> 22:06.030
LOOK, ZACH, HE...

22:06.070 --> 22:07.530
HE WAS ALWAYS TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF ME,

22:07.570 --> 22:09.200
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN AGES,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.080
BUT YESTERDAY,
I GUESS, HE...

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
LOOK, JAKE, THIS ISN'T ME.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.700
THIS IS NOT ME. YOU KNOW ME.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.210
NO, I DON'T. NOT REALLY.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.750
DES, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW YOU AT ALL.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.430
WHAT?

22:29.050 --> 22:31.470
WHEN TINNY TOOK YOUR BLOOD,

22:31.510 --> 22:32.890
WHERE'D SHE GET YOU
WITH THE NEEDLE?

22:32.930 --> 22:34.140
WHAT?

22:34.180 --> 22:36.480
WHERE'S THE NEEDLE PRICK
FROM WHEN TINNY STABBED YOU?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.980
OH, OH, IT'S RIGHT THERE.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.400
OW! I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T DO DRUGS EITHER.

22:41.770 --> 22:44.610
I'M ACTUALLY STARTING
TO BELIEVE YOU.

22:44.650 --> 22:47.490
OW! YOU DO?
OW! OW! WHAT IS IT?

22:48.530 --> 22:49.410
IT'S A NEEDLE MARK.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.030
I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE
WHO SHOOT UP

22:51.070 --> 22:52.580
IN THE BACK OF THEIR NECK.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.120
EVEN PEOPLE AS STUPID AS YOU.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.210
S-SOMEONE STABBED ME?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.620
SOMEONE DRUGGED ME.
SOMEONE DRUG...

22:58.670 --> 23:00.290
OH, THANK GOD. FIRST...

23:00.330 --> 23:01.920
WAIT, SOMEONE STABBED ME?
DOES IT LOOK BAD?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.460
[JAKE] LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.750
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD BE?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.050
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
YOU RECOGNIZE?

23:06.090 --> 23:07.130
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

23:07.170 --> 23:09.510
&lt;MUMBLING&gt; UH, I DUNNO. UM...

23:09.550 --> 23:10.760
CONCENTRATE!

23:12.100 --> 23:13.350
THE WAR MEMORIAL.

23:13.390 --> 23:15.640
THE WAR MEMORIAL DOWNTOWN,
I REMEMBER!

23:15.680 --> 23:16.890
IT'S THE WAR MEMORIAL!

23:20.980 --> 23:22.480
[SKATER] SWEET.
NICE OLLIE, MAN.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.990
ZACH! DOUGLAS!
REMEMBER US?

23:29.030 --> 23:30.660
ARE YOU COPS OR WHAT?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.240
WHY? YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU GOTTA HIDE?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.870
NO. OKAY, BACK OFF, MAN!

23:33.910 --> 23:36.040
I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A MUTUAL FRIEND.
DES COURTNEY.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.370
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.160
[JAKE] LIAR!

23:39.210 --> 23:40.960
MAN, CHILL! ALL RIGHT?
YOU GOT NO RIGHT!

23:41.000 --> 23:44.250
RIGHTS? TODAY IS NOT THE DAY
TO BE TALKING TO ME ABOUT
RIGHTS, PAL!

23:44.290 --> 23:45.710
-[MAL] JAKE!
-[ZACH] OW!

23:45.750 --> 23:47.170
WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'?

23:47.210 --> 23:48.380
&lt;CROWD GASPING&gt;

23:48.420 --> 23:50.300
[JAKE] YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS'LL GO A LOT EASIER

23:50.340 --> 23:51.720
IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT WITH US!

23:51.760 --> 23:54.470
OW! I AM, MAN! I AM!

23:54.510 --> 23:55.560
[MAL] JAKE!

23:55.600 --> 23:57.270
[JAKE] OH, YEAH? YOU ARE?
YOU ARE, HUH?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.060
YOU THINK
I'M FOOLIN' AROUND, HUH?

23:59.100 --> 24:00.440
YOU THINK I'M FOOLIN' AROUND?

24:01.350 --> 24:02.480
&lt;CROWD YELLING&gt;

24:04.230 --> 24:05.860
HERE, KID, JUST
WAIT A MINUTE. C'MERE!

24:05.900 --> 24:08.400
DAD! DAD!
JUST LET HIM GO.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.530
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

24:09.570 --> 24:13.110
WHAT? OH! I PLANTED
A G.P.S. IN HIS KNAPSACK.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.030
OH, GOOD. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE LOSING IT THERE.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.950
-NO, NO. C'MON,
LET'S FOLLOW 'EM.
-[MAL] OKAY.

24:21.580 --> 24:22.750
[JAKE] HEADS UP.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.010
[MAL] INTERESTING.

24:30.050 --> 24:31.630
[JAKE] I RECOGNIZE
THAT FACE FROM SOMEWHERE.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.430
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.600
LOOK, I KNEW
I RECOGNIZED THIS GUY.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.430
HE WAS IN THE CONVENIENCE
STORE WITH DES.

24:38.470 --> 24:39.640
[ROSE] YEP,
IT'S ANTON STRAZZA.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.020
HE'S A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN,

24:41.060 --> 24:43.480
RUNS AND IMPORT-EXPORT FIRM
HERE IN TOWN.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.520
CRIMINAL RECORD?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.900
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT, AND
ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION

24:46.940 --> 24:48.650
BETWEEN HIM AND
THE SKATEBOARD KID, ZACH.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.900
SO, WHAT? HE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE IN THE CORNER STORE

24:50.940 --> 24:52.070
WHEN DES IS ROBBING IT?

24:52.110 --> 24:54.030
AND ZACH JUST HAPPENS
TO RUN TO HIM

24:54.070 --> 24:55.530
AS SOON AS WE PUT ON THE HEAT?

24:55.570 --> 24:58.490
WHY? YOU THINK THIS GUY'S
BEHIND THE WHOLE THING?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.870
HE DRUGS DES, AND
THEN HE'S AT THE STORE

25:00.910 --> 25:02.790
TO WATCH THE WHOLE FIASCO
GO DOWN?

25:02.830 --> 25:04.290
AND THEN HE JUMPS
INTO THE GETAWAY VAN?

25:04.330 --> 25:05.830
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA GET

25:05.880 --> 25:07.750
FROM A CONVENIENCE STORE TILL?

25:07.790 --> 25:09.090
[JAKE] COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS?

25:09.130 --> 25:10.710
THAT'S NOTHING
TO A GUY LIKE HIM.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.670
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS AGAIN?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.680
ANTON STRAZZA?

25:13.720 --> 25:16.090
STRAZZA, STRAZZA, STRAZZA.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.930
STRAZZA, STRAZZA, STRAZZA...

25:20.680 --> 25:21.850
LOOK AT THIS.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.690
VEILED MADONNA.

25:24.730 --> 25:28.980
THE VEILED MADONNA IS
GOING ON TOUR TOMORROW.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.900
AND THE NAME
OF THE SCULPTOR IS...

25:30.940 --> 25:32.110
STRAZZA?

25:32.150 --> 25:36.240
"19TH CENTURY ITALIAN
SCULPTOR, GIOVANNI STRAZZA."

25:36.280 --> 25:38.660
LETTER TO THE EDITOR FROM
LAST YEAR FROM ANTON STRAZZA:

25:38.700 --> 25:40.660
"THE VEILED MADONNA
WAS STOLEN FROM MY FAMILY.

25:40.700 --> 25:41.790
"IT IS PREPOSTEROUS THAT
OUR PROPERTY

25:41.830 --> 25:42.950
"HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.710
"IT IS MY BIRTH RIGHT.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.080
"THIS PROVINCE WILL PAY."

25:46.120 --> 25:47.710
THIS GUY'S A TOTAL WINGNUT!

25:47.750 --> 25:49.710
THEY KEEP THE MADONNA
AT THE BASILICA!

25:49.750 --> 25:53.420
UNCLE JAKE, ARMED ROBBERY'S
A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

25:53.470 --> 25:54.670
SO WHEN DES HELD UP
THE CORNER STORE,

25:54.720 --> 25:57.390
EVERY POLICE CAR
IN THE VICINITY
WOULD'VE RESPONDED.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.510
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:58.550 --> 26:00.850
ALL RIGHT. THE CONVENIENCE
STORE IS HERE,

26:00.890 --> 26:02.680
THE POLICE STATION'S
OUT HERE...

26:02.720 --> 26:04.680
IF DES RIPS OFF
THE CONVENIENCE STORE,

26:04.730 --> 26:06.190
EVERY COP IS GONNA SHOW UP.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.900
THEN THEY GET IN
A HIGH-SPEED CHASE

26:07.940 --> 26:10.270
WHICH TAKES THEM WAY THE FRIG
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE...

26:10.320 --> 26:11.400
EVEN FURTHER AWAY.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.820
RIGHT. DESMOND WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO SUCCEED.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.110
HE WAS JUST SUPPOSED
TO MAKE A SCENE!

26:15.820 --> 26:18.070
THE WHOLE THING
WAS A DIVERSION

26:18.110 --> 26:20.740
WHILE ANTON STRAZZA IS
STEALING THE VEILED MADONNA

26:20.780 --> 26:22.700
FROM THE BASILICA, HERE.

26:23.830 --> 26:25.580
&lt;CHURCH BELLS RINGING&gt;

26:29.710 --> 26:31.500
[LESLIE] IT HAPPENED
JUST BEFORE DAWN.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.550
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE ALL
CHASING DES IN MY CAR.

26:33.590 --> 26:36.340
THE ALARM WENT OFF
AND YES, WE RESPONDED,

26:36.840 --> 26:38.800
BUT WHEN WE GOT HERE...

26:38.840 --> 26:40.220
THE VEILED MADONNA WAS GONE.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.350
STRAZZA GAINED HIMSELF
ENOUGH TIME TO GET AWAY.

26:42.390 --> 26:45.310
AND ALL IT COST WAS
TEN YEARS OF DES' LIFE.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.650
OKAY, THE WHOLE THING
WAS A SETUP.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.360
ALL RIGHT?
FIRST, THEY DRUGGED DES,

26:53.400 --> 26:54.860
AND THEN THEY SOMEHOW
CONVINCE HIM

26:54.900 --> 26:56.150
TO RIP OFF
THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

26:56.190 --> 26:57.740
I'M TELLING YOU HE'S INNOCENT.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.820
ALL SO THEY COULD STEAL
THE MADONNA?

26:59.860 --> 27:02.780
DES IS THE EASIEST MARK
I'VE EVER MET, ALL RIGHT?

27:02.830 --> 27:05.250
YOU ASK HIM NICELY
AND HE'LL PRETTY MUCH
DO ANYTHING FOR YA.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.080
IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING, LESLIE.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.790
YOU THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE
THAT EVERY CRUISER IN TOWN

27:09.830 --> 27:11.840
JUST HAPPENS TO BE CHASING DES

27:11.880 --> 27:13.920
WHILE SOME MORON IS RIPPING
OFF THE VEILED MADONNA?

27:13.960 --> 27:17.220
LOOK, EVEN IF I DID BELIEVE
YOU, IT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.140
OKAY? THE CROWN IS HARDLY
GONNA DROP THE CHARGES ON DES

27:20.180 --> 27:22.300
BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE
STOLE A STATUE.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.890
&lt;PEN CLICKING&gt;

27:27.930 --> 27:30.400
[JAKE] "ANTON STRAZZA."

27:30.440 --> 27:33.310
PICK HIM UP AND TALK TO HIM.
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.070
WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT BEFORE?

27:35.110 --> 27:37.030
WHAT TIME IS IT?

27:37.070 --> 27:38.900
LOOK, I'M LATE FOR
THE BAIL HEARING.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.160
JUST TALK TO STRAZZA.

27:45.870 --> 27:46.870
REDMOND...

27:47.790 --> 27:48.910
JODY REDMOND.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.800
SO? WHAT HAPPENED?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.130
WE LOST. CROWN OPPOSED BAIL.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.840
WHEN YOU SAY THE CROWN,
DO YOU MEAN...

28:02.890 --> 28:04.510
OH, YEAH! YEAH,
IT WAS ALLISON.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.100
WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.770
I GOTTA TELL YA, BOYS,
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.810
NICE GIRL YOU GOT THERE.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.770
SHE'S DOING HER JOB, OKAY?
JUST LEAVE IT.

28:13.810 --> 28:16.320
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.820
WE GOT A LEAD, COUPLE
LEADS MAYBE. THAT'S IT.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.030
GOOD.

28:20.070 --> 28:22.910
CAUSE I'M GONNA NEED
SOMETHING TO BASE A CASE ON.

28:22.950 --> 28:24.070
I GOTTA RUN.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.830
NOW WHAT?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.450
GET A BETTER LAWYER?

28:27.490 --> 28:29.040
I'LL CHECK OUT THE ZACH KID.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.500
GIMME A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

28:30.540 --> 28:31.710

28:36.670 --> 28:39.800
WELL I GUESS, UH,
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.300
JAKE. HI.

28:41.340 --> 28:42.760
HOW ARE YOU?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.970
HOW'S YOUR, UH, FRIEND?
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

28:45.010 --> 28:47.060
SIMON? HE'S MY HUSBAND.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.850
REALLY?

28:48.890 --> 28:50.230
JAKE, WE'RE FINISHING UP
OUR DIVORCE,

28:50.270 --> 28:52.230
AND IT'S A TRAIN WRECK,

28:52.270 --> 28:54.270
AND I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

28:54.310 --> 28:57.690
IF YOU WOULD JUST
STAY OUT OF IT, OKAY?

28:57.730 --> 28:59.320
LET ME SORT OUT MY LIFE.

29:00.990 --> 29:01.860
FINE.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.240
THANKS.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.740
ON ONE CONDITION.

29:05.780 --> 29:08.280
YOU KEEP DES OUT OF
HER MAJESTY'S PEN.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.700
I DUNNO WHAT
YOUR BEEF IS WITH HIM,

29:10.750 --> 29:12.910
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
HE IS A GOOD GUY.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.790
ALL RIGHT? HE'S ACTUALLY
A LITTLE BIT OF A SWEETHEART,

29:14.830 --> 29:16.790
SO JUST GIVE ME A BREAK HERE.

29:17.670 --> 29:18.920
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.430
[DES] SO A DIVERSION.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

29:28.470 --> 29:30.890
[TINNY] IT WAS ALL A SETUP,
WHICH MEANS IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.

29:30.930 --> 29:31.930
WE JUST GOTTA PROVE IT.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.890
SO, ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN REMEMBER...

29:33.940 --> 29:34.890
I KNOW, I'M TRYING.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.350
BUT Y... BUT YOU HAVE
THE DRUG TEST, RIGHT?

29:36.400 --> 29:38.270
&lt;SIGHING&gt;
IT'S NOT ENOUGH, DES.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.990
IS JAKE PISSED AT ME?

29:42.030 --> 29:43.400
NO! HE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.490
I FEEL LIKE I LET HIM DOWN.

29:46.530 --> 29:47.780
DON'T BE STUPID.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.700
I HATE IT IN HERE.
IT TOTALLY BITES.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.410
DES, ME AND ROSE...

29:55.040 --> 29:56.460
WE WENT TO YOUR PLACE.

29:58.790 --> 29:59.880
WHAT?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.920
YOU WENT TO MY PLACE?
M-MY HOUSE? WHY?

30:02.960 --> 30:04.260
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
LYING TO US?

30:04.300 --> 30:06.180
YOUR REAL NAME?
IT'S MADE UP!

30:06.220 --> 30:07.640
EVERYTHING'S MADE UP!

30:07.680 --> 30:10.180
AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT BANK
ROBBER GUY? THAT CASE?

30:10.220 --> 30:11.350
WHY'RE YOU
SO OBSESSED WITH IT?

30:11.390 --> 30:13.810
TINNY! THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS!

30:13.850 --> 30:14.890
WHY DID YOU GO THERE?

30:14.930 --> 30:16.980
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE THAT!
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE THERE!

30:17.020 --> 30:18.150
HEY, CALM DOWN!

30:18.190 --> 30:19.980
OH, MY GOD, OH, GOD,
EVERYTHING'S FALLIN' APART!

30:20.020 --> 30:23.030
[TINNY] DES! HEY! HEY.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.530
YOU'RE OKAY.

30:33.490 --> 30:34.790
CAN I TELL PEOPLE
YOU DID THAT?

30:35.660 --> 30:36.920
NO.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.000
OKAY. WHO'D I TELL ANYWAY?

30:39.040 --> 30:39.880
JUST A GUARD, MAYBE?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
-DES!
-OKAY, I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.840
[STRAZZA] THE VEILED
MADONNA'S GONE?

30:45.880 --> 30:47.090
AND YOU THINK THAT I?

30:48.260 --> 30:50.010
DON'T BE ABSURD!

30:50.050 --> 30:53.010
I'VE NEVER STOLEN
ANYTHING IN MY LIFE!

30:53.060 --> 30:56.020
THAT'S A FACT! A-A-A-AND-AND
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS
PERSON...

30:56.060 --> 30:57.770
-W-W-WHAT'S HIS NAME?
-DES.

30:57.810 --> 30:59.900
DES, DES.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.980
OH, REALLY? MR. STRAZZA...

31:02.020 --> 31:04.480
OH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
STRAT-ZA.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.490
OKAY, MR. "STRAT-ZA."

31:06.530 --> 31:08.320
CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR YOUR
WHEREABOUTS LAST NIGHT?

31:08.360 --> 31:09.700
[STRAZZA] HA! YES.

31:09.740 --> 31:13.200
ACTUALLY, I WAS HAVING
A GLASS OF PORT

31:13.240 --> 31:15.040
IN MY LOCAL WATERING HOLE.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.500
I CAN GIVE YOU THE NAMES OF
AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE
WHO SAW ME THERE.

31:17.540 --> 31:20.040
OH, IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT?
NEXT ROUND'S ON YOU?

31:20.080 --> 31:22.790
YOU'RE QUITE TAKEN WITH
THE MADONNA, ARE YOU NOT?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.250
MEANING WHAT, EXACTLY?

31:24.300 --> 31:26.550
YOU'RE OBSESSED
WITH THIS STATUE.

31:26.590 --> 31:29.010
YOU CLAIM TO BE DESCENDED
FROM THE ARTIST.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.260
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
IN THE MEDIA,

31:31.300 --> 31:32.930
YOU'VE SAID IT RIGHTLY
BELONGS TO YOU.

31:32.970 --> 31:36.020
YES! YES, YES, I-I BELIEVE

31:36.060 --> 31:38.060
WE HAVE A LEGITIMATE CLAIM
TO THE STATUE,

31:38.100 --> 31:40.140
AND A PASSION FOR IT.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.940
BUT WOULD I STEAL IT?

31:41.980 --> 31:43.360
PLEASE.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.110
LOOK, DO I NEED
TO SPEAK TO A LAWYER?

31:46.150 --> 31:47.690
I DON'T KNOW. DO YA?

31:47.740 --> 31:48.900
I MEAN, AM I BEING DETAINED?

31:50.450 --> 31:53.780
HMM, OKAY, THEN I
GUESS I'M FREE TO GO?

31:53.830 --> 31:56.490
GOODBYE, SERGEANT.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.370
PERHAPS YOU COULD SHOW ME OUT?

31:58.410 --> 32:01.670
THAT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME,
MR. STRAZZA.

32:01.710 --> 32:02.710
STRAT-ZA.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.000
UH, WELL EXCUSE ME.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.460
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.220
HE'S LYING.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.220
MAYBE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.930
IF HE'S A THIEF
HE'S A GOOD ONE.

32:16.430 --> 32:17.850
HE LEFT NO TRACKS, JAKE.

32:17.890 --> 32:18.980
WE SHOULD SEARCH HIS HOUSE.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.020
TELL ME HOW WE'RE GONNA
GET A WARRANT FOR THAT ONE?

32:21.060 --> 32:23.100
LOOK, DES IS RUNNING OUT
OF TIME, ALL RIGHT?

32:23.150 --> 32:24.650
HE GETS DEEPER EVERY MINUTE.

32:25.150 --> 32:28.030
THE CROWN? ALLISON?

32:28.070 --> 32:29.280
SHE'S UPPIN' THE CHARGES.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.860
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.780
HE SMACKED HIMSELF
IN THE FA...

32:32.820 --> 32:33.910
WHO DID HE ASSAULT?

32:33.950 --> 32:35.740
HE HELD UP A STORE
AT GUNPOINT, JAKE!

32:35.780 --> 32:37.450
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YA!

32:37.490 --> 32:40.080
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S NOT
WASTING ANY TIME.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.250
SORRY.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.830
&lt;DOOR UNLOCKING&gt;

33:00.810 --> 33:02.810
HI. UH, JODY REDMOND?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.190
HI, I'M ROSE DOYLE.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.230
IT'S A BIG DAY FOR ME!

33:08.270 --> 33:09.780
I DON'T GET A LOT OF VISITORS.

33:11.570 --> 33:12.780
OH, THESE ARE FOR YOU.

33:12.820 --> 33:14.700
SOME MAGAZINES.
I WASN'T SURE WHAT YOU'D LIKE.

33:14.740 --> 33:15.990
OH, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
THANK YOU.

33:17.910 --> 33:20.540
MY EX DID 15 YEARS, SO I...

33:22.460 --> 33:23.710
YOU GOT MY EMAIL?

33:23.750 --> 33:25.830
YOU WANT TO SEE THE PICTURES.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.500
I KNOW IT'S AN ODD REQUEST
AND I'D RATHER NOT TELL YOU

33:28.540 --> 33:30.210
RIGHT NOW, IF THAT'S OKAY?

33:30.250 --> 33:33.340
[JODY] WELL, LIKE I SAID,
I'M... HAPPY TO SHOW.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.800
SO, I GET ONE EVERY YEAR. HA!

33:37.850 --> 33:39.510
ONLY TIME I HEAR FROM HIM.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.640
JUST ONCE A YEAR.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.190
LAST TIME I SAW HIM, HE...

33:45.940 --> 33:47.360
HE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.690
I MEAN, THAT'S, UH...

33:55.820 --> 33:57.070
THAT'S MY SON.

34:08.290 --> 34:09.920
MUST BE RIVETING STUFF.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.170
THIS CASE I GOT.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.800
DES COURTNEY.

34:14.170 --> 34:15.590
OH, THAT. THE DOYLE KID.

34:17.090 --> 34:19.600
TECHNICALLY HE'S NOT A DOYLE
BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL BE.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.760
HE'S A GOOD KID, Y'KNOW?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.220
HE'S GOT CHARACTER.

34:23.270 --> 34:27.190
YEAH. YEAH, HE ROBBED
A CORNER STORE AT GUNPOINT,
BUT... &lt;LAUGHING&gt;

34:27.230 --> 34:28.190
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT HE...

34:28.230 --> 34:30.310
"BUT?" REALLY?

34:31.110 --> 34:32.150
THERE'S A "BUT?"

34:32.190 --> 34:35.030
LESLIE, THE LAW
IS THE LAW, Y'KNOW?

34:35.070 --> 34:37.200
THE CITY'S TURNING
INTO GOTHAM OVERNIGHT.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.160
CAN'T GO AROUND MAKING
EXCEPTIONS FOR EVERYBODY.

34:42.370 --> 34:44.160
EVEN, UH, JAKE DOYLE.

34:49.170 --> 34:53.000
ALL RIGHT, SO WE WAIT
UNTIL IT GETS A LITTLE DARKER.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.090
[MAL] UNTIL HE'S ASLEEP.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.340
RIGHT, AND THEN WE, UH...

34:59.550 --> 35:02.760
ENTER THE HOUSE ABOUT HERE.

35:02.810 --> 35:05.680
APPARENTLY HE LIKES
TO NAP IN HERE.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.190
THE ALARM?

35:07.230 --> 35:10.020
THE ALARM PANEL IS
SITUATED RIGHT THERE.

35:11.230 --> 35:12.400
RIGHT THERE?

35:17.070 --> 35:18.110
WHAT?

35:19.490 --> 35:20.740
I DUNNO.

35:23.910 --> 35:26.200
ARE WE REALLY GONNA BREAK
INTO THIS GUY'S HOUSE?

35:26.250 --> 35:27.660
DO WE HAVE ANY CHOICE
IN THE MATTER?

35:27.710 --> 35:28.920
WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR A KID.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.370
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HIS REAL NAME.

35:30.420 --> 35:33.340
IN FACT, WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GUY.

35:33.380 --> 35:36.210
I THINK WE KNOW EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DES.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.920
DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.680
HE'S A GOOD KID,
I'M SURE OF IT.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.970
AND SO ARE YOU.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.310
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT.

35:48.350 --> 35:49.390
LET'S DO IT.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.440
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

36:44.240 --> 36:45.530
&lt;WHISPERING&gt;
IT'S A NICE PLACE.

36:45.570 --> 36:46.870
&lt;WHISPERING&gt;
I'VE SEEN NICER.

36:49.370 --> 36:50.620
&lt;MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

36:52.920 --> 36:54.250
&lt;SNORING&gt;

36:56.130 --> 36:57.340
[JAKE] YOU READY?

36:57.380 --> 36:58.340

37:05.340 --> 37:07.010
&lt;ALARM BLARING&gt;

37:09.390 --> 37:10.270
[STRAZZA] AH!

37:14.520 --> 37:16.060
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL EVENING.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.730
CAREFUL THERE, MR. STRAZZA.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.400
UH, I THINK IT'S STRAT-ZA.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.320
AH! DON'T MOVE!

37:24.360 --> 37:26.370
OH! THOSE THINGS HAVE
A HAIR TRIGGER!

37:27.700 --> 37:30.120
YOU STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE!

37:30.160 --> 37:31.500
THE COPS ARE ON THEIR WAY!

37:31.540 --> 37:32.620
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

37:41.420 --> 37:42.800
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME, JAKE?

37:42.840 --> 37:44.130
LESLIE!

37:44.180 --> 37:46.510
SO SORRY THAT I HAD TO GET YOU
OUT OF YOUR NICE WARM BED.

37:46.550 --> 37:47.850
ALL THESE CARS JUST FOR US?

37:47.890 --> 37:50.260
I SUPPOSE YOU WERE LOOKIN'
FOR THE VEILED MADONNA?

37:50.310 --> 37:52.520
WHAT'RE THEY STILL DOING HERE?
I WANT THEM LOCKED UP!

37:52.560 --> 37:53.640
BOTH OF THEM!

37:53.680 --> 37:56.190
DON'T WORRY, PALLY.
THIS WAS ALL JUST A DIVERSION.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.520
WHAT?

37:58.560 --> 37:59.730
A DIVERSION.

37:59.770 --> 38:01.860
OUR PEOPLE ARE STEALING
THE VEILED MADONNA

38:01.900 --> 38:03.110
AS WE SPEAK.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.780
LOOK AT ALL THE POLICE CARS.

38:04.820 --> 38:06.570
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.620
BOTH OF YOU,
COME WITH ME NOW!

38:08.660 --> 38:10.990
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU!
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE!

38:11.040 --> 38:12.500
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.950
&lt;SIRENS BLARING&gt;

38:16.710 --> 38:18.000
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

38:18.040 --> 38:19.380
LESLIE, WE NEED A FAVOR.

38:19.420 --> 38:20.750
A FAVOR? IS THAT SO?

38:20.800 --> 38:23.050
LISTEN, ANTON STRAZZA
IS IN HIS CAR RIGHT NOW

38:23.090 --> 38:24.470
AND HE'S ABOUT TO DRIVE AWAY.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.760
LESLIE, YOU KNOW I NEVER
ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.010
PRETEND JAKE'S NOT HERE.
DO THIS FOR ME, PLEASE?

38:30.470 --> 38:31.850

38:31.890 --> 38:33.970
LOOK, HE'S DRIVING AWAY
AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM!

38:34.020 --> 38:36.310
PLEASE, PLEASE, TRUST ME.

38:36.350 --> 38:38.480
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS!

38:38.520 --> 38:39.440
THANK YOU.

38:40.690 --> 38:42.150
ARE YOU GONNA GET ME
OUT OF MY CUFFS?

38:42.190 --> 38:44.860
PUT... ARGH! I JUST NEED
TO GET OUTTA MY CUFFS.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.640
STOP RIGHT THERE!

39:15.430 --> 39:16.640
WELL, WHAT D'YA KNOW?

39:17.810 --> 39:19.400
I'LL TAKE THAT.

39:24.110 --> 39:25.150
HELLO, GIRL.

39:25.190 --> 39:26.780
CAREFUL THERE.
SHE'S ONE OF A KIND.

39:26.820 --> 39:28.610
MR. STRAZZA,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

39:28.650 --> 39:29.660
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.620
THE STATUE BELONGS TO ME.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.290
I WAS ONLY TAKING BACK
WHAT WAS MINE!

39:34.330 --> 39:37.500
YOU DIDN'T MIND SENDING
AN INNOCENT KID TO JAIL
IN THE PROCESS?

39:39.420 --> 39:41.080
ALTHOUGH SHE IS
KIND OF ATTRACTIVE.

39:42.670 --> 39:44.130
I MEAN, BEAUTIFUL.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.050
&lt;DOOR CLOSING&gt;

39:53.470 --> 39:55.010
WELL, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.560
I GUESS THE, UH...

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
THEY DIDN'T THROW YOU OUT
WITH THE REGULAR RIFF-RAFF?

39:58.640 --> 40:00.440
YEAH, KNOWING THE OWNER
HAS ITS PERKS, RIGHT?

40:02.690 --> 40:03.560
THIS FOR ME?

40:03.610 --> 40:04.980
YEAH.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.400
GOOD NIGHT?

40:07.610 --> 40:10.070
[JAKE] COULD BE WORSE.

40:10.110 --> 40:12.320
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
ANTON STRAZZA'S TALKING.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.780
WE'RE DROPPING ALL CHARGES
AGAINST DES.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.330
YEAH, I HEARD.

40:15.370 --> 40:16.620
LITTLE CONFUSED WHY
YOU'RE SO HELL-BENT

40:16.660 --> 40:18.790
ON SENDING DES TO JAIL,
THOUGH, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

40:18.830 --> 40:20.040
FELT A LITTLE PERSONAL.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.040
I WASN'T.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.170
THERE'S A BACKLOG OF CASES.
EVERYTHING IS RUSHED.

40:25.210 --> 40:28.340
THAT'S WHY I UPPED THE CHARGES
TO PISS OFF THE JUDGE.

40:28.380 --> 40:30.720
I WOULD RE-FILE,
THEY WOULD RE-SCHEDULE,

40:30.760 --> 40:33.470
AND EVENTUALLY IT WOULD'VE GOT
KICKED OUT, GUARANTEED.

40:33.510 --> 40:35.550
DES WOULD'VE ENDED
UP WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE.

40:39.180 --> 40:40.480
OH.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.270
AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

40:42.310 --> 40:44.310
WELL, THAT WAS MY PLAN,
ANYWAY.

40:44.360 --> 40:48.690
WELL, I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.
AND, UM... I'M SORRY.

40:50.860 --> 40:55.570
SIMON SHOWING UP JUST KINDA
THREW ME FOR A CURVE BALL,
YOU KNOW?

40:55.620 --> 40:58.490
I THOUGHT THAT THINGS
WERE DONE BETWEEN ME AND HIM.

40:59.700 --> 41:00.960
AND ARE THEY?

41:03.580 --> 41:05.040
TELL YOU WHAT.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.630
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A FEW DAYS,
TAKE SOME SPACE.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.510
"SPACE?"

41:11.550 --> 41:12.970
OKAY.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.640
ALLISON,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

41:28.190 --> 41:29.530
GOODNIGHT, JAKE.

41:41.500 --> 41:42.580
&lt;DOOR CLOSING&gt;

41:45.250 --> 41:47.750
[DES] OH, THANKS GUYS! OH!

41:47.790 --> 41:49.420
WICKED!
Y'KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

41:49.460 --> 41:51.590
I WAS THINKING NOW THAT I'VE
ACTUALLY DONE, LIKE,
SOME HARD TIME,

41:51.630 --> 41:54.630
MAYBE I CAN, UH, GET A
LITTLE BIT MORE ACTION?

41:55.090 --> 41:56.640
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

41:56.680 --> 41:57.600
POPPY?

41:57.640 --> 41:58.720
JUST A SMALL ONE FOR ME.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.390
OH, HEY. MAKE MINE
A DOUBLE, WOULD YOU?

42:01.430 --> 42:02.520
YOU WISH.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.310
[DES] A BIG... A TRIPLE EVEN.

42:04.350 --> 42:07.400
HEY, HEY! THERE HE IS!
WHAT'S UP?

42:07.440 --> 42:08.900
[MAL] SO, YOU'VE DECIDED
TO JOIN US?

42:08.940 --> 42:10.020
WHAT'LL IT BE?

42:10.070 --> 42:11.110
EH, WHATEVER'S GOING.

42:11.150 --> 42:12.650
[ROSE] WELL HERE, TAKE THAT.

42:12.690 --> 42:17.070
PERFECT. DES, OR WHATEVER
YOUR REAL NAME IS.

42:17.110 --> 42:19.580
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T EVEN CARE WHAT
YOUR REAL NAME IS.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.160
ME NEITHER.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.330
I WANT YOU TO MOVE OUTTA
THAT HOUSE RIGHT AWAY.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.290
[DES] YES SIR.

42:29.500 --> 42:32.000
OH LORD. THAT MEANS HE'S
GONNA BE MOVIN' IN WITH US.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.170
YEP, CAUSE HE'S
DEFINITELY NOT LIVING WITH ME.

42:34.210 --> 42:35.260
WHY NOT?

42:35.300 --> 42:36.510
I THINK I NEED A DRINK!

42:36.550 --> 42:38.640
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

42:38.680 --> 42:41.680
YOU'RE LIKE THE SON
I NEVER HAD.
WELCOME HOME, BOY.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.730
YEAH, COME HERE.

42:44.770 --> 42:45.680
[JAKE] WHAT KIND OF TOAST
IS THAT?

42:45.730 --> 42:47.190
[MAL] WELCOMING THE KID HOME!

42:47.230 --> 42:48.690
WHATEVER.

42:48.730 --> 42:51.690
YOUR FATHER SAYS HELLO.
JODY REDMOND.

42:52.860 --> 42:54.030
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

42:54.070 --> 42:55.110
THEY DON'T KNOW.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.660
I THOUGHT IF YOU KNEW,
THEN...

42:57.700 --> 43:00.200
NO. IT'S OKAY, I GET IT.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.750
IN THE JAIL CELL, I JUST
KEPT THINKING.

43:04.790 --> 43:08.000
I MEAN, WHAT IF IT'S,
WHAT IF IT'S PART OF MY GENES?
MY D.N.A.? I MEAN...

43:08.040 --> 43:09.630
NO, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
NO, NO, NO.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.880
I MEAN, WHAT IF IT'S MY
DESTINY OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

43:11.920 --> 43:15.170
NO, IT IS NOT. WE'LL
FIGURE OUT YOUR FATHER THING.

43:16.340 --> 43:18.380
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
COME HERE.

43:20.680 --> 43:24.220
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GO PAY YOUR
FATHER A LITTLE VISIT.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.520
O-OKAY.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.810
PROMISE. LET'S GET BACK
IN HERE.

43:27.850 --> 43:28.890
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

43:30.230 --> 43:32.400
[ROSE] WELL,
THAT WAS DELICIOUS!

43:32.900 --> 43:34.690
&lt;CHATTERING&gt;
