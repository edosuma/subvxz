<i>PHIL KEOGHAN:
Previously on The Amazing Race...</i>

00:03.408 --> 00:05.527
<i>..six teams
race to Bali, Indonesia...</i>

00:05.528 --> 00:06.807
All ready!

00:07.041 --> 00:08.720
<i>..Tyler and Korey
made new friends...</i>

00:09.006 --> 00:10.157
Oh, my God!

00:10.222 --> 00:11.607
Oh!

00:12.190 --> 00:15.389
<i>..at a gruelling Roadblock
Rachel struggled to keep up.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:16.509
(WEAKLY) I can't, babe.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.379
Oh, Zach!

00:18.380 --> 00:22.109
<i>..and a second Roadblock put Brodie
and Kurt in unfamiliar territory...</i>

00:22.110 --> 00:24.029
I tied them wrong.
Arggh!

00:24.030 --> 00:25.189
This is unbelievable.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.629
It's going to be really close.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.949
Come on, Brodes!

00:27.950 --> 00:29.749
<i>..Tyler and Korey won the leg...</i>

00:29.750 --> 00:32.549
Hey! Guess what.
You are team number one!

00:32.549 --> 00:34.269
Yay!

00:34.270 --> 00:38.869
<i>..while Brodie and Kurt
narrowly edged out Zach and Rachel.</i>

00:38.870 --> 00:40.709
Unfortunately,
you are the last team to arrive.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.269
You have been
eliminated from the race.

00:42.270 --> 00:46.029
<i>Five teams remain.
Who will be eliminated next?</i>

00:46.030 --> 00:48.590
The dragon looks like
one of Tyler's ex-boyfriends.

01:40.714 --> 01:41.714
We're on a boat.

01:41.715 --> 01:43.073
Uh, like a pirate ship.

01:43.074 --> 01:44.353
This is where we slept all night.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.673
It was amazing.

01:45.674 --> 01:48.953
It was probably one of
the most restful nights I've had

01:48.954 --> 01:50.873
the entire time I was on the race.

01:50.874 --> 01:53.473
Slowly being rocked back and forth.

01:53.474 --> 01:55.553
(SNORES)
-Hearing Brodie snore.

01:55.554 --> 01:57.234
(CONTINUES SNORING)

02:03.794 --> 02:04.833
Where are we going?

02:04.834 --> 02:07.233
There are so many islands
in Indonesia

02:07.234 --> 02:09.433
that if you were to visit
a new one every day

02:09.434 --> 02:12.713
it would take you almost 50 years
to see them all.

02:12.714 --> 02:17.073
<i>Tyler and Korey will be the first
to visit this one - Nusa Lembongan.</i>

02:17.074 --> 02:20.553
<i>They'll find their next clue
in one of these three Clue Boxes</i>

02:20.554 --> 02:22.833
<i>in this vivid aqua blue bay.</i>

02:22.834 --> 02:24.633
"Caution, U-Turn ahead."
-Oh, my God.

02:24.634 --> 02:25.873
There's a U-Turn, dude.

02:25.874 --> 02:26.874
In the last leg,

02:26.875 --> 02:28.473
every team finished
within 15 minutes,

02:28.474 --> 02:30.553
so it was a really close race.

02:30.554 --> 02:33.873
There's a U-Turn and Brodie
and Kurt are in last place,

02:33.874 --> 02:35.873
which is kind of overwhelming!

02:35.874 --> 02:36.874
Gamma Bay.

02:38.299 --> 02:42.255
Brodie and Kurt are bringing
up the rear today. -U-turnable.

02:44.714 --> 02:45.783
"Caution."
-"U-Turn ahead."

02:45.784 --> 02:47.513
Alright. Let's get started.
Let's go, babe.

02:47.514 --> 02:49.033
Let's get out of here.
-Let's go.

02:49.034 --> 02:51.033
Today we are leaving
in second place.

02:51.034 --> 02:52.473
It's our fourth
second place in a row...

02:52.474 --> 02:53.474
Fourth.

02:53.475 --> 02:55.193
..which means that we are currently

02:55.194 --> 02:56.553
the most consistent team.

02:56.554 --> 02:57.713
We're used to playing games

02:57.714 --> 03:01.433
and U-Turns are a huge part
of the game of The Amazing Race.

03:01.434 --> 03:02.873
And we look at it just the way

03:02.874 --> 03:04.873
we look at any other big piece
on the board.

03:04.874 --> 03:06.633
You earn it by getting to it first.

03:06.634 --> 03:07.873
I just think there's
a lot more teams

03:07.874 --> 03:10.033
that are going to be willing
to use it offensively

03:10.034 --> 03:11.034
this late in the race.

03:12.314 --> 03:13.753
Good?
-Yep.

03:13.754 --> 03:15.993
COLE: We have been the underdogs
the entire time,

03:15.994 --> 03:17.953
and now here we are in the top five.

03:17.954 --> 03:21.273
SHERI: Definitely the positive
thinking helps us go a long way.

03:21.274 --> 03:25.193
We got third last leg, so no doubt
we're getting second this leg.

03:25.194 --> 03:26.394
And by second I mean first.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.233
"Caution, U-Turn ahead."

03:29.234 --> 03:30.713
Alright, babe. Let's go.
-Alright.

03:30.714 --> 03:32.633
U-Turn ahead. Holy crap.

03:32.634 --> 03:33.873
We've got to get out of the back.

03:33.874 --> 03:37.153
A bit scary to be towards the back
when there's a U-Turn.

03:37.154 --> 03:38.393
It's so late in the game,

03:38.394 --> 03:41.033
I think someone
will play a U-Turn to stay safe,

03:41.034 --> 03:44.553
so we got to try to make up some
time and get to that U-Turn board.

03:44.554 --> 03:46.793
Let's go.
"Caution, U-Turn ahead."

03:46.794 --> 03:48.873
Aw, man.
We've got to go, Brodie.

03:48.874 --> 03:50.633
Right now we're starting off
in last place,

03:50.634 --> 03:52.913
so not exactly where we want to be.

03:52.914 --> 03:55.193
I think we definitely
have a target on our back,

03:55.194 --> 03:57.193
so Brodie and I are going to
make up some time right now

03:57.194 --> 03:59.353
and get to the U-Turn mat
as quickly as we can.

03:59.354 --> 04:02.793
This is not the leg you want to be
last, but we're in this position.

04:02.794 --> 04:04.474
We're just going to
try to fight out of it.

04:08.754 --> 04:10.713
Do you see it, Ty?
-No.

04:10.714 --> 04:12.233
It's over there on the left.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.713
"Search for your clue
near the marked buoy."

04:13.714 --> 04:16.072
It's on the ocean floor
near that marked buoy.

04:16.074 --> 04:18.873
Oh, my God.
Korey, you go first.

04:18.874 --> 04:20.913
I'm a little nervous.

04:20.914 --> 04:21.952
(LAUGHS)

04:21.954 --> 04:23.114
Here we go.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.583
Yeah?
-It's fine.

04:26.584 --> 04:27.584
Bye!

04:33.314 --> 04:35.233
KOREY: It was just water everywhere.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.633
We were hoping for a leg where
we had a lot of water challenges.

04:38.634 --> 04:41.074
It was beautiful scenery,
we saw everything.

04:42.554 --> 04:43.583
TYLER: We found the clue.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.753
There were only a couple clues
per Clue Box,

04:45.754 --> 04:48.874
so there was definitely an advantage
to showing up earlier...

04:49.068 --> 04:52.393
You got it? -Got it.
-Let's go back to the boat.

04:52.428 --> 04:54.381
..because if you open a Clue Box
and there's nothing in it,

04:54.464 --> 04:55.513
you could kind of freak out,

04:55.514 --> 04:57.583
you could be frantic
trying to find that clue,

04:57.584 --> 04:58.994
so we were feeling pretty good.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.064
Korey, you killed that.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.194
I see them up here. Ready?

05:06.074 --> 05:08.155
I see Tyler and Kory's boat.

05:08.190 --> 05:09.553
I think that's Korey right there.

05:09.554 --> 05:10.994
Do see the buoy?
-I think I do.

05:13.954 --> 05:17.553
"Make your way to the bottom
of the Pura Puseh stairway."

05:17.554 --> 05:21.033
<i>PHIL: Teams must now make their way
to Pura Puseh stairway</i>

05:21.034 --> 05:23.673
<i>and find the dancing monkey
to receive their next clue.</i>

05:23.674 --> 05:26.433
Snorkelling was actually a lot
easier than I thought it would be.

05:26.434 --> 05:27.434
Jump off!
-Jump off!

05:30.794 --> 05:32.433
ASHLEY: We've both snorkelled
before,

05:32.434 --> 05:34.713
so the gear was all very familiar.

05:34.714 --> 05:36.993
We did see the fish
and saw some of the reef.

05:36.994 --> 05:40.913
I couldn't resist taking just
a very brief dive down to enjoy it

05:40.914 --> 05:41.914
while we were there.

05:43.794 --> 05:45.473
BURNIE: It wasn't tough till you
open that Clue Box

05:45.474 --> 05:46.993
and you looked in there,

05:46.994 --> 05:48.433
there were just the cylinders.

05:48.434 --> 05:50.994
It looked unlike any other clue
we've seen so far.

05:54.156 --> 05:56.795
Mom, marked clue is here.

05:56.874 --> 05:59.381
You're a great snorkeler!
-Thanks, babe.

05:59.554 --> 06:01.473
(SHOUTS) We can get in the water?
-Yep.

06:01.474 --> 06:05.313
SHERI: I haven't snorkelled
in over 20-something years.

06:05.314 --> 06:07.154
And I haven't real snorkelled ever.

06:08.874 --> 06:11.474
"Make your way to the bottom
of Pura Puseh stairway."

06:13.114 --> 06:15.713
I find a Clue Box pretty fast
and I open it,

06:15.714 --> 06:19.673
but I'm looking for a laminated clue
thing that's down in there.

06:19.674 --> 06:21.633
Nothing in there, so I leave.

06:21.634 --> 06:24.633
Find a second one, open it.
That was, like, nothing.

06:24.634 --> 06:28.074
I think I might have looked at more
fish than actually the Clue Boxes.

06:29.994 --> 06:32.553
How beautiful.
-Where's the other boats?

06:32.554 --> 06:34.073
They're all right there.

06:34.074 --> 06:35.114
Right there?
-Yeah.

06:37.194 --> 06:39.154
Is that the way you have to get off?

06:40.474 --> 06:42.273
Oh, I see one!

06:42.274 --> 06:44.353
Mom, I got one!

06:44.354 --> 06:47.353
So then I went to a third Clue Box.
There's, like, two pipes in there.

06:47.354 --> 06:49.753
But I thought the pipes
were just holding the Clue Box down,

06:49.754 --> 06:51.393
so I reach in and grab the pipe,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.194
I'm like,
"Oh! This is obviously it."

06:53.554 --> 06:55.267
Mom, I got a clue.

06:59.754 --> 07:01.514
Large buoy over there. Right there.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.433
Mushroom Beach on Lembongan.
Mushroom Beach!

07:06.434 --> 07:09.153
Over there, babe.
That's the large buoy.

07:09.154 --> 07:11.113
When we jumped in the water

07:11.114 --> 07:13.553
the Dancers were still swimming
towards the buoy.

07:13.554 --> 07:15.473
So, I'm a good swimmer,
I was going to get to that fast,

07:15.474 --> 07:16.474
so we felt confident.

07:16.475 --> 07:18.873
Like, "We're going to get this
faster than the Dancers."

07:18.874 --> 07:20.113
Nothing in there, Brodie?

07:20.114 --> 07:21.713
MATT: We got to the
snorkelling spot.

07:21.714 --> 07:25.433
As soon as we jumped in, I actually
got one really quickly,

07:25.434 --> 07:26.913
but we were a little confused.

07:26.914 --> 07:27.993
We were looking for, like,

07:27.994 --> 07:30.473
maybe a laminated clue
or something like that

07:30.474 --> 07:32.194
and it was just these canisters.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.818
Do you see anything else?
I literally don't see anything else.

07:34.919 --> 07:35.819
I don't see anything else.

07:35.954 --> 07:39.033
There was a point where Matt and I
bumped into each other in the water,

07:39.034 --> 07:40.953
and Matt kind of came up,
I came out,

07:40.954 --> 07:44.513
and he held up one of the yellow
boxes and was like, "Is this it?"

07:44.514 --> 07:45.793
This can't be right.

07:45.794 --> 07:47.313
And it just registered.

07:47.314 --> 07:49.273
"Oh, I think we just passed one."

07:49.274 --> 07:51.434
So, I mean, we swam back
about 10 seconds.

07:52.594 --> 07:53.993
Got it?
-Yeah.

07:53.994 --> 07:55.554
Alright. Let's go!

07:57.874 --> 07:59.833
They passed us.
-This is bad.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.633
Falling into the back
on a U-Turn leg, it's not good.

08:02.634 --> 08:05.913
Mushroom Beach on Lembongan.
-OK.

08:05.914 --> 08:07.914
Go, go, go! Thanks, man!

08:10.968 --> 08:13.115
Did they not get the clue?
-Are you sure that wasn't it?

08:13.274 --> 08:15.753
(ANGRILY) I'm not sure!
Stop asking me!

08:15.754 --> 08:17.553
We've got to pay attention
to who's behind us

08:17.554 --> 08:19.954
and if we get a U-Turn
we know who to use it on.

08:21.074 --> 08:23.353
Is this Bali Hai Resort?

08:23.354 --> 08:24.354
Nice.

08:24.355 --> 08:25.953
Ready?
-Yeah.

08:25.954 --> 08:29.193
Look for a marked truck taxi.

08:29.194 --> 08:30.793
Oh! There they are.
They just got here.

08:30.794 --> 08:31.794
They just got here, yeah.

08:31.795 --> 08:33.393
Alright. Come on, babe.

08:33.394 --> 08:34.472
Is this it?

08:34.474 --> 08:36.863
Yes, yes, yes! I see him there.

08:36.864 --> 08:37.982
They just ran that way.
Perfect!

08:37.984 --> 08:39.222
There they are.

08:39.224 --> 08:40.832
Move fast!

08:40.833 --> 08:42.193
Hey, guys.

08:42.193 --> 08:44.593
We just saw Tyler and Korey
leaving the parking lot, so...

08:44.594 --> 08:45.983
We have made up a lot of time
on that one.

08:45.984 --> 08:46.984
We've made up great time.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.033
You got it out of a Clue Box?
How could it not be it?

08:50.034 --> 08:51.034
I don't know.

08:51.035 --> 08:52.223
I feel like
that really could be it.

08:52.224 --> 08:53.833
I don't think this is it.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.033
We're just last, so the Clue Box
is going to be hard to find.

08:57.034 --> 08:58.153
We're last.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.593
I don't think these are right.
I don't know.

08:59.594 --> 09:01.353
What did Kurt and Brodie have?
Did you see?

09:01.354 --> 09:04.273
No. If the frisbee guys
were able to U-Turn somebody,

09:04.274 --> 09:05.714
we would be the next target.

09:05.815 --> 09:07.747
I think all these clues are taken.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.919
I don't think this is it.
-I don't think so either.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.240
We're just last.

09:15.241 --> 09:17.041
I think all these clues are taken.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.639
Oh, wait.
-Does that open?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.399
No, you're kidding me!

09:21.400 --> 09:24.639
Oh!
-Oh, God. OK. Hold on.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.079
"Make your way to the bottom
of the Pura Puseh stairway."

09:28.080 --> 09:31.239
DANA: That was stressful because
we do something correctly

09:31.240 --> 09:32.919
and we doubt
we've done it correctly.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.360
And so a lot of the time we're just
shooting ourselves in the foot.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
(ROARS)

09:40.121 --> 09:41.999
(LAUGHS)

09:42.000 --> 09:44.599
We don't have dancing monkeys
in Alabama.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.159
We don't have monkeys in general.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.919
We go to the zoo.
-We go to the zoo.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.359
Oh!
-Want to just go up here, Brodie?

09:50.360 --> 09:53.079
Yeah, whoo!

09:53.080 --> 09:54.670
What about Puseh?
-Whoo!

09:59.520 --> 10:01.599
Pura Puseh stairway, Ty.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.519
But you can't approach it
with your sarong.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.079
Hi! Thank you.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.639
You know,
our sarongs look pretty good.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.879
Pink is our colour.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.519
Beautiful.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.549
They were not sa-wrong.
There were definitely...

10:12.550 --> 10:13.719
Sa-right?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.479
Sa-right.
They were definitely sa-right.

I hate you.

Looking for a dancing monkey.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.030
It's going to be
all the way up there.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.359
Ah! Dancing monkey.
-Dancing monkey.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.839
I see a clue.
-Catch him. Get it, Kore!

Give me the clue!
What are you doing?

You want to give me that?

seaweed.</i>

-'Haul'.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.999
Can we carry 50 coconuts
and four chickens?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.519
Yeah, let's do it.
-Good?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.679
It's not so many stairs.
-(PANTS) Nope.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.319

at the top.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.720
Yeah. It seems awesome.

-That way.

or do want to carry coconuts?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.199
I can do chickens pretty easy,
I think.

That's the bridge. Right here.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.839
OK. Go, go, go!

So, there's the suspension bridge.

We're out in front.

so we needed to stay

as far ahead of those other teams
as we could.

They're beautiful chickens.

KOREY: I think it was
a benefit to go first

13:06.400 --> 13:08.199
because when Ashley and I
got in the pen,

13:08.200 --> 13:09.959
there were a ton of chickens
in there

13:09.960 --> 13:13.559
and it was very easy to figure out
which ones were just very relaxed

13:13.560 --> 13:14.919

18:54.040 --> 18:56.749
Cole, open this. Two chickens.

18:56.750 --> 19:00.319
Two chickens, five coconuts.

19:00.320 --> 19:03.469
What a little sweetheart
of a chicken you are, huh?

19:03.470 --> 19:05.119
Do you like your walk
across the bridge?

19:05.120 --> 19:06.229
Everyone's here.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.399
This I love, everyone came here.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.229
That means we know we're in first.

19:09.230 --> 19:10.749
Be careful.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.119
(COLE SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

19:13.120 --> 19:15.199
Good job. Oh, my God.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.989
Dana?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.959
MATT: So, we had other teams running
by us shaking the bridge.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.989
Sorry.
Ty, one more trip after this.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.319
Dana?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.039
Tyler has four.
I have four.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.639
13 more coconuts.
Six.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.879
Hustle now. Killing it, Kore.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.959
Four, five, six, seven.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.679
How about this basket?
Yes, Mr Chicken.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.319
We have nine total.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.359
Five and four.
-On this trip.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.399
So, now we're 27 total.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.520
They look like the twins
from The Shining.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.750
Only the mean chickens are left.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.519
(CHICKENS CLUCK)

19:52.520 --> 19:53.799
(COCKEREL CROWS)

19:53.800 --> 19:56.399
Come on! One of you chickens
is coming with me!

19:56.400 --> 19:58.879
I got you. I got you. I got you.
(CHICKEN CLUCKS HYSTERICALLY)

19:58.880 --> 20:01.279
OK, mamma chicken,
look how nice I am.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.399
Come on, Dana.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.470
Shut up, Matt. Seriously, shut up.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.679
On your left. Are you with me?

20:09.680 --> 20:12.159
Good job, Ty, good job.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.520
50.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.079
Good job.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.639
Thank you so much.
-Thank you. Thank you, sir.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.749
<i>PHIL: Teams must now make their way
to Warung Sunrise,</i>

20:23.750 --> 20:25.469
<i>where they'll find
the Double U-Turn.</i>

20:25.470 --> 20:27.399
With only two legs remaining,

20:27.400 --> 20:31.039
two teams can use the U-turn
to help eliminate their competition.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.989
We're leaving in first.
I feel so good about that.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.719
The U-Turn mat's going to be
up here, it always is.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.599
Three, four, five, six.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.839
We've got 30.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.199
Alright, let's go.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.229
Three, four, five, six, seven.
Eight.

20:45.230 --> 20:46.469
And chicken.

20:46.470 --> 20:49.469
OK, we have four and four.

20:49.470 --> 20:52.919
That puts us at 43 total.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.599
OK, big leg, last leg.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.799
Cole, you're a machine.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.920
Great job, guys.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.959
This is it?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.359
U-Turn, right there.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.959
Oh, my God.
-Should we do it?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.719
It's a Double U-turn.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.399
I think Brodie and Kurt.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.749
You make the call.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.439
I kind of think use it.
-OK.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.229
You feel OK with it?

21:14.230 --> 21:16.119
OK. If you say yes, let's do it.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.279
We're doing it.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.879
We love 'em, but if we want
a chance in the finals,

21:18.880 --> 21:20.159
they're the biggest threat.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.679
They've gotten the most number ones.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.320
We've got to do it.
Here's our clue.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.919
"Make your way to Pande Curly
Shop Stand-Up Paddleboards.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.229
"on the beach in Mushroom Bay
and find your next clue."

21:32.230 --> 21:33.600
Oh, God.
We had to, Kore.

21:35.470 --> 21:37.399
OK, she has four.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.599
I have four, so that puts us at 51?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.359
OK. We have one extra.
-Whoo-hoo.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.599
That looks so pretty.
"Make your way to Warung Sunrise

21:44.600 --> 21:45.959
"and search for your next clue."

21:45.960 --> 21:48.519
Alright. Let's go. Where's our guy?

21:48.520 --> 21:51.199
Oh, we are second out of the Detour
and everyone did this Detour,

21:51.200 --> 21:54.880
so this is a good thing,
because we know where everyone is.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.559
How do you feel?

21:58.560 --> 22:00.279
You regret it?

22:00.280 --> 22:03.519
No, I just, it was a Double U-Turn,
so if somebody else U-turns

22:03.520 --> 22:06.679
Sheri and Cole or the Dancers,
Brodie and Kurt could stay alive.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.399
They're going to know we're there,
'cause our picture's on the board.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.719
I'm just saying, if this is going to
give us the lead,

22:11.720 --> 22:14.959
you know what I mean?
Don't make me regret it.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.600
I'm not... No regrets.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.519
After we played the U-Turn,

22:26.520 --> 22:28.239
we had a little bit
of a panic moment,

22:28.240 --> 22:29.479
then it finally clicked.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.679
If Burnie and Ashley are smart,
they could U-turn us,

22:32.680 --> 22:34.719
just so no-one else can use it.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.119
If he did, that would be smart
for every team.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.359
Yeah.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.599
Is this it? We here? Warung Sunrise?

22:41.600 --> 22:43.719
OK, U-Turn times two.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.839
(GASPS)
Oh, they U-turned Brodie and Kurt.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.199
Well, that saves us.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.759
So, Brodie and Kurt,
the only way they stand a chance

22:49.760 --> 22:51.199
is if they U-turn somebody else.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.399
Let's U-turn Tyler and Korey.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.079
To make sure that they can't?
-Yes.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.559
And then the little one goes where?
Here, just right here.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.999
So, that way, no more U-Turns.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.839
"Make your way to Punde Curly Shop

23:00.840 --> 23:02.479
"Stand-Up Paddleboards
on the beach."

23:02.480 --> 23:05.079
Historically, Brodie and Kurt can
get through Detours really fast,

23:05.080 --> 23:08.599
so they could survive this U-Turn,
but if they do,

23:08.600 --> 23:09.880
they won't be mad at us.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.039
These are so big.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.039
Makes it so much harder
for me to carry.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.879
Power through, baby, power through.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.239
All the way in, bro.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.559
Five and five. Five and five.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.159
One, two, three, four, five.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.679
Four, five.
-50.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.039
Yes, yeah, my man!

23:28.040 --> 23:30.839
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.039
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

23:33.040 --> 23:35.079
How did they get 50 coconuts
so fast?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.719
'Cause they have longer arms, baby.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.439
I'm guessing the U-Turn's
probably next.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
The U-Turn's here.

23:40.441 --> 23:42.919
Right now, I'm just going to pray
that we don't get U-turned.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.079
We feel like Burnie and Ashley
would never U-turn us,

23:45.080 --> 23:48.000
but Tyler and Korey
are kind of a mystery.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.759
Which way do you want to go?
I don't know.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.359
Shall I ask this guy?
Yeah. Ask him.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.359
Do you know Punde Curly Shop
Stand-Up Paddleboards?

23:58.360 --> 24:00.280
Right here? Oh, yeah, I see it, Ty.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.039
Thank you. Thank you.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.959
Ready?
-It's a Roadblock, you're doing it.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.279
Oh, my God.
-Tyler has to do it.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.679
"Who's feeling blue?"

24:10.680 --> 24:14.800
PHIL: This Roadblock is guaranteed
to test teams' fear of heights.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.120
A four-story leap from
Jump Rock into Blue Lagoon.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.759
We've got to head
to the Blue Lagoon.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.160
I'm about to climb up
and jump off.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.719
Over here?
We're here, let's go.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.800
Go.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.039
Oh, crap, we got U-turned.
We got U-turned.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.399
U-turned times two.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.639
This means that we got U-turned
by Tyler and Korey.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.079
KURT: Burnie and Ashley
U-turned Tyler and Korey,

24:42.080 --> 24:43.799
knowing that they were
ahead of them.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.439
So, we've got to go.
We've got to go.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.879
Back to the other Detour.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.959
They did the move to get us
eliminated, let's go.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.879
Alright, seaweed.
-Frick!

24:50.880 --> 24:53.279
We need to go to the seaweed,
seaweed?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.440
Oh, if we come out of this...

24:57.520 --> 25:00.359
Nine, 10.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.519
How many coconuts is that for us?

25:02.520 --> 25:03.879
40.
-Think it's 40.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.999
These are heavy. My arms are tired.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.439
Listen, I don't like it any more
than you do, chick.

25:10.440 --> 25:15.199
Four, five, six
and Dana had seven, so 33.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.040
Two more trips and we're done.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.679
This it?
-Yeah, this is it.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.319
Seaweed?
-Come on, Brodie, let's go.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.160
Do or die, baby. Do or die.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.719
Hello!

25:30.720 --> 25:32.999
Brodie, it's really slippery,
be careful!

25:33.000 --> 25:35.039
That's why I'm going slow. Whoa!

25:35.040 --> 25:36.959
Going slow. Going slow.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.959
What do we do once
we're in the boat?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.839
"Pull your boat carefully
along the marked channel"

25:40.840 --> 25:42.719
"between... One of the marked
seaweed carriers."

25:42.720 --> 25:44.239
So we're going all the way
down here?

25:44.240 --> 25:45.519
Let's just push it out.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.079
We're going down that channel.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.959
You go left, I go right.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.879
Dude, it's easier if you just kind
of do this, just spin it over.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.679
KURT: We just kind of looked
at each other,

25:54.680 --> 25:56.319
"Let's go do this Detour,
let's knock this out."

25:56.320 --> 25:58.079
'Cause we knew we just had
to continue to race hard

25:58.080 --> 25:59.359
if we wanted to stay in it,

25:59.360 --> 26:02.039
'cause you never know with this race
if we can make up that time.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.439
I think it's to where
the red flags are.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.479
Let's get a whole lot
so we just get it done, one take.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.040
Yeah.
This it? Right here.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.519
It's tied to, like, the rope.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.519
Brodie, check this out.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.279
You pull this off,
you just get the whole thing.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.999
There we go. There we go.
There we go.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.639
Nice, Kurt. -Just do this
Look, look, look.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.480
Look how easy this is.
Ooh, look at this long seaweed.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.919
This is the last of them.
-Seven...

26:31.920 --> 26:34.119
Eight, nine...
-Ten.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.519
That's 50.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.639
The best part was hauling
the chickens.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.679
I wish it was, "Haul 50 chickens
and four coconuts."

26:42.680 --> 26:45.599
Alright. 10.
-10. We have 43.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.359
Seven coconuts
and a chicken to carry.

26:48.360 --> 26:49.960
I'm out of gas a little bit.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.559
Alright, read it.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.879
Are these people
who got U-turned?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.839
I honestly don't know how
this works, but...

26:57.840 --> 26:59.839
Burnie and Ashley
U-turned Tyler and Korey.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.279
We don't know.
I have no idea.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.599
This is very confusing.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.799
I was trying to understand
the chart,

27:04.800 --> 27:07.119
but our name
wasn't anywhere on there

27:07.120 --> 27:09.560
and there are no available spaces,
so we knew what that meant.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.079
Go, Brodie, I got it.
-Dude, these are easy to untie.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.399
I just got another one.
-Exactly. Here. Give it to me.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.039
I'm thinking if we fill this whole
thing up, we should be good.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.439
BRODIE: Some of the lines
had more seaweed than others.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.999
So, I think we were doing a good job
to, you know,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.919
starting to pick the ones that had,
like, meatier seaweed, if you will.

27:29.920 --> 27:34.359
Show your bait.
Oh, yeah, seaweed moisturiser.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.119
So much seaweed!

27:36.120 --> 27:37.479
Why are we going this way?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.079
Because you keep pushing on that
side.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.719
Push out.
I can't, I'm in the back,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.199
if I push out, the other leg...

27:42.200 --> 27:43.599
I'm not doing anything,
this is all you.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.319
Brodie, we are freaking stuck.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.519
This is freaking stupid.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.599
We're getting freaky.
We're going backwards.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.399
We're getting freaky.
Going backwards.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.199
So much easier going backwards!
Whoo!

27:54.200 --> 27:55.719
"Load up both baskets."

27:55.720 --> 27:58.839
KURT: We had these baskets
that when we got back to shore,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.359
we had to take them
on our shoulders

28:00.360 --> 28:02.959
and put them and place them
on this giant tarp.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.239
Kurt, it's over here.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.519
Come on.
There's all these tarps over here.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.039
Right here, Kurt.
There's the example.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.479
So, here, that's what
you're going to do.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.519
Dump and I'll start spreading.
-Go, just dump.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.599
I'll start spreading.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.640
We're probably going to need
more seaweed.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.719
Excuse me.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.239
Thank you.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.759
They're slipping.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.679
It's OK.
This is the home stretch, baby.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.759
Which one?

28:24.760 --> 28:27.199
OK, OK, OK. It's OK, it's OK.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.319
I know this sucks, Mr Chicken.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.719
Six, seven.
-Chicken number four.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.039
Thank you so much.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.039
We just finished that detour.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.080
It was really hell.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.479
We have to spread this real good.
Spread it out more, bro.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.759
Brodie, I'm trying.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.439
You're doing it too much.
Come on, let's go back.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.480
We still need to get more.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.879
We might not even have
enough seaweed.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.479
I think we might. It'll be close.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.360
That guy had it super spread out.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.679
We're in last and it's definitely
not easy to be in last

28:57.680 --> 28:58.959
at a U-Turn leg, so...

28:58.960 --> 29:01.079
We're ready to be positive
and hope we didn't get U-turned.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.759
Is this it?

29:02.760 --> 29:07.239
It looks like Tyler and Korey
U-turned Brodie and Kurt?

29:07.240 --> 29:09.039
Alright, we're OK, we're OK.
-We're good, right?

29:09.040 --> 29:11.039
We didn't get U-turned.
-Get the clue, over there.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.239
Wow, they burned the U-Turn.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.679
That was nice of them.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.799
I'm so happy that
we didn't get U-turned.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.239
That was a saving grace for us.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.400
Yeah, it's saved us today.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.639
Roadblock.
I'm probably just going to do it.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.879
You do it, baby.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.239
"Who's feeling blue?

29:27.240 --> 29:29.799
"Scale the cliffs of Blue Lagoon
and take a 40 foot flight..."

29:29.800 --> 29:31.479
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.519
Scale a cliff and jump off.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.679
I'm like panicking,
because I'm scared of heights.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.519
Ahh!
-I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.800
Ahhh!

29:46.818 --> 29:50.497
We decided before the race
even started that anything jumping,

29:50.498 --> 29:51.897
I was going to do.

29:52.177 --> 29:55.936
And then it says scale a cliff
and jump off of it into...

29:55.937 --> 29:57.816
(LAUGHS) ..into the water.

29:57.817 --> 29:59.456
Don't think about it. Just do it.

29:59.457 --> 30:01.057
Just do it.

30:04.737 --> 30:08.096
I didn't use the U-Turn
for Cole to not jump.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.976
TYLER: Cole has said
how terrified he is of heights.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.816
We did not use the U-Turn
for Cole to not jump off a cliff.

30:14.817 --> 30:17.496
I was just going to freak out
if either Brodie or Kurt pass him

30:17.497 --> 30:19.057
and stay in the race.

30:20.617 --> 30:21.777
40 feet.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.136
Oh, Tyler.

30:25.137 --> 30:27.896
Look at the guy
getting ready to jump.

30:27.897 --> 30:30.056
Is he cute? He looks cute.

30:30.057 --> 30:32.616
Let's go.
-You've got it, Ty.

30:32.617 --> 30:34.776
I am so jealous right now.

30:34.777 --> 30:36.096
You got it, Ty!

30:36.097 --> 30:37.296
Let's do it!

30:37.297 --> 30:38.937
This looks insane.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.457
You've got it, Ty!

30:49.817 --> 30:50.817
Oh, my God.

30:50.818 --> 30:52.496
Tyler's climbing the ladder.

30:52.497 --> 30:56.016
Looks like Burnie and Ashley
are right behind us.

30:56.017 --> 30:57.336
Kill it!

30:57.337 --> 30:58.416
You're awesome. I love you.

30:58.417 --> 30:59.456
I love you.
-You've got this.

30:59.457 --> 31:01.576
Did you U-Turn us?

31:01.577 --> 31:03.296
Yes!

31:03.297 --> 31:04.896
Thank you!

31:04.897 --> 31:07.456
We were hoping you would.

31:07.457 --> 31:08.457
Come over.

31:08.458 --> 31:10.376
We're just going to do
a couple of exercises first

31:10.377 --> 31:11.377
just before we go.

31:11.378 --> 31:13.056
As soon as I got to the top,

31:13.057 --> 31:15.816
it was just a couple of stretches
with some instructor.

31:15.817 --> 31:17.456
OK. Just bring the knees to bend.

31:17.457 --> 31:18.856
OK. Good.

31:18.857 --> 31:20.936
To be honest, he got my attention.

31:20.937 --> 31:25.056
(LAUGHS) This guy had body-ody-ody.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.457
Body for days.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.056
Yeah, Brodes! Let's go, baby.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.496
My man!

31:33.497 --> 31:35.496
I think we've got enough seaweed
for you.

31:35.497 --> 31:37.096
At least, I just hope.

31:37.097 --> 31:39.056
No blue tarp.

31:39.057 --> 31:41.097
Yup, we've got a lot of seaweed
over here.

31:42.737 --> 31:44.136
Just get this done.

31:44.137 --> 31:45.257
Alright.

31:46.257 --> 31:47.976
Good?

31:47.977 --> 31:49.416
Yes!
-Yeah!

31:49.417 --> 31:50.816
Love it!
-Oh, face cream, I need some.

31:50.817 --> 31:53.136
Face cream, my girlfriend
would love this facemask.

31:53.137 --> 31:54.416
Let's go!

31:54.417 --> 31:55.776
Oh, yes.
-We need it all.

31:55.777 --> 31:58.216
We need it. It's been a long day.
-Yeah!

31:58.217 --> 32:00.056
Alright, crushing this right.
-I'll do the eyebrows.

32:00.057 --> 32:01.976
Let's go, Kurt, let's go.
-Let's go. Clue?

32:01.977 --> 32:03.656
Oh, thank you.
-Thank you, man.

32:03.657 --> 32:05.016
My man!

32:05.017 --> 32:06.456
Thank you, thank you.
-Pound it. Yes.

32:06.457 --> 32:07.457
Thank you, thank you.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.776
Thank you, guys!

32:08.777 --> 32:10.296
Here we go, Brodes. Come on.

32:10.297 --> 32:11.377
We're still on it. Come on!

32:12.857 --> 32:14.616
OK. Roadblock. What do you think?

32:14.617 --> 32:15.776
Shall I do it?
-Yeah, you do it.

32:15.777 --> 32:16.817
Alright. I'll do it.

32:18.417 --> 32:21.176
I put all this face cream on
because we're last

32:21.177 --> 32:23.176
and we need some good luck
right now.

32:23.177 --> 32:25.697
'Cause green slime, everyone knows,
is a good luck charm.

32:26.977 --> 32:28.697
We'll be back. We'll be right back!

32:30.497 --> 32:33.337
"Make your way to Pande Curly
Shop Stand Up Paddleboards."

32:34.857 --> 32:37.016
So with Tyler and Korey,
no hard feelings

32:37.017 --> 32:38.497
but at the same time, it's like...

32:39.657 --> 32:42.777
It kind of was a sucky move to do,
I guess.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.296
Come up to a standing position.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.976
Off you go.

32:47.977 --> 32:50.296
Off I go?
-Off you go.

32:50.297 --> 32:51.696
He's up there.

32:51.697 --> 32:52.897
Oh, my God.

32:54.657 --> 32:55.657
Holy crap!

32:55.658 --> 32:58.576
TYLER: As soon as I look over,
I saw Ashley arrive.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.136
(ASHLEY SCREAMS)

33:00.137 --> 33:01.896
And I just need to do this.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.417
Oh, my God!

33:04.697 --> 33:06.217
Ready, Kore?!

33:07.537 --> 33:10.576
Three, two, one...

33:10.577 --> 33:11.937
Go!

33:16.417 --> 33:17.817
Oh, my God!

33:18.063 --> 33:19.318
You're okay?

33:20.057 --> 33:21.696
The fall itself was fine.

33:21.697 --> 33:23.936
Landing was a little bit rough.

33:23.937 --> 33:25.256
That looked like
it hurt a little bit.

33:25.257 --> 33:26.816
It was a little bit of a butt hit.

33:26.817 --> 33:28.497
I think I got a little lopsided.

33:30.457 --> 33:32.816
Hello there, darling.
-Hello.

33:32.817 --> 33:35.736
They gave the ugly safety instructor
the day off, I guess.

33:35.737 --> 33:37.496
Exhale. Come up into your chest.

33:37.497 --> 33:39.616
My butt has never hurt that much.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.216
Route Info,
"Make your way to the next Pit Stop

33:42.217 --> 33:44.656
"at Bajra Sandhi Monument in Bali."

33:44.657 --> 33:47.736
Indonesia was once governed
by the Netherlands,

33:47.737 --> 33:50.816
before it declared independence
in 1945,

33:50.817 --> 33:53.696
<i>which is acknowledged here,
at the Bajra Sandhi Monument.</i>

33:53.697 --> 33:57.936
The last team to check in with me
at the mat may face elimination.

33:57.937 --> 33:59.496
Bali beach! Bali beach!

33:59.497 --> 34:01.057
Hey, great job today!

34:03.417 --> 34:04.616
No, that was so cool.

34:04.617 --> 34:06.896
That hot guy, he like, laid me down,
he was like,

34:06.897 --> 34:07.976
"We need to do some stretches."

34:07.977 --> 34:09.536
Did he stretch you out?

34:09.536 --> 34:11.766
He stretched me OUT!

34:14.976 --> 34:16.936
Roadblock, Brodie's doing it.

34:16.937 --> 34:18.766
Here we go. Come on, Brodes.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.136
We're still in this. Let's go.

34:20.137 --> 34:21.496
Dang!

34:21.496 --> 34:23.697
We've just got to hope and pray
something crazy happens.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.496
Oh, man.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.815
Feet first, not your tush.

34:28.817 --> 34:29.817
Oh, my gosh.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.056
Here she goes.

34:33.617 --> 34:35.137
Good Lord, that is high.

34:36.496 --> 34:39.056
(YELPS)
-There she goes!

34:42.697 --> 34:43.697
Oh, she nailed it!

34:43.697 --> 34:45.206
Oops,
she went a little bit sideways,

34:45.206 --> 34:46.206
but not too bad.

34:48.617 --> 34:50.136
Great job, babe!

34:50.137 --> 34:51.137
(SCREAMS)

34:51.138 --> 34:52.856
You killed it.
-Yes!

34:52.857 --> 34:55.206
Thanks for keeping her safe, guys.

34:55.206 --> 34:56.896
OK.
"Make your way to the Pit Stop..."

34:56.897 --> 34:58.767
Yes!
-Bajra Sandhi Monument, please!

35:00.417 --> 35:02.096
Cole might do this challenge

35:02.097 --> 35:04.496
and he might stand at the top
of that cliff four hours,

35:04.497 --> 35:05.576
working up the courage to jump,

35:05.577 --> 35:07.016
'cause he's deathly afraid
of heights.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.656
It looks like we're solidly
in second place.

35:09.657 --> 35:10.766
Final four.

35:10.767 --> 35:13.496
If this plan falls apart
because Cole won't jump,

35:13.497 --> 35:14.577
we'll kill him.

35:17.247 --> 35:19.376
I am so terrified of heights!

35:19.377 --> 35:21.896
On the mountainside,
I was hyperventilating.

35:21.897 --> 35:24.016
I was, like, pretty much crying.

35:24.017 --> 35:26.376
You're doing a good job.

35:26.377 --> 35:27.656
It's OK.

35:27.657 --> 35:29.856
(SOBS)

35:29.857 --> 35:32.056
It's only 40 feet.
-Yeah.

35:32.057 --> 35:33.856
But I know I'm saying only 40 feet,

35:33.857 --> 35:35.936
that's going to be crazy high
when I get up there.

35:35.937 --> 35:37.056
It's going to look high.

35:37.057 --> 35:39.726
But, Cole, don't think about it,
just do it.

35:39.727 --> 35:42.296
Alright. Bye, baby. Have fun!

35:42.297 --> 35:43.576
He needs to jump.

35:43.577 --> 35:46.576
I'm a little bit nervous
that he'll have second thoughts.

35:46.950 --> 35:48.480
Are you kidding me?!

35:49.445 --> 35:50.804
Wow, this is cool.

35:50.995 --> 35:53.314
The Dancers just showed up
behind us.

35:53.491 --> 35:54.530
We've got to get going.

35:54.531 --> 35:56.451
Oh, my gosh.

35:56.552 --> 35:57.984
I don't wanna look.

35:58.771 --> 36:01.250
You've got this, babe, have fun.

36:01.251 --> 36:02.450
Whoo!

36:02.451 --> 36:04.811
Come on, Cole!

36:06.411 --> 36:08.290
Right foot down to the ground.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.560
Yeah, this is awesome.

36:10.561 --> 36:12.371
It's a high jump, a little scary.

36:15.971 --> 36:17.810
Is that them?

36:17.811 --> 36:19.810
Yeah, that's them.
-Yes!

36:19.811 --> 36:22.130
I think that's Burnie
and Ashley's boat there.

36:22.131 --> 36:24.450
They are hungry for a first place.

36:24.451 --> 36:26.560
They've had four number twos
in a row.

36:26.561 --> 36:28.370
Let's make it five.

36:28.371 --> 36:29.650
This could be our day.

36:29.651 --> 36:31.171
This could be it. This could be it.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.490
I have like a split second
when I'm panicking but you know,

36:35.491 --> 36:38.011
I know that there's teams behind us.

36:40.811 --> 36:42.770
I've got to do this.

36:42.771 --> 36:44.411
Cole's got to jump.

36:46.651 --> 36:48.811
You can do it, Cole!

36:54.211 --> 36:55.371
He did it.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.370
Cole did it!

37:01.371 --> 37:03.010
The fall was...

37:03.011 --> 37:04.011
It was scary.

37:04.011 --> 37:05.011
It was just a freefall.

37:05.012 --> 37:07.330
I'm pretty sure
the water shot up my butt.

37:07.331 --> 37:08.560
(LAUGHS)

37:08.561 --> 37:09.650
I'm positive.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.330
The water came out, it was just...

37:11.331 --> 37:13.970
"Warning, the last team to check in
may be eliminated." OK.

37:13.971 --> 37:15.560
Let's go.
-Let's go.

37:15.561 --> 37:17.531
Whoo!

37:21.731 --> 37:23.651
You got it, babe!

37:25.171 --> 37:26.601
Whoo!

37:28.971 --> 37:30.890
Hey!

37:30.891 --> 37:32.531
Whoo!

37:33.651 --> 37:36.290
MATT: Now, I fell into the water
on my butt so hard,

37:36.291 --> 37:38.690
it felt like... almost like
hitting asphalt.

37:38.691 --> 37:41.930
As soon as I landed in the water
the guy was like, "Are you OK?"

37:41.931 --> 37:43.690
I was like, "Good enough."

37:43.691 --> 37:44.930
Whoo!

37:44.931 --> 37:46.211
Going to the Pit Stop.

37:48.251 --> 37:49.890
Go, go, go!

37:49.891 --> 37:51.650
Let's go.
-Let's race.

37:51.651 --> 37:52.850
Run down the beach.

37:52.851 --> 37:54.080
They're going that way.

37:54.081 --> 37:55.490
It's this way, you know that?

37:55.491 --> 37:56.970
Yeah.
-Yes.

37:56.971 --> 37:58.490
Back to the car. Get in.

37:58.491 --> 37:59.690
Taxi!

37:59.691 --> 38:00.970
This is your friend?
-No.

38:00.971 --> 38:02.130
Not our friend today.

38:02.131 --> 38:03.970
We don't see Burnie
and Ashley's cab.

38:03.971 --> 38:06.051
We saw them jump into a cab
right around when we did.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.490
BRODIE: I've actually done
a lot of cliff jumping before.

38:09.491 --> 38:11.081
Here we go, Brodie!

38:18.731 --> 38:19.891
Yeah!

38:20.971 --> 38:23.890
We just had to continue
to race hard. We can make up time.

38:23.891 --> 38:26.051
"Warning, the last team to check in
may be eliminated."

38:28.771 --> 38:29.810
This could be our first first.

38:29.811 --> 38:32.040
This could be their first first.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.490
Wouldn't want it to be
but we'll see.

38:34.491 --> 38:36.290
Hey, cement guy, let us squeeze by.

38:36.291 --> 38:37.291
Get out of the way, cement guy.

38:37.292 --> 38:38.490
Faster.

38:38.491 --> 38:39.530
Can we go any faster?

38:39.531 --> 38:40.810
There we go. Good job. Alright.

38:40.811 --> 38:41.811
Great.
-Whoo-hoo.

38:41.812 --> 38:43.770
We've got this.
We can take them on foot.

38:43.771 --> 38:45.770
I see the flag marked.

38:45.771 --> 38:47.080
Up the stairs.

38:47.081 --> 38:48.650
That's it!
-That's it.

38:48.651 --> 38:49.930
OK, we can still get them.

38:49.931 --> 38:51.771
Ty, come on!

38:53.491 --> 38:54.561
Let's go!

38:57.731 --> 39:00.010
(LAUGHS)

39:00.011 --> 39:01.331
Come on, Ty.

39:03.451 --> 39:04.810
PHIL: Nice work.

39:04.811 --> 39:06.081
Oh, God.

39:08.451 --> 39:10.770
Good job.

39:10.771 --> 39:13.210
Welcome to Bali, Indonesia.

39:13.211 --> 39:14.410
ALL: Thank you.

39:14.411 --> 39:17.530
Tyler and Korey, I'm pleased
to tell you you're team number one.

39:17.531 --> 39:18.531
Yeah!

39:18.532 --> 39:19.890
And I have some great news foe you,

39:19.891 --> 39:21.490
you have won a trip for two
from Travelocity

39:21.491 --> 39:24.080
and you are going on
an Alaskan cruise.

39:24.081 --> 39:25.730
(LAUGHTER)
That will do.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.850
<i>You're going to enjoy seven nights</i>

39:27.851 --> 39:30.730
<i>on Royal Caribbean's
Explorer of the Seas</i>

39:30.731 --> 39:34.560
<i>with excursions including
a kayak tour of Chilkoot Lake,</i>

39:34.561 --> 39:37.080
<i>Empress tea in British Columbia,</i>

39:37.081 --> 39:39.080
<i>and a culinary experience...</i>

39:39.081 --> 39:41.770
<i>Oh, and a tour of Glacier Gardens.</i>

39:41.771 --> 39:43.370
Burnie and Ashley, for you two,

39:43.371 --> 39:46.410
you are team number two.

39:46.411 --> 39:49.690
This is our fifth second place
in a row and it's tough.

39:49.691 --> 39:50.890
We could really use a win.

39:50.891 --> 39:53.600
You decided that you were going to
U-turn the Frisbee Boys.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.560
Yeah.
-It could be a good move.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.600
If anybody has a chance to win it,

39:57.601 --> 39:59.371
the Frisbee Boys
can't be in the finals.

40:01.171 --> 40:02.490
Go, go, go!

40:02.491 --> 40:03.560
Let's go, Mamma.

40:03.561 --> 40:04.970
I'm running as fast as I can.

40:04.971 --> 40:06.410
Taxi, taxi.

40:06.411 --> 40:08.170
Come on, fast. Fast, fast, fast.

40:08.171 --> 40:10.010
No.
-Wait, wait, wait.

40:10.011 --> 40:11.770
That's it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:11.771 --> 40:13.170
Go, go, go.

40:13.171 --> 40:15.010
You don't know? Do you know?
-Do you have a phone?

40:15.011 --> 40:17.010
Anchor aweigh.

40:17.011 --> 40:18.250
I'm saying nothing.

40:18.251 --> 40:19.970
Over here Brodie, come on.

40:19.971 --> 40:21.410
Cole, here, this guy.

40:21.411 --> 40:23.250
Come on, we've got to go!
-I know.

40:23.251 --> 40:25.410
The Dancers past us
as we were looking for a taxi.

40:25.411 --> 40:27.210
Brodie and Kurt, I just couldn't...

40:27.211 --> 40:29.690
After a certain point
couldn't worry about them.

40:29.691 --> 40:31.130
But you just never know.

40:31.131 --> 40:33.930
Teleportation, baby, teleportation.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.600
(CHEERING)

40:36.601 --> 40:37.890
Dancers.

40:37.891 --> 40:39.330
Hey!

40:39.331 --> 40:41.130
PHIL: Wow, what a recovery.

40:41.131 --> 40:42.131
Whoo!

40:42.132 --> 40:43.690
Congrats.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.930
Thank you.
-Thank you guys.

40:45.931 --> 40:48.080
Thank you, Ashley
and thank you for the U-Turn.

40:48.081 --> 40:49.331
Thank you for the U-Turn.

40:52.971 --> 40:55.040
Oh, my God, Sheri!

40:55.041 --> 40:57.370
Whoo!

40:57.371 --> 40:58.810
Welcome.

40:58.811 --> 41:01.730
Everybody standing here has
a one in four shot at $1 million.

41:01.731 --> 41:04.210
We don't even know,
who got to the U-Turn board third.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.600
The Frisbees.

41:05.601 --> 41:07.010
Oh.

41:07.011 --> 41:09.450
Let's get out of here
before the Frisbee Boys come.

41:09.451 --> 41:11.040
Tyler and I definitely want
to get out of here

41:11.041 --> 41:12.530
before the Frisbee guys show up.

41:12.531 --> 41:13.560
Heading into the eleventh leg,

41:13.561 --> 41:17.530
it really does feel like
it's anybody's finale to take.

41:17.531 --> 41:18.531
We see Phil, right there.

41:18.532 --> 41:20.290
He's all the way down the middle.

41:20.291 --> 41:21.651
Go, go, go.

41:26.491 --> 41:29.081
Brodie and Kurt,
you know the news is not good.

41:30.331 --> 41:31.410
Yeah, we figured.

41:31.411 --> 41:32.450
You are the last team to arrive

41:32.451 --> 41:34.931
and unfortunately, you have been
eliminated from the race.

41:36.531 --> 41:38.170
Pleasure, dude.
-Yeah. Thanks for it, bro.

41:38.171 --> 41:39.600
Hold your heads high.

41:39.601 --> 41:41.250
We ran as hard as we could.

41:41.251 --> 41:42.370
This leg was tough.

41:42.371 --> 41:43.770
We knew that we were
going to get U-turned

41:43.771 --> 41:46.560
but Burnie and Ashley definitely
threw us for a loop today.

41:46.561 --> 41:48.170
We definitely did not see
that coming.

41:48.171 --> 41:50.210
They made it
so we couldn't U-Turn anyone.

41:50.211 --> 41:52.730
Me and Kurt have lost
our fair share of games,

41:52.731 --> 41:54.450
this is a little harder though

41:54.451 --> 41:56.650
because we felt like
we didn't have control

41:56.651 --> 41:58.170
but we'll learn from it

41:58.171 --> 42:00.131
and hopefully become
better people from it.

42:01.851 --> 42:04.250
I'm probably going to hang out
in LA for a couple of days.

42:04.251 --> 42:05.251
Oh!

42:05.252 --> 42:07.600
And they're now be back in Dallas.
-Why are you doing that, Brodie?

42:07.601 --> 42:09.490
I mean, just to say hi
to some people.

42:09.491 --> 42:10.491
Who?

42:10.492 --> 42:12.850
Me and Blair have plans
on going on a date.

42:12.851 --> 42:15.171
I'm looking forward to it.
-Me too.
