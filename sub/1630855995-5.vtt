04:36.292 --> 04:37.792
- Thank you so much for having me.

04:37.792 --> 04:41.625
- Mabel, most of us who love coffee
have heard of the famous Italian blends,

04:41.625 --> 04:45.250
but you write in your book that
there's no such thing as Italian coffee.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.083
Can you explain?
- Of course.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.292
What I'm saying is there's no such thing

04:48.292 --> 04:50.958
as Italian coffee culture,
strictly speaking,

04:50.958 --> 04:53.083
because the beans are imported
from other countries.

04:53.083 --> 04:56.875
So Italy can't really claim ownership
of this culinary tradition

04:56.875 --> 04:59.083
without acknowledging the role
of these other countries.

04:59.083 --> 05:02.167
- In other words, coffee's a
shared tradition across cultures.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.167
- Absolutely.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.917
Some foods are born and bred
within one specific culture,

05:05.917 --> 05:08.292
but others come about
through commercial exchange,

05:08.292 --> 05:10.208
or a history of exploitation.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.083
I mean, the beans used in Italy

05:12.083 --> 05:15.875
are grown in countries
like Ethiopia and Brazil,

05:15.875 --> 05:17.625
and w-we can't ignore that fact

05:17.625 --> 05:19.917
when we talk
about "Italian coffee culture."

05:19.917 --> 05:23.708
- Yeah, but your book focuses on recipes
born and bred within one culture.

05:23.708 --> 05:24.708
MABEL MARTIN:
That's right.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.958
The diaspora of food,
just like the diaspora of people,

05:26.958 --> 05:29.417

05:29.417 --> 05:30.708
But personally,

South American, and Asian countries

when, well,
you yourself are a white woman?

- Well, like most people,
I am the product of multiple cultures.

05:52.250 --> 05:55.458
Yes, I was born in London,
but I have roots in Wales and Italy.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.583
And my grandmother
spent many years in Trinidad

05:57.583 --> 05:59.250

05:59.250 --> 06:01.333
She brought back loads of local recipes,

06:01.333 --> 06:04.125
which eventually inspired
my lifelong study of food.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.750
- So basically, your white ancestors
went to the Caribbean

06:07.750 --> 06:09.417
to convert people to their religion,

06:09.417 --> 06:12.292
and that makes you
an expert on those recipes?

06:12.292 --> 06:13.708
Right. Oh. I've got it.

06:13.708 --> 06:17.750
- No, what I'm saying is that most recipes
can't be claimed by one culture.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.417
Take, for instance, Caribbean rum cake.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.625
Cane sugar is the primary ingredient,

06:22.625 --> 06:25.250
which came from Asia originally,
not the Caribbean.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.500
So whose cake is it exactly?

06:27.500 --> 06:31.292
- If it's a recipe made in the Caribbean,
by Caribbean people,

06:31.292 --> 06:32.458
I would say it's Caribbean,

06:32.458 --> 06:34.833
regardless of where
one ingredient is from.

06:34.833 --> 06:38.125
- Rum originates in the Caribbean.
There's no history of rum cake in Asia.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.208
So I don't see how
it can be considered a shared tradition.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.667
- Well, I'm talking about
the recipe as a whole.

06:43.250 --> 06:46.667
I just don't think we can always say
where one culture ends and another begins,

06:46.667 --> 06:48.042
especially in the kitchen.

06:48.042 --> 06:51.083
- You can't say, since you're
not a member of those cultures.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.333
But I think you should be making space
for indigenous people

06:53.333 --> 06:56.667
