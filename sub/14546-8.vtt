00:01.259 --> 00:03.363
Ryan Shay hadn't taken the news well.

00:03.394 --> 00:04.606
Since learning about his adoption,

00:04.614 --> 00:07.258
he moved to Lisa's
ex-boyfriend Malik's house.

00:07.297 --> 00:08.947
There was nothing left to do but pray.

00:08.994 --> 00:10.519
Ok Lord.

00:11.105 --> 00:12.802
Let's try this again.

00:13.538 --> 00:16.213
We are thankful for the
food we are about to receive.

00:16.197 --> 00:18.348
- Very thankful.
- But we need more Lord.

00:19.646 --> 00:22.673
We need Ryan to forgive us for
Keeping his adoption secret.

00:23.564 --> 00:26.231
We need him to forgive
us, and to come home.

00:28.264 --> 00:29.171
And until then,

00:29.164 --> 00:33.481
if you ** to send us something other than
venison it would be very much appreciated.

00:34.318 --> 00:36.109
It's pretty heavy Lord.

00:36.229 --> 00:39.081
Every night, venison. Every night
until he comes home. Do you hear me?

00:39.112 --> 00:41.560
- No complaints here. His favorite is my favorite.
- I have gout.

00:41.747 --> 00:43.851
Even with the medication they're
saying I could lose a toe.

00:43.859 --> 00:46.807
- A toe?! I lost a son!
- Settle down Sheila. Settle down.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.529
Settle down. Here's your **.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.934
- What...
- It is a soothing combination

00:54.926 --> 00:57.257
of camomile, lemon balm and green alcohol.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.899
- Little more, ok?
- Sure thing.

00:59.336 --> 01:01.370
A little more Fred.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.154
She... Sheila.

01:04.748 --> 01:07.837
I don't know why I'm so
nervous. I aced the S.A.Ts.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.988
750 verbal.

01:10.285 --> 01:12.397
Dalia's real gifted
when it comes to testing.

01:12.413 --> 01:15.166
I never sweated 'cause our
girls are always out the charts.

01:15.221 --> 01:18.263
Did you know when she
was born, she was in a 95%

01:18.383 --> 01:19.553
for length.

01:20.562 --> 01:23.542
Waouh. Length. That is
the hardest one to nail.

01:25.254 --> 01:26.396
Ah ah!

01:26.435 --> 01:29.657
Is that a I'm-glad-it's-over smile, or an
I'm-glad-it's-over-and-I-nailed-it smile?

01:29.877 --> 01:31.425
- I feel pretty good about it.
- Yes you do!

01:31.417 --> 01:33.443
Give it! Come here. That's my girl.

01:33.443 --> 01:35.038
Mommy did you get my text?

01:35.039 --> 01:37.307
- Yes, did you see my reply?
-  Wait... you... you...

01:37.620 --> 01:40.333
- you texted her during the test?
- It's ok daddy Altman.

01:40.388 --> 01:43.031
I called her ***, so I was bored.

01:43.086 --> 01:45.261
- You finished early?
- I have a strategy.

01:45.237 --> 01:47.959
- What strategy?
- Finishing early.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.250
Tessa, let's celebrate. Ice cream.

01:50.243 --> 01:53.465
Any cart in the store, you pick,
we'll make cones at home. You want to?

01:53.496 --> 01:55.852
Mommy, what are we
gonna do to celebrate me?

01:55.887 --> 01:58.889
Um, how about we put a
new S.A.T. sound system

01:58.923 --> 02:01.091
in your new P.S.A.T. car?

02:01.125 --> 02:02.626
She got a P.S.A.T. car?

02:02.660 --> 02:03.727
She's kidding.

02:03.761 --> 02:05.395
I'm not kidding. You're not kidding?

02:05.429 --> 02:07.164
How well might Dalia
have done on the P.S.A.Ts

02:07.198 --> 02:08.565
to warrant a brand-new car?

02:08.598 --> 02:10.066
Real well. How well?

02:10.101 --> 02:13.003
Like top 10 percentile? Top 20?

02:13.037 --> 02:16.806
<i>I'm proud to say Dalia was
definitely in a percentile.</i>

02:16.841 --> 02:18.308
The average S.I. score is 141.

02:18.342 --> 02:19.910
Did Dalia do better or worse than average?

02:19.944 --> 02:21.945
Tessa, maybe you should
just focus on your own score.

02:21.979 --> 02:23.413
On the P.S.A.Ts? 186.

02:23.447 --> 02:24.581
That's in the top ten percentile,

02:24.615 --> 02:26.683
and that's very good.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.048
(Clicks tongue) I got a card.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.683
Mommy, I want to go home.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.252
What about the sound system?

02:32.286 --> 02:35.255
I'm not in the mood for sound anymore.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.425
<i>That look meant someone was
gonna be making an apology,</i>

02:38.459 --> 02:41.795
<i>and that someone was me.</i>

Howdy.

02:56.055 --> 02:58.157

desperate to get Ryan back.</i>

02:58.191 --> 02:59.725
You talking to me?

02:59.759 --> 03:03.629
I don't see anybody
else around here, cowboy.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.631
Really? Because you hung up on me

03:05.665 --> 03:07.866
every time I tried to
call you since our breakup.

03:07.901 --> 03:11.036
And a woman's allowed to
change her mind, isn't she?

03:11.070 --> 03:13.372
Because I have.

03:13.406 --> 03:15.507
In fact, that's why I'm here.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.876
I wanted to talk about
us getting back together.

03:17.911 --> 03:19.411
- Really?
- Really.

03:19.446 --> 03:22.114
(Deepened voice) Don't fight. Keep that on.

03:22.148 --> 03:23.582
Hold his hand. I got it.

03:23.616 --> 03:25.417
(Tape crackling)

03:25.452 --> 03:28.987
Get in! Come on!

03:29.022 --> 03:30.355
Oh!

03:38.598 --> 03:42.000
Wait!

03:42.035 --> 03:43.969
<i>Meanwhile, the Werners'

03:44.003 --> 03:45.671
<i>from his first-picked preschool,</i>

03:45.705 --> 03:48.407
<i>so they decided to consult a specialist.</i>

03:48.441 --> 03:51.310
We heard you're the best,
that you've helped others.

03:51.344 --> 03:54.313
It's true. I tutor talented toddlers,

03:54.347 --> 03:56.348
and every one of them
goes on to be accepted

03:56.382 --> 03:58.917
into a highly competitive day care program.

03:58.952 --> 04:00.752
- So you'll help us?
- I've gotta be frank with you.

04:00.787 --> 04:02.855
Opus is getting a late start.

04:02.889 --> 04:06.191
He has zero community service,
no political affiliations,

04:06.226 --> 04:08.093
he's socially unaware.

04:08.127 --> 04:11.096
He doesn't even wear
special cause bracelets.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.865
Oh, that's our fault.
We were led to believe

04:12.899 --> 04:14.867
that the special cause
bracelet trend was over.

04:14.901 --> 04:16.902
<i>It's never over.</i>

04:16.935 --> 04:19.671
Don't punish the boy for his parents' sins.

04:19.706 --> 04:20.939
You're his only hope.

04:20.974 --> 04:22.808
Well, then he's hopeless, I'm afraid.

04:22.842 --> 04:25.811
You see, I'm not taking on
any new clients at this time.

04:25.845 --> 04:27.179
You don't get it. (Inhales deeply)

04:27.213 --> 04:29.181
Jill, show him. There's
a picture. Show him.

04:29.215 --> 04:31.683
That won't be necessary.
I'm sure that he's as...

04:31.718 --> 04:33.218
(Gasps)

04:33.253 --> 04:35.354
Oh, the face.

04:35.388 --> 04:38.624
Look at that little face-y face face.

04:38.658 --> 04:39.992
(Sighs)

04:40.026 --> 04:41.460
Okay.

04:41.494 --> 04:42.728
I will do it...

04:42.762 --> 04:43.829
Oh!

04:43.863 --> 04:45.564
On one condition...

04:45.598 --> 04:47.900
you must not interfere in any way.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.801
My methods will seem unconventional

04:49.836 --> 04:52.170
<i>because they are unconventional.</i>

04:52.205 --> 04:54.840
I need you to understand
that the odds are 100 to 1.

04:54.874 --> 04:58.644
A single misstep and instead
of going to Price-Cheney-Pitkin,

04:58.678 --> 05:00.812
Opus could end up working the pole

05:00.847 --> 05:02.681
on "Toddlers & Tiaras."

05:05.351 --> 05:08.153
We'll take those odds, any day.

05:11.057 --> 05:12.724
Hello? Is anyone there?

05:12.759 --> 05:15.127
Look, I might have to use the bathroom.

05:15.161 --> 05:16.962
Sooner rather than later,

05:16.996 --> 05:18.964
(deepened voice) We're going to
give you an afterschool snack,

05:18.998 --> 05:22.134
but don't try to run away
and don't take our masks off.

05:22.168 --> 05:23.735
(Deepened voice) We own you, bitch.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.471
Okay. Okay. I won't give you
any trouble. I understand.

05:28.169 --> 05:30.771
(Deepened voice) Here. Eat this.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.576
(Crunches)

05:35.610 --> 05:37.711
(Mouth full) Mmm. So good.

05:37.745 --> 05:39.813
I can tell Mrs. Shay's
chicken salad anywhere.

05:39.847 --> 05:41.415
(Giggles, normal voice) Oh, thanks, Malik.

05:41.449 --> 05:43.584
I added some ranch for zip.

05:43.618 --> 05:45.118
(Normal voice) Darn it, Sheila!

05:45.153 --> 05:47.354
Thanks to your signature chicken
salad, he knows who we are.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.890
Plus Lisa wasn't wearing a mask
when she lured me into the van.

05:49.924 --> 05:52.459
You know, that's pretty cold,
Lisa, pretending you want

05:52.493 --> 05:53.927
- to get back together just so you could...
- We need you to call your parents.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.896
You tell them that we
are holding you hostage

05:55.930 --> 05:57.331
and we will exchange you for our son Ryan.

05:57.365 --> 05:59.666
If they need proof of life, we
will happily cut off a digit.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.068
Tell them no tricks, or
we won't give you back.

06:01.102 --> 06:04.004
And try to sound terrified.

06:04.038 --> 06:06.440
H... hi, dad. Yeah, I'm at the Shays'.

06:06.474 --> 06:08.275
Uh, h... hold on.

06:08.309 --> 06:09.876
They want to know if
I'm staying for dinner.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.446
Come on! This is a hostage situation, son!

06:12.480 --> 06:15.849
I... think they want me
to stay for dinner, yes.

06:15.883 --> 06:18.385
Okay. Hold on. My dad wants to talk to you.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.653
Eh. Tell... tell him I stepped out.

06:19.687 --> 06:21.321
- (Whispers) Take the call, Fred.
- Take the call!

06:21.356 --> 06:23.490
Okay.

06:23.524 --> 06:25.525
(Clears throat)

06:26.840 --> 06:29.108
Fred Shay speaking.

06:29.142 --> 06:30.276
Uh-huh.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.343
Tonight?

06:31.378 --> 06:32.645
I see.

06:32.679 --> 06:34.580
Well, you should know I won't be alone.

06:34.614 --> 06:35.514
(Whispers) That's good.
That's good. That's good.

06:35.549 --> 06:37.616
Then we understand each other.

06:37.651 --> 06:39.084
Very well.

06:39.119 --> 06:40.519
Bye then.

06:40.554 --> 06:42.054
Hmm. Great guy.

06:42.088 --> 06:43.489
What did he say? Will he give us back Ryan?

06:43.523 --> 06:44.790
They want us to come to them.

06:44.824 --> 06:46.859
- Mnh-mnh. Smells like a trap.
- We should leave Malik home

06:46.893 --> 06:48.127
and use him as a bargaining chip.

06:48.161 --> 06:49.862
No, his instructions were very clear.

06:49.896 --> 06:52.698
We're to drop off Malik tonight
for the hostage exchange.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.967
Well, technically, he said dinner.

06:55.001 --> 06:56.101
Thai food.

06:56.136 --> 06:57.636
Oh.

07:00.781 --> 07:02.882
Dalia, Tessa's here.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.851
I don't want to see Tessa Altman.

07:04.885 --> 07:07.553
She made me feel bad about my P.S.A.T. car.

07:07.753 --> 07:11.689
I know. And maybe Tessa
was a teeny, tiny bit smug,

07:11.723 --> 07:13.958
which is so unusual for her.

07:13.992 --> 07:16.494
But I think that's why
she's here... to apologize.

07:16.528 --> 07:18.195
Apology not accepted.

07:18.410 --> 07:19.977
Listen here, Dalia.

07:20.571 --> 07:22.572
Tessa may score better on
tests and get better grades

07:22.607 --> 07:25.308
and have opportunities to get
into colleges based on merit,

07:25.343 --> 07:28.011
but there are lots of
things you're great at, too.

07:28.046 --> 07:29.146
Like what, mommy?

07:29.180 --> 07:31.815
Well, tons and tons of stuff.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.619
Name one thing, mommy.

07:35.653 --> 07:37.888
Name one thing I'm better
at than Tessa Altman.

07:40.122 --> 07:41.256
Well...

07:42.625 --> 07:43.859
(Gasps)

07:43.893 --> 07:48.263
I'm sure Tessa Altman is not as
dope as you on the dance floor.

07:50.533 --> 07:51.699
Send her in.

07:51.734 --> 07:53.902
Altmans!

07:53.936 --> 07:55.470
(George) Yeah?

07:57.704 --> 08:01.641
<i>Right. So I just wanted to apologize</i>

08:01.675 --> 08:04.677
for repeatedly asking you about your score,

08:05.011 --> 08:06.679
and I'm sure

08:06.713 --> 08:08.848
whatever your score was,

08:08.882 --> 08:13.819
it completely merited a
new, extremely expensive car.

08:13.854 --> 08:14.887
Wasn't that nice, Dalia?

08:15.761 --> 08:18.196
Tessa apologized by making an apology.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.298
Yeah.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.933
And I know it's important

08:21.968 --> 08:23.802
to mommy and daddy
Altman that we get along,

08:23.836 --> 08:25.170
so I'd like you to invite you

08:25.204 --> 08:26.538
to a hip-hop dance class I'm taking.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.707
(Inhales deeply) No, thanks.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.342
Oh. Oh. Tessa.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.643
- Tessa.
- What?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.211
Dalia is trying.

08:33.245 --> 08:34.913
(Whispers) Are you serious?

08:34.947 --> 08:36.308
Look, I'm trying, Dallas is trying,

08:36.315 --> 08:37.816
and now even Dalia is trying.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.551
That only leaves one
person who is not trying,

08:39.585 --> 08:41.304
and I believe you know
who I'm referring to.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.422
I do. The girl who scored
in the top ten percentile

08:44.457 --> 08:46.758
and got a card.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.227
With a "D" at the end of it.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.796
<i>Card.</i>

08:59.289 --> 09:00.256
Huh. Brick.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.925
I did not expect that.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.627
Okay, before anyone rings the bell,

09:04.661 --> 09:07.129
- we need to go over a few scenarios.
- Scenarios? What scenarios?

09:07.163 --> 09:08.397
Is this something we should've
talked about in the car

09:08.431 --> 09:10.232
- instead of playing "I spy"?
- Okay, let's just say

09:10.267 --> 09:11.834
there're gonna be a lot of
moving parts here tonight.

09:11.868 --> 09:13.769
We need to keep our cool if we
want to bring home the bacon.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.870
Mm.

09:14.905 --> 09:16.272
(Doorbell rings)

09:16.306 --> 09:18.741
(Door creaks)

09:19.035 --> 09:20.269
Did you do your homework?

09:20.303 --> 09:22.371
Not yet. I was kidnapped.

09:22.405 --> 09:24.206
- Get in here.
- Yes, dad.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.941
Hi. Please come in.

09:25.975 --> 09:28.010
Eugene has told us so much about you.

09:28.044 --> 09:29.545
Have we got the wrong house?

09:29.579 --> 09:31.880
Your son Ryan changed his name to Eugene.

09:31.915 --> 09:34.716
He doesn't want to be
known as a Shay anymore.

09:34.751 --> 09:36.185
I'm going down.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.020
(Thud) Sheila?

09:38.054 --> 09:39.721
Welcome back, Sheila.

09:39.756 --> 09:41.023
(Moans)

09:41.257 --> 09:42.791
- You feeling better?
- Oh.

09:42.825 --> 09:44.659
You gave us a quite a scare. She did.

09:44.694 --> 09:46.628
Would you like some water?

09:46.662 --> 09:48.830
Ryan. Hand over Ryan,

09:48.865 --> 09:50.365
in whatever condition he's in...

09:50.400 --> 09:53.001
Battered, broken, brainwashed!

09:53.036 --> 09:55.604
Eugene is otherwise occupied right now.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.305
He'll be down in due time.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.707
We're willing to pay.

09:58.741 --> 10:00.075
Fred has $15,000 in cash
taped to his stomach.

10:01.029 --> 10:04.632
(Ryan) I don't care if he
has 15 jillion jillions!

10:04.666 --> 10:06.233
There's no way I'm going home

10:06.268 --> 10:08.536
with a fake bunch of faking fakers!

10:08.570 --> 10:10.204
Ryan, it's us,

10:10.238 --> 10:13.407
your parents. We love you and we miss you.

10:13.442 --> 10:14.976
Lisa wore a dress.

10:16.678 --> 10:19.213
My name's Eugene now.

10:19.247 --> 10:20.848
Eugene Goldfarb.

10:20.882 --> 10:22.750
I'm no longer a Shay.

10:22.784 --> 10:24.385
I'm getting emancipated.

10:24.419 --> 10:26.587
Oh, you don't happen to have a crash mat?

10:26.621 --> 10:28.356
- Mnh-mnh.
- Emancipation?

10:28.390 --> 10:29.857
He can't just make that kind
of proclamation, can he, Fred?

10:29.891 --> 10:31.125
I don't know.

10:31.684 --> 10:33.785
Eugene wants to be an
emancipated minor, Sheila.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.255
He feels very strongly about
it, and since I'm a lawyer,

10:36.289 --> 10:37.523
I started to help him with the paperwork.

10:37.557 --> 10:39.658
Lawyers, Fred. Lawyers.
Lawyers. They're lawyers.

10:39.692 --> 10:42.194
This is one of those
scenarios I was referring to.

10:42.228 --> 10:43.762
You realize if the judge
rules in your son's favor,

10:43.796 --> 10:46.198
you'll both have to surrender
your parental rights?

10:46.232 --> 10:47.666
Surrender? Sheila?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.568
- No.
- I'm suing you for freedom.

10:49.602 --> 10:51.970
You hear me? I am suing you to be free!

10:53.273 --> 10:54.506
Well, should we eat?

10:55.842 --> 10:57.976
- Yeah. Might as well.
- Sure. Yeah. Sounds good.

10:59.011 --> 11:00.378
Okay, Opus.

11:00.412 --> 11:02.480
I don't want you to feel
like I'm judging you,

11:02.514 --> 11:03.915
but for the next 45 minutes,

11:03.949 --> 11:06.250
I'm going to be judging you harshly.

11:06.285 --> 11:07.585
Grab and release.

11:07.619 --> 11:08.653
Grab...

11:08.687 --> 11:10.655

11:10.689 --> 11:11.756

- Mm-hmm.

17:39.469 --> 17:41.570
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I...

17:41.605 --> 17:42.738
I think I got carried away.

17:42.772 --> 17:44.540
I shouldn't have gangsta'd you.

17:44.574 --> 17:45.975
That's a... an aggressive move

17:46.009 --> 17:48.644
best reserved for an
"electric boogaloo" reboot.

17:48.678 --> 17:50.145
I apologize, too, George.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.547
I am one of the unlucky few

17:51.581 --> 17:54.316
whose ugly side comes
out on the dance floor.

17:54.351 --> 17:57.353
No. No, it's true. I get real mouthy.

17:57.387 --> 17:59.722
You do. (Laughs)

17:59.756 --> 18:01.557
You know what? Our girls are gonna fight.

18:01.591 --> 18:03.492
That doesn't mean we have to.

18:03.526 --> 18:06.195
I know you probably don't agree
with everything I do with Dalia,

18:06.229 --> 18:08.530
and I wouldn't let Tessa
wear half the clothes

18:08.565 --> 18:11.133
you allow her to run around town in,

18:11.167 --> 18:13.102
but I know you're a good dad.

18:13.136 --> 18:18.040
And no one has a bigger
heart than you, Dallas,

18:18.074 --> 18:20.943
even if your robot needs a little oil.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.479
Oh, yeah? You gonna oil my robot, daddy?

18:23.513 --> 18:25.648
Not in front of the kids.

18:25.682 --> 18:29.451
I'm sorry, but there's
no easy way to say this.

18:29.486 --> 18:32.221
Opus has the brain development
of a 6-month-old child.

18:32.255 --> 18:33.989
(Sighs)

18:34.024 --> 18:36.058
Are you absolutely sure?

18:36.092 --> 18:37.226
I'm afraid so.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.662
- Price-Cheney-Pitkin?
- Is out, of course.

18:39.696 --> 18:41.830
I could suggest a facility
that could house the boy...

18:41.865 --> 18:43.165
someplace with experience

18:43.199 --> 18:46.235
dealing with the special needs
of the blindingly average.

18:46.269 --> 18:48.771
No. We couldn't do that.

18:48.805 --> 18:50.339
I'm not sure how we'll tell him.

18:50.373 --> 18:52.574
Sadly, I doubt he'll even understand.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.777
I don't care that he's not a genius.

18:54.811 --> 18:58.914
He's a beautiful boy, and we love him.

18:58.949 --> 19:02.584
Oh.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.954
Do you see that? (Coos)

19:04.988 --> 19:06.322
He spelled out D-D-S.

19:06.356 --> 19:08.123
He understands that his father has

19:08.158 --> 19:10.192
a doctor of dental surgery degree,

19:10.226 --> 19:13.562
not a D.M.D., a mistake
that many people make.

19:13.596 --> 19:15.664
He probably just grabbed
the blocks at random.

19:15.699 --> 19:18.067
- You're random!
- Oh, lashing out.

19:18.101 --> 19:19.468
Opus? (Fusses)

19:19.502 --> 19:21.603
Can you spell out mommy's career?

19:21.638 --> 19:23.072
Author.

19:23.106 --> 19:24.206
Find an "A."

19:24.240 --> 19:26.342
That's right. Yes, right there.

19:26.376 --> 19:29.712
Or an "S." Self-published author.

19:34.484 --> 19:36.418
Oh. (Stomach rumbles)

19:36.453 --> 19:37.920
Did you eat enough dinner?

19:37.954 --> 19:39.755
I don't love vegetables.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.724
Seemed like you didn't really
love dessert tonight, either.

19:41.758 --> 19:44.827
Yeah. Usually my favorite
part about dinner is dessert,

19:44.861 --> 19:46.295
and my favorite dessert is pudding,

19:46.329 --> 19:47.997
and my favorite pudding
flavor is chocolate,

19:48.031 --> 19:51.333
but my absolute favorite part
of chocolate pudding is the skin,

19:51.368 --> 19:53.002
and tonight's pudding was skinless.

19:53.036 --> 19:55.671
But don't tell our mom. I
don't want to hurt her feelings.

19:55.705 --> 19:57.439
It won't.

19:57.474 --> 19:59.975
(Sighs)

20:00.010 --> 20:01.643
I love pudding skin so much,

20:01.678 --> 20:04.713
my old mom used to make
it for me all the time.

20:04.748 --> 20:08.150
My old father and sister would
usually give me their skin, too.

20:08.184 --> 20:10.085
Because they love you.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.653
Yeah.

20:13.323 --> 20:14.590
I'll just ask my new black mom

20:14.624 --> 20:16.425
to make pudding with
skin on it from now on.

20:16.459 --> 20:17.993
Yeah, see, that's not gonna happen.

20:18.028 --> 20:20.929
My parents make what they like,
and they like skinless pudding.

20:20.964 --> 20:22.364
Huh.

20:30.507 --> 20:31.707
(Crash)

20:31.741 --> 20:33.675
Andie MacDowell, what are you doing here?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.711
Fred, wake up. Did you hear that?

20:35.745 --> 20:37.346
I did.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.784
Do you think...

20:46.723 --> 20:48.690
He's back.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.226
Our boy is back.

20:52.429 --> 20:54.863
Hey.

20:58.268 --> 21:00.369
Eugene's leaving. Where's he going?

21:01.738 --> 21:03.939
It's Ryan, you guys.

21:05.375 --> 21:08.477
I'm going to bed.

21:13.716 --> 21:16.085
Skin is thicker than water.

21:17.487 --> 21:20.789
I don't think that's the correct saying.

21:20.824 --> 21:22.724
No. No.

21:22.759 --> 21:23.992
(Whispers) Leave it alone.
He's standing on the stairs,

21:24.027 --> 21:25.828
- listening.
- (Whispers) If that's true,

21:25.862 --> 21:27.930
then the only thing I
want him to hear is this...

21:27.964 --> 21:30.399
I love you, son.

21:30.433 --> 21:32.534
(Whispers) If you're
listening, I love you, too.

21:32.569 --> 21:33.769
(Whispers) If you're listening,

21:33.803 --> 21:36.305
it's blood that's thicker than water.

21:36.339 --> 21:38.941
It's blood.
