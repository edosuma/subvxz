<i>  robots, activate.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:12.478
[crowd cheering]

00:20.454 --> 00:24.823
<i> welcome to battlebots,</i>
<i> the world leader</i>
<i> in robot fighting action.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:29.495
To our international viewers,
<i> hola, bonjour, and konnichiwa.</i>

00:29.497 --> 00:32.965
And to our robot viewers,
a hearty 01001101.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.033
[crowd laughs]

00:34.035 --> 00:35.768
I'm chris rose,
joined, as always,

00:35.770 --> 00:37.436
by fight analyst
and mma legend,

00:37.438 --> 00:39.405
say hello to kenny florian.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.939
[crowd cheering]

00:40.941 --> 00:42.074
[kenny] chris,
thank you so much,

00:42.076 --> 00:44.343
I didn't know you spoke robot,
that's so cool.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.078
Yeah, just a little.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.047
I remember from high school
and I'm pretty sure

00:48.049 --> 00:50.816
I just asked the pulverizer
where the library is.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.753
Anyway, over the years,
battlebots has truly become
a global phenomenon,

00:54.755 --> 00:57.122
and this year's tournament
is no exception.

00:57.124 --> 01:01.026
We've got combatants
from across eight countries
and five continents.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.027
That's right, chris.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.029
But there's one thing
in the battlebots world

01:04.031 --> 01:07.699
that's the same
in every language
and it's the giant nut.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.201
[crowd cheering]

01:10.271 --> 01:13.806
<i> [chris] let's take a look</i>
<i>  at the 14 teams</i>
<i>  hoping to kick start</i>

01:13.808 --> 01:15.908
<i>  their championship journey</i>
<i>  tonight</i>

01:15.910 --> 01:19.144
<i>  with that all important</i>
<i>  first win of the season,</i>

01:19.146 --> 01:22.181
<i>  and this group</i>
<i>  has some serious firepower.</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:28.720
<i>  We'll see the serrated</i>
<i> slasher cobalt make its return</i>
<i>  to the battle box.</i>

01:28.722 --> 01:33.058
<i>  2020's most destructive</i>
<i>  bot award winner, valkyrie,</i>

01:33.060 --> 01:37.863
<i> as well as perennial giant nut</i>
<i>  contender's witchdoctor,</i>

01:37.865 --> 01:41.600
<i>  and the unburnable</i>
<i>  brazilian's black dragon.</i>

01:41.602 --> 01:46.305
<i>  It's a who's who of</i>
<i>  the sport's heaviest hitters.</i>

01:46.307 --> 01:49.775
<i> [kenny] we've also got</i>
<i>  the return of</i>
<i>  some exciting veterans.</i>

01:49.777 --> 01:54.546
<i>  After taking last season off,</i>
<i>  hal rucker</i>
<i>  and the indestructible duck!</i>

01:54.548 --> 01:56.548
<i>  Will re-enter the battlebox.</i>

01:57.685 --> 02:00.752
<i>  And for the first time</i>
<i>  since 2018,</i>

02:00.754 --> 02:06.959
<i>  grab your earplugs, chris,</i>
<i>  the combustion king icewave</i>
<i>  is back in the field.</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:12.631
<i>  I'm telling ya,</i>
<i>  no one could say no to vegas.</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:15.968
<i> [chris] and, of course,</i>
<i>  all roads lead to</i>
<i>  tonight's main event</i>

02:15.970 --> 02:19.238
<i>  where we will see</i>
<i>  if the living legend</i>
<i>  donald hudson</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:22.808
<i> and lock-jaw have the antidote</i>
<i>  for the vicious bite</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:25.077
<i>  of last year's number three</i>
<i>  seed, copperhead.</i>

02:25.079 --> 02:27.446
[commentator]
<i>  this fight is over.</i>

02:27.448 --> 02:30.282
<i> [chris] but kicking off</i>
<i>  tonight's action,</i>
<i>  we've got a good one.</i>

02:30.284 --> 02:34.319
<i>  It's the tank that loves</i>
<i>  to toss, slammo!</i>

02:34.321 --> 02:38.123
<i>  Throwing down with the always</i>
<i>  electric, hypershock.</i>

02:38.125 --> 02:40.859
<i>  Kenny, hypershock</i>
<i>  led by will bales</i>

02:40.861 --> 02:44.730
<i>  is one of the most</i>
<i>  popular teams</i>
<i>  in the entire competition,</i>

02:44.732 --> 02:47.933
<i>  and while they've given us</i>
<i>  plenty of memorable moments</i>
<i>  over the years,</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:51.103
<i>  they've yet to put together</i>
<i>  a memorable season.</i>

02:51.105 --> 02:53.272
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  this is a team</i>
<i>  that went toe-to-toe</i>

02:53.274 --> 02:56.742
<i>  with bite force in 2015</i>
<i>  in the round of 16</i>

02:56.744 --> 02:59.945
<i>  and nearly pulled off</i>
<i>  a magical upset.</i>

02:59.947 --> 03:03.182
<i>  Hypershock has all the tools</i>
<i>  to become a top tier bot.</i>

03:03.184 --> 03:06.385
<i>  We'll see if this is the year</i>
<i>  they take the next step.</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:10.088
<i> [chris] and as for</i>
<i>  their opponent, slammo!,</i>

03:10.090 --> 03:12.925
<i>  they went two and one</i>
<i>  in the qualifiers last season</i>

03:12.927 --> 03:16.828
<i>  lost to eventual</i>
<i>  semi-finalist black dragon.</i>

03:16.830 --> 03:21.266
<i> This spot, led by craig danby,</i>
<i>  is looking to make the leap</i>
<i>  from middle of the pack</i>

03:21.268 --> 03:23.435
<i>  to legitimate contenders.</i>

03:23.437 --> 03:25.037
Kenny, you ready
to get this thing going?

03:25.039 --> 03:26.138
Let's do this.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.873
Are you guys ready as well?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.875
[crowd cheering]

03:29.877 --> 03:30.909
[chris] I thought so.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.245
Faruq, take it away.

03:34.615 --> 03:41.153
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's robot fighting time.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.155
[crowd cheering]

03:49.863 --> 03:55.934
[faruq] in the red square,
he came from miami,
and he's here to slam thee.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.104
It's hypershock!

04:06.747 --> 04:10.349
<i> [chris] here we go,</i>
<i>  team hypershock.</i>

04:10.351 --> 04:13.051
<i>  Will bales mask's</i>
<i>  all over the arena.</i>

04:13.053 --> 04:15.020
<i>  They love this guy.</i>

04:15.022 --> 04:19.958
<i>  Snuck into the tournament</i>
<i>  last season</i>
<i> as the number 32 overall seed.</i>

04:19.960 --> 04:23.095
<i>  Kenny, this spot</i>
<i>  isn't just pretty,</i>
<i>  it is lethal.</i>

04:23.097 --> 04:26.231
<i>  That's if everything</i>
<i>  is working properly.</i>

04:26.233 --> 04:27.132
[kenny]
<i>  and that's the biggest if.</i>

04:27.134 --> 04:29.268
<i>  But listen,</i>
<i>  will sounds confident.</i>

04:29.270 --> 04:34.673
<i>  He's got a complete squad,</i>
<i>  as you can see running</i>
<i>  the high five gantlet.</i>

04:34.675 --> 04:37.876
<i>  I'm expecting hypershock</i>
<i>  to stick and move,</i>
<i>  stick and move</i>

04:37.878 --> 04:41.079
<i>  and wreak some havoc</i>
<i>  with that dual disc</i>
<i>  vertical spin.</i>

04:41.081 --> 04:43.148
[crowd cheering]

04:45.653 --> 04:49.321
in the blue square,
from raleigh, north carolina,

04:49.323 --> 04:51.189
being in the ring
with this spot,

04:51.191 --> 04:53.892
it's all the slammunition
it needs.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.962
It's slammo!

04:56.964 --> 04:59.298
[crowd cheering]

05:07.074 --> 05:10.042
<i> [chris] captain craig danby</i>
<i>  draped in the union jack.</i>

05:10.044 --> 05:12.644
<i>  Kenny, slammo!</i>
<i>  Is built like a brick.</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:15.380
<i>  How does it win</i>
<i> this fight against hypershock?</i>

05:15.382 --> 05:17.816
<i> [kenny] well, slammo!</i>
<i>  Is a powerful grappler</i>

05:17.818 --> 05:20.052
<i>  that looks to control fights</i>
<i>  by grabbing, tossing,</i>

05:20.054 --> 05:22.154
<i>  and disorienting</i>
<i>  its opponents.</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:26.058
<i>  It needs to be durable enough</i>
<i>  to survive shock</i>
<i>  from hypershock.</i>

05:26.060 --> 05:28.994
<i>  Ideally, try and break</i>
<i>  will bales' weapon,</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:31.263
<i>  then look to sweep</i>
<i>  that control category.</i>

05:31.265 --> 05:33.432
[crowd cheering]

05:39.940 --> 05:43.241
<i>  we don't want to have</i>
<i>  a one and done, you know,</i>
<i>  one hit wonder fight.</i>

05:43.243 --> 05:45.977
<i>  We, we want to have a good</i>
<i>  back and forth with craig.</i>

05:45.979 --> 05:47.913
<i>  He has very low forks.</i>

05:47.915 --> 05:49.848
<i>  He has lots of little</i>
<i>  clickety-clackety things.</i>

05:49.850 --> 05:52.551
<i>  No doubt he's gonna try</i>
<i>  to get under us</i>
<i>  because it's his whole thing.</i>

05:52.553 --> 05:55.287
<i>  We have to do</i>
<i>  our darndest to make sure</i>
<i>  that doesn't happen.</i>

05:55.289 --> 05:57.622
<i>  So, we threw out</i>
<i>  all the old stuff</i>
<i>  that wasn't quite right,</i>

05:57.624 --> 06:00.759
<i>  and we beefed everything up,</i>
<i>  put bigger parts in,</i>
<i>  put better parts in,</i>

06:00.761 --> 06:04.129
<i>  and we think</i>
<i>  it's gonna be a heavy hitter.</i>
<i>  It's gonna be great.</i>

06:04.131 --> 06:08.233
<i>  We are a grabby lift bot</i>
<i>  and we have covered</i>
<i>  our robot this year</i>

06:08.235 --> 06:09.935
<i>  in anaglyph dazzle camo.</i>

06:09.937 --> 06:13.071
<i>  So, if you've got 3d glasses,</i>
<i>  it's gonna pop.</i>

06:13.073 --> 06:15.640
<i> There's this whole new feature</i>
<i>  this year</i>
<i>  called the upper deck.</i>

06:15.642 --> 06:19.378
<i>  The plan</i>
<i>  is to pick up hypershock</i>
<i>  and throw them on there.</i>

06:19.380 --> 06:22.214
<i>  And when they get back off,</i>
<i>  I'mma throw them</i>
<i>  back on there again.</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:23.382
<i>  I'm coming in for the win.</i>

06:23.384 --> 06:25.117
<i>  I'm always coming in</i>
<i>  for the win.</i>

06:25.119 --> 06:27.219
<i>  I'm the sultan of suplex.</i>

06:27.221 --> 06:28.987
<i>  That's what I'm here for.</i>

06:33.627 --> 06:35.961
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

06:42.803 --> 06:45.937
<i> [chris] kenny,</i>
<i>  look at these two getting</i>
<i>  into each other's squares,</i>

06:45.939 --> 06:49.374
<i>  a little bit of gamesmanship</i>
<i>  right off the bat.</i>

06:49.376 --> 06:51.476
<i> [kenny] oh,</i>
<i>  excited for this one, chris.</i>

06:54.047 --> 06:55.647
[automated voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

06:55.649 --> 06:58.617
All right. We're good.
Go for it.

06:58.619 --> 07:03.188
<i> [chris] I guess, that's why</i>
<i>  he's will bales</i>
<i>  and not just will "bail."</i>

07:05.092 --> 07:07.859
[automated voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

07:07.861 --> 07:09.194
[man] I'll hammer,
if it's over there.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.395
You got this.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.130

[crowd cheering]

07:32.886 --> 07:35.821
<i> [chris] some tension</i>
<i> on the faces of these captains</i>

07:35.823 --> 07:37.255
<i>  both looking to kick off</i>
<i>  the night</i>

07:37.257 --> 07:40.425
<i>  with a crucial first win</i>
<i>  of the season.</i>

07:44.031 --> 07:46.298
<i>  Let the bot battle begin.</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:49.234
<i>  Hypershock circling</i>
<i>  the drain on slammo!,</i>

07:49.236 --> 07:53.538
<i>  able to get underneath</i>
<i>  with those front forks</i>
<i>  and lands in clean shots.</i>

07:55.108 --> 07:58.009
<i>  Woah. Big hit.</i>

07:58.011 --> 08:01.913
<i> [kenny] we are seeing</i>
<i>  the speed advantage</i>
<i>  shot right away.</i>

08:01.915 --> 08:03.315
<i> [chris] oh, yeah.</i>

08:03.317 --> 08:05.717
-Keep your arms up.
Take him down.
-Yeah.

08:05.719 --> 08:10.155
<i> [chris] uh-oh.</i>
<i>  Hypershock smothering slammo!</i>
<i>  Here in the opening stretch.</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:12.858
<i>  Oh, and now backing it down</i>
<i>  in the short corner.</i>

08:12.860 --> 08:15.260
<i>  Geez! Holy smokes.</i>

08:15.262 --> 08:19.698
<i> [kenny] slammo! Trying</i>
<i>  to stay squared up</i>
<i>  when hypershock is too fast.</i>

08:19.700 --> 08:21.833
<i>  Oh, no.</i>

08:21.835 --> 08:25.804
<i>  Oh, just ran into</i>
<i> the fist, here, of will bales.</i>

08:25.806 --> 08:29.174
<i> [chris] and then gets</i>
<i>  slammed into the rail</i>
<i>  by will bales,</i>

08:29.176 --> 08:30.942
<i>  who's going in for more.</i>

08:30.944 --> 08:34.846
<i>  Going in slammo like</i>
<i>  a lion investigating a kill.</i>

08:34.848 --> 08:36.481
[crowd cheering]
hypershock! Hypershock!

08:36.483 --> 08:38.884
<i> [chris] oh, we could have</i>
<i>  a countdown coming.</i>

08:38.886 --> 08:40.118
Ten...

08:40.120 --> 08:41.186
<i> [chris] and there it is.</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:45.190
<i>  Danby never knew</i>
<i>  what hit him in this match.</i>

08:45.192 --> 08:49.828
<i>  Hypershock,</i>
<i>  too fast and too curious.</i>

08:49.830 --> 08:51.796
...One. And the match's over!

08:51.798 --> 08:54.599
[crowd screaming and cheering]

09:05.846 --> 09:09.447
[chris] kenny, hypershock
fast out of the gate,
really impressive.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.849
<i> [kenny] they sure were.</i>

09:10.884 --> 09:12.984
<i>  They kind of circled around</i>
<i>  their opponent</i>
<i>  for a little bit.</i>

09:12.986 --> 09:17.789
<i>  Got the angle and then</i>
<i>  just attacked nonstop,</i>
<i>  getting underneath them,</i>

09:17.791 --> 09:18.957
<i>  hitting them hard</i>
<i>  from the back,</i>

09:18.959 --> 09:20.292
<i>  hitting them hard</i>
<i>  from the side.</i>

09:20.294 --> 09:22.060
<i>  Tremendous driving there</i>
<i>  from will bales.</i>

09:22.062 --> 09:25.764
<i> [chris] and I thought,</i>
<i>  really the important thing</i>
<i>  was hypershock was grounded</i>

09:25.766 --> 09:27.799
<i>  the entire fight,</i>
<i>  sometimes in years past,</i>

09:27.801 --> 09:30.902
<i>  we've seen him deliver a shot</i>
<i>  and then</i>
<i>  wobbly all over the place.</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:32.604
<i> [kenny] well, I think</i>
<i> that's due to the new chassis.</i>

09:32.606 --> 09:33.738
<i>  You see, it's a lot wider.</i>

09:33.740 --> 09:34.839
<i>  It's a little bit longer.</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:35.907
<i>  It's gonna give it</i>
<i>  better stability.</i>

09:35.909 --> 09:38.043
<i>  But again,</i>
<i>  the speed was there.</i>

09:38.045 --> 09:41.012
<i>  Everything was just</i>
<i>  extremely impressive</i>
<i>  from that team.</i>

09:41.014 --> 09:42.814
<i> [chris] and I think</i>
<i>  what we've learned</i>
<i>  is if you get knocked</i>

09:42.816 --> 09:45.116
<i>  into that short corner</i>
<i>  next to the upper deck,</i>

09:45.118 --> 09:47.852
<i>  if you cannot work</i>
<i>  your way out of there,</i>
<i>  you're gonna be doa.</i>

09:47.854 --> 09:50.055
<i> [kenny] absolutely.</i>
<i>  They took</i>
<i>  full advantage of that.</i>

09:50.057 --> 09:52.591
<i>  They cornered their opponent</i>
<i>  and then took them out.</i>

09:55.262 --> 09:56.962
<i> [chris] will bales.</i>

09:57.998 --> 09:59.130
It did the thing.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.736
You... You have had enough
of will bales, the funny guy.

10:04.738 --> 10:10.175
I mean, it's time for people
to start taking you
and hypershock seriously, huh?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.810
It's nice
to have everything working,

10:11.812 --> 10:14.779
although, technically
the weapon wasn't "running"
at the end,

10:14.781 --> 10:16.815
but
it clearly did some damage.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.917
How does it feel to get
a win like that, man?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.919
Not only do you get a win,
but it was an exciting win,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.721
kind of a...
A vintage performance.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.955
It's been a little while.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.358
It's good. It's nice
to be back in the groove.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.360
You know, craig
and his team are wonderful.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.694
They're a great robot.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.029
Respect them greatly.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.131
But I've got the best team
here this year.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.200
[crowd cheering]

10:35.202 --> 10:38.269
when are you gonna dye
your hair green
like your teammate?

10:38.271 --> 10:39.371
Well, let's see how it goes.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.139
Oh, wait a second.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.108
How about if you get
a top 10 seed,

10:43.110 --> 10:45.243
you'll dye your hair
in the round of 32?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.512
[crowd cheering]

10:51.752 --> 10:55.186
fine, if we get a top 10 seed
in the round of 32,

10:55.188 --> 10:56.921
you can film me
dyeing my hair.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.024
Hey, there we go.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.029
Will bales has thrown down
the gauntlet.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.031
<i>  Congratulations</i>
<i>  on the fast start.</i>

11:06.033 --> 11:07.332
Thanks, guys.
Good to see you again.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.067
<i> [chris] you, too.</i>

11:09.069 --> 11:10.535
[all cheering]

11:12.639 --> 11:14.706
[will] congratulations.
We did it.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.474
Whoa, we did it!

11:21.948 --> 11:24.015
<i> [chris] I know</i>
<i>  it is just one win.</i>

11:24.017 --> 11:24.883
But you heard him.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.285
We made a bet that
if he cracks the top 10,

11:27.287 --> 11:30.088
I think we're gonna have
to throw a poll out there
on social media.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.757
<i>  What color should will bales</i>
<i>  dye his hair</i>

11:32.759 --> 11:35.026
<i>  if you have to live up</i>
<i>  to his end of the bargain?</i>

11:35.028 --> 11:37.195
Yah,
but what are you gonna do?
You just had him do a bet.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.797
You didn't put yourself
on the line.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.098
What are we gonna
do to your hair?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.199
I can't come out here
with pink hair.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.801
-Well, maybe I can.
-I think it will look nice.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.803
-Match your tie.
-Oh, nice.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.805
-Here we go. Let's do it.
-You know what? I'm in.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.207
If will bales is in,
chris rose is in.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.009
-I like it.
-Is kenny florian in?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.745
You are unbelievable.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.448
No, but you did the bet.
I was just sitting here.

11:56.450 --> 12:01.019
<i> [chris] hey, after a break</i>
<i>  can p1 motor his way</i>
<i>  to an early season win?</i>

12:01.021 --> 12:04.222
<i>  Or will valkyrie pour sugar</i>
<i>  in his gas tank?</i>

12:04.224 --> 12:06.624
<i> Find out next on battlebots.</i>

12:06.626 --> 12:08.426
[crowd cheering]

12:17.104 --> 12:18.536
we are back
<i> on battlebots.</i>

12:18.538 --> 12:20.972
That is kenny florian,
I am chris rose.

12:20.974 --> 12:25.143
<i>  Up next, we've got</i>
<i>  a showdown</i>
<i>  featuring valkyrie and p1.</i>

12:25.145 --> 12:29.948
<i>  Let's start with</i>
<i>  captain leanne cushing</i>
<i>  and valkyrie squad.</i>

12:29.950 --> 12:34.285
<i>  Last season, they had</i>
<i>  their most successful run</i>
<i>  yet in battlebots.</i>

12:34.287 --> 12:37.922
<i>  Went all the way to the round</i>
<i>  of 16 before bowing out</i>
<i>  against whiplash.</i>

12:37.924 --> 12:39.557
<i>  No shame in that.</i>

12:39.559 --> 12:44.229
<i>  Kenny, leanne is gaining</i>
<i>  a reputation for her tactics</i>
<i>  and her fight iq.</i>

12:44.231 --> 12:49.534
<i>  And, oh, yeah,</i>
<i>  her bot was voted 2020's</i>
<i>  most destructive as well.</i>

12:49.536 --> 12:51.770
<i> [kenny] that combination</i>
<i>  is a winning formula.</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:55.206
<i>  Valkyrie is so versatile with</i>
<i>  their primary weapon options.</i>

12:55.208 --> 12:57.342
<i>  This team is always</i>
<i>  playing chess,</i>

12:57.344 --> 13:00.178
<i>  looking to counter</i>
<i>  their opponent.</i>

13:00.180 --> 13:02.280
Tonight,
they are squaring off
against p1

13:02.282 --> 13:04.816
captained by brandon zelinsky.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.918
<i>  Kenny, I thought there were</i>
<i>  significant improvement</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:09.721
<i>  during the 2020</i>
<i>  season out of this robot.</i>

13:09.723 --> 13:11.856
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  this team was very close</i>

13:11.858 --> 13:13.625
<i>  to making</i>
<i>  the tournament last year,</i>

13:13.627 --> 13:15.093
<i>  but its wins over smee</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:19.197
<i>  and chronos didn't move</i>
<i>  the dial enough</i>
<i>  to convince the committee.</i>

13:19.199 --> 13:22.133
<i>  But brandon is back</i>
<i>  this season with a chip</i>
<i>  on his shoulder</i>

13:22.135 --> 13:26.137
<i>  and determined to drive</i>
<i>  p1 into the winner's circle.</i>

13:26.139 --> 13:30.041
<i>  And even though he's facing</i>
<i>  a highly dangerous</i>
<i>  opponent here in valkyrie,</i>

13:30.043 --> 13:33.978
<i>  p1 has the speed</i>
<i>  and durability</i>
<i>  to be a menace out there.</i>

13:33.980 --> 13:37.015
<i> [chris] all right.</i>
<i>  Should we be on upset alert?</i>

13:38.018 --> 13:40.652
Let's find out
and send it over to faruq.

13:42.989 --> 13:47.458
In the red square
from somerville,
massachusetts,

13:47.460 --> 13:50.862
this bot is here to
ragna-rock your world.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.132
It's valkyrie!

13:56.837 --> 14:00.104
<i> [chris] team valkyrie</i>
<i> always ready to put on a show.</i>

14:00.106 --> 14:02.607
<i>  We talked about</i>
<i>  their limitless arsenal,</i>

14:02.609 --> 14:05.410
<i>  so what weapon</i>
<i>  are they going with tonight,</i>
<i>  kenny?</i>

14:05.412 --> 14:07.078
[kenny]
<i>  they're debuting a new blade.</i>

14:07.080 --> 14:09.080
<i>  It's called dr. Acula.</i>

14:09.082 --> 14:13.852
<i>  This blade actually</i>
<i>  has the s7 tooth</i>
<i>  inserted into the blade</i>

14:13.854 --> 14:18.189
<i>  that's gonna do</i>
<i>  chunky damage to a wedge</i>
<i>  and especially wheels.</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:23.962
<i>  If valkyrie can out drive p1,</i>
<i>  we should see plenty of metal</i>
<i>  flying around the box.</i>

14:25.265 --> 14:27.198
[crowd cheering]

14:27.200 --> 14:30.969
in the blue square
from hudson, new hampshire,

14:30.971 --> 14:34.772
he'll drape a checkered flag
over your closed casting,

14:34.774 --> 14:38.409
it's p1!

14:41.748 --> 14:47.018
<i> [chris] all right, kenny,</i>
<i> what's it going to take for p1</i>
<i>  to put the sport on notice?</i>

14:47.020 --> 14:50.755
<i> [kenny] well, a win</i>
<i>  over valkyrie would be</i>
<i>  a statement for sure.</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:53.124
<i>  Brandon's given p1</i>
<i>  the full overhaul.</i>

14:53.126 --> 14:55.994
<i>  He shortened the chassis,</i>
<i>  added weight to the wedges,</i>

14:55.996 --> 14:58.363
<i>  installed some magnets</i>
<i>  for stability.</i>

14:58.365 --> 15:01.599
<i>  The bot's ready.</i>
<i>  We'll see if brandon is too.</i>

15:01.601 --> 15:05.203
[crowd cheering]
p1! P1! P1! P1!

15:10.043 --> 15:12.243
<i>  We're not</i>
<i> in the little leagues anymore.</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:14.812
<i>  We're fighting a real robot</i>
<i>  who's a real chance</i>
<i>  at the nut.</i>

15:14.814 --> 15:17.048
<i>  If they go shooting</i>
<i> in the air, we're in business.</i>

15:17.050 --> 15:20.985
<i>  If not, we're probably</i>
<i>  gonna have to sit on</i>
<i>  or under their weapon</i>

15:20.987 --> 15:24.522
<i>  as long as possible</i>
<i>  and just grind away</i>
<i>  at their weapon to try</i>

15:24.524 --> 15:26.791
<i>  and make it thermal shock</i>
<i>  and fail.</i>

15:26.793 --> 15:28.893
<i>  Valkyrie might be</i>
<i>  looking across the pit</i>
<i>  and they say,</i>

15:28.895 --> 15:30.295
<i>  "oh, these guys have</i>
<i>  no spinning weapon</i>

15:30.297 --> 15:32.096
<i>  just a drive,</i>
<i>  just a lifter."</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:34.232
<i>  they're gonna be</i>
<i>  in for a surprise tonight.</i>

15:34.234 --> 15:37.101
<i>  We've made valkyrie</i>
<i>  stronger with both our drive</i>

15:37.103 --> 15:39.904
<i>  and our speed at which</i>
<i>  our weapon spins up.</i>

15:39.906 --> 15:41.940
<i>  We were able</i>
<i>  to save some weight</i>

15:41.942 --> 15:44.042
<i>  and also get a bit</i>
<i>  more shoving power</i>

15:44.044 --> 15:46.144
<i>  and stay as fast as</i>
<i>  we were last years.</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:47.312
<i>  We're looking</i>
<i>  to not get flipped</i>

15:47.314 --> 15:49.180
<i>  because it's going to put us</i>
<i>  at a disadvantage</i>

15:49.182 --> 15:52.250
<i>  because p1 is lower</i>
<i>  to the ground than us.</i>

15:52.252 --> 15:55.553
<i>  We sit just under a foot tall</i>
<i>  and they beat us in that,</i>

15:55.555 --> 15:58.990
<i>  and I'm really worried</i>
<i>  that if we're inverted,</i>

15:58.992 --> 16:01.492
<i>  we're not gonna have</i>
<i>  much to do except for try</i>
<i>  to recover</i>

16:01.494 --> 16:03.628
<i>  and figure out a way</i>
<i>  to flip back over.</i>

16:05.165 --> 16:06.698
[crowd cheering]

16:06.700 --> 16:08.599
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

16:09.936 --> 16:12.737
<i> [chris] both teams</i>
<i>  are locked, loaded,</i>

16:12.739 --> 16:16.307
<i>  and looking for an excuse</i>
<i>  to exchange insurance info.</i>

16:21.047 --> 16:23.247
[automated voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

16:24.884 --> 16:26.517
[crowd cheering]

16:29.255 --> 16:31.556
[automated voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

16:33.226 --> 16:35.393
[crowd cheering]

16:50.977 --> 16:52.844
<i> [chris] here we go.</i>

16:52.846 --> 16:57.615
<i>  P1 and valkyrie,</i>
<i>  an opening win is so crucial.</i>

16:57.617 --> 16:59.617
<i>  Who wants it more?</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:04.288
<i>  Let the bot battle begin.</i>

17:04.290 --> 17:08.626
<i>  P1 under charge against up</i>
<i>  under valkyrie in a hurry.</i>

17:08.628 --> 17:11.863
<i> [kenny] oh, that's some</i>
<i>  serious speed there for p1.</i>

17:11.865 --> 17:13.097
<i> -[chris] oh, man.</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh.</i>

17:13.099 --> 17:16.501
<i> [chris] oh. P1 not afraid</i>
<i>  to stick his nose in there...</i>

17:16.503 --> 17:18.336
<i> -[kenny] wow!</i>
<i> -[chris]</i>
<i> ...But a wheel is off already.</i>

17:18.338 --> 17:20.004
<i>  Oh.</i>

17:20.006 --> 17:22.874
<i> [kenny] p1 absorbing</i>
<i>  some damage here, chris,</i>

17:22.876 --> 17:25.710
<i>  but leanne cushing needs</i>
<i>  to be careful.</i>

17:25.712 --> 17:31.516
<i>  P1 is so much lower</i>
<i>  than valkyrie,</i>
<i> getting underneath it at will.</i>

17:31.518 --> 17:35.119
<i> [chris] ah! Look at</i>
<i>  that gyroscopic force.</i>

17:35.121 --> 17:38.056
<i>  Valkyrie just dangling there</i>
<i>  in the air almost.</i>

17:38.058 --> 17:39.924
<i>  Oh, man!</i>

17:39.926 --> 17:43.061
<i> [kenny] brandon zalinsky</i>
<i>  getting</i>
<i>  the lifter involved there.</i>

17:43.063 --> 17:47.632
<i> P1 continues to get low ground</i>
<i>  and use that</i>
<i>  horizontal spinner's energy</i>

17:47.634 --> 17:49.200
<i>  against itself.</i>

17:50.170 --> 17:51.969
[man]
oh, now it's on fire.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.105
<i> [chris] that looks like</i>
<i>  valkyrie is on fire.</i>

17:54.107 --> 17:55.973
<i>  It is smoking.</i>

17:55.975 --> 17:58.042
<i> [kenny] and p1 has</i>
<i>  valkyrie in for it now.</i>

17:58.044 --> 17:59.944
<i>  Leanne cushing warned us.</i>

17:59.946 --> 18:02.413
<i>  She was worried</i>
<i>  about the scenario.</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:04.949
[chris]
<i> it is spinning out of control.</i>

18:04.951 --> 18:06.250
<i>  Has it lost its weapon?</i>

18:06.252 --> 18:09.220
<i>  That's the big question,</i>
<i>  the drive is still working.</i>

18:09.222 --> 18:11.989
<i> [kenny] yep, that fire inside</i>
<i>  of valkyrie there,</i>

18:11.991 --> 18:14.325
<i>  could have been</i>
<i>  the weapon motor.</i>

18:14.327 --> 18:17.995
<i> [chris] now for p1,</i>
<i> does it have its drive intact?</i>

18:17.997 --> 18:20.665
<i>  Valkyrie's weapon</i>
<i>  not working</i>

18:20.667 --> 18:22.834
<i>  and it's taking a shot</i>
<i>  from the pulverizer.</i>

18:22.836 --> 18:24.435
<i> [kenny] some friendly</i>
<i>  fire there, chris.</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:26.337
<i>  That was</i>
<i>  valkyrie's pulverizer.</i>

18:26.339 --> 18:27.738
<i> [chris] oh, another one.</i>

18:27.740 --> 18:28.906
[leanne] just go back.
Just go back. Just, no.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.342
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop!

18:31.344 --> 18:34.812
<i> [chris] okay, seems like</i>
<i>  there's some serious chaos</i>
<i>  on team valkyrie's side</i>

18:34.814 --> 18:36.414
<i>  of the driver's deck.</i>

18:36.416 --> 18:38.382
<i> [kenny] I think,</i>
<i>  they were trying</i>
<i>  to flip valkyrie</i>

18:38.384 --> 18:41.119
<i>  right side up</i>
<i>  using the pulverizer.</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:42.420
<i>  Risky.</i>

18:42.455 --> 18:45.223
<i> [chris] labeled</i>
<i>  the most destructive bot</i>
<i>  a season ago,</i>

18:45.225 --> 18:47.825
<i>  but right now,</i>
<i>  the weapon is not active.</i>

18:47.827 --> 18:50.561
<i>  The drive</i>
<i>  isn't working entirely.</i>

18:50.563 --> 18:53.431
<i>  Major frustration</i>
<i>  for valkyrie.</i>

18:53.433 --> 18:55.633
[referee] valkyrie,
you got to show me
controlled movement.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.637
[chris]
<i>  you hear the ref issuing</i>
<i>  a warning to valkyrie there.</i>

18:59.639 --> 19:04.709
<i>  Remember p1 as it continues</i>
<i>  to engage that can have</i>
<i>  an effect on engines</i>

19:04.711 --> 19:07.979
<i>  ending the fight</i>
<i>  and stopping a countdown,</i>
<i>  kenny,</i>

19:07.981 --> 19:11.782
<i>  but p1's drive not looking</i>
<i>  all that hot at the moment,</i>
<i>  either.</i>

19:11.784 --> 19:14.519
<i> [kenny] I think</i>
<i>  it's showing more movement</i>
<i>  than valkyrie here.</i>

19:14.521 --> 19:17.989
<i>  Brandon zalinsky</i>
<i>  continuing to engage.</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:22.160
<i>  I think it's struggling</i>
<i>  because of that lack</i>
<i> of wheel on that left backside</i>

19:22.162 --> 19:24.829
[chris]
<i>  fifteen seconds left to go.</i>

19:24.831 --> 19:29.634
<i>  And there's p1 showing</i>
<i>  it still has function</i>
<i>  in that lifter.</i>

19:29.636 --> 19:32.637
<i> [kenny] this would be</i>
<i>  a huge upset if p1</i>

19:32.639 --> 19:34.906
<i>  is able to get it done</i>
<i>  against valkyrie.</i>

19:34.908 --> 19:38.409
<i> [chris] remember,</i>
<i>  they were big time underdogs</i>
<i>  coming into this fight.</i>

19:38.411 --> 19:41.612
Oh, my...
Oh, my god, we did it!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.147
Oh, my god.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.684
<i> [chris] team p1 thinks</i>
<i>  they've got the w,</i>

19:46.686 --> 19:51.022
<i>  but this one</i>
<i>  is going to the judges.</i>

19:51.024 --> 19:54.859
<i>  All three are former</i>
<i> battlebots participants.</i>

19:54.861 --> 19:58.963
<i>  Derek young, jason bardis,</i>
<i>  lisa winter.</i>

19:58.965 --> 20:03.201
<i>  Once again, it's an 11-point</i>
<i>  scoring system</i>
<i>  for the battlebots judges.</i>

20:03.203 --> 20:06.871
<i>  They could award up</i>
<i>  to five points</i>
<i>  in the damage category,</i>

20:06.873 --> 20:10.007
<i>  three for aggression</i>
<i>  and three for control.</i>

20:11.244 --> 20:13.978
<i>  So, kenny,</i>
<i>  how did you see it play out?</i>

20:13.980 --> 20:16.881
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  leanne told us</i>
<i>  she was worried about p1</i>

20:16.883 --> 20:20.051
<i>  getting underneath her robot</i>
<i>  and boy, was she right?</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:23.521
<i>  Because that proved</i>
<i>  to be valkyrie's kryptonite</i>
<i>  in this match.</i>

20:23.523 --> 20:28.526
<i>  P1 used its speed</i>
<i>  and low profile</i>
<i>  to repeatedly upend valkyrie</i>

20:28.528 --> 20:30.127
<i>  and dictate the action.</i>

20:30.163 --> 20:34.665
<i> [chris] p1 did suffer</i>
<i>  some damage in the process,</i>
<i>  though, losing a wheel</i>

20:34.667 --> 20:38.803
<i>  and taking a flurry of shots</i>
<i>  to its lifter and top armor.</i>

20:38.805 --> 20:41.606
<i>  But eventually, it was able</i>
<i>  to break valkyrie's weapon,</i>

20:41.608 --> 20:44.809
<i>  which was brandon zalinsky's</i>
<i>  goal from the very start.</i>

20:44.811 --> 20:48.112
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  and that's where things</i>
<i>  could get interesting</i>

20:48.114 --> 20:51.882
<i>  because the most</i>
<i>  heavily weighted category</i>
<i>  in the damage column</i>

20:51.884 --> 20:54.619
<i>  is damage done</i>
<i>  by a primary weapon.</i>

20:54.621 --> 20:57.154
<i>  You can argue that</i>
<i>  valkyrie scored points</i>
<i>  with its spinner,</i>

20:57.156 --> 21:00.391
<i>  while p1 did most of</i>
<i> his dirty work with its wedge.</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:04.795
<i>  But in terms of the eye test,</i>
<i>  valkyrie flying around</i>
<i>  the box, the fire</i>

21:04.797 --> 21:06.230
<i>  it suffered halfway through,</i>

21:06.232 --> 21:09.734
<i>  you have to imagine p1</i>
<i>  has the leg up here.</i>

21:09.736 --> 21:12.069
<i> [chris] both bots are</i>
<i>  a little punch-drunk</i>

21:12.071 --> 21:14.238
<i>  as the final seconds</i>
<i>  ticked away.</i>

21:14.240 --> 21:16.774
<i>  Faruq has the results.</i>

21:16.776 --> 21:20.278
<i>  Let's see which way</i>
<i>  the judges chose to go.</i>

21:21.981 --> 21:25.082
The results
from the judges are in.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.985
[crowd cheering]

21:30.256 --> 21:34.325
the winner
by unanimous decision is...

21:38.464 --> 21:40.097
[woman in crowd]
p1.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.500
P1!

21:54.113 --> 21:56.614
[chris]
<i>  all right, then, there it is.</i>

21:56.616 --> 22:01.352
<i>  You can see the excitement</i>
<i>  and the relief on the faces</i>
<i>  of team p1,</i>

22:01.354 --> 22:05.323
<i>  that was a gutsy effort.</i>
<i>  Their bot's a little worse</i>
<i>  for wear,</i>

22:05.325 --> 22:08.626
<i>  but in the end,</i>
<i>  the judges awarded</i>
<i>  the unanimous decision</i>

22:08.628 --> 22:13.197
<i>  and they have the coveted</i>
<i>  1-0 start to their season.</i>

22:13.199 --> 22:18.502
<i>  All right, coming up next,</i>
<i>  it's the battle bots debut</i>
<i>  of the rookie riptide.</i>

22:20.073 --> 22:23.341
<i> And there's its opponent, hard</i>
<i>  to miss inside the test box,</i>

22:23.343 --> 22:26.210
<i>  it's huge.</i>

22:27.847 --> 22:29.280
<i>  Stick around for the fight.</i>

22:29.282 --> 22:32.383
<i>  Next on battlebots.</i>

22:38.024 --> 22:39.590
We continue
<i> on with battlebots.</i>

22:39.592 --> 22:41.292
<i>  Next up on the fight card,</i>

22:41.294 --> 22:47.031
<i>  it's huge versus riptide.</i>
<i>  In a field widely considered</i>
<i>  to be the most stacked</i>

22:47.033 --> 22:49.867
<i>  and most dangerous</i>
<i>  in battlebots ' history,</i>

22:49.869 --> 22:53.137
<i>  it's an intimidating time</i>
<i>  to be a rookie.</i>

22:53.139 --> 22:57.842
<i>  Just ask switchback,</i>
<i>  who we saw take the l</i>
<i>  on opening night.</i>

22:57.844 --> 23:01.612
<i>  Historically, new captains</i>
<i>  struggle to break</i>
<i>  into the tournament,</i>

23:01.614 --> 23:04.348
<i>  let alone make it</i>
<i>  past the round of 32.</i>

23:04.350 --> 23:09.987
<i>  But young captain ethan kurtz</i>
<i>  is out to prove that he</i>
<i>  and his bot, riptide, belong.</i>

23:11.891 --> 23:13.057
[ethan] is that bolt tight?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.892
[indistinct chatter]

23:14.894 --> 23:18.095
my name is ethan kurtz.
I am the captain of riptide.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.165
<i>  Riptide</i>
<i>  is a egg beater spinner.</i>

23:21.167 --> 23:23.968
<i>  We've been</i>
<i>  heavily inspired by yeti.</i>

23:23.970 --> 23:31.275
We love yeti's lifters
and we also love that yeti
had a very long, wide drum.

23:31.277 --> 23:35.980
<i>  We want a huge spinner</i>
<i>  putting out all the mass</i>
<i>  on the weapon as possible</i>

23:35.982 --> 23:37.281
<i>  for the best energy transfer.</i>

23:37.283 --> 23:39.950
And that's how riptide,
kind of, was formed.

23:39.952 --> 23:43.854
<i>  Our biggest strength</i>
<i>  is our 55-pound drum</i>

23:43.856 --> 23:47.992
<i>  that spins at 190 miles</i>
<i>  per hour plus.</i>

23:47.994 --> 23:51.595
We launched a 20 pound
medicine ball,
200 feet in air.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.132
<i>  We've launched</i>
<i>  a 300-pound tire</i>
<i>  10 foot into the air.</i>

23:55.134 --> 23:59.236
We're just a fan
of big effing weapons.

23:59.238 --> 24:03.007
<i>  For a rookie team,</i>
<i>  we are all really stoked</i>
<i>  to get in the battlebots</i>

24:03.009 --> 24:05.643
<i>  because we really</i>
<i>  wanted to be here.</i>

24:05.645 --> 24:08.446
<i> We all kind of knew each other</i>
<i>  from</i>
<i>  the vex robotics competition.</i>

24:08.448 --> 24:10.080
<i>  We all wanted to do</i>
<i>  something together.</i>

24:10.082 --> 24:13.083
<i>  Battlebots</i>
<i> was the hardest thing</i>
<i> we could think of.</i>

24:13.886 --> 24:16.720
<i>  My father is on the team.</i>

24:16.722 --> 24:20.825
<i>  He's experienced with,</i>
<i>  like, radios and rc planes</i>
<i>  in the old days,</i>

24:20.827 --> 24:22.126
<i>  so he knows</i>
<i>  how to troubleshoot things,</i>

24:22.128 --> 24:24.261
<i>  he's been really,</i>
<i>  really helpful.</i>

24:24.263 --> 24:27.865
<i>  Being captain,</i>
<i>  absolutely thrilled,</i>
<i>  and this is a lifelong dream.</i>

24:27.867 --> 24:30.034
<i>  I'm just really,</i>
<i>  really excited.</i>

24:30.036 --> 24:32.436
I just wanna get out there
and hit something.

24:35.608 --> 24:39.043
<i> [chris] riptide now</i>
<i>  just moments away</i>
<i>  from making its debut</i>

24:39.045 --> 24:41.745
<i>  on the big stage.</i>

24:41.747 --> 24:43.948
And when ethan found out
that he was gonna be
<i> on battlebots,</i>

24:43.950 --> 24:45.683
he said it was
a dream come true.

24:45.685 --> 24:49.386
<i>  But he may be facing a</i>
<i>  welcome-to-the-big-leagues</i>
<i>  moment here</i>

24:49.388 --> 24:54.124
<i>  as he takes on huge,</i>
<i>  captained by, a very</i>
<i>  motivated, jonathan schultz.</i>

24:54.126 --> 24:55.926
<i>  He's coming off</i>
<i>  a rather disappointing</i>

24:55.928 --> 24:58.729
<i>  and often frustrating</i>
<i>  2020 season,</i>

24:58.731 --> 25:01.465
<i>  but this is still</i>
<i> a very dangerous robot, kenny.</i>

25:01.467 --> 25:03.200
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>
<i>  And, you know,</i>
<i>  the interesting thing</i>

25:03.202 --> 25:05.936
<i>  for me here is that just</i>
<i>  a short time ago,</i>

25:05.938 --> 25:08.906
<i>  it was huge that was</i>
<i>  the untested rookie</i>

25:08.908 --> 25:10.374
<i>  with something to prove.</i>

25:10.409 --> 25:13.978
<i>  But after three seasons,</i>
<i>  this robot has been</i>
<i>  around the block.</i>

25:13.980 --> 25:15.613
<i>  They know</i>
<i>  what it takes to win.</i>

25:15.615 --> 25:19.149
<i>  And I think</i>
<i>  the team's experience</i>
<i> should be the difference maker</i>

25:19.151 --> 25:21.051
<i>  in this match up.</i>

25:21.053 --> 25:22.786
Faruq, take it away.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.822
[crowd cheering]

25:24.824 --> 25:28.993
in the red square,
from south windsor,
connecticut,

25:28.995 --> 25:32.863
the bot's so big, it gave
shaquille o'neal nightmares.

25:32.865 --> 25:37.101
It's huge!

25:38.471 --> 25:39.837
[chris]
<i>  all right. Here we go.</i>

25:39.839 --> 25:42.640
<i> The iconic big wheels of huge.</i>

25:42.642 --> 25:48.145
<i>  Kenny, will this be the year</i>
<i>  huge puts it all together</i>
<i>  and makes a deep run?</i>

25:48.147 --> 25:50.981
<i> [kenny] well, listen,</i>
<i>  jonathan tells us the motor</i>
<i>  on the weapon</i>

25:50.983 --> 25:54.218
<i>  is twice as powerful,</i>
<i>  much more reliable.</i>

25:54.220 --> 25:56.687
<i>  He's ready</i>
<i> to put last season behind him,</i>

25:56.689 --> 25:59.023
<i>  and he's gotta love</i>
<i>  this matchup.</i>

25:59.025 --> 26:03.627
<i>  Riptide is low to the ground</i>
<i>  and right in the sweet spot</i>
<i>  for huge's weapon.</i>

26:08.167 --> 26:12.336
In the blue square,
from tarzana, california,

26:12.338 --> 26:15.873
keep out,
this water is not fine at all.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.176
It's riptide!

26:21.847 --> 26:24.982
<i> [chris] and there we get</i>
<i>  our first live look</i>
<i>  at riptide.</i>

26:24.984 --> 26:28.185
<i>  You can see</i>
<i>  the overall excitement</i>
<i>  from this squad.</i>

26:28.187 --> 26:31.255
<i>  Ethan told us,</i>
<i>  he didn't sleep</i>
<i>  a wink last night.</i>

26:31.257 --> 26:33.190
<i>  So, the question here</i>
<i>  is can he shake off</i>
<i>  the nerves</i>

26:33.192 --> 26:34.592
<i>  and steal a win, kenny?</i>

26:34.594 --> 26:35.926
[kenny]
<i>  hey, anything is possible.</i>

26:35.928 --> 26:39.163
<i>  They've added a wedge to try</i>
<i>  and mitigate some big hits.</i>

26:39.165 --> 26:43.934
<i>  And riptide has that</i>
<i>  egg beater style weapon</i>
<i>  that spins up quickly.</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:45.803
<i>  This is a bot designed</i>
<i>  for aggression.</i>

26:45.805 --> 26:48.639
<i>  The big question,</i>
<i>  will ethan hesitate</i>

26:48.641 --> 26:51.408
<i>  or will he put the pedal</i>
<i>  to the metal?</i>

26:57.650 --> 26:59.149
<i>  Against huge,</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:02.920
<i>  our strategy is just</i>
<i>  to be full aggressive,</i>
<i>  full on yeti pounding.</i>

27:02.922 --> 27:05.522
<i>  We're thinking that</i>
<i>  we could spin up</i>
<i>  faster than them,</i>

27:05.524 --> 27:09.093
<i>  box rush them</i>
<i>  and keep them from actually</i>
<i>  spinning up their weapon.</i>

27:09.095 --> 27:12.162
<i>  The only thing that</i>
<i>  we could really hit</i>
<i>  and actually, you know,</i>

27:12.164 --> 27:13.764
<i>  grab into is their weapon.</i>

27:13.766 --> 27:16.934
<i>  Their wheel is ably,</i>
<i>  and they're really hard</i>
<i>  to get bite on.</i>

27:16.936 --> 27:19.036
<i>  When we first learned</i>
<i> that we're going against huge,</i>

27:19.038 --> 27:22.740
<i>  we're like,</i>
<i>  "this is our counter,</i>
<i>  why huge?"</i>

27:22.742 --> 27:25.042
<i>  but we're gonna</i>
<i>  do our best and we're</i>
<i>  gonna give it our all,</i>

27:25.044 --> 27:26.243
<i>  and it's gonna be</i>
<i>  a great fight.</i>

27:26.245 --> 27:29.146
<i>  He's the type of robot that</i>
<i>  we think we like to fight.</i>

27:29.148 --> 27:31.215
<i>  He's very low,</i>
<i>  his weapon's pretty low,</i>

27:31.217 --> 27:33.617
<i>  and we know that</i>
<i>  it's gonna take</i>
<i>  a lot of work for him</i>

27:33.619 --> 27:35.619
<i>  to really get high enough</i>
<i>  to actually damage</i>

27:35.621 --> 27:37.521
<i>  some of the more</i>
<i>  important parts of our robot.</i>

27:37.523 --> 27:41.025
<i>  I like the chances,</i>
<i>  but I'm never gonna say,</i>
<i>  we're gonna win a fight.</i>

27:41.027 --> 27:44.595
<i>  We want this season</i>
<i>  to go well because</i>
<i>  we want it to show that</i>

27:44.597 --> 27:48.932
<i> last season was a fluke for us</i>
<i>  and get back to the level of</i>
<i>  performance that we used to.</i>

27:50.603 --> 27:52.536
[crowd cheering]

28:01.113 --> 28:03.447
<i> [chris] big test</i>
<i>  for the rookie here, kenny.</i>

28:03.449 --> 28:05.182
<i> [kenny] hey,</i>
<i>  no pressure, right?</i>

28:05.317 --> 28:10.621
<i>  Just your battlebots debut</i>
<i>  against huge in front of</i>
<i>  a pumped up vegas crowd.</i>

28:10.623 --> 28:12.389
<i>  Let it ride, riptide.</i>

28:12.391 --> 28:14.391
[crowd applauding]

28:16.028 --> 28:18.295
[chris]
let the bot battle begin.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.865
<i>  And, oh, the box rush</i>
<i>  by the rookie,</i>
<i>  getting under huge.</i>

28:21.867 --> 28:24.935
<i>  Oh! My goodness.</i>

28:24.937 --> 28:26.303
Let's go!

28:26.305 --> 28:28.005
[chris]
<i>  a ridiculous shot by riptide.</i>

28:28.007 --> 28:31.241
<i>  And now pushing huge</i>
<i>  into the screws as well.</i>

28:31.243 --> 28:33.877
<i> [kenny] oh, I think,</i>
<i>  he wedged him in there,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

28:33.879 --> 28:35.913
<i> [chris] is huge stuck?</i>

28:35.915 --> 28:38.182
<i>  The little screw should</i>
<i>  actually reverse--</i>

28:38.184 --> 28:39.750
[referee] I gotta see him
get out.

28:39.752 --> 28:43.020
<i> [kenny] it should, but</i>
<i>  jonathan schultz is getting</i>
<i>  a warning from the ref.</i>

28:43.022 --> 28:46.957
<i>  And I'm not sure,</i>
<i>  he can get out of there</i>
<i>  without some help, chris.</i>

28:46.959 --> 28:50.160
<i>  And now look at this,</i>
<i>  riptide is leaning</i>
<i>  on those big wheels</i>

28:50.162 --> 28:51.395
<i>  and there goes</i>
<i>  the screws.</i>

28:51.397 --> 28:53.030
<i>  Can huge escape?</i>

28:53.032 --> 28:53.831
[referee] ten seconds,
back off.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.499
<i> [chris] wow!</i>

28:55.501 --> 28:59.236
<i>  The ref instructing</i>
<i> ethan kurtz to stop corralling</i>
<i>  and get out of there, kid.</i>

28:59.238 --> 29:02.106
<i>  Huge just floundering.</i>
<i>  Those plastic wheels,</i>

29:02.108 --> 29:03.907
<i>  they can't get any traction.</i>

29:03.909 --> 29:06.009
<i>  And here comes the countdown!</i>

29:06.011 --> 29:09.279
<i>  Huge just has</i>
<i>  a few seconds left</i>
<i>  to get out of there.</i>

29:09.281 --> 29:11.415
<i> - Can he do it?</i>
<i> -[referee] ...Five, four...</i>

29:11.417 --> 29:13.083
-[chris] it's so close.
-Three...

29:13.085 --> 29:16.253
...Two, one.
That's a knock out.

29:16.255 --> 29:21.024
<i> [chris] that is a knock out.</i>
<i>  The rookie riptide.</i>

29:21.026 --> 29:24.294
<i>  What a huge upset.</i>

29:28.300 --> 29:31.602
<i> [chris] kenny, talk about</i>
<i>  a rookie making a statement</i>
<i>  out of the gate?</i>

29:31.604 --> 29:32.803
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  this was unbelievable.</i>

29:32.805 --> 29:35.139
<i>  I mean,</i>
<i>  the knockout shot basically,</i>

29:35.141 --> 29:38.842
<i>  happened right at the start,</i>
<i>  got some chips off of huge.</i>

29:38.844 --> 29:40.210
<i>  Look at that shot.</i>

29:40.212 --> 29:41.879
<i>  I mean, that is some</i>
<i>  serious power right there.</i>

29:41.881 --> 29:46.250
<i> [chris] and ethan kurtz</i>
<i>  followed it up by pushing</i>
<i>  huge into the screws,</i>

29:46.252 --> 29:51.355
<i>  that big old uhmw wheel</i>
<i>  got hung up</i>
<i>  and that was all she wrote.</i>

29:51.357 --> 29:54.358
<i>  Riptide with the upset.</i>

29:57.997 --> 30:00.063
[chris] ethan,
can you hear us?

30:00.065 --> 30:03.534
I hear you. Yeah!

30:05.805 --> 30:07.437
I just killed my throat.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.708
Ethan, what is pumping
through your veins
right now, my man?

30:11.710 --> 30:13.710
Our weapon
is freaking powerful.

30:13.712 --> 30:16.079
That's what's running
through my veins!

30:18.784 --> 30:21.185
Is this better than
you could have dreamt?

30:21.187 --> 30:25.322
Oh, yeah, we thought
they were just gonna spin down
and smash our weapon to bits.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.359
We did not actually
expect them
to spin up towards us,

30:29.361 --> 30:31.061
which is actually, exactly,
what we wanted.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.030
We didn't think
they were going to do that.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.966
-Hey, ethan,
I know you're a rookie--
-yeah.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.936
...And you've only had
a minute's worth of fight
<i> in battlebots,</i>

30:38.938 --> 30:40.337
but are you a contender?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.505
Yes.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.073
Hell, yes.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.176
Hell, yes.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.913
Hey, you're your pop stan
is behind you,
bring him up here.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.049
-Bring pops up here.
Hey, stan.
-Yeah.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.450
How proud are you of your son?

30:53.452 --> 30:56.019
I couldn't be more proud.
This is, it's amazing.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.923
He's a, he's an amazing guy
and it's just amazing
to see him do this

30:59.925 --> 31:02.292
and perform like this
<i> at battlebots . Amazing.</i>

31:02.294 --> 31:04.094
Did you almost shed a tear?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.230
Ah, I'm about to now
that you're asking.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.232
During the fight,
absolutely not.

31:08.234 --> 31:12.269
All right. Well, guys,
congratulations on your
<i> first ever battlebots victory.</i>

31:12.271 --> 31:13.937
Thank you.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.505
[crowd cheering]

31:16.709 --> 31:23.113
<i> [chris] an incredible debut</i>
<i>  from the new master</i>
<i>  of hype, ethan kurtz.</i>

31:23.115 --> 31:25.182
<i>  And if</i>
<i>  you're jonathan schultz,</i>
<i>  you just chalk it up to,</i>

31:25.184 --> 31:27.217
<i>  kind of, bad luck</i>
<i> that you got stuck back there.</i>

31:27.219 --> 31:30.888
I mean, really,
he wanted at least two
or a full three minutes

31:30.890 --> 31:34.291
in order to gauge
how this bot
was going to run in 2021.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.193
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  what an unfortunate start</i>
<i>  for huge,</i>

31:36.195 --> 31:39.830
<i>  especially coming off</i>
<i>  such a disappointing season.</i>

31:39.832 --> 31:42.966
<i>  This has to be frustrating</i>
<i>  for jonathan schultz,</i>
<i>  but listen,</i>

31:42.968 --> 31:44.434
<i>  all you could do</i>
<i>  is shake it off</i>

31:44.436 --> 31:47.838
<i>  and we'll see what this team</i>
<i>  is made of</i>
<i>  as the season rolls on.</i>

31:47.840 --> 31:49.072
<i>  Credit to riptide.</i>

31:49.074 --> 31:50.607
<i>  That's a big-time win.</i>

31:51.877 --> 31:54.144
Good job, rook. Good job.

31:54.146 --> 31:58.115
<i>  Coming up next,</i>
<i>  can fusion fuse his saw</i>
<i>  with his opponent's face</i>

31:58.117 --> 32:01.551
<i>  or will cobalt steal himself</i>
<i>  a victory?</i>

32:01.553 --> 32:07.057
<i>  And later, in our main event,</i>
<i>  a lot of vegas gamblers</i>
<i>  would call these two bots</i>

32:07.059 --> 32:10.861
<i>  odds-on favorites</i>
<i>  for a top seed</i>
<i>  in this year's tournament.</i>

32:10.863 --> 32:16.266
<i>  It's copperhead and lock-jaw</i>
<i>  exchanging bites tonight.</i>

32:16.268 --> 32:18.969
[donald hutson]
<i>  they're gonna be</i>
<i>  a very tough battle for me.</i>

32:18.971 --> 32:21.204
It's gonna be
much more of a bloodbath.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.609
I don't think, he's gonna,
wanna go weapon to weapon.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.980
<i>  That's what we're gonna</i>
<i>  want to do.</i>

32:39.525 --> 32:40.624
[crowd cheering]

32:40.626 --> 32:42.859
<i> [chris] we continue here</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

32:42.861 --> 32:46.964
<i>  And up next,</i>
<i>  cobalt makes its return</i>
<i>  to the battlebots</i>

32:46.966 --> 32:50.467
<i>  against none other than</i>
<i>  reese ewert and fusion.</i>

32:51.937 --> 32:56.239
<i>  And there he is,</i>
<i>  the youngest member</i>
<i>  of the famed ewert clan,</i>

32:56.241 --> 32:58.675
<i>  the first family</i>
<i>  of robot combat,</i>

32:58.677 --> 33:00.844
<i>  working on,</i>
<i>  what is a technologically,</i>

33:00.846 --> 33:04.948
<i>  ambitious fusion</i>
<i> with its dual primary weapons.</i>

33:06.352 --> 33:09.619
<i> Reese, obviously, has a lot of</i>
<i>  outside pressure on him.</i>

33:09.621 --> 33:12.289
<i>  The expectations</i>
<i>  of the family name,</i>

33:12.291 --> 33:16.226
<i>  being overshadowed</i>
<i>  by his older brother,</i>
<i>  jake and hydra,</i>

33:16.228 --> 33:18.695
<i>  last year's number one</i>
<i>  tournament seed.</i>

33:18.697 --> 33:21.631
<i>  But leaving all that legacy</i>
<i>  talk aside,</i>

33:21.633 --> 33:24.067
<i>  reese is running a bot</i>
<i>  that just hasn't been able</i>

33:24.069 --> 33:26.136
<i>  to string together</i>
<i>  successful fights.</i>

33:26.138 --> 33:28.905
Last season, I called it
the fusion confusion.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.208
It seemed, like,
I didn't know what was,
what it wanted to do.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.843
<i>  When it worked,</i>
<i>  it looked promising.</i>

33:32.845 --> 33:35.979
<i>  When it didn't, well,</i>
<i>  it basically exploded.</i>

33:35.981 --> 33:39.883
<i>  And that inconsistency left</i>
<i>  a bitter taste</i>
<i>  in reese's mouth.</i>

33:39.885 --> 33:42.753
<i>  In the off season,</i>
<i>  he shipped out</i>
<i>  the bot speed controllers</i>

33:42.755 --> 33:46.289
<i>  to the manufacturer,</i>
<i>  hoping to put</i>
<i>  an end to the fire issue.</i>

33:46.291 --> 33:49.159
<i>  But the jury's out</i>
<i> on whether it's been resolved.</i>

33:49.161 --> 33:52.062
<i>  That unpredictability</i>
<i>  causes a lot of stress.</i>

33:52.064 --> 33:56.166
<i>  But as we know, if he can get</i>
<i>  the technical issues</i>
<i>  under control,</i>

33:56.168 --> 34:00.103
<i>  this bot has the ability</i>
<i>  to hang with the best.</i>

34:01.440 --> 34:02.939
[crowd cheering]

34:02.975 --> 34:06.076
<i> [chris] you know,</i>
<i>  there's a whole lot of talent</i>
<i>  in the ewert gene pool.</i>

34:06.078 --> 34:10.013
<i>  Fusion, certainly a bot</i>
<i>  to keep your eye on in 2021,</i>

34:10.015 --> 34:14.084
<i>  especially, if they can</i>
<i>  take down</i>
<i> a very tough opening opponent.</i>

34:14.086 --> 34:16.787
So, listen, I need you
to humor me

34:16.789 --> 34:18.955
and follow along
with this story of cobalt.

34:18.957 --> 34:22.125
It used to be owned
by a pair of brits,
dave moulds, sam smith,

34:22.127 --> 34:23.360
<i>  they both recently</i>
<i>  became fathers.</i>

34:23.362 --> 34:25.028
Congratulations, by the way.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.363
That means
they couldn't be here.

34:26.365 --> 34:29.332
<i>  So, what they did</i>
<i>  is they sold cobalt</i>
<i>  to john mladenik.</i>

34:29.334 --> 34:32.002
<i>  He, of course,</i>
<i>  is the captain of gigabyte.</i>

34:32.004 --> 34:33.303
<i> He's got his own robot to run.</i>

34:33.305 --> 34:34.638
So, he called his buddy,
brent rieker,

34:34.640 --> 34:36.039
who used to be
on team gigabyte.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.308
<i>  He said, "sure,</i>
<i>  I'm not gonna drive</i>
<i>  the thing, though".</i>

34:38.310 --> 34:39.776
<i>  So, they got</i>
<i>  their buddy matt maxham.</i>

34:39.778 --> 34:43.246
<i>  He's gonna drive cobalt,</i>
<i>  who's been so excited</i>
<i>  about this robot.</i>

34:43.248 --> 34:46.316
<i>  He's called john mladenik,</i>
<i>  who once again is the captain</i>
<i>  of gigabyte,</i>

34:46.318 --> 34:47.350
and he said, "I'm so excited.

34:47.352 --> 34:49.219
I'm so excited
about this robot."

34:49.221 --> 34:50.887
you probably
don't understand it.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.290
<i>  All you need to know</i>
<i>  is this is one bad bot.</i>

34:53.292 --> 34:55.826
<i> [kenny] yeah, chris,</i>
<i>  cobalt is vicious.</i>

34:55.828 --> 34:58.795
<i>  I still remember it</i>
<i>  ripping the face off of duck!</i>

34:58.797 --> 35:00.297
<i>  A few years ago.</i>

35:00.299 --> 35:03.166
<i>  One way or another,</i>
<i>  the vast majority</i>
<i>  of its fights</i>

35:03.168 --> 35:04.801
<i>  have ended in a knockout.</i>

35:04.803 --> 35:07.170
<i>  It's had a ton of</i>
<i>  international success.</i>

35:07.172 --> 35:11.074
<i>  And many consider this</i>
<i>  to be a top five bot</i>
<i>  in the world.</i>

35:11.076 --> 35:14.144
<i>  With a driver like</i>
<i>  matt maxham at the controls,</i>

35:14.146 --> 35:18.148
<i>  cobalt's saw-like</i>
<i>  vertical spinner</i>
<i>  has horror show potential.</i>

35:18.150 --> 35:19.916
<i>  It's an absolute killer.</i>

35:19.918 --> 35:21.451
<i>  Can't wait to see</i>
<i>  what it does.</i>

35:21.453 --> 35:23.720
It's all coming
your way right now, faruq.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.123
[crowd cheering]

35:28.827 --> 35:33.130
in the red square
from pleasant garden,
north carolina,

35:33.132 --> 35:36.399
he came, he saw, he sawed.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.768
It's cobalt!

35:38.770 --> 35:40.904
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

35:40.906 --> 35:44.975
<i> [chris] the mad man,</i>
<i>  matt maxham,</i>
<i>  pushing in cobalt there,</i>

35:44.977 --> 35:47.310
<i>  making its return</i>
<i>  to battlebots.</i>

35:47.312 --> 35:50.747
<i>  This team, awfully eager</i>
<i>  to get a fight</i>
<i>  under their belt</i>

35:50.749 --> 35:52.315
<i>  with this robot, kenny.</i>

35:52.317 --> 35:55.385
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>
<i>  And they wanna bring</i>
<i>  cobalt back with a bang.</i>

35:55.387 --> 35:57.621
<i>  You can see it</i>
<i>  has that compact design,</i>

35:57.623 --> 36:00.790
<i>  and the vertical spinner</i>
<i>  has some nasty edges.</i>

36:00.792 --> 36:04.628
<i>  And for this fight,</i>
<i>  they've welded</i>
<i>  on a central fork to try</i>

36:04.630 --> 36:09.032
<i>  and jam up fusion's weapons</i>
<i>  that could be</i>
<i>  a difference maker.</i>

36:12.404 --> 36:15.972
In the blue square
from dorchester, wisconsin,

36:15.974 --> 36:20.911
the ambidextrous assassin,
it's fusion!

36:20.913 --> 36:23.213
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

36:27.219 --> 36:31.087
<i> [chris] wow, a lot of</i>
<i>  fusion fans in the house.</i>

36:31.089 --> 36:33.990
<i>  Reese says, he's gunning</i>
<i>  for the giant nut this year.</i>

36:33.992 --> 36:37.994
<i>  But fusion simply</i>
<i>  has to get out</i>
<i>  of its own way, kenny.</i>

36:37.996 --> 36:40.063
<i> [kenny] they think</i>
<i>  they've got</i>
<i>  the flameout's handle,</i>

36:40.065 --> 36:42.699
<i>  but the paranoia</i>
<i>  is still very real.</i>

36:42.701 --> 36:45.001
<i>  I've always said,</i>
<i>  if they can stay alive</i>

36:45.003 --> 36:47.470
<i>  and keep both of those</i>
<i>  primary weapons active,</i>

36:47.472 --> 36:51.074
<i>  this is one of</i>
<i>  the most dangerous bots</i>
<i>  in the game today.</i>

36:51.076 --> 36:56.112
<i> [chris] well, I've got</i>
<i>  a fire extinguisher</i>
<i>  under our desk, just in case.</i>

37:03.121 --> 37:05.488
<i>  We're a little bit cautious</i>
<i>  about this one.</i>

37:05.490 --> 37:07.357
<i>  You can prepare</i>
<i>  for a horizontal spinner</i>

37:07.359 --> 37:09.259
<i>  or you can prepare</i>
<i>  for a vertical spinner.</i>

37:09.261 --> 37:10.293
<i>  But they're both.</i>

37:10.295 --> 37:12.696
<i>  It's harder to prepare</i>
<i>  for somebody that can,</i>

37:12.698 --> 37:14.764
<i>  that can attack you</i>
<i>  in two different ways.</i>

37:14.766 --> 37:16.833
<i>  The strategy is not</i>
<i>  to get caught in the corner.</i>

37:16.835 --> 37:18.935
<i>  If we can keep them</i>
<i>  from getting under us,</i>

37:18.937 --> 37:20.971
<i>  I think</i>
<i>  we can win this fight.</i>

37:20.973 --> 37:25.175
<i>  I am incredibly tired</i>
<i>  of losing for team whyachi.</i>

37:25.177 --> 37:26.977
<i>  Matt is a pretty good driver.</i>

37:26.979 --> 37:27.944
<i>  He's... He's a veteran.</i>

37:27.946 --> 37:31.147
<i> He's been around for 23 years.</i>

37:31.149 --> 37:34.451
<i>  He's currently working</i>
<i>  on a contraption</i>
<i>  in the welding tent to try</i>

37:34.453 --> 37:36.086
<i>  and beat my horizontal.</i>

37:36.088 --> 37:38.822
<i>  He leaves me no option</i>
<i>  but to go at him</i>
<i>  with the vert,</i>

37:38.824 --> 37:41.224
<i>  get him flipped over</i>
<i>  and then tailwhip him</i>

37:41.226 --> 37:44.160
<i>  with my... My horizontal</i>
<i>  and rip into him.</i>

<i> [chris] listen to this crowd,</i>
<i>  they are ready for a brawl.</i>

38:04.049 --> 38:07.217
<i>  Will reese ewert</i>
<i>  add another chapter</i>
<i>  to the storied history</i>

38:07.219 --> 38:08.918
<i>  of the whyachi clan?</i>

38:08.920 --> 38:12.989
<i>  Or will cobalt throw</i>
<i>  the book in a blender?</i>

38:12.991 --> 38:17.994
<i>  The fight</i>
<i>  when battlebots continues.</i>

38:25.771 --> 38:29.205
<i> [chris] we are right back</i>
<i>  into the action here</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

38:29.207 --> 38:33.977
<i>  Fusion and cobalt</i>

<i> [kenny] yeah, chris,</i>
<i>  I don't think these two</i>
<i>  smile in family photos.</i>

<i>  The weapon to weapon hit.</i>
<i>  Oh, fusion by fusion.</i>

39:46.451 --> 39:49.619
<i> [kenny] oh, gosh,</i>
<i>  does cobalt wants a war?</i>

39:49.621 --> 39:51.421
<i> [chris] yes, it does.</i>

39:51.423 --> 39:53.590
<i> [kenny] matt maxham</i>
<i>  is just throwing cobalt</i>

<i>  into that vertical spinner</i>
<i>  on fusion, chris.</i>

39:56.194 --> 40:00.130
<i>  So far,</i>
<i>  it's cobalt getting</i>

40:00.132 --> 40:02.932
<i> [chris] another big shot</i>
<i>  delivered by reese ewert,</i>

40:02.934 --> 40:05.201
<i>  whose bot has yet</i>
<i>  to catch on fire, kenny.</i>

40:05.203 --> 40:08.338
<i>  I call that</i>
<i>  a massive progress.</i>

<i> -[kenny] whoa!</i>
<i> -[chris] whoa!</i>

40:10.308 --> 40:13.209
<i> Uh-oh! But how long can fusion</i>
<i>  keep this up?</i>

<i>  I guess there's your answer.</i>

40:17.048 --> 40:18.281
<i>  Geez!</i>

<i>  I keep waiting for fusion</i>

<i>  but it is looking rock</i>
<i>  solid here, kenny.</i>

40:23.488 --> 40:24.554
<i>  Wow!</i>

40:24.556 --> 40:27.857
<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

41:12.671 --> 41:18.107
<i>  runs both of fusion's weapons</i>
<i>  for the entire match</i>
<i>  and absolutely dominates.</i>

41:18.109 --> 41:20.877
<i> [kenny] seems like</i>
<i>  they got it all</i>
<i>  figured out this season.</i>

41:20.879 --> 41:23.112
<i>  My goodness, that thing</i>
<i>  was hitting so hard.</i>

41:23.114 --> 41:24.214
<i>  Look at that.</i>

41:24.216 --> 41:26.149
<i> [chris] and, kenny,</i>
<i>  on the flip side of things,</i>

41:26.151 --> 41:30.019
<i>  matt maxham seemed determined</i>
<i> to send cobalt right at fusion</i>

41:30.021 --> 41:31.821
<i>  and settle things</i>
<i>  weapon to weapon.</i>

41:31.823 --> 41:34.090
<i>  Do you think</i>
<i>  that was a good strategy?</i>

41:34.092 --> 41:36.726
<i> [kenny] well, no,</i>
<i>  not after those</i>
<i>  first few impacts.</i>

41:36.728 --> 41:40.129
<i>  I actually think</i>
<i>  the extension they added</i>
<i>  to cobalt's front wedge,</i>

41:40.131 --> 41:42.932
<i>  prevented it</i>
<i>  from winning those exchanges,</i>

41:42.934 --> 41:47.670
<i>  but matt kept</i>
<i>  on mashing the controls</i>
<i>  and begging for more contact.</i>

41:47.672 --> 41:50.139
<i>  Be careful what you wish</i>
<i>  for, I guess.</i>

41:52.310 --> 41:55.378
<i> [chris] hey, yeah, reese,</i>
<i>  bring the whole clan in,</i>
<i>  why not?</i>

41:55.380 --> 41:58.515
That's the way fusion
is supposed to work, right?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.250
That's how
it's supposed to work.

42:00.252 --> 42:02.852
I think we got that
confusion figured out.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.320
[kenny and chris laughing]

42:04.322 --> 42:06.956
he said that,
it wasn't me, I swear.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.458
That was kenny,
by the way that said it.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.026
I'll hold that
against you for quite a while.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.227
Yeah, exactly.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.896
Well, you got it
all figured out, man.

42:12.898 --> 42:15.164
That thing was hitting
and hitting hard.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.099
And guess what?

42:16.101 --> 42:17.133
You didn't burn up.

42:17.135 --> 42:19.936
That's right.
That's the best thing, uh.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.171
That's all you can ask for,
really, it's not burning up.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.041
You seem calm,
cool and collected.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.143
Were you this confident
heading into this fight?

42:28.079 --> 42:29.646
Eh...

42:31.116 --> 42:34.384
I've seen some fires
testing at home
before we came here,

42:34.386 --> 42:39.255
but I did some tuning on it
and I was the most confident
I've ever been in that.

42:39.257 --> 42:40.256
-So.
<i> -[chris] wow.</i>

42:40.258 --> 42:42.892
Hey, reese,
through one fight this season,

42:42.894 --> 42:45.128
you have a better record
than your older brother.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.829
-What's that mean to you?
-That's right.

42:46.831 --> 42:50.133
Yeah, I'd like to welcome
jake back
<i> to battlebots this year.</i>

42:51.403 --> 42:53.603
I think he deserves an award.

42:53.605 --> 42:58.808
Um, you know,
being the most hated man
on television at a time

42:58.810 --> 43:01.077
when donald trump
was on television.

43:03.281 --> 43:06.416
All right, reese,
those improv classes you took

43:06.418 --> 43:08.418
during the off season
are really paying off.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.886
-Thank you.
-All right, dude.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.155
Congratulations.
Job well done.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.992
[kenny laughs]
<i>  he's so good.</i>

43:15.994 --> 43:17.627
[crowd cheering]

43:20.031 --> 43:22.732
<i> [chris] all right,</i>
<i>  we started off this fight</i>
<i>  kind of poking fun</i>

43:22.734 --> 43:25.001
<i>  at resee ewert and fusion,</i>
<i>  by the way,</i>

43:25.003 --> 43:26.936
that was you that
he was upset with, not me.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.371
I almost forgot.

43:28.373 --> 43:31.140
Yeah, but it was nice
to not see the bot
catch on fire

43:31.142 --> 43:33.643
<i>  and to do</i>
<i>  what it was supposed to do.</i>

43:33.645 --> 43:36.112
<i> [kenny] that's right. Listen,</i>
<i>  they had high hopes</i>
<i>  for it last season.</i>

43:36.114 --> 43:38.348
<i>  They were hoping</i>
<i>  that it would do just that.</i>

43:38.350 --> 43:41.017
<i>  Um, but again,</i>
<i>  when you're bringing</i>
<i>  in new technology,</i>

43:41.019 --> 43:42.118
<i>  it could take</i>
<i>  a little bit of time.</i>

43:42.120 --> 43:44.420
<i>  It's all coming together</i>
<i>  right now for them.</i>

43:44.422 --> 43:47.790
All right. So, are you
backpedaling a little bit?
Are you trying to step off

43:47.792 --> 43:48.992
what you were saying earlier?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.660
I'm on team fusion now.
No, no confusion.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.295
I'm on, I'm on team fusion.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.163
You just want
some of the proceeds
from the t-shirt sales.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.032
That's all.

43:56.034 --> 43:59.769
<i>  Coming up next,</i>
<i>  will black dragon</i>
<i>  be too hot to handle</i>

43:59.771 --> 44:03.906
<i>  or will icewave</i>
<i>  be too cold to hold?</i>

44:03.908 --> 44:06.943
<i>  And later tonight</i>
<i>  in our monster main event,</i>

44:06.945 --> 44:10.380
<i>  copperhead</i>
<i>  will collide with lock-jaw.</i>

44:12.050 --> 44:14.050
<i>  There's captain donald hutson</i>
<i>  and--</i>

44:14.052 --> 44:17.320
<i>  oh, hey,</i>
<i>  get a little snake bite.</i>

44:17.322 --> 44:20.790
<i>  Donald's doing</i>
<i>  all the foreshadowing for us</i>
<i>  as he gears up for his bout</i>

44:20.792 --> 44:23.526
<i>  with last season's number</i>
<i>  three overall seed.</i>

44:23.528 --> 44:29.465
<i>  The sparks keep flying</i>
<i>  when we return on battlebots.</i>

44:38.410 --> 44:43.312
<i> We are back on battlebots</i>
<i> and up next, we welcome back</i>
<i> one of the four semi-finalists</i>

44:43.314 --> 44:47.950
from the 2020 season,
black dragon,
now captained by gabriel maia.

44:47.952 --> 44:49.585
<i>  How tough is this robot?</i>

44:49.587 --> 44:51.287
<i>  Last season</i>
<i>  in one of its fights,</i>

44:51.289 --> 44:55.024
<i> it was on fire for two minutes</i>
<i>  and won the match.</i>

44:55.026 --> 44:55.892
<i> [announcer] black dragon.</i>

44:55.894 --> 44:58.261
<i> [chris] that is one nasty bot.</i>

44:58.263 --> 45:01.030
<i> [kenny] and, chris, we saw</i>
<i>  their fellow countrymen,</i>
<i>  minotaur,</i>

45:01.032 --> 45:03.466
<i>  survive an inferno</i>
<i>  on opening night.</i>

45:03.468 --> 45:05.201
<i>  There's something</i>
<i>  in the water in brazil.</i>

45:05.203 --> 45:07.970
<i>  They're building bots</i>
<i>  as durable as they come.</i>

45:07.972 --> 45:11.708
Uh, it's been a while
since we've seen icewave
in full-time competition.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.844
Last year, they participated
just as a bounty finalist.

45:14.846 --> 45:19.615
<i>  So, marc devidts,</i>
<i>  welcome back</i>
<i> for the first time since 2018.</i>

45:19.617 --> 45:22.118
<i>  Kenny, some might call</i>
<i>  icewave past its prime.</i>

45:22.120 --> 45:23.953
<i>  I ain't one of them.</i>

45:23.955 --> 45:26.823
<i>  No one looks forward</i>
<i>  to fighting this robot.</i>

45:26.825 --> 45:28.791
<i> [kenny] it can</i>
<i>  still chop through concrete.</i>

45:28.793 --> 45:31.127
<i>  So yeah,</i>
<i> I'd be a little hesitant, too.</i>

45:31.129 --> 45:34.297
<i>  Listen, this bot</i>
<i>  is from another era</i>
<i>  and in many respects,</i>

45:34.299 --> 45:36.566
<i>  the sport has</i>
<i>  technologically caught up</i>

45:36.568 --> 45:38.167
<i>  and even flown</i>
<i>  right past them,</i>

45:38.169 --> 45:41.270
<i>  but just like any legend</i>
<i>  in the twilight</i>
<i>  of their career,</i>

45:41.272 --> 45:45.541
<i>  ice wave has a wealth</i>
<i>  of experience</i>
<i>  on its side to its credit,</i>

45:45.543 --> 45:48.878
<i>  mark has rebuilt icewave</i>
<i>  from the ground up</i>

45:48.880 --> 45:54.884
<i> and the dude's a robot wizard,</i>
<i>  so I am not sleeping</i>
<i>  on this bot.</i>

45:54.886 --> 45:56.953
Let's send it over to faruq.

45:56.955 --> 45:59.055
[crowd cheering]

46:00.291 --> 46:05.862
in the red square,
this bot is a brazilian
sporting legend like pele.

46:05.864 --> 46:09.799
He's always down
for the rumble,
always up for the melee.

46:09.801 --> 46:12.401
He gets a kick out
of torturing you

46:12.403 --> 46:17.340
and taking your soul
and winning the giant nut
is his only team's

46:17.342 --> 46:21.310
goal!

46:21.312 --> 46:24.180
It's black dragon!

46:24.182 --> 46:25.381
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

46:25.383 --> 46:26.916
<i> [chris] oh, yeah.</i>

46:26.918 --> 46:31.721
<i>  You hear the crowd,</i>
<i>  black dragon won over</i>
<i>  a lot of fans last season</i>

46:31.723 --> 46:34.857
<i>  with that unforgettable</i>
<i>  quarterfinal win over ribbot</i>

46:34.859 --> 46:39.028
<i>  and now a brand-new captain</i>
<i>  is soaking it all in.</i>

46:39.030 --> 46:41.764
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  gabriel maia now at the helm</i>

46:41.766 --> 46:44.767
<i>  and he's got his eyes</i>
<i>  on the finals this season.</i>

46:44.769 --> 46:48.171
<i>  Black dragon has</i>
<i>  a ton of wedge combinations</i>
<i>  and of course,</i>

46:48.173 --> 46:51.107
<i>  that heavy egg beater</i>
<i>  drum.</i>

46:55.847 --> 47:02.251
In the blue square,
facing off with this bot,
that's the path you've chosen?

47:02.253 --> 47:05.855
This thing's so cold,
it's practically frozen.

47:05.857 --> 47:09.192
But there's no anna
or elsa or olaf on this show

47:09.194 --> 47:15.264
when he holds your life
in his hands
and decides to let it go.

47:15.266 --> 47:18.634
Give it up for icewave!

47:18.636 --> 47:20.436
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

47:23.975 --> 47:29.045
<i> [chris] marc devidts,</i>
<i>  ah, carrying his</i>
<i>  little daughter with him.</i>

47:29.047 --> 47:31.113
<i>  Truly a family affair.</i>

47:31.115 --> 47:36.085
<i>  Kenny, icewave is like a car,</i>
<i>  like same car,</i>
<i>  but newer model.</i>

47:36.087 --> 47:37.587
<i>  This thing looks pretty cool.</i>

47:37.589 --> 47:39.722
<i> [kenny] no doubt, very slick.</i>

47:39.724 --> 47:42.992
<i>  Looks brand new,</i>
<i>  but there's a couple</i>
<i>  of familiar things</i>

47:42.994 --> 47:47.864
<i>  that deadly 54-pound blade</i>
<i>  that spins 200 miles an hour</i>

47:47.866 --> 47:51.234
<i>  and icewave still roars.</i>

47:56.875 --> 47:59.609
<i>  It's a pleasure</i>
<i>  to face icewave.</i>

47:59.611 --> 48:04.447
<i> Uh, as you said, it's a legend</i>
<i>  and one of the most</i>
<i>  destructive ones ever.</i>

48:04.449 --> 48:06.115
<i>  I will run after icewave.</i>

48:06.117 --> 48:08.651
<i>  I'll go search for him.</i>

48:08.653 --> 48:14.090
<i>  I'll not let them, uh,</i>
<i>  accelerate, spin up the bar,</i>
<i>  so I'll keep pushing</i>

48:14.092 --> 48:18.694
<i>  and I'll try to get</i>
<i>  the center of the arena</i>
<i> so I don't get into surprises.</i>

48:18.696 --> 48:20.663
<i>  It's a little intimidating,</i>
<i>  coming in,</i>

48:20.665 --> 48:24.166
<i>  having not fought</i>
<i>  for a few years</i>
<i>  in the full tournament,</i>

48:24.168 --> 48:28.004
<i>  then getting thrown up</i>
<i>  against one of</i>
<i> the best teams from last year.</i>

48:28.006 --> 48:31.240
<i>  I'm worried about</i>
<i>  a head-to-head hit</i>
<i> with their weapon against ours</i>

48:31.242 --> 48:32.742
<i>  because I think</i>
<i>  ours won't fare so well.</i>

48:32.744 --> 48:34.076
<i>  Theirs is really thick.</i>

48:34.078 --> 48:36.445
<i>  That's going to start</i>
<i>  chipping pieces off</i>
<i>  of our blade.</i>

48:36.447 --> 48:39.048
<i>  But if we can hit</i>
<i>  anywhere else,</i>
<i>  I think we'll be good.</i>

48:42.253 --> 48:44.453
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

48:45.990 --> 48:49.725
<i> [chris] black dragon looking</i>
<i>  menacing inside the box</i>

48:49.727 --> 48:54.196
<i>  and now they've got a chance</i>
<i>  to shut down an icon</i>
<i>  in icewave.</i>

48:54.198 --> 48:58.134
<i>  For more on icewave,</i>
<i>  let's check in</i>
<i>  with former editor,</i>

48:58.136 --> 49:00.603
<i>  current analyst</i>
<i>  and forever genius,</i>

49:00.605 --> 49:03.039
<i>  the bot whisperer,</i>
<i>  pete abrahamson.</i>

49:03.041 --> 49:05.174
<i>  All right, pete, tell us</i>
<i>  what separates icewave</i>

49:05.176 --> 49:07.443
<i>  from the other robots</i>
<i>  out there?</i>

49:08.246 --> 49:10.980
Well, the biggest deal
is hidden underneath that box.

49:10.982 --> 49:13.316
What's under there is
an internal combustion engine

49:13.318 --> 49:15.384
<i>  taken out of</i>
<i>  an emergency rescue zone.</i>

49:15.386 --> 49:19.956
Now, a few seasons back,
they were using
the actual whole saw

49:19.958 --> 49:21.824
<i>  and all pieces to it.</i>

49:21.826 --> 49:24.226
<i>  Now, what they've done,</i>
<i>  over the years</i>
<i>  as it's evolved,</i>

49:24.228 --> 49:27.730
and the only thing left
is this cylinder head.

49:27.732 --> 49:31.000
All the rest of this
has been
completely re-machined

49:31.002 --> 49:33.903
and redesigned to be
a far more efficient,

49:33.905 --> 49:37.206
easier to start,
more reliable, icewave.

49:37.208 --> 49:38.140
<i> [chris] thank you, pete.</i>

49:38.142 --> 49:39.875
<i>  So that's what's</i>
<i>  under the hood.</i>

49:39.877 --> 49:43.179
<i>  And kenny, I love</i>
<i>  hearing the sound</i>
<i>  that this thing makes</i>

49:43.181 --> 49:44.547
<i>  when it starts cranking up.</i>

49:44.949 --> 49:47.383
<i> [kenny] yeah, it is</i>
<i>  a very intimidating sound,</i>
<i>  for sure.</i>

49:47.385 --> 49:49.285
[man 1] all right, here we go.

49:50.188 --> 49:52.955
[automated voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

49:52.957 --> 49:55.758
<i> [chris] all right, nice moves</i>
<i>  from the brazilians.</i>

49:55.760 --> 49:57.460
<i>  This team's already</i>
<i>  in the groove.</i>

49:57.462 --> 50:00.296
[automated voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

50:01.265 --> 50:02.965
[crowd cheering]

50:16.247 --> 50:18.581
[crowd cheering]

50:24.022 --> 50:26.155
[crowd cheering]

50:29.060 --> 50:31.160
[chris]
<i>  let the bot battle begin.</i>

50:31.162 --> 50:35.031
<i>  And here's the black dragon</i>
<i>  delivering his shot</i>
<i>  to icewave.</i>

50:35.033 --> 50:39.001
<i> [kenny] what a dangerous start</i>
<i>  to this fight.</i>
<i>  My goodness.</i>

50:39.003 --> 50:43.806
<i>  Black dragon</i>
<i>  smothering icewave now,</i>
<i>  taking it for a ride.</i>

50:43.808 --> 50:45.441
<i>  Wow!</i>

50:45.443 --> 50:49.211
<i>  And this is big time trouble</i>
<i>  for mark devidts's icewave.</i>

50:49.213 --> 50:54.283
<i>  Its engine is roaring, kenny,</i>
<i>  and there is no action,</i>
<i>  whatsoever from that blade.</i>

50:54.285 --> 50:55.918
[woman 2]
our parts are rippin'.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.953
[man] the chain or belt
or something.

50:57.955 --> 51:01.624
<i> [kenny] yeah, I think</i>
<i>  black dragon may have</i>
<i>  knocked icewave's weapon</i>

51:01.626 --> 51:04.627
<i>  out of commission</i>
<i> in that first exchange, chris.</i>

51:04.629 --> 51:07.263
<i>  And the brazilians</i>
<i>  are not backing down.</i>

51:07.265 --> 51:09.865
<i>  They want to finish the job.</i>

51:09.867 --> 51:14.403
<i> [chris] nice putt there as</i>
<i>  black dragon drives icewave</i>
<i>  into the short corner.</i>

51:14.405 --> 51:16.839
<i>  Can mark devidts</i>
<i>  find a way to turn the tide?</i>

51:16.841 --> 51:17.973
<i>  Oh!</i>

51:18.042 --> 51:21.210
<i> Another shot from black dragon</i>
<i>  and now the pulverizer</i>

51:21.212 --> 51:24.613
<i>  adding insult</i>
<i>  to injury as well.</i>

51:24.615 --> 51:26.515
[kenny]
<i>  icewave is drowning, chris.</i>

51:26.517 --> 51:28.484
<i> [referee] ten, nine...</i>

51:28.486 --> 51:31.120
<i> [chris] the referees agree,</i>
<i>  and the countdown</i>
<i>  has officially started.</i>

51:31.122 --> 51:33.255
[referee] ...Six, five.

51:33.257 --> 51:35.124
<i> [chris] yeah,</i>
<i>  their primary weapon</i>
<i>  has been shut down</i>

51:35.126 --> 51:37.860
<i>  and the robot</i>
<i>  has been shut out.</i>

51:37.862 --> 51:39.562
[referee] ...One!
That's a knock out!

51:39.564 --> 51:41.230
[crowd cheering]

51:41.232 --> 51:46.469
[chris] black dragon,
fast out of the gate
here in 2021.

51:50.942 --> 51:53.709
<i>  Kenny, when a box rush</i>
<i>  goes your direction, man,</i>

51:53.711 --> 51:55.411
<i> it can totally change a fight.</i>

51:55.646 --> 52:00.082
<i> [kenny] yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>  Black dragon wasted no time</i>
<i>  going right at icewave</i>

52:00.084 --> 52:03.018
<i>  and they just never let up</i>
<i> getting underneath them there,</i>

52:03.020 --> 52:05.354
<i>  take 'em for a ride</i>
<i>  around the battlebox,</i>

52:05.356 --> 52:06.622
<i>  getting them</i>
<i>  to slam into walls</i>

52:06.624 --> 52:09.792
<i>  and it was pretty much</i>
<i>  all black dragon here.</i>

52:09.794 --> 52:12.161
<i> [chris] well, icewave's blade</i>
<i>  huffed and it puffed,</i>

52:12.163 --> 52:14.930
<i>  but it just</i>
<i>  wouldn't start up again.</i>

52:14.932 --> 52:18.300
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  black dragon basically</i>
<i>  broke icewave's arms</i>

52:18.302 --> 52:22.138
<i>  in the first 10 seconds</i>
<i>  of a would be fist fight,</i>

52:22.140 --> 52:23.906
<i>  then left it huddled</i>
<i>  in the corner.</i>

52:23.908 --> 52:25.841
<i>  Brutal.</i>

52:25.843 --> 52:29.145
<i> [chris] and there's</i>
<i>  the pulverizer</i>
<i>  exclamation point</i>

52:29.147 --> 52:33.048
<i>  on a dominant performance</i>
<i>  by the brazilians.</i>

52:33.050 --> 52:35.184
[crowd cheering]

52:35.186 --> 52:37.520
thank you guys.
Thank you. Thank you.

52:41.125 --> 52:44.093
Well, kenny,
that is a statement
by a semi-finalist

52:44.095 --> 52:46.028
from the 2020 season.

52:46.030 --> 52:48.864
<i>  This black dragon squad</i>
<i>  is a lot of fun to watch.</i>

52:48.866 --> 52:50.399
<i>  The crowd loves them.</i>

52:50.401 --> 52:53.202
<i>  They got cool dance moves</i>
<i>  and they just said,</i>

52:53.204 --> 52:56.839
<i>  "sorry to spoil</i>
<i>  your big-time return,</i>
<i>  icewave, but remember us?</i>

52:56.841 --> 52:58.240
<i>  We're back!"</i>

52:58.242 --> 52:59.341
<i> [kenny] and for icewave.</i>

52:59.343 --> 53:00.809
<i>  You took your licks.</i>

53:00.811 --> 53:03.279
<i>  Now,</i>
<i>  it's all about bouncing back.</i>

53:04.615 --> 53:07.283
<i> [chris] coming up,</i>
<i>  the quack is back.</i>

53:08.286 --> 53:11.220
<i>  Hal rucker and duck!</i>
<i>  Return to the box</i>

53:11.222 --> 53:14.223
<i>  for a matchup</i>
<i>  with 2019 runner up,</i>

53:14.225 --> 53:16.425
<i>  witch doctor.</i>

53:16.427 --> 53:19.128
<i> That's next on battlebots.</i>

53:27.071 --> 53:28.070
<i> We are back on battlebots</i>

53:28.072 --> 53:31.240
and we've got
a spicy one for you.

53:31.242 --> 53:35.744
<i>  Kenny, let's start</i>
<i>  with witch doctor</i>
<i>  and andrea and mike gellatly.</i>

53:35.746 --> 53:38.981
<i>  They admitted that</i>
<i>  after they finished runner up</i>
<i>  in 2019,</i>

53:38.983 --> 53:40.516
<i> they were feeling the pressure</i>
<i>  in 2020</i>

53:40.518 --> 53:43.819
<i>  and it kind of showed.</i>
<i>  One in two</i>
<i>  during the regular season</i>

53:43.821 --> 53:46.855
<i>  worked their way</i>
<i>  into the round of 32</i>
<i>  where they won a match,</i>

53:46.857 --> 53:49.191
<i>  but they bowed out</i>
<i>  in the round of 16.</i>

53:49.193 --> 53:52.061
<i>  They said, this year,</i>
<i>  nobody's gunning for us.</i>

53:52.063 --> 53:54.163
I ain't buying that, kenny,
are you?

53:54.165 --> 53:56.232
Neither am I.
They're a legendary team.

53:56.234 --> 53:58.000
They've been around
for a long time.

53:58.002 --> 54:01.036
<i>  They're very well respected.</i>
<i>  They are always dangerous.</i>

54:01.038 --> 54:04.006
<i>  And listen, despite being</i>
<i>  an old school bot,</i>

54:04.008 --> 54:06.742
<i>  witch doctor has adapted</i>
<i>  and evolved with the sport</i>

54:06.744 --> 54:09.311
<i>  and the results speak</i>
<i>  for themselves.</i>

54:09.313 --> 54:13.916
<i>  They were a title favorite</i>
<i>  and every team will keep</i>
<i>  a close eye on them.</i>

54:13.918 --> 54:15.251
[quacking sound]

54:15.253 --> 54:18.687
<i> [chris] and that</i>
<i>  includes duck!</i>
<i>  Engineered by hal rucker.</i>

54:18.689 --> 54:22.057
<i>  He's looking to shake off</i>
<i>  the ring rust</i>
<i>  and as he told us,</i>

54:22.059 --> 54:24.994
<i>  he's not sure</i>
<i>  if a defensive-minded bot</i>
<i>  can keep pace</i>

54:24.996 --> 54:27.730
<i>  with this year's</i>
<i>  deadly line-up.</i>

54:27.732 --> 54:30.032
I'll tell you what,
if I'm facing a bump
like witch doctor,

54:30.034 --> 54:32.134
I want to be
very defensively sound.

54:32.136 --> 54:33.669
<i>  That's what hal rucker</i>
<i>  and duck!</i>

54:33.671 --> 54:38.140
<i>  Are all about is don't die,</i>
<i>  survive, be more durable.</i>

54:38.142 --> 54:41.277
<i>  And as you can see,</i>
<i>  they've got the new</i>
<i>  duck! Bill lifter.</i>

54:41.279 --> 54:44.380
<i>  Hal wants to control</i>
<i> this fight and use the lifter,</i>

54:44.382 --> 54:46.649
<i>  both to mitigate</i>
<i>  heavy weapon shots</i>

54:46.651 --> 54:49.084
<i>  and to hopefully,</i>
<i>  put witch doctor</i>

54:49.086 --> 54:52.187
<i>  in some precarious spots</i>
<i>  inside the box.</i>

54:52.189 --> 54:54.156
[chris]
<i>  it's going to be a battle.</i>

54:55.059 --> 54:56.625
Faruq, take it away.

54:58.262 --> 55:00.062
[faruq] in the red square.

55:00.064 --> 55:03.966
It wasn't dr. Kevorkian
and it wasn't dr. Seuss.

55:03.968 --> 55:08.003
When you ask me
who the killer is,
you have to tell the truth.

55:08.005 --> 55:11.974
It wasn't dr. Zhivago
or dr. Frasier crane

55:11.976 --> 55:16.111
when they ask,
"witch doctor killed you?"

55:16.113 --> 55:18.614
say, yep, mm-hmm.

55:18.616 --> 55:22.785
That's the name,
it's witch doctor!

55:22.787 --> 55:24.653
[crowd cheering]

55:29.393 --> 55:34.797
<i> [chris] oh, a standing ovation</i>
<i>  for the 2019 runner up</i>

55:34.799 --> 55:38.233
<i>  andera and mike gellatly</i>
<i>  and team witch doctor.</i>

55:38.235 --> 55:40.202
<i>  The people still love them.</i>

55:40.204 --> 55:44.340
<i>  And, kenny, it's hard</i>
<i>  not to expect big things</i>
<i>  from this robot.</i>

55:44.342 --> 55:47.876
<i>  They are always</i>
<i>  in final boss mode.</i>

55:47.878 --> 55:49.878
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  even last season,</i>

55:49.880 --> 55:54.450
<i>  they followed</i>
<i>  an early tournament exit up</i>
<i> with a spectacular bounty win.</i>

55:54.452 --> 55:57.119
<i>  This team</i>
<i>  is unrelentingly aggressive</i>

55:57.121 --> 55:59.922
<i>  and mike's one of</i>
<i>  the best drivers</i>
<i>  in this sport.</i>

55:59.924 --> 56:02.157
[faruq] in the blue square,

56:02.159 --> 56:04.893
brace yourself, y'all,
it's about to get spooky.

56:04.895 --> 56:08.797
This thing is a murderer,
something straight
out of a movie.

56:08.799 --> 56:12.835
Imagine a scene,
you wake up in a dark room,
mouth taped shut.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.937
You can feel
the impending doom.

56:14.939 --> 56:16.672
Suddenly,
the killer's behind you.

56:16.674 --> 56:18.173
You feel his breath
on your back

56:18.175 --> 56:24.313
and you know your day
when you hear the... Quack.

56:24.315 --> 56:27.716
Give it up for duck!.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.418
[crowd cheering]

56:31.355 --> 56:33.956
<i> [chris] duck!,</i>
<i>  a fan favorite as well,</i>

56:33.958 --> 56:38.127
<i>  participating</i>
<i>  for the first time</i>
<i>  since the 2019 season.</i>

56:39.130 --> 56:40.629
<i>  Listen to the crowd.</i>

56:41.766 --> 56:44.900
<i> [kenny] and look</i>
<i>  at those forks on duck!.</i>

56:44.902 --> 56:47.970
<i>  Chris, we know</i>
<i>  we won't get</i>
<i>  a lot of offense out of duck!</i>

56:47.972 --> 56:51.974
<i>  But hal is a master of,</i>
<i>  what I call, the ugly fight.</i>

56:51.976 --> 56:56.044
<i>  He wants to take</i>
<i>  witch doctor's best shots</i>
<i>  like he's rocky balboa</i>

56:56.046 --> 56:59.648
<i>  and score enough points</i>
<i>  with the judges</i>
<i>  to steal a victory.</i>

57:01.919 --> 57:03.619
<i>  Uh, we've made</i>
<i>  some pretty big changes</i>

57:03.621 --> 57:04.887
<i>  to our weapons system</i>
<i>  this year.</i>

57:04.889 --> 57:06.889
<i>  We switched</i>
<i>  to a different material,</i>

57:06.891 --> 57:10.092
<i>  uh, for the discs,</i>
<i>  to get away from the issue</i>
<i>  we had last year,</i>

57:10.094 --> 57:12.428
<i>  we've made some changes</i>
<i>  to the weapon motors,</i>

57:12.430 --> 57:13.762
<i>  so we'll have to see</i>
<i>  if that's reliable.</i>

57:13.764 --> 57:15.731
<i>  So, this is going to be</i>
<i>  a really big test.</i>

57:15.733 --> 57:17.733
<i>  And really important for us</i>
<i>  to win this first match.</i>

57:17.735 --> 57:20.636
<i>  We noticed that</i>
<i>  they have some really,</i>
<i> really big forks on the robot.</i>

57:20.638 --> 57:22.137
<i>  We're not going to be able</i>
<i>  to outfork them,</i>

57:22.139 --> 57:25.007
<i>  so, we've actually decided</i>
<i>  not to use</i>
<i>  the ground scraping forks.</i>

57:25.009 --> 57:27.543
<i>  And we're going to use</i>
<i>  maneuverability</i>
<i>  to our advantage.</i>

57:27.545 --> 57:29.311
<i>  Hopefully, they're not used</i>
<i>  to driving with their forks</i>

57:29.313 --> 57:32.314
<i>  and they get a little bit</i>
<i>  hung up and that's just</i>
<i>  the opening we need.</i>

57:32.316 --> 57:35.250
<i>  This year's version of</i>
<i>  duck! Is completely new.</i>

57:35.252 --> 57:38.754
<i>  Uh, it's 100 percent</i>
<i>  brushless motors.</i>

57:38.756 --> 57:41.089
<i>  Uh, we got rid of the plow</i>
<i>  that we had last year</i>

57:41.091 --> 57:45.227
<i>  and we now have a lifter</i>
<i>  that works like</i>
<i>  a real duckbill.</i>

57:45.229 --> 57:47.996
<i>  In previous seasons,</i>
<i>  we've been known as the robot</i>
<i>  that's hard to kill.</i>

57:47.998 --> 57:49.298
<i>  We just keep going.</i>

57:49.300 --> 57:51.433
<i>  We've had</i>
<i>  our weapon ripped off</i>

57:51.435 --> 57:54.837
<i>  and eventually, won the match</i>
<i>  because we just endured.</i>

57:54.839 --> 57:56.171
<i>  We've kept that durability.</i>

57:56.173 --> 57:57.473
<i>  That's our main feature.</i>

57:57.475 --> 57:58.907
<i>  We're hard to kill.</i>

57:58.909 --> 58:00.275
<i>  I think we might have a shot.</i>

58:01.445 --> 58:03.178
[crowd cheering]

58:06.317 --> 58:08.350
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

58:28.272 --> 58:30.606
[crowd cheering]

58:30.608 --> 58:32.941
[chris]
<i>  the immovable object, duck!</i>

58:32.943 --> 58:35.344
<i>  The unstoppable force,</i>
<i>  witch doctor,</i>

58:35.346 --> 58:37.546
<i>  here we go.</i>

58:39.850 --> 58:41.884
<i>  Let the bot battle begin!</i>

58:41.886 --> 58:44.486
<i>  Nice and easy,</i>
<i>  out of the squares,</i>

58:44.488 --> 58:47.055
<i>  witch doctor's weapon up</i>
<i>  to full speed.</i>

58:47.057 --> 58:48.023
<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

58:48.025 --> 58:49.758
<i> [chris] oh, witch</i>
<i>  doctor lands a shot,</i>

58:49.760 --> 58:52.995
<i>  it rips the fork clean off</i>
<i>  of duck!</i>
<i>  That was impressive.</i>

58:52.997 --> 58:55.764
<i> [kenny] that was</i>
<i>  a beautiful hit there</i>
<i>  by witch doctor.</i>

58:55.766 --> 58:58.367
<i>  It's trying to go after</i>
<i>  the other one, chris.</i>

58:58.369 --> 59:03.038
<i> [chris] witch doctor scores</i>
<i>  some serious damage points</i>
<i>  and there's another shot.</i>

59:03.040 --> 59:05.007
[kenny]
<i>  mike gellatly all over duck!</i>

59:05.009 --> 59:06.975
<i>  Here in the early going.</i>

59:06.977 --> 59:10.178
<i> [chris] nothing like</i>
<i>  a delicious appetizer</i>
<i>  of duck! Tires.</i>

59:10.180 --> 59:11.780
[crowd gasping]
<i>  oh.</i>

59:11.782 --> 59:14.449
<i>  Witch doctor punches</i>
<i>  duck! Across the box.</i>

59:14.451 --> 59:17.686
<i>  And there's hal rucker</i>
<i>  with a counter shot</i>
<i>  straight to the weapon</i>

59:17.688 --> 59:19.855
<i>  of witch doctor.</i>

59:19.857 --> 59:23.025
<i> [kenny] in seasons past,</i>
<i>  we've referred</i>
<i>  to duck!'s strategy</i>

59:23.027 --> 59:25.761
<i>  as "break your fist</i>
<i>  with my face,"</i>

59:25.763 --> 59:28.764
<i>  and that's hal rucker's path</i>
<i>  to success here again.</i>

59:28.766 --> 59:31.066
<i>  He just wants</i>
<i>  to dirty up this fight.</i>

59:32.102 --> 59:34.069
<i> [chris] and speak</i>
<i>  of the devil, kenny,</i>

59:34.071 --> 59:36.171
<i>  it looks like witch doctor's</i>
<i>  primary weapon</i>

59:36.173 --> 59:39.875
<i>  is creeping to a stop.</i>
<i>  Has duck! Done it?</i>

59:39.877 --> 59:41.577
<i> [kenny] it looks like</i>
<i>  it may have,</i>

59:41.579 --> 59:44.646
<i>  and that is bad news</i>
<i>  for witch doctor, chris.</i>

59:44.648 --> 59:48.116
<i>  This is exactly what</i>
<i>  hal rucker was looking for.</i>

59:48.118 --> 59:49.985
<i> [chris] okay, so a minute</i>
<i>  into this fight</i>

59:49.987 --> 59:52.854
<i>  and duck! Has flipped</i>
<i>  the script here.</i>

59:52.856 --> 59:55.190
<i>  It can now go to work</i>
<i>  without fear</i>
<i>  of getting chewed up</i>

59:55.192 --> 59:57.459
<i> by witch doctor's main weapon.</i>

59:58.829 --> 1:00:01.129
<i> [kenny] yeah, and it's turning</i>
<i>  into a pushing match</i>
<i>  right now, chris.</i>

1:00:01.131 --> 1:00:04.466
<i>  They've come down to</i>
<i>  who the more powerful bot is.</i>

1:00:04.468 --> 1:00:07.069
<i> [chris] you see it there,</i>
<i>  the bots lock horns.</i>

1:00:07.071 --> 1:00:09.871
<i>  And how about this,</i>
<i>  duck! Driving witch doctor</i>

1:00:09.873 --> 1:00:11.673
<i>  into the screws</i>
<i>  of the upper deck?</i>

1:00:11.675 --> 1:00:15.611
<i>  Witch doctor is like,</i>
<i> "hey back off me, pal or hal."</i>

1:00:15.613 --> 1:00:19.047
<i>  hal rucker's duck!,</i>
<i> showing some effective control</i>
<i>  in this sequence</i>

1:00:19.049 --> 1:00:21.583
<i>  that will count big time.</i>

1:00:21.585 --> 1:00:25.187
<i> [kenny] this is going</i>
<i>  to come down to a battle</i>
<i>  of the drivetrains</i>

1:00:25.189 --> 1:00:29.725
<i>  of these two robots, chris,</i>
<i>  which one is going to exert</i>
<i>  its grill on the other</i>

1:00:29.727 --> 1:00:33.895
<i>  and control the action</i>
<i>  from here on out.</i>

1:00:33.897 --> 1:00:37.232
<i> [chris] witch doctor</i>
<i>  has now gone about</i>
<i>  a minute without its weapon.</i>

1:00:37.234 --> 1:00:38.767
<i>  So now trying to win</i>
<i>  the ground game</i>

1:00:38.769 --> 1:00:41.336
<i>  and utilize the battlebox</i>
<i>  to its advantage?</i>

1:00:41.338 --> 1:00:45.240
<i> [kenny] oh, nice strike</i>
<i>  by witch doctor</i>
<i>  with the pulverizer.</i>

1:00:45.242 --> 1:00:46.575
<i>  Oh, another.</i>

1:00:46.577 --> 1:00:49.211
<i> [chris] those shots</i>
<i>  from the hazards</i>
<i>  are so important</i>

1:00:49.213 --> 1:00:52.014
<i>  in fights like</i>
<i>  these where the bots</i>
<i>  are grinding it out</i>

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:56.618
<i>  and trying to show</i>
<i>  every bit of control</i>
<i>  that they can, kenny florian.</i>

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.954
<i> [kenny] and that can help</i>
<i>  as far as damage as well.</i>

1:00:58.956 --> 1:01:01.923
<i>  I'm impressed that</i>
<i>  with just one fork,</i>
<i>  their duck!</i>

1:01:01.925 --> 1:01:04.192
<i>  Is still able to get</i>
<i>  underneath witch doctor.</i>

1:01:04.194 --> 1:01:07.829
<i>  But look at that,</i>
<i>  that's what I'm talking about</i>
<i>  the power in that drivetrain</i>

1:01:07.831 --> 1:01:10.265
<i>  from witch doctor.</i>
<i>  They said they're gonna be</i>
<i>  more powerful</i>

1:01:10.267 --> 1:01:12.367
<i>  and you could see it</i>
<i>  straight away.</i>

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:14.770
<i> [chris] thirty seconds</i>
<i>  remaining in this one,</i>

1:01:14.772 --> 1:01:16.805
<i>  precious time to</i>
<i>  score a knockout</i>

1:01:16.807 --> 1:01:20.575
<i>  or impress the judges</i>
<i>  is ticking away.</i>

1:01:20.577 --> 1:01:24.146
<i> [kenny] witch doctor</i>
<i>  has really turned it on here</i>
<i>  down the stretch, chris.</i>

1:01:24.148 --> 1:01:28.050
<i>  They are the faster robot,</i>
<i>  the more powerful robot</i>
<i>  putting duck!</i>

1:01:28.052 --> 1:01:31.620
<i>  On its heels now pushing them</i>
<i>  around the battlebox.</i>

1:01:32.823 --> 1:01:37.025
<i> [chris] under ten to go.</i>
<i>  This one is going</i>
<i>  to the judges,</i>

1:01:37.027 --> 1:01:40.162
<i>  witch doctor bidding duck!</i>
<i>  To close out the action.</i>

1:01:40.164 --> 1:01:42.264
[crowd cheering]

1:01:44.668 --> 1:01:47.302
<i> [chris] kenny, duck!</i>
<i>  Lives up to its reputation</i>

1:01:47.304 --> 1:01:51.807
<i>  and goes a full three minutes</i>
<i>  with one of the games</i>
<i>  heaviest hitters.</i>

1:01:51.809 --> 1:01:53.608
<i> [kenny] the duck! Don't die.</i>

1:01:53.610 --> 1:01:55.744
<i>  The judges might like it,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

1:01:55.746 --> 1:02:01.083
<i> [chris] and we'll have</i>
<i>  the decision after a break,</i>
<i>  here on battlebots.</i>

1:02:10.694 --> 1:02:12.694
[chris]
<i>  we are back on battlebots</i>

1:02:12.696 --> 1:02:17.099
<i>  and as the judges tally up</i>
<i>  their scorecards</i>
<i>  after a three minute slugfest</i>

1:02:17.101 --> 1:02:19.601
<i>  between witch doctor</i>
<i>  and the mighty duck!,</i>

1:02:19.603 --> 1:02:22.037
<i>  let's take a look</i>
<i>  at the replay.</i>

1:02:23.874 --> 1:02:27.175
<i> [chris] kenny early on,</i>
<i>  witch doctor</i>
<i>  had everything working,</i>

1:02:27.177 --> 1:02:29.945
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  which doctor came out on fire</i>

1:02:29.947 --> 1:02:31.913
<i>  ripping that front fork</i>
<i>  off of duck!</i>

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:35.817
<i>  Following it up</i>
<i>  with some huge hits</i>
<i>  and racking up damage points.</i>

1:02:35.819 --> 1:02:39.988
<i>  But right here out-countered</i>
<i> with a beautifully placed shot</i>

1:02:39.990 --> 1:02:43.458
<i>  right into</i>
<i>  witch doctor's weapon</i>
<i>  and shut it down.</i>

1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:47.028
<i> [chris] and from there</i>
<i>  it became the kind of</i>
<i>  ugly duckling fight</i>

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:48.363
<i>  duck! Was looking for.</i>

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:51.133
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  we had a pushing match</i>
<i>  on our hands.</i>

1:02:51.135 --> 1:02:54.202
<i>  Duck! Stayed aggressive</i>
<i>  and did its best</i>
<i>  to capitalize, but for me,</i>

1:02:54.204 --> 1:02:57.606
<i>  it was witch doctor</i>
<i>  that proved</i>
<i>  to be the bigger bully</i>

1:02:57.608 --> 1:03:01.309
<i>  utilizing, what looked like,</i>
<i>  a superior drivetrain</i>
<i>  down the stretch,</i>

1:03:01.311 --> 1:03:05.080
<i>  duck! Never could get</i>
<i>  its lifter in the mix</i>
<i>  and mount an offensive,</i>

1:03:05.082 --> 1:03:08.350
<i>  and witch doctor</i>
<i>  seized control of the fight.</i>

1:03:09.987 --> 1:03:11.853
<i> [chris] let's see</i>
<i>  what the judges thought.</i>

1:03:11.855 --> 1:03:14.356
<i>  Here is faruq</i>
<i>  with the decision.</i>

1:03:16.026 --> 1:03:18.927
The results
from the judges are in.

1:03:18.929 --> 1:03:21.029
[crowd cheering]

1:03:23.133 --> 1:03:27.269
the winner
by unanimous decision is...

1:03:30.174 --> 1:03:32.541
Witch doctor!

1:03:32.543 --> 1:03:34.509
[crowd cheering]

1:03:43.253 --> 1:03:47.956
<i> [chris] andrea and mike,</i>
<i>  I hate to break up</i>
<i>  the love fest over there,</i>

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:50.325
but for the first minute
it looked like witch doctor

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:53.028
did exactly
what you wanted it to do.

1:03:53.030 --> 1:03:53.829
Am I right, andrea?

1:03:53.831 --> 1:03:55.063
Absolutely.

1:03:55.065 --> 1:03:57.599
Our number one objective
was not to break
those weapon disks.

1:03:57.601 --> 1:04:01.102
And duck! Is a tough robot
to go up against,
especially as our first match.

1:04:01.104 --> 1:04:04.206
So I'm really excited,
once the weapon
started slowing down...

1:04:04.208 --> 1:04:05.941
Obviously, we don't want
to see that,

1:04:05.943 --> 1:04:08.343
but I knew
something was wrong,
so I actually shut it off

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:10.011
because I thought
it would look worse
to the judges

1:04:10.013 --> 1:04:11.980
to see smoke than just
a weapon turned off.

1:04:11.982 --> 1:04:13.982
So I don't know
if that had an effect or not,

1:04:13.984 --> 1:04:16.151
but we were really prepared
for a judge's decision
with duck!

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:18.253
Because you
just can't ko him.

1:04:18.255 --> 1:04:21.223
You guys showed
your experience right there.

1:04:21.225 --> 1:04:23.091
What was the strategy,
it seemed like
you were going

1:04:23.093 --> 1:04:24.659
for the forks early as well?

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:28.196
Yeah, I mean,
that's obviously,
duck!'s strategy

1:04:28.198 --> 1:04:29.431
to get under us
with his fork.

1:04:29.433 --> 1:04:31.199
So and they're nice and long
and nice and tall,

1:04:31.201 --> 1:04:35.136
so we're hoping
we'd be able to disable those.

1:04:35.138 --> 1:04:37.505
And, you know, obviously
he's got three other nice,

1:04:37.507 --> 1:04:38.940
chewy sides
that we were going for,

1:04:38.942 --> 1:04:41.076
but the weapon
only lasted about a minute.

1:04:41.078 --> 1:04:44.079
So, we weren't able
to really get
a ton of hits on him.

1:04:44.081 --> 1:04:45.814
But what we did,
I think, looked pretty good.

1:04:45.816 --> 1:04:48.016
Andrea,
you are a fan favorite.

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:51.887
Your fans want to know,
is this a robot
that can win the giant nut?

1:04:51.889 --> 1:04:53.488
[crowd cheering]

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:55.957
I couldn't hear the question.

1:04:55.959 --> 1:04:57.225
Over the clapping.

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:59.394
Well, that's what
happens, you're so popular,

1:04:59.396 --> 1:05:00.996
you can't even hear.
I asked...

1:05:00.998 --> 1:05:02.197
[crowd cheering]

1:05:02.199 --> 1:05:04.199
<i>  see, they still love you,</i>
<i>  they love you.</i>

1:05:04.201 --> 1:05:10.805
Your fans want to know,
is this robot reliable enough
to win the giant nut?

1:05:10.807 --> 1:05:13.308
You know, teething issues
is not new for our team.

1:05:13.310 --> 1:05:15.877
We are experts
at recovering, and duck!

1:05:15.879 --> 1:05:18.079
Is as much of
a fan favorite as we are.

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:20.882
So I know either way,
this match went, we were
letting some people down,

1:05:20.884 --> 1:05:24.219
but we feel a lot of pressure
to our fans to not
let them down this year.

1:05:24.221 --> 1:05:26.288
Stay classy, witch doctor.

1:05:26.290 --> 1:05:28.423
You're off to 1-0
start. Congratulations.

1:05:28.425 --> 1:05:29.658
Thank you.

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:31.559
[crowd cheering]

1:05:35.899 --> 1:05:39.067
<i> [chris] so, this one ends up</i>
<i>  closer than expected,</i>

1:05:39.069 --> 1:05:41.903
<i>  but witch doctor</i>
<i>  is in the win column.</i>

1:05:41.905 --> 1:05:44.773
<i>  And for hal rucker and duck!</i>
<i>  A tough loss,</i>

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:47.242
<i>  but great to see them</i>
<i>  back inside the box</i>

1:05:47.244 --> 1:05:50.145
<i>  and making a top team</i>
<i>  earn every points.</i>

1:05:51.348 --> 1:05:54.282
<i>  Okay, folks, we have arrived.</i>

1:05:54.284 --> 1:05:56.885
<i>  Up next, our main event</i>
<i>  of the evening,</i>

1:05:56.887 --> 1:05:59.654
<i>  the venomous vehicle</i>
<i>  copperhead,</i>

1:05:59.656 --> 1:06:02.891
<i>  now under new captains</i>
<i>  kimberly and robert cowan,</i>

1:06:02.893 --> 1:06:09.130
<i>  takes on lock-jaw</i>
<i>  led by battlebots</i>
<i>  og donald hutson.</i>

1:06:11.034 --> 1:06:13.902
<i> [faruq] it's lock-jaw!</i>

1:06:13.904 --> 1:06:16.871
<i> Coming back to battlebots</i>
<i> after all these years...</i>

1:06:16.873 --> 1:06:18.907
<i> [chris] donald hutson,</i>
<i>  the legend.</i>

1:06:18.909 --> 1:06:20.842
[donald]
<i>  ...It still makes me nervous,</i>

1:06:20.844 --> 1:06:24.112
<i>  kind of gives</i>
<i>  a little shortness of breath.</i>

1:06:24.114 --> 1:06:29.484
<i>  You can just hear</i>
<i>  the sound of that beep,</i>
<i>  beep, beep.</i>

1:06:30.988 --> 1:06:33.621
And your blood pressure
goes up.

1:06:33.623 --> 1:06:35.457
<i>  All of a sudden,</i>
<i>  it's all gone.</i>

1:06:38.862 --> 1:06:40.495
<i>  It's all quiet.</i>

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:46.368
<i>  All you think about</i>
<i>  is driving the robot.</i>

1:06:48.972 --> 1:06:50.405
And so, try and take 'em out.

1:06:50.407 --> 1:06:51.906
<i> [chris] whoa!</i>

1:06:51.908 --> 1:06:53.208
<i>  What a shot.</i>

1:06:53.210 --> 1:06:56.444
This is going to be a tough,
tough tournament.

1:06:56.446 --> 1:06:59.948
<i> [chris] oh,</i>
<i>  no mercy from lock-jaw.</i>

1:06:59.950 --> 1:07:02.217
[donald]
<i>  we're gonna have to fight</i>
<i>  for this championship</i>

1:07:02.219 --> 1:07:03.585
<i>  there's no doubt.</i>

1:07:05.188 --> 1:07:08.223
<i> [faruq] it's copperhead.</i>

1:07:09.159 --> 1:07:12.394
Last year was a good season
until it wasn't.

1:07:12.396 --> 1:07:14.929
<i>  First three fights,</i>
<i>  we had some good knockouts.</i>

1:07:14.931 --> 1:07:17.132
<i> [chris] oh, what a shot.</i>

1:07:17.134 --> 1:07:21.202
<i>  An unbelievable performance</i>
<i>  by copperhead.</i>

1:07:21.204 --> 1:07:23.772
And then
going into the finals,
we just kind of lost it.

1:07:23.774 --> 1:07:27.175
[chris]
<i>  this is a monumental upset.</i>

1:07:30.981 --> 1:07:33.248
[robert]
<i>  we've always been plagued</i>
<i>  with drive issues,</i>

1:07:33.250 --> 1:07:37.085
so we completely
stripped out the drive,
rebuilt the drive.

1:07:37.087 --> 1:07:41.089
<i>  We have this frame</i>
<i>  that's one inch thick,</i>
<i>  hard aux, but then inside,</i>

1:07:41.091 --> 1:07:45.326
it's all really
modern brushless technology
and very high tech stuff.

1:07:46.196 --> 1:07:48.630
<i>  This year, things are gonna</i>
<i>  go a lot better.</i>

1:07:48.632 --> 1:07:50.565
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

1:07:52.202 --> 1:07:54.335
Going into our fight
against lock-jaw,

1:07:54.337 --> 1:07:57.205
what we're really looking to
do is try and out-drive them,

1:07:57.207 --> 1:07:59.908
<i>  and that is obviously</i>
<i>  a very tall task</i>

1:07:59.910 --> 1:08:02.777
<i>  because it's donald hutson,</i>
<i>  the legend.</i>

1:08:02.779 --> 1:08:04.112
<i> [chris] unbelievable,</i>

1:08:04.114 --> 1:08:06.114
<i>  the driving by donald hutson.</i>

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:07.282
<i>  He is ruthless.</i>

1:08:07.284 --> 1:08:09.717
Bot to bot, I think,
ultimately,

1:08:09.719 --> 1:08:11.753
we do have
a better bot than he has.

1:08:11.755 --> 1:08:14.823
<i>  But we're gonna have</i>
<i>  to be on our game.</i>

1:08:14.825 --> 1:08:18.293
I think,
I have a more powerful weapon
that spins up a lot faster.

1:08:18.295 --> 1:08:19.794
<i>  We're gonna try</i>
<i>  and out drive them</i>

1:08:19.796 --> 1:08:21.463
<i>  and just get</i>
<i>  a couple of quick hits.</i>

1:08:21.465 --> 1:08:23.164
<i> [chris] oh, look at that!</i>

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:27.001
Our strategy... Smash.

1:08:27.003 --> 1:08:30.405
<i>  We want to use that weapon</i>
<i>  as much as possible.</i>

1:08:30.407 --> 1:08:32.107
<i> [chris] oh, my goodness.</i>

1:08:32.109 --> 1:08:35.910
The new box configuration
is just kind of
squeezed us all down.

1:08:35.912 --> 1:08:39.380
<i>  There's places to be trapped,</i>
<i>  there's places to be stuck.</i>

1:08:39.382 --> 1:08:41.616
<i>  It's gonna be</i>
<i>  much more of a bloodbath.</i>

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:42.851
<i> [chris] whoa!</i>

1:08:42.853 --> 1:08:45.787
<i>  A fight filled</i>
<i>  with mayhem and chaos.</i>

1:08:45.789 --> 1:08:47.388
I don't think,
copperhead is one of the bots

1:08:47.390 --> 1:08:49.224
that you want
to put in a corner.

1:08:50.894 --> 1:08:53.294
'cause we got a big bite
right up front.

1:08:54.431 --> 1:08:55.830
<i> [chris] oh, my gosh.</i>

1:08:55.832 --> 1:08:57.432
<i>  I love it!</i>

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.974
[david fay]
<i>  I'm local las vegas artist,</i>
<i>  david fay.</i>

1:09:05.976 --> 1:09:08.376
<i>  Assemblage art is what I do,</i>
<i>  metal assemblage art,</i>

1:09:08.378 --> 1:09:11.513
so it's taking trash
and turning it into treasure,
I hope.

1:09:12.749 --> 1:09:15.250
I like to think of it
as treasure.

1:09:15.252 --> 1:09:19.320
<i> [chris] whoa! I think,</i>
<i>  a tooth just flew off</i>
<i>  the shrederator.</i>

1:09:21.791 --> 1:09:25.860
<i>  Oh, shrapnel</i>
<i>  all over the battlebox.</i>

1:09:25.862 --> 1:09:28.163
<i> [david fay] what I'm doing is</i>
<i>  I'm taking the wreckage</i>
<i>  from these fights</i>

1:09:28.165 --> 1:09:33.201
<i> and I'm creating the sculpture</i>
<i>  that we can then</i>
<i>  auction off for charity.</i>

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:38.173
My thoughts and ideas
are to build this trojan horse

1:09:38.175 --> 1:09:41.876
<i>  because it's the hidden</i>
<i>  competitor within</i>
<i>  that's gonna win the battle.</i>

1:09:41.878 --> 1:09:45.647
This is an amazing experience
and I wanna thank
all the builders

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:48.616
for all their hard work
and everything they put
into these robots

1:09:48.618 --> 1:09:50.652
to get them into that arena.

1:09:50.654 --> 1:09:52.854
<i>  And I can't wait for you</i>
<i>  to see the sculpture</i>

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:55.256
<i>  and see your parts</i>
<i>  and pieces in it.</i>

1:09:55.258 --> 1:09:58.092
<i>  And I hope it lives</i>
<i> up to your expectations, guys.</i>

1:10:04.401 --> 1:10:06.668
[crowd cheering]

1:10:06.670 --> 1:10:08.269
we are back
<i> on battlebots.</i>

1:10:08.271 --> 1:10:10.638
Are they chanting your name?
Are you fighting
here in vegas?

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.806
I don't know.

1:10:11.808 --> 1:10:13.408
How'd you do in vegas,
by the way, back in the day?

1:10:13.410 --> 1:10:14.609
-I did well, actually.
-Did you?

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:16.778
Yeah, it was,
it was overall pretty good.

1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:19.113
<i> [chris] okay, kenny,</i>
<i>  it is time for the main event</i>

1:10:19.115 --> 1:10:21.950
<i>  and this is a heck</i>
<i>  of a matchup.</i>

1:10:21.952 --> 1:10:26.788
<i>  Copperhead, lock-jaw</i>
<i>  two legitimate</i>
<i>  giant nut contenders.</i>

1:10:26.790 --> 1:10:30.024
<i>  And let's start</i>
<i>  with copperhead.</i>

1:10:30.026 --> 1:10:33.628
<i>  Zach goff,</i>
<i>  the captain from last year,</i>
<i>  taking the season off,</i>

1:10:33.630 --> 1:10:38.333
<i>  so turning over the controls</i>
<i>  to the married couple</i>
<i>  of robert and kimberly cowan,</i>

1:10:38.335 --> 1:10:41.069
which makes sense
because copperhead actually
lives in their garage.

1:10:41.071 --> 1:10:42.670
Free loader, by the way.

1:10:42.672 --> 1:10:45.206
<i>  You'll remember, in 2020,</i>
<i>  copperhead was great.</i>

1:10:45.208 --> 1:10:48.142
<i>  3-0</i>
<i>  during the regular season,</i>
<i>  number three overall seed</i>

1:10:48.144 --> 1:10:50.345
<i>  upset in the round of 32.</i>

1:10:50.347 --> 1:10:53.848
<i>  But robert said</i>
<i>  even though we had a perfect</i>
<i>  regular season record,</i>

1:10:53.850 --> 1:10:56.951
<i>  there were still plenty</i>
<i>  of blemishes with this robot.</i>

1:10:56.953 --> 1:10:58.486
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  that shocking loss</i>
<i>  to mammoth,</i>

1:10:58.488 --> 1:10:59.854
<i>  obviously, still hurts.</i>

1:10:59.856 --> 1:11:02.991
<i>  But as they told us,</i>
<i>  they've taken</i>
<i>  a lot of the weaknesses</i>

1:11:02.993 --> 1:11:05.560
<i>  out of an already</i>
<i>  excellent copperhead</i>

1:11:05.562 --> 1:11:09.030
<i>  and they think they've got</i>
<i>  a championship level bot.</i>

1:11:09.032 --> 1:11:13.067
Taking out one of the og's
of the sport,
donald hutson and lock-jaw.

1:11:13.069 --> 1:11:15.169
<i>  And it was kind of</i>
<i>  a rough 2020 season.</i>

1:11:15.171 --> 1:11:16.971
<i>  You can hear</i>
<i>  the fans chant for him.</i>

1:11:16.973 --> 1:11:21.643
<i>  Very, very popular</i>
<i> robot. Donald couldn't make it</i>
<i>  out of the round of 32.</i>

1:11:21.645 --> 1:11:23.378
<i>  So, did he take</i>
<i>  an early vacation?</i>

1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:24.812
<i>  Of course not.</i>

1:11:24.814 --> 1:11:27.715
<i>  He got right back</i>
<i>  in the box and won a bounty.</i>

1:11:27.717 --> 1:11:31.552
<i>  You simply cannot count</i>
<i>  this team out ever.</i>

1:11:31.554 --> 1:11:32.987
<i> [kenny] the way</i>
<i>  lock-jaw tore through</i>

1:11:32.989 --> 1:11:36.958
<i>  the beat up bounty tournament</i>
<i>  that was an artist at work.</i>

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:39.961
<i>  They want</i>
<i>  to keep that momentum</i>
<i>  going into this season.</i>

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:43.031
<i>  Donald won a desperado,</i>
<i>  he's won a bounty.</i>

1:11:43.033 --> 1:11:46.267
<i>  Now it's time to put together</i>
<i>  a dominant regular season</i>

1:11:46.269 --> 1:11:50.571
<i>  and prove that lock-jaw</i>
<i> is a true giant nut contender.</i>

1:11:51.941 --> 1:11:53.408
Does that first step
start tonight?

1:11:53.410 --> 1:11:55.209
Let's find out. Faruq.

1:11:55.912 --> 1:11:57.612
[crowd cheering]

1:12:00.317 --> 1:12:04.619
[faruq] ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

1:12:04.621 --> 1:12:06.421
[crowd cheering]

1:12:10.260 --> 1:12:14.095
it's time for the main event.

1:12:14.097 --> 1:12:16.331
[crowd cheering]

1:12:25.742 --> 1:12:29.377
in the red square,
this bot may be tiny,

1:12:29.379 --> 1:12:31.646
but if it manages
to land shots,

1:12:31.648 --> 1:12:33.414
you're going straight out
of the park,

1:12:33.416 --> 1:12:34.949
<i>  like that movie, the sandlot.</i>

1:12:34.951 --> 1:12:36.150
Yeah, yeah.

1:12:36.152 --> 1:12:39.287
This little thing is
a beast, winning
all of its brawls,

1:12:39.289 --> 1:12:41.923
so you better jet
or you'll be screaming,

1:12:41.925 --> 1:12:44.025
"you're killing me, smalls."

1:12:44.027 --> 1:12:47.528
give it up for copperhead!

1:12:47.530 --> 1:12:49.097
[crowd cheering]

1:12:51.768 --> 1:12:56.037
<i> [chris] there they are,</i>
<i>  team copperhead, snaked out</i>
<i>  from head to toe.</i>

1:12:56.039 --> 1:12:58.272
<i>  This is an intimidating</i>
<i>  machine, kenny,</i>

1:12:58.274 --> 1:13:01.709
<i>  and look at the size</i>
<i>  of those tires.</i>

1:13:01.711 --> 1:13:03.611
<i> [kenny] they're almost</i>
<i>  as big as the bot.</i>

1:13:03.613 --> 1:13:05.780
<i>  They've even got</i>
<i>  the snake mini bot.</i>

1:13:05.782 --> 1:13:08.249
<i>  A lot of things</i>
<i>  to love about copperhead,</i>

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:10.952
<i>  but none more than that</i>
<i>  drum spinner.</i>

1:13:10.954 --> 1:13:13.621
<i>  Man, is that thing dope.</i>

1:13:13.623 --> 1:13:16.090
<i> [chris] by the way,</i>
<i>  she's got a real snake</i>
<i>  around her neck.</i>

1:13:16.092 --> 1:13:18.493
<i> -[kenny] I was going to say.</i>
<i> -[chris] holy...</i>

1:13:23.233 --> 1:13:28.035
In the blue square,
like a root canal,
he'll bring the pain,

1:13:28.037 --> 1:13:31.272
he's giving you two weapons
and no novocaine.

1:13:31.274 --> 1:13:34.976
Rocks bots sky high
like there's no gravity,

1:13:34.978 --> 1:13:37.412
then fills up their graves
like a cavity.

1:13:37.414 --> 1:13:40.848
It's lock-jaw!

1:13:40.850 --> 1:13:42.950
[crowd cheering]

1:13:46.723 --> 1:13:49.023
<i> [chris] you know,</i>
<i>  kenny, back in 1999,</i>

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:53.628
<i>  donald hutson won</i>
<i>  a battelbots tournament</i>
<i>  right here in vegas.</i>

1:13:53.630 --> 1:13:57.832
<i>  And from what we've heard,</i>
<i>  he thinks he's got</i>
<i>  a serious shot at another one</i>

1:13:57.834 --> 1:13:59.934
<i> with this version of lock-jaw.</i>

1:13:59.936 --> 1:14:04.172
<i> [kenny] that's right, in 2020,</i>
<i>  he was working out</i>
<i>  what he calls new bot bugs,</i>

1:14:04.174 --> 1:14:07.208
<i>  but he's taken</i>
<i>  all the best aspects</i>
<i>  of that bot</i>

1:14:07.210 --> 1:14:11.078
<i>  and turned it up to a 10.</i>
<i>  That vertical weapon</i>
<i>  is spinning up</i>

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:14.882
<i>  to 250 miles per hour</i>
<i>  in only a few seconds.</i>

1:14:14.884 --> 1:14:16.184
<i>  The bot is durable.</i>

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:18.886
<i>  It can drive inverted</i>
<i>  if it needs to.</i>

1:14:18.888 --> 1:14:20.822
<i>  I can't wait to see it</i>
<i>  in action.</i>

1:14:20.824 --> 1:14:22.957

<i> [chris] getting a good look</i>
<i>  at copperhead,</i>

1:14:26.930 --> 1:14:29.864
<i>  and I thought</i>
<i>  robert's philosophy</i>
<i>  on how to win this fight</i>

1:14:29.866 --> 1:14:31.399
<i>  was very interesting kenny.</i>

1:14:31.401 --> 1:14:33.234
<i> [kenny] well, yeah,</i>
<i>  I mean, listen, he said.</i>

1:14:33.236 --> 1:14:37.772
<i>  All we got to do is hit them</i>
<i>  as much as possible,</i>
<i>  wherever and whenever.</i>

1:14:37.774 --> 1:14:39.073
<i>  Forget being technical.</i>

1:14:39.075 --> 1:14:41.542
<i>  Go out there</i>
<i>  and strike, and strike first.</i>

1:14:41.544 --> 1:14:43.144
<i>  I don't know</i>
<i>  if it's the best strategy,</i>

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:46.380
<i>  but you gotta love</i>

<i>  they have in their weapon.</i>

1:15:02.866 --> 1:15:06.334
<i>  Kenny, a lot of tension</i>
<i>  here in the arena.</i>

1:15:06.336 --> 1:15:08.503
<i> [kenny] you can see it</i>
<i>  on donald's face.</i>

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:10.238
<i>  He wants this one.</i>

1:15:29.125 --> 1:15:32.560

<i> [chris] copperhead, lock-jaw.</i>

<i>  Hold on to your lug nuts.</i>

1:15:58.621 --> 1:16:00.755
<i>  Let the bot battle begin!</i>

1:16:00.757 --> 1:16:02.957
<i>  Lock-jaw in pursuit</i>
<i>  out of the gate.</i>

1:16:02.959 --> 1:16:07.094
<i>  Looking to be aggressive,</i>
<i>  but drive directly</i>
<i>  on top of copperhead here.</i>

1:16:07.096 --> 1:16:10.298
<i>  That's playing</i>
<i>  with some serious fire.</i>

1:16:10.300 --> 1:16:12.199
<i>  Oh, you can hear</i>
<i>  those weapons.</i>

1:16:12.201 --> 1:16:14.201
<i>  Really grinding up.</i>

1:16:14.203 --> 1:16:16.871
<i> [kenny] lock-jaw</i>
<i>  going out there</i>
<i>  using its plow there.</i>

1:16:16.873 --> 1:16:18.940
<i>  Right against their primary</i>
<i>  weapon to copperhead,</i>

1:16:18.942 --> 1:16:20.207
<i>  copperhead gets</i>
<i>  underneath, though.</i>

1:16:20.209 --> 1:16:22.143
<i> [chris] yeah,</i>
<i>  it could definitely do</i>
<i>  some damage</i>

1:16:22.145 --> 1:16:24.845
<i>  to lock-jaw</i>
<i>  from the underbelly.</i>

1:16:24.847 --> 1:16:27.949
<i>  Oh, yes, weapon</i>
<i>  on weapon, sparks fly.</i>

1:16:27.951 --> 1:16:29.116
<i>  Big impact there.</i>

1:16:29.118 --> 1:16:32.353
<i>  Lock-jaw</i>
<i>  not backing down at all.</i>

1:16:33.957 --> 1:16:36.958
<i>  Ah! You heard robert cowan</i>
<i>  and copperhead</i>
<i>  saying he wanted to go weapon</i>

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:38.626
<i>  on a weapon with lock-jaw.</i>

1:16:38.628 --> 1:16:40.227
<i>  The dude was not lying.</i>

1:16:40.229 --> 1:16:43.931
<i>  Oh, big shot by copperhead.</i>

1:16:43.933 --> 1:16:46.968
<i> [kenny] how long</i>
<i>  can these two weapons</i>
<i>  last, chris?</i>

1:16:46.970 --> 1:16:48.769
<i>  It feels like</i>
<i>  we're gonna find out.</i>

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:51.839
<i> [chris] well,</i>
<i>  copperhead winning the battle</i>
<i>  for low ground so far,</i>

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:54.041
<i>  lock-jaw is absorbing</i>
<i>  the punishment.</i>

1:16:54.043 --> 1:16:56.644
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  definitely. Seems like</i>
<i>  that suspension system</i>

1:16:56.646 --> 1:16:58.212
<i>  of lock-jaw is serving it</i>
<i>  well right now.</i>

1:16:58.214 --> 1:17:00.615
<i>  I think there's a problem</i>
<i>  with...</i>

1:17:00.617 --> 1:17:02.283
<i>  Double hit there</i>
<i>  from copperhead</i>

1:17:02.285 --> 1:17:04.352
<i>  and those forks</i>
<i>  are getting messed up.</i>

1:17:04.354 --> 1:17:05.753
<i>  Oh, my gosh.</i>

1:17:05.755 --> 1:17:07.154
We're good, we're
good, we're good.

1:17:07.156 --> 1:17:09.223
<i> [chris] oh, yeah,</i>
<i>  that left fork</i>
<i>  is bent backward,</i>

1:17:09.225 --> 1:17:11.826
<i>  that left front wheels</i>
<i>  hanging up for dear life</i>

1:17:11.828 --> 1:17:14.328
<i>  and lock-jaw is</i>
<i>  behind the eight ball now.</i>

1:17:14.330 --> 1:17:16.931
<i>  But suddenly copperhead</i>
<i>  looked stunned, too.</i>

1:17:16.933 --> 1:17:18.366
<i> [kenny] yeah, that's right.</i>

1:17:18.701 --> 1:17:20.134
<i>  It seems like</i>
<i>  they might be trying</i>
<i>  to get some space as well</i>

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:21.969
<i>  to try to get that weapon</i>
<i>  up to speed.</i>

1:17:21.971 --> 1:17:24.071
<i> [chris] oh,</i>
<i>  lock-jaw is on fire!</i>

1:17:24.073 --> 1:17:27.908
<i>  We have seen this</i>
<i>  in seasons past.</i>

1:17:27.910 --> 1:17:30.044
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  he may have to shut down</i>
<i>  their primary weapon.</i>

1:17:30.046 --> 1:17:32.079
<i>  Big hit by copperhead.</i>

1:17:32.081 --> 1:17:33.447
<i>  Right in front of us.</i>

1:17:33.449 --> 1:17:35.249
<i> [chris] and now lock-jaw</i>
<i>  is on its head.</i>

1:17:35.251 --> 1:17:36.984
<i>  Can it self-right?</i>

1:17:36.986 --> 1:17:38.619
<i>  Oh!</i>

1:17:38.621 --> 1:17:41.155
<i>  Copperhead says,</i>
<i>  "maybe I could be</i>
<i>  of some assistance</i>

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:43.290
<i>  in that department, sir."</i>

1:17:43.292 --> 1:17:45.192
<i> [kenny] that fork</i>
<i>  is really messed up,</i>

1:17:45.194 --> 1:17:47.194
<i>  and they typically</i>
<i>  use that to self-right,</i>

1:17:47.196 --> 1:17:49.664
<i>  but there's a major problem</i>
<i>  with it right now.</i>

1:17:49.666 --> 1:17:52.566
<i>  Copperhead going</i>
<i>  to town on lock-jaw.</i>

1:17:52.568 --> 1:17:56.637
<i> [chris] that weapon</i>
<i>  has been dishing out pain</i>
<i>  since the opening bell.</i>

1:17:56.639 --> 1:18:00.775
<i> [kenny] now we know</i>
<i>  why the cowans were</i>
<i>  so confident about their bot.</i>

1:18:00.777 --> 1:18:02.376
<i> [chris] under a minute to go.</i>

1:18:02.378 --> 1:18:04.912
<i>  Copperhead looking a</i>
<i>  a little out of control here</i>
<i>  in the second half</i>

1:18:04.914 --> 1:18:09.483
<i>  but continuing</i>
<i>  to attack and grind away.</i>

1:18:09.485 --> 1:18:12.987
<i> [kenny] there's been</i>
<i>  some massive hits</i>
<i>  by both robots here,</i>

1:18:12.989 --> 1:18:17.658
<i>  but no doubt about it,</i>
<i>  lock-jaw showing way,</i>
<i>  way more wear and tear here.</i>

1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:21.162
<i> [chris] but how about</i>
<i>  lock-jaw shows off</i>
<i>  that powerful drivetrain,</i>

1:18:21.164 --> 1:18:24.065
<i>  just bullying copperhead</i>
<i>  into the screws,</i>

1:18:24.067 --> 1:18:26.967
<i> [kenny] yeah, donald hutson</i>
<i>  an amazing driver</i>
<i>  doing his best</i>

1:18:26.969 --> 1:18:29.370
<i>  to hang in there and jam up</i>
<i>  that primary weapon.</i>

1:18:29.372 --> 1:18:32.740
<i>  I don't think that</i>
<i>  thing has stopped</i>
<i>  spinning for one second.</i>

1:18:32.742 --> 1:18:34.375
<i> [chris] no doubt, it</i>
<i>  has been a rock.</i>

1:18:34.377 --> 1:18:37.845
<i>  Look at lock-jaw</i>
<i>  playing the aggressor</i>
<i>  down the stretch.</i>

1:18:37.847 --> 1:18:40.648
<i>  Oh,</i>
<i>  a big pop by copperhead.</i>

1:18:41.851 --> 1:18:43.951
<i> [kenny] nice recovery</i>
<i>  by donald hutson.</i>

1:18:43.953 --> 1:18:47.621
<i>  He's done a great job</i>
<i>  of resetting</i>
<i>  and staying aggressive</i>

1:18:47.623 --> 1:18:49.123
<i>  after those exchanges.</i>

1:18:49.125 --> 1:18:50.891
<i>  What a fight!</i>

1:18:50.927 --> 1:18:55.362
<i> [chris] and we have got</i>
<i>  a double decker bus sandwich</i>
<i>  to finish off three minutes</i>

1:18:55.364 --> 1:18:59.800
<i>  of back and forth action</i>
<i>  here in las vegas.</i>

1:18:59.802 --> 1:19:02.069
[crowd cheering]

1:19:02.071 --> 1:19:04.739
<i>  an amazing performance</i>
<i>  by both bots</i>

1:19:04.741 --> 1:19:08.576
<i>  and now this one</i>
<i>  will go to the judges.</i>

1:19:10.513 --> 1:19:12.947
<i> [chris] kenny, snakes</i>
<i>  usually lie in wait,</i>

1:19:12.949 --> 1:19:18.419
<i>  but not this one, copperhead</i>
<i>  was in attack mode</i>
<i>  from the jump.</i>

1:19:18.421 --> 1:19:19.854
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  robert cowan's game plan</i>

1:19:19.856 --> 1:19:21.989
<i>  was to put that drum spinner</i>
<i>  to work.</i>

1:19:21.991 --> 1:19:25.626
<i>  And my goodness,</i>
<i>  did he stick to it</i>
<i>  every time lock-jaw</i>

1:19:25.628 --> 1:19:28.896
<i>  engaged</i>
<i>  with its vertical spinner,</i>
<i>  copperhead was right there</i>

1:19:28.898 --> 1:19:32.099
<i>  for the weapon on weapon hit.</i>

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:35.836
<i> [chris] and copperheads</i>
<i>  certainly got the better</i>
<i>  of those exchanges.</i>

1:19:35.838 --> 1:19:37.972
<i>  Their weapon</i>
<i>  never stopped spinning</i>

1:19:37.974 --> 1:19:40.975
<i>  while donald's went up</i>
<i>  in flames.</i>

1:19:40.977 --> 1:19:44.578
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  but somehow lock-jaw</i>
<i>  was the more aggressive bot</i>

1:19:44.580 --> 1:19:46.313
<i>  in that second half.</i>

1:19:46.616 --> 1:19:51.285
<i>  Donald used his rear wedge</i>
<i>  to try and jam up that weapon</i>
<i>  throughout the fight,</i>

1:19:51.287 --> 1:19:54.021
<i>  and despite spending</i>
<i>  a good portion</i>
<i>  of the match inverted,</i>

1:19:54.023 --> 1:19:57.825
<i>  donald managed to control</i>
<i>  much of the action</i>
<i>  down the stretch</i>

1:19:57.827 --> 1:20:00.594
<i>  as copperhead was swinging</i>
<i>  for the fences.</i>

1:20:00.596 --> 1:20:03.330
<i> [chris] wall to wall action</i>
<i>  in this main event.</i>

1:20:03.332 --> 1:20:06.400
<i>  Let's head over to faruq</i>
<i>  with the decision.</i>

1:20:09.105 --> 1:20:12.106
The results
from the judges are in.

1:20:12.108 --> 1:20:14.141
[crowd cheering]

1:20:16.679 --> 1:20:19.580
we have a split decision.

1:20:22.318 --> 1:20:27.988
Judge jason scored
the battle for copperhead.

1:20:29.792 --> 1:20:35.029
Judge derek scored
the battle for lock-jaw.

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:43.103
Judge lisa scored the battle
for the winner...

1:20:48.511 --> 1:20:50.845
Copperhead!

1:20:50.847 --> 1:20:52.613
[crowd cheering]

1:21:04.093 --> 1:21:08.329
robert and kimberly, uh,
sigh of relief?

1:21:08.331 --> 1:21:09.897
Yeah, I don't...

1:21:09.899 --> 1:21:12.066
Why couldn't you make
that easier on us, man?

1:21:12.068 --> 1:21:13.767
You just wouldn't die.

1:21:13.769 --> 1:21:15.102
You just kept going.

1:21:15.104 --> 1:21:17.905
Were you surprised that
it was a split decision

1:21:17.907 --> 1:21:20.140
based on
what we saw inside the box?

1:21:20.142 --> 1:21:21.976
-No, no. Not at all.
-Why?

1:21:23.679 --> 1:21:25.145
Did you watch the match?

1:21:25.147 --> 1:21:27.448
I mean, it was back and forth
the whole time.

1:21:27.450 --> 1:21:30.885
So he got hits, we got hits
and just we both kept going.

1:21:30.887 --> 1:21:31.819
Yeah.

1:21:31.821 --> 1:21:34.088
You said you want
to just stay aggressive

1:21:34.090 --> 1:21:38.025
and kind of get rid
of being a technical driver
and just get in their face.

1:21:38.027 --> 1:21:40.594
Are you pretty happy
with your performance?

1:21:40.596 --> 1:21:43.831
Um, no. I think anything
that goes to a split decision,

1:21:43.833 --> 1:21:46.133
we got to try better
so that we can get a knockout.

1:21:46.135 --> 1:21:47.501
We need a knockout next time.

1:21:47.503 --> 1:21:48.736
Kimberly?

1:21:48.738 --> 1:21:50.070
Yes.

1:21:50.072 --> 1:21:51.672
Why do you have a real snake
around your neck

1:21:51.674 --> 1:21:53.374
and your husband's
got a fake one?

1:21:55.244 --> 1:21:58.045
'cause I secretly
wear the pants in the family

1:21:58.047 --> 1:21:59.513
[laughs]

1:22:02.018 --> 1:22:03.017
wow.

1:22:03.019 --> 1:22:04.952
The snake pants.

1:22:06.289 --> 1:22:09.423
Congratulations
on your first win
as co-captains.

1:22:09.425 --> 1:22:10.724
Thank you.

1:22:10.726 --> 1:22:12.293
[crowd cheering]

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:19.166
<i> [chris] kenny, it's</i>
<i>  interesting because</i>

1:22:19.201 --> 1:22:22.503
robert, kimberly cowan felt
like, yeah, it should have
been a split decision.

1:22:22.505 --> 1:22:24.905
I don't know. Maybe I saw it
through a different lens here.

1:22:24.907 --> 1:22:26.407
I thought they were dominant.

1:22:26.409 --> 1:22:28.776
Well, listen, I think
the difference was
their primary weapon.

1:22:28.778 --> 1:22:31.011
<i>  They were the ones</i>
<i>  who are really doling out</i>

1:22:31.013 --> 1:22:32.980
<i>  most of the hits</i>
<i>  throughout the fight.</i>

1:22:32.982 --> 1:22:35.049
<i>  Their primary weapon</i>
<i>  never went down,</i>

1:22:35.051 --> 1:22:38.185
<i>  whereas the primary weapon</i>
<i>  of lock-jaw did go down.</i>

1:22:38.187 --> 1:22:41.121
<i>  So, I thought it was going</i>
<i>  to be pretty clear</i>
<i>  for copperhead.</i>

1:22:41.123 --> 1:22:43.324
But it was
a very exciting fight

1:22:43.326 --> 1:22:46.160
and lock-jaw got
some great hits in early on.

1:22:46.162 --> 1:22:48.929
<i> [chris] all right,</i>
<i>  what a stellar night</i>
<i>  of action.</i>

1:22:48.931 --> 1:22:53.767
<i>  We saw stone cold</i>
<i>  knockouts from hyper shock</i>
<i>  and black dragon,</i>

1:22:53.769 --> 1:22:56.170
<i>  while others, like p1</i>
<i>  and copperhead,</i>

1:22:56.172 --> 1:23:00.140
<i>  had to rely on the judges</i>
<i>  for their first victory.</i>

1:23:00.142 --> 1:23:03.177
But I got to tell you,
I thought
the headliner, unquestionably,

1:23:03.179 --> 1:23:04.611
was reese ewert's bot fusion.

1:23:04.613 --> 1:23:07.648
That's right. I mean,
again, you look at
their bot last season,

1:23:07.650 --> 1:23:10.584
<i>  they had a ton of problems,</i>
<i>  a ton of inconsistencies.</i>

1:23:10.586 --> 1:23:13.954
<i>  This time,</i>
<i>  they were very consistent</i>
<i>  and very dangerous.</i>

1:23:13.956 --> 1:23:17.157
So, another fun night here
<i> at battlebots.</i>
<i> Once again for faruq,</i>

1:23:17.159 --> 1:23:20.160
our bot whisperer, pete,
my man, kenny florian,

1:23:20.162 --> 1:23:24.031
I'm chris rose.
We'll see you next time
<i> here on battlebots.</i>

1:23:24.033 --> 1:23:25.966
