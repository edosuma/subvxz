WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:12.416 --> 01:15.583
Come on. This way.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.750
Come along, Piglet.

01:35.458 --> 01:37.708
Oh, dear.

01:37.708 --> 01:40.125
If only six very small animals

01:40.125 --> 01:42.875
didn't have such
very short legs.

01:42.875 --> 01:46.125
Hurry, Piglet.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.166
No time to be brave.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.291
Oh, no. Where can we go?
What can we do?

01:53.291 --> 01:54.750
How can we hide?

01:54.750 --> 01:56.958
Terrifying, isn't it?

01:56.958 --> 01:58.833
Christopher Robin:
Quick, under here.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.291
Too late. It's found us.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.875
- It's the mummy!

02:08.875 --> 02:11.500
Christopher Robin,

02:11.500 --> 02:14.500
could you please come out
and eat your vegetables?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.583
Aw, Mom.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.583
Carrots are so-- so yucky.

02:19.583 --> 02:22.875
True. But they're
very good for you.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.291
And we did have a deal,

02:24.291 --> 02:26.958
which is you finish
your vegetables

02:26.958 --> 02:28.375
and you can go to the movies.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.500
You gotta
bite the carrot, kiddo.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.583
All right.

02:44.333 --> 02:47.208
Carrots, do your worst.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.333
Yecch!

02:55.083 --> 02:57.250
Oh, Christopher Robin,

02:57.250 --> 02:58.875
speak to us.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.875
Ooh, what a brave,
brave thing.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.833
All right, stand back.
Stand back.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.458
Give the kid some air.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.708
Mom: Well, you'd better
not stay down there

03:07.708 --> 03:09.333
enjoying your lunch
too long.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.083
You'll miss
your monster movie.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.875
Monster movie?

03:12.875 --> 03:16.500
I thought we were going
to see a c-c-cartoon.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.375
It certainly has
a nice s-smile,

03:24.375 --> 03:25.416
hasn't it?

03:25.416 --> 03:27.416
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:27.416 --> 03:29.708
Yikes! Ooh! Ooh!

03:29.708 --> 03:35.250
Remember, Piglet,
it's only a movie.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.583
It's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.375
It's only a m-m-movie.
It--

03:40.375 --> 03:41.875
What is it, Pooh?

03:41.875 --> 03:44.416
Hey, look, your guys.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.875
Refresh-a-ments.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.875
Wait here, Piglet.

03:50.875 --> 03:54.583
I'll be right back.

03:54.583 --> 03:57.375
Oh, boy. I hope
those guys hurry.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.250
We don't want to miss
the part of the movie

03:59.250 --> 04:01.875
where the monster
eats the whole city.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.083
The whole c-c-city?

04:04.083 --> 04:06.416
Oh, uh, perhaps we should
move to the country.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.083
Nah. It wouldn't matter.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.958
Sometimes movie monsters
eat whole countries

04:10.958 --> 04:13.083
and spit out the pits.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.875
They d-d-do?

04:14.875 --> 04:16.875
Oh, no!

04:16.875 --> 04:18.083
Ooh!

04:19.875 --> 04:22.875
Hey, guys,
here's all the stuff--

04:28.250 --> 04:31.708
Lose your popcorn, kid?

04:31.708 --> 04:34.333
I'm real sorry, Mr. Usher.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.583
This is a movie theater,
not a playground.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.625
Understand?

04:40.708 --> 04:41.958
Yes, sir.

04:55.458 --> 04:59.583
Oh, boy.
They call that a monster?

05:05.291 --> 05:06.875
spider!

05:08.208 --> 05:09.875
Oh, bother.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.458
Where have my
honey crunch bars gone to?

05:15.958 --> 05:19.291
Here, candy, candy, candy.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.458
Oh, Pooh, let me help you.

05:26.625 --> 05:29.375
Help! P-P-Pooh!

05:29.375 --> 05:32.166
The spider's
going to get me!

05:32.166 --> 05:34.833
Oh! Me!

05:34.833 --> 05:36.208
Spider web!

05:36.208 --> 05:39.375
Oh, there you are, Piglet.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.416
Hold tight.

05:41.416 --> 05:44.375
You'll be free as me
in a jiffy.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.250
- Whoops.
- Aah!

05:48.250 --> 05:49.708
Eee!

05:51.125 --> 05:55.208
Both: Christopher Robin!

05:55.208 --> 06:00.250
Now how'd you two get
so icky-sticky with gum?

06:00.250 --> 06:03.583
Oh. You mean
it wasn't the spider?

06:03.583 --> 06:06.875
Ah, Piglet,
the spider's not real.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.583
It's only a movie.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.875
It's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.416
It's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.875
Hey, Pooh boy,
let's change places

06:18.875 --> 06:20.958
so I can see your
half of the movie.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.500
Maybe it's scarier.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.583
All right, Tigger.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.333
Whaah!

06:32.250 --> 06:33.375
Yeee!

06:33.375 --> 06:36.000
Popcorn, Piglet?

06:39.458 --> 06:40.750
Piglet?

06:40.750 --> 06:44.458
Piglet,
why are you swimming

06:44.458 --> 06:45.583
in the popcorn?

06:45.583 --> 06:47.583
I don't mean to complain,

06:47.583 --> 06:51.416
but I'm afraid I'm scared.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.958
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.
Popcorn can't hurt you.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.416
Oh, no, Pooh.
It's the big monsters.

06:59.416 --> 07:02.583
I, uh, well...

07:02.583 --> 07:04.833
th-they don't like me.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.166
Aw.

07:06.166 --> 07:09.416
Birdzilla? That big spider?

07:09.416 --> 07:11.458
Are they bothering you?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.708
Why, they're the saddest
excuses for monsters

07:14.708 --> 07:17.333
that ever was.
Why, they're nothing.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.833
They ain't even real.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.625
They're n-not real?

07:20.625 --> 07:23.416
Ha ha ha! Of course not,
buddy boy.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.750
They're only shadows
on the screen.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.166
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:33.125 --> 07:35.250
Tigger: Well, I once
saw a monster pillage

07:35.250 --> 07:37.333
a house, a block,
an entire village.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.625
He ate until
he reached his fillage,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.458
but me, I stood right there.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.000
I've seen them
90 stories high.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.083
Seen ones that swim
and some that fly.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.000
But I never flinched
when they stomped by

07:48.000 --> 07:49.875
don't get scared

07:55.000 --> 07:56.875
Tigger: It's just a light
that shines real bright

07:56.875 --> 07:58.583
and bounces off a screen.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.458
to be scared

08:04.458 --> 08:07.583
with you

08:07.583 --> 08:08.875
Piglet: But what
about the usher?

08:08.875 --> 08:10.333
Pooh:
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.958
He's not in the movie.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.000
I've seen them rip,
I've seen them tear.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.291
I've seen them throw
things through the air.

08:16.291 --> 08:18.375
But I stood by without a care

08:18.375 --> 08:20.500
'cause Tiggers
don't get scared.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.625
It's just a bunch
of movie tricks

08:22.625 --> 08:25.000
to make you think
this thing exists.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.083
Tigger: A piece of film
is all it is.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.875
There's really nothing there.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.083
all right

08:31.083 --> 08:33.458
make-believe

08:33.458 --> 08:35.625
It's just a light
that shines real bright

08:35.625 --> 08:37.416
and bounces off a screen.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.625
No need a be scared
when a Tigger--

08:43.625 --> 08:45.000
Or Pooh.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.625
And don't forget
Christopher Robin, too.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.875
are here with you

08:53.625 --> 08:55.500
See you in
the Hundred Acre Woods!

08:55.500 --> 08:57.208
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

08:58.833 --> 09:01.416
Oh, boy. That was great!

09:01.416 --> 09:04.625
Hey, you guys,
remember that big spider?

09:07.458 --> 09:08.708
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

09:08.708 --> 09:11.000
Yeah. And Birdzilla.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Raah! Raah! Raahr! Raah!

09:15.000 --> 09:18.458
Hey, let's make
our own monster movie,

09:18.458 --> 09:21.250
a really scary one.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.708
S-S-Scarier
than the one we--

09:23.708 --> 09:26.500
-- just saw?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.416
Aw, it'll be
our movie, Piglet.

09:29.416 --> 09:32.000
There's nothing
to be scared of.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.416
,

09:33.416 --> 09:35.875
as long as it's only a movie.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.583
Christopher Robin,

09:40.583 --> 09:44.291
are you sure heroes always
wear white scarves?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.708
They do in the movies,
Pooh Bear.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.708
The white scarf
makes them heroes.

09:49.708 --> 09:50.875
Oof!

09:50.875 --> 09:53.458
You may be the hero
in this picture,

09:53.458 --> 09:54.875
buddy bear, ha ha,

09:54.875 --> 09:57.375
but I'm gonna be the monster.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.708
And, uh, and, uh,

09:58.708 --> 10:01.500
w-what sort of monster
might that be, Tigger?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.708
Ha ha ha ha! I'm not telling.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.250
It would ruin the surprise.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.625
Well, TTFN: ta-ta for now.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.166
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

10:15.875 --> 10:18.583
Christopher Robin,
may I play the part

10:18.583 --> 10:22.625
of the very small animal
who...hides under his bed?

10:22.625 --> 10:26.000
But we need you.
Don't we, Pooh?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.416
That's right.

10:27.416 --> 10:29.416
You have a part that's
even more important

10:29.416 --> 10:31.416
than--
than Tigger's monster.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.458
I do?

10:32.458 --> 10:34.000
Yes, Piglet.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.875
Although it's not quite
as important as the hero.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.166
It's still very important.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.625
Really?
Oh, what is it, Pooh?

10:42.625 --> 10:45.875
Uh, what is it,
Christopher Robin?

10:45.875 --> 10:47.583
You, Piglet,

10:47.583 --> 10:50.458
are the one who gets
chased by the monster.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.625
Oh, d-d-dear.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.458
Oh, boy!

11:06.458 --> 11:09.000
Just wait till those
guys get a load of this.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.708
It'll be so scary,

11:10.708 --> 11:12.500
people will come
from miles around

11:12.500 --> 11:14.166
just to run away.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.833
Mm-mm-mm!

11:15.833 --> 11:18.750
Behold the ultimate terror,

11:18.750 --> 11:22.125
the ugliest, scariest
thing in the world.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.833
A Vegebibble!

11:26.833 --> 11:28.250
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:38.333 --> 11:39.333
Mm.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.833
Ah.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.333
So tasty.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.458
Ah.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.291
Hey, what'cha doing, Rabbit?

12:02.083 --> 12:03.875
Ha ha. I wasn't eating it.

12:03.875 --> 12:06.416
Honest. I love my carrots.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.458
I won't ever do it again.
I won't ever do it--

12:08.458 --> 12:10.458
Say, what's the matter,
Rabbit?

12:10.458 --> 12:13.958
It's only me-- Tigger--
T-I-double Guh-Er.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.500
That spells "Tigger."

12:15.500 --> 12:18.250
That-- That's Tigger's voice!

12:18.250 --> 12:19.458
Aah!

12:19.458 --> 12:22.375
The giant carrot's
eaten Tigger!

12:22.375 --> 12:25.250
- Whooh!
- No. I'll show you.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.708
Hey, the zipper is stuck.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.416
Rabbit, will you--

12:37.708 --> 12:39.250
No, no, come back!

12:39.250 --> 12:41.458
Hey, help me
out of this thing!

12:41.458 --> 12:42.583
Hey!

12:42.583 --> 12:45.250
Hey!

12:49.208 --> 12:52.250
And...action.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.416
Oh, help.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.625
I will save you.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.583
Oh, help.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.250
I will save you.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.750
That's great.

13:05.750 --> 13:09.333
All right, Piglet,
now you run from the monster.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.250
Uh, Christopher Robin,
what monster?

13:16.250 --> 13:17.583
Help!

13:18.583 --> 13:20.083
Help!

13:21.375 --> 13:22.875
Help!

13:22.875 --> 13:25.083
Monster!

13:25.083 --> 13:27.083
- Hey! My film.
- Help!

13:27.083 --> 13:28.875
Monster!

13:28.875 --> 13:31.833
Orange Tigger! Giant Carrot!

13:31.833 --> 13:35.750
But, Rabbit, Tigger
doesn't even like carrots.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.291
- Aah!

13:38.291 --> 13:40.166
Aah!

13:40.166 --> 13:42.125
-

13:42.125 --> 13:43.625
Hi, guys.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.000
Say, can somebody
give me a hand?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.458
It's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.375
A monster!

13:52.375 --> 13:55.958
Oh, come on. Somebody
help me out of this thing.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.416
Pooh Bear.

14:03.416 --> 14:05.458
Piglet?

14:05.458 --> 14:07.750
Hey, where'd everybody go?

14:09.083 --> 14:11.375
Tigger: Hellooo!

14:11.375 --> 14:13.625
Rabbit: Quick, this way.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.166
Oof!

14:21.708 --> 14:24.208
In here. Hide.

14:24.208 --> 14:28.416
Tigger: Hey!
Where are you guys?

14:28.416 --> 14:29.500
Oof!

14:32.083 --> 14:34.416
Hellooo!

14:38.416 --> 14:42.125
Come on, guys, please!
I need help!

14:44.708 --> 14:47.333
Hellooo!

14:47.333 --> 14:49.000
Uh, P-P-Pooh,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.333
couldn't we do
something for Tigger?

14:51.333 --> 14:52.958
Piglet--

14:54.291 --> 14:56.250
you're right.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.875
Think, think. Think.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.458
All right, now remember,
when the carrot comes,

15:07.458 --> 15:11.208
you'll frighten him into
the hole with the cymbals.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.875
What?

15:13.875 --> 15:17.500
You'll scare the carrot
into the hole!

15:17.500 --> 15:21.250
Okay, okay. Ne need to yell.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.625
And, uh, what shall I do
with this honey pot, Pooh?

15:24.625 --> 15:27.375
When the carrot
falls into the hole,

15:27.375 --> 15:29.958
you'll pour the honey
all over it.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.833
Not too much, of course.

15:34.833 --> 15:39.250
And then I'll save Tigger
with this.

15:39.250 --> 15:42.250
Ooh, good idea,
buddy boy,

15:42.250 --> 15:44.291
but it won't do much
with a stuck zipper.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.125
Ooh! The monster!

15:46.125 --> 15:48.416
Uh, Pooh Bear, how
am I supposed to know

15:48.416 --> 15:51.125
when to scare it? I can't
hear a thing, Pooh Bear.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.625
Come on, Pooh boy,
quit fooling around.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.166
I'm stuck! You got to get me
out of here! Help!

16:03.166 --> 16:05.125
The honey, Piglet!

16:05.125 --> 16:07.500
Use the honey!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.250
Piglet!

16:10.708 --> 16:12.083
Help!

16:12.083 --> 16:14.500
Someone save Pooh!

16:16.125 --> 16:19.458
I don't want honey!
I want to get out of here!

16:22.458 --> 16:23.958
- That's my tail.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.333
Piglet: What did you say?

16:27.291 --> 16:28.833
Help! Help!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.291
Oh, my.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.500
It's not moving.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.375
Good. Let's bury it
before it wakes up.

16:43.375 --> 16:47.083
Hey! You're getting
my costume all dirty.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.000
Costume?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.625
C-C-Costume?

16:51.625 --> 16:54.166
Yeah.
It was my scary costume

16:54.166 --> 16:57.000
for Christopher Robin's
movie.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.416
Why--
Why, so it is.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.000
It's only a costume.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.833
It's only a costume.

17:05.833 --> 17:06.833
Oh ho ho!

17:16.000 --> 17:17.583
You see, Piglet?

17:17.583 --> 17:20.458
It wasn't a monster. It w--

17:20.458 --> 17:22.166
Oh.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.583
Piglet?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.000
Why, Piglet, what's wrong?

17:28.166 --> 17:30.458
Oh, nothing, Pooh.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.125
You're a hero.
You-- You saved us.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.708
--

17:35.708 --> 17:38.333
I was too scared to help you.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.333
Oh, we were
all scared, Piglet.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.500
But it's all right now.

17:43.500 --> 17:47.125
No, Pooh. When I thought
you were in danger,

17:47.125 --> 17:49.458
I couldn't even help you.

17:49.458 --> 17:52.583
No one needs a friend
who's always afraid.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.250
It's only a costume,
and I let it scare me.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Piglet!

18:22.000 --> 18:24.583
Are you home?

18:24.583 --> 18:27.166
I brought you
a cheering up present:

18:27.166 --> 18:29.250
my hero scarf.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.083
Thank you, Pooh,
but-- --

18:31.083 --> 18:32.833
I'm no hero.

18:32.833 --> 18:34.833
But Christopher Robin
said

18:34.833 --> 18:37.458
this scarf would
make you a hero.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.416
Remember?

18:39.416 --> 18:43.750
No, Pooh. Not only
am I a very small animal,

18:43.750 --> 18:46.750
I'm a worthless, no-good,
can't-even-save-my-best-friend

18:46.750 --> 18:48.458
type of animal.

18:48.458 --> 18:52.125
You don't want to be
friends with a fraidy cat.

18:52.125 --> 18:55.375
Goodbye, Pooh Bear.

19:06.958 --> 19:10.000
Oh, my poor friend Piglet.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.458
I shall have to get
Christopher Robin's advice

19:12.458 --> 19:13.750
for cheering him up.

19:13.750 --> 19:17.458
It was only a costume,
after all.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.000
Help!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.500
Oh, help!

19:25.500 --> 19:29.375
Help, Piglet! Help!

19:29.375 --> 19:30.875
Pooh Bear!

19:30.875 --> 19:34.750
Piglet! Piglet! Piglet!

19:35.750 --> 19:37.125
Whoa!

19:37.125 --> 19:41.708
Tigger! Rabbit!
Christopher Robin!

19:41.708 --> 19:43.625
The Hero Scarf.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.000
I'll save you, Pooh Bear!

19:50.166 --> 19:51.458
Whoops.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.416
Oh, d-d-dear.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.000
If you wouldn't mind
terribly, M-M-Mr. Monster,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.208
could you please let go
of my best friend Pooh?

20:07.208 --> 20:08.458
Whoa!

20:09.875 --> 20:13.250
Piglet. You saved me.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.708
I did?

20:14.708 --> 20:18.000
Yes, Piglet.
You're a real hero.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.458
I am?

20:19.458 --> 20:21.000
Oh, yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.875
Just wait till everyone
hears about this.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.000
Raah!

20:27.000 --> 20:30.291
Christopher Robin:
Psst. Pooh, you're on.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.375
Oh, help. Oh, help.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.708
Oh, help!

20:41.083 --> 20:43.208
I'll save you, Pooh.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.416
Now, Mr. Monster,

20:47.416 --> 20:49.083
you leave my friend alone.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.291
I ain't never dressing up

20:55.291 --> 20:57.083
in anything bigger
than myself again.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.833
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

20:58.833 --> 21:00.458
- Hooray!

21:00.458 --> 21:02.166
Hooray for Piglet!

21:02.166 --> 21:03.208
Splendid.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.583
Oh, my. Wonderful!

21:04.583 --> 21:05.875
Hurray!

21:05.875 --> 21:08.708
Here's a real hero.

21:08.708 --> 21:12.583
Ah, it was only a movie.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.958
Well...

21:22.958 --> 21:26.458
I suppose we don't have to be
afraid of carrots anymore.

21:26.458 --> 21:30.958
Not after
the brave thing Piglet did.

21:30.958 --> 21:34.833
Yeah, but Mom's got
a freezer full of broccoli

21:34.833 --> 21:37.416
waiting to invade
tomorrow's dinner.

21:38.416 --> 21:40.625
Uh, Christopher Robin,

21:40.625 --> 21:43.333
if it's all the same
to you,

21:43.333 --> 21:46.208
could we skip dinner--
--

21:46.208 --> 21:47.958
and have breakfast instead?

21:47.958 --> 21:50.458
Silly old bear.
