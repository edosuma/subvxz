00:11.533 --> 00:14.434

CAN YOU DO THIS?

00:14.534 --> 00:15.810
YOU CAN DO IT!
COME ON!

00:15.910 --> 00:17.186
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL LEO.

00:17.286 --> 00:18.534
NO. WE CAN STILL
MAKE THIS PLAN WORK.

00:19.536 --> 00:23.062
SEEMS ALMOST ANTI-CLIMACTIC

00:23.162 --> 00:25.271
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

00:25.371 --> 00:26.437
DOESN'T IT?

00:26.537 --> 00:28.829
SAY HELLO TO PRUE FOR ME.

01:08.003 --> 01:11.543
WELL,
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

01:12.212 --> 01:15.363
I SAW...

01:15.463 --> 01:18.488
YOUR DEMISE.

01:18.588 --> 01:20.088
MY DEMISE?
THAT CANNOT BE.

01:20.545 --> 01:23.298
YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL
MY VISIONS ARE,

01:24.298 --> 01:26.989
MORE SO EVEN THAN
THE ORACLE'S WERE

01:27.089 --> 01:29.531
AND MORE ACCURATE.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.548
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

01:33.132 --> 01:36.133
THAT WITH ALL THE POWERS
AT MY DISPOSAL,ALL I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT THEM,

01:37.548 --> 01:39.991
IN THE END
I STILL LOSE?

01:40.091 --> 01:42.076
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

01:42.176 --> 01:44.076
THE CHARMED ONES' POWER

01:44.176 --> 01:45.633
MUST SIMPLY
BE GREATER THAN YOURS.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.218
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.619
I ONLY SPEAK OF WHAT I SEE.

01:52.719 --> 01:55.577
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO CHANGE WHAT YOU SEE

01:55.677 --> 01:57.551
IS TO OBTAIN
MORE POWER.

01:57.719 --> 01:59.678
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.912
BUT THAT'S FORBIDDEN.

02:03.012 --> 02:05.221
THE HOLLOW HAS BEEN
BANISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.

02:06.388 --> 02:08.663

02:08.763 --> 02:10.554
WE ALL COULD DIE.

02:11.805 --> 02:13.331
IF I DON'T PREVAIL,

02:13.431 --> 02:14.331
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

02:14.431 --> 02:15.830
THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY.

02:15.931 --> 02:17.706
NO!

02:17.806 --> 02:19.374
WITH THE HOLLOW,

02:19.474 --> 02:20.498
I WILL RENDER
THE WITCHES POWERLESS,

THEN I WILL
DESTROY THEM,

02:22.724 --> 02:25.475
EVEN IF IT MEANS
DESTROYING US ALL.

03:55.407 --> 03:59.015
DO I REALLY NEED
TO THINK ABOUT THIS NOW?

03:59.115 --> 04:00.472
YES.
WHY?

04:00.572 --> 04:02.225
BECAUSE THE SOURCE
HAS ALREADY KILLED ONE OF US.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.392
AND IF, GOD FORBID,
IT HAPPENS AGAIN,

04:04.492 --> 04:06.225
WE WANT TO BE PREPARED.

04:06.325 --> 04:07.809

THAT IF WE DON'T MAKE IT,

PHOEBE HAS SOMETHING
SHE'D LIKE TO SAY

04:27.995 --> 04:29.477

AFFECT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT HERE.

THANK YOU, HONEY.

04:31.497 --> 04:32.573
WE NAILED THE SOURCE

04:32.583 --> 04:34.646

04:34.746 --> 04:36.479
THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE MISSING.

04:36.579 --> 04:37.479
IF WE CAN DRAW THE MAGIC

04:37.579 --> 04:38.522
FROM THE ENTIRE

04:38.622 --> 04:40.106
WE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO VANQUISH THE SOURCE.

YES.

04:42.956 --> 04:44.065
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS MIGHT WORK.

I'LL GO TELL THE ELDERS.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.065

GONNA START A FAMILY.

05:41.679 --> 05:43.741
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT A WILL.

05:43.841 --> 05:45.117

05:45.217 --> 05:47.410
THAT I DON'T WANT
COLE TO KNOW ABOUT.

05:47.510 --> 05:48.909
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHY NOT?

I LOST CUSTODY OF MY SON

06:54.395 --> 06:55.597
THAT YOU WEREN'T IN
AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

OR THAT YOU
DIDN'T GO TO REHAB.

06:57.105 --> 06:58.671

THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

07:13.023 --> 07:16.507
THE JUDGE JUST CARES
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE,

07:16.607 --> 07:19.507
NOT ABOUT WHO YOU WERE.

OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

07:33.569 --> 07:34.802
DOES A HALF-FACED DEMON
QUALIFY AS IMPORTANT?

07:34.902 --> 07:37.636
HE'S THERE NOW?
NO.

07:37.736 --> 07:39.387
WELL, THEN, NO,
THAT DOESN'T QUALIFY.

IS TOO GREAT.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.188
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE KIND OF POWER...

11:07.772 --> 11:11.022

12:08.533 --> 12:11.641
NO! PLEASE DON'T!

12:11.741 --> 12:14.184

CONSUMES POWERS!

TO CONSUME POWERS...

12:25.994 --> 12:29.495
AND GIVE THEM TO ME.

12:29.870 --> 12:33.560
SO WE FOUND A DEMON
WITH HALF A BODY,

12:33.660 --> 12:36.561
BUT NO DEMON
WITH HALF A FACE.

12:36.661 --> 12:38.729
WELL, WE DO HAVE

12:38.829 --> 12:40.116
A RESIDENT DEMONOLOGIST
LIVING IN THE HOUSE.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.355
YEAH. WE'VE HAD
THAT CONVERSATION.

12:42.455 --> 12:44.439
ALL RIGHT...

12:44.539 --> 12:45.830

AND I'LL GO
GET SOME COFFEE.

13:19.794 --> 13:21.669

13:23.045 --> 13:24.129
PHOEBE!

13:38.381 --> 13:41.573
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

13:41.673 --> 13:44.048
SHE ALMOST DIED,
THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG.

13:45.799 --> 13:46.673
Leo: EASY, EASY.

13:49.216 --> 13:52.117
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:52.217 --> 13:53.326
ONE VERY MEAN DEMON.

13:53.426 --> 13:56.574
AND DID YOU GET HIM?

13:56.675 --> 13:57.801
YES. BUT, UH,
SOMETHING ELSE GOT AWAY.

13:59.675 --> 14:02.869
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

14:02.969 --> 14:04.303
THROW THIS.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.553
JUST DO IT.

14:11.637 --> 14:14.788
MY POWERS ARE GONE.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.388
IT STOLE YOUR POWERS?

14:18.305 --> 14:19.578
STOLE, ATE, ABSORBED,
I DON'T KNOW.

14:19.678 --> 14:21.997
THE ONLY THING I DO KNOW

14:22.097 --> 14:22.997
IS THAT I GOTTA
GET THEM BACK.

14:23.097 --> 14:25.206
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:25.306 --> 14:26.664
WE VANQUISH A DEMON

14:26.764 --> 14:27.873
AND THEN
LOSE OUR POWERS?

14:27.973 --> 14:29.290
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

14:29.390 --> 14:30.675
THAT THING
MUST HAVE ABSORBED
YOUR POWER SOMEHOW,

14:30.685 --> 14:32.581
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW.

14:32.681 --> 14:33.974
OH. WELL, WITH THE
SOURCE LURKING AROUND...

14:34.724 --> 14:36.681
THAT'S HIM.

14:38.058 --> 14:39.875
THIS IS HIM.

14:39.975 --> 14:42.084

14:42.184 --> 14:43.918
RING ANY BELLS?

14:44.018 --> 14:45.583
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

14:45.683 --> 14:46.583
WHY NOT? WHAT IS IT?

14:46.683 --> 14:48.583
BECAUSE A HOLLOW
IS SOMETHING

14:48.683 --> 14:49.679
THAT CONSUMES ALL MAGIC,
GOOD OR EVIL,

14:49.689 --> 14:51.044
AND BOTH SIDES
AGREE TO GUARD IT.

14:51.144 --> 14:52.584
AND THAT THING
MUST HAVE BEEN THE HOLLOW.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.002
IT MUST HAVE
TAKEN OVER THE DEMON.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.585
WELL, THEN, HOW DO WE
GET IT TO REGURGITATE?

14:55.685 --> 14:57.337
HMM.
THERE IS NO MENTION
OF A VANQUISH HERE.

14:57.437 --> 15:00.585
YOU CAN'T VANQUISH IT.

15:00.685 --> 15:02.338
THE LAST TIME
IT WAS UNLEASHED,

15:02.438 --> 15:04.171
IT NEARLY DECIMATED
ALL MAGIC,

15:04.271 --> 15:06.088
ALL THINGS.

15:06.188 --> 15:07.587
THE LAST TIME
IT WAS UNLEASHED?

15:07.687 --> 15:09.130
EONS AGO, GOOD AND EVIL
HAD TO JOIN FORCES

15:09.230 --> 15:12.588
AND USE
THEIR STRONGEST MAGIC.

15:12.688 --> 15:14.173
AND EVEN THEN,
ALL THEY COULD DO
WAS CONTAIN IT.

15:14.273 --> 15:16.048
OK, SO IF GOOD AND EVIL
ARE SEEING EYE-TO-EYE
ON THIS ONE,

15:16.148 --> 15:19.589
WHO LET IT OUT?

15:19.689 --> 15:20.689
THE SOURCE.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.524
IF HE WAS DESPERATE ENOUGH.

15:24.525 --> 15:26.217
WHICH MEANS HE WON'T STOP
AT JUST MY POWERS,

15:26.317 --> 15:30.067
HE'S GONNA SEND ANOTHER
DEMON FOR YOURS AND PAIGE'S.

15:31.651 --> 15:33.734

WITH THE HALF A FACE,

15:35.193 --> 15:36.511

15:36.611 --> 15:37.687
WELL, EVEN IF
SHE COULD USE HER POWERS,

15:37.697 --> 15:39.219
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO,
BECAUSE HE'D JUST STEAL THEM.

15:39.319 --> 15:41.010
THEN HOW DO WE STOP HIM?

15:41.110 --> 15:42.677
WE'LL USE POTIONS INSTEAD.

15:42.777 --> 15:45.345
I'LL MAKE ONE TO REPLICATE
MY EXPLODING POWER.

BETTER GET PAIGE.

SABOTAGE THIS,

SO CLOSE TO GETTING
HER SON BACK.

COME TO US
AND SETTLE HERE."

36:49.203 --> 36:52.437
OH, MY GOD!

36:52.537 --> 36:54.328
NOT QUITE.

37:02.912 --> 37:06.247
I HAVE YOUR POWERS NOW!

37:09.081 --> 37:12.290
PIPER!

37:19.999 --> 37:23.500
HURRY. HE'S COMING!

37:24.916 --> 37:27.942
COME ON, HONEY.

37:28.042 --> 37:28.942
WE NEED YOU, PIPER,
IT'S TIME.

37:29.042 --> 37:30.527
COME ON,
YOU CAN DO IT.

37:30.627 --> 37:32.068
DO WHAT?
WE HAVE NO POWERS!

37:32.168 --> 37:33.569
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE CAN STILL MAKE
THE PLAN WORK.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.918
GET THE CRYSTALS.

37:38.586 --> 37:41.903
SEEMS ALMOST
ANTICLIMACTIC

37:42.003 --> 37:44.696
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

37:44.796 --> 37:46.279
DOESN'T IT?

37:46.379 --> 37:47.755
UHH!

37:49.505 --> 37:51.338
PIPER.

37:52.713 --> 37:54.756
SAY HELLO TO PRUE FOR ME.

38:00.841 --> 38:03.922
PHOEBE!

38:08.341 --> 38:11.825
YOUR POWER WAS
ALWAYS THE WEAKEST,

38:11.925 --> 38:14.034
HARDLY WORTH TAKING.

38:14.134 --> 38:15.825
YOUR LIFE, HOWEVER, IS.

38:15.925 --> 38:19.160
PAIGE, NOW!

38:19.260 --> 38:21.468
GOT HIM!

38:25.926 --> 38:29.095
CRYSTAL.

38:31.927 --> 38:35.721
NOW THE MOMENT
WE'VE ALL BEEN
WAITING FOR.

38:40.929 --> 38:44.097
COLE!

38:45.682 --> 38:45.930
BELTHAZOR?!

38:48.930 --> 38:50.707
NO.

38:50.807 --> 38:53.307
THE HOLLOW.

38:53.931 --> 38:54.931
HURRY! THE SPELL!

38:57.475 --> 38:58.932
PRUDENCE, PATRICIA,
PENELOPE, MELINDA.

39:01.142 --> 39:04.126
ASTRID, HELENA,
LAURA, AND GRACE.

39:04.226 --> 39:05.833
HALLIWELL WITCHES
STAND STRONG BESIDE US.

39:05.933 --> 39:08.560
All: VANQUISH THIS EVIL
FROM TIME AND SPACE.

39:11.934 --> 39:14.935
AAH!

39:27.937 --> 39:30.963
WHO ARE YOU?

39:31.063 --> 39:32.272
SOMEONE WHO JUST HELPED
SAVE YOUR LIVES.

39:37.981 --> 39:41.049
OHH.

39:41.149 --> 39:43.939
AAH!

39:47.191 --> 39:50.734
QUICKLY, TAKE MY HAND!

39:51.443 --> 39:52.818
TRUST HER...

39:54.776 --> 39:56.235
IF YOU WANT
YOUR POWERS BACK.

40:03.528 --> 40:06.886
SAY THE INSCRIPTION
WITH ME.

40:06.986 --> 40:09.679
Both: <i>"ABOLEO
EXTIUM CAVIUM.</i>

40:09.779 --> 40:11.944
<i>DU ETERNIAS."</i>

40:39.909 --> 40:43.393
I CAN'T DO IT.
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

40:43.493 --> 40:45.769
HOLD HIS HAND.

40:45.869 --> 40:46.950
LET HIS POWER TO HEAL
FLOW THROUGH YOU.

40:54.952 --> 40:58.187
PAIGE, PHOEBE.

40:58.287 --> 41:00.121
HA HA!

41:01.329 --> 41:02.872
I DID IT.
IT WORKED.

41:04.788 --> 41:04.953
LEO!

41:08.414 --> 41:09.831
ALL IS AS
IT SHOULD BE AGAIN.

41:11.955 --> 41:15.065
TIME TO RETURN
TO MY SIDE.

41:15.165 --> 41:18.441
TOO BAD
BELTHAZOR'S GONE.

41:18.541 --> 41:19.833
HE WOULD'VE MADE
A GREAT NEW SOURCE.

41:21.249 --> 41:24.400
TOO BAD.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.857
Phoebe: I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

41:25.957 --> 41:27.858
BUT WHOEVER YOU ARE,
WE THANK YOU.

41:27.958 --> 41:30.585
OH, I DIDN'T DO THIS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

41:30.751 --> 41:33.859
I DID IT FOR MINE.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.859
Paige:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41:35.959 --> 41:37.586
IF WE GOT OUR POWERS BACK,
WHERE DID THE SOURCE'S GO?

41:38.959 --> 41:40.419
INTO THE VOID.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.529
OK, WHO WAS THAT?

41:47.629 --> 41:50.446
A VERY EVIL PERSON.

41:50.546 --> 41:52.946
YEAH, ONE THAT
SAVED OUR LIVES

41:53.046 --> 41:55.797
AND HELPED US
KILL THE SOURCE.

42:04.382 --> 42:07.964
ALRIGHT. HERE YOU GO. ENJOY.

42:09.299 --> 42:10.175
[LAUGHS]

42:12.550 --> 42:14.784
HERE YOU GO, GUYS,
ON THE HOUSE.

42:14.884 --> 42:16.866
OH, EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

42:16.966 --> 42:18.866
YEAH. WELL, WE
DESERVE TO CELEBRATE.

42:18.966 --> 42:20.866
YOU KNOW, I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

42:20.966 --> 42:21.963
YOU GUYS ACTUALLY
VANQUISHED
THE SOURCE.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.494
SO, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IS OUR DESTINY FULFILLED?

42:24.594 --> 42:27.535
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT AT LEAST THAT PART

42:27.636 --> 42:29.787
OF THE NIGHTMARE'S OVER.

42:29.887 --> 42:30.968
FOR PRUE.

42:32.969 --> 42:34.179
FOR PRUE.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.996
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO HOME

42:40.096 --> 42:41.747
AND GET STARTED
ON OUR FUTURE?

42:41.847 --> 42:43.413
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO HOME AND SLEEP

42:43.513 --> 42:45.723
AND WE WORK
ON THAT FUTURE
TOMORROW NIGHT?

42:48.222 --> 42:49.014
PHOEBE: HI, HONEY.
ARE YOU OK?

42:51.973 --> 42:55.290
YEAH. YEAH, WHY?

42:55.390 --> 42:56.873
WELL, IT JUST TOOK YOU
A WHILE TO GET BACK.

42:56.973 --> 42:58.873
IT DID?
MM-HMM.

42:58.973 --> 43:01.458
Paige: YOU KNOW,

43:01.558 --> 43:02.874
FACING DEATH
HAS KIND OF MADE ME
WANT TO FACE LIFE.

43:02.974 --> 43:04.125
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

43:04.225 --> 43:05.376
THERE'S A PIECE
OF LIFE OVER THERE

43:05.476 --> 43:06.874
THAT I THINK
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO.

43:06.974 --> 43:08.875
HMM, YOU GO
GET HIM, GIRL.

43:08.975 --> 43:10.794
WOOF!

43:10.894 --> 43:12.268
YOU SURE YOU'RE OK?

43:14.059 --> 43:15.169
YEAH, YEAH. I'M JUST
A LITTLE, UH, TIRED.

43:15.269 --> 43:17.876
TOO TIRED TO CELEBRATE?

43:17.976 --> 43:20.770
YOU ARE MY
SOON-TO-BE HUSBAND.

43:20.977 --> 43:23.961
[CHUCKLES]

43:24.061 --> 43:26.354
AND YOU'RE ALSO MY HERO.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.271
OH, I'M NOBODY'S HERO.
