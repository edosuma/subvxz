00:00.884 --> 00:03.816
<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:03.884 --> 00:07.018
There is one
whom Prime seems to respect.

00:07.087 --> 00:10.051
Dreadwing, there is another path.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.552
Is there a point to your bluster, Prime?

00:12.621 --> 00:16.126
The download of the Iacon
database may have been incomplete,

00:16.268 --> 00:19.751
but we now possess four sets
of coordinates decoded by the ship.

00:19.820 --> 00:23.083
If we are to have any hope of
recovering the Iacon relics

00:23.152 --> 00:27.583
before the Decepticons do,
we must divide our resources.

00:27.651 --> 00:32.448
But, Optimus, when it comes to numbers,
we are already at a grave disadvantage.

00:32.517 --> 00:35.382
Dispatching multiple
squadrons will enable us to pursue

00:35.450 --> 00:37.917
all four coordinates simultaneously.

00:37.985 --> 00:40.884
Triangulate coordinates of
the other three relics.

00:40.952 --> 00:46.720
This is one race that we
absolutely cannot afford to lose.

00:47.101 --> 00:48.955
<b>2x13 - Triangulation</b>

00:50.149 --> 00:54.111
The coordinates indicate that
the second of these four Iacon

00:54.183 --> 00:57.958
relics lies at the very
bottom of this world.

00:58.026 --> 01:02.926
I will journey to the ends of this or
any world to serve your will, lord Megatron.

01:02.994 --> 01:04.760
Then return with my prize,

01:04.828 --> 01:08.027
Dreadwing, and prove you are
more worthy of being my

01:08.095 --> 01:12.728
second-in-command
than those who have preceded you.

01:13.096 --> 01:18.630
Inner stat, cross clamp,
laser scalpel, durabyllium drill,

01:18.699 --> 01:27.603
and one slightly damaged but operational
T-cog, courtesy of my traitorous clone ...

01:27.671 --> 01:34.374
everything I require
to make myself whole.

01:34.443 --> 01:38.143
A simple, painless procedure.

01:40.747 --> 01:45.314
Nothing to it, really, provided
one possesses the nerve.

01:53.455 --> 01:57.255
Four detachments of Decepticons
ground-bridging to four

01:57.324 --> 02:01.525
different continents at the
exact same time?

02:01.594 --> 02:05.894
Ah.
Procedure postponed.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.131
Be on your guard, Bulkhead. 

02:46.200 --> 02:49.402
Raphael, lock on to the
remaining coordinates.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.606
I will embark for the Antarctic.

02:55.609 --> 03:00.413
As for you, old friend, I would prefer
that you have company on your mission.

03:00.482 --> 03:02.950
No one is left to join me, Optimus.

03:03.018 --> 03:06.020
Even if Agent Fowler were alert...

03:10.226 --> 03:11.959
He's human.

03:12.028 --> 03:17.631
I was considering the only remaining
Autobot alternative on this planet.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.067
But ... you can't be serious.

03:20.136 --> 03:26.006
Wheeljack is insubordinate, a ruffian.
Besides, he's Bulkhead's partner.

03:26.075 --> 03:31.110
Your expertise is scientific, but
Wheeljack is a highly capable warrior.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.647
You would be wise
to welcome the temporary alliance.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.509
I despise this planet.

04:03.578 --> 04:07.880
If it isn't a scorching desert,
it is a frigid wasteland.

04:07.948 --> 04:12.718
Now, where are you,
my Decepticon brethren?

04:33.872 --> 04:37.973
Faster, you pathetic
excuse for transportation!

04:49.888 --> 04:56.293
Decepticons, do you not realize you have
just shot down your ship's Commander?!

04:57.096 --> 05:00.030
You command no one, deserter.

05:00.099 --> 05:02.567
Skyquake?
B-but you're ...

05:02.635 --> 05:06.104
You mistake me for my
brother, who is one with the

05:06.173 --> 05:12.510
Allspark, as you are, no doubt, aware,
former commander Starscream.

05:15.383 --> 05:21.120
Were it up to me,
I would end this here and now.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.859
But it is my duty as
first lieutenant to Megatron

05:27.928 --> 05:32.563
to render all traitors to my
lord and master for due punishment.

05:32.632 --> 05:36.900
First lieutenant?!
That's my post!

05:39.271 --> 05:42.905
Uh, was my post.

05:46.843 --> 05:50.679
Commander Dreadwing, this
must be a very important mission

05:50.748 --> 05:55.017
if Megatron has dispatched his
second-in-command.

05:55.085 --> 05:59.021
Scouting for Energon,
or something else altogether?

05:59.089 --> 06:01.156
That is none of your concern.

06:01.225 --> 06:05.527
If I knew what you were
looking for, perhaps I could help.

06:05.596 --> 06:08.830
Oh!

06:08.899 --> 06:13.268
We have arrived at the coordinates.

06:13.337 --> 06:17.272
The relic.
It has been taken.

06:17.340 --> 06:19.741
Relic?
What sort of relic?

06:19.809 --> 06:21.709
Search the area!

06:29.785 --> 06:33.421
Commander Dreadwing,
we have discovered vehicle tracks.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.556
The Autobots.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.693
Perhaps.
Though I've never known them to

06:38.762 --> 06:42.197
plant flags at the
site of their victories.

06:42.265 --> 06:44.232
Do not try me, traitor.

06:44.301 --> 06:48.303
I will leave your lifeless husk
in this frozen waste.

06:54.944 --> 06:56.478
Ooh!

06:56.546 --> 06:58.914
You two, guard the prisoner.

07:08.023 --> 07:14.262
Optimus Prime, I will request only once
that you surrender the relic.

07:14.331 --> 07:17.900
I was going to request the
same of you, Dreadwing.

07:17.968 --> 07:22.205
Then I would say that we are
on equal footing, were it not

07:22.273 --> 07:27.144
that there are five of us
and only one of you.

07:27.212 --> 07:31.382
Six, if you'd relieve me
of these ridiculous manacles.

09:32.861 --> 09:34.695
Your aim is poor.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.736
That is a matter of perspective.

09:45.175 --> 09:47.042
<i>No!</i>

09:54.716 --> 09:58.185
A stalemate would leave us where?

10:03.924 --> 10:05.792
Commander Dreadwing!

10:29.887 --> 10:31.688
What a team we make!

10:31.757 --> 10:35.626
I am so glad that you
prevailed, Optimus Prime!

10:35.694 --> 10:38.996
That wretch Dreadwing
was going to terminate me.

10:39.065 --> 10:44.335
Now, if you could just remove my bonds,
I can lead you straight to the relic.

10:46.973 --> 10:50.509
You will lead me there regardless.

10:50.578 --> 10:53.879
Hmph. You're welcome.

11:02.457 --> 11:07.728
Be reasonable, Prime! This cold
will freeze both our actuators.

11:07.797 --> 11:12.031
The current temperatures are not
extreme enough to affect our biology.

11:12.100 --> 11:16.268
- You'll be fine.
- Fine but miserable.

11:16.337 --> 11:19.971
And I cannot believe that you
take our alliances for granted.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.309
After all I have done for the
Autobots ... helping to restore

11:24.377 --> 11:27.912
your memory, saving Arcee's life.

11:27.981 --> 11:31.483
While you have at times
proved beneficial to us, it has

11:31.551 --> 11:34.553
been only to further your own interests.

11:34.621 --> 11:39.491
Well, we can't all be as
selfless as you, now, can we?

11:55.075 --> 12:00.381
Aha, as I suspected ... humans.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.251
We will find the relic here.

12:03.320 --> 12:07.588
So, let us reclaim
what is rightfully ours. 

12:07.657 --> 12:12.326
We cannot simply enter a human
facility to search for cybertronian relics.

12:12.395 --> 12:14.695
Not even if they stole it?

12:14.764 --> 12:19.367
Nor can I expose innocent
humans to a dangerous Decepticon.

12:20.337 --> 12:23.472
Rafael, has Agent Fowler
regained consciousness?

12:23.540 --> 12:26.175
I'm here, Prime.
What's your situation?

12:26.243 --> 12:30.545
I require access to a research
facility at my current coordinates.

12:30.614 --> 12:31.980
<i>Let me make a call.</i>

13:17.391 --> 13:21.126
Are we really going to wait
out here in the freezing cold,

13:21.195 --> 13:24.629
completely at the mercy
of human bureaucracy?!

13:35.675 --> 13:38.644
<i>Base is clear, Prime.
Try not to wreck the joint.</i>

13:38.712 --> 13:41.191
Many thanks, Agent Fowler.

13:55.609 --> 13:58.232
The relic remained sealed in the ice.

13:58.301 --> 14:03.071
I knew you were of
questionable honor, Starscream,

14:03.140 --> 14:07.742
but aiding the Autobots,
that is a capital offense.

14:07.811 --> 14:11.279
What?!
But I ... I left tracks for you

14:11.348 --> 14:15.950
on purpose, so you could
rescue me from my captor.

14:16.019 --> 14:21.055
Dreadwing, I cannot allow you
to leave here with this relic.

14:21.124 --> 14:26.961
I know that, Prime, but I do
not intend to give you a choice.

14:33.401 --> 14:35.702
Hmm.

14:35.771 --> 14:44.843
Given all the fuss,
this relic must be truly special.

15:03.363 --> 15:11.002
Armor... of Decepticon origin.

15:44.137 --> 15:46.272
The Apex armor.

15:52.078 --> 15:55.580
A perfect fit.

16:06.053 --> 16:11.692
You dare to claim that which
rightfully belongs to Lord Megatron?

16:13.329 --> 16:18.399
And what do you intend to do
about it, Commander?

16:29.345 --> 16:32.413
Not so big and strong now, are you?

16:32.482 --> 16:40.688
I haven't had this much fun
since I punched that hole in Cliffjumper.

16:40.756 --> 16:45.860
Allow me to reunite you
with your beloved twin.

16:51.767 --> 16:56.237
And you, Optimus Prime.

16:56.306 --> 17:00.541
I will beat the living Spark out of you
just so I never again

17:00.610 --> 17:06.448
have to endure your pontificating.

17:17.527 --> 17:21.496
Dreadwing, our battle
remains unfinished, but if we do not

17:21.565 --> 17:23.565
unite against our common foe...

17:23.634 --> 17:27.836
Starscream will destroy us both.

17:31.174 --> 17:33.807
I will draw his attention.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.537
Might beats flight.

18:07.845 --> 18:13.082
You shall be the one
to join with the Allspark.

18:35.510 --> 18:37.255
That tickled!

18:39.256 --> 18:46.285
Fools! Not only am I intelligent,
I am invincible!

18:46.354 --> 18:51.300
- Yet you cannot fly.
- Nobody's perfect.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.199
Now, tell me of the other three relics.

18:59.268 --> 19:05.239
Are they as powerful
as my shiny new armor?

19:05.308 --> 19:10.878
They were hidden away precisely to
keep them from the hands of those like you.

19:16.353 --> 19:21.688
He is far too powerful, Prime!
Fall back!

19:21.757 --> 19:23.933
Cowards.

19:27.274 --> 19:30.463
You will not escape my might.

19:30.532 --> 19:35.434
Wait.
You two are up to something.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.736
Now that our alliance has
served its purpose...

20:06.804 --> 20:11.407
Starscream is gone
and the Apex armor with him.

20:11.476 --> 20:15.912
Is there really a need to renew
battle when the goal has been lost?

20:15.980 --> 20:20.016
We have other unfinished matters.

20:20.085 --> 20:25.279
I bore Skyquake no malice,
and I regret the role I played in his demise,

20:25.461 --> 20:28.758
so I will appeal to you
as I once did your twin...

20:28.827 --> 20:33.262
turn your back on the
Decepticon cause and help me end

20:33.331 --> 20:37.499
this war, for his sake
and for all who have fallen.

20:48.111 --> 20:51.648
You saved my life today.

20:52.716 --> 20:57.421
I will terminate you
the next time we meet.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.526
So be it, Dreadwing.
