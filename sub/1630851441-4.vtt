WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:10.051
-Is everything okay?
-The less you know, the better.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.803
Previously on
"The Lost Symbol..."

00:12.846 --> 00:15.557
(coughing)

00:15.598 --> 00:17.600
* *

00:19.394 --> 00:20.979
SATO:
Three years ago, Zachary Solomon

00:21.021 --> 00:23.398
-was beaten to death.
-So, what's the connection?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.566
That's what you're going
to Turkey to find out.

00:24.607 --> 00:27.652
I was there with him in the end.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.237
Mal'akh made it very clear
that he wants me

00:29.279 --> 00:30.488
doing this on my own.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.700
-To the mind-body connection.
-Cheers.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.873
* *

00:48.131 --> 00:51.092
(horns honking)

00:51.134 --> 00:53.345
(indistinct chatter)

01:02.729 --> 01:04.773
* *

01:26.294 --> 01:28.505
* *

01:43.019 --> 01:45.313
(clears throat)

01:51.486 --> 01:52.779
(clears throat)

02:10.213 --> 02:11.715
(camera clicks)

02:14.426 --> 02:16.678
(helicopter blades whirring)

02:21.975 --> 02:24.227
(phone ringing)

02:25.895 --> 02:27.856
Sojani, how's Turkey?

02:27.897 --> 02:29.190
Great coffee.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.818
And, I'm gonna be sending you
something shortly.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.738
It's about the guy
that killed Zachary Solomon.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.408
* *

02:52.797 --> 02:55.508
(coffee pouring)

02:55.550 --> 02:58.261
(cup clinking)

03:02.515 --> 03:05.435
She was just here.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.730
She came here to help me,
and the last thing

03:08.772 --> 03:10.065
-I ever did was lie to her.
-No.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.609
-I should have listened to you.
-Kat...

03:12.650 --> 03:14.569
Why couldn't I just
listen to...?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.945
We couldn't have known
he'd do something like this.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.281
We did know! He warned us.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.618
God, what was I thinking?

03:21.659 --> 03:24.079
You were thinking
about your father.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.289
KATHERINE:
My father.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.802
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.553
He's alive.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.555
I want to believe that, I do.

03:42.597 --> 03:47.227
But... but if he's not,
then Trish died for nothing,

03:47.268 --> 03:50.522
and all we're doing is
putting more people in danger.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.400
I have to know if he's alive.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.736
The only way to know for sure,

03:56.778 --> 04:00.448
is for us to find the capstone
and give Mal'akh what he wants.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.159
Not us.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.703
You.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.122
-I'm not leaving you.
-You have to do this alone,

04:07.163 --> 04:09.124
you have to do what he wants.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.584
Find the clues,
and hope that in the end,

04:11.626 --> 04:14.546
you're right, and this ancient
wisdom is just some myth.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.841
-Of course it is.
-You saw what was on that film.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.885
I don't know what I saw.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.804
A natural phenomenon,
a trick of editing...

04:22.846 --> 04:25.765
Dad would always cite
these historical anomalies:

04:25.807 --> 04:27.809
how did the ancient Egyptians

04:27.851 --> 04:30.770
move hundred-ton stones
and build pyramids?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.690
How did the pre-Columbian tribes
cut solid granite

04:33.732 --> 04:35.817
with more precision
than a modern laser?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.820
He thought that it could be
explained by some kind of power

04:38.862 --> 04:42.115
that we've forgotten.
What if he was right?

04:42.907 --> 04:48.538
What if that power reemerged in
the hands of someone truly evil?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.002
I'm not going to be there
to remind you,

04:54.044 --> 04:56.504
but if your mind isn't open,
you are limiting

04:56.546 --> 05:00.091
what you can perceive,
and understand.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.053
Like, answers from the universe?

05:04.262 --> 05:06.681
We need all the help we can get.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.561
Kat.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.984
You can't go back to the house.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.986
Sato probably has people
watching it.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.906
I'm counting on it.

05:32.123 --> 05:36.211
NUÑEZ:
So, this dude made them
kill themselves.

05:36.252 --> 05:40.423
-A whole flock of birds?
-No, that would be impossible.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.551
So, what then? Mass suicide?
I mean, can birds even do that?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.887
It's got to be some kind of
trick photography.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.599
If I can just find the edits...

05:51.476 --> 05:53.812
Does this mean anything to you?

05:55.647 --> 05:57.524
LANGDON:
Looks like a Triskelion.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.775
Why?

05:58.817 --> 06:02.070
Where he left Trish,
he drew that.

06:02.112 --> 06:06.408
It represents different things
to different cultures.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.078
Celtics, pagans, Freemasons.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.415
Most often it represents
a-a cycle:

06:13.456 --> 06:15.166
birth, death, rebirth.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.926
Uh-oh.
You got that look.

06:27.762 --> 06:31.224
Film companies use
shape sequences as edge code

06:31.266 --> 06:34.185
to indicate different things
like date or production number.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.605
Squares, triangles,
X's, crosses, but they didn't

06:37.647 --> 06:43.778
start using three-shape
sequences until the '80s.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.489
This circle shouldn't be here.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.533
Um...

06:49.659 --> 06:51.828
-(snaps fingers)
-That a scanner?

06:51.870 --> 06:55.081
NUÑEZ:
Okay, here we are.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.916
Boom, got that...

06:56.958 --> 07:00.837
LANGDON:
Microdots were used
as early as World War I

07:00.879 --> 07:03.256
in tiny notes
sent by carrier pigeon.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.967
They could hide information
in something

07:06.009 --> 07:08.636
as small as a punctuation mark.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.851
Huh.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.486
-There it is.
-What the...?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.738
LANGDON:
"An architect with 46,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.948
builds a bridge
of weightless bricks."

07:31.618 --> 07:33.411
It's a riddle.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.081
That's incredible.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.917
Sojani found a former guard
from Ag Gecidi prison,

07:38.958 --> 07:40.919
now runs a coffee shop
in Istanbul.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.005
-He gave her this.
-What am I looking at?

07:44.047 --> 07:47.008
SATO: Zachary Solomon,
three years ago at the prison.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.844
And this is one
of the only known photos

07:49.886 --> 07:52.305
of a prisoner who
went by the name of Samyaza.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.015
Look familiar?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.936
Intel points to him
as Zachary's likely killer.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.439
Which means, he left this...

08:01.481 --> 08:03.733
which should look familiar.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.196
And when you consider that,
this guy?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.908
Starts to look a lot like...

08:12.784 --> 08:15.245
-...this guy.
-No way.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.248
You think he came 5,000 miles
to finish off the family?

08:18.289 --> 08:21.751
Never underestimate
a man with a God complex.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.427
Hey, coast is clear out front.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.595
-You got it?
-I think so.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.806
"An architect with 46,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.809
"builds a bridge
of weightless bricks.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.687
"In Etam waits a stone
once hewn,

08:40.729 --> 08:42.897
"returned at last
to mother's womb.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.191
"Lastly,
heed the Starling's call,

08:45.233 --> 08:47.652
for all who seek
must also fall."

08:47.694 --> 08:50.155
Yeah, I'm more of a sudoku guy.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.866
I'm not sure if I know
what it means either.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.201
-The word "stone"
is pretty clear.
-Right.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.911
Wh-Where's Etam?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.664
It's interesting--
in the 9th century BC,

08:59.706 --> 09:01.458
it was a city located
in the Kingdom of Judah.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.754
In present day, I'd put it
somewhere south of Bethlehem?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.088
See, I was thinking
I'd come with you

09:07.130 --> 09:08.548
on this capstone mission,

09:08.590 --> 09:10.258
but Israel might
be a little far for me.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.968
Yeah, I appreciate the offer,

09:12.010 --> 09:14.471
but I think it's best
if I go it alone.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.890
Hold up.
You might need protection.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.810
And who's going to protect you?
And your wife?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.066
Zoe went to stay
at her cousin's, so...

09:30.111 --> 09:31.738
Oh.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.450
Um, I think I got to do this
on my own.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.826
Okay. All right,
hold on, hold on.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.578
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.213
Any sign of trouble,

09:48.254 --> 09:50.715
make sure you get to a phone
and you call me.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.218
-Thank you.
-Yeah?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.427
-Yeah.
-All right.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.346
Oh...

09:56.388 --> 09:58.640
Oh, all right.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.521
-Yeah.
-Come on. I'll let you
out the back.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.986
(clock ticking)

10:25.417 --> 10:27.669
* *

10:32.298 --> 10:35.552
YOUNG KATHERINE:
What do you mean
you don't know what it is?

10:35.593 --> 10:37.137
You know everything.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
Well, that's the problem

10:38.221 --> 10:39.889
when knowledge gets lost
to history.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.976
But people have theories
about henges, okay?

10:43.018 --> 10:46.604
Some people think that a henge
was an ancient burial site.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.815
Other people say
that ancient astronomers

10:48.857 --> 10:53.111
would use a henge as a sundial--
you know sundials?

10:53.153 --> 10:58.033
And they'd use it to worship
a solar deity, a sun god.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.952
I don't get why Zach and Mommy
didn't want to see this.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.330
Well, sweetie, not everyone's
as curious as you are.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.874
Always keep that.

11:05.915 --> 11:10.086
You make me curious;
you're my own little sundial.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.422
(sniffles)

11:12.464 --> 11:14.716
(exhales shakily)

11:17.927 --> 11:19.804
Where are you, Dad?

11:36.571 --> 11:40.200
-(ticking)
-(heart beating)

11:42.660 --> 11:44.162
(creaking)

11:46.498 --> 11:48.792
Hi, Katherine.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.294
I'm Inoue Sato.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.423
(letter opener drops)

11:55.465 --> 11:58.802
Can I have a few moments alone
in my father's house?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.720
Do you think
that's such a good idea,

12:00.762 --> 12:03.181
considering everything
that's happened?

12:04.099 --> 12:07.143
You and Robert
have been through a lot.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.021
I can't imagine what a shock
this has all been.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.775
Your father,
now your research assistant.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.238
-If there's anything I can do...
-I just want my dad back.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.156
-Me, too.
-Really?

12:20.198 --> 12:22.242
Because, as far as I can tell,
you've been spending

12:22.283 --> 12:23.618
all your time chasing us.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.286
I'm trying to protect you.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.874
(indistinct chatter)

12:39.843 --> 12:41.886
Roosevelt was once shot
in the chest

12:41.928 --> 12:44.264
right before giving a speech.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.099
Didn't faze him, though.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.602
And he went on to give
an iconic performance.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.689
They should have
tried poisonous gas.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.650
Something happen?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.903
Son, I've been locked up
in a CIA bed-and-breakfast

12:58.945 --> 13:00.280
for the last 48 hours.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.074
Seems they're after
the portal as well.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.703
Look, you called me here. Why?

13:06.745 --> 13:09.289
I decoded the Hebrew
from the Bible page.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.624
It led us to
Oaken Hill Cemetery.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.294
Guy showed up, tried to gas us;
I thought it might be one of

13:14.336 --> 13:15.879
your Leviathan friends.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.091
Well, there are members
within the group that, uh,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.261
will go to extremes
to protect the secret.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.681
How's Katherine?
Is she all right?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.851
Not really.
A woman she works with

13:29.893 --> 13:32.228
was killed last night,
body was left

13:32.270 --> 13:34.981
at the Adams Memorial
as a warning to us.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.025
I heard about that.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.152
I had no idea
there was a connection.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.821
A psychopath
is killing people to ensure

13:41.863 --> 13:43.490
that I keep going,
and your Leviathan friends

13:43.531 --> 13:46.951
are showing up in gas masks
trying to get me to stop.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.246
But I can't stop,
not if I want to get Peter back.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.668
How can I help?

13:54.709 --> 13:57.087
We found a film.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.674
There was a riddle hidden
in the edge code, a clue:

14:00.715 --> 14:03.760
"An architect with 46."

14:03.802 --> 14:06.346
The "S" of the six
written as a dollar sign.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.806
Forty-six...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.599
-That mean something to you?
-Well, if I were to guess,

14:09.641 --> 14:12.185
I'd say that was in reference
to the architect

14:12.227 --> 14:16.022
who designed the plans
for Washington, D.C.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.108
Pierre Charles L'Enfant.
Who was a Mason,

14:18.149 --> 14:21.152
so that part fits,
but, uh, why "46"?

14:21.194 --> 14:24.364
And-and, what does that
have to do with the capstone?

14:24.406 --> 14:27.283
Well, that's something
I can't tell you.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.952
Because you're afraid
of who might find out?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.913
Because it would be
better to show you.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.047
KATHERINE:
Figured you'd come here.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.924
I was banking on it, actually.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.343
Okay.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.804
I need something
only the CIA can provide.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.473
Are you familiar
with psychometry?

14:50.515 --> 14:54.227
Sometimes people can sense
things off of personal objects,

14:54.269 --> 14:56.604
feel things about the people
the objects belong to.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.273
Kind of a psychic surveillance.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.899
But some people
don't need objects.

14:59.941 --> 15:03.028
The CIA refers to them
as "remote viewers."

15:03.069 --> 15:04.404
Not exactly my department.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.781
But you know
about Project Stargate.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.492
I know it was terminated
in 1995.

15:09.534 --> 15:13.329
"Officially defunded"
was the technical designation.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.375
A side program still exists.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.087
If the remote viewing program

15:21.129 --> 15:23.840
were still active,
hypothetically,

15:23.882 --> 15:25.759
what's your interest?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.218
I want to talk
to the head viewer.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.804
I need him to find my father.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.141
I'll see what I can do.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.729
In the meantime, I received
some information today

15:37.771 --> 15:39.481
that you might be interested in.

15:40.565 --> 15:41.816
About my dad?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.860
About the man who
might have taken him.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.821
* *

15:52.410 --> 15:54.245
His real name is a mystery. Most
of the personnel records were

15:54.287 --> 15:55.830
burned up in the riot,
but at the prison,

15:55.872 --> 15:58.500
he was called Samyaza.

15:58.541 --> 16:03.088
-What kind of a name is that?
-Biblical. A fallen angel.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.590
By all accounts,
this guy embraced the role.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.718
Ran an extremely violent
drug gang at the prison,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.304
inspired slavish devotion.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.932
And those who wouldn't devote,
he'd break.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.851
I think Zachary
was one of those people.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.145
That makes sense.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.899
My brother was pretty
antiestablishment,

16:22.941 --> 16:25.193
so he wasn't about
to join some cult.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.448
Whatever his issues, I think,

16:30.490 --> 16:33.910
in his own way, Zachary was
trying to do the right thing.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.371
What does this have to do
with my dad?

16:38.039 --> 16:40.000
I think it might
be the same guy.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.918
-What?
-First your brother,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.087
then your father.
You could be next.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.172
-This is crazy.
-Did Zach ever

16:46.214 --> 16:48.299
mention anyone like this
at the prison?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.636
I just don't-- I don't know,
not that I can remember. He...

16:54.139 --> 16:56.433
He wrote me some letters.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.976
There might be something
in them.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.061
I haven't looked at them
in years.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.147
I'd like to take a look,
if that's okay.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.817
(phone vibrates)

17:05.859 --> 17:08.611
My contact at Project Stargate
came through.

17:08.653 --> 17:12.032
He found the man you asked for.
What now?

17:13.908 --> 17:15.493
Bring him to my lab.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.538
Then you can have the letters.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.501
(breathing deeply)

17:34.262 --> 17:37.015
(Bastin clears throat)

17:40.643 --> 17:42.687
It's urgent.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.983
Blood pressure's plunging,
respiration is weak.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.194
-I can stabilize him.
-No need.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.905
We'll continue as is.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.491
-He could die.
-He must

17:54.532 --> 17:56.034
go all the way
through the process

17:56.076 --> 17:59.120
if he's to serve
his ultimate purpose.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.586
BELLAMY: L'Enfant was on top
of the world; then, overnight:

18:06.628 --> 18:08.380
persona non grata.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.800
Some say he tried to
learn too much.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.386
(trills, beeps)

18:18.515 --> 18:21.476
All he left behind
were three watches,

18:21.518 --> 18:25.188
three compasses,
two books and a map.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.190
The last of
his earthly possessions.

18:27.232 --> 18:31.111
Value at the time: $46.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.032
Huh.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.701
Take the books.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.429
LANGDON:
3:40,

18:57.470 --> 18:58.596
2:30,

18:58.638 --> 19:00.306
5:45.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.809
Why did the riddle lead to this?

19:04.728 --> 19:06.604
Weird.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.898
The 38 latitude marker
is in blue ink,

19:08.940 --> 19:10.775
which would have been
extremely expensive

19:10.817 --> 19:12.360
in the early 19th century.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.363
Thirty-eight.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.741
Look at that first watch:
three and eight.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.242
This isn't right.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.286
If this watch had stopped
at 3:40,

19:21.327 --> 19:22.746
then the hour hand would be

19:22.787 --> 19:24.998
two-thirds of the way
between three and four,

19:25.040 --> 19:28.793
but both hands point precisely
at numbers-- same for these two.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.465
Three and eight: 38.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.427
Huh.

19:37.469 --> 19:40.013
Degrees. Minutes. Seconds.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.934
-These watches are coordinates.
-Coordinates for the capstone.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.937
-Could be.
-Wouldn't you need longitude?

19:47.979 --> 19:49.773
Yes.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.485
Okay, where are you?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.914
What does that look like to you?

20:05.955 --> 20:07.957
It's a Masonic square.

20:07.999 --> 20:11.461
The square represents morality.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.965
And the compass:

20:16.007 --> 20:18.176
boundaries.

20:18.218 --> 20:22.639
Which gives us
a very familiar symbol.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.725
BELLAMY:
"Ye who are engaged
in the pursuit of wisdom

20:25.767 --> 20:29.145
must also make use of
the square and compass."

20:29.187 --> 20:32.107
And the other.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.150
So...

20:34.192 --> 20:38.488
if 38 degrees,
26 minutes and 59 seconds

20:38.530 --> 20:41.825
gives us our latitude line,

20:41.866 --> 20:44.911
then the compasses

20:44.953 --> 20:48.707
point to our longitude.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.836
"X" marks the spot.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.715
-Aquia.
-It's a town in Stafford County.

20:58.383 --> 21:02.470
Wigginton, that's a quarry

21:02.512 --> 21:04.723
in Aquia
that L'Enfant purchased.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.685
-A quarry.
-In fact, half the buildings

21:08.727 --> 21:11.604
are made with sandstone
from that quarry.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.481
The Capitol Building,
the White House,

21:13.523 --> 21:15.358
the Washington Monument...

21:15.400 --> 21:19.154
"In Etam waits
a stone once hewn,

21:19.195 --> 21:22.157
returned at last
to mother's womb."

21:22.198 --> 21:26.077
The capstone is returned

21:26.119 --> 21:29.039
to the quarry it came from.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.707
SATO:
Katherine Solomon,

21:30.749 --> 21:32.584
meet Ario Fazeli.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.960
Thank you so much for coming.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.713
Ario started at the Agency
in Tehran,

21:36.755 --> 21:38.381
helping to remotely
track victims

21:38.423 --> 21:39.883
during the hostage crisis.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.052
-Now, he assists at...
-Fort Meade. I know who you are,

21:42.093 --> 21:43.136
Mr. Fazeli. It's a pleasure.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.721
Did you know he located

21:44.763 --> 21:46.056
the "Titanic"
on the ocean floor?

21:46.097 --> 21:49.017
They couldn't put it
in the movie, of course.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.394
National security or whatever.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.563
Well, I'm just very glad
you're here.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.607
Shall we get started?

22:00.528 --> 22:02.781
(birds chirping)

22:07.952 --> 22:09.954
* *

22:16.961 --> 22:18.546
(exhales)

22:21.257 --> 22:23.301
"An architect with 46,

22:23.343 --> 22:26.763
builds a bridge
of weightless bricks."

22:31.893 --> 22:36.439
"In Etam waits
a stone once hewn,

22:36.481 --> 22:39.442
"returned at last to mother's...

22:42.362 --> 22:44.364
...womb."

22:49.911 --> 22:51.955
(phone vibrating)

22:55.375 --> 22:58.461
Yeah, hello?
Lace, Lace, I'm here.

22:58.503 --> 23:01.631
You got something?
On the Janitor, right?

23:01.673 --> 23:04.718
Nicholas Bastin.
You got an address?

23:04.759 --> 23:07.971
Perry Street.
Yeah, up by LeDroit Park?

23:08.013 --> 23:09.472
Uh-huh.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.823
* *

23:47.552 --> 23:49.512
* *

24:00.231 --> 24:02.859
(knocking)

24:02.901 --> 24:06.404
Hello, ma'am,
my name is Alfonso Nuñez.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.157
Are you with the CIA?
'Cause I already talked to them.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.368
Never thought I'd hear those
words come out of my mouth.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.912
I'm not with them.
I'm looking for Nicholas Bastin.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.663
So are they.
They wouldn't tell me

24:15.705 --> 24:18.375
what they wanted with him,
though.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.293
Will you?

24:20.335 --> 24:22.045
(sighs)

24:22.087 --> 24:23.713
What is it?

24:25.256 --> 24:26.508
What happened?

24:26.549 --> 24:29.177
Your husband shot me,

24:29.219 --> 24:31.054
and I'd like to ask him why.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.015
But since I can't,
I'm here talking to you.

24:35.809 --> 24:38.144
He's not my husband anymore.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.981
Thank you.

24:49.072 --> 24:53.159
When's, um,
last time you saw him?

24:53.201 --> 24:55.495
I don't know,
six or seven months?

24:55.537 --> 24:59.749
If you don't mind me asking,
how long were you together?

24:59.791 --> 25:02.585
Six years,
before he got deployed.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.087
He was a medic.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.381
Wanted to come back
and become a surgeon,

25:06.423 --> 25:11.720
but when he got back,
things were different.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.726
I was there, too, uh...

25:19.352 --> 25:20.937
It's tough on a marriage.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.648
We tried to start a family.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.028
But it wasn't meant to be.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.990
Then he went back to
the Middle East to travel,

25:32.032 --> 25:33.283
to get away.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.993
Said he felt drawn to
that part of the world.

25:35.035 --> 25:39.914
And he met someone, some guru.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.375
Said he saved his life.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.794
Did this guru have a name?

25:44.836 --> 25:46.796
Nick never said it.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.923
Like it was sacred or something.

25:48.965 --> 25:55.055
You've seen him since--
did he seem "saved"?

25:57.807 --> 25:59.184
-Um, I-I've got to go.
-(phone chimes)

25:59.225 --> 26:01.561
I have work.

26:02.896 --> 26:05.190
Yeah, I got to go, too.

26:09.027 --> 26:11.196
I was, uh,
treated at Faiths United.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.449
-You a nurse or...
-Pharmacist.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.785
And I really got to go.

26:17.827 --> 26:20.080
Thanks again for your time.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.043
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

26:25.085 --> 26:26.711
A fundamental belief
of noetic science is that

26:26.753 --> 26:29.673
all information is connected
beyond space and time: hunches,

26:29.714 --> 26:32.550
intuition,
even knowing when someone

26:32.592 --> 26:33.968
is about to call
right before they do.

26:34.010 --> 26:37.347
I'm a scientist,
so I'm the first to admit

26:37.389 --> 26:39.307
that there is a wide margin
of error here.

26:39.349 --> 26:42.435
But I need to try.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.397
From what I know about
remote viewing,

26:45.438 --> 26:47.023
it's location-directed.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.859
He doesn't need coordinates?

26:49.901 --> 26:52.237
That's the traditional model.
In this model,

26:52.278 --> 26:54.906
Peter himself is the location,
and Ario is trying to see him,

26:54.948 --> 26:57.075
or see what he sees.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.077
It could come in flashes
of color,

26:59.119 --> 27:00.954
smells, tastes, visual images

27:00.995 --> 27:04.249
so fleeting, a less-trained mind
might miss them.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.296
I have pickleball at 6:00.

27:10.338 --> 27:13.717
Of course.
Whenever you're ready.

27:16.553 --> 27:18.513
(wind whistling)

27:18.555 --> 27:21.766
(panting softly)

27:21.808 --> 27:24.269
(quietly):
So stupid.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.730
(grunting)

27:33.820 --> 27:35.613
(exhaling sharply)

27:35.655 --> 27:38.324
Oh...

27:39.492 --> 27:41.870
(breathing heavily)

27:43.288 --> 27:44.873
(groans)

27:56.801 --> 27:59.012
* *

28:12.734 --> 28:14.986
(wind gusting)

28:19.032 --> 28:22.702
"Lastly,
heed the Starling's call,

28:22.744 --> 28:27.957
for all who seek
must also fall."

28:30.001 --> 28:32.921
Again, the name of the target
is Peter Solomon.

28:32.962 --> 28:36.174
Born in 1963,
alumnus of Harvard,

28:36.216 --> 28:38.718
secretary of the Smithsonian.

28:39.803 --> 28:42.055
My father.

28:44.057 --> 28:47.310
There's... a degree
of intensity.

28:47.352 --> 28:50.897
-Something biological.
-Human or animal?

28:52.524 --> 28:55.318
There's an upright point.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.863
A triangle, a rectangle.

28:58.905 --> 29:03.493
A... a metallic taste,
something permanent.

29:03.535 --> 29:09.207
Ah, something very white,
or that reflects light.

29:09.249 --> 29:12.919
Some element containing water.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.882
Cold, cold.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.052
I-It's cold.

29:21.094 --> 29:24.723
(gasping)
T-Tension.

29:24.764 --> 29:29.269
There's slowing, it's...

29:29.310 --> 29:31.271
darkening.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.774
-(gasps)
-(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:41.698 --> 29:44.784
(beeping slows)

29:59.716 --> 30:01.968
(monitor flatlines)

30:20.904 --> 30:22.947
I'm sorry, it's gone.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.657
What happened?
What did you see?

30:24.699 --> 30:26.951
Well...

30:28.328 --> 30:32.832
It's all here.
It's just that I, um...

30:32.874 --> 30:36.920
I sensed him, and then...

30:36.961 --> 30:39.339
I don't think
he's with us anymore.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.216
I'm so sorry.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.521
SATO:
There's a wide margin
of error, you said that.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.235
This doesn't mean anything.

31:00.276 --> 31:03.863
I'm sorry, I need some air.

31:06.574 --> 31:09.828
Did you really see him?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.996
I sensed him.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.669
(paper rustles)

31:17.711 --> 31:18.670
(wind whistling)

31:18.712 --> 31:20.005
(groans, inhales sharply)

31:20.046 --> 31:22.966
-(panting)
-(bird cawing)

31:24.175 --> 31:27.554
I got offered
a fellowship at Oxford.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.514
Well, congratulations,
that's great.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.725
Thank you.
I don't know what to do.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.476
It'd take me away from Katherine

31:33.518 --> 31:37.605
at the worst possible time,
as well as you, too.

31:37.647 --> 31:40.525
(sighs) I've analyzed it
from every angle,

31:40.567 --> 31:43.028
all the variables,
possible outcomes...

31:43.069 --> 31:45.321
Yeah. Yeah, well,
you can't solve this

31:45.363 --> 31:46.865
like one of your puzzles,
Robert.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.200
This is different, this is life.

31:49.242 --> 31:51.870
How do I decide then?

31:51.911 --> 31:54.122
Use your intuition.

31:54.164 --> 31:56.666
"To one of faith,
no explanation is needed.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.169
To one of no faith,
no explanation is possible."

31:59.210 --> 32:01.504
Thomas Aquinas.

32:01.546 --> 32:03.548
You know I don't believe
in a higher power.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.467
I mean,
have you never experienced

32:05.508 --> 32:08.553
something you couldn't explain?
Have you never considered,

32:08.595 --> 32:10.180
even for a moment,

32:10.221 --> 32:12.932
there might be something
larger at work?

32:20.273 --> 32:24.736
Uh, when I was eight years old,
I ran away from home.

32:24.778 --> 32:28.406
I just remember
wanting to get away, hide.

32:28.448 --> 32:33.119
And there was this, uh,
old well in the woods.

32:36.498 --> 32:40.085
I lowered myself
about halfway down,

32:40.126 --> 32:43.129
-and I lost my grip and fell.
-(echoes): Help!

32:44.130 --> 32:46.675
So what happened?

32:46.716 --> 32:51.054
I tried to get back up;
the walls were too wet.

32:51.096 --> 32:53.431
I was stuck, treading water.

32:53.473 --> 32:56.101
I yelled for help,
but no one came.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.104
(echoing):
Help! Someone!

32:59.145 --> 33:00.438
It seemed like hours.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.900
I was going to give up,
let myself drown.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.068
(gasping)

33:05.110 --> 33:06.861
And then I...

33:06.903 --> 33:10.949
I heard this voice,
like it was right there with me.

33:10.990 --> 33:15.161
-It told me to keep going.
-VOICE (whispers): Keep going.

33:15.203 --> 33:18.289
It said that they'd find me.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.626
And they found you.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.213
What did you think it was?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.175
Oh...

33:29.217 --> 33:31.386
I was exhausted, delirious.

33:31.428 --> 33:35.432
It was my mind playing tricks.

33:36.516 --> 33:40.603
Well, maybe it's time to
stop insisting that

33:40.645 --> 33:45.775
that voice wasn't real,
and try listening for it again.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.320
* *

34:05.545 --> 34:07.005
(yells)

34:07.047 --> 34:10.258
Whoa! Whoa!

34:10.300 --> 34:13.470
(laughs, pants)

34:13.511 --> 34:15.055
Oh...

34:22.103 --> 34:24.272
And then it had to be a cave.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.192
All right.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.277
(bird caws)

34:47.837 --> 34:50.090
* *

34:57.597 --> 34:59.557
(gasps softly)

35:06.189 --> 35:08.441
* *

35:29.879 --> 35:31.381
(clinks)

35:40.306 --> 35:42.809
(low rumbling)

35:45.311 --> 35:47.272
(scraping)

36:03.288 --> 36:05.623
* *

36:12.422 --> 36:14.591
* *

36:21.681 --> 36:25.310
"The secret hides
within The Order."

36:37.697 --> 36:39.908
(wind whistling)

36:39.949 --> 36:42.202
* *

36:54.297 --> 36:55.298
Oh!

36:55.340 --> 36:57.342
(grunts) Oh!

37:05.266 --> 37:07.352
-* *
-(gasping)

37:08.353 --> 37:10.563
NUÑEZ:
Take my hand!

37:13.775 --> 37:16.236
-Gotcha.
-(grunting)

37:16.277 --> 37:17.987
Come on.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.661
(both panting)

37:25.495 --> 37:28.456
Guess going solo
didn't exactly pan out.

37:28.498 --> 37:31.334
-How did you...?
-Put a tracker in your coat.

37:31.376 --> 37:34.504
Signal went dead
a little while ago.

37:34.546 --> 37:36.840
Had this feeling something bad
might've happened,

37:36.881 --> 37:39.467
so I followed it
and it led me here.

37:39.509 --> 37:42.470
-You put a tracker on me?
-Yeah.

37:48.518 --> 37:51.479
It was the hug, wasn't it?

37:51.521 --> 37:54.024
It was the hug.

38:00.530 --> 38:02.657
* *

38:26.890 --> 38:29.559
* *

38:41.696 --> 38:44.115
Project Stargate?

38:44.157 --> 38:46.785
I hear you pulled
some guy named Ario Fazeli

38:46.826 --> 38:48.870
out of the sub-program.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.997
Your job is
to find Robert Langdon,

38:51.039 --> 38:53.375
not hold a séance with his
girlfriend; so what's going on?

38:53.416 --> 38:56.503
I'm getting close to Katherine,
so that when Langdon surfaces,

38:56.544 --> 38:58.171
I'm right there waiting.

38:58.213 --> 39:01.925
Just like you want to be when
he finds your portal, right?

39:01.966 --> 39:07.514
You chose me because I always
get it done, so let me do it.

39:08.264 --> 39:10.892
Keep me apprised.

39:14.896 --> 39:16.106
(exhales)

39:22.779 --> 39:25.031
(crickets chirping)

39:32.288 --> 39:34.624
I don't know about this, man.

39:35.792 --> 39:38.586
She said she doesn't
want to see you.

39:38.628 --> 39:41.548
-She's afraid.
-Yeah, she should be.

39:41.589 --> 39:43.466
There she is.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.012
I just think she'd
really want to see this.

39:47.053 --> 39:49.639
NUÑEZ:
Yeah, I bet Mal'akh would, too.

39:49.681 --> 39:52.726
Look, all I'm saying is,
is after everything I done

39:52.767 --> 39:55.478
been through to save your ass,
I'm not gonna have you

39:55.520 --> 39:59.065
get carved up 'cause you can't
keep your puzzle in your pants.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.694
I'm just saying.

40:03.862 --> 40:06.656
When I was out there today,
it was almost like,

40:06.698 --> 40:09.951
for a moment, I don't know,

40:09.993 --> 40:12.787
Peter was right there with me.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.122
NUÑEZ:
That's why you want to see her.

40:14.164 --> 40:17.584
Tell her you believe
in stuff now.

40:19.836 --> 40:23.173
Maybe I just want her to know.

40:25.175 --> 40:28.094
(sighs)
Drive.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.891
-Yup.
-(engine starts)

40:39.105 --> 40:41.149
* *

41:03.088 --> 41:05.131
* *

41:15.934 --> 41:17.644
(exhales)

41:26.611 --> 41:28.905
* *

41:34.661 --> 41:36.621
(sniffles)

41:37.789 --> 41:40.125
I won't give up, Dad.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.928
* *

42:01.146 --> 42:03.940
(beeping)

42:13.908 --> 42:17.078
(shuddering, groaning)

42:24.002 --> 42:26.504
(panting)

42:26.546 --> 42:28.006
Katie...

42:28.048 --> 42:30.258
Shh.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.969
Save your strength.

42:33.011 --> 42:33.136
You're going to need it.
