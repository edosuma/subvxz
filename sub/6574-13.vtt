<i>How did it all go
so wrong so fast?</i>

00:19.800 --> 00:22.702
<i>I'd say I have no one
to blame but myself,</i>

00:22.742 --> 00:26.877
<i>except it's getting a little hard
to remember exactly who "myself" is.</i>

00:27.018 --> 00:31.563
<i>Thanks to this glamour charm,
the whole world thinks I'm Tigress,</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:36.826
<i>professional assassin and trusted member
of Black Manta's organization.</i>

00:36.957 --> 00:39.876
<i>But I'm one of the few people
the charm doesn't affect.</i>

00:39.918 --> 00:43.116
<i>And when I look in the mirror,
it's the only reminder I have left</i>

00:43.143 --> 00:46.569
<i>that I'm still Artemis.
What was I thinking?</i>

00:46.621 --> 00:49.410
<i>Wally and I really had
something special together.</i>

00:49.462 --> 00:53.599
<i>Leaving the whole hero thing behind
so we could just be... normal.</i>

00:53.691 --> 00:57.140
<i>But when Nightwing called,
I couldn't say "yes" fast enough.</i>

00:59.698 --> 01:03.412
<i>Tigress, report to
Kaldur'ahm's quarters at once.</i>

01:04.420 --> 01:07.636
- Yes, Boss?
- This is Psimon.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.978
He is here to psychically repair
the shattered mind of my son.

01:11.021 --> 01:14.082
- He can do that?
- Indeed, my dear.

01:14.108 --> 01:19.078
I'll dig right in and root about,
piecing his entire mental life together.

01:19.146 --> 01:23.983
By the time I'm done, I'll know
Kaldur'ahm better than he knows himself.

01:24.050 --> 01:27.119
Perfect.
<i>Yeah, perfect.</i>

01:27.187 --> 01:30.553
<i>If you don't mind Psimon
learning all Kaldur's secrets,</i>

01:30.588 --> 01:32.269
<i>including the one about
Aqualad and I</i>

01:32.270 --> 01:35.378
<i>being double agents for
the Team and the Justice League.</i>

01:50.121 --> 01:51.645
When can you begin?

01:51.680 --> 01:58.068
I need to focus, set my own mental
house in order before I enter his ruins.

01:58.282 --> 02:01.746
Stay with them
until the process is complete.

02:02.449 --> 02:05.071
My son never spoke
of his feelings,

02:05.089 --> 02:08.458
but his words could not hide how
much he cared for you, Tigress.

02:08.479 --> 02:12.682
I don't speak about my feelings either.
Not with words.

02:12.711 --> 02:15.630
Your actions define you.
I respect that.

02:15.656 --> 02:19.792
So you'll be glad to know I will take
action against the Martian witch

02:19.820 --> 02:22.599
that did this
to our beloved Kaldur'ahm.

02:23.765 --> 02:30.279
<i>Great. Now I have to rescue
Miss Martian, too. Long distance, no less.</i>

02:31.681 --> 02:34.012
I'm not
very comfortable with this.

02:34.033 --> 02:38.404
Delving into your mind,
it... it is an intrusion.

02:38.431 --> 02:40.233
You have my permission.

02:40.254 --> 02:43.199
We must be able to
trust each other.

02:46.037 --> 02:49.185
Does my smile displease?

02:49.205 --> 02:54.106
Is this not how humans convey
friendship and put each other at ease?

02:54.136 --> 02:56.472
There has to be another way.

02:56.492 --> 02:59.172
Look, I'm not sure what
the Martian etiquette is here,

02:59.190 --> 03:01.776
we need to trust each other,

03:01.815 --> 03:04.618
Which means we need to confirm
he is who he says he is.

03:04.654 --> 03:06.588
Miss M. is our only real option.

03:06.617 --> 03:10.787
Go for it, Angelfish. Reading this guy
will be a piece of crab cake.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.706
Please, proceed
with the mind link.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.423
<i>Link established.</i>

03:21.449 --> 03:25.020
<i>Ah... So you are a White Martian.</i>

03:25.061 --> 03:27.925
<i>You came to Earth
in order to pass as Green.</i>

03:27.979 --> 03:29.980
<i>That must have been
difficult.</i>

03:30.046 --> 03:32.146
<i>I'm supposed to be
reading you.</i>

03:32.189 --> 03:35.124
<i>But your reluctance
to probe deeply is clear.</i>

03:35.153 --> 03:38.375
<i>You hide the specifics, but I sense
you have recently had</i>

03:38.404 --> 03:41.903
<i>a most negative experience
during a hostile mind link.</i>

03:41.932 --> 03:45.228
<i>So allow me to volunteer
my thoughts.</i>

03:45.236 --> 03:50.341
<i>In this way, you can be sure
nothing so unfortunate will occur.</i>

03:59.142 --> 04:01.635
Green Beetle is
on our side.

04:04.701 --> 04:09.683
All right, I'm ready. Let's see
what the weather's like in there.

04:12.021 --> 04:16.103
Hmm. The Martian really did
a number on you, Kaldur.

04:16.128 --> 04:19.797
Believe me, I know how it feels.
But fear not.

04:19.857 --> 04:21.858
We'll have you up
and running in...

04:21.988 --> 04:23.457
No time.

04:23.766 --> 04:27.437
Something's... wrong.

04:27.504 --> 04:30.578
My mind... Clouding over.

04:30.599 --> 04:31.811
Ohh!

04:32.241 --> 04:34.143
- You!
- Ohh! Uhh!

04:39.182 --> 04:41.717
Uhh! Aah!

04:41.784 --> 04:43.963
<i>You've drugged me!
But why?</i>

04:43.979 --> 04:45.198
Uhh!

04:45.221 --> 04:47.922
<i>Psimon says:
reveal your secrets!</i>

04:47.946 --> 04:49.927
Uhh! Uhhh!

04:49.958 --> 04:53.527
<i>Artemis!
You're Artemis, and the drug...</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:57.446
<i>An invention of
your father, Sportsmaster.</i>

04:57.543 --> 05:02.113
<i>A single dose
simulates catatonia, for weeks.</i>

05:02.448 --> 05:05.883
<i>But you... heh...
miscalculated...</i>

05:07.167 --> 05:11.051
<i>How quickly
it takes effect...</i>

05:11.111 --> 05:12.712
Ohh...

05:13.776 --> 05:17.078
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

05:17.169 --> 05:19.739
He just went berserk.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.522
Is it possible
Miss Martian left

05:22.558 --> 05:26.528
some kind of telepathic virus
in Kaldur's mind?

05:26.790 --> 05:32.132
If she did, then any telepath we might
employ would only suffer the same fate.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.429
There's still one telepath
who can help us...

05:36.459 --> 05:38.326
Miss Martian herself.

05:38.512 --> 05:41.195
It's our only recourse.
Send me to the mainland.

05:41.217 --> 05:44.540
I'll bring back the Martian,
and we'll force her to cure Kaldur.

05:44.571 --> 05:48.559
Yes. Yes, of course.
But she is dangerous.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.335
Kaldur would never forgive me
if I sent you to face her alone.

05:51.371 --> 05:56.355
- I'll take a squad of troopers.
- No. You'll take Deathstroke.

05:57.009 --> 05:59.868
Perfect.

<i>From Lex Corp and The Reach.</i>

06:45.744 --> 06:49.515
This consumable contains
the Reach's additive,

06:49.564 --> 06:53.169
which combines microscopic
quantities of two chemicals.

06:53.201 --> 06:57.939
One is a dopamine polymerase,
the other an adrenaline inhibitor.

06:58.007 --> 07:04.112
Taken over generations, they will slowly
addict the entire population to Reach

07:04.141 --> 07:10.648
and make the people of Earth placid,
literally incapable of revolt.

07:10.687 --> 07:13.489
That matches up exactly
with Flash and Atom's analyses

07:13.510 --> 07:15.811
of the additive sample
acquired from Lex Corp.

07:15.871 --> 07:20.663
Ah, I see. Still I am...
Tested.

07:20.698 --> 07:23.936
- Look, we're sorry, but...
- No, it is wise.

07:23.967 --> 07:28.371
As they say on your world,
"all cards must be off the table".

07:28.438 --> 07:31.640
"On the table". Uh...
I mean... never mind. Ignore me.

07:31.708 --> 07:36.011
On the table. Yes.
That does make more sense.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.800
So here is my final card
on the table.

07:39.816 --> 07:45.133
My scarab informs me that the additive
also contains a mitochondrial marker

07:45.157 --> 07:48.794
which works as a meta-gene tracer,
allowing The Reach

07:48.818 --> 07:53.036
<i>to identify and isolate potential
superpowered individuals.</i>

07:53.052 --> 07:56.199
Making it easier to harvest
and weaponize the meta-gene!

07:56.266 --> 07:59.769
Our analysis didn't reveal that.
Thank you.

07:59.837 --> 08:03.329
- Can't we go public with this?
- I'll pass it on to Captain Atom,

08:03.360 --> 08:05.871
but the League's credibility
is at a record low right now.

08:05.887 --> 08:07.668
We'll probably
have to bide our time.

08:07.691 --> 08:10.580
Good work, everyone.
Meeting adjourned.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.949
Do you need a place
to stay on Earth?

08:13.017 --> 08:17.020
I will find a place near
Taos and attempt to blend in.

08:17.087 --> 08:22.591
So, Angelfish, could we go
somewhere private to talk?

08:27.510 --> 08:33.711
Um... Sure, La'gaan. We can talk at my
uncle J'onn's apartment in Chicago.

08:35.654 --> 08:39.457
- <i>Hermano</i>, the night is young.
- The night is over, <i>ese</i>.

08:39.489 --> 08:42.340
And all I want to do
is head home and catch some <i>Z</i> s.

08:42.376 --> 08:45.812
How about we meet up first thing
in the morning? You know, like, noonish?

08:45.837 --> 08:48.210
Sounds crash.
See you then.

08:52.353 --> 08:56.890
<i>Recognized: Miss Martian,
B-0-5.</i>

08:56.958 --> 09:00.527
<i>Lagoon Boy, B-1-8.</i>

09:04.772 --> 09:07.461
I can't wait any longer.
I have too many questions.

09:07.501 --> 09:10.762
Why have you been avoiding me?
Why haven't you returned my calls?

09:10.786 --> 09:12.876
What's going on
between you and Conner?

09:12.906 --> 09:15.388
Nothing. I mean,
not what you're thinking.

09:15.408 --> 09:17.563
Then what?
Angelfish, please.

09:17.594 --> 09:20.757
Well...
This is awkward.

09:20.994 --> 09:25.304
We hate to interrupt such
poignant interspecies romance,

09:25.382 --> 09:28.251
but we have pressing business
with the Martian.

09:35.995 --> 09:38.215
<i>Artemis?
That's you, right?</i>

09:38.262 --> 09:40.966
<i>It's me, M'gann,
and I'm here to kidnap you.</i>

09:41.001 --> 09:42.205
<i>What?!</i>

09:44.603 --> 09:46.364
<i>I need your help
to save Kaldur.</i>

09:46.395 --> 09:48.515
<i>But Deathstroke can't suspect
I'm on your side.</i>

09:48.530 --> 09:51.626
<i>Neither can La'gaan. I need you
to make this abduction good.</i>

09:59.551 --> 10:01.517
<i>Well, you don't have
to make it look that good.</i>

10:03.954 --> 10:08.253
Lagoon Boy to Team. We're under attack at
the Chicago Zeta tube. Requesting backup.

10:08.285 --> 10:11.759
<i>Acknowledged. We're 3 minutes from
the nearest tube, but we're on our way.</i>

10:14.398 --> 10:15.598
Uhh!

10:15.599 --> 10:19.469
See, calling for help like that
just pushes up the timetable.

10:19.537 --> 10:23.574
- Now I can't savor the battle.
- You want something to savor?!

10:35.856 --> 10:37.556
- Aah!
- La'gaan!

10:37.624 --> 10:40.511
Uhh!

10:43.931 --> 10:45.932
Now, that leg
doesn't look good.

10:45.999 --> 10:48.642
You know, I hate to see
any poor animal suffer.

10:48.669 --> 10:50.837
<i>You aren't on
the Light's hit list.</i>

10:50.904 --> 10:54.151
So how about a little anesthetic
for the pain?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.408
Aah!

11:05.084 --> 11:07.619
Aah!

11:17.495 --> 11:21.631
<i>Recognized: Superboy,
B-0-4.</i>

11:21.699 --> 11:24.701
<i>Nightwing, B-0-1.</i>

11:37.851 --> 11:43.072
So, my cards on the table...
Scarab's controllable now, more or less.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.269
And it seems to have
no interest in The Reach.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.739
But what if that changes?

11:46.773 --> 11:49.095
You fear it will take
full command,

11:49.126 --> 11:52.062
transforming you
into a weapon for The Reach.

11:52.098 --> 11:55.601
Got a prophecy hanging over my
head saying just that, and worse.

11:55.638 --> 12:01.142
I'd do anything, try anything,
to make sure it doesn't come true.

12:01.209 --> 12:03.914
I believe I may be
of assistance.

12:03.945 --> 12:08.069
Training and meditation can help you
control the scarab within.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.814
Is that how you did it?

12:09.849 --> 12:12.184
- In part.
- Well?

12:12.252 --> 12:15.588
I used my natural
shape-shifting abilities

12:15.632 --> 12:20.135
to reach inside my scarab and
ensure it could never take control.

12:20.172 --> 12:23.908
Ah. Too bad you can't
reach inside my scarab...

12:24.118 --> 12:27.367
Wait a minute. You can?
You can reach inside my scarab?

12:27.411 --> 12:30.084
Then you've got to do it, <i>ese</i>.
Please.

12:30.107 --> 12:32.491
I am sorry, but I must not.

12:32.506 --> 12:35.642
I would not have the same
control inside your bioform.

12:35.662 --> 12:38.931
The procedure would put
your life in grave danger.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.382
What part of "try anything"
did you not understand?

12:46.452 --> 12:49.153
Welcome aboard, Martian.

12:49.221 --> 12:52.551
Let me make your situation
perfectly clear.

12:52.613 --> 12:57.764
You are here to psychically repair the
damage you have done to my son's mind.

12:57.794 --> 13:01.129
This inhibitor collar negates
all your Martian abilities.

13:01.150 --> 13:05.442
In a moment, we will selectively
reinstate your telepathic power only.

13:05.470 --> 13:11.031
But before we do that, understand...
Deathstroke is watching you at all times

13:11.076 --> 13:14.145
<i>from beyond the range
of your psychic power.</i>

13:14.212 --> 13:18.182
<i>If he perceives even a hint of
trouble, he will press a button,</i>

13:18.202 --> 13:22.305
which will activate a substantial
explosive charge in your collar.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.110
So don't lose your head.

13:24.162 --> 13:25.529
Uhh!

13:25.597 --> 13:28.593
Deathstroke,
activate her telepathy.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.935
Now, save my son...

13:36.113 --> 13:37.757
Or die.

13:39.905 --> 13:41.940
You heard the man.
Get to it!

13:42.008 --> 13:45.511
<i>Artemis,
what... what should I do?</i>

13:45.552 --> 13:49.165
<i>Fix Kaldur. The three of us
will figure out the rest later.</i>

13:49.215 --> 13:51.216
<i>I'm not worried
about "the rest".</i>

13:51.243 --> 13:55.267
<i>But honestly, I don't know
if I can fix Kaldur.</i>

13:55.299 --> 14:01.160
<i>Breaking a mind is easy.
Restoring one may not even be possible.</i>

14:01.228 --> 14:03.362
<i>And what if
I make things worse?</i>

14:03.430 --> 14:08.201
<i>My mere presence in his mind
could be perceived as another attack.</i>

14:10.772 --> 14:12.440
<i>Then take me with you.</i>

14:12.474 --> 14:15.376
<i>He won't perceive me
as a threat. I can help.</i>

14:15.444 --> 14:20.748
<i>- Maybe. Or maybe I lose you, too.
- M'gann, we don't have any choice.</i>

14:20.784 --> 14:24.020
<i>No, I suppose we don't.</i>

14:30.893 --> 14:34.863
Artemis. Artemis!
You're not underwater. This isn't real.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.155
But if you allow the illusions
to hurt you here,

14:37.178 --> 14:40.858
your mind could suffer
real damage. Permanent damage.

14:42.571 --> 14:45.506
Right. Right.
It's all in my head.

14:45.574 --> 14:48.042
Well, Kaldur's head.

14:48.110 --> 14:52.809
<i>Kaldur's very messed up head.</i>

14:52.848 --> 14:58.218
This is how he perceives his psyche...
Atlantis in ruins.

14:58.286 --> 15:00.086
I don't even know
where to start.

15:05.843 --> 15:08.566
Tula!

15:09.363 --> 15:12.032
Neptune's beard!
Let go of me!

15:13.065 --> 15:15.469
I've got to save M'gann!

15:15.489 --> 15:17.257
La'gaan, calm down.

15:17.285 --> 15:19.486
There's nothing you can do
for her in your condition.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.665
Then what about him?
Why isn't he rescuing her?

15:22.689 --> 15:26.197
I know you dumped her, but
do you really hate her that much?

15:26.209 --> 15:28.457
You have no idea
what I feel for her!

15:28.484 --> 15:32.621
You're right, because I would never
abandon her to Kaldur and his flunkies,

15:32.689 --> 15:34.056
because that's
who took her...

15:34.123 --> 15:37.011
Aqua-traitor's personal
ninja pal, Tigress!

15:37.035 --> 15:41.263
Enough! I'm not supposed
to tell you... To tell anyone...

15:41.283 --> 15:44.586
But Aqualad is not
a traitor.

15:44.616 --> 15:47.451
What are you talking about?
He killed Artemis!

15:47.495 --> 15:49.129
No, he didn't.

15:49.158 --> 15:52.194
Aqualad has been on
a deep cover mission for months,

15:52.231 --> 15:55.822
infiltrating Black Manta's troops,
the Light, and The Reach.

15:55.848 --> 15:58.674
We faked Artemis' death.
She's alive.

15:58.681 --> 16:00.953
In fact,
Artemis is Tigress.

16:01.020 --> 16:04.191
If she kidnapped Miss Martian,
there has to be a good reason.

16:04.243 --> 16:08.246
Why am I only hearing this now?
I mourned Artemis.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.251
Neptune's beard, I tried
to tear Kaldur limb from limb.

16:11.284 --> 16:14.787
- You should have told me!
- No. Nightwing's our leader.

16:14.824 --> 16:18.090
We put our trust in him.
I'm sure he didn't keep this from us...

16:18.122 --> 16:21.296
From all of us...
without having his reasons.

16:21.332 --> 16:24.267
Look, we will figure this out.
Together.

16:24.303 --> 16:27.405
In the meantime,
get some rest.

16:27.747 --> 16:32.050
- Thanks for backing me up in there.
- You don't leave a guy a lot of options.

16:32.118 --> 16:34.667
You have no idea what your
secrets have done to us.

16:34.688 --> 16:37.983
- What does that... - M'gann
believed Kaldur had killed Artemis.

16:38.005 --> 16:42.489
So when she found him
on the Reach ship, she fried his brain.

16:42.529 --> 16:44.597
That's got to be
why Artemis grabbed her...

16:44.665 --> 16:46.566
To try and save
Kaldur's broken mind.

16:46.634 --> 16:49.035
But M'gann doesn't know
how to do that.

16:49.103 --> 16:50.719
So Manta may just kill her

16:50.759 --> 16:54.141
and kill Tigress if she blows
her cover trying to save her.

16:54.209 --> 16:59.065
And we'll have lost all 3 of them because
you thought it was a bad idea to share.

17:02.485 --> 17:05.454
Not real.
Not real. Not real.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.928
Aah!

17:24.574 --> 17:28.280
M'gann, snap out of it! You
know none of this is real.

17:28.317 --> 17:30.669
All my fault.
All my fault...

17:36.753 --> 17:38.084
Tula, stop!

17:38.115 --> 17:40.891
We're here, both of us,
to help Kaldur.

17:43.636 --> 17:45.804
Aah!

17:45.879 --> 17:49.118
Ugh. What am I doing?
You're not real, either.

18:01.744 --> 18:03.294
Kaldur!

18:04.555 --> 18:06.623
[speaking in Atlantian]

18:06.830 --> 18:09.032
What is left
of Kaldur'ahm?

18:09.068 --> 18:12.137
[speaking in Atlantian]

18:12.174 --> 18:15.248
I knew I should have paid more attention
in my freshman Atlantian class.

18:15.290 --> 18:17.425
Kaldur, listen.
It's Artemis.

18:17.492 --> 18:19.827
M'gann and I are here
to make you better.

18:19.855 --> 18:22.957
[speaking in Atlantian]
Artemis.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.601
[speaking in Atlantian]
I am alone.

18:26.669 --> 18:30.394
There is no one here.

18:31.664 --> 18:33.953
Nothing... Ruins.

18:34.144 --> 18:39.662
No! No. You're not alone! We're here!
We care about you and want to help!

18:39.690 --> 18:43.323
And we can do it!
What is the word?

18:43.354 --> 18:45.722
"Symbiosi".
Together.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.319
<i>Help us save you.
Symbiosi!</i>

18:58.340 --> 19:01.309
Do it. Finish it.
That's what I deserve.

19:01.352 --> 19:02.786
<i>No!</i>

19:07.394 --> 19:09.133
You want to blame yourself?
Fine,

19:09.141 --> 19:11.976
But only if you're willing
to do something about it.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.284
Kaldur, I am sorry.

19:16.299 --> 19:19.434
Please, let me help you.

19:19.588 --> 19:21.522
Help? No...

19:21.591 --> 19:24.620
Ruins...
All ruins.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.533
But it doesn't have
to be ruins.

19:27.553 --> 19:29.082
We can fix things.

19:29.097 --> 19:31.399
Symbiosi. Together.

19:44.688 --> 19:49.654
- Tigress. What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. I was...

19:49.722 --> 19:51.356
Lost in thought.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.819
It feels like I've been
standing here for hours.

19:53.835 --> 19:58.845
You... have. Six hours.
I came to check on your progress.

19:58.879 --> 20:04.284
We've only just begun. This...
Will take days. Maybe weeks.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.918
You better not be stalling,
Martian.

20:06.946 --> 20:10.282
Father. Father...

20:10.387 --> 20:17.072
- My son. I'm here. Kaldur'ahm.
- He's not back yet, not really.

20:17.127 --> 20:22.137
No, but I see you are making progress.
Keep it up, and you'll live.

20:22.173 --> 20:24.675
Tigress, a word.

20:28.210 --> 20:31.012
The witch is being more
cooperative than I imagined.

20:31.034 --> 20:33.738
Meaning you're having second
thoughts about killing her?

20:33.780 --> 20:37.182
She's safe, until she finishes
repairing my son.

20:37.258 --> 20:38.992
Then, she dies.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.799
Perfect.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.823
<i>Perfect...</i>

20:45.346 --> 20:48.368
Dude, I stopped by your house.
Your mom said you never went...

20:48.977 --> 20:51.982
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Greenie. You're
totally up in my buddy blue's grill.

20:52.028 --> 20:53.939
- Now, back off, or...
- Or nothing.

20:53.954 --> 20:58.855
- He did it! He fixed me!
- Great! Wh... what does that mean?

20:58.876 --> 21:04.608
The scarab, it's... Silent.
I'm in control now, 100%.

21:04.639 --> 21:07.398
Don't you get it, <i>ese?</i>
The Reach can't touch me.

21:07.441 --> 21:11.845
- I'm free! Permanently free!
- Crash.
