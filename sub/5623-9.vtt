14:35.440 --> 14:37.317
Love you too, Grandma.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.592
Your security system's a disgrace.
You should really get that looked at.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.279
Oh, and that little prick wasn't me.
I'm guessing you just met Jamie.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.278
SUTTON: Who the hell is... Oh!

14:52.840 --> 14:55.513
So Jamie is your twin.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.154
No flies on you, are there?

14:58.280 --> 15:01.750
Yet, funny, isn't it,
how long ago all of that feels?

15:01.880 --> 15:04.440
You needing blood,
me needing the bunker.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.155
Still... Now that none of us
are going to die...

15:08.280 --> 15:12.353
- You've a nerve coming here.
- Haven't I?

15:12.480 --> 15:16.792
See, now that there's a future,
I've been thinking what it holds for me.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.832
What kind of man will I be?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.872
And the answer I've come up with is...

15:24.760 --> 15:26.876
Rich.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.592
And that's where you come in.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.150
I'd like my inheritance now, please.

15:34.640 --> 15:38.349
This amount, first day of every month,
into this account.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.356
After all, it'd be a terrible shame

15:42.480 --> 15:45.472
if the world was to find out
you're actually alive.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.909
Now that there is a future,
you really wanna spend it behind bars?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.351
You're blackmailing me.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.830
Oh, how adorably old-fashioned!

15:56.960 --> 15:58.837
- Molby, take care of him.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.430
You really think I'd come
without an insurance policy?

16:04.520 --> 16:08.069
I'm sure you'll be keen to avoid
my little website going live.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.754
It's just a bunch of photos,
videos, maps.

16:12.880 --> 16:16.077
You know,
stuff lawyers might call evidence.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.716
It automatically goes live
unless I enter a code every 12 hours

16:20.840 --> 16:23.400
so by all means kill me.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.909
Seal your fate. Your choice.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.515
(LAUGHS) You know...

16:29.640 --> 16:32.552
In another life,
I would have rather liked you.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.318
You'll get your money.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.079
But if I ever see your face again,

16:38.200 --> 16:41.397
I <i>will</i> have you killed.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.671
I was just thinking...

17:48.880 --> 17:51.917
how lucky I am to have had you
in my life.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.477
We just shot the President. Shouldn't
you be having a nervous breakdown?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.556

18:04.160 --> 18:06.435
Yeah. (LAUGHS) Yeah.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.191
Alright, let's do it.

the shit hits the fan.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.789

you can spare me a minute or two?

so can you please...

22:31.960 --> 22:35.111
I... can save their lives.

That's really sweet of you
but you can't save them.

to come and live in a hole?

Oh my God, how can you even be hungry?

25:59.320 --> 26:03.029
I ain't hungry. You're looking
at pure willpower right here.

- You wish.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.354
I don't even understand why you're here.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.711
I mean, I know you escaped
and everything but...

26:31.840 --> 26:33.910
Hardly seems worth the death penalty.

26:34.040 --> 26:38.158
I guess they must have gotten me
on aiding and abetting a terrorist, huh?

26:40.680 --> 26:42.955
Oh God, you're here cos of me?

26:43.800 --> 26:46.917
- Leanne, I'm so sorry.
- Come on, it ain't your fault.

26:47.040 --> 26:52.068
It's my... back-stabbing,
bitch-ass husband put me in here.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.714
What happened?

26:56.120 --> 27:00.238
Well... I guess you could say
things kinda went downhill

27:00.360 --> 27:02.396
after I helped you escape.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.710
Todd Senior was pissed at me. Oh!

27:08.640 --> 27:10.915
We was fighting all the time.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.678
Sex went downhill...

27:14.920 --> 27:18.993
We was barely doing it two, three times
a night there towards the end.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.276
Worst part about it was...

27:23.840 --> 27:26.308
he turned my kids against me.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.559
Poisoned their minds against me somehow.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.352
Then the sheriff came to the door

27:31.480 --> 27:35.678
and I found out
there'd been a reward out on me.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.352
$10,000.

27:41.120 --> 27:45.830
20 years of marriage
sold out for the price of a boob job.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.196
I don't know what to say.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.632
Rhonda, listen to me.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.593
I know you're scared
and I know you feel like

28:00.720 --> 28:05.635
you ain't never gonna see your husband
and your son again but that ain't true.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.832
You <i>are</i> gonna see them again, in heaven.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.951
You ain't gonna be alone like me.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.629
- You're not gonna be alone.
- Of course I am.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.716
I ain't got nobody.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.874
I always used to think white was right.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.355
But it's white that betrayed me.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.999
Hmm.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.237
I guess the joke's on me, ain't it?

28:33.360 --> 28:35.271
(LAUGHS)

28:37.440 --> 28:40.910
You know, it don't feel too good
to realize that

28:41.040 --> 28:46.512
you been wrong...
about every single thing.

28:49.600 --> 28:53.354
Maybe it weren't the blacks
and the queers and the Jews

28:53.480 --> 28:55.948
I shoulda had a problem with.

OK, General,
hang up those guns and lock the door.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.239
My private is standing to attention
and awaiting your...

29:15.360 --> 29:17.828
- (SPIKE CLEARS THROAT)
...order.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.110
Hi, Uncle Scotty.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.477
Hello, Scotty, my name is Larsson
and I work for your mother.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.352
(LAUGHS)

29:27.480 --> 29:30.278
OK. Um...

29:31.200 --> 29:36.320
My mother's dead. So whoever you are,
could you please just...

29:39.600 --> 29:41.192
Kenneth?

29:44.360 --> 29:46.032
That's my Kenneth!

29:52.120 --> 29:55.157
- How did you get this?
- Like I said, I work for your mother.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.396
I don't have time to explain now
but she is alive

29:57.520 --> 29:58.919
and she wants to save your life.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.600
No, that's... that's impossible.
My mother is dead!

30:01.720 --> 30:04.188
My sister and I...

30:04.320 --> 30:07.551
We... We were orphans at five years old.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.477
You know what? Boo-fucking-hoo.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.034
Hey! You don't talk to him like that.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.833
I'll level with you.
I'm not here for my people skills.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.871
I'm sure you've stuff
to work out with your mother

30:17.000 --> 30:18.592
but for now let's stick to the facts.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.154
Armageddon is tomorrow.
Your mother has a bunker.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.157
She wants to save your life
so let's go.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.838
Well, actually, no,

30:24.960 --> 30:27.076
I'm sorry to disappoint you
but I don't wanna live.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.273
- But your nephew does.
- Hey, that's great. That is great.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.039
So you go have fun
but you can count me out of it.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.229
And what about Mom?

30:35.360 --> 30:39.672
She's in jail cos you uh...
put her there.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.554
Don't you think you owe her?
Don't you think you owe me?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.352
Man,
what do you want me to do about it?

30:45.480 --> 30:48.950
She's being held on a military base,
which is where you come in.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.752

30:50.880 --> 30:52.711

Fine. Fine. We'll help you get Rhonda
and we'll help you survive.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.231
We're not saving ourselves.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.113
Right?

31:23.560 --> 31:24.549
Right.

31:24.680 --> 31:28.036
I appreciate this
but I really don't need to be babysat.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.515
Yeah, well, better safe than sorry.

31:32.240 --> 31:36.233
MOLBY: It's chaos, Jamie. You wanna get
your family to the bunker, don't you?

31:36.360 --> 31:39.318
And it'll be safe in the bunker, right?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.635
Be a hell of a lot safer
than not being in there.

31:41.760 --> 31:42.988

32:40.240 --> 32:43.118
Ending Doofus, doofus.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.829
I could have just shot you in the car
but it didn't feel right.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.432
Whereas this...

32:51.200 --> 32:54.317
Entombed in your own bank vault.

32:54.440 --> 32:59.673
Atedious suburban end
to a tedious suburban life.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.153
What have I ever done to you?

33:01.280 --> 33:06.832
You know what it was like to grow up
being told how much better you were?

33:07.880 --> 33:10.917
Mum used to call you her "special boy."

33:11.920 --> 33:15.913
Said she gave you up
cos you deserved better.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.754
So I cyber-stalked you

33:19.880 --> 33:23.429
to find out what all the fuss was about.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.360
Only you weren't special.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.949
You were average.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.516
And I kept you that way.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.913
You know, the only thing sadder
than being a bank manager in Slough

33:43.040 --> 33:46.112
is playing a game

33:46.240 --> 33:49.630
where your avatar
is a Slough bank manager.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.035
And then having to watch

33:52.160 --> 33:54.993
as your wife falls in love with him.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.034
Don't!

34:04.440 --> 34:06.510
So you met Grandma, then?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.670
She's a dear, isn't she?

34:10.679 --> 34:15.356
Sadly, I burnt my bridges there
but luckily you didn't.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.871
So all I need do to survive
is pretend to be you.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.598
I've realized...

34:26.719 --> 34:30.156
Doofus wasn't a game.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.031
It was a rehearsal.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.033
I've watched you for so long.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.156
I know how you talk.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.431
How you move.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.550
I know how you think.

34:53.239 --> 34:57.756
So I'm gonna go now, find Frankie,

34:57.880 --> 35:02.749

in the honeymoon suite.

I can and cannot go, son.

you really want? To be my Pompeii?
