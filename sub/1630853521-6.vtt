00:02.306 --> 00:03.525
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise...

00:03.568 --> 00:05.092
I got a call
that I lost my new apartment.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.094
If you still
need a place to crash,

00:07.137 --> 00:08.312
the offer is still open.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.053
It's not every day you go up

00:10.097 --> 00:11.402
against your buddy
in a murder trial.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.838
Let's make a pact.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.884
We keep up
our weekly jogs as usual.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.190
You saw Rachel?

00:16.233 --> 00:19.280
Amy met her hotshot
D.C. attorney boyfriend.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.108
We were a thing,
like, a million years ago.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.979
You two
were more than a thing.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.155
Lo, do you still
have feelings for Andre?

00:30.943 --> 00:33.381

01:08.242 --> 01:10.548
Let you play a little bit.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.289
Good morning.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.204
What happened to you?

01:14.248 --> 01:16.206
Our daughter
thinks she's Basquiat.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.121
Nice.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.167
Daddy was your canvas, huh?

01:20.210 --> 01:21.777
How'’s the kitchen look?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.475
Uh, baby girl has an arm on her

01:24.519 --> 01:27.174
and you should probably
get breakfast out this morning.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.524
You excited
about your big day?

01:30.307 --> 01:32.744
Ehh. Just a little
bit of computer work.

01:33.745 --> 01:37.184
Robin Taylor. Come on.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.360
I know how much
you've been missing your job

01:39.403 --> 01:42.232
and a possible
interstate conspiracy case.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.321
It sounds exciting.

01:44.365 --> 01:47.150
Yeah. I do love spending
time with our little lady,

01:47.194 --> 01:49.152
but Lord, help me,
if I have to read

01:49.196 --> 01:51.676
<i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>
one more time...

01:53.374 --> 01:56.246
Maybe we should
think about getting a nanny.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.988
Uh. Lo, it'’s only
a few hours a week.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.295
I think the babysitter
can handle that.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.209
Okay.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.212
I'm gonna get in the shower.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.259
Did you have a bad dream?

02:10.042 --> 02:11.218
What makes you ask that?

02:12.001 --> 02:13.481
Mm, you're sweating.

02:21.663 --> 02:25.493
This writ of habeas corpus
is based on an affidavit

02:25.536 --> 02:29.192
from Damien Owens in which
he states he is responsible

02:29.236 --> 02:31.412
for a murder
that took place 20 years ago,

02:31.455 --> 02:34.284
a murder for which my client,
Randall Mack,

02:35.285 --> 02:36.939
was wrongfully convicted.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.203
At trial, Mr. Owens
claimed he was an eyewitness

02:40.247 --> 02:42.379
and testified
that he saw my client

02:42.423 --> 02:44.468
kill the decedent
in a bar fight.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.428
My client was found
guilty of first degree murder

02:47.471 --> 02:49.560
and has spent
the last 20 years in prison

02:49.604 --> 02:51.562
for a crime he did not commit.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.218
I ask that the writ be granted
and my client released.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.872
Ms. Lopez, wasn't your client

02:56.915 --> 02:58.265
convicted by a jury who found

02:58.308 --> 03:01.224
that the prosecution
had proven their case

03:01.268 --> 03:02.704
beyond a reasonable doubt?

03:02.747 --> 03:04.662
Yes, Your Honor, but Mr. Owens

03:04.706 --> 03:07.491
was the only
eyewitness to the actual crime.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
The other witnesses
were only able to testify

03:09.537 --> 03:11.756
to an earlier
disagreement that my client

03:11.800 --> 03:13.149
had with the decedent.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.237
Shouldn'’t the people be given

03:14.281 --> 03:16.239
the opportunity
to cross-examine?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.285
The affidavit is more
than legally sufficient

03:18.328 --> 03:20.200
for this court
to grant our request.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.289
Is the matter submitted?
Yes, Your Honor.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.465
I ask that the Court
expedite its ruling.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.684
Mr. Owens is ill,
and the doctors can't say

03:26.728 --> 03:28.251
how long he has left.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.254
We will take
that under advisement.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.822
Good day, Ms. Lopez.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.435
We should hear back

03:38.479 --> 03:40.176
from the Court
of Appeal in a few days.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.004
Then I will ask
the judge who gets assigned

03:42.047 --> 03:43.353
the hearing to expedite it.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.573
And I was
assured that Damien Owens

03:45.616 --> 03:47.009
is standing by to testify.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.273
I appreciate everything
you're doing, Ms. Lopez.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.232
Well, gratitude goes to Talisha,

03:52.275 --> 03:53.798
her letter
is the reason I'm here.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.453
Well, T'’s my biggest advocate.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.282
I'm just glad somebody
finally read my letter.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.371
I've been hounding
the Free Counsel Initiative

04:01.415 --> 04:04.461
for years for them
to take my dad's case.

04:04.505 --> 04:07.595
This was clearly
a miscarriage of justice.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.684
All of the other
evidence the prosecution

04:09.727 --> 04:12.513
presented was circumstantial
and inconclusive.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.863
And even Joe Loffton,
who was an accessory

04:14.906 --> 04:16.908
after the fact, he never
said that you were the killer.

04:16.952 --> 04:20.825
Never. This came down
to Damien Owens' testimony.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.523
And you--

04:22.566 --> 04:24.307
And you not having an alibi.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.158
Lola?

04:50.942 --> 04:53.554
Dre. I thought--

04:54.119 --> 04:57.427
What? I thought you went
back to D.C. with Rachel.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.647
I had some business
and a deal to close.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.910
Hey, perhaps
we can grab some dinner

05:01.953 --> 05:03.520
while I'm in town,
catch up.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.088
Catch up?

05:07.437 --> 05:08.960
I feel there were things
left unsaid between us.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.442
You know, I'’m here
on business for another week.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.923
I can call you.
You still have the same number?

05:18.492 --> 05:20.145
Or maybe you can call me.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.378
Um. Damn.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.468
So that is
Mr. Mighty Andre Armstrong,

05:38.512 --> 05:40.644
Esquire extraordinaire.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.385
How did you know?

05:42.429 --> 05:45.214
You're sweating, Lo.
You okay?

05:45.257 --> 05:48.391
I don't know.
I-- don't know.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.654
Why am
I letting this man get to me?

05:50.698 --> 05:53.701
You didn't get closure.
You need closure.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.225
Look at you.
Soundin'’ like Dr. Phil.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.576
Mm, I'’m serious.
Look, Mark, it's fine.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.013
Andre is only here for a week,
and then he's gone.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.406
And that'll be that.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.583
What?

06:06.627 --> 06:09.586
I thought you knew
that he might be merging

06:09.630 --> 06:11.588
with Audubon and Quinn.
And if he does,

06:12.154 --> 06:13.808
he's going to be out here a lot.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.463
- Doesn't mean I have to see him.
- He's dating Rachel.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.247
I don'’t know about that.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.075
Did you tell her to back off?

06:20.118 --> 06:22.382
No. Maybe.
Marky-Mark.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.559
Listen, I appreciate your
concern but I will be fine--

06:25.602 --> 06:27.212
Sure--
I have a great life--

06:27.256 --> 06:29.432
- A beautiful baby girl--
- Yeah-- Definitely--

06:29.476 --> 06:32.217
A husband who
is supportive and loving,

06:32.261 --> 06:34.437
handsome and sexy.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.265
You tryin'’
to convince me or you?

06:36.787 --> 06:38.398
What you got goin'’ on?

06:38.441 --> 06:39.573
Ah, so now
we're changing subjects?

06:39.616 --> 06:41.575
- Yup, keep up.
- Okay. All right.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.968
Uh, LAPD task
force is heating up.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.449
- The smash and grab thing?
- I just talked to the detective.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
They made more
arrests last night.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.452
More kids?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.236
What the hell is goin'’ on?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.542
I intend to find out.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.459
I think
I found the perfect apartment!

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
- Yes?
- Yes! It's in Santa Monica,

06:58.505 --> 06:59.941
it'’s a few blocks
from the beach.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.203
And the best part?

07:01.246 --> 07:02.944
No screaming nephews.

07:04.598 --> 07:05.729
Congratulations.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.427
Thank you.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.256
Thanks.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.302
Something'’s on your mind.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.609
Ohhh, no. Come on. Spill it.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.786
I'm worried
that going up against Mark

07:18.829 --> 07:20.570
has affected our friendship.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.529
Mm. Have you talked
to Mark since the trial?

07:23.747 --> 07:27.882
We made a pact; no matter
what, we jog every week.

07:27.925 --> 07:31.102
I'm sure he'll call.
Don'’t worry about it.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.457
- Ladies.
- Good morning.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.676
Amy, I've a huge favor to ask.
I've a client

07:39.720 --> 07:41.809
that needs help with a will.
Now, I'’d normally do it myself,

07:41.852 --> 07:44.333
but it needs
someone based here in L.A.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.769
Of course, I'd be happy to help.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.815
Great. Pick it up.

07:48.598 --> 07:52.036
Ada Bankok, meet
Amy Quinn and Vanessa Johnson.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.169
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.562
Ada'’s grandmother used to be

07:55.605 --> 07:58.173
one of my biggest clients,
and a dear friend.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.870
It was hard leaving grandmother.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.612
But I went back
every year for her birthday.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
This last one, uh...

08:07.487 --> 08:09.227
She seemed so good.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.665
I'm so sorry for your loss.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.711
I'll walk you out.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.453
This is no contest so
there shouldn't be any issues.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.281
You got it.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.544
Thank you.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.720
Seriously? We're slammed,

08:23.764 --> 08:25.374
and you're going
to take a will reading?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.550
No, you are.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.161
You said
you wanted more responsibility.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.772
Well, here's your chance.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.992
One chance is all I need.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.559
Okay.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.735
Lisa has the new job.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.215
Oh...

08:40.694 --> 08:42.565
- No.
- No, no, no.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.393
It's fine. It's fine.
It's just that--

08:44.828 --> 08:46.003
I miss all of you.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.570
We miss you, too.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.529
Mm, that'’s nice to hear.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.620
Well, not the reason I came by.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.230
I just want to give a heads up.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.754
We may be sending
you a life-changing case.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.364
- I'm listening.
- Randall Mack.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.583
Life in prison.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.106
He claims he was falsely accused

09:02.150 --> 09:05.457
and wrongly convicted
of murder 20 years ago.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.764
We just granted an order

09:07.808 --> 09:09.940
to show cause
on a habeas petition.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.725
And what was the reason?

09:13.857 --> 09:16.904
Uh, well, the only
eyewitness, Damien Owens,

09:16.947 --> 09:18.688
has recanted his testimony,

09:18.732 --> 09:20.864
now saying
that he committed the murder.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.345
Wasn't that enough
to correct the writ?

09:23.388 --> 09:24.651
His credibility is at issue.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.566
He'’s saying
that he lied under oath

09:26.609 --> 09:29.046
during the trial
against his best friend.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.963
As I recall, Mr. Owens
had difficulty testifying.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.443
And how would you know?

09:34.486 --> 09:36.793
I was just about
to tell you that

09:37.881 --> 09:40.275
Thomas was the presiding judge.

09:48.762 --> 09:49.632
Okay.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.722
Wow, your--
your dad painted all of these?

09:52.766 --> 09:54.942
Well,
he'’s had a lot of time.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.813
Yeah.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.598
Now, that'’s
my dad with Damien and Joe.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.382
They met in first grade

10:00.425 --> 10:01.862
and were friends
all through high school.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.646
Do you know what happened?

10:03.690 --> 10:05.822
Damien was in love with my mom.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.999
And when she married dad,
he took it really hard.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.088
Saw it as this huge betrayal.

10:11.698 --> 10:16.224
Joe tried to mend things,
but it was never the same.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.834
Mm.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.836
Jealousy'’s a powerful motivator.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.924
Mm.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.752
Okay, but I do
have some good news.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.885
Judge Carmichael
has agreed to expedite

10:24.928 --> 10:26.756
the evidentiary hearing.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.890
And this time tomorrow,
your dad could be a free man.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
That's amazing.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.764
Thank you. Thank you.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.680
Sorry. One second.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.551
Oh, no problem.
Hello?

10:39.595 --> 10:41.379
Yes, this is Emily Lopez.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.775
What?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.739
No. Thank you.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.919
What's happened?

10:58.962 --> 11:01.530
Damien Owens
developed an infection.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.664
He died an hour ago.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.938
The order from
the Court of Appeal

11:17.981 --> 11:19.287
was to take
Mr. Owen's testimony.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.810
We obviously cannot do that now.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.117
So there's no reason for
this hearing to move forward.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.858
I still
have Mr. Owens'’ affidavit,

11:24.901 --> 11:26.773
which was made
under penalty of perjury.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.036
Your Honor,
the affidavit is hearsay

11:29.079 --> 11:30.951
and the rules of evidence apply.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.910
There's no hearsay exception,
and so it is inadmissible.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.304
Your Honor,
Mr. Owens affidavit qualifies

11:36.347 --> 11:38.567
as a dying declaration.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.134
And if the court
finds that it does not meet

11:40.177 --> 11:42.223
the hearsay exception,
then the affidavit

11:42.266 --> 11:45.661
should be admitted into evidence
under the Chambers'’ case.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.315
Without Mr. Owens
statement being subject

11:47.358 --> 11:50.231
to cross-examination,
there is no way to determine

11:50.274 --> 11:51.580
if the statement is reliable.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.103
Ms. Palmer has a good point.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.497
Ms. Lopez, permission
to speak to your client?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.194
Of course, Your Honor.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.587
Mr. Mack,

11:59.588 --> 12:00.937
I want you to be aware

12:00.981 --> 12:02.809
that this
is an informal questioning

12:02.852 --> 12:05.507
- and you're not under oath.
- I understand, Your Honor.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.162
Mr. Mack, were you
or anyone in your family

12:08.205 --> 12:11.034
in contact with
Mr. Owens prior to his death?

12:11.078 --> 12:13.907
Yes, my daughter, Talisha.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.212
Thank you.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.781
Ms. Mack,
you are not under oath.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.609
Would you please tell
the court about

12:20.652 --> 12:22.132
your contact
with Mr. Owens?

12:22.176 --> 12:24.787
I heard Damien was sick.
I went to see him.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.312
Told me stories about
my dad and their friendship.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.098
I simply asked him
to tell what really happened.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.882
And did he tell you?

12:32.926 --> 12:35.885
No. It was only later
I learned about his affidavit.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.932
Your Honor, the Court
of Appeals had the affidavit

12:38.975 --> 12:41.499
and nevertheless
ordered an evidentiary hearing.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.980
They could have granted
a writ based on the affidavit

12:44.024 --> 12:46.069
if that alone was sufficient.
Your Honor.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.246
I know that I can
find additional evidence

12:49.290 --> 12:51.858
to prove Mr. Owens
testified falsely at trial.

12:51.901 --> 12:55.644
I just-- I just need some time.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.871
Ms. Lopez, I need a proposal

13:04.914 --> 13:07.830
from you for how
much time you need, and why.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.702
Ms. Palmer, find
authority for why this court

13:10.746 --> 13:12.226
cannot expand the order.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.968
All parties
are ordered back tomorrow.

13:19.102 --> 13:22.497
Randall, I know that Damien
was mad about the marriage,

13:22.540 --> 13:25.892
but was there anything else?

13:27.458 --> 13:28.851
Uh, no.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.853
Look, we were growing apart

13:30.897 --> 13:32.942
long before I married Etta.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.075
'Cause Damien had gotten
into some bad shit.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.728
I didn'’t want
nothin'’ to do with it.

13:36.772 --> 13:37.904
That's why
I only hung out with him

13:37.947 --> 13:39.862
- and Joe at the bar.
- Define bad.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.516
Damien was hanging
out with some sketchy dudes

13:41.559 --> 13:44.693
and that KC Smith,
that victim, he was one of '‘em.

13:45.912 --> 13:49.829
Randall, if you knew
that Damien was into bad stuff,

13:49.872 --> 13:52.048
then why keep
going back to the bar?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.015
He was my friend.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.756
For a long time.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.455
It's hard to let that go.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.938
I went over the case file.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.985
I'm curious about
a woman named Julia Barnes.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.901
She was on the witness list,
but she never testified.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.816
Oh, um...

14:22.296 --> 14:23.906
She was a coworker.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.039
And my lawyer was trying to get

14:26.082 --> 14:27.649
anybody he could to testify

14:27.692 --> 14:29.477
- as a character witness.
- Then why didn't she

14:29.520 --> 14:30.652
testify to your character?

14:30.695 --> 14:32.697
Mm, I dunno.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.878
Okay.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.882
Is there uh, is there
anything I can get you?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.535
Some painting supplies.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.581
Yeah.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.105
Going a little crazy
in here with nothing to do.

14:49.149 --> 14:52.195
Oh, yeah. Talisha
showed me your paintings.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.849
They are beautiful.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.546
My favorite
memories were at the beach.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.027
- Did you go a lot?
- Never been.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.768
Got all those photos

14:59.811 --> 15:01.988
I found in the magazines,
in the library.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.077
I always wanted to take
Talisha to see the ocean.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.775
Never got the chance.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.089
Maggie Palmer has a point.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.352
If the affidavit
alone was enough, we would

15:18.395 --> 15:20.920
have granted the petition
and saved you the trouble.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.923
So now that Mr. Owens has died,
do I...

15:24.445 --> 15:28.101
allow Ms. Lopez to introduce
any new evidence she can find?

15:29.145 --> 15:32.061
I know how wrongful convictions
keep you up at night.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.759
So that's code for
"trust your gut."

15:36.196 --> 15:37.240
Thank you, Lisa.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.764
Any time, Carmichael.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.072
I'’ll see you on the flip side.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.904
Hello!

15:48.948 --> 15:51.646
More beautiful
flowers from your garden?

15:51.689 --> 15:54.040
No! These were
delivered for you.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.172
What?

15:56.216 --> 15:57.652
I'm worried they're from Dre.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.176
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.136
They are not from him.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.573
- Uh, "Diapers to Diplomas?"
- Ha!

16:06.182 --> 16:08.010
"Excited to introduce you to--

16:08.054 --> 16:10.056
our wonderful world of nannies!"

16:10.099 --> 16:12.101
Oh! So Robin's
going back to work.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.016
Part time.
But if I know the man,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.148
he'll be full time by next week.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.673
Oh.
Sounds like somebody I know.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.973
God.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.980
"To my loving son, Edwin.

17:05.024 --> 17:10.507
I leave the Cape Cod and
Bel Air homes and all furniture.

17:10.551 --> 17:17.166
Now, the Van Gogh, I leave
along with our family ring,

17:17.514 --> 17:22.171
to my granddaughter, Mindy."

17:24.086 --> 17:25.609
Grandmother
promised me that ring.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.439
"All my clothes
along with my Mercedes,

17:29.874 --> 17:31.093
- "box of..."
- Are you sure?

17:31.137 --> 17:32.790
Yes. It means the world to me.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.096
please do something.

17:34.140 --> 17:37.143
- "My Baby Grand..."
- Please!

17:38.144 --> 17:40.276
Please!

17:40.320 --> 17:41.234
We object!

17:46.152 --> 17:48.241
Now, these smash
and grabs are well thought out.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.331
They aren't random, many of
them contain the same kids.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.984
What, you think one
of these kids is capable

17:53.028 --> 17:55.074
- of organizing all these hits?
- Possibly.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.814
The ones
I'’ve spoken with are smart,

17:56.858 --> 17:59.252
just not cooperating.
They're scared of somethin'’.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.427
Or someone.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.604
I've done everything
I can to get these kids to talk.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.779
Nothing.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.435
This kid, he's in juvie
fighting a murder charge.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.090
I know his lawyer,
Luke Watkins. I'll talk to him.

18:13.483 --> 18:16.225
- I knew you're up to something.
- Oh, take a breath.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.575
No, you hated my father and now
you're letting it out on me.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.490
Just accept your grandmother
loved Mindy more than you.

18:20.534 --> 18:24.059
- Grandmother promised me--
- Excuse me, what is going on?

18:24.494 --> 18:26.148
Excuse me, what is going on?

18:26.192 --> 18:28.237
- She had a change of heart--
- What is going on!

18:29.325 --> 18:32.415
The no contest
was made quite clear.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.982
Yes, I am aware.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.549
Apparently
your associate wasn't.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.681
Ms. Johnson advised
your client to contest the will.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.944
Not only does she forfeit
her entire inheritance,

18:39.988 --> 18:41.207
she must pay
back her advancement

18:41.250 --> 18:43.209
her grandmother
gave her for college.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.827
Oh, my God, that's $400,000.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.960
I don't have that kind of money.

18:56.004 --> 18:59.138
I will make this right, Ada.
I promise.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.187
Andre told us
it was a no contest.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.320
I know.
But Ada was in my ear.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.626
I didn't think. I just reacted.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.020
Can she really lose everything?

19:12.063 --> 19:14.153
Yes, it's a clause
specifically designed

19:14.196 --> 19:16.677
to discourage disgruntled
relatives from complaining.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.287
I'm sorry.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.377
- What do we do now?
- Ugh.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.902
We need to find
the proof for what we contested.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.308
Heard about Damien Owens.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.224
Your job just got a lot easier.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.618
No, now I have
to decide whether to allow

19:44.661 --> 19:47.360
the defense time to track
down additional evidence.

19:47.403 --> 19:50.363
Well, you had one affidavit
from a man who's now dead.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.365
It seems as if you feel
that Damien Owens was telling

19:52.408 --> 19:54.976
the truth without
hearing a shred of evidence.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.108
A man's freedom is at stake.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.459
I think it's worth
exploring all angles.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.026
Did you not read the uh,
transcript from the first trial?

20:02.070 --> 20:03.245
I did.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.942
Then you know
there's other evidence

20:04.986 --> 20:07.075
- besides Owen's testimony.
- I do.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.903
Then I fail to see the need

20:08.946 --> 20:11.384
for your exploring all angles.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.224
Ms. Rodriguez,
thank you so much for coming

20:25.267 --> 20:27.356
to the HOJ to meet me,
I just need to clarify

20:27.400 --> 20:29.489
a few things
about your testimony.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.012
You were the bartender.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.361
And it was you
who broke up a fight

20:32.405 --> 20:34.494
- between Randall and the victim?
- Yeah.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.539
Any idea what started the fight?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
That was so long ago.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.109
Yeah. You said later
that same night,

20:41.152 --> 20:43.067
you saw Randall
with the victim again?

20:43.111 --> 20:45.461
Uh, in the parking lot, arguing.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.333
Was Damien there that night?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.335
Yeah, he was there most nights.

20:49.378 --> 20:52.338
Is it possible the man
you saw in the parking lot

20:52.381 --> 20:54.253
was actually Damien Owens?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.168
No, no, it was
definitely Randall.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.083
Well, it was dark, right?

20:59.127 --> 21:00.998
- Yeah.
- So how can you be sure?

21:01.042 --> 21:02.696
I don't understand.
What's going on?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.220
Damien Owens
confessed to the murder,

21:05.264 --> 21:08.092
but he died before
he could be cross-examined.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.051
Oh, my God.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.487
Mm-hm.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.533
But are
you saying I was the one--

21:13.576 --> 21:15.491
No, I'm not--
No one's blaming you.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.406
I'm just looking
for any new evidence.

21:19.103 --> 21:23.325
Um, Randall was
hanging with this woman

21:23.369 --> 21:24.544
that wasn't his wife.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.155
Uh, she was there most nights.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.678
Jill-- Julie?

21:29.113 --> 21:30.506
Did you talk to her?

21:33.204 --> 21:35.511
Was Julia Barnes
at the bar that night?

21:35.555 --> 21:38.035
- Doesn't matter now.
- Yes, it does.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.907
It actually matters a lot.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.691
Who is she?

21:42.170 --> 21:43.476
She's someone that I loved.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.130
Someone I thought loved me.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.089
So you were having an affair?

21:48.132 --> 21:49.569
I wasn't proud of it.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.397
My wife and I
were having problems.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.399
And I knew I was wrong, just...

21:54.487 --> 21:56.402
Oh, Julia.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.361
I had to.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.841
Then why didn't she testify?

22:00.884 --> 22:03.452
Been asking myself
that same question for 20 years.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.237
She talked to my lawyer.
She told him everything.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.327
Then she changed her mind,
said that if he tried

22:08.370 --> 22:09.415
to make her talk, she'd lie.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.460
Almost killed me,
when I found out.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.333
We talked about
a future together.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.641
Then she left me to rot in hell.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.470
Well, I need to convince
Julia to come forward.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.429
- Oh, no, no--
- Randall,

22:23.472 --> 22:25.909
if Judge Carmichael
denies Damien's affidavit--

22:25.953 --> 22:28.303
Talisha doesn't know.
She'’d never forgive me.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.306
There's gotta
be another way, Ms. Lopez.

22:31.350 --> 22:36.572
Please. Please.
T is all I've got.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.575
What about Joe?

22:40.402 --> 22:41.577
He was
with Damien that night.

22:41.621 --> 22:42.839
He knows what the truth is.

22:42.883 --> 22:45.189
We are looking for Joe.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.366
He left L.A. when
he got out of prison, so.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.370
So if we can't find him,

22:52.806 --> 22:54.851
then Julia may be our only hope.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.078
<i>Hello, wife.</i>

23:04.121 --> 23:06.559
- Where are you, husband?
- On a stakeout.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.778
<i>I thought</i> <i>
you were doing computer work.</i>

23:08.822 --> 23:10.214
Wait, where is Bailey?

23:10.258 --> 23:11.868
<i>Robin Taylor.</i>

23:11.912 --> 23:14.567
<i>I know you did not take</i> <i>
our daughter on a stakeout.</i>

23:14.610 --> 23:16.438
I didn't
have a choice, honey.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.744
The babysitter canceled.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.528
You should have called me.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.312
<i>She'’s fine, Lo.</i> <i>
Ain'’t you, baby?</i>

23:21.356 --> 23:22.879
<i>I still don't like it.</i>

23:22.923 --> 23:26.666
Ah, I guess it's time
to put Operation Nanny Search

23:26.709 --> 23:28.668
into warp speed.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.285
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.026
Thanks for coming by.

23:40.723 --> 23:41.811
- Listen--
- Before we start,

23:41.855 --> 23:42.943
I just want to say--

23:44.335 --> 23:45.989
Really rough, right?

23:46.033 --> 23:47.469
So rough.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.731
Don't ever want to do it again.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.472
This, Watkins,
is why you never should

23:50.516 --> 23:52.256
have left the DA's office.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.608
If you and Amy can
maintain a relationship

23:55.651 --> 23:57.479
after some of the epic
battles that you've had,

23:57.523 --> 23:58.785
I'm sure that we can mend.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.221
Vegas rules, baby.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.005
What happens
in the court room...

24:02.049 --> 24:03.180
Deal.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.617
We good?

24:07.533 --> 24:09.012
Oh, hey, before you go.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.493
I actually did call
you over here for a reason.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.713
Anyone look familiar?

24:14.191 --> 24:15.497
Miles Pallo, my client.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.933
He was certified down to juvie

24:16.977 --> 24:18.674
on the robbery case
where the victim died.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.068
Before that robbery,
he was involved in several other

24:21.111 --> 24:23.592
burglaries all attached
to the smash and grab ring.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.376
- Okay, and?
- Maggie is gonna file

24:25.420 --> 24:26.552
additional charges.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.075
She's also pushing to have him

24:28.118 --> 24:29.511
transferred to adult court.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.819
So just talk to him,
see if he'’ll cooperate--

24:32.862 --> 24:34.168
What are you looking for?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.561
I think there's
a mastermind

24:35.604 --> 24:37.693
behind the smash and grabs,
I need a name--

24:37.737 --> 24:39.521
- You want my client to snitch?
- Well, would you rather

24:39.565 --> 24:40.914
he get transferred
straight to prison

24:40.957 --> 24:42.219
when he's out of juvie?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.394
'Cause that's where he's going

24:43.438 --> 24:45.048
if he keeps down this route.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.879
I'll talk to my client.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.148
The Court will not
receive into evidence

24:58.192 --> 25:00.150
Damien Owens' affidavit.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.849
On balance, the court
does not believe Mr. Owens

25:02.892 --> 25:05.373
was on the verge of death
at the time of the statement,

25:05.416 --> 25:08.289
and thus it is
not a dying declaration

25:08.332 --> 25:10.509
as contemplated
in the evidence code.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.208
However, based
on that affidavit,

25:14.643 --> 25:16.776
I will provide
the defense with more time

25:16.819 --> 25:19.735
to find evidence
that supports his main point,

25:19.779 --> 25:22.085
that Mr. Mack did
not commit the crime.

25:23.304 --> 25:26.176
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- We'’ll reconvene in two days.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.570
Parties are ordered to appear.

25:36.970 --> 25:39.276
Hello?
- Daddy?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.582
Sherri said
it was okay to come in.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.760
Of course it's okay to come in.

25:45.239 --> 25:48.155
Hello, my sweet baby girl.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.636
We were
on our way to the museum.

25:50.679 --> 25:53.377
Thought, why not
pop in and see you first?

25:53.421 --> 25:54.814
Thank you, daddy.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.688
Tough case?

26:00.384 --> 26:01.647
Yes.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.432
And...

26:04.998 --> 26:07.261
Andre Armstrong is in town.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.045
Do you even remember him?

26:09.829 --> 26:12.179
I remember he was a damn fool.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.877
I think you're thinkin'’
of somebody else.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.664
Wasn't that the guy who chose
his career over you?

26:18.707 --> 26:22.058
How do you even remember
that after all this time?

26:22.102 --> 26:23.582
He broke your heart.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.585
A father never
forgets something like that.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.895
So, why is it
a problem he's here?

26:33.635 --> 26:35.811
He wants to catch up.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.639
Lo.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.642
Put the past where it belongs.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.258
I never
thought they'd convict him.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.825
But they did.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.480
And you sat on
the truth for 20 years.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.786
I couldn't ruin my life.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.310
And what about Randall's life?

26:57.659 --> 27:00.183
Julia, you've
allowed an innocent man

27:00.227 --> 27:02.490
to suffer
in prison for 20 years.

27:02.795 --> 27:06.102
This is a man you cared about.
A good man.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.714
With a family, a career.

27:08.757 --> 27:09.889
You wouldn't understand.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.805
No, I-- I don't.
So please, tell me.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.721
It's not that easy.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.506
I never told my
husband about the affair.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.595
He wouldn't understand.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.902
I don't-- I don't care. I don't.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.643
Because this
isn't about your husband

27:24.686 --> 27:25.992
and it's not
about your marriage.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.864
This is about
an innocent man's life.

27:29.952 --> 27:33.652
So stop making
Randall pay for your guilt.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.352
I have to think about it.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.311
You--

27:55.848 --> 27:57.763
Did you know that the will
was amended three months ago?

27:58.633 --> 28:00.417
Specifically
the personal property memo?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.332
No.
Did you find the original?

28:02.376 --> 28:03.725
Yeah. I called
the court records,

28:03.769 --> 28:05.553
and tracked it down.
Ada was right.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.642
Her grandmother
promised her that ring.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.037
Perhaps, Ada isn't
being honest with us.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.734
Families do fall out.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
And I saw her face.
She had no idea.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.869
No. Something happened
three months ago that made her

28:16.912 --> 28:18.522
grandmother change
her mind about that will,

28:19.001 --> 28:20.699
and I'm gonna
find out what it was.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.050
Okay.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.792
Ms. Lopez,

28:26.835 --> 28:28.881
you've requested
another continuance.

28:28.924 --> 28:30.665
What is the basis
for the motion?

28:30.709 --> 28:31.884
I am having trouble securing

28:31.927 --> 28:33.755
the attendance
of a critical witness.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.235
I have sent out a subpoena,

28:35.278 --> 28:37.411
- but I'm worried she won't show.
- Who's the witness?

28:37.454 --> 28:39.152
Julia Barnes.
She was with Randall Mack

28:39.195 --> 28:40.762
at the time of the murder.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.546
Her testimony
can prove his innocence.

28:42.590 --> 28:44.113
Why do you think she won'’t show?

28:44.157 --> 28:46.159
Because she was on the original
witness list and didn't.

28:46.202 --> 28:49.075
Be assured Ms. Lopez, if
you serve her with a subpoena,

28:49.118 --> 28:50.511
I will issue a body attachment

28:50.554 --> 28:51.947
for her if she fails to appear.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.775
But we both know that

28:53.819 --> 28:55.908
that is not a guarantee
that she will testify.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.866
Are there any other witnesses?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.825
Joe Loffton. He was
an accessory after the fact.

29:00.477 --> 29:03.089
Isn't he also
a friend of Mr. Mack's?

29:03.132 --> 29:05.178
Was. Joe now lives in Tampa

29:05.221 --> 29:07.441
and apparently
he is out at sea, fishing,

29:07.484 --> 29:09.269
so it may take us
a while to reach him.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.839
Ms. Palmer, are the people ready
for the evidentiary hearing?

29:13.882 --> 29:15.797
We are, Your Honor.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.758
Ms. Lopez, I am
allowing your continuance.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.760
The hearing will
now begin in three days.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.956
Yes. Dr. Sullivan? Yes.

29:43.999 --> 29:47.916
This is Vanessa Johnson
from Audubon and Quinn Law Firm.

29:48.308 --> 29:52.616
Yeah. I need some information
on a patient that you had.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.881
Does Miles know he's facing
a possible prison sentence?

29:55.924 --> 29:58.361
He's more scared of retaliation
than he is prison.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.842
Said we don't know
who we're dealing with.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.409
We could offer him protection.

30:02.452 --> 30:03.889
We could
relocate him if need be.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.716
Yeah,
just what every teen wants,

30:05.760 --> 30:07.588
to have their life
completely uprooted.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.852
I'll let my client know.

30:11.374 --> 30:12.854
Thank you for helping out.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.290
I'm doing this
purely for my client.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.901
Feels good, though, doesn't it?
I gotta go.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.554
- Run tomorrow?
- See ya at seven.

30:17.598 --> 30:18.860
Hey! Here to see Maggie.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.166
I just finished with Mark.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.081
Oh, which means things are good.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.952
Yeah, all good.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.434
Good. Oh!
Look what I'’ve got.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.739
Oh!
- Tomorrow,

30:28.783 --> 30:30.437
that apartment is gonna be mine.

30:32.265 --> 30:33.701
Good luck.

30:33.744 --> 30:34.920
That's right, Watkins.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.922
- Pretend you don't see me.
- You rang?

30:37.748 --> 30:39.838
It's obvious Judge
Cuddly Do Right is going to keep

30:39.881 --> 30:41.927
granting you continuances
until I grow old.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.103
I don't have
the time or patience for a case

30:44.146 --> 30:46.409
the previous
defense obviously fucked up.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.542
Voluntary
manslaughter time served.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.109
Mr. Mack can walk tomorrow.

30:55.157 --> 30:58.073
They're on their
way up here right now, but...

30:58.682 --> 31:00.075
Gonna want to see this.

31:03.209 --> 31:04.775
Are these for real?

31:04.819 --> 31:06.516
Yes. I first noticed them

31:06.560 --> 31:08.083
when Ada showed me a photo.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.172
Thank you for coming.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.218
There are a few issues
I'd like to clear up.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.655
About what?
Everything seems in order.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.918
Oh, bear
with me, Mr. James.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.747
Could I please see the ring?

31:22.010 --> 31:23.794
Thank you.
I'd asked Wendell to send me

31:23.838 --> 31:26.667
a picture of the ring
and I notice

31:26.710 --> 31:28.930
a new spring
had been molded to the inside.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.106
This is often done
to resize a ring in order

31:31.150 --> 31:34.196
not to lose any
of its intricate details.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.069
Would you please try this on?

31:39.810 --> 31:41.116
Oh. Too small.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.118
Mother fitted
that ring a year ago.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.947
Mindy has
picked up weight since.

31:45.991 --> 31:51.910
Well, actually I grabbed these
from Mindy's Twitter page and--

31:53.041 --> 31:54.825
it appears
over the last three years,

31:54.869 --> 31:56.523
Mindy'’s changed very little.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.527
Would you please try this on?

32:03.443 --> 32:06.837
Mother simply had
a change of heart. Nothing more.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.840
Perhaps you'd like
to see some other photos

32:09.884 --> 32:11.930
my associate found.

32:13.192 --> 32:17.022
These were taken three months
before Grandmother died,

32:17.065 --> 32:19.676
which happens to coincide
with the changes

32:19.720 --> 32:21.548
made to the will,

32:21.591 --> 32:23.942
that was electronically signed.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.553
How could you hurt grandmother?

32:26.596 --> 32:28.947
Utter nonsense. I would never--

32:29.643 --> 32:31.166
You cannot prove any of this.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.300
You're right.

32:34.343 --> 32:37.303
Elder abuse is incredibly
difficult to prove.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.044
Which is why I called

32:39.087 --> 32:41.263
Deputy District Attorney
Mark Callan.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.144
Keep the damn ring.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.326
I'm really sorry, Ada.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.155
It'’s okay.
I know it wasn't you, Min.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.551
Thank you so much.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.120
I'm going to be
singing your praises to Andre.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.170
Callan,
What are you doing here?

33:19.432 --> 33:21.216
Did you just use me?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
Don't know what you mean.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.615
What if I don't take it?

33:28.658 --> 33:30.530
If Judge Carmichael
rules against us

33:30.573 --> 33:34.055
at the evidentiary hearing, you
go back to prison indefinitely.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.970
- Do we have a chance?
- Yes.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.580
We are very
close to finding Joe.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.147
And if Julia doesn't show,

33:39.191 --> 33:41.584
then Judge Carmichael
will issue an arrest warrant.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.064
You talked to Julia?

33:43.108 --> 33:44.848
I had to, Randall.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.372
Is she gonna help me?

33:46.415 --> 33:47.764
I don't know.

33:52.552 --> 33:55.685
Twenty years later,
she's still breaking my heart.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.125
I know this is a hard decision.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.348
What would you do?

34:20.797 --> 34:23.670
I've made my decision.
Accept the offer.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.155
Ms. Lopez.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.941
- Is that it?
- Yes.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.206
You don't have to take the plea.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.339
- Is it Julia? She here?
- No. Randall--

34:40.382 --> 34:43.777
All rise.
Court is now in session.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.261
You may be seated.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.655
I was informed
the People made an offer.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.179
- Yes, Your Honor--
- Uh, Your Honor,

34:54.222 --> 34:58.052
Mr. Mack respectfully rejects
the People's offer.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.228
The defense has located
Joe Loffton, Your Honor.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.274
And has his sworn statement
that it was Damien Owens

35:02.317 --> 35:05.364
who committed the murder
my client was convicted of.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.280
Your Honor, we spent
the last week discussing

35:08.323 --> 35:11.761
how a signed document
isn't admissible evidence.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.285
The court can't just admit

35:13.328 --> 35:15.156
a signed piece
of paper for the truth.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.028
Except in very
limited circumstances.

35:18.246 --> 35:21.771
Thank you. Ms. Lopez,
why did it take Mr. Loffton

35:21.815 --> 35:23.382
twenty years to come forward?

35:23.773 --> 35:27.212
Fear, Your Honor. Damien Owens
threatened Joe'’s family.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.214
Joe just found out
about Damien's death

35:29.257 --> 35:31.346
and he wants
to do right by my client.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.175
He says that he's
willing to testify if needed.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.570
Ms. Palmer, how do
the people wish to proceed?

35:37.613 --> 35:39.093
Your Honor.

35:46.318 --> 35:49.843
This new evidence corroborates
Damien Owens'’ affidavit.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.366
The people are
no longer confident

35:51.410 --> 35:54.108
we could prove the case
beyond reasonable doubt.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.240
Therefore...

35:55.762 --> 35:57.807
we are
withdrawing our opposition

35:57.851 --> 36:00.070
to the habeas petition and...

36:00.332 --> 36:03.813
agree the conviction
should be vacated.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.859
If the people are no longer

36:05.902 --> 36:07.208
contesting the writ,
then this court

36:07.252 --> 36:10.342
will return this
case to the Court of Appeal

36:10.385 --> 36:12.431
and recommend
that the writ be granted.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.954
Mr. Mack.

36:16.391 --> 36:19.829
You are released
on your own recognizance.

36:20.569 --> 36:21.701
Thank you, Your Honor.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.399
Mr. Mack,
I would like to apologize

36:25.052 --> 36:26.793
on behalf of the court.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.317
Today is a bittersweet moment.

36:29.361 --> 36:32.712
There is much
to celebrate in that justice

36:32.755 --> 36:34.409
has finally been served.

36:34.453 --> 36:38.326
But there's so much
disappointment and sadness

36:38.370 --> 36:39.980
that it took so long.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.940
This court is adjourned.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.248
Baby, you did it!

36:47.292 --> 36:49.859
You're free daddy.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.390
Is it over?

36:58.433 --> 36:59.869
It's over.

37:03.046 --> 37:04.483
How do I begin?

37:05.310 --> 37:07.312
Randall, you're not
going to be alone in this. Okay?

37:07.355 --> 37:10.140
Talisha and I will be
there every step of the way.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.273
I'm going to set
meetings for you,

37:12.317 --> 37:14.275
help you find
a job and a place to live.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.885
But for now...

37:15.929 --> 37:17.278
You're going to stay with me,

37:17.322 --> 37:18.975
for as long as you want, daddy.

37:19.802 --> 37:23.763
I will file for compensation
for wrongful conviction.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.373
That is happening.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.463
Um...

37:33.903 --> 37:37.037
Until it comes in,
this might help.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.299
You don't have to

37:38.343 --> 37:40.301
do that-- Oh, Daddy!

37:40.693 --> 37:44.044
It'’s not a lot but
I want you to have it, okay?

37:44.087 --> 37:45.567
It's yours.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.268
Thank you.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.313
You'’re welcome.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.010
And I know
it's been a long road,

37:54.750 --> 37:59.538
you'’re tired but there's this
one last thing I need us to do.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.204
Congratulations.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.862
It is quite satisfying,
when justice is served.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.125
After our earlier conversations,

38:22.169 --> 38:23.866
that is not
the reaction I was expecting.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.042
Well, our system of justice
can only be reinforced

38:26.086 --> 38:27.348
by thoughtful debate.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.612
You and I may
not always agree,

38:30.656 --> 38:34.050
but we must be assured that as
long as you wear that robe,

38:34.616 --> 38:36.488
you will always have my respect.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.926
Thank you, Judge Marshall.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.242
Hey, it's the goose.

38:52.286 --> 38:55.420
Goo, goo. Goo, goo.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.213
Then you use the other
hand, boom, boom, boom.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.349
Hey, wife.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.351
Hey, husband.

39:15.614 --> 39:17.093
Mm...

39:18.443 --> 39:20.532
I think we found our nanny.

39:22.577 --> 39:23.578
Really?

39:24.753 --> 39:26.320
Okay.

39:28.409 --> 39:32.413
Daddy, we have
something that we would like

39:32.457 --> 39:33.588
to discuss with you.

39:35.242 --> 39:38.593
What do you think about you
and mama bein'’ Bailey's nanny?

39:41.161 --> 39:44.469
I'’m touched.
But we have to decline.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.428
Don't you need to discuss
this with mama first?

39:47.472 --> 39:49.387
I know exactly what she'll say.

39:49.996 --> 39:53.260
Being a nanny is a job.
We love being grandparents.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.305
It's more fun.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.439
Here, there you go. Go to daddy.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.401
You know what this means?

40:03.444 --> 40:06.404
Hmm. Let the nanny search begin.
