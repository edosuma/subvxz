WEBVTT

00:15.850 --> 00:17.966
No, no, no, no, no.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.651
Hey, it's Bo.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.317
[knocking]

00:34.076 --> 00:36.453
[RYAN] Hey. Oh!

00:36.537 --> 00:37.777
Upstairs. Now.

00:37.872 --> 00:40.284
Did you forget we aren't right for
each other and it's complicated?

00:40.374 --> 00:43.866
And, wow. It's like you only
got one thing on your mind.

00:43.961 --> 00:44.996
I do.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.372
Oh.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.629
You realize that none of my doctorates
are in that medical stuff, right?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.834
I mean, in fact,
most of them are made up.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.089
I need to heal.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.546
Yeah, you look like hell.

00:56.641 --> 00:59.223
You should see the Underfae
that tried to kill me.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.352
Sex. Now.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.182
Right, succubus. Shall we?

01:23.209 --> 01:27.543
Ahh!

01:46.941 --> 01:49.227
You said free gift with purchase.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.936
Yeah, I should have smelled religious
freak all over you and slammed the door.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.193
lam not here on behalf of religion.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.401
lam here on behalf of your faith.

01:59.495 --> 02:02.612
My faith? Well, that's easy--
I don't got none.

02:02.707 --> 02:06.416
I don't believe in anything
except Jimmy Beam.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.835
| worship him alone.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.413
All your neighbours
have become followers.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.214
They'd be pleased to welcome you.

02:14.302 --> 02:18.341
No. I don't know them
and I don't want to.

02:18.431 --> 02:21.264
See, | don't--| don't like people.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.341
So...

02:28.774 --> 02:30.480
Behold.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.903
That's beautiful.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.909
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.912
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.915
My love carries a death sentence.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.088
l was lost for years,

02:54.175 --> 02:56.837
searching, while hiding,

02:56.927 --> 03:01.091
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:01.182 --> 03:06.051
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.567
Wow! I mean, you really know
how to make a guy feel wanted.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.817
Oh, come on.

03:19.909 --> 03:23.367
You are always happy
to skip cuddly spoon hour.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.241
Besides, you're the one who told me
that post-orgasm claustrophobia

03:26.332 --> 03:28.698
was a medical condition.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.079
That was a joke.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.128
Now... now I want to spoon.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.422
I mean, really. Can we spoon?

03:36.509 --> 03:38.716
As long as you want. Come on.

03:38.803 --> 03:42.387
Well, what I want is for you to go.

03:43.849 --> 03:48.468
Look, look, I am--| am really happy
with your paramedic impression.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.769
But this is over.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.939
Okay, this--this is the last time--

03:54.026 --> 03:57.769
Oh, man, even I'm sick of that song.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.731
Thank god you have such
a beautiful voice. Now let's spoon.

04:01.826 --> 04:02.531
Right.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.032
Come on.

04:06.122 --> 04:07.328
--What?
--See ya.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.906
But I want to stay.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.958
Oh, come on, Bo, | just want to cuddle.

04:22.138 --> 04:24.504
[DYSON] You wanted to see me?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.929
Yes.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.305
There's a prisoner in the dungeon.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.809
His name's Acher. He's an Underfae.
I need you to interrogate him for me.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.810
What did he do?

04:38.320 --> 04:41.357
There have been a rash of
deaths among the Fae lately,

04:41.449 --> 04:42.939
all been ruled as suicide.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.069
I'm guessing there's
more to it than that.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.868
Cybelle, a Fae Elder, was poisoned.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.994
And last night, my bodyguard Petros

04:52.084 --> 04:54.700
was found at the bottom
of the Westgate viaduct.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.410
He fell twenty stories.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.041
And you don't think
he went voluntarily.

04:58.132 --> 05:03.297
No. He was guarding Acher's
cell earlier on in the day.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.343
I need answers, Dyson.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.046
As you wish.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.727
Dyson, be careful.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.644
I haven't told Acher
anything about you.

05:13.731 --> 05:16.188
I think it's wise to keep it that way.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.156
No, wait, no. See, I didn't
order any of this stuff.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.655
Matching lovebirds, a surfboard.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.579
What can I tell you? You've got
an admirer. Name of Ryan Lambert.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.451
That's gotta be some kind of mistake.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.998
No.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.755
Thanks.

05:47.097 --> 05:51.557
P Beautiful Bo-belle,
come back to me P

05:51.644 --> 05:56.934
"P Without you, my life
is one big tragedy P
--No. No, no, no, no.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.237
--Oh.
--Ah!

06:02.321 --> 06:05.313
There's a guy dressed like
a bellhop crying in our hallway.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.274
Yeah, it's a--it's tourism Fae.
He needed directions.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.486
--How are you?
--Hi. Well, on today's episode of Kenzi,

06:11.580 --> 06:15.414
our heroine's moxie is tested
when confronted by a stalker.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.082
Yeah, they're everywhere these days.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.002
Do you remember Tryst, that graffiti
artist I knew back in the day?

06:20.089 --> 06:21.295
Sure. Your old boyfriend?

06:21.382 --> 06:22.337
Oh, very funny.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.791
That wankster that was
completely obsessed with me and--

06:25.886 --> 06:27.092
[TRYST knocking] Kenz! Hey, Kenz!

06:27.179 --> 06:28.760
Please. Please.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.760
[TRYST] Yo. I'm looking for the offices
of Tryst's Angels. Where they be?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.933
They be cancelled!

06:39.316 --> 06:40.522
Don't play me, shorty.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.193
I need help. And I know
y'all be private girl dicks.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.147
And I know "y'all" be leaving.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.151
Oh, come on.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.405
There's a very special lady in my life.
She's in a world of pain right now.

06:51.495 --> 06:55.158
Oh, you got some poor girl knocked up?
Hm. Holy spit. | send my condolences.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.116
I'm talking about my gran-gran.
Who knocks up their gran-gran?

06:58.210 --> 07:00.371
Yech! So not where I meant to go.

07:00.462 --> 07:04.296
Okay, look, Tryst, we are
very busy with other clients.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.839
We're booked solid.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.417
Bobo, what the...?

07:09.471 --> 07:13.259
Later, okay? I mean, Tryst needs us.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.717
Shizzle, Kenzi, it--it be
his gran-gran. Right?

07:16.812 --> 07:21.431
Respect. That is why you are my
second favourite be-yotch. Biatch.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.685
Don't push it.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.485
Right. So, every Sunday,
my granny makes me supper.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.733
| always check out this little
telephone desk she's got.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.439
It's where she keeps her secret stuff.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.026
Anyway, turns out some
evil dude be changing her will.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.986
Now all her money's
going to some corporation.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.287
Her house, too.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.751
And she's too confused to
answer any questions about it.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.166
Way confused.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.335
Well, we'll see if we can help, okay?

07:43.422 --> 07:47.131
All right. Ah, street art don't pay,
so can we do this one for free?

07:47.217 --> 07:49.253
You know, what do you call it?

07:49.345 --> 07:51.210
Pro boner.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.801
Bo, where did you get all this stuff?

07:54.892 --> 07:58.430
It is all going back, okay? Put it down.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.976
--Put it down!
--No.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.396
--Kenzi!
--No.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.941
[GUARD] The key to the cell.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.989
Thank you.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.173
There's no point in hiding, Acher.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.172
[ACHER] Now how did the Ash
know I wanted a visitor?

08:33.263 --> 08:38.303
And a Celtic wolf pretending
he's still a police detective.

08:38.394 --> 08:42.262
Someone must think
I'm very special indeed.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.062
Am I supposed to be impressed?

08:44.149 --> 08:46.856
The smell of oil tells me you've
cleaned your handgun this morning.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.525
But you're not carrying
it where you would

08:48.612 --> 08:53.606
if you still had the authority to carry it.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.362
You're observant.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.829
One of my many talents.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.788
Why don't you come a little closer?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.627
I could use the companionship.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.252
I'm not here to be your friend.

09:14.638 --> 09:17.175
So, this was the address
on Gran-gran's cheque stubs.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.348
[KENZI] Strip mall church. Sexy.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.266
Just stick close.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.859
The love of Brother Douglas
must carry you.

09:30.946 --> 09:35.940
If you struggle, the rocks
'neath the surface will win.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.618
Brother, we are thirsty.

09:39.705 --> 09:44.950
And I shall slake your every desire.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.579
Okay.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.840
--Office. Cover me.
--O kay.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.432
[oohing]

10:26.001 --> 10:27.707
Hi. I'm Carla.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.126
Uh, Kendall.

10:29.213 --> 10:32.455
I am just here exploring
Dougallerianism.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.130
lsn't he incredible?

10:34.218 --> 10:36.960
He has changed my life.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.761
Come have some tea and cookies.
We'll tell you more about the creed.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.509
You know, I'm not really
here to stay, so--

10:41.600 --> 10:43.556
Oh, don't be silly.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.984
I love talking to people just like you.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.238
I love you already. Just like a sister.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.740
Okay, sis, well, thank you. But I'm a--

11:03.831 --> 11:06.868
Oh, and the cookies are
made from scratch. Go ahead.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.824
--O kay.
--O kay.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.877
What are you doing?

11:19.972 --> 11:21.303
You first.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.880
Why are people giving
you so much money?

11:22.975 --> 11:25.557
Offerings of thanksgiving and hope.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.930
Except it's more than they can afford.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.014
It is difficult for a non-believer
to grasp the generosity of others.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.442
Oh, good one. You read that
in a fortune cookie?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.939
You're very rude.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.318
No. Do you know what's rude
is taking people's houses and money

11:40.409 --> 11:42.741
to build a celebration centre,
when what you really want

11:42.828 --> 11:44.364
is for them to worship you.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.240
What is that sound?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.616
[water boiling]

11:47.708 --> 11:51.166
Usquebagh Smirr ta drookit au'herts.

11:51.253 --> 11:58.045
Usquebagh Smirr ta drookit au'herts.
Usquebagh Smirr ta drookit au'herts.

11:58.135 --> 12:02.128
--Usquebagh Smirr ta drookit au'herts.
--What...

12:02.222 --> 12:05.259
--Usquebagh Smirr ta drookit au'herts.
--Where am |?

12:05.350 --> 12:08.217
Yo, holy man.
Bo doesn't do water sports.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.768
Oh!

12:15.360 --> 12:18.443
And that concludes today's service.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.736
Bobo, you okay?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.563
Stay away from me!

12:24.745 --> 12:25.860
Bo!

12:25.954 --> 12:27.694
[BO] You stay away from me!

12:31.209 --> 12:32.665
Bo!

12:44.932 --> 12:46.843
How well did you know Petros?

12:46.934 --> 12:50.051
How well does anyone
really know anyone else?

12:51.772 --> 12:54.639
There are no natural
predators for a wolf.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.689
True?

12:56.777 --> 12:58.642
Except for humans, of course.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.695
You spoke to Petros on the day
he jumped. What did you talk about?

13:01.782 --> 13:05.195
No natural predators means
you're king of the animals.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.786
Do you feel invincible?

13:06.870 --> 13:07.985
Answer my question.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.538
Why? You won't answer me.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.001
I don't feel invincible
and neither should you.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.874
Fair enough.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.374
Petros and I spoke
about his sad little life.

13:21.468 --> 13:25.427
He was a simple man,
even by the lowest of standards.

13:25.514 --> 13:30.554
I can only imagine his life was
a series of brutal disappointments.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.431
Death probably came as a relief.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.012
He had a family.

13:35.107 --> 13:39.601
Is a lone wolf suggesting
family's a reason to live?

13:39.695 --> 13:41.686
I love the irony.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.520
Don't pretend to know me.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.402
But I do.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.576
Maybe better than you know yourself.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.871
Just like I knew Petros
better than most.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.165
Do you know that his wife left him?

13:55.252 --> 13:57.038
Women do that.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.916
After centuries,
he was suddenly single.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.544
It must have left him in
a lonely, lonely place,

14:02.634 --> 14:05.171
wondering if it was something he did.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.629
Wondering if, perhaps,
he didn't deserve joy.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.554
Did I strike a nerve, Detective?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.898
Trick. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

14:23.989 --> 14:24.899
What's the matter?

14:24.990 --> 14:27.072
I need your help. I lost Bo.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.990
Well, she ran away.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.193
Her bodacious brain
just went kerblooey.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.155
Okay, from the beginning and
as much English as you can manage.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.412
Okay. We were on a case
and we thought it was humans.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.539
Scammer preacher-type who we thought
might be stealing from old broads.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.588
But then Brother Jerk
threw some H20 at Bo and--

14:43.675 --> 14:45.006
Water? Just plain water?

14:45.093 --> 14:48.301
It looked like it. But it made her
act like some wide-eyed Dorothy-type

14:48.388 --> 14:51.721
and she didn't even
know me. I mean, me!

14:51.808 --> 14:54.220
Sounds like an Addonc.
They're a water Fae.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.302
They soak you and
your memory's erased.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.852
Like shaking an Etch-a-Sketch?

14:57.939 --> 15:02.729
Exactly. You revert back to a
blank slate, childlike, more innocent.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.105
And, like babies, people
who have been Addonced

15:05.197 --> 15:08.940
basically imprint onto the first
person who's been kind to them.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.524
Oh, no.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.110
Okay. Hey!

15:13.205 --> 15:16.197
Can you take over?
It's kind of an emergency.

15:16.291 --> 15:20.284
Bo isn't herself. She's not going
to have her own wits or skills.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.289
She might not even
know she's a succubus.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.123
Uh oh. If she gets hungry,
she could kill a whole NBA. team,

15:26.218 --> 15:29.335
with a W.N.B.A. team
for dessert. Let's go.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.943
[RYAN] Hey, gorgeous.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.813
Bo.

15:45.904 --> 15:46.814
Bo, wait.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.691
You are the second
person to call me that.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.148
Well, that's because it's your name.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.578
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.656
lt's Ryan.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.241
What do you mean you don't know me?

16:02.379 --> 16:05.621
I've been looking all over for you.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.171
Look, I can prove it to you.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.875
That bracelet you're
wearing, I gave it to you.

16:09.970 --> 16:16.466
It has an inscription, R-E-L-12-3-42.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.067
[TRICK] First step--any water
we find, we dump it.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.696
No way. If I find some, l'm pouring it
all over Ryan Gosling's beautiful melon.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.368
You! You assaulted me.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.740
I'm calling the police.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.288
It's not a good idea.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.084
They'll send Fae cops and I'll have to
tell them that you're a criminal Addonc.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.081
Who are you?

16:45.172 --> 16:48.289
Someone who knows
the trickery you're capable of.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.374
It is not trickery.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.881
| sell grace to those who badly need it.

16:53.972 --> 16:57.681
The black-haired woman
you splashed earlier, where is she?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.143
How should I know?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.138
She ran and didn't return.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.845
Before I had a chance to
wash out her filthy mouth

17:03.940 --> 17:06.272
and put her in a modest blouse.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.395
A blouse?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.863
You monster.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.814
We got to go. We're watching you.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.445
That's right, buddy.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.875
Hot chocolate with
extra whipped cream.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.294
It's the best remedy.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.496
You didn't have to do that.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.422
Sure, I did. I care about you.

17:31.509 --> 17:36.469
I'm okay. I just, um, I wish that
I could remember more.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.716
What?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.718
Was it raining?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.185
Today?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.351
Um, no. Why?

17:43.438 --> 17:46.350
I remember getting a bit wet.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.726
I'm sorry, I'm just--|'m confused.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.778
Are you cold? I'm so cold.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.357
Let me just help you, okay?

17:57.452 --> 17:59.693
--O kay.
--Come here.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.578
Oh!

18:04.334 --> 18:07.121
I'm sorry that I don't remember you.

18:07.212 --> 18:11.501
I, um, I really appreciate
you helping me though.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.218
--Wh at?
--Wow!

18:25.313 --> 18:26.473
Wow?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.520
--Wow, wow, wow!
--Wow!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.018
--No!
--What?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.691
No, we can't.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.688
--Why not?
--We can't.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.021
|t's--it's--it's too much.
It's too tempting.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.777
--I mean, sheesh.
--Yeah?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.653
--We could end up way over our heads.
--Yeah.

18:39.744 --> 18:45.284
I mean, maybe even
having, you know, S-E-X.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.866
You really don't remember
who you are, do you?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.417
No.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.665
You're my girlfriend.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.418
--I am?
--Yeah. We're in love.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.249
--We are?
--Madly.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.050
In fact, I've been planning
something for a little while now

18:58.138 --> 18:59.674
and I think this is the perfect time.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.016
The perfect time for what?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.307
Oh, wow. That is sparkly.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.180
Marry me.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.934
I want to be with you forever.
I need to be with you forever.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.769
We can be at the Falls in an hour.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.699
Why not? Yes.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.245
--Yes.
--Let's get married.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.914
Ooh.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.332
Oh, wow.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.703
The honeymoon suite, Mrs. Lambert.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.665
--Holy sugar. This is fancy.
--Yeah.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.217
Some industrialist's old country home.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.465
Nothing too good for my girl.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.305
You asked to fly my private
helicopter, | make it happen.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.808
That was your idea. And the most
terrifying twenty seconds

19:50.899 --> 19:52.514
--of my life.
--Oh, not even close.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.645
You've forgotten so much
incredible stuff, babe.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.977
Well, do you think
I'll ever remember it?

19:57.072 --> 20:01.486
I think that we'll just have
to make some new memories.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.567
Have your life begin
again as Mrs. Lambert.

20:03.661 --> 20:04.946
Could be a lot worse, huh?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.619
No.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.995
Stop calling me that, you bad man.
This isn't official yet.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.419
Listen, we could fix that
in fifteen minutes. Come on.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.495
I want a dress.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.707
What--she wants a dress.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.802
l was thinking, like,
ivory, crepe de chine.

20:22.889 --> 20:26.302
I don't even know what crepe de chine is,
but doesn't it sound delightful?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.429
|just--| want to be really pretty.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.262
Babe, you couldn't be any prettier.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.063
I would marry you in
hip waders and a space helmet.

20:34.150 --> 20:38.314
Well, no--well, you can
wear that if you want to.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.487
But I want a dress.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.865
What if Bo hitched a ride out of town

20:44.953 --> 20:48.662
and is dancing in a topless bar,
despite rival girls trying to bring her down?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.534
She's not living in Showgirls.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.037
My go-to worst-case scenario.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.462
Trick, there's got to be
some kind of cure.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.165
Well, if she has relations with
anyone, she could get healed.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.000
Oh, come on, random banging.

21:02.095 --> 21:07.180
Or the dunking could wear off.
Fae are less susceptible than humans.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.053
My stomach hurts.

21:09.144 --> 21:13.888
But to be safe, we need her to drink
the water from the river Mnemosyne.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.315
--[KENZ|] Okay.
--|t's very rare and costs a fortune.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.519
Well, what are we supposed
to do? Hold a telethon?

21:20.613 --> 21:25.232
Trick, we have to do something
now, okay? Bo is out there.

21:25.326 --> 21:31.367
Addoncs often keep a small
stock on hand for emergencies.

21:31.458 --> 21:36.998
Oh. Well, then Brother Douglas better
prepare for the second coming of moi.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.544
Let's go.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.966
This one is beautiful. It's from our
Diamonds are Forever collection,

21:44.053 --> 21:45.589
if that's your style.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.965
I don't know if it is, is it?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.513
Well, you know better than me, kitten.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.559
I'm not sure. How much is it?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.512
No. Mr. Lambert said
money is no object.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.598
Which is just exactly
the kind of groom I like.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.683
--Yeah.
--He seems perfect.

21:59.777 --> 22:03.361
Oh, yeah. He is handsome and generous

22:03.448 --> 22:08.067
and, well, between us girls,
he's unbelievably sexy.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.401
Pardon my French.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.077
Well, that is a good start.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.620
How long have you been together?

22:12.707 --> 22:14.413
I don't know.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.538
Well, practically forever then.
How did you meet?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.620
I don't know that either.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.080
Well, it's the love
between you that matters.

22:22.175 --> 22:25.383
Yeah. I think I really love him.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.257
I really like...

22:28.348 --> 22:30.464
...oh, his jacket.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.014
[BO] You are stunning.

22:40.109 --> 22:43.601
I think we should show
our lovely bride-to-be

22:43.696 --> 22:46.483
another gown from the Empress line.

22:48.368 --> 22:52.407
Kitten, is anyone coming
here to be with you?

22:52.497 --> 22:56.331
You know, family or friends?

22:58.002 --> 23:02.371
There's a girl, she has--
she has pink hair.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.673
No, blue! Or is it black? Oh, no, platinum.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.172
Oh, there's a man. He's--he teaches me.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.551
He's like a--like an uncle,
like a bartending uncle.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.051
Names, numbers--

23:13.142 --> 23:14.177
There's a wolf!

23:14.269 --> 23:20.139
He's a--this beautiful, beautiful,
broken wolfman, he's a--who's a cop!

23:20.233 --> 23:22.815
--A wolf-cop?
--Yes.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.564
Kitten, have you seen a doctor recently?

23:25.655 --> 23:27.941
Oh, no, | feel fine.

23:28.032 --> 23:31.445
| feel better and better, actually.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.708
Okay. I see just the
perfect gown, sweetheart.

23:40.795 --> 23:44.333
Can you grab it? It's right at
the end of the rack. Thank you.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.086
--She--she's lovely, isn't she?
--Yeah.

23:48.177 --> 23:52.716
Desmond, pull up the database. I need
all the Fae in Kingslynn Business Park.

23:52.807 --> 23:54.968
Especially those connected with water.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.927
Mermen, Pogopogo, Addoncs.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.512
Yeah.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.893
I want some answers, Acher.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.478
And I want some questions.

24:08.573 --> 24:11.610
You do understand
how this works, don't you?

24:11.701 --> 24:13.487
Tell me what you want to know.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.693
Why did Petros jump?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.449
Why wouldn't he?
I mean, why wouldn't you?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.202
Surely it's better than walking
around swallowing epochs of pain.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.284
And not killing yourself
starts to look like cowardice

24:22.378 --> 24:25.666
and you're no coward!

24:25.757 --> 24:27.418
Or are you?

24:28.885 --> 24:32.048
Killing yourself is the
greatest form of cowardice.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.379
Not if it's done for honour.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.682
Tell me, Detective,

24:37.769 --> 24:40.351
are you an honourable man?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.318
[KENZI] I guess no sign
of the waterboy, huh?

24:46.402 --> 24:48.233
[TRICK] Not that I can see.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.442
Which one is it?

24:51.532 --> 24:55.992
Mnemosyne water smells like
lilies with an undertone of sewage.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.489
Okay. You work on that.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.038
I'll toss the desk, see if I can
come up with something else.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.001
Oh, I found it.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.003
I found something, too.

25:11.094 --> 25:16.384
An address and something that looks
like a license plate number--C-1-8—5-4-N-8.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.135
Let's get Hale.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.687
Where's the hairdresser?

25:28.778 --> 25:30.109
You're not going to be
ready in time, sweetie.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.687
I can't go through with this.

25:32.782 --> 25:37.947
Look, Ryan, I absolutely believe that
we have strong feelings for each other.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.538
--Yeah.
--But memories are starting

25:39.622 --> 25:42.785
to come back and I'm less certain
that this is what we should be doing.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.660
Don't say that.

25:43.751 --> 25:48.165
There will be loads of other
right times if this is right.

25:48.256 --> 25:51.043
Look, you are handsome
and--and fascinating.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.294
--Stop talking.
--But...

25:52.385 --> 25:56.003
--Stop.
--This is so weird. But...

25:56.097 --> 25:59.385
I kind of had feelings
for the young dress girl.

25:59.475 --> 26:05.391
Which is not exactly the
wedding night that one hopes for.

26:05.481 --> 26:10.066
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.739
I'm sorry, too, Mrs. Lambert.

26:27.879 --> 26:31.463
Hale says the number's a private
plane and it took off for the Falls.

26:31.549 --> 26:34.040
Presumably with our Addonc on it.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.717
Maybe the water has some
sort of control over him.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.092
Or he's jonesing for a wax
museum and some fudge.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.798
Either way, we don't
know if Bo's with him.

26:41.893 --> 26:44.976
Except the plane belongs to Ryan.

26:45.062 --> 26:48.304
Ryan Lambert? I thought
he and Bo were done dating.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.390
So did this sucka.

26:50.485 --> 26:54.774
Hale traced Ryan's credit card there.
Stonemont Creek Inn.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.229
Road trip to the Falls.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.986
Yeah, we better find her
so I can kill her.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.494
[BROTHER DOUGLAS] Mr. Lambert,
I'm at your service.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.038
It's a spiritual crisis, Brother.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.037
There's a woman here
making a very big mistake.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.164
Uh huh. Then we'll correct her.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.370
As my associate no doubt told you,

27:12.465 --> 27:14.706
I'm prepared to make
this worth your while.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.558
She recognizes you.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.056
You dunked her the first time.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.272
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.395
Do it again. This time, make it last.

27:51.629 --> 27:55.292
So, you knew Petros
before he killed himself.

27:55.383 --> 27:56.919
What about Cybelle?

27:57.009 --> 28:01.093
Cybelle? A sad lady, really.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.798
She felt she had no future,
no job, no life.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.053
She was poisoned.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.227
She took pills. It's different.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.227
Kenzi. Called eight times.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.228
What the hell?

28:15.319 --> 28:17.810
Is she the one that broke your heart?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.487
And someone named Trick
has called seven times.

28:20.575 --> 28:23.783
Sounds like a pet name for a prostitute.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.282
Someone you call late at night
when the silence is too much

28:26.372 --> 28:31.162
and the lone wolf needs to
empty his soul into someone.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.038
Temper, Detective.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.879
Why do Kenzi and Trick
bother you so much?

28:36.966 --> 28:41.380
They're clearly not important
to you or you'd answer their calls.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.131
I'm busy working.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.430
Oh, talking to one piddling Underfae.

28:46.517 --> 28:49.805
Are you so self-absorbed that you
haven't a moment for your loved ones?

28:49.896 --> 28:51.887
What if they needed you?

28:51.981 --> 28:55.473
What if they're about to
breathe their last breaths

28:55.568 --> 28:59.311
and you can't see past your
own ass long enough to help them?

28:59.405 --> 29:03.273
Or is that what you do?
So unfeeling, hurting those you love

29:03.367 --> 29:05.779
--every chance you get.
--I don't love anyone!

29:05.870 --> 29:08.031
Then what's the point of living?

29:11.584 --> 29:13.575
You poor, pathetic animal.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.081
You don't know me.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.505
Don't I? I think you're the one
who doesn't know himself.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.423
Why do you exist?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.375
What's the point of you?

29:27.391 --> 29:32.351
["Wedding March" plays]

29:43.616 --> 29:45.402
[RYAN] Hmm.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.670
[KENZI] Concierge said they're
in the Hummingbird Room.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.628
Don't panic, she also said there
was a wedding dress involved.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.837
[TRICK] Oh, no.
[KENZI] Yeah.

30:07.932 --> 30:10.423
I just think they should get a quickie
divorce with their quickie wedding.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.976
Fae don't believe in divorce.
Not for the first thousand years.

30:14.063 --> 30:14.848
[KENZI] What?

30:14.939 --> 30:19.057
What? Like it's so wrong to expect
people to give it a real shot?

30:21.821 --> 30:26.781
Here before the moon
and stars and great gods.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.698
Stop the insanity!

30:29.620 --> 30:30.279
[RYAN] Don't stop.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.069
One million dollars, don't stop.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.201
In the name of clan Fin Arvin,
I declare an objection.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.202
Yes!

30:36.293 --> 30:39.751
You are combined as husband and wife.

30:39.839 --> 30:44.458
--Oh, no, no, no.
--Now kiss and love with great joy.

31:00.985 --> 31:04.352
I present Mrs. Ryan Lambert.

31:10.036 --> 31:13.449
Okay, clan Fin Arvin fail,
there's got to be a loophole.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.995
One thousand years, Trick.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.494
One thousand years of marriage
to an over-sexed, poofy-haired,

31:17.585 --> 31:20.292
seven-year-old boy. Okay?

31:20.379 --> 31:23.746
She doesn't have the ring on yet.
The ring's compulsory.

31:23.841 --> 31:26.378
You get the bride. I'll get the bling. Go!

31:26.469 --> 31:27.549
[TRICK] Go!

31:28.179 --> 31:30.170
[RYAN] Hey! She's mine.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.014
[KENZI yells]

31:31.057 --> 31:33.423
[crashing sound]

31:33.517 --> 31:34.677
I had her first!

31:34.769 --> 31:36.179
Bo, it's me.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.056
Pets can't marry their owners.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.680
Flowers, really.

31:43.903 --> 31:48.772
Bo. It's Trick. Drink this.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.322
It's okay.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.872
It'll make you feel better, love.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.950
[glass shatters]

32:01.045 --> 32:03.377
It'll make this all better.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.508
Bo?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.100
Trick?

32:16.769 --> 32:18.225
[KENZI] Trick!

32:20.147 --> 32:21.102
Give me the ring.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.646
No!

32:31.492 --> 32:32.948
Good one.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.154
Who was the water guy?

32:38.249 --> 32:39.830
Brother Doug. An Addonc.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.373
Total brainwashing.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.701
You thought it would be fun
to get on a plane with Ry-Ry

32:43.796 --> 32:45.627
and marry his creepy self.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.796
But we stopped it
before it became official.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.499
Wow, good day at the office, guys.

32:50.594 --> 32:53.336
You look really beautiful, Bo.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.007
I never really thought I'd pick
this giant, puffy, marshmallow dress.

32:58.102 --> 33:01.469
--Me neither. But it totally works.
--I know, right?

33:03.190 --> 33:06.774
Okay, we need to get some more
fancy fix-up water for groom-bot here.

33:06.861 --> 33:10.854
I just don't get it. I mean,
we don't even like each other.

33:10.948 --> 33:15.942
Although, I, uh, I did call him to heal.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.618
--What?
--Yeah.

33:20.082 --> 33:23.199
Okay, it's all becoming clear.

33:23.294 --> 33:27.253
We're going to need candles,
white cloth, and Kenzi.

33:29.592 --> 33:32.550
[ACHER] If I had everything you
had as a proper Fae, I'd be happy.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.718
l'd enjoy life.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.799
Those of you in the master class moving
amongst humans as though you were men.

33:39.894 --> 33:42.977
lam a man and a wolf.
I live in both worlds.

33:43.063 --> 33:45.054
That's your problem.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.764
You're neither man or wolf.

33:46.859 --> 33:50.272
You think you fit in both worlds,
but you don't fit in either.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.819
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:52.907 --> 33:57.071
Of course I do.
You just can't bear hearing it.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.618
You're a lost soul,
searching for an identity.

33:59.705 --> 34:03.573
Searching for something to hold on to,
but everything you touch turns to dust.

34:03.667 --> 34:08.502
Stop. Stop talking!

34:08.589 --> 34:13.299
You're afloat in a sea of self-doubt
without a life preserver in sight.

34:15.888 --> 34:19.722
You're tired, Dyson.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.801
You're tired and defeated.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.012
Life without love's become unbearable.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.188
Stop it.

34:28.275 --> 34:32.769
Not worth living. Wouldn't you agree?

34:32.863 --> 34:37.778
Save your friends the pain
of betrayal of their love for you.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.531
Go on.

34:41.622 --> 34:47.333
Five pounds of pressure on the trigger
and all your misery will simply go away.

34:48.963 --> 34:52.171
It's time to put it all behind you.

34:52.258 --> 34:57.048
You're a failure as a man
and you're a failure as a wolf.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.972
lam still a wolf.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.817
This is what you did to them, isn't it?

35:13.904 --> 35:15.610
This is how you killed them.

35:15.698 --> 35:18.064
I only held up a mirror and
showed them the ugly truth

35:18.158 --> 35:19.659
just like I'm doing with you.

35:19.743 --> 35:23.327
The only ugly thing here is you.

35:23.414 --> 35:27.908
You're empty and you're alone.

35:28.002 --> 35:32.120
The only joy you get is from
causing misery to a real Fae.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.830
--I am a real Fae.
--[DYSON] No!

35:34.925 --> 35:37.041
You hate yourself.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.843
You prey on the weakness
of your masters.

35:39.930 --> 35:43.093
You think that if you can
rise above them for a moment,

35:43.183 --> 35:51.477
it will mean you're not a sad
and unwanted, pathetic abomination.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.899
I've killed dozens of you with
little more than my intellect.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.601
You're not better than me.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.732
I don't think I am.

36:05.706 --> 36:08.869
But I do think I just got a confession.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.335
[ACHER] You didn't win, Detective.

36:13.422 --> 36:16.414
You've only prolonged the inevitable.

36:16.508 --> 36:20.217
When you take your life,
the victory will be mine.

36:20.304 --> 36:24.923
Detective! I'm still in your mind!

36:30.564 --> 36:32.930
--[TR|CK] Make a tiny incision on his wrist.
--[KENZI] Just a tiny one?

36:33.025 --> 36:34.686
[TRICK] Tiny.

36:34.777 --> 36:37.439
[KENZI] I don't know why I'm
the right person for the job here.

36:37.529 --> 36:41.693
[TRICK] It doesn't matter why. Just be
careful, you might feel a little faint.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.900
[KENZI] Fainting is for wimps.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.451
[TRICK] Now...

36:46.538 --> 36:47.869
...with harm to none, thy will be done.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.492
[KENZI] With harm to
none, thy will be done.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.995
[TRICK] The wrist I cleave
and the other leave.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.044
[TRICK] Thou cannot harm him, Bo.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.087
Thou cannot harm him, Bo.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.086
--Wait, what did I do?
--Shh.

37:00.177 --> 37:02.543
Head rush. Head rush.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.094
[BO] Here she goes.

37:04.181 --> 37:07.719
[RYAN gasping]

37:07.810 --> 37:10.222
I thought I was dreaming,
but you are wearing a white dress.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.813
Actually, it's champagne.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.478
--[RYAN] Ah.
--We almost got married.

37:13.565 --> 37:17.228
I need a whiskey and a beer,
with a side of strippers.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.308
Is she okay?

37:18.404 --> 37:19.894
She'll be fine in a couple of minutes.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.650
For the record, I was
out of my mind, too.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.481
Sure, you were.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.191
What happened to us?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.368
An Addonc. Well, for me, anyway.

37:28.455 --> 37:33.040
Something else happened to you,
which I am dying hear about.

37:33.127 --> 37:34.833
Oh, that's my bad.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.253
I was with this Holdra last night, Sonja.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.956
That's when you called for
your little emergency service call.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.713
Ah, god, she went totally
ballistic and crazy jealous.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.965
She has been known to

37:46.056 --> 37:49.344
melt portions of people's brain to
control her enemies, you know, so...

37:49.435 --> 37:51.266
--That must be it.
--That must be it.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.264
Did I catch the bouquet?

37:53.355 --> 37:54.970
Hey. Here.

38:01.822 --> 38:05.940
Here. Come on.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.286
I'm going to have us flown back and
we'll go kick some Addnonc's ass.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.736
Well, that was exactly
what I was going to do.

38:10.831 --> 38:13.573
One more beating for old times' sake?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.036
Deal.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.915
Deal. Let's go.

38:22.509 --> 38:23.669
[BO] Wow.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.342
[BROTHER DOUGLAS] A generous donor

38:26.430 --> 38:31.299
has enabled our mission to
work in the Turks and Caicos.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.850
So, quickly, we will pack up.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.974
Not so fast, Dougie.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.807
Mr. Lambert. What a pleasure.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.483
I want my money back.

38:41.570 --> 38:45.483
In the words of our Lord, no.

38:45.574 --> 38:49.613
We can, however, provide you
with a baptism for your generosity.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.489
That's a very generous offer.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.286
Breathe it in, folks.

38:53.373 --> 38:57.412
Refreshing taste of Mnemosyne,

38:57.503 --> 38:59.368
the zero-calorie
mind-altering beverage.

38:59.463 --> 39:00.248
Breathe deeply.

39:00.297 --> 39:04.256
No! No! You can't.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.379
Prepare to lose your religion.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.716
He broke the mould
when he made you.

39:16.438 --> 39:20.772
Sit down while I call my friend, the Ash.

39:22.236 --> 39:24.272
Hey, nice work.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.694
You too.

39:25.781 --> 39:28.067
Almost makes me sad
we don't get to do it again.

39:28.158 --> 39:31.992
Well, it had to end eventually.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.569
Oil and water.

39:33.664 --> 39:34.995
Mhm.

39:37.376 --> 39:42.962
Will you, um, will you still wear
that bracelet that I gave you?

39:43.048 --> 39:46.586
Wow, that is strangely
sentimental of you.

39:46.677 --> 39:49.544
It's got a chip in it. It'll warn me
when you're within fifty feet.

39:49.638 --> 39:51.253
Oh.

39:51.348 --> 39:52.929
I'll walk the other way.
I won't be tempted.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.597
Good plan.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.354
Good-bye, Ryan.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.227
Bye, beautiful.

40:55.245 --> 40:59.329
[slurping]

41:06.214 --> 41:07.875
I can't believe you lied
to me about Ryan.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.299
Kenzi, I know. Okay? I'm sorry.

41:11.386 --> 41:15.755
Verbal apology number eighty-four,
if you're keeping track.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.305
You know, if you would
have told me the truth,

41:17.392 --> 41:19.348
then maybe I could
have found you earlier.

41:19.436 --> 41:23.850
I know. I'm sorry, Kenzi.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.774
Verbal apology number eighty-five,
for the folks at home.

41:31.198 --> 41:34.816
You really shouldn't fib to
people who are close to you.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.825
Especially when you expect
them to be your Maid of Honour,

41:40.916 --> 41:43.578
--when it's for reals, you know?
--Yeah.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.913
Back in two shakes.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.512
How's your beer? Is it cold enough?

41:57.599 --> 41:59.635
Been having a little bit
of trouble with the taps.

41:59.726 --> 42:02.593
Did you hear what Kenzi just said,

42:02.688 --> 42:05.771
about lying to the people
that are closest to us?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.768
I heard.

42:07.859 --> 42:13.320
I don't think that Ryan's girlfriend
melted his prefrontal cortex.

42:13.407 --> 42:16.114
I think that I bled on him.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.613
Happens. You've bled on people before.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.867
Yeah, but this is the first time
that one of them went all gaga

42:21.957 --> 42:24.289
and started stalking me.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.412
Something was different.

42:26.503 --> 42:32.999
He was acting like... like one of Aife's...
my mom's Chippendale boy-toys.

42:33.093 --> 42:35.084
Perish the thought.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.840
I just thought that
you might know more,

42:37.931 --> 42:41.515
as a man who can control
destiny with his blood

42:41.601 --> 42:45.719
and who knew right away
how to bring Ryan back.

42:47.441 --> 42:51.150
Are you asking me something?

42:51.236 --> 42:52.942
Not yet.

42:54.614 --> 42:58.357
We have to focus on the battle ahead.

42:58.452 --> 43:03.446
But when I ask you
the questions that I have,

43:03.540 --> 43:07.704
I am going to want answers.

43:07.794 --> 43:13.630
Real honest answers.

43:15.761 --> 43:20.300
Message received, loud and clear.
