00:13.430 --> 00:14.556
that's not your fault,

it was my fear of going back,

00:23.940 --> 00:26.401

I digitize documents
for the Maritime Museum,

I've been given access to the archives.

"August 15th, set sail
from Port-au-Prince on calm seas."

19:58.739 --> 20:02.492
"Came upon the Spanish ship San Jose
on fire."

20:02.576 --> 20:04.244
"The entire deck was aflame."

20:04.328 --> 20:06.955
"And we could hear the screams
of men trapped below."

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
"The Spanish captain cared
about only one thing,

20:09.917 --> 20:13.337
his valuable cargo,
the Cross of Santo Domingo

20:14.421 --> 20:15.923
and countless bars of gold."

20:16.006 --> 20:18.008
"Once the cargo was on board,
we went to help the crew,

20:18.091 --> 20:20.552
but Captain Limbrey ordered us
to pull bayonets

20:20.636 --> 20:23.138
and not to let
any of the Spanish crew on board."

20:24.598 --> 20:25.849
"He robbed them

20:26.808 --> 20:28.143
and left them to die."

20:30.395 --> 20:35.108
-So it didn't go down off Bermuda.
-And it was a Limbrey stealing shit again.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.027
This diary proves that both the gold

20:37.110 --> 20:39.571
and the Cross of Santo Domingo
were on the Royal Merchant.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.365
[JJ] Why didn't we find it
in the well then?

20:42.157 --> 20:47.287
I mean, if Denmark was able
to get this, like, bedazzled cross

20:47.371 --> 20:51.833
off of the Merchant to shore,
why didn't he just hide it with the gold?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.835
-Because it was too big.
-[Pope] You're right.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.297
He had to hide it someplace else.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.298
[Kie] But where?

20:59.174 --> 21:00.634
[Pope] Right before he was hung,

21:00.717 --> 21:04.137
Denmark said he'd buried the treasure
at the foot of the angel.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.891
-[JJ] I thought this was about the key.
-[Kie] Right. So what's the connection?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.394
"The path to the tomb begins
in the island room."

21:10.477 --> 21:12.604

21:22.364 --> 21:24.574
If we just sit here
and try to figure this out,

21:24.658 --> 21:26.285
we're gonna get nowhere.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.580
But if we get creative
and go to this bonfire tonight,

21:31.164 --> 21:32.249
maybe we get somewhere.

and sort of being a fugitive,
it felt good to be back. [chuckles]

22:14.791 --> 22:18.378
[Pope] Look, I'm just saying that
if you talk to your parents, you know,

22:18.462 --> 22:23.175
and, like, actually let them talk,
and listen, maybe they'd let you back.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.053
Okay, I feel like you're not listening
to me. You sound like my dad.

blew up right in front of her.
