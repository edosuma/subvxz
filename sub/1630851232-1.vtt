21:01.869 --> 21:04.437
You need strength to
toss the canister like that,

21:04.480 --> 21:08.310
and anger.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.400
Now imagine what I could tell
you if you got me out of here.

21:11.444 --> 21:15.448
[tense music]

21:15.491 --> 21:17.798
- Brandon Dover,
28-year-old male

21:17.841 --> 21:20.235
with extreme abdominal pain,
low BP and heart arrhythmia.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.846
- I just released him. Brandon,
Brandon, can you hear me?

21:22.890 --> 21:24.021
Did you take the meds
we gave you?

21:24.065 --> 21:25.893
- [groans]
Yeah. It hurts.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
- I need a surgical consult.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.766
Trauma One.
- [groans in pain]

21:30.724 --> 21:32.987
- We got a bleeder!

21:33.030 --> 21:34.162
- Got it, suture.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.167
Scissors.

21:39.210 --> 21:43.084
- Appendix, liver, spleen,
arteries, they all look fine.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.610
- Hmm.
They're rock hard.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.612
- Ischemic loop of bowel?

21:49.656 --> 21:51.788
- No sign of thrombus
or infection.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.313
- Well, he came in for gout,
we gave him medication.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
- It didn't help.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.621
- But what if the pharmacy
screwed up his meds?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.275
- Maybe he didn't have gout.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.582
- I saw the crystals myself.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.931
Okay, well,
what if he did take his meds

22:03.974 --> 22:05.802
but maybe
he took too many?

22:05.846 --> 22:07.804
- Why would he OD
on Colchicine?

22:07.848 --> 22:10.981
[indistinct chatter]

22:11.939 --> 22:14.289
[heart monitor beeping]

22:18.206 --> 22:20.164
- Lyn, can we talk?

22:20.208 --> 22:21.470
- Professionally?

22:21.514 --> 22:24.168
- Personally.
[loud hissing]

22:24.212 --> 22:26.170
- [screams]

22:31.001 --> 22:31.350
.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.482
- So what're you gonna do?

22:33.526 --> 22:35.963
Give up on your practice,
and your patients,

22:36.006 --> 22:37.399
and everything that you've

22:37.443 --> 22:39.270
built here and go back,
and what?

22:39.314 --> 22:41.142
- Maybe you should leave.
- No, I won't.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.057
- You won't?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.798
- You won't know how long
I've waited to be right here?

22:44.841 --> 22:47.322
Now that I'm here, I'm not just
gonna leave, just talk to me!

22:47.366 --> 22:49.280
Let me try,
please let me fight for this.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.630
- Okay, all right.

22:50.673 --> 22:54.068
The clinic that I took my mom,
they need a new

22:54.111 --> 22:56.810
medical director and--

22:56.853 --> 22:58.812
and they want me.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.251
- That's great.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.861
I'll go back and forth
every other weekend.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.515
It's what, a six hour flight,
why not?

23:06.559 --> 23:08.996
You can do the same,
we'll be frequent flyers.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.476
- We can't have
a long-distance relationship

23:10.519 --> 23:12.565
without ever having had
a short-distance one.

23:12.608 --> 23:13.827
- Listen--listen to me.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.089
Why not?

23:15.132 --> 23:17.265
Why not?

23:17.308 --> 23:19.398
I'm here.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.923
Now that I've held you
and I've kissed you

23:22.966 --> 23:25.229
and I've humiliated myself

23:25.273 --> 23:26.709
in front of the entire
neighborhood.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.146
- How have you
humiliated yourself?

23:29.190 --> 23:30.583
- Hey, New York!

23:30.626 --> 23:34.282
I love this woman
and now she's trying to dump--

23:34.325 --> 23:35.414
No, I'm not gonna--

23:35.457 --> 23:37.285
I'll keep going,
I swear to God

23:37.328 --> 23:38.242
I will keep going--
- No, shh.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.461
- Please,
Max, stop.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.245
- I'm not gonna stop
until you tell me

23:41.289 --> 23:42.856
that we're gonna try.
- How?

23:42.899 --> 23:45.206
- I--London, New York,
back and forth,

23:45.249 --> 23:46.381
Tunisia, I don't care.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.123
Anywhere,
as long as we're together.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.473
Please.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.953
- What about Luna?

23:55.259 --> 23:57.131
- She can come with me.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.002
She's young enough,
it's fine.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.177
It'll be an adventure for her,

24:00.221 --> 24:01.570
it'll be
an adventure for all of us.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.050
I just want you to say
that you're willing

24:03.093 --> 24:05.574
to fight for this.

24:05.618 --> 24:09.665
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna run

24:09.709 --> 24:12.233
through these
streets butt naked.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.713
I'll do it.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.758
Literally, I'm taking
my pants off right now.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.325
Here they go.
- No, okay!

24:17.368 --> 24:19.458
- Completely--
- I love you.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.551
I love you.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.083
- Do everything you can
to secure the hospital.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.432
Police, FBI, call it all in.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.739
- Max. Max!
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.741
I--
- We're here to help.

24:41.784 --> 24:45.571
- All O2 tanks and all
other flammable gases

24:45.614 --> 24:47.660
need to get disconnected
and someone's gotta go around

24:47.703 --> 24:49.313
and ensure that all
your fire doors are latching.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.881
- I hate to ask, but--

24:51.925 --> 24:54.667
- You don't have to.
- Thank you.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.538
Tell me you got something?

24:56.582 --> 24:59.062
- Um, well, Miss Wheeler's
not exactly compliant.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.586
- Iggy, if we don't find this
person someone's going to die.

25:00.629 --> 25:01.717
Now get back in there
and do whatever you can.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.240
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.285
How you guys holding up?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.504
- No signs of concussion.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.418
Just a few scrapes and bruises.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.898
- Lauren,
I hate to do this,

25:08.942 --> 25:10.378
but you need to put
the ED on diversion.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.901
- On it.
- Claude, let's go over

25:11.945 --> 25:13.686
your schedule, see what
surgeries we can push.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.775
- Sure, I'll be right back,
okay?

25:26.655 --> 25:28.614
- If you hadn't been there...

25:31.355 --> 25:33.836
- I just wanted to apologize.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.582
- It's passed, Floyd.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.933
- No, no, it hasn't.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.196
I thought we could
go back to being friends.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.503
But whenever I'm
with your husband,

25:48.547 --> 25:50.984
all I do is think about you.

25:51.027 --> 25:54.378
And when we're together,
I just keep thinking about him.

25:57.686 --> 26:01.298
- You don't think
this has been hard on me?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.692
He may like you
more than I do.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.396
- Something's gotta give, Lyn.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.877
Look, either I step down, or...

26:22.232 --> 26:24.887
- Or what?

26:32.852 --> 26:35.811
- Okay, I need every patient
transferred or discharged.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.944
And why isn't Brandon Dover

26:37.987 --> 26:40.337
on anti-colchicine
fab fragments yet?

26:40.381 --> 26:42.383
- He is, I just haven't
had time to update his file.

26:42.426 --> 26:45.473
How'd he mess up
his meds so bad?

26:45.516 --> 26:46.909
- I have no idea,

26:46.953 --> 26:51.131
considering we gave him such
explicit instructions.

26:51.174 --> 26:53.437
- Dr. Bloom?

26:54.917 --> 26:56.745
- Hey.

26:59.095 --> 27:03.056
- I'll just go
update that file.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.188
- Just go.

27:06.973 --> 27:10.019
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.892
How's your first day goin'?
- Are you serious?

27:12.935 --> 27:14.502
It's bad enough
you gave me a medal

27:14.545 --> 27:15.808
for cleaning out a wound,

27:15.851 --> 27:17.897
but why'd you tell
everyone we were a couple?

27:17.940 --> 27:19.550
- Yeah, okay--

27:19.594 --> 27:22.162
- We agreed to wait until they
got to know me as a resident.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.859
You were going to treat me
like everyone else.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.687
- But you're not
like everybody else.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.689
You're a fully trained doctor.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.605
They're just a bunch of kids
pretending to be doctors.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.302
I would have
complimented them too,

27:32.346 --> 27:34.261
had the situation
been reversed.

27:34.304 --> 27:36.655
- But the situation can never
be reversed because the other

27:36.698 --> 27:38.657
residents aren't
sleeping with their boss.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.312
- Okay, okay.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.010
I'm sorry.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.533
Okay, I'm sorry.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.406
I just--I was just trying
to work my program, you know?

27:49.450 --> 27:51.757
Put it all out there.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.760
There's this saying,
it's you're only as sick

27:54.803 --> 27:56.892
as your secrets, and...

28:02.463 --> 28:04.552
- Lauren?

28:04.595 --> 28:06.206
- You know what,
you were right.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.991
You were totally in the right,
and I am wrong.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.819
But I think I know what's
going on with my patient.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.695
[water dripping]

28:20.742 --> 28:24.050
- Must have
been zero visibility.

28:24.093 --> 28:29.882
Everywhere you look,
just flames, smoke.

28:29.925 --> 28:33.755
Black and orange,
orange and black.

28:38.673 --> 28:42.111
Ah, the doctor disapproves.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.462
- No, I'm concerned.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.508
- No.

28:47.551 --> 28:50.163
You're scared of me.

28:50.206 --> 28:53.557
You have been since
you walked into my ward.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.777
-The only thing
I'm scared of, Mary,

28:55.821 --> 28:57.910
is the damage
being done to your psyche.

29:01.652 --> 29:05.395
- You treat murderers, rapists.

29:05.439 --> 29:08.094
You're alone in rooms
with people who could snap you

29:08.137 --> 29:10.226
like a twig, and I don't
think you break a sweat.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.925
And here you are acting like
the nice woman of a certain age

29:12.968 --> 29:16.015
is going to take
a bite out of you.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.495
Which one of us
do you think is having

29:18.539 --> 29:20.323
a damaging
psychological experience?

29:22.064 --> 29:24.110
- You know, Mary, patients
try to drag their doctors

29:24.153 --> 29:26.373
into their pathologies
all the time.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.810
When I practiced, there
was a weekly occurrence.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.638
But, I hate to break it to you,
it's not gonna work.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.075
- You said when you practiced.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.208
Why'd you stop?

29:40.082 --> 29:41.605
I have an eye for sore spots.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.173
Think I'd make a good shrink?

29:44.217 --> 29:45.784
- We're done here.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.873
- Tell me why you quit and I'll
tell you who set the fire.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.839
- I needed a change.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.972
The hours were terrible,
they were killing me.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.062
- I'm giving you a choice

30:03.105 --> 30:06.065
between being honest
with yourself

30:06.108 --> 30:07.893
and watching this place burn.

30:07.936 --> 30:08.981
- Why are you
making this about me?

30:09.024 --> 30:10.330
- "She's not too far gone!

30:10.373 --> 30:13.768
We can help this woman,
we can save her!"

30:13.812 --> 30:17.076
You said that at my trial.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.034
- Mm-hmm.
- You yelled at the judge.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.210
You demanded he
put me in your ward,

30:21.254 --> 30:23.865
not prison,
because you could save me.

30:23.909 --> 30:28.130
Iggy, the White Knight,
knew everyone can be saved.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.219
Now you've quit.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.571
Now you've left
everyone to rot.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.095
Why?

30:36.138 --> 30:41.317
When does the White Knight
stop trying to save everybody?

30:43.319 --> 30:47.323
When he stops believing
that people can be saved.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.285
- Out of here.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.373
Now.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.723
- Fire isn't rage, Dr. Frome.

30:55.766 --> 30:56.985
Want to know what it is?

30:57.029 --> 31:00.293
God writes in pencil,
fire's his eraser.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.558
It's not for anger,
it's for pain.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.864
- That's your profile?

31:05.907 --> 31:08.127
The arsonist is in pain?

31:08.170 --> 31:09.737
- Just like you.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.173
Just like me.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.657
- Okay.
Thank you, Teresa.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.485
I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.704
- Hey, so, it was a mistake
to bring Mary back into this.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.097
It definitely set her back.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.490
Now the best I got out
of her is that

31:23.533 --> 31:25.405
the arsonist is
trying to erase something.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.710
- Erase what?

31:26.754 --> 31:28.408
- I don't know,
I have no idea.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.671
Is there anything that connects
the location of the two fires?

31:30.714 --> 31:31.977
Anything?
- Not really.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.500
I mean, one was
a COVID overflow unit

31:33.543 --> 31:36.111
and the other was an auxiliary
space for neurology.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.591
- And what was
it used for last?

31:37.634 --> 31:39.375
[sighs]

31:39.419 --> 31:41.377
- It was our
second COVID overflow unit.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.336
- Where else did we
annex for COVID patients?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.035
Max!

31:47.079 --> 31:48.732
Max!

31:50.125 --> 31:51.910
