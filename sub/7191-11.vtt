Well, if I bring you Mia,
you're not--

18:51.547 --> 18:52.130
you're not
gonna hurt her, right?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.049
- No, of course not.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.384
- Oh, okay.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.052
I mean, I was still
gonna tie her up real good

18:57.135 --> 18:58.679
and then probably chop
those bangs off,

18:58.762 --> 19:00.389
but if we're gonna go
any further than that--

19:00.472 --> 19:02.683
- No, just going to
question her.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.726
- Oh, okay, then.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.311
Oh, any luck with the crystal

19:06.395 --> 19:07.729
and figuring out
how to get it off Emma...

19:07.813 --> 19:09.731
and Maddie?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.568
- No. You?

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
- Me?

19:14.862 --> 19:18.574
- Oh, don't even try it.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.409
I know full well that you

19:20.492 --> 19:22.578
and that pesky Novoa wizard

19:22.661 --> 19:23.829
are looking for
the last piece of the crystal.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.247
- Well, how did you know?

19:25.330 --> 19:30.878
- Because he is the noisiest
spell-caster ever.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.338
- Try spying with him.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.716
He can't even sneak up on anyone
without making a ruckus.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.176
- Well, as long as
I already know,

19:38.260 --> 19:39.303
you might as well
tell me the truth.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.929
- Well,
we haven't found anything,

19:41.013 --> 19:43.891
but I'm not done looking.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.184
Ah!
And checkmate.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.477
I rule.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.064
- Mia?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.318
- In here.
What do you want?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.906
- You were right,
Maddie's not my friend.

19:58.989 --> 19:59.281
I'm in.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.787
[door shuts]

20:05.871 --> 20:08.248
ANDI: Breaking and entering,
easy as pie.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.341
It took you 20 minutes.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.426
You could've just
teletransported in with me.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.678
- Yeah, but my way
is more fun.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.138
Now, back to the wall.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.015
- I am not sticking my hand
back in there.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.225
And forget about me
re-ferreting myself.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.560
There are mouse traps
in there.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.896
- Oh, you scare so easily.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.023
You know what, okay, forget
about re-ferreting yourself.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.399
I have a better idea.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.360
Get rid of the wall
so we can see inside.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.486
- Yeah, but how am I gonna--

20:37.569 --> 20:39.363
- Make the wall invisible.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.448
- Ah, great idea.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.824
- I know, right?

20:42.908 --> 20:45.494
- But I haven't done a spell
like that before.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.829
- And you call yourself
a rebel wizard?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.331
- I can do it.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.250
- You know what,
don't worry about it, okay?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.834
Once we get the crystal,

20:52.918 --> 20:54.127
Emma can reverse it
if you can't.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.339
She is stronger.
- She is not.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.968
- Then this should be
no problem for you.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.845
- This wall we need to get by,
make it invisible to the eye.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.515
- Actually, I think
the wall should--

21:06.598 --> 21:08.225
- Andi?

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
ANDI: I'm right here.
- Where?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.520
[smacks]
Ah!

21:11.603 --> 21:13.689
ANDI: Right here.
What are you, blind?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.108
- No, but--
But you're invisible.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.902
ANDI: I am?
I am!

21:18.986 --> 21:20.195
- Well, not for long.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.363
Stand by the door
so that I can

21:21.446 --> 21:24.116
make you visible again.
ANDI: No way!

21:24.199 --> 21:25.701
This is my chance
to catch Mia by surprise.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.869
[door opens]
- What? No! Andi, wait!
