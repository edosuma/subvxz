WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.588
How did we get here?

00:05.672 --> 00:09.218
It's a question as old
as man's capacity to ask it.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.599
Were we made?

00:19.144 --> 00:22.314
Or were we actually the makers?

00:25.692 --> 00:30.572
Certainly, we're creators.
Innovators. Explorers.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.991
One small step for man…

00:33.075 --> 00:38.413
Not beholden to our past,
but in total control of our future.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.505
So maybe the question isn't,
"How did we get here?"

00:47.714 --> 00:51.343
But maybe the question is,
"How far can we actually go?"

00:51.426 --> 00:53.303
Goddamn, man!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.681
There is so much space in here.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.349
Why do you keep coming to my side?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.018
Sorry, I'm just--
I'm in a state of creation,

01:00.102 --> 01:02.896
-and it's really exciting.
-Right, but so am I.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.859
I'm working on the build.
It's gonna be huge!

01:06.942 --> 01:08.777
Great. Yes! Okay. We're both thinking big.

01:08.861 --> 01:09.945
This is awesome.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.030
Well, you're thinking big. I'm doing big.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.575
I'm "bigging" as we speak,
so could you stop bothering me?

01:14.658 --> 01:17.619
Yeah, totally.
Real quick, is my hair okay?

01:17.703 --> 01:19.538
Sometimes when I wear the rig,
it messes up my hair.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.498
-It looks fine… Yeah.
-It does? Okay, thanks.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.418
I was thinking that maybe you could
throw a wash through yours,

01:24.501 --> 01:27.546
because it was looking a little greasy.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.592
-Do you need something from me right now?
-I had this idea

01:31.675 --> 01:34.803
that I wanted to run by you that's,
like, super huge.

01:35.679 --> 01:39.725
I was thinking, maybe we could
take Hera and put her into the metaverse.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.684
-No.
-Wait, listen.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.478
All we have to do is link everything
to the blockchain,

01:43.562 --> 01:45.647
and then, yes,
we will have to convert all of our assets

01:45.731 --> 01:47.900
-into Ethereum, possible--
-Ian. Ian!

01:47.983 --> 01:50.986
-Okay, look, you are great.
-I am?

01:51.069 --> 01:53.614
-Uh-huh. But you've done it.
-I have?

01:53.697 --> 01:54.698
Yeah.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.992
Yeah, you came up with some great ideas.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
And now, I'm implementing them.

01:58.911 --> 02:02.873
So maybe you could just
slow down the flow.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.460
I don't know if
that's such a great idea, Pop,

02:06.543 --> 02:08.586
'cause I'm kinda tapped
into the source right now,

02:08.669 --> 02:11.798
and if I deny the flow entry
into the material world, it could have--

02:11.882 --> 02:15.469
Dire consequences, I know.
You've said that many times.

02:16.094 --> 02:21.099
But, for now, could you take that risk?
For me?

02:21.183 --> 02:22.935
For you? Yeah.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.020
-I wanna be a good partner.
-You are.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.438
You are. You're a great partner.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.398
And you know what would be
the best partnering

02:28.482 --> 02:29.733
that you could do right now?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.569
Go and get me lunch.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.364
-You want me to get you lunch?
-Uh-huh.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.824
Go get me a buffalo chicken pizza
from the gas station on the corner.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.701
None of those words make sense together.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.080
I know, but it's what I want.
And you wanna help me, right? So…

02:43.163 --> 02:46.291
-Yeah. Okay.
-Get in there.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.293
Yeah, I will. I'll do that for you.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.046
But wait,
is the buffalo chicken on the pizza?

02:51.129 --> 02:54.716
-I'm so--
-Leave me alone!

02:58.470 --> 02:59.680
Hey, Pop, did you say something?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.890
'Cause
I thought I heard you say something.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.477
No. Nope. Just getting back to work.

03:06.228 --> 03:10.232
Okay. Again, you might wanna just
throw a wash through that hair.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.499
Look at that snake slither.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.668
-What's he doing?
-Picking up the trash.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.795
Probably to sort through
for company secrets.

03:32.588 --> 03:37.342
He's emptying the trash into the cart,
and he put it down.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.138
Okay. So, he emptied the trash?
You mean, he did his job?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.308
Carol, that is what he wants you to think.
Brad is always three steps ahead.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.767
Well, I'm trying to be steps ahead too.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.604
Can I call him Head
of the Equitable Cleaning Initiative?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.063
Till I figure out what his angle is,

03:50.147 --> 03:52.065
the only thing we're calling
that man is sus,

03:52.149 --> 03:53.609
'cause that's what he is. He is so sus.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.527
Jesus.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.112
-What are you doing there?
-Reporting back.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.531
You told me to follow Brad
and report any unusual activity.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.076
Well, guess what he planted
in the bathroom? This.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.205
What is that? Listening device?

04:06.288 --> 04:08.290
No, it's a diffuser.
But guess what's in it?

04:08.373 --> 04:09.291
Poison?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.919
Vanilla oil. But with, like,
an actual vanilla bean in the bottle.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.129
I looked it up online.
It retails for, like, 68 bucks.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.589
-Is that all?
-Sixty-eight's a lot for a diffuser.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.301
No, I mean, is that all you found?
Is there anything else weird?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.678
Yes! The toilet paper was folded
into a little point,

04:21.762 --> 04:22.763
like at a fancy hotel.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.474
And all the toilets
were absolutely spotless.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.852
Really?
What the hell could he be plotting?

04:28.936 --> 04:32.272
The only thing he is plotting,
David, is clean bathrooms.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.233
I'm sorry, Carol,
but you are not gonna convince me

04:34.316 --> 04:36.026
that Brad Bakshi is not up to something.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.402
He's putting toilet paper in points.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.821
He's buying diffusers out of
his own pocket for I don't know how much.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.031
-What? $68.
-Sixty-eight.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.157
-Plus tax.
-Plus tax.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.035
And the tax in California is insane.
In this liberal hellscape--

04:45.118 --> 04:46.620
Okay, Jo, listen. I just--

04:46.703 --> 04:48.956
Look, I need you to figure out
what Brad is planning,

04:49.039 --> 04:50.457
so really get into his head.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.878
I know that might be tricky for you,
but could you do it for me?

04:58.590 --> 04:59.716
On it.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.142
-Poppy!
-Christ, Dana!

05:50.642 --> 05:52.561
I nearly bit my tongue off. Jesus!

05:52.644 --> 05:55.606
I tried waiting for you to turn your head,
but it's been, like, 20 minutes.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.565
What do you want?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.650
I'm supposed to
start working for you today.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.819
Shit. Was that this Friday?
I thought it was next Friday.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.029
It's Tuesday.

06:02.112 --> 06:06.617
Right. Whatever. I don't really
do calendars or something.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.078
Look, I've just--
I don't have anything for you today.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.038
I'm too busy.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.497
Well, I can help you with your work.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.749
Yeah?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.751
Hey, I mean, if you wanna hang around

06:15.834 --> 06:18.003
and just shove Skittles in my mouth,
be my guest.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.087
But this was the plan.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.465
I'd go to school for a year,
and then I'd come back here.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.509
Look, I'm just so deep
in the shit right now

06:23.592 --> 06:25.302
that it will take me longer
to catch you up

06:25.385 --> 06:26.845
than it will to just finish it myself.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.973
So, how about this?
Take your first day off.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.894
Have a great weekend!

06:35.562 --> 06:37.022
It's Tuesday!

06:48.784 --> 06:49.868
Hey, Pop.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.248
Can everyone stop sneaking up on me?

06:55.541 --> 06:58.252
Who's everyone? I've been standing here
alone for the last 20 minutes.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.336
I wanted to give you space,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.380
but you lose all track
of time when you work.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.091
-Where's my lunch?
-Yeah, there.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.843
What's that?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.303
That's a smoothie station
and an exercise bike.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.430
-No.
-Just go with me here, Pop.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.809
I've got a plan to completely shift
your nutritional paradigm.

07:13.892 --> 07:17.771
Now, using a combination
of whey protein and interval training,

07:17.855 --> 07:19.565
-we're gonna decentralize your core.
-Ian!

07:20.482 --> 07:25.571
Buffalo chicken pizza.
Is it really that difficult?

07:25.654 --> 07:26.989
It is for me.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.283
Come on, Pop. I'm a big thinker.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.828
I don't really see in slices.
I see the whole pie.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.580
A whole pie? I could take a whole pie.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.623
-No, you're not eating a whole pie!
-I could!

07:36.707 --> 07:38.542
I know you could, but you shouldn't.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.962
Look, I promise that I can help you.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.840
I can help GrimPop,
but you gotta let me do my thing.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.592
You gotta let me think big.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.596
Big thinker, huh? You know what?

07:51.221 --> 07:54.391
I wanna show you something. Follow me.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.436
Behold! History's biggest thinkers.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.148
Visionaries, just like you,
who overpromised and under-delivered.

08:01.231 --> 08:05.152
At best, you got P.T. Barnum,
who was just selling a bit of fun.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.946
And then at worst, we've got Jim Jones,

08:08.030 --> 08:10.699
who convinced hundreds
of people to drink poison Kool-Aid.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.577
Wait a second.
What is this? Thomas Edison?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.164
You put Thomas Edison on the same wall
as carnies and cult leaders?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.499
Yes, because Thomas Edison was a liar

08:19.583 --> 08:22.252
and a bully who routinely stole ideas
from other people,

08:22.336 --> 08:26.673
like Joseph Swan, the brilliant engineer
who actually invented the carbon filament.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.051
-What's your point?
-My job is more important than yours.

08:30.302 --> 08:34.056
Oh, really? Really?
Well, two can play at this game.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.183
What about this guy?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.687
Nikola Tesla,
an exceptionally brilliant engineer

08:40.770 --> 08:43.857
who died penniless
because he didn't know how to inspire,

08:43.941 --> 08:46.985
how to tell a story, how to sell the thing
that he was actually making.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.153
Like Edison.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.572
Who was always a week away
from bankruptcy and fraud.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.743
Okay, look, this is what happens
when you work to change things.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.329
First they think you're crazy,
then they fight you,

08:57.412 --> 08:59.456
and all of a sudden, you change the world.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.210
Wow. Wow, that is so wise.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.173
Look, this is what happens
when you work to change things.

09:08.257 --> 09:11.301
And first they think you're crazy,
then they fight you,

09:11.385 --> 09:13.470
and then all of a sudden,
you change the world.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.351
Elizabeth Holmes.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.813
Yeah, that's tough.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.981
Yeah, I bet.

09:24.064 --> 09:29.403
Okay. Well, I guess we're gonna have
to figure this out because, otherwise,

09:29.486 --> 09:32.447
I'm gonna wind up in jail
and you're gonna die in poverty.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.827
-Yeah, I don't wanna die in poverty.
-I don't wanna go to jail.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.996
-Let's figure this out. Let's--
-Yeah. Yes.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.622
-We can--
-Just give me another shot.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.457
-Okay.
-'Cause this is, like, a new thing for me,

09:42.541 --> 09:43.750
and I wanna be a good partner.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.419
Here's what we're gonna do.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.046
Just go upstairs to the MQ kitchen,

09:48.130 --> 09:49.882
and get me sandwiches from the freezer.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.343
Great. All right,
I'm seeing sandwiches in the freezer.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.053
-That's so you.
-I'll get them for you, and--

09:55.137 --> 09:56.930
And I'll eat them and build it!

09:57.014 --> 09:58.891
-Great. Okay. All right. Okay, good.
-Okay.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.986
-You're in LA again?
-Yes, Mom. I'm visiting Dana.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.614
Well, what about school?
Are you ever in school?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.825
Yes. I'm gonna drive back
when I'm done hanging out with her.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.410
Okay, is something wrong?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.662
Why are you there so much
and not at school?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.998
You know what?
This is none of your business, Mom. Okay?

10:23.081 --> 10:26.126
Well, actually, it is my business,
and your father is very concerned.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.629
-Honey, what is wrong?
-Dad, why-- You can't just…

10:28.712 --> 10:31.006
-Why aren't you at school?
-…get on the phone without telling--

10:31.089 --> 10:32.549
-Is everything okay with you?
-I need to go.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.928
-Hi.
-Hi. Sorry.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.430
-I know you have to get back to school.
-It's all good.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.516
It's just nice to see you one more time.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.226
So, I was thinking that we--

10:52.694 --> 10:53.529
You okay?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.322
I'm sorry.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.448
No, it's okay.

10:56.532 --> 10:59.409
Poppy sucks. She sucks.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.371
But I'm contractually tied to her,
and I don't know what I'm gonna do.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.831
-I'm so sorry, babe.
-I'm trapped.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.501
I totally get it.
I had to work with those wackos too.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.505
Look, let's turn this around
'cause this is--

11:11.588 --> 11:12.965
this is stupid, okay?

11:13.841 --> 11:16.343
Let's do something fun. I have an idea.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.344
What?

11:17.427 --> 11:20.138
Well, the other night when we were in MQ,

11:21.139 --> 11:24.518
I saw our old testing cube,
and it reminded me--

11:24.601 --> 11:26.812
-How much fun we had in there?
-Yeah.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.188
Yeah?

11:28.272 --> 11:31.650
So, I was thinking
that maybe we could sneak up there…

11:31.733 --> 11:33.277
Play some games?

11:33.777 --> 11:35.445
-No.
-Look for bugs?

11:35.529 --> 11:39.283
No, like-- have sex. On the couch.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.077
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.370
Okay, let's do it.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.038
-Okay.
-Rachel,

11:45.122 --> 11:47.749
-we're still on the line.
-Oh, my God!

11:47.833 --> 11:49.418
-Oh, God! Oh, my God!
-Your dad is on the phone?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.587
-Your dad is on the phone?
-Why didn't-- Hang up!

12:01.889 --> 12:03.891
Hi. Can we help you?

12:03.974 --> 12:05.017
Sorry. Who are you?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.561
-We're testers.
-We test the game for bugs--

12:07.644 --> 12:09.688
Yeah, yeah. We know what testing is.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.481
Where is the couch?

12:11.565 --> 12:12.941
Oh, yeah, we got rid of that.

12:13.025 --> 12:16.028
We thought it was weird for two people
to share the same seat at work, you know?

12:16.111 --> 12:18.447
-Well, it's not that weird.
-No.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.199
-It's pretty weird.
-It wasn't weird for us.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.368
In fact, it's where we fell in love.
And who knows?

12:23.452 --> 12:25.370
You might too, unless you ain't gay.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.415
Sorry, are you asking us
if we're straight or gay?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.210
-No.
-No.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.545
-I'm super uncomfortable.
-Yeah.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.005
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I--

12:35.756 --> 12:38.258
We didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
That's not who we are.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.385
-Not at all.
-To be clear, we are gay,

12:40.469 --> 12:45.098
and she was saying that maybe you guys
would also be gay together.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.183
But it was a joke.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.392
-It was a joke.
-It was a joke.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.103
I don't think it's funny
to assume someone's sexuality.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.188
Or lack thereof.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.776
-Are y'all fucking with us?
-Are you?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.569
'Cause I feel like
you guys are fucking with us.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.071
No.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.574
This was a mistake.

13:02.658 --> 13:03.825
This was a mistake.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.287
Yeah, we're just gonna go.
See you guys. Have fun testing.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.333
What are your plans?

13:11.416 --> 13:14.711
Well, I was gonna finish these counters
and then hit up the kitchen with a Hoover.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.839
Don't get coy.
I know you're up to something.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.715
And if you are up to something,
I will find out.

13:18.799 --> 13:23.470
You're not gonna find anything, Jo.
I mean, unless you plant it.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.682
But that's not you anymore, is it?

13:30.602 --> 13:31.603
No, it's not.

13:32.354 --> 13:35.524
Me neither.
We're no longer sharks or mice, Jo.

13:35.607 --> 13:39.319
We're just two flawed humans looking
to make an honest start.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.114
-Good.
-Good.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.079
Well, I should get back
to these counters, so…

13:49.162 --> 13:50.622
-Here.
-Okay.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.878
I have to go.

14:01.216 --> 14:04.970
Okay, sandwiches for Poppy.

14:05.053 --> 14:08.891
Sandwiches. Sandwiches. What?

14:10.309 --> 14:13.687
Oh, God, I knew it.
The only sandwiches in here are ice cream.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.148
No.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.360
You know what I'm gonna do?

14:21.153 --> 14:22.154
Yeah.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.948
I'm gonna give her a protein wrap.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.950
She's not gonna like it,
but doesn't matter.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.286
Sometimes that's what
being a good partner is.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.163
It's saying, "No, Poppy. No."

14:31.747 --> 14:33.624
-Hey, Ian.
-Hey, Brad.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.334
Hey, by the way,

14:35.417 --> 14:37.169
great job cleaning our office
the other night.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.921
I live to serve now.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.672
-Yeah, me too.
-Really?

14:40.756 --> 14:42.132
I thought you lived to be a conduit

14:42.216 --> 14:44.885
between the realm of pure potential
and the corporeal plane.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.015
Yes. That's true. Thank you for noticing.

14:50.098 --> 14:54.061
I've always thought of myself that way,
but I never thought anybody else noticed.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.521
I like this new Brad.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.608
But now, what I'm just trying
to do is help Poppy do her thing.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.109
That's gotta be tough.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.362
Trust me. I know what it feels like
to fight against your nature

15:03.445 --> 15:04.988
in order to change.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.240
Not easy.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.242
Yeah, it's not easy.

15:09.993 --> 15:14.414
I feel you, man. I feel you.
Stay strong, brother.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.333
We'll get through this.

15:17.376 --> 15:21.338
Meantime, I really gotta focus
on being a good partner.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.425
She asked me to get her a sandwich,
and that is what I'm going to do.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.720
Speaking of which, I'm headed down
to GrimPop if you want to drop that off.

15:28.804 --> 15:29.805
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.724
-Yeah. That'd be great.
-Easy-peasy.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.726
You can just leave that.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.436
-I'll clean it up, so…
-Okay.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.274
Great.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.778
I guess that frees Ian up.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.115
Frees Ian up for the big ideas.

15:49.408 --> 15:52.995
Let's see what's going on at old MQ.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.664
-You.
-Me?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.291
What do you dream about?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.209
Dogs.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.420
-What?
-Dogs.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.590
Right. No, but-- Sorry.

16:05.257 --> 16:08.677
I mean, like, if you could build anything
in the world, what would it be?

16:08.760 --> 16:09.636
Dog farm.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.264
-A farm for dogs?
-Yeah.

16:13.056 --> 16:16.101
Right. No,
but what are you most passionate about?

16:17.186 --> 16:19.062
Don't say dogs.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.856
Don't say dog.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.482
Cat?

16:23.358 --> 16:24.568
Never mind.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.739
I'm not hiding.

16:29.531 --> 16:30.365
Okay.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.451
Look away.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.414
You're new, aren't you?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.957
Yeah, we just started last week.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.376
Fresh hires.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.589
Powerless, entry-level grunts.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.759
Lowest white men on the totem pole.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.720
I guess so.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.640
I'm sorry.
Totem pole is pretty offensive, isn't it?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.600
Oh, goddamn, you're woke too?

17:01.897 --> 17:03.023
May we help you?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.151
You already have.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.073
Okay, thank you for coming.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.784
I have called this meeting
because there have been reports

17:13.867 --> 17:15.953
of repeated harassment in this office.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.413
From who? Is it you?

17:18.497 --> 17:19.705
It's anonymous, David.

17:19.790 --> 17:23.001
Carol, I'm gonna need to peel off
a small team for a special project.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.796
You can't peel off nobody, okay?
Because you don't work here.

17:25.878 --> 17:30.592
In fact, we have a lot of people
wandering around here

17:30.676 --> 17:32.177
where they don't belong.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.221
We sure do.

17:34.847 --> 17:35.973
Why you looking at me?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.474
I don't know. You tell me, bro.

17:37.558 --> 17:39.852
Carol, I have a question.
What are the testers doing here?

17:39.935 --> 17:42.604
The testers work here,
unlike the two of you!

17:42.688 --> 17:43.689
Who do you think complained?

17:43.772 --> 17:45.983
-What?
-I thought you said it was anonymous.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.527
You are correct, and it is.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.571
You shouldn't have said nothing
when I said something,

17:50.654 --> 17:53.031
and then maybe it wouldn't have
come out like this.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.367
-They complained about us?
-Pussy asses.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.870
-Her too.
-Carol, I wanna work,

17:57.953 --> 18:00.080
-but Poppy won't let me.
-Me neither!

18:00.163 --> 18:01.999
I've got nothing to do, Carol.
And, by the way,

18:02.082 --> 18:03.876
neither do a lot of people up here.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.670
They need big ideas,
not uninspired meetings like this.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.338
We never had meetings
like this when I was here.

18:08.422 --> 18:10.048
We had this exact meeting.

18:10.132 --> 18:13.260
-Carol, if I may--
-You may not.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.386
I'm taking the power back

18:14.469 --> 18:16.889
because y'all are all
cray cray ba-nay-nay.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.057
Ian, what the fuck is this?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.893
-Lord, have mercy.
-Hey, Pop.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.394
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.146
And those frozen sandwiches,

18:24.229 --> 18:25.981
they were melted
so I threw them in the garbage.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.650
They're perfectly good!
I found them in the bottom of Brad's cart!

18:28.734 --> 18:30.652
I tried to shove 'em in the bottom,
but she smelled them.

18:30.736 --> 18:35.407
I knew it. No, you wanted her to find them
to cause dissent and instigate chaos.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.534
-This is all part of your plan.
-I was emptying the trash.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.494
I do all the floors
in the building, David.

18:39.578 --> 18:43.040
"Oh, it's part of my job.
I'm just a simple janitor."

18:43.123 --> 18:46.043
Don't start that with me.
No one buys it, Brad. Okay?

18:46.126 --> 18:48.420
You can't change.
A person like you cannot change.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.963
Do you really believe that?

18:50.047 --> 18:51.673
No, no, Brad's different, Jo.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.759
He's, you know--
He's an evil, deviant person.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.720
-You don't think I'm evil and devious?
-No, I do. I do.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.556
I mean, I don't know.
I'm sorry, I'm getting confused.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.392
-Do you wanna be?
-Carol, Poppy's acting like a cat.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.186
-Make her stop!
-Yeah, I'm acting like a cat!

19:04.269 --> 19:07.481
I'm acting like a lion. You know what?
You are a terrible partner!

19:07.564 --> 19:11.151
And from now on, if I want something done,
I'm just gonna do it myself!

19:11.235 --> 19:13.153
-Could you--
-You see, Carol?

19:13.237 --> 19:16.657
Swiping things off of desks
and storming out of rooms is my thing!

19:16.740 --> 19:19.034
Okay. You two, go back to your floor.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.496
And you,
stop treating the janitor like he's a spy.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.998
And you, stop being Satan.

19:25.082 --> 19:28.669
And you, go back to wherever you live
or work 'cause it ain't here.

19:28.752 --> 19:32.673
And gentlemen, I am sorry
for any harassment you experienced,

19:32.756 --> 19:35.342
and I promise you it will never
happen again. Okay?

19:37.010 --> 19:38.053
Thank you.

19:38.762 --> 19:39.763
Okay.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.643
Meeting adjourned.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.980
-That was a meeting? That was a meeting.
-That's it?

19:52.025 --> 19:55.279
Hey, Brad. Listen, man,
I'm sorry about before.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.614
You know, I didn't give you a chance,
and that's not fair.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.866
I appreciate you saying that.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.868
Yeah. I mean, look, everyone can change.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.578
And, you know, I'm glad you're back.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.246
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.164
And, I mean,
you have nothing to worry about.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.624
-Yeah.
-I mean, there's nothing,

20:07.708 --> 20:10.002
-like strange or nefarious going on.
-Yeah.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.379
And even if there was,
you'd never know it.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.215
Right, yeah. And-- Sorry, wait, what?

20:15.299 --> 20:18.093
Anything that may or may not be
afoot shouldn't concern you

20:18.177 --> 20:19.178
because anything that would

20:19.261 --> 20:22.181
or wouldn't happen would do so
without your knowledge or awareness.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.350
And even if it did happen, you wouldn't
understand what it was or wasn't.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.812
So it's all perfectly fine
as far as you're concerned.

20:30.939 --> 20:31.982
Sorry, no.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.859
That's actually not fine. Because I'm--

20:33.942 --> 20:35.611
David, just trust me.

20:35.694 --> 20:38.322
You're never gonna find any dirt on me

20:38.989 --> 20:42.409
because I'm the janitor.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.040
So sus.

20:56.215 --> 20:59.384
-Should we wake her?
-No.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.971
That's about a six-hour sugar coma
she's put herself into.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.015
Can't say the woman's not dedicated.

21:05.599 --> 21:08.727
Well, I guess that's it for the day.
Wanna roll?

21:08.810 --> 21:09.811
Yeah.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.023
Oh, shit. Wait. Is that VIVE Pro Eye gear?

21:13.106 --> 21:14.816
-You know it?
-Yeah!

21:14.900 --> 21:17.319
I mean, I haven't played it yet,
but I heard it's dope.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.364
I don't know if it could keep up
with the Reverb G2 though.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.743
Wait, so you're into VR?
By any chance, are you into the metaverse?

21:24.826 --> 21:27.788
I mean, I don't know if anyone could be
into the metaverse,

21:27.871 --> 21:29.873
but I think we exist through it
and around it.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.419
That barely makes any sense,
and yet, I totally understand.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.175
-You wanna plug in?
-Hell, yeah.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.760
Let's go.
