00:02.027 --> 00:03.176
I bought the Ginsu knife.

00:04.707 --> 00:06.743
I did buy the Ginsu knife.

00:06.907 --> 00:10.183
I know, you can't believe it,
but I did, I swear. I saw it.

00:10.347 --> 00:11.746
It was late, I'm watching...

00:11.907 --> 00:15.024
...and it started making sense to me.
I'm thinking:

00:15.187 --> 00:18.099
"Yeah, cut through the shoe,
cut through the can, yeah.

00:18.267 --> 00:19.461
Yeah, I want that."

00:19.627 --> 00:22.187
So I called up the number
on the screen, you know...

00:22.347 --> 00:25.384
...and I said, " I'd like to order
the Ginsu knife."

00:25.547 --> 00:27.902
And the lady went, "Really?"

00:28.427 --> 00:30.304
I mean, even the Ginsu people
have given up.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.185
It's really so sad, you know.

00:32.347 --> 00:36.101
I guess, to be honest, if you need
a knife that can cut through a shoe...

00:36.267 --> 00:40.658
...perhaps you're not buying the
highest grade of meat available.

00:40.827 --> 00:45.105
Maybe you ought to think about not
getting the "hoof cut" once in a while.

00:51.147 --> 00:53.456
What is it about sleep
that mak es you so thirsty?

00:53.627 --> 00:55.583
Do dreams require liquid?

00:55.747 --> 00:59.023
It's not lik e I'm running a marathon,
I'm just lying there.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.179
What the hell?
Why is the door open?

01:05.387 --> 01:08.424
- Kramer, what are you doing here?!
- Jerry, now calm down. It's okay.

01:08.587 --> 01:10.259
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry.

01:10.427 --> 01:12.179
I didn't want to wake you up.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.303
I was watching
Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo...

01:14.467 --> 01:17.539
...and l... You know, I wanted
to get some popcorn...

01:17.707 --> 01:19.663
...so I used the spare keys
that you gave me...

01:19.827 --> 01:21.818
...to come in to get your popper.

01:21.987 --> 01:24.182
- You scared me!
- It's just me.

01:24.347 --> 01:28.022
- That's enough!
- Yeah, okay. Forgot the popper.

01:33.387 --> 01:35.503
It's not broken.

01:39.227 --> 01:41.946
Come on.

01:48.427 --> 01:49.940
Kramer!

01:50.107 --> 01:51.381
What are you doing?

01:51.547 --> 01:52.821
What does it look like? What?

01:52.987 --> 01:55.103
Get out of the bathroom. I gotta go!

01:55.267 --> 01:57.144
All right, all right.

01:57.587 --> 02:00.055
- Come on!
- All right.

02:00.587 --> 02:04.546
- Move it, move it! Get going!
- Well, my drain's all clogged up.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.741
- Is that my towel?
- Yes.

02:11.187 --> 02:13.985
I'm really happy the movie
was sold out.

02:14.147 --> 02:16.183
You ever pretend there's
murderers chasing you...

02:16.347 --> 02:18.781
...and see how fast you can
get into your apartment?

02:18.947 --> 02:21.507
I'm from Wichita.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.902
- There he is!
- Hurry, Jerry, he's coming.

02:25.067 --> 02:28.218
- He's coming. The murderers!
- Hurry. Hurry, he's coming. Hurry!

02:28.387 --> 02:30.298
Oh, Jerry.

02:31.947 --> 02:33.903
Boy, that was close.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.535
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

02:36.707 --> 02:42.179
- You were so fast with those keys.
- Well...

02:47.307 --> 02:48.501
- Beautiful.
- Kramer!

02:48.667 --> 02:50.066
What the hell are you doing here?

02:50.227 --> 02:53.299
Hey, Jerry, how are you? I thought
you were going to the movies.

02:53.467 --> 02:54.661
That's it, hand them over.

02:54.827 --> 02:56.146
- What?
- You know what. The keys.

02:56.307 --> 02:57.706
You've lost your key privileges.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.095
- Oh, come on.
- No "come on."

02:59.267 --> 03:01.497
- I thought you went to the movie.
- It was sold out.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.385
How was I to know
it would be sold out?

03:03.547 --> 03:05.060
- That's the point.
- What point?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.502
- Just give me the keys.
- Just give me another chance.

03:07.667 --> 03:08.986
- Don't ask me.
- I'm asking you.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.500
- I'm telling you.
- You're joking.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.225
- I'm serious.
- It won't happen again.

03:12.387 --> 03:14.025
- It will. Give me the keys.
- No.

03:14.187 --> 03:15.779
- Let go.
- You let go. Come on, Jerry.

03:15.947 --> 03:18.620
Now, stop it. Come on, Kramer.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.946
Oh, great! Okay, all right.

03:22.107 --> 03:23.859
Fine, you go ahead. Take the keys.

03:24.027 --> 03:25.665
But you're gonna regret this.

03:25.827 --> 03:27.818
All right, yeah.

03:32.387 --> 03:33.706
Goochie.

03:35.307 --> 03:37.582
- So put them in a safe place.
- I will.

03:37.747 --> 03:39.465
- Where?
- I don't know.

03:39.627 --> 03:40.901
I'll hide them.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.978
- So is Kramer upset?
- I think so.

03:43.147 --> 03:45.536
I mean, he's acting really weird lately.
He's different.

03:46.107 --> 03:48.416
- Just give him the keys back.
- No, I can't.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.223
Is that Kramer?

03:53.227 --> 03:55.661
- Who's there?
- Kramer.

03:56.667 --> 04:00.342
Hey. Oh, hi. Oh, you got the...

04:02.547 --> 04:05.459
- No, I am not...
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

04:05.627 --> 04:08.095
I don't care about the keys.
It's my fault.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.656
No, I gave the keys away
with my stupidity.

04:10.827 --> 04:13.216
I broke the covenant of the keys.

04:15.307 --> 04:17.696
- Jerry, give him the keys back.
- Elaine.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.380
- Here.
- What are you doing?

04:19.547 --> 04:21.458
- I'm giving him the keys.
- Those are my keys.

04:21.627 --> 04:24.187
- Let go! Jerry! No!
- Elaine. Come on.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.020
Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want the keys back.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.223
No, I'm glad the way
things turned out.

04:29.387 --> 04:31.218
I was clinging to those keys, man...

04:31.387 --> 04:34.185
...like a branch on the banks
of a raging river...

04:34.347 --> 04:35.780
...and now I have let go.

04:36.147 --> 04:39.059
And I'm free to go with the current...

04:39.227 --> 04:40.899
...to float.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.420
- And I thank you.
- Take the keys.

04:42.587 --> 04:44.623
- I don't want them.
- I want you to have them.

04:44.787 --> 04:47.176
- I don't want them! I can't.
- Come on. Take them!

04:47.347 --> 04:50.020
- No!
- Okay.

04:50.187 --> 04:51.666
Now, one more thing.

04:51.827 --> 04:53.465
I would like my keys back.

04:53.747 --> 04:56.261
- Your spare set?
- Yeah, that's right.

04:56.427 --> 04:58.338
- You want them back?
- Yeah, yeah...

04:58.507 --> 05:00.020
...I think it would be for the best.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.540
Gee, Kramer, I...

05:17.707 --> 05:18.901
I don't know what to say.

05:20.827 --> 05:22.624
Say yes.

05:22.787 --> 05:24.982
Yes, George, yes.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.617
- Yes?
- Yes.

05:27.787 --> 05:32.338
Should I give you my keys?
Is that the transaction, trading keys?

05:32.507 --> 05:34.896
- Because Elaine has my keys.
- You can get them back.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.986
I suppose I could.

05:37.747 --> 05:40.898
Because you see, George,
having the keys to Jerry's apartment...

05:41.067 --> 05:44.457
...that kept me in a fantasy world.

05:44.827 --> 05:47.899
Every time I went over to his house,
it was like I was on vacation.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.900
Better food, better view, better TV.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.898
Cleaner. Oh, much cleaner.

05:54.027 --> 05:55.301
That became my reality.

05:55.787 --> 05:57.982
I ignored the squalor
in my own life...

05:58.147 --> 06:01.184
...because I'm looking at life, you see,
through Jerry's eyes.

06:02.587 --> 06:03.986
I was living in twilight, George.

06:04.147 --> 06:07.457
Living in the shadows,
living in the darkness...

06:07.627 --> 06:09.060
...like you.

06:11.787 --> 06:13.425
- Me?
- Oh, yeah.

06:13.587 --> 06:15.418
I can barely see you, George.

06:16.587 --> 06:19.624
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.

06:20.707 --> 06:22.186
Hi. Are you ready to order?

06:22.347 --> 06:24.099
- Yeah. What's the...?
- No, not yet.

06:24.267 --> 06:26.258
Excuse me.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.581
Do you ever yearn?

06:34.107 --> 06:36.257
Yearn? Do I yearn?

06:36.907 --> 06:38.386
- I yearn.
- You yearn?

06:38.547 --> 06:40.265
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn.

06:40.427 --> 06:44.545
Often I sit and yearn.

06:45.267 --> 06:47.064
Have you yearned?

06:48.027 --> 06:50.257
Well, not recently.

06:50.987 --> 06:52.898
I craved.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.627
I crave all the time.
Constant craving.

06:55.787 --> 06:57.857
But I haven't yearned.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.378
- Look at you.
- Oh, Kramer, don't start.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.583
No, no. You're wasting your life.

07:04.747 --> 07:07.625
I am not.
What you call wasting, I call living.

07:07.787 --> 07:10.938
- I'm living my life.
- Okay, like what? No, tell me.

07:11.107 --> 07:12.984
- Do you have a job?
- No.

07:13.147 --> 07:15.058
- You got money?
- No.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.058
Do you have a woman?

07:17.547 --> 07:18.980
No.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.546
Do you have any prospects?

07:21.707 --> 07:23.459
No.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.936
You got anything on the horizon?

07:29.227 --> 07:30.819
No.

07:31.467 --> 07:34.743
- You have any action at all?
- No.

07:34.907 --> 07:38.297
Do you have any conceivable reason
for even getting up in the morning?

07:39.467 --> 07:42.220
I like to get the Daily News.

07:43.867 --> 07:47.576
George, it's time for us
to grow up and be men...

07:47.747 --> 07:49.817
...not little boys.
- Why?

07:49.987 --> 07:52.023
I'm going to California.
You know, I got the bug.

07:52.187 --> 07:54.337
Yeah, I think I got
a touch of something too.

07:54.507 --> 07:57.340
No, the acting bug. Ever since
I was in that Woody Allen movie.

07:58.027 --> 08:00.587
"These pretzels
are making me thirsty"?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.738
That was one line. You got fired.

08:02.907 --> 08:06.343
I know, I know.
But, man, I never felt so alive.

08:06.507 --> 08:09.544
- Now, you coming with me?
- No, I'm not.

08:09.707 --> 08:11.618
All right. Suit yourself.

08:11.787 --> 08:13.379
But let's keep this between us.

08:13.547 --> 08:15.583
We're key brothers now.

08:16.027 --> 08:18.143
You're not really gonna go
to California, are you?

08:18.307 --> 08:21.299
Up here, I'm already gone.

08:27.147 --> 08:28.580
He gave me his spare keys...

08:28.747 --> 08:31.215
...and now he wants my keys,
so I need mine back from you.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.537
Because you have his keys?
Why does he need yours?

08:33.707 --> 08:36.938
I don't know, he said
he wants to be my key brother.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.860
- That's ridiculous.
- That's Kramer.

08:40.506 --> 08:43.624
I'll give you back your spare keys,
but now I want mine back.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.659
What for?

08:45.827 --> 08:48.387
- Because I'll give them to Jerry.
- Jerry? Why?

08:48.547 --> 08:50.902
- Because he gave me his.
- So what?

08:52.107 --> 08:54.985
So if he has my keys,
I should have his.

08:55.147 --> 08:56.626
I don't see why if you have his...

08:56.787 --> 08:59.142
...he should have yours.
- I just said the same thing.

08:59.307 --> 09:01.821
- What?
- What?

09:01.987 --> 09:04.103
I'll give you my keys,
but I don't have them here.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.780
Can I have mine to give to Kramer?

09:06.187 --> 09:08.781
Yeah, okay, I'll go get them.

09:09.747 --> 09:14.025
What are you doing?
Would you just put that down?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.542
I gotta get some new friends.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.705
- Did you bring the keys?
- Yes.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.586
But I still don't feel right
about letting you into Kramer's.

09:22.747 --> 09:24.066
This could be an emergency.

09:24.227 --> 09:27.458
- You shouldn't have taken his keys.
- I tried to give them back.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.101
- How'd the Mets do?
- They lost.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.303
- Kramer!
- Come on, open it up.

09:35.707 --> 09:38.267
- Kramer?
- Hello, boys.

09:39.027 --> 09:42.144
- Hello, Newman.
- Are you looking for someone?

09:42.307 --> 09:44.343
Don't play coy with me,
I'm not in the mood.

09:44.507 --> 09:46.623
Coy? I'm not being coy.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.106
- Is he being coy?
- Yeah, coy.

09:48.267 --> 09:50.940
You're being coy.
Now, where's Kramer, Newman?

09:51.107 --> 09:53.905
- Who?
- Listen, Tiny...

09:54.667 --> 09:56.976
...I wanna know where Kramer is,
and I wanna know now!

09:57.147 --> 09:59.581
- Hit me, Seinfeld, I got witnesses.
- Turn around, George.

09:59.747 --> 10:00.896
- Sure.
- George?

10:01.067 --> 10:03.376
Tell me where Kramer is
or we'll do this the hard way!

10:03.547 --> 10:05.139
- Help! Help!
- Where's Kramer?

10:05.307 --> 10:06.660
- Help!
- What's going on?

10:06.827 --> 10:09.421
- They're gonna beat me up.
- No, we're not.

10:09.587 --> 10:11.305
We're trying to find Kramer.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.935
You want to know what happened
to Kramer? I'll tell you.

10:14.107 --> 10:15.859
He was ticked off about the keys.

10:16.027 --> 10:18.700
Yeah, that's right, about the keys.

10:19.627 --> 10:21.379
- Thought he got a bad rap.
- Bad rap?

10:21.547 --> 10:22.866
- Yeah, from you.
- Me?

10:23.027 --> 10:25.746
You heard me. So he packed a grip
and he split for the coast.

10:25.907 --> 10:27.784
La-la land. L.A.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.985
L.A.?

11:02.987 --> 11:05.182
I never should have taken
his keys away.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.542
He drove me to it, I had no choice.

11:07.707 --> 11:09.459
He wouldn't take them back.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.299
Elaine, you saw it. Remember?

11:11.467 --> 11:14.027
I said, "Take the keys back."
He wouldn't do anything.

11:14.187 --> 11:15.825
You saw it. Didn't you see it?

11:15.987 --> 11:17.818
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

11:17.987 --> 11:20.262
I mean, it was complete bull...
But I saw.

11:23.427 --> 11:24.906
- What?
- No, what'd you say?

11:25.067 --> 11:27.786
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

11:30.347 --> 11:31.621
Oh, you didn't see it?

11:31.787 --> 11:33.698
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.859
- I saw it. Yep.
- I heard you say something there.

11:37.027 --> 11:40.815
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm calling Kramer's mother.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.223
I don't know what you said,
but it was something.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.664
I heard something.

11:50.947 --> 11:53.700
Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer?

11:54.107 --> 11:55.665
Mrs. Kramer?

11:55.827 --> 11:58.466
Could you turn the music down?

11:58.627 --> 12:01.346
Could you turn the music down?

12:01.627 --> 12:04.983
- Ask her about Kramer.
- She's drunk out of her mind.

12:23.227 --> 12:25.741
Oh, my keys.

12:27.987 --> 12:30.262
This is perfect.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.421
Elaine, are you there?

12:37.067 --> 12:40.457
It's me. I'm locked out.
I need my spare keys. Where are you?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.663
I'm at the coffee shop.

12:45.947 --> 12:49.223
Hey! You ever been in an accident?

12:49.387 --> 12:51.139
About five years ago.

12:51.867 --> 12:54.427
I was going down this very road.

12:54.587 --> 12:59.263
Same time of day, going about
the same speed I'm going now.

12:59.427 --> 13:01.304
There was a rock in the road.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.344
It couldn't have been
more than a pebble.

13:03.507 --> 13:05.543
Never really saw it.

13:05.707 --> 13:10.098
Lost control of the bike,
went flying about a hundred feet.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.337
Came down right on my head.

13:12.507 --> 13:14.179
Cracked it wide open.

13:14.347 --> 13:18.340
Blood and stuff just splattered
all over the road there.

13:18.707 --> 13:21.460
Broke every bone in my face.

13:22.347 --> 13:23.826
You know, when they found me...

13:23.987 --> 13:27.059
...my eyes were hanging out
of their sockets.

13:27.587 --> 13:30.226
Yeah, they pronounced me dead
at the scene.

13:30.387 --> 13:34.346
Was in a coma for...
Well, they told me about a year.

13:34.507 --> 13:37.226
Said I'd be a vegetable for life.

13:37.387 --> 13:40.106
Yeah, but I showed them.

13:40.307 --> 13:43.538
Of course, since then,
I always wear a helmet.

13:43.827 --> 13:45.385
Lean.

13:46.307 --> 13:48.059
Lean!

13:52.907 --> 13:54.499
Georgie boy.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.942
Way to come through with the keys.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.179
- Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
- Look...

14:00.427 --> 14:03.783
...I just don't feel right about
letting you into Elaine's apartment.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.862
Don't feel right?
What are you talking about?

14:08.027 --> 14:10.495
I let you into Kramer's.
Now you wanna go into Elaine's.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.181
She entrusted me with her keys.
How can I just let you in?

14:13.347 --> 14:14.780
What is the big deal?

14:14.947 --> 14:16.858
Just because you have
someone's spare keys...

14:17.027 --> 14:18.619
...doesn't entitle you to break in.

14:18.787 --> 14:20.618
That's the reason you took
Kramer's keys.

14:20.787 --> 14:22.778
You're not even supposed
to have Elaine's keys.

14:22.947 --> 14:25.700
You're supposed to give them to her
so she can give them to me.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.937
So technically, those are my keys.

14:28.107 --> 14:30.018
If you'd never taken your keys
from Kramer...

14:30.187 --> 14:31.779
...he never would have given
his to me.

14:31.947 --> 14:34.825
In which case, I wouldn't have
had to take mine back from her.

14:35.867 --> 14:37.505
- I want those keys.
- No can do.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.544
- George, I want these.
- Stop it, let go.

14:39.707 --> 14:42.505
- George, I don't want to get physical.
- You wanna fight?

14:42.667 --> 14:43.941
- Wanna fight?
- I'll fight you!

14:44.107 --> 14:45.540
- Let's go.
- Nothing in the face!

14:45.707 --> 14:47.379
- Okay.
- All right.

14:50.667 --> 14:54.342
And then the evil ogre
took back the magical keys...

14:54.507 --> 14:56.065
...from the handsome young prince.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.981
Oh, no. He didn't
take back the keys.

15:01.147 --> 15:02.819
- No way.
- Yes.

15:02.987 --> 15:04.739
And then the handsome
young prince...

15:04.907 --> 15:07.705
...was cast out
into the cruel, cruel world.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.505
Oh, man, what a bummer.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.897
- That ogre dude is pretty cold, huh?
- He's cold.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.546
Let me tell you something, Kramer.

15:13.707 --> 15:16.904
If that ogre dude pulled
that crap on me...

15:17.067 --> 15:18.295
...l'd stab him!
- Wait.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.946
I'd cut him in half!

15:20.107 --> 15:22.667
I'd gut him like a fish, man!

15:22.827 --> 15:25.864
- That's what I'd do.
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be funny.

15:26.027 --> 15:27.585
Hey, you can drop me here.

15:27.747 --> 15:29.100
Hey, what's the rush, man?

15:29.267 --> 15:31.622
- Well, I got to be going now.
- Hey, Kramer...

15:31.787 --> 15:33.618
...have you ever killed a man?

15:33.787 --> 15:34.981
What do you think?

15:35.147 --> 15:39.140
You think these hands have been
soaking in lvory Liquid, huh?

15:39.307 --> 15:41.867
Oh, don't leave, Kramer.
Stay with us.

15:42.027 --> 15:44.222
Oh, you know so much
about the world. We need you.

15:44.387 --> 15:46.821
- Please, Kramer.
- Please, Kramer.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.500
Well, now, Star Cloud...

15:48.667 --> 15:50.305
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Please, Kramer.

15:50.467 --> 15:53.539
- No, no, no.
- Please, Kramer.

15:54.307 --> 15:56.263
See? You're avoiding
the middleman.

15:56.427 --> 15:58.941
You'd give her her keys,
which she would give to me.

15:59.107 --> 16:02.019
So instead of giving them to her,
you give them to me.

16:02.187 --> 16:05.304
Unfortunately, when she gave
you yours, you didn't give her hers.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.378
She'd give them to me
because she has mine.

16:07.547 --> 16:09.378
Then I wouldn't have to ask you
for hers...

16:09.547 --> 16:11.583
...so that I could get mine.

16:14.427 --> 16:16.987
You're right. How did I miss that?

16:18.667 --> 16:21.227
Maybe because it's a crock of sh...

16:22.387 --> 16:25.220
- What's that?
- Nothing.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.987
- I heard something.
- Didn't say anything.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.742
So how long you been driving
this thing?

16:37.907 --> 16:39.784
Going on four years.

16:41.027 --> 16:44.497
Well, nothing's sexier than a woman
behind the wheel of a semi.

16:45.187 --> 16:46.745
Nothing?

16:46.947 --> 16:48.539
Well...

16:52.587 --> 16:55.465
Listen to you.
You're quite the sweet talker.

16:55.627 --> 16:57.697
I always wanted to drive
the big rigs.

16:57.867 --> 17:00.984
I used to watch those commercials
during reruns of Gomer Pyle.

17:01.147 --> 17:03.786
- You wanna give it a try?
- Really?

17:05.227 --> 17:08.105
- Do you know how to double-clutch?
- Yeah.

17:08.426 --> 17:10.861
- Well, come on.
- Wait a minute.

17:11.027 --> 17:12.585
Wait.

17:15.987 --> 17:18.819
Okay. All right.

17:32.387 --> 17:34.298
They were in here.
I saw her put them in here.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.105
Well, this is great.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.144
- What do they look like?
- Like keys.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.298
They look like keys, George.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.300
They look exactly like keys.

17:43.467 --> 17:46.345
"What do they look like?"

17:46.827 --> 17:49.500
- They're obviously not here.
- They've got to be here.

17:49.667 --> 17:54.536
Jerry, unless I pull down on this
statuette and a hidden wall opens up...

17:54.707 --> 17:57.062
...we have checked every square inch
of this apartment.

17:58.747 --> 18:00.544
What is this?

18:02.107 --> 18:05.065
- "Murphy Brown"?
- What?

18:05.467 --> 18:07.458
- "By Elaine Benes"?
- What?

18:07.627 --> 18:09.857
Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?

18:10.707 --> 18:12.220
- Let me see this.
- Wait a second.

18:12.387 --> 18:14.025
- Let me just look at it.
- Wait.

18:14.187 --> 18:17.384
- Give me half!
- All right, here!

18:18.667 --> 18:20.658
Why didn't she tell us?

18:20.827 --> 18:24.900
Elaine is writing a sitcom?

18:29.907 --> 18:32.865
- You... You weasels!
- What?

18:33.027 --> 18:34.301
- What?
- How dare you!

18:34.467 --> 18:36.264
- We hardly read anything.
- It was funny.

18:36.427 --> 18:37.985
Who gave you permission
to come in...

18:38.147 --> 18:39.705
...and just go through my things?

18:39.867 --> 18:42.665
- You thought it was funny?
- Well, you know...

18:42.947 --> 18:45.700
...from what I saw...
- Well, it's just a first draft!

18:45.867 --> 18:48.062
I was locked out.
I'm just trying to get my keys.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.976
- Why did you let him in?
- He forced me to.

18:51.147 --> 18:52.296
- I did not!
- Yes, you did!

18:52.467 --> 18:56.016
- You, get out! Get out!
- Wait, I need my spare keys.

18:56.187 --> 18:58.178
Oh, here's your damn keys.
You keep them.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.780
- I don't want them anymore.
- Good.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.380
I want my keys back from you.

19:01.547 --> 19:03.777
- I can't hold them?
- No, you can't be trusted.

19:03.947 --> 19:05.938
All right, all right. Fine!

19:06.107 --> 19:08.746
- And I don't want you to hold mine.
- Good, I won't!

19:08.907 --> 19:10.056
Good, don't.

19:10.227 --> 19:12.218
- Are these my keys?
- These aren't my keys.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.821
- Whose are these?
- I don't know.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.739
No, those are yours...

19:27.187 --> 19:29.064
I just thought I could write it.

19:29.227 --> 19:31.183
Is that something you wanna do?

19:31.347 --> 19:33.099
I don't know.

19:33.267 --> 19:36.304
Those writers make a lot of money.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.615
What?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.982
Let me tell you something
about show business.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.582
- I can't believe it.
- It's hard work.

19:45.747 --> 19:47.738
You don't just write
a Murphy Brown.

19:47.907 --> 19:50.467
You gotta watch the show,
get a sense of the characters...

19:50.627 --> 19:52.265
...how they relate to each other.

19:52.427 --> 19:55.146
Okay, can I just watch the show?

19:56.907 --> 19:59.865
Oh, God, what an ass...

20:05.027 --> 20:06.858
What did you say?

20:08.427 --> 20:10.338
I didn't say anything.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.697
I heard something.

20:15.107 --> 20:16.586
Elaine, Elaine, it's Kramer!

20:16.747 --> 20:19.386
Kramer's on Murphy Brown!

20:20.587 --> 20:22.543
- Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
- Look, there he is!

20:22.707 --> 20:24.902
He's sitting at the desk!

20:25.467 --> 20:26.661
Hi, I'm Murphy Brown.

20:26.827 --> 20:29.580
- You must be my new secretary.
- Good morning, Miss Brown.

20:29.747 --> 20:32.625
- And you are?
- I'm Steven Snell.

20:32.787 --> 20:34.425
- Snell.
- Yes.

20:34.587 --> 20:36.384
Well, hello, Mr. Snell.

20:36.547 --> 20:37.821
Steven.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.136
- Steven.
- Yes.

20:39.307 --> 20:41.138
Are you familiar with this
computer system?

20:41.307 --> 20:44.185
Oh, I'm familiar, yes.

20:44.347 --> 20:47.145
Steven Snell, I know people...

20:47.307 --> 20:49.696
...and I have a very good feeling
about you.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.698
Yes.

21:01.187 --> 21:04.259
So I fly a lot. I was on a plane
the other day and I was wondering...

21:04.427 --> 21:08.261
...are there keys to the plane?
Do they need keys to start the plane?

21:08.427 --> 21:11.942
Maybe that's what those delays on the
ground are sometimes, at the gate.

21:12.107 --> 21:14.177
Maybe the pilot's up in
the cockpit going:

21:14.347 --> 21:16.178
"Oh, I don't believe this.

21:16.347 --> 21:18.338
Oh, my God...

21:18.507 --> 21:20.498
...I did it again."

21:21.067 --> 21:22.341
They tell you it's mechanical.

21:22.507 --> 21:24.463
They don't want to come on
the PA system:

21:24.627 --> 21:25.821
"Ladies and gentlemen...

21:25.987 --> 21:28.501
...we're gonna be delayed here
a little while. I...

21:28.787 --> 21:31.301
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.220
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment."

21:34.387 --> 21:36.901
You see technicians,
you think they're servicing it...

21:37.067 --> 21:40.218
...but they're looking for the magnet
Hide-A-Key under the wing.

21:40.387 --> 21:42.981
"Maybe he left it up there
somewhere."
