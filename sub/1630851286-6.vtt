In closing,
Lightyear Capsule is an app
that allows you to store

00:16.317 --> 00:19.787
and lock away pictures,
voice memos and messages

00:19.820 --> 00:22.490
that can't be unlocked
by anyone, including yourself,

00:23.191 --> 00:24.858
except for who you designate

00:25.159 --> 00:27.828
and on the date in the future
you choose.

00:30.664 --> 00:35.336
Tyler Pitt and Omar...

00:35.636 --> 00:36.637
Johnson!

00:36.670 --> 00:37.505
Johnson.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.507
I don't know.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.976
I must say,
while listening to that pitch,

00:43.010 --> 00:47.815
I couldn't help
but think about leaving
an unopened message and picture

00:47.848 --> 00:49.517
for my great-grandchildren.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.720
So when they go to college

00:53.154 --> 00:55.823
to remember how
extraordinarily handsome I was.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.492
[All Laughing]

00:58.726 --> 01:02.163
They would probably see
it was from you
and hit the ignore button.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.165
Is there like a snooze button?

01:04.198 --> 01:06.200
Well there is no snooze button,

01:06.234 --> 01:09.002
but you can choose
to not open it,
if you don't want to.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.872
Then I think we can all agree
you've got something here.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.708
Let's talk about numbers.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.210
I'm glad you brought that up.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.747
This is where you'll see
the real value
in Lightyear Capsule.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.387
[percussive Hip-hop theme]

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
* Strength in numbers

01:27.688 --> 01:30.591
* When you're under
I'm the one that you call

01:30.824 --> 01:33.461
* Since day one,
ten toes down

01:33.494 --> 01:35.529
*I'm gonna ride
for my bros (yeah)

01:35.563 --> 01:37.030
* You know if I got it
The you got it

01:37.064 --> 01:39.600
* Homie you ain't gotta
ask no questions

01:39.833 --> 01:43.404
*What I look like grinding
hard just to be selfish

01:43.671 --> 01:46.274
* You ain't gotta ask

01:48.542 --> 01:50.544
* if I'm my brother's keeper

01:50.578 --> 01:52.913
*I shine, you shine

01:55.749 --> 01:56.884
Kevin, that's great!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.353
Well listen,
I already instructed my team

01:59.387 --> 02:02.055
to put a list of properties
together for you
and your father to review.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.458
So I'm just waiting
on the official
agreement and deposit.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.395
Alright, well we're
hoping to have a contract
to you by tomorrow,

02:07.428 --> 02:10.097
then we can
move forward with
an official press release.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.265
Press release?

02:11.299 --> 02:14.067
Uh, aye, one second Kevin.
What's up, Danni?

02:14.101 --> 02:15.369
Your 11 o'clock is here.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.438
Okay, I'm just
finishing up a call.
You can send them in.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.606
Okay!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.874
Kev, listen, um...
let's uh,
let's discuss this later,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.410
about the press release.
I gotta run.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.278
Is there a problem?

02:24.312 --> 02:25.579
No, no, no, no, no.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.315
I just didn't know
I was gonna have
to do a press release.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.384
Might have to hire some
bodyguards.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.285
Ha!

02:31.319 --> 02:33.454
Well, just don't
turn into a divo, Jarvis.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.588
Talk soon bud.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.727
Yo! Aye, Keith!

02:39.760 --> 02:41.061
What's up, baby?
What you doing here?

02:41.094 --> 02:41.595
What's up man?

02:42.430 --> 02:43.564
Oh you know,
just needed some advice.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.898
Figured I should
make an appointment

02:44.932 --> 02:47.235
since you're like
the biggest agent in the city
or whatever.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.769
Oh man, I'm sorry.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.771
I got my 11 o'clock,
and they're already here.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.641
Let's see, Mari..Juana.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.145
Really?

03:00.147 --> 03:02.115
What's so funny, Danni?

03:02.149 --> 03:05.653
I'm just trying to figure out
who this new Jarvis is.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.088
'Cause you talking
real different right now.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.458
Well hey, don't let that
title fool you, okay?

03:10.491 --> 03:13.794
Jarvis here, used to skip school
with Mari Juana all the time!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.963
Aye, don't be putting
all my business out there Keith!

03:15.996 --> 03:18.098
Danni, thank you,
you can file this.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.800
And you can go now, thank you.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.468
I already filed it.

03:21.469 --> 03:21.969
[whispering]
We'll talk about it on Sunday.

03:22.002 --> 03:22.703
Okay!

03:24.372 --> 03:26.607
You do that,
and we not talking no more.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.309
I"m a see you in the courts
a little later,

03:28.342 --> 03:29.677
why you here bothering me?

03:29.710 --> 03:33.681
Well, you know how I been
wanting to get my
gallery going?

03:33.714 --> 03:34.482
[Jarvis] Yeah.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.517
It's time.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.018
What?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.287
Okay!

03:39.320 --> 03:40.153
I'm proud of you, man.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.623
I found this space.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.824
Okay, oh wow.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.225
You serious.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.329
So, what's the problem?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.364
How do I put this?
Money.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.534
Yeah, the agent said
that she could try to get me
a short term lease,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.370
but that the rent
would almost double in price.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.172
Short term lease, makes sense
that it's more expensive.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.175
But, brick and mortars
are suffering
in this part of town,

04:02.209 --> 04:03.877
so you may be able
to get it down a bit.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.814
Well, I was just hoping
that maybe you could
search for something similar,

04:06.847 --> 04:08.482
because, I mean,
that place is perfect.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.385
Okay, first, let me put a call
in to the agent.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.487
See if I can negotiate it down.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.655
Really?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.890
I mean I wouldn't
want to put you out
but okay, great!

04:16.924 --> 04:18.692
Thank you so much,
I'd appreciate that.

04:18.726 --> 04:22.029
Yeah, uh,
and that's why you came?

04:22.062 --> 04:24.164
[stuttering] How are you?

04:24.197 --> 04:25.198
Well, thank you, I'm we--

04:25.232 --> 04:25.833
Glad to hear it, buddy.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.836
And, so...

04:28.869 --> 04:29.437
Okay!

04:29.470 --> 04:30.571
* Everyday, everyday, day

04:30.771 --> 04:32.906
* You ain't with the
business I can tell

04:33.507 --> 04:36.410
* You can't even keep
your business to yourself

04:36.744 --> 04:39.713
* I been getting back
and came up with an L

04:39.747 --> 04:40.781
* Playin' with these hitters

04:41.081 --> 04:44.084
* how you play yourself,
I wish you well.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.654
* Yeah, yeah,
I wish you well.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.690
* Hustle ain't a hustle
when you do it for yourself

04:49.723 --> 04:52.926
* All the change you looking
for is in the wishing well.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.229
* Yeah, yeah,
I wish you well.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.901
Yo, big bruh,
we got H20 for sale.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.036
What's good, man,
I was just going in
to get me a Gatorade!

05:03.070 --> 05:04.572
Nah, man, shop with us.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.706
We got three for ten.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.574
Three for ten!

05:06.607 --> 05:08.609
Got my boys taxing, man.
[Boy #2] Yeah.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.744
Aight look, this what I'll do.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.745
I got five.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.246
Bro, stop being cheap!

05:13.280 --> 05:14.247
Man y'all...

05:14.281 --> 05:17.284
Uh-uh, no, we'll take the five.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.220
Look, I respect
what y'all doing,

05:20.253 --> 05:21.389
but if you want
to make some money

05:21.422 --> 05:22.956
you got to work
on your customer service skills.

05:23.156 --> 05:23.991
You dig?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.292
Yeah.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.295
Appreciate you.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.068
Hell good looking, bruh.

05:35.102 --> 05:35.969
Stay up!

05:43.944 --> 05:45.413
What's good, man?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.614
How you doing?

05:46.647 --> 05:49.483
Let me get, uh,
two of them
Big Money scratch offs.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.120
[traffic noises]

05:55.956 --> 05:56.990
Ah!

05:58.325 --> 05:59.393
Let's go.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.462
At least a free ticket.
Come on!

06:01.495 --> 06:03.096
Ahhh!

06:08.636 --> 06:09.870
What the hell?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.343
Are you serious?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.017
Yo!

06:30.023 --> 06:31.158
What are you doing?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.160
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!

06:33.193 --> 06:33.827
[Jarvis] What is he doing?

06:33.861 --> 06:34.828
[Omar] He is terrible.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.329
He's one of the worst
basketball players ever.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.197
[Jarvis] He can't miss it
if he don't shoot it.
[Omar] Look at him.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.165
Look how he's drilling.

06:38.198 --> 06:38.866
Oh!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.535
Oh my God!
You are terrible.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.636
Yo!

06:42.670 --> 06:48.008
Aye, Greg,
is that new tint?
[Laughs]

06:48.041 --> 06:50.343
Before you say anything,
I just got to know.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.680
Did the water boys
pull out water guns?

06:52.713 --> 06:57.384
[All Laughing]

06:57.417 --> 06:58.218
Very funny.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.187
Aye, man listen.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.690
I'm just kidding man,
I'm glad to see
you alright, bruh.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.190
Yeah, me too.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.357
Yeah, same man.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.659
I mean, what did they take?

07:05.693 --> 07:10.030
They took my wallet,
my credit cards,
and Ariana's cellphone.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.699
Man, I ain't heard
that name in a long time.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.866
What the hell is going on, Greg?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.335
Aye, tell 'em Greg,
tell 'em.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.238
So, the other night,
I get a passenger.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.208
And it just happened
to be Ariana.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.244
Now, now I was gonna cancel
at first, but I was like

07:24.277 --> 07:27.247
That'd be giving her
too much power over me,
you know what I'm saying?

07:28.415 --> 07:30.050
Yeah, so I took the ride.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.585
She left her phone in my car.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.854
Do you hear yourself?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.856
Yeah, do you expect us
to believe that?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.224
Yeah, actually I do.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.426
The question is,
what did Serena say?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.228
I ain't tell Serena,
she'd never believe me.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.296
But what did the police say?

07:44.431 --> 07:45.766
I ain't call the police, Keith.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.234
Why not?
They stole from you.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.570
Aye Jarvis, now, do you remember
in middle school

07:49.603 --> 07:52.573
when you stole that
starter jacket from Foot Locker,
in middle school?

07:52.606 --> 07:53.440
That was totally different.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.608
How is it different?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.878
Aight, fine, we just,
we excuse the criminals.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.746
Cool.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.247
We're not
excusing criminals, Jarvis.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.616
We're letting little black boys
make mistakes
and do dumb stuff

08:02.650 --> 08:04.284
the same way we did
when we were kids.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.052
Right.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.253
Without getting criminal
records.

08:06.286 --> 08:06.920
Right.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.088
Let's play basketball.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.057
Aye, me and Jarvis.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.626
You and this terrible guy,
Keith.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.929
Alright, I'm with that,
I'm with that.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.631
Get over there,
get over there!

08:17.665 --> 08:18.265
Fine!

08:18.298 --> 08:20.100
Here we go.

08:20.133 --> 08:24.304
Okay, that was the wind,
that was the wind!

08:25.338 --> 08:29.309
Actually, fellas after thinking
about it, I agree with both
you guys' perspectives.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.745
Now some of these kids
are bad as hell.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.446
But the court system
is not the way.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.984
I mean it is literally set up
to rob us of our purpose.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.786
When's the hearing?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.421
On the 15th.

08:41.454 --> 08:42.823
Are we invited?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.925
Keith, you act like it's a
bachelor party.
[Omar] Right.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.827
I mean, it kinda is.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.495
Oh, it's gonna,
all gonna workout, brother.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.163
Thank you, Jarvis.
What is...

08:50.197 --> 08:53.834
Right, make sure you get
that alimony, alimony!

08:53.867 --> 08:55.135
Whoa!

08:55.168 --> 08:56.937
You're horrible, man!
[Keith] What?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.439
If the roles were reversed
they'd be doing the same thing.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.674
Nah, it's totally
different for men.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.809
That's a weak ass move.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.276
A weak ass move?

09:03.310 --> 09:07.514
Jarvis, now men and women
can't be equal
when it's convenient, right?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.149
We got to keep
that same energy.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.351
Yeah, yeah,
my lawyer's saying
the same thing.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.354
But I don't want her money.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.657
I just want my son.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.660
What happened, Omar?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.161
Yeah, you can tell us.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.164
Was you taking down
the babysitter?

09:24.832 --> 09:27.167
I was the babysitter, fool.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.869
Okay, I guess
that's a no.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.004
Listen man, some women
want to mold you

09:31.038 --> 09:32.840
into a version of the man
they want you to be.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.842
But then when they realize
it's not gonna happen,

09:34.875 --> 09:36.543
it changes the dynamic
of the relationship.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.379
And you just,
start arguing over everything.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.982
Lisa and I go
through the same thing
and we still rocking.

09:42.015 --> 09:42.983
You just got to communicate.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.318
Well that's a little different.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.654
'Cause she's white?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.221
Lisa's white?

09:48.255 --> 09:49.723
[Jarvis] Okay!

09:51.391 --> 09:54.728
Man, you know how much hate
I get from black folks
because of who I chose to marry?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.730
Right?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.732
When I got to the restaurants
in the black neighborhoods,
I see the stares.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.566
[Jarvis] I see the whispers.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.001
That's because of how it looks.

10:01.034 --> 10:01.769
Oh, how's that?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.238
Another successful black man
with a white woman.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.708
With all these beautiful
black women out here, right?

10:07.741 --> 10:08.842
Jarvis, Greg has a point.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.878
No, I didn't choose Lisa
because she wasn't black.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.680
I fell in love with who she is
as a person.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.848
I don't know why that's
so hard to understand!

10:14.882 --> 10:17.417
Yo, black women weren't
checking with me
when I didn't have nothing!

10:17.450 --> 10:19.552
Now I got something,
all the sudden I sold out?

10:19.586 --> 10:20.888
Man, miss me with that.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.355
I don't even know why
I'm explaining this to y'all.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.223
I thought we were here to ball!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.557
Hey,hey, hey,
you know what Jarvis?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.226
You're right.
Let's play basketball.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.627
It's what we came here for,
let's go man.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.263
What rock we using?

10:30.731 --> 10:31.799
Yours.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.433
Black ball.
Keith, you not ready
for this work.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.268
Black rock, black top,
let's go!

10:35.635 --> 10:36.569
Let's go.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.905
Yeah, yeah,
I'm on this guy right here!

10:37.938 --> 10:40.708
Easy work, easy work.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.942
Aye, aye, don't be pushing.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.044
Aye, don't be pushing me man.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.047
Where you going,
where you going,
where you going?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.615
Oh, okay that's a foul.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.616
That was all ball!

10:49.649 --> 10:50.517
You hit me in the back
of the head.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.886
I didn't touch you man,
stop crying.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.754
What?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.288
So y'all wanna play
football instead?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.623
Hey, hey, hey, hey guys.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.126
Aye, aye, aye!
Just stop arguing
and let's play ball, come on!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.261
I'm dressed for it, so.
[Greg] I mean, Jarvis over here
crying.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.095
Ain't nobody crying.

11:02.129 --> 11:02.730
You ready?

11:02.763 --> 11:03.296
I'm ready!

11:03.330 --> 11:04.431
Stop crying then, man.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.132
[Jarvis] Ain't nobody crying!

11:05.165 --> 11:06.133
Ball in!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.968
You guys ready?
Let's go.
[Jarvis] Yeah.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.302
Just dunk it this way.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.471
Aye, stop pushing man, stop.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.440
He ain't got it,
he ain't ready.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.108
To your left, to your left.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.579
Air ball!
It's our ball,
it went out of bounds.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.448
Aye, what's your problem?
[Greg] Don't be pushing me man!

11:21.481 --> 11:24.752
[All Yelling]

11:24.785 --> 11:26.787
Aye, you guys are supposed
to be brothers,
what are you doing?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.421
He needs to start acting
like it, man!

11:28.455 --> 11:30.157
If you got something to say,
then just say it!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.792
'Cause you know
you got a problem
with everything I do.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.460
Not everything, just the tom
foolery!

11:33.493 --> 11:36.463
[All Yelling]

11:36.496 --> 11:38.165
Chill, chill!

11:38.365 --> 11:41.134
I understand the hate
from some black people.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.137
And I'm not surprised
from hate from almost anyone.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.305
(yelling) But you?

11:46.339 --> 11:47.808
My brother?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.046
Man, we supposed to be...

11:58.385 --> 11:59.219
I'm out.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.521
Jarvis.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224
Jarvis, come back bro.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.360
[Greg] Let him go.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.561
Let him go.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.034
We could still play
a game of 21.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.069
Right?

12:17.537 --> 12:22.342
I got to go work
on some friend's um,
I'll see you guys later.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.046
What's up bro?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.514
A little one-on-one?

12:27.547 --> 12:28.849
What's up?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.733
I'm a just work on my jump shot!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.208
[Booker] But I was telling her
man...

12:55.242 --> 12:58.711
Man I had this one young girl,
boy, she took everything.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.747
I left out there
with just one shoe on!

13:00.948 --> 13:02.249
One shoe!

13:02.282 --> 13:04.084
I can't live like this no more.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.086
I swear I can't.

13:08.588 --> 13:13.226
Look I,
I think it's time for me to just
go ahead and settling.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.563
You know it's uh,
settle down and not settling.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.098
Whatever!

13:18.131 --> 13:21.734
I need you to hook me up
with some of Val's friends
that's in that book club.

13:21.768 --> 13:25.906
Them women are fine!

13:25.939 --> 13:28.741
Especially that little chubby
one, oh!

13:30.610 --> 13:32.913
You, you mean sister Greta?

13:32.946 --> 13:36.249
Do you understand
that is the deacon's widow?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.584
Perfect!

13:37.617 --> 13:39.386
That means she's single.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.121
Look at God!

13:41.154 --> 13:45.392
They say the best place to find
a good woman is either
in the church or in a library.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.594
That is where they run
to get away from men like you.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.097
Now look Booker,
stay the hell away
from my wife's friends.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.265
Come on,
don't act like that 'Gene!

13:52.299 --> 13:55.936
I need to find a woman
with good credit,
who can cook.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.604
That can dress.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.640
Except you can't do
any of those things,
not one!

14:00.974 --> 14:02.075
I can dress!

14:02.109 --> 14:03.243
You cannot!

14:03.276 --> 14:06.113
You always dress like you
going to a Peabo Bryson concert.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.616
Now look, I'll tell you what,
go down to Sweet Jimmy's
on Sunday.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.784
And there, you gonna find your
queen.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.787
She gonna be in the corner
with a Newport
and a fifth of Henny.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.790
Why would you say that man,
you know them women
ain't got no healthcare.

14:17.824 --> 14:18.926
Here, excuse me?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.160
Can I get another beer?

14:20.193 --> 14:23.163
Ah, man,those guys,
they didn't blink.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.165
Through the whole pitch!

14:25.832 --> 14:27.000
You handled that like a champ.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.002
We got a verbal commitment,
which is great.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.638
But, you know,
I wouldn't get too excited
until the ink dries.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.306
I'm just glad to be
out of the house.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.042
I got to celebrate when I can.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.045
Thank you.
[Phone Pings]

14:38.678 --> 14:39.679
Great.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.614
What is it?

14:41.648 --> 14:45.152
Uh, my daughter
just ran out of diapers.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.487
And I just ordered another beer.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.489
Hey look, I'm gonna be here
for a while, alright?

14:49.522 --> 14:51.791
So you could take off
and I'll take care of the tab.

14:51.824 --> 14:52.892
Mhm, hold on.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.363
What are you doing, Tyler?

14:56.396 --> 14:59.699
Googling how long a baby can go
without diapers.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.702
If you don't go home
and get some damn diapers.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
Aight, aight, I'm leaving.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.139
Yeah, get out of here.

15:06.173 --> 15:06.839
Have a good night.

15:06.873 --> 15:07.507
You too!

15:07.540 --> 15:08.708
Great work today.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.348
Is this seat taken?

15:15.382 --> 15:18.385
Um, no, no,
it's all yours.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.221
Are the drinks strong here?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.224
Yeah, the bartender
has a heavy hand.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.194
Wait a minute.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.428
Do I know you?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.866
I don't know, do you?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.368
It's me, Bianca.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.338
We spoke on the phone
a couple of weeks ago
after you sent me a DM.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.408
(stuttering)
Yeah, uh, Bianca, yeah.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.378
I remember that, uh,
I didn't recognize you.

15:45.412 --> 15:45.912
It's, um, your hair!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.380
It, it's different.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.115
It is.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.785
Can I have your house bourbon?
Neat.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.256
No chaser, huh?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.259
I go straight to the point.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.594
I see.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.732
So, what brings you here?

16:05.765 --> 16:07.134
Alone.

16:07.934 --> 16:12.272
I missed my red eye to Miami
and the next one is not until
six am.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.407
So, I figured I'll come here,
grab a drink.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.508
What about you?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.577
and then head back to
the airport later.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.145
What about you?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.747
Oh, I just finished
a business meeting.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.884
Actually, uh,
I'm probably gonna head out.

16:24.917 --> 16:25.818
Somebody has a curfew.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.588
Somebody has a curfew.

16:28.621 --> 16:32.959
No, trust me,
I don't have a curfew.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.730
Look, you are gonna stay
a little while longer

16:37.764 --> 16:40.267
and keep me company, right?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.804
I might have a few minutes.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.413
So, you just message
random girls on Instagram?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.448
No, no, not at all.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.984
So, why didn't you call me then?

16:58.017 --> 17:04.157
Well you seem like the type
that'll lead someone on and
then hurt their feelings later.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.827
People's feelings only get hurt
if they assume

17:07.860 --> 17:09.662
that we are more
than what we are.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.332
And that's not my fault.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.636
Okay.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.505
[Bianca] Salut.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.311
Salut, salut.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.061
So I see you opened
the expensive bottle of scotch.

17:42.462 --> 17:46.199
And you only do that
after you've had a long day.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.534
You want to talk about it?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.737
Greg and I
kind of got into it today.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.972
About what?

17:53.906 --> 17:54.974
Everything.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.744
Me, you.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.913
I'm just tired
of defending my blackness
to him.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.024
Greg has a lot
of growing up to.

18:12.058 --> 18:15.662
But that's his problem,
not yours.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.733
Things just seem different
ever since we moved back.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.437
People change.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.940
People grow,
and that's okay!

18:28.841 --> 18:33.346
But if this friendship isn't
serving you anymore

18:35.014 --> 18:38.785
it might be time
to just let it go.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.423
Maybe you're right.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.567
Watch out now.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.303
Oh!
[Jarvis] Uh huh.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.306
Thank you.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.474
You're welcome.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.477
I appreciate you.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.183
I should have known
you were an Aquarius.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.584
Oh yeah, why is that?

19:11.618 --> 19:12.652
Confident.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.790
But emotional and very stubborn.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.960
Yeah, well you know
you fire signs are always
so judgmental.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.997
But um, I'll let you slide
this time.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.165
Okay.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.800
[Bartender] You two care
for another drink?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.669
No!
Yes!

19:31.638 --> 19:33.806
Bianca, I really should go,
aight?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.243
I have a very early morning.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.011
Yeah, I've used that line
before.

19:44.584 --> 19:49.088
Aye 'Gene,
ain't that your nephew
right there?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.925
Look at that pretty, young thing
he with!

19:53.526 --> 19:55.161
Ain't he married?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.664
Legally.

19:57.697 --> 20:02.469
See now, I can get busy
and jiggy with something
like that!

20:02.502 --> 20:05.838
No, no, no, what we gonna do,
is we gonna sit here,
have our drinks

20:05.872 --> 20:06.839
and mind our own business.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.007
He got two.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.776
Why can't he give one to me?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.712
Your whole family is selfish.
