WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.340
HIGGINS:
Torres.

00:06.374 --> 00:09.077
Torres. Torres.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.711
Torres.
Yeah.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.246
Check it out.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.116
Looks like a normal belt.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.317
It's actually a knife.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.121
How about this comb?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.590
Looks like a regular comb.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.292
It's actually a knife.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.626
I never go
anywhere without it.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.660
So, if there's trouble,

00:26.694 --> 00:28.296
I got your back.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.532
I got an ink pen.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.134
Huh? Looks like
a normal ink pen.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.368
Is it a knife?

00:34.402 --> 00:37.138
It's... it's a hidden camera.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.772
Why?
I'm a gadget guy.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.474
No. Why are you still talking?

00:40.508 --> 00:41.709
I'm an anxious talker.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.744
Oh, okay, so you were
anxious all night?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.713
'Cause you talked all night.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.615
Clearly, you are not willing to
participate in this partnership.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.650
(chuckles)

00:49.683 --> 00:50.784
We're not partners.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.253
(exhales)

00:53.787 --> 00:56.790
Okay, this is Metro Detective
Miles Higgins

00:56.824 --> 00:58.659
on a joint stakeout

00:58.692 --> 01:03.364
with NCIS Special Agent
Nick Torres.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.566
We are here to arrest
a Vernon Douglas

01:05.599 --> 01:07.201
on a dual count
of drug trafficking.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.636
So far he's a no-show,

01:08.669 --> 01:11.339
but we are going to wait
as long as it takes.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.207
Because we're partners.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.742
Right, Nick?

01:14.775 --> 01:16.577
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.579
Yeah. Can I, can I borrow this?

01:18.612 --> 01:21.382
(clears throat)

01:21.415 --> 01:23.551
HIGGINS: Hey!
TORRES: Ha. It's not just a pen.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.819
Look at that: it's a Frisbee.
(laughs)

01:25.853 --> 01:28.656
I got to make a phone call.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.724
(car door closes)

01:30.758 --> 01:32.693
Hey, McGee? You got
to take over for me, man.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.828
This guy's driving me crazy.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.231
McGEE: So, why would I
want to take over?
But you'd love him.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.167
Uh, Nick,
I really think you two

01:39.200 --> 01:40.601
should try and work things out.
(vehicle approaching)

01:40.634 --> 01:43.237
(loud rock music plays on radio)
TORRES: Hold on, McGee.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.773
Got to go.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.341
Higgins?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.842
Our boy just pulled
into the south side alley.

01:48.876 --> 01:49.843
Meet me around the back.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
(loud music continues playing)

01:51.412 --> 01:52.713
* Every night

01:52.746 --> 01:56.184
* Street light

01:56.217 --> 01:58.286
* I drink my booze

01:58.319 --> 02:00.354
* Some run

02:00.388 --> 02:01.889
* Some fight

02:02.823 --> 02:05.793
* But I win, they lose

02:05.826 --> 02:06.927
* What I need, I like

02:06.960 --> 02:09.863
* What I don't, I fight

02:09.897 --> 02:11.899
* And I don't like you

02:13.667 --> 02:16.537
* Say bye-bye
while you're still alive *

02:16.570 --> 02:19.307
* Your time is through

02:19.340 --> 02:21.242
(grunts)
* 'Cause I'm a problem child

02:23.311 --> 02:25.813
* 'Cause I'm a problem child

02:25.846 --> 02:29.283
* Yeah,
I'm a problem child *

02:29.317 --> 02:32.320
* Yeah, problem child

02:32.353 --> 02:33.821
(gasps)

02:33.854 --> 02:36.890
* Problem child

02:36.924 --> 02:40.728
* I'm a problem child

02:40.761 --> 02:45.199
* Problem child...

02:45.233 --> 02:47.968
Higgins, where the hell are you?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.870
Higgins!

02:49.903 --> 02:53.441
TORRES (over radio): Higgins.
Hey, I thought you had my back.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.710
*

03:24.972 --> 03:26.774
(Bishop yawns)

03:26.807 --> 03:28.576
Morning, Bishop.
Morning, McGee.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.279
What do you got there?
Did I miss a new case?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.946
Uh, nope. Old case.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.782
Ducky's been e-mailing
all morning.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.251
Ducky is in Scotland.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.919
Yeah. By morning,
I mean his morning,

03:38.952 --> 03:39.787
my night.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.256
All night.
Why?

03:42.290 --> 03:44.592
'Cause in addition to receiving
an honorary degree,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.360
Ducky was also asked
to give a guest lecture.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.828
Oh, I didn't know that.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.830
Well, neither did Ducky,
so he asked me

03:49.863 --> 03:52.833
to dig into NCIS archives

03:52.866 --> 03:54.968
and scan some case files.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.271
Ooh. There's a lot
to choose from.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.606
Let me guess, The Meat Puzzle?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.274
That was a thing?
Before your time.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.475
Or he could talk
about Jack in the Box.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.610
That was a good one.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.044
Chimney Mummy?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.414
Shower Blood? Pommel Horse?

04:06.447 --> 04:08.015
Okay. Now you're just
saying words.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.583
These are all real cases.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.552
This one is even
before your time.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.686
Death of
Colonel Metzger?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.987
Oh. Body-in-a-Body.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.789
I heard about that one.
Hey, Jimmy.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.591
Did I miss
Bring Your Pallet to Work Day?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.059
No, the, uh, medical
supply driver

04:19.092 --> 04:20.894
went to the wrong
department. He's new.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.796
Hey, have you guys

04:22.830 --> 04:24.732
heard from Dr. Mallard?
I haven't spoken to him

04:24.765 --> 04:27.034
since he left.
No. Just e-mail.
But hold on,

04:27.067 --> 04:29.303
can we go back
to Body-in-a-Body?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.538
How did that work?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.473
GIBBS:
It wasn't pretty.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.707
Grab your gear.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.075
Great Nick Torres called.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.644
Is the joint stakeout over?

04:36.677 --> 04:37.911
That's a good question.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.946
(Jimmy grunts)

04:42.850 --> 04:45.319
Hey.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.954
I cuffed Vernon,
dragged him to the car.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.590
That's when I noticed
that Higgins was gone.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.726
At first, I thought he was
trying to teach me a lesson.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.395
About what?

04:54.428 --> 04:55.596
Partnerships.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.064
Eh, it's a long story.

04:57.097 --> 05:00.834
When backup arrived,
still Higgins didn't show,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.571
I-I got worried.
I hate joint investigations.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.973
Detective Sportelli.
It's been a while.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.741
Agent Gibbs. It's been so long

05:07.775 --> 05:10.010
it's actually
Detective-Sergeant Sportelli.

05:10.043 --> 05:10.778
Congratulations.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.113
Same pay, more
responsibility.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.983
One of them being the safety
of my fellow detectives.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.385
It true you abandoned
your partner?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.886
What?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.854
No, no, no. He abandoned me.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.723
We must have
a hostage situation.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.392
We got no evidence
to support that.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.059
It's the only explanation
for one of my detectives

05:26.093 --> 05:27.828
leaving an active stakeout.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.029
He must've
been taken.

05:29.062 --> 05:29.897
BISHOP:
Well,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.732
I searched the area.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.901
No blood,
no sign of a struggle.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.369
See?
See?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.004
No. It means he walked away.

05:37.037 --> 05:37.871
Or it means he was knocked out.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.407
GIBBS: We don't
know what it means.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.608
Knock it off.
McGEE:
Hey, boss.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.075
Look what I found
on the ground.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.413
Check this out.
Looks like an ink pen, right?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.448
Yeah, but it's actually
a spy camera.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.385
Yeah, I told you
Higgins was a gadget guy.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.621
Yeah, well,
I think it's been recording.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.691
I'm sorry. Yeah.
Can I, can I borrow this?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.727
(clears throat)

05:59.760 --> 06:01.429
HIGGINS:
Hey.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.130
It was a joke.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.065
Mm. Lucky you're hilarious.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.000
GIBBS:
Run it forward.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.002
BISHOP:
Look. Is that a woman?

06:13.541 --> 06:14.808
Turn it up.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.976
Camera was too far away.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.645
BISHOP: Was this
a booty call?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.779
TORRES:
You know,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.047
I could almost forgive that.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.783
SPORTELLI:
Who is she?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.652
Where'd they go?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.521
Run it back.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.523
Right there.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.559
She left a print.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.061
I'll be damned.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.096
Don't worry about it.
We'll run it.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.112
You know, I could, um,

06:52.145 --> 06:54.682
text you if I
get a match, or...
SPORTELLI:
I'll wait.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.750
There was a good reason
Higgins left that stakeout.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.186
I like a boss that sticks up
for his people.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.621
(light chuckle)

07:01.955 --> 07:03.824
That was quick.
Yeah.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.958
Print was in the system.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.160
Courtesy of Metro
Police Department.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.462
Why?

07:08.496 --> 07:09.897
Who's our mystery woman?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.132
ABBY: Metro Police Detective
Michelle Lane.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.067
No.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.072
That's impossible.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.141
Well, seems like a pretty
good reason to walk away.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.209
Higgins met another cop.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.644
Michelle Lane is dead.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.147
What?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.652
She was killed
ten years ago.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.686
(computer keys click)

07:33.153 --> 07:35.656
Detective Higgins
met a ghost.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.666
BISHOP: Metro Detective
Michelle Lane,

07:45.699 --> 07:48.869
single, with no family,
was killed in 2007

07:48.902 --> 07:50.538
while working undercover.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.272
She was part of
an operation to take down

07:52.305 --> 07:53.807
arms dealer
Benjamin Sitano.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.576
That guy sold more than guns.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.110
Drugs, money, people.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.245
Sitano's criminal empire
was diverse,

07:58.278 --> 08:00.113
but Metro could never
make a case.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.282
Yeah. Lane had been undercover
for three months

08:02.315 --> 08:04.885
before tracking a gun deal
to Pershing Marina.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.621
Worth $2 million
in bearer bonds.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.556
But the bust never happened.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.057
Lane was on board.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.892
BISHOP: Yeah, a
witness at the marina

08:11.925 --> 08:14.728
saw Lane on deck
minutes before the explosion.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.063
You got a cause?
McGEE: Bomb.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.632
Metro investigation
confirmed it was the work

08:18.666 --> 08:19.633
of a rival gunrunner.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.834
Lane was just in
the wrong place

08:20.868 --> 08:21.769
at the wrong time.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.537
Body was never recovered

08:23.571 --> 08:26.073
and Lane was eventually
declared dead.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.641
SPORTELLI:
Because she is dead.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.612
I just got my ass handed to me
from Metro Command.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.146
Somebody's messing with us,
Gibbs.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.182
Whoa. What do you mean, "us"?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.950
Joint investigation.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.619
My captain and your director

08:38.652 --> 08:39.920
signed off on it.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.288
Not my first choice,

08:41.321 --> 08:42.956
but they want extra resources.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.826
Higgins is being treated
as an officer in distress.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.094
His cell phone?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.996
Turned off or destroyed.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.998
And I have detectives
waiting at his apartment.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.667
So far, the only one to show up
has been Agent Torres.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.636
Higgins was his partner.
Yeah.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.738
And my responsibility.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.740
We got this.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.276
I lost Lane ten years ago;
I'm not losing another cop.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.912
BISHOP:
According to your files,

09:04.945 --> 09:07.615
the bearer bonds
were never found.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.617
Look, I know where
you're going with this.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.753
Missing money, missing body.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.755
And now we get
a complete fingerprint match

09:14.788 --> 09:16.590
on three fingers?

09:16.624 --> 09:21.762
Maybe Lane survived the blast,
stole the bonds, skipped town.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.898
Agent Bishop, do you know
the people you work with?

09:24.932 --> 09:25.866
Agent Gibbs,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.267
McGee, Torres?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.637
I'd like to think so.
Would they steal

09:29.670 --> 09:30.938
two million bucks and let you
think they were dead?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.105
No.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.607
Well, I knew
Michelle Lane.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.108
She wasn't a crook.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.578
And she's not the woman
with Detective Higgins.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.286
TORRES:
Sportelli has a point.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.288
You don't think Lane could
have faked her own death?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.824
You know, undercover work is
usually a solo assignment,

09:50.858 --> 09:54.662
but you can only do it if people
on the outside have your back.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.930
They don't desert you,
you don't desert them. Period.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.633
Even for $2 million in
untraceable bearer bonds?

09:59.667 --> 10:00.968
No.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.402
Hmm. Well, did you
find anything

10:02.435 --> 10:03.971
at Higgins' apartment?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.305
I heard Metro
kicked you out.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.307
Yeah, they kicked me out,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.142
but not before
I got a few pictures.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.011
And here's what I think.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.412
There was definitely

10:12.445 --> 10:14.648
somebody there
this morning.
Fresh cat food.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.983
Yeah. I started talking
to the neighbors,

10:16.016 --> 10:17.651
and I caught up with one
that was coming back

10:17.685 --> 10:18.652
from a hot yoga class.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.419
Ah, was she cute?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.854
He was wearing leggings

10:20.888 --> 10:22.690
and was very sweaty.
Hmm.

10:22.723 --> 10:26.159
But he did see Higgins get
into a tan SUV with a woman.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.929
Our mystery woman.
Yeah. He didn't see
the license plate,

10:28.962 --> 10:30.731
but he saw a
bumper sticker.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.700
Is that a flower?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.367
Of course it's a flower.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.435
I'm just saying.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.637
TORRES:
Come on, man.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.212
DUCKY: Does anyone know
the average amount

10:45.245 --> 10:47.380
of cargo space
in the human torso?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.949
(Scottish accent):
Uh, 45 liters.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.684
Give or take.
Very good.

10:50.718 --> 10:55.088
Just big enough
to fit the identifiable parts

10:55.122 --> 10:57.290
of a second body.
(crowd gasping)

10:57.324 --> 10:59.426
Barely leaving enough room

10:59.459 --> 11:03.263
for the killer to re-stitch
the Y-incision,

11:03.296 --> 11:08.068
but effectively disposing
of his female murder victim.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.070
The old Body-in-a-Body gag?
(laughs)

11:10.103 --> 11:11.371
(chuckles):
Yes.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.441
It was the, uh,
teal nail varnish

11:14.474 --> 11:16.143
that gave me quite a start.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.811
But I'm-I'm glad
you bring that up,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.881
because this case
should not be known

11:20.914 --> 11:23.283
as the actions
of a deranged killer,

11:23.316 --> 11:27.454
but rather a simple lesson
in forensic pathology.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.824
Know who is on your table
and talk to them.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.260
While they're
on the slab, Doctor?

11:33.293 --> 11:35.829
Oh, that's where
they reveal their secrets.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.967
Yes, it's a subtle way
of discovering any foul play.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.836
Marine Colonel Stanley Metzger.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.472
50s. Suffered
a fatal heart attack.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.175
Yeah, this was soon after he
had made considerable effort

11:48.208 --> 11:49.743
to lose weight.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.779
His arms, legs and face,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.915
everywhere was covered
with loose skin--

11:54.948 --> 11:57.084
except his abdomen.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.852
Now, this was odd.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.387
So I weighed him.

12:00.420 --> 12:05.258
Despite major fat loss since
his last physical examination,

12:05.292 --> 12:09.029
he had gained 17 pounds.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.866
"How is this possible, Colonel?"

12:12.900 --> 12:14.334
I asked him.
(laughter)

12:14.367 --> 12:16.203
"Hmm?"

12:16.236 --> 12:18.806
He suggested I perform
a second autopsy,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.207
which I did.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.409
And...

12:22.442 --> 12:26.313
the female victim was found.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.783
If you listen...

12:29.817 --> 12:32.052
the dead will speak.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.459
(chuckles):
Oh.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.064
I seem to have gone

12:44.097 --> 12:46.133
well over my allotted time,
but if there are

12:46.166 --> 12:48.035
any questions...

12:48.068 --> 12:49.236
(crowd murmuring)

12:51.171 --> 12:53.907
Oh, my goodness.
Uh...

12:53.941 --> 12:56.810
(Scottish accent): Yeah,
well, who's going to be first?

12:56.844 --> 12:59.346
McGEE:
Do you know that this month
is the 500-year anniversary

12:59.379 --> 13:00.881
of the Protestant Reformation?

13:00.914 --> 13:02.816
Congratulations.
But I'm a Catholic.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.818
No. Talking about
the bumper sticker.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.353
The flower and heart--
it's a Luther rose.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.822
I'm thinking our mystery woman
may be a Lutheran.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.557
Sportelli sent over
Higgins' file,

13:10.590 --> 13:11.992
including his user name
and password

13:12.025 --> 13:14.227
for Metro's
internal file system.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.830
So we'll know if he logs in.
Well, hard to do
if this mystery woman

13:16.864 --> 13:18.365
tied him up in a trunk or a...

13:18.398 --> 13:19.232
sex dungeon.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.800
Well, then how do you
explain this?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.238
McGEE:
Higgins is logged in right now.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.373
From where?
BISHOP: If he's connected

13:26.406 --> 13:28.876
to Wi-Fi...
We can get a location.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.580
(computer beeping)

13:35.348 --> 13:36.917
(computer ringing)

13:36.950 --> 13:38.585
(exhales)

13:38.618 --> 13:41.154
Mom, you're online.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.890
Your phone keeps going
to voice mail.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.092
(groans) I'm sorry, buddy.
I've been...

13:45.125 --> 13:47.360
It's been a long morning.
(chuckles)

13:47.394 --> 13:48.361
Are you okay?

13:48.395 --> 13:49.629
Yeah. I'm fine.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.398
Everything okay
with you and Dad?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.600
No.
Why? What's wrong?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.970
My history project is due
in two days, and you went

13:57.004 --> 13:58.972
to some conference
in Washington, D.C.
I'm sorry.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.441
I'll finish sewing your Mark
Twain costume when I get back.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.876
I got to go, baby.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.077
Thanks.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.112
I love you.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.346
Love you, too.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.920
(exhales)

14:17.690 --> 14:19.526
McGEE: All right,
the I.P. address was assigned

14:19.559 --> 14:20.527
by a Wi-Fi router
on the lower level.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.362
Yeah, how do you want
to handle this, McGee?

14:22.395 --> 14:23.997
Well, I think that we...
Sounds good.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.999
Torres, you're with me.
Let's move.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.035
You had to call Metro,
didn't you?

14:30.637 --> 14:32.940
*

14:42.950 --> 14:44.651
(barking, snarling)

14:44.684 --> 14:47.087
Didn't even crack a window.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.998
Heads up. Tan SUV.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.971
That's got to be
our Lutheran.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.981
Metro Police!

15:14.014 --> 15:15.448
No, Federal agents!

15:15.482 --> 15:18.051
Let me see your hands!

15:22.255 --> 15:24.291
TORRES:
Guys, we got a body.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.659
It's Higgins.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.741
You change your mind
about joint investigations?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.410
Hell no.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.745
And I'm still not convinced
Michelle Lane is the killer.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.281
Or our mystery woman.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.649
(elevator bell dings)

15:49.682 --> 15:52.119
Let's just
find her, okay?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.120
(elevator bell dings)

15:53.153 --> 15:55.622
(sighs):
Yeah.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.158
Ever wish you weren't
the boss, Gibbs?

15:58.191 --> 16:01.028
I thought I was getting
a promotion.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.996
Instead, I got
everyone else's problems.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.331
Our job's to fix 'em.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.033
Exactly.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.734
But what if we can't?

16:09.336 --> 16:12.272
Retirement?

16:12.305 --> 16:15.075
Guys like us can't retire.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.779
Dude, just tell me
what you know.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.449
I want to help you, Nick,
but you know the rules

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
about waiting for
final autopsy results.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.752
Palmer. Go.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.120
He won't tell us anything.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.688
That is not what I said.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.558
I said Dr. Mallard has rules,
and I can't break them.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.294
Unless you...

16:34.327 --> 16:36.329
order me to
break them.
Doctor, go.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.032
The bullet entered the neck
and appears to have severed

16:39.066 --> 16:41.134
the spinal cord,
making death instant.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.536
From the angle of entry, I
would say that the shooter was

16:43.570 --> 16:44.704
above the body.
Distance?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.139
I'll need to complete
the autopsy first.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.640
Distance.
Actually,
on this point,

16:47.674 --> 16:49.809
I'm not just deferring
to Dr. Mallard's instructions.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.744
I need more information
for that answer.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.012
Time of death.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.383
About two hours before the body
was discovered in the garage.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.052
Just after the neighbor saw the
woman and Higgins drive away.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.588
Also, while there was
no gunshot residue on the body,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.556
there was glass
from the passenger window

17:03.590 --> 17:05.725
found in the wound.
Shot came while
they were driving.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.727
We're looking
for a third party.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.629
I'll report
to my captain.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.797
A-Again, this is all

17:10.830 --> 17:12.565
under the guise
of supposition...

17:12.599 --> 17:14.801
GIBBS: Get these supplies
put away!

17:14.834 --> 17:17.104
Dr. Mallard wouldn't like that!
(supplies clattering)

17:17.137 --> 17:18.371
(sighs)

17:19.339 --> 17:21.574
Yo. What's the big deal, man?

17:21.608 --> 17:24.577
Nick, I can fill out reports,
I can autopsy bodies,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.114
I am certified in all areas
of medical examination,

17:27.147 --> 17:31.584
but no one other than Dr.
Mallard restocks that closet.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.121
Did you ever find the rest
of the second body, the woman?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.789
Uh, what did the family say?
Must've been quite the scandal.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.759
These are not medical questions.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.130
My job as a pathologist is only

17:43.163 --> 17:44.764
to report
the medical findings.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.633
Well, who was responsible for
the broken chain of evidence?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.768
Yes. When did the killer
have a chance

17:48.801 --> 17:51.371
to remove the bag of guts
and add the poor lass?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.405
I mean, how long

17:52.439 --> 17:54.607
do you think that took?

17:54.641 --> 17:55.775
Was the killer
working alone?

17:55.808 --> 17:57.144
Excuse me, Doctor.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.379
I hate to interrupt.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.148
But you have an
urgent phone call.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.217
Uh, excuse me.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.524
Dr. Darwin.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.526
Yeah, I don't see

18:13.560 --> 18:16.163
a phone in here.
(chuckles)

18:16.196 --> 18:18.431
Gullstrand '25 calling.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.200
It's a single malt.
(chuckles)

18:20.233 --> 18:21.801
(laughs)
You looked thirsty.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.370
It's good to see you, Cadence.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.604
And you, Donald.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.273
When I heard you
were being honored,

18:26.306 --> 18:27.874
I knew I just
couldn't miss it.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.577
I mean, all the way from
New York just for me.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.145
Oh, and the whiskey.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.646
And why not?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.883
For the fifth--
or is it the sixth time?--

18:36.916 --> 18:39.219
(chuckles)
I have a job.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.753
Can't a girl support
a fellow alumnus

18:40.787 --> 18:42.922
without accusations
of being a headhunter?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.924
Ah, speaking of headhunters...

18:44.957 --> 18:46.293
Dr. Mallard?
(doorknob rattles)

18:46.326 --> 18:48.295
Are you in there?
(knocking)

18:48.328 --> 18:50.330
Well, it's your own fault for
presenting such a unique case.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.664
Well...
FIONA: Dr. Mallard?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.500
Has there ever been
another Body-in-a-Body?

18:53.533 --> 18:57.204
Yeah, well, now's
not the time to find out.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.207
FIONA:
Dr. Mallard? You promised you'd
let me take a selfie with you.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.209
(knocking)

19:04.244 --> 19:05.678
Anything on Lane's SUV?

19:05.712 --> 19:06.913
Nothing to I.D. our cop killer.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.716
No, but the car itself is
registered to a Jessica Pottorf

19:09.749 --> 19:11.751
of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.953
Well, and her laptop was hidden
underneath the seat.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.256
Abby just cracked
the hard drive and sent a link.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.192
That mother looks familiar.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.660
Michelle Lane
and Jessica Pottorf

19:20.693 --> 19:21.828
are the same person.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.396
BISHOP:
Living under an alias.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.233
And she married Craig Pottorf
in '08; they have a son,

19:26.266 --> 19:27.567
Landon, who's nine years old.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.935
She started a whole new life.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.337
What's she doing back in D.C.?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.239
Yeah, with her old
partner's dead body.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.874
Thinking it has something to do
with the 2007 case.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.943
She used Higgins' log-in
to look at old police files,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.945
specifically the arms dealer
she was trying to bust,

19:38.978 --> 19:39.879
Benjamin Sitano.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.881
Except he died
two years ago.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.384
Well, somebody had to inherit
the family business.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.619
McGEE: Well, they did.
His son, Benny Jr.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.555
He's supposedly gone legit
by starting

19:48.588 --> 19:51.691
a check-cashing franchise
called Check 'N Cash 4U.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.959
Super legit.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.627
The last Web page
Lane visited was

19:54.661 --> 19:56.396
the address of
Benny's corporate office.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.297
Bishop, Torres, let's go.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.599
Boss, you want me
to update Sportelli?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.933
About what?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.772
BENNY: So you think this woman's
coming here to hurt me?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.375
Oh, we don't
know that yet.
Well, I appreciate the concern,

20:08.408 --> 20:10.943
but that's why I have Nitro--
who also makes a mean espresso,

20:10.977 --> 20:13.246
by the way,
if either of you are interested.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.914
Yeah? She'll take
one of those.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.716
Sure.
Nitro?

20:16.749 --> 20:19.286
NITRO:
Sure thing, Benny.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.422
Please.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.726
Yeah, Nitro and I go way back.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.995
People come to hurt you a lot?
Not exactly,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.663
but fearing
for your personal safety

20:30.697 --> 20:33.266
is the sad reality
of being born with my name.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.302
And your father's
criminal empire.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.303
Alleged.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.670
But yes.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.906
After he passed,
I got us out of that life.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.041
With shady payroll advances.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.311
So we're not giving puppies
to orphans.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.513
You were arrested last month
for money laundering.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.014
Dad had long tentacles

20:48.047 --> 20:49.882
that keep growing back.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.385
And if it's not the FBI,
it's the ATF or DEA,

20:52.419 --> 20:55.922
and I'm pretty sure the IRS
is about to arrest me!

20:55.955 --> 20:57.324
(chuckles):
Huh?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.057
I have no knowledge

20:58.090 --> 20:59.692
or involvement.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.594
But somehow
the buck always seems

21:01.628 --> 21:03.062
to stop here.
I was ecstatic

21:03.095 --> 21:04.897
when this meeting
wasn't about the past.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.333
Oh, yeah, it is.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.406
You recognize her.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.874
She used to work for my father.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.076
That had to be
ten years ago.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.778
Did you know she was a cop?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.947
Not till I read about it
in the papers.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.082
She died in that
boat explosion.
Nope.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.051
She was the woman
in that first photo,

21:25.084 --> 21:26.586
the one who was
coming here for you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.721
What? Why?

21:28.755 --> 21:30.457
Well, you tell us.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.525
BENNY: I have no idea.
Thanks, Nitro.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.093
Fresh cinnamon?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.862
Uh, no, thank you.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.397
Benny, where were you
yesterday morning?

21:40.099 --> 21:42.469
Now, I know I said
I'm used to questions,

21:42.502 --> 21:44.937
but I think this one's
gonna require a lawyer.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.841
(phone rings)

21:48.875 --> 21:51.043
Yeah, go, Torres.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.679
Our ghost just walked in.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.680
Stay with her.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.747
On it.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.832
(elevator bell dings)

22:14.401 --> 22:15.868
NCIS.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.979
(door closes)

22:27.013 --> 22:29.015
You're supposed to be dead.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.984
But you ran away.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.686
From your job.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.688
Your sworn duty.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.689
Why?

22:36.723 --> 22:38.558
I mean, besides the $2 million.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.427
I'm not here about the past.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.128
I came back
because I'm in trouble.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.530
Oh, what gave it away,
your handcuffs?

22:43.563 --> 22:46.399
Whoever killed Higgins
is after me.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.000
Why?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.636
Someone found out who I am.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.071
I got a call three days ago
from an unknown number.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.773
A voice threatened my family

22:53.806 --> 22:55.675
unless I handed over
the bearer bonds.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.109
The hazards
of stealing dirty money.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.178
Guess you're gonna
have to give it back, huh?

22:59.211 --> 23:01.748
I don't have the money.
That's the problem.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.750
And this is my family
we're talking about.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.918
This voice call back?
They said they would.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.588
So I called the only cop
I could trust: my old partner.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.022
Yeah.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.991
Quite a shock for him.
He was on stakeout

23:12.024 --> 23:13.493
and said he'd meet me
the next day.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.161
I couldn't wait that long,
so I went there.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.529
That's why he was
so anxious.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.964
I told him about the blackmail.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.799
It must be connected
to the undercover case.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.934
So we went back to his apartment
to pull the files.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.870
As we were leaving,
someone shot at us.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.071
Mm-hmm. Get a look?

23:27.574 --> 23:32.512
A good... man
got killed trying to help me.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.647
But if I'd stopped,
I'd be just as dead.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.450
I had to find out
who was behind this.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.151
You think it was Benny.
I was going there
to explain

23:39.185 --> 23:42.154
that I never had
his bearer bonds, and to beg

23:42.188 --> 23:43.523
for the safety of my family.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.857
What other choice did I have?

23:44.891 --> 23:46.859
The same choice you had
ten years ago.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.194
Come clean.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.497
Go to the cops.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.098
(knock on door)

23:56.503 --> 23:57.704
McGEE:
Boss, sorry to interrupt.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.606
We turned on
Lane's cell phone

23:59.639 --> 24:01.708
to process it--
hasn't stopped ringing.
("Charge" ringtone playing)

24:01.741 --> 24:04.076
That's Landon's ringtone.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.578
Please let me answer it.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.514
Let me tell my son
everything's okay.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.982
("Charge" ringtone
continues playing)

24:11.551 --> 24:12.552
(phone beeps)

24:14.521 --> 24:16.088
Hey, bud.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.590
Landon?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.258
Landon, are you there?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.193
(muffled screaming)

24:21.227 --> 24:23.229
Landon!

24:23.262 --> 24:25.732
DISTORTED VOICE: Turn over the
bonds, you get your kid back.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.534
(muffled screams)
Landon!

24:27.567 --> 24:30.469
(gasping)
Oh, my God.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.080
McGee.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.650
Metro sent detectives
to Lane's house in Harrisburg.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.752
Yeah? And?
Well, it appears
a lone intruder

24:45.785 --> 24:47.520
broke into the house
and knocked out the husband.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.521
He's in the hospital,

24:48.555 --> 24:49.956
but he'll be okay.
Landon.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.791
Phone's turned off,
but nothing at the scene

24:51.824 --> 24:53.259
suggests that he was hurt.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.861
Gibbs.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.663
Why the hell
didn't you call me

24:56.696 --> 24:58.264
as soon as you had
Lane in custody?

24:58.297 --> 25:00.700
There's people with questions,
including me.

25:00.733 --> 25:01.868
Questions about the case?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.002
Eventually.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.537
Don't make this personal.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.972
It's hard not to.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.807
We got a missing kid.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.542
Priority is getting him back.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.978
I'm not sitting
on my hands, Gibbs.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.580
We're taking this.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.048
You got questions...

25:16.082 --> 25:18.284
write 'em down.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.687
He has every right
to be angry,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.622
but it doesn't help
get my son back.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.190
I didn't leave
for the money.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.559
Then why?

25:30.697 --> 25:35.668
All I care about
is finding my son.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.604
Then why the hell aren't you
telling us everything?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.606
(sighs)

25:42.709 --> 25:45.111
While I was undercover,
I found out I was pregnant.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.646
With Landon?

25:46.679 --> 25:47.513
It was unexpected,

25:47.546 --> 25:50.750
and the father
wasn't in the picture.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.619
Talk about
reevaluating your life

25:52.652 --> 25:53.620
on the fly.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.622
The bust at the marina
was supposed to happen

25:55.655 --> 25:56.623
the next day.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.325
A witness saw you on that boat.
Until I realized

25:59.358 --> 26:00.893
that my wire had
run out of battery.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.629
Metro needed the deal on tape,

26:02.662 --> 26:05.798
so I snuck back to my car,
when boom.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.600
That explosion
was meant for me,

26:07.634 --> 26:08.968
and I got the hell out.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.603
It was a rival gun dealer.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.138
News didn't report that
for months.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.372
At the time,

26:13.405 --> 26:15.708
I thought maybe
there was a mole.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.043
Who would you trust,
Agent Torres?

26:18.811 --> 26:20.613
Where did you go?

26:20.647 --> 26:22.014
I checked in to
a crappy motel in Delaware

26:22.048 --> 26:24.751
to lay low and reflect
on my future,

26:24.784 --> 26:27.353
as a cop...

26:27.386 --> 26:30.022
(voice breaks):
and as a mother.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.792
I hoped that by the time
I had my answer,

26:32.825 --> 26:34.627
I'd know what to do.

26:34.661 --> 26:38.765
Then, a week later,
a new option was handed to me.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.400
I saw on the news that I died.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.636
I took it as a sign.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.804
Did you also take the bonds?

26:46.773 --> 26:49.709
For all I know,
they drifted out to sea.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.711
This wasn't
about money.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.346
This was about
a good life for my son.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.883
That really require being dead?

26:56.916 --> 27:00.286
I knew I was lying
to my friends, teammates.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.754
We trusted each other.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.222
Then why not go back to them?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.257
He...

27:07.259 --> 27:08.795
It was complicated.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.263
The biological father?

27:12.832 --> 27:15.634
I never told him he had a child.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.106
The Pottorfs own a modest house,
a modest car.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.442
They saved their money to go
to Epcot Center in January.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.444
Low season-- it's
a good time to go.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.315
Their cable package
has no premium channels.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.218
I mean, if they had
the bearer bonds,

27:32.251 --> 27:34.754
there is no evidence of it.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.823
I guess Lane was
telling the truth.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.157
ABBY: With the help
of a fake I.D.,

27:38.190 --> 27:39.992
she started taking
night classes,

27:40.026 --> 27:41.794
she got a job as a teacher

27:41.828 --> 27:44.030
at a Lutheran preschool,
and she got married.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.033
It's like she built
an entire new life

27:47.066 --> 27:48.167
from scratch.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.468
Well, blackmailer
thinks otherwise.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.436
Anything to help us find them?

27:50.469 --> 27:54.741
No. But I think I know
how they found her.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.209
Guess what else the Pottorfs
spent their money on.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.978
They had season tickets

27:59.011 --> 28:01.080
to the Lancaster Barnstormers.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.181
McGEE:
Doesn't ring a bell.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.216
Didn't you see
the famous viral video

28:04.250 --> 28:06.819
from last month?
No.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.354
Okay, watch this.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.723
Okay, so this guy
catches it, right?

28:10.757 --> 28:12.892
And then he proposes
with a foul ball.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.493
Did he have this planned?
ABBY: No.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.162
That's what makes it
so romantic.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.265
It got 44 million hits.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.868
It was on every news
broadcast in the country.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.771
Mostly because
the girlfriend said no.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.739
Uh, maybe if he'd caught
a home run.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.875
Okay, but here's why
I took another look.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.812
Her season tickets
were in the same section.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.246
That's Lane and her son.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.782
You think
the kidnapper saw this?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.784
Yeah.
And check out her T-shirt.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.786
It's got the name
of where she works.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.187
BISHOP:
Hey.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.823
Uh, where's Gibbs?
Why? What's going on?

28:43.856 --> 28:44.957
I think Lane just
cracked the case.

28:50.496 --> 28:54.133
Well, some things
never change--

28:54.166 --> 28:58.270
my nursing a hangover
while you study.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.873
You were right,
last night.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.975
Yeah, Body-in-a-Body.

29:03.009 --> 29:06.212
Apparently, it never
happened before or since.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.346
You checked.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.515
Yeah, online
and in these books.

29:09.548 --> 29:12.819
The only recorded reference
of such a case

29:12.852 --> 29:14.520
appears to be in my notes.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.923
Hmm. Isn't that a shame?

29:16.956 --> 29:19.792
So, save for your lecture,
the world would never have

29:19.826 --> 29:20.860
such a valuable resource?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.862
Ah...
(chuckles)

29:22.895 --> 29:23.863
The other shoe drops.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.064
I knew it.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.000
You a here to sell me
on a teaching position.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.537
John Jay is the world's premier
college of criminal justice.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.506
Spoken while standing in
the halls of our alma mater.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.542
You have quite a nerve.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.311
Besides, you're wrong.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.579
It's not a
full-time position.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.881
Just a residency for a semester.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.850
Which I must refuse.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.853
While you write
your book.

29:46.886 --> 29:50.356
Everything you've seen and done,
medical and otherwise.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.358
We both know your personal
experiences are invariably

29:52.391 --> 29:54.393
tied to your medical knowledge.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.828
It's the Ducky charm.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.197
(chuckles)
Flattery will get you nowhere.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.499
I haven't even started.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.001
Because I think

30:02.034 --> 30:03.870
it wouldn't just be your book.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.872
It could be the book.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.574
A definitive reference
for the entire field.

30:08.607 --> 30:12.411
Your story will inspire and
empower generations to come.

30:12.444 --> 30:16.015
I have responsibilities at NCIS.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.985
It's a semester in New York.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.287
And you can even stay
with me, if you like.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.255
I do live alone.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.258
It would be a frightful burden
on Dr. Palmer.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.594
How many times have you talked
to him since you've been away?

30:28.627 --> 30:31.563
I always call him
once a day when I travel.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.899
Sometimes more.

30:32.932 --> 30:33.933
Have you?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.134
On this trip?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.435
Ah. Touché.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.970
You've been here,

30:38.004 --> 30:40.006
and yet the world of NCIS turns.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.341
Without me.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.642
Because of you.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.312
Because of the legacy
you've put in place.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.886
It's time to spread the wealth.

31:01.660 --> 31:05.031
BENNY: I'm busting my ass
to get away from that life.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.665
Why would I kill a cop?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.500
Same reason
you'd kidnap Landon.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.003
What? I didn't kidnap anyone!

31:11.037 --> 31:13.139
He's not just anyone.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.607
Your son.

31:17.276 --> 31:20.379
Michelle told us.
Michelle?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.349
She's here?

31:23.382 --> 31:25.918
She didn't just find out
she was pregnant.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.020
You two had an affair
while she was undercover.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.388
That's why she ran away.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.057
BISHOP:
You couldn't return to Metro.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.559
Everyone can count backward
nine months.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.928
Word would have spread
to the Sitano family.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.529
McGEE: You found out
that she was still alive,

31:37.563 --> 31:38.597
so you blackmailed her,

31:38.630 --> 31:41.000
and you took her son--
your son.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.434
Heir to the family.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.436
That's exactly why
I let them go.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.072
So you did find out.
Yes!

31:46.105 --> 31:48.941
But that was nine years ago.
All right?

31:48.975 --> 31:50.342
Right after she had the baby.

31:50.376 --> 31:53.479
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Back up.

31:53.512 --> 31:57.283
Michelle and I had
a relationship.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.486
After the explosion,
I was devastated.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.688
But, in my father's
line of work,

32:02.721 --> 32:04.991
until you see a body,
nobody's dead.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.959
So I hired a P.I.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.360
You were angry.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.029
I was in love.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.430
The P.I. found Michelle

32:11.463 --> 32:15.434
maybe 18 months later,
with a new name, a new man

32:15.467 --> 32:19.605
and a new baby-- a son.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.473
My son.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.042
You wanted them back.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.476
Till I realized
the truth.

32:27.013 --> 32:30.382
A new life was the best thing
that could happen to my kid.

32:30.416 --> 32:33.019
'Cause whether it's the cops
looking to arrest me

32:33.052 --> 32:34.620
or scumbags looking for money,

32:34.653 --> 32:37.089
my life will always
be tied to crime.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.991
That's no way to live.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.629
So I decided to let them be.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.734
Tried to forget about it.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.569
Is he telling the truth?

32:50.602 --> 32:53.705
Who else knew
about the missing bonds?

32:53.739 --> 32:56.108
Who else would
take Landon?

32:56.142 --> 32:58.144
(sighs):
Oh, God.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.612
Someone has my little boy.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.115
We'll find him.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.151
Trust us.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.488
You don't have to do this.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.757
It's not my call anymore.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.695
Michelle.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.665
Danny.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.800
I'm sorry about your son.
Thank you.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.104
And I'm sorry about this.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.173
Does Gibbs know?

33:27.206 --> 33:28.607
He knows it's the law.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.509
Letting people think you're dead
isn't illegal.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.810
Technically.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.679
It requires breaking laws
along the way,

33:33.712 --> 33:35.614
and she has to answer for it.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.249
(handcuffs clicking)

33:37.283 --> 33:39.351
Michelle Lane...

33:39.385 --> 33:42.221
you're under arrest
for conspiracy and fraud.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.223
Do I need to read your rights?

33:44.256 --> 33:46.692
No. You need
to find my son.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.395
I have sins to atone for--
fine-- but he's innocent.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.097
Stop wasting time.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.030
Let's go.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.233
MICHELLE: This is doing
everything you can?

33:54.266 --> 33:56.135
This is trusting you?!

33:56.168 --> 33:58.070
You said you'd find him!

34:07.146 --> 34:09.381
Ah, Gibbs. Hold on.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.150
I know we're
running out of time

34:11.183 --> 34:13.319
and we've got no leads
on Landon...

34:13.352 --> 34:15.221
Bishop, I'm waiting
for some good news.

34:15.254 --> 34:18.690
Well, we all agree that Benny
has the clearest motive.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.492
Yeah. Son and money.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.161
But we've got
nothing on him.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.529
Benny's got a record--

34:23.562 --> 34:25.364
he doesn't want to get
his hands dirty.

34:25.397 --> 34:30.169
So what if he paid someone,
someone he goes way back with?

34:30.202 --> 34:32.104
Bodyguard?

34:32.138 --> 34:34.240
Omar Nitro.
I asked the IRS agents

34:34.273 --> 34:36.242
from Benny's office to send over
the payroll records.

34:37.343 --> 34:39.245
Nitro's salary just tripled.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.247
Lot of money for a bodyguard.
Let's bring him in.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.315
He's just gonna call Benny
and lawyer up.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.317
Maybe we set up
a friendly meeting.

34:45.351 --> 34:46.485
Catch flies with honey.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.854
I was gonna say French fries.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.160
Omar. Hey.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.295
Uh, Agent Bishop
and Torres.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.231
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.133
Mm-hmm.
Ah, you're eating
plain chicken

35:01.167 --> 35:03.602
at a place that serves
fried Twinkies?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.471
(chuckles)
You got to set a good example.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.307
(chuckles): For the...
the Tuesday lunch crowd?

35:08.340 --> 35:09.575
No. Potential clients.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.642
Ah.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.911
I'm also a personal trainer.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.182
I just finished my classes
and got my diploma.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.450
Which is why my salary tripled.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.321
That is why you're
really here, right?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.323
To get me to confess?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.593
I used to be a cop.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.328
We know.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.196
With Metro.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.297
Before you were fired.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.233
So, were you crooked...

35:34.266 --> 35:36.368
or just bad at your job?

35:36.402 --> 35:38.337
Past is the past.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.439
I am now Mr. Sitano's guard,

35:40.472 --> 35:42.574
personal trainer
and licensed masseur.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.677
He did not pay me
to take the kid. Are we done?

35:45.711 --> 35:47.679
No.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.415
I'm gonna call Metro.

35:49.448 --> 35:52.451
Do they know you have a
concealed carry license, Omar?

35:52.484 --> 35:55.921
I mean, those are pretty easy
to have revoked.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.289
Yeah, it's gonna be
really hard

35:57.323 --> 35:58.156
to guard someone
without a weapon.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.891
That's really gonna hurt
that paycheck.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.260
You guys are way off base here.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.628
Then enlighten us.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.566
I was pressured to
skim evidence, but I refused.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.934
They thought
I would turn snitch,

36:08.967 --> 36:10.402
so they railroaded me out, okay?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.238
When I went looking
for another job,

36:12.271 --> 36:13.171
Benny related.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.641
I was a good guy
trying to beat a bad rap.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.875
I am not crooked.

36:16.908 --> 36:20.612
So, then why didn't you tell
your boss about the dirty cops?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.614
'Cause my boss was one of them.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.617
And Sportelli is way too smart
to get caught.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.822
Did we find anything yet?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.458
Is this even possible?

36:32.491 --> 36:34.360
Sportelli and Lane
never showed up to booking.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.663
It's a 20-minute drive,
and they left hours ago.
There's no answer.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.398
Technically,
it doesn't prove anything.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.699
Yeah, but it doesn't
look good, either.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.401
Find him!

36:42.434 --> 36:44.470
We still have access
to Metro's files?

36:44.503 --> 36:46.338
You're right--
Higgins' log-in details.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.873
Where is he?
TORRES:
Well, he has to be close,

36:47.906 --> 36:49.808
because he's been playing us
this whole time.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.543
All right, listen to this.
Sportelli rents

36:51.577 --> 36:52.811
a one-bedroom in Chinatown.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.012
Apparently, he and a few buddies

36:54.045 --> 36:55.647
bought a local bar
and fell into debt.

36:55.681 --> 36:59.251
Sportelli used up
his entire 401(k).
Retirement.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.387
$2 million would be a fresh
start anywhere he wanted.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.355
What's the name of the bar?
McGEE:
It's called Flankman's.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.524
In Anacostia? That place
closed two years ago.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.893
Well, Sportelli
still pays property taxes.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.329
Means he's still got a key.
Let's go.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.534
Time is precious, Michelle.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.469
For all three of us.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.871
I told you,
I don't have the bonds.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.440
I never did!

37:21.473 --> 37:24.376
(panting)
What happened to you, Danny?

37:24.410 --> 37:26.378
Me? What happened to me?

37:26.412 --> 37:27.779
I'm the same.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.615
Same job, same life--

37:29.648 --> 37:31.383
just trying to make ends meet.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.784
You, on the other hand...

37:32.818 --> 37:34.486
I made a choice.
Yeah.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.822
Well, here's
another one.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.691
You went to Higgins
and forced my hand.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.328
And now I'm gonna
force yours.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.631
The money or your son!

37:45.664 --> 37:47.466
Just tell me where

37:47.499 --> 37:49.601
you stashed the bearer bonds,
and I'll disappear

37:49.635 --> 37:51.002
just like you.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.371
Please!

37:55.574 --> 37:56.942
Offshore account!

37:56.975 --> 37:58.410
Cayman Islands!

38:00.512 --> 38:02.047
Account number?

38:02.080 --> 38:04.049
457-9153-9...

38:04.082 --> 38:05.984
Slow down!
(whispers): Sorry, sorry.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.319
9153...?

38:07.353 --> 38:09.521
947-371.
947-37...

38:09.555 --> 38:11.523
That's 13 digits.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.559
Banks don't use 13 digits!

38:13.592 --> 38:14.960
No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

38:14.993 --> 38:16.362
It's from memory!
Please don't!

38:16.395 --> 38:17.262
Don't hurt my son!

38:17.295 --> 38:18.897
(sobbing): Please!
(dog barking outside)

38:18.930 --> 38:19.965
Damn it!

38:19.998 --> 38:21.567
(crying)

38:21.600 --> 38:23.569
McGEE:
Federal agents!

38:41.653 --> 38:43.355
GIBBS:
Sportelli!

38:43.389 --> 38:44.623
It's over.
SPORTELLI:
Yeah.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.492
Now what?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.460
BISHOP: Hang on.
Here we go.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.364
Landon, baby.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.366
Come on, sweetie.
Let's get them out of here.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.534
Good. Good.
(Michelle sobbing)

39:03.542 --> 39:04.776
It's up to you how this goes.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.578
You always were
a fair guy, Gibbs.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.447
TORRES:
I'd say more than fair.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.615
You killed a cop.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.016
One of your own.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.551
Our job to fix it.

39:12.584 --> 39:13.519
SPORTELLI:
I can't.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.687
Then take responsibility.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.492
(gun racks)

39:24.530 --> 39:26.532
(gunshot, body thuds)

39:33.672 --> 39:35.641
He made his choice.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.410
(sirens approaching)

39:38.444 --> 39:40.412
(elevator bell dings)

39:40.446 --> 39:42.147
Wait, so it was a lie?

39:42.180 --> 39:44.149
Lane didn't have
an offshore account?

39:44.182 --> 39:46.151
No, she was stalling.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.819
So where's the $2 million?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.154
Well, no idea.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.189
Could still be
at the bottom of that marina.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.725
Hey, McGee?
Huh?

39:53.759 --> 39:55.494
You know
how to scuba dive?

39:55.527 --> 39:56.828
No. You?

39:56.862 --> 39:59.698
No, but for $2 million,
I could learn.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.535
(doorbells jingle)

40:05.704 --> 40:07.005
Mm. Hey, Michelle.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.707
Hey, Landon.
Hey, Agent Bishop.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.008
Thank you, again,

40:10.041 --> 40:11.510
for everything.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.744
Metro says I still have

40:12.778 --> 40:15.013
a few things to answer for,
but that's okay.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.449
Uh, why did you want
to meet us here?

40:17.483 --> 40:21.553
Uh, well, I, uh,
I made that call for you.

40:23.689 --> 40:24.990
Hello, Benny.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.593
(sighs)
Michelle.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.561
Oh, this is unexpected.

40:29.595 --> 40:35.501
I... wanted to thank you
in person for understanding.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.768
Landon,

40:36.802 --> 40:38.604
this is Mr. Sitano.
Hello.

40:38.637 --> 40:39.971
BENNY:
Hey. It's, uh, Benny.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.840
It's nice to meet you, Landon.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.141
How do you know my mom?

40:43.174 --> 40:45.611
We're, uh...

40:45.644 --> 40:47.679
old friends.
BISHOP:
Why don't you guys

40:47.713 --> 40:48.780
have a seat?

40:48.814 --> 40:50.649
Thank you.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.489
*

41:03.995 --> 41:07.799
(door opens, closes)

41:07.833 --> 41:09.501
Hey, Duck.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.969
Welcome back.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.972
There a problem?

41:14.005 --> 41:16.575
Oh, the quarterly supplies
have been restocked.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.709
Mm-hmm.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.145
Just the way
I would have done it.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.981
Yeah. So, there a problem?

41:23.014 --> 41:24.983
(chuckles)
Well, that's the point.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.585
There is no problem.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.719
(laughs)

41:27.753 --> 41:29.921
Took you long enough
to figure that out.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.526
Cadence.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.764
Yeah?

41:38.797 --> 41:41.767
She already spoke with you.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.802
Last week.

41:43.835 --> 41:47.639
It seems everybody is
planning my life without me.

41:47.673 --> 41:48.774
No.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.742
Your choice all the way.

41:50.776 --> 41:54.646
It is just one semester.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.748
Yeah, you bet.

41:56.782 --> 42:00.151
New York is but a
three-hour train ride.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.987
I can visit.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.022
Yeah, you bet.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.092
Dr. Palmer...

42:07.125 --> 42:09.761
will make a wonderful
medical examiner.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.229
We'll see.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.131
I...
Stop, Duck.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.002
Is this what you want to do?

42:19.270 --> 42:20.972
Yes.

42:21.006 --> 42:23.975
Okay. Then it's not me
you need to talk to.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.912
Oh. My apologies.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.647
Am I interrupting?

42:28.680 --> 42:31.082
Nah, you're right on time, Doc.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.018
Really?

42:33.051 --> 42:35.153
That's unusual.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.188
