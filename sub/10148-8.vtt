01:20.081 --> 01:22.416
<i>The government's lame</i>

01:23.251 --> 01:26.045
<i>And my folks are insane, man</i>

01:27.797 --> 01:29.882
<i>Till they shut down your brain</i>

01:29.966 --> 01:33.261
<i>This life is all pain</i>

01:33.803 --> 01:35.596
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:35.680 --> 01:38.432
<i>At least the stuff on the tube
is emotional lube</i>

01:41.519 --> 01:46.607
<i>Yeah, but it brainwashes me
to consume all I see</i>

01:49.193 --> 01:50.193
<i>Yeah</i>

01:51.862 --> 01:53.614
<i>Consume, losers!</i>

01:57.910 --> 02:00.121
Donny! Donny! Donny!

02:00.621 --> 02:03.332
Donny! Donny! Donny!

02:03.416 --> 02:06.002
Donny! Donny! Donny!

02:12.466 --> 02:13.968
Wicked set, Donny.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.429
Donny! Donny! Donny!

02:16.512 --> 02:18.889
Donny, please give me your autograph.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.183
You can sign me anywhere you want.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.896
Killer show, Donny. You hear that crowd?

02:25.980 --> 02:27.898
They love you.
Here, sign these contracts.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.109
The two label execs
were literally fighting over

02:30.192 --> 02:31.027
who got to sign you.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.904
And that was before they heard
your new disc went deca-plat.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.040
Hi, Donny.

02:51.005 --> 02:51.839
Huh?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.257
What? No.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.106
<i>Rise and shine, Donny.
Time to pay the Piper.</i>

03:09.315 --> 03:13.444
Please, put me back in.
It hurts out here. Please!

03:13.944 --> 03:17.490
<i>Now, now. Love like that
doesn't</i> come <i>cheap.</i>

03:17.573 --> 03:20.409
<i>You want more, you know
what you have to do.</i>

03:24.205 --> 03:25.247
Rough night?

03:25.581 --> 03:26.624
Aren't they all?

03:31.045 --> 03:32.838
Maybe you need someone
out there with you.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.423
You could do worse, you know.

03:34.965 --> 03:35.965
Forget it.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.510
Why should you have all the fun?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.136
Max, it's not fun.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.680
What? Flying, intrigue, power?

03:41.847 --> 03:44.100
Yeah, you're right. It's a drag.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.357
Couple of creds?

03:54.318 --> 03:55.486
Spare some creds?

03:55.778 --> 03:57.446
<i>Get a 30's, Greg.</i>

04:08.332 --> 04:10.000
I tried asking nice!

04:14.296 --> 04:16.507
I got a problem. It's with Max.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.426
The girl? What?

04:19.510 --> 04:23.472
Well, she wants to get more involved.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.057
Over my dead body.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.685
<i>And if you think you're gonna
overrule me on this...</i>

04:27.768 --> 04:31.564
Will you relax? I feel the same way
you do, for once.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.351
But she's been a big help to me.
How do I tell her no?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.694
You're asking me for advice
on handling women?

04:36.902 --> 04:39.488
Ah. I see your point. One sec.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.162
I think that's Donny Grasso.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.121
<i>Who?</i>

04:47.204 --> 04:49.373
Kid from school,
ran away last week.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.459
Guess he didn't run far.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.214
Give back the bag.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.383
It doesn't go with your shoes.

04:59.675 --> 05:00.968
Get away from me.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.762
Wouldn't bother.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.930
I'm stronger than I look.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.602
What is he, nuts?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.486
[yelpingl

06:24.260 --> 06:26.971
That's all I could do.
Batman was after me.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.473
Please, hook me up again,
just... just for a little while.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.058
I promise I'll get more later.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.483
Yes, Donny, you will.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.529
Now come, your fans are waiting.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.009
I'm really glad you decided
to ask me out, Wendell.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.761
I didn't think managers
could date employees.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.307
We can't. I could lose
my promotion for this.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.393
But I couldn't help myself
any longer, Jessie.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.313
You're wonderful.
The way you pour the freezie cones,

07:17.396 --> 07:19.523
always with that beautiful smile.

07:19.857 --> 07:20.941
Jessie...

07:22.192 --> 07:23.192
Yes?

07:23.235 --> 07:26.155
They're making me central manager
for lower-mid-downtown.

07:26.322 --> 07:27.322
Yes?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.870
And I want you to marry me.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.914
Oh, Wendell.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.009
Wonderful.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.192
On your feet.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.778
I'll put you back in
once you run some errands.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.364
First, dump this mess across town.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.866
Then find me some new recruits.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.207
Most of them
have turned up in hospitals

08:18.290 --> 08:21.168
with overdose levels of serotonin
in their brains.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.253
They're comatose, but stable.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.630
And they were all runaways?

08:24.713 --> 08:27.424
That's why I thought of it
when you mentioned your friend Donny.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.176
Except he's not comatose.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.678
Not yet, anyway.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.024
Don't forget,

08:44.108 --> 08:46.652
I'm only bringing you 'cause you said
you know Donny's parents.

08:46.819 --> 08:48.278
So don't get any ideas.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.575
When you see how I handle this,

08:53.742 --> 08:55.369
you're gonna be beggin' me to help you.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.172
Hmm. The Grasses never were
big on home security.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.967
Mr. Grasso. Mrs. Grasso.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.888
Looks like they're not big
on cleaning, either.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.230
Donny's world.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.029
A used cred card.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.322
What do you want?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.116
Mrs. Grasso.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.830
- Who are you?
- I'm Max, Donny's friend.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.832
- You remember me, don't you?
- No.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.710
Donny ain't here, so get out.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.673
Wait.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.967
Have you seen Donny?

09:52.176 --> 09:53.616
Did he want something from his room?

09:53.886 --> 09:55.429
Quiet, Elaine. We don't care.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.680
Don, please.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.182
Get back in the kitchen.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.649
You know many times
the cops brought him home

10:07.733 --> 10:10.652
and told us we just had
to show me some more TLC?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.029
A lot they know!

10:12.321 --> 10:13.739
We tried everything with that kid.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.199
And now we're done trying.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.868
If you do know where he is,
tell him don't come back!

10:21.163 --> 10:22.456
Nothing like a visit to Donny's

10:22.539 --> 10:24.666
to make me appreciate
my own mom and dad.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.001
I know what you mean.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.088
Now let's see where
Donny was spending his creds.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.342
Vroom?

10:35.052 --> 10:36.136
VR Room.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.888
It's an arcade downtown.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.766
Donny was spending his creds
escaping reality.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.226
Can't imagine why.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.159
- Hover VR?
- Pretty schway. Huh?

10:59.618 --> 11:02.371
Total freedom of movement,
total sensory immersion.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.663
Latest gen.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.389
Think this is what's
frying kids' brains?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.627
Come on, Ter, if it was dangerous,
you think they'd let kids do it?

11:08.961 --> 11:10.796
Anyway, we're here
to investigate, aren't we?

11:10.879 --> 11:12.005
I'm here to investigate,

11:12.089 --> 11:13.799
you had your chance
with Donny's parents,

11:13.966 --> 11:14.966
and you blew it.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.010
Yeah, but I got us here, didn't I?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.722
Tell you what, I'll do some
background research.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.224
<i>On Doom Racer.</i>

11:42.160 --> 11:43.412
- Max?
- Kip.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.746
Haven't seen your face around.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.665
It's been behind a pair of VR specs.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.875
Here?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.377
Not likely. There's this new VR.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.296
Gives you the realest real ever.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.382
It feels like love all over you.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.260
- Yeah?
- I could take you, if you want.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.679
- Can I bring a friend?
- The more, the merrier.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.560
I think I got something.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.270
There's this new kind of VR.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.813
I made us an appointment.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.065
Great. Except there's no us.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.714
It's just me from here on, remember?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.110
Oh, come on, Terry.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.405
Do I detect reluctance?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.993
I'm telling you, it's too dangerous.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.163
Dangerous? It's just VR.
How could it be dangerous?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.623
Why don't you ask Donny?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.296
Look, if you don't wanna come,
just say so.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.798
Max doesn't need a chaperone, do you?

12:37.132 --> 12:39.426
Uh, no. I guess not.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.053
Then it's settled.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.387
Let's go.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.016
Max, I don't think this is a good idea.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.143
I'll call you later, Terry. I will.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.310
Max!

12:53.941 --> 12:55.701
You don't know
what you're missing, McGinnis.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.029
Yeah. Spellbinder hooks us up real good.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.112
Spellbinder?

13:00.572 --> 13:01.615
Hey!

13:38.944 --> 13:40.612
Where did they go? Where?

13:52.416 --> 13:54.376
Oh, you're home, Maxine.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
How was your particle physics
test today?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.714
- Another 100.
- That's our girl.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.716
Fixed your cycle for you, sweetheart.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.609
You shouldn't hear that rattle anymore.

14:02.843 --> 14:03.927
Thanks, Dad.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.932
Guys, there's gonna be
this ceremony at school this weekend.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.601
I'm being inducted
into a national honor society.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.688
I know it's tough, but it'd be great
if you could all make it.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.815
- Of course we'll be there.
- That's great.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.443
- Aren't you being silly?
- We're all so proud of you.

14:24.990 --> 14:28.201
To feel the love
you never get in the real world.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.621
It's no surprise
that addiction follows so quickly.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.533
Max, what are you doing?

15:09.284 --> 15:10.911
Go away.
You wouldn't understand.

15:11.203 --> 15:13.121
I understand Spellbinder's
got you hooked

15:13.205 --> 15:15.499
- and you're stealing for him.
- So what?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.501
So keep at it, and you'll end up a veg.

15:17.918 --> 15:18.752
Listen to me.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.254
You don't have clue
how good it feels, Terry.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.340
Everybody wants you in there.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.592
And the second you're back out here,

15:25.801 --> 15:27.594
your whole body hurts for more.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.888
I just wanna get back inside.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.515
It's an addiction, Max.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.433
He's messed up your brain chemistry.

15:33.809 --> 15:34.935
Come on, let me help you.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.146
If you wanna help me so much,

15:38.230 --> 15:41.066
then leave me alone. Let go of me!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.274
Ahh!

15:53.036 --> 15:54.830
The couch will be fine, James.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.915
Your whole family lives here?

15:57.124 --> 16:00.293
Whole family is just me
and my sister most of the time.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.504
The folks split up when I was a kid.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.756
And Mom's on the road a lot for work.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.092
I guess you and I both have our secrets.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.720
Except mine seems
kind of pathetic right now.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.348
Hey, at least you don't
have to wear tights.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.518
Speaking of secrets,
I gotta call the guy.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.660
Then you'll take me back to Spellbinder?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.315
It's me. Yeah, she's fine.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.859
I'm letting her rest a bit and then-

16:25.610 --> 16:26.611
Terry!

16:27.696 --> 16:29.614
<i>Whoever you are, when he wakes up,</i>

16:30.073 --> 16:31.199
<i>tell him I'm sorry.</i>

16:37.164 --> 16:39.541
Hey, easy on the car.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.793
I can't believe
I got her involved in this.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.254
Now you sound like Batman.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.048
<i>- What?
- I've been right Where you are,</i>

16:47.632 --> 16:49.050
<i>more times than I care to count.</i>

16:49.134 --> 16:50.135
<i>And like you said,</i>

16:50.510 --> 16:52.110
<i>there's no way you could've stopped her.</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:55.347
There's Donny.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.435
I'II feel better once I wring
Spellbinder's location out of his face.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.104
Or you could cool yourjets
and just tail him.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.773
Oh. I guess that's a good idea, too.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.745
- What are you doing here?
- It's gonna be okay.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.914
Yeah, when you get out of my life!

18:43.206 --> 18:46.084
This is what I wanna do.
You have no right to stop me.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.086
You can't just live in a fantasy world.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.339
Why not? What's so great about reality?

18:51.715 --> 18:53.633
People care about me in there.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.427
Why can't you just let me have that?

18:55.510 --> 18:56.845
You're smarter than this, Max.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.097
And if you'd cut the lonely victim act
for a second,

18:59.180 --> 19:00.640
you'd see this is for your own good.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.061
Why couldn't you listen to me?

19:09.274 --> 19:11.318
Yeah, Batman.
Why couldn't you listen?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.236
Who made you the pleasure police?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.868
Don't worry, dear.
He won't interfere again.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.878
Don't kill him, okay?
He won't come back.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.004
I'm sure of it.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.589
This is none of your concern.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.675
Go on. Your dream world awaits.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.746
<i>And now that doctors have
studied Spellbinder's VR technology,</i>

20:04.913 --> 20:06.164
<i>they're successfully treating</i>

20:06.247 --> 20:08.833
<i>the psycho psychologist's
remaining victims.</i>

20:09.000 --> 20:11.753
You can say it already,
I almost got us both killed

20:11.836 --> 20:13.088
'cause I wouldn't butt out.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.213
It worked out okay.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.508
I just wanted to be a part of something.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.711
Well, congratulations,
'cause you're a part of it now.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.887
But we'll take it a little
slower from now on.
