WEBVTT

00:07.590 --> 00:11.260
So the security cameras in the
cashier's office just cut out.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.880
You know, if you really
wanted to see me again,

00:13.930 --> 00:15.300
you didn't have to go through
all this trouble.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.930
You know, tampering
with the security system

00:16.970 --> 00:18.220
for the entire university.

00:18.260 --> 00:20.100
You think a lot of yourself.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.770
I kinda have to, 'cause no one
else will. So...

00:22.810 --> 00:24.480
Yeah, I'm sure it's nothing.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.850
But I need to make sure.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.110
We have seventeen
thousand students.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.270
So, thanks for coming.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.690
You're very pretty when
you talk numbers.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.490
I wanna thank you
for the other night.

00:33.530 --> 00:34.950
I had a great time.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.570
I bet you had no idea that
date would lead you to

00:36.620 --> 00:39.490
having to protect two hundred
thousand dollars in cash.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.580
You're worth it.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.960
So, remind me how much we're
getting paid for this?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.830
We doing a favor.
For a friend.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.800
[Mal] And I suppose your
friends are with those

00:50.840 --> 00:51.920
benefit things.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.590
And now, I'm part
of the package.

00:53.630 --> 00:56.010
Oh my God. That is
the most disgusting thing

00:56.050 --> 00:57.550
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.070
Thank you.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.610
[ringing]

01:16.740 --> 01:17.910
Hey.

01:17.950 --> 01:19.370
We're still at
the university.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.040
Oh. Are you gonna make
it to the airport?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.490
God only knows.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.370
Jake has us on some thing
he's doing to impress a girl.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.960
Well, I guess he could use
a bit of that right now.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.460
I can do the airport meeting.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.750
Yeah. It's an
important gig for us.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.130
It could bring us some
good cash.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.050
And you're the best one to
lock it down anyways.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.340
Go get 'em.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.880
Well thank you for the vote
of confidence.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.470

The live footage seems to be
working fine.

01:50.730 --> 01:52.980
See. That's exactly
what happened last time.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.150
My phone's lost signal.
What did you do?

01:55.190 --> 01:56.280
I didn't do nothing, b'y.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.650
There's something wrong here.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.280
- We should call the cops.
- What?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.580
Why? What's going on?

Get going with them.

Alright.

Go to the copy room.
Give me the keys.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.190
I would like to rent
your apartment.

03:15.110 --> 03:17.230
No. No. I don't have any pets.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.700
And yes, I have friends.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
A few friends.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.660
But I'm a private investigator.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.620
So I was thinking we could do
an in-kind arrangement

03:25.660 --> 03:29.160
where I'll make sure your
husband isn't having an affair.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.540
I'll follow him for a bit.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.000
And make sure those

Des, you might wanna reel
in the last part a bit.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.010
I know. I know.
I just need to find a place

03:40.050 --> 03:41.380
so I can spend
some time with T--

03:42.390 --> 03:43.340
Myself.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.890
Right.

03:45.970 --> 03:47.720
Whatever. Do you
know where Jake is?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.850
Well, all hands are on deck for
a pretty big contract.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.100
So he probably won't
be back for a bit.

04:01.030 --> 04:03.070
[Des] Oh hey. How's the airport

04:03.110 --> 04:04.280
Did you get the contract?

04:04.320 --> 04:05.660
I mean, no pressure.
It's just that there's

04:05.700 --> 04:06.120
so much riding on this.

Actually, we haven't
started yet.

Great.
Hey, listen.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.180
Will you let me know
if you hear from Mal or Jake.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.600

I'm a little worried.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.810

everything's fine

a hostage taking at Memorial

not much is known

Alright look.

I don't want any heroics
from you people.

trust me, I will,

Alright.

05:29.740 --> 05:31.120

05:31.160 --> 05:32.540

Alarm's off. No sweat.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.250
Now I got control of the power.

05:40.290 --> 05:41.550
How do you like that action?

05:41.590 --> 05:43.960
[Grant] Great work.
How about the camera?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.010
Relax.
I'm working on it.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.720
Plan?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.680
Well.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.560
We're out gunned.
And we're out... masked.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.520
So let's call in the cops.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.520
Or not.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.610
Something's jamming the signal.

06:01.610 --> 06:03.570
My guess is that's
the culprit.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.900
[Eva]
You think that's bad.

06:05.940 --> 06:08.030
As soon as they hack into the
cameras, they'll spot us.

06:08.070 --> 06:09.740
We gotta move before
that happens.

06:09.780 --> 06:12.160
There's cameras everywhere.
And there's tons out there.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.620
What about the offices
in the back?

06:14.660 --> 06:15.660
Are there any cameras in there?

06:15.700 --> 06:17.040
We kept them out for privacy.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.000
Great.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.080
That's where we
gotta get to.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.420
We get a land line.
We call the cops.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.670
How are we gonna get past them?

06:22.170 --> 06:23.170
We just---

06:23.210 --> 06:24.710
We wait for our moment.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.550
[Grant] You know, we're
falling behind schedule here.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.050

I know how to read a clock.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.390

06:38.640 --> 06:40.400
You guys go now.
I'll distract him.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.400
Hell of a third date.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.440
Next time, let's stay in.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.900
- Go.
- Careful.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.070

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Who the hell?

06:52.410 --> 06:53.830
Don't shoot!

06:53.870 --> 06:55.040
Don't move.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.450
I'm not moving.
I just-- I'm--

06:57.500 --> 07:00.540
I heard the alarm.
And I thought

07:00.580 --> 07:02.130
that it might have been a fire.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.290
But obviously it's not a fire
unless the fire department's

07:04.340 --> 07:05.800
changed its uniforms.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.050
[Amy]
Is anyone else with you?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.550
No. I'm--

07:10.590 --> 07:12.050
It's just me.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.470
[Grant]
Okay.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.600
We'll put you in the back
with the others.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.350
You don't try anything stupid.
And we won't have a problem.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.190
Come on. Keep moving.

07:27.230 --> 07:28.530
Keep moving.

07:28.570 --> 07:29.700
Come on.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.580
Open the door.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.310
[Amy]
The cameras are ours.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.310
Ah. Finally.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.810
It's hard to breathe in
this thing, isn't it?

08:02.270 --> 08:03.600
Oh yeah. That looks
much better.

08:04.770 --> 08:06.400
Keep your eyes off me.
And stay focused.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.480
[Mal]
You recognize them?

08:08.530 --> 08:09.860
No. I haven't seen them before.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.820
But the school has
a lot of students.

08:11.860 --> 08:12.740
Yeah.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.120
[siren]

08:24.580 --> 08:25.750
Any word yet?

08:25.790 --> 08:27.090
Nothing from the inside.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.800

08:29.840 --> 08:30.050
[Mal] [on phone] Leslie, it's me.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.220
Malachy. Sorry.
Not a good time.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.550
I realize you think
you're in the middle

08:34.590 --> 08:35.840
of a hostage situation.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.640
But I am literally in
the middle of it.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.930
- You're what? - I'm inside.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.810
We have
perps.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.190
Two of them.
Young, armed,

08:46.230 --> 08:46.860
possibly students.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.270
Can't be sure.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.440
And they've got control
of the security cameras.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.400
Hostages?

08:51.440 --> 08:52.490
Nine.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.280
No one hurt yet.
Jake's inside with them.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.490
And I've got cover for now.

08:56.530 --> 08:57.870
How did you get
in there, Malachy?

08:58.530 --> 08:59.740
One word: Jake.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.250
They've used something to block
all cell and web service.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.210
What are we looking at
in terms of firearms?

09:06.250 --> 09:07.710
A shotgun, and

09:07.750 --> 09:10.090
a semi-automatic pistol
is all I can see right now.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.050
Is Jake...?

09:11.090 --> 09:12.380
Yeah. We're fine.
We're both fine.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.510
Stay out of sight
and keep this line open.

09:14.550 --> 09:15.930
The front entrance
is sealed up.

09:15.970 --> 09:18.140
But there's a fire exit
we could possibly access.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.010
And I've got a
civilian with me.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.390
Eva...

09:20.430 --> 09:22.470
Eva Laurent. I'm head of
security for the university.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.270
Great. Just great.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.520
Malachy? Stay put
and be careful.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.440
No heroics, please.

09:29.690 --> 09:30.650
Okay.

09:30.690 --> 09:31.900
The bad news is,
if it gets too hot

09:31.940 --> 09:33.650
in here, we're all
gonna have to get naked.

09:33.690 --> 09:34.240
But the good news is...

09:35.240 --> 09:37.240
We might all have
to get naked.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.200
I'm just-- joking.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.410
No one needs to get naked.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.910
I'm just-- trying to
get us all relaxed.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.830
Okay? Don't worry. This crowd's
gonna get whatever they wants.

09:48.210 --> 09:49.830
They're gonna leave.
And we'll all be outta here

09:49.880 --> 09:51.880
in time for happy hour
at the Breezeway.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.880
Hood!

09:53.920 --> 09:54.970
Let's get those adjacent

09:55.010 --> 09:56.470
floors evacuated.
And get the Tactical

09:56.510 --> 09:58.510
Response Unit
down here pronto.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.550
And look into that fire exit
Mal was talking about.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.140
On it.

10:01.890 --> 10:03.060
You still there, Mal?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.140
Yeah, I'm here.
But something's off.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.770
The robbers are not going
for the cash.

10:06.810 --> 10:07.890
[Leslie]
What do you mean?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.810
There's two hundred grand
in the tills.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.190
Haven't even looked at them.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.820
The money's not why
they're here?

10:12.860 --> 10:14.570
I'm guessing they're waiting
for you to make contact.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.070
Copy.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.450
Someone else is
in here with us.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.000
Alright.
I'll check the offices.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.410
You keep your eyes
peeled out here.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.250
If there's someone else here,
we're gonna find them.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.880
- They're on to us.
- They're headed this way.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.840
Hang up.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.760
We have to find a spot.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.680
Fast.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.060
[ringing]

10:46.480 --> 10:47.440
Cops.

10:47.940 --> 10:48.890
Finally.

10:54.270 --> 10:57.240
Now. You've got my attention.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.320
[disguised voice] Let's see for how long.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.820
My name is Sergeant
Leslie Bennett.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.450
Do you have any idea what you've
gotten yourself into here?

11:01.490 --> 11:03.030
Shut up.

11:03.070 --> 11:05.910
We've got nine hostages. They're
alive. And will remain that way

11:05.950 --> 11:07.160
as long as you do what I say.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.960
Right. Do you think this
is gonna work?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.580
I want a Helicopter--

11:11.630 --> 11:12.670
At the Health Science Centre.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.210
And safe passage to it.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.510
- Do you hear me? - I do.

11:17.550 --> 11:19.170
I just gotta ask
you one question.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.260
Are you being serious?

11:20.300 --> 11:22.090
Or did you see this work
in some movie?

11:22.140 --> 11:25.060
I assure you.
I'm very serious.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.480
One hour.
Make it happen.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.690
Tell the nice policeman to get
away from the building.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.530
I see another cop within ten
feet and a hostage will die.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.160
Okay. He's gone.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.870
Can't blame me
for trying, right?

11:47.740 --> 11:49.000
What do I call you?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.370
Call me Blue.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.880
And give me what I want.
Or this will get very ugly.

11:53.330 --> 11:54.290
One hour.

12:03.430 --> 12:06.510
Hell of a day for me to forget
my lock picking set.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.020
No, I'm not a...

12:08.060 --> 12:09.890
I'm not a crook.

12:09.930 --> 12:10.890
I don't pick locks.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.190
I'm a P.I.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.940
Never mind.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.620
Anyone here got a lighter?

12:30.370 --> 12:32.710
It's good to know that no one
smokes any more. Good.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.880
Next question?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.170
Who here takes chemistry?

12:45.470 --> 12:47.100
Perfect.
Pass me the garbage can.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.010
[Tinny] What was with
that back there?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.520
I don't know.
Bucko--that landlord?

12:51.560 --> 12:53.770
What was all this talk about
first and last month's rent?

12:53.810 --> 12:55.230
I said: Pick one.
And get off the fence.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.770
You're the one who needs
to make a decision here.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.900
Or else you're gonna be living
in a van down by the river.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.690
Yeah. Well, as long
as you came to see me--

13:00.730 --> 13:02.280
I wouldn't care.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.950
You know, I don't even care who
knows that we're going out.

13:05.990 --> 13:07.280
Des.
We've been over this.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.700
I don't know if
you know this,

13:08.740 --> 13:10.160
Constable
Katrina Doyle--

13:10.200 --> 13:14.370
But I'm a very, very strong
independent man

13:14.410 --> 13:17.000
who, very soon, will be
living in his own place.

13:17.540 --> 13:18.590
Is that so?

13:18.630 --> 13:20.250
It is, actually.
And therefore--

13:20.290 --> 13:22.710
I don't need anyone to give me
permission to go out with you.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.720
[ringing]
That's Jake!

13:23.760 --> 13:24.470
He knows we're at it.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.140
[siren]

13:30.140 --> 13:31.680
We got hostages inside.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.770
So we might need you guys to
go in at a moment’s notice.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.600
Leslie? Hi.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.940
There's a robbery at the
university's Cashier's office.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.480
Malachy and Jake are inside.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.150
What? Are they okay?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.110
They're fine. And we're doing
everything to make sure

13:45.150 --> 13:46.490
that stays that way.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.570
But I could use
an extra hand.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.450
There's some tech stuff I hear
you're an ace with.

13:50.490 --> 13:51.740
I’m on my way.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.290
- What's going on?
- Get in.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.580
You need to get the Tactical
Response Unit

13:56.620 --> 13:57.540
to storm the place.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.290
Nobody's storming
nothing yet.

13:59.330 --> 14:00.710
Sorry, b'y.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.670
Sorry.
[ringing]

14:02.710 --> 14:03.960
Leslie.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.590
They're okay.
Both of them.

14:05.630 --> 14:06.840
And I hate to put it this way,

14:06.880 --> 14:07.380
but I don't have time
to talk about this.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.010
Leslie, you can't expect me
to just sit here.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.100
I can help.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.890
Rose. I know you're worried.

14:12.930 --> 14:14.680
I want Jake and Mal safe
as much as you do.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.390
But we're the police.
We know what we're doing.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.650
Well. Let me know
if you need me.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.900
Sit this out.
I don't think so.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.860
[Mal] So you're
dating my son.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.570
Is this really
the time to...?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.780
You know he just got
out of a relationship?

14:32.830 --> 14:33.870
He didn't say.

14:34.910 --> 14:35.750
Was it serious?

14:35.790 --> 14:36.910
You might wanna ask him.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.080
Three dates?
He shoulda told you by now.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.500
Wait.
Are you saying I'm a --

14:40.540 --> 14:41.710
a rebound?

14:41.750 --> 14:44.460
It depends. You
planning on a fourth date?

14:44.500 --> 14:48.760
Ah, Yes. I suppose.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.180
[door opening]

14:50.220 --> 14:51.100
Shhh.

14:55.270 --> 14:55.930
[Grant]
Anyone in here?

14:57.060 --> 14:58.770
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

15:02.150 --> 15:03.650
[beeping]

15:15.330 --> 15:17.710
[Amy]
Grant! Get back here.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.710
What was that?

15:38.350 --> 15:40.440
The phone was just
off the hook.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.690
- What's going on?
- You're supposed to be

15:41.730 --> 15:43.650
watching them.
Do something.

15:43.690 --> 15:46.480
There's no need for
the attitude, okay?

15:46.520 --> 15:47.900
You just soften up a little bit

15:47.940 --> 15:49.530
and it will go a lot easier
for both of us.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.950
Please... Do it.

15:53.910 --> 15:55.240
Put your mask on.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.750
Ah!

16:08.880 --> 16:10.380
You're alright.
You're alright.

16:11.550 --> 16:13.050
Now you've seen my face.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.180
Gotta get you inside.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.390
You shouldn't have done that.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.890
Drop it.

16:17.930 --> 16:21.440
Now. We got ourselves a bit
of a situation here.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.690
I got a gun pointed at your
buddy's head.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.400
[Amy]
No. He's not my buddy.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.440
By the way, I have
a gun pointed at him.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.360
Don't shoot.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.570
You know you're
supposed to be

16:33.610 --> 16:34.990
a security guard, right?

16:35.030 --> 16:35.950
A security guard.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.660
I will shoot.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.450
And we both know you won't.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.340
Alright. Fine.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.470
Put the guard back
with the others.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.140
Now we need to kill him.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Everything's under control.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.480
Under control?
He set you on fire.

17:03.520 --> 17:08.190
B'ys. I forgot to tell you.
I have a very special skill.

17:09.110 --> 17:10.900
I'm really good at lock picking.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.820
You know, I'm a locksmith.
So--

17:12.860 --> 17:14.450
if you guys have a vault
that you gotta break into.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.070
I can't help you
if I'm dead.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.570
Yeah, I think
we'll chance it.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.660
Do it before he comes up
with another plan.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.080
We're killing people now?

17:22.120 --> 17:23.120
Kill him.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.420
Or I kill you.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.790
You're falling apart here.

17:27.830 --> 17:30.880
Yeah. I wouldn't be if you
weren't screwing up so much.

17:30.920 --> 17:31.800
Do it.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.760
Hey. You know what, b'ys?
Nobody needs to die.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.680
Right?

17:40.010 --> 17:41.970
I'm also a very good
negotiator.

17:42.010 --> 17:44.600
So I can help you get
your chopper.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.560
Your bus, whatever.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.190
You've see our faces. Sorry.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.270
Here's the thing with that.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.070
I have a terrible memory.

17:52.110 --> 17:54.740
In fact.
I'm face blind.

17:54.780 --> 17:56.740
Face blind. Have you ever heard
of it? It's a real thing.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.070
Do it.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.160
You're messed up. You know that?
You're messed up.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.490
Come on.

18:02.160 --> 18:02.200
Go.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.370
And come back and we get
the security guard.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.130
I'm sorry Man. She--

18:17.970 --> 18:18.220
I didn't want to kill you.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.310
Good news is, you don't have
to. Okay. Just think about it.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.470
You two. You're in way
over your heads.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.890
Alright. It's not too
late to get out of this.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.270
Shut up.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.690
Don't make this any harder
that it needs to be.

18:29.730 --> 18:32.020
Okay. Think about it.
We could gang up.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.190
We'll take her down.

18:33.230 --> 18:34.440
I'll tell the cops helped me.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.740
You'll get, you know,
a slap on the wrist.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.070
[click]

18:37.110 --> 18:37.740
- [Grant] Sorry.
- [Jake] You're sorry?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.910
You're about to end my life
and you expect me to accept

18:41.950 --> 18:43.240
your little apology?

18:43.280 --> 18:44.870
Well, I'm telling you.
It's not good enough.

18:44.910 --> 18:46.290
So listen,
just listen.

18:46.330 --> 18:47.410
Stay there.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.250
Before you kill me.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.830
Before I die.
I just want a favor.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.540
- Is that so much to ask?
- Come on.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.300
- A small, tiny favor?
- What is it?

18:55.340 --> 18:56.380
Never mind.

18:59.590 --> 19:00.760
[Grant]
Let go!

19:00.800 --> 19:01.930
Who the hell are these guys?

19:01.970 --> 19:03.140
[Mal]
Jake!

19:03.180 --> 19:04.260
Careful with that thing!

19:06.350 --> 19:07.390
[bang]

19:23.620 --> 19:24.950
[Des]
So I spoke with Tinny.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.790
And Leslie doesn't think
this robbery

19:26.830 --> 19:28.080
has anything to do with money.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.160
So...

19:29.210 --> 19:30.620
What else could it be?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.040
Well, why would they
hit the place?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.250
Something's not adding up.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.840
Which is ironic considering

19:35.880 --> 19:36.550
the strength of their
math department.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.840
Sorry. Sorry. I find a little
workplace humor helps

19:40.880 --> 19:42.550
in these tense--

19:42.590 --> 19:44.140
No? Okay. Alright.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.060
I'm pulling up the floor plans
for the Cashier's office.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.520
Maybe that will shine
a light on something.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.310
[ringing]

19:49.350 --> 19:50.480
Is that yours?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.650
No. My phone's charging
after six hours

19:52.690 --> 19:55.020
of unsuccessful
landlord tenant negotiations.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.030
Oh. Sloan must have forgot it.

20:01.070 --> 20:02.070
Everything all right?

20:02.110 --> 20:03.990
One of my contacts
is calling Sloan.

20:04.740 --> 20:05.910
A doctor friend of mine.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.160
Sloan's sick.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.660
Oh. That explains her bad
and weird behavior.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.040
He's not a medical doctor.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.370
He works at the Police Lab.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.920
What's Sloan doing
with the police?

20:27.680 --> 20:28.720
Is it done?

20:32.020 --> 20:33.850
He was trouble.
And you know it.

20:36.310 --> 20:37.860
It's time to get moving on
why we're actually here.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.320
Keep an eye
on the hostages.

20:40.110 --> 20:41.450
We won't kill the guard.

20:42.150 --> 20:43.030
Happy?

20:53.710 --> 20:54.920
[ringing]

20:57.210 --> 20:59.090
Blue. We heard a gunshot.
Is everyone okay?

20:59.130 --> 21:01.800
Lady. Concern yourself with
getting us what we asked for.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.220
Or more hostages
will get hurt.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.180
More?

21:04.220 --> 21:05.130
What do you mean?

21:05.180 --> 21:06.800
This is gonna go
very badly --

21:08.970 --> 21:10.390
What are you planning?

21:12.770 --> 21:13.640
Bennett?

21:14.560 --> 21:15.730
It's your call.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.690
Storm it. Now.

21:19.730 --> 21:20.820
Hell ya.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.490
But Poppy and Jake.

21:22.530 --> 21:23.950
I waited as long as I could.

21:23.990 --> 21:25.360
Shots have been fired.
We have to go.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.280
[ringing]

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
Malachy?

21:29.280 --> 21:31.450
- You can hear us?
- Loud and clear.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.620
Did you take out the jammer?

21:32.660 --> 21:33.620
We heard shots.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.040
Everyone's fine.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.330
We've got a bit of a window
to get the hostages out.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.380
But I need your help.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.460
What could we do?

21:39.500 --> 21:40.920
We need to get
these cameras off us.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.130
Well, we can block
the frequency.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.670
We just need the
password to access it.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.510
- Tinny?
- Hey Poppy.

21:45.550 --> 21:46.340
Sounds like I'm in good hands.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.760
I can help you with the cameras.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.550
We just need a sign to know
when the cameras are off.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.220
We need you to call
the robbers when they are.

21:52.260 --> 21:54.350
I can do that. But we
don't have much time.

21:54.390 --> 21:55.770
Once we get those hostages,

21:55.810 --> 21:58.150
our Tactical Response Unit
is coming in.

21:58.190 --> 21:59.650
We should get ready.

22:01.190 --> 22:03.490
What's going on?
Where's my outfit?

22:03.530 --> 22:04.150
Shush.

22:05.030 --> 22:06.740
Be happy this is all we did.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.820
You might remember you tried
to kill my son?

22:08.860 --> 22:10.950
You wanna go down as hard
as your partner did?

22:10.990 --> 22:12.080
It's up to you.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.700
What do you want?

22:13.740 --> 22:15.120
Why are you robbing this place?

22:16.250 --> 22:18.330
Who said we are robbing
this place?

22:24.210 --> 22:26.010
[gasping]

22:27.720 --> 22:30.350
What? Oh. Sorry.

22:31.470 --> 22:32.260
It's just me.

22:32.310 --> 22:32.350
Good news.

22:33.850 --> 22:36.850
One bad guy down. And one
more to go. Well, it's a --

22:36.890 --> 22:38.190
It's a girl, actually.

22:38.230 --> 22:39.650
But that's
besides the point. Listen--

22:40.940 --> 22:42.940
Where were my
chemistry majors again?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.400
Perfect.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.030
Story on those cameras.
Quick.

22:49.070 --> 22:49.700
Tech's jamming it as we speak.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.370
Some brain on you, Constable.
Smart thinking.

22:53.410 --> 22:53.990
I wouldn't have taken
you as a techie.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.460
Well, hanging with Des
has its plusses.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.420
I bet.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.790
I just wanna get in there.

23:00.830 --> 23:01.750
I feel like busting
down those doors.

23:03.130 --> 23:06.260
Restraint. That's what being
a cop is all about.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.090
Frequency's jammed.
We're ready.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.430
Come on.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.720
[Amy]
How'd that happen?

23:14.760 --> 23:16.470
Grant! We've got trouble.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.600
[ringing]

23:30.360 --> 23:32.320
The front door's
the closest way out.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.240
You stay here.
I'll back Jake up.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.410
I know this place inside out.

23:35.450 --> 23:36.540
I appreciate that.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.830
But we need you to I.D.
the kids in case

23:38.870 --> 23:40.080
something
happens to me and Jake.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.420
[Grant]
Oh, hey. Look. Wait guys.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.290
If you just leave me here,

23:43.330 --> 23:45.090
the cops aren't gonna know
that I helped you guys out.

23:45.130 --> 23:46.090
What help?

23:46.130 --> 23:47.260
Before there with the...

23:48.170 --> 23:48.970
Tell us what the real plan is.

23:50.380 --> 23:53.180
We might be more inclined to
speak on your behalf.

23:53.220 --> 23:56.010
I can't. Amy would--
She'd kill me.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.270
So her name is Amy?

23:59.930 --> 24:00.810
I'll scream.

24:01.440 --> 24:01.900
Suit yourself.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.400
No-- I was kidding.
I won't scream.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.690
Are you serious?

24:08.610 --> 24:09.990
Stay here. I'll be back.

24:30.550 --> 24:31.510
Alright. Let's go.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.590
Did you actually train
for this job?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.600
Or did you have an uncle
in charge, or something?

24:40.890 --> 24:42.270
Go. Go!

24:55.950 --> 24:56.830
Mmmm.

24:57.950 --> 24:58.830
Screw it.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.120
Let's get the hostages
to safety.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.710
Then we're going in together.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.720
Don't shoot. It's me.

25:14.340 --> 25:15.260
Fancy meeting you here.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.510
Jake.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.180
What about Dad and Eva?

25:19.220 --> 25:20.140
Did they get out?

25:20.180 --> 25:21.100
Not yet.

25:24.310 --> 25:25.390
[Leslie]
Wait. Jake!

25:25.440 --> 25:26.350
[Jake]
It's the only way.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.310
[bang]

25:27.350 --> 25:28.860
Hold your fire!
That was Jake!

25:28.900 --> 25:30.280
I didn't know!

25:31.690 --> 25:32.860
Did I hit him?

25:36.570 --> 25:37.620
Blow the door.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.670
[Jake] Thank God that was
Hood that was shooting.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.670
We gotta take her with us.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.010
Are the rest of the
hostages locked up?

25:55.510 --> 25:56.550
Good.
Let's get moving.

25:56.590 --> 25:57.890
Look. Let me go.

25:57.930 --> 25:59.300
Nothing you say will help you.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.600
So shut your mouth and
do what we say. Got me?

26:03.770 --> 26:04.640
Go.

26:09.150 --> 26:09.690
[Rose] There's gotta be
something we're missing.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.230
If the robbers aren't
after cash--

26:12.270 --> 26:14.280
Why are they targeting
the Cashier's Office?

26:14.320 --> 26:15.900
Man, there's a lot of security
at this place.

26:15.950 --> 26:16.900
X-Ray scanners,

26:16.950 --> 26:18.700
guards, wicked old gear.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.870
You sure that's right?

26:19.910 --> 26:21.910
Why would they need
so much protection?

26:21.950 --> 26:23.660
Wait a second. The floor plans
are mislabeled.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.000
The security measures aren't for
the Cashier's office.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.580
They're for -

26:27.620 --> 26:30.580
the Engineering Lab below, which
has three times as many guards--

26:30.630 --> 26:32.050
Who have since been evacuated
because of the robbery.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.380
The robbers aren't targeting
the Cashier's Office.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.880
They're looking for something
in that lab.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.180
Split up.

27:00.820 --> 27:01.950
Look what I found.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.120
I'm pretty sure he's
one of the robbers.

27:04.580 --> 27:05.370
Ah.

27:05.410 --> 27:06.620
Easy.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.120
There were two of you.
Where's the other one?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.330
I want a deal.

27:09.370 --> 27:09.420
Here's the deal.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.960
You tell me. Or I'll tie you to
the back of my squad car

27:14.000 --> 27:15.210
and drag you
from here to Gander.

27:15.670 --> 27:17.170
[ringing]

27:20.090 --> 27:20.130
Bennett.

27:21.510 --> 27:22.970
The robbers aren't
after the Cashier's Office.

27:23.010 --> 27:23.970
They're after
the Engineering Lab

27:24.010 --> 27:25.060
on the floor below.

27:25.930 --> 27:26.930
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.310
But you're too late.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.350
I knew something wasn't right.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.690
Any clue what
they're looking for?

27:33.730 --> 27:35.280
No. But I will keep searching.

27:36.190 --> 27:37.190
Thank you.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.110
You're welcome.

27:40.530 --> 27:41.780
What do we do now boss?

27:48.830 --> 27:51.290
Get Constable Doyle to
find out who made this.

27:54.790 --> 27:56.460
I'm heading downstairs.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.590
Take our new
friend here into custody.

28:24.370 --> 28:24.410
Come on.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.450
The cops will be distracted for
another half hour or so.

28:28.490 --> 28:30.040
I left something
behind for them.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.960
Don't worry.
We'll be best kind.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.500
It's still not the worst
date I was ever on.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.210
Good to know.

28:36.290 --> 28:37.210
What did you say?

28:37.250 --> 28:37.550
Nothing.

28:38.460 --> 28:39.630
But you might
as well give up,

28:39.670 --> 28:40.880
'Cause the cops have
the place surrounded.

28:41.340 --> 28:42.300
Really?

28:43.510 --> 28:45.640
Good thing I got a
ride waiting for us.

29:18.670 --> 29:19.750
[Mal]
Okay.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.100
Enough of this.

29:32.930 --> 29:33.940
Whoo.

29:36.810 --> 29:37.900
Where are they?

29:39.150 --> 29:40.070
Mal?

29:41.030 --> 29:42.110
They've gone.

29:42.150 --> 29:43.280
But I found this.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.910
That should take care
of things.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.460
He's gonna be there, right?

29:56.500 --> 29:58.040
Because if you've got
the time wrong...

29:59.710 --> 30:01.590
You know we're clear of
the university now.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.380
We don't need girlie
back there.

30:06.300 --> 30:06.470
Shoot her.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.180
What?
You're gonna kill me?

30:09.800 --> 30:10.850
[Amy]
Do it.

30:15.350 --> 30:17.100
I was wondering why
you got so quiet.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.360
Take off your mask.

30:24.530 --> 30:25.610
Surprise.

30:32.620 --> 30:33.490
Okay.

30:34.790 --> 30:36.790
Before you get all
shootie.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.960
Maybe we should talk
about this.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.330
What did you do with Grant?

30:40.380 --> 30:42.000
He needed to take a nap.

30:42.040 --> 30:42.880
Okay. He'll be fine.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.340
Just let us go.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.630
At this point, think about it.
You haven't hurt anybody.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.630
You mean yet.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.930
Just keep talking, buddy,
and that might change.

31:00.230 --> 31:00.900
[bang]

31:01.310 --> 31:02.190
[bang]

31:06.780 --> 31:07.900
Get out of the car.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.660
Come on.

31:19.620 --> 31:20.580
Are you okay?

31:20.620 --> 31:21.880
I think so.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.500
I'm starting to see why
you're so single.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.050
[Des] Memorial University

31:29.090 --> 31:30.470
just bought a
state of the art 3D printer

31:30.510 --> 31:31.510
for the engineering lab.

31:31.550 --> 31:32.680
That's what the
robbers are after.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.640
A what?

31:33.680 --> 31:34.600
A 3D printer. It's like--

31:35.470 --> 31:36.680
It's like a normal printer.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.310
But instead of using
paper, it uses plastic.

31:38.350 --> 31:39.730
And it can--

31:39.770 --> 31:42.400
It can create any 3D object
that you can think of.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.860
I wonder if it could make
a printer. That's fried.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.190
How does the printer
know what to make?

31:47.230 --> 31:49.990
By sending it schematics.
It's like--

31:50.030 --> 31:51.150
It's like a digital recipe.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.660
Is there any way
for the police to find out

31:52.700 --> 31:54.780
- what the robbers printed?
- There'd be a record if it.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.580
The police would be able to
print anything the robbers did.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.120
Great.
I'm calling Leslie.

32:00.160 --> 32:00.290
Oh.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.540
Hey. I thought
you guys were out.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.420
What you got there?

32:05.460 --> 32:06.130
Homework.

32:07.130 --> 32:08.760
Ya. So...
I will let you guys...

32:08.800 --> 32:09.720
Wait, wait. Hold on.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.550
Is everything
all right with you?

32:13.550 --> 32:15.220
- Oh, I love these chats.
- Sloan.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.350
Just be
straight with me.

32:17.390 --> 32:18.770
Weirdo, I'm fine.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.020
I'm good.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.730
- What?
- I saw you. I saw--

32:23.980 --> 32:26.770
I saw you take Jake's
razor earlier. Okay?

32:28.320 --> 32:31.900
Now. I don't know what you're
doing. But don't be at it.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.530
Funny. I could say the same
about you and Tinny.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.670
What are you thinking?

32:49.170 --> 32:50.340
What do you got?

32:50.380 --> 32:52.090
According to her text books,
her name is Amy.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.090
But she wasn't kind enough to
write her full name in them.

32:56.390 --> 32:57.720
This is a doctorate
level course.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.520
That should make it easier
to narrow it down.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.270
I'll call my contacts.

33:02.310 --> 33:03.810
See if we can get this
girl identified.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.940
You're good at this,
Jake Doyle.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.690
Saved my life, like,
a bunch of times.

33:09.730 --> 33:11.530
Yeah. Well, the day's
not over yet.

33:18.080 --> 33:18.910
This can't be good.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.500
[Leslie] I was as
skeptical as you.

33:21.540 --> 33:22.410
But this 3D printer is real.

33:23.790 --> 33:26.250
It prints off whatever the
schematic tells it to.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.710
Any guesses what the
robbers broke in to print?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.960
Well, I'm guessing it's not
a friendship bracelet.

33:31.590 --> 33:32.800
But if what Des

33:32.840 --> 33:34.510
and Rose says
is correct--

33:34.550 --> 33:35.840
we're printing off a copy

33:35.880 --> 33:37.180
of what the robber
would have printed.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.100
[ringing]

33:41.470 --> 33:42.600
Oh my God, Jake.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.930
Where are you?
Are you okay?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.690
I'm, we're-- I'm fine.

33:46.730 --> 33:47.940
Listen, I think they left
a bomb behind.

33:48.770 --> 33:48.980
I know. Mal just found it.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.860
Good. Because that would have
been a lot of C4.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.450
Was there C4 in that firebomb?

33:54.490 --> 33:55.530
No.

33:55.570 --> 33:57.030
Okay.
Amy left her bag behind.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.450
We were looking through it.

33:58.490 --> 34:00.280
There's a C4 wrapper inside.

34:00.330 --> 34:00.370
There's another bomb.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.790
Whoever these guys are,
they're not robbers.

34:03.830 --> 34:05.210
And they're up to something big.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.790
I know. And they broke
into the Cashier's office

34:06.830 --> 34:08.880
to get access to a 3D printer.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.380
I think that was all
a distraction.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.460
For what?

34:11.500 --> 34:12.800
I don't know.
But do me a favor.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.970
We'll talk about it once
you get out of that place.

34:15.010 --> 34:17.300
Jake. That bomb
could be anywhere.

34:17.340 --> 34:18.390
[Mal]
It's here!

34:20.680 --> 34:23.470
They're getting rid of the
evidence. The firebomb--

34:23.520 --> 34:26.390
would have burnt away any
trace of fingerprints and DNA.

34:26.430 --> 34:30.860
And that C4 would destroy the
printer and its records. Great.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.570
Bomb! Everyone out!

34:32.610 --> 34:33.570
Leslie. Come on.

34:33.610 --> 34:34.940
We need the printout.

34:38.990 --> 34:39.910
A gun.

34:39.950 --> 34:41.160
She printed a gun?

34:41.200 --> 34:42.080
Get out of there.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
Dad?

34:49.210 --> 34:50.080
Leslie.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.800
Leslie. Do you hear me?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.470
I'm okay, Jake. So is Mal.
But you gotta stop her.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.720
She used the printer to print
a plastic gun.

35:03.760 --> 35:04.890
What?

35:04.930 --> 35:06.770
It's a long story.
It's a 3D printer.

35:06.810 --> 35:08.560
So far, no schematic
has produced

35:08.600 --> 35:10.190
a viable long term firearm.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.820
Officer. Our girl Amy may
have changed that.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.360
Hello? What?

35:14.400 --> 35:18.030
Amy Cohen. She's an ex-PHD
student at Memorial University.

35:18.070 --> 35:20.490
Her thesis involved producing
firearm schematics.

35:20.530 --> 35:22.910
So they might have printed
a real working gun.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.580
That shoot real bullets.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.250
Hang on a second.

35:28.410 --> 35:29.080
She's headed to the airport.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.920
Obviously that gun is not gonna
be picked up by security.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.670
And if she's using
ceramic bullets...

35:34.710 --> 35:36.420
I'll send Uniforms
to the Airport.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.220
- I'm closer.
- Jake.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.590
Listen. You wanna catch
her or not?

35:39.630 --> 35:40.630
I'll go get her.
Okay. Bye.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.590
Jake!

35:42.180 --> 35:43.100
All good?

35:44.760 --> 35:47.680
I think it's time I had a good
chat with your friend Grant.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.940
This has been a blast.
Literally.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.770
And I'm sorry it was so crazy.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.070
Not my worst date either.

35:59.070 --> 35:59.900
Jake.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.320
Be careful.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.550
You're gonna want to do pat
downs today. Trust me.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.850
- Yeah.
- [Tinny] Uncle Jake.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.440
I've got a lead that will
help you find Amy.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.730
Good.
'Cause it feels like

36:35.770 --> 36:37.650
half the friggin'
Avalon is here at the airport.

36:37.690 --> 36:38.980
The masks.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.780
It turns out Amy ordered a
costume to go with them.

36:40.820 --> 36:42.530
An airport custodial worker's.

36:42.570 --> 36:43.530
Good job.

36:44.280 --> 36:44.820
Custodial workers.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.370
There must be tons
of them here.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.000
[Leslie] Is this an
assassination attempt?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.250
What are you talking about?

36:57.290 --> 37:00.800
This isn't about killing
someone. This was about money.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.010
Amy's at the airport
meeting a buyer.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.010
Imagine the money she'll make
selling schematics for that gun.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.350
Why smuggle guns when you
can print your own?

37:10.390 --> 37:12.980
It can pass any security
system in the world.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.360
You give me a name now.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.320
And maybe you won't rot in
a terrorist prison forever.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.110
'Cause this.--
This is really bad.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.740
Okay? So whatever money you
think you're gonna make--

37:25.780 --> 37:26.910
It's not gonna help you.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.580
Okay fine.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.870
I was just doing it
for the cash, you know.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.460
The guy's name is Novak.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.500
[ringing]

37:41.880 --> 37:43.550
Leslie.
What do you got for me?

37:43.590 --> 37:46.180
You're looking for a Ben Novak.
He's an arms dealer.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.590
That's Amy's target.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.680
An arms dealer?
That should be easy.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.970
He came in on a private plane.
They don't have to declare

37:53.020 --> 37:55.730
their passengers but he
always uses the same pilot.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.600
They have a layover
before Heathrow.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.440
I've got airport security and a
million uniforms on their way.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.360
Why does Amy wanna kill
an arms dealer?

38:02.400 --> 38:04.990
No. She's planning on selling
the schematics to him.

38:05.030 --> 38:06.700
You gotta stand down.
Let the--

38:06.740 --> 38:07.530
And what? Let the airport
security handle it.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.660
Leslie, I'm your best bet,
and you know it.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.160
Is there a Ben Novak--

38:14.200 --> 38:18.170
--here? Anybody seen a
guy named Ben Novak?

38:18.210 --> 38:19.090
No?

38:21.670 --> 38:23.340
Ha. Ha. I can't believe--

38:23.380 --> 38:24.630
that actually worked.
Listen. I gotta talk to you

38:24.670 --> 38:25.590
about a deal.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.550
You're Amy.

38:26.590 --> 38:27.840
It's sort of a nick name.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.180
You? Again?

38:30.180 --> 38:32.220
- Hi.
- What's going on here?

38:32.640 --> 38:33.850
I'm Amy.

38:33.890 --> 38:35.730
I have the item you've
been asking for.

38:36.690 --> 38:37.400
How do I know it works?

38:38.230 --> 38:39.730
How about a demonstration?

38:42.230 --> 38:43.400
[bang]

38:54.080 --> 38:55.580
I have had enough of this.

38:55.620 --> 38:56.830
Okay.
Just--

38:56.870 --> 38:57.750
Arrgh!

38:59.870 --> 39:02.420
Okay.
I give up. I proved my point.

39:02.460 --> 39:03.380
He'll be in touch.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.210
Maybe. Or maybe not.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.090
[Officer] Drop it. On your knees.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.680
Don't shoot.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.540
It's been a while since you
waited in here.

39:38.290 --> 39:39.750
I was feeling nostalgic.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.540
Well you did good.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.130
Amy's going away for
a long time.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.920
What about the other fella?

39:46.960 --> 39:48.460
He cut a deal for
a lesser sentence

39:48.510 --> 39:50.510
in exchange for a testimony
against Amy and Novak.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.100
Not even his fancy lawyers
are gonna protect him.

39:54.140 --> 39:55.970
Looks like we still make
a pretty good team.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.980
Yeah. I was thinking
about that.

40:01.310 --> 40:01.350
Bennett.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.070
Callum's out in the parking
lot waiting for you.

40:05.940 --> 40:07.530
Didn't see you there Doyle.

40:07.570 --> 40:08.740
That's twice today.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.990
At least this time you
didn't shoot at me.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.660
So what? You got Callum
working as your chauffeur now?

40:18.700 --> 40:19.500
Sort of.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.580
How's that all going?

40:21.620 --> 40:22.790
You know. We're just--

40:22.830 --> 40:24.920
figuring out
what we are.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.250
Who we've become.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.170
He was gone for a long time.

40:30.590 --> 40:31.550
Yep.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.180
Jake.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.600
I'm so sorry.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.310
And I'm so glad you're okay.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.810
Well, I'm not exactly
top shelf, but --

40:43.270 --> 40:44.150
But I'll live.

40:44.770 --> 40:45.770
I'll see ya.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.190
See ya.

40:53.490 --> 40:54.450
You okay?

40:54.490 --> 40:55.740
I'm fine.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.280
New gal seems nice.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.290
Just don't even--

40:58.330 --> 40:59.830
Just saying.
Take your time.

41:00.870 --> 41:02.290
We both know where
your heart is.

41:02.330 --> 41:04.290
So don't go breaking
someone else's.

41:04.330 --> 41:05.250
Yeah.

41:07.170 --> 41:08.800
I was supposed to have plans
with my buddies.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.130
You know buddies--

41:10.170 --> 41:12.800
People not related to you
who you spend time with.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.510
But I think I'll cancel those
plans and I'll make you supper.

41:15.550 --> 41:16.720
Come on.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.640
Like you have any buddies.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.600
Hey!

41:19.640 --> 41:21.480
[Jake]
Name one.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.980
That's great.
Thank you so much.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.780
What's with the celebration?

41:30.820 --> 41:32.610
You are looking at
the newest renter

41:32.650 --> 41:35.570
of the nicest basement bachelor
apartment in St. John's.

41:36.870 --> 41:40.450
It may not have a tub.
But it has a large sink.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.250
Great. Is it far?

41:42.290 --> 41:43.960
It's five point six minutes
from the house.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.960
Less if you use your
siren. Don't--

41:46.000 --> 41:47.040
use your sirens.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.670
Well, do I get a tour?

41:48.710 --> 41:50.170
Yeah. Of course.

41:50.210 --> 41:51.010
Oh--

41:51.710 --> 41:53.260
Gross. Really gross.

41:53.300 --> 41:54.720
I'm scarred for life now.
Thank you.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.880
Come on Des. I'm buying.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.100
Good. 'Cause
I'm house poor now.

42:00.180 --> 42:00.890
[Rose]
Hey.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.640
You got a moment?

42:03.180 --> 42:03.230
Sure, what's up?

42:04.640 --> 42:06.350
Des told me you took Jake's
razor this morning.

42:06.390 --> 42:08.150
Rose.
It's not what you think.

42:08.190 --> 42:10.440
Well, I know you
didn't use it in a fight.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.570
I also know you
visited the lab.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.070
Do you mind telling me
what's happening?

42:23.660 --> 42:25.160
- Is this--?
- Yeah.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.170
- Does he--?
- No.

42:27.250 --> 42:29.080
- Jake's your fa --
- Looks like it.

42:31.550 --> 42:32.630
Jake's your what?
