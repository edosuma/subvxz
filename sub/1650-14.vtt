00:03.004 --> 00:05.746
( raspy breathing )

00:24.567 --> 00:26.432
Almost done.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.905
(sighs)

00:43.711 --> 00:45.326
Here.

00:53.930 --> 00:56.672
If only we had some cab'.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.056
Girls' night.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.685
( chains rattling )

01:08.069 --> 01:10.981
Boys are getting
restless again.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.779
You still haven't told me,

01:17.954 --> 01:20.912
where did you find them?

01:21.082 --> 01:23.994
Did they attack?
Did you hunt them down?

01:25.628 --> 01:27.414
Or did you know them?

01:33.970 --> 01:36.052
I'm so sorry.

01:36.222 --> 01:37.883
Oh, God.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.305
You want to talk
about it?

01:44.480 --> 01:46.596
( sniffles )

01:54.740 --> 01:56.605
Okay.

01:58.828 --> 02:01.160
They deserved
what they got.

02:03.708 --> 02:06.245
They weren't human
to begin with.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.062
( clanking )

02:49.045 --> 02:52.208
( breathing heavily )

03:04.852 --> 03:04.965
(theme music playing )

03:04.977 --> 03:06.888
(theme music playing )

03:51.857 --> 03:54.724
- You, grab the .50.
- You got it.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.901
The Governor wants all this?

04:01.075 --> 04:02.940
- He wants options.
- Where is he now?

04:03.119 --> 04:05.075
Not here.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.783
- How many are going out?
- Everybody.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.081
I thought there was
a deal on the table.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.719
I'm sure it's just a precaution,
a show of force.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.877
Milton.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.712
Milton!

05:05.264 --> 05:07.300
You need something?

05:11.020 --> 05:12.601
What is that?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.807
It's my workshop.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.143
How does that help
Woodbury?

05:19.445 --> 05:20.605
Excuse me?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.986
This was supposed
to be a new start,

05:23.157 --> 05:24.943
a way out.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.698
What about everything
we talked about?

05:26.869 --> 05:29.702
Beating this thing?
Clawing our way back?

05:31.415 --> 05:33.371
Look, this business
with Michonne,

05:33.542 --> 05:35.078
I understand.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.992
But the people
at the prison...

05:37.171 --> 05:39.503
What?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.083
Hmm?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.510
- I should move on?
- Yes.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.292
Well, I will
as soon as this is over.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.883
- Philip--
- Let me ask you something, huh?

05:48.057 --> 05:51.595
Do you still believe the biters
have some spark in them, huh?

05:51.769 --> 05:53.430
Of who they were?

05:53.604 --> 05:54.935
lthink so.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.642
Then that was
my daughter, wasn't it?

05:57.816 --> 06:01.149
Whether that was
Penny or not,

06:01.320 --> 06:03.481
it's done.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.398
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh...

06:10.037 --> 06:12.403
it's all that matters.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.794
There is no deal.
Philip's asked for Michonne.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.251
Rick would never
agree to that.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.040
Whether he hands
her over or not,

06:25.219 --> 06:27.585
he's gonna kill them all.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.596
- l have to stop this.
- I don't think you can.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.008
Leave.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.760
Tell the people at the prison
to get out of there.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.047
In time, he'll move on.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.840
No.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.095
l have to kill him.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.763
You'll never
get close to him.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.897
They'll gun
you down first.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.525
Only if they see me coming.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.652
Milton, this is sick.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.360
l can'tjust stand back
and watch this.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.900
( door opens)

07:35.414 --> 07:38.076
(floor creaks )

08:02.816 --> 08:05.683
(whistling)

08:16.538 --> 08:19.371
(rewinding)

08:21.043 --> 08:23.375
(whistling on tape)

08:27.383 --> 08:29.795
(rewinding)

08:29.968 --> 08:32.960
(whistling on tape)

08:49.154 --> 08:50.940
How can you
still protect him?

08:51.115 --> 08:53.276
He doesn't give a shit
aboutyou.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.988
I knew Philip before
he became the Governor.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.197
That man still exists.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.158
I don't believe that.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.323
Okay, so you kill
the Governor.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.038
Then you get shot
and Martinez takes over.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.373
What then?

09:07.548 --> 09:10.290
Killing the Governor
doesn't save your friends.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.177
Then I have to go back.
Warn them.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.088
And you're coming with me.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.803
I can't leave Woodbury.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.808
You really want
to be a part of this?

09:21.979 --> 09:23.594
I don't know anyone
at the prison.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.764
So what?
You know Merle. He fit in.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.773
You'll be fine.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.519
Like it or not,
I belong here.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.691
Then if you stay,

09:36.869 --> 09:39.702
you can't keep looking
the other way.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.037
Take care of yourself.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.302
You got any other weapons?

10:08.358 --> 10:12.977
Do you have more rounds?
What do you guys got?

10:13.155 --> 10:14.736
Andrea.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.114
Andrea!

10:19.995 --> 10:21.986
Governor wants
all weapons collected.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.779
Got to get the team
geared up.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.572
I think
I'm more helpful armed.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.616
Hand over your piece
and any ammo.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.456
No.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.245
Let's not be stupid
about this.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.924
Hand over your piece.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.343
You got a knife?

10:42.518 --> 10:44.258
You want to frisk me?

10:49.691 --> 10:52.103
I should have told you
about all this. I'm sorry.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.609
ljust, uh--

10:54.780 --> 10:57.362
I want to keep you
separate from this.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.775
Safe.
You understand?

11:00.953 --> 11:02.944
Yeah.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.622
| just want to help.

11:04.790 --> 11:07.031
Well, you can.
Tomorrow.

11:07.209 --> 11:10.042
I want you with us
when we go and meet Rick.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.454
He tries anything,
you can talk some sense into him.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.838
Tries anything?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.215
Well, you trust them,
I don't.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.798
Understood.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.088
I'll be there.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.019
You take this one.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.308
(walker growling )

11:34.486 --> 11:36.442
You need the practice.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.326
Just relax.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.409
How am I gonna relax
if you keep telling me to relax?

11:53.839 --> 11:55.329
Wasn't even close.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.247
- You want to do this?
- l have been.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.425
(gunshot)

12:01.597 --> 12:03.838
You're wasting ammo.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.392
(gunshot)

12:14.651 --> 12:16.437
- ( gunshot)
- Got him.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.477
Nice shot.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.522
( laughs)

12:21.700 --> 12:24.112
Hey, large pack
of walkers was spotted

12:24.286 --> 12:25.947
heading for the main wall.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.988
Martinez wants some help.
I got this covered.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.872
We're not supposed
to leave this post.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.829
Ask Martinez.
I'm just doing what I'm told.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.460
You got to bring him over.
We need to hear it from him.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.587
- You're wasting time.
- Sasha: Why can't you handle it?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.294
You're supposed
to be a good shot.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.051
- What are you doing?
- Got to get out of here.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.965
- Nobody leaves.
- Please, I don't want any trouble.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.226
- What is this about?
- Just get out of my way.

12:51.396 --> 12:55.014
- Don't.
- Relax.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.808
Nobody's got
to get hurt here.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.607
I'm sorry.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.319
I'm sorry, it'sjust
this place is--

13:05.994 --> 13:07.950
- I can't stay here.
- Why?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.612
The Governor, he is not
what he seems to be.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.998
- He seems pretty straight up to me.
- That's what I thought, too.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.659
But I'm telling you,
he has done terrible things.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.668
He's planning worse.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.216
I've got to get out of here
and you should, too.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.171
Look, you're rattled,
exhausted.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.461
Just put the knife down.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.847
I'm going.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.145
Okay.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.662
We shouldn't have
let her go.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.412
What do you want me
to do, shoot her?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.380
- You should have stopped her.
- Stop her how?

14:05.554 --> 14:07.340
- Shoot her in the back?
- No, you did the right thing.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.879
Thank God neither
of you were hurt.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.298
We stand on that wall
to stop biters,

14:11.476 --> 14:13.592
not keep people in.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.682
This isn't
a prison camp, is it?

14:16.857 --> 14:20.065
Of course not. lt'sjust she's in no
shape to take care of herself.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.396
Seems pretty capable to me.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.317
She was out there
all winter

14:26.491 --> 14:28.948
alone.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.032
Can you imagine?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.750
Now, you two had each other
or your friends.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.502
She only had the biters.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.795
We brought her in
and tried to help her,

14:45.969 --> 14:47.300
but it was too late.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.008
She'd been out there
too long.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.225
Did she--
did she say anything?

14:58.982 --> 15:00.722
- Like what?
- I don't know.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.562
Like what panicked her?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.819
No.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.150
I hope this
doesn't affect us.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.623
What do you mean?

15:15.791 --> 15:18.783
Well, we heard she was
with that prison group.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.667
I hope I didn't
complicate things.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.749
No. No.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.586
Um, look,
I'll tell you what.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.797
Martinez here could use
a hand with something.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.962
If you wouldn't mind
helping him out, I'd appreciate it.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.517
- Of course.
- Thank you.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.268
( door opens)

15:46.696 --> 15:48.687
Is she gone?

15:50.659 --> 15:52.320
They going after her?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.984
No.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.153
lam.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.744
Oh.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.624
You have a problem
with that, too?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.213
Let her go.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.590
Why would I do that?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.671
She just wants
to be with her people.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.464
You talked to her?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.803
No.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.052
You did.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.688
You knew she was leaving,
didn't you?

16:23.859 --> 16:25.895
She told me.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.645
What else did you two
talk about, huh?

16:29.823 --> 16:32.815
Did you tell her
about the deal?

16:32.993 --> 16:36.577
Did you tell her
about Michonne?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.908
She knows, doesn't she?

16:50.594 --> 16:53.677
( panting )

16:53.847 --> 16:56.338
(walkers growling )

17:05.650 --> 17:06.765
Hey.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.934
Be ready to roll
in a few.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.148
Where to?

17:11.323 --> 17:13.314
We're not going
after that girl, are we?

17:13.491 --> 17:15.322
What if we were?
Is that a problem?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.279
She was pretty shook up.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.990
She definitely
didn't want to be here.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.247
Look, she's on her own,
understood?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.578
We got something else.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.368
It's sort of
hard to explain.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.707
Just be at the truck
in five.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.248
- Okay.
- What girl?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.132
Andreajumped the wall.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.885
On your watch?
And you let her go?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.593
Hey, man, these guys
have been talking.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.098
She's trouble.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.054
Maybe she's not
the issue.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.517
She said some
pretty crazy shit.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.808
You know why?
'Cause she's crazy.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.443
Hey, don't screw this
up for us.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.230
- I'm just looking out.
- For you two, maybe.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.490
What the hell
are you talking about?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.322
We got a good thing here.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.987
I don't want to get
tossed out because of you.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.370
These guys are on edge.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.250
They've been attacked
by that crazy-ass cowboy

18:08.421 --> 18:09.376
and some chick with a sword.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.753
Shit's going down
and you're making waves.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.835
We just have to get
with the program.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.170
lam.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.427
That guy
doesn't trust you.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.553
Do not screw this up.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.976
Ease back, man.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.010
Or what?

18:25.188 --> 18:27.850
You need to shame me
in front of my boy again?

18:28.024 --> 18:30.481
Don't go there, man.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.064
Donna...

18:33.238 --> 18:35.445
ljust happened
to be there.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.072
- It could have been anyone.
- But it wasn't, was it?

18:38.243 --> 18:41.030
- It was you.
- You want to do this now?

18:41.204 --> 18:43.661
A long time coming.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.198
You guys catch up.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.116
Come on, Ben.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.498
Yeah, it was me.
I saved her life.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.587
Right place, right time.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.218
And from that moment, she was
glued to you like a lost puppy.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.880
Her knight
in shining armor.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.140
It made me feel like...

19:06.062 --> 19:08.314
- I could have done it.
- I know you could've.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.096
- She didn't.
- Of course she did.

19:10.275 --> 19:13.642
She knew that.
She was just scared, that's all.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.571
This ain't got nothing
to do with you or me.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.859
Yo, I said five.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.868
Let's go.
Fire it up.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.495
We ain't done.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.826
(engine starts)

19:29.919 --> 19:32.410
( panting )

19:35.925 --> 19:37.665
(car approaching )

19:58.782 --> 20:01.194
( exhales )

20:03.328 --> 20:06.240
( breathing heavily )

20:08.375 --> 20:10.115
(snarling )

20:34.901 --> 20:36.357
(grunts)

20:47.580 --> 20:49.081
Shit.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.998
(walkers snarling )

21:01.511 --> 21:02.796
Sasha:
What is that?

21:02.971 --> 21:04.632
Martinez:
Jackpot, baby.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.672
This some kind
of extermination?

21:07.851 --> 21:10.308
You could say that.
No weeding out today, Shump.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.514
- The more the merrier.
- All right.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.805
You got a use for them?

21:14.983 --> 21:16.439
Honey, we got a use
for everything.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.437
This got something to do
with that meeting tomorrow?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.116
The one with the prison group?

21:24.284 --> 21:27.742
Ho, ho, ho.
Get that man a prize.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.574
- You're bringing biters?
- Allen, heads up.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.363
Okay, this is genius.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.284
Hey, kid, grab the collars
out of the truck.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.293
This ain't right.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.079
Didn't think we were gonna
have any problems today, fella.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.872
I didn't think we'd be
feeding people to biters.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.666
What do you care?
They're rats.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.585
This is sick.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.470
Hey, give me a hand here.
Ty, you deaf?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.677
I'm not doing this.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.638
They got women
and children.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.143
You can't do this.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.520
Fine, suit yourself.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.476
We get back,
you tell the Governor.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.902
He'll send you packing.
Send you all packing.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.481
- There's no need for that.
- Relax.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.442
We looked out for each other.
We'll do it again.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.279
We'll get out of your way
if that's what you want.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.613
You don't speak for us.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.573
You're not sending my boy
out there again.

22:11.748 --> 22:15.240
- I look out for him.
- Like you looked out for Donna?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.664
(grunts)

22:20.632 --> 22:22.668
- Sasha: Tyreese!
- Leave him alone!

22:22.842 --> 22:24.673
Get off me!

22:27.388 --> 22:29.344
Do it.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.095
Go on!

22:37.023 --> 22:38.763
Please.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.987
Go on!

22:51.246 --> 22:53.362
You okay?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.581
(clapping )

22:57.752 --> 22:59.413
You've all been
very productive.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.418
Shump,
take 'em back to town.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.966
Let 'em do some knitting.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.638
( breathing heavily )

23:33.288 --> 23:35.825
(engine rewing)

23:56.227 --> 23:59.014
(engine rewing)

24:09.866 --> 24:12.198
(horn honking)

24:45.443 --> 24:48.230
( panting )

25:01.125 --> 25:03.161
(engine revs)

25:51.217 --> 25:54.084
(engine rewing)

26:01.811 --> 26:03.642
- ( clatters )
- Shit.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.179
(engine revs)

26:12.864 --> 26:14.650
(engine turns off)

26:14.824 --> 26:16.815
( car door slams)

26:47.732 --> 26:50.189
( clatters )

27:00.995 --> 27:04.283
( metal clanking )

27:04.457 --> 27:07.244
(whistling)

27:17.136 --> 27:18.717
(snarling )

27:18.888 --> 27:20.298
( fence rattles )

28:07.979 --> 28:10.561
( quietly )
Andrea.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.523
Come back with me.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.855
Come back to Woodbury.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.735
We need you.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.192
We all need you.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.163
( louder)
That's your home now.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.953
Your people.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.173
Your town.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.299
You can'tjust leave
'em all behind.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.766
Please, Andrea,
come home.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.188
Suit yourself.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.911
( glass shattering )

29:38.694 --> 29:41.401
( rattling )

30:02.593 --> 30:05.300
(whistling)

30:22.029 --> 30:25.112
(shovel scraping )

30:42.842 --> 30:45.333
( clattering )

31:07.867 --> 31:10.734
(snarling )

31:23.424 --> 31:25.665
(gunshot)

31:27.178 --> 31:28.839
(gunshot)

31:33.100 --> 31:35.216
(snarling )

31:45.154 --> 31:47.270
(shovel banging )

31:50.409 --> 31:53.025
( fence rattles )

32:17.520 --> 32:20.227
( footsteps )

32:20.397 --> 32:23.059
(snarling )

32:26.153 --> 32:29.441
(snarling echoing )

33:04.233 --> 33:06.394
Time to go home, huh?

33:09.280 --> 33:10.861
Andrea.

33:13.701 --> 33:15.817
(snarling )

33:15.995 --> 33:17.951
(grunts)

33:33.387 --> 33:35.799
( gunshots)

33:40.728 --> 33:43.014
(gunshots continue)

33:55.409 --> 33:57.570
Come on!
Come on!

34:09.340 --> 34:12.548
( Governor screaming )

36:14.882 --> 36:16.418
Shh.

36:43.327 --> 36:44.908
Yeah.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.990
Shh.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.768
(snarling )

37:50.227 --> 37:52.218
Did you find her?

37:52.396 --> 37:54.057
No luck.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.392
Just got word.
Someone barbecued the pit biters.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.057
Who?

37:58.235 --> 38:00.100
Got a few shit stirrers
in the bunch.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.894
Tyreese and his sister.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.313
Send them over to distro.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.447
- Rest of the group, too.
- All right.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.904
We're still gonna need biters,
so get some more.

38:09.079 --> 38:11.161
You got it.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.619
( door opens)

38:20.048 --> 38:21.879
Sorry to keep you waiting.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.301
Did you find her?

38:23.469 --> 38:25.835
No.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.550
Hardly made it
back myself.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.849
I'll look again tomorrow.

38:34.605 --> 38:38.143
So I heard there was
a little hang-up at the pits.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.649
You got a beef with Rick,
that's fair enough.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.731
But you can't be feeding
his kids to biters.

38:43.906 --> 38:45.692
No one's feeding anyone
to biters.

38:45.866 --> 38:49.154
Well, I saw the trailers.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.570
It's a scare tactic.
It's a bluff.

38:52.748 --> 38:55.956
I'd rather scare his people
into leaving us alone

38:56.126 --> 38:58.412
than engaging
in another fight.

38:58.587 --> 39:00.794
I'm trying
to save lives here.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.915
They're just for show?

39:05.093 --> 39:07.550
You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

39:07.721 --> 39:09.712
than a gun in their face.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.223
It's pretty effective.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.974
Then why didn't your man
just say that?

39:19.358 --> 39:21.644
'Cause...

39:21.818 --> 39:23.683
we don't discuss
tactics with people

39:23.862 --> 39:26.239
that we don't really know.

39:38.085 --> 39:41.202
( sighs )
Governor, look.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.462
I shoot my mouth off
sometimes,

39:43.632 --> 39:46.339
but the truth is
we want to stay.

39:47.844 --> 39:51.382
I saw red.
It won't happen again.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.970
Well, I'm glad
to hear it.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.359
Where did you get
the gasoline?

40:11.952 --> 40:14.034
Come again?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.203
Doesn't matter.

40:42.149 --> 40:44.310
Is she dead?

40:44.484 --> 40:46.736
I hope not.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.695
Are you okay?

40:50.866 --> 40:53.403
Never been better.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.572
It's a real shame
about the pits.

41:01.293 --> 41:04.205
You heard about that, huh?

41:04.379 --> 41:07.212
I hope you find out
who did it.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.790
Already have.

41:24.650 --> 41:27.016
(music playing )

41:43.460 --> 41:48.295
J‘ Stood at the edge
of the valley J‘

41:49.633 --> 41:53.842
J‘ Looked at
the ground below J‘

41:55.722 --> 42:00.261
J‘ Oh, I was surrounded J‘

42:01.937 --> 42:06.101
J‘ There's nowhere
left to go J‘

42:07.442 --> 42:09.979
J‘ There's a wolf in
my heart J‘

42:10.153 --> 42:13.236
J‘ There's a wolf
in my heart J‘

42:13.407 --> 42:14.943
J‘ For you J‘

42:16.368 --> 42:19.075
J‘ For you J‘

42:19.246 --> 42:21.111
J‘ For you. J‘

42:22.958 --> 42:22.992
(theme music playing )

42:22.999 --> 42:25.411
(theme music playing )
