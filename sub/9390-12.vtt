You see, Peter?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.440
This is a much better way
to spend a Sunday

00:42.442 --> 00:44.342
than what you
dragged us to last week.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.944
Hey, if I'm starring
in a production

00:45.946 --> 00:48.513
of Starlight Express, I
want my whole family there.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.149
Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!

00:51.151 --> 00:54.052
Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!

00:54.054 --> 00:56.154
Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!

00:56.156 --> 00:58.356
Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!

00:58.358 --> 00:59.290
Starlight Express!

00:59.292 --> 01:01.326
(angrily):
Starlight Express!

01:01.328 --> 01:02.894
Starlight Express!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.829
Starlight Express!

01:04.831 --> 01:07.232
Starlight Express!

01:07.234 --> 01:08.967
Starlight Express!

01:09.368 --> 01:11.302
(muttering):
Starlight Express.

01:15.841 --> 01:17.475
(gasps)
Stewie, look.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.277
A butterfly.

01:20.279 --> 01:21.980
Let's get it!

01:21.982 --> 01:22.747
(laughing)

01:22.749 --> 01:26.284
Uh, Chris, I don't think we
should be leaving the trail.

01:26.652 --> 01:29.287
(with English accent):
I shall put you
in a glass box

01:29.289 --> 01:31.122
to display on
Saint Trimmings Day.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.023
Awww.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.459
British guys always
capture my butterflies.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.561
Yes, and to add
insult to injury,

01:36.563 --> 01:38.797
I shall present
to you my fanny:

01:38.799 --> 01:40.532
Sir Chadwell Heath.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.934
(laughing)

01:44.203 --> 01:45.070
Aw, darn it.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.440
Hey, wait a second.
Where are we?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.208
Oh, no.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.142
Hey, Chris,
did you know

01:51.144 --> 01:54.345
your bacne spells
"Citibank" in Braille?

01:57.917 --> 02:00.351
Great. You had
to chase the butterfly.

02:00.353 --> 02:03.021
Yes, I had to chase
the butterfly.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.556
I came out here
to observe nature.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.057
What did you come
out here for?

02:06.059 --> 02:09.060
I came to the woods because
I wished to live deliberately,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.930
and see if I could not learn
what it had to teach,

02:11.932 --> 02:13.865
and not, when I came to die,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.800
discover that I had not lived.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.303
Wow, Stewie.
That was beautiful.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.004
Did you write that?
No.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.173
But can you tell me who did?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.342
Log on now.

02:26.545 --> 02:29.481
All right,
let's tally up those responses.

02:32.017 --> 02:32.383
Wow.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.385
You know who that is?
You know who Thornton Mellon--

02:34.387 --> 02:35.754
First of all,
it was Henry David Thoreau.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.021
But do you know
who Thornton Mellon is?

02:37.023 --> 02:40.492
That was Rodney Dangerfield's
character in <i>Back to School.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:42.927
You feel good about yourselves?
Huh?

02:42.929 --> 02:45.497
This is why the other countries
are beating us, you know!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.398
So you know,
you got only yourself to blame

02:47.400 --> 02:49.167
next time you go
to the vet and complain

02:49.169 --> 02:52.237
that that Indian doctor
is too rough with your cat.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.439
(sobbing)

02:54.441 --> 02:58.109
Stewie,
are we gonna die?

02:58.111 --> 02:59.677
Hey, hey.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.645
Probably.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.680
I-I don't want to die!

03:02.682 --> 03:05.083
You know, Chris,
if by some miracle,

03:05.085 --> 03:06.651
we do manage to get
out of here alive,

03:06.653 --> 03:09.087
I'm gonna finally run
for public office again.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.223
I think people have forgotten
my last embarrassment.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.461
Harry Truman.
Stupid jerk.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.563
Freakin' FDR's ass bitch.

03:18.565 --> 03:19.931
If we get back home alive,

03:19.933 --> 03:23.168
I'm gonna finally open up
to Ellen from my math class

03:23.170 --> 03:24.502
and tell her
how much I like her.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.372
I'd like those things
for us, Chris.

03:29.308 --> 03:30.375
What are you doing?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.976
I'm digging a hole.

03:31.978 --> 03:32.443
Why?

03:32.445 --> 03:35.180
'Cause I like to
sleep on my side.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.289
Our top story: The search
for two local boys

03:44.291 --> 03:46.991
lost in the woods drags
on into its third day.

03:46.993 --> 03:47.959
That's right, Diane.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.128
Still no sign of Chris
and Stewie Griffin.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.996
Here's the update
from the local authorities

03:51.998 --> 03:53.464
who are overseeing
the search party's efforts.

03:53.466 --> 03:56.267
We're still very optimistic that
we're gonna find these kids,

03:56.269 --> 03:59.470
and we just want to urge
everyone not to give up hope.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.405
All right, everyone,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.607
we are officially
looking for corpses.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.043
Repeat: this is now
a recovery effort.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.111
We are officially
looking for corpses,

04:07.113 --> 04:08.279
so let's get
back out there,

04:08.281 --> 04:10.148
bring back
those dead bodies.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.449
Oh, God,
this is horrible!

04:11.451 --> 04:12.951
I can't watch anymore!

04:12.953 --> 04:15.486
Mom, Daddy, thank you
so much for coming over.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.888
Oh, of course, dear.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.356
I don't know
what to do.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.524
They scoured the area,

04:19.526 --> 04:20.658
and there's
no sign of them.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.727
I feel like I can't just
sit here doing nothing,

04:22.729 --> 04:24.462
but I don't know
what I can do.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.397
I'll tell you who
could help. Medium.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.099
Daddy, that's not
a real person.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.601
That's a character
on a TV show.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.536
Don't you
disparage Medium.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.370
Medium works
very hard.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.739
You know, Mom, I saw this thing
on the Discovery Channel

04:34.741 --> 04:37.842
about psychics who help
find people who are lost.

04:37.844 --> 04:38.309
Really?

04:38.311 --> 04:39.677
I saw this thing on
the Discovery Channel

04:39.679 --> 04:41.579
about this fat woman
who sat on her dog

04:41.581 --> 04:44.415
and it went up
inside her guts.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.286
It's been three days,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.555
and I just don't know
where else to turn.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.223
Please, can you help me?

04:52.225 --> 04:53.258
Don't worry, Lois.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.595
The spirit world wants
very much to assist you.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.964
Your missing sons will be found.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.534
Oh, oh! Thank you!
Thank you so much!

05:03.536 --> 05:06.237
I can't tell you how
reassuring that is.

05:06.239 --> 05:10.241
Ah. My babies are okay.

05:11.377 --> 05:14.379
Will you answer
one question for me?

05:14.381 --> 05:15.313
Yes.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.649
Thank you so much.

05:21.787 --> 05:25.089
Well, Stewie,
I think we're finished.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.058
It sure looks that way.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.194
It's been a pleasure
serving with you, Chris.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.330
And with you, Stewie.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.532
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey, come back!

05:34.534 --> 05:35.733
It's gonna get dark soon!

05:35.735 --> 05:39.037
All this drama over
a turkey burger?!

05:39.039 --> 05:40.071
(gasps)

05:40.073 --> 05:41.439
Oh, thank God!

05:41.441 --> 05:42.273
Oh, you're
not Jeffrey.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.575
You're that
missing baby and boy.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.543
(gasps)
Jeffrey!

05:45.545 --> 05:47.779
I found that
missing baby and boy!

05:47.781 --> 05:50.248
JEFFREY:
I don't care.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.783
(gasps)

05:51.785 --> 05:53.217
CHRIS/STEWIE:
Mommy!

05:53.219 --> 05:54.719
Chris!
Stewie!

05:54.721 --> 05:55.620
My babies!

05:55.622 --> 05:58.523
Oh, I'm so happy
you're safe!

05:58.525 --> 06:00.325
Oh, I knew
they'd find you.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.659
I knew you were okay.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.127
It's just like
the psychic said.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.730
Thank you all
for your help, everybody.

06:05.732 --> 06:06.497
Oh, for definite.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.300
It's just like a childhood
game of Hide and Find!

06:09.302 --> 06:10.468
You said it, friend!

06:10.470 --> 06:11.602
What do you say
for celebration,

06:11.604 --> 06:13.471
we go dunk our whistles
in the trough?

06:13.473 --> 06:15.773
Ah! We should
totally phone Gaspard!

06:15.775 --> 06:17.475
Ah! He would love
to hear this tale!

06:17.477 --> 06:21.479
Oh, but I only have 15 pfenigs
on my phone card.

06:21.481 --> 06:24.082
Happy Gerbitz Day.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.216
Ah!
Ah! Ah!

06:25.218 --> 06:26.751
Ah!
Ah!

06:30.723 --> 06:35.293
Oh, it is so good to have my
boys back home safe and sound.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.294
Thank God for that psychic.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.396
What are you talking about?
The psychic didn't do anything.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.832
Well, she said we were gonna
find them and we did.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.600
I always wondered
about psychics,

06:42.602 --> 06:44.435
but I gotta tell ya,
I'm a believer now.

06:44.437 --> 06:48.072
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and see
what else she has to say.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.141
Hey, check it out.
Chris and Stewie,

06:50.143 --> 06:52.343
you're on the front page
of the paper.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.445
You know, Chris,
that girl from school

06:54.447 --> 06:55.646
sees that picture
and you're in.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.682
Look, Stewie, I'm not
really gonna ask her out.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.685
I think that just might have
been cocky forest talk.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.787
No, but you got to
take advantage of this.

07:02.789 --> 07:03.654
Seize your moment.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.223
Like the
Duck Founding Father.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.192
Gentlemen, these are all
important fundamental rights,

07:08.194 --> 07:11.529
but I move we strike the right
to bob for small fish

07:11.531 --> 07:13.798
with your butt in the air.
All in favor?

07:13.800 --> 07:14.732
ALL:
Aye.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.768
Opposed?
(duck quacks)

07:16.770 --> 07:18.369
The motion carries.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.740
I don't know about
this, Stewie.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.275
Nonsense.
You're a hero now.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.143
Your picture's
in the paper.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.813
She'll be fawning
all over you.
Now, which one is she?

07:28.815 --> 07:30.214
There.

07:33.252 --> 07:34.285
Hi, Chris!

07:34.287 --> 07:36.320
Wait a minute.
That's the girl?

07:36.322 --> 07:38.289
Yeah. Isn't she special?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.258
That's the way the state
of Rhode Island would put it.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.694
Uh, there's something...
up with her, isn't there?

07:43.696 --> 07:45.663
Yeah. She's got
Down syndrome.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.131
Oh, okay,
well, there we go.

07:47.133 --> 07:47.832
She's so sweet.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.935
And doesn't she have
the most beautiful eyes?

07:50.937 --> 07:52.637
Well, the spacing
seems a tad off,

07:52.639 --> 07:54.372
but, yeah, individually,
they're not awful.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.774
All right, I'm on board.
Go talk to her.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.244
Um, hi, Ellen.

08:00.246 --> 08:00.745
Hi, Chris.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.581
Um, this is my
little brother Stewie.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.850
(chuckles)
Your head makes me laugh.

08:05.852 --> 08:09.821
I'm guessing this one owned
a bunny, but not anymore.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.421
(thuds)

08:10.423 --> 08:13.791
Um, listen there's something
I've wanted to tell you

08:13.793 --> 08:15.827
for a really long time.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.994
Oh, yeah? What?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.964
Well, um... I
really like you.

08:19.966 --> 08:20.731
(laughs)

08:20.733 --> 08:22.834
And I was wondering
if maybe, um...

08:22.836 --> 08:25.403
you want to go out
on a date with me.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.339
Okay. Pick me up
Saturday at 8:00.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.907
Great.
See you then.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.009
There you go.
Being confident.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.746
Like an Italian guy in
any given theoretical situation.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.514
If that was me...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.649
I'm, I'm just saying,
if that was me...

08:38.651 --> 08:40.718
They are lucky
that was not me.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.887
Because, if the
circumstances were such,

08:42.889 --> 08:44.889
as you have
described them,

08:44.891 --> 08:45.623
but with me in them,

08:45.625 --> 08:48.626
that's a very different
and scary outcome

08:48.628 --> 08:49.961
for those involved.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.762
If.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.800
Oh, my God, Brian.

08:55.802 --> 08:56.801
Oh... my... God.

08:56.803 --> 08:57.735
Whoa. What is it?
What happened?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.370
I just went to see
my psychic Estelle,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.906
and she told me
that Stewie is gonna grow up

09:01.908 --> 09:03.508
to be very successful.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.842
Ah! Isn't that
great news?

09:04.844 --> 09:06.777
You went to see
that psychic again?

09:06.779 --> 09:07.979
That's the third
time this week.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.680
She's a lifesaver, Brian.

09:09.682 --> 09:12.283
She gives me the confidence
to live my life,

09:12.285 --> 09:13.851
knowing I'm making
the right choices.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.654
Wow, and she does
all this for free?

09:16.656 --> 09:17.688
No, she charges me.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.724
She charges you?!
Well, that's weird.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.294
Why would you pay her to
hear things you want to hear?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.029
I'm not crazy about
your tone, Brian.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.665
Well, I just think you're
being taken for a ride, Lois.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.501
Like a snail on the
back of a turtle.

09:31.904 --> 09:32.537
Slow down!

09:32.539 --> 09:36.440
I want to get there,
but I want to get there alive!

09:37.943 --> 09:40.545
Mom, why do I have
to take a bath with Stewie?

09:40.547 --> 09:43.948
Because, Meg, Estelle told me
that someone in the family

09:43.950 --> 09:44.982
was in danger of drowning,

09:44.984 --> 09:47.451
and that I should take
some steps to prevent it.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.888
So, from now on,
everybody has a bath buddy.

09:50.890 --> 09:51.923
Hey, Meg, watch.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.424
(farts,
bubbling behind)

09:53.426 --> 09:54.058
(both laugh)

09:54.060 --> 09:56.527
(farts, bubbling behind)
(both laugh)

09:56.529 --> 09:58.963
(bubbling in front)

09:58.965 --> 10:00.932
(screaming)

10:04.136 --> 10:04.635
What am I gonna do?

10:04.637 --> 10:07.471
I'm really nervous about
my date with Ellen tonight.

10:07.473 --> 10:11.742
I mean, I want to impress her,
but what if I mess things up?

10:11.744 --> 10:13.578
Oh, come on, Chris,
it's just a matter

10:13.580 --> 10:14.445
of getting off
on the right foot.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.282
First things first.

Okay, Brian,
I'm here.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.255
Now, what is it
you want?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.890
All right, look, Lois,
this psychic nonsense

13:45.892 --> 13:48.058
has gone too far, so I'm
going to prove to you

13:48.060 --> 13:51.028
that there is no such thing
as someone who is psychic,

13:51.030 --> 13:52.930
and that with the
most minimal training

13:52.932 --> 13:54.198
and the right set
of buzzwords,

13:54.200 --> 13:55.866
anyone can appear
to be psychic.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.202
Even a complete boob
like Peter. Watch this.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.937
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm psychic,

13:59.939 --> 14:01.972
and I'm getting
a strong feeling from you.

14:01.974 --> 14:05.109
Do you have a watch or clock
that no longer works?

14:05.111 --> 14:07.978
W-Wow. I used to have
a watch that broke.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.648
You see, just by asking
very general questions

14:10.650 --> 14:11.782
that would apply
to most people,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.785
a person can appear to have
inside knowledge about you.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.288
I'm also sensing
that you have a dead relative.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.757
My husband died of
cancer last year.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.591
Oh, my God. Awesome.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.526
Okay, uh, I'm sensing
some other bad stuff.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.728
My daughter was just
in an accident.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.097
Sweet! High five!
(gasps)
You're awful.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.199
Hey, you don't want
to hear the truth,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.968
don't come to the park.
(sighs) Okay.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.069
Okay, you made your point.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.972
I get it.
Maybe I went
a little overboard

14:34.974 --> 14:36.240
with the things
Estelle told me.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.676
All right, look,
can we just go home now?

14:38.678 --> 14:40.044
Come on, Peter.
Let's go.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.779
Brian, I felt
something.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.582
Just now, talking to
that bitch cancer widow.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.350
I think I may
have a gift.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.719
Peter, we were just doing
a demonstration.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.321
No, Brian.
This is real.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.756
I believe
I am psychic.

14:52.758 --> 14:53.724
My first prediction:

14:53.726 --> 14:58.162
I am either going to fly
or ruin that family's picnic.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.798
Hey! You've ruined
our picnic!

15:00.800 --> 15:02.933
Psychic.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.242
Peter, what are
you doing?
Quiet, Brian.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.910
I'm performing
a psychic reading.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.779
Peter, for the last time,
you're not psychic.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.047
I most certainly am.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.149
All right, Quagmire,
clear your mi...

15:19.151 --> 15:20.284
Ooh, soft hands.

15:20.286 --> 15:20.951
Clear your mind,

15:20.953 --> 15:23.220
remove all traces
of unease and doubt,

15:23.222 --> 15:26.657
and I will tell you
your future.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.625
What is it, Peter?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.093
You will die
in a plane crash

15:29.095 --> 15:32.162
and be reincarnated
as a prophylactic.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.099
All right!

15:35.101 --> 15:37.268
No, no,
not all right!

15:39.170 --> 15:42.006
Well, I'm glad we're
finally going out, Ellen.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.174
I've really liked you
for a long time.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.844
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing?

15:46.846 --> 15:47.912
Sitting down.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.080
Get up and pull my
chair out for me.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.715
Oh, goodness, I'm sorry.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.717
(chuckling):
I'm so sorry.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.286
That's better.

15:55.854 --> 15:58.055
You going to be this
rude all evening?

15:58.057 --> 16:01.325
You haven't asked me
anything about myself.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.860
Oh. Um, sorry.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.362
Um, uh, so... so,
what do your parents do?

16:05.364 --> 16:06.297
That's better.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.264
My dad's an accountant,

16:07.266 --> 16:10.868
and my mom is the former
governor of Alaska.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.269
Oh, that's cool.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.103
It's real cool.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.039
Now, get up,
come over here,

16:15.041 --> 16:17.575
and give me a
shoulder massage.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.242
Okay.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.245
Boy, you're tougher
than a doggy dominatrix.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.113
Do it, do it.
Come on, do it.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.682
Do it, do it.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.817
Aah, yes!

16:26.819 --> 16:29.119
Yes! Aah, you bitch!

16:29.121 --> 16:30.754
Aah!

16:35.360 --> 16:36.994
Oh, my God, this is awful.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.163
There's got to be
200 people here.

16:44.836 --> 16:45.736
Thank you.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.237
Thank you so much for coming.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.472
Thank... (gasps) Hold on.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.007
I'm sensing something psychic.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.676
Ma'am, did you have
a female relative

16:52.678 --> 16:54.912
who's passed on
to the other side

16:54.914 --> 16:57.081
named, um, um...

16:57.083 --> 16:59.049
Polly?
Polly!
I said it first.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.851
That was amazing.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.519
I've never seen a bad show
at the Marriott.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.056
Oh, my God, they're all
falling for this insanity.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.825
I'm sensing a black guy
over here.

17:07.827 --> 17:08.926
Is there a black guy?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.427
Me! I'm a black guy.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.296
(crowd oohing and aahing)

17:12.298 --> 17:12.963
Yes, good, good.

17:12.965 --> 17:16.033
I'm sensing your infant daughter
has earrings.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.868
He's right. She does.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.069
(applause)

17:19.071 --> 17:21.639
Peter, you got to
stop this right now.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.272
Shut up, Lois.

17:22.274 --> 17:23.374
Don't mess up
my psychic-ness.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.376
I'm sensing a doctor
in the audience.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.810
Where is the doctor?

17:26.812 --> 17:27.745
I'm a doctor.

17:27.747 --> 17:28.879
Okay. Your great grandmother

17:28.881 --> 17:30.781
is contacting me right now,
and she wants to know

17:30.783 --> 17:33.584
if this rash looks like
it's going to go away.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.185
Well, I-I-I guess

17:35.187 --> 17:36.720
I'd tell her to use Bactine.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.455
No! She says Bactine hurts.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.958
She wants something
more soothing.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.092
(audience gasps)

17:42.094 --> 17:43.861
Peter, we need your help.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.362
We just got word
of a kidnap victim

17:45.364 --> 17:48.132
buried alive with a bomb
strapped to his chest.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.366
We need your psychic powers

17:49.368 --> 17:52.336
to lead us to him
before the bomb goes off.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.170
Well, well.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.439
Finally, a true test
of my abilities.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.074
You came
to the right place, Joe.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.842
I'll psych
that guy out for you.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.044
Peter,
you can't do this.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.311
All right, I mean,
it-it's one thing

18:01.313 --> 18:03.414
to take money
from a bunch of suckers,

18:03.416 --> 18:04.281
but this is serious.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.582
You're a fraud.
I am not.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.518
I'll tell you who's
a fraud: Mr. Spock.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.087
Mr. Sulu, set a course for...
One moment,
Captain.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.389
They're about to announce
the winning numbers

18:12.391 --> 18:13.590
for the Intergalactic
Lottery.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.993
FEMALE VOICE:
Today's winning numbers are:

18:20.532 --> 18:22.199
Ah, yes!

18:22.201 --> 18:23.467
You're damn right!

18:23.469 --> 18:24.468
Hell, yeah!

18:24.470 --> 18:25.402
You can suck it.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.438
You can suck it.
You can suck it.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.106
You can all suck it!

18:29.108 --> 18:31.175
Live long and suck it!

18:33.211 --> 18:34.044
Well, Ellen, I had

18:34.046 --> 18:36.246
a really interesting time
with you tonight.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.382
I guess I'll talk
to you soon.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.383
You're not leaving yet.

18:39.385 --> 18:43.320
I need somebody to make
me an ice cream sundae,

18:43.322 --> 18:45.055
so get in the house.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.057
Okay, okay.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.329
Uh, unless you're going
to pull a sundae

18:52.331 --> 18:53.363
out of your belly button,

18:53.365 --> 18:57.000
I'd get your ass
in the (bleep) kitchen.

18:57.002 --> 18:57.968
Oh, boy.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.904
My dogs are mooing today.

19:01.239 --> 19:03.474
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.274
What's the matter?

19:04.276 --> 19:06.210
Did I say put
chocolate sauce on there?

19:06.212 --> 19:09.513
Did you hear me say
put chocolate sauce on there?

19:09.515 --> 19:11.415
Well, I... I just
thought that...

19:11.417 --> 19:12.116
You thought what?

19:12.118 --> 19:14.852
You know, if you want
access to this temple,

19:14.854 --> 19:17.354
you'd better pay
the proper tribute.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.056
All right, that is it!

19:19.058 --> 19:20.724
I don't care
how hot you are.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.293
I don't much like being
treated this way.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.996
You know, I used to hear
that people with Down syndrome

19:25.998 --> 19:28.432
were different than the
rest of us, but you're not.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.900
You're not different at all.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.270
You're just a bunch of (bleep)
like everyone else!

19:33.272 --> 19:35.939
I got bad news for you, buddy.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.341
You just blew it.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.943
Get out of my house now!

19:44.883 --> 19:45.549
How'd it go?

19:45.551 --> 19:47.584
Looks like I totally
screwed that up.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.019
No, you didn't. You made a vow

19:49.021 --> 19:51.488
that you were going to ask
Ellen out, and you did.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.856
That took courage, my friend.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.025
Especially for a poor,
timid sap like you.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.261
I'm proud of you.
Thanks, Stewie.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.463
I'm just sorry I never got
to make out with her.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.299
Oh, she would have crushed
your scrote into a diamond

20:02.301 --> 20:03.300
with her
robot-strength hand.

20:03.302 --> 20:06.236
Come on, let's get
out of here.

20:07.238 --> 20:09.006
All right, Peter,
we know the victim

20:09.008 --> 20:10.174
is somewhere
in this area.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.342
We don't have much time
before the bomb...

20:12.344 --> 20:13.343
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.645
Okay, Joe, when I'm
tracking someone,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.313
it often helps
to touch something

20:16.315 --> 20:17.548
that belongs
to the victim.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.016
Does he have a wife?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.884
Yea-Yeah.

20:22.453 --> 20:23.987
Yeah, uh-huh.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.256
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.357
It's still
very fuzzy.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.027
Does he have
a daughter?

20:30.029 --> 20:30.694
Yeah, I see.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.896
Does he have maybe, like,
a thinner, hotter daughter?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.398
Well, yes,
but she's only 12.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.966
Okay. Like-like a...
like a young 12

20:35.968 --> 20:38.268
or, like, a "she eats a
lot of milk products

20:38.270 --> 20:39.436
so she got her
boobs early" 12?

20:39.438 --> 20:40.871
Which is a real
thing, by the way.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.139
Peter, we're running
out of time!

20:42.141 --> 20:43.273
All right, all right,
we'll try something else.

20:43.275 --> 20:47.611
I will now use my psychic powers
to seek help from beyond.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.681
I shall now channel the ghost
of Lou Costello,

20:50.683 --> 20:53.917
who will guide us
to this soul in distress.

20:54.485 --> 20:55.686
Hi, everybody.
It's me, Lou Costello.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.355
All right, what's the name
of the guy we're looking for?

20:58.357 --> 21:00.424
Well, he's an Asian fella--
Melvin Hu.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.192
That's what I want
to find out.
What?

21:02.194 --> 21:03.427
The name of the guy.
Melvin Hu.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.328
Are you a cop?
Yeah.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.362
You handling this case?
Yeah.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.697
Then what's the
name of the guy?
Hu.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.865
The guy we're
looking for.
Hu.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.032
The guy who's buried.
Hu.

21:09.034 --> 21:09.833
The guy with the bomb.
Hu.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.401
What street's
he live on?
First.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.637
(bomb exploding)

21:13.639 --> 21:15.606
Yeah, I'm
not psychic.
