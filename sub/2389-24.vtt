WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:06.021
So?
No.

00:06.023 --> 00:07.756
No. You-You were in.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.508
I said, "Have you met Ted"
and everything.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.126
How could that not work?
I don't know,

00:11.128 --> 00:13.128
we introduced ourselves,
I bought her a drink,

00:13.130 --> 00:14.346
told her I loved her...

00:14.348 --> 00:16.047
What?
I'm kidding.

00:16.050 --> 00:20.018
Hold on, Roxanne-- if that
really is your name.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.854
It's not. It's Robin.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.356
You played "Have You Met Ted"
without me?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.725
In <i>my</i> bar with <i>my</i> Ted?

00:26.727 --> 00:31.063
Maybe stealing a bro's wingman
is okay back in...

00:31.065 --> 00:34.432
I'm sorry, what's the name of
this third world banana republic

00:34.434 --> 00:35.951
you claim to be from?

00:35.953 --> 00:38.603
Canada.

00:38.605 --> 00:41.073
I have literally
never heard of that place.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.741
When'd you move
here, anyway?

00:42.743 --> 00:43.742
Two months ago.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.910
How do you like it?
Honestly,

00:44.912 --> 00:46.578
it-it's been
a little tough.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.465
I moved here for this on-air
reporter job at Metro News 1

00:49.467 --> 00:51.416
thinking it was gonna
be my big break,

00:51.418 --> 00:52.417
only to find out

00:52.419 --> 00:54.119
that our viewership
mostly consists

00:54.121 --> 00:55.304
of DMV waiting rooms

00:55.306 --> 00:57.506
and people plugging in their
TV for the first time.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.293
To top it all off,
I have no friends.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.596
Um... wrong.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.848
You have four friends
right here.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.133
Right, guys?
Uh, yeah.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.935
You're totally in our gang,
now. And once you're in,

01:09.937 --> 01:11.270
you're in for life, right?

01:11.272 --> 01:13.071
She's in.
Oh. All right.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.773
She's in.
Welcome.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.742
Well, if I'm in, I should
get the next round.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.193
Whoa, whoa,
Ooh,

01:18.195 --> 01:19.912
I like this girl.
ho, ho.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.115
I'm serious, I
like this girl.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.817
And we need some estrogen
up in this bitch.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.620
All we ever talk about
is Scotch and sports.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.655
Five Glen McKennas,
21 years, neat.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.708
And switch it
to the hockey game, 'cause

01:32.710 --> 01:35.093
my Canucks are gonna
bury the Bruins, yo.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.045
So here's the deal
with the deal.

01:37.047 --> 01:38.496
Robin's my new
best friend--

01:38.498 --> 01:39.965
nobody bangs her.

01:39.967 --> 01:40.933
Hey, hey,

01:40.935 --> 01:42.217
hey, she only rejected me

01:42.219 --> 01:44.436
three times,
she's still very much in play.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.388
I'm serious.

01:46.390 --> 01:49.858
There's only one way I'd let
either of you have sex with her.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.778
Not that. It's never that.

01:53.646 --> 01:54.730
I really want this girl

01:54.732 --> 01:56.398
to stay a part
of our lives.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.902
So the only way you're allowed
to hook up with her...

01:59.904 --> 02:02.520
is if you marry her.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.957
Too rich for my blood.

02:06.525 --> 02:08.360
That son of a bitch did it.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.662
He really did.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.748
So you're moving
to Chicago tomorrow, huh?

02:12.750 --> 02:14.750
How do you feel?

02:14.752 --> 02:16.635
Uh, I'm looking forward to it.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.003
The job's amazing.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.537
I got a great apartment
lined up.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.807
You know, it's...

02:21.809 --> 02:23.508
It's exciting.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.543
Onwards and upwar...

02:50.588 --> 02:54.172
Hey! Bass player.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.908
It's me. The guy from
the drug store with the diapers

02:56.910 --> 02:58.543
that hit on you,
then we went outside

02:58.545 --> 03:01.546
and had a deep, emotional
talk on a bus bench.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.915
I ...I-I'm gonna be really
surprised if I have to be

03:03.917 --> 03:05.183
more specific than that.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.019
Remember when you

03:07.021 --> 03:08.420
told me to stop
messing around

03:08.422 --> 03:09.587
and go get the girl?

03:09.589 --> 03:12.274
Well, check it. I got her.

03:13.978 --> 03:16.862
What about you?
You still dating that guy?

03:24.654 --> 03:26.538
Grape Scotch

03:26.540 --> 03:28.657
Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.

03:28.659 --> 03:30.125
Right here, right here,
Yeah,

03:30.127 --> 03:31.710
I-I see you, Barney.
right here, right here.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.161
Good, great. Then it's
time to play a little game

03:33.163 --> 03:34.379
I like to call Have...
Yeah,

03:34.381 --> 03:36.298
Barney, I...
No, no.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.300
You are not getting out
of Have You Met Ted.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.551
There's a girl
that you have to meet.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.837
She is perfect for you.
And <i>has...</i>

03:41.839 --> 03:43.472
she met you?
No, she <i>has...</i> not.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.724
Think of all the sex
you're gonna <i>ha..</i>

03:45.726 --> 03:47.092
Barney.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.627
I ha... I have to go.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.629
What, now?

03:53.799 --> 03:55.600
Yeah.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.405
Y...

04:00.407 --> 04:02.574
W-We have to do this outside.

04:09.866 --> 04:11.483
Robin.

04:12.368 --> 04:14.169
It's been a major pleasure.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.454
Major Pleasure.
Major Pleasure.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.656
Come here.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.045
Congratulations.

04:23.047 --> 04:24.763
Thank you.

04:30.669 --> 04:33.972
Oh, God, no, this is too real.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.075
I can't handle this,
Marshall's next.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.177
Marshall.

04:40.897 --> 04:43.732
Good luck out there
in Chicago.

04:43.734 --> 04:46.118
I'm gonna be kind of jealous
of you, getting to have

04:46.120 --> 04:48.620
Gazzola's pizza
whenever you want.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.821
You're gonna be in Rome.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.791
Yeah. I guess.

04:59.031 --> 05:00.298
I just...

05:00.300 --> 05:03.468
I feel like a hug isn't enough.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.387
E.T. good-bye?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.894
I'll be right...

05:12.896 --> 05:15.713
here.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.849
Okay, it helped,
but that was really creepy.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.068
I don't want to see you for awhile.

05:22.271 --> 05:24.439
Barney.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.725
Mm.

05:29.612 --> 05:31.129
We licked the Liberty Bell.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.497
We did?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.249
Yeah, you...

05:34.251 --> 05:35.617
You don't remember that?

05:35.619 --> 05:38.253
Uh, I've done
a lot of cool stuff, Ted.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.073
Oh, my God.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.925
I just... I just realized:

05:43.927 --> 05:45.510
Who am I gonna high five now?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.763
Come on, dude.
No, no,

05:47.765 --> 05:49.798
I'm being serious.
What if I see...

05:49.800 --> 05:52.517
a pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.052
Or, better yet,

05:54.054 --> 05:55.804
what if I see boobs?

05:55.806 --> 05:57.522
Who am I...
who am I gonna high five then?

05:57.524 --> 05:58.640
You can high
five Marshall.

05:58.642 --> 06:00.058
Yeah, yeah. But Marshall

06:00.060 --> 06:02.144
only likes to high five
about Lily boobs.

06:02.146 --> 06:04.062
Oh, always.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.281
Okay, Barney.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.200
I have an idea.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.152
One last high five.

06:10.154 --> 06:13.938
A high five to echo
throughout eternity.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.440
Yes.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.075
And within
that high five will be

06:17.077 --> 06:19.294
all the high fives
we've ever high fived.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.414
And all the high fives we
could ever possibly high five.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.382
A high infinity.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.917
A high infinity, exactly.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.951
Let's do this.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.453
All right,
everybody back up.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.639
Oh, boy.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.977
I'll see you
on the other side, Ray.

06:36.962 --> 06:39.147
Nice working with you,
Dr. Venkman.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.236
Aah!

06:44.970 --> 06:47.189
Ow!
Ow!

06:47.191 --> 06:49.641
Oh. Oh.
Oh!

06:49.643 --> 06:50.775
Worth it.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.977
So worth it.

06:53.979 --> 06:56.081
So I rushed out
to make the train,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.999
which is now 45 minutes late.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.485
This lady
with the bass guitar--

07:00.487 --> 07:02.087
was she pretty?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.342
Yeah.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.493
She was beautiful.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.961
Go back and meet her.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.463
No.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.431
But what if it was destiny?

07:15.852 --> 07:19.170
Lady, it's been
a really long weekend.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.973
I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.359
I can't really
talk destiny right now.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.528
Okay.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.820
Yes?

07:35.822 --> 07:40.408
What if the universe
sent you a gigantic sign

07:40.410 --> 07:43.578
that this woman
<i>was</i> your destiny?

07:43.580 --> 07:45.196
Then would you talk to her?

07:46.749 --> 07:49.501
Yeah, sure. I mean,
I-I guess I would have to.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.502
Okay.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.554
Okay.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.038
Where is that train?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.675
Can I ask one more question?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.042
What?

07:58.044 --> 08:00.679
This girl with the bass guitar--

08:00.681 --> 08:02.380
is that her?

08:08.002 --> 08:09.686
That <i>is</i> her, isn't it?

08:09.688 --> 08:12.139
This is so exciting.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.574
G-Go talk to her.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.059
All right. Just be cool,
lady. Damn.

08:16.061 --> 08:17.744
Why are you still
sitting here?

08:17.746 --> 08:21.265
Because I'm moving to
Chicago tomorrow, remember?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.000
And 24 hours
from now,

08:23.002 --> 08:26.503
my life is gonna be
completely different.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.423
<i>This is so strange,</i>
<i>you know, now that Ted's</i>

08:29.425 --> 08:33.477
gone, it's just a...
a different vibe.

08:33.479 --> 08:36.962
You can just f-feel
his absence.

08:36.965 --> 08:38.682
Are you kidding me?!

08:38.683 --> 08:39.732
Oh, hey.

08:39.735 --> 08:41.985
Ted, what are
you doing here?

08:41.986 --> 08:43.135
Just having a drink.

08:43.138 --> 08:44.571
What are you doing
in New York?

08:44.573 --> 08:46.106
Aren't you
supposed to be in Chicago?

08:46.108 --> 08:47.741
No... Oh.

08:47.743 --> 08:49.243
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

08:49.245 --> 08:50.644
What?
What?

08:50.646 --> 08:54.164
I'm not moving to Chicago.
Why?

08:54.166 --> 08:55.749
I met a girl.
You...

08:55.751 --> 08:57.201
son of a bitch!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.869
What is the matter with you?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.320
How could you put us
through that?

09:00.322 --> 09:03.290
That good-bye was
emotionally devastating.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.176
A certain delicate flower
cried all night in the shower.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.045
And I was pretty
bummed, too.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.046
And now you're

09:09.048 --> 09:10.547
staying because of some girl?

09:10.549 --> 09:12.716
I mean, who is
this person?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.518
The bass player
from the wedding band.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.969
Oh, yeah, she's great.

09:15.971 --> 09:17.104
Love her.
Right,

09:17.106 --> 09:18.672
right?

09:18.674 --> 09:21.108
What are you... What are you doing?
Calling her.

09:21.110 --> 09:23.594
Don't do this.
Don't call her the next day.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.761
You're blowing this.
Huh?

09:24.763 --> 09:26.680
Three days.
You wait three days,

09:26.682 --> 09:27.731
Ted.
Oh, the

09:27.733 --> 09:30.234
three day rule
is-is a childish,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.536
manipulative
mind game.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.738
But yeah, you
wait three days.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.158
H-Hey, it's Ted. Hi. Um,

09:38.160 --> 09:40.877
listen, do you ... do you want
to have dinner tomorrow night?

09:40.879 --> 09:42.362
Great.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.214
It was clear I meant
with me, right?

09:45.133 --> 09:47.668
Same answer. Solid.

09:48.803 --> 09:51.004
Why does he keep
doing this?

09:51.006 --> 09:53.807
He meets 'em,
he likes 'em way too much,

09:53.809 --> 09:56.977
he goes way too big, too soon,
and he ends up blowing it.

09:56.979 --> 09:58.845
I can't take this anymore.

09:58.847 --> 10:01.732
He's fallen in love
so many times now.

10:03.735 --> 10:06.052
Not like this.

10:06.054 --> 10:08.221
This is different.

10:08.223 --> 10:10.557
Come on, go talk to her.

10:10.559 --> 10:12.609
Oh, and it'll all be
because of me.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.412
And I'll sing
at your wedding.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.614
Y-You are gonna have
a big wedding, right?

10:17.616 --> 10:20.167
What? No.
Just be cool, lady. Damn.

10:22.086 --> 10:24.904
And aren't big weddings
kind of a young man's game?

10:24.906 --> 10:27.073
You don't have a big wedding
in your 30s.

10:27.075 --> 10:28.959
If I do ever get married,

10:28.961 --> 10:30.677
I'm keeping it simple.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.846
<i>A hot air balloon?</i>

10:32.848 --> 10:35.132
Well, yeah. I mean,
when you're getting married

10:35.134 --> 10:37.601
in a 17th-century castle in
France and making your entrance

10:37.603 --> 10:39.136
on a stagecoach
with six white horses,

10:39.138 --> 10:41.271
you kind of got to make
a big exit.

10:41.273 --> 10:44.391
How much are you
spending on this?

10:44.393 --> 10:46.893
Oh, like, a lot of money.

10:46.895 --> 10:48.278
Mm.
All of my money.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.814
Look, I know you guys
have been traveling a lot,

10:50.816 --> 10:52.232
but you're coming, right?

10:52.234 --> 10:54.100
Oh course. What...
Duh.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.103
I'll get the next round.

10:57.105 --> 10:58.155
Thanks.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.289
I'd offer, but...

10:59.291 --> 11:00.407
Castle.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.160
Yeah.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.778
So, how you guys doing?

11:04.780 --> 11:06.630
I mean, Robin's really
taking off at work, huh?

11:06.632 --> 11:10.250
It's like, "Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News, Caracas."

11:10.252 --> 11:13.086
"Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide
News, St. Petersburg."

11:13.088 --> 11:14.721
"Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News,

11:14.723 --> 11:17.174
anywhere but New York,
apparently."

11:17.176 --> 11:18.458
But it's great.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.727
Uh, it's makes things
super difficult for us,

11:20.729 --> 11:23.597
but it's great. It's great.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.066
It's great. It's great.

11:26.068 --> 11:27.150
One more and I'll believe you.

11:27.152 --> 11:29.319
It's great.
Sounds great.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.978
Hey.
Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

11:30.979 --> 11:32.258
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:32.283 --> 11:34.643
Yeah, sure. Did you wire the
down payment to the castle guy?

11:35.143 --> 11:36.660
I got a castle guy.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.079
I've got, like,
three castle guys.

11:39.081 --> 11:41.782
And a moat guy, so...

11:41.784 --> 11:44.785
I didn't wire the
payment because

11:44.787 --> 11:48.138
I don't think we can get
married in September.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.190
What-What, why?
Because,

11:50.192 --> 11:52.158
when I do get married,

11:52.160 --> 11:54.795
I kind of want to fit

11:54.797 --> 11:57.664
in... my dress.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.967
Why wouldn't you f...

12:01.669 --> 12:02.769
No.

12:02.771 --> 12:03.770
Yeah.

12:03.772 --> 12:04.838
No.
Yeah.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.839
Yeah, yeah.

12:05.841 --> 12:08.024
Yeah.
Whoa.

12:09.894 --> 12:11.395
What's going on?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.864
She's getting a boob job.

12:15.182 --> 12:17.534
<i>We just peeked in on Penny</i>

12:17.536 --> 12:18.952
asleep in the baby room.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.070
It's adorable.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.456
The whole place
looks great, guys.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.575
But I can't believe you let Ted
hang his jousting lance

12:25.577 --> 12:27.961
from the renaissance fair
on your bedroom wall.

12:27.963 --> 12:29.880
Yeah.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.364
That's Ted's.

12:32.383 --> 12:33.884
So, Marshall, how's your job going?
Mm.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.035
My chair...

12:36.037 --> 12:38.121
is reasonably comfortable.

12:38.123 --> 12:40.390
For short periods of time.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.876
Marshall has decided to say

12:42.878 --> 12:45.679
only positive things about
being back in corporate law.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.713
So you hate it?

12:46.715 --> 12:49.716
Much of what I do does not
make me cry.

12:49.718 --> 12:52.486
But the job's only temporary.

12:52.488 --> 12:55.405
Marshall was offered
the judgeship once,

12:55.407 --> 12:57.157
and he turned it down for me.

12:57.159 --> 12:59.776
So, karmically, that phone
has to ring again.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.695
And even if it doesn't,

13:01.697 --> 13:03.497
today, when my boss

13:03.499 --> 13:06.399
threw his egg salad sandwich
at my face,

13:06.401 --> 13:08.335
some of it got into my mouth.

13:08.337 --> 13:10.337
And it was tasty.

13:10.339 --> 13:12.539
Hey, what
about you guys?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.007
How was Argentina?

13:15.576 --> 13:17.744
Great. It was great.

13:17.746 --> 13:19.095
It was great.
It was great.

13:19.097 --> 13:20.881
It was great.
It <i>was</i> great.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.750
It was great.

13:23.752 --> 13:25.635
One more and I'll
believe you.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.855
This is so not great.

13:28.857 --> 13:31.608
I'm sorry that I have
to work while I'm here.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.977
It's called being on assignment.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.363
Well, what about me? There's
no Wi-Fi in this hotel.

13:35.364 --> 13:37.481
How am I supposed to
run a business, Robin,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.232
with no Wi-Fi?

13:39.234 --> 13:41.451
It's not a business,
Barney, it's a blog, okay?

13:41.453 --> 13:43.370
It is a lifestyle blog.

13:43.372 --> 13:46.490
For the upscale, sophisticated
urban gentleman, and it's

13:46.492 --> 13:50.293
never gonna take off if I can't
post today's boner joke.

13:53.831 --> 13:55.582
I know I'm always traveling.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.918
We both hate it when
I'm gone, we both hate it

13:57.920 --> 14:00.720
when I drag you with me.
Neither of us is happy.

14:02.423 --> 14:04.474
Is this just not
working anymore?

14:04.476 --> 14:07.344
Wait, w... What "this"?
This-this?

14:07.346 --> 14:11.681
If I gave you an out,
right now--

14:11.683 --> 14:13.900
if there was
an exit ramp right here

14:13.902 --> 14:17.404
at the three-year mark--

14:17.406 --> 14:19.406
would you take it?

14:20.975 --> 14:22.325
Before I answer that,
real quick:

14:22.327 --> 14:24.644
you want to get super drunk
and have sex right now?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.413
Of course.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.915
And then, one thing
led to another.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.483
And then another.

14:30.485 --> 14:31.701
And then another
after that.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.086
Oh.
Oh.

14:33.088 --> 14:35.505
And we kept drinking, and

14:35.507 --> 14:38.124
may have had
a little... too much.

14:42.797 --> 14:44.180
<i>Arigato.</i>

14:44.182 --> 14:45.715
Wow, these rooms
all look the same,

14:45.717 --> 14:47.000
even when you're sober.

14:47.002 --> 14:49.469
You're sober?

14:51.522 --> 14:53.840
So, um...

14:53.842 --> 14:57.444
about what we discussed
last night.

14:59.013 --> 15:01.364
How do you feel?

15:08.489 --> 15:10.624
I love you, Robin.

15:13.661 --> 15:16.246
And when we got married,

15:16.248 --> 15:22.168
I made a vow that I would always
tell you the truth.

15:23.704 --> 15:27.807
We got divorced.

15:33.498 --> 15:36.084
I can't believe you got
divorced without telling us.

15:36.085 --> 15:38.719
This is my mom and
dad all over again.

15:38.721 --> 15:40.938
Barney, if you start
brewing your own beer now

15:40.940 --> 15:42.707
and nail my prom
date, so help me...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.275
Years too late on
one of those, Teddy.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.544
Guys, it's okay.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.579
This isn't
a failed marriage.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.231
It's a very
successful marriage

15:50.233 --> 15:52.116
that happened to
only last three years.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.118
You both want this?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.953
For real?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.955
We do.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.773
For real.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.427
Lily, you okay?

16:03.429 --> 16:04.962
Of course
I'm not okay.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.415
This ruins
everything.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.749
Now we have to choose sides,

16:08.751 --> 16:10.885
and obviously
we're gonna choose Robin,

16:10.887 --> 16:12.720
but Barney has his moments.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.221
I really liked

16:14.223 --> 16:15.639
the boner joke of the day.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.975
Look, you guys do not need
to pick sides.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.185
Nothing has to change.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.645
No. We've already
broken up before

16:20.646 --> 16:22.680
and we've stayed friends,
remember?

16:22.682 --> 16:26.650
As long as you promise me this
won't mean we stop hanging out.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.853
Okay.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.654
I'm serious.
I know, but, I mean,

16:30.656 --> 16:32.606
we hardly hang out anymore
anyway.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.641
They live in the suburbs now,

16:34.643 --> 16:36.660
and you two are about
to have baby number three.

16:38.313 --> 16:40.448
Please. You're so obvious.

16:40.450 --> 16:42.983
Your gals are back up
to a full C-cup,

16:42.985 --> 16:45.152
and you've been sipping
her drink all night long.

16:46.038 --> 16:47.588
We didn't want
to announce anything

16:47.590 --> 16:48.956
till we knew for sure.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.341
Oh, my gosh, Lily!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.926
That's amazing!
Oh, congratulations!

16:51.928 --> 16:53.994
Oh, my God.
Wait, see?

16:53.996 --> 16:55.629
This, right here,

16:55.631 --> 16:58.832
this is why we can't fall
out of each other's lives.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.435
We have to be here
for the big moments.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.854
Just promise me,
no matter what,

17:03.856 --> 17:06.690
we will always be there
for the big moments.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.844
I-I promise. We'll-we'll always
be there for the big moments.

17:11.695 --> 17:13.696
Mm.
See?

17:13.699 --> 17:16.517
It's like this whole divorce
thing never happened.

17:17.787 --> 17:18.986
I...

17:21.656 --> 17:23.040
Hey.
Hi, sweetie.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.625
How was work?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.828
My-my boss only called me
three words

17:27.829 --> 17:30.498
that meant "vagina" today.

17:31.299 --> 17:33.033
How are the kids?
Asleep.

17:33.035 --> 17:35.169
Good. This is working, right?

17:35.171 --> 17:38.255
Marvin and Daisy sharing a room
together? It's not too cramped?

17:38.257 --> 17:40.257
And then when the
next one arrives,

17:40.259 --> 17:43.227
we'll just put her
crib... in the shower.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.930
It's the perfect size.
It'll save time on cleanups...

17:45.932 --> 17:46.880
Let's move
somewhere bigger.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.849
Yes. Oh, thank God.

17:48.851 --> 17:51.385
I mean... You know,

17:51.387 --> 17:53.887
don't get me wrong.
I love this apartment.

17:53.889 --> 17:56.157
How do you say good-bye
to so many special memories?

17:56.159 --> 17:59.076
Cock-a-mouse!
We have to move!

18:02.464 --> 18:06.000
Hey, Marshall.
Robin!

18:06.002 --> 18:08.335
Hey, I'm so glad you're here.
It's-it's been forever.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.004
Oh, hey.
Hey.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.705
Where's your...
where's your costume?

18:11.707 --> 18:14.291
Oh, uh, it's been
a crazy week at work

18:14.293 --> 18:16.043
so no time to go shopping.

18:16.045 --> 18:18.345
Uh, well, who are
you supposed to be?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.747
Okay, I want to make it clear
this is not my idea.

18:20.749 --> 18:22.550
I'm Captain Ahab.

18:22.552 --> 18:24.802
Why is it bad
if it was your idea?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.887
Robin, you made it!
A white whale. Got it.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.106
Aw. Hi.
Hi.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.608
Yeah, I figured,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.927
people are thinkin' it. Might as
well steer into the skid, right?

18:33.929 --> 18:35.613
Where's your costume?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.897
Oh, you know,
I've just been so...

18:36.899 --> 18:38.399
Oh, my God, Marshall!

18:38.401 --> 18:40.100
Guess whose digits
I just scored?

18:40.102 --> 18:42.403
The slutty
police officer's...

18:42.405 --> 18:44.738
tax attorney.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.273
Hey, Robin!

18:46.275 --> 18:48.075
Hey.
Didn't see you there.

18:48.077 --> 18:50.411
Saved it.

18:50.413 --> 18:51.912
Sorry, I got to pee.

18:51.914 --> 18:54.715
I-I'll be back
in... an hour.

18:57.969 --> 18:59.587
Oh, man.

18:59.589 --> 19:02.173
Is Ted still wearing
his hanging chad costume?

19:02.175 --> 19:04.225
How old is that thing?
It's gone

19:04.227 --> 19:06.960
from played out to
charmingly retro and back

19:06.962 --> 19:08.462
six or seven times now.

19:08.464 --> 19:09.930
Kind of
like Ted himself.

19:09.932 --> 19:12.099
Tonight it's working
for him though.

19:12.101 --> 19:15.769
<i>How do you do this, Ted?</i>
<i>How do you</i>

19:15.771 --> 19:18.155
sit out here all night
on the roof in the cold

19:18.157 --> 19:21.058
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

19:21.060 --> 19:23.777
Look, I know that odds are
the love of my life

19:23.779 --> 19:25.829
isn't gonna magically walk
through that door

19:25.831 --> 19:27.648
in a pumpkin costume at...

19:27.650 --> 19:30.150
2:43 in the morning, but...

19:30.152 --> 19:33.871
this seems as nice a spot
as any to just, you know...

19:33.873 --> 19:36.473
sit and wait.

19:43.632 --> 19:45.849
Um...

19:45.851 --> 19:48.835
uh, c-can you tell Lily
I-I had to go?

19:48.837 --> 19:50.471
I got to split.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.842
Speaking of splits, do you think
I can do a split in midair

19:55.844 --> 19:57.811
like my boy
David Lee Roth?

19:57.813 --> 19:58.679
I know you can't.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.347
Challenge accepted.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.122
Oh, my scrotum!

20:15.797 --> 20:17.381
I can't get out
of this thing.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.799
I'm holding it.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.001
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah,

20:21.003 --> 20:23.036
I got a big day tomorrow.
I got to get some sleep.

20:23.038 --> 20:26.056
No, you can't leave.
This is a big moment.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.475
We're saying good-bye
to the apartment.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.844
The whole gang has to be here.

20:30.846 --> 20:32.463
The gang?

20:32.465 --> 20:35.232
Do you know who the gang is
to me, Lily?

20:35.984 --> 20:36.900
Here's what the gang is:

20:36.902 --> 20:39.103
the gang is a married couple

20:39.105 --> 20:42.656
who I never see anymore,
about to have their third kid;

20:42.658 --> 20:44.692
it's my ex-husband,

20:44.694 --> 20:47.745
hitting on slutty cops
right in front of me;

20:47.747 --> 20:51.732
and it's the guy I probably
should have ended up with

20:51.734 --> 20:54.034
with the beautiful mother
of his child.

20:54.036 --> 20:56.287
I mean, who in their right mind
would call

20:56.289 --> 20:58.405
that group of people "the gang"?

20:58.407 --> 21:00.591
Oh...

21:02.410 --> 21:04.928
Oh, oh, so... so what?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.597
This is all

21:06.599 --> 21:08.349
just over then?

21:08.351 --> 21:11.802
Our whole friendship
is just over?

21:11.804 --> 21:14.855
No. No, of course not.
Look, we'll...

21:14.857 --> 21:17.608
we'll always be friends.
It's just...

21:17.610 --> 21:20.277
never gonna be how it was.

21:21.313 --> 21:22.596
It can't be.

21:22.598 --> 21:23.814
And that doesn't

21:23.816 --> 21:26.099
have to be a sad thing.

21:26.101 --> 21:28.569
There-There's so much
wonderful stuff happening

21:28.571 --> 21:31.104
in all of our
lives right now.

21:31.106 --> 21:33.407
Look, more than enough
to be grateful for.

21:34.442 --> 21:37.277
But the five of us
hanging out at MacLaren's,

21:37.279 --> 21:39.129
being young and stupid...

21:39.131 --> 21:42.716
that's just not one
of those things.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.053
That part's over.

21:47.722 --> 21:50.391
I got to go.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.560
Good night, Lily.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.897
Good night.

22:16.118 --> 22:17.300
<i>Marshall's almost here.</i>

22:17.302 --> 22:19.219
Yes! Look at us,

22:19.221 --> 22:22.155
hanging out again.
This is amazing.

22:22.157 --> 22:23.623
This is awesome!

22:23.625 --> 22:27.627
This is...
Okay.

22:27.629 --> 22:29.813
Just settle down, buddy.
No!

22:29.815 --> 22:33.433
Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.568
I am in
charge tonight,

22:34.570 --> 22:37.137
and the earliest
I am allowing anyone

22:37.139 --> 22:39.806
to go home is...
2:00 a.m.

22:39.808 --> 22:41.491
10:00 p.m.
9:45.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.692
3:00 a.m.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.695
Guys, tonight
is gonna be legen--

22:45.697 --> 22:48.448
wait for it...

22:48.450 --> 22:49.783
If I leave now,

22:49.785 --> 22:50.867
I could put
the kids to bed.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.868
I'll get the check.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.170
..dary!

22:53.172 --> 22:54.754
Legendary!

22:54.756 --> 22:56.873
Guys, the gang is back!

22:56.875 --> 23:00.326
We're back!

23:00.328 --> 23:03.180
All of us except for Robin.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.498
We never see her anymore.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.184
Okay, in addition
to you guys not going home

23:07.186 --> 23:09.836
before 4:00 a.m.--
yes, it's up to 4:00 now--

23:09.838 --> 23:13.006
new rule: anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

23:13.008 --> 23:15.275
we stay out an extra hour.

23:15.277 --> 23:17.644
We said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.396
5:00 a.m.
To be fair,

23:19.398 --> 23:20.847
tonight's just
us hanging out

23:20.849 --> 23:22.315
until 10:00 p.m., tops.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.316
It's not a big moment.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.317
Um,

23:24.319 --> 23:25.869
yes, it is.
Um, no, it's not.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.122
Um, yes, it is.
Um... no, it's not.

23:29.124 --> 23:31.541
Um, yes, it is.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.910
I got a phone call today.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.647
A judge in Queens is retiring,
so...

23:37.649 --> 23:39.483
I'm gonna be a judge.

23:40.302 --> 23:42.469
Yes! Yes!

23:42.471 --> 23:44.971
Judge Eriksen!

23:44.973 --> 23:47.557
Yeah!
 One more.

23:47.559 --> 23:50.877
I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

23:50.879 --> 23:52.395
Thanks, Lily.

23:52.397 --> 23:55.265
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- Oh.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.850
1:45 a.m.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.352
Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

23:59.354 --> 24:01.399
legendary, but...

24:01.424 --> 24:02.690
I know what you're gonna say
and I agree.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.107
We're going to Vegas!

24:04.109 --> 24:05.525
I will be awakened

24:05.527 --> 24:09.696
by screaming children
in less than...

24:09.698 --> 24:12.282
four-and-a-half hours.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.416
You're staying.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.400
I'm going.

24:14.402 --> 24:15.752
Judge Fudge,
your very first ruling?

24:15.754 --> 24:17.170
He stays.

24:17.172 --> 24:18.538
Hey! See?

24:18.540 --> 24:20.090
Tonight is about

24:20.092 --> 24:23.376
celebrating our enduring bond
as friends.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.412
Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

24:26.414 --> 24:27.631
We are fa...

24:27.633 --> 24:29.015
Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

24:29.017 --> 24:30.583
Damn it, Barney.

24:30.585 --> 24:33.436
Crushing... windpipe.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.689
You're lucky that's
the only pipe I'm crushing.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.091
Aah!
That woman is half your age.

24:38.093 --> 24:40.260
Haven't you changed,
even a little?

24:40.262 --> 24:42.362
No. I haven't.

24:43.147 --> 24:45.065
Look, I know
there was a time

24:45.067 --> 24:47.200
when it seemed like I was
capable of going the distance,

24:47.202 --> 24:51.204
but... if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

24:51.206 --> 24:53.707
then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

24:53.709 --> 24:54.941
I am never

24:54.943 --> 24:56.826
gonna be a guy
who meets a girl

24:56.828 --> 24:59.129
and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

24:59.131 --> 25:01.831
"You are the
love of my life.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.283
"Everything
I have

25:03.285 --> 25:07.087
and everything I am
is yours forever."

25:07.089 --> 25:08.310
Really?

25:08.335 --> 25:10.414
No, I'm just making a point.
Move it along.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.560
That's not me.

25:13.562 --> 25:15.628
I'm the guy
who straightens his tie,

25:15.630 --> 25:17.347
says something dirty,
high-fives himself

25:17.349 --> 25:19.649
and then goes and talks
to that girl over there.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.335
That's me.

25:22.337 --> 25:26.239
Can I please... just be me?

25:27.975 --> 25:30.110
Judge Fudge?

25:31.979 --> 25:34.331
I'll allow it.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.951
Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.704
Stinson out.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.042
Oh!

25:46.044 --> 25:47.844
Hey, so are you guys

25:47.846 --> 25:49.512
ever gonna tie the knot
or are you...

25:49.514 --> 25:51.681
are you just comfortable
living in sin?

25:51.683 --> 25:52.882
Someone's gotten a bit...

25:52.884 --> 25:54.500
judge-y.
Oh!

25:54.502 --> 25:56.686
- Sustained.
- Yeah.

25:56.688 --> 25:58.521
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,

25:58.523 --> 26:00.857
with life and
jobs and kids.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.675
Plus, this one's still
insisting on getting married

26:02.677 --> 26:03.860
in a French castle.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.980
I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

26:06.982 --> 26:09.849
but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

26:09.851 --> 26:12.152
You're all the wow factor
I need.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.536
Aw!

26:15.991 --> 26:18.484
Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.

26:18.485 --> 26:18.955
Aw, Barney,

26:18.960 --> 26:20.994
you know this is
all fake, right?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.746
That robot's
not really dead.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.080
I'm not

26:24.082 --> 26:27.133
talking about the robot, Lily.
Everyone,

26:27.135 --> 26:30.870
stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

26:30.872 --> 26:35.041
Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

26:35.043 --> 26:37.043
Seven girls in
seven nights, sure.

26:37.045 --> 26:38.478
Well, recently,

26:38.480 --> 26:40.263
I decided to attempt...

26:40.265 --> 26:42.332
a perfect month.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.268
<i>I put together</i>
<i>a brand-new playbook.</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:48.104
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.190
But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.558
You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.559
That's

26:53.561 --> 26:54.611
the sad part.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.780
Lily... just...

26:56.782 --> 26:58.498
Okay?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.284
So I put together
a brand-new playbook,

27:01.286 --> 27:04.371
filled with plays
I'd never tried before, like...

27:05.823 --> 27:07.707
<i>...where,</i>
<i>as in the '80s classic,</i>

27:07.709 --> 27:12.095
<i>I magically</i> come <i>to life,</i>
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

27:13.531 --> 27:16.182
<i>...where I wait till a girl</i>
<i>mentions something she likes.</i>

27:16.184 --> 27:17.917
God, I love nachos.

27:17.919 --> 27:19.969
Thank you.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.554
Allow me to introduce myself.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.772
My name is Jim,

27:22.774 --> 27:24.590
Jim Nacho.

27:24.592 --> 27:28.611
Inventor of the nacho.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.397
So... did you get
a perfect month?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.782
Yes.

27:32.784 --> 27:34.600
Then why are
you so upset?

27:34.602 --> 27:37.070
That last girl, number 31...

27:37.072 --> 27:40.073
Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

27:40.075 --> 27:42.492
...she's pregnant.

27:46.739 --> 27:48.255
Wait, you're messing
with us, right?

27:48.280 --> 27:50.254
You didn't really
get a girl pregnant?

27:50.567 --> 27:52.174
It's real.

27:52.199 --> 27:53.590
She's pregnant.

27:55.017 --> 27:56.229
Kinda puts an asterisk,

27:56.254 --> 27:58.269
on the whole perfect
month thing, huh?

27:59.873 --> 28:01.824
Barney,
are you okay?

28:02.709 --> 28:05.044
Ah, Jim Nantz.

28:05.046 --> 28:07.914
Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

28:07.916 --> 28:09.415
What should I do?

28:09.417 --> 28:11.283
You're on your own
this time, bro.

28:12.586 --> 28:14.787
Congratulations, Papa.

28:14.789 --> 28:17.556
Stop it. This is a disaster.

28:17.558 --> 28:18.507
Why?

28:18.509 --> 28:20.793
Why? Because I'm too old.

28:20.795 --> 28:22.061
I was about

28:22.063 --> 28:26.098
to enter my golden years,
my Clooney years,

28:26.100 --> 28:28.651
my daddy issues years,

28:28.653 --> 28:31.354
where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

28:31.356 --> 28:32.822
because I'm emotionally distant.

28:32.824 --> 28:36.259
I freaking look like
their dads. That's the dream.

28:36.261 --> 28:37.293
My life

28:37.295 --> 28:39.612
is over.

28:39.614 --> 28:42.748
So where are you guys
registered?

28:44.251 --> 28:47.586
<i>Another fun fact about the</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank building,</i>

28:47.588 --> 28:50.039
the sleek but historical facade
has been described

28:50.041 --> 28:53.793
by <i>Architecture Vision Monthly</i>
as "modern classicism."

28:53.795 --> 28:55.461
I can see that.

28:55.463 --> 28:57.630
Mm-hmm. Any questions
from the group?

28:57.632 --> 28:58.998
I have a
question.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.933
What happened to the building
that used to be here?

29:00.935 --> 29:02.218
It was way nicer.

29:02.220 --> 29:03.469
Robin!

29:03.471 --> 29:05.271
Oh, my God!

29:05.273 --> 29:07.006
What are you doing here?

29:07.008 --> 29:08.007
I thought you were in...

29:08.009 --> 29:10.559
Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow.

29:10.561 --> 29:12.728
Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

29:12.730 --> 29:14.013
And pretty famous.

29:14.015 --> 29:15.314
I mean, you're everywhere.

29:15.316 --> 29:18.017
I am not everywhere. The...

29:18.902 --> 29:20.619
Okay, I'm some places.

29:20.621 --> 29:22.905
Hi, Penny.

29:22.907 --> 29:26.125
Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

29:26.127 --> 29:28.694
I like you, bus lady.
Oh,

29:28.696 --> 29:29.712
I like you, too.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.196
Never call me that again.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.499
And that was it.

29:33.501 --> 29:35.217
Wow.
Hm.

29:35.219 --> 29:38.754
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting
out in nature.

29:38.756 --> 29:42.174
At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

29:42.176 --> 29:44.810
No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

29:44.812 --> 29:46.979
At this point, Robin's
more like the yeti--

29:46.981 --> 29:48.514
cold and aloof.

29:49.215 --> 29:50.850
Hey, Ted.

29:50.852 --> 29:53.152
Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

29:53.154 --> 29:54.987
Has the Abominable Snowman
called?

29:54.989 --> 29:56.388
Not yeti.

29:57.057 --> 29:58.557
Here we are again.

29:58.559 --> 30:02.227
Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

30:02.229 --> 30:03.696
I know, baby.

30:03.698 --> 30:06.415
I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

30:06.417 --> 30:09.502
is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

30:11.923 --> 30:13.672
Well?

30:13.674 --> 30:15.424
It was... crazy in there,

30:15.426 --> 30:16.876
but...

30:16.878 --> 30:19.411
I threw up,
and now I feel better.

30:19.413 --> 30:20.546
Where were you?

30:20.548 --> 30:22.715
In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,

30:22.717 --> 30:24.717
so I put this on over my suit.

30:24.719 --> 30:26.769
Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

30:26.771 --> 30:28.587
We're gonna need a name
eventually.

30:28.589 --> 30:30.255
Mr. Stinson?

30:30.257 --> 30:32.191
Yes?
Congratulations.

30:32.193 --> 30:33.809
Congratulations because

30:33.811 --> 30:36.445
the blood test came back
and I'm not the father?!

30:36.447 --> 30:38.597
Happy Not a Father's Day!

30:38.599 --> 30:41.700
No. Congratulations.

30:41.702 --> 30:42.818
It's a girl.

30:42.820 --> 30:44.070
Would you like to meet her?

30:44.072 --> 30:45.571
Nah, I'm good.

30:45.573 --> 30:48.240
I don't...
Oh, just go meet your daughter!

30:49.109 --> 30:51.327
This is Ellie.

31:01.922 --> 31:04.423
I'll give you guys
a minute.

31:17.303 --> 31:21.157
You are the love
of my life.

31:25.746 --> 31:29.782
Everything I have...

31:29.784 --> 31:32.785
and everything I am...

31:34.154 --> 31:37.322
...is yours.

31:39.877 --> 31:42.044
Forever.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.809
What?

31:56.811 --> 31:59.145
Do I have stuff in my teeth?

31:59.147 --> 32:00.446
Give me your
engagement ring back.

32:00.448 --> 32:02.681
Just because I have
stuff in my teeth?

32:02.683 --> 32:04.349
We-we can work through this.

32:04.351 --> 32:05.701
Just give it back.

32:14.527 --> 32:18.530
If you don't get married in that
time, you have to re-propose.

32:18.532 --> 32:19.999
Will you...

32:20.001 --> 32:21.550
Yes. Yes, you silly man.

32:21.552 --> 32:22.751
Let me finish.

32:22.753 --> 32:23.819
Will you...

32:23.821 --> 32:25.037
Yes! Sorry.

32:25.555 --> 32:26.338
Yes.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.340
Will y...

32:28.342 --> 32:30.059
Will you marry me...

32:30.061 --> 32:31.727
on Thursday?

32:31.729 --> 32:34.880
I called your office--
you got nothing on Thursday.

32:34.882 --> 32:36.565
Will you marry me on Thursday?

32:36.567 --> 32:37.566
Yes.

32:45.993 --> 32:47.392
Same ring.

32:49.447 --> 32:51.580
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

32:51.582 --> 32:53.899
It's Ted Mosby's wedding day!

32:53.901 --> 32:56.735
Yes! After only seven
years and two kids.

32:56.737 --> 32:58.370
Guys, am I rushing
into this?

32:58.372 --> 32:59.588
Whoa.

32:59.590 --> 33:01.373
Oh, buddy, are you okay?

33:01.375 --> 33:03.759
So tired.

33:03.761 --> 33:05.911
Baby no sleepy.

33:05.913 --> 33:07.846
Barney dying.

33:07.848 --> 33:10.549
Well, we're staying out till
3:00 a.m. tonight.

33:10.551 --> 33:13.068
9:45!

33:13.070 --> 33:16.021
Seriously, though,
I am so proud of you.

33:16.023 --> 33:17.056
Not that
you're a dad.

33:17.058 --> 33:18.557
It's like
you're a totally

33:18.559 --> 33:19.975
different pers...
Whoa!

33:19.977 --> 33:22.228
And... we're back.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.698
Hey.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.067
Hi.
What to join us for shots?

33:28.069 --> 33:29.485
Shots?

33:29.487 --> 33:31.820
Before lunch on a Thursday?

33:31.822 --> 33:34.790
It's like you're <i>trying</i>
to make bad decisions.

33:34.792 --> 33:36.959
You young ladies
need to go home,

33:36.961 --> 33:38.610
put on some
decent clothes

33:38.612 --> 33:41.797
and take a good hard look
at your lives. Get!

33:42.632 --> 33:44.216
Call your parents--

33:44.218 --> 33:45.884
they're probably worried sick.

33:46.469 --> 33:48.921
I have officially

33:48.923 --> 33:51.257
seen everything.

33:53.343 --> 33:55.728
Not everything.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.285
Hi.
Hi.

34:08.989 --> 34:12.476
I-I know I've...
missed a couple lately, but...

34:12.478 --> 34:16.463
we said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

34:18.349 --> 34:20.150
Aw, crap.

34:20.152 --> 34:21.268
Mascara running.

34:21.270 --> 34:23.937
Nobody let her
out of your sight.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.859
Hi, Daddy.
Whoa.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.510
Look, Robin,
I'm really happy to see you,

34:30.512 --> 34:32.362
but I don't think of you
that way anymore.

34:32.364 --> 34:34.181
, dummy,
you had a kid.

34:34.183 --> 34:35.849
Congrats.
Right, yeah.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.618
Thanks. A kid.

34:37.620 --> 34:39.119
I'm tired.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.788
Oh.
But, uh,

34:40.790 --> 34:42.489
she's awesome.
Yeah?

34:42.491 --> 34:43.791
Yeah.

34:43.793 --> 34:45.859
Daddy's home.

34:48.362 --> 34:49.713
Mm.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.532
Judge Fudge? Hey?
 Hey...

34:52.534 --> 34:54.201
Actually, um, little
announcement for everybody.

34:54.203 --> 34:56.369
I'm gonna be running
for State Supreme Court.

34:56.371 --> 34:58.255
Yeah. So if
everything goes well,

34:58.257 --> 35:00.174
in a couple of months,
you won't be calling me

35:00.176 --> 35:01.892
Judge Fudge anymore.

35:01.894 --> 35:04.094
You'll be calling me
Fudge Supreme.

35:08.516 --> 35:10.284
The man of the hour.

35:10.286 --> 35:11.551
Yeah.

35:11.553 --> 35:13.070
You RSVP'd no.

35:13.072 --> 35:14.655
I did.

35:14.657 --> 35:19.392
But someone pretty persuasive
talked me into it.

35:24.565 --> 35:26.450
Sorry. I know
it's bad luck

35:26.452 --> 35:28.669
to see the bride
in her dress.

35:29.587 --> 35:31.371
Worth it.

35:33.625 --> 35:36.210
But I couldn't miss this.

35:36.212 --> 35:37.544
I want to get
a picture.

35:37.546 --> 35:39.930
Get in! I want to take
a picture of you guys.

35:39.932 --> 35:41.765
Come on, get together.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.083
Are you ready?

35:43.085 --> 35:45.269
All right, get in.
All right. All right.

35:45.271 --> 35:47.020
One, two,

35:47.022 --> 35:48.572
three.

35:56.281 --> 35:57.865
Hey. Hey, you kids.

35:57.867 --> 36:00.701
Yeah, you didn't sound
a <i>thousand</i> there.

36:02.737 --> 36:05.122
Do you have any idea
what happened right here

36:05.124 --> 36:06.623
in this very bar?

36:06.625 --> 36:08.408
No. What happened?

36:09.919 --> 36:11.835
Just...

36:13.922 --> 36:17.007
...just all kinds of stuff.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.461
A toast.

36:20.463 --> 36:21.962
Mm-hmm.

36:21.964 --> 36:23.330
Okay, first off...

36:23.332 --> 36:25.432
to everyone at
this table...

36:26.184 --> 36:28.269

guys so much,

36:28.271 --> 36:29.470

36:29.472 --> 36:31.355
Just move to the second part.
Okay, okay.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.340
Secondly, to Ted...

36:33.342 --> 36:34.141
Don't say it.

36:34.143 --> 36:36.226
...Evelyn Mosby.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.945
Thank you for that.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.813
A man with...

36:39.815 --> 36:42.283
more emotional endurance

36:42.285 --> 36:44.702
than anyone I know.

36:44.704 --> 36:45.852
It was a long,

36:45.854 --> 36:48.122
difficult road.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.824
Thank God we
finally got here.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.819
you're totally in love
with Aunt Robin.

40:38.821 --> 40:40.387
And you're thinking
about asking her out,

40:40.389 --> 40:42.589
and you want to know
if we're okay with it.

40:42.591 --> 40:43.924
I can't believe this.

40:43.926 --> 40:47.694
I kept this story short
and to the point,

40:47.696 --> 40:49.596
and you guys still missed it.

40:49.598 --> 40:51.932
The point of the story
is that...

40:51.934 --> 40:54.935
Is that you totally, totally, totally
have the hots for Aunt Robin.

40:54.937 --> 40:55.619
No, I don't.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.154
Yes, you do.

40:57.156 --> 40:58.572
You're grounded.

40:58.574 --> 40:59.990
Wow, you are really
into Aunt Robin.

40:59.992 --> 41:01.074
You're grounded, too.

41:02.493 --> 41:06.463
Okay, suppose I <i>were</i> interested
in Aunt Robin in that way--

41:06.465 --> 41:08.549
it's not like
I'd do anything about it.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.784
I got you guys to think about.
My gosh,

41:10.786 --> 41:12.085
we <i>love</i> Aunt Robin.

41:12.087 --> 41:14.054
Whenever she comes over
for dinner, you guys

41:14.056 --> 41:15.973
are so obvious.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.074
Come on, Dad.

41:17.076 --> 41:19.860
Mom's been gone
for six years now.

41:19.862 --> 41:21.678
It's time.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.816
What, I just...
just call her up on the phone

41:25.818 --> 41:28.101
and ask her out on a date?

41:28.103 --> 41:29.403
Yes.
Yes.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.154
And that... that's something

41:31.156 --> 41:32.356
you guys would want?

41:32.358 --> 41:33.824
Yes!
Yes!

41:39.180 --> 41:41.481
All right, I'll give her a call.

41:41.483 --> 41:43.066
Do it.
I am.

41:43.068 --> 41:44.985
Call her.
I'm <i>calling</i> her.

41:44.987 --> 41:46.003
Great.

41:46.005 --> 41:48.321
Here I go.

41:51.125 --> 41:52.943
Or...

41:56.347 --> 41:58.632
All right, home sweet home.

41:58.634 --> 42:01.385
Oh. Wait one second.

42:01.387 --> 42:02.853
Okay.

42:02.855 --> 42:05.689
Stay.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.007
We'll work on that.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.695
Television, display
front door security.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.730
