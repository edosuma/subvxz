15:45.821 --> 15:47.906
welcome to the galaxy.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.119
(GROANS) No!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.668
Finally!

15:59.751 --> 16:04.298
My brilliant getting-captured plan has led
us right to this two-bit terror.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.258
Time to take this sucker down.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.305
BOT: Invaders apprehended, Lord Dominator.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.475
Lord Dominator? Ah! That totally
rhymes with Hater!

16:19.897 --> 16:22.774
What? He totally looks like...

16:24.109 --> 16:25.569
(HIGH-PITCHED) Hey, friend.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.864
(SCREAMS)

16:29.198 --> 16:36.205
He's... destroy my enemy... hate... jerk!

16:36.955 --> 16:41.251
What I wanted to do! Gagh!
So cool.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.295
I must destroy!

Wander's my enemy.

16:58.519 --> 17:00.312
Enemy? Come on, Hater.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.232
You know, an enemy is just
a friend you haven't made yet.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.026
What? Ew! Shut up!

17:07.611 --> 17:09.238
Wander! you okay buddy?

17:09.321 --> 17:10.989
Impressive, sir.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.324
Sorry for doubting you.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.700
After defeating this guy,

17:13.784 --> 17:16.745
you most certainly are the greatest
in the galaxy.

17:44.106 --> 17:48.068
Okay, time out, fine. You could
be the greatest in the galaxy.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.112
Okay! Mercy, please!

17:50.195 --> 17:52.531

the guava!

18:02.416 --> 18:06.211
Oh, yes, you must definitely
conquer the entire galaxy with those.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.715

into my galaxy,

you're gonna have to deal with me!

18:43.582 --> 18:47.127
-Wander!
-I have had enough.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.047
I will have you know I gave you a gift.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.965
I complimented your ship.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.176
I've even played you a song.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.139
All in the name of friendship.

18:59.223 --> 19:02.351
And you can't even be neighborly and make
some small talk like,

19:02.434 --> 19:06.480
"Wow thanks for the fruit basket, Wander
Wander. Isn't that an interesting name?"

19:06.563 --> 19:10.317
And I'd be like "Well yeah, I guess. Funny
story, that's not really my..."

19:10.442 --> 19:14.613
But, but that's not important! What is
important is I told you that an enemy

19:14.696 --> 19:17.074
is just a friend you haven't made yet.

19:17.533 --> 19:21.245
But after your mood
and inconsiderate behavior today,

19:21.828 --> 19:25.874
I'm not sure I want to be your friend.

I'm! Co! Ming! Buh! Dee!

19:34.758 --> 19:39.263
...though it hurts to say it. I have to
tell you...

19:40.722 --> 19:44.643
...that I don't think that you deserve...

"What? Who is this guy?" Ha! Then I was
like, serious, then I was all, rah!

all, "ah! no! why?"

is what

21:40.801 --> 21:42.010
Hater's brother?

21:42.094 --> 21:45.305
Oh, maybe he's Lord Hater's dad come to
show him who's boss.

-Wait, Lord who?
-Uh, Lord Hater,

21:48.225 --> 21:50.477
that skeleton guy we work for?

21:50.561 --> 21:53.814
Oh my grop! I've been calling him the
wrong name for six months!

21:53.939 --> 21:55.315
Why didn't anyone tell me?!

21:55.482 --> 21:57.442
