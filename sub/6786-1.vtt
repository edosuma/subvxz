00:35.619 --> 00:36.911
Mars,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.790
so you name it,
and think that you know it.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.042
The Red Planet.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.169
No air, no life.

00:45.337 --> 00:50.842
But you do not know Mars,
for its true name is Barsoom.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.595
And it is not airless, nor is it dead,

00:56.932 --> 00:58.975
but it is dying.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.437
The city of Zodanga saw to that.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.317
Zodanga, the predator city,

01:08.944 --> 01:10.987
moving, devouring,

01:11.822 --> 01:14.323
draining Barsoom of energy and life.

01:17.286 --> 01:21.414
Only the great city of Helium
dared resist, stood strong,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.875
matched Zodanga airship for airship,

01:24.001 --> 01:26.335
holding fast for a thousand years.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.257
Until one day the ruler of Zodanga

01:31.341 --> 01:33.843
became cornered in a sandstorm.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.346
And everything changed.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.434
I need clean lights!

01:41.518 --> 01:42.518
Full loft, aye!

01:44.772 --> 01:45.772
Full loft!

01:59.536 --> 02:00.703
Intensity full!

02:00.913 --> 02:03.331
- Hard turn! Come about!
- Facing new plot!

02:03.415 --> 02:05.833
No time! Hard turn now!

02:15.219 --> 02:16.719
There!

02:20.224 --> 02:22.683
- Shadow!
- Shadow!

02:33.779 --> 02:35.279
Death to Helium!

03:28.292 --> 03:30.877
Being a fool is a great luxury, Sab Than.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.255
Get up.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.218
Who... What are you?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.637
We serve the Goddess.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.309
And she has chosen you
to receive this weapon.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.230
Do as we command
and you will rule all of Barsoom.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.901
With none to defy you.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.695
And nothing to stand in your way.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.259
New York City, 1881.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.496
Ma'am.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.676
Ten words a minimum.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.720
That's 50 cents,
unless you want special delivery.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.517
Special delivery it is.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.352
Name of sender?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.229
Carter.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.189
John Carter.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.865
Croton-on-Hudson!

05:50.142 --> 05:53.602
Mr. Burroughs? I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.

05:54.396 --> 05:58.107
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.460
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton,
your uncle's attorney.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.837
My deepest sympathies.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.465
His death came as a shock to all of us.

06:22.591 --> 06:26.135
He was a model of health and vigor.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.887
He just dropped dead in his study

06:27.971 --> 06:31.682
not five minutes after sending
word for me and the doctor.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.061
When I arrived he was already gone.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.571
The man never stopped digging.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.490
All over the world.

06:47.949 --> 06:52.411
No soon he started digging one hole
than he was off to Java

06:52.496 --> 06:54.955
or the Orkney Islands to dig another.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.416
He said it was pure research,

06:57.501 --> 07:01.962
but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.134
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.359
Every inch a cavalry man,
to the very end.

07:23.485 --> 07:27.029
Mother always said that Jack
never really came back from the war.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.199
That it was only his body
that went west.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.123
He used to tell me
the most wondrous stories.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.463
I'd like to pay my respects.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.468
You won't find a keyhole.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.138
Thing only opens from the inside.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.889
He insisted.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.851
No embalming,
an open coffin, no funeral.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.146
You don't acquire the kind of
wealth your uncle commanded

08:00.230 --> 08:02.398
by being like the rest of us.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.900
Come. Let's go inside.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.546
"And lastly, I hereby direct"

08:25.922 --> 08:29.341
"that my estate
shall be held in trust for 25 years,"

08:29.426 --> 08:32.094
"the income to benefit
my beloved nephew,."

08:32.220 --> 08:34.096
"Edgar Rice Burroughs,"

08:34.222 --> 08:37.600
"at the end of which term
the principal will revert to him."

08:40.020 --> 08:41.061
"In full."

08:45.942 --> 08:51.447
Of course I always adored
him, but it's been so long.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.949
Why me?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.578
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.709
It was his private journal.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.712
He was most explicit that you,

09:06.796 --> 09:09.715
and only you, would read its contents.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.636
Now, you might possibly find
some kind of explanation in here.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.307
I'll leave you now.

09:18.391 --> 09:23.646
Again, my condolences.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.928
My dear Edgar,

09:56.012 --> 09:57.930
I remember how
I used to take you on my knee

09:58.014 --> 09:59.765
and tell you wild tales,

09:59.849 --> 10:02.685
which you always
did me the great courtesy of believing.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.853
Now you are grown.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.605
Time and space have parted us,

10:06.690 --> 10:08.774
but I reach out across that distance

10:08.858 --> 10:10.401
to that same wide-eyed boy

10:10.485 --> 10:12.569
and ask him to believe me once more.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.490
This wild tale begins 13 years ago

10:16.574 --> 10:18.284
in the Arizona Territory

10:18.368 --> 10:21.036
between the PinaleÃ±o Mountains

10:21.162 --> 10:22.705
and the backside of hell.

10:23.123 --> 10:27.751
Fort Grant Outpost, 1868.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.855
Coming to load up on spider bait.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.235
No more, Carter.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.739
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.366
Yes, you're a goddamn loon!

10:59.909 --> 11:01.410
I done took all your money, Carter.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.370
Your tab's $100 in arrears.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.747
I'll pay.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.500
This old Yavapai I met
said he'd seen a cave...

11:08.585 --> 11:12.671
No. Stop! Not one more word
about your cave of gold.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.089
Oh, now, now.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.216
Show some respect!

11:17.260 --> 11:20.971
It's the evil spider cave of gold.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.767
You're cut off, Carter.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.977
Now get on home.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.191
Now, I do believe

11:32.275 --> 11:34.443
he done told you to get on out of here.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.946
I'll leave when these bags are full.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.792
I found that two days ago up by Bonita.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.421
That ought to cover my tab
and then some.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.636
Beans.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.098
The first item is beans.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.850
John Carter?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.478
Your presence
is requested up at the fort.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.022
I suggest you come peaceably.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.613
Do you, now?

12:26.496 --> 12:31.500
You are a difficult man to find,
Captain John Carter.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.670
First Virginia Cavalry,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.089
Army of Northern Virginia,

12:37.215 --> 12:39.049
Confederate States of America.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.136
I'm Colonel Powell.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.848
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry
of the United States...

12:50.520 --> 12:52.396
Excellent horseman.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.899
Fine swordsman.

12:56.109 --> 13:00.195
Decorated six times,
including the Southern Cross of Honor.

13:01.823 --> 13:06.368
At Five Forks, the company under
your command nearly turned the tide.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.208
In short, a born fighter.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.045
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam,

13:17.714 --> 13:20.507
a necessary man for the defense
of the Arizona Territory.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.967
No.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.720
Son, we are up to
our chinstraps in Apaches.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.013
Ain't my concern.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.640
I believe it is your concern, Captain.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.477
Folks are being attacked
in their own homes. Slain.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.188
You started it. You finish it.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.150
You've gone native, have you?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.360
Apaches can go to hell, too.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.114
We're nothing but a warring species,
and I want no part of it.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.199
You're a cavalry man.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.368
That makes you valuable
to our country and our cause.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.872
Colonel Powell, sir,

13:52.081 --> 13:54.958
whatever it is you suppose I owe you,

13:55.084 --> 13:58.837
our country or any other beloved cause,

13:58.922 --> 14:01.089
I have already paid.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.386
I have paid in full, sir.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.937
So let me tell you what I will do.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.564
I will break me out of this cell.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.484
I will claim my gold and get filthy rich.

14:21.611 --> 14:26.698
Rich enough to buy your flat,
righteous blue behind

14:27.116 --> 14:31.912
just so I can kick it all day long.

14:38.127 --> 14:42.339
Captain, I'm finding it difficult to
reconcile the man on this piece of paper

14:42.757 --> 14:44.174
with the one I'm looking at.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.427
I suggest you find
the horse sense to accept my offer

14:47.512 --> 14:49.972
before I give in to my better judgment.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.937
Private, the man stays in the bull pit
till further notice.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Yes, sir!

15:01.818 --> 15:03.402
John?

15:03.486 --> 15:05.612
John?

15:06.489 --> 15:08.156
Sleepy-head.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.700
Supper's waiting for you.

15:24.716 --> 15:25.924
Hey, hey, hey!

15:26.009 --> 15:27.926
Hey! I gave you a bucket.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.595
I ain't going to tell you again.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.138
Use the...

15:36.144 --> 15:37.603
Colonel Powell!

15:37.687 --> 15:44.610
Colonel Powell!

15:44.694 --> 15:47.404
Sir, he stole your horse.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.535
No. Son of a...

15:54.370 --> 15:55.579
Carter!

16:22.732 --> 16:24.232
That's Domingo's band!

16:24.317 --> 16:25.984
Shut your damn mouth, Corporal.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.998
What's he saying, Carter?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.546
The hell's he saying now?

16:48.216 --> 16:49.341
What the hell's he saying, Carter?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.509
He's saying...

16:57.975 --> 16:59.059
Carter!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.453
I thought you didn't care!

17:18.913 --> 17:20.122
I don't!

17:44.647 --> 17:46.064
Get up! Come on.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.826
Give me a gun. Give me a gun!

18:14.135 --> 18:15.427
I've got to look.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.511
Cover me.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.700
The spider.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.421
This place sure ain't Apache.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.675
It sure ain't.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.567
Gold.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.408
Carter!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.160
Right behind you!

19:30.503 --> 19:31.503
Carter!

19:41.264 --> 19:46.977
Ock ohem ocktei

19:48.437 --> 19:49.604
wies.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.821
Barsoom.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.284
- What?
- Barsoom.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.327
Barsoom?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.595
Oh, gee!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.475
What the...

21:34.877 --> 21:36.378
No, no, no!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.472
Wha...

23:09.430 --> 23:11.473
Where the hell am I?

23:57.186 --> 23:58.311
What the...

23:59.522 --> 24:00.647
hell are you?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.445
Don't shoot him!

24:07.530 --> 24:08.780
Don't shoot!

24:12.660 --> 24:14.035
Don't shoot him!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.746
We should kill it, Jeddak.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.872
Move away.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.223
Hello.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.518
Don't run.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.728
Don't run away.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.398
Hello.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.650
Don't run.

24:48.028 --> 24:53.074
Alright.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.376
All right.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.753
You've got me.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.381
I surrender.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.050
Jeddak.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.596
- Jeddak?
- Jeddak.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.932
Tars Tarkas.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.770
Tars Tarkas?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.782
Captain John Carter, Virginia.

25:36.619 --> 25:40.038
Vorginia.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.458
Vorginia!

25:45.461 --> 25:47.212
No.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.632
My name is John Carter.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.218
I'm from Virginia.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.678
Virginia.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.805
Jump.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.141
Jump like you jumped before.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.768
Sack...

26:03.312 --> 26:04.354
Jump, yeah?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.147
Jump.

26:07.775 --> 26:08.983
Sack.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.693
Jump.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.153
Sack.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.696
Jump!

26:16.325 --> 26:18.159
Yes, sir.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.500
Virginia. Virginia.

26:26.669 --> 26:27.669
Don't!

26:29.672 --> 26:30.922
Don't shoot him!

26:31.006 --> 26:33.007
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!

26:40.474 --> 26:41.766
What is this place? Where am I?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.269
It's alright, Virginia. Be still.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.020
Where's my damn gold?

26:47.189 --> 26:48.856
Eighteen have yet to hatch, Jeddak.

26:48.941 --> 26:53.194
Then they are weak and not Thark.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.197
Leave nothing for the white apes.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.914
Where on Earth am I?

27:06.709 --> 27:10.336
Barsoom, a world on the brink.

27:11.380 --> 27:15.049
For Zodanga's new power
threatens to destroy our city of Helium.

27:15.884 --> 27:19.846
And if Helium falls, so does Barsoom.

27:23.017 --> 27:25.059
Rubbish.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.145
Goddess, help me, I'm hopeless.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.897
I always come on too strong.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.817
Your Highness.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.943
My Jeddak.

27:41.076 --> 27:46.539
After years of tireless research,
I present to you

27:49.418 --> 27:51.544
the answer.

27:56.050 --> 27:58.092
I hope.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.972
My Jeddak, after years of...

28:03.057 --> 28:05.016
I'm sorry, Princess.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.143
The presentation will have to wait.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.438
- Father, what's happened?
- Dejah!

28:16.987 --> 28:20.656
I know the terms set by Sab Than.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.910
What I want to know
is can we afford to reject them?

28:27.373 --> 28:28.706
Admiral Kantos Kan.

28:29.583 --> 28:32.126
The eastern border is a wasteland.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.128
Sab Than has burned
through our defenses,

28:34.296 --> 28:36.130
and the border folk will be massacred.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.300
Our best troops and fleetest ships

28:39.426 --> 28:41.302
are proven less than useless

28:41.553 --> 28:45.014
and now comes word that
our last remaining squadron

28:45.307 --> 28:46.682
has been lost.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.483
Helium is lost.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.443
My people.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.154
I have failed them all.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.490
No, my Jeddak, you haven't!

29:04.326 --> 29:07.578
Forgive me, my lady,
but you have not seen this weapon.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.498
It radiates the most intense, baleful

29:12.668 --> 29:14.001
blue light.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.509
When I read our reports
on Sab Than's weapon, I knew.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.846
Somehow that idiotic brute
had discovered it first.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.305
Discovered what?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.474
The Ninth Ray.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.102
Unlimited power.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.689
Sab Than only uses it for slaughter.

29:35.858 --> 29:39.485
But think of what Helium might
accomplish with such power.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.822
Transform the deserts, restore the seas.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.867
Is this what you saw, Kantos?

29:46.118 --> 29:48.995
It's starting to look very close.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.122
Give it time.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.915
It will work.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.725
Everyone, leave us.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.580
Dejah, ever since you were a little girl,

30:34.082 --> 30:36.751
you've always met the expectations
placed on you.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.926
It's Sab's terms.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.512
What are they?

30:49.598 --> 30:52.058
He will spare Helium

30:53.852 --> 30:56.604
if you accept his hand in marriage.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.857
No!

30:59.942 --> 31:00.983
He is a monster!

31:01.527 --> 31:02.527
You must refuse him!

31:02.611 --> 31:04.362
He's already on his way here.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.366
But all of my work...

31:08.450 --> 31:09.951
I just need a little more time.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.827
- Dejah!
- How can you...

31:11.912 --> 31:13.287
You can't just bow down to Zodanga!

31:13.497 --> 31:15.998
A wedding will save the city.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.875
Perhaps, but it could lose you Barsoom.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.043
Dejah!

31:19.127 --> 31:21.379
With no one to stop Zodanga,
it will be the beginning of the end!

31:21.463 --> 31:24.382
- We do not have the luxury...
- You are the Jeddak of Helium!

31:24.466 --> 31:25.883
You must find another way!

31:25.968 --> 31:27.552
There is no other way!

31:43.110 --> 31:47.154
If there were,
I would risk anything to seize it.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.492
This is the chance we have been given.

31:52.661 --> 31:56.330
Perhaps it is the will of the Goddess.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.084
No.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.962
It is your will.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.470
So, when I was little,
and we would look up at the stars

32:12.514 --> 32:16.183
and you would tell me of the heroes
whose glory was written in the sky,

32:17.686 --> 32:19.770
how there was a star up there for me,

32:25.694 --> 32:28.529
is this what you imagined
would be written on it?

32:37.122 --> 32:38.456
My Jeddak.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.541
Sab Than's corsair approaches the city.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.503
They signal for permission to land.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.050
Granted.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.932
And let us prepare ourselves
for a wedding.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.235
I have destroyed the device,
Matai Shang.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.446
She was on the verge of discovery.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.991
All is in place.
They will consent to the wedding.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.202
Keep close watch over her.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.080
We don't want anything to interfere
with our next move.

34:33.487 --> 34:34.487
Sarkoja!

34:35.072 --> 34:36.364
Let Sola have a hatchling.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.674
Sola can take the little white worm.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.387
Be still.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.597
Let go!

34:59.681 --> 35:01.682
Be still!

35:10.734 --> 35:12.067
What happened to you?

35:13.528 --> 35:15.154
Be still.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.123
Now we kill it.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.376
Step away, Tal Hajus.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.797
You prize this more highly than my judgment?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.882
Step...

35:35.425 --> 35:37.176
away.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.431
I claim the right of challenge!

35:42.557 --> 35:45.267
And who supports your challenge?

35:50.607 --> 35:55.402
Who will pledge their metal to mine?

36:07.082 --> 36:10.751
You are blind as a white ape, Tal Hajus.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.379
You will not rule today.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.715
Not today.

36:17.425 --> 36:22.596
See the prize your Jeddak has found!

36:23.181 --> 36:25.307
Is it... a baby white ape?

36:25.392 --> 36:26.851
No!

36:26.935 --> 36:29.061
It is a rare and valuable animal!

36:29.145 --> 36:31.730
It is called...

36:31.815 --> 36:33.274
it is called... Virginia!

36:33.608 --> 36:38.112
Virginia!

36:42.742 --> 36:44.118
Watch. Everyone, step back.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.205
Show them, Virginia.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.415
Jump.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.753
Jump!

37:09.394 --> 37:12.271
By lssus, you will jump tomorrow, Virginia.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.984
Sola, chain him.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.571
Tell Sarkoja to initiate him with the other hatchlings.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.156
Wait, wait, wait!

37:53.188 --> 37:57.191
I know. I know... Drink... Good...

38:06.576 --> 38:08.410
What's in that stuff?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.789
The voice of Barsoom.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.213
You can hear it if you choose.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.041
Easy.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.796
Nice monster dog.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.828
How the hell did you...

39:54.267 --> 39:56.018
Quit it!

40:22.962 --> 40:24.004
Stop it!

40:33.932 --> 40:36.016
You killed him with one blow.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.060
I...

40:38.144 --> 40:40.229
Wait.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.688
I understood you.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.530
What have you done?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.117
Get off!

40:54.702 --> 40:56.787
Get off him!

40:57.539 --> 40:58.664
How did this happen?

41:00.416 --> 41:02.251
Who is to blame?

41:04.420 --> 41:06.046
Woola.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.945
Do that again and I...

41:52.343 --> 41:53.677
Enough!

42:01.769 --> 42:05.981
There is no room
for another mark, Sola.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.903
Your next offense will be your last.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.127
You will jump, Virginia.

42:27.754 --> 42:28.795
Now.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.797
Jeddak! Fliers!

42:30.924 --> 42:32.799
You are the stones, the sand!

42:51.319 --> 42:53.654
Sir, they continue to ignore our signals.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.157
Enough! I've been patient.
I'll not be mocked.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.325
Let them die!

43:01.454 --> 43:04.456
If that's how you plan
to treat your future bride,

43:04.540 --> 43:06.583
it's no wonder she ran from you.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.628
Dejah Thoris must live.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.754
In range, sir.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.673
You need only cripple the ship.

43:12.966 --> 43:15.592
A pulse to the radium drive
will be sufficient.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.679
Quick, clean, and precise.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.973
Jeddak, shall we destroy her?

43:21.683 --> 43:22.808
No.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.434
We need only cripple her.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.727
Now bring us around.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.187
Zodanga.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.356
- Helium.
- Helium.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.691
Helium.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.150
Zodanga.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.528
They are the red flag, Helium the blue.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.780
Zodanga's winning the war,

43:36.864 --> 43:41.159
but I say let red men kill red men
until only Tharks remain.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.047
That don't look like a fair fight.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.049
Zodanga never fights fair.

44:03.099 --> 44:04.308
Where is she?

44:04.559 --> 44:05.809
My Jeddak, that's all of them.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.644
She can't have just
vanished into thin air.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.271
- Check the dead.
- We have, sire.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.064
Then check them again.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.074
To the bridge, now!

44:27.915 --> 44:29.041
Look out!

44:42.847 --> 44:44.014
She's a human!

44:46.642 --> 44:48.268
Sola!

44:56.110 --> 44:57.152
Who is that?

44:57.945 --> 44:59.821
I bet Virginia.

45:03.785 --> 45:04.868
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.287
If you'll kindly just stand behind me.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.122
This might get dangerous.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.103
Or maybe I ought to get behind you.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.984
You let me know
when it gets dangerous.

46:24.365 --> 46:25.782
No.

46:26.701 --> 46:27.909
Take him alive.

46:28.244 --> 46:31.371
What's the point of having this thing
if I don't get to use it?

46:34.876 --> 46:35.959
Leave him!

46:57.231 --> 46:58.273
What are you?

46:59.150 --> 47:01.818
You aren't red man nor quite white ape!

47:04.071 --> 47:05.697
No matter.

47:05.781 --> 47:07.073
You can still bleed like...

47:08.701 --> 47:09.826
Tharks!

47:10.036 --> 47:12.037
Fire!

47:20.922 --> 47:22.255
I surrender.

47:22.632 --> 47:24.716
You may take me captive.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.435
Prepare to turn about!

47:45.363 --> 47:47.155
Did I not tell you he could jump?

47:47.448 --> 47:49.157
Oh, my God.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.036
Let go! Bad dog!

47:53.120 --> 47:56.289
You are ugly, but you are beautiful.

47:56.749 --> 47:58.875
And you fight like a Thark.

48:02.255 --> 48:04.464
You lost your wager. You must pay.

48:05.967 --> 48:08.009
Jeddak of the Tharks.

48:10.513 --> 48:12.639
I am Dejah Thoris,

48:12.932 --> 48:15.559
regent of the Royal Helium
Academy of Science.

48:15.643 --> 48:18.395
- My research vessel...
- Your share of the spoils.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.647
Sola! Tend to Virginia's property.

48:20.773 --> 48:21.856
Yes, my Jeddak!

48:22.024 --> 48:24.109
You know once Sab Than
has conquered us,

48:24.193 --> 48:25.986
he will turn his weapon upon you!

48:26.153 --> 48:29.739
I know that Zodanga
has found a way to defeat you

48:29.991 --> 48:33.451
and now you seek
a mighty weapon of your own.

48:33.786 --> 48:36.871
But Virginia fights for us!

48:37.873 --> 48:41.167
He'll fight the Torquas in the south...

48:41.752 --> 48:44.129
the Warhoon in the north

48:44.213 --> 48:48.049
and he will be called Dotar Sojat,

48:48.134 --> 48:49.426
my right arms!

48:51.262 --> 48:52.721
No.

48:56.392 --> 48:58.476
I don't fight for anyone.

49:05.943 --> 49:09.029
Virginia, reject this honor

49:09.405 --> 49:13.241
and I cannot guarantee
the safety of your red girl.

49:24.337 --> 49:27.881
I am.

49:30.176 --> 49:32.260
Dotar Sojat!

49:34.680 --> 49:36.723
To the plunder!

50:05.586 --> 50:07.712
War is a shameful thing.

50:11.842 --> 50:15.470
Not when a noble cause is taken up
by those who can make a difference.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.018
You made a difference today, Virginia.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.772
Okay.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.525
See, my name is John Carter.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.194
Virginia is where I'm from.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.905
Where did you learn to jump that way?

50:34.115 --> 50:35.949
I don't know.

50:36.075 --> 50:37.659
How'd you learn to fly?

50:38.744 --> 50:42.455
Your ships cannot sail
on light in Virginia?

50:42.957 --> 50:44.457
No, Professor.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.668
See, our ships sail the seas.

50:50.423 --> 50:52.340
Endless water everywhere.

50:59.265 --> 51:00.598
Skeletal structure normal.

51:00.683 --> 51:02.225
What are you doing?

51:02.309 --> 51:04.394
Must be the density of your bones.

51:05.187 --> 51:07.188
- Jump for me.
- Enough!

51:07.481 --> 51:09.691
There will be time for playfulness later.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.860
I want no playfulness from him.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.194
I want his help.

51:14.196 --> 51:15.989
Explain to me how you do it.

51:17.491 --> 51:20.076
If it's a skill, teach it to Helium.

51:20.953 --> 51:24.289
- Name your price.
- I'm not for hire.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.210
I've got a cave of gold of my own.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.795
Somewhere.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.883
Only a madman would rave
about the time of oceans.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.010
Is that your expert view?

51:37.094 --> 51:39.429
- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.931
She is a good match for you,
Dotar Sojat.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.308
Don't call me that.

51:43.726 --> 51:45.560
There are no seas on the planet.

51:49.064 --> 51:50.523
You said "planet."

51:53.986 --> 51:55.945
Sun, then Rasoom.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.197
Mercury.

51:57.281 --> 51:59.365
Then Cosoom.

52:00.075 --> 52:02.285
Venus.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.828
Then Earth... us.

52:05.748 --> 52:07.832
That is Jasoom.

52:08.250 --> 52:11.211
You are on Barsoom, John Carter.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.922
Mars.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.216
I'm on Mars?

52:29.104 --> 52:31.022
Good God.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.191
I'm on Mars.

52:35.945 --> 52:38.905
So, now home is Jasoom

52:39.281 --> 52:41.366
and you came on one
of your sailing ships

52:41.450 --> 52:43.493
across millions
of karads of empty space?

52:43.619 --> 52:46.246
No. Not like that.

52:46.956 --> 52:49.666
Go on, shock me.

52:49.834 --> 52:50.917
How?

52:53.712 --> 52:55.797
That brought me here.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.807
Oh.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.143
Well, that explains everything, then.

53:10.312 --> 53:13.064
- It does?
- Yes.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.357
You're a Thern

53:15.276 --> 53:17.068
and you simply
wish to return to your rightful place.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.152
Isn't that it?

53:18.362 --> 53:19.487
Yes.

53:19.572 --> 53:21.489
Then let's sort this out right now.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.783
Come along!

53:32.126 --> 53:33.710
Where are you going?

53:33.794 --> 53:34.961
To your temple.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.048
No. No, you cannot enter here.

53:41.135 --> 53:42.802
It is forbidden!

53:43.470 --> 53:44.888
You are not Thark!

53:46.557 --> 53:47.724
Woola, stay!

54:07.494 --> 54:08.912
Dotar Sojat.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.163
It is forbidden.

54:10.289 --> 54:11.289
It is forbidden!

54:12.833 --> 54:15.501
Well, you speak for the Goddess.

54:17.338 --> 54:18.630
What does she say?

54:22.009 --> 54:23.593
You called me a Thern.

54:24.136 --> 54:25.511
Is that what she is?

54:25.930 --> 54:28.431
No, she is Issus.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.892
Therns are holy messengers
of the Goddess.

54:30.976 --> 54:33.853
In the time of oceans,
they walked among us, guiding us.

54:34.605 --> 54:35.605
We must not offend.

54:36.148 --> 54:37.732
Let us go.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.236
There's some kind of writing up there.

54:58.003 --> 55:00.755
- Can you read it?
- It's old scripture.

55:00.839 --> 55:02.799
There it is again.

55:02.883 --> 55:05.468
- What's it mean?
- Don't rush me.

55:05.552 --> 55:08.054
"Those who seek the solace of eternity"

55:08.639 --> 55:11.057
"may journey down the river"

55:11.183 --> 55:12.976
"through the sacred Gates of Iss"

55:13.060 --> 55:15.520
"and find everlasting peace"

55:15.604 --> 55:17.063
"in the bosom of Issus."

55:19.358 --> 55:21.442
The Gates of Iss.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.408
What if I could take you there?

55:34.581 --> 55:36.708
What if I didn't trust you?

55:38.585 --> 55:40.670
Then we'd be even.

55:42.339 --> 55:46.175
I can take you to the Gates,
to the answers that you seek.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.012
A way back to Jasoom.

55:49.096 --> 55:50.930
- Earth.
- Earth.

55:51.432 --> 55:53.933
It's the least I could do
to repay you for getting us out of here.

55:56.270 --> 55:57.687
Assuming that you can.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.361
Deal.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.284
Go on.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.785
You shake it.

56:12.870 --> 56:13.911
As a sign of trust.

56:17.416 --> 56:18.833
Good enough.

56:24.757 --> 56:28.634
Now all I need to do
is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.763
Dotar Sojat?

56:33.307 --> 56:35.349
Useless she-calot.

56:38.645 --> 56:39.812
I told you.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.647
It is forbidden.

56:48.197 --> 56:50.406
What in the name of Issus is going on?

56:50.491 --> 56:51.991
Issus has been profaned.

56:52.076 --> 56:54.827
We found this one and the red wench
plotting in the temple.

56:54.995 --> 56:56.913
In the temple? How did they get...

56:56.997 --> 56:58.873
Sola led them there.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.042
Sola tried to stop us.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.586
I meant no disrespect
to your goddess, Tars.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.004
I'm just trying to get home.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.340
Your right arms were planning
to rob you of the medallion

57:07.758 --> 57:11.344
and use it to commit greater blasphemy
down the River Iss.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.429
They must all die in the arena.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.517
How could you do this?
I spared your life.

57:18.310 --> 57:22.021
I made you Dotar Sojat
yet her life means nothing to you.

57:22.481 --> 57:26.234
You knew... You knew
she had no room for another mark.

57:26.401 --> 57:29.529
Now Sola will die because of you.

57:31.406 --> 57:34.075
She's your daughter, isn't she?

57:41.708 --> 57:43.167
Who told you that?

57:43.418 --> 57:45.128
Call it a father's intuition.

57:45.379 --> 57:47.213
A Thark has no parent but the horde.

57:47.548 --> 57:48.881
But how do you know?

57:51.260 --> 57:53.136
Her mother kept her egg

57:53.220 --> 57:56.180
and Sola's the last flicker
of her ancient greatness.

57:56.265 --> 57:57.890
You can't just stand here
and let her be killed.

58:01.395 --> 58:03.104
My right arms offend me.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.856
I will cut them off.

58:08.277 --> 58:09.652
No.

58:12.781 --> 58:14.991
You must hurry. I mean to release you.

58:16.243 --> 58:18.244
I make one condition.

58:18.704 --> 58:21.622
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

58:21.707 --> 58:22.915
My Jeddak.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.294
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess

58:26.378 --> 58:28.963
than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

58:29.965 --> 58:31.924
Where you go, she goes.

58:32.092 --> 58:33.509
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?

58:33.594 --> 58:37.096
Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

58:42.603 --> 58:43.978
Is it done, my Jeddak?

58:48.609 --> 58:50.610
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

58:53.822 --> 58:55.114
Woola!

58:55.449 --> 58:56.866
You belong to him.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.619
Woola would follow you
anywhere on Barsoom.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.705
It's three days' ride. Follow me.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.430
What happened to this place?

59:19.640 --> 59:21.641
Zodanga happened.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.315
Sailing on light.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.070
Still playing the madman?

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:19.198
Or the liar.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.923
Keep moving! We'll get there!

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.474
Why pursue this wedding
any longer? I've already won.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.602
Not yet. You must aim past the horizon,
Sab Than.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:53.065
To truly demoralize a nation requires a
public spectacle on the grandest scale.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.235
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.945
If you insist.

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:02.325
If you cannot see the wisdom in that,
then we will find another who can.

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:19.050
Dotar Sojat.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.345
Carter!

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.388
I do not think she leads us to the Iss.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.230
All right, then, Sola.

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.399
Just play along.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.738
What do you think I'd do
once I saw your city and not some river?

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.698
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.284
They should be at our backs by now.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.244
You lead us toward Helium!

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.250
Once we reach there,

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.379
you would see for yourself
the virtue of our cause.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:01.258
Everyone thinks
their cause is virtuous... Professor.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.469
What are you doing?

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:09.558
No!

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:11.310
John Carter!

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.437
You can't!

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:14.897
I like this plan better.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.816
Just wait.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.317
She'll come around.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.361
You mad fool!

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.823
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:26.784
I only told you what you wanted to hear
so you'd get us out!

01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:28.911
Stop!

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:29.995
I can't!

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.415
I cannot marry him!

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.711
Can't marry who?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.341
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.427
Sab Than.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:47.930
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.974
Your father?

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:52.101
Tardos Mors.

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.354
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.774
A princess of Mars.

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.360
How about that?

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:06.449
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.033
No.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.870
Is that all there is to the story?

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:13.831
No, I didn't run away!

01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:17.251
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.545
So marry the guy and save your people.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.214
A life of oppression! That's not living!

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.477
If you had the means to save others,

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.229
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.025
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.738
I would lay down my life for Helium.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:53.245
Yes, I ran away.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.706
I was afraid,

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.083
weak.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.922
Maybe I should have married.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:10.763
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:18.062
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.607
there are no Gates of Iss.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:23.901
They are not real.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.285
I'm sorry, Princess.

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:39.124
But this, this is real.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.464
And so is my cave of gold.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:04:59.687
Prudence demands you take an escort.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.063
No.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.148
I go alone, General.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:05.568
But, Jeddak...

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:08.946
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.156
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:16.370
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.710
I'm starting to talk like you.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.472
Hekkador, they have reached the lss.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:37.057
It took them longer than I thought.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:38.183
If they reach the Gates...

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.476
They can breach the sanctuary.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.478
Her knowledge
of the Ninth Ray is already...

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:43.397
As advanced as it will ever be.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.648
Patience, brothers.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.900
It is under my control.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.695
I'm already there.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.961
The Iss.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.173
Here, pilgrims must leave
behind all they have,

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:13.177
all they know,

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.012
never to return.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.434
May the Goddess find me worthy.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.485
Wait!

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:33.405
What do you think you're doing?

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.909
It is my way, Dotar Sojat, not yours.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.995
I must honor my Jeddak
and redeem my unworthiness!

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.540
You want to honor your father?
Then stay alive and help me.

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.504
My father?

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.007
Sola...

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.760
Why would you say that?

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.221
That's what drives your compassion,

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.891
the blood of your father, Tars Tarkas.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:05.938
And of all the Tharks,
you're the only one worthy of him.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.827
Your duty to your father
demands that you see me through.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.039
Just help me find the Gates.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:27.000
Then you can decide
what honor requires.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.298
Just to the Gates, then.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.803
Woola, stay!

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.341
Other pilgrims.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:30.773
Professor.

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:36.694
Impossible.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.287
I've never seen
this kind of structure before.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.709
I want to get a better look.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.060
Carter, your feet.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.947
This is not the work of gods.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.951
These are machines.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:19.840
Your medallion.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.780
A spider.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:52.915
Nine.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.792
Nine rays.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.836
Nine.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.421
The Ninth Ray is real.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.881
It can be harnessed. Do you see?

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:03.842
This entire structure runs
on Ninth Ray isolates.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.595
Mother Issus!

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.805
Such power.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.351
And somehow Zodanga has it.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.607
The Therns.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:22.027
They must be real.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:23.695
And you

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.493
are John Carter of Earth?

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.579
Yes, ma'am.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.127
And the ships

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.172
that sail on the sea.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.218
You've seen them.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.430
That must be a beautiful sight.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.516
It truly is.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.652
It's our solar system.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.792
- What's it say?
- I'm not sure.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:20.460
What do you think it says?

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.964
It appears to be
a kind of technical diagram.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:27.259
Here is Barsoom. There is Jasoom.

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:29.344
This glyph here,

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:33.348
it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy,

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.852
sent along these lines here,
between the worlds.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.145
Like...

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.230
A telegram.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.150
You're saying I was telegraphed here.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.403
I'm a copy of myself.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:50.365
Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:57.664
I don't like guessing.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.834
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:03.503
Right.

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:05.589
And where might we find those?

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.426
In the Hall of Science.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.180
And where's that?

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.390
Helium.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:19.478
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:20.979
What do you take me for?

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:23.398
I take you for a man who's lost.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.026
I won't be lost if you just tell me
how to work this thing!

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.152
I will!

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.988
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.991
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.618
Isn't that what you want?

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.036
Yes.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:40.540
No.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.127
I don't believe you.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.714
We may have been born worlds apart,

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.886
but I know you, John Carter.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:57.432
From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:02.896
I felt the heart of a man
willing to lay down his life for others,

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.818
a man willing to fight for a cause.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.571
Here.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.200
On Barsoom.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.224
Don't you see, Carter?

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.645
I fled to find another way.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.112
You are the other way.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:57.075
Dotar Sojat!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.919
Warhoon!

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:19.598
Dotar Sojat!

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.940
Pursue them to the Aoolian Plain.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.110
Then overtake them
and capture the red woman alive.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.362
The one who jumps?

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.406
Let's see what he's capable of.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:27.832
Sarah!

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:34.756
Dotar Sojat!

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.342
- What are you doing?
- Sola, get her out of here.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.511
Carter!

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:41.554
I was too late once.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.640
I won't be again.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.725
No! No!

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.353
No!

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.855
No!

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:55.860
Woola, go.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.613
Go, damn you!

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:23.573
Father!

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.453
Thank the Goddess!

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:29.788
Carter.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.044
Oh, thank Issus.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:37.462
Who is he?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.507
His name's John Carter.
He saved my life.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.761
He's from Jasoom.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.263
Jasoom!

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:50.975
Zodanga's closer.
He'll have my personal physician.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:53.686
He shot me out of the sky!

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:55.814
Daughter, listen to me! Listen.

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.817
Sab has admitted to everything.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.903
He came to me, alone,
without an escort.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.863
I could have had him imprisoned.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:05.740
I could have had him killed.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.326
Yet, it was clear he only cared
about your safety.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:12.997
I feared you'd be tortured by the Tharks
and condemned to die in their arena.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.709
I could not live with that
on my conscience.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.378
I do have one, Princess.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.338
Really?

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.382
I thought you had it
removed along with...

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.593
She does not trust me, Jeddak.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:27.220
And why should she?

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:30.098
There's never been trust
between Zodanga and Helium.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:31.933
Therefore, Princess,

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.936
I offer you this small
but sincere token of my goodwill.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:43.862
My life.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.374
You hold the power, Princess.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:01.212
The power of life over me
and over all Barsoom.

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:06.676
With our two cities united,
anything is possible.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:11.347
All you have to do is marry me.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:45.340
Is this Helium?

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.300
No.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:54.140
Zodanga, where the men
are as limited as the menu

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.685
and the women are as hard as the beds.

01:20:57.811 --> 01:20:59.604
What's your business here?

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.189
He is my business.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:04.192
The Jasoomian is to be taken
to more secure accommodation.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.027
We've received no such orders!

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:07.612
You're receiving them now!

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:11.616
Straight from the laughing lips
of Sab Than himself.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:19.666
I hear that you
are incredibly dangerous.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.793
Take me hostage.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:24.837
- What?
- Take me hostage.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:28.967
Are you all right?

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:34.222
No! The white imbecile
has taken my sword!

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.353
Guards!

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:42.939
Carter! Run!

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.234
There's a crazy man
running amok with a sword!

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:47.318
Carter, this way!

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.618
Right, your turn.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.495
- My turn?
- Yeah.

01:21:57.705 --> 01:22:00.081
- Who are you?
- My name is Kantos Kan.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:01.708
I serve Princess Dejah.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.084
Dejah?

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:08.506
And from what she tells me,
you can get us over there.

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.847
She said I could make that?

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.516
We could always surrender.

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:19.601
Quickly!

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.686
Is that what you do on Jasoom?

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.272
Come on!

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.248
Hello, ladies.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.805
You are expected
to bow in my presence, Captain Carter.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:02.685
Bow.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.151
I suppose that will do.

01:23:12.363 --> 01:23:14.364
I fetched him, as you commanded.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:15.823
Thank you, Kantos.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.493
I wish to speak to Captain Carter alone.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:20.411
Keep watch outside.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:25.208
Now, girls. Off you go!

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:41.182
You look beautiful.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.309
It's traditional Zodangan,

01:23:43.394 --> 01:23:45.311
worn by the groom's mother, I'm told.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:47.522
A little vulgar for my taste,

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.607
but my opinions
are about to become irrelevant.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.776
You can't seriously be considering this.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.195
- What other choice do I have?
- Don't marry him.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.280
Give me a reason not to.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:06.075
Will you stay and fight for Helium?

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:19.929
Dejah.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:23.850
We have a saying on Barsoom.

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:30.440
A warrior may change his metal,
but not his heart.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.821
You were right.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.159
I could decipher the command.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.536
It's a set of sounds.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.831
A simple phrase.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.334
Repeat after me.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:53.546
Ock, ohem, ocktei...

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.923
Open the door!

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:02.180
Say it now. Ock, ohem, ocktei.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:06.434
Are you all right, Dejah?

01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:07.518
Ock,

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.604
ohem,

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.358
ocktei.

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.568
Wies.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:20.823
- Wies.
- Jasoom.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:22.617
Jasoom. Say it.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.660
- Say it. Say it!
- Ja...

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.039
Dejah? Are you alone?

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.886
Yes.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.848
I am alone.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.856
Well, my Jeddak.

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.235
The moons will soon be rising.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:01.239
Let us not delay
the proceedings any further.

01:26:04.535 --> 01:26:05.868
Yes.

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:09.080
Yes, of course.

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:47.785
Ssh.

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.414
We'll have plenty of time to talk.

01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:57.795
Now.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:04.760
Who are you?

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:07.430
- American.
- Who are you, sir?

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.809
"Sir." Definitely the South.

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.396
The Carolinas? Virginia?

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:19.066
It's Virginia, isn't it?

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.485
- Lovely place.
- Do you know it?

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:24.614
Not as well as I should. But I will.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:32.914
Padwar, what's the hold-up?

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.790
Sorry, sir. The streets are blocked.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.167
It's the wedding procession.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.840
Increased strength and agility.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.427
Simple matter
of gravitation and anatomy,

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.095
one we ought to have foreseen.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.639
We?

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.683
No apparent increase in intelligence.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:56.896
Still, this will not do at all.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:00.858
We can't have Earthmen
projecting themselves over here,

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:03.694
leaping about, causing
all manner of disruption.

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.989
You're a Thern.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.283
Therns are a myth.

01:28:10.661 --> 01:28:12.536
Padwar, we'll go on foot.

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:13.788
Yes, sir.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.385
My name is Matai Shang,
and I do not exist.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:31.222
Indeed, I work very hard at it.

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:36.894
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.861
Many pardons, many pardons.

01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:03.170
It's a shame, really.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:06.716
She's a remarkable creature,
and she came very close indeed.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.135
You mean the Ninth Ray.

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.389
It's of no consequence now.

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:15.725
After tonight's ceremony,

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:19.103
when the two moons meet
and vows are exchanged,

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:22.189
she and anyone else with
knowledge of the Ninth Ray

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:24.275
will be eliminated.

01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:27.403
In effect, cutting the head off the beast.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:31.073
Quick, clean and precise.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:37.204
Shame there's no one to warn her.

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.306
The balance must be restored.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.524
What gives you the right to interfere?

01:30:05.609 --> 01:30:08.527
What do you care?
This is not your home.

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.572
You have no obligation to these people.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:15.618
You don't have a dog in this fight.

01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:18.162
Is that how you would say it in Virginia?

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:20.289
Man without a cause.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.843
So what is your cause?

01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:37.723
We have none.

01:30:38.809 --> 01:30:41.519
We're not haunted by mortality
as you are.

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:45.981
We are eternal.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.609
I don't understand.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.861
The wedding, this little stroll.

01:30:51.822 --> 01:30:53.989
Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:57.201
History will follow
the course we have set, Earthman.

01:30:57.911 --> 01:31:00.412
And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.

01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:04.166
The Ninth Ray
must remain in the hands

01:31:04.251 --> 01:31:06.544
of mindless brutes we can control.

01:31:08.547 --> 01:31:12.341
And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:17.888
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:21.308
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

01:31:23.395 --> 01:31:26.689
We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.483
We simply manage it,

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.236
feed off it, if you like.

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:37.575
But on every host planet, it always
plays out exactly the same way.

01:31:38.577 --> 01:31:42.413
Populations rise, societies divide,

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:45.583
wars spread.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:49.086
And all the while

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.506
the neglected planet slowly fades.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:03.809
Prep a two-man flier immediately
for prisoner transport.

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:05.603
Yes, sir.

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.287
Immortal ain't bulletproof.

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:25.789
I shot one of you back on Earth.

01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:33.797
Oh, come on.

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.889
I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.099
Guards! After him!

01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:55.170
Woola!

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.674
I told you Woola would
follow you anywhere.

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:02.177
He did a lot more than just that.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.890
Wait! Wait!

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.559
Where are you going?

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.311
To save Dejah.

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:11.520
And I'll need an army to do it.

01:34:12.897 --> 01:34:14.064
Get on.

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:17.818
No! Tharks do not fly.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.009
Gayor.

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:52.936
Tars! They're going to kill.

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:56.440
Dejah.

01:34:56.775 --> 01:34:59.401
Issus truly rewards the just.

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:15.417
- I see the dead.
- Tars?

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:20.464
The Virginia I knew

01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:24.176
traveled the Iss.

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:27.304
What have they done to you?

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.557
Tal challenged.

01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:32.434
I lost.

01:35:34.604 --> 01:35:36.188
Virginia.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:40.150
When I saw you leap into the sky,

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:43.987
I wished to believe it was a sign

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.199
that something new
can come into this world,

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:52.955
that the greatness of our Thark race
might rise again.

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:57.000
But it is too late.

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:01.296
- Tars.
- No matter.

01:36:02.048 --> 01:36:04.466
My daughter is with
her mother in Paradise.

01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:06.552
There is comfort in that.

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:11.807
Tars, it's Sola.

01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:16.478
Actually, she's here with me.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:25.529
This is how you repay your debt to me?

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.905
I need my sword.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:30.117
Then it would harvest
your thoughtless head from your body!

01:36:43.965 --> 01:36:45.966
Up now! We go!

01:36:50.805 --> 01:36:52.514
It is done.

01:36:52.599 --> 01:36:54.057
Nonsense.

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:57.519
"Leave a Thark his head and one hand,
and he may yet conquer."

01:36:57.604 --> 01:36:59.021
Right?

01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:01.106
Your spirit annoys me.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.833
All this your work?

01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.044
Banths.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.636
Weakness.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.679
Sentiment.

01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:37.392
Allowing this white worm
to contaminate the horde.

01:37:38.478 --> 01:37:41.647
These are the crimes of Tars Tarkas.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:46.735
We are united
because we cull our freaks.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:51.365
We are strong
because we despise weakness.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:38:01.875
Let them be crushed
like unhatched eggs.

01:38:19.185 --> 01:38:20.936
Is that a banth?

01:38:21.062 --> 01:38:22.396
No.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.189
It is a white ape.

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:28.318
Run!

01:38:30.488 --> 01:38:33.115
Tars! Get up! Tars!

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:35.033
Give me your hand!
You have four damn hands!

01:38:35.118 --> 01:38:36.285
Give me one!

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:42.457
- Father!
- Father?

01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:48.589
Tars! Tars!

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:50.632
Hey!

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:55.679
Hey! Hey, over here, you blind monkey!

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.700
Release the other one.

01:39:34.177 --> 01:39:38.013
Watch your father die
like the whimpering calot he is!

01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:42.309
No! Let us watch you!

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:53.737
Sola! Are you mad?

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:56.531
No. The blood of my father drives me.

01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:52.045
Sola!

01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:24.327
Virginia! Virginia!
Virginia! Virginia!

01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:35.505
I claim the right of challenge!

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:44.055
You have no right to challenge!

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:45.766
You are not Thark!

01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:48.602
He is Thark!

01:41:48.686 --> 01:41:51.104
He is Dotar Sojat!

01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:55.942
Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.197
Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:06.453
Who will pledge their metal to mine?

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.450
The Jeddak of Zodanga
means to crush Helium this very night.

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:47.911
And if Helium falls,

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:51.665
so does Barsoom.

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:55.085
We must throw off
the yoke of old hatreds.

01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:57.921
Tharks did not cause this.

01:42:59.257 --> 01:43:02.425
But, by Issus, Tharks will end it!

01:43:06.848 --> 01:43:08.932
We ride for Zodanga!

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.293
I know that this is not the fate
you would have chosen for yourself,

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:38.253
or for Helium,

01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:42.132
but choice is a luxury
even for a Jeddak of Barsoom.

01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:45.385
Even if, in your heart...

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:47.470
A heart is a luxury.

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.976
Steady.

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:57.647
Remember, she is not the prize.

01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:01.902
The prize is Barsoom.

01:44:23.549 --> 01:44:24.841
You!

01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:26.718
Why is Zodanga undefended?

01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:28.678
Where is everyone?

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:31.264
The army has been repositioned
outside Helium.

01:44:31.349 --> 01:44:33.141
Only a small contingent remains.

01:44:33.225 --> 01:44:35.352
Sab and Dejah Thoris. Where are they?

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.355
They're at the wedding in Helium!

01:44:38.648 --> 01:44:40.148
Helium?

01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:02.337
No! I have made my decision.

01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:04.172
It's the only way to get there in time.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:06.800
Tharks do not fly.

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:09.886
So be it.

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:18.478
This is madness, Dotar Sojat. You'll die!

01:45:21.232 --> 01:45:23.400
Then I'll see you down the River Iss.

01:45:24.735 --> 01:45:26.695
Follow the canal!

01:45:26.779 --> 01:45:29.823
Be careful!
The moonlight will force you to fly low!

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:43.336
Like our ancestors before us,

01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:48.591
we gather under the mingled light
of Barsoom's first lovers,

01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:51.553
Cluros and Thuria.

01:46:15.911 --> 01:46:19.122
As the moons
are joined in celestial union,

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:23.668
so do we unite
Sab Than and Dejah Thoris,

01:46:24.253 --> 01:46:27.005
Zodanga and Helium.

01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:43.813
No! You'll raise the alarm.
It's one of ours.

01:46:53.866 --> 01:46:55.408
In the time of oceans,

01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:58.828
the celestial lovers
rose from the sea each night

01:46:58.913 --> 01:47:00.872
to consummate their love in the sky.

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:04.334
Drink now
of this holy water and be wed.

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:06.419
So may it be again.

01:47:07.838 --> 01:47:09.839
I am yours forever.

01:47:16.931 --> 01:47:18.932
And I am yours

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.185
forever.

01:47:28.025 --> 01:47:29.234
Carter!

01:47:31.237 --> 01:47:33.321
It's a trap! Zodanga's at your walls!

01:47:33.405 --> 01:47:34.739
Now! Do it now!

01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:37.242
- No!
- Helium falls!

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:56.094
Zodanga!

01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:13.194
Dejah!

01:48:22.079 --> 01:48:23.746
If you'll just get behind me, sir.

01:48:30.171 --> 01:48:31.629
Carter!

01:48:44.935 --> 01:48:47.270
- It was such a nice wedding.
- Yeah, that.

01:48:57.948 --> 01:49:00.033
Helium's fate is sealed, Earthman.

01:49:00.117 --> 01:49:01.618
As is yours.

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:12.462
Thank the Goddess that's over with.

01:49:21.305 --> 01:49:22.847
Virginia!

01:49:28.145 --> 01:49:29.854
It is good to fly!

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:36.486
By Issus, they fight with us!

01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:55.838
Brother!

01:49:55.923 --> 01:49:57.924
Heliumite, huh?

01:50:15.192 --> 01:50:17.568
You're going to tell me everything
you know about the Therns.

01:50:17.653 --> 01:50:20.613
You spare me and I'll tell you.

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.356
A fitting solution for your setback,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.484
Dejah Thoris survives her assassins

01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:00.153
but will fail to prove
her misguided theory

01:51:00.237 --> 01:51:02.238
of the Ninth Ray.

01:51:02.323 --> 01:51:03.656
Yes.

01:51:04.408 --> 01:51:06.409
I'll enjoy playing that out.

01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:08.077
Carter!

01:51:11.749 --> 01:51:12.999
Dejah!

01:51:14.752 --> 01:51:16.169
I'm getting away!

01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:32.352
Tars.

01:51:32.478 --> 01:51:34.020
The medallion.

01:51:34.605 --> 01:51:36.272
Give it to me, my Jeddak.

01:51:44.323 --> 01:51:45.448
No!

01:52:05.177 --> 01:52:06.761
I'll explain later.

01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:16.562
You have won, my Jeddak.

01:52:18.982 --> 01:52:20.817
All is finished.

01:52:25.489 --> 01:52:26.948
Not quite.

01:52:35.874 --> 01:52:37.417
A Jeddak.

01:52:37.501 --> 01:52:39.502
I see you have changed your metal.

01:52:41.839 --> 01:52:43.381
And my heart.

01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:55.351
Dejah Thoris,

01:52:58.522 --> 01:53:01.357
would a princess of Mars
ever consider marriage

01:53:01.442 --> 01:53:05.069
to a wayward Virginia cavalryman

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.615
with nothing to offer?

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:10.908
Yes,

01:53:12.953 --> 01:53:14.954
John Carter.

01:53:16.081 --> 01:53:17.373
Yes!

01:53:26.091 --> 01:53:29.010
By the ancient rite
of moons and water

01:53:30.429 --> 01:53:32.430
are you bound together,

01:53:34.391 --> 01:53:36.392
husband and wife.

01:54:02.503 --> 01:54:04.504
John?

01:54:26.818 --> 01:54:28.945
Homesick for the Thark nursery?

01:54:30.447 --> 01:54:32.532
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

01:54:34.117 --> 01:54:36.118
I had that feeling you get, suddenly,

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:40.790
that you left a light burning

01:54:43.168 --> 01:54:45.294
or a door open.

01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:53.135
Go back to bed.

01:54:53.512 --> 01:54:55.638
I won't be long.

01:55:03.689 --> 01:55:05.731
Be back in one xat,

01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:08.317
John Carter of Earth.

01:55:24.209 --> 01:55:26.210
Come.

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.701
John Carter of Earth.

01:56:12.382 --> 01:56:13.633
Yup.

01:56:15.427 --> 01:56:19.555
John Carter of Mars
sounds much better.

01:56:24.978 --> 01:56:28.564
Sire, I must express the deepest
of gratitude for saving Helium.

01:56:28.649 --> 01:56:30.608
Please. The honor is mine.

01:56:30.734 --> 01:56:32.943
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.

01:56:33.153 --> 01:56:35.905
Ock ohem ocktei wies Jasoom.

01:56:55.425 --> 01:56:57.510
No, no.

01:57:00.013 --> 01:57:01.847
No.

01:57:02.182 --> 01:57:03.474
Powell?

01:57:12.776 --> 01:57:13.859
No!

01:57:26.123 --> 01:57:34.123
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

01:57:42.514 --> 01:57:45.307
Bars... Barsoom.

01:57:50.647 --> 01:57:54.775
50 million miles apart
and no way to bridge the gap.

01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:58.320
No way to return my body
and my soul to their true home.

01:57:59.239 --> 01:58:02.074
Like a fool,
I had thrown away my medallion.

01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:06.871
Then I recalled Matai Shang.

01:58:06.997 --> 01:58:09.498
His knowledge of Earth, of my history.

01:58:09.666 --> 01:58:11.917
It meant Therns
were a presence on this world.

01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:14.003
The cave in Arizona was proof.

01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:17.798
There might be other such proofs,
other Thern way stations

01:58:17.883 --> 01:58:19.717
hidden all around the world.

01:58:19.843 --> 01:58:23.095
I knew now what the cave
of gold must be used for.

01:58:23.346 --> 01:58:26.182
So for ten bitter years, I searched.

01:58:26.349 --> 01:58:28.017
On the trail of rumor and legend

01:58:28.101 --> 01:58:31.103
I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns,

01:58:31.188 --> 01:58:33.063
but I found no medallion.

01:58:35.233 --> 01:58:38.235
And then it came to me.

01:58:43.074 --> 01:58:45.785
I've got it!

01:58:46.787 --> 01:58:48.496
I've found it!

01:58:56.838 --> 01:58:59.006
And once it came,
there were many plans

01:58:59.090 --> 01:59:00.966
I had to make in secret.

01:59:01.051 --> 01:59:03.177
I could trust no one else.

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:07.890
I had long suspected that the Therns
were following my movements.

01:59:14.564 --> 01:59:16.565
Sir.

01:59:16.691 --> 01:59:18.901
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.

01:59:19.903 --> 01:59:23.072
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.241
And, Thompson...

01:59:26.243 --> 01:59:28.202
My attorney as well.

01:59:29.955 --> 01:59:31.580
Of course, sir.

01:59:37.587 --> 01:59:40.589
Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.

01:59:46.429 --> 01:59:49.265
The reason
for my bizarre funeral instructions.

01:59:52.811 --> 01:59:56.480
Why the door can only be opened
from the inside.

01:59:58.233 --> 02:00:03.237
For if my body dies on Earth,
then my copy dies on Mars.

02:00:05.448 --> 02:00:06.699
You are the key.

02:00:06.783 --> 02:00:10.035
This is the task I entrust to you
along with all my fortune.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:13.372
Protect my body.
The Therns will attempt to destroy it.

02:00:13.456 --> 02:00:15.583
In the time it has taken you
to read these pages,

02:00:15.667 --> 02:00:17.751
they may have already done so.

02:00:25.927 --> 02:00:27.928
I am the key. I am the key.

02:00:28.013 --> 02:00:30.139
I, Edgar.

02:00:31.975 --> 02:00:33.976
Ed... Ed...

02:00:34.102 --> 02:00:36.103
E...D...

02:00:36.187 --> 02:00:37.521
Ed!

02:00:37.606 --> 02:00:39.732
It should work!

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:51.785
Dear Ned.

02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:55.831
You sneaky devil!

02:00:55.957 --> 02:00:59.460
You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!

02:01:21.066 --> 02:01:22.358
Hello, Ned.

02:01:27.072 --> 02:01:30.074
Toxin. Derived from the puffer fish.

02:01:30.158 --> 02:01:32.034
Simulates death.

02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:40.000
You never found the medallion.

02:01:40.085 --> 02:01:41.377
No.

02:01:42.712 --> 02:01:45.798
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

02:01:47.384 --> 02:01:50.886
I... I was just bait?

02:01:51.054 --> 02:01:54.390
No. You're far more than that.

02:01:54.724 --> 02:01:56.850
I really do need a protector.

02:01:58.895 --> 02:02:01.063
That is, if you're willing.

02:02:09.781 --> 02:02:11.198
Goodbye, Ned.

02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:17.871
Oh, and, Ned...

02:02:18.915 --> 02:02:20.499
Take up a cause.

02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:22.543
Fall in love.

02:02:22.627 --> 02:02:24.253
Write a book.

02:02:26.256 --> 02:02:28.298
It's time I went home.

02:02:39.436 --> 02:02:46.316
Ock ohem ocktei wies...
