24:04.882 --> 24:06.651
Bitch is crazy.

24:06.686 --> 24:09.687
-Shut the fuck up, Tre.
-No, he's right.

24:10.189 --> 24:12.591
Bitch is all kinds of crazy.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.726
Now give me your
fucking wallets, both of you.

24:20.194 --> 24:21.732
Now fuck off.

24:54.998 --> 24:56.162
Hey.

24:59.134 --> 25:00.573
Do you remember me?

25:03.644 --> 25:04.808
Yeah.

25:07.344 --> 25:09.648
Where-- Where's my...

25:14.952 --> 25:16.820
You want to shower?

25:18.153 --> 25:20.021
No, I'm good.

25:20.423 --> 25:23.728
That's my polite way
of saying you stink.

26:07.103 --> 26:08.707
What's your name, soldier?

26:14.374 --> 26:15.846
Holloway.

26:17.949 --> 26:19.179
Connor Holloway.

26:24.153 --> 26:27.154
I hope you like frozen lasagna,
Connor Holloway.

26:31.765 --> 26:32.830
Yes, ma'am.

26:34.735 --> 26:35.965
I'm Mary.

26:41.038 --> 26:42.103
Mary.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.744
I'm Connor.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.044
I know.

26:49.079 --> 26:50.309
You said that already.

26:53.853 --> 26:55.413
My old man was army.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.658
Fought in
the first Desert Storm.

27:13.268 --> 27:16.038
You crazy ass piece of shit.

28:01.822 --> 28:02.887
What do you want?

28:04.286 --> 28:05.351
What do I want?

28:05.986 --> 28:07.925
I want to eat.
What do you want?

28:10.556 --> 28:11.830
I want to know...

28:13.460 --> 28:14.734
why are you doing this?

28:18.003 --> 28:19.266
I don't have any money.

28:20.071 --> 28:21.433
Oh, actually...

28:27.144 --> 28:29.243
those two idiots
donated to your cause.

28:36.483 --> 28:37.823
You mugged those kids.

28:40.454 --> 28:42.927
This spirit sort of moved me.

28:44.898 --> 28:46.799
I don't have any drugs.

28:47.395 --> 28:49.065
Okay.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.330
Whatever the fuck you're
hoping to get out of this,

28:50.365 --> 28:52.299
I don't-- I don't have it.

28:52.334 --> 28:53.773
Okay? I got nothing.

28:55.403 --> 28:56.776
You got an appetite?

29:00.177 --> 29:01.979
Just eat, dummy.

29:23.134 --> 29:24.463
It's hot.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.235
I'm sorry.

29:28.304 --> 29:29.369
It's okay.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.214

<i>Beauty and the Beast?</i>

Not funny, I guess.

30:26.395 --> 30:28.065
Boyfriend/girlfriend?

30:30.971 --> 30:32.102
Did you fuck her?

30:34.205 --> 30:35.270
Sometimes.

31:02.970 --> 31:04.035
It's my fault.

31:10.142 --> 31:11.207
How?

31:15.444 --> 31:17.543
<i> Yeah, right.</i>

31:17.578 --> 31:20.051
-Whoo!
-Sweetheart.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.086
-So good.
-Oh, yeah.

31:22.121 --> 31:24.550
Dennis, you know
how to tickle. Yes!

31:24.585 --> 31:27.223
That's a pretty ass.
So good.

31:28.655 --> 31:30.622
So hot!

31:32.263 --> 31:34.032
Let's get Scotty a little, man.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.334
Oh, he is yours, okay?

31:39.369 --> 31:41.699
-No...
-There you go. Come on.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.042
-Get there.

31:44.077 --> 31:47.210
Yes, Scotty! Whoo!

31:49.676 --> 31:51.214
Yeah!

31:51.249 --> 31:53.084
Scotty!

31:53.119 --> 31:55.581
-Let's go, Scotty boy.

31:55.616 --> 31:58.749
All right, Scotty. Whoo!

31:58.784 --> 32:01.323
Yeah, get that, girl. Yeah!

32:14.536 --> 32:16.437
So if you had been
paying attention...

32:18.606 --> 32:20.507
Doing the one thing

32:20.542 --> 32:22.311
you're supposed
to be doing, she...

32:29.749 --> 32:31.188
Say something.

32:35.590 --> 32:37.095
Say something!

32:43.136 --> 32:44.267
Like what?

32:46.700 --> 32:48.304
Like you're sorry.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.506
I'm sorry.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.215
I don't forgive you.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.745
I don't.

33:52.568 --> 33:53.633
Jesus.

33:55.340 --> 33:56.570
You're burning up.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.310
Can I see?

34:14.491 --> 34:16.161
Paper towels and duct tape?

34:22.631 --> 34:25.830
Listen,
if you're not full of shit...

34:28.274 --> 34:30.340
and you really intend to
draw a line through

34:30.375 --> 34:32.540
every name on that list,
you're going to need help.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.480
So, help me.

34:40.682 --> 34:42.286
I mean, like, medical help.

34:46.853 --> 34:48.754
I got a good few years left.

34:50.428 --> 34:51.658
Yeah. And then what?

34:59.833 --> 35:00.898
Then it's done.

35:35.803 --> 35:37.374
That's him?

35:37.709 --> 35:39.508
That's one of them, yeah.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.412
And you want me
to go talk to him?

35:44.383 --> 35:46.944
This man, you say
helped to murder my sister?

35:47.813 --> 35:50.585
Just for a second.
Get him into the car.

35:52.655 --> 35:53.951
How exactly?

35:53.986 --> 35:55.689
Sorry to bother you.

35:55.724 --> 35:57.691
<i> Tell him</i>
<i>you're having car trouble car.</i>

35:57.726 --> 35:59.957
-My car just stopped working.
-<i> That the car won't start.</i>

35:59.992 --> 36:02.333
<i> That's the stupidest</i>
<i>thing I've ever heard.</i>

36:02.368 --> 36:04.269
Um, I don't know.

36:04.304 --> 36:05.666
<i> Just smile and stick</i>
<i>your tits out, all right?</i>

36:05.701 --> 36:06.964
Like, a starter, I think?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.801
<i>And pop the fucking trunk.</i>

36:09.606 --> 36:11.243
Do you live around here?

36:11.545 --> 36:13.542
No. No, I just--

36:13.911 --> 36:16.743
-Why? Do I look familiar?
-Yeah. You know,

36:17.178 --> 36:19.284
who actually
might be able to help?

36:19.748 --> 36:21.385
My wife.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.354
You know, maybe we can just--
I'll go grab her.

36:23.389 --> 36:26.225
No, don't. Don't--
Don't bother her.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.590
-Not bother? I mean, I just--

36:30.429 --> 36:31.824
Hey.

36:31.859 --> 36:33.727
-Can I help you?
-Hey, how's it going?

37:26.683 --> 37:27.880
This is the guy.

37:28.148 --> 37:29.519
This is what guy?

37:31.919 --> 37:33.490
<i> He was there.</i>

37:33.525 --> 37:35.756
<i>Like, him and three others.</i>

37:37.727 --> 37:39.595
This is the guy
who hit me in the head.

37:40.829 --> 37:42.301
And this guy, he...

37:46.802 --> 37:48.439
Why are you
looking at me like that?

37:48.774 --> 37:50.067
I thought
you couldn't remember.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.544
It's coming back.

37:55.976 --> 37:57.712
Oh, boy. Listen.

37:58.381 --> 38:00.451
I've been working my ass off
to keep your sentence

38:00.486 --> 38:02.112
as short as possible, okay?

38:02.147 --> 38:05.456
It's been a lot of back
and forth, a lot of bartering,

38:05.491 --> 38:07.953
trading on your service record
for some leniency.

38:07.988 --> 38:10.494
We finally gotten
the DA to agree

38:10.529 --> 38:11.759
to what I consider to be

38:11.794 --> 38:13.893
very reasonable terms.

38:13.928 --> 38:15.928
Now, you want to throw this
into the mix, huh?

38:15.963 --> 38:17.765
Dennis McNab?

38:17.800 --> 38:20.031
He's kind of a big deal
in this city, right?

38:20.500 --> 38:23.903
It ain't like he's some kind
of scrub hiring strippers.

38:25.445 --> 38:27.346
You get all kinds, trust me.

38:35.488 --> 38:37.950
Okay, but you keep pushing,

38:37.985 --> 38:41.954
and I guarantee the DA's
going to push right back

38:41.989 --> 38:45.397
and in the end, we're talking
about a junkie whore.

38:45.432 --> 38:48.026
All due respect,
but that's what it is.

38:48.061 --> 38:49.764
It would have been nice

38:49.799 --> 38:51.898
if you would have told me
about the heroin. You see?

38:53.605 --> 38:55.033
You see what I'm saying here?

38:55.068 --> 38:57.442
It's things like that
that compromise our case,

38:57.477 --> 38:59.477
and it compromises
your credibility.

39:15.154 --> 39:17.726
But I'd rather not get stuck
talking to the--

39:17.761 --> 39:20.091
Shoot! Did you grab his binkie
from the nursery?

39:20.126 --> 39:22.995

the nursery. Honey, you did.

47:37.491 --> 47:39.491
You're not going anywhere.
Look at you.

47:40.329 --> 47:41.394
You--

47:42.067 --> 47:43.132
You're done.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.634
Connor. Connor. Jesus.
Stop the car.

48:26.639 --> 48:28.177
It's okay. I'm okay.

48:28.779 --> 48:31.279
You're not okay.
Connor! Connor!

48:31.314 --> 48:33.710
Shit. Connor, wake up.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.647
Oh, God! Stop. Connor.

48:36.682 --> 48:38.957
Connor. Connor.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.534
Oh, God!

49:39.613 --> 49:41.382
Where are we going?

49:42.418 --> 49:43.483
The motel.

49:44.152 --> 49:46.090
If we can make it that far.

49:47.654 --> 49:48.785
I'll make it.

50:01.701 --> 50:05.043
♪

50:35.504 --> 50:36.767
Hold on, Connor.

50:49.782 --> 50:52.189
Oh, my God. Okay.

50:53.885 --> 50:55.621
Uh.

50:57.460 --> 50:59.130
-Here.

50:59.165 --> 51:01.330
-Take these.
-How-- How many?

51:01.365 --> 51:03.596
-How many?
-It doesn't matter.

51:05.171 --> 51:07.138
With the Mylanta.

51:09.835 --> 51:11.373
Drink this.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.145
All of it.

51:29.855 --> 51:31.294
Okay.

51:31.496 --> 51:32.790
Connor.

51:33.125 --> 51:35.463
This is going to suck.

51:35.498 --> 51:36.563
Okay?

51:44.441 --> 51:46.243
Try to think of something else.

51:47.873 --> 51:49.543
Ow!

51:49.908 --> 51:51.545
Sorry.

51:51.747 --> 51:53.712
Here, I'll kiss it better.

52:08.861 --> 52:12.632
Oh, we can move to Portland.

52:14.702 --> 52:17.604
-And do what?
-Same shit we're doing here.

52:19.707 --> 52:22.444
And everything's cool
in Portland.

52:23.876 --> 52:26.415
Literally, it's never hot.

52:27.682 --> 52:29.385
It's just cold.

52:30.916 --> 52:33.389
Like, cool, man.

52:34.755 --> 52:37.360
Get it?
That's called a homonym.

52:38.825 --> 52:40.198
Cool and cool.

52:42.433 --> 52:44.202
You ever think about
doing anything else?

52:46.998 --> 52:49.339
No. I mean, I don't know.

52:50.001 --> 52:51.671
Maybe when I was a kid.

52:52.938 --> 52:54.344
You know?

52:55.974 --> 53:00.218
I wanted to grow up and
be an astronaut or something.

53:03.553 --> 53:04.618
But no.

53:06.655 --> 53:07.819
I like this gig.

53:08.087 --> 53:09.425
You know, I--

53:10.725 --> 53:13.627
I want to work, I work.
I don't. I don't.

53:14.762 --> 53:16.465
How many people can say that?

53:17.996 --> 53:20.700
Plus, I-- I get to spend
my days with you.

53:33.418 --> 53:34.483
Does it bother you?

53:42.625 --> 53:43.690
What if it did?

53:46.090 --> 53:47.364
Would you stop?

53:54.505 --> 53:55.702
No.

53:56.672 --> 53:57.968
I don't know.

53:59.576 --> 54:00.806
Maybe.

54:00.841 --> 54:04.579
Yeah,
and do what? Hmm?

54:04.614 --> 54:08.352
Hey, I can do things.
I got skills.

54:08.387 --> 54:11.322
Oh, yeah? What skills? Hmm?

54:41.387 --> 54:42.848
Boo!

54:42.883 --> 54:44.685
Are you booing me?

54:46.084 --> 54:47.358
Boo!

54:48.823 --> 54:50.086
What tricks can you do?

54:51.628 --> 54:53.958
None.
I didn't go to clown college.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.060
Boo!

55:31.767 --> 55:34.636
Really, you're going to tie
a cherry stem in a knot?

55:36.640 --> 55:39.377
Oh, come on, son. Boo!

55:43.075 --> 55:44.140
Ta-da.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.714
What's the trick?

55:47.516 --> 55:49.717
Well, it's gone.
All right, I swallowed it.

55:50.753 --> 55:52.049
Ta-da!

55:52.084 --> 55:54.524
-That's not a trick.
-Sure it is.

55:54.559 --> 55:56.856
It's not going to hurt
my gut at all.

55:57.225 --> 55:58.957
I got a stomach like a goat.

56:05.471 --> 56:07.097
That's all I got.

56:09.035 --> 56:10.133
You got more than that.

56:16.581 --> 56:17.943
And he's back.

56:20.013 --> 56:21.078
How long was I out for?

56:21.680 --> 56:24.081
Not long. Just a few minutes.

56:28.791 --> 56:29.823
We better go.

56:30.358 --> 56:32.958
We will but give yourself
a second, all right?

56:33.460 --> 56:36.093
If you're gonna pass out again,
I'd rather have you do it here

56:36.128 --> 56:37.600
than in the car.

56:51.814 --> 56:53.550
Sorry, I killed you.

56:55.884 --> 56:56.949
It's okay.

56:58.117 --> 56:59.457
It wasn't your fault.

57:00.526 --> 57:04.220
Oh, really? You're going to
choose now to be nice to me?

57:04.255 --> 57:05.529
Fuck off.

57:07.764 --> 57:08.829
What, um--

57:11.031 --> 57:12.096
What do you do,

57:12.531 --> 57:13.801
you know, in real life?

57:14.804 --> 57:16.034
I'm an archivist.

57:17.169 --> 57:18.234
An anarchist?

57:19.171 --> 57:20.236
What's that?

57:20.471 --> 57:22.106
An archivist.

57:23.747 --> 57:24.812
What's the difference?

57:25.815 --> 57:29.652
Well, um, everything.

57:29.687 --> 57:31.555
I mean, they're not even--

57:31.957 --> 57:34.151
Do you really want to know
or you're just fucking with me?

57:34.853 --> 57:37.154
Oh, no, I'm--
I'm dying, to know.

57:40.665 --> 57:42.093
Um.

57:42.128 --> 57:45.228
Well, as an archivist,
it's my job

57:45.263 --> 57:50.002
to pack up and organize
collections of work that are

57:50.037 --> 57:51.234
considered to be,

57:52.003 --> 57:55.205
you know, of some significance,
like important books,

57:55.240 --> 57:57.174
films, stuff like that.

57:57.509 --> 58:01.651
So we can be sure to still
have them in the future.

58:01.686 --> 58:03.048
Why wouldn't we have that?

58:05.052 --> 58:06.920
Well, I'm not sure
if you've noticed,

58:06.955 --> 58:09.560
but books are sort of going
the way of the dodo bird so...

58:10.222 --> 58:11.562
The dodo bird.

58:12.364 --> 58:14.928
Yeah, you know,
the dodo bird went extinct.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.700
It sounds nice.

58:18.769 --> 58:19.900
To be an archivist?

58:21.068 --> 58:22.298
To be extinct.

58:31.716 --> 58:32.781
You know,

58:35.247 --> 58:36.785
Mary and I--

58:40.351 --> 58:43.286
Mary and I, we weren't close.

58:44.993 --> 58:47.191
Yeah, I guess you
probably knew that.

58:50.768 --> 58:52.735
You know, I honestly
can't even remember

58:52.770 --> 58:54.066
the last time we talked.

58:57.335 --> 58:58.807
I know she called me, though.

59:00.976 --> 59:02.910
A couple months
before she died.

59:05.244 --> 59:07.882
But I let it go to voicemail,
she didn't leave me a message.

59:12.416 --> 59:14.317
For 13 years, I blamed you

59:14.352 --> 59:17.353
for taking away my chance to
talk to her just one more time.

59:20.127 --> 59:21.324
To tell her--

59:25.198 --> 59:26.967
I don't know. Something.

59:28.971 --> 59:30.839
To let her know
that I gave a shit

59:30.874 --> 59:32.874
and she was important.

59:37.012 --> 59:38.374
But then in the warehouse,

59:40.114 --> 59:42.147
the brothers,
they admitted it to me.

59:43.447 --> 59:45.854
Right to my face
and I couldn't do it.

59:46.389 --> 59:47.955
I couldn't pull the trigger.

59:50.454 --> 59:51.827
And I thought,

59:53.226 --> 59:55.028
"What the fuck
is wrong with me?"

59:59.034 --> 1:00:00.396
But then I saw what you did.

1:00:04.336 --> 1:00:05.973
And I don't know what's worse,

1:00:07.306 --> 1:00:09.240
to be like me
or to be like you.

1:00:13.246 --> 1:00:16.214
You can't tell me that this is
what Mary would want for you.

1:00:19.186 --> 1:00:21.153
Well, what difference
does it make?

1:00:22.321 --> 1:00:23.859
What do you mean?

1:00:25.489 --> 1:00:26.763
I mean,

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:28.996
what difference does it make?

1:00:31.330 --> 1:00:32.703
People like me--

1:00:35.004 --> 1:00:36.102
We don't get to win.

1:00:38.337 --> 1:00:39.677
No, I--

1:00:40.346 --> 1:00:42.141
I'm sorry,
but I call it bullshit.

1:00:42.176 --> 1:00:44.242
You could have made
different choices.

1:00:44.277 --> 1:00:45.848
Okay.

1:00:45.883 --> 1:00:47.311
Fuck you.

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.412
Have an opinion.

1:00:52.087 --> 1:00:53.790
Do you know who my father was?

1:00:55.024 --> 1:00:57.255
A man named Leroy Denton.

1:00:59.226 --> 1:01:00.962
My biological father...

1:01:02.064 --> 1:01:03.360
was a serial rapist.

1:01:03.895 --> 1:01:07.067
There are a bunch of women
in the late sixties,

1:01:07.803 --> 1:01:09.465
the ones who didn't
get abortions,

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:13.106
they gave birth
to things like me.

1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:17.748
Someone walked in on
my mom screaming,

1:01:17.783 --> 1:01:19.310
thinking of flushing me
down the toilet.

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:23.754
They saved my life.

1:01:26.088 --> 1:01:28.418
Gave me to the state.
A fucked up kid.

1:01:29.795 --> 1:01:31.960
Raised in fucked up places.

1:01:33.029 --> 1:01:34.457
And you talk about choices.

1:01:38.331 --> 1:01:39.737
