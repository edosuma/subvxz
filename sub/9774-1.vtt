Look, of course I was gonna tell you, okay?

40:07.640 --> 40:09.563
But you know there's
confidentiality agreements.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.529
Look, a deal's a deal, Pete, okay?
Let me tell you something.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.082
PolyGram is a big, big company.

40:15.160 --> 40:20.007
Don't you "Pete" me,
you hairy fucking bridge troll.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.323
My father lost a leg to those Nazi bastards.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.603
My gran has got
a piece of shrapnel stuck in her ass

40:26.680 --> 40:28.921
from a Nazi fucking buzz bomb.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.604
So there's no scenario on this bloody Earth

40:32.680 --> 40:36.890
where my band,
a proud John Bull fucking British band,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.367
is gonna be sold out to
a bunch of goose-stepping,

40:39.440 --> 40:41.408
bloodthirsty fucking Huns.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.525
Two of them were Dutch.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.090
Fucking Dutch!

40:47.160 --> 40:48.446
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

40:48.520 --> 40:50.568
The fucking lowland cunts.

40:55.240 --> 40:59.245
Just bought those bagels. They were fresh.
Not so fresh anymore.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.727
Eight hours ago, I talked to you on the phone.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.131
I told you to handle the Zeppelin situation.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.409
Now, not only do you not handle it,

41:12.720 --> 41:17.806
but you tell their fucking manager
about the deal with the fucking Germans?

41:17.880 --> 41:20.281
It just slipped out. You saw that guy.
He's intimidating.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.010
Intimidating? You want "intimidating"?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.004
I'm gonna fucking hang you
out the fucking window.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.570
(CLAMORING)

41:28.200 --> 41:29.406
- Too late.
- Hey, cut it out!

41:29.480 --> 41:32.006
- It's too late, Richie. It's too late.
- All right, all right, all right.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.287
It's too late. They fucked us. We got fucked.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.283
Ahmet offered Zeppelin their own label.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.721
- What?
- Yeah.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.690
Yeah, you believe that shit?
He had it in the fucking deal.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.048
He screwed us. He used us.
He used us for leverage.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.171
PolyGram is gonna be here on Thursday.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.686
Yeah, we're totally fucking fucked.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.807
Fuck!

41:55.720 --> 41:57.484
I'm not telling him.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.330
There's more.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.241
Uh...

42:03.320 --> 42:04.845
Buck Rogers, Ellerbee Broadcasting.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.485
ANNOUNCER: <i>R: For his distinguished service
to the radio community.</i>

42:08.960 --> 42:11.201
- The radio guy. I know you do.
- RICHIE: I know who the fuck he is.

42:11.960 --> 42:17.808
Yeah, well, apparently Donny Osmond
stiffed him on some promotion thing.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.845
He's threatening not to play the new album.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.565
Fine, I guess I'll go talk to him.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.885
He's talking a boycott, label-wide.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.928
Over Donny fucking Osmond?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.810
ZAK: He's a fucking maniac!
You know that guy.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.041
(BOTH SIGH)

42:37.120 --> 42:40.203
He thinks we favor his competitors now,
and...

42:41.520 --> 42:43.010
Look, I want to bring in Joe Corso.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.330
Corso's a thug.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.965
You don't know that.

42:48.040 --> 42:52.125
You don't know that. He's good.
He's good at what he does.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.931
You shouldn't say things
about people that you don't know.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.083
You know... (STAMMERING)
He's the best promotion man in the business.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.681
Fourteen radio stations
across every major market

43:01.760 --> 43:04.366
not willing to play any of our albums.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.689
It'll spread like a fucking leukemia.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.881
It's no joke, Richie.
We're gonna be bankrupt in a month.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.365
Fine, bring in Corso.

43:22.440 --> 43:26.729
Meantime, PolyGram is watching us,
so buy us some charts.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.046
Paper ads on Cash Box.
A single on Billboard's top 20 if you can.

43:31.120 --> 43:35.648
And you, I don't care if you've got to ship
crates of Captain Beefheart's catalog

43:35.720 --> 43:37.449
to an empty fucking warehouse
in Poughkeepsie,

43:37.520 --> 43:39.443
inflate the fuck out of the sales numbers.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.488
Meanwhile, I'll go lean on fucking A&R.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.801
- What about me?
- You?

43:43.880 --> 43:45.644
You go to the emergency room.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.290
Oh, my God. For what?

43:47.360 --> 43:49.089
See if they can get your head
out of your fucking ass.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.889
No, yeah, that's a good plan.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.003
Some of these are okay still.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.481
Let's pick these up,
give them to the assistants.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.528
The sesames landed face-up.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.046
JULIE: Who knew Vikings could sing?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.810
These are the original white people, folks.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.245
Hey, is this Swedish?

44:05.320 --> 44:07.243
Look at you, little Miss Woman of the World.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.402
Yeah, whoever knew you went
north of Queens Boulevard, right?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.482
Oh, we can't all be jet-setters.
Who had the turkey provolone?

44:11.760 --> 44:14.650
Oh, Clark, how was that trip to
the Norwegian sex change clinic you went to?

44:14.720 --> 44:17.087
- Pow! Right in the kisser.
- Wow, okay.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.446
The roast beef is mine.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.284
Let me get some of the Thai stick
you're holding, all right?

44:20.360 --> 44:23.489
Fucking barkeep at Small's shooting
me down Wallbangers all fucking night.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.642
Oh, good. Marvin has a hangover.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.041
Least I know one of you has been doing
your homework on a school night.

44:28.120 --> 44:30.851
- Hey, Rich.
- I left that Aerosmith bootleg with Cece.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.681
What is this?

44:33.760 --> 44:36.969
I think it's a Swedish girl group.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.326
They just charted in Europe.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.882
We passed on 'em months ago.
Atlantic UK just signed them.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.007
Abba.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.043
Music's garbage, but I'd fuck the blonde.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.561
Would the blonde fuck you?
That's what we want to know.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.369
Can you beg in Swedish?

44:49.440 --> 44:50.885
<i>Oui,</i> oui... ls that...

44:51.000 --> 44:52.331
CLARK: What was Atlantic thinking?
This is crazy.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.129
JAMIE: I know. But it's catchy, right?
You can dance to it.

44:54.200 --> 44:57.966
Hey, uh, don't you have letters to type?
Just saying.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.969
MARVIN: This is
Alvin and the Chipmunks, baby.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.726
Please make this shit stop, man.
I'm throbbing right now.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.882
- You don't like Alvin and the Chipmunks?
-(MUSIC STOPS)

45:09.480 --> 45:11.881
You're all hearing this the same way?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.001
Yeah.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.007
No.

45:17.560 --> 45:18.891
Of course.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.371
Three bars.

45:24.640 --> 45:28.361
Three bars, I can tell
they'll be filling football stadiums.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.090
JULIE: Come on, Richie. (CHUCKLING)

45:30.160 --> 45:32.481
Where are we with the Good Rats?

45:34.160 --> 45:35.321
Hmm?

45:41.360 --> 45:43.806
-(CLEARING THROAT)
- Eventually you're gonna have to swallow.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.565
And when you do,
I want to hear some good news.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.126
Okay. They... (COUGHING)

45:49.800 --> 45:52.770
They went with Warners.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.730
And you're here eating lunch?

45:55.240 --> 45:56.480
He needs sustenance, doesn't he?

45:56.560 --> 45:59.564
What he needs is to sign the next Good Rats
like I'm fucking paying him to.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.324
You're completely right. I will go. I will...

46:01.400 --> 46:03.209
Sit down.
Eat your fucking liverwurst or whatever it is.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.651
Anybody?

46:06.080 --> 46:07.366
Anything?

46:09.600 --> 46:11.204
Come on, people!

46:11.800 --> 46:16.044
Our goddamn roster is like a Chinese menu.
It's all over the fucking place.

46:16.120 --> 46:21.763
Grand Funk and Donny Osmond,
Savoy Brown, fucking Robert Goulet.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.442
Who's next, huh? The Topo Gigio?

46:24.680 --> 46:25.727
Is he in play?

46:27.520 --> 46:29.204
The guy who does the voice, I mean.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.324
Look, Richie, I've been
going all around the city.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.448
- There's nothing good out there.
- Then get out of the city.

46:34.720 --> 46:37.803
You know, Ahmet Ertegun walked through
a fucking swamp to sign...

46:37.880 --> 46:41.043
Professor Longhair, yeah,
we all know that story.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.169
You're a wise-ass now?

46:44.280 --> 46:46.965
No, no, no. Just, I hear you, man.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.485
- Oh! Oh, you hear me?
- Yeah.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.961
You hear me? Because I hear nothing.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.881
You know what they call this label
out there in the world?

46:56.720 --> 46:58.643
American Cemetery.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.928
Where artists go to die.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.846
You know, maybe we could get hipper offices.
Move out of the Brill Building.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.888
I like it here, asshole.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.121
Bars,

47:12.760 --> 47:14.125
dance clubs,

47:14.400 --> 47:16.687
fucking high school talent shows.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.569
Wherever people sing.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.568
Public restrooms, boss.
That's honestly the place I've been lately.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.847
Groups go in there
to rehearse for the harmonies.

47:25.920 --> 47:26.967
- There you go.
- They go in there

47:27.040 --> 47:28.849
-and they're singing all the time.
- JULIE: Nine months.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.725
Nine months,

47:33.040 --> 47:35.850
I sat in the dark to sign José Feliciano.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.688
Okay? He's blind. He doesn't need lamps.

47:38.760 --> 47:40.489
I want what's next!

47:53.960 --> 47:57.328
Richie, I have something. The Nasty Bits.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.801
I mean, they're raw,
but I think they're pretty good.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.850
Nasty Bits.
Richie, it's four chimps with Telecasters.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.445
You lost speaking privileges.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.881
They're playing the Coventry tonight.
I'm gonna go check them out.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.889
Where'd you find them?

48:12.760 --> 48:15.809
I saw the singer on the subway
and I liked his look.

48:26.760 --> 48:29.001
That's what I'm talking about.

48:30.880 --> 48:33.486
From the fucking sandwich girl.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.648
- Gold star for Jamie.
- That's right.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.165
That's right, skinny. You know what?

48:39.240 --> 48:42.562
Since you're such a fucking stud,
you can get on a plane right now,

48:42.640 --> 48:45.689
go to LA, coach,
and deliver a check to David Geffen.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.604
I was supposed to cover the session
with England Dan & John Ford Coley.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.968
No,no,no.
You were supposed to sign the Good Rats.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.690
I don't have a fucking thing to add to that.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.369
Hey, thanks for the sandwich.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.771
Of course.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.124
(SINGING) Mama

49:08.200 --> 49:11.283
<i>He treats your daughter mean</i>

49:14.000 --> 49:15.923
Mama

49:16.000 --> 49:18.844
<i>He treats your daughter mean</i>

49:21.960 --> 49:23.928
Mama

49:24.000 --> 49:26.207
<i>He treats your daughter mean</i>

49:29.080 --> 49:32.482
<i>He's the meanest man</i>

49:32.560 --> 49:34.608
I've ever seen

49:36.400 --> 49:39.370
<i>Mama, he treats me badly</i>

49:40.240 --> 49:43.244
<i>Makes me love him madly</i>

49:44.240 --> 49:47.050
<i>Mama, he takes my money</i>

49:47.920 --> 49:50.082
<i>Makes me call him honey...</i>

49:52.600 --> 49:55.809
I love the blues. I love it. Don't get me wrong.

49:56.440 --> 49:57.805
I love it.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.806
But does it sell? You understand?

50:00.880 --> 50:05.124
Frankie Lymon, Hank Ballard,
Chubby Checker, Jackie Wilson.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.850
That's what I'm talking about.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.843
Kiddie music. (CHUCKLES)

50:09.600 --> 50:12.171
Who do you think buys the records, huh?

50:12.240 --> 50:14.811
- Stravinsky fans?
- Hey, listen to me.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.962
You would sing the hell out of that stuff.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.009
But that ain't who I am, man.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.202
That's right. You're Little Jimmy Little, baby.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.204
- Who?
- Little...

50:25.000 --> 50:27.651
You didn't tell him? I told you.
It was your idea. Tell him.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.688
You cut a few records under a different name.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.004
You chart a few hits, right?
Then you start recording the real stuff.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.486
What, you'd let me sing the blues?

50:36.560 --> 50:40.042
You give me hits,
you can sing fucking Mary Had a <i>Little Lamb.</i>

50:40.120 --> 50:44.091
You can sing fucking opera.
I don't give a fuck what you sing. I want hits.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.650
(LAUGHING)

50:46.280 --> 50:50.285
This is great and everything,
but I don't know what to say.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.289
You like playing dives?

50:52.800 --> 50:54.529
Do you, hmm?

50:56.000 --> 50:59.243
You like having a little shitty pisshole toilet
for a dressing room

50:59.320 --> 51:01.004
for the rest of your life?

51:02.560 --> 51:04.085
I'm offering you a record contract.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.283
You're offering Jimmy Little a record contract.

51:07.360 --> 51:08.486
Uh, uh...

51:09.840 --> 51:11.649
Little Jimmy Little.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.605
You know, 'cause you're tall. You're big.

51:16.320 --> 51:21.929
You see? It's terrific.
Five hundred cash, three points I'm offer...

51:23.120 --> 51:25.851
You know, let me talk to your manager
for a second, please.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.081
- Two seconds.
- Thank you.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.371
Huh?

51:35.120 --> 51:37.441
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I'm good.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.764
Are you retarded?

51:44.320 --> 51:45.526
What?

51:46.480 --> 51:48.608
Are you? Are you mentally fucking retarded?

51:48.680 --> 51:50.170
- Are you?
- No.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.931
Get this guy in line.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.051
He wants to sing blues.

51:54.120 --> 51:56.088

Private dinner for three dozen
of my top Midwest advertisers

55:00.200 --> 55:03.010

- The singer?
- He's cute.

Anyway, the big night comes,
me, I do things the right way.

55:16.840 --> 55:21.562
I close down Bistro Romano,
Philly's best restaurant.

All the advertisers are there, they're excited.

He didn't fucking do it to you.

All right, all right.
So an hour goes by. Then two.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.766

in the hospital.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.048
In the fucking hospital.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.330
Not for nothing,
but he does have pretty bad asthma.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.731
What's that?

56:09.800 --> 56:12.406
Asthma. They all do. All the Osmonds.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.048
I look like an asshole to you?

56:24.080 --> 56:25.605
No, seriously.

56:28.560 --> 56:32.531
I mean, I've been called an asshole
a thousand times in my life.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.206
You've probably called it
to me behind my back.

56:35.280 --> 56:37.362
As a matter of fact, Richie,

56:37.600 --> 56:39.364
I know I'm an asshole.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.329
That's not my question.

56:43.680 --> 56:44.806
I want to know...

56:47.000 --> 56:48.684
When you look at me,

56:50.880 --> 56:55.249
in any, like, way, shape or form,

56:55.320 --> 56:59.120
on some level, does my face

56:59.920 --> 57:02.685

I'm thinking.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.205
(CHUCKLING)

57:17.920 --> 57:20.685
What a fucking ridiculous question.
Of course not.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.407
No.

57:22.480 --> 57:26.087
So why the fuck
would you tell me asthma, okay,

57:26.160 --> 57:28.766
when the next day in the papers,

57:28.880 --> 57:30.609
on television,

57:30.680 --> 57:34.526
this scumbag, this cocksucker in his heart,

57:34.600 --> 57:37.001
is at some county fucking fair

with fucking cows in the background

57:41.600 --> 57:43.364

57:43.480 --> 57:46.404

57:46.480 --> 57:48.164
And he's all happy, right?

57:48.240 --> 57:50.163
And I'm left looking like a jerk-off.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.166

57:52.280 --> 57:53.770
You of all fucking people,

57:53.840 --> 57:56.002
you know how unreliable these musicians are.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.401
They're cockheads.
But I tell you what, Richie, he's right.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.891
That prick should have came up here,

57:59.960 --> 58:02.531
signed an autograph for his daughter,
these other little kids there.

58:02.600 --> 58:03.681
This is bullshit.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.161
- You're right, Buck.
- The bigger they are, the worse it gets.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.287
BUCK: "Bigger they are"?

58:08.080 --> 58:10.208
Let me explain something, my friend.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.248
There's always somebody bigger,

58:12.320 --> 58:14.322
and that's the moneyman.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.890
That's you, right, Daddy?

58:15.960 --> 58:18.486
Huh, you better fucking believe that.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.803

how can we put this fucking thing behind us?

58:32.920 --> 58:34.445

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.530
It'll all be gone.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.725
You know, like it never existed.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.121
Twenty years, just gone.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.771

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.604
This is nothing?

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.329
Who's saying you have to retire
and build model trains?

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.925
Take the PolyGram job.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.128
You really think that's me?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.965
I don't know.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.527
I'm trying to help you, babe.
I just don't know what you want.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.444
I need a change.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.323
I need a change, too.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.526

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.360

- Yeah.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.089
Exactly, I bet the entire 20 grand.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.249
This nag does it, that's it,
I'm up a half a million bucks.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.564
Cocksucker's still running.

It's still running. (LAUGHING)

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.129
Still waiting to hear how this is my problem.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.402
No, no, it's not your problem. It's my problem.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.842
It's nobody's problem.
I'm just saying, you know?

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.567
- Set?
- Lester, you ready?

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.760
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.043
Little Jimmy Little, The Cha Cha Twist.
Take one.

(CHUCKLES) She loves it.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.688
Her mom looked like that when I first met her.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.210
<i>Ooh...</i>

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.086

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.642
<i>The people was yelling out for more</i>

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.291
<i>And all they was saying was go, man, go</i>

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:06.208
<i>- Come on

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.523
<i>- The name of the place, I like it like that
- I like it like that</i>

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.088
Fiscally speaking, 1972.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.321
American Century claimed
$6 million in profits,

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:21.529
yet 92% of the records you released were,
speaking frankly,

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.166
flops.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.968
Technically, yes.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:31.126
But in reality, they only look like flops.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.804
Oh, please, explain.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.643
Our artists aren't tuxedo-clad maestros
with degrees in music theory.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.444
We got credibility in the business.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.091
No Leonard Bernsteins.
No Herbert von Karajans.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.924
We're talking about pop singers here.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.689
You like the tea?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.680
<i>Generally speaking,
not your most sophisticated individuals.</i>

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.604
On one side, you've got us, the record execs.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.121
On the other side are the artists' lawyers

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.964
<i>who all want to be record execs,</i>

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.804
<i>so they don't want to piss us off too much</i>

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.370
<i>by being too good at their job.</i>

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.441
No offense.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.008
Next, you have the contract itself.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.966
Now, assume an artist gets paid a dollar
for every record sold,

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.162
less recoupable expenses.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.683
So, sell a million records,
that's a million bucks.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.410
Not bad, right?

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.127
But there's that word...

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.001
"Recoupable."

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.082
First gold record. First gold record.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.004
<i>That means that no matter
how many records they sell,</i>

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.447
<i>the actual cost of producing that record</i>

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.569
always comes out of the artist's end.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.768
Physically manufacturing the record,

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.004
touring costs, studio space,
marketing, packaging.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.609
If a drummer drinks a Pepsi
in the middle of recording that album,

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.002
believe me, he's paying for it
at a 700% markup.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.488
We really don't have any downside.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.451
No, no, we practically
break even on all the flops.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.683
But the hits, that's where we cash in big.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.606
But your biggest hit maker would have been
the Led Zeppelins, no?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.840
RICHIE: Maybe.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.766
Maybe.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.288
But I got to tell you,

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.041
I can't do business with them.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.009
Their manager, Peter Grant.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.209
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this,

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.569
but he hates Germans.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.970
I mean, the man is a serious racist.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.327
It's true. I've never seen anything like it.
I mean...

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.606
ZAK: How awful!

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.170
They almost made my stomach turn.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.050
Horrible. I don't like when we talk
about competitors like this

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.690
because that's not the way we do business.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.161
But let me just say, you're Germans,

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.288
we're Americans, but we're people.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.522
We're people. But this man... This man is...

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.007
- We're all...
- That man is hate. That's all he is.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.243
Right, and no one knows
more about hate than you.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.009
I mean, not you specifically.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.605
You know, just persons like you.

A new discotheque in the city, um...

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.841
Speaking of which, Andy was there

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.127
and he asked for you just the other night.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.924
- He asked for me?
- Mmm.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.331

he had done his eyeliner in black

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.166
Like mine.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.049

"Devilish Devon, I wonder if she's happy."

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.763

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.244
Elvis. Fuck.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.482
This is what I mean with you fucking guys.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.205
Hey, Buck, Joe said you want to talk.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.884
(SNIFFS)

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.166
What?

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.961
Remember?

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.806
You told me to call him to come over here.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.929
You wanted to talk to him.
You forgot already?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.286
(MUTTERING)

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.851
Let's eat. I'm fucking hungry. Come on.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.690
No, you got to fucking stay.
Fucking stay here.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.728
I've been here for two fucking days.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.450
You guys hungry?

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.121
No.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.400
Richie.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.004
Come on, you really took off on me
the other night.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.409
What, I thought we were done.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.962
The night ain't over till the big man says,
it's over, right?

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.690
Well, you know, I had work.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.445
You know, family commitments.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.249
Yeah. Family.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.764
Richie. Richie, come over here.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.964
You got to see this, please.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.883
- Come on, please.
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.645
You ever see this movie?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.605
<i>What, Frankenstein?</i>

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.809
It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.561
But, you know, in life you got to, like...

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.881
You got to face your fears.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.682
You got to face your fears.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.205
Face your fears.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.685
Face your fears.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.009
You face your fears.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.887
Face your fears. Face your fears.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.127
You got to face your fears.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.407
You face your fears.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.889
- You got to face your fears.
- Yeah, no, I got it.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.766
Richie, Richie, what he's trying to say

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.407
is you've got to face your fears.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.448
- That's what he's saying.
- That's it!

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.729
That's what I'm talking...
That's exactly what I mean.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.643
And you hear this song?

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.405
- You hear this song? Frankenstein.
- Right.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.925
That's the name of the song.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.771
It's got the same name as the movie.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.081
You know what they call that?

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.331
synergy-

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.729
- Synergy.
- Right.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:08.960
Motherfuck!

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.284
What the fuck?
Put the fucking gun down, asshole!

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.010
(LAUGHING)

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.004
Oh, fuck. It's fucking hot in here.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.926
Take your shirt off if you're hot.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.923
Buck, what do you want to talk about?

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.961
Come on.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.411
Dance with me.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.845
Yeah, I put the jukebox on random

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.200
because that's what life is.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.884
- Come on, dance.
-I’ve got to go.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.689
- Come on. Where you going?
- I've got to go home, all right.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.046
- Come on, five more minutes.
- I want to go.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.690
I gotta go home to my family.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.006
To your wife?

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.246
You love her, don't you?

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.443
That's how it starts.
You know how I got engaged?

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.611
"Marry me. You're my soul mate."

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.569
You know who my soul mate is now?

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.007
Whoever my dick is in at the time, that's who.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.570
- Okay, I got to go.
- Listen to me.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.406
You want my respect?
You want my business?

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.330
Where's my wife?

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.451
Tell me, Richie. I'm begging you.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.491
Where's my wife?

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.328
She's fucking your brother.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.400
You know,

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.810
your eyes, they're sparkling like the Nile.
You know that?

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.928
Fuck! Motherfucker!

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.765
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Richie, calm down.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.366
- Calm the fuck down.
- He put his fucking hands on me.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.641
Calm down.

What...

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.045
What the fuck did you do?

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.122
What did I fucking do? You hit him first.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.601
Yeah, but I wasn't trying to kill him.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.291
He's dead.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.564
He's fucking dead.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.445
Fuck.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.761
No, no, no, no. He's dead.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.607
He's dead, he's dead,
he's dead, he's fucking dead!

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.204
He's dead. Come with me.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.365
Wait, wait.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.570
We gotta wrap him.
Gotta wrap this fucking guy up.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.005
What do you mean, "wrap him up"?

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.526
We gotta wrap him up.
We gotta get rid of him.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.206
He's a fucking manatee, Joe.
How the fuck are we supposed to do that?

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.601
We have to do it together.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.449
Fucking get him off me!

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.480
Get the fuck off me! Get him off me!

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.604

- Back!
- What the fuck? Die! You fuckin'...

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.330
(GRUNTING)

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.330
We got to call the cops.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.090
We got to call the cops.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.525
- We got to call the cops.
- Shut up.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.125
We got to call them, Joe.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.124
Hey, you fucking idiot. You don't call the cops
on something like this.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.406
They're gonna search the house, Joe.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.289
It was self-defense.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.290
Does this look like self-defense?

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.044
We smashed his fucking head in.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.566
His brains, it looks like fucking gabazelle.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.801
We?

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.087
That's right.

You know what we're gonna do now?

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.405
We're gonna clean this fucking mess up

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.528
and we're gonna take him
and get rid of him, okay?

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.810
Calm down, okay?

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.731
Calm down, son.

Weren't you just at a party?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.048
Yeah, my boss's birthday.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.248
This is work, too. It's a loft party downtown.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:55.881
Your mother has been asking
if I've heard from you.

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.001
Now, as much as I love having you here...

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.209
One more month. Please, Bellamy.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.050
I found a hot band.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.605
Oh, what does that mean?

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.081
It means that I can convince the company
to sign them

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.969
and then they'll make me an A&R rep

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.247
and then I can get a place of my own.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.291

JOE: We'll dump him, they'll find him,

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.526
the cops will think
it's just another drug deal that went bad.

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.162
- And then what?
-"Then what"?

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.451
Richie, you get on with your fucking life.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.809
Won't the cops come around?

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.848
Richie, I told you, you don't know nothing.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.241
Believe me, the last thing
these fucking cops want,

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.164
an investigation on a scumbag like this.

JAMIE: They're raw, like I said,

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.367
but they're edgier than Neon Boys

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.801
and they're angrier than The Dolls.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.963
I went and saw them and they kill it live.

<i>I have no kick against modern</i> jazz

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.964
<i>Unless they try to play it too darn fast</i>

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.850
<i>And change the beauty of the melody</i>

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.730
<i>Until it sounds just like a symphony</i>

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.242
<i>That's why I go for that rock and roll music</i>

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.406
<i>Any old way you choose it</i>

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.563
<i>It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it</i>

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.961
<i>Any old time you use it</i>

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:02.041
<i>It's got to be rock and roll music</i>

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.767
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.044
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.010
<i>I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks</i>

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.924
<i>So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax</i>

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.844
<i>I must admit they have a rocking band</i>

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.446
<i>Man, they were blowing like a hurricane</i>

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.047
<i>That's why I go for that rock and roll music</i>

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.371
<i>Any old way you choose it</i>

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:27.602
<i>It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it</i>

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.681
<i>Any old time you use it</i>

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:34.246
<i>It's got to be rock and roll music</i>

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.928
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.970
<i>Way down South they gave a jubilee</i>

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.520
<i>The jockey folks, they had a jamboree</i>

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:47.729
<i>They're drinking home brew
From a wooden cup</i>

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.326
<i>The folks dancing got all shook up</i>

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:54.530
<i>And started playing that
Rock and roll music</i>

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.211
<i>Any old way you choose it</i>

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:00.443
<i>It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it</i>

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.444
<i>Any old time you use it</i>

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.251
<i>It's got to be rock and roll music</i>

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.448
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.884
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.884
<i>Don't care to hear them play a tango</i>

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.804
<i>I'm in the mood to dig a mambo</i>

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:19.611
<i>It's way too early for a congo</i>

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.365
<i>So keep a-rocking that piano</i>

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.842
<i>So I can hear some of that
Rock and roll music</i>

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.086
<i>Any old way you choose it</i>

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.925
<i>It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it</i>

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.321
<i>Any old time you use it</i>

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:37.886
<i>It's got to be rock and roll music</i>

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.247
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.650
<i>If you want to dance with me</i>
