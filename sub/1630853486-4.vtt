For how long did
your world endure this catastrophe?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.910
- The Great Depression.
It lasted over a decade.

- Sadly, those kinds of societal collapses
used to be pretty common.

the need to buy and sell things

06:57.543 --> 06:59.837

07:23.068 --> 07:26.446
There's a clear
and obvious mutual advantage here.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.824

It never happened.

It's completely fictitious.

oppresses his people.

There are even some from the other side
designed to discredit Teleya,

from her actual speeches.

I asked the Chancellor, and he said
they call it "influence operations."

Teleya is inexperienced.

She's a populist, not a politician.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.316
She's running on rhetoric and fire.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.486
So the Chancellor
thinks that he's still a lock.

He says he trusts
his people to follow the will of Avis.

You've got the President
of the Planetary Union in here.

32:32.744 --> 32:35.664

for starting a war?

32:36.290 --> 32:37.833

32:38.542 --> 32:41.670

of our situation by now.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.005
She'll contact the Union.

32:43.005 --> 32:45.174

hasn't been captured.

32:46.258 --> 32:48.927
- I'm sorry, Ensign,
we never should've brought you along.

32:48.927 --> 32:52.014

mean a declaration of war with the Krill.

32:52.014 --> 32:53.182
Right?

32:53.182 --> 32:55.726
- They've abducted the President.
There's your answer.

32:55.726 --> 32:58.020
- If there's a drawn-out conflict,
it'll weaken our resources.

32:58.020 --> 33:00.647
We can bet the Kaylon will seize
the opportunity to attack.

33:01.148 --> 33:02.608
What then?

33:02.608 --> 33:05.110
- We'll find ourselves fighting
a two-front war.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.404
Of course, so will the Krill.

33:07.404 --> 33:10.699

33:10.699 --> 33:12.117

34:43.500 --> 34:46.003
it's nice to see your face.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.130
- You should feel validated.

34:48.130 --> 34:51.049
Your faith in me
has made this victory possible.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.467
- How so?

34:52.467 --> 34:56.722
- If you had not released me,
I would still be in Union custody.

34:56.722 --> 35:01.310
- I let you go because I believed
we'd found some common ground,

35:01.310 --> 35:04.146
not so you could drive a deeper wedge
between our two peoples.

35:04.146 --> 35:06.315

35:06.940 --> 35:10.319
You were merely too stupid
to resist a false seduction.

but that's not what I'm talking about.

35:14.531 --> 35:18.243
Teleya, we share a common enemy.

35:18.243 --> 35:20.037
And my ensign is right:

35:20.037 --> 35:22.623
if the Kaylon attack us again,
we're gonna need each other.

35:22.623 --> 35:26.960

new and more powerful weapons.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.254
Our fleet is stronger than ever before.

35:30.589 --> 35:33.592
An alliance with outsiders
is no longer necessary.

Korin had a lot of support.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.848

has diminished considerably.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.226
Ask him yourself if you would like.

35:42.226 --> 35:45.354
You will find him
in the center of the Capitol Square.

35:45.354 --> 35:47.397
Or at least his head.

35:48.524 --> 35:49.775
- You killed him.

35:49.775 --> 35:53.111
- Most men who lose their heads
tend to die, yes.

35:53.111 --> 35:54.780
- How could you do that?

35:55.781 --> 35:57.282
Teleya, that's not who you are.

35:57.282 --> 36:00.786
- A year later, you still cling
to an illusion I created.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.330
Captain, you really must
find yourself a...

36:04.206 --> 36:06.041

36:06.041 --> 36:07.125

36:14.299 --> 36:15.801

36:16.468 --> 36:17.803
I was too stupid.

36:21.056 --> 36:22.724

36:24.059 --> 36:26.812
To remind me what an idiot I was?

36:27.396 --> 36:29.857

36:31.024 --> 36:32.526
To be sure it was really you.

36:32.526 --> 36:33.569
- Why?

36:34.736 --> 36:37.990
- I promised my people
the blood of the Union contingent.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.702
- What are you saying?

36:41.702 --> 36:44.746
- You and your colleagues
are to be executed in the morning.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.958
- So you want me dead too?

36:48.917 --> 36:51.170
- I did not know you were part
of the delegation.

36:52.004 --> 36:55.382
- Teleya. I let you go.

36:55.382 --> 36:58.302
I'm asking you to do the same for us.

36:58.302 --> 36:59.428
Now, you may not want a treaty,

36:59.428 --> 37:01.513
but do you really want to start
a war with the Union?

37:04.433 --> 37:07.269
- Take a look around you, Captain.

37:07.269 --> 37:09.521
I now command the full might of Krill.

37:10.147 --> 37:13.400
It is you who should be asking yourself,

37:13.400 --> 37:15.986
is the Union prepared for war with us?

37:18.822 --> 37:23.952
- There's an old Earth verse
that describes a traveler

37:23.952 --> 37:27.414

of an Emperor,

37:27.414 --> 37:32.336

"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.

37:32.336 --> 37:35.714

One can live it in the light of command
or in the darkness of servitude.

46:33.377 --> 46:37.631
- No. No, why would I?

46:37.631 --> 46:40.592

46:40.592 --> 46:43.345
I see a beautiful child.

46:43.345 --> 46:46.682
And something much more: hope.

46:59.194 --> 47:00.237
- What do you mean?

47:00.237 --> 47:03.657
- You must show the child to all of Krill.

Her mother will no longer
be able to deny her existence.

her government, is that it?

47:16.795 --> 47:19.339
Someone else like her
would eventually take her place.

47:19.339 --> 47:22.426
There is always another Teleya.
