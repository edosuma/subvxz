JEZ: <i>Gorgeous Joe. I want to crawl
inside your lovely pink mouth.</i>

00:22.800 --> 00:24.393
Jez, I need to get to work.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.034
Oh, yeah, of course. Me, too.
Busy, busy, busy.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.879
Storage <i>Wars, Walnut Whip,

00:30.920 --> 00:33.389
Cos, like, who's the most famous person
you've life-coached?

00:33.440 --> 00:35.636
I would probably have to say...

00:35.680 --> 00:37.591
<i>Think of someone famous,
think of someone famous.</i>

00:37.640 --> 00:38.516
...the Queen.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.470
<i>Interesting choice.</i>

00:39.520 --> 00:40.316
The Queen?

00:40.360 --> 00:43.876
Yeah, it was either the Queen
or Jenson Button,

00:43.920 --> 00:45.991
but in the end
I'd probably have to say the Queen.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.838
You've life-coached the Queen?

00:47.880 --> 00:53.478
It wasn't just me. A small cadre of life
coaches were airlifted into Highgrove.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.476
What was she like?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.238
She is...

00:56.280 --> 00:57.270
outlandish.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.951
She's funny, she's saucy,
and she's got the filthiest laugh.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.320
Kind of...

01:03.360 --> 01:05.556
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh...

01:05.600 --> 01:07.193
Wow. No offence, Jez,

01:07.240 --> 01:09.959
I just thought your life-coaching
was maybe a part-time thing,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.399
cos you do it out of your bedroom.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.397
(LAUGHS) Oh, Joe.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.670
I have an office, obvs.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.313
- Whereabouts?
- It's...

01:17.360 --> 01:20.990
You know the office block
on the corner of, er, Cowper Street?

01:21.040 --> 01:23.316
- Yeah.
- Oh. You do? Great.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.271
Yeah, well, I have a place there.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.674
I'll have to pay you a visit sometime.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.313
Yep. You do that.

Face forward, please, Jeremy.

01:49.760 --> 01:54.470
- Actually, I'm probably going to go.
- You can't go. This is match point.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.239
Ooh, are we going to win the match?
What if we lose the match?

01:57.280 --> 01:58.600
The match, the match, the match!

01:58.640 --> 02:01.359
Can we just finish the game
and do this afterwards, please?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.357
Fine. If it comes at me again,
I'm not hitting it.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.558
Unlucky, Angus.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.032
Can I go now, cos I am only here
so you can fuck the historian,

02:15.080 --> 02:16.559
and I really don't see that happening.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.592
It's Angus. They've made up
and now he's everywhere.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.632
I invite her to the library,
he offers to give us a lift.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.830
Tennis...he makes it doubles.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.951
I mean, just look at him,
hogging his wife.

So, April, there's a... there's a talk on
at the British Academy on Friday.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.597
Andrew Roberts doing a jam
on World War I trench letters.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.631
<i>Love amongst the mustard gas.</i>

02:52.680 --> 02:54.990
There's literally
only two tickets left, sadly.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.158
<i>Cos I bought the last eight
and burned the other six.</i>

02:58.200 --> 03:00.555
- So I'm wondering if you'd...
- Oh, Mark, I'd love to, but...

03:00.600 --> 03:04.355
It's kind of embarrassing,
but I'm going to have my moles mapped.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.755
- Oh?
- Yeah, I can get a little bit jumpy...

03:06.800 --> 03:10.589
mole-wise. Freckle on my kneecap...
"That wasn't there yesterday!"

03:10.640 --> 03:13.632
Next thing,
I'm picking at it with a craft knife,

03:13.680 --> 03:17.753
trying to cauterise the wound with
one of those creme brûlée torches.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.950
<i>Oh, April and your charming neuroses?!</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:23.072
I've been looking for a half-decent
mole-mapping place for ages.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.590
By no means am I excessively moley,
it's not like I'm riddled.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.314
I'd just like a full body ordnance survey.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.352
Well, that's amazing,
003 not everybody is up for, you know,

03:32.400 --> 03:34.232
having their genitals photographed.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.239
No, I... I am. I'm bang up for that.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.475
Well, be nice to have some company.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.840
It's a date.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.599

dermatological kind of date.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.393
<i>They all count, April! They all count.</i>

03:47.840 --> 03:50.400
How are you feeling today?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.794
Like a piece of shit.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.877
Why is that, do you think?

03:53.920 --> 03:56.594
Because you fucked my boyfriend
and then you stole my boyfriend.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.630
Interesting.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.239
I fucking hate you, Jeremy.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.319
You are unmanly.
And you are basically uninteresting.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.274
And you hide behind this mask of,
like, slacker bullshit,

04:07.320 --> 04:09.436
like the fact you've never done anything
with your life

04:09.480 --> 04:12.791
is some kind of Gen X
lifestyle choice, when really...

04:12.840 --> 04:15.912
it's just because
you're a small, talentless worm.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.757
<i>Hunker down, Jeremy,

04:17.800 --> 04:22.033

04:22.079 --> 04:24.230
You fuck like a little child.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.351
Like an eight-year-old that's just been
told off for sucking its thumb.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.630
- OK, that's all we've got time for today.
- No, it isn't.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.671
We've still got 48 minutes left.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.030
Unless you don't want me
to pay you for the full session?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.310
Let's just dive back in, shall we?

04:35.360 --> 04:36.475
<i>Back into the cesspool.</i>

04:36.520 --> 04:40.309
I'm going to make you cry, Jeremy.
I going to make you cry delicious tears,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.318
and then I'm going to collect
those tears in a little silver bowl

04:43.360 --> 04:45.670
and I'm going to drink them all up.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.830

04:56.120 --> 04:57.918
God, that's romantic, Mark(!) What next?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.110

And I want you to be honest.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.439
It's pepped me up, it really has.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.629
I need to get my act together, Mark.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.035
Yes, well, I may have mentioned
something about this, Jeremy.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.436
I'm just a waster, floating through life,
jazzing into the flannel.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.632
And Joe, he's like this great guy,
and cool job...

05:38.680 --> 05:40.239
Sorry, you jazz into the flannel?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.714
Oh, don't be so fucking parochial, Mark.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.912
I'm laying it out there, the inner churn,
the workings of man,

05:44.960 --> 05:47.793
and you're hung up on whose jizz
ends up on what bit of cloth.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.956
- Which flannel, Jeremy?
- I don't know!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.877
I can't be expected to remember
where it all goes.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.558
Right!

05:57.800 --> 06:00.235
Which flannel have you jazzed on?

06:00.280 --> 06:01.679

You know what? You're right,
I've gone too far this time, Mark.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.350
Well, I am turning a corner.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.789
I'm growing up

06:59.480 --> 07:00.470
Actually, Jez, it's lucky you're here,

07:00.520 --> 07:04.195
cos young Mr Wade here has been off
working at a Center Paras,

07:04.240 --> 07:06.993
- isn't that right, Wadey?
- Yeah, that's right, Hans.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.474
I've been working at a Center Parcs.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.150
Yeah. But he's been made redundant,
sadly.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.113
And I'm thinking maybe
you could have a little chat with him.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.630
Oh, is this about your self-esteem?
Yeah?

07:18.680 --> 07:23.038

You know your mate Mark?

07:30.120 --> 07:32.191
Can you get me his swipe card
for the bank?

07:32.240 --> 07:33.992
What's that, sorry?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.873
His swipe card that gets him in the back
of the bank. Can you get it for me?

- Super Hans, quick hatter?
- Mmm.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.154
All right.

Is he a fucking bank robber?

Behave!

07:48.280 --> 07:50.078
He's not a bank robber, Jeremy.

It had to be for the general reader.
He was really very insistent about that.

09:28.760 --> 09:29.909
How interesting.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.758
<i>Do 5 detect a mental defect?</i>

09:31.800 --> 09:34.235
Next thing I know, he's gone off
to Turkey for five months.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.590
Checked himself into a hostel
in Marmaris.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.790
He out these kind of tramlines
into his hair.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.434
He'd written the Nicene Creed
all over his legs.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.312
April, that's...that's awful.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.670
<i>I smell it, the sweet stench of weakness.</i>

09:45.720 --> 09:48.838
Maybe he's going back to that.
I don't know, maybe I'm losing him again.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.838
<i>All aboard the Coconut Express.
Next stop, Loony Town!</i>

09:53.280 --> 09:57.069
Yeah. I need quite a lot of storage space
for my personal effects

09:57.120 --> 09:58.713
when hiring an office.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.592
Cos I've ordered a briefcase off Amazon.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.074
It's coming from Holland.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.475
What's. ...?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.512
Oh, my God, there's a socket in the floor!

10:07.560 --> 10:09.119
Unbelievable!

10:09.160 --> 10:12.516
Um, do you monitor the things
I look at on the internet?

10:12.560 --> 10:13.880
- Great.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.150
<i>I love</i> this office.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.077
It's £400 per calendar month.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.555
Four? 400?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.398
Fuck my mouth!

10:22.440 --> 10:24.431
This is nice, isn't it?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.278
A goodly stroll.
<i>Invite</i> him out for a walk,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.675
<i>lure him into a Greek Orthodox Church,</i>

10:28.720 --> 10:31.189
<i>precipitate an insanity spiral.</i>

10:31.240 --> 10:33.834
<i>My plan certainly has become
quite Byzantine!</i>

10:33.880 --> 10:37.555
Mark, I understand you went
mole mapping with my wife?

10:37.600 --> 10:41.195
<i>Oh. . yeah, we went for 3 “Ne checkup.</i>

10:41.240 --> 10:42.560
The old mole patrol.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.557
- I <i>was</i> wondering...
<i>- Is this a wallop/fig?</i>

10:44.600 --> 10:46.637
...if you'd like to come
for a colonoscopy.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.193
Right.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.389
I've been putting it off for some months

10:49.440 --> 10:51.670
and I thought, "Seems like
it might be in Mark's wheelhouse."

10:51.720 --> 10:53.074
You know, guys looking out for each other?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.838
Yeah, no, it sounds great.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.919
We could go for a pint after. You know,
get the cancer-y bit out of the way

10:58.960 --> 11:01.270
and then pop into the Whistle
for a pint of IPA.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.357
<i>Rectal exams with the love rival?</i>

11:03.400 --> 11:04.470
And thanks...

11:04.520 --> 11:06.272
for taking April. She needed that.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.709
She needs an outlet.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.400
Some nights she's like,
"Let's take drugs and go crazy."

11:11.440 --> 11:14.353
And I'm thinking
Herodotus and a bowl of muesli.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.754
It's just not me.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.111
<i>Tell me your Wife's secret desires.
They'll be safe with me!</i>

11:19.160 --> 11:21.037
Say, that's an interesting church.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.115
Is it Russian?

11:22.160 --> 11:24.071
Yes, a Russian Orthodox Church.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.190
How fascinating.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.197
Er, I believe it's Greek, Mark.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.393
OK, well, I propose a wager, good sir.
Loser buys the ploughman's?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.272
Oh, I'll buy you a ploughman's, Angus,

11:33.320 --> 11:38.679
<i>But it'll be the last ploughman's
you eat as a sane man.</i>

11:38.720 --> 11:41.473
In terms of praxis, the difference
between Russian and Greek

11:41.520 --> 11:43.193
just comes down to order of service.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.675
<i>Put on the tap shoes,
quick dance on his grave.</i>

11:45.720 --> 11:49.156
And is there a comprehensive history
of the Byzantine Church

11:49.200 --> 11:52.033
you could recommend, you know,
for the general reader?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.640
OK, I'm going to surprise you here,
Mark, and say no, there isn't,

11:54.680 --> 11:58.435
unless you include John Julius Norwich's
so-called <i>History</i> Of <i>Byzantium,</i>

11:58.480 --> 11:59.470
and I don't.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.160
Right. Cos you've got Simon Baker on Rome

12:02.200 --> 12:05.397
and Karen Armstrong
on the Western Christian tradition,

12:05.440 --> 12:07.795
but nothing on the Byzantine Church?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.956
Doesn't that just seem insane?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.229
It does seem a little nutty.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.715
<i>This isn't horrible.
I'm just encouraging him.</i>

12:13.760 --> 12:17.310
<i>Follow your dream, Angus,
all the way into the big mind mincer.</i>

12:17.360 --> 12:20.478
And the only first-hand account
we have is, as you'll know,

12:20.520 --> 12:22.830
Martin <i>of</i> Opava's
<i>Chronicon Pontificum Er Imperatorum,,</i>

12:22.880 --> 12:24.598
and, frankly, it's a pamphlet.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.756
It's so limited in scope
as to be almost worthless.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.950
<i>God, this really is interesting.</i>

12:29.000 --> 12:32.595
<i>No, don't get sucked in!
Otherwise it's going to be me and Angus</i>

12:32.640 --> 12:36.873
<i>sleeping in a Turkish hostel, reading
Scripture and getting rectal exams.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:40.033
<i>MARK“. Cup of tea and a Twirl.</i>

12:40.080 --> 12:42.390
<i>Finally get</i> a proper <i>look at my</i> arse.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.876
<i>Yep, there he is,
that's my arse, all right.</i>

12:45.920 --> 12:47.319
<i>The dark side of the moon.</i>

12:47.360 --> 12:48.680
JEZ: So, Mark, I got your letter.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.189
That's not from me, Jeremy,
that's from the bank.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.595
It's a standard loan statement.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.393
Do you have any idea of the monthly
repayments on that fucking thing?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.317
Yes, Jeremy. Yes, I do.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.873
So that's it? Office gone.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.274
There's no way I can afford it any more.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.152
All my hopes and dreams,
everything I've been working for

13:03.200 --> 13:06.113
for the last 39 years
flushed down the toilet.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.231
You've wanted this office since yesterday.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.840
You never should have sold me that loan,
Mark. You were exploiting me.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.679
Well, guess what,
I've got one word for you.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.074
Ombudsman.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.316
- Ha!
- I'm going to the ombudsman.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.034
So if there's a bang at the door
and you answer it

13:20.080 --> 13:24.756
and there's a man in a stovepipe hat
with a long, hooky stick, that's him.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.835
The ombudsman.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.759
The ombudsman isn't a person, Jeremy.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.871
It's a toothless regulatory body

13:30.920 --> 13:35.232
made up of junior
and often very obliging civil servants.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.429
One eye open, Mark.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.269
(SINGSONG) The ombudsman's
coming to get you.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.876
You know, Angus would have been
more than welcome to...

13:47.920 --> 13:49.638
Yeah, he...didn't fancy it.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.069
I caught him
reading the Nicene Creed on the toilet.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.838
Oh, April...

13:53.880 --> 13:56.110
you are joking?!
<i>Ting!</i> I

13:56.160 --> 13:58.151
He said you went to a Byzantine church?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.599
Look, I...“

13:59.640 --> 14:03.429
I didn't want to dob him in,
but we went for a stroll and...

14:03.480 --> 14:05.153
It was like he couldn't help himself.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.714
I mean, we went for
a ploughman's afterwards,

14:07.760 --> 14:09.637
but the mood was pretty sombre.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.115
<i>So I ate both his pickled onions!</i>

14:13.280 --> 14:17.433
You know, April, it's at times like this
when I just want to throw my hands up

14:17.480 --> 14:20.393
and say, "Let's take drugs and go crazy."

14:20.440 --> 14:21.350
Hm!

14:23.880 --> 14:25.359
MARK: Oh, God, <i>help</i> me.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.710
God, I haven't done this since uni.
Am I doing it right?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.115
Yeah, no, that's great.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.232
Some lovely fat lines of Chang.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.237
Do you always have coke lying around,
you big druggie?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.191
It's leftovers from Super Hans' stag.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.916
But it's good shit, it's real top-quality,
Taste the Difference shit.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.031
<i>Let the Great British Snort Off</i> begin.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.679
<i>Eye of the tiger. Fuck you, everyone.</i>

14:46.720 --> 14:47.710
<i>Fuck you, Dad.</i>

14:47.760 --> 14:49.114
(SNORTS)

14:50.920 --> 14:52.433
Oh... Mmm.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.471
Delicious. As always.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.670
Mein compliments to the chef.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.792
<i>Christ, it's gone all the way up my nose
and into my throat.</i>

14:59.840 --> 15:02.036
<i>It doesn't taste very nice.
What if it's off?</i>

15:02.080 --> 15:05.118
<i>What if my head swells up like a melon
and I never sleep again?</i>

15:05.160 --> 15:07.356
I feel completely normal. But also...

15:07.400 --> 15:11.030
a bit like I want to karate-chop my hand
through a very high stack of poppadoms.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.198
You could hold up a keema naan
and I could punch my fist through it.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.594
Kung fu-ed.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.870
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

15:19.200 --> 15:21.157
<i>I have never been this intensely funny.</i>

15:21.200 --> 15:23.191
Angus would never do this.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.880
Unless we'd talked about it
and tabled it with our therapist

15:25.920 --> 15:28.434
and dissected it to death.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.120
Oh, tedious.
I mean, I don't even want another line.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.629
The last thing I feel like
is another line.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.993
<i>Well, that's it; I'm an addict.</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:41.273
But that was actually probably
my favourite line of the two.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.994
Cos I found this cruise, OK? Three
months in the Med, just what we need.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.680
God, she's <i>trying to
patch things up with Angus.</i>

15:46.720 --> 15:47.790
<i>God, my teeth are dry?!</i>

15:47.840 --> 15:50.958
Cocktails, six meals a day, bad karaoke.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.320
He said no.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.034
April, if I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.229
<i>The first time We ever said it.</i>

15:56.280 --> 15:59.671
You've got to live in the moment,
003 right now I feel like

15:59.720 --> 16:02.838
staying up all night,
or running to Thornton Heath,

16:02.880 --> 16:04.678
or throwing my iPad out the window.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.791
- Go on, then.
- Yeah?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.990
I mean, which? Cos I'll do it.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.236
<i>- ”Pad
- Yeah, cos "K's "psi an "Pad.</i>

16:11.280 --> 16:14.671
I mean, what is it, really?
Just some very thin microchips.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.358
- Go on.
- I'm going to do it.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.233
Don't you think I should do it?
I'm totally doing it. Should I do it?

16:19.280 --> 16:21.317
- You should totally do it.
- I'm totally doing it.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.196
<i>Regretting act of spontaneity
before I've completed act of spontaneity.</i>

16:26.240 --> 16:27.753
Bye- bye !

16:27.800 --> 16:29.791
Fuck you, iPad!

16:29.840 --> 16:31.990
- I can't believe you just did that.
- I know.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.793
You're like the Incredible Hulk.
The Incredible Mark.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.673
(AS HULK) Mark smash!

16:37.720 --> 16:39.154
<i>She thinks I'm funny.</i>

16:39.200 --> 16:42.397
Mark smash!

16:42.440 --> 16:44.511
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

16:46.360 --> 16:47.680
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

16:47.720 --> 16:49.233
(THEY KISS)

16:50.440 --> 16:51.760
I should get going.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.918
But thank you for an amazing evening.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.315
<i>I've kissed her. I've kissed her on coke.</i>

16:57.360 --> 16:59.920
<i>If we take smack,
maybe she'll get divorced and many me.</i>

17:02.600 --> 17:03.590
I've got you the goods.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.835
HANS: Mark's swipe card.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.711
Yeah.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.355
But on one condition.
Say pub man is a bank robber,

17:09.400 --> 17:12.358
we tell him no shooting of Mark.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.277
And that is an absolute red line.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.640
<i>God, I'm a good friend.</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:17.193
<i>I've really stuck my neck out
for Mark there.</i>

17:17.240 --> 17:19.470
Look, hang on to it for now.

17:19.520 --> 17:23.069
Let's just say young Mr Wade's attempts
not to rob Mark's bank

17:23.119 --> 17:25.430
have taken a surprising unexpected turn.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.357
- Like what?
- He's basically doing it right now.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.152
Hang on. But he's not actually
going to do it, though?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.760
Well, it's hard to tell with Wadey.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.996
Don't get me wrong, he's a teddy bear.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.439
But he's a violent teddy bear.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.993
You said he was harmless.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.316
Well, he's more than one thing, Jeremy.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.112
He's harmless, he's deadly.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.514
He's a devil, he's a saint.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.358
He's happy, he's furious.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.392
He's got a multiple-personality disorder,
basically.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.149
Shit! Right, text pub man,
tell him not to shoot Mark.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.235
I've got to warn him.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.033
<i>What if he's already shot him?
What if he's wounded him?</i>

17:55.080 --> 17:57.833
God, <i>imagine Mark in a Wheelchair.
He'll be insufferable.</i>

17:58.800 --> 18:02.350
MARK: <i>I need something new to throw out
the Window before April loses interest.</i>

18:02.400 --> 18:06.280
<i>Could bung my George Foreman
off the balcony.</i>

18:06.320 --> 18:07.355
Oh, sorry, mate.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.356
<i>Oh, it's grudge time</i>

18:08.400 --> 18:10.311
<i>with Jerry.
When is he ever going to forgive me</i>

18:10.360 --> 18:13.079
<i>for bundling him into a sleeping bag
and throwing him in a lift?</i>

18:13.120 --> 18:14.269
Mark?

18:14.320 --> 18:17.392
Oh, Angus, hi. I wasn't expecting...

18:17.440 --> 18:22.037
So, I found a place that does something
called an air-contrast barium enema.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.151
They basically pump air into the rectum.

18:24.200 --> 18:28.034
Apparently, you get an incredibly clear
silhouette of the whole downstairs area.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.753
Sounds perfect.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.189
<i>Inflating my colon
like a weather balloon?!</i>

18:32.240 --> 18:35.119
I'm not here to talk to you
about a colonoscopy, Mark.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.753
I need a loan. 5K.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.191
I think I'm losing April
and... and she wants this cruise.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.392
I don't know, I feel like if we go away
together, that might fix everything.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.158
Sure. Sure it might.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.760
Well, let me just enter your details
into the system.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.031
<i>Look at me, I'm entering his details
into the system.</i>

18:51.080 --> 18:55.074
<i>Telephone, telephone, sunglasses,
smiley face, crucifix, and "enter".</i>

18:55.120 --> 18:59.876
Oh, Angus, your credit rating is,
frankly, sub-Grecian.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.319
Look, I have mortgage statements.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.478
Mate, I'm... I'm sorry. It's a no.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.919
<i>Three-ways spite-feast!</i>

19:05.960 --> 19:08.759
<i>No commission for me, no cruise for April,</i>

19:08.800 --> 19:10.473
<i>no marriage for Angus.</i>

19:10.520 --> 19:12.272
<i>And it tastes great!</i>

19:12.320 --> 19:16.109
Mark, I need five, like,
quite intense minutes right now.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.150
Hi, Angus.

19:21.400 --> 19:27.237
Just FYI sort of thing,
there is a very slim possibility that...

19:27.280 --> 19:31.239
a bank robber is heading into
the bank right now.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.831
So, you know, act normal,
but also be on permanent high alert.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.393
Jeremy, what are you talking about?

19:37.440 --> 19:40.432
It's just some mate of Super Hans,
some pub man.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.994
A pub man? I-I'm getting robbed?

19:43.040 --> 19:46.635
No, it's all fine, because I told Hans
to tell him, "No shooting Mark."

19:46.680 --> 19:49.035
What do you mean, no shooting?
I was going to get shot?

19:49.080 --> 19:50.673
No. Because it was a red line.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.314
Oh, and no-one ever goes over a red line,
do they, Jeremy(?)

19:53.360 --> 19:55.033
Tuition fees was a fucking red line.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.833
Look, it's just a caper gone bad.
He wanted your swipe card

19:57.880 --> 20:00.998
and then I took it,
but then I didn't give it to him...

20:01.040 --> 20:03.873
You took it? Jesus Christ, Jeremy!

20:03.920 --> 20:05.672
Come on, Mark, on your high horse.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.280
It's a bank. They're insured.
It's a victimless crime.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.392
No, Jeremy, it isn't. It's a victimy
crime, and the victim is me!

20:11.440 --> 20:12.839
I'm going to get shot.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.793
Oh, how many times, Mark?
You are not getting...

20:17.720 --> 20:20.997
You are not getting shot.
Why does it always have to be about you?

20:21.040 --> 20:25.591
I'm sorry, Jeremy. I'm sorry for being all
self-pitying about my potential shooting.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.792
- In a way, you do work in a bank.
- What's that supposed to mean?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.877
I mean, come Oh, you're probably due one.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.718
Oh, great. I'm due one, am I?

20:32.760 --> 20:36.355
I'm due a good shooting?
It's my turn for the big, shiny bullet?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.118
Oh, shit.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.310
MARK: Is...? Is that him?
Is that the robber?

20:41.360 --> 20:43.112
Shit, where's the panic button?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.469
I can't find the panic button.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.079
I'm panicking

20:48.120 --> 20:49.952
- and I can't find the panic...
- Just fucking calm down, Mark,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.229
for fuck's sake!

20:51.280 --> 20:53.112
Why do they make these bloody things
so hard to find?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.437
Will you stop panicking?
He's just some nutter.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.233
Exactly. He's a nutter, Jeremy,
a nutter who may

20:59.280 --> 21:02.352
or may not have got the memo
re not shooting me.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.831
He's queueing.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.518
Why's he queueing? Robbers don't queue.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.675
We need to leave.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.791
What if he shoots everyone?

21:11.840 --> 21:15.674
He won't. And if he does,
what are we supposed to do? Stop him?

21:15.720 --> 21:18.155
Yeah, that's what we'll do, Mark.
We'll stop him(!)

21:18.200 --> 21:20.237
We'll stop the armed maniac,
me and you(!)

21:20.280 --> 21:22.590
MARK: <i>I'm not running away,
I'm just walking over here</i>

21:22.640 --> 21:25.473
<i>to reassess the situation.
All the way over here and out of the bank.</i>

21:25.520 --> 21:26.510
It's fine.

21:26.560 --> 21:30.235
Everything's going to be fine.
No-one's getting shot.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.949
Right, we need to move. He's quite
obviously going to shoot everyone.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.355
What? What am I doing?
I need to go back in!

21:39.400 --> 21:40.674
What about Angus?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.518
He's a cadaver, Mark. He's toast.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.996
Coffee shop. We'll wait in the coffee shop
until the shooting stops.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.754
Macchiato and a blueberry muffin, please.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.598
A muffin? You're going to stand here,
waiting for a massacre, eating a muffin?

22:00.640 --> 22:03.359
- What difference does it make?
- Unbelievable.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.199
Er, flat white extra hot and a biscotti.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.719
But this is on you.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.831
I'm holding you fully accountable.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.553
<i>You know what. .. $02.</i>

22:11.600 --> 22:14.035
"$02" is not an appropriate level
of apology

22:14.080 --> 22:16.594
for facilitating an armed fucking robbery.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.278
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Joe?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.469
<i>- Jez.
-</i> Hey.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.397
<i>I'm at the offices on Cowper Street.
They don't seem to know who you are.</i>

22:21.440 --> 22:24.398
Oh, er, sorry, I can't really hear you.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.158
I'm just at Highgrove.

22:26.200 --> 22:31.274
In fact, Joe, there's
a very distinguished older gentleman

22:31.320 --> 22:33.914
who'd really like to have a word
with you right now.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.076
- Do a Prince Philip.
- What?

22:36.120 --> 22:39.158
Do a Prince Philip and I'll go
and tackle the robber, or whatever.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.679
Oh, Christ.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.077
No, I'm not doing a fucking Prince Philip.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.079
Er, sorry about that, Joe.
He's famously flighty.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.714
<i>You're not really at Highgrove,
are you, Jeremy?</i>

22:52.760 --> 22:54.592
Er, no.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.914
I'm actually at Balmoral.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.474
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Hello? Hello?

22:59.840 --> 23:00.830
He's gone.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.918
It's happening, then.
Joe's starting to see through me.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.270
Really, Jeremy?
Tell me more, 003 I am so invested

23:06.320 --> 23:08.789
in your domestic horseshit right now(!)

23:08.840 --> 23:10.239
Mark...

23:10.280 --> 23:11.475
What the hell are you doing over here?

23:11.520 --> 23:14.194
Oh, hi, Alan. Just on a quick coffee run.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.674
Oh, really?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.757
Hanging out with your little buddy? Hm?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.950
Playing conkers with your little chum?
Get back to work.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.594
- What about my coffee?
- I'll bring it. Exit...

23:22.640 --> 23:24.119
Mark.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.480
Jeremy, are you coming?

23:29.640 --> 23:30.710
Sorry, mate.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.273
Right.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.118
Off I go.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.150
On my own.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.118
Off on my merry way.

23:40.480 --> 23:44.269
MARK: <i>No-one</i> seems <i>dead.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.311
<i>Oh, God, here he goes.</i>

23:46.360 --> 23:48.510
<i>Oh, he's bottled it;.</i>

23:48.560 --> 23:50.119
<i>He's just a big, beardy pen thief.</i>

23:50.160 --> 23:52.720
Mark, it's going through.
Your mate sorted it.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.034
We're going cruising!

23:55.160 --> 23:57.470
Brilliant, Angus. I'm-I'm happy for you.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.635
Thanks, Jerry.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.991
Oh, not a problem, Mark.
I'd happily steal your sales all daylong.
