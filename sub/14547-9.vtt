For Dalia Royce, packing light
had never been a strong suit

baggage she wasn't bringing.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.076
Sweet tea?

10:20.995 --> 10:23.456
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh.. ♪♪

10:25.958 --> 10:27.835
- I want to switch.
- No, you don't.

10:27.877 --> 10:28.878
- Yes, I do.
- No.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.379
Mine's got a clicking jaw.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.797
Every time she chews,
I can hear it.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.008
She's got like
a mechanical pencil on her face.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.845
- That's her jaw?
- That's her jaw.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.388
Mine is married.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.183
Yeah, she's just here
for support, like Fred.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.519
So the cooler has his hooks
in the only eligible one?

10:45.561 --> 10:47.480
He got..

10:47.521 --> 10:51.317
- Linda.
- He, he got Linda.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.612
My jaw may click,
but my hearing's just fine.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.790
Tonight, our spirits are low,
but our hair is high.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.917
- Well, mostly.
- Are you kidding?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.669
I had trouble
clearing the doorway.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.879
I can barely hold my head up.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.173
Sunset-Laemmle, say grace.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.550
Oh, why does she always
get to say grace?

11:16.592 --> 11:18.969
She ain't holier than me.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.013
Dear Lord,
thank you for the fried food

11:21.055 --> 11:24.266
we are about to receive,
and also thank you

11:24.308 --> 11:27.520
for the broiled peanuts
and-and the shrimp and grits

11:27.561 --> 11:30.773
seeing as,
those were her favorites.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.899
Let's eat.

11:31.941 --> 11:32.942
Before we do so

11:32.983 --> 11:35.653
I would like to say a few words.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.613
Heaven surely shines
a little brighter tonight

11:37.655 --> 11:41.867
knowing that my sweet mama
has entered its gates.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.202
Amen. Let's eat.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.538
I would also like to say
a few words myself.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.999
Mama, as your firstborn,
we shared a special bond

11:49.041 --> 11:52.086
you didn't share with any of
your subsequent children. Amen.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.131
Mama, you were the wind
beneath my wings.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.340
You were the apple of my eye.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.591
You were the cream in my coffee.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.928
You were my blood diamond, mama.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.264
Well, I think it's clear

12:03.305 --> 12:05.850
you both loved your mama
very much and equally so.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.309
You were my "November Rain."

12:07.351 --> 12:08.936
You were
my "Hunt For Red October."

12:08.978 --> 12:10.980
- I never left her side.
- She never left my heart.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.566
- She was my best friend.
- She was my twin!

12:16.235 --> 12:17.528
Okay, well, let's eat.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.363
I don't want the boiled peanuts
to get cold.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.657
Oh, they're already cold
and weirdly slimy.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.492
- I hate them. Hubba?
- Thank you.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.870
Mama lived and died
with me by her side

12:25.911 --> 12:28.205
and everybody in this family
knows of my dedication to her

12:28.247 --> 12:29.999
but did, did y'all know about

12:30.040 --> 12:32.126
the things
that mama did for me, huh?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.420
How she cheered me up
when I was sick?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.757
- Mama was my Patch Adams!
- She was so patient.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.216
She taught me how to
do things that she--

12:39.258 --> 12:40.259
She was my Mr. Miyagi.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.385
- Dallas!
- What?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.763
Stop trying to out eulogize me.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.181
This whole family knows
that you did not

12:45.222 --> 12:47.808
give a pickled
rat's ass about mama.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.060
- Is that what this is?
- Now, look here.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.520
We may have been estranged

12:51.562 --> 12:54.106
but that does not mean
mama was not the cherry

12:54.148 --> 12:56.692
in my coke because she was.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.070
She made me who I am.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.701
She was my Geppetto!

13:05.743 --> 13:07.661
Meanwhile, back in Chatswin

13:07.703 --> 13:09.705
there was only one couple
on the group date

13:09.747 --> 13:11.207
who'd found the recipe
for love.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.501
And what I like to do
is add just a dash of cinnamon

13:13.542 --> 13:15.252
to the peach reduction
to infuse it with

13:15.294 --> 13:16.629
a what-the-huh flavor.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.840
[chuckles]
Fred, you're reckless.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.259
- Well.
- And married, you know?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.677
I'm sorry?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.638
My man Fred here,
he's matrimonious

13:25.679 --> 13:29.099
as in off the market, un-avails.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.684
Is that true?

13:30.726 --> 13:32.770
- I am afraid so.
- Fred, no.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.313
You know what,
maybe we should call it a night?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.065
Ladies, thank you
for a wonderful evening.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.733
I'm sorry it didn't work out
for any of us.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.236
Fred, I'd really
like to keep in touch.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.946
- Oh.
- Even if it's just as friends.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.907
Um, we could swap recipes.
I'll send you peach crumble.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.742
I'll send you
ooey-gooey-chewy cookies.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.952
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.287
[laughs]

13:50.329 --> 13:52.832
(Tessa)
'Those were beautiful things
you said at dinner tonight.'

13:52.873 --> 13:54.291
(Dallas)
'Tessa, can I be
honest with you?'

13:54.333 --> 13:57.044
My mama was a narcissistic

13:57.086 --> 14:01.173
punishing, alienating sea bitch.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.551
She came from the..

14:03.592 --> 14:06.136
Sea. I always felt so.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.222
So all those things
you said at dinner..

14:08.264 --> 14:09.682
That's how mama liked it.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.725
Everyone fighting over
who loved her more.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.143
And every time
I walk through this door

14:13.185 --> 14:14.520
it's like
I'm eight years old again,

14:14.562 --> 14:16.188
trying to prove myself.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.066
Dallas, take it
from someone who has..

14:19.108 --> 14:22.361
...mommy issues of their own.

14:22.403 --> 14:26.448
If you don't talk about it,
it never goes away.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.035
I think you owe it to yourself

14:30.077 --> 14:32.955
to have an honest conversation
with her about your feelings.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.292
But it's too late.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.753
Is it?

14:44.425 --> 14:47.595
You never supported me.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.931
You pushed me into marriage
before I was ready.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.769
You criticized every choice
I ever made.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.567
Go on. She can handle it.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.905
And I really could
have used your support

15:05.946 --> 15:09.199
when I went through
that nasty divorce with Steven.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.243
I'll never understand
why you had to make

15:11.285 --> 15:14.121
everything a competition
between Georgia and me.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.540
[sighs]

15:16.582 --> 15:19.168
I suppose the answer
to all these questions

15:19.209 --> 15:22.004
now lies at the bottom
of the sea.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.762
Oh, down in the bubbly blue..

15:34.266 --> 15:37.311
Where you came from...sea bitch.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.397
Okay. That'll do.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.775
Congratulations, Dallas.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.193
You did it.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.362
Yeah.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.658
I guess I did.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.327
I should have never exchanged
my particulars with that woman.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.038
- She has my particulars!
- Fred, relax!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.122
(Fred)
I took a toke.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.165
It was laced with Linda

15:58.207 --> 15:59.792
and I got high off her flow.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.127
Now I'm coming down.
I'm legit tripping.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.380
And half of me thinks
shorty's gonna blow up my spot.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.173
[cell phone vibrating]
She is..

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
She's gonna blow up my spot.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.427
[cell phone vibrates]

16:10.469 --> 16:12.429
[grunting]

16:23.315 --> 16:25.109
You handled that nicely.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.778
E-mail. I have to change
my e-mail. Okay.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.488
Alright.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.198
[Noah chuckles]

16:31.240 --> 16:32.866
She's trying to reach
you cross-platform!

16:32.908 --> 16:34.368
No, don't click on it!

16:34.410 --> 16:37.162
Fred, look at the subject line.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.499
- It's a cookie recipe. Relax.
- Okay.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.084
You've got nothing
to worry about.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.127
Okay.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
Hi, Fred.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.424
I promised to show you
my warm, drippy cookies

16:48.465 --> 16:50.050
and I'm about to.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.136
I'm about to show you how
I like to put them in my mouth.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.097
- Oh, don't you dare.
- Oh, don't you dare, Fred.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.140
[grunts]

16:56.181 --> 16:58.100
Listen to me. Don't you dare.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.645
(Linda)
'Fred! It's so hot.'

17:01.687 --> 17:07.067
Oh, I didn't expect it
to be so...hot.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.486
[giggles]

17:09.528 --> 17:11.363
You are perfect. I love you.

17:11.405 --> 17:17.036
Ooh. Can you believe how drippy
and molten the insides are?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.163
Ohh! I can't watch.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.415
- Oh, Fred, these cookies.
- I can.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.125
Oh. Mmm.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.919
- Oh. Lick your lips.
- Don't lick them.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.421
You lick your lips.

17:28.922 --> 17:32.051
- Yes!
- Oh.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.303
- Ahh.
- Oh.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.098
(Sheila)
'Fred!'

17:41.393 --> 17:43.645
What's going on here?
Why do you have a friend over?

17:43.687 --> 17:45.355
- It's a school night.
- Hello, Mrs. Shay.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.107
What kind of trouble
are you boys getting into?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.651
No kind of trouble at all, dear.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.153
We were just, uh, watching--

17:51.195 --> 17:53.822
Snuff porn. Saved it.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.201
Noah, that kind of filth
may be fine in your household

17:57.242 --> 17:58.911
but Fred has not been
exposed to that.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.788
It is not appropriate for him.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.540
Remember, he is quite
a bit younger than you are.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.125
- What?
- He looks up to you.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.835
Because I'm taller.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.463
Come on, there's no way
that Fred is younger than me.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.048
Well, I'll tell you
what's not getting any younger

18:11.090 --> 18:13.801
is the rump I'm roasting
for Sheila's dinner.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.386
I'll, uh, just start
by clearing the table.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.431
Start by removing
this cumbersome laptop.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.602
Putting it in this drawer
and swallowing the key.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.191
[chuckles]
Hope everyone likes
little potatoes.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.112
How old do you think I am?

18:37.991 --> 18:39.201
(Fred)
'Okay, here's the plan.'

18:39.243 --> 18:40.869
I cough up the key,
we unlock the drawer

18:40.911 --> 18:43.288
you dispose of the evidence,
Sheila's never the wiser, okay.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.291
[coughing]

18:47.584 --> 18:50.129
Dad, it's already unlocked.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.589
- Why is it?
- Looking for something, boys?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.550
Uh, uh..

18:54.591 --> 18:56.969
I see your knuckles
are bloody, my love.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.178
Are they?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.681
Did you have an accident
of some sort?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.559
- I'll go get a Band-Aid.
- Now, don't you go anywhere!

19:03.600 --> 19:06.436
Uh, hey,
what's that stubborn matter

19:06.478 --> 19:08.689
you're scraping from
beneath your nails there?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.440
Some of its dirt.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.402
Some of its semi-sweet morsels.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.363
And the rest of it...is Linda.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.615
- I've got homework.
- Aah, oh.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.830
My sweets are the only treats

19:24.872 --> 19:28.834
you should be sampling,
Fred Shay.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.378
Remember that.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.881
And help Linda
remember that too.

19:33.922 --> 19:37.384
Since I suspect her
short-term memory may be..

19:37.426 --> 19:39.303
...spotty from now on.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.805
Ooh. Kitty has claws.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.975
But she's alive, right?

19:45.017 --> 19:48.103
Don't worry. I didn't touch
a hair on her head.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.355
I just tripped and fell
after pooping in her mailbox.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.941
- Ooh.
- She's been warned.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.199
(Dallas)
'Well, made it
through the funeral'

20:00.240 --> 20:02.242
and I can't thank you enough

20:02.284 --> 20:04.578
for being ol' dirty bastard
to my Mariah.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.372
You're very welcome, Dallas.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.957
Hey, do you want to
come in or something?

20:08.999 --> 20:12.377
No, thanks. I think I've had
enough turmoil for one day.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.670
I don't need to see your daddy

20:13.712 --> 20:15.422
and his new girlfriend
canoodling.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.299
Oh. No, they broke up.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.551
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.762
- How sad.
- George seems fine about it.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.056
- Oh.
- Goodnight.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644
Hey. You made it back
in one piece.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.313
I need a hot shower
and a triple bypass.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.150
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.402
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.030
That gal of yours
is pretty special.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.823
Yeah.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.909
Hey, uh..

20:43.951 --> 20:45.786
...I'm sorry about
your mom passing, Dallas.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.705
I wanted to...offer
my condolences.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.041
Oh. Back at you.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.376
May Nora rest in peace.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.544
Heard you stamped out
your latest flame.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.756
Yeah, well, you know,
relationships are complicated.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.008
And she's a great girl
with a warm heart

21:00.050 --> 21:02.052
and I wish her the best.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.264
Dud in the sack?

21:05.305 --> 21:06.723
[chuckles]

21:08.100 --> 21:10.894
Well, they can't all
be Dallas Royce.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.313
No, sir, they cannot.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.075
Fred could be your father, okay?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.244
He could be your [beep] father.
