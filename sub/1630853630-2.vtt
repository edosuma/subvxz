WEBVTT

00:40.583 --> 00:42.708
Looks like another busy day,
ain't it, Mochi?

00:44.916 --> 00:45.916
Simon?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.125
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.791
Refill. Coming in hot.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.875
-Thanks, Cass.
-How's the novel coming?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.458
Pretty good-ish.

00:56.958 --> 00:59.083
-I see a new haircut.
-You noticed?

00:59.166 --> 01:00.166
(OVEN DINGS)

01:01.625 --> 01:02.625
Ooh!

01:05.291 --> 01:07.625
-How's the muffin?
-Really good.

01:07.708 --> 01:08.708
CASS: Agnes.

01:10.625 --> 01:11.625
(DINGS)

01:11.708 --> 01:12.708
Jorge.

01:14.916 --> 01:17.291
Morning, Cass.
Doing anything fun this weekend?

01:17.375 --> 01:20.083
Sayaka, the cafe is all the fun I need...

01:20.166 --> 01:21.166
(YELLS)

01:21.500 --> 01:22.500
-(GASPS)
-(CASS GROANS)

01:23.291 --> 01:24.958
CASS: Ow! (INHALES SHARPLY)

01:25.041 --> 01:26.250
My ankle.

01:26.583 --> 01:27.750
-Are you all right?
-(SHUSHES)

01:28.666 --> 01:30.000
(BAYMAX WHIRRING)

01:34.041 --> 01:36.708
Oh, no. I don't have time for this.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.208
(GRUNTS)

01:42.458 --> 01:43.708
Be cool. Here he comes.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.208
What's happening?

01:46.250 --> 01:49.791
Hello. I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.083
Oh, Baymax.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.166
(IN STRAINED VOICE)
You good?

01:53.250 --> 01:54.625
We're all great down here.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.041
I was alerted to the need
for medical attention

01:57.125 --> 01:59.958
when you said, "Ow, (INHALES SHARPLY)
my ankle."

02:00.333 --> 02:03.291
Who said, "Ow"? I didn't say, "Ow".
Did you say, "Ow"?

02:03.375 --> 02:05.041
-This is nuts.
-BAYMAX: I will scan you now.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.708
-No, no, no.
-Scan complete.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.583
You have sprained your ankle.

02:08.666 --> 02:09.666
(GROANING) Yeah.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.958
My cryo spray will help
keep the swelling down.

02:13.041 --> 02:14.875
(GROANS IN FRUSTRATION)
You don't understand.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.541
I have to run the cafe.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.916
Going back to work
could cause further injury

02:19.000 --> 02:22.041
to the anterior talofibular
ligament in your foot.

02:22.125 --> 02:27.416
I suggest closing the cafe for 5-7 days
to allow your ankle to heal properly.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.625
I'm not closing the Lucky Cat
over a little sprained ankle.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.791
I have customers waiting, as we speak.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.000
What are you downloading?

02:34.833 --> 02:37.958
I am downloading information
on how to run a small business.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.041
And why would you do that?

02:40.125 --> 02:43.125
Your concern over the cafe
is causing you stress,

02:43.208 --> 02:45.625
which can greatly hinder
the healing process.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.958
To help you relax,
I will manage the cafe.

02:49.041 --> 02:52.375
(SCOFFS) You can't just download
what took me years to learn.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.541
BAYMAX: Download complete.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.125
CASS: Baymax, are...

02:56.208 --> 02:58.750
Are you sure you can
run things down there?

02:58.833 --> 03:02.208
My customers are very important to me.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.875
Do not worry about the cafe, Cass.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.125
Everything will be fine.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.583
We are going to need eyes on this, Mochi.

03:11.666 --> 03:12.750
(YAWNS AND MEOWS IN SURPRISE)

03:14.166 --> 03:16.333
Okay, there we go.

03:16.416 --> 03:18.291
-(MEOWS)
-And it works.

03:18.375 --> 03:21.875
(LAUGHS) Hiro's not
the only one with techie skills.

03:21.958 --> 03:22.958
What is that?

03:23.250 --> 03:25.583
What am I looking at?
Is that a...

03:25.666 --> 03:26.750
-Mochi!
-(MEOWS)

03:30.500 --> 03:31.583
CASS: <i>That's it.</i>

03:31.666 --> 03:33.958
<i>That's it. Good boy, Mochi.</i>

03:34.041 --> 03:35.208
<i>What is he doing?</i>

03:35.291 --> 03:36.500
-(MEOWS)
<i>-Wait, wait! No, no, no!</i>

03:36.583 --> 03:38.000
<i>-Go back! Go back!</i>
-(GROWLS AND YOWLS)

03:38.875 --> 03:40.583
<i>Don't play with that.</i>
<i>Mochi! No.</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:42.375
<i>Aw!</i>

03:42.458 --> 03:43.791
(MOCHI SNIFFS AND MEOWS)

03:43.958 --> 03:44.958
(SIGHS)

03:45.041 --> 03:47.125
Well, I guess I'm doing this myself.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.125
(SIGHS)

04:23.166 --> 04:24.166
BAYMAX: Steve.

04:24.625 --> 04:25.625
(STEVE GROANS)

04:26.541 --> 04:27.541
(CASS GRUNTS)

04:27.625 --> 04:30.125
Oh, boy, this is a disaster.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.958
-(GASPS)
-Shh!

04:41.041 --> 04:43.083
-Your banana.
-Thanks, Cass.

04:43.833 --> 04:44.875
Is everything okay?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.083
Oh, yeah. Never better.

04:55.583 --> 04:56.583
Wh...

05:10.375 --> 05:11.375
(CASS GRUNTS)

05:13.166 --> 05:14.166
Hmm?

05:15.708 --> 05:16.708
Hi there.

05:18.375 --> 05:19.375
(GROANS SOFTLY)

05:21.625 --> 05:22.625
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

05:24.333 --> 05:26.166
(GRUNTING IN FRUSTRATION)

05:27.125 --> 05:30.625
Wait, wait...
I just have to get one more thing.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.708
Baymax! Stop.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.708
This is not working.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
BAYMAX: I agree.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.833
You keep coming downstairs.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.750
Not me, you.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.625
You're not giving my customers
the service they need.

05:42.708 --> 05:45.333
I'm sorry. If you won't do it, I will,

05:45.416 --> 05:47.875
and nothing's gonna stop me...

05:50.250 --> 05:51.500
BAYMAX: Oh, no.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.041
(GROANING) Yeah.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.333
(INHALES SHARPLY)

05:57.416 --> 05:58.416
(GROANS)

05:59.125 --> 06:02.250
My objective of running the cafe
to aid in your healing

06:02.333 --> 06:04.833
seems to have caused you
further injury.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.458
Oh, Baymax, this isn't your fault.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.708
I did this to myself.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.458
I should have just
closed the cafe like you said.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.250
It's just...

06:16.333 --> 06:19.583
I made a promise
to take care of this family,

06:19.666 --> 06:24.000
and there is no promise
without those customers.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.458
(SIGHS)

06:26.958 --> 06:29.791
I'm afraid if I don't stay open,
they'll just...

06:30.791 --> 06:32.375
find another place to go.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.041
BAYMAX: They may find other cafes,

06:37.125 --> 06:39.750
but they will not find another Cass.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.750
(CHUCKLES)

06:43.166 --> 06:45.333
Think you can give me a lift downstairs?

06:53.708 --> 06:54.708
(SIGHS)

06:55.416 --> 06:57.541
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Warning. Storage almost full.</i>

06:57.625 --> 07:00.625
-CASS: Hmm?
<i>-Warning. Storage almost full.</i>

07:01.625 --> 07:04.541
Oh, my gosh. Has Mochi been
recording this whole time?

07:09.500 --> 07:10.958
MAN 1: <i>Hey, Mochi.</i>

07:12.958 --> 07:14.000
<i>What you got there?</i>

07:14.291 --> 07:15.375
<i>Some kind of spy cam.</i>

07:15.458 --> 07:16.458
<i>That's Cass's.</i>

07:16.750 --> 07:19.875
<i>Cass, are you using Mochi</i>
<i>to spy on Baymax?</i>

07:19.958 --> 07:22.916
-(GASPS AND CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
-MAN 1: <i>Yeah. She's totally spying on him.</i>

<i>you don't need to worry.</i>

07:25.333 --> 07:28.083
<i>Baymax is slow,</i>
<i>but he's getting the job done.</i>

07:28.166 --> 07:29.791
<i>Your job is to just get better.</i>

07:29.875 --> 07:31.708

(CAT MEOWS)

08:14.708 --> 08:15.833
Hey, Baymax.

08:15.916 --> 08:18.750
Cass said you ran the cafe all day.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.875
BAYMAX: (DISTORTED VOICE)
Coffee. Scones. Expresso. More coffee.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.875
HIRO: Employee of the month.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.125
Way to go, Baymax.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.625
BAYMAX: Refills.
