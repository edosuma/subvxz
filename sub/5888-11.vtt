A few weeks ago, an invisible dome

00:04.463 --> 00:06.374
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.965

and the worst in us.

get inside the dome?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.686
The temperature's dropped
in the last two days.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.729
- You came back.
- How'd the others fare?

00:32.908 --> 00:35.399
Lyle, he didn't come up
out of the water with the rest of us.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.659

we could all die.

you closed the passage.

Only place that cliff leads to
is the bottom of a ravine.

so this high school's a hospital now,
