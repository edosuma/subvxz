02:27.177 --> 02:30.413
<i>Welcome. Welcome to Ireland.</i>

02:30.447 --> 02:32.748
<i>My name's Tony Reilly.</i>

02:32.781 --> 02:34.016
<i>I'm dead.</i>

02:35.252 --> 02:39.955
<i>They say, if an Irishman dies
while he's telling a story,</i>

02:39.989 --> 02:43.726
<i>you can rest assured,
he'll be back.</i>

02:46.363 --> 02:49.765
<i>Once upon a time in Ireland,</i>

02:50.233 --> 02:52.735
<i>there were two farms.</i>

02:54.237 --> 02:59.875
<i>The Muldoon farm where Rosemary
lives with her mother, Aoife,</i>

03:00.343 --> 03:02.811
<i>and her father, Chris,</i>

03:02.845 --> 03:05.881
<i>who was at war with the crows.</i>

03:07.517 --> 03:09.319
<i>And right down the road,</i>

03:09.352 --> 03:14.224
<i>on the sweetest rise of land
you ever saw, was my farm,</i>

03:14.257 --> 03:19.028
<i>where my wife Mary sang
until she conquered the house.</i>

03:19.061 --> 03:23.866
<i>♪ All the flowers
Of the mountain... ♪</i>

03:28.871 --> 03:31.274
<i>And where, upstairs,</i>

03:31.308 --> 03:37.214
<i>my son Anthony asked his
lonely question of the stars.</i>

03:37.247 --> 03:38.814
Mother Nature,

03:39.249 --> 03:40.983
why did you make me so?

03:42.117 --> 03:46.055
<i>The real answer was just
down the road maybe.</i>

03:50.859 --> 03:53.162
<i>Little Rosemary Muldoon.</i>

03:53.195 --> 03:54.531
Anthony.

03:54.564 --> 03:57.766
<i>Besotted with love.</i>

04:14.149 --> 04:15.918
Anthony!

04:18.588 --> 04:20.923
- Fiona!
- Look at your nose.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.025
You look like a clown.

04:32.302 --> 04:33.836
What's this?

04:36.573 --> 04:38.907
Chrissy, Chrissy.

04:39.509 --> 04:41.176
We have a problem.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.581
- <i>Anthony pushed Rosemary down.</i>
- Hmph!

04:44.614 --> 04:49.184
- Why?
- Because Rosemary went after Fiona.

04:52.622 --> 04:55.492
Rosemary? What's the matter?

04:55.525 --> 04:57.560
I have no purpose.

04:57.594 --> 05:01.431
I'm just a girl.
The world is full of girls.

05:01.464 --> 05:04.367
You are not just a girl.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.803
You are a queen.

05:08.305 --> 05:10.139
What kind of queen?

05:11.140 --> 05:13.876
It was my mother's.

05:15.878 --> 05:17.913
It's full of swans.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.353
And you, Rosemary...

05:24.487 --> 05:27.324
for better or for worse,

05:27.357 --> 05:31.293
you are the white swan.

05:33.496 --> 05:37.232
What does it mean
to be the white swan?

05:38.535 --> 05:43.305
Well, it means
no one can stop you.

05:44.239 --> 05:46.975
The world is yours.

05:48.243 --> 05:52.081
You can do anything.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.241
Hyah!

07:00.315 --> 07:02.384
<i>Look at that weather coming.</i>

07:02.419 --> 07:06.955
<i>It reminds me of the night
we buried Chris Muldoon.</i>

07:08.458 --> 07:11.960
<i>Muldoon didn't leave
the Reillys much.</i>

07:11.994 --> 07:15.565
<i>Two gates to open
and a sky full of rain.</i>

07:18.333 --> 07:20.269
You should've
left the gates open.

07:20.302 --> 07:22.639
They're Muldoon gates
and the Muldoons like them shut.

07:22.672 --> 07:25.442
I can't believe you took a widow's ham.
Have you no shame?

07:25.475 --> 07:27.677
- She offered!
- You asked!

07:27.710 --> 07:29.077
Hurry up!

07:29.712 --> 07:32.047
Hurry, is it?
Why don't you get the gate?

07:32.080 --> 07:34.149
It's barely raining.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.511
Get down, Flossie!

08:01.544 --> 08:04.547
Look at you.
You can't even love a dog.

08:06.048 --> 08:07.484
Would you look
at this kitchen?

08:07.517 --> 08:09.619
Your mother would die again

08:09.652 --> 08:11.721
if she saw the state
of this house.

08:11.754 --> 08:13.656
They'll think us tramps.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.658
- How's my face?
- A fright.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.529
- Where's my pipe?
- Upstairs and you're not getting it.

08:20.395 --> 08:22.599
Look at me.
I look like a badger.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.466
I'm freezing.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.369
- Why'd you let the stove go out?
- Would you burn down the house?

08:27.402 --> 08:30.372
You had to invite
the Muldoons over?

08:30.405 --> 08:32.241
The funeral wasn't
enough for you?

08:32.274 --> 08:33.576
Are you that selfish, Daddy?

08:35.745 --> 08:38.615
Jesus.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.115
Would you see the smoke.

08:40.148 --> 08:42.619
I can't believe
Chris Muldoon is dead.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.353
Who's going to kill the crows?

08:44.386 --> 08:47.189
It's true, Chris Muldoon
did like to shoot the crows.

08:47.222 --> 08:50.259
He tore holes in the sky with that gun.

08:50.292 --> 08:52.795
Mam, wait.

08:52.829 --> 08:54.564
Stop.

08:56.331 --> 08:57.634
What's funny?

08:57.667 --> 08:59.167
You all right, Aoife?

08:59.702 --> 09:02.437
All right, is it?
I'm in pieces.

09:03.105 --> 09:04.807
Get the door
afore the night comes in.

09:04.841 --> 09:08.377
Aoife, come. Sit by the heat.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.614
Can't sit all the way down.
My legs lock.

09:14.316 --> 09:16.418
- Were you having a laugh?
- We were.

09:16.451 --> 09:18.287
- We were not.
- What about?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.790
- Will you take a stout?
- In the bottle or the can?

09:20.823 --> 09:22.825
- The bottle.
- No thanks.

09:22.859 --> 09:24.293
The bottle tastes of glass.

09:24.326 --> 09:26.428
Does glass have a taste then?

09:26.461 --> 09:28.230
It does.
Glass tastes like teeth.

09:28.263 --> 09:32.134
Oh, the taste of glass.
Sure, I know it.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.571
- You know the taste of glass?
- I do.

09:34.604 --> 09:36.204
You do not.

09:36.238 --> 09:38.507
So no to the stout.
Well, I'm making some tea.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.577
- You'll have one.
- What's that smoke?

09:40.610 --> 09:42.344
The chimney's crusted shut.

09:42.377 --> 09:43.813
Mine is worse.

09:43.846 --> 09:46.181
I'm working
for every breath.

09:46.214 --> 09:48.585
Look at her.
She'll be dead in a year.

09:48.618 --> 09:51.486
I don't mind.
Except to desert Rosemary

09:51.520 --> 09:54.323
- and leave her orphaned altogether.
- You look fine.

09:54.356 --> 09:59.161
Oh, sure, the fruit still looks
good when the worm starts its work.

09:59.194 --> 10:01.330
And what about you?
When are you packing up?

10:01.363 --> 10:02.799
I'll be dead by Christmas.

10:02.832 --> 10:04.901
Just don't.

10:04.934 --> 10:06.836
- Where's Rosemary?
- Outside.

10:06.869 --> 10:09.171
In the rain?

10:09.204 --> 10:13.275
She won't smoke in front of me and she's
always smokin', so I never see her.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.477
That's her. Stubborn.

10:23.251 --> 10:25.153
She's out there, all right.

10:25.187 --> 10:27.589
- She is. Smokin'.
- She'll catch pneumonia.

10:27.624 --> 10:30.727
Nah, she's crazy.
The cracked ones never get sick.

10:31.426 --> 10:33.428
Crazy? Never noticed that.

10:33.462 --> 10:35.898
That's because you never notice
anything, Anthony.

10:35.932 --> 10:38.835
You're famous across Ireland
for what goes by you.

10:38.868 --> 10:41.303
Famous. As if.

10:41.336 --> 10:45.675
Tony, have you signed
the farm over to Anthony?

10:50.545 --> 10:53.582
What? Just like that
you ask him?

10:53.615 --> 10:55.685
I'm thinking tonight
about arrangements.

10:55.718 --> 10:58.755
- Right.
- Or, are you going to leave it to him?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.389
Who else would he leave it to?

11:00.422 --> 11:01.958
The others have all fled.

11:01.991 --> 11:04.259
I haven't made up me mind.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.698
- You haven't what?
- I would've thought Chris Muldoon would have

11:08.731 --> 11:10.565
you know, made out a plan.

11:10.599 --> 11:12.969
He did. What was his
to leave, he left to me.

11:13.002 --> 11:17.305
- As he should have done.
- It's only arrangements for Rosemary I'm thinking of now.

11:17.339 --> 11:20.409
What do you mean you don't know
if the farm comes to me?

11:20.442 --> 11:21.844
I don't see a clear path.

11:21.878 --> 11:23.278
From where to where?

11:23.311 --> 11:25.280
- From me to you.
- Stop.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.749
It has to be said.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.852
Your face is not right.

11:30.652 --> 11:33.488
You come up
from some other people.

11:33.856 --> 11:35.557
You're more Kelly than Reilly.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.827
It's true,
you're a Kelly in the face.

11:37.860 --> 11:40.429
- In my face?
- He likes to fish.

11:40.462 --> 11:42.865
That's the Kellys.
It's well known.

11:42.899 --> 11:45.802
John Kelly
thought he was a fish.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.005
- My name is Reilly. I'm a Reilly.
- No, you're a Kelly!

11:49.038 --> 11:53.876
You take after John Kelly and
that man was mad as the full moon.

11:53.910 --> 11:55.377
Drowned himself!

11:55.878 --> 11:57.747
- In the Royal Canal.
- He fell in.

11:57.780 --> 12:01.349
- He had a rock tied to his neck.
- I'm not a Kelly!

12:01.383 --> 12:03.853
You're not a farmer,
that's what you're not.

12:03.886 --> 12:05.320
Now, Tony.

12:05.353 --> 12:07.023
You don't stand on the land

12:07.056 --> 12:08.725
and draw strength from it.

12:08.758 --> 12:12.227
As I did. Till Mammy died.

12:13.029 --> 12:15.898
You'd rather read
your goddamn magazines.

12:15.932 --> 12:18.266
Easy now.

12:19.769 --> 12:22.437
Don't criticize me, Daddy.

12:22.471 --> 12:25.440
Some of us don't have joy,
but we do what we must.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.577
Is a man who does what he must
but feels no pleasure

12:28.610 --> 12:30.813
less of a man
than one who's happy?

12:32.915 --> 12:34.616
That's it.

12:34.984 --> 12:36.953
If only for want
of better company,

12:36.986 --> 12:38.687
I'm getting Rosemary.

12:39.387 --> 12:41.656
Anthony, Anthony.

13:06.548 --> 13:07.749
Rosemary.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.052
Anthony.

13:10.086 --> 13:12.554
What are you doing out here
away from the house?

13:13.755 --> 13:14.991
Smoking.

13:15.024 --> 13:16.625
In the rain?

13:18.727 --> 13:20.395
There's a bit of roof.

13:20.963 --> 13:23.298
It's dark as tar.

13:24.801 --> 13:26.869
I can see.

13:30.372 --> 13:32.374
You're smoking a pipe now?

13:35.577 --> 13:36.711
It's Da's.

13:40.549 --> 13:43.685
That bull of yours
is coughing like pertussis.

13:44.386 --> 13:46.488
I dosed him for worms.
He's coughing them up.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.090
Doesn't sound good.

13:48.124 --> 13:49.658
Don't say it.

14:02.038 --> 14:03.705
How long
since you dosed him?

14:03.738 --> 14:06.108
Three weeks.
His lungs should've cleared.

14:06.142 --> 14:08.110
I don't know.
Should I call the vet?

14:08.144 --> 14:10.712
The morning's soon enough
to spend money.

14:11.613 --> 14:14.349
Go in, you'll catch your death.
No.

14:15.584 --> 14:16.886
Have you heard from Fiona?

14:18.020 --> 14:19.521
Never.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.023
Not since our childhood days.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.993
- Do you know where she is?
- She's in Wicklow.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.794
With a husband
and three daughters.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.730
He thinks we're talking about him.

14:28.763 --> 14:32.001
Well, men always think
the subject's number one.

14:35.804 --> 14:38.875
Are you seriously
begrudging Anthony the farm?

14:38.908 --> 14:42.912
I gave him his mother's ring
three years since.

14:42.945 --> 14:46.615
He's done nothing with it.
He's a bachelor to the bone.

14:46.648 --> 14:51.486
- You're going the wrong way.
- This is my family's farm 121 years.

14:51.519 --> 14:53.521
It won't stop with Anthony.

14:53.555 --> 14:56.791
Things end
when God says they do.

14:59.694 --> 15:01.130
Aoife. Aoife.

15:01.163 --> 15:02.965
I can't believe
my Chrissy's gone.

15:02.999 --> 15:05.634
Aoife. Oh.

15:05.667 --> 15:06.768
Oh, Aoife.

15:06.801 --> 15:08.837
Half my house is gone.

15:09.604 --> 15:10.940
Aoife.

15:14.476 --> 15:16.045
What's Flossie about?

15:16.611 --> 15:18.080
She's after the ham.

15:18.114 --> 15:19.547
She can't get it.

15:19.949 --> 15:21.583
It's in the fridge.

15:22.952 --> 15:24.053
Would you have a piece?

15:24.086 --> 15:25.487
If you want ham,
have it!

15:25.520 --> 15:27.756
Don't be offering me
me own ham!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.763
Listen, I'm so sorry
about your da.

15:35.264 --> 15:36.999
Thank you, Anthony.

15:41.971 --> 15:44.006
Jesus. When my mother died,

15:44.040 --> 15:46.042
I couldn't see colors anymore.

15:47.575 --> 15:49.744
Where do we go when we die?

15:49.778 --> 15:51.047
The sky?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.148
The ground.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.648
Then what's the sky for?

15:53.682 --> 15:56.718
It's for now.
The sky is for now.

16:05.227 --> 16:07.163
You know, it was me
that found him.

16:07.964 --> 16:12.034
Mam came up. Her face was white as
snow, so I gave her water.

16:12.969 --> 16:15.503
But didn't the glass
have his teeth in it.

16:15.537 --> 16:18.074
- No!
- She was wild.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.874
She won't drink
from a glass since.

16:19.908 --> 16:21.576
I can testify to that.

16:21.609 --> 16:23.878
- Says it tastes like teeth.
- Tastes like teeth.

16:31.753 --> 16:36.491
Well, I'll get her. She won't sit
anywhere but her own chair, so...

16:37.026 --> 16:38.094
we should go.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.161
Right.

16:39.761 --> 16:41.163
And you'd let me go,
wouldn't ya?

16:41.963 --> 16:44.166
- Well, you said you were going.
- Don't you know better

16:44.200 --> 16:45.867
than to listen to people?
Who is that?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.569
It's Bad News Cleary.

16:47.602 --> 16:48.870
Why do you call him that?

16:48.903 --> 16:50.605
Because he only
brings bad news.

16:50.638 --> 16:53.608
Hello, Rosemary.
Sorry for your trouble.

16:53.641 --> 16:56.811
Listen, that horse of yours
has jumped the fence again.

16:56.845 --> 16:58.147
Don't say it.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.216
Yeah. I thought
you'd want to know.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.084
Yeah,
thank you, Cleary.

17:02.118 --> 17:04.586
You should go inside to see her mother.
She's in there.

17:04.619 --> 17:06.222
I will not! Good night.

17:07.056 --> 17:10.159
You see? Bad News Cleary.
Do you have a halter?

17:10.192 --> 17:12.061
- I do.
- You'd best give it here.

17:12.094 --> 17:13.561
What about your mother?

17:13.595 --> 17:15.164
Would you take her home?

17:15.197 --> 17:16.865
I don't mind.
Thank you.

17:16.898 --> 17:19.035
<i>You're sure
you don't want some ham?</i>

17:19.068 --> 17:20.169
Cut a piece for the dog.

17:20.202 --> 17:22.071
No, it's too good for her.

17:22.104 --> 17:23.705
It's too good
for either of you.

17:30.212 --> 17:32.013
Should we speak of it?

17:32.348 --> 17:33.648
What?

17:34.283 --> 17:37.819
There was no point
while Chris was alive.

17:38.254 --> 17:40.021
Are you proposing?

17:40.056 --> 17:42.757
What? Jesus, no.

17:42.791 --> 17:47.796
Then get off your duff and say
what you mean, you gobshite fraud.

17:48.930 --> 17:52.667
That piece of land that
blocks me from the road,

17:52.700 --> 17:53.835
sell it back to me.

17:53.868 --> 17:55.637
You only have to open the gates.

17:55.670 --> 17:58.640
Have you gotten
out of my car in the rain

17:58.673 --> 18:01.243
and drowned yourself
working those damn gates?

18:01.277 --> 18:03.079
It rains on us all.

18:03.112 --> 18:04.679
I'll give you a fair price.

18:04.712 --> 18:07.216
Did your broach this with Chrissy?
I did.

18:07.249 --> 18:08.983
No reply.

18:09.017 --> 18:11.653
No reply is a reply.

18:11.686 --> 18:14.622
I need to pass the farm down
as it was given me.

18:14.656 --> 18:16.092
So you're
passing it down now?

18:16.125 --> 18:19.627
I was always passing it down.
To Anthony.

18:19.661 --> 18:21.696
Rosemary asked me
to take you home.

18:21.729 --> 18:23.832
Where is she?
Her horse got loose again.

18:23.865 --> 18:26.968
That horse is Satan
on four feet!

18:27.001 --> 18:29.105
Think on what I said.

18:29.138 --> 18:30.705
I won't.
Why not?

18:30.738 --> 18:33.775
You don't need me
concerning those gates.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.977
- You need Rosemary.
- Why's that?

18:36.010 --> 18:37.912
The frontage Chrissy
bought from you,

18:37.946 --> 18:39.381
I do not own.

18:39.415 --> 18:41.983
All the rest is mine,
but not that.

18:42.016 --> 18:43.385
He sold it?

18:43.419 --> 18:46.054
He gave it to Rosemary.

18:46.087 --> 18:47.189
Rosemary?

18:47.223 --> 18:49.023
What are you saying?

18:49.057 --> 18:51.793
Chris Muldoon signed
that strip of dirt

18:51.826 --> 18:54.130
between the gates
over to Rosemary

18:54.163 --> 18:57.433
when she was not more
than ten years of age.

18:57.466 --> 19:00.336
He gave a ten-year-old girl
my right of way?

19:00.369 --> 19:02.737
She'd have it
and I can tell you why.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.407
It was the spot where
Anthony pushed her down.

19:05.441 --> 19:08.109
Me?
You pushed a little girl?

19:08.144 --> 19:09.378
I did not. When?

19:09.411 --> 19:11.413
When she was ten!
You did it!

19:11.447 --> 19:14.015
And you're banished
from that spot.

19:14.048 --> 19:18.786
Now take me home before
me pacemaker runs down to zero.

19:19.854 --> 19:24.759
Bye, bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

19:27.363 --> 19:28.930
Bye.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.457
Good boy, Blister.

19:55.491 --> 19:57.959
Oh, such a good boy.

19:58.860 --> 20:02.163
You're so beautiful.
You stay right there.

20:03.097 --> 20:04.866
All right.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.269
All right.

20:07.303 --> 20:08.870
It's okay, my love.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.739
May you burn in hell,

20:11.773 --> 20:13.942
you shite horse!

20:22.251 --> 20:24.220
There's a good boy.

20:35.029 --> 20:38.866
Okay. Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.004
Anthony!

21:25.447 --> 21:26.981
Are you all right?

21:27.015 --> 21:30.018
I'm fine.
What were you doing out there?

21:30.051 --> 21:32.421
Fishing.
That was fishing?

21:32.454 --> 21:35.089
Yeah.
Without a rod?

21:36.057 --> 21:37.559
Who were you talking to?
I wasn't talking.

21:37.593 --> 21:40.094
You looked to be talking,
then swatting, then you jumped in.

21:40.128 --> 21:42.897
I did not. It's the Kellys
that jump in. I'm a Reilly.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.033
- You're a Reilly.
- What are you doing down by the river?

21:45.066 --> 21:46.968
What I've been doing.
After this one.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.871
- You're not still from the night before?
- I am.

21:49.904 --> 21:51.839
Well, God in heaven!
You look the worse for it.

21:51.873 --> 21:54.343
Well, thanks much.
You don't look perfect yourself.

21:57.346 --> 22:00.316
You have some fine-looking
cattle this year, Anthony.

22:00.349 --> 22:03.918
Not too bad. Why does your
horse keep jumping the fence?

22:03.951 --> 22:05.253
He's restless.

22:05.286 --> 22:07.323
I know that one.
Do ya?

22:07.356 --> 22:10.058
I hear a voice sometimes
when I'm out here,

22:10.091 --> 22:12.060
and the voice says, "Go."

22:12.093 --> 22:12.994
Go?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.596
Do you not love the farm?

22:14.630 --> 22:17.198
Love? Sure hate it
for a prison.

22:17.231 --> 22:20.835
Came up out of it like a tree
and here I am with it around me.

22:21.637 --> 22:24.205
Why don't you leave
and follow the voice?

22:24.238 --> 22:26.442
- No.
- Why no?

22:31.647 --> 22:33.848
There's
these green fields...

22:35.249 --> 22:37.885
and the animals
living off them.

22:39.621 --> 22:41.289
And over that there's us...

22:42.323 --> 22:43.257
living off the animals.

22:46.094 --> 22:48.397
And over that there's
that which tends to us...

22:49.531 --> 22:51.299
and lives off us maybe.

22:53.267 --> 22:54.902
Whatever that is...

22:56.270 --> 22:58.039
it holds me here.

23:01.175 --> 23:02.243
You should go.

23:03.679 --> 23:06.114
Once you're on your own
you should sell the farm,

23:06.147 --> 23:08.182
leave Ireland entirely.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.084
Why?

23:10.118 --> 23:12.454
It's a terrible place
for a decent person.

23:12.488 --> 23:14.456
Are you not decent?

23:14.490 --> 23:16.057
Me?

23:16.458 --> 23:18.092
I'm mad.

23:20.729 --> 23:24.132
You could walk us home.
I can't be leaving the boat.

23:24.165 --> 23:25.967
I'll see you at church.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.003
You were talking out there.
See you at church.

23:32.474 --> 23:34.976
"There's the green fields,

23:35.009 --> 23:37.145
and the animals
living off them..."

23:39.013 --> 23:42.216
When he says
those things, Blister,

23:43.050 --> 23:46.187
I know I must have him,
God help me.

24:45.714 --> 24:47.783
- What's that?
- Stew.

24:47.816 --> 24:50.619
- You were a while.
- Stopped at church.

24:50.652 --> 24:52.053
Have you taken it up?

24:52.086 --> 24:55.356
It's no business of yours.

24:55.389 --> 24:57.493
Want stew?
I would.

25:16.545 --> 25:17.779
Are you
not going to open it?

25:17.813 --> 25:20.381
- What?
- The letter from America.

25:20.414 --> 25:24.520
- I'll get to it.
- You'll get to it?

25:24.553 --> 25:27.523
How often do you get a letter from
your nephew and you'll get to it?

25:27.556 --> 25:29.490
Me glasses are upstairs.

25:29.525 --> 25:30.826
I'll get them.

25:30.859 --> 25:33.294
I'll read it when I'm alone.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.197
What's in it?

25:36.230 --> 25:39.066
How would I know?
I haven't read it.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.170
What's in it?

25:48.109 --> 25:49.510
You can't!

25:50.244 --> 25:53.180
Fine! Then get a wife!

25:59.555 --> 26:01.055
Rosemary...

26:02.123 --> 26:04.358
it seems like
maybe we should...

26:08.830 --> 26:10.331
we should ma...

26:12.466 --> 26:14.335
we should marry.

26:17.673 --> 26:19.273
Rosemary...

26:20.842 --> 26:22.578
we're known to each other

26:23.679 --> 26:25.246
quite a while now.

26:27.348 --> 26:29.383
No doubt you could do better,
but...

26:30.919 --> 26:33.354
Well, you don't seem
to be doing much, so...

26:34.590 --> 26:36.090
will you have me?

26:38.894 --> 26:41.162
Damn it, is that
not enough for you?

26:42.831 --> 26:47.501
All right, seems like you won't
be satisfied until I'm on my knee.

26:51.505 --> 26:52.774
Would you marry me?

26:54.408 --> 26:57.211
So it's true.
You have the Kelly madness.

26:57.244 --> 26:59.513
- Cleary!
- I thought Tony was having me on.

26:59.547 --> 27:03.217
- What are you lurking?
- Your da's selling the farm from under ya.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.853
I thought you'd want to know.

27:04.886 --> 27:07.588
So you've taken up
with a donkey?

27:13.929 --> 27:15.529
Watch out!

27:17.231 --> 27:20.134
I didn't know Cleary
could run like that.

27:20.736 --> 27:22.570
Tony, you bastard!

27:24.572 --> 27:27.208
- What?
- He's selling the farm to Adam.

27:27.241 --> 27:29.176
Well, then go and face
the old fool down!

27:29.210 --> 27:31.245
- I don't like a fight.
- Well, who does?

27:31.278 --> 27:33.381
- Half of Ireland, just not me.
- I'll go.

27:33.414 --> 27:35.684
- You will not! Rosemary!
- What?

27:36.550 --> 27:39.220
Nothing. Nothing.

27:39.821 --> 27:41.255
Leave it!

27:42.523 --> 27:45.359
What's he on about?
I hope you have no part in this, Mother.

27:48.496 --> 27:51.733
Tony means to sell the farm
to his brother's son.

27:51.767 --> 27:54.301
Adam? In America?
Yeah.

27:54.335 --> 27:56.637
That's why he wants
the land back.

27:57.471 --> 27:59.675
The Yank doesn't want to be
bothering with gates.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.342
Oh, he'll be...

28:01.943 --> 28:03.812
He'll be bothering.

28:03.845 --> 28:05.947
There's much
of your father in you.

28:05.981 --> 28:08.315
Proud to know it.

28:08.349 --> 28:12.319
Two bulldogs.
No, I'm a swan.

28:13.889 --> 28:16.725
Why would you think
of denying Anthony?

28:17.458 --> 28:19.393
- Leave it.
- Well, if you want to talk to me

28:19.427 --> 28:21.963
about these gates,
you'll talk to me about Anthony.

28:21.997 --> 28:24.298
What there is to say,
I won't say.

28:24.331 --> 28:26.802
You've kept him down
with the promise of this farm.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.302
Not a word of truth.

28:28.335 --> 28:30.438
Don't cross me, Tony Reilly.

28:30.471 --> 28:32.708
- Are you in love with Anthony?
- It's more than love.

28:32.741 --> 28:35.844
Don't be. Now go while
your damn gates are open.

28:35.877 --> 28:38.345
I'm not done with you!

28:39.313 --> 28:41.382
- He's not normal!
- I don't care!

28:41.415 --> 28:43.451
He'll never marry.
Well, then neither will I,

28:43.484 --> 28:45.887
and he will be in his house
and I'll be in mine.

28:45.921 --> 28:47.321
Rosemary!

28:47.354 --> 28:49.991
Be quick! I need to pee!

28:50.025 --> 28:51.860
And you'd sell to a Yank,
would ya?

28:51.893 --> 28:53.661
He's a Reilly!
He's a Yank!

28:53.694 --> 28:54.863
You're trespassing now!

28:54.896 --> 28:56.998
Drop this plot
or I'll kill ya!

28:57.032 --> 28:59.300
Would you have the place
go in auction?

28:59.333 --> 29:01.737
Anthony will never marry.
Oh, he will.

29:01.770 --> 29:04.005
Wake up!
Look to yourself.

29:04.039 --> 29:07.241
If it comes to that,
I'll freeze my eggs!

29:08.342 --> 29:10.979
- You'll what?
- I'll freeze my eggs.

29:11.012 --> 29:12.613
If he's slow, I'll wait.

29:12.646 --> 29:14.482
You should freeze
your whole body

29:14.515 --> 29:15.951
if you're waiting
for that one!

29:15.984 --> 29:17.618
I believe he will come to me.

29:17.651 --> 29:18.954
I need this settled.

29:18.987 --> 29:21.589
I'm turning 75.
Listen.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.926
The farm goes to Anthony.
Just say it.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.527
I can't.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.829
Rose!

29:28.830 --> 29:31.365
Take notice.
We're not done, sir.

29:32.067 --> 29:33.634
We're not done!

29:35.402 --> 29:37.304
How will we be done?

29:38.339 --> 29:40.407
I need these gates down.

30:42.003 --> 30:45.472
<i>It's high summer and
the honey flows at its height.</i>

30:46.807 --> 30:51.445
<i>Their wing beats fan the hive
to keep it cool and ventilated.</i>

30:52.613 --> 30:56.617
<i>They've swept gently after
their queen into their new home.</i>

30:56.650 --> 30:57.685
Tony.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.454
You're right.

31:01.422 --> 31:02.690
I'll never marry.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.895
It's your land.
You do what you like.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.064
I'll manage.

31:10.031 --> 31:13.467
<i>Smoking the bees
helps to pacify the hive.</i>

31:21.442 --> 31:22.911
Fancy that.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.751
Mam! Jesus!
You're trying to kill me.

31:30.784 --> 31:33.520
Never mind that.
Guess whose car I saw

31:33.554 --> 31:34.990
parked at the church
on a weekday.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.925
Whose?
Tony Reilly.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.860
Was there a funeral?
He had the parking lot to himself.

31:39.895 --> 31:41.695
I don't believe it.

31:41.729 --> 31:46.167
Why would a heathen man like Tony
Reilly be kneeling in a church?

31:46.201 --> 31:48.904
He knows he's wrong.
He knows he's wrong.

31:50.804 --> 31:52.406
Hmm.

32:04.518 --> 32:05.954
How you doing, laddie?

32:07.989 --> 32:09.090
Perfect.

32:09.124 --> 32:11.126
What's the drink?
Uh...

32:12.060 --> 32:15.629
Don't really know.
It's called an orange blossom.

32:16.031 --> 32:17.564
I'd have one.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.135
Well, you presume,
don't ya?

32:20.168 --> 32:24.505
That's right.
It's Saturday night and I do presume.

32:25.673 --> 32:27.108
Cheers.

32:36.151 --> 32:37.751
Where's Anthony?

32:37.785 --> 32:39.054
Killala.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.487
Why'd he go to Killala?

32:40.521 --> 32:43.224
Why does anybody
go to Killala?

32:43.258 --> 32:46.094
I wish Mary was here.
She loved a tune.

32:46.127 --> 32:47.561
She did.

32:47.594 --> 32:49.097
What do you think
she'd think of you

32:49.130 --> 32:50.898
selling the farm away
from Anthony?

32:50.931 --> 32:52.133
I can't think about it.

32:52.167 --> 32:54.102
That's the question,
isn't it?

32:54.135 --> 32:57.871
What would Mary Kelly say to see the
farm just taken from her only son?

32:57.905 --> 32:59.840
Because he was a Kelly.

32:59.873 --> 33:01.176
Like herself.

33:01.209 --> 33:04.511
I came out to eat a meal,
hear some singing.

33:04.545 --> 33:05.879
Leave off.

33:08.183 --> 33:10.517
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

33:11.286 --> 33:14.255
And now we'll hear one
from a local beauty.

33:14.289 --> 33:16.091
Rosemary Muldoon.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.624
Wish me luck.

33:17.658 --> 33:18.959
What's she doing?

33:18.994 --> 33:20.861
She's going to sing.

33:22.763 --> 33:25.799
My neighbor, Mary Reilly,

33:26.567 --> 33:28.136
may she rest easy
in heaven,

33:28.169 --> 33:29.970
she sang this song
into the ground,

33:30.005 --> 33:35.709
and when she passed it was like
the birds lost their voices.

33:35.743 --> 33:38.046
So I'll sing it now
to remember her.

33:41.182 --> 33:46.287

35:40.901 --> 35:43.003
I'm only trying
to do what's right.

35:43.036 --> 35:44.972
For who?
The farm.

35:45.005 --> 35:48.909
The farm doesn't know a thing
about right and it won't know.

35:51.312 --> 35:55.082
Do you know why my husband went
to war with the crows, Tony?

35:55.849 --> 35:57.818
He was shaking his fist.

35:59.019 --> 36:00.854
We'd lost a child.

36:01.922 --> 36:02.990
A boy.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.926
And he was shaking his fist.

36:06.793 --> 36:09.430
You have your children
and you've had your life.

36:09.464 --> 36:12.200
Do you want more
than that from God?

36:23.444 --> 36:25.313
What time is it?

36:25.346 --> 36:27.714
It's so late, it's early.

36:27.748 --> 36:29.217
Where now?

36:29.917 --> 36:32.220
- The cemetery.
- Perfect.

36:39.394 --> 36:42.162
How high do you think
that wall is?

36:55.243 --> 36:56.944
What's your name again?

36:57.512 --> 36:58.812
Anthony.

36:58.845 --> 37:00.814
Anthony, we are strangers.

37:01.216 --> 37:02.483
That we are.

37:02.517 --> 37:04.818
We'll never see
each other again.

37:04.851 --> 37:07.187
No, we will not, no.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.057
So I'll tell you
my worst secret.

37:10.090 --> 37:11.359
Please do.

37:11.392 --> 37:13.461
I've slept with a priest.

37:13.494 --> 37:15.762
- No!
- I have.

37:16.129 --> 37:17.365
Twice.

37:17.398 --> 37:18.533
Shocking!

37:18.566 --> 37:20.734
In my mother's bed.

37:21.502 --> 37:22.936
Worse and worse.

37:23.471 --> 37:26.139
- I'm a disgrace.
- You are.

37:27.542 --> 37:29.244
But I can top it.

37:29.277 --> 37:30.744
What do you got?

37:36.417 --> 37:40.887
I have a tiny...
tininess in my brain.

37:42.022 --> 37:43.824
A tininess?

37:55.403 --> 37:58.306
Yikes.

38:07.914 --> 38:09.182
Here he is now.

38:11.852 --> 38:13.153
Hello, Anthony.

38:13.186 --> 38:15.155
Welcome to Ireland.
You remember Adam?

38:15.188 --> 38:16.923
Of course.
Nice to see you, Anthony.

38:16.957 --> 38:18.593
Welcome to Ireland.
Thanks.

38:18.626 --> 38:21.562
- How's New York?
- Terrific. You've got to come.

38:21.596 --> 38:25.232
Yeah. Right, yeah.
Let's get you aboard.

38:25.265 --> 38:28.135
Could you go ahead and take my dad?
I'm going to rent a car.

38:29.102 --> 38:30.438
Okay.

38:30.471 --> 38:32.507
Great, I'll see you
there, Pop, thanks.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.509
Ah! It's good to be home.

38:34.542 --> 38:36.943
Yeah, it's grand you came
for his birthday.

38:36.977 --> 38:40.947
- Wouldn't have missed it. 75 years old?
- That's right, yeah.

38:45.420 --> 38:48.989
- Still doing with the two gates?
- We are.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.825
- Why?
- History.

38:52.593 --> 38:54.861
There's a lot of history
in Ireland.

38:56.364 --> 38:58.399
- Who's this now?
- Tony!

38:58.433 --> 39:02.403
- Welcome! It's pissing rain.
- Good day for the ducks.

39:02.437 --> 39:04.372
- Where's Adam?
- He'll be along.

39:04.405 --> 39:07.174
- He's renting a car.
- An automatic, I'll wager.

39:07.207 --> 39:08.476
If he can get one.

39:08.509 --> 39:10.110
Is it that much
to shift the gears?

39:10.143 --> 39:11.446
How's Aoife?

39:11.479 --> 39:12.580
She's falling apart.

39:12.613 --> 39:13.880
Her heart.

39:13.914 --> 39:16.216
And her legs
and lungs.

39:16.249 --> 39:17.485
Blind in one eye.

39:18.519 --> 39:21.356
Are they coming to the party?
They'll come.

39:23.256 --> 39:25.225
Happy birthday.

39:25.258 --> 39:27.994
There's nothing
left of Johnny O'Brien

39:28.028 --> 39:29.963
worth calling
Johnny O'Brien.

39:29.996 --> 39:34.535
First, half his herd was cut
across with tuberculosis.

39:34.569 --> 39:36.136
Cut across with it.

39:36.571 --> 39:38.271
Then he tried
to kill himself,

39:38.305 --> 39:40.641
but the gun only
took off his lip.

39:40.675 --> 39:45.278
It left him smiling all the time.
You wouldn't like to look at him.

39:45.312 --> 39:47.648
Cleary, would you leave off?
You're scaring the children.

39:47.682 --> 39:50.984
What's wrong with a little scare between friends?

39:51.017 --> 39:52.653
Right, lads?

39:52.687 --> 39:54.422
Mother of Christ.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.090
Would you look at this.

40:04.499 --> 40:05.700
What do you think?

40:05.733 --> 40:07.468
Would you see this.

40:07.502 --> 40:08.935
Is it an automatic?

40:08.969 --> 40:12.005
Anthony,
that is a Rolls-Royce.

40:12.038 --> 40:13.441
A Rolls-Royce.

40:14.241 --> 40:16.977
Can you believe the sound
of the words, Da? A Rolls-Royce.

40:17.010 --> 40:20.213
It's the finest car
I've ever seen.

40:22.349 --> 40:25.620
And that's how Anthony Reilly
fell in love with a donkey.

40:32.527 --> 40:33.661
Anthony.

40:33.694 --> 40:35.362
Got you
a little something.

40:35.395 --> 40:38.965
What do you mean?
It's Tony's birthday, not mine.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.934
What is it?
Open it.

40:46.339 --> 40:49.577
- Huh?
- I am looking at it and I still don't know what it is.

40:49.610 --> 40:51.077
Come on.

40:52.279 --> 40:55.248
- It's a raincoat!
- It's white.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.485
It's a white raincoat.

41:07.762 --> 41:09.162
Hi.

41:10.498 --> 41:11.499
How are you?

41:12.467 --> 41:15.101
I'm Tony's nephew, Adam.
Yeah, I know who are.

41:15.135 --> 41:17.572
Rosemary Muldoon.
Yeah, I know who you are, too.

41:18.271 --> 41:20.608
- You're on the next farm.
- I am.

41:21.642 --> 41:24.077
And you own that little piece
of land between those gates.

41:24.110 --> 41:27.515
- I do.
- And you're going to sell it to me.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.250
To who? You?
That's right.

41:30.283 --> 41:32.487
You're a little
confrontational.

41:33.554 --> 41:35.523
- Do you think so?
- I do.

41:37.257 --> 41:38.559
Too much so?

41:40.661 --> 41:42.229
I don't know.

41:46.166 --> 41:49.002
Look in my eyes
and ask me again.

41:52.773 --> 41:54.474
Are you going
to sell me that land?

41:56.544 --> 41:57.712
That was strong.

41:57.745 --> 41:59.179
Hmm.

42:00.146 --> 42:02.550
I don't know.
I might sell it, I might not.

42:02.583 --> 42:04.417
I'm all aflutter.

42:09.824 --> 42:12.593
Jesus.
What's he doing?

42:12.627 --> 42:15.596
He got himself a metal detector.

42:16.731 --> 42:18.833
Huh. Did he lose something?

42:18.866 --> 42:20.500
No, he's just shy.

42:21.434 --> 42:23.436
I guess that's one word for it.

42:24.437 --> 42:27.173
I'm sorry to hear
your mom's not feeling well.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.577
It's nice you came
for the birthday.

42:30.410 --> 42:33.413
Yeah. I wish I could stay
a little longer.

42:34.849 --> 42:38.285
I have to get back.
That's too bad.

42:38.318 --> 42:40.220
You should come to New York.

42:40.253 --> 42:42.489
What would I do
in New York?

42:42.522 --> 42:44.291
I could take you
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

42:44.324 --> 42:47.294
I don't want
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

42:47.327 --> 42:49.329
And anyways,
who would see to my farm?

42:49.362 --> 42:52.332
You run that by yourself?
Yeah, I do.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.068
How many acres do you have?

42:55.670 --> 42:56.804
I don't know.

42:57.537 --> 42:59.339
How do you not know
how many acres of land...

42:59.372 --> 43:01.474
Because it's just a number.

43:01.508 --> 43:04.144
I'm all about numbers.
I manage money for a living.

43:04.177 --> 43:06.313
Oh, does money need you
to manage it?

43:09.149 --> 43:10.517
I'm not sure.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.354
You seem set.

43:15.756 --> 43:17.457
Waiting for that one?

43:18.759 --> 43:19.860
I don't know.

43:19.894 --> 43:21.394
Hmm.

43:22.597 --> 43:24.197
I don't know.

43:24.230 --> 43:26.299
What are you
waiting for?

43:28.936 --> 43:30.503
Me, I don't wait.

43:30.905 --> 43:33.239
Well, I do like that.

43:34.374 --> 43:35.876
You should come
to New York sometime.

43:35.910 --> 43:37.444
I don't want
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

43:37.477 --> 43:39.579
What do you want to see?
The ballet.

43:41.214 --> 43:43.550
Hmm. Wouldn't have guessed that.

43:43.583 --> 43:45.318
Never been to one.

43:50.691 --> 43:53.226
I've heard he's
fallen in love with a donkey.

43:53.259 --> 43:54.762
Well, you heard wrong!

43:55.395 --> 43:57.464
I'm sorry.
I don't understand you people.

43:57.497 --> 44:00.868
You just seem to accept
these crazy things,

44:00.901 --> 44:04.204
like that gate situation and...

44:04.237 --> 44:05.605
And what?

44:05.940 --> 44:07.607
Loneliness.

44:08.809 --> 44:11.378
- Is that your car?
- I rented it.

44:11.411 --> 44:13.648
Why'd you bring
such a fine car to a farm?

44:14.414 --> 44:17.317
- For show.
- Yeah, I don't understand that.

44:26.226 --> 44:27.695
Have you eaten?

44:28.763 --> 44:29.930
No.

44:29.964 --> 44:31.666
Steer clear
of the pudding.

44:31.699 --> 44:33.466
I think it's off.

44:35.235 --> 44:38.438
You know what?
I know it's off.

44:46.413 --> 44:49.549
An Irish picnic.
What kind of madness is this?

44:49.582 --> 44:51.686
We've done it
for the Americans.

44:51.719 --> 44:53.954
The Yanks thought it would
be nice to have a picnic.

44:53.988 --> 44:56.589
- Lord love them.
- Happy birthday, Tony.

44:56.623 --> 44:57.825
Mammy sends her love.

44:57.858 --> 44:59.860
Tell her to feel better.
I will.

44:59.894 --> 45:01.594
You going?
I am.

45:07.367 --> 45:08.969
How's Rosemary's mother?

45:09.003 --> 45:10.871
She's in a bad way.

45:10.905 --> 45:13.741
- How bad?
- Bad.

45:27.554 --> 45:29.289
What kind of cows
are these?

45:29.322 --> 45:31.491
They're called Charolais.
Away, lads. Go on.

45:35.628 --> 45:36.997
What are you doing?

45:37.031 --> 45:38.631
Picking mushrooms.

45:39.867 --> 45:41.936
Are they okay to eat?

45:41.969 --> 45:43.470
Yeah.

45:44.004 --> 45:45.873
It's a grand thing to do
with children.

45:45.906 --> 45:47.674
- Pick mushrooms.
- Hmm.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.244
What a beautiful spot.

45:51.912 --> 45:53.580
Yep.

45:54.547 --> 45:56.516
That one looks
a little freaked out.

45:57.684 --> 46:00.755
It's the coat.
He doesn't recognize me in the coat.

46:00.788 --> 46:02.522
They're hungry, though.

46:05.658 --> 46:06.726
Come on now.

46:13.100 --> 46:15.069
So how many acres
do you have exactly?

46:15.102 --> 46:16.703
I don't know.

46:17.537 --> 46:20.040
How does nobody know
how many acres they have?

46:20.074 --> 46:22.275
We're not a direct people,
you know.

46:23.043 --> 46:25.378
Do you want to be
a farmer then?

46:25.411 --> 46:27.580
Yeah.
No, you don't.

46:28.048 --> 46:30.050
You want to own a farm.
It's not the same.

46:30.084 --> 46:31.751
I could be a farmer.

46:31.786 --> 46:33.286
Wake up.

46:33.753 --> 46:35.522
You're no farmer.

46:35.555 --> 46:36.924
It would be a bloody farce.

46:39.759 --> 46:42.362
Maybe you've been
a farmer too long.

46:43.030 --> 46:44.531
How's that?

46:48.102 --> 46:50.436
You been talking to Cleary?
What did he say?

46:50.470 --> 46:53.506
Something about
you and a donkey.

46:55.575 --> 46:57.443
I'm going to kill
that man one day.

46:57.477 --> 46:59.679
The world will
thank me for it.

47:46.093 --> 47:48.361
I can't sell you the farm.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.767
Listen, Tony.

47:56.769 --> 47:58.538
Even if I have to put up
with the gates,

47:58.571 --> 48:00.540
I'm still interested.
No.

48:01.008 --> 48:02.910
God would fault me.

48:04.544 --> 48:06.412
Is it those two?

48:06.446 --> 48:08.148
I don't know what
they're going to do,

48:08.182 --> 48:11.684
but I can't be the reason
they're apart.

48:33.073 --> 48:35.541
Lord, help me.

48:39.046 --> 48:41.481
Oh, help me.

48:49.957 --> 48:51.557
<i>I was there</i>

48:51.591 --> 48:53.760
<i>on Aoife's wedding day.</i>

48:54.962 --> 48:57.864
<i>I never saw a lovelier bride.</i>

49:28.628 --> 49:29.929
Anthony.

49:30.965 --> 49:32.465
Anthony!

49:33.100 --> 49:34.600
You all right?

49:36.103 --> 49:37.670
Bring me my pipe.

49:38.205 --> 49:39.974
Are you serious?
Your pipe?

49:40.007 --> 49:42.608
You can't smoke with the oxygen.
I don't want it.

49:42.642 --> 49:44.477
What are you doing?
You need that.

49:45.012 --> 49:49.016
Roll that tank out of my room.
I mean to do it.

49:49.049 --> 49:50.583
Okay, I'll do it.

49:51.151 --> 49:52.785
The nurse will have
my head, though.

49:52.819 --> 49:56.622
The nurse won't come
till morning.

49:56.656 --> 49:58.591
She'll smell the smoke.

49:58.624 --> 50:00.827
Her perfume is worse.

50:04.064 --> 50:05.132
It's late.

50:05.165 --> 50:07.101
That it is.

50:09.036 --> 50:12.772
I saw a star out the window,
down near the ground.

50:12.805 --> 50:14.841
Have you ever seen
a star down low?

50:14.874 --> 50:17.311
When I was a boy,
from that very window.

50:17.344 --> 50:20.147
Light it for me.

50:20.180 --> 50:21.748
All right.

50:27.321 --> 50:30.190
I see it. The star.

50:30.224 --> 50:32.092
This was your room.

50:48.175 --> 50:50.044
I'm choking.
I told ya.

50:50.077 --> 50:51.178
Don't matter. I like it.

50:51.211 --> 50:52.612
No.

50:53.646 --> 50:55.782
Sit by me, son.

50:57.850 --> 51:00.220
I'm sorry to be leaving you,
Anthony.

51:00.853 --> 51:03.123
Don't say it.
I'm sorry.

51:03.157 --> 51:07.693
It's a lonely spot here and it'll be
hard to face the morning when I'm gone.

51:08.027 --> 51:09.096
Jesus.

51:10.230 --> 51:11.964
The farm is yours now.

51:12.965 --> 51:16.736
I'm sorry to be leaving it
to you not as it was given me.

51:16.769 --> 51:18.738
Don't think of it.
It's nothing.

51:18.771 --> 51:21.375
Listen, son. Your mam.

51:21.408 --> 51:22.809
I didn't love her.

51:23.377 --> 51:25.112
- What are you saying?
- Truth.

51:26.313 --> 51:27.947
The loneliness...

51:28.748 --> 51:31.717
had gotten into me and I
don't know why she said yes.

51:32.718 --> 51:36.223
I walked by her half the time
without so much as a nod.

51:36.256 --> 51:41.228
She bore me children.
Trish, Audrey, you. I felt nothing.

51:41.261 --> 51:43.197
Till one day...

51:44.398 --> 51:45.998
something...

51:47.867 --> 51:49.136
gave way.

51:50.337 --> 51:53.639
Out in the fields
in the wet grass...

51:54.274 --> 51:56.276
the quiet hand of God
touched me.

51:56.310 --> 51:59.812
Something came
to save me, some...

52:00.414 --> 52:02.849
And it'll come for you,
too.

52:03.883 --> 52:08.388
I can't name the day
the rain let up.

52:08.422 --> 52:11.258
The sun shone on me.

52:11.291 --> 52:16.396
And I started in singing.
Just like that. That old song.

52:16.430 --> 52:20.267
- Mam's song. Do you know it?
- Sure, I do.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.336
<i>♪ And they'll all
Go together ♪</i>

52:22.369 --> 52:25.004
<i>♪ To pull wild
Mountain thyme ♪</i>

52:25.037 --> 52:28.040
Singing! In the field.

52:29.443 --> 52:30.910
Me.

52:33.980 --> 52:37.817
I was never that man
and I knew it was Mary's song.

52:37.850 --> 52:39.386
And I sold off that bit
by the road

52:39.419 --> 52:42.189
to Muldoon for 200 quid
and bought her...

52:43.089 --> 52:46.426
a real ring of gold
and took the brass one from her.

52:46.460 --> 52:50.129
Oh, what days we had
thereafter, the times...

52:50.930 --> 52:53.065
in the kitchen,
in every room.

52:53.099 --> 52:57.437
And I'm going to her now, son,
'cause I know she's waiting

52:58.104 --> 53:00.706
by that old front door
for me yet.

53:01.841 --> 53:03.410
Can you forgive me, Anthony?

53:03.443 --> 53:06.045
For what?
Selling the right of way?

53:06.078 --> 53:08.981
- It's nothing.
- For having no faith.

53:09.916 --> 53:13.420
That you'd find your own way,
be your own man.

53:13.453 --> 53:15.189
Am I proud of you too late, son?

53:15.222 --> 53:17.457
I don't want you to die.

53:17.491 --> 53:21.495
I'm sorry I sold
that bit by the road

53:21.528 --> 53:24.163
and left you with two gates.

53:25.831 --> 53:29.168
And that I thought
of taking the rest from you.

53:30.370 --> 53:35.775
However I hurt you, I want to die
with a clean slate between us.

53:36.410 --> 53:38.945
Surely,
I forgive everything.

53:39.379 --> 53:41.080
I love you, son.

53:41.113 --> 53:42.882
I can't say it enough.

53:50.156 --> 53:54.093
I love you, my daddy.
My daddy, my daddy.

53:54.126 --> 53:56.996
Sure I always have.

54:05.104 --> 54:07.873
Let go
before you kill me.

54:08.542 --> 54:10.009
Right.

54:16.416 --> 54:17.883
Good man.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.289
You are a good son.

54:23.590 --> 54:25.091
Thanks, Da.

54:25.559 --> 54:30.763
I have faith
that love will find you

54:31.163 --> 54:33.199
out in those fields

54:33.866 --> 54:36.370
where you wander.

54:38.538 --> 54:40.106
God bless you.

54:43.443 --> 54:45.312
And you.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.014
I'll sleep now.

54:55.355 --> 54:57.023
Do you want the oxygen?

54:57.591 --> 54:59.393
I'll try without.

55:22.482 --> 55:24.618
<i>My daddy.</i>

55:24.651 --> 55:28.120
<i>My daddy, my daddy.</i>

55:51.645 --> 55:53.413
Good morning.

55:53.447 --> 55:54.581
What's this?

55:55.649 --> 55:58.552
Cleaned out the high pasture.
They're like locusts.

55:58.585 --> 56:00.219
God love 'em.

56:11.531 --> 56:13.433
Crows have a lot to say.

56:14.266 --> 56:16.202
Wish your father
had killed them all.

56:16.235 --> 56:17.604
He tried.

56:17.637 --> 56:19.373
Still smoking, I see.

56:23.309 --> 56:25.412
Brought you some stew
on the bench there.

56:27.079 --> 56:29.281
- I can cook.
- You don't though.

56:29.315 --> 56:33.152
And now that Mam's gone I've got
no one to do for. It keeps me busy.

56:33.185 --> 56:34.987
Right.

56:35.020 --> 56:36.390
It's good
walking weather.

56:37.022 --> 56:38.625
One place is
the same as another.

56:38.658 --> 56:40.427
How can you say it?

56:40.460 --> 56:43.095
I was down at the bog cutting turf.
The heather is everywhere.

56:43.129 --> 56:44.664
You're cutting your own turf?

56:44.698 --> 56:45.998
Who else?

56:46.031 --> 56:48.402
It's a bit late.
Got to it.

56:48.435 --> 56:50.302
It's a two-man job.

56:50.670 --> 56:52.439
Or one woman.

56:53.272 --> 56:54.306
Yep.

56:54.674 --> 56:56.041
That's the world now.

56:56.676 --> 56:59.479
- Men are useless.
- That's not so.

56:59.513 --> 57:01.046
What?
Men aren't useless.

57:02.014 --> 57:04.216
What's a man for now?
What's his place?

57:04.250 --> 57:06.453
That's for you to say.
And I'm not talking.

57:07.587 --> 57:10.990
Maybe the quiet around a thing is
as important as the thing itself.

57:11.023 --> 57:13.259
Do you still hear
the voice in the fields?

57:17.631 --> 57:19.098
I don't know.

57:19.599 --> 57:21.468
It's not a modern idea.

57:22.602 --> 57:23.703
I'm not a modern man.

57:23.737 --> 57:25.938
You have the farm.

57:26.405 --> 57:28.340
I do.
Are you happy?

57:33.447 --> 57:34.947
No.

57:36.081 --> 57:38.384
Why not go ahead, be happy?

57:40.754 --> 57:42.354
Don't know how.

57:42.388 --> 57:45.958
There is no one left
to catch you laughing, Anthony.

57:46.358 --> 57:47.727
True.

57:47.761 --> 57:50.429
How many days do we have
while the sun shines?

57:50.464 --> 57:52.064
It's not shining.

57:52.097 --> 57:54.233
I believe that it is.

57:56.101 --> 57:57.537
You all right then?

57:59.271 --> 58:00.507
In what way?

58:06.546 --> 58:09.048
Up there in the house,
alone.

58:13.118 --> 58:15.421
I see you put
this gate between us.

58:16.523 --> 58:18.257
I did.
Why?

58:23.530 --> 58:26.098
I've been having
such dreams.

58:26.131 --> 58:28.602
Dreaming about everyone
who ever lived.

58:29.335 --> 58:31.070
That's a lot.

58:31.103 --> 58:32.806
Ancestors, and more.

58:32.839 --> 58:35.609
The whole circus.
The history of people.

58:35.642 --> 58:39.411
And me at the front like the
leader of some marching band.

58:39.445 --> 58:43.650
Jesus, I sat up in me bed.
Didn't know what to make of it.

58:43.683 --> 58:45.519
Here I am,
alone as a castaway,

58:45.552 --> 58:48.354
and my night is spilling over
with people.

58:50.389 --> 58:53.025
We're known to each other
quite the while now.

58:55.662 --> 58:57.196
Yeah, we are.

58:57.864 --> 59:00.132
Have you ever thought about
what I said?

59:00.165 --> 59:01.535
Which? We never speak.

59:01.568 --> 59:02.736
I see you at church.

59:02.769 --> 59:05.404
I wouldn't go if you didn't.

59:08.374 --> 59:11.277
I think you should evacuate
this country altogether.

59:14.446 --> 59:15.649
Do you mean it?

59:16.348 --> 59:18.618
Why not?
Do you want me to?

59:19.553 --> 59:21.186
Maybe you should.

59:21.588 --> 59:23.289
Maybe I will.

59:27.594 --> 59:29.596
Come by the house sometime.

59:31.196 --> 59:33.465
I will maybe.
You won't.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.101
You should
quit the smokes.

59:36.135 --> 59:38.370
Maybe I will vacate
the country!

59:51.885 --> 59:53.853
Maybe I will.

1:01:08.662 --> 1:01:10.764
Today is the day.

1:01:55.507 --> 1:01:57.643
It's like teeth, isn't it?

1:01:58.610 --> 1:02:01.447
Come again.
The buildings look like teeth.

1:02:02.916 --> 1:02:04.751
Okay.

1:02:05.752 --> 1:02:07.486
What got you
on the plane?

1:02:07.854 --> 1:02:10.255
I lost my sense of purpose.

1:02:11.390 --> 1:02:13.692
I have to go back
tomorrow.

1:02:14.961 --> 1:02:16.528
What? You're kidding.

1:02:16.562 --> 1:02:19.665
No, I've hired a man
for two days, no more.

1:02:19.698 --> 1:02:21.868
You came here for one day?

1:02:21.901 --> 1:02:24.670
I did. I bought tickets
to the ballet.

1:02:24.703 --> 1:02:26.371
Will you take me?

1:02:28.975 --> 1:02:30.375
Okay.

1:03:51.490 --> 1:03:56.830
I have to say, you looked like an absolute
goddess today watching that ballet.

1:03:58.397 --> 1:04:01.067
She protected him.

1:04:01.733 --> 1:04:04.403
Who? The bird?
The white swan.

1:04:05.004 --> 1:04:06.738
You're the white swan.

1:04:08.007 --> 1:04:09.641
How did you know?

1:04:10.877 --> 1:04:13.847
I was joking.
I am, though.

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.814
Listen, Rosemary, I...

1:04:16.815 --> 1:04:18.684
I'm from the school of thought
where it's best

1:04:18.717 --> 1:04:21.020
not to let romantic ideas
ruin your life.

1:04:21.054 --> 1:04:22.856
Who's doing that?

1:04:22.889 --> 1:04:24.123
You?

1:04:24.157 --> 1:04:26.758
But my head's
a lot harder than yours.

1:04:27.559 --> 1:04:29.162
Right, but if you want
to be happy,

1:04:29.195 --> 1:04:31.697
you have to be
a little more realistic.

1:04:35.034 --> 1:04:37.536
I'm not so sure
about love, but...

1:04:38.104 --> 1:04:40.006
marriage is
a practical partnership.

1:04:40.039 --> 1:04:41.607
"Who's gonna take out
the trash?"

1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:43.442
That kind of thing.
What marriage?

1:04:44.843 --> 1:04:47.412
Do you want to be married?

1:04:47.446 --> 1:04:48.780
Is that a proposal?

1:04:48.814 --> 1:04:52.584
No. I mean in general.
Do you want to be married?

1:04:52.952 --> 1:04:55.387
I suppose.
Me too.

1:04:56.622 --> 1:04:59.158
Anthony, however, I don't think
he's the marrying kind.

1:04:59.192 --> 1:05:01.693
How would you know?
Because you're right there.

1:05:03.196 --> 1:05:04.931
You are right next door.

1:05:06.032 --> 1:05:07.166
And nothing happened.

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:08.902
I'm not next door now.

1:05:08.935 --> 1:05:10.402
No, you are not.

1:05:11.204 --> 1:05:12.939
And I find that
very promising.

1:05:15.942 --> 1:05:17.709
Have you ever had a dream...

1:05:19.178 --> 1:05:21.413
like since
you were a child...

1:05:22.949 --> 1:05:25.018
and you couldn't let it go?

1:05:25.051 --> 1:05:26.618
Sure.

1:05:27.486 --> 1:05:29.022
What did you do?

1:05:29.055 --> 1:05:31.057
I let it go.
Why?

1:05:31.090 --> 1:05:34.826
Because the kinds of dreams
kids have make adults miserable.

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.997
Like a banker dreaming
of being a farmer?

1:05:40.632 --> 1:05:41.833
Sure.

1:05:43.602 --> 1:05:45.038
But let me ask you this.

1:05:46.738 --> 1:05:49.841
Has your dream made you
happy or miserable?

1:05:55.248 --> 1:05:57.083
Look at the lights
everywhere.

1:05:57.116 --> 1:05:58.217
Everything to
your satisfaction?

1:05:58.251 --> 1:05:59.885
'Twas grand.

1:06:00.552 --> 1:06:02.554
The river is gorgeous.

1:06:11.998 --> 1:06:14.900
Oh, my God.
What did you do?

1:06:17.270 --> 1:06:19.604
You know
exactly what I did.

1:06:21.707 --> 1:06:23.242
And now being the gentleman
that I am,

1:06:23.276 --> 1:06:25.244
I'm going to walk you
back to your hotel.

1:06:25.278 --> 1:06:27.013
Oh, my God.

1:06:29.182 --> 1:06:30.916
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1:06:34.087 --> 1:06:35.288
Oh, my God.

1:06:42.028 --> 1:06:44.529
Hello? Oh, hey, Adam.

1:06:44.563 --> 1:06:46.132
Yeah, I'm flying over.

1:06:46.898 --> 1:06:48.800
Is that right?
Well, all right.

1:06:48.834 --> 1:06:51.270
I wanted to get your opinion
on something. Um...

1:06:52.038 --> 1:06:54.740
I don't want to step
on anybody's toes, but...

1:06:57.676 --> 1:07:01.580
Do you now?
Uh, uh...

1:07:01.613 --> 1:07:04.983
No. No, no, no, no, no problem.

1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:08.653
Uh-huh.

1:07:09.255 --> 1:07:10.822
Well, uh...

1:07:12.058 --> 1:07:13.558
Do you mean it?

1:07:15.061 --> 1:07:18.097
Well, okay. All right, okay.

1:07:19.831 --> 1:07:20.932
Bye.

1:08:31.770 --> 1:08:33.672
<i>Anthony.</i>

1:08:45.016 --> 1:08:46.952
<i>Anthony.</i>

1:09:24.055 --> 1:09:25.824
Anthony, I've seen ya!

1:09:26.758 --> 1:09:29.428
- Go back down.
- Don't order me on my own property.

1:09:29.462 --> 1:09:32.231
- Do you mind that much?
- Come down to the house.

1:09:32.265 --> 1:09:35.767
- I can't. I have a full day.
- Don't you dare! I've seen enough of your back.

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:41.006
- I have a full day, I tell ya.
- Don't point that thing at Blister. He'll kill us both!

1:09:43.842 --> 1:09:45.211
<i>Irish Farmer.</i>

1:09:46.479 --> 1:09:49.080
You're not
an Irish farmer, though.

1:09:49.114 --> 1:09:50.782
How do you know?

1:09:50.815 --> 1:09:53.051
Well, for one thing you
don't look tired enough,

1:09:53.084 --> 1:09:56.222
and for another your hands
don't look like feet.

1:09:58.224 --> 1:10:02.195
Okay, well, everyone has a
fantasy, and mine is farming.

1:10:04.297 --> 1:10:05.730
What?

1:10:06.499 --> 1:10:09.768
Most men's fantasies
aren't about farms.

1:10:19.378 --> 1:10:21.079
Open the shutters.

1:10:21.112 --> 1:10:23.882
It's a good day
to keep them shut maybe.

1:10:23.915 --> 1:10:26.918
I'll take what comes.
Go open them.

1:10:40.198 --> 1:10:42.000
Open the shutters.

1:10:45.404 --> 1:10:47.105
Take what comes.

1:10:49.874 --> 1:10:51.910
Miss High and Mighty.

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:26.778
Rosemary!
Coming.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.913
Mother of Christ.

1:11:29.482 --> 1:11:31.550
Rosemary!
Hold on, hold on.

1:11:31.584 --> 1:11:34.152
Jesus Christ!

1:11:34.185 --> 1:11:35.588
Come in! Come in!

1:11:35.621 --> 1:11:37.222
Did you see that?

1:11:37.255 --> 1:11:40.459
I saw. It's rain.
Just give us the coat.

1:11:41.192 --> 1:11:43.028
You should see to your horse.
She's all right.

1:11:43.061 --> 1:11:45.498
No, she's raising hell.
There's nothing new there.

1:11:45.531 --> 1:11:46.632
I can't stay.

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:51.236
Are you serious? Look at yourself.
Take off those boots.

1:11:52.505 --> 1:11:54.307
Jesus. You've
every light burning.

1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:56.174
It's in your honor.

1:11:56.207 --> 1:11:58.477
It's a fortune in electricity.
I'm half blind with it.

1:11:58.511 --> 1:11:59.578
Is that better?

1:11:59.612 --> 1:12:02.113
Just.

1:12:02.147 --> 1:12:04.916
- What?
- Jesus, would you look at the rain?

1:12:04.949 --> 1:12:06.452
- It'd drown a fish!
- It would.

1:12:06.485 --> 1:12:07.986
Oh, God.

1:12:08.019 --> 1:12:09.455
Flossie! What's she doing?

1:12:09.488 --> 1:12:10.623
She's jealous, I'd say.

1:12:10.656 --> 1:12:12.123
Your horse is no better.

1:12:12.157 --> 1:12:14.926
- Bad cess to her. Let her drown!
- I will not!

1:12:16.928 --> 1:12:19.197
- You shouldn't have let her in.
- Why not?

1:12:19.230 --> 1:12:20.599
I let you in.

1:12:20.633 --> 1:12:23.034
- It's all right, Flossie.
- Come on now.

1:12:23.068 --> 1:12:26.104
Here, make yourself useful.
Swab that floor.

1:12:37.082 --> 1:12:39.618
Mother of God, don't look.
The house is in ruins.

1:12:39.652 --> 1:12:41.920
What are you talking?
It's a bloody showcase.

1:12:41.953 --> 1:12:44.289
No, it's a sty.
If I'd known you were coming...

1:12:44.322 --> 1:12:46.324
Is it a bad time?
Well, what time isn't?

1:12:46.359 --> 1:12:49.961
You know, if it weren't
for rare signs from heaven,

1:12:49.994 --> 1:12:52.063
I'd have nothing
in me mind but doom.

1:12:52.097 --> 1:12:53.499
Rare signs from heaven,
is it?

1:12:53.532 --> 1:12:56.502
And few they are.
Here, sit down.

1:12:56.535 --> 1:12:59.572
Sit down. You're three quarters drowned.
Here's a towel.

1:12:59.605 --> 1:13:01.407
I have a handkerchief.

1:13:02.441 --> 1:13:05.511
Jesus God. How long has
that been in your pocket?

1:13:05.544 --> 1:13:08.346
I don't know.
It's half alive.

1:13:08.381 --> 1:13:12.016
Here. Give it. I'll wash it,
if it doesn't jump up and run.

1:13:12.050 --> 1:13:15.521
- Look, I have to go. I'll come back another time.
- You'll come back, will you?

1:13:15.554 --> 1:13:17.590
It's your first time here
since never.

1:13:17.623 --> 1:13:19.290
Put down the weed whacker.

1:13:19.692 --> 1:13:21.926
It's not a weed whacker.
It's a metal detector.

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:24.929
What are you after out there
besides the odd treasure?

1:13:25.698 --> 1:13:27.932
Unexpected stuff.

1:13:27.966 --> 1:13:29.602
- Coins maybe.
- Coins.

1:13:29.635 --> 1:13:31.437
You're out looking for coins
in this weather?

1:13:31.470 --> 1:13:34.139
Rosemary, I...
Just let me see if I have a Guinness.

1:13:35.574 --> 1:13:37.543
I have a full day.

1:13:37.576 --> 1:13:40.178
- <i>Why do you make everything so hard?</i>
- <i>Me?</i>

1:13:40.211 --> 1:13:43.047
Well, not you specifically.
The Irish.

1:13:43.716 --> 1:13:48.454
It's like they never can really
seize the day, make a move.

1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:51.990
Well, it's an island, you know?
You gotta be careful.

1:13:52.023 --> 1:13:53.726
You don't want to call
attention to yourself.

1:13:53.759 --> 1:13:55.293
Well, see, I like attention.

1:13:55.326 --> 1:13:57.630
Of course you do.
You're an American.

1:13:58.329 --> 1:14:00.198
I tell ya, I'm just here
for the minute.

1:14:00.231 --> 1:14:02.200
You will visit
or I'll know why.

1:14:02.233 --> 1:14:04.470
Now, they say this new bottled
Guinness is as good as the pub,

1:14:04.503 --> 1:14:07.105
but that's a lie,
but it isn't too bad, maybe.

1:14:07.138 --> 1:14:08.574
Does it taste of glass?

1:14:08.607 --> 1:14:10.241
It does.

1:14:11.544 --> 1:14:13.077
You know what?
Don't open it.

1:14:13.111 --> 1:14:14.447
I'm going to open it.
Don't.

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.014
It's done. I've opened it.

1:14:16.047 --> 1:14:18.183
Jesus.
It's useless but to drink now.

1:14:18.216 --> 1:14:20.418
All right, share it with me.
Me? I couldn't.

1:14:20.453 --> 1:14:23.054
- Pour it out into two glasses.
- You're only saying that

1:14:23.087 --> 1:14:24.457
to divide the time
in half you'll stay.

1:14:24.490 --> 1:14:26.492
Sit down and share it
or I won't touch it.

1:14:26.525 --> 1:14:30.428
Look at you. You are a demon
tempting me with a drink.

1:14:47.078 --> 1:14:49.280
- <i>Slàinte.</i>
- <i>Slàinte.</i>

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:04.062
Jesus,
have you got a rope?

1:15:04.095 --> 1:15:06.397
It's a perfect day
to be hanging yourself.

1:15:06.799 --> 1:15:08.701
Don't joke.
Do you think about it?

1:15:08.734 --> 1:15:11.504
What? No.

1:15:11.537 --> 1:15:12.771
Why? Do you think about it?

1:15:12.805 --> 1:15:15.306
Suicide?
I think of little else.

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:18.243
You're not serious. Should probably
blow meself up and be done.

1:15:18.276 --> 1:15:20.111
- With what?
- The shotgun.

1:15:20.144 --> 1:15:22.080
Your father's old cannon?
You don't still have it?

1:15:22.113 --> 1:15:24.349
I do. She lives in the hall closet.
Loaded and ready.

1:15:24.382 --> 1:15:26.317
- I don't believe it.
- See for yourself.

1:15:36.562 --> 1:15:38.531
Jesus.
Why do you keep it?

1:15:38.564 --> 1:15:39.765
Against the depression.

1:15:39.798 --> 1:15:41.399
What? You're depressed?

1:15:42.133 --> 1:15:44.469
Are you serious?
I'm shattered with depression.

1:15:44.502 --> 1:15:47.272
I'm shattered with black
clouds of depression.

1:15:47.305 --> 1:15:48.139
But why?

1:15:48.172 --> 1:15:50.275
Since I quit the cigarettes.

1:15:50.308 --> 1:15:53.411
Oh, yeah, I heard you quit the damn smokes.
That's very good.

1:15:53.444 --> 1:15:55.781
No, it isn't.
I've thought of taking poison.

1:15:55.814 --> 1:16:00.084
I can't stand being alive. It's like a
kettle boiling blood that comes up into me.

1:16:00.118 --> 1:16:01.486
You know, all these feelings.

1:16:01.519 --> 1:16:04.422
Jesus, your own blood
turning against you.

1:16:05.189 --> 1:16:07.458
I can see it.
Is it that plain?

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:11.162
Sit down again.
Don't stand over me.

1:16:13.197 --> 1:16:17.268
It's only the rare signs from
heaven that give me hope.

1:16:17.302 --> 1:16:20.338
What you've got is anxiety.
That's what it is.

1:16:20.371 --> 1:16:22.173
Is that the name for it?
Sure.

1:16:22.206 --> 1:16:24.175
It comes over me in waves.
It's nothing.

1:16:24.208 --> 1:16:26.311
It's feelings boiling up,
isn't it?

1:16:26.344 --> 1:16:28.714
Sure, I hate them.
Feelings are useless.

1:16:28.747 --> 1:16:30.381
I think it's worse in a man.

1:16:30.415 --> 1:16:32.350
I can't stand a man
with feelings.

1:16:32.383 --> 1:16:34.620
A man with feelings
should be put down!

1:16:46.832 --> 1:16:48.701
Can I make you a sandwich?

1:16:51.235 --> 1:16:53.338
- No.
- I'm going to.

1:16:53.371 --> 1:16:56.474
I told ya, I have a full day.

1:17:10.254 --> 1:17:12.290
There you go, Flossie.

1:17:14.860 --> 1:17:16.260
The Guinness is good.

1:17:16.294 --> 1:17:18.664
- Do you like it?
- It's perfect.

1:17:18.697 --> 1:17:20.465
It's not the pub.

1:17:20.498 --> 1:17:22.300
No.

1:17:22.801 --> 1:17:24.637
You should come by more.

1:17:27.271 --> 1:17:29.374
A girl needs a chat.

1:17:30.709 --> 1:17:33.211
Can I make you
another sandwich?

1:17:33.244 --> 1:17:35.313
Rosemary, I have to go.
You do not!

1:17:35.346 --> 1:17:37.181
I have to get to the airport.

1:17:37.215 --> 1:17:38.784
My cousin is coming
from America.

1:17:39.550 --> 1:17:42.353
Who? Frank's son. Adam Reilly.

1:17:42.387 --> 1:17:45.323
Him? The show-off?
The one with the grand car?

1:17:45.356 --> 1:17:46.859
The one who missed
all the funerals?

1:17:46.892 --> 1:17:48.894
Yes, that one. He's...

1:17:48.927 --> 1:17:50.461
He's going to want
to be brought round.

1:17:50.495 --> 1:17:52.330
What do you mean?
Well, he called me.

1:17:52.363 --> 1:17:55.166
- He did?
- He's going to want to meet people.

1:17:55.566 --> 1:17:56.702
Which?

1:17:57.435 --> 1:17:59.270
- Well, you'd be good.
- Me?

1:17:59.303 --> 1:18:01.272
We could swing by.

1:18:01.305 --> 1:18:05.711
Swing by? You've never swung
by anywhere in your life.

1:18:08.312 --> 1:18:10.515
All right, if you want to know
the utter truth...

1:18:11.449 --> 1:18:14.419
I believe Adam is coming from
America in search of a wife.

1:18:17.355 --> 1:18:18.824
That seems
a long way to come.

1:18:18.857 --> 1:18:22.326
He has an idea an Irish woman
would be made of better stuff

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.562
than these girls
he meets in America.

1:18:24.595 --> 1:18:28.299
- That's true. What about Mary O'Connor?
- Mary O'Connor?

1:18:28.934 --> 1:18:30.468
Does she still have
that whistling tooth?

1:18:30.501 --> 1:18:33.504
Yeah, she does. God love her.
No, I was...

1:18:34.338 --> 1:18:36.742
I was thinking more
somebody like you.

1:18:39.812 --> 1:18:41.747
Me?

1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:44.449
What? Who's like me?
Well...

1:18:44.950 --> 1:18:46.752
y-you are.

1:18:47.820 --> 1:18:51.556
I was thinking that maybe I
might let him take a look at you.

1:18:52.457 --> 1:18:54.659
Take a look at me
in what way?

1:18:57.628 --> 1:18:58.696
Your beauty.

1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:04.535
My beauty.

1:19:04.569 --> 1:19:07.806
Well, this is the first
I've heard about beauty.

1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.440
Oh, don't pretend
you don't know.

1:19:09.474 --> 1:19:11.409
Do you want to put me
in a shop window

1:19:11.442 --> 1:19:13.812
like one of those Euro
floozies in Amsterdam?

1:19:13.846 --> 1:19:16.614
What are you talking about? Amsterdam?
I'm talking about your cousin!

1:19:16.647 --> 1:19:21.252
And you'd bring him round to look me
over, would ya? Like I was a red heifer.

1:19:21.854 --> 1:19:24.022
I see what you mean about
the smoking and giving it up.

1:19:24.056 --> 1:19:25.758
- You're not yourself.
- How would you know?

1:19:25.791 --> 1:19:28.026
- Your temper's rough.
- Did he offer you money?

1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:31.864
- I've got to get the car. He'll be waiting.
- Don't walk out on me.

1:19:31.897 --> 1:19:34.800
I have to go. Don't you make
me reach for that shotgun.

1:19:34.833 --> 1:19:37.301
Jesus Christ, Rosemary. The shotgun?
What are you talking?

1:19:37.335 --> 1:19:39.637
If you turn your back on me,

1:19:39.670 --> 1:19:42.841
I swear by Satan,
I will blow a hole in ya.

1:19:42.875 --> 1:19:45.476
Christ, Rosemary, if it's this
bad, go back on the cigarettes.

1:19:45.510 --> 1:19:47.946
You'd put me back
on the smokes, would ya?

1:19:47.980 --> 1:19:49.514
Bad cess to ya.

1:19:49.547 --> 1:19:51.382
Hey, don't be cursing me!

1:19:51.415 --> 1:19:53.451
After what I've been through
with the detoxification.

1:19:53.484 --> 1:19:55.553
Just sit down.
You're upsetting Flossie.

1:19:55.586 --> 1:19:57.588
He lands soon.
I still have to get the car.

1:19:57.622 --> 1:20:00.391
I'll drive ya.
You'll be there. Sit down.

1:20:06.564 --> 1:20:08.666
You'll calm yourself then.
All right.

1:20:08.699 --> 1:20:11.502
Shh.

1:20:13.671 --> 1:20:16.975
- You'll have another Guinness.
- I can't have two.

1:20:17.009 --> 1:20:19.077
You haven't had one.
You had a half.

1:20:19.111 --> 1:20:21.779
Jesus Christ.
Shh. Peace now.

1:20:37.728 --> 1:20:39.430
Drink the Guinness.

1:20:40.866 --> 1:20:42.600
Go on.

1:20:44.602 --> 1:20:46.872
- Isn't that nice?
- Mm-hmm.

1:20:53.879 --> 1:20:55.446
Are you a homosexual?

1:20:55.479 --> 1:20:57.815
- What?
- Are you gay? Are you gay?

1:20:57.850 --> 1:20:58.884
No!

1:21:00.085 --> 1:21:01.485
No.

1:21:13.098 --> 1:21:14.632
Don't stand over me.

1:21:20.906 --> 1:21:24.609
Why would you try to give
me away to your cousin?

1:21:25.509 --> 1:21:27.478
It's a solid idea.

1:21:28.013 --> 1:21:30.148
He's a fine lad.
He's rich.

1:21:30.182 --> 1:21:32.117
So what?
So what?

1:21:32.150 --> 1:21:34.485
Don't you want to be rich?
No, I want a man!

1:21:34.518 --> 1:21:37.022
Adam's a man.
Adam smells like soap.

1:21:37.788 --> 1:21:40.025
He smells like
the lilies of the field.

1:21:40.058 --> 1:21:42.060
Why do you want to
smell the cows on me

1:21:42.094 --> 1:21:43.896
when you can smell
the lilies on him?

1:21:43.929 --> 1:21:46.664
I'm the one who should smell good.
A man should stink.

1:21:46.697 --> 1:21:49.433
Like you!
Oh, well, thanks for that!

1:21:49.467 --> 1:21:51.203
- Don't provoke me!
- Me provoke?

1:21:51.236 --> 1:21:53.939
The fact of you is enough
to put me off my game.

1:21:59.244 --> 1:22:01.579
It's good
that you're tall.

1:22:03.248 --> 1:22:05.083
Men are beasts.

1:22:06.550 --> 1:22:10.688
They need that height to balance
the truth and the goodness of women.

1:22:12.790 --> 1:22:15.693
There's no answer
to blather like that.

1:22:19.264 --> 1:22:22.034
Hope, it's a force...

1:22:23.268 --> 1:22:26.238
and women are the salvation
of the world.

1:22:26.271 --> 1:22:29.874
I believe that.
I mean to make you believe it.

1:22:31.709 --> 1:22:33.644
I'd like to believe it.

1:22:37.215 --> 1:22:40.551
There's no truth to that business
of you and the donkey, is there?

1:22:40.584 --> 1:22:43.055
- Who told you that?
- I never believed it.

1:22:43.088 --> 1:22:44.990
I'll kill Cleary one day.

1:22:47.525 --> 1:22:49.995
You should have come
for yourself.

1:22:52.064 --> 1:22:53.764
No.

1:22:56.168 --> 1:23:00.538
Thought maybe it was the
cigarettes put you off, so I quit.

1:23:00.571 --> 1:23:02.740
You did that with regards to me?
I did.

1:23:02.773 --> 1:23:06.144
Brought me to my knees. I can tell you,
my emotions were unspeakable, Anthony.

1:23:06.178 --> 1:23:09.081
Unspeakable.
I was desperate.

1:23:10.215 --> 1:23:12.583
I went to New York.

1:23:13.118 --> 1:23:15.653
- What? When?
- Tuesday.

1:23:17.155 --> 1:23:18.656
There goes the electric.

1:23:18.689 --> 1:23:21.525
You went to New York
on Tuesday? How?

1:23:21.559 --> 1:23:23.627
On a plane
and back Wednesday.

1:23:23.661 --> 1:23:26.999
You went to New York City
for one day?

1:23:28.599 --> 1:23:30.668
- And I kissed Adam.
- You what?

1:23:30.701 --> 1:23:33.671
I kissed him!
I kissed him, I kissed him.

1:23:35.374 --> 1:23:40.212
<i>Good morning, folks. We are
now starting our descent into Ireland.</i>

1:23:40.245 --> 1:23:41.779
Are you being met?

1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.749
I am, yes. You?

1:23:44.782 --> 1:23:46.051
No.

1:23:48.786 --> 1:23:50.188
You snore.

1:23:50.222 --> 1:23:53.091
Really?

1:23:53.125 --> 1:23:54.625
Yes.

1:23:54.658 --> 1:23:56.061
I don't think I do.

1:23:56.694 --> 1:23:58.863
Well,
you must be single.

1:24:15.213 --> 1:24:16.881
What stops you?
Is it Fiona?

1:24:16.914 --> 1:24:18.916
Are you still mooning over Fiona?
No.

1:24:18.949 --> 1:24:20.951
I think it's Fiona.
Oh, to hell with Fiona!

1:24:20.985 --> 1:24:23.321
I opened my heart to her
and she was gone like yesterday.

1:24:23.355 --> 1:24:25.157
What did you say to her?

1:24:25.190 --> 1:24:26.824
Never mind.

1:24:32.097 --> 1:24:34.031
- Say it to me.
- No.

1:24:44.209 --> 1:24:46.043
Have you ever wondered...

1:24:47.245 --> 1:24:50.082
what I wore
when I wore less?

1:24:51.149 --> 1:24:54.086
You've lost me.
Have you seen me naked in your mind?

1:24:54.119 --> 1:24:57.222
Oh, Jesus Christ, Rosemary. Naked?
Shut up with that. I see you at church.

1:24:57.255 --> 1:25:02.227
You say I'm beautiful.
So have you thought about me?

1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:04.662
Have you thought
about my shape?

1:25:05.796 --> 1:25:07.765
I don't know.
Have you thought about picking me up

1:25:07.798 --> 1:25:10.135
and carrying me off
to the moon?

1:25:12.270 --> 1:25:13.838
No.

1:25:13.871 --> 1:25:15.706
What is it? Just tell me.
Are you a virgin?

1:25:15.739 --> 1:25:17.375
I'm past the time!
I've still to get the car!

1:25:17.409 --> 1:25:18.876
No, I'm driving you!

1:25:18.909 --> 1:25:21.645
You kissed him!
It was he that kissed me!

1:25:21.679 --> 1:25:23.981
That's what got him worked up!
That's why he's coming!

1:25:24.014 --> 1:25:28.018
Time is running out.
Now you tell me your secret, Anthony.

1:25:28.886 --> 1:25:31.389
I told Fiona
and she ran like Satan.

1:25:31.423 --> 1:25:33.691
I am off-kilter.
It doesn't matter how.

1:25:33.724 --> 1:25:35.693
Is it because
you hate people?

1:25:35.726 --> 1:25:37.995
No, I don't hate no one!

1:25:38.028 --> 1:25:39.730
You can't shock me.

1:25:39.763 --> 1:25:42.766
I have thought of everything.
I've made my peace with it.

1:25:44.202 --> 1:25:45.736
Go on.

1:25:50.475 --> 1:25:52.643
What?

1:25:53.478 --> 1:25:55.012
All right.

1:25:56.181 --> 1:25:57.648
Okay.

1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:05.624
I believe that
I am a honey bee.

1:26:12.164 --> 1:26:13.831
Say that again.

1:26:18.436 --> 1:26:20.938
I believe that
I am a honey bee.

1:26:25.477 --> 1:26:27.179
I'll get the car.

1:26:34.151 --> 1:26:36.787
I don't believe it.
You don't think you're a honey bee!

1:26:36.820 --> 1:26:38.356
You're having me on.

1:26:38.390 --> 1:26:40.925
You do? How long?

1:26:40.958 --> 1:26:43.328
I don't know. I think that I'm a honey bee.
I always have.

1:26:43.361 --> 1:26:46.964
- You are Anthony Reilly.
- Whatever I am, God knows me.

1:26:46.997 --> 1:26:49.267
Is this why you never told me
I was beautiful?

1:26:49.301 --> 1:26:51.835
Well, that and the nearness
of your farm to mine.

1:26:51.869 --> 1:26:54.071
And it's true.
Bees don't like smoke.

1:26:54.104 --> 1:26:55.407
Let me drive.

1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:57.074
No.
Slow down.

1:26:57.107 --> 1:26:59.009
I don't care if you think
you're a bee, Anthony.

1:26:59.043 --> 1:27:02.314
You think you're a bee!
I mean, you think you're a bee!

1:27:02.347 --> 1:27:04.216
Keep your eyes on the road.

1:27:04.249 --> 1:27:05.483
Never mind! I don't care!

1:27:05.517 --> 1:27:08.220
I'm half dying
with living for you.

1:27:09.554 --> 1:27:11.423
Watch out!

1:27:11.456 --> 1:27:13.023
Mind the road.

1:27:13.824 --> 1:27:15.493
Do you think I'm a bee?
No.

1:27:15.527 --> 1:27:18.862
- May I know what I am?
- You're a flower.

1:27:18.896 --> 1:27:20.498
The most beautiful
bloom that grows.

1:27:20.532 --> 1:27:22.967
- Do you really think that?
- Yes.

1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.069
Anthony,
you are good for me.

1:27:25.102 --> 1:27:27.805
No, I'm a disgrace! We'll get Adam.
You've already kissed him.

1:27:27.838 --> 1:27:30.275
- He kissed me!
- You'll marry and go to America.

1:27:30.308 --> 1:27:32.444
- Have you never thought to marry me yourself?
- I have.

1:27:32.477 --> 1:27:34.845
- What stopped ya?
- I came to your house and when I looked

1:27:34.878 --> 1:27:37.315
for my Mam's ring,
sure I'd lost it altogether.

1:27:37.349 --> 1:27:41.519
Is that what you've been doing with that metal
detector? Looking for your mother's ring?

1:27:41.553 --> 1:27:43.854
The fact that I lost it
said it all.

1:27:43.887 --> 1:27:46.291
A man like me
should not marry.

1:27:46.324 --> 1:27:49.059
Watch out!

1:27:49.093 --> 1:27:51.195
You're going to
bust the axle.

1:27:51.228 --> 1:27:54.231
- Everybody thinks they're something they're not!
- But not a bee.

1:27:56.301 --> 1:27:58.270
Watch out! Watch out!

1:28:12.550 --> 1:28:14.386
You've destroyed the car.
It's fine.

1:28:14.419 --> 1:28:15.953
It's not fine!
It's my car!

1:28:15.986 --> 1:28:17.955
Look at it!
To hell with the car!

1:28:25.597 --> 1:28:28.433
What? Oh, perfect!

1:28:28.466 --> 1:28:31.035
Perfect! Would you
make up your mind!

1:28:31.068 --> 1:28:32.970
Are you raining
or shining on us?

1:28:33.003 --> 1:28:36.040
Tell me, standing on
this holy land of Ireland,

1:28:36.073 --> 1:28:37.841
why shouldn't you marry me?

1:28:37.875 --> 1:28:40.144
I see things.
I'm delusional.

1:28:40.177 --> 1:28:42.913
For the love of God, woman,
I think I'm a bug.

1:28:42.946 --> 1:28:45.182
So what? Sometimes
I think I'm a house cat.

1:28:45.215 --> 1:28:47.851
- You do not!
- But I don't stay with it.

1:28:47.885 --> 1:28:50.087
Because I know I'm a swan.

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:52.624
You do not literally
think you're a swan.

1:28:52.657 --> 1:28:55.527
I do. Does that make me
useless as a wife?

1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:57.329
Don't muddy the waters.

1:28:57.362 --> 1:29:00.332
Jesus Christ in heaven,
we're walking in circles.

1:29:00.365 --> 1:29:01.633
We're standing on your land.

1:29:01.666 --> 1:29:04.301
Just give us a chance.

1:29:07.439 --> 1:29:10.107
If it was meant to be,
I'd have found the ring.

1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:14.479
We say what's meant.
Life is here. We name it.

1:29:14.512 --> 1:29:17.948
- But Adam is waiting.
- Look at me.

1:29:17.981 --> 1:29:20.117
Look how I look at you.

1:29:22.086 --> 1:29:25.089
I don't know if I can live
shut in a house with a woman.

1:29:25.122 --> 1:29:26.990
You can have the winds
and the fields.

1:29:27.024 --> 1:29:30.160
You just think of me
as the open door.

1:29:30.194 --> 1:29:31.463
And here, fool.

1:29:32.597 --> 1:29:34.932
You can have your ring, too.

1:29:34.965 --> 1:29:38.335
- What's this?
- Found it by my gate.

1:29:38.670 --> 1:29:40.070
My mother's ring.

1:29:40.104 --> 1:29:42.374
Thought it heaven-sent
to give me hope.

1:29:42.407 --> 1:29:47.645
What do I have to do? Do I have to
swat at you to get you to sting me?

1:29:47.679 --> 1:29:50.314
I'm afraid.
Of what?

1:29:50.347 --> 1:29:51.683
Of love.

1:29:51.716 --> 1:29:54.318
Just think of the pleasure.

1:29:58.322 --> 1:30:00.257
Take your ring.

1:30:02.394 --> 1:30:04.128
Sure it's yours.

1:30:04.562 --> 1:30:05.963
It always was.

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.241
That's it!

1:30:18.710 --> 1:30:20.478
What are you doing?

1:30:20.512 --> 1:30:23.080
Look up that hill.
What?

1:30:23.113 --> 1:30:25.315
There's a bit of light
up there.

1:30:25.349 --> 1:30:28.919
And I don't know about you, but I'm
goddamned tired of living in the rain.

1:30:33.458 --> 1:30:37.261
I'd like to bring a fella up
here who knows one song, not two.

1:30:37.294 --> 1:30:40.498
Don't let him escape.
Lock the door.

1:30:40.532 --> 1:30:42.299
I'm told he's got
a singing voice,

1:30:42.332 --> 1:30:44.201
but no one's heard it
save his wife.
