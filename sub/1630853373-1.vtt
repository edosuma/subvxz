WEBVTT

00:09.166 --> 00:10.600
Right here.

00:10.634 --> 00:12.900
This is the first place
I ever fished.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.800
This is where my grandfather
started fishing,

00:17.834 --> 00:19.700
his father before him.

00:21.367 --> 00:25.400
And, you know, I never
thought I'd throw lines
in my homeland.

00:25.433 --> 00:28.266
But after what happened
to king crab in Alaska...

00:30.333 --> 00:32.166
everyone's got to pick

00:32.200 --> 00:33.834
where they're going to make
their last stand.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
Norway is where
I'm going to make mine.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.033
Hey, guys.

01:01.066 --> 01:02.867
We're coming up on

01:08.934 --> 01:11.033
We don't normally stop here
before season.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.233
This year, I have to.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.333
Breaking news.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.033
For the first time
in a quarter of a century,

01:20.066 --> 01:22.400
Alaska's Department
of Fish and Game

01:22.433 --> 01:25.567
has closed Bristol Bay
red king crab

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
for the 2021 fall season.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.066
You know,
last year, we tried

01:30.100 --> 01:31.367
to keep this fishery open.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.333
Guys, I want you
to work with me.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.967
If we don't get
this crab caught,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.300
we are in big trouble.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.800
But it wasn't enough.

01:44.567 --> 01:45.767
He grabbed his clothes.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.166
For the first time
in a generation...

01:50.567 --> 01:52.133
damn thing's left in ashes.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.634
There's a lot of fishermen
that have chose this spot

02:00.667 --> 02:02.467
as their final resting place.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.400
Guys
that gave their lives

02:11.433 --> 02:12.667
to build this industry.

02:16.634 --> 02:18.734
We're not gonna let that all
be in vain.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.033
It's up to us
to protect this legacy...

02:24.734 --> 02:27.767
and defend the American dream.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.367
In the words of
John Paul Jones,

02:30.533 --> 02:32.400
"We have not yet begun
to fight."

02:36.700 --> 02:40.033
To the world's new frontier.

02:40.066 --> 02:43.100
It's been a while since I had
a family member on the boat.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.066
We'll see
what he's made of.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.467
We're gonna adapt.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.000
Whoo!

02:49.033 --> 02:50.700
Somewhere
we've never been.

02:50.734 --> 02:53.066
I am looking
for a boat in Norway.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.900
Watch it, watch it.

02:55.934 --> 02:57.500
Ahhh!

02:57.533 --> 02:59.367
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.000
If they think it's theirs,

03:01.033 --> 03:03.400
they don't know
what the
they're talking about.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.634
Oh, my God.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.400
It wouldn't pull the pot,
and now it's too full.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.000
Hey, that's beautiful.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.734
Yeah. I say,
long live the kings.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.567
Oh!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.066
- Oh!
- Oh!

03:23.500 --> 03:25.000
Damn it!

03:25.033 --> 03:26.600
Don't try this at home.

03:27.867 --> 03:28.867
Yeah, baby.

03:30.266 --> 03:31.500
Whoo!

03:43.767 --> 03:45.066
- Watch it, watch it.
- Oh!

03:54.433 --> 03:55.667
God be with us.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.867
King crab shut down.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.467
We have an incremental amount
of a pie that doesn't exist.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.834
For the first time
in a quarter century...

04:36.867 --> 04:38.934
Those pieces of paper
that have our quota,

04:38.967 --> 04:41.934
they're about as useful
as toilet paper right now.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.400
Red king crab,

04:43.433 --> 04:44.533
the prized catch

04:44.567 --> 04:47.233
of the Bering Sea fleet
is canceled.

04:47.266 --> 04:49.333
After
reviewing the summer survey

04:49.367 --> 04:51.567
from the National Marine
Fisheries Service,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.734
Alaska Fish and Game
found mature females

04:54.767 --> 04:59.166
are the lowest ever recorded
inside the trawl zone.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.734
Come on, guys.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.266
With captains
already out

05:02.300 --> 05:04.400
hundreds of thousands
in preparation

05:04.433 --> 05:06.200
for the fabled fishery,

05:06.233 --> 05:07.567
the sudden closure

05:07.600 --> 05:11.000
robs the fleet
of a $30 million payday.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.500
I have one
of the largest amounts

05:12.533 --> 05:15.033
of king crab to catch
in the fleet.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.900
That's how I make my money.

05:16.934 --> 05:18.867
And without that,

05:18.900 --> 05:21.400
what's a king crabber
that can't catch king crab?

05:22.800 --> 05:25.133
Now,
to fight for survival...

05:25.166 --> 05:28.367
Last time it closed,
we fished other things.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.967
We had to do whatever
it took to pay the bills.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.533
...captains must hunt
new species,

05:33.567 --> 05:37.967
chart new waters
and pioneer new fisheries.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.533
If you don't change
and you don't adapt,

05:40.567 --> 05:41.700
you're gone.

05:41.734 --> 05:45.467
Or face losing
everything they've built.

05:55.266 --> 05:56.567
Okay.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.600
You guys, come on out.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.700
Oh! Well,
that's a pretty cake.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.934
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.166
Here we go.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.700
What color is it?

06:19.367 --> 06:22.700
It's pink! It's pink!

06:22.734 --> 06:24.400
Really? It's a girl.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.000
- It's a girl.
- Oh, my God.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.800
It's a girl. You'll have
Mandy number two.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.867
So, have you picked the name?

06:30.900 --> 06:32.033
- We did.
- Yep.

06:32.066 --> 06:34.433
- You did?
- Yeah. We're planning on Sailor.

06:34.467 --> 06:36.567
- Sailor?
- Sailor?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.533
Well, that's a cute name.

06:38.567 --> 06:39.634
I love it.

06:42.166 --> 06:45.333
You know,
over the last decade,
just watching you

06:45.367 --> 06:47.767
persevere and your grit

06:47.800 --> 06:49.634
and your endurance,

06:49.667 --> 06:52.467
if you can pass that
on to my granddaughter,

06:52.500 --> 06:53.734
I couldn't be more proud.

06:56.066 --> 06:59.667
- Hey, you want to eat cake now?
- Yeah.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.066
Come on.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.033
You know,
I'm gonna bring her fishing
as soon as I can.

07:03.066 --> 07:04.367
Yeah, but how long
is that gonna be?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.467
You start salmon tendering
in the summers,

07:06.500 --> 07:08.133
get a couple of those
underneath your belt,
and then...

07:08.166 --> 07:10.000
- What, eight years old...
- ...if she's ready...

07:10.033 --> 07:11.900
- ...she's gonna come on the boat?
- That's right.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.367
I don't know, I don't think
I can handle that.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.533
As far as supplementing
our income,

07:29.567 --> 07:32.433
I don't know how to fill
that gap right now.

07:32.467 --> 07:35.000
The last time this happened
25 years ago,

07:35.033 --> 07:36.900
not everybody survived.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.133
We got to figure out something.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.734
I mean,
there's other options.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.834
Would there be a way
to lease more bairdi or--

07:43.867 --> 07:45.400
It's not going to be
a lot of crab,

07:45.433 --> 07:46.734
I can guarantee you that.

07:53.734 --> 07:54.867
What about Norway?

07:56.533 --> 07:58.166
I heard there's
a king crab fishery there.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.233
Just 'cause it's crab fishing
doesn't mean we can do it.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.233
It's a whole new industry.

08:05.266 --> 08:07.266
Different rules,
different regulations.

08:08.767 --> 08:10.600
You got to start all over.

08:10.634 --> 08:12.367
That's a big risk to take.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.166
But I'll make some calls.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.500
- Get back. Watch your back, baby.
- No.

08:32.533 --> 08:35.300
Okay. Okay.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.600
Big boys...
big boys coming up.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.533
- I'm getting excited.
- Yes.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.300
- Well, here's
- You got it.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.667
- We're going to have fun.
- Let's do it.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.200
Let's do it.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.500
This boat's not going
to sit and rust

08:56.533 --> 08:58.700
and I'm not going
to lose this boat.

08:58.734 --> 09:01.667
The Time Bandit's
going to survive
because we're fighters.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.300
There's other things to catch.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.700
There's a Pribilof
golden crab season

09:06.734 --> 09:08.867
that's worth
about $1.8 million

09:08.900 --> 09:10.300
and it's all for the taking.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.900
Without the red crab
that built his business...

09:14.934 --> 09:18.333
Sometimes you get lucky
and you get the golden ticket.

09:18.367 --> 09:21.433
...Time Bandit captain
Jonathan Hillstrand decides

09:21.467 --> 09:23.300
that when the going
gets tough,

09:23.333 --> 09:25.700
the tough get golden.

09:25.734 --> 09:28.200
This golden king crab
has been left abandoned

09:28.233 --> 09:29.934
because it's $3.25 a pound,

09:29.967 --> 09:32.300
it's only $400,000
worth of crab.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.100
All of a sudden
there's no red crab.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.767
So, they're paying $14 a pound

09:36.800 --> 09:39.400
for golden king crab now.

09:39.433 --> 09:42.200
14 karat gold crab.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.533
That changed the whole game.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.800
Known as a challenging
and cost prohibitive fishery,

09:47.834 --> 09:52.000
golden king crab, the deeper
dwelling cousins of red king

09:52.033 --> 09:54.500
now fetch four times as much,

09:54.533 --> 09:57.166
suddenly making the unfishable

09:57.200 --> 09:59.533
worth the risk.

09:59.567 --> 10:02.000
There's a lot
of money just sitting
there in the bottom,

10:02.033 --> 10:03.533
if we can catch it,

10:03.567 --> 10:05.033
you know, it's really deep

10:05.066 --> 10:06.867
and you can only bring
40 pots.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.300
It's not going to be easy.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.900
Golden crab
are about four times
as deep as king crab.

10:21.934 --> 10:23.533
One way or another,
we're catching crab.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.834
It's either that or...

10:26.867 --> 10:28.700
we just start dying
with the rest of the fleet.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.467
Are you guys ready?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.066
Roger.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.033
So we're looking
at doing this golden
crab fishery with John.

10:37.066 --> 10:39.367
We're gonna test launch
a pot here.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.667
Let's see how this works out.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.767
Setting these things
at 200 plus fathoms.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.433
We've got eight shots on it.
We've never set that deep,

10:49.467 --> 10:51.634
so we're gonna see how long
it's gonna take to hold these.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.300
Whoo!

10:59.333 --> 11:02.834
Joining the Time Bandit
in the golden king crab fishery...

11:02.867 --> 11:05.600
- Get that timer ready, Josh.
- Roger.

11:05.634 --> 11:08.100
...captains Josh Harris
and Casey McManus

11:08.133 --> 11:11.600
set their deepest pot
to date at 200 fathoms,

11:11.634 --> 11:14.900
timing the crew
as they simulate hauling

11:14.934 --> 11:17.533
on the unfamiliar
golden crab grounds.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.500
All right.
There he goes, dude.

11:29.533 --> 11:30.634
Boom.

11:32.433 --> 11:33.567
This is so crazy.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.934
I mean, we have enough line
on here to go to the moon.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.133
Did your old man ever
fish golden crab, Josh?

11:43.166 --> 11:44.533
No.

11:44.567 --> 11:45.767
Not even a little bit.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.734
Ghost of the old man
coming through the back door

12:01.767 --> 12:03.166
and wondering
what the hell we're doing.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.734
Even he's thinking
this is a crazy idea.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.734
Get your hand out of there.
Get your hand out of there.

12:23.767 --> 12:26.333
Hey, everybody, back up,
back up, back up, back up.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.300
Something's not right
in our block.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.734
- Broken.
- Broke the block.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.700
You gotta be
kidding me?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.266
...chain pull it.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.567
We're gonna have to use
these old chains...

12:55.600 --> 12:58.200
haul it fathom by fathom.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.333
And there's a lot of fathoms
on this

13:13.166 --> 13:14.600
We're at 13 minutes now,

13:14.634 --> 13:16.033
we've got about
another hour and a half

13:16.066 --> 13:17.734
before those box up.

13:17.767 --> 13:20.333
The Doomsday Clock right here.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.233
Coming up.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.867
I think we're just gonna need
more muscle on deck, Josh.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.200
What do you think
about calling in Brother Jake?

13:39.233 --> 13:40.800
Um, Jake's got a kid
on the way.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.433
He's not going anywhere.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.667
Coming up.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.400
What about, uh, Brother Shane?

13:50.467 --> 13:51.767
He's in good shape,

13:51.800 --> 13:52.934
and I think he'd help us here.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.667
We need an extra set
of hands out there right now.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.867
Uh, he just wanted
to touch Alaska since
the old man passed away.

14:11.066 --> 14:13.767
Shane
is Josh's older brother.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.934
Fished a little bit up here
25 years ago,

14:15.967 --> 14:19.100
but not... any time
in the recent past.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.233
Coming up.

14:21.266 --> 14:24.500
Until
this last summer, I didn't
even know about Shane.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.433
It's a touchy subject,

14:26.467 --> 14:28.800
but he's got all the heart
in the world.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.433
...we just kind of
lost touch there for a bit.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.900
My dad, I know he wanted
all three of us

14:40.934 --> 14:42.066
to go on the boat together.

14:45.266 --> 14:46.667
Maybe Casey's right.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.133
In Dutch Harbor...

15:06.000 --> 15:07.700
Lenny.
Jake, how you doing?

15:09.467 --> 15:11.867
It could be a lot better
if we had something to fish.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.600
Well, what
do you think about

15:16.634 --> 15:18.834
trying to catch us
some black cod?

15:18.867 --> 15:22.100
You know, the prices are
a little bit better right now.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.634
And, uh, unlike crab,

15:24.667 --> 15:27.266
there's a lot of them
in the surveys.

15:27.300 --> 15:31.233
They're expensive fish,
so I, I think it's something
to look at

15:31.266 --> 15:33.834
but where do you think
we can get some quota?

15:33.867 --> 15:36.467
There
might be some other
boats in the fleet

15:36.500 --> 15:38.200
that we can lease from.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.634
Dwyer. There's Sean Dwyer.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.033
He's fishing
Dungies right now,

15:47.066 --> 15:49.800
but he said something
about fishing black cod.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.900
Okay,
how about we try it in that?

15:51.934 --> 15:53.500
That might be
a good lead.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.200
- All right.
- Later, Lenny.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.367
Okay, bye.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.166
Hey Shy, will you tie
that up there on the stack?

16:05.734 --> 16:07.834
I got my whole crew up here.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.634
I've got my niece
working for me.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.467
I told them I'd have something
for them to do,

16:12.500 --> 16:13.667
something for us
to make money,

16:13.700 --> 16:15.634
but king crab is canceled.

16:15.667 --> 16:19.467
His career spent
building a red king crab empire,

16:19.500 --> 16:22.400
Captain Jake Anderson
and the crew of the Saga

16:22.433 --> 16:24.867
are reeling
from the sudden closure.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.800
Jake flew me
and the rest of the crew
in on Tuesday,

16:27.834 --> 16:30.367
and we still haven't figured
out what we're fishing yet,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.700
so we're all dying
to find out.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.200
- What's going on, Jake?
- Hey, man.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.033
How's the baby doing?

16:49.066 --> 16:51.100
Six-week-old baby girl,

16:51.133 --> 16:52.600
fresh out of the oven.

16:52.634 --> 16:54.200
Now
I'm just waiting to get my

16:54.233 --> 16:56.734
inaugural set of white
lace up tennis shoes

16:56.767 --> 16:58.600
to wear while I'm mowing
the lawn.

16:58.634 --> 16:59.767
Dad life.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.567
Yeah, right.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.400
I'm starting to get
the dad bod.

17:04.433 --> 17:06.066
Dad bod? Yeah.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.300
You got a pack running
with you.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.367
You got to keep the shoes
on those kids' feet man,
keep them fed.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.133
So I heard
you're fishing dungies.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.166
Yeah, dude.
With king crab closed...

17:18.200 --> 17:19.834
worth the shot.

17:19.867 --> 17:22.700
Um... what do you think about,

17:22.734 --> 17:24.967
um, having me fish
that black cod?

17:29.266 --> 17:33.066
It needs to be caught,
but it ain't an easy one.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.066
Have you ever fished
black cod before?

17:36.100 --> 17:38.033
- Never.
- Never.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.400
I mean, if I'm gonna
give you that quota,

17:41.433 --> 17:42.800
I got to have collateral.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.734
How about king crab quota?

17:46.767 --> 17:48.867
Not king crab. Not this year.

17:48.900 --> 17:49.967
Sorry.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.533
I have
my own opie quota but...

17:53.734 --> 17:56.200
I, I really need all of that.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.367
Yeah, I get it.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.066
I just...

17:59.100 --> 18:00.834
I mean, I got to have
a little something just,

18:00.867 --> 18:02.667
just to know that

18:02.700 --> 18:04.834
if I need to pay my bills,
I can too.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.533
I have the boat.

18:11.533 --> 18:14.634
Pink slip...
for the black cod quota.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.767
I'd rather see
you have it than the bank.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.567
If you're
willing to put the boat up

18:25.600 --> 18:27.266
'cause that's what
you're gonna lose anyway...

18:29.066 --> 18:30.700
yeah, that works for me, man.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.734
Let's do it.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.367
Uh,
I'm telling you this
right now, you know,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.433
I'm a get that cod.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.166
Yeah, man.
You're gonna catch it.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.133
Talk to you
soon, Sean. Thanks.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.166
Talk to you later.

18:44.266 --> 18:47.600
$2.5 million
of product trade for

18:47.634 --> 18:50.600
$2.5 million of steel.

18:50.634 --> 18:53.000
You can't get something
for nothing,

18:53.033 --> 18:55.467
so he needs something
that he can assure

18:55.500 --> 18:58.433
his shareholders that
they're gonna get their money.

18:58.467 --> 18:59.533
Jake's deal,

18:59.567 --> 19:03.300
catch the 500,000 pounds
of black cod quota

19:03.333 --> 19:07.100
or sign his boat over
to Captain Sean Dwyer.

19:07.133 --> 19:12.166
The thing is, with Jake
never having fished
black cod before,

19:12.200 --> 19:15.100
you have all these pots
hanging on one line.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.066
And in theory,
as you're hauling them,

19:17.100 --> 19:19.433
they're coming up
one at a time.

19:19.467 --> 19:20.734
But if you do it wrong

19:20.767 --> 19:23.100
and they're all
stuck together,

19:23.133 --> 19:24.567
it's crazy tension.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.867
It can rip the block off
the side of the boat.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.033
And it's dangerous.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.734
I mean, you can get
somebody killed out there.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.800
I'm risking everything,

19:34.834 --> 19:38.467
but I didn't get here
by playing it safe.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.734
Jake
takes on long-lining

19:41.767 --> 19:44.000
to catch $2.5 million worth

19:44.033 --> 19:46.934
of black cod or sable fish.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.834
With king crab closed,

19:48.867 --> 19:51.834
people are buying dungies
as fast as we can catch 'em.

19:51.867 --> 19:54.333
There's no limit
to how much you can catch.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.033
Allowing Sean
to expand his business

19:57.066 --> 20:00.200
into the $4 per pound
Dungeness Crab derby.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.533
There's a lot
of money on the table,

20:03.567 --> 20:05.100
there's only two boats registered.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.700
I'm excited.

20:06.734 --> 20:10.066
While for captains
John, Josh, and Casey...

20:10.100 --> 20:12.600
We don't have a choice.
Sink or swim.

20:12.634 --> 20:15.033
...the Time Bandit
and the Cornelia Marie

20:15.066 --> 20:17.300
are the only new vessels
to secure

20:17.333 --> 20:21.600
the coveted Pribilof
golden crab permits.

20:21.634 --> 20:24.734
I just lost, basically half
my income for the year

20:24.767 --> 20:25.800
in one day.

20:27.734 --> 20:30.600
I'm in the biggest
shipyard project

20:30.634 --> 20:32.166
I've ever had
on the Wizard right now.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.567
In the middle of stem
to stern repairs...

20:37.467 --> 20:38.900
The good news is
we've got

20:38.934 --> 20:42.300
small bairdi fish ready to get
out of town and go fish.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.467
...Captain Keith Colburn
seizes a lifeline

20:45.500 --> 20:49.333
from the $5.5 million
bairdi crab fishery.

20:49.367 --> 20:51.600
We're here
in Dutch Harbor.

20:51.634 --> 20:53.433
I'm fishing bairdi.

20:53.467 --> 20:56.500
Put a little bit of money
in our back pocket
while we can.

20:56.533 --> 20:59.233
Not satisfied
with mere survival,

20:59.266 --> 21:02.367
Captain Sig joins
the bairdi fray.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.634
And then I've already
got some irons in the fire,

21:05.667 --> 21:08.233
you know, for maybe doing
something in Norway as well.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.266
But if his compass
points true Norse...

21:13.400 --> 21:15.066
I am looking
for a boat to run.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.300
Yeah, in Norway.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.667
...Sig would be the only
Alaskan crabber fishing

21:24.700 --> 21:29.333
red kings, rumored
to sell for $20 a pound.

21:34.967 --> 21:36.634
This year,
we have to adapt,

21:36.667 --> 21:38.200
try different things

21:38.233 --> 21:41.300
and do our best just to try
to make some money.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.800
You know,
this last year has been

22:04.834 --> 22:06.266
one of the hardest
in my entire life.

22:08.166 --> 22:11.000
It's taken a lot of grieving
to accept the losses

22:11.033 --> 22:12.300
of my friends and family.

22:13.734 --> 22:15.333
First we lost, Mahlon Reyes,

22:16.500 --> 22:18.233
then deck boss,
Nick McGlashan.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.500
And now to cap it off,

22:20.533 --> 22:22.166
we stand here today
to remember Todd.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.066
You know,
Todd always had a way

22:27.100 --> 22:29.133
of brightening
a grim situation,

22:29.166 --> 22:31.867
not only with his work ethic,
but with his sense of humor.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.166
He was outsized,

22:35.200 --> 22:36.900
outmuscled,

22:36.934 --> 22:39.000
and he lost the sight
in one of his eyes,

22:39.033 --> 22:40.867
but his heart was bigger
than the man himself.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.433
Thank you for making
a difference in my life

22:45.467 --> 22:48.000
and adding to the spirit
of the Summer Bay.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.166
Rest in peace, buddy.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.066
You know, Todd
was only with us for
a little bit of time,

23:15.100 --> 23:17.367
but he was such
a cool cat, he...

23:17.400 --> 23:19.300
he became part
of the family immediately.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.066
See Rip standing over there.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.834
I can only imagine
what he's going through.

23:28.100 --> 23:31.800
Losing a guy, I've seen it
tear people up before.

23:31.834 --> 23:34.667
I hope he keeps his head high
and sticks it out.

23:35.967 --> 23:37.900
You know, I've,
I've had my share of loss
this year,

23:37.934 --> 23:40.567
but to actually lose somebody

23:40.600 --> 23:42.500
on board that's...

23:42.533 --> 23:44.000
This is undescribable

23:44.033 --> 23:46.233
to lose somebody
under your command.

23:47.967 --> 23:49.333
Eight months ago,

23:49.367 --> 23:51.400
30-year-old Todd Kochutin

23:51.433 --> 23:54.934
perished at sea on the deck
of the Patricia Lee

23:54.967 --> 23:57.000
with Captain Rip Carlton
at the helm.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.533
I just...

24:01.533 --> 24:05.066
just... you just
can't believe it.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.900
You just cannot believe
what's going on.

24:06.934 --> 24:08.900
It's like
the worst dream ever.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.500
That night...

24:15.533 --> 24:17.433
we started stacking,
it was cold.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.567
It was ice fog at that point.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.867
And the pots were going
really slow because
it was hard to see 'em,

24:22.900 --> 24:24.967
and some ice had kind of
come through the area

24:25.000 --> 24:27.433
already that night
and kind of moved them around,

24:27.467 --> 24:29.900
so I had to look around
for 'em, but...

24:29.934 --> 24:31.467
I told the guys last pot...

24:33.400 --> 24:35.066
but for whatever reason...

24:36.634 --> 24:38.567
Todd was in the wrong place...

24:39.700 --> 24:41.333
at the wrong time.

24:44.033 --> 24:46.200
And Todd...

24:46.233 --> 24:48.266
was, um...

24:57.867 --> 24:59.967
He was, um...

25:00.066 --> 25:01.934
he was surrounded
by his family...

25:03.967 --> 25:05.233
and he passed away.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.767
That's a... that's
a tough nut right there,
I tell you.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.433
So...

25:15.200 --> 25:18.567
Patty Lee is a great boat.
It's a safe boat.

25:19.834 --> 25:21.333
Bad things happen
to good people,

25:21.367 --> 25:23.367
and it happened to us.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.033
But...

25:25.066 --> 25:26.467
we just got to work
through it.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.800
Our quota is good

25:29.834 --> 25:31.834
and prices are up,

25:31.867 --> 25:33.300
so we're gonna go after it.

25:35.133 --> 25:38.867
How we honor Todd
is by working even harder
for him.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.133
Let's go.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.266
On the rope!

25:49.066 --> 25:51.500
Well, today is the big day.

25:51.533 --> 25:54.233
We're just getting ready
to go do this golden king crab season.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.333
We're just waiting
on one more crew member.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.333
My older brother, Shane.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.934
Shane and I kind of had
a complicated relationship.

26:15.033 --> 26:19.100
The last time
I was in Dutch Harbor
was 25 years ago,

26:19.133 --> 26:21.233
and I just swore
I'd never come back.

26:23.634 --> 26:25.467
Always ready to work.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.100
I guess we're gonna find out
if he's still got it.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.166
The last time
I was in Dutch Harbor
was 25 years ago...

26:38.266 --> 26:40.266
and I just swore
I'd never come back.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.800
My brother gave me a call

26:44.834 --> 26:46.133
he said he needed my help.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.133
And that's why I'm here.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.734
Being in Dutch Harbor,

27:05.767 --> 27:07.033
I'm thinking of Phil.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.100
The figure
looming large

27:10.133 --> 27:12.900
over brothers Shane and Josh,

27:12.934 --> 27:15.400
legendary captain Phil Harris.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.967
I think that kid
forgets that, uh,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
once upon a time,
I was on deck.

27:19.033 --> 27:21.467
Now you know
why lions eat their young.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.567
He was a role model
to me. He really was.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.100
After my mom
and Phil got a divorce,

27:27.133 --> 27:29.100
I was unable to see
my brothers, which,

27:29.133 --> 27:31.166
you know, I mean,
it broke my heart.
It really did.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.800
And it broke
my brothers' hearts.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.734
No doubt about it.

27:34.767 --> 27:37.333
But, um, now
we're making up for lost time.

27:37.367 --> 27:39.533
Phil always wanted his sons
to work together.

27:41.734 --> 27:43.166
The old Cornelia Marie.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.734
Man.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.433
I mean...

27:48.467 --> 27:51.400
it's kind of crazy to just
be here and look at it here.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.333
Brother Shane.

28:04.734 --> 28:06.867
All right.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.700
Well.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.266
Oh, wow.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.467
This is the place, huh?

28:16.500 --> 28:17.600
This is the place.

28:17.634 --> 28:19.367
Your new home away from home.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.900
Welcome to the industry.

28:20.934 --> 28:22.734
Tell you what, being
around you, though, man,

28:22.767 --> 28:24.667
does take a lot of hard work.

28:24.700 --> 28:27.233
I mean, most brothers,
you know, you can...
you can go play pool

28:27.266 --> 28:30.400
and go have a beer with,
and me, I got to go
on a fishing boat in Alaska.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.266
Well, thanks
for having me, bro.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.900
No, don't thank me yet.

28:34.934 --> 28:36.767
We'll make him proud, man.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.800
Ah, better believe, brother.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.600
- All right.
- You got this.

28:40.634 --> 28:42.500
All right. Well, I guess
I better get to it.

28:42.533 --> 28:45.700
Yeah. Yeah. Go learn
about your new playground.

28:47.333 --> 28:48.634
It's been a while

28:48.667 --> 28:51.800
since I had a family member
on the boat, so...

28:51.834 --> 28:53.934
what better than have
your older brother.

28:53.967 --> 28:55.767
We'll see what he's made of,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.967
what type of Iron Man
he really is.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.567
Hiya. Hello?

29:12.767 --> 29:14.500
Yes.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.233
Oh, is that right?

29:25.967 --> 29:27.233
When is it?

29:31.133 --> 29:33.500
Are you flexible
on dates?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.834
No, I understand completely.

29:39.867 --> 29:41.233
All right. Take it forward.

29:43.066 --> 29:45.066
All right.
I appreciate it.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.400
Okay. Very good.

29:49.734 --> 29:51.300
Well...

29:51.333 --> 29:54.300
the good news
is there's potential
in Norway,

29:54.333 --> 29:56.533
but the problem is the timing.

29:56.567 --> 29:57.867
The crew is here.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.734
I mean, everybody's ready
to go fish bairdi.

30:00.767 --> 30:02.634
And, uh,

30:02.667 --> 30:06.300
we're having a little baby
coming into the world
real soon.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.567
I don't want to miss it.

30:09.734 --> 30:11.567
But I got to go now.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.066
Do you hear me?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.367
Oh, hey.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.233
Uh, well,
it's going all right.

30:25.266 --> 30:26.467
But how are you?

30:31.800 --> 30:33.400
Uh, yeah.

30:33.433 --> 30:36.734
Well, I spoke to Bengt
in Norway,

30:36.767 --> 30:38.166
and he has a boat
that I could fish,

30:38.200 --> 30:40.467
and it would be red king crab.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.634
The only snag
is I got to do it now

30:42.667 --> 30:44.266
because he needs a captain.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.233
And then I would have
to probably do bairdi after,

30:47.266 --> 30:48.767
which I think I can do.

30:50.066 --> 30:52.667
But the other issue is I would
miss the birth of the baby,

30:52.700 --> 30:55.100
which I have promised
the whole time
I would be there for.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.567
Oh.
I mean, of course I want you
to be here.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.233
But it sounds like if you want
to be here for the family,

31:06.266 --> 31:07.533
then you have to go.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.266
If you open up the door there,

31:10.300 --> 31:11.533
that can be good for everyone.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.133
I just feel like
it's a really
good opportunity.

31:21.533 --> 31:23.300
You just
got to go to Norway
and kick ass,

31:23.333 --> 31:25.333
catch crab fast,
come back to Alaska,

31:25.367 --> 31:28.667
catch the bairdi and get
my husband home for the baby.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.800
Yeah, that simple, huh?

31:31.834 --> 31:32.934
Look, I love you.

31:32.967 --> 31:34.667
We're all thinking about you.

31:34.700 --> 31:37.567
And I think you know
what the right thing
to do here is.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.433
All right, Mandy.
Love you too.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.700
All right, guys.

31:47.734 --> 31:49.767
Patricia Lee's got
more crab to catch

31:49.800 --> 31:52.033
than anybody in this fleet.

31:52.066 --> 31:55.834
If you like to work, business
is booming over here.

31:57.266 --> 31:58.533
We're gonna go kick some ass

31:58.567 --> 32:01.200
and take some names
and Todd's name.

32:01.233 --> 32:02.700
Stay safe. We're out.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.967
I need more power
to pull in the line

32:10.000 --> 32:12.166
because I'm long-lining
multiple pots.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.467
Got a pink slip for
for on her now,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.033
we got to catch
some black cods.

32:20.867 --> 32:23.900
You can see we got
a lot of work to do.

32:23.934 --> 32:26.000
We got to get ready for war.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.867
This is the reason
why I'm fighting so hard.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.200
This is... this is
what I'm fighting for

32:33.233 --> 32:35.867
and why we're doing
what we're doing.

32:35.900 --> 32:39.700
This is one of the hardest
seasons we've seen
in the last 25 years,

32:39.734 --> 32:42.133
not just for my boat,
my family,

32:42.166 --> 32:45.166
but for the entire industry.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.233
- Okay, cut her loose, guys.
- Yep.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.800
Whoo!

32:50.667 --> 32:52.634
- We're going fishing.
- Yeah.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.100
Going fishing, baby.

32:54.133 --> 32:55.700
Throw the line.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.467
Yeah!

33:02.433 --> 33:05.066
Gold king crab 2021, baby.

33:07.567 --> 33:08.867
God!

33:09.867 --> 33:11.800
Shane's got that
look in his eye.

33:11.834 --> 33:13.200
What look is that?

33:13.233 --> 33:15.467
It's either a bowel movement
or he's gonna kick some ass.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.900
I'm not quite sure
what it is yet.

33:16.934 --> 33:18.166
We'll find out.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.667
Bill...

33:24.700 --> 33:26.166
you in or out?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.066
I'm going to Homer to get
the boat through the yard.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.700
I'm more worried about my crew
than I am of me right now.

33:33.066 --> 33:36.066
I got a good opportunity
to go to Norway.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.000
It's a once in a lifetime,
I got to take it.

33:40.367 --> 33:42.266
If it works...

33:42.300 --> 33:43.333
let me know.

34:00.934 --> 34:02.567
Before you come out on deck,

34:02.600 --> 34:04.834
- make sure you got that life jacket on.
- Yep.

34:04.867 --> 34:07.200
If you don't, it's a couple
hundred dollar fine.

34:07.233 --> 34:09.033
- All right.
- Stress everybody out.

34:09.066 --> 34:10.533
I wanna save my life too,
so I'll wear it.

34:10.567 --> 34:11.600
Yeah.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.166
For everything else
from here on out,

34:13.200 --> 34:14.400
it's kind of a learning curve.

34:14.433 --> 34:16.033
Trial by fire.

34:16.066 --> 34:18.000
It's about kick some ass,
take some names,

34:18.033 --> 34:19.634
and I think
you're gonna be all right.

34:22.567 --> 34:23.967
- Thanks, guys.
- Yep.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.767
He'll be fine.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.600
190 miles
from Dutch Harbor

34:33.634 --> 34:36.200
on the Pribilof
golden king grounds.

34:36.233 --> 34:38.133
We got to start
setting our first pot.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.500
I have no idea
what I'm doing right now.

34:46.567 --> 34:49.834
Securing a permit
to catch goldens
is one thing...

34:49.867 --> 34:52.033
Chance that
we can lose everything.

34:52.066 --> 34:53.467
We want to produce something.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.934
I mean, we want
to keep this boat alive.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.700
...but for captains
Josh Harris

34:57.734 --> 35:00.400
and Casey McManus
of the Cornelia Marie,

35:00.433 --> 35:02.700
staving off
financial extinction

35:02.734 --> 35:04.967
in waters four times as deep,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.100
well, that's another.

35:06.133 --> 35:07.567
See this spot?
You want to try?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.433
- Yeah. Coming out this--
- A little canyon.

35:09.467 --> 35:10.533
Yeah.

35:18.634 --> 35:20.000
Yeah!

35:20.033 --> 35:21.233
Whoo-hoo!

35:21.266 --> 35:22.767
Here we go, baby!

35:25.166 --> 35:27.734
Joining the quest
for golden king crab

35:27.767 --> 35:29.100
just seven miles away...

35:29.133 --> 35:30.433
Yeah, baby.

35:32.367 --> 35:33.867
...on the Time Bandit...

35:38.266 --> 35:39.967
Most of the quota gets caught

35:40.000 --> 35:42.300
on the northwest side
of the mushroom.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.734
They call it the mushroom.

35:46.066 --> 35:48.433
It's very critical
I find something.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.166
We've already lost
the revenue of the red crab.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.533
I have no money.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.800
...Captain Jonathan
bets the last of his savings

35:54.834 --> 35:57.634
that he can spin goldens

35:57.667 --> 35:59.133
into gold.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.100
We just
can't afford any mistakes.

36:01.133 --> 36:02.166
Roger.

36:07.834 --> 36:11.667
Trading the deep
for the beach.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.734
Hurry up.

36:13.934 --> 36:16.066
Got some, baby. Whoo!

36:18.767 --> 36:21.033
If something
goes wrong,

36:21.066 --> 36:23.667
the swells are gonna
push us on the rocks.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.700
Captain Shawn
fires off a 400-pot salvo

36:26.734 --> 36:30.500
into the shallows that
the Dungeness crab favor.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.333
Baby and a wife at home.

36:32.367 --> 36:34.634
I better start
catching some crab,

36:34.667 --> 36:37.433
'cause if I'm up here
not making any money,

36:37.467 --> 36:39.200
I don't know how long
I'll be able to do it.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.800
And on the Aleutian
golden king grounds...

36:43.834 --> 36:45.266
Smells like money, baby.

36:47.133 --> 36:48.300
Whoo!

36:52.667 --> 36:55.667
That starboard side's
maybe getting hammered,

36:55.700 --> 36:56.967
so be advised.

37:01.500 --> 37:05.300
We have about 1.5 million
pounds of quota to catch.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.500
That's a lot of crab.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.600
I'm hoping I land it
right on the edge,

37:11.634 --> 37:14.066
because those crab
move up and down that cliff

37:14.100 --> 37:15.634
and they sit and they feed,

37:15.667 --> 37:18.533
so big risk, big reward.

37:18.567 --> 37:21.300
Captain Rick Carlton
shells off pots

37:21.333 --> 37:23.200
directly over a steep drop

37:23.233 --> 37:26.000
in the sea floor
where he looks to snag

37:26.033 --> 37:30.266
a fleet leading
$21 million quota.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.800
Ready to go.

37:32.967 --> 37:35.233
All right, send it over, boys.

37:35.266 --> 37:36.867
Here we go.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.667
Whoo!

37:38.700 --> 37:40.333
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

37:43.066 --> 37:45.000
It's happening.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.300
We can do this.

37:50.567 --> 37:51.900
Whoo!

38:00.200 --> 38:03.867
For every 90 seconds, you
get a pot and they're coming.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.433
If something goes wrong,

38:05.467 --> 38:07.867
gonna hit
the fan in a hurry.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.667
Longline fishing
connects pots

38:12.700 --> 38:14.433
to a single line that runs

38:14.467 --> 38:16.700
the length
of the entire string,

38:16.734 --> 38:19.166
anchoring the gear
to the ocean floor,

38:19.200 --> 38:21.834
allowing sets to cover canyons

38:21.867 --> 38:24.266
and underwater ridges.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.634
Whoo!

38:40.133 --> 38:41.166
Ahhh.

38:44.967 --> 38:46.100
Oh, no.

38:46.133 --> 38:47.867
No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.166
Oh, no.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.700
Guy's give me
a heart attack.

39:08.033 --> 39:09.600
With the boat
at full speed,

39:10.867 --> 39:13.700
the anchor pot
jams against the rail.

39:16.233 --> 39:19.233
Deckhand Cameron Meyers
steps in to free it,

39:19.266 --> 39:21.700
but the tension
releases first,

39:21.734 --> 39:24.233
allowing the pot
to slide back...

39:25.967 --> 39:28.033
nearly crushing
the crewman's leg.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
You got that 2,000 pound
pot there,

39:31.433 --> 39:33.967
but the whole string
is pulling it out

39:34.000 --> 39:35.300
and the tension will build,

39:35.333 --> 39:37.533
you know, when it's pulled out
one way or the other.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.700
Anything that an anchor pot
hits is gonna get hurt.

39:43.734 --> 39:45.200
Hmm, we don't want that.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.867
You know, I will do
everything in my power
to make it home safely.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.800
That's a big wave.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.367
What the [bleep]?

40:07.400 --> 40:09.533
Slow down.

40:09.567 --> 40:10.867
Big one, big one, big one.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.166
Oh, no.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.133
Oh, no. No!

40:30.634 --> 40:32.266
You got me?

40:32.300 --> 40:33.500
Is Kyle okay?

40:40.934 --> 40:42.000
Okay.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.900
What the [bleep]? Damn it.

40:46.634 --> 40:47.967
Oh, man.

40:49.934 --> 40:51.200
What a start.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.867
3,900 miles
northwest of Dutch Harbor

41:00.900 --> 41:02.367
in Tromso, Norway.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.567
You know, uh...

41:24.567 --> 41:26.634
this is where
my grandfather was fishing

41:26.667 --> 41:29.133
and father before him
and my dad.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.066
And now I'm chasing
them right back

41:32.100 --> 41:33.200
to where they started from.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.100
It's mind boggling to me.

41:51.066 --> 41:53.233
I'm meeting a boat owner.
His name is Bengt

41:53.266 --> 41:56.266
and he's lined up a boat
that I can potentially use.

42:04.634 --> 42:06.600
There's a lot of risk here because

42:06.634 --> 42:07.967
you're in the unknown

42:08.000 --> 42:11.433
and the fishery here,
it's a derby.

42:11.467 --> 42:13.400
Nothing's guaranteed.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.266
But whether it's fate

42:15.300 --> 42:16.967
or whatever's driving this,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.700
uh, I just got to go
with my gut...

42:19.734 --> 42:23.634
because, uh, my family,
they've forged
their names here.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.667
And I want to see
what I can do myself.

42:28.667 --> 42:30.133
Now hopefully,
this will work out.

42:47.634 --> 42:49.066
There he is.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.900
Hello.

42:50.934 --> 42:52.100
Good to see you.

42:52.133 --> 42:53.967
Yeah, it's only been 15 years.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.266
- Um, maybe. Maybe more.
- Something.

42:56.300 --> 42:57.400
Maybe more.

42:58.567 --> 42:59.834
Ahhh!

42:59.867 --> 43:01.900
- So this is the boat, huh?
- Yeah, come on.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.934
Oh, wow.

43:06.033 --> 43:07.433
That's a big cafeteria.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.967
How many horsepower?

43:11.200 --> 43:13.166
- 2,200 horse.
- 2,200.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.667
After nearly 40 years

43:16.700 --> 43:20.033
patrolling the Barents Sea for
the Norwegian Coast Guard...

43:20.066 --> 43:23.667
It's beautiful, but
where are we gonna put
the crab on this thing?

43:26.400 --> 43:28.133
But you don't have
circulating water here.

43:28.166 --> 43:31.000
Nothing. Nothing.
Only dry.

43:31.033 --> 43:32.700
That can change.

43:32.734 --> 43:34.600
...Captain Sig must convert

43:34.634 --> 43:39.967
the 193-foot Stalbas
from a cutter to a crabber.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.500
So, this is not a very
typical deck to me.

43:44.533 --> 43:47.700
- Um, we don't have a rack, you know, a launcher.
- Yeah.

43:48.967 --> 43:51.066
That block...

43:51.100 --> 43:52.233
does that thing run?

43:56.567 --> 43:57.900
I need to see that run.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.567
I noticed this rail.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.166
The last thing
we want is a 800-pound pot

44:04.200 --> 44:07.500
smashing these vents,
so can we do another railing?

44:07.533 --> 44:10.166
You know, maybe...
maybe inside here.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.400
Yeah.

44:13.133 --> 44:15.367
You know,
this is, this is not a, uh,

44:15.400 --> 44:17.867
a crab boat yet, at least.

44:17.900 --> 44:20.800
And this is on very
short notice.

44:20.834 --> 44:21.934
- Yeah.
- Everything.

44:24.634 --> 44:27.100
How about time on...
on this project?
What do you think?

44:28.233 --> 44:29.734
How much time do we not have?

44:31.767 --> 44:32.834
Normally...

44:33.867 --> 44:35.567
two or three working days,

44:35.600 --> 44:37.400
I would say
we can make it in...

44:39.000 --> 44:40.500
one and a half, two days

44:40.533 --> 44:43.233
if we can get some extra hand
for welding.

44:44.533 --> 44:45.700
Time's ticking.

44:45.734 --> 44:47.200
My daughter's having a baby

44:47.233 --> 44:49.500
and I'd like to be home
for that if I can make it.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.500
I think we can do this.

44:52.533 --> 44:53.667
I think we have to.

44:54.767 --> 44:56.300
So...

45:03.934 --> 45:05.667
This boat
is not a crab boat...

45:06.767 --> 45:08.600
and, uh,

45:08.634 --> 45:10.867
it's gonna take a little bit
to get this thing to work.

45:15.300 --> 45:18.834
It's not just about
the launcher and that deck

45:18.867 --> 45:20.333
and the gear.

45:20.367 --> 45:22.166
We need a crew

45:22.200 --> 45:24.266
and we are starting
from ground zero.

45:26.333 --> 45:28.367
3,700 miles southeast...

45:31.233 --> 45:33.700
on the Pribilof
golden crab grounds...

45:36.500 --> 45:38.533
Finally we get
to go check out these pots...

45:39.533 --> 45:40.834
see how these things did.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.800
A lot of work to get
those things out there.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.266
Finally, I want
to see a payoff.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.433
...aboard
the Cornelia Marie...

45:50.533 --> 45:52.000
Go to get out of here
and find them, man.

45:52.033 --> 45:53.300
Let's get a little sniff.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.367
It's all it takes.

45:55.400 --> 45:58.500
Show me the money.

45:58.533 --> 46:01.300
With $800,000
needed to replace

46:01.333 --> 46:03.333
their annual red king haul,

46:03.367 --> 46:06.333
captains Josh
and Casey go for the gold.

46:06.367 --> 46:10.166
57,000 pounds of it,
to be precise.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.967
This is a pretty deep string,

46:12.000 --> 46:13.567
240 fathoms.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.934
I mean, we only got 40 pots.

46:16.967 --> 46:19.834
We have to make each one
of these little guys count.

46:19.867 --> 46:21.600
40 bullets in this gun.

46:22.767 --> 46:25.934
40 bullets, you got to kill
as many zombies as you can.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.100
I'm not
seeing anything.

46:48.800 --> 46:49.800
Oh-oh.

46:50.934 --> 46:52.400
Can't find the damn thing.

46:56.033 --> 46:58.867
They... may have
lost the pot. I don't know.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.133
We'll stay positive.

47:02.233 --> 47:03.533
Maybe we just missed it.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.634
You're seeing that
second pot, Josh?

47:11.567 --> 47:13.734
No. I'm not seeing it.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.934
It should be right here.

47:18.266 --> 47:21.166
I don't see
a single pot around me.

47:22.533 --> 47:23.834
I think we lost this one.

47:28.066 --> 47:29.333
Something's up.

47:30.867 --> 47:32.000
None of it's here.

47:33.333 --> 47:34.533
Set it too deep?

47:34.567 --> 47:36.200
It's gone, dude. I don't know.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.934
Son of a bitch.

47:41.133 --> 47:42.400
Ten pots.

47:42.433 --> 47:45.033
25% of our year, right there.

47:48.367 --> 47:50.333
If we lose these,

47:50.367 --> 47:51.800
man, it's game over.

47:53.233 --> 47:55.033
Well, maybe
we should call Johnny.

47:56.934 --> 47:58.033
Yeah.

47:58.066 --> 47:59.734
We need all the help
we can get, right now.

48:04.967 --> 48:06.166
What's up, Josh?

48:09.300 --> 48:12.133
Oh, man, I'm... I'm just
grinding, you know?

48:12.166 --> 48:14.734
I haven't seen
anything great yet.

48:14.767 --> 48:17.600
How's it going over there
for you guys?

48:29.133 --> 48:30.533
Have you got any ideas?

48:34.166 --> 48:37.200
How
deep did you set up and how
long were your lines?

48:37.233 --> 48:39.500
We have
200 on each pot.

48:39.533 --> 48:41.266
That current was ripping
the other night.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.200
It was ripping south.

48:43.233 --> 48:45.266
It might be like two-tenths
a mile off your mark,

48:45.300 --> 48:48.200
and then they'll all still be
in a solid,
straight string

48:48.233 --> 48:49.333
but the buoys will be down.

48:50.900 --> 48:51.934
Ay, ay, ay.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.367
You could drag for it,

48:54.400 --> 48:55.700
but, you know,
that's gonna be tough.

48:55.734 --> 48:57.100
It's like a needle
in a haystack.

49:03.367 --> 49:05.900
What do you...
what do you mean?

49:08.533 --> 49:10.734
a line between
your boat and my boat,

49:10.767 --> 49:12.533
and then we've had
a hook in the middle.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.533
And any pots that were there
that we drag it over,

49:24.567 --> 49:26.533
we should be able to get back.

49:28.900 --> 49:30.567
What'd you think?
What you told me

49:30.600 --> 49:31.800
is you just
came up with a plan

49:31.834 --> 49:33.634
to save your pots
with my boat?

49:38.834 --> 49:41.033
- Our boats.
- Both of our boats.

49:41.066 --> 49:42.300
To save your pots.

49:44.033 --> 49:45.800
What the...

49:45.834 --> 49:48.100
I'll try it with you.
I'll try it.

49:48.133 --> 49:50.500
- All right, dude.
- We'll be seeing you soon, buddy.

49:50.533 --> 49:52.667
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.967
Dude, you really
do think this is gonna
work, don't you?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.433
We got to get
this thing going.

49:58.467 --> 50:01.100
'Cause we ain't making money
doing what we're doing
right now.

50:03.734 --> 50:06.467
178 miles southeast

50:06.500 --> 50:08.133
on the black cod grounds...

50:17.100 --> 50:18.800
you got to watch
that leg.

50:18.834 --> 50:20.033
...aboard the Saga.

50:21.800 --> 50:22.867
One mile.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.900
This is not ideal conditions

50:27.934 --> 50:30.333
to be setting a longline
here for your first time.

50:30.367 --> 50:32.100
This is stupid.

50:32.133 --> 50:33.200
But I have to.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.900
With his deck
overhauls a longline

50:38.934 --> 50:41.533
the southern depths
for black cod.

50:41.567 --> 50:44.634
Told you. Not only
are our job's on the line,

50:44.667 --> 50:46.567
they've put his pink slip up.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.166
We're both on the line.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.567
do it or don't.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.867
Captain Jake
joins the hunt

50:52.900 --> 50:54.634
for a new species of his own.

50:54.667 --> 50:56.433
So I'm gonna start
long-lining right now

50:56.467 --> 50:58.166
and the main reason is

50:58.200 --> 51:00.533
you can see,
see these cliff sides,

51:00.567 --> 51:03.333
I need some weight
to hold the pots

51:03.367 --> 51:05.033
on the mountainside

51:05.066 --> 51:08.166
and be able to get
to the depths that I want to

51:08.200 --> 51:10.200
without losing
the gear entirely.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.166
Going over here.
Watch your feet.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.433
Don't fall in.

51:22.634 --> 51:23.800
Whoo!

51:25.867 --> 51:27.967
First pot's overboard.

51:33.734 --> 51:35.734
Damn it, Mac.

51:35.767 --> 51:37.233
Hurry up.

51:37.266 --> 51:38.467
Oh,

51:44.033 --> 51:46.266
Mac, what the [bleep]?

51:54.367 --> 51:55.500
On the Saga...

52:01.667 --> 52:03.934
Mac, what the [bleep]?

52:06.634 --> 52:08.500
Mac didn't set the pot
in time and...

52:08.533 --> 52:11.634
uh, pot caught the roller,
it ripped the roller
right off the boat.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.867
Not good.

52:15.567 --> 52:17.367
Failing to raise
the launcher,

52:17.400 --> 52:21.266
2,000 pounds of already set
longline gear

52:21.300 --> 52:24.333
does what
the hydro man does not,

52:24.367 --> 52:26.600
pull the pot into the sea,

52:26.634 --> 52:29.300
tearing the machine
rounded line guide

52:29.333 --> 52:32.100
or roller
off the starboard rail.

52:36.700 --> 52:40.800
Now I got to stop
because I can't set.

52:40.834 --> 52:42.567
I don't have another roller.

52:46.033 --> 52:48.166
Then you have to weld
the pipe.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.967
I'm pissed.

52:51.800 --> 52:55.700
I got to try to modify it,
see if we can fix it.

52:55.734 --> 52:57.667
I just want to catch fish.

52:57.700 --> 52:59.900
If I lose...

52:59.934 --> 53:01.066
I lose the boat.

53:03.967 --> 53:05.667
Things happen
on a boat, you know?

53:05.700 --> 53:06.867
And, and I feel bad.

53:06.900 --> 53:08.634
Yeah, I do, man. It's...

53:08.667 --> 53:10.967
Hit the wrong lever, man.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.500
Instead of going up,
I went down a little bit.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.266
Let it go.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
It went like a car.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.767
...everybody jumps on it.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.767
I've got nothing else
to fish.

53:42.367 --> 53:44.934
It's the only choice
I've gotten.

53:44.967 --> 53:47.100
Whoo!

53:47.133 --> 53:48.667
Now it's survival.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.033
3,900 miles northwest...

53:58.500 --> 54:00.700
...just outside
Tromso, Norway.

54:04.066 --> 54:05.767
Ooh.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.700
There!

54:07.734 --> 54:08.834
Down there.

54:12.767 --> 54:14.600
It's tight.

54:14.634 --> 54:16.000
We're fine on this end.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.166
This is the end
that's scary because,

54:19.200 --> 54:20.734
you know, when
you're landing the gear...

54:23.166 --> 54:25.200
and then, uh, any swing...

54:26.600 --> 54:28.033
Right?

54:28.066 --> 54:31.066
So, whoever's on the back
of the pot's really gonna
have to understand,

54:31.100 --> 54:32.767
uh...

54:32.800 --> 54:34.433
how to get out of the way.

54:34.467 --> 54:37.967
I have a feeling
there's gonna be
a lot of this going on,

54:38.000 --> 54:39.033
which is fine.

54:39.066 --> 54:41.767
With Mandy's due date
just weeks away,

54:41.800 --> 54:44.233
Captain Sig
and an army of locals

54:44.266 --> 54:47.734
race the clock
to convert Stalbas

54:47.767 --> 54:49.433
into a crab boat.

54:51.934 --> 54:52.967
Wow.

54:54.467 --> 54:56.734
But his new
renovated vessel

54:56.767 --> 54:59.967
won't be of much use
without a spot to fish.

55:00.066 --> 55:03.100
Russia is on this side, right?

55:03.133 --> 55:04.533
That's Russian border?

55:07.533 --> 55:10.900
So anything west of this line
is free zone, right?

55:10.934 --> 55:12.834
- Yes.
- This is free.

55:12.867 --> 55:15.000
At $20 a pound, U.S.

55:15.033 --> 55:18.166
Can you imagine
if that area has crab now?

55:18.200 --> 55:19.600
Yep.

55:19.634 --> 55:20.967
And nobody's
been fishing here?

55:25.233 --> 55:26.500
I mean...

55:29.400 --> 55:30.967
I mean...

55:33.133 --> 55:34.400
Is he, uh, close to you?

55:34.433 --> 55:37.800
Can you call him
and see if we can get
a little information?

55:37.834 --> 55:39.500
Most crabbers in Norway

55:39.533 --> 55:42.433
stay within
the protection of the fjords.

55:42.467 --> 55:44.000
- Hello.
- Hey, Gunnar.

55:45.600 --> 55:48.000
Uh, I have Sig here,
can we go over,

55:48.033 --> 55:49.700
switch over to English?

55:49.734 --> 55:53.066
But Sig has his eyes
on a bigger prize,

55:53.100 --> 55:55.667
offshore in open water.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.900
Hello, Gunnar.

55:58.266 --> 56:00.734
So, I guess you tried to fish

56:00.767 --> 56:03.033
out west of the line
and out deep.

56:03.066 --> 56:04.600
Is that right?

56:06.166 --> 56:09.000
Was it five years ago
you were out there?

56:20.000 --> 56:21.133
Right.

56:24.533 --> 56:27.433
Looking at this chart,
if you stay in the...

56:27.467 --> 56:29.467
let's say right below
300 meters

56:29.500 --> 56:31.200
or something like that,
is that doable?

56:38.834 --> 56:40.000
Uh, thanks a lot, Gunnar.

56:40.033 --> 56:41.533
I really appreciate.

56:41.567 --> 56:42.734
Yeah.

56:45.133 --> 56:47.834
So from what,
Gunnar was saying,

56:47.867 --> 56:49.867
I really want to start...

56:49.900 --> 56:51.200
right on this bank here.

56:51.233 --> 56:53.367
- See it?
- Yeah.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.567
It sounds like everybody has
been fishing in this fjord,

56:55.600 --> 56:57.100
so if nobody's
been fishing outside,

56:57.133 --> 56:58.233
and that's where I want to go.

57:00.233 --> 57:01.734
Is it gonna work?

57:01.767 --> 57:02.800
We'll see.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.600
3,800 miles southeast

57:08.634 --> 57:10.667
and just 300 yards
from shore...

57:13.266 --> 57:15.100
Okay, boys,
we're starting it up here,

57:15.133 --> 57:17.200
so we're gonna pull up
on this first one.

57:17.233 --> 57:18.900
...on the Dungeness
crab grounds.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.266
We're now
in the middle of the ocean.

57:21.300 --> 57:23.266
We're right up
next to the beach

57:23.300 --> 57:25.467
it's about four fathoms
of water right now.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.800
And it's risky.

57:29.600 --> 57:32.967
Captain Sean Dwyer
creeps up to his first pot,

57:33.000 --> 57:34.600
the volcanic ocean floor

57:34.634 --> 57:37.300
rising quickly
toward his keel.

57:37.333 --> 57:40.734
Pretty dangerous,
either we're gonna lose pots.

57:40.767 --> 57:42.734
You never know
what's underneath the water.

57:47.266 --> 57:51.166
Starts in 40 fathoms,
runs all the way up to
about 5 fathoms,

57:51.200 --> 57:54.900
so I got to concentrate
on how the heck
I'm gonna do this.

57:54.934 --> 57:57.900
We just give it a shot
and see what happens.

57:57.934 --> 58:00.333
The 200-ton Elinore J

58:00.367 --> 58:03.266
draws ten feet below
the water's surface.

58:03.300 --> 58:04.734
Sean's challenge,

58:04.767 --> 58:06.767
keep the boat
from running aground

58:06.800 --> 58:08.300
on day one of fishing.

58:08.333 --> 58:10.467
And it's... it's a gamble.
There's no doubt about it.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.967
But...

58:12.000 --> 58:14.233
you got to adapt and...

58:14.266 --> 58:16.900
I just... hope
there's money in this thing.

58:17.934 --> 58:19.967
First pot coming up.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.400
We need to see the crab.
Oh, yeah, boys.

58:25.467 --> 58:26.867
Yeah.

58:26.900 --> 58:28.834
Whoo!

58:36.900 --> 58:38.834
Whoo!

58:42.600 --> 58:44.000
Oh, yeah, buddy.

58:45.900 --> 58:47.700
Oh, baby. Come to papa.

58:51.300 --> 58:52.433
Hey, what the

58:54.033 --> 58:56.433
What the [bleep]?

58:56.467 --> 58:57.900
Zack?

58:57.934 --> 58:59.834
Get the flashlights
up to work.

59:06.834 --> 59:08.934
We have no power.

59:08.967 --> 59:10.433
I got no lights, no steering,

59:10.467 --> 59:12.200
all I got is forward
and reverse.

59:14.567 --> 59:16.266
A pot in the water
behind me here.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.367
What the was that?

59:28.834 --> 59:30.000
Oh, my God.

59:37.233 --> 59:39.367
We got no power.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.900
I got no lights, no steering.

59:40.934 --> 59:43.367
All I got is forward
and reverse.

59:50.300 --> 59:51.367
Let me get
to a position

59:51.400 --> 59:53.533
where I can put this thing
in gear

59:53.567 --> 59:55.166
and drive away from the beach.

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:04.634
Well, only five degrees, yeah.

1:00:06.066 --> 1:00:07.967
Yeah, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:11.433
Ah.

1:00:11.467 --> 1:00:13.100
this.

1:00:13.133 --> 1:00:14.700
Tell him we need
to set the anchor.

1:00:14.734 --> 1:00:15.867
All right.

1:00:17.133 --> 1:00:18.333
Line's off.

1:00:27.734 --> 1:00:29.033
I got to get
that anchor down

1:00:29.066 --> 1:00:31.634
so I could stop drifting
towards the beach.

1:00:31.667 --> 1:00:33.767
When you're ready. Go ahead.

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:41.700
Just give me
all the chain out.

1:00:50.867 --> 1:00:51.934
That's all we got, man.

1:00:51.967 --> 1:00:53.033
That's the emergency brake.

1:00:58.066 --> 1:01:00.333
Zack, what's going on
down there, man?

1:01:13.133 --> 1:01:14.767
Give me
some lights, bud.

1:01:16.233 --> 1:01:17.467
Give me some lights.

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:18.567
Yeah, buddy.

1:01:20.433 --> 1:01:24.734
Well, this top of this brake
board for our generators,

1:01:24.767 --> 1:01:26.900
but it was cracked
all the way through.

1:01:26.934 --> 1:01:28.400
yeah.

1:01:28.433 --> 1:01:29.700
I mean, that's,
that's enough...

1:01:29.734 --> 1:01:31.934
That's enough to kill
an engine right there
for sure.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:36.100
All right, we'll get
that other one fired up
for you, Sean.

1:01:38.467 --> 1:01:41.467
Just threw
the parking brake out, man.

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:43.233
I've never had
to do that before.

1:01:43.266 --> 1:01:45.066
I mean,
you're in the Bering Sea,

1:01:45.100 --> 1:01:47.934
you got... 200 miles
to the beach,

1:01:47.967 --> 1:01:49.266
not 200 yards.

1:01:56.767 --> 1:01:58.400
That was...
that was sketchy as hell.

1:01:58.433 --> 1:02:00.367
We were so close
to the shore.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:02.100
I don't, uh,

1:02:02.133 --> 1:02:05.567
I don't really want to do
that again or ever.

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:06.700
So, yeah.

1:02:13.767 --> 1:02:15.367
87 miles west...

1:02:18.166 --> 1:02:20.834
All right, I've got
three strings that
are longlines.

1:02:22.066 --> 1:02:23.867
...on the Saga.

1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:27.734
It's so new to me.
It just scares the living crap
out of me.

1:02:35.367 --> 1:02:37.667
His first time
fishing black cod

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:39.667
and his first time
long lining,

1:02:39.700 --> 1:02:44.133
Captain Jake must make
his new operation work
for him.

1:02:44.166 --> 1:02:47.133
I gave up my pink slip
to get black cod.

1:02:47.166 --> 1:02:49.033
It's hard not to feel
a sense of panic

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.300
and helplessness.

1:02:52.834 --> 1:02:55.500
Or else
see it start working

1:02:55.533 --> 1:02:58.266
for new owner,
Captain Sean Dwyer.

1:03:02.266 --> 1:03:03.967
It's my third cigarette already.

1:03:05.667 --> 1:03:06.834
In a row.

1:03:11.567 --> 1:03:12.800
All right.

1:03:19.033 --> 1:03:20.166
First pot.

1:03:22.567 --> 1:03:25.467
This is 200 plus fathoms.

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:28.533
I hung it right
on the edge of the cliff.

1:03:28.567 --> 1:03:30.634
I'm hoping to get a steady

1:03:30.667 --> 1:03:34.800
35 average plus
on these strings.

1:03:34.834 --> 1:03:37.133
Let's find out right now.

1:03:37.166 --> 1:03:38.634
Nice and easy.

1:03:38.667 --> 1:03:41.233
All right. It's all you.

1:03:41.266 --> 1:03:42.367
Got it.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:52.300
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1:03:52.333 --> 1:03:53.500
Yeah!

1:03:53.533 --> 1:03:55.867
Oh, my God! Yeah!

1:04:03.133 --> 1:04:04.467
Whoo!

1:04:06.433 --> 1:04:09.600
Oh, my God, Mason.

1:04:13.834 --> 1:04:15.834
Oh, yeah.

1:04:21.567 --> 1:04:23.133
Look at my face.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.500
At $5.50 a pound,

1:04:31.533 --> 1:04:35.233
a good black cod pot
fetches 2,000 bucks.

1:04:35.266 --> 1:04:37.333
Jake smashes that number

1:04:37.367 --> 1:04:40.300
with $5,000
right out of the gate.

1:04:44.033 --> 1:04:45.734
Come on, baby. Come on.

1:04:47.734 --> 1:04:50.033
Whoo-hoo!

1:04:50.066 --> 1:04:52.233
Oh, my God!

1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:54.867
Whoo!

1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:56.834
Yeah, absolutely good
right there.

1:04:56.867 --> 1:04:58.767
What, do you think
there's a hundred in there?

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:03.667
That is a lot of cod.

1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:04.767
Whoo!

1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:09.600
168. Are you crazy?

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:13.533
168 black cod.

1:05:13.567 --> 1:05:14.734
Damn!

1:05:14.767 --> 1:05:16.867
We're in the right area.
Thank you, Jake.

1:05:16.900 --> 1:05:18.166
Thank you.

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:19.934
That's what we're fishing for.

1:05:19.967 --> 1:05:21.367
Bam, baby!

1:05:22.467 --> 1:05:23.600
Told you.

1:05:23.634 --> 1:05:26.900
I ain't giving away my podium.
stupid?

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:33.233
242 miles southwest

1:05:33.266 --> 1:05:34.967
on the golden crab grounds.

1:05:41.734 --> 1:05:42.934
Whoo!

1:05:52.467 --> 1:05:54.667
Aboard
the Patricia Lee.

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:58.100
I really like
this corner right here.

1:05:58.133 --> 1:06:00.400
We call this right here,

1:06:00.433 --> 1:06:02.867
the wavy lays because it,

1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:04.800
it, it looks like potato chips
down there.

1:06:04.834 --> 1:06:06.834
It's really,
it's a strange bottom,

1:06:06.867 --> 1:06:08.967
but they like
to hang out there.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.800
And once we find the band
they're in,

1:06:12.100 --> 1:06:13.734
we're gonna put the hurt
on them.

1:06:18.467 --> 1:06:20.934
Oh,

1:06:20.967 --> 1:06:22.634
I don't like
this weather though,

1:06:22.667 --> 1:06:24.467
the way it's building,

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.500
'cause we're gonna be
up on the ridge

1:06:26.533 --> 1:06:29.767
and the current
rips across this thing.

1:06:30.934 --> 1:06:32.033
I don't like that.

1:06:34.300 --> 1:06:36.634
His first set
spread 21 miles

1:06:36.667 --> 1:06:39.033
over an undulating
sea floor...

1:06:39.066 --> 1:06:41.100
Coming up.

1:06:41.133 --> 1:06:42.800
All right,
this is no joke, guys.

1:06:42.834 --> 1:06:44.000
You gotta have
your together.

1:06:44.033 --> 1:06:46.800
...Captain Rip
fights three knot currents

1:06:46.834 --> 1:06:48.300
and 20-foot seas

1:06:48.333 --> 1:06:50.667
to retrieve his 40 pots,

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:53.567
all tethered
to a single ground line.

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:55.367
There's first one.

1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:56.734
Oh, boy.

1:07:02.700 --> 1:07:04.200
Hell, yeah!

1:07:10.233 --> 1:07:13.734
If you get the line
on the wrong side, not good.

1:07:13.767 --> 1:07:16.367
You'll get it tangled,
sheared off.

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:18.400
But we can do this.

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:32.867
Pay attention.

1:07:34.266 --> 1:07:36.333
Head on a swivel.

1:07:36.367 --> 1:07:37.467
Come on.

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:39.433
All right.

1:07:39.467 --> 1:07:40.667
Whoo!

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:44.867
Whoa!

1:07:46.333 --> 1:07:47.834
Good, good.

1:07:47.867 --> 1:07:50.133
That's some crab.

1:07:50.166 --> 1:07:52.367
Whoo!

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:54.000
All big.

1:07:54.033 --> 1:07:55.433
They're big crab.

1:07:57.133 --> 1:07:58.333
Good start.

1:08:02.634 --> 1:08:04.967
Fishing looks good

1:08:16.533 --> 1:08:18.166
I got it hooked,
I got it hooked.

1:08:19.233 --> 1:08:21.000
Ah, it's gonna slide.

1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:24.433
Oh! Hook, hook, hook.

1:08:34.333 --> 1:08:36.467
You don't want to get hit
with one of those.

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:38.000
Hold him.

1:08:43.567 --> 1:08:46.433
Now we got
the second one in the block.

1:08:46.467 --> 1:08:48.500
You guys trying to give me
a heart attack?

1:09:03.734 --> 1:09:06.166
Stop! Stop!

1:09:07.934 --> 1:09:09.433
Did we just
lose that thing?

1:09:09.467 --> 1:09:10.967
Did we just part that?

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.800
Yeah.

1:09:12.834 --> 1:09:13.934
Damn it.

1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:23.834
Damn it.

1:09:23.867 --> 1:09:26.533
It's in 350 fathoms.

1:09:26.567 --> 1:09:28.033
I didn't need this.

1:09:28.066 --> 1:09:29.266
We don't need this.

1:09:33.934 --> 1:09:36.634
Now we got
the the second one
in the block.

1:09:36.667 --> 1:09:38.133
On the Patricia Lee...

1:09:52.533 --> 1:09:54.433
...hauling
in a building sea...

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.433
Captain Rip Carlton's
ground line...

1:10:00.467 --> 1:10:01.667
snaps.

1:10:04.333 --> 1:10:06.567
So now we got to go
to the other end...

1:10:07.634 --> 1:10:10.634
and haul from the other end.

1:10:10.667 --> 1:10:13.033
And unlike
single pot fishing,

1:10:13.066 --> 1:10:15.934
where a severed line
means one lost pot...

1:10:15.967 --> 1:10:18.100
Oh, Lord.

1:10:18.133 --> 1:10:21.467
...the skipper faces
the loss of an entire string.

1:10:21.500 --> 1:10:23.100
We got one more try,

1:10:23.133 --> 1:10:25.967
and it's 20 miles away,
we'll be back in the tide,

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.467
so it'll be a three-hour run.

1:10:29.166 --> 1:10:32.433
Hopefully, we get that out
without parting it

1:10:32.467 --> 1:10:36.333
because if we part it,
we're screwed.

1:10:36.367 --> 1:10:38.600
We'll go see if we can
find the other end and,

1:10:38.634 --> 1:10:40.100
uh, we'll go from there.

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:43.400
Unbelievable.

1:10:44.634 --> 1:10:47.433
Everything
that could go wrong...

1:10:47.467 --> 1:10:49.700
has gone wrong.

1:10:49.734 --> 1:10:51.467
We got crab though.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:54.600
254 miles northeast

1:10:54.634 --> 1:10:57.066
on the Pribilof
golden crab grounds.

1:11:00.734 --> 1:11:02.133
Think it's gonna work?

1:11:02.166 --> 1:11:05.467
I don't know.
I... I think the odds
are pretty low, but...

1:11:07.300 --> 1:11:10.166
It is a big hook,
it'll grab something. Um...

1:11:11.634 --> 1:11:13.200
...aboard
the Cornelia Marie.

1:11:15.133 --> 1:11:16.967
Cay, she's ready.

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.433
Okay, good.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.333
The task for the boys
just went made of gravel
for our last year.

1:11:23.367 --> 1:11:25.800
We have a lot riding
on them, so

1:11:25.834 --> 1:11:27.967
hopefully we can pull
a rabbit out of the hat,

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.233
but, uh, we'll see.

1:11:31.266 --> 1:11:33.800
After losing
a quarter of their gear

1:11:33.834 --> 1:11:35.967
to the 1,500-foot depths...

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000
John, John? John, John?
What's going on, bud?

1:11:39.033 --> 1:11:40.967
...captains
Josh and Casey

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.100
call in an assist
from the pirate king.

1:11:44.133 --> 1:11:45.266
Hang in there, buddy.

1:11:45.300 --> 1:11:48.266
Let's do this thing.
I, I got your idea.

1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:49.500
I see
what you're talking about.

1:11:49.533 --> 1:11:51.066
I think it's gonna work.

1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:54.033
The plan, attach
a line between the vessels,

1:11:54.066 --> 1:11:56.800
then lower a massive
grapple hook

1:11:56.834 --> 1:11:58.967
from the middle into the deep.

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.333
As the boats steam ahead
in tandem,

1:12:01.367 --> 1:12:04.100
the giant V-shaped dragline

1:12:04.133 --> 1:12:07.133
will comb the pots'
suspected location,

1:12:07.166 --> 1:12:09.400
snagging the sunken bags

1:12:09.433 --> 1:12:10.867
and retrieving the gear.

1:12:14.867 --> 1:12:18.000
Just gonna shoot some line
across your deck,
so watch out.

1:12:20.133 --> 1:12:21.467
Rocket launcher.

1:12:22.734 --> 1:12:26.033
That's right. You never know
when you're gonna need one.

1:12:26.066 --> 1:12:27.867
Hey, he's got
a rocket launcher or something

1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.266
so he's gonna be shooting
at you guys, so watch
the out.

1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:33.800
Rock... Rocket launcher?

1:12:35.734 --> 1:12:38.800
Just don't hit
the frickin' house, please.

1:12:38.834 --> 1:12:39.900
Roger that.

1:12:39.934 --> 1:12:42.600
Dude, I just have a feeling
this is gonna go bad.

1:12:42.634 --> 1:12:44.367
If Neal shoots his window out,

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:45.800
I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:50.900
Okay, I'm in neutral.
I'm in neutral.

1:12:50.934 --> 1:12:53.300
I'm, I'm gonna be off the...
I'm gonna go hide.

1:13:00.467 --> 1:13:02.634
Don't try this at home.

1:13:02.667 --> 1:13:05.166
Okay, guys.
Fire away.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:08.634
Yeah, man.

1:13:13.300 --> 1:13:15.667
What the [bleep]?

1:13:15.700 --> 1:13:16.967
Where did it go?

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.233
Catch that line.

1:13:26.133 --> 1:13:29.200
Oh, yeah. Got it down.

1:13:29.233 --> 1:13:32.600
Get that bad boy.
Oh, hey, they got it. Sweet.

1:13:32.634 --> 1:13:34.400
- The rocket man.
- Whoo!

1:13:36.700 --> 1:13:37.934
Wow, they got it.

1:13:37.967 --> 1:13:41.033
That thing, hell, then it went
in front of crab lights, man,

1:13:41.066 --> 1:13:42.734
it barely got the bow.

1:13:42.767 --> 1:13:45.000
Yeah, that freaking worked.
That was amazing.

1:13:47.667 --> 1:13:49.500
I can see why the old man
loved that guy.

1:13:49.533 --> 1:13:50.800
He's so nuts.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.100
All right, we're all lined up.

1:13:53.133 --> 1:13:54.600
We're getting
in position here, so

1:13:54.634 --> 1:13:56.333
Johnny kind of figured out
the set and drift,

1:13:56.367 --> 1:13:58.600
so our pot should be
down here just,

1:13:58.634 --> 1:14:02.333
just a hair below
where their actual marks are
on the screen.

1:14:02.367 --> 1:14:04.700
So as long as we run this
at 50 degrees,

1:14:04.734 --> 1:14:06.634
we should be able
to zip right up

1:14:06.667 --> 1:14:09.667
a little bit south
of our marks
and scoop up the pots.

1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:11.233
This is gonna work,
I'm telling you.

1:14:14.266 --> 1:14:15.767
Hey,
I'm about 50 degrees.

1:14:17.433 --> 1:14:19.200
So I'm gonna hold this course

1:14:19.233 --> 1:14:21.533
until you tell me what to do.

1:14:21.567 --> 1:14:22.967
You're doing good right there.

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.867
I'm gonna
come a little closer to you.

1:14:24.900 --> 1:14:26.834
Yeah, okay, I'm coming over.

1:14:26.867 --> 1:14:28.400
I'll come over closer
to you, Casey.

1:14:30.133 --> 1:14:31.567
Oh,

1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:32.834
Hey, go starboard
a little bit.

1:14:32.867 --> 1:14:34.500
Let's give him
a little gap here, huh?

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.667
I came a little bit closer
to you already,

1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:39.934
so I'm gonna go to 50
right now and stay there.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:44.300
Important thing
Casey is you stay

1:14:44.333 --> 1:14:46.800
the away
from me, okay?

1:14:46.834 --> 1:14:48.667
Stay at least a
away from me,

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:49.967
and... and I'll do the same.

1:14:51.367 --> 1:14:52.867
Hey, you can actually
take it out of gear,

1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:54.400
so we get the same thing
a little.

1:14:54.433 --> 1:14:56.133
No, don't worry
about that.

1:14:56.166 --> 1:14:58.467
Worry about hitting me
and me not hitting you.

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.367
50 degrees still,
50 degrees.

1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:04.867
Yeah, don't worry
about the numbers, Johnny.

1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:07.166
I will drive next to you,
and I promise to God,
I won't hit you.

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:11.367
- I'm gonna hit the here.
- I'm okay.

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:12.834
I'm okay. We're all okay.

1:15:12.867 --> 1:15:14.433
My bow's
gonna hit you.

1:15:14.467 --> 1:15:17.300
My bow's going out of the way,
I'm gonna hit you.

1:15:17.333 --> 1:15:20.433
, I know
what's gonna happen
before it happens.

1:15:22.567 --> 1:15:23.767
Okay, I'm gonna start
backing up.

1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:25.834
Holy

1:15:29.133 --> 1:15:30.467
Move a little faster.

1:15:33.066 --> 1:15:34.100
There.

1:15:40.867 --> 1:15:42.467
He's trying to get more room
in between us

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:44.300
'cause he's not comfortable,
but he almost us.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.066
Tell him to watch that line.

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:54.033
I think we're pulling
way too hard on this, Josh.

1:15:54.066 --> 1:15:57.634
It's definitely
pulling that block back
pretty damn hard, man.

1:16:00.133 --> 1:16:01.834
It looks like
he's pulling real tight.

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:05.800
- Ahhh.
- Watch out.

1:16:05.834 --> 1:16:06.934
Oh!

1:16:08.100 --> 1:16:10.333
Did it just break off?

1:16:10.367 --> 1:16:11.400
Dude.

1:16:12.667 --> 1:16:13.967
Did it snap?

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.867
It snapped, dude.
It snapped on our end.

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:17.433
God.

1:16:17.467 --> 1:16:18.767
I hope
you got your end.

1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:26.700
This week on Salty Takes.

1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:30.300
It's okay, Shyanne.

1:16:30.333 --> 1:16:32.600
I was seasick
for the first two weeks.

1:16:38.066 --> 1:16:39.634
It tastes like chicken.

1:16:39.667 --> 1:16:42.000
Yeah, I threw up
a whole burrito, dude.

1:16:47.467 --> 1:16:48.900
She's an Anderson,

1:16:48.934 --> 1:16:50.734
and I think
she'll be just fine.

1:16:52.634 --> 1:16:53.667
Hopefully.

1:16:59.467 --> 1:17:01.000
Bering Sea, one,

1:17:01.033 --> 1:17:02.700
Shyanne, zero.

1:17:11.367 --> 1:17:13.200
I think we're pulling way
too hard on this, Josh.

1:17:13.233 --> 1:17:17.033
It's... it's definitely
pulling that block back
pretty damn hard, man.

1:17:17.066 --> 1:17:18.634
- Ahhh!
- Watch out.

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:23.000
Did it snap?

1:17:23.033 --> 1:17:24.900
It snapped, dude.
It snapped on our end.

1:17:24.934 --> 1:17:26.300
God.

1:17:26.333 --> 1:17:28.533
I hope
you got your end.

1:17:33.133 --> 1:17:34.900
Yeah, we still got it.
hang on.

1:17:34.934 --> 1:17:36.533
Oh!

1:17:36.567 --> 1:17:38.367
All right. I'll just
let the crew know,
they're gonna wind it in.

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:39.767
I'm gonna stop here, John.

1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:41.667
Okay, I'm gonna
peel out of your way.

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:42.767
Sorry about that.

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.300
Okay, that's quite good
right there.

1:17:47.333 --> 1:17:48.367
Stop it.

1:17:52.066 --> 1:17:54.133
I think we should keep going,
but it's up to you.

1:17:55.967 --> 1:17:57.634
You got another spare rocket
over there, Johnny?

1:17:59.066 --> 1:18:00.567
I don't know.
Do we?

1:18:01.867 --> 1:18:03.700
Come on. Fire.

1:18:03.734 --> 1:18:05.266
Fire. Yeah.

1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:07.467
Fire in the hole.

1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:08.700
Did you get it?

1:18:10.867 --> 1:18:12.433
They got it.

1:18:12.467 --> 1:18:15.233
Yeah, same place
as the last one.

1:18:16.734 --> 1:18:19.400
That's what I'll say.
God bless America right now.

1:18:19.433 --> 1:18:20.533
Catch it.

1:18:20.567 --> 1:18:22.000
You just never know
what John has.

1:18:22.033 --> 1:18:24.000
He might even have a tank
in the bottom of that boat.

1:18:25.634 --> 1:18:27.066
Okay, guys,
let's go ahead and deploy

1:18:27.100 --> 1:18:28.867
the grappling hook again.

1:18:28.900 --> 1:18:30.800
Clear that hook, we're gonna
set the hook back over.

1:18:30.834 --> 1:18:33.934
You need to get this haul
set up the second time.

1:18:33.967 --> 1:18:35.467
Roger.

1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:36.667
Don't let her go down.

1:18:38.967 --> 1:18:40.967
You just tell me what to do,
which direction to go,

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:42.600
and how fast to go, buddy.

1:18:42.634 --> 1:18:44.500
Round two.
Let's see what happens.

1:18:44.533 --> 1:18:45.834
See if we can get
those ten pots in.

1:18:47.567 --> 1:18:49.467
And we should be coming up
on the first one here,

1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:50.900
just keep an eye on the line.

1:18:50.934 --> 1:18:52.900
Hopefully, we'll see
a couple of tugs on this thing

1:18:52.934 --> 1:18:54.433
and get a little bite
on the hook.

1:18:54.467 --> 1:18:57.567
Yeah, one jerk on one end
waiting for a jerk
on the other end.

1:18:57.600 --> 1:18:59.266
He's a son of a

1:19:00.967 --> 1:19:02.600
Trying to hook
the wheel, boys.

1:19:02.634 --> 1:19:04.133
All right. Well, here we go.

1:19:05.967 --> 1:19:07.133
Looks like the line's tugging.

1:19:07.166 --> 1:19:08.900
Looks like we got one
right there.

1:19:08.934 --> 1:19:10.100
That might be our first pot.

1:19:11.367 --> 1:19:12.734
We got one.

1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:18.166
All right,
that's pot numero uno.

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:20.300
Pot number two
is coming up, man.

1:19:20.333 --> 1:19:21.467
This right here.

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:22.767
This should be
our pot number two

1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:24.266
we're coming
across the top over here.

1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:26.266
Yeah, these are
a 10th of a mile apart, right?

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:29.834
That line's popping pretty
hard though, huh, Neal?

1:19:29.867 --> 1:19:31.367
Yeah, it's tight.

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:35.033
Whoa!

1:19:35.066 --> 1:19:36.800
Coming up,
to pot number three.

1:19:36.834 --> 1:19:38.900
Dude, it's bouncing again.

1:19:38.934 --> 1:19:40.700
Something else
just hit the line.

1:19:41.834 --> 1:19:43.367
- It's working.
- Yes, it is.

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:47.834
You got it, man.

1:19:47.867 --> 1:19:49.634
All right, go ahead
and stop the boats.

1:19:49.667 --> 1:19:51.567
We'll, uh,
we'll bring these things in.

1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:53.266
Okay, buddy.

1:19:53.300 --> 1:19:54.834
Go ahead and cut them, Neal.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:01.734
We'll go ahead
and haul her back and,

1:20:01.767 --> 1:20:03.400
and see if we got
any on there.

1:20:06.300 --> 1:20:08.200
pop out back there.

1:20:08.233 --> 1:20:10.333
Our buoys pop out there.

1:20:10.367 --> 1:20:12.033
Pull them up.
Pull them up.

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:15.100
That's a pile of buoys.

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:19.266
Thank God, it worked.

1:20:20.700 --> 1:20:22.567
Pull those buoys up.

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:24.000
Get every buoy over the rail.

1:20:24.033 --> 1:20:26.767
Keep going.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:29.200
You, you got 'em off.
I see 'em there. Wow.

1:20:31.133 --> 1:20:34.600
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1:20:34.634 --> 1:20:36.400
Got all of them.

1:20:36.433 --> 1:20:37.734
Are we all aboard?

1:20:40.767 --> 1:20:42.166
Okay, now put it to block.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.433
I think it just saved
our... our big string here.

1:20:47.467 --> 1:20:50.533
If it comes up loaded,
well, we're in business.

1:20:50.567 --> 1:20:51.667
Yeah, okay. You got it.

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:52.967
I'm just gonna
get out of your way.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.900
All right,
here we go.
We're

1:20:55.934 --> 1:20:59.967
Yo! Pot's up. Survey says...

1:21:00.066 --> 1:21:02.867
Oh! There it is. There we go.

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:04.367
Whoo!

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:06.734
All right, boys,
look at that, huh?

1:21:06.767 --> 1:21:08.500
Hey, there we go.
There's a few.

1:21:08.533 --> 1:21:10.066
We got something going on.

1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:12.800
Wow, man. Looks good.

1:21:12.834 --> 1:21:14.533
Off to a good start here, Josh.

1:21:16.533 --> 1:21:17.867
Oh.

1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:19.834
It's just the cold out here.

1:21:19.867 --> 1:21:22.967
There's no one else to help
each other except us out here.

1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.533
There's a lot of great
industries in this country

1:21:25.567 --> 1:21:29.066
that are gone,
completely faded away,

1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:32.467
and I definitely am not gonna
let that happen here.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.200
You guys ready to go?
Toss them.

1:21:35.233 --> 1:21:36.634
Get some breath.

1:21:36.667 --> 1:21:38.033
We're gonna go crabbing.

1:21:38.066 --> 1:21:39.567
Whoo-hoo!

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:42.166
We're not gonna
peacefully stand by
and watch this happen.

1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:45.100
Jake.

1:21:45.133 --> 1:21:48.033
I'm gonna order up a bunch
of Dwyer blue and, uh,

1:21:48.066 --> 1:21:51.233
Dwyer tan so I can be ready
for the swap when it happens.

1:21:51.266 --> 1:21:54.834
Don't do it.
Don't order the paint yet.

1:21:54.867 --> 1:21:57.934
It's about
all the sacrifices
the men made before us,

1:21:57.967 --> 1:21:59.166
the lives given,

1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:01.533
I'm not letting that
be for nothing.

1:22:01.567 --> 1:22:03.166
People get
to see what it takes

1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:04.500
to come back from adversity.

1:22:04.533 --> 1:22:06.367
They're gonna see it.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:08.066
When it happens, you get up,

1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:09.800
you get back on that
freaking horse,

1:22:09.834 --> 1:22:12.433
even though I hate horses,
with a passion.

1:22:14.133 --> 1:22:16.500
The only way
we're gonna better
what we have...

1:22:18.533 --> 1:22:20.567
...is to go
where we've never been.

1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:22.400
We don't really know
what we were getting into

1:22:22.433 --> 1:22:23.500
when we get into this fishery,

1:22:23.533 --> 1:22:26.533
but desperate times call
for desperate measures.

1:22:26.567 --> 1:22:28.667
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- Oh, yeah.

1:22:29.834 --> 1:22:32.967
The Alaskan golden king crab.

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:34.767
We have a chance.

1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:36.834
Nothing's easy about this one.

1:22:36.867 --> 1:22:38.133
Ain't nothing easy about this.

1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:42.066
It's a whole new era.

1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:52.767
Cut the line. Cut the line.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.000
Ahhh!

1:22:54.033 --> 1:22:57.333
This season more than ever
is gonna be the test.

1:22:57.367 --> 1:22:58.934
Oh, no!

1:22:58.967 --> 1:23:00.634
Coming in hot.

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:04.233
Right now we're doing
everything by trial and fire.

1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:10.166
Oh, is it here?
Holy moly.

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:12.800
I would not do this
if I didn't have to.

1:23:12.834 --> 1:23:14.233
Whoa! Watch, watch out.

1:23:14.266 --> 1:23:16.900
It's scary because
you can't make a mistake.

1:23:16.934 --> 1:23:18.100
Ahhh!

1:23:18.133 --> 1:23:19.300
Oh,

1:23:19.333 --> 1:23:20.467
Get away.

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:22.333
Down. Down.

1:23:23.834 --> 1:23:25.367
Open your eyes, buddy.

1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:27.433
We might not all make it
through this.

1:23:29.033 --> 1:23:31.967
If we get through this,
we've built
something stronger.

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.133
Oh!

1:23:33.166 --> 1:23:34.266
Yeah!

1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:35.367
That's a big...

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:36.500
Oh, yeah.

1:23:37.667 --> 1:23:39.367
Something
that will last.
