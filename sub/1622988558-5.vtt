‐Man, I just wanted you

00:30.170 --> 00:32.041
to hear my new track
before you dipped, that's all.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.245
Oh, man, that shit was hard.
Honestly, I'm just waiting

00:34.278 --> 00:35.480
for the Gata/Lil Dicky collab.

00:35.515 --> 00:36.617
Hmm.

00:36.650 --> 00:38.253
Man...

00:38.286 --> 00:39.523
Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

00:39.556 --> 00:40.758
You're leaving right now?

00:40.792 --> 00:42.428
Yes. I left you a bunch of shit

00:42.461 --> 00:44.198
on your computer, bro‐‐
what do you need from me?

00:44.232 --> 00:45.635
I don't need anything.
It'd be nice to chill

00:45.668 --> 00:47.606
with my friend
every once in a while, but...

00:47.639 --> 00:49.810
I have no more chill. Also,
I'm working with Travis today,

00:49.843 --> 00:52.314
so when he moves,
I move, brother.

00:52.348 --> 00:54.318
‐Man. Okay, big dawg.
‐It be like that.

00:54.352 --> 00:56.624
‐Love.
‐MIKE: Okay,
I got all the details.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.159
No, no, that's...
Yeah, no, that's fine.

00:58.193 --> 00:59.262
We have the address.
It's all locked in.

00:59.295 --> 01:01.332
We will see you tonight.
Bye‐bye.

01:01.366 --> 01:03.336
Um, I'm about to send
all you guys the itinerary

01:03.370 --> 01:05.207
for the bar mitzvah tonight.
Gata, you don't need

01:05.240 --> 01:07.344
to be there.
Elz, you do need to be there.

01:07.378 --> 01:09.415
‐GATA: Whoo!
‐This guy's paying us
three times Dave's normal rate,

01:09.448 --> 01:11.520
so we just got to do
what he wants, you know?

01:11.553 --> 01:12.789
It's disgusting
what this schmuck is doing.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.626
When I was 13,
my dad put our dog down.

01:14.660 --> 01:15.795
‐DAVE: What?
‐Same day.

01:15.828 --> 01:17.264
‐Oh, man.
‐DAVE: That's so sad.

01:17.298 --> 01:18.534
I love bar mitzvahs.
I can't wait.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.237
I haven't been to one
in so long.

01:20.270 --> 01:21.540
Me and Elz have been
to tens of hundreds of them,

01:21.573 --> 01:23.343
and we used to, honestly,
get kicked out

01:23.376 --> 01:25.213
for various misbehaving, uh...

01:25.247 --> 01:28.286
We called in a bomb threat
one time. Post‐911.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.556
‐Okay.
‐How many do you think

01:29.589 --> 01:31.727
‐we've been kicked out of?
‐A lot.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.600
‐All right, hotshot, I get it.
‐Don't call in a bomb tonight,
all right?

01:34.633 --> 01:36.302
‐I won't.
‐Goodbye.

01:36.336 --> 01:38.273
‐Peace.
‐Man, that's the
hardest working man

01:38.306 --> 01:39.676
in showbiz right there.

01:39.710 --> 01:41.279
‐Him? Elz?
‐Yeah.

01:41.312 --> 01:43.350
Come on, don't fall
for that fuckin' shit.

01:43.383 --> 01:45.454
I work ten times harder
than him‐‐ he just met

01:45.487 --> 01:47.592
the right people at the...

01:49.496 --> 01:51.399
Wow.

01:51.432 --> 01:54.238
You know, I never just, like,
think to look up at the sky

01:54.271 --> 01:55.608
and, like, the mountains,
and, like, appreciate

01:55.642 --> 01:57.912
‐all of the...
‐Can I borrow some money?

01:57.946 --> 02:00.150
This bar mitzvah ain't
gonna get me by, dawg,

02:00.183 --> 02:02.154
and moms is struggling.

02:02.187 --> 02:04.125
I need a few dollars, bro,
like an advance or something.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.262
We ain't got no shows.
You on album mode.

02:06.296 --> 02:08.534
Like, I don't know
what to do, dawg.

02:09.536 --> 02:11.840
Yeah. Okay.

02:11.874 --> 02:14.145
How much money?

02:14.178 --> 02:15.615
A little'll go a long way,
to be honest.

02:15.648 --> 02:16.650
All right, yeah, no problem.

02:16.684 --> 02:18.320
I'm thinking...

02:18.353 --> 02:19.723
Actually, can we talk about this
when I'm not high?

02:19.756 --> 02:21.593
‐Yeah. Enjoy the weed, bro.
‐Cool.

02:22.595 --> 02:24.833
I am Queens Boulevard!

02:24.866 --> 02:26.202
(laughs)

02:26.235 --> 02:27.605
Do you get that?

02:27.639 --> 02:29.676
Nah. It sounds like
a corny Broadway, though.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.513
A corny Broadway?

02:31.547 --> 02:33.584
It's a... (stammers)
Do Black people watch Entourage?

02:33.617 --> 02:34.853

And that time in my life
was truly the best.

02:41.366 --> 02:43.637
I used to sit on the spigot‐‐
you know, like, outside

02:43.671 --> 02:45.708
where you
fill water balloons up?

02:45.742 --> 02:48.446
I'd sit on it and let the water
gush all the way up my body,

02:48.480 --> 02:50.417
while everyone else crowded
around to see if I got hard.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.388
‐Why?
‐Don't ask me.

02:52.421 --> 02:54.926
I was just a mindless extension
of my boner back then.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.297
We did the craziest shit.
There was one occasion

02:57.331 --> 03:00.203
where I actually licked
a hamster's pussy.

03:00.237 --> 03:02.542
‐What?!
‐Ew! What the fuck?

03:02.575 --> 03:04.546
I was dared.
I'm not gonna turn down a dare.

03:04.579 --> 03:05.915
You had to.
This is what you did.

03:05.948 --> 03:07.919
You had to do it.
Elz dared me.

03:07.952 --> 03:09.756
I think this is
a Jewish camp thing.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.394
No, I have plenty of kids in
my class who went to Jewish camp

03:12.428 --> 03:15.935
who managed to not lick
any part of a hamster, anywhere.

03:15.968 --> 03:17.739
‐Oh, please.
‐(farts)

03:17.772 --> 03:19.576
You think they're going up
to you and being like, "Oh,

03:19.609 --> 03:20.945
"Mrs. Wernick, you should know

03:20.978 --> 03:22.649
I just sniffed piss
out of a dirt pit"?

03:22.682 --> 03:24.418
‐ALLY: Ugh.
‐You guys
never experimented at all

03:24.452 --> 03:26.690
‐when you were kids?
‐I‐I had a problem with...

03:26.724 --> 03:28.928
thinking that, like, pretty
much all inanimate objects

03:28.961 --> 03:30.565
had feelings.

03:30.598 --> 03:32.936
So I was, like,
devastated when I threw away

03:32.969 --> 03:34.906
‐napkins and tissues and stuff.
‐DAVE: Very cute,

03:34.940 --> 03:36.777
but I'm really not interested
in the bush‐league stuff.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.281
I'm talking
about the real nitty‐gritty.

03:39.315 --> 03:41.920
‐I used to Rollerblade
caterpillars in half.
‐(phone chimes)

03:41.954 --> 03:43.491
‐All right.
‐Yeah.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.229
‐Kind of satanic.
‐(Ally giggles)

03:46.262 --> 03:47.297
A little bit.

03:47.331 --> 03:48.968
What's so funny, Hoot?

03:49.001 --> 03:50.972
Uh, don't call me Hoot, Dave.

03:51.005 --> 03:52.509
Boundaries.

03:52.542 --> 03:53.911
I'm not hitting on you,
hotshot, okay?

03:53.944 --> 03:55.782
You're an owl
at the end of the day,

03:55.815 --> 03:58.687
‐and you'll always be an owl.
‐I never crave Indian food,

03:58.721 --> 04:00.658
but when I do it, I love it.

04:00.691 --> 04:02.896
That's pretty much exactly
how I feel about reading.

04:04.031 --> 04:05.434
(laughs)

04:05.467 --> 04:07.906
Is this the goal?

04:10.277 --> 04:12.749
Write any good songs lately?

04:12.782 --> 04:14.351
I don't want to talk about it.

04:14.385 --> 04:15.855
Oh, before I forget,
Elz' manager reached out.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.492
Are you aware that
he wants credit on every song

04:17.525 --> 04:19.261
‐on the album he produces?
‐I wasn't even aware

04:19.295 --> 04:20.965
he had a manager, but,
you know, if he made the beat,

04:20.998 --> 04:22.569
give him credit‐‐
what do I care?

04:22.602 --> 04:23.904
No, but, like, as an artist.

04:23.938 --> 04:24.739
He wants it:
"Lil Dicky featuring Elz."

04:24.773 --> 04:26.008
What?

04:26.042 --> 04:28.446
Yeah, I thought
it was weird, too,

04:28.480 --> 04:30.618
‐but then I just assumed you
guys had already discussed it.
‐No, we have not.

04:30.651 --> 04:32.555
Every song featuring Elz?
I don't understand.

04:32.589 --> 04:34.659
He's not even an artist.
He makes beats.

04:34.693 --> 04:37.397
‐What about DJ Khaled or,
like, even Benny?
‐Yeah, but it's fuckin' Elz.

04:37.431 --> 04:38.399
He's gonna do it
manager‐to‐manager,

04:38.433 --> 04:39.435
like a fucking pussy?

04:39.468 --> 04:40.805
What is with him right now?

04:40.838 --> 04:42.942
I don't know
if it's a pussy move, Dave.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.345
‐Oh, my God...
‐People use managers...
‐MOSKOWITZ: There they are.

04:44.378 --> 04:46.082
Big men on campus
coming through!

04:46.115 --> 04:47.619
‐Hi.
‐Little Dicky.

04:47.652 --> 04:49.421
‐Yeah. Call me Dave.
‐You must be Mike?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.825
‐Of course, yeah.
Good to see you.
‐How was the drive?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.060
You find the place okay?

04:52.094 --> 04:54.633
‐We just... Google Maps.
‐I zoned out.

04:54.666 --> 04:55.535
‐Uh‐huh.
‐Fabulous home.

04:55.568 --> 04:56.770
Thank you.

04:56.804 --> 04:57.872
‐Thank you.
‐Where do we, uh...?

04:57.906 --> 04:59.308
‐Oh. Follow me.
‐Great.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.578
MOSKOWITZ:
Look who's here.

05:00.611 --> 05:01.780
‐Huh? Look who's here.
‐Hi.

05:01.814 --> 05:03.316
‐Oh.
‐Hey, man.

05:03.349 --> 05:05.086
‐You okay? Is he...?
‐He's very shy.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.990
‐Yeah.
‐He's got awful stage fright.

05:07.024 --> 05:08.994
‐Aw.
‐But honestly,

05:09.028 --> 05:10.898
knowing that LD
was gonna be here,

05:10.932 --> 05:12.936
that's helping him
get through this whole thing.

05:12.969 --> 05:16.375
So I‐I... I don't know how
I can thank you enough

05:16.409 --> 05:17.946
for being here, guys.

05:17.979 --> 05:19.783
‐Yeah. Yeah.
‐Uh, everything working right?

05:19.816 --> 05:21.787
No, man. This, like,
eighth inch is too short,

05:21.820 --> 05:23.791
and the speakers
are way in my fuckin' ear,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.795
and it's like, dude, how am I
supposed to listen to anything

05:25.828 --> 05:28.366
if it's just yelling at me
the whole time, you know?

05:28.399 --> 05:29.970
I am so sorry. Shoot.

05:30.003 --> 05:33.376
Um, look, uh, I can get
a longer one here by tomorrow.

05:33.409 --> 05:35.548
Just let me know
what type of cord you need.

05:35.581 --> 05:38.521
It's really not worth it.
Honestly, like, fuck it.

05:38.554 --> 05:40.858
Uh, is there a way that I
can move this keyboard, though?

05:40.892 --> 05:42.896
'Cause it's all in my way,
and I just need to...

05:42.929 --> 05:46.803
‐I need some space to...
‐Hmm. Uh,
let me think about that.

05:46.837 --> 05:48.507
You know, that‐that's gonna be
a little harder.

05:48.541 --> 05:50.076
Honestly,
please don't trouble yourself.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.813
‐We can be very flexible.
‐It's so light, I can move it

05:51.847 --> 05:53.383
if your arms don't work
or something.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.120
MOSKOWITZ:
No, it's not about the weight.

05:55.153 --> 05:58.727
Uh, our keyboardist
is actually blind.

05:58.761 --> 06:01.500
He's an old friend
of the family, and...

06:01.533 --> 06:03.469
he's already memorized
the space.

06:03.504 --> 06:05.875
‐I could give him a ring.
I'll give him a ring.
‐No. No. No.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.579
He's got the lay of the land.

06:07.612 --> 06:09.516
‐We had a blind dog
when I was a kid.
‐Yeah.

06:09.549 --> 06:11.520
My dad, piece of shit, he used
to rearrange the furniture

06:11.553 --> 06:13.724
‐so he'd bump into it
to fuck with it.
‐So the... Yeah.

06:13.757 --> 06:15.160
Yeah. So I know
what you're going through.

06:15.193 --> 06:17.899
I got it. Hey,
you want to not be an asshole

06:17.932 --> 06:20.638
to the guy who's paying us
for the event? That'd be great.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.107
Hey, you want to be
not an asshole

06:22.140 --> 06:24.044
and leave me the fuck alone?

06:24.078 --> 06:25.781
Mm. How about we just
sound‐check, how about that?

06:25.815 --> 06:27.952
How about I walk away
and you do this by yourself,

06:27.986 --> 06:30.691
‐since you're so independent?
‐I don't know how to work
the equipment...

06:30.725 --> 06:32.762
Well, figure it out.

06:32.795 --> 06:35.868
‐Cool.
‐You're so smart, right?

06:35.902 --> 06:37.805
Yeah, I'll figure it out,
no problem.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.843
It's an easy job, right?
It's not that hard to deejay.

06:39.876 --> 06:42.949
(amplified):
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah!
Check, check.

06:42.982 --> 06:45.655
My deejay sucks.

06:45.688 --> 06:47.525
Uh, deep‐seated insecurity.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.663
Masked as overconfidence.

06:49.696 --> 06:53.537
(loudly):
I'm saying that sometimes I get
this white foam around my mouth.

06:53.570 --> 06:55.841
‐Let me know if you see that.
‐Oh, I will.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.146
‐I don't have it now, do I?
‐DAVE: ...battling insecurity...

18:46.863 --> 18:49.568
It's so much more fun to be a
kid than any other time in life.

18:49.602 --> 18:51.438
Have you met Lil Nas X?

18:51.471 --> 18:52.641
No.

18:52.675 --> 18:54.512
Uh, you ever
pass each other out?

18:54.545 --> 18:56.315
What's that?

18:56.348 --> 18:57.885
That's where you put your hands
on the one person's neck

18:57.918 --> 19:00.356
until you lose oxygen,
you black out and faint.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.195
No? I used to do it
with my deejay all the time.

19:03.228 --> 19:04.331
It was amazing.

19:04.364 --> 19:05.767
‐Elz, right?
‐Yeah.

19:05.801 --> 19:08.372
I know your whole crew.
You guys are savages.

19:08.405 --> 19:10.644
Thank you. Yeah,
we, uh, we grew up together.

19:10.677 --> 19:12.480
We would always,
honestly, compete

19:12.514 --> 19:14.351
over who could do
the craziest shit.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.823
Speaking of shit, have you
ever shit on each other's shit?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.862
Laxatives.
Eat the laxatives. Come in.

19:19.895 --> 19:21.933
Gut full of laxatives. Shit.

19:21.966 --> 19:24.772
Next guy comes in ready to pop.
Polaroid camera. Picture.

19:24.805 --> 19:26.909
Post it all over the lockers
at school.

19:26.943 --> 19:28.947
We'd get canceled
if we did that.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.884
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

19:30.917 --> 19:33.623
‐You guys worry
about cancel culture?
‐You have to.

19:33.656 --> 19:35.226
You have the perfect alibi.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.562
You're young.
You don't know any better.

19:36.596 --> 19:38.500
Your brains
aren't even fully formed.

19:38.533 --> 19:41.438
Like, the grooves in your skull
aren't even, like, creased.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.941
‐Huh.
‐MOSKOWITZ: Tell me,

19:42.975 --> 19:44.779
‐what's your, uh, wife do?
‐Mm.

19:44.812 --> 19:46.516
Other than break my wallet?

19:46.549 --> 19:48.686
‐(laughs)
‐I know that feeling.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.526
‐I know you do. I saw.
This is unbelievable.
‐(laughing)

19:51.559 --> 19:53.362
‐This is remarkable, this home.
‐Yeah.

19:53.395 --> 19:55.701
Uh, she's a bleeding‐heart
liberal, to the max.

19:55.734 --> 19:57.437
We are.
I'm as far left as it goes.

19:57.470 --> 19:59.441
I'm so far left
I might come back around.

19:59.474 --> 20:00.777
‐Uh‐huh.
‐Uh, she, uh,

20:00.811 --> 20:02.246
the company is called Climace.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.415
‐Climace.
‐Have you never heard of it?

20:03.449 --> 20:04.785
‐No.
‐They...

20:04.819 --> 20:06.789
What they do is,
they combat climate change

20:06.823 --> 20:09.461
and racism at the same time,
simultaneously.

20:09.495 --> 20:10.664
‐Really?
‐It's such a great organization,

20:10.697 --> 20:12.400
but the name is bad, you know.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.803
We're big BLM'ers.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.540
Are you into... are you BLM?

20:15.574 --> 20:17.410
‐Well, of course. Yeah.
‐Of cour... Yes.

20:17.443 --> 20:19.013
The whole time,
I thought there would only be

20:19.047 --> 20:20.483
the small, faint amount,
and then you're done.

20:20.517 --> 20:22.353
'Cause there's
nothing else there.

20:22.386 --> 20:23.857
I couldn't imagine that you'd do
another one, and there'd be...

20:23.890 --> 20:25.694
I‐I was mind‐blown.
I thought, I didn't realize

20:25.727 --> 20:27.798
you're supposed to wipe until
there's literally nothing there.

20:27.831 --> 20:29.401
'Cause I thought,
if it's that faint,

20:29.434 --> 20:31.304
there can't possibly be more.

20:31.338 --> 20:33.008
I mean, back when I was
your age, the first time

20:33.041 --> 20:35.413
I ever jerked off,
I used my own thoughts.

20:35.446 --> 20:37.483
I mean,
if I tried to do that now,

20:37.518 --> 20:40.557
the women would turn to sand
and blow away in the wind.

20:40.590 --> 20:43.295
‐Why?
‐'Cause we're
overly stimulated now.

20:43.328 --> 20:45.967
Isn't it crazy that "boner" is
the best option we have

20:46.001 --> 20:48.305
to, like, refer to a hard penis?

20:48.338 --> 20:50.443
"Hard‐on"? Like, anyone is...
you're white trash

20:50.476 --> 20:51.846
if you say "hard‐on."

20:51.879 --> 20:53.750
You know?
And I mean no disrespect

20:53.783 --> 20:55.987
to any of you guys
who might be white trash.

20:59.728 --> 21:02.467
No, he told me on his own.

21:02.501 --> 21:03.670
Mm.

21:07.009 --> 21:09.748
No, it was really just a test
to see how he'd react.

21:09.782 --> 21:12.453
I don't even need the credit.

21:12.487 --> 21:14.023
I don't know
if it's worth it anymore.

21:14.057 --> 21:16.027
DAVE:
If it makes you feel any better,

21:16.061 --> 21:19.000
I feel the exact same way now
as I did when I was your age.

21:19.033 --> 21:20.469
Like, mentally,
in terms of, like,

21:20.504 --> 21:22.473
the voices narrating
my thoughts‐‐

21:22.508 --> 21:24.645
it's a 13‐year‐old boy's voice,
still.

21:24.678 --> 21:26.649
My Torah passage makes it
such a big deal,

21:26.682 --> 21:28.352
you know, becoming a man.

21:28.385 --> 21:29.822
Ugh. Come on, Torah‐schmorah.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.492
You really believe
that horseshit?

21:31.526 --> 21:33.797
God made a man
out of a woman's rib?

21:33.830 --> 21:35.667
What is it, a five‐inch man?

21:35.700 --> 21:37.336
You know, all that
you really need to realize,

21:37.370 --> 21:39.407
Jakey, is you're getting older,

21:39.440 --> 21:42.346
and so perhaps start thinking
about being more mature

21:42.380 --> 21:44.017
here and there
and more responsible.

21:44.050 --> 21:46.021
‐That's all it is.
‐But you just said

21:46.054 --> 21:48.660
you're the same way
you've always been.

21:48.693 --> 21:51.398
Yeah, but...

21:52.801 --> 21:55.674
...you don't want to be
like me, okay?

21:55.707 --> 21:57.911
‐Yeah, we do.
‐OTHERS: Yeah.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.548
No, you don't.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.328
♪ ♪

22:12.941 --> 22:15.012
(muttering)

22:16.983 --> 22:18.887
Yo.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.924
‐Mm‐mm.
‐Seriously...
can we go talk for a second?

22:20.957 --> 22:22.393
For what?

22:22.426 --> 22:24.430
‐I'm being serious.
‐About what?

22:24.464 --> 22:25.834
‐Just come on. I'm just...
‐You're being
so dramatic, though.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.671
Just come on.
It's not that big of a deal.

22:27.704 --> 22:28.940
The longer
we let this bubble up,

22:28.973 --> 22:30.710
the more it's gonna suck,
so let's just...

22:30.744 --> 22:31.979
"Bubble up"? Why you acting
like such a bitch, bro?

22:32.013 --> 22:33.783
Why is it such
a dick‐swinging contest?

22:33.816 --> 22:35.921
A dick‐swinging contest?
Dude, nothing is dick‐swinging.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.724
‐Just grow the fuck up
and stop acting like a bitch.
‐Me grow up?

22:37.758 --> 22:38.826
‐You... How...?
‐You grow up.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.497
I've never even...

22:50.850 --> 22:53.455
Bro.

22:53.488 --> 22:55.025
(sighs)
I don't know.

22:55.994 --> 22:58.533
‐Dude.
‐I don't... I'm trying to...

22:58.566 --> 23:00.570
I'm trying to find the words,
too, but...

23:00.604 --> 23:02.574
I'm trying to think about
what it was that they were...

23:02.608 --> 23:03.977
I can't even...

23:04.010 --> 23:05.981
I mean, should we say anything
to these people,

23:06.014 --> 23:08.151
or is this, like, textbook
boyhood experimentation, right?

23:08.185 --> 23:09.755
‐Like...
‐Not my job, bro.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.626
I just think about the stuff
we used to do,

23:11.659 --> 23:13.563
‐like, with the marker
and, like, the...
‐Okay, enough.

23:13.596 --> 23:15.834
‐But that doesn't matter
to me, because...
‐MOSKOWITZ: Hey! Hey!

23:15.867 --> 23:18.005
‐JAKEY: Dad!
‐Can I have a word
with you guys?

23:18.038 --> 23:19.842
Yeah. Sure.

23:19.875 --> 23:22.446
Any idea what this is?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.816
‐Hmm?
‐Oh.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.987
Why would you post that
on TikTok?

23:26.021 --> 23:27.490
Are you out of your mind, Jakey?

23:27.524 --> 23:28.893
‐I'm so... I mean...
‐So you do know.

23:28.927 --> 23:30.597
‐JAKEY: Dad!
‐I had to get this sent to me

23:30.630 --> 23:32.601
‐by another parent.
‐Dad!
‐I'm sorry.

23:32.634 --> 23:33.870
‐That's got nothing
to do with us.
‐Whoa, whoa.

23:33.903 --> 23:35.439
We didn't do anything
about that.

23:35.472 --> 23:36.742
‐We just happened to walk...
‐We walked in...

23:36.776 --> 23:39.480
No, no.
Jakey told me that you said

23:39.515 --> 23:41.184
that because his brain
isn't fully formed,

23:41.217 --> 23:43.589
that he can do
whatever he wants?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.894
So out of context. Like, there
was a whole circle of trust

23:45.927 --> 23:47.598
‐that was...
‐Oh, a‐and what's this

23:47.631 --> 23:50.971
I hear about cunnilingus
on a marsupial?

23:51.004 --> 23:53.710
Hamster's a rodent, and it's...
it's a cautionary tale

23:53.743 --> 23:55.479
‐and it's got nothing to do
with what...
‐I don't give...

23:55.513 --> 23:56.749
‐We had nothing to do with that.
‐I don't... I do not care!

23:56.782 --> 23:58.018
‐Okay.
‐All right?

23:58.051 --> 23:59.888
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

23:59.922 --> 24:01.759
‐Both of you.
Get out of my house.
‐I mean, what‐‐

24:01.792 --> 24:04.130
how do you think he talks? What
do you think happens when he...?

24:04.163 --> 24:05.900
‐What does it matter?
We get paid on the back end.
‐He listens to Lil Dicky...

24:05.934 --> 24:08.138
I'm not paying you any more
money, not another dollar!

24:08.171 --> 24:10.142
‐Bro.
‐No. You just lea...

24:10.175 --> 24:11.946
‐What do you mean?
‐But you need to leave
right now.

24:11.979 --> 24:13.683
When you have a contract
with somebody,

24:13.716 --> 24:15.620
you just have to pay them
the money that they're owed.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.056
Hey, you want to control
your posse? Huh?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.760
‐Oh, my God.
‐Posse? Get a grip.

24:18.793 --> 24:20.162
It's a very racially charged
word, "posse," okay?

24:20.195 --> 24:21.866
Why don't you think
about the things you say?

24:21.899 --> 24:23.168
‐Racially charged?
‐He's my fucking friend, okay?

24:23.201 --> 24:24.772
‐Hey, hey, hey.
‐You booked Lil Dicky.

24:24.805 --> 24:26.542
‐I don't know what you expect.
‐I can't believe

24:26.575 --> 24:28.045
that you let Darren hang around
with these perverts!

24:28.078 --> 24:30.817
‐Who the fuck is Darren?
‐No, get the hell out right now!

24:30.850 --> 24:32.788
‐This is a chain reaction
that you started.
‐Leave right now!

24:32.821 --> 24:34.958
‐I didn't start anything!
You guys started it!
‐Fine, all right.

24:34.992 --> 24:36.896
‐I'm sorry, Jakey.
‐Get out of my house now!
‐JAKEY: Now they're leaving!

24:36.929 --> 24:39.635
Your fault!
You're the worst dad ever!

24:39.668 --> 24:40.804
You just suck it up, okay?

24:40.837 --> 24:42.073
‐MIKE: Hey.
‐Don't have a fit!

24:42.106 --> 24:43.876
It's his bar mitzvah.

24:48.285 --> 24:50.222
(Elz chuckles)

24:50.255 --> 24:52.561
(both laugh)

24:52.594 --> 24:54.531
I can't believe that kid
posted that on TikTok.

24:54.565 --> 24:56.101
ELZ:
I was thinking the same thing.
I can't believe

24:56.134 --> 24:58.539
that we got kicked out
of another fucking bar mitzvah
bro.

24:58.573 --> 25:00.577
‐What the fuck is going on?
‐We should've just called in
a bomb threat.

25:00.610 --> 25:03.248
‐We were such assholes
back then.
‐You were the bigger asshole

25:03.281 --> 25:06.822
‐when we were kids,
for the record.
‐I was the bigger asshole?

25:08.125 --> 25:10.563
We were both pretty bad.

25:10.597 --> 25:12.667
Yeah.

25:12.701 --> 25:14.605
What are you doing?

25:14.638 --> 25:17.243
Being a bigger asshole.

25:17.276 --> 25:19.615
‐DAVE: Oh... my God.
‐Go!

25:19.648 --> 25:21.852
‐Go, fucking go!
‐Get out! Get out! Go!
Come on, it's time!

25:21.886 --> 25:23.856
‐Come on, piggy boy!
‐Come on, it's time! It's time!

25:23.890 --> 25:25.560
‐We're free! We're free!
‐Come on! Come on!

25:25.593 --> 25:28.231
Save your soul.
Save your soul, llama.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.235
Come on, Pig Newton.
It's time to go, Pig Newton.

25:30.269 --> 25:32.574
Aah! Aah!
(mock sobbing)

25:32.607 --> 25:34.678
Go! Go! Yes, yes, yes!

25:34.712 --> 25:36.114
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.
Where'd you park?

25:36.147 --> 25:37.283
Uh, this way.

25:37.316 --> 25:39.555
(both laughing)

25:41.291 --> 25:43.563
(lowing)

25:47.771 --> 25:50.008
(bleating)

25:52.213 --> 25:54.618
(quietly):
What the fuck?

25:55.620 --> 25:57.724
That's crazy.

25:57.758 --> 26:00.797
(lowing, bleating)

26:09.147 --> 26:11.117
JAKEY:
No, d‐don't leave.

26:11.151 --> 26:12.119
(horse neighs)

26:12.153 --> 26:14.290
Gata! Gata! Gata!

26:14.323 --> 26:16.796
I‐It's my bar mitzvah,

26:16.829 --> 26:19.902
and my dad just kicked out LD,
a‐and now everyone's leaving.

26:19.935 --> 26:21.772
What you mean LD got kicked out?

26:21.806 --> 26:24.778
I‐I know all your songs.
You guys are my favorites.

26:24.812 --> 26:26.080
Just please help.

26:26.114 --> 26:27.951
(panting):
Please.

26:27.984 --> 26:30.322
‐I got you, bro.
I'm gonna hook you up, man.
‐Okay.

26:30.355 --> 26:31.759

‐Okay.

‐You say it's your bar mitzvah?
‐Yes. Yes.
