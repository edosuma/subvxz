WEBVTT

00:18.897 --> 00:20.799
Dennis, what are you doing here?

00:20.899 --> 00:23.803
I work here, remember?

00:23.903 --> 00:26.726
No, I know. I mean,
what are you doing here so early?

00:26.826 --> 00:29.709
Piper called.
Wanted me to set up for the band.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.252
Piper called?
From where, the doctor's?

00:32.351 --> 00:34.354
I don't know. Maybe.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.060
Is something wrong? Is she okay?

00:40.160 --> 00:43.645
Yeah, it's just a regular check-up
for the baby. I'm sure everything's fine.

00:46.928 --> 00:48.750
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Sure.

00:48.850 --> 00:51.893
You know Piper pretty well, don't you?
I mean, you guys seem close.

00:52.213 --> 00:53.515
Yeah, real close.

00:53.615 --> 00:55.838
What's the deal
with the ex of hers, Leo?

00:55.938 --> 00:58.521
You know, I mean,
dude gets her pregnant, right?

00:58.621 --> 01:02.545
Then, what, just skips town on her?
I mean, what's up with that?

01:02.865 --> 01:04.867
It's a long story.

01:05.829 --> 01:07.651
As far as I'm concerned,

01:07.751 --> 01:09.753
she deserves a hell of a lot better.

01:10.554 --> 01:12.556
Couldn't agree with you more.

01:20.285 --> 01:22.587
Are you hormonal
or just plain crazy?

01:22.687 --> 01:25.650
One woman can only take so much.

01:25.970 --> 01:29.735
If these people walk out of their offices,
what do you think they're gonna see?

01:30.095 --> 01:33.499
Well, I think they won't be touching my
stomach anymore, that's want I think.

01:33.859 --> 01:36.662
Piper, that is not a good enough
reason to freeze people.

01:36.983 --> 01:38.985
I think it is.

01:40.507 --> 01:43.950
It's okay, it's okay. We all just get
a little vertigo sometimes.

01:46.593 --> 01:50.318
No wonder Chris grows up
to be such a neurotic little freak.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.542
- So you excited?
- About what?

01:54.642 --> 01:57.305
About what the doctor said.
That it's gonna be a healthy baby.

01:57.405 --> 02:01.930
Well, I know he's healthy.
I've seen him 22 and walking around.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.073
You never know.
Something could happen.

02:04.173 --> 02:06.735
Don't be such a worrywart.
Now you're starting to sound like...

02:08.336 --> 02:10.160
- Hey.
...Chris.

02:10.259 --> 02:13.363
If this is about demons, I don't wanna
hear, because I'm on my lunch break.

02:13.463 --> 02:16.186
No, no, no. I was just wondering
how it went with the doctor.

02:16.786 --> 02:19.349
Well, you'll be happy to know
that you're a boy.

02:20.831 --> 02:23.294
- That's not what I meant.
- I don't see it.

02:23.394 --> 02:26.878
- Oh, see. It's this little thing right here.
- Excuse me.

02:27.278 --> 02:29.280
Do you mind?

02:36.208 --> 02:38.550
Why are you so edgy anyway?
Relax.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.895
Well, it's not me in there
I was thinking about, it's you.

02:42.215 --> 02:43.676
I'm just making sure you're okay.

02:43.777 --> 02:45.959
This is where he asks for money
to go to the movies.

02:46.059 --> 02:49.242
Very funny. Actually, in the future
you're the one I go to for money.

02:49.342 --> 02:52.005
- Oh, why? Am I rich?
- I can't tell you that.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.129
What about me? I'm your mother.
Why don't you come to me for money?

02:55.229 --> 02:57.732
I don't want to bother you.
You have too much to deal with.

02:57.832 --> 02:59.834
What about your dad?

03:00.234 --> 03:01.856
Leo's not much of a factor.

03:01.956 --> 03:04.039
- What does that mean?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

03:04.519 --> 03:07.643
- Future consequences?
- More like future issues.

03:08.483 --> 03:09.785
Father-son problems.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.887
I have an idea.
Let's change the subject.

03:12.528 --> 03:14.390
To what?

03:14.491 --> 03:16.493
Demons.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.335
Extinguisher.

03:36.034 --> 03:37.656
You guys okay?

03:37.756 --> 03:39.758
I don't know, am I?

03:42.881 --> 03:44.883
Am I?

03:45.564 --> 03:47.567
I don't know.

05:28.838 --> 05:33.844
So I'm okay, right?
I mean, mini-me in there?

05:34.244 --> 05:39.009
Well, if he wasn't, I think you'd be
the first to know. Now, sit still.

05:39.409 --> 05:41.151
Then why were you
so worried back there?

05:41.251 --> 05:43.253
I wasn't worried.

05:43.614 --> 05:47.098
All right, I was a little worried
about the force field.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.801
- What force field?
- The one she had

05:49.901 --> 05:52.083
when she was pregnant with Wyatt.

05:52.183 --> 05:54.986
Wait. You had a force field with Wyatt
but not with me?

05:55.468 --> 05:58.751
Well, I didn't have one, he had one.
It was all his doing.

05:59.632 --> 06:02.014
From the womb?
He had powers from the womb?

06:02.114 --> 06:05.438
Unbelievable. It's not like I don't have
an inferiority complex with him already.

06:05.758 --> 06:08.522
- Thank you.
- Did you find that demon yet?

06:08.842 --> 06:11.024
Yes, actually I did.

06:11.124 --> 06:12.506
It's the Spider Demon.

06:12.606 --> 06:17.492
"An evil creature that emerges from
its hidden lair every hundred years

06:17.852 --> 06:20.895
to capture and feed off the most
powerful magical being it can detect."

06:21.216 --> 06:23.218
- In this case, that would be you.
- And me.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.543
- Sort of.
- You must be so proud.

06:27.863 --> 06:30.125
It's kind of creepy how she knew
to lay a trap for you.

06:30.226 --> 06:32.328
Obviously, she didn't
count on us being there.

06:32.428 --> 06:34.630
Well, at least there's
a vanquishing potion here.

06:34.950 --> 06:37.733
Let's make this eight-legged freak
wish she'd never been hatched.

06:37.833 --> 06:40.957
Whoa, hold it. You are not going
anywhere, Mom. This is way too risky.

06:41.278 --> 06:43.920
He's actually right.
Without the Wyatt force-field thing...

06:44.481 --> 06:46.483
Okay, do you have to keep
rubbing that in?

06:47.244 --> 06:49.247
Aren't there any therapists
in the future?

06:49.727 --> 06:50.868
We need Phoebe.

06:50.968 --> 06:53.211
No, I don't want to interrupt
her date with Mark.

06:53.771 --> 06:55.153
Actually, it's Mike this week.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.635
No, it's Mitch. But who cares?
We need her.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.739
Ever since she had that vision thing
in Magic School, you know,

07:01.060 --> 07:04.944
the one about a demon-free life
and her being with child,

07:05.584 --> 07:07.206
she's been on
that whole future thing.

07:07.306 --> 07:09.949
And she wishes to accomplish that
by speed dating?

07:10.269 --> 07:12.252
I don't know.

07:12.352 --> 07:15.315
<i>So does the Book say anything</i>
<i>about that spider being poisonous?</i>

07:36.658 --> 07:38.721
Miss me?

07:38.821 --> 07:42.344
I was hoping that you would
let me die in peace.

07:42.705 --> 07:46.950
I'm sorry. I was raised to never
leave any food on my plate.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.332
Please. Have mercy.

07:49.432 --> 07:51.094
Oh, don't worry.

07:51.194 --> 07:54.018
There's not much of you
left to dine on anyway.

07:54.118 --> 07:59.964
My misery will soon be over,
but I suspect yours is just beginning.

08:01.245 --> 08:04.610
- How so?
- You've come back empty-handed.

08:04.930 --> 08:07.432
- You will starve.
- Hardly.

08:07.533 --> 08:12.137
I've already found my next meal.
A powerful witch. A Charmed One.

08:12.578 --> 08:15.902
A Charmed One?
I have heard of their coming.

08:16.302 --> 08:19.626
Really? Must be more powerful
than I thought.

08:19.946 --> 08:22.028
Hope my eyes aren't too big
for my stomach.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.250
You will never trap one.

08:24.350 --> 08:25.772
But I already have.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.975
I have infected her whitelighter.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.257
Soon he'll be my ally.

08:30.358 --> 08:35.001
As for you, my little wizard,
it's been a pleasure.

08:59.350 --> 09:00.531
Gentle, please.

09:00.631 --> 09:03.694
Oh, quit your complaining.
I'm almost done.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.777
Paige, could you call the club
and tell them I'm gonna be a little late?

09:06.877 --> 09:09.841
I thought we already discussed this.
You're not going without a force field.

09:10.162 --> 09:12.944
Why, because it's so much
safer here? I have to go to work.

09:13.044 --> 09:15.507
- I booked a band tonight.
- Let Paige cover for you.

09:15.607 --> 09:18.450
No, I can't. I have to get back
to my temp job. I'm already late.

09:18.810 --> 09:20.513
Blow it off. This is more important.

09:20.613 --> 09:24.177
My temp jobs are important. That's how
people who need help find me.

09:24.537 --> 09:28.061
Okay, I get that, I do. But right now
your sister needs your help, okay?

09:28.421 --> 09:30.283
- Why don't we just call Leo?
- No. No.

09:30.383 --> 09:33.147
Why not? He can help us.
Besides, Piper's in danger,

09:33.467 --> 09:36.630
which means the baby's in danger,
which means you are in danger.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.213
- Because we don't need him.
- Yeah, he's right.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.055
I don't wanna open up
that can of worms.

09:41.155 --> 09:43.138
He doesn't even know
you're pregnant.

09:43.238 --> 09:45.220
This is my point exactly.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.342
Look, I'm not suggesting
some sort of reunion...

09:47.442 --> 09:49.504
He has been gone for six months.

09:49.604 --> 09:53.049
If he's not there for us in the future,
why is he there for us now?

09:56.252 --> 09:57.914
Hey, you okay?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.216
Yeah, I just need
to sit down for a minute.

10:00.937 --> 10:03.480
Okay, well, I'll go deal with the club.

10:03.580 --> 10:07.664
You work on the vanquishing potion
and call Phoebe and I when it's done.

10:09.987 --> 10:11.989
I'll clean up.

10:36.657 --> 10:38.398
Hi, I'm supposed
to be meeting someone.

10:38.499 --> 10:40.240
- Right over there.
- Thanks.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.063
So sorry. Sorry.

10:43.383 --> 10:45.426
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

10:46.988 --> 10:50.512
Thanks. Last time I ride BART
for a while.

10:50.872 --> 10:52.774
The train, not the guy.

10:52.874 --> 10:55.236
Right. Right.

10:55.877 --> 10:58.461
Well, you look...
You look amazing, Phoebe.

10:58.561 --> 11:00.603
Oh, that's really sweet,
Mike, thanks.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.106
- Mitch.
- Mitch.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.349
Mitch, right. Of course.

11:06.449 --> 11:10.494
I'm sorry. I knew that, you know,
it's just I think I'm a little nervous.

11:11.335 --> 11:13.877
You nervous? That's hard to believe.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.540
Yeah, well, we both have a lot
at stake here, don't you think?

11:17.781 --> 11:19.324
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we do.

11:19.424 --> 11:21.045
We don't wanna waste any time.

11:21.145 --> 11:24.669
I think we're both over the serial-dating
thing, the loveless-sex thing.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.792
- We are?
- Don't you just want a family?

11:29.235 --> 11:31.237
Kids?

11:31.677 --> 11:33.859
l... I don't know.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.961
I hadn't really thought about it,
to be honest.

11:44.731 --> 11:47.794
Yeah, nothing. All right, so it was
great seeing you. You take care.

11:47.894 --> 11:49.396
But, Phoebe, l...

11:49.496 --> 11:51.039
Chris, hey.

11:51.139 --> 11:53.181
Oh, my God, you're sweating.
What happened to your neck?

11:53.901 --> 11:55.443
Piper was attacked by a demon.

11:55.543 --> 11:58.266
We need you back at the house
to help with the vanquishing potion.

11:58.586 --> 12:00.168
Okay.

12:00.268 --> 12:02.271
Take care, Mark.

12:03.032 --> 12:05.034
Mitch.

12:12.963 --> 12:15.025
Chris, you coming or what?

12:15.125 --> 12:17.127
Yeah.

12:23.174 --> 12:25.516
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- You didn't show up today.</i>

12:25.616 --> 12:28.579
Hi, yeah. I meant to call,
I really did.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.923
I just got a little hung up at...
At work.

12:32.023 --> 12:34.326
<i>What do you mean? Don't you care</i>
<i>about these temp jobs?</i>

12:34.426 --> 12:35.848
No... Yes, of course.

12:35.948 --> 12:39.031
- The temp jobs are important to me.
- Excuse me, Miss Matthews?

12:39.391 --> 12:41.213
Hate to bother you, love, but...

12:41.313 --> 12:43.135
Now is not a good time, okay?

12:43.235 --> 12:45.298
You're telling me.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.400
I'm supposed to be a leprechaun.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.064
The bar's not open yet.
Why don't you try down the street.

12:51.164 --> 12:52.746
You don't understand.

12:52.846 --> 12:56.130
The Wicked Witch of the Enchanted
Forest put a dastardly curse on me.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.816
I know you helped Shamus.

13:03.938 --> 13:07.703
Let me call you back.
You knew Shamus?

13:08.063 --> 13:09.324
He was me brother.

13:09.424 --> 13:13.829
Course, all leprechauns are,
but the point is we were close.

13:15.150 --> 13:16.452
Give me a second.

13:16.552 --> 13:19.716
Jeremy, could you
check on the beer in the back?

13:20.036 --> 13:22.038
No worries. Okay.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.882
Okay. How did you find me?

13:26.483 --> 13:31.088
I didn't, for sure. I was told
to find you at your temp jobs,

13:31.449 --> 13:33.451
but you don't seem
to be there anymore.

13:33.851 --> 13:34.992
Tell me about it.

13:35.092 --> 13:37.655
And I didn't want
to bother you at home.

13:37.975 --> 13:40.619
Thank you, I appreciate that. Okay.

13:40.939 --> 13:43.302
What did this wicked witch
do to you?

13:45.384 --> 13:48.146
Isn't it obvious? She made me...

13:48.787 --> 13:50.410
...tall!

13:50.510 --> 13:52.512
Oh, that's a problem?

13:53.673 --> 13:55.955
It's just not who I am, love.

13:56.276 --> 14:00.561
And more importantly, it's taken away
my power to dole out luck too.

14:00.961 --> 14:05.886
Is there any way you could
turn me back? Please.

14:07.168 --> 14:08.749
Okay.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.972
I'm sure I can improvise something.

14:13.135 --> 14:15.157
<i>You who found me in this bar</i>

14:15.257 --> 14:17.659
<i>Turn back to who you really are</i>

14:24.427 --> 14:26.589
God bless you, Paige.

14:26.909 --> 14:30.453
The name is Riley,
and I'm forever in your debt.

14:30.553 --> 14:32.696
Great. You're welcome,
but if you don't mind,

14:32.796 --> 14:34.778
you probably should get out of here.

14:34.879 --> 14:38.682
Not before I leave you
with a token of my appreciation.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.464
Thank you.

14:40.564 --> 14:43.028
Hope you get that wicked witch.

14:43.128 --> 14:45.130
I'll try.

14:59.025 --> 15:01.748
Okay, let's do this.
I have a future to get back to.

15:02.188 --> 15:06.273
- Who doesn't? Did you bless this?
- Yes, I blessed it, I sang to it.

15:06.593 --> 15:09.376
What's the matter with you?
You okay?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.378
I think I'm just coming down
with something.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.480
What do you mean,
from the attack?

15:14.361 --> 15:16.404
Now who's the worrywart?

15:17.045 --> 15:19.187
We still need Paige to bless this.
Did you call her?

15:19.287 --> 15:21.850
Yeah, she's on her way.
She was helping me out at the club.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.792
Who's watching Wyatt?

15:23.892 --> 15:26.636
Sheila. He should be safe there
till after this is over.

15:26.736 --> 15:28.918
Okay, well, we gotta get
a move on here,

15:29.018 --> 15:31.480
because I need to find
my husband, like, yesterday.

15:31.581 --> 15:33.042
Seriously.

15:33.142 --> 15:35.865
What? I did the math. It's gonna
take me like a year to fall in love,

15:36.185 --> 15:38.689
and then there's the whole
engagement and the wedding.

15:38.789 --> 15:41.572
Then a year of wedded bliss.
Then I have to wait a year to find out

15:41.672 --> 15:43.293
if I really wanna have his kid.

15:43.393 --> 15:45.736
And then the pregnancy's
like nine months.

15:45.836 --> 15:48.139
Well, ten months.
They just tell you it's nine months.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.802
So clearly, let's move on here.

15:51.122 --> 15:53.725
- I'm sorry, what's so funny?
- This whole family needs a shrink.

15:55.046 --> 15:57.048
What...?

15:57.409 --> 16:00.533
- Hey, where'd you get that?
- Don't ask.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.715
You need to bless
this vanquishing potion.

16:02.815 --> 16:04.517
Oh, hello to you too.

16:04.617 --> 16:06.919
<i>Hey, the Book says</i>
<i>for all three of you to bless it.</i>

16:07.019 --> 16:09.783
Phoebe will help you.
Piper, can I talk to you, please?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.606
"Piper"? What happened to "Mom"?

16:12.706 --> 16:14.608
How exactly do I bless this thing?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.950
With your blood. Come on.

16:19.753 --> 16:21.876
This will just hurt a little.

16:23.117 --> 16:25.119
What is it?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.702
What's the matter?

16:27.802 --> 16:30.766
- Chris, your eyes are dilated.
- Are they?

16:45.862 --> 16:49.306
Okay, we got it,
and she didn't even faint.

16:50.988 --> 16:52.991
What are you doing?

17:05.364 --> 17:06.825
Get it!

17:06.925 --> 17:08.928
Get it.

17:11.971 --> 17:13.973
Piper.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.579
Oh, no.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.658
Well, there's a force field that works.

17:35.758 --> 17:37.780
All right, I locked Chris
in the basement.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.882
What are you doing on the floor?

17:41.844 --> 17:43.545
Well, I'm not having a lot of luck,

17:43.646 --> 17:46.489
that's why I'm on the floor.
I've tried orbs, knives, spells.

17:49.332 --> 17:52.255
- God, I hope Piper's okay in there.
- Don't.

17:54.538 --> 17:56.540
So do you think we should
ask Chris for help?

17:57.061 --> 18:00.264
Yeah, let's get the mutant who put
her in there in the first place to help.

18:00.585 --> 18:03.327
Missy, that is our nephew.
He needs help too.

18:03.427 --> 18:07.111
Okay, fine. How should we help?
How about Leo?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.334
Are you kidding? Piper would kill us.

18:09.435 --> 18:12.057
Well, then she can kill us
after she's saved.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.961
Paige, Piper doesn't want Leo
to know that Chris is his son, okay?

18:16.281 --> 18:18.264
So I don't think I could
keep that secret.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.367
Try. Leo!

18:22.649 --> 18:24.351
Phoebe, Paige. How are you?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.793
Well, not so good.
We have a problem.

18:26.893 --> 18:28.755
Perhaps we should meditate.

18:28.855 --> 18:31.038
No, I don't wanna meditate.

18:31.138 --> 18:33.140
Piper, right there.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.926
The Spider Demon.

18:39.026 --> 18:41.029
She cocoons her victims
before feeding on them.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.732
Great, well, can you get her
out of there?

18:43.832 --> 18:47.196
Well, the only way to get her out of
there is to vanquish the Spider Demon.

18:47.516 --> 18:52.001
But it's okay. The cocoon is meant
for preservation, so she's safe for now.

18:52.482 --> 18:54.664
Good, that means Chris is too.

18:54.764 --> 18:57.187
Chris. He's... He's in there too?

18:57.287 --> 18:59.609
No, he's not in there, Leo.
He's in the basement.

18:59.929 --> 19:02.753
Yeah, he was acting a little crazy
so I locked him in the basement.

19:02.853 --> 19:04.715
Yeah, after the Spider Demon
infected him.

19:04.815 --> 19:07.138
Kind of went a little crazy,
went after her.

19:07.978 --> 19:09.980
I'll talk to him.

19:10.621 --> 19:12.804
Be careful.

19:12.904 --> 19:14.906
Good thinking, yeah.

19:15.227 --> 19:16.969
I'm telling you,
he has a right to know.

19:17.069 --> 19:19.071
No, he doesn't.

19:21.513 --> 19:23.516
Chris?

19:29.042 --> 19:31.224
Chris?

19:31.324 --> 19:34.008
Chris, I'd like to talk to you.
It's Leo.

19:42.937 --> 19:44.940
Chris?

19:45.620 --> 19:47.622
Bastard!

19:52.387 --> 19:55.030
- What happened?
- He attacked me.

19:55.351 --> 19:57.393
- I tried to warn you.
- He's got issues.

19:57.874 --> 20:00.496
- Issues?
- Yeah, from being infected.

20:00.596 --> 20:02.879
No, I think his issues precede that,
don't you, Paige?

20:03.599 --> 20:05.021
Something you're not telling me?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.503
- Actually...
- No.

20:06.603 --> 20:09.486
Look, he's gonna find out
sooner or later, and I'm gonna bust.

20:09.847 --> 20:11.989
- Find out what?
- If he's gonna help us,

20:12.089 --> 20:14.511
- we're gonna have to tell him.
- It's Piper's business.

20:14.612 --> 20:16.614
Tell me what?

20:19.337 --> 20:21.339
Chris is your son.

20:24.543 --> 20:27.425
Don't we all feel better?
I know I feel so much better.

20:37.477 --> 20:38.979
How?

20:39.079 --> 20:42.643
Spirit realm, six months ago,
you and Piper...

20:42.963 --> 20:44.965
Leo, she's pregnant.

20:45.966 --> 20:47.428
Why didn't she tell me?

20:47.528 --> 20:51.292
Honestly, I think she knows how hard
it was for you to leave one son behind.

20:51.733 --> 20:54.015
She didn't want to make it
any harder.

20:56.057 --> 20:58.059
Great. Excuse me.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.923
Why is he so mad at me?

21:01.023 --> 21:03.245
I don't know, sweetie.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.988
He's real tight-lipped
about the future.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.672
It's a lot for you, huh?

21:10.634 --> 21:14.758
Well, you gotta try to pull it together
because we need you.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.782
Your family needs you.

21:18.882 --> 21:20.884
Right.

21:21.966 --> 21:24.889
- You're right.
- That's the spirit.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.933
Well, if I remember correctly,

21:29.254 --> 21:33.018
the Spider Demon's last victim
was a wizard.

21:33.419 --> 21:36.001
Maybe I should go to Magic School
and see if there's something

21:36.102 --> 21:37.363
I could use to scry for him.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.165
Okay, and what about Chris?

21:39.265 --> 21:41.247
<i>Check the Book.</i>
<i>I think there's an antidote.</i>

21:41.347 --> 21:43.350
Okay.

21:44.431 --> 21:46.433
Welcome home.

21:49.916 --> 21:52.379
Hey, will you watch Piper?
I have to go back to the club.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.581
Right now?

21:53.681 --> 21:56.204
Yeah, the wicked witch
has struck again.

22:00.088 --> 22:02.090
<i>Chris?</i>

22:03.131 --> 22:05.134
<i>Chris.</i>

22:06.495 --> 22:08.497
<i>Come to me, Chris.</i>

22:11.500 --> 22:13.402
<i>That's right.</i>

22:13.502 --> 22:15.505
<i>Over here.</i>

22:15.946 --> 22:17.948
<i>Come closer.</i>

22:28.359 --> 22:30.301
<i>You are learning quickly.</i>

22:30.401 --> 22:32.684
<i>- What did you do to me?</i>
<i>- I think you know.</i>

22:33.004 --> 22:35.006
<i>Now bring me the cocoon.</i>

22:35.807 --> 22:37.810
No.

22:40.853 --> 22:42.554
<i>You can't resist it,</i>

22:42.655 --> 22:44.356
<i>what's happening to you.</i>

22:44.456 --> 22:47.459
<i>Don't fight it.</i>
<i>Embrace your new powers.</i>

22:48.662 --> 22:51.785
<i>- Use them.</i>
<i>- I don't understand.</i>

22:52.145 --> 22:54.267
<i>You will, my sweet.</i>

22:54.868 --> 22:56.870
<i>All in good time.</i>

22:58.191 --> 23:00.194
<i>All in good time.</i>

23:07.602 --> 23:10.806
- Who did this, the wicked witch?
- No, actually, that was me.

23:11.206 --> 23:13.469
You? Why?

23:13.569 --> 23:15.971
I couldn't let him open the club,
let those people in here.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.233
Not until you turn me back
into a wood nymph.

23:18.334 --> 23:20.877
Okay, well, who's to say
there's not more coming after you?

23:20.977 --> 23:24.040
I cannot keep the club closed all night.
Piper will kill me.

23:24.140 --> 23:27.083
Cry me a river, sister.
We have lives too, you know.

23:27.183 --> 23:29.826
Without me,
nature falls out of harmony.

23:30.146 --> 23:33.110
Flowers wilt, trees wither,
streams dry up. It ain't pretty.

23:33.431 --> 23:35.453
- And this guy.
- Hi.

23:35.553 --> 23:37.014
He's an ogre.

23:37.114 --> 23:41.800
A giant, terrifying ogre. Tell me, does
he look imposing to you in the least?

23:43.242 --> 23:44.943
No, not... Not so much.

23:45.043 --> 23:48.006
- And me, I'm supposed to be a fairy.
- You see the problem.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.429
The witch's curse is spreading
like wildfire.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.512
Pretty soon there won't be
any magic folk left.

23:52.612 --> 23:55.775
No offence, but you don't sound like
any of the wood nymphs I've ever met.

23:56.136 --> 23:58.798
Oh, it's the curse, I'm telling you.
The curse.

23:58.898 --> 24:00.900
All right, all right.

24:02.862 --> 24:05.846
Paper and pen? What, are you
gonna write the witch a letter?

24:05.946 --> 24:09.230
Hey. I don't tell you how
to save the forest. No, I don't.

24:09.550 --> 24:11.772
Tell me everything you know
about the wicked witch

24:11.872 --> 24:14.516
so we can get rid of her
once and for all.

24:32.575 --> 24:34.577
Thank you. Thank you.

24:35.259 --> 24:36.760
Thank you.

24:36.861 --> 24:38.863
We owe you, Paige.

24:39.383 --> 24:42.366
Yeah. Great. Now, why don't
you guys get out of here

24:42.466 --> 24:46.231
because I know a witch who's gonna
really put a curse on me unless...

24:47.632 --> 24:51.096
What about this one, sir?
The wizard Rathmere.

24:51.196 --> 24:54.519
He created over 500 spells
and potions

24:54.840 --> 24:57.523
before mysteriously
disappearing in 1904.

24:58.004 --> 25:00.606
Sounds like the right year.
Any chance you have this wand here?

25:00.927 --> 25:02.929
It should be in the collection.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.992
Would you excuse us, please,
Sigmund?

25:06.092 --> 25:08.095
Of course.

25:08.616 --> 25:10.037
Not now.

25:10.137 --> 25:11.839
Leo, this is a serious matter...

25:11.939 --> 25:14.201
...and one that we have been over
countless times.

25:14.301 --> 25:16.884
You abandoned the other Elders
without so much as a warning.

25:16.984 --> 25:18.927
Yeah, well, something came up.

25:19.027 --> 25:21.830
You can't just pop on down
whenever you feel the need arise.

25:22.511 --> 25:26.354
You're not just putting yourself at risk,
you're putting all Elders at risk too.

25:26.755 --> 25:28.757
I'm trying to save my son.

25:29.198 --> 25:31.921
Wyatt? Has something
happened to him?

25:32.361 --> 25:35.805
No, not Wyatt. To Chris.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.850
I know, I just found out myself.
I don't have time to explain.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.793
If I don't find the demon who hurt him,
I may not figure out

25:42.893 --> 25:45.335
- why he hates me so much.
- Hates you.

25:46.697 --> 25:48.759
Got it. Listen, I dropped Wyatt off
in the nursery

25:48.859 --> 25:51.162
just to be on the safe side.
I hope that's all right.

25:51.262 --> 25:53.264
Of course.

25:56.147 --> 25:59.411
- Chris is his son too?
- Apparently.

25:59.511 --> 26:00.812
Actually, come to think of it,

26:00.912 --> 26:05.598
that does explain why he came all
the way from the future to save Wyatt.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.820
Save him from us, you mean.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.923
If he knew,
he wouldn't still be searching.

26:13.487 --> 26:16.650
When the time is right,
Wyatt will be sacrificed

26:16.970 --> 26:20.053
and the greater good
will be served.

26:24.299 --> 26:27.362
- Do you need anything else?
- No, sweetie.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.784
I just hope we're not too late.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.609
I stopped off in the attic
on the way back.

26:33.709 --> 26:36.432
I gotta tell you, Leo, whatever Chris
has against you in the future,

26:36.832 --> 26:39.335
it can't be your
lack of determination.

26:39.435 --> 26:42.578
Still, he might not be in this mess
if I hadn't been gone so long.

26:42.678 --> 26:44.681
Well, you have to do
what you have to do.

26:45.442 --> 26:48.485
My God, Leo. Can't you think
of anything but yourself?

26:48.845 --> 26:50.847
Phoebe.

26:51.168 --> 26:53.650
- Yeah, that was kind of weird.
- Yeah.

26:53.971 --> 26:55.974
You totally bailed on us!

26:56.774 --> 26:59.157
- What the hell?
- Okay.

26:59.257 --> 27:03.341
I think maybe I'm channelling
Chris' anger?

27:03.701 --> 27:06.826
But he's in the basement.
Can you empath from so far away?

27:07.146 --> 27:09.148
I don't know. Maybe my powers
are expanding?

27:09.708 --> 27:11.710
Or he's closer than we think.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.160
No!

27:29.010 --> 27:31.012
Chris, stop. This isn't you.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.435
Wanna bet?

27:34.535 --> 27:36.618
- Chris, don't.
- He's your father.

27:57.521 --> 28:01.085
Bug spray. We should have used
bug spray.

28:07.412 --> 28:09.654
Okay, I can't break free.
Can you orb?

28:09.974 --> 28:12.097
- No, I tried.
- Damn it.

28:12.498 --> 28:14.920
Are Elders even allowed to swear?

28:15.020 --> 28:18.143
No, but fathers are. Especially ones
whose kid tries to kill him.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.468
- Well, technically, you can't die.
- That's not the point.

28:21.788 --> 28:24.391
Well, it wasn't Chris, Leo,
it was a demon.

28:24.711 --> 28:26.993
No, some of it was Chris.
I saw it in his eyes.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.996
I think he's right.
I think that's why he can still orb.

28:31.358 --> 28:33.261
He can be saved.

28:33.361 --> 28:35.363
Yeah, well, can we?

28:37.365 --> 28:39.367
Maybe with a little luck.

28:40.768 --> 28:42.770
Shillelagh.

28:50.539 --> 28:52.581
- Somebody called?
- Hey.

28:52.901 --> 28:54.904
Over here.

28:57.107 --> 28:59.489
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

28:59.589 --> 29:02.112
Yeah, thanks a lot. Can you just get us
down from here, please?

29:03.513 --> 29:08.599
I can try, but, as you know,
luck can go either way. Good or bad.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.722
- You take your chances.
- Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.045
Very well.

29:23.775 --> 29:26.019
I tried to warn you, love.

29:33.586 --> 29:35.628
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

29:35.949 --> 29:37.952
Thanks to you
for showing me how.

29:39.233 --> 29:42.757
- Now what?
- You've been ever so helpful.

29:43.838 --> 29:47.041
But if you don't mind,
I prefer to dine alone.

29:56.732 --> 29:58.735
So divine.

30:02.859 --> 30:04.881
What's happening?

30:04.981 --> 30:07.063
I gather you weren't
counting on this.

30:07.784 --> 30:10.387
It's not just her magic
I'm feeding on.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.792
It's her baby's too.

30:16.233 --> 30:18.235
Yours.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.344
I don't understand why it's not working.
Maybe I have the wrong wizard.

30:26.445 --> 30:29.848
Or maybe because
there's nothing to find.

30:31.010 --> 30:35.495
Leo, you gotta stop beating yourself up
over this, okay? It's not your fault.

30:35.975 --> 30:38.257
I just... I don't understand
why he hates me so much.

30:38.578 --> 30:40.039
Yeah, but, Leo, it's in the future.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.282
It hasn't happened yet,
so you can change it.

30:42.383 --> 30:45.426
If Chris lives long enough
to tell me what to change.

30:47.147 --> 30:49.650
Wait. Why am I scrying
for the wizard?

30:49.750 --> 30:51.752
The demon has Piper.
I should be scrying for her.

30:52.674 --> 30:54.876
Here, use her keys.

31:02.324 --> 31:04.146
- Got her.
- Okay, I'll take the antidote,

31:04.247 --> 31:06.249
you take the vanquishing potion.
Paige!

31:06.769 --> 31:08.711
- Piper didn't bless it.
- It's all we've got.

31:08.811 --> 31:11.013
We need the power of three.
How will we make up for Piper?

31:11.614 --> 31:14.218
Well, how about with a little help
from our friends?

31:21.024 --> 31:23.087
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

31:23.187 --> 31:25.590
- So, wait, we can't get in?
- No, it's impenetrable.

31:26.231 --> 31:28.853
- Great plan.
- Well, maybe we can draw her out.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.095
How's that?

31:30.195 --> 31:32.197
I could just knock.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.961
Good thinking.

31:41.127 --> 31:43.129
Damn it.

31:43.449 --> 31:45.771
Can't a demon eat in peace?

31:57.866 --> 31:59.988
You're pissing me off, you know?

32:00.308 --> 32:02.410
Yeah, that's the idea.

32:02.510 --> 32:04.532
You think you can take me?

32:04.632 --> 32:07.917
- Without your sister?
- We're just gonna have to see.

32:10.079 --> 32:12.081
Now!

32:22.773 --> 32:24.775
Step on her.

32:29.300 --> 32:31.242
That's gross.

32:31.342 --> 32:33.344
Sorry.

32:40.112 --> 32:41.574
Give me the antidote.

32:41.674 --> 32:43.175
No.

32:43.275 --> 32:45.397
This is my responsibility.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.422
Piper, are you okay?

32:50.523 --> 32:52.425
I think so.

32:52.526 --> 32:55.048
What...? What are you doing here?

32:55.489 --> 32:58.852
It's a long story.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.936
What's that?

33:05.900 --> 33:07.902
Our little boy.

33:10.465 --> 33:12.468
You gotta get out of here.

33:18.754 --> 33:21.076
Well, hey. Welcome back.

33:21.397 --> 33:23.400
Where's Leo?

33:28.204 --> 33:30.367
Chris, come on. Can we just
talk about this a minute?

33:30.687 --> 33:32.709
A minute?

33:32.809 --> 33:35.213
We have the next hundred years.

33:46.745 --> 33:49.468
- I can't get through that thing.
- You want me to try knocking again?

33:50.269 --> 33:53.312
- I don't think that'll work this time.
- It's okay, we'll take it from here.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.735
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're positive.

33:55.835 --> 33:57.837
But thanks for everything.

34:04.604 --> 34:07.528
- I told you guys not to bring Leo here.
- I think he just saved your life.

34:07.848 --> 34:10.210
Yeah, at his expense
and maybe Chris' too.

34:14.094 --> 34:18.139
Well, at least we'll have plenty of time
to get to know each other. Dad.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.202
You see, that's what
I'm talking about.

34:20.302 --> 34:22.784
That's not the demon talking,
that's you talking, Chris.

34:23.105 --> 34:25.087
It's not too late,
you just have to fight it.

34:25.187 --> 34:27.188
Why fight when I've already won?

34:31.474 --> 34:33.476
Tell me why you hate me
so much, Chris.

34:34.677 --> 34:36.659
What did I do to become
such a bad dad?

34:36.760 --> 34:39.362
- It doesn't matter anymore.
- No?

34:40.204 --> 34:41.786
The hell it doesn't.

34:41.886 --> 34:43.888
Deep down, you hate my guts.

34:45.569 --> 34:48.192
Admit it. Come on, admit it.

34:48.292 --> 34:50.696
What? Are you afraid?

34:51.056 --> 34:52.918
- I'm not afraid of you.
- No?

34:53.018 --> 34:55.040
Then why don't you tell me
what I did to you?

34:55.139 --> 34:57.582
What, did I miss a school play?

34:58.503 --> 35:00.506
Did I take away your favourite toy?

35:02.068 --> 35:04.070
Did I play favourites with Wyatt?

35:09.956 --> 35:12.139
Chris, don't.

35:12.239 --> 35:14.241
You don't know me.

35:18.886 --> 35:21.328
- Paige, you should take the antidote.
- No, no. I'm fine.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.432
It didn't even break my skin.
Just hurts.

35:23.532 --> 35:26.475
- Yeah, but still...
- No, we need to save it for Chris.

35:26.575 --> 35:28.276
Paige.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.238
- What's the matter?
- Kidney shot.

35:30.338 --> 35:32.742
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something.

35:33.503 --> 35:35.525
Maybe he is.

35:35.625 --> 35:37.046
- Give me that.
- What? Why?

35:37.146 --> 35:39.008
- So I can take it.
- What?

35:39.108 --> 35:41.651
Whatever happens to little Chris
happens to big Chris.

35:41.751 --> 35:43.894
- That's what you've been worried about.
- So?

35:43.994 --> 35:47.017
So if I take this, the baby's inoculated
and Chris is just fine, right?

35:47.117 --> 35:48.859
- Do you follow that?
- Not a word.

35:48.959 --> 35:50.961
Just give it to me.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.547
You don't know me.
You don't know me.

35:55.647 --> 35:57.649
You don't know me!

36:08.541 --> 36:11.384
Chris! No!

36:12.945 --> 36:15.449
Chris! Chris, look at me.

36:15.549 --> 36:16.250
Chris! Chris, look at me.

36:16.350 --> 36:18.352
It's okay. It's over.

36:51.508 --> 36:54.591
You gotta eat all your vegetables
and brush your teeth every day.

36:55.312 --> 36:57.594
And don't forget to play a lot.

36:59.757 --> 37:03.441
- Are these the last of them?
- Yeah, thank you.

37:08.807 --> 37:10.810
You're suffocating the boy.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.454
It's just, you know...

37:15.775 --> 37:16.996
Overcompensating?

37:17.096 --> 37:19.960
No, l... I just...

37:20.060 --> 37:21.802
...miss him a lot.

37:21.902 --> 37:23.804
I know.

37:23.904 --> 37:26.006
So you think you're gonna be
all right here?

37:26.106 --> 37:28.949
I mean, at least until after
the baby's born?

37:29.269 --> 37:30.972
Yeah, I think so.

37:31.072 --> 37:33.715
And Gideon's right.
This is the safest place for me,

37:34.035 --> 37:36.197
and that's the most
important thing, right?

37:37.478 --> 37:39.701
- I think so.
- Besides, I'm only an orb away

37:39.801 --> 37:41.463
if the girls need me.

37:41.564 --> 37:44.927
No, I told them to call me first.

37:45.327 --> 37:48.651
You? You're not
going back up there?

37:50.332 --> 37:51.794
No.

37:51.894 --> 37:53.877
My family needs me here right now.

37:53.977 --> 37:56.299
Yes, we do.

37:58.341 --> 38:01.144
You know, Leo,
you can get through to him.

38:01.465 --> 38:03.468
You just can't give up.

38:03.788 --> 38:05.790
He's just as stubborn as you are.

38:09.314 --> 38:11.316
Okay, can you wave goodbye?

38:12.797 --> 38:14.800
Okay, let's go.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.406
Come on. Let's go.

38:35.142 --> 38:37.265
Take good care of them,
Gideon, will you?

38:38.346 --> 38:40.348
Absolutely.

39:17.028 --> 39:19.091
Hi. Place is hopping, huh?

39:19.191 --> 39:22.314
Yeah. Not a bad guy over there.
Is that Nick?

39:22.634 --> 39:24.376
No, actually, that's Ron.

39:24.476 --> 39:26.778
What, we skipped some letters
in the alphabet?

39:26.879 --> 39:28.881
- Q's are hard to find.
- I hear you.

39:29.682 --> 39:31.684
- Well, at least he's handsome.
- He's cute, right?

39:32.125 --> 39:34.287
Okay. Have fun. Bye.

39:35.528 --> 39:37.530
Hi.

39:38.812 --> 39:42.016
Okay. Drinks on the house.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.437
All right.

39:43.537 --> 39:46.460
God bless you, love.

39:47.742 --> 39:49.864
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:21.899 --> 40:23.902
Can we talk?

40:24.222 --> 40:26.224
There is nothing to talk about.

40:27.065 --> 40:29.067
I think there is.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.610
Quite a bit, actually.

40:31.710 --> 40:32.931
It doesn't matter.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.034
It does to me, Chris.

40:35.875 --> 40:37.016
You're my son.

40:37.116 --> 40:40.880
I think I deserve to know what I did
that's so bad.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.086
You were never there for me.

40:46.967 --> 40:49.169
You were there for everybody else.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.492
For Mom...

40:51.932 --> 40:54.615
...Wyatt, half the world.

40:55.055 --> 40:57.058
But you were never there for me.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.502
You didn't have the time.

41:02.504 --> 41:04.286
So...

41:04.386 --> 41:07.029
...maybe you came back
from the future not just to save Wyatt.

41:08.951 --> 41:10.953
Maybe you came back
to save us too.

41:13.356 --> 41:15.358
I doubt it.
