WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.105
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

00:04.105 --> 00:05.973
WELL, THE KIDS ARE BOTH BUSY.

00:05.973 --> 00:09.143
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD SPEND
SOME ALONE TIME TOGETHER.

00:09.143 --> 00:14.148
GEORGE LIKE ALONE TIME.
MAKE GEORGE HAPPY.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.750
MAYBE AFTER DINNER,

00:16.750 --> 00:20.988
WE COULD CRAWL INTO BED EARLY,
WATCH A DVD.

00:20.988 --> 00:24.125
YOU COULD PICK ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.594
WHAT ABOUT
A STEVEN SEAGAL MOVIE?

00:26.594 --> 00:30.098
BUT ONE OF THE EARLY ONES
BEFORE HE GOT TOO FAT TO KICK.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.871
WHATEVER YOU WANT,
AS LONG AS YOU'RE FREE TONIGHT.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.108
I'M ALL YOURS.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.144
GOOD. MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TIME
FOR THE MOVIE

00:43.144 --> 00:45.646
AFTER MAX'S SCHOOL ASSEMBLY.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.882
SCHOOL ASSEMBLY?!

00:48.882 --> 00:51.685
YOU TRICKED ME!
I'M NOT GOIN'.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.688
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN GO BY
YOURSELF AND SIT IN THE BACK ROW

00:54.688 --> 00:56.690
WITH ALL THE OTHER
SINGLE MOTHERS

00:56.690 --> 00:59.627
WHO DROVE THEIR MEN AWAY
WITH LIES.

00:59.627 --> 01:03.264
"I'M ON THE PILL, DON'T WORRY."
ESTÃ¡S LOCA.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.033
THIS IS FOR MAX.
WE'RE BOTH GOING.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.535
WHAT'S THE MEETING ABOUT,
ANYWAY?

01:07.535 --> 01:09.203
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY SAID
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.638
"IMPORTANT."

01:10.638 --> 01:13.841
AT THE LAST MEETING,
THERE WAS A MAN IN A DOG SUIT.

01:13.841 --> 01:17.077
THAT WAS SERGEANT SNIFFER,
THE POLICE DOG.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.847
"DON'T GET HOOKED, KIDS,

01:19.847 --> 01:23.717
"'CAUSE GETTIN' OFF DRUGS
IS RUFF, RUFF, RUFF."

01:23.717 --> 01:28.088
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOW.
YOU'RE GOING.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.392
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I'LL GO,

01:31.392 --> 01:33.161
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS
THAT ANNOYING LADY THERE

01:33.161 --> 01:36.130
THAT JUST LOVES TO HEAR HERSELF
TALK THE WHOLE... (mutters)

01:36.130 --> 01:37.731
I WISH I COULD LEAVE

01:37.731 --> 01:39.833
BEFORE SHE STARTS ASKING
ALL THOSE STUPID QUESTIONS.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.603
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU?
'CAUSE I GOTTA DRIVE HER HOME!
VÃ¡MANOS!

01:47.475 --> 01:49.710
THIS PLACE IS HALF EMPTY.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.579
USUALLY, IT'S TOUGH
TO FIND A SEAT.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.847
HELLO, I'M PRINCIPAL STAHLER.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.818
I WANTED TO TALK TO A VERY
SELECT GROUP OF PARENTS TONIGHT.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.688
YEAH, THEY DIDN'T INVITE
ALL THE LOSERS THIS TIME.

02:00.688 --> 02:04.625
YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE
NONE OF YOU ATTENDED COLLEGE.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.726
(all groan)

02:05.726 --> 02:08.596
STRIKE THAT, ANGIE.
WE'RE THE LOSERS!

02:08.596 --> 02:10.731
HOW DO THEY KNOW
WE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.833
THEY ASKED US IN CLASS
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.904
I WAS JUST HAPPY I KNEW
THE ANSWER TO SOMETHING.

02:16.904 --> 02:21.141
THIS IS IN NO WAY MEANT
TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON ANYONE,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.910
BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

02:22.910 --> 02:25.279
THAT CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS
DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE

02:25.279 --> 02:27.615
ARE LESS LIKELY TO GO,
THEMSELVES.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.918
WAIT, SO BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT

02:30.918 --> 02:32.753
WE'RE ALL STUPID.

02:32.753 --> 02:39.159
NO, SIR. I-I JUST SAID I DON'T
MEAN TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON YOU.

02:42.530 --> 02:46.800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.903
I AM NOT TRYING
TO INSULT ANYONE.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.240
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT,
BECAUSE Â¿SABÃ©S QUE?

02:52.240 --> 02:55.376
I GOT ASPERSIONS ALL OVER ME
AND WHATNOT.

02:57.144 --> 03:00.013
LOOK, WE ARE JUST TRYING
TO ENCOURAGE YOU

03:00.013 --> 03:04.051
TO GIVE YOUR SON A BETTER CHANCE
TO SUCCEED.

03:04.051 --> 03:07.087
YOU DON'T NEED A COLLEGE DEGREE
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.856
I MANAGE A WHOLE FACTORY,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.824
AND I DID IT WITHOUT HAVING
A COLLEGE DEGREE.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.993
OKAY, I DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

03:12.993 --> 03:15.996
TO LEARN HOW TO BINGE DRINK
AND THROW UP ON MY FRIENDS.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.199
I LEARNED THAT BY JUST
GETTING OUT THERE AND DOING IT.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.935
COME ON, ANGIE,
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.905
GIVE ME THE KEYS... UNLESS
I'M TOO DUMB TO FIGURE OUT

03:24.905 --> 03:27.341
HOW TO DRIVE MY OWN CAR.
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.942
I DON'T HAVE THE KEYS.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.944
DON'T TELL ME YOU LOCKED
THEM IN THE CAR AGAIN.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.682
ALL RIGHT, WHO HERE CAN
HELP ME BREAK INTO A CAR?

03:34.682 --> 03:38.018
COME ON, NONE OF YOU WENT TO
COLLEGE. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KNOW!

03:38.018 --> 03:40.754
COME ON, FOOL, LET'S GO.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.627
HEY, HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

03:46.627 --> 03:48.128
THERE WAS A SCHOOL ASSEMBLY
LAST NIGHT?

03:48.128 --> 03:52.032
MAN, YOU KNOW I LIKE TO GO
TROLLING FOR SINGLE MOTHERS!

03:52.032 --> 03:53.301
YOU DON'T TALK TO 'EM ANYWAY.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.336
YOU JUST STAND AROUND
BY THE SNACK TABLE

03:55.336 --> 03:58.005
STUFFIN' YOUR FACE
WITH COOKIES.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.673
HEY, THAT'S BECAUSE A COOKIE

03:59.673 --> 04:01.475
NEVER WOKE UP IN BED
NEXT TO ME AND CRIED,

04:01.475 --> 04:04.745
"WHAT HAVE I DONE?!
I GOTTA STOP DRINKING!"

04:06.714 --> 04:08.716
IT WASN'T A REGULAR ASSEMBLY,
ANYWAY.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.851
IT WAS ONLY FOR PARENTS
WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.220
THEY'RE TRYING TO INSPIRE
OUR KIDS

04:13.220 --> 04:15.823
BY TELLIN' THEM
THAT WE'RE ALL IDIOTS.

04:15.823 --> 04:21.228
SO WHEN THEY TELL YOU YOU'RE
AN IDIOT, IT'S INSPIRATIONAL,

04:21.228 --> 04:24.532
BUT WHEN I DO IT,
I'M A BAD MOTHER.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.934
THEY DIDN'T YELL AT ME
DURING POTTY TRAINING.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.569
NOW WHEN I HAVE TROUBLE,

04:28.569 --> 04:32.373
I CAN'T GO UNLESS I YELL AT
MYSELF, "COME ON, YOU IDIOT!"

04:32.373 --> 04:34.608
GEORGE, I WANT YOU TO MEET
RICK MARTINEZ.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.811
HE'S A CONSULTANT. HE'S GONNA
HELP US FIND SOME WAYS

04:37.811 --> 04:40.113
TO CHOP THE BUDGET
DOWN TO SIZE.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.182
WELL, I'M GONNA
CUT TO THE CHASE.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.053
I WILL SLEEP WITH YOU
TO KEEP MY JOB.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.992
THAT DIDN'T WORK
DURING THE DEPRESSION,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.927
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK NOW.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.564
NICE TO MEET YOU, RICK,
BUT, UH, OUR BUDGET'S FINE.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.266
THE ONLY THING
WE'RE WASTING MONEY ON

04:59.266 --> 05:02.336
IS AN EXPENSIVE CONSULTANT.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.938
DON'T GET ALL THREATENED. RICK
ISN'T HERE TO TAKE YOUR JOB.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.941
HE'S WAY OVERQUALIFIED
FOR THAT.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.778
NOW, IF RICK FELL DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

05:10.778 --> 05:13.246
AND LOST HALF
OF HIS BRAIN FUNCTION, THEN...

05:13.246 --> 05:14.615
NOPE!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.884
STILL OVERQUALIFIED.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.520
SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO SEE
THE BUDGETS

05:19.520 --> 05:21.121
FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.924
GEORGE, I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.560
I STARTED OFF IN A FACTORY
JUST LIKE THIS.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.962
REALLY? AND YOU WORKED
YOUR WAY UP, HUH?

05:28.962 --> 05:32.299
NO. IT WAS A PART-TIME JOB
WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.068
COLLEGE BOY.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.305
HEY, SO WHAT WOULD A RICH KID
BE DOIN' WORKIN' IN A FACTORY?

05:38.305 --> 05:41.008
RICH? I GREW UP
IN BOYLE HEIGHTS.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.911
COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT 'CAUSE
OF THE POLICE HELICOPTERS.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.979
YEAH, WELL,
MY FATHER ABANDONED US,

05:45.979 --> 05:48.281
SO I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR
THE POLICE HELICOPTERS.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.151
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME A GROWN MAN
EVER GAVE ME GUIDANCE--

05:51.151 --> 05:54.221
"GET BACK IN THE HOUSE, SON!"

05:54.221 --> 05:55.989
I DIDN'T HAVE A DAD, EITHER.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.358
HE DIED AND MY MOM
HAD TO SUPPORT US.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.960
YEAH, WELL,
MY MOM HAD TO WORK TWO JOBS,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.862
AND I HAD
A LEARNING DISABILITY.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.931
DYSLEXIA? ME, TOO!
YEAH.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.799
Ã³RALE.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.035
WOW. WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.937
YEAH, YOU GUYS STARTED OUT
THE SAME,

06:09.937 --> 06:12.706
AND THEN, RICK, YOU KNOW,
DID A LOT BETTER.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.009
HEY, BUT YOU COULD HAVE DONE
JUST AS WELL

06:16.009 --> 06:18.912
IF YOU'D HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE,
GEORGE.
YEAH, I WOULD HAVE,

06:18.912 --> 06:21.014
BUT I GOT MARRIED
RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

06:21.014 --> 06:25.986
THIS IS MY WIFE ANGIE.
WAA-PAAH!

06:25.986 --> 06:31.692
WOW. SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
YOU ARE A LUCKY GUY.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.528
THANK YOU, RICK.
HEY, UH, YOU MARRIED?

06:34.528 --> 06:37.064
YEP. 15 YEARS.
MET HER IN COLLEGE.

06:37.064 --> 06:41.669
OH, YOU MET HER IN COLLEGE?
THAT'S NICE.

06:41.669 --> 06:45.473
COME ON, MAN,
LET'S SEE THE PICTURE, DUDE.

06:48.308 --> 06:51.011
GEORGE, UH,
LET'S NOT DO THIS.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.814
OH, COME ON, WHY NOT?
YOU WENT TO COLLEGE, HUH?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.016
YOU GOT A GOOD JOB.
IT DOESN'T MATTER

06:56.016 --> 06:59.152
IF MY WIFE IS HOTTER THAN YOURS.
DUDE, IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.626
I CAN NEVER WIN NOTHING!

07:09.997 --> 07:15.268
OH, MAN, IS SHE THE GIRL
FROM THE BEER COMMERCIALS?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.037
SHE DOES A LITTLE MODELING.

07:17.037 --> 07:21.141
CHALE, YOU SEEN HER NAKED
AND EVERYTHING?!
(George) DUDE.

07:21.141 --> 07:26.446
OH, I'M SORRY. THAT WAS, UM,
THAT WAS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.281
ERNIE!

07:28.281 --> 07:29.583
WHAT?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.985
GIVE ME THAT PICTURE OF...
(speaks Spanish)

07:35.623 --> 07:38.058
RICK, I HOPE THIS
ISN'T OUT OF LINE,

07:38.058 --> 07:41.394
BUT SHE'S HAD SOME
REALLY NICE WORK DONE.

07:41.394 --> 07:45.098
THEY'RE REAL.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.770
SHOULDA GONE TO COLLEGE!

07:51.605 --> 07:54.875
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:58.411 --> 08:00.213
* ALL MY FRIENDS

08:00.213 --> 08:03.651
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

08:05.452 --> 08:06.820
* THE LOW RIDER

08:06.820 --> 08:10.490
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

08:22.435 --> 08:26.073
HEY, HONEY,
HOW WAS WORK TODAY?

08:26.073 --> 08:30.077
JACK BROUGHT IN THIS CONSULTANT,
RICK MARTINEZ.

08:30.077 --> 08:33.747
THE GUY IS PERFECT, ANGIE--
SMART, CONFIDENT, SUCCESSFUL.

08:33.747 --> 08:37.150
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON HIM.

08:37.150 --> 08:41.488
ANGIE, PLEASE, RICK IS
SO OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

08:41.488 --> 08:48.061
COME ON, YOU'RE EXAGGERATING.
NO ONE'S BETTER THAN MY MAN.

08:48.061 --> 08:53.000
OH, YEAH? YOU SHOULD SEE
WHAT HIS WIFE LOOKS LIKE.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.235
HE GAVE YOU A PICTURE
OF HIS WIFE?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.705
NO, WHEN HE WENT TO LUNCH,
ERNIE STOLE IT

08:57.705 --> 09:00.674
AND MADE A BUNCH OF COPIES.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.711
WOW! SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.980
I'M GONNA NEED THAT BACK.
I GOTTA GET IT SIGNED

09:06.980 --> 09:09.650
TOMORROW NIGHT
AT THE CAR SHOW.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.484
HEY, CARMEN.
HI.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.021
WHERE'S MAX? YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO PICK HIM UP AFTER SCHOOL.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.089
I WENT THERE, BUT THEY SAID
HE WAS OUT SICK TODAY.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.627
HE'S NOT SICK.
DIDN'T HE HAVE A BIG TEST TODAY?

09:19.627 --> 09:22.830
OH, NO,
I BET HE DITCHED CLASS.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.066
WHY DON'T YOU SEND HIM AWAY,

09:26.066 --> 09:27.768
AND THEN IT'LL BE JUST
THE THREE OF US

09:27.768 --> 09:29.569
LIKE IT WAS BACK IN
THE GOOD OLD DAYS?

09:29.569 --> 09:33.040
THAT'S FUNNY, CARMEN, 'CAUSE
BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.575
I REMEMBER THERE WAS
JUST TWO OF US.

09:39.980 --> 09:45.185
GO TO YOUR ROOM.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR BROTHER.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.954
SHOULD WE DO
GOOD COP, BAD COP?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.889
YEAH,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TONIGHT,

09:48.889 --> 09:51.892
BUT RIGHT NOW
LET'S DEAL WITH MAX.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.762
HEY, MAX, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.764
YEAH, WHY?

09:56.764 --> 09:59.933
OH, MY GOD.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

10:01.368 --> 10:05.438
APPARENTLY, SOMEONE
IN YOUR CLASS MISSED A TEST,

10:05.438 --> 10:08.575
AND YOUR TEACHER MRS. SANCHEZ
GOT WORRIED

10:08.575 --> 10:10.043
AND SHE WENT LOOKING.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.979
YEAH, SHE WENT TO THAT PIZZA
PLACE ACROSS FROM THE SCHOOL

10:11.979 --> 10:13.546
TO SEE IF THE KID WAS THERE.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.617
BUT, UH, UH, A PIT BULL
CHASED HER IN THE STREET,

10:17.617 --> 10:22.189
AND, PALO, SHE GOT HIT
BY A BUS.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.457
WHAT?!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.759
WHAT?

10:25.759 --> 10:29.529
BUT SHE'S STILL OKAY,
RIGHT?

10:29.529 --> 10:31.164
WELL, SHE WAS, BUT...

10:31.164 --> 10:33.600
THE AMBULANCE THAT CAME
TO GET HER

10:33.600 --> 10:36.804
DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS STILL
IN THE STREET, VATO, AND PALO,

10:36.804 --> 10:38.839
IT HIT HER AGAIN.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.142
I JUST DITCHED
TO GO TO THE ARCADE.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.046
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE'D GO LOOKING FOR ME.
AAH!

10:46.046 --> 10:47.815
BUSTED!

10:47.815 --> 10:50.918
YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN TO SKIP SCHOOL.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.619
IT WAS ONLY ONE DAY.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.254
MAX, YOU MISSED A TEST!

10:54.254 --> 10:56.189
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
IF I MISSED THE TEST?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.826
I'M NOT GOIN' TO COLLEGE,
ANYWAY.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.160
YES, YOU ARE.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.194
YOU DIDN'T.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.396
EXCUSE ME, I DECIDED
TO RAISE A FAMILY.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.965
I STILL MIGHT GO SOMEDAY.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.200
DAD SAID YOU DON'T NEED TO,
SO I'M NOT GOING.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.837
HEY, DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT
I SAID, OKAY? I WAS WRONG.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.805
YOU KNOW, TODAY, I MET A GUY

11:11.805 --> 11:13.874
WHO HAS THE SAME
EXACT BACKGROUND AS I DO,

11:13.874 --> 11:15.909
EXCEPT HE WENT TO COLLEGE
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

11:15.909 --> 11:18.812
HE'S GOT A BETTER JOB,
A NICER HOUSE, UH, MAY I?

11:18.812 --> 11:21.681
GO AHEAD.

11:21.681 --> 11:26.286
A SMOKIN' HOT WIFE--
MAX...

11:26.286 --> 11:29.322
TRUST ME, MAN,
YOU GOTTA GO TO COLLEGE!

11:29.322 --> 11:30.758
I HATE THIS!

11:30.758 --> 11:32.492
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO GET INTO COLLEGE.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.294
LOOK, I USED TO THINK
THE SAME THING, BUT NOW I KNOW

11:34.294 --> 11:36.596
IF I HAD WORKED HARDER,
I COULDA GOTTEN THROUGH IT.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.733
YEAH, RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T GO.
I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.803
OH, SO THAT'S HOW IT IS, HUH?
IF I WENT TO COLLEGE, YOU'D GO?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.973
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T GO,
SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.809
THEN HERE IT IS--
I'M GOIN' TO COLLEGE

11:48.809 --> 11:50.543
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO ARE YOU.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.081
ANGIE, CALL HARVARD
AND GET 'EM ON THE LINE.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.885
GET 'EM ON THE LINE!

11:59.787 --> 12:03.023
YOU'RE REALLY GOIN'
TO COLLEGE?
DAMN RIGHT, I AM,
AND SO ARE YOU,

12:03.023 --> 12:05.926
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN I PUT MY MIND TO SOMETHING,

12:05.926 --> 12:09.162
I DO IT, THAT'S IT!

12:09.162 --> 12:11.364
OKAY, HOW DO I
GET OUT OF THIS?

12:11.364 --> 12:14.067
YOU'RE THE COLLEGE MAN.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.502
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?!

12:15.502 --> 12:18.171
WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA SET

12:18.171 --> 12:20.040
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOUR KIDS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.043
WHEN I STARTED TALKING AND YOU
STARTED FEELING PROUD OF ME,

12:23.043 --> 12:25.979
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.118
GEORGE,
I WENT ON THE INTERNET

12:31.118 --> 12:33.686
AND FOUND AN APPLICATION
FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.955
HERE, I PRINTED IT OUT
FOR YOU.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.024
YOU KNOW, ANGIE,

12:37.024 --> 12:38.758
I DON'T THINK WE REALLY
HAVE THE MONEY

12:38.758 --> 12:40.460
FOR ME TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.395
IT'S ONLY $28 A UNIT.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.598
WELL, YOU KNOW, ANGIE, I DON'T
REALLY THINK I HAVE THE TIME

12:45.598 --> 12:47.134
TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.102
IT'S ONLY TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.438
CLOTHES!
I DON'T HAVE THE CLOTHES!

12:51.438 --> 12:55.142
HONEY, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE NERVOUS,

12:55.142 --> 12:56.543
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.

12:56.543 --> 13:00.080
YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE
A COLLEGE GRADUATE.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.582
BUT I HATED SCHOOL, ANGIE.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.285
I MEAN, I SUCKED AT IT
BECAUSE OF MY DYSLEXIA,

13:05.285 --> 13:07.287
I HID BEHIND THIS FAT KID
IN CLASS

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
SO THEY WOULDN'T CALL ON ME,
THEN ONE DAY,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.291
HE TAKES ONE OF THOSE
HERBAL DIET PILLS,

13:11.291 --> 13:15.228
HIS STUPID HEART EXPLODES,
AND I GET A "D."

13:17.998 --> 13:21.434
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GONNA
BE EASY FOR YOU,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.603
BUT THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLE
YOU'LL BE SETTING FOR MAX.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.672
HMM. THEY HAVE
A BUSINESS DEGREE. THAT'S GOOD.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.174
WHAT'S THAT?

13:27.174 --> 13:30.777
A COLLEGE APPLICATION.
GEORGE IS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

13:30.777 --> 13:34.314
WHY?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.782
DO THEY NEED
A BIGHEADED MASCOT

13:35.782 --> 13:37.951
TO RUN AROUND
AT THE FOOTBALL GAMES?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.889
NO, IF THEY NEEDED A MASCOT,

13:41.889 --> 13:43.924
THEY COULD JUST
PUT A SADDLE ON YOU

13:43.924 --> 13:46.259
AND RIDE YOU AROUND
AT THE TOUCHDOWNS.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.262
BENNY, THIS IS SERIOUS.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.932
GEORGE IS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING HIS BUSINESS DEGREE.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.167
ANGIE, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
SHE DON'T CARE.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.871
GEORGE, YOU'RE NOT
COLLEGE MATERIAL.

13:57.871 --> 14:01.341
YOU WERE LUCKY
TO GET THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.044
YOU SEE, MIJO,
THE WORLD IS DIVIDED UP

14:04.044 --> 14:06.413
INTO TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.551
I-I WOULD GO ON,
BUT I BET I ALREADY LOST YOU

14:11.551 --> 14:12.920
BECAUSE OF THE MATH.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.688
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ME,

14:15.688 --> 14:16.957
AND I'M-A GO
BACK TO SCHOOL

14:16.957 --> 14:18.658
SO I CAN SET AN EXAMPLE
FOR MY SON.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.528
I'M-A DO ALL THE STUFF
COLLEGE KIDS DO--

14:21.528 --> 14:23.763
PROTEST STUFF I DON'T
UNDERSTAND, PULL ALL-NIGHTERS.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.233
I'M GONNA GO TO FLORIDA FOR
SPRING BREAK AND TAKE MY TOP OFF

14:26.233 --> 14:30.070
BECAUSE Â¿SABÃ©S QUE?
THIS COED HAS GONE WILD.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.579
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.048
CARMEN'S FILLING OUT
HER APPLICATION

14:41.048 --> 14:42.983
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.619
I WAS ABOUT TO DO THE SAME
FOR VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.588
PRETTY WILD, HUH, CARMEN?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.423
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO COLLEGE
AT THE SAME TIME?

14:50.423 --> 14:53.060
IF I GET IN, DAD.
THIS APPLICATION IS CRAZY.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.028
THEY WANT MY TRANSCRIPTS,
TEST SCORES.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.663
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE BIG THING.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.400
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH, BUT WE'LL
GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.974
"PLEASE DESCRIBE IN DETAIL
THE PERSONAL BENEFITS

15:06.974 --> 15:08.808
"YOU DERIVE FROM
YOUR VOLUNTEER WORK

15:08.808 --> 15:10.610
"AND/OR COMMUNITY SERVICE."

15:10.610 --> 15:15.682
"HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
CONVICTED OF A FELONY?"

15:15.682 --> 15:17.717
I'M GONNA PUT DOWN "NO."

15:17.717 --> 15:22.922
"LIST THE CHRONOLOGY OF ALL YOUR
COLLEGE PREPARATORY ELECTIVES."

15:22.922 --> 15:26.559
"HAVE YOU TAKEN
AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE..."

15:26.559 --> 15:28.361
(continues indistinctly)

15:35.135 --> 15:39.006
OKAY. SIGN IT, DATE IT
AND FAX IT.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.640
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M IN!

15:40.640 --> 15:43.243
CLASSES HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
AND I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.313
DAD, YOU HAD ONE PAGE
TO FILL OUT.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.415
LOOK, CARMEN, I KNOW WE'RE
GOING TO COMPETING SCHOOLS,

15:48.415 --> 15:51.051
BUT LET'S NOT BRING THE RIVALRY
INTO THE HOUSE.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.757
SO, MAX, YOUR FATHER'S
REALLY DOING IT.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.426
HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.660
NO WAY.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.463
I ALREADY FILLED OUT
MY APPLICATION. CHECK IT OUT.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.798
YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAID
THAT STUFF AT THE ASSEMBLY

16:05.798 --> 16:07.734
ABOUT HOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO COLLEGE,

16:07.734 --> 16:10.937
I WAS JUST COVERING FOR THE FACT
THAT I NEVER WENT, OKAY?

16:10.937 --> 16:14.874
I WAS OVER-CONSUMMATING.

16:14.874 --> 16:18.011
"OVER-CONSUMMATING"?

16:18.011 --> 16:21.414
ANGIE, I'M SORRY, BUT COLLEGE
STUDENTS USE BIG WORDS, OKAY?

16:21.414 --> 16:24.951
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL
INFERIORATED, OKAY?

16:24.951 --> 16:30.023
MAN, I-I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.525
MAX, YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH YOUR DAD.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.127
IF HE GOES, YOU GO.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.163
YOU BETTER GET UPSTAIRS
AND STUDY.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.699
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.202
DO YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,

16:42.202 --> 16:45.638
YOU'LL BE IN YOUR FIRST
COLLEGE CLASS?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.774
LOOK, ANGIE, WHAT IF
I'M WAY IN OVER MY HEAD

16:47.774 --> 16:49.709
AND I CAN'T DO THE WORK?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.844
WELL, I'M SURE
THE TEACHER WILL HELP YOU

16:51.844 --> 16:53.413
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.048
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT I'M-A DO THIS TIME.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.617
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I WAS AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS

16:57.617 --> 17:00.220
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO LOOK DUMB, SO I JUST GOT BY

17:00.220 --> 17:02.089
BY MAKIN' PEOPLE LAUGH,
YOU KNOW,

17:02.089 --> 17:06.025
TURNIN' MY EYELIDS INSIDE OUT,
SHOVIN' PENCILS UP MY NOSE.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.694
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:07.694 --> 17:12.599
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE ACTING
LIKE THAT ON OUR HONEYMOON?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.069
YOU HAD QUESTIONS AND YOU WERE
AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP?

17:16.069 --> 17:18.638
I DIDN'T NEED HELP.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.773
I MADE A CHEAT SHEET,
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

17:20.773 --> 17:23.076
THAT THE LIGHTS
WERE GONNA BE ALL THE WAY OUT.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.121
(students speaking indistinctly)

17:36.523 --> 17:38.057
HOW YOU DOIN'?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.827
GEORGE LOPEZ,
CLASS OF '07.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.830
COULD YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
WITH MY CAMERA FOR ME?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.732
I WANT MY SON TO SEE ME
ON MY FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.999
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.670
I WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT
LEARNING IS FUN. WAIT A MINUTE.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.276
WELCOME TO MICRO-ECONOMICS.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.611
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS,
EVERYONE.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.648
MY NAME IS
PROFESSOR TRACY LIM.

18:01.648 --> 18:05.852
I WILL BE YOUR INSTRUCTOR
FOR THIS CLASS.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.456
WE'LL START WITH A BRIEF
OVERVIEW OF ECONOMIC THEORY.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.858
(speaking indistinctly)
SHH!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.293
COME ON, GUYS, HEY,

18:13.293 --> 18:15.528
IF THIS IS WORKING,
THEN THESE AREN'T, OKAY?

18:15.528 --> 18:18.865
I EXPECT MORE FROM ONE OF
MY OWN, Â¿SABÃ©S QUE, VATO?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.099
SAD, HEY, VERY SAD.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.401
TAKE IT AWAY, PROFESSOR.

18:21.401 --> 18:27.374
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE, TOO.
I SEEN YOUR FACES.

18:27.374 --> 18:31.611
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,
WE'LL BE STUDYING A BRANCH

18:31.611 --> 18:34.647
OF ECONOMIC THEORY
THAT DELVES INTO THE BEHAVIOR

18:34.647 --> 18:36.683
OF INDIVIDUAL ECONOMIC AGENTS

18:36.683 --> 18:39.552
AND THEIR RAMIFICATIONS
ON THE GLOBALIZED MARKET.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.821
YES?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.857
I GOT A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.593
OH, AND WHICH PART WAS THAT?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.195
EVERYTHING AFTER
"IN LAYMAN'S TERMS."

18:48.195 --> 18:52.865
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I DO IT ALL THE TIME...

18:52.865 --> 18:56.303
I SEE WE HAVE OUR FUNNYMAN.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.670
OH, IT'S OKAY.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.472
YOU KNOW, I LIKE COMEDY, TOO.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.742
UM, OH, THIS IS ONE OF
MY FAVORITES. KNOCK, KNOCK.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.613
OKAY. WHO'S THERE?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.649
BE QUIET.
YOU'RE WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME.

19:09.649 --> 19:15.788
"BE QUIET, YOU'RE WASTING
EVERYONE'S TIME" WHO?

19:19.826 --> 19:24.831
JUST TO SEE WHERE WE STAND,
WHO HERE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE

19:24.831 --> 19:29.769
BETWEEN INFLATION, RECESSION,
DEFLATION, DEPRESSION?

19:29.769 --> 19:33.740
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.010
YES? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

19:38.010 --> 19:41.548
OH, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.
I JUST HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.050
IS IT AN ECONOMICS QUESTION?

19:44.050 --> 19:45.885
YES.
WHAT IS IT?

19:45.885 --> 19:49.722
IS IT TOO LATE FOR ME
TO GET MY $28 BACK?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.168
MR. LOPEZ,

20:02.168 --> 20:03.670
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:03.670 --> 20:06.473
UH, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.075
I SAW YOU PASSING A NOTE.
ARE YOU CHEATING?

20:09.075 --> 20:11.344
NO, I'M NOT, I SWEAR.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.046
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE THE NOTE

20:14.046 --> 20:15.615
WITH THE WHOLE CLASS?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.585
DON'T WANT TO.
READ IT.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.023
"DO YOU THINK
PROFESSOR LIM IS HOT?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.792
"CIRCLE 'YES' OR 'NO'."

20:30.630 --> 20:34.634
SOMEBODY PASSED IT TO ME.
I-I JUST MADE A CIRCLE.

20:34.634 --> 20:39.238
YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE RESPECTED
YOU MORE IF YOU WERE CHEATING.

20:41.474 --> 20:52.652
OKAY, Â¿SABÃ©S QUE? I'M-A CHANGE
MY ANSWER TO "NO."
