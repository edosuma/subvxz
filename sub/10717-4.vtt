00:01.000 --> 00:03.321
(engine revs)
(tires screech)

00:07.040 --> 00:08.632
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.706
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.010 --> 00:16.400
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.476
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:20.520 --> 00:21.646
Who are you, Clark?

00:21.680 --> 00:22.988
I'm your husband...

00:23.020 --> 00:26.478
Who loves you more
than you will ever know.

00:26.520 --> 00:31.150
STAN: You know, I think we
should keep an eye on Martha.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.327
I won't do it, Stan.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.520
Fine.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.397
But I'll _take her
to dInner.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.662
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.497
Pastor Tim.
I told him.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.666
I'm so sorry.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.200
What was I
supposed to do?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.901
You were supposed
to put this family first!

00:45.940 --> 00:47.339
That is what you are
supposed to do!

00:47.380 --> 00:49.029
You could leave on Friday,

00:49.080 --> 00:50.672
come back Sunday night.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.348
While you're away,

00:52.380 --> 00:55.213
the Pastor and his wife
will have an accident.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.683
HENRY: Hey, Paige.
Guess what?

00:56.720 --> 00:59.188
We're going to Epcot.
What?

00:59.220 --> 01:01.017
She'll think about this,
and she will figure it out.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.528
Maybe not right now,
but she will know.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.528
They've given us a way
out of this

01:05.560 --> 01:06.959
that |ets_us
keep our lives.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.276
(coughing)
Gabriel?

01:22.310 --> 01:23.538
What happened?
-Get out.

01:23.580 --> 01:24.604
What happened?!

01:24.650 --> 01:26.242
You should've
wrapped Gabriel

01:26.280 --> 01:28.316
in plastic
and burned his body.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.319
(telephone line ringing)

01:44.930 --> 01:45.897
WOMAN: Hello?

01:45.930 --> 01:47.261
This is Mrs. Banks.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.892
My husband and I
need to postpone

01:48.940 --> 01:50.601
the deliveries
for this weekend.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.234
We can't be where we need
to be for them.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.736
It can't happen.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.099
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.606
Do you know when you'd like
to reschedule?

01:57.650 --> 01:58.969
No.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.288
There were two deliveries.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.815
We really --
we -- we can't have

02:05.850 --> 02:07.909
those deliveries take place,
all right?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.450
Yes. I understand.

02:11.630 --> 02:14.121
I think you'd have a better view
if you went over there.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.311
(telephone rings)

02:43.830 --> 02:44.683
Hello?

02:44.730 --> 02:46.197
Paige.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.629
Mom, where are you?
What's going on?

02:47.660 --> 02:50.959
Dad and I have to work.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.297
We'll be home Saturday.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.161
Why? Oh, God.
Did something happen?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.508
No. No, no, no, no,
nothing happened.

02:56.540 --> 02:57.802
Listen to me.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.479
Is this because of me?
No, Page --

03:00.510 --> 03:02.978
Pastor Tim and Alice --
did they say something?

03:03.010 --> 03:04.807
(voice breaking)
I...I'm so sorry, Mom.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.477
I didn't mean to.
Please, I --

03:06.520 --> 03:08.169
Paige, Paige, stop.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.687
Listen to me.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.985
Dad and I
just have to work.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.817
You take care
of Henry, okay?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.680
Okay, Mom.

03:18.530 --> 03:20.157
Everything's fine.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.328
(crying)

03:23.370 --> 03:24.997
Paige, did you hear me?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.395
(inhales shakily)

03:26.440 --> 03:29.830
Yeah. I heard you, Mom.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.406
We're gonna
be home soon.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.903
(sniffles)

03:38.950 --> 03:41.373
(sobs)

03:53.930 --> 03:55.557
(wire snaps)

04:57.290 --> 04:58.928
(door opens)

04:58.960 --> 05:00.291
(door closes)

05:03.800 --> 05:05.995
I told the Centre to cancel
the Epcot plan.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.789
How is he?

05:10.970 --> 05:12.471
Great.
Never better.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.273
What can we do?

05:14.310 --> 05:16.449
Mnh.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.449
If we believed in God,
I'd say pray.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.947
You think this is funny?

05:20.980 --> 05:24.780
He's not a young man,
not in the best shape,

05:24.820 --> 05:27.812
infected with
a deadly pathogen.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.784
He ought to be in a hospital,
hooked up to an I.V.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.298
we all should.

05:33.330 --> 05:35.651
I think it's hilarious.

05:36.830 --> 05:41.494
Look -_- we need to_ be
as sanitary as p055lble.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.509
Avoid touching your nose,
eyes, mouth.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.509
Wash your hands 30 seconds
longer than you normally do.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.475
If you have to touch each other,
put on gloves.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.978
Dispose of used gloves
and paper towels

05:53.020 --> 05:54.339
in a medical waste bag.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.340
(breathing rapidly)

06:01.890 --> 06:03.482
W-what happened with Paige?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.827
She thinks we're in trouble

06:04.860 --> 06:06.555
because Pastor Tim
told somebody.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.989
I told her we're fine,
that we'll be back,

06:09.030 --> 06:11.328
but she doesn't believe me.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.259
We'll straighten her out
when we get back.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.071
(indistinct conversations)

07:49.330 --> 07:51.127
(sighs)

08:15.660 --> 08:17.821
(sighs heavily)

08:25.670 --> 08:27.137
Oh.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.967
HENRY: Do you have any milk?
We ran out.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.160
Uh, yeah.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.462
Uh, sure.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.306
Hey, do you know anything
about computers?

08:33.340 --> 08:34.807
(door closes)

08:34.840 --> 08:36.979
Um, not really.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.501
I mean, I have one at work,
but, uh...

08:39.550 --> 08:40.972
No.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.478
Well, I kind of need, like,
a computer expert.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.818
Well, you know, Matthew's gonna
be back here a few days a week.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.488
Really?
Yeah. He knows a lot.
He'll show you.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.681
Good, 'cause my teacher
doesn't know shit.

08:52.530 --> 08:53.827
_Is this
your scnence teacher?

08:53.860 --> 08:54.724
Math.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.829
Oh.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.827
What does she look like?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.019
It's a guy.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.664
(chuckling)
Okay.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.531
Can I ask you something?

09:04.070 --> 09:05.560
I don't know, Henry.

09:05.610 --> 09:08.170
You say that, and I --
I get a little nervous.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.178
No, it's not...

09:10.210 --> 09:12.201
Like, when you first met
Mrs. Beeman...

09:12.250 --> 09:13.342
Mm-hmm.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.075
...what did you say,
exactly?

09:17.220 --> 09:19.916
Well,
that was a-a long time ago.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.679
Like,
when you were kids or...

09:22.730 --> 09:24.027
No, but, uh, college.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.187
It was at a party,
actually.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.891
I was with some friends,

09:27.930 --> 09:30.364
and I turned around and someone
smashed Into my drink.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.368
And it splattered
all over me,

09:32.400 --> 09:34.038
and I'm -- you know, I'm all
dressed up and everything,

09:34.070 --> 09:36.038
and I was so pissed off.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.209
And I looked up,
and it was Sandra.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.538
And I'd never
seen her before,

09:40.580 --> 09:45.370
butshe".
just started...laughing.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.718
(laughs)

09:46.750 --> 09:49.275
She just c-couldn't
stop laughing.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.878
And then what happened?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.615
(chuckles)

09:52.660 --> 09:56.756
Uh, we got married and had
Matthew and got divorced.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.888
Hey, do you ever talk
to your dad about this stuff,

10:03.930 --> 10:05.568
this girl stuff?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.739
No.
Why not?

10:07.770 --> 10:10.967
Well, he's not really around.
He's always traveling.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.778
Like, we were supposed to go
to Epcot tonight,

10:13.810 --> 10:16.574
but...they went
away instead.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.770
Hm, where'd they go?

10:17.810 --> 10:20.745
I don't know.
Paige told me, but I forgot.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.077
Maybe New York?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.179
I think it's some kind of
business trip.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.087
(door opens)

10:27.120 --> 10:28.758
Henry,
you're gonna miss the bus!

10:28.790 --> 10:29.984
(door closes)
STAN: Not Henry.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.759
He's in the car.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.099
He found Matthew's Cocoa Puffs,
so he's eaten already.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.098
I'm -- I'm gonna give him a lift
to school.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.428
Uh, you don't have to drive him
to school, Mr. Beeman.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.767
Oh, it's no problem.
You want a ride, too?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.597
No. I'll --
I'll catch the bus.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.800
Okay.

10:48.340 --> 10:52.276
So, your parents had to go away
last minute, huh?

10:52.310 --> 10:55.609
Yeah, they, uh --
A client in New York,

10:55.650 --> 10:58.778
a really big client,
was threatening to fire them,

10:58.820 --> 11:02.950
so they had to go and --
and fix it.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.629
Oh, that's a bummer
about Epcot, though.

11:05.660 --> 11:09.323
Yeah, but I guess we'll --
we'll go again sometime.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.662
We went to Disneyland once.
It was fun.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.675
Well, I-I got to get ready
to get the bus.

11:20.710 --> 11:23.008
Okay. See you later.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.541
(door opens, closes)

11:47.370 --> 11:49.691
What does EST say
about death?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.548
I don't, um --
I don't know.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.242
It never came up.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.520
Gabriel said that our people
were with my mother

12:11.560 --> 12:13.255
when she died,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.552
that she wanted me
to know that she loved me.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.602
Paige knows we love her,
right?

12:27.940 --> 12:29.237
Of course she does.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.640
We really have no choice
with Pastor Tim.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.933
(indistinct conversations)

12:55.970 --> 12:57.904
Hi, Martha.
Hello, Agent Aderholt.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.079
How are you?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.738
Um, I'm fine.
Thanks. You?

13:02.780 --> 13:04.407
I'm 50-50, to be honest.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.270
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.839
Gene -- I never would have
suspected hIm.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.179
Me neither.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.325
I, um -- I have a lot of work
to do, so...

13:18.360 --> 13:20.248
Oh. Yeah, sure, sure.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.927
Working late tonight?

13:21.960 --> 13:24.622
Uh, nope.
Just going home.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.594
TV, wine, and bed.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.631
I don't mean_
to take up your tIme.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.468
It's just, I always enjoy
talking to you, Martha.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.473
I enjoy talking to you, as well,
Agent Aderholt.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.977
Well, how about
we grab that meal

13:39.010 --> 13:41.319
we've always been promising
to get together?

13:41.350 --> 13:44.615
My -- my dinner plans just
fell through, so I'm free.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.618
Tonight?
Yeah.

13:46.650 --> 13:51.952
Now, I'm not as entertaining
as TV, but there will be wine.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.823
Um...

13:54.860 --> 13:55.952
Sure.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.126
Sure.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.468
Great. _
I'll make a reservation.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.797
Really looking forward

14:00.840 --> 14:02.637
to talking to you
outside of this place.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.661
(chuckles)
Me too.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.487
PHILIP: You okay?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.724
Ijust -- I'm not hungry.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.055
Henry had his
biology test today.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.523
You helped him study,
right?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.993
I thought you were.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.361
I told you I couldn't.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.867
He probably
didn't study at all.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.502
Maybe Paige helped him.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.531
With all she has going on?
There's no way she --

14:40.580 --> 14:43.777
You (scoffs) you're worried
about your kid's biology test?

14:44.780 --> 14:48.011
What do I know?
I never had kids,
but you got to eat.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.540
She's not hungry.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.389
Not hungry
or you have no appetite?

14:54.220 --> 14:56.211
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.251
Are you nauseous?

14:58.290 --> 14:59.552
A little, I think.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.249
You look flushed.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.369
You think
she's getting sick?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.367
Are you dizzy?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.527
No.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.561
Have your bowel movements
been normal?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.431
Yeah.
No diarrhea?

15:10.470 --> 15:13.268
No. I mean -- well,
I-I haven't gone yet.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.198
Your pulse is
a little high,

15:15.240 --> 15:18.539
but that could be a reaction
to the antibiotic.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.945
Well, how come
we don't feel sick?

15:19.980 --> 15:22.540
Everybody reacts to
antibiotics differently.

15:22.580 --> 15:23.410
Look up.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.747
(penlight clicks)

15:24.790 --> 15:26.417
Any pain?

15:26.450 --> 15:27.883
So, it could be
the antibiotics,

15:27.920 --> 15:29.114
or she could
be getting it?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.422
(penlight clicks)

15:34.930 --> 15:36.921
(telephone line ringing)

15:38.770 --> 15:40.431
PHILIP: After the beep,
please leave your name,

15:40.470 --> 15:42.267
a brief message, and a number
where I can reach you,

15:42.300 --> 15:43.938
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

15:43.970 --> 15:45.904
(beep)

15:45.940 --> 15:47.407
Um, it's me again.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.908
I'm s-- I'm sorry to leave you
so many messages.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.079
Um, it's just, something
happened at work,

15:52.110 --> 15:54.613
and it's important, um...

16:00.120 --> 16:04.955
Actually, uh, it's probably
not a big deal.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.255
I don't -- I don't need to go
into detail

16:08.300 --> 16:09.597
on your phone message.

16:09.630 --> 16:13.134
Um, it's just that it's, uh...

16:15.000 --> 16:20.279
I need to hear from you
within the hour because, um...

16:20.310 --> 16:23.438
I'm going to dinner with, um,
someone from work,

16:23.480 --> 16:28.474
with a male colleague
from work, and, um...

16:28.520 --> 16:31.114
It would be really helpful
ifI could...

16:31.150 --> 16:33.789
discuss a few things
with you beforehand.

16:33.820 --> 16:34.980
(sighs)

16:36.660 --> 16:38.787
I'll be here for another hour,
and then I'm leaving.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.459
Unless you call me and t-tell me
otherwise, I'm leaving.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.162
So, um...

16:47.170 --> 16:49.661
Call me back...

16:49.700 --> 16:51.668
Before then, right away.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.875
I love you.
(beep)

17:11.690 --> 17:15.148
(retching)

17:15.200 --> 17:17.361
(gasping lightly)

17:27.540 --> 17:29.735
(toilet flushes)

17:34.380 --> 17:36.848
It -- it still might be
the antibiotic.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.211
We don't know yet.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.779
(water runs)

17:44.390 --> 17:45.584
(breathing heavily)

17:45.630 --> 17:47.120
(water shuts off)

17:50.060 --> 17:51.220
If something happens --

17:51.270 --> 17:52.396
Elizabeth.

17:52.430 --> 17:53.260
Philip.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.188
I-It's not gonna happen.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.639
Please listen.

17:59.970 --> 18:02.609
If something happens...

18:02.640 --> 18:05.973
you blame me for Pastor Tim
and Alice.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.445
Don't wait for Paige
to get suspicious.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.789
I'm not doing that.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.789
Then you can just
raise them here...

18:14.820 --> 18:16.754
be Americans.

18:19.130 --> 18:23.396
Henry doesn't even ever have
to know, and Paige...

18:23.430 --> 18:24.260
Elizabeth.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.791
I'm just saying if.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.770
It's what you want,
what you've always wanted.

18:36.810 --> 18:38.141
(water running)

18:56.300 --> 18:57.790
(Dorothy Moore's "Misty Blue"
plays)

18:57.830 --> 19:00.469
ADERHOLT:
For me, it's the parties.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.266
I-I've always been a loner,
so I don't mind going home,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.460
making some dinner,
doing some work.

19:06.510 --> 19:09.308
But standing at a party
with a drink in my hand

19:09.340 --> 19:12.104
while everyone tries to
introduce me (chuckles)

19:12.150 --> 19:13.617
it's the worst,
am I right?

19:13.650 --> 19:16.813
* Oh, it's

19:16.850 --> 19:22.356
* Been such a long, long time

19:23.490 --> 19:27.494
* Looked like I'd get you
off of my mind *

19:28.530 --> 19:30.327
* But I can't

19:30.370 --> 19:32.122
I'm sorry. Um, I'm sorry.
What did you say?

19:32.170 --> 19:33.797
* Just the thought of you

19:33.840 --> 19:35.296
* Just the thought of you *

19:35.340 --> 19:36.193
Nothing.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.638
* Turns my whole world
misty blue *

19:41.680 --> 19:44.171
* Misty blue *
(camera shutter clicking)

19:46.010 --> 19:49.013
* Ohh

19:50.350 --> 19:52.818
* Just the mention
of your name *

19:52.850 --> 19:55.512
* Just your name *

19:55.560 --> 20:00.350
* Turns the flicker to a flame

20:01.430 --> 20:04.194
* Listen to me good, baby

20:05.870 --> 20:10.534
* I think of the things
we used to do *

20:11.870 --> 20:15.829
* And my whole world...
Um, you asked me
if I was seeing anybody.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.508
Y-Yes, but you don't have
to answer me.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.676
Y-You really don't.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.541
No. It's okay. Um,

20:21.580 --> 20:23.582
I am seeing someone.

20:23.620 --> 20:25.679
Um...he's married.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.018
* I should forget you

20:28.060 --> 20:29.254
Oh.

20:29.290 --> 20:32.054
* Heaven knows I try

20:33.600 --> 20:34.726
Mm.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.523
*Ohh*

20:36.560 --> 20:37.766
* Baby

20:39.070 --> 20:42.938
* When I say that I'm glad
we're through *

20:45.410 --> 20:50.575
* Deep in my heart,
I know I've lied *

20:50.610 --> 20:53.078
* I've lied

20:53.110 --> 20:55.214
* I've lied

20:55.250 --> 20:56.547
I'm not embarrassed.

20:56.580 --> 20:57.911
* Ooh

20:57.950 --> 20:59.713
I'm not ashamed.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.615
It's just...

21:02.760 --> 21:03.920
I don't think
it's something

21:03.960 --> 21:06.053
most people
would understand.

21:06.090 --> 21:10.049
They say, "You're a fool
for seeing a married man.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.898
He must be
some kind of sleaze."

21:12.930 --> 21:14.431
But it's not that way --

21:14.470 --> 21:17.268
* It's been _
such a long, long time *
At all.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.266
It's s-simple.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.436
Simple?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.573
* Looks like I'd get you...

21:22.610 --> 21:26.899
Well, there are no
false promises or lies,

21:26.950 --> 21:29.919
no unrealistic
expectations.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.087
* Just the thought of you *

21:31.120 --> 21:32.439
He's not gonna leave
his wife.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.589
I'm not waiting
for him to.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.929
* My whole world
turns misty blue *

21:37.960 --> 21:42.920
But we provide each other
with comfort, companionship.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.793
* Ahh, ahh, ahh

21:45.830 --> 21:47.127
* Oh, I can't, I can't

21:47.170 --> 21:48.797
And the sneaking around

21:48.840 --> 21:50.091
doesn't bother you?

21:50.140 --> 21:52.131
* Forget you
No.

21:52.170 --> 21:53.933
* My whole world
turns misty blue *

21:53.980 --> 21:57.108
I mean, we're discreet,

21:57.140 --> 22:00.439
but I'm not wearing wigs

22:00.480 --> 22:02.277
and sneaking
into motel rooms.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.617
(both chuckle)

22:03.650 --> 22:06.289
It's grown-up.
It's honest.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.117
* My whole world turns

22:08.160 --> 22:11.948
It's probably the most
honest relationship

22:11.990 --> 22:13.992
that I've ever had.

22:16.330 --> 22:19.322
* Oooh-ooh-ooh

23:10.590 --> 23:12.114
(coughs)

23:32.410 --> 23:33.809
(sniffles)

24:22.120 --> 24:24.281
(breathing heavily)

24:38.140 --> 24:41.109
(moans lightly)

24:41.140 --> 24:43.301
(exhales sharply)

24:43.340 --> 24:44.773
Where are you going?

24:44.810 --> 24:46.778
I have to call Paige.

24:46.810 --> 24:48.277
No.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.788
You called her already.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.448
Move so I can talk to her --
No, no, no, you can't.
You can't.

24:53.490 --> 24:56.311
It's late.
You'll scare her to death.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.952
Come on.
Unh...

24:57.990 --> 25:00.823
Lie down. It's okay.
We'll take care of it tomorrow.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.661
Come on.
You need to sleep.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.545
(sighs)

26:58.680 --> 27:00.443
(sighs)

28:26.870 --> 28:28.189
WILLIAM:
Her fever's broken.

28:29.270 --> 28:31.500
So, she's better?

28:31.540 --> 28:34.202
(sighs)
I don't know.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.848
(sighs)

28:37.880 --> 28:41.372
Sorry
I...I can't be more...

28:43.250 --> 28:44.547
(sighs)

28:48.390 --> 28:50.278
How long have you two
been together?

28:51.590 --> 28:53.387
Um, over 20 years.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.924
Long time.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.427
Yeah.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.859
How many kids?

28:58.900 --> 29:00.936
Two.

29:00.970 --> 29:04.701
That's nice,
what you have.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.469
Everything okay
with the kids?

29:08.240 --> 29:10.708
I saw her face
when she called home.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.549
(car alarm blares in distance)

29:12.580 --> 29:14.810
Things are hard right now.

29:18.990 --> 29:22.084
(sighs)
You're still luclq.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.251
You don't know.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.898
You don't know what it's like
to do this job

29:33.940 --> 29:36.898
and not have anybody
to talk to about it,

29:36.940 --> 29:40.603
except a series of handlers
who don't give a shit.

29:40.640 --> 29:45.907
My daughter is in a very bad
place because of us...

29:45.950 --> 29:46.939
because of this job.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.908
She could sense
that something was off.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.283
You know, the late hours,
no family ever around.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.264
Elizabeth wanted to tell her
who we were,

30:06.300 --> 30:08.291
and I didn't.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.801
We fought about it
for months.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.629
And then we did.

30:18.310 --> 30:21.108
Nobody sane
would do this work.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.618
(both chuckle lightly)

30:23.650 --> 30:25.641
She would.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.854
You?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.457
I'd be normal.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.799
(scoffing) Normal.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.821
W-With Elizabeth, though?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.536
(exhales weakly)

30:49.680 --> 30:51.807
(coughing)

30:51.850 --> 30:53.169
(moans)

30:54.220 --> 30:56.142
Here.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.011
Here.
Take this.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.049
How do you feel?

31:05.090 --> 31:06.523
Better.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.350
(moans)

31:12.370 --> 31:13.268
I'm okay.

31:28.380 --> 31:30.177
Ohh.
Yeah.

31:30.220 --> 31:34.179
You have photophobia.
It'll go away soon.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.757
(clears throat)
I'll give you another shot
of the antibiotic

31:36.790 --> 31:40.419
in, uh, 2 hours, then another
one 12 hours after that.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.927
Do I have to take it, too?

31:41.960 --> 31:43.928
No. You never had
the disease,

31:43.970 --> 31:47.269
just a bad reaction
to the drug.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.892
Thank you, William.

31:50.470 --> 31:52.404
I was coerced.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.579
No.
It doesn't matter.

31:55.640 --> 31:56.607
Close your eyes.

31:57.910 --> 32:00.606
Open your mouth.
(coughs)

32:00.650 --> 32:03.710
The kids will be home.
Yeah.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.980
Henry will be mad he missed
his weekend at Epcot.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.886
Tim and Alice.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.889
We'll go to Epcot
next weekend,

32:12.930 --> 32:15.125
keep close tabs on them
until then.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.795
No, Philip...

32:20.130 --> 32:21.062
...you were right.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.590
We -- we can't do it.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.733
We can't kill them.

32:24.770 --> 32:27.261
Paige --

32:27.310 --> 32:28.231
she'd never get over it.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.407
You want to run?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.579
We can't run.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.248
So...

32:34.280 --> 32:35.747
We work Tim and Alice.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.089
We talk to them.
(sighs)

32:38.120 --> 32:39.417
It's one more thing.

32:39.450 --> 32:40.917
(sighs)

32:40.950 --> 32:42.781
It's a hell of a thing.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.424
It is.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.451
(footsteps approaching)

32:47.960 --> 32:50.758
He's not
contagious anymore.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.267
Is he gonna be all right?

32:52.300 --> 32:54.598
Well, his fever's gone down,
and he's drinking water,

32:54.640 --> 32:56.267
but he's gonna need some
treatment for a while.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.790
I'll stay here
until he gets stronger,

32:57.840 --> 33:01.936
but you should stop using
this place after that.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.608
Keep paying rent
so nobody else can use it.

33:04.650 --> 33:09.770
We may have killed everything
with the bleach, but, uh...

33:09.820 --> 33:11.640
Ah, I'm gonna
make some tea.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.550
(water running)

33:20.830 --> 33:23.651
(water shuts off)

33:23.700 --> 33:25.998
(coughs)

33:30.870 --> 33:33.134
You've been
talking about me.

33:33.170 --> 33:34.478
Asking about you.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.671
Mm.
And what's the prognosis?

33:36.710 --> 33:38.348
It's good.

33:50.690 --> 33:53.181
We don't want the Centre
to take care of Tim and Alice.

33:55.730 --> 33:59.666
It would destroy Paige if
something happened to them.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.158
Well, I'll have to get you
out fast, then.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.201
We're not leaving.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.329
We'll make a deeper
connection with them,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.530
make it harder for them to do
anything that would hurt Paige.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.378
You would be living
in a burning house.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.376
What's new?

34:16.420 --> 34:18.285
(exhales sharply)

34:22.390 --> 34:24.051
When I was younger...

34:26.090 --> 34:29.594
I was afraid all the time.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.062
Everyone was afraid
during the war.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.765
It was before the war.

34:39.770 --> 34:42.568
We were killing each other
every day.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.407
(sighs)

34:47.950 --> 34:49.941
I told myself
that I would be safe

34:49.980 --> 34:53.882
if I just did
what I was told...

34:53.920 --> 34:56.559
but none of us was safe.

34:56.590 --> 35:00.253
Every day, I'd think,
"Is it today?

35:00.290 --> 35:04.420
Is it gonna be me?

35:04.470 --> 35:06.290
Is it my turn?"

35:08.600 --> 35:10.761
It's not an easy way
to live.

35:16.010 --> 35:17.978
But it's your choice.

35:18.010 --> 35:20.274
Will the Centre
see it that way?

35:21.780 --> 35:23.509
I'll have to get them there.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.418
Perhaps they'll see
the value in...

35:28.460 --> 35:30.758
Sparing Pastor Tim
and his wife

35:30.790 --> 35:34.954
if they believe their deaths
will make Paige un-recruitable.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.836
(sighs)

35:47.140 --> 35:48.277
(sighs)

35:48.310 --> 35:50.778
Paige? Henry?

35:50.810 --> 35:52.971
Are you okay?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.673
We're fine.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.688
I didn't know who to call
or what to do.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.312
We're sorry, honey.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.628
You can't do that to me again.
I have to --

36:08.660 --> 36:09.991
HENRY: Hey, Mom, dad!

36:12.200 --> 36:14.293
I know. I know, I know.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.989
(electronic gunfire)

36:16.040 --> 36:18.634
Oh, I guess you really
missed us, huh?

36:18.670 --> 36:21.309
I'm about to get
to level four.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.807
How was New York?
It sucked.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.137
Yeah, not going
to Epcot sucked.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.171
When are we gonna go?

36:26.210 --> 36:27.802
We'll check
our schedule.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.317
Next weekend?

36:29.350 --> 36:30.647
We'll see.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.011
Whenever you say that...

36:32.050 --> 36:33.642
Henry, we'll figure it out,
okay?

36:33.690 --> 36:36.511
But it doesn't mean
we can't have fun today.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.488
(laughter)

36:40.530 --> 36:41.724
There's an appeal
for calm

36:41.760 --> 36:43.694
within the Jennings
household...

36:43.730 --> 36:45.721
(vocalizing)

36:45.770 --> 36:47.067
...as a new record...

36:47.100 --> 36:48.692
might be broken.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.709
* Me, myself and I
is all I've ever known *

36:51.740 --> 36:54.868
* I never felt the need
to have a hand to hold *

36:54.910 --> 36:58.175
* In everything I do,
I take complete control *

36:58.210 --> 37:00.849
* That's where I'm coming from

37:00.880 --> 37:03.178
* My luclq number's one

37:03.220 --> 37:04.175
-Whoo!
-Yes!

37:04.220 --> 37:05.187
Yes, Mom!

37:05.220 --> 37:07.347
How do you keep doing that?

37:07.390 --> 37:09.381
That's like
the fifth strike in a row.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.923
Sixth strike.
What can I say?

37:11.960 --> 37:13.188
Okay, dad,
we're getting creamed.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.527
Oh, yeah?

37:14.560 --> 37:16.027
Watch this.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.267
* Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

37:18.300 --> 37:20.768
Did they teach you
to bowl?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.769
(as Natasha Fatale)
Vital part of training.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.937
(both laugh)

37:24.970 --> 37:27.632
(pins crash)

37:38.790 --> 37:40.280
(exhales heavily,
sniffles)

38:37.980 --> 38:39.777
(sniffles)

38:39.810 --> 38:41.277
(exhales sharply)

38:41.310 --> 38:43.141
(both crying, laughing)

39:10.880 --> 39:12.643
(conversations in Russian)

39:12.680 --> 39:14.875
(lock disengages)

41:08.630 --> 41:11.622
(gasping, crying)

41:11.670 --> 41:13.319
(gunshot)

41:48.170 --> 41:50.331
(indistinct talking)

43:10.120 --> 43:12.315
(silenced gunshots)

43:27.600 --> 43:30.489
It's after Labor Day.

43:30.540 --> 43:32.337
Mr. Archer? Mr. Archer.

43:32.370 --> 43:34.679
Boop. Sorry.
Had to take that.

43:34.710 --> 43:36.234
ANNOUNCER: Archer.

43:38.880 --> 43:41.178
