<i>The vice president is scheduled
to preside over a Senate vote today...</i>

01:03.898 --> 01:06.943
<i>...on President Sawyer's
controversial Middle East peace plan.</i>

01:07.110 --> 01:09.279
<i>Then tomorrow,
the vote will go to Congress.</i>

01:09.445 --> 01:11.239
<i>Republicans and Democrats...</i>

01:11.406 --> 01:13.992
<i>...have indicated they will vote
along party lines...</i>

01:14.158 --> 01:16.995
<i>...but some members have indicated
that they may cross over.</i>

01:44.063 --> 01:45.356
Castle, this is Hummingbird.

01:45.523 --> 01:48.026
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.697
Carol. He wants to do the thing.

01:52.864 --> 01:54.616
- Really?
- Really.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.536
Mr. President, it isn't a good idea
to deviate from the flight plan.

01:58.703 --> 01:59.787
Pretty please, Carol?

01:59.954 --> 02:02.248
Leader of the free world
saying "pretty please"?

02:02.415 --> 02:04.292
That ought to count for something.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.964
Captain Johns, we are going to deviate
from Route Omaha.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.217
The president would like
to do the thing.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.720
<i>Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.</i>

02:15.887 --> 02:17.805
<i>Dropping to 30 feet.</i>

02:51.255 --> 02:54.217
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln
was the first U.S. president...

02:54.384 --> 02:57.095
...who was in favour of women
having the vote?

02:57.261 --> 03:00.848
He wrote a paper on suffrage while
he was still in the Illinois legislature.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.100
Yes, I did know that...

03:02.266 --> 03:04.352
...because you tell me
every time we do this.

03:07.939 --> 03:11.526
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are short Foxtrot, one minute out.</i>

03:11.693 --> 03:14.737
<i>- I need a go-no go.
- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground...</i>

03:14.904 --> 03:16.906
<i>...all clear, three inbound.</i>

03:18.616 --> 03:21.119
<i>Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report.</i>

03:21.285 --> 03:23.705
Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground.
You are clear.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.873
Scanning sky south.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.042
Clear.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.961
Clear.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.631
Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.216
<i>You are clear.</i>

03:35.383 --> 03:38.803
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You are... Wait. Hold.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.264
<i>- Castle Ground, we are holding.</i>
- Air Command...

03:41.431 --> 03:43.057
...switch to thermal.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

03:43.224 --> 03:44.267
Switching to thermal.

03:45.977 --> 03:47.979
<i>Confirm Sector 5,
southeast quadrant clear.</i>

03:52.275 --> 03:54.485
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You're clear.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.154
<i>Copy that.</i>

03:57.530 --> 04:00.575
<i>Breaking off for security sweep.
Stand by.</i>

04:10.460 --> 04:11.961
Hummingbird approaching.

04:12.837 --> 04:14.797
<i>Castle Ground, all clear.</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:18.801
Be it ever so humble.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.559
Atten-hut! Escort!

04:28.561 --> 04:30.062
Not a bad way to travel, is it?

04:30.229 --> 04:32.565
Beats Dupont Circle, sir.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.445
What time does my wife get in?

04:37.612 --> 04:41.032
- Eighteen forty-five.
- Wake me if civilisation ends.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.411
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.

04:45.578 --> 04:47.705
Hummingbird, you are released.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.377
Tell me we don't have the best job
in the world.

04:55.421 --> 04:59.801
<i>I believe the number-one source
of violence in our world is poverty.</i>

05:00.301 --> 05:04.472
<i>Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood.
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.</i>

05:04.639 --> 05:07.099
<i>And my best friend Ricky,
he had it worse than us.</i>

05:07.266 --> 05:09.310
<i>One day things got
so desperate for Ricky...</i>

05:09.477 --> 05:11.395
<i>...he made a plan
to rob the corner store.</i>

05:11.562 --> 05:14.232
<i>And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?</i>

05:14.398 --> 05:17.485
<i>She had him over,
cooked him a full meal...</i>

05:17.652 --> 05:20.571
<i>...and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted.</i>

05:20.738 --> 05:23.407
<i>And it was then that I realised
that if you feed a man...</i>

05:23.574 --> 05:25.618
<i>you take away his propensity
for violence.</i>

05:25.785 --> 05:27.411
Come on, we're gonna be late.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.747
Hey, hey, hey.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.708
No, no, no. That's... No, that's not...
That's not...

05:32.875 --> 05:34.669
This is not happening right now.

05:34.836 --> 05:36.546
Clyde, we've had this conversation.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.090
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.594
Will you at least look at me
when I'm talking to you?

05:43.761 --> 05:47.682
Look, man, I like squirrels personally,
but you're getting me in trouble.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.559
Do you see this?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.394
You know what this is?

05:51.978 --> 05:54.105
Hey. We gonna need backup?

05:56.941 --> 05:58.442
We're working. Come on.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.028
- We have any more Robitussin?
- Yes, sir. In the car.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.281
No, I'll get it, it's all right.
Quiet night?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.157
We're under attack by squirrels.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.368
They're organised
and they have the numbers.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.620
Little stinkers trying to get
into the feeder?

06:09.787 --> 06:10.830
- Morning.
- Hey, Roy.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.124
This isn't the most glamorous job
in the world.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.917
Look, I appreciate it very much.

06:15.084 --> 06:19.255
- Yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes.
<i>- As leaders, we have a choice.</i>

06:19.422 --> 06:22.341
<i>We can sit back
and let the same cycle of war...</i>

06:22.508 --> 06:25.595
<i>...continue in the Middle East
or we can do something about it.</i>

06:25.761 --> 06:28.639
<i>You know how much money
we've spent on the war since 2001?</i>

06:28.806 --> 06:32.310
<i>Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...</i>

06:32.476 --> 06:34.729
It's gonna be a busy morning, boys.

06:34.896 --> 06:39.150
<i>...education, food, health care
and infrastructure in the Middle East.</i>

06:39.317 --> 06:42.320
<i>Now, we've begun historic talks
with the republic of Iran's...</i>

06:42.486 --> 06:44.655
<i>...newly elected president, Al-Sharif...</i>

06:44.822 --> 06:48.326
<i>...to build peace throughout his region.
America can't do this alone.</i>

06:48.492 --> 06:51.329
<i>We need the full financial support
of all of our allies.</i>

06:51.495 --> 06:53.581
<i>But what we can do
is take the first step.</i>

06:53.748 --> 06:55.333
<i>Therefore, I'm announcing today...</i>

06:55.499 --> 06:58.502
<i>...that all U.S. troops will be removed
from the Middle East.</i>

06:58.669 --> 07:01.631
<i>Let's not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past.</i>

07:01.797 --> 07:04.592
<i>And Lord knows,
I've made some mistakes myself.</i>

07:04.759 --> 07:07.803
<i>Instead, I ask you
to stand with me today.</i>

07:07.970 --> 07:11.641
<i>Sign this treaty. Let's end
this debilitating pattern of violence...</i>

07:11.807 --> 07:15.394
<i>...and let's show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword.</i>

07:15.561 --> 07:16.604
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:16.771 --> 07:20.399
<i>President Sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech...</i>

07:20.566 --> 07:22.610
<i>- ...earlier today in Geneva.</i>
- Here.

07:22.777 --> 07:25.363
<i>- Let's go live...</i>
- You changed your hair.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.365
Last week.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.283
I'm gonna be late tonight.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.536
I love you very much.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.214
Good morning, sir.

07:47.677 --> 07:50.137
John, what do you think
of the president's proposal?

07:50.304 --> 07:53.015
I don't know. It's good
to have less enemies, I guess.

07:53.182 --> 07:56.060
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?

07:56.227 --> 07:59.063
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way...

07:59.230 --> 08:01.607
- ...why didn't you run against him?
- No, no, no.

08:01.774 --> 08:04.110
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.695
I like my constituents.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.406
I like being a thorn in the side
of the administration.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.866
But I think voters today
want somebody cool.

08:11.075 --> 08:14.078
Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker,
I think you're pretty cool.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.334
He went to bed at 8 and watched...

08:20.501 --> 08:23.504
The president has a call scheduled
with the speaker at 9:30.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.840
- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?
- No.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.509
You have to be here
in case of a deadlock...

08:28.676 --> 08:30.094
Hey, I'm gonna see you later.

08:30.261 --> 08:31.929
...With the red tie for that.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.931
- Jenna?
- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.350
Red tie's the way to go.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.854
Jenna. Jenna. Did you get me in?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.398
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?

08:42.565 --> 08:43.649
Dinner. Candlelight.

08:43.816 --> 08:47.278
And a promise that you will try
to get to second base.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.071
Done.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.949
You're meeting with Carol Finnerty,
deputy special agent...

08:52.116 --> 08:54.535
...in charge of the president's
Secret Service.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.746
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.373
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.125
- John...
- You don't understand.

09:01.292 --> 09:05.004
She's a freak for this kind of stuff,
so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.923
I will owe you so much more
than just candlelight dinner.

09:09.008 --> 09:12.136
- I'll make a call.
- Perfect. Thank you. You're the best.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.835
<i>...a truly historic handshake.</i>

09:45.002 --> 09:48.631
<i>What President Sawyer is proposing
to Iranian president Al-Sharif...</i>

09:48.798 --> 09:52.551
<i>...is withdrawing all American troops
across the entire Middle East...</i>

09:52.718 --> 09:55.096
<i>...and for that he'll ask
his G8 partners for help.</i>

09:55.346 --> 09:57.807
<i>It's all about money,
and who won't like this deal...</i>

09:57.973 --> 10:01.185
<i>...are American companies who do
business with the American military.</i>

10:01.435 --> 10:04.355
Wanna grab the door? Em.

10:04.522 --> 10:06.023
I'll get it.

10:08.359 --> 10:09.735
- Hey.
- You're late.

10:09.902 --> 10:13.572
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?

10:14.198 --> 10:17.535
Hey, you, little face.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go, baby.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.541
- Bye, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.459
What's up...?

10:28.337 --> 10:30.756
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?

10:30.923 --> 10:32.633
You missed her talent show.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.719
No, I didn't miss it.
That's, like, next Thursday.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.472
No, it was last Thursday.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.850
It was on the school calendar.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.727
What did she do?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.396
She was a flag twirler.

10:47.606 --> 10:48.899
That's a talent?

10:49.066 --> 10:53.320
She practised for like six weeks, John.
She thought you were gonna be there.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.240
It would've been really nice
to have a bit of a reminder.

10:56.407 --> 11:00.327
- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John.
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.454
Look, I'm just... I'm trying.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.582
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.917
It's a little late for that,
wouldn't you say?

11:11.213 --> 11:12.256
Have a good day.

11:15.885 --> 11:18.012
Are you mad at me?

11:18.179 --> 11:19.346
Just tell me.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.223
Will you be on that all day long?

11:27.730 --> 11:32.610
"Yes." Well, that sucks, because,
you know, I thought you would...

11:32.776 --> 11:34.945
- ...want this, but...
- Lame.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.198
You don't even know what it is.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.410
Do you really think a bribe's
gonna work?

11:41.577 --> 11:43.287
Yeah. I'm hoping so.

11:43.454 --> 11:46.832
- We're both adults here, John.
- Speak for yourself, okay?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.959
Can you please just open it?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.670
- For me?
- What is it?

11:51.837 --> 11:55.341
It's a pony, baby. I don't...
Come on, for me, please just...

12:01.722 --> 12:03.265
These are White House passes.

12:04.016 --> 12:07.186
Yeah. That might mean
we're going to the White House.

12:07.353 --> 12:09.480
And that your dad here
has a job interview...

12:09.647 --> 12:11.232
...with the Secret Service.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.151
This is really cool, John.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.073
- You're just gonna stick with "John"?
- Yeah.

12:21.492 --> 12:24.286
<i>Now The Roger Skinner Show,
today live from the White House.</i>

12:24.453 --> 12:27.081
<i>Hi, folks. President Sawyer
is one of those academics...</i>

12:27.248 --> 12:29.124
<i>...who never served a day in his life...</i>

12:29.291 --> 12:32.378
<i>...and now he wants to tell the military
how to run things?</i>

12:32.544 --> 12:35.923
<i>He's going to make peace with Iran
because he has friends there now?</i>

12:36.674 --> 12:37.758
Come on.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.593
Sir, I have the first lady for you.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.638
Remind me again why we let these guys
broadcast from our lawn.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.515
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?

12:44.682 --> 12:46.350
I knew it was something.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.395
Hey, babe.
How are the French taking it?

12:49.561 --> 12:52.356
The treaty's gonna be
a tough sell here.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.692
- How's it going there?
<i>- Raphelson is the key.</i>

12:54.858 --> 12:58.028
We lose him, then we lose
that Southern voting bloc.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.948
If this goes down, you're looking
at a one-term president.

13:01.115 --> 13:03.867
I know two people who wouldn't
have a problem with that.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.869
<i>Do you still have that watch
I gave you?</i>

13:06.036 --> 13:08.872
Yes, Miss First Lady.
It's in my pocket next to my heart.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.041
You know, Mary Todd
gave it to Lincoln...

13:11.208 --> 13:14.044
...to remind him he only had
so much time to do good things...

13:14.211 --> 13:16.547
...while he was in that chair.
<i>- I hear you.</i>

13:16.714 --> 13:19.216
Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?

13:19.383 --> 13:20.884
<i>I love you ladies. Miss you.</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:24.847
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.

13:27.057 --> 13:31.228
Did you know that 1.5 million people
visit the White House every year?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.981
No, I did not know that.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.399
Look, I'm sorry.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.610
I'm sorry that I didn't make it
to your talent show.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.529
I'm not.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.407
Seriously.

13:43.574 --> 13:47.328
Did you know the White House used
to be called the Presidential Palace?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.914
Look, I need you to hear me right now.
Look at me.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.208
I really wished I was there.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.754
No, you don't.

13:56.920 --> 14:01.216
All I... All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.927
You know that you don't
have to do that with me, right?

14:04.094 --> 14:07.139
- What?
- Have thick skin. You're 11.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.605
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.774
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. Yourself?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.942
- Good.
- Photo IDs, please.

14:20.069 --> 14:21.779
Thank you.

14:23.781 --> 14:26.200
- What are you guys looking for?
- Explosives.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.412
This is awesome.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.748
Park up on the left,
go into the East Lobby.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.625
Have a good one.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.965
Did you know that the president
travels in an 18-ton military-armoured...

14:42.132 --> 14:44.802
...modified Cadillac CTS
built to withstand gas...

14:44.968 --> 14:47.971
...chemical and missile attacks?

14:48.138 --> 14:49.807
- That's on the Internet?
- Wikipedia.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.894
- Capitol Police, off-duty.
- Have to check your weapon.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.312
All right.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.242
Check her good.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.414
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, buddy.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.339
So how is your blog coming along?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.758
Nobody says "blog" anymore, John.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.844
What do you mean,
they don't say "blog"?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.637
- I just learned "blog."
- Hi. Hi.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.098
Just for 20 seconds,
act like you don't hate me.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.766
- I'm Carol Finnerty.
- Hi. John.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.019
- Carol?
- Cale.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.147
Oh, my God. Carol Wilkes.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.107
Actually, I'm Carol Finnerty now.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.360
You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?

15:43.527 --> 15:44.820
Oh, you're Jenna's favour.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.993
This is Emily.
This is Em, my daughter.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.288
My father is a very special man.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.666
It's nice to meet you.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.668
I paid her to say that.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.088
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.259
I don't know. Just...

16:09.845 --> 16:11.180
Sorry, I gotta ask.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.891
You didn't marry Jim Finnerty
from Sigma Chi, did you?

16:14.057 --> 16:16.351
- That guy was...
- An asshole. Yes, he was.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.687
This is my colleague,
Special Agent Todd.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.856
Standard Secret Service
protocol requires...

16:21.023 --> 16:25.110
...a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.989
- I'm sorry, I just looked at him.
- You're only to look at me.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.408
So we just... Okay.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.579
The subject is John Cale.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.166
Born 1980,
grew up in the District of Columbia...

16:39.333 --> 16:41.210
...graduated Hill High in 1999.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.546
Looks like you've bounced
from job to job.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.965
Mechanic, limo driver, construction.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.634
Is my credit score in there?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.929
Yes, and you should be ashamed
of yourself.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.263
It's a recession, okay?

16:53.430 --> 16:56.767
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002...

16:56.934 --> 16:59.144
...and had a child six months later.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.730
Filed for divorce in 2005.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.108
So you did three tours
in Afghanistan...

17:06.276 --> 17:08.362
...and you were wounded
in the Kunar province.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.696
- Yes, ma'am.
- You received a Silver Star...

17:10.864 --> 17:13.784
...for pulling a Corporal Dawson
from a burning Humvee?

17:13.951 --> 17:16.828
There was an IED attack.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.748
Humvee flipped, we were taking fire,
so I grabbed him.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.750
- Why?
- I was a little concerned...

17:21.916 --> 17:24.377
...that he was getting
a little too warm in there.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.798
It's funny to me, you still think glib
is the way to go here.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.051
Corporal Dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house...

17:31.218 --> 17:33.303
...and when you were discharged
a year ago...

17:33.470 --> 17:35.639
...he got you a job
with the Capitol Police.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.475
Actually, on his protection detail.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.563
If Special Agent Todd
keeps making those sounds...

17:42.729 --> 17:46.650
- ...I'm gonna start looking at him.
- Will you give us a second, please, Ryan?

17:50.988 --> 17:54.157
John, why do you want to be
in the Secret Service?

17:55.742 --> 17:59.204
I can't think of a more important job
than protecting the president.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.790
Okay, this job requires
a university degree.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.376
You dropped out of GW
after our first semester there.

18:04.543 --> 18:08.255
- You don't finish things.
- Check the file, Carol.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.550
Two years in college night school.

18:11.717 --> 18:14.136
A certificate of graduation
should be in there.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.887
Great.

18:16.388 --> 18:20.350
Yeah, John, you barely maintained
a C average.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.061
I'm sorry, I didn't have
our little study sessions...

18:23.228 --> 18:25.230
...like we used to back in the day,
did I?

18:25.397 --> 18:27.190
Evaluations from your senior officers:

18:27.357 --> 18:30.485
"Cale frequently does not complete
his field reports on time."

18:30.652 --> 18:32.404
Nothing to do
with protecting someone.

18:32.571 --> 18:35.616
"Sergeant Cale demonstrates
a lack of respect for authority."

18:35.782 --> 18:39.453
"Sergeant Cale has raw potential
but seems determined not to realise it."

18:39.620 --> 18:42.039
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.499
I'm not the kid
you used to know in college.

18:44.666 --> 18:48.378
I've buttoned up every single thing
that I have to to qualify for this job.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.214
I have 10 times more experience
than any Ivy League kid.

18:51.381 --> 18:55.677
It's not just about experience. I would
need to depend on you every day.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.721
What do you want me to do?

18:57.888 --> 19:00.682
I'll start at the...
I'll start at the bottom.

19:01.642 --> 19:04.186
Just give me a chance.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.733
I'm sorry.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.742
Did you get the job?

19:22.412 --> 19:25.749
- Yeah, I think I got a shot.
- Really?

19:25.916 --> 19:27.417
You know how it is.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.170
They gotta go talk
amongst themselves and...

19:30.337 --> 19:34.341
These... Look, these things,
they can be really political.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.462
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.257
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.801
He has phone calls
to the congressional leadership.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.261
First lady is back tonight?

20:19.428 --> 20:21.596
Empress is wheels down at 1845.

20:21.763 --> 20:25.726
They're supposed to have dinner at the
residence, but you know how they are.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.062
So we should have an advance
on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.274
- What if she wants sushi?
- No, no, she's off sushi.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.651
Remember she had that thing
on the Japan trip?

20:34.818 --> 20:38.321
- Carol, how are you still awake?
- Caffeine and patriotism, sir.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.990
- Threat matrix?
- Well...

20:40.157 --> 20:43.160
...threats against POTUS
have quadrupled since the G8 speech.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.413
PID is keeping an eye on a guy
in Buffalo they're worried about.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.832
- Visitors today?
- Just the AV guys again.

20:48.999 --> 20:52.127
DC Sonic, they're replacing
the surround system in the theatre.

20:52.294 --> 20:55.672
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...

20:58.008 --> 20:59.509
She's coming back tonight?

21:01.011 --> 21:03.972
Carol, is she coming back tonight?

21:04.139 --> 21:07.476
Yes, sir. Wheels down at 1845.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.187
Yes, of course.

21:11.021 --> 21:14.441
As many of you are well-aware,
this is my last week here...

21:14.608 --> 21:16.651
...so I wanna make this clear
to everybody:

21:16.818 --> 21:19.863
If there are any congratulatory cakes
or any of that nonsense...

21:20.030 --> 21:23.533
...I will be compelled
to use deadly force.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.706
I hate you. I hate you all.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.714
Thank you. No incendiaries
in the White House.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.717
All right, baby,
I just gotta get my weapon real quick.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.386
You're gonna have to sign out, sir.
Hello.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.430
You guys here for the tour?

21:45.597 --> 21:47.849
Do you think we can see
where you'll be working?

21:49.684 --> 21:51.061
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.898
Gather around, everyone,
gather around. My name is Donnie...

21:55.065 --> 21:58.610
...and I'll be your guide today as we take
a walk through American history.

21:58.777 --> 22:02.739
I wanna give you all a warm Washington,
D.C. welcome to the White House...

22:02.906 --> 22:06.576
...where each year we get millions
of guests from every corner of the globe.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.078
Where are you folks from?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.080
Washington, D.C.

22:10.247 --> 22:13.959
- Bad choice. What about you, ma'am?
- Nebraska.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.752
What brings you to the White House?

22:15.919 --> 22:19.047
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK
snuck Marilyn Monroe in.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.634
Unfortunately, no such tunnels exist,
but don't worry, we have plenty...

22:22.801 --> 22:24.928
...of other exciting sights
to show you guys.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.138
Follow me this way.

22:27.305 --> 22:30.267
Now, does anyone wanna guess
how old the White House is?

22:30.433 --> 22:32.435
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.813
That's very accurate.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.648
Construction began in 1792...

22:36.815 --> 22:39.109
...on what was then called
the President's House.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.153
Now, Article 1, Section 8
of the U.S. Constitution set forth...

22:42.320 --> 22:44.781
...that a district of no more than
10 miles square...

22:44.948 --> 22:47.951
...should house the new seat
of government. Does anyone know why?

22:48.118 --> 22:50.954
So no one state could claim
the President's House.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.623
Right again.
You're a real keener, aren't you?

22:53.790 --> 22:55.417
Now, the founders were crafty...

22:55.584 --> 22:57.460
Hey, so you can tell me the truth.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.130
Do you get picked on a lot in school?

23:00.297 --> 23:02.048
No, I don't.

23:05.802 --> 23:10.765
- It's a gift certificate for a massage.
- I could use one.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.310
Martin, it's... It's been...

23:13.476 --> 23:16.938
I know, for me too, Ted.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.446
You know you're gonna miss this.

23:24.613 --> 23:27.866
- When's the last time you took a day off?
- Oh, I'm fine.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.409
I'm fine.

23:29.576 --> 23:33.246
Piece of advice:
You gotta get back on the horse.

23:34.289 --> 23:37.500
- Get back on the horse?
- First rule of divorce: Get right out there.

23:37.667 --> 23:41.338
Sow some oats, break some hearts,
have actual human interaction...

23:41.504 --> 23:44.174
...with a member of the opposite sex.

23:46.176 --> 23:51.014
Carol, you keep this up, 20 years
from now you're gonna look like me.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.141
Well, there are worse things.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.768
Don't make this your whole life.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.604
Trust me.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.774
It's not worth it.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.696
Go home.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.865
Get some rest.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.408
Now.

24:10.992 --> 24:13.620
And that is an order.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.122
Yes, sir.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.837
<i>Now, not too many people
realise this...</i>

24:23.004 --> 24:25.340
...but the White House
is actually three buildings:

24:25.507 --> 24:27.300
The East Wing
where you guys came in...

24:27.467 --> 24:30.637
...the West Wing, which houses
the Oval and Executive Offices...

24:30.804 --> 24:34.224
...and we're about to enter the residence,
which is the famous building that...

24:34.391 --> 24:37.602
...got blown up in <i>Independence Day.</i>
- What's in there?

24:37.769 --> 24:41.231
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.900
Right this way
through the double doors, please.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.236
There's still lots more to see.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.321
You got a visitor.

24:53.868 --> 24:54.995
Hey.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.038
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.748
Thank you.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.674
The White House is big.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.385
Including below-ground levels,
it's six storeys tall...

25:10.552 --> 25:16.599
...with 132 rooms, 412 doors,
147 windows, 28 fireplaces...

25:16.766 --> 25:18.476
...and 35 bathrooms.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.354
The grounds contain a tennis court,
a basketball court...

25:21.521 --> 25:24.274
...a putting green, a jogging track
and a swimming pool.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.943
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?

25:27.110 --> 25:30.196
She's referring to the Presidential
Emergency Operations Centre...

25:30.363 --> 25:33.825
...which is this really cool bunker
behind 10 feet of concrete and steel...

25:33.992 --> 25:36.911
...that's capable of surviving
a nuclear blast, plus...

25:37.078 --> 25:39.998
...for your information, miss,
it's the one room in the house...

25:40.165 --> 25:41.916
...that no one knows the location of.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.711
WikiLeaks says
it's under the East Wing.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.298
Who wants to see
the bowling alley, huh?

25:48.465 --> 25:50.091
- Oh, my God.
- How we doing, folks?

25:50.258 --> 25:51.801
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?

25:51.968 --> 25:53.428
You see the basketball court?

25:53.595 --> 25:56.473
Mr. President, can I ask you a question
for my YouTube channel?

25:56.639 --> 25:59.059
- That'd be all right. What's your name?
- Emily Cale.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.310
Emily Cale, go ahead.

26:00.477 --> 26:02.312
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?

26:02.479 --> 26:04.230
I wasn't ready for a press conference.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.692
How do you expect 22 Arab nations
with different regional...

26:07.859 --> 26:10.487
...and religious interests
to agree on a single treaty...

26:10.653 --> 26:12.989
...especially given the newly
erupting conflicts...

26:13.156 --> 26:15.909
...between the Shiites and the Sunnis
in southern Pakistan?

26:16.076 --> 26:17.327
Tough question.

26:18.161 --> 26:21.289
To be honest with you, I don't know.
Whether they'll agree or not...

26:21.456 --> 26:23.583
...I'm not sure, but I gotta try.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.669
The day we stop believing
different people can come together...

26:26.836 --> 26:29.798
...is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.

26:29.964 --> 26:32.050
What I am ready to do
is give a little girl...

26:32.217 --> 26:34.177
...a shout-out on her YouTube blog.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.680
Hi, folks,
my name is James W. Sawyer...

26:37.847 --> 26:40.725
...and I'm here with Emily Cale
and her video blog.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.227
Check it out.

26:42.393 --> 26:43.853
- You have a good one.
- Wait.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.189
Mr. President, this is my dad John.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.691
He's gonna be
on your Secret Service detail.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.652
Secret Service detail. Is that right?

26:50.819 --> 26:53.363
You know, I take my protection detail
very seriously.

26:53.530 --> 26:57.492
- Yes, sir.
- Stop lying to children.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.787
- Nice to meet you, Emily.
- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.039
You guys have a good one.
Need your vote now.

27:03.206 --> 27:05.125
Oh, my God, that was so fun.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.710
Thought you said no one
says "blog" anymore, huh?

27:09.838 --> 27:11.214
Bye, Fred.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.966
Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.720
Oil painting by Tom Freeman
to commemorate the burning...

27:17.887 --> 27:20.223
...of the White House
by the British in 1814.

27:20.390 --> 27:23.518
- Wait, the White House burned down?
- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.937
Practically had to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

27:26.104 --> 27:29.232
When I look at this painting,
I get very emotional.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.609
John.

27:31.776 --> 27:35.238
I think I need to avail myself
of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.615
There's a ladies' room downstairs.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.368
- Where? I'll take her.
- I can go by myself, John.

27:40.535 --> 27:41.744
I'm not a child.

27:41.911 --> 27:44.289
Hey, just don't touch anything
or wander off...

27:44.455 --> 27:47.000
...or talk to anybody
that you shouldn't be talking to.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.793
I make no promises.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.628
He's seven minutes behind.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.839
Sorry, he got hung up
on the State Floor.

27:53.006 --> 27:55.300
- Good morning, Margaret.
- Morning, Mr. President.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.719
Could you get the speaker
on the phone?

27:57.886 --> 27:58.928
Right away, sir.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.890
Have you and the missus zeroed in
on a dining establishment?

28:02.056 --> 28:04.559
When have you known the missus
to zero in on anything?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.269
Fair point, sir.

28:06.436 --> 28:08.730
Martin, I wanna shake your hand.

28:09.606 --> 28:12.275
- We're all sorry to see you go.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.361
And I know that you and Muriel
have had a tough go of it...

28:15.528 --> 28:18.198
- ...since Kevin passed, and...
- We all make sacrifices...

28:18.364 --> 28:20.700
- ...for our country, sir.
- Yeah, but it's more...

28:20.867 --> 28:22.785
I have the speaker of the house
for you.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.455
I'm sorry.

28:25.622 --> 28:27.207
Thank you, Mr. President.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.252
Right.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.505
- Thank you, Margaret.
- You're welcome, sir.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.719
- Eli.
- That was quite a speech, Mr. President.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.305
If you were on board,
we'd have a real shot at peace.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.808
You do know that your plan has upset
the entire defence industry.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.603
These are powerful people
who give money to both parties.

28:48.770 --> 28:52.065
I talked to President Al-Sharif again
about the discussion we had...

28:52.232 --> 28:54.776
...and he's assuring me
that he has proof.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.277
- And you believe him?
<i>- I do.</i>

28:56.444 --> 28:58.905
Guys that run those corporations
have been in bed...

28:59.072 --> 29:02.992
...with radical regimes for years. All they
wanna do is keep the cycle of war going.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.078
Al-Sharif will expose them.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.330
<i>All of that wrongdoing
is gonna come out...</i>

29:07.497 --> 29:10.833
<i>- ...as soon as our plan is signed.</i>
- Sir, if your plan is signed.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.182
Jesus.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.185
Since when do you guys
come through here?

29:29.769 --> 29:31.771
My supervisor told me
to come this way.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.439
Stop.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.784
Be careful next time.

29:45.868 --> 29:49.205
<i>I know we've had our differences,
but I've never known you to be a man...</i>

29:49.372 --> 29:52.208
<i>...to let politics stand in the way
of doing the right thing.</i>

29:52.375 --> 29:56.129
If you stand with me on this, you can be
the man that could take these guys down.

29:56.296 --> 29:59.215
I'd like to drag every one of these
CEOs in front of Congress...

29:59.382 --> 30:02.885
...but there's more at stake here.
I can't support this, not at the risk...

30:03.052 --> 30:04.804
...of leaving us militarily exposed.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.181
Come on, you know
those bases are for show now.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.976
<i>We could launch a drone
off of any carrier in the gulf...</i>

30:10.143 --> 30:11.561
<i>...and hit any target we want.</i>

30:23.906 --> 30:25.033
Excuse me, miss.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.577
Sir, you can't leave that there.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.495
Hey, buddy!

30:33.249 --> 30:35.752
Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda.
I got a maintenance...

30:54.270 --> 30:55.438
Eli, you all right?

30:55.605 --> 30:57.315
Keep moving, let's go, push.

30:57.482 --> 30:58.775
Get your security teams up.

31:00.610 --> 31:03.279
Mr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker?

31:03.446 --> 31:04.781
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.866
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.118
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.829
Tell him we need to institute
Continuity of Government.

31:11.996 --> 31:14.791
- I tried. He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.292
Don't panic, take your time.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.129
There's been an explosion
at the Capitol building.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.215
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.634
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.302
I want all nonessentials evac'd.

31:26.469 --> 31:30.139
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
Sergeant, bolt these doors.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.934
I need Marine 1 here
as fast as possible.

31:33.101 --> 31:35.520
Sir, I need you to move away
from the window, sir.

31:35.686 --> 31:36.854
Yeah.

31:38.231 --> 31:39.482
Lock down all these doors.

31:40.525 --> 31:42.193
- Do it quickly.
- Go, go, go!

31:42.360 --> 31:43.736
- Sir.
- The residence.

31:45.780 --> 31:46.823
Bear with us.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.033
Sir, we have a tour group
on the State Floor.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.327
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.912
Keep the hallways clear.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.748
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.000
No one goes anywhere
till we lift the crash.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.462
- She's just a little girl. I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.

32:05.425 --> 32:08.344
Keep moving, please. Everybody.

32:13.391 --> 32:16.227
Gentlemen, we're on lockdown.
You can't be in here.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.770
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

32:17.937 --> 32:19.647
- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!

32:19.814 --> 32:23.860
You gotta be kidding me. Movie time
is over. Shut this down! Let's go.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.282
Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds.
Silencer.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.326
Let's go.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.204
<i>Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

32:35.371 --> 32:37.165
<i>- We are on full lockdown.</i>
- Hey!

32:48.384 --> 32:49.844
We need help up here now!

32:59.729 --> 33:01.564
Security sweep! Open up!

33:06.027 --> 33:09.322
Thirty seconds. Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.497
Armoury secure.

33:22.752 --> 33:25.004
All right, let's go. Let's move, move!

33:25.171 --> 33:28.049
- Hold up. We're on full lockdown here.
- Hey!

33:40.478 --> 33:43.272
East Hall secure.
Heading for Castle Sky.

33:48.903 --> 33:52.532
<i>You've reached the voice mail of
Emily Cale. Why aren't you texting me?</i>

33:52.698 --> 33:55.034
Em, as soon as you get this,
call me back.

33:56.827 --> 34:00.122
- Keep moving, keep moving!
- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.750
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?

34:02.917 --> 34:06.420
I have Eagle. Call WFO, get as
many men as you can to the Capitol.

34:06.587 --> 34:10.507
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.

34:10.675 --> 34:12.467
A hard perimeter around Castle.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.054
Eastside Gate.
Come on, let's go, people.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.764
Fred, open the gate.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.060
We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.271
- They're exiting the building.
- Keep moving!

34:23.437 --> 34:24.647
Castle South clear.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.030
Clear!

34:35.491 --> 34:36.951
We have Castle Sky.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.837
<i>Five agents in the East Gate,
four in the garden.</i>

34:48.004 --> 34:51.424
<i>The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.</i>

34:51.591 --> 34:53.759
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Let's go! Keep moving!

34:57.054 --> 34:59.974
Shots fired. Code Black! Code Black!

35:00.141 --> 35:02.685
- Say again. Say again.
- He said "shots fired."

35:02.852 --> 35:05.354
Look, it's gotta be an AOP.
You gotta get out there.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.189
- Stand back.
- I'm not doing anything.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.608
You serious? Look around.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.526
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!

35:10.693 --> 35:11.736
Go out and do your job!

35:11.902 --> 35:13.988
Donnie, where'd
you send my daughter?

35:14.155 --> 35:17.199
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.660
Well, not today, it's not.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.830
<i>- You've reached the voice mail...</i>
- Em, pick up the phone.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.545
Can't tell where it's coming from.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.422
I have no visual on him.

35:32.548 --> 35:35.009
Ten-four. Still have them on...?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.302
No.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.687
- Clear!
- Clear!

35:57.073 --> 35:59.158
<i>Negative, negative.
Snipers on the roof.</i>

35:59.325 --> 36:02.912
<i>Do not approach Castle.
Repeat, do not approach Castle.</i>

36:03.079 --> 36:04.664
<i>Do not advance. Do not advance.</i>

36:24.100 --> 36:26.268
Say what?

36:26.435 --> 36:28.437
Welcome to the White House,
Mr. Tyler.

36:28.604 --> 36:31.774
I love what you've done with the place.
Bullet holes add to the decor.

36:32.942 --> 36:35.903
Did you see that shit Conrad pulled off
at the Capitol? Goddamn!

36:36.070 --> 36:38.280
Let's keep it tight. Get to work.

36:38.948 --> 36:41.242
Where are my goddamn hostages?

36:42.743 --> 36:44.203
- Dad?
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>

36:44.370 --> 36:45.705
<i>- Emily, are you okay?</i>
- Dad...

36:45.871 --> 36:48.416
<i>Look, it's gonna be okay,
baby, I promise you.</i>

36:48.582 --> 36:51.127
- Where are you?
- Where are you at? I'll come get you.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.176
Where'd you send my daughter?

36:59.343 --> 37:02.054
Downstairs. Across the hall,
second on the left.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.349
Shut up!

37:37.131 --> 37:39.467
Find him. Go!

37:41.010 --> 37:43.971
- What's going on?
- What? I got it.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.848
You better.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.686
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are on final approach.</i>

37:53.230 --> 37:56.650
- What are we waiting for, Martin?
- Marine 1 is three minutes out, sir.

37:58.611 --> 38:01.030
Castle, does anybody copy?
I repeat, we are...

38:04.533 --> 38:08.370
Break right! Break right!
We are taking fire. Castle has fallen.

38:08.537 --> 38:11.207
<i>The White House is down.
Heavy weapons on the roof.</i>

38:11.373 --> 38:13.793
- Take him to the PEOC.
- They're in the building.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.795
- We need to exfilt...
- I got this!

38:15.961 --> 38:19.548
Mr. President, Mr. President,
I get you to the vault...

38:19.715 --> 38:21.050
...their game is over.

38:21.217 --> 38:23.552
You sure you can get me there?

38:23.719 --> 38:25.971
Yes, sir. I am.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.098
Then get me to the vault.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.894
Diamond formation. Stay low,
stay close, shoot first. Got it? On me.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.151
Do you have the vice president?

38:39.318 --> 38:41.779
<i>- I repeat, do you have the vice president?</i>
- We do.

38:41.946 --> 38:44.240
- We're two miles away from Andrews.
- The speaker?

38:44.406 --> 38:46.659
Negative. We do not have the speaker.

38:46.826 --> 38:49.203
- Please evacuate the Capitol.
- This way. Excuse me.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.412
Kellerman!

38:50.579 --> 38:52.540
Carol, COD says
we go to the Pentagon.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.084
I have the speaker.
Going to the secondary location.

38:55.251 --> 38:57.294
Watch yourself.
Excuse me, ma'am.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.424
Downstairs, second door to the left.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.932
Emily.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.202
No, no, no, please. Please don't!
I was just on the tour!

39:30.369 --> 39:32.454
- You had a gun!
- It's a phone, it's a phone.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.416
- I swear. Look, I got a daughter. Please.
- Get up!

39:35.583 --> 39:36.876
Okay.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.801
That was close.

39:45.968 --> 39:47.720
Shit.

39:47.887 --> 39:50.055
You think you're tough, bitch?

39:55.352 --> 39:57.980
<i>Keep the ground floor clear.
Package is on the move.</i>

40:02.651 --> 40:05.404
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
We are coming in hot.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.407
<i>Copy that, sir.
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.</i>

40:08.741 --> 40:10.576
Go, go!

40:13.621 --> 40:16.790
Mr. President. Glasses.

40:18.334 --> 40:20.502
Match. We're in. Go!

40:22.588 --> 40:25.174
Go ahead. I'll button this up.
Go ahead.

40:27.718 --> 40:29.803
<i>Mr. Vice President,
I apologise in advance...</i>

40:29.970 --> 40:32.765
<i>...but this is gonna be the hardest takeoff
you've ever felt.</i>

40:32.932 --> 40:35.476
<i>We're gonna put this bird
at 30,000 feet in 45 seconds.</i>

40:44.068 --> 40:46.528
James William Sawyer.

40:51.784 --> 40:54.620
Gentlemen. What are you doing?!

40:55.621 --> 40:57.790
Please, Martin, what are you doing?

40:59.333 --> 41:01.210
I'm sorry, Ted.

41:02.628 --> 41:06.006
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.

41:06.173 --> 41:09.510
Emily? Where are you at, baby?

41:09.677 --> 41:12.096
Please tell me you got out of here.

41:13.263 --> 41:16.392
Mr. Stenz. We're in.

41:16.558 --> 41:17.893
I have the package.

41:18.727 --> 41:22.856
<i>Ground floor, through the library
and down the stairs.</i>

41:23.023 --> 41:26.360
<i>- The library. We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.</i>

41:32.324 --> 41:34.284
That's the library.

41:35.369 --> 41:38.914
Don't go in there. Just...
Oh, this is so stupid.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.751
You're not gonna get away with this.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.420
Martin! What are you doing?

41:44.586 --> 41:48.257
No, Mr. President. The question is,
what are you gonna do?

41:48.424 --> 41:51.093
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?

41:51.844 --> 41:53.887
Is this about Kevin? Look, I'm sorry...

41:55.848 --> 41:57.933
Run, Mr. President!
To me, to me, to me!

42:03.480 --> 42:05.274
Move!

42:05.441 --> 42:06.692
<i>Walker.</i>

42:07.901 --> 42:09.236
Move, move, move!

42:11.321 --> 42:13.323
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

42:15.159 --> 42:17.870
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
- Walker, I say again...

42:18.037 --> 42:20.456
...we are coming to you,
we are on the move.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.127
In the library.

42:25.294 --> 42:27.254
- Shit. I'm empty.
- Walker!

42:31.925 --> 42:33.302
Run, run, run!

42:35.095 --> 42:36.138
Stenz!

42:36.805 --> 42:38.474
No, not that way! They're up there!

42:44.021 --> 42:45.481
Goddamn!

42:45.647 --> 42:47.941
<i>We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.</i>

42:48.108 --> 42:49.735
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.

42:52.988 --> 42:54.990
Run, Mr. President! Move! Move!

42:58.285 --> 42:59.536
This leads to the basement.

42:59.703 --> 43:02.456
<i>- We're in the stairwell, coming your way.</i>
- Shit.

43:10.464 --> 43:11.965
We gotta go!

43:13.509 --> 43:15.260
Elevator's here, let's go!

43:20.182 --> 43:22.935
Shit! God!
They're in the elevator heading up!

43:23.102 --> 43:26.188
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing? Get him!

43:26.355 --> 43:27.523
Take care of Bobby.

43:30.651 --> 43:33.362
<i>- Killick, stop them at the elevator.</i>
- I'm on it.

43:35.864 --> 43:38.283
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!

43:39.034 --> 43:40.953
Son of a bitch!
You screwed us, Walker.

43:41.120 --> 43:43.122
You've got one of your guys
running around.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.124
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?

43:45.290 --> 43:48.043
I don't know, probably some schmuck
from one of the tours.

43:48.210 --> 43:51.672
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
So now I'm gonna take care of it!

43:51.839 --> 43:55.008
No, you will not.
You will have your boys...

43:55.175 --> 43:57.010
...sweep every room in this place.

43:57.177 --> 44:00.055
And you will come with me,
as planned.

44:01.849 --> 44:03.225
Find him.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.565
You don't talk to me like that
in front of my men.

44:09.731 --> 44:11.066
- I don't, huh?
- No, you don't!

44:11.233 --> 44:12.568
Ten years I've known Bobby!

44:12.734 --> 44:15.487
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!

44:15.654 --> 44:17.656
Drop the tough-guy shit
with me, junior.

44:17.823 --> 44:19.241
Now, I know your story, Emil.

44:19.408 --> 44:21.201
I know what this country did to you.

44:21.368 --> 44:23.704
We're in this together. So be calm.

44:23.871 --> 44:25.122
- I'm calm.
- Good.

44:25.289 --> 44:28.167
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.670
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.850
You promised me the leader
of the free world.

44:45.017 --> 44:48.020
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.

44:48.187 --> 44:50.939
But without him, what kind
of time frame we looking at?

44:51.106 --> 44:53.942
We have 15 minutes to load in,
then maybe another 30 or so...

44:54.109 --> 44:57.237
...to crack the protocols without his code.
After that, it's on you.

44:57.404 --> 45:00.741
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.

45:00.908 --> 45:02.409
- Good.
- Do you know...

45:02.576 --> 45:05.871
...you've got a bit of something right...
It's right under your nose.

45:22.012 --> 45:23.639
Vadim.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.142
You let me know the second
you find these guys.

45:27.309 --> 45:28.685
<i>Copy that.</i>

45:28.852 --> 45:31.813
Somebody please shut the alarm off!

45:33.690 --> 45:35.275
I got work to do.

45:36.485 --> 45:38.153
Motts.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.781
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.

45:42.991 --> 45:44.159
I'll show you the way.

45:44.326 --> 45:46.495
We got some important people
waiting for us.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.502
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm all right.

45:53.669 --> 45:56.672
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.

45:56.838 --> 45:59.841
- Your daughter, where's your daughter?
- I couldn't find her.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.802
I hope she got out.

46:01.969 --> 46:03.303
Do you know these men?

46:03.470 --> 46:06.223
That old son of a bitch,
his name is Martin Walker.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.350
He's the head of my Secret Service.

46:08.517 --> 46:12.229
You should have a conversation about
how serious you take your protection.

46:12.396 --> 46:15.065
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?

46:15.232 --> 46:18.026
I think it has something to do
with his son Kevin.

46:18.193 --> 46:20.028
- Why? What happened?
- He was a Marine.

46:20.195 --> 46:23.949
He got killed last year
in this covert action that I ordered.

46:24.116 --> 46:27.953
Would he do this for a personal
vendetta? He said he wanted you alive.

46:28.578 --> 46:30.789
There's gotta be a bigger play.

46:31.206 --> 46:34.293
We gotta get out
of this elevator shaft.

46:34.459 --> 46:35.877
I'm...

46:36.044 --> 46:37.879
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.888
Oh, my God.
The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.016
Where's the secretary
of Homeland Security?

46:49.182 --> 46:52.019
- He's at the White House.
- Who's the deputy sec?

46:52.185 --> 46:55.522
Wyck Halsey.
He's also at the White House.

46:55.689 --> 46:57.482
Oh, Jesus.

46:57.649 --> 47:00.861
<i>...happens,
our thoughts go to terrorism.</i>

47:01.445 --> 47:03.113
I've had enough of this.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.157
Walker told us to stay where we are.

47:06.658 --> 47:08.744
Madam Secretary, gentlemen...

47:08.910 --> 47:11.413
...I'm gonna ask you to accompany us
to the Blue Room.

47:11.580 --> 47:13.999
- Who is this man?
- He is...

47:14.166 --> 47:16.877
- He's a concerned citizen.
- Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

47:21.631 --> 47:25.427
- You killed the secretary of defence.
- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job.

47:25.594 --> 47:27.763
Okay, so,
would the remaining secretaries...

47:27.929 --> 47:30.140
...please join us in the Blue Room?

47:33.477 --> 47:35.604
- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid.
- How they doing?

47:35.771 --> 47:37.481
VP just puked all over Air Force One.

47:37.647 --> 47:40.442
I'm General Caulfield,
vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.

47:40.609 --> 47:42.611
Have the nuclear launch codes
been switched?

47:42.778 --> 47:45.781
- Yes, and new codes are active.
- The stock market's collapsing.

47:46.448 --> 47:49.117
Travis, I need you
to suspend trading immediately.

47:49.284 --> 47:52.454
And there's gonna be a run on the banks,
so close them now.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.298
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.

48:03.465 --> 48:04.966
Don't mess it up.

48:07.719 --> 48:08.804
Son of a...

48:08.970 --> 48:10.472
Captain, where are we?

48:10.639 --> 48:13.809
We have reason to believe
that the explosive was a diversion.

48:13.975 --> 48:15.060
Diversion from what?

48:15.227 --> 48:17.396
An armed team
has taken over the White House.

48:17.562 --> 48:18.772
Do we have the president?

48:18.939 --> 48:20.941
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.

48:21.108 --> 48:22.734
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.

48:22.901 --> 48:26.238
Radio chatter indicated they were headed
for the PEOC. No contact.

48:26.405 --> 48:28.782
We have to assume
they've been compromised.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.742
We gotta get you to a phone.

48:30.909 --> 48:32.869
Call SEAL Team Six
and they come in here...

48:33.036 --> 48:35.288
...and they'll shoot these assholes
in the head.

48:35.455 --> 48:38.834
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great. Where's that at?

48:40.752 --> 48:42.504
Of course it is.

48:42.671 --> 48:44.881
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?

48:45.048 --> 48:47.259
Unless you got a better idea, yeah.

48:47.426 --> 48:49.594
No, I don't.

48:49.761 --> 48:52.848
By the way, John Cale.

48:53.849 --> 48:55.976
- James Sawyer.
- I'll get you out of here, sir.

48:56.143 --> 48:57.686
Just follow me up.

48:59.229 --> 49:01.815
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

49:02.315 --> 49:03.942
Make sure you have one handhold...

49:04.109 --> 49:07.362
- ...before you let go of the other one.
- Whatever you do, I'll do.

49:11.658 --> 49:13.160
I ain't doing that shit.

49:16.329 --> 49:20.125
The scene here at the White House
is getting more chaotic every second.

49:20.292 --> 49:21.668
We have got hundreds...

49:21.835 --> 49:24.713
As you can see,
the military's moving into position...

49:24.880 --> 49:28.383
...but won't advance because of
safety concerns for the hostages.

49:28.550 --> 49:31.303
<i>...obvious to everyone,
this is the work of al Qaeda...</i>

49:31.470 --> 49:34.222
<i>...or some like-minded
Arab terrorist group.</i>

49:34.389 --> 49:36.892
<i>- The National Guard...</i>
- The building's buttoned up.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.393
Rooftop's secure.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.313
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.

49:41.480 --> 49:43.982
- Apparently, we're all Arabs.
- Good.

49:44.149 --> 49:45.775
- Cake?
- No, I don't want cake.

49:45.942 --> 49:47.569
I'm diabetic.

49:52.574 --> 49:54.284
Hallelujah.

49:57.204 --> 49:59.706
This is my Graceland!

50:08.340 --> 50:09.591
Sweet Shiva.

50:09.758 --> 50:12.260
Sugary pops of delight.

50:19.476 --> 50:22.103
Come on, let's go! Move!

50:23.021 --> 50:26.525
Let's go, sheeple.
Now, welcome to my house.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.777
Now, sit down and shut up!

50:28.944 --> 50:30.779
Oh, baby, I've missed you.

50:32.781 --> 50:36.368
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.

50:38.537 --> 50:40.747
Ladies and gentlemen,
Skip Tyler has arrived.

50:40.914 --> 50:44.584
By the time you're watching this,
I will have pulled off the greatest hack...

50:44.751 --> 50:47.671
...the world has ever seen.
This is difficult for some, it is...

50:47.837 --> 50:52.968
...but for me, it's as easy as
one, two, three...

50:53.134 --> 50:56.888
...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

51:01.768 --> 51:04.563
Yes.

51:08.567 --> 51:09.818
Showtime!

51:20.161 --> 51:23.832
Oh, some latecomers.
Secretary of Homeland Security...

51:23.999 --> 51:27.377
...is in the house!
You're so getting fired for this.

51:27.544 --> 51:31.172
- Look who was hiding in the Press Room.
- Oh, my God, Roger Skinner!

51:31.339 --> 51:35.176
The only one who speaks the truth.
I love your show. Seriously.

51:35.343 --> 51:38.513
After you, please. Get in there.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.170
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

52:12.672 --> 52:15.592
Playing some hide-and-seek, little girl?

52:15.759 --> 52:20.388
Well, then, I will huff, and I will puff...

52:20.555 --> 52:23.016
...and I'm gonna blow your house down.

52:33.193 --> 52:36.696
- No, no, no! Leave me alone.
- Get in here.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.823
- Move!
- Mr. Skinner, please stop crying.

52:38.990 --> 52:40.992
Get comfortable, you little mutt.

52:43.078 --> 52:44.871
Are you okay?

52:46.665 --> 52:49.668
- Oh, my God, where's my dad?
- He went looking for you.

52:55.924 --> 52:57.676
Excuse me for a second.

53:02.764 --> 53:04.265
Sir?

53:04.432 --> 53:05.975
Hi.

53:07.268 --> 53:09.938
I understand that this is
a very high-stress time...

53:10.105 --> 53:13.733
...but if you and your colleagues...

53:13.900 --> 53:15.902
...could maybe be
a little more careful...

53:16.069 --> 53:19.197
...with the priceless artefacts
that are in this building...

53:19.364 --> 53:23.368
...because I mean, it is a living history...
Okay, because see...

53:23.535 --> 53:25.787
...that was a Ming Dynasty
16th-century vase...

53:25.954 --> 53:29.290
...that was a gift from
Queen Elizabeth II. It's irreplaceable.

53:32.961 --> 53:36.798
I'll go sit down. I'm gonna... I'll be over
here if you have any more questions.

53:36.965 --> 53:38.758
<i>Vadim, Chen, report.</i>

53:38.925 --> 53:42.262
We're done with the residence, boss.
Coming up to the third floor.

53:49.853 --> 53:51.354
Shit.

53:53.815 --> 53:55.442
Okay, I'm coming up.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.794
Get your head down!

54:32.270 --> 54:33.938
What are you doing?

54:34.105 --> 54:37.358
- Trying to shoot off the cables?
- I heard something.

54:37.525 --> 54:40.737
Come on. That thing's 100 years old.
The shit's too heavy for it.

54:40.904 --> 54:42.864
Let's unload before it snaps.

54:47.535 --> 54:50.371
- Jesus, they have Javelins.
- Javelin what?

54:50.538 --> 54:52.165
Surface-to-air missiles.

54:52.332 --> 54:54.834
If anybody comes in by air,
they're done.

54:55.001 --> 54:57.212
Mr. Speaker,
I have the vice president for you.

54:57.378 --> 54:58.713
- Alvin, you okay?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

54:58.880 --> 55:00.381
<i>Who's in command on the ground?</i>

55:00.548 --> 55:02.383
- Well...
- Permission to speak freely.

55:02.550 --> 55:04.677
<i>- Yeah, yeah, granted.</i>
- It's a shit show.

55:04.844 --> 55:07.889
D.C. police are on the scene,
FBI is trying to horn in...

55:08.056 --> 55:10.475
...plus Secret Service feels it
should be their show.

55:10.642 --> 55:13.686
It should. Carol Finnerty,
Secret Service.

55:13.853 --> 55:16.397
Mr. Vice President,
it was our building that was taken.

55:16.564 --> 55:19.400
Yes, it was, and now
you're standing in our building.

55:19.567 --> 55:22.737
<i>We need to send the Army in there
and take the White House back.</i>

55:22.904 --> 55:26.407
I don't think you can. Posse
Comitatus and the Insurrection Act...

55:26.574 --> 55:29.661
...make it very difficult to deploy
combat troops on American soil.

55:29.828 --> 55:32.539
Which is why we federalized
the National Guard minutes ago.

55:32.705 --> 55:35.416
Sir, with respect,
only the president can do that.

55:35.583 --> 55:38.336
Alvin, we're in
a constitutional crisis here.

55:38.503 --> 55:40.421
We've never had
a missing chief executive.

55:40.588 --> 55:43.258
<i>We're gonna have to start talking
about the 25th Amendment.</i>

55:43.424 --> 55:45.552
You wanna remove the president
from power?

55:45.718 --> 55:48.429
<i>I don't wanna do anything,
but I can't sit here...</i>

55:48.596 --> 55:51.224
<i>...and watch the government come
crashing down around us.</i>

55:51.391 --> 55:53.393
We've tried them on the phone
by now, right?

55:53.560 --> 55:54.727
Who?

56:07.782 --> 56:08.783
Hello?

56:08.950 --> 56:12.954
Hello, this is Special Agent Carol
Finnerty. To whom am I speaking?

56:13.121 --> 56:17.125
That sounds official. Please hold.
Your call's very important to us.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.088
<i>- We've got an incoming call.</i>
- About time.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.383
Put them through.

56:28.177 --> 56:30.346
Thank you for holding.
I'll patch you through.

56:30.513 --> 56:32.307
Have a great day.

56:32.473 --> 56:35.476
Hello, this is Carol Finnerty.
Who is this?

56:35.643 --> 56:37.896
It's me, Carol.
You should've called already.

56:38.062 --> 56:40.565
- Martin.
<i>- We've held the building for 15 minutes.</i>

56:40.732 --> 56:42.775
- "We"?
- I'm sure you're recording this...

56:42.942 --> 56:46.279
...so let's make this easy on everybody.
My name is Martin James Walker.

56:46.446 --> 56:49.157
<i>Chief of the presidential detail
of the Secret Service.</i>

56:49.324 --> 56:52.493
My men currently control the
White House and the 61 hostages within.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.913
- What are you doing?
- I did you the courtesy...

56:55.079 --> 56:58.458
...of sending you out of here,
so let's just keep it professional, okay?

56:58.625 --> 57:00.418
"Professional"?

57:00.585 --> 57:03.046
You killed your own men.

57:03.630 --> 57:05.381
Where's Ted?

57:05.548 --> 57:07.300
Killing Ted Hope...

57:08.301 --> 57:11.346
...was the second hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

57:15.516 --> 57:17.435
Martin, I want you to...

57:17.602 --> 57:20.563
There's not a thing you're about to say
that I didn't teach you.

57:20.730 --> 57:24.567
So we're gonna get all this done in
two hours and be done by lunch, okay?

57:24.734 --> 57:26.986
Now, ask me what I want.

57:28.196 --> 57:30.323
- What do you want?
<i>- On any given day...</i>

57:30.490 --> 57:35.370
...the United States Federal Reserve
holds in excess of $400 million in cash.

57:35.536 --> 57:38.539
And I want it loaded aboard
a Boeing C-17...

57:38.706 --> 57:42.710
...which you will leave fuelled and
otherwise empty on runway one-niner.

57:42.877 --> 57:46.047
I'd like to know how you plan
on getting from the White House...

57:46.214 --> 57:48.216
...to Reagan National
without being killed.

57:48.383 --> 57:51.678
We have eyes in the sky.
If I see a single sniper...

57:51.844 --> 57:55.640
...within 10 miles of this place,
I am going to kill...

57:55.807 --> 57:57.141
<i>...four Cabinet members...</i>

57:57.308 --> 57:59.894
<i>...and in a particularly nice
touch of irony...</i>

58:00.061 --> 58:02.897
...the director
of Homeland Security himself.

58:03.064 --> 58:04.732
Is President Sawyer alive?

58:07.485 --> 58:10.071
- Yes.
- I want proof of life.

58:10.238 --> 58:13.324
You got two hours
or I will execute him myself...

58:13.491 --> 58:16.077
...on the South Lawn
of the White House.

58:17.870 --> 58:20.581
<i>Jesus, the head of his own detail.</i>

58:20.748 --> 58:22.750
At least we know
how they got in so easily.

58:22.917 --> 58:25.336
Can we be sure he's the only
Secret Service member...

58:25.503 --> 58:28.172
- ...who's been compromised?
- Oh, go to hell.

58:28.339 --> 58:29.382
Proof of life, huh?

58:29.549 --> 58:32.385
You say you can do better
than your men. Here's your chance.

58:32.552 --> 58:34.721
- Find him.
- With pleasure.

58:35.763 --> 58:38.933
Walker's wife, Muriel, is in Fairfax.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.727
Could you find her, please?

58:42.645 --> 58:43.938
You okay?

58:44.105 --> 58:46.399
I have Thanksgiving
at their house every year.

58:46.566 --> 58:49.110
I wanna run the whole search again,
from the top.

58:49.277 --> 58:52.071
Motts, meet me on the ground floor.
Chen, Vadim, the third.

58:52.238 --> 58:53.281
<i>Meet in the middle.</i>

58:53.448 --> 58:56.576
Roger that. I'm taking the stairs.
Mulcahy, finish up.

58:56.743 --> 58:57.827
That was the last one.

58:57.994 --> 58:59.787
Wait, so you said Walker's son died?

58:59.954 --> 59:03.791
The Pentagon thought that Iran
had a nuclear bomb. We sent a team in.

59:03.958 --> 59:06.294
Things went wrong.
Martin's son Kevin got killed.

59:06.461 --> 59:09.505
- You're telling me this is personal?
- He's not doing it by himself.

59:09.672 --> 59:11.507
- Someone else is footing the bill.
- Who?

59:11.674 --> 59:13.551
Heard of
the military-industrial complex?

59:13.718 --> 59:15.678
Those are the manufacturers
of the weapons.

59:15.845 --> 59:20.141
They think they own the system and
they will do anything to keep that power.

59:20.641 --> 59:22.226
They profit off of your sacrifice.

59:22.393 --> 59:24.812
Politicians always love
talking about sacrifice.

59:24.979 --> 59:27.231
Think I don't know anything
about sacrifice?

59:27.398 --> 59:29.859
How many people come to your house
and wanna kill you?

59:30.026 --> 59:32.070
Missiles are topside.

59:34.489 --> 59:36.449
Elevator going down to one.

59:40.661 --> 59:43.164
- We gotta get off on the second floor.
- What?

59:43.331 --> 59:44.916
Get off, get off, get off.

59:45.833 --> 59:48.753
- You all right? You see anybody?
- No, we're clear.

59:48.920 --> 59:50.421
Kick it in. Harder.

59:55.510 --> 59:57.178
Mr. President, stay on my hip.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:02.058
I got three rounds. Tell me you got
some weapons in the residence.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:05.103
No, we usually have two agents
right there with machine guns.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.188
- We got some knives in the kitchen.
- What?

01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:08.356
They're big knives.

01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:10.858
Great, then you can
make me a sandwich.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.944
Now, where's the phone?

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.493
Right here.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.663
Walker set this number up.
Wait a minute, he's gonna trace it.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:26.290
We gotta get in touch
with somebody on the outside.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.042
- I got somebody.
- You got somebody?

01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:30.336
- Yeah, yeah.
- I need to get my shoes.

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:49.730
Needed this.

01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:58.156
- Hello?
- Jenna, this is John Cale.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.825
John, not a good time.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:02.410
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

01:01:02.577 --> 01:01:05.830
- Close friend?
- She works for the vice president.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.667
Have you heard what's happening?
It's not a good time.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:12.545
I'm with the president.
We're in the White House.

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:15.590
- That's not funny, John.
- Does this sound like a joke to you?

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:18.426
- Yeah, he's...
- Jenna, this is James Sawyer.

01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:22.013
<i>For the past 10 minutes, I've been
getting shot at with this young man.</i>

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.641
If you could connect me to whatever
control structure we still have left...

01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:27.977
...I would really appreciate it.
- Hold on.

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:30.771
Hello? Thank you.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:33.024
She hung up?

01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:37.737
She put me on hold
when I was thanking her.

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:43.618
So we wait for your best friend Jenna
to hit us back.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.041
You smoke?

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.377
Neither do I.

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:57.298
This is your moment, sir.

01:01:57.465 --> 01:02:00.718
The country is looking for a leader.
It's your time to step up.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:02.720
I told you, we weren't to be disturbed.

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:05.139
The president of the United States
called my cell.

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:07.516
<i>- Mr. President.
- It's about damn time.</i>

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:10.228
<i>- Mr. President, are you all right?</i>
- We're safe.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.063
- "We"?
- Yeah, I'm with someone.

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.773
I'm gonna put him on the phone.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.650
- Hello, this is John Cale.
- Cale?

01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:17.610
What are you doing
in the White House?

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:20.696
- He's doing a damn good job.
- It's a long story, Mr. Speaker...

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:24.075
...but look, they've taken the building
and they're holding hostages.

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:26.786
- This is when you come get us.
- We're doing our best.

01:02:26.953 --> 01:02:30.331
- Do we have any intel on these people?
<i>- We are working on that, sir.</i>

01:02:30.498 --> 01:02:32.458
You have to get the president
out of there.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:35.002
- Can you get to the basement?
- Yeah, sure.

01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:36.963
- Yeah.
<i>- There's a series of tunnels.</i>

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.090
JFK used them to sneak Marilyn in.

01:02:39.257 --> 01:02:41.175
- I thought that was a myth.
- It's true.

01:02:41.342 --> 01:02:42.593
Donnie's gonna be pissed.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.179
<i>Get to the basement.
I'll lead you to the tunnels.</i>

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:48.891
Okay, Carol, I got separated from Emily.
Can you tell me if she made it out?

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:53.020
We're gonna find her, but you have got
to get the president to safety, okay?

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.448
Cale? Cale? Can you get him back?

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.234
Son of a bitch!

01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:58.002
Get your hands off my Jordans!

01:04:08.429 --> 01:04:10.598
Freeze! I said freeze!

01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:12.058
Shoot him!

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:13.726
No, don't shoot him.

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.274
Shoot him!

01:04:26.197 --> 01:04:27.740
Shit.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:38.417
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:40.211
Don't worry about him.

01:04:40.378 --> 01:04:44.173
He would've killed me
if you wouldn't have killed him.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.636
Thanks, asshole.

01:04:48.803 --> 01:04:50.971
Look what I found. Merry Christmas.

01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:53.474
- You got the satphone?
- Right here.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:54.975
And it's on.

01:04:56.936 --> 01:05:00.147
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- Define "okay."

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.732
<i>What happened, John?</i>

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:04.151
We got two dead bad guys,
that's what happened.

01:05:04.318 --> 01:05:07.863
These guys had military training. You
gotta find out what they're doing here.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:09.198
<i>Walker demanded a ransom.</i>

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:11.992
You think they're going through this
for money?

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:14.245
- You need to see this.
<i>- Hang on, John.</i>

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:16.330
<i>...people watching all of this together.</i>

01:05:16.497 --> 01:05:19.542
<i>No doubt young Emily Cale
had to risk her own life to...</i>

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:23.921
Can you get me the president here?
Cale, can you turn on the news?

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.673
You got a TV?

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.426
We need to find out how Walker
found these guys.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.178
<i>- John, you've gotta turn on the news.</i>
- What's going on?

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:32.471
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:35.808
<i>What you are seeing really is
just amazing footage...</i>

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:40.813
<i>...captured by an extremely brave
young girl by the name of Emily Cale.</i>

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.817
<i>Now, these are the first images coming
to us from inside the White House...</i>

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.445
<i>...from inside this hostage situation.</i>

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:52.366
<i>The images have gone viral. They've
had more than a hundred million...</i>

01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:54.160
Wait. Cale, Cale, listen.

01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:57.163
We're all walking out of here together,
okay?

01:05:57.329 --> 01:05:58.789
I gotta go get her.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.207
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:03.544
Get me facial recognition
on everyone in that video now.

01:06:03.711 --> 01:06:06.714
<i>...very brave young girl
named Emily Cale.</i>

01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:08.883
<i>The hostages include the nine girls...</i>

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.844
<i>...from Watkins Charter School
in Louisville...</i>

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:13.888
<i>...five Cabinet members as well...</i>

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:17.933
<i>...and also, understandably,
a very emotional Roger Skinner.</i>

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.894
<i>And from what I understand now...</i>

01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:33.908
I got the president a scrambled
satphone to call his family with.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:37.578
<i>He keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence. See if it's still there.</i>

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.040
No. No.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:53.719
Vadim, would you be kind enough
to confirm your last name for me, please?

01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:57.306
- Let's go.
- They're in the residence.

01:06:57.473 --> 01:06:59.016
Go! That's them in the residence.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.603
Easy.

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:11.695
<i>...And the faces of the terrorists.</i>

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.572
You gotta be shitting me.

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:16.742
<i>So we are going to put those faces
up on-screen right now...</i>

01:07:16.909 --> 01:07:18.285
In here!

01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:21.372
<i>As we put these faces up on-screen,
we are sure that we will...</i>

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:24.208
<i>...no doubt learn the names
of the men who are...</i>

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:26.710
<i>...holding the White House hostage.</i>

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:30.130
<i>These men are clearly not al Qaeda.</i>

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:33.884
<i>We are positive
that the FBI will have...</i>

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:36.971
<i>...those images out.
So again, these are images...</i>

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:38.847
<i>...captured by a brave young girl...</i>

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.934
How many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up?

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:46.355
Hey.

01:07:46.939 --> 01:07:50.484
How you like your chair?
You comfortable, Mr. Skinner?

01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:52.611
Let me ask you a question.

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:55.322
Where do you come up with
all the ideas for your show?

01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:59.159
- I...
- You got guys who do that for you?

01:07:59.827 --> 01:08:03.122
Because, believe me,
I got some good ideas.

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.013
Hey!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.477
Give it to me.

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:40.367
Congratulations, asshole,
you just made us all famous.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.874
When they come for us,
you're gonna die first.

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:49.877
Get away from me.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:53.380
- You understand?
- Get away from me.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:11.357
<i>Sir, we have facial recognition
coming up right now.</i>

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:15.069
Carl Killick.
This guy's a right-wing sociopath.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.572
First arrested at age 12.
Tried to blow up his local post office...

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:21.158
...because they employed
too many African-Americans.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:22.910
Last seen with Conrad Cern.

01:09:23.077 --> 01:09:24.578
I saw that guy at the Capitol.

01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:27.413
<i>He runs a white-power hate blog
against President Sawyer.</i>

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:30.584
- Lovely.
- Jesus. Skip Tyler.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:32.836
King of the hackers.
Worked for the NSA.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.464
Was fired for rewriting
nuclear launch coordinates...

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:37.591
...to target Apple headquarters.

01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:40.260
He was unhappy
with their music-sharing polices.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.261
Walker's been after this guy forever.

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:45.432
<i>And Emil Stenz. Ex-Delta Force.</i>

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:46.934
<i>Highly decorated.</i>

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.602
I'm afraid we know this guy too.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:50.938
- How?
- Unfortunately, that's classified.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:54.358
Well, I hereby declassify it.
Now, you wanna share it with the group?

01:09:54.525 --> 01:09:57.111
Stenz did off-the-books wetwork
for us in Pakistan...

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:59.113
<i>was part of a black-bag
CIA operation.</i>

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:02.241
<i>When the Sawyer administration
came in, the new secretary of defence...</i>

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.868
...shut down the operation
and disavowed its assets...

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.371
...including Stenz.
His identity was compromised.

01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:10.457
He wound up spending two years
in a Taliban-controlled prison.

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:13.127
- No wonder he's pissed at us.
- It's the threat matrix.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.421
Every day the Secret Service
does a rundown...

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:18.841
...of threats against the president.
Every one of these guys was on it.

01:10:19.007 --> 01:10:21.301
It's like Walker used
it as a shopping list.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.303
Sir, Delta Force is 15 minutes out.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:27.307
<i>All right, general. I want them prepped
for an attack on the White House...</i>

01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:29.935
<i>- ...as soon as I give the word.</i>
- Sir, please! Please.

01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:31.937
Only the president can give that order.

01:10:32.104 --> 01:10:34.481
<i>The president is behind enemy lines
and compromised.</i>

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:38.527
<i>I'm calling the Cabinet together
to invoke the 25th.</i>

01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:40.320
<i>Gel' behind this, Eli.</i>

01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:43.073
<i>What if this were even a coup d'état?</i>

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.700
<i>Come on, that's just nonsense.</i>

01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:47.077
<i>Why isn't the military doing anything?</i>

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.997
<i>You gotta understand,
this is a very difficult situation...</i>

01:10:50.164 --> 01:10:53.917
<i>...for the Pentagon, there are hostages.
You can't bring the big guns out...</i>

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.045
<i>...because there's a class
of little schoolgirls still inside.</i>

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:14.480
- Martin!
- Good morning, boys.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.023
Move, move!

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:19.651
Come on, go, go, go!

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:23.697
- They're in the ground-floor kitchen.
- That's it.

01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:25.783
Come on, go, go, go!
Where's the basement?

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.659
Through here. To the left.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.347
- Shit!
- They're gone.

01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:50.057
Goddamn it!

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:54.937
- I have the president and Cale calling.
- Cale, give me your location.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:58.398
All right, we're in the basement.
There's a gate with a keypad.

01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:01.985
Okay, the code is 64762.

01:12:04.071 --> 01:12:05.197
All right, we're in.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:08.742
Go down the hallway. That should be
the entrance to the catacombs.

01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:10.661
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:15.624
You should then be in a big oval room.
There'll be five tunnels.

01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:18.210
Take the second tunnel,
follow it all the way out...

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:21.046
- ...and we'll be waiting.
- We found it. Mr. President...

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:22.381
...take this.

01:12:22.548 --> 01:12:24.424
- I can't go.
- What are you talking about?

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:26.927
- I'm not leaving my little girl.
- Then I'm staying.

01:12:27.094 --> 01:12:29.179
You gotta go back
to being president, sir.

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:32.558
- Otherwise, all this is for nothing.
- You can't do this by yourself.

01:12:32.724 --> 01:12:37.271
You're gonna go and send the Marines
in here to get us, okay? Promise me.

01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:38.772
All right.

01:12:40.107 --> 01:12:42.234
You got my word. Thanks, John.

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:43.443
All right.

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:50.742
See you outside.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.634
They are in the basement.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:10.929
All right, everyone in the basement!
The basement!

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:14.474
Cale, come check this out.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.895
Okay, please don't touch my toys.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:22.149
That's something
that we do not wanna touch.

01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:23.483
Carol, we got a problem.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:26.570
The exit tunnel's wired with explosives.
We need another exit.

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:28.238
There isn't another exit.

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:30.657
It's locked!

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:33.994
- Tyler, I need the gate code.
- I have that right here.

01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:35.495
Here's your gate code.

01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:37.456
This is not happening.
We gotta move.

01:13:37.623 --> 01:13:39.625
- Carol, where are we going?
- Hold on.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.209
I can't hold on.

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.839
We need a location right now!

01:13:46.882 --> 01:13:49.468
Stagecoach. Follow me.
Let's get to the Stagecoach.

01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:51.178
No, no, no, you'll be trapped.

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:55.849
This is a bad idea.
They grounded all aircraft.

01:13:56.016 --> 01:13:59.311
This is Jack Freeman reporting live
from the skies over Washington, D.C.

01:13:59.478 --> 01:14:03.607
We're bringing you exclusive images
of the terrorist-held White House.

01:14:03.774 --> 01:14:05.192
Clear left.

01:14:09.738 --> 01:14:12.783
Cabinet is assembling with
the vice president to invoke the 25th.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:15.619
<i>Cale, if you don't get him out
in the next five minutes...</i>

01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:19.539
<i>- ...he might not be president anymore.</i>
- You didn't give me the job, remember?

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.459
What's the code to D227?

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:24.878
What's the code for D227?

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:26.296
Hold on.

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:28.507
Fast! Go, go, go! Go, go!

01:14:31.343 --> 01:14:32.552
13350.

01:14:36.807 --> 01:14:38.183
We're in, let's go!

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.519
- Go, I'll cover you!
- All right, all right!

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.066
This way, Cale. The keys.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:54.199
Got them!

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:58.412
What the hell
are you getting in the back for?

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.913
Sorry, force of habit.

01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:14.636
Damn it! Keys! Let's go! Let's go!

01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:20.726
- I'm crashing the gate.
- No, no, no!

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:24.438
It's 8 feet tall and dual-hardened steel.
We're not gonna make it. Left!

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.068
- Where's the garage clicker?
- You kidding? I don't have a clicker.

01:15:30.235 --> 01:15:31.778
Suburban!

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:36.241
I think I'm seeing the presidential limo
driving across the grounds.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:41.246
We're gonna out them off!
Hang on, Motts!

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:43.415
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:45.959
Cale, they're in heavy weapons
follow-up.

01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:47.919
What do you mean, "heavy weapon"?

01:15:49.588 --> 01:15:51.214
You gotta be kidding me right now!

01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:54.968
Move!

01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.682
Oh, my goodness!
The presidential limo...

01:16:00.849 --> 01:16:03.769
...has just burst onto the South Lawn!

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.981
- So sorry.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet...

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:10.901
- ...it's with a heavy heart...
- Sir, you have to see this!

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:14.321
<i>It's trying to make its way
around the South Lawn fountain.</i>

01:16:14.488 --> 01:16:16.782
<i>That iconic fountain
that everybody knows...</i>

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:19.284
<i>...anyone who's ever been
to the White House knows.</i>

01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:21.787
Box them in! Go for the window, Motts!

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:28.168
Tanks. We got tanks.
Let's put them to use.

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:31.171
I think that's my dad.

01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:33.590
I'm not sure using heavy artillery
is a wise...

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:35.926
I don't give a damn. You get that tank...

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:38.678
- ...you put a hole in the goddamn fence!
- Yeah! Come on!

01:16:39.471 --> 01:16:41.723
Look, look, look!
Watch him, watch him, watch him.

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:43.934
Go for the windshield! Go!

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:51.024
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
- Get your head down.

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:07.707
- Yeah, that's one down.
- Shit!

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.709
- Commander, are you in position?
- Roger.

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:12.671
- Then go to work.
- Fall back! Fall back!

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.215
Driver, advance!

01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:19.010
We don't know what is happening exactly,
but the National Guard is in fact...

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:21.388
...enacting some sort of manoeuvre.
It depends...

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:25.475
RPG'S! Now!

01:17:27.978 --> 01:17:30.063
Blow these bastards off the roof.

01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:35.360
- Take cover!
- Fire!

01:17:45.537 --> 01:17:46.872
Incoming!

01:17:52.586 --> 01:17:53.753
Commander, come in!

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:00.260
- Goddamn it!
- Shit.

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:03.722
Good job, boys! Great job, Mulcahy!

01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:07.767
<i>This is an unprecedented situation.
We have a full-scale war going on...</i>

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:09.477
<i>...on the White House grounds.</i>

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:12.189
Mulcahy! Take out the limo!
Let's go! Take the limo!

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:15.984
<i>What are you waiting on? Take it out!</i>

01:18:16.568 --> 01:18:18.069
<i>They're firing.</i>

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:22.616
- I can't see. What am I supposed to do?
- I need him alive!

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:24.576
<i>- That's an order!</i>
- Why don't you shut up?

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.995
There's a camera system
here in the car. There.

01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:30.290
- What am I doing with zombies?
- It's my daughter's favourite movie.

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:32.292
Watch out, watch out! Left!

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:37.631
We gotta punch a hole in this fence soon
or we're dead in the water.

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:40.759
There's a weapons locker in the back.

01:18:41.009 --> 01:18:43.553
- Jackpot!
- What you got?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.971
That's what I'm talking about!

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:47.974
That thing in your right hand is
a blast shield. Perfect.

01:18:49.309 --> 01:18:52.646
Can you not hit me in the head
with a rocket while I'm trying to drive?!

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.314
Get me to the fence, Cale!

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:59.194
- Stick that thing out there, go to work.
- Damn right.

01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:01.821
Hold it with two hands, Mr. President.

01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:03.740
Oh, my God, that's President Sawyer.

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:06.117
<i>- He has a rocket launcher.</i>
- There's something...

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:07.994
...you don't see every day.

01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:09.496
Here it comes!

01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:18.964
- I lost the rocket launcher.
- How do you lose a rocket launcher?

01:19:20.006 --> 01:19:23.969
<i>Killick, take one of the hostages outside.
Show them we mean business.</i>

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:25.637
<i>This just in from China.</i>

01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:27.973
<i>- -destroyed the West Gate
of the White House.</i>

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:32.018
- We got our exit.
- One more time around the fountain.

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:33.853
- No!
- Get over here.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.731
<i>One of the terrorists
is holding a little girl at gunpoint.</i>

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.442
- What'd he say?
<i>- Emily Cale is being held...</i>

01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:42.779
<i>...at the White House balcony right now
by the terrorists.</i>

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:47.200
<i>She was the one who managed to send
this video out so the world could see...</i>

01:19:47.784 --> 01:19:49.661
<i>- Another rocket.</i>
- Cale!

01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:52.872
Dad!

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.463
<i>I can't see what is going on...</i>

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.507
Get me a location on them now!

01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:04.759
...The West Wing. The president has...

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:07.095
We're not sure if he's alive
or dead right now.

01:20:07.262 --> 01:20:09.389
- The limousine has disappeared...
- Emily?

01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:11.266
<i>...The West Wing. I can't see him...</i>

01:20:11.433 --> 01:20:13.059
Killick, take her back inside.

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:16.062
- Dad!
- Get over here!

01:20:19.941 --> 01:20:21.985
Shit. What the...?

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.078
- Something wrong with your radio?
- Malfunctioned.

01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:35.081
Stay behind me. They won't shoot us.
They need me alive.

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:36.875
- Put a gun to my head.
- What?

01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:39.252
That concludes
the running-and-shooting portion.

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:41.129
Stay back or I'll shoot him!

01:20:41.296 --> 01:20:45.008
Appreciate what you're trying to do, son.
Did the same job myself, and proudly.

01:20:45.175 --> 01:20:48.345
I have no quarrel with you,
but I do have a deadline.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:49.721
So put the gun down...

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:50.930
Pull the pin.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:53.391
...because you're not
gonna shoot the president.

01:20:53.558 --> 01:20:55.769
- You're right.
- Where does that leave us, boys?

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:58.271
That leaves us with this.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:01.399
Come on!

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:02.776
Go, go, go!

01:21:10.033 --> 01:21:11.785
What are you doing?!

01:21:16.164 --> 01:21:17.207
Oh, no. Come on, go!

01:21:17.374 --> 01:21:19.626
This way! Follow me! Follow me!

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:28.301
Enormous explosion
over toward the West Wing.

01:21:28.468 --> 01:21:31.805
<i>I don't know if this means the president
has been killed. We know...</i>

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.891
I got 100 people in here!
Somebody tell me something!

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:39.896
- You idiot.
- What'd you say?

01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:42.482
You are an idiot.

01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:44.317
You just blew our whole mission.

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:45.985
- Your mission.
- Shut up.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:06.297
Mr. Stenz, this may be your lucky day.
Get your men back to the basement.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:12.178
I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute...

01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:14.639
...the office of president
of the United States...

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:18.810
...and will to the best of my ability
preserve, protect and defend...

01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:22.814
...the Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:25.817
Sir, follow me, please.

01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:37.912
Place your hand there
for scanning, please.

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:43.084
Sir, these are your presidential
launch codes.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:45.086
Keep them on your person
at all times.

01:22:45.253 --> 01:22:48.298
<i>Vice President Alvin Hammond
has just been sworn in...</i>

01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:51.301
<i>...as the 47th president
of the United States...</i>

01:22:51.468 --> 01:22:54.804
<i>...confirming, of course,
the worst possible scenario...</i>

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:57.724
<i>...the death of President James Sawyer.</i>

01:22:57.891 --> 01:23:00.560
<i>People all over the globe
have been holding their breath.</i>

01:23:00.727 --> 01:23:04.230
<i>They're wondering what is happening
right here in America.</i>

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:07.859
<i>After all, the United States has the
biggest weapons arsenal in the world.</i>

01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:11.779
We need to start moving the money.
Maybe buy some time.

01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:16.618
<i>- -Will he be able to get this extremely
volatile situation under control.</i>

01:23:16.784 --> 01:23:18.328
Muriel Walker's here.

01:23:18.495 --> 01:23:21.456
<i>Thousands are gathering,
leaving candles and flowers...</i>

01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:23.750
<i>...at the doors of the U.S...</i>

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:25.210
We've got movement.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.297
We've got movement
at the Federal Reserve.

01:23:29.464 --> 01:23:32.258
<i>Stenz, do you hear me?
Confirming they're loading the money.</i>

01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:34.260
<i>Let's wrap this up.</i>

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:37.263
Stenz, we're wasting our time here.

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:39.933
Walker, are you sure
they're down here?

01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:43.978
<i>Did I spend 15 goddamn years
running this place or did you?!</i>

01:23:44.145 --> 01:23:45.688
This guy is losing it.

01:23:46.523 --> 01:23:48.483
What do we care if he gets the president?

01:23:48.650 --> 01:23:49.901
We made a deal.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.614
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.

01:23:54.781 --> 01:23:56.366
Walker has cancer.

01:23:56.533 --> 01:23:58.576
His doctors gave him
less than three months.

01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:01.454
He has a golf-ball-sized tumour
on his frontal lobe.

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:02.872
Jesus Christ.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:05.458
I think he's on a suicide mission.

01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:08.169
- You ready?
- Yes.

01:24:08.336 --> 01:24:11.339
- What do you think you're doing?
- If anybody can talk him down...

01:24:11.506 --> 01:24:12.799
...it's her, trust me.

01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:18.638
A little birdie told me
you're finally moving the money.

01:24:18.805 --> 01:24:20.306
<i>Martin?</i>

01:24:26.354 --> 01:24:29.315
<i>I had to tell them
about the tumour, Martin.</i>

01:24:32.694 --> 01:24:33.987
That's all right.

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.323
<i>Please stop this.</i>

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:40.743
Please just come home.

01:24:43.955 --> 01:24:45.999
I have to do this, honey.

01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:47.750
No, you don't.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:51.129
They have to pay
for what they did to Kevin.

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:53.256
<i>And when it's over...</i>

01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:56.467
...I promise...

01:24:58.261 --> 01:24:59.596
I promise you'll understand.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.607
You're doing this for Kevin?

01:25:11.482 --> 01:25:13.192
I swear to God.

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.743
Then you do whatever it takes.

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:25.371
You make them pay
for what they did to our boy.

01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:27.332
What the hell are you doing?

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:30.043
<i>Walker, you stop this...</i>

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:33.671
...or I'll make sure she spends
the rest of her life in a federal prison.

01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:35.506
You have 19 minutes.

01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.346
You're done.

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:43.514
- General.
- Your boss took the White House...

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:45.892
...and your man inside
got the president killed.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.895
- Carol, calm down.
- You're free to go.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:54.525
Thank God for Gerald Ford.

01:25:54.692 --> 01:25:55.777
Why?

01:25:55.943 --> 01:25:59.572
He built this because he didn't want
the press to see him in his swim trunks.

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:03.368
- Any chance this leads out of here?
- No. Listen, I gotta stop for a second.

01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:05.745
What? You all right?

01:26:06.329 --> 01:26:07.997
That's not good, is it?

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:10.083
- Stenz worked for the CIA, right?
- Right.

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:13.294
If we can track the way
that Walker contacted...

01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:15.755
...these guys,
we can figure out how to stop them.

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:18.675
- How do you propose we do that?
- Keep an eye on Caulfield.

01:26:19.926 --> 01:26:21.094
Wait, what?

01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:25.014
Hi. I'm Carol.

01:26:26.683 --> 01:26:28.601
I'm not supposed to talk to you
right now.

01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:31.562
Run a database search
on the guys in that building.

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:34.107
CIA, NSA, everything you've got.

01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:40.488
Okay, listen, Walker's not doing
this for the money, trust me.

01:26:40.655 --> 01:26:43.574
- There is something else going on.
- I can't do that, ma'am.

01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:46.786
On the worst day that our country
has ever had...

01:26:46.953 --> 01:26:49.539
...you could be the key
to figuring all of this out.

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:55.753
<i>...could otherwise not accomplish that
is take back the White House.</i>

01:26:59.549 --> 01:27:01.008
I'm gonna have to get that out.

01:27:01.175 --> 01:27:03.261
When did you become a doctor
all of a sudden?

01:27:03.428 --> 01:27:06.848
Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it.
Talk to me about your daughter.

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:09.267
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:13.229
- She even tried to get me to vote for you.
- You didn't vote for me?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.650
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.

01:27:17.984 --> 01:27:20.778
She was like 3 when I enlisted.

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:22.822
And to be honest with you...

01:27:22.989 --> 01:27:25.658
...I was probably just running
from my marriage.

01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:28.119
Right after I deployed,
Emily was watching TV...

01:27:28.286 --> 01:27:31.164
...and there was coverage on
the troops in Afghanistan.

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:34.500
She swears to me that she saw me.

01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:37.754
After that point,
she became obsessed with politics.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.173
And that's when she first saw you.

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:43.009
The man that was gonna
bring Daddy home.

01:27:43.176 --> 01:27:47.096
And when I finally did come home,
I realised that...

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.768
...I'm not her hero anymore.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:56.522
So I guess I just figured that I'd try
to help protect the man that is.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:28:00.151
Well, if she saw you today, Cale,
she'd be proud of you.

01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:03.362
You know how when they're young
and they come running up to you...

01:28:03.529 --> 01:28:05.865
...and they hug you
and they're shouting "Daddy"...

01:28:06.032 --> 01:28:10.036
...and all of a sudden, one day,
that just stops?

01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:11.329
Yeah.

01:28:11.496 --> 01:28:13.831
I'd give anything for that hug
just one more time.

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:17.460
You know, my daughter,
she's 15 years old, her name is Amber.

01:28:17.627 --> 01:28:20.505
You know what she wants
for her birthday?

01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:23.549
- A belly button ring.
- Belly button ring.

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:26.719
- What parent is equipped for that?
- Daughters.

01:28:30.223 --> 01:28:33.351
- What's happening?
<i>- Attention, attention.</i>

01:28:33.518 --> 01:28:38.231
<i>Everyone below Calico T-11,
please clear the floor immediately.</i>

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:40.233
Put the president on-screen.

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:44.111
Mr. President, Delta Force entered
Washington airspace.

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:46.405
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron
on the line.

01:28:48.616 --> 01:28:50.952
You're online, sir!

01:28:51.536 --> 01:28:53.079
<i>What do you have for us, colonel?</i>

01:28:53.246 --> 01:28:56.040
We developed this plan
independent of the Secret Service.

01:28:56.207 --> 01:28:58.918
<i>We'll use the superstructure
of the city to mask our approach.</i>

01:28:59.085 --> 01:29:01.045
What if they start killing hostages?

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:02.839
<i>They're dead anyway if this fails.</i>

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:05.007
Alvin, please think about
what you're doing.

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:08.761
<i>May I remind you that you are addressing
the president of the United States?</i>

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:11.889
<i>Mr. President, I don't wanna write off
any Americans yet.</i>

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:14.433
<i>Trust me, sir,
we'll get your house back for you.</i>

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.602
<i>- Mission's a go, colonel.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:23.234
You heard the president.
Flight time to target: six minutes.

01:29:23.776 --> 01:29:26.654
- So, what's it like being president?
- It's not like anything.

01:29:26.821 --> 01:29:29.782
Once you get into office,
it's all about re-election...

01:29:29.949 --> 01:29:32.076
...and what the other side
can use against you.

01:29:32.243 --> 01:29:35.538
- Politics.
- You don't start out a politician...

01:29:35.705 --> 01:29:36.789
...but you become one.

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:39.792
Just once, though,
I wanna do something that's presidential.

01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:43.004
Something along the lines of Lincoln,
Washington and Jefferson.

01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:46.299
- You wanna make history.
- No. Not history.

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:48.009
I wanna make a difference.

01:29:48.175 --> 01:29:50.928
If your little daughter
says that I'm her hero...

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:52.847
...then I gotta earn that.

01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:03.316
All right, we go in low and quiet.
Time to target is two minutes.

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:15.328
- Falcon 2, maintain 3-0 feet.
- Falcon 1, copy, 3-0 feet.

01:30:35.139 --> 01:30:38.684
- Drop to 1-0 feet!
- Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.

01:30:41.312 --> 01:30:45.191
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C.
There's total gridlock through...

01:30:45.358 --> 01:30:48.653
Oh, my God! U.S. Special Forces
are flying over us!

01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:02.959
Shit. Sir, we have
Black Hawks coming in.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.378
- Which direction?
- From I Street, and fast.

01:31:08.214 --> 01:31:11.717
- How do you feel, Mr. President?
- Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale.

01:31:13.386 --> 01:31:17.306
Let me call in, make sure
they don't think we're dead.

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.475
<i>The former vice president,
Alvin Hammond...</i>

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:22.520
<i>...is clearly calling the shots
as the new commander in chief.</i>

01:31:22.687 --> 01:31:24.522
- I have John Cale on the line.
- Cale?

01:31:24.689 --> 01:31:27.274
- Where's Carol?
- Finnerty's been relieved of command.

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:31.153
The cavalry's coming. Should be hitting
the residence in a few minutes.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.739
No, no, no, not by air.
They have to come by ground.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:36.575
- I think we can handle this.
- They have Javelin missiles.

01:31:36.742 --> 01:31:38.119
Not according to our intel.

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:41.372
Even if we wanted to call them back,
they've gone dark.

01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:44.875
If they fail, they're going to kill
every single one of those hostages...

01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:47.086
- ...including my daughter.
- Just go.

01:31:47.253 --> 01:31:49.463
Take this and stay out of sight.

01:31:56.595 --> 01:31:58.889
- Thirty seconds!
- Let's go!

01:31:59.056 --> 01:32:01.267
Incoming, three of them!
Spread out!

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:07.231
<i>Castle in sight.
I say again, Castle in sight.</i>

01:32:07.398 --> 01:32:11.402
- Are you ready?
- Colonel, we got movement on the roof.

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:13.696
They've got missile lock!
Evasive manoeuvres!

01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:16.115
<i>Break right! Javelins! Javelins!</i>

01:32:16.282 --> 01:32:17.950
<i>Shit!</i>

01:32:18.117 --> 01:32:20.745
- Break right!
- I can't hold out! We're going down!

01:32:20.953 --> 01:32:23.622
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Shit.

01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:27.793
Get down! Incoming!

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.128
<i>We're going down!</i>

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:37.094
<i>One is closing in on the White House.</i>

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:40.973
<i>Looks like it's checking on
the conditions of the hostages.</i>

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:47.146
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot the hostages?

01:32:47.313 --> 01:32:50.816
Get on the 50-cal! Mulcahy, let's go!

01:32:51.484 --> 01:32:52.818
<i>Hammer down! Hammer down!</i>

01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:56.781
Fire!

01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:02.661
Pull up! Pull up!

01:33:06.457 --> 01:33:07.708
Yeah!

01:33:16.383 --> 01:33:17.718
Last mag.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:20.513
They've got missile lock!

01:33:27.978 --> 01:33:29.021
<i>Movement on the roof.</i>

01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:44.995
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I think that man is a friendly!

01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:55.131
Get ready to deploy!

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.384
- Fast-rope down!
- Go, go!

01:34:01.262 --> 01:34:03.514
<i>- Get us out! Missile!
- Javelin up! Javelin up!</i>

01:34:03.681 --> 01:34:04.765
Countermeasures!

01:34:04.932 --> 01:34:06.058
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:23.242
No.

01:34:33.043 --> 01:34:35.045
<i>This mission is going terribly wrong.</i>

01:34:35.212 --> 01:34:37.923
<i>I can see now that there
are two men on top of the roof...</i>

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.259
<i>...and they're engaged
in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

01:35:55.292 --> 01:35:56.794
Shit!

01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:23.779
Yes! Skip Tyler is in!

01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:27.616
Walker, that last firewall
just came down.

01:36:27.783 --> 01:36:29.159
Mr. Tyler...

01:36:30.536 --> 01:36:32.371
...we are a go, sir.

01:36:33.747 --> 01:36:35.582
God bless us all.

01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:05.029
Sir. My weapons system
is coming online.

01:37:05.696 --> 01:37:07.990
It's being accessed remotely. I can't...

01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:10.034
- Jesus Christ, it's targeting.
- What?

01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:14.621
It's firing.

01:37:20.127 --> 01:37:22.796
Target is an aircraft
somewhere over Ohio.

01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:25.799
Appears to be a modified 747.

01:37:26.592 --> 01:37:27.593
Oh, my God.

01:37:30.137 --> 01:37:32.931
<i>This is an emergency.
I repeat, this is an emergency.</i>

01:37:33.682 --> 01:37:35.267
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:37:35.434 --> 01:37:37.853
...And <i>fasten your seat belts.
I repeat, this is...</i>

01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.396
Sir, we're under attack!

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.049
<i>It's clear that someone
on the inside has orchestrated...</i>

01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:10.135
<i>...this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way...</i>

01:38:10.302 --> 01:38:14.807
Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation
of ground impact.

01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:18.102
- We're going to need to swear you in, sir.
- What?

01:38:19.812 --> 01:38:23.232
Executive power passed to the
vice president when he was sworn in...

01:38:23.399 --> 01:38:25.567
...which means the office
now passes to you.

01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:28.153
- Sir.
- Please follow these men.

01:38:39.498 --> 01:38:42.209
Sir, these are your
new presidential launch codes.

01:38:42.376 --> 01:38:44.795
Please keep them on your person
at all times.

01:38:44.962 --> 01:38:48.173
I need a moment here.
I need... I need to call my wife.

01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:49.925
Of course, sir.

01:38:50.092 --> 01:38:51.510
Thank you.

01:38:54.388 --> 01:38:56.098
Emily Cale.

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:03.105
How are you enjoying your tour?

01:39:03.272 --> 01:39:04.356
Remember these?

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:07.192
You and I have a date, sweetheart.

01:39:12.364 --> 01:39:14.700
You'll have to go through me.

01:39:14.867 --> 01:39:17.161
Really?

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:24.209
- You're gonna go to jail for that!
- And who's gonna make me?

01:39:24.376 --> 01:39:26.295
The tourist is still on the loose.

01:39:26.462 --> 01:39:30.215
But I have a hunch Daddy's
gonna come back for his little girl.

01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:33.469
- So he's still alive.
- Not for very long, he isn't.

01:39:34.678 --> 01:39:37.139
Don't screw up this time! Motts!

01:39:37.306 --> 01:39:38.765
You stay here with him.

01:39:38.932 --> 01:39:42.769
Hey! Do I look like I need a babysitter?

01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:45.397
Sit down and shut up!

01:39:57.618 --> 01:39:59.077
Oh, shit.

01:40:03.707 --> 01:40:05.751
- Mr. President.
- I...

01:40:08.921 --> 01:40:12.090
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability...

01:40:12.257 --> 01:40:14.927
...to launch missiles at any target
in the United States.

01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:17.221
Our satellites show
massive troop movements...

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:19.681
...in Russia, Pakistan
and the Arabian Peninsula.

01:40:19.848 --> 01:40:21.558
What are your orders, sir?

01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.984
I swear to you all, I swear...

01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:34.112
...that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!

01:40:36.615 --> 01:40:37.991
No.

01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:41.787
General...

01:40:43.247 --> 01:40:46.041
...how soon can you execute an air strike
on the White House?

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:47.251
Sir.

01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:49.753
We can have Raptors on target
in 10 minutes.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.464
- Then do it.
- Let's go to work!

01:40:52.631 --> 01:40:55.300
- Sir...
- Carol, we have to end this. We have to.

01:40:55.467 --> 01:40:58.929
What if the next missile that he launches
is aimed at Chicago or New York?

01:40:59.096 --> 01:41:02.599
- We're talking about millions of lives.
- Your first act as president...

01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:04.685
...is going to be bombing
the White House?

01:41:04.851 --> 01:41:06.645
Believe me, I know, I know.

01:41:06.812 --> 01:41:08.981
But our country is stronger
than one house.

01:41:09.147 --> 01:41:13.735
<i>This is Mission Control. Raptor Alpha 1,
clear to initiate Operation Free Castle.</i>

01:41:13.902 --> 01:41:16.154
Copy that, Raptor Alpha 1
beginning approach.

01:41:18.907 --> 01:41:21.827
<i>We've lost two
commanders in chief in one day.</i>

01:41:21.994 --> 01:41:25.664
<i>Look, Mark, if I'm a foreign head of state,
and the United States of America...</i>

01:41:25.831 --> 01:41:27.749
<i>...has become
a rogue nuclear power...</i>

01:41:27.916 --> 01:41:31.003
<i>...at what point do I take action
and step in...</i>

01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:33.630
<i>perhaps even with
a pre-emptive nuclear strike?</i>

01:41:36.675 --> 01:41:39.011
Brought you a present.

01:41:39.177 --> 01:41:40.804
It's the tourist's daughter.

01:41:42.222 --> 01:41:43.974
Well, hello, hello.

01:41:50.606 --> 01:41:52.816
Good morning, Mr. Cale.

01:41:52.983 --> 01:41:56.028
<i>I'm sitting here with someone
who would like to say hello to you.</i>

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:57.863
Say hello, sweetie.

01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:06.705
Say hello, sweetie.

01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:12.961
All right, then,
would you like to tell your father...

01:42:13.128 --> 01:42:16.256
...what Mr. Stenz here
is holding in his hand?

01:42:17.924 --> 01:42:20.719
<i>- A gun.</i>
- Now, Mr. Cale...

01:42:20.886 --> 01:42:22.512
...I'm gonna start counting here...

01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:27.017
...and if you don't give the president to
my men by the time I've reached three...

01:42:27.184 --> 01:42:31.772
<i>...Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot
your little girl in the stomach.</i>

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:35.901
One.

01:42:41.907 --> 01:42:43.575
<i>Two.</i>

01:42:47.287 --> 01:42:49.665
No. No. No.

01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:54.711
I'm here.

01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:58.548
Guess Daddy
doesn't love you after all.

01:43:02.511 --> 01:43:03.762
<i>We got the president.</i>

01:43:06.306 --> 01:43:09.601
- Bring him on down.
- Back to your office, sir.

01:43:15.357 --> 01:43:17.192
I have John Cale on the line, sir.

01:43:17.359 --> 01:43:18.443
<i>Cale?</i>

01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:21.071
You put her on the goddamn phone
right now.

01:43:22.072 --> 01:43:23.782
- Hi, John.
- They have the president.

01:43:23.949 --> 01:43:26.743
John, I want you to listen to me.
Help is not coming.

01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:30.455
- I said they have the president.
- They called a strike on the White House.

01:43:30.622 --> 01:43:33.125
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:36.586
They cannot do that. They still
have hostages, they still have Emily.

01:43:36.753 --> 01:43:39.381
<i>I'm so, so sorry.
I was wrong about you...</i>

01:43:39.548 --> 01:43:42.843
...but there's nothing you can do, John.
If you stay, you're gonna die.

01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:45.929
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me...

01:43:46.096 --> 01:43:48.098
...and I am not gonna disappear
on her.

01:43:48.265 --> 01:43:50.434
<i>So you tell me how much time I have.</i>

01:43:52.519 --> 01:43:55.647
You only have eight minutes left
to get them out.

01:43:55.814 --> 01:43:57.232
Goodbye, Carol.

01:44:01.319 --> 01:44:03.363
Clear out! We're moving back now!

01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:06.032
Everybody's gotta move back!
Everybody move back!

01:44:06.199 --> 01:44:08.994
What do you mean, evacuate?
My daughter is in that building!

01:44:09.995 --> 01:44:12.581
This is an emergency. Move back now!

01:44:12.748 --> 01:44:14.833
Please! Clear the area now!

01:44:17.085 --> 01:44:20.672
Move back now!
I said move back now!

01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:23.341
Okay.

01:44:26.178 --> 01:44:28.430
Oh, there I am.
That's not a bad picture.

01:44:30.682 --> 01:44:32.684
How'd they find out I did that one?

01:44:35.312 --> 01:44:36.480
Buh-bye.

01:44:37.272 --> 01:44:41.485
Whatever happened to
"the pen is mightier than the sword"?

01:44:43.695 --> 01:44:46.072
Martin, as the president
of the United States...

01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:50.494
...this comes with the full weight,
power and authority of my office:

01:44:51.036 --> 01:44:52.496
Fuck you.

01:44:56.708 --> 01:45:00.545
- You okay?
- Can we get down to business now?

01:45:01.338 --> 01:45:03.215
I'm gonna need you
to open this for me.

01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:06.134
- What is that?
- Oh, what are you doing?

01:45:06.301 --> 01:45:08.220
This is the nuclear football, sweetie.

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:13.683
It is keyed to the blood type
and heartbeat of the president.

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:16.061
- What the hell is this?
- This is the deal.

01:45:19.105 --> 01:45:21.399
There's a dozen reasons
why that's not gonna work.

01:45:21.566 --> 01:45:24.236
- Such as?
- Even if I open it, my codes are useless.

01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:27.572
They switched them out
once you took over the building.

01:45:27.739 --> 01:45:29.699
You let me worry about that.

01:45:31.034 --> 01:45:35.163
There's not a day that goes by that I don't
feel terrible about losing your boy.

01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:37.165
But that's on me.

01:45:37.332 --> 01:45:40.377
So if you want revenge,
then just shoot me.

01:45:40.544 --> 01:45:43.588
You think I blame you
for Kevin's death?

01:45:44.089 --> 01:45:46.508
Sending those men in
was the most courageous thing...

01:45:46.675 --> 01:45:48.218
...you ever did in your life.

01:45:48.385 --> 01:45:52.097
You were a true commander in chief
for five minutes.

01:45:52.264 --> 01:45:56.601
You just don't have the balls
to see the mission through.

01:45:56.768 --> 01:45:58.228
What mission?

01:45:58.395 --> 01:46:01.356
- There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
- But there will be.

01:46:02.899 --> 01:46:05.569
The Middle East is our last war.

01:46:05.735 --> 01:46:09.364
It will be us or them.

01:46:09.531 --> 01:46:13.785
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker
will be the last American soldier...

01:46:13.952 --> 01:46:16.580
...to die in that conflict in vain.

01:46:16.746 --> 01:46:18.206
You want that as your son's legacy?

01:46:18.373 --> 01:46:20.292
Murdering millions of people
in his name?

01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:24.796
Mr. President, I wish the pen
were mightier than the sword, I do.

01:46:25.338 --> 01:46:26.965
But it's just a dream.

01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:28.466
Stand up, sir.

01:46:28.633 --> 01:46:34.723
History will judge who the true patriots
were here today.

01:46:35.473 --> 01:46:40.145
I've been standing up, Martin,
and I'm not gonna open that.

01:46:50.363 --> 01:46:51.656
Martin.

01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:56.077
Martin, that's not necessary.

01:46:56.244 --> 01:46:57.329
Martin!

01:47:04.961 --> 01:47:06.671
How about now?

01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:10.800
I can't open this for him.

01:47:11.426 --> 01:47:15.430
If I do, millions of people are gonna die,
you understand that?

01:47:17.182 --> 01:47:19.100
I understand.

01:47:23.355 --> 01:47:25.440
Goddamn it!

01:47:27.484 --> 01:47:29.319
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

01:47:29.486 --> 01:47:33.239
We got thermal alarms going off
in the second-floor dining room...

01:47:33.406 --> 01:47:36.034
...the West Sitting Hall,
and the president's bedroom.

01:47:36.201 --> 01:47:39.329
Killick, he's trying to burn the place.
Second floor. Send your men.

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:52.467
Tyler? Turn off
the goddamn sprinklers!

01:47:54.094 --> 01:47:55.845
Who makes this shit?

01:48:16.241 --> 01:48:17.575
Oh, shit!

01:48:21.705 --> 01:48:22.998
What was that?

01:48:31.798 --> 01:48:33.758
I've been waiting all day to kill you.

01:48:38.346 --> 01:48:44.102
Stop hurting my White House!

01:48:45.729 --> 01:48:50.567
German mantle clock. Empire style.

01:48:51.401 --> 01:48:52.944
<i>Killick, report!</i>

01:48:53.862 --> 01:48:56.406
Killick, what the hell is happening?
Report!

01:48:56.573 --> 01:48:59.242
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?

01:48:59.409 --> 01:49:00.869
- Dad!
- She's here with me...

01:49:01.036 --> 01:49:04.622
...in the Oval Office, so why
don't you come down and get her?

01:49:04.789 --> 01:49:06.958
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you think?

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.294
Why do you make
all this shit personal?

01:49:09.461 --> 01:49:11.421
Oh, you're talking to me
about personal...

01:49:11.588 --> 01:49:14.382
...when you wanna blow up
half the world for your kid!

01:49:14.549 --> 01:49:17.469
- What are you gonna do?
- What I should've done in the beginning.

01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:19.471
- I'm gonna kill this prick.
- Hey!

01:49:19.637 --> 01:49:21.556
- What?
- You lied to all of us.

01:49:21.723 --> 01:49:23.475
This was not the job.

01:49:23.641 --> 01:49:26.102
I got business to finish. You stay here.

01:49:26.436 --> 01:49:29.856
- How do I get to the Oval Office?
- Take the stairs to the ground floor...

01:49:30.023 --> 01:49:31.983
...you go to the end
of the West Colonnade.

01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:34.486
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.

01:49:34.652 --> 01:49:35.987
Go!

01:49:36.696 --> 01:49:38.490
You heard the man!

01:49:39.449 --> 01:49:40.950
Tour's over.

01:50:02.263 --> 01:50:04.307
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.

01:50:04.474 --> 01:50:07.185
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
get the money myself.

01:50:07.352 --> 01:50:09.938
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

01:50:10.939 --> 01:50:13.942
You think I put my country
through this for money?

01:50:16.611 --> 01:50:18.613
I hate mercenaries.

01:50:23.201 --> 01:50:25.203
It's about time.

01:50:25.995 --> 01:50:27.455
I choose the pen!

01:50:30.834 --> 01:50:33.628
Come here. Get up. Up!

01:50:33.795 --> 01:50:35.338
Put your hand...

01:50:35.505 --> 01:50:36.840
<i>Weapon system unlocked.</i>

01:50:38.007 --> 01:50:40.677
<i>Enter presidential launch code.</i>

01:50:40.844 --> 01:50:44.055
Mr. President,
please wake up, wake up. Please!

01:50:48.518 --> 01:50:49.602
Sir, we're at DEFCON 1.

01:50:49.769 --> 01:50:52.063
The nuclear football
in the White House went live.

01:50:52.230 --> 01:50:53.857
- That's impossible.
- It's happening.

01:50:54.023 --> 01:50:55.900
Someone has entered
valid launch codes.

01:50:58.945 --> 01:51:01.364
- Captain on deck!
- What the hell is going on?

01:51:01.531 --> 01:51:04.868
- All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
- This can't be right.

01:51:07.078 --> 01:51:10.081
Sir, we have nuclear missiles
spinning up on the <i>Albuquerque.</i>

01:51:10.248 --> 01:51:13.835
If our allies see us launching a full-scale
nuclear strike, they will respond.

01:51:14.002 --> 01:51:16.629
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill...

01:51:16.796 --> 01:51:20.008
- ...unless you level the White House.
- Four minutes to target!

01:51:20.175 --> 01:51:23.011
I need a final go-no go
for payload delivery.

01:51:23.178 --> 01:51:24.929
God forgive me. Go.

01:51:25.096 --> 01:51:27.849
- Go!
<i>- Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle...</i>

01:51:28.016 --> 01:51:30.935
<i>- ...is a go.</i>
- Copy that. Dropping to attack altitude.

01:51:40.445 --> 01:51:43.281
Cale, Walker's trying to launch
a nuclear attack.

01:51:43.448 --> 01:51:45.366
<i>If he does, it'll start World War III.</i>

01:51:45.533 --> 01:51:47.202
<i>- You have to stop him.</i>
- What?

01:51:49.746 --> 01:51:52.290
Cale? Cale?

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.920
Head to the South Lawn!

01:51:57.086 --> 01:52:01.049
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Come on!

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.135
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:52:06.721 --> 01:52:09.390
<i>Confirm: Bandar Abbas.</i>

01:52:10.808 --> 01:52:13.394
<i>Chah Bahar targeted.</i>

01:52:13.561 --> 01:52:15.230
<i>Confirm Chah Bahar.</i>

01:52:23.529 --> 01:52:25.240
- Go! Leave, leave, leave!
- No, no!

01:52:25.406 --> 01:52:27.492
- Not without my dad!
- Go, go, go!

01:52:37.126 --> 01:52:39.587
Your little bitch says
you're gonna put me in jail!

01:52:49.305 --> 01:52:51.849
Come on, Martin. This isn't you.

01:52:52.016 --> 01:52:55.853
You protected presidents
for the past 25 years.

01:52:57.063 --> 01:52:58.856
What are you gonna do?

01:52:59.023 --> 01:53:00.525
You really gonna shoot me?

01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.445
All right.

01:53:08.992 --> 01:53:10.034
Yes.

01:53:16.541 --> 01:53:17.709
He deserved it.

01:53:18.584 --> 01:53:20.670
You killed him!

01:53:20.837 --> 01:53:22.672
Get back. Get over here.

01:53:22.839 --> 01:53:24.716
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!

01:53:24.882 --> 01:53:27.010
And do as you're told.
Go on, sit down!

01:53:36.519 --> 01:53:38.855
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!

01:53:49.741 --> 01:53:52.201
No jail for you, you little bitch!

01:53:53.077 --> 01:53:54.912
No! No!

01:53:57.749 --> 01:53:59.334
Get it off!

01:54:03.046 --> 01:54:06.758
<i>There was an enormous explosion
in the vicinity of the West Wing.</i>

01:54:06.924 --> 01:54:09.552
<i>A huge ball of flames
has burst into the sky.</i>

01:54:09.719 --> 01:54:12.930
<i>- It's got to be more than 100 feet...
Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

01:54:13.097 --> 01:54:15.600
Delta 2-6, copy that.
Two minutes to target.

01:54:20.897 --> 01:54:22.690
- Clear the area.
- Get back in there!

01:54:22.857 --> 01:54:25.735
The Department of Homeland Security...

01:54:26.944 --> 01:54:28.321
Get in there!

01:54:28.488 --> 01:54:31.366
This is a mandatory evacuation...

01:54:37.622 --> 01:54:39.165
Emily.

01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:43.127
No, please, please, baby.
Look at me. I'm right here.

01:54:43.294 --> 01:54:47.715
<i>Tabriz targeted. Confirm Tabriz.</i>

01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:51.219
Please, baby, you gotta
turn around and look at me.

01:54:51.386 --> 01:54:53.388
Damn it.

01:54:53.554 --> 01:54:57.392
Evacuate this area immediately!
We need you to move back, people!

01:54:57.558 --> 01:54:58.976
- Move back now!
- Emily!

01:54:59.143 --> 01:55:01.270
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!

01:55:01.437 --> 01:55:04.857
- My daughter was in there. Emily Cale.
- She's still in there. Wait!

01:55:05.024 --> 01:55:08.319
- Emily!
- What is with this family? Wait for me!

01:55:08.486 --> 01:55:11.322
<i>Confirm Tehran.</i>

01:55:11.489 --> 01:55:13.991
<i>Targeting complete.</i>

01:55:14.158 --> 01:55:16.285
<i>Armed for nuclear launch.</i>

01:55:16.452 --> 01:55:19.664
<i>You have 15 seconds to initiate.</i>

01:55:19.831 --> 01:55:22.417
<i>Fifteen, 14...</i>

- Dad, in his hand!
<i>- ...four...</i>

01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.850
<i>- ...three...</i>

01:55:39.016 --> 01:55:40.143
<i>- ...two...</i>

01:55:40.309 --> 01:55:41.769

<i>Confirmation timed out.</i>

01:55:51.279 --> 01:55:54.449
Delta 2-6, one minute to target.
Go weapons hot.

01:55:55.074 --> 01:55:56.909
- Thank God, Em.
- Daddy, I love you.

01:55:57.076 --> 01:55:58.161
You're okay.

01:55:58.327 --> 01:56:01.205
- I love you so much.
- The president. He shot him!

01:56:01.372 --> 01:56:02.874
He shot him in there.

01:56:04.667 --> 01:56:06.335
Look, I need you to listen to me.

01:56:06.502 --> 01:56:08.713
There's an air strike coming,
I need you to run.

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.632
I need you to run as far and as fast
as you can possibly go.

01:56:11.799 --> 01:56:13.759
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.

01:56:13.926 --> 01:56:16.179
- Okay.
- You gotta go for me. Now, go.

01:56:16.345 --> 01:56:19.140
<i>Hundreds of people seem to be
running toward the White House.</i>

01:56:19.307 --> 01:56:23.394
<i>They've been told to evacuate too,
but they're climbing the fence.</i>

01:56:23.561 --> 01:56:27.899
<i>Okay, we have confirmation. President
Raphelson has ordered an air strike...</i>

01:56:28.065 --> 01:56:31.402
<i>...on the White House,

01:56:31.569 --> 01:56:33.237
<i>I... I have to go. I'm sorry.</i>

01:56:33.404 --> 01:56:36.073
<i>Delta 2-6, requesting permission

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:37.825
<i>Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

<i>All right, guys, let's clean it up.</i>

01:56:41.662 --> 01:56:45.750

<i>Raptor Alpha 1, clear.
Mission is a go.</i>

01:56:51.547 --> 01:56:54.258
Delta 2-6, we have friendlies

01:56:54.425 --> 01:56:58.429
<i>I cannot see the planes, but what
I can see is an unbelievable sight.</i>

<i>Emily Cale is out on the lawn,
and she's waving the presidential flag.</i>

01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:04.602
No, baby. No, I told you to run!
You gotta run!

01:57:04.769 --> 01:57:07.980
Captain, do you see this? Delta 2-6,
we have a young girl on the lawn.

01:57:08.147 --> 01:57:10.358
I think she's trying to wave off
the air strike.

01:57:10.525 --> 01:57:13.319
<i>- Sir, requesting permission to abort.</i>
- Mr. President, please.

01:57:13.486 --> 01:57:16.030
Sir! Sir! I need an answer.

01:57:16.197 --> 01:57:20.785
I'm not doing this, guys. Abort mission.
Pull out! Abort! Abort! Abort!

<i>This is an unprecedented moment

01:57:58.406 --> 01:58:00.491
That search you requested
came back.

01:58:04.537 --> 01:58:08.583
<i>Emily, can you believe how many people
have seen your video blog?</i>

01:58:08.749 --> 01:58:11.127
<i>It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.</i>

01:58:11.294 --> 01:58:14.422
<i>- How many?
- Seven hundred million people.</i>

01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:16.257
Daughters.

01:58:16.424 --> 01:58:17.675
Jesus!

01:58:18.259 --> 01:58:20.094
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:58:21.762 --> 01:58:24.432
Honest Abe. My wife got this for me.

01:58:24.599 --> 01:58:26.475
For the inauguration.

01:58:30.146 --> 01:58:32.273
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa...?

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.111
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe
took a second bullet for me.

01:58:41.657 --> 01:58:43.200
Thank you.

01:58:44.035 --> 01:58:46.329
Thank you for what you did for Emily.

01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:48.372
It's my sacrifice, right?

01:58:49.707 --> 01:58:50.875
Yes, sir.

01:58:56.881 --> 01:58:57.923
Yep.

01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:00.259
John, listen.

01:59:00.426 --> 01:59:01.719
This isn't over yet.

01:59:01.886 --> 01:59:03.471
<i>Walker had no prior contact...</i>

01:59:03.638 --> 01:59:06.223
<i>with any of the terrorists,
but someone else did.</i>

01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.268
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

01:59:09.435 --> 01:59:11.771
- The president's with me.
<i>- This guy, Stenz...</i>

01:59:11.937 --> 01:59:14.148
<i>...made multiple calls
to a secure line in D.C...</i>

01:59:14.315 --> 01:59:18.194
<i>...but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.</i>

01:59:18.361 --> 01:59:20.571
<i>Really? Did you check Walker's
personal records?</i>

01:59:20.738 --> 01:59:23.074
<i>His computer, his e-mails?</i>

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.368
<i>You don't know Walker, John.
He was a dinosaur.</i>

01:59:25.534 --> 01:59:27.995
<i>The man still used a pager.</i>

01:59:28.579 --> 01:59:29.955
Oh, shit.

01:59:32.958 --> 01:59:35.586
Listen. Carol,
I got to check something out.

01:59:35.753 --> 01:59:37.213
We'll see you outside.

01:59:40.591 --> 01:59:42.093
I don't believe it.

01:59:42.259 --> 01:59:47.056
I think I know how Walker got the codes,
but I'm gonna need your help, sir.

01:59:53.354 --> 01:59:55.272
Move back! Move back.

01:59:55.439 --> 01:59:56.607
Emily.

01:59:58.609 --> 02:00:02.363
Oh, baby, you okay?
Oh, thank God.

02:00:02.530 --> 02:00:04.115
Thank God, baby.

02:00:10.996 --> 02:00:14.125
- Did you see my routine?
- Yeah.

02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:19.130
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
You were beautiful, baby.

02:00:19.296 --> 02:00:22.133
You saved us. You know that?

02:00:24.427 --> 02:00:27.722
Hey, stay with Mommy for a second,
okay? I'll be right back.

02:00:30.891 --> 02:00:33.561
- John.
- It's disarmed.

02:00:33.728 --> 02:00:36.272
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?

02:00:38.816 --> 02:00:39.984
He didn't make it, sir.

02:00:46.198 --> 02:00:48.409
I need to address the nation.

02:00:48.576 --> 02:00:50.828
General, get on with the Joint Chiefs.

02:00:50.995 --> 02:00:54.498
We need to move our troops into
the Middle East to stabilise the region.

02:00:54.665 --> 02:00:56.250
You wanna move troops in?

02:00:56.417 --> 02:00:59.295
When they find out that we almost
launched a nuclear attack...

02:00:59.462 --> 02:01:01.839
...there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.

02:01:02.006 --> 02:01:05.134
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course. Yeah.

02:01:05.301 --> 02:01:07.553
When did you and Walker
cook this whole thing up?

02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:08.846
- Excuse me?
- How'd it go?

02:01:09.013 --> 02:01:11.682
You gave Walker the launch codes
and he made you president?

02:01:13.058 --> 02:01:14.143
You can prove this?

02:01:17.021 --> 02:01:20.024
Well, Walker had to get the launch codes
from somewhere...

02:01:20.191 --> 02:01:22.485
...and you were the only person
with those codes.

02:01:23.194 --> 02:01:25.196
And I found this pager
in Walker's pocket.

02:01:25.362 --> 02:01:27.948
I only know one other person
that uses one of these.

02:01:29.742 --> 02:01:31.619
That doesn't prove anything.

02:01:31.786 --> 02:01:34.163
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?

02:01:35.498 --> 02:01:39.001
Why don't you call the return number
on that, Carol?

02:01:42.588 --> 02:01:45.382
Would have been better
if the evidence had been destroyed...

02:01:45.549 --> 02:01:47.384
...in the air strike that you ordered.

02:01:54.225 --> 02:01:55.810
You're a goddamn traitor, sir.

02:01:58.896 --> 02:02:00.523
You dim little shit.

02:02:00.689 --> 02:02:03.734
I hired you out of pity
and this is how you repay me.

02:02:03.901 --> 02:02:06.987
Tomorrow, when people find out
that your precious president...

02:02:07.154 --> 02:02:09.573
...helped a maniac
open the nuclear football...

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:12.409
...who do you think they're
going to believe, you or me?

02:02:12.576 --> 02:02:14.703
You, you would be a nobody.

02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:17.915
But me, I'm the president
of the United States.

02:02:18.082 --> 02:02:19.542
No, you're not.

02:02:20.918 --> 02:02:22.920
Eli, Eli.

02:02:23.087 --> 02:02:24.922
Quite the politician, huh?

02:02:25.089 --> 02:02:28.843
You did all of this just to keep your
buddies in the defence industry happy.

02:02:29.009 --> 02:02:30.886
How far did you fall into their pockets?

02:02:31.053 --> 02:02:32.388
This is ridiculous.

02:02:32.555 --> 02:02:35.224
- Take him into custody, general.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

02:02:35.391 --> 02:02:37.601
No, I'm still president.
I am still president.

02:02:37.768 --> 02:02:40.855
Well, just consider this a coup d'état.
Get this trash off my lawn.

02:02:41.021 --> 02:02:43.691
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!

02:02:43.858 --> 02:02:45.943
You're selling this country
out to the Arabs.

02:02:46.110 --> 02:02:47.570
This isn't over. I got friends.

02:02:47.736 --> 02:02:50.573
And I'll make sure all of your friends
meet you in prison.

02:02:51.282 --> 02:02:52.908
Let's get him to the hospital.

02:02:55.369 --> 02:02:58.289
You okay? You look terrible.

02:02:59.331 --> 02:03:01.625
Thank you for everything
you did today.

02:03:03.294 --> 02:03:04.628
Thank you for trusting me.

02:03:04.795 --> 02:03:06.297
Special Agent Cale!

02:03:06.463 --> 02:03:08.841
I'm not going anywhere
without my protection.

02:03:12.094 --> 02:03:13.137
You heard him.

02:03:26.817 --> 02:03:29.111
Thank you, sir. Hey, Em!

02:03:30.696 --> 02:03:32.323
You wanna take a ride?

02:03:33.824 --> 02:03:35.451
Come on.

02:03:36.493 --> 02:03:37.745
- Can I go?
- Yeah, of course.

02:03:37.912 --> 02:03:39.496
Go with your father.

02:03:50.174 --> 02:03:51.884
She's an amazing girl.

02:03:52.051 --> 02:03:54.845
This way! Move this way!

02:03:56.347 --> 02:03:59.308
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

02:03:59.475 --> 02:04:00.768
You sure you're all right?

02:04:00.935 --> 02:04:02.645
I'm all right now.

02:04:02.811 --> 02:04:05.147
Good job, special agent.

02:04:05.314 --> 02:04:07.441
Thank you, general.

02:04:18.702 --> 02:04:21.914
If you ever want a private tour
of the White House, just let me know.

02:04:22.081 --> 02:04:24.792
I can hook it up like that.
I mean, maybe in a few weeks...

02:04:24.959 --> 02:04:26.599
...when we've got
the place back together.

02:04:26.669 --> 02:04:28.212
That's good to know.

02:04:33.217 --> 02:04:34.885
You wanna give him the news?

02:04:35.052 --> 02:04:38.305
Calls have been coming in
from all over the globe for the last hour.

02:04:38.472 --> 02:04:43.060
The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel
and France have all agreed to your terms.

02:04:43.227 --> 02:04:45.396
It looks like your peace plan is a go.

02:04:45.562 --> 02:04:48.691
You keep this up,
I just might have to vote for you.

02:04:48.857 --> 02:04:50.901
You wanna see something
really special?

02:04:51.068 --> 02:04:54.029
- Yeah.
- Carol.

02:04:56.907 --> 02:04:59.910
Henry, the president
wants to do the thing.

02:05:01.662 --> 02:05:02.746
Hold on tight.
