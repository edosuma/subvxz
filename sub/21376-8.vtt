Magic Johnson got a daughter?"

00:51.551 --> 00:54.763
No, this is something different.

00:54.846 --> 00:58.183

the odds.

black girl magic is.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.024
Because people don't

01:48.107 --> 01:50.151

- Jazmyn Simon, everybody

01:55.615 --> 01:57.408
- Wait a minute, James.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.452
{\an1}Were you really about to
mansplain

01:59.536 --> 02:00.912
what black girl magic was?

02:00.995 --> 02:04.040
{\an1}Why don't you let me, an
actual black woman,

02:04.123 --> 02:07.210
{\an1}fill everybody in on what black
girl magic is?

02:07.293 --> 02:10.003
- Well, Jazmyn, how would you
explain

02:10.088 --> 02:13.299
something so nuanced
and powerful...

02:13.383 --> 02:14.926
- All right.
- As black girl magic?

02:15.009 --> 02:16.594
- Let me break it down for
you...

02:16.678 --> 02:19.889
- Break it down.
- With a little bit of...magic.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.224
Voilà.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.851
Oh, that's why this is here.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.435
- I came with props.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.690
Now, the first part of a
magic trick is the pledge.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.025
Now, that's when a magician
shows you an object.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.778
In this
case, a super fine black woman,

02:33.862 --> 02:34.904
Come on out, Oye.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.741
- Oye.
- Oye. Oye.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.201
- You really seem to be going
through with this metaphor?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.121
- Yes, James. We're gonna need
a little help.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.914
Come on down, Norm.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.498
[cheers and applause]

02:45.582 --> 02:47.917

02:48.001 --> 02:50.336
{\an1}I'm gonna need
your help with the handcuffs.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
- Oh Norm's handcuffing?
- Oh, yeah.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.506
{\an3}- A black man is handcuffing
instead of

02:53.590 --> 02:54.716
getting handcuffed?

02:54.799 --> 02:57.051
Change.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.929
{\an1}- Now, the second part to the
magic trick is the turn.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.515
Now, that's when the magician
takes an ordinary something,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.976
{\an1}and they make it do something
extraordinary.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.936
- Oh, like the world finally
recognizing

03:07.020 --> 03:08.771
the comedic
brilliance of Leslie Jones?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.231
- Yep, mm-hmm.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.941
{\an1}In this case, we're gonna take a
black woman

03:12.025 --> 03:14.485
and handcuff her and
place her in a locked box.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.280
{\an1}Now, I'm gonna need Norm to
lock her down.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.282
{\an1}She only has one minute of air
in there,

03:19.365 --> 03:20.491
or she gonna suffocate.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.368
{\an7}Now, every sister in here
knows

03:22.452 --> 03:24.412
{\an7}that her oxygen has been
cut off in some way.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.957
{\an8}- You mean like Bill O'Reilly
making fun of Maxine Waters'

03:28.041 --> 03:29.834
{\an8}hair when she's making a point?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.377
{\an8}- Yep, just like that.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.925
{\an8}- Yep.
- Or like every Republican

{\an8}- Ooh, ooh, ooh, the girl, the
girl, the girl.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.642
{\an8}- Oh, my goodness, ya'll, she
only had one minute of oxygen.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.645
{\an7}We got to move on.
So look, what we gonna do is,

03:48.728 --> 03:51.314
{\an7}we will lift this up and give
this to Norm.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.440
{\an8}There you go, Norm.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.150
{\an8}The challenge isn't enough.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.778
{\an8}Against all odds, you have to
bring her back standing tall.

03:56.861 --> 04:00.406
{\an7}That's the last part,
the prestige.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.785
{\an7}Watch as black girl magic occurs
right before your eyes.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.162

word.

04:06.245 --> 04:09.123

04:45.994 --> 04:49.372
the magic black women possessed.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.165
I had just come home from
detention,

04:51.249 --> 04:54.502
and I watched as my mom made my
PlayStation disappear.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.431
They all married black women,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.599
and it made them more woke.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.226
Once you get a taste of it,

05:10.310 --> 05:13.187
you have to keep coming back for
more.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.731
Ain't that right?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.399

05:16.482 --> 05:17.525
Now, that's very different than

05:17.608 --> 05:21.070
"once you go black you never go
back."

05:21.154 --> 05:25.658
This is about intellect,
not how big our dicks are.

- James, James, wait.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.914
You gonna talk about dicks in
the same episode

Nah, come on. Stay the course

Good point.

and not our big black wands.

- In 1810 paying to watch and
grope

08:47.818 --> 08:48.778
and dehumanize Sarah Baartman.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.113
- Look, I'm not proud to say
this,

08:51.197 --> 08:53.616
but I personally follow
35 modern-day

08:53.699 --> 08:54.450
Sarah Baartman's online.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.702
You know,
Instagram models.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.623
I never knew
I was a European groper trapped

09:00.706 --> 09:02.458
in a young black man's body.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.126
<i>This ass fixation has obviously</i>
<i>been a boom for the owner</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:08.464
<i>of the Magic City strip clubs</i>
<i>but also for plastic surgeons.</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:11.717
{\an8}<i>This dude calls himself Dr. Los</i>
<i>Angeles, but he's more like</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:15.596
{\an8}<i>President Donald Rump, and he's</i>
<i>on a mission to make asses huge.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:19.475
{\an1}How many booties are you
operating on per week?

09:19.558 --> 09:21.143
{\an3}- Oh, i would say in the
10 to 15 range, yeah.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.770
- A week?
- Oh, yeah.

09:22.853 --> 09:26.315
{\an1}- So, that's like what,
three to five booties a day?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.400
- Yeah, exactly.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.194
{\an8}<i>- Man, homey's calendar</i>
<i>is packed.</i>

09:30.278 --> 09:33.823
{\an8}<i>[laughter]</i>

09:33.906 --> 09:35.324
- And how much are
these treatments?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.827
{\an3}- Usually between 12,000 and
14,000.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.703
{\an1}- Per cheek? Or the
whole booty?

09:38.786 --> 09:41.163
- The whole booty.
- Wow.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.332
- Has anyone come for
just one cheek?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.501
- Once.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.836
{\an3}When you do as many as
we do, you see everything.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.465
- What is it like knowing that
you're making millions

09:51.549 --> 09:53.175
off of giving people asses?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.469
- Good question.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.807
I just feel
like an artist really.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.142
It's a great thing.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.395
{\an3}I mean, how many people get to
make

10:04.478 --> 10:06.397
that kind of money doing
what they love?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.149
<i>- He's right.</i>

10:08.232 --> 10:09.900
<i>Statistically speaking, the</i>
<i>majority of people</i>

10:09.984 --> 10:14.030
{\an8}<i>who love asses don't get paid to</i>
<i>make asses.</i>

10:14.113 --> 10:16.157
Who is the ideal booty
out there

10:16.240 --> 10:18.492
that your patients
want to be like?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.911
- I would say Beyoncé.
I get a lot of Beyoncé.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.371
- Beyoncé.
- Yeah.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.582
- Do you feel like you are
profiting

10:24.665 --> 10:28.210
off the original
black booties?

10:28.294 --> 10:31.547
Do you feel like there's any
kind of appropriation happening?

10:31.630 --> 10:32.965
- Uh, good--good question.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.384
{\an3}I don't
really project what I think.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
- Okay.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.096
<i>But what if he did project</i>
<i>what he thought?</i>

10:43.267 --> 10:45.311
{\an1}I met a guy named Dr. Los
Angeles.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.645
Do you know him?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.230
- No.
- He's like Oprah.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.523
"You get a big booty.
You get a big booty.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.984
Everybody get a big booty."

10:52.068 --> 10:54.445
{\an3}- What's gonna happen if you
have this large,

10:54.528 --> 10:55.863
voluptuous butt?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.406
How is your life gonna
be different?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.407
- Maybe--maybe you get a sugar
daddy.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.243
But he don't love you.
- No.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.329
He just love the ass.
- That's right. That's right.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.081
- Man, Professor Anita was
making me see asses very

11:05.164 --> 11:08.000
differently than I did when I
was in college.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.543
And in my 20s.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.419
And five minutes before I
walked in to see her.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.256
You become an objectified thing.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.217
{\an3}- Yes. You have to change the
narrative.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.844
{\an3}You have to consciously and
actively construct a new image

11:18.928 --> 11:23.808
{\an3}of empowerment, of womanhood,
and of femininity.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.602
- You heard what the professor
said.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.939
We have to change the
narrative.

11:30.022 --> 11:34.485
So Norm and I
remixed "Ms. New Booty"

{\an8}♪ Black girl magic, magic,
magic, magic ♪

13:07.119 --> 13:11.707
- Last year, Hollywood finally
embraced black girl magic

13:11.790 --> 13:12.875
with the movie "Hidden Figures."

13:12.958 --> 13:16.504
[cheers and applause]

13:16.587 --> 13:20.716
And all it took was 80 years and
the hashtag OscarsSoWhite.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.552
Thanks to the movie, the once
unknown story of these historic

13:23.636 --> 13:27.223
black women is now well-known.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.391
But did you know there are
dozens of other

13:29.475 --> 13:32.228
"Hidden Figures"-type stories
waiting to be told,

13:32.311 --> 13:35.147
like Marie Van Brittan
Brown's story?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.775
She invented the
closed-circuit television,

13:37.858 --> 13:39.610
or in other words, the security
camera.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.403
So thanks a lot, Marie.

13:41.487 --> 13:46.742
You made it impossible for
us to steal at 7-Eleven.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.577
It's a very long list.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.205
Black women invented a machine
that removes cataracts with

13:51.288 --> 13:55.084
lasers, central heating, a
toaster with a digital clock

13:55.167 --> 13:57.086
that allows users to
control how brown

13:57.169 --> 14:00.089
they want their bread.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.050
Those are
all movies I want to see.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.469
Maybe not the toaster one,
but, you know.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.137
You know what?

14:07.221 --> 14:09.473
If Pixar made a movie where an
elderly toaster played by

14:09.557 --> 14:13.769
{\an8}Morgan Freemen tells his origin
story, I'd watch.

14:13.852 --> 14:14.937
{\an8}It's Morgan Freeman.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.939
It's Morgan Freeman.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.775
But "Hidden Figures" made a ton
of money,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.610
and that gave me an idea.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.573
Why not make a ton of money by
telling an inspirational story

14:25.656 --> 14:29.034
of another black woman, like
Shirley Ann Jackson?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.578
[cheers and applause]

14:30.661 --> 14:33.539
She was a science advisor to
President Obama.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.082
[cheers and applause]

14:35.165 --> 14:37.960
And in 1973,
Shirley Ann Jackson was the

14:38.043 --> 14:41.297
first black woman to get her
PhD from M.I.T.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.506
Make some noise.

14:42.590 --> 14:47.553
[cheers and applause]

14:47.636 --> 14:49.513
She did groundbreaking research
at Bell Labs

14:49.597 --> 14:52.141
that gave us caller ID.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.143
[cell phone chiming]

14:54.226 --> 14:58.188
No, I ain't gonna take that.
Shout-out to Shirley.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.316
She's alive, right?
Why am I looking up?

15:00.399 --> 15:04.153
[laughter]

15:04.236 --> 15:05.821
You know what, girl?

15:05.904 --> 15:07.323
You need your own movie.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.741
You need a Hollywood movie.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.743

15:22.338 --> 15:25.299
{\an3}- We won't know unless you
answer the telephone.

15:25.382 --> 15:29.553
That is how the telephone works.

{\an8}<i>- Uh, Ms. Jackson, a moment.</i>

15:33.724 --> 15:35.684
{\an3}I was speaking to a colleague at
Bell Laboratories.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.853
{\an3}He said they are looking for
bright young minds,

15:37.936 --> 15:39.521
outside-the-box thinkers.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.565
- Really? I've been mapping out
this idea

15:41.649 --> 15:43.901
for a phone line module that
indicates a caller's name

15:43.984 --> 15:46.987
when the telephone rings.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.114
- Okay, Ray Bradbury,

15:49.198 --> 15:52.034
save that for your science
fiction novels.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.995
{\an3}They're looking for
practical applications.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.378
{\an8}<i>- Sometimes, to realize a</i>

- What is your name?

16:19.812 --> 16:20.979

Jackson,

16:24.775 --> 16:28.028

Listen, tonight's "Do Dope Shit"

18:29.107 --> 18:31.235
is the message of the whole
episode.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.862
Appreciate the black women in
your life.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.824

18:36.907 --> 18:41.411
So I want to appreciate the most
important

18:41.495 --> 18:43.705
black woman in my life.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.375
I genuinely can't believe we
booked her.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.796
I mean, fresh off her world
tour, everybody go nuts

18:50.879 --> 18:52.339
when she walks out.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.425
Give it up for my mama.

18:55.509 --> 19:00.055
[cheers and applause]

19:00.138 --> 19:01.098
We got this.

One, two, mm, mm, mm.

19:04.893 --> 19:09.898
[cheers and applause]

19:09.982 --> 19:14.069
Thank you, Mom, for everything
you've done for me, honestly.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.904
- Well, you're welcome, honey.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.322

Aww.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.080
I can do for you?

19:25.163 --> 19:28.333
{\an1}- Well, you could not swear so
much.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.335
[together]
Ooh.

You know what?

19:31.962 --> 19:37.217
{\an3}Okay, okay,
can we change the graphic?

19:37.301 --> 19:42.306
{\an3}For you, Mama. "Do Dope Stuff.
Do Dope Stuff."

19:42.389 --> 19:44.349

cell phone,

19:54.776 --> 19:58.363
cable bill, electric bill,

19:58.447 --> 20:00.073

whole series.
