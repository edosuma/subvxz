WEBVTT

00:04.130 --> 00:08.123
I'm wishing on a star.

00:10.130 --> 00:14.385
To follow where you are.

00:17.140 --> 00:21.053
I'm wishing on a dream.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.189
To follow what it means.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.849
And I wish on all the rainbows

00:34.910 --> 00:37.276
that I've seen.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.073
I wish wish on all the people

00:40.120 --> 00:44.534
who really dream.

00:50.710 --> 00:55.500
I'm wishing on a star.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.390
- Which way?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.475
- Hold on a second,
hold on a second.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.680
Prince? Where's the prince?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.527
Prince? Prince?

01:11.570 --> 01:12.889
Where are you, prince?

01:12.940 --> 01:14.020
Hey.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.408
Is this still the right
way to your castle?

01:17.450 --> 01:20.908
- [Prince Wendell] Right,
um, I'll go and get a stick.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.440
- A stick? No.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.957
Hold on a second here,
big things are happening.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.412
Your step mother is my
wife, you understand that?

01:27.460 --> 01:28.870
The Queen.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.086
- Well, she was
the kind of woman

01:32.130 --> 01:34.337
that everybody was drawn to.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.964
I was just like everybody
else, I was crazy about her.

01:38.010 --> 01:41.343
I couldn't believe it when
she said she'd marry me.

01:41.390 --> 01:44.473
I knew she was sleeping
with other guys,

01:44.520 --> 01:46.977
she wasn't even
discreet about it.

01:47.020 --> 01:49.056
And I know that you don't like
hearing that kind of stuff

01:49.110 --> 01:51.260
because you just wanna
hear how nice she was

01:51.320 --> 01:52.605
because she was your mother.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.436
But the truth is that
she walked out on us

01:54.490 --> 01:56.856
and probably never gave
it a second thought.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.152
- Well, I don't believe that.

02:02.660 --> 02:05.788
- Argh, we're completely lost.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.458
- We've been walking round
in circles for hours.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.786
- Yeah, yeah, shut up.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.126
- Oh, look, look.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.832
- I'm not dead yet.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.007
You want some help? So do I.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.041
- Ah, help yourself.

02:20.090 --> 02:23.173
- Yeah, since when have
you ever helped us?

02:23.220 --> 02:26.678
- You won't find
them on your own.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.301
- We might, you never know.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.183
- And if we fail,
we fail as family.

02:32.230 --> 02:35.939
- Three trolls with
the courage of one.

02:35.990 --> 02:40.905
- I can find them, I just
can't catch them on my own.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.442
(they all talk at once)

02:47.830 --> 02:50.116
- What do you propose?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.206
- A partnership.

02:52.250 --> 02:56.129
(water rushes)

03:12.480 --> 03:16.974
(magical whooshing)

03:28.000 --> 03:29.206
- She never wanted me...

03:30.410 --> 03:32.071
- No, it was all my fault...

03:34.250 --> 03:38.914
- I hear them right on the
edge of the royal estate.

03:40.590 --> 03:41.966
- I don't remember
the night she left,

03:42.010 --> 03:43.329
but I remember the morning after

03:43.390 --> 03:46.132
because you were trying
to make me breakfast

03:46.180 --> 03:48.808
and you didn't know
where anything was.

03:48.850 --> 03:50.590
- I had to call your
grandmother over

03:50.640 --> 03:53.052
to look after you, because
I had to go to work.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.931
She kept saying, "Look, look,
she's playing with her bear,

03:56.980 --> 03:59.892
"she's gonna be fine."

03:59.940 --> 04:02.101
I noticed you had three
bears, you'd taken one though,

04:02.150 --> 04:04.106
and shoved him in the corner.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.650
And you said to him,

04:05.700 --> 04:08.112
"Now, you're gonna have
to stay there all alone."

04:10.410 --> 04:11.707
- Well, I knew she'd come back

04:11.750 --> 04:13.706
because she'd left all
her clothes, you know.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.913
She loved her clothes more
than anything in the world.

04:18.750 --> 04:23.005
And I kept going into her
room and checking on them.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.586
And then after a few
months you suddenly said

04:24.640 --> 04:25.925
that we had to get
rid of them all,

04:25.970 --> 04:29.428
so, I remember folding
them all very neatly,

04:29.470 --> 04:31.097
and I kept hoping that
there was going be,

04:31.140 --> 04:33.882
you know, a secret
note or something

04:33.940 --> 04:36.807
that would be written for
me, you know, just to me,

04:36.860 --> 04:40.273
telling me that she
loved me, and explaining

04:40.320 --> 04:44.108
the secret magical reason
why she had to go, you know?

04:47.030 --> 04:48.941
I mean, I still have
this uncontrollable urge

04:48.990 --> 04:51.697
to just go up to people
and say, "My mother left me

04:51.750 --> 04:53.206
"when I was seven."

04:55.080 --> 04:59.164
You know, as if that
would explain everything.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.916
And I miss her.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.460
And I hate her.

05:06.010 --> 05:09.343
And I miss her. (sobs)

05:09.390 --> 05:13.759
And I feel like I was on a train

05:13.810 --> 05:17.974
and it crashed or something,
and no one came and rescued me.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.819
I always wanted my life to
be a fairy story, you know?

05:37.880 --> 05:38.949
And now it is.

05:42.130 --> 05:43.119
Dad. Dad?

05:46.180 --> 05:49.001
(whooshing)

06:10.700 --> 06:13.157
- Yargg arg!

06:17.710 --> 06:18.779
- Leave her to me.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.991
- Argh, what?

06:21.040 --> 06:25.249
- It's your chance after the
queen is finished with her.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.007
(barking and growling)

06:39.060 --> 06:42.143
- Sir? Sir?

06:42.190 --> 06:43.930
Are you awake?

06:43.980 --> 06:46.028
(Pants)

06:46.070 --> 06:47.560
- Is it breakfast?

06:47.610 --> 06:49.020
- You're not yourself, sir.

06:51.490 --> 06:52.946
What is the matter?

06:56.830 --> 06:58.707
Sir, what is my name?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.036
Sir, I've known
you all your life,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.126
I even helped bring
you into being,

07:06.170 --> 07:09.219
and you do not even
know who I am, do you?

07:10.720 --> 07:11.584
- Um...

07:14.390 --> 07:15.345
Oh.

07:16.810 --> 07:20.473
I'm, just, I'm a dog, okay?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.182
I'm just a little
dog, that's what I am.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.935
I want to go home.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.351
I want to stay on all fours.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.654
Please, help me, old chap,
I'm just a poor little dog.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.077
I'm completely out
of my depth here.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.749
- Magic. I suspected as much.

07:38.790 --> 07:39.996
I must get a message to--

07:45.590 --> 07:47.160
- Get up from there.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.296
Get dressed.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.256
It's time to show our hand.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.929
(laughing)

08:02.980 --> 08:07.679
(incoherent drunken singing)

08:27.590 --> 08:29.160
- Dad, wake up.

08:29.210 --> 08:29.915
- What?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.712
- The helmsman's asleep.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.580
No one can see
us, we can escape.

08:33.630 --> 08:36.508
- We've got the handcuffs
on, our feet are tied.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.007
- Well, just jump off the back.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.051
N0 one's gonna see US, come on.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.011
- Would you look
at us? We can't.

08:43.060 --> 08:45.267
Aanay, what about the prince?

08:45.310 --> 08:49.019
- [Prince Wendell]
Go, go, go, master.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.146
- Look, just don't think
about it, just do it.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.064
Ready?

08:54.110 --> 08:56.943
One, two, three.

08:58.490 --> 08:59.479
Ugh.

09:02.290 --> 09:07.068
(drunken singing)

09:13.220 --> 09:15.256
- All right, so,

09:15.300 --> 09:18.849
was there a stage two
to your escape plan?

09:18.890 --> 09:22.974
- Starting today, no one is
allowed to leave the castle

09:23.020 --> 09:27.764
unless instructed to do
so by me and me alone.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.852
If asked, you shall simply say
that your master, the prince,

09:32.900 --> 09:35.312
has returned, and is well.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.114
If I hear one
rumor, one whisper,

09:39.160 --> 09:41.367
that anything is amiss,

09:41.410 --> 09:44.288
I will kill your
children in front of you.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.781
Messengers will be sent today

09:49.840 --> 09:52.877
to every king, queen,
emperor, and dignitary

09:52.920 --> 09:54.376
throughout the nine kingdoms

09:54.420 --> 09:58.049
inviting them to Prince
Wendell's coronation ball.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.927
The evening will
proceed as planned

10:01.970 --> 10:04.723
with one tiny exception,

10:07.440 --> 10:11.433
we are going to
murder all the guests.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.140
- Well listen, here's
what I don't understand,

10:14.190 --> 10:15.817
what's the point of escaping

10:15.860 --> 10:17.942
if we're just gonna
straight into the castle?

10:17.990 --> 10:21.403
- Look, it's a short
cut. It's quick.

10:22.740 --> 10:23.900
- You see that?

10:23.950 --> 10:25.110
Why do you think one
route is 39 miles,

10:25.160 --> 10:26.457
and the other is 13 miles.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.912
- Well, maybe there's a scenic
route, how should I know?

10:28.960 --> 10:29.870
Come on.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.126
- I don't think...

10:32.170 --> 10:34.240
It's gotta be longer
because it's safer.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.043
This looks, one has
trees, and, but this is...

10:41.090 --> 10:44.765
(ominous music)

10:44.810 --> 10:46.516
Oh, well look at that,

10:46.560 --> 10:49.643
you think it's maybe it's
going around something?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.976
- Maybe it's just not
suitable for carts.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.902
- Ah, oh look, it
squished again.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.321
Um, is it just me,

11:11.380 --> 11:14.998
or can you hear A
Whiter Shade Of Pale?

11:15.050 --> 11:18.042
(music plays in distance)

11:18.090 --> 11:19.671
- It's just you.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.756
- No, no, that's Procol Harum,
that organ is unmistakable.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.131
Listen, listen, listen.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.388
(wolf howls)

11:27.430 --> 11:29.728
- No, that's an animal howling.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.135
- I don't think so.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.057
What animal can skip
the light fandango.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.396
Turned cartwheels
cross the floor.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.853
Well, you don't get
lyrics like that any more.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.107
- You know, it's not too late
to turn around and go back.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.900
- No, wait, let's
just, we've this far,

11:43.950 --> 11:47.192
let's just continue on until
at least the end of sign one.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.498
The room was humming harder.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.541
(whizzing)

11:58.590 --> 12:01.047
As the ceiling flew away.

12:01.090 --> 12:03.331
Come on, you've gotta
be able to hear that.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.927
- What are all these lights?

12:05.970 --> 12:07.881
They could be fireflies.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.516
Ooh.

12:14.350 --> 12:17.103
(laughing)

12:17.150 --> 12:18.686
Who are you?

12:18.730 --> 12:20.482
- Who are you?

12:20.530 --> 12:23.488
- Everyone thinks they
can handle the swamp.

12:23.530 --> 12:27.614
- But they all end up in the
hands of the swamp witch.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.901
- Oh, great, the swamp witch?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.116
- There are three
things you mustn't do

12:33.170 --> 12:35.206
under any circumstances.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.877
Don't drink the water.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.956
- Don't eat the magic mushrooms.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.879
- And whatever you
do, don't fall asleep.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.172
- Okay, dad, why don't
we just keep moving.

12:45.220 --> 12:47.962
- [Fairy] Oh, look,
they're all chained up.

12:48.010 --> 12:50.058
- That can't be helping.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.727
Would you like to be
separated from each other?

12:51.770 --> 12:52.805
- Oh, yes.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.898
- More than you can imagine.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.089
- All right then.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.015
- No, let let me.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.858
- No, it's my turn
to be naughty.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.106
- Wait, what do you
mean be naught--

13:04.950 --> 13:07.487
Well, that's better, you
see, because we can just...

13:12.000 --> 13:13.991
- Dad?

13:14.040 --> 13:14.745
- We can...

13:15.870 --> 13:16.871
Virginia?

13:18.710 --> 13:19.665
- Dad?

13:19.710 --> 13:22.008
- Hey?

13:22.050 --> 13:23.256
When I said we wanted
to be separated,

13:23.300 --> 13:25.757
I didn't mean literally.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.210
Virginia?

13:27.260 --> 13:31.674
(ominous music)

13:42.190 --> 13:46.604
- Stay where you are or
I'll shove you in my pot.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.269
- Oh my god, this old witch.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.904
- Who dares enter the domain

13:52.950 --> 13:56.204
of the swamp witch?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.115
- Please don't
hurt me, I'm just..

14:01.170 --> 14:02.080
Acorn?

14:06.050 --> 14:07.039
- Oh, allo.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.215
- Hi.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.505
- Long time no see.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.675
- Yeah.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.017
- You, uh, still
looking for your mirror?

14:15.060 --> 14:16.220
- No, that one got smashed,

14:16.270 --> 14:18.306
we're looking for
another one now.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.011
You haven't seen my
father walking around

14:20.060 --> 14:21.891
anywhere here have you?

14:21.940 --> 14:24.602
Oh, he might have been singing
A Whiter Shade Of Pale.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.891
- Uh, no.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.656
Come in, I was just
making some soup.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.075
- Oh, thanks.

14:38.330 --> 14:41.128
I really thought you were
the swamp witch out there.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.128
- No, no, she's
been dead for years.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.912
This is a great place to lie
low when you're on the run.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.256
Nobody bothers you.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.258
- Well, who was the
swamp witch then?

14:52.300 --> 14:55.679
- Who was she? I thought
everyone knew that.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.130
- No.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.637
- Well, you know the
story of Snow White.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.227
- Yeah, from the
horse's mouth actually.

15:02.270 --> 15:03.510
- What?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.895
The swamp witch was
the wicked step-mother

15:07.940 --> 15:09.271
who tried to kill her.

15:09.320 --> 15:13.063
Well, this is where she crawled
to after they made her dance

15:13.120 --> 15:14.610
in the red-hot slippers.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.322
She spent the rest of her
life plotting revenge,

15:17.370 --> 15:19.656
but she was _too weak
to carry It out.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.749
Then she found someone
to do it for her.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.996
- Who was that?

15:25.050 --> 15:28.008
- Well, swamp witch is
buried in the basement.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.836
Why don't you go
down and ask her.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.609
Maybe what you
seek is down there.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.890
- What do you mean?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.657
- Dunno really, Ijust
always wanted to say it.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.827
Personally, I wouldn't
go down in that cellar

15:55.870 --> 15:57.826
for all the gold in
the nine kingdoms.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.576
(creaking)

16:07.920 --> 16:11.959
(ominous music)

16:29.730 --> 16:31.641
- My mother's been
here, I know it.

16:33.570 --> 16:34.901
(horns beep)

16:37.160 --> 16:38.821
- Stop!

16:47.040 --> 16:50.089
- Are you lost, my child?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.227
Are you lost?

17:06.480 --> 17:09.472
Let me show you the way.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.060
Come to me.

17:21.080 --> 17:25.449
Come with me and you
will lose your pain.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.740
Forever.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.953
Look, I am dying,

17:32.010 --> 17:35.969
but my work is unfinished.

17:36.010 --> 17:39.639
The house of Snow
White survives.

17:45.640 --> 17:50.475
and I will give
you all my power.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.866
- Poison is the way
the queen will strike,

18:06.920 --> 18:09.377
and the way she
must be defeated.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.241
You will find your
weapon in a grave.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.136
(ripping)

18:32.070 --> 18:34.812
Do not think. Become.

18:43.950 --> 18:47.534
- You are nothing!
She will crush you!

18:57.550 --> 19:01.509
(insects chirp)

19:07.270 --> 19:08.134
- Hey.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.392
Anybody gonna eat these eggs?

19:17.820 --> 19:19.731
Got a frying pan
here and everything?

19:21.660 --> 19:25.073
- Straight ahead 300 yards,
left at the rotting entrails,

19:25.120 --> 19:27.941
and you're out, 10, 15
minutes at the most.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.319
- Okay, I really can't leave

19:29.370 --> 19:31.827
without finding my
father first though.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.531
- He's probably asleep
on Mushroom Island.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.330
Everyone ends up there.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.165
You can't miss it.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.541
- Okay, thanks.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.500
(he chuckles)

19:41.550 --> 19:43.086
- Even if you want to.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.095
- [Mushroom] What
good is an omelette

19:53.150 --> 19:55.311
with nothing to put in it?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.022
- Pop in a couple of mushrooms
like us, for instance.

19:59.610 --> 20:02.909
- Yeah, right, forget it
guys, I'm not gonna eat you.

20:02.950 --> 20:05.271
- We weren't
suggesting you should.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.946
We were just trying to
point out the tarragon

20:07.990 --> 20:09.537
growing over there.

20:17.130 --> 20:18.290
- Smells like the real thing.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.876
- It is the real thing.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.467
It's_on_e of the
essential Ingredients

20:21.510 --> 20:23.250
of a mushroom omelette.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.927
(he chuckles)

20:24.970 --> 20:26.961
- I'm not gonna get
caught that way.

20:27.010 --> 20:31.219
- Mushroom omelette, nice
glass of Chteau Suau,

20:31.270 --> 20:32.931
little snooze.

20:34.850 --> 20:36.056
- All right, knock it off.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.568
- Well, at least have a
drink. You look parched.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.942
- I'm not gonna drink
any swamp water.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.697
- I know it's not the
clearest thing in the world,

20:44.740 --> 20:46.560
but it does pack a punch.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.737
It'll take you right up
the beanstalk and back.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.439
You know what I'm saying?

20:52.620 --> 20:55.032
(she yawns)

21:03.090 --> 21:03.875
- Dad?

21:05.430 --> 21:06.089
Dad.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.596
- Oh, hi.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.756
- Hi, thank god, I thought
I'd never see you again.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.846
- Come on up, you
want an omelette?

21:11.890 --> 21:14.518
- You're not drinking
the swamp water, are you?

21:14.560 --> 21:16.187
- Of course not.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.767
- Let's get out of here, I
can hardly keep my eyes open.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.890
- I know, me too, I'll tell
you what, just come on up here,

21:20.940 --> 21:23.773
have a seat, nice little island,
five minutes, that's all.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.947
- Okay, but we cannot fall
asleep no matter what.

21:25.990 --> 21:27.901
- Oh, no, of course not.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.076
- It looks good.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.577
- That was fantastic.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.655
Mmm.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.872
- Those mushrooms are far out.

21:44.340 --> 21:45.921
Dad!

21:45.970 --> 21:47.926
What are you doing?

21:47.970 --> 21:49.847
- What? What?

21:49.890 --> 21:51.596
Look who's talking!

21:51.640 --> 21:52.925
- What?

21:52.970 --> 21:55.768
- You've had three cups!

21:55.810 --> 21:57.937
- Really?

21:57.980 --> 21:59.800
I've had three?

22:06.110 --> 22:07.737
- Okay, you know, I'm gonna,

22:09.160 --> 22:10.866
I need to lie down for
a little while now,

22:10.910 --> 22:15.153
so it's really essential
that you stay awake, okay?

22:18.080 --> 22:19.069
Then I'll be fine.

22:21.090 --> 22:25.333
("A Whiter Shade Of
Pale" by Procol Harum)

22:34.430 --> 22:37.934
(he sings along with the music)

23:33.070 --> 23:37.279
(menacing music)

23:37.330 --> 23:39.457
- Virginia, wake up.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.531
Wake up, Virginia.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.911
- Mommy! Mommy!

23:44.960 --> 23:49.249
- It's all right, you were
having a bad dream, that's all.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.790
- Tell me a story.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.675
- All right.

23:55.180 --> 23:59.264
Once upon a time, there
was a lovely little girl

23:59.310 --> 24:02.188
who lived on the
edge of the forest.

24:02.230 --> 24:05.939
Her mommy told her never
to go into the forest,

24:05.980 --> 24:07.811
but do you know what she did?

24:07.860 --> 24:08.895
- No.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.192
- Yes you do.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.609
She ran into the forest
and she met a monster

24:15.660 --> 24:17.446
and then she died.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.902
And everyone forgot about her,

24:19.950 --> 24:23.408
and we all lived
happily ever after.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.246
- Virginia, where
are you? I need you.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.048
(phone rings)

24:30.090 --> 24:31.500
Yeah, big Tony here.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.710
- Dad, hi, it's me.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.751
Look, I just had to run away,

24:34.800 --> 24:36.711
but I left you a couple of pies,

24:36.760 --> 24:39.308
just pop them in the
microwave, you can't go wrong.

24:39.350 --> 24:40.806
- Hold on a second,
wait a minute,

24:40.850 --> 24:42.681
you can't run out on me,
that's what your mother did.

24:42.730 --> 24:46.052
Wait, wait, my princess.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.350
I miss you.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.608
Plus, I've got a
seven-year-old son here.

24:50.650 --> 24:52.606
You should be here
taking care of him.

24:52.650 --> 24:54.857
- Oh, well, I'm glad you
finally have a son now.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.117
At least that should
make you happy!

24:57.160 --> 24:58.275
Ugh!

25:01.040 --> 25:03.702
- Wake up, wake
up, or all is lost.

25:06.790 --> 25:10.954
(surreal music)

25:19.970 --> 25:21.961
(she coughs)

25:23.890 --> 25:26.973
- Aw, come on, I need
an electrician here.

25:27.940 --> 25:31.023
What's going on,
hey, the lights.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.857
Hey, come on, I'm not
gonna sit here in the dark,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.731
turn these lights on, hey!

25:49.420 --> 25:50.375
- Virginia.

25:51.590 --> 25:52.409
Virginia.

25:53.970 --> 25:54.755
Tony.

25:57.050 --> 25:59.257
Tony, wake up, wake up.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.840
- Lights, all the
lights are out--

26:01.890 --> 26:04.051
- I should never
have eaten the apple.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.590
- I almost died back
there, what the hell?

26:08.310 --> 26:09.857
- Oh, how did you find us?

26:09.900 --> 26:13.222
- Oh, Virginia, I've been
following you for a long time.

26:18.610 --> 26:19.907
- Oh my god.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.327
Oh.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.538
Where did you go after
you left Kissing Town?

26:28.580 --> 26:29.877
- Kissing Town...

26:30.500 --> 26:32.491
I went off for a while
to think about things.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.757
Picked up your trail
a few days ago.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.462
- But how? We went
through a mountain.

26:37.510 --> 26:41.719
- Virginia, I could follow
your scent across time itself.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.935
- You seem different.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.941
- We're both different.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.702
- I didn't mean
to chase you away.

27:09.290 --> 27:13.283
You know it was just,
everything was just happening

27:13.340 --> 27:15.126
so quickly, you know, and...

27:19.380 --> 27:21.041
I really do like you.

27:24.890 --> 27:25.879
I like you a lot.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.009
And I never--

27:32.060 --> 27:33.516
I never wanna hurt you.

27:39.070 --> 27:40.526
I think I love you.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.472
- So long have I waited for you.

28:15.980 --> 28:18.357
So many dull prison days.

28:19.650 --> 28:21.698
In the summer, I
could see the sunlight

28:21.740 --> 28:23.981
on my cell wall.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.988
I longed for the
summer to see the sun,

28:27.030 --> 28:29.863
yet every time it
came, I knew I had lost

28:29.910 --> 28:32.071
another year of my life to you.

28:33.250 --> 28:36.913
When all of this is over, I
will put you in a little box

28:36.960 --> 28:40.714
until you curl up
and die of despair.

28:44.050 --> 28:45.631
Where was he caught?

28:45.680 --> 28:48.308
- 15 miles from here.

28:48.350 --> 28:52.059
- So near. What
about the others?

28:56.520 --> 28:58.067
- We killed them.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.987
- Liar!

29:07.030 --> 29:08.986
Idiot!

29:09.030 --> 29:12.363
- We are extremely
stupid, you majesty.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.571
- But we have the dog.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.036
- Fools.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.871
The dog is not the threat to me.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.789
The girl.

29:27.550 --> 29:28.960
The girl is the threat.

29:33.770 --> 29:34.589
- Come on.

29:37.730 --> 29:38.936
Come on, come on.

29:46.070 --> 29:48.368
The journey's end,
Wendell's Castle.

29:48.410 --> 29:49.946
- [Tony] That's
where the mirror is.

29:49.990 --> 29:51.821
- [Virginia] And that's
how we're gonna get home.

29:54.370 --> 29:55.826
- Let's take a little
rest before we go on, huh?

29:55.870 --> 29:57.280
I'll get some water,
and one of you guys

29:57.330 --> 29:58.820
wanna get some wood?

29:58.880 --> 29:59.835
- I'll go.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.450
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.266
- Virginia,

30:16.310 --> 30:18.016
there's something I'd really
like you to do for me,

30:18.060 --> 30:19.937
I mean, with me.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.266
And I think I deserve it,
given my multiple savings

30:22.320 --> 30:23.810
of your life.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.019
(he gasps)

30:26.070 --> 30:28.152
- Oh cripes, oh I
want you so much.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.519
- I know, I want you too.

30:29.570 --> 30:30.867
- All right, all
right, all right,

30:30.910 --> 30:32.821
you run into the woods,
and I'll cover my eyes.

30:33.870 --> 30:35.155
- Sorry?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.246
- Into the trees, and
I'll cover my eyes,

30:36.290 --> 30:37.780
and I'll count to 100.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.457
- Are you serious?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.377
- Oh, yes.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.206
Oh, I won't cheat.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.581
I promise, I won't cheat.

30:44.630 --> 30:45.961
- That's not the point, I--

30:46.010 --> 30:46.965
- All right, all
right, all right,

30:47.010 --> 30:48.580
maybe I'll count a
little quicker after 50,

30:48.630 --> 30:50.086
but I promise you'll get
a proper count from me.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.290
- I am not playing
hide and seek with you.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.590
- Come on, come on, come on.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.052
One, two, three--

30:56.100 --> 30:57.636
- No!

30:57.690 --> 31:00.511
- Four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, you better run,

31:03.320 --> 31:04.526
16, 17, 18, 19,

31:04.570 --> 31:07.027
72, 73, 74,

31:07.070 --> 31:11.063
98, 99, 100!

31:11.120 --> 31:14.442
Ahh! Coming!

31:19.920 --> 31:24.038
(tense music)

31:56.990 --> 31:58.241
(she screams)

32:04.072 --> 32:26.020
(they grow! and snarl)

32:26.020 --> 32:27.510
- Oh, it's about time.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.698
Where's the wood? For the fire?

32:31.740 --> 32:34.482
- Oh, we couldn't find any.

32:34.530 --> 32:37.192
- Couldn't find any
wood? In a forest?

32:39.950 --> 32:41.030
- Hello, Tony.

32:42.290 --> 32:43.700
- You don't have
any wood either.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.036
- Yes, thank you.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.523
- We're so lucky, a
coronation only comes along

33:13.570 --> 33:17.984
once every 2,785
mouse generations.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.742
- But I don't think there's
going to be a coronation,

33:21.790 --> 33:24.862
I saw Prince Wendell
lying under his bed.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.820
He looked barking mad.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.121
- Oh no, that can't be right,

33:29.170 --> 33:32.754
he's probably just anxious
about serving the right cheese.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.041
- They say that Cinderella's
going to be here.

33:35.090 --> 33:38.423
- No? She must be 200 years old.

33:38.470 --> 33:40.347
- I heard she doesn't
want to show her face

33:40.390 --> 33:42.210
because she doesn't
want to 5pm! the memory

33:42.270 --> 33:43.385
of her beauty.

33:43.430 --> 33:45.978
- Uh oh, I thought
as much. Look!

33:46.020 --> 33:48.306
- Mouse traps, make
yourselves scarce.

33:57.070 --> 34:00.028
- Oh, oh, that's Old King Cole.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.230
(laughing)

34:03.950 --> 34:05.201
Oh, presents!

34:07.960 --> 34:10.622
They're all going to the castle
for Wendell's coronation.

34:10.670 --> 34:11.796
Oh, come on.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.756
- Whoa, let's just
walk in there.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.870
- If I'm right, this is no
longer Prince Wendell's castle,

34:16.930 --> 34:18.716
it's controlled by The Queen.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.002
The guards may now be her
eyes, we can trust no one.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.427
- Wolf, I have to
tell you something.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.048
- What?

34:28.060 --> 34:29.300
- The Queen...

34:31.610 --> 34:32.599
- Yeah?

34:34.940 --> 34:36.942
- Is my mother.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.980
- I knew that

34:44.040 --> 34:46.577
from the first
moment I smelled you.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.450
- All right, so, what now?

34:54.050 --> 34:55.256
- We'll wait here until dark

34:55.300 --> 34:57.541
before we try and
enter the castle.

34:57.590 --> 34:59.046
- What do we do all day?

34:59.090 --> 35:02.344
- Sleep. We're exhausted.

35:02.390 --> 35:03.175
Are we not?

35:03.220 --> 35:05.051
- Definitely.

35:08.060 --> 35:09.470
- Did I miss something?

35:14.860 --> 35:17.567
- [Man] Welcome to Prince
Wendell's castle...

35:20.450 --> 35:21.940
- Yes?

35:21.990 --> 35:24.948
- The guards haven't seen them.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.323
What do you want me to
do if they don't show up?

35:28.370 --> 35:30.952
- They'll show up.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.831
They'll come in
amongst the others

35:32.880 --> 35:34.950
when they think they are safe.

35:37.460 --> 35:40.088
Signal to start the
coronation ball.

35:43.100 --> 35:43.964
- Yes, my lady.

35:44.010 --> 35:48.049
(dramatic music)

36:10.910 --> 36:14.835
(fireworks explode)

36:19.510 --> 36:21.671
- Look, look.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.047
That looks promising.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.842
- Promising? What are
you talking about?

36:29.980 --> 36:31.049
- Swim under the grill,

36:31.100 --> 36:33.182
it's bound to surface
somewhere in the castle.

36:33.230 --> 36:34.345
- Somewhere?

36:34.400 --> 36:35.389
- Oh good, for a second there,

36:35.440 --> 36:37.101
I didn't think you had a plan.

36:37.150 --> 36:38.936
- Follow me.

36:38.980 --> 36:39.935
(he inhales deeply)

36:39.990 --> 36:41.196
- [Tony] Wait a minute--

36:41.240 --> 36:42.446
Wolf!

36:43.610 --> 36:45.271
I'm not gonna go and
dive under the water

36:45.320 --> 36:47.868
to hope we're gonna surface
somewhere in the castle.

36:50.910 --> 36:53.162
- Wolf's not coming out, he
must have found the way in.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.825
- Why does that follow?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.667
He could have just run out of
air, and he could be drowned.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.128
Virginia, don't, no,
Virginia, Virginia!

37:03.180 --> 37:04.295
Wait!

37:05.930 --> 37:06.999
Oh.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.446
- Come on.

37:29.030 --> 37:31.578
(she inhales deeply)

37:31.620 --> 37:32.905
You can make it.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.404
Come on, come on.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.781
- I thought I was gonna drown.

37:36.830 --> 37:38.912
- Come on, get up.

37:43.550 --> 37:44.460
You all right?

37:45.760 --> 37:46.749
- [Virginia] Where's dad?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.256
- [Wolf] I don't know.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.927
- Come on, dad.

37:49.970 --> 37:52.018
- Passage was very
thin at the top.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.556
- [Virginia] Just
come on through.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.976
- Come on, come on, Tony.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.009
- I'm gonna have to go back--

37:57.060 --> 37:58.516
- No, no, no, no, no.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.857
No, no, come on Tony.

38:01.530 --> 38:02.098
- Dad?

38:02.150 --> 38:03.435
- Okay, come on.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.862
- [Virginia] Are you okay?

38:11.950 --> 38:13.440
- [Wolf] There you go,

38:14.790 --> 38:15.859
- [Virginia] All right.

38:15.910 --> 38:17.161
- I almost drowned in there.

38:17.210 --> 38:19.531
- Oh, don't exaggerate.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.786
It's this way.

38:23.420 --> 38:25.581
- Okay, I need a towel.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.790
- Towels? We need weapons!

38:26.840 --> 38:28.831
- Shh, Shh.

38:28.890 --> 38:29.879
Doors, come on.

38:31.970 --> 38:34.382
(toad croaks)

38:35.930 --> 38:37.886
- One door leads to safety,

38:37.940 --> 38:40.898
one door leads to a
horrible death, ribbit.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.938
- I learned this in school,
but I can never remember it.

38:45.990 --> 38:50.484
- You may ask one
question. Ribbit.

38:50.530 --> 38:52.862
But I always lie.

38:52.910 --> 38:55.868
- Okay, okay, if we ask him
which door is the safe door--

38:55.910 --> 38:58.538
- Right, well then he'll lie,
and say it's the other one.

38:58.580 --> 38:59.456
- Isn't it?

38:59.500 --> 39:00.455
- Or is it the other way around?

39:00.500 --> 39:01.455
- I dunno.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.990
- Time's up, man.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.449
- Wait a minute,
I have a question.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.912
What is the point
in having a door

39:06.970 --> 39:08.790
that has a horrible
death behind it, huh?

39:08.840 --> 39:09.829
- Get your hands off me.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.289
- What does that achieve?

39:11.350 --> 39:12.465
' [Toad] What are you doing?

39:12.510 --> 39:14.887
- What is the
purpose of your life?

39:14.930 --> 39:16.010
Just to be a pain?

39:16.060 --> 39:17.015
- Hey, don't touch me there,

39:17.060 --> 39:18.721
only my girlfriend
touches me there.

39:18.770 --> 39:19.976
Ahhh...

39:28.700 --> 39:30.236
- I guess it's the other one.

39:32.030 --> 39:35.864
(people talk together
indistinctly)

39:38.620 --> 39:40.451
- Where is the prince?

39:40.500 --> 39:43.242
- The country's not been the
same since the troll invasion.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.501
- Rude, if you ask me.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.461
Being late for his
own coronation?

39:48.510 --> 39:51.297
- Yes, my riding
boots are killing me.

39:53.180 --> 39:54.420
- There's Old King Cole,

39:54.470 --> 39:56.176
we must introduce
you to my tallor.

39:56.220 --> 39:58.427
What do you think?

39:58.480 --> 40:00.266
- Your royal highness.

40:00.310 --> 40:03.518
Lords and ladies,
ladies and gentlemen,

40:03.560 --> 40:06.939
may I present to you a
vision of loveliness,

40:06.980 --> 40:09.949
the dancing queen,
the slipper supreme,

40:09.990 --> 40:14.939
it's midnight madness,
it's Queen Cinderella!

40:14.990 --> 40:19.324
(fanfare)

40:19.370 --> 40:24.205
(clapping)

40:32.180 --> 40:34.250
- Ooh, look at that.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.848
- She can't be 200.

40:36.890 --> 40:39.632
- Hah, she's just had
a lot of magic surgery.

40:42.480 --> 40:47.349
(she coughs and wheezes)

40:58.870 --> 41:00.861
- Where's Wendell?

41:04.370 --> 41:05.997
- Shh shh.

41:07.380 --> 41:08.950
These are the royal chambers,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.468
the queen will sleep as near
her dog impostor as possible.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.001
Now, my deduction, is that
she will have our prince

41:14.050 --> 41:16.257
in the very next room.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.255
There.

41:24.980 --> 41:25.969
Maybe I'm wrong.

41:27.940 --> 41:29.100
Close the door, close the door.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.036
- This must be a guest room.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.708
- No, this is her room.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.305
- What are those?

42:06.350 --> 42:07.977
- Yeah, what are those?

42:12.070 --> 42:14.732
- Oh, mirrors, mirrors.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.235
Ah.

42:23.450 --> 42:24.997
Oh, I got it!

42:25.040 --> 42:27.668
That's it, we have
the travelling mirror.

42:27.710 --> 42:28.950
Wait.

42:32.460 --> 42:35.418
Manhattan, we've found
it. We can go home.

42:37.130 --> 42:38.677
Virginia, what?

42:38.720 --> 42:40.256
No, please come on, let's just
go while we can, let's go.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.551
- I can't go yet.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.919
- What? Yes, no, you can.

42:42.970 --> 42:44.597
Would you please, Wolf,
tell her, you can go.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.516
Let's just go.

42:45.560 --> 42:46.879
- No, I have to see her first.

42:46.940 --> 42:47.838
- No you don't.

42:47.890 --> 42:48.891
Listen, she is not your mother.

42:48.940 --> 42:50.225
Whoever this person is,
she's not Christine.

42:50.270 --> 42:51.817
She's not the
woman that we knew.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.021
- We have been led here
all along, don't you see?

42:54.070 --> 42:55.526
It was never the mirror.

42:55.570 --> 42:57.856
It was just a way to
bring us here to meet her.

42:57.900 --> 43:00.152
- Please, let us go home
while we can still go home.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.906
- No, I have to see her.

43:01.950 --> 43:05.283
- You last request is granted.

43:07.910 --> 43:11.243
- Did I do well, your majesty?

43:11.290 --> 43:12.837
- Excellent well.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.086
- What?

43:17.130 --> 43:19.792
- I thought it safest
to stick with them.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.843
Make sure they don't
spoil your plans.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.136
- What have you done?

43:28.180 --> 43:30.933
- It's very simple, Virginia,

43:30.980 --> 43:32.971
I obey the queen.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.236
- Christine, what
are you doing here?

43:37.280 --> 43:39.817
Don't you recognize us?

43:39.860 --> 43:42.738
_- I've never seen
either of you before.

43:42.780 --> 43:46.614
- Of course you have. I'm
your daughter, Virginia.

43:47.950 --> 43:49.747
- Christine don't
look through me--

43:50.920 --> 43:52.911
Don't look through me, all
right? It's me, it's Tony.

43:52.960 --> 43:57.329
- I said I don't
know who you are.

43:57.380 --> 44:00.588
- Mom, we came from New
York where you used to live.

44:17.900 --> 44:21.142
- This is just magic
to distract me.

44:23.070 --> 44:24.981
- [Huntsman] My lady?

44:28.040 --> 44:29.655
- Leave me alone with this girl

44:29.700 --> 44:32.328
and take him to the dungeon.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.951
Bring Wendell to me.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.546
Wolf.

44:39.670 --> 44:41.672
You can go to the kitchen now.

44:50.680 --> 44:54.969
I've sensed you for a long
time through my mirrors.

44:55.020 --> 44:57.602
But your image has
always been denied me,

44:57.650 --> 45:01.393
now why is that, do you suppose?

45:01.440 --> 45:04.523
You don't look very
powerful to me.

45:04.570 --> 45:07.118
Has someone been helping you?

45:07.160 --> 45:10.948
Some little dead heroine
puffing you up as an adversary?

45:12.830 --> 45:14.912
- I am your daughter.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.779
- I don't have a daughter.

45:30.270 --> 45:33.057
- Why did you leave me?

45:33.100 --> 45:37.264
- You were _unwanted.
That's plain to see.

45:39.190 --> 45:42.819
Haven't you always
known that, secretly?

45:45.110 --> 45:46.816
That you were the ugly duckling?

45:48.950 --> 45:51.748
The sad thing is,
your little quest

45:51.790 --> 45:54.031
has given you
delusions of grandeur.

45:54.080 --> 45:57.823
You started to think you're
capable of great things but,

45:59.840 --> 46:03.378
you were right in
the first place.

46:03.420 --> 46:04.500
You're plain.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.927
Plain and ugly.

46:11.180 --> 46:12.306
Come.

46:13.270 --> 46:16.137
Compare yourself
to me in my mirror.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.896
Mirrors cannot lie.

46:19.980 --> 46:23.063
You think you are
fairer than me? Look.

46:26.030 --> 46:27.156
Ask the mirror.

46:28.780 --> 46:32.819
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

46:34.200 --> 46:36.248
- What are you doing to me?

46:37.540 --> 46:42.455
- Who is the
fairest of them all?

46:43.670 --> 46:45.501
- What are you doing?

46:51.930 --> 46:55.514
(dramatic music)

46:58.520 --> 46:59.896
No!

47:01.560 --> 47:04.142
(she coughs)

47:04.190 --> 47:06.021
- You intrigue me.

47:07.990 --> 47:09.651
Why have you come here?

47:09.700 --> 47:12.407
- To find you. To talk to you.

47:12.450 --> 47:13.826
To make you realize who--

47:13.870 --> 47:16.498
- To kill me.

47:16.540 --> 47:18.952
- No! No, of course not.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.912
- I'm going to kill
you first, now...

47:23.630 --> 47:25.507
- You stay back or I'll...

47:27.800 --> 47:29.256
- Or what?

47:29.300 --> 47:30.836
Looking for this?

47:34.810 --> 47:38.348
I know everything. All your
pathetic plans, everything.

47:38.390 --> 47:40.972
You think Snow
White will help you?

47:41.020 --> 47:44.899
She's dead. Dead.

47:44.940 --> 47:46.680
That's why she
sent a little girl

47:46.730 --> 47:48.891
after me with old magic.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.195
Is it poison?

47:55.200 --> 47:56.189
- No.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.360
- Oh, you little liar.

48:01.330 --> 48:04.879
If this were to pierce my skin,

48:04.920 --> 48:07.127
it would kill me instantly.

48:12.010 --> 48:14.342
It is very beautiful though.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.801
- In your whole life, did
you ever once love me?

48:32.950 --> 48:35.191
(she cries)

48:39.250 --> 48:40.615
- Stop!

48:58.180 --> 49:00.091
- Oh, that's not me.

49:00.140 --> 49:01.346
Oh!

49:27.920 --> 49:30.912
- My lady, we have a
problem in the kitchens.

49:43.690 --> 49:46.557
- Take this girl
away and lock her up.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.898
I will finish with
her afterwards.

49:50.940 --> 49:54.103
- After what? What are
you gonna do to everybody?

49:59.280 --> 50:01.532
- No more than you
would do to me.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.508
- Oh, Virginia.

50:17.550 --> 50:18.790
- Oh, clad.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.936
- Are you okay?

50:35.610 --> 50:36.816
- Oh, I'm sorry.

50:43.660 --> 50:44.991
- What happened to her?

50:45.040 --> 50:48.828
- She's crazy, she's just,
she's sick, and she's...

50:50.710 --> 50:52.951
Before she_left
us she was just--

50:53.000 --> 50:55.161
She was getting worse,
and worse, and worse.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.845
I've never...

51:06.600 --> 51:08.807
I've never told anybody what
happened the night she left.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.727
And you, you didn't
even remember.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.397
So I couldn't tell you.

51:15.490 --> 51:16.775
- What happened?

51:38.840 --> 51:43.379
(dramatic music)

51:44.510 --> 51:47.058
- She was trying to drown you.

51:47.100 --> 51:49.056
- What do you mean?

51:51.400 --> 51:52.970
That's not true.

51:53.020 --> 51:54.851
- If I'd have come
home a minute later,

51:54.900 --> 51:56.811
you would have been dead.

52:03.070 --> 52:06.858
- Don't pant, don't
bark, and stop muttering.

52:06.910 --> 52:09.788
- I'm trying to
remember my speech.

52:15.130 --> 52:17.041
- You do this properly tonight,

52:17.090 --> 52:19.297
and you can have
any bitch in town.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.846
- You!

52:25.890 --> 52:28.017
- Keep them apart,
don't let them touch.

52:28.060 --> 52:29.300
- But that's me!

52:29.350 --> 52:31.386
- The guests are getting
suspicious, my lady.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.976
- Take the dog to
my hiding place,

52:33.020 --> 52:35.056
I'll meet you there shortly,
I have one last thing to do.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.277
This kingdom can be ours.

52:42.240 --> 52:45.368
They will test you, but
beware of Cinderella,

52:45.410 --> 52:47.731
she is your greatest threat.

52:49.620 --> 52:50.496
(animal squeals)

52:50.540 --> 52:51.780
- Don't move.

52:56.170 --> 52:57.239
Oh yeah.

52:59.460 --> 53:01.792
Oh ho ho ho, that's good.

53:04.340 --> 53:06.251
All present and correct.

53:08.890 --> 53:10.881
- As you commanded, majesty,

53:10.930 --> 53:14.434
the most powerful
poison ever created.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.930
-SmddeMe

53:21.400 --> 53:23.903
- The poison? Did he say poison?

53:23.950 --> 53:25.906
- It's not pumpkin soup then.

53:25.950 --> 53:29.283
- Have you tasted it yet?

53:29.330 --> 53:30.866
- Of course not, majesty.

53:30.910 --> 53:32.207
- Well then, how do you know

53:32.250 --> 53:35.037
it's the most powerful
poison ever made?

53:35.080 --> 53:37.958
- Yeah, how do you know?

53:38.000 --> 53:39.740
- Well?

53:41.340 --> 53:42.716
Try it.

53:56.730 --> 53:59.312
(he gasps)

54:02.440 --> 54:04.488
- It's definitely not
pumpkin soup then.

54:04.530 --> 54:06.737
- Look at him, dead
as a doormouse.

54:06.780 --> 54:10.614
- Mouse traps, deadly
poison, processed cheese.

54:10.660 --> 54:12.196
It's not like the old days.

54:12.250 --> 54:16.289
- My crafty little wolf, you
had me worried for a while.

54:16.330 --> 54:19.288
- Oh, when you freed me from
prison, I agreed to serve you.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.797
A wolf always keeps his bargain.

54:23.630 --> 54:26.758
- After tonight, when I
rule the nine kingdoms,

54:26.800 --> 54:29.132
wolves will be very important.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.842
I will make them
my secret police,

54:31.890 --> 54:33.881
and you will be the chief.

54:36.980 --> 54:39.016
- [Wolf] Chief wolf!

54:39.060 --> 54:40.857
- We've been waiting for hours.

54:40.900 --> 54:45.519
(they talk indistinctly)

54:50.120 --> 54:54.079
- Be silent for the future
king of the fourth kingdom.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.360
(fanfare)

54:55.410 --> 54:59.119
I present to you,
the man of the hour,

54:59.170 --> 55:04.085
the hero of the day, his
royal personality of the year,

55:04.130 --> 55:06.712
he's simply the best,

55:06.760 --> 55:10.673
Prince Wendell
Winston Walter White!

55:10.720 --> 55:15.339
(clapping and cheering)

55:26.990 --> 55:29.311
- Ta-da!

55:29.360 --> 55:30.657
Wendy.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.576
- Mwah!

55:38.910 --> 55:42.789
- There were some rumors that
trouble had befallen you,

55:42.840 --> 55:44.410
is that true?

55:44.460 --> 55:48.874
- No, I just went for long
walkies around my kingdom.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.376
As one does.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.428
- Huff puff, chief wolf!

55:55.470 --> 55:57.301
The wolves will run
out of town this time,

55:57.350 --> 55:59.727
the farmers don't know
what's gonna bite 'em.

56:01.230 --> 56:02.356
Excuse me.

56:06.570 --> 56:10.563
(he sings)

56:18.200 --> 56:19.610
Cinderella...

56:22.830 --> 56:24.536
- Hey, look at this.

56:24.590 --> 56:26.160
I saw this earlier,
blew me away.

56:27.710 --> 56:29.792
- Grimm? As in Grimm Grimm?

56:29.840 --> 56:31.296
- Gotta be, gotta be, right?

56:31.340 --> 56:32.830
I mean all those stories,
they weren't made up.

56:32.890 --> 56:35.211
They're true, he was
here 200 years ago.

56:35.260 --> 56:36.841
- Wow.

56:36.890 --> 56:38.209
- Grimm fairy stories,
you remember those?

56:38.270 --> 56:40.556
I used to read those to
you when you were a kid.

56:40.600 --> 56:41.885
You used to sit on my knee,

56:41.940 --> 56:44.727
the one about the donkey
would only eat thistles.

56:44.770 --> 56:47.147
- Oh, that was House
at Pooh Corner.

56:47.190 --> 56:48.350
- Yeah.

56:50.360 --> 56:51.896
- What does this
say? What is that?

56:51.950 --> 56:53.406
- I dunno, I tried reading
it, it's in German,

56:53.450 --> 56:55.020
it must be German.

56:55.070 --> 56:56.947
- [Mouse] I can speak German.

56:56.990 --> 56:59.697
- So can I, cheese is kse.

57:01.660 --> 57:03.616
- Our great, great,
great, great, great,

57:03.670 --> 57:05.877
great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great,

57:05.920 --> 57:07.740
great, great, great,
great grandfather

57:07.800 --> 57:11.167
learnt it from
Wilhelm Grimm himself.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.132
- Well, how sweet,
German speaking mice.

57:14.180 --> 57:16.796
- Okay, okay, so what
does this say here, this.

57:16.850 --> 57:21.970
Wenn _sie fliehen wollen
mussen Sle die hebel drehen?

57:22.020 --> 57:23.806
- Must you the handle turn--

57:23.850 --> 57:27.354
- No, the lever turn.

57:27.400 --> 57:30.142
Handle is klinke.

57:30.190 --> 57:34.149
- Must you the lever turn
if you wish to escape.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.065
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, escape?

57:36.120 --> 57:38.657
- Lever? Lever!

57:38.700 --> 57:41.863
- Lever, lever. There
are here no levers.

57:41.910 --> 57:43.207
The rings! The rings!

57:43.250 --> 57:44.820
Turn the rings! Turn the rings!

57:46.670 --> 57:48.877
Oh wait, over there, get the
ones over there, try 'em.

57:57.890 --> 58:01.712
- Hurry up, come on. We
might still have time.

58:01.770 --> 58:04.682
- If anyone can save the
nine kingdoms, it's you.

58:04.730 --> 58:06.937
- Good luck, you're
going to need it.

58:08.520 --> 58:09.600
- Thanks.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.608
- Until the prince's
21 st birthday,

58:14.650 --> 58:17.813
the throne has lain
in trust for him.

58:17.870 --> 58:20.942
But, before he can become king,

58:20.990 --> 58:24.824
he must first show us that he
has learned the three values

58:24.870 --> 58:29.955
of course, wisdom, and humility.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.757
Let the first
challenger step forward.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.336
- Wendell.

58:40.300 --> 58:43.929
I am Leaf Fall,
queen of the elves.

58:43.970 --> 58:46.302
It is a very great
responsibility you take

58:46.350 --> 58:48.898
upon your young shoulders today.

58:48.940 --> 58:52.979
And I wonder if you are
brave enough to join us.

58:55.570 --> 58:59.062
- His bravery is questioned.

58:59.110 --> 59:01.829
- Tell us, tell us the tale.

59:01.870 --> 59:05.783
(everyone shouts at once)

59:07.790 --> 59:11.032
- The troll king
threatened this kingdom.

59:11.090 --> 59:15.459
I challenged him to
a fight, man to mutt,

59:15.510 --> 59:19.219
and he was huge, and horrible,
and he drew his sword,

59:19.260 --> 59:21.842
and both of us fought, and
then I dropped to all fours,

59:21.890 --> 59:23.926
and I was snarling.

59:23.970 --> 59:26.882
And then he lunged, at me,
and then I clawed at him,

59:26.930 --> 59:30.184
and then I sunk my teeth in him,

59:30.230 --> 59:32.937
and I ripped his throat out.

59:36.150 --> 59:38.857
- Bravo. Magnificent.

59:38.900 --> 59:41.403
- Such animal courage.

59:41.450 --> 59:42.940
- Bravo.

59:44.910 --> 59:49.665
He has passed the first test,
Wendell is king of courage!

59:49.710 --> 59:53.202
(they clap and cheer)

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:09.760
- Take a weapon.

1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:12.516
- What do you mean
take a weapon?

1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.016
We don't know anything
about fighting.

1:00:14.060 --> 1:00:17.063
- Take a weapon, dad.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.123
(fanfare)

1:00:38.170 --> 1:00:40.968
- It is time for the
second challenge.

1:00:41.010 --> 1:00:43.251
Queen Riding Hood the Third,

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.507
ruler of the second kingdom.

1:00:45.550 --> 1:00:49.839
(clapping)

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:55.762
- What wisdom have you
learnt on your recent journey

1:00:55.810 --> 1:00:57.892
through your kingdom?

1:00:59.570 --> 1:01:00.639
- Uh...

1:01:02.030 --> 1:01:03.691
That's a tricky one.

1:01:04.910 --> 1:01:08.698
I have walked every road,

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:14.322
I have sniffed every hedgerow,

1:01:14.380 --> 1:01:17.838
I have roamed the land,

1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:21.919
and found bones.

1:01:22.930 --> 1:01:24.386
- Bones?

1:01:25.430 --> 1:01:27.807
- I found this huge pile

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:31.763
of a hundred fresh, juicy bones.

1:01:31.810 --> 1:01:36.429
So, I took one, and I
buried the other 99.

1:01:39.610 --> 1:01:41.931
- Sound thinking?

1:01:41.990 --> 1:01:43.480
- Cunning.

1:01:44.410 --> 1:01:48.028
- Build up our military
reserves for times of war.

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:50.196
Wise indeed.

1:01:51.450 --> 1:01:53.782
- He has passed the
second challenge.

1:01:53.830 --> 1:01:55.866
Wise Wendell.

1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.243
(they clap and cheer)

1:02:10.890 --> 1:02:12.380
- Which way?

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:14.879
- Here.

1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:20.568
- No, I definitely
think it's this way.

1:02:20.610 --> 1:02:23.488
- What? Why did you ask
me in the first place

1:02:25.990 --> 1:02:26.945
Sometimes I wonder--

1:02:26.990 --> 1:02:28.230
(clattering)

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:30.362
- Midnight approaches.

1:02:30.410 --> 1:02:33.117
In the time-honored
tradition for the ladies,

1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:36.288
please prepare for
the Cinderella waltz.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:40.708
- What? Do you
think I'm too old?

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.829
(ballroom music)

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:02.896
- Royal toast?

1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.704
- You're acting very
strangely. Is something wrong?

1:03:23.630 --> 1:03:25.757
- Do you really have
to be home by midnight?

1:03:26.970 --> 1:03:29.211
- Oh, my neck.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.757
Help me, I'm 200 years old!

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:34.799
Give me your hand.

1:03:34.850 --> 1:03:36.010
- Sorry, sorry.

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:37.971
(creaking)

1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:38.930
- What is this?

1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:40.049
- Royal toast.

1:03:42.690 --> 1:03:43.975
Feel free, please take one.

1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:45.396
Royal toast.

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:55.909
(ominous music)

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:04.241
- Here, this must be
the way to the ballroom.

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:08.710
- You know what,
that's not locked,

1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:10.000
there's something
leaning against it.

1:04:10.050 --> 1:04:11.631
- All right, well we're
running out of time.

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:12.578
Push.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:13.959
(they grunt)

1:04:20.730 --> 1:04:22.345
- Rargh!

1:04:23.650 --> 1:04:26.107
Skin 'em. Skin 'em alive!

1:04:26.150 --> 1:04:27.310
- Oh!

1:04:33.370 --> 1:04:35.440
Back in the hall,
90, 90, 90, 90-

1:04:36.870 --> 1:04:38.155
(clattering)

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:43.917
- Oh, no it's locked.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:47.626
Here, here, wait, wait, wait.

1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:53.926
- All right look, this
is gonna take too long.

1:04:53.970 --> 1:04:55.847
You just keep going, and
I'm gonna fight them off.

1:04:55.890 --> 1:04:56.879
- No, dad, you're
gonna get killed.

1:04:56.930 --> 1:04:58.306
- It doesn't matter about me.

1:04:58.350 --> 1:04:59.806
You have to save everybody,
all right? Just go!

1:04:59.850 --> 1:05:01.841
And if you get through, just
keep going, don't wait for me.

1:05:01.890 --> 1:05:02.720
I'll keep guard.

1:05:06.020 --> 1:05:10.229
(fanfare)

1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:20.577
- If none questions
his appointment,

1:05:20.620 --> 1:05:22.201
then I do solemnly--

1:05:22.250 --> 1:05:23.740
- Wait.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:29.789
I question.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:31.467
- Woof. Oh, um...

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:35.678
Uh, do you?

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.133
- Are you really
Prince Wendell White?

1:05:40.810 --> 1:05:43.381
Grandson of Snow White?

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:46.147
The man who would be king?

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:51.681
-Iam”.

1:06:07.170 --> 1:06:08.080
- Hey!

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:11.870
- Uh oh.

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:17.670
- No.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.927
(gasping)

1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:23.761
(gasping)

1:06:28.270 --> 1:06:29.601
Iam...

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.812
Iam...

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:38.366
Ordinary.

1:06:38.410 --> 1:06:43.154
(grunting)

1:06:52.170 --> 1:06:55.048
- I will never be
great like Snow White.

1:06:56.760 --> 1:06:58.921
Some are born to be great,

1:06:58.970 --> 1:07:02.007
but I am a pack animal.

1:07:04.270 --> 1:07:08.183
I am not a leader,
I am a retriever.

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:12.978
(shouting)

1:07:21.910 --> 1:07:23.480
(clattering)

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:27.533
(dramatic music)

1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:35.337
I do not want the job.

1:07:36.970 --> 1:07:38.005
I will not take the job.

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:43.798
I am not worthy.

1:07:47.270 --> 1:07:51.183
(shouting and grunting)

1:07:55.940 --> 1:07:57.100
- Looks painful.

1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:18.085
- He passed the third test.
He has shown humility.

1:08:19.590 --> 1:08:20.796
Bravo.

1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:23.422
(clapping)

1:08:25.970 --> 1:08:28.803
- He has passed the three tests,

1:08:28.850 --> 1:08:31.683
now let him be crowned.

1:08:31.730 --> 1:08:36.019
(fanfare)

1:08:56.840 --> 1:08:57.795
- Ow.

1:08:59.630 --> 1:09:00.540
- [Tony] Virginia!

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:06.798
(chanting)

1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:14.761
- You only get to watch.

1:09:15.900 --> 1:09:17.436
- [Audience] Aww.

1:09:22.780 --> 1:09:24.987
- Time for the royal
toast, your majesty.

1:09:29.910 --> 1:09:31.821
- [Man] The royal toast!

1:09:32.830 --> 1:09:34.707
- To everlasting peace,

1:09:36.590 --> 1:09:39.912
and all the bones we can gnaw.

1:09:41.340 --> 1:09:45.925
- To everlasting peace, and
all the bones we can gnaw?

1:09:58.860 --> 1:10:00.396
- I think I did really well.

1:10:05.910 --> 1:10:10.233
(coughing and gagging)

1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:22.331
- Ugh, poison.

1:10:37.730 --> 1:10:39.641
- Anyone for seconds?

1:10:43.070 --> 1:10:44.025
No?

1:11:02.460 --> 1:11:04.758
- You certainly are persistent.

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:11.545
- Are you gonna kill me as well?

1:11:12.850 --> 1:11:16.229
- I was going to let you
go. I don't know why--

1:11:16.270 --> 1:11:18.090
- You know why.

1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:22.429
- Go, leave me, get
out while you can.

1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:23.640
- No.

1:11:27.950 --> 1:11:30.612
- You were nothing
but an accident.

1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:32.616
You should have been
killed at birth.

1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:38.956
- How dare you.

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.878
How dare you speak
to me like that?

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:43.035
- Kill her now.

1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:48.461
Ki|| her, or I'll do it myself.

1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:51.385
- Noo!

1:11:51.430 --> 1:11:52.545
- [Virginia] Wolf!

1:12:02.190 --> 1:12:03.259
- Stop.

1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:21.575
- Cripes.

1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:31.462
(she coughs)

1:12:40.270 --> 1:12:42.807
- You've drawn blood.

1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:45.146
- I'm sorry.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.797
- No, no!

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.870
No, please don't die.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.831
Don't die.

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:15.007
Just remember who you are.

1:13:16.890 --> 1:13:18.050
- It's too late.

1:13:23.270 --> 1:13:27.104
Don't cry, my little girl.

1:13:35.910 --> 1:13:37.821
I gave away my soul.

1:13:42.830 --> 1:13:44.286
- Wait! Wait!

1:13:45.750 --> 1:13:46.739
Wait!

1:13:49.050 --> 1:13:52.793
(she sobs)

1:14:06.230 --> 1:14:07.265
- Oh my god.

1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:13.106
What happened?

1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.743
- Oh, oh, I think I've
drunk too much champagne.

1:14:24.290 --> 1:14:27.953
- Oh, oh, what's
happening? What's going on?

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.663
(groaning)

1:14:31.710 --> 1:14:33.962
- Why aren't you all dead?

1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:47.221
- I thought you
poisoned everybody.

1:14:47.270 --> 1:14:49.431
- Oh, no, no, no,
no. Troll dust.

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:52.187
I swapped the poison for
a pinch of troll dust

1:14:52.230 --> 1:14:53.811
just to make it look convincing.

1:14:56.910 --> 1:14:59.526
I'm sorry, I had to trick you.

1:14:59.570 --> 1:15:01.367
Go for it, Wendy.

1:15:01.410 --> 1:15:02.399
Go.

1:15:08.830 --> 1:15:10.536
That ought to do the trick.

1:15:22.010 --> 1:15:23.341
- Ah.

1:15:24.810 --> 1:15:26.220
(barking)

1:15:26.270 --> 1:15:29.808
- I'm back, I'm back.

1:15:33.650 --> 1:15:35.186
I'm back!

1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:39.449
(cheering)

1:16:19.450 --> 1:16:20.599
- Hi.

1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:24.987
I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

1:16:25.030 --> 1:16:27.248
You've been asleep
for almost two days.

1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:32.452
- I don't think I
realized how tired I was.

1:16:42.010 --> 1:16:43.671
What have I done?

1:16:46.850 --> 1:16:48.465
- It's not your fault.

1:16:49.810 --> 1:16:51.437
Don't blame yourself.

1:16:54.060 --> 1:16:55.266
Because that...

1:16:58.030 --> 1:16:59.315
- My destiny.

1:17:01.070 --> 1:17:02.276
- Oh, Virginia.

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:13.109
Let her go.

1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:15.706
- [Virginia] No...

1:17:17.420 --> 1:17:21.959
- [Announcer] Lords and
ladies, girls and boys,

1:17:22.010 --> 1:17:26.253
let's hear it for King Wendell!

1:17:27.430 --> 1:17:31.799
(clapping and cheering)

1:17:37.020 --> 1:17:40.854
- And now, for the greatest
bravery imaginable,

1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:45.109
for courage in the face of
relentless and terrible danger,

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:47.981
I award my dear friends

1:17:48.030 --> 1:17:50.533
the highest medals
in my kingdom.

1:17:50.580 --> 1:17:54.289
(clapping)

1:17:54.330 --> 1:17:58.835
Firstly, my temporary
manservant, Anthony.

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:02.793
(clapping)

1:18:05.090 --> 1:18:06.887
My people, look upon my friend.

1:18:08.390 --> 1:18:11.712
No longer is he spineless
and wallowing in self pity.

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:12.976
- Thanks.

1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:16.183
- No longer is he a
balding, useless coward

1:18:16.230 --> 1:18:17.936
who'd rather run than fight.

1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:20.687
No longer is he selfishly driven

1:18:20.730 --> 1:18:23.949
by envy and greed, no.

1:18:26.450 --> 1:18:28.691
He is heroically transformed.

1:18:30.990 --> 1:18:34.118
What braver man could exist

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:37.539
than Anthony the Valiant.

1:18:37.580 --> 1:18:39.707
(fanfare)

1:18:39.750 --> 1:18:43.754
(clapping)

1:18:46.550 --> 1:18:49.212
For this long-suffering dog,

1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:52.388
my craftsmen have made
a special collar medal.

1:18:53.810 --> 1:18:58.304
This confused canine will
live in a golden kennel

1:18:58.350 --> 1:19:01.899
next to his very own
mountain of bones.

1:19:01.940 --> 1:19:06.445
(fanfare)

1:19:07.740 --> 1:19:09.731
Perhaps it's better
if I don't touch him.

1:19:11.370 --> 1:19:12.860
You never know
what might happen.

1:19:12.910 --> 1:19:14.400
(laughing)

1:19:14.450 --> 1:19:17.669
(fanfare)

1:19:17.710 --> 1:19:20.167
(clapping)

1:19:20.210 --> 1:19:23.418
As for this wolf,

1:19:23.460 --> 1:19:27.419
for him, I have no medal.

1:19:29.510 --> 1:19:32.718
- Huff puff. That's typical.

1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:37.129
- Instead, I have
here a royal pardon

1:19:37.190 --> 1:19:40.182
for all wolves, everywhere
throughout my kingdom.

1:19:41.650 --> 1:19:46.314
From now on, wolves
will be known as heroes,

1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:50.353
for it was a noble wolf who
saved the nine kingdoms.

1:19:50.410 --> 1:19:53.618
(fanfare)

1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:55.150
- That's wolves for ya!

1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:56.827
Good guys!

1:19:56.870 --> 1:19:58.360
- As for Virginia,

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:04.338
how can I ever reward you
for what you have done.

1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:06.200
For what you have lost.

1:20:10.340 --> 1:20:12.752
This flower was given
to me by Snow White

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:15.052
when I was seven years old

1:20:15.100 --> 1:20:17.477
on the day she left
our castle forever.

1:20:19.310 --> 1:20:23.144
She said that one day,
I would meet her again,

1:20:24.770 --> 1:20:26.146
though she would never return.

1:20:28.820 --> 1:20:30.811
I understand her words now.

1:20:34.530 --> 1:20:38.864
(slow music)

1:20:50.470 --> 1:20:53.132
- When I was a little
girl, you had a fur coat.

1:20:54.890 --> 1:20:57.632
And I remember you used
to come in my room and,

1:20:59.390 --> 1:21:01.597
and I could still
smell your perfume.

1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:10.696
And you used to rub the
fur up and down my cheek,

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:15.059
and I knew,

1:21:16.700 --> 1:21:19.032
I knew that you really,
really loved me.

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:28.491
I always wanted to
be your little girl.

1:21:54.570 --> 1:21:56.526
- Anthony, I wish
to offer you a job.

1:21:58.280 --> 1:21:59.531
- No thanks.

1:21:59.580 --> 1:22:01.821
- Oh, no, but wait until
you hear what it is.

1:22:01.870 --> 1:22:04.703
I want you to build
me a new castle.

1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:07.490
- A ca--

1:22:07.540 --> 1:22:09.167
I'm no architect.

1:22:09.210 --> 1:22:11.758
- No, no, no, a bouncy castle.

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:16.509
I will give you titles, land,
and hundreds of servants,

1:22:16.550 --> 1:22:18.506
whatever you need.

1:22:18.550 --> 1:22:21.678
- That's very, um,
your majesty, I can't.

1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:25.645
I mean, I, well, I can't
even make plastic over here.

1:22:25.690 --> 1:22:27.305
It's basically what
you're asking me to do

1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:30.727
is give you an
industrial revolution.

1:22:31.860 --> 1:22:33.851
- In your new position,

1:22:33.900 --> 1:22:35.561
you'll be surrounded
by young beauties

1:22:35.610 --> 1:22:39.068
in all of your reputation
as a national hero.

1:22:49.710 --> 1:22:52.247
- Oh! Miss, miss, over here.

1:23:03.890 --> 1:23:05.721
What would you like to eat?

1:23:05.770 --> 1:23:06.839
- Um-—

1:23:06.890 --> 1:23:08.266
- Hey, you've gotta
eat something.

1:23:08.310 --> 1:23:09.800
- Yeah, you've
gotta eat something.

1:23:11.900 --> 1:23:13.356
- Okay, I'll have, um,

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:14.936
I'll have some fish.

1:23:14.990 --> 1:23:17.527
- Fish. Fish, fish, yes, fish.

1:23:17.570 --> 1:23:18.776
Waiter? Waiter?

1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:21.277
Bring fresh fish
immediately, please.

1:23:21.330 --> 1:23:22.615
Fresh fish.

1:23:24.410 --> 1:23:25.115
- Thank you.

1:23:25.160 --> 1:23:25.785
- Thank you.

1:23:25.830 --> 1:23:26.819
-Mmm.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.793
- I'm fine, really.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.046
- She's fine, really.

1:23:41.550 --> 1:23:44.804
How I long to linger

1:23:44.850 --> 1:23:48.138
on your sweetheart's finger.

1:23:48.190 --> 1:23:49.179
- What?

1:23:49.230 --> 1:23:50.970
- That's my engagement ring.

1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:54.808
Oh, and, a singing ring
never fails to get his girl.

1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:55.929
- Ahh.

1:23:55.990 --> 1:23:57.855
- It's destiny.

1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.948
- Put it on, put it on.

1:23:59.990 --> 1:24:01.776
Well, all right,
I'll just try it on.

1:24:01.820 --> 1:24:03.026
But I'm not getting married.

1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:05.537
- Of course you are, a
baby's got to have a father.

1:24:05.580 --> 1:24:08.401
- I don't intend to have any
children, thank you very much.

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:11.497
- Well, it's a little
bit late for that.

1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:13.588
- What do you mean?

1:24:13.630 --> 1:24:15.871
- You've got a little wolf
cub growing inside of you.

1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:20.583
A little furry chap, just
like me, only much smaller.

1:24:20.630 --> 1:24:24.714
Believe me, I'm a wolf,
I know these things.

1:24:25.810 --> 1:24:27.550
- Really?

1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:29.010
- I just know.

1:24:32.610 --> 1:24:35.647
There's no doubt,
and there's no maybe,

1:24:35.690 --> 1:24:39.854
the three of us
are having a baby.

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:41.197
Yippee!

1:24:46.540 --> 1:24:48.280
- That's where I went.

1:24:55.710 --> 1:24:57.291
- Are you really gonna stay?

1:24:57.340 --> 1:25:01.458
- Yeah. What, I gotta go back
to New York to be a janitor?

1:25:01.510 --> 1:25:04.968
Hey, remember, I'm still
wanted for armed robbery too.

1:25:05.010 --> 1:25:07.342
I'll stay a few weeks,
then I'll come back.

1:25:12.810 --> 1:25:14.721
- I'll see you soon, okay?

1:25:19.740 --> 1:25:21.731
I really love you, daddy.

1:25:24.820 --> 1:25:27.152
- You haven't called me daddy
since you were a little girl.

1:25:32.250 --> 1:25:34.536
- Really?

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:35.706
- Yeah.

1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:42.876
- See you soon, grandpa.

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:45.846
- Grandpa?

1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:11.036
- [Virginia] I'd like
to say that Wolf and I

1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:13.321
lived happily ever after,

1:26:13.370 --> 1:26:15.577
but our_lives were almost
immediately interrupted

1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:17.702
by another crisis
in the kingdoms.

1:26:23.050 --> 1:26:25.211
But that's not this story.

1:26:25.260 --> 1:26:27.330
This story is done.

1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:35.588
And, when you live every
day with all your heart,

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:38.552
and you can be happy ever after,

1:26:38.610 --> 1:26:40.646
even if it's only
for a short time.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:48.609
My name is Virginia, and I
live on the edge of the forest,

1:26:49.830 --> 1:26:54.324
and this is the end of the
first book of the tenth kingdom.

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.719
I'm wishing on a star

1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:16.474
to follow where you are.

1:27:18.810 --> 1:27:23.065
I'm wishing on a dream

1:27:25.570 --> 1:27:30.064
to follow what it means.

1:27:32.580 --> 1:27:36.653
And I wish on all the rainbows

1:27:36.710 --> 1:27:39.076
that I've seen.

1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:41.873
I wish on all the people

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:45.629
who really dream.

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:55.678
I'm wishing on a star.
