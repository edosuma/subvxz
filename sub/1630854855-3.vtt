You've increased your order
twice already in a year.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.400
Never trust a dirty cop.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.080
If you're really not sure you can
trust her, then test her.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.040
The lab have pulled a late print
from the Thomas Ajazi crime scene.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.440
From someone linked to McHugh?

00:12.440 --> 00:14.440
Enough to have a run at
the man himself.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.200
Leeds Station, Platform 12.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.080
She turned up, but ran off
before making the drop.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.920
Going to need you to do
something for me.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.800
Something not very nice.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.040
So, quit the force.
That's what I were going to do.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.600
But then, I'm just running away.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.720
And he gets to stays exactly
where he is.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.880
But would he be where
he is today without you?

00:32.880 --> 00:34.200
He's got to go down.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.960
Ha gave me a load of flannel about
how he needs a woman to deliver it,

00:41.960 --> 00:44.680
someone he can trust.
He's testing me.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.320
So, deliver it.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.800
If you want to bring him down,

00:48.800 --> 00:50.880
you're going to need to
keep him on side.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.600
What is it, anyroad?
Cash, he says.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.080
But it's sealed.
If I open it, he'll know.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.160
I take it you honed this technique
in the evidence room?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.600
Helped me sustain a pretty
respectable cocaine habit

01:05.600 --> 01:07.320
in the early '90s.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.520
DING

01:08.520 --> 01:10.480
He can't know
it's been tampered with.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.960
Don't panic.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.280
Well, I think it's fair to say
he doesn't entirely trust you.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.480
And if you're serious about
taking him down,

01:32.480 --> 01:34.840
you're going to need him to.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.440
You need to deliver it.

the other day?

Er, mate, turn around.
turn around, it's closed.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.600
Sorry. We can't put our hands
on that amount of white.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.320
But...if you want to
move into brown?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.640

Mehmet, but they do sort of

03:55.640 --> 03:57.600

03:57.600 --> 03:59.040
I wish I could help.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.000
But, er, why not just up your order?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.440
Can't. Can't give us any more.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.320
Bad crop. Climate change thing.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.680
Col, make the jump.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.400
You won't regret it.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.720
I'll think about it. Cheers, Mehmet.

You got a problem with that?

04:23.880 --> 04:27.280
Now, you want to risk
the peace in Bradford? It's...

04:27.280 --> 04:29.360
It's what? Go on.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.640
It's reckless.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.000
And it's not like you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.400
Oh? Tell me what I'm like, then.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.800
I'd really love
to fucking hear that.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.280
You're careful.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.800
Uh-huh.  Or you were.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.840
Until...recently.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.760
That's fair enough.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.480
You're entitled to hear an
explanation.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.000
So here it is.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.960
I want to do this...

05:03.960 --> 05:06.840
..because it's what I want
to fuckin' do.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.400

for a wander.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.720
You off to see Col?

06:05.720 --> 06:07.040
Yeah.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.680
Why lie?

06:16.040 --> 06:19.960
Are you going to tell him
that you're resigning?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.920
Maybe.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.720
But that is not going to be
an easy conversation to have.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.440
Can, er, you drop Owen at his
next thing, then I'll pick him up?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.400

07:03.960 --> 07:06.720
Appreciate it, more than you know.
No worries.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.040
Listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.440
What do you know about
Jimmy Erskine?  Erm...

07:12.800 --> 07:16.080
Major rat poison importer.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.920
Supplies the Maliks.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.720
Biggest gang in Bradford.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.440
We're doing a wee bit of business
with him in Bradford Friday night.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.680
OK, do the Maliks know?  No.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.960
So, we're going in on tippy-toes.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.720
Be good to know if he's being
watched by your lot, y'know?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.800
Well, that'd be Bradford, not us.
Right, well, can you find out?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.440
Not without them
asking why I'm asking.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.040

07:41.040 --> 07:42.640
Yeah.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.920
I get it, I get it.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.520
Will you get him something from me?
Could you do that?

07:54.520 --> 07:56.600
Artem'll give you the money...
Oh, no, no.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.840
Just something he loves...
No, Col, we're all sorted.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.160

09:57.480 --> 09:59.360
I've got an idea how to get at Col.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.440
He's got some business in Bradford
on Friday, with a supplier

10:02.440 --> 10:04.960
called Jimmy Erskine.
Sounds like a deal.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.600
He told me to check
if he were being looked at.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.360
If I tip off Bradford, they do
extra surveillance on Jimmy.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.000
Start an investigation -
that could lead to Col.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.840
That's a punt-and-a-half.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.880
If a deal does go down, they'll just
nick 'em all to pad the stats.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.080
No, but at least he loses manpower,
cash, drugs. It's a start.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.720
No-one's going to mount
surveillance on a phoned-in tip.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.840
Need a proper informant,
to sell the story.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.440
Oh, sod off.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.120
My head would be on a spike above
the door before I could speak.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.520
You must know someone?

10:38.520 --> 10:39.920
Er...

10:42.600 --> 10:45.480
Someone  I could go and see.
A Bradford face.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.160
Did a lot of work for me
back in the day.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.720
She'll want quite
the sweetener, mind.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.520
You know I'm good for it.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.120
Leave it with me.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.640
Why you helping me, Vern?

10:56.640 --> 10:58.160
Summat to do.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.400
Right, three threads
that can lead to McHugh.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.880
Thread one -
the Hyde Park cannabis farm.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.120
Est'?  A few hours after the raid,
a semi in Morley and a lock-up

11:11.120 --> 11:14.400
in Wykebeck were cleared out.
Front doors swinging in the breeze.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.080
I mean, both properties
clearly being used as grows,

11:17.080 --> 11:18.480
similar set-ups.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.240
Yeah, well, that reeks of McHugh.
No-one else is that disciplined.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.320
Right. But nothing
we can tie back to him yet.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.160
I mean, we've got the two minors
we found at the property,

11:26.160 --> 11:28.480
but it seems it all went
through their gang boss.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.720
And they never saw anyone else
leave the house.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.480
I mean, I'm talking to Border Force
to trace the trafficker, but...

11:33.480 --> 11:34.760
It were worth a try.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.720
Thread number two is a Noel Wilkes.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.800
Now, as embarrassing as it is
for me to discuss that daring and

11:40.800 --> 11:44.920
heroic arrest, it is my opinion
that Noel is never going to flip.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.360
Like most of McHugh's people,
he's loyal.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.280
And that's why this task force
has its work cut out.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.000
McHugh keeps his crew
small and tight.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.800
He imports, processes,
and wholesales to other gangs,

11:55.800 --> 11:58.200
so someone else shoulders
the risk of street dealing.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.680
Everything's at arm's length,

11:59.680 --> 12:02.360
which is why it's 12 years
since his last conviction.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.800
The last time he were in court,

12:03.800 --> 12:06.360
the NCA brought an Unexplained
Wealth Order against him,

12:06.360 --> 12:07.560
that were three year ago.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.160
Not only did the bugger beat it,

12:09.160 --> 12:11.360
his lawyers got a formal
apology out of 'em.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.720
Well, if he's so untouchable,
why are we even bothering?

12:13.720 --> 12:16.520
Because 70% of the cocaine
in this city flows through him.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.280
The sheer scale of the damage
that he is responsible for...

12:23.960 --> 12:27.360
Gossip is - McHugh's been
stepping up activities recently.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.720
Getting more aggressive
with other groups,

12:29.720 --> 12:31.560
pushing into new territory.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.720
He's also apparently investing a lot
more on the legit property side.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.840
But why the change in pattern?
It's hard to say.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.240
There's not much on him personally,
but his daughter...

12:42.240 --> 12:48.400
..er...Aoife topped herself
year before last.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.880
Overdose.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.320
The Coroner reported
an open verdict.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.080
Right. Well, regardless, either way,

12:54.080 --> 12:56.000
he took his eye off the ball
for a few weeks.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.440
Product stopped flowing.

12:57.440 --> 13:01.520
Competitors moved in, until he came
roaring back with a vengeance.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.200
And he hasn't looked back since.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.840
I mean, we do all grieve
differently, eh?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.960
HE CHUCKLES

13:07.960 --> 13:10.640
Erm, thread number three -
Thomas Ajazi.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.240
The kid found in the pub, Phil?

13:12.240 --> 13:13.840
Harrison Sprewell.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.480
The prime suspect in the murder is
still on his toes in southern Spain.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.840
But we do have a tasty new titbit.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.360
This partial footprint
in the blood has unusually

13:26.360 --> 13:29.600
poor definition around the edges
and on the tread.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.320
Now FSI are used to seeing that.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.280
So, their own prints come up off
a scene when wearing shoe covers.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.320
And so, they had another look -
and realised the blood pooling

13:37.320 --> 13:39.560
dates this print to the
time of death.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.760
Now why would Sprewell
wear blue shoes and

13:41.760 --> 13:42.960
not bother with gloves?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.240
This isn't Sprewell.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.120
His mam confirmed he's 6'1",
size 12.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.880
These are much smaller.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.720
We have a second person
at the scene.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.880
What'd you reckon, Lou? Think it
could've been a planned hit?

13:59.040 --> 14:01.200
Maybe.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.640
S...sorry I think that...

14:03.640 --> 14:05.920
Oh, it's m-my husband.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.320
Might be about me son.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.160

16:05.000 --> 16:08.520
That's not the corpse

16:08.520 --> 16:10.320
Nice to see you too, Lynny.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.120
Have you got a sec?  I'm retired.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.440
This is my shop now.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.600
You even in working order?

16:20.760 --> 16:23.000
It's just a chat I'm after.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.800
Come on.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.120
Don't mind me, just picking up
the granddaughter.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.120
Oh, this is nice. Bijou feel.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.680
Aye, aye.  Don't take the piss.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.360
It's mine - and it's safe.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.240
Safe?  I'm looked after.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.120
You come to grovel?  Eh?

Yep. That sounds about right.

No favours, no freebies.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.240
This favour's paid. Well paid.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.800
Go on.  I need you to go into
Bradford nick with a tip.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.800
Today. Make 'em listen.
They know you.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.640
That's quite the favour.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.560
What's the tip?  Jimmy Erskine.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.200
Col McHugh's lot are coming to do

17:25.200 --> 17:27.720

I thought you could tell 'em one
of your clients blurted it

17:30.640 --> 17:32.920

17:32.920 --> 17:35.560
Dropping some big names there, Vern.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.760
Dangerous names.  500.

Half now, half later.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.720

17:42.720 --> 17:44.680

17:44.680 --> 17:46.720
And another after.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.120
Sort of people you're talking about,
I reckon it's worth it.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.160
So, your mum's got some big news.
Oh, Cer, can we not?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.400
What is it?

17:59.400 --> 18:01.240
I don't need chivvying along, ta.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.880
Mum, what is it?

18:04.440 --> 18:07.720
I've been thinking about
quitting my job.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.200
But I'm not going to.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.320
Not for the time being, at least.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.800
OK. Wow.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.360
Well, what's changed your mind?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.760
Er, stability. Continuity.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.000
I don't know, maybe thinking
I could actually do some good.  OK.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.120
What? It is possible, you know?

18:25.760 --> 18:29.400
There's some good coppers out there
trying to do the right thing.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.200
And a few bad apples, too.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.520
I changed my mind, OK?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.240
And I don't appreciate
being smoked out.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.320
But you said you couldn't
work for Col any more.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.640
That you were ready to chuck
your career away to stop.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.160
And now you're staying? Just like
that? What...what's changed?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.400
He wouldn't be where
he is today without me.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.760
If I quit, he just keeps doing it.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.880
So what?  So, I can't have that!
It's wrong.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.320
And you've only just realised this?
Yeah, and I'm going to do summat.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.880
What like? Confess?

18:57.880 --> 19:00.560
No, I can't be found out.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.160
Well, what, then?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.440
I promise, I will always
keep us safe.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.200
You can't promise that, Lou,
because it sounds as if you're

19:07.200 --> 19:09.400
talking about stabbing him
in the back!

19:09.400 --> 19:12.200

very bloody safe to me.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.760
THEY LAUGH And what did you do?!

19:27.760 --> 19:29.320
I didn't do anything.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.880
Casino lads, you know, they might've
done something, but I didn't ask.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.880
I wasn't feeling that concerned for
his welfare by that point, y'know?

19:37.800 --> 19:44.000

boring most of these dinners are.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.080
But, er, speaking of paying out,

19:47.080 --> 19:50.040
I suppose we'd better talk business
for at least five minutes.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.040
Aye, well, make it three

Good.  ..happy days!  Good.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.680
And, erm, the Sheffield development?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.760
Well, erm...

20:07.760 --> 20:12.960
..the feeling is, we'd love ya
to be onboard in Sheffield.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.960
But...it's a much bigger
project than your own,

20:16.960 --> 20:22.160
and there are other institutional
investors who, erm...

20:22.160 --> 20:27.160
Well,  they might not feel entirely
comfortable working with you.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.640
Oh?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.000
I told you.

I told you.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.760
And why would that be, Howard?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.400
Do they think the Queen looks
the other way on my money, or what?

20:45.400 --> 20:48.520
No, no, it's, er...

20:48.520 --> 20:54.920
It's unfair, we know that,
but, erm, at this scale,

20:54.920 --> 20:58.960
there's a certain...optics problem.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.160
What optics problem?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.920
Like cataracts or something?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.720
No, what we mean is...

I know what you fucking mean!

Be brave.

into our home, OK?

21:27.360 --> 21:28.880

His name's James.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.480
He comes to the group
cos his girlfriend died.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.880
He didn't kill her -

46:02.960 --> 46:06.160
It's a dirty business, doing good.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.640
I'm not doing good.
I'm making things worse.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.200
You stopped a gang war.
Which I started.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.400
With a little help from you.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.480
Now, Mehmood Zada's in
a hospital bed.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.200
His son's in a cell.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.120
And if it weren't for me,
they'd both be at home.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.600
So, maybe you're right,
maybe there's no way out.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.160
No free way out, no.

46:27.120 --> 46:30.120
Say you did manage
to send McHugh down,

46:30.120 --> 46:31.680
and he never suspected you.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.240
What would you do, then?

46:34.680 --> 46:37.440
Go clean. Go straight.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.720
That settles the bill, does it?

46:39.720 --> 46:41.880
What do you mean?

46:41.880 --> 46:44.080
McHugh picks up the whole tab.

46:44.080 --> 46:46.440
You don't pay a penny.

46:46.440 --> 46:49.600
Well, I pay by shutting him down
and risking everything to do it.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.600
Pull it off, though,
you'll come out golden.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.600
No confessing to your own crimes.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.720
Well, what would you call 'em?

46:57.720 --> 46:59.840
I thought all confession
was selfish?

46:59.840 --> 47:01.640
Here's what I think.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.400
You reckon you get rid of Col,
and your guilt goes with him.

47:04.400 --> 47:05.800
But I'm not so sure.

47:07.480 --> 47:09.800
You're trying to make a deal
with your own conscience.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.080
But the conscience
doesn't negotiate.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.960
Tell me this, Vern,
if you're so wise,

47:14.960 --> 47:17.680
how come you let your pal in
Bradford sell us out?

47:19.560 --> 47:21.640
Well, I'm only a carrier of wisdom.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.600
I don't suffer from the
condition myself.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.080
I should go.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.240
CAT MEOWS

47:52.200 --> 47:54.040
She pulled it off.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.600
Maliks are off the street.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.320
Still think we should've hit 'em.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.800
Need me for this?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.400
No.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.240
Love these houses.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.680
Col!

48:23.240 --> 48:25.520
I was going to call you.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.840
About the dinner the other night,
we didn't mean to...

48:27.840 --> 48:30.120
What kind of stone is that?

48:30.120 --> 48:33.080
Er...I don't know, actually.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.800
Listen, I know what the gossip is.

48:39.800 --> 48:42.000
I get where it comes from, y'know?

48:45.320 --> 48:49.640
I've committed the heinous crime
of being an outsider who's done...

48:49.640 --> 48:51.040
..a wee bit OK for himself.

48:51.040 --> 48:54.440
And, granted, when I was young,
I was a very silly boy.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.600
But say that it was all true.

49:01.240 --> 49:05.320
Say I really was all those things
that people say that I am.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.680
Did I choose to be?

49:07.680 --> 49:10.000
Do any of us choose?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.280
We're made the way we're made,
aren't we?

49:12.280 --> 49:15.320
And we get stuck...
where we get stuck.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.920
You didn't choose to be this,
did you, Howard?

49:20.920 --> 49:23.640
You didn't choose to be
a soft-bellied, limp-dicked,

49:23.640 --> 49:26.680
sweaty little bean-counter whose
own wife must despise him?

49:29.280 --> 49:33.280
How often does she let you get
your thunder-thigh over, Howard?

49:33.280 --> 49:35.960
Strictly Valentine's
and birthdays, am I close?

49:44.600 --> 49:47.080
We never chose to be
the people that we are.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.400
But we get punished for being
them, anyway, y'know?

49:55.520 --> 49:58.920
Col, let me talk to
the other partners. Possibly...

49:58.920 --> 50:02.320
You do what you think's right,
Howard. You search your heart.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.920
OK.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.800
It's a cracking house though,
really.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.560
You got plenty of smoke alarms?

50:13.560 --> 50:17.040
They just need checking
regularly, though, right?

50:17.040 --> 50:19.600
Batteries run down quicker
than you think.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.840
Evening.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.240
You haven't told me how
your day went.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.840
That's right, I didn't.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.560
Come on, I'm trying here, love.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.400
I don't know what you want from me.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.680
I want you to treat me
like an adult.

50:50.680 --> 50:53.520
I want you to accept
what's happened.

50:53.520 --> 50:56.920
And I want you to be honest with me.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.880
Well, OK.

50:59.880 --> 51:03.440
It's quite a list of things
to work through.  Hmm.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.320
Can I see?

51:11.400 --> 51:13.680
Is this you dead?

51:13.680 --> 51:15.200
I might just be sleeping?

51:15.200 --> 51:16.920
No, I've seen enough bodies.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.920
How many?  Too many.

51:22.400 --> 51:23.960
What they like?

51:25.880 --> 51:27.720
Smaller than alive ones.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.240
Sad.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.680
Sort of crumpled.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.440
Do you think about them a lot?

51:37.440 --> 51:39.320
No.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.120
See, I just asked you to be honest.

51:43.240 --> 51:46.040
OK. Fine, yeah.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.840
I do think about them.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.640
One in particular.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.040
What happened?

51:55.360 --> 51:56.600
Don't matter.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.880
Who were they?

52:09.160 --> 52:11.000
You know I can't tell you that.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.280
Try and get some sleep, OK?

52:54.920 --> 52:56.360
LOUD KNOCK AT DOOR

52:56.360 --> 52:57.960
DOORBELL

53:07.160 --> 53:09.840
Those kids from
the weed farm disappeared.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.360
About two hours ago.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.720
They got hold of a phone,
messaged someone,

53:15.720 --> 53:18.480
went out a first-floor window,
got picked up.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.240
Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you really?

53:21.240 --> 53:22.760
'Course I am.

53:22.760 --> 53:26.280
You did the very best you
could for them.  Yeah, I agree.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.840
I did do my best for 'em -
and that's the problem.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.520
My "best" accomplished precisely
sod all, for God's sake.

53:33.560 --> 53:36.080
Forgive me.
Esther, trust me, you're good.

53:39.760 --> 53:43.200
I grew up ten minutes
from Shipcross.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.000
I loved it.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.680
The place, the people, everything.

53:50.920 --> 53:53.640
That's why I joined the force -
walking cliche, I know,

53:53.640 --> 53:58.840
but I thought I could change it
from within, make it better.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.040
What a joke.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.760
But it seemed simple at the start.

54:05.760 --> 54:09.560
Just be fair,
just treat people equal,

54:09.560 --> 54:11.360
everybody gets respect.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.640
And I've tried.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.760
I have.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.720
But week in, week out,

54:20.720 --> 54:24.840
I'm nicking the same lads on the
same streets for the same charges.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.520
A lot of 'em with names like mine.

54:26.520 --> 54:30.240
I'm not fighting crime,
I'm manning a bloody turnstile.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.240
Look, we can't change the law.

54:32.240 --> 54:34.120
But we can put a human face on it.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.440
Why put a human face on
something I know is broken?

54:37.440 --> 54:39.040
Every week that goes by,

54:39.040 --> 54:41.440
it gets harder to tell myself
there's any point.

54:41.440 --> 54:44.000
Look, shall we go sit on the sofa
and talk about it properly...?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.880
No, no, I didn't come
to talk about me.

55:00.760 --> 55:03.440
Where do you go?  What'd you mean?

55:03.440 --> 55:06.000
I mean, where are ya?

55:06.000 --> 55:07.560
You're never at your desk.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.000
You skip meetings.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.600
Forever disappearing, dashing off,
on your own, off the grid.

55:12.600 --> 55:15.560
I mean, you've always got
a great-sounding reason.

55:15.560 --> 55:19.680
And no-one's complaining,
you're the best in the unit, but...

55:19.680 --> 55:21.680
..where do you go?

55:22.800 --> 55:26.160
You can't police this city from
an ergonomic chair, Esther.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.640
That's a nice line.

55:31.640 --> 55:33.200
You have so many.

55:36.880 --> 55:40.040
I've gone through
50 different explanations.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.280
Told myself that I saw it wrong.

55:43.280 --> 55:46.000
That I imagined it.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.640
But then, I started thinking,
why am I trying so hard

55:49.640 --> 55:51.600
to explain away what I know I saw?

55:53.160 --> 55:55.120
You put the gear in the Maliks' car.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.920
What?  Don't even, Lou.  No, Esther...

55:56.920 --> 55:59.520
Why would you do that?
Whoa! Esther! No.

55:59.520 --> 56:03.800
Deny it again, and I go straight out
this door and go straight to Sandy.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.400
Why?

56:11.080 --> 56:13.400
Wait! Wait. Wait.

56:13.400 --> 56:15.400
Yes, I put the cocaine in the car.

56:16.720 --> 56:19.080
Why?  To stop a war.

56:19.080 --> 56:21.480
But, what war?

56:21.480 --> 56:23.000
McHugh and the Maliks made a deal.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Stay out of each other's cities.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.560
McHugh broke it, so the Maliks went
and beat up two of his men.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.160
McHugh were going to hit back.

56:31.160 --> 56:35.600
So, I planted the gear in his car
to protect everyone.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.200
But how would you even begin
to know any of that?

56:38.200 --> 56:39.840
That part, I can't tell ya.

56:43.160 --> 56:45.880
Esther! Esther!

56:54.840 --> 56:57.640
Get out, Lou...  Esther, just wait!

56:57.640 --> 56:58.960
SHE SIGHS

56:58.960 --> 57:01.520
I know all that because
I work for Col McHugh.

57:03.280 --> 57:04.800
I always have.
