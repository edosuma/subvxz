some actual gold

02:06.667 --> 02:08.500

02:08.567 --> 02:12.367

Right now,
the name of the game
is to get pay in the plant

09:07.967 --> 09:09.400
and to get gold in the box.

09:09.467 --> 09:13.266
If I can't get consistent
gold coming across
the sluice,

09:13.266 --> 09:15.367
I'm never going to hit
my 500-ounce goal.

if I can't pull this
season around,

09:35.567 --> 09:36.867
my mining career is over.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.467
I... I'm not going to be
able to continue.

09:38.467 --> 09:41.100
We've got some gold
in the box,
small gold weigh,

09:41.166 --> 09:43.100
but honestly,
it's not enough.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.800
So, we're going to pull
that pay from last season

09:44.867 --> 09:49.166
that's accessible
and get as much fed
to the plant as possible.

09:49.166 --> 09:54.367

11:00.000 --> 11:00.700
We're on the right track.

11:00.767 --> 11:01.000
My thinking process
is that we got all
our problems

11:04.000 --> 11:05.767
out of the way
in the beginning
of the season,

11:05.767 --> 11:09.166

to just work around
the clock

11:18.967 --> 11:20.367

as we can,

11:43.567 --> 11:45.367
Well, [bleep].

11:45.367 --> 11:47.367
I lost a [bleep] tooth.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.767
I broke a tooth right
off the bucket here.

12:02.467 --> 12:09.100
Now, I'll walk the machine
over sketchily off this pile
and try to fix it out the...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.266
[bleep] me.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.700

12:30.066 --> 12:31.000

on the tracks now,

one lost tooth, [bleep] no.

12:43.266 --> 12:45.000

12:51.367 --> 12:56.100

to lift this side
of the machine up,

12:56.166 --> 12:58.667
walk that track,
try to keep it straight,

12:58.667 --> 13:00.000
because I'm on top of a pile,
drop off on both sides.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000

to [bleep] open
the engine up,

20:55.300 --> 20:59.567

a rod in the engine,

Throw a rod,
it's not good,

Yeah, sometimes
what I do actually
turns out the way I plan.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.500
I knew it was gonna be
great after all [bleep]

27:25.567 --> 27:27.500

27:29.367 --> 27:31.367

[bleep] fantastic.

27:31.367 --> 27:32.900
It's going to be lovely.

27:34.367 --> 27:35.767

[Kevin] [bleep] yeah,
glad that is done,

28:28.667 --> 28:33.200
the siding is in
and there is no [bleep] hole,
so nothing can get out.

28:33.266 --> 28:34.900

28:34.967 --> 28:36.500

doing cleanups.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.166

we got a track off our 250,

29:33.166 --> 29:35.867

[narrator] <i>The Lewis Crew's</i>

30:02.100 --> 30:05.367
Having any vehicle down
for any given time,

30:05.367 --> 30:08.100
it slows down on anything,

30:08.100 --> 30:11.066
so having this one down
is a pretty big deal.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.467
So,
the broken part of the pin,

30:23.467 --> 30:27.166
in order to get it out,
we've got to actually
cut the darn thing out.

30:29.900 --> 30:33.467
Just get it done,
get it done as quick...
quickly as we can.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.767
As soon as I get that
darn bushing melted
out of there.

30:49.967 --> 30:53.066
When the pin breaks,
it shears it.

30:53.066 --> 30:56.800
I mean, the massive power
it takes to do that is crazy

30:56.867 --> 30:59.166

that's one thing
you're good at,

so...

33:12.166 --> 33:13.700
[laughs]

going up there and picking
it up and putting it on,

33:39.767 --> 33:43.100

we're not going to make
enough progress

36:22.266 --> 36:24.266

this year, so

36:48.700 --> 36:51.500
All right, guys,
see what you can do.
Hope it don't break.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.467
[Brandon] Straight on. Crazy.

37:05.467 --> 37:07.166
[bleep] easy there, buddy.

37:07.166 --> 37:08.567
[Brandon] Yeah, easy-peasy.

37:08.567 --> 37:09.767
Nice work, Brady.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.500
Because she's quite...
quite [bleep].

37:13.567 --> 37:15.967
It bends in and, like,
it waves.

37:20.166 --> 37:23.767
So, if we don't get it
straight, the belt's
going to walk, the...

37:23.767 --> 37:26.567
it's going to be hard
on the rollers, it's going
to be hard on the motor

37:26.567 --> 37:29.100
and which will just
give us constant problems.

37:30.467 --> 37:31.767
[John] I think what you do,

37:31.767 --> 37:34.000
where it just starts to bend,
you cut it there,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.800
you pull this
whole thing over,

37:35.867 --> 37:37.567
then you weld it when
that's straight,

37:37.567 --> 37:39.500
then you move over
to the next piece,

37:39.567 --> 37:42.767
you bend that into place,
you weld that.

37:57.967 --> 38:02.066

I think my confidence is 50%

38:02.066 --> 38:03.433
either way right now.

38:03.433 --> 38:07.867
Uh, I mean, this thing
is so bent in so many
different ways.

lipstick on a pig right now,

38:10.467 --> 38:15.066

to be straight, so.

[Brady] I wouldn't say
it's perfect,

39:28.467 --> 39:32.000
but I'm just going to finish
welding up the cuts
that we made,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.667

the belt on and see
if it runs straight or not.

has to pay the bills

[Brandon] And if we
think we're going

then we need to see progress,
progress, progress every week.

take our foot off the gas.

Things are looking up,
even though
we got to hold down,

45:28.967 --> 45:30.667
we're still full steam ahead.

45:30.667 --> 45:32.667
The conveyor
and feeder have worked,

45:32.667 --> 45:36.100
and it's putting us
in a better position
than last week.

45:36.166 --> 45:38.300
So, we're going
to keep moving forward,

45:38.367 --> 45:38.920

are uphill from here.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.000
