This is Johnny Phoenix for the XFL,,,

01:57.558 --> 02:02.018
,,,reminding fans here at Prudential
Stadium to be safe on the way home,

02:10.872 --> 02:13.340
Big third down
for the expansion Roadrunners.

02:13.541 --> 02:18.478
The playoff hopes hinge on this play.
A lot of pressure on Johnny Phoenix.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.480
As if being the first quarterback to
earn $300 million isn't enough.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.348
Red! Thirty-two!

02:29.323 --> 02:31.518
Red! Thirty-two!

02:33.995 --> 02:35.360
Run left!

02:40.501 --> 02:42.298
Blue! Two, thirty-nine!

02:43.371 --> 02:44.531
Blue!

02:53.881 --> 02:55.280
Hut!

03:20.374 --> 03:21.432
Get up, Johnny!

03:21.642 --> 03:22.768
You all right?

03:26.047 --> 03:28.038
The owner wants the best of care.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.082
He'll need it. His 6th cervical
vertebra is crushed.

03:31.285 --> 03:33.810
lt may not be as bad
as you think it is.

03:42.563 --> 03:46.431
The status? We have a lifetime
contract with a vegetable.

03:46.834 --> 03:48.802
Maybe we could trade him to L.A.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.998
Okay, l wantyou
to terminate his contract,

03:54.842 --> 03:55.831
Sure.

03:56.043 --> 03:57.271
l'll get right on it.

03:57.578 --> 04:01.275
Sorry, Johnny. You're going
to have to take one for the team.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.033
Do l look any different to you?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.104
Oh, gee.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.274
You shaved your mustache.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.876
l never had a mustache.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.803
Then, no.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.140
Johnny Phoenix will play next week,

04:37.351 --> 04:39.512
Early diagnosis had him sidelined,,,

04:39.720 --> 04:42.245
,,,but his injuries proved
to be minor,

04:42.590 --> 04:46.287
Good morning, Adam, At 11;00 you
have a VlP client, Michael Drucker,

04:46.494 --> 04:48.325
And by the way, happy birthday,

04:48.529 --> 04:49.860

04:51.265 --> 04:53.995
-ls Clara up yet?
-She's watching TV with Oliver.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.334
Are you gonna spend all day
looking for wrinkles...

05:00.541 --> 05:03.203
...or are you going to get in here
and give me a kiss?

05:03.411 --> 05:05.174
l suppose if l have to.

05:06.414 --> 05:09.577
Bully! No, you're not getting
any kisses now.

05:11.018 --> 05:13.987
You know, you don't look
any different.

05:14.322 --> 05:16.984
No. You look much better
than when we met.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.556
l love you.

05:24.065 --> 05:25.498

05:31.472 --> 05:33.440
You always make Daddy feel so good.

05:35.109 --> 05:37.077
You're getting a little old for that.

05:37.278 --> 05:38.108

05:47.889 --> 05:49.754
l'm right behind you, Dad.

05:49.957 --> 05:51.356
Hiding under the table.

05:52.627 --> 05:56.961

these family members break ourhearts,

05:57.198 --> 06:01.567

06:24.959 --> 06:26.517
You want a gift on my birthday?

06:26.727 --> 06:30.219
So you won't feel guilty
you're the only one getting something.

06:30.498 --> 06:32.898
-What's a Sim-Pal?
-A life-size doll.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.933
A make-believe friend
that grows real hair...

06:37.038 --> 06:38.665
...and can do a lot of stuff.

06:39.507 --> 06:42.943
Can't your real friends grow real hair
and do lots of stuff?

06:43.144 --> 06:45.305
Yeah, but they all have Sim-Pals.

06:45.513 --> 06:46.639
Ask your mommy.

06:46.847 --> 06:48.781
You're the greatest, Dad.

06:50.851 --> 06:54.378
Mommy! Mommy!

07:21.549 --> 07:22.846

07:25.786 --> 07:28.687
Destination Double X CharterAirport

07:28.889 --> 07:32.052
She wouldn't stop talking.
My virtual girlfriend talks...

07:32.259 --> 07:33.624
...but l can turn her off.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.455
You and your virtual girls.

07:35.730 --> 07:39.996
You're a grown man, and your primary
relationship is with software.

07:40.201 --> 07:43.602
lf your senses say there's a hot
chick on your lap, there is one.

07:43.804 --> 07:46.364
l don't have to look any further.

07:46.574 --> 07:51.204
They invented the Laser Razor.
No nicks or cuts. You should use it.

07:51.812 --> 07:55.475
l like the old-fashioned kind.
They remind me l'm still alive.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.083
You want to hang out at Kelly's
after work?

07:58.753 --> 08:01.950
l know that Natalie is throwing me
a surprise party.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.754
-Why do you say that?
-l told her you told.

08:05.459 --> 08:07.586
-No, you didn't.
-Oh, yes.

08:07.928 --> 08:09.122
Why did you do that?

08:09.330 --> 08:12.197
l didn't. l just wanted to know
and now l know.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.389
l was that easy.

08:13.601 --> 08:16.866
Your destination, Double X Charter
Airport, is ahead,

08:20.708 --> 08:22.175
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

08:22.843 --> 08:25.311
Manual drive engaged,

08:28.516 --> 08:30.609
Do me a favor at the party.

08:30.818 --> 08:34.184
Don't get drunk and set the drapes on
fire? You already told me.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.980
That too.

08:36.791 --> 08:39.624
What l was going to say was
around 1 1 :30...

08:39.860 --> 08:42.919
...l want you to start singing really
loud, ''Happy Birthday.''

08:43.130 --> 08:45.064
-For what?
-The way you sing...

08:45.266 --> 08:46.824
...it'll clear the place.

08:47.034 --> 08:50.697
l get it. You and Natalie have
a little private party planned.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.635
Good morning, Rosie.
Good morning, everybody.

08:53.874 --> 08:56.866
Henry checked out the remote.
Says you'll love it.

08:57.211 --> 08:58.473
They came in.

08:58.679 --> 09:00.306
This is great. Look at this.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.710
And Drucker's office called.
Guess what?

09:03.984 --> 09:04.814
They canceled.

09:05.052 --> 09:07.646
No. We're going to be tested
for drugs and alcohol.

09:08.055 --> 09:10.649
So? Oh, this is cool.

09:10.891 --> 09:12.552
We're going to be tested?

09:12.827 --> 09:15.728
Not you guys. Just us pilots.

09:16.130 --> 09:19.190
Look at this. The new remote came in.
Out goes the old one.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.837
Get rid of it! Adam, this is Tripp.
lt's his first time with us.

09:24.038 --> 09:25.403
-Welcome.
-How you doing?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.335
Adam? Natalie's on line one.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.578
What's up, honey? You look upset.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.606
Oh, Adam,

09:38.085 --> 09:40.781
ljust talked to the vet,,,

09:40.988 --> 09:43.081
,,,and they had to put Oliver
to sleep,

09:43.357 --> 09:44.688
What? He wasn't that sick.

09:44.925 --> 09:48.224
l know, l know, But apparently
he had some kind of,,,

09:48.429 --> 09:52.593
,,,highly infectious virus, They
had to put him down, lt's the law,

09:52.800 --> 09:54.563
Oliver was licking Clara's face.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.100
Don't worry,
l asked the same thing,,,

09:57.304 --> 10:00.933
,,,and the virus is harmless
to humans, So, she's fine,

10:01.142 --> 10:03.337
This'll break her heart,
you know that.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.211
No, it won't,

l'm not going to have some freak of
science sleep in my daughter's bed.

10:16.023 --> 10:17.615
-lt's not dangerous,
-No.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.520
Oliver can live in our memories.

10:19.727 --> 10:22.218
She's only 8,
She won't understand that,

10:22.563 --> 10:24.531
lt's the natural process of life.

10:24.732 --> 10:28.133
You're born, you live and you die.
She has to learn about it.

10:28.335 --> 10:30.826
But not on yourbirthday,

10:31.038 --> 10:32.232
l appreciate that.

-Will you do it?

11:53.654 --> 11:56.384
-l know somebody.
-l was just asking.

12:02.496 --> 12:03.929
You scared me.

12:04.131 --> 12:05.564
-You proud of yourself?
-Very.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.233
See you guys!

12:14.975 --> 12:18.536
l know you're old-school, but all the
kids today grew up with RePets.

12:18.746 --> 12:20.714
These days it's totally normal.

12:20.714 --> 12:22.074
Not to me.

12:22.349 --> 12:26.012
Not to you? You want her crying
all night because her dog died?

12:26.220 --> 12:27.209
Where's your heart?

12:27.421 --> 12:30.254
-Don't you think it's a little creepy?
-No.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.281

12:33.260 --> 12:33.327
Let's test the remote. Keep up.

12:33.327 --> 12:35.420

12:35.629 --> 12:37.426
All righty. Here we go.

12:45.339 --> 12:48.775
These RePets come back, you can't
tell the difference. Trust me.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.773
-l had it done.
-Bullshit.

12:53.547 --> 12:57.176
l'm serious!
Sadie, my cat...she's a RePet.

12:57.384 --> 12:58.578
You had her cloned?

12:58.986 --> 13:01.614
Well, she fell out of my condo window.

13:39.727 --> 13:41.160
-You did well.
-Thank you.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.262
How long are you to keep me?

13:43.464 --> 13:44.556
Till 7. Why?

13:44.765 --> 13:46.494
Maybe l should check out RePet.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.577
Good morning.
Are you gentlemen the owners?

14:06.787 --> 14:08.482
Yep, that's us.

14:08.689 --> 14:11.886
Excellent. Larry Stern,
l'm with Mr. Drucker's advance team.

14:12.092 --> 14:16.620
l've got a contract here. You'll find
it pretty standard except for....

14:19.533 --> 14:22.366
-Who was flying that one?
-Me, with the remote control.

14:22.803 --> 14:25.431
We can fly four of these
between the two of us now.

14:25.639 --> 14:27.607
-Amazing.
-You here for the blood test?

14:28.142 --> 14:30.736
No. My technician is set up
in your office.

14:30.944 --> 14:33.276
These forms are standard except what?

14:33.480 --> 14:36.278
lt has a nondisclosure clause.
During the flight...

14:36.483 --> 14:38.713
...you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.511
Anything from big mergers...

14:40.721 --> 14:43.315
...to inside information
on his sports teams.

14:43.557 --> 14:46.287
We have a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.

14:46.493 --> 14:48.723
This guy think he's the president?

14:48.996 --> 14:52.454
He considers her to be the world's
second most important person.

14:54.568 --> 14:56.092
That's big stuff.

14:56.503 --> 14:58.403
All for a day of snowboarding?

15:00.240 --> 15:03.107
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, l was screaming.

15:03.310 --> 15:05.904
She's kidding. Don't worry about it.

15:06.246 --> 15:08.407
lt doesn't hurt.
Press your thumb here.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.409
-Right here?
-Just like that.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.811
-All done.
-Didn't feel a thing.

15:15.022 --> 15:17.047
Now your vision.
Place your chin here.

15:17.257 --> 15:18.622
Right here?

15:19.993 --> 15:21.984
Do you blood-test all your pilots?

15:22.196 --> 15:24.164
Pilots, drivers, security, assistants.

15:24.164 --> 15:27.663
Basically, anyone who comes
in contact with Mr. Drucker.

15:31.371 --> 15:32.463
l press here?

15:34.641 --> 15:35.665
And here.

15:41.215 --> 15:43.012
Perfect, both of you.

15:43.617 --> 15:46.950
After this, l'm going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.852
The pink copy of the charter contract
is yours.

15:52.192 --> 15:53.352
l'll take the rest.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.028
-Here we go.
-Have a nice flight, gentlemen.

16:00.067 --> 16:03.503
l can take Drucker. That way,
you'll have time to get Oliver cloned.

16:03.704 --> 16:06.832
l'm not getting the dog cloned.
l'm just gonna check it out.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.804
l know, but once you see it,
you'll say yes.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.910
Deep down inside, you're a softy.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.943
They specifically asked for Adam
by name.

16:15.148 --> 16:18.811
l know. l also know that the
bodyguards can't tell the difference.

16:19.086 --> 16:20.883
They never got our names.

16:21.555 --> 16:22.647
That's true.

16:22.856 --> 16:26.587
Adam, l know l screw around a lot,
but when it comes to flying...

16:26.827 --> 16:28.727
...you know l'm serious.
l could do it.

16:28.929 --> 16:31.159
Go enjoy your birthday.

16:31.498 --> 16:35.366
lf you want to be me, try to act
a little bit more manly.

16:35.836 --> 16:38.270
Chest out. Stomach in.
There you are.

16:38.472 --> 16:39.871
All right.

16:45.012 --> 16:48.345
-All clear.
-l want the Speaker of the House.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.983
Don't mention my name at all.

16:52.119 --> 16:54.679
l'm Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.

16:54.922 --> 16:57.049
Adam's the name and flying's the game.

16:57.257 --> 17:00.124
Pete Hume says you know the mountains
like nobody else.

17:00.327 --> 17:03.057
That's probably true for everyone
except my partner.

17:03.263 --> 17:04.924
l'm looking forward to it.

17:05.132 --> 17:07.292
-We all set?
-We've stationed our people--

17:07.501 --> 17:09.492
-Don't need the details.
-Yes, sir.

17:10.837 --> 17:12.896
Your snowboard's behind your seat.

17:13.106 --> 17:16.598
Dave, look, we gave a lot of money
to his campaign...

17:16.810 --> 17:20.337
...not to mention what l pay
your law firm, so l'm counting on you.

17:20.547 --> 17:21.536
Get me the Speaker.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.477
Good.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.117
Sally, who's next? Okay, put him on.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.116
Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?

18:14.801 --> 18:16.393
Hey, buddy, wake up.

18:16.603 --> 18:17.763
Wake up.

18:18.372 --> 18:19.805
We're here. Woodland Mall.

18:31.084 --> 18:32.142
l was asleep.

18:35.989 --> 18:40.756
Welcome to Woodland Mall,
Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you,

18:41.161 --> 18:45.791
Food court, ground level,
Megaplex theater, 15th level,

18:45.999 --> 18:50.163
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.

18:50.370 --> 18:51.735
Stop the cloning.

18:52.139 --> 18:54.505
God doesn't want you to go in there.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.333
Then God shouldn't have killed my dog.

18:57.544 --> 18:58.875
Atheist.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.582
We can clone your four-legged
loved one in a few hours,

19:03.784 --> 19:05.183
How can we do it?

19:05.385 --> 19:07.615
lt begins with growing ''blanks'',,,

19:07.821 --> 19:10.312
,,,animal drones
stripped of characteristic DNA,,,

19:10.524 --> 19:13.322
,,,in embryonic tanks
at the RePet factory,

19:13.527 --> 19:15.051
ln stage two, yourpet's DNA,,,

19:15.262 --> 19:18.060
,,,is extracted from a lock of fur
ora drop ofblood,,,

19:18.465 --> 19:21.457
,,,then infused on a cellularlevel
into the blank,

19:21.668 --> 19:25.468
ln the final stage, using RePet's
cerebral syncording process,,,

19:25.672 --> 19:28.266
,,,all yourpets thoughts,
memories and instincts,,,

19:28.475 --> 19:30.841
,,,are transplanted
via the optic nerve,

19:32.179 --> 19:34.340
Still can't make up your mind, huh?

19:36.083 --> 19:37.948
You lost a dog, right?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.016
Yes, my daughter's.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.847
What a heartbreak.

19:42.055 --> 19:45.218
-What did you say was his name again?
-Oliver.

19:45.492 --> 19:47.392
Oliver's in luck...

19:47.594 --> 19:50.722
...because we're having
a special this week, 20 percent off.

19:50.931 --> 19:53.456
-When did Oliver die?
-This morning.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.965
Perfect.
We can do a post-mortem syncording...

19:56.169 --> 19:59.661
...but act fast because there's
a 1 2-hour window on deceased brains.

19:59.873 --> 20:02.034
l have a problem with the whole idea.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.143
Suppose the clones have no soul
or they're dangerous?

20:05.612 --> 20:08.137
Clone pets are every bit
as safe as real pets.

20:08.348 --> 20:09.508
Plus...

20:09.716 --> 20:10.740
...they're insured.

20:10.951 --> 20:12.282
lf it's so safe...

20:12.753 --> 20:15.244
...then why is it against the law
to clone humans?

20:15.455 --> 20:18.219
Because the human brain is too
complicated to syncord.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.393
You remember the experiment they did?

20:21.094 --> 20:24.427
That's why it didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.

20:24.631 --> 20:27.566
But with pets, it's a totally
proven technology.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.226
Your RePet Oliver
will be exactly the same dog.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.497
He'll know the tricks
you taught him...

20:33.707 --> 20:37.438
...where the bones are buried--
He won't even know he's a clone.

20:38.211 --> 20:39.610
And did l mention...

20:39.813 --> 20:41.110
...they're insured.

20:41.314 --> 20:42.872
l don't care about insurance.

20:43.083 --> 20:46.519
l care if l can trust my daughter
with an animal with sharp teeth.

20:46.987 --> 20:50.081
We can make him smaller.
With softer teeth.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.279
You can?

20:51.491 --> 20:55.291
We can even color-coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.

20:55.595 --> 20:57.529
Sim-Pals, the best friend
money can buy,

20:57.898 --> 20:59.263
Let me think about that.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.934
--who's fun to be with,
Treatyourkids--

21:02.435 --> 21:04.198
Look, l might be back.

21:05.071 --> 21:06.231
You'll be back.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.600
Your daughter will think
you're the best.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.142
-My sister has two and loves them.
-Good.

21:12.345 --> 21:13.869
Come, let's fix the collar.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.479
There you are.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.980
-lt's amazing how real this is.
-l know.

21:18.185 --> 21:19.914
My daughter will be so excited.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.712
Come, let's go home.

21:28.395 --> 21:29.987
You have called Hank Morgan,

21:30.197 --> 21:32.461
Hi, l'm not here, so leave a message,

21:32.666 --> 21:34.099
Hank, it's me again.

21:34.301 --> 21:38.294
What happened to you? l waited at
Kelly's for half an hour. lt's now...

21:38.505 --> 21:42.839
-...five past 7.
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname?

21:43.143 --> 21:46.408
l'm heading home now.
lf you get this message--

21:46.613 --> 21:47.875
Let's be friends,

21:48.081 --> 21:49.378
What's yourname?

21:49.583 --> 21:51.915
Can't you see l'm talking? Quiet.

21:52.118 --> 21:56.987
--head to my house with flowers and a
good excuse, or Natalie will kill you.

21:57.224 --> 22:01.160
l can sing songs,
Would you like to sing with me?

22:01.361 --> 22:03.727
Excuse me, do you know how
to turn this off?

22:04.197 --> 22:07.462
My niece has one.
Say, ''Go to sleep, Cindy.''

22:07.667 --> 22:10.636
-Go to sleep, Cindy.
-Would you like to sing,,,,

22:10.837 --> 22:12.270
Go to sleep.

22:21.147 --> 22:23.513
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.184
Good night.

22:34.861 --> 22:36.852
Clara, sweetie, honey.

22:37.364 --> 22:41.198
Oliver was very sick and he had to be
put down.

22:44.037 --> 22:48.371
Clara, sweetie, honey. Oliver
had to go to heaven.

22:49.376 --> 22:50.707
''Why, Daddy?''

22:51.211 --> 22:53.372
Well, you see, because...

22:54.714 --> 22:56.375
...it's because, uh....

22:57.217 --> 22:59.481
Shit, Oliver! Why'd you have to die?

23:03.156 --> 23:04.384
Oliver?

23:11.398 --> 23:12.729
Natalie.

23:36.022 --> 23:37.182
One...

23:37.557 --> 23:39.149
...two, three!

23:45.165 --> 23:47.429
That's amazing. Look at this cake!

23:49.869 --> 23:51.598
Oh, my God.

24:14.527 --> 24:15.858
Adam Gibson?

24:16.463 --> 24:17.452
Who are you?

24:17.797 --> 24:20.197
We have a situation.
Come with us, please.

24:21.201 --> 24:22.793
What the hell is going on?

24:23.036 --> 24:25.197
Cooperate and everything will be fine.

24:25.472 --> 24:30.409
Fine? Someone's in my house, eating
my birthday cake and it's not me!

24:30.810 --> 24:34.803
We know. There's been a 6th Day
violation. A human was cloned.

24:35.215 --> 24:37.843
-That human was you.
-We can help.

24:38.151 --> 24:41.086
-Then get him out!
-But you'll have to come with us.

24:41.821 --> 24:45.655
l don't know who the hell
you people are...

24:46.393 --> 24:48.384
-...but l'm going in my house.
-Right.

24:59.739 --> 25:01.730
Oops, Cindy fell down,

25:02.008 --> 25:03.407
Get the doll.

25:08.581 --> 25:09.741
Not here.

25:22.595 --> 25:25.530
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname?

25:30.103 --> 25:32.264
l can play games,

25:43.883 --> 25:44.713
Shit.

25:49.456 --> 25:51.549
Wiley, no! Hold your fire!

25:51.791 --> 25:52.951
That way! Go!

25:53.226 --> 25:54.625
Vincent, go!

25:54.961 --> 25:56.952
l have a boo-boo,

26:14.414 --> 26:15.745
Stop the car!

26:16.483 --> 26:17.575
Stop the car!

26:20.587 --> 26:22.578
Thanks for the suggestion!

26:24.324 --> 26:25.313
Don't even blink.

26:25.992 --> 26:27.983
Oh, God. Someone stole the minivan.

26:28.328 --> 26:30.319
No, they stole my Cadillac.

26:31.498 --> 26:32.658
Oh, no.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.001
Car chase. Cool.

26:47.113 --> 26:49.274
-Who are you?
-l was hired to kill you.

26:49.682 --> 26:51.513
That's all l know.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.011
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,
What's yourname?

26:56.289 --> 26:57.779
Secure child-seat restraint,

26:58.024 --> 26:59.514
Let's be friends,

27:16.876 --> 27:19.310
-Where is this guy?
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,

27:20.313 --> 27:21.644
Let's be friends,

27:22.048 --> 27:23.379
What's yourname?

27:24.717 --> 27:26.048
Will you be my mommy?

27:26.319 --> 27:27.650
l don't want to be your mommy!

27:27.887 --> 27:29.377
-Shut up!
-What?

27:33.560 --> 27:35.824
Somebody do something about that doll!

27:40.900 --> 27:43.232
l have a boo-boo,

27:50.243 --> 27:53.235
This is crazy. Why does anyone
want to kill me?

27:53.746 --> 27:55.179
He got home first.

27:55.415 --> 27:58.680
You saw him, he didn't see you.
You're screwed.

27:58.918 --> 28:02.513
He's going to live your boring life
and never be the wiser.

28:04.090 --> 28:07.253
Your wife and kid see you two
together, they'll be killed.

28:52.472 --> 28:54.133
Goddamn it, Wiley!

28:55.642 --> 28:56.973
Son of a bitch.

29:15.995 --> 29:17.155
Stupid!

29:17.430 --> 29:19.660
Blow out his tires this time!

29:28.341 --> 29:29.672
Shit!

30:11.384 --> 30:13.045
That was spectacular.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.731
Son of a bitch.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.501
Hold my belt.

30:36.242 --> 30:37.231
Okay.

30:41.414 --> 30:42.346
You got me?

30:45.351 --> 30:46.579
Little more.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.610
Get some people
to look for this guy!

31:14.881 --> 31:18.112
Pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies
and get them to the lab.

31:36.803 --> 31:41.263
l'm Dr, Griffin Weir, Welcome to the
new Weir Organ Transplant Facility,

31:41.474 --> 31:44.170
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

31:46.446 --> 31:49.176
Doctor, protesters claim
that cloning human organs,,,

31:49.382 --> 31:51.350
,,,will lead to cloning whole humans,

31:51.918 --> 31:55.479
That's not only illegal, we're years
from the technology to do it.

31:55.688 --> 31:58.213
A human was cloned over 1 0 years ago.

31:58.424 --> 32:00.824
And we know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.

32:01.327 --> 32:05.627
lf you recall, the Supreme Court
ordered the clone be destroyed...

32:05.832 --> 32:08.266
...and l think that was
the humane thing to do.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.493
lt led to laws against
human cloning...

32:10.703 --> 32:14.002
...and set back the course of
legitimate research by years.

32:14.340 --> 32:16.331
Mr. Drucker! You gave--

32:16.676 --> 32:18.837
This is Dr. Weir's night, okay?

32:19.178 --> 32:22.011
ls it true you want to get
the 6th Day laws repealed?

32:22.281 --> 32:25.011
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine,
not politics.

32:25.284 --> 32:29.118
Mr. Drucker, the protesters claim you
run RePet at a loss...

32:29.355 --> 32:31.482
...to soften people
up to human cloning.

32:31.691 --> 32:34.956
You know, we shouldn't forget
that not long ago...

32:35.628 --> 32:38.256
...there were almost no more fish
left in the ocean...

32:38.464 --> 32:41.524
...and half the world's population
faced the threat of hunger.

32:41.734 --> 32:44.225
Cloning technology turned that around.

32:44.470 --> 32:47.803
Extremists won't admit
they'd rather people went hungry...

32:48.074 --> 32:50.975
...than eat cloned fish,
so they yell about human cloning.

32:51.244 --> 32:54.145
Do you think human cloning laws
should be changed?

32:54.480 --> 32:58.507
Suppose a 1 0-year-old boy is in the
hospital, dying of liver cancer.

32:58.718 --> 33:00.515
Thanks to Dr. Weir's work...

33:00.720 --> 33:02.449
...we can save that boy.

33:02.655 --> 33:05.556
ln the next bed lies
another 1 0-year-old boy...

33:05.758 --> 33:08.090
...whose parents love him
just as much...

33:08.294 --> 33:10.922
...only he has
an inoperable brain tumor.

33:11.130 --> 33:13.564
You cannot clone a brain.

33:13.766 --> 33:16.860
The only way to save him
would be to clone the whole person.

33:17.303 --> 33:21.433
How do you tell that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy...

33:21.674 --> 33:24.837
...but the research that would have
saved their son wasn't done...

33:25.111 --> 33:28.547
...because of a law passed by
frightened politicians a decade ago?

33:29.015 --> 33:30.846
So, what does that mean?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.514
Enjoy the party.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.954
-Looks like you needed rescuing.
-Yes, l did. Thank you.

33:44.196 --> 33:48.860
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

33:49.201 --> 33:53.695
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

33:56.208 --> 33:57.106
Hey, boss!

33:58.044 --> 34:00.535
Johnny. How's my star quarterback?

34:01.981 --> 34:05.974
l'd say l felt like a million bucks,
but l'd hate to take a pay cut.

34:06.552 --> 34:08.143
Don't remind me, all right?

34:08.353 --> 34:11.152
That was one nasty hit you took
last week.

34:11.389 --> 34:14.324
Be careful. We don't want you
getting killed.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.222
Katherine? Are you all right?

34:17.496 --> 34:19.896
l'm just feeling
like l don't quite belong.

34:20.565 --> 34:22.397
But l'm fine. Really.

34:22.735 --> 34:24.065
No, you're not.

34:24.904 --> 34:26.393
Should l call Dr. Stevens?

34:26.672 --> 34:29.572
No, no, no.
l just overdid it, that's all.

34:30.076 --> 34:32.067
l'll get a car to take you home.

34:32.344 --> 34:33.402
Thank you.

34:36.916 --> 34:40.408
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much
for coming. Champagne?

34:40.753 --> 34:43.722
-That was quite a speech.
-You heard that?

34:43.922 --> 34:45.254
Sorry l got carried away.

34:45.524 --> 34:47.856
Your words meant a great deal to me.

34:48.094 --> 34:51.928
As it happens, l have a son
with an inoperable tumor of the brain.

34:52.864 --> 34:55.697
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry, sir.

34:55.935 --> 34:59.029
lt must have been in my subconscious,
knowing you were here.

34:59.238 --> 35:01.331
No, no, it's all right.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.098
Gave me a lot to think about.

35:03.442 --> 35:05.933
lt gave me a different view
of the subject.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.610
Mr. Speaker...

35:08.948 --> 35:12.440
...could l offer you a glass of brandy
in my office upstairs?

35:22.628 --> 35:24.459
l was 0 when Billy was born.

35:25.064 --> 35:27.965
l didn't know if l wanted
another kid so late.

35:28.634 --> 35:31.296
But now l love him so damn much.

35:35.141 --> 35:37.974
lf there were something
we could do for Billy...

35:39.645 --> 35:41.806
,,,only it was highly illegal,,,

35:42.481 --> 35:43.778
...would you consider it?

35:43.983 --> 35:46.645
Of course l would.
That's the same hypothetical--

35:46.986 --> 35:49.648
No, no. Don't answer so fast.

35:50.823 --> 35:54.657
You'd face a minimum sentence of
40 years if it ever came out.

35:54.994 --> 35:56.256
But he'd be cured?

35:56.495 --> 35:58.156
He'd be exactly the same.

35:58.831 --> 35:59.820
Perfect health,

36:00.499 --> 36:01.932
Never even have to know.

36:03.436 --> 36:05.267
But if the secret came out,,,

36:05.504 --> 36:07.165
...with the law now...

36:07.440 --> 36:09.772
,,,he'd be put to sleep
like a rabid dog,

36:10.342 --> 36:12.936
He'd be destroyed,
like a horse with a broken leg.

36:13.179 --> 36:15.613
And ifit never came out?

36:16.348 --> 36:18.839
Or if the laws were changed one day?

36:22.021 --> 36:24.512
Billy wouldn't have
anything to worry about.

36:54.720 --> 36:54.887
l beg you.

36:54.887 --> 36:56.047
l beg you.

36:56.322 --> 36:59.223
Go to my house and pick up
my wife and daughter.

36:59.492 --> 37:01.722
lf l go there, they'll kill them both.

37:03.329 --> 37:05.320
You made a different report
an hour ago.

37:05.564 --> 37:06.656
No, l didn't.

37:06.899 --> 37:09.265
According to this, you did.

37:09.468 --> 37:11.231
That must have been the clone.

37:13.572 --> 37:16.268
Look, l know it sounds crazy.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.568
l can hardly believe it myself.

37:18.844 --> 37:21.005
-Was your car stolen or not?
-Yes.

37:21.247 --> 37:23.841
-So you did report it?
-No, l took it.

37:24.083 --> 37:25.243
You stole your own car?

37:25.518 --> 37:29.352
l'm a court-appointed virtual
attorney. You don't have to answer.

37:29.588 --> 37:32.022
ls my client being charged
with auto theft?

37:32.258 --> 37:33.589
l didn't steal it! lt's mine!

37:33.859 --> 37:35.918
He claims it was filed by his clone.

37:36.195 --> 37:39.028
l see. Loading virtual psychiatrist.

37:39.598 --> 37:43.090
Mr. Gibson,
what seems to be the trouble?

37:44.436 --> 37:46.267
Go through it now with him?

37:46.539 --> 37:48.939
You're avoiding
talking about your parents.

37:49.208 --> 37:52.200
lmagine: Two turtles
are walking through the desert--

37:52.444 --> 37:53.433
Shut up!

38:00.452 --> 38:01.282
What?

38:02.788 --> 38:05.552
-Are you going to help me or not?
-Of course we are.

38:05.791 --> 38:09.124
Medical alert transmitted,
Awaiting data,

38:09.962 --> 38:13.125
Wait in here. l'll come get you
as soon as we have news.

38:20.739 --> 38:21.831
Clones.

38:56.108 --> 38:58.269
He saw himself at his house tonight.

38:58.477 --> 39:00.206
Which was our mistake, not his.

39:00.446 --> 39:01.777
Excuse me.

39:02.781 --> 39:04.442
He's at precinct seven.

39:04.783 --> 39:07.775
Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along?
l'll need them both.

40:22.027 --> 40:23.858
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

40:33.539 --> 40:36.702
Piece of shit Wiley.
l'm gonna kill him. Where is he?

40:38.377 --> 40:40.208
He's still cooking.

40:40.879 --> 40:42.312
Son of a bitch.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.320
l look like crap.

40:52.224 --> 40:55.159
Do you have any idea how much
my hair treatments cost?

40:55.394 --> 40:56.986
How much does Gibson know?

40:57.229 --> 41:01.029
That he's been cloned and we'll
kill anyone who sees them together.

41:01.233 --> 41:03.224
What's that? What?

41:04.136 --> 41:07.731
Does Drucker know you're talking
about killing innocent people?

41:08.374 --> 41:09.773
Relax. lt's just a threat.

41:10.042 --> 41:12.067
Of course, we'd never actually do it.

41:14.046 --> 41:15.536
Try to have a good night.

41:15.748 --> 41:18.911
You do your hair.
l'll take Wiley and Vincent.

41:19.251 --> 41:21.742
l've got to pierce my damn ears again.

41:24.690 --> 41:28.126
Officials blame the latest strike
by majorleague players,,,

41:28.327 --> 41:30.557
,,,entering its 4th year
and a lack,,,

41:30.763 --> 41:35.097
,,,of fan identification with teams
in the Series for the dismal ratings,

41:36.769 --> 41:38.100
Shit.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.712
Oh, no.

42:05.964 --> 42:07.295
Now what?

42:08.467 --> 42:10.799
lt feels tight all across here...

42:11.136 --> 42:13.297
...where the tires ran over me.

42:13.639 --> 42:16.631
You were run over by two cars
and your chest was crushed.

42:16.975 --> 42:19.535
Exactly. l mean, no wonder, right?

42:19.878 --> 42:20.936
lt's in your mind.

42:21.146 --> 42:23.205
Completely crushed.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.746
As in dead.

42:25.484 --> 42:28.647
As in you have
a totally new chest now.

42:29.488 --> 42:31.149
Then why is it hard to breathe?

42:32.658 --> 42:33.989
Tell you what.

42:34.193 --> 42:36.491
Why don't you just stay out here?
Relax.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.821
The fresh air will do you good.

42:39.631 --> 42:42.725
State and government officials
in Washington, D,C,,,

42:42.935 --> 42:45.836
,,,are openly dismissive
of the Microsoftproposal,

42:46.438 --> 42:50.932
This amounts to an attempt by
Microsoft to buy a state of the Union,

42:51.176 --> 42:53.667
Nothing in our Constitution
orhistory,,,

42:54.012 --> 42:56.674
,,,offers the remotest legal theory,,,

42:56.949 --> 43:00.009
,,,by which a corporation can,
in effect, own a state,

43:07.793 --> 43:12.730
But if he goes off his medication,
the paranoid delusions come back.

43:18.403 --> 43:23.238
Very sad. Because at other times,
he seems almost rational.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.141
Gibson!

43:27.146 --> 43:28.238
Gibson!

44:07.619 --> 44:08.950
-You're dead.
-No.

44:10.756 --> 44:11.950
You're dead.

44:21.934 --> 44:23.925
Try to stay dead this time.

44:32.611 --> 44:34.078
Hank, it's me again,

44:34.279 --> 44:35.940
What happened to you?

44:36.215 --> 44:39.116
l waited forhalfan hourat Kelly's,

44:39.318 --> 44:40.842
lt's now five past 7,

44:41.053 --> 44:42.714
l'm heading home, okay?

44:48.627 --> 44:50.891
He's fine. He's okay.
He's our associate.

44:51.296 --> 44:53.059
Gibson must have knocked him out.

44:53.298 --> 44:55.892
Knocked him out?
He looks dead to me, doc.

44:57.970 --> 45:00.131
No. Pulse is strong.

45:00.405 --> 45:04.808
He'll be up and around in no time.
We'll get him to the hospital.

45:05.143 --> 45:06.303
Easy.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.739
Let us know if you find Gibson.

45:14.553 --> 45:16.453
Honey, l'm home.

45:18.657 --> 45:20.318
Darling, where are you?

45:20.592 --> 45:21.650
Hi, sugar.

45:21.927 --> 45:22.985
Hello, my love.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.093
Have you been working out?

45:28.667 --> 45:30.828
-You look so good.
-Thank you.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.003
l recorded your sports programs.

45:33.205 --> 45:35.264
Maybe we can watch them together.

45:35.507 --> 45:36.667
l'd like that.

45:37.009 --> 45:39.170
Or should l just take this off now?

45:39.678 --> 45:41.509
No. Hold your horses.

45:48.854 --> 45:53.018
Oh, Hank, l think it's so sexy
when you go right to the chair.

45:53.358 --> 45:54.347
l know you do.

46:00.198 --> 46:03.031
You're gonna have to
zip me up, sweetheart.

46:05.570 --> 46:06.969
Careful with the merchandise.

46:10.709 --> 46:12.370
Hold on, please!

46:15.547 --> 46:17.412
-Have they been here?
-Who?

46:18.183 --> 46:19.980
Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer?

46:22.821 --> 46:25.221
l'm sorry l missed the party, but...

46:25.557 --> 46:29.789
...all of a sudden it's 1 1 :00
and l wound up at Kelly's.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.695
-You missed my party?
-Not on purpose.

46:32.898 --> 46:37.198
lt was sort of weird. l feel
terrible. l don't know what happened.

46:37.402 --> 46:41.463
You feel terrible? l lost my wife,
my daughter and my life tonight.

46:41.740 --> 46:42.729
--special dance.

46:42.941 --> 46:44.203
Hank, listen.

46:44.409 --> 46:45.467
l need your help.

46:46.745 --> 46:48.337
Not now, cupcake!

46:48.580 --> 46:50.514
What going on? l don't understand.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.149
That's a real gun.

46:56.688 --> 46:58.246
What, what's going--?

47:10.102 --> 47:12.593
Jesus! What are you gonna do?
Kill my cat?

47:13.271 --> 47:15.102
What the hell is going on?

47:15.440 --> 47:18.932
lf you weren't at my party,
then you didn't see him.

47:19.177 --> 47:20.508
Who's ''him''?

47:38.530 --> 47:42.364
Jesus H. Christ. l said
get your dog cloned, not yourself.

47:42.701 --> 47:44.692
What are you going to do?

47:45.036 --> 47:46.697
Take my life back.

47:46.972 --> 47:48.371
You're going to kill him?

47:48.640 --> 47:51.803
Why not? He's not real.
Plus, there's no law against it.

47:52.043 --> 47:53.533
You're not serious.

47:53.745 --> 47:55.076
l'm dead serious.

47:57.482 --> 47:59.814
But look at him.
He looks just like you.

48:00.018 --> 48:02.748
Technically, this could be
committing suicide.

48:03.488 --> 48:05.046
But he's not me.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.656
He's not even human.

48:06.992 --> 48:11.156
Wait a second. How do l know
he's not you and you're not him?

48:11.496 --> 48:14.090
Look at him.
He's even a shitty carpenter.

48:15.667 --> 48:17.498
-Let me see your chin.
-My chin?

48:17.836 --> 48:19.997
-You cut yourself shaving.
-Here.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.337
Okay, it's there. You're you.

48:54.706 --> 48:56.139
l couldn't do it.

48:58.210 --> 48:59.199
Over here.

49:03.949 --> 49:05.678
l have a little something for you.

49:06.017 --> 49:07.951
-ls Clara asleep?
-Yes, she is.

49:17.028 --> 49:18.495
He's grabbing her ass.

49:18.697 --> 49:20.858
l like how cigars make you feel.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.492
Daddy?

49:36.181 --> 49:37.842
What are you doing out here?

49:38.850 --> 49:40.010
l had a bad dream.

49:41.586 --> 49:44.419
l'll take you back to bed. Come on.

49:44.756 --> 49:47.088
-Fireman.
-Fireman, right.

49:48.593 --> 49:49.753
Wait here.

49:54.266 --> 49:55.597
Cigar, sir?

49:56.935 --> 49:58.425
l can't wait.

50:04.943 --> 50:06.774
-How do you like it?
-This is so good.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.034
Want to try some?

50:08.280 --> 50:11.943
No. Smoking's illegal,
and l'm a mother-- All right.

50:19.457 --> 50:21.721
Sweetheart, l'm sorry about the RePet.

50:22.961 --> 50:24.622
lt's all right.

50:25.130 --> 50:26.119
Dad?

50:26.464 --> 50:28.125
Did Oliver die?

50:28.466 --> 50:30.058
ls he a RePet?

50:30.902 --> 50:32.233
Why do you say that?

50:32.470 --> 50:34.131
You locked him outside.

50:34.472 --> 50:37.134
l did? Oh, l'm so sorry.

50:37.475 --> 50:39.807
l haven't been myself lately.

50:52.824 --> 50:55.486
All right. You go to sleep now.

50:55.827 --> 50:57.158
Close your eyes.

50:58.997 --> 51:02.262
When was the last time we did it
in the back of the car?

51:03.001 --> 51:05.333
We should smoke cigars more often.

51:19.918 --> 51:21.010
Mr. Gibson?

51:21.386 --> 51:24.014
-Who are you?
-Millennium Security. Sorry to--

51:24.222 --> 51:25.849
You got any l.D.?

51:26.124 --> 51:27.113
Of course.

51:30.195 --> 51:33.528
Sorry l was a little jumpy
but we had a break-in earlier.

51:33.798 --> 51:34.958
We know.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.200
Your car was found in the river.

51:37.469 --> 51:39.699
They find the bastard that stole it?

51:41.039 --> 51:43.030
Relax. He's a friend of mine.

51:44.442 --> 51:45.534
Sorry about this.

51:46.111 --> 51:47.601
Nice 'do.

51:48.446 --> 51:50.607
He's here to help me fix the garage.

51:50.882 --> 51:51.940
Heel!

51:52.617 --> 51:53.948
Now what?

51:54.452 --> 51:55.612
Go see.

51:55.954 --> 51:57.387
Sorry, but he's a RePet.

51:57.622 --> 52:02.559
He was a good watchdog. Now he lets
my car get stolen and barks.

52:02.894 --> 52:04.054
l hate clones.

52:07.232 --> 52:09.564
Well, we'll keep an eye
on your property.

52:12.637 --> 52:15.071
l'll sleep better
knowing you're around.

52:15.306 --> 52:16.603
Try to have a good night.

52:16.908 --> 52:18.899
-Good night.
-Take it easy.

52:25.483 --> 52:26.643
Hide.

52:32.323 --> 52:33.984
Stop it, Oliver.

52:38.663 --> 52:39.994
Stop it.

52:44.669 --> 52:48.002
Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.

53:00.185 --> 53:03.677
Good Oliver. That was a bad idea.

53:05.523 --> 53:09.789
-Let's get out of here.
-We can't leave them with that thing.

53:14.866 --> 53:17.027
Those were the guys trying to kill me.

53:17.235 --> 53:20.398
lt's dangerous for Natalie and Clara
if l hang around.

53:30.048 --> 53:32.039
Darling, you're still awake.

53:32.550 --> 53:35.383
l wanted to wait up for you.

53:35.887 --> 53:36.876
Thank you.

53:37.155 --> 53:39.817
And l wanted to spend time
with these flowers.

53:40.158 --> 53:42.649
lt took me 1 7 generations
to get this right.

53:42.894 --> 53:44.987
lf you had told me, l could have--

53:45.230 --> 53:48.324
l know. Engineered it
in half an hour.

53:50.068 --> 53:52.901
l'm not in that much of a hurry,
Griffin.

53:55.006 --> 53:57.236
Want to get a cup of tea,
then go upstairs?

53:58.076 --> 53:59.236
Yeah.

54:00.078 --> 54:02.239
That's a good idea. Let's do that.

54:11.256 --> 54:12.746
lt's okay.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.691
Stay calm.

54:18.196 --> 54:19.788
Stay very, very calm.

54:20.098 --> 54:21.065
What a night.

54:21.266 --> 54:23.757
That was the longest night in my life.

54:27.705 --> 54:29.400
Hello, Adam.

54:29.607 --> 54:31.837
l'm a one-man Virtual Girl...

54:32.043 --> 54:34.637
...but if you insert
the installation disk....

54:35.547 --> 54:37.174
-What was that?
-Nothing.

54:37.382 --> 54:40.579
l felt fingers going for my zipper.
That's disgusting.

54:40.785 --> 54:45.313
That's disgusting? l had to look away
when you and Natalie were--

54:46.224 --> 54:48.215
The.... You want a beer?

54:49.561 --> 54:52.496
You saw the clone do something
with Natalie.

54:52.730 --> 54:54.163
They did nothing.

54:54.399 --> 54:58.335
-That's not what l would have done.
-What would you have done?

54:58.570 --> 54:59.901
l would have....

55:02.574 --> 55:03.506
Nothing.

55:03.741 --> 55:07.074
Well, that's what they did.
You know...nothing.

55:07.412 --> 55:09.903
Shit. ln the goddamn minivan.

55:10.181 --> 55:11.341
ln the minivan.

55:12.083 --> 55:14.574
You know what tobacco does to people.

55:14.853 --> 55:16.252
He smoked my stogie too?

55:17.021 --> 55:18.079
The bastard.

55:18.423 --> 55:19.913
That son of a bitch.

55:20.191 --> 55:23.024
Son of a bitch smoked your stogie.

55:23.428 --> 55:25.259
She couldn't tell it wasn't me?

55:25.530 --> 55:28.431
lt didn't look like it.
l mean, she seemed...

55:29.601 --> 55:30.932
...happy.

55:31.870 --> 55:34.862
You have no idea what it felt like
seeing her with him.

55:35.106 --> 55:36.869
l should have just killed him.

55:37.108 --> 55:41.204
lt could have been worse.
At least she's not cheating on you.

55:45.216 --> 55:46.205
Don't move!

55:48.953 --> 55:49.942
Tripp!

55:50.221 --> 55:51.779
l'm not after you.

55:52.624 --> 55:53.955
Back away.

55:56.961 --> 55:58.451
Back away.

55:59.297 --> 56:00.628
Why did you do that?

56:00.899 --> 56:04.699
Don't do anything stupid, now.
That's as far as you go.

56:06.638 --> 56:07.969
ls that you, Hank?

56:38.536 --> 56:39.764
Hank!

56:44.008 --> 56:45.839
Hey, Adam.

56:46.110 --> 56:49.170
ls Hank sleeping on the floor again?

56:49.781 --> 56:51.772
That's so cute.

57:17.875 --> 57:21.367
On the sixth day, God created man.
On the sixth day....

57:22.647 --> 57:26.708
On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the sixth day.

57:28.386 --> 57:30.047
Why did you kill my friend?

57:30.888 --> 57:33.982
Hank Morgan was
an abomination to God.

57:35.159 --> 57:36.319
He was a clone.

57:36.561 --> 57:37.892
He was no clone.

57:38.096 --> 57:40.155
The real Hank Morgan died
this afternoon.

57:41.666 --> 57:42.997
l killed him.

57:43.568 --> 57:44.694
So l could...

57:44.902 --> 57:46.563
...so l could kill Drucker.

57:46.904 --> 57:49.839
Drucker isn't dead.
lt would be all over the news.

57:50.074 --> 57:51.837
Open your eyes.

57:52.043 --> 57:53.237
Drucker's a clone.

57:53.578 --> 57:58.242
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
Dr. Weir cloned your friend.

57:59.417 --> 58:00.850
Dr. Weir cloned you.

58:06.924 --> 58:08.516
They found us.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.119
Shoot me in the head.

58:11.329 --> 58:13.524
-What--
-We have people at Weir's lab!

58:13.731 --> 58:16.757
l know who they are.
They scan my brain, they'll be killed.

58:19.237 --> 58:20.795
Shoot me.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.028
God forgive me.

59:47.291 --> 59:49.452
Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?

59:50.795 --> 59:52.786
Who are you people?

59:57.268 --> 59:58.758
l,D, required,

01:00:00.104 --> 01:00:01.594
Use biometric reader,,,

01:00:01.806 --> 01:00:03.831
,,,to verify identification,,,

01:00:04.175 --> 01:00:07.941
,,,or the alarm will sound
in 10 seconds, Ten,,,

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:09.477
-He shot my foot!
-,,,nine,,,

01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:11.742

-Son of a bitch!

,,,four,,,three,,,

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.615
,,,two,,,one,

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:19.812
Stand by,

01:00:23.094 --> 01:00:24.755
Systems accessed,

01:00:25.296 --> 01:00:26.263
Gibson!

01:00:27.265 --> 01:00:28.596
Select destination,

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:37.137
You're gonna pay!

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.776
Those were brand-new boots!

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.242
Dad? You're coming
to my recital, right?

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:55.074
Of course. l never miss
your recitals.

01:01:55.353 --> 01:01:56.684
l love you.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.253
You're the greatest, Dad,

01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:10.264
Unless herpseudomonas infection
clears up,,,

01:02:10.668 --> 01:02:13.262
...l'm afraid there's
nothing we can do.

01:02:15.339 --> 01:02:17.398
What about her DNA scan?

01:02:18.509 --> 01:02:20.670
Came up with cystic fibrosis.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:21.934
Cystic fibrosis?

01:02:22.179 --> 01:02:25.580
Which is impossible, considering
it's a childhood disease...

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:28.115
...and she would have been dead
30 years ago.

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:30.480
We're running the scan again.

01:02:31.522 --> 01:02:35.481
No, l'll do it at the clinic.
lf you could give us a moment, please.

01:02:37.028 --> 01:02:38.791
Darling. Sweetheart.

01:02:39.363 --> 01:02:42.127
We're having you transferred
to my clinic.

01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:45.195
No. l'd like to stay here.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:50.134
l can help you at the clinic. lf you
stay here, there's nothing l can do.

01:02:50.408 --> 01:02:52.638
l know, dear. l'll die.

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:54.138
Yes.

01:02:54.478 --> 01:02:55.809
Katherine, please.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.138
Listen to me.

01:02:57.815 --> 01:02:59.749
Katherine died  years ago.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:05.149
The feelings l have aren't mine.
They're hers.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.319
Katherine, listen.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:15.488
Don't do this.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.163
l need you so much. l need you.

01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:22.832
l'm not afraid, Griffin.

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:25.672
l want to die.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.668
My time has already passed.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.011
My love.

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:35.985
What am l to do without you?

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.176
What?

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:42.356
You just water my flowers...

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.525
...okay?

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.364
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:59.039
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.641
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

01:04:01.846 --> 01:04:03.404
We're in the business oflife,

01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:07.545
Welcome to the new home of the
Weir Organ Transplant Facility,,,

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:10.149
,,,here at Replacement Technologies,

01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:25.392
Excuse me, sir.
l've got to check that.

01:04:27.171 --> 01:04:29.332
Sure. Help yourself.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:32.030
But...

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.870
...you might want to use these.

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:35.067
What's in here?

01:04:35.279 --> 01:04:37.611
Lower intestines for Dr. Weir.

01:04:37.815 --> 01:04:40.249
He's doing a study
on the flesh-eating virus.

01:04:40.518 --> 01:04:42.042
You can open it.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.744
Just try not to breathe.

01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:49.385
That's okay.

01:04:49.593 --> 01:04:50.685
You're cleared.

01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:52.260
Thanks.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.872
What about herDNA scan?

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.107
Came up with cystic fibrosis,

01:05:07.311 --> 01:05:10.280
Which is impossible considering
it's a childhood disease--

01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:11.641
--dead 30 years ago,

01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:16.880
So we're running a new scan,

01:05:17.888 --> 01:05:19.879
No, l'll do it at the clinic,

01:05:23.394 --> 01:05:26.454
We've had 5 extra years
since you cloned me,

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.621
l treasure that,

01:05:28.899 --> 01:05:30.196
-Katherine, please,
-No,

01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:31.561
Please,

01:05:31.902 --> 01:05:33.802
l'm not afraid.

01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:36.299
l want to die.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:39.666
My time has already passed.

01:06:47.311 --> 01:06:48.642
Can l help you?

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.881
No. l just dropped my pen.

01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:57.884
l'm all thumbs today.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.891
Thank you.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:17.730
Will you cut that out?
lt's driving me crazy.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:21.408
Excuse me, but l nearly had my head
ripped off and it hurts.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:25.181
lt's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.747
You'd know better about that?

01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:28.210
Yes, he would.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:31.911
lt was your old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.686
-l got killed twice in two hours.
-Knock it off. We've all been killed.

01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:39.393
You know what really bothers me?

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.758
That l've never even seen
a white light.

01:07:42.032 --> 01:07:43.590
Never seen angels. Nothing.

01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.198
Give me a break.

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:53.240
l have you logged in.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.545
What? When?

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:59.177
Twenty minutes ago.
You've entered a restricted area.

01:07:59.383 --> 01:08:01.214
Son of a bitch has got my thumb.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.784
Deactivate Talia,
put out a security alert...

01:08:03.988 --> 01:08:06.456
...and seal off Drucker's office, now!
Let's go!

01:08:23.741 --> 01:08:25.140
Shit.

01:08:25.809 --> 01:08:27.106
Can l help you?

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.300
Yeah.

01:08:28.746 --> 01:08:30.737
You can stick your thumb on that.

01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:01.675
-Thank God.
-What? More fundamentalists?

01:09:01.944 --> 01:09:04.505
No. Adam Gibson.
We think he's in the building.

01:09:04.782 --> 01:09:06.807
Why wasn't he taken care of already?

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.322
There are four of you and one of him!

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:18.791
Two of him, but you see what l mean.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.125
He has a wife and kid, right?
Get them. We may need the leverage.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.867
lt costs me $1 .2 million
each time l clone you people.

01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:28.866
Try to be worth the money.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:54.993
They'll kill you for seeing this.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:59.066
They're doing their best already.
Where's Dr. Weir?

01:10:01.004 --> 01:10:02.562
His lab's over there.

01:10:09.346 --> 01:10:09.480
Dr. Weir.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.674
Dr. Weir.

01:10:12.516 --> 01:10:15.212
l know about the intruder.
Your office called.

01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:17.353
Everything's under control.

01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:21.914
lt's not under control.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:26.092
You had me cloned.

01:10:28.532 --> 01:10:29.521
Yes.

01:10:30.033 --> 01:10:31.694
Well, you cloned the wrong man.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.872
How did you do it? You had
to have my-- What do you call it?

01:10:36.106 --> 01:10:37.903
Your syncording. We had it.

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:39.097
Give it to me.

01:10:39.309 --> 01:10:40.537
l want my life back.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:55.451
Here. lt's your syncording.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.284
How did you get this?

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:01.457
-l haven't been--
-Here.

01:11:06.236 --> 01:11:07.396
The vision test.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:10.106
lt didn't test vision.
lt took your syncording.

01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:12.241
An exact picture of your mind.

01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:17.243
And it took sample of DNA. With those
we can clone a person in 2 hours.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:21.474
We had you so we could act quickly
when we were told you were killed.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:23.813
Told l was killed?

01:11:49.646 --> 01:11:51.637
Please don't drink and drive,

01:11:53.016 --> 01:11:54.677
Gibson family schedule,

01:11:54.952 --> 01:11:56.943
Clara's recital at school,

01:12:01.158 --> 01:12:03.319
This is Michael Drucker's.

01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:07.028
A syncording contains everything
in a person's memory...

01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:10.632
...and this is what Drucker saw
and heard just before he died.

01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:14.065
You don't become a rich man
without making enemies...

01:12:14.271 --> 01:12:16.296
...so we back up his mind religiously.

01:12:25.182 --> 01:12:27.810
-You own the Roadrunners, right?
-Among other things,

01:12:28.018 --> 01:12:30.680
-You a fan?
-l'm a fan ofboth those teams,

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.788
l'll have to getyou some tickets,

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.991
-Promise, right?
-Sure, l'll do it right now,

01:12:36.193 --> 01:12:39.492
Sally, remind me to get
Roadrunner tickets forAdam Gibson,

01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:41.027
He's mypilot today,

01:12:42.165 --> 01:12:44.690
On the sixth day, God created man,

01:12:45.335 --> 01:12:49.203
l'm about to get on my snowboard--
Hey, he's got a gun!

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.872
Shit, lt's a fundamentalist,

01:12:53.076 --> 01:12:55.977
Hejust shot them both,
Call Marshall, You hearme?

01:12:56.179 --> 01:12:57.407
Sally? Oh, shit,

01:12:57.681 --> 01:12:59.581
No, you don't have to-- Sally!

01:12:59.783 --> 01:13:00.807
Help!

01:13:01.985 --> 01:13:05.648
An anti-cloning fundamentalist
killed everyone on board.

01:13:06.823 --> 01:13:08.154
lt should have been me.

01:13:08.392 --> 01:13:11.259
We thought it was you.
Drucker even mentioned your name.

01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:14.521
So, we used your DNA and syncording
to clone you.

01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:16.858
To resurrect him,
we had to cover it up.

01:13:17.067 --> 01:13:18.193
Keep talking.

01:13:18.402 --> 01:13:22.270
We cloned everyone. We realized
you switched places too late.

01:13:22.472 --> 01:13:24.736
Access denied, lnvalid thumbprint,

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:27.410
-They're trying to kill me.
-There are two Adam Gibsons.

01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:29.841
That's proof humans
are being cloned...

01:13:30.047 --> 01:13:32.538
...which makes you very dangerous
to Drucker.

01:13:32.749 --> 01:13:35.377
-Accessing security,
-Tell me why l'm a threat.

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:38.679
Drucker was killed 3 years ago.
We cloned him then...

01:13:38.889 --> 01:13:41.050
-...and we cloned him yesterday.
-So?

01:13:41.258 --> 01:13:43.886
lf that came out, he'd be
destroyed in every way.

01:13:44.728 --> 01:13:47.925
A clone has no rights,
A clone can't own anything,

01:13:48.131 --> 01:13:49.689
Drucker would lose all this...

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.027
...because Drucker would be...

01:13:52.235 --> 01:13:53.224
...legally dead.

01:13:54.538 --> 01:13:57.063
Look at all the cameras
you got in this place.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.668
You can't find one guy?

01:14:00.177 --> 01:14:01.337
There. There.

01:14:01.545 --> 01:14:04.571
We don't need where he's been.
We need to find where he is.

01:14:11.722 --> 01:14:13.087
Let's go. Hit the alarm.

01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:15.258
-What's up?
-What area's so sensitive...

01:14:15.459 --> 01:14:16.892
...we don't allow cameras?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.650
Drucker will do anything--

01:14:18.862 --> 01:14:21.353
Anything to destroy the evidence.

01:14:22.265 --> 01:14:24.062
And you're the evidence.

01:14:25.869 --> 01:14:27.632
This is evidence too.

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:29.533
Move! Clear the way!

01:14:30.674 --> 01:14:31.698
Let's go.

01:14:46.723 --> 01:14:49.157
-l have to go to the bathroom.
-Okay, Clara.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.418
Anyone else need to go?

01:15:01.338 --> 01:15:06.002
Why do you think l'm telling you?
Because l can do nothing to stop them.

01:15:06.209 --> 01:15:08.473
-There he is!
-Zone Six. Engineering.

01:15:08.945 --> 01:15:10.742
Move! Clear the way!

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:13.178
Or what they'll do to your family.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:14.441
My family?

01:15:15.118 --> 01:15:19.145
Drucker has to kill one of you. lf he
can't kill you, he'll kill the other.

01:15:19.356 --> 01:15:21.551
They could get killed in the process.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.023
Get out!

01:15:24.227 --> 01:15:26.457
Destination ''Get out'' not understood,

01:15:26.663 --> 01:15:28.927
Morgan Randall Elementary School!

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.842
l'm very sorry, sir.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.759
Daddy!

01:16:08.638 --> 01:16:11.038
She's supposed
to be up there now, right?

01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:13.434
This is the....

01:16:13.643 --> 01:16:14.769
That's odd.

01:16:16.179 --> 01:16:19.012
l'm gonna go check
and make sure everything's okay.

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:21.378
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

01:16:24.054 --> 01:16:25.180
Clara?

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.327
Oh, my God.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:34.790
Mommy!

01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:36.759
Mommy, l'm scared.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.958
l'm here. l got you.

01:16:42.305 --> 01:16:43.294
Could you help us?

01:16:46.309 --> 01:16:47.367
What are you doing?

01:16:47.577 --> 01:16:49.636
This is the only thing
keeping the dogs...

01:16:49.846 --> 01:16:51.541
...from tearing her apart.

01:16:51.748 --> 01:16:54.012
So be quiet and come with us.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.192
Let's go!

01:17:12.202 --> 01:17:13.897
-Daddy!
-Adam!

01:17:20.243 --> 01:17:21.232
Natalie!

01:17:45.235 --> 01:17:47.499
You have reached 911 emergency,

01:17:47.704 --> 01:17:49.899
-Your call is important to us,
-l know.

01:17:50.106 --> 01:17:51.630
Your ''yes'' or ''no'' answers,,,

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:55.072
,,,will help us in directing
police services to assistyou,

01:17:55.278 --> 01:17:57.337
-Are you reporting a felony?
-Yes.

01:17:57.547 --> 01:18:00.607
-Thank you forreporting a felony,
-Come on.

01:18:00.817 --> 01:18:02.717
ls the felony in progress now?

01:18:02.919 --> 01:18:03.908
Yes!

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.712
Thank you,

01:18:05.922 --> 01:18:08.550
ls there a danger ofbodily harm
to you or others?

01:18:08.758 --> 01:18:09.747
Yes!

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.360
Are suspects orinjured victims,,,,

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:15.895
Forget about talking to the police.
l tried that already.

01:18:16.099 --> 01:18:18.693
Who the hell are you?

01:18:18.902 --> 01:18:21.564
l know this sounds insane, but...

01:18:22.405 --> 01:18:23.838
...l'm Adam Gibson.

01:18:24.808 --> 01:18:28.642
We don't have time for you to be
shocked. They have Natalie and Clara.

01:18:28.845 --> 01:18:31.837
-l need your help to get my family.
-They're my family.

01:18:36.152 --> 01:18:37.744
That's for sleeping with my wife...

01:18:39.489 --> 01:18:40.922
...in the damn minivan.

01:18:42.726 --> 01:18:45.593
Yourreport has been canceled
atyourrequest,

01:18:45.962 --> 01:18:48.328
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

01:18:50.433 --> 01:18:51.798
lt's him.

01:18:52.469 --> 01:18:54.937
l believe you have something of mine.

01:18:55.138 --> 01:18:58.266
No, l have everything ofyours,

01:18:58.475 --> 01:19:01.137
l have the syncording
thatproves you're a clone,

01:19:01.344 --> 01:19:02.902
l have everything of yours:

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:05.581
Your family in the palm of my hand.

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:07.943
-Shall we trade?
-You read my mind,

01:19:08.518 --> 01:19:09.712
Just the highlights.

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:12.911
All right, l'll bring the disk,,,

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.286
,,,to the Double X Charter office
at 10;00 tonight,

01:19:16.493 --> 01:19:18.290
Be there with my family,

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:29.329
Did you have to hit me that hard?

01:19:29.539 --> 01:19:32.064
l had to stop you
from talking to the police.

01:19:32.275 --> 01:19:33.970
That's a good one.

01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:36.373
That should do it.

01:19:38.448 --> 01:19:39.676
What are you doing?

01:19:39.883 --> 01:19:42.875
Testing it. l don't think
you have enough aluminum.

01:19:43.353 --> 01:19:47.221
Are you kidding? That's the same
amount l used in the Rain Forest War.

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.320
You shouldn't be talking.

01:19:50.527 --> 01:19:52.995
The mess you left
trying to fix your garage....

01:19:53.396 --> 01:19:55.921
-You saw me working in the garage?
-Saw you?

01:19:56.132 --> 01:19:57.724
l nearly shot you.

01:20:02.572 --> 01:20:03.903
Let's try it.

01:20:22.492 --> 01:20:24.187
-Cool.
-Cool.

01:20:27.964 --> 01:20:30.262
You better be miles away
when this goes off.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.967
l'm worried about getting inside
to find Natalie and Clara.

01:20:34.604 --> 01:20:36.970
l'll take my chances getting out.

01:20:39.843 --> 01:20:40.832
Griffin.

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:42.102
Here.

01:20:42.946 --> 01:20:45.779
-What are you doing?
-Yours. Yours.

01:20:46.549 --> 01:20:48.380
Griffin, what's the matter?

01:20:49.152 --> 01:20:50.779
My wife, Katherine, is dead.

01:20:50.987 --> 01:20:53.080
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:20:54.624 --> 01:20:56.649
Griffin, l don't know--

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.088
l'm so sorry.

01:20:58.294 --> 01:21:01.127
Don't start with ''sorry'' with me.
Don't start!

01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:03.765
Don't start with ''sorry''!

01:21:04.534 --> 01:21:07.560
l know about the congenital defects
you've been imbedding...

01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:09.170
...into the clone DNA.

01:21:09.372 --> 01:21:12.466
There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix
and the others.

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:15.374
But, Michael, why my wife? Why?

01:21:15.578 --> 01:21:17.170
You're right, Griffin.

01:21:19.816 --> 01:21:23.547
lt's a security protocol l implemented.
l knew you wouldn't understand.

01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:25.584
What should l understand?

01:21:25.789 --> 01:21:27.916
The only thing l understand is that...

01:21:28.591 --> 01:21:30.559
...you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.852
Calm down.

01:21:32.495 --> 01:21:35.259
Someone made a mistake.
This wasn't meant to hurt her.

01:21:35.465 --> 01:21:37.262
lt didn't hurt her. lt killed her.

01:21:37.467 --> 01:21:40.959
Suppose we clone a senator who
agrees to support us, then doesn't.

01:21:41.171 --> 01:21:45.471
Or Johnny Phoenix wants more money.
Shorter life spans gives us leverage.

01:21:45.675 --> 01:21:47.006
What's the point?

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:50.407
The point is, if they betray us
they're dead.

01:21:50.613 --> 01:21:53.377
lf they stay on the team,
we clone them again.

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:57.178
Exactly what we'll do with Katherine.
l'm sure she's being cloned now.

01:21:57.387 --> 01:21:58.376
No, she's not.

01:21:59.355 --> 01:22:00.947
-No.
-She's--

01:22:02.025 --> 01:22:04.016
Griffin, it was a mistake.

01:22:04.694 --> 01:22:08.095
lf you're concerned about her DNA,
go through it yourself.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.630
Obviously there's no charge
for the cloning.

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:13.701
No charge. Thank you very much.

01:22:13.937 --> 01:22:16.963
What you don't understand
is, she doesn't want to be cloned.

01:22:17.173 --> 01:22:18.197
So, do it anYWay.

01:22:19.209 --> 01:22:21.541
Do it anYWay. l see.

01:22:22.545 --> 01:22:24.979
Let me explain something to you.

01:22:26.716 --> 01:22:28.684
l loved my wife very much.

01:22:28.885 --> 01:22:31.752
So much so, l promised
l'd never bring her back again.

01:22:32.055 --> 01:22:33.716
And l won't.

01:22:34.724 --> 01:22:38.319
And if l can't bring her back,
l'll never bring back anyone, ever.

01:22:39.863 --> 01:22:41.728
That's how much l loved her.

01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:46.364
So, it's over, it's finished...

01:22:46.569 --> 01:22:48.059
...and l quit.

01:22:49.639 --> 01:22:51.869
Well, l can't let you quit.

01:22:52.075 --> 01:22:54.407
l've looked the other way too often.

01:22:54.611 --> 01:22:56.909
l've justified too much, so...

01:23:01.918 --> 01:23:04.512
...l'm finished. lt's over.

01:23:08.591 --> 01:23:12.357
-Know what l'm going to do for you?
-What are you going to do for me?

01:23:13.263 --> 01:23:14.594
l'm going to give you...

01:23:15.465 --> 01:23:17.626
...the greatest gift you can imagine.

01:23:18.134 --> 01:23:20.102
-A gift?
-l'm gonna save your life.

01:23:20.303 --> 01:23:24.433
l'm gonna save Katherine's life.
l'm gonna save our friendship.

01:23:24.641 --> 01:23:26.609
And l'm gonna save your marriage.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.535
What are you talking about?

01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:34.482
l'm gonna kill you now...

01:23:34.684 --> 01:23:37.983
...and l'm going to clone you
using your latest syncording.

01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:41.384
Then l'll clone Katherine
using her last syncording.

01:23:41.624 --> 01:23:43.114
You understand?

01:23:43.793 --> 01:23:45.886
Do you see what l'm doing for you?

01:23:46.496 --> 01:23:50.455
You'll be together, neither of you will
remember you promised not to clone her.

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:51.964
Or that she even died.

01:23:52.802 --> 01:23:55.270
Obviously you won't remember
this conversation.

01:24:04.647 --> 01:24:05.978
You're welcome.

01:24:29.172 --> 01:24:31.436
All right, now show me my family,

01:25:01.537 --> 01:25:04.370
Bastards. l knew it.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.163
Yoursyncording isn't here,

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.367
lt was being flown by remote.

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.504
Both of you, get back here now.

01:25:37.073 --> 01:25:38.734
Come on.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.383
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here.

01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:56.285
l'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:03.624
lt's my charter contract.

01:26:10.106 --> 01:26:13.041
Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker,
but we'll stay alert.

01:26:13.242 --> 01:26:14.937
What time are you taking off?

01:26:15.144 --> 01:26:16.702
Take off? l didn't order--

01:26:16.913 --> 01:26:18.881
Yourpilot's on his way to reception,

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:22.681
Now you listen to me.

01:26:22.885 --> 01:26:25.080
Seal the building,
Full security alert,

01:26:25.321 --> 01:26:28.051
Find this pilot,
He is armed and dangerous,

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:31.387
And get Wiley and some men
up to my office now,

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:35.425
Freeze the elevators. Shut down
level 2 and 3 parking garages.

01:26:35.965 --> 01:26:38.559
-Zone 6, engineering corridor.
-There. Sector 3.

01:26:42.438 --> 01:26:45.430
He's headed right towards you, Dan.
Turn around!

01:26:47.009 --> 01:26:47.998
Don't try it.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.235
Get people up the stairwell!

01:26:52.949 --> 01:26:55.417
Teams 3 and 4, close off on him!
Let's go!

01:27:13.302 --> 01:27:16.430
-He shot out a power box.
-He's trashing the whole system.

01:27:16.639 --> 01:27:20.006
We got him trapped.
West stairwell between 1 3 and 14.

01:27:26.682 --> 01:27:27.842
Let's go!

01:27:33.956 --> 01:27:36.015
Cover the stairwell doors!

01:27:40.363 --> 01:27:41.990
Fire in front of him!

01:27:49.038 --> 01:27:50.335
Okay!

01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:52.502
You did pretty good!

01:27:52.708 --> 01:27:54.403
Fooled us at the airport!

01:27:55.144 --> 01:27:57.874
Managed to turn this place
into shambles!

01:27:58.147 --> 01:27:59.580
You're the greatest, Dad!

01:28:02.919 --> 01:28:05.149
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.

01:28:05.354 --> 01:28:08.551
And, of course,
we do have your family!

01:28:11.027 --> 01:28:12.016
All right.

01:28:13.095 --> 01:28:14.653
Go get him.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.389
Well, well.

01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:24.267
-Adam Gibson.
-l wish l could say, ''the one and only.''

01:28:24.774 --> 01:28:27.106
Looks like we both went back
on our word.

01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:30.673
-You'll find we have more in common--
-Where's my family?

01:28:31.247 --> 01:28:32.339
Right to business.

01:28:33.282 --> 01:28:35.011
An admirable trait.

01:28:38.154 --> 01:28:40.622
There they are. All safe and sound.

01:28:40.823 --> 01:28:42.017
For the moment.

01:28:43.059 --> 01:28:45.584
Your syncording is not on him...

01:28:45.795 --> 01:28:47.353
...it's not in his whisper craft.

01:29:00.643 --> 01:29:04.079
l knew you'd double-cross me,
so l gave it to my clone.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.578
Anything happens to me or my family...

01:29:06.782 --> 01:29:10.218
...the next time you see it
will be at your murder trial.

01:29:11.988 --> 01:29:13.615
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.

01:29:14.056 --> 01:29:15.489
Tell me what?

01:29:17.026 --> 01:29:19.290
Adam, Adam, Adam.

01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:23.421
He's not the clone.

01:29:27.136 --> 01:29:28.125
You are.

01:29:31.407 --> 01:29:32.965
Ask yourself something.

01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:36.939
You remember anything
after being scanned by my bodyguard?

01:29:37.146 --> 01:29:39.808
l need to check your vision,
Place your chin here,

01:29:40.016 --> 01:29:42.348
Changing places with your friend?

01:29:42.551 --> 01:29:46.009
Buddy, wake up, We're here,
Woodland Mall,

01:29:46.656 --> 01:29:49.216
The salesman at RePet
thought it was...

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:52.189
...odd you came in twice.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:54.290
Asked the same questions...

01:29:54.497 --> 01:29:55.657
...twice.

01:29:56.232 --> 01:29:58.257
Still can't make up yourmind, huh?

01:29:59.802 --> 01:30:01.326
You lost a dog, right?

01:30:02.805 --> 01:30:04.739
Let me see your chin,

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:07.102
You cutyourselfshaving,

01:30:07.977 --> 01:30:09.035
Your shaving cut?

01:30:10.179 --> 01:30:12.170
Easily reproduced.

01:30:13.849 --> 01:30:16.283
So is the scar
from your old war wound.

01:30:19.121 --> 01:30:20.782
l know who l am.

01:30:21.123 --> 01:30:22.454
l know you do.

01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:24.623
Talia?

01:30:24.827 --> 01:30:26.795
How many times have you been cloned?

01:30:26.996 --> 01:30:28.987
l've lost count.

01:30:29.198 --> 01:30:30.859
There's one way to tell.

01:30:31.867 --> 01:30:33.129
Show him.

01:30:35.371 --> 01:30:38.033
lt's the only way to track
what generation a clone is.

01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.836
See? Four dots means...

01:30:41.043 --> 01:30:43.102
...she's been cloned four times.

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:44.301
Come on.

01:30:44.513 --> 01:30:46.481
Let's take a look at yours.

01:30:47.316 --> 01:30:48.840
Take a look in the mirror.

01:30:49.051 --> 01:30:51.986
Let's find out if you are
who you think you are.

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:02.129
Just under your left eye.

01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:18.279
Kind of takes the fun
out of being alive, doesn't it?

01:31:19.982 --> 01:31:21.279
So, you see...

01:31:21.484 --> 01:31:23.509
...your family
isn't really your family.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.509
They're his.

01:31:26.355 --> 01:31:29.847
And you, my friend, are in exactly
the same boat as all of us.

01:31:37.333 --> 01:31:40.461
lf Adam Gibson gets that syncording
to the authorities...

01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:42.068
...we'll all be destroyed.

01:31:42.838 --> 01:31:45.466
lf you really love
your wife and kid...

01:31:45.674 --> 01:31:48.142
...you'll tell me
where Adam Gibson is.

01:31:48.544 --> 01:31:51.672
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

01:31:52.314 --> 01:31:54.441
You'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:59.821
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

01:32:00.322 --> 01:32:02.552
They'll never know you're the clone.

01:32:05.761 --> 01:32:07.353
That, or lose them forever.

01:32:07.563 --> 01:32:11.465
Adam, l'm not making this offer
because l have to.

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:13.794
l can get everything
from your memories.

01:32:14.003 --> 01:32:16.403
The fact is,
l'd like you to understand...

01:32:16.605 --> 01:32:18.732
...you'd be serving a higher purpose.

01:32:19.842 --> 01:32:24.108
ln two years, three tops, l'll control
enough votes to get the laws changed.

01:32:25.047 --> 01:32:29.211
Then we won't have to lose our best
people. Our Mozarts...

01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:30.908
...our Martin Luther Kings.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.089
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

01:32:36.025 --> 01:32:39.017
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:49.438
And who gets to decide...

01:32:49.438 --> 01:32:51.265
...who lives and who dies?

01:32:52.041 --> 01:32:53.303
You?

01:32:53.876 --> 01:32:55.241
You have a better idea?

01:32:55.444 --> 01:32:56.502
Yeah.

01:32:56.712 --> 01:32:58.111
What about God?

01:32:58.314 --> 01:33:02.410
You're one of those. l suppose you
think science is inherently evil.

01:33:02.618 --> 01:33:06.281
No, l don't think science
is inherently evil.

01:33:06.622 --> 01:33:08.055
But l think you are.

01:33:09.158 --> 01:33:11.592
lf you believe God created man
in His own image...

01:33:11.794 --> 01:33:14.763
...you believe He gave man
power to understand evolution...

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:18.263
...to exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code.

01:33:18.467 --> 01:33:20.367
To do exactly what l'm doing.

01:33:21.437 --> 01:33:24.167
l'm just taking over
where God left off.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:31.477
lf you really believe that,
then you should clone yourself...

01:33:31.814 --> 01:33:33.509
...while you're still alive.

01:33:33.716 --> 01:33:37.117
Why's that? So l can understand
your unique perspective?

01:33:37.319 --> 01:33:40.482
No. So you can go fuck yourself.

01:33:47.196 --> 01:33:50.825
Now you'll tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!

01:33:54.236 --> 01:33:55.760
You won't find it in my head.

01:33:56.839 --> 01:33:59.672
l told him to hide it
so l wouldn't know where it is.

01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:02.070
-We'll see about that.
-Yeah, we will.

01:34:02.278 --> 01:34:04.075
Let's go. Get in here.

01:34:04.513 --> 01:34:05.810
Come on!

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:07.277
Come on!

01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.544
Come on!

01:34:09.752 --> 01:34:11.549
Fine! Have it your way!

01:34:44.853 --> 01:34:46.445
That didn't hurt so bad.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:49.316
Asshole.

01:34:59.101 --> 01:35:00.762
Let's go back a few minutes.

01:35:07.443 --> 01:35:09.001
Here's Drucker's syncording,

01:35:09.478 --> 01:35:10.775
There's the other one.

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.504
Keep this,

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:15.949
lfl'm not back in an hour,
you know what to do,

01:35:16.885 --> 01:35:20.377
Don't worry, lfanything happens
to you ormy family,,,

01:35:20.589 --> 01:35:23.285
...l'm gonna destroy
that son of a bitch.

01:35:30.699 --> 01:35:32.257
You got the location?

01:35:32.668 --> 01:35:36.069
The airport. l was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.534
Let's go.

01:35:37.906 --> 01:35:39.965
Betrayed by your own mind.

01:35:51.387 --> 01:35:53.184
Wait! Wait!

01:35:54.089 --> 01:35:55.078
What?

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:57.088
They staged that scene for us.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:36:00.194
The other one sat behind him
so we couldn't see him.

01:36:00.396 --> 01:36:03.024
The bastard faked his own syncording.

01:36:03.332 --> 01:36:08.133
One hid and this one avoided looking
at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.

01:36:08.337 --> 01:36:10.134
You mean the other one's here too?

01:36:10.339 --> 01:36:11.636
Yes, that's correct.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.071
Now put out another alert.
This one is the diversion!

01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:23.783
He smashes the cameras,
gets captured...

01:36:23.986 --> 01:36:27.581
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in
and takes his wife and kid.

01:37:08.297 --> 01:37:09.662
ldiot!

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:16.762
Natalie, Clara.

01:37:17.339 --> 01:37:20.069
-Oh, my God. What's going on?
-Daddy?

01:37:28.784 --> 01:37:29.773
Don't worry, sir.

01:37:29.985 --> 01:37:31.145
Get him up.

01:37:32.554 --> 01:37:33.851
l'm scared, Dad.

01:37:34.056 --> 01:37:35.546
What's going on?

01:37:35.758 --> 01:37:39.990
-This isn't because of the cigar?
-No. l'll explain to you later.

01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:50.796
Don't worry. He's not going anYWhere.
We'll get him.

01:37:52.708 --> 01:37:54.141
Wait.

01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:56.307
Talia, you go. You two stay here.

01:37:58.814 --> 01:38:00.611
Have them block all the exits.

01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:02.839
Henderson...

01:38:03.051 --> 01:38:05.519
...seal off the tank area,
levels 6 and 7.

01:38:11.827 --> 01:38:13.761
l'm trying. Give me a minute.

01:38:13.962 --> 01:38:15.930
And get us some power up here.

01:38:17.099 --> 01:38:20.466
Don't move. My daughter
is right inside that door.

01:38:21.103 --> 01:38:24.004
l don't want to expose her
to any graphic violence.

01:38:24.206 --> 01:38:26.766
She already gets enough of that
from the media.

01:38:26.975 --> 01:38:28.602
Put your weapons down.

01:38:29.077 --> 01:38:30.806
Nice and easy. Good.

01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:33.176
Now, when you go inside...

01:38:33.382 --> 01:38:34.371
...you say....

01:38:34.917 --> 01:38:36.942
Have a nice flight, little girl.

01:38:37.419 --> 01:38:39.216
They're friends of Daddy's.

01:38:39.421 --> 01:38:41.389
All right, let's go.

01:38:49.898 --> 01:38:53.664
We'll have a little midnight flight
with Daddy and Mommy.

01:38:53.869 --> 01:38:55.268
There we are.

01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:56.460
All right?

01:38:58.841 --> 01:39:00.468
There you go, sir.

01:39:01.143 --> 01:39:02.440
Wiley.

01:39:02.644 --> 01:39:03.394
Go.

01:39:06.982 --> 01:39:08.973
Wiley, just wait one second.

01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:19.687
Not again.

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:25.698
And don't bring him back.

01:39:25.901 --> 01:39:29.098
Stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.

01:39:29.505 --> 01:39:31.132
God.

01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.433
l'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.

01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:38.438
But what better place, right?

01:39:39.414 --> 01:39:41.712
Henderson? Where's my power?

01:39:42.551 --> 01:39:44.178
Coming on-line now, sir.

01:39:44.386 --> 01:39:47.355
Get all exits blocked, All exits!

01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:52.182
Shit.

01:39:58.467 --> 01:40:00.264
Go start warming up a blank.

01:40:00.469 --> 01:40:03.461
Do a fresh syncording.
l want my mind up-to-the-minute.

01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:56.089
Here it is. This is a fresh one.

01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.418
This will be a complete syncording.

01:41:12.307 --> 01:41:13.774
ls that Talia?

01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:16.175
Go help her.

01:41:17.646 --> 01:41:19.045
We'll find them.

01:42:19.374 --> 01:42:22.207
-What have you got?
-Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.

01:42:22.411 --> 01:42:24.879
Okay, go. Take the back walk.

01:43:36.418 --> 01:43:37.168
No.

01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:50.190
Oh, God.

01:44:40.182 --> 01:44:41.581
Oh, no.

01:45:01.937 --> 01:45:03.632
Take her to your mother's...

01:45:03.839 --> 01:45:05.466
...and stay there until l come.

01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:07.005
Come with us, Daddy.

01:45:07.209 --> 01:45:09.871
l have to help a friend, okay? Bye.

01:45:10.078 --> 01:45:11.340
l love you.

01:45:33.768 --> 01:45:35.565
Wiley, you shot me!

01:45:38.974 --> 01:45:40.635
Oh, right. That was you.

01:45:44.145 --> 01:45:45.510
l've got to get dressed.

01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:51.108
You're not even going to wait...

01:45:51.319 --> 01:45:52.616
...until l die?

01:45:53.154 --> 01:45:54.416
Would you?

01:45:55.423 --> 01:45:56.651
Come on.

01:45:56.958 --> 01:45:58.448
Get it off.

01:45:59.394 --> 01:46:02.158
You got blood on the jacket.
Jesus Christ.

01:46:19.781 --> 01:46:20.941
What?

01:46:26.588 --> 01:46:27.577
What?

01:46:28.924 --> 01:46:30.255
What?

01:46:36.364 --> 01:46:37.353
Look...

01:46:38.533 --> 01:46:40.262
...we can make a deal.

01:46:40.969 --> 01:46:43.938
l didn't do anything to you.
lt was all him.

01:46:45.407 --> 01:46:46.840
Listen to me.

01:46:47.442 --> 01:46:49.910
l can rebuild all this
in a very short time.

01:46:50.111 --> 01:46:51.840
l can still save you, Adam.

01:46:52.047 --> 01:46:53.105
Save me?

01:46:53.315 --> 01:46:57.217
We put defects in the clone DNA
to give them short life spans.

01:46:57.419 --> 01:47:01.185
Want to know what you'll die of?
How long you've got to live?

01:47:01.389 --> 01:47:04.017
We can go right upstairs
and look it up.

01:47:40.161 --> 01:47:41.958
We all have to die someday.

01:47:42.163 --> 01:47:43.653
We don't have to die.

01:47:44.699 --> 01:47:48.863
l'm offering you the chance
to live forever. Never aging.

01:47:49.771 --> 01:47:51.739
Perfect in every way.

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.999
Perfect? Like you?

01:47:55.076 --> 01:47:56.100
Look.

01:47:56.811 --> 01:47:58.278
Here is your ''perfection.''

01:48:06.388 --> 01:48:07.946
Oh, God.

01:48:12.494 --> 01:48:15.463
There's no need to panic.
l can fix this.

01:48:15.463 --> 01:48:17.096
You won't fix anything.

01:48:17.298 --> 01:48:18.765
lt's over. lt's finished.

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.426
lt's finished.

01:48:39.554 --> 01:48:41.647
When l said
you should screw yourself...

01:48:41.856 --> 01:48:44.484
...l didn't mean for you
to take it literally.

01:49:14.622 --> 01:49:16.647
Go after him.

01:49:17.992 --> 01:49:19.687
Get him.

01:49:21.696 --> 01:49:23.061
Check the roof!

01:49:23.264 --> 01:49:24.526
You! Up top!

01:50:40.508 --> 01:50:41.907
Come on!

01:51:05.533 --> 01:51:07.831
-Can you fly this?
-Better than you can.

01:51:08.036 --> 01:51:10.527
Good. Because your shooting sucks.

01:51:19.314 --> 01:51:20.872
Let's get out of here.

01:52:24.512 --> 01:52:25.501
Shit.

01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:36.852
Come on!

01:52:58.413 --> 01:52:59.573
Try to climb over me!

01:53:09.023 --> 01:53:10.650
Come on! Hurry up!

01:53:22.603 --> 01:53:23.592
Come on!

01:53:45.259 --> 01:53:46.317
Shit!

01:54:13.254 --> 01:54:14.949
You know, l keep wondering...

01:54:15.656 --> 01:54:17.715
...am l really human?

01:54:17.925 --> 01:54:19.222
Do l have a soul?

01:54:19.794 --> 01:54:23.127
Well, your DNA scan
came back normal, didn't it?

01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:25.561
Yeah. Zero defects.

01:54:25.767 --> 01:54:28.031
Just like a RePet commercial.

01:54:28.236 --> 01:54:31.171
lf you're not human,
they would have mentioned it.

01:54:34.909 --> 01:54:37.104
All right, enough philosophy.

01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:38.801
l better get going.

01:54:39.013 --> 01:54:41.174
l've got 3 weeks at sea
to figure it out.

01:54:41.382 --> 01:54:43.543
Hurry if you want to see Clara.

01:54:43.751 --> 01:54:47.016
Thanks for letting me say goodbye
to your family.

01:54:47.221 --> 01:54:48.552
Now, wait.

01:54:48.756 --> 01:54:51.350
This is your family too.

01:54:51.793 --> 01:54:54.819
You were willing to die to save them.

01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:57.356
Think about that
while you're at sea...

01:54:57.565 --> 01:54:59.897
...wondering if you're
really human or not.

01:55:00.101 --> 01:55:01.966
Because if that's not being human...

01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:04.161
...l don't know what is.

01:55:06.073 --> 01:55:07.370
Thanks.

01:55:14.048 --> 01:55:15.640
Hello, everybody.

01:55:16.651 --> 01:55:18.642
-Look what l brought.
-A kitty!

01:55:21.656 --> 01:55:24.147
Oh, Sadie.

01:55:24.559 --> 01:55:25.890
l thought that...

01:55:26.093 --> 01:55:27.321
...Hank's cat was a--

01:55:27.528 --> 01:55:28.517
She is.

01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:30.822
But you hate RePets.

01:55:31.032 --> 01:55:33.364
Well, l changed my mind.

01:55:33.568 --> 01:55:35.433
You old softie.

01:55:36.437 --> 01:55:37.836
Can we keep her?

01:55:38.039 --> 01:55:39.472
-Please?
-Of course.

01:55:39.674 --> 01:55:42.643
That's why l brought her home.
Put her down.

01:55:42.844 --> 01:55:43.833
Good.

01:55:44.045 --> 01:55:46.343
Thank you so much.
