00:00.042 --> 00:02.211
[Harry]
Previously on Bosch: Legacy.

00:02.294 --> 00:04.255
[both grunting]

00:06.132 --> 00:08.092
Harry, are you all right?

00:08.175 --> 00:09.844
[Don] I let you sit in as a courtesy,

00:09.927 --> 00:11.137
but you can't be involved in this.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.556
- Don't cut me out of this.
- I'll do what I can.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.141
[Harry] I need you right now.
It's an emergency.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.767
My daughter has been abducted.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.060
What do you mean she's been taken?

00:18.144 --> 00:20.104
The case she was involved with,
a serial rapist.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.565
Cops are calling him
The Screen Cutter. I think he has her.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.066
[Reina] There had been
sightings of a man running

00:24.150 --> 00:26.068
from the scene wearing a luchador mask.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.112
[Harry] Jerry, I have a witness
who saw a guy outside

00:28.195 --> 00:29.905
Maddie's apartment building
the night before.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.907
It's Honey Chandler.
She was visiting Maddie.

00:31.991 --> 00:34.368
You need to set her up with a composite
artist as soon as possible.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.454
- [Honey] That's the guy.
- [Jerry] Are you sure?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
Yeah, it's him. That's the man
I saw outside Maddie's apartment.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.083
His name is Kurt Dockweiler.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.543
[Jerry] He's a city inspector.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.462
Picked his victims
from the neighborhoods he worked in.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.671
Can I help you?

00:46.464 --> 00:47.757
-[Kurt] I believe you can.
-[Jerry] Harry,

00:47.840 --> 00:48.841
you're not gonna believe this.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.677
- Dockweiler just turned himself in.
- [Harry] What did he say?

00:51.761 --> 00:53.512
- He claims he knows where she is.
- [Harry] Jesus.

00:53.596 --> 00:54.680
Tell me she's still alive.

00:58.851 --> 00:59.894
Hello?

01:15.868 --> 01:18.204
Help!

01:18.287 --> 01:19.872
Somebody help me!

01:20.998 --> 01:22.750
- [grunting]
- [banging]

01:23.542 --> 01:25.419
I'm in here! [screaming]

01:31.217 --> 01:33.219
[sobs]

01:40.643 --> 01:42.645

[James] Then if that's all
you're gonna give me,

03:15.321 --> 03:17.531
I'll see what I can do with it.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.335
How did you get so lucky?

03:29.418 --> 03:30.586
[James] Sorry?

03:30.669 --> 03:32.212
Representing that piece of shit.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.175
Mr. Dockweiler is my client.

03:36.759 --> 03:37.885
No need for name-calling.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.763
Serial rapist, now a kidnapper. Spare me.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.098
James Rafferty.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.183
And you are...?

03:44.767 --> 03:48.062
Emmett Archer, district attorney
for the city and county of Los Angeles.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.606
Oh. Sorry. I'm not from around here.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.233
Advise your client to tell us
where Officer Bosch is.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.361
It's his best chance
to avoid dying in prison.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.071
Mr. Dockweiler

03:57.154 --> 04:00.991
is willing to give you her whereabouts...

04:01.075 --> 04:02.785
That would be a smart move.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.747
...in exchange for full immunity
from prosecution.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.376
You gotta be kidding me.
You got some balls.

04:10.459 --> 04:14.171
Her freedom for my freedom
is how he put it.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.839
Well, that's never gonna happen.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.175
Every scumbag in LA would be looking
to snatch someone off the streets

04:18.257 --> 04:19.802
to use as a "get out of jail" free card.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.680
I'm just conveying my client's offer.

04:26.392 --> 04:29.103
Charges for the four rapes,
twenty-five to life each.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.021
Aggravated kidnapping, seven to life.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.650
You stack them all together, he's looking
at over a century behind bars.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.610
So here's our offer.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.362
He gives us Officer Bosch unharmed

04:38.445 --> 04:40.072
and we'll take life off the table.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.198
Give him a chance at parole.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.575
If you can agree not to charge him
with the rapes...

04:43.659 --> 04:45.452
- I can't do that. They'd crucify me.
- [James] ...I can get him

04:45.536 --> 04:47.955
to plea to the kidnapping

04:48.038 --> 04:49.456
with a determinate sentence.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.001
He just-- he doesn't wanna die in prison.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.211
First things first. We need proof of life.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.170
I'll talk to him.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.297
I'll discuss with my staff.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.884
Don't take long. He says
she doesn't have much time.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.512
What the fuck does that mean?
If she dies, he loses his leverage.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.931
Neither of us want that to happen.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.271
So while they negotiate
with this psychotic fuck,

05:12.354 --> 05:14.148
time is running out on my daughter's life.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.108
I swear, Jerry,
if he's done anything to her...

05:16.191 --> 05:18.027
- Don't go there, man.
- I'm already there, partner.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.695
I'm already fucking there.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.823
You have no idea
what I'm feeling right now.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.784
We'll get her back.
Harry, she's gonna be okay.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.079
She's strong. She's smart.

05:29.538 --> 05:30.914
And he needs her alive and well.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.457
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.252
You tell me what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

05:36.378 --> 05:38.756
Get me in that room, Jerry.
He'll tell me where she is.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.132
You know I can't do that.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.926
Keep good thoughts. Stay positive.

05:44.887 --> 05:45.804
I gotta get back.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.098
Listen, Jerry, when I was at his place,

05:48.182 --> 05:49.808
there was dirt and foxtail in his bathmat.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.561
Make sure the lab test--
there's a reason he's washing his boots.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.772
You got it. I'll be in touch.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.073
Whatever you're doing, drop it.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.365
I need you.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.827
[James] Well, I think I can get him
to drop the rape charges

06:08.911 --> 06:10.829
but they're gonna need proof of life.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.999
I'll give the DA proof of life
after we have a deal.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.460
- They need it now.
- Let me spell it out for you.

06:18.295 --> 06:22.424
The cops got a partial print
off the mask and DNA.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.928
It was just a matter of time,

06:26.011 --> 06:27.846
which is why I struck first.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.766
I dictate the terms.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.558
If Archer thinks

06:32.643 --> 06:34.061
the cops will find her

06:34.144 --> 06:36.271
while he hems and haws

06:36.355 --> 06:40.275
and drags his fucking feet,
he's making a mistake.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.237
A fatal mistake.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.197
Fatal for him.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.740
Fatal for her.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.784
What does that mean exactly?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.121
[Kurt] It means, Jimbo, my friend,

06:52.204 --> 06:54.081
I'm calling the shots.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.457
So tell them again,

06:56.542 --> 07:00.838
reiterate, time is of the fucking essence.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.772
[thuds]

08:07.487 --> 08:10.490
[tense music playing]

08:32.011 --> 08:33.013
That him?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.811
[Barrel] James Rafferty,

08:39.895 --> 08:42.022
30 years and 20 pounds ago.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.067
[Crate] Well, not everyone
ages gracefully.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.069
Some of us are just born lucky.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.528
Ain't that the truth?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.614
[engine starts]

08:56.286 --> 08:57.704
[Mo] Dockweiler has come
a blank slate so far.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.164
Not even a birth certificate.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.249
Keep digging.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.001
RHD's got his laptop,
so I checked the cloud and, bingo,

09:03.085 --> 09:05.379
we backed it up. God bless the cloud.

09:05.921 --> 09:06.922
Don't you need a password?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.841
Brother, these days you don't need
a password to get past the Pearly Gates.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.219
I used Caddy Linux to run
a dictionary attack

09:12.302 --> 09:13.512
and, lo and behold, I cracked it.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.764
Maps or location searches?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.766
- [Mo] No.
- GPS tag photos?

09:17.849 --> 09:18.850
Looks like he wiped it pretty good.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.978
- Fuck.
- [Mo] But what I did find

09:21.061 --> 09:22.562
in his search history,

09:22.646 --> 09:24.398
searches for sedatives

09:24.481 --> 09:26.692
including Rohypnol and Ketamine.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.111
Must be how he overpowered her.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.612
Specifically he was looking for a dosage

09:30.696 --> 09:32.864
that would knock someone out
for four to six hours.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.536
So he can take her by car. That could be
anywhere in a 300-mile radius.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.374
- [Mo] It's a start.
- [Harry] No, it's not.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.960
It's a tease. He's fucking with us.
He wanted us to find it.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.254
Otherwise, he would have wiped
that search, too.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.797
[computer chimes]

09:48.880 --> 09:51.091
[tense music playing]

09:53.051 --> 09:55.387
Holy Toledo.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.139
What?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.349
Invading his cloud account
seems to have triggered a video link

09:59.433 --> 10:02.019
that's going out to LAPD
and the local media.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.437
It's labeled Madeline Bosch.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.617
Open it. Do it.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.381
The signal has gotta be coming
from somewhere. Find it.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.552
[Mo] Video feed's host is on the dark web.
It's untraceable.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.763
- There has to be a way.
- [Mo] Maybe NSA could do it,

10:37.846 --> 10:39.765
but convincing them is gonna take time.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.143
Which we don't have.

10:53.195 --> 10:56.365
[reporter] We are following
a breaking news out of Los Angeles.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.116
Local news stations across the county

10:58.200 --> 11:02.579
have received [indistinct]
a live video feed

11:02.662 --> 11:04.539
of the missing LAPD officer,

11:04.623 --> 11:06.083
Madeline Bosch.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.127
The [indistinct] the feed
is most likely live

11:09.211 --> 11:10.921
and not recorded footage.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.673
It is reported that LAPD also received

11:13.757 --> 11:17.177
the same [indistinct] new stations.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.763
The message received creates alert.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.099
- [indistinct] Madeline Bosch.
- [line ringing]

11:22.182 --> 11:24.101
[Harry]
Harry Bosch. Leave me a message.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.856
Harry, thinking of you
and Maddie, obviously.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.403
Please call me if there is anything
in the world I can do.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.238
Anything.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.957
Where the hell did this video come from?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.750
Dockweiler must have released it.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.169
From a holding cell?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.004
I don't know how but I can guess why.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.757
He's ratcheting up the pressure
on the DA to make a deal.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.135
We don't even know that this is live.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.637
For all we know, she's dead.
This guy is playing us.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.806
She's alive until we know otherwise.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.392
You better hope so.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.731
[line ringing]

12:12.482 --> 12:15.235
- [Harry] Harry Bosch. Leave me a message.
- [sighs]

12:15.819 --> 12:17.821
Harry, call me.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.949
I got the lab results
from Dockweiler's bathroom.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.505
[phone ringing]

12:36.965 --> 12:38.049
Hollywood station.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.093
This is RHD Detective Baston.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.178
Who's this?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.221
- Officer Onaki.
- [Harry] Okay, Onaki,

12:43.305 --> 12:45.515
listen, I need you to take Kurt Dockweiler

12:45.599 --> 12:47.684
in the interview room.
I need to swab him again.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.436
No problem. I'm gonna tell
the watch commander that...

12:49.519 --> 12:50.729
[Harry] I already spoke to him.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.441
If I have to wait a second,
it's going in my report. We clear?

12:54.524 --> 12:55.650
[Officer Onaki] Yes, sir.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.946
[engine starts]

13:31.728 --> 13:33.104
[grunts]

13:38.109 --> 13:40.529
[panting]

13:44.908 --> 13:46.284
Fuck!

13:55.835 --> 13:56.962
[clicks]

14:01.841 --> 14:02.926
[beeps]

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
[Kurt]
You're wasting your time.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.784
I said I'm not talking to you
until I speak to my lawyer.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.411
Ow!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.373
Where is she?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.335
Harry Bosch.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.462
I walked you through my house.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.173
How you made entry, clear the rooms

14:42.757 --> 14:44.676
like you were still a detective.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.971
But you had no idea
that I was right behind you.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.641
- I figured you now, shitbrain.
- Ow!

14:52.851 --> 14:55.312
I'm the only person
who knows where she is.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.272
If you kill me, you'll never find her.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.025
Help! Help!

15:00.108 --> 15:02.068
This guy is fucking crazy!

15:02.152 --> 15:03.820
You listen to me, motherfucker.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.657
You have two eyes
and two chances to tell me the truth.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.826
Now where is my daughter?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.453
Fuck you.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.830
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Harry!

15:13.913 --> 15:15.165
Let him go.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.208
- Harry.
- Don't!

15:17.292 --> 15:20.920
[Jerry] Harry, you can't help us
find her from a jail cell.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.672
Harry, you don't wanna do this.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.216
But I do.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.971
Harry, think about her.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.821
[Kurt] I want my lawyer.
Give me my lawyer!

15:46.905 --> 15:48.323
He attacked me!

15:48.406 --> 15:49.407
Give me my lawyer now!

15:49.491 --> 15:50.492
You gotta get out of here right now.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.576
Something he said in there,

15:51.660 --> 15:53.203
that fucker knows how cops clear rooms.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.205
Find out if he has any affiliations
with law enforcement.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.498
Will do. Come on.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.250
I got your message. Lab reports.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.711
High levels of sodium chloride, salt,

16:02.170 --> 16:04.422
along with calcite and gypsum and borax.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.716
The desert.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.884
He took her to the desert.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.344
You gotta go.

16:13.598 --> 16:14.933
You hear that right?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.185
[Kurt]
Come on. He's getting away.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.066
Harry Bosch just tried to kill me.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.819
Harry was here?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.112
He assaulted me.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.822
He tried to poke out my eyes.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.824
Never happened. He must be off his meds.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.909
Roger. I'll lock him back up.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.288
What are you doing in here anyway?
Who put you in here?

16:37.372 --> 16:38.748
- A cop.
- Bosch?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.750
No. Not Bosch.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.253
- Bosch tried to kill me.
- All right. That's it. Come on.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.839
You're going right back where you belong.
Come on.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.382
- What'd you find on his lawyer?
- [Mo] Not much.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.967
No complaints with the Bar.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.428
Retired a few years ago.
Got a family business.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.846
This is Honey's world.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.973
Send her what you got.
I'll call her from my car.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.183
- [Mo] Copy that.
- Meet me at my office.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.952
[dramatic music playing]

17:25.336 --> 17:27.338
[reporter] ...Dr. Clarence Donovich
to help explain

17:27.422 --> 17:30.425
why a live feed of a kidnap victim
has been made public.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.677
[Reina]
Why aren't we out canvassing?

17:32.761 --> 17:34.304
Running down known associates
of this creep?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.306
RHD's got point. It's bullshit.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.474
We can't just sit here.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.850
What can we do? We're on the clock.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.562
I'm not. Fuck this.

17:49.611 --> 17:53.948
Can anybody hear me? I'm down here!

17:54.032 --> 17:55.575
Please, anyone!

17:55.658 --> 17:57.702
[banging]

17:57.786 --> 17:58.828
Help!

17:59.370 --> 18:01.748
[panting]

18:01.831 --> 18:03.374
Please.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.128
Please.

18:07.212 --> 18:10.507
[panting]

18:25.355 --> 18:28.316
[grunting]

18:35.949 --> 18:38.117
[clattering]

18:38.201 --> 18:39.911
[grunting]

19:05.728 --> 19:07.814
You're a fucking little bitch, huh?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.816
[panting]

19:24.873 --> 19:26.040
[grunts]

19:50.857 --> 19:51.941
I'm looking for Harry Bosch.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.110
He's not here.
Can I help you with something?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.695
Reina Vasquez.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.071
Maddie's training officer.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.198
Oh, Mo Bassi.
I work with Harry.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.367
I talked to him earlier
about The Screen Cutter.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.077
I wanna help.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.538
We could use another set of eyes,

20:05.622 --> 20:07.999
scouring social media
for possible witnesses.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.501
- Any hits?
- Not so far.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.098
She turned over.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.100
Yeah. About 20 minutes ago.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.061
Looks like she's crying.

20:32.649 --> 20:33.858
No.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.318
She's not crying.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.071
She's working.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.784
You get the file from Mo?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.535
[Honey]
On Dockweiler's lawyer? Yes.

20:44.619 --> 20:48.414
He's not a criminal attorney.
He does child welfare cases.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.041
At least, he did.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.918
He hasn't practiced in a decade.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.505
Why would Dockweiler choose a guy like
that to negotiate a complex criminal plea?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.714
It makes no sense.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.509
He's not even from LA. Kern County.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.886
Maybe he's a friend of the family
working pro bono.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.430
We need to figure out
what his connection to Dockweiler is.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.682
[Honey] Of course.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.184
Crate and Barrel have a beat on him.
I'll text you their number.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.268
[Honey] I'll follow up.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.937
- And Harry...
-[Harry] Yeah?

21:11.854 --> 21:12.939
...keep the faith.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.732
She's a survivor.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.403
Yeah, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.866
[panting]

21:55.690 --> 21:58.693
[dramatic music playing]

22:11.372 --> 22:12.457
[Harry]
What are you doing here?

22:12.540 --> 22:13.958
Did something happen?

22:14.042 --> 22:16.627
There's no news.
I just came to help.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.629
[Mo]
She found something on the feed.

22:21.966 --> 22:25.136
Maddie turned away from the camera.
Did it for about an hour.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.055
Looked to me like she was doing something.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.307
And that's when we saw it.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.769
[Reina] She scratched something
in the wood right beside her head.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.188
EDW.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.231
What do you think she was trying to write?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.069
It's her location.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.363
EDW is the airport code
for Edwards Air Force Base

22:44.447 --> 22:47.533
out towards Joshua Tree
and Twentynine Palms.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.369
She must have heard something
or seen something. Maybe...

22:51.788 --> 22:53.039
...a fighter jet.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.624
Can you get the flight paths
of the training missions

22:54.707 --> 22:55.583
out of Edwards yesterday?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.543
Ooh. That stuff is classified.

22:57.627 --> 22:58.711
Since when has that slowed you down?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.506
- I may have a way around.
- Use it.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.132
What about my other problem?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.094
This should work.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.179
Get that flight data.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.312
[grunts]

24:39.395 --> 24:42.231
[panting]

25:05.671 --> 25:06.672
No.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.050
No. No.

25:09.926 --> 25:10.927
No.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.139
No.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.558
No, no, no, no.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.147
[indistinct chatter]

25:33.741 --> 25:35.284
James Rafferty?

25:35.368 --> 25:37.036
- Yes.
- Honey Chandler.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.537
I'm an attorney.

25:38.621 --> 25:41.249
And I will hold you personally responsible

25:41.332 --> 25:43.709
if anything happens to Madeline Bosch.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.006
I want her home as much as you do.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.842
I can see you're working hard
to make that happen.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.981
How do you know Kurt Dockweiler?

26:05.690 --> 26:07.066
He's a client.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.027
From where? Kern County?

26:10.111 --> 26:11.737
Is that where he has Maddie?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.075
I don't know where he has her.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.328
I wish I did.
I don't have any idea where she is.

26:19.412 --> 26:22.748
And, and now you're asking me
to violate attorney-client privilege?

26:22.832 --> 26:26.585
[suspenseful music playing]

26:29.171 --> 26:30.298
[beeping]

26:43.436 --> 26:44.687
Ms. Chandler...

26:45.896 --> 26:49.317
- ...I've been more than civil with you.
- Okay. You're right. You're right.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.569
You don't have to talk to me,

26:51.652 --> 26:53.404
but don't act like we're on the same side

26:53.487 --> 26:56.866
and you're doing everything you can
to bring Maddie Bosch home.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.077
I'll give you two minutes.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.793
[suspenseful music playing]

27:22.391 --> 27:26.103
[James] I've been
Mr. Dockweiler's attorney for many years,

27:26.187 --> 27:28.064
long before these allegations.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.607
Since he was a minor.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.817
They're hardly allegations.
He's confessed.

27:36.781 --> 27:40.159
[James]
Ms. Chandler, I've heard you out.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.286
I told you all I can.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.205
Now I have to go.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.586
[suspenseful music playing]

27:56.008 --> 27:57.259
[elevator dings]

28:07.144 --> 28:08.687
[Honey] I've hold Rafferty
as long as I could.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.314
He's on his way up.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.318
[suspenseful music playing]

28:29.583 --> 28:30.543
[beeps]

28:58.279 --> 28:59.530
[Harry]
Mo, I've got Chandler here.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.657
- I think I know where Maddie is.
- What did you find?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.451
Sealed court records.
Dockweiler was adopted.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.411
His birth name was Adam White.

29:05.494 --> 29:08.038
His birth mother raised him
in a religious cult in the desert,

29:08.122 --> 29:09.498
The Order of Tranquility.

29:09.582 --> 29:13.085
There were allegations of sexual abuse
of minors and he went in the system.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.963
And became Kurt Dockweiler,
rapist and kidnapper?

29:16.046 --> 29:17.590
Yeah. Don't feel sorry for him.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.883
Oh, trust me, I don't.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.927
If I had my way,
they'd string him up by his fucking balls.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.471
So where is she, Harry?

29:23.554 --> 29:25.347
Well, the cult operated
in the Mojave Desert,

29:25.431 --> 29:29.143
a place called Zzyzx, Z-Z-Y-Z-X.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.645
There was a map in the file.
I'm forwarding it to you, Mo.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.564
[Mo] Okay.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.275
I got the flight path data
from Edwards after he took her.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.241
It lines up, Harry. Straight over Zzyzx.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.367
Three square miles of desert.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.911
She could be anywhere.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.955
[Mo] A VPN feed will need a power source
and a place to send a signal.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.457
Both will be nearby.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.751
It's a five-hour drive,

29:53.834 --> 29:55.920
if she even has five hours.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.215
Leave that to me.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.844
[helicopter blades whirring]

30:04.845 --> 30:05.846
I owe you.

30:06.514 --> 30:07.681
Hey, I'm going with you.

30:08.724 --> 30:12.144
You said it yourself, there's three square
miles of desert out there.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.562
You can't do it alone.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.506
[suspenseful music playing]

30:44.843 --> 30:47.846
[helicopter blades whirring]

31:24.258 --> 31:25.384
[weakly] Help.

31:25.968 --> 31:28.721
Somebody help me. I'm down here.

31:29.513 --> 31:33.017
[Harry] If you see anything
in a three-mile radius, radio me.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.486
Divide and conquer.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.821
You go down this way.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.073
I'm gonna check
these structures down here.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.241
Okay.

32:13.724 --> 32:14.850
Maddie?

32:16.310 --> 32:17.811
Maddie?

32:31.867 --> 32:32.868
Maddie?

32:38.499 --> 32:39.500
Maddie?

32:41.085 --> 32:42.419
Maddie?

33:05.275 --> 33:06.652
So what are you, good cop?

33:06.735 --> 33:07.569
[scoffs]

33:07.653 --> 33:09.196
I'm not here to work you.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.615
I mean, what's the point?

33:12.366 --> 33:14.660
It's only a matter of time
before the DA realizes

33:14.743 --> 33:16.453
he's gotta give you what you want.

33:24.211 --> 33:27.214
Most people who end up in here
aren't exactly criminal masterminds.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.799
You know what I'm saying?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.467
So what, are we friends now?

33:31.677 --> 33:34.179
I hope they lock you up
and throw away the key.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.266
But game respects game.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.144
You've been two steps
ahead of us all along.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.688
You really backed us into a corner.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.359
Maddie?

34:00.164 --> 34:01.415
- Harry!
- Yeah?

34:01.498 --> 34:02.916
Come here. Come here.

34:03.792 --> 34:04.752
Check this out.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.929
[suspenseful music playing]

34:16.554 --> 34:18.974
Listen, I'm willing to go to prison,

34:19.600 --> 34:21.726
just not as a sex offender.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.228
For straight-up kidnapping,
you'd get eight years max.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.148
That's how I see it.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.400
Of course, if she dies,

34:29.568 --> 34:31.487
all that leverage goes out the window.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.572
If that's happens, it's on you.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.119
I made sure she has enough air and water,

34:40.454 --> 34:42.080
if you find her in time.

34:42.790 --> 34:43.791
Smart.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.092
[floor creaking]

34:59.640 --> 35:00.682
Clear.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.521
This must be where the signal
is coming from.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.855
Can you get in?

35:08.065 --> 35:09.274
It's locked.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.954
Where is she?

35:29.002 --> 35:30.712
I wanna give you a hint.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.423
You know what an hourglass is?

35:34.508 --> 35:36.969
You turn them over and start the clock

35:37.553 --> 35:41.265
and the sand slowly trickles
down to the bottom half?

35:42.891 --> 35:47.020
That's what they mean
by time is running out.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.195
This might be the DA.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.665
[line trilling]

36:06.748 --> 36:09.585
- [Harry] Jerry?
- Harry, this guy is bedbug crazy.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.628
- I think he's got Maddie underground.
- Why?

36:11.712 --> 36:13.255
[Jerry] He said he made sure
she has enough air

36:13.338 --> 36:16.008
and then he started talking
about sand in an hourglass.

36:16.091 --> 36:16.925
[Harry] Sand?

36:17.009 --> 36:18.719
I tracked her to Zzyzx.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.974
Maybe he buried her here.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.060
[suspenseful music playing]

36:29.479 --> 36:31.607
[air whistling]

37:56.775 --> 37:58.235
[Maddie gasping]

38:10.539 --> 38:11.748
[glass breaking]

38:11.832 --> 38:13.959
[intense music playing]

38:14.459 --> 38:15.460
[phone beeps]

38:17.379 --> 38:18.463
[Honey] Hello?

38:18.547 --> 38:19.798
Hello. Can you hear me?

38:19.881 --> 38:22.009
Yeah, we think we have her. Come back.

38:31.727 --> 38:32.728
Maddie?

38:37.149 --> 38:38.400
Maddie?

38:39.735 --> 38:40.861
Maddie?

38:42.779 --> 38:43.989
Maddie?

38:45.240 --> 38:46.366
Maddie?

38:48.785 --> 38:51.788
I'm here. Can you hear me?

38:51.872 --> 38:53.331
Maddie?

39:02.049 --> 39:03.175
Maddie?

39:03.717 --> 39:04.843
Maddie?

39:32.621 --> 39:33.705
[grunting]

39:51.098 --> 39:51.973
I got you.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.769
I got you. I got you. I got you.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.104
I got you.

39:57.187 --> 40:00.190
[panting]

40:11.076 --> 40:12.077
Sorry.

40:12.994 --> 40:13.995
Sorry.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.786
[dramatic music playing]

41:35.493 --> 41:36.494
How is she?

41:36.578 --> 41:38.538
She's dehydrated.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.460
They got her on a drip and...

41:45.420 --> 41:47.464
...she'll, she'll be fine.

41:48.465 --> 41:49.758
Give her time.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.513
You know, everybody counts
and nobody counts.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.390
That's your thing.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.478
Family counts a little more.

42:04.731 --> 42:05.774
Thank you.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.410
[exhales sharply]

42:18.495 --> 42:21.289
[dramatic music playing]

42:21.998 --> 42:23.708
[breathes deeply]

42:26.503 --> 42:28.296
Found you a nice Airbnb.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.173
Just for a few days.

42:30.257 --> 42:32.801
For as long as you like. No pressure.

42:33.468 --> 42:34.469
You hungry?

42:35.929 --> 42:39.933
Right now I just want a shower,
crawl in a bed for a week.

42:40.016 --> 42:41.434
Well, it's all set up for you.

42:41.518 --> 42:42.560
[dog barks]

42:43.228 --> 42:44.229
[Maddie] Coltrane.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.857
[dog whines]

42:47.941 --> 42:48.984
[Maddie] Hi, buddy.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.280
[Sam]
Someone's excited to see you.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.827
It's good to have you home, Maddie.

42:59.327 --> 43:00.662
Thanks, Sam.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.888
[Harry]
This season on Bosch: Legacy.

43:18.972 --> 43:20.348
David Foster, come with us.

43:20.432 --> 43:22.517
You're under arrest
for the murder of Lexi Parks.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.852
[Maddie]
Why are you working this case?

43:23.935 --> 43:26.938
Because every time I look at her face,
I see your face.

43:27.022 --> 43:28.815
What's up with you? You good?

43:28.898 --> 43:30.317
[Maddie]
Sorry. Just distracted.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.735
Does the job feel the same?

43:33.069 --> 43:33.987
[man] FBI is here.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.697
[Sylvia]
That is quite a coincidence.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.992
Both of you far off the beaten path,
in the same place at the same time.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.577
We'd like to know
what you were doing there,

43:40.660 --> 43:41.786
you and Bosch.

43:41.870 --> 43:43.163
There's an opening in our unit.

43:43.246 --> 43:45.081
I've been looking
for the right person to fill it.

43:45.165 --> 43:45.999
Who is this?

43:46.082 --> 43:47.083
Harry Bosch.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.210
He's the investigator working your case.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.504
You lied to your wife.
You lied to your attorney.

43:51.588 --> 43:53.548
Lie to me and I will walk.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.885
On your knees, now!

43:56.968 --> 43:58.178
[Harry] A crew is a big deal.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.429
Are you sure you're ready?

44:00.513 --> 44:01.765
What's your number?

44:01.848 --> 44:04.225
You're the rock star hacker.
Figure it out.

44:05.435 --> 44:06.394
Freeze!

44:07.145 --> 44:08.313
[Harry] We've got a problem.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.231
The feds have taken over
the Wakefield case.

44:10.315 --> 44:11.399
- [man] Him.
- You're sure?

44:11.483 --> 44:12.400
A hundred percent.

44:12.484 --> 44:13.818
He said, "Boom," and blew up the place.

44:13.902 --> 44:14.944
[Sylvia] Allison Long.

44:15.028 --> 44:17.322
[man] Looks like they partnered up
about six years ago.

44:17.405 --> 44:19.783
[reporter] Do you anticipate
any charges being filed?

44:19.866 --> 44:22.452
Someone is trying
to destroy my reputation.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.037
[Maddie] You've got a federal target
on your back.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.539
I'm worried my own father
is about to crash and burn.

44:26.623 --> 44:27.499
[woman screams]

44:27.582 --> 44:28.958
[intense music playing]

44:29.042 --> 44:31.586
[Edgewood] You're a disgrace
to the badge you used to wear.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.962
I love you, Maddie.

44:34.756 --> 44:36.591
- [tires screeching]
- [crash]

44:36.674 --> 44:38.510
You're not gonna talk to them, are you?

44:40.136 --> 44:41.304
[Honey] We'll see.

44:43.264 --> 44:46.267
[dramatic music playing]
