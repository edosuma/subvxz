00:22.923 --> 00:25.491
The Lord is my
shepherd; I shall not want.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.594
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.929
He leadeth me beside the still
waters.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.731
He restoreth my soul:

00:32.732 --> 00:36.201
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.670
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

00:38.672 --> 00:41.507
I will fear no evil, for Thou
art with me;

00:41.675 --> 00:43.342
I never got to say goodbye.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.610
I know.

00:44.612 --> 00:48.614
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies;

00:48.949 --> 00:50.949
Thou anointest my
head with the oil.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.885
My cup runneth over.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.388
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life:

00:56.390 --> 00:58.891
And I will dwell in the House of
the Lord forever.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.559
Amen.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.043
We're orphans now.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.914
No. You have me.

03:37.751 --> 03:41.853
Remember when she suddenly
kissed our guide in Machu Picchu?

03:42.022 --> 03:44.323
She only did
what we all wanted to do.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.857
I know.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.369
My friends. My friends.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.838
I'd like to make a toast to my
two stepdaughters

03:59.840 --> 04:02.074
who have suddenly
lost their mother.

04:03.077 --> 04:07.713
May we all offer ourselves...
in support to them

04:07.715 --> 04:09.481
through the rough times ahead.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.283
To...

04:11.552 --> 04:17.289
Ceil and Emily, you are both
like my own daughters.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.760
I also would like to thank them
for the beautiful floral arranging

04:21.762 --> 04:23.362
that they have done for
us on this day,

04:23.364 --> 04:26.031
I'm sure that they'll pass out
their business cards

04:26.033 --> 04:28.734
for any of you that are
interested.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.241
Charles!

04:37.945 --> 04:40.345
How are you girls doing?
Are you okay?

04:40.581 --> 04:43.582
We're okay. More importantly how
are you doing?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.752
Oh I'm fine. Need a new job
I suppose.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.787
No. Peter we'll keep you on
won't he?

04:48.789 --> 04:52.491
I don't think so honey. But
don't need to worry about me.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.825
Everyone.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.328
I'm at the piano... Please.

04:57.598 --> 05:02.100
Your attendance. In honor of
Katherine's incredible spirit.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.369
I would like to play for you her
favorite song.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.371
I'd like to do that now.

05:10.244 --> 05:13.278
♪ <i>Nights in White Satin</i> ♪

05:14.281 --> 05:18.283
♪ <i>Never reaching the end</i> ♪

05:18.786 --> 05:21.186
♪ <i>Letters I've written,</i> ♪

05:22.890 --> 05:25.991
♪ <i>never meaning to send.</i> ♪

05:26.160 --> 05:34.232
♪ <i>Cause I love you, yeah.</i>
<i>I love you, yeah. I love you.</i> ♪

06:37.297 --> 06:38.563
Now what?

06:41.335 --> 06:43.602
We move on.
Like we did when Dad died.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.571
Will we have to sell the
business?

06:46.573 --> 06:47.639
No, of course not.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.741
We were taught to work for a
living, right?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.210
What about the house?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.312
Well, Peter will live
there for two years

06:54.314 --> 06:55.514
and then we can sell it.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.551
Doesn't really bother me.
Why, does it bother you?

07:00.187 --> 07:03.088
I guess not.
It just seems unfair.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.723
What's unfair about it?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.691
He made out like a bandit, Ceil.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.693
Alright, she had a
sudden heart attack.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.297
Come on Emily. Do not go there.
You're tired.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.850
I think these would be lovely.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.052
Yes. I'll take them. They're
beautiful

07:34.054 --> 07:34.953
Great.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.224
Ah, is that cash or charge?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.258
Charge please.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.136
Are you okay, honey?

07:51.572 --> 07:56.508
Yeah, I am. I'm sorry.
Ah, just sign here.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.913
- Thank you.
- Thanks

08:01.915 --> 08:03.315
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.296
Why go out to eat if you're just
going to text the whole time.

08:18.432 --> 08:20.131
Maybe they're sexting.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.234
With each other?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.903
Yeah why not.
It's like a thing now.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.311
A woman came
into the shop today,

08:33.313 --> 08:35.514
to get flowers for a friend who
had a heart attack.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.847
Yeah. And?

08:37.417 --> 08:39.885
She looked a lot like mom.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.522
Oh, thank god.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.690
Oh, man.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.161
Why do I do that?
You know I hate olives.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.764
I always forget to
say no to olives.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.165
Did you hear what I said?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.600
Yes, the woman
looked like mother.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.102
Can we stop talking
about it, please.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.471
I'm just sick of being
sad all the time.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.906
Plus we have other
things to worry about,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.575
like the fact that we've been
living together for eight years.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.611
I love you, too.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.178
I mean don't you think it's a
little weird, though?

09:08.181 --> 09:11.016
Don't you want babies someday
running around in your own house.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.686
Babies. I don't see that in my
future, right now.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.423
That is exactly what you need.
You need babies.

09:19.526 --> 09:23.094
Yeah. Oh my God.
Look who's here?

09:25.365 --> 09:26.898
Hey. Look who's here?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.877
Hi Peter.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.745
Ceil, Emily. How come
you two never stop bye?

09:41.848 --> 09:44.249
Charles misses you in a bad way.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.419
So do I.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.721
I'm Suzanne.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.656
Oh, no. Where are my manners?

09:51.658 --> 09:56.795
Suzanne. This is Ceil and Emily.
My two beautiful stepdaughters.

09:58.765 --> 10:03.468
How are you Peter. I see you've
been doing well apparently.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.441
Actually Ceil. I'm ah... not
doing too well.

10:09.576 --> 10:13.612
It's been very very difficult for
me but I'm managing to move on.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.782
The question is, how are
you two holding up?

10:17.918 --> 10:21.753
We're fine, Peter. Taking it one
day at a time.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.823
You know what Emily? We actually
should go visit, Charles.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.125
Maybe look through some
of Mom's old stuff.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.361
We've been putting it off for
too long.

10:29.730 --> 10:34.099
That's an excellent idea. I think
that would be very very, healing.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.134
For both of you.

10:37.371 --> 10:41.306
Please. Just call anytime you
want to stop by the house.

10:41.575 --> 10:45.110
You know your
both welcome. Always.

10:48.048 --> 10:52.117
We got to go. We have some important
antique business to discuss.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.886
So, have a lovely meal. Bye.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.192
Okay.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.296
Wasn't she at the-?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.464
Yeah. The funeral.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.833
God, what do you make of that?

11:09.136 --> 11:13.538
I don't know. But she's definitely
not in the antique business.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.882
Can we go. I kind of
lost my appetite.

11:24.818 --> 11:28.753
Yeah, me too. Can we
have our check, please?

11:44.471 --> 11:47.272
Would you like to join us, Em?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.880
Hey, you ok? I heard screaming.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.718
Yeah. I just had the creepiest
dream about Peter and Mother.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.421
Okay. We'll talk about it in the
morning. I have company.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.236
Good afternoon.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.237
Sorry.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.172
So how was your evening with -

12:21.174 --> 12:22.173
Justin.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.475
A few years your junior, huh.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.811
Perhaps you should try it some time, Em.
You seem a little locked up.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.881
I have more important matters
to attend to.

12:30.484 --> 12:34.319
Oh yeah. Like what? Holding onto our
mother's ghost for the rest of your life?

12:34.321 --> 12:36.688
You would too if you had the
dream I had last night.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.224
Oh, I had a dream.
I'm just not telling.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.094
I can't believe you can be horny at
a time like this. We're grieving.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.930
Well, you grieve your way. I'll
grieve my way.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.101
Fine. You can take care of
things here while I go play.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.637
Fine. Go.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.277
Aren't those pretty? You should
take those. There on sale.

13:48.228 --> 13:52.230
And here it is. This is a goblet
of Jesus.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.804
And you can see inside that there
is a picture of Jesus's face.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.706
Here. Let me show you in back
where the light is better.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.509
Careful, don't step
on the snake.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.376
Is there something that I can
help you with, miss?

15:11.378 --> 15:14.879
I don't know. How do I find out
if someone has a record?

15:15.181 --> 15:18.383
Well that depends. Has this
person broken the law.

15:18.818 --> 15:22.053
I think murder is
breaking the law.

15:22.422 --> 15:27.759
Hey, officer Morgan, I think we can
take over from here. Thanks a bunch.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.229
Ah, Is there something I can
help you with?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.563
Maybe.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.633
Oh, I'm detective Fry.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.068
Emily Scott.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.002
Pleasure.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.238
My sister and I think our
mother was murdered.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.674
Well, she doesn't but I do.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.610
Okay. What would make
you think that?

15:45.612 --> 15:48.846
She married a man 20 years younger
than her. She was perfectly healthy,

15:48.848 --> 15:51.316
and then one day she just drops
dead of a heart attack.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.251
Sorry to hear.

15:53.253 --> 15:57.488
It turns out this guy used to be
a pharmaceutical sales rep.

15:59.759 --> 16:04.529
So, pharmaceutical
sales... you... um...

16:05.131 --> 16:07.298
It's. You know what?
It's fine. Thank you.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.568
Wait. Where are you going?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.770
No. It's okay, detective.
Thank you.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.105
Sorry. I, ahh...

16:15.442 --> 16:17.342
She's not your usual type.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.478
Shouldn't've chased her away
though.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.148
Okay, Hennessy. What is
my usual type?

16:24.150 --> 16:27.852
Millions of piercings. Black eye
makeup. Daddy issues.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.857
Hey I'm just saying,
don't be so picky.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.058
I'm not picky.

16:34.060 --> 16:34.726
Yes you are.

16:34.728 --> 16:35.393
No I'm not.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.862
You are too.

16:37.863 --> 16:40.330
No I'm not. And this conversation is over.
Let's go close some cases.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.356
Lockup when you leave.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.905
Hi. Welcome to Thrive.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.190
Well, great.

17:22.191 --> 17:23.339
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.710
No, I'm, I'm Emily Scott.

17:25.712 --> 17:30.081
I'm actually doing a story on
successful antique dealers in town.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.728
Damn it, Emily.
I almost cut my finger off.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.996
Sorry. Can you sit down?

17:44.998 --> 17:46.564
Can I get a bandaid.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.131
Do you know Peter did before he
was in the antique business?

17:48.134 --> 17:49.467
No and I don't want to know.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.335
He was a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.304
Oh, wow. He wasn't
a secret agent.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.573
Laugh all you want. I see the
connection even if you don't.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.874
What connection?

17:57.343 --> 17:59.844
He sold drugs to
hospitals, to doctors.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.279
Mom had a heart attack, Emily.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.081
I don't think it
was that simple.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.916
My god can we please forget
about him.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.684
Our inheritance is
taken care of.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.486
We never have to
see the guy again.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.922
He might have tampered
with her medication.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.757
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.360
You suspect it too. You just
don't want to believe it.

18:16.362 --> 18:17.862
I said I don't want to talk
about it.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.330
I'm not done talking about it.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.600
Look the guy might look and act
like a creepy game show host

18:22.602 --> 18:24.435
but it doesn't mean
he's a killer.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.305
Ceil, I had another
dream the other night.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.807
Well, dreams are
just dreams, Emily.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.110
I went to the police today.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.247
You did what?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.850
Don't worry. I think they
thought I was nuts.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.487
You are nuts.

18:47.427 --> 18:51.529
So, this is the piece and I, I
think it will be wonderful.

18:51.531 --> 18:55.032
I mean, it's got the blues and it's got
the orange, it's got the hues that we need.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.134
And then I think-

18:56.136 --> 18:57.235
It's a lovely piece.

18:57.237 --> 19:01.205
Oh yes. It would be
lovely in our foyer.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.441
Shall we wrap it up?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.077
No, no. I think we're going to
wait a bit.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.112
You know with the
economy and everything.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.348
I think we're just
looking, thank you.

19:10.650 --> 19:15.453
Okay. Well take your time. Feel
free to look around.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.689
Didn't know you
used to sell drugs.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.392
What?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.662
To doctors I mean. Legit stuff.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.964
How did you know that?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.434
Um, some reporter was in here
asking about you.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.570
Um, Selma had a chat with her.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.405
Where is she?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.306
Who?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.374
Selma.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.509
In the back. I think.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.258
Oh! Oh good. It's you
Mr. Mahoney.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.360
I don't know how to price this
lamp.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.429
We'll decide on that later.
Okay Selma?

19:59.365 --> 20:02.233
Did someone coming last night
and ask about me?

20:02.769 --> 20:06.571
Oh yes. Very nice young woman.
I hope it's ok?

20:06.873 --> 20:11.242
I told her you worked in a bank and
that you were a medicine sales person.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.778
You were, right? You told me
that a few months ago.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.348
She was a writer. She said she
was writing an article

20:17.350 --> 20:20.551
about successful antique dealers
in town.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.789
What did she look like?

20:25.825 --> 20:32.129
Pretty. Kind-a thin. With light
brown hair. Late 20s maybe.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.265
It's hard to tell these days.

20:34.534 --> 20:38.269
I don't think she had any
tattoos or anything.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.305
Kind of a refreshing young lady.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.111
I didn't do anything
wrong, did I?

20:47.347 --> 20:48.646
No.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.881
No. No you didn't.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.084
Just do me the favor

20:53.086 --> 20:57.555
and always ask me before you tell
people stuff about my background. Okay?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.689
Oh yes. Yes.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.325
I am so sorry, Mr. Mahoney.

21:02.428 --> 21:06.264
Well, don't worry. We won't talk
about it anymore. Okay?

21:06.666 --> 21:09.767
Just do me a favor and
don't do it again.

21:10.570 --> 21:15.273
Okay? Okay. You can go get a
sandwich now.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.410
Yes, I agree.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.280
We find that daycare worker when
we locate the perp.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.482
Nice work Jess.

21:25.752 --> 21:29.186
Oh, hey Jess. I got to go.
Something just came up.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.656
Who's the perp at the
daycare center?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.124
Do I even want to know?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.992
Ah. No. You don't.

21:35.762 --> 21:39.864
Um, Have a seat. How'd you get
back here anyway?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.700
Ah, the guy, Hennessey, said I
could come back here.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.168
Ahh. Hennessey.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.704
I have had a question for you.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.472
Of course. Shoot.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.675
What does it take to
exhume a body?

21:51.944 --> 21:54.779
Ahh, a warrant and a very good
reason.

21:55.248 --> 21:59.884
Okay, well this may sound crazy and it
may turn out to be completely trivial

21:59.886 --> 22:01.786
but my mother died in January.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.905
They said it was
a heart attack

22:03.906 --> 22:06.023
but it was just a mitral valve
thingy. It wasn't a big deal.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.292
Did the M.E. do an autopsy?

22:08.294 --> 22:10.561
No. Supposedly she
didn't want one.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.763
What was the official
cause of death?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.131
Heart failure.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.234
And was anyone with
her when she died?

22:17.403 --> 22:20.037
Yes. Peter Mahoney. He's an
antique dealer

22:20.340 --> 22:22.707
and yes I did google him, a lot.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.577
I'd be disappointed if you
didn't.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.113
Like I said before, he was a
pharmaceutical sales rep,

22:29.115 --> 22:32.850
before he met my mother.
He a lot to gain.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.252
I mean he was 20 years
younger than her.

22:35.655 --> 22:39.256
And you think he may have given her
some pills to cause her heart attack.

22:40.193 --> 22:44.762
Maybe. I don't know. Am I crazy?

22:45.164 --> 22:48.232
No, not at all. You're...
concerned.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.906
Um, by any chance did you happen to bring
Peter Mohoney's information with you?

22:56.442 --> 22:58.676
Yes, yes I did.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.551
Thank you.

23:08.654 --> 23:09.854
All right.

23:11.290 --> 23:14.625
You know, um, I'm really not
supposed to be doing this

23:14.627 --> 23:18.796
but I'll run a background check
for you.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.065
Great.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.200
What's the best way to contact
you?

23:23.469 --> 23:24.535
Ah...

23:27.039 --> 23:28.105
Here you go, that's mine.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.075
Oh, you're a florist.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.979
Yeah. So you'll call me if you
find anything?

23:34.981 --> 23:35.980
I will.

23:35.982 --> 23:36.881
Okay, great.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.017
Have an awesome day.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.585
Thanks.

23:42.221 --> 23:45.256
Have an awesome day.
What am I saying?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.581
I don't really feel like playing
Clue tonight, Emily.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.183
Don't want to know what he said?

24:12.418 --> 24:13.317
Nope

24:13.319 --> 24:17.221
He's gonna run a check on Peter.
He's going to help us Ceil.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.722
That's because he wants to get
in your pants.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.224
He's not like that.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.426
Will you stop being so naive.

24:23.029 --> 24:26.363
You know, I really think this is going to
be the last straw between us. I know it.

24:27.033 --> 24:30.100
Maybe I just think we should
sell the business and separate.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.704
We are not selling the business.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.240
We're gonna make whoever killed
our mother pay for it.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.241
What are you doing?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.043
You haven't smoked in years.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.844
You know, I'm going to start
because you're driving me to it.

24:41.481 --> 24:45.082
You're not smoking. You're not drinking.
We need to be centered right now, okay?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.384
Do I have to be celibate, too.
Because that's not happening.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.788
Don't you care about
your mother?

24:50.789 --> 24:53.657
You know, sometimes I don't miss her
at all. She could be a real pain.

25:02.902 --> 25:03.868
I'm going running.

25:03.870 --> 25:07.137
Good for you. It's about time
you started to exercise.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.973
It will help you relax and
maybe move on.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.176
Running doesn't mean
I'm giving up.

25:48.481 --> 25:51.916
Hey there. Can I run with you
for a minute?

25:52.285 --> 25:53.784
Hey Peter, sure.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.720
I'm not as good a shape you are.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.859
How come you're checking
up on me, Emily?

26:01.861 --> 26:05.229
You know I'm an open book - with
you and Ceil.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.463
What are you talking about?

26:06.465 --> 26:09.400
Can we slow down
just a little bit.

26:11.904 --> 26:17.041
What is it you want to know about me?
Just ask. Be happy to tell you.

26:17.376 --> 26:22.146
Nothing. Nothing, Peter. I'm
just doing a family genealogy

26:22.148 --> 26:24.281
and working on a family history.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.585
Oh and you're including my
family. How nice.

26:27.853 --> 26:31.355
Well I can tell you.. everything
about me if you really want me to.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.457
I mean, I feel like, you know,

26:33.726 --> 26:35.926
You and I get along
pretty well if we tried.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.828
Let go my arm.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.231
Oh, it was nice seeing you, Em.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.341
Hey. Hey hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, watch the desk.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.350
Damn.

26:59.885 --> 27:01.218
- Oh.
- Oh. Hey

27:01.220 --> 27:04.188
Sorry, detective.
I tried to stop her.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.324
Oh, don't worry officer Morgan.
She's a friend.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.328
Come on in. Have a seat.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.132
You have to do something.
He followed me.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.100
Who?

27:16.102 --> 27:17.001
In the park.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.135
Who followed you?

27:18.137 --> 27:19.036
Peter.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.855
The Mahoney guy?

27:20.856 --> 27:22.473
The Mahoney guy, yes. Did you
check up on him?

27:23.209 --> 27:28.278
Yes, I found out a little bit,
Ah, he moved around a lot and ah,

27:28.414 --> 27:31.115
I know he was married before,
he's...

27:32.585 --> 27:33.517
Oh...

27:33.819 --> 27:35.319
You didn't know he was married?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.154
No. I was not aware of that.

27:37.623 --> 27:40.858
Well, I'm going to lock down who
she was in a little bit, um,

27:41.160 --> 27:42.826
So what did he say to you?

27:43.095 --> 27:46.163
He asked me why I was checking
in on his past.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.365
And what did you say?

27:48.367 --> 27:53.637
I said that I was doing a genealogy
thing, a family history project.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.473
I know. It was really stupid. He
was threatening me.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.242
How did he threaten you?

27:58.511 --> 28:00.611
He grabbed my arm
and he got in my face,

28:00.613 --> 28:05.315
and he said something creepy
about us getting closer.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.584
He was sniffing me or something.

28:08.654 --> 28:12.423
Okay, listen. I really need you
to stay away from this guy.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.759
Alright. I'm going to do a little more
fact checking and I'll give you a call.

28:15.761 --> 28:19.029
But as far as right now is concerned
let's just keep this between us.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.065
Okay

28:22.535 --> 28:25.169
Why are we keeping
it between us?

28:25.771 --> 28:29.707
Because we don't exactly have enough
to open up an official case, yet.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.177
But it's okay. It's just normal
procedure.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.880
As soon as I have something, I am
going to do something about it.

28:38.384 --> 28:43.187
Okay. Thank you for helping
me... us.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.055
No problem.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.794
Be careful.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.401
So he's been married before.
It's not like that's illegal.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.869
But why didn't we know about it?

28:59.071 --> 29:00.471
Because he didn't want us to
know.

29:00.473 --> 29:01.572
What else don't we know?

29:01.974 --> 29:03.874
Other things he doesn't want us
to know.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.577
You're being really obsessive
about this. Do you know that?

29:07.546 --> 29:11.248
Am I obsessing or do I just want to
know what happened to our mother.

29:11.684 --> 29:13.150
Oh, you mean the one who had a
heart attack.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.854
Okay. Sorry. That wasn't funny.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.890
Look, he checked up on you
because you checked up on him,

29:20.025 --> 29:22.893
and he's been married before but that
doesn't mean you have to arrest the guy.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.599
Shit. Did it again.

29:29.201 --> 29:33.103
Look, I don't know how to describe
it but his behavior was really odd.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.339
Yeah, him running is just odd.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.007
Yeah, especially in a suit.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.058
What?

29:38.059 --> 29:39.108
Yeah, he looked ridiculous.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.279
What a goon.
Well your cop's on it, right?

29:43.048 --> 29:46.750
He's not my cop. And now we
don't even have a case yet.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.086
Well, it's good that
he's into you.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.189
I don't... know that he's into
me.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.258
Sure he is. It's good.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.961
Ah, ha ha ha. Your the best.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.632
And with your past, that's a
compliment.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.368
I don't know what you are
talking about.

30:06.071 --> 30:10.174
Okay, so what's up with the
Snoop sisters?

30:10.943 --> 30:13.143
I think I got to Emily this
morning.

30:13.145 --> 30:17.447
She's timid. She's not going to
go anywhere with any of this.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.385
I don't know. You have to watch
out for the timid ones.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.787
Don't worry. I got this.

30:23.789 --> 30:27.791
Yes, but seriously, what about
the other one.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.161
She does seem like a little
flower. She's meaner.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.297
I handled worse.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.565
Really?

30:34.834 --> 30:35.732
Yeah!

30:36.769 --> 30:38.468
Oh, excuse me.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.572
That's Okay Charles. It's not like
we are in the act or anything.

30:43.509 --> 30:47.311
I was just wondering if you still
need me any more this afternoon, sir?

30:47.446 --> 30:48.912
No, I don't think so.

30:48.914 --> 30:49.813
You sure?

30:49.815 --> 30:51.598
Yeah.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.382
Hey. Why don't you take a couple
of bills, I'll treat you to lunch.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.688
No thank you, sir.
I can buy my own lunch.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.056
Suit yourself.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.260
I think you offended the help.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.194
Like I care.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.629
Oh, you bad boy.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.332
I'm going to fire him, but not right now.
It wouldn't look good.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.174
Just a few more months. Okay? I
got to the work now.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.243
And then we can get out of here.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.345
Ah, I hope so.

31:41.133 --> 31:45.636
Can see right, right there.
Alright.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.972
Hey, well just hold onto that and
we'll we'll play some more, okay?

31:49.909 --> 31:51.108
Can I help you sir?

31:51.377 --> 31:53.644
Ah, no. I'm just looking around.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.480
But you have some really
wonderful stuff here.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.751
Thank you. Well, I'll let you
browse some peace.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.686
Just let me know if you
have any questions.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.587
I will.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.760
Where were we. Ah.
Let me show you this.

32:09.762 --> 32:16.066
This is an obelisk of fun.
Yeah. Yes. Ancient Egyptian.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.602
And if you can see right on
the bottom it's described here.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.470
This might help again.
Just take a look.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.210
Hey.

32:27.212 --> 32:28.612
Hi, I'm working.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.864
There's no one here.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.181
Yeah, you should have seen
it an hour ago.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.250
Oh, yeah. Busy bee?

32:33.252 --> 32:34.284
- Yep.
- Hi.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.185
Hi.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.488
Hey, so when do I
get to meet your sister?

32:38.624 --> 32:41.091
I don't want you to meet her.
She's the pretty one.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.527
Yeah, but I bet she can't do that
thing you do with your tongue -

32:43.529 --> 32:44.728
Emily, this is Justin.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.130
Oh hey. Hi. Nice to meet you.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.799
Hi Justin. I've heard a lot.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.300
All bad I hope.

32:50.769 --> 32:51.935
I have to talk to you about this
morning.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.470
What about this morning?

32:53.639 --> 32:54.638
It's private.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.273
Anything can say to me
you can say to Justin,

32:56.275 --> 32:58.642
he knows all about your
suspicions of step daddy.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.110
It's true. I know all about it.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.547
I don't want to talk about this now
but I'm going to meet Charles tonight

33:03.549 --> 33:04.948
and I think you
should come along.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.483
Whoa. You're going to Peter's
house?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.618
Our house. Peter and Buffy are
out for the night

33:10.255 --> 33:12.239
and I'm going to take a look
around.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.224
Well, we have plans. Right? But
Emily please don't.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.460
Sorry ...Bye.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.561
Nice to meet you.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.697
My sister is crazy.

33:20.833 --> 33:21.898
A little bit.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.206
Coming, coming.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.143
Hi.

33:33.145 --> 33:33.944
Hi.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.012
No one's here right, Right?

33:35.014 --> 33:36.246
Right as rain.

33:36.615 --> 33:37.748
No Ceil?

33:38.017 --> 33:40.717
I'm afraid not. Ceil thinks I'm
wasting my time.

33:40.986 --> 33:44.488
You let me talk to her about that man.
I'll straighten her out.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.690
It's fine. I just want to get
this over with.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.058
Sure thing.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.465
What are you looking for?
Maybe I can help.

33:55.467 --> 34:01.071
Anything that doesn't belong here.
I don't know exactly. Pills?

34:25.397 --> 34:26.830
Go down and distract them.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.031
- How?
- Shush

34:29.034 --> 34:31.534
Hit him with a bat or something.
They can't find me here.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.503
Why not? This is still your
house.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.704
Just go.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.581
You two change your mind
about the movie?

34:44.750 --> 34:45.649
Yeah.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.884
We decided we'd rather
blow each other up.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.485
than watch a stupid Hollywood
movie

34:49.487 --> 34:50.520
do the same.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.922
I thought you were going out?

34:51.924 --> 34:54.458
I still am. Just running a
little late.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.525
Some wine maybe?

34:56.527 --> 34:59.329
No thanks... Are you alright,
Charles?

34:59.498 --> 35:02.966
Oh yeah. Right as rain.
You bet.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.946
- No no. Bend over.
- Okay.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.751
Ready for your Vularian steel?

35:21.753 --> 35:23.587
Oh yes my lord.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.097
Yes, Hennessy.

35:34.099 --> 35:37.300
<i>Hey, just a heads up. The captain is
asking about what we're working on.</i>

35:37.769 --> 35:38.969
Duly noted, Hennesy.

35:38.971 --> 35:43.473
<i>Hey we got a lot of work. Why don't
you get your dick out of your work.</i>

35:43.976 --> 35:48.345
Thank you so much for your candor, Hennesy.
I very much appreciate it.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.294
Jeez, what happened to you?

36:14.006 --> 36:16.139
I haven't heard of most of
these.

36:16.141 --> 36:17.607
Did you come home last night?

36:17.609 --> 36:18.608
I'm afraid not.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.310
Wait. Did you--?

36:20.311 --> 36:22.011
Spent the night in mom's closet.
Grabbed these out of the bathroom.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.815
I had to listen to Peter and Suzanne
act out a scene from "Games of Thrones".

36:26.952 --> 36:28.435
It was terrifying.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.919
Wow. You are dedicated. I will
give you that.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.005
What are you doing?

36:32.006 --> 36:34.089
The roses have aphids and the
nicotine is eating through the paper.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.430
Call 911.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.333
Jesus, it's nice to
see you, too.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.836
We refuse service to you.

36:46.838 --> 36:47.938
Don't do that.

36:47.940 --> 36:50.574
Get off her!

36:50.575 --> 36:53.209
God help the men you two end up
with, or the women for that matter.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.814
Hey, I'll have you know Ceil has a
boyfriend and I think I might too

36:57.816 --> 36:59.182
and he happens to be a cop.

36:59.184 --> 37:01.551
You two have been snooping
around in my private life

37:01.553 --> 37:04.788
and you've been harassing my
Honey-bunny and I don't like it.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.357
You two spoiled shits need to
learn some manners.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.792
Owww!

37:10.963 --> 37:14.331
Don't you think you are
overreacting just a little bit.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.133
Tell us Peter, did you have anything
to do with our mother's death?

37:17.135 --> 37:20.737
I don't know. Does banging an
old broad cause a heart attack?

37:21.373 --> 37:23.707
Oh hey. What are we celebrating?

37:24.042 --> 37:26.243
I think it's a little early to
be drinking, isn't it?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.313
Ahhh. To the modern
day snoop sisters.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.482
A couple uptight bitches that
couldn't attract a fly.

37:34.186 --> 37:35.919
I said I wouldn't drink that if
I were you.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.636
Shit.

37:54.773 --> 37:55.939
Call 911.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.907
I can't .The phone is busted.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.209
Where is your cellphone?

37:59.211 --> 38:00.310
It's in my purse. Where's yours?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.845
Then get it, Emily.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.452
Wait. Who is that?

38:10.756 --> 38:16.426
Hi, Petal Pushers, welcome... hi, Bryce.
You know, can I call you back. Bye.

38:17.229 --> 38:19.195
Oh my God.
That was subtle, Emily.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.331
Hello?

38:21.900 --> 38:22.966
Hello?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.941
Should I call him back and tell
him what happened?

38:32.110 --> 38:34.678
No! We need to think.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.347
Oh God. We killed him, Ceil.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.949
We did not kill him. He
technically killed himself.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.818
But we watched. We watched.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.553
Why didn't have time to get to
him, right?

38:43.722 --> 38:46.122
Oh, there was time. There was
time.

38:46.124 --> 38:50.393
Will you stop. We need a plan...
Okay. Let me think.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.831
I've have an idea.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.035
Okay. Help me move the body.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.237
Oh no. You can't be serious.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.605
Come on, help me move the body.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.574
I'm not touching him.
Is he dead?

39:04.576 --> 39:05.508
Emily!

39:09.181 --> 39:11.548
It's quite the invention,
isn't it?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.350
Huh.

39:13.785 --> 39:14.684
Ugg.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.053
You alright? It looks like
you've seen a ghost.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.423
It's nothing. What's up?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.192
We got that tape.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.195
Okay, I'll be there in a second.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.351
I'm going to barf any minute.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.153
Well if you do you can do it in
the sink,

39:50.155 --> 39:52.355
I've had just about enough gross
for one day.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.696
What is he doing here?

39:59.698 --> 40:02.632
Oh God. What do we do? Don't
leave me.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.504
Hi.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.339
Is everything okay? We just
heard some loud noises.

40:09.341 --> 40:12.342
Oh, everything is fine. We just
dropped a big vase,

40:12.344 --> 40:14.544
made a huge mess.
Spilled some pesticides.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.080
I can send my wife over to help
you clean up,

40:17.082 --> 40:20.583
Oh, that is so nice but really
everything's fine.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.385
Well okay, then.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.989
I'm sorry. We won't do it again
but I love your food. Bye.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.995
Maybe he should have
come in and helped us.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.229
Are you nuts?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.665
Yes. And apparently so are you.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.700
I don't care. I'm just glad this
douche bag is dead.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.668
Really?

40:38.670 --> 40:39.969
Yeah, he was terrible.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.438
So you believe me now?

40:41.573 --> 40:44.507
Yeah, I guess. What comes around
goes around, right?

40:44.509 --> 40:48.011
I've never heard of karma being
used as defense in a case before.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.214
We have to call the police and
tell them it was some accident.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.582
It was sort of an accident.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.517
It was sort of self defense.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.519
It was an accident, Celia.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.323
I feel like I'm in first grade.
Can you please not call me Celia.

41:01.626 --> 41:05.328
The cops are going to want to know why we
didn't stop him from drinking the stuff.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.163
Why didn't we?

41:07.299 --> 41:08.731
I was too scared.

41:08.733 --> 41:10.066
So it self defense.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.302
I mean it's definitely not
murder one.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.536
What's after murder one?

41:13.705 --> 41:17.540
Will you stop?
We didn't kill him.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.709
It's just as well you became
friends with our local cop.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.946
He's not my friend. Shit, I need
to call him back.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.949
You know what? Maybe that'll help.
Guys will do anything to get laid.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.918
If you sleep with him, maybe he
won't turn you in.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.987
You're disgusting.
I'm not a slut.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.791
Yeah, I have to get rid of Justin, too.
I just have to figure out how.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.828
Meanwhile we will keep him here until
we figure out a new spot for him.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.332
How long do you think he'll keep
in there?

41:42.501 --> 41:44.200
Till we decide what to do.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.470
We just tell our customers he's
part of an arrangement.

41:57.849 --> 42:01.317
<i>Hi. This is detective Bryce Fry.
I'm not in the station right now.</i>

42:01.453 --> 42:03.887
<i>If this is an emergency, please</i>
<i>call 911</i>

42:04.022 --> 42:06.756
<i>or leave a message at the sound</i>
<i>of the tone. Thank you.</i>

42:07.759 --> 42:11.094
Hey. detective Fry this is Emily
Scott.

42:11.263 --> 42:13.363
So sorry I didn't get back to
you yesterday.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.865
I got hammered with a last
minute job,

42:16.001 --> 42:19.269
but I am looking forward to
talking with you tomorrow.

42:19.538 --> 42:21.337
Thank you so much
for all your help.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.520
We open in an hour and a half.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.522
I know.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.192
I am totally and completely
numb.

42:43.495 --> 42:45.361
I think we need to move him.

42:45.564 --> 42:46.563
Where?

42:46.965 --> 42:49.766
In here. Until we figure
something else out.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.368
Can't we just leave it in the
refrigerator?

42:52.370 --> 42:55.238
Gosh Emily, I'm pretty sure that
would take away from the orchids.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.608
Look, why don't we just call
the police and get it over with.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.778
No. I tried that.
They won't believe us.

43:03.315 --> 43:04.781
We're going to be on death row.

43:05.150 --> 43:08.484
Yeah, it's okay. It takes years
these days. We can appeal.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.555
why don't we just call him and
tell him it was an accident,

43:12.557 --> 43:14.223
okay, we panicked, we didn't
know what to do.

43:14.225 --> 43:18.161
It was an accident. There's got
to be another way.

43:19.831 --> 43:22.632
We could always bury the body and
pretend like it never happened.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.368
You can't be serious?

43:25.370 --> 43:28.438
Come on, Em. Is a guy like Peter
really going to be missed?

43:29.174 --> 43:30.773
Of course, you nut case.

43:38.216 --> 43:40.516
Okay, breathe girl, breathe.

43:40.685 --> 43:42.752
If you need a paper bag, there
are some under the counter.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.687
I can't look at him any more.

43:44.923 --> 43:47.156
I think he actually l
looks better dead.

43:47.359 --> 43:48.691
At least there is no smell yet.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.327
Oh, I forgot about the smell.

43:53.865 --> 43:54.764
Uggg...

43:54.766 --> 43:57.233
To think I almost went to
nursing school.

43:57.235 --> 43:58.601
There's still time.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.136
Funny.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.473
Jeez. God.

44:03.708 --> 44:06.976
My God, he is so thin.
Why is he so heavy?

44:07.245 --> 44:08.811
Think we're going to need a
bigger carpet.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.513
Oh, now you decide to be funny.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.630
How are we going to get him up
the stairs?

44:27.799 --> 44:30.233
I don't know. A little chutzpah.

44:30.602 --> 44:33.770
Can't we just put him in the van
and move him somewhere?

44:33.772 --> 44:37.340
I mean, we're going to have to take him
down the stairs in a few hours anyway.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.843
Where are we going to go, Emily. The park?
Is it bury your dead day?

44:41.146 --> 44:43.579
Besides he is going to come down
the stairs a lot faster.

44:43.581 --> 44:44.881
I just want this over with.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.817
Yeah. So do I. But I think we
need the cover of darkness.

44:47.819 --> 44:51.020
So, come on. Up we go.
Grab a leg.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.183
Are you sure we can trust him?

45:20.185 --> 45:22.452
Of course we can. Remember how
he met daddy?

45:22.787 --> 45:24.287
Yeah, that's what worries me.

45:24.289 --> 45:26.022
Secrecy was part of his job, Em.

45:26.157 --> 45:27.724
Part of his job.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.125
Not sure we want to know the
other part.

45:30.729 --> 45:33.796
Right. Why should I be worried.
Of course we can trust him.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.799
I wonder how dad would have
dealt with this?

45:36.801 --> 45:40.436
Probably would've done the same thing,
but it wouldn't have been an accident.

45:44.743 --> 45:48.377
You think you should be going that fast.
We have a dead body in back.

45:58.356 --> 46:00.022
I'm going to die
from all this work.

46:00.024 --> 46:02.625
Keep digging.
This isn't deep enough.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.927
Cadaver dogs could still pick up
the scent.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.062
Hey, where's Suzanne?

46:06.064 --> 46:09.532
She's out like a light. A little
special tea did the trick.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.100
Oh yeah. We should
bury her next.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.101
Ceil!

46:12.103 --> 46:14.137
I'm kidding. Let's go. It's
getting late.

46:22.747 --> 46:24.080
It's not deep enough.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.481
I told you so.

46:33.691 --> 46:36.092
They have a great chili omelet.

46:36.227 --> 46:40.630
I'll pass. You know, chili just
doesn't scream breakfast food to me.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.799
There's an egg in here.

46:44.035 --> 46:47.003
What was so important you
couldn't just text me.

46:52.544 --> 46:54.277
What is it?

46:54.278 --> 46:56.011
Isn't this the guy that you
were looking at for that babe?

46:56.714 --> 46:59.816
Her name is Emily. But yeah, it
is. When did this come in?

46:59.818 --> 47:01.450
This morning.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.854
Do we know who
Suzanne Hammer is?

47:05.223 --> 47:08.491
Apparently she is his
girlfriend.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.726
The boys said she went ballistic
when they told her

47:10.728 --> 47:12.295
that we couldn't do anything
right away,

47:12.664 --> 47:15.698
so they took her report just to
get rid of her.

47:16.301 --> 47:17.333
They took a report?

47:17.635 --> 47:22.205
Yeah. I'd say we can
open a case now.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.140
Maybe. Um.

47:25.243 --> 47:28.044
Hey, could you do me a favor and
cover me at the station for an hour?

47:28.780 --> 47:30.680
Don't press your luck with the
captain, Bryce.

47:30.682 --> 47:33.749
I won't. I've just got a hunch
I've got to check out.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.152
I'll be back soon, alright?

47:36.421 --> 47:39.155
Sure think. Can't wait.

47:42.093 --> 47:46.362
I know baby, I'm so sorry but we
are up to our ears in orders.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.632
I promise I will make it up to
you next week, though.

47:49.634 --> 47:52.735
Okay. I love you, too.
Bye Bunny.

47:54.172 --> 47:56.172
How long do you think
you can keep him away?

47:56.174 --> 47:58.574
Well, he just started a new
project, so that should help.

48:00.144 --> 48:03.746
Ugg, I'm screwing up everything. I can't
find a receipt for a funeral order.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.884
Okay, okay look. Why don't we
close the shop for another day

48:07.886 --> 48:09.452
and that will give us
some extra time to think?

48:09.988 --> 48:12.855
Yeah. Another day
ought to do it.

48:22.567 --> 48:25.735
Oh sorry. We're actually closed.
Inventory.

48:25.870 --> 48:28.738
I see. Um, Is Emily around?

48:29.874 --> 48:30.806
Oh my god.

48:30.808 --> 48:31.540
Hey.

48:31.542 --> 48:32.375
Hi.

48:33.845 --> 48:34.944
Oh, let me help you with that.

48:35.079 --> 48:38.748
Oh. Don't worry about it.
Got it.

48:41.019 --> 48:43.085
All better.

48:47.058 --> 48:51.894
Where are my manners? Bryce this
is Ceil. It's short for Celia.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.230
She's my sister and
my business partner.

48:54.666 --> 48:55.998
Detective Bryce Fry.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.568
What can we help you with?

49:00.872 --> 49:04.140
Um, I think I have some
interesting information for you.

49:04.909 --> 49:09.111
I left you a few messages but
you didn't call me back.

49:09.614 --> 49:12.415
You know, we had a big big
wedding order

49:12.417 --> 49:17.420
and I've just been running around. So
I was actually about to call you... ah

49:17.555 --> 49:20.356
You know what? What exactly do you
mean when you say you have some

49:20.358 --> 49:22.925
interesting information for us?

49:23.361 --> 49:26.963
Peter Mahoney, is now officially
a missing person.

49:29.434 --> 49:35.805
Oh wow. Yeah, that sure is him.
Where did you get that picture from?

49:36.274 --> 49:38.341
From his girlfriend.

49:38.710 --> 49:40.209
Girlfriend. Right.

49:45.984 --> 49:48.851
Well missing. Hey.

49:49.087 --> 49:54.390
Yes, missing. Ah, when was the last
time either of you two saw him.

49:54.726 --> 49:58.461
Oh gosh. That... a while ago.

49:59.163 --> 50:03.366
At the park. Remember we talked
about that. The park.

50:04.502 --> 50:07.169
Right. The park.

50:14.912 --> 50:20.082
Well, I see you two are busy, so I'll
let you get to it. I'll check back later?

50:20.418 --> 50:22.418
Great! Hope you find him.

50:22.820 --> 50:23.686
Nice to meet you, Ceil.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.022
Oh, you too, detective.

50:35.333 --> 50:37.099
Really good job, Emily.

50:37.101 --> 50:38.100
What did I do?

50:42.840 --> 50:44.340
Well, now he's suspicious...

50:44.342 --> 50:48.444
You know, actually, um,
my aunt is in the hospital.

50:48.446 --> 50:52.748
I probably should take a look at
some flowers. Can I take a peak?

50:53.051 --> 50:54.450
Sure. Go right ahead.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.585
I love your store, bye the way.

50:56.721 --> 50:58.120
Thank you.

50:59.190 --> 51:02.058
Wow. You guys are classy.
These don't come cheap.

51:02.060 --> 51:05.061
You know, why don't you just go ahead
and grab a bouquet. It's on the house.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.036
Isn't this your, mother's, card?

51:14.038 --> 51:17.907
Oh my God. Yes. How do you
suppose that got in there, Ceil?

51:18.876 --> 51:20.643
I don't know.
That is really weird.

51:20.645 --> 51:24.613
You know, we haven't cleaned that
out in quite a while. So, no telling.

51:25.850 --> 51:28.484
Well, I would just make sure
that account is closed.

51:28.486 --> 51:31.153
Yeah. Let's do that right away.

51:31.155 --> 51:34.156
Thanks for the offer but it's
against the rules, so...

51:35.827 --> 51:38.260
She likes candy anyway.
Ha ha ha.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.096
Have a great day. Thank you.

51:40.098 --> 51:42.264
Bye, detective.

51:47.238 --> 51:50.906
So that is your cop?
He's kind of cute.

51:51.075 --> 51:53.342
He's not my cop.

51:53.343 --> 51:55.610
Yeah, but aren't you glad you went
to the police. You know? For help.

51:55.913 --> 51:58.414
Shut up. Don't blame me.

51:58.416 --> 52:00.583
I'm not the one that offered
free flowers.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.118
Now what are we going to do?

52:02.120 --> 52:05.254
Well, we have to
move the body, again.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.790
Oh my God. I wish I were dead.

52:21.739 --> 52:22.605
You want a bite.

52:23.774 --> 52:25.207
I'll pass.

52:26.744 --> 52:28.110
How did it go?

52:28.446 --> 52:29.478
Strange.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.515
You tell them about
baloney, Mahoney.

52:32.650 --> 52:33.916
Yes. I did tell them.

52:33.918 --> 52:34.817
And?

52:35.153 --> 52:37.486
Something seems out of kilter.

52:38.289 --> 52:39.788
What's that mean; out of kilter?

52:40.958 --> 52:44.393
I'm not sure, what it means.
What about the car?

52:45.229 --> 52:46.996
Missing as well.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.366
I don't know. Maybe it's a
female thing.

52:50.601 --> 52:55.304
Women, right. Got to love em;
second only to their vaginas.

52:55.973 --> 52:56.939
You want my opinion?

52:56.941 --> 52:58.457
No.

52:58.458 --> 52:59.974
We don't even have a case yet. Why
don't you let somebody else handle it.

52:59.977 --> 53:01.177
Save your neck.

53:02.480 --> 53:06.649
This woman has had a strange
effect on you, Bryce.

53:07.084 --> 53:10.853
I mean we have other cases. What
about that guy with the Koala Bear?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.190
That was strange.

53:17.295 --> 53:20.095
If you want my opinion,
just ask for it.

53:41.619 --> 53:43.352
Oh, Jesus!

53:46.557 --> 53:47.623
What!

53:50.695 --> 53:51.594
Let me in.

53:51.729 --> 53:52.394
What?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.880
- Where is he?
- Who?

53:54.881 --> 53:57.365
You know who. Peter. He has been
missing for almost three days.

53:57.501 --> 53:58.667
Looks like you got dumped.

53:58.669 --> 54:00.069
Ceil. Let her in.

54:01.639 --> 54:02.905
Thank you.

54:03.174 --> 54:04.440
What's the matter?

54:06.244 --> 54:11.280
Charles hasn't seen him. I haven't seen
him, but I think you two know something.

54:11.716 --> 54:14.316
I guess he skipped town, gonna
set up something new

54:14.318 --> 54:16.619
with someone who is
not mentally challenged.

54:19.690 --> 54:24.326
You bitch! He wouldn't
do that to me.

54:24.328 --> 54:27.096
Yes he would. We killed our
mother for all her money,

54:27.365 --> 54:29.231
so dumping you
would mean nothing.

54:30.835 --> 54:33.269
Well then why is his
car parked down the street?

54:36.841 --> 54:38.841
You're mistaken.
He hasn't been here.

54:39.844 --> 54:42.177
Well, we'll just see what the
police have to say about this.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.480
What do you two
think about that?

54:46.550 --> 54:48.651
It's locked, dumb ass.

54:50.254 --> 54:51.453
Shit.

54:51.455 --> 54:52.554
The car?

54:52.556 --> 54:53.555
Well, what are we going to do?

55:11.042 --> 55:12.541
This is just too weird.

55:14.412 --> 55:17.846
I can't help but think mom is up there
finishing up up some sort of business.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.215
Even I don't think that, Ceil.

55:20.951 --> 55:22.851
I need a break from reality.

55:22.987 --> 55:24.987
Hopefully we're in the
middle of one.

55:33.230 --> 55:35.130
Are you sure there's
another set of keys?

55:36.634 --> 55:37.483
Yes, I'm sure.

55:37.484 --> 55:38.333
So, where are we
going to even put it?

55:38.336 --> 55:42.237
I don't know, Emily. It's a black Mercedes
Benz. We'll park it in Beverly Hills.

55:42.239 --> 55:43.739
No one will notice.

55:43.741 --> 55:48.310
Oh, come on, like we need to be stopped
for texting while driving, right now.

55:48.312 --> 55:52.681
I'm just trying to tell Justin I'm sorry
for standing him up again. Here you text.

55:53.184 --> 55:54.683
Hi Bunny.

55:56.854 --> 56:02.157
Sorry, I'm not going to make it.
I'm stuck at work. Lots of flowers.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.326
God, we are so dead.

56:08.165 --> 56:09.698
Sent.

56:47.972 --> 56:50.606
Are you having a party in here?
I thought we were a meeting.

56:51.041 --> 56:54.643
The prick is dead and buried.
And I'm happy as a clam.

56:54.645 --> 56:56.211
Well Susanne's dead, too.

56:56.213 --> 56:57.713
What?

56:57.714 --> 56:59.214
Yeah, she got hit
by a car. It's a big mess.

56:59.216 --> 57:00.482
Did you run over?

57:00.684 --> 57:01.917
- Of course not.
- No.

57:02.086 --> 57:05.621
Then don't don't worry about it.
She was walking bad karma.

57:06.490 --> 57:09.057
Okay look. We have to move Peter.
The cops are going to come digging.

57:09.059 --> 57:10.192
He's not safe out there.

57:10.194 --> 57:11.693
And there is a
matter of some keys.

57:11.695 --> 57:14.296
Peter's car is still parked in
front of the shop.

57:14.832 --> 57:17.032
Are you sure we
need to move him?

57:17.034 --> 57:18.033
Yes

57:18.035 --> 57:19.268
Let's go.

57:27.244 --> 57:33.982
What is it, Hennesy.
Yes, I know. What?

57:35.019 --> 57:38.654
Okay. Hold the fort. I can be
there in ten minutes. All right.

57:47.598 --> 57:48.864
This her?

57:49.099 --> 57:52.434
Yes it is. What the hell?

57:53.304 --> 57:55.971
This happened in
front of their flower shop.

57:58.309 --> 58:01.176
I think it's time I
had a chat with her.

58:02.279 --> 58:03.879
You, you think?

58:17.127 --> 58:18.660
You're sure it's safe?

58:18.662 --> 58:21.730
Yeah. Eric and I used to come during
high school. No ones out there.

58:22.766 --> 58:24.833
You mean Derek?

58:24.834 --> 58:26.901
Eric, Derek, whatever. It's the
same thing.

58:26.904 --> 58:29.771
Well, how do you know they haven't
built like houses on it or something?

58:29.773 --> 58:31.773
I don't but it's not like it's
Lake Tahoe.

58:31.775 --> 58:35.544
I can't imagine a sign that says
The Estates at Last Virgin Lake.

58:37.181 --> 58:41.250
I forgot that. Las Virginis.
What was the catch phrase again?

58:41.619 --> 58:45.187
Arrive whole. Leave a hoe.

58:47.124 --> 58:48.190
You okay, Charles?

58:48.425 --> 58:49.324
Oh yeah.

58:50.261 --> 58:51.560
Right as rain.

59:02.773 --> 59:07.242
Careful... Careful with him.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.821
Should we say a few words or
something?

59:19.823 --> 59:21.790
Yeah. How about goodbye. Let's
get out of here.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.743
I need to talk to you.

59:42.079 --> 59:43.078
What?

59:43.080 --> 59:45.080
I need to talk to you.

59:45.382 --> 59:46.949
About what?

59:47.084 --> 59:48.317
Go to the door.

59:55.859 --> 59:57.726
Wait. Emily what are you doing?

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:07.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't just
barge in here. Do you have a warrant?

01:00:07.538 --> 01:00:10.405
Warrant? I just want to talk to Emily.
I actually want to talk to you, too.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.307
I'm not talking to you.
Don't talk to him.

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.076
It's okay, Ceil.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.912
Emily. We're family. He's not.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.313
We have to tell him.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.182
Not without a lawyer present.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.050
You need a lawyer?

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:24.586
I have to tell him.
He's all we have.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.488
Don't worry, Ceil.
It's going to be okay.

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:30.258
Fine. It's just our funeral.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.430
Can we sit down
and talk and sec.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:36.498
Sure.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.944
I'm sure you know by now that
Mr. Mahoney has a dead girlfriend?

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:53.949
Yeah. It's awful. It happened
really close to here, right?

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:57.319
Emily, It happened right in
front of the shop right here.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:01.123
I think you can be a little more
forthcoming with me.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.058
Right outside the shop?

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:09.731
My God. My whole life is falling
apart.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:11.633
I'm going to fry in
the electric chair.

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.503
We don't use the
electric chair anymore.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.004
Oh?

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:21.910
She was very angry. She came into
the shop and she made a scene,

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:23.478
and then she left in a huff.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.715
She didn't even see the car.
It was horrible.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:29.818
Are you going to take us in?

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.587
Did you run or over?

01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:34.322
No of course not.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.525
Your the second
person to ask that.

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:40.696
Why didn't you call the police?

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:47.569
I don't know. I guess we were just in
shock and I saw other people calling them.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:55.510
Do you want me to tell you what
I found out about Mr. Mahoney?

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.946
Of course.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:01.349
Okay. So I told you before he
was married back in New Jersey.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:05.554
Well, he was married before that. Both
women died the same way your mom did.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:11.226
And they both had lots of cash. So,
I really need to find out where he is.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:18.233
Well, that might be a little
hard to do.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.036
And why is that?

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:27.642
Well, he's a little bit
indisposed, currently.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.111
Indisposed.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:40.756
Ah, by any chance does that mean that
at an earlier time he was expired

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:44.226
and potentially in that
refrigerator over there?

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:53.802
The card that we found, it was your
mom's account but it was his card, huh?

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:59.441
It really was an accident. It's not
going to sound like it was but it was.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:04.079
He came in here he was
threatening us the whole time.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.515
He knew what I was asking
questions about his past.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.251
And then there was this glass.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.522
What glass?

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:16.424
It's hard to explain. You know
he grabbed me and I kicked him,

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:18.326
and then he grabbed Ceil.

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:22.798
and Ceil had poured this pure
nicotine into a glass.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.333
It was eating through
a paper cup.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:29.137
He thought there was
booze in the glass.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:33.942
So what. He drank the nicotine?

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.978
Yeah. Now you're
getting the idea.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.482
Wow.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.888
Did he have a weapon
on him or anything?

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:52.294
No. Well he didn't
when we buried him.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.564
What?

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.133
Ahh...

01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:03.805
Emily, why didn't you call me?
Why did you call the police?

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.141
I don't know. I honestly don't.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:09.077
I mean when he fell over he
ripped the phone out of the wall,

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:12.047
and Ceils cell phone was
in the apartment.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:16.318
Then you called and I just
thought I would sound nuts.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.357
So I really did kill
somebody, didn't I?

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:28.830
Um, did you have a gun to his
head when he drank the nicotine?

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.833
No. Of course not.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:40.075
Then technically you didn't kill anybody.
Ah, you just kind of... helped.

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:49.451
Ah, it's probably manslaughter. But um,
what I think the prudent thing to do,

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:54.689
at this juncture, would be for
you to take me to the body,

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.058
and then we'll go from there.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:07.102
Right. Well, that too,
will be a challenge.

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.939
I probably shouldn't
even ask, should I?

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:30.125
All right, I'll admit it.
I'm intrigued.

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:33.929
You've never asked me to meet in
such a clandestine way before.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.899
Well, you yourself said that we
have not opened the case, yet.

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:40.936
Okay. Now I know
what this is about.

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.003
I need a big favor.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.240
It's not going to land me in
prison, will it?

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.508
It might.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.144
No, no. I was joking
when I said that.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.413
I was being a little dramatic.

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.982
No, you're never dramatic.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.185
What's the favor?

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.623
You wouldn't happen to own a
snorkel, would ya?

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.965
Are you sure this is a spot?

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.867
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.971
How did you weigh the body down?

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.608
Huh... Alright.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.293
Detective?

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.829
Yeah.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.530
I think these are really going
to help your case.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.335
Thanks, Ceil.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.236
Sure.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.705
Hey guys?

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:51.973
Yeah.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:54.809
What is it?

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:11.993
Oops.

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:18.266
Oh, if it isn't detective Fry,
back from the dead.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.167
Huh?

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:22.771
Ah, we know we were
early this morning.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.206
You do?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.542
You shouldn't have.

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:30.678
Shouldn't have what?

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.448
Come on.

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:35.784
I. but I...

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:36.484
Look, look at this.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.937
I just...

01:07:38.938 --> 01:07:41.389
Look at this. I mean, detective
Fry, you are the best.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.726
No one else remembered that it's
my 10th anniversary. But you did.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:50.398
And chocolate cake. That's my
favorite. How'd you know?

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.535
Ahhh, I'm a detective?

01:07:57.174 --> 01:07:59.274
Nice of you to show up.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:04.412
All right, Hennessy, let's
agree, I definitely owe you one.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.982
No. It's all in a day's work.
But you do owe me.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.219
How did it feel
doing a day's work?

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:15.623
It was weird. It was like, I
don't do nice things for people.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.073
Ow!

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.626
You okay?

01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:36.077
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Don't worry.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:39.814
Sorry. I just want you to have
everything you need. Okay?

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.015
I'm really excited
about being an aunt.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.520
You're going to be an aunt in
prison and my daughter...

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:49.189
Hey, lots of famous people were born
in prison. Don't worry about it.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.658
At least you'll have a guy
waiting for you when you get out.

01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:55.363
We'll see. Hennessy and Bryce
are still walking the beat.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:56.930
Bryce isn't too happy about it.

01:08:56.933 --> 01:09:00.435
Yeah, but there's no chance in hell he's
not going to be here when you get out.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.937
He really threw himself under
the bus for you,

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:05.140
for the both of us, as a matter
of fact.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.207
I'm sure Justin's
gonna be there, too.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.042
I'm not too sure about that.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:13.046
But you know what, there are a lot of
really hot babes walking around here.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.349
Ha, ha.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:17.385
We got another letter from
Charles.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:20.354
Really. What did he say? Did he
tell you where he was?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.622
No, of course not.

01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:27.095
I sure hope he wasn't serious when he
said he was looking for Tim Robbins

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.529
and Morgan Freeman.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.799
I just hope he's happy.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.703
What do you think about that
sleazy producer's offer?

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.604
I guess if they make it into a
good movie

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.875
and not one of those after school
specials, I'm okay. What about you?

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.810
I just want a say in casting.

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.647
That's not going to happen.

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:47.814
Then they can kiss my ass.
