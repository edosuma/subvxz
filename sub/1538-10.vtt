00:19.954 --> 00:23.956
Elsa:
<i>The death of a beloved monster</i>
<i>is always a sorrow,</i>

00:23.958 --> 00:27.026
<i>But never a surprise.</i>

00:28.963 --> 00:30.963
<i>If oddly-formed organs</i>

00:30.965 --> 00:35.968
<i>Or a random physical anomaly</i>
<i>doesn't claim them,</i>

00:35.970 --> 00:39.038
<i>Then it's the sheer intensity</i>
<i>of their blaze.</i>

00:40.975 --> 00:44.977
<i>A carny's life burns larger</i>
<i>and brighter than most.</i>

00:44.979 --> 00:46.979
<i>It is bound</i>
<i>to extinguish sooner.</i>

00:46.981 --> 00:48.981
Paul:
Pepper.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.050
Pepper, it's time.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.053
It isn't salty anymore.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.991
It's just a body.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.093
A shell.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.529
Elsa:
<i>No long-lingering embers.</i>

01:03.531 --> 01:06.331
<i>A life lived</i>
<i>to its fullest and then--</i>

01:06.333 --> 01:08.333
<i>Phfft--</i>

01:08.335 --> 01:09.735
Nahrung fur wurmer.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.103
<i>Worm food.</i>

01:11.105 --> 01:13.739
Of course she
understands death.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.741
Why am i the only
one in the camp

01:15.743 --> 01:18.043
Who knows the depth of
that girl's soul, huh?

01:18.045 --> 01:20.879
Still, salty's body is about
to give off a smell,

01:20.881 --> 01:22.948
And she won't budge
from that bed.

01:28.022 --> 01:31.290
Elsa:
<i>Most pinheads die</i>
<i>before the age of 40.</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:34.927
No...

01:37.565 --> 01:39.865
(screaming)

01:39.867 --> 01:44.403
(sobbing)

01:44.405 --> 01:47.873
Elsa:
<i>Salty died in his sleep,</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:49.942
<i>Right next to his soul mate.</i>

01:51.879 --> 01:54.947
<i>A stroke, one presumes.</i>

01:57.885 --> 01:59.952
<i>We should all go that way.</i>

02:02.890 --> 02:04.890
<i>And my sweet pepper,</i>

02:04.892 --> 02:09.495
<i>She never mistreated him</i>

02:09.497 --> 02:12.331
<i>Or took advantage</i>
<i>of his moronic nature.</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:15.100
Ugh, he was so stupid.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.069
<i>Und</i> i worked so hard with him.

02:17.071 --> 02:20.072
Flash cards, and...

02:20.074 --> 02:22.074
Brain teasers.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.642
All to no avail.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.979
Not like pepper.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.448
She could communicate.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.451
He was a grunter.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.453
Crude and moronic.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.455
(chuckles)

02:36.457 --> 02:40.526
But she was absolutely
devoted to him.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.330
What is that look?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.965
Hmm?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.268
I want you to take
a good look at your face.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.602
Tell me what you see.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.803
Cold cream.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.805
No, that's the face
of suffering.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.641
That's the face
of a woman overwhelmed

02:55.643 --> 02:57.442
With too much worry
and responsibility.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.344
All i have
left is worry.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.847
You know what,
richard?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.849
I want you
out of here.
Ah.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.918
Out of this camp.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.788
Elsa, dearest lady.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.359
What's this?

03:14.361 --> 03:16.028
This is the telegram
we've been waiting for.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.963
This came
this morning.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.866
The head of the network wants
to meet with us in three weeks.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.135
What does he want me to do?

03:23.137 --> 03:27.139
All he wants you
to do is to rest.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.541
You know, get
your beauty rest.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.877
Huh.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.512
Look, i have a
source who tells me

03:33.514 --> 03:35.981
That a slot is
opening up soon--

03:35.983 --> 03:37.149
Friday night, 8:00.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.817
After perry como?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.185
Elsa.
No, i mean...

03:40.187 --> 03:41.653
You have to understand,
you-you've...

03:41.655 --> 03:43.021
No, no. Yes,
i know, i know.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.223
It's just that
i've waited so long.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.857
I don't know
what to say.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.859
Which is precisely
why you have to listen to me

03:47.861 --> 03:49.861
When i tell you
that all this tragedy

03:49.863 --> 03:52.664
That you've experienced has,
frankly, taken its toll on you.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.667
You need to rest.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.502
But my pepper.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.571
No, she needs me now.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.711
Which is why you need me

04:05.713 --> 04:08.046
To take care of her.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.115
Just as i have so rigorously
taken care of you.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.685
We will have a
splendid cremation.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.688
And i will present dear pepper
with his ashes in an urn

04:16.690 --> 04:18.523
Inlaid with-with
mother-of-pearl.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.392
No. No.
And she could always
keep him close.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.392
No!

04:21.394 --> 04:23.395
No.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.398
She will want
a proper burial.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.066
Perfumed shrouds.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.068
Elsa.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.370
What?

04:31.372 --> 04:34.740
I have worked miracles
for you.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.777
I have made
your dreams come true.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.546
Let me take care
of the body.

04:41.548 --> 04:45.450
What must a man do
to earn your trust?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.080
¶ ¶

06:30.657 --> 06:35.394
"'wasn't i real before?'
asked the little rabbit.

06:35.396 --> 06:39.064
"'you were real to the boy,'
the fairy said,

06:39.066 --> 06:42.834
"'because he loved you.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.905
"now you shall be real
to everyone.'

06:48.842 --> 06:53.412
"and she held the little rabbit
close in her arms

06:53.414 --> 06:56.415
And flew with him
to the wood."

06:56.417 --> 06:58.116
That's beautiful, dessi.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.654
You're gonna make
a great mom someday.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.324
Can i talk to you
for a second?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.830
Shh...

07:16.937 --> 07:19.004
I've made mistakes.

07:20.407 --> 07:22.407
I haven't been
the best husband to you,

07:22.409 --> 07:24.209
But i want
another chance.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.610
You saved
my life, dessi.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.612
And you saved mine.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.548
You don't owe
me anything.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.782
But we've put
too many years

07:30.784 --> 07:32.250
Into this thing
to just quit now.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.320
We both deserve a shot
at happiness, dell.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.957
And i could never
make you happy.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.894
Truly happy.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.262
(pepper groans)

07:44.264 --> 07:45.730
Now go on now.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.732
You're making
her upset.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.734
(groaning intensifies)

07:49.736 --> 07:51.736
All right, pepper.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.738
All right, i
got to go.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.940
No, no. I can't
now, pepper.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.408
Okay, look.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.144
I've got to go put
my face on for the show.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.013
But we can finish reading
after curtain.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.248
Stay...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.449
I can't, baby.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.518
The show must go on.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.590
Stay! Stay! Stay!

08:11.592 --> 08:13.525
Stay!

08:14.428 --> 08:17.329
(screams)
stay...!

08:17.331 --> 08:19.798
(sobs)

08:19.800 --> 08:21.466
You finished?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.102
Hmm?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.704
Good.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.674
Now you clean
all this shit up.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.982
Mm.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.952
How is our little pinhead?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.453
She won't eat.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.256
And she just turned
her tent upside down.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.360
Yes. Poor girl.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.532
It was an old emptiness
salty filled for her.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.534
Schnapps?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.002
Sure.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.004
Sit down.

08:59.006 --> 09:03.642
And her fit came
when you tried to leave, no?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.377
(laughs gently)
how did you know?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.379
Well...

09:07.381 --> 09:10.382
We all fear that we will
end up alone,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.484
That love will
be pulled from us.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.489
But it is even
stronger for pepper.

09:17.491 --> 09:21.393
She has known nothing but
abandonment her entire life.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.696
Until i found her, of course.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.897
<i>Prost!</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:28.767
Gesundheit.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.740
Well, what will we do
when you leave for hollywood?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.042
Hmm?
(chuckles)

09:37.044 --> 09:40.045
I mean, ma petite,
salty, then you?

09:40.047 --> 09:42.213
That girl may throw herself
from the top

09:42.215 --> 09:43.582
Of the ferris wheel
from grief.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.050
Well, we can't
let that happen.

09:45.052 --> 09:49.154
We'll have to find a way
to rouse her spirits.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.929
You know, i came to
this country in 1936.

10:00.867 --> 10:04.869
Hitler had already made it
plenty unpleasant

10:04.871 --> 10:06.871
For artists in berlin.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.075
<i>There was little work</i>
<i>for an émigré.</i>

10:10.077 --> 10:12.210
<i>There was little work</i>
<i>for anyone, really,</i>

10:12.212 --> 10:14.613
<i>Unless you wanted</i>
<i>to build a dam or highway.</i>

10:14.615 --> 10:17.082
<i>So i found myself</i>
<i>with the gypsies,</i>

10:17.084 --> 10:19.718
<i>The carny folk, in boston.</i>

10:19.720 --> 10:23.388
<i>My english wasn't good enough</i>
<i>to headline, yet,</i>

10:23.390 --> 10:25.757
<i>So i suffered through</i>
<i>being a chorus girl</i>

10:25.759 --> 10:28.126
<i>Behind lesser talents.</i>
(woman cries out)

10:28.128 --> 10:31.763
<i>Still, i made my way to the top</i>
<i>of the heap quickly.</i>

10:31.765 --> 10:34.966
(panicked shouting)

10:34.968 --> 10:38.069
<i>They called me</i>
<i>the teutonic chanteuse.</i>

10:38.071 --> 10:40.639
<i>But i don't like working</i>
<i>for other people.</i>

10:40.641 --> 10:42.641
<i>I need to be in charge.</i>

10:42.643 --> 10:44.976
<i>To have my own show.</i>

10:50.283 --> 10:52.584
(groans)
<i>the circus owners were morons.</i>

10:52.586 --> 10:54.252
Ring leader:
I don't want any freaks.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.255
<i>They could not see the future.</i>

10:57.257 --> 10:59.624
<i>I knew there was a war coming.</i>

10:59.626 --> 11:03.695
<i>The boys would be sent off to</i>
<i>fight, the women put to work,</i>

11:03.697 --> 11:05.764
<i>And who would be left</i>
<i>to get on stage</i>

11:05.766 --> 11:08.767
<i>And make them laugh or cry</i>
<i>or forget their worries?</i>

11:08.769 --> 11:10.602
<i>The freaks.</i>

11:10.604 --> 11:13.605
<i>So i decided to start</i>
<i>my own collection of oddities.</i>

11:13.607 --> 11:15.440
<i>The idea was simple--</i>

11:15.442 --> 11:19.778
<i>They would come for the freaks,</i>
<i>but stay for the star.</i>

11:19.780 --> 11:22.447
<i>But where to find my pets?</i>

11:22.449 --> 11:25.016
<i>Most people don't see beauty</i>
<i>in someone like pepper.</i>

11:25.018 --> 11:26.618
<i>They see shame.</i>

11:26.620 --> 11:28.620
<i>They see human garbage.</i>

11:28.622 --> 11:32.023
<i>So i went to the place where</i>
<i>people throw other people away.</i>

11:32.025 --> 11:34.025
(bell tolling)

11:34.027 --> 11:36.027
<i>An orphanage.</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.863
(children shouting playfully)

11:47.040 --> 11:49.107
(door closes)

12:00.687 --> 12:02.754
¶ ¶

12:28.548 --> 12:30.915
(laughs)

12:30.917 --> 12:34.919
<i>She never knew her father.</i>

12:34.921 --> 12:37.355
<i>Her mother died.</i>

12:37.357 --> 12:41.192
<i>Her sister loved her but simply</i>
<i>could not handle the burden.</i>

12:41.194 --> 12:44.195
<i>Orphanages don't usually</i>
<i>take 18-year-olds,</i>

12:44.197 --> 12:47.265
<i>But pepper had the mind</i>
<i>of a child.</i>

12:51.538 --> 12:54.539
<i>I offered to adopt her,</i>
<i>but since she was of legal age</i>

12:54.541 --> 12:56.741
<i>They just let us</i>
<i>leave together.</i>

12:56.743 --> 12:59.210
<i>I think they were worried</i>
<i>i might change my mind.</i>

12:59.212 --> 13:00.545
<i>But how could i?</i>

13:00.547 --> 13:01.813
<i>I loved her.</i>

13:01.815 --> 13:03.782
<i>My first monster.</i>

13:03.784 --> 13:07.619
<i>Adoration, affection,</i>
<i>idolization-- i am a performer,</i>

13:07.621 --> 13:09.621
<i>I had felt them all in droves.</i>

13:09.623 --> 13:14.759
<i>But when this strange-looking</i>
<i>little one looked at me,</i>

13:14.761 --> 13:18.797
<i>It was the first time i had</i>
<i>ever felt unconditional love.</i>

13:21.735 --> 13:23.668
(birds chirping)

13:31.578 --> 13:33.645
(applause, cheering)

13:34.948 --> 13:37.448
<i>I knew,</i>
<i>after her first performance,</i>

13:37.450 --> 13:39.818
<i>That she was a keeper.</i>

13:39.820 --> 13:42.320
¶ ¶

13:45.425 --> 13:48.626
<i>My collection grew.</i>

13:48.628 --> 13:51.930
<i>I took great pride</i>
<i>in mothering my troupe.</i>

13:51.932 --> 13:54.165
<i>Most of them knew</i>
<i>nothing of the world,</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:57.769
<i>Save for how to survive in it.</i>

13:57.771 --> 14:01.472
<i>But i could tell that none</i>
<i>of my teaching or attention</i>

14:01.474 --> 14:04.342
<i>Was going to make</i>
<i>my firstborn happy.</i>

14:04.344 --> 14:05.944
<i>She was a woman now</i>

14:05.946 --> 14:07.879
<i>And she had maternal needs.</i>

14:07.881 --> 14:10.715
<i>But she couldn't possibly</i>
<i>be allowed to breed.</i>

14:10.717 --> 14:13.518
<i>Little did i know that</i>
<i>the answer to my prayers</i>

14:13.520 --> 14:16.521
<i>Would arrive a few weeks later</i>
<i>from the far east.</i>

14:20.160 --> 14:22.994
<i>Suryamohan bahadur was</i>

14:22.996 --> 14:24.996
<i>The maharaja of kapurthala.</i>

14:24.998 --> 14:27.298
<i>The maharaja was</i>
<i>touring the u.S.</i>

14:27.300 --> 14:29.467
<i>He was a slave to the british,</i>

14:29.469 --> 14:31.970
<i>But he was</i>
<i>the richest slave on earth.</i>

14:31.972 --> 14:33.338
<i>He traveled with an entourage--</i>

14:33.340 --> 14:34.806
<i>Footmen, concubines, eunuchs...</i>

14:34.808 --> 14:37.775
<i>And one tiny miracle.</i>

14:55.729 --> 14:58.229
<i>I needed her,</i>

14:58.231 --> 15:00.665
<i>But he could not be moved.</i>

15:00.667 --> 15:03.101
(speaking native language)

15:03.103 --> 15:05.436
Aide:
The maharaja says
the girl is a dalit.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.438
An untouchable.
To trade her

15:07.440 --> 15:09.374
For anything would assume
the raj has given her value.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.676
He would take it as
a personal insult.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.511
She is his
favorite pet.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.947
He would never
part with her.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.113
(insects trilling outside)

15:57.624 --> 15:59.223
Elsa:
<i>He finally caved in</i>

15:59.225 --> 16:01.426
<i>When i offered him three cases.</i>

16:01.428 --> 16:03.127
<i>Dr. Pepper.</i>

16:03.129 --> 16:05.630
<i>Sweet irony, no?</i>

16:33.159 --> 16:36.327
<i>I had never</i>
<i>seen pepper so happy.</i>

16:36.329 --> 16:38.830
(laughs)

16:42.502 --> 16:44.602
<i>Her maternal needs</i>
<i>were fulfilled.</i>

16:44.604 --> 16:46.671
<i>And yet, she wanted more.</i>

16:56.983 --> 16:59.150
<i>She needed a husband.</i>

16:59.152 --> 17:01.185
<i>A spiritual husband.</i>

17:07.993 --> 17:10.228
<i>I wrote to every orphanage</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

17:10.230 --> 17:11.963
<i>Six months later,</i>

17:11.964 --> 17:15.266
<i>A home for wayward boys</i>
<i>in cincinnati wrote back.</i>

17:19.138 --> 17:21.606
<i>It was love at first sight.</i>

17:23.710 --> 17:26.210
(joyous dance tune playing)

17:31.217 --> 17:33.718
(movie projector clicking)

17:37.690 --> 17:41.659
<i>I officiated the wedding,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

17:41.661 --> 17:44.162
<i>It was a magical affair.</i>

17:44.164 --> 17:46.330
<i>Simple... The bride and groom</i>

17:46.332 --> 17:50.068
<i>Knew six words between them,</i>

17:50.070 --> 17:54.505
<i>But it was deeply moving.</i>

17:54.507 --> 17:57.475
¶ ¶

18:15.762 --> 18:18.129
They raised ma petite
as their own child.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.100
And i was their
fairy godmother.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.042
Theirs was a love story
for the ages.

18:31.044 --> 18:33.878
They never hurt a soul,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.947
Never sinned.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.750
Pure spirits.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.587
That girl...

18:42.589 --> 18:44.789
Lost everyone she loved.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.759
You got to find out if
her sister is still around.

18:48.761 --> 18:53.097
I mean, pepper is not
the handful she used to be.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.166
She's a grown woman, now.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.803
Useful.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.144
Maybe you're right.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.912
(exhales)

19:07.914 --> 19:10.348
Perhaps it's time
for our little angel...

19:16.122 --> 19:17.355
(sighs)

19:17.357 --> 19:19.824
...To go back home.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.074
(insects trilling)

19:46.486 --> 19:48.119
(laughing)

19:48.121 --> 19:50.955
Maggie... (giggles)
you remember angus?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.190
Hello, ma'am.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.691
Nice to make
your acquaintance.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.127
We want to have...
I know exactly what you want.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.297
Welcome to mystic esmeralda's
temple of destiny.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.565
Have a seat.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.871
(gasps)

20:09.709 --> 20:12.176
Maggie:
Fine tall drink of water,
there, desiree.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.478
Where'd you round him up?
Desiree:
You remember that evening

20:14.480 --> 20:18.182
When i was showin' off
the new dance craze?

20:18.184 --> 20:21.686
¶ mamba, baby ¶

20:21.688 --> 20:23.221
(cheering, whistling)

20:23.223 --> 20:27.158
¶ tonight ¶

20:27.160 --> 20:29.493
¶ you turned darkness... ¶

20:29.495 --> 20:30.895
Angus:
<i>I knew right then and there,</i>

20:30.897 --> 20:32.663
<i>My days as a confirmed bachelor</i>

20:32.665 --> 20:34.165
Were over.
(giggles)

20:34.167 --> 20:36.834
I had to make
her mine.
Ooh...

20:36.836 --> 20:39.403
(laughs)
mmm...

20:39.405 --> 20:41.572
So...

20:41.574 --> 20:43.174
Tell us...

20:43.176 --> 20:44.742
What do you see
in our future?

20:52.018 --> 20:54.018
You're a traveler.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.187
A salesman,
roaming door-to-door.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.421
Why, yes.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.689
That's right.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.358
Jefferson's floor wax

21:00.360 --> 21:02.860
Make your home
shiny and new.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.162
(both laughing)

21:07.800 --> 21:09.934
Ooh, hush, now.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.303
Oh, let's get to
the good stuff.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.804
You're a romantic.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.072
A dreamer.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.241
I see you two lovebirds

21:17.243 --> 21:18.409
Starting a new beginning.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.212
Somewhere out west.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.747
Oh, a small house...

21:22.749 --> 21:24.048
A white picket fence...

21:24.050 --> 21:25.549
Oh, that's
right, angus.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.118
Mama needs a picket,

21:27.120 --> 21:28.619
And the picket
better be white.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.087
Oh, whatever you want,
baby, you got it.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.922
Well, how many kids
we gonna have?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.224
Ooh, kids!

21:33.226 --> 21:35.293
(laughing)

21:36.729 --> 21:39.563
Then... Everything goes to shit,

21:39.565 --> 21:41.065
Because that's what happens.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.601
You'll start to...
Despise each other.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.403
There's no joy.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.571
There's no hope.

21:47.573 --> 21:50.308
It guts you, ripping you apart,
piece by piece,

21:50.310 --> 21:51.976
Until one day, you find yourself

21:51.978 --> 21:53.978
Standing in a kitchen,
heating up tar

21:53.980 --> 21:55.246
And gripping
a pillow.

21:55.248 --> 21:57.415
Angus, i think
i've had enough

21:57.417 --> 22:00.251
Of the fairy tales
for one evening.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.652
Maggie's had
a long day.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.654
Let's you and me
go get some ice cream.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.289
I'm a god-fearing
christian.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.524
I don't believe

22:06.526 --> 22:08.359
In this sorcery
stuff, anyway.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.361
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.629
It all ends the same.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.698
Let's get
out of here.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.702
(coins clatter)

22:21.941 --> 22:24.208
(metallic creaking)

22:36.622 --> 22:37.822
Desiree:
Hey!

22:37.824 --> 22:39.623
Miss sunshine
and roses!

22:39.625 --> 22:40.825
What was that
back there?

22:40.827 --> 22:43.127
You weren't
telling my future.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.328
You were
telling your own.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.464
Your man is rotting in a cell

22:46.466 --> 22:47.665
And here you are,

22:47.667 --> 22:50.968
Full of whiskey
and self-pity.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.303
That's right.

22:52.305 --> 22:54.038
There's nothing
i can do for him.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.140
And i'll let you in
on a little secret:

22:56.142 --> 22:58.008
I'm no fortune-teller.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.111
I could've told
you that, sugar.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.249
We're on the grift.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.017
Me and stanley.

23:07.019 --> 23:11.355
"mr. Spencer" is not
a hollywood talent scout.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.990
He's not?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.992
We're business partners.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.827
Have been for years.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.062
Maggie:
<i>Paper! Get your paper!</i>

23:18.064 --> 23:19.230
<i>Who wants a paper?</i>

23:19.232 --> 23:20.698
<i>Kansas city star!</i>

23:20.700 --> 23:22.266
Paper?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.569
(watch ticking)

23:25.571 --> 23:27.505
Get your paper!

23:27.507 --> 23:29.173
<i>Kansas city star!</i>

23:29.175 --> 23:30.741
Paper, paper!

23:42.388 --> 23:44.555
I caught you,
you little scamp.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.590
Show me what's under
your coat. Come on.
Get your hands off me,

23:46.592 --> 23:48.359
You pervert.
Stanley:
Officer!

23:48.361 --> 23:50.194
Officer, please. Please.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.929
Forgive my boy.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.364
He just got a part

23:53.366 --> 23:55.533
In the stage production
of <i> oliver twist.</i>

23:55.535 --> 23:56.901
Now, he's come
from such privilege

23:56.903 --> 23:58.369
That he wanted to see
what it felt like

23:58.371 --> 23:59.603
To be poor
and hungry.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.038
Maggie:
<i>Stanley didn't think</i>

24:01.040 --> 24:02.373
<i>I was so convincing.</i>

24:02.375 --> 24:04.141
Offered to make me his partner

24:04.143 --> 24:06.377
For ten cents on the dollar.

24:06.379 --> 24:09.747
That was big money
for me, back then.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.416
So, your parents...

24:12.418 --> 24:14.819
They just let you
go off with this man?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.122
I didn't have parents.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.757
Not really.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.460
I had to fend for myself, and...

24:22.462 --> 24:23.928
Well, stanley fed me,

24:23.930 --> 24:25.396
Kept me out of the rain.

24:25.398 --> 24:27.064
And he never laid
a finger on me.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.299
So you all
are criminals?

24:28.301 --> 24:30.067
What could you
possibly want

24:30.069 --> 24:31.635
With a bunch of
freaks like us?

24:34.474 --> 24:35.806
We're fleecing your customers.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.777
When the lights go down,
we pick their pockets.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.580
Oh, you all came down here
to jupiter, florida,

24:42.582 --> 24:44.815
To pick a bunch
of pockets?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.584
I wasn't born
on a farm,

24:46.586 --> 24:48.752
But i do know bullshit
when i smell it,

24:48.754 --> 24:50.488
And i gotta say...
That is some bullshit.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.424
Go to hell, triple tits.

24:53.426 --> 24:55.593
Come to think of it...

24:55.595 --> 24:57.328
Been a lot of trouble
around here

24:57.330 --> 24:58.762
Since you two showed up.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.431
Lot of freaks been dying.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.433
Ma petite and ethel,

25:02.435 --> 25:03.868
Now salty.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.536
I killed 'em all.
Every last one of them.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.137
Is that what you want to hear?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.706
You listen to me,
little girl,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.441
And you listen good.

25:10.443 --> 25:12.109
Now, you can tell me
anything you want,

25:12.111 --> 25:13.377
But don't let me find out

25:13.379 --> 25:14.812
That you and
your weasel friend

25:14.814 --> 25:16.680
Had anything to do
with hurting our kind,

25:16.682 --> 25:20.351
Or i will kill you dead.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.086
Now, are we clear?

25:34.467 --> 25:36.200
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.035
Well, gold star for you,

25:38.037 --> 25:40.137
'cause here i am.
Bette:
We want to help.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.806
Dot and i don't
have much.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.976
We were saving
for something,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.978
But our plans
have changed.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.147
We want you to have it.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.482
Use this money

25:51.484 --> 25:52.950
To get jimmy a proper lawyer.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.153
Let me get this straight:

25:56.155 --> 25:58.989
You want me to use
your hard-earned pennies

25:58.991 --> 26:00.224
To save
jimmy.
Mm-hmm
.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.358
Do it
yourself.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.826
Maybe he'll even reward you

26:02.828 --> 26:05.095
With a big, fat kiss.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.530
Dot:
<i>I'm going to punch her</i>
<i>in the face.</i>

26:06.532 --> 26:08.866
Bette:
<i>Don't let her get to you.</i>

26:08.868 --> 26:10.534
<i>Let me handle this.</i>

26:10.536 --> 26:12.503
People don't
always take

26:12.505 --> 26:14.538
Too kindly to us
at first glance.

26:14.540 --> 26:18.075
You can be
his champion,

26:18.077 --> 26:20.511
Like margaret o'sullivan
in <i> let us live,</i>

26:20.513 --> 26:22.379
Crusading to save
henry fonda.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.681
I hate to break it to you,

26:23.683 --> 26:26.016
But life is not like
the movies,

26:26.018 --> 26:28.252
You simple-minded idiot.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.088
Don't you talk
about my sister like that!

26:33.025 --> 26:35.359
Jimmy thinks you walk on water,

26:35.361 --> 26:37.761
But you don't fool me.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.363
You are a phony.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.031
And you don't
really love jimmy.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.867
Because when you love someone,
they come first.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.536
Oh, brother.

26:45.538 --> 26:48.105
Next you'll be telling me
that love conquers all.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.774
How can you be so cold?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.209
Jimmy could end up
like meep.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.945
Is that what you want?

26:59.385 --> 27:00.951
You do right by jimmy.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.668
Darling, you got a visitor.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.945
Oh... It's you.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.980
Stanley (scoffs):
Who were you hoping to see,

27:29.982 --> 27:32.282
Mickey mantle?

27:32.284 --> 27:35.319
I'm sorry. It's...

27:35.321 --> 27:37.021
It's nice of you to come.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.595
Listen.

27:44.597 --> 27:47.431
I know exactly
what you're feeling.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.434
I...

27:50.436 --> 27:53.937
I lost my mother
when i was young.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.974
Suddenly i was all
alone in the world.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.777
An orphan.

27:59.779 --> 28:03.013
And i got into some trouble.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.450
Well, not the kind
of trouble you're in.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.555
Listen, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.525
Did you do it?

28:14.527 --> 28:15.759
I...

28:16.729 --> 28:18.729
I...

28:19.865 --> 28:23.133
I don't know. I don't know.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.870
I've been over it
and over it in my head.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.174
I had too much to drink.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.711
I was in a rage about my ma,
my life, everything.

28:33.713 --> 28:35.312
But from the moment
i got to the house,

28:35.314 --> 28:36.647
Till the moment
i woke up here

28:36.649 --> 28:38.148
Is just black.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.216
So you admit you were there?

28:39.218 --> 28:40.317
I couldn't have done it.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.554
I-i didn't kill them.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.190
Did i?

28:46.192 --> 28:48.325
I don't think you did.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.860
That's why i'm here.

28:49.862 --> 28:53.864
I am gonna get you the best
lawyer money can buy.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.366
You've no doubt heard
of clarence darrow.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.837
The mo... The monkey trial?
Isn't he dead?

28:59.839 --> 29:01.572
Yeah, but the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

29:01.574 --> 29:05.242
His son donald is an
absolutely brilliant attorney.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.178
I've made some inquiries.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.346
He's interested in your case.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.514
But from now on,

29:10.516 --> 29:12.516
You got to shut up.

29:12.518 --> 29:16.420
The only talking you're
gonna do is to your lawyer.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.522
I don't know....

29:18.524 --> 29:20.357
I don't know how to thank you.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.925
(laughs)

29:21.927 --> 29:24.428
You don't owe me a thing.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.029
But, you know, that attorney,

29:26.031 --> 29:27.197
That's a different matter.

29:27.199 --> 29:30.234
He's going to want a retainer.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.770
I don't have any money.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.607
Well, what about ethel's estate?

29:36.609 --> 29:38.542
She leave you anything?

29:38.544 --> 29:40.377
I don't have anything
of value to give you,

29:40.379 --> 29:42.813
Mr. Spencer.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.686
Shit!

29:55.427 --> 29:57.127
(snapping)

29:59.298 --> 30:01.799
I might have an idea about

30:01.801 --> 30:03.867
How to raise the funds.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.811
Okay, beef chuck.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.713
Arm, shoulder or blade.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.751
Salt.

30:20.753 --> 30:23.754
Pepper.

30:23.756 --> 30:25.989
Flour.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.659
Onions.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.464
Ah... Horseradish.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.900
Carrots and potatoes.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.803
Thank you.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.672
I mean, it's just
a goddamn pot roast, right?

30:41.674 --> 30:44.274
How hard can it be?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.977
Say it isn't so. Huh.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.980
Toughest woman i know and now
you want to be betty crocker?

30:49.982 --> 30:51.448
Damn straight.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.616
If i'm gonna be a homemaker,

30:52.618 --> 30:54.284
I can't let my babies starve.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.787
My mother taught
all my sisters how to cook,

30:56.789 --> 30:58.789
But she never taught me.

30:58.791 --> 31:01.992
Maybe she saw your
potential elsewhere.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.395
Girl... Don't butter me up.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.632
Hmm? I haven't forgotten
what you told me.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.468
And i haven't decided what
i'm gonna do about it yet.

31:11.470 --> 31:15.005
But believe you me...

31:15.007 --> 31:17.741
I want to do
the right thing for once.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.143
That's why i'm here.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.812
We can't talk here.

31:21.814 --> 31:23.981
Just follow me.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.148
<i>I want to help jimmy.</i>

31:25.150 --> 31:27.384
Good. Get him a lawyer.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.886
I need you to trust me.
Trust you?

31:28.888 --> 31:30.854
Ha! That's a laugh.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.191
Everyone in this entire camp
will be dead soon

31:34.193 --> 31:35.359
Unless you listen to me.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.860
I know how to help everyone.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.363
Jimmy and the freaks
all at once.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.232
I just have to connect the dots.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.001
Place blame where it's due.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.003
Put the real villain
away forever.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.839
I don't like riddles!
Never have.

31:48.841 --> 31:50.007
Listen!

31:50.009 --> 31:51.842
I know you want to

31:51.844 --> 31:53.877
Ride off into the sunset
with your prince charming

31:53.879 --> 31:56.013
And your pot roasts, but

31:56.015 --> 31:58.582
I need you to help me first.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.285
There's something
i need you to see.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.867
Good coffee.

32:16.869 --> 32:18.402
Fresh brewed?

32:18.404 --> 32:20.103
It's sanka.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.372
My husband has trouble sleeping.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.374
I understand.
I have, too, lately.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.809
So much change.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.615
I think she is
happy to see you.

32:32.718 --> 32:33.884
Hi, pepper.

32:33.886 --> 32:37.054
She doesn't never talk.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.922
Uh...

32:38.924 --> 32:41.258
She probably remembers me

32:41.260 --> 32:44.094
Leaving her at the orphanage.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.563
Elsa:
<i>Yes.</i>

32:46.565 --> 32:49.433
Where i had the great
good fortune of finding her.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.568
Is that right?
Hmm?

32:51.570 --> 32:53.136
Well...

32:53.138 --> 32:55.739
Well.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.275
I couldn't keep her.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.144
I told myself, rita,
you will never meet a man

33:01.146 --> 33:03.146
And have a children if i have

33:03.148 --> 33:05.315
To look after
a dim-witted sister.

33:05.317 --> 33:09.186
I... I always wanted the babies.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.520
Of course.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.956
We all have our dreams,
don't we?

33:12.958 --> 33:15.625
And where are they now--
your children--

33:15.627 --> 33:18.128
Are they at school?

33:18.130 --> 33:19.796
No, i didn't have any.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.598
'cause i had piped clogs.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.632
What?

33:22.634 --> 33:24.768
Clogged pipes.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.436
Something. I don't know.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.438
I just couldn't have any.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.141
Oh, well, so much the better.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.310
She will be
great company for you.

33:33.312 --> 33:37.014
And no trouble at all.

33:37.016 --> 33:40.617
I have taught her words.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.186
And responsibility.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.855
How to care for others.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.492
Even how to make a
stiff singapore sling.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.127
You enjoy cocktails,
mrs. Gayhart?

33:50.129 --> 33:52.029
I do.
Mm-hmm.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.164
I love many cocktails.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.833
But, miss mars,

33:56.835 --> 34:00.137
What am i supposed
to tell larry my husband?

34:00.139 --> 34:03.306
I mean, he don't
even know she exists.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.978
Well, you tell him
that you have a lovely sister,

34:08.981 --> 34:11.181
Which is true.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.350
And then you tell him

34:13.351 --> 34:15.719
That she has come
to live with you.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.222
No, i just can't do that.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.491
You can and you must.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.694
This is your sister.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.830
Now, you may think
that i'm leaving you a burden,

34:26.831 --> 34:29.032
But i am not.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.234
Pepper is a gift.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.705
A soul so pure

34:35.706 --> 34:38.074
It's rare in this world.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.978
You're right.
I know you're right.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.684
Larry's gonna hit the roof.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.918
Well, stand up to him!

34:50.688 --> 34:54.591
Pepper has suffered
great losses.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.228
And i fear

34:58.230 --> 35:01.598
That she will perish
from loneliness

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
And a broken heart

35:03.602 --> 35:05.035
If she does not have

35:05.037 --> 35:07.104
Someone who loves her.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.111
Okay.

35:15.581 --> 35:18.448
I guess she can help me
around here.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.789
I'll go make up
the castro convertible.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.559
He's gonna have conniptions.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.461
That room's his study.

35:31.463 --> 35:35.132
Uh, 'cause of all the
studying and everything,

35:35.134 --> 35:37.634
The study stuff.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.771
Stay.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.773
No, darling.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.309
No, my darling.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.644
No.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.813
I cannot stay.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.882
I cannot stay, my darling.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.460
Well...

36:03.462 --> 36:06.496
You and i've known each other

36:06.498 --> 36:10.267
A very long time.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.372
And i understand you
even without words.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.841
I know all you ever wanted

36:17.843 --> 36:20.110
Was a family.

36:20.112 --> 36:22.946
So, you just remember

36:22.948 --> 36:26.283
No matter how far away i am,

36:26.285 --> 36:30.220
I will always be your family.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.525
Now, here. Here, my darling,

36:35.527 --> 36:37.494
Is a kiss

36:37.496 --> 36:39.796
From me to you.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.665
If you get lonely,

36:41.667 --> 36:44.301
You hold it to your cheek

36:44.303 --> 36:47.971
And i'll be there, okay?

36:47.973 --> 36:51.975
Listen.

36:51.977 --> 36:55.845
Your sister
doesn't know you yet.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.148
She may make mistakes.

36:58.150 --> 36:59.883
She may hurt your feelings.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.985
But you must forgive her.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.754
She's a good person.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.591
And she is trying, okay?

37:07.593 --> 37:10.360
Now, say good-bye.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.896
(whimpering)
no, no, no, no.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.365
No crying.
(laughs)

37:15.367 --> 37:17.267
Because if you cry
then i will cry

37:17.269 --> 37:20.670
And then what will
happen to my mascara?

37:20.672 --> 37:23.139
Huh?

37:25.344 --> 37:28.345
(door opens)

37:28.347 --> 37:30.814
(door closes)

37:38.857 --> 37:42.025
The american morbidity museum?

37:42.027 --> 37:45.095
Why we got to travel all this
way for skeletons and such?

37:45.097 --> 37:47.364
Because i need
a witness to this

37:47.366 --> 37:49.733
In case something happens to me
when stanley's called out.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.701
All this here is
because of him?

37:51.703 --> 37:53.203
Lillian:
And another recent acquisition

37:53.205 --> 37:55.372
Of which we're very proud--

37:55.374 --> 37:57.073
A male died from natural causes.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.209
Sweet jesus!
And as you can see, the skull

37:59.211 --> 38:02.746
Is a classic representation
of microcephaly.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.448
He got paid $3,000
for ma petite's body.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.916
That's why he had her killed.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.318
Wha...?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.153
Lillian:
We removed the brain
of the specimen

38:10.155 --> 38:14.124
And found the weight
of the organ to be 33%

38:14.126 --> 38:17.927
Lighter than that
of a normal adult male.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.297
Shall we?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.741
Lillian:
And this is our newest exhibit.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.910
It's just arrived today.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.080
It is a perfect
example of a rare

38:37.082 --> 38:40.817
Congenital defect known as

38:40.819 --> 38:42.986
Ectrodactyly.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.621
Commonly referred to

38:44.623 --> 38:46.489
As lobster hands.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.659
No...

39:04.509 --> 39:07.177
I gave it everything.

39:07.179 --> 39:10.947
We both did, me and larry.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.117
But i guess
that genes are genes.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.518
Woman:
Uh-huh.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.721
Like my uncle charlie says,

39:17.723 --> 39:20.590
"a goat's a goat
and not a chicken."

39:22.627 --> 39:25.061
But god loves us all.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.832
I...

39:28.834 --> 39:31.801
I added that last part
about god.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.871
<i>So, next question.</i>

39:34.873 --> 39:40.710
"reason for patient's
confinement."

39:40.712 --> 39:44.347
Can you tell me
when the problem started?

39:44.349 --> 39:48.351
Well i'd wanted a baby
ever since i met larry,

39:48.353 --> 39:50.820
But i'd given up.

39:50.822 --> 39:54.657
And then two weeks
before my 50th,

39:54.659 --> 39:56.826
Your god plays a big ol' joke.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.862
I wake up in the
middle of the night

39:58.864 --> 40:00.864
With the worst stomachache.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.732
Larry rushes me to the hospital,

40:02.734 --> 40:05.702
And they tell me,
"mrs. Gayhart,

40:05.704 --> 40:09.172
You're having the labor pains."

40:09.174 --> 40:11.741
12 hours of crazy later,

40:11.743 --> 40:13.810
They hand me
little lucas.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.752
N-not to be rude,
but, um...

40:22.754 --> 40:25.388
You're a little...

40:25.390 --> 40:27.390
Mature...

40:27.392 --> 40:29.392
To be having a baby,
aren't you?

40:29.394 --> 40:32.362
God doesn't always
give with both hands.

40:32.364 --> 40:36.433
Now, lucas was different
than your normal baby.

40:38.370 --> 40:42.272
He was...

40:42.274 --> 40:44.274
Deformed.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.409
But to us

40:46.411 --> 40:48.244
<i>He was our perfect</i>
<i>little miracle.</i>

40:48.246 --> 40:50.447
(baby crying)

40:50.449 --> 40:53.450
"trouble started

40:53.452 --> 40:58.087
"when baby is born

40:58.089 --> 41:02.158
To patient's
guardians."

41:04.763 --> 41:06.329
Then what?

41:06.331 --> 41:09.332
Well, due to the difficult
delivery, and my age,

41:09.334 --> 41:11.334
I was stuck to my bed.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.803
(baby crying)

41:15.640 --> 41:18.641
<i>At first, pepper was</i>
<i>eager to help out.</i>

41:18.643 --> 41:20.977
<i>I thought--</i>
<i>well, she's not too bright,</i>

41:20.979 --> 41:24.047
<i>But she just might have</i>
<i>the mothering instinct.</i>

41:28.420 --> 41:29.986
Pepper,

41:29.988 --> 41:32.055
Make me another
martini?

41:34.926 --> 41:37.360
(baby fussing)

41:39.598 --> 41:42.665
Mm... Can't you
take him with you?

41:46.605 --> 41:50.673
<i>Well, turns out,</i>
<i>she had a few other instincts.</i>

41:51.676 --> 41:53.610
(baby crying)

41:53.612 --> 41:56.446
<i>Like sneaking gin,</i>
<i>which we only keep around</i>

41:56.448 --> 41:58.481
<i>For guests who might enjoy</i>
<i>a cocktail.</i>

41:58.483 --> 41:59.482
Pepper?

41:59.484 --> 42:01.117
What's taking so long?!

42:01.119 --> 42:03.286
(baby crying)

42:03.288 --> 42:05.355
Oh...

42:07.392 --> 42:09.726
Pepper?

42:11.496 --> 42:13.563
Shh...

42:15.200 --> 42:17.634
(baby crying)

42:22.474 --> 42:23.840
Ooh, ca...
Ooh, w-whoa...

42:23.842 --> 42:25.375
You're spilling it.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.876
Where's the
little onion?

42:26.878 --> 42:28.878
Oh, for christ's sake,

42:28.880 --> 42:30.480
Set it down
on the nightstand.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.048
Set it down.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.816
(baby crying)

42:33.818 --> 42:35.818
Ugh.
(baby continues to cry)

42:35.820 --> 42:37.887
(moans)

42:39.824 --> 42:41.190
Ugh.

42:41.192 --> 42:42.392
(door opens)

42:42.394 --> 42:44.661
Jesus christ!

42:44.663 --> 42:46.863
If there was some way
you could make money

42:46.865 --> 42:49.165
Off of that freak's screams
or that thing's face,

42:49.167 --> 42:51.167
We'd be millionaires.

42:51.169 --> 42:54.337
Just take
the baby downstairs.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.873
You and him can
watch the tv.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.342
(crying continues)

42:59.344 --> 43:02.412
The <i> tv.</i>

43:04.416 --> 43:08.618
(with slow cadence): Do you
know how to turn on the tv?

43:08.620 --> 43:10.286
Larry:
Come on, get up.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.455
Come on, come on,
we're going downstairs.

43:12.457 --> 43:14.257
Let's go!

43:14.259 --> 43:17.260
<i>And then there was</i>
<i>the obsession with my husband.</i>

43:17.262 --> 43:20.196
<i>Scheming ways</i>
<i>to get alone with him.</i>

43:20.198 --> 43:22.398
I'll show her.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.968
You just can't wait
to get alone with her, can you?

43:27.939 --> 43:30.273
Some women just
shouldn't have kids.

43:36.214 --> 43:39.282
Pretty soon, she's walking
around without any clothes on.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.050
Bare-ass naked.

43:41.052 --> 43:43.720
Can you believe it?

43:43.722 --> 43:46.723
"obsessed...

43:46.725 --> 43:48.825
With husband."

43:52.897 --> 43:54.564
Truthfully,

43:54.566 --> 43:57.133
A lot of our patients
here, they...

43:57.135 --> 43:58.801
They suffer with a, um...

44:00.271 --> 44:03.339
...A lack of inhibition.

44:03.341 --> 44:06.776
But the... The shock
therapy helps with that.

44:06.778 --> 44:09.479
And the... And
the caning helps, too.

44:12.651 --> 44:14.917
Well, do they help with
the killer's instinct?

44:14.919 --> 44:17.353
'cause that's
what she has.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.657
She's a murderer.

44:20.659 --> 44:21.824
My very own sister.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.092
Oh, dear.

44:23.094 --> 44:24.627
Oh...

44:24.629 --> 44:25.828
Oh, no.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.597
I-i-i... Um...

44:27.599 --> 44:30.500
I-i need to ask you

44:30.502 --> 44:32.568
To describe exactly
what happened.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.438
(sighs)

44:35.440 --> 44:38.508
Well, thankfully, neither of us
actually saw what happened.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.484
Where do you think
you're going?

44:48.486 --> 44:52.555
I thought we should
go to the lamplight.

44:55.694 --> 44:57.760
Have some steaks.

45:00.699 --> 45:02.865
Have a bottle
of wine.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.902
(laughing)

45:05.904 --> 45:08.905
Like real people.

45:08.907 --> 45:11.240
Aren't you afraid that
mongoloid with the baby?

45:11.242 --> 45:13.676
Might drop it on its head
and kill it.

45:13.678 --> 45:15.311
Which wouldn't be
the worst thing to happen.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.312
I don't want to
talk about them.

45:16.314 --> 45:17.513
Listen, rita.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.215
Ah-la-la-la-la-la, la!
Rita, rita.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.184
Rita, goddamn it,
this is no life!

45:21.186 --> 45:22.985
(baby cries)

45:22.987 --> 45:25.354
Just a constant smell of that
baby frankenstein's shit,

45:25.356 --> 45:28.357
'cause that thing is too
dumb to wash diapers.

45:28.359 --> 45:33.362
With her ugly mug and elephant
ears and the smiling--

45:33.364 --> 45:35.364
"pepper good girl,
pepper good girl."

45:35.366 --> 45:37.567
It's like a permanent
freak show around here.

45:37.569 --> 45:39.569
You think i'm
any happier?!

45:39.571 --> 45:43.706
Stuck in here with them
all day in, day out!

45:43.708 --> 45:46.175
Day in, day out...

45:46.177 --> 45:48.244
She's so dumb, i hurt.

45:50.181 --> 45:52.582
And he makes me want
to squeeze the life

45:52.584 --> 45:55.651
Out of his little baby
body half the time.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.590
So...

46:00.592 --> 46:02.759
You and i, we're on
the same page about this.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.827
(crying continues)

46:05.764 --> 46:08.364
You never bonded with that baby.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.832
Admit it.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.036
Say, "i never bonded
with that baby."

46:14.038 --> 46:15.772
Say it.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.775
(crying continues)

46:18.777 --> 46:21.210
I never bonded
with that baby.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.880
Me, i'd be happy to see
the two of them gone.

46:23.882 --> 46:26.115
Gone?

46:26.117 --> 46:29.118
As in...?

46:31.055 --> 46:33.055
I could never murder
my own sister.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.891
N-n-n-no, hear me out.

46:34.893 --> 46:39.262
What if i had a way to kill
two birds with one stone?

46:39.264 --> 46:42.231
(crying continues)

46:42.233 --> 46:46.302
I was at the park with the baby
all afternoon.

46:47.972 --> 46:52.608
I was worn out, so i asked her
to please give him his bath.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.644
(baby cooing)

46:56.247 --> 46:58.714
(footsteps approaching)

47:01.419 --> 47:03.920
(door creaking)

47:09.360 --> 47:11.427
¶ ¶

47:15.466 --> 47:17.667
(baby cooing)

47:33.785 --> 47:35.852
(baby screams)

47:50.001 --> 47:53.102
(clattering)

47:57.876 --> 47:59.942
(screams)

48:02.914 --> 48:05.848
Rita: <i> She snapped</i>
<i>his little ears off.</i>

48:05.850 --> 48:07.850
<i>Drowned him in his tub.</i>

48:07.852 --> 48:10.920
<i>Then went downstairs</i>
<i>to watch her show.</i>

48:26.371 --> 48:28.371
She killed him!

48:28.373 --> 48:30.172
She killed him!
She killed him...

48:30.174 --> 48:31.507
Oh, god.

48:31.509 --> 48:34.343
(screams):
Oh, god!

48:34.345 --> 48:37.613
He's gone! He's
gone, he's gone.

48:59.370 --> 49:02.071
She ruined my life.

49:02.073 --> 49:04.273
You must never

49:04.275 --> 49:07.176
Ever let her
out of here.

49:15.253 --> 49:18.321
(rhythmic thumping)

49:31.602 --> 49:33.069
(keys jangling)

49:33.071 --> 49:35.905
Sister eunice:
Hush.

49:35.907 --> 49:38.975
Self-pity will
get you nowhere.

49:42.246 --> 49:43.746
Any more of that and...

49:43.748 --> 49:46.916
I'll put you
in a scalding bath.

49:46.918 --> 49:49.986
Then you'll really
feel sorry for yourself.

49:52.957 --> 49:55.157
I need to get you
out of this thing.

49:55.159 --> 49:58.327
I have to put you in the
decontamination shower.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.129
What you did--

50:00.131 --> 50:02.832
That's one of the worst
ever things i've heard.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.934
Maybe in my whole life.

50:04.936 --> 50:06.936
It made me throw up.

50:06.938 --> 50:10.072
Actually... Throw up.

50:11.642 --> 50:13.209
Baby.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.512
Baby.
Yes,

50:16.514 --> 50:19.115
That's right.
You killed a baby.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.117
And that poor mother.

50:21.119 --> 50:24.120
You ruined her life.

50:24.122 --> 50:26.655
Baby lucas.

50:26.657 --> 50:29.692
Yes, that's the baby's name.
Lucas.

50:31.629 --> 50:34.230
Lucas.

50:36.467 --> 50:37.967
Oh, my heavens.

50:37.969 --> 50:41.203
Is this...

50:41.205 --> 50:42.638
Are you...

50:42.640 --> 50:44.206
Is that real?

50:46.344 --> 50:49.045
Do i see real remorse

50:49.047 --> 50:51.013
In your eyes?

50:51.015 --> 50:53.549
Is redemption
closer than i thought?

50:55.720 --> 50:57.053
Oh...

50:57.055 --> 51:00.222
Oh, thank you, dear lord,

51:00.224 --> 51:03.392
For your lesson in humility.

51:10.501 --> 51:12.835
Since sister priscilla left,

51:12.837 --> 51:16.505
We've had no one
to tidy things up in here.

51:16.507 --> 51:18.574
Why don't you start
by making piles.

51:20.378 --> 51:23.212
<i>Life...</i>

51:23.214 --> 51:25.681
In the <i> life</i> pile.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.683
<i>National geographic...</i>

51:27.685 --> 51:30.019
In another pile.

51:30.021 --> 51:32.755
<i>Reader's digest...</i>

51:32.757 --> 51:34.824
In another.

51:47.371 --> 51:48.871
You...

51:48.873 --> 51:52.241
Are my special
project.

51:52.243 --> 51:55.544
No filthy
toilet scrubbing.

51:55.546 --> 51:58.280
I am determined to bring
out the best in you.

52:04.922 --> 52:08.524
Maybe soon you can work
in the bakery with me.
