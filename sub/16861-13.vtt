00:01.376 --> 00:03.420
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:03.712 --> 00:05.380
Hey, kid. What are you doing here?

00:05.380 --> 00:07.173
- You're in the hospital.
- What?

00:07.173 --> 00:10.176
You had a heart attack but you're fine.
You're in really good hands.

00:10.635 --> 00:11.636
Janet's pregnant.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.306
It wasn't planned.
Y'know, it just happened.

00:15.306 --> 00:18.768
I want this, whether it's his or yours.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.730
I want this child to replace
what we lost.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.193
Dispatch, dispatch.
10-13 officer down.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.945
Dispatch, officer down.
We need an ambulance.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.114
Johnny's dead. They shot him.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.116
- Wow!
- Oh!

00:33.116 --> 00:36.202
I'm a friend of Lou's.
I'll just be a minute.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.287
Nice.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.330
- Yeah, she's cute, huh?
- Yeah.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.460
I have one boundary, Lou.
One boundary and one boundary only.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.712
No sex with nuns in the place
where I live.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.130
This is gonna sound kind of strange,

00:47.130 --> 00:49.507
but I think I'm getting submarined
by a retard.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.718
You and me,
this ain't about power, Richie.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.303
It's about both of us loving Natalie.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.555
I think we got some stuff in common.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.433
- Like what?
- We're both smarter than we look.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.812
Let's just take this three and turn it
into a big what if stack.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.565
Um, we totally picked it
in the same order.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.818
I'm actually interested
in this one specifically.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.028
I'll take it!

01:10.028 --> 01:12.989
- Mike's gay.
- Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.534
Oh, you mean, gay gay.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.579
I'm getting married!

01:19.579 --> 01:23.166
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you Mr. And Mrs...

01:23.917 --> 01:25.168
Gavity.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.800
Did you, um, give any more thought
to, you know, the boat?

01:31.800 --> 01:32.967
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.636
- (OVER PHONE) <i>And?</i>
- I'm in.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.763
Goddamn! Sorry.

01:36.763 --> 01:40.850
I made my decision.
I'm gonna leave the FDNY.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.860
Oh, goddamn it.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.945
Hello.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.988
Whoa! Good morning, grouchy.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.158
Goddamn it. You made me spill my coffee.
It's all over the side of the truck.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.661
- What kind of a flavor is it?
- My favorite flavor, brown.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.745
Okay? What's up?

02:00.745 --> 02:03.456
Um, I was just wondering if you
were putting in your papers today?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.541
What?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.750
You told me you were quitting.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.460
Thought you were putting your papers in.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.463
Look, first of all, I'm not quitting,
okay. I'm retiring. All right?

02:10.463 --> 02:13.133
Baby, look, you've been on
the job for 20 years.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.510
All you got to do is go
down to headquarters and just do it.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.263
You don't got to go
through Lou or Jerry or...

02:18.263 --> 02:19.430
Yeah. Whatever.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.432
You're not getting cold feet,
are you?

02:21.432 --> 02:23.810
Look, I told you I was quitting.
I'm quitting, all right?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.478
Okay, okay.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.522
Look, I have this great idea.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.733
I think this weekend,
you and me at the house.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.527
At our house.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.987
I'm gonna go get furniture.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.197
It's not gonna be perfect
but I'm gonna bust my ass

02:36.197 --> 02:38.074
and um, make sure it's really nice.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.242
Does that sound good?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.119
- Yeah. I got to go.
- Yeah, me, too.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.291
- Hey.
- Hey, Tommy.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.586
- That coffee? Is it brown? Thanks.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.838
- Hey, what'd you spill on your pants.
- Nothing.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.756
When I tell you
to check on the tanks,

02:53.756 --> 02:55.758
I want you to check
on the goddamn tanks, probie.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.052
- This is a job, not a hobby.
- Sorry, chief.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.721
- What?
- Sorry, chief, I'll get on it.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.223
Goddamn probies.
They're killing me.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.976
Are you out of your mind?

03:04.976 --> 03:07.729
Kenny, never say never.
You ever hear that expression?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.439
Yeah, I've heard it and I'm
saying never.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.608
Listen, they have really good pitching
this season.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.484
Hold up. Stay out of this,
will you, probie?

03:13.484 --> 03:15.195
- Go pick your ass or something.
- Yeah.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.363
Listen to me for a second.

03:17.363 --> 03:21.034
Wait a minute. Listen, you're actually
saying that it will never happen.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.454
You're saying that with all certainty
and an unclouded mind.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.498
Yes, I'm saying the Boston Red Sox
will never win a world series.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.792
Not in our lifetimes,
not in our children's lifetimes,

03:29.918 --> 03:31.294
not in their children's lifetimes.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.755
I mean, if there's even a world around
to have series in. Okay?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.506
- Ten thousand bucks.
- What?

03:35.506 --> 03:38.051
I'm betting you ten grand it happens.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.850
Way to go, Tommy boy!

03:45.850 --> 03:47.936
Still knocking out them
cabbage, huh? All right!

03:47.936 --> 03:50.230
This is for the little
beautiful little baby Katy.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.857
I like that name.
I have an aunt named Kate.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.486
- Lesbo, but-- What?
- Be serious.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.155
Because your lovely bride
is gonna be up all night

03:59.155 --> 04:02.659
too exhausted to give you the good loving,
we got you a doll, too.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.910
Kenny!

04:07.956 --> 04:11.000
Her name is Jennifer
and she enjoys

04:11.000 --> 04:14.003
long walks on the beach,
sunsets, and fondue.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.590
Her turn-offs
are static electricity and pins.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.188
Hey, care to join us, Tom?
It's a fire. We're all invited.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.158
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:44.158 --> 04:47.328
<i>With these ropes I tied
Can we do no wrong?</i>

04:47.328 --> 04:50.665
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

04:50.665 --> 04:53.918
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

04:53.918 --> 04:57.130
<i>With my teeth locked down
I could see the blood</i>

04:57.130 --> 05:00.508
<i>Of a thousand men who have come and gone</i>

05:00.508 --> 05:03.886
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

05:03.886 --> 05:06.723
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:09.809
<i>-Is it safe to say?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:13.146
<i>-Was it right to leave?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:13.146 --> 05:16.316
<i>- Will I ever learn?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:16.316 --> 05:20.194
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:24.532 --> 05:28.161
Yes, well, thank you anyway.
You're amazingly helpful as always.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.912
- Jesus Christ!
- Who's that?

05:30.038 --> 05:32.206
It's HQ. I call 'em up.
I tell 'em we don't have a chief.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.833
They tell me,
"No, we sent somebody over."

05:33.833 --> 05:35.501
- Must have been Izzy?
- No, it's not Izzy.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.795
I mean, he's y'know,
he's got his own crew to deal with.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.005
Same thing with Needles.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.008
They tell me this guy--
How do you pronounce this?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.385
P-E-C-H-E--

05:44.677 --> 05:47.597
- You got to be kidding me. This is gold.
- It's Pecher, right?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.807
I mean it's like shooting fish
in a goddamn barrel.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.975
You got so many options here.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.019
If he's an asshole,
you got peckerwood, peckerhead.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.562
If he's good-looking, Gregory Pecker.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.147
- If he's Black...
- Yeah?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.774
- Black and pepper.
- There you go.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.193
I just got to find the guy.
That's all now.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.779
Oh, by the way, Dennis and I,
you and me, special place

06:02.779 --> 06:04.447
- I'm taking you to, all right?
- Oh, cool.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.865
And dress up a little bit?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.700
I'm gonna be wearing
something off the shoulder.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.785
Okay.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.330
- Studying?
- I'm trying.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.668
- When's the test?
- Day after next.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.171
Phew.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.839
That came up fast, huh?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.341
I'll be fine.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.929
- You feel good?
- Feeling good.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.264
Good luck with it, man. Really.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.308
Thanks.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.979
Jesus Christ! Enough with
the goddamn chips already!

06:36.979 --> 06:39.107
I'm trying to study here, asshole!

06:44.987 --> 06:46.614
Hello.

06:47.949 --> 06:48.950
Hello?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.828
Excuse me.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.289
Just, uh--
Just grabbing a drink.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.083
You got chips on the floor here.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.419
I've been waiting my whole career, really,
to ask this question.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.670
Are you Chief Pecher?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.800
Pecher. It's French.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.593
French for pecker by any chance?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.931
Okay, I've heard
the pecker jokes before.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.766
You're not the first
to come up with that.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.560
I went through grade school.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.270
I went through the third grade twice.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.521
What's your name, hot shot?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.482
My name's Tommy Gavin.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.026
What if I made a little funny name
for you?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.154
What if I called you a...

07:28.948 --> 07:30.741
Let's get these chips cleaned up,
all right?

07:30.741 --> 07:31.993
Yeah.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.871
It's Pecher. Cher with a puh.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.664
Okay.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.296
What's this?
What's his name again?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.007
Far as I'm concerned, Chief Pussy. Okay?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.842
That's C with a puh in front of it.

07:52.054 --> 07:55.808
Holy shit! Nobody knocks anymore.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.436
- Get out of here, you perv.
- I'm sorry.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.271
I thought this was my office.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.731
Okay, you must be the new--

08:01.731 --> 08:03.900
We just got married so it's very--

08:04.192 --> 08:05.860
- Y'know...
- Can you get out?

08:05.860 --> 08:07.487
I had a magazine.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.238
- A magazine?
- Uh-huh.

08:09.697 --> 08:14.285
Okay. Honey, have you seen
a magazine anywhere? Yes.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.287
Here you go.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.624
- You got it? Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

08:19.624 --> 08:20.833
Get out!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.585
Congratulations.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.760
What the hell kind of joint is this?

08:30.885 --> 08:34.347
It's kind of a Japanese, <i>Tarzan</i> fusion.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.015
- Great review in the paper.
- Yeah?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.725
- Are these live fish?
- Yep.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.061
These aren't the fish that you order
off the menu and eat?

08:40.061 --> 08:41.562
Yeah, they are.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.898
- You didn't pick this place.
- I did.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.066
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.734
- No way you picked this place.
- I didn't.

08:46.734 --> 08:47.944
Theresa picked the place.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.737
- Theresa the nun?
- The semi-nun.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.821
Are you crazy?

08:50.821 --> 08:52.281
She's gonna meet us here for dinner.

08:52.281 --> 08:56.160
You got to give me a week's notice before
I can have dinner with a religious figure.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.204
What do you mean?
She's not a religious figure,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.540
it's Theresa, not Mother Theresa.
You a little jealous?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.458
Yeah, I'm jealous. Come on.
I'm worried. Okay?

09:02.583 --> 09:03.876
What am I gonna talk to her about?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.462
Vatican II? The Holy Ghost?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.422
I don't know
if it's called the Holy Ghost.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.551
Look, just think clean thoughts.
There she is.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.469
Goddamn it.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.304
- Shit.
- Hi.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.639
Maybe you better go outside and--

09:16.639 --> 09:18.808
Tell her I got a cell phone call.
Hello?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.060
Yeah, she'll buy that.
That looks real good.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.104
All right. Just, uh-- Y'know, just
read the questions.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.523
If I got an answer wrong, correct me.
Okay?

09:25.773 --> 09:27.108
- You ready?
- Go.

09:29.652 --> 09:34.574
How many bolts of current run through
the air train at Kennedy airport?

09:34.740 --> 09:35.741
Seven hundred and fifty.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.369
Nigga! Correct.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.499
What's the flash point temperature
of methanol?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.127
Methanol, methanol.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.798
Give me a second.
It's, um, 64 degrees Fahrenheit.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.425
Wrong.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.553
Fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.597
Shit.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.890
This is what I like to see.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.892
My two boys playing nice together.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.894
I'm helping him study.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.689
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.108
He's, y'know, firing questions,
trying to get me in the zone

10:09.108 --> 10:10.776
which I'm having a tough time
doing myself.

10:11.569 --> 10:16.032
At what point will an aluminum
transport tank BLEVE?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.159
And what does that stand for?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.119
BLEVE. Um...

10:20.578 --> 10:26.292
That's Boiling Liquid
Expansion Vapor Explode.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.836
And aluminum BLEVES at, uh...

10:28.836 --> 10:31.130
It won't. Steel will.

10:32.089 --> 10:36.594
Aluminum melts at 1,200 degrees.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.014
Where are you reading that
from, Rich?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.851
I read it when I looked
through the book

10:44.685 --> 10:45.895
And now I know it.

10:46.854 --> 10:47.938
I'm hungry.

10:49.607 --> 10:54.987
That BLEVE thing is on page 144,
if you want to look.

10:55.946 --> 10:56.947
Second paragraph.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.284
Thanks.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.499
He memorized the test book?

11:06.874 --> 11:09.335
Yeah, he's good at that kind of shit.
It's spooky.

11:12.254 --> 11:16.384
Hey, how you doing? It's Mike Siletti
from the club the other night.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.927
I'm a firefighter.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.346
Yeah. Hi, Sara. Um...

11:20.346 --> 11:22.431
Listen, I was thinking

11:22.431 --> 11:25.434
maybe like we could
hang out or something this week.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.610
Yeah, I was thinking
just me and you,

11:34.610 --> 11:38.239
but if you want your brother
to come along, yeah, that's cool.

11:38.239 --> 11:42.159
He seemed like a really nice guy,
so, yeah, that would be cool.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.412
Hey. Sorry, guys.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.790
I had to make a cell phone call.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.917
Yeah, that's what Ken said.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.086
Well, he was telling the truth--

11:52.086 --> 11:55.047
I mean, why would he lie?
I had a cell phone call.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.759
Lying is-- You're in that business.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.302
The sin business, right?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.804
You seem a little nervous, Tommy.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.682
Mm-mmm. No, not me.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.475
Yeah, you're drinking my water.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.144
Oh, shit. Sorry, sorry.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.979
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.108
So, Ken told me about your brother.
I'm sorry.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.484
How's your family doing?

12:15.484 --> 12:19.780
Y'know, it's not a great time. You know?

12:20.364 --> 12:21.490
Yeah.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.660
- Johnny was a good man.
- Yeah.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.705
Well, they're all good men.
I mean, police and firefighters.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.665
I don't know how you manage
with the specter of death

12:29.665 --> 12:31.667
hanging over you so presently
on a daily basis.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.462
How do you do that?
With that old specter hanging up there?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.088
Yeah, I guess I'm being selfish but--

12:36.088 --> 12:37.965
Sorry.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.427
It's okay.
I want, y'know, Ken to retire.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.304
Did you tell him about the boat?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.015
Oh, I did, I did.
He's a 100% behind it.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.641
- You are?
- Huge boat fan.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.478
- Oh, good.
- Big fan of the boat. Yes.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.146
We're gonna go to Montauk
on Thursday.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.106
Ken's cousin is gonna
bring up the boat.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.858
We're gonna spend
the whole day on the ocean.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.985
- I can't wait.
- Yeah. That'll be--

12:57.985 --> 12:59.862
I mean, I wish I could go
with you guys.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.907
I just don't want to feel like
a third wheel. Here's the salad.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.117
Boats don't have wheels, Tom,
except for the steering wheel.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.994
- Steering. Yeah, that.
- Thank you.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.955
No meat?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.337
- Amen.
- Amen.

13:17.797 --> 13:24.303
So, um, the Holy Ghost,
He's the Holy Spirit now, right?

13:24.845 --> 13:27.097
- The Holy Spirit, same.
- It's better.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.725
Take the whole horror movie
aspect out of it.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.353
Yeah, the curse right out of it.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.358
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.944
- Hiya, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- It's cool.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.488
It's fine, it's fine.
We're happy that you called.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.115
We were just sitting around
wondering what we're gonna do tonight.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.409
- So you guys live together?
- Yeah, to save money.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.080
Well... So, should we, um, get a drink?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.791
Or you want to just skip it
and go back to our place for some fun.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.419
I'm up for whatever
but when you say fun--

13:57.753 --> 13:58.796
I mean sex.

14:00.589 --> 14:04.009
Wow, cool. Great.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.889
We play together.
If that freaks you out.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.517
No. Not at all.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.936
- We don't mess around with each other. No.
- That would be weird.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.648
But we like to put somebody
in the middle and let things happen.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.066
You're bi, right?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.861
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.113
Bi guys are the best.

14:25.990 --> 14:26.991
I hear that a lot.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.035
Let's go.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.458
Come on.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.878
That's what I like, dropping
your date off at the convent.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.213
Dropping off who at the convent?

14:41.964 --> 14:48.053
- Hey. Lou has a friend who's a nun.
- Oh.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.347
- Dad!
- Hey, baby.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.682
What's going on?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.393
Colleen, say hello
to your dad.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.855
Nice. That's great.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.233
- What's up?
- Can we talk?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.068
I'll watch the girls.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.280
Hi, sweetie. How you doing?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.790
What are we gonna do?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.626
- About what?
- The baby.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.336
- What's wrong with the baby?
- Nothing.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.545
Have you told anyone about it?

15:21.545 --> 15:23.547
No, I didn't.
Why would I, about the baby?

15:23.547 --> 15:24.840
- Did you tell anybody?
- No.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.592
Okay. Well, then don't accuse me.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.595
So it's just you and me
and the doctor. Okay.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.013
Okay, so we need to have a plan.

15:31.013 --> 15:34.058
We have to come up with a plan.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.477
Okay, and you're the master liar
so just come up with something.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.938
I'm the master liar? Based on what?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.856
Oh, based on Angie and Sheila.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.900
And based on that blond bimbo
from across the street.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.693
Okay, okay. My brother and the Volvo.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.236
Oh, it's the safest car on the road.

15:46.236 --> 15:50.074
The ugliest car on the road.
Jesus! What?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.451
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.912
I want to watch <i>Cubs</i>
and Katy wants to watch <i>Big Love.</i>

15:54.912 --> 15:57.289
<i>Big Love, Big Love.</i>
Nobody's watching <i>Big Love,</i> Lou!

15:57.289 --> 15:58.874
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.292
What?

16:00.417 --> 16:01.794
Lou took off his shoes.
We're dying.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
If he takes off his pants,
then give us a call.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.756
Get out of here. Go, go, go.
Watch your fingers.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.387
- Okay, where were we? Right. Okay.
- You were coming up with a plan.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.222
And the plan is?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.808
- I'm thinking.
- Okay, okay.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.477
So you know what we do?
We pretend we're together.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.981
When the baby's born, I'll help you
raise it and if it's a boy,

16:21.981 --> 16:25.776
it's a grand slam 'cause that solves
my dad's problem with the male heir thing.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.654
What if the baby looks like Johnny?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.614
What?

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
- Like that's a possibility?
- Yeah.

16:33.033 --> 16:36.412
Both of Angie's kids look just
like Angie, nothing like Johnny.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.038
All right? My sperm versus
Johnny's sperm.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.373
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my gosh.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.375
My sperm--they have
ant strength. Okay?

16:41.375 --> 16:44.670
My sperm can lift the other sperm
out of the way. Ow. What?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.046
Who's Hitler?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.048
What are you talking about?

16:48.048 --> 16:50.968
Well, Uncle Lou's making us watch
the show about him and the Jews.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.678
- Lou!
- It's educational.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.929
These kids need some learning.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.764
They don't want to watch it.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.267
- Go.
- Wait, what's a sperm?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.647
It's a food.

17:03.939 --> 17:08.652
It's like spam except it's got,
y'know, more protein

17:08.777 --> 17:11.447
and it's hard to find in the store.
Get out of here. Okay?

17:11.447 --> 17:13.365
Oh, well, I thought it was
the stuff which comes out

17:13.365 --> 17:15.284
of a man's penis during intercourse.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.622
Go learn about the Jews.
Go, go, go, go, go.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.666
This has nothing to do with me, Tommy.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.418
- Where'd she get it?
- I don't know. School.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.003
They're teaching sperm in school?

17:26.003 --> 17:27.796
Okay. Can we just get back to
the subject?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.465
- Tommy, back to the subject.
- Okay, okay.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.884
If we're gonna sell this idea,
then maybe the girls and I

17:31.884 --> 17:33.385
ought to move back in here with you.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.222
That's not gonna work.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.726
- Why?
- Because I am thinking of moving.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.352
You are about to lie.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.271
I'm not about to lie.
What are you talking?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.356
- I know you. I smell a lie.
- You know me?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.025
Probably Lou's feet
from the other room.

17:48.025 --> 17:52.321
This place is too big,
too many bedrooms, not near the firehouse.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.117
Okay, listen to me. All right?

17:57.117 --> 18:00.954
I promise you I'm gonna take
care of you money-wise,

18:00.954 --> 18:04.124
whatever else you need,
y'know, during this pregnancy,

18:04.124 --> 18:09.004
I will be there for you.
And I love you, and I always will.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.509
You know all the times
I wanted to hear that

18:13.509 --> 18:17.554
and now it doesn't
change anything. Ooh!

18:17.554 --> 18:19.556
- You guys making out?
- No.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.393
- Do we have any pop tarts?
- No, we haven't.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.915
Guys?

18:45.415 --> 18:46.750
Oh!

18:48.043 --> 18:51.922
Guys, I don't think I'm bi anymore.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.263
Hey, can we not talk about
this, guys? It's embarrassing.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.140
Why did you have to tell
everybody, asshole?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.475
It's not my fault, asshole.
It's your fault.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.977
You went out of bounds, all right.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.228
Banging some chick, that's fine,

19:06.228 --> 19:07.604
but bang a brother-sister combo,

19:07.604 --> 19:09.773
I am required by law to share that.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.233
- By law.
- Geneva Convention.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.152
- Absolutely.
- Go ahead. Bust my balls.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.987
I'd love to,
I don't know where they've been.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.864
Yeah, it's funny.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.866
I'm transferring out.
I don't give a shit.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.576
You're not transferring out, asshole.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.077
Yes, I am, asshole.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.829
Who you calling asshole, asshole?

19:23.829 --> 19:27.666
All right. Can we stop with the mad libs
here for a minute, okay?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.001
Asshole.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.045
Hey, I would like to say
something in the lad's defense if I could.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.714
- Oh, boy.
- Good-bye.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
No, Mike, stay. Okay?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.427
I want to defend your right
to bang Hansel and Gretel

19:38.427 --> 19:40.345
and not be judged
too harshly by your peers.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.972
It was Sarah and Greg.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.140
Yeah, I'll press on.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.394
What's with the double
standard, gentlemen?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.189
I mean, a chick bangs guys
and decides all of a sudden

19:50.189 --> 19:52.441
she wants, you know, to have
a lesbian experience,

19:52.441 --> 19:53.942
should she be pissed on for that?

19:53.942 --> 19:57.863
Wait a second, it's a lesbian thing when
a chick gets pissed on? Ooh, that's hot.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.407
Yeah, look, that's not what
I'm talking about, dipshit.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.451
- What I'm saying...
- Think about it.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.370
- Actually, it's a little hot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.122
Let me think about that
for a minute.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.790
I don't think it's hot at all. Okay?

20:08.790 --> 20:12.044
But we don't judge women
when they experiment sexually.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.046
- No, we encourage it.
- Sure we do.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.548
But if a guy decides he wants
to change things up a little bit,

20:16.548 --> 20:17.799
change his stripes a little bit,

20:17.799 --> 20:20.135
I mean, all of a sudden
he becomes an object of ridicule,

20:20.135 --> 20:22.262
which, y'know, you do really well, Mike.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.347
Thanks.

20:23.347 --> 20:27.267
And in conclusion, gentlemen,
I say we should not bust Michael's balls,

20:27.267 --> 20:29.061
we should applaud Michael's balls

20:29.061 --> 20:32.689
for having the courage to lead the charge
against this terrible injustice.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.024
What you're saying, by that logic,

20:34.024 --> 20:35.442
we should all be able to bang guys?

20:35.442 --> 20:36.652
That's right, yeah.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.278
Hello? Who's actually gonna
want to do that?

20:38.278 --> 20:39.947
Oh, probably just this little queer.

20:41.114 --> 20:44.159
Oh! Mikey.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.496
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

21:15.440 --> 21:17.526
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh. Hey!

21:17.526 --> 21:18.610
Um...

21:19.278 --> 21:22.030
I was just looking
for my overtime forms.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.825
The, you know, the regular chief
just let's me come in, y'know.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.660
- Did you find them?
- Nope.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.663
They must be downstairs
in the kitchen or something.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.290
Are you in here alone?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.793
As far as I know. Yeah. Why?

21:35.043 --> 21:36.044
Just asking.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.296
- Hey, Tom?
- Yeah.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.131
You got to come downstairs.
We got an issue.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.259
- You need to check it out.
- Got an issue, got an issue. Got to go.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.889
Look, I don't ask questions.
All I do is drive.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.434
I picked him up,
he tells me to bring him here.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.811
Somebody needs to give me
$17 plus tip.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.855
Franco, give him some money, will ya?
I'll pay you.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.939
What's going on?

21:55.939 --> 21:59.443
Cab driver found him down the street
from the hospital.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.278
How about taking him
back to the hospital?

22:01.278 --> 22:03.613
It's New York. There's a guy
in a hospital gown on every corner.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.325
Chief, what are you doing?

22:06.533 --> 22:09.536
- I'm back, Tom.
- Well, you're not supposed to be back.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.621
Does your son
know you're here?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.165
No.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.208
Put him in the suburban.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.044
No, I don't want to-- Come on.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.712
Jerry, you got to get back
to the hospital.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.881
No, I belong here with you guys.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.799
This is where I belong. Just here.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.301
I belong here with you.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.469
- Let's go.
- Come on.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.012
It will be all right.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.269
- Don't let me end up like that, huh?
- Like what?

22:34.519 --> 22:37.189
That guy who doesn't know
when it's time to walk away.

22:37.564 --> 22:41.026
Oh, he can walk away. It's just,
he just needs a little help doing it.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.843
So she must be down here, right?

23:06.843 --> 23:08.887
I mean, they call all boats she, right?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.680
That's right, Kenny.
They're called shes.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.725
That's 'cause they're such filthy whores
to keep up.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.019
I hope you don't mind that kind
of joke and it's boat humor.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.771
I get it. Very comical.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.399
Maybe we can keep the bad language
down to a minimum, Mikey.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.691
My friend happens to be a nun.

23:21.691 --> 23:25.278
Oh, that's one habit I wouldn't mind
keeping up.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.364
Let me show you this, sweetheart.
Come here.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.825
Goddamn cousins.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.577
Finally get a chance to feast
your eyes on the old Barbie Anne.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.162
Barbie Anne, nice name.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.832
Barbie was my first wife.
Anne was my second.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.501
I'd get married again but I can't fit
another name on the boat.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.337
Jesus!

23:42.629 --> 23:44.381
- What's the matter?
- Is this thing moving?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.591
What do you think?
It's connected to the docks.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.677
The docks are floating on the water.
Do the math.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.761
Is the water moving?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.264
It's been known to. Come on, Ken.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.057
Cut it the hell out! You're doing it.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.642
- What?
- You're making it move.

23:55.642 --> 23:59.187
Just stop it, all right?
I got to get my bearings here. Okay?

23:59.312 --> 24:01.314
- Fine.
- Oh, shit!

24:01.314 --> 24:02.524
Oh!

24:04.359 --> 24:05.694
Oh, shit!

24:06.361 --> 24:07.446
You all right?

24:08.029 --> 24:09.197
Yeah, yeah.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.574
I'm good.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.617
Oh, God.

24:13.660 --> 24:18.457
Whoo! Nellie, that was fantastic. Yeah?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.916
Yeah, you think?

24:21.334 --> 24:22.461
What, it was no good?

24:22.919 --> 24:24.045
No, it was fine.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.133
- Fine, just fine?
- Fine is okay.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.385
Jesus, Maggie, we've been
married three days.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.554
Already the sex has gone
down the shitter?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.139
It was better at work.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.682
What?

24:35.682 --> 24:38.602
Y'know, like at the firehouse
when you did me on that guy's table?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.312
That was amazing.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.272
Except the chief walked in on us
and there was that

24:42.397 --> 24:45.358
pen and pencil thing that was poking me
in the thigh the whole time.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.319
No, but that's what
made it so steamy.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.030
The pen and pencil set.
That it was so wrong and all.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.032
Know what?
Let's take a walk over there,

24:52.032 --> 24:53.909
maybe like clean out your locker
or something.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.035
Maggie, I'm not on duty.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.579
Plus, there's a whole another
crew of guys over there right now.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.748
Strangers. Hot.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.251
Actually, you know what? It's against
regulation to have women in the firehouse

25:03.251 --> 25:06.505
and it's definitely against regulation
to bang them there.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.923
Even if they're your wife?

25:08.590 --> 25:11.593
Um, I don't know. I might have to look
at the manual again

25:11.593 --> 25:13.011
but I'm pretty sure no.

25:13.011 --> 25:17.849
I don't know, Sean. I just got to thinking
about the desk and it creaking.

25:18.391 --> 25:21.061
And the papers falling on the floor.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.482
And the feeling of that blotter
on my cool bare ass.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.276
Maybe they're out on a call.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.403
- Let's go.
- Okay. I hope not.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.031
Ken, stay up there much longer,
we're gonna lose the light.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.368
I'm good. I'm fine. Just give me a minute.
I think I got it, all right?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.078
Good, 'cause the boat's
over in the water.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.204
I can't bring it down to you.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.789
Yeah. I know that, Mike. Okay.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.666
- That's good. I'm good.
- You okay?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.209
- All right?
- All right.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.378
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.964
- You okay?
- I got it. I got it.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.715
Wait. I got it. I got a plan.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.385
- Stay steady.
- I got a plan, all right?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.387
- Yeah?
- I got a plan, yeah.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.640
That's better.
That's better.

25:58.640 --> 26:04.354
Where the hell did he come from?
Jesus Christ!

26:08.358 --> 26:09.359
Can I help you?

26:09.526 --> 26:12.279
Um, yeah, I was just wondering
where you might go

26:12.279 --> 26:14.281
if you were thinking of
putting your papers in.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.865
You're putting your papers in?

26:17.033 --> 26:19.619
No, he's a friend of mine
and he's thinking about maybe, y'know,

26:19.619 --> 26:22.122
doing it some years from now.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.331
So I was just...

26:23.665 --> 26:25.834
Well, some years from now,
I couldn't tell you.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.336
But today it's on the second floor,
second window down the hall.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.922
Oh, right. Thanks.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.176
Prick.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.263
I tanked.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.140
It was a total crash and burn.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.766
You don't know that.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.853
Didn't you tell me it takes a couple
of months to find out how you did?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.354
I didn't finish, Nat.

26:47.772 --> 26:51.067
I was doing okay, y'know,
an hour left.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.029
I just put my pencil down,
you know, I stopped.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.823
I could have finished. I didn't want to.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.199
Why not?

26:58.950 --> 27:01.077
I was only taking the thing
for one reason.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.079
Y'know, for my kid
and now she's gone.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.040
What's the point?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.667
I failed her, I failed the test.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.295
I'm batting a thousand.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.881
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.259
Thanks for the comfort.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.136
You don't need comfort.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.722
You need a big ole slap upside
your head.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.682
Be honest with yourself.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.810
You could have gotten Keela
back if you wanted to but you didn't.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.729
She's better off.

27:27.854 --> 27:31.650
But the truth is you didn't
want her enough. Did you?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.944
I wasn't ready to be a father, okay?
What do you want from me? I tried.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.279
I'm sure you did.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.572
And she is better off.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.160
It's just I keep thinking about her.

27:42.869 --> 27:43.870
I don't know why.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.667
Maybe because you always knew
you didn't want her.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.754
Maybe now you're worried she knew, too.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.758
I got to see her.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.387
Call Alicia. Set it up.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.266
Come on.
I'll take you for a coffee, loser.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.479
- Y'know you should have taken that test.
- Yeah, why's that?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.981
You're a hell of a lot smarter than I am.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.824
Tommy Gavin, you cock knocker.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.910
Get your skinny Irish ass
the hell out of my sight.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.412
How you doing?

28:25.412 --> 28:28.331
Tell me that wasn't your kid brother
in the news last week, was it?

28:28.331 --> 28:29.582
Yeah, it was.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.169
Shit. That's a tragedy.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.088
Everybody doing okay?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.382
Y'know best that can be expected.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.843
When did you start working here?

28:39.843 --> 28:43.430
Ah. Six months ago.
Big fire. Spanish Harlem.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.474
Trying to get some nine-foot tall spic
out of his apartment.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.268
Slams the goddamn door on my hand.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.312
I can't bend these two fingers
so they gave me a choice.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.231
Desk job or retirement.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.900
Yeah,
I'm going to retire like some fag.

28:56.693 --> 28:57.944
What are you doing down here?

28:57.944 --> 29:02.157
Me, I was just checking
some pension bullshit downstairs

29:02.157 --> 29:05.452
and now I'm just looking
for the can actually.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.412
Can's that way.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.749
Pension department must have moved
because it was upstairs about an hour ago.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.250
Okay.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.670
- Get your head out of your ass, scout.
- All right, pal. See ya.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.592
Yeah?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.343
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

29:23.094 --> 29:26.306
<i>Are you excited for tomorrow night?
First night of your great new life.</i>

29:26.306 --> 29:30.727
Yeah. Well, you better be
because it's gonna be fabulous.

29:30.852 --> 29:35.190
I got everything. I got linens and pots
and pans and dishes and silverware

29:35.190 --> 29:37.984
and I got a couch
and a massive television coming.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.944
They're all gonna be delivered today
or tomorrow.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.529
I got these really gorgeous pasta bowls

29:41.529 --> 29:43.782
'cause that's what I'm gonna make
for dinner tomorrow

29:43.782 --> 29:45.867
because, y'know, it's the beach.
Keep it simple.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.370
Did you put in your paper?

29:49.370 --> 29:50.830
Guess where I am right now?

29:51.122 --> 29:52.165
I don't know.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.459
I'm down at headquarters.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.170
I'm so happy.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.673
Oh, my, I got to go because
I got to wait for the doorbell

30:00.673 --> 30:02.467
because they're going to
deliver something.

30:02.467 --> 30:06.012
The couch or the table or the TV
or the something. I don't know.

30:07.722 --> 30:11.059
You know, I can't believe it.
I'm here and I can't believe it.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.311
It's gonna be our big future together.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.439
I love you. Bye!

30:27.742 --> 30:29.077
Hey, baby.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.247
Daddy! Daddy, I missed you.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.374
Oh, I missed you, too, honey.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.376
Wow! Look at you. You look incredible.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.127
Check out these new clothes, huh?

30:38.127 --> 30:39.712
Mommy bought them for me.

30:39.712 --> 30:40.880
Mommy, huh?

30:41.464 --> 30:42.590
So where is Alicia?

30:42.590 --> 30:45.635
Upstairs finishing an important call.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.596
Yeah? Who are you?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.807
This is Donald. He's my nanny.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.809
He looks like more of a manny.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.602
Not funny, brother.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.897
Miss Keela has to travel in about ten.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.651
I'll step over there and give you a moment
but I'm watching.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.363
Donald, take Muffin.

31:05.488 --> 31:08.157
Yeah. Take Muffin, Donald.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.119
Yes, Miss Keela.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.455
Miss Keela, huh?

31:14.622 --> 31:15.957
It's silly.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.295
So, baby...

31:21.921 --> 31:23.756
I just can't get over you
looking so pretty.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.467
- You look pretty, too.
- Oh, yeah?

31:26.593 --> 31:27.969
I try, baby. I try.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.974
So, I hope you're not, um--

31:36.394 --> 31:38.229
I wanted you to stay with me, angel.

31:38.771 --> 31:42.233
I did and maybe
when you're older, I can explain,

31:42.233 --> 31:45.904
but it's just-- It got complicated

31:45.904 --> 31:49.699
because of a lot of stuff and, um...

31:51.701 --> 31:52.744
God, I'm sorry.

31:53.286 --> 31:56.664
I'm sorry that
I wasn't the best daddy ever.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.167
Are you hearing me?

32:00.001 --> 32:02.754
Mommy says I have to eat vegetables
and drink milk.

32:03.546 --> 32:04.923
And I don't want to.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.883
So sometimes I don't finish.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.260
She says do the best you can

32:09.260 --> 32:12.513
and when I do that,
she still loves me the same.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.933
You did your best, right?

32:17.852 --> 32:18.937
Yeah.

32:20.521 --> 32:24.025
The car's here, Miss Keela.
Mommy says we mustn't miss our flight.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.527
- Where you going?
- School.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.862
School? Where?

32:27.862 --> 32:31.491
L'ecole de St. Andres,
one of the best girl schools in Europe.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.202
That's in France.
That's near Paris, Daddy.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.746
France? Well, wait a second.
Why didn't Alicia tell me?

32:36.746 --> 32:38.247
Baby, when am I gonna see you again?

32:38.247 --> 32:39.499
I'll come back.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.334
- Are you sure?
- I'll do the best I can.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.543
I love you, Daddy.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.504
I love you, too, angel.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.594
Y'know, if I hear anything, I'll put
my transfer in by the end of the day.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.721
You're not transferring
anywhere, douche bag.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.807
- Who's going where?
- Nobody's going anywhere.

32:56.557 --> 33:00.269
Hey, Franco, or should I say lieutenant
of the future, how did the test go?

33:00.395 --> 33:03.314
- Tell us you nailed it.
- Yeah. Y'know, I did all right.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.399
Not a home run or anything,

33:04.399 --> 33:07.402
but I think I should be getting some
good news in a couple of months.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.987
- They grow up so fast.
- Yeah.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.405
How about you? How was the boat?

33:10.405 --> 33:11.698
I forgot to ask about the boat.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.032
Yeah, well, that surprises me

33:13.032 --> 33:15.618
because, y'know, you've been
so strongly behind the idea.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.786
It was great. It was amazing.

33:16.786 --> 33:20.039
I mean, the water, the air, the sunshine,

33:20.039 --> 33:23.459
it really cleared things up for me,
y' know, in my mind.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.253
I think it's the right move for me.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.713
So you're gonna do it then? When?

33:26.713 --> 33:28.965
I'm kinda working around
Theresa's schedule right now

33:28.965 --> 33:30.800
I think it might be sooner
than everyone thinks.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.926
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.345
I think you might be the only one
here before long, pal.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.806
- Hey, who's Theresa?
- Interesting story.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.309
Oh, boy. Shit!

33:40.309 --> 33:42.228
Bet you it's that headline
I heard riding in.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.022
Yeah.
Fire over in Staten Island.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.607
Every company in lower Manhattan
out there. What's the word?

33:46.733 --> 33:49.569
We're getting relocated. They want us
to cover Fritzy Weiss' house

33:49.569 --> 33:50.820
down near Battery Park.

33:50.945 --> 33:54.615
Goddamn! All right, boys. We've been
relocated downtown for the day.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.410
I need you to get changed.
Get your gear. Get on the rig. All right?

33:57.410 --> 33:59.120
Frank, go find Garrity for me, please?

33:59.120 --> 34:00.496
Move, move, move!

34:00.496 --> 34:02.874
- Garrity!
- Yeah?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.333
Yo, man, what the hell are
you doing?

34:04.333 --> 34:06.586
What? I'm just taking
a shower.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.047
Okay, well, we haven't
been out on a call yet.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.633
Yeah, I know, I had a breakfast burrito
this morning.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.552
It was messy. It was really messy.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.220
Look, dry your ass off and get moving.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.930
We've been relocated downtown
for the day.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.432
Okay. Yeah, just give me two seconds.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.892
- Okay, yeah, hurry up.
- Okay, bye.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.310
Why'd you say two seconds?

34:22.310 --> 34:23.561
It's gonna take longer.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.605
Maggie, just use
a little more soap, okay?

34:25.605 --> 34:28.149
- It will be over before you know it.
- Oy!

34:28.566 --> 34:31.652
The next time you guys get your shit
together, we'll send out announcements.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.529
Have a big goddamn party.

34:34.363 --> 34:36.282
Turn her around, Nils,
we're going back home.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.993
- What happened?
- Turns out they don't need us anyway.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.537
All right, y'know what, Nils?
Take a left up here.

34:41.537 --> 34:42.747
Let's go over a couple blocks.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.040
I wanna show you guys something.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.291
- What?
- You'll see.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.882
Hey, there's Jimmy's name
and Bobby's.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.009
Dennis Sternberg.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.637
Vincent Giamono...

34:59.430 --> 35:01.099
Jimmy Richy's kid.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.145
Hard to believe it's been five years, man.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.731
I saw a thing about this
in <i>The Times.</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:11.400
Picture didn't do it justice.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.612
You realize the only reason
this is here is because

35:14.612 --> 35:17.949
firefighters and regular people,
they wanted to honor the guys we've lost.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.784
There were no politicians involved.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.868
No.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.539
Chief of the Department that day,
when they did the unveiling,

35:25.206 --> 35:27.375
in the speech
he said about the politicians,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.545
all we got was empty promises
from empty suits.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.006
Y'know, I feel for those
families over there.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.300
Waiting for a memorial
for their loved ones.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.178
We already got ours.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.224
Y'know, the guys from this house,
they lost a lot of brothers that day.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.851
They wrote on the back of this thing.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.813
They put personal prayers,
personal notes, and remembrances

35:48.813 --> 35:50.398
to all the brothers they lost that day

35:50.398 --> 35:54.402
and then they sealed it up so nobody
will ever be able to read what they wrote.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.779
It's the way it should be.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.156
Stays between brothers.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.117
Each other is all we got, right?

36:02.243 --> 36:03.661
The boat was a disaster.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.957
Turns out I don't have what
you call sea legs exactly.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.792
I couldn't even stay on the dock.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.379
Looks like you guys are stuck
with me for another couple years.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.965
Well, since we're doing
some truth telling,

36:16.716 --> 36:18.676
I took the goddamn pipe on that exam.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.303
Didn't even finish half of it.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.181
Looks like I won't be going anywhere
anytime soon either, fellas.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.850
I don't care about you guys.
I'm transferring out.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.187
I'm going to a house where I get
some respect and be treated as an equal.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.564
Mikey, you're not transferring out.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.067
I know.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.153
All right. Church is over, kids.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.323
Everybody back on the truck.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.867
Maybe I'll buy us some ice cream
on the way home.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.275
Oh, God. This smells so good!

37:16.275 --> 37:17.860
- Yeah.
- But it's really hot, huh?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.320
Maybe I should have made a salad.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.488
No, no. This is--

37:20.488 --> 37:23.908
I don't know. I love this kitchen.
It is so cozy and so cute.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.368
- Cool.
- Oh, I forgot the parmesan.

37:25.368 --> 37:28.996
- You sit. You start. You start.
- We don't-- Okay.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.418
Look at this. Ten steps from the beach.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.003
We're gonna swim, we're gonna snorkel.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.296
We're gonna do the thing--

37:37.296 --> 37:39.924
What's the thing where you stand
on the surfboard with the sail and--

37:39.924 --> 37:42.718
- Wind surfing.
- No, but we're gonna do that, too.

37:43.177 --> 37:45.054
- Tommy, this--
- Yeah.

37:45.179 --> 37:49.058
This is the smartest thing
you ever did other than Rachel Klein.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.935
I never slept with Rachel Klein.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.478
- You told me you did.
- No, no.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.397
It was a bullshit thing.
I slept with her cousin.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.815
The midget?

37:55.815 --> 37:59.193
She wasn't a midget. Okay?
She's 5'2". 5'2".

37:59.193 --> 38:02.863
- Okay. Number one, blow me.
- What? Yeah?

38:02.863 --> 38:03.948
- Number two.
- What?

38:03.948 --> 38:07.201
This officially makes this
the smartest thing you ever did.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.497
Oh, smell that air.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.834
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- That is the salt from the ocean.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.169
Most people like it but
I'm still trying to figure out if I do.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.462
Yeah.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.214
Good thing it's not pepper, right?

38:20.214 --> 38:21.465
Yeah.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.803
So, I was thinking a couple of things
like that Jacuzzi over there.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.263
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna keep that because

38:27.263 --> 38:28.848
I think we'd have a lot of fun in it.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.891
Then the bar and the grill

38:30.891 --> 38:32.685
and some of that, I may rip that out.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.894
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.771
- Then this tiki thing.
- This has got to go.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.857
No, no. I want to keep this
with the thing

38:37.857 --> 38:41.402
and the fan with the leaves
and these torch things--

38:41.402 --> 38:43.779
I don't really know what
they do but I think they look cool.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.407
They're for bugs.
I think they're for bugs.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.825
- Right? Cool.
- Yeah.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.790
So I, uh...

38:58.169 --> 38:59.503
I didn't put my papers in.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.964
What?

39:13.142 --> 39:14.602
I didn't put my papers in.

39:15.603 --> 39:16.604
Hmm?

39:18.981 --> 39:22.026
The boat thing didn't work out for Lou.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.611
He's staying.

39:23.944 --> 39:27.615
Franco screwed up
on the lieutenant's exam.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.617
Things-- Things changed.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.619
Things stayed the same
but they changed,

39:31.619 --> 39:35.247
so I just feel like I need
to be there for the guys.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.594
You don't need to work.
You don't got to stay.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.015
Oh, Jesus Christ!

39:54.975 --> 39:55.976
What?

39:57.728 --> 39:59.647
Can you take off your sunglasses?

40:06.946 --> 40:09.865
Were you were at least planning
on spending the night with me here?

40:17.873 --> 40:20.000
I needs me a glass of wine.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.547
- Want me to refresh your drink?
- Yes.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.044
What's a matter?

41:05.754 --> 41:06.922
A little flat.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.897
Want to go watch <i>Meerkat Manor?</i>

41:26.609 --> 41:27.651
Yeah.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.088
<i>We headed out right away.</i>

41:48.214 --> 41:50.049
<i>Wanted to get a good jump on these fish.</i>

42:04.813 --> 42:05.940
Asshole!

42:14.990 --> 42:17.493
He must think I am a fool.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.665
You think that I bought all
this for me?

42:24.375 --> 42:27.378
I bought this for us.
You think I wanted this?

42:27.586 --> 42:29.338
What? You think that I wanted that?

42:30.798 --> 42:35.302
You think that-- You think I picked
this piece of shit out for myself?

42:35.469 --> 42:38.556
Huh? Is that what you think,
you son of a bitch?

42:54.822 --> 42:55.864
Shit!

42:57.324 --> 42:58.909
Tommy!
Tommy!

42:58.909 --> 43:02.079
Wake up. Please, Tommy!
Wake up! Wake up! Aah!

43:48.459 --> 43:50.377

43:50.377 --> 43:51.587
There's a--

43:52.421 --> 43:53.422
There's a fire...

43:53.422 --> 43:55.549
<i>A fire at what address, ma'am?</i>

43:55.549 --> 43:57.676
<i>Address?</i>

43:58.052 --> 44:01.055
Ah, 15, Seaview Avenue.
And there's a fire.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.307
<i>Ma'am? Is it 15 Seaview Avenue?</i>

44:30.334 --> 44:32.419
