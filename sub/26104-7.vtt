WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.671
FELIPE: Previously
on Mayans M.C....

00:03.704 --> 00:05.239
I'm your grandmother, kid.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.874
Do the bastard math.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.042
You see this?

00:08.076 --> 00:09.810
She stole the fucking car
from Grandma.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.545
P.D.'s looking for a felon.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.314
Of course she did.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.050
(suspenseful music)

00:16.084 --> 00:17.218
JIMENEZ: Your partner?

00:17.251 --> 00:18.886
FELIPE: Pedro the Thorn.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.754
-He make it out?
-I don't know.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.756
Don't know if he wanted
to get out.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.393
If you don't trust me by now,
Adelita, you never will.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.095
I need to know everything.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.667
GALINDO: Prep the money.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.769
MAN: I understand
this is inconvenient,

00:35.803 --> 00:37.205
but we need to check that baby.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.508
*

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
-(baby fussing)
-Mr. Galindo,

00:42.276 --> 00:43.944
don't make this worse
than it is.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.214
BISHOP: We'll keep
Angel and Coco close

00:46.247 --> 00:48.382
a couple more weeks.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.018
Prove to Alvarez there's no
fucking mole at our table.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.953
Bishop thinks Coco's
the fucking mole.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.522
That's why he's been
separating us.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.689
Where's Coco now?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.891
*

01:03.331 --> 01:06.334
(distant pop music playing
over radio)

01:23.184 --> 01:30.090
*

01:38.532 --> 01:42.002
Alvarez say why the family
was at the Calexico checkpoint?

01:42.035 --> 01:44.004
BISHOP: All Devante told him
was that Galindo got pulled

01:44.037 --> 01:46.407
into a back room
by Border Patrol.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.075
No one's telling him shit.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.043
-Feds?
-Feels like it.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.650
(door closes)

01:58.486 --> 02:01.555
Sorry, I was hoping
I'd get a minute.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.698
I got to tell you something.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.468
What's going on?

02:19.006 --> 02:20.408
It's, uh...

02:23.977 --> 02:26.780
It's fucking tricky.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.182
Now, I don't want to...

02:29.983 --> 02:31.785
You know, if I--

02:31.819 --> 02:34.188
Telling you this makes me feel
like a snitch.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.023
With all the shit going on,

02:36.056 --> 02:37.991
if I don't say something,
then I...

02:38.025 --> 02:40.694
Fucking say it, Angel.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.065
(sighs, clears throat)

02:45.098 --> 02:47.501
Last week, at the Reed ranch,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.637
we went after Dennis

02:49.670 --> 02:52.306
and chased him onto Riz's land.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.509
About 50 yards in,
we hit soft earth.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.010
Gilly dropped into a hole.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.880
That's why we lost Dennis.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.685
What kind of hole?

03:05.919 --> 03:08.088
We thought it was a fox den
or a sinkhole at first,

03:08.121 --> 03:11.091
but we checked it out
a few days later.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.060
It was an old tunnel.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.363
Abandoned.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.831
But it led to another tunnel,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.533
an active one.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.168
Working lights.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.571
Fresh prints.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.374
A tunnel to where?

03:26.407 --> 03:29.510
Southern end led
to a locked hatch

03:29.543 --> 03:31.812
about a half mile into Mexico.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.283
The other end led
to a storm cellar...

03:36.950 --> 03:38.886
At the Ariza house.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.722
Vicki's place.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.195
Bishop, I'm sorry
we didn't--

03:48.228 --> 03:49.763
I'm sorry we didn't tell you
about this right away.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.064
You know, we were just trying
to figure out

03:51.098 --> 03:52.600
the right thing to do.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.268
The shit spinning
with the rebels,

03:54.302 --> 03:57.471
Galindo worrying
about a mole...

03:57.505 --> 03:59.940
we knew this could throw
a lot of heat at Riz.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.181
You did the right thing.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.919
We'll figure it out.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.622
For now...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.824
we should just keep it
in this room.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.933
Yeah.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.801
Okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.679
(Mexican rock music)

04:38.712 --> 04:41.682
(man singing in Spanish)

04:41.715 --> 04:48.622
*

04:50.324 --> 04:53.293
(cell phone vibrating)

04:53.327 --> 05:00.200
*

05:04.338 --> 05:07.307
(song continues
over radio)

05:07.341 --> 05:11.445
*

05:11.479 --> 05:13.947
(knocking on door)

05:13.981 --> 05:15.449
*

05:15.483 --> 05:17.785
Need you, prospect.
Warehouse.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.120
*

05:20.153 --> 05:21.555
(door closes)

05:21.589 --> 05:24.558
(song continues)

05:24.592 --> 05:31.499
*

05:58.291 --> 06:00.227
Thank you, Ezekiel.

06:00.260 --> 06:07.134
*

06:35.395 --> 06:37.197
(Galindo scoffs)

06:37.230 --> 06:44.104
*

06:45.005 --> 06:48.241
*

07:01.489 --> 07:03.491
We're in America.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.626
We should speak English.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.768
Do you have other siblings?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.136
ANGEL: No.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.071
After the two of us,
my folks knew

07:18.105 --> 07:20.173
they reached perfection.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.742
(chuckles)

07:21.775 --> 07:23.544
(both laughing)

07:24.211 --> 07:26.780
How long since
your mother passed?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.450
Almost nine years.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.289
Your father didn't remarry?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.527
For him...

07:42.329 --> 07:44.197
She's still very much there.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.268
Literally.
In a jar.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.837
It's...

07:49.870 --> 07:51.505
it's creepy as fuck.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.540
(laughs)

07:55.475 --> 07:57.678
He likes talking to her.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.787
Pull over.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.255
On the left.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.998
(cicadas buzzing)

08:34.047 --> 08:36.183
What's she doing
on this side?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.158
Let's find Coco and Gilly.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.627
I'll tell you what I know.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.634
(engine turns over)

09:01.308 --> 09:04.277
(dramatic music)

09:04.311 --> 09:11.218
*

09:12.385 --> 09:15.522
* Mother of exiles

09:15.555 --> 09:17.591
* The torch of hope

09:17.625 --> 09:20.360
* In the toss of the tempest

09:20.393 --> 09:23.230
* Threw us medicine's rope

09:23.263 --> 09:26.533
* But the brazen giant

09:26.566 --> 09:28.301
* With limbs astride

09:28.335 --> 09:31.471
* Blocks the golden door

09:31.504 --> 09:34.107
* To the US of lies

09:34.141 --> 09:35.575
* Screaming

09:35.609 --> 09:39.412
* Damn your huddled masses

09:39.446 --> 09:42.549
* Scrub our floors

09:42.582 --> 09:44.952
* Cut our grasses

09:44.985 --> 09:47.554
* I am a wolf

09:47.587 --> 09:50.290
* A wild cur

09:50.323 --> 09:53.761
* Cut from the pack

09:53.794 --> 09:56.263
* With blood on my fur

09:56.296 --> 09:58.966
* Every howl

09:58.999 --> 10:01.669
* Marks the dead

10:01.702 --> 10:05.272
* 'Cause a beaten dog

10:05.305 --> 10:06.907
*

10:06.940 --> 10:08.776
* Never forgets

10:08.809 --> 10:12.112
*

10:12.145 --> 10:14.514
* Never forgets

10:14.547 --> 10:21.454
*

10:28.796 --> 10:31.164
Shit, that all
goes down today?

10:31.198 --> 10:32.632
-Yeah.
-How long the rebels been

10:32.666 --> 10:34.167
planning all that?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.436
(door opens)

10:36.469 --> 10:37.938
RIZ: Morning, brothers.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.506
Bikes are in the pit, prospect.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.913
(sighs)

10:51.251 --> 10:54.187
I got to bounce
something else off you guys.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.523
Templo.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.695
(sighs)

11:17.277 --> 11:20.247
-She's very hungry.
-Yeah, she is.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.551
-What are you doing here?
-Coco told me to come by.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.153
Not sure why.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.255
Had Captain Handjob
pick me up.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.157
I'm gonna make her
some breakfast.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.425
Eggs sunny-side, toast,

11:32.459 --> 11:35.228
lots of butter,
and magic huckleberry jam.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.297
(chuckles)
Yeah.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.770
BISHOP: Alvarez
is on his way down.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.538
Hopefully we'll know more
by the time he rolls in.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.508
But Galindo's a dual citizen.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.610
They're not just gonna hold him
for no reason.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.113
Why the fuck aren't his lawyers
crawling up their ass?

11:53.146 --> 11:55.282
Maybe they can't find
the right ass.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.051
(all chuckle)

11:58.085 --> 11:59.887
-We still making the run?
TAZ: Yeah.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.756
Business as usual.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.458
Maybe we should keep
some manpower here,

12:05.492 --> 12:08.061
in case we hear from Galindo.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.697
Makes sense.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.232
Riz.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.267
Why don't you hang here?

12:14.301 --> 12:16.136
Yeah.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.006
(smacks lips)
Okay.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.650
(upbeat pop music playing

12:30.683 --> 12:35.322

12:35.355 --> 12:37.290
Hey, bro.

(indistinct chatter)

12:40.460 --> 12:47.300
*

12:47.334 --> 12:49.002
My brothers...

12:50.537 --> 12:51.805
Want you to meet Letty.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.109
-She's my kid.
-Whoa.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.146
RIZ: (laughs) Riz.
LETICIA: Hi.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.815
RIZ: Nice to meet you.
LETICIA: You too.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.818
TAZA: Hey, I'm Taza.
Nice to meet you.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.154
Chucky.
The girl.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.989
Yes, that's the one.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.791
It's his daughter.
She likes my jam.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.800
I didn't know
you had another kid.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.937
Yeah, well, I fucked up
things pretty bad with her.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.505
I'm trying to fix that.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.517
Let him spend the day
with his kid.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.688
-Hey.
-Yeah?

13:41.721 --> 13:44.324
Hang with your kid.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.059
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
Welcome.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.733
Hey, prospect.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.035
You're with us.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.904
Reaper run.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.872
Okay.

13:58.906 --> 14:05.778

14:57.664 --> 15:00.433
Was this her favorite jar?

Who the fuck are you?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.476

15:09.509 --> 15:11.611
I'm just a girl.

Ignacio.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.415
*

15:15.448 --> 15:18.285
A girl who also lives
with ghosts.

15:18.318 --> 15:22.722
*

15:22.755 --> 15:24.124
Sit.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.806
We have a lot in common.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.242
*

15:42.275 --> 15:44.978
Where'd you get this?

15:45.012 --> 15:47.814
My father.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.916
It was in a box...

15:49.949 --> 15:52.852
hidden inside a heating vent.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.289
The same vent where I watched
the cartel

15:56.323 --> 15:59.126
slaughter him, my mother,

15:59.159 --> 16:01.361
and my baby brother.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.331
*

16:04.364 --> 16:05.665
Jesus.

(sighs)

16:09.569 --> 16:13.040
*

16:13.073 --> 16:15.475
You're Pedro's kid.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.111
*

16:18.145 --> 16:21.314
People know me as Adelita.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.050
*

16:23.083 --> 16:24.851
The rebel?

16:24.884 --> 16:26.686
*

16:26.719 --> 16:28.955
How did you find me?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.190
*

16:30.223 --> 16:32.392
Your sons.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.560
*

16:33.593 --> 16:35.862
They're helping our cause.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.730
Jesus.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.466
They know you're here?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.034
No.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.502
*

16:42.535 --> 16:44.971
They don't know
how we are connected.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.839
*

16:46.873 --> 16:49.076
Angel thinks...

16:49.109 --> 16:52.645
meeting me was a random act
of fate.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.314
*

16:54.347 --> 16:56.483
But we know better.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.751
I don't know shit.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.387
*

17:00.420 --> 17:02.389
Just tell me
what the hell you want.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.424
*

17:04.457 --> 17:06.693
My father...

17:06.726 --> 17:08.928
left Mexico in 1988.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.230
*

17:10.263 --> 17:11.998
Fled to Venezuela.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.333
*

17:13.366 --> 17:15.068
New name,

17:15.102 --> 17:17.337
new life.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.207
Met my mother.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.875
After a few years,
I was born.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.446
On the day before
my sixth birthday...

17:26.479 --> 17:29.516
the Galindos' henchmen
kicked down our doors.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.185
*

17:32.219 --> 17:34.587
My mother hid me

17:34.621 --> 17:36.556
in an old heating vent.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.092
*

17:39.126 --> 17:42.462
(voice breaking) She didn't
have time to hide my brother.

17:42.495 --> 17:46.899
*

17:46.933 --> 17:49.102
They made my father watch

17:49.136 --> 17:51.538
as they hacked his wife

17:51.571 --> 17:54.774
and son to pieces.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.977
The man in charge, he gloated.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.448
Said my father was betrayed
by a friend.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.782
*

18:02.815 --> 18:05.452
A sacred trust.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.920
They chopped off his head...

18:07.954 --> 18:09.289
*

18:09.322 --> 18:11.124
And laughed.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.260
*

18:13.293 --> 18:15.795
(softly)
Fuck.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.065
The sacred trust...

18:19.098 --> 18:21.168
of a partner.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.603
*

18:23.636 --> 18:26.439
And you think I sold out
your father.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.940
*

18:27.974 --> 18:30.143
And you're here to kill me.

18:30.177 --> 18:34.781
*

18:34.814 --> 18:37.450
Don't shoot me in the back.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.319
*

18:39.352 --> 18:41.588
There's something
you might want to see.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.790
*

18:43.823 --> 18:45.158
Sit down.

18:45.192 --> 18:49.429
*

18:49.462 --> 18:51.798
What?

18:51.831 --> 18:54.467
The whole picture.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.876
BOWEN: Yep, come on in.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.980
Hey.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.886
KJ.

19:17.590 --> 19:21.294
Look like you might need
a few more sick days.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.495
I'm fine.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.063
EZ delivers a bag today.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.065
I just want to let you know
that I'm gonna--

19:26.098 --> 19:27.400
It's too late.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.202
It's done.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.305
This AUSA--they want Reyes.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.973
What the fuck
are you talking about?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.842
Himler's gonna be
my point man for EZ Reyes

19:35.875 --> 19:38.144
from here on.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.513
You're too close. I'm sending
you back to San Diego.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.848
And what happened to EZ?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.816
I got Himler
to put out a BOLO.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.086
-We're gonna bring Reyes in.
-With local cops?

19:47.119 --> 19:48.588
That shit will expose him.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.090
-The M.C. could--
-This is not my worry.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.926
Right.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.196
Just another dead Mexican.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.504
Probably get a bonus for that
in this administration.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.273
Get the fuck out.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.064
We were animals.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.136
We sold our soul
to the cartel.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.276
This was just another day
on the job.

20:46.846 --> 20:50.450
I can't even remember
their names.

20:52.519 --> 20:56.623
Marisol was pregnant
with Angel.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.425
I was done.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.895
I had to get her out.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.198
Your father was single
and young.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.105
He wasn't ready
to leave the money.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.777
I never knew
what happened to him.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.516
Then...

21:23.550 --> 21:25.952
who else could have known
where he was?

21:27.487 --> 21:30.457
Maybe the one
who took the picture.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.094
We were always together.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.063
Inseparable.

21:39.899 --> 21:43.570
We were just trying to find
a way to fit in.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.606
Rodrigo...

21:46.639 --> 21:48.808
took another path.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.478
He was the only one
that knew where I was.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.716
He helped me create
Felipe Reyes.

22:00.252 --> 22:03.556
He may have done the same
for your father.

22:03.590 --> 22:07.226
The sacred trust...

22:07.259 --> 22:08.895
of a priest.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.132
(coughs)

22:13.165 --> 22:14.867
Do you know the bishop?

22:16.403 --> 22:17.970
(vomits)

22:18.004 --> 22:19.739
(coughing, gasping)

22:19.772 --> 22:22.341
That feels like a "yes."

22:22.375 --> 22:24.544
(coughing)

22:26.078 --> 22:28.247
(sighs)

22:30.717 --> 22:33.653
If you're gonna kill me...

22:33.686 --> 22:37.089
please don't do it here.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.592
I don't want my home to have
the same bad memories

22:39.626 --> 22:41.428
as my shop.

22:44.764 --> 22:51.638
*

22:55.542 --> 22:57.410
ADELITA: May I borrow this?

22:57.444 --> 23:04.316
*

23:09.388 --> 23:10.757
I'm sorry.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.027
So am I.

23:15.061 --> 23:19.766
*

23:19.799 --> 23:22.769
Was my father...

23:22.802 --> 23:24.571
really an animal?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.806
*

23:26.839 --> 23:29.476
We didn't start out that way.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.244
*

23:32.278 --> 23:35.247
We just chose
the wrong family.

23:35.281 --> 23:41.488
*

23:41.521 --> 23:45.792
(door opens, closes)

23:45.825 --> 23:47.827
*

23:51.197 --> 23:54.200
(engines rumbling)

23:58.337 --> 24:00.106
Frankie.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.775
-(men laughing)
-What's up, brother?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.276
-How was your ride?
-It was great, man.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.579
-How are you? How's the family?
-Good.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.814
(cell phone rings)

24:07.847 --> 24:09.015
-How you doing, brother?
-Great.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.917
-Everything good?
-Yeah.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.619
As promised.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.655
(indistinct chatter)

24:18.290 --> 24:20.359
-It's clean.
-Good.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.529
-All right, let's show 'em.
-Right on.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.137
(cell phone rings)

24:40.246 --> 24:42.448
Look at that.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.885
MAN: Look at you guys,
always with the good stuff.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.720
Yeah?

24:47.754 --> 24:49.522
Where are you?

24:49.556 --> 24:51.357
I'm on the road.

24:51.390 --> 24:54.661
-What's up?
-Bowen is pulling our deal.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.296
You're in the wind.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.465
Fuck.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.234
I'm not giving up, EZ.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.537
It's probably done, anyhow.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.409
Galindo was picked up
at the border last night.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.244
Calexico East.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.181
-Not sure who has him.
-Jesus.

25:21.788 --> 25:25.024
Don't cave on me, cuz.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.759
You need to steer clear
of the Mayans.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.494
They put out a BOLO.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.663
I'm not sure how much
the cops know,

25:30.697 --> 25:33.365
but you don't want them talking
about it in front of a patch.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.401
I'll check in
when I know more.

25:35.434 --> 25:36.869
(line clicks)

25:46.979 --> 25:49.982
(engine turns over)

25:56.555 --> 25:59.525
(tense music)

25:59.558 --> 26:03.129
*

26:20.980 --> 26:23.415
(men laughing)

27:09.461 --> 27:12.164
(men shouting)

27:12.198 --> 27:18.905
*

27:23.142 --> 27:25.411
(straining)

27:29.015 --> 27:32.952
(man shouts in Spanish)

27:32.985 --> 27:39.859
*

27:42.394 --> 27:45.064
(spits)

27:45.097 --> 27:47.333
Vamos!

27:47.366 --> 27:50.336
(indistinct chatter)

27:50.369 --> 27:54.673
*

27:59.578 --> 28:03.049
(engines rumbling)

28:20.699 --> 28:23.269
Dispatch, this is California
6-2-5-78.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.038
I have eyes on a possible BOLO.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.174
(tires squealing)

28:28.207 --> 28:30.509
Yeah, I-I got to find
a bigger place, mi'ja.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.012
You know,
it might take a minute, but--

28:33.045 --> 28:35.047
but I promise I'll--

28:35.081 --> 28:36.582
I'm gonna get you out of here.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.169
Oh, isn't this precious.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.777
She needs a key, Mom.

29:04.811 --> 29:07.613
I gave you money
for all that shit.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.220
No wonder she's starving.
I told you to buy some food.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.356
It's been kind of hard
to do anything without a car.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.427
Cops called this morning.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.430
Found my Chevy in a field

29:24.463 --> 29:26.632
near the border...

29:26.665 --> 29:30.436
a dead body
in the fucking trunk!

29:30.469 --> 29:32.972
-Wow, anyone you know?
-Fuck you!

29:33.005 --> 29:35.107
(snickers)

29:35.141 --> 29:36.442
I know she was the one
who took it.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.077
Then why'd you
report it stolen?

29:38.110 --> 29:41.280
To teach you
a goddamn lesson.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.949
So I don't grow up to be
a stupid whore

29:42.982 --> 29:44.817
with dead bodies in my trunk.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.086
-Hmm?
-Mom, come--come on.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.455
I mean, hey, enough.
I'll get you another car.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.923
Oh, no, no, no.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.992
That's not the only thing
you're gonna get me.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.694
All I have to do is tell the
cops it was you that took it.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.763
They'll see your record,

29:57.796 --> 30:01.467
nice little uniform.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.103
How do you think
that's gonna go over?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.005
He didn't take the car--

30:09.075 --> 30:12.811
I'm doing my best
to make this work, Celia.

30:12.845 --> 30:16.448
I-I-I get it,
you--you hate me.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.218
I'm the shit son.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.353
But I need some help.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.323
You got to meet me halfway.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.092
For her sake.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.661
Why should I?

30:31.563 --> 30:33.599
You don't give a shit about me.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.668
You never call.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.504
Never help me out.

30:39.738 --> 30:42.741
Only fucking reason
you're here now...

30:42.774 --> 30:44.343
is 'cause of her.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.178
Hmm?

30:51.918 --> 30:53.752
(door closes)

30:53.785 --> 30:56.655
-Sorry, I-I was just...
-No, it's--it's okay.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.925
Just give her
a lot of room.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.492
-Okay?
-Okay.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.728
Stay out of her way.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.630
I'll check in later, yeah?

31:07.466 --> 31:08.434
(smooches)

31:35.094 --> 31:36.562
(door closes)

31:39.731 --> 31:42.068
He give you money?

31:42.101 --> 31:44.103
Why do you care?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.407
Give it to me.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.442
Crazy fucking bitch!

31:55.447 --> 31:58.117
You think this is gonna last?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.785
Huh?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.488
Papí ain't gonna be around
much longer, mi'ja.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.957
Ain't in his nature.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.659
So, if you want
to keep this coming...

32:07.693 --> 32:09.495
you better get
that tight little twat out

32:09.528 --> 32:11.230
into the street.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.965
Earn your shit!

32:17.636 --> 32:20.606
(sobbing quietly)

32:20.639 --> 32:23.642
(water running)

32:33.352 --> 32:35.454
(knob squeaks, water stops)

32:35.487 --> 32:38.991
(breathing shakily)

32:57.343 --> 32:59.145
MAN: California 6-2-5-78,

32:59.178 --> 33:00.779
I'm approaching
the rendezvous point.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.248
We have open road.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.684
MAN (over radio): 10-4.
Backup is waiting.

out of this.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.817
Don't give them a reason
to search, huh?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.352
(sighs)
Fuck.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.924
GILLY: Easy, prospect.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.993
That him?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.828
Yeah.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.497
(engine turns over)

33:51.530 --> 33:53.065
(engine revving)

33:53.099 --> 33:55.000
EZ.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.402
EZ!

33:56.435 --> 33:58.137
Fuck's he doing?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.274
Get off the bike!

34:02.308 --> 34:03.409
Now! Park it!

34:03.442 --> 34:05.777
You're looking for EZ Reyes.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.679
That's me.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.515
(engine rumbling)

34:09.548 --> 34:11.917
(upbeat rock music)

34:11.950 --> 34:13.419
(both laugh)

34:13.452 --> 34:16.722
-(sirens wailing)
-Ah, shit.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.457
Motherfucker.

34:18.490 --> 34:19.691
*

34:19.725 --> 34:20.892
Listen to Little Willie G...

34:20.926 --> 34:24.062
(speaking indistinctly)

34:24.096 --> 34:26.565
I bet we can save
the whole world.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.933
Listen to me one time.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.436
*

34:30.469 --> 34:32.938
* Everybody

34:32.971 --> 34:35.607
* Needs somebody

34:35.641 --> 34:38.244
* Everybody

34:38.277 --> 34:42.214
* Needs somebody to love

34:42.248 --> 34:44.783
* Somebody to love, now

34:44.816 --> 34:46.618
* Somebody to kiss

34:46.652 --> 34:47.886
(sirens approaching)

34:47.919 --> 34:50.389
* Someone to miss, now

34:50.422 --> 34:53.058
* Someone to please

34:53.091 --> 34:55.127
-(sirens wailing)
-* Someone to tease, now

34:55.161 --> 34:58.630
* And I need you, you, you

34:58.664 --> 35:01.333
* I need you, you, you

35:01.367 --> 35:03.669
* I need you,
you, you *

35:03.702 --> 35:06.138
* I need you, you

35:06.172 --> 35:07.406
(tires screeching)

35:07.439 --> 35:10.609
* Sometimes I feel like

35:10.642 --> 35:12.278
On the ground!

35:12.311 --> 35:13.845
Now!

35:13.879 --> 35:15.747
Off the bike!

35:15.781 --> 35:17.283
On the ground!

35:17.316 --> 35:19.985
Now!

35:20.018 --> 35:22.188
Slowly!

35:22.221 --> 35:24.790
* I need you, you, you

35:24.823 --> 35:26.258
* I need you,
you, you *

35:26.292 --> 35:27.693
-On the ground!
-Aah!

35:27.726 --> 35:29.761
Stop resisting!

35:29.795 --> 35:32.498
* I need you, you, you

35:32.531 --> 35:34.766
Stop fighting!

35:34.800 --> 35:38.970
*

35:43.842 --> 35:47.479
(indistinct chatter,
bell ringing)

36:01.427 --> 36:03.495
-Anything from the lawyer?
-(sighs)

36:03.529 --> 36:05.497
No.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.634
Legal hierarchy
at the border now...

36:08.667 --> 36:12.304
(scoffs)
It's fucking chaos.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.740
Idiots dictating policy.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.676
Making shit up
as they go along.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.711
Covering their ass
so they don't take the hit

36:19.745 --> 36:22.914
when the emperor shits
his new clothes.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.517
Think it's the Feds?

36:25.551 --> 36:27.486
Cisen?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.987
I did.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.589
At first.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.424
But now...

36:32.458 --> 36:34.960
18 hours, no word...

36:37.263 --> 36:39.265
Feds would love to posture.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.800
They couldn't go this long
without swinging their dicks.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.606
Forgive me.

36:49.575 --> 36:53.078
-(sighs)
-(sniffles)

36:53.111 --> 36:56.081
(keypad beeping)

36:56.114 --> 36:57.383
(panel beeps)

36:57.416 --> 36:58.750
Come on, shit.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.854
(door rattling)

37:02.888 --> 37:04.456
(upbeat Hispanic music
playing over radio)

37:04.490 --> 37:06.625
POTTER: Idiot.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.560
Shit.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.728
*

37:09.761 --> 37:11.463
I say if a man
can't be trusted

37:11.497 --> 37:14.266
to remember
five simple digits...

37:14.300 --> 37:15.434
(door rattling)

37:15.467 --> 37:17.303
Let him in.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.138
-(knocking on door)
-Shit.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.473
*

37:21.507 --> 37:22.608
(knocking continues)

37:27.513 --> 37:30.849
POTTER: 9-1-6-1-0.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.087
Agent.

37:36.121 --> 37:40.125
September 16, 1810.

37:40.158 --> 37:43.429
Mexico's cry of independence.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.997
I thought that was
Cinco de Mayo.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.633
(all snickering)

37:47.666 --> 37:50.436
Troglodita.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.103
Any word on Reyes?

37:52.137 --> 37:54.005
-CHP just picked him up.
-Hmm.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.941
(knocking on door)

37:55.974 --> 37:58.410
-Is no one informed?
JIMENEZ: It's Agent Jimenez!

37:58.444 --> 38:01.580
I got some information
you're gonna want to hear!

38:01.613 --> 38:03.782
-Shit.
-(door opens)

38:05.884 --> 38:07.753
What the hell
are you doing here? Huh?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.356
(overlapping speech)

38:10.389 --> 38:12.358
Finally, a little fire.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.395
Agent Kevin Jimenez.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.631
Lincoln Potter.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.433
Agent Jimenez
is off this case

38:21.467 --> 38:24.035
and a heartbeat away
from losing his badge.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.805
-I think he's aware of that.
-I am, sir.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.474
But I've invested
over two years

38:28.507 --> 38:31.009
setting up the investigation
into Galindo.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.012
To pull it from me now
and burn EZ Reyes

38:34.045 --> 38:36.314
is a huge mistake.

38:38.350 --> 38:41.286
That's very passionate
rhetoric, Agent Jimenez, but--

38:41.319 --> 38:43.722
An hour ago, I got intel
from EZ.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.624
He told me Galindo
was being detained

38:45.657 --> 38:47.726
at Calexico East.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.529
He's off the grid.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.863
Not us.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.000
It's--it's probably bullshit.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.405
HIMLER: It's not.
Galindo hasn't pinged

38:59.438 --> 39:00.639
in over 26 hours.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.042
No calls, charges, Internet.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.412
He is off the grid.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.680
Check with your agencies.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.749
See if anyone scooped him up.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.318
Get teams on homes
and businesses.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.687
Let's find him.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.156
What about EZ Reyes?

39:18.189 --> 39:20.091
Until we know more,

39:20.125 --> 39:22.894
we drop the BOLO.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.363
Your deal is still in play.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.932
For now.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.567
Okay.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.236
-Thank you.
-Agent...

39:31.269 --> 39:33.505
(overlapping chatter)

39:33.539 --> 39:35.006
You should get some rest.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.110
Maybe reacquaint yourself
with the practice of hygiene.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.491
(door closes)

39:54.960 --> 39:56.294
(music resumes)

39:56.327 --> 39:59.297
(man singing in Spanish)

39:59.330 --> 40:01.099
*

40:01.132 --> 40:03.502
-(door buzzes)
WOMAN: Galindo.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.008
(handcuffs clicking)

40:11.443 --> 40:13.712
Step up.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.346
Hands on the fence.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.183
Back it up.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.823
(door buzzes in the distance)

40:28.494 --> 40:30.929
Where are you taking me?

40:46.444 --> 40:47.378
(door opens)

40:51.216 --> 40:52.518
(door closes)

40:52.551 --> 40:55.386
-What is this place?
-Just go.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.832
Wait here.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.278
ADELITA: Take off
the restraints.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.281
(dramatic music)

41:23.314 --> 41:30.155
*

41:30.188 --> 41:32.357
(handcuffs clicking)

41:32.390 --> 41:34.292
Thank you.

41:34.325 --> 41:41.199
*

41:51.009 --> 41:53.011
-You know who I am?
-I know.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.846
Where's my son?

41:56.247 --> 41:57.382
Here.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.184
Safe.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.386
Your family, also.

42:01.419 --> 42:02.921
Safe.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.866
If this was just about...

42:14.900 --> 42:17.435
matar al diablo...

42:17.468 --> 42:20.238
I assume I'd already be dead.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.674
-I'm not here to kill you.
-No.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.109
But you're here
to plant drugs on me

42:24.142 --> 42:25.944
and torture my family.

42:30.782 --> 42:33.719
The Galindo Cartel...

42:33.752 --> 42:37.088
slaughtered my mother...

42:37.122 --> 42:39.057
my father...

42:39.090 --> 42:40.592
and my brother.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.262
Hmm.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.798
Is that what this is?

42:46.832 --> 42:49.100
Revenge?

42:49.134 --> 42:50.636
Vengeance...

42:50.669 --> 42:52.170
is just the match.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.240
You know that.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.811
Fire is much more complicated.

43:02.948 --> 43:05.717
-I know you want me dead.
-(chuckles)

43:05.751 --> 43:07.285
Think I'm...

43:07.318 --> 43:08.920
(speaking Spanish)

43:16.027 --> 43:17.528
What do you want?

43:20.365 --> 43:22.533
Cooperation...

43:24.535 --> 43:27.773
You really think I would
cooperate with terrorists?

43:27.806 --> 43:29.808
No more than I'd cooperate

43:29.841 --> 43:31.643
with psychopaths

43:31.677 --> 43:33.311
and nun-killers.

43:39.785 --> 43:42.120
Please, sit.

43:53.699 --> 43:54.700
(phone line ringing)

44:02.573 --> 44:04.475
(typing)

44:07.979 --> 44:09.881
Your poppies...

44:09.915 --> 44:12.183
in the mountains of Guerrero.

44:16.554 --> 44:19.257
Your refinery in Ixtapa.

44:23.729 --> 44:27.032
Your distribution hubs
in Sonora.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.669
Why are you showing me
all this?

44:35.206 --> 44:36.307
Florentino.

44:36.341 --> 44:37.608
MAN (over radio): Florentino.

44:39.911 --> 44:40.912
ADELITA: Cosette.

44:40.946 --> 44:41.913
MAN (over radio): Cosette.

44:41.947 --> 44:44.950
(explosion)

44:47.585 --> 44:49.888
ADELITA: Marius y Fermina.

44:49.921 --> 44:53.058
MAN (over radio):
Marius, Fermina.

44:53.091 --> 44:56.594
(series of explosions)

44:56.627 --> 44:58.696
ADELITA: It's in real time.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.934
Use the phone.

45:02.968 --> 45:04.569
Confirm it if you like.

45:06.237 --> 45:07.739
Hmm.

45:07.773 --> 45:09.374
(fire crackling)

45:09.407 --> 45:13.344
Burning a few fields.
Blowing up some trucks.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.713
You think that matters?

45:15.747 --> 45:18.216
Impacts my business?

45:19.484 --> 45:21.486
-No.
-No.

45:27.793 --> 45:31.629
ADELITA: Each of these
is also a call away.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.965
It's your entire operation.

45:33.999 --> 45:36.034
If they go...

45:36.067 --> 45:38.203
it will matter.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.072
It'll cripple you.

45:41.106 --> 45:44.876
Enough to allow Lobo Sonora

45:44.910 --> 45:47.612
and fringe players to move in.

45:47.645 --> 45:49.815
Usurp your business.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.783
All that happens

45:51.817 --> 45:54.052
while you are in
the U.S. courts

45:54.085 --> 45:57.455
fighting
a drug-trafficking charge.

46:02.660 --> 46:05.463
You took my son...

46:05.496 --> 46:08.333
to set me up for all this.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.935
Yes.

46:09.968 --> 46:12.637
(tense music)

46:12.670 --> 46:14.639
To force my hand.

46:14.672 --> 46:16.441
No.

46:16.474 --> 46:18.243
*

46:18.276 --> 46:22.513
To show what our hands
can do together.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.816
If the Galindo Cartel falls,

46:24.850 --> 46:27.652
another will take its place.

46:27.685 --> 46:30.521
Violence continues.

46:30.555 --> 46:32.790
Corruption still thrives.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.162
Our government...

46:38.629 --> 46:41.432
Every branch...

46:41.466 --> 46:44.335
every level...

46:44.369 --> 46:46.071
is infected.

46:47.705 --> 46:51.276
Social services,
education,

46:51.309 --> 46:53.444
health care.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.680
The money never ends up helping

46:55.713 --> 46:58.383
the people who need it.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.818
Lopez Obrador
won't change anything.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.156
We know
we can't defeat evil.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.360
All we can do...

47:09.394 --> 47:12.197
is point it
in the right direction.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.234
Let evil...

47:16.267 --> 47:17.735
feed our children,

47:17.768 --> 47:19.537
care for our sick.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.539
We let...

47:21.572 --> 47:23.875
the devil...

47:23.909 --> 47:25.676
secure our future.

47:25.710 --> 47:28.213
And I'm that devil.

47:28.246 --> 47:30.982
*

47:31.016 --> 47:34.485
Los Olvidados is everywhere.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.422
We are 2,000 strong,

47:37.455 --> 47:39.824
and growing every day.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.093
We become your eyes.

47:42.127 --> 47:44.029
Your ears.

47:44.062 --> 47:46.164
Your weapons.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.565
*

47:47.598 --> 47:49.700
You continue to...

47:49.734 --> 47:52.370
distance yourself
from the blood.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.739
*

47:54.772 --> 47:56.041
In return...

47:57.575 --> 47:59.810
You give us a piece
of the profit.

48:01.279 --> 48:03.614
Help us put it in the hands

48:03.648 --> 48:05.416
of the people who need it.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.355
The system...

48:10.388 --> 48:12.057
is broken.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.561
Together...

48:16.594 --> 48:18.796
we create a new one.

48:20.498 --> 48:21.933
Partners.

48:24.769 --> 48:26.604
Huh.

48:30.508 --> 48:34.045
The things we've done...

48:34.079 --> 48:36.614
our hatred...

48:36.647 --> 48:39.417
runs deep.

48:39.450 --> 48:42.420
How do we ever trust...

48:42.453 --> 48:43.654
Adelita?

48:43.688 --> 48:49.460
*

48:49.494 --> 48:51.829
We begin by telling
the truth.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.110
My name...

49:05.143 --> 49:07.012
is Luisa Espina.

49:09.147 --> 49:12.317
And until we earn...

49:12.350 --> 49:14.285
that trust...

49:14.319 --> 49:16.121
*

49:16.154 --> 49:19.624
We'll need a third party.

49:19.657 --> 49:23.528
Someone with
a vested interest...

49:23.561 --> 49:25.496
in keeping us honest.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.634
I'll let you give it
some thought.

49:29.667 --> 49:36.541
*

49:38.309 --> 49:40.478
(door closes)

49:40.511 --> 49:47.385
*

49:53.091 --> 49:55.460
Before we knew it,
prospect circled back,

49:55.493 --> 49:58.563
said something to the cops,
was in the wind.

49:58.596 --> 50:01.899
-It was a solitary decision.
TAZA: He had no bedroll.

50:01.932 --> 50:04.469
He knew it was just
a harassment stop.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.003
What were they gonna
get him on?

50:06.037 --> 50:09.006
Maybe reckless driving,
speeding.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.676
Pulls the heat away from this.

50:11.709 --> 50:14.011
Little brother's got
some balls.

50:14.045 --> 50:16.047
Little brother's here.

50:17.082 --> 50:18.716
Just walked in.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.418
Send him back.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.520
RIZ: (sniffs)
All right.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.724
Prospect!

50:38.936 --> 50:40.938
-Shit.
-(grunts)

50:40.971 --> 50:42.907
What happened?

50:42.940 --> 50:45.610
I let them catch me
when I was clear of the club.

50:47.712 --> 50:50.748
Weren't gonna do the paperwork
for a stack of misdemeanors.

50:50.781 --> 50:53.118
Took their pound of flesh.

50:56.487 --> 50:57.822
You're a smart kid, EZ.

51:01.759 --> 51:03.561
Putting yourself on the line
for the club,

51:03.594 --> 51:06.063
that's commendable.

51:06.097 --> 51:09.600
But it was also impulsive
and fucking rogue.

51:09.634 --> 51:11.269
The kind of shit
that will get you killed

51:11.302 --> 51:13.638
and, more importantly
get one of us killed.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.116
Sorry.

51:28.819 --> 51:30.988
If it happens again...

51:31.021 --> 51:33.424
you're done.

51:33.458 --> 51:35.593
And what comes with that
will make the CHP beat-down

51:35.626 --> 51:37.262
feel like a day at the spa.

51:41.966 --> 51:43.534
Get out of here.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.751
How much more time
does he have left?

52:00.785 --> 52:03.321
(sighs)
About eight months.

52:05.223 --> 52:07.825
Got a feeling it's gonna be
a very long eight months.

52:07.858 --> 52:11.296
(all chuckle)

52:11.329 --> 52:13.464
Watch it, bro.

52:13.498 --> 52:15.800
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
head over to Vicki's.

52:23.007 --> 52:25.243
(approaching car engine)

52:30.848 --> 52:32.417
EZ Peasy!

52:33.851 --> 52:35.986
-Oh, my God.
-(breathing heavily)

52:36.020 --> 52:38.155
Come on.

52:38.189 --> 52:40.191
Okay.

52:40.225 --> 52:42.159
(sniffling)

52:44.161 --> 52:46.897
She just called me
twenty minutes ago.

52:46.931 --> 52:48.533
What happened?

52:48.566 --> 52:50.167
Celia.

52:50.201 --> 52:52.403
She almost killed me.

52:52.437 --> 52:55.440

53:08.519 --> 53:10.555
Your mom.

53:13.291 --> 53:15.393
Clean her up.

53:15.426 --> 53:18.396
(dark music)

53:18.429 --> 53:19.764
*

53:19.797 --> 53:22.233
Should we go with?

53:22.267 --> 53:24.068
Ain't our business.
