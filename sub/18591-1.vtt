00:51.635 --> 00:55.639
But i never
had the time

00:58.141 --> 01:00.644
time

01:07.150 --> 01:11.655
i always thought
that we were friends

01:14.157 --> 01:17.160

but i never had
the time.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.733
Hey, ace.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.249
Speed's expensive. How
fast do you want to go?

03:13.777 --> 03:17.281
Any town's a nice little
town when you nail a broad.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.785
Starting to get
nervous, huh?

03:30.294 --> 03:32.296
There she is.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.306
- Yeah, i know what you mean.
- I figured you would.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.869
I promised you after word
from sonny's drive-in.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.418
Go ahead.
Back it off.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.948
Hey! Asshole!

06:23.425 --> 06:26.428
I was washing my hair.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.938
Hello?

06:49.451 --> 06:51.954
- Yeah?
- Everything under control?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.961
It's been delivered
and it's just waiting.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.465
Okay, i'll see
you real soon.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.987
Call him.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.490
I said, call him.

08:04.526 --> 08:08.030
- Yeah- would you like me to
get that? - No. Do you know her?

08:09.531 --> 08:12.034
Oh god, please answer.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.563
Please.

08:57.579 --> 09:01.083
If you don't give
him the money.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.593
Let me talk to him.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.111
I changed my mind.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.667
Morning, mr. Stanton.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.177
It was supposed
to be open.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.690
It's a local call.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.219
Whoever it is, get rid of
'em like i told you before.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.725
- Hello?
- Is the man of the house there?

11:46.748 --> 11:49.251
Yeah, that's right

11:54.756 --> 11:57.259
- you can't let him do this. Please.
- No.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.277
It'll be all right now,
honey. It'll be all right.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.781
Terrific.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.285
I even brought
my own bag.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.791
Try not to squash
the tomatoes.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.816
And you cease to be a family
man right then and there.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.223
Hi, asshole.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.727
What did you do
with the keys?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.740
She ought to be
paid like one, right?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.245
If you don't give me those
keys, i'm going to pop you.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.753
Oh!

14:00.757 --> 14:04.261
That's right, lady.
Now, let's have the keys.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.771
Okay. Relax.

14:36.293 --> 14:40.797
Those were the keys
to my grandfather's pickup.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.812
You just holler.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.332
Did you see that crazy son of a bitch?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.871
- You won't yell?
You promise? - Uh-huh.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.877
I'm trusting you now

16:16.393 --> 16:19.897
no. Would you go back
to your office now?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.403
Mr. Stanton?

16:55.432 --> 16:58.435
You better check with the
stewardess in tourist section.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.955
Get in.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.971
As full of shit
as that, huh?

18:21.018 --> 18:23.020
Honest, i was spouting off
to a dial tone.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.531
You are a neighbor
and, uh...

18:46.543 --> 18:48.545
did i get a wrong-

19:04.561 --> 19:06.563
after an incoming call.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.104
- Yeah.
- Far out!

20:59.176 --> 21:02.679
Had to pick up
a flag, didn't you?

21:08.185 --> 21:11.188
- What?
- I don't know, i thought maybe you'd know.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.292
Souped?

22:19.798 --> 22:21.800
Let's go.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.837
I'm glad!

23:10.349 --> 23:12.351
Your friend's
a real dazzler.

23:14.353 --> 23:17.856
D-a-z-z-l-e-r.

23:40.379 --> 23:43.882
Okay, hang on.

25:24.316 --> 25:28.320
You know what it means when somebody
like me gets off to a bad start?

25:29.821 --> 25:32.324
Not a god-damn thing.

26:35.387 --> 26:38.891
You've been holding those cars over my
head a year and i'm getting tired of it.

27:21.433 --> 27:24.937
It's got nothing to do with you
or you getting your new patrol cars.

27:26.939 --> 27:28.941
Kiss my ass.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.948
That's not nice.

28:13.986 --> 28:15.988
Sheriff's department,
please, right away.

29:35.901 --> 29:38.403
I'd like to get out
and look at the car.

29:47.913 --> 29:49.915
Oh, just beautiful.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.931
Yeah. Thanks.

30:07.432 --> 30:09.935
Come on. Let's get
this turkey under-cover.

30:37.462 --> 30:39.965
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

30:45.470 --> 30:47.973
Haul ass to mccullough!

31:13.499 --> 31:16.502
Now, that was cute.
That was real cute.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.025
Headquarters
to cars 2 and 12.

31:46.532 --> 31:49.034
This is a hell of a time
for a pit stop.

32:28.073 --> 32:31.076
- Deke, you going to be a while?
- Yeah.

32:33.579 --> 32:35.080
Great.

32:50.095 --> 32:52.097
Of how little
i was getting.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.169
That is totally true.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.188
Unload.
Kiss off.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.208
- Goodbye!
- Hello.

34:47.212 --> 34:50.215
Deke, what are you trying to
do, establish squatter's rights?

35:04.730 --> 35:06.732
And you underneath
with me.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.237
Terrific.

35:23.749 --> 35:25.751
- Hey!
- What?

35:32.758 --> 35:35.260
Maybe i don't want
to say goodbye.

35:43.769 --> 35:46.271
But i'm having trouble

35:53.278 --> 35:56.782
trying to win enough money
to build some real speed.

36:09.795 --> 36:12.798
And now l-
i've got-

36:15.300 --> 36:18.303
i need you...

36:19.805 --> 36:22.808
to help us
with the car.

36:30.315 --> 36:32.317
You got it.

37:12.649 --> 37:16.653
And see if you get the words
"son of a bitch" in print.

37:36.673 --> 37:39.676
Hey, start moving
the wheel!

37:43.680 --> 37:45.682
Just a second.

38:06.703 --> 38:08.705
Well, pay attention.

38:10.207 --> 38:12.209
I'll pay attention.

38:17.714 --> 38:20.217
- She got bored.
- Oh, great.

38:22.219 --> 38:24.221
Turn it to the left!

38:29.726 --> 38:32.729
- Is it coming?
- Yeah, work it some more!

38:36.233 --> 38:38.735
To the right!
Are you stupid?!

38:45.242 --> 38:47.244
Larry?

38:49.746 --> 38:51.748
Larry!

38:58.255 --> 39:00.257
Uh...

39:25.282 --> 39:27.284
yes, sir.

39:49.932 --> 39:51.934
Why?

39:52.935 --> 39:54.937
G.
'Cause we're stoppin

40:15.958 --> 40:19.962

to europe with jamie richardson.

40:55.998 --> 40:59.501
- Mister, she's gonna talk.
- So what?

41:06.008 --> 41:08.510
Check the map
for that second turn.

41:10.512 --> 41:13.015
- Where'd you put it?
- Under the seat.

41:15.517 --> 41:17.519
Have you gone crazy?
It's not here.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.031
That's what
i'm going to break.

41:54.056 --> 41:57.059
- Hi.
- Hi. Hand it over.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.063
Oh, sure.
Why not?

42:13.575 --> 42:15.577
- Then you-
- get in.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.127
Car 10 in hot pursuit.

43:32.821 --> 43:34.823
What, are you worried
you can't outdrive him?

43:52.341 --> 43:54.843
Don't mean a thing.
She always overheats.

43:55.844 --> 43:58.347
Come on, baby!
God damn it, let's go.

44:09.858 --> 44:11.360
I ain't blowing
nothin', partner.

44:26.375 --> 44:28.877
Whoo!

44:37.886 --> 44:40.889
Tappets.

45:26.435 --> 45:30.439
Contact that helicopter. Tell them
to meet me at beacon's corner.

45:55.464 --> 45:58.467
Yeah, well we're going
to get right back on it.

48:04.593 --> 48:06.595
Headquarters calling
captain franklin.

48:10.599 --> 48:14.102
Give me that thing. Franklin,
this is donahue. Come in, please.

48:17.105 --> 48:20.108
Donahue: Everett, i want you
to get back to headquarters now.

48:23.612 --> 48:26.615
Everett, aren't you taking this
pursuit a little bit personal?

48:35.624 --> 48:38.126
What's that
supposed to mean?

48:52.641 --> 48:56.144
That's all you got in your brain is
having the biggest troop in this state.

49:00.649 --> 49:02.651
I want you
to catch 'em.

49:19.168 --> 49:21.170
- Hey, carl?
- What?

49:22.671 --> 49:24.673
Kiss my ass!

50:29.738 --> 50:33.242
I was given orders to hit it
and get it, and i follow orders.

50:37.246 --> 50:39.748
Let's go.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.682
There she is.

51:43.687 --> 51:46.190
Then we'll get the tools.
Come on.

51:55.699 --> 51:58.702
- I said i'll be back in a minute.
- Oh.

52:34.738 --> 52:36.740
I'll take it.

53:02.766 --> 53:04.768
Why don't you watch out
what you're doing?

53:16.780 --> 53:18.782
Mm-hmm.

53:40.304 --> 53:44.308
What's the matter, mary? Ain't
we good enough for you anymore?

53:53.817 --> 53:55.819
Same old technique.
Whew!

54:16.840 --> 54:19.843
Look what i got you.

54:29.853 --> 54:32.856
Hey, there's a blue chevy.

54:59.883 --> 55:02.386
Hey, i think
we should go.

55:26.910 --> 55:28.912
Car 20 to headquarters.

55:43.427 --> 55:46.930
- Which way are they headed?
- Fryman road area, south.

55:50.934 --> 55:54.938
Notify all of the cars to
make a sweep in that area.

56:06.950 --> 56:09.953
Uh, i might not be able
to hear them pipes.

56:13.457 --> 56:15.959
Did anybody see
a license number?

56:18.462 --> 56:21.965
Hey, had a black
racing stripe.

57:10.013 --> 57:12.015
Mmm!

57:19.523 --> 57:23.026
Larry: Well, well, well. Hi, guys.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.542
They're about four miles
south of miner road.

57:41.545 --> 57:44.047
Oh, shit.

57:47.050 --> 57:49.052
Officer:
Son of a-

57:57.561 --> 57:59.563
now, what did
that billboard say?

58:45.108 --> 58:48.111
That means he's gonna
set up roadblocks.

59:33.657 --> 59:35.659
Where are you?

59:47.671 --> 59:50.174
All right.
Listen to this.

01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:09.193
Unlimited.

01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:17.701
The roadblock at old 99
junction is now set up, sir.

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:36.720
Hey, what do you know?

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:40.224
A landing spot.

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:34.278
Aphrodisiac, huh?

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.781
With you around?

01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:06.810
Hey, that's $1.85.

01:02:23.327 --> 01:02:25.329
Computer.
Shit.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:42.346
Lots of green between
those balls, you know?

01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:50.854
This table's
kind of screwy, too.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:22.886
When deke shoots pool, he's so loaded,
he usuall y can't see the table.

01:03:30.394 --> 01:03:33.897
Hey now, bunky, that ain't an
excuse to go on a binge, you know.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.910
Ain't no drunk costin
g me another race.

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:55.419
You walk now, mister, and
we'll hang it up for good.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.926
I think maybe
we ought to go.

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:41.215
No sign of them
yet, sir. Over.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.223
18 minutes since
your call. Over.

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:56.730
Maybe that clown
got us wired.

01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:46.780
Give me a piece of paper
and a pencil.

01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:03.797
- Little miss mary's gonna do us a favor.
- Why should i?

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.803
Well, because
i'm asking you to.

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:16.810
Okay.
What is it?

01:06:41.335 --> 01:06:42.836
Let's gas up
and get out of here.

01:07:12.866 --> 01:07:14.368
Over and out.

01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:38.392
Ooh-whee!

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:45.899
Hey, hold it!

01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:14.428
Swing off and pass.

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:51.465
- Bunky! Hey, bunky,
cheer up!

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:55.969
All right, get me
to that walnut grove.

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:54.528
- What you slow down for?!
- He wants to play.

01:09:59.032 --> 01:10:02.035
I think someone's
knocking on the door.

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:14.548
I hope he's
a good sailor.

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:46.580
Give me that mic.

01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:07.100
If you really get it on,
you may be able to cover 15.

01:11:19.613 --> 01:11:21.615
Listen to him.

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:56.650
It's just a matter of when.
Now, get off that line.

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:35.689
We haven't got
any fuel left.

01:13:11.225 --> 01:13:13.727
You probably did.

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:21.235
Let's go fix up
the front end.

01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:25.739
Hey, wait a minute.
Fix up the front end?

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:47.261
Yeah.

01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:44.318
I got a way. Maybe you
can save yourself, mary.

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:14.848
Don't you do that
again, ever.

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:19.853
If she has any sense about
her, i won't need to.

01:15:28.362 --> 01:15:31.865
To get up by yourself, you
don't think anybody can, huh?

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.372
Come on!
Say it again!

01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:47.381
Just fix
the god damn wheel.

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:23.917
Hey!
Wait a minute!

01:16:43.937 --> 01:16:45.939
Why?

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.945
I'm his mechanic

01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:57.451
so what?
You don't have to be.

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:02.956
Well, i mean, you said half
the money's yours, right?

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:06.960
You and i, we could-

01:17:10.464 --> 01:17:12.466
it's not that at all.

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.972
Well, i do lie a little.

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:28.482
But the reason
i lie...

01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:33.987
i know you, miss mary.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:38.992
You do?

01:17:48.502 --> 01:17:51.505
I mean, you're good.
Even i know that.

01:18:03.016 --> 01:18:06.019
I drank myself right out
of the entire circuit.

01:18:19.032 --> 01:18:21.535
I don't have
anything else to do.

01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:35.549
Yeah, but i
always think that.

01:18:38.552 --> 01:18:41.555
Now, let's get on
with our business.

01:19:54.086 --> 01:19:57.089
Just hold on to them.
Be right with you.

01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:07.099
I'm gonna stick right up
your ass this time, buddy.

01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:13.105
Hang on. I think we got a mover here.

01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:21.613
I'm gonna eat your lunch,
you long-haired faggot.

01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:29.121
He's staying with you.

01:20:37.129 --> 01:20:40.132
You'd better get, and i'm gonna
put you right up against the wall.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:50.142
- If he gets any closer, i'm gonna lunch him.
- Come on! Shake him!

01:20:59.151 --> 01:21:02.154
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna powder his face.

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:19.171
It's gonna take more than that to dust
me off 'cause this is where i came from.

01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:41.693
I'm going to show you
my twice-piped system, buddy!

01:22:12.724 --> 01:22:17.229
Keep going, partner, 'cause
my top end is unlimited.

01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.749
Damn.

01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:13.577
And the steering wheel's
loose anyway.

01:23:28.926 --> 01:23:32.429
Get me over there.
Come on.

01:23:48.946 --> 01:23:50.447
You're just wasting gas.

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:56.954
- All right. It's up to you.
- What is?

01:23:58.455 --> 01:24:00.958
- I want 'em stopped.
- Stoppedhow?

01:24:15.973 --> 01:24:19.977
'Cause i'm going to give
it a try. So go on down there.

01:24:20.978 --> 01:24:23.480
I said go on
down there!

01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:34.491
Come on!

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:55.512
Let me talk to him.

01:25:07.024 --> 01:25:10.527
This ain't no dirt track,
roundy-rounder.

01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:19.036
Come on!

01:26:06.583 --> 01:26:08.585
I believe you're right.

01:26:11.588 --> 01:26:12.589
Crash into him!

01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:26.603
- Fuel!
- Come on!

01:26:28.105 --> 01:26:30.607
- We're out of fuel!
- God damn it!

01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:39.616
Go ahead
and set it down!

01:26:51.628 --> 01:26:54.631
All you got to be is willing
to take it to the max.

01:27:22.159 --> 01:27:25.662
Those cars ain't within 10 miles of
where he's talking. What's he doing?

01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:33.670
Mary:
And you go right.

01:27:56.193 --> 01:27:57.194
Jeez.

01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:13.210
From your coordinate,
r-3 and walnut.

01:28:20.217 --> 01:28:22.219
Two up and left again.

01:28:36.733 --> 01:28:38.735
He's trying to make 'em
outdrive themselves.

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:01.758
One over, left!

01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:17.274
Okay.
Two up, left.

01:29:45.302 --> 01:29:48.806
Hey, bunky,
he's strokingyou.

01:30:27.344 --> 01:30:31.348
Yeah, but i'd like
to call not collect.

01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:05.382
It sure looks that way.

01:31:54.932 --> 01:31:57.434
Time

01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:08.946
i always thought
that we were friends

01:32:11.448 --> 01:32:13.951
time

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:25.462
but you slipped
right through my hands.
