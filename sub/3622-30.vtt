WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.939
TEACHER: <i>All right, listen
up, field-trippers.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:08.874
<i>Some of you may not think</i>

00:08.876 --> 00:11.076
that history is cool or fun

00:11.078 --> 00:12.678
or interesting.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.113
Fine with me. I'm paid
to teach, not entertain.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.080
Ron!

00:15.082 --> 00:16.915
I'm awake.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.218
( <i>snoring</i>)

00:19.220 --> 00:21.086
Rufus!

00:22.689 --> 00:25.057
100 years ago,
the world came to Middleton.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.959
Where did they all stay?

00:26.961 --> 00:29.128
The fair introduced
new techno wonders

00:29.130 --> 00:31.563
like the Ferris wheel,
photographic sound,

00:31.565 --> 00:33.098
even ice cream and hamburgers.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.900
And that's all peachy swell.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.602
But for the next 90 minutes,

00:36.604 --> 00:39.104
I'm going to focus on obscure
names, dates and statistics.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.272
( <i>all groan</i> )

00:40.274 --> 00:42.574
Kim, this
is a snackage emergency.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.209
We need sugar and lots of it.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.745
That's what I'm talking about.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.113
Wow, look at this.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.816
I wonder how old
these candies are.

00:50.818 --> 00:51.984
No way!

00:54.554 --> 00:56.622
Ooh, yeah! Yummy!

00:56.624 --> 00:57.689
Spark Rocks.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.124
I haven't had these
bad boys in years.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.826
See, when you bite them,

01:00.828 --> 01:02.061
they actually send a jolt
of static electricity

01:02.063 --> 01:03.063
through your soft tissue.

01:04.964 --> 01:06.198
My hair standing on end?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.766
No more so than usual.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.767
That's funny.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.969
Maybe it's because they expired

01:10.971 --> 01:12.704
when we were in pre-K.

01:12.706 --> 01:13.939
Come on.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.040
Note the resemblance.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.575
My own great grandpap

01:16.577 --> 01:19.778
was the chief of police
back at the big expo.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.346
Ron. Shh.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.755
Kim, check this.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.124
They look like us.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.625
That's right.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.360
"Detective Jonathan Stoppable

01:35.362 --> 01:39.598
and ace reporter
Meriam Possible"?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.365
Meriam?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.167
Went by Mim in her bylines.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.203
From all accounts, she was
a lot like you, Possible.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.839
Spunky, headstrong,
disrespectful.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.273
I am not!

01:48.275 --> 01:50.809
Hey, I wonder why my dad's
never mentioned her.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.311
Maybe because Mim Possible

01:52.313 --> 01:54.646
pulled off the crime

KIM: My ancestor,
criminal of the century?

03:00.414 --> 03:03.348
Don't worry, Kim,
the century was young.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.884
I'm sure other
people did worse...

03:05.886 --> 03:07.119
eventually.

03:07.121 --> 03:08.787
Mr. Barkin, what did she do?

03:08.789 --> 03:11.223
Vamoosed with some
big new invention.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.092
It was scandalous.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.094
What's the prob, K?

03:16.096 --> 03:18.297
Not the history lesson
you were expecting?

03:18.299 --> 03:19.464
I need to know more.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.866
Here you go.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.769
According to Grandpap's
official report...

03:23.771 --> 03:26.705
<i>"I was patrolling the Expo</i>
<i>with Detective Stoppable."</i>

03:26.707 --> 03:28.140
Mim thinks we should
beef up security

03:28.142 --> 03:29.241
around the new invention,

03:29.243 --> 03:31.476
the electro whatever it is.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.477
Detective Stoppable,

03:32.479 --> 03:34.179
high-falutin' lady journalists

03:34.181 --> 03:36.215
don't make the security
decisions around here.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.783
I do.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.851
Well, she did help us solve
the warehouse arson case

03:39.853 --> 03:41.954
and she was right about the
missing African diamond caper.

03:41.956 --> 03:42.988
And she...

03:42.990 --> 03:44.423
Slam, Stoppable!

03:44.425 --> 03:46.858
MAN:
Help! Constable, help!

03:46.860 --> 03:48.026
Constable?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.261
I think he means us.
Pedal, man!

03:49.263 --> 03:51.263
Pedal like the wind.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.140
My greatest invention, stolen!

04:04.043 --> 04:05.377
Mim!

04:05.379 --> 04:07.079
Wake up, man.
She played you for a mug,

04:07.081 --> 04:08.413
a patsy,
a two-bit dupe.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.915
You're still mad about the time

04:09.917 --> 04:12.084
I accidentally ate
your pickled egg, aren't you?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.452
She sent you off to jawbone me

04:13.454 --> 04:14.519
and keep us both busy

04:14.521 --> 04:16.755
while she pulled off
the heist herself.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.025
Mim a thief?
I don't believe it, sir.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.360
I don't believe it, either.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.528
There's some additional
documentation

04:23.530 --> 04:26.798
as to the pickled egg,
but I think we get the gist.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.434
And your family had the nerve
to stay in this town?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.937
That's just one Barkin's
opinion, Bonnie.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.205
It's not too late to move.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.339
You know, start over

04:34.341 --> 04:36.174
where people don't know
the shame

04:36.176 --> 04:37.342
of the Possible name.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.177
( <i>snickers</i>)

04:39.179 --> 04:41.847
Why have I never heard of you?

04:42.782 --> 04:44.049
<i>I hate to admit it, Kimmy,</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:46.385
but all family trees
have their weak limbs.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.453
Great Aunt Miriam
was a real spitfire.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.289
A muckraker. Fearless.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.823
Could have been the greatest.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.158
So what happened to her?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.127
Well, once she was accused,

04:55.129 --> 04:56.928
our little black sheep
went on the lam.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.965
How could anybody who did
so much good go so bad?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.133
Ah, don't worry, Kimmy.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.534
I'm sure
it won't happen to you.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.270
Oh, that's <i>not</i> where
you were going with this.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.471
No.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.074
I just have a hunch
that Mim's innocent.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.476
Well, they never found
the stolen invention,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.845
and since she ran off,
her reputation was ruined.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.947
But if no one ever proved
that she did it,

05:15.949 --> 05:18.583
there's still a chance
that she didn't.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.386
Maybe, but so what?
It was a century ago, Kim.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.355
BONNIE: Oh, yeah, stealing
runs in the family.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.991
I always said
all her best cheer moves

05:25.993 --> 05:27.259
were ripped off from me.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.062
( <i>growls</i> )

05:30.064 --> 05:32.297
KP, dig it!
I found this at home.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.598
A journal of
Jonathan Stoppable?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.033
Slammin'.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.335
Where'd you find this?

05:36.337 --> 05:38.003
It's been under our kitchen
table's wobbly leg

05:38.005 --> 05:39.438
for, like, ever.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.140
Just noticed it there
this morning. Weird, huh?

05:42.142 --> 05:43.275
Ah, okay. Here it is.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.143
"Today at the World's Fair,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.979
I saw the future,
and it's name is Taco."

05:47.981 --> 05:50.515
Hey, tacos here.
Get your tacos.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.289
Jonathan! Jon!

05:57.291 --> 05:59.391
You were supposed to meet me

05:59.393 --> 06:02.294
at the Hall of
Electricity an hour ago.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.031
You want 'em or not?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.399
He wants them.
Trust me.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.003
Crunchy, spicy, cheesy.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.239
I am one satisfied customer.

06:15.408 --> 06:18.110
My only satisfied customer.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.549
Take heart,
my good taco hawker.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.385
No one applauds
real pioneers in their time.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.519
Make haste, Jon.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.388
We must get
to the Hall of Electricity

06:29.390 --> 06:31.656
before Professor DeMenz
begins his demonstration.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.024
What demonstration?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.060
Everyone at the fair
is atwitter about it.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.061
He calls it the...

06:36.063 --> 06:38.296
"Electrostatic Illuminator."

06:38.298 --> 06:41.566
That's right!
The Electrostatic Illuminator!

06:41.568 --> 06:44.403
A timer.
I set it for 60 seconds.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.205
Now I will absorb, contain,

06:47.207 --> 06:51.243
and control power
from the very air.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.644
Observe!

06:52.646 --> 06:53.645
When it goes off...

06:53.647 --> 06:54.513
( <i>ringing</i> )

06:54.515 --> 06:55.914
Hmm!

06:59.385 --> 07:00.752
It's no taco.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.955
Imagine how this marvel
can be used.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.323
Excuse me, Professor?

07:05.325 --> 07:07.292
How can this marvel be used?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.528
I said imagine, Miss.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.930
So go ahead. I'll wait.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.698
You don't know what to do
with it, do you, Professor?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.700
Well, it makes lightning.

07:15.702 --> 07:19.104
That's got to be good
for something, yeah?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.273
Something dangerous,
I'm afraid.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.508
In the wrong hands, I suppose.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.709
Maybe.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.179
Stop that!

07:27.181 --> 07:29.147
( <i>whistling</i>)

07:29.149 --> 07:31.183
I'm concerned that some
nefarious character

07:31.185 --> 07:32.284
might try to thieve it.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.954
My dear girl,
you are a worrywart.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.623
What kind of nefarious character

07:38.625 --> 07:40.225
would be bent
on wreaking such havoc?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.727
Oh, I have a strong notion.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.129
Who? Who?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.130
Two weeks!

07:45.132 --> 07:47.165
If they were normal termites,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.568
we'd be talking
two or three days tops.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.103
But these seem
to be mutant termites.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.405
Mutant?! Really?

07:53.407 --> 07:56.041
Well, I can assure
you I have no idea

07:56.043 --> 07:57.442
how they got that way.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.110
Mad scientists...

07:59.112 --> 08:02.180
always perverting nature in
their twisted quest for power.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.448
The lair doesn't have

08:03.450 --> 08:05.050
to be tented the
entire time, does it?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.051
Oh, no.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.385
Out of the two weeks,

08:07.387 --> 08:10.155
the tent will only be up
for, eh, 14 days.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.490
Thank goodness.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.591
Very funny.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.459
Hey, I do what I can.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.695
But where will I hatch
my evil schemes?

08:16.697 --> 08:17.762
Relax, Dr. D.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.763
I took care of it.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.599
Ah, goo.. Oh, no.

08:20.601 --> 08:24.302
Please, not the time-share lair.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.371
Oh, how I loathe this place.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.006
What a mess.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.774
Let me guess.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.277
Previous tenant,
Professor Dementor?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.646
No. It's someone named DeMenz.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.015
Doy.
That's Dementor's real name.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.149
He uses a fake name?

08:38.151 --> 08:40.185
Yeah, can you imagine?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.586
Drew Lipsky?

08:42.388 --> 08:43.755
Hold up.
What does that say?

08:43.757 --> 08:45.156
"Collector plates,

08:45.158 --> 08:46.791
limited edition figurines
and brick-a-brack."

08:46.793 --> 08:48.193
Hmm.
Not interested.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.361
Not that box.
That one.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.596
"The groundbreaking work
of my ancestor

08:51.598 --> 08:54.533
that could be used
to wreak havoc."

08:54.535 --> 08:56.468
All right. I'll bite.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.639

Why does that ring a bell?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.643
Can it be?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.111
What?

09:06.113 --> 09:06.811
It would be an uncanny
coincidence.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.179
What?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.447
If this is what I think it is.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.415
What!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.651
It's a Lipsky family legend.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.286
I must possess it.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.054
This thing
is, like, 100 years old.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.422
Why are you interested in it?

09:17.424 --> 09:19.357
Because, Shego,

09:19.359 --> 09:22.193
the Electrostatic Illuminator

09:22.195 --> 09:25.230
is the reason
I became a villain!

09:25.232 --> 09:27.532
( <i>evil laugh</i> )

09:30.836 --> 09:33.104
Dr. D, I thought you
became a villain

09:33.106 --> 09:35.740
because of the guys
who teased you in nerd school.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.810
Well, thank you for
harshing my mellow, Shego.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.279
Now quickly,
to my mother's attic.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.316
All right. I'm going to go,
but I am not sure why.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.785
KIM:
<i>It's pretty amazing, really.</i>

09:46.787 --> 09:48.253
A machine that can actually

09:48.255 --> 09:50.288
absorb the static electricity
out of the air

09:50.290 --> 09:52.390
and fire it back
like a bolt of lightening.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.694
So now we know what the
Electrostatic Illuminator was.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.229
And that Mim was trying
to keep it safe.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.431

10:00.866 --> 10:02.233
What's the sitch, Wade?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.869
We got a big break in the case.
Get this.

10:04.871 --> 10:08.273
My great-great grand uncle Wayne
was the expo photographer.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.674
Are you kidding me?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.743
Another freaky coincidence?

10:15.582 --> 10:18.350

Wayne's original pictures.

Wade, that can't
really be Drakken.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.136
It isn't.
It's his ancestor.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.771
Drakken had
an ancestor there, too?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.905
Okay, okay, you know what?

10:40.907 --> 10:42.273
This is just getting ludicrous.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.775
Yep.
Bartholomew Lipsky.

The nut doesn't fall far
from the tree.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.517
Acorn, but you're right.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.586
A Lipsky on the scene
can't be good.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.556
I'm sick of waiting, Lipsky.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.458
Let's steal the fool thing
and get it over with.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.293

Tonight, when there are
no witnesses,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.531
that is when we strike.

And when the Electrostatic

there, Wayne.

fires off a bolt,

We only have ten minutes.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.218
Let's review what we know.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.353
That's where Mim was
when she got the case...

18:47.059 --> 18:49.193
This is where they were

18:49.195 --> 18:51.395
<i>when Mim almost fell.</i>

18:57.803 --> 18:59.137
( <i>both gasp</i> )

18:59.139 --> 19:03.941
So, if it fell from the top...
the taco stand!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.877
I can't believe Jon
wouldn't have looked there.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.945
Tacos?!
It's a burger stand.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.014
This picture was taken
after that day.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.949
The taco stand must've gone
out of business.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.118
Real pioneers are never
celebrated in their time.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.419
Did you say taco stand?

19:15.421 --> 19:16.787
( <i>Rufus whistles</i> )

19:16.789 --> 19:18.256
Over here!

19:28.967 --> 19:30.334
Where is it? Where is it?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.070
Is it there?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.206
RON:
Found it.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.275
That's not the
Electrostatic Illuminator.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.077
Oh. Right, yeah. I was looking
for 100-year-old hot sauce.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.812
This stuff's got to pack
a punch now.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.214
( <i>gasps</i> )

19:43.216 --> 19:46.350
It's in the taco.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.689
WADE:
Kim, be super careful.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.458
Any tampering with the internal
mechanism will set it off.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.095
There's got to be some way
to disable it.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.764
I haven't figured
that part out yet.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.833
No worries; I'm sure we've
got a whole 60 seconds left.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.902
Actually, 55 seconds.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.070
Yeah, I got nothing.
Rufus?

20:06.072 --> 20:07.104
Uh-uh.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.472
30 seconds.

20:08.474 --> 20:09.740
( <i>click and electronic whoosh</i> )

20:09.742 --> 20:11.042
Huh?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.710
( <i>whoosh and rumbling</i>)

20:14.146 --> 20:16.447
( <i>evil laughter</i> )

20:19.318 --> 20:20.785
No way!

20:20.787 --> 20:23.154
( <i>console beeps</i> )

20:26.391 --> 20:29.327
I have succeeded where
my ancestor failed!

20:29.329 --> 20:31.062
Yeah, what are the chances
that he'd swoop in

20:31.064 --> 20:32.730
and save us at the last minute?

20:32.732 --> 20:36.067
The staggering power of the
Electrostatic Illuminator is mine!

20:36.069 --> 20:38.135
Wait a minute...
wait, wait, wait.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.071
Since when do you win?

20:40.073 --> 20:41.973
I guess I better
return the favor.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.741
There must be a catch.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.976
Hey!

20:44.978 --> 20:47.144
( <i>both grunting</i> )

20:47.146 --> 20:48.312
( <i>whizzing</i> )

20:48.314 --> 20:50.748
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Kim Possible!

20:50.750 --> 20:53.017
You think you're all that.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.785
But you're...

20:56.521 --> 20:58.055
Ah!

20:58.057 --> 21:00.891
You... You saved us.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.193
It's a hero thing.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.295
Oh, this is awkward.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.030
We must never
speak of it again.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.064
Fair enough.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.866
This whole thing is weird.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.134
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.036
It's almost
like a strange dream.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.205
( <i>snoring</i> )

21:14.207 --> 21:16.440
Stoppable, Possible...
come on!

21:16.442 --> 21:17.942
The exhibit's not that boring.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.377
Wow.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.312
I can't believe
I just zoned out like that.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.014
I can't believe
the dream I had.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.115
About our ancestors?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.116
At the expo?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.851
And Drakken and Shego too?

21:26.853 --> 21:30.254
So we had the exact same dream?

21:30.256 --> 21:32.056
Can't get
much weirder than that.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.924
MAN:
Heads up!

21:33.926 --> 21:35.126
No way.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.962
I'm going to have to say, way.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.298
Sorry about that, folks.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.099
Just bringing in
the new exhibit.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.467
Um, what was that dude's name?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.136
Beats me.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.406
Oh, that was the famous
young gladiator, Ronacus.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.841
Okay, I mean, come on!

21:50.843 --> 21:51.909
There's got to be a connection.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.512
Mm-mm. I'm standing by
my "no way."

21:54.514 --> 21:56.847
Well, Ronacus the Gladiator

21:56.849 --> 21:58.416
not only battled for survival,

21:58.418 --> 22:02.186
but to defeat
the evil Drakkus Maximus.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.655
Some say that this mysterious
masked warrior

22:04.657 --> 22:08.326
was the true key to the many
victories of Ronacus.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.194
Sounds about right.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.029
Hey, who got the big statue?

22:12.031 --> 22:13.264
Uh, uh, boo-ya.

22:13.266 --> 22:14.398
Whatever.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.101
CURATOR:
<i>Well, the evil Drakkus Maximus</i>

22:17.103 --> 22:19.503
<i>was bent on conquering...</i>
