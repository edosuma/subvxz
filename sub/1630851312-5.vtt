WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.704
Oh, hey, guys.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.445
How are you feeling after
that wild wedding last night?Ooh.

00:10.488 --> 00:13.970
Hungover and headachy, queasy.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.928
Damn, I had a good time.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.539
[mutters][laughs]

00:17.582 --> 00:20.020
TINA:
Oh, hey, Suraya.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.978
We were just talking
about your son's wedding.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.633
Oh, you Indian folks
sure know how to party.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.548
Ooh!You know,

00:26.591 --> 00:28.071
I think I threw my hip out

00:28.115 --> 00:29.812
when your granny and I
were dirty dancing.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.248
CALVIN:
Uh,

00:31.292 --> 00:34.077
Dave, I don't think
anybody would call

00:34.121 --> 00:36.036
what you were doing "dancing."

00:36.079 --> 00:37.428
Forget "Baby."

00:37.472 --> 00:39.039
Somebody should've
put you in a corner.[laughing]

00:39.082 --> 00:41.432
Okay, you know,
I don't care what you say.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.347
I had the time of my life.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.915
Well, these sweet laddoos
are my way

00:45.958 --> 00:48.222
of saying
"Thank you for coming."Oh.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.789
Ooh, well, don't
mind if I laddoo.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.053
[laughs]Hey, Suraya,

00:53.096 --> 00:55.403
uh, you're a professional
matchmaker.

00:55.446 --> 00:58.014
You know, you think
you can match up my boys?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.061
Oh, Malcolm and Marty would
never go for a matchmaker.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.715
Butler men like to hunt
for their own meat.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.849
I-I mean, women.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.853
I mean,
whatever's not offensive.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.161
I matched all my own sons.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.988
Even this one married
a beautiful lawyer,

01:16.032 --> 01:18.469
and he's into anime cosplay.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.429
Wow. She's gorgeous.

01:21.472 --> 01:22.952
Wait a minute.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.868
This woman married a dude
dressed as a lizard?

01:25.911 --> 01:28.349
I'm very good
at what I do.

01:28.392 --> 01:32.266
Okay. Well, "very good"
usually means very expensive.

01:32.309 --> 01:36.574
Well, how about, since
you fixed up our transmission,

01:36.618 --> 01:38.707
I fix up your boys?

01:38.750 --> 01:41.057
Okay. Thank you, Suraya.[laughs]
You bet.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.451
I'll see you soon.You got it.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.496
I don't know, Tina.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.107
I got a feeling this
thing is gonna blow up

01:47.150 --> 01:49.021
just like her
old transmission.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.981
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:52.024 --> 01:53.243
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.164
So, Malcolm
and Marty have no idea

02:01.208 --> 02:03.123
that I'm here
to find them wives?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.821
Nope. Think of it like
a timeshare presentation.

02:05.864 --> 02:09.694
First, we lure them in with
my famous berry cobbler.

02:09.738 --> 02:12.958
And then, wham! We trap them
with a lifetime commitment.Mm-hmm.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.136
Hey, hey.
Is the food ready?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.834
'Cause we're ready! [laughs]

02:18.877 --> 02:20.836
Oh, we got cobbler.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.620
Oh, we got company.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.970
[laughs]
Hey, Ms. Suraya.Hello.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.147
Wait.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.932
Why did you make all
of our favorite foods?

02:29.975 --> 02:31.499
Oh, no. Mama.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.197
You're not trying to
sell us supplements again?

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
Your mother thought
you could use some help

02:36.504 --> 02:38.375
meeting that someone special.

02:38.419 --> 02:42.162
Um, are y'all trying to hook one
of us up with Ms. Suraya?

02:42.205 --> 02:44.599
Don't you think
she's a little too old?

02:45.861 --> 02:47.819
I prefer "seasoned."

02:47.863 --> 02:49.517
And you should be so lucky.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.215
Mm...Um...

02:52.259 --> 02:55.044
Suraya is
a professional matchmaker.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.654
Well, thanks,
but I'm good.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.048
In fact, I canceled
a date just to be here.

02:59.091 --> 03:02.269
Okay, well, Marty?

03:02.312 --> 03:04.532
This cobbler's great. Okay.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.968
I'm interested.Yeah!

03:06.011 --> 03:07.535
Yes!Of course you are.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.624
It's the magic
of the cobbler.Mm-hmm.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.234
Well, that, and whatever
I'm doing isn't working.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
I need a date for my ten-year
high school reunion.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.499
And I'm not gonna be
the only single guy there again.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.284
It'll be like prom night
all over.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.722
So, Ms. Suraya, sign me up.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.333
Oh! Thank you, Jesus!

03:23.377 --> 03:25.640
There's hope
for grandbabies yet.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.643
Just have a girl first, and then
you can have whatever you want.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.256
Hey, honey. How was your day?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.998
Long.Oh. Mine, too.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.087
We've been working
way too hard lately.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.089
Yeah, I know. I mean,
I don't even remember

03:40.132 --> 03:41.786
the last time we sat
on this couch together.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.311
Well, you're here now. We can
finally catch up. So tell me,

03:44.354 --> 03:46.704
how was your day?Well...
Mom, Dad.

03:46.748 --> 03:50.534
I just remembered I didn't do
my book report on Tom Sawyer.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.276
Okay, well, when's it due?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.495
Tomorrow.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.454
Oh, no. Ugh.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.151
I'll help you.
Where's the book?

03:59.195 --> 04:00.240
The library.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.200
Come on, Grover.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
Sorry, hon. We'll catch
up this weekend.

04:07.899 --> 04:11.555
Hey, Suraya! So,
did you find Marty a wife yet?[laughing]

04:12.730 --> 04:14.689
It's been 24 hours.

04:14.732 --> 04:15.994
Oh. Come in.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.736
Tina, Marty's
a major project.

04:18.780 --> 04:22.479
Give the lady
another 20 minutes, okay?

04:22.523 --> 04:24.568
I have chosen a special group
of women,

04:24.612 --> 04:26.701
and these are their biodatas.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.443
They are like headshots
and résumés in one.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.923
Okay, well, you got anybody
in there that can cook?

04:31.967 --> 04:35.318
'Cause I need somebody to make
me some crab cakes for a change.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.451
And I need somebody
that's into sports.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.844
Any of these ladies come
with the NFL package?

04:39.888 --> 04:41.977
Oh, Marty doesn't
care about that.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.153
The boy tried to
dribble a football.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.069
I checked
for astrological compatibility,

04:47.112 --> 04:49.854
and I ran background checks
to make sure they're not psycho.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.335
And this is my top pick.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.511
[laughing]
Fatemeh Samuel.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.339
Oh, she's Ethiopian,

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
and she's an
interior designer.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.690
Very nice.Mm-hmm.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.563
Yeah, she's also very,
very nice looking.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.130
Back off of Marty's
future wife.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.741
You know what? I...

05:06.784 --> 05:08.786
I-I kind of like
this girl better.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.571
Asha Patel.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.617
Says she makes six figures,
and she works for Jet Blue.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.533
Can somebody say companion pass?

05:16.577 --> 05:18.840
Welcome to the family, Asha.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.668
Please, I have a process here.[overlapping chatter]

05:20.711 --> 05:22.887
This is much more complicated
than it seems.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.889
No. Wait, wait.
I found the winner.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.370
This one just graduated,
and she's a doctor.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.112
Mm. [laughs]Now I can stop googling
every time I sneeze.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.767
Did you say "just graduated"?

05:32.810 --> 05:35.204
Yeah.No, she probably still got
medical school loans.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.901
We can't let her
mess up our credit.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.903
That's a good point.Yeah, no, no.
We don't want...

05:38.947 --> 05:41.079
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Why don't you leave this

05:41.123 --> 05:42.777
to a professional? Yes?

05:42.820 --> 05:45.562
Yeah, Malcolm.
What you got over here?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.042
Let me see that.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.652
Wait, wait, wait.
What's wrong with her?

05:48.696 --> 05:50.262
What's wrong with her?

05:50.306 --> 05:51.655
What's wrong with you?

05:51.699 --> 05:53.396
What?Look at those ears.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.659
That's nothing that
a haircut can't fix.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.009
Uh, Ma, just because
Marty likes hobbits

05:58.053 --> 05:59.924
don't mean he
want to date one.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.578
TINA:
All right.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.363
Wait. This one
is not so bad.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.060
Okay.No. Look.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.062
Do you think we can get her
to trim her mustache?

06:07.105 --> 06:09.934
Oh...Suraya, do...?

06:09.978 --> 06:12.328
Suraya?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.592
Damn. Did Suraya leave
without saying goodbye?

06:15.636 --> 06:17.115
Well, that's just rude.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.512
How do I look?

06:22.556 --> 06:26.516
Like a steamy, hot cup of coffee
that just woke me up.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.735
[laughs]

06:27.778 --> 06:28.953
Ew.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.392
I decided to
turn the heat up

06:32.435 --> 06:34.394
a notch since we haven't had
a date night in a while.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.875
Well, I think
you broke the thermometer.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.966
Maybe you didn't hear me. Ew!

06:42.010 --> 06:44.752
[scoffs]

06:44.795 --> 06:46.884
I hope the sitter
gets here soon.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.496
The restaurant only gives
a 15-minute grace period.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.499
Well, you can go. Don't worry.
I'm old enough to watch myself.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.676
Just leave your credit card,
you know, for... emergencies.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.896
Oh, yeah, sure, and why don't
we leave the door open,

06:58.940 --> 07:00.898
and the keys on the table?

07:00.942 --> 07:02.596
And I'll unlock
the liquor cabinet, too.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.946
You could have just
said "no," Dad.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.949
[phone chimes]No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:07.992 --> 07:10.430
The sitter just
canceled!

07:10.473 --> 07:11.735
Donna? Why?

07:11.779 --> 07:13.955
Her boyfriend
broke up with her.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.914
Oh, not Troy.Uh-huh.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.004
He was the star
quarterback.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.397
Well, what happened?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.790
Something about them

07:22.833 --> 07:24.705
not spending
enough time together.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.968
Great! Let's have
a Monopoly marathon.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.057
I call the shoe!

07:30.014 --> 07:32.539
Ugh. I'm gonna
go put on my PJs.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.890
Yeah. I'll go unlock
the liquor cabinet.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.371
TINA:
Marty is going to be so upset.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.330
How do we tell him
that his matchmaker quit?

07:41.373 --> 07:43.506
I was going
to tell him like this.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.726
Marty, your matchmaker quit.

07:45.769 --> 07:46.944
[mutters]

07:47.989 --> 07:50.774
Wow, Pop.
You are all heart.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.689
Just full of compassion
over there.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.213
Look, I'm just saying,
back in my day,

07:55.257 --> 07:56.650
you didn't need
a matchmaker.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.566
If you liked a girl,
you told her friend.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.264
Her friend would let you
know if she liked you.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.744
Then, y'all would meet
at the lockers

08:03.787 --> 08:05.223
in the hallway
or something like that.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.444
What I'm saying is
that it was simple.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.882
[laughs]
Guys, I was just
on Suraya's website,

08:11.926 --> 08:14.755
and she has
a 99% success rate.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.453
I'm definitely bringing a
plus-one to my ten-year reunion,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.674
and I'm gonna have two kids
for my 20th. [laughs]

08:20.717 --> 08:24.373
[sniffing]
Mm. Mm. Y'all smell smoke?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.724
Tina...I'm gonna help Mama
put that fire out.

08:30.205 --> 08:33.643
You know, son,
it's, um, never wise

08:33.687 --> 08:35.776
to put all your faith
in one person.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.778
Oh, no. No,
you're right.Yeah.

08:37.821 --> 08:41.608
Which is why I'm only putting
99% of our faith in her, okay?

08:41.651 --> 08:45.481
Yeah. About that.
Um, Suraya-- she, uh...

08:45.525 --> 08:47.352
Did she find
my match already?

08:48.832 --> 08:51.879
Well, the truth is,
we haven't heard from her.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.533
Okay, well, I'll just
call her to check in.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.797
Okay, Marty, hold on.
Look, um,

08:56.840 --> 09:00.235
the honest truth is, she quit.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.542
What? Why?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.544
I don't know.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.284
Probably something
your mama said.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.765
You know her,
you know how she is.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.552
Yeah, well, I'll
never meet my girl.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.467
What are you talking about?

09:15.511 --> 09:17.339
Of course you will.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.080
Dad, you don't get it.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.169
You met Mom when you
were in your early 20s.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.564
You don't know what it's like
to be my age and still dating.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.392
I'm tired of getting dressed
up and paying for dinners

09:27.436 --> 09:29.481
for it all
to go nowhere.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.614
Well, son, I told you before,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.485
you should start
with coffee dates.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.966
Huh?

09:36.010 --> 09:38.882
Look, Marty, you're gonna
meet someone, all right?

09:38.926 --> 09:40.362
You're an amazing dude.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.756
Oh, yeah? Then why
am I still single,

09:42.799 --> 09:45.193
living with my brother,
next door to my parents?

09:45.236 --> 09:47.238
Damn.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.241
That sounds like
the saddest blues song ever.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.724
Well, I'm gonna
head home and

09:54.768 --> 09:56.291
get under my weighted blanket

09:56.334 --> 09:57.814
so I know what it feels
like to be cuddled.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.645
I was wrong.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.866
Thatsounded like
the saddest blues song ever.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.652
Oh.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.133
Well, how did Marty
take the news?Not well.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.656
Thanks.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.094
I think we're gonna have
to fill in for Suraya.

10:17.138 --> 10:21.185
Otherwise, in a few days, Marty
might be married to a blanket.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.107
What about two weeks
from Friday?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.153
Oh, we can't. We have
to meet our accountant.

10:32.196 --> 10:35.025
Ugh.What about the
Saturday after that?

10:35.069 --> 10:37.767
Grover's swim team
awards ceremony.Oh.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.769
Well, I guess we'll
just have to wait a month

10:39.813 --> 10:41.989
for our next date night.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.295
You know, I was
really looking forward

10:44.339 --> 10:46.341
to spending
some one-on-one time with you.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.300
I don't want to lose the spice
in our relationship.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.302
Ugh. Me, either,
but at this rate,

10:51.346 --> 10:52.695
we're not gonna have
a date night

10:52.739 --> 10:54.392
till after Grover goes
to college.

10:54.436 --> 10:57.526
Or the military,
'cause he's going somewhere.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.965
You know, maybe it's not
about planning alone time.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.706
Maybe it's about taking
advantage

11:03.750 --> 11:05.839
of the moments
that we do have together.

11:05.882 --> 11:09.581
Maybe. Oh, can you
grab some salsa?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.253
[speaking Spanish]

11:30.907 --> 11:33.301
[with Spanish accent]:
Are you alone?

11:33.344 --> 11:36.739
No, I'm with my husband.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.698
Dave, what are you doing?

11:38.741 --> 11:39.699
Dave? Who is this Dave?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.875
I have never heard
of any Dave.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.445
My name is Señor
Victor Gonzalez.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.274
[laughs quietly]

11:50.318 --> 11:53.016
And I am a spy who has
just met the hottest woman

11:53.060 --> 11:55.149
that I have ever seen
in my entire life.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.717
[laughs]

11:57.760 --> 12:00.850
And I heard you are
looking for some spice.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.852
[laughs]

12:02.896 --> 12:05.246
You're so silly, Dave.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.423
Dave? Again, I do not know
who this "Dave" is.

12:08.466 --> 12:11.034
You may call me Victor.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.342
And you are?

12:15.343 --> 12:17.954
I'm... Ginger.

12:19.086 --> 12:23.481
[British accent]:
I'm... Dr. Ginger Teagarten...

12:26.310 --> 12:28.704
...a brilliant archeologist,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.620
who's only in town
for one night

12:31.663 --> 12:36.059
before flying off to Egypt
in search of the...

12:36.103 --> 12:38.932
lost ark.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.546
Well, Dr. Teagarten,
I need to make sure

12:44.589 --> 12:46.722
that you are not stealing
government secrets.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.812
Oh.So I'm afraid I'm going
to need to, uh,

12:49.856 --> 12:52.075
strip-search you.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.254
But I only have 30 minutes

12:57.298 --> 13:02.607
before I'm expected
back at the... museum.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.436
This is not a problem,
Dr. Teagarten.
Oh?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.570
That is 25 more minutes
than I will need.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.267
Let's go.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.273
I don't know why
we're feeding all these people

13:16.317 --> 13:20.843
when the only woman that
matters is the one that I chose.

13:20.887 --> 13:24.064
We had to make it look like a
mixer, so the women don't know

13:24.107 --> 13:26.414
that they're here to compete
for a date with Marty.

13:26.457 --> 13:29.025
Um, and I think it's good that
he thinks he has lots of choices

13:29.069 --> 13:31.811
before he realizes
that my girl is best.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.988
Right, 'cause I'm sure
what Marty's looking for

13:35.031 --> 13:37.425
is a girl picked out
by his mama and daddy.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.472
Now, trust me,
the lady I selected--

13:41.516 --> 13:43.170
she gonna win, hands down.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.609
Oh, you look sharp.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.002
[laughs]

13:49.045 --> 13:51.308
Oh, look at you, baby.

13:51.352 --> 13:54.616
You look so extremely handsome,
except those eyebrows.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.574
I don't know what
is going on there.Okay. All right.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.011
Let me just put them...Okay, come on. No, no, no.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.491
I'm just trying
to hook him up.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.320
All right, son, there's
plenty of women here.Okay.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.974
All right, look around.Yeah. Okay.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.846
And then you make
your choice.Okay.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.849
Starting with that one.

14:11.676 --> 14:15.506
All right, I'm going in.
Wish me luck.Oh, yeah.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.031
[quietly]:
Tippy toe.

14:18.074 --> 14:21.861
I mean, they keep winning, but
they're not gaining any ground.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.863
I mean, the team
is hitting,

14:23.906 --> 14:25.865
but the problem
is the bullpen.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.954
And they need
to sit Jansen.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.607
His ERA is like a zip code.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.394
[laughs]
I-I have no idea
what any of that means.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.050
Give her a chance,
son, all right?

14:37.093 --> 14:39.226
She has season tickets
to the Dodgers.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.836
[clears throat]

14:40.880 --> 14:43.056
Well, Lindsey,

14:43.099 --> 14:45.406
I do hope they get those bulls
back in their pen.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.407
[both laugh]

14:46.450 --> 14:48.409
That was...

14:48.452 --> 14:50.628
You look a little thirsty.
There's a nice girl

14:50.672 --> 14:52.021
over by the punch bowl.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.893
Oh, actually,
is there some coconut water?

14:53.936 --> 14:56.417
Just go!

14:56.460 --> 14:59.724
So, "Pasadena's
only musical baker."

14:59.768 --> 15:01.030
What does that even mean?

15:01.074 --> 15:03.685
Well, let me show you.Oh, okay.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.775
♪ I add flour and butter
and sprinkle sugar on top ♪

15:06.818 --> 15:10.344
♪ Zing goes the oven
in my karaoke cake shop. ♪

15:10.387 --> 15:11.998
Yeah.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.830
Marty, meet Ariel.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.398
Well, I got to admit,
she is pretty.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.574
She all right.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.142
Ooh, here's the bachelor!

15:26.186 --> 15:27.970
Dope or nope?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.667
What do you think,
Ariel Nation?

15:29.711 --> 15:31.713
Leave your comments below.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.630
Girl, who are
you talking to?

15:35.673 --> 15:39.634
My 200,000 followers.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.202
Yes. Ariel is an influencer,
Okay?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.856
Yeah.[laughs]
Yeah.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.469
She's also a thrill seeker.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.558
She's bungee jumping
Yosemite Falls next week.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.603
Ah. You should come!

15:52.647 --> 15:53.909
Girl, I would love to.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.086
I mean, uh, you-you should go.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.480
Y-Yeah, 'cause that's how
this works.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.004
[Marty chuckles]

16:02.048 --> 16:04.093
Uh, uh, well,

16:04.137 --> 16:07.705
my two biggest fears are heights
and drowning, so no thanks.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.970
Oh. Uh, adventure sports are
a really big part of my life.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.972
Yeah, well, you know,

16:13.015 --> 16:15.235
I look both ways on
a one-way street. [laughs]

16:15.278 --> 16:17.063
Well, it was nice
meeting you.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.890
What? Uh...

16:20.631 --> 16:24.157
Well, I think Ariel is great,
okay? I would pick her.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.246
[clears throat] I mean,
he should pick her, okay?

16:26.289 --> 16:28.335
I'm-a go talk to him. Marty?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.598
Marty?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.121
Well, did he leave?

16:32.165 --> 16:35.211
People keep leaving
without saying "goodbye."

16:35.255 --> 16:37.039
It's rude.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.650
I'm starting to think
it's a societal issue.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.742
Grover is finally asleep.

16:44.786 --> 16:48.790
Honey, today
you have shown me two things.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.401
We'll never lose
our spice because

16:51.445 --> 16:53.316
you keep things interesting.[chuckles]

16:53.360 --> 16:57.233
And the backseat of our Prius
is way bigger than I thought.

16:58.495 --> 17:02.238
See? Aren't you glad we sprung
for the leather seats?Mm-hmm.

17:02.282 --> 17:06.851
Well, if you ever bump
into Victor Gonzales again,

17:06.895 --> 17:09.637
tell him he has an open invite

17:09.680 --> 17:12.466
to visit Dr. Ginger in Luxor.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.642
Really?

17:14.685 --> 17:16.122
Mm-hmm.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.211
I'll let him know.Good.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.998
[Spanish accent]:
Buenas noches, señorita.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.653
It is I, Victor Gonzalez.Mm.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.134
I have traveled
a great distance,

17:28.177 --> 17:31.485
but I'm afraid I must
strip-search you again.[gasps]

17:31.528 --> 17:33.095
[with accent]:
Again?

17:33.139 --> 17:35.750
Well, if you must, señor.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.274
Ooh, I must, Dr. Ginger.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.972
You see, you might be
smuggling contraband.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.974
Oh.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.151
Mom? Dad?Mm.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.633
I can't sleep.
Can I watch some TV?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.157
[with Spanish accent]:
Of course you can, but...

17:51.200 --> 17:53.289
[clears throat]

17:53.333 --> 17:55.813
[normal voice]: Come on, buddy.
Of course. Come sit down.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.469
All right.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.170
So, uh, who's Dr. Ginger?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.698
Marty, what are you
doing out here?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.613
[sighs]

18:12.656 --> 18:16.138
Mama, I don't have anything in
common with any of those girls.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.532
Baby, we're sorry.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.274
We just wanted to help
you find a great match.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.537
Yeah, well, you did.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.843
We did? Which one?

18:25.887 --> 18:28.977
No, I meant, you found the
perfect matches for yourselves.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.242
Lindsey is into the
Dodgers, like Dad.

18:33.286 --> 18:36.332
And Denise is into singing
and baking, like Mom.

18:36.376 --> 18:40.249
And Ariel is really
into Malcolm.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.079
TINA:
You know,

18:44.123 --> 18:46.212
baby, you're right.
We were too focused

18:46.255 --> 18:48.953
on looking for the qualities
that we like.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.521
Yeah. Instead of those
that appeal to you.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.307
Yeah, well, on the bright side,

18:54.350 --> 18:56.831
you did help me figure
out what I don't want.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.661
You know, sure, it would be nice
to take someone to my reunion,

19:00.704 --> 19:05.448
but after tonight, I realize...

19:05.492 --> 19:07.972
I want what you two have.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.585
And instead of rushing it,
I'm... I'm willing

19:11.628 --> 19:13.543
to wait until I find
the right girl.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.242
Well, you do that, you know,
because I get it now, you know?

19:16.285 --> 19:19.114
These little heifers out here
are something else.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.986
Ah.Yeah.

19:22.030 --> 19:27.296
But what I do know-- when
that special someone finds you,

19:27.340 --> 19:30.908
she is going to be
a very lucky woman.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.562
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.826
[laughs softly]Don't worry, son.
She's out there.

19:35.870 --> 19:36.871
Just not in that car.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.755
Hmm.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.671
[with New York accent]:
Uh... pardon me.

19:56.456 --> 19:59.720
You are one
of the most attractive women

19:59.763 --> 20:02.331
that I have ever seen
in my entire life.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.291
Do I know you?

20:06.292 --> 20:08.381
You do not.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.167
But your mother's
gonna love me.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.953
Well, thank you, but
I've got to get to court.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.304
I've got a big case to try.

20:18.347 --> 20:22.786
Wow. Uh, wicked.
You're a lawyer?Mm.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.049
'Cause I got a record.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.749
Okay, Dave, this isn't working
for me. Go back to Victor.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.404
Okay, all right, um...

20:36.887 --> 20:40.239
[with Spanish accent]:
Buenas noches, señorita.

20:40.282 --> 20:43.416
Victor Gonzalez
never strays

20:43.459 --> 20:46.288
too far away.Mm.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.596
I will see you in the car.Okay.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.772
Ooh. Un momento.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.341
Dave, eggs aren't sexy.[normal voice]:
No, I know.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.125
We're out. I need
them for the morning.Oh.
