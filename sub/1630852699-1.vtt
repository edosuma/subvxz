00:53.303 --> 00:57.182
<i>My husband</i>
<i>told me I have an overactive imagination.</i>

00:57.682 --> 00:59.142
<i>That I drink too much.</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:01.853
<i>That I can't let go of the past.</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:04.606
<i>That I make plans and cancel them.</i>

01:05.356 --> 01:08.610
<i>That I never wear a jacket</i>
<i>but then complain that I'm cold.</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:11.613
<i>That sometimes</i>
<i>I speak with a British accent</i>

01:11.696 --> 01:13.239
<i>even though I'm not British.</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:16.701
<i>He's right,</i>
<i>about all of it.</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
<i>That's why he left me.</i>

01:51.945 --> 01:53.113
Shit.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.740
Elizabeth?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.535
Honey, we're gonna be late for school!

02:01.579 --> 02:04.082
<i>We tell children so many lies.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:05.959
<i>Not to worry,</i>

02:06.876 --> 02:08.211
<i>not to be afraid,</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:10.839
<i>not to believe in monsters.</i>

02:12.257 --> 02:14.134
<i>But why don't we tell them the truth?</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.803
<i>There are monsters.</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:19.430
<i>They're just not under the bed.</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:27.605
Anna.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.315
Hi, Carol.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.109
How are you?

02:31.192 --> 02:32.068
Good.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.820
Yeah?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.366
Morning got away from me.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.743
Mark said
you never called him back to confirm.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.580
For the date tonight.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.417
Yeah. I don't… I don't know
if tonight is gonna work.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
Oh, Anna. You can't cancel the day of.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.254
He's a big client of Scott's.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.424
Plus, it's been three years.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.343
At some point, you gotta move on. Right?

02:57.927 --> 03:00.722
I know I have to.
I just… I don't know how.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.516
You put on a dress, you do your makeup.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.602
You're too cute to be sad forever.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.645
Okay. So you're good to go?

03:09.314 --> 03:12.275
-Yeah, Carol. Good to go.
-Great. I'll tell Scott to let him know.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.154
Tell Mark Anna's in. Period.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.198
Also, your shirts are in my car.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.950
Should I take them to the cleaners
or what? Question mark.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.670
How's the mailbox coming, Buell?

03:33.254 --> 03:35.131
It's coming, Miss Anna.
She's a tricky one,

03:35.215 --> 03:36.674
but we're getting there. Don't worry.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.880
Same four photos.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.219
Well, at least I'm not the only one
that hasn't moved on.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.684
We were so happy once.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.541
Guys, do you have
a, um… a box with "Emma"?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.085
Yeah. Great.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.545
Okay.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.298
Here we go.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.593
Okay.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.395
No wife?

05:16.441 --> 05:19.527
<i> Hi.</i>
<i>You've reached the Whitaker residence.</i>

05:21.446 --> 05:23.364
<i> Anna Banana, it's Sloane.</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:26.784
<i> I don't know if you even listen</i>
<i>to this anymore, but your mailbox is full.</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:28.369
<i>I haven't heard from you in a few days.</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:31.706
I'm a little worried.
I know you told me not to worry,

05:31.789 --> 05:33.166
and so I'm not gonna worry.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.251
But call me back,
or I will definitely worry.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.129
<i>Now for the annoying part of the message.</i>

05:38.212 --> 05:41.215
I know you told me a million times
that you stopped painting…

05:41.299 --> 05:43.426
…and you can totally say no.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.929
But I have a show coming up,
and I need one of your pieces.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.848
Not need but want.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.309
But also need. But also no pressure.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.769
But also, please?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.979
Okay, I hate myself. I love you.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.439
Call me back.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.621
I was so talented once.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.801
How do I look?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.220
You think Carol would approve?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.098
I know.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.435
I wish I was in my pajamas
staying home with you tonight too.

06:38.773 --> 06:39.732
I love you.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.574
Can you at least give me a kiss
before I go?

06:49.909 --> 06:50.910
I can't.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.036
Why not?

06:52.620 --> 06:53.913
Because I'm dead.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.339
How do I keep forgetting that?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.056
<i>When your past is so present,</i>

07:12.140 --> 07:13.891
<i>how can there be a future?</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:15.560
<i>There can't.</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:19.647
<i>You're just stuck in the present</i>
<i>with your past.</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
<i> Oh my God.</i>
<i>I cannot believe you just stood Mark up.</i>

07:32.577 --> 07:35.746
<i>This is really bad for Scott, Anna.</i>
<i>You don't even--</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:53.431
You gotta be kidding me.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.106
Hello?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.434
I need a fucking drink.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.316
Ugh.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
Not tagged.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.535
Oh shit.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.665
Hi.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.833
These are for you.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.210
Oh my God.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.255
They're gorgeous. Thank you.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.010
So… sorry. They're not, um…
They're not from me.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.597
They were delivered a while ago.
They were just sitting out in the sun, so…

09:57.680 --> 09:58.764
Right. No. I know.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.476
I… That's why I was saying thank you
for letting me know they're out here.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.769
That's why I said, "Thank you."

10:04.895 --> 10:07.815
I'm Neil.
Um, we just moved in across the street.

10:07.898 --> 10:08.941
Did you?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.401
Huh.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.944
Um, I'm Anna.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.451
Uh… uh…

10:18.534 --> 10:20.578
Well, uh, enjoy your flowers.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.163
Okay.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.664
Very pretty.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.895
What else can I tell you?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.772
Hmm. Oh, we have new neighbors.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.816
A dad and a little girl.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.818
She's about your age.

10:53.694 --> 10:57.031
Or the age you were when…

11:00.785 --> 11:02.244
All right. I gotta go.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.455
I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.348
Hi.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.685
You must be my new neighbor.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.520
I'm Anna.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.646
My name's Emma.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.774
What you got there?

11:32.441 --> 11:34.485
I'm selling chocolate bars
for my new school.

11:34.568 --> 11:38.823
I'm trying to sell as many as I can
so that the other kids will like me.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.825
How about five boxes?

11:40.908 --> 11:43.160
Wow. That's $50.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.037
Fifty dollars. Okay.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.458
Stay right here. I'm gonna go upstairs
and get my checkbook.

11:54.672 --> 11:59.051
You know, you must have read my mind,
'cause I was just craving chocolate.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.638
Okay…

12:04.557 --> 12:06.767
So how are you liking your new house?

12:06.851 --> 12:09.228
My dad says the kitchen's too small.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.479
Is that so?

12:11.522 --> 12:15.192
Is, um, your dad a… a good cook?

12:15.276 --> 12:17.570
Not as good as my mom was.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.615
She died.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.119
I'm sorry.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.833
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I am going to bring you

12:30.916 --> 12:33.127
a yummy chicken casserole
for dinner tonight.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.128
Really?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.045
Mm-hmm.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.799
-Do I make the check out to your school?
-Yeah.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.260
Madison Elementary.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.389
That was Elizabeth's school.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.016
Who's Elizabeth?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.143
Uh…

12:51.896 --> 12:53.522
Someone very special.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.691
Just like you.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.862
What kind do you want?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.781
Do you have anything with almonds?

13:01.864 --> 13:06.744
Oh, the lady next door to us
bought all the almond ones.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.790
Is she not nice?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.416
Oh, no. She's n… nice.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.126
She didn't really seem nice.

13:15.044 --> 13:15.878
I like you.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.388
How do I keep forgetting that?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.681
Hey. Hey, you okay?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.523
Oh.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.440
You all right?

14:18.524 --> 14:21.485
Yeah. I'm okay. Oh God. I'm so sorry.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.488
-Do you want me to call someone?
-No. No. I'm fine.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.868
Uh, I'm just embarrassed.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.785
What?

14:30.286 --> 14:34.707
It's my stupid ombrophobia.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.168
Fear of the rain.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Oh.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.506
I was trying
to bring you a casserole.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.634
You didn't need to do that.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.928
Although actually,
I bet Emma would've loved it.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.639
Don't think she likes my cooking
anywhere near as much as her mom's.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.059
Yeah.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.686
She told me

14:57.229 --> 14:58.647
that your wife passed.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.734
Did she?

15:02.610 --> 15:03.444
Yeah.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.447
Yeah, um…

15:07.865 --> 15:11.327
It was a tragic accident.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.914
We were, um, up at our lake house,

15:14.997 --> 15:17.583
and she drowned.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.796
Emma saw the whole thing.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.841
That's awful.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.217
Yeah.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.348
My daughter died…

15:35.643 --> 15:36.810
…three years ago.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.106
Jesus.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.495
Those are beautiful.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.038
Oh, thank you.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.375
Sorry-- Wait, you painted those?

15:59.458 --> 16:00.501
Mm-hmm.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.962
Wow.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.422
Wow.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.633
My wife was really into art.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.302
She took pottery classes forever,

16:11.428 --> 16:15.224
but I mean, she wasn't
like a professional, like you.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.935
Haven't painted in a long time.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.812
Yeah. Well,

16:21.105 --> 16:22.815
grief can really derail things.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.528
Yeah.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.115
-Do you want a cup of coffee?
-Yeah, no.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.075
-I should probably get back to Emma.
-Right.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.411
But I'd love to take you up
on the offer some other time.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.328
Great.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.540
Uh, I can't thank you enough.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.166
-Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
-Yes.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.251
-Great.
-Yeah.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.879
And I am gonna bring you
another casserole.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.047
Only if you insist.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.342
And listen, we're literally
right across the street,

16:50.426 --> 16:51.844
so if there's anything you need…

16:52.344 --> 16:53.929
Thanks.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.186
This is totally unsolicited advice.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.107
I think you should paint again.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.193
You're too good.

17:12.990 --> 17:13.824
Okay.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.174
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.718
Oh my God.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.854
<i>There's so many layers</i>
<i>to casseroles,</i>

21:12.938 --> 21:15.565
<i>just like there are so many layers</i>
<i>to a person.</i>

21:15.649 --> 21:17.567
<i>But to connect with someone,</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.445
<i>you have to be willing</i>
<i>to peel back those layers</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:23.365
<i>and show them what's really inside.</i>

21:25.450 --> 21:26.493
Hi.

21:27.077 --> 21:27.911
Hi.

21:27.995 --> 21:28.829
Casserole.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.747
I told you I'd make it.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.000
-You look pretty.
-I do?

21:33.917 --> 21:36.003
-Hi, Anna.
Hi.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.755
Oh. Gee. You really…
you brought us another casserole?

21:38.839 --> 21:41.008
No. I saw
that this one had been delivered,

21:41.091 --> 21:43.468
and it was just sitting out
in the sun. So…

21:43.969 --> 21:44.803
Oh.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.514
Yeah, I'm kidding. I made it.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.725
Um, I hope you guys enjoy it.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.602
Do you, um…

21:53.395 --> 21:54.938
Do you wanna stay and join us?

21:57.274 --> 21:58.859
Oh, uh…

21:58.942 --> 22:01.653
I mean, I've opened a bottle of wine.
Don't know if you like wine.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.654
I like wine.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.489
Great. Great. Come in.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.927
Oh, Dad?
My class is going on a field trip.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.679
Can you be the chaperone?

22:28.889 --> 22:29.723
Hmm.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.477
What do you think?

22:36.396 --> 22:38.398
Oh. Emma, I forgot to tell you.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.276
Anna is an artist.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.364
-Can I show you a drawing I did?
-Yes, please.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.452
-Can you grab that permission slip?
-Yep. I'll get it.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.455
Her mom used to chaperone
all the field trips,

22:53.538 --> 22:55.040
so now I try and make sure I do it.

22:55.123 --> 22:55.957
Hmm.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.586
You're obviously doing
a really great job with her.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.046
I'm trying.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.137
Okay. One permission slip

23:09.638 --> 23:10.806
and my duck.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.766
Wow.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.768
Emma, this is fabulous.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.020
Thanks.
Ducks are my favorite animal.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.816
-I wanted this to be more light green.
-Hmm.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.818
But my marker set
doesn't have light green.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.486
Hmm.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.823
Now, I think it is somebody's bedtime.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.074
No.

23:29.157 --> 23:29.991
Yes.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.035
It's all right.
I should probably be going as well.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.037
-Can you read to me?
-Sure.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.164
Let me do the dishes.
I'll meet you upstairs.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.290
That'll take forever.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.250
Emma…

23:38.333 --> 23:39.292
I can read to you.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.797
I… I mean, if that's okay.

23:45.590 --> 23:46.842
Please.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.220
You sure you don't mind?

23:52.305 --> 23:53.390
I'd love to.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.565
-You've got a good one up there.
-Yeah.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.316
Yeah. I'm pretty lucky.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.027
I, um,

24:07.529 --> 24:08.947
cleaned your casserole dish.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.991
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.368
Well, I didn't do
that good a job, to be honest. Look.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.162
Couldn't get rid of that part.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.915
You know, I think that was already there.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.718
Well…

24:31.428 --> 24:32.596
…it's a gorgeous dish.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.396
-Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.856
It's okay. I have more.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.858
It's fine. It's totally ok…

24:50.155 --> 24:51.573
I should probably get going.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.743
Well, thank you.

24:56.036 --> 24:56.870
Yeah.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.416
For everything.

25:50.090 --> 25:54.469
<i>I've gotten so used to nightmares</i>
<i>I almost forgot what it's like to dream.</i>

25:58.765 --> 26:02.227
<i>To dream of a future</i>
<i>where I'm no longer alone.</i>

26:04.062 --> 26:06.731
<i>A future where I can trust someone again.</i>

26:09.693 --> 26:11.486
<i>A future where monsters</i>

26:12.529 --> 26:13.738
<i>don't exist.</i>

28:06.184 --> 28:07.185
