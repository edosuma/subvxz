00:23.080 --> 00:26.600
[Cornelia] Without you,
I'd have been killed...

00:27.840 --> 00:29.040
right at the start.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.280
That's how we met.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.760
That's why we met.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.080
It was in the stars.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.560
And we believed in the stars.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.040
You and I.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.400
Out there, back then,

01:05.640 --> 01:08.200
it didn't matter where we came from,

01:08.280 --> 01:10.080
Europe or Russia.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.560
Since Plymouth Rock,
to you we were all just the same.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.200
We were all just...

01:18.280 --> 01:19.720
The English.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.240
It's funny then,
that after all these years,

01:29.320 --> 01:32.440
I only have one word left.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.000
A Pawnee word.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.440
Your word...

01:39.240 --> 01:41.600
SOUTHAMPTON

01:45.800 --> 01:48.320
[Cornelia] "I cherish you."

01:51.920 --> 01:53.560
[Cornelia] And in between...

01:56.120 --> 02:01.280
I wanted to kill a man
for the murder of my child.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.000
You wanted back your land...

02:06.080 --> 02:08.160
stolen from you.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.480
But the difference between what we want...

02:16.120 --> 02:18.240
and what we need,

02:22.320 --> 02:25.440
well, that was something we both...

02:27.880 --> 02:29.520
had yet to learn.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.920
It was us said
we'd do the same to him some day.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.840
'Cept now I gone
and clean blown his face off.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.880
S'okay.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.720
Got us a couple of spares.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.600
What we just done.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.360
Do it again
if you care to look the other way.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.080

04:40.160 --> 04:43.160
[dramatic music playing]

04:49.880 --> 04:51.080
Not today.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.360
Says who?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.080
[Eli] Says me.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.160
[Scott] How so?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.160
It's my last.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.320
[Captain Grann] Right, round her up
and get her out of here.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.880
How's that you kill one, follow another?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.560
Something like.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.480
I'm sorry about yesterday.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.320
But he had it coming.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.960
-Long time.
-Yes, sir.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.680
Lonnie and me, we was 16.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.400
Joined up greenhorns together.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.040
What they did to him...

07:01.120 --> 07:02.720
that could've been me.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.920
Coulda been...

07:05.840 --> 07:07.440
Could've been any of us.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.440
How long you been in?

07:11.520 --> 07:12.880
Longer than you.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.120
[Cam] What you gonna do now?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.440

-Back to your Res?

07:23.200 --> 07:24.800
-The Loup.
-Why?

07:24.880 --> 07:25.880
Born there.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.040
[Cam] But that ain't Pawnee land no more.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.240
[Eli] Don't want it all, just a few acres.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.280
[Cam] Which they won't give you.

may make a claim.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.840
I intend to.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.680
[Cam] Smoke dreams for the fireside.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.640
Lonnie's brother, Billy Myers.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.000
Remember him?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.560
[Eli] Uh-hmm.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.600
[Cam] I hear he's up there.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.800
-[Eli] Nebraska?
-Wyoming.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.760
Caine County or some such.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.920
You might wanna look him up.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.840
Ain't looking to.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.000
[Cam] But if you do,
you tell him we finally got him.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.240
We finally got Lonnie's killer.

so bloody fast?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.160
Because I told him to.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.680
Why?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.120
-Indians.
-Like I said.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.840
What, what Indians?

12:06.920 --> 12:09.280
-Ghost dancers.
-Like I said.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.840
Dancing Indians...

12:11.520 --> 12:13.560
that's something to be afraid of?

12:13.640 --> 12:15.080
It is when they stop.

[Richard] Well, now you can.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.240
What did he do?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.240
Drew!

12:36.320 --> 12:38.040
What'd he do?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.720
[Drew] I don't know, Mr. Watts.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.680
What did the shit-sniffer do?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.000
[Richard] I'll tell you what he did.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.920
He walked straight into my hotel
and he asked me for a drink.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.600
That's what he did.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.480
Even said please, as I recall.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.560
No, ma'am, you don't have
to mark him down for his manners,

12:57.600 --> 12:59.480
just the color of his skin.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.920
Who beat him?

[Cornelia] No.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.240
Nothing you can do.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.240
Because I'm a woman?

13:59.560 --> 14:01.440
Not your fight.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.240
Don't pick it.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.640
I'll give you ten dollars to cut him down.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.360
Ten dollars to clean him up
and then ten more to see him on his way.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.440
Lot of money.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.120
And by the look of things, you need it.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.960
I'm not unversed
in matters of business, sir,

14:26.040 --> 14:27.360
so be aware I am not...

14:28.040 --> 14:29.680
the haggling type.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.320
Oh, I'm not about to haggle
with you, ma'am.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.080
Then we are agreed.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.640
I'm just waiting for the full extent
of your parlous situation

15:34.680 --> 15:35.920
You're leaving.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.640
[Eli] Where?

15:39.720 --> 15:42.200
[Richard] Back to Ellsworth.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.720
I didn't come from Ellsworth.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.480
That's as close to Hell as I can think of.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.640
You walk?

15:51.600 --> 15:54.000
-To my horse.
-Oh, no.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.320
To him.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.720
My bag?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.200
Payment for the ride.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.400
You already got my horse.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.480
And I can get me 25 for a scalp.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.240

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
I seen it.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.080
Been with us a while.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.240
[Sebold] Damn it.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.320
Why is it you people
always got to see things first?

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
I saw it too!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.680
Maybe I didn't get the need to say it.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.440
It's us they want?

18:28.560 --> 18:29.560
Uh-hmm.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.800
Well, we ain't never gonna outrun them.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.480
Whoa!

18:50.040 --> 18:52.680
Shouldn't never have agreed
to that turnaround.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.040
Why did you?

18:57.160 --> 18:58.560
Indians?

18:59.680 --> 19:03.040
[Eli] If they are,
go easier on you if you take these off.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.560
Nice try.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.760
You a scout?

19:12.800 --> 19:13.880
Was.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.320
You ain't no Apache, Pawnee then.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
I've walked with the Pawnee.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.200
-What name do you go by?
-Eli Whipp.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.680
[Sebold] No, fool.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.240
Pawnee name.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.280
Ckirirahpiks.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.320
"Wolf...

19:32.680 --> 19:33.920
Wounded."

19:34.000 --> 19:35.520
When you get given that?

19:37.320 --> 19:38.320
Massacre Canyon.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.640
[Sebold] Hell, yeah, against the Sioux?

19:42.160 --> 19:46.560
So, tell me,
which Indian is it you actually do like,

19:47.640 --> 19:49.800
seeing as you seem to fight
against them all?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
We had enemies long before you turned up.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.960
And the good gumption
to choose our side when we did!

19:57.040 --> 20:01.240
Not so clever though on reckoning
we'd end up doing the same to you!

20:01.320 --> 20:04.520
Less Wounded Wolf than Whipped Dog,

20:04.560 --> 20:06.080
wouldn't you say?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.720
That how you come by your English name?

20:13.160 --> 20:15.880
Never say how
a thing's gonna turn out 'til it does.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.760
They ain't Indians.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.480

They're still trouble.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.800
Bit of a home inventor.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.800
You tried before?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.200
Nope!

20:46.280 --> 20:47.560
Yes, sir!

20:47.640 --> 20:50.760
One way or another,
gonna show him some balls.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.800
[suspenseful music playing]

21:02.240 --> 21:03.440
Oh, Hell.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.240
My enemy's enemy.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.200
You Pawnee sure know a thing about that.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.920
[dramatic music playing]

21:19.520 --> 21:21.560
-How many rounds?
-[Sebold] Ten.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.440
Spent two on a jack-rabbit.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.560
Then you missed.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.080
Yes, I did.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.320
[dramatic music playing]

21:56.520 --> 21:57.600
Friends?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.120
Where're you headed?

22:01.200 --> 22:02.360
Ellsworth.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.760
[spits]

22:05.840 --> 22:07.360
Late for Ellsworth.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.200
Starting to feel that way.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.440
-What you doing with him?
-Taking him in.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.680
What for?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.040
Killing a woman.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.760
English woman.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.200
Eh, don't look like you're taking him in.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.680
[Sebold] See, Sir, uh,
I wasn't sure who you was

22:25.760 --> 22:28.280
and I thought to have all the help
I can get.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.800
We'll take him.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.960
-Where?
-Nearest tree.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.680
You too, you get in our way.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.000
[Sebold] Well, now I...
I was looking to get a reward.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.440
Dead Indian's the best you're gonna get.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.600
I didn't kill no English woman.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.840
Didn't need to.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.920
I'm happy to do it here.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.560
Wait a moment now!

22:53.360 --> 22:57.000
This is a commercial business! Huh!

22:57.080 --> 23:01.280
I can't have you spreading him
all over my prime asset.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.720
-Shouldn't have picked him up.
-You're on horseback, I'm up here.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.240
Odds sit with me.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.480
[lead horseman] Hmm, you think?

23:11.440 --> 23:14.720
Come to bets, boy, it's three to one.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.080
What d'you say?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.120
[lead horseman] I said...

23:20.040 --> 23:21.360
it's...

23:21.440 --> 23:22.840
three...

23:25.080 --> 23:26.040
to...

23:31.320 --> 23:32.920
-one.
-I'll take it.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.360
-Oh, Hell!
-[gunfire]

23:34.440 --> 23:36.160
[horse neighs]

23:36.240 --> 23:38.040
-[gun cocks]
-[gunfire]

23:38.120 --> 23:39.800
-[gun cocks]
-[gunfire]

23:39.880 --> 23:41.480
-[gun cocks]
-[gunfire]

23:42.480 --> 23:45.480
[dramatic music playing]

24:08.320 --> 24:12.520
Well, I am certainly pleased with that!

24:12.600 --> 24:14.080
That woman really dead?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.240
Will be.

24:16.320 --> 24:20.240
-And you were gonna pin it on me?
-[Sebold] Well, that was the plan.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.360
Well, I didn't know you like I do now.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.720
[groans]

24:34.440 --> 24:35.960
That's gonna kill you.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.240
At least I've got time to think about it.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.120
"Deborah Crawford"...

24:51.400 --> 24:53.640
where in the Hell did that name come from?

25:01.760 --> 25:04.160
[Sebold] Hmm, you're right.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.680
[grunts]

25:07.400 --> 25:09.200
[gun clicks]

25:09.280 --> 25:11.880
Maybe somethings're
better left forgotten.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.240
[dramatic music playing]

25:25.040 --> 25:26.360
[gunfire]

25:26.440 --> 25:29.440
[dramatic music playing]

25:38.200 --> 25:41.200
[instrumental music playing]

25:59.760 --> 26:02.440
[Richard] This light, that dress,

26:02.520 --> 26:03.960
you remind me of my wife.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.800
But not the bleeding?

26:08.880 --> 26:10.480
That too.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.320
Where is she?

26:13.400 --> 26:15.880
You looking to plead your case
to a better angel?

26:15.960 --> 26:19.360
-I don't have a case.
-I don't have a wife.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.000
You're gonna kill me.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.880
[exhales deeply]

26:33.600 --> 26:36.600
[crying]

26:44.560 --> 26:46.400
I'm not-- I'm not--

26:46.480 --> 26:50.680
I am but I'm not for the reasons
that you think.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.280
[sniffles]

26:52.360 --> 26:53.880
I'm...

26:53.960 --> 26:57.840
I'm just so... angry.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.040
[Richard] Yup.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.360
But can't help but wonder on the cause.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.880
Someone killed my child.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.080
-Ah...
-And now I'm gonna kill him.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.480
Were.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.360
Actually, not even then.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.640
Not now, not then, not ever.

27:31.320 --> 27:36.280
Because that's the kind of man he is.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.640
How did he know?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Ain't no tremor he can't feel.

28:01.320 --> 28:05.680
Sometimes I think he dug
that mind of his so deep,

28:05.760 --> 28:09.640
Devil just skipped out,
jumped straight into his heart.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.360
Certainly that's how I learnt
to get so light on my feet.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.480
You surely didn't hear me, now did you?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.320
-Where?
-Everywhere.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.720
I had so many choices.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.520
And I surely question Southampton?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.560
Oh, it was closest.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.800
Liverpool's quicker, every time.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.440
Still, Havana must've been a pleasant jig.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.400
New Orleans.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.280
Noticed you cut out St Louis;
shame, they got a bridge down there,

28:48.360 --> 28:49.760
it's quite the marvel.

28:51.360 --> 28:56.760
Oh, my, gadding about
with all that unbanked cash,

28:56.840 --> 28:59.960
like dragging a stink-line for a skunk.

29:00.920 --> 29:05.880
Couple of times we had to intervene
on your imminent demise.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.120
Why bother?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.960
He wanted journey's end here.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.680
We're in the middle of nowhere.

29:17.760 --> 29:21.000
The real America.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.440
Maybe see if I can't plant
a cottonwood, or some such,

29:24.520 --> 29:27.040
on top of you, make you a part of it.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.400
If it's any consolation,

29:30.480 --> 29:31.800
I hate him too.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.400
Profit or loss,

29:35.480 --> 29:38.360
there's nothing he don't think
sits either side of a ledger.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.000
You'll be in there somewhere.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.080
Know I am.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.880
From the Saville Row suit
to the Burlington Brogues.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.680
He has me gussied up
like a punked arse come Sunday prayers.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.360
And I hate him for it.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.920
Yes, ma'am, I do.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.360
Let me go.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.960
[Richard] In truth,

30:05.040 --> 30:07.680
I've mostly learnt to absorb
my belittlement...

30:09.200 --> 30:12.120
confine my thoughts merely to my contract,

30:12.200 --> 30:16.720
a contract which,
despite its sulfurous stink,

30:16.800 --> 30:20.160
I find myself quite willing to uphold.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.800
That is, bar, the odd hidden cost.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.560
I get them from time to time.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.840
Just give me a chance to spit in the soup.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.760
Pathetic really, but there you go;

30:36.800 --> 30:38.760
what else is left to the humbled servant?

30:42.760 --> 30:44.320
You want to rape me?

30:45.480 --> 30:49.160
I'm realistic
when it comes to issues of consent.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.600
Then fuck a horse.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.360
Useful thought.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.000
What with the nights' drawing in.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.920
Prairie oysters.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.680
I'm gonna kill you.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.240
They really are very good.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.520
Not now.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.640
Not then. But...

31:31.720 --> 31:33.640
but I will.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.600
You'll have to come back
from the dead to do it.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.480
I will.

31:41.280 --> 31:46.280
Then, uh, might you consider
coming back as my horse?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.800
[cheerful music playing]

32:13.200 --> 32:14.680
[exhales]

32:19.040 --> 32:20.760
Mind the big ones.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.520
Not quite the woman I expected.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.040
You're everything I'd expect of a man.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.400
[gasps]

33:25.600 --> 33:28.600
[groaning]

33:37.240 --> 33:38.680

33:49.560 --> 33:52.560
[dramatic music playing]

34:01.720 --> 34:04.720
[squeezebox music playing]

34:09.680 --> 34:11.000
[music stops]

34:11.080 --> 34:12.280
Keep playing.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.160
You run, I'll stalk you down.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.640
It was my job.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.480
[music continues]

34:24.760 --> 34:26.080
Where's the other one?

34:26.160 --> 34:27.280
Let's just leave.

34:29.640 --> 34:30.880
Didn't come back for you.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.560
[snoring]

34:41.360 --> 34:42.480
Huh?

34:42.920 --> 34:45.040
[Cornelia] Someone wants to see you.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.680
-Who?
-Him.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.960
[indistinct shouting]

34:53.560 --> 34:54.560
[Drew] No!

34:54.640 --> 34:56.320
No, no, no.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.400
[Drew sobbing]

35:02.960 --> 35:05.960
[Drew groaning]

35:15.280 --> 35:16.320
My bag.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.600
-[Drew] What?
-Where is it?

35:18.640 --> 35:23.440
Uh, I-- Box, uh, boss.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.160
Keep him stood.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.480
[squeezebox music playing]

35:38.480 --> 35:40.560
Can I... Can I stop playing now?

35:41.440 --> 35:42.440
[Eli] No.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.320
My fingers, they gone all bubbly.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.320
[dramatic music playing]

36:50.320 --> 36:53.520
A Baptist, when I was a boy,
gave me my white name.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.520
Eli Whipp.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.160
Wanna know why?

36:59.760 --> 37:00.760
I'm good with rope.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.360
You called me "Shit sniffer".

37:04.440 --> 37:05.520
[Drew] Did I?

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
Weren't my name.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.440
Maybe that's one for you to wear.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.400
Please.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.440
Oh, I ain't gonna kill you.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.040
Let the horse decide.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.760
See if you gave him enough to drink.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.640
Let him go.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.600
[Drew] No.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.600
[Drew sobbing]

38:21.040 --> 38:24.560
[water bubbling, splashing]

38:44.160 --> 38:45.280
Huh.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.160
That was...

39:12.120 --> 39:13.960
That was-- Thank you.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
[Eli] For what?

39:16.080 --> 39:19.920
[Cornelia] Well, if you hadn't come
they were going to...

39:20.680 --> 39:22.200
[Eli] Your business, not mine.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.120
Ah, but then it became yours,
so thank you.

39:25.640 --> 39:26.960
And now it's not.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.840
Is that what you came back for?

39:33.520 --> 39:34.920
-[Eli] Hmm?
-Your horse.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.840
And this.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.680
[Cornelia] What's in it?

39:41.400 --> 39:42.440
Medicine.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.640
You ill?

39:44.400 --> 39:45.640
[Eli] Only without it.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.120
Ah, magic.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.840
Not a trick.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.360
Oh no, no, I didn't say it was.

39:53.440 --> 39:57.400
You see, this is--
this is a lock of my son's hair.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.200
-Powerful.
-[Cornelia] Yes.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.520
It got me this far.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.800
And now I've met you.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.200
I'm leaving.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
So...

40:08.840 --> 40:11.040
So, what do I do?

40:12.400 --> 40:13.760
Take your pick.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
The one I rode in on's pretty good.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.760
What about my things?

40:18.640 --> 40:19.880
[Eli] Take what you need.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.000
I need everything.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.160
Difference between what you need
and what you want

40:25.280 --> 40:27.120
is what you can put on a horse.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.680
Where are you going?

40:32.200 --> 40:33.320
North.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.160
[Cornelia] Would you like to know
where I'm going?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.080
-No.
-I'm going West!

40:37.160 --> 40:39.600
Caine County, Powder River. Wyoming.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.800
That's North.

40:42.680 --> 40:43.800
Oh.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.560
[Eli] A month's ride, at least.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.600
Your voice, English?

40:49.640 --> 40:50.680
[Cornelia] Yes.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.400
Go back to English.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.120
Oh no, I can't do that.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.200
[Eli] Up to you.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.760
They know you got that?

41:08.280 --> 41:09.600
And now you won't make ten miles.

41:09.640 --> 41:14.160
It cannot be that this whole country's
only full of killers and thieves.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.360
Look, will you help me?

41:17.440 --> 41:18.960
-No.
-[Cornelia] Please!

41:19.040 --> 41:20.080
I got what I came for.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.560
No, I don't believe
you came back just for that.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.480
I backed up that horse!

41:28.520 --> 41:29.600
Woulda happened anyway.

41:29.640 --> 41:30.920
But I did it!

41:32.160 --> 41:34.440
-[Eli] Your choice.
-What about this afternoon?

41:34.520 --> 41:37.440
It wasn't your fight, this isn't mine.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.320
No.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.680
I mean that we're here at all.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.640
When only this afternoon
you were tied up there,

41:44.760 --> 41:46.160
I was lying down over there,

41:46.280 --> 41:48.680
both about to get killed
and yet here we are.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.000
And it's everyone else that's dead.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.320
Like it was magic.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.800
Like it is magic!

42:00.120 --> 42:02.880
You did not just come back for that bag.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.200
Or if you did, the bag made you do it.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.000
This is my medicine.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.360
My family's.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.600
And this is mine.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.160
This is my son's.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.160
He is dead now.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.400
And up on Powder River,

42:26.320 --> 42:29.200
there is a man trying to forget
that he ever existed.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.160
So I'm gonna go up there, to remind him.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.680
And when I have,
it'll be the last thing he ever hears.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.640
I swear it!

42:40.680 --> 42:42.840
Lady, how long have you been
in this country?

42:42.920 --> 42:44.000
[Cornelia] Two weeks.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.040
And how many killings have you seen?

42:48.600 --> 42:49.640
Four.

42:50.760 --> 42:51.960
In two weeks?

42:53.760 --> 42:55.480
Well, I've lived here my whole life.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.200
I've lost father, mother, wife,

42:59.320 --> 43:01.040
sons, daughters, friends.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.160
Family.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.640
I've seen villages razed
and I've razed them myself:

43:06.320 --> 43:09.440
men, women and children,
shot, cut, stuck, hung.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.560
I've seen Hell and I've made Hell.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.840
And I'll carry it from here
to the sky beyond.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.320
But don't expect me to care for one boy.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.360
Please.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.160
Please.

43:59.760 --> 44:00.800
Can you shoot?

44:01.960 --> 44:03.000
If I have to.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.240
Oh, you'll have to.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.680
Them all been waiting for you.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.840
[gun cocks]

44:13.120 --> 44:14.800
Like they knew you was coming.

44:14.880 --> 44:15.840
Yes.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.320
-[Eli] You know how to dry it?
-[Cornelia] Hmm?

44:25.400 --> 44:26.680
You can't carry a wet pig.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.000
Not from here to Kearney.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.280
[Cornelia] Where's that?

44:29.360 --> 44:30.680
North aways.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.160
From there you're on your own.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.040
So not just killers and thieves then,

44:37.120 --> 44:38.680
has one such as you within it.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.400
Been both,

44:41.200 --> 44:42.560
likely both again.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.360
[Cornelia] How do you do?

44:44.840 --> 44:45.840
Better on my own.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.080
[laughs]

44:47.160 --> 44:48.800
No, what's your name?

44:50.200 --> 44:52.240
-I have many.
-[Cornelia] But which do you like?

44:53.560 --> 44:54.600
None.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.960
That's something else we share.

44:57.160 --> 45:00.080
Mine's Cornelia Locke,
Lady Cornelia Locke.

45:02.440 --> 45:03.760
That make you a wife of a chief?

45:03.840 --> 45:04.920
Daughter.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.040
I've never been married.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.160
Never will be.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.760
I'm also a Scorpio.
Do you know about that?

45:12.160 --> 45:13.840
-What?
-[Cornelia] Your star sign.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.520
Um, in London it's all the rage.
I'll tell you about it.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.480
Mine's about revenge.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.320
Can't help but think yours is too.

45:23.400 --> 45:26.160
