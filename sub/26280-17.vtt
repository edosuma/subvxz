WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:01.807
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:01.808 --> 00:02.974
The drug I've been working on

00:03.042 --> 00:05.699
for the past five years
just got approved by the FDA.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.246
- Wow. - Oh.
Congratulations.

00:07.247 --> 00:08.950
Was that the decongestant
you developed?

00:08.951 --> 00:12.772
No, we had to rebrand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.

00:14.075 --> 00:15.490
It's her
anti-inflammatory drug.

00:15.514 --> 00:16.677
Oh.

00:16.678 --> 00:18.890
Yep, three years of testing
and no reported side effects.

00:18.914 --> 00:21.080
- Hmm, so it works.
- Eh.

00:22.918 --> 00:25.452
Well, congratulations,
I'm so happy for you.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.786
Yeah, well,
I'm happy for you

00:26.855 --> 00:28.566
because I want you
to head up my sales team.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.758
Really? Me? Don't you want
someone with more experience?

00:31.827 --> 00:33.626
No, the job's all yours.

00:33.695 --> 00:35.573
All right, now I'm sure
some of you are wondering,

00:35.597 --> 00:36.996
"Who is this woman?

00:37.065 --> 00:39.332
"How did she get to be in charge
of the sales team?

00:39.401 --> 00:41.801
Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?"

00:42.704 --> 00:44.504
Because she is.

00:44.573 --> 00:47.507
"Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001

00:47.576 --> 00:49.476
and still fits
in those very same jeans?"

00:49.544 --> 00:51.644
Because she was, and she does

00:51.713 --> 00:53.113
and they're actually
a little baggy.

00:55.617 --> 00:58.351
"And the absence of side effects
means that Inflaminex

00:58.420 --> 01:00.687
"can be taken in conjunction
with other medications.

01:00.755 --> 01:02.989
It's a brand-new day."

01:03.058 --> 01:05.425
Such a good tagline, I forgot,
who came up with that?

01:05.494 --> 01:07.861
- You did.
- That's right, I did.

01:07.929 --> 01:10.363
Okay, I know it's late
and I've been

01:10.432 --> 01:11.592
working you guys really hard,

01:11.633 --> 01:12.913
so I have a little treat
for you.

01:12.968 --> 01:15.034
- We get to go home?
- No.

01:15.103 --> 01:18.171
You get to stay here
and get vitamin B12 shots.

01:19.407 --> 01:21.074
Oh, my God.
You guys are still here?

01:21.142 --> 01:24.444
We're happy to be here.
It's a brand-new day.

01:24.513 --> 01:28.414
It's 12:15, it's literally
a brand-new day.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.684
Everybody go home.

01:32.787 --> 01:34.227
All right, fine.
Go, get out of here.

01:34.289 --> 01:36.189
Go on.

01:36.258 --> 01:38.758
I think things
are going pretty good.

01:38.827 --> 01:41.194
Are you aware that Dave's
in the break room crying?

01:41.263 --> 01:42.996
Yeah, I told him
if he's gonna be a crybaby,

01:43.064 --> 01:44.597
go to the break room.

01:44.666 --> 01:45.999
I just really want
to be prepared

01:46.067 --> 01:48.001
for this conference.
- You're gonna do great.

01:48.069 --> 01:48.807
You really think so?

01:48.831 --> 01:50.070
Of course;
they're scared of you,

01:50.071 --> 01:51.552
you're scared of me--
The system works.

Okay, Howie,
I'm going.

02:22.109 --> 02:25.076
- Have a great conference.
- Thanks.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.945
Remember, I'm leaving
you with two babies.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.947
I expect to see two
babies when I get back,

02:29.016 --> 02:31.683
and they better be the same
two babies because I'll know.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.419
I think I'm capable
of babysitting.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.855
Don't call it babysitting;
they're your children.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.090
It's called parenting.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.258
What's the difference?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.394
You don't get paid.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.264
Now, the emergency
contacts are on the fridge

02:46.333 --> 02:47.777
and I left money for
food on the table.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.367
Oh, sounds like I do get paid.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.704
Don't worry.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.439
I got this covered.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.274
I know you do.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.543
Quick question,
where are the kids right now?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.278
They're upstairs.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.791
- They're at daycare.
- They're at daycare?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.815
- They're upstairs!
- Why are you messing with me?!

03:11.325 --> 03:13.658
Wow. That's a lot of
luggage for a weekend.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.993
I know.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.262
I didn't know what to wear,
so I brought a few options.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.198
Was one of the options the
option to never come back?

03:22.469 --> 03:24.669
I just really want
this weekend to go well.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.939
Doesn't answer my
question, but okay.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.107
I love you.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.108
I love you, too.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.409
And you're gonna do great.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.312
Just relax, stay out of your
head, and try to enjoy it.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.047
Aw. That reminds me
of what I said to you

03:36.116 --> 03:38.450
the first time
we slept together.

03:39.686 --> 03:40.886
I still use it.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.387
- It's a mantra.
-Yeah.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.689
Oh, thank goodness!

03:44.758 --> 03:45.835
I caught you before you left.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.791
I'm just going
for the weekend.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.792
Just the weekend.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.661
You all heard her say it.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.532
So, your convention
is in San Diego, right?

03:51.556 --> 03:52.431
Yes.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.533
Great. I need you to settle
a bet for Amy and me.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.868
I say,
when it's not Comic-Con,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.737
no one will be dressed
as superheroes.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.805
Mm-hmm.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.675
And I say fewer people will
be dressed as superheroes

04:03.744 --> 04:04.776
but still some.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.313
A crazy person in a cape
doesn't count.

04:08.382 --> 04:11.883
Mm, why not?
It counts at Comic-Con.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.252
Also, if you get a chance
to sneak into Hall H,

04:14.321 --> 04:17.555
last year, I left my neck
pillow under my seat.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.625
Uh, third row,
second from the aisle.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.892
I'll see what I can do.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.528
Thank you.
At least there will be

04:23.597 --> 04:25.564
one superhero in San Diego.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.013
So, Leonard, what are you
gonna do while Penny's away?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.169
I don't know.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.272
Maybe watch a movie
with subtitles.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.119
If you're looking for
something outside the norm,

04:36.143 --> 04:38.076
I have invented
a new chess variant

04:38.145 --> 04:41.379
where the bishops can
also move like knights.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.082
What do you call that,
Bishops Be Crazy?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.318
First of all,

04:46.386 --> 04:49.254
it would be
"Bishops <i>Are</i> Crazy."

04:49.323 --> 04:50.822
Not if you're being crazy.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.625
Checkmate.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.328
Hey, guys.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.396
- Hey.
- Hello.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.930
Where are the kids?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.932
I thought they were with you.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.078
- What? No! I...
- I'm kidding.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.002
They're at daycare.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.706
What about me makes you think
my heart can handle that joke?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.041
Hey.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.211
You guys want to come hang out
at my place this weekend?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.946
So we can help you babysit?

05:15.015 --> 05:16.615
Uh, it's not babysitting.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.416
They're my children.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.418
They're not our children.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.687
Oh. Well, for you guys,
then, it is babysitting.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.022
No offense,
Howard,

05:24.091 --> 05:25.401
but I don't want
to spend my weekend

05:25.425 --> 05:27.392
around your loud, sticky babies.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.228
You can't insult my
kids. I <i>am</i> offended.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.030
N-No, you can't be.
I said "no offense."

05:32.099 --> 05:34.866
That's like "no backsies"
but for offense.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.736
What do you say? We'll
play some board games.

05:37.804 --> 05:38.703
It'll be like a party.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.949
Three guys playing a board game

05:39.973 --> 05:41.906
doesn't sound
like much of a party.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.743
Someone doesn't
remember college very well.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.814
As opposed to the leading
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory,

05:49.883 --> 05:50.883
our product

05:50.951 --> 05:52.311
greatly reduces
the risk of ulcers.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.330
So it won't burn a hole
in your stomach.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.354
And it won't burn a hole
in your wallet, either!

05:56.423 --> 05:57.689
Okay.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.457
I got this.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.659
Thank you for stopping by.

06:00.727 --> 06:02.460
It's a brand-new day!

06:02.529 --> 06:05.096
- See? You're doing great.
- Yeah.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.965
Mediocre actress,
great drug pusher.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.700
Who knew?

06:09.636 --> 06:10.735
Inflaminex, huh?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.084
So what can you
tell me about it?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.905
- Well, we...
- Oh, don't waste your time.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.908
His name is Danny. He works for
one of the other drug companies.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.110
Hey, nothing wrong with
checking out the competition.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.813
Aw, we don't see you
as competition.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.348
You should.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.284
Our anti-inflammatory is hitting
the market this year, too.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.386
Well, ours has zero
drug interaction risk.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.355
Yeah. So does an Altoid.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.590
Speaking of Altoids,

06:32.659 --> 06:33.858
why don't you go get one?

06:33.927 --> 06:34.859
Okay.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.928
Let's everyone calm down.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.441
If you can't find
a pill for that here,

06:38.465 --> 06:40.298
then you're not trying
hard enough.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.100
It's all right.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.468
I'll go.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.970
I don't know what
it is about that guy,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.572
but he just gets
on my nerves.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.307
Well, you scared
the bad man away.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.376
Who's a good girl?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.281
They're still asleep.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.483
Apparently, when
I put someone down for a nap,

06:58.552 --> 07:01.319
they sleep hard.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.621
That's a weird brag, Howard.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.224
I'll get it.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.961
Bernadette thinks I have poor
parenting skills.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.965
Maybe she's basing that
on your poor husbanding skills.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.800
Who can say?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.203
I'm bad at a lot of things.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.706
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.775
Hey. I didn't think
you were coming.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.343
Um, I changed my mind.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.590
I thought it'd be fun to spend
some time with your children.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.880
Where are the
little scamps?

07:28.949 --> 07:29.881
- "Scamps"?
- I'm sorry.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.349
Tykes. Rug rats.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.218
What is the PC
term these days?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.553
What's going on?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.690
We were in the bookstore,
and I found this.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.025
<i>Experimenting</i>
<i>with Babies:</i>

07:41.094 --> 07:45.997
<i>50 Amazing Science Projects</i>
<i>You Can Perform on Your Kid.</i>

07:46.066 --> 07:47.465
You can't experiment
on his kids.

07:47.534 --> 07:48.800
Yeah, you're
not their father.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.435
You can't experiment on my kids.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.638
Fine. Can I at least
play a game with them?

07:53.707 --> 07:54.839
Perhaps...

07:54.908 --> 07:56.808
How Developed
is Your Peripheral Vision?

07:58.445 --> 08:00.912
Mine's great.
I saw that.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.521
You know, these experiments
are pretty harmless.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.258
There's one where you just put
the baby in front of a mirror

08:10.326 --> 08:12.360
and you watch them
watch themselves.

08:12.428 --> 08:14.328
That sounds adorable.
Let me see.

08:14.397 --> 08:16.408
How come when she talks
about experiments on babies,

08:16.432 --> 08:18.165
you think it's adorable,
but when I do it,

08:18.234 --> 08:19.800
everyone gets upset?

08:19.869 --> 08:22.203
I think I can speak
for all of us.

08:22.272 --> 08:24.138
You're just creepy.

08:26.009 --> 08:29.277
No offense.

08:29.345 --> 08:32.446
Hey, this one we can do
with both Michael and Halley.

08:32.515 --> 08:34.115
It's called Grabby Hands.

08:34.183 --> 08:37.485
Wasn't that your nickname
in high school?

08:37.553 --> 08:38.953
No, it was Mama's Boy.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.554
But the joke was on them,
because I love my mom.

08:41.624 --> 08:43.390
Guys, listen,

08:43.458 --> 08:45.226
you secure them both
in car seats

08:45.295 --> 08:46.961
and slowly spin a toy

08:47.030 --> 08:48.430
at the end of the
string above them.

08:48.498 --> 08:49.730
The younger baby
tends to reach

08:49.799 --> 08:50.932
with either hand,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.200
and the older baby prefers
the dominant hand.

08:53.269 --> 08:55.136
That is kind of interesting.

08:55.204 --> 08:57.338
And it's not really
experimenting <i>on</i> the kids.

08:57.407 --> 08:59.607
It's more like experimenting
with the kids.

08:59.676 --> 09:01.153
Well, I guess
if you think about it,

09:01.177 --> 09:02.655
it's kind of like
playing games with them.

09:02.679 --> 09:03.844
Okay, you know what,

09:03.913 --> 09:05.658
when they wake up,
we can try one or two of these.

09:05.682 --> 09:07.648
Yay!

09:09.185 --> 09:11.619
I said, "Yay!"

09:14.057 --> 09:16.657
Thank you.
It's a brand-new day.

09:16.726 --> 09:18.793
Wow, we got
a pretty good crowd here.

09:18.861 --> 09:20.861
I know. But not
as big as that booth.

09:20.930 --> 09:21.970
What's going on
over there?

09:21.998 --> 09:23.798
Yeah, that's Chantix.

09:23.866 --> 09:27.335
Ray Liotta's signing
autographs until 2:00.

09:29.405 --> 09:31.605
Hey, I thought we weren't
supposed to have our phones

09:31.674 --> 09:32.707
in the booth.

09:32.775 --> 09:35.576
That's a "you" rule,
not a "me" rule.

09:36.679 --> 09:38.279
Hey, can I help you?

09:38.348 --> 09:39.880
Actually, I'm looking
for the bathroom.

09:39.949 --> 09:41.849
Ah, yes. It's right next
to the laxative booth.

09:41.918 --> 09:43.851
Clever, right?

09:45.221 --> 09:48.022
So we meet again.

09:48.057 --> 09:50.624
Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right?
How's your launch going?

09:50.693 --> 09:51.892
Good.

09:51.961 --> 09:54.028
Is Dr. Rostenkowski around?

09:54.097 --> 09:56.275
No, she stepped out for a call,
although I wouldn't be surprised

09:56.299 --> 09:58.799
if she's in line
to meet Ray Liotta.

09:58.868 --> 10:01.102
Yeah. Something tells me
she's not crazy about me.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.904
Yeah. Something tells me that,
too, and it was her.

10:03.973 --> 10:07.208
Well, it doesn't matter, I was
actually hoping to talk to you.

10:07.276 --> 10:08.509
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:08.578 --> 10:10.811
You've done a terrific job
with Inflaminex.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.514
We're always on the lookout
for great salespeople.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.116
I think we could make you happy.

10:15.184 --> 10:16.584
Uh, thanks,
but I'm pretty happy.

10:16.652 --> 10:18.892
- I could be more happy.
- Tell it to your shrink, Karen.

10:21.557 --> 10:23.557
Hey, Howie, everything okay?

10:23.626 --> 10:24.959
Yeah, everything's great.

10:25.028 --> 10:29.230
I was just wondering if we had
any large barbecue tongs.

10:29.298 --> 10:31.766
Uh, bottom left drawer.
Are you guys grilling?

10:31.834 --> 10:34.335
Nope, just playing games
with the kids.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.003
Why do you need tongs?

10:36.072 --> 10:37.838
Love you, too, bye.

10:37.907 --> 10:39.874
I-I bet Michael grabs it
before Halley.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.509
Not a chance.

10:41.577 --> 10:44.078
Halley's a year older, you know
she's gonna get it first.

10:44.147 --> 10:46.714
I just think
he wants it more. Come on.

10:46.783 --> 10:48.327
Come on, you got this.
You got this, Michael

10:48.351 --> 10:50.818
Grab it. Grab it, Halley.
I believe in you.

10:50.887 --> 10:53.154
Oh! That was so close.
Just keep on trying.

10:53.222 --> 10:56.023
Hey. Hey, y-you guys want to
make this more interesting?

10:56.092 --> 10:58.059
By establishing
a double-blind protocol

10:58.127 --> 11:00.294
so we have a foundation
to publish? Yes.

11:03.332 --> 11:06.000
Look, here's my card. Maybe we
can get a drink this weekend.

11:06.069 --> 11:07.468
Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty busy.

11:07.537 --> 11:08.680
I have to inventory
all the giveaways.

11:08.704 --> 11:10.771
Hey, beat it. Shoo.

11:12.442 --> 11:13.741
So what did he want?

11:13.810 --> 11:15.509
- Nothing.
- He offered her a job.

11:15.578 --> 11:17.578
No one likes a tattletale,
Karen.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.347
So, what's up, traitor?

11:20.416 --> 11:22.650
Dammit, Karen.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.886
Okay, you want to engage
the babies.

11:25.955 --> 11:28.255
The subjects.

11:28.324 --> 11:31.025
- The babies.
- Fine. The babies.

11:31.094 --> 11:34.128
Baby-A and Baby-B.

11:34.197 --> 11:36.530
Engage them for a minute and
take note of their reactions.

11:36.599 --> 11:39.667
There's something familiar
about all this.

11:39.735 --> 11:40.768
Okay, go.

11:40.837 --> 11:41.902
Hello, baby.

11:41.971 --> 11:43.137
Are you having
a pleasant day?

11:43.206 --> 11:46.674
Oh, my G--
This is my entire childhood.

11:48.211 --> 11:50.544
Leonard, Leonard,
you're tainting my data.

11:50.613 --> 11:53.647
Uh, it's like word for word.

11:53.716 --> 11:55.850
How much time is left?
35 seconds.

11:55.918 --> 11:57.718
Oh really?
He's not reacting at all.

11:57.787 --> 11:59.353
Sheldon, he's a baby.

11:59.422 --> 12:01.422
That's not how you talk
to him, okay? J-Just watch.

12:01.491 --> 12:03.691
Hey.

12:03.759 --> 12:05.292
Halley.

12:05.361 --> 12:07.628
Who's your favorite uncle?

12:07.697 --> 12:10.197
Unka Koo.

12:11.234 --> 12:13.767
I got a dud,
let's switch.

12:15.238 --> 12:16.937
Keep trying. It's for science.

12:17.006 --> 12:18.083
Is that all
I was to her?

12:18.107 --> 12:21.075
Just an experiment?

12:21.144 --> 12:22.910
Michael. Michael,
you're making me look bad.

12:22.979 --> 12:24.512
I-Interact with me.

12:24.580 --> 12:25.946
He grabbed my finger.

12:26.015 --> 12:28.249
Oh, he's smiling.
I'm doing it.

12:29.719 --> 12:31.819
- That's time.
- Oh, really?

12:31.888 --> 12:33.287
Can we do one more?

12:33.356 --> 12:35.289
I think these guys need
to get some food.

12:35.358 --> 12:36.518
By pushing a lever at the end

12:36.592 --> 12:38.492
of an obstacle course
that we design?

12:39.996 --> 12:41.295
No, by opening the door

12:41.364 --> 12:43.364
to a hangar and letting
the airplane fly in.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.301
Although, Sheldon, maybe
it could be an experiment.

12:47.370 --> 12:49.703
Are you suggesting
we color-code their food

12:49.772 --> 12:51.505
so we can examine
their diapers later?

12:53.509 --> 12:54.708
Sure.

12:54.777 --> 12:58.179
These diapers
are gonna be full of data.

13:00.883 --> 13:02.983
I never thought I would see
Sheldon enjoying himself

13:03.052 --> 13:05.019
around babies so much.

13:05.087 --> 13:07.321
Yeah, how about that?

13:07.390 --> 13:10.024
So he just happened
to stumble upon a book

13:10.092 --> 13:12.526
about experimenting
with them the same day

13:12.595 --> 13:15.896
we were hanging out
with Howard's kids?

13:15.965 --> 13:18.832
Yep, don't overthink it.

13:20.102 --> 13:21.435
Oh, my God.

13:21.504 --> 13:26.106
At sleepaway camp my cabin
was called "Control Group."

13:31.747 --> 13:33.425
I can't believe you took
his business card.

13:33.449 --> 13:35.649
I can't believe we're still
talking about this.

13:35.718 --> 13:37.851
He handed it to me.
What was I supposed to do?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.160
Hand it back to him
and tell him

13:39.222 --> 13:41.155
to stick it
where the sun don't shine.

13:42.158 --> 13:43.490
You are not serious.

13:43.559 --> 13:45.092
Serious as the hepatitis

13:45.161 --> 13:48.195
their cholesterol medication
gave thousands of people.

13:48.264 --> 13:49.997
Did it?

13:50.066 --> 13:51.865
Maybe.

13:53.202 --> 13:55.035
You're not really
considering this, are you?

13:55.104 --> 13:57.204
I don't know.
It's kinda flattering.

13:57.273 --> 14:00.007
Please, he's just using you
to get to me.

14:00.076 --> 14:01.642
Or he's trying to get to me

14:01.711 --> 14:03.777
because I'm really good
at my job.

14:03.846 --> 14:05.012
Don't be so naive.

14:05.081 --> 14:06.091
They're our number one
competitor.

14:06.115 --> 14:07.815
They have a rival drug
coming out

14:07.883 --> 14:09.883
with a name I wish
we thought of-- Forsootha.

14:11.454 --> 14:12.920
It's got "soothe" right in it.

14:12.989 --> 14:14.221
How did we miss that?

14:14.290 --> 14:16.390
You know, our
brand recognition

14:16.459 --> 14:17.858
is three times
higher than theirs.

14:17.927 --> 14:20.794
And I did that with a stupid
product name and no assistant.

14:20.863 --> 14:23.330
You only have this job
because I gave it to you.

14:23.399 --> 14:24.509
You know who else
was begging you

14:24.533 --> 14:26.834
to head up their sales team?
Nobody.

14:26.902 --> 14:29.403
Well, you know who's
begging me now? Danny.

14:29.472 --> 14:31.572
I can't believe this is how
you thank me.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.574
I thanked you
by thanking you.

14:33.643 --> 14:36.043
And I sent you
that fancy box of pears.

14:36.112 --> 14:37.745
What am I supposed to do
with 20 pears?

14:37.813 --> 14:40.147
Have a pear party?

14:44.587 --> 14:46.820
Ooh, a juicy pear.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.824
Where are the kids?

14:50.893 --> 14:53.160
Oh, Sheldon's helping Howard
give them a bath.

14:53.229 --> 14:55.596
Hmm. So you really think

14:55.665 --> 14:57.698
you can trick Sheldon
into liking babies?

14:59.635 --> 15:01.535
I slept with him;
I married him.

15:01.604 --> 15:04.238
You want to be
against me?

15:06.642 --> 15:08.309
Oh, you were right, Amy.

15:08.377 --> 15:09.554
There were so many
valuable experiments

15:09.578 --> 15:12.046
to perform on them
during bath time.

15:12.114 --> 15:14.815
You don't say.

15:16.485 --> 15:19.520
I do. I tested their object
permanence with a rubber duck,

15:19.588 --> 15:22.656
and we took a run at Archimede''
water displacement,

15:22.725 --> 15:24.792
but that went
right over their heads.

15:24.860 --> 15:26.593
Well, I'm glad
you had a good day.

15:26.662 --> 15:28.362
I did.
It's so funny,

15:28.431 --> 15:30.331
we did all these experiments
on them

15:30.399 --> 15:32.800
and they didn't even notice.

15:32.868 --> 15:37.471
I know, I was worried it would
be obvious, but it wasn't.

15:39.608 --> 15:42.543
I guess we should go and let
Howard get them ready for bed.

15:42.611 --> 15:44.656
Yeah. Do you think he'd let us
come back and do some more?

15:44.680 --> 15:46.580
Maybe we could take them
to the park.

15:46.649 --> 15:48.649
Smart.
There'll be more babies.

15:48.718 --> 15:50.684
It's a bigger sample size.

15:56.359 --> 15:58.158
Where did Leonard go?

15:58.227 --> 16:00.561
Just tell me the truth, Mother.

16:01.997 --> 16:05.332
Was my whole childhood
just one big experiment?

16:05.401 --> 16:06.712
Of course not, dear.

16:06.736 --> 16:09.903
It was thousands
of small experiments.

16:11.507 --> 16:15.809
So that's all I was to you,
a-a test subject?

16:15.878 --> 16:19.012
No, you were my baby
and I found you fascinating.

16:19.081 --> 16:21.515
Really?

16:21.584 --> 16:25.018
Yes, watching you develop,
tracking your progress.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.654
I know I'm not
the warmest of parents,

16:27.723 --> 16:29.690
but it was time
we spent together,

16:29.759 --> 16:34.395
and, honestly, those are
some of my fondest memories.

16:36.165 --> 16:37.498
When did you stop?

16:37.566 --> 16:41.168
Oh, I can't tell you,
the experiment isn't over.

16:45.007 --> 16:46.907
Zangen's a fine company.

16:46.976 --> 16:48.475
They got a couple
of good drugs,

16:48.544 --> 16:50.511
but we control 60%
of the market.

16:50.579 --> 16:52.513
Hell, commissions on just
our fungal creams

16:52.581 --> 16:54.982
will put you
in a new Mercedes.

16:55.050 --> 16:56.350
Danny. Danny, look at me.

16:56.419 --> 16:58.018
Does this face
sell fungal creams?

16:59.155 --> 17:01.922
No. This face is cholesterol
drugs and above.

17:03.259 --> 17:04.558
Playing hard to get, huh?

17:04.627 --> 17:08.162
No one's ever
accused me of that before.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.498
Look, why don't I just give you
a number and see what you think?

17:11.567 --> 17:13.700
Ooh, are-are you gonna
write it on a napkin

17:13.769 --> 17:14.902
and slide it over to me?

17:14.970 --> 17:18.338
No, I was just gonna say it.

17:18.406 --> 17:20.240
- Aw.
- Do you want me

17:20.309 --> 17:21.887
to write it on a napkin
and slide it over to you?

17:21.911 --> 17:23.377
Yah.

17:23.445 --> 17:24.978
You got it.

17:27.450 --> 17:30.217
Danny, you rat bastard.

17:30.286 --> 17:31.897
What? I'm just making
your friend an offer.

17:31.921 --> 17:34.054
Yeah, he's writing it on
a napkin like in the movies.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.558
That's not an offer.

17:37.626 --> 17:39.193
Do you know how amazing
this girl is?

17:39.261 --> 17:41.495
- Aw. You think I'm amazing?
- Stay out of this.

17:42.565 --> 17:43.764
I'm serious..

17:43.833 --> 17:45.466
Not only is she
a helluva salesperson,

17:45.534 --> 17:47.401
she's the hardest worker
I've ever seen.

17:47.470 --> 17:49.247
I know, that's why I'm trying
to steal her from you.

17:49.271 --> 17:50.649
Well, then you're gonna have
to do a lot better than this,

17:50.673 --> 17:51.839
because I promise you,

17:51.907 --> 17:53.118
I'm not gonna let
her go without a fight.

17:53.142 --> 17:55.776
You do not want that,
she's a biter.

17:55.845 --> 17:57.377
Just think about it.

17:59.148 --> 18:00.514
You know, I don't have to.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.049
Thanks, but I'm
happy where I am.

18:02.117 --> 18:04.518
Let's go.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.222
Can I just see
what he wrote on the napkin?

18:08.290 --> 18:10.958
What napkin?

18:15.314 --> 18:19.016
You know, spending time
with Michael and Halley today

18:19.085 --> 18:22.153
really made me think
about our future children.

18:24.557 --> 18:26.323
Huh, what an interesting

18:26.392 --> 18:29.827
and completely
unforeseen development.

18:29.896 --> 18:31.695
What are you thinking?

18:31.764 --> 18:33.430
Well, I just can't decide.

18:33.499 --> 18:35.833
Either five sets of triplets

18:35.902 --> 18:38.469
or three sets of quintuplets.

18:38.571 --> 18:42.406
You know what? It doesn't matter
as long as they're healthy.

18:42.475 --> 18:44.909
And divisible by three.

18:44.977 --> 18:47.411
That's a lot
of babies, Sheldon.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.113
Oh, only for humans.

18:49.182 --> 18:52.216
For frogs, it's just
a drop in the bucket.

18:52.285 --> 18:55.119
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not a frog.

18:55.188 --> 18:57.188
Oh, don't feel bad, Amy.

18:57.256 --> 18:58.989
You're good enough for me.
