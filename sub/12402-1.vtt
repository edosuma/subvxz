00:11.846 --> 00:15.558

00:15.642 --> 00:16.809
<i>It's my life.</i>

00:16.893 --> 00:20.480
<i>And I'll do whatever it takes</i>

00:20.563 --> 00:21.648
Sassafras.

00:23.483 --> 00:24.525
[Maria] Thank you.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.862
I'm a silly goose-snake.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.907
Ooh! [laughing]

00:31.991 --> 00:33.409
<i>I feel French.</i>

00:47.382 --> 00:49.467
<i>Who knows what romance it will bring?</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:52.262
It's not what's in your head,
it's what's on it.

Can you blame them for looking?

01:02.313 --> 01:04.315
<i>No time to pay.</i> [giggling]

01:05.483 --> 01:07.860

01:24.127 --> 01:25.920
I just had my tubes tied.

At my age, it's not safe to have children.

[bell chiming]

01:37.515 --> 01:39.600
<i>Because when you feel this good...</i>

01:39.684 --> 01:42.437
Ain't no man gonna tell me
I ain't a woman.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.480
[woman] <i>Uh, Maria.</i>

01:44.564 --> 01:46.691
Hey, Maria. What are you doing?

01:48.276 --> 01:49.986
Uh, hair commercial?

01:50.069 --> 01:52.447
[woman] No. This is not a hair ad.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.448
It's the show.

01:53.531 --> 01:54.741
It's your show.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.994
-Let's get you to the van, okay?
-My show?

01:58.828 --> 01:59.912
I have a show?

02:01.122 --> 02:05.126
I'm a 45-year-old woman,
who's clearly sun-damaged.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.170
My skin's getting softer,
yet my bones are jutting out,

02:08.253 --> 02:10.840
so I'm half soft, half sharp.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.550
And I have a show!

02:12.634 --> 02:15.637
What a great late-in-life opportunity!
[chuckling]

02:15.720 --> 02:16.846

Oh.

02:47.752 --> 02:48.669
-How are you?
-Good!

02:48.753 --> 02:51.214
I'm thrilled to see you.
You look lovely.

02:51.297 --> 02:52.965
Please come into my office.

-Hey!
-The prodigal son returns.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.762
Six long months and now you're back.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.598
How do you feel?
Refreshed? Revitalized? Renewed?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.975
Yes, I do... I feel...

03:03.059 --> 03:07.146
I feel very good, a little tired
because of the heavy meds.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.857
But, I'm also back on carbs.

03:09.941 --> 03:13.236
I'm eating pancakes almost all day.

03:13.319 --> 03:16.948
The entire entertainment industry
has been eagerly awaiting

03:17.031 --> 03:18.658
-your glorious return.
-[sighs]

03:18.741 --> 03:20.701
I've made some big changes, too.

Big Hollywood power desk.

03:23.663 --> 03:25.373
-Solid glass. That's not all.
-Oh.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.749
Kerplunk.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.502
Sexy Hollywood power boots.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.296
Move over, Carrie Bradshaw.
From <i>Sex and the City</i>.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.090
I'd like to get you booked on that.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.466
-Is it still on?
-[clunking]

03:35.550 --> 03:37.760
[Bruce] God damn it.
Sexy power boots!

03:38.094 --> 03:41.806
Now that you're back,
tell me exactly what you want to do.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.309
-Right.
-TV show, movie, world comedy tour...

03:45.393 --> 03:47.186
I'm gonna take a real shot at it.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.105
-Yeah.
-Chantrelle!

03:49.188 --> 03:52.150
Get me the hidden big opportunities list,
would you?

03:52.233 --> 03:55.778
Okay, I would like to do less, not more.

03:55.862 --> 03:59.115
That's the thing.
Could it be less ambitious?

03:59.198 --> 04:01.909
Or maybe not ambitious anymore.

04:01.993 --> 04:03.286
Less ambitious?

04:03.870 --> 04:05.288
No work for Maria.

04:05.371 --> 04:08.916
I mean, I want to work a little,
but just smaller things.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.460
Less pressure. I mean...

04:10.543 --> 04:12.044
Stand-up at a book store,

04:12.128 --> 04:16.841
alone in my living room
or in a vintage eyeglass shop, or--

04:16.923 --> 04:19.677
Sweetheart, are you pulling back
because of me?

04:19.761 --> 04:23.598
I can reel in that big fish.
I can land the monster shark.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.516
Believe me, you've seen the desk.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.685
No. This is not about you at all.

04:27.769 --> 04:30.021
I'm trying to get some balance in my life.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.065
I know I've done some things I regret

04:33.149 --> 04:35.234
and I made some enemies, I'm sure,

04:35.318 --> 04:39.405
-from some of my behavior and I'd--
-[Chantrelle] Mark "Sugar Ray" McGrath?

04:39.489 --> 04:40.531
[Maria] Okay. What?

04:40.615 --> 04:42.658
-The singer?
-Don't listen to her.

04:46.496 --> 04:48.790
[glass crackling]

04:50.166 --> 04:52.668
-I bet they can buff that out.
-I'm sure.

04:52.752 --> 04:53.920
You know what it is?

04:54.003 --> 04:56.881
I just really wanna reconnect
with my community.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.634
I don't even know who my neighbors are.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.387
Forgive my distraction. This is
a $37,000 handblown Murano glass desk.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.305
Oh, my God.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.390
So understandably I'm irked with myself.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.977
Yes, neighbors.
A serendipitous meeting on a park bench.

05:10.061 --> 05:11.103
"How do you do, sir?"

05:11.187 --> 05:13.523
"I'm fine, thank you."
"Is that your dog, sir?"

05:13.606 --> 05:14.857
That's it.

05:14.941 --> 05:17.944
Human interaction. Indeed.
I'm gonna make some calls.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.529
I love it. I love it.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.572
A neighborhood park bench.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.783
That's exactly
what was on my vision board.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.785
<i>When I was in the psych ward,</i>

05:25.868 --> 05:28.287
<i>I kept cutting out benches </i>
<i>for my vision board.</i>

05:28.371 --> 05:30.790
<i>-I didn't know why. And now I know:</i>
-[inaudible]

05:30.873 --> 05:32.583
<i>It was to manifest community!</i>

05:32.667 --> 05:34.293
Bruce, you did it!

05:34.377 --> 05:36.587
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

05:36.671 --> 05:39.048
but you're happy with me.
That's what matters.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.591
-Yes.
-Solutions everywhere.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.927
By the way,
I'm gonna call these people.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.596
I'm gonna say they delivered
the desk that way

05:45.680 --> 05:47.223
and how dare you, sir!

05:47.306 --> 05:50.017
Really, why should I pay
for the buffing? [chuckling]

05:50.101 --> 05:52.353
[glass shattering]

05:53.020 --> 05:55.856
Well... That's it.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.775
I put my foot through my nest egg.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.151
[Maria] Oh!
[dial tone]

06:00.278 --> 06:01.320
[Maria] <i>The bench arrived.</i>

06:01.404 --> 06:04.699

06:04.782 --> 06:06.701
<i>Larissa, also my best friend.</i>

06:06.784 --> 06:08.744
-Hey, dipshit.
-Hey!

06:08.828 --> 06:12.623
-What's with the bench?
-Hey. Well, it is to connect

06:12.707 --> 06:13.916
and create community.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.960
How fun.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.255
Isn't this great?
It's all coming together.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.048
Why? Because you have a bench?

06:21.132 --> 06:23.551
It's not just my bench,
it's your bench, Dagmar.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.760
It's your bench, Larissa.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.930
-Thank you.
-It's your bench, sir!

06:28.014 --> 06:29.515
Come have a seat.

06:29.599 --> 06:30.850
[grunts]

06:30.933 --> 06:32.810
That's it.
I'm gonna rip you in half.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.687
That guy needs a bench for sure.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.315
[Dagmar] Why don't you come back?
You kidding me?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.525
Know what?
I'm gonna make a note of this guy

06:39.609 --> 06:40.985
in my notebook.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.323
Oh, I get it. This bench is a way
for you to access romance.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.657
-No.
-[Larissa] Yes.

06:46.741 --> 06:49.744
-It's like a fuck bench? I love that.
-No, no!

06:49.827 --> 06:53.497
That's the way to build community.
Sit here all night, suck Ds,

06:53.581 --> 06:55.374
knock out your teeth,
have a good time.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.794
[Larissa] Maybe it's time
to get back out there? S some Ds.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.880
It's about learning people's names.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.299
The more names you learn,
the happier you are.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.092
-[Larissa] I didn't know that.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.469
You're a bad friend.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.512
I am a wonderful friend.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.972
-Oh, really?
-Mhmm.

07:10.056 --> 07:12.391
You didn't visit Maria
in her time of need.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.393
We've already talked about this.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.312
I didn't need to be visited. Besides,

07:16.395 --> 07:18.648
-I'm sure you were busy, Larissa.
-I wasn't.

07:18.731 --> 07:20.858
-Okay.
-I wasn't busy at all.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.902
I didn't come because I'm an empath.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.947
When people are experiencing
negative emotion,

07:26.030 --> 07:28.074
it sticks to me hardcore.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.076
-Yeah.
-[Larissa] So, I guess...

07:30.159 --> 07:33.120
It's like I cared too much to show up.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.914
[Dagmar] You're a bad friend.

07:34.997 --> 07:39.126
Look at this! The bench has got us
communicating as a group.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.920
Let's go meet the neighbors!

07:41.003 --> 07:42.505
Okay.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.256
Oh, God. I'm terrified.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.468
[knocking]

07:49.261 --> 07:50.262
Hi.

07:50.346 --> 07:54.183
I'm Maria...
and your name is, please, sir?

07:55.393 --> 07:57.770
-Oscar.
-Hi, Oscar.

07:57.853 --> 08:01.273
I am your neighbor
and these are my friends...

08:02.024 --> 08:04.402
I wanted to let you know
I put in a bench

08:04.485 --> 08:06.529
that I wanted you to come over and enjoy.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.655
Go fuck yourself.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.948
Okay--

08:12.868 --> 08:14.328
Hi! I'm Maria. I'm from...

08:14.412 --> 08:16.497
I live across the street and...

08:16.580 --> 08:18.249
Just... gonna put in a bench.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.834
I think it's helpful for--

08:19.917 --> 08:21.669
Okay, all right. That's good.

08:21.752 --> 08:25.006
And I just wanna invite you
and your family or-- Okay.

08:25.089 --> 08:29.385
[Dagmar] We are loving, open people!
Don't shut the fucking door in my face!

08:29.468 --> 08:31.262
[Maria] No? Okay.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.388
She hates you.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.306
[Dagmar] I'll kick her ass!

08:36.392 --> 08:38.309
Why don't you put that in a fun binder?

08:38.394 --> 08:41.480
I'm not very organized
and don't have the resources--

08:41.563 --> 08:43.607
Maria, I just had a Larissa thought.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.734
-Okay.
-Okay?

08:44.817 --> 08:46.736
Let me be your assistant.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.072
That would make me feel really useful.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.449
The only way to be sure

08:51.532 --> 08:53.993
that I'll be there for you
is if you pay me.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.162
-Okay.
-I'm gonna need $35 an hour.

08:56.245 --> 08:58.414
The music in the house
has to be my choice.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.832
I need Wednesdays off.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.792
It's religious.
You're not allowed to ask.

09:01.876 --> 09:04.211
Six weeks off in summer,
like the Italians.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.671
You know what?

09:06.714 --> 09:09.592
I do need help.
And it's okay to admit that.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.137
I accept with love and gratitude.
You're hired.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.096
Great!

09:14.180 --> 09:16.599
I have an appointment.
I'll be 4 hours late.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.726
Okay, it's all coming together.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.063
Yeah, even my... bench
which is now covered in garbage.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.689
-Okay. All right.
-Oh, no.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.859
It's become a bit of a wildlife preserve.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.903
-[siren wails]
-Evening, ladies.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.030
-Hi, Officer.
-You can't just...

09:31.113 --> 09:33.657
dump your furniture and garbage out here.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.159
Oh, no, it's not garbage.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.746
It's a neighborhood bench.
It's for the community.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.957
Do you have a permit
for the community bench?

09:42.041 --> 09:45.544
-Oh, no. Is that required?
-It is.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.631
If you don't have one,
you're gonna have to go down

09:48.714 --> 09:50.549
to City Hall and get one.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.760
-Or I can write you a 4950.
-[Maria groans]

09:52.843 --> 09:54.678
I don't wanna write you a 4950.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.224
I can't do it right now.
I have to get ready for a stand-up gig.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.768
-Oh, invite him.
-[Maria] Maybe...

10:00.851 --> 10:02.853
What a helmet.
That's a good shaped head,

10:02.937 --> 10:04.688
if you know what I mean.

10:04.772 --> 10:08.484
Would you wanna come to a comedy show?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.194
They're so wonderful.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.156
[stammering] Oh, God.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.991
Maria, I'm sorry. Come here.

10:16.075 --> 10:18.536
You're gonna put stand-up in your show?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.788
-[man] Cut!
-Yeah. Is that bad?

10:20.871 --> 10:22.498
It's... Yeah, it's bad.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.834
It's just been done so many times.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.837
You know, you got Louie,
Seinfeld, Chappelle,

10:27.920 --> 10:29.296
Amy Schumer, my two pilots...

10:30.131 --> 10:31.841
-They didn't go.
-I'm so sorry.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.885
We haven't officially met.
Are you the comedy police?

10:34.969 --> 10:37.930
I'm a friend giving friendly advice.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.391
You're an actor.
Just say your lines, monkey.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.768
Give your audience some credit.

10:42.852 --> 10:46.355
They can deal with
form-busting narrative innovations.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.065
-We've all seen <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

10:48.149 --> 10:50.442
All right, well, I haven't.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.862
You gotta see it.
Anna Gunn is amazing in it.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.781
But look, people can deal
with the time jump.

10:55.865 --> 10:59.368
All right? Just don't make it jarring.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.370
If we do, we definitely wouldn't do it

11:01.453 --> 11:03.038
in a way that was jarring.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.169
Here you go.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.796
And don't thank me.
I'm a stranger.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.258
[upbeat music]

11:14.341 --> 11:16.218
-[Maria] Hi.
-Karen Grisham.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.971
-Come here, I'm a hugger.
-Oh, thank you.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.556
Wow.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.558
Congrats, Maria.

11:22.641 --> 11:23.934
-You made the Grish-list.

11:25.102 --> 11:30.566
Maria, I am the most powerful
talent agent in this city or galaxy.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.110
You know why?
Every time I walk into a room,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.487
I know exactly how
I would kill each person.

11:35.571 --> 11:36.780
[waiter] Arnold Palmer?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.866
Elbow to forehead,
golf pencil through heart.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.119
-He meant the drink.
-Oh.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.622
A fucking beverage.
Fuck off, I'm in a meeting.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.124
Look, open-kimono time.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.959
I asked you here 'cause I'm a fan.

11:49.043 --> 11:51.086
-This is a fan lunch, okay?
-Wow.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.130
The world loves you.
I love you.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.675
You are a hilarious...

11:58.010 --> 12:00.596
-Comedian.
-[both laughing]

12:00.679 --> 12:03.057
So, you wanna represent me or...

12:03.140 --> 12:06.477
Are you kidding me?
I would murder that waiter,

12:06.560 --> 12:09.063
snapping his gay neck,
jamming that oyster fork

12:09.146 --> 12:10.940
in both eyes to represent you.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.609
But Karen Grisham's booked.
Sorry. Got a full boat.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.278
-Ah.
-I got so many goddamn clients.

12:16.362 --> 12:17.488
-Yeah.
-And honestly,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.406
I just wanna be your friend, okay?

12:19.490 --> 12:21.825
When paparazzi chase you at
the Trevi Fountain

12:21.909 --> 12:24.536
to get a shot of your rancid snapper,
I got your back.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.622
-That's so nice.
-I swear to God,

12:26.705 --> 12:30.417
I will airlift in one of those
Italian fucking scooter things.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.128
What are they fucking called?
Ves... Uh...

12:33.212 --> 12:34.505
-Ves... uh...
-Vespa.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.632
[both laughing]

12:36.715 --> 12:38.008
Okay, that's good.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.843
-[laughing]
-Oh, come on.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.428
You on a Vespa?

12:41.512 --> 12:43.472
That is my new favorite image.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.807
I swear, that is good.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.100
[both laughing]

12:46.183 --> 12:48.268
-See? We're friends, right?
-Yeah, I know.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.437
You're riding tall on the Vespa.
I'm in...

12:50.521 --> 12:52.147
What the fuck's cunt is it called?

12:52.231 --> 12:53.941
The side thing, the, um...

12:54.024 --> 12:57.236
Attached to the motorcycle.
What the fuck! Oh, God.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.947
-Sidecar.
-[screaming and laughing]

13:00.030 --> 13:02.783
-Sidecar. You are a riot.
-Yeah.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.827
That's our inside joke.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.078
-It's ours. Okay?
-Okay.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.414
-Vespa sidecar's you and me.
-[laughing] Okay.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.748
I adore you.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.292
God, I wish I could rep you.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.753
I... [laughing]
Okay, wait. Now, stop.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.131
We're getting carried away.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.258
I just wanna be your best friend. I do.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.761
Let me be your spirit guide
to the showbiz community.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.638
-I can do that for you.
-[bleating]

13:24.722 --> 13:25.973
Exactly, you have a manager.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.975
I would never wanna
poach you from...

13:28.058 --> 13:29.268
Who are you with?

13:29.351 --> 13:31.103
Bruce Ben-Bacharach. My manager.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.897
Do me a favor.
Don't tell Bruce about this meeting.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.649
-Oh, my gosh.
-He'll get threatened.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.943
I don't have time to walk him
off the ledge.

13:38.027 --> 13:40.362
I adore you. This has been a joy.

13:40.446 --> 13:43.157
-[laughing]
-This is unbelievable. I swear to God...

13:43.240 --> 13:46.160
-I haven't even had coffee.
-Want anything to order?

13:46.243 --> 13:47.161
I have another lunch.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.163
-[snapping fingers] John Cryer.
-Hi.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.664
-Karen Grisham.
-Okay.

13:50.748 --> 13:52.166
-Come here.
-[Maria] So great.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.877
-[Karen] Give me some sugar.
-Okay. Oh, sorry.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.670
-Okay.
-[John] Thank you.

13:56.754 --> 13:58.255
It'll be a private lunch.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.049
-Okay, sorry.
-Wanna take the chair?

14:00.132 --> 14:02.217
It'll be private.
No one else will barge in.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.219
-Okay.
-All right, you be well.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.847
[Karen] Comedian. Very funny.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.307
I think. Never seen her work.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.018
-Congrats. You made the Grish-list.
-Oh.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.483
[engine revving]

14:19.610 --> 14:21.653
I'm happy with my representation.

14:21.737 --> 14:22.654
I'm sorry.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.032
Read the note!

14:25.449 --> 14:26.450
Right.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.746
What--

14:30.829 --> 14:32.373
It's our joke!

14:32.456 --> 14:33.999
It's our private joke.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.251
[both laughing]

14:36.335 --> 14:38.253
-It's a Vespa.
-Right.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.506
-It's for you.
-[both laughing]

14:40.589 --> 14:42.966
-Okay, bye.
-Get on the fucking bike!

14:44.218 --> 14:46.220
-You're gonna ride it!
-[Maria] Okay.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.305
I have a car!

14:48.389 --> 14:49.848
I'll just leave it here.

14:49.932 --> 14:50.974
[door bell ringing]

14:51.767 --> 14:52.851
Bruce. Hi.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.520
Karen Grisham had lunch with you

14:54.603 --> 14:56.188
You're friends with an inside joke.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.191
Could we have a discussion about that?

14:59.274 --> 15:00.734
Yeah. Of course.

15:00.818 --> 15:04.905
So, what else did she say?
And don't leave out a single thing, okay?

15:04.988 --> 15:07.658
Well, uh, she says we're BFFs.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.284
[Bruce squealing]

15:09.368 --> 15:10.577
[both chuckling]

15:10.661 --> 15:12.621
[continues squealing]

15:13.789 --> 15:15.833
I think she wants to represent you.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.127
Oh, no, she doesn't.

15:18.210 --> 15:23.090
She's very clear on that.
She just wants to be best friends.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.967
That sounds pretty good to me,

15:25.050 --> 15:26.802
You're my manager. That's all I need.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.470
Are you crazy?

15:28.554 --> 15:30.931
She's our only chance
at making real money.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.434
She doesn't wanna sign me.
I can't make her.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.437
That's right. You can't.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.938
That's why I'm on the team.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.358
To beg somebody else to be on the team.

15:41.442 --> 15:44.445
Listen, you're a 36-year-old
sun-damaged actress

15:44.528 --> 15:45.737
with 8 cartoons on your resumé.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.156
That's a good point.

15:47.239 --> 15:48.490
Karen Grisham is a shark.

15:48.574 --> 15:52.077
Let me be the chum to drive her
to a frenzy of interest.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.746
Bruce, doesn't chum get devoured?

15:54.830 --> 15:57.666
[chuckling] Not smart chum.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.169
Speaking of which, come this way.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.214
I had a self-touching problem as a kid.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.551
My father insisted I have hobbies
where I work with my hands.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.179
-[Maria] Oh.
-Ta-da!

16:10.262 --> 16:13.056
Oh, Bruce, what did you do?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.392
I chummed it up!
So, what do you think?

16:15.476 --> 16:19.188
[stutters] I was gonna return it.
Now it's all messed up.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.398
You've got solder all over it.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.566
That's not solder,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.359
those are bits of flesh
from my hand.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.111
-[sighing]
-Look...

16:26.195 --> 16:27.779
I did this to say,

16:27.863 --> 16:29.948
"This can work."
"This is harmony."

16:30.032 --> 16:32.951
Karen sits here, that's great.
That's Karen.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.369
Maximum respect.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.371
I am over here, at the end.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.624
Like Pluto, the most important planet.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.836
Not because it's in the center,
because it contains from the perimeter.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.380
I don't think that's how Karen saw it.

16:45.464 --> 16:48.509
Why don't we motor on over there
and we can show her?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.427
-She can see.
-[whispering] Okay.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.055
-Adopt the seat of command.
-Okay.

16:53.138 --> 16:57.059
You're the client, Karen's the agent,
I'm the manager. No one's left out!

17:05.358 --> 17:06.859
-[man] Hey!
-Hi!

17:08.153 --> 17:09.613
[man] Fucking idiots.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.659
Gotta admit it, you got me
kind of excited to join Karen's flock.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.368
You and me, both.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.289
Take a hard left before
Beverly Hills Whale Oil!

17:23.417 --> 17:25.378
-Are you okay? Okay.
-Great!

17:25.462 --> 17:27.297
[screeching]

17:27.381 --> 17:29.424
[Maria] Great deal on whale oil!

17:29.550 --> 17:31.802

[blows whistle] Hey!

17:46.525 --> 17:48.277
You're in the middle of our game!

17:48.360 --> 17:50.237
[Maria] I should respect that. Sorry.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.031
Hey! Oh, my God!

17:53.115 --> 17:54.908
Mark!

17:54.992 --> 17:56.618
Mark McGrath!

17:56.702 --> 17:57.786
It's me, Maria!

17:57.869 --> 17:59.413
Oh, my God! Maria Bamford!

17:59.496 --> 18:00.622
So great to see you again.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.207
Parentheses, sarcasm.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.294
Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath,
Sorry about what I did to you.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.795
What did I do to you?

18:07.629 --> 18:09.047
Did we, you know...

18:09.131 --> 18:11.133
Did I disappoint you sexually?

18:11.216 --> 18:12.384
You, me?

18:12.467 --> 18:14.469
-Yeah. [chuckling]
-You kidding me?

18:14.553 --> 18:16.263
I'm Mark McGrath!

18:16.346 --> 18:19.725
I can bone this entire team
with my hands tied behind my back!

18:19.808 --> 18:20.767
Oh.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.604
That's how it would have to happen.
I'm straight.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.564
-Super straight!
-Okay.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.733
But your hair isn't that disgusting.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.109
-I guess.
-Aw.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.528
Thanks, Latrisse DuVois by Gary.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.821

It doesn't matter what I did.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.201
Well, I'm not saying that.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.705
What matters is I hurt you
and I'm gonna make it up to you.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.915
I'm gonna make things right.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.462
Come on, that's not even the right melody.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.923
We couldn't afford the melody, Mark,
and you know it.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.800
I'm gonna make things right.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.135
Please, don't.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.470
I heard "please."

18:57.137 --> 18:59.306
And I know just the person to do it.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.224
[Bruce] Mark, you old such and such.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.310
[Mark over phone] <i>Suck my dick, Bruce.</i>

19:03.393 --> 19:06.188
For a man widely known as Sugar Ray,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.857
you are somewhat
under-endowed in sweetness.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.069
I have here with me
the one and only Maria Bamford.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.779
Hey, Mark.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.656
<i>-Oh, God.</i>
-Great news, Mark.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.158
Maria has agreed
to perform a stand-up benefit

19:18.241 --> 19:20.577
for your Open Arms charity.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.537
<i>-Really?</i>
-Yes, super really!

19:22.621 --> 19:24.790
I didn't even know you had a charity,

19:24.873 --> 19:27.668
-but Bruce told me about it.
-Oh, big fan.

19:27.751 --> 19:31.129
Yeah, so Open Arms. Wow!
I'm all about that.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.716
Openness and engagement
and sometimes partying.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.302
And I thought we could
combine your charity

19:37.386 --> 19:39.805
with a block party to unveil my bench.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.932
Yes, two pelicans with one Miata!

19:42.015 --> 19:45.811
<i>That sounds good.</i>
<i>A block party could be very cool.</i>

Make sure that Mark McGrath's
Open Arms charity logo is on it.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.626
I don't have a car.
Maybe Dagmar can do it.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.877

20:10.961 --> 20:14.005
Can you make copies of this

No. Excuse me.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.393
They're lobbying to change
open carry laws,

20:31.189 --> 20:32.482

Okay, I'm not carrying
a gun for you, okay?

20:35.193 --> 20:37.362
That's where I draw the line.

20:37.446 --> 20:41.032
-About Starbucks, I'd love a frappe.
-[Maria] Bruce didn't say...

20:41.116 --> 20:42.117
anything about guns.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.995
-[sighing] Bruce.
-Maybe I can make this work.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.539
This event is for
people speaking their minds,

20:47.622 --> 20:49.458
which I support,
even if I hate what they say.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.252
-And being open is good, right?
-[Larissa] Mmm.

-Terrible.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.559
Okay.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.102
-Good evening.
-Hello, Officer.

21:09.186 --> 21:13.398
Okay, if you don't have
a permit for the bench...

21:13.482 --> 21:15.650
I'm gonna issue a bench warrant.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.486
Are you kidding me?

21:17.569 --> 21:19.404
You'll have a red brick wall on stage.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.325
This is what I was telling you.
She's doing stand-up.

21:23.408 --> 21:27.162
Maria, you can't do stand-up.
We're really bummed out about it.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.371
Are you a cop?

21:28.455 --> 21:31.625
He's supposed to be...
This is the costume he puts together.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.710
You gave me two hours' notice.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.796
I auditioned to be the love interest.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.506
I'm not gonna make out with anyone?

21:37.589 --> 21:39.090
Just don't do stand-up.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.467
I hear what you're saying.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.220
I was gonna use it
to explain why I went to Duluth.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.388
We show three different time periods.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.224
Not just when my career blew up,

21:47.307 --> 21:49.226
but also when I did.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.852
I don't wanna lose the audience.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.938
Make it look different.

21:53.021 --> 21:57.442
Use color as a time signifier.
Mess with the saturation.

-Okay. Oh, get...

21:59.820 --> 22:03.073

22:03.156 --> 22:04.699
-Yes.
-Is any of this usable?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.744
Too gray.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.413
Ew, too yellow.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.583
[gasping] More blue?

22:14.543 --> 22:17.671
[stammers] Less blue.
Split the difference.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.382
That's perfect.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.134
-You want blue? Here's a blue.
-Okay.

22:23.218 --> 22:27.305
Let's hear it for Maria,
who is lapping everyone

22:27.389 --> 22:29.057

22:29.140 --> 22:32.727
Although, she does have
an advantage with her hypomania.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.397
Excuse me, Janice.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.857
I brought in the <i>People</i> mag, Oscar issue,

22:37.941 --> 22:40.735
and someone cut out all the Oscars.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.071
And now, I have no Oscars
for my vision board.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.825
We should all not hog the Oscars, Dan.

22:46.908 --> 22:50.078

are inconvenient for you, Donna!

22:50.161 --> 22:53.623
Hey, whoa, Dan, Donna,
there's enough Oscars for everyone.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.418
There are not enough Oscars for everyone,

22:56.501 --> 22:58.086

23:06.469 --> 23:08.096
No, Maria, we are not.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.473
We are all here to better ourselves,

23:10.557 --> 23:14.352
and sometimes that means
expressing your negative emotions.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.313
In a constructive way.

23:16.438 --> 23:21.610
Is there anyone in group who just...
who really chaps your crapper?

23:21.693 --> 23:25.530
-Anything.
-No! Everyone here is super nice.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.034
Well, that's something
that we need to work on.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.746
Because Donna is a straight-up "B."

28:20.742 --> 28:22.201
Did you know?

28:22.285 --> 28:25.580
I did not read the fine print
until yesterday afternoon.

28:25.663 --> 28:28.708
At that point, I was beyond chagrin,
so I hid from you.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.419
-Mostly in here.
-I don't know what to do.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.922
If I do do stand-up,
Patton will banish me

28:34.005 --> 28:35.673
from alternative comedy.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.383
But if don't do stand-up,

28:37.467 --> 28:40.428
I let down my community and...

28:41.721 --> 28:43.598
Especially since we sold tickets.

-No, Bruce...

29:00.281 --> 29:03.201
I sunk a tremendous amount
of my own money into this.

29:03.284 --> 29:04.410
-That's all.
-Oh, God.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.037
I'm with you, no matter what.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.247
-Okay.
-Totally!

29:07.330 --> 29:10.583
Because I am now,
and shall ever remain, your chum.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.126
[camera shutter clicking]

29:12.210 --> 29:13.503
[police radio chatter]

29:13.586 --> 29:15.088
I'll give it more thought.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.382
-That's all I'm asking.
-Okay.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.092
[Maria] <i>I felt I owed it to Mark</i>

29:19.175 --> 29:20.385
<i>to go ahead with the party.</i>

29:20.468 --> 29:23.721
<i>I didn't have to do stand-up,</i>
<i>I could tell stories from the heart.</i>

29:23.805 --> 29:25.390
<i>As long as I pulled</i>
<i>the neighborhood together,</i>

29:25.473 --> 29:27.267
<i>it would be a success.</i>

29:27.350 --> 29:29.686
I'd like to introduce you
to a friend of mine,

29:29.811 --> 29:32.313
but instead here's Bruce Ben-Bacharach.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.983
-[scattered applause]
-[man] Orange drink sucks!

29:35.066 --> 29:36.859
[Bruce clearing throat]

29:36.943 --> 29:39.279
What Mark failed to mention is that

29:39.362 --> 29:42.532
VIP wrist bands are good
for only one orange drink.

29:42.615 --> 29:46.369
Please make sure to put all
your business cards into the fish bowl

29:46.452 --> 29:48.663
for the drawing of the dual-action shotgun

29:48.746 --> 29:49.872
from Lil Slaughters.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.542
Lil Slaughters, let's do something
about mental illness.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.252
-Yeah!
-[gunshot]

29:54.335 --> 29:57.505
Now everybody,
please enjoy the hilarious comedy

29:57.588 --> 29:59.841
of the great Maria Bamford!

30:00.717 --> 30:01.801
[all cheering]

30:01.884 --> 30:03.636
Okay, um...

30:04.637 --> 30:08.141
Thank you so much.
Let's not call it comedy,

30:08.224 --> 30:10.351
let's call it neighbor talk.

30:10.435 --> 30:13.438
Oh, Christ. You weren't kidding.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.523
-She's gonna do stand-up.
-[Patton sighs]

30:15.606 --> 30:18.359
[Patton] Look at that brick wall.
Louis is gonna shit.

30:18.443 --> 30:21.154
Welcome to our first annual
neighborhood block party

30:21.237 --> 30:25.074
and Open Arms, open carry,
guns-for-everyone benefit.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.327
-[gunshot]
-Oh, God! Okay.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.620
I just think we could clap instead--

30:29.704 --> 30:30.913
-[gunshots]
-Oh, God! Okay.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.040
-[cheering]
-There's no need--

30:32.123 --> 30:33.124
-[gunshot]
-[Maria] Oh!

30:33.207 --> 30:35.251
The point is, I am not doing comedy.

30:35.335 --> 30:39.297
I am trying to bring people together
because you mean so much to me.

30:39.380 --> 30:42.383
And, I really want to be a part
of this community,

30:42.467 --> 30:44.844
-I love... I love you.
-[guns cocking]

30:46.137 --> 30:47.263
Be funnier!

30:47.347 --> 30:50.266
-You should try to be funnier.
-[whispering] Okay.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.226
Okay. Uh...

30:52.310 --> 30:54.979
-You guys thinking of shooting her?
-It's come up.

30:55.063 --> 30:56.731
We're kicking it around.

30:56.814 --> 30:58.524
A while back, I made a vision board.

30:58.608 --> 31:04.072
To manifest my need for community,
I cut out a picture of a park bench

31:04.155 --> 31:05.406
and I pasted that on there.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.116
Fuck this fuck bench!

31:07.200 --> 31:09.619
You're doing great! [laughing]

31:09.702 --> 31:12.455
What time is it?
That's my eight hours.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.041
Okay, that's Oscar. [chuckling]

31:15.124 --> 31:17.710
He's one of the wonderful, angry...

31:18.336 --> 31:21.589
angry, wonderful people
in our neighborhood.

31:21.672 --> 31:22.965
What should I do, Patton?

31:23.049 --> 31:24.425
-Hands off the mic.
-Okay.

31:24.509 --> 31:27.053
[inhaling]
Ladies and gentlemen, Patton Oswalt!

31:27.136 --> 31:28.262
He can do comedy!

31:28.346 --> 31:29.722
[cheering]

31:29.806 --> 31:32.767
-[crowd whooping]
-Because it's not his show!

31:32.850 --> 31:34.977
[Mark] Thanks a lot.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.562
-Hey, guys.
-[gunshot]

31:36.646 --> 31:39.857
Well, I know a lot of you guys
are pissed off.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.110
I've been pissed off all day, you know?

31:42.193 --> 31:44.737
And here's the thing
about being pissed off

31:44.821 --> 31:47.240
is if you're really pissed off,

31:47.323 --> 31:49.367
the joke's probably on you.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.119
[all laughing]

31:53.037 --> 31:56.332
Oh, honey, wake up, wake up.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.584
[sighs] Your purple van's almost here.

31:58.668 --> 32:00.378
No, they're not coming.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.380
They're never coming again.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.090
Not after badminton.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.718
[Patton] <i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>if you piss people off,</i>

32:07.802 --> 32:10.721
<i>what matters is the people</i>
<i>who show up after that.</i>

32:10.805 --> 32:13.516
-[gasps]
<i>-Those are the people to hang on to.</i>

32:14.559 --> 32:16.185
They're here.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.440
I need my backpack!

32:24.152 --> 32:26.195
[Patton] <i>Real friends</i>
<i>are there for you.</i>

32:26.279 --> 32:27.822
<i>And you're there for them.</i>

32:27.905 --> 32:29.949
With the exception of my friend Maria,

32:30.032 --> 32:33.202
who I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be there for.

32:33.286 --> 32:35.079
-Guys, look...
-[Maria chuckles]

32:35.163 --> 32:38.332
So it looks like love isn't gonna find me
anytime soon.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.585
Or friendship and community.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.337
But you know what?
I'm on a journey.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.507
My show seems like
it's really finding its own voice.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.092
Hey, apropos of nothing,

32:48.176 --> 32:51.095
do you guys love or hate
the term "gun nuts"?

32:51.179 --> 32:52.472
-[bullet ricocheting]
-Okay.

32:53.431 --> 32:56.434
It's Patton's voice.
But he is very good.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.687
...express how you feel,
whether it's good or bad.

32:59.770 --> 33:04.066
And do not let people force you
to do what you don't wanna do!

33:04.150 --> 33:05.610
[woman] Like this bench!

33:05.693 --> 33:09.697
Yes, there you go! Thank you!
Don't get pissed off at each other.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.073
Get pissed off at the bench.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.659
-[all cheering]
-[woman] That's right!

33:13.743 --> 33:15.703
[man] Take down this wooden abortion.

33:15.786 --> 33:16.954
-Yeah!
-Come on!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.289
Whoo!

33:20.291 --> 33:21.417
[Maria] My bench!

33:21.501 --> 33:24.045
It's bringing people together!

33:24.128 --> 33:26.881
Vision board! [laughing]

33:29.342 --> 33:31.511
Boom! Manifested.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.138
<i> ♪ I don't know what I'm doing ♪</i>

33:34.222 --> 33:35.681
[Maria] Yeah!

33:37.767 --> 33:40.478
<i>♪ More than half of the time ♪</i>

33:40.561 --> 33:42.730
[laughing] Good job.
