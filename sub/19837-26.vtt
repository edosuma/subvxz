<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:08.350 --> 02:13.360
<b>Then x And x After</b>

02:13.360 --> 02:17.110
<b>"Dear Mito-san and Grandma, 
how are you doing?</b>

02:17.110 --> 02:19.500
<b>I'm doing great, as always.</b>

02:20.580 --> 02:25.320
<b>So, I actually passed the Hunter Exam.</b>

02:28.010 --> 02:31.130
<b>While I managed to pass the exam,</b>

02:32.180 --> 02:34.810
<b>I'm not too happy about it.</b>

02:38.340 --> 02:41.220
<b>That's because of what happened 
during the Final Phase."</b>

02:43.550 --> 02:46.680
<b>You really don't get it...</b>

02:47.320 --> 02:50.230
<b>If you die, you'll never get another chance.</b>

02:50.850 --> 02:54.450
<b>If I kill you here,</b>

02:54.450 --> 02:57.820
<b>I need only try again next year.</b>

02:58.450 --> 03:00.610
<b>We are not on equal footing!</b>

03:06.510 --> 03:09.120
<b>You value your pride more 
than your own life?!</b>

03:09.120 --> 03:12.000
<b>You're really willing to die for your pride?!</b>

03:12.680 --> 03:14.960
<b>I'm going to find my dad.</b>

03:16.510 --> 03:18.490
<b>My dad is a Hunter.</b>

03:18.950 --> 03:23.590
<b>So I'm going to become a Hunter 
and find him!</b>

03:24.540 --> 03:26.970
<b>I believe that I'll find him one day...</b>

03:28.980 --> 03:32.450
<b>But I have a feeling that if I give up now,</b>

03:32.450 --> 03:34.490
<b>I'll never find him!</b>

03:37.840 --> 03:39.460
<b>So I won't surrender.</b>

03:40.710 --> 03:43.990
<b>If you don't yield, you'll die...</b>

03:49.420 --> 03:51.410
<b><i>He defies reason.</i></b>

03:57.410 --> 03:59.920
<b>I give up. You win.</b>

04:00.730 --> 04:01.800
<b>That's not fair!</b>

04:02.810 --> 04:06.050
<b>We both have to think of 
a way to settle this fight!</b>

04:06.050 --> 04:07.810
<b>You fool!</b>

04:10.410 --> 04:13.060
<b>"He knocked me out.</b>

04:13.060 --> 04:15.810
<b>So Satotz-san had to tell me</b>

04:15.810 --> 04:17.730
<b>what had happened next."</b>

04:20.100 --> 04:20.900
<b>Begin!</b>

04:21.700 --> 04:23.570
<b>It's been too long, Kil.</b>

04:47.080 --> 04:48.390
<b>Brother...</b>

04:51.060 --> 04:53.360

<b>You were born to be...</b>

<b>a killer.</b>

05:02.840 --> 05:06.280
<b>What would you accomplish 
by becoming a Hunter?</b>

05:08.060 --> 05:09.310
<b>True,</b>

05:09.870 --> 05:13.160
<b>I don't desire to become a Hunter.</b>

05:13.360 --> 05:14.520
<b>But...</b>

05:15.580 --> 05:18.670
<b>I do have something I want...</b>

05:19.030 --> 05:19.750
<b>You don't.</b>

05:19.750 --> 05:20.890
<b>I do!</b>

05:20.890 --> 05:23.010
<b>There's something I really want!</b>

05:24.690 --> 05:27.550
<b>Tell me what it is that you want.</b>

05:33.380 --> 05:37.020
<b>I want to become friends with Gon...</b>

05:41.100 --> 05:44.800
<b>I'm sick of killing people...</b>

05:45.490 --> 05:47.670
<b>I want to become friends with Gon,</b>

05:48.500 --> 05:50.190
<b>and to live a normal life...</b>

05:50.950 --> 05:52.080
<b>That's impossible.</b>

05:53.700 --> 05:56.620
<b>You'll never be able to make friends.</b>

05:58.230 --> 06:02.500
<b>Because you have the soul of a killer.</b>

06:05.490 --> 06:09.760
<b>If you move an inch, I'll assume 
that the fight has begun.</b>

06:10.430 --> 06:13.130
<b>And if our bodies make contact,</b>

06:13.130 --> 06:16.520
<b>that will also mean the fight has begun.</b>

06:16.890 --> 06:19.100
<b>If you don't fight me,</b>

06:19.490 --> 06:22.230
<b>your dear Gon will die.</b>

06:30.470 --> 06:31.550
<b>I surrender.</b>

06:32.600 --> 06:35.370
<b>I lose...</b>

06:38.990 --> 06:42.760
<b>"Killua gave in to his despair after that."</b>

07:10.270 --> 07:12.060
<b>Apologize to Killua!</b>

07:13.210 --> 07:15.950
<b>Apologize? For what?</b>

07:16.290 --> 07:18.200
<b>You don't know what you did wrong?</b>

07:30.040 --> 07:32.000
<b>Don't bother apologizing.</b>

07:32.000 --> 07:34.880
<b>Just take me to see Killua.</b>

07:34.880 --> 07:36.530
<b>What will you do then?</b>

07:37.020 --> 07:38.560
<b>That should be obvious...</b>

07:39.150 --> 07:40.960
<b>I'm gonna rescue Killua!</b>

07:42.760 --> 07:46.160
<b>"After that, Kurapika, Leorio, and I</b>

<b>went to Kukuroo Mountain,

<b>Anyone who cannot open this gate</b>

<b>Listen to me, Gon-kun.</b>

08:11.590 --> 08:14.550
<b>You three are allowed to work together</b>

08:14.550 --> 08:16.350
<b>to open the door.</b>

08:17.360 --> 08:20.600
<b>With a little training, it should be possible.</b>

08:25.140 --> 08:26.480
<b>Let's do this, Kurapika!</b>

08:28.240 --> 08:29.940
<b>Right, let's push!</b>

08:30.480 --> 08:31.280
<b>Here we go!</b>

08:31.590 --> 08:32.280
<b>One!</b>

08:32.580 --> 08:33.280
<b>Two!</b>

08:33.280 --> 08:34.150
<b>Three!</b>

08:41.450 --> 08:43.140
<b>Ow...</b>

08:48.330 --> 08:49.660
<b>It opened.</b>

08:50.460 --> 08:52.410
<b>Yes!</b>

08:52.410 --> 08:54.140
<b>We did it, Gon!</b>

08:54.140 --> 08:55.430
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

09:00.180 --> 09:01.680
<b>Leave.</b>

09:02.010 --> 09:04.440
<b>You're trespassing on private property.</b>

09:04.800 --> 09:07.940
<b>I cannot allow you to pass

09:08.420 --> 09:10.510
<b>If you take one step beyond this line,</b>

09:10.510 --> 09:11.940
<b>I'll remove you by force.</b>

09:18.430 --> 09:20.200
<b>What's the problem?</b>

09:20.620 --> 09:22.950
<b>I'm just here to see my friend.</b>

09:23.560 --> 09:25.960
<b>I'm just here to see Killua!</b>

09:27.290 --> 09:30.500
<b>Why do I have to do this?!</b>

09:39.730 --> 09:42.140
<b>You're different from Mike.</b>

09:42.780 --> 09:45.400
<b>You may try to hide your feelings,</b>

09:45.400 --> 09:46.890
<b>but you have a heart.</b>

09:47.460 --> 09:52.270
<b>When I mentioned Killua, 
your eyes softened for a moment.</b>

10:00.530 --> 10:01.660
<b>Please...</b>

10:03.150 --> 10:06.580
<b>Help Killua-samaâ€”</b>

10:15.880 --> 10:17.310
<b>You must be Gon.</b>

10:17.310 --> 10:19.890
<b>I heard about you from Illumi.</b>

10:19.890 --> 10:23.640
<b>Killua knows that you're here.</b>

10:25.350 --> 10:29.020
<b>Why can't Killua come see us?</b>

10:29.540 --> 10:31.520
<b>Because he's in solitary confinement.</b>

10:31.520 --> 10:32.820
<b>Solitary confinement?</b>

10:33.960 --> 10:39.070
<b>Kil returned because he regretted his actions.</b>

10:39.890 --> 10:43.610
<b>And he voluntarily entered 
solitary confinement.</b>

10:46.680 --> 10:47.830
<b>I will take you</b>

10:48.360 --> 10:50.830
<b>to the butler's office.</b>

10:50.830 --> 10:55.070
<b>There is a phone that connects to the mansion.</b>

10:55.640 --> 10:58.980
<b>If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...</b>

11:03.970 --> 11:05.560
<b>Well? Which hand?</b>

11:06.040 --> 11:09.800
<b>I have known Killua-sama his entire life.</b>

11:09.800 --> 11:13.060
<b>I dare say that I care for him 
as though he were my own.</b>

11:13.060 --> 11:14.980
<b>In all honesty,</b>

11:15.570 --> 11:18.940
<b>I must despise you for trying 
to take him away.</b>

11:26.630 --> 11:30.000
<b>If one of you answers incorrectly, 
that person is out of the games.</b>

11:30.590 --> 11:32.710
<b>Should you all be disqualified,</b>

11:32.710 --> 11:36.800
<b>I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.</b>

11:37.430 --> 11:40.590
<b>And that he will never see you again.</b>

11:41.560 --> 11:42.480
<b>Here I go.</b>

11:42.480 --> 11:43.550
<b>One second!</b>

11:45.170 --> 11:46.540
<b>What is it?</b>

11:46.540 --> 11:49.390
<b>If you're trying to buy time, 
I'll kill one of your friends.</b>

11:56.150 --> 11:57.230
<b><i>That's it...</i></b>

11:57.230 --> 11:59.020
<b><i>He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.</i></b>

12:01.030 --> 12:02.610
<b>Okay!</b>

12:02.610 --> 12:03.770
<b>Now I can see.</b>

12:03.770 --> 12:04.910
<b>Give me your best!</b>

12:14.220 --> 12:16.380
<b>Who now holds the coin?</b>

12:20.600 --> 12:22.960
<b>The person right behind me.</b>

12:29.280 --> 12:30.450
<b>Brilliant.</b>

12:32.490 --> 12:34.270
<b>Gotoh, is Gon here yet?</b>

12:34.270 --> 12:35.290
<b>Killua!</b>

12:35.290 --> 12:37.460
<b>Oh! You're here, Gon!</b>

12:37.460 --> 12:39.080
<b>Along with...</b>

12:39.080 --> 12:39.990
<b>Kurapika?</b>

12:39.990 --> 12:41.510
<b>I'm just an afterthought?</b>

12:41.510 --> 12:42.660
<b>Liorio!</b>

12:42.660 --> 12:44.240
<b>Leorio!</b>

12:45.140 --> 12:46.220
<b>It's been a while.</b>

12:46.220 --> 12:48.490
<b>I can't believe you came. 
What happened?</b>

12:48.490 --> 12:49.790
<b>Your face is a wreck!</b>

12:50.680 --> 12:51.910
<b>Yours isn't any better!</b>

12:55.640 --> 12:57.540
<b>"And just like that,</b>

12:57.540 --> 12:59.290
<b>we managed to rescue Killua.</b>

13:01.730 --> 13:04.540
<b>However, there is one more piece</b>

13:04.540 --> 13:08.350
<b>of business I must take care of, Mito-san."</b>

<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

<b>"The business I still need to take care of</b>

13:24.740 --> 13:26.800
<b>is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase."</b>

13:33.770 --> 13:37.710
<b>I will need you to draw lots.</b>

13:37.980 --> 13:39.270
<b>Lots?</b>

13:39.270 --> 13:41.460
<b>For what?</b>

13:43.770 --> 13:46.220
<b>To determine who will hunt 
and who will be hunted.</b>

13:46.220 --> 13:47.720
<b>Listen carefully!</b>

13:49.280 --> 13:54.220
<b>Your target's ID tag is worth three points.</b>

13:54.930 --> 13:57.980
<b>Your own ID is also worth three points.</b>

13:58.470 --> 14:01.730
<b>All other ID tags are worth one point.</b>

14:02.070 --> 14:06.860
<b>You need six points to advance 
to the Final Phase.</b>

14:07.190 --> 14:09.860
<b>So while on Zevil Island,</b>

14:09.860 --> 14:13.640
<b>you must gather enough ID tags 
to total six points.</b>

14:15.250 --> 14:19.880
<b>That is the condition for clearing 
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.</b>

14:23.290 --> 14:26.340
<b>What number did you draw?</b>

14:29.110 --> 14:31.490
<b>Show each other our numbers

14:31.870 --> 14:32.850
<b>Okay!</b>

14:33.590 --> 14:34.850
<b>Ready, and...</b>

14:37.600 --> 14:39.340
<b>#44 is...</b>

14:43.040 --> 14:44.360
<b>Seriously?</b>

14:45.080 --> 14:47.740
<b>In a straight-up fight,</b>

14:47.740 --> 14:50.110
<b>I wouldn't stand a chance.</b>

14:50.690 --> 14:53.800
<b>But if I only need to steal his ID tag,</b>

14:53.800 --> 14:56.810
<b>then I have a real shot.</b>

14:57.340 --> 14:58.290
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:59.180 --> 15:02.590
<b>I might actually have a chance.</b>

15:03.560 --> 15:06.800
<b>That scares me a little...</b>

15:07.540 --> 15:09.200
<b>But I think it's worth it.</b>

15:26.800 --> 15:27.610
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

15:31.860 --> 15:33.460
<b>I did it!</b>

15:33.960 --> 15:35.580

15:35.580 --> 15:39.590
<b><i>I have to aim for my target as

15:53.970 --> 15:54.960
<b><i>There!</i></b>

<b><i>At this rate, Hisoka will spot him

18:24.380 --> 18:25.300
<b><i>I did it...</i></b>

18:25.300 --> 18:28.500
<b><i>I took Hisoka's tag!</i></b>

18:37.720 --> 18:39.720
<b>Approximately, seven thousand.</b>

18:40.460 --> 18:44.220
<b>Do you know what that

<b>The number of chances

18:52.350 --> 18:54.910
<b>It's also the number of times you swung</b>

<b>your fishing rod when you were training.</b>

<b>Damn it...</b>

<b>You surprise me.</b>

<b>You hid your presence,

<b>Waiting for me to attack another?</b>

19:33.940 --> 19:36.800
<b>Did you teach yourself how

19:36.800 --> 19:38.370
<b>Marvelous...</b>

19:38.370 --> 19:40.560
<b>Like a wild animal.</b>

19:41.170 --> 19:43.440
<b>And your timing was impeccable.</b>

19:43.960 --> 19:47.040
<b>You concealed all traces of your attack</b>

19:47.040 --> 19:50.960
<b>by timing it with my own attack.</b>

19:51.450 --> 19:53.030
<b>A splendid job.</b>

19:56.200 --> 19:57.440
<b>Wait...</b>

20:00.350 --> 20:06.220
<b>Didn't you come to take back your tag?</b>

20:06.220 --> 20:09.220
<b>No, I just came to commend you.</b>

20:09.830 --> 20:11.020
<b>You owe me one now.</b>

<b>Feel free to pay me back when you want.</b>

<b>I don't want to owe anyone...</b>

<b>You can have it back now.</b>

20:34.000 --> 20:35.210
<b>I refuse.</b>

20:36.440 --> 20:39.210
<b>Right now, I'm letting you live.</b>

20:39.530 --> 20:43.720
<b>And I'll continue to keep you alive,</b>

20:43.720 --> 20:47.720
<b>until you've grown enough 
to be worth killing...</b>

20:56.030 --> 20:57.660
<b>I'll only take it back</b>

20:57.660 --> 21:01.490
<b>when you're able to punch me 
in the face, just like that.</b>

21:02.160 --> 21:06.490
<b>Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.</b>

21:09.660 --> 21:13.740
<b>"It's the first time I've ever 
felt that frustrated.</b>

21:14.370 --> 21:18.070
<b>So I need to find a way to return the favor.</b>

21:19.630 --> 21:23.450
<b>I can't return to Whale Island 
until that's done.</b>

21:25.500 --> 21:29.890
<b>That's why I'll be going to 
Heavens Arena with Killua,</b>

21:29.890 --> 21:32.640
<b>to train as a Hunter.</b>

21:32.940 --> 21:35.870
<b>Please take care until I get back.</b>

21:36.450 --> 21:37.900
<b>Gon Freecss."</b>

21:42.420 --> 21:45.440
<b>I didn't expect him home anytime soon.</b>

21:46.660 --> 21:48.800
<b>He really is your son...</b>

21:52.560 --> 21:56.080
<b>Are you watching over him,</b>

21:56.970 --> 21:58.200
<b>Ging?</b>

23:28.590 --> 23:30.840
<b>Next time: Arrival x At The x Arena!</b>

23:30.840 --> 23:32.010
<b>Off we go!</b>

23:32.010 --> 23:32.930
<b>Gon Gon!</b>

23:32.930 --> 23:34.290
<b>Again?</b>
