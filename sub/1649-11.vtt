WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:06.204
( panting )

00:06.382 --> 00:08.919
(grunts, crying)

00:20.146 --> 00:23.354
- I told you--
- You ain't told me shit!

00:24.859 --> 00:27.851
I barely knew those guys.
I met 'em on the road.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.020
How many in your group?

00:34.327 --> 00:36.568
Uh,no,no,no,no,
no,no,no,no,no.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.282
Come on, man.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.946
H - Ah!
ow many?!

00:40.124 --> 00:42.285
Uh, 30.
30. 30 guys.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.745
-Where?
- Uh...

00:43.920 --> 00:45.410
( screams )

00:45.588 --> 00:47.453
I don't know. I swear.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.372
We were never anyplace
more than a night.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.087
Scouﬁng?
Planning on staying local?

00:52.261 --> 00:54.547
I don't know.
They left me behind.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.054
- Did you ever pick off a scab?
- Come on, man!

00:57.225 --> 00:58.806
I'm trying to cooperate.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.932
Start real slow at first.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.684
Sooner or later,
you've just gotta rip it off.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.891
Okay. Okay.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.977
( stammers )
They have weapons--

01:07.151 --> 01:09.233
heavy stuff, automatics.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.520
(stammers)
But I didn't do anything.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.735
Your boys shot at my boys,
tried to take this farm.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.275
You just went along for the ride?

01:17.453 --> 01:18.693
You're trying to tell me
you're innocent?

01:18.871 --> 01:21.112
Yes!

01:21.290 --> 01:23.326
These-- these people
took me in.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.493
Notjust guys--
a whole group of 'em.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.457
Men and women,

01:28.631 --> 01:30.713
kids, too--
just like you people.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.420
Thought I'd have a better chance
with them, you know?

01:33.594 --> 01:34.970
But...

01:36.055 --> 01:38.341
we go out, scavenge--

01:38.516 --> 01:40.427
just the men.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.094
One night we-- we found
this little campsite.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.805
A man and his
two daughters--

01:47.984 --> 01:49.565
teenagers, you know?

01:49.735 --> 01:53.193
Real young.
Real cute.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.488
Their daddy had to watch
while these guys, they--

02:05.126 --> 02:07.242
And they didn't
even kill him afterwards.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.127
They just--
they just made him watch

02:10.298 --> 02:11.663
as his daughters--

02:13.092 --> 02:15.799
They just-just--
just left him there.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.801
No, but-but--
but I didn't touch those girls.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.556
No, I swear
I didn't to--

02:22.727 --> 02:25.560
( groans )
Please.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.597
Please.
You gotta believe me, man.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.856
I'm not like that.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.977
I ain't like that.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.737
Please. Please,
you gotta believe me.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.284
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

02:40.870 --> 02:43.407
(theme music playing )

03:17.365 --> 03:18.980
So what you gonna do?

03:19.158 --> 03:20.944
We'd all feel better
if we knew the plan.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.155
- Andrea: Is there a plan?
- Glenn: We gonna keep him here?

03:26.040 --> 03:29.328
- We'll know soon enough.
- ( footsteps approaching )

03:33.923 --> 03:37.290
Boy there's got
a gang, 30 men.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.585
They got heavy artillery and they
ain't looking to make friends.

03:40.763 --> 03:44.255
They roll through here,
our boys are dead.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.095
And our women, they're gonna--
they're gonna wish they were.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.009
What did you do?

03:50.022 --> 03:51.728
Had a little chat.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.065
Rick:
No one goes near this guy.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.978
Lori:
Rick, what are you gonna do?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.817
We have no choice.
He's a threat.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.199
We have to
eliminate the threat.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.531
You'rejust gonna kill him?

04:06.705 --> 04:09.447
It's settled.
I'll do it today.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.664
You can't do this.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.704
You don't wanna do this.
I know you don't.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.338
I thought about it
all night.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.500
Knowing what we know now,
I don't see a way out of it.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.135
But you can'tjust decide on your
own to take someone's life.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.387
The group seemed supportive.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.095
Because they didn't speak back?
You didn't let 'em.

04:29.979 --> 04:33.767
There's gotta be a process.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.976
And what would that be?

04:35.151 --> 04:36.891
We can't call witnesses,
go before a judge.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.900
So he's automatically
guilty by association

04:39.071 --> 04:40.902
and sentenced to death?

04:41.073 --> 04:42.734
He's just a kid.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.696
Give me some time
to talk to everyone.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.953
' Try t0 figure out another way--
- No, we can't drag this out.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.363
People are scared.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.156
Which is why they need time
to discuss this.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.245
No, no, no,
they need to be safe.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.287
- I owe 'em that.
- You think about your son.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.460
The message that
you're giving him--

05:00.634 --> 05:02.215
shoot first, think later.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.254
I'm asking for one day
to talk to everybody.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.596
You can give me that.
Think about Carl.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.475
lam.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.900
We reconvene at sunset,
then what happens happens.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.107
(thunder rumbling)

05:29.788 --> 05:33.030
- I need a favor.
- Did you move the gun bag?

05:33.209 --> 05:34.995
Yeah.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.882
I need you to guard Randall,

05:44.053 --> 05:45.668
protect him.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.347
Why?

05:47.515 --> 05:49.597
Rick's giving me time
to talk to the others,

05:49.767 --> 05:51.303
try and talk
some sense into them.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.388
But if Shane finds out--

05:53.562 --> 05:55.223
You think he'll just shoot
the guy himself?

05:55.397 --> 05:58.184
You know killing the boy
had to be his idea.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.107
Are you with him on this?

06:02.780 --> 06:06.272
He's a threat.
Tell me this isn't all the ammo.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.071
You're a Civil Rights lawyer.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.486
Was.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.747
You fight with words,
the power of ideas.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.579
Using a gun,
that's his way.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.460
You really want to debate
about saving a guy

06:20.631 --> 06:22.872
who will lead his buddies
right to our door?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.836
That's what
a civilized society does.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.546
Who says
we're civilized anymore?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.421
No, the world
we knew is gone,

06:30.599 --> 06:33.386
but keeping
our humanity?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.768
That's a choice.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.283
I'll watch your prisoner.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.617
But not because
I think you're right.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.369
(straining)

07:07.511 --> 07:08.842
Hello?

07:10.139 --> 07:11.629
Hey.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.468
Can I get some water?

07:13.642 --> 07:15.678
Please?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.140
I'm very thirsty.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.028
They're gonna
kill me, right?

07:39.335 --> 07:41.121
Carl:
So he's a kid?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.667
He ain't a kid.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.585
That was a figure of speech.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.504
- Carl: Can I see him?
- Shane: No.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.550
Look, man, this is--
this is grown-up stuff, all right?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.973
You just-- you just
let us handle this.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.236
( chuckles )

08:13.410 --> 08:14.866
Dale, huh?

08:15.037 --> 08:16.902
What, he put you
on death watch?

08:17.081 --> 08:19.948
Let me ask you something--
say I wanted to go in there right now

08:20.125 --> 08:23.037
and ljust wanted to take care of this,
you gonna stop me?

08:23.212 --> 08:24.873
I had a good teacher.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.537
Yeah.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.626
So what...

08:30.886 --> 08:32.877
you buy
into Dale's sob story?

08:33.055 --> 08:34.886
ltold him lwas
with you on this.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.924
Mmm. You're just
still here for him, huh?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.722
That's cute.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.439
These guys ain't gonna
go through with this.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.270
I'm telling you,
they gonna--

08:47.444 --> 08:49.105
they gonna pussy out.
And if they do,

08:49.279 --> 08:50.940
we gonna have
a big problem on our hands.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.445
Let me ask you something-- every time
we have a problem around here,

08:55.619 --> 08:57.655
- who do you think's behind it?
- Some might say you.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.412
( chuckles )
No one listens to me.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.833
I say it's the guys
that make up the rules,

09:05.003 --> 09:06.584
the ones that always have
all the answers,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.620
even though their answers
always prove wrong.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.666
So what are you gonna do?
Rick's the leader of this group.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.960
- It's Hershel's farm.
- Maybe we oughta change that.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.471
What, are you gonna lock 'em in
a room and take their guns?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.432
I don't know.
That could get out of hand.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.437
No, no, it won't. Okay?
I won't let it.

09:26.608 --> 09:30.317
Listen, I don't-- I don't want
anybody to get hurt, okay?

09:30.487 --> 09:33.354
Rick's my friend, Hershel--
he's all right by me.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.274
- And Dale?
- Dale got a big mouth,

09:36.452 --> 09:38.158
but he's harmless.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.616
Look, ljust-- I wanna know
what it's like to sleep

09:41.790 --> 09:43.371
without keeping
one eye open.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.658
Ain't that--
ain't that what we all want?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.827
(wood creaking )

09:48.005 --> 09:50.462
Shane: The ball's in their court.
Maybe I'm wrong.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.668
Maybe I'm getting
all worked up over nothing.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.549
Hey.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.797
That's a sweet hat.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.808
l'm Randall.
What's your name?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.807
The sheriff guy--
that your dad?

10:06.982 --> 10:08.483
I like him.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.392
Yeah, he's a good guy.
I can tell.

10:13.489 --> 10:15.070
Your mom out here, too?

10:16.992 --> 10:19.483
You're-- you're lucky
you still got your family.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.162
I lost mine.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.822
Hey, |-- I don't know what people
have been saying about me,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.992
but I didn't do nothing.
I swear.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.913
Your dad was gonna let me go till
his friend started fighting with him.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.836
It got pretty bad.
l was kinda worried.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.006
My camp,
we got lots of supplies.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.927
You help me, I'll take you and your
folks back to my people.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.679
We'll take good care of you.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.848
Keep you safe.
You just got to--

10:51.026 --> 10:53.187
just got to help me
get out of here, okay?

10:53.362 --> 10:57.571
Just help me pick these locks
or find the key, okay?

10:57.741 --> 11:00.198
Come on, please?
Please?

11:00.369 --> 11:01.950
( door opens)

11:02.120 --> 11:04.202
What the hell are you doing in here?
What did you say to him?

11:04.373 --> 11:06.739
- What did you say to him, huh?
- I didn't say nothing.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.124
- I will shoot you where you sit.
- Okay, Shane, not now.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.830
- Open your mouth.
- Shane.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.710
You like talking, man?
You like talking?!

11:12.881 --> 11:14.291
Andrea:
Back off!

11:18.762 --> 11:21.378
Get your ass out this door.
Let's go.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.889
- What the hell you doing?
- Please don't tell my parents.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.301
Carl, that ain't cool, man.
You could've gotten hurt in there.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.470
- I can handle myself.
- Let me tell you something--

11:29.648 --> 11:32.060
you do not go near him again.
Do you hear me?

11:32.234 --> 11:33.724
Damn it.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.858
You won't tell
my parents, will you?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.565
Carl, man,

11:37.739 --> 11:39.650
it ain't about getting
in trouble, okay?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.235
A guy like that,
he will say anything to you.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.576
He'll try to make you
get your guard down.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.612
You let your guard down
out here, people die.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.656
Now, just--

11:49.835 --> 11:52.872
do me a favor, man.
Go find your ma. Go on.

11:54.673 --> 11:58.632
Carl, quit trying
to get yourself killed, man.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.988
Oh! The whole point
of me coming up here

12:22.159 --> 12:25.026
- is to get away from you people.
- Gonna take more than that.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.282
Carol send you?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.493
Carol's not the only one
that's concerned about you,

12:30.667 --> 12:32.703
your new role in the group.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.335
Oh, man, I don't need
my head shrunk.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.632
This group's broken.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.836
I'm better off
fending for myself.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.378
- You act like you don't care.
- Yeah, it's 'cause I don't.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.432
So live or die, you don't care
what happens to Randall?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.473
- Nope.
- Then why not stand with me,

12:52.648 --> 12:55.560
try to save the kid's life, if it really
doesn't matter one way or the other?

12:55.734 --> 12:58.225
Didn't peg you
for a desperate son of a bitch.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.894
Your opinion makes
a difference.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.859
Man, ain't nobody looking
at me for nothing.

13:03.033 --> 13:07.652
Carol is, and lam.
Right now.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.615
And you obviously--
you have Rick's ear.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.157
Rick just looks to Shane.
Let him.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.502
You cared about
what happened to Sophia...

13:19.633 --> 13:21.498
cared what
it meant to the group.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.174
Torturing people?
That isn't you.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.010
You're a decent man.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.095
So is Rick.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.304
Shane is different.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.519
Why's that?
'Cause he killed Otis?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.153
- He tell you that?
- He told some story--

13:43.323 --> 13:46.315
how Otis covered him,
saved his ass.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.529
He showed up
with the dead guy's gun.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.696
Rick ain't stupid.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.034
If he didn't figure that out,
it's 'cause he didn't wanna.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.747
It's like I said--
group's broken.

14:07.723 --> 14:11.215
Baby, where's your daddy?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.388
- He's up there.
- All right.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.695
So...

14:32.873 --> 14:35.910
the nights are getting colder
and we're pretty exposed.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.416
- l was thinking--
- Maybe we could clear this place out,

14:38.587 --> 14:41.920
station lookouts up here.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.209
- Uh...
- Or we could talk to Hershel

14:46.386 --> 14:47.887
about staying
in the house.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.091
- Yeah.
- All right.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.259
Lori: Is that really
the best way to do this?

14:55.437 --> 14:58.770
To string him up?

14:58.940 --> 15:00.441
l have no idea.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.600
It's my first time.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.571
Look, I know how you feel
about the death penalty, but--

15:08.742 --> 15:10.983
And I know
the world has changed.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.776
After everything
that's happened,

15:12.954 --> 15:14.945
you and Shane agree on this.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.954
So you support
this decision?

15:17.959 --> 15:20.211
If you think it's best.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.960
You never did tell me what happened
on the road with you and Shane.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.131
He won't be
a problem anymore.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.066
You know, we'll see Sophia
again in heaven some day.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.941
She's in a better place.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.948
No, she's not.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.614
Heaven is
just another lie.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.829
And if you believe it,
you're an idiot.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.338
You need to
control that boy.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.383
- Rick: Carl? What happened?
- He's disrespectful.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.348
- Did he say something?
- Something cruel about Sophia.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.763
- We'll figure it out. It's okay.
- It's not okay.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.182
I'll have--
I'll have a talk with him.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.435
See? We'||-- we'll--

16:28.613 --> 16:30.695
we'll deal with it.
If you can calm down, so that I can--

16:30.866 --> 16:32.982
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- No, |-- I don't--

16:33.160 --> 16:36.277
I don't need you to patronize me.
Everyone either avoids me

16:36.454 --> 16:38.319
or they treat me
like I'm crazy.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.205
I lost my daughter.
I didn't lose my mind!

16:44.713 --> 16:48.456
Rick:
Carl, come over here.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.549
Did you talk back
to Carol?

16:51.720 --> 16:54.006
- No.
- She says you did.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.047
You can't talk back
to people like that.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.468
I said it's stupid
to believe in heaven.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.350
'Cause it is.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.979
Well, just think
about that for a minute.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.314
She just lost
her daughter.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.275
She wants to believe
she's still alive in some way.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.906
- But she--
- Don't.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.818
Don't talk.
Think.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.245
It's a good
rule of thumb for life.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.156
Mom always wants you
to talk more.

17:23.335 --> 17:24.916
Don't change
the subject.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.213
You owe Carol an apology.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.996
You made a mistake.
Fix it.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.166
Is that why you're
gonna kill that guy?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.711
Fixing your mistake?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.926
That's different.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.514
How are you gonna do it?
Are you gonna hang him in the barn?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.680
You just think about how you're
gonna make things right with Carol.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.895
Don't talk. Think.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.358
- You got it?
- Yeah.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.941
Dale:
What happened?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.653
A dozen steer busted
through the fence.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.785
Been wrangling
the runaways all morning.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.451
But you're not here
to talk cattle.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.708
- The boy.
- The prisoner.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.711
- Randall.
- I don't want to know.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.543
I'm told they're
deciding his fate.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.007
I'll leave it with Rick.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.169
But this is your home.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.713
I want him away
from my girls.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.677
I don't care how.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.059
- It's an execution.
- I don't want to know.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.642
But you can't stand
by the sidelines.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.807
You're a man
with convictions.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.850
To tell you
the truth, I was.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.859
Or at least
I thought I was.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.567
But I've made
too many mistakes.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.281
Would you at least talk with Randall
before making up your mind?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.615
No. I'll leave it with Rick.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.426
(flies buzzing )

20:07.290 --> 20:09.406
(walker growling )

20:26.101 --> 20:28.262
( growls )

20:30.355 --> 20:32.562
( gasps )

21:04.013 --> 21:06.095
(growling)

21:43.094 --> 21:45.085
What's up, Dale?

21:47.682 --> 21:49.547
(sighs)

21:49.726 --> 21:51.591
I want to change
your mind.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.602
( laughs )
What, you serious?

21:54.772 --> 21:58.230
I know you and I will never see
eye to eye on much.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.187
I'd say that's the understatement
of the year, huh?

22:00.361 --> 22:01.976
But...

22:03.406 --> 22:05.362
- you're not going anywhere.
- No.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.283
- And I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.992
So let's talk
about this like men.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.956
Okay.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.368
You deny
we're in danger, Dale?

22:18.546 --> 22:20.923
No, but there's
a dozen of us,

22:21.090 --> 22:23.172
one of him.

22:26.346 --> 22:30.214
- No.
- But it changes us.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.638
( laughs)

22:34.812 --> 22:37.098
You got balls, Dale.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.809
I'm gonna give you that.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.689
Now...

22:42.445 --> 22:45.061
I'll tell you what--
in a little bit when y'all gather,

22:45.240 --> 22:47.196
you're gonna talk
about this.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.110
If you've convinced them
to keep this guy alive,

22:51.287 --> 22:54.029
I ain't gonna say
a damn word about it, okay?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.289
But I'm telling you now,
man to man,

22:57.460 --> 22:59.166
you're wrong.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.961
And when this guy
kills somebody

23:02.131 --> 23:03.667
I ain't gonna need
to say anything,

23:03.841 --> 23:06.924
because that blood--
that's gonna be on you.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.096
You're wrong about this, Dale.
You're dead wrong.

23:15.603 --> 23:16.843
Go back home.

23:17.021 --> 23:20.309
Doodlebug, Doodlebug,
go away home.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.270
- Doodlebug.
- Doodlebug, Doodlebug, go away home.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.026
( both chuckle )

23:27.365 --> 23:28.571
How is she?

23:28.741 --> 23:31.153
She seems to be in
good spirits today.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.443
Aren't you, Doodlebug?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.955
Well, let me know
if I can do anything.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.628
Where's your family from?

23:48.636 --> 23:50.172
Michigan.

23:50.346 --> 23:54.055
But before that, Korea.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.346
Immigrants built
this country.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.307
Never forget that.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.473
Our family came
from Ireland.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.643
( chuckles )
Maggie Greene-- I kinda figured.

24:10.074 --> 24:14.363
My grandfather brought this over
from the old country.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.620
He passed it on to my father,
who passed it on to me.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.374
l pawned it to pay for a night of
drinking | no longer remember.

24:21.544 --> 24:25.128
-( both chuckle)
- You bought it back.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.458
My late wife did--
Josephine,

24:29.636 --> 24:31.501
Maggie's mother.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.546
She gave it back
years later

24:34.724 --> 24:36.430
when l sobered up.

24:36.601 --> 24:39.468
She was a good woman,
my Jo.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.434
Maggie's a lot like her.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.818
When we were in that bar
and afterwards,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.945
lthoughtabout
a lot of things.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.983
You become a father someday,
you'll understand.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.369
No man is good enough
for your little girl...

25:00.458 --> 25:02.494
until one is.

25:08.758 --> 25:12.717
Go on now, before I change
my mind about you.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.511
Thanks.

25:20.603 --> 25:24.221
(cows mooing )

25:26.776 --> 25:28.812
( door opens)

25:33.032 --> 25:34.533
It's almost time.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.866
I know this isn't
easy for you.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.902
It isn't easy for anyone.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.660
But I thought it through.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.326
I made the call.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.790
I'm ready to do this.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.377
You don't have to
be the one to do it--

25:51.551 --> 25:54.293
- Shane, Daryl.
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be me.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.633
I brought him back here.
Maybe I shouldn't have.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.513
I gotta keep
these people safe.

25:59.684 --> 26:01.174
That is what
I'm gonna do.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.138
What about Dale?

26:03.312 --> 26:05.519
He's got an uphill battle.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.559
- You said you support me.
- I do.

26:13.865 --> 26:16.698
But you didn't say
you think I'm making the right call.

26:24.167 --> 26:26.954
This is the right call.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.925
(growling)

27:14.884 --> 27:16.795
( screams )

27:16.969 --> 27:20.336
(whimpering)

27:50.253 --> 27:51.538
Rick:
Let's gather up.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.873
Come on, Carl.
I want you to stay with Jimmy.

27:54.048 --> 27:56.505
But I want to listen.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.883
Hm-mmm, not this time.
Come on.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.480
( door shuts)

28:21.492 --> 28:24.700
So how do we do this?
Just take a vote?

28:24.871 --> 28:28.079
- Does it have to be unanimous?
- Lori: How about majority rules?

28:28.249 --> 28:30.285
Well, let's just see where
everybody stands

28:30.459 --> 28:33.075
then we can talk
through the options.

28:33.254 --> 28:36.542
The way I see it, there's only
one way to move forward.

28:36.716 --> 28:40.379
Killing him, right?

28:40.553 --> 28:42.509
I mean, why even bother
to take a vote?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.216
It's clear which way
the wind's blowing.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.382
Well, if people believe we should
spare him, I want to know.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.427
Well, I can tell you
it's a small group--

28:50.605 --> 28:53.096
maybe just me and Glenn.

28:58.613 --> 29:02.731
Look, I think you're pretty
much right about everything,

29:02.909 --> 29:05.742
- all the time, but this--
- They've got you scared.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.324
He's not one of us.

29:08.497 --> 29:11.330
And we've-- we've lost
too many people already.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.461
How about you?
Do you agree with this?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.877
Couldn't we continue
keeping him prisoner?

29:21.052 --> 29:23.634
Just another mouth to feed.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.669
It may be a lean winter.

29:25.848 --> 29:29.136
- We could ration better.
- Well, he could be an asset.

29:29.310 --> 29:31.676
Give him a chance
to prove himself.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.470
- Put him to work?
- We're not letting him walk around.

29:34.649 --> 29:35.809
We could put
an escort on him.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.769
Who wants to volunteer
for that duty?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.059
Dale: lwill.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.147
I don't think any of us should be
walking around with this guy.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.359
He's right. I wouldn't feel safe
unless he was tied up.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.489
We can't exactly put chains around
his ankles,

29:46.661 --> 29:48.117
sentence him
to hard labor.

29:48.287 --> 29:52.155
Look, say we let him
join us, right?

29:52.333 --> 29:55.291
Maybe he's helpful,
maybe he's nice.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.622
We let our guard down
and maybe he runs off,

29:57.797 --> 29:59.958
brings back his 30 men.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.339
So the answer is to kill him

30:02.510 --> 30:06.298
to prevent a crime that
he may never even attempt?

30:06.472 --> 30:10.215
If we do this,
we're saying there's no hope.

30:10.393 --> 30:13.305
Rule of law is dead.
There is no civilization.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.390
Oh, my God.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.358
Could you drive him
further out?

30:20.277 --> 30:23.064
You barely
came back this time.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.154
There are walkers.
You could break down.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.158
- You could get lost.
- Daryl: Or get ambushed.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.035
They're right. We should not put
our own people at risk.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.447
If you go through with it,

30:34.625 --> 30:36.707
how would you do it?

30:36.877 --> 30:38.617
Would he suffer?

30:39.964 --> 30:42.330
We could hang him, right?
Just snap his neck.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.715
I thought about that.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.137
Shooting may be
more humane.

30:48.222 --> 30:50.713
And what about the body?

30:50.891 --> 30:52.677
- Do we bury him?
- Hold on, hold on.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.559
You're talking about this like
it's already decided.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.766
You've been talking all day,
going around in circles.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.555
You just wanna go around
in circles again?

30:59.734 --> 31:01.565
Dale:
This is a young man's life

31:01.736 --> 31:05.103
and it is worth more than
a five-minute conversation!

31:06.782 --> 31:08.898
Is this what it's come to?

31:09.076 --> 31:12.034
We kill someone because we can't
decide what else to do with him?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.742
You saved him
and now look at us.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.999
He's been tortured.
He's gonna be executed.

31:22.298 --> 31:25.085
How are we any better than those
people that we're so afraid of?

31:32.475 --> 31:34.056
We all know
what needs to be done.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.682
No, Dale is right.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.468
We can't leave
any stone unturned here.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.261
- We have a responsibility--
- So what's the other solution?

31:39.440 --> 31:40.429
Lori:
Let Rick finish.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.566
We haven't come up with
a single viable option yet.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.772
- | wish we could.
- So let's work on it!

31:45.946 --> 31:48.779
- Rick: We are.
- Carol: Stop it. Just stop it.

31:48.949 --> 31:52.362
I'm sick of everybody
arguing and fighting.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.242
I didn't ask for this.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.029
You can't ask us to decide
something like this.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.044
Please, decide--
either of you, both of you--

32:01.212 --> 32:03.123
but leave me out.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.912
Not speaking out

32:05.091 --> 32:07.173
or killing him yourself--

32:07.343 --> 32:09.004
there's no difference.

32:09.178 --> 32:11.294
Rick:
All right, that's enough.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.054
Anybody who wants the floor

32:14.225 --> 32:15.590
before we make
a final decision

32:15.768 --> 32:17.975
has the chance.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.700
You once said that
we don't kill the living.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.987
Well, that was before
the living tried to kill us.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.951
But don't you see?
If we do this,

32:40.126 --> 32:41.662
the people that we were--

32:41.836 --> 32:44.919
the world
that we knew is dead.

32:46.173 --> 32:50.212
And this new world is ugly.
lt's... harsh.

32:50.386 --> 32:53.048
lt's survival of the fittest.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.346
And that's a world
I don't wanna live in

32:56.517 --> 32:58.633
and I don't believe
that any of you do.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.472
I can't.

33:02.106 --> 33:03.721
Please.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.765
Let's just do what's right.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.866
Isn't there anybody else
who's gonna stand with me?

33:26.589 --> 33:28.295
He's right.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.132
We should try
to find another way.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.506
Anybody else?

33:56.952 --> 33:59.113
Are y'all gonna watch, too?

34:00.998 --> 34:02.829
No, you'll go hide
your heads in your tents

34:03.000 --> 34:05.241
and try to forget that we're
slaughtering a human being.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.914
Whoa.

34:08.923 --> 34:10.538
I won't be a party to it.

34:14.845 --> 34:16.961
This group is broken.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.637
( door opens, closes)

34:28.943 --> 34:29.898
( crickets chirping )

34:29.902 --> 34:30.982
( crickets chirping )

34:35.324 --> 34:38.191
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.661
Wait, wait.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.826
- Wait.
- Put him there.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.591
- It's all gonna be over soon.
- Hey. What?

34:56.762 --> 34:58.468
- What's gonna be over soon?
- Relax.

34:58.639 --> 35:02.302
- Hey. Hey. No, no, no, no.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

35:02.476 --> 35:06.219
- No. ( crying)
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.145
Oh, no.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.481
Would you like
to stand or kneel?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.772
Oh, no, please.

35:17.950 --> 35:20.692
Ple--
( groaning )

35:22.204 --> 35:24.240
(sobbing )

35:31.463 --> 35:33.499
Do you have
any final words?

35:33.674 --> 35:35.756
(sobbing continues)

35:37.303 --> 35:39.294
No. Please.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.008
Please, don't. Don't.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.269
- ( clicks)
- Don't.

36:06.415 --> 36:08.076
Carl:
Do it, Dad.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.206
Do it.

36:15.049 --> 36:17.506
Are you kidding me?
What did I say to you?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.177
What did I say to you?

36:24.224 --> 36:25.680
Take him away.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.391
Take him away.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.972
- Get up.
- ( whimpering)

37:13.607 --> 37:16.690
We're keeping him
in custody for now.

37:19.113 --> 37:21.104
I'm gonna find Dale.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.115
Carl, go inside.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.947
Now, please.

37:35.629 --> 37:37.836
He followed us.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.006
He wanted to watch.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.636
- I couldn't.
- That's okay.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.970
That's okay.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.089
(cow moaning)

39:01.548 --> 39:03.709
- ( growling)
- ( screaming )

39:05.385 --> 39:06.716
- Get Carl.
- Baby.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.718
- Carl: What happened?
- Come here. Come here.

39:08.889 --> 39:11.096
T-Dog, get a shotgun now!

39:11.266 --> 39:12.881
I want you to go in the house
and I want you to lock the door

39:13.060 --> 39:14.721
- and I want you to stay inside.
- Go, Carl, go.

39:16.063 --> 39:18.224
( muffled shouting )

39:18.398 --> 39:19.683
What was that?
What happened?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.064
- What happened?
- I don't know. Go!

39:21.235 --> 39:22.395
- ( growling)
- ( grunting)

39:22.569 --> 39:24.230
No!

39:32.079 --> 39:34.070
-( Dale grunting)
- Andrea: Dale!

39:44.591 --> 39:47.458
(screaming )

39:53.892 --> 39:56.508
(grunts)

39:59.898 --> 40:03.015
-( Dale coughing)
- Help! Over here!

40:03.193 --> 40:04.899
- Where? Where is he?
- Help! Run!

40:05.070 --> 40:07.777
- Hang in there, buddy.
- Who is it?

40:07.948 --> 40:09.609
- Oh, my God.
- Lori: Rick!

40:09.783 --> 40:11.444
- Lori: Rick!
- Just listen to my voice.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.451
Listen to me, all right?
Just listen to me, all right?

40:14.621 --> 40:17.988
Okay, hold on now.
Get Hershel!

40:18.166 --> 40:19.667
He needs blood.
We got to operate now.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.621
Hang on, Dale.
Hang on.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.296
(panting, moaning)

40:23.463 --> 40:26.671
Rick: Listen to me.
Come on, just listen to my voice.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.255
All right? Please.
Hershel! We need Hershel!

40:30.429 --> 40:32.795
- Look at me.
- Dale, we're gonna help.

40:32.973 --> 40:35.840
We're here. Just hold on.
Please, hold on.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.633
- Hershel: What happened?
- Rick: What can we do?

40:37.811 --> 40:39.267
Glenn:
Dale, it's gonna be okay.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.645
(panting, moaning)

40:41.815 --> 40:44.306
- Rick: Can we move him?
- He won't make the trip.

40:44.484 --> 40:45.610
You have to do
the operation here.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.438
- Glenn, get back to the house.
- Rick.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.566
No!

40:50.741 --> 40:53.574
- ( sobbing ) Oh, God.
-( Dale gurgling)

40:55.245 --> 40:57.281
Andrea:
Oh, Dale.

41:03.337 --> 41:05.999
(groaning)

41:07.841 --> 41:09.832
Andrea:
Oh, Dale.

41:15.307 --> 41:16.843
(crying)

41:24.024 --> 41:25.855
He's suffering.

41:26.026 --> 41:28.358
(gurgling)

41:29.863 --> 41:31.524
Do something!

41:35.535 --> 41:37.196
( softly )
Come on.

41:42.084 --> 41:44.040
Oh, God.

42:04.106 --> 42:05.471
(gun cocks)

42:12.447 --> 42:14.483
Sorry, brother.

42:18.078 --> 42:20.114
(gunshot)
