WEBVTT

00:19.906 --> 00:22.928
Everything starts somewhere...

00:24.286 --> 00:26.855
...although many physicists disagree.

00:28.454 --> 00:32.518
There is the constant
desire to find out where.

00:33.378 --> 00:37.212
Where is the point where it all began?

00:48.228 --> 00:51.743
But much, much later than that,

00:52.023 --> 00:55.140
the Discworld was formed.

01:05.578 --> 01:07.736
Drifting onwards through space

01:07.856 --> 01:11.710
atop four elephants on the
shell of a giant turtle,

01:12.002 --> 01:13.993
the great A'Tuin.

01:37.674 --> 01:39.853
It was some time after its creation

01:39.973 --> 01:43.644
when most people forgot that the
very oldest stories of the beginning

01:43.764 --> 01:48.313
are, sooner or later, about blood.

01:50.876 --> 01:52.649
At least, that's one theory.

01:54.126 --> 01:58.956
The philosopher Didactylos has
suggested an alternative hypothesis.

02:00.428 --> 02:03.181
"Things just happen. What the hell?"

02:08.477 --> 02:11.594
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork,

02:11.714 --> 02:16.909
the twin city of proud
Ankh and pestilent Morpork,

02:17.029 --> 02:19.623
the biggest city in Discworld,

02:19.865 --> 02:23.824
a city where magic is just another job

02:24.343 --> 02:29.213
and where the Tower of Art of
the Unseen University for Wizards

02:29.333 --> 02:33.485
looms over all the dark,
narrow streets below.

02:35.460 --> 02:40.441
Our story continues in the middle
of the night before Hogswatch,

02:40.699 --> 02:43.521
a midwinter festival,
which, for some reason,

02:43.641 --> 02:47.158
bears a remarkable
similarity to your Christmas,

02:48.101 --> 02:52.033
that now takes us to
the Tooth Fairy's castle,

02:53.022 --> 02:58.292
where magic has made children's
teeth perilously powerful,

02:58.655 --> 03:03.729
so that our story is much
sooner rather than later

03:04.459 --> 03:07.086
about blood.

03:09.374 --> 03:10.957
Mr Teatime!

03:26.576 --> 03:28.478
There you are. I've unlocked it.

03:35.718 --> 03:37.236
And Banjo's opened it.

03:52.947 --> 03:57.353
I'm not telling you anything.
Who are you, anyway?

03:58.034 --> 04:01.198
I'm glad you asked. I'm
your worst nightmare.

04:02.764 --> 04:06.452
Oh. You mean the one
with the giant cabbage

04:06.572 --> 04:08.952
and the, kind of, whirling-knife thing?

04:09.993 --> 04:11.594
Sorry, no. Not that one.

04:13.048 --> 04:15.660
I'm the one where this
man comes out of nowhere

04:15.952 --> 04:18.440
and kills you, stone dead.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.211
Oh, that one. But that's not...

04:27.273 --> 04:29.914
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.

04:32.996 --> 04:35.951
But it is nearly Hogswatch after all.

04:47.227 --> 04:48.540
Bring me the girl.

04:56.637 --> 04:57.445
Odd.

04:58.813 --> 05:01.125
Oh. It's a scythe job, then.

05:08.928 --> 05:11.758
They took the teeth. All of them.

05:12.595 --> 05:14.418
They just walked in

05:14.538 --> 05:18.912
and they... they...
No! Wait! Wait! Wait!

05:20.423 --> 05:24.131
- Where did he come from?
- A place I cannot go.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.566
Well, even if you could go there,

05:28.686 --> 05:33.280
we've got our work cut out here
keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.956
If what's happening in the Tooth
Fairy's castle isn't stopped,

05:38.076 --> 05:43.229
then, everything we've been
doing is a waste of time.

05:45.955 --> 05:48.833
And if they get to the Tooth Fairy,

05:49.307 --> 05:53.152
they will be able to
control all human belief.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.658
Unless Susan gets there first.

06:08.444 --> 06:11.862
Yes, well, it's coming along
well. Very impressive. Well done.

06:31.213 --> 06:37.126
- I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
- You... You're...

06:37.868 --> 06:41.248
Yes. The scythe, the cloak, the
white horse, the granddaughter.

06:44.808 --> 06:46.366
I need you to wake him up.

06:50.862 --> 06:52.682
His name's Bilious.

06:54.571 --> 06:57.234
He's the Oh God of Hangovers.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.593
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is

07:04.713 --> 07:07.217
but he's got to be able
to think straight first.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.443
And you brought him here?

07:17.869 --> 07:18.840
Why are you doing this?

07:18.960 --> 07:21.631
- I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know...
- Is she behind this door?

07:21.751 --> 07:23.484
I don't know. There was nearly $13

07:23.604 --> 07:25.070
- in pillow money owing, I admit.
- This her door?

07:25.190 --> 07:26.892
But I signed the form G...

07:27.012 --> 07:29.660
Will you just shut up
and answer the question?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.635
I don't know. I've
never been here before.

07:33.582 --> 07:36.100
Then your boss probably doesn't realise

07:36.730 --> 07:38.631
how irritating you are.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.532
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

07:42.901 --> 07:45.258
Or Miss Bottler gets it.

07:45.378 --> 07:49.430
It was only a bit of loose change!
And I really, I was going to...

07:50.119 --> 07:52.715
10 Scrote...

07:56.482 --> 07:57.737
Have you got the list?

07:59.989 --> 08:03.631
This is really, really stupid.

08:04.046 --> 08:06.434
I think the tradition got started

08:06.554 --> 08:09.382
when everybody had them
big chimbleys, master.

08:11.564 --> 08:14.889
Indeed. It's only a mercy it's unlit.

08:48.973 --> 08:50.936
The boy wants a pair of trousers

08:51.056 --> 08:52.972
that he doesn't have to share,

08:53.669 --> 08:55.831
a huge meat pie,

08:56.480 --> 08:58.267
a sugar mouse,

08:59.548 --> 09:01.464
a lot of toys

09:02.710 --> 09:05.474
and a puppy called Scruff.

09:06.857 --> 09:10.401
Aw, how sweet. I shall wipe away a tear.

09:11.011 --> 09:14.963
Cos what he's getting, you
see, is this little wooden toy

09:15.417 --> 09:18.600
- and an apple.
- But the letter clearly...

09:18.720 --> 09:22.380
I know. It's the socioeconomic factors.

09:23.087 --> 09:26.031
I mean, the world would be in
a hell of a mess, wouldn't it,

09:26.151 --> 09:28.144
if everybody got what they asked for?

09:28.264 --> 09:30.676
I gave them what they
wanted in the store.

09:30.796 --> 09:35.480
Yeah, well, what good is a god that gives
you everything that you want, eh?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.654
- You have me there.
- Ah, yeah.

09:37.774 --> 09:41.156
No, it's the hope that's important.

09:45.772 --> 09:46.744
Oh, yes.

09:48.548 --> 09:51.627
It's a big part of belief, is the hope.

09:52.305 --> 09:55.688
I mean, say you give people jam today

09:55.808 --> 09:57.550
and they'll just sit there and eat it, won't they.

09:57.670 --> 10:01.878
But jam tomorrow? Ah, no.
That'll keep 'em going forever.

10:01.998 --> 10:04.722
And you mean that because of this,

10:05.136 --> 10:08.557
the poor get poor things
and the rich get rich things?

10:08.949 --> 10:12.857
Well, yeah. That's the meaning
of Hogswatch, innit, master?

10:13.164 --> 10:15.764
But I'm the Hogfather!

10:18.457 --> 10:20.716
At the moment, I mean.

10:20.992 --> 10:22.470
Well, it makes no difference.

10:24.408 --> 10:27.884
I remember when I was a nipper.

10:29.318 --> 10:31.452
It was one Hogswatch, it was...

10:33.081 --> 10:35.834
...and I had my heart set on this...

10:37.460 --> 10:40.650
...huge model horse in this shop.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.298
It was what I always wanted.

10:46.142 --> 10:50.986
Someone was in there, buying it,
and, do you know, just for a second,

10:51.106 --> 10:54.224
I thought it really
was going to be for me.

10:59.734 --> 11:01.124
But it wasn't.

11:01.791 --> 11:05.171
I spent hours with me nose
pressed up against the window,

11:06.662 --> 11:09.378
till someone heard me
calling and unfroze me.

11:12.657 --> 11:17.856
Yes, I would've killed for
that horse. But you know what?

11:19.596 --> 11:23.801
I still hung up my
stocking on Hogswatch Eve.

11:24.225 --> 11:28.531
And do you know why? Cos I had hope!

11:29.376 --> 11:31.894
Yeah. And the next morning,

11:32.978 --> 11:39.736
our dad had put in my
stocking a little wooden horse

11:40.291 --> 11:43.233
that he had carved his very own self.

11:43.944 --> 11:46.025
Ah, and that was worth more

11:46.145 --> 11:49.747
than all the expensive
toy horses in the world?

11:50.746 --> 11:53.734
No, cos you're a selfish little
bugger when you're only seven.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.713
It's only grown-ups
that think like that.

11:57.962 --> 11:59.223
This is wrong.

12:00.256 --> 12:03.089
It is... unfair.

12:03.812 --> 12:06.813
Well, that's life, innit, master, eh?

12:07.794 --> 12:09.408
But I'm not.

12:11.592 --> 12:16.000
This is supposed to be
the season to be jolly.

12:17.399 --> 12:23.576
- Hmm.
- And other things ending in "olly".

12:51.870 --> 12:52.828
Please.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.578
Just take her out of vocal range.

13:01.821 --> 13:02.842
Mr Brown.

13:04.005 --> 13:05.400
Your big moment.

13:08.869 --> 13:11.428
Break me out the real Tooth Fairy.

13:20.249 --> 13:22.028
Oh, come along, lad.

13:23.024 --> 13:24.970
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes,

13:25.090 --> 13:28.226
can't you do something
more, well, magical?

13:28.346 --> 13:31.762
Well, Spold's Unstirring
Divisor would do it.

13:32.910 --> 13:38.165
You would end up with a large
beaker filled with all the nastiness.

13:38.757 --> 13:42.757
It's not difficult at all, if
you don't mind the side effects.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.267
Tell me about the side effects.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.642
The main one is
that the rest of him

13:48.762 --> 13:52.187
would end up in a
somewhat larger beaker.

13:53.957 --> 13:57.033
- Alive?
- Well, broadly, yes.

13:57.570 --> 14:02.469
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.

14:06.206 --> 14:10.480
Why don't we just mix
up absolutely everything

14:10.809 --> 14:12.057
and see what happens?

14:16.386 --> 14:18.356
It's got to be worth a try.

14:29.044 --> 14:32.723
Ah. Thank you, my dear. A-ha!

14:32.843 --> 14:35.672
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.681
Oh, you can't be too careful.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.743
- What's that? -
Ssh. Wow-Wow sauce.

15:03.253 --> 15:05.329
The hottest sauce in the universe.

15:05.702 --> 15:07.519
And it'll blow your head clean off.

15:09.022 --> 15:13.688
It's not safe to drink it if the sweat
is still condensing on the bottle.

15:19.099 --> 15:24.891
On the other hand, if it
is a kill-or-cure remedy,

15:25.011 --> 15:29.565
then, we are, given the possibility
that the patient is immortal...

15:30.935 --> 15:32.651
...probably onto a winner.

15:49.232 --> 15:51.680
I wonder if it's gone critical yet.

16:15.122 --> 16:16.189
I don't know.

16:17.416 --> 16:20.452
I wish you fellas would
show some backbone.

16:48.547 --> 16:50.733
Careful, Archchancellor!

16:51.156 --> 16:54.169
What you have there may
represent pure sobriety.

16:57.685 --> 16:58.889
I'll try it.

17:59.756 --> 18:02.426
You did say he was immortal, didn't you?

18:05.470 --> 18:09.234
- And you mean... he just appeared?
- Yes!

18:09.507 --> 18:13.176
He has no memory of existing before
appearing at the Hogfather's castle.

18:13.296 --> 18:15.659
You mean, like this fellow?

18:16.093 --> 18:20.673
Don't be ridiculous. Gods and gnomes
don't appear en masse for no reason.

18:25.992 --> 18:27.680
Bring me, let's see,

18:28.745 --> 18:32.220
20 pints of lager, some pepper
vodka and bottle of coffee liqueur.

18:34.595 --> 18:37.770
I didn't have you sobered up
just so you could go on a binge.

18:38.457 --> 18:42.265
- You don't drink.
- I don't? Oh. Yeah.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.819
- I need you to help me.
- Oh.

18:45.053 --> 18:47.328
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?

18:47.794 --> 18:51.452
I, erm, I said something
to young Stibbons

18:51.572 --> 18:54.110
about drinking and hangovers, didn't I?

18:54.230 --> 18:56.822
You mean you created it just like that?

18:56.942 --> 18:59.615
Oh, I find that very
hard to believe, Mustrum.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.450
Good job nobody mentioned
the Hair Loss Fairy, then!

19:04.764 --> 19:07.049
I am not losing my hair.

19:07.361 --> 19:09.960
It is just very finely spaced.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.546
Yes, half on your head
and half on your hairbrush.

19:15.043 --> 19:17.611
For the last time, I am not...

19:21.224 --> 19:23.310
I wish I knew where
that was coming from.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.238
We need a bigger brain for this.

19:29.683 --> 19:32.187
That thinking engine of
yours working, Ponder?

19:32.307 --> 19:34.732
Er, Hex is resting, Archchancellor.

19:37.561 --> 19:39.476
Can you hear me in there?

19:42.791 --> 19:45.473
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.

19:46.785 --> 19:51.540
What is that "ning-ning, ning-ning,
ning-ning" noise all about?

20:19.929 --> 20:21.708
It says, "Look at the Dean."

20:25.618 --> 20:27.054
"Look at the... Dean."

20:30.800 --> 20:31.793
Is there a problem?

20:40.508 --> 20:43.944
- Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
- Apparently.

20:44.207 --> 20:46.780
What have you been doing with my hair?

20:48.975 --> 20:53.442
Just a minute. Where exactly were
you before I found you in the snow?

20:53.831 --> 20:57.197
Anywhere where drink had been
consumed in beastly quantities

20:57.609 --> 20:59.476
sometime previously, you could say.

20:59.596 --> 21:00.307
A-ha...

21:00.427 --> 21:04.819
- So you were an imminent vital force, aye?
- Oh, sounds great!

21:05.969 --> 21:07.050
What is that?

21:07.764 --> 21:11.003
So, when we joked about
the Hair Loss Fairy,

21:11.123 --> 21:13.644
it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.

21:18.002 --> 21:20.641
You're calling things into being.

21:21.100 --> 21:25.161
I personally have always wondered
if there was an Eater of Socks.

21:25.472 --> 21:27.358
You know how there's always one missing?

21:38.061 --> 21:40.892
Ah! To the laundry!

21:44.866 --> 21:47.664
Tell me again who these people are.

21:48.197 --> 21:50.221
Some of the cleverest men in the world.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.923
And I'm sober, am I?

22:04.411 --> 22:06.668
What is that ridiculous
thing on your head?

22:06.788 --> 22:08.614
I don't know, sir!

22:13.773 --> 22:16.510
What? What is it? It says here...

22:17.295 --> 22:21.708
"If found, please return to
the Tooth Fairy's castle."

22:22.030 --> 22:25.500
Well, thank goodness the Tooth
Fairy already exists, hey?

22:25.785 --> 22:27.247
Tooth Fairy?

22:28.476 --> 22:31.914
Oh, you see her around a lot
these days. Or them, rather.

22:32.034 --> 22:33.655
It's a sort of franchise operation

22:33.775 --> 22:36.488
to collect children's
teeth in exchange for money.

22:36.608 --> 22:40.265
And she has a castle. She sounds great.

22:42.927 --> 22:46.625
Actually, I do remember one thing.

22:47.624 --> 22:50.106
When I appeared at
the Hogfather's house,

22:50.226 --> 22:54.278
there was this drunken
little fellow in a pointy hat.

22:54.934 --> 22:56.989
I thought it was just the drink talking,

22:57.109 --> 23:00.229
but he did mention
something about the...

23:00.349 --> 23:04.747
...permanent end of perpetual
servitude for the little helpers

23:04.867 --> 23:08.558
of all fantasy personifications!

23:09.937 --> 23:13.046
Including the Tooth Fairy.

23:16.367 --> 23:19.560
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
Where did you find this?

23:37.742 --> 23:38.795
Is he alright?

23:41.723 --> 23:42.776
I say,

23:43.910 --> 23:48.458
what is the geographical location
of the Tooth Fairy's castle?

23:48.787 --> 23:53.338
- Now I'm feeling normal, can I come with you?
- This is not a normal situation.

23:53.668 --> 23:55.470
Look, I think I'd better tell you.

23:56.260 --> 24:00.013
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:00.420 --> 24:04.893
Death. You know, death. The robes,
the scythe, the white horse, bones.

24:05.013 --> 24:08.188
Death. But at the moment,
he's acting rather strange.

24:08.308 --> 24:10.290
I just want to make sure I've got this clear.

24:10.410 --> 24:14.997
You think your grandfather is Death
and you think he's acting strange?

24:15.466 --> 24:19.424
Look, Death adopted my mother. He
then took on a human apprentice.

24:19.544 --> 24:21.834
They fell in love and I'm the result.

24:22.073 --> 24:23.426
This is fascinating.

24:23.546 --> 24:27.370
Let's just say I picked up a few strange
genetic knacks along the way.

24:37.907 --> 24:41.027
- Now, that looks dangerous.
- I hope so.

24:50.394 --> 24:55.884
- Wait! I could help you!
- Would you be any good in a fight?

24:56.828 --> 24:59.101
Yes, I could be sick on people.

25:21.717 --> 25:23.260
Shoo! Shoo!

25:34.314 --> 25:35.810
Whoa!

25:40.244 --> 25:43.418
- There he is! Watch yourselves!
- We have to sort this out.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.799
We can't have creatures
popping into existence

25:46.919 --> 25:48.852
just because people
are talking about them.

25:51.661 --> 25:53.229
Unhygienic.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.610
So, what is this implied creation, then?

26:06.660 --> 26:09.249
"Humans have always ascribed

26:09.518 --> 26:14.403
random, seasonal, natural
or inexplicable actions

26:14.523 --> 26:16.515
to human-shaped entities."

26:20.195 --> 26:25.031
"Such examples are the Hogfather,
the Tooth Fairy and Death."

26:25.743 --> 26:29.119
Well, that's all very well, but
I'm damn sure there's never been

26:29.239 --> 26:33.423
an Eater of Socks or
an Oh God of Hangovers.

26:33.543 --> 26:35.926
I think it works like this.

26:36.046 --> 26:39.043
What we're getting is the
personification of forces,

26:39.163 --> 26:42.296
- just like Hex said.
- A bit like the Hogfather?

26:43.117 --> 26:45.659
Wa..wa..wa..wa..when you're a kiddie, it's a

26:45.779 --> 26:49.579
it's as good an explanation as
any as where presents come from.

26:51.546 --> 26:53.924
But why is it happening now?

26:56.847 --> 27:00.514
"Beliefs causing new
creatures to appear."

27:01.403 --> 27:02.759
You could put it like that.

27:04.325 --> 27:07.902
"There's a finite quantity
of belief in the universe."

27:08.811 --> 27:12.259
Well, certainly people can
only believe in so many things.

27:14.103 --> 27:19.402
"It follows that if a major
focus of belief is removed,

27:20.528 --> 27:22.474
there will be spare belief."

27:22.594 --> 27:24.012
Alright, then....

27:25.097 --> 27:27.951
What are people not believing
in all of a sudden?

27:32.355 --> 27:34.630
"Out of cheese....... error."

27:34.857 --> 27:37.496
"Melon. Melon. Melon."

27:38.694 --> 27:40.794
"Redo from start."

27:43.530 --> 27:49.578
It's Hogswatch. I suppose the
Hogfather is around, isn't he?

27:52.816 --> 27:55.245
I like this job.

27:59.632 --> 28:01.461
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.300
Excuse me.

28:14.274 --> 28:17.396
Yes. This will show them.

28:25.407 --> 28:29.169
But Poor Little Match
Girl dying in the snow

28:29.289 --> 28:33.132
is all part of the spirit
of Hogswatch, master.

28:33.252 --> 28:35.925
You see, people hear
about it and they say,

28:36.045 --> 28:39.388
"We might be as poor
as a disabled banana

28:39.508 --> 28:42.580
and only can afford
to eat mud and boots,

28:42.700 --> 28:46.419
but see how much better off we are
than the Poor Little Match Girl!"

28:46.539 --> 28:50.504
That makes them happy and
grateful for what they have got.

28:51.521 --> 28:55.201
I know what the spirit
of Hogswatch is, Albert.

29:15.561 --> 29:17.915
You're not allowed to do that.

29:18.840 --> 29:23.914
The Hogfather can. The
Hogfather gives presents.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.374
There's no better
present than a future.

29:44.714 --> 29:47.731
That's it. I've had
enough of this pixie lark.

29:54.321 --> 29:56.524
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.

29:58.682 --> 30:02.182
I'm in the dark, waiting
for the Hogfather.

30:03.629 --> 30:06.790
Me. A believer in natural philosophy.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.714
I can find the square
root of 27.4 in my head.

30:16.506 --> 30:17.902
I shouldn't be doing this.

30:19.314 --> 30:21.312
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.

30:22.898 --> 30:24.211
.... be some point if...

30:57.777 --> 31:00.668
Take her somewhere warm
and give her a good dinner.

31:01.531 --> 31:05.080
And I may well be checking up later.

31:08.738 --> 31:11.680
Looks like we've been chosen
to do a bit of charity.

31:12.501 --> 31:14.890
Well, I don't call it very charitable,

31:15.010 --> 31:18.437
just dumping someone
on people like this.

31:19.092 --> 31:23.142
I dunno. Some people wouldn't
know the real meaning of Hogswatch

31:23.262 --> 31:25.622
if it jumped up and
clocked 'em in the gob.

31:46.561 --> 31:47.423
No!

32:18.084 --> 32:20.049
This is a child's painting.

32:28.630 --> 32:29.986
Twyla paints like that.

32:36.249 --> 32:37.726
I painted like that.

32:38.588 --> 32:40.678
Grandfather saved some of my draw...

32:46.850 --> 32:48.554
Come on. Let's find the house.

32:50.321 --> 32:53.044
- What house?
- There's always a house.

32:57.915 --> 33:00.871
I was told you were the
best locksmith in the city.

33:01.994 --> 33:04.214
Yes, but locks don't generally alter themselves

33:04.334 --> 33:06.550
while you're working on
them, that's what I'm saying.

33:08.816 --> 33:11.621
Are you the best or not?

33:21.862 --> 33:23.668
No! Not the dark!

33:32.989 --> 33:33.797
Banjo.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.200
I'm getting out of here.

33:37.919 --> 33:39.725
There's something wrong with this place.

33:40.001 --> 33:42.392
I made a big pile.

33:43.676 --> 33:45.291
Do you want to come with me?

33:47.066 --> 33:48.544
It's pretty here.

33:55.979 --> 33:57.252
Mr Sideney.

34:15.150 --> 34:20.270
Would he deliver to apes
earlier than to humans?

34:21.282 --> 34:23.273
Interesting point, sir.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.143
Possibly you're referring to my theory

34:26.263 --> 34:30.248
that humans may have descended
from apes. A bold hypothesis,

34:30.369 --> 34:33.924
which, if the Grants Committee
could just see their way clear

34:34.043 --> 34:38.284
to letting me hire a boat and
sail around to the islands...

34:41.844 --> 34:46.431
I just thought he might
deliver alphabetically.

35:00.697 --> 35:02.847
Let me see, now.

35:10.624 --> 35:12.535
Who the hell are you?

35:13.158 --> 35:15.630
I'm the Hogfather, of course.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.871
Erm... ho, ho, ho.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.605
You look extremely thin in the face.

35:21.753 --> 35:25.837
I... I'm, er... I'm a bit ill.

35:26.141 --> 35:26.832
Oh.

35:29.930 --> 35:32.770
- Terminally, I would say.
- Yeah.

35:33.616 --> 35:35.647
A-ha! It's a false beard.

35:35.767 --> 35:39.135
- No, it's not.
- It's got hooks for the ears.

35:40.041 --> 35:42.715
That must've given you
a spot of trouble there.

35:47.907 --> 35:49.193
A pillow!

36:08.705 --> 36:10.491
I thought there were seven locks.

36:10.778 --> 36:13.911
Yeah, but they're half magic,
half real and half not there.

36:14.368 --> 36:16.680
Then there's parts of 'em
don't exist half the time.

36:17.173 --> 36:20.149
And I thought you could open
any lock anyone ever made.

36:21.490 --> 36:25.416
Made by humans and most dwarves.
I dunno what made these.

36:25.663 --> 36:28.153
You never said anything about magic...

36:30.164 --> 36:31.600
That's a shame.

36:32.293 --> 36:35.251
Then, really, I have no
more need of your services.

36:35.505 --> 36:38.224
- You may as well go back home.
- What about my money?

36:39.168 --> 36:42.740
Of course. You should
get what you deserve.

36:46.132 --> 36:48.566
You must think I was born
yesterday, Mr Tea Cup.

36:48.937 --> 36:51.756
I'm leaving, right, with what's coming
to me and you ain't stopping me.

36:52.208 --> 36:57.069
Banjo certainly ain't. I knew
his old ma in the good old days.

36:57.402 --> 37:00.872
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?

37:01.157 --> 37:04.483
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears
off and spit 'em in your eyes.

37:04.845 --> 37:06.268
Cocky little devil.

37:12.544 --> 37:15.217
I remember you when
you was little, Banjo.

37:15.537 --> 37:18.383
- I used to sit you on my knees.
- Banjo...

37:23.475 --> 37:24.559
There you are.

37:24.796 --> 37:26.733
Where's all these shadows coming from?

37:26.853 --> 37:29.243
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault.

37:29.363 --> 37:34.706
Oh, yeah? So it wasn't you who
said, "Wow. $10,000. Count me in!"

37:34.826 --> 37:38.765
Yeah, but I didn't know there was gonna
be all this creepy stuff! I wanna go home.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.221
It's like dealing with a child!

38:01.921 --> 38:04.098
Poor guy must have slipped.

38:11.859 --> 38:13.871
Yeah. Slipped.

38:28.311 --> 38:30.613
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?

39:06.788 --> 39:10.736
- It's teeth.
- And I should be scared?

39:11.918 --> 39:13.719
There's nothing that scary about teeth.

39:15.051 --> 39:19.282
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hungover again.

39:28.143 --> 39:30.418
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth.

39:30.833 --> 39:31.515
Oi!

39:34.536 --> 39:38.217
- Surely no one would try to...
- What is that?

39:40.115 --> 39:43.164
It's such old magic, it
isn't even magic any more.

39:43.994 --> 39:48.741
If you've got a piece of someone's
hair, nail clipping or tooth,

39:49.415 --> 39:50.973
you can control them.

39:52.419 --> 39:54.200
Don't tell me someone's...

39:55.696 --> 39:58.092
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.214
And it's protecting itself.

40:14.706 --> 40:19.057
So, what happened to the other fellow?

40:19.989 --> 40:21.271
Well...

40:24.038 --> 40:26.364
...the Hogfather has enemies.

40:27.877 --> 40:29.888
What did he do, miss a chimney?

40:39.952 --> 40:43.524
There's, er, there's people
down there, Mr Teatime.

40:43.931 --> 40:46.018
Well, just do away with them.

40:46.451 --> 40:49.952
Well, er, one of them's a girl.

40:50.580 --> 40:54.069
Then, do away with them... politely.

40:55.752 --> 40:57.709
Keep going. Quicker.

41:48.278 --> 41:49.564
It's after me!

41:51.596 --> 41:52.664
Let me out!

41:53.541 --> 41:57.129
- What was that?
- It's finding their nightmares.

42:06.420 --> 42:08.565
Let me out! It's after me!

42:08.685 --> 42:10.416
Pull yourself together.

42:11.314 --> 42:14.863
Look around. There's
nothing chasing you.

42:18.815 --> 42:22.509
I thought it was the... wardrobe.

42:25.579 --> 42:26.591
What wardrobe?

42:30.184 --> 42:31.443
When I was a kid,

42:32.038 --> 42:35.612
we had this big... wardrobe.

42:35.882 --> 42:38.094
And it had this... this...

42:39.348 --> 42:41.979
On the door, it had this face!

42:42.324 --> 42:43.720
And at night, it...

42:47.980 --> 42:49.416
...whispered things.

42:54.838 --> 42:56.370
Who's that moving up there?

42:58.432 --> 43:00.375
I think they saw us. And
if they're tooth fairies,

43:00.495 --> 43:03.218
there's been a really stupid
equal-opportunities policy.

43:35.777 --> 43:38.911
Right. You go that
way, I'll go this way.

43:39.031 --> 43:42.863
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you? Hmm?

43:52.895 --> 43:55.785
This is a children's place. The
rules are what children believe.

43:55.905 --> 43:58.029
- Well, that's a relief.
- You think so?

43:58.645 --> 43:59.961
It's impossible to die here.

44:00.081 --> 44:02.339
My grandfather doesn't
figure in a child's world.

44:02.459 --> 44:05.527
That man who fell down the
stairs looked pretty dead to me.

44:05.647 --> 44:09.370
Oh, you die. But not here.
You... Let's see. Yes.

44:09.578 --> 44:11.331
You go somewhere else. Away.

44:17.715 --> 44:19.111
- Aren't you Susan?
- Yes.

44:19.231 --> 44:22.130
And when you came for Twyla's last tooth,
you were so shocked that I could see you.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.648
- Oh, yes, and I saw...
- Look, we may not have a lot of time.

44:26.046 --> 44:29.165
Is this... the Tooth Fairy?

44:29.625 --> 44:31.055
A tooth fairy.

44:34.544 --> 44:37.181
Do you... drink at all?

44:37.513 --> 44:38.717
No, I don't.

44:41.513 --> 44:44.232
Not touch alcohol at all?

44:44.880 --> 44:47.781
Never. My dad's very strict
about that sort of thing.

44:52.850 --> 44:54.081
Nice castle.

44:56.954 --> 45:00.717
Can we get on? Good. Who
brought you here, Violet?

45:00.949 --> 45:03.463
I don't know... Oh, but he's
dressed like an assassin!

45:03.583 --> 45:05.874
OK. You two stay here. I'll go find him.

45:05.994 --> 45:07.960
And I'll look after Violet.

45:23.258 --> 45:25.160
That's the fourth lock open.

45:26.446 --> 45:30.743
I commend your
expertise. And the others?

45:43.217 --> 45:48.950
Do you know exactly what's
in here, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?

45:49.946 --> 45:54.803
Logically, if you're the
guardian of children's beliefs

45:56.092 --> 45:57.939
and this is your castle

45:58.926 --> 46:02.805
and I come across as securely
locked a door as this...

46:04.407 --> 46:07.021
...then, not to thoroughly
investigate would...

46:09.782 --> 46:11.041
...lack elegance.

46:15.235 --> 46:16.712
What's that sound?

46:17.372 --> 46:19.766
- What sound?
- That sound.

46:20.228 --> 46:23.307
Like old scissors scraping.

46:26.476 --> 46:29.746
Have you ever heard of the Auditors?

46:32.293 --> 46:34.633
Well, I suppose that the
Bursar might have done.

46:35.369 --> 46:38.079
Not auditors of money.

46:38.643 --> 46:41.051
Auditors of reality.

46:41.596 --> 46:45.355
They are the civil
service of everything.

46:47.894 --> 46:49.878
And they want to get rid of us?

46:50.924 --> 46:55.631
They want humans to be... less creative.

46:56.672 --> 46:59.340
The Hogfather is a symbol of this.

47:03.583 --> 47:05.194
Strange thinking.

47:07.164 --> 47:10.918
They hate the way humans make
up stories about the universe.

47:11.211 --> 47:12.621
I can't think why.

47:14.005 --> 47:16.883
And you, why are you doing this job?

47:17.133 --> 47:18.396
Someone must.

47:19.359 --> 47:21.466
It is vitally important.

47:22.104 --> 47:26.731
Before dawn, there must be
enough belief in the Hogfather.

47:29.530 --> 47:33.154
- Why?
- So that the sun will come up.

47:35.623 --> 47:37.429
I seldom joke.

47:39.031 --> 47:41.386
What sort of godding do you do?

47:41.617 --> 47:45.989
Oh, I'm the, er, I'm
the Oh God of Hangovers.

47:46.109 --> 47:49.119
- A god of hangovers? Oh, how awful.
- I suppose so.

47:49.239 --> 47:52.100
You're more cut out to be
one of those important gods.

47:52.220 --> 47:56.178
- Oh!
- What's this, eh? Lovers' Lane?

47:56.298 --> 47:58.532
You leave him alone, you! He's a god!

48:00.589 --> 48:03.517
Dear me! Out of
thunderbolts, are we?

48:04.833 --> 48:07.378
Well, you know, I've never killed a g...

48:23.559 --> 48:25.121
What's the matter?

48:25.241 --> 48:27.240
It's just a wardrobe, innit?

48:45.487 --> 48:48.421
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see.

49:04.305 --> 49:06.166
Hex was right, Archchancellor.

49:08.017 --> 49:10.652
Hex? Who is Hex?

49:11.419 --> 49:16.564
Erm, he's the biggest
thinker in the world.

49:17.619 --> 49:21.027
I would like to meet this Mr Hex.

49:42.285 --> 49:47.359
Quite a large thaumic
reading, gentlemen.

49:48.750 --> 49:51.503
I think he got here by magic.

49:52.746 --> 49:54.904
Where did he go?

49:58.802 --> 50:02.681
They say you are the
biggest thinker in the world,

50:03.221 --> 50:05.971
but do you also believe?

50:11.969 --> 50:15.130
Extend logically the
result of the human race

50:15.250 --> 50:18.264
ceasing to believe in the Hogfather.

50:19.073 --> 50:22.907
Will the sun come up? Answer.

50:41.012 --> 50:45.579
Correct. How may this be prevented?

50:46.067 --> 50:47.066
Answer.

50:50.405 --> 50:54.759
"Regular and consistent belief."

50:58.149 --> 51:03.669
Good. I have a task for
you, thinking engine.

51:04.913 --> 51:07.279
Believe in the Hogfather.

51:11.850 --> 51:14.532
Do you believe? Answer.

51:18.990 --> 51:21.398
Do you believe?

51:22.178 --> 51:23.136
Answer!

51:40.420 --> 51:41.214
Good.

52:02.958 --> 52:03.875
Hmm.

52:08.521 --> 52:11.081
Oh, no!

52:18.997 --> 52:20.283
Let me see.

52:22.528 --> 52:24.312
How old are you?

52:26.994 --> 52:30.689
And have you been naughty or nice?

52:56.836 --> 52:57.547
Hello.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.592
Well, well, well. What have we here?

53:02.496 --> 53:07.848
Bone handle. Rather tasteless
skull-and-bone decoration.

53:08.697 --> 53:11.789
Death himself's
second-favourite weapon.

53:13.054 --> 53:14.231
Am I right?

53:16.072 --> 53:19.328
Oh, my. It must be Hogswatch.

53:20.272 --> 53:23.786
This must mean that you are Susan.

53:24.711 --> 53:26.846
The famous granddaughter.

53:27.467 --> 53:30.823
Nobility. I'd bow,

53:31.645 --> 53:36.056
but I'm afraid you'd
do something dreadful.

53:40.026 --> 53:41.777
Yes! Yes!

53:42.328 --> 53:45.379
Left-handed using a wooden
pick. It's so simple!

53:46.509 --> 53:51.447
Ah! Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh, I've managed
to open the fifth lock. No problem.

53:51.796 --> 53:55.903
They're just based on
Woddeley's Occult Sequence.

53:59.346 --> 54:02.177
- How do you know who I am?
- Easy.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.718
Twurp's Peerage.

54:05.115 --> 54:08.686
Family motto, non timetis messor.

54:09.905 --> 54:14.284
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.

54:15.877 --> 54:19.298
As for your grandfather, honestly,

54:20.334 --> 54:24.030
that motto, "fear not the reaper",

54:24.922 --> 54:26.496
is that good taste?

54:27.909 --> 54:31.462
Course, you don't need
to fear him, do you?

54:33.362 --> 54:34.525
Or do you?

54:36.885 --> 54:40.719
I don't know what you're talking
about. Who are you, anyway?

54:43.260 --> 54:46.667
I beg your pardon. My
name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.

54:47.071 --> 54:50.629
Jonathan Teh-ah-tim-eh
at your service.

54:51.797 --> 54:55.548
You mean... like around four
o'clock in the afternoon?

54:56.603 --> 54:57.300
No.

54:57.843 --> 55:02.167
I did say...
Teh-ah-tim-eh.

55:03.014 --> 55:07.041
Please don't try to break my
concentration by annoying me.

55:09.763 --> 55:12.255
- How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
- Oh! Er...

55:12.375 --> 55:14.746
It's just according to
Woddeley's Sequence,

55:14.866 --> 55:17.685
number six should be
copper and blue-green light.

55:19.888 --> 55:22.686
Do you think your grandfather
will try to rescue you?

55:23.645 --> 55:25.233
But now I have his sword.

55:25.852 --> 55:28.572
You see, I wonder...

55:31.859 --> 55:33.943
All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney.

55:34.278 --> 55:39.147
Er, I've managed to open the
sixth lock, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.

55:40.653 --> 55:44.457
Really? But it may not
be all-important now.

55:45.528 --> 55:50.284
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.

55:51.150 --> 55:54.860
- Erm...
- Yes. You may go.

55:58.575 --> 56:03.098
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery, like a petty thief?

56:04.051 --> 56:05.050
A thief?

56:05.983 --> 56:06.791
Me?

56:07.851 --> 56:10.806
I'm not a thief, madam. No.

56:14.436 --> 56:16.246
These gentlemen are thieves.

56:17.952 --> 56:19.417
That's Medium Dave.

56:20.484 --> 56:23.125
And Exhibit B is Banjo.

56:25.465 --> 56:26.464
He can talk.

56:28.539 --> 56:30.551
Oh! Who are you?

56:31.128 --> 56:32.644
I'm incognito.

56:33.475 --> 56:35.856
You look like a wizard to me.

56:46.063 --> 56:48.375
Did you suck your thumb
when you were little?

56:48.774 --> 56:49.595
Nope!

56:52.886 --> 56:56.944
- Is that the Scissor Man?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

57:00.137 --> 57:03.663
Kids believe all kinds of crap,
but I'm a grown-up now, so...

57:09.678 --> 57:14.070
No more Hogfather. And
that's only the start.

57:14.998 --> 57:18.911
I'll be able to make people
believe anything I want.

57:19.469 --> 57:20.549
What's this?

57:21.621 --> 57:24.002
You said, "No more Hogfather."

57:27.690 --> 57:30.922
He does know what we've
been doing here, doesn't he?

57:31.718 --> 57:32.963
You did tell him?

57:33.778 --> 57:37.948
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.

57:40.497 --> 57:44.330
- She did it! She killed him.
- No, I didn't. He...

57:44.525 --> 57:46.021
- Did!
- Didn't.

57:46.141 --> 57:48.789
- Did.
- What's this about the Hogfather?

57:49.077 --> 57:52.312
I don't think he's dead, but
Teatime has made him very ill.

57:52.432 --> 57:55.341
Who cares? When this is over, Banjo,

57:55.988 --> 57:59.380
you'll have as many presents
as you want. Trust me.

57:59.574 --> 58:02.591
There has to be a Hogfather,
else there's no Hogswatch.

58:02.933 --> 58:08.215
- It's just another solar festival.
- Banjo and me are going.

58:08.969 --> 58:11.788
Banjo, you're coming with me right now.

58:12.786 --> 58:15.981
Grab her, Banjo. It's all her fault.

58:20.082 --> 58:22.275
Our mam said no hitting girls.

58:22.965 --> 58:25.702
No touching them or pulling them hair.

58:26.413 --> 58:29.314
She's not a girl. She's a freak.

58:32.506 --> 58:34.442
I think I know you, Teatime.

58:34.917 --> 58:37.318
You're the mad kid they're
all scared of, right?

58:38.845 --> 58:42.870
- Banjo, I said grab her.
- Our mam said...

58:42.990 --> 58:44.443
The kid who didn't know the difference

58:44.563 --> 58:47.235
between chucking a stone at
a cat and setting it on fire.

58:47.355 --> 58:50.615
I said shut up. Get her, Banjo.

58:50.735 --> 58:54.407
The kind of little boy who
looks up dolls' dresses.

58:55.988 --> 58:58.343
- I didn't.
- Our mam said...

58:58.463 --> 59:00.929
Ah, to blazes with your mam!

59:01.383 --> 59:03.071
What did you say about our mam?

59:03.543 --> 59:05.483
I bet no one wanted to play with you.

59:05.603 --> 59:10.576
- Not the kid with no friends.
- Banjo, you do as I tell you.

59:10.920 --> 59:13.009
Our mam... Our mam...

59:13.677 --> 59:15.100
Our mam said...

59:19.804 --> 59:23.922
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?

59:27.501 --> 59:30.988
You been letting him get
into trouble again, our Davey?

59:31.275 --> 59:33.630
You have, haven't ya?

59:35.020 --> 59:37.127
No, Mam. No, Mam!

59:38.699 --> 59:41.546
You need a good hiding, Banjo.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.323
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Mam!

59:45.353 --> 59:49.052
You been playing with girls again?

59:49.172 --> 59:51.565
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, Mam!

59:51.685 --> 59:53.674
Sorry, Mam! Sorry!

59:58.590 --> 01:00:00.187
No, Mam. No, Mam!

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.298
No!...   No!

01:00:07.664 --> 01:00:10.250
Oh, no. I don't think so.

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:15.087
This place gets into
your head, doesn't it?

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:20.178
It... finds out how to deal with you.

01:00:24.805 --> 01:00:27.282
But I'm in touch with my inner child.

01:00:30.812 --> 01:00:32.235
It's so much fun.

01:00:37.397 --> 01:00:40.867
No pulling girls' hair. That's bad.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.275
I'm gonna have so much
fun with this. So light.

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:52.371
You wouldn't dare use it!
My grandfather will come after you.

01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:55.329
- He comes after everyone.
- He's very single-minded.

01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:56.772
I'll be ready for him.

01:01:10.381 --> 01:01:12.188
It doesn't work here.

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:16.225
There's no death here.

01:01:18.136 --> 01:01:20.206
Hi, inner child.

01:01:20.831 --> 01:01:22.979
I'm the inner baby-sitter.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.312
Happy Hogswatch!

01:02:06.334 --> 01:02:08.905
Is.. is.. he dead?

01:02:12.569 --> 01:02:14.287
He's not breathing.

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:16.211
Breathing spell.

01:02:16.948 --> 01:02:18.666
Breathing spell.

01:02:21.063 --> 01:02:25.684
Spolt's forthright respirator, perhaps.

01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:29.382
I think I've got it
written down somewhere.

01:02:30.085 --> 01:02:32.889
Come on, chaps. Give me some space.

01:02:39.528 --> 01:02:43.332
Excuse me... excuse me, but
this is vitally important

01:02:43.452 --> 01:02:45.599
for the advancement
of natural philosophy.

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:48.940
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.135
What is all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away.

01:02:53.655 --> 01:02:56.501
This must be the Unseen University.

01:03:00.118 --> 01:03:03.349
And you're all... wizards.

01:03:05.123 --> 01:03:06.307
There was a sword.

01:03:07.237 --> 01:03:11.146
Oh, yes. It's, er, fallen on the floor.

01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:21.729
Did I do that?

01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:26.478
I really must be off.

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:32.157
Well, he won't get far.
The main doors are locked,

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:35.155
in accordance with
Archchancellor Spold's rules.

01:03:35.628 --> 01:03:37.653
- Won't get far?
- No!

01:03:38.241 --> 01:03:42.996
While holding a sword which appears
to be able to cut through anything?

01:04:02.517 --> 01:04:05.390
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.

01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:08.407
No playing with girls.

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:18.463
What am I gonna do now?

01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:42.465
Hello, my dear.

01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:45.724
No.

01:05:47.722 --> 01:05:49.131
Sorry, dear?

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:53.944
You're not the Tooth Fairy.

01:05:56.301 --> 01:05:58.476
Oh, I am, dear.

01:05:59.138 --> 01:06:01.879
Oh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.

01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:04.557
You've even got a shawl.

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:06.591
Oh, dear.

01:06:08.977 --> 01:06:11.865
I don't understand, lovey.

01:06:13.522 --> 01:06:15.301
You forgot the rocking chair.

01:06:16.288 --> 01:06:18.710
I always thought there'd
be a rocking chair.

01:06:24.156 --> 01:06:25.716
I don't think you're real.

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:30.800
It's not a little old woman
in a shawl running this place.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.731
You're out of my head. That's
how you defend yourself.

01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:42.574
You poke around in people's heads
and find the things that work...

01:06:43.387 --> 01:06:46.730
No. It's horrible, but
it doesn't frighten me.

01:06:50.192 --> 01:06:51.396
I like spiders.

01:06:52.736 --> 01:06:54.294
Dogs? No.

01:06:57.902 --> 01:07:00.100
I like rats. Rats are fine.

01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:04.815
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?

01:07:08.363 --> 01:07:10.781
I... I...

01:07:11.005 --> 01:07:13.599
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:16.949
Not a. The!

01:07:20.556 --> 01:07:21.946
The first bogeyman.

01:07:25.103 --> 01:07:28.459
- You look terrible.
- Thank you very much.

01:07:28.579 --> 01:07:29.799
I mean ill.

01:07:31.959 --> 01:07:36.434
I used to jump out on
them and say, "Boo!" Yeah.

01:07:37.033 --> 01:07:38.927
But then I got to like 'em.

01:07:40.191 --> 01:07:43.283
Only children were frightened of me.

01:07:44.187 --> 01:07:47.033
I mean, what's to be scared of?

01:07:47.512 --> 01:07:50.864
Horns, bony arms.

01:07:52.584 --> 01:07:57.414
But then I discovered that there
were much worse things than me

01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:01.387
and I wanted to protect the children,

01:08:01.739 --> 01:08:06.665
keep them safe from all
the really bad things.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:12.202
So I built all this

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.591
to be a safe place.

01:08:16.027 --> 01:08:17.176
And the teeth?

01:08:18.022 --> 01:08:21.249
If you leave all those teeth around,

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:24.995
- anything could happen.
- Anything nearly did.

01:08:28.072 --> 01:08:31.575
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then?

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:33.801
Yes!

01:08:34.923 --> 01:08:36.975
I... ah..

01:08:37.751 --> 01:08:38.490
Oh...

01:08:39.078 --> 01:08:41.814
Then..  they came,

01:08:42.517 --> 01:08:44.077
stealing.

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:51.712
I'm too weak to look
after them any more.

01:08:56.407 --> 01:08:59.365
You don't die here.

01:09:01.201 --> 01:09:03.000
Just get old.

01:09:04.825 --> 01:09:08.054
Listening to the laughter.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:16.393
Don't worry about the teeth.

01:09:17.251 --> 01:09:19.424
I'll make them safe again.

01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:03.774
I think it would be a good idea

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.870
if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:13.245
Do... Do you think that'd be
alright? Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?

01:10:13.571 --> 01:10:18.008
You... do it until she comes back.

01:10:19.498 --> 01:10:22.056
So.... who's gonna tell me what to do?

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:26.722
No one's ever going to tell
you what to do again, Banjo.

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:33.177
Thanks, miss. I'll keep the teeth safe.

01:10:39.317 --> 01:10:42.624
- Er, miss?
- Yes, Banjo?

01:10:44.955 --> 01:10:46.556
Can I have a puppy?

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.869
I had a kitten, but our mam
drownded it cos it was dirty.

01:10:53.821 --> 01:10:56.893
I think it'll turn up quite soon, Banjo.

01:10:57.431 --> 01:10:58.403
Thanks, miss.

01:11:03.707 --> 01:11:04.477
Billy!

01:11:06.139 --> 01:11:09.304
Violet's talked about it and we thought
we ought to come back and help.

01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:12.260
- It's OK. They're all gone.
- Oh.

01:11:14.368 --> 01:11:16.667
And Banjo needed a new job.

01:11:19.592 --> 01:11:22.629
That's funny. So does Billy.

01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:26.181
Look, why don't you two
make yourselves useful

01:11:26.301 --> 01:11:28.394
and help Banjo clear up this mess?

01:11:28.873 --> 01:11:32.320
He's pretty much running the place now.

01:11:33.353 --> 01:11:36.109
- Oh, but he's...
- He's in charge.

01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:42.242
We'd love to help, Banjo. Together.

01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:48.627
Good. Have fun.
Now I'm going home.

01:11:49.994 --> 01:11:52.320
This is a hell of a
way to spend Hogswatch.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.835
Grandfather! What are you doing here?

01:12:14.177 --> 01:12:17.530
It is not over.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:21.982
You must bring the Hogfather home.

01:12:24.415 --> 01:12:27.407
These look like the mountains
where the Castle of Bones was.

01:12:27.527 --> 01:12:28.699
They are.

01:12:36.516 --> 01:12:38.856
- It's a pig!
- A boar.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:42.660
This boar is the?

01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:47.584
Yes. The Hogfather as he began.

01:12:48.282 --> 01:12:53.412
- And the dogs.
- These are not real dogs.

01:12:53.532 --> 01:12:56.810
If they catch him, he won't just die.

01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:00.351
He will... never be.

01:13:01.246 --> 01:13:02.595
Well, stop them.

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:06.464
This is a human thing.

01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:11.368
The Auditors are desperate now.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:15.305
They're determined to destroy
the Hogfather at whatever cost.

01:13:20.738 --> 01:13:23.790
You must save him.

01:14:41.045 --> 01:14:42.833
Come on. Jump.

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.780
Just you try it.

01:14:53.307 --> 01:14:56.572
Yes! Who wants some? Anyone else?

01:15:22.179 --> 01:15:24.177
Ho, ho, ho.

01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:28.938
You couldn't resist it in the end.

01:15:33.359 --> 01:15:35.152
A mistake, I fancy.

01:15:37.974 --> 01:15:41.368
It gets under your skin, life.

01:15:42.414 --> 01:15:45.087
Speaking metaphorically, of course.

01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:50.052
And, you see, the more you
struggle for every moment,

01:15:50.172 --> 01:15:52.435
the more alive you stay.

01:15:53.588 --> 01:15:57.707
Which is where I come
in, as a matter of fact.

01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:01.056
You can't do this. There are rules.

01:16:01.176 --> 01:16:04.660
Yes, there are rules.

01:16:05.077 --> 01:16:07.143
But you broke them.

01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:11.733
How dare you. How dare you!

01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:18.745
And now there remains
only one final question.

01:16:21.526 --> 01:16:26.629
Have you been naughty or nice?

01:16:30.517 --> 01:16:33.836
Ho, ho, ho.

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.702
We saved you.

01:17:25.396 --> 01:17:28.354
Dying's not how it's supposed to go!

01:19:15.355 --> 01:19:17.290
Er... Er, sorry.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.580
Hyah!

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.193
Well...

01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:47.988
...that about wraps
it up for this dress.

01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:53.826
I'd just like to ask, purely
out of academic interest,

01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:57.575
you were sure I was going
to survive, were you?

01:19:58.067 --> 01:19:59.983
I was quite confident.

01:20:02.044 --> 01:20:05.277
Good. Now, tell me...

01:20:05.397 --> 01:20:07.774
What would've happened
if you hadn't saved him?

01:20:08.198 --> 01:20:11.962
- Yes.
- The sun would not have risen.

01:20:13.232 --> 01:20:14.514
Then what would've happened?

01:20:15.092 --> 01:20:19.548
A mere ball of flaming gas
would have illuminated the world.

01:20:20.136 --> 01:20:21.587
Alright, I'm not stupid.

01:20:21.888 --> 01:20:26.281
You're saying that humans need
fantasies to make life bearable.

01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:27.332
No.

01:20:28.351 --> 01:20:32.771
Humans need fantasy to be human.

01:20:33.615 --> 01:20:38.582
To be the place where the falling
angel meets the rising ape.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:42.808
With tooth fairies, Hogfathers...

01:20:43.122 --> 01:20:43.724
Yes.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:48.966
As practice, you have to start out
learning to believe the little lies.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.553
- So we can believe the big ones?
- Yes.

01:20:52.822 --> 01:20:56.451
Justice, mercy, duty,
that sort of thing.

01:20:57.306 --> 01:21:00.275
- They're not the same at all.
- You think so?

01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:05.468
Then, take the universe and
grind it down to the finest powder

01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:08.307
and sieve it through the finest sieve,

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:14.602
and then show me one atom of
justice, one molecule of mercy.

01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:22.001
And yet, you try to act as if there
is some ideal order in the world,

01:21:22.358 --> 01:21:26.509
as if there is some... some
rightness in the universe

01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:28.788
by which it may be judged.

01:21:29.572 --> 01:21:33.636
But people have got to believe
that, or what's the point?

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:39.063
You need to believe in
things that aren't true.

01:21:39.974 --> 01:21:42.697
How else can they become?

01:22:11.584 --> 01:22:15.913
Er, would you like to
visit for Hogswatch dinner?

01:22:16.242 --> 01:22:18.226
Albert is frying a pudding.

01:22:19.158 --> 01:22:24.722
I, er... Well, they're
really expecting me here.

01:22:28.102 --> 01:22:30.511
Would you like a drink before you go?

01:22:31.058 --> 01:22:35.413
A cup of cocoa would be
appropriate in the circumstances.

01:22:40.783 --> 01:22:44.563
Right. There are biscuits in
the tin on the mantelpiece.

01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:13.360
- Susan's got a poker, you know.
- My goodness me.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.872
I thought all of you knew that by now.

01:23:16.096 --> 01:23:17.165
Indeed.

01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:19.867
Last week, she picked
a bogey up by its nose.

01:23:21.461 --> 01:23:24.919
I'll give Gawain his stocking,
then I'll come and watch.

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:26.383
Susan...

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:48.546
Well, well. Now, this is... unexpected.

01:23:50.378 --> 01:23:51.698
A family affair.

01:23:56.796 --> 01:23:57.933
I wonder...

01:23:58.918 --> 01:24:01.873
Is it possible to kill... death?

01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:04.411
Hmm!

01:24:04.876 --> 01:24:07.148
This must be a very special sword.

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:13.239
And it certainly works here.

01:24:17.147 --> 01:24:21.402
And, of course, it might well
not be regarded as murder.

01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:25.735
Possibly it is... a civic act.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.519
It would be, as they say...

01:24:32.509 --> 01:24:33.825
...the big one.

01:24:35.343 --> 01:24:38.816
You may have some personal
knowledge about your vulnerability,

01:24:40.048 --> 01:24:42.015
but I'm pretty certain

01:24:42.937 --> 01:24:46.088
that Susan here will
quite definitely die.

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:52.498
So I'd rather you didn't
try any last-minute stuff.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:58.518
I am last-minute stuff.

01:25:04.702 --> 01:25:08.073
I don't remember them asking
for anything that made a noise.

01:25:08.713 --> 01:25:13.207
Oh, there has to be something in
the stocking that makes a noise.

01:25:13.448 --> 01:25:16.896
Otherwise, what is 4:30am for?

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:19.735
There are children?

01:25:20.775 --> 01:25:24.166
Oh, yes. Of course.

01:25:25.499 --> 01:25:29.400
- Call them.
- Certainly not.

01:25:30.062 --> 01:25:33.606
It'll be instructive. Educational.

01:25:34.215 --> 01:25:36.076
And when your adversary is Death,

01:25:36.869 --> 01:25:40.039
you can't help but be the good guy.

01:25:41.549 --> 01:25:42.602
Call them.

01:25:54.526 --> 01:25:57.385
Gawain. Twyla.

01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:04.733
Come in. Come in!

01:26:05.895 --> 01:26:08.413
Curly haired tots!

01:26:11.039 --> 01:26:14.071
I caught this bogeyman.

01:26:16.986 --> 01:26:19.041
What shall we do with him, huh?

01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:21.408
It's only a skeleton!

01:26:25.934 --> 01:26:26.632
Yes.

01:26:28.085 --> 01:26:33.413
A nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.

01:26:34.604 --> 01:26:35.929
Scary, huh?

01:26:37.008 --> 01:26:38.380
He's eating a biscuit.

01:26:39.222 --> 01:26:43.389
A creepy, bony man in a black robe.

01:26:44.217 --> 01:26:46.995
You're fidgeting with that kettle,

01:26:47.401 --> 01:26:50.895
so I expect you're thinking
of doing something creative.

01:26:51.568 --> 01:26:53.972
Put it down. Please.

01:26:56.827 --> 01:26:58.685
- Slowly.
- Huh!

01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:02.397
That's not very creepy. It's just bones.

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:06.898
It's just standing there. It's
not even making "whoo-whoo" noises.

01:27:07.212 --> 01:27:11.524
And, anyway, you're
creepy. Your eye's weird.

01:27:16.019 --> 01:27:16.999
Really?

01:27:19.559 --> 01:27:23.711
Well, let's see how creepy I can be.

01:27:51.383 --> 01:27:56.252
Oh, no! Couldn't have gone through you.

01:27:57.255 --> 01:28:01.346
There's so many ribs... and things.

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:08.115
It only kills monsters.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:10.557
Stop time now.

01:28:14.338 --> 01:28:15.679
You winked at me.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:17.868
I thought you had a plan.

01:28:18.558 --> 01:28:20.088
Indeed. Oh, yes.

01:28:20.716 --> 01:28:23.767
- I planned to see what you would do.
- What?

01:28:25.655 --> 01:28:29.296
I did add the sparkly
stars and the noise, though.

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.850
I thought they would be appropriate.

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:33.571
And if I hadn't done anything?

01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:37.212
I dare say I would have
thought of something

01:28:37.883 --> 01:28:41.746
- at the last minute.
- That was the last minute.

01:28:42.698 --> 01:28:46.228
There is always time
for another last minute.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:56.820
Stop playing dead,
Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.

01:29:03.641 --> 01:29:05.584
You got it right.

01:29:06.254 --> 01:29:07.267
Of course.

01:29:13.136 --> 01:29:17.414
I'll take care of the body. That
will prevent inconvenient questions.

01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:24.125
Erm, you did know the
poker would go through me?

01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:28.013
I was quite confident.

01:29:32.424 --> 01:29:33.106
Ah.

01:29:35.576 --> 01:29:37.055
I have made this for you.

01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:41.101
Oh! Thank you.

01:29:42.947 --> 01:29:44.017
What is it?

01:29:44.983 --> 01:29:48.390
Albert said there
ought to be snow on it,

01:29:49.336 --> 01:29:51.699
but it appears to have melted.

01:29:52.883 --> 01:29:55.360
It is, of course, a Hogswatch card.

01:29:56.903 --> 01:29:57.601
Oh.

01:29:58.944 --> 01:30:01.421
There should have been
a robin on it as well,

01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:06.139
but I had considerable difficulty
in getting it to stay on.

01:30:06.441 --> 01:30:07.110
Ah.

01:30:08.254 --> 01:30:12.359
- It was not at all cooperative.
- Really?

01:30:12.805 --> 01:30:16.357
It did not seem to get into
the Hogswatch spirit at all.

01:30:18.329 --> 01:30:20.718
Oh. Thank you.

01:30:23.324 --> 01:30:26.280
- Granddad?
- Yes?

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:34.127
Why? I mean, why did you do all this?

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:40.594
Human beings make life so interesting.

01:30:42.368 --> 01:30:47.512
Do you know that in a
universe so full of wonders,

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:51.852
they have managed to invent boredom?

01:30:53.762 --> 01:30:57.388
- Quite astonishing.
- Oh.

01:30:59.365 --> 01:31:03.869
Well, then, er... Happy Hogswatch.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:07.621
Yes.

01:31:09.477 --> 01:31:10.476
Granddad.

01:31:14.289 --> 01:31:15.807
Happy Hogswatch.

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:34.952
A Happy Hogswatch

01:31:35.216 --> 01:31:38.164
and good night, children,

01:31:38.895 --> 01:31:40.988
everywhere.

01:32:24.508 --> 01:32:27.847
Ooh! Hello! Hello!

01:32:29.551 --> 01:32:33.396
Oh, you're cute. Yeah, come on.

01:32:33.997 --> 01:32:36.538
Come on, let's play. Yeah.

01:32:56.696 --> 01:33:00.188
You have a big, wooden
rocking horse in the window.

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:07.408
Er... yes. That's a special
order I made for... Lord Rodney.

01:33:07.646 --> 01:33:10.717
How much would this
lordship have paid you?

01:33:11.658 --> 01:33:14.881
- $12.
- I will give you 50.

01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:17.171
Would you like me to wrap it, sir?

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:20.940
No. I will take it as it is.

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:22.514
Thank you.

01:33:24.081 --> 01:33:28.127
Incidentally, there is
a small boy out there

01:33:28.247 --> 01:33:31.539
with his nose frozen to the window.

01:33:32.705 --> 01:33:35.832
Some warm water should do the trick.

01:33:36.244 --> 01:33:38.221
Happy Hogswatch, sir.
