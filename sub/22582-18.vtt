WEBVTT

00:03.767 --> 00:05.997
Sensors can't identify
its hull composition.

00:06.127 --> 00:08.163
There doesn't even seem
to be a warp signature.

00:08.287 --> 00:10.005
It's approaching at warp 6.

00:10.127 --> 00:11.355
How big is it?

00:11.727 --> 00:14.321
It's big, more than 500 metres across.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.320
We're in visual range.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.316
Put it up.

00:23.727 --> 00:25.240
Look familiar?

00:25.607 --> 00:27.563
It's not in the Vulcan database.

00:30.527 --> 00:31.880
Try hailing them.

00:34.727 --> 00:36.046
No response, sir.

00:36.727 --> 00:39.287
I'm not even detecting
a transceiver on board.

00:40.327 --> 00:42.045
They're gaining on us, sir.

00:50.847 --> 00:52.519
What the hell is that?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:01.367 --> 01:03.927
It's been a long road

01:05.247 --> 01:07.283
Gettin' from there to here

01:08.767 --> 01:11.565
It's been a long time

01:12.247 --> 01:15.717
But my time is finally near

01:16.207 --> 01:19.597
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:20.447 --> 01:23.280
I will touch the sky

01:23.687 --> 01:27.316
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:27.447 --> 01:30.359
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:30.487 --> 01:34.765
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:35.007 --> 01:38.079
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:38.207 --> 01:42.359
I've got faith to believe

01:42.487 --> 01:45.445
I can do anything

01:45.567 --> 01:49.401
I've got strength of the soul

01:49.887 --> 01:52.765
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:52.887 --> 01:57.085
I can reach any star

01:58.447 --> 02:00.324
I've got faith

02:02.207 --> 02:05.324
I've got faith

02:05.887 --> 02:09.118
Faith of the heart

02:21.447 --> 02:22.880
Tactical Alert.

02:23.007 --> 02:24.725
Weapons aren't charging, sir.

02:24.847 --> 02:28.760
They're off-line.
Phase-cannons, torpedoes.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.718
- Tucker to the Bridge!
- Go ahead.

02:30.847 --> 02:33.202
What's going on, Captain?
The engines just went down.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.316
Warp or impulse?

02:34.447 --> 02:35.402
Both.

02:35.527 --> 02:36.642
Hold on, Trip.

02:37.247 --> 02:39.283
- Have they dropped out of warp?
- There's no way to tell.

02:40.247 --> 02:43.523
- Our sensors can't penetrate their hull.
- What about our life support?

02:43.687 --> 02:45.086
Fully operational.

02:45.647 --> 02:48.684
That's one piece of good news.
Any bio-signs out there?

02:49.407 --> 02:50.999
None that I can detect.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.325
Rotate the dorsal camera.

03:01.407 --> 03:02.556
Hold it there.

03:03.127 --> 03:05.402
Tilt up, about 30 degrees.

03:07.007 --> 03:08.326
Get closer.

03:10.487 --> 03:14.560
The vapour doesn't contain
any elements our sensors can identify.

03:16.567 --> 03:17.841
Any atmosphere?

03:18.087 --> 03:20.521
Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon.

03:21.447 --> 03:22.800
Prep a shuttlepod.

03:24.127 --> 03:26.197
Trip, meet me and Malcolm
in Launch Bay 1.

03:26.327 --> 03:27.282
Aye, sir.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.682
You're in charge. Keep a channel open.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.080
Captain, look at this.
The atmosphere's changing.

03:58.887 --> 04:01.196
76% nitrogen, 21% oxygen.

04:01.927 --> 04:04.361
Somebody seemed to know
what we like to breathe.

04:05.007 --> 04:07.840
- What's the temperature?
- 18 degrees.

04:08.607 --> 04:10.040
Florida in November.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.085
Let's see what we can find.

04:28.527 --> 04:29.960
Look at that.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.965
I'm not reading anything.
It's like they're not there.

04:36.687 --> 04:38.405
They sure look there to me.

04:39.007 --> 04:42.761
If there aren't any life-forms here,
then who modified the atmosphere?

04:44.807 --> 04:46.525
I doubt it's a coincidence.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.086
Captain.

04:50.127 --> 04:54.564
We may not be detecting any bio-signs,
but those things sure look alive to me.

05:09.927 --> 05:11.201
Are you okay?

05:15.447 --> 05:16.562
Trip?

05:29.887 --> 05:31.639
What the hell happened?

05:31.767 --> 05:33.837
That's what I was about to ask you.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.320
I think I was up on the ceiling
with those things.

05:41.247 --> 05:44.683
I was looking down at the three of us,
but not with my eyes.

05:46.487 --> 05:47.886
I can't explain it.

05:49.927 --> 05:51.997
We should get him back to the ship.

05:52.447 --> 05:55.644
I was in Tarpon Springs, too,
swimming with Lisa.

05:56.127 --> 05:57.879
She was afraid it was getting too dark.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.884
It sounds like you were dreaming,
Commander.

06:00.007 --> 06:02.646
I know the difference between
a dream and something real.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.359
We're 150 light-years from Earth.

06:04.487 --> 06:06.318
I'm telling you, I was there.

06:08.727 --> 06:13.084
I'm not detecting any parasites
or life-forms or wisps of smoke.

06:13.447 --> 06:15.483
He seems in perfect working order.

06:16.287 --> 06:18.960
He said he had some kind of
out-of-body experience.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.477
Don't forget Florida, Captain.
I don't care how far away it is.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.406
I was there.

06:24.927 --> 06:28.363
It's a very common hallucination,
returning to a familiar place.

06:30.847 --> 06:32.200
What happened to the comm?

06:32.567 --> 06:34.285
You three talking about me?

06:36.447 --> 06:38.563
You're clear, Commander. Free to go.

06:39.247 --> 06:40.362
Thanks, Doc.

06:45.047 --> 06:47.197
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

06:48.647 --> 06:50.717
You can't believe how amazing it was.

06:52.047 --> 06:55.517
I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay
for a few days, but I can't afford to.

06:55.647 --> 06:57.603
I need you to get
those engines back online.

06:57.727 --> 06:59.001
I'll see what I can do.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.517
Let me know if you take another trip
to Tarpon Beach.

07:03.447 --> 07:06.564
Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.922
I want those weapons back online, too.

07:13.207 --> 07:14.799
I'll see what I can do.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.516
Come in.

07:26.047 --> 07:28.402
It's like we're in the belly of the beast.

07:29.087 --> 07:32.079
We have no reason to believe
their motives are hostile.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.686
They're holding my ship hostage.

07:33.807 --> 07:35.604
- We don't know that.
- We don't?

07:35.727 --> 07:38.116
Look out there. Do you see any stars?

07:38.447 --> 07:40.677
Our engines are off-line, our weapons...

07:40.807 --> 07:42.718
seems kind of hostile to me.

07:42.927 --> 07:45.361
I suppose it depends on
how you look at it.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.676
Is there something
you wanted to see me about?

07:49.807 --> 07:52.640
Ensign Sato is trying to communicate
with the life-forms.

07:52.767 --> 07:53.802
And?

07:55.167 --> 07:56.282
Nothing yet.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.763
I've spoken to a number of officers.

08:03.167 --> 08:07.046
They say the crew is concerned,
but remaining calm.

08:09.927 --> 08:11.963
I've got to get them out of here.

08:43.167 --> 08:47.365
I tried re-initialising the plasma flow,
but the power grid isn't charging.

08:48.447 --> 08:49.800
Commander?

08:52.447 --> 08:54.039
Are you all right, sir?

08:54.647 --> 08:56.239
Can I get you something?

08:57.927 --> 08:58.916
I'm fine.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.796
Good-bye, sir.

09:14.447 --> 09:16.005
Rostov to Captain Archer.

09:16.127 --> 09:17.162
Go ahead.

09:17.287 --> 09:18.606
I'm sorry to bother you...

09:18.727 --> 09:21.639
but I think there might be something
wrong with Commander Tucker.

09:22.807 --> 09:24.126
What do you mean, wrong?

09:24.247 --> 09:28.206
He was confused and seemed to think
I was his superior officer.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.562
I'll be right down.

09:29.687 --> 09:32.042
He's not here, sir. He left Engineering.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.519
Did he say where he was going?

09:35.647 --> 09:37.638
No, sir. I'm afraid not, Captain.

09:41.607 --> 09:43.245
Archer to Commander Tucker.

09:49.087 --> 09:50.236
Find him.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.002
Commander.

10:12.807 --> 10:14.525
Commander Charles Tucker III.

10:24.007 --> 10:25.156
Hungry?

10:26.247 --> 10:27.839
Yes, it's all very good.

10:34.287 --> 10:35.925
Have you ever tried this?

10:36.727 --> 10:39.878
It's called bread.
You've never eaten it before?

10:40.647 --> 10:42.683
I've never eaten anything before.

10:43.447 --> 10:44.880
Where's Commander Tucker?

10:46.487 --> 10:49.240
I'm here. Charles Tucker III.

10:51.007 --> 10:53.567
Where's the man who used to be
Charles Tucker?

10:56.407 --> 10:59.877
He's exploring another realm. My realm.

11:02.447 --> 11:03.800
But he'll be back.

11:08.047 --> 11:09.446
I want him back now.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.366
Please trust me.

11:13.207 --> 11:15.926
He's experiencing things
he never thought he could.

11:16.047 --> 11:17.162
Where is he?

11:18.287 --> 11:20.118
It's not a question of where.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.525
He's no longer corporeal.

11:23.207 --> 11:25.562
But he will be again, I assure you.

11:26.167 --> 11:29.716
When we were outside,
we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.157
Did you have anything to do with that?

11:32.287 --> 11:33.356
Wisp.

11:34.247 --> 11:35.566
Interesting word.

11:35.927 --> 11:36.882
Wisp.

11:41.247 --> 11:44.398
Yes, I suppose you could call us that.
Wisp.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.439
Where do you come from?

11:49.727 --> 11:52.764
We live in subspace.
We travel through it.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.119
We're explorers, like you.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.998
Why did you take Commander Tucker?

12:01.767 --> 12:05.157
It's been a long time since
we've encountered corporeal beings.

12:06.367 --> 12:09.404
After we performed the first crossing
with your commander...

12:09.527 --> 12:11.438
we realised we were compatible.

12:12.127 --> 12:13.719
You're very interesting.

12:14.127 --> 12:16.402
Trapped in bodies
that need maintenance.

12:17.527 --> 12:18.801
You have gender.

12:19.967 --> 12:22.197
You require mates to reproduce.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.598
You eat food.

12:29.087 --> 12:31.999
We were like you once, but we evolved.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.122
Now we can learn
how our ancestors lived.

12:39.247 --> 12:40.680
I want my crewman...

12:41.367 --> 12:43.244
and I want my ship released.

12:46.207 --> 12:47.401
Captain.

12:50.887 --> 12:52.764
Your crewman will be returned.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.162
You claim to be an explorer, Captain.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.962
Open your mind to new possibilities.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.400
What about Tucker?

13:12.527 --> 13:14.040
I've enjoyed my time with you.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.122
Sir.

13:36.927 --> 13:37.962
Wow.

13:44.567 --> 13:45.682
Wow, what?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.482
I was riding right alongside
Hopalong Cassidy...

13:49.607 --> 13:51.199
chasing some bad guys.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.165
I was with Lisa again...

13:53.287 --> 13:56.040
except this time we were
snow-sailing in New Zealand.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.522
Then I was 8 years old, maybe nine...

13:59.687 --> 14:01.564
picking up leaves with my dad.

14:03.007 --> 14:04.804
But it wasn't a dream, Captain.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.997
It was as real as I'm sitting here.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.244
They told me you can try it...

14:10.367 --> 14:11.766
anyone on the crew.

14:12.007 --> 14:13.156
Who told you?

14:14.927 --> 14:17.043
They did. The ones I was with.

14:17.367 --> 14:19.801
I thought you were
with Hopalong Cassidy...

14:20.127 --> 14:21.560
and your girlfriend.

14:22.847 --> 14:24.405
I was but...

14:26.367 --> 14:27.846
It's hard to explain.

14:29.007 --> 14:30.360
You should try it.

14:30.727 --> 14:33.002
You'll understand
what I'm talking about.

14:33.127 --> 14:34.640
You all should try it.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.006
Take him to Sickbay.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.685
Captain, I'm fine.

14:38.807 --> 14:41.321
We'll let the Doctor decide
how fine you are.

14:41.807 --> 14:42.922
Commander.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.759
Something smells funny.

14:58.007 --> 15:00.441
They've released the ship
and Commander Tucker.

15:01.127 --> 15:03.322
They've done everything you've asked.

15:03.487 --> 15:06.285
Have you considered
they may have been telling the truth...

15:06.407 --> 15:09.080
when they said
they were just curious about us?

15:11.167 --> 15:13.044
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

15:13.167 --> 15:16.000
Now that the Doctor's given Trip
a clean bill of health...

15:16.127 --> 15:19.039
my primary concern
is getting Enterprise out of here.

15:19.687 --> 15:23.566
But Trip tells me it'll be a while
before he can get the engines online.

15:25.207 --> 15:28.165
From what we can tell,
these life-forms have no mass.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.326
Noncorporeal beings.

15:32.487 --> 15:34.762
That's got to be a first for Starfleet.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.527
T'Pol thinks
they just want to get to know us.

15:39.247 --> 15:40.600
Maybe she's right.

15:41.287 --> 15:43.960
Maybe I don't trust them
because they're so different.

15:44.087 --> 15:46.203
I'd hate to think that was the case.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.205
Computer, pause. Come in.

15:50.727 --> 15:53.685
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Everything all right?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.401
I'm not certain.

15:55.887 --> 15:58.685
One of those beings appeared
in Sickbay a few minutes ago.

15:58.807 --> 16:00.923
It entered me, right here...

16:01.087 --> 16:03.317
but my physiology
must not have been compatible...

16:03.447 --> 16:05.005
it left almost immediately.

16:05.127 --> 16:07.516
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

16:07.927 --> 16:09.440
But it was disturbing.

16:09.727 --> 16:12.366
The life-form was trying
very hard to reach me.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.079
I'm going to B-Deck.

17:13.567 --> 17:14.886
B-Deck is fine.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.566
Are you a female?

17:19.247 --> 17:20.202
Sir?

17:20.327 --> 17:23.683
Your gender. You are a female, correct?

17:24.727 --> 17:26.160
Last time I checked.

17:27.327 --> 17:28.726
I'm a male.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.044
I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.

17:34.127 --> 17:38.279
There seem to be a number of
anatomical differences.

17:40.287 --> 17:41.322
Sir?

17:53.887 --> 17:55.002
Come in.

17:59.807 --> 18:00.956
Subcommander.

18:02.487 --> 18:04.603
Is there something I can do for you?

18:05.007 --> 18:06.599
You are very beautiful.

18:07.847 --> 18:11.635
Are you aware that you are the most
attractive woman on board this ship?

18:12.847 --> 18:16.123
Do you think it's appropriate for you
to be here at this hour?

18:16.247 --> 18:18.522
Would you mind taking off
your clothing?

18:19.087 --> 18:21.476
I'd like to learn more
about your anatomy.

18:24.447 --> 18:25.846
Have you been drinking?

18:25.967 --> 18:28.037
If we are to engage in mating...

18:28.167 --> 18:31.364
it would be easier if you disrobed.

18:41.927 --> 18:43.406
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

18:44.407 --> 18:45.635
Go ahead.

18:46.327 --> 18:49.205
Would you please come to my quarters
with a security team?

18:49.327 --> 18:50.442
We're on our way.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.479
Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be.

18:53.687 --> 18:55.837
I'm capable of defending myself.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.798
What is it like being a female?

19:01.527 --> 19:03.006
Is it much different?

19:05.287 --> 19:06.606
I wouldn't know.

19:06.727 --> 19:09.195
If you'd allow the crossing,
you'd find out.

19:12.047 --> 19:13.400
I don't understand.

19:14.047 --> 19:18.086
If you came to us, you could experience
what it's like to be male.

19:18.927 --> 19:20.645
Wouldn't that be helpful to you?

19:20.767 --> 19:22.200
I've never thought about it.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.396
You should.

19:23.807 --> 19:27.402
We're capable of letting you experience
anything you wish for.

19:29.887 --> 19:34.005
It would be a shame
not to take advantage of that.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.805
This isn't Lieutenant Reed.

19:38.407 --> 19:39.522
Enough!

19:42.087 --> 19:44.999
Humans don't like doing things
without their consent.

19:46.887 --> 19:49.401
When are you planning to return
Malcolm Reed?

19:50.047 --> 19:52.038
- That depends.
- Oh, does it?

19:54.407 --> 19:57.399
Let's see how much you enjoy
experiencing the human condition...

19:57.527 --> 19:59.199
Iocked in Reed's quarters.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.161
- Tucker.
- They've got Malcolm.

20:08.287 --> 20:08.927
I need the ship ready to go
on my command.

20:08.927 --> 20:10.360
I need the ship ready to go
on my command.

20:10.487 --> 20:12.398
They're going to give him back,
aren't they?

20:12.527 --> 20:13.562
We'll see.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.644
What did you do with the...

20:16.047 --> 20:18.766
A security detail locked him
in Malcolm's quarters.

20:18.887 --> 20:20.286
Get it done, Trip.

20:20.407 --> 20:22.318
Right away, sir. You heard him.

20:22.447 --> 20:25.325
Let's try to prime the deuterium pumps,
fire up the injectors.

20:25.447 --> 20:27.278
- Tucker to Ensign Cook.
- Yes, sir.

20:27.407 --> 20:29.557
I need you and two other engineers
down here.

20:29.687 --> 20:30.676
I'll see who I can find.

20:30.807 --> 20:32.126
Commander!

20:32.287 --> 20:34.084
Quickly, please! Tucker out.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.720
Something wrong?

20:43.927 --> 20:45.326
Run into a problem?

20:46.607 --> 20:49.838
Problem? No. Everything's fine.

20:51.847 --> 20:54.122
Did you have any luck
priming the pumps?

20:55.647 --> 20:59.401
I have no idea how to do that.
This engine is very complex.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.237
Stay here. I'll be right back.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.080
Tucker to the Captain.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.761
Go ahead, Trip.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.401
It's Rostov, sir.
I think you need to get Malcolm.

21:12.527 --> 21:15.644
I mean, whoever's running Security
down here, right away.

21:18.927 --> 21:21.521
Hoshi, get a security team
to Engineering.

21:21.727 --> 21:23.718
Have them put Crewman Rostov
in his quarters.

21:23.847 --> 21:24.836
Aye, sir.

21:25.447 --> 21:27.836
We've been getting reports
from all over the ship.

21:27.967 --> 21:30.322
Some of the crew are acting
very strange.

21:31.647 --> 21:34.241
Then we're going to need
more than one security team.

21:34.367 --> 21:35.800
Find out who's acting strange...

21:35.927 --> 21:37.679
and have them confined
to their quarters.

21:37.807 --> 21:40.367
How do we know the security officers
are okay?

21:41.087 --> 21:43.999
For the moment,
we're going to have to hope they are.

21:44.927 --> 21:48.636
Start working on a way to figure out
who's themselves and who's not.

21:49.887 --> 21:51.525
Maybe Phlox can help you.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.361
Commander!

22:04.087 --> 22:05.406
Run into a problem?

22:05.527 --> 22:08.485
No, sir. Just ready to calibrate
the dilithium matrix.

22:09.527 --> 22:11.802
Great. Wait till I give you the signal.

22:16.367 --> 22:19.757
We polarised the hull plating
as soon as we detected that ship.

22:20.127 --> 22:22.163
Obviously, it didn't do any good.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.356
What's keeping them
from taking all of us?

22:26.607 --> 22:27.596
Archer.

22:27.727 --> 22:29.604
You've got impulse engines back.

22:29.727 --> 22:31.877
Thanks, Trip. Hold our position.

22:32.007 --> 22:34.282
I thought you said
we needed to get out of here.

22:34.407 --> 22:37.365
They've got Malcolm,
and God knows how many others.

22:37.967 --> 22:41.357
Until we find a way to get them back,
we're not going anywhere.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.595
What's the big secret?

22:49.727 --> 22:52.287
We thought it best not to discuss this
over the comm.

22:52.407 --> 22:53.840
We don't know who's been taken.

22:53.967 --> 22:54.956
What have you got?

22:55.087 --> 22:56.315
It was simpler than I thought.

22:56.447 --> 22:59.007
Elevated acetylcholine levels
in the autonomic nerves...

22:59.127 --> 23:02.119
Doctor, whatever you've got,
we need to put it to work.

23:02.487 --> 23:04.762
The Subcommander programmed
the medical computer.

23:04.887 --> 23:07.355
It's modifying this hand-scanner
as we speak.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.603
Get to work as soon as you're ready.

23:13.687 --> 23:16.201
- Tucker to Ensign Mayweather.
- Go ahead, sir.

23:16.327 --> 23:17.806
I'm a little short-handed, Travis.

23:17.927 --> 23:21.397
Can you go to the starboard nacelle
and re-polarise the warp coils?

23:21.527 --> 23:22.562
No problem, sir.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.245
Call me when you get to the catwalk.

23:24.367 --> 23:25.482
I'm on my way.

23:34.007 --> 23:35.406
There are two here.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.926
Ensign Cole and Crewman Rossi.

24:19.007 --> 24:21.043
- Mayweather to the Bridge.
- Go ahead.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.727
One of those things followed me
up the starboard strut.

24:23.847 --> 24:26.315
When I got into the catwalk,
it didn't come through.

24:26.447 --> 24:28.642
There's something keeping it
from getting in here.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.361
- Then you better stay where you are.
- Aye, sir.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.564
Archer to Commander Tucker.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.522
Yes, Captain.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.558
Is there some shielding
in the nacelles...

24:37.687 --> 24:39.882
that might keep these aliens
from getting in?

24:40.007 --> 24:42.601
The catwalk's reinforced with
osmium alloy, but...

24:42.727 --> 24:44.319
it's hard to say if that would do it.

24:44.447 --> 24:45.482
Travis thinks it will.

24:45.607 --> 24:47.359
I need you to stop
whatever you're doing and...

24:47.487 --> 24:50.399
transfer all command functions
to the starboard catwalk.

24:50.527 --> 24:52.199
We have to get everybody in there.

24:52.327 --> 24:53.316
I'm on it.

24:54.287 --> 24:57.677
I want you and T'Pol to get the crew
up there as quickly as you can.

24:58.807 --> 24:59.762
Hoshi.

25:01.687 --> 25:04.360
It would be best if they stayed
where they were.

25:05.087 --> 25:06.202
What?

25:06.327 --> 25:08.557
We're offering them a great opportunity.

25:08.687 --> 25:12.282
They may never get another chance
to experience existence as we do.

25:13.807 --> 25:15.399
Security to the Bridge.

25:18.327 --> 25:20.761
You're taking over my crew. Why?

25:21.567 --> 25:24.479
I understand
how you may be frightened by all this...

25:24.847 --> 25:26.166
Iosing your substance...

25:26.287 --> 25:28.243
existing as perceptive energy...

25:29.487 --> 25:31.955
but you'll be grateful
once you've made the crossing...

25:32.087 --> 25:33.076
I promise you.

25:33.207 --> 25:35.437
We're kind of fond of our substance.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.642
We're not very anxious to give it up.

25:38.887 --> 25:41.401
Those who've preceded you
are safe and happy.

25:42.527 --> 25:43.755
They'll understand.

25:43.887 --> 25:46.560
Are you doing this for our benefit
or for yours?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.884
Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters.

25:57.247 --> 25:58.600
You'll understand.

26:05.407 --> 26:08.001
- How many?
- Fifty-eight, including us.

26:08.127 --> 26:10.846
- And outside?
- Twenty-four, locked in their quarters...

26:10.967 --> 26:12.195
and Dr. Phlox.

26:13.007 --> 26:15.396
- You okay, Travis?
- I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

26:15.527 --> 26:16.596
Trip?

26:16.727 --> 26:19.082
I saw him down near
the Command Compartment.

26:19.207 --> 26:20.356
Thanks.

26:21.527 --> 26:23.563
We need to learn more
about these life-forms.

26:23.687 --> 26:25.757
What we need is to get our people back.

26:25.887 --> 26:28.037
It's illogical to believe we can do that...

26:28.167 --> 26:30.965
without learning more
about the aliens' intentions.

26:31.167 --> 26:32.805
Do you have something in mind?

26:32.927 --> 26:35.282
I'd like your permission
to leave the catwalk.

26:35.407 --> 26:36.601
You wouldn't have a chance.

26:36.727 --> 26:40.003
Those things would take you before
you got back to the saucer section.

26:40.127 --> 26:41.276
Not necessarily.

26:41.407 --> 26:44.319
If a life-form attempts to exchange
its consciousness with mine...

26:44.447 --> 26:45.402
I believe I can prevent it.

26:45.527 --> 26:46.926
What makes you think that?

26:47.047 --> 26:51.086
No offence, but the Vulcan mind
is far more disciplined than yours.

26:51.847 --> 26:54.441
It can resist temptations, emotions...

26:54.687 --> 26:57.201
and I believe,
invasions by these life-forms.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.960
Even if you're right,
what would you accomplish?

27:03.087 --> 27:06.443
If an alien attempts this transfer,
there may be a brief period...

27:06.567 --> 27:08.398
when our minds are conjoined.

27:08.687 --> 27:10.962
It's possible I could ascertain
their motives.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.964
It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

27:13.087 --> 27:14.315
There's no other choice.

27:14.447 --> 27:15.562
And if you're wrong?

27:15.687 --> 27:18.406
- It's a risk I'm willing to take.
- Well, I'm not.

27:18.647 --> 27:20.285
They've already taken 24 people.

27:20.407 --> 27:22.682
I'm not going to give them another one.

27:23.807 --> 27:26.037
You've told me you trust my judgement.

27:26.447 --> 27:29.166
Trust it now,
unless you have another suggestion.

27:35.567 --> 27:36.602
Sickbay.

27:36.727 --> 27:38.365
There's been an accident.

27:38.607 --> 27:39.596
Hoshi?

27:39.727 --> 27:41.126
Hoshi Sato's been injured.

27:41.247 --> 27:43.886
I don't know how to repair
the damage to her body.

27:44.007 --> 27:45.156
What happened?

14:34:17.234 --> 27:47.727
[Skipped item nr. 425]

27:47.727 --> 27:49.206
She needs assistance.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.364
I'm armed.
If you're near the door, step away.

28:05.087 --> 28:07.521
She's on the floor. She can't move.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.123
There's nothing the matter with you.

28:51.207 --> 28:54.119
I need to find the rest of your crew.
Where are they?

29:02.247 --> 29:04.078
I'm glad I brought you along.

29:08.287 --> 29:11.165
- Dr. Phlox.
- Is everything going all right, Doc?

29:11.687 --> 29:13.484
- More or less.
- Good.

29:13.887 --> 29:16.242
T'Pol and I are going to need your help.

29:57.127 --> 29:58.446
Subcommander?

30:01.247 --> 30:02.316
T'Pol?

30:04.687 --> 30:06.086
Have you succeeded?

30:09.687 --> 30:11.200
Phlox to Captain Archer.

30:11.327 --> 30:12.442
Did you find her?

30:12.567 --> 30:15.161
I'm with her now.
She's not acting like the others.

30:15.287 --> 30:16.766
But she's certainly not herself.

30:16.887 --> 30:19.196
Doesn't sound like
that's the outcome she expected.

30:19.327 --> 30:21.158
Her neural pathways are
hyper-stimulated.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.242
Damn it!

30:23.607 --> 30:26.565
- You'd better take her to her quarters.
- Yes, Captain.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.961
Come with me.
Everything will be all right.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.324
I'm afraid I have to insist.

30:35.847 --> 30:37.166
I promise you...

30:43.047 --> 30:46.244
T'Pol! What is my name?

30:47.167 --> 30:48.361
Subcommander!

30:49.487 --> 30:51.364
- They're lying to us.
- My name?

30:51.487 --> 30:54.957
We don't have time for this, Phlox.
I have to get to the Captain.

30:57.607 --> 31:00.997
Their ship is deteriorating,
and they have no way to repair it.

31:01.287 --> 31:03.039
They can't survive in space.

31:03.167 --> 31:04.919
They are doing this to save themselves.

31:05.047 --> 31:08.562
Eighty-two of them are.
One for every crewman on Enterprise.

31:09.127 --> 31:11.038
- How many of them are there?
- Hundreds.

31:11.167 --> 31:14.477
The rest will try to find
another vessel of corporeal beings.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.357
- Where's Commander Tucker?
- I'm not sure.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.801
Please find him.

31:21.287 --> 31:23.960
If the Commander can find a way
to shield Enterprise...

31:24.087 --> 31:26.476
we can leave the catwalk
and go to warp.

31:26.727 --> 31:28.365
And lose a third of the crew?

31:28.487 --> 31:29.886
Two-thirds will survive.

31:30.007 --> 31:31.156
Unacceptable.

31:31.287 --> 31:33.721
We're going to find a way
to get them back.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.520
That may be difficult.

31:38.607 --> 31:40.086
Can they survive...

31:40.847 --> 31:43.077
in a host that's dead?

31:45.167 --> 31:48.682
It would be no different than
being exposed to space. They'd die.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.595
- Archer to Phlox.
- Yes, Captain.

32:04.327 --> 32:06.522
- Are you doing all right?
- We're okay.

32:07.047 --> 32:09.277
How long do you think
we'll be in here, Ensign?

32:09.407 --> 32:12.399
I'm sure the Captain will get us out
as soon as he can.

32:12.727 --> 32:15.002
- Has anyone seen Commander Tucker?
- No, sir.

32:15.127 --> 32:17.561
Not for a while.
I think he was down there.

32:18.247 --> 32:19.475
Thanks.

32:19.967 --> 32:23.880
We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide
within 20 seconds of respiratory failure.

32:24.007 --> 32:26.077
That'll give you time
to resuscitate them?

32:26.207 --> 32:27.686
Yes. It's enough time.

32:27.807 --> 32:30.446
Close off the ventilation
to the starboard nacelle.

32:30.567 --> 32:33.081
We wouldn't want the gas to affect you
and the others.

32:33.207 --> 32:34.242
Understood.

32:34.407 --> 32:36.921
Sorry, Captain.
I can't find Commander Tucker.

32:38.847 --> 32:41.520
Has anyone opened
either of the ventral hatches?

32:43.287 --> 32:44.925
Not since we sealed them.

32:46.447 --> 32:48.039
You must have missed him.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.441
I'll look again.

32:51.127 --> 32:52.480
Four...

32:53.527 --> 32:54.846
five...

32:57.367 --> 32:58.322
six...

33:00.327 --> 33:01.362
seven.

33:01.487 --> 33:03.523
All right. Does it have an ID tag?

33:03.807 --> 33:08.039
"Junction 4-1-Alpha
Atmospheric Recycling Manifold."

33:08.567 --> 33:09.556
Good.

33:10.207 --> 33:12.482
Do you see the releases on either side?

33:12.847 --> 33:15.281
Yes. There are four of them.

33:15.407 --> 33:18.479
Two blue, two silver.

33:18.687 --> 33:20.882
Open them. The silver ones first.

33:25.447 --> 33:27.881
- Done.
- Now pull the panel off.

33:29.687 --> 33:31.086
What should I do with it?

33:31.207 --> 33:33.675
Whatever you want.
Lay it down on the floor.

33:33.847 --> 33:34.836
Very well.

33:38.447 --> 33:40.642
Right where you said it was, Captain.

33:41.847 --> 33:43.439
Find the control panel.

33:44.407 --> 33:47.956
It's right here. It has six green lights.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.046
Each of them should have a switch
next to it.

33:52.007 --> 33:54.282
About five centimetres to the left.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.396
Now...

33:55.527 --> 33:58.280
before we can release the gas
into central ventilation...

33:58.407 --> 34:02.082
you'll have to re-route the transfer lines
to the carbon dioxide tanks.

34:02.447 --> 34:04.119
How do I go about doing that?

34:04.247 --> 34:06.522
Those six switches control the feed.

34:06.647 --> 34:09.639
You'll have to re-calibrate them
in sequence for CO2.

34:10.087 --> 34:11.759
I'll guide you through it.

34:18.047 --> 34:21.005
Commander!
I've been looking all over for you.

34:22.687 --> 34:24.279
Are you all right, sir?

34:28.527 --> 34:29.516
I'm fine.

34:29.647 --> 34:31.364
The Captain asked me to find you.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.762
He needs you
in the Command Compartment.

34:34.087 --> 34:35.565
Commander?

34:42.887 --> 34:45.355
You can't go out there, sir! It's not safe.

34:45.567 --> 34:46.966
What are you doing?

35:02.367 --> 35:04.244
I've reached the access tube, Captain.

35:04.367 --> 35:06.244
Good. Now pull off the panel.

35:11.287 --> 35:12.720
It's not coming off.

35:13.007 --> 35:16.158
It'll come off.
You just need to use a little muscle.

35:22.487 --> 35:25.160
I've used every muscle I've got.
It won't budge.

35:25.567 --> 35:27.683
Try using your foot for leverage.

35:37.807 --> 35:39.001
Good suggestion.

35:39.127 --> 35:39.927
Okay. Now the next part's
a piece of cake.

35:39.927 --> 35:41.360
Okay. Now the next part's
a piece of cake.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.318
We've got a problem, Captain.

35:43.847 --> 35:45.519
Stand by, Doc. What happened?

35:45.647 --> 35:48.081
Commander Tucker.
He just went out the forward hatch.

35:48.207 --> 35:49.162
What?

35:49.287 --> 35:52.324
I tried to stop him, sir.
He didn't look like himself.

35:52.847 --> 35:54.883
I think one of those things
got inside him.

35:55.007 --> 35:56.963
If he knows what we're doing...

35:58.167 --> 36:01.842
We're going to have to speed things up.
Trip's been taken.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.398
He left the catwalk a few minutes ago.

36:04.527 --> 36:06.995
If he tries to let his buddies out of
their quarters...

36:07.127 --> 36:08.958
we don't have any guards to stop him.

36:09.087 --> 36:10.361
Tell me what to do.

36:10.487 --> 36:12.557
You'll have to purge the osmotic filters.

36:12.687 --> 36:15.326
The valves are right behind
the control circuit.

36:15.447 --> 36:19.440
You'll have to get two fingers through
the upper holes in the support plate.

36:19.567 --> 36:21.319
Normally, that wouldn't be a problem...

36:21.447 --> 36:23.802
but wearing those gloves
could make it difficult.

36:23.927 --> 36:26.077
Back home,
I'm known for my fine motor skills.

36:26.207 --> 36:28.641
I doubt a pair of EV gloves
will deter me.

36:28.967 --> 36:31.083
There are two solenoids
behind the openings.

36:31.207 --> 36:34.404
When you tap them simultaneously,
the plate should retract.

36:37.687 --> 36:39.405
Did you say there were two?

36:40.167 --> 36:42.044
About three centimetres apart.

36:44.367 --> 36:45.356
Got it.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.799
You should be looking at
two rotary valves and a lever.

36:52.407 --> 36:53.442
I see them.

36:53.567 --> 36:55.398
Open both valves all the way...

36:55.527 --> 36:58.087
then turn the lever
to the 3 o'clock position.

36:58.367 --> 36:59.720
That should do it.

36:59.887 --> 37:03.323
The 9 o'clock position
will vent the gas when we're finished.

38:10.967 --> 38:12.195
Phlox to Captain Archer.

38:12.327 --> 38:13.396
Go ahead.

38:13.527 --> 38:15.882
Mission accomplished.
I'm monitoring Commander Tucker.

38:16.007 --> 38:17.235
Good job.

38:38.967 --> 38:40.366
It's left Commander Tucker.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.602
Vent the gas.

38:41.927 --> 38:43.201
In a moment, Captain.

38:43.327 --> 38:47.036
I need to be certain the CO2 level
is consistent throughout the ship...

38:47.167 --> 38:49.044
that all the life-forms are gone.

38:49.167 --> 38:50.805
- Ready, Travis?
- Yes, sir.

39:00.727 --> 39:01.842
It's done.

39:02.247 --> 39:03.475
Full impulse.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.486
They're in pursuit.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.806
Stand by.

39:23.967 --> 39:24.922
Now.

39:41.127 --> 39:42.480
What's going on, Doc?

39:42.607 --> 39:45.519
Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine.

39:47.087 --> 39:48.725
I was just at a barbecue.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.321
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.163
I've never seen so many ribs.

39:57.127 --> 40:00.483
Follow me, Commander.
We have a lot of doors to unlock.
