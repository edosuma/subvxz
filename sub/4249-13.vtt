12:53.397 --> 12:54.940
- WHEW.

12:55.024 --> 12:55.441
COAST IS CLEAR.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.859
- [sighs]

13:01.614 --> 13:03.741
- ALFIE, BE A RAT, WHILE I VISIT
THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM.

13:03.824 --> 13:08.496
I DON'T LIKE IT TOUCHING
THE FLOOR.

13:08.579 --> 13:12.708
- DO YOU THINK AMBER AND I
ARE COMPATIBLE?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.502
- I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S
COMPATIBLE WITH AMBER,

13:14.585 --> 13:15.711
EXCEPT AMBER.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.923
- MAYBE WE'RE JUST OPPOSITE ENDS
OF THE BATTERY.

13:19.006 --> 13:22.593
- HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION
ABOUT VISITING HIM YET?

13:22.676 --> 13:23.886
MAYBE IF YOU JUST WENT
AND SAW HIM--

13:23.969 --> 13:25.804
- I'M GOING THERE NOW.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
- WHAT?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.558
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO TELL ME?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.227
- LOOK,
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU

13:31.310 --> 13:32.436
IN CASE I CHICKENED OUT.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.938
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO A MAN IN PRISON,

13:34.021 --> 13:34.939
LET ALONE YOUR FATHER?

13:35.022 --> 13:37.483
HOW'S YOUR ROOMIE?
FOOD GOOD?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.610
WHAT'S THE GOSSIP IN THE YARD?

13:39.693 --> 13:40.903
- JEROME.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.029
- YEAH.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.697
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO COME WITH YOU?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.533
I COULD COME.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.034
YOU KNOW,
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

13:47.117 --> 13:50.955
- YEAH, BUT YOU STILL CAN'T
MENTION ANY OF THIS TO POPPY.

13:51.038 --> 13:51.997
- JEROME.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.249
- OKAY.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.875
- WE HAVE TO TALK.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.545
I WANT TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.007
- NO.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.300
- WHAT?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.095
- NO.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.765
SEE YOU IN CLASS.

14:09.848 --> 14:10.724
- DID YOU GET IT?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.726
- JUST ARRIVED THIS MORNING.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.063
"VERS DE FARINE
LE CACAO ENRICHE"

14:16.146 --> 14:17.648
- ALL THOSE WORDS SAY
CHOCOLATE-COVERED WORMS.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.108
- IT'S LIKE ESCARGOT.

14:19.191 --> 14:24.280
IF THEY CALLED THEM SNAILS,
NO ONE WOULD ORDER THEM.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.199
THERE HE IS.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.285
- OH.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.162
- SORRY.
- SORRY.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.797
- HEY...

14:41.880 --> 14:46.176
YOU AND I HAVEN'T REALLY SPOKEN
SINCE...YOU KNOW,

14:46.260 --> 14:47.636
FABIAN AND I HAD
THAT CONNECTION.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.805
- HAD A CONNECTION?

14:49.888 --> 14:53.017
BY THAT YOU MEAN
KISSING MY EX-BOYFRIEND?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.226
- I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.144
- LISTEN,
IF THIS IS YOU APOLOGIZING--

14:55.227 --> 14:58.564
- I WASN'T GOING TO APOLOGIZE.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.151
BUT I WAS GONNA SAY, I TOTALLY
DON'T STEAL BOYFRIENDS.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.778
THAT'S JUST NOT ME.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.573
SO IF YOU TWO
ARE FABINA-ING IT AGAIN,

15:07.656 --> 15:11.285
THEN I WON'T LET FABIAN
TRY AND JABIAN US ANYMORE.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.749
- WELL, FABIAN AND I
ARE SO NOT "FABINA" ANYMORE.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.710
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.672
FABIAN'S A FREE AGENT.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.721
- OH, LOOK, IT'S THE MILKMAID.

15:30.804 --> 15:34.016
- LOOK,
I WANTED TO SAY SORRY.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.643
IT WAS MAYBE IN OVERREACTION.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.685
- NO.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.437
- WOULD YOU LET ME APOLOGIZE?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.397
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THINGS
SO HARD ALL THE TIME?

15:40.481 --> 15:44.360
- AM I THE FIRST GUY
TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES?

15:44.443 --> 15:47.112
I AM, AREN'T I?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.575
- I GOT YOU SOMETHING
AS A TRUCE.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.703
IT'S JUST CHOCOLATE,
BUT IT'S FANCY CHOCOLATE.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.999
- WOW, YOU'RE ALMOST LIKE
A REAL GIRL JUST NOW.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.632
THANKS.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.886
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE BAT THING.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.638
YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA
ASK YOU ANYWAY.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.648
- SO...
DID THE FISHY TAKE THE BAIT?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.544
- JEROME.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.462
- JOHN.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.214
- NOT READY TO CALL ME DAD,
THEN?

16:54.138 --> 16:56.223
- HELLO, I'M MARA.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.599
- OH, HELLO.
I'M JOHN.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.976
LOVELY TO MEET YOU.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.061
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
JEROME'S GIRLFRIEND, ARE YOU?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.688
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
- SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.773
- OH.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.949
- SO WHY NOW?

17:14.031 --> 17:14.992
- I KNOW I'VE NOT BEEN
THE BEST OF DADS.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.618
- DARTH VADAR
HAS NOTHING ON YOU.

17:17.703 --> 17:22.458
- BUT I WANTED TO TRY
AND PUT THINGS RIGHT,

17:22.540 --> 17:26.712
THAT'S IF YOU'LL LET ME,
JEROME.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.840
- JEROME?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.179
- IT'S TOO LATE.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.847
I THOUGHT I'D BE OKAY,
BUT I'M NOT.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.057
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.851
- JEROME.
- NO, DO NOT TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.146
MY DAD LEFT YEARS AGO,

17:44.229 --> 17:45.481
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN TO LEAVE.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.648
SEE IF YOU LIKE IT.

17:49.026 --> 17:49.902
OPEN THE DOOR.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.153
- JEROME,
LET HIM SPEAK.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.239
- NO, I DO NOT CARE
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.826
- IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT THAT,

17:57.910 --> 18:02.331
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.043
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
I THINK I'VE WORKED IT OUT.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.670
WE RIG A COUNTERWEIGHTED
BOOM SYSTEM

18:08.754 --> 18:10.339
THAT LIFTS UP THE BEAM
AND SETS IT IN PLACE.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.509
SO WE SIMPLY LIFT IT,
SWING IT,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.636
AND SET IT DOWN.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.013
- HMM.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.973
- WHAT?

18:20.057 --> 18:24.436
- WHY DON'T WE JUST
LIFT THE BEAM ON ITS END

18:24.520 --> 18:26.522
AND DROP IT DOWN IN THE CHASM,
LIKE THAT?

18:33.987 --> 18:36.156
- YEAH,
THAT COULD WORK TOO.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.703
[together]
OHHH.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.372
- YEAH.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.748
- YES.

18:44.832 --> 18:49.378
- OKAY, GUYS, NOW WE NEED
TO GET IT PERFECT EVERY TIME.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.884
- COME ON.
- OHHH.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.012
- SO OUT OF TEN TRIES,
WE'VE HIT THE TARGET--

18:59.096 --> 19:00.848
- ONCE.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.059
WELL, STILL,
A 10% HIT RATE IS PRETTY...

19:04.143 --> 19:06.436
- NOT GREAT.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.437
MORE PRACTICE?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.438
- HURRY, GIRL.
HURRY.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.523
THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR CHILDREN.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.733
- NO.

19:11.817 --> 19:12.901
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.945
WE'LL SNEAK DOWN TODAY
DURING LUNCH,

19:15.028 --> 19:16.780
WHILE VERA'S ON SHOPPING RUN.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.658
- IT WILL HAVE TO BE
LATER TONIGHT.

19:19.741 --> 19:23.704
JOY ASKED ME TO--
I'VE GOT TO BE A STUDY BUDDY.

19:23.787 --> 19:27.875
- AFTER LIGHTS OUT, THEN.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.753
I...

19:33.505 --> 19:36.383
- THANK YOU FOR NOT WALKING OUT.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.389
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT BEEN
ONE SINGLE DAY IN HERE

19:42.472 --> 19:44.600
THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT YOU AND POPPY,

19:44.683 --> 19:46.602
NOT ONE.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.228
I WAS AFRAID,

19:48.312 --> 19:51.773
AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO KNOW ME.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.775
LOOK AT YOU.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.069
YOU GOT SO TALL.

19:56.153 --> 19:56.778
- IT'S MOSTLY HAIR.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.156
- AND WHAT ABOUT POPPY?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.825
IS SHE STILL SO STRONG-WILLED,
LIKE SHE USED TO BE.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.827
- A DOG WITH A FRISBEE.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.122
- [laughs]

20:07.205 --> 20:07.623
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.499
[bell rings]

20:09.583 --> 20:10.042
- TIME.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.878
OH, REALLY.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.630
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.799
- Y-YOU'LL BE BACK RIGHT SOON?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.801
- I'LL BE BACK.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.802
- YOU'LL BRING POPPY WITH YOU?

20:20.886 --> 20:21.970
- WE'LL SEE.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.263
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.182
- IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. CLARKE.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.476
- OH, AND YOU, MARA.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.645
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I THINK
YOU TWO LOOK GREAT TOGETHER.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.481
[laughter]

20:32.564 --> 20:33.899
- LISTEN, JEROME.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.651
IF YOU DO COME BACK ALONE
NEXT TIME,

20:35.734 --> 20:38.362
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.156
JEROME,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.241
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GROWING UP TO BE

20:43.325 --> 20:45.661
JUST THE MAN
I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.557
- HE'S LEFT IT UNLOCKED.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.188
- IT'S OKAY.
COME IN.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.314
- COME ON.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.036
[all grunting]

21:28.120 --> 21:29.621
- ALMOST.
YOU GOT IT.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.580
- OKAY, OHH...

21:30.664 --> 21:32.624
HOLD IT.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.333
HOLD IT.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.460
OKAY, STEADY, STEADY.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.838
OHH, ALMOST THERE.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.589
HOLD IT.

21:39.673 --> 21:44.761
READY, AND GO.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.221
all: AHH! YES.

21:46.304 --> 21:46.888
- WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.391
WE GOT IT.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.351
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.895
- OKAY,
SO WHO'S GOING IN FIRST?

21:57.816 --> 21:58.942
- WOW,
DON'T ALL JUMP AT ONCE.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.069
- OKAY, I CAN TOTALLY DO IT.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.364
[speaking simultaneously]

22:12.622 --> 22:14.416
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.500
I MEAN,
IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE.
