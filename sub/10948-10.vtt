than gold, little lady.

of knowledge.

Is priceless.

for mankind to read

05:41.630 --> 05:43.390

05:43.470 --> 05:45.720
If this place has books
from all over the world,

05:45.810 --> 05:48.720
do you think they've got
info on the Fire Nation? A map maybe?

05:48.810 --> 05:49.890

Oh, great spirit, check this out.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.500
Ta-da!

12:34.920 --> 12:36.050
It's a special knot.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.340
That counts as knowledge.

You're not very bright, are you?

Enjoy the library.

Bright enough to fool you.

So, do you like flying?

13:02.320 --> 13:05.540
Of course, I'm more comfortable
on the ground where I can see.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.250
Well, I don't see the way you do.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.380
I feel the vibrations in the ground
with my feet.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.590
But this sand is
so loose and shifty,

13:14.670 --> 13:16.710
It makes everything look fuzzy.

anything wrong with fuzzy.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.360
Ah, I've seen weirder.

Aang, did you know in a past life,
you were left-handed?

It's got a date at the top,

Sokka, where are you going?

14:06.890 --> 14:10.140
I want to know what happened
to the Fire Nation on their darkest day.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.390
This could be promising.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.400
The information on the Fire Nation
should be right up here.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.440
AANG: Firebenders.

14:20.530 --> 14:23.740
KATARA: They destroyed everything
having to do with the Fire Nation.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.740
That's so unfair!

14:25.820 --> 14:28.450
Just when I think
I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation,

14:28.540 --> 14:31.000
it turns out they beat us here
a long time ago.

14:44.890 --> 14:48.260
Um, sure. I guess I'll follow you.

15:15.670 --> 15:19.630
This room is a true marvel,
a mechanical wonder.

It's a planetarium

SOKKA: This is beautiful,
but how is it helpful?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.100
Maybe these dials
represent dates and times.

15:32.180 --> 15:35.060
Sokka, try entering that date
from that parchment you took.

You picked
the best mini-vacation for sure.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.930
KATARA: Hey, wait.
What happened to the sun?

16:11.850 --> 16:13.970
Great. You must have broken it.

16:14.350 --> 16:15.980
It's not broken.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.860
The sun is behind the moon.
It's a solar eclipse.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.280
It's literally the darkest day
in Fire Nation history.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.820
Now I get it.
Something awful happened on that day.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.700
I don't know what, but I do know why.

16:29.070 --> 16:32.830
Firebenders lose their bending
during a solar eclipse.

16:32.910 --> 16:33.950
Sorry.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
That makes sense.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.790
I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse
at the North Pole

16:37.870 --> 16:39.210
did to the waterbenders.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.330

to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.180
We'll wait for the next eclipse.

16:52.260 --> 16:55.270
Then we'll invade the Fire Nation
when they're totally helpless.

You don't understand.
If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation.

You saw what they did to your library.

Because if this calendar can tell us
about eclipses in the past,

20:12.050 --> 20:14.510
then maybe it can project
when the next one will be.

check every single date.
