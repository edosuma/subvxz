<b><i>They're coming.</i></b>

00:06.770 --> 00:09.980
<b><i>They are definitely coming!</i></b>

01:29.980 --> 01:35.030
<b>Defend x And x Attack</b>

01:37.400 --> 01:38.820
<b>September 1st.</b>

01:38.820 --> 01:41.440
<b>The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio</b>

01:41.440 --> 01:44.940
<b>had chosen to reunite in Yorknew City.</b>

01:45.240 --> 01:48.040
<b>On this morning, Gon and Killua</b>

01:48.040 --> 01:51.320
<b>were visiting the Yorknew market.</b>

01:53.460 --> 01:55.660
<b>Wow, there are so many people!</b>

01:55.660 --> 01:57.070
<b>But this market's purpose</b>

01:57.070 --> 02:00.300
<b>is to swindle people who 
have come for the auction.</b>

02:00.300 --> 02:01.140
<b>What?</b>

02:01.140 --> 02:03.290
<b>This isn't the auction venue?</b>

02:03.290 --> 02:04.790
<b>Obviously.</b>

02:04.790 --> 02:06.680
<b>Yorknew's dream auction</b>

02:07.100 --> 02:11.190
<b>is held once a year in the 
world's largest auction house.</b>

02:11.190 --> 02:14.030
<b>They say that, just during the 
ten days of official bidding,</b>

02:14.030 --> 02:16.940
<b>tens of trillions of Jenny exchange hands.</b>

02:17.230 --> 02:19.060
<b>Tens of trillions?</b>

02:19.060 --> 02:22.370
<b>Yeah, an item sold for ten thousand</b>

02:22.370 --> 02:24.570
<b>can be turned around for a 
hundred million the next day.</b>

02:24.570 --> 02:26.490
<b>You can make a fortune instantly.</b>

02:26.490 --> 02:27.870
<b>It's where dreams come true.</b>

02:27.870 --> 02:29.330
<b>Wow...</b>

02:29.330 --> 02:31.310
<b>Well, that's why a lot</b>

02:31.310 --> 02:35.420
<b>of underworld auctioning 
happens at the same time.</b>

02:35.420 --> 02:37.090
<b>That's awesome...</b>

02:37.640 --> 02:40.310
<b>Anyway, do you think Kurapika 
and Leorio will show up?</b>

02:40.310 --> 02:42.290
<b>They promised to meet us here.</b>

02:42.290 --> 02:44.040
<b>I'm sure they'll come.</b>

02:44.040 --> 02:45.080
<b>Yeah.</b>

02:45.080 --> 02:47.220
<b>They might try to contact us.</b>

02:50.040 --> 02:52.220
<b>Hey, you have to buy a phone!</b>

02:52.220 --> 02:53.670
<b>It's standard Hunter gear.</b>

02:53.670 --> 02:55.280
<b>Ah, that's true.</b>

02:55.820 --> 02:57.360
<b>Hey! Welcome!</b>

02:57.360 --> 02:58.880
<b>This one's great...</b>

02:58.880 --> 03:00.460
<b>It's the hottest current model!</b>

03:00.460 --> 03:02.420
<b>Super-thin and no bigger than a credit card.</b>

03:02.420 --> 03:05.370
<b>It has GPS, which comes in 
handy for meeting with people.</b>

03:05.610 --> 03:06.840
<b>Don't bother.</b>

03:06.840 --> 03:07.370
<b>Hmm?</b>

03:07.890 --> 03:09.630
<b>That feature doesn't work in many countries,</b>

03:09.630 --> 03:11.180
<b>and it isn't even waterproof.</b>

03:11.180 --> 03:13.630
<b>That model is for people 
who only make calls.</b>

03:13.630 --> 03:14.790
<b>Leorio!</b>

03:14.790 --> 03:15.790
<b>Yo!</b>

03:16.360 --> 03:19.100
<b>I would recommend...</b>

03:19.100 --> 03:21.800
<b>this Beetle 07.</b>

03:22.640 --> 03:24.510
<b>It's a little heavy and pricey,</b>

03:24.510 --> 03:28.420
<b>but it includes a translator for the 
two hundred languages used worldwide.</b>

03:28.420 --> 03:29.870
<b>What? Seriously?</b>

03:29.870 --> 03:30.760
<b>Go with this one.</b>

03:30.760 --> 03:31.550
<b>I'll buy one, too!</b>

03:31.550 --> 03:32.310
<b>Yeah!</b>

03:32.760 --> 03:34.160
<b>Two, please.</b>

03:34.160 --> 03:36.320
<b>Two will cost four hundred thousand.</b>

03:36.320 --> 03:37.760
<b>Four hundred thousand?</b>

03:37.760 --> 03:39.290
<b>That's expensive, pops!</b>

03:40.890 --> 03:42.820
<b>Thanks, Leorio!</b>

03:42.820 --> 03:46.640
<b>But, damn, 110,580 Jenny apiece, huh?</b>

03:46.640 --> 03:50.180
<b>It's a new model, so that's a 
fair price in this market.</b>

03:50.180 --> 03:51.610
<b>Still, talk about overkill.</b>

03:51.610 --> 03:52.790
<b>I've never seen</b>

03:52.790 --> 03:55.960
<b>a cell phone purchase greeted 
with applause before.</b>

03:58.100 --> 03:59.830
<b>But you really saved us.</b>

03:59.830 --> 04:02.610
<b>Just so you know, that was nothing.</b>

04:02.610 --> 04:06.850
<b>The serious dealing only starts 
when the seller tells you to leave.</b>

04:09.420 --> 04:12.620
<b>He's the last person you 
would find at an auction.</b>

04:12.620 --> 04:13.640
<b>No kidding.</b>

04:14.140 --> 04:16.170
<b>So how are you guys doing?</b>

04:16.170 --> 04:17.290
<b>What do you mean?</b>

04:17.290 --> 04:20.040
<b>You've trained and gotten stronger, right?</b>

04:21.700 --> 04:22.980
<b>What?!</b>

04:22.980 --> 04:26.260
<b>You returned the tag to 
Hisoka at Heavens Arena?</b>

04:26.260 --> 04:29.410
<b>And you have to be pretty good 
to make it to the 200s...</b>

04:30.370 --> 04:32.400
<b>How strong have you gotten now?</b>

04:32.400 --> 04:35.290
<b>Hey, did you learn <i>Nen</i>, Leorio?</b>

04:35.980 --> 04:38.000
<b>Yeah, you bet.</b>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.380
<b>Awesome!</b>

04:39.380 --> 04:40.470
<b>Really?</b>

04:40.470 --> 04:42.910
<b>Why would I lie to you?</b>

04:42.910 --> 04:47.330
<b>It's the ability to build up a shroud 
of aura, one's own life force...</b>

04:49.970 --> 04:51.510
<b>That's <i>Ten</i>,</b>

04:51.510 --> 04:54.520
<b>one of the four major 
principles for learning <i>Nen</i>.</b>

04:54.520 --> 04:56.980
<b>Eh? There's more to it?</b>

04:56.980 --> 04:59.490
<b>Figured as much.</b>

05:01.440 --> 05:03.780
<b><i>Greed Island</i> ? What's that?</b>

05:04.360 --> 05:05.780
<b>A legendary game.</b>

05:06.070 --> 05:08.710
<b>We're trying to get a copy at the auction.</b>

05:08.710 --> 05:10.530
<b>But why a game?</b>

05:10.920 --> 05:14.910
<b>I think this game holds a 
clue to finding my dad.</b>

05:14.910 --> 05:15.900
<b>Huh?</b>

05:15.900 --> 05:18.190
<b>The game holds a clue to finding your dad?</b>

05:18.190 --> 05:19.470
<b>What do you mean?</b>

05:19.470 --> 05:21.890
<b>Well, it's a long story.</b>

05:21.890 --> 05:24.200
<b>Anyway, the problem is the cost.</b>

05:24.200 --> 05:25.180
<b>How much are we talking?</b>

05:25.180 --> 05:27.300
<b>The lowest starting bid is</b>

05:28.500 --> 05:30.050
<b>8.9 billion Jenny.</b>

05:30.050 --> 05:31.980
<b>8.9 billion?!</b>

05:31.980 --> 05:33.310
<b>How much do you have?</b>

05:34.870 --> 05:36.920
<b>We made some bad investments,</b>

05:36.920 --> 05:38.310
<b>so we're down to 5 million.</b>

05:38.860 --> 05:40.470
<b>Listen up, kids...</b>

05:40.470 --> 05:44.430
<b>This event is held at Southern Piece, 
the world's finest auction house.</b>

05:44.430 --> 05:47.640
<b>The money you have won't 
cover the entry fee.</b>

05:47.640 --> 05:51.650
<b>But the game has a low difficulty rank
on the Hunter site's treasure list.</b>

05:51.650 --> 05:52.450
<b>Really?</b>

05:52.450 --> 05:56.260
<b>Because you only need 
money to get a copy.</b>

05:56.810 --> 05:58.330
<b>It always comes back to money.</b>

05:58.330 --> 05:59.990
<b>This world runs on money!</b>

05:59.990 --> 06:01.210
<b>Well...</b>

06:01.660 --> 06:05.670
<b>That just means that a real 
treasure can't be bought.</b>

06:06.060 --> 06:09.130
<b>If you can't obtain an item 
like this with ease,</b>

06:09.130 --> 06:12.180
<b>you can't be considered 
a pro Hunter, right?</b>

06:14.930 --> 06:16.680
<b>I don't need you to tell me that.</b>

06:17.200 --> 06:19.270
<b>But first, we need money...</b>

06:19.270 --> 06:22.240
<b>We'll need some starting funds.</b>

06:22.240 --> 06:25.180
<b>Let's find a way to make 
some money in Yorknew!</b>

06:25.180 --> 06:26.030
<b>Yeah!</b>

06:27.560 --> 06:29.090
<b><i>A simple fool.</i></b>

06:29.090 --> 06:30.950
<b><i>Leorio's probably also an Enhancer.</i></b>

06:32.040 --> 06:34.450
<b>Damn! What's wrong?!</b>

06:34.450 --> 06:37.330
<b>I created a complete 
duplicate of the program.</b>

06:37.330 --> 06:40.080
<b>Why aren't any events being triggered?</b>

06:43.170 --> 06:46.210
<b><i>Did Kil somehow trick me?</i></b>

06:46.210 --> 06:47.340
<b><i>No... No way.</i></b>

06:47.340 --> 06:49.850
<b><i>He isn't capable of creating a fake game,</i></b>

06:49.850 --> 06:52.770
<b><i>and he's not stupid enough 
to lie over a deal.</i></b>

06:52.770 --> 06:56.310
<b><i>Was he tricked when he 
obtained this card?</i></b>

06:56.810 --> 06:58.300
<b><i>I want to know the answer.</i></b>

06:58.300 --> 07:01.440
<b><i>I'll do whatever it takes to 
uncover this secret...</i></b>

07:01.440 --> 07:03.060
<b><i>No matter how much I have to pay.</i></b>

07:05.340 --> 07:07.690
<b><i>I have 12.7 billion left.</i></b>

07:08.110 --> 07:10.200
<b><i>I'll need at least twice that amount</i></b>

07:10.200 --> 07:12.510
<b><i>to guarantee a winning bid...</i></b>

07:14.020 --> 07:15.690
<b>Dad, I want to make a deal.</b>

07:15.690 --> 07:18.820
<b>I'll kill fifteen people, 
so lend me 15 billion.</b>

07:19.400 --> 07:20.370
<b>Got it.</b>

07:20.370 --> 07:21.400
<b>Bye.</b>

07:21.400 --> 07:24.780
<b>Autopilot engaged to Lingon Airport.</b>

07:25.690 --> 07:28.620
<b><i>I think I was ten...</i></b>

07:29.720 --> 07:32.390
<b><i>The last time I went outside.</i></b>

07:34.080 --> 07:35.600
<b>Huh? Swap?</b>

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
<b>What does that mean?</b>

07:38.300 --> 07:39.260
<b>"Swap."</b>

07:39.260 --> 07:41.010
<b>An auction technique.</b>

07:41.010 --> 07:42.960
<b>Slang for the exchange of goods.</b>

07:42.960 --> 07:44.600
<b>Also see "Bind."</b>

07:44.600 --> 07:46.120
<b>What's a bind?</b>

07:47.300 --> 07:48.270
<b>"Bind."</b>

07:48.270 --> 07:51.890
<b>The seller names a condition 
besides money as their price.</b>

07:51.890 --> 07:55.170
<b>The winning bid will be the 
one that comes closest</b>

07:55.170 --> 07:56.950
<b>to meeting that condition.</b>

07:56.950 --> 07:58.250
<b>Condition?</b>

07:58.250 --> 07:59.750
<b>No idea what that means.</b>

08:01.480 --> 08:02.720
<b>So that's it...</b>

08:02.720 --> 08:04.960
<b>There's another kind of auctioning...</b>

08:07.520 --> 08:09.400
<b>Tonight, at 9 PM,</b>

08:09.400 --> 08:13.090
<b>the mummy of Princess Corco 
will be auctioned off.</b>

08:13.410 --> 08:14.340
<b>Ivlenkov,</b>

08:14.340 --> 08:15.340
<b>Tocino,</b>

08:15.340 --> 08:16.350
<b>and Baise,</b>

08:16.930 --> 08:19.070
<b>you'll handle the bidding.</b>

08:19.070 --> 08:21.120
<b>Will three people be enough?</b>

08:21.120 --> 08:24.700
<b>Each group of bidders 
is limited to three people.</b>

08:24.700 --> 08:28.230
<b>You cannot bring weapons, 
recorders, or communication devices.</b>

08:28.870 --> 08:35.240
<b>All on-site security is handled by 
the Mafia that runs the auction,</b>

08:35.810 --> 08:38.940
<b>so there's rarely any trouble.</b>

08:38.940 --> 08:40.890
<b>All it takes is one wrong move</b>

08:40.890 --> 08:43.120
<b>to turn every Mafia member, 
worldwide, against you.</b>

08:43.680 --> 08:46.750
<b>This auction is built on trust.</b>

08:47.230 --> 08:51.070
<b>Which is why the Mafia don't 
use security cameras.</b>

08:51.380 --> 08:53.190
<b>The unspoken rule is that</b>

08:53.190 --> 08:56.140
<b>any grudges and the like are left outside.</b>

08:57.140 --> 08:58.140
<b>Which means</b>

08:58.140 --> 09:00.130
<b>that if anything does happen,</b>

09:00.130 --> 09:02.310
<b>their testimony will decide everything.</b>

09:02.790 --> 09:07.520
<b>Their words are treated as gospel.</b>

09:07.520 --> 09:11.660
<b>So it's imperative to make 
a good impression.</b>

09:11.660 --> 09:14.400
<b>Don't start any petty fights.</b>

09:14.870 --> 09:17.910
<b>Avoid talking to anyone 
outside this group.</b>

09:18.280 --> 09:20.280
<b>What about the rest of us?</b>

09:20.280 --> 09:21.410
<b>Basho and Linssen</b>

09:21.660 --> 09:23.910
<b>will cover the rear entrance.</b>

09:24.660 --> 09:27.920
<b>Kurapika and Melody will 
take the front entrance.</b>

09:28.540 --> 09:31.320
<b>Squala and I will guard the lady.</b>

09:31.870 --> 09:33.050
<b>And with that,</b>

09:33.900 --> 09:35.720
<b>the mission begins.</b>

09:44.180 --> 09:46.140
<b>Come on down!</b>

09:46.540 --> 09:48.600
<b>Let's have some 
conditional auctioning fun!</b>

09:48.600 --> 09:50.390
<b>Here's what's up for bid.</b>

09:50.820 --> 09:53.150
<b>A diamond worth three million.</b>

09:53.150 --> 09:56.530
<b>Comes with the appraisal of the 
store where I just bought it.</b>

09:57.090 --> 09:59.420
<b>Arm wrestling will decide the winning bid.</b>

09:59.420 --> 10:02.530
<b>The first person to beat this 
boy wins the diamond.</b>

10:02.530 --> 10:05.040
<b>You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.</b>

10:05.300 --> 10:07.040
<b>Now, let's start</b>

10:07.040 --> 10:08.480
<b>the auction!</b>

10:08.480 --> 10:09.780
<b>Yeah! It's mine!</b>

10:09.780 --> 10:10.610
<b>I'm in!</b>

10:10.610 --> 10:11.960
<b>Count me in!</b>

10:11.960 --> 10:13.460
<b>Okay, don't push...</b>

10:13.460 --> 10:14.980
<b>Form a line.</b>

10:16.180 --> 10:19.160
<b><i>Adjust your strength to 
match the opponent.</i></b>

10:19.160 --> 10:21.430
<b><i>Every now and then, 
pretend to be struggling.</i></b>

10:22.790 --> 10:24.360
<b>Okay, you're first!</b>

10:25.190 --> 10:27.600
<b>You need to pay the entry fee up front.</b>

10:27.600 --> 10:29.350
<b>Here you go... 10,000 Jenny.</b>

10:29.350 --> 10:31.440
<b>Thank you, step right up!</b>

10:33.440 --> 10:35.780
<b>Okay, clasp hands.</b>

10:38.100 --> 10:40.160
<b><i>Just follow my instructions.</i></b>

10:41.630 --> 10:42.920
<b>Are you ready?</b>

10:42.920 --> 10:44.580
<b>You get a single round!</b>

10:44.580 --> 10:46.080
<b>Ready...</b>

10:46.080 --> 10:47.040
<b>Go!</b>

10:56.520 --> 10:57.690
<b>Uh-oh!</b>

10:57.690 --> 10:59.470
<b>Will he do it?</b>

10:59.470 --> 11:01.030
<b>You almost have it...</b>

11:01.030 --> 11:02.540
<b>Hang in there!</b>

11:19.440 --> 11:21.770
<b>Oh, so close!</b>

11:21.770 --> 11:24.160
<b>Damn, I lost to a little kid...</b>

11:24.690 --> 11:26.660
<b>Next, please.</b>

11:27.480 --> 11:29.590
<b>Ready... Go!</b>

11:32.570 --> 11:33.670
<b><i>I get it.</i></b>

11:35.240 --> 11:37.240
<b><i>So this is how conditional 
auctioning works.</i></b>

11:37.850 --> 11:40.920
<b><i>But to reach 8.9 billion,</i></b>

11:40.920 --> 11:44.700
<b><i>we're going to need 889,999 wins.</i></b>

11:44.700 --> 11:46.460
<b>Damn...</b>

11:46.460 --> 11:47.920
<b>And you lose!</b>

11:47.920 --> 11:49.430
<b>Next, please.</b>

11:51.230 --> 11:52.580
<b>You lose!</b>

11:54.720 --> 11:57.030
<b>He's beaten a hundred and fifty people!</b>

11:57.030 --> 11:59.220
<b>He's gotta be running out of steam.</b>

11:59.220 --> 12:01.780
<b>He looks tired, 
and he's sweating hard.</b>

12:01.780 --> 12:03.820
<b>Don't lose before I get my turn!</b>

12:05.310 --> 12:08.250
<b><i>I feel bad about tricking everyone.</i></b>

12:08.250 --> 12:10.710
<b><i>I'm even breaking out in a cold sweat</i></b>

12:10.710 --> 12:13.330
<b><i>at the idea of making so 
much money so easily.</i></b>

12:13.870 --> 12:15.900
<b>Okay, next person, please.</b>

12:18.670 --> 12:21.990
<b>Well, we have our first 
female challenger!</b>

12:21.990 --> 12:23.840
<b>All right! Get him, girl!</b>

12:23.840 --> 12:27.420
<b>Go easy on her, muscle boy!</b>

12:27.420 --> 12:28.590
<b>How old are you?</b>

12:28.590 --> 12:29.350
<b>Where are you from?</b>

12:29.840 --> 12:31.350
<b>Huh? You're no fun.</b>

12:31.930 --> 12:33.460
<b>Let's have a fair contest.</b>

12:33.460 --> 12:35.310
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

12:41.570 --> 12:43.900
<b>Ready... Go!</b>

13:13.270 --> 13:16.580
<b>Oh, too bad! You lose!</b>

13:16.580 --> 13:17.980
<b>Good job, girl!</b>

13:17.980 --> 13:19.520
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

13:19.520 --> 13:21.470
<b>Oh, you're welcome.</b>

13:22.980 --> 13:23.990
<b>A pity.</b>

13:26.040 --> 13:28.210
<b>That was your full strength, wasn't it?</b>

13:28.210 --> 13:28.910
<b>Yeah...</b>

13:29.950 --> 13:32.210
<b>I wonder who she is...</b>

13:32.640 --> 13:34.990
<b>The world champion arm wrestler?</b>

13:36.690 --> 13:37.670
<b>Well?</b>

13:38.020 --> 13:39.150
<b>I lost.</b>

13:39.150 --> 13:40.610
<b>He's strong.</b>

13:40.610 --> 13:42.450
<b>That little boy?</b>

13:42.450 --> 13:45.170
<b>I sort of wanted that diamond.</b>

13:45.170 --> 13:47.430
<b>You should've used your left hand.</b>

13:47.430 --> 13:50.180
<b>Yes, why didn't you use 
your stronger hand?</b>

13:50.180 --> 13:51.840
<b>Oh, right...</b>

13:51.840 --> 13:54.460
<b>He extended his right hand, 
so I did the same.</b>

13:54.460 --> 13:56.190
<b>I'd like to challenge him again.</b>

13:56.470 --> 13:57.370
<b>You can't.</b>

13:57.370 --> 13:59.380
<b>No time. We have our job.</b>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.780
<b>Yes.</b>

14:00.780 --> 14:03.440
<b>Besides, buying and 
bidding would be wrong.</b>

14:03.930 --> 14:05.690
<b>We're thieves.</b>

14:06.020 --> 14:08.450
<b>If we want something, we take it.</b>

14:09.180 --> 14:12.780
<b>No way! I'm going!</b>

14:14.200 --> 14:16.690
<b>Can you hear me? 
I'm ready to give up...</b>

15:29.440 --> 15:32.160
<b>Yes, her tantrum—</b>

15:32.670 --> 15:34.900
<b>That is, her crying exhausted her, 
and she's asleep now.</b>

15:34.900 --> 15:37.460
<b>I don't know what will 
happen when she wakes.</b>

15:37.910 --> 15:42.160
<b>I vow to obtain the items she desires,</b>

15:42.690 --> 15:47.920
<b>but her goal is to participate 
in the bidding personally.</b>

15:47.920 --> 15:49.650
<b>So she'll be disappointed</b>

15:49.650 --> 15:53.930
<b>when she wakes up and realizes 
that she missed her chance.</b>

15:54.470 --> 15:55.740
<b>Very well.</b>

15:55.740 --> 15:58.060
<b>I'll adjust my schedule and 
head over personally.</b>

15:58.670 --> 16:02.540
<b>For now, just be sure to get 
that mummy princess,</b>

16:02.540 --> 16:04.440
<b>so we can get Neon in a good mood again.</b>

16:05.170 --> 16:06.490
<b>Understood.</b>

16:11.220 --> 16:13.200
<b>It's me. How's it going?</b>

16:14.200 --> 16:15.450
<b>Nothing unusual.</b>

16:16.180 --> 16:18.110
<b>No changes visible from the outside.</b>

16:19.100 --> 16:20.100
<b>Understood.</b>

16:20.100 --> 16:21.770
<b>We'll notify you if anything happens.</b>

16:23.270 --> 16:25.910
<b>Still, they're being quite thorough.</b>

16:25.910 --> 16:28.400
<b>Only Mafia security are allowed</b>

16:28.400 --> 16:32.420
<b>within five hundred meters 
of the auction house.</b>

16:32.920 --> 16:37.600
<b>If they didn't do that, the surroundings 
would be crawling with thugs.</b>

16:38.040 --> 16:42.390
<b>They're practically announcing that 
unwholesome practices are going on.</b>

16:42.800 --> 16:43.980
<b>I suppose so.</b>

16:46.010 --> 16:48.850
<b><i>Will the Phantom Troupe</i></b>

16:48.850 --> 16:50.740
<b><i>really show up?</i></b>

16:56.340 --> 16:57.490
<b>Hmm?</b>

16:59.400 --> 17:01.740
<b>That's the same sound I heard earlier.</b>

17:03.330 --> 17:05.120
<b>You see,</b>

17:05.120 --> 17:08.500
<b>I happened to see you 
leaving the Hunter agency.</b>

17:13.900 --> 17:16.010
<b>When you walked past me,</b>

17:16.010 --> 17:18.820
<b>your heart was playing a melody of rage.</b>

17:20.230 --> 17:22.080
<b>May I ask you a question?</b>

17:22.080 --> 17:23.010
<b>Yes.</b>

17:23.960 --> 17:24.940
<b>Scarlet eyes.</b>

17:26.580 --> 17:27.980
<b>Exactly what...</b>

17:28.620 --> 17:30.520
<b>do they mean to you?</b>

17:34.440 --> 17:36.280
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

17:36.970 --> 17:39.100
<b>No real reason.</b>

17:39.820 --> 17:41.020
<b>Curiosity?</b>

17:41.910 --> 17:45.540
<b>When you saw the image 
on the data card,</b>

17:46.080 --> 17:48.470
<b>your heartbeat was even more fearsome.</b>

17:49.970 --> 17:53.330
<b>It played a melody of boundless fury.</b>

17:57.600 --> 18:00.250
<b>I suppose that I can't lie...</b>

18:01.680 --> 18:03.660
<b>I am a Kurta.</b>

18:04.900 --> 18:08.090
<b>Our eyes are normally brown,</b>

18:08.090 --> 18:10.330
<b>but they're red when we're excited.</b>

18:10.330 --> 18:14.310
<b>So I wear black contacts 
to avoid discovery.</b>

18:15.120 --> 18:16.220
<b>I am searching</b>

18:16.220 --> 18:18.910
<b>for the eyes taken from my brethren.</b>

18:18.910 --> 18:23.080
<b>I'll do whatever it takes to 
return their eyes to them.</b>

18:27.870 --> 18:30.090
<b>Will you report this to Dalzollene?</b>

18:31.670 --> 18:33.200
<b>I will not.</b>

18:33.200 --> 18:35.190
<b>I do not wish to be killed.</b>

18:35.190 --> 18:37.290
<b>You could read my intention?</b>

18:37.290 --> 18:39.440
<b>A heartbeat is always honest.</b>

18:40.270 --> 18:43.840
<b>When you began to confess 
your true nature to me,</b>

18:43.840 --> 18:46.840
<b>your heartbeat was calm, but frigid.</b>

18:47.580 --> 18:49.810
<b>The heartbeat of one</b>

18:49.810 --> 18:51.710
<b>who is prepared to kill.</b>

18:54.780 --> 18:58.860
<b>Your heart said that, though you would hold 
no grudges, I was fair game if I talked.</b>

19:00.150 --> 19:02.400
<b>Why did you take this job?</b>

19:02.990 --> 19:04.860
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

19:04.860 --> 19:07.410
<b>I'll probably lie.</b>

19:09.440 --> 19:11.630
<b>I'll know if you're lying by your eyes.</b>

19:16.040 --> 19:18.300
<b>I'm also a pro Hunter...</b>

19:18.650 --> 19:21.140
<b>A Music Hunter, I suppose.</b>

19:22.520 --> 19:25.140
<b>I'm looking for a certain musical score.</b>

19:29.880 --> 19:31.810
<b>You aren't lying,</b>

19:31.810 --> 19:34.080
<b>but you are concealing 
something important.</b>

19:35.210 --> 19:37.900
<b>Well, let's just say that you're correct.</b>

19:42.590 --> 19:45.910
<b>I'm looking for the Dark Sonata.</b>

19:49.570 --> 19:53.070
<b>A solo said to have been 
composed by the devil.</b>

19:53.070 --> 19:57.380
<b>There are four versions... 
For the piano, violin, flute, and harp.</b>

19:57.870 --> 20:00.610
<b>If a human plays or listens to the piece,</b>

20:00.610 --> 20:03.460
<b>it's said that disaster will befall them.</b>

20:05.890 --> 20:08.210
<b>Isn't that just a myth?</b>

20:08.210 --> 20:11.110
<b>I doubt something like that 
could exist in reality.</b>

20:24.960 --> 20:27.970
<b>I've heard the flute version.</b>

20:28.410 --> 20:31.210
<b>One movement alone turned me into this.</b>

20:31.640 --> 20:36.210
<b>My friend who played the piece died, 
their entire body like this.</b>

20:36.670 --> 20:40.420
<b>That friend learned a single 
movement from someone</b>

20:40.420 --> 20:43.240
<b>who said never to play the music.</b>

20:44.090 --> 20:44.970
<b>That day,</b>

20:45.530 --> 20:47.950
<b>we were drunk and giddy.</b>

20:49.090 --> 20:52.870
<b>My body was destroyed, but I 
gained this ability in return.</b>

20:53.720 --> 20:56.860
<b>However, I wish to restore my body.</b>

20:57.940 --> 20:59.950
<b>I'm willing to do anything.</b>

21:01.220 --> 21:04.240
<b>I don't want anyone else 
to end up like me.</b>

21:04.580 --> 21:07.580
<b>So I'll find the score and destroy it.</b>

21:09.700 --> 21:12.040
<b>I chose this job because</b>

21:12.040 --> 21:16.410
<b>it will be more efficient to 
work from the underworld.</b>

21:19.760 --> 21:21.010
<b>It's time.</b>

21:22.010 --> 21:23.830
<b>The underworld auction is about to start.</b>

21:29.140 --> 21:30.510
<b>It's time.</b>

21:33.440 --> 21:34.700
<b>Yes.</b>

21:38.770 --> 21:41.660
<b>The Phantom Troupe prepares 
to bare its fangs.</b>

21:41.660 --> 21:45.860
<b>How will Kurapika, now a 
Nostrade Family bodyguard,</b>

21:45.860 --> 21:48.580
<b>deal with them?</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>A Hunter hired as one

23:11.240 --> 23:12.700
<b>Watch for his Great Haikuist technique,</b>

23:12.700 --> 23:14.250
<b>which manifests any haiku he recites.</b>

23:13.780 --> 23:19.460
<b>His hobby is writing haiku, 
a form of poetry from his home.</b>

23:14.250 --> 23:15.440
<b>I'll try one.</b>

<b>"This segment is a</b>
