07:15.600 --> 07:18.046
I THOUGHT I'D TRY SOMETHING--
TRY SOMETHING NEW.

07:18.090 --> 07:18.988
CHEERS.
- OH, GOOD.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.908
- WHAT'S UP?

07:24.960 --> 07:26.882
- I MEAN, REALLY?

07:26.920 --> 07:30.640
WE NEVER REALLY TALKED
ABOUT THE DISCUSSION

07:30.690 --> 07:32.169
THAT WE HAD THE OTHER DAY.

07:32.210 --> 07:34.371
IT WAS KIND OF
AN INTENSE ONE.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.106
YOU SORT OF SAID
SOME INSULTING THINGS

07:37.140 --> 07:38.937
ABOUT MY FIANCE,
COMPARING HIM TO MY FATHER,

07:38.970 --> 07:40.858
WHO'S A DEADBEAT.
- I WASN'T INSULTING HIM.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.972
AND YOUR FATHER
IS NOT A DEADBEAT.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.319
HE HAS SOME SIMILAR ISSUES,
AND I THINK I WAS PRETTY CLEAR--

07:46.360 --> 07:48.737
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE STILL ON IT, OKAY.

07:48.770 --> 07:49.907
- NO, YOU'RE STILL ON IT.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.463
- YEAH, OF COURSE
I'M STILL ON IT,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.252
BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST
DECISION OF MY LIFE,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.256
AND YOU--YOU DON'T TRUST ME
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.881
- I DO TRUST YOU.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.672
- OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SUPPORT ME.

07:58.710 --> 07:59.847
- I'M NOT YOU, OKAY?

07:59.890 --> 08:02.051
YOU CAN MAKE ANY CHOICE
YOU WANT, AND I SUPPORT YOU.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.718
I-I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT YOU.
- BUT YOU DON'T AGREE.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.852
- I DON'T HAVE
TO AGREE WITH YOU.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.128
- OH, MY GOD.
YES, YOU DO.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.683
- I'M THERE FOR YOU,

08:09.730 --> 08:10.924
AND I'M GONNA BE THERE FOR YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

08:10.970 --> 08:13.131
- I DON'T WANT YOU
THERE FOR ME

08:13.180 --> 08:14.898
IF YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH MY BIGGEST LIFE CHOICE

08:14.940 --> 08:16.271
THAT I'M EVER GONNA MAKE.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.935
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE.
I JUST HAVE TO BE THERE FOR YOU,

08:17.980 --> 08:19.629
WHICH IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.
- IT DOES MATTER!

08:19.670 --> 08:21.114
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I SHOULD GET MARRIED.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.424
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET MARRIED,

08:22.460 --> 08:25.258
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT
GOING TO SUPPORT YOU IN THIS.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.359
- REALLY HURTING MY FEELINGS.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.731
- I HAVE TO, MOM.
- WHY?

08:27.780 --> 08:29.941
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
HANG OUT WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

08:38.930 --> 08:42.400
- HONEY, YOU DON'T WANNA
OVERWATER THOSE THINGS, DO YOU?

08:42.450 --> 08:43.826
- [chuckles]

08:43.860 --> 08:46.749
I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.654
- HEY, UH, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.349
THIS CONDO THING
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

08:50.390 --> 08:51.459
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO?

08:51.490 --> 08:52.934
YOU WANNA TAKE A TOUR OF 'EM?

08:52.980 --> 08:55.312
- WHAT?

08:55.360 --> 08:56.668
- THE CONDOS.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.906
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE,
YOU KNOW,

08:57.950 --> 09:00.259
CLOSER INTO THE CITY
AND EVERYTHING.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.973
WHAT DO YOU DO?
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:02.020 --> 09:04.568
YOU GET A REAL ESTATE PERSON,
THEY SHOW YOU AROUND?

09:04.610 --> 09:06.157
IS THAT IT?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.191
- YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.570
- I'M FREE TOMORROW.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.336
- SERIOUSLY?

09:13.380 --> 09:16.850
- YEAH.
CHECKED MY SCHEDULE.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.448
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN GOING ON
ABOUT THE CONDOS FOR--

09:19.480 --> 09:20.515
- OH, NO, YEAH.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.549

ABOUT IT,

09:21.590 --> 09:24.388
SO I'M SAYING LET'S GO
LOOK AT AN OLD CONDO,

09:24.420 --> 09:25.933

09:25.970 --> 09:28.109
- NOT SAYING
I'M GONNA LIKE IT,

09:28.150 --> 09:30.311
BUT WE'LL LOOK AT IT.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.116
YEP.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.914

09:40.820 --> 09:42.082
[doorbell chimes]

09:42.130 --> 09:43.984
- THERE'S TWO CARS
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.600
THEY'RE CLEARLY HOME.
- RIGHT.

09:45.650 --> 09:46.548
YEAH, THEY JUST DON'T WANT
TO ANSWER THE DOOR.

09:46.580 --> 09:47.990
YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM
TO ANSWER THE DOOR

09:48.030 --> 09:49.258
IF THEY DON'T WANNA.
LET'S GO.

09:49.310 --> 09:50.334
- IT'S RUDE THOUGH.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.779
SOMEONE IS RINGING
YOUR DOORBELL,

09:51.830 --> 09:52.922
YOU ANSWER THE DOOR.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.346

09:54.380 --> 09:56.723
- I DO.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.580
EXCEPT MAYBE
WHEN IT'S DINNERTIME

09:58.630 --> 10:00.598
BECAUSE THAT'S FAMILY,
AND ON PRINCIPLE,

10:00.630 --> 10:01.699
YOU DON'T INTERRUPT
FAMILY TIME.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.140

11:24.090 --> 11:25.842
- I CAN'T--

11:25.890 --> 11:27.846
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING THIS, ARE YOU?

11:27.890 --> 11:29.539
- YEAH, I AM.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.468
- THIS IS AWESOME.
- YOU LIKE IT?

11:31.510 --> 11:33.899
IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

YOU CAN WATCH MOVIES IN THIS.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.138

FOR A TEST DRIVE,

11:39.940 --> 11:41.760
AND I THINK MAYBE
THEN YOU'LL LIKE IT.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.346
- I'M NOT GONNA GO DRIVE
THIS THING.

11:42.390 --> 11:44.210
WHAT IF SOMEONE SEES ME?

11:44.250 --> 11:45.387

BE THE ONE DRIVING IT,

11:45.420 --> 11:47.149
SO, I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO TRY IT OUT.

11:47.180 --> 11:48.181

THE ONE DRIVING IT?

11:48.220 --> 11:49.699
THIS IS FOR--WE'RE NOT
GETTING RID OF MY CAR.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.116
- YEAH, WE ARE.

11:51.150 --> 11:53.630

OF MY DUCATI FOR THE HOUSE.

11:53.670 --> 11:55.535
- BUT YOUR CAR'S
WAY OLDER THAN MINE, OKAY?

11:55.570 --> 11:57.219
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TO KEEP--

11:57.260 --> 11:59.740
- YOU THINK THAT
THE TWO CARS WE'RE GONNA OWN

11:59.780 --> 12:02.157

12:12.240 --> 12:13.719

12:13.760 --> 12:14.966
- YOU ARE A TRAITOR.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.966
- LET'S GO FIND SOMEBODY
TO GIVE US A TEST DRIVE.

12:17.010 --> 12:17.999

THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.450
YOU NEED TO WATCH
THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.

12:19.490 --> 12:21.003

12:21.050 --> 12:22.665
'CAUSE THIS--
YOU SHOULDN'T BE THIS EXCITED.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.804
HONEY, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT DOING THIS, OKAY?

12:24.840 --> 12:25.568

12:25.600 --> 12:28.160

SLAM THE DOOR.

12:32.090 --> 12:34.149
- SHE, LIKE, OPENS THE DOOR
AND IS LIKE,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.156
"HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
COME ON IN."

12:36.200 --> 12:37.679
AND I'M LIKE,
"HEY, LET'S TALK

12:37.720 --> 12:40.120
"ABOUT ALL THAT INCREDIBLY
OFFENSIVE STUFF

12:40.170 --> 12:43.059
THAT YOU SAID TO ME
ABOUT MY BIGGEST LIFE CHOICE."

12:43.100 --> 12:43.998
THEN SHE'S LIKE,
"NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.066
"LET'S JUST EAT THIS EGG DISH

12:46.110 --> 12:47.372
AND PRETEND LIKE
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN."

12:47.420 --> 12:49.445
AND I'M LIKE,
"I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE

12:49.490 --> 12:50.240
"AND EAT
AN EGG DISH WITH YOU

12:50.280 --> 12:53.169
"AFTER YOU INSULTED
MY FIANCE,

12:53.220 --> 12:55.279
WHO I LOVE MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD."

12:55.320 --> 12:56.764
LIKE, IT'S JUST CRAZY.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.289
LIKE, WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

12:58.320 --> 12:59.252
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.633
- BABY, I'M SORRY.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.353
- DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME.
I MEAN, IT'S--

13:03.400 --> 13:04.981
- NO, I'M SORRY
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH, LIKE--

13:05.020 --> 13:06.874
- I'M SORRY THAT IT'S STRESSING
YOU AND YOUR MOM OUT.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.887
- IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.955
THIS IS OUR THING.
- RIGHT.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.537
- AND I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S MAKING IT ALL ABOUT HER.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.366
LIKE, SHE'S LIKE AT FIRST,
"DON'T GET MARRIED."

13:12.410 --> 13:13.923
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE,
"GET MARRIED,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.814
BUT GET MARRIED THE WAY
I WANT YOU TO GET MARRIED."

13:15.860 --> 13:16.758
- WELL, THEN LET'S
JUST NOT DO IT.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.234
LET'S NOT DO IT THEN.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.202
- NOT GET MARRIED?

13:20.240 --> 13:22.276
- NO.

13:22.310 --> 13:23.686
YES, GET MARRIED.

13:23.730 --> 13:24.867
- HEY, YOU SCARED ME.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.834
- NO, NO.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.007
NO.
- THEN WHAT?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.837
- LET'S JUST NOT DO, LIKE,
A BIG WEDDING.

13:29.870 --> 13:30.734
LET'S JUST GO DOWN
TO THE COURTHOUSE

13:30.770 --> 13:32.874
OR THE CITY HALL
AND DO IT ON OUR OWN.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.083
- LIKE ELOPE?
- YES.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.805
YEAH.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.468
HEY, I WANNA BE YOUR HUSBAND
SO BADLY NOW.

13:41.510 --> 13:44.638
SO LET'S JUST ELIMINATE
ALL THE COMPLICATIONS.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.477
YOU KNOW?

13:46.510 --> 13:49.092
HEY, YOUR MOM IS GONNA
EVENTUALLY BE ON BOARD,

13:49.130 --> 13:50.711
AND WHEN SHE IS,
THEN WE'LL THROW A BIG PARTY,

13:50.760 --> 13:51.715
AND IT'LL BE WONDERFUL.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.819
AND SHE MIGHT EVEN
HAVE GRANDKIDS BY THEN.

13:53.860 --> 13:55.794
[both chuckle]

13:55.830 --> 13:56.899
- YEAH.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.410
- BUT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT,
YOU KNOW?

13:59.450 --> 14:01.589
WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

14:01.630 --> 14:04.042
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.548
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.773
- AND THIS IS
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE ROOM,

14:16.820 --> 14:18.959
FOR A LIVING ROOM
OR A DINING SPACE.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.639
CHECK OUT THE WINDOWS.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.671
- WOW.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.028
- AND YOU'RE A PAINTER,

14:24.070 --> 14:25.753
SO THIS COULD BE A BEAUTIFUL
STUDIO SPACE FOR YOU.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.032
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,

14:29.070 --> 14:30.059
I'LL SHOW YOU
THE REST OF THE GROUNDS.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.372
THERE'S A FULL-TIME GARDENER.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.273
THERE'S DRY CLEANING
AND LAUNDRY SERVICES,

14:32.310 --> 14:34.961
24-HOUR ONSITE MAINTENANCE
OF COURSE.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.285
AND WHEN WE GET DOWNSTAIRS,

14:37.320 --> 14:39.902
I WILL SHOW YOU
THE OUTDOOR FIRE PIT AND LOUNGE.

14:39.940 --> 14:40.872
WE HAVE
A RESIDENT WINE CELLAR

14:40.910 --> 14:43.140
WITH CLIMATE-CONTROLLED
BOTTLE STORAGE.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.566
AND ALL THE EQUIPMENT
IN THE GYM DOWNSTAIRS

14:44.600 --> 14:45.976
IS STATE-OF-THE-ART.

14:46.020 --> 14:49.080
PLUS DAILY FITNESS CLASSES,
YOGA, SPINNING, ZUMBA.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.509
AND OF COURSE WE'RE
WALKING DISTANCE TO SFMOMA,

14:51.540 --> 14:52.916
THE YERBA BUENA GARDENS,

14:52.960 --> 14:54.609
AND ALL THE SHOPS
ALONG MISSION STREET.

14:54.650 --> 14:58.199
- GOOD HEAVENS.
ZUMBA.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.446
WELL, AND THERE'S SPINNING.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.469
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO SPINNING

15:00.520 --> 15:02.511
OR TRY IT ANYWAY.

15:02.550 --> 15:03.926
SO WHY DON'T WE GO OUTSIDE
AND LOOK AT THE FIRE PIT?

15:03.970 --> 15:07.724
- OKAY.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.035
- [sighs]

15:16.700 --> 15:19.112
- MR. SMITH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION.

15:19.150 --> 15:20.151
THAT IS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.

15:20.190 --> 15:23.318
UM, AS A MOTHER MYSELF,

15:23.370 --> 15:26.225
PUBLIC SAFETY IS
ONE OF MY UTMOST CONCERNS.

15:26.270 --> 15:27.339
AND--

15:27.370 --> 15:28.530
- AND BOB LITTLE
JUST CUT YOU OFF,

15:28.580 --> 15:29.365
'CAUSE YOU GAVE HIM
A REALLY LONG PAUSE.

15:29.410 --> 15:30.923
- I HAVE STAGE FRIGHT
SOMETIMES.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.052
I'M REALLY TRYING
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.237
- BUT WE DON'T WANNA SEE
THAT YOU HAVE STAGE FRIGHT.

15:33.270 --> 15:35.022
IF I'M IN THE AUDIENCE,
I'M CHECKING MY CELL PHONE.

15:35.070 --> 15:36.549
YOU'RE BORING ME.

15:36.590 --> 15:37.682
- SORRY.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.369
UM, UH, WHERE DID--

15:39.420 --> 15:41.866
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MAKE IT--
MAKE IT VERY SPECIFIC.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.551
IF YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN BEING SAFE

15:44.590 --> 15:46.217
AND HOW PUBLIC SAFETY
AFFECT S THEM OR--

15:46.250 --> 15:49.424
- I'M TRYING TO DO ALL THAT,
BUT YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING ME.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.143
- THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.
IT'S A DEBATE, OKAY?

15:51.190 --> 15:52.145
SO JUST GET USED TO IT.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.214
- MOMMY!
- HI, MY GIRL.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.421
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

15:55.470 --> 15:56.539
- HOW'S MY PEANUT?
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:56.570 --> 15:57.559
- OH, JUST A LITTLE BREAK.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.009
- NO, NO, NO.
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.322
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, COME ON.

16:00.370 --> 16:01.052
- YEAH, WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- REAL QUICK DIAPER CHANGE.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.229
- SURE, OKAY.
- WE HAD IT.

16:03.270 --> 16:03.918
SHE'S GONNA HANDLE
THE DIAPER CHANGE.

16:03.960 --> 16:04.858
- THANK YOU.

16:04.890 --> 16:05.402
I'LL NEED A COFFEE
IN A SECOND ANYWAY.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.998
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

16:07.030 --> 16:09.260
- OKAY, I'M GONNA THROW
A SOFTBALL AT YOU.

16:09.310 --> 16:11.756
"MY KIDS ARE IN A CLASS
WITH 32 KIDS THIS YEAR.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.655
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO IMPROVE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM?"

16:13.690 --> 16:15.442
THIS IS YOUR WEDGE.
THIS IS YOUR PASSION.

16:15.490 --> 16:16.684
- TOTALLY, I GOT THIS.
- LET ME SEE IT.

16:16.730 --> 16:17.719
- IT'S EASY, I GOT IT.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.102
IMPROVING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

16:19.150 --> 16:20.970
IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON
THAT I WANTED TO BECOME

16:21.010 --> 16:23.046
YOUR MAYOR OF BERKELEY.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.071
WE'VE GOT TO EMPOWER
OUR STUDENTS AND OUR PARENTS

16:25.120 --> 16:26.872
WITH MORE CHOICES
AND MORE ACCESS.

16:26.910 --> 16:27.979
THINK ABOUT THIS.

16:28.020 --> 16:28.873
I WANNA EXPAND CHARTERS
AND MAGNETS.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.707
- YOU'RE BORING ME.
YOU'RE BORING ME.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.980
- I'M NOT DONE
WITH MY THOUGHT.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.328
- YEAH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR THOUGHT.

16:33.370 --> 16:34.985
I WANT YOU TO BE PERSONAL.

16:35.020 --> 16:35.748
- GOD, YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE
RIGHT NOW.

16:35.780 --> 16:36.644
- DIG IN RIGHT THERE.
- OW!

16:36.680 --> 16:39.023
- RIGHT THERE, OKAY?
TALK ABOUT MAX.

16:39.060 --> 16:42.757
HOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
HAS AFFECTED HIM.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.542
HE'S A CHILD
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

16:44.580 --> 16:46.229
AND HOW IT'S NOT FAIR...
- OKAY, NEXT.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.133
- THAT SOME CHILDREN
GET DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,

16:49.280 --> 16:50.929
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MY SON.

16:50.970 --> 16:51.789
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT HIS ASPERGER'S.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.343
I'M SORRY.
I'LL STICK TO THE TOPICS,

16:53.390 --> 16:54.527
BUT I'M NOT DOING THAT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:54.560 --> 16:55.174
THIS IS THE BASIS
OF OUR PLATFORM.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.313
YOU DON'T WAN NA TALK ABOUT

16:57.360 --> 16:59.999
WHY YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT EDUCATION

17:00.050 --> 17:02.359
AND HOW YOUR SON'S
BEEN AFFECTED?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.221
- EDUCATION'S MY PLATFORM,
NOT MY SON.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.080
OKAY?
THAT'S IT, HE'S OFF LIMITS.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.918
NEXT QUESTION, GO.

17:09.950 --> 17:10.439
- ALL RIGHT.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.030
[indie rock music]

17:16.860 --> 17:17.952
- HEY.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.206
THESE GUYS
ARE SOUNDING GREAT.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.231
- THE SOUND OF FIVE TURDS
IN PERFECT HARMONY.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.510
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

17:23.550 --> 17:25.199
- I DROVE
A BEETLE BUG TO WORK.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.650
A SEAFOAM GREEN
BEETLE BUG TO WORK.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.348
- IS YOUR CAR IN THE SHOP
OR SOMETHING?

17:28.390 --> 17:30.972
- NO, MY CAR'S GONE FOREVER.

17:31.010 --> 17:33.001
IT WAS USED AS A TRADE-IN
AGAINST A MINIVAN,

17:33.050 --> 17:35.189
A MINIATURE VAN

17:35.220 --> 17:36.494
THAT JASMINE MADE US GET, YEAH.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:36.530 --> 17:38.589
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
- YOU ENJOY THAT NEWS?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.564
- YEAH, MY BROTHER CROSBY'S
A MINIVAN MAN.

17:41.610 --> 17:42.918
YOU'RE IN THE CLUB, BRO.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.360
WHAT'S WRONG, MAN?
THEY'RE PRACTICAL.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.129
- YOU LIKE 'EM?
- EASY IN AND OUT WITH THE KIDS.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.297
THEY CAN HAUL A LOT OF STUFF.

17:47.340 --> 17:48.671
- THEY GOT TO YOU.
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.789
YOU KNOW YOU WEREN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.060
- ALWAYS LIKE WHAT?

17:51.100 --> 17:53.546
- YOU KNOW, WEARING CORDUROYS
AND LISTENING TO NORAH JONES

17:53.580 --> 17:54.376
AND GOING TO BED BEFORE 11:00.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH CORDUROYS?

17:54.410 --> 17:56.583
WELL, I DON'T NEED
TO COMPENSATE.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.996
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AFRAID
OF THE MINIVAN.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.486
- WELL, THEY'RE SENDING A DIRECT
CLEAR MESSAGE TO FEMALES.

18:00.520 --> 18:01.691
- LISTEN TO ME,

18:01.730 --> 18:03.379
YOU'RE A HUSBAND,
YOU'RE A FATHER TOO.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.489
YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN.
OKAY?

18:04.530 --> 18:06.248
- A MINIVAN IS NOT
AGE-APPROPRIATE FOR ANYBODY...

18:06.290 --> 18:07.905
- YOU JUST GOTTA BE
A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBLE.

18:07.940 --> 18:08.929
- EVEN A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN
SHOULD NOT--

18:08.980 --> 18:10.140
- YOU CAN KEEP SWIMMING
AGAINST THE CURRENT,

18:10.190 --> 18:11.214
TIRING YOURSELF OUT,

18:11.260 --> 18:12.249
OR YOU CAN SLIP ON
SOME CORDUROYS

18:12.290 --> 18:15.259
AND JUST RELAX, MAN.
THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.086
- OR MAYBE I JUST GET
A TATTOO ACROSS MY FOREHEAD

18:17.130 --> 18:18.199
THAT SAYS, "NEUTERED."

18:18.230 --> 18:20.539
- [laughs]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:20.580 --> 18:21.717
- NO, YOU'RE
A MINIVAN MAN NOW.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.058
- JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

18:23.100 --> 18:23.987
- OH, IT'S ONE
OF THE ROCK AND ROLL KIDS.

18:24.030 --> 18:24.997
- WHEN IT'S PERFECT

18:25.030 --> 18:25.746
HOW 'BOUT THAT ACTION, HUH?

18:25.790 --> 18:27.883
- SOUNDED GREAT.
- YEAH, GREAT.

18:27.930 --> 18:29.090
- RIGHT?
- YOU WANNA GO AGAIN?

18:29.140 --> 18:30.346
- NO, IT WAS PERFECT.
THAT WAS THE TAKE.

18:30.380 --> 18:31.859
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- RIGHT?

18:31.900 --> 18:33.822
- HEY, COME ON.
- REALLY?

18:33.870 --> 18:35.201
- WE WERE THINKING

18:35.250 --> 18:37.275
MAYBE WE'D DO
ABOUT SOME DAY DRINKING.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.971
- I'M NOT A BIG
MIDDAY DRINKER.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.046
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COUNT--
- YOU LOVE MIDDAY DRINKING.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.286
- I DON'T WANNA GET BLOATED.
- I'M IN.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.287
- OH, LOOK,
SOMEBODY'S A MAN.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.662
- ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S DO THIS.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.086
- YOU WANNA JOIN ME?
- NO, I'M GOOD.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.917
- YOU AFRAID YOU'LL SOIL
YOUR CORDUROYS?

18:49.950 --> 18:51.463
- WHY DID THAT GUY
YELL AT US?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.467
- SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST RUDE, SWEETIE.

18:52.510 --> 18:54.330
- THAT GUY WAS AWESOME.

18:54.370 --> 18:57.783
- OH, PLEASE LET THIS
NOT BE A CRAZY PERSON.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.572
- THIS ISN'T LIKE
TRICK-OR-TREATING AT ALL.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.167
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE
LIKE TRICK-OR-TREATING.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.781
- YOU FELL FOR THAT?

19:02.830 --> 19:04.821
- HEY.
- THIS SUCKS.

19:04.860 --> 19:05.588
- YOU'RE JUST TOO SPOILED.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.349
- OKAY, OKAY.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.245
PUT ON
YOUR GOOD CHILDREN FACES.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.896
HEY.

I MEAN, YOU CAN COME IN
IF YOU WANT.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.827

YOU'RE ALSO NOT A GROWN-UP.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.814
BUT--

RYAN AND I HAVE DECIDED

AT CITY HALL,

20:26.120 --> 20:28.429
AND SO WE WANT YOU
TO BE OUR SPECIAL WITNESS.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.111
- WHY ARE YOU--
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.081
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WEDDING?

20:32.120 --> 20:34.156
- UM, WE JUST DIDN'T
WANNA DO IT ANYMORE,

20:34.190 --> 20:36.602

20:40.720 --> 20:43.052

20:50.420 --> 20:53.344
- OH, MY GOD.
EVERYONE CAN MAKE IT?

20:53.390 --> 20:57.030
- WELL, I MEAN,
IT WOULDN'T BE, LIKE, EVERYONE.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.867

21:12.470 --> 21:13.880
- I'M GONNA TELL HER,
LIKE, RIGHT AFTER.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.569
WE'LL HAVE, LIKE, A THING
OR SOMETHING, IT'S FINE.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.783

YOU KNOW SHE WOULD CARE.

21:17.820 --> 21:18.855

21:18.890 --> 21:20.334
WELL, WHATEVER,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MOM,

21:20.380 --> 21:22.689
BECAUSE I'VE TRIED

21:22.720 --> 21:24.824
AND SHE'S BEEN
REALLY STRESSFUL ABOUT IT

21:24.860 --> 21:26.487
AND UNSUPPORTIVE,
AND IT FEELS LIKE

21:26.520 --> 21:27.509
SHE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME
TO GET MARRIED ANYWAY.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.209
SO I DON'T EVEN
REALLY WANT HER TO BE THERE.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.287
- YEAH.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.526
- 'CAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT HER,
YOU KNOW?

21:33.560 --> 21:34.868
IT'S ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.969
- I KNOW IT'S NOT.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT.

21:37.010 --> 21:39.217
- WHAT?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

21:39.260 --> 21:41.535
- I'M--I'M HERE FOR YOU.

21:41.570 --> 21:44.391
I JUST--I CAN'T DO THAT.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.604
NO, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SAYING I--

21:49.650 --> 21:52.642
AMBER, PLEASE
JUST THINK ABOUT--

22:04.110 --> 22:05.907
- THE SUSHI BOAT
AT ELEPHANT SUSHI.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.168
- OH.
- AMAZING.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.869
- NO, THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.457
- THAT'S, LIKE, THE BIG, LIKE,
PIRATE SHIP FILLED WITH SUSHI?

22:10.500 --> 22:11.762
- YES, YES.

22:11.810 --> 22:13.118
both: OH.

22:13.150 --> 22:14.560
- THAT'S GOOD.
- IT'S SO GOOD.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.046
OH, MY GOD,
I MISS EXPENSE ACCOUNTS.

22:17.090 --> 22:17.636
- OH, YEAH.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.432
- I HAD THE BEST PURSES.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.778
- SO DID I.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.469
- [laughs]

22:22.510 --> 22:26.059
- OH, I MISS SO MUCH.
- YEAH.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.408
- I PRETTY MUCH
MISS EVERYTHING.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.407
- YEAH.

22:28.450 --> 22:31.305
EVEN THE STUFF I HATED
I MISS.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.444
- YOU KNOW, I DID THIS THING
WITH MY THERAPIST ONE TIME.

22:34.490 --> 22:36.412
- YOU'RE IN THERAPY?
- OH, YEAH, BIG-TIME.

22:36.450 --> 22:38.270
HAD, LIKE, A PIE CHART,
AND SHE SAID,

22:38.320 --> 22:39.457
"GIVE ME A LIST
OF ALL THE THINGS

22:39.490 --> 22:41.071
"THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF,

22:41.110 --> 22:43.670
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
WHAT PERCENTAGES THEY ARE."

22:43.700 --> 22:46.282
AND I SAID, "OKAY.
UM, SO WORK."

22:46.330 --> 22:47.149
- MM.

22:47.190 --> 22:49.943
- AND THEN I SAID,
"BEING A FATHER."

22:49.980 --> 22:52.369
- SHE SAID,
"WHAT ABOUT HOBBIES?"

22:52.400 --> 22:54.197
- HOBBIES, WHAT ARE THOSE?
- EXACTLY.

22:54.230 --> 22:56.118
SO ANYWAY,

22:56.160 --> 23:00.608
IT'S, LIKE, 75% WORK
AND 25% BEING A FATHER.

23:00.650 --> 23:02.231
- MM-HMM.
- I WAS REALLY LYING.

23:02.270 --> 23:04.306
IT'S MORE LIKE 90%, 10%.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.921
- YOU LIE TO YOUR THERAPIST?

23:05.970 --> 23:07.369
- OH, YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.173
COME ON, I DON'T WANT HER
TO THINK I'M A JERK.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.313
YEP.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.274
BUT REALLY THE POINT IS

23:14.320 --> 23:16.208
I KNOW I WAS
A REALLY GOOD SALESMAN.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.592
- YEAH.

23:17.630 --> 23:21.077
- I'M JUST NOT SO SURE
I'M A GOOD FATHER.

23:23.330 --> 23:24.399
- YEAH.

23:24.430 --> 23:28.184
WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE
A HOBBY NOW

23:28.230 --> 23:29.572
WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY
COMMITTEE.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.714
- AH!
WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.196
- AND THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL GREAT ABOUT YOURSELF.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.400
- GOD.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.680
- DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOD?
I'M HUNGRY.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.756
- OH, VICTOR, THAT'S RUDE.
I'M SORRY.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.337
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO ANYWAY.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.369
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.489
- I'M STARVING.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.511
- TROOPS ARE HUNGRY.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.344
FISH STICKS, 15 MINUTES.

23:50.390 --> 23:51.357
LET'S DO IT.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.971
- OKAY.

23:53.010 --> 23:56.047
- KNOW WHAT,
I AM SO SICK OF KID FOOD.

23:56.080 --> 23:56.944
- YES.

23:56.980 --> 23:58.629
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MAKE SOMETHING,

23:58.670 --> 24:00.080
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE WE USED TO EAT

24:00.120 --> 24:01.326
WHEN WE WERE NORMAL PEOPLE?

24:01.370 --> 24:02.814
- OKAY.

24:02.850 --> 24:03.885
- ALL RIGHT.

24:08.300 --> 24:11.098
- [grunts]

24:13.140 --> 24:13.959
- I KNEW IT.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.854
YOU WAIT FOR US ALL
TO MOVE OUT,

24:15.900 --> 24:17.754
AND THEN YOU BUILD
THE POOL.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.928
- IT'S NOT A POOL.
IT'S A FIRE PIT FOR YOUR MOTHER.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.143
- WHAT DOES SHE WANT
WITH A FIRE PIT?

24:23.180 --> 24:26.308
- WELL, JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE A NICE LITTLE ADDITION,

24:26.360 --> 24:27.281
THAT'S ALL.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.562
- WEIRD.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.828
YOU'RE GETTING A FIRE PIT?

24:31.880 --> 24:33.461
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED A FIRE PIT.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.776
- NEITHER DID I.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.469
- [sighs]

24:38.510 --> 24:39.602
- HOW'S AMBER?

24:39.650 --> 24:41.094
HOW'S THE WEDDING
PLANNING GOING?

24:41.130 --> 24:43.269
- PFFI'.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.882
- UH-OH.

24:45.930 --> 24:47.067
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:47.100 --> 24:48.544
- I TOLD HER I THOUGHT

24:48.590 --> 24:51.548
SHE WAS TOO YOUNG.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.444
- OH.
HUH, HOW'D THAT GO?

24:53.490 --> 24:55.720
- OH, GREAT.
REALLY WONDERFUL.

24:55.770 --> 24:58.147
SHE'S NOT SPEAKING TO ME,
BUT BESIDES THAT...

24:58.180 --> 24:59.386
- AND YOU'RE SURPRISED?

24:59.420 --> 25:00.762
- WELL, YES, I'M SURPRISED.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.314
I'M SURPRISED SHE WOULDN'T
WANT MY OPINION.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.567
I MEAN, SHE'S 21 YEARS OLD.
WHY CAN'T SHE WAIT?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.044
- SHE DOESN'T WANNA WAIT.

25:07.090 --> 25:10.708
SHE'S IN LOVE, AND SHE WANTS
TO GET MARRIED NOW.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.365
- WAIT IS THAT?

25:12.400 --> 25:13.776
- WHAT?

25:13.820 --> 25:15.264
- UH-HUH?
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

25:15.300 --> 25:17.643
THAT'S--THAT'S--

25:17.680 --> 25:21.514
OH, MOTHER, IT'S NOT JUST
LIKE ME AND SETH.

25:21.550 --> 25:22.858
- IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE YOU AND SETH.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.549
- IT'S NOT.
- IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.069
- NO, IT ISN'T.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.271
- HOW MANY TIMES DID WE
TELL YOU, "SLOW DOWN AND WAIT"?

25:28.310 --> 25:31.939
"WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH?
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT NOW?"

25:31.970 --> 25:34.621
REMEMBER?

25:34.670 --> 25:37.559
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE SAID BACK THEN?

25:39.330 --> 25:43.118
I KNOW
WHAT I WISH WE'D SAID.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.843
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.462
BECAUSE YOU WERE GONNA
BE WITH SETH ANYWAY.

25:47.510 --> 25:49.649
AND BECAUSE
WE SAID SOMETHING,

25:49.680 --> 25:52.331
WE KINDA LOST YOU THERE
FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

25:52.370 --> 25:56.158
AND WE MISSED YOU.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.168
- THOSE ARE MY CHOICES?

25:59.210 --> 26:03.692
I JUST STAND BY AND WATCH HER
MAKE A HUGE MISTAKE,

26:03.730 --> 26:06.836
OR I LOSE MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER ALTOGETHER?

26:06.870 --> 26:09.555
- AMBER'S GONNA DO
WHAT HER HEART TELLS HER TO DO.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.147
YOU KNOW, AND MAYBE
IT'LL BE A MISTAKE,

26:11.190 --> 26:12.179
AND MAYBE IT WON'T,

26:12.220 --> 26:15.280
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HER WAY.

26:17.470 --> 26:19.392
- IT'S HARD.

26:19.430 --> 26:21.250
- YEAH.

26:21.300 --> 26:24.360
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

26:29.130 --> 26:30.688
- OKAY, HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.711
THIS ONE'S IT.
THIS ONE'S FOR THE GOLD.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.784
- BADA- BADA- BADA.

26:33.830 --> 26:35.036
- I MAKE THIS ONE,

26:35.070 --> 26:36.344
YOU GUYS HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THE HUMILIATION

26:36.380 --> 26:38.245
OF BEING BEATEN BY A GUY
WHO DRIVES A MINIVAN.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.315
DRUM ROLL, PLEASE!

26:39.350 --> 26:41.409
- NO, NO, NO.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.348
[cheering]

26:43.390 --> 26:45.278
- WHOO-HOO-HOO!

26:45.320 --> 26:46.662
BOTTOMS UP.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.214
I'LL JOIN YOU AS AN ACT
OF SOLIDARITY.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.876
- NO, REMATCH.
I WANT A REMATCH ON THAT.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.296
- THERE'S NO REMATCHES.
- DO-OVERS, I CALL DO-OVERS.

26:53.330 --> 26:57.881
- OKAY, SHH.
IT'S MY WIFE.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.332
HEY, HON.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.429
YEAH, LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.617
[indistinct chatter,
laughter]

27:03.650 --> 27:06.027
UH-HUH.
AND DIAPER CREAM.

27:06.070 --> 27:07.332
GOT IT.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.439
I LOVE YOU TOO.
BYE.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.199
OKAY, I TOTALLY FORGOT

27:12.250 --> 27:13.820
THAT I HAVE DINNER
AT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.724
I GOTTA GO GET SOY ICE CREAM
RIGHT NOW FOR HER

27:15.770 --> 27:17.488
AND SOME
BABY DIAPER RASH CREAM.

27:17.530 --> 27:19.009
- EHH!
- I'M OUTTA HERE.

27:19.050 --> 27:19.903
- I'M SO SOI-T.

27:19.940 --> 27:21.043
- AND YOU GUYS
GOTTA COME TOO.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.320
- CROSBY,
YOU SHOULDN'T DRIVE.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.351
- I'M NOT GONNA DRIVE.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.628
I'M GONNA TAKE A CAB
OVER TO THE GROCERY STORE,

27:25.670 --> 27:28.946
AND THEN I'LL TAKE ANOTHER ONE
OVER TO MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.946
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE
YOUR WIFE PICK YOU UP?

27:30.990 --> 27:33.982
- LIGHT BULB, YES.
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

27:34.030 --> 27:35.190
- YES, AND THEN SHE
COULD GIVE US A LII-T HOME,

27:35.230 --> 27:36.959
AND THEN WE WOULD BE
RESPONSIBLE HUMANS.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.093
- THAT COULD WORK.
I'M GONNA CALL HER.

27:39.140 --> 27:39.879
- OH, AND THERE'S
A SWEET BURGER JOINT

27:39.930 --> 27:41.966
THAT WE CAN HIT
ON THE WAY HOME.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.888
- YEAH, I DO WANT A BURGER,
YEAH.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.273
HONEY, HEY, COULD YOU--
DON'T BE MAD AT ME PLEASE.

27:46.310 --> 27:49.029
COULD YOU THINK
YOU COULD PICK ME UP

27:49.080 --> 27:51.412
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE WITH
A COUPLE OF MY GOOD BUDDIES?

27:51.460 --> 27:52.688
- OKAY, SO THAT ONE'S DONE.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.526
- HOW MANY SINGLE
NEW HOME BUILDING PERMITS

27:54.560 --> 27:55.731
WERE APPROVED IN 2012?

27:55.770 --> 27:58.659
- MAX, I DON'T HAVE
TO KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.938
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG.
THE ANSWER'S FIVE.

27:59.980 --> 28:00.594
- YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO GATHERED
IN THE CENTER.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.426
- MOM, IT'S IN THE PACKET,

28:02.470 --> 28:03.812
AND YOU TOLD ME TO QUIZ YOU
ON WHAT'S IN THE PACKET.

28:03.850 --> 28:04.885
- I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW
THE EXACT NUMBER.

28:04.920 --> 28:05.841
- MOM, YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
AT ALL.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.460
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE READY
FOR THE DEBATE.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.091
I MEAN, I COULDN'T EVEN
MEMORIZE ALL OF THESE,

28:09.130 --> 28:10.643
AND I HAVE
A REALLY EXCELLENT MEMORY.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.886
- I KNOW THAT, BABE.
- THIS GREEN?

28:11.930 --> 28:13.192
- MY MEMORY'S
A LOT BETTER THAN YOURS,

28:13.240 --> 28:14.309
AND I COULDN'T DO IT.
- GREEN IS PERFECT.

28:14.340 --> 28:15.546
- YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THE DEBATE

28:15.590 --> 28:17.342
BECAUSE THE POLLS SAY THAT
IT'S STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

28:17.380 --> 28:18.824
FOR YOU TO WIN.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.339
- NO, MAX.
NO, IT'S NOT.

28:20.380 --> 28:21.893
- WELL, NO, IT'S NOT
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE

28:21.940 --> 28:23.828
BECAUSE HARRY TRUMAN
WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

28:23.870 --> 28:26.452
IN 1948 WITH ONLY .17%
OF THE POPULAR PRIMARY VOTE.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.378
- USE THIS ONE.

28:28.430 --> 28:30.284
- BUT THEN HE DROPPED
AN ATOMIC BOMB ON JAPAN.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.834
- I'M NOT GONNA DROP
AN ATOMIC BOMB ON ANYBODY.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.666
- OH, MY GOD.
- SMELLS STALE.

28:34.710 --> 28:35.938
- [sneezes]
HEATHER, PLEASE.

28:35.990 --> 28:37.639
- I THINK THE REASON
THAT YOU'RE DOING SO BAD

28:37.680 --> 28:38.988
IN THE POLLS, RIGHT,

28:39.020 --> 28:40.772
IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE A VENDING MACHINE.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.333
I PROMISED EVERYBODY
A VENDING MACHINE, AND SO I WON.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.996
- OH, MY GOSH,
THIS LOOKS AMAZING.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.964
- WELL, YOU MADE THE SAUCE.
I JUST PLATED IT.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.377
- WELL, YOU HAVE
EXCELLENT PLATING SKILLS.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.409
- BETTER THAN OURS.

28:55.450 --> 28:57.179
- NO, IT'S NOT.
TRUST ME.

28:57.210 --> 29:00.099
OH, GOD, THAT'S--
OH, IT'S DISGUSTING.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.071
ISN'T IT, JULIA?

29:01.110 --> 29:02.008
- I CAN BARELY
CHOKE THIS DOWN.

29:02.050 --> 29:04.280
THIS IS--

29:04.320 --> 29:05.116
- YOU'RE LYING.

29:05.150 --> 29:08.039
- MM, NO.
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

29:08.090 --> 29:09.876
SYDNEY, DON'T FORGET
YOUR CARROTS.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.911
- AT HOME, WE ONLY HAVE
TO EAT FOUR CARROTS.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.292
- FOUR CARROTS?

29:13.330 --> 29:14.911
WHAT KIND OF HOVEL
ARE YOU RUNNING OVER THERE?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.712
- LISTEN.
- FOUR?

29:16.750 --> 29:17.466
- HOW ABOUT MORE THAN FOUR
TONIGHT?

29:17.510 --> 29:20.263
- HELLO.
- MOMMY!

29:20.310 --> 29:21.334
- HI.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.473
HI, GUYS.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.728
OH.
- HEY.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.375
COLLEEN,
YOU REMEMBER JULIA.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.376
VICTOR AND SYDNEY'S MOM.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.489
- HI.
YES, YES.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.556
HI, JULIA.
HOW ARE YOU?

29:33.590 --> 29:35.034
- I'M GOOD, THANK YOU.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.593
WE'RE JUST, UM--
WE'RE JUST LEAVING.

29:36.630 --> 29:37.483
WE WERE CANVASSING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

29:37.530 --> 29:41.148
MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S
RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.908
AND THEN THE KIDS RAN INTO EACH
OTHER, AND THEY WERE HUNGRY.

29:42.950 --> 29:44.633
AND SO HERE WE ARE.
BUT WE'RE JUST LEAVING.

29:44.670 --> 29:45.841
SO LET'S GO.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.256
- I DIDN'T GET
TO FINISH MY DINNER.

29:47.300 --> 29:47.982
- THAT'S OKAY.
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.294
THEY CAN FINISH THEIR DINNER.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.194
- NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S SO KIND OF YOU,

29:50.230 --> 29:51.811
BUT DADDY'S WAITING
FOR US AT HOME.

29:51.850 --> 29:52.919
- I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
MY CARROTS EITHER.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.574
- THAT'S OKAY.
LET'S GO NOW.

29:53.610 --> 29:57.091
COME ON, VICTOR.
LET'S GO.

29:57.140 --> 29:59.131
AND IT WAS SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU, COLLEEN.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.683
- IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.755
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.448
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

30:02.490 --> 30:03.229
- YOU GUYS TOO.
- OKAY.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.692
- GOOD LUCK
WITH THE CAMPAIGN.

30:05.730 --> 30:06.936
- THANK YOU.
- BYE.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.382
- NO PROBLEM.
- SEE YOU SOON.

30:09.420 --> 30:12.833
- YOU HUNGRY?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.279
- YEAH.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.709
- WHO'S GOT
THE DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER?

30:16.740 --> 30:17.843
- ME.
- ME!

30:17.880 --> 30:19.108
- ME, ME, ME.
- OH, HEY.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.980
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
NO FIGHTING,

30:21.020 --> 30:22.464
OR NO ONE GETS ANYTHING.

30:22.510 --> 30:23.636
- I AM GONNA WATCH THE BABY

30:23.680 --> 30:24.886
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK,
I PROMISE.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.911
- FOR TWO WEEKS.
HERE YOU GO.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.188
- THANK YOU.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.855
- HOW'D YOU GET
SUCH A HOT WIFE?

30:29.890 --> 30:30.504
- I KNOCKED HER UP.

30:30.550 --> 30:32.996
- YEAH.
- [sighs] GOD.

30:33.030 --> 30:34.713
- GOTTA GET ON THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.442
WE HAVE TO BE HOME
IN 20 MINUTES.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.414
SO WHOEVER LIVES THE CLOSEST,

30:37.450 --> 30:38.963
THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE
IS GETTING OUT, SO...

30:39.000 --> 30:41.104
- WE ALL LIVE TOGETHER.
- ALL TOGETHER.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.768
- HA HA.
OF COURSE YOU DO.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.767
- THEY LIVE TOGETHER.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.620
[indistinct chatter]

30:46.670 --> 30:49.047
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.729
OH, YOU HAVE TELEVISION
IN THIS CAR.

30:50.770 --> 30:52.180
- YES, WE DO.
- WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?

30:52.220 --> 30:54.017
- WELL, YOU GOT SPONGEBOB
AND ADVENTURE TIME.

30:54.050 --> 30:54.732
- OOH, OOH, ADVENTURE TIME.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.816
- YES, THAT'S THE RIGHT PICK.

30:56.850 --> 30:57.817
- THERE YOU GO.

30:57.850 --> 30:59.329
- THIS IS AWESOME.

30:59.370 --> 31:02.783
- I WANT TO LIVE
IN THIS VEHICLE OF THE FUTURE.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.993
- CROSBY, YOU HAVE
THE BEST WIFE EVER.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.897
- YEAH.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.921
[chuckles]

31:14.940 --> 31:15.895
- HI, DADDY.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.658
- OH.
- HEY!

31:17.700 --> 31:18.416
THERE YOU ARE.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.873
HI, GUYS.
- WOW, WHAT IS THIS?

31:21.910 --> 31:25.118
- HEY, STUDLY, HOW ARE YOU?
LOOK AT YOU GUYS.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.014
AWESOME.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.223
- THIS IS SOMETHING HERE.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.568
- THIS IS, UH--
THIS WOULD BE DINNER.

31:29.610 --> 31:31.157
- I SEE THAT.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.259
- I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
BACK IN THE DAY,

31:32.300 --> 31:34.154
WE USED TO EAT
AS A FAMILY.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.168
I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAYBE DO THAT AGAIN, SO...

31:36.200 --> 31:37.235
- WE ALREADY ATE.
- CHICKEN PARMESAN.

31:37.270 --> 31:37.986
- WELL...

31:38.030 --> 31:40.169
- FISH STICKS,
NOT YOUR KIND.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.849
- A SNACK OIgHA PLAYDATE.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.924
- LISTEN, IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T HUNGRY,

31:42.970 --> 31:45.029
WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND
SOMETHING TO WATCH ON TV?

31:45.070 --> 31:45.729
I AM STARVING.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.409
- TV?
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT?

31:47.450 --> 31:49.384
- ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.928
- I AM--
- WOW.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.481
YOU MUST REALLY BE HUNGRY

31:54.530 --> 31:56.350
IF YOU'RE LETTING THEM
WATCH TV ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.

31:56.390 --> 31:58.529
- I'M STARVING MYSELF.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FISH STICKS.

31:58.570 --> 32:00.390
- OKAY, GOOD.

32:00.430 --> 32:03.046
UM...

32:03.090 --> 32:04.603
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.438
I FELT REALLY BAD
FOR BAILING ON CANVASSING.

32:07.470 --> 32:08.676
- OH.

32:08.710 --> 32:12.851
- AND, UH, I'M--

32:12.890 --> 32:14.949
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
REALLY STRESSED,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.513
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY

32:16.550 --> 32:20.304
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SUCH A GOOD JOB WITH THESE TWO.

32:20.350 --> 32:23.410
AND, UM,
AND I COULDN'T BE ABLE--

32:23.450 --> 32:25.384
BE ABLE TO DO
WHAT I'M DOING WITHOUT YOU.

32:25.420 --> 32:27.388
SO...

32:30.530 --> 32:33.283
SO THANK YOU.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.628
YOU READY TO EAT
ALL OF THIS?

32:41.680 --> 32:42.465
- ALL OF IT.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.717
- I'M SO--
[microphone feedback]

32:44.750 --> 32:47.435
SORRY.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.573
I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION.

32:49.620 --> 32:52.965
AS A CITIZEN OF BERKELEY
FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS

32:53.000 --> 32:54.479
AND A MOTHER OF THREE,

32:54.520 --> 32:56.306
PUBLIC SAFETY
IS MY UTMOST CONCERN.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.864
JUST LEARNING
HOW TO NAVIGATE--

32:58.900 --> 33:01.175
- KRISTINA AND I
WORKED TOGETHER,

33:01.220 --> 33:02.380
AND SHE IS
A WONDERFUL MOTHER.

33:02.420 --> 33:04.661
- THANK YOU.

33:04.700 --> 33:08.215
- BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.421
AS THE COMPTROLLER
OF BERKELEY DURING MY--

33:10.470 --> 33:11.152
- YOU CUT BACK
ON POLICE FOOT PATROLS

33:11.190 --> 33:13.943
IN ALMOST EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.218
SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BOB.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.228
- I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP, TONY.

33:17.270 --> 33:18.430
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY DAUGHTER
WAS LITTLE,

33:18.470 --> 33:19.437
SHE USED TO WALK TO SCHOOL
BY HERSELF.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.436
- PEACE OF MIND--
I'M SORRY, JUST, KRISTINA,

33:21.480 --> 33:22.469
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO FINISH
THIS ONE THOUGHT

33:22.510 --> 33:23.647
ONLY BECAUSE
IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

33:23.690 --> 33:25.339
AND, TONY, THANK YOU
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.348
PEACE OF MIND
IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.372
AND THAT'S
WHY AS COMPTROLLER

33:30.420 --> 33:33.207
I LAID THE GROUNDWORK
FOR A NEW SYSTEM.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.525
RESIDENTS THEMSELVES
COULD REVIEW CRIME DATA

33:35.560 --> 33:37.869
WITHIN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD
AND ACROSS THE CITY.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.457
OPENING THE DOORS
OF CITY HALL

33:39.500 --> 33:41.286
IS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF A DIALOGUE

33:41.320 --> 33:43.527
BETWEEN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE

33:43.570 --> 33:45.800
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF THIS COMMUNITY

33:45.850 --> 33:48.114
SO THAT YOU DON'T JUST KNOW
WHAT DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING

33:48.160 --> 33:49.741
BUT WHY WE'RE MAKING THEM.

33:49.780 --> 33:51.919
AND SHOULDN'T
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF BERKELEY

33:51.960 --> 33:54.053
EXPECT THAT
OUT OF THEIR GOVERNMENT?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.431
THANK YOU.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.333
[applause]

34:00.000 --> 34:01.547
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

34:01.590 --> 34:04.104
- THANK YOU, MR. LITTLE.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.313
ANYONE ELSE?

34:06.350 --> 34:11.037
NEXT QUESTION
COMES FROM CAROLINE LEE.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.968
- HI.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.147
- HI, CAROLINE.

34:14.190 --> 34:15.384
- HI.
- CAROLINE.

34:15.430 --> 34:19.048
UM, MY QUESTION
IS ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.115
UH, WE'RE NEW TO TOWN,

34:21.160 --> 34:23.742
AND I'VE JUST PUT EMMA
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

34:23.780 --> 34:24.940
- MM-HMM.

34:24.990 --> 34:27.458
- UM, EMMA IS SPECIAL NEEDS.

34:27.510 --> 34:29.603
SHE'S DEAF.

34:29.650 --> 34:33.336
AND OVER AND OVER,
I'VE BEEN PROMISED

34:33.380 --> 34:37.441
THAT SHE WOULD
HAVE MORE HELP,

34:37.480 --> 34:38.754
AND SHE DOESN'T.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.655
AND...

34:42.800 --> 34:44.449
- WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE--

34:44.490 --> 34:46.720
- I'D LOVE TO JUST JUMP
ON THIS QUESTION.

34:46.770 --> 34:49.182
AS A PRODUCT OF THE BERKELEY
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM MYSELF,

34:49.220 --> 34:51.973
I CAN ATTEST
THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HERE

34:52.020 --> 34:52.975
IS PROBABLY
THE BEST IN THE STATE.

34:53.020 --> 34:53.873
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BOB?

34:53.910 --> 34:55.730
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I THINK CAROLINE

34:55.780 --> 34:57.395
WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NOW,

34:57.440 --> 34:58.839
NOT WHEN YOU WERE THERE.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.360
SORRY, SO, CAROLINE,
HOW OLD IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.789
- SHE'S TEN, AND I HAVE
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.026
- AWW.

35:05.060 --> 35:07.267
I HAVE A SON, MAX.
HE'S 13.

35:07.310 --> 35:10.234
AND, UM, HE WAS
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.679
HE WAS, AND THEN
HE WENT TO PRIVATE.

35:11.730 --> 35:13.345
NOW HE'S BACK IN PUBLIC.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.826
SO WHEN I SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

35:15.870 --> 35:17.314
BELIEVE ME,
MY HUSBAND AND I,

35:17.350 --> 35:20.660
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH COMPLETELY.

35:20.700 --> 35:21.689
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY

35:21.740 --> 35:22.525
THAT THE BERKELEY
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

35:22.560 --> 35:24.596
IS ONE OF THE BEST
IN THE STATE,

35:24.630 --> 35:26.518
AND I TEND
TO AGREE WITH THAT.

35:26.570 --> 35:30.188
AND WHILE THEY WORK
FOR MOST KIDS,

35:30.230 --> 35:31.845
WHAT CAROLINE AND I UNDERSTAND

35:31.880 --> 35:33.507
IS WHAT WORKS FOR SOME KIDS

35:33.540 --> 35:34.222
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK
FOR ALL KIDS,

35:34.270 --> 35:37.057
LIKE YOUR EMMA
AND MY MAX.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.431
AND IF THAT
ISN'T THE CASE,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.573
THEN I FEEL LIKE
THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.863
MY SON HAS
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME,

35:49.900 --> 35:52.653
AND MY HUSBAND AND I
HAVE FOUGHT THE SYSTEM

35:52.700 --> 35:53.519
TIME AND TIME AGAIN

35:53.560 --> 35:57.280
TO MAKE SURE
HE GETS WHAT HE NEEDS,

35:57.320 --> 35:58.491
THAT HE'S NOT OVERLOOKED.

35:58.530 --> 36:01.419
AND I CAN SEE THAT THAT'S
HOW YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.020
- YEAH.
- TO SAY THE LEAST.

36:04.050 --> 36:06.746
YOU KNOW, MY SON, MAX,
IS A FIGHTER,

36:06.780 --> 36:08.327
AND I'M TELLING YOU WHAT,

36:08.370 --> 36:10.190
HE WILL NOT GIVE UP
UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS.

36:10.230 --> 36:12.573
AND SOMETIMES,
AS A PARENT,

36:12.610 --> 36:14.362
THAT CAN BE
A LITTLE CHALLENGING.

36:14.410 --> 36:15.684
I'M SURE YOU ALL CAN...

36:15.720 --> 36:16.709
[laughter]

36:16.760 --> 36:19.991
CAN RELATE TO THAT.

36:20.030 --> 36:22.339
BUT ON BEHALF OF MAX,

36:22.380 --> 36:24.519
I'VE BECOME A FIGHTER TOO.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.481
AND IF I'M ELECTED
YOUR MAYOR OF BERKELEY,

36:25.520 --> 36:28.387
I PROMISE
TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.480
I PROMISE TO FIGHT
FOR YOUR SPECIFIC CHILD,

36:31.530 --> 36:34.044
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GETS
WHAT SHE NEEDS.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.493
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

36:37.540 --> 36:41.180
YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GONNA, UM...

36:41.230 --> 36:42.151
OKAY.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.021
SO SORRY, I--

36:45.060 --> 36:47.437
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:47.480 --> 36:51.064
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.715
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME.
I MEAN THAT.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.206
I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU,
AND I WILL WORK FOR YOU.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.548
I PROMISE.
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.933
- CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG?

36:58.970 --> 36:59.516
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I NEED A HUG.

36:59.560 --> 37:04.350
[cheers and applause]

37:13.260 --> 37:16.502
- MILLIE!
MILLIE! MILLIE!

37:16.540 --> 37:18.644
CHECK HER OUT, COME ON.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.363
IF YOU WILL,

37:20.410 --> 37:22.469
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:26.270 --> 37:28.204
- OH, ZEEK,
THANKS FOR DOING THIS FOR ME.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.993
- YEAH.
GUESS WHAT.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.928
CONTAIN YOURSELF.

37:32.970 --> 37:33.937
[chuckles]

37:33.970 --> 37:35.653
HUH?

37:35.700 --> 37:38.760
LOOK AT THIS.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.210
YEP.

37:40.250 --> 37:44.209
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.637
I TALKED TO LINDA,
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT,

37:46.670 --> 37:49.389
