{\an8}(Madisson)
In Siesta Key,
it's easy to fall in love.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.509
{\an8}I've had feelings for Alex
since high school.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.094
{\an7}(Alex)
We should make
more of an effort

00:11.177 --> 00:12.762
{\an8}to, like, hang out again.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
{\an8}(Madisson)
And even though I still
have those feelings...

00:14.931 --> 00:17.726
{\an8}Yeah, and just stay
friends this time.

00:17.809 --> 00:21.062
{\an8}I realized that we were better
off as friends... for now.

00:21.146 --> 00:25.442
And suddenly, at Alex's gala...

00:25.525 --> 00:27.569
Brandon was looking
really cute to me.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.779
{\an5}You look handsome.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.779
You look incredible.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.781
(Madisson)
It was a crazy night.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.160
Juliette was pissed at Alex
for hooking up with Amanda.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.077
It happened, right?

00:35.243 --> 00:36.077
{\an1}It did.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.456
But Alex had already
moved on from her

00:39.539 --> 00:41.791
and was busy trying
to steal Kelsey from Garrett.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.127
{\an1}We're all going swimming
later if you wanna...

00:44.210 --> 00:45.628
Get to know you better.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.963
{\an5}(Madisson)
No shocker that
Kelsey and Garrett

00:47.046 --> 00:48.298
weren't getting along at all.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.133
{\an1}Seems like you always
wanna be around him, so...

00:50.216 --> 00:51.760
{\an5}I literally said--

00:50.216 --> 00:51.760
Well, I'm gonna go.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.303
(Madisson)
And I knew it wouldn't be long

00:53.386 --> 00:56.264
before the rumors started
flying in Siesta Key.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.482
{\an1}(Madisson)
What's wrong?

01:05.565 --> 01:08.151
Just, like, me and Garrett
are not doing good.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.903
{\an8}He thinks, like,
something's happened

01:09.986 --> 01:12.322
{\an8}between me and Alex
and I was just trying

01:12.405 --> 01:13.990
{\an8}to be friendly and, like,
that was it.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.158
{\an8}It wasn't anything like,
"Oh, my God,

01:15.241 --> 01:18.369
{\an8}like, let's go on a date,"
or, blah, blah, blah.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.621
{\an8}It was nothing like that,

01:19.704 --> 01:21.331
{\an7}but that's how, like,
Garrett took it.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.707
{\an1}Did you guys
come here together?

01:22.791 --> 01:24.918
Yeah. We're not leaving
here together, though.

just trying to be social.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.840

immature to just...

like, I didn't even know...

03:04.517 --> 03:07.270

the wrong way

to some other dudes?

go hang out with them

06:47.406 --> 06:49.826

Yeah, yeah, I think that ship
has sailed for the both of us.

07:47.884 --> 07:53.389
{\an5}So, how would you feel
if Madisson and Brandon
hooked up?

07:53.472 --> 07:56.058
{\an1}As long as he treats her
all right.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.062
{\an1}Huh. Well, we'll see how
they are at the beach today.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.524
How is it being around
Amanda and Juliette?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.027
{\an1}Juliette is so, like,
rude to me now.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.404
{\an1}Like, I don't know why.
Like, it's like, she can--

08:08.487 --> 08:10.740
{\an1}I'm-- like, I mean,
I get why.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.366
{\an3}Alex...

08:10.823 --> 08:12.366
{\an1}I get why.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.743
But, like...

08:12.450 --> 08:13.743
You know why.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.453
{\an1}No, but, like, she didn't
even, like, thank me

08:15.536 --> 08:16.746
for having her here.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.080
{\an1}She's like,
"All right, well, see ya,"

08:18.164 --> 08:19.248
{\an1}and, like, walks right off,
like...

08:19.332 --> 08:20.666
{\an1}I don't know, the way
she was talking to me about it

08:20.750 --> 08:23.920
{\an1}was, like, she wants to be
able to be friends with you,

08:24.003 --> 08:25.338
so it doesn't seem
like she's--

08:25.421 --> 08:27.089
{\an1}She's not doing that
at all.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.090
Well, I left.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.593
What happened, like,
at the end of the party?

08:30.676 --> 08:33.929
Did people stay here
really late?

08:34.013 --> 08:35.264
{\an1}Yeah.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.225
{\an3}What?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.225
Well, I mean,

08:37.308 --> 08:39.227
{\an1}we all just were in
the hot tub and stuff.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.770
Who's "we all"?

08:40.852 --> 08:41.854
{\an1}Um...

08:41.938 --> 08:43.773
{\an1}We all.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.650
Why are you being weird?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.443
Did Kelsey stay?

08:47.526 --> 08:49.862
She was here.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.862
{\an3}Of course.

08:49.946 --> 08:50.446
{\an1}Well, it got
a little crazy.

08:50.529 --> 08:53.032
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.700
{\an3}My God.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.744
{\an5}(Madisson)
The night of the gala
was a total blur,

08:56.827 --> 08:59.080
and I was pretty sure
that nothing went down

08:59.163 --> 09:01.791
between Kelsey and Alex,
but around here,

09:01.874 --> 09:04.502
the truth always comes out.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.047
♪ You want to hear me sing ♪

09:08.130 --> 09:10.633
♪ You gotta put a little
bling in my jar ♪

09:10.716 --> 09:12.218
♪ I've been trying so hard ♪

09:12.301 --> 09:15.054
♪ It's not as easy
as I let on ♪

09:15.137 --> 09:16.806
{\an8}(Alex)
What a nice day.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.141
{\an7}We are playing flip cup
for sure.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.185
{\an8}(Pauly)
What a party last night,
though, I'll tell you.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.312
{\an8}(Chloe)
No, that party was epic.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.022
{\an8}Tell him what you woke up
with on your chest.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.233
{\an8}You woke up with a slice
of pizza on your chest?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.026
{\an8}(Alex)
Woke up with a half-eaten
slice of pizza

09:29.110 --> 09:31.237
{\an8}right on her chest.
Oh, whoa!

09:31.320 --> 09:33.364
♪ Here we go, here we go,
uh-oh ♪

09:33.447 --> 09:35.658
♪ Here we go,
here we go, uh-uh-oh ♪

09:35.741 --> 09:36.826
♪ Here we go... ♪

09:36.909 --> 09:38.077
{\an3}(Madisson)
Oh, my God.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.204
{\an4}(Brandon)
Oh, yeah.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.204
I'm so screwed.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.497
I'll wait for Amanda
to get here.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.333
I'll tell her
what you just did.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.502
{\an4}(Pauly)
Oh, there she is,
speaking of the devil.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
{\an7}(Alex)
Speak of the devil.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.131
{\an5}What's up, guys?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.131
Hide the gloves.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.465
{\an5}Hide the gloves.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.465
That's hilarious.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.842
{\an5}Ooh, this looks good.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.842
What's going on?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.844
{\an6}Hi.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.844
{\an1}(Brandon)
Got in right for flip cup.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.971
(Kelsey)
Perfect view today. Dang.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.265
{\an8}They went all out.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.850
{\an8}Yeah, yeah.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.019
{\an8}Uh-oh, look who we got
coming over here.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.854
(overlapping greetings)

10:04.937 --> 10:05.855
{\an3}Hey.

10:04.937 --> 10:05.855
{\an1}What's up?

10:05.938 --> 10:06.856
{\an1}Hi.

10:05.938 --> 10:06.856
What's going on?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.190
{\an5}You look cute.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.190
Thanks.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.442
{\an5}What's up, man?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.442
What's up, bro?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.193
(Chloe)
Hey, I loved the white tux

10:11.277 --> 10:13.195
{\an6}last night.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.195
Oh, yeah, thank you.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.032
{\an5}(Kelsey)
You want that team?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.032
You have fun last night?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.700
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.785
That party was crazy
last night.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.370
{\an5}Yeah. Yeah.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.370
I did not expect it

10:21.454 --> 10:23.497
{\an5}to be that big.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.497
Well, you guys have fun

10:23.581 --> 10:24.582
last night or...

10:23.581 --> 10:24.582
{\an1}Yeah.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.501
At the party?

10:27.585 --> 10:29.462
I know you had fun.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.714
{\an3}(laughing)

10:33.257 --> 10:37.261
I need a drink.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.555
{\an5}(Amanda)
So, what did you
want to talk about?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
Well, I don't know, like,

10:41.807 --> 10:44.393
{\an1}after our big talk
and everything,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.480
{\an1}we were like, it's gonna be
us girls this summer,

10:47.563 --> 10:49.190
{\an1}we're all gonna have each
other's back.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.275
{\an1}And I find out
you lied to me about Alex,

10:51.359 --> 10:53.903
{\an1}and that's why I got upset,
I didn't really...

10:53.986 --> 10:55.237
{\an1}I don't know.
Like, I thought

10:55.321 --> 10:57.365
{\an1}we were better friends
than that, and then,

10:57.448 --> 10:58.282
{\an1}you know,
seeing you last night,

10:58.366 --> 11:00.117
I thought you would,
like, come up to me

11:00.201 --> 11:01.535
{\an1}and give me, like,
the biggest hug,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.871
and it didn't feel like
our friendship before.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.748
Like it used to be.
I mean, you know me.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.666
{\an1}Like, when I walked in there,
I just wanted to go get a drink,

11:07.750 --> 11:10.544
and when I saw you,
I felt that tension.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.964
But I'm happy we talk
about this because...

11:14.048 --> 11:15.132
{\an4}Yeah.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.132
...we always figure it out.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.510
I don't know, like, I just
want you to know that I--

11:17.593 --> 11:18.260
{\an1}you know I love you
and you know I care about you.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.471
{\an1}Yeah.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.471
{\an3}But if--

11:20.554 --> 11:21.597
{\an5}we just need baby steps.

11:20.554 --> 11:21.597
Baby steps.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.934
{\an1}So let's just continue
to be good.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.185
{\an3}Yeah.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.144
(Brandon)
You told me last night,

11:27.228 --> 11:29.522
you said that you just
got out of school.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.607
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
I just graduated.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.402
{\an8}What'd you study?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.402
{\an8}Engineering.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.361
{\an8}Whoa, smart,
so, you're like...

11:35.444 --> 11:37.655
{\an8}you got it up top.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.615
Well, I got math up top.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.659
{\an1}What would you say is,
like, the number-one reason

11:41.742 --> 11:44.328
why you got
into engineering?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.956
{\an1}When I was little, I just had
a fascination with bridges.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.792
{\an8}Okay, so...

11:47.039 --> 11:49.792
{\an8}Yeah, so I just thought,

11:49.875 --> 11:51.127
you know, math and bridges...

11:51.210 --> 11:53.587
{\an5}Math and bridges.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.587
...equals engineering.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.966
So, did you grow up here?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.218
{\an1}I did.
I was born and raised here.

11:59.301 --> 11:59.927
{\an5}Oh, me too.

11:59.301 --> 11:59.927
For sure, and then I lived

12:00.010 --> 12:01.804
in New York
for three years.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.305
That's awesome.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.305
{\an3}Yeah.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.765
So, do you write
your own music?

12:04.849 --> 12:05.724
{\an3}Of course.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.724
{\an1}Yeah?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.143
{\an1}Do you play
any instruments?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.395
I'm learning the guitar
and the piano.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.229
{\an1}Really?

12:10.312 --> 12:11.856
What if I play
the piano for you?

12:11.939 --> 12:13.107
Um, that would be amazing.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.942
I'll do math equations...

12:15.025 --> 12:16.986
You do math.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.986
...and you sing.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.655
{\an1}I'll tell you what.
What if sometime soon,

12:19.738 --> 12:20.948
{\an1}if just you and me
went out...

12:21.031 --> 12:22.158
{\an1}Yeah.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.158
...for, like, a date.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.160
{\an5}That sounds good.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.160
Talk a little more.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.120
'Cause I just don't
wanna burn any bridges

12:26.203 --> 12:27.496

{\an8}To the beach?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.190
{\an9}Yeah.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.026
{\an8}I don't know, Chloe, like,
called me and invited me,

12:57.109 --> 13:00.029
{\an7}but I'm not, like,
gonna pretend

13:00.112 --> 13:02.031
{\an7}that Alex and Amanda thing
didn't happen, you know?

13:02.114 --> 13:02.907
Yeah, good for you.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.367
It's just... I'm not
gonna let him, like,

13:05.451 --> 13:07.828
{\an1}get away with whatever he wants
and I'm not just gonna like--

13:07.912 --> 13:09.205
No, you're not gonna
be his Plan "B".

13:09.288 --> 13:10.956
Exactly, and I'm just...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.791
{\an1}I wouldn't talk to him at all,
I wouldn't text him at all.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.044
{\an5}I'm not going to.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.044
But I wouldn't
act like I cared,

13:15.127 --> 13:16.504
because then that
gives him...

13:16.587 --> 13:18.631
{\an1}I know, like, I feel like
the fact that I'm not there

13:18.714 --> 13:21.383
{\an4}almost makes it
seem like I care.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.383
{\an3}Yeah.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.136
{\an1}And I don't really care.
I mean, I care.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.721
You know what I mean.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.721
{\an3}Yeah.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.266
{\an1}You have lipstick
on this tooth.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.393
{\an3}Is it gone?

13:31.477 --> 13:35.231
It's, like, on your meat tooth.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.149
{\an6}Meat tooth?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.149
That's what I call it.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.777
Do you think it looks
like I'm trying to be,

13:39.860 --> 13:41.612
{\an5}like, petty by not going
to the beach day today?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.612
{\an3}No. No.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.322
{\an1}Everyone's there but me.
I just--

13:43.405 --> 13:46.492
{\an5}I mean, who cares?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.492
{\an1}And I know we'll,
like, be friends again,

13:46.575 --> 13:48.077
{\an4}I can't really, like,
ignore him.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.077
{\an3}Yeah.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.453
{\an1}And, like, we're in
the same friend group.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.539
Like, I'm not just gonna...

13:51.622 --> 13:53.374
{\an1}I'm not gonna leave
the group.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.166
{\an3}Yeah.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.378
{\an1}Yeah.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.504
{\an3}Yeah.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.799
{\an5}I'm having more fun
here probably anyway.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.799
{\an1}Yeah.

14:01.882 --> 14:02.174
I don't like sand.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.385
Yeah.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.803
{\an1}Last night was so good.
It was amazing.

14:05.886 --> 14:09.515
{\an5}(Chloe)
Wait, where's Kelsey
and Garrett?

14:25.030 --> 14:28.200
{\an1}I feel like we weren't able
to talk about, like, last night

14:28.284 --> 14:29.785
and then I, like,
left early and...

14:29.868 --> 14:31.537
{\an1}Yeah, you seemed
pretty angry.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.581
{\an1}The whole night, I just felt
like you kept leaving me,

14:33.664 --> 14:36.375
like, kinda by myself.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.502
Like, I barely saw you.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.754
You guys, Garrett left
last night all upset.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.797
Yeah, I wonder why.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.632
{\an1}She just says that
they've been arguing

14:43.716 --> 14:45.968
a little bit more
than normal.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.344
{\an1}I think you throw
Alex in the mix

14:47.428 --> 14:49.638
{\an1}and you got a deadly
combination there.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.724
{\an1}(Alex)
What are you talking about?

14:51.807 --> 14:53.350
And then being at a party

14:53.434 --> 14:54.351
where I'm not really
seeing my girlfriend,

14:54.435 --> 14:57.855
she's off, like, talking
to, like, other guys.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.566
{\an4}Like, Alex pulled you aside
to have a conversation.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.566
I pulled him aside.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.653
{\an1}I was talking
to him about his speech.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.739
{\an1}I think you're reading
into things more.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.240
{\an3}I'm not.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.284
What do you want me
to do, mope around?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.119
You were there
pretty late, right?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.415
{\an1}What happened in
the hot tub last night?

15:16.498 --> 15:19.668
Alex, did something go down
with you and Kelsey or what?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.420
{\an5}Yeah, what was up with that?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.420
(Alex)
A couple of drinks,

15:21.503 --> 15:23.172
that's the only thing
that really went down.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.883
{\an4}Clearly.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.883
(Pauly)
Wink.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.427
If, like, you really cared,
I feel like you would have

15:28.510 --> 15:32.014
at least, like, gave me
a call or something.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.307
I didn't have my--
I was in the pool,

15:33.390 --> 15:34.850
{\an1}I couldn't text you
or call you then.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.353
You were having
a good time without me.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.732
{\an1}I think Alex could take her
in a heartbeat if he wanted to

15:41.815 --> 15:43.817
{\an4}and Garrett's not doing
anything about it.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.817
(Chloe)
Yeah.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.362
{\an5}And if you really love
your girl, you won't
allow that to happen.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.156
{\an5}I think he does
really love her.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.156
He's allowing Alex

15:49.239 --> 15:50.824
{\an5}to get close with his girl.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.824
I don't think he's
allowing it, I think--

15:50.908 --> 15:52.868
{\an4}(Alex)
What do you mean "allowing"?

15:50.908 --> 15:52.868
What can he do?

15:52.951 --> 15:54.370
{\an1}He's not doing
anything about it.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.372
He's a sweet guy and if he--
if she doesn't want

15:56.455 --> 15:58.707
to be with him, I don't
think he's gonna fight that.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.377
{\an1}So, what do you want me to do
so we can figure this out.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.545
I don't know.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.632
I'm not gonna tell you,
like, what to do.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.385
That's not up to me,
that's-- that's you.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.969
What can he do?
What can he do?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.262
He's not a fighter.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.139
Why isn't he fighting
for his relationship?

16:14.223 --> 16:16.308
{\an1}He's not a fighter.
He's gonna lose his girl.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.852
Well, I'm sorry.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.729

gone different last night.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.334
Hopefully there's
no hard feelings.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.127
{\an6}Who cares?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.127
{\an1}That's what
I'm saying, exactly.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.046
{\an6}Who cares?

21:35.210 --> 21:38.046
I'm in the same boat.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.381
{\an5}He can handle it.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.381
He can handle it, right?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.549
{\an3}Yeah.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.216
{\an1}So tell me more about you.
I haven't really--

21:41.299 --> 21:43.885
You have, like, any siblings?

21:43.969 --> 21:44.970
{\an5}Yes, three older sisters.

21:43.969 --> 21:44.970
Three older sisters.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.889
{\an6}Yeah.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.889
{\an1}You guys are all,
like, Pine View alumni.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.266
Yeah, we all went
to Pine View.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.726
I went to Riverview.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.477
{\an1}And I went to school
in New York.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.187
{\an6}Yeah.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.187
For, like, two years there.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.190
{\an4}That was fun, I was--
there was a lot I did
in New York.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.777
{\an6}Yeah?

21:57.274 --> 22:00.777
{\an1}Everything as far as,
like, get my first apartment

22:00.861 --> 22:03.572
to having, like, a real job

22:03.655 --> 22:05.407
{\an1}and modeling on top of that
and acting.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.160
{\an5}Modeling in New York, whoa.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.160
Yeah, it was the real deal.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.037
{\an1}That's what you look like
right now, a model in New York.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.747
Oh, I don't--
I don't know about that.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.040
{\an1}No, right?
You really do, but...

22:13.123 --> 22:16.418
Amazing, I love it.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
{\an1}What else?

22:21.965 --> 22:24.092
{\an4}I know you said you have
three sisters.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.092
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.054
{\an1}What about your parents?
I haven't heard about them.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.264
So, my parents
are recently separated.

22:29.347 --> 22:30.682
So, they're in that stage.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.434
Not divorced yet.
What about you?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.519
Um, my parents
are divorced.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.855
I was in ninth grade.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.855
{\an3}Okay.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.356
So that makes us
similar in a way.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.028
Does that make you,
like, a cynic for love?

22:43.111 --> 22:44.237
{\an1}I've actually never
had a girlfriend.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.740
{\an6}Wow.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.740
Don't let that scare you.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.784
{\an5}I don't know.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.784
No, no, no, no, I was--

22:48.867 --> 22:51.161
{\an5}It's a bit intimidating.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.161
It's-- it's just,

22:51.244 --> 22:54.372
{\an1}I've always, like,
played the defensive part.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.833
{\an6}Yeah.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.833
{\an1}But that makes
you alone, you know?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.418
{\an1}So I don't wanna
be that way.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.836
{\an3}No.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.836
What about you?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.713
I've watched a few
Disney movies in my day.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.466
{\an4}The Prince Charming
movies and whatnot?
I understand, I understand.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.968
Yeah, and I think I'm
a sucker for fairy tales.

23:07.052 --> 23:12.474
♪ Then let me tell you
the memories make me ♪

23:12.557 --> 23:15.102
{\an8}♪ I feel a rush ♪

23:15.185 --> 23:20.023

23:22.651 --> 23:25.153

23:22.651 --> 23:25.153
{\an1}Right?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.029
(both chuckle)

23:26.113 --> 23:27.781
(Madisson)
My first date with Brandon

23:27.864 --> 23:28.824
was a fairy tale beginning.

23:28.907 --> 23:33.328
I was just hoping
he wasn't too good to be true.

23:37.874 --> 23:41.878
♪♪

23:52.389 --> 23:55.267
{\an8}It's your turn, Dad.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.267
{\an8}Yeah, your turn.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.894
{\an8}Mmm... a gift.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.355
{\an8}Ooh!

23:57.978 --> 24:00.355
{\an7}Oh, shoot.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.232
{\an8}If only I could use it.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.859
{\an8}I was actually thinking
of doing something,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.026
You know, now that
you've graduated,

24:05.110 --> 24:09.030
{\an5}you need to--
to be rewarded
with a nice dinner.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.157
{\an5}Thank you.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.157
I've got to--

24:10.240 --> 24:12.826
{\an5}So let me know
what the guest list
is, we'll...

24:12.909 --> 24:14.202
I definitely
want to invite Alex.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.288
Um, and I have
this new friend Kelsey,

24:16.371 --> 24:20.333
and then possibly
this boy Brandon.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.252
{\an5}Hmm. Uh-huh.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.252
(Madisson laughs)

24:22.335 --> 24:23.295
{\an3}Brandon?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.087
Yeah, he's a--
he's a new friend.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.380
Will I like him?

24:25.463 --> 24:27.924
I think so.
He's very polite.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.050
Does he like music?

24:29.134 --> 24:30.343
As long as he's polite.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.803
Oh, he is very,
very musically talented.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.889
Does he like
old school music?

24:33.972 --> 24:35.182
I don't know.
We'll have to find out.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.726
Well, that sounds good.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.478
And, you know, your mom?

24:40.562 --> 24:43.148
You can, uh, just
let her know, you know.

24:43.231 --> 24:43.773
{\an1}Yeah.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.029
(Garrett on phone)
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

24:49.112 --> 24:50.113
<i>You should come by</i>
<i>after work.</i>

24:50.197 --> 24:53.158
{\an8}<i>We need to talk.</i>

24:53.241 --> 24:54.910
{\an8}(Kelsey)
So what have you
been up to?

24:54.993 --> 24:58.079
{\an8}Yeah, um...

24:58.163 --> 25:02.584
{\an7}Not much.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.046
{\an1}I mean...

25:06.129 --> 25:08.840
{\an1}I'm honestly probably
gonna stay here

25:08.924 --> 25:13.094
{\an1}while you're
in the Bahamas.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.095
{\an3}Why?

25:14.179 --> 25:17.265
Um, I mean,

25:17.349 --> 25:20.685
{\an1}I have a lot I have to
do that's gonna benefit me.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.394
{\an5}But I just think
that things are
kind of weird right now.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.355
I wouldn't
be comfortable

25:23.438 --> 25:24.940
going on that trip
without you.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.191
I would be there--

25:26.274 --> 25:27.442
{\an1}But are you, like,
afraid that--

25:27.525 --> 25:28.693
{\an1}Like, you think
something's gonna happen?

25:28.777 --> 25:29.778
{\an1}'Cause that's all
up to you.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.112
Like, that's
your choice.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.072
No, I'm not, but I'm not
even gonna put myself

25:32.155 --> 25:33.990
in that situation
in the first place.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.617
{\an1}But it's sounding like
if you were in that position,

25:35.700 --> 25:37.285
{\an5}you'd allow it to happen.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.285
I mean, if I'm, like...

25:43.333 --> 25:45.085
{\an1}I'm not gonna lie,
like, even the other night,

25:45.168 --> 25:47.462
{\an5}like, I was kinda flirty
in the hot tub
and that's not--

25:47.545 --> 25:51.508
{\an5}I'm not trying to go
to the Bahamas and
jeopardize what we have.

25:51.591 --> 25:51.967
Who were you flirting with?

25:52.050 --> 25:55.053
{\an3}Alex.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.143
{\an1}That's not fair to me.
You should go.

26:02.227 --> 26:02.978
I was angry and you
told me to stay.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.105
Okay, well...

26:05.188 --> 26:06.231
And then you stormed out
for no reason.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.650
{\an1}Yeah, and, like, that's,
like, what a relationship is.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.653
Like, you have to, like,
talk about those things.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.571
And that's why I'm talking--

26:13.655 --> 26:15.407
{\an4}And, like, you don't, like,
flirt with another guy.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.407
I'm not, but, like...

26:15.490 --> 26:16.783
{\an1}You, like, talk to
the guy that you're with.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.618
And that's why I'm trying
to be honest with you.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.370
Yeah, and I understand that,
but at the same time, like,

26:20.453 --> 26:21.913
{\an4}I can't have a girlfriend
that's gonna flirt
with another guy

26:21.997 --> 26:23.665
{\an1}that, typically,
that I don't even know

26:23.748 --> 26:26.084
{\an4}and really I don't like
because I've heard
things about him.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.550
I don't know.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.593
{\an1}I want to be able to
trust you, but--

26:35.677 --> 26:38.013
You can trust me,
I've been nothing but--

26:38.096 --> 26:38.847
The fact I'm even
telling you that--

26:38.930 --> 26:41.057
No girl would
tell her boyfriend,

26:41.141 --> 26:42.475
"I was flirting
with another guy."

26:42.559 --> 26:44.686
{\an1}A real girlfriend wouldn't
flirt with another guy.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.984
I didn't do anything.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.569
{\an1}You flirted
with another guy.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.987
We're in a relationship.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.156
{\an1}I don't think
that's allowed.

26:58.199 --> 27:02.162
{\an1}Stuff like that just makes me
look at you differently.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.999
{\an1}Especially, like,
what I've done to be,

27:06.082 --> 27:08.543

Hey, girl.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.000
{\an3}Oh, my God.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.585
Oh, you look beautiful.

29:13.668 --> 29:14.502
I think you've grown
another ten feet.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.172
{\an8}We're making
your favorite salad.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.423

29:17.255 --> 29:18.423
{\an9}Yeah.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.884

obviously.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.344
{\an3}Yeah?

29:23.428 --> 29:24.637
Speaking of, Dad is hosting

{\an1}Oh, yeah.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.904
{\an1}Your father and I,
we go in waves.

29:40.987 --> 29:44.365
{\an1}I happen to be on one
of those crashing waves

29:44.449 --> 29:47.118
that aren't friendly.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.453
I mean, it's hard.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.829
It's hard for us, too,
it really is.

29:49.913 --> 29:50.955
No, I just don't--

29:51.039 --> 29:51.706
{\an1}You know, I mean,
I think that would be fun,

29:51.789 --> 29:53.833
{\an1}but I think
it would be hard.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.376
That's okay, Mom.

29:55.460 --> 30:00.131
{\an1}You know, I just kinda
have to relearn who I am.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.382
{\an3}Yeah.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.509
{\an1}Yeah.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.509
{\an3}Yeah.

30:02.592 --> 30:06.387
Because we lived our lives
through you guys, you know,

30:06.471 --> 30:09.390
{\an1}for so many years,
and then, when, you know,

30:09.474 --> 30:12.393
{\an1}the last one leaves,
it's kinda like...

30:12.477 --> 30:14.395
What do we do?

30:12.477 --> 30:14.395
{\an3}Yeah.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.648
You'll know someday.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.274
{\an1}You'll know
what it's like.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.402
So, anyway...

30:21.486 --> 30:22.820
{\an1}I would like to hear what's
going on in your life.

30:22.904 --> 30:27.367
Um, I went on a date
with this guy Brandon.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.536
{\an1}Yeah.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.536
He models, he acts.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.079
He's very,
very musical.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.205
Well, good.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.957
{\an1}You have to keep me
informed, please.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.250
Oh, of course.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.042
{\an1}Well, you say of course,
but that doesn't--

30:36.125 --> 30:37.710
{\an1}"Of course" doesn't
mean anything.

{\an1}I mean, I don't know.

{\an8}Me and Garrett,
we're on a break.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.210
{\an7}What?
Seriously?

32:42.293 --> 32:43.503

I'm not great.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.842
{\an3}Sorry.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.220
So, I told you how, like,
he left the other night,

32:52.303 --> 32:56.516
{\an5}and in all honesty,
like, me and Alex were,
like, semi-flirting,

32:56.599 --> 32:58.434
and I told Garrett that,

32:58.518 --> 33:01.145
{\an1}and that really,
like, made him angry.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.231
{\an5}Well, did you just
drop this bomb on him,
or do you think--

33:03.314 --> 33:03.898
{\an1}No!

33:03.981 --> 33:05.817
Do you think he's known

33:05.900 --> 33:07.610
that you've
been struggling?

33:07.694 --> 33:10.530
{\an1}Yes, I think I have been,
but I also think

33:10.613 --> 33:12.323
{\an1}everything was going
good between us,

33:12.407 --> 33:13.491
I didn't want it
to seem that way.

33:13.574 --> 33:14.909
Well, everything
was going good

33:14.992 --> 33:17.453
superficially between
you and Garrett.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.122
{\an1}Yeah.

33:19.205 --> 33:23.084
{\an5}But you felt
that everything
that you wanted

33:23.167 --> 33:24.293
wasn't completely there.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.712
{\an1}And that's why
I needed this break.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.422
{\an1}This is why I shouldn't
be in a relationship.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.464
{\an1}That's why I need to
figure my (bleep) out.

33:28.548 --> 33:32.427
{\an4}I feel like, yes,
me and Alex have
a connection,

33:32.510 --> 33:34.178
but I don't want to
ever hurt Garrett.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.847
I know you love him,
I know you respect him,

33:35.930 --> 33:39.892
but you've got
to live for you.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.019
{\an1}Stop, you're
gonna make me cry!

33:42.103 --> 33:44.605
Well, I'm just saying
that, I mean,

33:44.689 --> 33:47.650
you were very good to him,
and you care a lot,

33:47.734 --> 33:49.277
and you're a good girl.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.988
{\an1}But you just have got to
step back and find yourself

when you came to the house

35:18.115 --> 35:20.660
{\an7}and you were
tutoring Alex...

{\an8}(laughing)
Tutoring Alex.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.083
{\an1}And I saw this beautiful girl
walk up my staircase,

35:27.166 --> 35:31.045
{\an1}I'm like, wow,
now he's got the tutor.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.713

35:50.147 --> 35:52.900

graduating from college,

35:52.984 --> 35:56.863

walking her
to kindergarten,

35:58.155 --> 36:02.785
um, teaching her
to ride a bike.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.746
