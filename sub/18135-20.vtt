PENGUIN: That's right,
I set up the heist

00:27.160 --> 00:29.528
but Two-Face took the cash.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.129
A half million.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.799
No one makes a patsy
out of Penguin!

00:33.834 --> 00:38.003
Unless they like the view
from a pair of cement boots.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.604
<i>I want my cash back.</i>

00:39.639 --> 00:43.608
Which means you gotta bring me
Two-Face alive.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.278
<i>Though he doesn't have to be</i>
<i>in the best of shape.</i>

00:46.313 --> 00:48.080
It could be tricky.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.682
Batman's got him
with the police.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.352
<i>I hope you're up</i>
<i>to the job, Floyd.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:57.556
Don't worry.
I'll get you Two-Face.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.227
And the name's Deadshot.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.702
(TWO-FACE GRUNTING)

01:13.440 --> 01:15.340
Do you really have to do that?
Quiet.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.577
It's just really annoying
when you... Quiet!

01:18.612 --> 01:20.712
I'm trying to get us out
of these high-tech bracelets.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.048
Try a hairpin.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.316
You got a hairpin?

01:24.351 --> 01:26.118
Why would I have a hairpin?

01:26.153 --> 01:27.453
Well, then, quiet!

01:30.824 --> 01:31.824
Do it.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.564
(GRUNTS)

01:39.599 --> 01:43.102
Would you please hold still!

01:44.871 --> 01:48.740
Just a few more scars and...

01:48.775 --> 01:50.843
You think this guy's
gonna fool Deadshot?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.345
He'd better.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.747
I've wanted that sharpshooter
behind bars for years.

01:56.516 --> 01:57.549
<i>Voila!</i>

01:57.584 --> 01:58.851
Eh? Uh-huh?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.186
It's sloppy.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.321
Two-Face wears
his pocket square on the left,
not the right.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.624
His cufflinks are silver,
not gold.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.760
And you have his scarred
and normal sides reversed.

02:08.795 --> 02:13.064
Gee, Bats, I only learned
to do colors a week ago.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.167
Just a switcheroo and...

02:15.202 --> 02:19.238
I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. Spielberg.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.174
Ooh, missed a spot.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.044
Here. And no funny stuff.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.446
<i>Moi?</i>

02:30.217 --> 02:31.850
Awesome!

02:31.885 --> 02:32.984
What about me?

02:33.019 --> 02:34.353
You stay with him.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.524
He should have said, "them."

02:39.559 --> 02:41.893
What do you care,
you pasty-faced pretty boy?

02:41.928 --> 02:44.796
What do I care?
I can't be confused with you.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.799
You're a soulless criminal
and professional thief.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.034
Whereas I'm a lawyer.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.337
I guess we got more in common
than I thought.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.673
Geez. Imagine being stuck
in the same brainpan

02:54.708 --> 02:57.409
with a little
dum-dum-dum-dum-dum,
like that dude.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.445
Hmm.

PLASTIC MAN: Let me just
say what a privilege it is
working with you, sir.

03:04.451 --> 03:09.788
If my poor, gray-haired momma
back in Ashtabula
could see me now...

03:09.823 --> 03:11.289
Just stay in character.

03:11.324 --> 03:14.226
What makes you think
Deadshot's gonna try
anything tonight?

03:14.261 --> 03:18.230
I put word on the street
that I was driving Two-Face
to Arkham.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.699
Trust me.
He's out there somewhere.

04:13.853 --> 04:14.853
He wants you alive.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.289

of showing it.

Next time, can we pick
a safe house with cable?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.601
We've been glued
to that documentary

04:29.636 --> 04:32.337
about the societal hierarchy
of the red ant.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.639
-It's compelling.
-(GROANS)

04:34.674 --> 04:38.710
Nobody told me being a hero
would be so boring.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.814
Why not get a jump
on your chemistry homework?

04:42.849 --> 04:45.950
I, uh, already did it, yeah,
totally done, <i> finito.</i>

04:45.985 --> 04:49.521
Ronald Raymond,
you can't lie to me.
We share the same brain.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.324

the NSA for a roommate.

-I heard that.
-I know you heard that!

HARVEY DENT:
Listen to me, Harvey.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.561
Maybe you can make a deal.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.697
All you have to do
is give up the money.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.032
Forget it!
And don't call me Harvey.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.968
But I'm your good side.
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

05:04.003 --> 05:07.773
(SCOFFS) You'd sell me
to Sing Sing for a song.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.941
Hey, slick.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.509
Could you open a window?

05:11.544 --> 05:14.913
Your head's making it
all smoky in here.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.415
Yeah, no problem.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.118
Don't listen to him.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.287
Quiet! Shut your trap.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.521
He can't be trusted.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.989
One more word out of you,

05:25.024 --> 05:28.427
and I'll turn your face
into a bowl of macaroni!

It'll keep you nice and calm
until we get to Penguin.

But I just had a nap.

on your own.
