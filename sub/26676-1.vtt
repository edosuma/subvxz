00:53.915 --> 00:56.677
- There's my favorite
police officer.

00:56.677 --> 00:59.266
Would you like to
stay for breakfast?

00:59.266 --> 01:00.163
- Are you kidding me?

01:00.163 --> 01:00.957
Absolutely.

01:02.269 --> 01:03.925
- What are you doing?

01:03.925 --> 01:05.340
Let's go!

01:05.340 --> 01:07.032
- Yeah, hang on a second.

01:07.032 --> 01:08.206
- McDick,
get your ass outside.

01:08.206 --> 01:11.105
- I know, I'm upstairs,
I'll be right down.

01:11.105 --> 01:11.968
What?

01:13.521 --> 01:14.350
Hello?

01:15.523 --> 01:16.593
Question for you:

01:17.767 --> 01:19.941
Does somebody like
to drink and drive?

01:19.941 --> 01:20.873
I don't think so.

01:22.496 --> 01:24.118
Congratulations.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.740
You are officially off the hook.

01:27.742 --> 01:29.503
Does that make you happy?

01:29.503 --> 01:30.504
- Yeah.

01:30.504 --> 01:31.919
- You should not
drink and drive.

01:33.231 --> 01:36.441
However, if you've
got no choice,

01:36.441 --> 01:38.684
it's the weekend, your
friends are around,

01:38.684 --> 01:39.754
and you gotta get drunk,

01:39.754 --> 01:40.997
do it in my neighborhood.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.519
That sound like a deal?

01:45.519 --> 01:46.968
- Yeah.

01:46.968 --> 01:48.556
- That's what I like to hear.

01:48.556 --> 01:49.385
Come here.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.079
- God damn it, McDick.

01:54.079 --> 01:55.253
- What?

01:55.253 --> 01:56.944
- Let's go!

01:56.944 --> 01:59.740
- Yeah, you just said
that a minute ago.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.431
- McDick,
I swear to God...

02:02.398 --> 02:03.399
- Hey listen,

02:03.399 --> 02:04.952
you know what?

02:04.952 --> 02:06.402
I think maybe I'll go to the
bathroom before I come down.

02:06.402 --> 02:08.024
- McDick,
get your ass outside.

02:08.024 --> 02:09.888
- Okay,
yeah, here I come.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.418
- It's about time, Romeo.

02:22.418 --> 02:23.522
- Gimmie a break.

02:23.522 --> 02:25.006
What's your problem?

02:25.006 --> 02:26.629
- McDick, you better yank
your head outta your ass, man.

02:26.629 --> 02:27.561
- What's in your ass?

02:27.561 --> 02:28.872
- We gotta go, man.

02:28.872 --> 02:29.977
- I forgot to tell
you something else.

02:29.977 --> 02:31.254
- What's that?

02:38.606 --> 02:40.539
- Hang on, let's
run this car here.

02:40.539 --> 02:42.162
My guts tell me this is our guy.

02:43.301 --> 02:46.890
License plate Henry one
four Edgar seven five.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.309
- School
teacher no record.

02:52.379 --> 02:53.656
- You sure about that?

02:53.656 --> 02:55.451
- Yes,
McDick, I'm sure.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.732
- Where you goin'?

03:00.732 --> 03:02.251
- There's hostages up there.

03:02.251 --> 03:03.700
- Let's just wait for backup.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.702
- There's no time,
there's gun's reported.

03:06.565 --> 03:08.049
- What am I gonna do?

03:08.049 --> 03:09.258
Go up there and risk my
life just to save somebody?

03:09.258 --> 03:09.948
- Yeah, that's right,
McDick, that's your job.

03:09.948 --> 03:10.811
C'mon, let's go.

03:11.674 --> 03:13.296
- I'll tell you what.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.367
We'll call the captain,
tell him we checked it out,

03:15.367 --> 03:16.610
everything was fine.

03:16.610 --> 03:17.438
Prank call.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.992
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.787
- It's 10 in the morning.

03:30.486 --> 03:31.797
- Gunshots are that way.

03:34.283 --> 03:36.492
- Excuse me, ma'am,
listen, it's alright.

03:36.492 --> 03:37.355
We're here to protect you.

03:37.355 --> 03:38.977
We're policemen.

03:38.977 --> 03:40.358
- Ma'am, return to your apartment
and lock the door, please.

03:40.358 --> 03:41.911
- Hang on a second, whoa whoa.

03:41.911 --> 03:43.395
Why don't you go ahead and
just check it out down there,

03:43.395 --> 03:44.327
I'm gonna stay here with her.

03:44.327 --> 03:45.328
Can I stay here with you?

03:47.917 --> 03:49.194
Excuse me.

03:49.194 --> 03:50.713
Ma'am, ma'am, listen.

03:50.713 --> 03:53.336
I'll stay here with you and
just make sure that you're safe.

03:53.336 --> 03:55.165
- It's
okay, I'm alright.

03:55.165 --> 03:56.166
- Really?

03:56.166 --> 03:57.547
- I'm good.

03:57.547 --> 03:59.204
- Ow, ow, okay, okay.

03:59.204 --> 04:00.895
Would you let go
of my foot please?

04:04.589 --> 04:06.211
Hey why are you walkin' so fast?

04:12.355 --> 04:14.012
I think we're on
the wrong floor.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.843
- Please don't hurt me.

04:17.843 --> 04:19.603
Please don't hurt me.

04:32.893 --> 04:34.101
- Hey, McDick.

04:36.172 --> 04:39.037
I got a pretty nasty paper
cut here on my thumb.

04:39.037 --> 04:42.523
I'd show you but you might
pass out and get me shot.

04:43.938 --> 04:47.114
- Tell me something, did
you just get a haircut?

04:47.114 --> 04:48.702
- McDick!

04:51.118 --> 04:53.258
- How you doin' Captain?

04:53.258 --> 04:55.329
- Internal Affairs needs to
speak with you immediately

04:55.329 --> 04:56.917
when you are
finished over there,

04:56.917 --> 04:59.851
you are to come
directly to my office.

04:59.851 --> 05:01.473
- You seem really
tense right now.

05:01.473 --> 05:02.992
What's goin' on?

05:02.992 --> 05:04.511
- Get your hand off my arm.

05:04.511 --> 05:06.823
- You haven't
answered my question.

05:06.823 --> 05:07.652
- I.A.

05:09.861 --> 05:10.724
- Okay.
- Now!

05:11.587 --> 05:12.484
- I'm sorry, what?

05:15.487 --> 05:16.454
- Officer McDick,

05:17.834 --> 05:19.491
we need you to go on
record and tell us exactly

05:19.491 --> 05:21.666
what happened out there today.

05:21.666 --> 05:22.598
- Oh, right now?

05:22.598 --> 05:23.426
- Right now.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.256
- Okay.

05:26.256 --> 05:30.571
Well, we got a call for
a domestic disturbance.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.159
Violent in nature.

05:32.159 --> 05:34.748
I think they said a
gunshot was reported.

05:34.748 --> 05:39.028
And so we arrived at
the scene and Conroy,

05:39.028 --> 05:42.549
my partner, was just kinda
freezin' up a little bit,

05:42.549 --> 05:45.241
he seemed nervous, kinda
out of character for him.

05:45.241 --> 05:47.519
I said, look man,
we're cops, okay?

05:47.519 --> 05:48.727
This is our responsibility,

05:48.727 --> 05:51.040
let's get up there
and just handle this.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.524
Hell, I'll be the point man.

05:52.524 --> 05:56.321
And off the record, he suggest
that we go and get a drink.

05:57.495 --> 05:59.911
Call the captain, tell
him everything's fine,

05:59.911 --> 06:01.602
let's go grab a beer.

06:01.602 --> 06:02.534
I said, "Are you kiddin' me?

06:02.534 --> 06:03.742
"Let's get upstairs right now."

06:03.742 --> 06:06.366
So we're upstairs,
we're outside this door,

06:07.574 --> 06:09.127
I was pretty sure
I heard a gunshot,

06:09.127 --> 06:11.612
and then I think it had to
have been a baseball bat.

06:11.612 --> 06:14.201
Somebody just slams me
in the back of the head.

06:14.201 --> 06:16.893
Next thing I know, I black out,

06:16.893 --> 06:20.138
and then like,

06:20.138 --> 06:21.760
it was like weird for a minute,

06:21.760 --> 06:25.419
and then I come to and there's
just a bunch of cops around.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.869
People start asking
me questions,

06:26.869 --> 06:30.286
I'm not really even sure
where I am and now we're here.

06:30.286 --> 06:32.392
- There were large
quantities of unmarked bills

06:32.392 --> 06:33.634
at the scene.

06:33.634 --> 06:36.361
You have any idea why
Etson left without it?

06:36.361 --> 06:37.569
- How should I know, guys?

06:37.569 --> 06:39.571
- It's
your job, McDick.

06:39.571 --> 06:40.779
- Do you know this girl?

06:41.884 --> 06:44.058
- That looks like a woman to me.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.509
But no, who is she?

06:46.509 --> 06:49.236
- Molten Lava is
a former stripper

06:49.236 --> 06:52.895
slash criminal defense
attorney and now a crime lord.

06:52.895 --> 06:56.381
Recently Miss Lava has
become more aggressive

06:56.381 --> 07:00.178
and is looking to expand
her territory considerably.

07:00.178 --> 07:01.731
We believe she'll
stop at nothing.

07:01.731 --> 07:05.770
You're to contact my office
if her name ever comes up.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.806
Doesn't matter what context.

07:07.806 --> 07:10.015
- Okay, so let's just
back up a second here.

07:10.913 --> 07:12.432
She used to be a stripper?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.433
You guys have any photographs

07:13.433 --> 07:15.676
from that period in her career?

07:15.676 --> 07:16.505
- Done here.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.267
- Come on, guys, it's
just a couple pictures.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.579
Where you goin'?

07:27.895 --> 07:31.658
- Were you in the ladies
room this morning?

07:32.831 --> 07:34.350
- Why would you ask
me that question?

07:34.350 --> 07:37.318
- I guess because three
of your female colleagues

07:37.318 --> 07:42.013
claim that they caught you
peeking under their stall doors.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.497
That's why.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.499
- I would like to speak
to my attorney right now.

07:45.499 --> 07:49.572
- You are not going to
speak to anyone right now.

07:51.229 --> 07:52.679
You know what I got here?

07:52.679 --> 07:53.611
- No.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.267
- Your psychiatric report.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.614
- Well, that's confidential.

07:56.614 --> 07:58.616
- The precinct shrink asked you

07:59.789 --> 08:01.964
what your three
biggest fears were

08:03.275 --> 08:04.484
when it came to the job.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.864
Do you remember
what you told her?

08:05.864 --> 08:07.763
- I do not recall.

08:07.763 --> 08:10.731
- Your biggest
fear about the job

08:13.285 --> 08:16.806
was that you are going
to get eaten by a whale.

08:16.806 --> 08:18.912
- Yeah, I don't wanna
be eaten by a whale.

08:20.396 --> 08:21.846
Are you really gonna
sit here and tell me

08:21.846 --> 08:23.951
you'd have no problem
swimming in the same part

08:23.951 --> 08:25.297
of the ocean as a whale?

08:25.297 --> 08:26.506
Honestly?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.679
- I think I might
sit here and tell you

08:27.679 --> 08:29.578
whatever I God damn want to!

08:30.889 --> 08:33.582
Your second biggest
fear about the job

08:33.582 --> 08:36.654
that someone might set
your penis on fire.

08:36.654 --> 08:39.484
- Captain, where you
goin' with this stuff?

08:39.484 --> 08:42.107
- You have got to be, yeah,

08:42.107 --> 08:44.558
the worst cop

08:44.558 --> 08:47.216
I have ever encountered

08:47.216 --> 08:49.736
in my 19 years of service.

08:49.736 --> 08:51.116
- I know you don't mean that.

08:51.116 --> 08:54.326
- You're now-dead
ex-partner made a statement

08:54.326 --> 08:59.331
before he died that completely
contradicts yours, McDick.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.540
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.920
And call me crazy, but

09:01.920 --> 09:03.128
I believe the dead guy.

09:03.128 --> 09:05.855
You know that private
detective business

09:05.855 --> 09:08.030
that you've been
talking about starting?

09:08.030 --> 09:09.031
- Yeah.

09:09.031 --> 09:10.791
- I think now's the time.

09:10.791 --> 09:11.620
- For?

09:11.620 --> 09:12.759
- You're fired.

09:14.726 --> 09:15.658
- What do you mean?

09:16.797 --> 09:21.250
♪ You keep your distance,
I'll keep mine ♪

09:31.191 --> 09:33.642
♪ Away, away now

♪ You keep your distance,

10:15.615 --> 10:20.136
- If you continue
to disrespect me,

10:20.136 --> 10:22.622
and by that I mean not
returning my phone calls,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.727
not showing up on time,

10:24.727 --> 10:27.454
you're gonna put me in a position
where I've got no choice

10:27.454 --> 10:29.352
but to fire you.

10:29.352 --> 10:31.285
- I was at soccer practice.

10:31.285 --> 10:35.013
- I was a soccer practice.

10:35.013 --> 10:36.256
What does that even mean?

10:39.984 --> 10:41.951
Are you still on top
of that gun situation?

10:43.125 --> 10:44.574
Are we still on for
lunch next week?

10:44.574 --> 10:47.025
- Yes, sure, why not?

10:47.025 --> 10:48.199
- Alright.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.407
I think that's about it.

10:52.065 --> 10:52.893
Jesus Christ.

10:59.244 --> 11:00.452
- Okay, I'm impressed.

11:01.315 --> 11:02.627
- Mister Robertson is here.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.216
- Which one's Mister Robertson?

11:05.216 --> 11:07.667
- He's the one that wanted to
talk to you about his wife.

11:09.082 --> 11:11.360
- That the little Asian
guy with the blonde hair?

11:11.360 --> 11:14.397
- No, the medium sized guy with
the brown-ish gray-ish hair.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.574
- Come on, Melanie, that
doesn't mean anything to me.

11:18.574 --> 11:19.782
- He's the one that
suspected his wife

11:19.782 --> 11:21.335
of being a high end prostitute.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.268
- That guy?

11:25.098 --> 11:26.616
Yeah, you better bring him in.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.553
- You can come in now, sir.

11:37.144 --> 11:38.628
- Well, mister
Robertson, I must say

11:38.628 --> 11:40.941
that this is my least
favorite part of the job.

11:40.941 --> 11:43.219
I'm afraid I have confirmed
your worst suspicions

11:43.219 --> 11:45.014
and that your wife has, in fact,

11:45.014 --> 11:47.189
been moonlighting as
a high end prostitute.

11:50.123 --> 11:51.193
Sorry, take a minute.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.991
There's nothing in the world
that one of these can't fix.

12:13.077 --> 12:14.319
- How are you able
to confirm this?

12:14.319 --> 12:15.562
Do you have pictures of

12:16.943 --> 12:17.771
that whore?

12:18.910 --> 12:19.739
- No.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.016
Pictures? No.

12:21.016 --> 12:22.672
- So then you saw
her with someone?

12:23.846 --> 12:26.228
- No, when I spoke with
her, she was by herself.

12:26.228 --> 12:28.126
- You actually
spoke with my wife?

12:28.126 --> 12:30.197
- Yeah, I told her that
I wanted to pay her

12:30.197 --> 12:31.889
to have sex with me and she did.

12:34.305 --> 12:36.514
- You had sex with my wife?

12:36.514 --> 12:37.757
- Well, yeah.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.068
I mean, there's only one
way to find out for real

12:39.068 --> 12:41.450
if she's a prostitute, right?

12:41.450 --> 12:42.934
So...

12:42.934 --> 12:46.558
By the way, she's a fairly
difficult negotiator.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.321
You're gonna find here on
your invoice a fee of $600

12:50.321 --> 12:52.081
for services received.

12:53.117 --> 12:53.945
Ow!

13:03.092 --> 13:04.507
- Where are you?

13:04.507 --> 13:05.854
- Behind my desk.

13:08.995 --> 13:11.411
Guy just punched me in the face.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.861
Is that a knife?

13:12.861 --> 13:14.207
- It's a letter opener.

13:14.207 --> 13:15.933
I thought he was
trying to hurt you.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.073
- He was trying to
hurt me and it worked.

13:18.073 --> 13:19.764
Put the knife down
I hate knives.

13:22.422 --> 13:24.182
Could you check my pulse please?

13:28.738 --> 13:29.774
How is it?

13:29.774 --> 13:30.706
- I don't know.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.087
I think it's about the same.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.229
- Could you get me a
cup of coffee, please?

13:36.229 --> 13:38.576
Just get me a cup of coffee.

13:54.903 --> 13:56.525
- Hey, boss.

13:56.525 --> 13:59.562
He's a private detective now.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.633
The business seems
to be failing.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.499
Not much client volume, no
suspect financial expenditures,

14:05.499 --> 14:08.295
and no indication of where he
might be holding any of it.

14:08.295 --> 14:11.505
I'd approach him but
the whole cop thing.

14:11.505 --> 14:12.334
- Former cop.

14:13.783 --> 14:14.923
It's a huge difference.

14:16.407 --> 14:18.616
What did I say about giving
them to me backwards?

14:18.616 --> 14:19.548
What is this?

14:19.548 --> 14:21.205
Did you do that on purpose?

14:21.205 --> 14:24.760
Well, obviously this asshole
knows something that we don't

14:24.760 --> 14:25.692
'cause otherwise
he wouldn't have

14:25.692 --> 14:28.005
the balls to pull off this shit.

14:28.005 --> 14:29.869
Well, I hope he
knows what he's doing

14:31.008 --> 14:31.871
because I plan

14:33.182 --> 14:34.045
on pulling off

14:34.045 --> 14:35.702
his scrotum.

14:37.635 --> 14:38.878
Rub my hamstring.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.539
Who's a good ape?

14:47.645 --> 14:48.473
What good are you?

14:48.473 --> 14:49.302
Go back to your crib.

14:51.131 --> 14:52.029
Pick this shit up.

15:45.703 --> 15:47.049
- Someone was looking
for something.

15:47.049 --> 15:49.534
- Are we missin' anything?

15:49.534 --> 15:50.742
- Not that I could tell.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.366
- Alright, it's
probably just kids.

15:53.366 --> 15:54.608
- Yeah.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.679
Someone's waiting for
you in your office.

15:58.095 --> 15:58.958
- Really?

16:00.407 --> 16:01.719
Is it the dwarf?

16:02.616 --> 16:04.204
- No, a lady.

16:05.378 --> 16:06.206
- How old?

16:07.104 --> 16:07.967
- Um...

16:07.967 --> 16:08.795
- Doesn't matter.

16:16.078 --> 16:17.769
Oh, wow.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.944
- Excuse me for not
making an appointment.

16:19.944 --> 16:20.910
- Oh, my God!

16:20.910 --> 16:22.291
That's fine.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.913
Please have a seat.

16:23.913 --> 16:24.742
What's your name?

16:24.742 --> 16:25.674
- Virginia.

16:25.674 --> 16:28.711
- Virginia, okay.

16:28.711 --> 16:31.611
So tell me, how can
I save your day?

16:31.611 --> 16:34.269
- Well, I have a nephew who
I think might be getting

16:34.269 --> 16:35.925
mixed up with the wrong crowd.

16:35.925 --> 16:36.754
- Violent crowd?

16:36.754 --> 16:37.582
Dangerous?

16:37.582 --> 16:38.514
- No, no.

16:38.514 --> 16:40.413
My nephew is special.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.104
- Okay, so he's retarded.

16:42.104 --> 16:46.626
- Well, that's not what
we call it, but yes,

16:46.626 --> 16:50.009
and I feel like might be
doing frivolous things

16:50.009 --> 16:52.528
in order to impress
these children.

16:52.528 --> 16:55.704
- Frivolous as in violent,
gang-related type behavior?

16:55.704 --> 16:56.705
- No, no, no.

16:56.705 --> 16:59.984
He's not dangerous, just lost.

16:59.984 --> 17:01.503
- Okay, lost.

17:01.503 --> 17:04.161
And you want me to see what
he's up to every day, basically.

17:04.161 --> 17:06.196
- I can't watch
him 24 hours a day.

17:06.196 --> 17:07.128
His name is Morgan.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.650
- Okay, M-O-R-G-A-N?

17:10.650 --> 17:12.790
- You should know that he
is larger than kids his age

17:12.790 --> 17:14.377
and quite overweight.

17:14.377 --> 17:16.035
- Okay, so he's
fat and retarded.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.898
Retardant fat.

17:20.246 --> 17:23.455
Is he an especially
athletic fat kid?

17:23.455 --> 17:24.940
'Cause you know how
sometimes they can be...

17:24.940 --> 17:26.217
They look fat and they are fat

17:26.217 --> 17:28.185
but then they're
strong and fast.

17:28.185 --> 17:29.393
- Not that I know of.

17:29.393 --> 17:30.704
- Okay, short fuse,
temper problems?

17:30.704 --> 17:31.981
- No, he's very gentle.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.363
- Am I dealing with
a wildcard here?

17:34.363 --> 17:35.882
- Not that I know of.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.713
- Well, Virginia, today
is your lucky day,

17:39.713 --> 17:42.026
because McDick just came...

17:43.993 --> 17:44.822
To your rescue.

17:45.685 --> 17:46.513
- Oh, well thank you very much.

17:46.513 --> 17:48.205
- You're very welcome.

17:48.205 --> 17:50.621
And I have a brand
new tradition here

17:50.621 --> 17:53.417
where I like to give a good
luck hug to all my new clients

17:53.417 --> 17:55.419
so get up.

17:55.419 --> 17:57.076
- Okay.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.319
- That's right, come here.

17:59.319 --> 18:00.148
Oh, yeah.

18:00.148 --> 18:01.666
Okay, listen.

18:01.666 --> 18:04.773
I want you to know that I'm
going to get to the bottom

18:04.773 --> 18:05.946
of this for you.

18:05.946 --> 18:07.396
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.112
You sent me a bill.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.391
I haven't hired you in weeks.

18:36.391 --> 18:38.462
- How much money you
got in your pockets?

18:40.705 --> 18:42.776
- I don't have any
money in my pockets.

18:43.743 --> 18:44.571
- Empty 'em.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.367
- Seriously?

18:47.367 --> 18:48.299
Come on, man, am I gonna
lie to you about this?

18:48.299 --> 18:50.301
I have no money in my pockets.

18:50.301 --> 18:51.337
- The other one, too.

18:59.068 --> 19:01.726
- I swear I didn't
know that was in there.

19:01.726 --> 19:02.796
- Put it on the wall.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.144
- I can do that.

19:05.144 --> 19:05.972
- All of it.

19:13.048 --> 19:15.050
Somebody broke into
my office last week.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.846
I had to get my files back.

19:21.090 --> 19:23.541
- So I'm paying you
for trashing my office?

19:25.750 --> 19:26.717
- I was attacked.

19:27.718 --> 19:30.272
They think you robbed them.

19:31.963 --> 19:32.895
- Well who thinks that?

19:32.895 --> 19:33.793
What's his name?

19:35.553 --> 19:37.141
- I don't know, I
had to kill him.

19:40.558 --> 19:42.767
- You murdered
somebody in my office?

19:42.767 --> 19:45.287
- Hey, I'm a criminal
defense attorney.

19:45.287 --> 19:47.807
People can't be
breakin' into my office.

19:47.807 --> 19:48.808
- No, of course not.

19:50.672 --> 19:54.676
So I have a lawyer that
breaks into my office

19:54.676 --> 19:55.642
and kills people.

19:57.057 --> 19:58.197
Great.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.544
- Your house is
probably bein' watched.

20:00.544 --> 20:01.752
Do you have any clients?

20:03.547 --> 20:04.720
- Yes.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.205
I have one client.

20:07.102 --> 20:08.448
- Concentrate on your case.

20:09.415 --> 20:10.864
I'll find out who he is.

20:11.727 --> 20:12.556
Was.

20:15.938 --> 20:17.250
- Just for a cup of coffee.

20:37.374 --> 20:38.858
- Hey,
Melanie, it's McDick.

20:38.858 --> 20:41.757
Listen, I'm on my way to
that fat retarded kid's house

20:41.757 --> 20:43.725
just to follow up on that case,

20:43.725 --> 20:45.244
but I'm calling because
I haven't pooped in about

20:45.244 --> 20:48.419
two and a half days
and if you could have

20:48.419 --> 20:51.146
a nice big banana
smoothie waiting for me

20:51.146 --> 20:53.182
when I get back to the
office, that'd be perfect

20:53.182 --> 20:55.702
because bananas have
always helped me poop.

20:55.702 --> 20:58.049
And this is between us, okay?

20:58.049 --> 20:58.878
Thank you.

21:48.686 --> 21:49.791
- Awww, fuck.

22:11.502 --> 22:12.607
Run faster.

22:16.473 --> 22:17.646
- What?

22:17.646 --> 22:19.441
- You know how you
always bug me to drive?

22:19.441 --> 22:20.822
- I never bug you to drive.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.412
- Would you just get in the car?

22:24.412 --> 22:25.274
Give me the bag.

22:30.314 --> 22:31.453
Did you have a
nice day at school?

22:31.453 --> 22:32.316
- Fine.

23:01.034 --> 23:03.796
- Okay, I want you
to put these on.

23:07.247 --> 23:09.422
- I can't see in these.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.285
- That doesn't matter.

23:10.285 --> 23:11.113
Here.

23:11.113 --> 23:11.942
Put this on, too.

23:15.670 --> 23:17.844
Now, I want you

23:18.983 --> 23:20.502
to take my car

23:20.502 --> 23:22.608
and pull it right
into my driveway.

23:22.608 --> 23:23.436
Can you do that?

23:23.436 --> 23:25.058
- Where will you be?

23:25.058 --> 23:27.026
- I'm gonna be right
behind that tree.

23:27.026 --> 23:30.029
- Shouldn't we do this in an
empty parking lot or something?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.929
- I think you should trust
me now more than ever.

23:33.929 --> 23:34.861
Okay?

23:34.861 --> 23:36.173
No more questions like that.

23:36.173 --> 23:37.761
All you gotta do is
put the car in drive.

23:37.761 --> 23:40.280
First, you gotta hit that
button to take the brake off.

23:41.385 --> 23:42.628
Good man.

23:42.628 --> 23:45.009
Now, put it in drive
and you're all set.

23:45.009 --> 23:45.976
Okay?

23:45.976 --> 23:46.804
Put it in drive.

23:56.124 --> 23:57.021
- Where's McDick?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.267
- He's over there.

24:01.267 --> 24:03.303
- Why are you God
damn pointing at me?

24:12.968 --> 24:14.176
Hello?

24:14.176 --> 24:15.971
Hey, hey it's me.

24:15.971 --> 24:19.492
Listen, I can't really get into
this on the phone right now

24:19.492 --> 24:22.495
but I'm having some
work related issues

24:22.495 --> 24:24.980
and I need a place to
crash for like, two nights.

24:26.326 --> 24:27.500
Just two nights.

24:28.639 --> 24:30.917
Definitely not longer than like,

24:30.917 --> 24:31.884
four weeks.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.095
Well, my house isn't
safe right now.

24:36.095 --> 24:37.855
I was just there and
somebody was there with a gun

24:37.855 --> 24:40.133
so I had to run away
and now I'm here,

24:40.133 --> 24:41.583
I'm not even sure where I am.

24:43.965 --> 24:45.622
Well, I'm running
out of options.

24:47.589 --> 24:48.901
Oh, come on, mom.

24:52.214 --> 24:53.526
You there?

24:53.526 --> 24:54.389
Hello?

24:56.356 --> 24:57.496
Oh, God damn it.

24:59.463 --> 25:04.399
Fuck.

25:07.678 --> 25:08.990
- Here's a layout of the complex

25:08.990 --> 25:11.061
with all the potential
compromise points.

25:11.061 --> 25:13.546
Should we do a search
and secure the perimeter?

25:13.546 --> 25:15.168
- What, this building?

25:15.168 --> 25:16.756
Are you serious?

25:16.756 --> 25:18.137
- Yeah.

25:18.137 --> 25:18.965
- No.

25:18.965 --> 25:20.519
This is a safehouse.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.281
Listen, I have perfect
instincts, okay?

25:24.281 --> 25:25.938
You gotta start believing that.

25:25.938 --> 25:27.180
- Okay.

25:27.180 --> 25:30.045
- This building is the
last place on earth

25:30.045 --> 25:32.151
anybody's gonna come
looking for me, okay?

25:34.981 --> 25:35.810
What's this?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.055
You been spying on me?

25:40.055 --> 25:40.884
- No.

25:44.370 --> 25:45.371
- I'm not convinced.

25:48.719 --> 25:50.031
I'm not here.

25:50.031 --> 25:51.722
Especially if they
have an accent.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.553
- Hello?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.244
It's for you.

25:56.244 --> 25:57.659
- Who is it?

25:57.659 --> 25:59.937
- I'm not sure, I couldn't
really understand what he said.

25:59.937 --> 26:01.525
- Is it because
he has an accent?

26:03.769 --> 26:05.322
God damn it, give me the phone.

26:08.774 --> 26:10.016
Hello?

26:11.984 --> 26:12.812
Speaking.

26:15.643 --> 26:17.403
How do you know
I'm eating lettuce?

26:19.474 --> 26:21.027
Get down, get down!

26:21.890 --> 26:22.719
Get on top!

26:22.719 --> 26:23.789
Get on top!

26:23.789 --> 26:24.617
Let me protect your head.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.515
Oh yeah, I got ya.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.347
You gotta give 'em
like, two minutes.

26:30.347 --> 26:32.176
They probably think they hit us.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.315
- Okay.

26:33.315 --> 26:34.523
- Have you been hit?

26:34.523 --> 26:35.594
- No, I'm okay.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.456
- You sure?

26:36.456 --> 26:37.388
- Yeah.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.286
- Didn't get you anywhere?

26:38.286 --> 26:39.114
- Nope.

26:40.771 --> 26:43.015
So you know where I've
always wanted to go?

26:43.015 --> 26:44.464
- Where?

26:44.464 --> 26:45.914
- China.

26:45.914 --> 26:46.915
- Really?

26:46.915 --> 26:47.744
- Yeah.

26:47.744 --> 26:48.952
- Me too.

26:48.952 --> 26:50.747
You sure you weren't
hit around here?

26:50.747 --> 26:51.817
- I don't think so.

26:51.817 --> 26:53.681
- Okay, I'm just makin' sure.

26:53.681 --> 26:55.890
Okay, close your eyes
and think about China.

26:56.925 --> 26:57.754
Oh, yeah.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.205
They got pancakes
in China, right?

27:02.966 --> 27:04.415
Is that a yes or a no?

27:04.415 --> 27:05.900
- I don't know, I've never been.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.349
- Oh, Christ, okay.

27:07.349 --> 27:09.731
I think they're gone.

27:09.731 --> 27:10.870
- Hello,
Mister McDick.

27:10.870 --> 27:13.079
This is Douglas' mother calling.

27:13.079 --> 27:16.393
I discovered a small
handgun in his school bag

27:16.393 --> 27:18.602
and he tells me it was
one of several weapons

27:18.602 --> 27:19.534
you've given him.

27:19.534 --> 27:21.570
Listen very closely McDick,

27:21.570 --> 27:24.090
my son is no longer
your employee.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.610
If you attempt to contact him,

27:26.610 --> 27:31.097
I swear to God I will find
you and beat your.

28:03.612 --> 28:04.441
- Little jumpy?

28:04.441 --> 28:05.269
What's your name?

28:05.269 --> 28:06.201
- Giovanni.

28:06.201 --> 28:07.996
- Giovanni, empty your pockets.

28:09.308 --> 28:10.136
Fast.

28:11.206 --> 28:12.035
Lay on the table.

28:13.450 --> 28:14.658
On your stomach.

28:14.658 --> 28:15.624
Stop lookin' at me.

28:16.798 --> 28:17.834
What're you laughin' at?

28:17.834 --> 28:18.697
- Nothin'.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.319
- Nothin'?

28:20.319 --> 28:21.665
What's your name?

28:21.665 --> 28:22.597
- Roger.

28:22.597 --> 28:23.702
- Roger.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.633
Sit on the bar.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.672
Hurry up.

28:28.672 --> 28:31.502
One, two, one, two there you go.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.228
Sit like a little
baby bitch, okay?

28:33.228 --> 28:35.092
You got no laces in those shoes.

28:35.092 --> 28:36.645
- This guy's a jerk.

28:36.645 --> 28:38.233
- Excuse me, sir?

28:38.233 --> 28:39.441
I didn't catch that.

28:39.441 --> 28:41.512
Excuse me, why don't
you repeat that?

28:41.512 --> 28:42.790
- Just tryin' to have a beer.

28:42.790 --> 28:44.067
- Stand up!

28:44.067 --> 28:44.895
Get up.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.519
Now what'd you just say to me?

28:48.519 --> 28:50.452
- Sir, could you move that?

28:50.452 --> 28:52.558
- Repeat that, I
didn't hear you.

28:52.558 --> 28:53.870
- I just wanna
drink my beer, man.

28:53.870 --> 28:55.354
- I just wanna
drink my beer, man.

28:55.354 --> 28:59.392
- Sir, this gun, could
you just be careful, sir?

28:59.392 --> 29:00.600
- You and I get to go outside

29:00.600 --> 29:02.948
and have a private
conversation, alright?

29:02.948 --> 29:05.985
Bartender, if either two of
these vaginas open their...

29:05.985 --> 29:07.987
Hey man, close those legs!

29:07.987 --> 29:10.024
Who the hell lays like that?

29:10.024 --> 29:11.819
- If either two of these
vaginas open their lips,

29:11.819 --> 29:13.199
shoot 'em.

29:13.199 --> 29:14.683
Stand up straight!

29:14.683 --> 29:15.477
Let's go.

29:19.965 --> 29:21.552
- Was I convincing?

29:21.552 --> 29:22.830
- Yeah man, you were fine.

29:24.279 --> 29:26.385
Look, I don't know
what I got myself into,

29:26.385 --> 29:28.076
but I've been gettin'
shot at multiple times

29:28.076 --> 29:30.182
over the last couple days.

29:30.182 --> 29:32.115
Please tell me you
know something.

29:33.461 --> 29:34.738
- You really got no idea.

29:35.877 --> 29:37.914
Everyone's talkin' about you.

29:37.914 --> 29:40.054
Molten Lava, the Indians,

29:40.054 --> 29:43.091
even the tiny ass gangs
are talkin' about you.

29:43.091 --> 29:46.025
Some want you alive,
some want you dead.

29:46.025 --> 29:46.854
- Indians?

29:48.269 --> 29:50.754
You talkin' about the ones
that smell or the casino ones?

29:50.754 --> 29:51.824
- The ones from India.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.240
- Come on, man, this
is no joke, alright?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.828
This is real for me.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.105
- This ain't no joke.

29:57.105 --> 29:59.452
These people seriously
want your ass.

29:59.452 --> 30:01.351
- I didn't do anything!

30:01.351 --> 30:02.524
- Gotta be money.

30:02.524 --> 30:04.009
These people aren't
going to stop.

30:05.458 --> 30:08.599
- Well, in that case, shoot
me, 'cause I'm a dead man.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.222
At least I'll know who did it.

30:10.222 --> 30:11.050
- Relax.

30:12.224 --> 30:13.535
Carmichael's in town.

30:14.743 --> 30:17.919
You find him, maybe
you'll find answers.

30:20.888 --> 30:21.785
- Alright, Jimmy.

30:22.613 --> 30:23.683
Where do you want it?

30:24.719 --> 30:25.685
- Go with the face.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.102
- You ready?

30:28.102 --> 30:28.930
- Come on.

30:42.702 --> 30:44.532
- Alright, man,
follow me to the bar.

31:03.827 --> 31:04.724
Carmichael.

31:09.971 --> 31:10.834
Carmichael!

31:14.251 --> 31:15.770
I can wait all day.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.534
- Carmichael's dead.

31:21.534 --> 31:23.812
- Christ, you scared
the shit out of me, man.

31:24.813 --> 31:26.401
How many people have you killed?

31:27.816 --> 31:29.163
- It was a set up.

31:29.163 --> 31:30.440
- How do you know that?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.821
- Are you following
a retard right now?

31:32.821 --> 31:33.822
- Yes I am.

31:33.822 --> 31:35.652
How do you know that?

31:35.652 --> 31:39.552
- The lady that hired you
was married to your partner,

31:39.552 --> 31:41.313
who was stealin' from Lava.

31:41.313 --> 31:43.902
Lava forced her to
wiretap your office.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.869
That's how you got
that bullshit job.

31:47.388 --> 31:49.252
- Jesus Christ.

31:49.252 --> 31:50.736
How do you know all
this stuff, man?

31:50.736 --> 31:52.841
That's a lot of information.

31:52.841 --> 31:54.464
- Hey, you're the detective.

31:54.464 --> 31:56.811
- Yeah, I'm also the
fuckin' boss, okay?

31:56.811 --> 31:57.639
And I'm gettin' a
little sick and tired

31:57.639 --> 31:58.986
of your attitude lately.

31:58.986 --> 32:00.021
Don't forget that, man.

32:00.021 --> 32:01.989
I'm in charge, not you.

32:04.508 --> 32:07.373
- You're gettin' sick
and tired of my attitude?

32:07.373 --> 32:09.479
- Look, you're my lawyer.

32:09.479 --> 32:12.378
I'm pretty sure you're
not allowed to kill me.

32:12.378 --> 32:13.517
You got a little
piece of banana.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.243
Ow, shit!

32:16.762 --> 32:17.590
- Now here.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.180
One of Lava's men
wants to meet tonight.

32:23.010 --> 32:24.977
Tell him everything
he needs to know.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.634
- Please put it in
my God damn hand.

32:26.634 --> 32:27.635
It's sewed up.

32:28.567 --> 32:29.395
Thank you.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.673
Okay.

32:31.673 --> 32:32.743
You want me to leave first?

32:32.743 --> 32:33.606
You wanna leave first?

32:33.606 --> 32:34.504
Drive together?

32:34.504 --> 32:35.332
What do you think?

32:35.332 --> 32:36.264
- Get outta here.

32:36.264 --> 32:37.714
- Okay.

32:37.714 --> 32:38.749
- I wanna watch cartoons.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.372
- Enjoy that.

32:40.372 --> 32:45.377
Fuckin' asshole.

33:12.473 --> 33:14.751
- Why are we meeting in
the middle of nowhere?

33:14.751 --> 33:16.304
- Let me explain
somethin' to you.

33:16.304 --> 33:18.927
What happened the last
time we were at my office?

33:18.927 --> 33:19.998
- It got ransacked.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.482
- Correct.

33:21.482 --> 33:24.450
What happened the last time
we were at your apartment?

33:24.450 --> 33:25.382
- We got shot at.

33:25.382 --> 33:26.211
- Correct.

33:27.591 --> 33:28.834
Let me tell you somethin' else.

33:28.834 --> 33:32.493
Just now, Douglas
drove into my driveway,

33:32.493 --> 33:34.633
was mistaken for me,

33:34.633 --> 33:36.842
and he almost got his
fat little face shot off.

33:36.842 --> 33:39.155
- Douglas is too young to drive.

33:39.155 --> 33:41.398
- That's my point, none of
this makes sense right now.

33:41.398 --> 33:42.675
Okay?

33:42.675 --> 33:44.436
And until I gather
more information,

33:45.816 --> 33:47.853
we're gonna have to keep havin'
these secret rendezvouses.

33:47.853 --> 33:49.096
- I love rendezvouses.

33:49.096 --> 33:50.476
- Good.

33:50.476 --> 33:54.446
Listen, tonight I
am meeting this guy.

33:54.446 --> 33:56.482
He works for Molten Lava.

33:56.482 --> 33:57.311
This is the guy.

33:58.519 --> 34:01.004
Listen, if I don't make
it out of there alive,

34:01.004 --> 34:03.041
that means I'm probably dead

34:03.041 --> 34:07.355
and I need you to promise me
that you will make him pay.

34:07.355 --> 34:09.806
- How much does he owe you?

34:09.806 --> 34:11.221
- I'm not talking about money.

34:11.221 --> 34:14.085
I mean hold him accountable
for his actions.

34:14.085 --> 34:15.121
Can you promise me that?

34:15.121 --> 34:16.882
- Yeah, like,

34:16.882 --> 34:20.023
wrap him in a big rug and
have horses trample on him

34:20.023 --> 34:24.096
or get some oyster shells
and scrape away his face

34:24.096 --> 34:24.958
and burn him.

34:28.721 --> 34:30.137
- That would be fine.

34:30.137 --> 34:33.105
I mean, it's incredibly
violent, but that would do it.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.417
Alright, look, I've
got two more meetings

34:34.417 --> 34:36.522
on two different bridges so,

34:36.522 --> 34:38.041
I need you to walk away, okay?

34:43.045 --> 34:43.873
Walk faster.

34:47.188 --> 34:48.051
Faster.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.436
Okay, run.

34:53.436 --> 34:54.264
Just run.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.839
- Give me the account numbers.

35:19.047 --> 35:21.498
You'll get your half,
but Conroy's is ours.

35:22.672 --> 35:23.845
- Do you seriously
expect me to believe

35:23.845 --> 35:25.606
that Conroy was stealing money?

35:25.606 --> 35:27.642
- McDick, if you don't
give me the account numbers

35:27.642 --> 35:31.646
and location of our other
products right here right now,

35:31.646 --> 35:33.510
I'm gonna shoot you dead.

35:33.510 --> 35:36.755
- I think we both know that
that gun is not loaded.

35:40.276 --> 35:42.278
- What's with this guy
fainting all the time?

35:42.278 --> 35:44.625
Now this one is
really gonna hurt.

36:10.444 --> 36:12.170
- I heard about
everything on the news.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.101
- I'm fine.

36:15.552 --> 36:17.727
They were asking me
about account numbers.

36:17.727 --> 36:19.384
Account information.

36:19.384 --> 36:20.178
- What accounts?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.040
- I have no idea.

36:21.938 --> 36:23.250
Then there was a guy with a gun,

36:23.250 --> 36:25.010
he was wavin' that around,

36:25.010 --> 36:26.736
then somebody else had a
stun gun I got hit with that.

36:26.736 --> 36:28.841
- You need to report this.

36:28.841 --> 36:30.084
- There's nothing to report.

36:30.084 --> 36:31.327
I have no idea what's
goin' on right now.

36:31.327 --> 36:32.880
I need answers.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.192
What I have to do is go to
the top of the food chain

36:34.192 --> 36:35.607
on this one.

36:35.607 --> 36:37.264
And that's Molten Lava.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.787
On top of that, I
just hurt my hand.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.064
See it?

36:45.064 --> 36:45.893
I got blood.

36:46.825 --> 36:48.206
See the red spot?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.897
Blood there.

36:49.897 --> 36:51.588
- Well, let's go
get you cleaned up.

36:52.658 --> 36:53.866
- Can I get a bath maybe?

37:16.924 --> 37:18.443
- Mister McDick?

37:18.443 --> 37:19.271
A word?

37:21.239 --> 37:24.621
- I'm fine, but thank you.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.198
- Have a seat.

37:50.198 --> 37:51.993
- I think I'll
stand, but thank you.

37:53.132 --> 37:54.513
What's your name?

37:55.652 --> 37:58.552
What, you're not gonna
tell me your name?

37:58.552 --> 38:00.278
You know, pal, you need
to lighten up a little bit

38:00.278 --> 38:02.970
and that's something a little
smile could take care of.

38:05.006 --> 38:05.938
Ow, ow, I'm sorry!

38:05.938 --> 38:07.215
Please stop, please stop!

38:07.215 --> 38:08.216
- Let him go.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.048
- God damn it.

38:12.048 --> 38:14.292
What are you trying
to do, break my arm?

38:14.292 --> 38:15.776
- Sit down.

38:15.776 --> 38:16.639
- I was just trying to tell
you to smile a little bit.

38:18.261 --> 38:19.642
Can I sit here?
- Sit down!

38:26.027 --> 38:27.581
McDick.

38:27.581 --> 38:28.409
- Mmhmm.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.034
- You have a last name?

38:33.034 --> 38:34.898
- Just if I can maybe
stop you right here?

38:36.037 --> 38:37.763
If you plan on
sitting like this,

38:37.763 --> 38:39.109
I'm probably not gonna be able

38:39.109 --> 38:41.595
to concentrate on
the conversation.

38:41.595 --> 38:43.700
- Why are you spying on me?

38:43.700 --> 38:45.564
- I was not spying on you,

38:45.564 --> 38:48.567
I was looking at something
else, you happened to be there.

38:48.567 --> 38:49.672
- My guys get shot,

38:51.777 --> 38:53.434
somehow you survive.

38:53.434 --> 38:54.297
- Ow.

38:55.678 --> 38:59.337
- I know that you have my money.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.098
Money.

39:02.098 --> 39:03.133
My money.

39:10.727 --> 39:12.350
- Okay, let me tell
you a couple things.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.628
One: I don't know anything
about bank accounts

39:14.628 --> 39:16.664
or money.

39:16.664 --> 39:19.667
I do know that your guys
are trying to kill me.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.531
I also just got a fresh
piece of information

39:21.531 --> 39:24.223
and that's that this guy
right here is an asshole.

39:24.223 --> 39:25.949
Just tried to break my arm.

39:25.949 --> 39:28.331
So he could use a serious
attitude adjustment.

39:34.302 --> 39:35.580
- Okay.

39:35.580 --> 39:36.581
See this envelope?

39:36.581 --> 39:38.134
- Yes, I see it.

39:38.134 --> 39:40.757
Deliver this envelope to the
address written right here.

39:40.757 --> 39:42.207
Can you read?

39:42.207 --> 39:43.139
- I can read.

39:43.139 --> 39:43.933
- Can you?
- I can read.

39:43.933 --> 39:45.900
- You a reader, McDick?

39:45.900 --> 39:47.557
- Can you stop doing that?

39:47.557 --> 39:50.111
- Do not open the envelope.

39:51.009 --> 39:52.148
Unopened.

39:52.148 --> 39:53.874
I will have eyes on you.

39:53.874 --> 39:55.807
- So if I do this we're okay?

39:55.807 --> 39:57.429
- That's my promise to you.

39:58.326 --> 39:59.742
I got one more thing for you.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.301
Now you can go.

40:09.372 --> 40:10.442
Go.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.271
Go.
- Alright, alright.

40:12.271 --> 40:13.376
- Get, scoot.

40:14.964 --> 40:15.792
- Okay.

40:19.002 --> 40:19.831
Thank you.

42:27.130 --> 42:30.409
- Rashido wants this
beautiful piece of antique

42:30.409 --> 42:32.377
in Toshinia now.

42:32.377 --> 42:35.414
Irish investigation authorities
have been cooled down so,

42:37.209 --> 42:41.628
it has to get there through
the South American channel

42:42.801 --> 42:44.769
as soon as we get
our money in the

42:44.769 --> 42:48.013
Swiss hall bank account.

42:48.013 --> 42:50.015
- Consider everything
covered, boss.

42:50.015 --> 42:51.154
- Good, good.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.089
- Hey, who the hell are you?

42:55.089 --> 42:56.435
- What is this place?

42:56.435 --> 42:57.436
- Is this our buyer?

42:58.645 --> 42:59.577
- How come you're
not wearing pants?

42:59.577 --> 43:00.612
- Beg your pardon?

43:00.612 --> 43:01.682
- Beg for a pair of pants.

43:01.682 --> 43:03.201
- Hey, come on.

43:03.201 --> 43:04.685
First off, you tell me like,

43:04.685 --> 43:06.963
how did you get here?

43:06.963 --> 43:09.276
Who gave you the
address of this place?

43:09.276 --> 43:11.174
- You guys sell this stuff?

43:11.174 --> 43:12.866
This is a piece of shit.

43:12.866 --> 43:14.592
- Put it back, you junkie.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.007
Do you know what's that?

43:16.007 --> 43:18.596
That's a fuckin' three
million dollars right there.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.081
Did you ever see
that kind of money?

43:21.081 --> 43:21.909
- Maybe.

43:21.909 --> 43:23.393
- Hey, listen.

43:23.393 --> 43:26.914
This was discovered in
the graves of Mesopotamia.

43:26.914 --> 43:28.985
Dated 300 A.D.

43:31.332 --> 43:32.161
And

43:33.369 --> 43:34.197
I

43:35.129 --> 43:37.338
Stole it from the Louvre.

43:37.338 --> 43:39.686
- You stole it
from the bathroom?

43:39.686 --> 43:41.066
I'm impressed.

43:41.066 --> 43:43.482
Come on, guys, listen,

43:43.482 --> 43:45.208
a friend of mine asked
me to deliver this

43:45.208 --> 43:46.624
to whoever's in charge here.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.972
I'm gonna go ahead
and guess it's not you

43:49.972 --> 43:51.594
'cause you're not wearing pants.

43:52.733 --> 43:55.184
- Give the fucking God
damn envelope to me.

44:09.198 --> 44:10.648
- Guys, we good here?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.546
I'm getting a little
uncomfortable.

44:12.546 --> 44:14.168
- Are you done looking
at the boxes now?

44:14.168 --> 44:15.445
- Yeah, I'm done.

44:16.826 --> 44:20.105
- So you inspected the whole
place very well, right?

44:20.105 --> 44:22.798
- Yeah, you got another
little shit hole here.

44:22.798 --> 44:25.559
- So now you know me very well.

44:25.559 --> 44:26.974
- I know that you're very short,

44:26.974 --> 44:28.251
but that's okay, you're
compensating with those boots

44:28.251 --> 44:29.528
and it does lift
you up a little bit.

44:29.528 --> 44:33.015
- I know your identity, so...

44:35.258 --> 44:36.501
Are you ready to die?

44:39.918 --> 44:42.610
- Gentlemen, I'm a
private detective

44:42.610 --> 44:45.648
and so what that means is
I'm very good at telling

44:45.648 --> 44:46.649
if somebody's lying.

44:50.204 --> 44:51.758
- Little baby detective.

44:53.552 --> 44:55.658
- That how you
guys really laugh?

44:55.658 --> 44:58.247
Listen, I never
told you who I am.

44:59.110 --> 45:00.352
- Really?

45:00.352 --> 45:01.664
- That's your one
little misstep.

45:01.664 --> 45:03.079
Nice try though,
I appreciate it.

45:03.079 --> 45:03.873
Good effort.

45:07.981 --> 45:09.741
This is a picture of me.

45:09.741 --> 45:10.846
- Of course it's you.

45:12.606 --> 45:15.229
- Was this in the
envelope I just gave you?

45:15.229 --> 45:16.058
- Yes you did.

45:17.991 --> 45:18.819
- Molten Lava.

45:23.513 --> 45:24.756
- So what do you say now?

45:25.895 --> 45:29.036
- Men, I have one last
bit of information

45:29.036 --> 45:30.831
that you might like to hear.

45:30.831 --> 45:31.694
- Okay?

45:33.282 --> 45:34.973
- You're listening?

45:34.973 --> 45:35.802
Okay.

46:34.619 --> 46:37.829
- Uh huh.

46:37.829 --> 46:40.073
Well, why don't you tell
Hunter that if this doesn't

46:40.073 --> 46:41.799
shake out exactly
as I planned it,

46:41.799 --> 46:44.732
I will cut off his balls
and hang them on my wall?

46:46.182 --> 46:47.011
Yeah.

46:47.011 --> 46:47.839
Just like that.

46:49.841 --> 46:50.808
Yeah?

46:50.808 --> 46:52.223
- Sorry to bother you captain,

46:52.223 --> 46:55.122
but a former officer
McDick is here to see you.

46:56.261 --> 46:57.815
- Jesus Christ, is he really?

47:00.783 --> 47:01.611
Send him in.

47:03.061 --> 47:04.683
What the hell are you wearing?

47:04.683 --> 47:06.375
I fired you months ago.

47:06.375 --> 47:08.584
- I am undercover
as a uniformed cop.

47:08.584 --> 47:10.068
- Excuse me!

47:10.068 --> 47:11.863
- You know what, I don't have
any time for your bullshit.

47:11.863 --> 47:14.555
I need you to place me
in Wit Pro immediately.

47:15.936 --> 47:17.524
- Place you in Wit Pro?

47:17.524 --> 47:18.801
- Yeah.

47:18.801 --> 47:20.838
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

47:20.838 --> 47:23.564
Do you realize how much of a
pain in my ass you've become?

47:23.564 --> 47:25.912
Jesus Christ, it's worse
than when you were here!

47:25.912 --> 47:27.775
- People are trying to kill me.

47:27.775 --> 47:29.363
I need you to turn
me into a ghost

47:29.363 --> 47:31.124
and Wit Pro is the only option.

47:31.124 --> 47:34.299
- Well, tell me, what
have you witnessed?

47:34.299 --> 47:35.853
- I don't know.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.131
But clearly my ex-partner
Conroy was mixed up in it.

47:38.131 --> 47:41.893
- Do not speak ill of
that fine fallen officer.

47:41.893 --> 47:44.206
- Well, every time I'm shot
at, punched in the face,

47:44.206 --> 47:46.001
or chased, his name comes up.

47:46.001 --> 47:47.312
So what am I supposed to think?

47:47.312 --> 47:48.866
- Let me tell you
something, McDick.

47:48.866 --> 47:52.904
Thugs that this department
have been after for years

47:52.904 --> 47:54.181
are coming after you.

47:55.838 --> 47:58.461
We even got a couple
leads on the Indians.

47:58.461 --> 48:00.015
I didn't think they had
anything serious goin' on

48:00.015 --> 48:01.879
in this town, but there is.

48:02.810 --> 48:04.778
You are a magnet.

48:05.848 --> 48:07.401
And let me tell you something.

48:07.401 --> 48:08.886
Two great things
can come from this.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.647
One: I get to catch
a bunch of bad guys.

48:11.647 --> 48:13.891
And two: They catch you.

48:13.891 --> 48:14.822
So there you go.

48:14.822 --> 48:15.996
- Clearly wasted your time.

48:15.996 --> 48:17.032
- Of course you have.
- I apologize.

48:17.032 --> 48:18.930
One final question: bagpipes?

48:18.930 --> 48:20.173
- Yeah,
what about 'em?

48:20.173 --> 48:22.313
- Wouldn't you say the
kilt is a little short?

48:22.313 --> 48:24.936
- Okay, they didn't
have the right...

48:24.936 --> 48:26.593
- The reason I ask, I
just figured at night

48:26.593 --> 48:27.905
your vagina might--

48:27.905 --> 48:29.941
- Okay, are we done here?
- I think so.

48:29.941 --> 48:30.804
I will be...

48:30.804 --> 48:31.839
- I said are we done?

48:36.879 --> 48:38.053
- McDick.

48:38.053 --> 48:39.468
- Oh, what's up asshole?

48:39.468 --> 48:41.780
- We already got your
lover and now you and I

48:41.780 --> 48:43.299
are gonna take a little walk.

48:43.299 --> 48:44.645
- You talkin' about Virginia?

48:44.645 --> 48:46.993
We actually haven't
sealed the deal yet.

48:49.064 --> 48:49.927
- Let's go.

49:14.986 --> 49:17.920
- Hey, hello,
Douglas, hey it's me.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.164
Listen, I'm in a little
bit of trouble right now.

49:20.164 --> 49:22.718
I've got one of Molten
Lava's guys comin' after me.

49:24.478 --> 49:25.686
No, I'm fine at the moment.

49:25.686 --> 49:28.344
I outran the guy, but
listen, I need you

49:28.344 --> 49:30.968
to trace my cell
signal immediately.

49:32.866 --> 49:34.281
I was runnin' around
hoppin' fences,

49:34.281 --> 49:35.627
I have no idea where
I am right now.

49:35.627 --> 49:37.457
I need you to trace
my cell signal.

49:38.389 --> 49:39.217
You understand?

49:40.529 --> 49:41.461
Yeah, then just come get me.

49:41.461 --> 49:42.289
You or your mom.

49:43.670 --> 49:44.498
Thank you.

49:56.994 --> 50:01.067
I have somebody tracing
my exact location

50:01.067 --> 50:02.275
with my cell signal.

50:03.207 --> 50:04.967
It's called using your brain.

50:04.967 --> 50:05.795
Ow.

50:07.832 --> 50:09.937
Let me ask you a question.

50:09.937 --> 50:11.594
They ever arrest that guy?

50:11.594 --> 50:12.423
- What guy?

50:13.631 --> 50:15.150
- The guy that stole your chin.

50:50.081 --> 50:51.324
- Hey, McDick.

50:51.324 --> 50:53.050
Your partner's wife
was found dead,

50:53.947 --> 50:55.983
so expect to be arrested.

50:55.983 --> 50:59.677
But don't worry, I'll
get the charges dropped.

51:43.652 --> 51:46.965
- That briefcase contained
documents linking you and Conroy

51:46.965 --> 51:50.072
to 10 years of corrupt
dealings in crimes.

51:50.072 --> 51:51.038
- How convenient.

51:52.523 --> 51:55.457
- It also had some footage
of you going into Georgies

51:55.457 --> 51:57.390
right before the
place got shot up.

51:57.390 --> 51:59.288
Got rid of Edson and
Conroy then you figured,

51:59.288 --> 52:01.704
hey maybe Conroy
involved his fiance

52:01.704 --> 52:05.122
so you two tangled and we
all know where that left her.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.502
Dead in bed.

52:06.502 --> 52:07.952
- Are you done yet?

52:07.952 --> 52:10.575
- Two million bail says you're
a dangerous man, McDick.

52:11.990 --> 52:15.062
- Well, this dangerous
man is ready for some R&R

52:15.062 --> 52:17.134
in a place where nobody
can shoot at him.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.204
- He made bail.

52:18.204 --> 52:19.066
- What?

52:21.034 --> 52:22.173
Who put up two million?

52:23.554 --> 52:25.038
Munpoon, what?

52:25.038 --> 52:27.592
- Munpoon, that's the
guy who tried to kill me.

52:28.869 --> 52:30.423
- That's right.

52:30.423 --> 52:31.665
Come on, McDick.

52:31.665 --> 52:34.151
You can't stay here on
the taxpayer's dime.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.393
- Well, if there's
one thing I know,

52:35.393 --> 52:37.464
it's that I'm not
leaving here today.

52:39.466 --> 52:40.295
- Haul him out.

52:48.717 --> 52:50.339
- Hey,
McDick the gray.

52:51.340 --> 52:52.169
- Munpoon.

52:53.618 --> 52:56.242
- So, you happy now you
are released from the jail?

52:56.242 --> 52:58.002
- Oh, I'm thrilled.

52:58.002 --> 53:00.384
Thanks for your
help, appreciate it.

53:00.384 --> 53:02.834
- Oh, cool, cool, nice.

53:02.834 --> 53:04.422
Hey, why don't you
get in the car?

53:04.422 --> 53:05.803
Let me give you a ride, come on!

53:05.803 --> 53:06.873
- No, I'm gonna walk.

53:06.873 --> 53:08.668
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna walk.

53:08.668 --> 53:11.533
- Why you little
baby fuck detective.

53:12.810 --> 53:14.121
- What'd you just call me?

53:18.367 --> 53:21.405
- I did call you
baby little fuck.

53:22.544 --> 53:23.752
- A gun, really?

53:23.752 --> 53:24.684
- Yeah,
would you come in now?

53:24.684 --> 53:26.133
- It's broad daylight, man.

53:26.133 --> 53:27.825
- Yes, I'm going to
fucking blow your head off

53:27.825 --> 53:29.275
in the broad daylight.

53:32.036 --> 53:33.210
- Jesus Christ.

53:48.155 --> 53:49.156
Can you give a brother a smoke?

53:49.156 --> 53:50.227
These are tense times.

53:54.058 --> 53:55.232
- There you go.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.750
- Not if it was in your
mouth, God damn it.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.545
What's wrong with you?

53:58.545 --> 54:00.167
Put it in my mouth
and then light it.

54:00.167 --> 54:01.134
- Fuck you.

54:05.587 --> 54:06.415
Here you go.

54:06.415 --> 54:07.244
- Watch the...

54:09.625 --> 54:12.249
Don't set my hair on fire.
- Come on.

54:14.665 --> 54:15.700
The legendary McDick.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.221
- Let me tell you somethin'
right now, asshole.

54:19.221 --> 54:20.809
I'm here because of what I know

54:20.809 --> 54:22.569
and what I have stashed.

54:22.569 --> 54:26.573
You cannot hurt me because
I'm way too valuable.

54:27.988 --> 54:32.545
- The only thing we know
here for absolute certainty,

54:35.030 --> 54:39.276
that you know nothing
and you never have.

54:40.725 --> 54:45.282
Your partner had his dick
in so many mashed potatoes.

54:46.421 --> 54:47.353
He tells everyone.

54:47.353 --> 54:49.009
He shared it with you, too.

54:49.009 --> 54:50.735
But did he

54:50.735 --> 54:54.152
ever tell you about those
mashed potatoes, huh?

54:56.948 --> 54:59.261
- What are you doing, man?

54:59.261 --> 55:00.366
What's wrong with you?

55:00.366 --> 55:01.401
Trying to seduce
me or something?

55:01.401 --> 55:02.264
Back up.

55:03.679 --> 55:06.682
- He was stealing money left
and right from everyone.

55:07.856 --> 55:10.824
The time he got killed,
you didn't take over

55:10.824 --> 55:14.000
so every party involved
in there thinks

55:14.000 --> 55:15.484
that you are the rat

55:17.969 --> 55:20.178
and they tried to kill you.

55:24.251 --> 55:25.425
- Who does that?

55:25.425 --> 55:27.254
Who laughs and hits
the side of their face?

55:28.601 --> 55:29.395
- It's amazing.

55:30.706 --> 55:32.708
They want to kill you
for what you know.

55:35.159 --> 55:36.505
But, in fact,

55:38.058 --> 55:42.166
you are the dumbest
son of the bitch

55:42.166 --> 55:44.099
on this fuckin' planet.

55:45.307 --> 55:46.826
- For argument's sake,
let's say you're right

55:46.826 --> 55:51.106
and I am in fact the dumbest
son of the bitch on the planet.

55:51.106 --> 55:52.245
Let's talk solutions.

55:54.558 --> 55:56.180
- Solutions?

55:56.180 --> 55:57.319
Should that partner

55:58.838 --> 56:01.116
didn't include us on the table.

56:01.116 --> 56:04.775
He excluded all
Indians from the table.

56:04.775 --> 56:06.224
- So now the little Indians want

56:06.224 --> 56:08.848
their little seat at
the table, I get it.

56:08.848 --> 56:11.264
- Now I want the whole table.

56:14.060 --> 56:15.510
- Okay, so what does
that have to do with me?

56:15.510 --> 56:18.444
You just said so yourself,
I don't know anything.

56:18.444 --> 56:20.377
- I'm going to use you.

56:21.861 --> 56:23.380
Everybody wants to kill you.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.244
And while they chop you up,

56:26.244 --> 56:28.557
I am going to chalk them up.

56:29.938 --> 56:32.112
- What are you talking
about chopping?

56:32.112 --> 56:34.183
You mean like, with knives?

56:34.183 --> 56:35.702
I don't like knives.

56:36.876 --> 56:37.877
- You mother fucker.

56:50.717 --> 56:51.753
- I like those shoes.

56:53.617 --> 56:54.445
- Come on.

56:55.584 --> 56:56.413
- You brought me a hat!

56:59.277 --> 57:00.106
Thank you.

57:04.075 --> 57:05.318
How'd you find me?

57:05.318 --> 57:07.596
- I put a GPS tracking
device in your shoe

57:07.596 --> 57:10.461
and executed some undercover
and evasion techniques.

57:10.461 --> 57:12.152
- Clearly, I've taught you well.

57:14.534 --> 57:15.880
- We need to go.

57:25.476 --> 57:27.305
Okay, you should make the 6:30.

57:27.305 --> 57:29.791
This is your passport,
driver's license, cash.

57:29.791 --> 57:32.656
I read a book about forgeries,
those were part of it.

57:33.864 --> 57:34.968
Should get you out
of here for good.

57:36.487 --> 57:37.419
- Where are yours?

57:42.182 --> 57:43.908
- I didn't think...

57:43.908 --> 57:45.807
- Listen, I'm not gonna
leave here without you.

57:47.912 --> 57:51.019
We're gonna go find
Douglas right now, okay,

57:51.019 --> 57:53.159
and then we're gonna
finish this together.

57:53.159 --> 57:53.987
As a team.

57:55.402 --> 57:56.645
Alright?

57:56.645 --> 57:57.612
Once and for all.

57:57.612 --> 57:58.475
Start the car.

58:25.087 --> 58:27.952
- You've got 60 seconds.

58:27.952 --> 58:29.678
- Alright, look, I know
I messed up, alright?

58:29.678 --> 58:31.956
I've put you in a
couple tough spots,

58:31.956 --> 58:34.545
dangerous situations, and
I almost got you killed.

58:34.545 --> 58:35.408
I apologize.

58:38.687 --> 58:39.930
Look at me.

58:39.930 --> 58:40.758
Are we okay now?

58:43.002 --> 58:44.106
- What's my job, boss?

58:44.969 --> 58:46.971
- That's a very good question.

58:46.971 --> 58:48.455
Listen, Melanie's gonna call you

58:48.455 --> 58:50.319
in about 30 minutes, alright?

58:50.319 --> 58:51.666
She'll give you
all those details.

58:51.666 --> 58:56.015
In the mean time, I
want you to take this.

58:56.015 --> 58:57.948
You're probably
not gonna need it,

58:57.948 --> 59:00.675
but just in case you've got
yourself a little hand cannon.

59:00.675 --> 59:01.503
Alright?

59:01.503 --> 59:02.642
It's fine, it's clean.

59:02.642 --> 59:03.505
Put it away.

59:05.749 --> 59:07.647
- Let's hope I don't use it.

59:07.647 --> 59:09.166
- Listen to me, listen to me.

59:09.166 --> 59:12.859
Go back in the house, go to
your room, wait for the call.

59:13.998 --> 59:14.827
Good man.

01:01:35.795 --> 01:01:36.658
- What?

01:01:38.142 --> 01:01:40.731
McDick has been off
the grid for 24 hours.

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.595
You're gonna find him, right?

01:01:42.595 --> 01:01:44.804
And you're gonna
bring him to me,

01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:46.633
and I'm gonna set
his penis on fire.

01:01:56.574 --> 01:01:57.403
Damn it!

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.878
- I need to talk right now.

01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:00.466
- You have gotta be kidding me.

01:03:00.466 --> 01:03:01.398
- No, I'm not.

01:03:01.398 --> 01:03:02.226
Can I come in?

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.445
These are testicles.

01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:18.104
- White rhino balls.

01:03:18.104 --> 01:03:18.933
South African.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:21.349
This is my balls wall.

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:25.663
I kill 'em, I cut 'em,
I stuff 'em, I hang 'em.

01:03:27.044 --> 01:03:29.806
There's only one species of
any significance I do not have.

01:03:36.571 --> 01:03:37.399
Now,

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:42.232
it doesn't matter if
you know for a fact

01:03:42.232 --> 01:03:44.821
that Molten has a mountain
of incriminating evidence

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:45.856
in her home.

01:03:48.928 --> 01:03:51.828
The police can't just
come into somebody's house

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:55.417
because some fired cop
who's out on probation

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:56.833
for murder charges says so.

01:03:58.179 --> 01:04:01.907
- You know what, I
have seen hard evidence

01:04:01.907 --> 01:04:05.082
that this woman has
framed me for murder.

01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:07.326
Now, how is there nothing
we can do about this?

01:04:07.326 --> 01:04:09.431
- Here's the thing, McDick.

01:04:09.431 --> 01:04:11.675
Molten is a very smart criminal.

01:04:11.675 --> 01:04:15.886
She understands the value of
keeping things under the radar.

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:17.784
Have you ever seen
her out at a club?

01:04:18.924 --> 01:04:22.720
No, she wants to party,
she does it on a boat.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.274
Three miles out.

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:25.620
International waters.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:28.865
Very smart.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:29.969
- Great, you know what?

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:32.730
That's perfect.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.559
- Listen.

01:04:34.732 --> 01:04:37.632
You figure out a way to
get her on the radar,

01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:42.533
and you might actually
have some success.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:49.299
Now, if you'll be so kind

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:51.266
as to get the hell
out of my sight,

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:52.164
I can go to bed.

01:05:07.317 --> 01:05:09.077
- Did I do something
wrong again?

01:05:09.077 --> 01:05:10.596
- No, I don't think so.

01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:15.049
Look, I got a bunch of
people comin' after me

01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:16.636
and I'm really
desperate right now

01:05:16.636 --> 01:05:19.985
and I just need to do
a little brainstorming.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:22.470
So, can I come in?

01:05:23.402 --> 01:05:24.196
- Yeah.

01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:06.134
Hey, I gotta go to work, so,
can you lock up when you leave?

01:06:06.134 --> 01:06:07.411
- Yeah, sure.

01:06:07.411 --> 01:06:08.757
- Okay.
- Alright.

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:10.552
- Bye.
- I'll see you.

01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:11.381
Thank you.

01:06:21.149 --> 01:06:22.254
Are you gone?

01:07:25.903 --> 01:07:27.733
- Are you okay?

01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:29.045
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.669
- Look, I'm really
starting to get worried.

01:07:32.669 --> 01:07:34.843
I don't think it's
too late to back out.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:38.088
Why don't we just get on
a boat and go somewhere.

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:39.296
- Where are we gonna go?

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:41.367
- I don't know.

01:07:42.644 --> 01:07:44.405
We can go to China.

01:07:44.405 --> 01:07:46.855
You know we've always talked
about wanting to go there.

01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:51.412
- Look, one day I'll
take you to China.

01:07:51.412 --> 01:07:52.965
I promise, alright?

01:07:54.484 --> 01:07:57.280
Right now, we need
to stay in town

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.454
and execute the master plan
that I just came up with

01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:01.180
last night when I
was takin' a shit.

01:08:02.492 --> 01:08:03.320
- Do tell.

01:08:05.909 --> 01:08:06.910
- Come here.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.401
Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:15.401 --> 01:08:16.540
- Go around that way.

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:20.043
- Hey there, I have a
delivery for Molten Lava.

01:10:20.043 --> 01:10:21.251
- Really, McDick?

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:24.496
You know, even for you,
this is embarrassing.

01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:40.374
- Let's go.

01:11:55.897 --> 01:11:57.313
Well hello there, young lady.

01:11:59.832 --> 01:12:01.386
- I don't know
what you're up to,

01:12:02.766 --> 01:12:05.666
but how do you possibly
expect whatever the hell it is

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:07.564
you're gonna do to work?

01:12:07.564 --> 01:12:10.395
- There is evidence
in this house

01:12:10.395 --> 01:12:12.983
that you have framed
me for murder.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:15.434
I could spend my life in jail.

01:12:17.263 --> 01:12:19.024
So I have three options for you.

01:12:19.024 --> 01:12:22.510
One: You go to the cops,
come clean, I'm off the hook.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:24.823
- Not gonna happen.

01:12:24.823 --> 01:12:26.342
Two?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:29.621
- Two: I set off a series of
explosions here in the house

01:12:29.621 --> 01:12:32.831
that will attract the cops,
they'll seize the evidence

01:12:32.831 --> 01:12:33.935
and you'll go to jail.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:36.835
- Bang, no.

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:39.251
- That leaves us
with number three

01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:40.804
and this is an interesting one.

01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:43.704
You and I

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.500
have sex.

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:48.950
Right now.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.679
Forget about the
past, clean slate,

01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:56.441
what do you say?

01:12:58.788 --> 01:13:00.341
Is that a yes?

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:01.756
- I'm gonna kill you tonight.

01:13:03.586 --> 01:13:05.346
You broke into my home.

01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:07.313
You're trespassing.

01:13:07.313 --> 01:13:10.282
I have every right to kill you.

01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:12.905
I guess you forgot
to think about that.

01:13:12.905 --> 01:13:16.978
- Three, two--
- Backwards, wow.

01:13:16.978 --> 01:13:17.807
- One.

01:13:19.636 --> 01:13:20.913
- What the fuck was that?

01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:23.053
- I just blew up
half your house.

01:13:23.053 --> 01:13:24.641
- I'm gonna slash
your fucking throat.

01:13:24.641 --> 01:13:26.402
- Alright, hey, Douglas?

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.989
You know what, go ahead and
set off those fire crackers.

01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:29.232
She's not listening to me.

01:13:29.232 --> 01:13:30.475
- Oh, yeah, Douglas,
why not, huh?

01:13:30.475 --> 01:13:31.648
Let's bring the 4th
of July up in here.

01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:34.996
- You know what, that's
a very nice dance.

01:13:34.996 --> 01:13:37.896
I say we relax, slip
between the sheets.

01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:38.966
- I'm relaxed.

01:13:38.966 --> 01:13:40.519
- I think we're gonna do this--

01:13:40.519 --> 01:13:41.382
- Let's do this.

01:13:42.487 --> 01:13:43.936
Take that!

01:13:43.936 --> 01:13:44.765
Momma's comin'.

01:13:44.765 --> 01:13:45.697
You want this tonight?

01:13:45.697 --> 01:13:46.560
- What the hell are you doing?

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.768
- You want this tonight?

01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:49.597
- Not the face,
not the tie either.

01:13:50.495 --> 01:13:51.599
Give me a kiss.

01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:00.228
I got a hair in my mouth.

01:14:02.403 --> 01:14:03.749
Take off your shirt.

01:14:18.212 --> 01:14:19.489
Wait, are we having
sex right now?

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:20.352
- Nope.

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.528
- Come here you little bitch.

01:14:23.528 --> 01:14:25.115
- What'd you call me?

01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:25.944
- I called you a little bitch.

01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:26.876
- What'd you call me?

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.020
You think you can handle that?

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.475
- Just sit on my face.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.821
I'm just gonna go home now.

01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:44.134
Take off your shirt.

01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:04.741
- I just took down
the biggest crime lord

01:15:04.741 --> 01:15:07.710
this side of the
Mississippi, okay?

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.194
You know what the
Mississippi is?

01:15:09.194 --> 01:15:11.714
And you're telling me
you're gonna hold me here

01:15:11.714 --> 01:15:13.336
for interrogation?

01:15:13.336 --> 01:15:14.579
It's outrageous!

01:15:14.579 --> 01:15:16.408
- The only thing I wanna
hear out of you, McDick,

01:15:16.408 --> 01:15:17.892
is silence.

01:15:17.892 --> 01:15:19.963
- What do you do,
stand up off the clock?

01:15:19.963 --> 01:15:21.689
Listen, you should
be on the phone

01:15:21.689 --> 01:15:24.312
with your superior, organizing
a parade in my honor.

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:25.486
This is outrageous.

01:15:31.699 --> 01:15:33.805
- What are you guys
whispering about?

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.050
Listen, Melanie, just
because I've been arrested,

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.293
doesn't mean you have
to be arrested too.

01:15:39.293 --> 01:15:41.122
You should get
out of here, okay?

01:15:41.122 --> 01:15:42.779
They know that you work for me.

01:15:42.779 --> 01:15:44.609
- Alright, shut up and listen.

01:15:44.609 --> 01:15:45.817
- What's wrong with you?

01:15:45.817 --> 01:15:47.543
- I've been working
undercover for Interpol

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.545
for the last two years
bringing down a network

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.132
of criminals.

01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:54.135
You were the perfect Patsy
for the Molten Lava sting.

01:15:54.135 --> 01:15:55.792
- What's Interpol?

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:57.035
What're you talkin' about?

01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:59.451
- You're facing at least
ten years behind bars.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.420
But, lucky for you, the
game has just changed.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.043
- What game?

01:16:05.043 --> 01:16:07.045
This isn't fun, what're
you talking about?

01:16:07.045 --> 01:16:08.218
You've been lying to
me this entire time?

01:16:08.218 --> 01:16:11.221
- My biggest target,
Count Velvet,

01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:13.361
has gone missing
somewhere in Asia.

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.778
With him, it's personal.

01:16:15.778 --> 01:16:17.296
Not only do I need
to capture him,

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:19.954
I need to break his soul, okay?

01:16:19.954 --> 01:16:21.818
The things I need
to do with him?

01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:23.371
Even the law won't allow.

01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:25.304
We're going off grid.

01:16:25.304 --> 01:16:27.237
- Count Velvet, is
that what you said?

01:16:27.237 --> 01:16:28.066
I don't care about him.

01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:29.136
I don't care about Asia.

01:16:29.136 --> 01:16:30.240
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.070
- I stole this from the CIA

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:34.382
and you're going to help
me smuggle it into Asia

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.557
so that I can
destroy Count Velvet.

01:16:37.869 --> 01:16:40.250
- I am not smuggling anything.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.632
Let me be very clear about that.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.841
- You have two choices.

01:16:44.841 --> 01:16:48.500
One: You can voluntarily
remove your pants,

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.641
allow me to insert this
into a deep cavity,

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:54.264
and I don't mean your teeth.

01:16:54.264 --> 01:16:58.199
Or two: I can inject
you with this,

01:16:58.199 --> 01:16:59.994
which will allow me
to do what I must

01:16:59.994 --> 01:17:02.618
but it may leave you
permanently impotent.

01:17:03.515 --> 01:17:04.654
- Impotent.

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:05.586
- Impotent.

01:17:06.967 --> 01:17:09.038
- I would rather be executed.

01:17:09.038 --> 01:17:11.730
So, why don't you
march downstairs

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:13.180
and get my lawyer on the phone.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.423
- This is your last chance.

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:17.011
What's it gonna be?

01:17:18.047 --> 01:17:19.289
- Can I ask you something?

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:22.534
Is this real?

01:17:24.191 --> 01:17:25.364
- As real as it gets.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.474
- Okay.

01:17:34.926 --> 01:17:35.858
- Good boy.

01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:34.468
You've had money stolen
out of your Belize account.

01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:37.298
I don't give a shit about you

01:18:37.298 --> 01:18:40.439
but I know who's behind
this and I will find him.

01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:41.544
- Who stole my money?

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:45.893
- He found out that you
stole Molten Lava's money

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:47.826
and he knows it was
you who framed him.

01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:50.070
- Where is he?

01:18:51.243 --> 01:18:53.314
- We lost him about two
weeks ago in Beijing,

01:18:53.314 --> 01:18:55.592
but he was captured
on camera last night

01:18:55.592 --> 01:18:58.216
sprinting through a Paris
hotel without his pants on.

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:03.808
I need you to help me
lure him back stateside.

01:19:06.396 --> 01:19:08.053
- Whatever it takes.

01:19:22.516 --> 01:19:23.344
McDick!

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.761
You motherfucker.
