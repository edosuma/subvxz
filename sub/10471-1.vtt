01:36.140 --> 01:39.219
Who do you think you are?!
Who do you think you are?

01:39.220 --> 01:40.580
Come on, then! Come on!

01:45.165 --> 01:49.502
'I must have been mad.
I could have been an air hostess.

01:49.728 --> 01:51.659
'I could have been a model.

01:51.660 --> 01:54.699
'I could have moved to Paris
or been a concert pianist.

01:54.700 --> 01:59.659
'I could have seen the world,
been brave, followed my heart.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.099
'But I didn't.

02:01.100 --> 02:05.539
'I side-stepped love and set off
for the East End of London,

02:05.540 --> 02:08.459
'because I thought
it would be easier.

02:08.460 --> 02:12.580
'Madness was the only explanation.'

02:18.940 --> 02:20.699
I am not a whore!

02:20.700 --> 02:22.459
Only cos he never paid ya!

02:22.460 --> 02:24.779
Well, I had him
weeping with gratitude!

02:24.780 --> 02:26.139
Well, he's my husband!

02:26.140 --> 02:28.580
I'll bloody kill him
once I've finished with you!

02:30.620 --> 02:32.379
Ladies, lay off it! Pack it in.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.220
Come on!

02:36.340 --> 02:39.420
That's it! Go on!

02:41.860 --> 02:43.740
Come on, girls. Break it up now...

02:46.860 --> 02:50.420
Right! Which one of you ladies
is my patient?

02:54.340 --> 02:57.220
Pearl Winston.
Why am I not surprised?

02:58.380 --> 03:02.940
Constable, Mrs Winston
would appreciate your tunic.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.019
And don't get any blood on it.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.660
It's seen worse.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.699
Tart! Wicked bitch!

03:15.700 --> 03:19.860
'Midwifery is the very stuff
of life.

03:21.260 --> 03:25.379
'Every child is conceived
in love, or lust,

03:25.380 --> 03:31.220
'and born in pain followed by joy,
or by tragedy and anguish.

03:32.860 --> 03:37.499
'Every birth is attended by a
midwife. She is in the thick of it.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.620
'She sees it all.

04:01.580 --> 04:05.179
'I knew nothing of poverty
or appalling housing,

04:05.180 --> 04:10.499
'nothing of lice, of filth,
of families sleeping four to a bed,

04:10.500 --> 04:15.299
'and nothing of the passion
that brings on baby after baby,

04:15.300 --> 04:17.699
'labour after labour.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.220
'I knew nothing of life itself.'

04:50.140 --> 04:52.899
Hello. I'm Jennifer Lee.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.779
I was told to report
to the matron in charge.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.019
Venus and Saturn
are now in alignment.

04:58.020 --> 05:01.699
It is entirely appropriate
that you should appear!

05:01.700 --> 05:03.660
Welcome to Nonnatus House.

05:04.820 --> 05:07.620
What do you suppose that is?

05:08.620 --> 05:12.979
One hears of visitors,
from realms apart from ours.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.300
I think it's an aeroplane.

05:19.780 --> 05:22.099
From the extreme
height of your heels,

05:22.100 --> 05:24.819
I deduce that you are not a nun.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.219
Are you a nun?

05:26.220 --> 05:29.219
We are the Sisters
of St Raymond Nonnatus,

05:29.220 --> 05:33.139
midwives and district nurses,
present at life's commencement

05:33.140 --> 05:34.739
and at its end.

05:34.740 --> 05:38.939
I assume you are possessed
of the appropriate credentials?

05:38.940 --> 05:42.420
I'm a trained nurse. And I've
just qualified as a midwife.

05:44.220 --> 05:48.139
The blooms upon this table
are my especial care.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.059
Dear St Raymond Nonnatus,

05:52.060 --> 05:55.620
happy survivor of Caesarean section.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.540
I feel we are prompted
to go in search of cake.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.980
They think they can conceal
things from me.

06:08.940 --> 06:11.540
But they are not sharp enough.

06:13.020 --> 06:17.219
I, you see,
am attuned to feel vibrations.

06:17.220 --> 06:22.260
Only last week, I found a Battenburg
hidden inside a Rinso box.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.299
You must have another slice.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.779
I'm almost full.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.459
You are young...
you can never be filled.

06:47.460 --> 06:50.060
You have an appetite for life.

07:03.780 --> 07:09.499
Hello. You must be Nurse Lee.
I'm Sister Julienne.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.979
This is Nurse Miller
and Nurse Franklin,

07:13.980 --> 07:15.499
who will be your colleagues.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.940
Hello. Pleased to meet you.

07:16.941 --> 07:19.259
Actually, pleased doesn't
fully cover it.

07:19.260 --> 07:22.059
We're perfectly thrilled
to have some reinforcements!

07:22.060 --> 07:25.219
I'm sorry we're late,
clinic was busy.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.099
I see you've already met
Sister Monica Joan.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.139
Yes, I have.

07:29.140 --> 07:32.019
We'll take care
of the formalities later.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.299
I'm sure that first
you'd like some tea and cake.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.380
I think you'll find,
Sister Julienne, there is no cake!

07:39.460 --> 07:42.700
Sister Evangelina,
may I introduce Nurse Lee?

07:45.060 --> 07:47.739
There is nothing in this pot
but crumbs!

07:47.740 --> 07:50.099
But Mrs B made one this morning!

07:50.100 --> 07:53.499
I saw her when I came in
from my delivery in Mitre Street!

07:53.500 --> 07:57.219
I know she did! It was coconut, which
is a very insinuating ingredient,

07:57.220 --> 08:00.499
liable to smear itself
all over the consumer's face!

08:00.500 --> 08:04.419
Are you talking to me?
You must calm yourself, my dear.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.459
You are turning quite scarlet.

08:07.460 --> 08:10.299
Our newcomer was hungry.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.379
Nurse Franklin, go into the kitchen.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.539
You might seek out
something else to eat.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.899
I seem to recall
a packet of Gypsy Creams.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.059
Let's hope Mrs B has put
a lock on the tin!

08:20.060 --> 08:23.980
I bet the newcomer had one slice
and you ate all the rest!

08:25.580 --> 08:28.059
If I were a dog,
she would not be satisfied

08:28.060 --> 08:31.739
until I had slunk beneath the table
with my tail between my legs.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.099
How you all foam and fret.

08:34.100 --> 08:39.700
I shall retire to my chamber
and see you all at Compline.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.180
Come in.

08:57.660 --> 09:00.539
Sister Monica Joan
was one of the first midwives

09:00.540 --> 09:02.179
to qualify in England.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.179
Her family did not
approve of her career choice,

09:05.180 --> 09:09.139
nor did they support
her entry into religious life.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.699
It is our privilege to care for her.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.260
I see...

09:14.300 --> 09:15.900
It's just...

09:17.620 --> 09:20.979
I ate at least four
slices of that cake,

09:20.980 --> 09:23.819
and I didn't realise
I was coming to a convent.

09:23.820 --> 09:27.299
Dear!
Did you get a dreadful fright?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.620
I thought it was a small
private hospital.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.739
Well, I do hope you won't run away!

09:33.740 --> 09:35.339
Do you have a faith, Nurse Lee?

09:35.340 --> 09:38.699
Not really. I'm Church of England.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.019
We're Anglican, too.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.419
The way you worship
is your own affair.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.979
We wear the habit,
you wear your uniform.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.979
But we are all nurses first,
and midwives foremost.

09:48.980 --> 09:53.139
I'm just back from Mrs Driscoll.
Baby's turned, no longer breech!

09:53.140 --> 09:56.499
Sister Bernadette,
this is Nurse Lee. Greetings!

09:56.500 --> 09:59.019
She's only in early
first-stage labour,

09:59.020 --> 10:01.539
so I gave her chloral hydrate
and left her to sleep.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.860
Thank you, Sister. Do try and get
some rest. I'll see to these first.

10:06.740 --> 10:10.619
I can never down tools till I'm all
set up and ready to go again!

10:10.620 --> 10:14.019
Now, a maternity box is sent to
the mother's home

10:14.020 --> 10:15.739
two weeks before the due date.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.339
These are the tools you will carry
yourself.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.539
Tin box for soap and nailbrush.

10:21.540 --> 10:26.179
Canvas case, containing scissors,
dressings, forceps.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.620
Do continue.

10:29.060 --> 10:32.300
Gauze, sterile. Gauze, idioform.

10:33.860 --> 10:38.939
Pinard. Enema funnel. Enema syringe.

10:38.940 --> 10:42.779
Rectal tube... Glass?

10:42.780 --> 10:47.420
And second rectal tube in case
the first one breaks. Also glass.

10:48.980 --> 10:52.499
You are charged with this now.
Guard it well.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.540
And we will make no further
mention of the cake.

11:19.820 --> 11:24.539
Are you all right? Yes!

11:24.540 --> 11:27.140
Glorious day.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.300
Mrs Warren?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.900
Mrs Warren?

12:01.900 --> 12:05.339
Hello?

12:16.460 --> 12:18.020
Hello?

12:34.580 --> 12:38.579
I'm looking for Mrs Warren.

12:38.580 --> 12:41.820
Mama! Es la matrona.

12:45.860 --> 12:48.459
Bienvenido en mi casa.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.579
I'm awfully sorry, I'm afraid
I don't speak Spanish, Mrs Warren.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.500
She's saying "Welcome to our
home."

12:53.501 --> 12:55.780
It's all right. She knows the drill.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.659
How many previous pregnancies have
you had, Mrs Warren?

13:01.660 --> 13:06.219
Cuantos? Veintidos embarazos,
pero veinticuatro ninos.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.819
Twenty-two pregnancies, but she had
two sets of twins.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.419
There's twenty-four of us
altogether.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.620
Twenty-four? But you've hardly got
any stretch marks!

13:14.621 --> 13:17.339
I don't know the word for that
so I can't translate it.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.859
I'll need to ask your mother
some questions,

13:19.860 --> 13:21.140
so we can establish dates.

13:21.141 --> 13:23.339
When did you last have a
period, Mrs Warren?

13:23.340 --> 13:24.900
I can't ask her that, she's my mum!

13:26.420 --> 13:31.019
How are you darling, all right?
Dad! Is that you?

13:31.020 --> 13:35.299
The nurse is here and she's asking
really embarrassing questions!

13:35.300 --> 13:38.219
Well, come down here and see to
Denise.

13:38.220 --> 13:41.980
She needs her drawers changing,
don't you, my little dove?

13:44.660 --> 13:46.140
You behave yourself.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.820
Let's sort you out, shall we?
I reckon she's new.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.059
Mi Len.

13:55.060 --> 14:00.379
You're even lovelier than when you
first got up this morning.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.899
I'm afraid I need to ask your wife
some questions

14:02.900 --> 14:04.739
of a personal nature, Mr Warren.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.820
Do you need to know about her
periods?

14:08.860 --> 14:11.899
Well... yes. I do.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.979
Well, she ain't had none of them in
years.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.300
She's had all the babies one after
the other.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.979
When do you reckon it's due, then?

14:22.980 --> 14:25.419
Twelve or thirteen weeks,
I think.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.180
Well, don't let us
hold you up, Nurse.

14:27.181 --> 14:28.939
That's all we need to know.

14:28.940 --> 14:31.219
This is a booking-in visit.

14:31.220 --> 14:34.619
I'm supposed to advise the expectant
mother on diet

14:34.620 --> 14:36.779
and hygiene in the home.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.579
I've got some leaflets.

14:38.580 --> 14:39.940
Don't you worry about us, Nurse.

14:39.941 --> 14:42.899
We've had twenty-four babies,
haven't we?

14:42.900 --> 14:45.180
We ain't never lost one yet.

14:50.020 --> 14:53.659
I didn't know where to turn,
or how to take my leave...

14:53.660 --> 14:55.260
they seemed completely unconcerned!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.459
About the pregnancy, or the mess?

14:57.460 --> 15:00.659
The pregnancy and the mess! They
only had eyes for each other.

15:00.660 --> 15:03.099
Exactly. And look where it's got
them.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.539
And how can anyone have twenty-four
children and still look so young?

15:06.540 --> 15:09.499
Now you've opened a lovely
jar of worms.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.539
Because she was fourteen
when she had her first!

15:11.540 --> 15:13.499
She may even have been younger.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.978
Mr Warren brought her
back from the Spanish Civil War.

15:15.979 --> 15:17.980
Most men would be happy with some
enemy binoculars.

15:17.981 --> 15:21.859
She was his beaker
full of the warm South.

15:21.860 --> 15:24.780
"With beaded bubbles
winking at the brim."

15:25.940 --> 15:31.859
I know not why you seek to scorn me,
I am merely quoting Keats.

15:31.860 --> 15:35.139
I delivered Conchita's last little
girl. And do you know,

15:35.140 --> 15:36.939
Mr Warren never left her side?

15:36.940 --> 15:39.019
What? A father stayed in the room?

15:39.020 --> 15:41.739
If I was a policeman
I would ask questions.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.219
A policeman did ask questions.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.939
She was of interest to us when she
disembarked at Tilbury.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.939
But the Rector wanted them married,

15:48.940 --> 15:54.260
so every legal obstacle was
simply waved away.

15:55.820 --> 16:02.139
See? I am not deemed capable of
coherent recollection.

16:02.140 --> 16:05.379
But some things are etched
upon my membrane,

16:05.380 --> 16:11.780
they are preserved like...
like watermarks on vellum.

16:14.220 --> 16:16.899
Come on. Stir your stumps.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.020
I'm first call and you're coming
with me.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.939
There are between eighty

16:29.940 --> 16:33.379
and one hundred babies born each
month in Poplar.

16:33.380 --> 16:38.259
Soon as one vacates its pram,
another one takes its place!

16:38.260 --> 16:41.339
And thus it was and ever shall be,

16:41.340 --> 16:46.859
until such time as they invent
a magic potion to put a stop to it.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.579
Sister Evangelina.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.260
Afternoon!

16:59.260 --> 17:01.260
Midwives!

17:02.580 --> 17:04.339
She's upstairs in bed.

17:04.339 --> 17:08.220
The pains are every ten minutes,
and I've got the hot water on.

17:11.220 --> 17:13.219
Cup of tea, Sister Evangelina?

17:13.220 --> 17:14.338
We shall have one apiece,

17:14.339 --> 17:16.500
and put some extra condensed milk in
Nurse Lee's.

17:16.501 --> 17:19.098
She's very junior and needs to keep
her strength up.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.419
That is, unless you've any cake.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.019
Peg, go down to the shops
and fetch some Devon Splits.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.819
Fresh cream or artificial?

17:25.819 --> 17:27.739
Can I have a bottle of pale ale?

17:27.740 --> 17:30.339
Don't you push your luck.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.019
Cheeky beggar!

17:32.020 --> 17:37.899
You, me, your mother, Nurse Lee.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.259
Anybody else coming up those stairs
will have me to answer to.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.819
Thanks.

17:42.820 --> 17:47.499
My sister's come over, and then
my friend Dot, and my Auntie Peg!

17:47.500 --> 17:52.340
She's brought some cod, for me
to have afterwards. I hate cod.

17:53.380 --> 17:58.899
I have prepared the razor.
Nurse Lee will give you a shave.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.499
I did it myself, this morning.
After I had the show.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.979
You shaved yourself?

18:03.980 --> 18:06.939
I know the drill, Sister.
This is my fourth!

18:06.940 --> 18:09.459
I suppose you gave yourself
an enema to boot?

18:09.460 --> 18:12.899
I don't want an enema.
It's not dignified!

18:12.900 --> 18:16.459
If you were that keen on your
dignity, you wouldn't be here now.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.860
Blasted chimney.

18:21.220 --> 18:25.659
High, hot and a hell of a lot!

18:25.660 --> 18:28.380
I hope you're ready with that po.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.860
Excuse me, Nurse.
Is that the afterbirth?

18:40.980 --> 18:42.699
No. Baby isn't here yet.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.699
Fair enough.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.659
Only when you're done and dusted,

18:47.660 --> 18:50.459
I'd like the afterbirth to
take down the allotment.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.500
Brings my tomatoes on lovely.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.579
I'm too tired for all of this!

18:58.580 --> 19:03.459
Come on, Muriel. Where's all that
fighting talk? No cod, no enemas.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.459
No Eddy. I meant it about Eddy!

19:05.460 --> 19:08.059
Don't you go pulling
a fast one on me!

19:08.060 --> 19:11.139
Muriel, no father has ever been
allowed in one of my delivery rooms

19:11.140 --> 19:13.220
and no father ever shall be.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.139
And there go the waters!

19:27.140 --> 19:30.539
Splendid. Nurse Lee,
we will change the bed.

19:30.540 --> 19:35.539
No, stay where you are, Nurse Lee
and I will roll you.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.339
That's it.

19:37.340 --> 19:42.100
I'm fed up with having babies,
I'm only twenty-three!

19:45.220 --> 19:47.299
There's newspaper under here!

19:47.300 --> 19:51.979
Well, saves on laundry and lets
the mattress live another day.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.859
You're not in a hospital now, with
cupboards full of spotless linen.

19:54.860 --> 19:59.139
Come on. It's quicker to do it
myself!

19:59.140 --> 20:01.819
Look, get rid of that.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.739
And sort that fire out,
it's not drawing properly.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.099
Yes, Sister.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.579
Nurse Lee?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.699
Yes? You stick with me, love.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.540
I'm an old hand.

20:23.100 --> 20:27.180
Well done, you. Well done.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.140
I can see the baby's head!

20:35.700 --> 20:39.699
We're going to turn you
onto your side, into the correct

20:39.700 --> 20:44.740
position for delivery, and then
I want you to listen to Nurse Lee.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.220
That's the way.

20:51.020 --> 20:54.859
Excellent! Right knee tucked
up under the chin.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.779
That's it. Good girl.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.580
See how it all comes flooding back!

21:10.900 --> 21:14.379
Little push now, Muriel.
Little push...

21:14.380 --> 21:15.740
don't push too hard...

21:22.780 --> 21:25.219
And that's it! The head is born.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.619
Is it nearly here?

21:26.620 --> 21:27.779
Yes. It is.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.099
You're almost done.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.659
Well done.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.659
Well done.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.900
Well done, well done.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.140
And that's it!

21:43.180 --> 21:44.860
You have a little boy!

21:48.500 --> 21:51.660
I'm that proud of you,
I could burst!

22:01.300 --> 22:03.259
What's happening?

22:03.260 --> 22:05.740
I'll swing for that bleedin' sweep!

22:14.460 --> 22:17.940
Is he all right? Is he all right?

22:24.580 --> 22:27.140
Baby's in fine fettle.
He's fast asleep.

22:32.380 --> 22:36.019
I meanwhile am lathered in soot,
right down to my drawers.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.819
Me too.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.420
I haven't got any on!

22:42.020 --> 22:45.099
We need to clamp
and cut the cord, Nurse Lee.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.459
Why the delay?
I'm sorry. Come along.

22:47.460 --> 22:50.580
Sometimes we need to deal with what
the Lord has sent us.

22:58.060 --> 23:02.660
You must be back first thing in the
morning, to do the routine checks.

23:04.420 --> 23:07.260
I'll wait for you
by the West Ferry Bridge.

23:20.020 --> 23:23.300
Mr G! All right, Sister?

23:25.740 --> 23:29.179
Bravo! All pink and white again.

23:29.180 --> 23:34.619
Still, they always say
soot is good, clean dirt.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.538
The soot was the least of my
worries!

23:36.539 --> 23:38.460
I've never seen conditions like it.

23:38.461 --> 23:43.699
Quite! The first time I saw an East
End bathroom, I actually shook.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.020
Bathroom? You were lucky!

23:45.021 --> 23:47.379
Little did I know!

23:47.380 --> 23:50.059
I mean, tap on the tenement landing,
some of them.

23:50.060 --> 23:54.699
Sister Evangelina never turns
a hair, she grew up very poor.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.259
Somewhere near Reading.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.579
Are you decent? We're all in our
unmentionables,

24:00.580 --> 24:02.579
the sight will make your day.

24:02.580 --> 24:05.659
This is Fred, our handyman.

24:05.660 --> 24:09.779
You won't be able to resist his
charm. Good day off yesterday?

24:09.780 --> 24:12.299
I've had better.

24:12.300 --> 24:15.060
Do you like toffee apples?

24:18.220 --> 24:19.619
Not really.

24:19.620 --> 24:23.379
I'm thinking of going
into toffee apples.

24:23.380 --> 24:27.099
Fred has a wide range of sidelines,
some of which are actually legal.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.939
You can keep your aspersions to
yourself, young madam.

24:30.940 --> 24:35.619
I'm not complaining. We thoroughly
enjoyed your alcoholic ginger beer.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.179
It was just a shame you sold
some to those children.

24:38.180 --> 24:42.379
There's no point in discussing it,
for you cannot understand.

24:42.380 --> 24:47.140
Brewing is a science.
There was error of exactitude.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.740
Cigarette?

24:53.260 --> 24:56.779
You really do have the most
lovely hands.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.259
Do you play the piano?

24:58.260 --> 24:59.740
I've played since I was tiny

24:59.741 --> 25:02.419
but nursing doesn't leave
much room for practice.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.419
No.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.819
I have this fantasy
about painting my nails.

25:06.820 --> 25:10.699
Cherry-red talons,
gleaming in the light.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.739
One day, I won't be able to
resist it any longer.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.539
I'll chuck out my rubber gloves,
the carbolic soap

25:16.540 --> 25:18.539
and that infernal nailbrush.

25:18.540 --> 25:22.539
Trade it all in for lashings
of Atrixo and a proper manicure.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.579
But not yet?

25:24.580 --> 25:28.060
Absolutely not yet.
There's work to be done.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.820
I can still smell cabbage from
the Pensioners' Luncheon Club.

26:13.821 --> 26:16.179
One week we were weighing babies

26:16.180 --> 26:19.539
and there was still an old man in
the corner finishing off his mince.

26:19.540 --> 26:24.300
Not to mention Madame Enid's dancing
class comes in at half past five.

26:26.260 --> 26:30.259
Excellent! Aspirin.
Why, have you got a headache?

26:30.260 --> 26:33.940
No, I've lost a button
off my suspender belt.

26:36.580 --> 26:39.899
I ought to get garters, really,
like the nuns.

26:39.900 --> 26:44.500
I've seen them in the laundry room,
drying. Quite vile.

27:33.460 --> 27:37.299
Have you come to see Mum?
We're about to have our tea.

27:39.340 --> 27:42.139
All right then, kids.
What are we going to have tonight?

27:42.140 --> 27:44.979
How about a lovely
boiled pillow case?

27:44.980 --> 27:48.419
- No!
- I fancy some fried pyjama bottoms.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.979
No, we had pyjama bottoms
last night.

27:50.980 --> 27:53.139
I'm hoping it's underpant soup.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.139
We had that last night!

27:55.140 --> 27:59.539
Vamos, Mama! Estamos con hambre!

27:59.540 --> 28:03.979
Abracadabra. Ole!

28:03.980 --> 28:06.259
Not stew and dumplings again!

28:06.260 --> 28:09.339
Nurse, you going to join us, look?

28:26.980 --> 28:29.419
Coma. Coma.

28:29.420 --> 28:32.340
She says, "Eat up. Eat up."
Do as you're told.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.899
There are no plates.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.180
We never use them. Tuck in, Nurse!

28:58.940 --> 29:00.939
Cor, that don't half
pen and ink, nurse.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.819
I don't know why you're bothering.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.499
Conchita's ankles are swollen.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.219
When that happens we have to check for
a condition called pre-eclampsia,

29:08.220 --> 29:10.539
by looking for signs
of protein in the urine.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.299
Pre-eclampsia?
Is that the same as toxaemia?

29:13.300 --> 29:14.819
Yes. It is.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.699
Well, then you ain't got
to bother with the test, Nurse.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.800
Sister Bernadette
says you can't get

29:19.801 --> 29:21.899
toxaemia except with
your first and second.

29:21.900 --> 29:25.299
We're on our 25th.
Conchita's ankles are swollen.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.259
Well, Sister Bernadette
used to say that it was

29:28.260 --> 29:29.979
cos she was on her feet.

29:29.980 --> 29:34.539
Perhaps you could persuade Conchita to
lie down for an hour or so each day,

29:34.540 --> 29:36.299
with her legs slightly elevated.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.539
I'll tell Maureen to tell her.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.699
I take my hat off to the kids.
I mean, even the nippers can do it.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.100
I was never much good
with the foreign lingo.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.979
You don't speak Spanish?

29:47.980 --> 29:50.419
No, there's never no need, no.

29:50.420 --> 29:53.340
Conchita and me,
we understand each other.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.060
Mrs Merrick!

31:03.060 --> 31:04.299
Hello, Muriel.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.860
Hello, Pearl. Long time no see.

31:07.940 --> 31:11.099
I've just come in for my check-up.
He's my fourth.

31:11.100 --> 31:15.740
That's a lovely hat, you can pass it
my way once his head gets too big.

31:17.740 --> 31:20.420
Your youngest's just weed
on the floor.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.338
Yeah, I know.
We're toilet-training him

31:25.339 --> 31:27.700
but it's all right,
he ain't got no pants to wet.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.260
Mrs Winston.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.540
Keep an eye on them for me,
will you?

31:54.100 --> 31:58.219
First lie down I've had all day.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.579
I see you're 32 weeks pregnant.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.579
I shall need you to do a urine
sample for me.

32:02.580 --> 32:07.139
Can't you just examine me first?
I've only just got comfy.

32:07.140 --> 32:11.340
I keep having twinges, on and off.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.339
Well, let's take a look at you,
shall we?

32:17.340 --> 32:19.940
I've got some shocking discharge.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.460
Heels to bottom,
knees nice and wide apart.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.979
Are you aware of this?

32:45.980 --> 32:49.499
Little lump in my downbelows?
Yeah, it's been there a while.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.940
I can't really reach it now.

32:53.660 --> 32:57.060
Your face! You reckon I've got
a dose, don't you?

32:58.100 --> 33:03.700
I'll have to... check
with someone more senior.

33:07.740 --> 33:12.259
I'm afraid the lump in her vulva
appears to be a syphilitic chancre.

33:12.260 --> 33:16.699
Other symptoms support
the diagnosis.

33:16.700 --> 33:20.700
And of course the foetus is at risk.
Dr Turner is already on his way.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.299
I imagine he will prescribe
a course of penicillin.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.020
Nurse?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.779
You won't catch anything.

33:31.780 --> 33:34.379
How could she not have known?

33:34.380 --> 33:37.580
How could she have felt that thing
and never cared?

33:38.980 --> 33:41.859
Pearl Winston
isn't accustomed to caring.

33:41.860 --> 33:45.540
Or, indeed, being cared about.
How can you be so calm?

33:47.260 --> 33:50.539
When I was new to district practice,

33:50.540 --> 33:53.980
I often found it hard to
conquer my revulsion.

34:01.580 --> 34:05.820
I'm sorry. I didn't know
people lived like this.

34:06.980 --> 34:08.420
But they do.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.860
And it's why we're here.

34:42.340 --> 34:46.420
Tea's on its way!
You look as though you need a cup.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.659
Can I smell smog?

34:50.659 --> 34:53.539
There's a mist closing in.

34:53.540 --> 34:57.739
It's coming up off the river.
And that ain't an encouraging sign.

34:57.740 --> 35:00.780
Temperature out there's
dropping like a stone.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.699
No good looking in there.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.660
There was a cherry sponge
but guess who's had it.

35:29.060 --> 35:33.659
There is frost fingering its way
beneath the door into the hall.

35:33.660 --> 35:36.259
You must take
these into bed with you.

35:36.260 --> 35:41.419
You are young, you see, and your
vibrations will stimulate the corms.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.419
They were mistaken into thinking
spring had come.

35:44.420 --> 35:47.459
I am very much
afraid that they will die.

35:47.460 --> 35:51.259
And the demise of something barely
born goes against

35:51.260 --> 35:53.300
the sacred nature of our calling.

35:59.020 --> 36:00.660
Sister Monica Joan?

36:02.660 --> 36:04.700
What about the bowl?

36:06.220 --> 36:07.500
But it would be missed.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.620
By Sister Evangelina!

36:11.980 --> 36:15.580
I am sure we do not wish to
unleash the beast.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.059
Dr Turner wanted you to start
the injections straightaway.

37:05.060 --> 37:08.979
He'll need to see your husband, too, and
arrange the same treatments for him.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.660
Where are you going to put
the needle? Leg or arse?

37:12.820 --> 37:14.980
In your bottom, I'm afraid.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.539
I should have been a stripper!

37:28.540 --> 37:31.140
I mean, at least I'd have met
a better class of man.

38:18.980 --> 38:23.139
Mum? Mama? Mama?

38:23.140 --> 38:24.579
Mum!

38:24.580 --> 38:26.060
Mum!

38:27.260 --> 38:30.139
Help! Mum!

38:30.140 --> 38:31.580
Help!

38:54.780 --> 38:56.420
Room service!

38:58.860 --> 39:01.859
Strictly entre nous,
I could murder a Dubonnet.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.900
But we're both on call,
so Horlicks is our lot.

39:07.340 --> 39:09.939
Did you find it hard,
when you first came here?

39:09.940 --> 39:14.659
I thought I deserved all manner
of medals! Up all night.

39:14.660 --> 39:18.180
Cycling for miles. A wall of wimples
at every single meal time.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.059
And then one day I realised.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.419
I didn't deserve any medals at all.

39:25.420 --> 39:27.859
The mothers are the brave ones.

39:27.860 --> 39:32.979
Baby after baby, in abominable
conditions, and they keep on going.

39:32.980 --> 39:37.020
They're the heroines.
I'm just here to help.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.940
You will find your feet.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.779
You ought to come out with Cynthia
and I.

39:43.780 --> 39:47.379
They have these tremendous dances,
down at the church hall.

39:47.380 --> 39:50.620
Unless, of course,
you already have a chap.

39:52.020 --> 39:55.019
No. Do you?

39:55.020 --> 39:56.539
What? Have a chap?

39:56.540 --> 40:00.579
Well, I used to go out with
this curate called Roger.

40:00.580 --> 40:03.539
But he couldn't be seen in
the parish with a woman on his arm.

40:03.540 --> 40:06.060
We had to catch separate
buses all the way to

40:06.061 --> 40:08.579
Monument before we were even
permitted to hold hands.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.380
I can't tell you how tedious it was!

40:12.660 --> 40:16.220
I thought you might be pining after
some beastly absentee boyfriend.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.179
No.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.780
Are you sure?

40:23.580 --> 40:26.899
There's a look about you,
that's all.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.460
A look that only the lovelorn have.

40:35.020 --> 40:37.100
I've loved someone since I was 17.

40:38.540 --> 40:40.820
But I can't have him.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.900
And I can't give him up.

40:47.180 --> 40:52.420
So until I can do that,
no-one else will stand a chance.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.939
Nonnatus House. Nurse Lee speaking.

41:04.940 --> 41:10.500
Conchita took a tumble in the yard.
We think she's got concussion.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.100
Mr Warren, you should call
the doctor, not a midwife!

41:16.500 --> 41:18.980
No, we keep calling
but we can't get any answer.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.419
Can you get her to a hospital?

41:22.420 --> 41:25.260
No, you can't see
hand in front of your face out here.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.779
'It's you we need now, not him.'

41:28.780 --> 41:30.660
She's in labour.

41:31.980 --> 41:35.059
Waters are still intact. The pains
are about every five minutes.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.259
Mr Warren must know labour
when he sees it.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.440
The birth won't be
remarkable, but such a

41:39.441 --> 41:41.619
premature baby is unlikely
to survive, even if

41:41.620 --> 41:44.180
the ambulance arrives on time.
Has it been sent for?

41:44.181 --> 41:46.739
The obstetrics flying
squad are on their way.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.579
Dr Turner will meet you
at the house.

41:49.580 --> 41:52.340
Have you delivered
a stillborn baby before?

41:54.260 --> 41:57.539
In training. Under supervision.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.339
I should go with her.

41:59.340 --> 42:01.819
No. I have a complex case to go to,

42:01.820 --> 42:04.260
and who knows what else the night
might bring?

42:10.420 --> 42:12.019
Worst fog in five years.

42:12.020 --> 42:13.820
Hurry up, it's a bit of a step.

42:15.740 --> 42:16.860
Come on, Nurse.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.300
You'll be all right.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.260
God be with you.

42:29.740 --> 42:30.780
Good luck.

42:58.780 --> 43:00.219
You still there, Nurse?

43:00.220 --> 43:02.099
Just about.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.500
Not far now.

43:13.140 --> 43:15.899
She never screams like this!
She always keeps her head!

43:15.900 --> 43:18.579
Has the doctor not arrived yet? No.

43:18.580 --> 43:21.180
We ain't never lost one before,
Nurse.

43:23.500 --> 43:26.460
Sometimes we have to deal
with what the Lord has sent us.

43:37.220 --> 43:38.260
All right.

43:43.821 --> 43:47.339
The concussion is preventing her
from recognising the pain as labour.

43:47.340 --> 43:50.859
She doesn't know what's happening,
she's too scared to co-operate.

43:50.860 --> 43:53.979
All right, my love.
We'll soon be done. I promise you.

43:53.980 --> 43:56.139
I don't think it will be long now.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.100
The urge to push will
overtake her, whether

43:58.101 --> 44:00.059
she knows what's
happening or not.

44:00.060 --> 44:01.659
You need to be prepared.

44:01.660 --> 44:03.659
How easily will it come away?

44:06.781 --> 44:08.739
I wish the ambulance would come!

44:08.740 --> 44:11.939
If you come with me, Maureen,
help get your mum onto her side.

44:32.260 --> 44:34.660
Get me the bowl, please, Maureen.

44:37.180 --> 44:41.540
I've got you, my darling.
I've got you. I've got you.

44:55.660 --> 45:01.780
You can go downstairs for me now,
Maureen, boil me some water, please.

45:17.820 --> 45:22.220
Don't ask me if she's all right
because I don't know.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.340
Well, she's gone limp.

45:40.780 --> 45:43.060
She's going into shock.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.260
We need to keep her warm.

45:50.261 --> 45:54.059
We don't know when help will arrive,
and she's still losing blood.

45:54.060 --> 45:56.980
You're doing perfect, my darling.
You are doing perfect.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.060
It's even weaker.

46:03.860 --> 46:05.859
Bebe?

46:05.860 --> 46:08.700
No bebe. Not this time,
my beautiful.

46:29.140 --> 46:31.299
It's alive, Nurse!

46:31.300 --> 46:33.499
I didn't wrap him up!
He'll be so cold.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.980
Wrap him now!

46:39.860 --> 46:43.219
It's a little boy.
Come on, little one, come on.

46:45.140 --> 46:49.340
Come on, little one, come on.

46:50.580 --> 46:51.979
What's happened?

46:51.980 --> 46:53.820
You've got another brother.

46:55.540 --> 46:59.019
He's smaller than a doll.
How's he still alive?

46:59.020 --> 47:00.459
I don't know.

47:00.460 --> 47:03.659
Me nino. Donde esta mi nino?

47:03.660 --> 47:07.019
She's saying "My baby.
Where's my baby?"

47:07.020 --> 47:10.739
El esta acqui.
La matrona se le ha secado.

47:10.740 --> 47:14.419
I said he's here.
I said you were just drying him.

47:14.420 --> 47:17.899
You must tell her that it's
very small and fragile.

47:17.900 --> 47:21.540
Es muy pequeno. Muy fragil.
Todos los ninos son fragiles.

47:23.020 --> 47:25.180
She says, "All babies are fragile."

47:32.220 --> 47:34.459
No... No.
What's up? Tell me what to do.

47:34.460 --> 47:38.539
She needs ergometrin.
What's that?

47:38.540 --> 47:42.659
Straight upstairs.
Mind out the road, kids.

47:42.660 --> 47:45.740
The children are to stay
out of the way.

47:51.100 --> 47:54.219
0.5 ccs of ergometrin. Second dose.
What happens now, Nurse?

47:54.220 --> 47:58.139
We need the rest of the afterbirth to
come away, or she might need surgery.

47:58.140 --> 48:01.819
She ain't never been to hospital,
she's had all 25 of them at home! 25?

48:01.820 --> 48:06.379
If you value her life,
you will let us do what's best.

48:06.380 --> 48:09.259
The name's Turner, patient's GP.
Sorry, I was delayed.

48:09.260 --> 48:12.299
Three bronchitis patients,
one after the other.

48:12.300 --> 48:15.779
We, meanwhile, have a haemorrhaging
mother. And a viable neonate.

48:15.780 --> 48:19.339
This young midwife's been very
capable. Well done. Can I help?

48:19.340 --> 48:20.859
Take over on the oxygen.

48:20.860 --> 48:24.339
Call Great Ormond Street, tell them
to prepare for a 30-weeker. Yes, sir.

48:24.340 --> 48:26.899
And you can bring
the ventilator from the ambulance.

48:26.900 --> 48:28.939
Ventilator? Great Ormond Street?

48:28.940 --> 48:31.299
He needs help.
He might need to be tube fed.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.219
That's it, it's out! Check it.

48:33.220 --> 48:36.059
Lips pinking up.
And the baby's still breathing.

48:36.060 --> 48:39.779
Thank God. I'm all for giving
medals to the gentleman upstairs, sir,

48:39.780 --> 48:42.899
but in this case credit should go to
the National Health.

48:42.900 --> 48:45.819
Ten years ago we would have
had none of this.

48:45.820 --> 48:48.499
No obstetric flying squad,
no ambulance. No chance.

48:48.500 --> 48:52.339
Placenta's complete, sir!
Stabilising.

48:52.340 --> 48:55.459
She'll need a further transfusion,
but we can do that here.

48:55.460 --> 48:58.459
Right, let's take this little chap,
get him sorted out.

48:58.460 --> 49:01.499
No. Maureen, tell her!
He's got to go to hospital!

49:01.500 --> 49:04.099
Mama, el para estar en el hopital.
No!

49:04.100 --> 49:07.139
El necesita! Morira. Morira.

49:07.140 --> 49:11.539
I said he'll die. He'll die.
Morira, Mama!

49:11.540 --> 49:13.579
Se queda conmingo.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.499
She says, "He stays with me."

49:15.500 --> 49:18.019
Tell her she needs blood, penicillin
and rest at home,

49:18.020 --> 49:22.499
the baby will be treated in the finest
children's hospital in England.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.260
Mama, necesita sangre, e...
Se queda conmingo!

49:28.980 --> 49:32.220
Yu soy su hopital. El is mi sangre.

49:35.860 --> 49:37.619
She says, "He stays with me.

49:37.620 --> 49:40.420
"I am his hospital. He is my blood."

49:43.660 --> 49:46.460
No morira.

49:50.180 --> 49:51.220
No. No morira.

52:46.740 --> 52:48.299
May we come in?

52:48.300 --> 52:51.019
Yeah, you're just in time
to see him take his milk.

52:51.020 --> 52:54.059
You wait till you see
his little tongue come out.

52:54.060 --> 52:56.379
Ain't no bigger than a daisy petal.

52:58.540 --> 53:03.259
What is that? That's something
Maureen uses in Domestic Science.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.260
She says it's an icing rod.

53:10.620 --> 53:13.020
How often has he been fed?

53:13.021 --> 53:15.419
Every half an hour since
seven o'clock this morning.

53:15.420 --> 53:18.499
Six or eight drops, he has.
Just sort of licks them down.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.700
Then she tucks him back
in her nightie.

53:23.140 --> 53:26.220
We have no experience
of caring for such babies.

53:27.780 --> 53:30.339
In the olden days,
they did not live.

53:30.340 --> 53:33.660
And now, they're nursed
in a hospital.

53:34.660 --> 53:36.660
Not this one.

53:51.340 --> 53:55.019
We won't send the baby to hospital,
will we, Sister? No.

53:55.020 --> 53:58.899
We'll visit three times a day
for the first six weeks

53:58.900 --> 54:02.059
and then every day
for as long as is required.

54:02.060 --> 54:05.499
Only time will tell
whether Conchita will succeed.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.380
We must see what love can do.

54:23.580 --> 54:27.179
It frightens me, seeing him
without his little nightie on.

54:27.180 --> 54:30.500
His ribs is that delicate,
they look like kipper bones.

54:37.820 --> 54:41.459
I seen an incubator baby
in a newsreel once.

54:41.460 --> 54:43.380
Looked like a landed fish, it did.

54:45.420 --> 54:48.979
Laying on its back,
glass all around it.

54:48.980 --> 54:51.940
It looked lonely to its marrow.

55:06.100 --> 55:10.580
He's put on two ounces,
Mr and Mrs Warren! We're on our way.

55:26.100 --> 55:30.659
Teach yourself
to be a good home laundress.

55:30.660 --> 55:33.619
Washing and ironing most things
in the home...

55:33.620 --> 55:35.580
Midwife.

55:38.380 --> 55:41.859
Follow her message and
you'll find your weekly wash...

55:41.860 --> 55:43.740
Did you hear I lost it?

55:45.020 --> 55:49.620
Yes. I did. I'm so sorry.

55:51.180 --> 55:53.020
Can't win them all?

55:57.260 --> 55:58.699
No.

55:58.700 --> 56:01.580
I'd like my milk dried up.

56:03.860 --> 56:07.140
I know.
I brought you some Epsom salts.

56:09.100 --> 56:11.819
I'll make you a cuppa.

56:11.820 --> 56:16.460
Let me do it, Pearl.
No. Got to keep going.

56:20.340 --> 56:23.979
My grandma left me this.
Mind you don't sit on that chair!

56:25.620 --> 56:27.500
The little fella weed on it.

56:31.160 --> 56:34.720
Bet you think we're all slatterns
round here, don't you?

56:36.740 --> 56:39.899
As a matter of fact,
I think you're all heroines.

56:39.900 --> 56:43.099
That concludes
our household tips for the day.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.379
Now, to our afternoon
music programme.

57:15.740 --> 57:19.459
'I had begun to see
what love could do.

57:19.460 --> 57:25.219
'Love brought life into the world
and women to their knees.

57:25.220 --> 57:29.219
'Love had the power
to break hearts and to save.

57:29.220 --> 57:34.419
'Love was, like midwifery,
the very stuff of life

57:34.420 --> 57:37.539
'and I was learning
how to fly with it.

57:37.540 --> 57:41.859
'Through all the streets,
like the river to the sea.'

57:50.666 --> 57:53.041
Camilla Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne?

57:53.221 --> 57:55.459
Yes. Yes, come in.

57:55.460 --> 57:57.459
I generally answer to Chummy.

57:57.460 --> 58:00.299
My pa used to say,
"Long dogs need short names".

58:00.300 --> 58:02.459
You CAN ride a bike?

58:02.460 --> 58:06.379
I can ride a horse. That can't be
so very different, surely?

58:06.380 --> 58:10.339
Miss? Miss? Could you change
a five-pound note for me?

58:10.340 --> 58:13.499
People like you are supposed
to help people like me.

58:13.500 --> 58:17.260
You're very afraid of something,
aren't you, Mary?

58:19.500 --> 58:21.760
It would seem, Betty,
as though your baby

58:21.761 --> 58:24.019
is presenting in the
breech position.

58:24.020 --> 58:27.664
It's coming out arse first.
It's bad.
