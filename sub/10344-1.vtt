00:41.473 --> 00:43.976
You are interested
in the unusual.

00:44.009 --> 00:46.712
The mysterious.
The unexplainable.

00:46.745 --> 00:48.781
That is why you are here.

00:48.814 --> 00:50.616
And now,
for the first time,

00:50.648 --> 00:52.817
we're going to bring
you the full story

00:52.851 --> 00:56.155
of what will happen
on that fateful day.

00:56.187 --> 00:58.656
The incidents.
The places.

00:58.690 --> 01:01.527
We cannot keep
this a secret any longer.

01:01.559 --> 01:04.129
My friend,
can your heart stand

01:04.162 --> 01:06.065
the shocking facts
about grave...

01:06.098 --> 01:07.432
cut.

01:07.465 --> 01:10.836
-Stop? Really?
-Fuck. Fuck.

01:10.869 --> 01:13.605
I gave you five perfect takes,
what do you want from me?

01:13.638 --> 01:15.140
Let's start
with talent, Criswell.

01:15.173 --> 01:16.976
Stop calling me that,
that's not my name.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.578
No, on this set,
it is your name.

01:19.611 --> 01:20.846
All right?
We talked about this.

01:20.878 --> 01:22.147
Go check your contract.

01:22.181 --> 01:24.182
Yes, my contract.

01:24.215 --> 01:25.550
Listen to me for a minute,

01:25.584 --> 01:27.453
-it could be fun...
-No.

01:27.486 --> 01:30.523
Criswell, this has been
done hundreds of times.

01:30.556 --> 01:32.524
All right, you gotta
give them something more.

01:32.557 --> 01:33.925
You gotta give them something

01:33.959 --> 01:35.828
they normally wouldn't
see in a remake.

01:35.861 --> 01:37.129
Newsflash, bubby.

01:37.161 --> 01:38.830
Remakes are overplayed.

01:38.863 --> 01:40.465
They're overdone.

01:40.498 --> 01:43.869
99.9% of them
suck donkey balls.

01:43.902 --> 01:45.537
I don't know why
anyone in their right mind

01:45.571 --> 01:46.872
would remake
this movie anyway.

01:46.905 --> 01:48.540
-It's...
-One hour till deadline.

01:52.043 --> 01:54.813
Please. Criswell...

01:54.846 --> 01:57.550
For the love of everything
that is good and holy,

01:57.583 --> 02:01.519
just please...

02:01.553 --> 02:03.923
Care.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.191
Look, this could
be your last chance

02:05.224 --> 02:06.826
in getting back on top.

02:06.858 --> 02:09.727
Let me tell you something,
you spineless dog dick.

02:09.761 --> 02:12.198
I... have fallen.

02:12.231 --> 02:13.966
My current
surroundings

02:13.999 --> 02:17.236
and present company prove this.
Get the fuck away from me.

02:17.268 --> 02:20.004
You've been in the business
all for about two days.

02:20.037 --> 02:21.840
So it's probably not clear,

02:21.874 --> 02:23.007
but have no fear.

02:23.041 --> 02:25.778
I, your Criswell,

02:25.810 --> 02:27.480
shall clarify.

02:27.512 --> 02:29.849
It's this face
that you're banking

02:29.881 --> 02:31.015
your career on.

02:31.048 --> 02:33.918
Stop pissing it off.

02:33.951 --> 02:35.620
Yes, we have the potential

02:35.654 --> 02:37.723
to become a Phoenix
from the ashes of this Turkey,

02:37.755 --> 02:38.890
but not if you're spinning me

02:38.923 --> 02:42.027
on a thousand takes.

02:42.059 --> 02:43.661
Why don't we get something...

02:43.695 --> 02:47.233
Something in the can.

02:47.266 --> 02:49.535
We'll look at it,
in the dailies,

02:49.568 --> 02:51.202
and if we'll fix it,
we'll fix it.

02:51.236 --> 02:53.037
Otherwise, I'll walk,

02:53.070 --> 02:54.906
you can find yourself
another Criswell

02:54.939 --> 02:56.908
to carry your shit.

02:56.941 --> 02:58.142
Now get behind that camera

02:58.176 --> 02:59.979
and call fucking "action."

03:06.684 --> 03:08.920
Can I get you anything else,
Mr. Criswell?

03:08.953 --> 03:10.789
A gun.

03:10.821 --> 03:12.724
20 years of my life back.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.195
Shot of rum will suffice.

03:21.332 --> 03:22.967
Are you ready,
Mr. Criswell?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.271
I was born ready,
let's shoot this fucker.

03:25.303 --> 03:26.872
Lights.

03:26.904 --> 03:28.540
Camera.

03:28.574 --> 03:29.707
Action.

03:29.741 --> 03:31.577
A greetings my friends.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.578
We're all interested
in the future.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.581
Because that is where
you and I

03:35.613 --> 03:38.884
are going to spend
the rest of our lives.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.175
Lucy,

06:16.208 --> 06:17.910
do you really have
to go to work now?

06:17.942 --> 06:19.877
Yeah, grandpa.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.913
I'm not ready
to feel it all yet.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.182
Best to keep busy.

06:23.215 --> 06:25.117
She was
so proud of you.

06:27.419 --> 06:30.089
I can't do this now.

06:30.122 --> 06:33.057
I need to forget
until I'm ready to feel.

06:33.090 --> 06:34.225
Lucy, come home.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.494
The lab needs me.

06:35.526 --> 06:37.729
I'll be home in the morning.

07:06.490 --> 07:08.259
Looks like we're
just gonna beat nightfall.

07:09.261 --> 07:10.429
Better radio it in.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.164
Yeah, Roger that.

07:13.198 --> 07:15.134
Coast to Nilbog,
come in.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.302
That you, Danny?

07:17.335 --> 07:18.904
Yeah, Mac.
It's us.

07:18.937 --> 07:20.973
Hot damn.
Welcome home, boys.

07:21.006 --> 07:22.407
How long you been out there?

07:22.439 --> 07:24.542
Months, man.
Ready to bring her in.

07:24.576 --> 07:25.910
Here that, Danny boy.

07:25.944 --> 07:28.814
There ain't
been a plane in all...

07:28.847 --> 07:29.982
for fuck's sake.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.182
My god.

07:31.215 --> 07:32.350
Jeff, the time is now.

07:32.384 --> 07:34.052
The end of my life!

07:34.085 --> 07:35.387
God.

07:42.393 --> 07:44.396
Hey, Edith. You okay?

07:44.429 --> 07:47.166
I...

07:47.199 --> 07:49.001
That'll change
your whole day.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.802
Jeff, she's...

07:50.836 --> 07:51.970
Wettish.

07:52.002 --> 07:54.473
Mac, this is
Jeff Trent.

07:54.506 --> 07:57.476
There's a large meteor
headed your way right now.

07:57.509 --> 07:59.143
What?

07:59.177 --> 08:01.412
A meteor. You have to
warn the people.

08:01.446 --> 08:03.148
Right on the show, Jeff?

08:03.180 --> 08:05.149
Look, I saw it with my own eyes.

09:02.574 --> 09:04.343
Kelton.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.377
I want you and Larry
to go out to the airport

09:06.410 --> 09:07.578
see if there's...

09:07.612 --> 09:09.146
seems to be some kinda sighting

09:09.179 --> 09:12.918
of a meteor landing
somewhere in town.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.252
Badass.

09:14.285 --> 09:16.054
You mean, you don't know
where it landed?

09:16.087 --> 09:17.890
No, it's
just a sighting.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.958
Nonetheless,

09:19.991 --> 09:23.395
Kelton, see if there's
something to it.

09:23.428 --> 09:24.563
Hey, chief.

09:24.596 --> 09:26.598
What's that?

09:28.199 --> 09:30.334
Nobody likes you, Larry.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.170
This is boss man Mike,
on the mic.

09:32.203 --> 09:34.405
Welcome back
to "The Backflash."

09:34.439 --> 09:36.574
The looking back,
looking forward show.

09:36.607 --> 09:40.178
Solid oldies,
covered by solid bands.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.146
We're gonna be broadcasted
all night long

09:42.179 --> 09:44.116
this Halloween night.

09:44.149 --> 09:47.152
Let me ask you ghouls and
goblins out there in spookville,

09:47.184 --> 09:48.319
how you doing
this Halloween night?

09:48.352 --> 09:49.487
You having a good time?

09:49.521 --> 09:51.555
Boss man Mike is.

09:51.588 --> 09:53.624
I'm gonna play you one of
my favorite ditties right now

09:53.657 --> 09:55.459
so that you can
go out and collect

09:55.492 --> 09:57.996
your treat in beats.

10:46.144 --> 10:49.247
Lucy? What are you doing here?

10:49.280 --> 10:51.183
You've had a loss
in your family,

10:51.216 --> 10:52.617
you deserve to take
some time off.

10:52.650 --> 10:56.554
No, I'd rather just work
through it, you know?

10:56.588 --> 10:59.223
Plus, I've always loved
the graveyard shift.

10:59.256 --> 11:00.224
Are you sure?

11:00.257 --> 11:02.160
Yes. I'll be fine.

11:02.193 --> 11:03.528
All right.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.530
Well, if you change
your mind.

11:05.563 --> 11:08.232
You know, you just power
things down and lock up.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.400
Thank you.

11:09.434 --> 11:10.736
And...

11:10.769 --> 11:12.738
The biolab is overflowing
with cadavers,

11:12.771 --> 11:15.607
so we're keeping this one
for Saturday's experiment.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.775
Not a problem.

11:16.808 --> 11:18.410
If he wakes up,
he can help.

11:19.676 --> 11:21.012
Enjoy your evening.

11:21.045 --> 11:23.047
See you in morn.

11:29.186 --> 11:30.588
How the hell are you, boy?

11:30.622 --> 11:31.756
-Mac!
-Man.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.259
Mac.
With the stinkies.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.293
You know.

11:36.327 --> 11:38.530
-You sure you didn't see anything?
-No, man.

11:38.563 --> 11:40.465
I throw on the radio,
nobody hit either.

11:40.497 --> 11:42.566
I called for the police,
just like you said.

11:42.599 --> 11:43.768
They should be here any sec.

11:43.801 --> 11:45.469
We definitely
saw it.

11:45.502 --> 11:47.171
Made Edith piss herself.

11:47.204 --> 11:48.339
Well...

11:48.372 --> 11:50.175
Aww.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.610
Looks like
I better go help her.

11:51.642 --> 11:54.545
It's okay, boys,
I like a wet one.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.753
This is gonna be
the greatest day ever.

12:04.122 --> 12:07.125
Jeff, you're missing it.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.292
The show.

12:11.563 --> 12:12.697
Mac...

12:12.729 --> 12:14.098
Here comes 5-0.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.236
Lovely.
You can report it.

12:18.269 --> 12:20.439
And then the sweet
embrace of alcohol.

12:20.472 --> 12:21.807
I was gonna
ask Edith to join,

12:21.839 --> 12:26.277
but I don't
really want a wet one.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.778
Jeff. Danny.

12:27.811 --> 12:29.346
Nilbog's finest.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.451
Larry, how's life
behind a shield?

12:32.483 --> 12:34.852
So you saw a meteor?

12:34.886 --> 12:36.688
Yeah. Right before we landed.

12:36.721 --> 12:38.824
You see where it hit?

12:38.857 --> 12:41.425
No.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.594
Well, I guess if there's
no point in impact...

12:43.627 --> 12:45.729
There's no sense in taking
the man power out

12:45.762 --> 12:47.098
and going out searching for it.

12:47.131 --> 12:48.599
If it did any damage,

12:48.632 --> 12:49.800
somebody will let us know.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.803
What did it look like?

12:51.835 --> 12:54.805
Like a meteor.

12:54.838 --> 12:57.309
So no description then?

12:57.342 --> 12:58.776
Listen, why don't you
go back to the station

12:58.809 --> 13:00.145
and send somebody out

13:00.178 --> 13:01.780
who's gonna take this seriously?

13:01.813 --> 13:04.616
Jeff, I know how to do my job.

13:04.649 --> 13:05.784
I seriously doubt that.

13:05.817 --> 13:07.886
All right, okay.

13:07.919 --> 13:09.453
We have your statements.

13:09.487 --> 13:11.356
We'll report to the chief.

13:11.389 --> 13:13.158
It will be in his hands now.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.758
You guys can call in
in the morning

13:14.791 --> 13:17.828
for an update,
if you'd like.

13:17.862 --> 13:19.197
Yeah.

13:19.229 --> 13:21.398
That'll be fun.

13:21.431 --> 13:25.402
Okay, great.
So we'll be on our way.

13:25.435 --> 13:27.405
Right, officer Kelton?

13:34.779 --> 13:37.149
All right.

13:37.181 --> 13:38.349
Well, then...

13:41.486 --> 13:42.888
Man, why do you gotta
hassle a guy like that?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.855
Because they make fun of us,
Larry.

13:44.889 --> 13:47.893
They're fucking city dicks.
There's no meteor out there.

13:47.925 --> 13:51.496
They just want us out in the
shit and the mud all night,

13:51.529 --> 13:54.866
while they're sitting
in some bar, laughing.

13:54.899 --> 13:57.269
Well.
So...

13:57.301 --> 13:58.736
Coming drinking
with us tonight?

13:58.770 --> 14:00.639
No. I gotta
get back to Paula.

14:00.671 --> 14:02.806
What? Why? Haven't you seen
enough of that woman yet?

14:02.839 --> 14:04.642
You've been married
for like three months.

14:04.675 --> 14:06.243
Yeah, and I've been
in the air for the last two.

14:06.276 --> 14:07.912
I'll see you
later, Dan.

14:07.945 --> 14:10.447
All right.

14:10.481 --> 14:12.617
-Ready?
-Well, Mac.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.718
Looks like it's
just you and me.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.353
Let's find out where we're
gonna go throw up tonight.

14:16.386 --> 14:17.689
Arr...

14:38.008 --> 14:39.743
Boo.

15:57.554 --> 15:58.857
How you
holding up, luce?

15:58.890 --> 16:01.393
I'm good.
You got the figures?

16:01.425 --> 16:03.527
I'm sending them right now.

16:05.463 --> 16:06.997
Listen,

16:07.030 --> 16:08.465
I'm sorry about
your grandmother.

16:08.498 --> 16:11.602
Thank you, Alice.

16:11.636 --> 16:13.704
Are these numbers right?

16:13.737 --> 16:14.872
That they are.

16:14.905 --> 16:16.040
Apparently splitting
a photon

16:16.074 --> 16:17.909
causes a much
larger reaction.

16:17.942 --> 16:19.744
This is astounding.

16:19.776 --> 16:21.078
Yeah.

16:21.112 --> 16:22.780
We're really on
to something here.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.381
But we have to keep it quiet.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.384
We have to keep it secret.

16:26.416 --> 16:27.785
If professor Robertson finds out

16:27.819 --> 16:29.587
what we're doing on the side,

16:29.620 --> 16:31.523
he'll have us both exiled
from the profession.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.590
Once we run a test,
he can do whatever he wants.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.926
We'll have all the data we need
to approach the board.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.494
You gonna run a test there?

16:37.527 --> 16:39.930
In a couple of days.

16:39.963 --> 16:43.334
Montana is very scarce.

16:43.367 --> 16:44.602
Just gotta find a locale.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.004
Don't forget to tape it.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.473
What? You have
no faith in me?

16:48.506 --> 16:49.940
None whatsoever.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.676
Shit,
head honcho's coming.

16:52.709 --> 16:55.546
I gotta go.
Stay in touch.

16:55.579 --> 16:56.948
Hey, Jimmy.

16:56.981 --> 16:58.415
Hey.

16:58.449 --> 16:59.650
You gonna talk
to them again?

16:59.684 --> 17:02.554
Yeah, just doing
our daily duty.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.588
Hey hey hey hey.

17:04.621 --> 17:06.123
Calm down.
Calm down.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.394
-Relax.
-What?

17:09.425 --> 17:10.861
Calm down. You guys
know better than this.

17:10.895 --> 17:12.128
Can't be acting up
like this all the time.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.498
We can't keep
coming out here.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.898
-Go suck an egg.
-Hey hey hey.

17:15.933 --> 17:17.434
All right, that's enough.
Where's your dad?

17:17.467 --> 17:21.070
Where's your dad?
Just get inside.

17:21.105 --> 17:23.708
He's inside? You go
show me where he is.

17:23.741 --> 17:24.876
Larry,
I wanna go home.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.042
Just come on.

17:26.077 --> 17:27.444
I just...
I wanna go home.

17:28.812 --> 17:30.748
Hey.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.586
You okay, squirt?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.521
Yeah.

17:36.553 --> 17:39.690
When you fall, you
don't have to be scared.

17:39.723 --> 17:41.092
What?

17:45.596 --> 17:47.065
Your boys
are causing

17:47.098 --> 17:49.901
quite a ruckus
again, Jamie.

17:49.934 --> 17:51.502
I'll talk to them.

17:51.536 --> 17:53.071
Yeah, but do you think
maybe you could

17:53.104 --> 17:55.473
talk some sense
into them this time.

17:55.505 --> 17:56.907
We don't want
to have to come back.

17:56.941 --> 17:58.675
And lock
anybody up again.

17:58.709 --> 18:00.011
I understand.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.517
All right.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.719
You have
a good day then.

18:07.751 --> 18:09.154
Let's go, fellas.

18:19.096 --> 18:21.833
We should tell them
what is coming.

18:21.866 --> 18:23.535
It's not our place.

18:27.771 --> 18:29.174
Tonight, they'll come.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.796
Jeff, you're home.

19:33.236 --> 19:34.705
Feeling a bit mushy,
are we?

19:34.739 --> 19:36.607
Very mushy.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.883
Listen,
we're on our way,

19:44.915 --> 19:46.818
we'll be be there
in five minutes.

19:46.850 --> 19:49.654
Okay, stay inside
until then.

19:49.686 --> 19:52.256
I understand that.
Stay inside.

20:12.076 --> 20:14.078
All righty,

20:14.110 --> 20:15.946
looks like I'm done here.

20:17.581 --> 20:19.751
Hey, what do you say, babe?

20:19.783 --> 20:22.319
Wanna go get some grub?

20:22.353 --> 20:24.556
Here you go.

20:24.588 --> 20:26.089
Steak.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.296
Can't afford steak.

21:23.313 --> 21:25.749
She said she saw
Clyde Campbell.

21:27.751 --> 21:30.989
That old lady's
losing her marbles.

21:31.021 --> 21:32.924
Clyde Campbell?

21:32.956 --> 21:34.626
He died almost a week ago.

21:34.658 --> 21:35.859
What?

21:35.893 --> 21:39.163
For Christ sake,
I was at his funeral.

21:39.195 --> 21:41.366
She swears it was him.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.166
Up and about,

21:43.200 --> 21:45.903
trying to get
into the house.

21:45.935 --> 21:49.040
So you think we should
take her up to the clinic?

21:49.072 --> 21:50.707
Lieutenant Harper,

21:50.741 --> 21:52.810
please stop pointing
your firearm at me.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.113
Sorry.

21:55.146 --> 21:56.681
You always do that.

21:58.148 --> 21:59.716
But to answer your question,

21:59.750 --> 22:01.219
yes.

22:01.251 --> 22:04.222
If the old broad is
seeing dead people,

22:04.254 --> 22:05.956
we gotta
get her someplace

22:05.990 --> 22:07.925
where there's
a little bit more padding.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.797
This is boss man Mike
on the mic.

22:12.829 --> 22:14.866
I've been getting some
distressing phone calls

22:14.898 --> 22:16.667
this hallow's Eve.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.736
Now I don't know
if you cats

22:18.769 --> 22:20.805
are playing tricks
on the old boss,

22:20.838 --> 22:23.441
but...

22:23.473 --> 22:25.842
hello, you're on the mic
with Mike who's call...

22:25.876 --> 22:27.177
they're in my house!

22:30.380 --> 22:32.149
Tell you what,
ghouls and goblins,

22:32.183 --> 22:33.317
sounds like y'all
are really having

22:33.349 --> 22:34.985
a blast out there
this Halloween.

22:35.019 --> 22:36.688
Some of these pranks
are really starting to scare

22:36.721 --> 22:38.690
the ol' boss man,
though.

22:38.723 --> 22:40.290
Tell you what, let's calm
things down a little bit.

22:40.323 --> 22:41.458
Let's get
into another ditty.

22:41.492 --> 22:43.027
And also don't forget,

22:43.059 --> 22:45.262
for the finest one-eye
burger on the river,

22:45.296 --> 22:48.232
come on down
to the Nilbog food-hut.

22:48.264 --> 22:50.801
And don't forget to ask
for Sally's special sauce.

22:50.835 --> 22:52.437
Enjoy the song.

23:14.791 --> 23:16.160
That's nice.

23:20.164 --> 23:21.965
Hey, what's wrong?

23:26.302 --> 23:28.739
You hungry?

23:30.073 --> 23:31.508
No.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.043
A little sleepy.

23:36.046 --> 23:39.450
Well, I'm gonna make
myself some eggs.

23:39.482 --> 23:42.287
If you wake up, come to
the kitchen and join me.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.430
We gotta cross
a graveyard?

23:53.463 --> 23:55.198
No.

23:55.232 --> 23:58.202
You stay with the car,
I'll take care of it.

23:58.234 --> 24:00.405
I'll be right back.

24:01.905 --> 24:03.407
Damn, he's...

24:07.278 --> 24:08.813
whoa.

24:08.846 --> 24:10.515
What the fuck?

24:10.548 --> 24:13.818
Lucy, what the fuck
are you doing?

24:45.616 --> 24:49.086
Lucy, you jump out in front of
my car. Nearly killing you and me.

24:49.118 --> 24:50.288
Now you've got me
in Robertson's laboratory

24:50.320 --> 24:52.088
without telling me why.

24:52.121 --> 24:53.256
In fact, I'm done.

24:53.290 --> 24:54.959
This is
quiet time.

24:54.992 --> 24:56.327
You have five seconds to tell me

24:56.359 --> 24:57.828
why I'm not arresting
you right now.

24:57.861 --> 24:59.563
I believe we have
a very huge problem.

24:59.597 --> 25:01.365
One of lab's field
sensors has just detected

25:01.397 --> 25:03.033
some kind
of kinetic energy pulse

25:03.067 --> 25:05.469
that may very well kill
any living thing it touches.

25:05.501 --> 25:06.870
Right... what?

25:06.904 --> 25:08.271
Kelton, focus.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.141
Based on my readings
and calculations,

25:10.174 --> 25:11.309
we have about ten minutes

25:11.341 --> 25:12.475
until another pulse hits

25:12.509 --> 25:14.145
and covers the entire down.

25:14.177 --> 25:15.847
-Nifty.
-That's bad.

25:15.879 --> 25:17.247
-Not nifty.
-Remember the whole,

25:17.280 --> 25:18.448
"could kill any living thing
it touches"

25:18.482 --> 25:20.483
part of our conversation.

25:20.517 --> 25:22.220
Shit!

25:22.252 --> 25:26.089
-You scared me.
-I did, didn't I?

25:26.123 --> 25:28.326
I couldn't sleep.

25:28.358 --> 25:30.394
I'm gonna run down to Sammy's
and grab some goodies, okay?

25:30.426 --> 25:31.896
I'll be back
in 20 minutes.

25:31.928 --> 25:34.030
Hey, I love you.

25:34.063 --> 25:36.399
Did I tell you
I love you tonight?

25:36.433 --> 25:37.868
No.

25:37.902 --> 25:40.037
I will.

26:20.711 --> 26:22.313
Jeff.

26:22.346 --> 26:24.515
I want you to leave your job.

26:24.548 --> 26:27.151
I know. I know it's
a lot of money.

26:27.184 --> 26:29.119
But I don't care.

26:29.153 --> 26:31.622
You were gone
for two whole months.

26:31.655 --> 26:34.357
And I was all alone.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.927
All I have now is this pillow

26:36.961 --> 26:38.128
that smells like you.

26:38.162 --> 26:40.364
And since I feel
so distant from you,

26:40.396 --> 26:42.433
I've resorted to talking to it.

26:45.336 --> 26:46.671
Please,

26:46.703 --> 26:48.039
baby.

26:48.071 --> 26:50.340
If you love me,

26:50.374 --> 26:51.943
stay home.

26:56.613 --> 26:58.349
You think
he'll go for it?

27:01.617 --> 27:03.987
More boobs.

27:06.423 --> 27:07.558
Jeff.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.459
I want you to leave your job.

27:09.492 --> 27:12.530
I know, but Lucy
seems pretty sure.

27:12.562 --> 27:16.166
Thanks, Larry. They're gonna
have a hard time believing this.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.736
As long as they evacuate the town,
it doesn't matter what they believe.

27:18.769 --> 27:21.038
-We have to seal this place.
-But why?

27:21.070 --> 27:24.140
This facility houses a particle
physics lab with a lead lining

27:24.174 --> 27:26.242
to prevent any wayward
particles of electricity

27:26.276 --> 27:27.411
from getting out.

27:27.444 --> 27:28.646
Hopefully it will
work in reverse

27:28.678 --> 27:30.380
and prevent something
from getting in.

27:30.414 --> 27:31.549
-The pulse?
-Yes.

27:31.581 --> 27:33.249
If my figures
are correct,

27:33.282 --> 27:35.086
we have less than five
minutes until meltdown.

27:35.118 --> 27:37.021
Lucy, less big words.

27:37.053 --> 27:39.622
This pulse is unlike
anything ever charted before.

27:39.655 --> 27:40.992
It packs
a large amount

27:41.024 --> 27:42.459
of kinetic,
or moving energy.

27:42.492 --> 27:44.127
I believe that the
next time it happens,

27:44.161 --> 27:45.463
it will reach out
even further,

27:45.495 --> 27:47.397
causing any living thing
it comes in contact with

27:47.431 --> 27:49.500
to have a heart attack
or something similar.

27:49.532 --> 27:50.667
How do you
know all this?

27:50.701 --> 27:53.471
Back off, man,
I'm a scientist.

27:53.503 --> 27:54.637
And we're safe in here?

27:54.671 --> 27:56.040
I'm not sure.

27:58.642 --> 28:01.278
The night can finally begin
for you have arrived.

28:01.310 --> 28:02.612
How's your victory romp?

28:07.483 --> 28:10.553
I believe he's still
in between rounds.

28:10.587 --> 28:12.723
Right.

28:20.396 --> 28:22.232
Come on.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.600
What does it take?

28:23.634 --> 28:25.603
I need something
to help me fall asleep.

28:25.636 --> 28:27.471
And forget I ever existed.

28:27.503 --> 28:30.273
I told you, I can't sell you
alcohol this late.

28:30.307 --> 28:31.442
I'm sorry.

28:31.474 --> 28:33.778
You smug fuck Nazi.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.346
I will shoot you.

29:36.205 --> 29:37.841
Did you lock
the door?

29:37.875 --> 29:39.210
I always
lock the door.

29:45.715 --> 29:48.651
Jamie! They're
in our house.

29:48.684 --> 29:50.120
Where are you?

30:32.596 --> 30:33.731
Shit.

30:39.703 --> 30:41.204
Do you think
the lead stopped it?

30:41.238 --> 30:42.439
I'm not sure.

30:42.472 --> 30:43.840
I felt the wave.

30:43.874 --> 30:46.577
Maybe it lessened
the strength of the blast.

30:46.609 --> 30:48.212
So the whole town is...

30:48.244 --> 30:50.747
too early
to determine.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.283
Dead guy.

31:00.290 --> 31:01.658
Somehow I think
my calculations

31:01.692 --> 31:03.594
were a tad off.

31:03.626 --> 31:04.761
Dead guy.

31:09.933 --> 31:13.270
Think they're freaked out
'cause of the quake?

31:13.302 --> 31:15.572
No, I think
they've been drinking.

31:15.606 --> 31:17.974
Look at the way they walk.

31:20.243 --> 31:22.812
Mac?

31:22.846 --> 31:25.183
I think I'm gonna
go inside now.

31:26.683 --> 31:28.452
Okay, Danny boy.

31:28.484 --> 31:29.886
I'm gonna go see
if they need an ambulance.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.462
Help!

31:56.812 --> 31:59.582
Open the door!

31:59.616 --> 32:02.386
It's okay,
we're alive.

32:03.919 --> 32:06.022
-Open the fucking door.
-Come on, let's go.

32:06.056 --> 32:07.258
Come on!

32:08.625 --> 32:10.461
Jesus Christ!

32:15.065 --> 32:18.469
No, ma'am. We've got everybody
out on call right now.

32:18.501 --> 32:21.739
We're gonna get somebody over
to you as soon as possible.

32:21.771 --> 32:24.907
Hello? Hel...

32:24.941 --> 32:28.612
Nilbog PD.

32:28.645 --> 32:30.848
Yes, sir.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.916
-Yep, we'll be right there.
-Nilbog PD.

32:33.950 --> 32:37.788
Chief. Kelton's over at the
Robertson laboratory with Lucy Grimm.

32:37.820 --> 32:40.323
She thinks she's figured out
what's going on.

32:40.357 --> 32:41.825
Chief?

32:41.857 --> 32:44.828
Right. Get Henry, Trevor
and Becky on the line,

32:44.860 --> 32:47.463
have 'em gear up and meet us
at the Robertson lab.

32:47.496 --> 32:48.831
We're gonna have
to assess this situation

32:48.865 --> 32:51.568
and deal with the issues
one at a time, people.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.370
-Yes, sir.
-Get a car.

32:54.404 --> 32:56.973
Chief Simpson here.

32:58.974 --> 33:00.843
Bitch.

33:00.876 --> 33:02.879
-Hey.
-What would you have me do?

33:02.913 --> 33:04.714
Let them in here to kill us all?

33:04.748 --> 33:06.450
You saw what they did
to that guy out there.

33:06.482 --> 33:09.485
-Fuck you.
-Hey, hey, calm down, Jeff.

33:09.519 --> 33:11.289
All right.

33:18.662 --> 33:20.665
Got more of our buddies
out there dancing.

33:25.402 --> 33:27.771
I need to get to Paula.

33:27.803 --> 33:28.973
They look...

33:40.716 --> 33:43.052
this is the boss man...
wbog.

33:43.086 --> 33:44.855
With this some
words of advice.

33:44.887 --> 33:46.689
I've spoken
to the local heroes

33:46.723 --> 33:47.991
at the police department,

33:48.023 --> 33:49.726
and they have told me
to advise you

33:49.760 --> 33:52.363
to go home and lock up.

33:52.396 --> 33:53.731
Apparently
this Halloween spirit

33:53.763 --> 33:55.665
is really gotten crazy
out there

33:55.698 --> 33:57.066
and people are getting nuts.

33:57.099 --> 33:59.102
It's best to leave them alone.

33:59.136 --> 34:02.439
Lock up until this
thing blows over.

34:02.472 --> 34:05.608
Boss man Mike will be here
keeping you advised all night.

34:05.642 --> 34:06.910
On what's going on out there.

34:06.943 --> 34:08.543
But for now,

34:08.577 --> 34:12.514
we are going to cut back
to another oldie

34:12.547 --> 34:14.784
looking forward to getting
you flight to foot

34:14.818 --> 34:17.987
back to the homestead...
WBOG.

34:22.458 --> 34:23.860
Help me!

34:53.956 --> 34:55.993
Ridiculous.

34:56.025 --> 34:57.528
Doesn't make any sense.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.896
What the hell would
cause those men

34:58.928 --> 35:00.129
to go rabid like that?

35:00.162 --> 35:03.599
Open your eyes.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.669
They ain't people.

35:11.975 --> 35:13.911
Okay, Jimmy.

35:13.943 --> 35:15.578
You got the floor now.

35:20.115 --> 35:24.987
Justin and I were at the
graveyard when it happened.

35:25.021 --> 35:27.790
Their hands.

35:27.823 --> 35:29.126
That was
the first thing we saw

35:29.158 --> 35:31.727
coming up,
out the of the ground.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.730
Then we saw their eyes.

35:34.763 --> 35:38.035
And they saw us.

35:38.068 --> 35:41.071
They're not just
from the graveyard either.

35:41.104 --> 35:44.841
Tons of them came charging out of
the hospital over on Winchester.

35:44.874 --> 35:47.844
This isn't
a horror movie, boys.

35:47.877 --> 35:50.680
Trust me. I know.

35:50.714 --> 35:52.950
People don't crawl
out of their graves

35:52.982 --> 35:55.185
and reek havoc.

35:55.218 --> 35:56.553
It's overplayed anyway.

35:56.586 --> 35:58.988
No, the boys are right.

35:59.022 --> 36:00.991
That's John swails out there.

36:01.024 --> 36:02.859
We buried him three weeks ago.

36:02.892 --> 36:06.262
And I'm pretty sure
he was dead when we did it.

36:06.296 --> 36:07.631
He doesn't
look dead now.

36:07.664 --> 36:10.200
No, he doesn't.

36:10.232 --> 36:11.868
The phones are down.

36:11.901 --> 36:14.271
The only thing on the
radio is boss man Mike.

36:14.303 --> 36:17.941
He says we should lock ourselves
inside and stay away from them.

36:17.973 --> 36:20.209
Wait a minute.

36:20.243 --> 36:22.246
In the movies...

36:22.278 --> 36:25.815
When you get bit by a zombie,

36:25.848 --> 36:27.783
you become a zombie.

36:27.816 --> 36:31.088
-Enough said.
-No, no.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.022
-Let's hear another theory?
-Hey hey hey hey!

36:33.055 --> 36:36.059
Hey, stop!

36:36.091 --> 36:38.628
Come on, Jimmy.
Now we're all scared.

36:38.662 --> 36:40.830
Okay, we have no idea what
we're dealing with out there.

36:40.863 --> 36:42.131
But I'm pretty sure
we're not dealing

36:42.164 --> 36:44.834
with some zombies
from the movies, agreed?

36:44.868 --> 36:47.304
Agreed?

36:47.336 --> 36:51.274
I read a book, telling me
how to deal with these...

36:51.307 --> 36:52.708
Things.

36:52.742 --> 36:54.278
If there was
ever an outbreak.

36:54.310 --> 36:57.847
Now, I'm not sure
what number it was

36:57.881 --> 37:00.617
but I'm pretty sure it was
close to the number one rule,

37:00.649 --> 37:04.687
not to let your bitten
friends live.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.123
It was just
a book, Jimmy.

37:07.156 --> 37:08.992
Let's not go killing
each other just yet.

37:09.024 --> 37:12.095
Until we figure out
what we're dealing with, okay?

37:12.127 --> 37:13.564
Okay?

37:14.897 --> 37:17.166
Everything...

37:17.200 --> 37:19.870
Seems wrong.

37:19.903 --> 37:21.203
We need a plan.

37:21.236 --> 37:22.705
That's right,
a plan.

37:22.738 --> 37:24.675
Evacuation should be
one of the steps.

37:24.707 --> 37:27.109
So we wait for them to get
here and figure out what to do.

37:27.142 --> 37:28.278
-We need protection.
-Protection?

37:28.310 --> 37:29.680
In case some
of them get in.

37:29.713 --> 37:31.180
-How many are out there?
-Not sure.

37:31.214 --> 37:32.916
How many corpses with
intact hearts are in town?

37:32.948 --> 37:35.084
-What?
-Never mind, I'll explain later.

37:35.118 --> 37:37.888
We need all the ammo and
weaponry you have in your car.

37:37.921 --> 37:40.723
-You mean, going outside?
-That would be where the car is, yes.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.263
Help me, help me!
Somebody!

38:25.001 --> 38:26.669
Stop!

38:26.702 --> 38:27.905
Whoa!

38:30.272 --> 38:31.807
What the fuck, Paula?

38:31.841 --> 38:33.210
Move it,
let's move it.

38:33.243 --> 38:34.812
Let's move it back.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.881
Go, go!

38:41.885 --> 38:43.086
We can't stay here.

38:43.118 --> 38:44.754
And why the hell not?

38:44.787 --> 38:45.921
We have food.

38:45.955 --> 38:48.025
We have power.

38:48.057 --> 38:50.393
And how long after we go outside
that door do we become zombies fodder?

38:50.426 --> 38:51.761
Not to say
they're zombies.

38:51.794 --> 38:53.030
There's no other word

38:53.062 --> 38:54.930
I can think of for them
at the moment.

38:54.964 --> 38:56.767
He's right. Where the
hell are we gonna go?

38:56.800 --> 38:58.901
Well eventually they're
gonna find their way in.

38:58.935 --> 39:00.871
So we either try to find
somewhere safer to go,

39:00.903 --> 39:02.805
or we just wait
for them to get in.

39:02.839 --> 39:04.374
Jeff's right.

39:04.406 --> 39:07.176
Maybe we can find someplace
that they're not at.

39:07.209 --> 39:10.213
We can't see zombies,
zombies can't see us, right?

39:17.821 --> 39:20.790
It's okay.

39:20.823 --> 39:23.426
Mom is in a better
place now.

39:23.459 --> 39:27.863
She told us to run,
and that's what we did.

39:27.897 --> 39:30.834
They tore her apart,
Jimmy.

39:30.867 --> 39:33.303
Hey...

39:33.336 --> 39:35.738
Hey!

39:35.772 --> 39:37.441
You listen to me.

39:37.473 --> 39:39.475
I will not let
anything happen to you,

39:39.508 --> 39:42.411
do you understand me?

39:42.444 --> 39:44.814
You are not
going to die.

39:46.482 --> 39:47.917
You're not gonna die.

39:53.756 --> 39:57.059
Well,
what about dad?

40:00.396 --> 40:02.865
The phone lines
are down.

40:02.899 --> 40:05.068
I'm sure he's fine.

40:05.100 --> 40:08.771
Our house is nowhere near
the hospital or cemetery.

40:08.805 --> 40:10.473
Hey...

40:10.506 --> 40:12.175
He's probably gonna sleep
through this whole thing.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.915
And even if he was awake,

40:19.948 --> 40:22.351
he'd want us
to keep moving.

40:22.385 --> 40:26.089
We promised mom, right?

40:26.122 --> 40:28.024
It's time to be brave.

40:34.330 --> 40:37.200
We're with you, Jeff.

40:37.232 --> 40:39.401
We stay, we die.

40:39.435 --> 40:41.938
Here are the keys to my car over
at the gas and sip.

40:41.970 --> 40:44.774
It should fit all of us.

40:44.807 --> 40:46.075
Thank you.

40:46.109 --> 40:49.312
Just make sure
me and my em are safe.

40:49.345 --> 40:50.781
We will.

40:50.814 --> 40:53.484
Hey, it's gonna
be okay, squirt.

40:59.155 --> 41:00.524
It's for burglars.

41:00.557 --> 41:03.260
Big ones.

41:03.292 --> 41:07.097
Figured it might help.

41:07.129 --> 41:08.365
Well,
the front's no good.

41:08.397 --> 41:10.466
Let's try
around back.

41:10.499 --> 41:12.935
I'll come with you
and check it out.

41:12.968 --> 41:14.336
Jimmy, you keep
an eye on everyone

41:14.370 --> 41:16.839
while we're gone, okay?

41:16.872 --> 41:19.075
Okay.

41:22.912 --> 41:25.080
So going outside.

41:25.113 --> 41:27.184
Plan still
hasn't changed.

41:32.254 --> 41:35.357
-So far I'm liking the plan.
-Shut up, Kelton.

41:35.390 --> 41:37.026
Kink in the plan.

41:38.428 --> 41:40.363
Well, at least
they're the slow...

41:40.396 --> 41:41.798
shit.

41:45.234 --> 41:46.970
What are you doing,
get inside?

41:47.002 --> 41:49.138
Just... Close that
door and lock up.

41:49.171 --> 41:51.006
We don't want them busting
through there and getting in.

41:51.039 --> 41:52.875
We gotta keep
the place clean.

41:52.908 --> 41:54.243
And... just the lock...

41:54.276 --> 41:55.945
okay, you can't
hear me anymore.

41:55.979 --> 41:57.347
That's all right, okay.

41:57.379 --> 41:58.881
All right,
you're an action hero.

41:58.914 --> 42:00.316
You're a fucking
action hero.

42:00.350 --> 42:02.352
Come on.
Do work.

42:09.492 --> 42:10.993
I got 'em.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.499
Nice to see you alive.

42:16.531 --> 42:19.202
-Are you okay?
-We have to find Jeff. He went to Sammy's.

42:19.234 --> 42:21.370
Okay, go inside.
We'll make a plan.

42:21.403 --> 42:22.539
Chief, are you good?

42:22.571 --> 42:24.173
This about oughta do it.

42:24.207 --> 42:25.442
Inside.

42:25.475 --> 42:26.977
Sir.

42:30.046 --> 42:31.448
Awful dark in here, Sammy.

42:31.481 --> 42:33.049
Yeah, the light bulb
busted

42:33.082 --> 42:35.919
and I didn't get
a chance to fix it.

42:35.952 --> 42:37.354
Hey, I think
I found the door.

42:37.386 --> 42:39.455
-Yeah, that's it.
-Open on three?

42:39.488 --> 42:40.624
Ready. Right. One...

42:52.935 --> 42:55.372
shit, Sammy.

42:55.405 --> 42:59.341
What do we do?

42:59.374 --> 43:01.177
We gotta keep moving.

43:06.082 --> 43:08.618
First Mac,
now Sammy...

43:08.651 --> 43:10.620
I don't know how much more
of this shit I can take.

43:10.653 --> 43:11.988
Hey, I got
two questions.

43:12.021 --> 43:13.589
How did that thing
get in here?

43:13.622 --> 43:17.159
And is there a clear path
to that woman's car?

43:19.495 --> 43:21.998
Okay.

43:22.031 --> 43:23.500
I'll look out.

43:23.533 --> 43:26.236
You make sure we don't
get blitzed again.

43:26.269 --> 43:29.006
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:36.245 --> 43:37.647
Fuck.

43:42.118 --> 43:43.420
They're destroying
the whole town.

43:43.452 --> 43:44.586
Where's Henry?

43:44.620 --> 43:45.955
He didn't make it.

43:45.988 --> 43:47.323
Those fucks got 'em.

43:47.356 --> 43:49.291
All right,
understand.

43:49.325 --> 43:51.694
Did you hear me? I said,
they fucking got Henry.

43:51.727 --> 43:54.030
Becky, you're a cop.
Serve and protect.

43:54.062 --> 43:56.499
Come on.

43:56.531 --> 43:58.234
I want you to keep
an eye out

43:58.267 --> 44:00.069
and you're gonna radio me
if you see anything.

44:00.102 --> 44:03.039
If you see anything, no
judgment calls, you radio to me.

44:03.071 --> 44:04.207
-You got that?
-Yes, chief.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.508
All right.

44:10.613 --> 44:12.348
Why are you
locking the door?

44:12.381 --> 44:16.086
There's nothing good
on the other side.

44:16.118 --> 44:17.354
They got Sammy.

44:22.758 --> 44:25.127
Let's get back
to the others.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.495
Right.

44:26.528 --> 44:28.164
Everything here is bad.

45:01.196 --> 45:04.666
I'm not gonna
fucking die, tonight.

45:12.207 --> 45:15.345
So, Lucy,
what's going on?

45:17.546 --> 45:20.582
And the spotlight's
on me.

45:20.615 --> 45:23.052
Okay.

45:23.086 --> 45:25.055
Been bored
during rendering,

45:25.088 --> 45:27.057
helps keep me sane.

45:27.089 --> 45:29.691
Not important.

45:29.725 --> 45:32.595
I have worked out
eight drafts before this.

45:32.627 --> 45:35.432
And the variables seem
to rule them all out.

45:35.464 --> 45:38.734
So my ninth plan
seems flawless

45:38.767 --> 45:41.603
and is what I believe
to be true.

45:41.636 --> 45:44.441
Shortly after dusk,
a centralized hub

45:44.473 --> 45:48.144
of an unknown form of
kinetic energy formed here.

45:48.176 --> 45:50.446
After its formation,
it sent out a shockwave

45:50.479 --> 45:53.816
or pulse
of the energy.

45:53.850 --> 45:56.252
I thought that the
energy in this wave

45:56.285 --> 45:57.720
would cause
any living thing

45:57.752 --> 45:59.189
it came
in contact with

45:59.222 --> 46:01.723
to have
a heart attack.

46:01.756 --> 46:03.693
Because it's waveform
is so similar

46:03.725 --> 46:05.727
to that seen
on an EKG.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.229
Or heart monitor

46:07.263 --> 46:09.098
for those of you
not in the medical field,

46:09.131 --> 46:12.334
I was sure it would
stop someone's heart.

46:12.368 --> 46:14.104
I was wrong.

46:14.136 --> 46:16.272
Instead, only recently
dead humans

46:16.305 --> 46:18.575
seemed to be affected
by the energy.

46:18.607 --> 46:20.243
And to make
matters worse,

46:20.276 --> 46:23.178
these recently dead humans
are being controlled.

46:23.211 --> 46:25.380
And you came up with this...

46:25.414 --> 46:26.549
from data
I gathered.

46:26.582 --> 46:28.685
And stories
from your people.

46:28.718 --> 46:30.720
One. Not every dead thing
has been seen

46:30.752 --> 46:32.187
walking the streets.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.622
Only humans
who seemed to have died

46:33.656 --> 46:36.159
within the last month
have been seen.

46:36.191 --> 46:38.360
Two. The living dead
are focused

46:38.394 --> 46:41.363
only on exterminating
living, human beings.

46:41.397 --> 46:43.366
They don't harm each other
or do anything else

46:43.399 --> 46:45.167
that doesn't result
in killing someone,

46:45.200 --> 46:48.804
thus they are
being controlled.

46:48.838 --> 46:51.540
The only logical conclusion
is that the energy wave

46:51.573 --> 46:53.408
is causing this
to do that.

46:53.441 --> 46:57.579
The energy must be very well
manipulated and structured.

46:57.613 --> 46:59.549
A code within the pulse

46:59.582 --> 47:01.451
that embeds itself
in the deceased's body,

47:01.484 --> 47:04.319
giving it instructions
and an agenda.

47:04.352 --> 47:07.723
Something way beyond
anything mankind is capable of.

47:07.756 --> 47:09.492
Or at least
that I'm aware of.

47:09.524 --> 47:10.926
Mankind?

47:10.959 --> 47:14.597
Yes. Whatever did this,
it's not from here.

47:14.629 --> 47:16.832
-Japan.
-Kelton, think up.

47:16.865 --> 47:18.834
There was a meteor
sighting earlier today

47:18.868 --> 47:20.403
by Jeff Trent,

47:20.435 --> 47:22.838
but we had no reports
of it landing anywhere.

47:22.872 --> 47:24.406
X factor filled.

47:24.439 --> 47:26.275
It landed here.

47:26.309 --> 47:27.577
Now because
it's waveform

47:27.609 --> 47:29.745
is so similar to that seen
on an EKG.

47:29.778 --> 47:31.547
I am positive
that the resurrected

47:31.580 --> 47:33.550
are being controlled
through their hearts

47:33.582 --> 47:35.517
by the central hub here.

47:35.551 --> 47:38.788
Similar to how our own nervous
system controls our bodies.

47:38.821 --> 47:41.691
That's why only the
recently dead have been seen.

47:41.723 --> 47:43.193
Their hearts need
to be intact

47:43.225 --> 47:44.593
in order
for the energy to work.

47:44.627 --> 47:45.962
If you've damaged
the heart enough,

47:45.995 --> 47:47.763
you sever the link.

47:47.796 --> 47:48.932
Okay.

47:48.964 --> 47:51.367
So shoot 'em
in the heart.

47:51.399 --> 47:53.368
Indeed.
For the bigger problem,

47:53.401 --> 47:55.304
we need
a much better solution.

47:55.338 --> 47:58.307
what bigger problem?

47:58.341 --> 48:01.211
A few hours ago, there was a
second blast of kinetic energy.

48:01.243 --> 48:03.379
I was able to calculate
the time it seemed to take

48:03.412 --> 48:05.415
for the central hub
or nervous system,

48:05.448 --> 48:07.283
to charge up
for another wave.

48:07.316 --> 48:09.319
The second wave
traveled four times

48:09.352 --> 48:11.421
the distance
of the first wave.

48:11.453 --> 48:12.655
The dark side
of this tale

48:12.687 --> 48:15.657
is that this is
only the beginning.

48:15.691 --> 48:19.261
The second wave reached the river
surrounding the town of Nilbog.

48:19.294 --> 48:20.629
And there will be
a third wave.

48:20.662 --> 48:22.331
Perhaps many more.

48:22.365 --> 48:23.765
I'm guessing
that once again,

48:23.798 --> 48:25.434
the third wave
will travel

48:25.468 --> 48:27.904
four times the distance
of the second wave.

48:27.937 --> 48:30.772
Luckily it won't reach
the neighboring towns.

48:30.805 --> 48:31.941
I think
this will continue

48:31.973 --> 48:33.642
until it travels
the entire planet.

48:33.676 --> 48:36.479
-What? No way.
-Way.

48:36.511 --> 48:39.649
This alien nervous system
was sent here for a reason.

48:39.682 --> 48:41.783
Extermination of mankind.

48:41.816 --> 48:43.019
I need a bigger gun.

48:43.051 --> 48:44.820
The third wave,
now what happens

48:44.854 --> 48:47.290
to all the people
the zombies just killed?

48:47.323 --> 48:49.292
If their hearts
are still intact,

48:49.325 --> 48:50.792
they will rise
to join them.

48:50.825 --> 48:52.394
I need two
bigger guns.

48:52.428 --> 48:54.897
The important fact
is that we have 20 minutes

48:54.930 --> 48:58.868
before the next pulse hits.

48:58.901 --> 49:00.403
All right,
so here's our problem.

49:00.435 --> 49:02.905
Somehow those things
got into the back room.

49:02.937 --> 49:05.474
That's where
they got Sammy.

49:05.508 --> 49:07.542
It won't be long
until they get in the front.

49:07.575 --> 49:08.810
So what you're saying is

49:08.843 --> 49:10.412
we're all going to die.

49:10.446 --> 49:14.450
Quiet. Someone
important is talking.

49:14.482 --> 49:16.852
Look, I don't know.

49:16.885 --> 49:19.554
Best thing
I can think to do is...

49:19.588 --> 49:22.392
To arm ourselves and
fight our way through them

49:22.425 --> 49:23.959
when they come in.

49:23.993 --> 49:25.028
But what about
my daughter?

49:28.997 --> 49:30.934
I don't know. Just keep
her hidden. I'm sorry.

49:33.736 --> 49:35.638
All right, let's arm
ourselves the best way we can,

49:35.671 --> 49:37.006
okay?

49:43.379 --> 49:46.783
Hey, you'll be okay.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.989
I just need to know
if Paula's okay.

49:56.392 --> 49:59.828
She was all alone
when I left her.

49:59.861 --> 50:03.566
I'm sure she's gonna
be all right, man.

50:03.598 --> 50:05.702
Danny, we live
next to a graveyard.

50:10.372 --> 50:12.374
It's gonna be okay.

51:14.502 --> 51:17.740
Well, what a shitty day this
turned out to be.

51:18.941 --> 51:20.709
I have to ask,

51:20.743 --> 51:22.412
I still don't see
how you know all this, Lucy.

51:22.444 --> 51:23.979
It just so happens
that I'm a genius.

51:24.013 --> 51:25.581
Particle physics and
electromagnetic spectroscopy

51:25.613 --> 51:29.418
are my primary points
of interest.

51:29.452 --> 51:30.685
What are
the chances of that.

51:30.718 --> 51:32.754
About 23.5 million
to one.

51:32.787 --> 51:35.824
So we destroy
the central hub

51:35.857 --> 51:38.193
and stop the wave
from spreading

51:38.227 --> 51:40.430
past the town's borders.

51:40.463 --> 51:42.098
Yes, that should do it.

51:42.131 --> 51:44.500
Now how to destroy it
is behind me.

51:44.533 --> 51:46.602
I would guess it would be
prepared for such an attack,

51:46.635 --> 51:48.136
given that everything
it appears to be doing

51:48.169 --> 51:50.673
is so perfectly planned
and organized.

51:50.705 --> 51:52.107
You mentioned
that this energy wave

51:52.140 --> 51:54.010
could have killed everyone
with a heart attack.

51:54.042 --> 51:55.211
Why not just do that

51:55.243 --> 51:57.814
instead of this
resurrecting thing?

51:57.847 --> 52:00.149
My guess is that it only
wants some species dead.

52:00.182 --> 52:01.850
Not all.

52:01.883 --> 52:04.019
It would need a food source
if it were to conquer.

52:04.053 --> 52:06.122
From the looks of it,

52:06.155 --> 52:08.990
it's down near the abandoned
elementary school.

52:09.024 --> 52:10.493
Damn.

52:13.963 --> 52:15.231
Here, baby...

52:16.664 --> 52:18.200
Take some of these.

52:20.568 --> 52:25.073
Got your favorite
juice for you.

52:25.106 --> 52:26.608
No, no.
Don't chew.

52:26.642 --> 52:27.977
Just swallow.

52:28.010 --> 52:29.812
That's a good girl.

52:29.845 --> 52:32.915
Just like when you had that cold
at grandma's house.

52:32.948 --> 52:35.685
Here.

52:35.718 --> 52:37.486
One more.

52:42.725 --> 52:44.093
What a big girl.

52:47.095 --> 52:49.898
That's my baby.

52:49.932 --> 52:52.901
The next pulse will hit
within the next five minutes.

52:52.935 --> 52:55.805
Well, then, let's get
ready to go in three.

52:55.838 --> 52:57.506
Do you know
how to use this?

52:57.539 --> 52:59.508
Pull the trigger and send
out a fraction of lead.

52:59.542 --> 53:01.244
Causing pain
and if you're lucky, death.

53:01.276 --> 53:04.112
And I don't want one.

53:04.146 --> 53:08.149
You're a strange girl, Lucy.

53:08.182 --> 53:12.120
My grandmother was buried today.

53:12.153 --> 53:14.856
My god,
you're right.

53:14.890 --> 53:17.026
I'm sorry, I'm...

53:17.059 --> 53:19.160
Are you okay?

53:19.193 --> 53:20.962
In all commotion,

53:20.995 --> 53:23.865
I never called my grandfather
to see if he was okay.

53:23.899 --> 53:25.667
He would have been
within the first blast.

53:25.700 --> 53:29.004
But I just kept working.

53:29.037 --> 53:30.772
I knew his chances of survival
were...

53:30.805 --> 53:34.010
let's move out.

53:34.042 --> 53:35.845
Well, what's done is done.

53:35.877 --> 53:37.812
I just have a problem
with hiding from my feelings.

53:37.845 --> 53:40.215
But he might still
be out there alive.

53:40.249 --> 53:41.850
Not likely.

53:41.883 --> 53:44.686
He's probably
just still out there.

53:49.758 --> 53:52.060
-Hey, Kelton.
-Yeah, Larry?

53:52.093 --> 53:53.896
We're gonna go
blow up something alien

53:53.928 --> 53:55.731
to stop the dead
from rising

53:55.763 --> 53:57.300
from the graves.

53:57.332 --> 53:58.901
Yep.

53:58.934 --> 54:00.803
Just had to say it
out loud.

54:04.740 --> 54:06.209
Jeff, hurry.

54:10.613 --> 54:12.013
What did you do?

54:12.046 --> 54:13.949
What did you do?
What did you do?!

54:13.982 --> 54:15.685
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

54:15.718 --> 54:17.053
Come on, kid.
Come on, kid.

54:17.086 --> 54:18.988
Come on.

54:19.021 --> 54:20.656
Come on. Hey.

54:20.689 --> 54:22.058
Hey.

54:27.328 --> 54:29.566
Everything's gonna be okay now.

54:32.635 --> 54:34.803
Poor kid.

54:38.406 --> 54:40.042
Here they come.

54:40.075 --> 54:41.678
Move.

54:55.356 --> 54:56.825
The hell...

54:58.227 --> 55:00.196
This is gonna
complicate things.

55:11.740 --> 55:13.609
I saved her.

55:15.010 --> 55:17.981
You killed your daughter.

55:20.249 --> 55:23.051
You didn't save her.

55:23.084 --> 55:24.220
You killed her.

57:26.575 --> 57:29.178
No good.

57:30.912 --> 57:34.950
No, Becky. Bulletproof glass.
Ricochets hit us.

57:37.051 --> 57:39.021
That's new.

57:39.053 --> 57:43.158
The ones who were alive before
the first wave just got smarter.

57:43.191 --> 57:44.959
On the other side
of the laboratory,

57:44.993 --> 57:47.062
there's a sewer.

57:47.095 --> 57:49.098
You should be able to use
it to get to the school.

57:49.131 --> 57:51.033
Larry, what the fuck
are you thinking?

57:51.066 --> 57:53.301
We make a hold.

57:53.334 --> 57:56.338
Give the rest of you guys
time to get to the sewer.

57:57.606 --> 57:59.575
That's suicide.

57:59.607 --> 58:01.042
We stay here,
we all die.

58:01.075 --> 58:02.778
He would be right on that.

58:05.580 --> 58:07.015
You ready?

58:14.388 --> 58:16.357
No.

58:59.301 --> 59:01.003
Sir, the general has landed.

59:17.919 --> 59:19.320
Colonel.

59:19.354 --> 59:21.122
This is your team.

59:21.156 --> 59:23.225
Roy... horner...

59:23.258 --> 59:26.160
Stark... Lester...

59:26.193 --> 59:28.396
And of course, cap.

59:28.430 --> 59:30.198
He's the only one here
who's seen this before

59:30.231 --> 59:32.533
so he'll be number two.

59:32.566 --> 59:35.271
You have your orders.

59:35.303 --> 59:37.539
The town has been quarantined.

59:37.571 --> 59:40.642
So you can move quickly
without detection.

59:40.676 --> 59:44.013
We will hold the front line.

59:44.046 --> 59:46.616
You have three hours.
Go.

59:57.191 --> 59:59.193
Well, Sammy's awake.

59:59.227 --> 01:00:00.995
Jeff.

01:00:01.028 --> 01:00:02.664
What do we do now?

01:00:02.698 --> 01:00:05.667
I have to agree with our
blood-speckled young friend over there.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.403
I've seen enough.

01:00:07.435 --> 01:00:10.705
Crazy naked lady was enough
to kill any doubt I had.

01:00:10.738 --> 01:00:12.574
What do we do now?

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:20.381
Take as many down with us
as we can.

01:00:20.414 --> 01:00:23.418
I guess if that's
the way it has to be.

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:31.293
New problem.

01:00:41.135 --> 01:00:42.338
If Sammy's awake...

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.539
She was...

01:00:58.553 --> 01:01:00.289
Jeff...

01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:03.291
I know.

01:01:07.495 --> 01:01:09.631
I think they're
might be another option.

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:16.538
Sammy made some friends.

01:01:16.571 --> 01:01:17.740
What's your idea?

01:01:17.772 --> 01:01:19.307
That lady said her car

01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:21.210
was on the other side
of the gas and sip.

01:01:21.243 --> 01:01:22.711
-Right?
-Yeah.

01:01:22.743 --> 01:01:24.345
-I think I can get us over there.
-How?

01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:25.781
Those things
are everywhere outside.

01:01:25.814 --> 01:01:27.415
The cooler.

01:01:27.448 --> 01:01:29.050
The cooler?

01:01:29.084 --> 01:01:30.786
Sammy had a door
to the outside put in there

01:01:30.818 --> 01:01:32.353
for deliveries.

01:01:32.386 --> 01:01:36.124
Those things
might not know it's there.

01:01:36.158 --> 01:01:38.493
It's worth a shot.

01:01:38.526 --> 01:01:41.262
What do you think guys,
you up for it?

01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:45.567
It's better than we all get
fucked inside plan, yeah.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.303
What about you?

01:01:56.611 --> 01:02:00.249
I didn't...

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.156
what the hell's
going on out there?

01:02:08.189 --> 01:02:13.327
That's the beginning
of something that's much worse.

01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:16.464
It is our time to say goodbye.

01:02:16.497 --> 01:02:17.665
No no no.

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:19.534
No crazy talk out of you two.

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.403
You do not know
what's going to happen.

01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:23.138
And you do not know the future.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:24.573
There's some things out here

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:26.774
and they're killing people.

01:02:26.807 --> 01:02:29.577
And we don't have time to debate
whether you have a superpower.

01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:31.814
We told you
they would come.

01:02:31.847 --> 01:02:34.415
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.

01:02:34.448 --> 01:02:36.217
I can make it.

01:02:38.687 --> 01:02:41.723
This ain't the first time
they been here.

01:02:41.756 --> 01:02:44.626
-You okay, man?
-Yeah, my face is numb, I can't see anything.

01:02:44.658 --> 01:02:45.794
Shit.

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:48.162
I feel...

01:02:48.196 --> 01:02:50.265
I was not
properly informed

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:52.834
on what the fuck
is happening here.

01:02:52.868 --> 01:02:54.403
Who knew
they could do that?

01:02:54.435 --> 01:02:56.638
That wasn't
one of them.

01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:59.640
That was something else.

01:02:59.673 --> 01:03:01.742
Else?

01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:03.779
Something else?

01:03:03.812 --> 01:03:05.247
Fuck.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.615
Are you okay?

01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:10.286
Did you seriously
just ask me that?

01:03:19.894 --> 01:03:22.363
What the fuck?

01:03:37.946 --> 01:03:41.383
Identify yourself.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.203
It doesn't bleed
like us or the zombies.

01:04:02.236 --> 01:04:06.207
Is that orange?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.377
Well, if it bleeds...

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:14.550
How far to the mark?

01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.318
Four klicks north.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.486
Any signs?

01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:19.354
No, sir.

01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:21.689
Fun time.

01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:24.292
Here they come.

01:04:24.325 --> 01:04:25.894
You know,
I find it amazing

01:04:25.926 --> 01:04:27.762
these goddamn things
don't give you the creeps.

01:04:27.796 --> 01:04:29.631
It's the other ones
you gotta worry about.

01:04:29.664 --> 01:04:31.700
That's enough chatter.
Lock and load.

01:04:31.732 --> 01:04:33.368
Let's spread hate
and vacate.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:39.374
Clear.

01:04:39.406 --> 01:04:42.243
Poor bastards never
stood a chance.

01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:46.214
Cap, we've all taken down
the dead before in one e. T.

01:04:46.247 --> 01:04:48.216
But you've been inside.

01:04:48.249 --> 01:04:50.751
How did you guys destroy
the fucking thing?

01:04:50.785 --> 01:04:53.388
Well, for starters,

01:04:53.421 --> 01:04:55.756
we weren't talking.
Roy, snap to.

01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:58.392
-Anything on the mark?
-No, sir. Just drones.

01:04:58.426 --> 01:05:00.295
Calling in this many drones

01:05:00.327 --> 01:05:01.429
-has to get someone's attention.
-Agreed.

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:02.932
Move out.

01:05:05.399 --> 01:05:06.667
You sure
you're okay?

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.969
Yeah.
I can see well enough.

01:05:08.002 --> 01:05:09.470
We gotta keep moving.

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:17.213
Nothing could
possibly go wrong.

01:05:24.718 --> 01:05:26.921
All right.
Everybody, take a breather.

01:05:26.955 --> 01:05:28.423
So go ahead and take point.

01:05:28.455 --> 01:05:30.392
Becky,
you take the back.

01:05:30.425 --> 01:05:32.394
Stopping doesn't
seem wise, Kelton.

01:05:32.426 --> 01:05:34.262
Death would be
the only outcome.

01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:36.298
Hang on, to your pants,
I've got an idea.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:38.399
I'm gonna try to reach
the military or...

01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:42.470
Fuck, anyone.

01:05:42.504 --> 01:05:45.707
This is officer Kelton
of the Nilbog PD.

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.776
If anyone's out there,
please answer.

01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:51.013
I repeat, this is officer
Kelton of the Nilbog PD.

01:05:51.046 --> 01:05:52.681
If anybody's out there.

01:05:52.714 --> 01:05:54.516
Please, answer.

01:05:54.548 --> 01:05:57.852
I repeat, this is officer
Kelton of the Nilbog PD.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:05:59.588
If anyone...

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.624
hey...

01:06:02.656 --> 01:06:04.859
This is officer Kelton
of the Nilbog PD.

01:06:04.892 --> 01:06:06.394
Hello?

01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:07.896
-If anybody's out there...
-Hello?

01:06:07.928 --> 01:06:09.798
Right, Sammy used
to listen to the police talk.

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.466
He said it was
his gossip channel.

01:06:11.499 --> 01:06:12.634
Too bad the stupid bastard

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:14.670
somehow forgot
it was here.

01:06:14.702 --> 01:06:16.704
Hey, Kelton.
This is Danny.

01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:18.674
You believe
we saw a meteor now?

01:06:18.707 --> 01:06:20.008
Is that Danny?

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.544
-Ask him if he's seen Jeff.
-Paula?

01:06:23.577 --> 01:06:24.979
Jeff.

01:06:25.013 --> 01:06:27.848
-You okay, baby?
-Yes. Yes, I'm okay.

01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:29.084
Kelton and some police officers

01:06:29.117 --> 01:06:31.620
are taking care of me.

01:06:31.653 --> 01:06:33.088
We're stuck here at Sammy's.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.624
We're in a sewer.

01:06:35.656 --> 01:06:37.492
I don't know who
got the better deal.

01:06:37.524 --> 01:06:41.629
Listen. We're headed
to the source of the wave.

01:06:41.662 --> 01:06:43.497
To destroy it.

01:06:43.531 --> 01:06:44.900
Okay.

01:06:44.932 --> 01:06:46.867
The old school
on pine ave.

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:48.403
You know it?

01:06:48.435 --> 01:06:50.705
Yeah.

01:06:50.738 --> 01:06:52.073
Listen, baby, I don't know
if I'm gonna get a chance

01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:54.475
to tell
you this again.

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.948
Paula Trent,
I love you.

01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:03.118
I love you.

01:07:03.151 --> 01:07:06.988
-Kelton, can you hear me?
-I'm here.

01:07:07.021 --> 01:07:09.423
Listen, I know you and
I never really got along,

01:07:09.457 --> 01:07:12.661
but I'm gonna ask you
something right now.

01:07:12.693 --> 01:07:13.894
Go ahead.

01:07:13.928 --> 01:07:15.763
I need you
to look after my girl,

01:07:15.796 --> 01:07:18.966
I'm begging you, you keep
my Paula alive, okay?

01:07:18.999 --> 01:07:21.035
I will.

01:07:21.068 --> 01:07:23.437
And, Jeff.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.905
Yeah?

01:07:24.939 --> 01:07:26.975
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:07:31.613 --> 01:07:33.714
Jeff?

01:07:33.747 --> 01:07:35.117
Yeah, baby?

01:07:35.149 --> 01:07:36.917
I'm so scared.

01:07:38.685 --> 01:07:41.055
Jeff, that battery's
about to die.

01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:43.825
Listen, baby, I don't have a
lot of time right now, okay?

01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:45.861
No, no.
Please, don't go.

01:07:45.894 --> 01:07:47.529
Listen, I'm sorry, baby.
It's the battery.

01:07:47.562 --> 01:07:49.064
I think it's gonna die
any second.

01:07:59.506 --> 01:08:03.010
So much for the radio. You know
we're in a store. We have batteries.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.982
She's alive.

01:08:08.015 --> 01:08:10.851
Yeah, she is. But we
gotta get moving, man.

01:08:10.885 --> 01:08:13.655
What happens if they
take over the whole world?

01:08:13.687 --> 01:08:15.523
We take it back.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:25.499
I was thinking.

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:27.702
-These aliens...
-Aliens?

01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:31.038
What else do you know
that bleeds orange?

01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:34.908
You think they will be
protecting this central hub?

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:36.211
Most likely.

01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:38.479
You better learn
how to use their gun then.

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:04.939
Another Halloween gag?

01:09:06.506 --> 01:09:08.776
Shane?

01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:21.182
-Justin!
-Hey, hey.

01:10:21.214 --> 01:10:22.583
Justin!

01:10:22.617 --> 01:10:25.887
It's okay. This'll stop them.

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.055
-There's nothing you can do.
-No!

01:10:27.087 --> 01:10:28.122
There's nothing you can do.

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:33.261
Justin.

01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:35.729
Stop!

01:10:44.872 --> 01:10:48.743
Working is not
what the car is doing.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:52.680
We've gotta slow 'em down.

01:12:11.324 --> 01:12:13.761
Hey, hey. The cavalry.

01:12:13.794 --> 01:12:14.995
Wait.

01:12:15.029 --> 01:12:19.934
Hey. It's okay.
We're alive!

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.970
All right, talk to me,
what are we doing?

01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:23.238
Stick to the plan.

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:25.806
Right.

01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:27.441
-My god!
-Run run run.

01:12:27.475 --> 01:12:31.913
-Son of a bitch!
-Becky, we are leaving.

01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:33.414
No one leaves
this sector alive.

01:12:33.448 --> 01:12:35.350
I didn't sign on to kill
innocent people.

01:12:35.382 --> 01:12:37.217
You'll do what you're ordered
to do, soldier.

01:12:37.251 --> 01:12:38.753
Move out.

01:12:42.022 --> 01:12:43.857
Boss man, here.

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:46.828
Not sure how many of you are
still listening to me out there.

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.797
But I just want you all to
hang in there. And stay safe.

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:51.266
I've been told
by the authorities,

01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:53.801
do not head over
to Eddie's diner any more.

01:12:53.834 --> 01:12:55.270
Do not head over
to Eddie's diner.

01:12:55.302 --> 01:12:57.037
They're not letting
anyone else in.

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:59.140
They've had some
big problems over there.

01:12:59.172 --> 01:13:02.209
Go to your homes,
lock up and stay safe.

01:13:02.243 --> 01:13:03.912
And...

01:13:11.151 --> 01:13:13.253
boss man Mike...

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:19.194
now look, Jamie please.

01:13:19.226 --> 01:13:21.762
Now look, I know we have not
been the best of families.

01:13:21.796 --> 01:13:23.298
But I can fix it.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:25.199
And I can fix us.

01:13:25.232 --> 01:13:29.971
Come on,
I'm not ready yet.

01:13:30.003 --> 01:13:32.906
Everything is gonna
be all right.

01:13:48.789 --> 01:13:50.357
Holy shit.

01:13:59.467 --> 01:14:00.802
Engage.

01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:13.815
-Kelton...
-Yeah.

01:14:13.847 --> 01:14:15.315
You have a laser gun.

01:14:15.348 --> 01:14:16.517
I have a laser gun.

01:14:17.885 --> 01:14:19.921
I have a laser gun.

01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:27.328
Stark, Roy.
Take the drones.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.497
Horner,
cover fire.

01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:11.873
Nope.

01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:39.367
It's all right,
you're all safe.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.302
Colonel, he just
saved our ass.

01:15:41.334 --> 01:15:44.905
Stark, you disobey me again
and I'll kill you myself.

01:15:44.939 --> 01:15:49.577
Now, raise your weapon
and assume cover position.

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:53.080
I didn't sign up for this, sir.

01:15:53.114 --> 01:15:55.350
Get down!

01:16:04.124 --> 01:16:07.261
Edith?
What's going on here?

01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:09.631
These are the only people
left in town that I could find.

01:16:09.663 --> 01:16:11.932
We're heading across the
bridge to the military.

01:16:11.966 --> 01:16:13.401
They have this whole town
sealed off

01:16:13.434 --> 01:16:16.503
and they've got posts up
and down this river.

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:19.908
-They're shooting anyone that tries to cross it.
-What?

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.943
I guess they don't want
to take chances that...

01:16:21.976 --> 01:16:23.478
that we're one of them.

01:16:23.511 --> 01:16:25.513
Or there could be another
answer to your riddle.

01:16:25.546 --> 01:16:27.515
What I'm saying is,

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:30.417
what if they knew you were alive
and were attempting to contain

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.086
what they believe
is a contamination area.

01:16:32.119 --> 01:16:33.688
We don't have time
for conspiracy theories.

01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:35.455
People are dying.

01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:37.992
Are you sure it's okay
to just cross this bridge?

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:40.228
-Hey, guys, this one works.
-Perfect.

01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:43.231
But we're not taking any more
survivors, it's too dangerous.

01:16:43.263 --> 01:16:44.699
It's time to cross.

01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:46.967
Wait a second, are you
leading these people?

01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:48.636
They needed somebody.

01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:50.671
I understand, but maybe
you should think about this.

01:16:50.704 --> 01:16:52.940
I have.

01:16:52.973 --> 01:16:54.141
We cross now.

01:16:54.175 --> 01:16:56.945
This is a mistake, missy.

01:16:56.977 --> 01:16:58.512
But maybe they know
what they're doing.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.596
God, I don't like this.

01:17:26.373 --> 01:17:28.108
I said, fire.

01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:30.577
It's okay. I don't think
they're gonna shoot us?

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:31.745
Fire.

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.284
No!

01:17:40.354 --> 01:17:42.089
Get back.

01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:51.531
Go! Go!

01:18:01.107 --> 01:18:02.977
What the hell's
going on back there?

01:18:07.815 --> 01:18:09.283
We've...

01:18:09.315 --> 01:18:11.251
We've been here a long time.

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:15.322
-Stark. Stand down.
-I can't do that, sir.

01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:18.458
We are on a mission, soldier.
You're just wasting time.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:23.096
I will not kill
innocent people, sir.

01:18:23.129 --> 01:18:24.265
Enough of this.

01:18:27.234 --> 01:18:31.806
Where do you stand, horner?

01:18:31.838 --> 01:18:34.341
Somebody has to be alive
to carry out the mission.

01:18:41.681 --> 01:18:45.352
The next shockwave will hit
within the hour.

01:18:45.386 --> 01:18:48.356
Jeff.

01:18:48.388 --> 01:18:49.556
My god.

01:19:04.337 --> 01:19:06.373
We need to see
this through.

01:19:06.406 --> 01:19:08.409
Jeff, no.

01:19:08.441 --> 01:19:10.444
-What are you doing?
-We can help.

01:19:10.477 --> 01:19:11.846
-Nope.
-What?

01:19:11.878 --> 01:19:14.281
Jeff, I'm not
a smart man.

01:19:14.315 --> 01:19:16.250
Okay, I know
just enough to get by.

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:17.852
That's about it.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:21.388
You have been working
the entire night

01:19:21.422 --> 01:19:22.857
trying to get
to this girl,

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:24.525
you finally have her,

01:19:24.557 --> 01:19:26.293
and now you wanna
take her back

01:19:26.327 --> 01:19:28.128
into immediate danger,

01:19:28.162 --> 01:19:30.631
just to see if you guys'll
make it out okay?

01:19:30.663 --> 01:19:32.532
-We can help.
-No.

01:19:32.565 --> 01:19:33.733
You can't.

01:19:33.766 --> 01:19:36.736
Your part
in this story is over.

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:38.272
You got the girl,

01:19:38.305 --> 01:19:41.409
in the middle
of a world ending event.

01:19:41.441 --> 01:19:44.278
Both of you should
be dead. Very dead.

01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:46.647
But you're not, it couldn't
be any clearer than that.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.850
-No, I...
-you did your job.

01:19:48.882 --> 01:19:50.851
You're the hero.

01:19:50.885 --> 01:19:53.620
Now take your wife,
and find a safe place.

01:19:56.789 --> 01:20:00.694
You're a good man, Jeff.

01:20:00.727 --> 01:20:02.463
Don't get stupid on me.

01:20:07.234 --> 01:20:08.403
Thanks.

01:20:15.376 --> 01:20:17.712
So you're not gonna kill us?

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:19.779
It's not my mission.

01:20:19.812 --> 01:20:22.783
But until we get
the threat neutralized.

01:20:22.815 --> 01:20:25.218
I would recommend not
sticking your head out of town.

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:27.221
No.
We've seen first hand

01:20:27.253 --> 01:20:29.789
what our government's policy
towards that kind of threat is.

01:20:29.823 --> 01:20:32.560
Okay, listen up.

01:20:32.592 --> 01:20:34.729
Since we're down
a man or two,

01:20:34.762 --> 01:20:37.165
I need all your help
killing all the bad guys.

01:20:37.198 --> 01:20:39.267
So if you've got the guts,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.436
pick up a weapon and follow.

01:20:45.806 --> 01:20:47.508
You wanna come kill some aliens?

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.709
Yup.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:20:58.786
Come on. Let's go finish
the third act.

01:21:08.861 --> 01:21:10.198
What's in there?

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.765
We don't know exactly.

01:21:11.798 --> 01:21:13.667
Captain's the only one
that's been in there.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.570
He took off his clothes
and went after a hostel.

01:21:16.604 --> 01:21:19.472
I've seen
this recently.

01:21:19.506 --> 01:21:21.709
That is a trademark
of the insane.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.570
Captain came through
here all right.

01:22:07.553 --> 01:22:08.789
Professor.

01:22:10.958 --> 01:22:12.693
Lucy.

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:14.662
-Get out of here.
-We're gonna get you out.

01:22:14.695 --> 01:22:18.833
-They're after you.
-What?

01:22:18.865 --> 01:22:22.502
The project you were working on.

01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:24.337
The solaranite project.

01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:26.841
How did you know about my
photon fission research?

01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:28.008
We don't have
time for this.

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:30.343
Splitting a photon.

01:22:30.377 --> 01:22:32.946
It's not the same
as splitting an atom.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.749
Its...

01:22:34.781 --> 01:22:37.051
its power is enormous.

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:39.052
And they fear it.

01:22:39.086 --> 01:22:42.890
It's... it's too strong
of a weapon for us to have.

01:22:42.922 --> 01:22:44.891
We can't control it.

01:22:44.925 --> 01:22:46.394
My god.

01:22:46.427 --> 01:22:47.628
I didn't know.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.696
You... you have
to get out of here.

01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:51.399
This is all my fault.

01:22:59.873 --> 01:23:03.377
Everything's bad.
Everything's bad.

01:23:12.386 --> 01:23:15.990
And why aren't
they killing us?

01:23:16.022 --> 01:23:17.757
Captain.

01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:20.628
You shouldn't breathe
this stuff in.

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.462
You don't belong here.

01:23:25.798 --> 01:23:27.734
Bye, captain.

01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:30.003
The gas, it's starting
to burn.

01:23:35.376 --> 01:23:37.645
I killed the guy
who was making the gas.

01:23:37.677 --> 01:23:39.446
I know, I saw.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.482
Stark just went that way
after the naked guy.

01:23:41.515 --> 01:23:45.119
Shouldn't we go after Lucy?

01:23:45.151 --> 01:23:46.721
-Nice knowing you.
-Yeah.

01:24:13.046 --> 01:24:14.582
Shit!

01:24:32.932 --> 01:24:34.068
Are you okay?

01:24:34.101 --> 01:24:36.971
No.

01:24:50.918 --> 01:24:53.187
When I was jealous,

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.687
I had
this communicator

01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:57.758
to make my vocals
sound into something

01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:59.827
you can understand.

01:25:02.995 --> 01:25:05.598
Do not mind him.

01:25:05.632 --> 01:25:06.767
He knew nothing of you

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.037
so we silenced him.

01:25:12.205 --> 01:25:15.775
We learned of you
from the old one.

01:25:15.809 --> 01:25:17.077
You have started a war

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:20.580
between my people and yours.

01:25:20.614 --> 01:25:23.517
I will let
none survive.

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:24.952
True...

01:25:24.985 --> 01:25:26.487
We have you now,

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:30.691
but soon others
will follow your ignorance.

01:25:32.825 --> 01:25:36.096
So why not skip
to the end of your story

01:25:36.128 --> 01:25:40.767
where you all fall
under our feet.

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:44.071
Your people do not
have the mental capacity

01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:48.641
to keep up with the
technology you develop.

01:25:48.675 --> 01:25:52.480
You wield weapons
above your knowledge

01:25:52.512 --> 01:25:55.716
and play with them like toys.

01:25:57.751 --> 01:25:59.921
You are a stupid race.

01:26:11.964 --> 01:26:14.068
I'm gonna take you
back to our home world

01:26:14.101 --> 01:26:17.571
for interrogation.

01:26:17.604 --> 01:26:20.039
Everyone is dead because of me.

01:26:20.073 --> 01:26:21.542
Yeah.

01:26:21.574 --> 01:26:22.876
That they are.

01:26:26.212 --> 01:26:27.747
Sorry for the delay.

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:29.582
Harper, your face.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.222
End of the road,
captain.

01:27:12.626 --> 01:27:15.762
But, sergeant,
I'm so glad you're here.

01:27:15.796 --> 01:27:17.731
My investigation's...

01:27:17.763 --> 01:27:18.998
hey, hey, hey!

01:27:20.633 --> 01:27:23.604
I'm getting to it. Jeez.

01:27:23.637 --> 01:27:25.706
Chatty cathys.

01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:27.241
What I was trying to say

01:27:27.274 --> 01:27:29.843
is that
my research subjects,

01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:31.177
they've revealed that they're

01:27:31.211 --> 01:27:32.913
not too dissimilar from us.

01:27:32.945 --> 01:27:35.114
Two major points of comparison.

01:27:35.147 --> 01:27:37.685
One, they don't enjoy
having their spinal cords

01:27:37.717 --> 01:27:39.919
removed from their asshole.

01:27:39.953 --> 01:27:42.756
And also their forward
operating bases,

01:27:42.788 --> 01:27:45.091
well they also come with
a self-destruct mechanism.

01:27:45.124 --> 01:27:49.596
Theirs just happens to be in the
form of a lever in this vat of goo.

01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:53.132
When activated it will critically
overload their ship's power supply.

01:27:53.165 --> 01:27:54.767
What do you say,
sergeant?

01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:56.604
Roshambo you for it?

01:27:56.637 --> 01:27:59.640
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna pick gun.

01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:02.342
More for me.

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:06.681
Clarify. He's going to implode
the hive that we're standing in?

01:28:08.015 --> 01:28:09.617
It looks that way.

01:28:41.248 --> 01:28:42.915
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:28:42.949 --> 01:28:45.886
Dead.
No longer breathing.

01:28:45.918 --> 01:28:48.254
With the exception
of whatever that was,

01:28:48.288 --> 01:28:50.089
they've all
looked alike.

01:28:50.123 --> 01:28:51.892
Do you know why?

01:28:51.925 --> 01:28:53.060
Seems like
they only have

01:28:53.092 --> 01:28:55.428
two forms of skin
to hide behind.

01:28:55.462 --> 01:28:57.665
Male and female.

01:28:57.698 --> 01:29:00.234
They probably weren't planning
on blending in for very long.

01:29:00.266 --> 01:29:02.135
We can go now.

01:29:03.704 --> 01:29:06.140
How do you
know everything?

01:29:44.778 --> 01:29:46.480
They took me
from my lab.

01:29:46.512 --> 01:29:48.082
I'm so glad
you're here.

01:29:48.114 --> 01:29:49.749
Now I can see
my son again.

01:31:07.194 --> 01:31:09.363
We interrupt our programming.

01:31:09.395 --> 01:31:11.464
This is an national emergency.

01:31:11.498 --> 01:31:14.535
Important details follow.

01:31:14.568 --> 01:31:17.404
This is boss man Mike
on the mic.

01:31:17.436 --> 01:31:19.472
Apparently nobody told
these things

01:31:19.506 --> 01:31:22.309
that I was the boss man.

01:31:22.342 --> 01:31:26.580
Received word that the
military is moving away.

01:31:26.613 --> 01:31:29.583
Apparently the threat
has passed, kiddies.

01:31:29.615 --> 01:31:31.051
They're now
on to Montana

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:32.218
or someplace like that.

01:31:32.252 --> 01:31:33.854
Good luck
and good riddance

01:31:33.887 --> 01:31:35.022
to those poor saps.

01:31:35.055 --> 01:31:39.258
-Alice.
-Montana?

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:42.129
Exterminate them all.

01:31:42.162 --> 01:31:44.131
Lucy,

01:31:44.163 --> 01:31:48.868
I think we're gonna
need a new plan.

01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:51.504
I got one more ditty left in me,

01:31:51.538 --> 01:31:54.141
this is the boss man Mike
saying good night.

01:31:54.173 --> 01:31:58.110
Hopefully the bedbugs
didn't bite.

01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:28.609
Hey. Hey, man,
you okay?

01:32:28.641 --> 01:32:30.543
They're just letting people out
of town this morning.

01:32:30.577 --> 01:32:32.512
Military's done gone.

01:32:32.544 --> 01:32:34.214
They stopped shooting us.

01:32:41.421 --> 01:32:43.624
Damn near lost
my ass last night.

01:32:43.656 --> 01:32:46.260
Had those things
all over my camper.

01:32:46.293 --> 01:32:48.428
The white eyed ones too.

01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:52.598
Boss man says they're like some
sort of zombie leader or something.

01:32:52.632 --> 01:32:54.268
Killed my dog.

01:32:54.301 --> 01:32:56.136
Ate my horse.

01:32:56.168 --> 01:32:59.171
And my wife too.

01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:00.908
Made it through.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.342
God damn, it's good to be alive.

01:33:03.376 --> 01:33:05.311
Didn't think I would.

01:33:05.345 --> 01:33:08.981
Since they're using their
surroundings and wildlife.

01:33:09.015 --> 01:33:10.217
Damn.

01:33:10.249 --> 01:33:12.685
I'm gonna change my ways.

01:33:12.718 --> 01:33:16.623
I tell you me,
last night woke me up.

01:33:16.655 --> 01:33:21.193
I'm gonna be
a better person.

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:23.195
Life, man.

01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:24.498
Living.

01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:28.368
That's where it's at.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.404
You don't look so good.

01:33:31.437 --> 01:33:34.708
Where do you want me
to take you, hospital?

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:37.644
Montana, please.

01:33:37.677 --> 01:33:39.146
Montana?

01:33:40.446 --> 01:33:43.249
Why do you wanna go to...

01:33:43.283 --> 01:33:45.285
wait, wait.
Boss man said

01:33:45.318 --> 01:33:48.655
that's where the next
zombie attack's gonna be.

01:33:48.687 --> 01:33:51.691
What the hell are you hitching
your way up there for?

01:33:51.725 --> 01:33:53.660
I lost my ride.

01:33:53.693 --> 01:33:56.329
Well, you didn't
just gain a new one.

01:33:56.363 --> 01:33:59.533
I just went through the worst
night of my life, last night.

01:33:59.565 --> 01:34:01.367
There is no way in...

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.102
no way, I'm gonna trek

01:34:03.136 --> 01:34:05.571
all the way through
the gates of hell

01:34:05.605 --> 01:34:09.009
'cause you lost
your goddamn ride.

01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:10.444
Montana?

01:34:10.476 --> 01:34:12.946
That's a whole new kind
of war, man.

01:34:16.248 --> 01:34:19.552
God help us in the future.

01:36:00.552 --> 01:36:02.288
They come from bowels of hell.

01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:05.257
A transformed race
of walking dead.

01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:07.828
Zombies guided
by a master plan.

01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.198
For complete domination
of the earth.

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:15.135
Plan 9 from outer space.

01:37:01.948 --> 01:37:05.218
God help us in the future.
