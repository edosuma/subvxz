00:01.835 --> 00:02.402
This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:02.936
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.072
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.410
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.145
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.346 --> 00:15.482
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.616 --> 00:17.617
Yikes!

00:18.318 --> 00:19.586
Yaaaah...

00:22.522 --> 00:23.857
Yeaaaah!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.760
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.469
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.104 --> 00:39.506
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.009 --> 00:45.311
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.179 --> 00:47.380
the Raccoons!!

00:47.380 --> 00:49.482
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:00.660 --> 01:02.429
To succeed
in any field of art,

01:02.429 --> 01:05.298
you need skill,
talent, and luck.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.801
As a photographer,
Melissa Raccoon

01:07.801 --> 01:10.003
has her fair share of all three.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.472
But if Melissa believes
the old saying

01:12.472 --> 01:15.208
"one picture is worth
a thousand words",

01:15.208 --> 01:18.378
Cyril Sneer believes a
photograph can be worth

01:18.378 --> 01:20.013
a good deal more.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.015
Boy, this will
make a great feature

01:22.015 --> 01:24.284
for the Standard's
series on hobbies.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.320
If Melissa ever gets
here to take the pictures.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.790
Well, you know,
how busy Melissa is, Bert.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.893
It's not every day she gets
her first book published.

01:33.893 --> 01:37.530
She can take a picture
of my statue any time.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.933
I've been meaning
to talk you, Cedric.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.869
Uh, what's it supposed
to be anyway?

01:42.869 --> 01:45.772
It represents the
progress of civilization

01:45.772 --> 01:47.841
through time and space.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.210
I call it "Life".

01:51.678 --> 01:54.114
So, uh,
that's life, huh?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.682
Well,

01:55.682 --> 01:58.384
it'll look a lot more
like it when it's finished.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.587
If I ever get it finished.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.756
This darn thing is
acting up again.

02:03.756 --> 02:06.626
Hmm. I better go and
see what's keeping Melissa.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.128
Okay, Bert.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.264
Uaaah!

02:13.733 --> 02:16.636
Cedric! Oooh!

02:16.636 --> 02:18.404
Cedric! Can you hear me?!!

02:18.404 --> 02:19.973
Cedric!

02:21.107 --> 02:22.108
Cedric!

02:23.743 --> 02:25.311
Cedric!

02:26.045 --> 02:27.647
Good boy, Snag!

02:27.647 --> 02:30.250
Attaboy! Cedric?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.584
Oh no!

02:34.921 --> 02:36.523
Bert! What happened?

02:36.523 --> 02:37.657
Take care of Cedric!

02:37.657 --> 02:38.992
I'll go get help!

02:38.992 --> 02:42.061
Cedric!
Cedric! Say something!

02:44.197 --> 02:46.266
Right, Mr. Barnes.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.433
I agree!

02:47.433 --> 02:50.270
I think Snag has star quality.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.439
Of course, a hero like
Snag doesn't come cheap.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.310
Right! I'll be expecting you.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.778
And bring the contracts!

02:59.179 --> 03:02.315
Ha ha! This is
too good to be true.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.450
Pigs!! Get in here!

03:04.450 --> 03:06.319
Yes Sir, yes Sir!

03:06.786 --> 03:08.721
In an act of heroism,

03:08.721 --> 03:12.158
Snag braved the flaming inferno

03:12.158 --> 03:15.662
to rescue his young master,
Cedric Sneer.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.632
Cyril Sneer, Snag's
owner commented:

03:19.632 --> 03:21.868
I always thought he was useless,

03:21.868 --> 03:24.671
but I guess, every
dog has his day.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.539
Some story, huh Cedric?

03:26.539 --> 03:29.375
Yeah!
And thanks to Snag,

03:29.375 --> 03:31.277
I'm still here to listen to it.

03:33.646 --> 03:36.683
Funny. Snag sure
doesn't look like a hero.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.352
Well, I'd stay for
a game of checkers, pal,

03:39.352 --> 03:41.487
but I've gotta help set
up for Melissa's

03:41.487 --> 03:43.289
book publication party.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.058
Hey, you're going
to be there, right?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.527
Sure. I'm
feeling a lot better,

03:47.527 --> 03:50.964
and I wouldn't miss Melissa's
party for the world!

03:50.964 --> 03:52.298
Ciao!

03:57.237 --> 04:00.873
Pig 1: There! Nothing's
too good for Snag.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.042
Pig 2: Relax, Snag.

04:03.042 --> 04:06.579
We can't have fleas
on our hero.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.181
Arrr!

04:08.181 --> 04:10.917
Pig 3: Like a doggie treat,
Snag?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.720
Grrrr!

04:13.720 --> 04:14.988
Graaah!!
Pig 3: Yeow!!

04:14.988 --> 04:18.358
Pig 3: Oooo!

04:21.394 --> 04:23.630
Hmmm.. Not bad.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.231
What's going on?

04:25.231 --> 04:28.601
Snag! Look at that face.

04:28.601 --> 04:32.505
Uuuh, shining with love and
loyalty for his master.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.340
Let's see you do some tricks.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.677
Well. It's a start.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.445
Are you all right, Pop?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.713
Never been better.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.583
After all it's not
every day a star is born.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.952
Star? What star?

04:46.686 --> 04:48.021
This star!

04:48.021 --> 04:50.757
This charismatic canine!

04:50.757 --> 04:53.026
This magnificent mutt!

04:53.026 --> 04:55.328
This personable pooch!

04:55.328 --> 04:56.496
Snag?!

04:56.496 --> 04:58.231
None other, my boy!

04:58.231 --> 05:01.968
I've just been talking
to a big TV Producer.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.737
He read about
Snag's heroic rescue

05:04.737 --> 05:07.507
and wants him to star
in his new series,

05:07.507 --> 05:10.009
"Bob The Wonder Dog"!

05:10.009 --> 05:12.078
Bob The Wonder Dog?!

05:18.418 --> 05:20.286
It's really good of you
to throw this party for Melissa,

05:20.286 --> 05:21.421
Lady Baden-Baden.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.789
Lady Baden-Baden: Ooooh.

05:22.789 --> 05:26.826
It's the least any patron
of the arts would do.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.396
Imagine, one of our very own,

05:30.396 --> 05:32.665
publishing a book of photographs.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.769
Hohooooo, I'm sooo
proud of Melissa!

05:36.769 --> 05:38.104
We all are.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.605
Oh, Ralph!

05:39.605 --> 05:41.574
Lady Baden-Baden: Attention!

05:41.574 --> 05:42.775
Helloooo?

05:42.775 --> 05:45.311
Now that everyone is here,

05:45.311 --> 05:48.781
I'd like to propose a toast to

05:48.781 --> 05:51.117
Melissa Raccoon.

05:52.452 --> 05:56.556
May this be the
first of many books.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.462
There are
lots of telegrams

06:02.462 --> 06:03.996
of congratulations here.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.431
I'll read a few of them.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.567
"Dear Melissa, your book...

06:07.567 --> 06:09.335
Pig 2:
So what's wrong

06:09.335 --> 06:11.337
with getting an elevator?

06:13.439 --> 06:14.941
Now pay attention, Snag.

06:15.775 --> 06:16.776
Roll over.

06:17.643 --> 06:18.644
Sit up.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.979
Beg!

06:21.647 --> 06:23.216
Pig 2: Lunch is served, Sir!

06:23.216 --> 06:25.351
Ooooops!

06:25.351 --> 06:29.555
Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!

06:29.555 --> 06:31.724
Ah ha!
That's more like it!

06:34.827 --> 06:36.429
...and here's
the best one of all:

06:36.429 --> 06:38.231
to Melissa Raccoon.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.632
Congrats on book.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.234
Superb photos.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.337
Want to offer you
job as photographer

06:44.337 --> 06:46.973
for World Times magazine.

06:46.973 --> 06:51.244
Regards, John Roykirk,
managing editor.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.146
Oh wow!

06:53.146 --> 06:55.014
Oh Melissa!
This is your big chance.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.418
World Times is the hottest
news magazine going!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.886
I don't know, Ralph.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.721
This is so sudden.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.689
There's no
time to waste, Melissa.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.525
I've already called Mr. Roykirk.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.693
He'll be here tomorrow.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.267
It's the chance
of a lifetime, Melissa!

07:14.267 --> 07:16.035
Imagine! Chasing down

07:16.035 --> 07:18.604
the biggest stories
all over the world.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.206
Okay. What'll it be?

07:20.206 --> 07:22.208
Peanut butter pancakes or

07:22.208 --> 07:24.577
peanut butter waffles?

07:24.577 --> 07:25.945
Pancakes, please.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.347
Oh, and hold the peanut butter.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.883
Huh?!
Hold the peanut butter?

07:30.883 --> 07:32.785
Sheesh.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.456
Mmmmm. Some people
have no taste.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.892
Ralph, I don't
know if I'm ready for this.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.961
Trust me,
you'll love them.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.163
Of course
you are, Melissa.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.698
Look at these photos.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.900
They are as good as...
no, better

07:47.900 --> 07:50.069
than anything I've ever seen.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.471
That's not the point.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.606
I know I'm a good photographer

07:53.606 --> 07:55.641
and that's why you need me here.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
I like working at the Standard.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.213
I just started a new series.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.881
I want to see that through.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.983
I want
what's best for you.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.420
Besides, I can finish
the photo series, Melissa.

08:08.588 --> 08:09.722
Huh?

08:09.722 --> 08:12.158
This is a major step
in your career, Melissa.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.294
I can't sit by and
let you throw it away.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.329
But...

08:16.329 --> 08:19.932
Voila!!
Pancakes a la Bert.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.201
Huh?
Sorry, Bert,

08:22.201 --> 08:24.337
I've lost my appetite.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.244
Pig 1: C'mon, Snag!

08:31.244 --> 08:33.246
Pig 2:

08:33.246 --> 08:35.948
Pig 1: The boss wants
you looking perfect

08:35.948 --> 08:40.119
for Mr. Barnes, the TV producer.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.889
Pig 2: Or as close
as we can get,

08:42.889 --> 08:45.791
considering what we
have to work with.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.026
Pig 1:

08:47.026 --> 08:49.195
Which isn't much.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.231
Pig 3: Doggie treats, Snag!

08:52.231 --> 08:54.467
Doggie treats!

08:54.467 --> 08:55.535

this is perfect!

10:03.803 --> 10:05.137
Rugged good looks,

10:05.137 --> 10:07.673
a somewhat intelligent
gleam in his eye.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.075
Perfect!

10:09.075 --> 10:10.943
Of course he's perfect!

10:10.943 --> 10:12.778
I raised him myself.

10:12.778 --> 10:16.215
I think
we can use him. I do.

10:16.215 --> 10:18.250
Great!
Let's talk money.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.286
Not so
fast, Mr. Sneer.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.622
We have to see how
he'll look on screen.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.825
We have to see if
he can actually act.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.727
Act?!
Of course he can act!

10:27.727 --> 10:30.563
Why, I taught him
everything he knows!

10:30.563 --> 10:32.999
And I'm sure
you did a marvelous job,

10:32.999 --> 10:35.835
but we still need a screen test.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.204
Certainly.
That won't be a problem,

10:38.204 --> 10:39.839
will it, Snag?!

10:41.574 --> 10:45.077
Mr. Roykirk, you've
made the perfect choice.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.613
Melissa is a superb photographer.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.282
If I didn't think so,
Ralph, I wouldn't be here.

10:50.282 --> 10:54.086
Say! These rescue
shots are tremendous.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.755
Just the kind of action pictures

10:55.755 --> 10:57.456
we need at our magazine.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.759
Nice little operation
you've got here.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.294
Well, I'm sure
it doesn't compare

11:02.294 --> 11:04.330
to the World Times offices.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.665
Ah, you can
have the biggest office

11:05.665 --> 11:06.966
in the world, Ralph,

11:06.966 --> 11:09.735
but if you don't have the
right people working in it,

11:09.735 --> 11:10.803
you've got nothing.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.638
From what I've seen
of your newspaper,

11:12.638 --> 11:15.107
you've got the right people.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.476
Speaking of that,
where is Melissa?

11:17.476 --> 11:20.446
Melissa!
Mr. Roykirk is here.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.481
Oh, of course, Ralph.

11:22.481 --> 11:23.849
I'll be out in a minute!

11:23.849 --> 11:27.153
I'm just finishing off some
prints for the next edition.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.322
My last edition.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.327
Okay,
Snag, swim.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.562
Paddle, paddle.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.964
Swim Snaggy baby!

11:38.964 --> 11:41.767
Snag, be a good boy now!

11:41.767 --> 11:43.969
And get in the water!!!

11:45.705 --> 11:48.140
Perfect! Ace! Cut!

11:48.140 --> 11:50.543
This is real dog heaven.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.445
I have.. um, this is gorgeous.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.046
Snag, you're going to be a star.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.648
You are going to be nominated!

11:55.648 --> 11:57.183
Pig 3: (laughs) Here, Snag.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.051
C'mon boy.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.223
Pig 3: Uaaaah!

12:07.393 --> 12:11.030
Pig 1: This is costing the boss
a fortune in doggie treats.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.700
Action!

12:14.700 --> 12:17.002
Action Snag!

12:17.002 --> 12:19.271
Ugh! Will you come here!

12:19.271 --> 12:22.341
Snag, the
man said "action!"

12:25.578 --> 12:27.780
Brilliant, inspired,

12:27.780 --> 12:29.882
clever, eh Barnes?

12:29.882 --> 12:31.217
He sure is!

12:31.217 --> 12:33.185
Aren't' you, Snag, old boy?

12:38.924 --> 12:42.561
Well, Mr. Barnes,
I think we just watched

12:42.561 --> 12:46.065
our new 'Bob The
Wonder Dog', don't you?

12:46.065 --> 12:47.433
Absolutely, Mr. Sneer.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.369
That is a marvelously
well-trained dog.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.872
Oh, it's just a matter of

12:52.872 --> 12:54.707
giving him the
right encouragement.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.245
Pig 2: And about a
ton of doggie treats!

13:00.880 --> 13:02.748
If you'll
just sign here, Cyril.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.517
In triplicate, of course.

13:04.517 --> 13:08.120
Pigs! Stand up
and hold these contracts.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.861
Pig 3: Oooowww!!!
Pig 2: Oooowww!!!

13:15.861 --> 13:16.896
Pig 1: Oooowww!!!

13:16.896 --> 13:18.464
I can see where
the expression,

13:18.464 --> 13:21.767
"the pen is mightier than
the sword" came
from.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.402
There you
are, Mr. Barnes.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.138
Signed, sealed and delivered.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.074
Of course you realize
I'll have to take Snag with me

13:29.074 --> 13:30.442
to Hollywood, Cyril.

13:30.442 --> 13:31.911
I'll be able
to live with it.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.747
Just keep sending me
the cheques.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.782
I'm sure
going to miss him.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.218
Don't be so
sentimental, Cedric.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.686
And 'Bob
The Wonder Dog'

13:40.686 --> 13:42.822
is only the
beginning for Snag.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.391
I see movies, I see commercials,

13:45.391 --> 13:47.660
I see endorsements.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.762
And I see
a big bank account!

13:49.762 --> 13:53.165
I may have to put an
addition on my vault.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.600
Make a note of that, Cedric.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.935
Right, Pop.

13:55.935 --> 13:59.104
Pig 2: Here boy! Here Snag!

14:00.005 --> 14:03.409
Pig 1: Um.. we may
have a problem, boss.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.510
What is it?

14:04.510 --> 14:08.781
Pig 1: Um.. Snag seems
to have disappeared, Sir.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.150
Disappeared!? Oh great!

14:11.150 --> 14:13.519
I have a lot of money
riding on that mutt!

14:13.519 --> 14:15.287
I'll stall Barnes.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.790
You find Snag. Pronto!!

14:17.790 --> 14:20.025
Well, if
Snag's ready to go...

14:20.025 --> 14:22.194
Um.. say.. Mr. Barnes.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.631
Did I ever tell you about
my great-grandfather?

14:25.631 --> 14:27.666
He was in vaudeville you know,

14:27.666 --> 14:29.835
long before TV
ruined everything.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.040
Just think of it.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.109
Working for World Times!

14:37.109 --> 14:39.511
The newsmagazine!

14:39.511 --> 14:41.280
The places you'll go!

14:41.280 --> 14:42.681
The sights you'll see!

14:42.681 --> 14:44.984
Oh it's so exciting, Melissa.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.653
It's almost as good
as going myself.

14:47.653 --> 14:51.323
I wish I was as
enthusiastic as you are, Sophia.

14:51.323 --> 14:53.859
But I just don't
think I want to go.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.195
These assignments could take
me away from the forest

14:56.195 --> 14:57.863
for months at a time.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.299
I know you'll
miss Ralph and all of us,

15:00.299 --> 15:03.302
but after every job,
you'll come home.

15:03.302 --> 15:07.406
I know. But somehow,
I think I'm making a mistake.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.910
I'm not sure if this
is what I want to do.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.312
It's your
decision, Melissa.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.582
But nobody's giving me
a chance to decide for myself.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.217
Even Ralph.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.619
He's so sure this
is right for me.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.187
He's so proud.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.823
And everybody else
wants me to go too.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.359
Have you told
Ralph how you feel?

15:27.359 --> 15:30.396
Yes, but he says
I'm just a bit nervous.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.731
Maybe, he's right.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.400
Of course
he is, Melissa!

15:34.400 --> 15:36.001
Who wouldn't be nervous?

15:36.001 --> 15:37.903
But we're all rooting for you.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.239
And I know, you'll
make us all proud.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.775
You can't miss a
chance like this.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.209
No,

15:44.209 --> 15:45.577
I suppose not.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.249
Talented
bunch, aren't they?

15:50.249 --> 15:53.419
Mr. Sneer, this
is all very interesting,

15:53.419 --> 15:55.888
but I think we've
wasted enough time.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.257
Now, if you'll just
let me have Snag...

15:58.257 --> 15:59.858
I'll be on my way.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.027
Psst!! Psst!

16:03.762 --> 16:06.498
Just take a
gander at this next act.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.969
You might be able to fit it
into one of your TV shows.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.372
I guarantee you've never
seen anything like it.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.373
Whooaaa!!

16:14.373 --> 16:16.442
Ooommmfff!

16:16.442 --> 16:17.943
You're right there.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.712
Enjoy!

16:19.712 --> 16:20.779
Well?

16:20.779 --> 16:23.749
Pig 1: We found Snag, Sir.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.584
Pig 2: He's holed up
in the forest.

16:25.584 --> 16:28.887
Pig 3: And we can't just
talk him into coming back.

16:28.887 --> 16:32.157
I don't think he wants
to go to Hollywood, Pop.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.225
Yeah?

16:33.225 --> 16:35.627
Well, we'll see about that.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.998
I told the bears to keep
up the act for an hour.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.100
That ought to keep Barnes busy.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.835
Let's go!

16:45.838 --> 16:48.774
Well, Ralph? I, uh,

16:48.774 --> 16:50.409
I guess, it's time to go.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.178
I know it's tough
to leave, Melissa, but

16:53.178 --> 16:55.447
if you don't take
a shot at it now,

16:55.447 --> 16:58.417
someday you might regret it.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.086
I want you to
have this chance.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.858
Here Melissa, I thought
you might be able to use it.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.994
It can get cold out
there in the big world.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.763
Bert,
I'll be coming back

17:10.763 --> 17:12.498
after every assignment.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.134
Well, you talk as if
I was leaving forever.

17:15.134 --> 17:18.937
Well, I guess,
it just feels that way.

17:18.937 --> 17:20.105
Come on, Melissa,

17:20.105 --> 17:21.940
I'll walk you to the car.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.208
No, Ralph.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.011
It'll be easier
on both of us if I...

17:26.011 --> 17:27.813
just go now.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.154
Well, Melissa,
have you got everything?

17:35.154 --> 17:37.556
No. Not everything.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.325
There's a lot
I'm leaving behind.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.862
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:45.697 --> 17:47.833
Who was that maniac?

17:47.833 --> 17:50.069
That
was Cyril Sneer.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.806
And he's going somewhere
in a big hurry!

17:53.806 --> 17:55.674
I smell a story!

18:02.081 --> 18:04.583
Don't you want
to be a big star, Snag?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.919
Don't you want to be famous?

18:06.919 --> 18:10.155
Don't you want to make
me a lot of money?

18:11.623 --> 18:14.860
I've got a nice steak
here for you, Snag.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.568
Pig 3: Try doggie treats, Sir!

18:22.568 --> 18:24.103
I'm handling this!

18:24.603 --> 18:27.773
Snag, get out here,
you ungrateful mutt!

18:27.773 --> 18:29.775
I'm doing this
for your own good!!!

18:31.410 --> 18:32.444
Ahhh!!

18:33.579 --> 18:35.047
Uaaaaaaah!

18:40.119 --> 18:41.753
Pop!
Boss!!!

18:41.753 --> 18:45.257
Aaah! Oooh!

18:45.257 --> 18:46.525
Pop!

18:46.525 --> 18:48.627
Pig 3: Sir! Are you all right?

18:48.627 --> 18:50.596
No, you idiot!

18:50.596 --> 18:53.699
I'm pinned under
a flaming tree!

18:53.699 --> 18:55.634
Get me out of here!

18:55.634 --> 18:58.303
Cedric/Pigs:

18:58.303 --> 18:59.638
What a story!

18:59.638 --> 19:01.240
Get all this on film Melissa!

19:01.240 --> 19:02.741
It's your first assignment!

19:05.744 --> 19:07.579
Are you crazy, Melissa?!

19:07.579 --> 19:10.115
These photos could
make your career!

19:10.115 --> 19:12.651
Uaaah!

19:12.651 --> 19:15.654
Melissa! I thought,
you were gone!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.557
It's a
good thing I'm not!

19:18.557 --> 19:22.327
Will you can the reunion
and get me out of here!

19:22.327 --> 19:24.897
Mr. Roykirk,
get over here!

19:24.897 --> 19:27.132
We can't do it without you!

19:29.168 --> 19:32.271
One, two, three, heave!

19:34.740 --> 19:35.941
That's it, Snag!

19:35.941 --> 19:38.410
Pull!!...Pull!

19:38.410 --> 19:41.480
♪ (triumphant music) ♪

19:43.682 --> 19:45.784
Cyril!
Are you okay?

19:45.784 --> 19:48.520
Fine, fine. Thank you.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.091
Costs me a
fortune to feed Snag.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.660
It's ridiculous.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.566
That was a brave
thing you did, Melissa,

20:00.566 --> 20:03.502
but you didn't get the picture.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.304
What was
I supposed to do?

20:05.304 --> 20:07.539
Just stand by and watch?

20:07.539 --> 20:10.108
Photographers on
assignment for World Times

20:10.108 --> 20:12.211
do just that, Melissa.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.514
In our magazine, the
photograph is everything.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.717
Well, Mr. Roykirk,
in the Eevergreen forest

20:18.717 --> 20:21.653
there are some things more
important than photographs!

20:21.653 --> 20:23.722
Easy now, Pop.

20:28.327 --> 20:31.797
Wow, Melissa
would love... this story.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.533
You can clip it
out and save it for her.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.201
She'll be back soon...

20:36.201 --> 20:38.036
I guess.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.305
Melissa!

20:40.305 --> 20:42.641
W-what are you doing here?

20:42.641 --> 20:45.244
I got fired
from my first assignment!

20:45.244 --> 20:46.912
Isn't that wonderful?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.815
Oh,
I'm sorry, Melissa.

20:49.815 --> 20:50.816
Well, I'm not!

20:50.816 --> 20:52.784
Something happened
to make me realize,

20:52.784 --> 20:56.255
I'm the one who has
to make my own decisions.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.056
I know you all meant well.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.559
But you were putting
all your hopes on me,

21:00.559 --> 21:02.261
forgetting what I might want.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.697
And I've decided I know
what I want, for now.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.366
What's that, Melissa?

21:07.366 --> 21:11.837
I want one of Bert's
peanut butter sandwich specials,

21:11.837 --> 21:14.206
and a nice hot cup of tea!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.709
One special, comin' up!

21:17.709 --> 21:20.512
I should have
listened to you, Melissa.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.847
I'm sorry.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.716
Boy, am I glad you're back!

21:24.716 --> 21:26.385
Yah, me too, Melissa.

21:26.385 --> 21:29.521
You're the only one who
appreciates my cooking.

21:29.521 --> 21:30.889
Oh, Bert!

21:33.091 --> 21:35.260
Success and happiness
are two things

21:35.260 --> 21:38.664
that people sometimes spend
a long time looking for.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.933
They might find it in some
far-off part of the world,

21:41.933 --> 21:46.138
and then again, they might find
it in their own backyard.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.374
I understand
you had to leave, Barnes.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.878
It's just as well,
because I don't think
