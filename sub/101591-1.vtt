WEBVTT

00:51.166 --> 00:53.166
[crowd cheering]

00:59.750 --> 01:03.083
I have today ordered
to Vietnam the Airmobile Division

01:03.833 --> 01:07.208
and certain other forces
which will raise our fighting strength

01:07.291 --> 01:13.666
from 75,000 to 125,000 men
almost immediately.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.458
This will make it necessary
to increase our active fighting forces

01:17.541 --> 01:23.208
by raising the monthly draft call
from 17,000 to 35,000.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.583
December 30th.

01:27.666 --> 01:30.416
[announcer] All those whose birthday
falls on December 30th.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.166
[reporter 1] President Johnson
announced new monthly draft totals

01:33.250 --> 01:34.750
increasing to 35,000 per month.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.708
-[reporter 2] 43,000 per month…
-[reporter 3] 51,000…

01:36.791 --> 01:42.083
[reporter 4] 382,386 men between the ages
of 18 and 24 have been called to duty.

01:42.166 --> 01:45.000
[Martin Luther King Jr.]
Now it should be incandescently clear

01:45.083 --> 01:50.250
that no one who has any concern for
the integrity and life of America today

01:50.333 --> 01:52.541
can ignore the present war.

01:52.625 --> 01:55.750
If America's soul
becomes totally poisoned,

01:55.833 --> 01:59.458
part of the autopsy must read, "Vietnam."

01:59.541 --> 02:00.375
[gunshot]

02:00.458 --> 02:02.833
What we need
in the United States is not hatred,

02:02.916 --> 02:05.458
but is love and wisdom.

02:05.541 --> 02:08.750
So I ask you tonight to return home,

02:08.833 --> 02:12.583
to say a prayer for the family
of Martin Luther King.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.583
-[gunshot]
-[people screaming]

02:17.083 --> 02:18.666
August 24th.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.416
[announcer]
All those whose birthday falls…

02:20.500 --> 02:22.833
[reporter] Another 30,000 troops
have been deployed to the region.

02:22.916 --> 02:25.916
This, after the US saw its greatest
increase in monthly casualties.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.625
[Rennie]
What we saw were population centers.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.958
Schoolhouses, pagodas, women and children.

02:32.291 --> 02:34.875
And that's American napalm.

02:34.958 --> 02:38.291
Women and children were burned alive. Tom?

02:39.750 --> 02:41.500
The Democratic Party

02:41.583 --> 02:45.333
is gonna end up nominating Hubert Humphrey
next month in Chicago.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.666
Now, when it comes to the war
and social justice,

02:50.333 --> 02:52.416
there is simply not enough of a difference

02:52.500 --> 02:54.916
between Humphrey and Nixon
to make a difference.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.833
And so, we're going to Chicago.

02:56.916 --> 02:59.916
Young people, by busloads,
will go to Chicago

03:00.000 --> 03:03.333
to show our solidarity and our disgust.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.916
But most importantly…

03:05.000 --> 03:07.791
-To get laid by someone you just met.
-[crowd laughs]

03:07.875 --> 03:11.458
536,000 of us sent to a country

03:11.541 --> 03:14.958
none of these bumper-sticker patriots
in Washington could find on a map

03:15.041 --> 03:16.458
with a motherfuckin' map!

03:16.541 --> 03:18.166
[crowd cheers]

03:18.250 --> 03:19.875
We're goin' to Chicago.

03:19.958 --> 03:23.416
Anyone who stays in the park,
sings Woody Guthrie, they'll be fine.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.416
[crowd laughs]

03:24.500 --> 03:27.833
But the cops are gonna be a half-inch
from losin' their fuckin' minds,

03:27.916 --> 03:30.166
'cause Daley's gonna wind 'em up
to make sure of it.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.791
We're goin' to Chicago peacefully.
We're goin' peacefully.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.166
But if we're met there with violence,

03:36.250 --> 03:39.583
you better believe that we're gonna
meet that violence with…

03:39.666 --> 03:43.083
Nonviolence. Always nonviolence,
and that's without exception.

03:43.166 --> 03:46.541
-[boy] What if the police hit you?
-[David] Why would the police hit me?

03:46.625 --> 03:47.833
-What if they do?
-I'll duck.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.875
David, he watches the news.

03:49.958 --> 03:51.250
I've organized 100 protests.

03:51.333 --> 03:55.125
This one will be no different
in that it almost certainly won't work.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.291
The police are--

03:56.375 --> 03:59.166
I'm not worried about them.
I'm worried about Hoffman and Rubin.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.583
It's the Democratic
National Convention, honey.

04:01.666 --> 04:04.083
Every camera in America
is gonna be pointed at it,

04:04.166 --> 04:07.375
and Daley is not gonna let his city
turn into a theater of war.

04:07.458 --> 04:10.125
Hoffman and Rubin
are geniuses in their own special way.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.416
-Oh, dear God.
-He's got a Boy Scout meeting at 7:00.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.791
Dad, if the police--

04:14.875 --> 04:16.166
If the police try to arrest me,

04:16.250 --> 04:19.458
I'll do what I always do and what
I taught you to do, which is what?

04:20.625 --> 04:22.875
Very calmly and very politely…

04:22.958 --> 04:26.333
Fuck the motherfuckers up!
They leave us alone and everything's cool.

04:26.416 --> 04:27.875
They tangle, disrupt, intimidate,

04:27.958 --> 04:30.000
play fast and loose
with the First Amendment,

04:30.083 --> 04:32.500
start breaking heads,
then we will not be on our way.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.250
You can't give this speech in Chicago.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.791
-Fred wants me there. Plane ticket.
-Let Fred give the speech.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.083
Between Hayden and Hoffman,
there could be 5,000 people.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.625
Be nice to talk to 5,000 people.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.500
Not while you're in trouble
in Connecticut.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.750
I'm the head
of the Black Panthers, Sondra.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.750
When won't I be in trouble? Travel bag.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.875
You'll be in a lot more of it
if you stand up and say, "Fry the pigs."

04:50.958 --> 04:52.750
If they attack. Takin' it out of context.

04:52.833 --> 04:56.166
So will every white person in America.
Cops won't give a shit about context.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.791
You don't have protection in Chicago.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.416
There's no place to be but in it.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.416
-But "fry the pigs"?
-If they attack--

05:01.500 --> 05:02.958
-Dr. King--
-Is dead.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.833
He has a dream?
Now he has a fuckin' bullet in his head.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.958
Martin's dead, Malcolm's dead,
Medgar's dead,

05:08.041 --> 05:09.791
Bobby's dead, Jesus is dead.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.333
They tried it peacefully,
we gonna try something else.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.208
Sondra, I'll be there for four hours.
That's it.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.541
Snack.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.916
You'll at least take one of these?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.041
If I knew how to use that,
I wouldn't need to be making speeches.

05:30.083 --> 05:34.541
It's named after the Russian commissar
Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.041
You start with a glass bottle.

05:38.416 --> 05:41.083
You fill it up halfway
with gasoline and motor oil…

05:44.666 --> 05:47.500
You pack some Styrofoam,
and now your cherry bomb.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.708
Some chewing gum around the top…

05:54.708 --> 05:55.958
…and a fuse.

05:56.041 --> 05:56.875
[man] Now!

06:00.458 --> 06:04.083
[reporter] The 35th National Democratic
Convention is set to begin next week

06:04.166 --> 06:07.625
with repeated assurances
from Chicago Mayor, Richard J. Daley.

06:07.708 --> 06:11.083
-Will it be a good convention, Mr. Mayor?
-The best ever held.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.916
-Is that Jerry?
-[Rennie] Yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.916
Tell him to tell Abbie
we're going to Chicago to end the war

06:16.000 --> 06:17.458
and not to fuck around.

06:17.541 --> 06:20.416
Tom says to tell Abbie
that we're going to Chicago to end the war

06:20.500 --> 06:22.041
and not to fuck around.

06:22.583 --> 06:26.333
Hayden says we're goin' to Chicago
to end the war and not to fuck around.

06:26.416 --> 06:29.291
[Abbie] Tell Hayden I went to Brandeis
and I can do both.

06:29.375 --> 06:33.250
We're going to show that we,
as a generation, are serious people.

06:33.333 --> 06:37.833
People say, "Abbie, are you concerned
about an overreaction from the cops?"

06:37.916 --> 06:41.041
I issued a police order
to shoot to kill any arsonists.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.583
We're not concerned about it.

06:42.666 --> 06:45.958
[reporter 1] Four units of the Illinois
National Guard, totaling 5,000 troops,

06:46.041 --> 06:47.458
have been sent to Chicago.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.708
We're countin' on it!

06:48.791 --> 06:52.208
We wanna underscore again
that we're coming to Chicago peacefully,

06:52.291 --> 06:55.000
but whether we're given permits
or not, we're coming.

06:55.083 --> 06:58.625
[reporter 2] An additional 10,000 Chicago
police officers, including riot squads…

06:58.708 --> 07:01.458
We're not going to storm the convention
with tanks or mace,

07:01.541 --> 07:04.625
but we are going to storm the hearts
and minds of the American people.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.958
These people are revolutionaries

07:07.041 --> 07:10.375
bent on the destruction of the government
of the United States of America.

07:10.458 --> 07:15.666
The Democratic Convention
is about to begin in a police state.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.458
There just doesn't seem to be
any other way to say it.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.916
[secretary]
You've arrived at a moment in history.

07:44.416 --> 07:47.208
-Pardon?
-They're changing the picture.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.666
[typewriter keys clicking]

07:51.666 --> 07:52.708
[door opens]

07:53.708 --> 07:55.333
-Tom.
-[Foran] Howard.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.875
-Flew in all right?
-Sure.

07:57.416 --> 07:58.958
-Richard Schultz?
-Yes, sir.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.541
Howard Ackerman, Special Advisor
to the Attorney General.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.916
-Pleased to meet you.
-Anyone tell you what this is about?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.708
No, sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at O'Hare
this morning, we'd fly to Washington.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.708
-We'd be meeting Mr. Mitchell.
-Good.

08:10.666 --> 08:14.125
Finally changing that goddamn picture.
Come on in.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.500
[Mitchell] As a matter
of courtesy and tradition,

08:21.583 --> 08:25.125
when we elect a new president,
the outgoing cabinet members resign

08:25.208 --> 08:28.291
to spare the new president
the unpleasantness of firing 'em.

08:28.916 --> 08:31.041
Richard, do you know when President Nixon

08:31.125 --> 08:34.000
received Ramsey Clark's
formal letter of resignation?

08:34.541 --> 08:37.125
-No, sir.
-About an hour before my confirmation.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.791
That was to embarrass me.

08:38.875 --> 08:42.250
I don't know, I think it was
more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.250
I'm John Mitchell.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.958
Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General,
and this is Richard Schultz.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.708
Richard, Chicago is more fucked up than
any ten things I've ever seen in my life.

08:49.791 --> 08:51.666
-[Schultz] Sir?
-The convention, the riots.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.375
-Yes, sir.
-[Mitchell] Sit.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.833
-Johnnie Walker okay with everybody?
-Yes, thank you.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.625
-Richard?
-Nothing for me, thank you.

08:59.708 --> 09:03.000
We don't know how Humphrey's people
could have been that stupid.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.625
Allow their guy
to be nominated under armed guard.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.666
-Sir?
-Son, are you nervous?

09:08.750 --> 09:10.416
-No, sir.
-Why the fuck not?

09:11.833 --> 09:15.208
[chuckles] I'm kidding. Don't believe
everything you've heard about me.

09:15.291 --> 09:19.583
Ramsey Clark gave me the finger
on the way out the door. [scoffs]

09:19.666 --> 09:22.916
I'm asking if you think Chicago
was why Humphrey lost the election.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.500
No, sir.
The Republicans ran a better candidate.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.666
-That's for damn sure.
-Daley didn't help his party,

09:27.750 --> 09:29.875
but Humphrey's people
and Daley didn't break the law,

09:29.958 --> 09:31.333
so that's somebody else's table.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.916
As a matter of fact, we don't believe
any federal laws were broken last summer.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.916
Mr. Foran had our office
run a thorough investigation.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.458
There was trespassing, destruction
of public property, lewd behavior.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.500
Nothing that would rise to the level--

09:43.583 --> 09:46.208
You think you and your boss
are in the attorney general's office

09:46.291 --> 09:50.458
because I want you to seek an indictment
for violating a federal trespassing law?

09:51.333 --> 09:53.708
Our office wasn't aware
that the Justice Department

09:53.791 --> 09:55.416
wanted to seek any indictments at all.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.416
-We do.
-Ramsey Clark was dead set against--

09:57.500 --> 09:59.791
Ramsey Clark doesn't run
the Justice Department anymore,

09:59.875 --> 10:00.958
did you hear about that?

10:01.041 --> 10:03.583
-And Mr. Johnson's back home in Texas.
-Of course, sir.

10:03.666 --> 10:06.125
One hour before
my confirmation hearing gaveled,

10:06.208 --> 10:08.500
that's when he resigned. What a prick!

10:09.375 --> 10:10.500
That's unprofessional.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.666
Unprofessional? It was unpatriotic.
I'll tell you what else.

10:13.750 --> 10:17.250
It was impolite.
There's such a thing as manners.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.708
I want to bring back manners.
How about that? The America I grew up in.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.791
Will you help me, Mr. Schultz?

10:22.875 --> 10:26.041
'Cause I asked Mr. Foran
who was the best prosecutor in his office.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.875
-He said you.
-Thank you.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.875
Section 2101 of Title 18.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.916
That's the federal law that was broken.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.625
That's the Rap Brown Law.

10:34.708 --> 10:38.333
In conspiracy to cross state lines
in order to incite violence.

10:38.416 --> 10:41.458
Comes with a maximum of ten years.
We want all ten.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.666
-For whom, sir?
-The all-star team.

10:46.333 --> 10:50.333
"Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin,
David Dellinger, Rennie Davis,

10:50.416 --> 10:54.166
Lee Weiner, John Froines…
and Bobby Seale?"

10:54.250 --> 10:58.250
I call 'em the school boys, and when I do,
everyone here knows who I'm talking about.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.166
Petulant and dangerous.

11:00.250 --> 11:03.833
And we watched for a decade
while these rebels without a job,

11:03.916 --> 11:06.541
who never got their hands dirty
fighting the enemy,

11:06.625 --> 11:09.041
tell us how to prosecute a war.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.000
The decade's over, the grown-ups are back,

11:12.083 --> 11:16.750
and I deem these shitty little fairies 
to be a threat to national security.

11:16.833 --> 11:20.375
So they're gonna spend their thirties
in a federal facility.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.708
-Real-time.
-[Foran] You're lead prosecutor, Richard.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.666
You understand
why I couldn't tell you until we got here?

11:25.750 --> 11:26.833
Sure. Of course, sir.

11:26.916 --> 11:31.083
Richard, you're being handed the ball.
Are you ready for this?

11:33.583 --> 11:34.916
You pay me for my opinion.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.916
-What?
-I said, sir, you pay me for my opinion.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.583
Where'd you learn that?
In class? I pay you to win.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.166
I'm not sure we can get
a good indictment on conspiracy.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.958
-Why not?
-Some of them have never met each other.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.291
Telephones.

11:48.541 --> 11:53.458
Mr. Attorney General, the Rap Brown Law
was created by Southern whites in Congress

11:53.541 --> 11:55.916
to limit the free speech
of Black activists.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.166
-Civil rights activists--
-I know why it was passed.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.791
Why the fuck is he teaching…

11:59.875 --> 12:03.041
It doesn't matter why it was passed.
It matters what it can do.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.916
We're not sure what it can do.
No one's ever been charged with it.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.416
[Foran] That makes it exciting.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.208
It's like virgin land.
Undeveloped real estate.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.500
-It's a law and they broke it.
-Of course, sir.

12:13.583 --> 12:14.833
-Is there a problem?
-No, sir.

12:14.916 --> 12:17.916
Say what you want to say,
since I'm paying for your wisdom.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.333
Give me my money's worth.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.208
Sir, there are people who will see this

12:21.291 --> 12:23.583
as the Justice Department
restraining free speech

12:23.666 --> 12:26.500
and there were people
who see these men as martyrs.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.875
-Are any of those people in this room?
-No, sir.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.666
You're 33 and you're about
to be named lead prosecutor

12:31.750 --> 12:33.916
in the most important trial
in your lifetime

12:34.000 --> 12:36.875
after being handpicked
by the attorney general.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.791
I'm about to do that right now.

12:38.875 --> 12:42.958
But before I do, let me ask you,
how do you see them?

12:43.875 --> 12:46.166
-Personally or in terms of--
-[Mitchell] Personally.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.583
I see them as vulgar, anti-establishment,

12:48.666 --> 12:52.291
antisocial and unpragmatic,
but none of those things are indictable.

12:52.375 --> 12:54.833
Imagine how impressed I'll be
when you get an indictment.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.458
-There's a bigger question.
-Which is?

12:57.541 --> 13:01.375
Who started the riots?
Was it the protesters or the police?

13:01.458 --> 13:04.666
-The police don't start riots.
-They'll have witnesses who say they did.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.875
And you'll dismantle them and win,

13:06.958 --> 13:10.208
because, Mr. Schultz,
that's what's expected of you.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.375
[Foran] You didn't show
a lot of gratitude in there.

13:15.458 --> 13:16.333
[Schultz sighs]

13:16.416 --> 13:20.750
On top of everything, we're giving them
what they want: a stage and an audience.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.500
You think there's gonna be a big audience?

13:23.583 --> 13:27.125
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!

13:27.208 --> 13:28.458
Yes, sir, I do.

13:29.166 --> 13:33.583
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!

13:34.625 --> 13:37.458
-[protestor 1] Traitors!
-[protestor 2] Lock up the longhairs!

13:37.541 --> 13:39.541
[protestor 3] Power to the people!

13:39.625 --> 13:41.083
[protestor 4] No more war!

13:44.125 --> 13:47.458
[crowd] The whole world is watching!

13:48.041 --> 13:50.583
Get out! How dare you? Get out!

13:51.583 --> 13:53.083
-[man 1] Abbie!
-Are you all right?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.291
[man 2] Abbie, over here.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.708
-I was, until I saw that.
-Most of them are on our side.

13:57.791 --> 13:59.875
-[man 2] We love you, Abbie!
-See?

14:01.083 --> 14:01.916
[woman] Watch out!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.750
Jesus Christ! How did you do that?

14:05.625 --> 14:06.625
Experience.

14:06.708 --> 14:09.708
[reporter 1] Abbie, right over here!

14:09.791 --> 14:11.208
Over here! Over here!

14:11.291 --> 14:13.166
You don't know what to do
with the egg now?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.083
No.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.291
[elevator bell dings]

14:16.208 --> 14:19.750
-[reporter 2] Mr. Kunstler, one question!
-[reporter 3] Bill! Bill!

14:19.833 --> 14:22.416
All right. Hang on. Quiet down.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.958
I want you all to meet
a new addition to the defense team.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.166
This is Leonard Weinglass,

14:28.250 --> 14:31.458
one of this country's most
talented First Amendment litigators.

14:31.541 --> 14:34.000
-Bill, can you tell us--
-Go ahead, Sy.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.541
What's the status of Charles Garry?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.375
Charles Garry is still in the hospital.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.375
You should contact his office
for information.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.958
-[reporter 4] One more.
-Marjorie.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.791
You're representing Bobby Seale today?

14:44.875 --> 14:48.833
Oh, no, it's very important
that it be understood that, uh,

14:48.916 --> 14:51.541
for his own protection,
his own protection,

14:51.625 --> 14:54.541
I will not be acting as
Bobby Seale's attorney today.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.458
One more. Jack.

14:55.541 --> 14:59.291
I was told that Hayden was the one
who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass in,

14:59.375 --> 15:02.041
that Hayden has concerns
about your seriousness.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.625
-Well…
-This is William Kunstler.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.833
You wanna find out how serious he is,
meet him at a witness stand.

15:07.916 --> 15:09.875
[indistinct chatter]

15:42.291 --> 15:45.458
I understand why they're tryin'
to smoke Abbie, Jerry and Hayden,

15:45.541 --> 15:46.875
even Rennie and Dellinger,

15:46.958 --> 15:49.833
but I can't figure out
what the two of us are doin' here.

15:49.916 --> 15:53.708
I feel exactly the same way, but
this is the Academy Awards of protests,

15:53.791 --> 15:57.041
and as far as I'm concerned,
it's an honor just to be nominated.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.458
What is that?

16:00.333 --> 16:02.041
I've been keeping a list every day.

16:02.583 --> 16:05.583
Americans who've been killed
since the day we were arrested.

16:05.666 --> 16:06.500
Why?

16:07.291 --> 16:10.958
With the trial starting, it might get easy
to forget who this is about.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.666
-[Bill] Fellas.
-Morning.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.666
Good morning.

16:26.541 --> 16:29.583
I just got a question
about my seriousness.

16:30.125 --> 16:34.625
Whatever's going on between you and Abbie,
could you keep it out of this building?

16:34.708 --> 16:37.708
-I got a feeling this is gearing up to be…
-[door opens]

16:38.916 --> 16:40.875
-[door closes]
-[footsteps approaching]

16:41.916 --> 16:44.375
[spectators murmuring]

17:01.250 --> 17:03.166
-Fred.
-Bill.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.833
Did you have breakfast this morning?

17:08.208 --> 17:10.250
-What?
-Did you have breakfast?

17:10.875 --> 17:13.250
-I did.
-Well, what'd you have?

17:13.916 --> 17:14.875
What are you doin'?

17:14.958 --> 17:16.500
I'm talkin' to him about breakfast

17:16.583 --> 17:19.125
because that's all I'm allowed
to talk to him about.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.208
That's right.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.958
-Bobby--
-We have instructions from our lawyer.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.708
If you need me, I'm sittin' right there.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.708
You just look at me
and you say, "I need you."

17:30.666 --> 17:33.333
-We don't need you, Bill.
-You two gonna be like this?

17:34.791 --> 17:38.208
Your friends shouldn't sit together.
The jury's not gonna like that.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.083
This isn't my jury.
If they don't like it--

17:40.166 --> 17:41.208
No, he's right.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.916
Spread out, okay? In pairs.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.541
[Bill] And Fred?

17:50.916 --> 17:53.291
-No, they're dressed just fine.
-It's all right.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.625
And take your very scary hats off.

18:01.666 --> 18:02.625
Don't mess this up.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.833
All right. Good pep talk.

18:11.000 --> 18:11.833
Hey!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.291
You see the crowd out there?

18:17.250 --> 18:18.458
I have an egg.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.875
-Get rid of that.
-You don't think I want to?

18:20.958 --> 18:23.708
It's like we're… What's his name?
We just met him.

18:23.791 --> 18:25.750
-Yeah.
-What is his name?

18:25.833 --> 18:28.333
-Who?
-The drummer. The greatest drummer ever.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.250
Gene Krupa?

18:29.333 --> 18:32.125
No. Gene Krupa? I'm talkin' about
the drummer from Cream.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.625
We just met him last night.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.625
-Ginger Baker.
-Thank you.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.666
Crowd outside is so big, it's as if
we're Ginger Baker, I was trying to say.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.875
-Are you stoned?
-Yeah. You?

18:44.375 --> 18:45.375
All right, sit down.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.416
You remember what I said.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.666
Okay, and you remember
to keep us out of prison.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.583
[Bill] There's a lot of good advice
this morning.

18:56.666 --> 18:57.708
[bailiff] All rise.

19:05.541 --> 19:10.500
Hear ye, hear ye.
September 26th, 1969, ten o'clock a.m.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.375
All persons having business
before the United States District Court

19:13.458 --> 19:15.833
of Northern Illinois,
Southern District, Eastern Division,

19:15.916 --> 19:17.791
draw near and ye shall be heard.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.875
Judge Julius Hoffman presiding.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.791
God save the United States of America
and this Honorable Court.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.083
Be seated.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.666
Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.458
Let the record show
that we have been joined

19:44.541 --> 19:48.083
by our 12 jurors and four alternates.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.500
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.041
Good morning.

19:52.666 --> 19:55.750
Mrs. Winter, please call the case.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.750
69 CR 180,

19:58.833 --> 20:03.375
United States of America
v. David Dellinger,

20:03.458 --> 20:06.541
Rennard C. Davis, Thomas Hayden,

20:06.625 --> 20:09.791
Abbott Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin,

20:09.875 --> 20:15.625
Lee Weiner, John R. Froines
and Bobby G. Seale for trial.

20:15.708 --> 20:18.041
Are the People ready
to make opening arguments?

20:18.125 --> 20:19.083
We are, Your Honor.

20:19.166 --> 20:22.375
-I don't have my lawyer here.
-It's not your turn to speak.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.250
My trial's begun without my lawyer.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.833
-Please sit.
-[spectators murmuring]

20:31.875 --> 20:32.750
Mr. Schultz?

20:36.041 --> 20:38.541
Good morning.
My name is Richard Schultz.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.625
I'm an assistant US attorney
for the Southern District of Illinois.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.583
Seated at my table is my boss,
US Attorney Thomas Foran.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.958
Or you could say, I'm seated at his table.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.291
[jurors chuckle softly]

20:48.375 --> 20:50.916
At the defense table
are the eight defendants

20:51.000 --> 20:54.458
represented by their lawyers
William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass.

20:55.458 --> 20:59.708
Now, the defendants would tell you that
they represent three different groups.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.375
-They would tell you that one group is--
-[Hoffman] Excuse me.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.000
Yes, sir.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.208
I'd like to clarify something
for the jurors.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.041
There are two Hoffmans in this courtroom.

21:10.125 --> 21:14.791
The defendant Abbie Hoffman
and myself, Judge Julius Hoffman.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.583
Thank you, sir.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.166
I didn't want there to be
confusion on the matter.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.500
Man, I don't think
they're gonna mix us up.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.000
[spectators laughing]

21:23.083 --> 21:25.833
You will address this court
as Judge or Your Honor,

21:25.916 --> 21:28.833
and you will not
address this court until…

21:28.916 --> 21:30.666
You will not address this court!

21:33.291 --> 21:36.250
The defendants would tell you
they represent three different groups.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.500
[Hoffman] And the record should reflect

21:38.583 --> 21:42.583
that defendant Hoffman and I
are not related.

21:42.666 --> 21:44.083
Father, no!

21:44.166 --> 21:45.500
-[spectators laugh]
-[gavel bangs]

21:45.583 --> 21:48.708
Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar
with contempt of court?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.541
-It's practically a religion for me, sir.
-[spectators laugh]

21:53.791 --> 21:55.750
-Your Honor?
-Continue.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.500
Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden
are the leaders of the SDS,

22:02.583 --> 22:04.375
Students for a Democratic Society.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.708
Davis and Hayden
brought their people to Chicago

22:07.791 --> 22:10.500
for the purpose
of causing violence in the streets

22:10.583 --> 22:13.166
in order to disrupt
the Democratic Convention.

22:13.250 --> 22:16.125
You know the Youth International Party
as the Yippies.

22:16.875 --> 22:19.541
Their leaders are
Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

22:19.625 --> 22:23.000
Bobby Seale is the leader
of the Black Panther Party.

22:23.583 --> 22:27.416
Again, the defendants would tell you
that these are three distinct groups.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.333
-But they all--
-[Bobby] Excuse me.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.250
[Hoffman] Yes.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.458
-May I speak?
-[Hoffman] No, sir.

22:32.541 --> 22:33.625
He just said my name.

22:33.708 --> 22:37.458
You're a defendant in this case.
You're likely to hear your name.

22:37.541 --> 22:41.291
I have a right to counsel,
and His Honor knows that.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.541
Don't tell the court what it does
and does not know. Be seated.

22:48.875 --> 22:50.250
Mr. Schultz.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.625
The radical left. That's all.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.750
They're the radical left
in different costumes.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.583
These defendants had a plan,

22:59.666 --> 23:02.500
and a plan among two or more people
is a conspiracy.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.708
The defendants crossed state lines
to execute their plan.

23:05.791 --> 23:09.333
That's why we're in federal court,
and the plan was to incite a riot,

23:09.416 --> 23:11.750
and there's one thing you already know.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.583
They succeeded.

23:13.666 --> 23:18.708
Excuse me. Have we identified
the other defendants for the record?

23:19.541 --> 23:21.208
A Mr… Wiener.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.666
Weiner.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.250
-[spectators laugh]
-[Hoffman] Mr. Froines and Mr. Dillinger.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.458
Dellinger, Your Honor.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.291
What's going on here?

23:28.375 --> 23:30.750
Uh, you're referring
to the defendant Dellinger.

23:30.833 --> 23:34.083
-Derringer.
-Um, it's Dellinger, sir.

23:34.166 --> 23:39.291
Note the prosecution was referring
to the defendant Derringer.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.916
-Not Dellinger.
-It is Dellinger, Your Honor.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.916
[Hoffman] Can we straighten this out?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.833
Sure. Dillinger was a bank robber.
Derringer is a gun.

23:47.916 --> 23:50.916
He's David Dellinger,
and the judge and I are not related.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.500
Your Honor, I'd like to caution the court
that this kind of disruption

23:54.583 --> 23:58.166
and display of disrespect
will be a continuing tactic for defense.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.500
[Bill] Sir, it's not a tactic.
At the moment,

24:00.583 --> 24:03.750
the defendants are the only ones
on record as knowing their own names.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.583
[Hoffman] Be seated, Mr. Schultz…

24:05.666 --> 24:07.833
Uh, Mr. Kunstler.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.291
I object to being characterized
as a member of this group.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.708
-Who is your lawyer?
-[Bobby] Charles R. Garry.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.625
Is Mr. Garry here today?

24:16.708 --> 24:18.083
-No, he is not.
-Your Honor--

24:18.166 --> 24:19.708
Are you representing Mr. Seale?

24:19.791 --> 24:21.541
-No, sir.
-[Hoffman] Then, sit.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.083
-Mr. Schultz, forgive me.
-[indistinct conversation]

24:26.625 --> 24:28.791
Have you concluded your opening statement?

24:29.708 --> 24:30.833
Yes, Your Honor.

24:30.916 --> 24:33.583
My lawyer Charles Garry
is in a hospital in Oakland

24:33.666 --> 24:35.541
having undergone gallbladder surgery.

24:35.625 --> 24:36.791
[Hoffman] Mr. Kunstler.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.666
You are sitting right next to the man.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.125
Just represent him.
It's the same case.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.041
The fact that there's a lawyer
near Mr. Seale

24:45.125 --> 24:47.625
does not satisfy
the requirements of due process.

24:47.708 --> 24:48.791
I have a right--

24:48.875 --> 24:53.833
A motion was made for postponement
due to Mr. Garry's medical condition.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.625
I was there.
Your Honor denied that motion.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.791
Therefore, Mr. Seale is here
without legal representation.

24:59.875 --> 25:04.666
I don't care
for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.041
I meant no disrespect to the court.

25:07.125 --> 25:11.583
I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy
Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal

25:11.666 --> 25:13.500
by appearing to speak as his lawyer.

25:13.583 --> 25:17.041
I don't ask you to compromise
Mr. Seale's position, sir.

25:17.125 --> 25:21.416
But I will not permit him
to address the jury

25:21.500 --> 25:23.958
when his perfectly competent lawyer
is sitting--

25:24.041 --> 25:26.416
For the fourth time,
he's not Bobby's lawyer.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.291
You're, uh… Mr. Rubin.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.041
Yes, sir.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.583
Don't ever do that again!

25:37.333 --> 25:39.166
[Bobby] Your Honor,
I'm not with these guys.

25:39.250 --> 25:42.250
I never met most of them
until the indictment.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.666
-We will have order.
-There are eight of us here.

25:44.750 --> 25:48.708
There are signs out there that read,
"Free the Chicago 7." I'm not with them!

25:48.791 --> 25:52.791
-Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr. Seale?
-Conspiracy? I never met most of them.

25:52.875 --> 25:56.500
Frankly, the US attorney wanted
a Negro defendant to scare the jury.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.000
I was thrown in
to make the group look scarier.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.125
I came to Chicago. I made a speech!

26:01.208 --> 26:02.958
-Mr. Seale--
-I had a chicken pot pie,

26:03.041 --> 26:05.375
went to the airport
and I flew back to Oakland,

26:05.458 --> 26:07.000
that's why they call it the Chicago…

26:07.083 --> 26:08.916
-[gavel banging]
-Get your hands off me!

26:09.000 --> 26:12.833
Charge Mr. Seale
with one count of contempt of court.

26:36.541 --> 26:37.875
[door slams]

26:38.541 --> 26:40.208
We have to make a decision right now,

26:40.291 --> 26:44.333
a decision I assumed we'd already made
four months ago when trial prep began.

26:44.416 --> 26:48.666
Are we using this trial to defend
ourselves against very serious charges

26:48.750 --> 26:50.500
that could land us in prison
for ten years?

26:51.583 --> 26:54.500
Or to say a pointless "fuck you"
to the establishment?

26:54.583 --> 26:57.666
-Fuck you!
-That is what I was afraid…

26:58.541 --> 27:01.541
-Were you saying "fuck you" or answering--
-I was also confused.

27:01.625 --> 27:05.125
If we leave without saying anything
about why we came in the first place,

27:05.208 --> 27:06.291
it'll be heartbreaking.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.708
If the jury finds us guilty,
we're not leaving at all.

27:08.791 --> 27:11.375
The only thing we need to say
about why we came here

27:11.458 --> 27:13.208
is it wasn't to incite violence.

27:14.000 --> 27:14.916
I'm with Jerry.

27:16.083 --> 27:18.708
-Why?
-The trial shouldn't be about us.

27:18.791 --> 27:22.250
I would love it if it wasn't about us,
but it definitely is. John? Lee?

27:22.875 --> 27:24.625
Does anyone think our judge is crazy?

27:24.708 --> 27:27.166
-He isn't our problem.
-Give it time. He will be.

27:27.250 --> 27:31.166
I'm talking about us.
Abbie, you cannot talk back to the judge.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.583
-And, Jerry… Jesus!
-Did you get a haircut just for court?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.916
-I did.
-A haircut for the judge. That is…

27:39.666 --> 27:42.000
[laughs] I can't even. That is…

27:42.083 --> 27:43.750
That is so foreign to me.

27:43.833 --> 27:45.333
-So is soap.
-Zing.

27:45.416 --> 27:48.583
Let me explain something. It took
you two less than five minutes

27:48.666 --> 27:52.416
to make us look exactly like what Schultz
is trying to make us look like.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.625
I don't have a problem
with what we look like.

27:54.708 --> 27:57.291
Jerry likes what we look like. Uh, John?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.458
-Lee?
-Yeah.

27:58.541 --> 28:02.125
-I feel like I'm ten pounds too heavy.
-I don't like it when we fight.

28:02.208 --> 28:04.000
-Rennie?
-Tom should be heard.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.041
[Abbie] And he was.

28:05.625 --> 28:10.125
When we walked in here, they were chanting
that the whole world is watching.

28:10.208 --> 28:11.916
This is it. We're on.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.166
This is what revolution looks like.
Real revolution. Cultural revolution.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.791
Why did you come here?

28:17.875 --> 28:19.791
I got an invitation from a grand jury.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.916
Last summer.
Why did you come to the convention?

28:22.916 --> 28:24.416
To end the war.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.750
Guys, before you tether yourselves
to this man,

28:26.833 --> 28:30.250
just know the very last thing he wants
is for the war to end.

28:30.333 --> 28:35.333
I don't have time for cultural revolution.
It distracts from actual revolution.

28:35.416 --> 28:37.250
All right, all right, all right.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.250
[Abbie] But you got time for a haircut.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.250
Has everybody got everything
off their chest?

28:41.833 --> 28:44.416
-What in the name of hell was that?
-Evidently not.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.958
[Fred] You spoke for Bobby.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.458
I made it very clear
that I'm not his lawyer.

28:48.541 --> 28:50.833
-I'd like to sit in on these meetings.
-[Bill] You can't.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.625
-I think I will anyway.
-Fred--

28:52.708 --> 28:54.958
Bobby's life is at stake.
You're playing to the crowd.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.750
-Thank you.
-Shut up.

28:56.833 --> 29:00.541
White guys sitting in a furnished room
eating sandwiches while Bobby's in a cell.

29:00.625 --> 29:02.791
White guys are free on bail.
Bobby's locked up

29:02.875 --> 29:05.666
because he's under arrest
in Connecticut for killing a cop.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.625
It's not like he refused
to give up his seat on a bus.

29:08.708 --> 29:12.458
Convince him to let Bill and me
represent him, just for today, at least.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.000
-The judge is--
-Fucking nuts.

29:14.083 --> 29:17.291
A little hostile.
I'm sure Garry didn't anticipate that.

29:19.375 --> 29:20.583
He's innocent in Connecticut.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.541
-All right.
-He's never killed anyone.

29:22.625 --> 29:25.000
-It's important that you all know that.
-Okay.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.166
All right, you gotta try to convince him.

29:30.041 --> 29:30.875
I can't.

29:31.416 --> 29:33.583
-[Bill] Well, try.
-I have!

29:34.250 --> 29:35.708
Well, keep trying, all right?

29:37.125 --> 29:38.166
We're back.

29:38.833 --> 29:39.666
Let's go.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.666
Jerry, Abbie,
unless you're asked a direct question,

29:43.750 --> 29:46.208
I want you
to keep your mouths shut in that room.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.291
-[Abbie] This is a political trial.
-What?

29:48.375 --> 29:51.875
This is a political trial
that was already decided for us.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.083
Ignoring that reality is just weird to me.

29:55.166 --> 29:58.375
There are civil trials
and there are criminal trials.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.666
There's no such thing
as a political trial.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.833
Okay.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.291
Abbie's smarter than you think he is.

30:22.291 --> 30:24.333
Cows are smarter than I think he is.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.041
-S-T-A-H-L.
-[Schultz] What is your occupation?

30:29.125 --> 30:30.875
I am the mayor's administrative officer.

30:30.958 --> 30:36.791
Calling your attention to March 26, 1968.
Did you have a meeting on that day?

30:36.875 --> 30:38.500
-Yes.
-Uh, with whom?

30:38.583 --> 30:41.875
-Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin, is it?
-Abbie and Jerry is fine.

30:41.958 --> 30:43.375
What was said at that meeting?

30:43.458 --> 30:47.333
I was told the Youth International Party
would be holding a festival of life

30:47.416 --> 30:49.750
during the Democratic National Convention.

30:49.833 --> 30:52.166
There would be thousands
of young people attending

30:52.250 --> 30:54.291
and there'd be rock bands
playing in the park.

30:54.375 --> 30:55.666
Music will be performed.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.666
-Rock music?
-I would think.

30:57.750 --> 31:00.333
They also said
there would be public fornication.

31:00.416 --> 31:01.583
Say that again, sir?

31:01.666 --> 31:03.125
Public fornication.

31:03.208 --> 31:05.708
You're asking
for a Parks permit for public--

31:05.791 --> 31:07.041
-Yeah.
-And rock music.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.041
No, of course not.

31:08.125 --> 31:09.250
What if it was R&amp;B?

31:09.333 --> 31:12.125
-Did you issue the permits?
-No, I did not.

31:12.708 --> 31:17.583
And what, if anything, did Abbie Hoffman
say when you denied their request?

31:17.666 --> 31:19.958
Mr. Stahl, you need
to understand something.

31:20.041 --> 31:24.625
There's gonna be a festival of life
in Grant Park held during the convention.

31:24.708 --> 31:28.458
Bands will play rock music.
There will be public fornication.

31:28.541 --> 31:31.291
Likely some of it with the wives
and mistresses of delegates.

31:31.375 --> 31:35.166
Psychedelic, long-haired leftists
will consort with dope users.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.375
And we'll insist that
the next president of the US

31:38.458 --> 31:40.625
stops sending our friends
to be slaughtered.

31:40.708 --> 31:43.125
This will happen
whether you give us the permit or not.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.791
Hotels will be filled with delegates.
Where will people sleep?

31:45.875 --> 31:48.541
Some will sleep in tents,
others will live frivolously.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.583
-How many people are coming?
-A lot.

31:50.666 --> 31:53.958
What's a lot? A thousand? Two thousand?

31:54.041 --> 31:55.041
Ten thousand.

31:55.125 --> 31:57.250
-Jesus Christ.
-Right?

31:58.041 --> 32:01.166
Did Abbie Hoffman add anything
at the end of the meeting?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.208
Yes.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.083
-[Schultz] What did he say?
-He said…

32:04.166 --> 32:07.000
Or you give me 100 grand
and I could call the whole thing off.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.125
Thank you.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.125
Mr. Fineglass.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.000
Uh, Weinglass, sir.

32:14.416 --> 32:18.500
Mr. Stahl, the meeting you just described
with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin,

32:18.583 --> 32:21.750
was that the only meeting you had
with any of the defendants?

32:21.833 --> 32:22.791
No.

32:22.875 --> 32:26.541
On August 2nd, you had a meeting
with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.

32:26.625 --> 32:29.125
-Tom Hayden.
-Rennie Davis.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.958
On August 12th,
you had a meeting with David Dellinger.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.416
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the others.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.041
There were two more meetings
with Tom and Rennie

32:37.125 --> 32:39.333
on the 10th and 12th of August,

32:39.416 --> 32:43.041
and one more meeting
with David Dellinger on the 26th.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.291
I can't be sure of the dates.

32:44.375 --> 32:47.625
Well, I can be sure.
They're recorded in the log at City Hall.

32:47.708 --> 32:48.666
Okay…

32:48.750 --> 32:52.833
And in each of the meetings,
a request was made for a permit

32:52.916 --> 32:55.708
to demonstrate in Grant Park
during the convention.

32:55.791 --> 32:58.958
Mr. Stahl,
we intend a peaceful demonstration.

32:59.041 --> 33:02.041
We're not interested in violence
or disturbing the delegates.

33:02.125 --> 33:05.958
And in each of the meetings,
the request for permits was denied.

33:06.041 --> 33:08.916
Listen, I'll tell you the same thing
I told Mr. Hoffman

33:09.000 --> 33:10.791
and Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dellinger.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.083
No demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

33:13.166 --> 33:16.041
We have to demonstrate there.
That's where the convention is.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.750
There will be no demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

33:18.833 --> 33:21.083
Okay. But the thing is, there will be.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.291
-Are you threatening me, Mr. Hayden?
-No.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.833
We're not threatening you.
We're cautioning you.

33:26.916 --> 33:28.750
Thousands of people are coming to Chicago.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.833
If they're not given
a place to demonstrate,

33:30.916 --> 33:32.833
they'll demonstrate wherever they stand.

33:32.916 --> 33:35.041
So it's reckless, irresponsible,

33:35.125 --> 33:38.166
and foolishly dangerous of the city
not to have a contingency plan.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.666
We're gonna need
police security, first aid…

33:40.750 --> 33:42.458
-Traffic control.
-Water, sanitation.

33:42.541 --> 33:47.125
So, five times,
you were asked for a permit.

33:47.208 --> 33:50.125
Five times,
you were advised of the dangers

33:50.208 --> 33:52.666
of not providing
a location to demonstrate--

33:52.750 --> 33:55.041
I don't take my instructions
from the defendants.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.458
-No, you don't.
-[Stahl] I don't.

33:56.541 --> 33:58.083
You take them from Mayor Daley.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.125
You're appointed by the mayor
and you serve at his pleasure?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.041
Yes.

34:03.125 --> 34:06.250
And you're subject to removal
in the same manner by the mayor?

34:06.833 --> 34:08.833
-Yes.
-Thank you.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.791
Further cross-examination, Mr. Kunstler.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.416
Yes, sir. Mr. Stahl. When Abbie--

34:14.500 --> 34:15.666
Excuse me.

34:15.750 --> 34:20.375
Mr. Seale, would you identify
the man sitting behind you?

34:21.375 --> 34:22.875
-No, sir.
-No?

34:22.958 --> 34:24.125
-That's right.
-Why not?

34:24.208 --> 34:25.875
He's not on trial here.

34:25.958 --> 34:31.125
-Mr. Seale, identify the man behind you.
-[whispering indistinctly]

34:35.208 --> 34:36.291
His name is Fred Hampton.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.875
[Hoffman] Let the record indicate

34:37.958 --> 34:42.041
that Mr. Hampton is head of the Chicago
chapter of the Black Panther Party.

34:42.125 --> 34:46.291
Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn't at the bar.
Why is the record identifying him at all?

34:46.375 --> 34:49.625
Mr. Hampton is clearly
giving Mr. Seale legal advice.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.958
My lawyer is Charles Garry.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.583
Excuse me, sir, but for all you know,

34:53.666 --> 34:56.625
Mr. Hampton is giving Mr. Seale
the score of the White Sox game.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.000
-I will assume that he is not.
-Why?

34:59.083 --> 35:02.958
Because that's what happens
when you don't have a lawyer.

35:03.041 --> 35:06.416
The court assumes
that you are being represented

35:06.500 --> 35:09.500
by the Black Panther sitting behind you.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.208
[spectators murmuring]

35:12.791 --> 35:13.666
Continue.

35:14.416 --> 35:19.333
Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered
to call the whole thing off for $100,000,

35:19.416 --> 35:23.708
did you think that he was serious
or did you think he was making a joke?

35:23.791 --> 35:26.625
I had no reason
not to think he was serious.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.333
-Really? Do you know what extortion is?
-Yes.

35:29.416 --> 35:31.000
-Do you know it's a felony?
-Yes.

35:31.083 --> 35:33.125
Okay. So, when you called the FBI

35:33.208 --> 35:36.916
and told 'em about Mr. Hoffman's attempt
to extort a government employee,

35:37.000 --> 35:38.958
-what'd they say?
-I didn't call the FBI.

35:39.041 --> 35:42.125
Sorry. When you called the US attorney
and reported attempted extortion,

35:42.208 --> 35:44.541
-what'd their office say?
-I didn't call the US att--

35:44.625 --> 35:47.041
-Cooke County DA. Did you call them?
-No, sir.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.000
-The chief of police?
-Mr. Kunstler--

35:49.083 --> 35:51.625
The police officer posted
outside the mayor's office?

35:51.708 --> 35:55.083
How about the mayor?
Mr. Stahl, I'm gonna ask you again.

35:55.666 --> 36:01.458
When Abbie Hoffman asked
for $100,000 to call the whole thing off,

36:01.541 --> 36:06.000
did you think that he was serious
or did you know that he was making a joke?

36:06.083 --> 36:08.958
I had no reason
not to believe he was serious.

36:09.041 --> 36:12.333
Then, along with extortion,
did you know that perjury is a crime?

36:12.416 --> 36:14.708
-Objection.
-Sustained, and strike it.

36:14.791 --> 36:15.708
In fact,

36:15.791 --> 36:19.875
strike the entirety of Mr. Stahl's
testimony under cross-examination,

36:19.958 --> 36:22.750
and the jury is instructed
to disregard it.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.791
You're gonna strike
the entire cross-examination?

36:25.875 --> 36:28.666
I gave you
and co-counsel Fineglass ample--

36:28.750 --> 36:30.666
Co-counsel's name is Weinglass.

36:30.750 --> 36:34.125
Mr. Stahl's testimony
under cross-examination is entirely--

36:34.208 --> 36:36.833
You are interrupting
the court again, Mr. Kunstler.

36:36.916 --> 36:38.750
Move to reinstate testimony.

36:38.833 --> 36:40.041
[defendants] Overruled.

36:40.125 --> 36:41.708
[spectators murmuring]

36:45.208 --> 36:47.166
-Overruled.
-Exception.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.916
Noted. Are there any further questions?

36:50.541 --> 36:53.708
Yes. So, Mr. Stahl,
in any of these meetings,

36:53.791 --> 36:57.375
did any of the defendants say
that if you didn't grant them permits,

36:57.458 --> 36:59.958
that they would do
violent acts to the city?

37:00.041 --> 37:05.500
Yes, they said the Parks permit should be
issued in order to minimize destruction.

37:05.583 --> 37:08.333
Did they indicate from whom
this destruction would come?

37:09.041 --> 37:12.041
The destruction did not come
from the Chicago Police Department,

37:12.125 --> 37:13.875
if that's what you're suggesting.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.416
No further questions.

37:17.666 --> 37:19.750
I'd like to cross-examine
the witness, Your Honor.

37:19.833 --> 37:21.583
-[Hoffman] You may not.
-Have you met me?

37:21.666 --> 37:22.833
Sit, Mr. Seale.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.500
Are you guilty of conspiracy?

37:30.583 --> 37:32.625
We believe that we are innocent.

37:32.708 --> 37:36.416
The people who are guilty of conspiracy
are the fuckers who put us on trial.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.041
They are responsible for the bloodshed
that flowed in the streets of Chicago.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.541
Why won't Bobby Seale
let anyone represent him?

37:42.625 --> 37:45.000
You've posed that question
in the form of a lie.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.500
[reporters clamor]

37:50.583 --> 37:53.416
[telephone ringing]

37:53.500 --> 37:55.416
[woman]
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

37:55.500 --> 37:57.833
[telephones continue ringing]

37:57.916 --> 37:59.958
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

38:05.791 --> 38:07.750
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

38:07.833 --> 38:11.333
Maybe you don't want to call it
the, uh, Conspiracy Office.

38:11.416 --> 38:13.416
They understand irony
and appreciate the humor.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.083
-I wouldn't count on it.
-Most people are smart, Bill.

38:16.166 --> 38:19.583
If you believe that, you'll get your
heart broken every day of your life.

38:19.666 --> 38:23.083
-[telephone rings]
-Hang on. Hi, how can I help you?

38:23.166 --> 38:24.000
Messages?

38:24.083 --> 38:27.333
We sure do take contributions.
We've got high-priced lawyers.

38:27.416 --> 38:29.125
High-priced lawyers are working for free.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.208
-It's the support staff.
-We can't take grass.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.458
-[Abbie] Hey!
-Yeah.

38:32.541 --> 38:34.708
-Abbie says we'll take the weed.
-[Bill] Messages?

38:34.791 --> 38:37.083
Let me give you our mailing address.

38:37.166 --> 38:38.958
We are in Hyde Park,

38:39.041 --> 38:43.708
28 East Jackson Street,
Chicago, Illinois. 60604…

38:45.375 --> 38:48.166
I don't want you guys
holding any more press conferences.

38:48.250 --> 38:51.958
If you're gonna get between Abbie
and a camera, I'd wear pads and a helmet.

38:52.041 --> 38:54.541
We had a good day, Len.
Tell him we had a good day.

38:54.625 --> 38:55.458
Six and eleven.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.750
[Tom] What does that mean?

38:56.833 --> 39:00.083
-Jurors six and eleven. They're with us.
-How do you know?

39:00.166 --> 39:03.833
Six made sure I saw a copy
of a James Baldwin novel under her arm,

39:03.916 --> 39:06.375
and eleven's been nodding
during the Stahl cross.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.708
Falling asleep?

39:07.791 --> 39:09.583
Nodding. Agreeing.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.791
No more press conferences.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.791
[press conference playing on TV]

39:13.875 --> 39:16.083
[Jerry] You posed that question
in the form of a lie.

39:16.166 --> 39:19.541
Bobby Seale's lawyer is Charles Garry.
He's in the hospital right now.

39:19.625 --> 39:22.291
A motion was made for postponement
and it was denied.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.750
[reporter] Would you have taken
$100,000 to call it off?

39:24.833 --> 39:27.916
Yeah, sure. I would have taken $100,000.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.541
As for calling it off…

39:29.625 --> 39:31.875
[reporter] How much is it worth to you?
What's your price?

39:31.958 --> 39:33.375
[Abbie] To call off the revolution?

39:35.333 --> 39:36.666
[reporter] What's your price?

39:38.583 --> 39:39.583
My life.

40:15.250 --> 40:16.958
[softly] Any idea what's going on?

40:18.458 --> 40:21.333
It's been years since I've had
any idea what was going on.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.833
I'm going to adjourn the court for the day

40:32.916 --> 40:35.583
and see counsel
in my chambers in 15 minutes.

40:35.666 --> 40:36.916
[bailiff] All rise.

40:42.416 --> 40:44.708
Gentlemen, it's been
brought to my attention

40:44.791 --> 40:46.833
that two jurors received threatening notes

40:46.916 --> 40:49.875
from a member or members
of the Black Panther Party.

40:49.958 --> 40:50.916
Which two jurors?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.416
Juror number six and juror number eleven.

40:54.708 --> 40:57.750
These were slipped into the mail
at the homes of their parents.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.541
Bring in juror six.

41:02.791 --> 41:03.791
Six and eleven?

41:05.291 --> 41:07.333
-Yes.
-Judge, I wonder if we could draw--

41:07.416 --> 41:08.916
Juror number six, how are you?

41:09.708 --> 41:10.708
I'm fine.

41:10.791 --> 41:12.375
-[Bill] Before we talk--
-Please.

41:12.458 --> 41:15.208
Your parents received this note
this morning in their mail.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.708
They called the police,
as they should have done.

41:17.791 --> 41:20.291
I'd like you to take the note
and read it out loud.

41:21.000 --> 41:21.833
My parents?

41:21.916 --> 41:24.208
-[Bill] Your Honor, before she--
-Please read the note.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.416
"We're watching you."

41:29.166 --> 41:31.041
[Hoffman] And you see who signed it?

41:32.208 --> 41:34.291
[sighs] "The Panthers."

41:34.375 --> 41:37.125
You understand that to mean
the Black Panthers, don't you?

41:38.083 --> 41:41.250
You understand defendant Bobby Seale
is the head of the Black Panthers.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.250
-Judge, you can't--
-He's chairman of the Black Panther Party.

41:44.333 --> 41:48.500
Do you still feel that you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

41:50.625 --> 41:51.458
[sighs]

41:57.333 --> 42:00.583
[Hoffman] Juror number six,
your family has been threatened

42:00.666 --> 42:02.083
and so have you…

42:03.000 --> 42:06.833
by members of an organization
that is led by one of the defendants.

42:07.416 --> 42:09.750
Judge, for the love of Christ, she…

42:12.458 --> 42:15.041
-I apologize, Your Honor.
-I would think so.

42:15.666 --> 42:19.083
Do you still feel you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

42:22.500 --> 42:23.541
No, sir.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.208
You're dismissed from this jury.
Thank you for your service.

42:28.166 --> 42:29.750
Please bring in juror number eleven.

42:29.833 --> 42:32.208
-I'm sorry.
-Keep reading James Baldwin.

42:40.083 --> 42:43.000
[Foran] Bill, I thought the Panthers
were smarter than that.

42:43.083 --> 42:44.250
-They are.
-Well--

42:44.333 --> 42:47.208
The Panthers don't write letters
any more than the Mob does.

42:47.291 --> 42:49.958
The moment I find out
that it was your office that did,

42:50.041 --> 42:53.625
you'll see the criminal justice system
up closer than you ever wanted to.

43:07.125 --> 43:09.958
-Who are the alternates?
-[Jerry] We're gonna make this public.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.541
-Help yourself.
-[Tom] Who are they?

43:11.625 --> 43:14.458
Somebody other than the FBI
has to investigate that letter.

43:14.541 --> 43:16.666
Who'd you have in mind?
Jefferson Airplane?

43:17.250 --> 43:19.250
-The FBI investigates.
-This is bullshit.

43:19.333 --> 43:20.541
Who are the alternates?

43:20.625 --> 43:22.291
-Fucking bullshit.
-Clean up the language.

43:22.375 --> 43:25.166
Kay Richards.
42-year-old dental hygienist.

43:25.250 --> 43:26.458
[Tom] That doesn't sound bad.

43:26.541 --> 43:30.583
We think she's dating a guy named
Tom Banachek, who works for Daley.

43:30.666 --> 43:33.125
[overlapping angry chatter]

43:33.208 --> 43:35.958
-We were out of peremptory challenges.
-How did this happen?

43:36.041 --> 43:38.916
It's either her or that Korean War vet

43:39.000 --> 43:41.666
who kicked his son out of the house
for protesting the Vietnam.

43:41.750 --> 43:43.625
You don't have to be Clarence Darrow…

43:43.708 --> 43:47.666
Did they manipulate the jury pool?
How come there's nobody who looks like me?

43:47.750 --> 43:52.083
All right, raise your hands if any of you
have ever shown up for jury duty.

43:52.666 --> 43:54.875
No? Then shut the fuck up.

43:54.958 --> 43:56.333
-Bill…
-Yeah?

43:56.416 --> 43:57.375
[Tom] What?

43:58.666 --> 43:59.916
He's sequestering the jury.

44:00.541 --> 44:01.708
Of course he is.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.250
[trash can clattering]

44:04.791 --> 44:07.208
No such thing as a political trial.

44:07.291 --> 44:08.291
Good to know.

44:10.625 --> 44:11.708
I…

44:11.791 --> 44:16.833
I want an expert in geriatric psychiatry
sitting in the gallery for a few days.

44:17.750 --> 44:21.625
I want a medical evaluation
of this… this judge.

44:24.625 --> 44:28.083
[newscaster speaking on TV]

44:28.166 --> 44:32.291
The sequester's probably a reaction
to Abbie doing stand-up on weekends.

44:32.375 --> 44:33.583
It's not stand-up.

44:33.666 --> 44:36.791
You're in a college auditorium
in a spotlight telling jokes.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.500
That's a little reductive.

44:39.708 --> 44:40.833
Names?

44:40.916 --> 44:43.083
Yeah. From yesterday.

44:47.916 --> 44:48.958
[John] You hungry?

44:51.125 --> 44:53.291
If I hadn't asked you
to help me with Sara Beth,

44:53.375 --> 44:55.000
-none of this would have happened.
-No.

44:55.083 --> 44:58.125
I asked you to help with Sara Beth.
That got us the first riot.

44:58.208 --> 44:59.708
The first riot got us the real riot.

44:59.791 --> 45:01.125
-That's not--
-Hang on.

45:02.916 --> 45:07.125
[bugle playing "Taps" on TV]

45:19.750 --> 45:21.833
Anyway, I'm telling stories. I always…

45:21.916 --> 45:23.000
I'll add the names.

45:23.833 --> 45:24.666
Thank you.

45:25.333 --> 45:28.708
We move to strike the order
for sequestration of the jury,

45:28.791 --> 45:31.041
which was made by Your Honor,
sua sponte motion--

45:31.125 --> 45:32.291
Hold on.

45:34.125 --> 45:36.291
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman.

45:36.875 --> 45:38.750
-[spectators laugh]
-What are you wearing?

45:39.333 --> 45:41.875
It's an homage to you, Your Honor.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.583
Do you have clothes underneath there?

45:44.166 --> 45:46.291
Yes. Hold on.

45:47.541 --> 45:49.750
-Yes.
-Take off the robes, please.

45:53.166 --> 45:55.208
-[all laughing]
-[gavel banging]

45:55.291 --> 45:56.375
[Hoffman] Silence!

45:56.458 --> 46:00.958
Bailiff, charge Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman
with one count of contempt.

46:01.041 --> 46:02.791
Mr. Kunstler, continue.

46:04.041 --> 46:05.750
We feel that sequestration,

46:05.833 --> 46:09.250
for what appears will be
a considerable period of time, can only--

46:09.333 --> 46:13.458
It would be a considerably shorter period
if the defense made fewer objections.

46:14.041 --> 46:16.291
…can only serve
to the defendants' disadvantage.

46:16.375 --> 46:20.333
The defense will make not one
fewer objection than the prosecution

46:20.416 --> 46:22.750
or this court gives us reason to.

46:22.833 --> 46:28.041
Bailiff, charge Mr. Kunstler
with one count of contempt.

46:29.625 --> 46:32.083
May I continue my argument
so it appears in the record?

46:32.166 --> 46:33.375
You may continue.

46:33.458 --> 46:37.083
The jury will be in the custody
of the deputy marshals.

46:37.166 --> 46:40.458
The marshals will take care of
all the needs and wants of the jury.

46:40.541 --> 46:44.083
We feel that that tends
to make the jurors sympathetic.

46:44.166 --> 46:47.125
The jury are gonna be
taken care of… [fades out]

46:54.333 --> 46:56.916
[people shouting faintly]

47:01.000 --> 47:03.291
-Paul Deluca.
-And what is your occupation?

47:03.375 --> 47:06.333
[Deluca] I'm a detective with
the police department, City of Chicago.

47:06.416 --> 47:10.000
Calling your attention to
August of 1968 during the convention,

47:10.083 --> 47:12.166
did you have a specific assignment?

47:12.250 --> 47:16.708
To keep Rennie Davis under surveillance
with my partner, Detective Bell.

47:16.791 --> 47:21.708
While you were surveilling Rennie Davis
on the evening of Sunday, August 25th,

47:21.791 --> 47:23.750
the night before the convention began,

47:23.833 --> 47:26.541
did you observe
Tom Hayden committing a crime?

47:26.625 --> 47:30.916
Yes, Mr. Hayden was letting the air out
of the tire of a police vehicle.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.291
-[music playing]
-[siren wails]

47:32.375 --> 47:36.750
[officer on loudspeaker] The park closes
at 11:00 p.m. by order of the Chicago PD.

47:36.833 --> 47:38.750
You must be out of the park by 11:00 p.m.

47:39.625 --> 47:42.500
Violators will be prosecuted
for trespassing.

47:43.416 --> 47:45.833
I repeat, you must be out of the park.

47:45.916 --> 47:48.083

47:48.166 --> 47:53.541
♪ Say you will
You will be mine… ♪

48:00.208 --> 48:03.375
It's a strategy of throwin' banana peels
all over Chicago,

48:03.916 --> 48:05.375
and the machine will stumble.

48:05.458 --> 48:08.583
When it stumbles,
it goes into a policy of overkill

48:08.666 --> 48:10.791
and it starts to devour itself.

48:11.708 --> 48:13.041
We gotta convince 'em.

48:13.125 --> 48:17.291
We gotta convince 'em of what?
That we're crazy enough to do anything.

48:30.833 --> 48:31.916
[man] You know it!

48:32.000 --> 48:34.458
[Jerry] Right, confrontational tactics
make us safer.

48:34.541 --> 48:35.375
-Yeah.
-Right.

48:35.458 --> 48:37.583
[Jerry] Why?
Because the pigs become afraid.

48:38.375 --> 48:41.375
You know,
and that's fighting fire with what?

48:41.458 --> 48:42.500
[all] Fire!

48:42.583 --> 48:45.708
You don't fight fire with fire.
You fight it with water, jackass.

48:45.791 --> 48:48.541
-It's a metaphor.
-Abbie and his fuckin' banana peels?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.625
Also a metaphor.

48:49.708 --> 48:52.000
Between the cops,
the state police and the Guard,

48:52.083 --> 48:56.125
Daley's got 15,000 soldiers whose guns
are loaded with bullets that are literal.

48:56.208 --> 48:59.791
-I could argue that the bullets are also--
-Yeah, so could I, but don't.

49:00.416 --> 49:03.583
The atmosphere's getting dangerous
and someone's gonna throw a rock.

49:03.666 --> 49:06.458
I wanna get the word out
we're protesting the war and not the cops.

49:06.541 --> 49:08.250
-Damn it!
-What?

49:09.041 --> 49:10.208
I think those are my guys.

49:11.125 --> 49:12.458
I think that's their car.

49:14.041 --> 49:17.666
Yep, that's them. They're back.
They were following me all day.

49:18.625 --> 49:21.750
Listen, here's the thing
I haven't told you about Sara Beth.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.916
-She isn't into this at all.
-Isn't into what?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.666
When I'm with her
and her family, I try to…

49:27.250 --> 49:29.625
I de-emphasize the…

49:30.583 --> 49:32.958
-radical revolutionary part of my--
-Got it.

49:33.041 --> 49:34.875
Her parents are letting me stay with them.

49:34.958 --> 49:37.666
If I show up tailed
by two undercover police officers--

49:37.750 --> 49:40.333
-That'll be hard to explain.
-This isn't her world.

49:40.416 --> 49:42.833
It's definitely not her parents' world.

49:42.916 --> 49:47.041
-If I bring my world into their driveway--
-You could be in a healthier relationship.

49:47.125 --> 49:50.833
I know, but until then,
it's the one I got.

49:51.416 --> 49:53.416
-So that's their car?
-[Rennie] Yep.

49:55.125 --> 49:57.291
-[Tom] Where are they?
-Looking for me.

49:58.208 --> 50:01.000
All right, go back into the crowd
and let 'em find you.

50:01.625 --> 50:04.083
And then leave the park by the east exit.

50:04.166 --> 50:06.958
-They'll need their car to follow you.
-What are you gonna do?

50:07.041 --> 50:10.541
It won't remind anyone of Gandhi,
but a little civil disobedience. Go.

50:10.625 --> 50:14.000
-You're not gonna cut the brakes--
-I'll let the air out of a tire. Go.

50:14.083 --> 50:17.375
[sighs] I appreciate it.
I don't wanna be a phony with Sara--

50:17.458 --> 50:20.333
-You're welcome. You should really go now.
-Yep.

50:22.208 --> 50:26.083
Detective Bell and I spotted
Rennie Davis walking in the crowd,

50:26.166 --> 50:28.666
and we observed him on foot
for a few minutes.

50:28.750 --> 50:30.083
Then we returned to the unit.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.916
-Your car?
-Yes.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.083
What did you find?

50:33.166 --> 50:35.958
[air hissing]

50:36.041 --> 50:38.458
-[Deluca] Don't fuckin' move.
-[Bell] On your feet.

50:38.541 --> 50:40.708
Those are two contradictory instructions--

50:42.291 --> 50:44.041
All right, hands behind your head.

50:44.583 --> 50:45.833
Spread your legs.

50:46.458 --> 50:49.708
-Was that a contradictory instruction?
-No.

50:49.791 --> 50:52.208
-What happened then?
-Someone from the crowd shouted…

50:52.291 --> 50:55.958
-[woman] They're hassling Tom Hayden!
-Paulie, you need to see what I'm seeing.

50:58.166 --> 51:02.208
-[Deluca] Hey! Stay back there! All of ya!
-[Bell] Police! Stay back!

51:02.291 --> 51:06.000
-Listen, everybody stay cool.
-Shut up. All right, tell 'em to get back.

51:06.083 --> 51:08.541
-Again, that's a contradict--
-Tell 'em to get back.

51:08.625 --> 51:10.791
Did he tell the crowd to back down?

51:10.875 --> 51:13.666
Everybody get back.
I'm all right. Stay cool.

51:13.750 --> 51:15.083
He was egging them on.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.541
Did you take Mr. Hayden under arrest
at that moment?

51:17.625 --> 51:19.291
-No, sir.
-Why not?

51:19.875 --> 51:23.000
-Who's shinin' that?
-Paulie, it's a camera. It's a TV camera.

51:23.875 --> 51:25.916
We wanted to defuse the situation,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.250
so we arranged
to take Mr. Hayden in the next morning.

51:32.250 --> 51:33.458
This is gonna be for me.

51:33.541 --> 51:35.166
Let me try to explain to them.

51:35.250 --> 51:37.208
Tell 'em about Sara Beth's parents.

51:37.291 --> 51:38.750
-Yeah.
-I was kidding.

51:38.833 --> 51:41.208
Just bail me out
and keep to the schedule. It's fine.

51:41.291 --> 51:42.958
-Tom Hayden?
-Yeah.

51:43.041 --> 51:44.791
-See you in a bit.
-You're under arrest.

51:44.875 --> 51:45.708
Got it.

51:47.166 --> 51:50.333
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume at 1:30--

51:50.416 --> 51:53.166
Your Honor, I have a motion
I'd like to bring forward.

51:53.250 --> 51:56.208
You wish to address the court, Mr. Seale?

51:56.291 --> 51:59.833
-Yes. I have a motion--
-I will hear you, Mr. Seale.

52:01.875 --> 52:02.708
Just a moment.

52:03.250 --> 52:05.500
Mr. Seale, do you have a motion?

52:05.583 --> 52:09.333
"I, Bobby G. Seale, have a motion
pro se to defend myself."

52:09.416 --> 52:12.833
"I'd like to invoke the precedent
of Adams v. US ex rel. McCann,

52:12.916 --> 52:14.500
where the Supreme Court is--"

52:14.583 --> 52:17.458
That's enough.
Where are you learning these things?

52:17.541 --> 52:20.958
Does your young friend Mr. Hampton
have a background in law?

52:21.041 --> 52:24.541
Your Honor, the other defendants
would like to join in Mr. Seale's motion.

52:24.625 --> 52:26.708
Are you now speaking
on behalf of Mr. Seale?

52:26.791 --> 52:30.583
No, Your Honor, I'm speaking
on behalf of the other defendants.

52:30.666 --> 52:33.416
You're right next to him.
Why don't you represent him?

52:33.500 --> 52:36.083
Because I'm not his lawyer, sir.

52:36.166 --> 52:39.583
And if I understand Mr. Seale,
this last month and a half,

52:39.666 --> 52:43.833
and I believe I have,
he is not represented by counsel.

52:43.916 --> 52:44.750
Overruled.

52:44.833 --> 52:46.791
-I am being denied right now…
-Mr. Seale…

52:46.875 --> 52:50.625
…my constitutional right
for legal representation--

52:50.708 --> 52:52.125
Will you be quiet!

52:53.750 --> 52:56.208
You have lawyers to speak for you.

52:56.291 --> 52:58.083
[shouting] No, he doesn't!

53:13.458 --> 53:17.625
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his second count of contempt.

53:17.708 --> 53:18.875
[bailiff] All rise.

53:24.416 --> 53:26.041
[crowd laughing]

53:26.125 --> 53:30.041
[Abbie] So, Hayden's in a holding cell
on a tire pressure-related charge,

53:30.125 --> 53:33.208
and suddenly, every freak
in Chicago is mobilized.

53:33.291 --> 53:35.083
"They got Hayden!"

53:35.166 --> 53:38.083
"We gotta march down
to the police station,

53:38.166 --> 53:41.125
overcome the cops
and the Illinois National Guard

53:41.208 --> 53:43.000
and free Tom Hayden!"

53:43.083 --> 53:44.250
[crowd laughing]

53:44.333 --> 53:46.041
We couldn't find our way out of the park.

53:46.125 --> 53:48.208
[crowd laughing]

53:48.291 --> 53:53.333
Now, over the course of ten days,
the government called 37 witnesses,

53:53.416 --> 53:57.125
each and every one of them
an employee of the government.

53:57.750 --> 54:01.375
I call this portion of the trial
"with friends like these."

54:01.458 --> 54:03.541
Rennie, this is Sam. He can be trusted.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.708
Detective Sam McGiven,
Chicago Police Department.

54:06.791 --> 54:08.416
-Abbie, this is Stan.
-Oh, hey.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.416
-Stan Wojohowski.
-How you doin', Stan?

54:10.500 --> 54:13.708
-What is your occupation?
-I'm a Chicago police officer.

54:13.791 --> 54:15.000
Scotty Scibelli, Tom.

54:15.083 --> 54:18.041
I'm your guy for ass, weed
or whatever you need.

54:18.125 --> 54:21.125
Staff Sergeant Scott Scibelli,
Illinois State Police.

54:22.583 --> 54:25.958
-[billiard balls clacking]
-[jazz music playing]

54:27.166 --> 54:29.083
It's from the woman in the glasses.

54:32.333 --> 54:33.875
-Really?
-Yeah.

54:43.916 --> 54:46.208
Hey, uh, did you mean this for me?

54:46.291 --> 54:48.625
-I did.
-Nobody's ever sent me a drink before.

54:48.708 --> 54:51.250
-How do you like it so far?
-It's a Tom Collins.

54:51.333 --> 54:54.208
I know it's a country club drink,
but they're delicious.

54:54.291 --> 54:59.000
A man in England named Tom Collins
claimed in 1894 to have invented it,

54:59.083 --> 55:01.916
but then another man,
whose name I've forgotten, said no,

55:02.000 --> 55:05.708
he'd invented it two years earlier,
and I think there was a lawsuit.

55:05.791 --> 55:08.750
That's a surprising amount of controversy
for gin and lemonade.

55:09.333 --> 55:10.583
-I'm Jerry.
-I know.

55:11.416 --> 55:15.541
Jerry, do you know why the French
only eat one egg for breakfast?

55:15.625 --> 55:17.583
-No.
-Because in France,

55:17.666 --> 55:20.291
one egg… is un oeuf.

55:22.416 --> 55:23.666
It's un oeuf.

55:24.333 --> 55:26.958
-[chuckles] Wow!
-I know!

55:27.041 --> 55:29.458
I feel so much better
about my Tom Collins story.

55:29.541 --> 55:30.458
[chuckles]

55:31.166 --> 55:32.208
I'm Daphne O'Connor.

55:32.291 --> 55:35.958
Special Agent Daphne O'Connor,
FBI Counterintelligence.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.208
[Schultz] Spell your name.

55:37.291 --> 55:40.916
Think it's possible there were
seven demonstrators in Chicago last summer

55:41.000 --> 55:43.625
leading 10,000 undercover cops in protest?

55:43.708 --> 55:45.166
What was your assignment in Chicago?

55:45.250 --> 55:48.458
To use Jerry Rubin
to infiltrate the leaders of the protest.

55:48.541 --> 55:52.291
And you were with Jerry Rubin,
Abbie Hoffman, Dave Dellinger

55:52.375 --> 55:55.458
and Rennie Davis
on the afternoon of the 27th?

55:55.541 --> 55:56.375
Yes.

55:56.458 --> 55:59.791
-What were they doing together?
-They were leading a group of protesters.

55:59.875 --> 56:01.833
-How many, would you say?
-About 800.

56:01.916 --> 56:03.708
Where were they leading these 800 people?

56:03.791 --> 56:06.708
-To police headquarters at 11th and State.
-Why?

56:06.791 --> 56:10.708
Tom Hayden was being held there on charges
of tampering with a police vehicle.

56:10.791 --> 56:13.458
Jerry Rubin said
it was time to "confront the pigs."

56:14.125 --> 56:16.041
And by "pigs," he meant…

56:16.125 --> 56:18.333
It was time to confront the police.

56:18.416 --> 56:21.208
[indistinct radio chatter]

56:21.291 --> 56:22.958
[man] Follow Abbie!

56:23.625 --> 56:25.500
[David] Marshals, we're on the move.

56:29.333 --> 56:33.125
I remember also at the front of the group
was Mr. Allen Ginsberg.

56:33.208 --> 56:34.833
Allen Ginsberg, the poet?

56:34.916 --> 56:37.708
Yes, he was chanting a kind of war chant.

56:37.791 --> 56:41.000
-[Ginsberg chanting] Om.
-[Jerry] What's he doing?

56:41.083 --> 56:43.166
He's channeling the energy.
Settling things down.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.625
And how's that workin' so far?

56:44.708 --> 56:47.625
-[woman] Our streets!
-[all] Our streets!

56:47.708 --> 56:51.666
-[woman] Our streets!
-[all] Our streets!

56:51.750 --> 56:56.500
The guy testified that Ginsberg
was letting out a war chant,

56:56.583 --> 57:00.458
some kinda fucking jungle signal
to Beat poets,

57:00.541 --> 57:04.291
that they should begin
pelting the troops with blank verse.

57:04.375 --> 57:06.333
[crowd laughs]

57:06.416 --> 57:09.875
So, a guy in the crowd is marching
with a girl on his shoulders.

57:09.958 --> 57:12.416
She's waving an American flag,

57:12.500 --> 57:16.125
and this seems to really
be bothering some frat brothers

57:16.208 --> 57:18.916
who'd come to town
in the spirit of fraternity.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.333
-[frat boy 1] Put down the flag!
-[frat boy 2] Hey, put the flag down!

57:22.416 --> 57:25.416
Can you hear us?
Are you fucking deaf, you bitch?

57:25.500 --> 57:29.583
-Put the flag down!
-Go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich!

57:29.666 --> 57:31.875
I'm gonna go back there
and take care of that.

57:31.958 --> 57:33.250
They are not the enemy.

57:33.333 --> 57:35.083
In so many fuckin' ways, they are.

57:37.541 --> 57:42.000
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!
Free Tom Hayden!

57:45.708 --> 57:47.916
The group turned left on 11th Street.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.916
We make a left on 11th Street.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.083
That's when they saw it.

57:51.166 --> 57:55.708
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

57:55.791 --> 57:58.583
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

57:58.666 --> 58:00.958
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

58:01.041 --> 58:02.500
Holy shit! [chuckles]

58:02.583 --> 58:04.500
[protesters continue chanting]

58:04.583 --> 58:06.875
[protesters continue chanting]

58:06.958 --> 58:08.666
Are they about to conquer Spain?

58:08.750 --> 58:10.750
[chanting continues]

58:10.833 --> 58:13.625
[protesters] Free Tom Hayden!

58:13.708 --> 58:14.541
Fuck it.

58:15.375 --> 58:18.333
-What do you mean, "Fuck it"?
-This is it. It's time.

58:19.041 --> 58:21.875
-We're not rushing the police.
-Why the fuck not?

58:21.958 --> 58:25.125
-We'll be critically injured.
-Tom doesn't want anyone hurt.

58:25.208 --> 58:27.375
Turn this crowd around.
There's too much momentum.

58:27.458 --> 58:30.166
-Turn 'em around and calm them down.
-What are we doin'?

58:30.250 --> 58:33.416
He's right. This is not safe.
I know something about this. Come on.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.458
Marshals, turn 'em around
and slow 'em down.

58:35.541 --> 58:38.000
Looks like the Alamo back here.
Turn 'em around.

58:38.083 --> 58:40.875
-Bring 'em safely to the park.
-We should be marching up to them.

58:40.958 --> 58:43.000
I don't think they'll surrender, man.

58:43.583 --> 58:47.291
Keep 'em movin'. Dave and I
are gonna stay and make Tom's bail.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.583
Back to the park!

58:49.666 --> 58:51.541
I don't carry money, do you?

58:52.208 --> 58:54.500
I do. I'm a grown man.

58:54.583 --> 58:55.916
[Ginsberg chanting] Om.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.416
You're killin' me, Allen.
You're goddamn killing me!

58:58.500 --> 59:01.000
The marshals are spreading word
that we gotta keep moving.

59:01.083 --> 59:03.625
"Go left on Roosevelt
and back in the park," right?

59:03.708 --> 59:05.000
When they got to the park,

59:05.083 --> 59:08.000
three divisions of police officers
had moved in from the south.

59:08.083 --> 59:11.125
[police siren wails]

59:18.625 --> 59:21.125
[indistinct shouting]

59:27.708 --> 59:31.041
I don't know
what tactical genius came up with that,

59:31.125 --> 59:32.791
but you know when shit happens?

59:32.875 --> 59:36.000
When you don't give protesters
a place to go.

59:36.083 --> 59:38.375
How would you characterize
the mood of the crowd?

59:38.458 --> 59:42.750
The witness is in no position to
characterize the mood of 1,000 strangers.

59:42.833 --> 59:44.208
Do you have an objection?

59:44.291 --> 59:46.166
-Yes, sir.
-On what grounds?

59:46.250 --> 59:47.250
On those grounds.

59:47.833 --> 59:49.250
[spectators] Overruled.

59:49.333 --> 59:51.291
I will clear this courtroom.

59:52.666 --> 59:53.833
Mr. Wojohowski?

59:53.916 --> 59:55.333
The crowd was looking for a fight.

59:55.416 --> 59:58.500
You're pigs! Your children are pigs!

59:58.583 --> 1:00:00.791
No, we should leave
their children out of it.

1:00:00.875 --> 1:00:02.291
You're right. I know.

1:00:02.375 --> 1:00:04.916
"White honky MFers, get out of our park."

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.375
And then he said, "Look at 'em."

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:07.875
They don't look so tough.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:10.458
Well, the guns…

1:00:10.541 --> 1:00:12.791
There are no permits
for this demonstration.

1:00:12.875 --> 1:00:14.833
You're ordered
to leave the park, immediately!

1:00:14.916 --> 1:00:17.333
Put down your guns, motherfuckers!

1:00:17.416 --> 1:00:18.958
Fight like fuckin' men!

1:00:19.041 --> 1:00:21.625
Just so you know,
I do not have your back on that.

1:00:21.708 --> 1:00:26.250
And the guys from Kappa Gamma Douchebag,
who were hassling the girl?

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:28.041
-[crowd chuckles]
-They're back.

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:30.916
Put down the goddamn flag, you cunt!

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.916
-Go make me a sandwich!
-Put it down!

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.875
-Put the flag down!
-[Daphne] Calm down!

1:00:34.958 --> 1:00:37.416
-[overlapping shouts]
-Help me calm 'em down, Jerry!

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:40.250
Baby, defuse the situation.
They will listen to you.

1:00:40.333 --> 1:00:42.000
-Huh.
-What?

1:00:42.083 --> 1:00:44.333
Nothing, that sounded nice
when you said it.

1:00:44.416 --> 1:00:45.583
-Right now!
-Yeah.

1:00:45.666 --> 1:00:48.916
-Someone from the crowd shouts…
-A guy in the crowd shouts…

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.875
Someone in the crowd shouted…

1:00:50.958 --> 1:00:52.125
Take the hill!

1:00:52.208 --> 1:00:56.291
Hey! Stop running! Hey, everybody!

1:00:56.375 --> 1:00:59.625
The street name
for chloroacetophenone is tear gas.

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:00.666
Fire!

1:01:01.625 --> 1:01:04.208
[Abbie] And it's a fuckin' blowtorch.

1:01:04.291 --> 1:01:06.708
Your lungs, your skin, your eyes…

1:01:06.791 --> 1:01:08.333
-[man] Go, go!
-Riot clubs?

1:01:08.416 --> 1:01:11.208
They're made out of the same wood
they use for baseball bats.

1:01:11.291 --> 1:01:13.166
[overlapping clamor]

1:01:30.958 --> 1:01:33.208
[woman screams] Let me go!

1:01:38.916 --> 1:01:42.166
[coughing]

1:01:42.250 --> 1:01:43.666
-Put the flag down!
-[screaming]

1:01:48.333 --> 1:01:50.875
-Hey!
-[frat boy] You shut your fuckin' mouth!

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:52.625
-What are you doing?
-[woman screaming]

1:01:52.708 --> 1:01:54.250
[frat boy] You got this coming!

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:57.875
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Hey! Hey, get the fuck off of her!

1:01:57.958 --> 1:01:59.250
What's the matter with you?

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:00.541
Fuck you, hippie faggot!

1:02:00.625 --> 1:02:02.541
[grunting]

1:02:03.208 --> 1:02:04.583
You're all right.

1:02:04.666 --> 1:02:06.625
-You're okay. Here.
-[coughing]

1:02:06.708 --> 1:02:09.750
You gotta just hold this
over your face, okay?

1:02:09.833 --> 1:02:12.041
I'm gonna take you
to the first-aid station.

1:02:12.125 --> 1:02:13.583
You're all right. I got you.

1:02:13.666 --> 1:02:16.166
We have to go. Okay,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:02:16.250 --> 1:02:17.500
-[gun cocks]
-I'm gonna…

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:21.625
[officer] Don't move, Jerry.

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:24.416
-Man, get those guys. They were--
-You're under arrest.

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:29.541
[man over PA] Everybody gather
in the center of the park…

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:31.958
After bailing out Tom Hayden,

1:02:32.041 --> 1:02:36.375
Abbie, Dave and Tom returned to the park.
Is that correct?

1:02:36.458 --> 1:02:38.916
[ambulance siren wailing]

1:02:42.708 --> 1:02:44.583
[man] Sir, can you look at me? Sir?

1:02:44.666 --> 1:02:45.875
[grunts]

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:51.458
[officer] Get in.

1:02:55.750 --> 1:02:57.041
I'll be honest.

1:02:57.125 --> 1:03:00.000
I was starting to worry about
getting everyone out of Chicago alive.

1:03:00.083 --> 1:03:02.500
-That's not really up to us.
-Yeah, it is.

1:03:03.208 --> 1:03:05.708
What are you lookin' at me for?
I went to bail you out.

1:03:06.291 --> 1:03:08.458
800 people followed you?

1:03:08.541 --> 1:03:12.458
Oh, that. Yeah, people follow me.
Hell if I know why.

1:03:12.541 --> 1:03:14.250
I'm racking my brain as well.

1:03:14.333 --> 1:03:16.000
How'd you make bail so fast?

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:18.541
I wasn't arrested, I was detained.

1:03:18.625 --> 1:03:21.000
They couldn't figure out
what to charge me with.

1:03:21.083 --> 1:03:22.083
Assault.

1:03:23.625 --> 1:03:26.291
I was assaulting someone
who was assaulting someone.

1:03:26.375 --> 1:03:27.458
-So--
-[Daphne] Okay, guys.

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:30.416
Nothing is more dangerous
than a crowd of people moving.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:33.041
It's like trying to redirect
the Mississippi River.

1:03:33.958 --> 1:03:36.291
-Isn't she great?
-Get your people to cool off.

1:03:36.375 --> 1:03:38.875
-We're responsible for these people.
-Tommy.

1:03:38.958 --> 1:03:41.125
We have to protest
in front of the convention.

1:03:41.208 --> 1:03:44.458
Plain and simple.
'Cause that's where the cameras are.

1:03:44.541 --> 1:03:48.125
We have to get to the convention.
That means we have to leave the park.

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:49.958
And that's when people'll get hurt.

1:03:50.041 --> 1:03:54.041
As long as every person following me
knows that, then I sleep fine at night.

1:03:54.125 --> 1:03:55.666
Tell me how you do it.

1:03:55.750 --> 1:03:57.541
-A lot of it is drugs.
-Yeah?

1:03:58.125 --> 1:04:00.666
This is what happened
when we try to go up a hill.

1:04:01.666 --> 1:04:04.458
We're not getting
anywhere near the convention.

1:04:06.208 --> 1:04:10.875
Special Agent O'Connor,
you testified that Jerry Rubin said,

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:15.541
"Fuck 'em all. They're all pigs.
We should form an army and get guns."

1:04:16.166 --> 1:04:17.000
Yes.

1:04:17.083 --> 1:04:20.041
And when he said that,
did anyone form an army and get guns?

1:04:20.125 --> 1:04:20.958
No.

1:04:21.041 --> 1:04:24.625
[Bill] Did Jerry Rubin instruct
the crowd to run into the park?

1:04:25.208 --> 1:04:27.000
-No.
-Did Rennie Davis?

1:04:27.083 --> 1:04:29.791
-No.
-Was Abbie Hoffman even there?

1:04:29.875 --> 1:04:31.750
-No.
-Was Dave Dellinger?

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:33.833
-No.
-John Froines there?

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:35.291
-No.
-Lee Weiner?

1:04:36.166 --> 1:04:37.250
No, he wasn't there.

1:04:37.333 --> 1:04:39.875
You testified that Jerry and Rennie…

1:04:39.958 --> 1:04:41.708
Can you say it for me again?

1:04:41.791 --> 1:04:44.416
That they were trying
to turn the people around

1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:47.875
and send them back down the hill
just like you told them to.

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:50.000
Is that correct?

1:04:54.666 --> 1:04:57.500
Mr. Kunstler,
the demonstrators attacked the police

1:04:57.583 --> 1:04:58.916
and the police responded.

1:05:00.416 --> 1:05:04.500
And are any of those demonstrators
that you saw attacking the police

1:05:04.583 --> 1:05:06.875
sitting here at the defense table?

1:05:06.958 --> 1:05:09.583
-No, sir.
-Well, thank you.

1:05:10.083 --> 1:05:12.000
No further questions.

1:05:12.083 --> 1:05:14.083
-The court will stand--
-I wasn't there, either.

1:05:14.166 --> 1:05:15.958
-Mr. Seale--
-I wasn't there at all.

1:05:16.041 --> 1:05:18.333
I should be allowed
to cross-examine this witness!

1:05:18.416 --> 1:05:21.000
-We will stand in recess until--
-Four hours!

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:22.083
[Hoffman] Mr. Hampton!

1:05:22.166 --> 1:05:24.041
That's how long Bobby Seale
was in Chicago.

1:05:24.125 --> 1:05:25.708
-[Hoffman] Quiet!
-Four hours!

1:05:25.791 --> 1:05:28.916
-[spectators clapping]
-[gavel banging]

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.625
[gavel banging continues]

1:05:33.166 --> 1:05:34.375
[bailiff] All rise.

1:05:39.333 --> 1:05:42.250
[Hoffman] The court will stand in recess
for the weekend.

1:05:46.916 --> 1:05:49.291
[brass quartet playing Christmas carols]

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:51.083
[Jerry] Yeah, I took in the exhibit.

1:05:51.166 --> 1:05:53.000
I cleared my mind.

1:05:54.458 --> 1:05:57.125
Stood there for 20 minutes.
I felt nothing.

1:05:58.958 --> 1:06:03.458
Well, but it wasn't a painting,
it was an exhibit.

1:06:04.166 --> 1:06:05.625
It was a natural history museum.

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:08.625
And when you put exhibits
of Native Indian families

1:06:08.708 --> 1:06:10.250
in a natural history museum

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:13.500
alongside dioramas of early man
and the Jurassic age,

1:06:13.583 --> 1:06:18.333
it gives the impression that the Cherokee
evolved into modern-day Europeans.

1:06:19.416 --> 1:06:20.541
[Abbie] Look who it is.

1:06:21.125 --> 1:06:23.083
I got a bone to pick with that guy.

1:06:23.166 --> 1:06:24.333
Hey, Counselor.

1:06:25.708 --> 1:06:27.958
-No colleges this weekend?
-[Abbie] Winter break.

1:06:28.041 --> 1:06:30.708
-My audience went home to their parents.
-[Schultz] Mm-hmm.

1:06:30.791 --> 1:06:32.333
Are these ladies related to you?

1:06:32.416 --> 1:06:34.791
These are my daughters.
This is Emily and Julie.

1:06:34.875 --> 1:06:36.208
[Abbie] Your dad's a good guy.

1:06:36.291 --> 1:06:39.250
That's coming from someone
who he's trying hard to put in prison.

1:06:39.333 --> 1:06:41.291
We shouldn't be talking
without your lawyer.

1:06:41.375 --> 1:06:42.625
We're all on the same team.

1:06:43.250 --> 1:06:46.666
In a sense, I guess,
but in a much truer sense, we're not.

1:06:46.750 --> 1:06:49.166
Girls, here, take this dollar

1:06:49.250 --> 1:06:52.916
and go over to those musicians
and put it in their hat, okay?

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.958
And here's a quarter.
Go buy some of those candy-coated peanuts

1:06:56.041 --> 1:06:59.041
that your mom won't let you have.
All right? Shh.

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.875
-[Abbie] Sweet kids.
-Thank you.

1:07:01.958 --> 1:07:06.541
If your lawyer were here, I'd tell you
the window's closing for you to plead out.

1:07:07.125 --> 1:07:09.458
We're not taking a fuckin' deal.
Would you stop?

1:07:10.041 --> 1:07:13.000
I wish I could share Abbie's sentiment
that you're a good guy,

1:07:13.083 --> 1:07:14.250
but I'm afraid I can't.

1:07:14.833 --> 1:07:16.333
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:07:16.416 --> 1:07:20.333
Sending Daphne O'Connor
to break my heart was way out of line.

1:07:20.416 --> 1:07:22.708
Well, I don't work for the FBI,

1:07:22.791 --> 1:07:25.833
but O'Connor was one of many agents
sent to gather intelligence

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:27.875
on what had been deemed a credible threat.

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:32.000
Fine. Then you bug our phones,
you wire up a dope dealer. Be a man.

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:35.958
-You don't send a woman to ensorcell me.
-What?

1:07:36.041 --> 1:07:37.750
-It means to enchant.
-Oh.

1:07:37.833 --> 1:07:41.583
-Only to have her crush my soul.
-How long did you two know each other?

1:07:42.166 --> 1:07:45.375
Ninety-three hours.
Could've been a lifetime.

1:07:45.458 --> 1:07:47.583
For a fruit fly. Enjoy your weekend.

1:07:47.666 --> 1:07:49.375
[Jerry] Is that even ethical?

1:07:50.250 --> 1:07:51.583
Aren't there ethics rules?

1:07:51.666 --> 1:07:53.208
Did she engage with you sexually?

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.750
Well, we were takin' it slow.

1:07:57.708 --> 1:07:59.333
He's gonna be all right.

1:07:59.416 --> 1:08:00.666
One egg is un oeuf?

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:04.250
-They teach her that at the Academy?
-Yep.

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:06.166
We don't have any beef with you.

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:09.208
We know you're doing your job
and you don't think we're criminals.

1:08:09.291 --> 1:08:11.000
I'm not sure where you get that info,

1:08:11.083 --> 1:08:13.791
but I represent the People
without passion or prejudice.

1:08:14.375 --> 1:08:16.250
You think we were responsible?

1:08:16.833 --> 1:08:18.625
You got the result you were looking for.

1:08:19.541 --> 1:08:22.500
-So did Nixon.
-How 'bout that?

1:08:23.458 --> 1:08:24.541
See you Monday.

1:08:26.375 --> 1:08:27.666
Does she ever mention me?

1:08:38.291 --> 1:08:40.166
[telephone ringing]

1:08:52.041 --> 1:08:53.208
Conspiracy Office.

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:00.541
I need a second.

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:08.666
Something's happened, Tom.

1:09:09.250 --> 1:09:10.666
[door buzzes and unlocks]

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:19.500
[door slams]

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.291
[Bill] Bobby, uh…

1:09:32.875 --> 1:09:35.666
Fred Hampton
was shot and killed last night.

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:43.250
There was a police raid,
and there was a shootout.

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:45.166
And he's dead.

1:09:48.416 --> 1:09:51.083
-It took place between the hours of 4:00--
-I know.

1:09:51.958 --> 1:09:54.708
-You were told?
-Yeah.

1:09:54.791 --> 1:09:55.875
Um…

1:09:57.166 --> 1:09:58.541
I'm so sorry.

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:09.333
The seven of you,
you've all got the same father, right?

1:10:11.458 --> 1:10:12.958
I'm talkin' to you.

1:10:15.166 --> 1:10:17.416
You all got the same father, right?

1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:19.083
"Cut your hair…

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:25.333
don't be a fag, respect authority,
respect America, respect me."

1:10:27.375 --> 1:10:31.000
Your life, it's a "fuck you"
to your father, right?

1:10:33.166 --> 1:10:34.000
A little?

1:10:36.083 --> 1:10:38.375
-[softly] Maybe.
-[Bobby] Maybe.

1:10:39.041 --> 1:10:41.833
And you can see how that's different
from a rope on a tree?

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:43.750
Yeah.

1:10:44.458 --> 1:10:45.291
Yeah.

1:10:49.041 --> 1:10:50.916
He was shot in the shoulder first.

1:10:52.708 --> 1:10:55.166
You can't aim a gun
if you've been shot in the shoulder.

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:56.791
You can't squeeze the trigger.

1:10:58.041 --> 1:10:59.833
Second shot was in his head.

1:11:02.333 --> 1:11:03.958
Fred was executed.

1:11:08.666 --> 1:11:09.666
Anything else?

1:11:13.916 --> 1:11:14.750
No.

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:23.708
[door buzzes and opens]

1:11:26.708 --> 1:11:27.541
[door slams]

1:11:27.625 --> 1:11:31.375
[Schultz distorted] Calling your attention
to the evening of the next day,

1:11:31.458 --> 1:11:34.875
Tuesday, August 27th,
were you in Grant Park?

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:38.750
[detective distorted] Yes. There was
a "Free Huey Newton" rally going on.

1:11:38.833 --> 1:11:42.625
-[Schultz] Recognize any of the speakers?
-I heard Jerry Rubin give a speech.

1:11:42.708 --> 1:11:45.208
Phil Ochs sang,
and then Bobby Seale gave a speech.

1:11:45.291 --> 1:11:48.958
I object to this testimony against me
because I have been denied counsel.

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:51.000
We understand.

1:11:51.583 --> 1:11:54.250
Do you recall any of Mr. Seale's speech?

1:11:54.333 --> 1:11:55.416
[detective] Yes. He said--

1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:57.458
-I object to this man's--
-Quiet!

1:11:58.375 --> 1:11:59.208
[Schultz] Go ahead.

1:11:59.291 --> 1:12:01.833
-[detective] May I refer to notes?
-[Schultz] Yes.

1:12:02.916 --> 1:12:07.125
[clears throat] He said, "We must
understand that as we go forth

1:12:07.208 --> 1:12:09.166
to try to move
the reprobate politicians…"

1:12:09.250 --> 1:12:10.083
Your Honor--

1:12:10.166 --> 1:12:14.000
"…our cowardly Congress,
the jive, double-lip talking Nixon--"

1:12:14.083 --> 1:12:16.333
"Jive, double-lip, talking Nixon…"

1:12:16.416 --> 1:12:20.000
You're making me sound like
one funky cat. Thank you, sir.

1:12:20.083 --> 1:12:22.208
Last warning, Mr. Seale.

1:12:24.166 --> 1:12:25.791
Did he say anything else?

1:12:25.875 --> 1:12:28.166
He said, "The revolution at this time

1:12:28.250 --> 1:12:32.333
is directly connected
to organized guns in force."

1:12:34.541 --> 1:12:35.541
No more questions.

1:12:37.291 --> 1:12:41.166
Jive, double-lip talking.
Funky, funky cat.

1:12:41.250 --> 1:12:43.791
Would the defense like
to cross-examine the witness?

1:12:43.875 --> 1:12:48.166
Yes. I'm sittin' here saying that I would
like to cross-examine a witness.

1:12:48.250 --> 1:12:51.166
-Only lawyers can address a witness.
-My lawyer is Charles Garry.

1:12:51.250 --> 1:12:54.750
-I'm tired of hearing that.
-Couldn't care less what you're tired of.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:56.500
What did you say?

1:12:59.041 --> 1:13:04.125
I said it would be impossible for me
to care any less what you are tired of.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:07.208
And I demand to cross-examine the witness.

1:13:07.291 --> 1:13:09.416
[Hoffman] Sit in your chair and be quiet.

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:13.125
And don't ever address this court
in that manner again.

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.666
Are there any further questions?

1:13:20.750 --> 1:13:23.958
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume again--

1:13:24.041 --> 1:13:27.166
-It was premeditated murder!
-[man] Yes, it was!

1:13:27.250 --> 1:13:31.000
-Fred Hampton was assassinated last night!
-[Hoffman] Marshals, put Mr. Seale--

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:33.041
He wouldn't have been able to hold a gun!

1:13:33.125 --> 1:13:37.875
When they publish the coroner's report,
ask about the bullet in his shoulder!

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:44.375
I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale.

1:13:45.208 --> 1:13:46.958
I strongly caution--

1:13:47.041 --> 1:13:49.625
-Oh, strongly fuck yourself!
-[spectators gasp]

1:13:52.833 --> 1:13:55.041
Marshals, take that defendant into a room

1:13:55.125 --> 1:13:57.708
and deal with him
as he should be dealt with.

1:13:59.583 --> 1:14:00.958
[spectators murmuring]

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:06.083
[muffled grunts, gasps]

1:14:56.708 --> 1:14:58.333
[door opens]

1:14:58.416 --> 1:14:59.875
[spectators gasping]

1:15:20.916 --> 1:15:23.125
[gavel banging]

1:15:24.375 --> 1:15:29.333
Let the record show
that I tried, fairly and impartially.

1:15:29.416 --> 1:15:33.416
I tried to get the defendant
to sit on his own.

1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:35.708
I ask you again, Mr. Seale,

1:15:35.791 --> 1:15:39.250
and you may indicate
by raising your head up and down,

1:15:39.833 --> 1:15:42.083
or moving it from side to side,

1:15:42.166 --> 1:15:47.541
if I have your assurance that you will
not do anything to disrupt this trial,

1:15:47.625 --> 1:15:50.666
if I allow you to resume proper order.

1:15:51.958 --> 1:15:54.041
Do I have your assurance?

1:16:03.416 --> 1:16:05.125
Mr. Schultz, call your next witness.

1:16:09.750 --> 1:16:10.958
Mr. Schultz?

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.250
Your Honor, may we approach?

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.500
[Bill] Can he breathe?

1:16:29.333 --> 1:16:31.208
Can you breathe all right, Bobby?

1:16:37.625 --> 1:16:41.166
Your Honor, our defendant is gagged
and bound in an American courtroom.

1:16:41.250 --> 1:16:43.125
He brought it on himself.

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:44.166
Are you insane?

1:16:44.250 --> 1:16:45.375
Mr. Kunstler.

1:16:46.958 --> 1:16:48.500
Love of God.

1:16:49.416 --> 1:16:52.208
What do you want, Mr. Schultz?
This is your sidebar.

1:16:52.291 --> 1:16:55.875
The government would like to make a motion
that Bobby Seale be separated--

1:16:55.958 --> 1:16:57.958
-Wait, wait, wait--
-Sir, please.

1:16:58.583 --> 1:17:01.541
A motion that Bobby Seale be separated
from the rest of the defendants

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:03.750
and his case be declared a mistrial.

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:06.208
You want me to give him his mistrial?

1:17:06.291 --> 1:17:10.875
Of course, because you took that Black guy
and you made him a sympathetic character.

1:17:10.958 --> 1:17:15.625
Mr. Kunstler, I have lived
a very long time, sir.

1:17:15.708 --> 1:17:18.833
And you're the first person ever

1:17:18.916 --> 1:17:23.208
to suggest that I have discriminated
against a Black man.

1:17:23.291 --> 1:17:25.208
Then let the record show
that I am the second.

1:17:28.416 --> 1:17:29.375
Step back.

1:17:43.958 --> 1:17:48.125
I'm issuing an order declaring a mistrial
as to the defendant Bobby G. Seale.

1:17:48.208 --> 1:17:51.500
-[gavel bangs]
-[all cheering and clapping]

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:54.083
[gavel banging]

1:17:57.833 --> 1:18:02.708
Mr. Seale, you are currently charged
with 16 counts of contempt

1:18:02.791 --> 1:18:05.791
for your repeated displays of disrespect,

1:18:05.875 --> 1:18:09.708
and you have a pending homicide charge
in Connecticut.

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:15.166
You are not home free, sir,
and I doubt you ever will be.

1:18:16.500 --> 1:18:20.666
-We are adjourned until 10:00, Monday.
-[gavel bangs]

1:18:20.750 --> 1:18:21.916
[bailiff] All rise.

1:18:44.291 --> 1:18:45.625
[door opens]

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:48.666
[door closes]

1:18:51.750 --> 1:18:53.458
[telephone rings]

1:18:55.416 --> 1:18:57.500
Conspiracy Office, how can I help you?

1:19:03.333 --> 1:19:05.458
No, sir. I am a white woman.

1:19:09.208 --> 1:19:12.875
Yeah, I've slept with several
in my life so far, and on balance,

1:19:12.958 --> 1:19:14.500
I'd have to say it is better.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:16.958
I think that's a big part
of what's got you worked up.

1:19:17.041 --> 1:19:17.875
Hang up the phone.

1:19:17.958 --> 1:19:20.625
It's not so much that it's bigger.
It's just better.

1:19:20.708 --> 1:19:21.666
Hang up the phone.

1:19:24.125 --> 1:19:26.041
Was that a parting gift for Bobby?

1:19:27.083 --> 1:19:29.625
No. That was just for me.

1:19:43.083 --> 1:19:45.250
Why the fuck did you stand up?

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:46.875
It was a reflex.

1:19:46.958 --> 1:19:48.750
He was respecting the institution.

1:19:48.833 --> 1:19:52.916
I don't know what good it does to insult
the judge in view of the jury, the press,

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:56.375
and Foran and Schultz, who'll recommend
sentencing if we're convicted.

1:19:56.458 --> 1:19:59.791
It's a revolution, Tom.
We may have to hurt somebody's feelings.

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:03.541
So, um…

1:20:04.833 --> 1:20:06.416
we have this list.

1:20:06.500 --> 1:20:09.958
Maybe Monday morning,
we could read the names into the record

1:20:10.041 --> 1:20:11.166
as a way of saying--

1:20:11.250 --> 1:20:12.083
Saying what?

1:20:12.166 --> 1:20:16.458
That whatever we're facing, you know,
it's peanuts compared to what--

1:20:16.541 --> 1:20:19.750
He's gonna sentence us.
The judge decides what we're facing.

1:20:19.833 --> 1:20:22.666
-It is a goddamn trial.
-Political trial.

1:20:22.750 --> 1:20:26.125
No, we were arrested… The law
doesn't recognize political trials.

1:20:26.208 --> 1:20:29.083
No, we weren't arrested.
We were chosen.

1:20:32.125 --> 1:20:35.583
Lee, John, have you guys asked yourselves
what you're doing here?

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:36.500
Every day.

1:20:36.583 --> 1:20:38.083
[Abbie] You're a give-back.

1:20:38.166 --> 1:20:40.708
They give the jury
a couple of guys they can acquit

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:43.583
so they feel better
about finding the rest of us guilty.

1:20:46.583 --> 1:20:48.375
Lenny, am I wrong?

1:20:49.750 --> 1:20:50.583
No.

1:20:50.666 --> 1:20:54.666
Wait, so our role in history is that
we made it easier to convict our friends?

1:20:54.750 --> 1:20:57.541
They're gonna find us guilty
if they just don't like you.

1:20:57.625 --> 1:21:00.000
That's why Bill won't put us on the stand.

1:21:00.083 --> 1:21:02.666
I can take the stand.
I'm easier for them to like.

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:05.625
I'm literally a Boy Scout troop leader.

1:21:05.708 --> 1:21:07.791
[laughing]

1:21:10.958 --> 1:21:13.291
You're a conscientious objector.

1:21:13.375 --> 1:21:15.250
A lot of people
are conscientious objectors.

1:21:15.333 --> 1:21:16.500
During World War II?

1:21:16.583 --> 1:21:20.125
You sat out World War II.
Even I wanna punch you.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:23.458
-We can talk about that.
-[Bill] I'm looking forward to it.

1:21:23.541 --> 1:21:25.208
[Jerry] I could take the stand.

1:21:25.291 --> 1:21:27.916
Mr. Rubin, you ever taught a classroom
how to make a bomb?

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.916
Man, eighth graders are taught
how Oppenheimer made a bomb.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.125
Not one you can build
with materials from Woolworth's.

1:21:34.208 --> 1:21:35.625
You know what'd be ironic?

1:21:36.416 --> 1:21:38.416
-What?
-[Rennie] I said, know what--

1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:40.750
He heard you.
He's asking what would be ironic.

1:21:40.833 --> 1:21:45.541
I was gonna say if John Mitchell did
all this just to get back at Ramsey Clark.

1:21:45.625 --> 1:21:47.583
-[Tom] For what?
-[Rennie] That thing, remember?

1:21:47.666 --> 1:21:50.375
Outgoing cabinet members
are supposed to resign,

1:21:50.458 --> 1:21:53.250
but Ramsey Clark didn't tender
his resignation till--

1:21:53.333 --> 1:21:55.375
[Jerry] I read Mitchell
had a fit about that.

1:21:55.458 --> 1:21:58.416
-[Rennie] Yeah.
-[Jerry] Did you read about that, Lenny?

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.000
Bill?

1:22:00.958 --> 1:22:03.083
He was never even on our witness list.

1:22:03.166 --> 1:22:04.166
Who?

1:22:04.250 --> 1:22:08.833
-The first witness you put on the stand--
-If this was a political trial…

1:22:09.666 --> 1:22:11.416
-Bernadine.
-Yeah.

1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:13.791
I need my office to find Ramsey Clark.

1:22:14.541 --> 1:22:17.291
And William Kunstler just showed up.

1:22:32.416 --> 1:22:33.250
[Bill] Len.

1:22:38.291 --> 1:22:41.416
Maybe… I don't know,
does he have a Secret Service detail?

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:44.541
Nah, they're here for us.

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:52.458
He was the attorney general.
What do we do?

1:22:52.541 --> 1:22:55.416
-We just ring the doorbell?
-[Leonard] Yeah, I guess so.

1:22:56.958 --> 1:22:59.250
-You wanna do it?
-Just ring the damn…

1:22:59.333 --> 1:23:00.708
[doorbell rings]

1:23:01.875 --> 1:23:03.041
[door opens]

1:23:04.916 --> 1:23:08.125
Good morning, I'm Bill Kunstler.
Mr. Clark is expecting us.

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:09.041
[woman] Come in.

1:23:14.041 --> 1:23:15.041
[Tom] Good morning.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.166
He's in his study at the end of the hall.

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:24.000
Can I get anyone coffee?

1:23:24.083 --> 1:23:26.375
I tell you what, ma'am.
That sounds great.

1:23:26.458 --> 1:23:27.791
Nothing for me. Thank you.

1:23:28.625 --> 1:23:30.208
[woman] At the end of the hall.

1:23:31.166 --> 1:23:32.375
Mr. Hayden?

1:23:33.541 --> 1:23:36.750
I read in the paper you were
the only one who stood for the judge

1:23:36.833 --> 1:23:38.416
after what he did to Bobby.

1:23:40.125 --> 1:23:43.500
Uh, that was a mistake.
It was just a reflex.

1:23:43.583 --> 1:23:44.416
[Bill] Tom?

1:23:55.750 --> 1:23:56.708
[Clark] Hey, Bill.

1:23:58.416 --> 1:23:59.583
Ramsey Clark.

1:24:00.458 --> 1:24:01.791
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1:24:03.083 --> 1:24:05.250
This is Leonard Weinglass.

1:24:05.333 --> 1:24:07.583
-Mr. Weinglass.
-[Bill] And Tom Hayden.

1:24:07.666 --> 1:24:09.208
Oh, I know who Tom Hayden is.

1:24:09.291 --> 1:24:11.541
The FBI used to work for me.

1:24:12.791 --> 1:24:16.333
Those two men, they're senior deputies
with the Justice Department.

1:24:16.416 --> 1:24:17.750
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ackerman.

1:24:19.166 --> 1:24:22.083
-I don't know why these men are here.
-I invited them.

1:24:22.666 --> 1:24:23.541
You invited them?

1:24:23.625 --> 1:24:26.166
I don't want
the appearance of impropriety.

1:24:26.250 --> 1:24:27.750
There isn't any impropriety.

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:30.041
And now there are witnesses to that.

1:24:30.125 --> 1:24:34.875
Sir, these men are gonna call 
Schultz and Foran as soon as we're done.

1:24:34.958 --> 1:24:38.250
Don't be ridiculous.
They already called Schultz and Foran.

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:41.500
And they're gonna call John Mitchell
as soon as we're done here.

1:24:42.125 --> 1:24:43.791
Go ahead, ask what you wanna ask.

1:24:45.083 --> 1:24:47.416
-In front of them?
-Yeah.

1:24:51.250 --> 1:24:52.250
All right.

1:24:53.208 --> 1:24:57.375
Mr. Clark, while you were
attorney general for President Johnson

1:24:57.458 --> 1:24:59.625
was there ever any discussion
with the White House

1:24:59.708 --> 1:25:01.875
about seeking indictments
against my clients?

1:25:01.958 --> 1:25:03.791
-He can't answer that.
-Why not?

1:25:03.875 --> 1:25:04.875
It's against the law.

1:25:04.958 --> 1:25:08.041
That's an overly broad
interpretation of the law.

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:10.000
-If you'd like--
-[Bill] I'll tell you what.

1:25:10.083 --> 1:25:12.291
We've dealt with
jury tampering, wiretapping,

1:25:12.375 --> 1:25:14.541
a defendant that was literally gagged,

1:25:14.625 --> 1:25:17.291
and a judge who's been
handing down rulings from the bench

1:25:17.375 --> 1:25:19.625
that would be
considered wrong in Honduras.

1:25:19.708 --> 1:25:23.916
So I'm a little less interested in the law
than I was when this trial began.

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.375
Well, whether you like the law or not,
as former AG, he is protected by it.

1:25:29.458 --> 1:25:31.166
No, you are protected by it.

1:25:32.166 --> 1:25:34.833
And with respect, sir, I can subpoena you.

1:25:34.916 --> 1:25:37.750
Find a judge in this circuit
who will sign that subpoena.

1:25:37.833 --> 1:25:41.583
He's right. And taking the stand
voluntarily would be a big risk for me.

1:25:42.166 --> 1:25:43.916
Well, again, with due respect, sir,

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:47.375
my clients take
a much bigger risk when they…

1:25:48.083 --> 1:25:51.000
-stand against an enormous power…
-[Clark] What took you so long?

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:53.708
…that they can't even see, and that…

1:25:54.666 --> 1:25:57.083
I'm sorry.
What took me so long to do what?

1:25:57.166 --> 1:25:59.125
To realize I'm your star witness.

1:26:02.041 --> 1:26:04.708
-We were remarking upon that ourselves--
-Bill…

1:26:04.791 --> 1:26:06.000
He can't testify.

1:26:06.083 --> 1:26:08.458
I'm in private practice now.

1:26:08.541 --> 1:26:11.208
And if John Mitchell
wants to cut me in half,

1:26:11.291 --> 1:26:12.916
he can and he will.

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.500
You have to find some…

1:26:15.750 --> 1:26:17.916
Sir, you have to find some courage now…

1:26:19.208 --> 1:26:21.958
-And--
-Find some courage? Yeah.

1:26:22.041 --> 1:26:24.708
Yes. You have to find some courage and--

1:26:24.791 --> 1:26:25.750
Tom.

1:26:29.583 --> 1:26:32.041
That's what those two men came to tell me,

1:26:32.125 --> 1:26:36.083
that if John Mitchell wants to
cut me in half, he can and he will.

1:26:36.666 --> 1:26:40.833
So I wanted them in the room when I said,

1:26:41.708 --> 1:26:43.041
"When do you want me in court?"

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:46.958
Mr. Clark?

1:26:47.583 --> 1:26:48.583
I'm sorry?

1:26:49.125 --> 1:26:50.458
Swear me in, Bill.

1:26:50.541 --> 1:26:55.000
It is against the law for you to testify,
Ramsey. It is as simple as that.

1:26:55.791 --> 1:26:57.083
It's General Clark.

1:26:57.791 --> 1:26:59.958
And arrest me or shut the fuck up.

1:27:05.333 --> 1:27:06.375
Found some.

1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:11.041
Your Honor, the People move
to disallow this witness.

1:27:11.125 --> 1:27:14.083
I'm sure the defense anticipated that.

1:27:14.166 --> 1:27:16.125
[Schultz] Code of
federal regulations mandates

1:27:16.208 --> 1:27:18.500
the disclosure
of Justice Department materials

1:27:18.583 --> 1:27:21.625
is prohibited without prior knowledge
of the attorney general,

1:27:21.708 --> 1:27:24.666
plainly meaning
the sitting attorney general,

1:27:24.750 --> 1:27:27.583
who is John Mitchell,
who has denied his approval.

1:27:27.666 --> 1:27:32.541
Judge, the rule refers only to
very specific documents and information.

1:27:32.625 --> 1:27:36.333
If the regulation were interpreted
as Mr. Schultz is asking it to be,

1:27:36.416 --> 1:27:38.250
nobody in the federal government

1:27:38.333 --> 1:27:41.750
could ever testify in any trial
after they left their job.

1:27:43.875 --> 1:27:46.583
I think the government
is at least justified

1:27:46.666 --> 1:27:50.166
in asking the defense
to demonstrate, by voir dire,

1:27:50.250 --> 1:27:53.083
the testimony it expects
to elicit from the witness.

1:27:53.166 --> 1:27:56.916
You'd like us to question the witness,
this witness,

1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.833
outside the presence of the jury?

1:27:59.916 --> 1:28:04.416
If I find any of the testimony relevant,
I'll call the jury back in to hear it.

1:28:05.375 --> 1:28:07.083
Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler.

1:28:10.458 --> 1:28:12.750
Defense calls Ramsey Clark.

1:28:25.833 --> 1:28:26.916
State your name.

1:28:27.416 --> 1:28:30.625
-[Clark] William Ramsey Clark.
-Do you swear the testimony you give

1:28:30.708 --> 1:28:33.250
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1:28:33.333 --> 1:28:34.166
[Clark] I do.

1:28:37.291 --> 1:28:42.708
Mr. Clark, what was your occupation
in the summer of 1968?

1:28:42.791 --> 1:28:45.166
I was the attorney general
of the United States.

1:28:45.250 --> 1:28:47.791
-You were appointed by President Johnson?
-Yes.

1:28:47.875 --> 1:28:51.208
-Confirmed by the United States Senate.
-Yes.

1:28:51.291 --> 1:28:56.541
Now, did you receive a phone call
at your office at 11:50 a.m.,

1:28:56.625 --> 1:28:59.041
on September 10th of last year?

1:28:59.125 --> 1:28:59.958
Yes.

1:29:00.041 --> 1:29:02.208
-And from whom was that call?
-President Johnson.

1:29:02.291 --> 1:29:07.750
Will you state what President Johnson
said to you and what was said to him?

1:29:07.833 --> 1:29:10.125
Your Honor, at this point, we will object.

1:29:10.208 --> 1:29:13.875
A cabinet officer does not have to,
and should not have to relate the contents

1:29:13.958 --> 1:29:17.250
of a private call he had
with the president.

1:29:17.333 --> 1:29:19.000
I'll sustain the objection.

1:29:19.083 --> 1:29:22.458
Please, the court… This is voir dire.

1:29:22.541 --> 1:29:25.166
I thought objections were reserved.

1:29:25.250 --> 1:29:28.291
There's a question of
attorney-client privilege to consider.

1:29:28.375 --> 1:29:31.208
[Clark] The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1:29:34.875 --> 1:29:36.125
Excuse me, sir?

1:29:36.708 --> 1:29:39.750
The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1:29:39.833 --> 1:29:40.833
I'm happy to answer.

1:29:40.916 --> 1:29:42.375
[Schultz] Your Honor…

1:29:44.375 --> 1:29:47.833
Hearing from the witness
on this point is highly irregular.

1:29:49.041 --> 1:29:51.833
Well, gentlemen, um…

1:29:53.583 --> 1:29:55.083
This is my courtroom.

1:29:55.833 --> 1:29:59.500
But the witness is the former, uh…

1:29:59.583 --> 1:30:03.166
He's just stated
his willingness, you know,

1:30:03.250 --> 1:30:07.291
so, for the purposes of voir dire,
I'll hear the answer.

1:30:08.333 --> 1:30:09.166
Thank you.

1:30:09.958 --> 1:30:15.541
Mr. Clark, uh, did President Johnson
ask you a question in that phone call?

1:30:16.416 --> 1:30:20.000
The president asked me
if I intended to seek any indictments

1:30:20.083 --> 1:30:23.500
related to the riots
the previous month in Chicago.

1:30:24.416 --> 1:30:25.916
And what did you tell him?

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.583
I told him we wouldn't be
seeking indictments.

1:30:28.666 --> 1:30:30.208
And can you tell us why?

1:30:30.291 --> 1:30:34.708
An investigation by our criminal division
led to the conclusion

1:30:34.791 --> 1:30:37.500
that the riots were started
by the Chicago Police Department.

1:30:37.583 --> 1:30:39.708
[all cheering and clapping]

1:30:42.041 --> 1:30:43.833
[gavel banging]

1:30:52.750 --> 1:30:56.333
And, Mr. Clark,
did your counterintelligence division

1:30:56.416 --> 1:30:58.000
make a report as well?

1:30:58.083 --> 1:31:01.958
They concluded that there was
no conspiracy by the defendants

1:31:02.041 --> 1:31:04.958
to incite violence during the convention.

1:31:05.041 --> 1:31:07.250
And then what happened
on the first Tuesday,

1:31:07.333 --> 1:31:09.875
after the first Monday,
in November of that year?

1:31:09.958 --> 1:31:12.375
-Richard Nixon was elected president.
-Sustained.

1:31:12.458 --> 1:31:14.333
-Nobody objected--
-[Schultz] We do.

1:31:14.416 --> 1:31:17.000
It's well-known there's no love lost
between the witness

1:31:17.083 --> 1:31:18.625
and the sitting attorney general.

1:31:18.708 --> 1:31:21.083
This witness was called to wage
a political attack

1:31:21.166 --> 1:31:23.250
and should not be allowed before the jury.

1:31:23.333 --> 1:31:24.166
Mr. Kunstler.

1:31:24.250 --> 1:31:26.541
Your Honor, you cannot
possibly be considering

1:31:26.625 --> 1:31:29.916
not allowing the jury to hear
what we've just heard?

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.041
The witness can't present them testimony

1:31:32.125 --> 1:31:34.916
that would assist in making
a determination of guilt or innocence.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.500
He just testified his own Justice
Department came to the conclusion--

1:31:38.583 --> 1:31:40.166
The current Justice Department,

1:31:40.250 --> 1:31:42.291
the one that matters,
came to a new conclusion.

1:31:42.375 --> 1:31:46.166
Therefore, motivation of the prosecution
has to be called into question.

1:31:46.250 --> 1:31:49.750
The motivation of the prosecution
is not an issue in a courtroom.

1:31:49.833 --> 1:31:53.750
In any courtroom I've ever been in,
except this one.

1:31:53.833 --> 1:31:54.833
Object.

1:31:54.916 --> 1:31:57.458
[Hoffman] Mr. Kunstler, do you have
any further examination

1:31:57.541 --> 1:32:01.583
that will demonstrate that this witness
will make a material contribution,

1:32:01.666 --> 1:32:04.291
or should I just ask him to step down?

1:32:04.375 --> 1:32:06.375
You've ruled.

1:32:10.250 --> 1:32:13.458
You're not gonna let the jury
hear his testimony.

1:32:13.541 --> 1:32:16.041
Not unless you can demonstrate to me,

1:32:16.125 --> 1:32:18.833
which you have not thus far done,
that this witness--

1:32:18.916 --> 1:32:22.041
-Are you any good?
-Are you addressing the court reporter?

1:32:22.125 --> 1:32:23.583
-Keep up with us.
-Mr. Kunstler--

1:32:23.666 --> 1:32:25.375
Is this prosecution politically motivated?

1:32:25.458 --> 1:32:26.958
-Object!
-Yes.

1:32:27.041 --> 1:32:29.125
President Nixon inherited
an unpopular war.

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:30.458
-Yes.
-Step down, Mr. Clark.

1:32:30.541 --> 1:32:32.875
And your clients make it
more unpopular every day.

1:32:32.958 --> 1:32:37.625
This administration is paranoid
about the SDS, the Mobe, the New Left…

1:32:37.708 --> 1:32:39.666
[Hoffman] Mr. Clark, please.

1:32:40.375 --> 1:32:44.791
Please, sir. I will be forced
to find you in contempt.

1:32:45.416 --> 1:32:46.625
Do you understand?

1:32:49.250 --> 1:32:50.208
I do, Your Honor.

1:32:50.708 --> 1:32:52.625
Then step down, please.

1:32:56.291 --> 1:32:57.458
Thank you, sir.

1:33:06.625 --> 1:33:08.375
Just get to work on the appeal.

1:33:18.541 --> 1:33:21.250
Your Honor, when the jury returns,

1:33:22.416 --> 1:33:26.250
will they be informed
that the defense had called

1:33:26.333 --> 1:33:29.416
the former attorney general
of the United States of America,

1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:33.250
but this court ruled
that he couldn't testify?

1:33:34.041 --> 1:33:36.250
No, that motion will be denied.

1:33:36.333 --> 1:33:38.875
[spectators murmuring]

1:33:56.041 --> 1:33:59.583
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his third count of contempt.

1:34:05.875 --> 1:34:07.125
[David] You're a thug.

1:34:07.208 --> 1:34:09.416
Did one of the defendants speak?

1:34:09.500 --> 1:34:13.291
I did. I said you're a thug,
because you are.

1:34:13.375 --> 1:34:15.125
-Dave.
-Please sit, Mr. Dellinger.

1:34:15.208 --> 1:34:17.666
-If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?
-[Leonard] Dave.

1:34:17.750 --> 1:34:19.375
Marshals, seat the defendant.

1:34:19.458 --> 1:34:22.750
If we're guilty,
which you have clearly decided--

1:34:22.833 --> 1:34:24.333
-Dave, I've got--
-Watch yourself.

1:34:24.416 --> 1:34:26.708
You've clearly decided
that we were, why not--

1:34:26.791 --> 1:34:29.333
No. You don't…
No, you don't need to grab my arm.

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.958
If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?

1:34:35.041 --> 1:34:38.541
I mean, I have sat here for six months
and watched you!

1:34:38.625 --> 1:34:40.958
You don't need to grab my arm.

1:34:41.041 --> 1:34:43.250
I have watched you. I've watched you--

1:34:43.333 --> 1:34:44.333
Sir-- [grunts]

1:34:44.416 --> 1:34:45.625
[spectators gasp]

1:34:47.166 --> 1:34:49.541
[Jerry] It's okay.
He would not hurt a fly.

1:34:49.625 --> 1:34:51.208
Take him out of here. Lock him up.

1:34:52.916 --> 1:34:54.583
[handcuffs clinking]

1:34:54.666 --> 1:34:55.875
I hit him.

1:34:57.625 --> 1:34:58.875
I'm sorry.

1:35:08.041 --> 1:35:09.083
[softly] I'm sorry.

1:35:27.583 --> 1:35:29.833
[telephone ringing]

1:35:42.958 --> 1:35:45.791
There's only one thing.
There's one thing to do.

1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:47.875
Solidarity with Dave.

1:35:49.583 --> 1:35:52.291
Tomorrow, we go into court
and get ourselves arrested.

1:35:53.208 --> 1:35:54.541
We're already arrested.

1:35:55.250 --> 1:35:57.541
Is Bill talking to you
about taking the stand?

1:35:58.166 --> 1:36:01.041
The press guys are saying
Bill's been talking to you about it.

1:36:01.125 --> 1:36:02.458
He's been talking about it.

1:36:02.541 --> 1:36:05.833
He thinks you might get the crowd
worked up with a position paper?

1:36:05.916 --> 1:36:09.416
Maybe he thinks I won't try
to get the crowd worked up at all.

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.666
Maybe he thinks there are jurors
who relied on the safety of the police

1:36:13.750 --> 1:36:15.916
and are put off
when someone calls them pigs,

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.416
or maybe he wants a witness
who dresses like a grown man.

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:24.041
The cops in this city
in the summer of 1968 were pigs.

1:36:24.625 --> 1:36:26.750
I wonder how many of them
had kids in Vietnam.

1:36:28.625 --> 1:36:30.458
He's gonna take the stand, not you?

1:36:30.541 --> 1:36:32.291
And we're okay with that?

1:36:33.916 --> 1:36:34.750
Abbie?

1:36:34.833 --> 1:36:37.708
What did you mean,
the last thing I want is to end the war?

1:36:38.291 --> 1:36:39.166
What?

1:36:39.250 --> 1:36:43.375
Centuries ago when the trial started,
you said, why did I come to Chicago?

1:36:43.458 --> 1:36:45.500
And I said, "To end the war."

1:36:45.583 --> 1:36:48.333
And then you turned to everyone
and you said,

1:36:48.416 --> 1:36:51.500
"The last thing he wants
is to end the war."

1:36:53.625 --> 1:36:54.958
What did you mean by that?

1:36:55.500 --> 1:36:57.500
That you're making the most
of your close-up.

1:36:57.583 --> 1:36:58.666
Yeah…

1:36:58.750 --> 1:37:01.291
-No more war, no Abbie Hoffman.
-What's your problem with me?

1:37:01.875 --> 1:37:03.875
I wish people would stop asking me that.

1:37:03.958 --> 1:37:06.083
-Dave wouldn't want us to--
-Answer it.

1:37:06.166 --> 1:37:07.250
One time.

1:37:08.041 --> 1:37:12.750
All right. My problem
is that for the next 50 years

1:37:12.833 --> 1:37:15.958
when people think of progressive politics,
they're gonna think of you.

1:37:16.041 --> 1:37:18.791
They're gonna think of you
and your idiot followers

1:37:18.875 --> 1:37:22.416
passing out daisies to soldiers
and trying to levitate the Pentagon.

1:37:22.500 --> 1:37:25.458
So they're not gonna think
of equality or justice,

1:37:25.541 --> 1:37:29.083
they're not gonna think
of education or poverty or progress.

1:37:29.166 --> 1:37:31.958
They're gonna think
of a bunch of stoned, lost,

1:37:32.041 --> 1:37:35.583
disrespectful, foul-mouthed,
lawless losers,

1:37:36.166 --> 1:37:37.750
and so we'll lose elections.

1:37:38.833 --> 1:37:39.833
All because of me?

1:37:40.708 --> 1:37:41.541
Yeah.

1:37:41.625 --> 1:37:44.333
Winning elections is the first thing
on your wish list?

1:37:44.416 --> 1:37:48.500
Equality, justice, education, poverty
and progress, they're second?

1:37:49.083 --> 1:37:52.416
If you don't win elections,
it doesn't matter what's second.

1:37:52.958 --> 1:37:57.041
And it is astonishing to me that
someone still has to explain that to you.

1:37:57.125 --> 1:37:58.000
[Rennie] Okay.

1:37:58.833 --> 1:38:01.416
Okay, so, uh, Jerry was
talking about standing--

1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:02.708
We don't have any money.

1:38:02.791 --> 1:38:04.000
I'm sorry, what?

1:38:04.083 --> 1:38:05.583
We don't have any money.

1:38:06.500 --> 1:38:09.833
So I stage stunts, and cameras come
and microphones come,

1:38:09.916 --> 1:38:13.583
and it's astonishing that someone
still has to explain that to you.

1:38:13.666 --> 1:38:16.208
You're trading a cow for magic beans.

1:38:16.291 --> 1:38:17.875
[Jerry] That ended up working.

1:38:17.958 --> 1:38:19.083
What?

1:38:19.166 --> 1:38:21.958
The magic beans.
There was a giant up there.

1:38:22.041 --> 1:38:23.041
Oh, for fuck's--

1:38:23.916 --> 1:38:27.333
I can't remember what happened after that.
The little boy may have gotten eaten--

1:38:27.416 --> 1:38:29.125
[John] The giant turned out to be nice.

1:38:29.208 --> 1:38:31.208
-[Jerry] Are you sure?
-No.

1:38:31.291 --> 1:38:33.916
It's hard to believe the seven of us
weren't able to end a war.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.125
Let me ask you something…

1:38:35.208 --> 1:38:36.458
You guys should shake hands.

1:38:36.541 --> 1:38:39.875
Think Chicago would've gone differently
if Kennedy got the nomination?

1:38:39.958 --> 1:38:41.500
Do I… [chuckles]

1:38:41.583 --> 1:38:43.000
-Just…
-[laughs] Yeah.

1:38:43.625 --> 1:38:46.708
Yes, I do. I think the Irish guys
would have sat down with Daley,

1:38:46.791 --> 1:38:47.875
and… Yes.

1:38:47.958 --> 1:38:49.750
-I think so too.
-Yeah?

1:38:49.833 --> 1:38:51.041
That's why I was wondering.

1:38:51.958 --> 1:38:54.208
Weren't you just a little bit happy

1:38:54.291 --> 1:38:57.083
when the bullet ripped through his head?

1:38:57.916 --> 1:39:01.083
No Chicago, no Tom Hayden.

1:39:01.875 --> 1:39:04.666
I was one of the pallbearers,
you fucking animal!

1:39:04.750 --> 1:39:08.250
That's right, we're not goin' to jail
because of what we did,

1:39:08.333 --> 1:39:10.083
we're goin' to jail because of who we are!

1:39:10.166 --> 1:39:13.666
Think about that the next time
you shrug off cultural revolution.

1:39:15.375 --> 1:39:18.041
We define winning differently, you and I.

1:39:20.833 --> 1:39:22.541
Bill, you should've seen it.

1:39:22.625 --> 1:39:26.125
Tom tried to beat me up, but through
sheer force of intellectual superiority--

1:39:26.208 --> 1:39:29.083
[Bill] Stop talking. Just stop talking.

1:39:29.875 --> 1:39:32.958
Foran's office turned this over tonight.

1:39:33.041 --> 1:39:34.250
In discovery.

1:39:35.208 --> 1:39:37.541
It was given to them
by somebody in the crowd.

1:39:37.625 --> 1:39:40.250
No foul play, there are affidavits.

1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:42.916
They really did just get this.

1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000
[Tom] What's on the tape?

1:39:44.083 --> 1:39:47.041
The sound of you
starting the Chicago riot.

1:39:49.333 --> 1:39:50.250
Hey. What?

1:39:52.833 --> 1:39:56.083
Somebody had a tape recorder
by the bandshell. They got you saying it.

1:39:56.166 --> 1:39:58.958
It's a clear tape.
You can't take the stand.

1:39:59.041 --> 1:40:00.625
-I can handle Schultz and the tape.
-No.

1:40:00.708 --> 1:40:02.333
They'll play the tape anyway, right?

1:40:02.416 --> 1:40:05.416
If you take the stand, they'll make you
answer for it, and you can't.

1:40:06.291 --> 1:40:09.458
-They'd just cracked Rennie's head open.
-So you started a riot.

1:40:09.541 --> 1:40:11.458
-Defense rests.
-They had just cracked--

1:40:11.541 --> 1:40:13.666
-If blood is gonna flow…
-[Tom] Bill…

1:40:13.750 --> 1:40:15.541
…let it flow all over the city.

1:40:15.625 --> 1:40:18.333
-They'd just clubbed Rennie.
-Everybody kept their cool.

1:40:18.416 --> 1:40:21.625
Abbie, Dave...
Shit, this guy kept his cool.

1:40:21.708 --> 1:40:23.166
You're the one who lost it.

1:40:23.250 --> 1:40:24.708
I can take the stand.

1:40:25.458 --> 1:40:28.375
[Bill] You wanna hear what cross
from Schultz will sound like?

1:40:28.458 --> 1:40:30.791
Sure. I'll show you
what my answers will sound like.

1:40:30.875 --> 1:40:34.416
They called him a radical,
they called him a criminal!

1:40:35.083 --> 1:40:37.958
-They called him "Un-American."
-[crowd cheering]

1:40:38.041 --> 1:40:41.291
[Tom] First of all, it turned out the guy
climbing the flagpole was a kid.

1:40:41.375 --> 1:40:44.750
It seems like you guys attract
an awful lot of underage minors.

1:40:44.833 --> 1:40:46.750
-Do you wanna object?
-Objection.

1:40:46.833 --> 1:40:48.666
-Overruled.
-[Tom] We attract the people

1:40:48.750 --> 1:40:51.041
who have the most to lose
by this war continuing.

1:40:51.125 --> 1:40:53.041
I'm glad you brought that up.
Did you serve?

1:40:53.125 --> 1:40:55.791
I wasn't drafted.
I didn't try to evade the…

1:40:55.875 --> 1:40:58.750
-I had a high number.
-High number? But you didn't enlist?

1:40:58.833 --> 1:41:01.166
I did not volunteer
to kill Vietnamese people, no.

1:41:01.250 --> 1:41:05.375
You testified you saw at least
six policemen start to go after the man…

1:41:05.458 --> 1:41:08.083
Sorry, the kid
who was climbing the flagpole?

1:41:08.166 --> 1:41:09.416
-Yes.
-[Bill] It was dark.

1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:12.666
You were 100 yards away.
What do you have, telescopic night-vision?

1:41:12.750 --> 1:41:14.000
There were floodlights.

1:41:14.083 --> 1:41:18.208
And when they called him
anti-American, he said, "No,

1:41:18.291 --> 1:41:24.041
that ignominious distinction goes
to those who mouth America's values

1:41:24.916 --> 1:41:27.208
while breaking America's heart."

1:41:29.041 --> 1:41:31.083
I'd like to introduce you now

1:41:31.166 --> 1:41:33.041
to Carl Oglesby of the SDS!

1:41:33.125 --> 1:41:34.833
[officer] Come on!

1:41:36.291 --> 1:41:39.041
Hey, it's all right. He's a kid.
We'll get him down.

1:41:41.750 --> 1:41:44.000
Isn't it great to be here in Chicago!

1:41:44.083 --> 1:41:46.041
[all cheering]

1:41:47.833 --> 1:41:49.958
[officer] Come here.
Son of a bitch!

1:41:50.041 --> 1:41:51.333
Hey, leave the kid alone!

1:41:52.333 --> 1:41:53.875
-[officer] Hold him!
-[Rennie] Hey!

1:41:53.958 --> 1:41:55.416
Jesus! What is wrong with…

1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:57.500
Rennie was trying
to get the police off of the kid.

1:41:57.583 --> 1:41:59.041
"Get the police off of the kid."

1:41:59.125 --> 1:42:00.041
-[Tom] Yes.
-How?

1:42:00.125 --> 1:42:01.833
-[sighs] He was--
-Grabbing them?

1:42:01.916 --> 1:42:04.250
Get off of him! Hey! Get the--

1:42:04.333 --> 1:42:07.625
I'd like to say to the cops back there
that we're allowed to be here.

1:42:07.708 --> 1:42:10.125
-We have permits for this.
-And out of nowhere…

1:42:10.208 --> 1:42:12.250
[grunts]

1:42:12.333 --> 1:42:15.791
It was six armed police officers versus
Rennie and a pocket protector.

1:42:15.875 --> 1:42:17.416
I can understand that response.

1:42:17.500 --> 1:42:19.541
How about your response? Let's press play.

1:42:20.041 --> 1:42:21.500
[John] We're gonna need medics…

1:42:21.583 --> 1:42:23.458
The whole world is watching.

1:42:23.541 --> 1:42:27.041
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!

1:42:27.541 --> 1:42:29.125
They've just beaten Rennie, Dave.

1:42:29.208 --> 1:42:31.875
Listen. We can still get
everyone out of here safely.

1:42:31.958 --> 1:42:33.250
No, we can't.

1:42:33.333 --> 1:42:36.750
[all chanting]
The whole world is watching!

1:42:36.833 --> 1:42:38.625
The whole world is watching!

1:42:39.125 --> 1:42:42.333
Dellinger tried to stop you from saying
what you were about to say.

1:42:42.416 --> 1:42:43.791
Tell them to stay calm.

1:42:43.875 --> 1:42:45.541
[crowd continues chanting]

1:42:45.625 --> 1:42:47.500
-No.
-The whole world is watching!

1:42:47.583 --> 1:42:49.833
-Tom?
-Did you tell 'em to stay calm?

1:42:49.916 --> 1:42:54.958
Wait, Rennie Davis has just been
beaten by the police.

1:42:55.041 --> 1:42:58.500
Rennie's skull has been cracked open.

1:42:58.583 --> 1:43:01.083
-Did you tell your crowd to stay calm--
-Bill--

1:43:01.166 --> 1:43:04.375
I'm Richard Schultz, Tom.
And John Mitchell told me to win.

1:43:04.458 --> 1:43:06.750
Did you tell your crowd
to stay calm or--

1:43:06.833 --> 1:43:08.541
Yes. If blood is gonna flow…

1:43:08.625 --> 1:43:10.916
…let it flow all over the city!

1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.458
-God damn it! Tom!
-[Tom] If gas is gonna be used,

1:43:13.541 --> 1:43:16.000
let it come down all over Chicago!

1:43:16.083 --> 1:43:18.916
We're going to the convention!
Let's get on the streets!

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.625
Get on the street!

1:43:21.750 --> 1:43:25.458
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city."

1:43:26.083 --> 1:43:28.958
What was that, an order
to start a peaceful demonstration?

1:43:29.041 --> 1:43:30.500
[crowd clamoring]

1:43:34.708 --> 1:43:37.625
Once you had a moment to settle down,
did you try and stop people?

1:43:37.708 --> 1:43:40.166
[tear gas canisters firing]

1:43:47.958 --> 1:43:50.708
-Fuck you!
-Get off him!

1:43:59.291 --> 1:44:02.333
-You didn't try and stop anyone.
-No.

1:44:02.416 --> 1:44:06.375
[Tom] The bridges!
Head to the bridges! The bridges!

1:44:06.458 --> 1:44:08.541
You told them to go to the footbridges.

1:44:08.625 --> 1:44:12.208
The ones able to make it out of the park
without getting arrested or maimed.

1:44:12.291 --> 1:44:14.875
And those people,
the ones you sent to the footbridges,

1:44:14.958 --> 1:44:17.000
did they know what was on the other side?

1:44:24.541 --> 1:44:26.708
[officer] You are ordered
to turn around immediately.

1:44:26.791 --> 1:44:28.958
All access to the convention was blocked.

1:44:29.041 --> 1:44:31.666
-[Tom] By an armored division.
-The Illinois National Guard.

1:44:31.750 --> 1:44:32.833
They're the good guys.

1:44:32.916 --> 1:44:35.500
Jeeps fitted with concertina wire
called Daley dozers.

1:44:37.833 --> 1:44:39.708
When did I stop being
one of the good guys?

1:44:39.791 --> 1:44:42.833
Let's find out.
Were glass bottles thrown at the police?

1:44:42.916 --> 1:44:44.333
We want justice!

1:44:45.833 --> 1:44:48.958
No, don't approach! Stay back! Stay…

1:44:49.041 --> 1:44:51.916
Some people threw bottles.
Dave was trying to shut it down.

1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:53.833
We were frustrated.
All three footbridges--

1:44:53.916 --> 1:44:56.708
So you, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
eluded the police.

1:44:56.791 --> 1:44:59.416
I wouldn't say we eluded them.
We were fleeing from them.

1:44:59.500 --> 1:45:00.958
Found an unguarded bridge…

1:45:05.833 --> 1:45:07.750
Now here's where things got weird.

1:45:07.833 --> 1:45:11.750
You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
found the only way to the convention.

1:45:12.500 --> 1:45:15.291
In the lobby of the Hilton,
right next to the convention center,

1:45:15.375 --> 1:45:17.791
is a bar called the Haymarket Tavern.

1:45:17.875 --> 1:45:21.125
The Haymarket Tavern is a watering hole

1:45:21.208 --> 1:45:23.625
for Chicago's political class
and their hookers.

1:45:23.708 --> 1:45:25.750
[crowd laughing]

1:45:25.833 --> 1:45:30.208
And the place was packed to watch Humphrey
getting the nomination a mile away.

1:45:30.291 --> 1:45:32.000
[man on TV]
From the House of Representatives

1:45:32.083 --> 1:45:34.375
who represents the great state of Ohio,

1:45:34.458 --> 1:45:36.541
representative Wayne Hays to the stage.

1:45:36.625 --> 1:45:38.500
[Hays] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1:45:38.583 --> 1:45:41.250
The great state of Ohio,
the Buckeye State--

1:45:41.333 --> 1:45:42.583
[all] The Buckeye State!

1:45:43.500 --> 1:45:47.625
One side of the Haymarket Tavern
is a picture window with smoked glass.

1:45:47.708 --> 1:45:49.916
You can't see inside it from the street.

1:45:50.875 --> 1:45:52.500
You made it through the riot police,

1:45:52.583 --> 1:45:55.666
tear gas, the National Guard,
you're in sight of the convention center.

1:45:58.125 --> 1:45:59.416
[police radio chatter]

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.166
-Where we got trapped.
-What's another word for trapped?

1:46:06.250 --> 1:46:08.333
We were trapped
between the window and the police.

1:46:08.416 --> 1:46:09.750
What's another word for trapped?

1:46:12.208 --> 1:46:13.250
Caught, right?

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.875
Inside the bar,
it's like the '60s never happened.

1:46:19.958 --> 1:46:23.375
Outside the bar,
the '60s were being performed

1:46:23.458 --> 1:46:25.250
for anyone who looked out of the window.

1:46:26.041 --> 1:46:27.583
Anyone know what a buckeye is?

1:46:27.666 --> 1:46:28.916
-[man] Buckeye?
-Yeah.

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.375
[man] A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous nut.

1:46:31.458 --> 1:46:32.666
Hey.

1:46:33.333 --> 1:46:35.875
[woman on TV] 94 votes
for Vice President Humphrey.

1:46:35.958 --> 1:46:38.625
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on out there?

1:46:38.708 --> 1:46:42.166
And we see a cop do something
you don't ever wanna see a cop do.

1:46:47.875 --> 1:46:52.875
'60s outside the bar, '50s inside the bar.

1:46:53.583 --> 1:46:57.000
And then, an unnecessary metaphor.

1:46:57.083 --> 1:46:57.916
It's a nut.

1:46:58.708 --> 1:47:00.125
-What?
-A nut!

1:47:00.208 --> 1:47:02.541
[people scream]

1:47:02.625 --> 1:47:04.125
Were you resisting arrest?

1:47:04.208 --> 1:47:07.375
-They pushed us through the window!
-You overrun the riot police…

1:47:07.458 --> 1:47:08.958
Which is more than Rennie can say!

1:47:09.041 --> 1:47:13.041
Over 400 people admitted
to area hospitals with severe injuries!

1:47:13.125 --> 1:47:17.916
They had armored vehicles and bayonets!
They took off their name tags and badges!

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.416
We were trying to protest peacefully
at the fucking convention!

1:47:25.416 --> 1:47:27.416
-[grunts]
-[police radio chatter]

1:47:35.708 --> 1:47:37.375
[officer] Hands behind your back.

1:47:39.416 --> 1:47:40.458
Yeah.

1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.791
[Bill] Who started the riot, Tom?

1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:51.916
Our…

1:47:53.208 --> 1:47:54.125
What?

1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:57.000
Our…

1:47:58.500 --> 1:47:59.541
Our blood.

1:48:01.083 --> 1:48:03.708
[chuckles] "Our blood."

1:48:04.875 --> 1:48:06.791
"If our blood is gonna flow…"

1:48:07.916 --> 1:48:09.583
You meant to say,

1:48:10.541 --> 1:48:14.000
"If our blood is gonna flow,
then let it flow all over the city."

1:48:14.083 --> 1:48:15.500
You didn't mean the cops.

1:48:15.583 --> 1:48:19.125
You were saying, "If they're gonna
beat us up, everyone should see it."

1:48:24.541 --> 1:48:25.791
Jesus Christ!

1:48:25.875 --> 1:48:28.875
You do this…
He does this, it's a pattern.

1:48:28.958 --> 1:48:31.250
Read his portion
of the Port Huron Statement.

1:48:31.333 --> 1:48:36.250
He implies possessive pronouns
and uses vague noun modifiers.

1:48:38.333 --> 1:48:40.250
You read the Port Huron Statement?

1:48:40.333 --> 1:48:42.000
I've read everything you've published.

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:44.833
I didn't know that.

1:48:44.916 --> 1:48:46.333
You're a talented guy.

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.291
-Except for the possessive pronouns.
-I know.

1:48:49.375 --> 1:48:51.000
And the vague noun modifiers.

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.583
Put Abbie on the stand instead.

1:49:06.166 --> 1:49:09.000
[Hoffman] Would you state your full name
for the record, please?

1:49:09.583 --> 1:49:10.583
It's Abbie.

1:49:11.208 --> 1:49:12.208
[Hoffman] Last name.

1:49:12.833 --> 1:49:14.875
My grandfather's name was Shaboysnakoff,

1:49:14.958 --> 1:49:18.041
but he was a Russian Jew
protesting anti-Semitism,

1:49:18.125 --> 1:49:21.291
so he was assigned a name
that would sound like yours.

1:49:22.083 --> 1:49:23.875
What is your date of birth?

1:49:23.958 --> 1:49:26.375
Psychologically, 1960.

1:49:26.458 --> 1:49:29.250
[Hoffman] What were you doing until 1960?

1:49:29.333 --> 1:49:32.500
Nothing. I believe it's called
an American education.

1:49:32.583 --> 1:49:33.708
[spectators laugh]

1:49:33.791 --> 1:49:36.666
Why don't we just proceed
with the testimony?

1:49:36.750 --> 1:49:37.916
Sure.

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.875
Abbie, do you know
why you're on trial here?

1:49:42.166 --> 1:49:45.041
We carried certain ideas
across state lines.

1:49:46.208 --> 1:49:49.125
Not machine guns
or drugs or little girls.

1:49:49.208 --> 1:49:50.416
Ideas.

1:49:51.458 --> 1:49:54.166
When we crossed from New York
to New Jersey to Pennsylvania

1:49:54.250 --> 1:49:57.791
to Ohio to Illinois, we had certain ideas.

1:49:57.875 --> 1:49:59.208
And for that,

1:50:00.083 --> 1:50:03.375
we were gassed, beaten,
arrested and put on trial.

1:50:03.458 --> 1:50:04.333
Okay.

1:50:04.416 --> 1:50:09.208
In 1861, Lincoln said
in his inaugural address,

1:50:09.958 --> 1:50:12.708
"When the people shall grow weary
of their constitutional right

1:50:12.791 --> 1:50:13.958
to amend their government,

1:50:14.041 --> 1:50:16.625
they shall exert their revolutionary right

1:50:16.708 --> 1:50:20.666
to dismember and overthrow
that government."

1:50:21.583 --> 1:50:25.125
And if Lincoln had given that speech
in Lincoln Park last summer,

1:50:25.208 --> 1:50:27.416
he'd be put on trial with the rest of us.

1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:31.958
So how do you overthrow or dismember,
as you say, your government peacefully?

1:50:32.833 --> 1:50:35.208
In this country,
we do it every four years.

1:50:37.250 --> 1:50:38.291
That's all.

1:50:47.458 --> 1:50:53.083
[chuckles] So Chicago was just
a massive voter registration drive.

1:50:53.166 --> 1:50:55.916
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:50:56.500 --> 1:50:59.083
Did you hear the tape we played
of Tom Hayden?

1:50:59.166 --> 1:51:00.708
-Yes.
-You heard the tape?

1:51:00.791 --> 1:51:03.791
Did you hear Mr. Hayden
give an instruction to his people

1:51:03.875 --> 1:51:05.041
to take to the streets?

1:51:05.125 --> 1:51:09.333
"His people"?
Hayden's not a Mafia don and neither am I.

1:51:09.416 --> 1:51:10.500
Did you hear him say,

1:51:10.583 --> 1:51:13.875
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city"?

1:51:13.958 --> 1:51:17.291
[chuckles] The beginning of that sentence
was supposed to be…

1:51:18.791 --> 1:51:20.250
Yes. Yes, I did.

1:51:21.583 --> 1:51:22.625
What'd you think of that?

1:51:25.625 --> 1:51:28.958
I think Tom Hayden is a badass
of an American patriot.

1:51:30.916 --> 1:51:34.625
I didn't ask what you thought of the man,
I asked of his instruction of the crowd.

1:51:35.250 --> 1:51:38.291
I've also heard Tom Hayden say,
"Let's end the war,"

1:51:38.375 --> 1:51:40.250
but nobody stopped shooting.

1:51:40.916 --> 1:51:44.958
You can do anything to anything
by taking it out of context, Mr. Schultz.

1:51:45.041 --> 1:51:48.916
"If blood is gonna flow"?
How do you take that out of context?

1:51:49.958 --> 1:51:54.916
A guy once said, "I am come to set a man
at variance with his father

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.250
and the daughter against her mother."
You know who said it?

1:51:59.083 --> 1:52:00.041
Jerry Rubin.

1:52:00.125 --> 1:52:01.708
[chuckles] Yes.

1:52:02.375 --> 1:52:03.333
No.

1:52:03.875 --> 1:52:05.333
It was Jesus Christ.

1:52:05.416 --> 1:52:07.416
Matthew 10:35.

1:52:07.500 --> 1:52:11.000
And it sure sounds like
he's telling kids to kill their parents.

1:52:11.750 --> 1:52:15.083
Until you read Matthew 10:34 and 10:36.

1:52:15.958 --> 1:52:16.791
Do you have--

1:52:16.875 --> 1:52:19.791
He'd just seen his best friend
get hit in the head with a nightstick.

1:52:20.583 --> 1:52:23.708
The police, Mr. Schultz,
whose people are they?

1:52:24.291 --> 1:52:27.000
-Do you have contempt for your government?
-Do I--

1:52:27.083 --> 1:52:30.416
Yeah, do you have contempt
for your government?

1:52:31.750 --> 1:52:35.708
I think the institutions of our democracy
are wonderful things

1:52:35.791 --> 1:52:38.791
that right now are populated
by some terrible people.

1:52:38.875 --> 1:52:40.416
Please answer the question.

1:52:41.125 --> 1:52:42.250
Tell me again?

1:52:48.916 --> 1:52:50.625
Do you have contempt for your government?

1:52:51.250 --> 1:52:54.875
I'll tell you, it's nothing compared to
the contempt my government has for me.

1:52:54.958 --> 1:52:58.833
We've heard testimony
from 27 witnesses, under oath,

1:52:58.916 --> 1:53:02.750
that say you hoped
for a confrontation with the police,

1:53:02.833 --> 1:53:06.166
that your plans for the convention
were designed specifically

1:53:06.250 --> 1:53:08.666
to draw the police into a confrontation.

1:53:08.750 --> 1:53:11.625
If I'd known it was gonna be
the first wish of mine that came true,

1:53:11.708 --> 1:53:12.875
I would've aimed higher.

1:53:12.958 --> 1:53:15.000
It's a yes or no question.
When you came to Chicago,

1:53:15.083 --> 1:53:18.583
were you hoping for a confrontation
with the police?

1:53:29.833 --> 1:53:31.541
I'm concerned you have to think about it.

1:53:32.458 --> 1:53:34.125
Give me a moment, would you, friend?

1:53:34.750 --> 1:53:37.375
I've never been on trial
for my thoughts before.

1:54:04.958 --> 1:54:05.791
[door opens]

1:54:21.583 --> 1:54:23.375
[door opens]

1:54:23.458 --> 1:54:24.666
[bailiff] All rise.

1:54:26.708 --> 1:54:28.750
69 CR 180,

1:54:28.833 --> 1:54:32.166
United States of America
v. David Dellinger et al.

1:54:42.875 --> 1:54:46.458
The law requires that before sentencing,

1:54:46.541 --> 1:54:51.458
I allow the defendant or defendants
to make a statement to the court.

1:54:51.541 --> 1:54:56.458
I've advised defense counsel
that the court will allow one defendant

1:54:56.541 --> 1:54:59.791
to speak for the group,
and I've been advised

1:54:59.875 --> 1:55:01.791
the group has chosen Mr. Hayden.

1:55:01.875 --> 1:55:04.291
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

1:55:04.791 --> 1:55:08.875
Mr. Hayden, in spite of your actions
during the convention,

1:55:09.583 --> 1:55:13.125
you are the one defendant
who has shown, during this trial,

1:55:13.791 --> 1:55:17.875
respect for this court
and for this country,

1:55:17.958 --> 1:55:20.416
and remorse for those actions.

1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:23.291
I truly believe… And I mean this.

1:55:24.625 --> 1:55:30.791
I truly believe that one day you will be
a very productive part of our system.

1:55:31.666 --> 1:55:36.916
I'd like you to make your statement brief
and without political content of any kind.

1:55:37.625 --> 1:55:39.625
If you make your statement brief,

1:55:39.708 --> 1:55:44.375
if you make it respectful, if you make it
remorseful and to the point,

1:55:45.208 --> 1:55:49.166
I will look favorably upon that
when administering my sentence.

1:55:51.291 --> 1:55:53.208
Do you understand what I've just said?

1:55:55.291 --> 1:55:56.375
Mr. Hayden?

1:55:57.208 --> 1:55:58.125
[Tom] Yes, sir.

1:55:59.041 --> 1:56:01.958
-You'll look favorably in sentencing.
-Yes.

1:56:03.666 --> 1:56:07.083
If I make my statement
respectful and remorseful.

1:56:07.166 --> 1:56:08.000
Yes.

1:56:11.583 --> 1:56:13.833
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
what was the third one?

1:56:14.458 --> 1:56:15.375
Brief.

1:56:15.958 --> 1:56:16.833
Brief.

1:56:19.625 --> 1:56:22.958
If I do these things,
my government will look favorably on me.
