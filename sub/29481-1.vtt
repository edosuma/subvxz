38:41.362 --> 38:43.364
I have to set
the record straight.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.367
- About what?

38:46.411 --> 38:48.804
- Earlier today,
I went to Karim's apartment.

Have you ever been to Omaha,
Agent Zidan?

39:01.904 --> 39:03.036

39:04.472 --> 39:05.995

39:06.039 --> 39:09.825
It's a place where
well-intentioned agents

social workers go to die.

apartment to tip him off.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.763

Not yet, at least.

taken your advice.

have given you any.
