13:32.277 --> 13:34.377
could I train some fellas
to defend their homes?

Only the number of fellas
kept getting bigger and bigger

13:36.981 --> 13:39.649

anti-cure missiles on board.

29:22.366 --> 29:26.535
According to the
crew, that's the last of it.

29:26.537 --> 29:32.841
So... it is done.

29:32.843 --> 29:38.647
The rest of Asia won't suffer as we did.

29:39.917 --> 29:42.184
Let's get you home.

29:44.455 --> 29:47.723
I am home, Captain Chandler.

29:47.725 --> 29:49.725
[Exhales deeply]

29:49.727 --> 29:53.295
I want to remain
here... [Exhales deeply]

29:53.297 --> 29:56.165
On Japanese soil.

29:56.167 --> 29:57.800
[Exhales deeply]

30:03.207 --> 30:05.507
Takehaya.

30:05.509 --> 30:07.109
Kaito.

30:09.213 --> 30:11.346
My name is Kaito.

30:13.350 --> 30:16.151
Like my son.

30:38.576 --> 30:40.109
Captain...

31:03.734 --> 31:07.035
Fellow citizens of this great nation.

31:07.037 --> 31:10.272
I speak to you today from
an unforeseen point

31:10.274 --> 31:12.708
in human history.

31:12.710 --> 31:15.177
In all of their brilliance,

31:15.179 --> 31:18.413
our Founding Founders could
not have imagined a day

31:18.415 --> 31:20.716
when a single virus would wipe out

31:20.718 --> 31:26.221
90% of not just our
countrymen, but of our species.

31:28.359 --> 31:30.826
Here, take these. The speech's started.

31:30.828 --> 31:32.194
The President's speaking from the lawn.

31:32.196 --> 31:33.495
It's full of security guards out there.

31:33.497 --> 31:34.963
How are you guys going to get to him?

31:34.965 --> 31:37.499
He'll come to us.

31:37.501 --> 31:39.001
You ready?

31:39.003 --> 31:41.370
[Sighs] Yeah.

31:41.372 --> 31:44.072
Good.

31:44.074 --> 31:46.875
You two go with Barnes. Make
sure you keep him covered.

31:46.877 --> 31:48.177
You should get out of here.

31:48.179 --> 31:49.778
- What? No way.
- Dennis, I'm serious.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.947
Get as far away from here as possible.

31:51.949 --> 31:53.582
Good luck.

31:53.584 --> 31:54.850
Thank you.

31:54.852 --> 31:57.052
- For everything.
- [Door opens]

31:59.590 --> 32:02.291
Today, the idealism of democracy

32:02.293 --> 32:05.460
is at odds with the
practice of government

32:05.462 --> 32:08.463
for and by the people.

32:08.465 --> 32:15.070
Democracy, my fellow
Americans, is untenable.

32:15.072 --> 32:20.275
In short, the center cannot hold.

32:20.277 --> 32:23.111
It is therefore my
duty to inform you that,

32:23.113 --> 32:28.917
with the advice... and consent of the...

32:32.990 --> 32:35.858
regional leaders...

32:35.860 --> 32:41.330
today, we set a new
course for the country.

32:41.332 --> 32:46.335
In the absence of a...
legislative branch,

32:46.337 --> 32:50.439
and without an operational
central government,

32:50.441 --> 32:53.075
I have decided to
exercise my executive powers...

32:53.077 --> 32:55.377
Shame on you, Mr. President!

32:55.379 --> 32:56.879
[Murmuring]

32:56.881 --> 32:59.848
You don't have to do
this, sir. This isn't you.

32:59.850 --> 33:01.250
Get him out of here.

33:01.252 --> 33:03.352
The Howard Oliver that
we know saved St. Louis.

33:03.354 --> 33:06.421
Under your leadership, there
was no panic, no riots.

33:06.423 --> 33:08.957
Even when there were 5,000
people dying a day,

33:08.959 --> 33:11.026
you kept us together.

33:11.028 --> 33:12.728
What happened to that man, sir?!

33:12.730 --> 33:14.696
The President will not be
taking any questions today.

33:14.698 --> 33:16.064
Thank you very much.

33:16.066 --> 33:17.766
The hell I won't! Listen,
Jacob, you're right.

33:17.768 --> 33:20.402
For a moment, I forgot
who I was, but not anymore!

33:20.404 --> 33:21.937
- [Microphone feedback whines]
- I know who I am!

33:21.939 --> 33:23.438
Due to the security breach,

33:23.440 --> 33:25.107
I'm sorry, everyone, we
will reconvene tomorrow.

33:25.109 --> 33:26.875
Thank you for your
time. Thank you very much.

33:26.877 --> 33:28.343
Miss Shaw, where are they taking him?!

33:28.345 --> 33:30.445
Take your goddamn hands off me!

33:30.447 --> 33:33.348
[Gunshots, men grunting, casings clatter]

33:33.350 --> 33:35.918
Sir, it's me. It's Kara. I can help you.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.419
This way. You saved my life.

33:37.421 --> 33:38.820
Not yet, we haven't.

33:38.822 --> 33:40.289
Where are they taking him?!

33:40.291 --> 33:42.324
Is the President a
prisoner in the White House?!

33:42.326 --> 33:44.192
Miss Shaw!

33:44.194 --> 33:47.162
- Let's go, right now.
- [Crowd murmuring]

33:47.164 --> 33:48.463
- [Gunfire]
- Uhh!

33:48.465 --> 33:50.232
- [Screaming]
- We got a shooter!

33:50.234 --> 33:52.367
[Screaming continues]

33:53.971 --> 33:56.471
- [Gunfire]
- Uhh!

33:56.473 --> 33:58.240
Hot damn, son.

34:17.328 --> 34:18.994
- [Static]
- This is Allison Shaw.

34:18.996 --> 34:21.362
We have two shooters escaping
from the East Wing with POTUS.

34:21.364 --> 34:26.068
[Gunfire, crowd screaming]

34:26.070 --> 34:28.670
[Grunting]

34:28.672 --> 34:30.072
We got to go back for Jacob.

34:30.074 --> 34:31.907
Let me go! Let me go!

34:31.909 --> 34:34.208
You run back in there,
you don't come back! Jac...

34:34.210 --> 34:35.844
It's about the President.

34:35.846 --> 34:37.946
- [Gunfire]
- Uhh!

34:37.947 --> 34:39.614
[Screaming and gunfire continue]

34:39.616 --> 34:42.250
- Uhh!
- [Gunshots]

34:42.252 --> 34:43.952
[Engine revs, tires screech]

34:43.954 --> 34:45.487
Go!

34:45.489 --> 34:47.723
[Gunshots]

34:47.725 --> 34:49.257
Let go of me!

34:49.259 --> 34:50.826
Don't let the vehicle get out!

34:50.828 --> 34:52.060
- [Gunfire]
- [Grunts]

34:52.062 --> 34:54.795
Lock the gates! Move!

34:54.797 --> 34:58.867
Drive, Kara, drive!

34:58.869 --> 35:00.902
[Tires screech]

35:00.904 --> 35:03.672
[Panting]

35:03.674 --> 35:07.109
[Tires screeching]

35:49.745 --> 35:51.945
Thought I'd be the one to tell you.

35:51.947 --> 35:55.348
The Cobra Team found
coordinates of Henan CIC.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.050
You were right.

35:57.052 --> 35:59.486
The Chinese knew where
Hayward and Shackleton were gonna be.

35:59.488 --> 36:00.820
Seems someone in St. Louis

36:00.822 --> 36:03.957
wants the U.S. Navy out
of the way, Captain.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.993
There's still some
good people back home.

36:06.995 --> 36:09.462
Generals, captains, operators.

36:09.464 --> 36:11.097
I know a few myself.

36:11.099 --> 36:12.632
Well, let's get 'em on the line.

36:12.634 --> 36:15.135
We need all the help we can muster.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.775
- [Speaking Japanese]
- [Baby whimpers]

36:21.777 --> 36:25.679
[Continues speaking in Japanese]

36:25.681 --> 36:27.247
Captain...

36:27.249 --> 36:30.283
[Speaking Japanese]

36:32.954 --> 36:35.088
Kyoko wants to thank
you for all that you've done

36:35.090 --> 36:38.758
for her family and for
Japan. She wishes you well.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.694
Man: You gonna unhook this vest?

36:40.696 --> 36:42.462
[Speaks Japanese]

36:42.464 --> 36:44.397
[Baby cries]

36:44.399 --> 36:46.933
[Crew speaking indistinctly]

36:48.937 --> 36:52.305
She wants to die with her
husband on her own soil.

36:52.307 --> 36:55.775
Her people will take care of the baby.

36:55.777 --> 36:59.579
I'm fueled up and ready
to go. Jesse, thank you.

36:59.581 --> 37:02.382
You saved a lot of lives. You're
gonna save a lot more.

37:02.384 --> 37:05.685
Just get home in one piece.

37:05.687 --> 37:07.253
Take care of yourself.

37:08.357 --> 37:10.123
Man: I'll have the
final numbers ASAP, sir.

37:10.125 --> 37:13.827
Man: No, he's on the hangar deck.

37:13.829 --> 37:16.730
Woman: I'll find him. Stand by.

37:16.732 --> 37:20.133
Man: Is that the last
of it off the RHIB?

37:20.135 --> 37:22.969
- Careful with that.
- Man: Aye, sir. I'm on it.

37:25.507 --> 37:27.140
<i>This is NOMAD.</i>

37:27.142 --> 37:30.610
<i>All set to deliver the cure to Asia.</i>

37:30.612 --> 37:33.346
<i>So long, Mother.</i>

37:40.589 --> 37:42.021
Naval Station San Diego.

37:42.023 --> 37:46.292
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.

37:46.294 --> 37:48.561
I say again, Naval Station San Diego.

37:48.563 --> 37:51.398
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.933
Sir, there's something you need to see.

37:53.935 --> 37:56.403
<i>Terror grips our nation this day.</i>

37:56.405 --> 37:59.072
<i>The strains of
reconstruction have proven too great to bear</i>

37:59.074 --> 38:03.243
<i>and have given rise to forces hellbent
on creating chaos. [ Door closes ]</i>

38:03.245 --> 38:05.245
<i>In front of live television cameras,</i>

38:05.247 --> 38:07.680
<i>agitators breached our
walls and tried to take control</i>

38:07.682 --> 38:09.382
<i>of this nation's capital.</i>

38:09.384 --> 38:12.018
<i>This was not their first attempt.</i>

38:12.020 --> 38:13.720
<i>Until today, the regional leaders and I</i>

38:13.722 --> 38:16.222
<i>have guarded the truth for
the safety of the public.</i>

38:16.224 --> 38:20.193
<i>Now it's time you, the
American people, learn the facts.</i>

38:20.195 --> 38:24.030
<i>President Jeffery Michener
did not take his own life.</i>

38:24.032 --> 38:27.400
<i>He was murdered, along
with Senator Beatty</i>

38:27.402 --> 38:30.370
<i>and Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, Rivera.</i>

38:30.372 --> 38:33.072
<i>The terrorist were working
with certain members of the media</i>

38:33.074 --> 38:35.809
<i>and with agents
inside the government itself,</i>

38:35.811 --> 38:39.712
<i>but until today, we didn't
know how high it went.</i>

38:39.714 --> 38:41.181
<i>It is my duty to inform you</i>

38:41.183 --> 38:43.349
<i>that the leader of this radical group</i>

38:43.351 --> 38:46.653
<i>was President Howard Oliver himself.</i>

38:46.655 --> 38:49.122
<i>He orchestrated the
deaths of Jeffrey Michener</i>

38:49.124 --> 38:52.659
<i>and those loyal to him so
that he could take office</i>

38:52.661 --> 38:55.061
<i>and create a dictatorship.</i>

38:55.063 --> 38:57.363
Son of a bitch.

38:58.700 --> 39:01.401
[Panting]

39:01.403 --> 39:04.037
[Gun cocks]

39:04.039 --> 39:07.340
Don't do this. Don't do this.

39:07.342 --> 39:10.677
- Please, don't do this! Don't do...
- [Gunshot]

39:10.679 --> 39:12.245
But that is not all.

39:12.247 --> 39:14.714
We have just learned that this
cabal was also responsible

39:14.716 --> 39:18.785
for the kidnapping of the
crew of Nathan James in Asia.

39:18.787 --> 39:20.186
This was done with the cooperation

39:20.188 --> 39:23.122
and planning of Captain Tom Chandler.

39:23.124 --> 39:25.692
In fact, I struggle
to believe it's true.

39:25.694 --> 39:29.162
But we have indisputable
evidence of his treachery.

39:29.164 --> 39:31.130
Captain Chandler is
currently under arrest

39:31.132 --> 39:35.068
and is heading back to North America.

39:35.070 --> 39:38.938
[Voice breaking] These are
not easy words for me to say.

39:38.940 --> 39:42.208
Oh, my God. She's
putting all this on you.

39:42.210 --> 39:44.244
- <i>Excuse me. My apologies.</i>
- Nobody'll buy it.

39:44.246 --> 39:46.579
The greater the lie, the
more people will believe it.

39:46.581 --> 39:49.516
<i>We are strong people, and we
have survived worse than this.</i>

39:49.518 --> 39:51.618
<i>And those who still love life, liberty,</i>

39:51.620 --> 39:53.653
<i>and the pursuit of
happiness have come together</i>

39:53.655 --> 39:56.389
<i>and formulated a plan to move forward.</i>

39:56.391 --> 39:59.859
<i>So in the absence of any working
federal government,</i>

39:59.861 --> 40:01.661
<i>and deriving their just powers</i>

40:01.663 --> 40:03.730
<i>from the consent of the governed,</i>

40:03.732 --> 40:06.733
<i>your regional leaders,
Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft</i>

40:06.735 --> 40:08.735
<i>hereby call for the immediate suspension</i>

40:08.737 --> 40:12.305
<i>of the government of the United States.</i>

40:12.307 --> 40:14.307
<i>Each region will be
able to govern itself</i>

40:14.309 --> 40:16.009
<i>and focus on reconstruction</i>

40:16.011 --> 40:17.877
<i>until such time as a central authority</i>

40:17.879 --> 40:19.412
<i>can be safely reestablished.</i>

40:19.867 --> 40:21.967
Yeah. In other words, never.

40:21.969 --> 40:23.869
<i>By the time you hear these words,</i>

40:23.871 --> 40:25.571
<i>control of the Armed
Forces will have been split</i>

40:25.573 --> 40:27.740
<i>among the regional leaders,</i>

40:27.742 --> 40:29.375
<i>and I would like to assure you...</i>

40:29.377 --> 40:31.543
<i>that the military
turnover has been peaceful,</i>

40:31.545 --> 40:34.513
<i>thanks to an unprecedented collaboration</i>

40:34.515 --> 40:36.849
<i>between the nation's highest-ranking
generals</i>

40:36.851 --> 40:39.518
<i>and your four regional leaders. Aah!</i>

40:39.520 --> 40:41.653
<i>All enlisted men and
women are to report to</i>

40:41.655 --> 40:44.023
<i>regional military offices
immediately to become part...</i>

40:44.025 --> 40:46.692
<i>Of one of four localized
armies under the command...</i>

40:46.694 --> 40:49.294
Captain, I can't get the
generals on the line...

40:49.296 --> 40:51.030
Any of them.

40:51.032 --> 40:54.733
I tried to raise an entire Naval base.

40:54.735 --> 40:56.435
It's a coup, Captain.

40:56.437 --> 40:58.670
<i>Thank you and God bless.</i>

40:58.672 --> 41:01.273
Those men are already dead.

41:01.275 --> 41:05.044
If there's no military, what
does that mean for us?

41:06.680 --> 41:09.014
It means we're all alone.

41:11.752 --> 41:14.086
We lost our country, Tom.

41:17.091 --> 41:19.491
Not yet.

41:19.493 --> 41:24.062
Captain, set a course for
Naval Base San Diego, helpful.

41:25.833 --> 41:27.408
Take us home.
