00:03.655 --> 00:04.004
.

00:04.047 --> 00:06.223
- I came in with this patient.
I'd like to see it through.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.398
- I got a team.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.573
Thanks.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.140
- Hey, April,
you saved his life.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.707
You're pretty good for a nurse.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.448
Should've gone to med school.

00:13.491 --> 00:14.753
- We have to stick
with the playbook.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.190
- Or we try something else.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.756
- We have
something better in mind.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.323
- How do we sit here
and not even try?

00:19.367 --> 00:20.803
- I'm with you.
- Charged. Clear.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.370
- Okay, let's give it a minute.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.199
- Going behind my back,
throwing up Hail Marys?

00:25.242 --> 00:27.114
You and I have a problem.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.246
- Dr. Marcel?
I've got this new device.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.467
- Promoting your products
for unapproved uses?

00:32.510 --> 00:33.642
- They could've worked.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.860
- This is far beyond the bounds

00:34.904 --> 00:37.515
of professional conduct.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.083
- I started seeing someone new.
Dr. Marcel.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
- You haven't introduced him
to Owen yet, have you?

00:42.390 --> 00:44.392
- Where is all this
coming from?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.090
- It was pitch-black.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
I couldn't see my hand
in front of my face.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.529
So here I am, moving slowly,

00:51.573 --> 00:53.705
cautious,

00:53.749 --> 00:57.144
skimming my flashlight
across the water,

00:57.187 --> 00:58.493
when there he is.

00:58.536 --> 01:01.409
- You do remember that
I have a heart condition?

01:01.452 --> 01:03.846
- Oh, in that moment,
I did too.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.195
He was big.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.589
Terrifying big, right?

01:07.632 --> 01:08.807
But I was gonna get him.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.114
- Oh, dear me.
You went in closer.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.551
- Oh, I had to.
All or nothing.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.205
So I eased in,

01:15.249 --> 01:18.121
lined him up.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.253
Then, pop!

01:19.296 --> 01:21.168
Got him.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.343
Look at this.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
- Oh, wow!
- Look at that.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.523
- No, it's like
he's right there.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.568
- Right?
- Yeah. Wow.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.743
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31.787 --> 01:32.875
- Owen tucked in?
- Yes.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.704
Fell asleep before
the door got closed.

01:35.747 --> 01:36.835
What'd I miss?

01:36.879 --> 01:39.142
- I asked Crockett
about his hobbies,

01:39.186 --> 01:41.362
and he said photography.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.320
- Yes, I think we were
about, what, five minutes

01:43.364 --> 01:45.409
into our first dinner
before he pulled that story out

01:45.453 --> 01:46.889
and showed me the picture.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.761
Yeah, I think it was his move
to try and impress me.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.329
Mm-hmm.
- Busted.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.809
But here we are,

01:53.852 --> 01:55.724
many dinners later.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.942
Mission accomplished.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.770
- [chuckles]

01:58.814 --> 02:01.425
So Crockett?
- Mm-hmm?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.471
- I know that you are a surgeon

02:03.514 --> 02:06.256
and have an eye for reptiles.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.431
What else?

02:07.475 --> 02:08.563
Any siblings?

02:08.606 --> 02:09.825
- Yeah, a younger sister.
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.218
- Lives in Baton Rouge.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.697
- And your parents?

02:12.741 --> 02:15.483
Yeah, Natalie tells me
that they emigrated from Iran.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.964
So does that mean
that your family is Muslim?

02:19.008 --> 02:22.229
- No, we're actually
Zoroastrian.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.621
- "Zoroastrian"?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.449
I'm sorry. I--

02:25.493 --> 02:27.495
- Yeah, it dates back
to ancient Persia.

02:27.538 --> 02:28.931
The three main pillars:

02:28.974 --> 02:30.672
good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.761
- Hmm.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.589
- Not always so easy.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.808
- Hmm.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.593
That's very interesting.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.203
- Yeah.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.900
- I had no idea.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.425
- Does anyone want some coffee?
- Yeah, I'll take some.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.209
- Okay. Mom, tea?
- Yes, sweetheart.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.341
Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.169
I will be right back.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.829
- Hey. Nice.
Is that a new suit?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.309
- You want to tell me
what's going on?

02:59.353 --> 03:01.006
Just got the new
pharma rep rules.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.834
Resterilization
of proprietary equipment,

03:02.878 --> 03:04.314
in-house device review.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.315
Lots of red tape.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.969
- Well, it's just
some adjustments

03:07.012 --> 03:09.450
so all the reps
are on the same page.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.713
We need to make sure
no one's overstepping.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.845
- This is about Dr. Marcel
and me last week, isn't it?

03:13.889 --> 03:16.283
- Indirectly, Michael, yes.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.588
- Ma, I am not
the only red hat

03:17.632 --> 03:18.937
who's pitched a device
off-label.

03:18.981 --> 03:19.982
- I'm aware of that.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.418
- Then why does this feel
personal?

03:21.462 --> 03:22.767
- This wasn't intentional.

03:22.811 --> 03:26.336
The updates are solely
to protect the hospital.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.990
- It sounds like
the company line.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.861
- Michael--

03:29.905 --> 03:30.906
Michael.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
- Uh-oh.
- Michael and I.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.347
It's been rocky
the last few weeks.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.697
- Parenthood.
Life sentence, right?

03:39.741 --> 03:41.569
- Oh, you're telling me.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.006
- Want to grab coffee?
- Oh, I don't have time.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.008
Maybe later?
- Yeah.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.053
- Five courses?
- Yeah.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.925
Website says it'll send
all the ingredients.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.709
We just prepare it.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.276
- Okay. I'm in.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.582
This weekend?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.018
- I know.
I know I'm late.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.063
By 33 seconds.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.065
- Was just gonna say
good morning.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.633
But I guess you are late.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.896
- Meet up for lunch?
- Sounds good.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.859
Still waiting to hear back on
that invitation to play chess.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.600
Beginning to think
that you're dodging me.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.863
- No. Long day.
It's the time my shift ends.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.039
Don't have the brain power.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.302
Maybe play Will.
- Tried.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.521
It didn't go well.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.784
He's a checkers guy.
- [chuckles]

04:22.827 --> 04:25.482
- Anyway, offer's out there.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.660
- Dr. Choi, incoming.
Treatment 3.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.053
[siren]

04:31.096 --> 04:33.360
- Courtney?

04:33.403 --> 04:36.363
- Montez Price, 21.
Pro tennis player.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.452
Hitting partner accidentally
drilled him in the chest

04:38.495 --> 04:39.844
with a tennis ball.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.933
Trainer said he was
unresponsive and pulseless.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.327
Grabbed an AED,
and shocked him once.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.895
When we got there, he was awake
and in sinus rhythm.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.984
Tested negative for COVID
in the ambo.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.725
- Let's get ready to transfer,
huh?

04:52.727 --> 04:53.858
Everybody ready?

04:53.902 --> 04:55.469
One, two, three.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.690
- Okay. Vitals stable.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.127
BP 120/82.
Heart rate's 78.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.086
- Heart is good.
Regular rate and rhythm.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.827
Let's get a CBC, BMP,
cardiac labs,

05:05.870 --> 05:07.655
12-lead EKG, and a chest X-ray.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.961
Hey, Montez. I'm Dr. Choi.
Can you hear me?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.572
- My chest hurts.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.791
Did I have a heart attack?
- No.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.402
Your rhythm on monitor
looks good.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.926
It was likely an episode of
what's called commotio cordis.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.494
The blow from the ball
disrupted your heart rhythm,

05:20.537 --> 05:21.886
caused it to stop beating.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.627
- But it's all better now?
- Yeah.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.629
The impact caused it.
It's not your heart.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.457
- [strained]
But it still feels...

05:27.501 --> 05:28.806
funny.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.634
- Funny? Funny, how?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.157
Hey, Montez. Montez!
[monitor beeping]

05:32.201 --> 05:35.465
- BP's dropping. 72/40.
Heart rate's spiking. 180.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.771
- He's in narrow
complex v-tach.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.338
Connect the pads to cardiovert.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.342
- Synced.
- Clear. Hit it.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.042
- BP's back up.
120/70.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.739
But heart rate's still high.
110.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.655
- Bolus 150 milligrams of amio
and hang a drip.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.527
Before, his heart
wasn't beating at all.

05:53.570 --> 05:57.052
Now it's beating too fast?
- What's going on?

05:57.095 --> 05:58.140
- [sighs]

05:58.183 --> 06:01.143
[tense music]

06:01.186 --> 06:05.365
â™ª

06:09.325 --> 06:09.499
.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.327
- Maybe you should
check her chart first

06:11.371 --> 06:12.459
before you waste my time

06:12.502 --> 06:14.374
with this dumb question.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.203
- Morning, Dr. Lanik.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.423
Maggie said you requested me
for the COVID ICU.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.599
- Yeah, one less person
for me to micromanage.

06:22.643 --> 06:25.167
- Almost sounds like
a compliment.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.995
Anyway, thanks.
I've really missed--

06:27.038 --> 06:29.389
- Yeah, sure.
You good to go?

06:29.432 --> 06:30.912
- Always.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.349
- Counting on you.
Go suit up.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.091
- Dr. Halstead,
you're going to Baghdad.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.179
- Yeah.
- Liam McIntyre.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.181
65-year-old male.
COVID negative.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.312
GCS 15.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.011
BP 100/70.
Rate 120.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.447
Suspected left shoulder
dislocation.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.448
- [groans]
- Okay.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.928
Mr. McIntyre?
I'm Dr. Halstead.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.060
You know where you are?
- Hospital?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.367
- All right.
Let's get ready to transfer.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.934
- On my count.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.588
One, two, three.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.460
- Thank you.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.550
- [panting weakly]

07:00.594 --> 07:02.334
- Diminished breath sounds.
Left side.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.946
- Kathleen,
we're gonna need an X-ray.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.296
- Any pain where I touch?
- No.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.906
- Okay, chin up.
Down.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.430
Left, right.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.344
Any pain?

07:12.388 --> 07:14.042
Good. C-spine's clear.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.396
[eerie music]

07:20.440 --> 07:22.529
Mr. McIntyre?

07:22.572 --> 07:25.096
Liam, you with me?

07:25.140 --> 07:26.228
- I'm fine.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.186
I'm just a little rattled.

07:28.230 --> 07:31.189
- X-ray's up.
Everybody get back.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.627
- Have a small amount of fluid.
Left chest.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.237
Left shoulder dislocated.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.065
50 fentanyl, 2 of versed.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.284
Maggie, countertraction.
- Yep.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.243
All right, Mr. McIntyre.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.549
We're gonna put this
around your arm.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.941
- Okay.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.160
- This is gonna hurt.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.292
I'ma need you to breathe, okay?
- Okay.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.598
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.036
[shoulder pops]
- Ah!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.385
- All right.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.213
Yep, all done.
Shoulder's in.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.041
- So sorry.
- You're good, Liam.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.434
You just rest for now.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.566
Okay?
- Thanks.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.570
- Draw up trauma labs.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.181
- Yeah.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.748
But did you catch
how he keeps on

08:07.791 --> 08:09.271
looking at the corner
of the room?

08:09.314 --> 08:10.402
- Yeah, it's weird.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.535
No evidence of head trauma,
though.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.581
- He's doing it again.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.974
- Remember our trip to Tahoe?

08:17.018 --> 08:18.236
I was in a cast for weeks.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.542
- But there's
no one else there.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.587
- Do me a favor.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.110
- Yeah, I'll contact
Dr. Charles.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.241
- Mm-hmm.
- Done.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.071
- Thanks.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.423
I wanted to apologize
about last night.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.599
My mom--
- No.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.296
No apology necessary.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.863
Look, I grew up
in the Bible Belt.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.561
You're either Catholic,
Methodist, or Southern Baptist.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.476
Not...different, you know?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.999
So I'm used to it.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.566
- Nat, Crockett,
patient in treatment 4.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.220
Her name is Lisa Holtzman.
- Thanks, Mags.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.264
- Okay.
- All right.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.657
- [whimpering]

08:47.701 --> 08:49.311
- Hi, Lisa.
I'm Dr. Manning.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.747
This is Dr. Marcel.
- Hi.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.401
- Belly...radiating.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.229
- "Radiating"?
Not a lay term.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.491
You a doctor?
- No.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.232
Professional patient.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.234
- You mind if I lift your gown?

08:59.277 --> 09:00.670
Okay.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.325
- Those scars on your abdomen,
laparoscopic ports?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.631
- Appendix, gall bladder,
all gone.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
- Okay. I'm gonna...

09:06.110 --> 09:08.243
- [groans]

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
- Fullness in the pelvis.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.333
All right, we're gonna
do an ultrasound, okay?

09:11.376 --> 09:12.421
- Okay.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.252
- Can't see anything.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.601
Bladder's huge and in the way.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.516
Lisa, when's the last time
you urinated?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.691
- I don't know.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.345
Yesterday, I think?

09:23.388 --> 09:25.565
- Well, pain could be coming
from urinary retention.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.262
Foley?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.481
We're gonna drain your bladder.
It should help ease the pain.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.613
Okay?
- Okay.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.354
- And get you some med too,
all right?

09:32.397 --> 09:35.357
- My bag.
Grab what's inside.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.495
What is all this?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.497
- My medical records.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.852
- Hey, Montez.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.375
How are you feeling?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.681
- Exhausted.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.292
And then there's all this...

09:57.335 --> 09:59.511
- Your heart's still
beating irregularly.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.731
Too fast--I'm trying to get
a read on why.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.733
Your vitals are fine.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.866
EKG and echo were both normal.

10:05.909 --> 10:09.391
- So you're saying I'm healthy?
- No.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.872
The chart is, but it's wrong.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.656
The heart of
a 21-year-old pro athlete

10:13.700 --> 10:15.658
should not spontaneously
go into A-fib.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.619
- This can't be it.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.751
I'm too close.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.579
My father loved tennis.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.581
I was maybe four.
He tossed me balls.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.714
Pretended it was the U.S. Open.

10:27.757 --> 10:31.456
He'd say, "One day, Montez.
Arthur Ashe Stadium."

10:33.633 --> 10:37.158
He died when I was seven.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.681
I've been training for the Open
ever since,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.552
and now, I'm inches away.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.297
I need to play
in that tournament.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.647
- I'll keep looking,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.518
figure this out.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.521
- Seriously?
Damn it!

10:52.564 --> 10:54.479
- Put pressure.
Lean your head forward.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.700
Ice pack.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.528
- I got it. I got it.
It happens when I'm stressed.

10:59.571 --> 11:00.660
It'll stop.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.581
- What the hell, Sharon?
- Ms. Goodwin, I'm so sorry.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.367
- That's all right, Cheryl.
I always have time for our COO.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.934
- Well, my phone
has been ringing

11:13.977 --> 11:16.719
off the hook this morning.
Angry reps.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.330
Your unilateral changes
to our red hat protocols--

11:19.374 --> 11:20.723
they're trouble.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.594
- I have to do what's best
for the hospital, Gwen,

11:22.638 --> 11:25.685
which means reducing
liabilities wherever they are.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.904
- Our relationship
with pharma and biotech,

11:27.948 --> 11:29.471
they help keep the lights on.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.647
If Med is suddenly difficult
to work with,

11:31.691 --> 11:32.866
they move to East Mercy.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.389
We lose funding.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.826
- This is our house.
They can play by our rules.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.481
- Not these.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.830
I'm shutting them down.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.667
.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.450
- Three.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.278
- Good.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.933
Mind me asking where
you were headed this morning

11:56.977 --> 12:00.371
when you had your accident?
- Nowhere really.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.938
Four.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.940
- Right.
Just out running errands?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.377
- Just driving.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.292
Was cooped up for over a year.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
But now that
I'm finally vaccinated,

12:09.816 --> 12:12.209
I'll take any excuse I can
to leave the house.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.820
- I hear that.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.257
I mean, whoever thought we'd
actually be looking forward

12:16.300 --> 12:18.433
to picking up our dry cleaning,
right?

12:18.476 --> 12:20.217
No fingers yet?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.958
- Now, I see it. Two.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.352
- Okay. Okay, good.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.877
So, Liam, tell me, uh,

12:27.921 --> 12:30.053
what's in the corner?

12:30.097 --> 12:32.969
- What?
No one.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.797
- Wait, is it a person?

12:38.845 --> 12:40.716
- It's my wife.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
Terri.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.502
- Okay.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.418
- She died
three weeks into lockdown.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.072
Aneurysm.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
- Very sorry to hear that.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.469
- We were actually looking
forward to being quarantined.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.080
Cook all those recipes
we never had time for.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.517
Then she was just...

12:59.561 --> 13:01.868
gone.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.348
Look.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.525
I know she'd dead,

13:07.569 --> 13:10.354
but I swear, she's--

13:10.398 --> 13:12.052
she's right there.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.444
- You know what?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.359
I believe you.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.884
Tell me, how long roughly

13:17.927 --> 13:21.365
have you been seeing her?

13:21.409 --> 13:24.847
- A few months.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.372
I know my mind is
playing tricks on me,

13:28.416 --> 13:30.200
but I don't care.

13:30.244 --> 13:33.247
Losing Terri was devastating,

13:33.290 --> 13:35.858
so having her back,

13:35.902 --> 13:39.122
even like this, it's...

13:39.166 --> 13:41.777
salvation.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.040
- You know, I, um--

13:44.084 --> 13:47.043
I actually lost my wife
not that long ago,

13:47.087 --> 13:51.004
so trust me, I get it.

13:51.047 --> 13:55.051
Look, I'm going to have
a quick chat with Dr. Halstead,

13:55.095 --> 13:57.445
and then, I will--
I'll be back.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.229
All right?
- Okay.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.232
[soft dramatic music]

14:02.276 --> 14:05.061
â™ª

14:05.105 --> 14:06.889
- So what do you think?
Dementia?

14:06.933 --> 14:10.545
- No. You know, he's lucid.
He's oriented.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.243
His peripheral vision
is virtually nonexistent

14:13.287 --> 14:15.071
on the right side in both eyes,
all right?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.856
And that blind spot is exactly

14:16.899 --> 14:18.422
where he's seeing
his dead wife.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.076
- So she's
a visual hallucination.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.382
- Right, and I think
we're looking at

14:21.425 --> 14:22.600
Charles Bonnet Syndrome, right?

14:22.644 --> 14:25.342
Where the brain responds
to vision loss

14:25.386 --> 14:26.996
by filling in the blanks.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.302
But here's the thing.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.912
I'm not seeing any evidence
of, you know,

14:29.956 --> 14:32.262
standard signs of vision loss,
which makes me think

14:32.306 --> 14:33.785
that we're--I don't know.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.831
We might be looking at some
deeper brain or eye issue.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.268
- I'll order an MRI.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.357
- Thank you.
- Yep.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.272
- Lisa, hi.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.318
So we got your initial
lab results back,

14:44.361 --> 14:47.060
and it was normal
all across the board.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.453
- [sighs]

14:49.497 --> 14:52.065
- I'm sorry.
Normal is usually good news.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.893
- I let myself get my hopes up.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.633
I shouldn't have done that.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.462
Volume seven of my 16-year war

14:58.506 --> 15:00.595
with abdominal pain.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.119
All I know, it's not IBS.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.468
Or endometriosis.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.514
Or interstitial cystitis.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.951
Kidney stones, pancreatitis,

15:08.995 --> 15:11.301
bowel obstruction.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.435
It hurts the worst right here.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.133
There has to be a reason.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.962
But I have been poked, prodded,

15:20.006 --> 15:22.182
scanned, cut open,

15:22.225 --> 15:24.445
and no one ever finds anything!

15:24.488 --> 15:26.882
- Lisa, I can't even imagine
your frustration--

15:26.926 --> 15:28.492
- But I don't need sympathy.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.364
I need you to fix me.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.540
- We'll do our best.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.369
Unfortunately,
that does require more pokes,

15:35.412 --> 15:39.155
prods, X-rays, scans.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.070
- Have at it.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.290
- Okay.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.688
- Hi. Ms. Caine?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.429
I'm April.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.909
What happened to your cannula?

15:53.953 --> 15:57.130
- Pulled it out.
Who knows what's really in it?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.262
And you don't need
the space suit.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.916
- Hmm, one day.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.092
But for now, it's a precaution
we take in the COVID ICU.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.529
- I don't have coronavirus.
- No?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.401
- It's not real.
Big scam.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.185
[coughing]
- Okay.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.274
But I can see you're
having trouble breathing.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.408
- It's just the flu.
Get it every year.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.019
- Well, flu or not,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.021
a little extra oxygen

16:19.065 --> 16:21.371
might help you feel
more comfortable.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.546
What do you say?

16:22.590 --> 16:25.158
Want to give the cannula
another shot?

16:25.201 --> 16:27.377
- [weakly]
Fine.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.422
- Okay.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.042
- I saw him play
a couple months ago.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.261
On TV, that is.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.958
- You're a tennis fan?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.047
- I was that night.
Couldn't sleep.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.963
His match was the only show
that was on at 2:00 a.m.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.356
Hell of a player.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.010
Is he gonna be okay?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.054
- I'm not sure.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.230
A-fib problem.
Don't know why.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.753
- Well, I'm a cardiologist.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.625
Can I help?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.195
- Thanks, but technically,
you're limited

17:02.238 --> 17:05.111
to seeing patients who are part
of your clinical trial.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.460
- Totally understand.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.247
- I cauterized
the active bleeders.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.207
Should help stem the tide.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.166
Kid keeps asking me
if his career is over.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.125
I didn't know what to say.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.996
- Neither do I.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.084
- Thanks.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.658
- Dr. Virani.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.443
I reconsidered.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
I'll send you the chart.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.409
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.671
- What's this?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.673
- That is a Persian spice set.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.631
Gift from your mom.
- Oh.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.329
- Even comes with a, uh--

17:49.372 --> 17:51.157
an array of popular recipes.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.333
- Oh, this is awkward.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.117
- I'm Iranian.
We love to cook.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.293
It's a wonderful gift.
Thoughtful.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.513
Never got a gesture like that
from my ex in-laws.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.210
- What do you mean?

18:01.254 --> 18:03.343
- You know, a Persian
Zoroastrian son-in-law

18:03.386 --> 18:06.041
is not what they had in mind
for their southern belle.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.608
- I mean, from the little
I know about Claire,

18:07.651 --> 18:09.653
you two seem pretty different,
so...

18:09.697 --> 18:11.307
- Opposites attract, I guess.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.570
Didn't keep us together,
though.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.225
Uh, is that Lisa's
latest test results?

18:16.269 --> 18:18.445
- Yes. The labs are all normal.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.664
Same with the KUB
and trans-vaginal ultrasound.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.710
Next up is a CT.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.669
- I'll squeeze that
into my locker.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.149
I'll meet you upstairs.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.761
- Sharon.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.763
You know the E.D.'s hurting
for staffing.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.244
But same time,
with the pandemic,

18:35.288 --> 18:37.638
nursing and med school
enrollments have surged.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.683
- A silver lining.
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.686
I was thinking we expand
the E.D. training programs

18:42.730 --> 18:44.514
to match demand.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.863
Puts Med on the map,

18:45.907 --> 18:47.865
and we get helping hands.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.693
Win-win.
- I like it.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.347
Write a proposal.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.175
- All right!

18:53.219 --> 18:54.568
What's up?

18:54.611 --> 18:57.353
- I updated Med's protocols
for the pharma reps,

18:57.397 --> 19:00.878
and Gwen's undoing them,
playing hero in the process.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.143
And now,
all the reps owe her one.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.146
No doubt she'll enjoy
using that against me.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.588
My smile convincing enough?

19:14.631 --> 19:18.244
- Very professional.
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.246
[monitor beeping]

19:20.289 --> 19:23.249
- Grand mal seizure.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.467
Five of Ativan.
- Yeah.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.350
- Mr. McIntyre?

19:37.393 --> 19:39.743
You just had a seizure.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.441
- Terri?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.225
[whimpers]
Terri?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.531
Terri, where are you?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.446
Terri?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.317
Oh! Oh, there you are.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.319
Oh, there you are.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.799
[panting]

19:51.842 --> 19:53.148
Thank God.

20:00.938 --> 20:01.112
.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.375
- A tumor?

20:02.418 --> 20:03.767
- In your brain's
vision center.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
The left occipital lobe.
It caused your seizure.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.771
And it's safe to assume

20:07.815 --> 20:10.252
an earlier one led
to your car accident.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.254
- Vision center?

20:12.298 --> 20:13.603
That's also why--

20:13.647 --> 20:15.039
- That's right.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.738
The tumor created a blind spot,
right?

20:17.781 --> 20:20.393
And in order to make sense
of that void,

20:20.436 --> 20:22.264
your brain has been
filling it in

20:22.308 --> 20:24.223
with images of your wife.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.703
- Now, Liam, I know a brain
tumor can sound overwhelming,

20:26.747 --> 20:28.879
but yours is treatable.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.316
- Surgery?
- Right.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.057
It'll eliminate the risk
of another seizure,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.625
and it'll correct
your peripheral vision loss.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.366
- But I'd lose my wife.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.368
She--

20:39.412 --> 20:41.283
she'd disappear.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
- Yeah, I mean, you would--

20:43.677 --> 20:46.375
you would no longer see
those images of her.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.905
- I don't want the operation.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.256
- Mr. McIntyre,
without the surgery,

20:57.299 --> 20:58.996
you will have more seizures.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.781
And they'll be more severe.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.827
I mean, you could even
lose your eyesight entirely.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.090
- When Terri died,

21:06.134 --> 21:09.964
I was...lost.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.358
But now, it's--

21:12.401 --> 21:15.186
it's like
I've got her back again.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.754
She--

21:17.798 --> 21:19.887
she's everything to me.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
- You know that I understand

21:21.323 --> 21:24.326
how grateful you are
to have Terri

21:24.370 --> 21:26.067
back in your life,

21:26.110 --> 21:29.940
but another seizure would
probably put you into a coma.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.073
I mean, it could kill you.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.814
- Since Terri died,

21:33.857 --> 21:37.470
I haven't really
been living anyway.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.080
I want to go home.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.430
- Mr. McIntyre,
I can't in good conscience

21:41.474 --> 21:43.258
discharge you
without a treatment plan.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.956
- I'll sign whatever I have to.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.176
I just want to be with my wife.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
- Uh, you know, we will, um--

21:50.439 --> 21:52.920
we will get the paperwork
going, okay?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.051
Thank you, Liam.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.447
- We're not letting him
go home.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.449
- I agree.
- Okay.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.972
Psych hold, then?

22:02.016 --> 22:03.844
- Will, he's not mentally ill.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.324
He's grieving.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.327
I mean, we're asking him
to say goodbye to his wife.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.111
You know, again.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.418
- So what's our play?

22:12.461 --> 22:13.723
- Honestly, I don't know.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.769
Can you buy me a little time?

22:15.812 --> 22:17.466
- Yeah, I can slow-roll
his AMA paperwork.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.251
- Thank you.
- All right.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.434
You brought Dr. Virani in
on your case.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.131
- I needed a consult.

22:30.174 --> 22:33.874
- Usually we all Cardiology
for consults.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.094
- No one upstairs has London
Heart Hospital on their rÃ©sumÃ©.

22:37.138 --> 22:40.010
So I'm sure the resident
Cardiology would've sent down

22:40.054 --> 22:41.838
will understand.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.543
- Dr. Lanik?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.240
Gina Caine in 3--

22:52.283 --> 22:54.111
- Oh. Ms. COVID is a Hoax?

22:54.155 --> 22:55.896
- I upped her high flow O2

22:55.939 --> 22:57.985
and RT is ready
to convert to a BiPAP,

22:58.028 --> 23:00.074
but it's just delaying
the inevitable.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.423
She'll need to be intubated.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.077
- Yeah, but is she
gonna give consent?

23:03.120 --> 23:05.471
- It's been tough just keeping
her on the cannula, so...

23:05.514 --> 23:07.037
it's doubtful.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.865
- Well, you better
change her mind.

23:11.172 --> 23:14.436
- It looks like there's mildly
distended loops of small bowel.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.047
Could be a partial obstruction.
- I'm not sure.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.571
If it were an obstruction,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.921
I'd expect the bowel to be
a lot more dilated than it is.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.923
- So what?
We just agree to disagree?

23:22.966 --> 23:24.359
I mean, that doesn't help her.
- Damn it.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.100
I know something's
causing her pain,

23:26.143 --> 23:29.146
and if it's in there,
we just don't know what it is.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.321
Can't see it.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.975
- Uh, Kara,

23:32.019 --> 23:34.325
build the scan into
a high-res 3D rendering.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.545
Focus on the left flank,
where her pain is the worst.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.554
- Well, how about that?
- Renal vein is compressed.

23:45.598 --> 23:46.947
I mean, it looks like
it's causing

23:46.990 --> 23:49.558
significant left-sided
venous congestion.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.125
That isn't just painful--

23:51.168 --> 23:53.823
- It's excruciating.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.825
[monitor beeping]
- Same drill as before.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.088
Set up to cardiovert,
then 200 milligrams of amio

23:58.132 --> 23:59.350
followed by a drip.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.614
- A-fib with RVR.
Replay on his intake.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.181
- Okay. Synced.
- Clear. Hit it.

24:06.314 --> 24:09.230
- BP's coming back up.
122/73.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.275
Heart rate's settling. 140.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.190
- Still too high.
Add an esmolol drip.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.975
- [dazedly]
It happened again?

24:15.018 --> 24:17.368
My heart?
- Yeah.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.157
Doesn't make sense--his heart's
beating irregularly,

24:23.200 --> 24:24.506
but there's no evidence

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
anything's actually wrong
with him.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.161
- I looked at his chart.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.598
The only other anomaly
is the nosebleed.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.513
- And you think the nosebleed's
connected then?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
- Could be.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.995
I once treated a guy
who slipped in the shower

24:35.038 --> 24:36.213
and dislocated his shoulder.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.172
Random accident, right?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.391
It turns out, he had
undiagnosed celiac disease.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.090
A poor B12 absorption
leads to anemia--

24:43.133 --> 24:44.526
- Leads to weakness
in his feet,

24:44.570 --> 24:46.049
leads to falling in the shower.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.356
- Nothing random about it.

24:48.399 --> 24:51.228
- Trini, repeat CBC, BMP,
cardiac labs, echo.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.621
Leave the EKG.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.928
[sighs]
We're starting over.

25:00.542 --> 25:00.760
.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.501
- This is the reason?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.503
The renal vein
is being compressed?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.765
- It's called
nutcracker syndrome.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.506
Because the pain feels like

25:07.549 --> 25:08.985
you're being squeezed
by a nutcracker.

25:09.029 --> 25:10.683
- All this time.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.033
Right there.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.991
How'd all the other doctors
miss it?

25:15.035 --> 25:16.427
- It hides.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.039
Only get to it by ruling out
everything else first.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.563
- I'm relieved
to finally have an answer,

25:21.607 --> 25:24.610
but my pain,
it's more than a squeeze.

25:24.653 --> 25:27.482
I'm being crushed
by a car compactor.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.528
- Yes, we suspect
a compounding issue,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.486
a second disorder
affecting the ureter.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
Loin pain hematuria syndrome.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.969
- So misery on top of agony.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.014
What's the fix?
- Surgery.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.625
There are two options.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.627
First is a renal vein
transposition.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.280
It'll relieve
the nutcracker syndrome,

25:43.324 --> 25:45.674
but unfortunately, it may not
do anything for the loin pain.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.936
- Option two?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.503
- Embolize the renal artery.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.026
This will help
with the loin pain,

25:50.070 --> 25:52.855
but may aggravate
the nutcracker.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.770
- So let's do both.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.772
- The thing is,
you can't do both.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.557
Together, they would put
too much stress

25:58.600 --> 26:00.689
on the kidney's blood supply.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.430
The organ would fail.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.607
- Then, no.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.131
To both options.

26:08.175 --> 26:11.221
Neither ends my pain,
so what's the point?

26:11.265 --> 26:14.007
- Less pain could make
a huge difference in your life.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.879
- Zero pain is something.

26:16.923 --> 26:20.013
Everything else is just
history repeating itself.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.884
Procedure after procedure,

26:21.928 --> 26:24.713
all of them, colossal failures.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.454
I can't take another one.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.021
I will lose my mind.

26:30.023 --> 26:33.940
I am always going
to live in pain.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.595
It's just time
that I accept that.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.166
[doorknob clicks]

26:43.210 --> 26:44.994
- Hey.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.606
If you're busy,
I could come back later.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.477
- Oh, hell no.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.567
This case had me going
in circles.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.655
Thank you very much.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.005
- You're welcome.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.921
[sighs]

26:58.965 --> 27:00.053
- So?
- Hmm?

27:00.096 --> 27:02.664
- Your day going any better?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.057
- No, in fact,

27:04.100 --> 27:06.146
it fell off a cliff.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.670
- It wouldn't have anything to
do with these updated protocols

27:08.714 --> 27:10.933
I've been hearing
so much about?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.892
- The reps are angry with me.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.937
DEFCON 1 with Gwen

27:14.981 --> 27:17.244
because I got the board
involved.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.289
And then, there's Michael,

27:19.333 --> 27:21.161
who thinks these protocols

27:21.204 --> 27:23.772
are solely because of him.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.209
- And you don't think there's

27:26.253 --> 27:28.516
even a tiny bit of truth
to that?

27:28.559 --> 27:29.952
- Really?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.650
You too?

27:31.693 --> 27:34.522
- If it were any other rep
at the center of this thing,

27:34.565 --> 27:37.612
you think it would
have gotten quite this far?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.267
- Probably not.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.922
He's my son, Daniel.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.967
When he started working here,

27:45.011 --> 27:48.841
I was so excited, but--

27:48.884 --> 27:52.148
- I just don't know how
eventually

27:52.192 --> 27:53.802
that doesn't get complicated.

27:53.846 --> 27:57.066
- Hmm. Yeah.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.808
Ain't that the truth?
[sighs]

28:01.375 --> 28:03.159
Well...

28:03.203 --> 28:05.031
[exhales]

28:05.074 --> 28:08.164
I've got a hard decision
to make.

28:08.208 --> 28:11.298
- I'm here if you need me.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.822
- Thanks.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.651
- [sighs]

28:16.695 --> 28:20.829
[solemn music]

28:20.873 --> 28:27.270
â™ª

28:27.314 --> 28:29.272
- Montez's repeat labs,
all good.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.621
Same for the repeat echo.

28:30.665 --> 28:31.884
- His heart's
now beating normally.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.015
He's back in sinus rhythm.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.625
- Yeah, but still no clue
as to why

28:34.669 --> 28:37.193
it started beating irregularly
or now why it stopped.

28:37.237 --> 28:40.588
- Dr. Choi, Dr. Virani,
it's Montez.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.111
- [coughing]

28:44.810 --> 28:46.246
What's happening?
- Coughing up blood.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.030
That's not a nasal
or a cardiac problem.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.728
It's a lung issue.
- Yeah.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.295
They sound junky.
We need another chest X-ray.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.906
- I'm falling apart.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.299
- Hey, just hang in there,
Montez.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.000
- X-ray up.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.830
- Bottom of the right lung
is partially whited out.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.614
- Two prior chest x-rays,
that wasn't there.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.834
- No, but it is now.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.750
- We need a CT.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.014
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.232
- I got your text.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.799
All I've been hitting
are dead ends.

29:17.843 --> 29:21.672
You got something?
- Yeah, I think so.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.240
Kidney's at the center
of Lisa's pain problems, right?

29:24.284 --> 29:26.112
There's not enough space
for the blood and urine

29:26.155 --> 29:28.854
to flow smoothly, so,

29:28.897 --> 29:31.291
what if I were to move it
to a place where there is?

29:31.334 --> 29:32.901
- That's a massive undertaking.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.337
I mean, if you're willing
to go that far,

29:34.381 --> 29:36.687
why not just remove the kidney
altogether?

29:36.731 --> 29:39.212
Less risk of complications.
- Possibly.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.909
But there'd be
a huge trade-off.

29:40.953 --> 29:44.217
She'd be losing
a perfectly healthy organ.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.958
I mean, look,

29:46.001 --> 29:47.829
if there were a better option,
I'd be all over it.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.223
I'm just--I'm not seeing one.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.880
- A kidney transplant?

29:54.923 --> 29:56.664
- A kidney autotransplant.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.753
It's more like a relocation.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.929
- The new positioning
decompresses the renal vein

30:00.973 --> 30:02.931
so there's no more pressure
on the ureter.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.107
So it both addresses
the nutcracker

30:05.151 --> 30:07.066
and the loin pain.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.071
- I've been let down
so many times.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.682
You're sure this will work?

30:15.988 --> 30:20.035
- The theory is sound.
- Look, I believe it will work.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.432
- Okay.

30:25.475 --> 30:26.999
I'll hope.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.827
- Okay.

30:31.351 --> 30:32.787
- Ms. Caine?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.049
You need to be intubated.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.181
- No tubes.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.835
You put people on that machine,

30:36.878 --> 30:38.967
then never take them off.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.883
It's part of the scam
so they can bill you forever.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.493
[coughing]
Just--give me more oxygen.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.408
- No, that won't work.
COVID attacks your--

30:45.452 --> 30:47.715
- It's not COVID!

30:47.758 --> 30:49.151
- Gina.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.327
Okay, I'm not supposed
to say this,

30:51.371 --> 30:52.720
but you're right.

30:52.763 --> 30:53.982
COVID is a hoax.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.331
It is.
I know it is.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.072
- [wheezing]
About time you admit it.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.726
- I couldn't say anything
before because

30:58.769 --> 31:00.032
I don't want to get fired.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.425
- Can't go against
"the hospital machine."

31:02.469 --> 31:04.427
- Exactly.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.821
Please, just agree
to be intubated.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.867
Let me help you
get past this flu.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.043
And then, we can talk
about the truth.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.871
- [gasps]
Okay.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.785
- All right.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.049
Dr. Lanik?
Intubation in 3.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.877
- Let me suit up.
- Copy.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.360
[monitor beeping]

31:24.404 --> 31:27.276
No, no, no.
No, no, no. Gina?

31:27.320 --> 31:28.756
Gina?

31:28.799 --> 31:31.150
Dr. Lanik, she's crashing.
No pulse.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.936
- What do we got?

31:34.980 --> 31:36.459
- Dr. Lanik?

31:36.503 --> 31:40.855
[alarm sounding]

31:40.899 --> 31:42.944
Bag her.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.467
Come on.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.517
[tense music]

31:50.560 --> 31:58.568
â™ª

31:58.612 --> 32:01.136
- What happened?
- She went into P.E.A.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.095
- All right.
Milligram of epi?

32:03.138 --> 32:04.400
- Already in.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.402
- What?
You pushed meds on your own?

32:06.446 --> 32:07.969
- You weren't gonna make it
in time.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.276
- You can't do that
without a doctor's order.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.413
- Got a pulse.
Sinus rhythm.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.241
Stats are still terrible,
though.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.982
Kit's ready.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.375
Sux and etomidate?

32:22.418 --> 32:25.247
- Give me the tube
and the blade.

32:25.291 --> 32:29.077
[dramatic music]

32:29.121 --> 32:36.998
â™ª

32:37.042 --> 32:37.433
.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.044
- Paperwork's ready.
It's now or never.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.610
- [sighs]

32:44.049 --> 32:46.573
- I'm gonna leave.
You can't stop me.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.489
- Liam, I was just hoping
that you'd indulge me

32:49.532 --> 32:52.753
with one more minute of your
time before we sign you out.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.929
- Okay. What is it?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.278
- Well...

32:58.498 --> 32:59.847
I told you about my wife,

32:59.890 --> 33:01.762
about--about CeCe

33:01.805 --> 33:03.329
and how she recently
passed away.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.765
Um,

33:04.808 --> 33:07.028
whenever I had a big decision
to make,

33:07.072 --> 33:09.074
I mean, she was just
always there, right?

33:09.117 --> 33:12.425
And I--she made me feel safe
that way.

33:12.468 --> 33:16.516
But,
the same for you and Terri?

33:16.559 --> 33:19.345
- Yeah.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.434
- So I guess my question is,

33:21.477 --> 33:23.566
how do you think that--

33:23.610 --> 33:24.915
that Terri would feel?

33:24.959 --> 33:27.092
I mean,

33:27.135 --> 33:28.963
about the surgery?

33:29.007 --> 33:32.662
I mean, what do you think
that she would want you to do?

33:32.706 --> 33:36.492
[quiet music]

33:36.536 --> 33:41.889
â™ª

33:41.932 --> 33:45.414
Liam, I can see the way
that you're looking at her,

33:45.458 --> 33:47.851
and I'm guessing that she's

33:47.895 --> 33:50.724
looking back at you
the same way?

33:53.857 --> 33:55.772
- She loved me.

33:55.816 --> 33:56.860
- So...

33:58.819 --> 34:01.126
Honor that.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.084
Honor that love?

34:09.003 --> 34:11.701
- She'd want me
to have the surgery.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.051
- Yeah.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.530
I-I think so too.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.533
- [crying]

34:17.577 --> 34:20.536
[ambient music]

34:20.580 --> 34:27.587
â™ª

34:28.588 --> 34:31.112
- Look at that.
Bottom of the right lung.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.375
- You were right.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.682
Everything's connected.

34:35.725 --> 34:39.512
It's an arteriovenous
malformation, AVM.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.514
An abnormal tangle
of blood vessels.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.603
- They tear easily.
Results in bleeding.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.605
- The blood I was coughing up.
- Yeah.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.651
And for some, AVMs are
a symptom of a genetic disease

34:48.695 --> 34:52.481
called hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia, HHT.

34:52.525 --> 34:55.528
- A hallmark of HHT
is frequent nosebleeds.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.400
Also, recently research shows
that HHT patients

34:58.444 --> 35:00.794
have a predilection for A-fib.

35:00.837 --> 35:04.624
- These initials--
AVM, HHT--

35:04.667 --> 35:06.191
could I die?
- No.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.757
The conditions are treatable.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.803
Surgery, embolization,
medication.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.413
I'm gonna admit you,
and we'll figure out

35:11.457 --> 35:12.458
what the best option is.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.937
- And my career?

35:13.981 --> 35:15.678
Can I still compete
when I get out of here?

35:15.722 --> 35:18.594
- Nosebleeds may continue
to be an issue,

35:18.638 --> 35:20.074
but today should be
the last time

35:20.118 --> 35:22.555
you see yourself
in hospital.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.426
- Get you back on the court.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.036
U.S. Open awaits.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.438
- April.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.092
[sighs shakily]

35:38.136 --> 35:40.050
So Lanik just went on a rant.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.052
He was so pissed,
I could barely understand him,

35:42.096 --> 35:44.577
but I did manage to make out
"super reckless"

35:44.620 --> 35:46.535
and a threat to fire you.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.058
What happened?

35:48.102 --> 35:50.017
- I pushed meds
without his order.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.497
- What?
What were you thinking?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.586
- The patient was coding.
Lanik was still suiting up.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.978
What was I supposed to do?
Let her die?

35:55.022 --> 35:57.546
- Of course not,
but it doesn't--

35:57.590 --> 35:59.809
- He told me
to solve the problem.

35:59.853 --> 36:00.941
What would you have done?

36:00.984 --> 36:02.725
- April, we are nurses.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.771
Just because
we know what to do,

36:04.814 --> 36:06.642
it doesn't mean we have
the authority to do it.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.645
- Well, I did.
And I saved her life.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.698
- Hey, great work today.
Appreciate the help.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.569
- I really enjoyed
the challenge.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.268
Been a while since I've been on
the detective side of a case.

36:23.311 --> 36:26.184
If you ever need me again,
I'm in.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.707
- Deal.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.143
And, uh,

36:29.187 --> 36:31.754
next time, I won't hesitate.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.104
Truth is, uh,

36:34.148 --> 36:36.106
I was actually deflecting.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.283
I know you and Will
are...close.

36:38.326 --> 36:41.242
Just didn't want to overstep.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.157
- If it helps,
I find nothing untoward

36:43.201 --> 36:45.986
with me seeing Will
and playing chess with you.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.944
- Good to know.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.990
- So now that that's settled,

36:50.033 --> 36:52.906
how much brain power
do you have left today?

36:55.604 --> 36:58.085
[both laugh]

36:58.128 --> 36:59.129
- Game on.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.524
All right.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.136
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.661
- So Lisa's gonna be sore
for a while from the procedure,

37:08.704 --> 37:11.272
but her pain--no more.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.752
- That is fantastic.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.188
- Right?

37:14.232 --> 37:15.842
- I was worried she was
gonna have to add us

37:15.885 --> 37:17.278
to her list of failures.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.672
- Yeah, I was too.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.195
But we pulled it off.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.024
We're a good team.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.852
- [softly]
I hope so.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.157
- Oh.

37:27.201 --> 37:30.291
A wistful tone
after a huge win?

37:30.335 --> 37:31.901
What's going on?

37:31.945 --> 37:33.947
- No, I just, um...

37:33.990 --> 37:36.341
you know, we broke
Lisa's cycle of pain

37:36.384 --> 37:38.299
and put her on a new path.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.649
And I guess I'm just wondering

37:40.693 --> 37:43.652
if you broke yours too.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.132
- I'm not following.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.351
- I mean,
you said this afternoon

37:46.394 --> 37:49.702
that opposites attract,
and they do.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.269
- They don't always
stay together.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.967
- Yeah.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.273
- You know, Manning?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.887
The moment you came
into my life,

38:00.930 --> 38:03.237
my history became just that--

38:03.281 --> 38:05.631
history.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.294
I love you, Natalie.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.036
- I love you too.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.039
[sentimental music]

38:23.083 --> 38:29.045
â™ª

38:29.089 --> 38:30.395
- Liam.

38:30.438 --> 38:34.181
Heard the surgery
went really well.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.662
How you doing?
How you feeling?

38:36.705 --> 38:39.621
- Lonely.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.362
She's gone for good now.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.364
- You think so?

38:43.408 --> 38:46.672
I mean, for myself anyway,

38:46.715 --> 38:48.674
I feel

38:48.717 --> 38:52.242
CeCe's presence all the time.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.941
Honestly, I...

38:54.984 --> 38:58.336
I--I don't know
if they ever really leave us.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.996
[indistinct chatter]

39:16.745 --> 39:18.312
- Michael.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.662
- Can we not, Mom?

39:20.706 --> 39:23.012
- Son, let me talk to you.
Give me a minute.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.187
Come here.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.757
I just wanted to let you know

39:28.801 --> 39:31.804
the board is backing up
my protocol changes.

39:31.847 --> 39:34.023
There will be a new memo
tomorrow.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.940
And you were right.

39:37.984 --> 39:41.944
Some of my motive was personal.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.207
- Okay.
You've got my attention.

39:44.251 --> 39:45.383
- Sit with me a minute?

39:52.172 --> 39:56.263
You know I always want you
to succeed,

39:56.306 --> 39:58.178
but this hospital

39:58.221 --> 40:00.398
is my responsibility.

40:00.441 --> 40:04.097
And when those two things
don't line up,

40:04.140 --> 40:06.404
that's a problem.
- I know.

40:08.884 --> 40:11.060
And it's not all on you.

40:11.104 --> 40:14.455
My ambitions, they're big.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.152
I push.

40:16.196 --> 40:19.286
So when management
pushes back,

40:19.329 --> 40:21.027
it stings.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.202
- Yeah.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.334
- But you're also my mom.

40:24.378 --> 40:27.250
This hits closer to home.
- Yeah.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.169
And that's why I've decided
to leave Med.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.043
- Really?

40:37.086 --> 40:40.220
- I've been thinking about it
for a while.

40:40.263 --> 40:43.266
You cast a long shadow.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.443
Time I get out from under it.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.969
- I raised you right.

40:50.012 --> 40:53.059
I think you're making
the right decision.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.235
- I wanna stay in the city.

40:55.278 --> 40:58.368
Kender has a presence
at Northwestern.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.327
That's what I've put up for.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.547
- Well, they'll be lucky
to have you.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.026
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.420
- And I'm gonna miss
seeing you every day.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.900
- But I'm staying in Chicago.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.945
[both laugh]

41:47.940 --> 41:48.157
.
