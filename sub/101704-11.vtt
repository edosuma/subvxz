I'd like to see it through.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.398
- I got a team.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.573
Thanks.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.140
- Hey, April,
you saved his life.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.707
You're pretty good for a nurse.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.448
Should've gone to med school.

00:13.491 --> 00:14.753
- We have to stick
with the playbook.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.190
- Or we try something else.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.756
- We have
something better in mind.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.323
- How do we sit here
and not even try?

00:19.367 --> 00:20.803
- I'm with you.
- Charged. Clear.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.370
- Okay, let's give it a minute.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.199
- Going behind my back,
throwing up Hail Marys?

00:25.242 --> 00:27.114
You and I have a problem.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.246
- Dr. Marcel?
I've got this new device.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.467
- Promoting your products
for unapproved uses?

00:32.510 --> 00:33.642
- They could've worked.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.860
- This is far beyond the bounds

00:34.904 --> 00:37.515

00:37.559 --> 00:40.083
- I started seeing someone new.
Dr. Marcel.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
- You haven't introduced him
to Owen yet, have you?

00:42.390 --> 00:44.392
- Where is all this
coming from?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.090
- It was pitch-black.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
I couldn't see my hand
in front of my face.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.529
So here I am, moving slowly,

00:51.573 --> 00:53.705

00:53.749 --> 00:57.144

across the water,

00:57.187 --> 00:58.493
when there he is.

00:58.536 --> 01:01.409
- You do remember that
I have a heart condition?

01:01.452 --> 01:03.846
- Oh, in that moment,
I did too.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.195
He was big.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.589
Terrifying big, right?

01:07.632 --> 01:08.807
But I was gonna get him.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.114

You went in closer.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.551
- Oh, I had to.
All or nothing.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.205
So I eased in,

01:15.249 --> 01:18.121
lined him up.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.253
Then, pop!

01:19.296 --> 01:21.168
Got him.

Look at this.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130

- Look at that.

he's right there.

- Yeah. Wow.

the door got closed.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.142
- I asked Crockett
about his hobbies,

01:39.186 --> 01:41.362
and he said photography.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.320
- Yes, I think we were
about, what, five minutes

01:43.364 --> 01:45.409
into our first dinner
before he pulled that story out

01:45.453 --> 01:46.889
and showed me the picture.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.761
Yeah, I think it was his move
to try and impress me.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.329
Mm-hmm.
- Busted.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.809
But here we are,

01:53.852 --> 01:55.724

01:55.767 --> 01:56.942
Mission accomplished.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.770

01:58.814 --> 02:01.425
So Crockett?
- Mm-hmm?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.471
- I know that you are a surgeon

02:03.514 --> 02:06.256
and have an eye for reptiles.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.431
What else?

02:07.475 --> 02:08.563
Any siblings?

02:08.606 --> 02:09.825
- Yeah, a younger sister.
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.218
- Lives in Baton Rouge.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.697
- And your parents?

02:12.741 --> 02:15.483
Yeah, Natalie tells me
that they emigrated from Iran.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.964
So does that mean
that your family is Muslim?

02:19.008 --> 02:22.229
- No, we're actually
Zoroastrian.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.621
- "Zoroastrian"?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.449
I'm sorry. I--

02:25.493 --> 02:27.495
- Yeah, it dates back
to ancient Persia.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.672

good words, good deeds.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.761
- Hmm.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.589
- Not always so easy.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.808
- Hmm.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.593
That's very interesting.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.203
- Yeah.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.900

02:41.944 --> 02:44.425
- Does anyone want some coffee?
- Yeah, I'll take some.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.209

- Yes, sweetheart.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.341
Thank you.

Is that a new suit?

03:05.359 --> 03:06.969

some adjustments

03:07.012 --> 03:09.450
so all the reps
are on the same page.

no one's overstepping.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.283

the only red hat

03:17.632 --> 03:18.937

off-label.

03:18.981 --> 03:19.982

03:20.025 --> 03:21.418
- Then why does this feel
personal?

03:21.462 --> 03:22.767
- This wasn't intentional.

03:22.811 --> 03:26.336
The updates are solely
to protect the hospital.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.990

08:20.630 --> 08:22.110
- Yeah, I'll contact
Dr. Charles.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.241
- Mm-hmm.
- Done.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.071
- Thanks.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.423
I wanted to apologize
about last night.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.599
My mom--
- No.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.296
No apology necessary.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.863
Look, I grew up
in the Bible Belt.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.561
You're either Catholic,
Methodist, or Southern Baptist.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.476
Not...different, you know?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.999
So I'm used to it.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.566
- Nat, Crockett,
patient in treatment 4.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.220
Her name is Lisa Holtzman.
- Thanks, Mags.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.264
- Okay.
- All right.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.657
- [whimpering]

08:47.701 --> 08:49.311
- Hi, Lisa.
I'm Dr. Manning.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.747
This is Dr. Marcel.
- Hi.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.401
- Belly...radiating.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.229
- "Radiating"?
Not a lay term.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.491
You a doctor?
- No.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.232
Professional patient.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.234
- You mind if I lift your gown?

08:59.277 --> 09:00.670
Okay.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.325
- Those scars on your abdomen,
laparoscopic ports?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.631
- Appendix, gall bladder,
all gone.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
- Okay. I'm gonna...

09:06.110 --> 09:08.243
- [groans]

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
- Fullness in the pelvis.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.333
All right, we're gonna
do an ultrasound, okay?

09:11.376 --> 09:12.421
- Okay.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.252
- Can't see anything.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.601
Bladder's huge and in the way.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.516
Lisa, when's the last time
you urinated?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.691
- I don't know.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.345
Yesterday, I think?

09:23.388 --> 09:25.565
- Well, pain could be coming
from urinary retention.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.262
Foley?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.481
We're gonna drain your bladder.
It should help ease the pain.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.613
Okay?
- Okay.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.354
- And get you some med too,
all right?

09:32.397 --> 09:35.357
- My bag.
Grab what's inside.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.495
What is all this?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.497
- My medical records.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.852
- Hey, Montez.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.375
How are you feeling?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.681
- Exhausted.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.292
And then there's all this...

09:57.335 --> 09:59.511
- Your heart's still
beating irregularly.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.731
Too fast--I'm trying to get
a read on why.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.733
Your vitals are fine.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.866
EKG and echo were both normal.

10:05.909 --> 10:09.391
- So you're saying I'm healthy?
- No.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.872
The chart is, but it's wrong.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.656
The heart of
a 21-year-old pro athlete

10:13.700 --> 10:15.658
should not spontaneously
go into A-fib.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.619
- This can't be it.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.751
I'm too close.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.579
My father loved tennis.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.581
I was maybe four.
He tossed me balls.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.714
Pretended it was the U.S. Open.

10:27.757 --> 10:31.456
He'd say, "One day, Montez.
Arthur Ashe Stadium."

10:33.633 --> 10:37.158
He died when I was seven.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.681
I've been training for the Open
ever since,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.552
and now, I'm inches away.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.297
I need to play
in that tournament.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.647
- I'll keep looking,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.518
figure this out.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.521
- Seriously?
Damn it!

10:52.564 --> 10:54.479
- Put pressure.
Lean your head forward.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.700
Ice pack.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.528
- I got it. I got it.
It happens when I'm stressed.

10:59.571 --> 11:00.660
It'll stop.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.581
- What the hell, Sharon?
- Ms. Goodwin, I'm so sorry.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.367
- That's all right, Cheryl.
I always have time for our COO.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.934
- Well, my phone
has been ringing

11:13.977 --> 11:16.719
off the hook this morning.
Angry reps.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.330
Your unilateral changes
to our red hat protocols--

11:19.374 --> 11:20.723
they're trouble.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.594
- I have to do what's best
for the hospital, Gwen,

11:22.638 --> 11:25.685
which means reducing
liabilities wherever they are.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.904
- Our relationship
with pharma and biotech,

11:27.948 --> 11:29.471
they help keep the lights on.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.647
If Med is suddenly difficult
to work with,

11:31.691 --> 11:32.866
they move to East Mercy.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.389
We lose funding.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.826
- This is our house.
They can play by our rules.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.481
- Not these.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.830
I'm shutting them down.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.667
.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.450
- Three.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.278
- Good.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.933
Mind me asking where
you were headed this morning

11:56.977 --> 12:00.371
when you had your accident?
- Nowhere really.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.938
Four.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.940
- Right.
Just out running errands?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.377
- Just driving.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.292
Was cooped up for over a year.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
But now that
I'm finally vaccinated,

12:09.816 --> 12:12.209
I'll take any excuse I can
to leave the house.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.820
- I hear that.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.257
I mean, whoever thought we'd
actually be looking forward

12:16.300 --> 12:18.433
to picking up our dry cleaning,
right?

12:18.476 --> 12:20.217
No fingers yet?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.958
- Now, I see it. Two.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.352
- Okay. Okay, good.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.877
So, Liam, tell me, uh,

12:27.921 --> 12:30.053
what's in the corner?

12:30.097 --> 12:32.969
- What?
No one.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.797
- Wait, is it a person?

12:38.845 --> 12:40.716
- It's my wife.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
Terri.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.502
- Okay.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.418
- She died
three weeks into lockdown.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.072
Aneurysm.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
- Very sorry to hear that.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.469
- We were actually looking
forward to being quarantined.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.080
Cook all those recipes
we never had time for.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.517
Then she was just...

12:59.561 --> 13:01.868
gone.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.348
Look.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.525
I know she'd dead,

13:07.569 --> 13:10.354
but I swear, she's--

13:10.398 --> 13:12.052
she's right there.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.444
- You know what?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.359
I believe you.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.884
Tell me, how long roughly

13:17.927 --> 13:21.365
have you been seeing her?

13:21.409 --> 13:24.847
- A few months.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.372
I know my mind is
playing tricks on me,

13:28.416 --> 13:30.200
but I don't care.

13:30.244 --> 13:33.247
Losing Terri was devastating,

13:33.290 --> 13:35.858
so having her back,

13:35.902 --> 13:39.122
even like this, it's...

13:39.166 --> 13:41.777
salvation.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.040
- You know, I, um--

13:44.084 --> 13:47.043
I actually lost my wife
not that long ago,

13:47.087 --> 13:51.004
so trust me, I get it.

13:51.047 --> 13:55.051
Look, I'm going to have
a quick chat with Dr. Halstead,

13:55.095 --> 13:57.445
and then, I will--
I'll be back.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.229
All right?
- Okay.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.232
[soft dramatic music]

14:02.276 --> 14:05.061
♪

14:05.105 --> 14:06.889
- So what do you think?
Dementia?

14:06.933 --> 14:10.545
- No. You know, he's lucid.
He's oriented.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.243
His peripheral vision
is virtually nonexistent

14:13.287 --> 14:15.071
on the right side in both eyes,
all right?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.856
And that blind spot is exactly

14:16.899 --> 14:18.422
where he's seeing
his dead wife.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.076
- So she's
a visual hallucination.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.382
- Right, and I think
we're looking at

14:21.425 --> 14:22.600
Charles Bonnet Syndrome, right?

14:22.644 --> 14:25.342
Where the brain responds
to vision loss

14:25.386 --> 14:26.996
by filling in the blanks.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.302
But here's the thing.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.912
I'm not seeing any evidence
of, you know,

14:29.956 --> 14:32.262
standard signs of vision loss,
which makes me think

14:32.306 --> 14:33.785
that we're--I don't know.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.831
We might be looking at some
deeper brain or eye issue.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.268
- I'll order an MRI.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.357
- Thank you.
- Yep.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.272
- Lisa, hi.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.318
So we got your initial
lab results back,

14:44.361 --> 14:47.060
and it was normal
all across the board.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.453
- [sighs]

14:49.497 --> 14:52.065
- I'm sorry.
Normal is usually good news.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.893
- I let myself get my hopes up.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.633
I shouldn't have done that.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.462
Volume seven of my 16-year war

14:58.506 --> 15:00.595
with abdominal pain.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.119
All I know, it's not IBS.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.468
Or endometriosis.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.514
Or interstitial cystitis.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.951
Kidney stones, pancreatitis,

15:08.995 --> 15:11.301
bowel obstruction.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.435
It hurts the worst right here.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.133
There has to be a reason.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.962
But I have been poked, prodded,

15:20.006 --> 15:22.182
scanned, cut open,

15:22.225 --> 15:24.445
and no one ever finds anything!

15:24.488 --> 15:26.882
- Lisa, I can't even imagine
your frustration--

15:26.926 --> 15:28.492
- But I don't need sympathy.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.364
I need you to fix me.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.540
- We'll do our best.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.369
Unfortunately,
that does require more pokes,

15:35.412 --> 15:39.155
prods, X-rays, scans.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.070
- Have at it.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.290
- Okay.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.688
- Hi. Ms. Caine?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.429
I'm April.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.909
What happened to your cannula?

15:53.953 --> 15:57.130
- Pulled it out.
Who knows what's really in it?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.262
And you don't need
the space suit.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.916
- Hmm, one day.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.092
But for now, it's a precaution
we take in the COVID ICU.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.529
- I don't have coronavirus.
- No?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.401
- It's not real.
Big scam.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.185
[coughing]
- Okay.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.274
But I can see you're
having trouble breathing.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.408
- It's just the flu.
Get it every year.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.019
- Well, flu or not,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.021
a little extra oxygen

16:19.065 --> 16:21.371
might help you feel
more comfortable.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.546
What do you say?

16:22.590 --> 16:25.158
Want to give the cannula
another shot?

16:25.201 --> 16:27.377
- [weakly]
Fine.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.422
- Okay.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.042
- I saw him play
a couple months ago.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.261
On TV, that is.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.958
- You're a tennis fan?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.047
- I was that night.
Couldn't sleep.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.963
His match was the only show
that was on at 2:00 a.m.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.356
Hell of a player.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.010
Is he gonna be okay?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.054
- I'm not sure.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.230
A-fib problem.
Don't know why.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.753
- Well, I'm a cardiologist.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.625
Can I help?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.195
- Thanks, but technically,
you're limited

17:02.238 --> 17:05.111
to seeing patients who are part
of your clinical trial.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.460
- Totally understand.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.247
- I cauterized
the active bleeders.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.207
Should help stem the tide.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.166
Kid keeps asking me
if his career is over.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.125
I didn't know what to say.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.996
- Neither do I.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.084
- Thanks.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.658
- Dr. Virani.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.443
I reconsidered.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
I'll send you the chart.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.409
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.671
- What's this?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.673
- That is a Persian spice set.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.631
Gift from your mom.
- Oh.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.329
- Even comes with a, uh--

17:49.372 --> 17:51.157
an array of popular recipes.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.333
- Oh, this is awkward.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.117
- I'm Iranian.
We love to cook.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.293
It's a wonderful gift.
Thoughtful.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.513
Never got a gesture like that
from my ex in-laws.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.210
- What do you mean?

18:01.254 --> 18:03.343
- You know, a Persian
Zoroastrian son-in-law

18:03.386 --> 18:06.041
is not what they had in mind
for their southern belle.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.608
- I mean, from the little
I know about Claire,

18:07.651 --> 18:09.653
you two seem pretty different,
so...

18:09.697 --> 18:11.307
- Opposites attract, I guess.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.570
Didn't keep us together,
though.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.225
Uh, is that Lisa's
latest test results?

18:16.269 --> 18:18.445
- Yes. The labs are all normal.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.664
Same with the KUB
and trans-vaginal ultrasound.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.710
Next up is a CT.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.669
- I'll squeeze that
into my locker.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.149
I'll meet you upstairs.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.761
- Sharon.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.763
You know the E.D.'s hurting
for staffing.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.244
But same time,
with the pandemic,

18:35.288 --> 18:37.638
nursing and med school
enrollments have surged.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.683
- A silver lining.
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.686
I was thinking we expand
the E.D. training programs

18:42.730 --> 18:44.514
to match demand.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.863
Puts Med on the map,

18:45.907 --> 18:47.865
and we get helping hands.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.693
Win-win.
- I like it.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.347
Write a proposal.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.175
- All right!

18:53.219 --> 18:54.568
What's up?

18:54.611 --> 18:57.353
- I updated Med's protocols
for the pharma reps,

18:57.397 --> 19:00.878
and Gwen's undoing them,
playing hero in the process.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.143
And now,
all the reps owe her one.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.146
No doubt she'll enjoy
using that against me.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.588
My smile convincing enough?

19:14.631 --> 19:18.244
- Very professional.
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.246
[monitor beeping]

19:20.289 --> 19:23.249
- Grand mal seizure.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.467
Five of Ativan.
- Yeah.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.350
- Mr. McIntyre?

19:37.393 --> 19:39.743
You just had a seizure.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.441
- Terri?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.225
[whimpers]
Terri?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.531
Terri, where are you?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.446
Terri?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.317
Oh! Oh, there you are.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.319
Oh, there you are.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.799
[panting]

19:51.842 --> 19:53.148
Thank God.

20:00.938 --> 20:01.112
.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.375
- A tumor?

20:02.418 --> 20:03.767
- In your brain's
vision center.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
The left occipital lobe.
It caused your seizure.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.771
And it's safe to assume

20:07.815 --> 20:10.252
an earlier one led
to your car accident.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.254
- Vision center?

20:12.298 --> 20:13.603
That's also why--

20:13.647 --> 20:15.039
- That's right.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.738
The tumor created a blind spot,
right?

20:17.781 --> 20:20.393
And in order to make sense
of that void,

20:20.436 --> 20:22.264
your brain has been
filling it in

20:22.308 --> 20:24.223
with images of your wife.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.703
- Now, Liam, I know a brain
tumor can sound overwhelming,

20:26.747 --> 20:28.879
but yours is treatable.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.316
- Surgery?
- Right.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.057
It'll eliminate the risk
of another seizure,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.625
and it'll correct
your peripheral vision loss.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.366
- But I'd lose my wife.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.368
She--

20:39.412 --> 20:41.283
she'd disappear.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
- Yeah, I mean, you would--

20:43.677 --> 20:46.375
you would no longer see
those images of her.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.905
- I don't want the operation.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.256
- Mr. McIntyre,
without the surgery,

20:57.299 --> 20:58.996
you will have more seizures.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.781
And they'll be more severe.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.827
I mean, you could even
lose your eyesight entirely.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.090
- When Terri died,

21:06.134 --> 21:09.964
I was...lost.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.358
But now, it's--

21:12.401 --> 21:15.186
it's like
I've got her back again.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.754
She--

21:17.798 --> 21:19.887
she's everything to me.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
- You know that I understand

21:21.323 --> 21:24.326
how grateful you are
to have Terri

21:24.370 --> 21:26.067
back in your life,

21:26.110 --> 21:29.940
but another seizure would
probably put you into a coma.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.073
I mean, it could kill you.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.814
- Since Terri died,

21:33.857 --> 21:37.470
I haven't really
been living anyway.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.080
I want to go home.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.430
- Mr. McIntyre,
I can't in good conscience

21:41.474 --> 21:43.258
discharge you
without a treatment plan.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.956
- I'll sign whatever I have to.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.176
I just want to be with my wife.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
- Uh, you know, we will, um--

21:50.439 --> 21:52.920
we will get the paperwork
going, okay?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.051
Thank you, Liam.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.447
- We're not letting him
go home.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.449
- I agree.
- Okay.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.972
Psych hold, then?

22:02.016 --> 22:03.844
- Will, he's not mentally ill.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.324
He's grieving.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.327
I mean, we're asking him
to say goodbye to his wife.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.111
You know, again.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.418
- So what's our play?

22:12.461 --> 22:13.723
- Honestly, I don't know.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.769
Can you buy me a little time?

22:15.812 --> 22:17.466
- Yeah, I can slow-roll
his AMA paperwork.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.251
- Thank you.
- All right.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.434
You brought Dr. Virani in
on your case.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.131
- I needed a consult.

22:30.174 --> 22:33.874
- Usually we all Cardiology
for consults.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.094
- No one upstairs has London
Heart Hospital on their résumé.

22:37.138 --> 22:40.010
So I'm sure the resident
Cardiology would've sent down

22:40.054 --> 22:41.838
will understand.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.543
- Dr. Lanik?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.240
Gina Caine in 3--

22:52.283 --> 22:54.111
- Oh. Ms. COVID is a Hoax?

22:54.155 --> 22:55.896
- I upped her high flow O2

22:55.939 --> 22:57.985
and RT is ready
to convert to a BiPAP,

22:58.028 --> 23:00.074
but it's just delaying
the inevitable.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.423
She'll need to be intubated.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.077
- Yeah, but is she
gonna give consent?

23:03.120 --> 23:05.471
- It's been tough just keeping
her on the cannula, so...

23:05.514 --> 23:07.037
it's doubtful.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.865
- Well, you better
change her mind.

23:11.172 --> 23:14.436
- It looks like there's mildly
distended loops of small bowel.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.047
Could be a partial obstruction.
- I'm not sure.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.571
If it were an obstruction,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.921
I'd expect the bowel to be
a lot more dilated than it is.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.923
- So what?
We just agree to disagree?

23:22.966 --> 23:24.359
I mean, that doesn't help her.
- Damn it.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.100
I know something's
causing her pain,

23:26.143 --> 23:29.146
and if it's in there,
we just don't know what it is.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.321
Can't see it.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.975
- Uh, Kara,

23:32.019 --> 23:34.325
build the scan into
a high-res 3D rendering.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.545
Focus on the left flank,
where her pain is the worst.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.554
- Well, how about that?
- Renal vein is compressed.

23:45.598 --> 23:46.947
I mean, it looks like
it's causing

23:46.990 --> 23:49.558
significant left-sided
venous congestion.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.125
That isn't just painful--

23:51.168 --> 23:53.823
- It's excruciating.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.825
[monitor beeping]
- Same drill as before.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.088
Set up to cardiovert,
then 200 milligrams of amio

23:58.132 --> 23:59.350
followed by a drip.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.614
- A-fib with RVR.
Replay on his intake.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.181
- Okay. Synced.
- Clear. Hit it.

24:06.314 --> 24:09.230
- BP's coming back up.
122/73.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.275
Heart rate's settling. 140.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.190
- Still too high.
Add an esmolol drip.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.975
- [dazedly]
It happened again?

24:15.018 --> 24:17.368
My heart?
- Yeah.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.157
Doesn't make sense--his heart's
beating irregularly,

24:23.200 --> 24:24.506
but there's no evidence

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
anything's actually wrong
with him.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.161
- I looked at his chart.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.598
The only other anomaly
is the nosebleed.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.513
- And you think the nosebleed's
connected then?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
- Could be.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.995
I once treated a guy
who slipped in the shower

24:35.038 --> 24:36.213
and dislocated his shoulder.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.172
Random accident, right?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.391
It turns out, he had
undiagnosed celiac disease.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.090
A poor B12 absorption
leads to anemia--

24:43.133 --> 24:44.526
- Leads to weakness
in his feet,

24:44.570 --> 24:46.049
leads to falling in the shower.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.356
- Nothing random about it.

24:48.399 --> 24:51.228
- Trini, repeat CBC, BMP,
cardiac labs, echo.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.621
Leave the EKG.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.928
[sighs]
We're starting over.

25:00.542 --> 25:00.760
.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.501
- This is the reason?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.503
The renal vein
is being compressed?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.765
- It's called
nutcracker syndrome.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.506
Because the pain feels like

25:07.549 --> 25:08.985
you're being squeezed
by a nutcracker.

25:09.029 --> 25:10.683
- All this time.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.033
Right there.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.991
How'd all the other doctors
miss it?

25:15.035 --> 25:16.427
- It hides.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.039
Only get to it by ruling out
everything else first.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.563
- I'm relieved
to finally have an answer,

25:21.607 --> 25:24.610
but my pain,
it's more than a squeeze.

25:24.653 --> 25:27.482
I'm being crushed
by a car compactor.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.528
- Yes, we suspect
a compounding issue,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.486
a second disorder
affecting the ureter.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
Loin pain hematuria syndrome.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.969
- So misery on top of agony.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.014
What's the fix?
- Surgery.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.625
There are two options.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.627
First is a renal vein
transposition.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.280
It'll relieve
the nutcracker syndrome,

25:43.324 --> 25:45.674
but unfortunately, it may not
do anything for the loin pain.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.936
- Option two?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.503
- Embolize the renal artery.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.026
This will help
with the loin pain,

25:50.070 --> 25:52.855
but may aggravate
the nutcracker.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.770
- So let's do both.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.772
- The thing is,
you can't do both.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.557
Together, they would put
too much stress

25:58.600 --> 26:00.689
on the kidney's blood supply.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.430
The organ would fail.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.607
- Then, no.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.131
To both options.

26:08.175 --> 26:11.221
Neither ends my pain,
so what's the point?

26:11.265 --> 26:14.007
- Less pain could make
a huge difference in your life.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.879
- Zero pain is something.

26:16.923 --> 26:20.013
Everything else is just
history repeating itself.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.884
Procedure after procedure,

26:21.928 --> 26:24.713
all of them, colossal failures.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.454
I can't take another one.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.021
I will lose my mind.

26:30.023 --> 26:33.940
I am always going
to live in pain.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.595
It's just time
that I accept that.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.166
[doorknob clicks]

26:43.210 --> 26:44.994
- Hey.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.606
If you're busy,
I could come back later.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.477
- Oh, hell no.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.567
This case had me going
in circles.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.655
Thank you very much.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.005
- You're welcome.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.921
[sighs]

26:58.965 --> 27:00.053
- So?
- Hmm?

27:00.096 --> 27:02.664
- Your day going any better?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.057
- No, in fact,

27:04.100 --> 27:06.146
it fell off a cliff.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.670
- It wouldn't have anything to
do with these updated protocols

27:08.714 --> 27:10.933
I've been hearing
so much about?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.892
- The reps are angry with me.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.937
DEFCON 1 with Gwen

27:14.981 --> 27:17.244
because I got the board
involved.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.289
And then, there's Michael,

27:19.333 --> 27:21.161
who thinks these protocols

27:21.204 --> 27:23.772
are solely because of him.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.209
- And you don't think there's

27:26.253 --> 27:28.516
even a tiny bit of truth
to that?

27:28.559 --> 27:29.952
- Really?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.650
You too?

27:31.693 --> 27:34.522
- If it were any other rep
at the center of this thing,

27:34.565 --> 27:37.612
you think it would
have gotten quite this far?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.267
- Probably not.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.922
He's my son, Daniel.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.967
When he started working here,
