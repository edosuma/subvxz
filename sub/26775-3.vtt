00:03.210 --> 00:04.370
. .1 ’ve been
agon/smg over to Whom

00:04.460 --> 00:06.701
I shall leave my beloved River Run.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.248
I've decided to name
my nephew, Jamie, as my heir.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.042
I can't own slaves, Jamie.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.347
There is another way
to become a landowner.

00:18.430 --> 00:20.557
We could reconsider
Governor T/yon ’5 offer.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.096
We wouldn't have to own slaves.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.936
Live on our own terms.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.306
My friend John ancy Myers is wsiong.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.146
What are they like? The Indians?

00:28.270 --> 00:32.195
Some can be friendly,
some you'd do well to steer clear of.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.732
Rogen
what are you doing in town?

00:35.820 --> 00:38.789
I found him. You can go to Jamie.

00:38.870 --> 00:42.749
Brianna needs someone to talk to,
and you're the only one who understands.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.286
- He's a good one.
- I know.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.917
S/ng me a song

00:50.000 --> 00:52.912
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.010 --> 00:56.002
Say, could that lass

00:56.090 --> 00:58.502
Be 1'?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.636
Merry of soul

01:00.720 --> 01:03.939
She sa/led on a day

01:04.020 --> 01:06.011
Over the sea

01:06.100 --> 01:08.568
7'0 Skye

01:09.150 --> 01:11.607
[Wow and breeze

01:11.690 --> 01:14.238
Islands and seas

01:14.320 --> 01:19.235
Mountains of rain and sun

01:19.530 --> 01:21.907
All that was good

01:22.000 --> 01:24.707
All that was fair

01:24.790 --> 01:27.372
All that was me

01:27.460 --> 01:30.088
Is gone

01:30.170 --> 01:32.081
S/ng me a song

01:32.170 --> 01:35.048
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.130 --> 01:37.542
Say, could that lass

01:37.640 --> 01:40.256
Be 1'?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.511
Merry of soul

01:42.600 --> 01:45.433
She sa/led on a day

Over the sea

01:49.650 --> 01:54.565
7'0 Skye

02:37.400 --> 02:38.947
- Well, ho.
- Hey.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.828
Since when do ye stop playing
when ye see me?

02:41.910 --> 02:43.400
Ah. Just messing around.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.696
- It was lovely.
- Thank you.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.699
Well...

02:50.880 --> 02:53.337
Congratulations on your new home.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.662
Salt, for life's tears.
May they always be happy ones.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.790
May ye have flavour in your life.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.086
You'll need a toast, of course.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.426
Let's crack it open.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.597
Uh... Aye, it'll do among friends, eh?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.389
Mmm?

03:16.650 --> 03:20.199
May the roof above never fall in,
and may we below never fall out.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.407
Here's to honest men and bonnie lasses.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.649
Well...

03:31.620 --> 03:32.951
I better get going.

03:41.590 --> 03:45.629
Roger's headed to America
for a Scottish festival.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.307
Ye're leaving Scotland
to go to a Scottish festival?

03:48.390 --> 03:50.017
No. I was invited to play.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.050
- And?
- And...

03:52.810 --> 03:55.222
Roger's courting a lass in America.

03:55.770 --> 03:59.854
She's studying engineering
at MIT in Boston.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.065
Ernie, be a dear,

04:02.160 --> 04:04.981
and let the removal men_ know
where to place the furniture.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.572
- I'll see Roger off.
- Goodbye, Roger.

04:07.660 --> 04:08.786
- Bye.
- Good luck.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.076
Thank you.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.319
Well...

04:17.130 --> 04:19.507
When is the last time you saw Brianna?

04:20.470 --> 04:24.008
She visited me at Oxford
during our summer break,

04:24.510 --> 04:27.138
and we spent Christmas
together again in Boston,

04:27.220 --> 04:29.381
but it's been a while.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.881
We write and have
the occa5|onal telephone call,

04:32.980 --> 04:36.518
but, well, with my teaching
and her studies...

04:38.320 --> 04:39.389
Ye have to tell her.

04:40.610 --> 04:41.599
Tell her what?

04:41.690 --> 04:44.488
I may no' read tea leaves
like my grannie...

04:45.030 --> 04:46.691
but I can see ye're in love wi' her.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.189
Uh...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.609
Now, go get her.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.127
Thanks, Fi. I'll see you.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.432
I suppose
there’s no changing yer mind?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.561
Aye.

05:20.690 --> 05:21.679
We must leave.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.146
I wanted so badly for ye to stay.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.733
I thought perhaps, in time, ye would
begin to love River Run as I do,

05:31.290 --> 05:33.997
and accept the ways
that are different here.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.609
I'm sorry, Auntie.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.031
I'll only be master to my own soul.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.547
Where will ye go, nephew?

05:43.170 --> 05:46.378
Well, we'll keep to the plan
we had before we arrived.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.421
Take Ian back to Wilmington.

05:50.510 --> 05:51.841
He'll board a ship home,

05:52.560 --> 05:53.595
and...

05:54.600 --> 05:57.649
And we'll travel west
toward the mountains.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.930
I heard there's a town

06:01.020 --> 06:02.681
wi' a great number
of Scottish settlers there.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.021
Aye. Woolam's Creek.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.232
Claire can practice her healing.
I can find work as a printer.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.487
"Printer."

06:12.080 --> 06:13.069
Now...

06:15.660 --> 06:16.957
And I'll return this.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.410
- Ye may keep it.
- No.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.489
I insist.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.955
I'll no' accept what I didna earn.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.429
Dinna let yer pride stand in the way
of your family's security.

06:30.470 --> 06:34.839
Ulysses will ready some horses for you
and a wagon to carry provisions.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.591
That will get ye where ye're going.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.939
And he will provide ye with a rifle
and some pistols as well.

06:41.690 --> 06:42.816
I'm grateful.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.186
And one last thing...

06:48.950 --> 06:50.269
These were yer mother's.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.572
I ken she would want ye to have them.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.006
I'll treasure them.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.798
No good comes grieving
over what is already lost,

07:14.930 --> 07:20.516
but what I wouldna give
to look upon yer face just once.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.281
I already told ye no.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.656
I made a promise to yer parents
to see you home safe.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.069
Ye belong wi' them.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.208
'Twas a promise you shouldna
even have made.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.837
I didna belong to anyone.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.285
Ye're too young to be on yer own.

07:45.710 --> 07:47.337
I'll not be on my own.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.126
I'll be with you and Auntie Claire.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.579
Ye're going home.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.874
Do you not recall

07:51.970 --> 07:55.042
that you sailed to France when you
were younger than I am now?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.517
By the time ye were my age,
ye were fighting a war.

07:58.430 --> 08:01.092
It may have been a war,
but the country was civilised.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.307
There are savages here
and dangers we dinna yet ken.

08:06.230 --> 08:07.857
"Dangers we dinna yet ken"?

08:08.360 --> 08:11.739
And what of those I do ken?
The dangers I've already faced?

08:11.820 --> 08:16.189
I've been set upon by pirates twice,
kidnapped, thrown into a pit,

08:16.370 --> 08:17.826
sailed through a hurricane.

08:18.740 --> 08:21.868
Before we came here,
I saw things through the eyes of a boy.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.281
But the things I've seen
have changed me.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.877
I'm no' the same lad
ye kent In Scotland.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.290
I'm a man,

08:28.460 --> 08:30.792
free to call the place I choose home.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.750
I'll not stand in yer way any longer.

08:40.350 --> 08:41.920
I'll write yer mother and father.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.227
Hey, a man writes his own letters.

08:44.810 --> 08:48.223
Word of my decision
to stay in America will come from me.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.519
We leave today.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.667
I've come to say goodbye.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.628
What happened last night...

09:12.880 --> 09:14.086
I wish it had been different.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.539
So do I.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.974
I ken we're not of like mind,
but I admire a woman of conviction.

09:23.810 --> 09:27.223
My blindness doesna prevent me
from seeing how much you love my nephew.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.813
It doesn't prevent you from much,
as far as I can tell.

09:37.780 --> 09:38.769
Goodbye.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.987
You're doing him
a great disservice, ye ken.

09:45.750 --> 09:46.819
I beg your pardon?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.286
You're his reason
he wouldna accept my offer.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.797
You've a good deal of influence on him,

09:51.880 --> 09:54.041
and he's blinded by his passion for you.

09:54.170 --> 09:57.128
If you truly loved Jamie
as much as ye say ye do,

09:57.800 --> 10:00.462
you'd want him to be
the man he was born to be,

10:00.930 --> 10:04.013
to have the things he lost in Scotland,
the chance to be a laird.

10:05.850 --> 10:07.932
You haven't seen Jamie
smce he was a boy,

10:08.770 --> 10:11.512
and you've known us together
all of a few days.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.394
You know nothing about me or my husband.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.612
I ken that my nephew's no ordinary man.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.782
To allow him to squander his talents
behind a printer's counter...

10:27.620 --> 10:29.372
It would be a dreadful shame.

10:32.710 --> 10:35.838
Thank you again for your hospitality.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.422
Clarence is as strong and friendly

10:46.770 --> 10:48.886
and loud a mule as ever God made.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.432
I appreciate it, Ulysses.
He'll serve us well.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.902
You'll find some oatcakes
and salted meat for the Journey

11:00.990 --> 11:02.946
among your belongings, Mistress Claire.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.406
Thank you, Phaedre.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.410
Huh.

11:15.170 --> 11:19.834
Uncle Jamie, Auntie Claire,
this is John Quincy Myers.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.079
Pleased to meet you.

11:22.430 --> 11:23.465
I'm told it's thanks to you

11:23.550 --> 11:26.633
we'll not be travelling
with a foul-smelling hound amongst us.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.188
-Indeed.
- What are you doing here?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.649
Your Auntie Jocasta tells me you're
travelling west to Woolam's Creek.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.726
As it so happens,
I'm going that way myself.

11:35.190 --> 11:37.272
I'd be happy to guide you
into the Blue Ridge.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.102
That would be most useful.
Thank you, Mr Myers.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.997
Your nephew bids you farewell, Mistress.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.239
Hi.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.699
Hi.

12:38.130 --> 12:39.119
Um...

12:42.970 --> 12:45.177
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

12:46.550 --> 12:49.804
- How was your flight?
- Ah. Bumpy.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.179
I mean, hopefully your car handles
turbulence better than that aeroplane.

12:54.270 --> 12:57.854
I guess we'll find out.
North Carolina, here we come.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.211
These are the best chips I've ever had.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.796
Uh, you're in America.
Call them "French fries."

13:25.890 --> 13:29.007
Of course, aye,
'cause that makes perfect sense.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.806
I can take another shift if you want.

13:33.890 --> 13:35.380
Oh, I don't mind.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.971
I will have more
of that chocolate malt, though.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.708
All right, your turn. "A."

13:57.040 --> 14:00.373
_ The minister's cat
IS an androgynous cat.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.289
The minister's cat is an alagrugous cat.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.752
"Alagrugous," grim or woebegone.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.509
All right.

14:15.140 --> 14:19.179
The minister's cat is a brindled cat.

14:19.270 --> 14:21.977
The minister's cat is a bonnie cat.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.936
All right, that's a draw.

14:26.110 --> 14:29.568
The minister's cat is
a coccydanous cat.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.231
- A cat with a NVide backside?
- o.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.866
A cat that's a pain in the ass.

14:34.830 --> 14:35.819
All right, then...

14:37.210 --> 14:41.283
The minister's cat is a camstairy cat.

14:45.590 --> 14:46.659
What?

14:48.340 --> 14:49.546
You're pretty.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.546
Even though

14:51.640 --> 14:53.005
you have ketchup on your cheek.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.727
- "Pretty"?
- You missed it.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.431
Here.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.729
I mean, "dashing cat"
would've made sense for our game.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.641
"Devilishly handsome cat"
would be a worthy term.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.190
Shut up and kiss me.

15:11.030 --> 15:14.579
Chr_ist! You could've run me
right off the road, lass.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.710
That mountain there,

15:28.380 --> 15:30.792
the Scots of the region
gather there in the autumn

15:30.880 --> 15:33.098
to trade after the harvest's in.

15:33.970 --> 15:36.268
I'm sure you'd
find yourselves at home there.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.768
This area once belonged to the Tuscarora
but you won't see them any more.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.397
The land mostly belongs to Cherokee now.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.181
Cherokee are great warriors, no?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.101
They fight well and fight with honour.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.520
And they do what they must
to guard their lands

15:52.620 --> 15:53.939
from whoever has a mind to take 'em.

15:54.410 --> 15:55.695
Dinna blame 'em.

15:55.780 --> 16:00.740
It's justice for them.
Their way of ma/nta/ning
nvwadohiyadv,

16:01.540 --> 16:02.575
harmony on earth.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.837
You speak Cherokee yourself, Mr Myers?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.205
Oh. A bit.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.332
Mr Myers has spent time
with many an Indian woman.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.888
I don't recall as I put a number on it.

16:15.350 --> 16:19.013
Cherokee women choose who they marry
and, before that, who they bed with.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.590
I love this land.

17:02.770 --> 17:05.056
I must part with you tomorrow
and make my way

17:05.150 --> 17:07.300
to a trading house
some ways north of here.

17:07.770 --> 17:10.933
I have tobacco for the Indians,
and they'll have deerskins for me.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.158
Mr Myers has been kind enough
to ask me to go with him.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.320
Well, you have nothing to fear.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.452
The Indians who come to trade
with the settlers are very civil.

17:24.870 --> 17:27.839
We'll take the wagon
and meet you at Woolam's Creek.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.583
How long have you lived
in these mountains, Mr Myers?

17:33.470 --> 17:34.789
You seem to know them well.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.848
These mountains are old friends to me.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.973
And those who dwell around them
near enough so, too.

17:44.310 --> 17:47.017
Not to worry, mistress,
the lad will be safe.

17:48.270 --> 17:49.817
I promise you both.

17:52.900 --> 17:53.889
Aye.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.313
All right,
just dinna get yer heids scalped.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.070
Uncle Jamie, thank you.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.126
Go help him with the horses, lad.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.166
Come, Rollo.

18:16.590 --> 18:19.138
And we'll be
at Woolam's Creek soon enough.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.249
It's all right.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.171
I rather enjoy being under the stars.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.589
Aye.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.187
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
go to a place ye're more...

18:31.610 --> 18:32.895
familiar with?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.356
Boston, say, or...

18:37.490 --> 18:39.731
Someplace we can start anew?

18:39.820 --> 18:41.026
Boston?

18:42.950 --> 18:44.906
That would hardly be starting anew...

18:45.660 --> 18:46.991
Not for me, at least.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.787
I've already had a life there.

18:52.670 --> 18:56.629
And besides,
it'll be dangerous there soon.

18:57.220 --> 19:01.008
The tensions will be rising.
That's where the Revolution starts.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.175
I want us...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.431
to make a home together...

19:11.270 --> 19:13.067
A place that's ours.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.355
Aye.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.648
So, she could have
her own choice of work?

19:54.650 --> 19:55.810
Well, yes.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.936
In my time,
women had more choices than ever.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.351
Huh. And what was Brianna's choice?

20:01.490 --> 20:03.731
Before I left, she hadn't made one yet.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.735
You know, it's funny.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.195
I've always known what I wanted to be.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.362
It was clear
as far back as I can remember.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.785
You were born to be a healer, then.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.081
I suppose I was.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.956
To be honest, I...

20:19.970 --> 20:23.929
I worried that Brianna couldn't find
something she was passronate about.

20:24.890 --> 20:29.179
You know, she'd try something,
and get bored and move on.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.220
In this time, you're more likely

20:32.640 --> 20:35.438
to take up your family's work
and be thankful for that.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.358
Well, she tried
studying history like Frank...

20:39.400 --> 20:40.981
But then she gave that up.

20:41.070 --> 20:43.356
She never wanted to be
a doctor like you?

20:43.450 --> 20:44.610
No.

20:45.910 --> 20:48.902
No, Frank and Brianna, they...

20:50.540 --> 20:52.360
Well, they spent more time together.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.451
I suppose they had a stronger bond.

20:56.790 --> 20:59.543
I think that's why
she chose history in the first place.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.541
She wanted to please him.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.837
Dinna fash. She'll find her way.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.131
Ye're always telling me
how sharp-witted she is.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.131
Yes, she is.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.359
But there'll never be a day
I don't worry about her.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.271
There's a storm coming.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.026
We'll abide in a tavern
when we reach the town,

21:24.360 --> 21:27.067
until we have enough coin
to put a roof over our heads.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.656
Or perhaps a quaint brothel.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.531
Will ye hold that
over me forever, Sassenach?

21:32.620 --> 21:33.826
Not forever.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.977
You love working with horses.

21:55.060 --> 21:58.518
Ye asking,
or purely making an observation?

21:59.150 --> 22:00.310
An observation.

22:02.650 --> 22:03.935
And printing?

22:05.990 --> 22:07.400
Canna sayI loved it.

22:08.030 --> 22:09.236
Was good at it.

22:09.830 --> 22:13.402
Kept my mind agile
and my body in good strength too.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.167
Will it be enough for you now?

22:18.130 --> 22:21.998
I mean, you were
also a smuggler and a seditionist.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.042
A man should be settled
at my age, you know?

22:25.840 --> 22:26.875
Besides...

22:27.630 --> 22:30.849
I thought you said ye wanted to live
in a town in the backcountry?

22:31.220 --> 22:33.211
- Ye said we'd be safer.
- I did.

22:34.180 --> 22:37.843
I just don't want you making this decision
because you think it's what I want.

22:39.690 --> 22:43.933
There's a phrase
that becomes important in America.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.356
"The pursuit of happiness."

22:49.030 --> 22:51.908
Ye dinna think I can be happy
unless I'm a criminal?

22:53.580 --> 22:55.445
I was an outlaw when first we met...

22:56.960 --> 22:58.780
and an outlaw when you returned.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.959
If it was only me...
I would live as one again.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.961
And when I was auld,
I would lie under a tree

23:08.050 --> 23:10.837
and let the wolves gnaw at my bones,
but it's not just me.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.749
It's you...

23:16.270 --> 23:17.419
And Ian...

23:19.060 --> 23:20.721
Fergus, Marsali.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.265
You understand?

23:24.270 --> 23:26.852
I would lay the world
at your feet, Claire...

23:28.570 --> 23:30.197
but I have nothing to give you.

23:39.290 --> 23:42.919
The storm's upon us.
We'll make camp here.

23:52.890 --> 23:53.879
Christ.

23:53.970 --> 23:55.756
- Stupid mule.
- I'll go get him.

23:55.850 --> 23:57.966
Claire, he'll no' go far.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.512
In that case, he'll be easy to find.

24:00.850 --> 24:02.090
Claire.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.451
Registration for the Calling of the Clans

24:25.540 --> 24:28.088
can be found at booth five.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.759
Da/ly dancing lessons
wﬂl take place from noon 177/ 3:00.

24:38.850 --> 24:41.478
My mother always said
men in kilts were irresistible.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.896
She was right.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.817
Well, you look lovely yourself.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.810
Smile for the camera.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.276
Hey, look, cotton candy!

24:57.740 --> 25:02.325
Don ’t forget that the burning of the
stag wﬂl take place tomorrow night.

25:13.180 --> 25:16.001
I had no idea there were_
so many Scots In North Carolina.

25:16.090 --> 25:19.253
They say it was settled by them
in the 18th century.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.262
I hope it's not upsetting for you,
being here.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.891
No, no.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.476
It's just... It does make me
think of my mother.

25:29.150 --> 25:33.484
I wonder if she ever made it back,
found Jamie, if she's happy.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.236
I like to believe she did.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.445
Scottish shortbread is now ava/lab/e

25:40.540 --> 25:42.690
for purchase at the marketplace.

25:45.330 --> 25:47.787
Hey, I've always wanted
to have my portrait done.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.450
Ooh, that makes one of us.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.831
So, what clan?

25:51.920 --> 25:55.378
I don't have a clan...
I mean, I guess I'm a Fraser.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.886
But my boyfriend's a MacKenzie.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.711
So, then how about
a drawing of the two of them?

26:03.180 --> 26:04.727
We've got a MacKenzie tartan
you can wear.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.801
Yeah, sounds great.
Two MacKenzie tartans.

26:08.190 --> 26:10.852
Come on, we don't have
a single picture of us together.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.732
Well, you better focus on my good side.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.985
The haggis-eahng contest

26:22.080 --> 26:24.958
wﬂl begin in 15 m/nutes in tent one.

26:37.300 --> 26:39.382
Well, that looks like fun.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.217
The cilidh dance? Aye, it's good fun.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.959
It's a bit triclq, though.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.097
"Try your hand and feet
at cilidh dancing.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.841
- "Live a long and happy life."
- Or die trying.

26:53.150 --> 26:54.777
- Let's do it.
- Aye.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.405
Go.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.115
You want to be next?

27:05.200 --> 27:07.202
- Sure.
- Have you done it before?

27:07.290 --> 27:08.666
Never, but he has.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.491
He'll be a good partner, then.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.337
Grab his hand and spin for 16 beats.

27:13.420 --> 27:14.626
Like this.

27:14.710 --> 27:16.962
- And...
- Like this.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.579
Go.

28:23.950 --> 28:24.939
Claire!

28:40.880 --> 28:41.869
Claire!

28:52.690 --> 28:54.146
Clarence!

28:55.190 --> 28:56.646
Where are you?

28:57.900 --> 28:59.720
Easy, boy, easy.

29:02.150 --> 29:03.139
Damn it.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.696
Where am I?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.416
Now, for something a little different.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.774
I once loved a lass

30:24.860 --> 30:31.277
I loved her sae wee/

30:32.290 --> 30:35.362
I hated all others

30:35.460 --> 30:39.203
7'hat spoke of her /7/

30:42.590 --> 30:46.924
But now, she’s rewarded me well

30:47.010 --> 30:49.501
For my love

30:51.260 --> 30:57.221
For she’s gone to be wed to another

31:03.070 --> 31:07.063
I saw my love

31:07.150 --> 31:13.271
Sit down to dine

31:13.370 --> 31:16.191
As I sat down beside her

31:16.290 --> 31:19.202
I poured out her wine

31:22.880 --> 31:25.587
And I drank to the lassie

31:25.670 --> 31:29.709
That should have been mine

31:31.140 --> 31:33.506
For now

31:33.680 --> 31:39.721
She is wed to another

31:42.060 --> 31:45.939
The men 0 ’ the forest

31:46.150 --> 31:52.157
Ask it o ’ me

31:52.820 --> 31:55.368
How many strawberries

31:55.490 --> 31:59.403
Grow in the south sea?

32:02.290 --> 32:04.997
And I answer them a ’

32:05.130 --> 32:08.873
With a tear in my ee

32:10.430 --> 32:13.172
How many ships sa/l

32:13.260 --> 32:16.172
In the forest?

32:44.790 --> 32:47.247
I still can't believe
what a great mu5ICIan you are.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.001
What other talents
have you been keeping from me?

32:50.090 --> 32:51.216
I'll never tell.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.579
Well...

33:13.860 --> 33:15.191
Well, good night, Brianna.

33:19.120 --> 33:24.069
Remember, if you need anything,
my cabin's... like it's right here,

33:24.500 --> 33:25.489
SO...

33:29.130 --> 33:30.290
Wait, I...

33:30.550 --> 33:34.122
I bought you something
while you were getting ready to perform.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.958
’54 Home from Home:
Scottish Settlers in Colonial America. ”

33:42.480 --> 33:43.469
Thank you.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.472
I figured you already know
about the Scots in Scotland...

33:48.360 --> 33:52.103
And your favourite beverage,
Mountain Moonshine.

33:53.650 --> 33:56.278
How did you get that? It's a dry county.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.310
I asked around.

34:00.370 --> 34:01.359
Shall we?

34:03.290 --> 34:04.860
Maybe just a wee dram.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.541
His eyes are following me.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.131
I know. It's creepy.

34:18.430 --> 34:21.251
I'll have to put something over his face
before I go to bed.

34:27.730 --> 34:32.224
He's pretty canty-looking
for a deer on the worst day of his life.

34:33.150 --> 34:35.061
You're half the deer you used to be...

34:40.780 --> 34:42.111
Christ.

34:43.490 --> 34:45.242
Oh, you're a snealq one.

35:08.730 --> 35:09.719
Wait.

35:10.190 --> 35:12.010
What? What's the matter?

35:13.070 --> 35:14.685
I want this to be perfect.

35:18.490 --> 35:19.809
It is perfect.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.200
Come here.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.342
- What's this?
- Open it.

35:54.230 --> 36:00.021
”Je t’a/me un peu, beaucoup,
passionnment pas du tout. ”

36:01.530 --> 36:05.409
"I love you a little, a lot,
passionately, not at all"?

36:05.490 --> 36:07.287
It's from a French children's rhyme.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.032
They recite it when they're picking
the petals from a flower.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.206
I mean, it was...

36:14.750 --> 36:16.991
It was just supposed to be
a present, but you're right.

36:17.090 --> 36:18.660
This is perfect.

36:19.050 --> 36:20.836
This whole weekend's been perfect.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.420
I want you, Brianna.

36:25.470 --> 36:28.132
I cannot say it more plainly than that.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.220
I love you.

36:36.190 --> 36:37.396
Will you marry me?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.361
Roger, this is very fast.

36:44.910 --> 36:45.979
Aye...

36:46.450 --> 36:50.079
Aye, I mean, we can have
as long an engagement as ye'd like.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.072
I just... I want you to say yes.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.240
I want to give ye my name.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.878
I want, when the MacKenzies stand
at the Calling of the Clans tomorrow,

36:59.960 --> 37:02.872
for you to stand by my side,
knowing one day...

37:02.970 --> 37:03.959
you'll be my wife.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.131
I want to have a home with you.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.553
I want to have a home big enough
for four or five wee MacKenzies,

37:11.810 --> 37:12.799
a couple of dogs--

37:12.890 --> 37:14.050
Roger, Roger, stop.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.477
I'm not ready for this.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.246
All right, well...

37:34.710 --> 37:36.075
Nae bother.

37:40.550 --> 37:41.665
Roger...

37:47.010 --> 37:50.923
- What in God's name are you playing at?
- You said you wanted me.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.380
I want you, too. Don't you know that?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.937
Ye don't want to marry me,
but you'll fuck me?

37:56.650 --> 37:58.436
You don't have to use that language.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.318
Oh, you can suggest such a thing,
but I cannot say the word?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.851
If all I wanted
was to have my way with you,

38:04.950 --> 38:07.817
I would have had ye on your back
a dozen times last summer.

38:17.380 --> 38:20.201
If you don't care enough to marry me...

38:22.550 --> 38:24.836
then I don't care enough
to have ye in my bed.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.580
- That makes no sense.
- Well, neither do you!

38:29.260 --> 38:32.138
Roger, you can't just spring
a proposal on me.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.347
I have school, an apartment.

38:34.430 --> 38:36.182
I haven't even thought about kids.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.436
a nice Catholic girl?

38:40.940 --> 38:43.397
- I thought you were a virgin.
-Iam.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.186
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

38:45.570 --> 38:47.060
Don't tell me you haven't had girls.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.811
- I know you have.
- Aye, I have.

38:49.070 --> 38:51.322
Then you're a hypocrite.

38:51.410 --> 38:53.401
What, because
I didn't want to marry them?

38:53.620 --> 38:57.363
No, because you'll have sex with a
woman, but you'll only marry a virgin?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.120
It's 1970.

38:59.210 --> 39:01.087
_ _ No one I know _
IS saVIng themselves for marriage.

39:01.170 --> 39:04.298
So I'm old-fashioned!
You're missing the point!

39:04.380 --> 39:05.586
The point is...

39:08.260 --> 39:10.000
The point is, I didn't love them.

39:11.930 --> 39:13.750
I love you, damn it.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.646
But you don't love me.

39:21.230 --> 39:22.606
I didn't say that.

39:24.610 --> 39:25.850
You didn't have to.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.936
Jamie!

40:27.510 --> 40:28.499
Claire?

40:33.140 --> 40:34.209
Claire!

41:32.280 --> 41:33.486
Claire?

41:43.910 --> 41:44.911
Easy.

41:45.370 --> 41:46.371
Easy now.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.409
Claire!

42:41.060 --> 42:42.630
Did this belong to you?

42:56.650 --> 42:57.730
Jamie?

42:58.700 --> 42:59.689
Jamie!

43:01.740 --> 43:03.037
Jamie, thank...

43:18.130 --> 43:19.427
Who are you?

43:21.050 --> 43:22.256
What do you want?

45:02.450 --> 45:04.156
Mind if I join you?

45:14.580 --> 45:16.707
- Yeah, I didn't mean to--
- Look, I'm really--

45:19.920 --> 45:21.797
I really hate the way we left things.

45:21.880 --> 45:22.869
Me too.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.387
Have you changed your mind?

45:29.010 --> 45:30.011
No.

45:40.440 --> 45:41.850
I can't do this.

45:43.030 --> 45:44.236
Pretend everything's...

45:46.570 --> 45:48.151
I don't even know what.

45:48.450 --> 45:51.362
Look, I never said marriage
was out of the question.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.701
That's enthusiastic.

45:54.290 --> 45:57.874
My mother married the man she loved,
but later found her true soul mate.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.246
So, what, you're waiting
for someone better to come along?

46:00.340 --> 46:01.830
- Is that it?
- No.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.876
- That is not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

46:03.970 --> 46:06.131
That maybe I don't believe
in marriage at all.

46:09.760 --> 46:12.513
Let the Calling
of the Clans begin.

46:13.430 --> 46:14.636
Clan Stewart.

46:19.570 --> 46:20.685
The Stewarts are here!

46:24.070 --> 46:25.310
Clan Gordon.

46:27.780 --> 46:29.907
The Gordons are here!

46:31.990 --> 46:33.537
Clan Macdonald.

46:35.330 --> 46:37.742
- Roger?
- Macdonalds are here.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.245
Clan Craig.

46:42.590 --> 46:44.546
Brianna, I'll have you all...

46:45.380 --> 46:46.586
or not at all.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.007
The Craigs are here!

46:51.890 --> 46:53.630
Clan Sutherland.

46:53.720 --> 46:54.846
Here...

46:55.350 --> 46:56.590
You should have this back.

46:57.640 --> 46:58.971
The Sutherlands are here.

46:59.060 --> 47:01.722
No, keep it. It was a gift.

47:02.230 --> 47:04.528
And Clan MacKenzie.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.205
The MacKenzies are here!

47:31.640 --> 47:33.676
Let's burn the stag!

48:17.850 --> 48:19.761
Tulach rd!

51:15.570 --> 51:16.639
Claire?

51:28.670 --> 51:29.955
Christ.

51:31.210 --> 51:33.622
- Are you hurt?
- No.

51:35.130 --> 51:37.007
I'm just so glad I found you.

51:37.420 --> 51:39.627
Ye're the one that was lost, Sassenach.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.382
I'm just glad you had
your wits to come back here.

51:44.100 --> 51:45.215
"Back here"?

51:46.520 --> 51:48.841
What do you mean?
I've never been here before.

51:49.810 --> 51:50.890
What about those?

51:56.780 --> 51:58.441
How did you get those?

52:00.740 --> 52:03.573
They were here by the stream,
side by side.

52:04.160 --> 52:08.278
I wondered why you'd just gone off
in your stocking feet.

52:10.080 --> 52:15.996
Did you see anybody nearby, or anything?

52:16.210 --> 52:18.713
No. No, just your horse.

52:19.470 --> 52:23.383
And I had a devil of a time tracking you
through the woods in the storm.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.883
And once it abated,
I followed yer footprints here.

52:28.140 --> 52:29.175
Me too.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.687
I've never seen this stream before.

52:33.440 --> 52:37.149
And those are my boots,
but I didn't walk here in them.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.309
Then who did?

52:43.320 --> 52:46.278
I saw an Indian, or...

52:46.910 --> 52:48.286
Well, a ghost of an Indian.

52:48.370 --> 52:49.496
A ghost?

52:50.830 --> 52:52.957
I found this skull. I think it's his.

52:55.250 --> 52:59.254
I think he used my boots to lead me...

53:00.300 --> 53:02.086
Us, here.

53:03.510 --> 53:04.499
Aye.

53:05.390 --> 53:09.759
I suppose we should be grateful to
whatever spirit brought us back together.

53:13.690 --> 53:18.935
Jamie, those things you said yesterday
about having nothing to give me--

53:19.030 --> 53:21.396
Dinna fash, Sassenach.

53:23.990 --> 53:26.948
Ye had a harrowing night.
You should wash.

53:27.990 --> 53:29.946
Get some rest. Hmm?

53:55.190 --> 53:56.509
Oh, my God.

54:04.110 --> 54:05.270
Jamie.

54:06.950 --> 54:09.236
- What is it?
- Do you see this?

54:10.580 --> 54:12.195
It's a silver filling,

54:12.700 --> 54:15.612
something that won't be invented
for another 100 years.

54:18.750 --> 54:19.739
So, he was--

54:19.840 --> 54:24.755
He has to be someone like me,
someone who's travelled through time.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.346
Who were you?

54:56.330 --> 54:58.036
- Jamie, look.
- Aye?

54:58.460 --> 54:59.700
Strawberries.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.371
I havena seen any for a long time.

55:07.300 --> 55:09.177
-Mmm.
- The emblem of the Fraser clan.

55:11.140 --> 55:12.209
Mmm.

55:14.020 --> 55:16.727
Hark/ng back to
Monsieur
Frsellre.

55:17.730 --> 55:19.266
Came across from France...

55:20.020 --> 55:23.319
took hold of land
in the Scottish Highlands.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.529
Frselire? Mister Strawberry?

55:27.860 --> 55:29.407
What, he grew them, did he?

55:29.700 --> 55:31.486
Or was he just fond of eating them?

55:37.620 --> 55:41.624
This must be the most beautiful land
I've ever seen.

55:42.710 --> 55:44.701
It's hard
to take your eyes off it.

55:49.130 --> 55:52.429
It's good land, no doubt about it.

55:55.140 --> 55:59.383
Now, that meadow below
would do for a few animals...

56:00.850 --> 56:03.978
And the land near the river
could be cleared for crops.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.066
I know that look
on your face, Jamie Fraser.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.900
You're in love.

56:15.990 --> 56:19.118
A good man would choose a safer path.

56:20.420 --> 56:24.993
And we intended to live in the town,
not here in the wilderness wi' nothing.

56:27.670 --> 56:31.219
But what it is
to feel the need of a place.

56:37.890 --> 56:40.302
But we'd have to accept
Governor Tryon's offer...

56:41.390 --> 56:42.721
A deal with the Devil.

56:43.610 --> 56:44.929
We both ken it.

56:48.030 --> 56:52.069
For so long, I've dreamt of you and I...

56:53.450 --> 56:56.942
having a home together,
a place of our own.

57:05.630 --> 57:07.040
Do ye trust me, Claire?

57:10.340 --> 57:11.876
With my life.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.080
And with your heart?

57:16.640 --> 57:17.629
Always.

57:23.230 --> 57:26.609
Then this will be our home.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.025
And we'll call it...

57:37.030 --> 57:38.327
Fraser's Ridge.
